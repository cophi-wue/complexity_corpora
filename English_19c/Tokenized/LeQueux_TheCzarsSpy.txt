"
There
was
a
mysterious
affair
last
night
,
signore
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Anything
that
interests
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
signore
,
"
replied
the
tall
,
thin
Italian
Consular
-
clerk
,
speaking
with
a
strong
accent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
English
steam
yacht
ran
aground
on
the
Meloria
about
ten
miles
out
,
and
was
discovered
by
a
fishing
-
boat
who
brought
the
news
to
harbor
.
<EOS>
The
Admiral
sent
out
two
torpedo
-
boats
,
which
managed
after
a
lot
of
difficulty
to
bring
in
the
yacht
safely
,
but
the
Captain
of
the
Port
has
a
suspicion
that
the
crew
were
trying
to
make
away
with
the
vessel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
lose
her
,
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
faithful
Francesco
,
whose
English
had
mostly
been
acquired
from
sea
-
faring
men
,
and
was
not
the
choicest
vocabulary
,
nodded
,
and
,
true
Tuscan
that
he
was
,
placed
his
finger
upon
his
closed
lips
,
indicative
of
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sounds
curious
,
"
I
remarked
.
"
<EOS>
Since
the
Consul
went
away
on
leave
things
seem
to
have
been
humming
--
two
stabbing
affrays
,
eight
drunken
seamen
locked
up
,
a
mutiny
on
a
tramp
steamer
,
and
now
a
yacht
being
cast
away
--
a
fairly
decent
list
!
<EOS>
And
yet
some
stay
-
at
-
home
people
complain
that
British
consuls
are
only
paid
to
be
ornamental
!
<EOS>
They
should
spend
a
week
here
,
at
Leghorn
,
and
they
'd
soon
alter
their
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
would
,
signore
,
"
responded
the
thin
-
faced
old
fellow
with
a
grin
,
as
he
twisted
his
fierce
gray
mustache
.
<EOS>
Francesco
Carducci
was
a
well
-
known
character
in
Leghorn
;
interpreter
to
the
Consulate
,
and
keeper
of
a
sailor
's
home
,
an
honest
,
good
-
hearted
,
easy
-
going
fellow
,
who
for
twenty
years
had
occupied
the
same
position
under
half
a
dozen
different
Consuls
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
however
,
there
came
from
the
outer
office
a
long
-
drawn
moan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
,
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
enquired
,
startled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
a
mad
stoker
off
the
_
Oleander
_
,
signore
.
<EOS>
The
captain
has
brought
him
for
you
to
see
.
<EOS>
They
want
to
send
him
back
to
his
friends
at
Newcastle
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
a
case
of
madness
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Better
get
Doctor
Ridolfi
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
an
expert
on
mental
diseases
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
old
friend
Frank
Hutcheson
,
His
Britannic
Majesty
's
Vice
-
Consul
at
the
port
of
Leghorn
,
was
away
on
leave
in
England
,
his
duties
being
relegated
to
young
Bertram
Cavendish
,
the
pro
-
Consul
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
however
,
had
gone
down
with
a
bad
touch
of
malaria
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
deadly
Maremma
,
and
I
,
as
the
only
other
Englishman
in
Leghorn
,
had
been
asked
by
the
Consul
-
General
in
Florence
to
act
as
pro
-
Consul
until
Hutcheson
's
return
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
mid
-
July
,
and
the
weather
was
blazing
in
the
glaring
sun
-
blanched
Mediterranean
town
.
<EOS>
If
you
know
Leghorn
,
you
probably
know
the
Consulate
with
its
black
and
yellow
escutcheon
outside
,
a
large
,
handsome
suite
of
huge
,
airy
offices
facing
the
cathedral
,
and
overlooking
the
principal
piazza
,
which
is
as
big
as
Trafalgar
Square
,
and
much
more
picturesque
.
<EOS>
The
legend
painted
upon
the
door
,
"
Office
hours
,
10
to
3
,
"
and
the
green
persiennes
closed
against
the
scorching
sun
give
one
the
idea
of
an
easy
appointment
,
but
such
is
certainly
not
the
case
,
for
a
Consul
's
life
at
a
port
of
discharge
must
necessarily
be
a
very
active
one
,
and
his
duties
never
-
ending
.
 
<EOS>
Carducci
had
left
me
to
the
correspondence
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
and
I
confess
I
was
in
no
mood
to
write
replies
in
that
stifling
heat
,
therefore
I
sat
at
the
Consul
's
big
table
,
smoking
a
cigarette
and
stretched
lazily
in
my
friend
's
chair
,
resolving
to
escape
to
the
cool
of
England
as
soon
as
he
returned
in
the
following
week
.
<EOS>
Italy
is
all
very
well
for
nine
months
in
the
year
,
but
Leghorn
is
no
place
for
the
Englishman
in
mid
-
July
.
<EOS>
My
thoughts
were
wandering
toward
the
English
lakes
,
and
a
bit
of
grouse
-
shooting
with
my
uncle
up
in
Scotland
,
when
the
faithful
Francesco
re
-
entered
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
sent
the
captain
and
his
madman
away
till
this
afternoon
,
signore
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
an
English
signore
waiting
to
see
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
give
no
name
,
but
wants
to
see
the
Signor
Console
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
show
him
in
,
"
I
said
lazily
,
and
a
few
moments
later
a
tall
,
smartly
-
dressed
,
middle
-
aged
Englishman
,
in
a
navy
serge
yachting
suit
,
entered
,
and
bowing
,
enquired
whether
I
was
the
British
Consul
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
seated
himself
I
explained
my
position
,
whereupon
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
make
much
out
of
your
clerk
.
<EOS>
He
speaks
so
brokenly
,
and
I
do
n't
know
a
word
of
Italian
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
I
ought
to
first
introduce
myself
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
Philip
Hornby
,
"
and
he
handed
me
a
card
bearing
the
name
with
the
addresses
"
Woodcroft
Park
,
Somerset
<EOS>
------
<EOS>
Brook
's
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
added
:
"
I
am
cruising
on
board
my
yacht
,
the
_
Lola
_
,
and
last
night
we
unfortunately
went
aground
on
the
Meloria
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
new
captain
whom
I
engaged
a
few
months
ago
,
and
he
seems
an
arrant
fool
.
<EOS>
Very
fortunately
for
us
a
fishing
-
boat
saw
our
plight
and
gave
the
alarm
at
port
.
<EOS>
The
Admiral
sent
out
two
torpedo
-
boats
and
a
tug
,
and
after
about
three
hours
they
managed
to
get
us
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
now
in
harbor
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
the
reason
I
've
called
is
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favor
and
write
me
a
letter
of
thanks
in
Italian
to
the
Admiral
,
and
one
to
the
Captain
of
the
Port
--
polite
letters
that
I
can
copy
and
send
to
them
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
I
replied
,
the
more
interested
in
him
on
account
of
the
curious
suspicion
that
the
port
authorities
seemed
to
entertain
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
a
gentleman
,
and
after
I
had
been
with
him
ten
minutes
I
scouted
the
idea
that
he
had
endeavored
to
cast
away
the
_
Lola
_
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
down
a
couple
of
sheets
of
paper
and
scribbled
the
drafts
of
two
letters
couched
in
the
most
elegant
phraseology
,
as
is
customary
when
addressing
Italian
officialdom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fortunately
,
I
left
my
wife
in
England
,
or
she
would
have
been
terribly
frightened
,
"
he
remarked
presently
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
nasty
wind
blowing
all
night
,
and
the
fool
of
a
captain
seemed
to
add
to
our
peril
by
every
order
he
gave
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
alone
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
friend
with
me
,
"
was
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
many
of
the
crew
are
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sixteen
,
all
told
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
English
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
all
.
<EOS>
I
find
French
and
Italians
are
more
sober
than
English
,
and
better
behaved
in
port
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
examined
him
critically
as
he
sat
facing
me
,
and
the
mere
fact
of
his
desire
to
send
thanks
to
the
authorities
convinced
me
that
he
was
a
well
-
bred
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
forty
-
five
,
with
a
merry
round
,
good
-
natured
face
,
red
with
the
southern
sun
,
blue
eyes
,
and
a
short
fair
beard
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
essentially
that
of
a
man
devoted
to
open
-
air
sport
,
for
it
was
slightly
furrowed
and
weather
-
beaten
as
a
true
yachtsman
's
should
be
.
<EOS>
His
speech
was
refined
and
cultivated
,
and
as
we
chatted
he
gave
me
the
impression
that
as
an
enthusiastic
lover
of
the
sea
,
he
had
cruised
the
Mediterranean
many
times
from
Gibraltar
up
to
Smyrna
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
never
before
put
into
Leghorn
.
 
<EOS>
After
we
had
arranged
that
his
captain
should
come
to
me
in
the
afternoon
and
make
a
formal
report
of
the
accident
,
we
went
out
together
across
the
white
sunny
piazza
to
Nasi
's
,
the
well
-
known
pastry
-
cook
's
,
where
it
is
the
habit
of
the
Livornese
to
take
their
ante
-
luncheon
vermouth
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
I
saw
of
Hornby
,
the
more
I
liked
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
chatty
and
witty
,
and
treated
his
accident
as
a
huge
joke
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
here
quite
a
week
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
he
said
as
we
were
taking
our
vermouth
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
on
our
way
down
to
the
Greek
Islands
,
as
my
friend
Chater
wants
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
The
engineer
says
there
's
something
strained
that
we
must
get
mended
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
the
way
,
"
he
added
,
"
why
do
n't
you
dine
with
us
on
board
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
Do
.
<EOS>
We
can
give
you
a
few
English
things
that
may
be
a
change
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
invitation
I
gladly
accepted
for
two
reasons
.
<EOS>
One
was
because
the
suspicions
of
the
Captain
of
the
Port
had
aroused
my
curiosity
,
and
the
other
was
because
I
had
,
honestly
speaking
,
taken
a
great
fancy
to
Hornby
.
 
<EOS>
The
captain
of
the
_
Lola
_
,
a
short
,
thickset
Scotsman
from
Dundee
,
with
a
barely
healed
cicatrice
across
his
left
cheek
,
called
at
the
Consulate
at
two
o'clock
and
made
his
report
,
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
very
lame
one
.
<EOS>
He
struck
me
as
being
unworthy
his
certificate
,
for
he
was
evidently
entirely
out
of
his
bearings
when
the
accident
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
owner
and
his
friend
Chater
were
in
their
berths
asleep
,
when
suddenly
he
discovered
that
the
vessel
was
making
no
headway
.
<EOS>
They
had
,
in
fact
,
run
upon
the
dangerous
shoal
without
being
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
A
strong
sea
was
running
with
a
stiff
breeze
,
and
although
his
seamanship
was
poor
,
he
was
capable
enough
to
recognize
at
once
that
they
were
in
a
very
perilous
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
fortunate
it
was
n't
more
serious
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
after
telling
me
his
story
,
which
I
wrote
at
his
dictation
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
the
Board
of
Trade
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
send
up
signals
of
distress
?
<EOS>
"
I
Inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
--
never
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
knew
that
you
might
be
lost
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
with
recurring
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
The
canny
Scot
,
whose
name
was
Mackintosh
,
hesitated
a
few
moments
,
then
answered--
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
you
see
the
fishing
-
boat
had
sighted
us
,
and
we
saw
her
turning
back
to
port
to
fetch
help
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
excuse
was
a
neat
one
.
<EOS>
Probably
it
was
his
neglect
to
make
signals
of
distress
that
had
aroused
the
suspicions
of
the
Captain
of
the
Port
.
<EOS>
From
first
to
last
the
story
of
the
master
of
the
_
Lola
_
<EOS>
was
,
I
considered
,
a
very
unsatisfactory
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
long
have
you
been
in
Mr.
Hornby
's
service
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Six
months
,
sir
,
"
was
the
man
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Before
he
engaged
me
,
I
was
with
the
Wilsons
,
of
Hull
,
running
up
the
Baltic
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
master
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
held
my
master
's
certificate
these
fifteen
years
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
was
with
the
Bibbys
before
the
Wilsons
,
and
before
that
with
the
General
Steam
.
<EOS>
I
did
eight
years
in
the
Mediterranean
with
them
,
when
I
was
chief
mate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
've
never
been
into
Leghorn
before
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
dismissed
the
captain
with
a
distinct
impression
that
he
had
not
told
me
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
That
cicatrice
did
not
improve
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
his
certificates
on
board
,
he
said
,
but
if
I
wished
he
would
bring
them
to
me
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
an
attempt
had
actually
been
made
to
cast
away
the
yacht
,
and
that
it
had
been
frustrated
by
the
master
of
the
felucca
,
who
had
sighted
the
vessel
aground
?
<EOS>
There
certainly
seemed
some
mystery
surrounding
the
circumstances
,
and
my
interest
in
the
yacht
and
its
owner
deepened
each
hour
.
<EOS>
How
,
I
wondered
,
had
the
captain
received
that
very
ugly
wound
across
the
cheek
?
<EOS>
I
was
half
-
inclined
to
inquire
of
him
,
but
on
reflection
decided
that
it
was
best
to
betray
no
undue
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
That
evening
when
the
fiery
sun
was
sinking
in
its
crimson
glory
,
bathing
the
glassy
sea
with
its
blood
-
red
light
and
causing
the
islands
of
Gorgona
and
Capraja
to
loom
forth
a
deep
purple
against
the
distant
horizon
,
I
took
a
cab
along
the
old
sea
-
road
to
the
port
where
,
within
the
inner
harbor
,
I
found
the
_
Lola
_
,
one
of
the
most
magnificent
private
vessels
I
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
Her
dimensions
surprised
me
.
<EOS>
She
was
painted
dead
white
,
with
shining
brass
everywhere
.
<EOS>
At
the
stern
hung
limply
the
British
flag
,
while
at
the
masthead
the
ensign
of
the
Royal
Yacht
Squadron
.
<EOS>
The
yellow
funnel
emitted
no
smoke
,
and
as
she
lay
calmly
in
the
sunset
a
crowd
of
dock
-
loungers
and
crimps
leaned
upon
the
parapet
discussing
her
merits
and
wondering
who
could
be
the
rich
Englishman
who
could
afford
to
travel
in
a
small
liner
of
his
own
--
for
her
size
surprised
even
those
Italian
dock
-
hands
,
used
as
they
were
to
seeing
every
kind
of
craft
enter
the
busy
port
.
 
<EOS>
On
stepping
on
deck
Hornby
,
who
like
myself
wore
a
clean
suit
of
white
linen
as
the
most
sensible
dinner
-
garb
in
a
hot
climate
,
came
forward
to
greet
me
,
and
took
me
along
to
the
stern
where
,
lying
in
a
long
wicker
deck
-
chair
beneath
the
awning
,
was
a
tall
,
dark
-
eyed
,
clean
-
shaven
man
of
about
forty
,
also
dressed
in
cool
white
linen
.
<EOS>
His
keen
face
gave
one
the
impression
that
he
was
a
barrister
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
Hylton
Chater
--
Mr
.
<EOS>
Gordon
Gregg
,
"
he
said
,
introducing
us
,
and
then
when
,
as
we
shook
hands
,
the
clean
-
shaven
man
exclaimed
,
smiling
pleasantly--
 
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
a
stranger
by
any
means
to
Hornby
or
myself
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
we
've
got
a
couple
of
your
books
on
board
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
no
idea
you
lived
out
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
Ardenza
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Three
miles
along
the
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
both
come
and
dine
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Delighted
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
declared
Hornby
.
<EOS>
"
To
eat
ashore
is
quite
a
treat
when
one
has
been
boxed
up
on
board
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
So
we
'll
accept
,
wo
n't
we
,
Hylton
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
the
other
;
and
then
we
began
chatting
about
the
peril
of
the
previous
night
,
Hornby
telling
me
how
he
had
copied
the
two
letters
of
thanks
in
Italian
and
sent
them
to
their
respective
addresses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Phil
blasphemed
like
a
Levant
skipper
when
he
copied
those
Italian
words
!
"
laughed
Chater
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
made
three
copies
of
each
letter
before
he
could
get
all
the
lingo
in
accordance
with
your
copy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
the
whole
afternoon
at
them
--
confound
them
!
"
declared
the
owner
of
the
_
Lola
_
with
a
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
I
did
n't
want
to
make
a
lot
of
errors
in
spelling
.
<EOS>
These
Italians
are
so
very
punctilious
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
certainly
did
the
right
thing
to
thank
the
Admiral
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
unusual
for
him
to
send
out
torpedo
-
boats
to
help
a
vessel
in
distress
.
<EOS>
That
is
generally
left
to
the
harbor
tug
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
feel
that
it
was
most
kind
of
him
.
<EOS>
That
's
why
I
took
all
the
trouble
to
write
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
a
word
of
Italian
,
neither
does
Chater
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
Italians
on
board
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
The
two
sailors
who
rowed
me
out
are
Genoese
,
from
their
accent
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hornby
and
Chater
exchanged
glances
--
glances
of
distinct
uneasiness
,
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
owner
of
the
_
Lola
_
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
are
useful
for
making
arrangements
and
buying
things
in
Italian
ports
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
Spaniard
,
a
Greek
,
and
a
Syrian
,
all
of
whom
act
as
interpreters
in
different
places
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
make
a
handsome
thing
in
the
way
of
secret
commissions
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
I
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
But
to
cruise
in
comfort
one
must
pay
and
be
pleasant
,
"
declared
the
man
with
the
fair
beard
.
<EOS>
"
In
Greece
and
the
Levant
they
are
more
rapacious
than
in
Naples
,
and
the
Customs
officers
always
want
squaring
,
otherwise
they
are
for
ever
rummaging
and
discovering
mares
'
nests
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
have
any
trouble
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
did
n't
visit
us
,
"
he
said
with
a
smile
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
rubbed
his
thumb
and
finger
together
,
the
action
of
feeling
paper
money
.
 
<EOS>
This
increased
my
surprise
,
for
I
happened
to
know
that
the
Leghorn
Customs
officers
were
not
at
all
given
to
the
acceptance
of
bribes
.
<EOS>
They
were
too
well
watched
by
their
superiors
.
<EOS>
If
the
yacht
had
really
escaped
a
search
,
then
it
was
a
most
unusual
thing
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
what
motive
could
Hornby
have
in
eluding
the
Customs
visit
?
<EOS>
They
would
,
of
course
,
seal
up
his
wines
and
liquors
,
but
even
if
they
did
,
they
would
leave
him
out
sufficient
for
the
consumption
of
himself
and
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Philip
Hornby
had
some
strong
motive
in
paying
a
heavy
bribe
to
avoid
the
visit
of
the
_
dogana
_
.
<EOS>
If
he
really
had
paid
,
he
must
have
paid
very
heavily
;
of
that
I
was
convinced
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
some
mystery
was
hidden
on
board
that
splendidly
appointed
craft
?
 
<EOS>
Presently
the
gong
sounded
,
and
we
went
below
into
the
elegantly
fitted
saloon
,
where
was
spread
a
table
that
sparkled
with
cut
glass
and
shone
with
silver
.
<EOS>
Around
the
center
fresh
flowers
had
been
trailed
by
some
artistic
hand
,
while
on
the
buffet
at
the
end
the
necks
of
wine
bottles
peered
out
from
the
ice
pails
.
<EOS>
Both
carpet
and
upholstery
were
in
pale
blue
,
while
everywhere
it
was
apparent
that
none
but
an
extremely
wealthy
man
could
afford
such
a
magnificent
craft
.
 
<EOS>
Hornby
took
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
we
sat
on
either
side
of
him
,
chatting
merrily
while
we
ate
one
of
the
choicest
and
best
cooked
dinners
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
taste
.
<EOS>
Chater
and
I
drank
wine
of
a
brand
which
only
a
millionaire
could
keep
in
his
cellar
,
while
our
host
,
apparently
a
most
abstemious
man
,
took
only
a
glass
of
iced
Cinciano
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
smart
stewards
served
in
a
manner
which
showed
them
to
be
well
trained
to
their
duties
,
and
as
the
evening
light
filtering
through
the
pale
blue
silk
curtains
over
the
open
port
-
holes
slowly
faded
,
we
gossiped
on
as
men
will
gossip
over
an
unusually
good
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
From
his
remarks
I
discerned
that
,
contrary
to
my
first
impression
,
Hylton
Chater
was
an
experienced
yachtsman
.
<EOS>
He
owned
a
craft
called
the
_
Alicia
_
,
and
was
a
member
of
the
Cork
Yacht
Club
.
<EOS>
He
lived
in
London
,
he
told
me
,
but
gave
me
no
information
as
to
his
profession
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
the
law
,
as
I
had
surmised
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
seen
our
ass
of
a
captain
,
Mr.
Gregg
?
<EOS>
"
he
remarked
presently
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
rather
hesitatingly
,
"
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
think
very
much
of
his
seamanship
--
nor
will
the
Board
of
Trade
when
his
report
reaches
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Hornby
,
"
I
was
a
fool
to
engage
him
.
<EOS>
From
the
very
first
I
mistrusted
him
,
only
my
wife
somehow
took
a
fancy
to
the
fellow
,
and
,
as
you
know
,
if
you
want
peace
you
must
always
please
the
women
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
however
,
her
choice
almost
cost
me
the
vessel
,
and
perhaps
our
lives
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
knew
nothing
of
him
previously
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
engaged
the
crew
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
they
all
fresh
hands
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
except
the
cook
and
the
two
stewards
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
silent
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
entertained
a
distinct
suspicion
of
both
master
and
crew
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
captain
seems
to
have
had
a
nasty
cut
across
the
cheek
,
"
I
remarked
,
whereupon
my
two
companions
again
exchanged
quick
,
apprehensive
glances
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
fell
down
the
other
day
,
"
explained
Chater
,
with
a
rather
sickly
smile
,
I
thought
.
<EOS>
"
His
face
caught
the
edge
of
an
iron
stair
in
the
engine
-
room
,
and
caused
a
nasty
gash
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
smiled
within
myself
,
for
I
knew
too
well
that
the
ugly
wound
in
the
captain
's
face
had
never
been
inflicted
by
falling
on
the
edge
of
a
stair
.
<EOS>
But
I
remained
silent
,
being
content
that
they
should
endeavor
to
mislead
me
.
 
<EOS>
After
dessert
had
been
served
we
rose
,
and
in
the
summer
twilight
,
when
all
the
ports
were
opened
,
Hornby
took
me
over
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
was
abundant
luxury
--
a
veritable
floating
palace
.
<EOS>
To
each
of
the
cabins
of
the
owner
and
his
guests
a
bathroom
was
attached
with
sea
-
water
or
fresh
water
as
desired
,
while
the
ladies
'
saloon
,
the
boudoir
,
the
library
,
and
the
smoking
-
room
were
furnished
richly
with
exquisite
taste
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
conducting
me
from
his
own
cabin
to
the
boudoir
we
passed
a
door
that
had
been
blown
open
by
the
wind
,
and
which
he
hastened
to
close
,
not
,
however
,
before
I
had
time
to
glance
within
.
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
I
discovered
that
it
was
an
armory
crammed
with
rifles
,
revolvers
and
ammunition
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
intended
that
I
should
see
that
interior
,
and
the
reason
why
the
Customs
officers
had
been
bribed
was
now
apparent
.
 
<EOS>
I
passed
on
without
remark
,
making
believe
that
I
had
not
discerned
anything
unusual
,
and
we
entered
the
boudoir
,
Chater
having
gone
back
to
the
saloon
to
obtain
cigars
.
 
<EOS>
The
dainty
little
chamber
was
upholstered
in
carnation
-
pink
silk
with
furniture
of
inlaid
rosewood
,
and
bore
everywhere
the
trace
of
having
been
arranged
by
a
woman
's
hand
,
although
no
lady
passenger
was
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
we
had
entered
,
and
I
was
admiring
the
dainty
nest
of
luxury
<EOS>
,
Chater
shouted
to
his
host
asking
for
the
keys
of
the
cigar
cupboard
,
and
Hornby
,
excusing
himself
,
turned
back
along
the
gangway
to
hand
them
to
his
friend
,
thus
leaving
me
alone
for
a
few
moments
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
glancing
around
,
and
as
I
did
so
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
quantity
of
photographs
,
framed
and
unframed
,
that
were
scattered
about
--
<EOS>
evidently
portraits
of
Hornby
's
friends
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
small
side
table
,
however
,
stood
a
heavy
oxidized
silver
frame
,
but
empty
,
while
lying
on
the
floor
beneath
a
couch
was
the
photograph
it
had
contained
,
which
had
apparently
been
taken
hastily
out
,
torn
first
in
half
and
then
in
half
again
,
and
cast
away
.
 
<EOS>
Curiosity
prompted
me
to
stoop
,
pick
up
the
four
pieces
and
place
them
together
,
when
I
found
them
to
form
the
cabinet
portrait
of
a
sweet
-
looking
and
extremely
pretty
English
girl
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
,
with
a
bright
,
smiling
expression
,
and
wearing
a
fresh
morning
blouse
of
white
pique
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
dressed
low
and
fastened
with
a
bow
of
black
ribbon
,
while
the
brooch
at
her
throat
was
in
the
form
of
a
heart
edged
with
pearls
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
her
sweet
expression
,
or
whether
the
curious
look
in
her
eyes
had
attracted
my
attention
and
riveted
the
face
upon
my
memory
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
the
mystery
of
why
it
should
have
been
so
hastily
torn
from
its
frame
and
destroyed
that
held
my
attention
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
it
had
been
torn
up
surreptitiously
by
someone
who
had
been
sitting
on
that
couch
,
and
who
had
had
no
opportunity
of
casting
the
fragments
away
through
the
port
-
hole
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
back
of
the
torn
photograph
,
and
saw
that
it
had
been
taken
by
a
well
-
known
and
fashionable
firm
in
New
Bond
Street
.
 
<EOS>
About
the
expression
of
that
pictured
face
was
something
which
I
can
not
describe
--
a
curious
look
in
the
eyes
which
was
at
the
same
time
both
attractive
and
mysterious
.
<EOS>
In
that
brief
moment
the
girl
's
features
were
indelibly
impressed
upon
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
Next
second
,
however
,
hearing
Hornby
's
returning
footsteps
,
I
flung
the
fragments
hastily
beneath
the
couch
where
I
had
discovered
them
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
wondered
,
had
the
picture
been
destroyed
--
and
by
whom
?
 
<EOS>
The
face
of
the
empty
frame
had
been
purposely
turned
towards
the
panelling
,
therefore
when
he
entered
he
did
not
notice
that
the
picture
had
been
destroyed
;
but
after
a
brief
pause
,
explaining
that
that
cosy
little
place
was
his
wife
's
particular
nook
,
he
conducted
me
on
through
the
ladies
'
saloon
and
afterwards
on
deck
,
where
we
flung
ourselves
into
the
long
chairs
,
took
our
coffee
and
certosina
,
that
liqueur
essentially
Tuscan
,
and
smoked
on
as
the
moon
rose
and
the
lights
of
the
harbor
began
to
twinkle
in
the
steely
night
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
sat
talking
,
my
thoughts
ran
back
to
that
torn
photograph
.
<EOS>
To
me
it
seemed
as
though
some
previous
visitor
that
day
had
sat
upon
the
couch
,
destroyed
the
picture
,
and
cast
it
where
I
had
found
it
.
<EOS>
But
for
what
reason
?
<EOS>
Who
was
the
merry
-
faced
girl
whose
picture
had
aroused
such
jealousy
or
revenge
?
 
<EOS>
I
purposely
led
the
conversation
to
Hornby
's
family
,
and
learned
from
him
that
he
had
no
children
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
get
the
repairs
to
your
engines
done
at
Orlando
's
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
,
naming
the
great
shipbuilding
firm
of
Leghorn
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
've
already
given
the
order
.
<EOS>
They
are
contracted
to
be
finished
by
next
Thursday
,
and
then
we
shall
be
off
to
Zante
and
Chio
.
"
 
<EOS>
For
what
reason
,
I
wondered
,
recollecting
that
formidable
armory
on
board
.
<EOS>
Already
I
had
seen
quite
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
the
_
Lola
_
,
although
outwardly
a
pleasure
yacht
,
was
built
of
steel
,
armored
in
its
most
vulnerable
parts
,
and
capable
of
resisting
a
very
sharp
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
hours
passed
,
and
beneath
the
brilliant
moon
we
smoked
long
into
the
night
,
for
after
the
blazing
sunshine
of
that
Tuscan
town
the
cool
sea
-
wind
at
night
is
very
refreshing
.
<EOS>
From
where
we
sat
we
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
of
the
sea
-
front
of
Leghorn
and
Ardenza
,
with
its
bright
open
-
air
cafe
-
concerts
and
restaurants
in
full
swing
--
all
the
life
and
gayety
of
that
popular
watering
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
when
Hornby
had
risen
to
call
a
steward
and
left
me
alone
with
Hylton
Chater
,
the
latter
whispered
to
me
in
confidence--
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
find
my
friend
Hornby
a
little
bit
strange
in
his
manner
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
you
must
take
no
notice
.
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
,
he
is
a
man
who
has
become
suddenly
wealthy
beyond
the
wildest
dreams
of
avarice
,
and
I
fear
it
has
had
an
effect
upon
his
brain
.
<EOS>
He
does
very
queer
things
at
times
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
looked
at
my
companion
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
He
was
either
telling
the
truth
,
or
else
he
was
endeavoring
to
allay
my
suspicions
by
an
extremely
clever
ruse
.
<EOS>
Now
I
had
already
decided
that
Philip
Hornby
was
no
eccentric
,
but
a
particularly
level
-
headed
and
practical
man
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
instantly
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
clean
-
shaven
fellow
who
looked
so
much
like
a
London
barrister
had
some
distinct
and
ulterior
purpose
in
arousing
within
my
mind
suspicion
of
his
host
's
sanity
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
past
midnight
when
,
having
bade
the
strange
pair
adieu
,
I
was
put
ashore
by
the
two
sailors
who
had
rowed
me
out
and
drove
home
along
the
sea
-
front
,
puzzled
and
perplexed
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
on
my
arrival
at
the
Consulate
,
old
Francesco
,
who
had
entered
only
a
moment
before
,
met
me
with
blanched
face
,
gasping--
 
<EOS>
"
There
have
been
thieves
here
in
the
night
,
signore
!
<EOS>
The
Signor
Console
's
safe
has
been
opened
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
safe
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
cried
,
dashing
into
Hutcheson
's
private
room
,
and
finding
to
my
dismay
the
big
safe
,
wherein
the
seals
,
ciphers
and
other
confidential
documents
were
kept
,
standing
open
,
and
the
contents
in
disorder
,
as
though
a
hasty
search
had
been
made
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
the
thieves
had
been
after
the
Admiralty
and
Foreign
Office
ciphers
,
copies
of
which
the
Chancelleries
of
certain
European
Powers
were
ever
endeavoring
to
obtain
?
<EOS>
I
smiled
within
myself
when
I
realized
how
bitterly
disappointed
the
burglars
must
have
been
,
for
a
British
Consul
when
he
goes
on
leave
to
England
<EOS>
always
takes
his
ciphers
with
him
,
and
deposits
them
at
the
Foreign
Office
for
safekeeping
.
<EOS>
Hutcheson
had
,
of
course
,
taken
his
,
according
to
the
regulations
.
 
<EOS>
Curiously
enough
,
however
,
the
door
of
the
Consulate
and
the
safe
had
been
opened
with
the
keys
which
my
friend
had
left
in
my
charge
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
small
bunch
still
remained
in
the
safe
door
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
recollection
flashed
across
my
mind
that
I
had
felt
the
keys
in
my
pocket
while
at
dinner
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
Had
I
lost
them
on
my
homeward
drive
,
or
had
my
pocket
been
picked
?
 
<EOS>
Carducci
,
with
an
Italian
's
volubility
,
commenced
to
hurl
imprecations
upon
the
heads
of
the
unknown
sons
of
dogs
who
dared
to
tamper
with
his
master
's
safe
,
and
while
we
were
engaged
in
putting
the
scattered
papers
in
order
the
door
-
bell
rang
,
and
the
clerk
went
to
attend
to
the
caller
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
he
returned
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
The
English
yacht
left
suddenly
last
night
,
signore
,
and
the
Captain
of
the
Port
has
sent
to
inquire
whether
you
know
to
what
port
she
is
bound
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Left
!
"
<EOS>
I
gasped
in
amazement
"
<EOS>
Why
,
I
thought
her
engines
were
disabled
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
I
was
sitting
in
the
private
office
of
the
shrewd
,
gray
-
haired
functionary
who
had
sent
this
messenger
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Signor
Commendatore
,
"
he
said
,
"
some
mystery
surrounds
that
vessel
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
the
_
Lola
_
<EOS>
,
for
yesterday
we
telegraphed
to
Lloyd
's
,
in
London
,
and
this
morning
I
received
a
reply
that
no
such
yacht
appears
on
their
register
,
and
that
the
name
is
unknown
.
<EOS>
The
police
have
also
telegraphed
to
your
English
police
inquiring
about
the
owner
,
Signor
Hornby
,
with
a
like
result
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
such
place
as
Woodcroft
Park
,
in
Somerset
,
and
no
member
of
Brook
's
Club
of
the
name
of
Hornby
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
sat
staring
at
the
official
,
too
amazed
to
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
Certainly
they
had
not
allowed
the
grass
to
grow
beneath
their
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Unfortunately
the
telegraphic
replies
from
England
are
only
to
hand
this
morning
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
because
just
before
two
o'clock
this
morning
the
harbor
police
,
whom
I
specially
ordered
to
watch
the
vessel
,
saw
a
boat
come
to
the
wharf
containing
a
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
The
pair
were
put
ashore
,
and
walked
away
into
the
town
,
the
woman
seeming
to
walk
with
considerable
difficulty
.
<EOS>
The
boat
returned
,
and
an
hour
after
,
to
the
complete
surprise
of
the
two
detectives
,
steam
was
suddenly
got
up
and
the
yacht
turned
and
went
straight
out
to
sea
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leaving
the
man
and
the
woman
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leaving
them
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
They
are
probably
still
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
police
are
now
searching
for
traces
of
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
could
not
you
have
detained
the
vessel
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
had
I
but
known
<EOS>
I
could
have
forbidden
her
departure
.
<EOS>
But
as
her
owner
had
presented
himself
at
the
Consulate
,
and
was
recognized
as
a
respectable
person
,
I
felt
that
I
could
not
interfere
without
some
tangible
information
--
and
that
,
alas
!
<EOS>
has
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
vessel
is
a
swift
one
,
and
has
already
seven
hours
start
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
've
asked
the
Admiral
to
send
out
a
couple
of
torpedo
-
boats
after
her
,
but
,
unfortunately
,
this
is
impossible
,
as
the
flotilla
is
sailing
in
an
hour
to
attend
the
naval
review
at
Spezia
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
how
the
Consul
's
safe
had
been
opened
during
the
night
,
and
he
sat
listening
with
wide
-
open
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
dined
with
them
last
night
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
They
may
have
surreptitiously
stolen
your
keys
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
may
,
"
was
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Probably
they
did
.
<EOS>
But
with
what
motive
?
"
 
The
Captain
of
the
Port
elevated
his
shoulders
,
exhibited
his
palms
,
and
declared--
 
<EOS>
"
The
whole
affair
from
beginning
to
end
is
a
complete
and
profound
mystery
.
"
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
II
 
<EOS>
WHY
THE
SAFE
WAS
OPENED
  
<EOS>
That
day
was
an
active
one
in
Questura
,
or
police
office
,
of
Leghorn
.
 
<EOS>
Detectives
called
,
examined
the
safe
,
and
sagely
declared
it
to
be
burglar
-
proof
,
had
not
the
thieves
possessed
the
key
.
<EOS>
The
Foreign
Office
knew
that
,
for
they
supply
all
the
safes
to
the
Consulates
abroad
,
in
order
that
the
precious
ciphers
shall
be
kept
from
the
prying
eyes
of
foreign
spies
.
<EOS>
The
Questore
,
or
chief
of
police
,
was
of
opinion
that
it
was
the
ciphers
of
which
the
thieves
had
been
in
search
,
and
was
much
relieved
to
hear
that
they
were
in
safekeeping
far
away
in
Downing
Street
.
 
<EOS>
His
conjecture
was
the
same
as
my
own
,
namely
,
that
the
reason
of
Hornby
's
call
upon
me
was
to
ascertain
the
situation
of
the
Consulate
and
the
whereabouts
of
the
safe
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
Consul
's
private
room
.
<EOS>
Captain
Mackintosh
,
too
,
had
taken
his
bearings
,
and
probably
while
I
sat
at
dinner
on
board
<EOS>
the
_
Lola
_
<EOS>
my
keys
had
been
stolen
and
passed
on
to
the
scarred
Scotsman
,
who
had
promptly
gone
ashore
and
ransacked
the
place
while
I
had
remained
with
his
master
smoking
and
unsuspicious
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
was
the
motive
?
<EOS>
Why
had
they
ransacked
all
those
confidential
papers
?
 
<EOS>
My
own
idea
was
that
they
were
not
in
search
of
the
ciphers
at
all
,
but
either
wanted
some
blank
form
or
other
,
or
else
they
desired
to
make
use
of
the
Consular
seal
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
however
,
still
remained
on
the
floor
near
the
safe
,
as
though
it
had
rolled
out
and
been
left
unheeded
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
Francesco
and
I
could
ascertain
,
nothing
whatever
had
been
taken
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
we
re
-
arranged
the
papers
,
re
-
locked
the
safe
and
resolved
not
to
telegraph
to
Hutcheson
and
unduly
disturb
him
,
as
in
a
few
days
he
would
return
from
England
,
and
there
would
be
time
enough
then
to
explain
the
remarkable
story
.
 
<EOS>
One
fact
,
however
,
we
established
.
<EOS>
The
detective
on
duty
at
the
railway
station
distinctly
recollected
a
thin
middle
-
aged
man
,
accompanied
by
a
lady
in
deep
black
,
passing
the
barrier
and
entering
the
train
which
left
at
three
o'clock
for
Colle
Salvetti
to
join
the
Rome
express
.
<EOS>
They
were
foreigners
,
therefore
he
did
not
take
the
same
notice
of
them
as
though
they
had
been
Italians
.
<EOS>
Inquiries
at
the
booking
-
office
showed
,
however
,
that
no
passengers
had
booked
direct
to
Rome
by
the
train
in
question
.
<EOS>
To
Grossetto
,
Cecina
,
Campiglia
,
and
the
other
places
in
the
Maremma
,
passengers
had
taken
tickets
,
but
not
one
had
been
booked
to
any
of
the
great
towns
.
<EOS>
Therefore
it
was
apparent
that
the
mysterious
pair
who
had
come
ashore
just
prior
to
the
sailing
of
the
yacht
had
merely
taken
tickets
for
a
false
destination
,
and
had
re
-
booked
at
Colle
Salvetti
,
the
junction
with
that
long
main
line
which
connects
Genoa
with
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
The
police
were
puzzled
.
<EOS>
The
two
fishermen
who
sighted
the
_
Lola
_
and
first
gave
the
alarm
of
her
danger
,
declared
that
when
they
drew
alongside
and
proffered
assistance
the
captain
threatened
to
shoot
the
first
man
who
came
aboard
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
English
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
the
sturdy
,
brown
-
faced
toilers
of
the
sea
,
grinning
knowingly
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
English
,
when
they
drink
their
cognac
,
know
not
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
get
any
reward
for
returning
to
harbor
and
reporting
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Reward
!
"
echoed
one
of
the
men
,
the
elder
of
the
pair
.
<EOS>
"
Not
a
soldo
!
<EOS>
The
English
only
cursed
us
for
interfering
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
we
believed
that
they
were
trying
to
make
away
with
the
vessel
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
description
of
the
_
Lola
_
,
its
owner
,
his
guest
,
and
the
captain
were
circulated
by
the
police
to
all
the
Mediterranean
ports
,
with
a
request
that
the
yacht
should
be
detained
.
<EOS>
Yet
if
the
vessel
were
really
one
of
mystery
,
as
it
seemed
to
be
,
its
owner
would
no
doubt
go
across
to
some
quiet
anchorage
on
the
Algerian
coast
out
of
the
track
of
the
vessels
,
and
calmly
proceed
to
repaint
,
rename
and
disguise
his
craft
so
that
it
would
not
be
recognized
in
Marseilles
,
Naples
,
Smyrna
,
or
any
of
the
ports
where
private
yachts
habitually
call
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
from
the
very
first
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
Hornby
and
his
friends
had
very
cleverly
tricked
me
for
some
mysterious
purpose
,
and
afterwards
ingeniously
evaded
their
watchers
and
got
clean
away
.
 
<EOS>
Had
the
Italian
Admiral
been
able
to
send
a
torpedo
-
boat
or
two
after
the
fugitives
they
would
no
doubt
soon
have
been
overhauled
,
yet
circumstances
had
prevented
this
and
<EOS>
the
_
Lola
_
had
consequently
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
For
purposes
of
their
own
the
police
kept
the
affair
out
of
the
papers
,
and
when
Frank
Hutcheson
stepped
out
of
the
sleeping
-
car
from
Paris
on
to
the
platform
at
Pisa
a
few
nights
afterwards
,
I
related
to
him
the
extraordinary
story
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
scoundrels
wanted
these
,
that
's
evident
,
"
he
responded
,
holding
up
the
small
,
strong
,
leather
hand
-
bag
he
was
carrying
,
and
which
contained
his
jealously
-
guarded
ciphers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
Jove
!
"
he
laughed
,
"
how
disappointed
they
must
have
been
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
"
I
said
,
as
we
entered
the
midnight
train
for
Leghorn
.
<EOS>
"
But
my
own
theory
is
that
they
were
searching
for
some
paper
or
other
that
you
possess
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
my
papers
concern
them
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
jovial
,
round
-
faced
Consul
,
a
man
whose
courtesy
is
known
to
every
skipper
trading
up
and
down
the
Mediterranean
,
and
who
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
cultured
and
popular
men
in
the
British
Consular
Service
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
keep
bank
notes
in
that
safe
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
We
fellows
in
the
Service
do
n't
roll
in
gold
as
our
public
at
home
appears
to
think
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
But
you
may
have
something
in
there
which
might
be
of
value
to
them
.
<EOS>
You
're
often
the
keeper
of
valuable
documents
belonging
to
Englishmen
abroad
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
nothing
in
there
just
now
except
,
perhaps
,
the
registers
of
births
,
marriages
and
deaths
of
British
subjects
,
and
the
papers
concerning
a
Board
of
Trade
inquiry
.
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
Gordon
,
depend
upon
it
that
the
yacht
running
ashore
was
all
a
blind
.
<EOS>
They
did
it
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
the
run
of
the
Consulate
,
secure
the
ciphers
,
and
sail
merrily
away
with
them
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
,
however
,
that
they
gave
you
a
jolly
good
dinner
and
got
nothing
in
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
might
very
easily
have
carried
me
off
too
,
"
I
declared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
they
had
.
<EOS>
You
'd
at
least
have
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
what
their
little
game
really
was
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
man
and
the
woman
who
left
the
yacht
an
hour
before
she
sailed
,
and
who
slipped
away
into
the
country
somewhere
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
who
they
were
?
<EOS>
Hornby
distinctly
told
me
that
he
and
Chater
were
alone
,
and
yet
there
was
evidently
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
on
board
.
<EOS>
I
guessed
there
was
a
woman
there
,
from
the
way
the
boudoir
and
ladies
'
saloon
were
arranged
,
and
certainly
no
man
's
hand
decorated
a
dinner
table
as
that
was
decorated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
That
's
decidedly
funny
,
"
remarked
the
Consul
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
They
went
to
Colle
Salvetti
,
you
say
?
<EOS>
They
changed
there
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Expresses
call
there
,
one
going
north
and
the
other
south
,
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
train
arrives
from
Leghorn
.
<EOS>
They
showed
a
lot
of
ingenuity
,
otherwise
they
'd
have
gone
direct
to
Pisa
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ingenuity
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
so
!
<EOS>
The
whole
affair
was
most
cleverly
planned
.
<EOS>
Hornby
would
have
deceived
even
you
,
my
dear
old
chap
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
air
of
the
perfect
gentleman
,
and
a
glance
over
the
yacht
convinced
me
that
he
was
a
wealthy
man
traveling
for
pleasure
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
said
something
about
an
armory
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
were
<EOS>
Maxims
stowed
away
in
one
of
the
cabins
.
<EOS>
They
aroused
my
suspicions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
would
not
have
aroused
mine
,
"
replied
my
friend
.
"
<EOS>
Yachts
carry
arms
for
protection
in
many
cases
,
especially
if
they
are
going
to
cruise
along
uncivilized
coasts
where
they
must
land
for
water
or
provisions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
of
the
torn
photograph
,
which
caused
him
some
deep
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
why
the
picture
had
been
torn
up
.
<EOS>
Had
there
been
a
row
on
board
--
a
quarrel
or
something
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
had
been
destroyed
surreptitiously
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pity
you
did
n't
pocket
the
fragments
.
<EOS>
We
could
perhaps
have
discovered
from
the
photographer
the
identity
of
the
original
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
sighed
regretfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
the
name
of
the
firm
,
however
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
report
to
London
the
whole
occurrence
,
as
British
subjects
are
under
suspicion
,
"
Hutcheson
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
whether
Scotland
Yard
knows
anything
about
Hornby
or
Chater
.
<EOS>
Most
probably
they
do
.
<EOS>
Not
long
ago
a
description
of
men
on
board
a
yacht
was
circulated
from
London
as
being
a
pair
of
well
-
known
burglars
who
were
cruising
about
in
a
vessel
crammed
with
booty
which
they
dared
not
get
rid
of
.
<EOS>
They
are
,
however
,
not
the
same
as
our
friends
on
the
_
Lola
_
,
for
both
men
wanted
were
arrested
in
New
Orleans
about
eight
months
ago
,
without
their
yacht
,
for
they
confessed
that
they
had
deliberately
sunk
it
on
one
of
the
islands
in
the
South
Pacific
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
these
fellows
might
be
another
pair
of
London
burglars
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
eagerly
,
as
the
startling
theory
occurred
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
might
be
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
we
ca
n't
form
any
opinion
until
we
hear
what
Scotland
Yard
has
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
'll
write
a
full
report
in
the
morning
if
you
will
give
me
minute
descriptions
of
the
men
,
as
well
as
of
the
captain
,
Mackintosh
.
"
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
I
handed
over
my
charge
of
the
Consulate
to
Frank
,
and
then
assisted
him
to
go
through
the
papers
in
the
safe
which
had
been
examined
by
the
thieves
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
ruffians
seem
to
have
thoroughly
overhauled
everything
,
"
remarked
the
Consul
in
dismay
when
he
saw
the
disordered
state
of
his
papers
.
<EOS>
"
They
seem
to
have
read
every
one
deliberately
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Which
shows
that
had
they
been
in
search
for
the
cipher
-
books
they
would
only
have
looked
for
them
alone
,
"
I
remarked
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
could
interest
them
in
all
these
dry
,
unimportant
shipping
reports
and
things
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Goodness
only
knows
,
"
replied
my
friend
.
<EOS>
Then
,
calling
Cavendish
,
a
tall
,
fair
young
man
,
who
had
now
recovered
from
his
touch
of
fever
and
had
returned
to
the
Consulate
,
he
commenced
to
check
the
number
of
those
adhesive
stamps
,
rather
larger
than
ordinary
postage
-
stamps
,
used
in
the
Consular
service
for
the
registration
of
fees
received
by
the
Foreign
Office
.
<EOS>
The
values
were
from
sixpence
to
one
pound
,
and
they
were
kept
in
a
portfolio
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
long
calculation
the
Consul
suddenly
raised
his
face
to
me
and
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Then
six
ten
shilling
ones
have
been
taken
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
There
must
be
some
motive
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
of
no
use
to
anyone
except
to
Consuls
,
"
he
explained
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
were
wanted
to
affix
to
some
false
certificate
.
<EOS>
See
,
"
he
added
,
opening
the
portfolio
,
"
there
were
six
stamps
here
,
and
all
are
gone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
they
would
have
to
be
obliterated
by
the
Consular
stamp
,
"
remarked
Cavendish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
of
course
,
"
exclaimed
Hutcheson
,
taking
out
the
brass
seal
from
the
safe
and
examining
it
minutely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
Jove
!
"
he
cried
a
second
later
,
"
it
's
been
used
!
<EOS>
They
've
stamped
some
document
with
it
.
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
They
've
used
the
wrong
ink
-
pad
!
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
see
that
there
's
violet
upon
it
,
while
we
always
use
the
black
pad
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
took
it
in
my
hand
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
I
saw
traces
of
violet
ink
upon
it
--
the
ink
of
the
pad
for
the
date
-
stamp
upon
the
Consul
's
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
some
document
has
been
stamped
and
sealed
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
And
my
signature
forged
to
it
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
They
've
fabricated
some
certificate
or
other
which
,
bearing
the
stamp
,
seal
and
signature
of
the
Consulate
,
will
be
accepted
as
a
legal
document
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
it
is
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
three
of
us
looked
at
each
other
in
sheer
bewilderment
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
reason
the
papers
are
all
upset
is
because
they
were
evidently
in
search
of
some
blank
form
or
other
,
which
they
hoped
to
find
,
"
remarked
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
say
,
the
whole
affair
was
most
carefully
and
ingeniously
planned
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
crossed
the
great
sunlit
piazza
together
and
entered
the
Questura
,
that
sun
-
blanched
old
palace
with
its
long
cool
loggia
where
the
sentry
paces
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
The
Chief
of
Police
,
whom
we
saw
,
had
no
further
information
.
<EOS>
The
mysterious
yacht
had
not
put
in
at
any
Italian
port
.
<EOS>
From
him
,
however
,
we
learned
the
name
of
the
detective
who
had
seen
the
two
strangers
leave
Leghorn
by
the
early
morning
train
,
and
an
hour
afterwards
the
police
-
officer
,
a
black
-
eyed
man
short
of
stature
,
but
of
an
intelligent
type
,
sat
in
the
Consulate
replying
to
our
questions
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
could
make
out
,
signore
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
man
was
an
Englishman
,
wearing
a
soft
black
felt
hat
and
a
suit
of
dark
blue
serge
.
<EOS>
He
had
hair
just
turning
gray
,
a
small
dark
mustache
and
rather
high
cheek
-
bones
.
<EOS>
In
his
hand
he
carried
a
small
bag
of
tan
leather
of
that
square
English
shape
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
in
no
hurry
,
for
he
was
calmly
smoking
a
cigarette
as
he
went
across
to
the
ticket
office
.
"
 
"
<EOS>
And
his
companion
?
"
asked
the
Consul
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
in
black
.
<EOS>
Rather
tall
and
slim
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
fair
,
I
noticed
,
but
she
wore
a
black
veil
which
concealed
her
features
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Was
she
young
or
old
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Young
--
from
her
figure
,
"
replied
the
police
agent
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
passed
me
her
eyes
met
mine
,
and
I
thought
I
saw
a
strange
fixed
kind
of
glare
in
them
--
the
look
of
a
woman
filled
with
some
unspeakable
horror
.
"
 
<EOS>
Next
day
the
town
of
Leghorn
awoke
to
find
itself
gay
with
bunting
,
the
Italian
and
English
flags
flying
side
by
side
everywhere
,
and
the
Consular
standard
flapping
over
the
Consulate
in
the
piazza
.
<EOS>
In
the
night
the
British
Mediterranean
fleet
,
cruising
down
from
Malta
,
had
come
into
the
roadstead
,
and
at
the
signal
from
the
flagship
had
maneuvered
and
dropped
anchor
,
forming
a
long
line
of
gigantic
battleships
,
swift
cruisers
,
torpedo
-
boat
destroyers
,
torpedo
-
boats
,
despatch
-
boats
,
and
other
craft
extending
for
several
miles
along
the
coast
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
bright
morning
sunlight
the
sight
was
both
picturesque
and
imposing
,
for
from
every
vessel
flags
were
flying
,
and
ever
and
anon
the
great
battleship
of
the
Admiral
made
signals
which
were
repeated
by
all
the
other
vessels
,
each
in
turn
.
<EOS>
Lying
still
on
those
calm
blue
waters
was
a
force
which
one
day
might
cause
nations
to
totter
,
the
overwhelming
force
which
upheld
Britain
's
right
in
that
oft
-
disputed
sea
.
 
<EOS>
A
couple
of
thousand
British
sailors
were
ashore
on
leave
,
their
white
caps
conspicuous
in
the
streets
everywhere
as
they
walked
orderly
in
threes
and
fours
to
inspect
the
town
.
<EOS>
In
the
square
outside
the
Consulate
a
squad
from
the
flagship
were
setting
up
a
temporary
band
-
stand
,
where
the
ship
's
band
was
to
play
when
evening
fell
,
while
Hutcheson
,
perspiring
in
his
uniform
,
drove
with
the
Admiral
to
make
the
calls
of
courtesy
upon
the
authorities
which
international
etiquette
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
Myself
,
I
had
taken
a
boat
out
to
the
_
Bulwark
_
,
the
great
battleship
flying
the
Admiral
's
flag
,
and
was
sitting
on
deck
with
my
old
friend
Captain
Jack
Durnford
,
of
the
Royal
Marines
.
<EOS>
Each
year
when
the
fleet
put
into
Leghorn
we
were
inseparable
,
for
in
long
years
past
,
at
Portsmouth
,
we
had
been
close
friends
,
and
now
he
was
able
to
pay
me
annual
visits
at
my
Italian
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
duty
that
morning
,
therefore
could
not
get
ashore
till
after
luncheon
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
dine
with
you
,
of
course
,
to
-
night
,
old
chap
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
must
tell
me
all
the
news
.
<EOS>
We
're
in
here
for
six
days
,
and
I
was
half
a
mind
to
run
home
.
<EOS>
Two
of
our
chaps
got
leave
from
the
Admiral
and
left
at
three
this
morning
for
London
--
four
days
in
the
train
and
two
in
town
!
<EOS>
Gone
to
see
their
sweethearts
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
The
British
naval
officer
in
the
Mediterranean
delights
to
dash
across
Europe
for
a
day
at
home
if
he
can
get
leave
and
funds
will
allow
.
<EOS>
It
is
generally
reckoned
that
such
a
trip
costs
about
two
pounds
an
hour
while
in
London
.
<EOS>
And
yet
when
a
man
is
away
from
his
_
fiancee
_
or
wife
for
three
whole
years
,
his
anxiety
to
get
back
,
even
for
a
brief
day
,
is
easily
understood
.
<EOS>
The
youngsters
,
however
,
go
for
mere
caprice
--
whenever
they
can
obtain
leave
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
often
,
for
the
Admiral
has
very
fixed
views
upon
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
time
's
soon
up
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
,
as
I
lolled
back
in
the
easy
deck
-
chair
,
and
gazed
away
at
the
white
port
and
its
background
of
purple
Apennines
.
 
<EOS>
The
dark
,
good
-
looking
fellow
in
his
smart
summer
uniform
leaned
over
the
bulwark
,
and
said
,
with
a
slight
sigh
,
I
<EOS>
thought--
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
last
trip
to
Leghorn
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
go
back
in
November
,
and
I
really
sha
n't
be
sorry
.
<EOS>
Three
years
is
a
long
time
to
be
away
from
home
.
<EOS>
You
go
next
week
,
you
say
?
<EOS>
Lucky
devil
to
be
your
own
master
!
<EOS>
I
only
wish
I
were
.
<EOS>
Year
after
year
on
this
deck
grows
confoundedly
wearisome
,
I
can
tell
you
,
my
dear
fellow
.
"
 
<EOS>
Durnford
was
a
man
who
had
written
much
on
naval
affairs
,
and
was
accepted
as
an
expert
on
several
branches
of
the
service
.
<EOS>
The
Admiralty
do
not
encourage
officers
to
write
,
but
in
Durnford
's
case
it
was
recognized
that
of
naval
topics
he
possessed
a
knowledge
that
was
of
use
,
and
,
therefore
,
he
was
allowed
to
write
books
and
to
contribute
critical
articles
to
the
service
magazines
.
<EOS>
He
had
studied
the
relative
strengths
of
foreign
navies
,
and
by
keeping
his
eyes
always
open
<EOS>
he
had
,
on
many
occasions
,
been
able
to
give
valuable
information
to
our
naval
_
<EOS>
attaches
_
at
the
Embassies
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
,
however
,
his
trenchant
criticism
of
the
action
of
the
naval
lords
had
brought
upon
his
head
rebukes
from
head
-
quarters
;
nevertheless
,
so
universally
was
his
talent
as
a
naval
expert
recognized
,
that
to
write
had
never
been
forbidden
him
as
it
had
been
to
certain
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
's
Hutcheson
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
a
moment
later
,
turning
and
facing
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fit
as
a
fiddle
.
<EOS>
Just
back
from
his
month
's
leave
at
home
.
<EOS>
His
wife
is
still
up
in
Scotland
,
however
.
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
stand
Leghorn
in
summer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
wonder
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
perfect
furnace
when
the
weather
begins
to
stoke
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
go
as
soon
as
you
've
sailed
.
<EOS>
I
only
stayed
because
I
promised
to
act
for
Frank
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
,
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
a
funny
thing
occurred
while
I
was
in
charge
--
a
real
first
-
class
mystery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
mystery
--
tell
me
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
suddenly
interested
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
a
yacht
--
a
pirate
yacht
,
I
believe
it
was
--
called
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
pirate
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
she
was
English
.
<EOS>
Listen
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
something
fresh
to
tell
at
mess
,
for
I
know
how
you
chaps
get
played
out
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
,
yes
!
<EOS>
Things
slump
when
we
get
no
mail
.
<EOS>
But
go
on
--
I'm
listening
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
as
an
orderly
came
up
,
saluted
,
and
handed
him
a
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
,
"
let
's
cross
to
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
the
sentry
to
overhear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
like
--
but
why
such
mystery
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
as
we
walked
together
to
the
other
side
of
the
spick
-
and
-
span
quarter
-
deck
of
the
gigantic
battleship
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
understand
when
I
tell
you
the
story
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
standing
together
beneath
the
awning
,
I
related
to
my
friend
the
whole
of
the
curious
circumstances
,
just
as
I
have
recorded
them
in
the
foregoing
pages
.
 
<EOS>
"
Confoundedly
funny
!
"
<EOS>
he
remarked
with
his
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
mine
.
"
<EOS>
A
mystery
,
by
Jove
,
it
is
!
<EOS>
What
name
did
the
yacht
bear
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
he
gasped
,
suddenly
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
_
Lola
_
?
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
sure
it
was
the
_
Lola_--_L
-
O
-
L
-
A
_
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Absolutely
certain
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
do
you
ask
?
<EOS>
Do
you
happen
to
know
anything
about
the
craft
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Me
!
"
<EOS>
he
stammered
,
and
I
could
see
that
he
had
involuntarily
betrayed
the
truth
,
yet
for
some
reason
he
wished
to
conceal
his
knowledge
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Me
!
<EOS>
How
should
I
know
anything
about
such
a
craft
?
<EOS>
They
were
thieves
on
board
evidently
--
perhaps
pirates
,
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
name
_
Lola
_
is
familiar
to
you
,
Jack
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
it
is
,
by
your
manner
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
,
and
I
could
see
what
a
strenuous
effort
he
was
making
to
avoid
betraying
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
"
It's
--
well--
<EOS>
"
he
said
hesitatingly
,
with
a
rather
sickly
smile
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
girl
's
name
--
a
girl
I
once
knew
.
<EOS>
The
name
brings
back
to
me
certain
memories
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pleasant
ones
--
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
Bitter
ones
--
very
bitter
ones
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
in
a
hard
tone
,
striding
across
the
deck
and
back
again
,
and
I
saw
in
his
eyes
a
strange
look
,
half
of
anger
,
half
of
deep
regret
.
 
<EOS>
Was
he
telling
the
truth
,
I
wondered
?
<EOS>
Some
tragic
romance
or
other
concerning
a
woman
had
,
I
knew
,
overshadowed
his
life
in
the
years
before
we
had
become
acquainted
.
<EOS>
But
the
real
facts
he
had
never
revealed
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
before
referred
to
the
bitterness
of
the
past
,
although
I
knew
full
well
that
his
heart
was
in
secret
filled
by
some
overwhelming
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
Outwardly
he
was
as
merry
as
the
other
fellows
who
officered
that
huge
floating
fortress
;
on
board
he
was
a
typical
smart
marine
,
and
on
shore
he
danced
and
played
tennis
and
flirted
just
as
vigorously
as
did
the
others
.
<EOS>
But
a
heavy
heart
beat
beneath
his
uniform
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
returned
to
where
I
stood
I
saw
that
his
face
had
changed
:
it
had
become
drawn
and
haggard
.
<EOS>
He
bore
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
had
been
struck
a
blow
that
had
staggered
him
,
crushing
out
all
life
and
hope
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Jack
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
Tell
me
--
what
ails
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
my
dear
old
chap
,
"
he
answered
hoarsely
.
"
<EOS>
Really
nothing
--
only
a
touch
of
the
blues
just
for
a
moment
,
"
he
added
,
trying
hard
to
smile
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
pass
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
I
've
just
told
you
about
that
yacht
has
upset
you
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
deny
it
"
 
<EOS>
He
started
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
was
,
I
saw
,
hard
set
.
<EOS>
He
knew
something
concerning
that
mysterious
craft
,
but
would
not
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
sound
of
a
bugle
came
from
the
further
end
of
the
ship
,
and
immediately
men
were
scampering
along
the
deck
beneath
as
some
order
or
other
was
being
obeyed
with
that
precision
that
characterizes
the
"
handy
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
silent
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
slowly
,
my
eyes
fixed
upon
my
friend
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
what
I
know
,
and
I
want
to
discover
the
motive
of
the
visit
of
those
men
,
and
the
reason
they
opened
Hutcheson
's
safe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
tell
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
in
a
strained
,
unnatural
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
know
something
concerning
them
.
<EOS>
Come
,
tell
me
the
truth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
admit
that
I
have
certain
grave
suspicions
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
standing
astride
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
<EOS>
,
his
sword
trailing
on
the
white
deck
.
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
the
yacht
was
called
the
_
Lola_--painted
gray
with
a
black
funnel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
dead
white
,
with
a
yellow
funnel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Of
course
,
"
he
remarked
,
as
though
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
repaint
and
alter
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
the
dining
saloon
.
<EOS>
Was
there
a
long
carved
oak
buffet
with
a
big
,
heavy
cornice
with
three
gilt
dolphins
in
the
center
--
and
were
there
not
dolphins
in
gilt
on
the
backs
of
the
chairs
--
an
armorial
device
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
<EOS>
I
remember
them
!
<EOS>
You
've
surely
been
on
board
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
is
a
ladies
'
saloon
and
a
small
boudoir
in
pink
beyond
,
while
the
smoking
-
room
is
entirely
of
marble
for
the
heat
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
--
the
same
yacht
,
no
doubt
!
<EOS>
But
what
do
you
know
of
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
captain
,
who
gave
his
name
to
you
as
Mackintosh
,
is
an
undersized
American
of
a
rather
low
-
down
type
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
took
him
for
a
Scotsman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
he
put
on
a
Scotch
accent
,
"
he
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
man
who
can
speak
a
dozen
languages
brokenly
,
and
pass
for
an
Italian
,
a
German
,
a
Frenchman
,
as
he
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
And
the
--
the
man
who
gave
his
name
as
Philip
Hornby
?
"
 
<EOS>
Durnford
's
mouth
closed
with
a
snap
.
<EOS>
He
drew
a
long
breath
,
his
eyes
grew
fierce
,
and
he
bit
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
he
is
not
exactly
your
friend
,
"
I
said
meaningly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Gordon
--
he
is
not
my
friend
,
"
was
his
slow
,
meaning
response
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
why
not
be
outspoken
and
tell
me
all
you
know
concerning
him
?
<EOS>
Frank
Hutcheson
is
anxious
to
clear
up
the
mystery
because
they
've
tampered
with
the
Consular
seals
and
things
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
would
be
put
down
to
his
credit
if
he
solved
the
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
'm
mystified
myself
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
yet
discern
their
motive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
at
any
rate
you
know
the
men
,
"
I
argued
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
at
least
tell
us
who
they
really
are
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
,
still
disinclined
,
for
some
hidden
reason
,
to
reveal
the
truth
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
saw
no
woman
on
board
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
suddenly
,
looking
straight
into
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
Hornby
told
me
that
he
and
Chater
were
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
an
hour
after
you
left
a
man
and
a
woman
came
ashore
and
disappeared
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
If
we
only
had
a
description
of
that
woman
it
would
reveal
much
to
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
young
and
dark
-
haired
,
so
the
detective
says
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
curious
fixed
look
in
her
eyes
which
attracted
him
,
but
she
wore
a
thick
motor
veil
,
so
that
he
could
not
clearly
discern
her
features
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
her
companion
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Middle
-
aged
,
prematurely
gray
,
with
a
small
dark
mustache
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
Durnford
sighed
and
stroked
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Just
as
I
thought
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
And
they
were
actually
here
,
in
this
port
,
a
week
ago
!
<EOS>
What
a
bitter
irony
of
fate
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
mysterious
,
and
yet
you
will
tell
me
nothing
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
police
,
fools
that
they
are
,
have
allowed
them
to
escape
,
and
they
will
never
be
caught
now
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
know
them
as
I
do
!
<EOS>
They
are
the
cleverest
pair
in
all
Europe
.
<EOS>
And
they
have
the
audacity
to
call
their
craft
the
_
Lola_--the
_
Lola
_
,
of
all
names
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
as
you
know
who
and
what
the
fellows
are
,
you
ought
,
I
think
,
in
common
justice
to
Hutcheson
,
to
tell
us
something
,
"
I
complained
.
<EOS>
"
If
they
are
adventurers
,
they
ought
to
be
traced
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
--
a
prisoner
here
on
board
?
"
<EOS>
he
argued
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
act
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
it
all
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
free
to
travel
after
them
,
and
find
out
the
truth
if
only
you
will
tell
me
what
you
know
concerning
them
,
"
I
said
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gordon
,
let
me
be
frank
and
open
with
you
,
my
dear
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
would
tell
you
everything
--
everything
--
if
I
dared
.
<EOS>
But
I
cannot
--
you
understand
!
"
<EOS>
And
his
final
words
seemed
to
choke
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
before
him
,
open
-
mouthed
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
really
mean
--
<EOS>
well
,
that
you
are
in
fear
of
them
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
I
whispered
.
 
<EOS>
He
nodded
slowly
in
the
affirmative
,
adding
:
"
To
tell
you
the
truth
would
be
to
bring
upon
myself
a
swift
,
relentless
vengeance
that
would
overwhelm
and
crush
me
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
fellow
,
you
do
not
know
--
<EOS>
you
can
not
dream
--
<EOS>
what
brought
those
desperate
men
into
this
port
.
<EOS>
I
can
guess
--
<EOS>
I
can
guess
only
too
well
--
but
I
can
only
tell
you
that
if
you
ever
do
discover
the
terrible
truth
--
which
I
fear
is
unlikely
--
you
will
solve
one
of
the
strangest
and
most
remarkable
mysteries
of
modern
times
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
the
mystery
concern
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
in
breathless
eagerness
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
concerns
a
woman
.

CHAPTER
III
 
<EOS>
THE
HOUSE
"
OVER
THE
WATER
"
  
<EOS>
The
Mediterranean
Squadron
,
that
magnificent
display
of
naval
force
that
is
the
guarantee
of
peace
in
Europe
,
after
a
week
of
gay
festivities
in
Leghorn
,
had
sailed
for
Gaeta
,
while
I
,
glad
to
escape
from
the
glaring
heat
,
found
myself
back
once
more
in
dear
old
London
.
 
<EOS>
One
passes
one
's
time
in
the
south
well
enough
in
winter
,
but
after
a
year
even
the
most
ardent
lover
of
Italy
longs
to
return
to
his
own
people
,
be
it
ever
for
so
brief
a
space
.
<EOS>
Exile
for
a
whole
year
in
any
continental
town
is
exile
indeed
;
therefore
,
although
I
lived
in
Italy
for
choice
,
I
,
like
so
many
other
Englishmen
,
always
managed
to
spend
a
month
or
two
in
summer
in
our
temperate
if
much
maligned
climate
.
 
<EOS>
London
,
the
same
dear
,
dusty
old
London
,
only
perhaps
more
dear
and
more
dusty
than
ever
,
was
my
native
city
;
hence
I
always
spent
a
few
weeks
in
it
,
even
though
all
the
world
might
be
absent
in
the
country
,
or
at
the
seaside
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
idled
away
a
pleasant
month
up
in
Buxton
,
and
from
there
had
gone
north
to
the
Lakes
,
and
it
was
one
hot
evening
in
mid
-
August
that
I
found
myself
again
in
London
,
crossing
St.
James
's
Square
from
the
Sports
Club
,
where
I
had
dined
,
walking
towards
Pall
Mall
.
<EOS>
Darkness
had
just
fallen
,
and
there
was
that
stifling
oppression
in
the
air
that
fore
-
tokened
a
thunderstorm
.
<EOS>
The
club
was
not
gay
with
life
and
merriment
as
it
is
in
the
season
,
for
everyone
was
away
,
many
of
the
rooms
were
closed
for
re
-
decoration
,
and
most
of
the
furniture
swathed
in
linen
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
on
my
way
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
lady
who
lived
up
at
Hampstead
,
a
friend
of
my
late
mother
's
,
and
had
just
turned
into
Pall
Mall
,
when
a
voice
at
my
elbow
suddenly
exclaimed
in
Italian--
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
signore!--why
,
actually
,
my
padrone
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
looking
round
,
I
saw
a
thin
-
faced
man
of
about
thirty
,
dressed
in
neat
but
rather
shabby
black
,
whom
I
instantly
recognized
as
a
man
who
had
been
my
servant
in
Leghorn
for
two
years
,
after
which
he
had
left
to
better
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Olinto
!
"
I
exclaimed
,
surprised
,
as
I
halted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
--
in
London
--
eh
?
<EOS>
Well
,
and
how
are
you
getting
on
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
excellently
,
signore
,
"
he
answered
in
broken
English
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
so
pleasant
for
me
to
see
my
generous
padrone
again
.
<EOS>
What
fortune
it
is
that
I
should
pass
here
at
this
very
moment
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
working
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
the
Restaurant
Milano
,
in
Oxford
Street
--
only
a
small
place
,
<EOS>
but
we
gain
discreetly
,
so
I
must
not
complain
.
<EOS>
I
live
over
in
Lambeth
,
and
am
on
my
way
home
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
heard
you
married
after
you
left
me
.
<EOS>
Is
that
true
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
signore
.
<EOS>
I
married
Armida
,
who
was
in
your
service
when
I
first
entered
it
.
<EOS>
You
remember
her
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
well
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
sighing
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
I
regret
to
say
she
is
very
ill
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
stand
your
English
climate
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
says
she
will
die
if
she
remains
here
.
<EOS>
Yet
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
If
we
go
back
to
Italy
we
shall
only
starve
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
saw
that
he
was
in
deep
distress
,
and
that
mention
of
his
ailing
wife
had
aroused
within
him
bitter
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
Olinto
Santini
walked
back
at
my
side
in
the
direction
of
Trafalgar
Square
,
answering
the
questions
I
put
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
good
,
hard
-
working
servant
,
and
I
was
glad
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
When
he
left
me
he
had
gone
as
steward
on
one
of
the
Anchor
Line
boats
between
Naples
and
New
York
,
and
that
was
the
last
I
had
heard
of
him
until
I
found
him
there
in
London
,
a
waiter
at
a
second
-
rate
restaurant
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
tried
to
slip
some
silver
into
his
hand
he
refused
to
take
it
,
and
with
a
merry
laugh
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
you
would
be
offended
,
signore
,
if
I
told
you
of
something
for
which
I
had
been
longing
and
longing
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
the
signore
smokes
our
Tuscan
cigars
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
by
chance
you
have
one
?
<EOS>
We
can
not
get
them
in
London
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
felt
in
my
pocket
,
laughing
,
and
discovered
that
I
had
a
couple
of
those
long
thin
penny
cigars
which
I
always
smoke
in
Italy
,
and
which
are
so
dear
to
the
Tuscan
palate
.
<EOS>
These
I
handed
him
,
and
he
took
them
with
delight
as
the
greatest
delicacy
I
could
have
offered
him
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
As
an
exiled
Italian
he
clung
to
every
little
trifle
that
reminded
him
of
his
own
beloved
country
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
halted
before
the
National
Gallery
prior
to
parting
I
made
some
further
inquiries
regarding
Armida
,
the
black
-
eyed
,
good
-
looking
housemaid
whom
he
had
married
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
signore
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
responded
in
a
voice
choked
with
emotion
,
dropping
into
Italian
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
one
great
sorrow
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
work
hard
from
early
morning
until
late
at
night
,
but
what
is
the
use
when
I
see
my
poor
wife
gradually
fading
away
before
my
very
eyes
?
<EOS>
The
doctor
says
that
she
can
not
possibly
live
through
the
next
winter
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
delighted
the
poor
girl
would
be
if
she
could
see
the
padrone
once
again
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
felt
sorry
for
him
.
<EOS>
Armida
had
been
a
good
servant
,
and
had
served
me
well
for
nearly
three
years
.
<EOS>
Old
Rosina
,
my
housekeeper
,
had
often
regretted
that
she
had
been
compelled
to
leave
to
attend
to
her
aged
mother
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
he
told
me
,
had
died
,
and
afterwards
he
had
married
her
.
<EOS>
There
is
more
romance
and
tragedy
in
the
lives
of
the
poor
Italians
in
London
than
London
ever
suspects
.
<EOS>
We
are
too
apt
to
regard
the
Italian
as
a
bloodthirsty
person
given
to
the
unlawful
use
of
the
knife
,
whereas
,
as
a
whole
,
the
Italian
colony
in
London
is
a
hard
-
working
,
thrifty
,
and
law
-
abiding
one
,
very
different
,
indeed
,
to
those
colonies
of
aliens
from
Northern
Europe
,
who
are
so
continually
bringing
filth
,
disease
,
and
immorality
into
the
East
End
,
and
are
a
useless
incubus
in
an
already
over
-
populated
city
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
so
wistfully
that
his
wife
might
see
me
once
more
that
,
having
nothing
very
particular
to
do
that
evening
,
and
feeling
a
deep
sympathy
for
the
poor
fellow
in
his
trouble
,
I
resolved
to
accompany
him
to
his
house
and
see
whether
I
could
not
,
in
some
slight
manner
,
render
him
a
little
help
.
 
<EOS>
He
thanked
me
profusely
when
I
consented
to
go
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
signor
padrone
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
gratefully
,
"
she
will
be
so
delighted
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
very
good
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
hailed
a
hansom
and
drove
across
Westminster
Bridge
to
the
address
he
gave
--
a
gloomy
back
street
off
the
York
Road
,
one
of
those
narrow
,
grimy
thoroughfares
into
which
the
sun
never
shines
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
how
often
do
the
poor
Italians
,
those
children
of
the
sun
,
pine
and
die
when
shut
up
in
our
dismal
,
sordid
streets
!
<EOS>
Dirt
and
squalor
do
not
affect
them
;
it
is
the
damp
and
cold
and
lack
of
sunshine
that
so
very
soon
proves
fatal
.
 
<EOS>
A
low
-
looking
,
evil
-
faced
fellow
opened
the
door
to
us
and
growled
acquaintance
with
Olinto
,
who
,
striking
a
match
,
ascended
the
worn
,
carpetless
stairs
before
me
,
apologizing
for
passing
before
me
,
and
saying
in
Italian--
 
"
We
live
at
the
top
,
signore
,
because
it
is
cheaper
and
the
air
is
better
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
right
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
thought
I
heard
my
cab
driving
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
gloomy
,
forbidding
,
unlighted
place
into
which
I
would
certainly
have
hesitated
to
enter
<EOS>
had
not
my
companion
been
my
trusted
servant
.
<EOS>
I
instinctively
disliked
the
look
of
the
fellow
who
had
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
hulking
loafers
of
the
peculiarly
Lambeth
type
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
alien
poor
,
I
recollected
,
can
not
choose
where
they
shall
reside
.
 
<EOS>
Contrary
to
my
expectations
,
the
sitting
-
room
we
entered
on
the
top
floor
was
quite
comfortably
furnished
,
clean
and
respectable
,
even
though
traces
of
poverty
were
apparent
.
<EOS>
A
cheap
lamp
was
burning
upon
the
table
,
but
the
apartment
was
unoccupied
.
 
<EOS>
Olinto
,
in
surprise
,
passed
into
the
adjoining
room
,
returning
a
moment
later
,
exclaiming--
 
<EOS>
"
Armida
must
have
gone
out
to
get
something
.
<EOS>
Or
perhaps
she
is
with
the
people
,
a
compositor
and
his
wife
,
who
live
on
the
floor
below
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
good
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
and
find
her
.
<EOS>
Accommodate
yourself
with
a
chair
,
signore
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
drew
the
best
chair
forward
for
me
,
and
dusted
it
with
his
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
I
allowed
him
to
go
and
fetch
her
,
rather
surprised
that
she
should
be
well
enough
to
get
about
after
all
he
had
told
me
concerning
her
illness
.
<EOS>
Yet
consumption
does
not
keep
people
in
bed
until
its
final
stages
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
stood
there
,
gazing
round
the
room
,
I
could
not
well
distinguish
its
furthermost
corners
,
for
the
lamp
bore
a
shade
of
green
paste
-
board
,
which
threw
a
zone
of
light
upon
the
table
,
and
left
the
remainder
of
the
room
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
When
,
however
,
my
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
,
I
discerned
that
the
place
was
dusty
and
somewhat
disordered
.
<EOS>
The
sofa
was
,
I
saw
,
a
folding
iron
bedstead
with
greasy
old
cushions
,
while
the
carpet
was
threadbare
and
full
of
holes
.
<EOS>
When
I
drew
the
old
rep
curtains
to
look
out
of
the
window
,
I
found
that
the
shutters
were
closed
,
which
I
thought
unusual
for
a
room
so
high
up
as
that
was
.
 
<EOS>
Olinto
returned
in
a
few
moments
,
saying
that
his
wife
had
evidently
gone
to
do
some
shopping
in
the
Lower
-
Marsh
,
for
it
is
the
habit
of
the
denizens
of
that
locality
to
go
"
marketing
"
in
the
evening
among
the
costermongers
'
stalls
that
line
so
many
of
the
thoroughfares
.
<EOS>
Perishable
commodities
,
the
overplus
of
the
markets
and
shops
,
are
cheaper
at
night
than
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
not
pressed
for
time
,
signore
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
apologetically
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
the
poor
girl
does
not
know
the
surprise
awaiting
her
.
<EOS>
She
will
surely
not
be
long
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
wait
,
"
I
said
,
and
flung
myself
back
into
the
chair
he
had
brought
forward
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
offer
you
,
signer
padrone
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
expect
a
visitor
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Olinto
.
<EOS>
I
've
only
just
had
dinner
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
how
you
have
fared
since
you
left
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
laughed
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
many
ups
and
downs
before
I
found
myself
here
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
sea
did
not
suit
me
--
neither
did
the
work
.
<EOS>
They
put
me
in
the
emigrants
'
quarters
,
and
consequently
I
could
gain
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
other
stewards
were
Neapolitans
,
therefore
,
because
I
was
a
Tuscan
,
they
relegated
me
to
the
worst
post
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
signore
,
you
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
serve
those
emigrants
!
<EOS>
I
made
two
trips
,
then
returned
and
married
Armida
.
<EOS>
I
called
on
you
,
but
Tito
said
you
were
in
London
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
got
work
at
a
cafe
in
Viareggio
,
but
when
the
season
ended
,
and
I
was
thrown
out
of
employment
<EOS>
,
I
managed
to
work
my
way
from
Genoa
to
London
.
<EOS>
My
first
place
was
scullion
in
a
restaurant
in
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
and
then
I
became
waiter
in
the
beer
-
hall
at
the
Monico
,
and
managed
to
save
sufficient
to
send
Armida
the
money
to
join
me
here
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
I
went
to
the
Milano
,
and
I
hope
to
get
into
one
of
the
big
hotels
very
soon
--
or
perhaps
the
grill
-
room
at
the
Carlton
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
friend
who
is
there
,
and
they
make
lots
of
money
--
four
or
five
pounds
every
week
in
tips
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
what
I
can
do
for
you
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
several
hotel
-
managers
who
might
have
a
vacancy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
signore
!
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
filled
with
gratification
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
only
would
!
<EOS>
A
word
from
you
would
secure
me
a
good
position
.
<EOS>
I
can
work
,
that
you
know
--
and
I
do
work
.
<EOS>
I
will
work
--
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
promised
you
,
"
I
said
briefly
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
can
I
sufficiently
thank
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
standing
before
me
,
while
in
his
eyes
I
thought
I
detected
a
strange
wild
look
,
such
as
I
had
never
seen
there
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
served
me
well
,
<EOS>
Olinto
,
"
I
replied
,
"
and
when
I
discover
real
sterling
honesty
<EOS>
I
endeavor
to
appreciate
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
alas
!
<EOS>
very
little
of
it
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
his
manner
suddenly
changing
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
to
-
night
shown
me
,
signore
,
that
you
are
my
friend
,
and
I
will
,
in
return
,
show
you
that
I
am
yours
.
"
<EOS>
And
suddenly
grasping
both
my
hands
,
he
pulled
me
from
the
chair
in
which
I
was
sitting
,
at
the
same
time
asking
in
a
low
intense
whisper
:
"
Do
you
always
carry
a
revolver
here
in
England
,
as
you
do
in
Italy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
answered
in
surprise
at
his
action
and
his
question
.
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
there
is
danger
here
,
"
he
answered
in
the
same
low
earnest
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Get
your
weapon
ready
.
<EOS>
You
may
want
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
,
"
I
said
,
feeling
my
handy
Colt
in
my
back
pocket
to
make
sure
it
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forget
what
I
have
said
--
all
--
all
that
I
have
told
you
to
-
night
,
sir
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
explained
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
peril
--
in
deadly
peril
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
breathlessly
,
surprised
at
his
extraordinary
change
of
manner
and
his
evident
apprehension
lest
something
should
befall
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
,
and
you
shall
see
,
"
he
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
But
first
tell
me
,
signore
,
that
you
will
forgive
me
for
the
part
I
have
played
in
this
dastardly
affair
.
<EOS>
I
,
like
yourself
,
fell
innocently
into
the
hands
of
your
enemies
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
enemies
!
<EOS>
Who
are
they
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
unknown
,
and
for
the
present
must
remain
so
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
doubt
your
peril
,
watch--
"
and
taking
the
rusty
fire
-
tongs
from
the
grate
he
carefully
placed
them
on
end
in
front
of
the
deep
old
armchair
in
which
I
had
sat
,
and
then
allowed
them
to
fall
against
the
edge
of
the
seat
,
springing
quickly
back
as
he
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
a
bright
blue
flash
shot
through
the
place
,
and
the
irons
fell
aside
,
fused
and
twisted
out
of
all
recognition
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
aghast
,
utterly
unable
for
the
moment
to
sufficiently
realize
how
narrowly
I
had
escaped
death
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
!
<EOS>
See
here
,
behind
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Italian
,
directing
my
attention
to
the
back
legs
of
the
chair
,
where
,
on
bending
with
the
lamp
,
I
saw
,
to
my
surprise
,
that
two
wires
were
connected
,
and
ran
along
the
floor
and
out
of
the
window
,
while
concealed
beneath
the
ragged
carpet
,
in
front
of
the
chair
,
was
a
thin
plate
of
steel
,
whereon
my
feet
had
rested
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
had
so
ingeniously
enticed
me
to
that
gloomy
house
of
death
had
connected
up
the
overhead
electric
light
main
with
that
innocent
-
looking
chair
,
and
from
some
unseen
point
had
been
able
to
switch
on
a
current
of
sufficient
voltage
to
kill
fifty
men
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
stock
-
still
,
not
daring
to
move
lest
I
might
come
into
contact
with
some
hidden
wire
,
the
slightest
touch
of
which
must
bring
instant
death
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
enemies
prepared
this
terrible
trap
for
you
,
"
declared
the
man
who
was
once
my
trusted
servant
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
entered
into
the
affair
I
was
not
aware
that
it
was
to
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
They
gave
me
no
inkling
of
their
dastardly
intention
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
no
time
to
admit
of
explanations
now
,
signore
,
"
he
added
breathlessly
,
in
a
low
desperate
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Say
that
you
will
not
prejudge
me
,
"
he
pleaded
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
prejudge
you
until
I
've
heard
your
explanation
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
owe
my
life
to
you
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
quick
!
<EOS>
Fly
from
this
house
this
instant
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
stopped
,
then
use
your
revolver
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
hesitate
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
they
will
be
here
upon
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
who
are
they
,
Olinto
?
<EOS>
You
must
tell
me
,
"
I
cried
in
desperation
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Dio
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Go
!
<EOS>
Go
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
pushing
me
violently
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fly
,
or
we
shall
both
die
--
both
of
us
!
<EOS>
Run
downstairs
.
<EOS>
I
must
make
feint
of
dashing
after
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
turned
,
and
seeing
his
desperate
eagerness
,
precipitately
fled
,
while
he
ran
down
behind
me
,
uttering
fierce
imprecations
in
Italian
,
as
though
I
had
escaped
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
in
the
narrow
dark
passage
attempted
to
trip
me
up
as
I
ran
,
but
I
fired
point
blank
at
him
,
and
gaining
the
door
unlocked
it
,
and
an
instant
later
found
myself
out
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
narrowest
escape
from
death
that
I
had
ever
had
in
all
my
life
--
surely
the
strangest
and
most
remarkable
adventure
.
<EOS>
What
,
I
wondered
,
did
it
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
I
searched
up
and
down
Oxford
Street
for
the
Restaurant
Milano
,
but
could
not
find
it
.
<EOS>
I
asked
shopkeepers
,
postmen
,
and
policemen
;
I
examined
the
London
Directory
at
the
bar
of
the
Oxford
Music
Hall
,
and
made
every
inquiry
possible
.
<EOS>
But
all
was
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
No
one
knew
of
such
a
place
.
<EOS>
There
were
restaurants
in
plenty
in
Oxford
Street
,
from
the
Frascati
down
to
the
humble
coffeeshop
,
but
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
the
"
Milano
.
"
 
<EOS>
Even
Olinto
had
played
me
false
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
filled
with
chagrin
,
for
I
had
trusted
him
as
honest
,
upright
,
and
industrious
;
and
was
puzzled
to
know
the
reason
he
had
deceived
me
,
and
why
he
had
enticed
me
to
the
very
brink
of
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
told
me
that
he
himself
had
fallen
into
the
trap
laid
by
my
enemies
,
and
yet
he
had
steadfastly
refused
to
tell
me
who
they
were
!
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
was
utterly
inexplicable
.
 
<EOS>
I
drove
over
to
Lambeth
and
wandered
through
the
maze
of
mean
streets
off
the
York
Road
,
yet
for
the
life
of
me
<EOS>
I
could
not
decide
into
which
house
I
had
been
taken
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
dozen
which
seemed
to
me
that
they
might
be
the
identical
house
from
which
I
had
so
narrowly
escaped
with
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
it
became
impressed
upon
me
that
my
ex
-
servant
had
somehow
gained
knowledge
that
I
was
in
London
,
that
he
had
watched
my
exit
from
the
club
,
and
that
all
his
pitiful
story
regarding
Armida
was
false
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
envoy
of
my
unknown
enemies
,
who
had
so
ingeniously
and
so
relentlessly
plotted
my
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
had
enemies
I
knew
quite
well
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
believes
he
has
not
is
an
arrant
fool
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
man
breathing
who
has
not
an
enemy
,
from
the
pauper
in
the
workhouse
to
the
king
in
his
automobile
.
<EOS>
But
the
unseen
enemy
is
always
the
more
dangerous
;
hence
my
deep
apprehensive
reflections
that
day
as
I
walked
those
sordid
back
streets
"
over
the
water
,
"
as
the
Cockney
refers
to
the
district
between
those
two
main
arteries
of
traffic
,
the
Waterloo
and
Westminster
Bridge
Roads
.
 
<EOS>
My
unknown
enemies
had
secured
the
services
of
Olinto
in
their
dastardly
plot
to
kill
me
.
<EOS>
With
what
motive
?
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
as
I
crossed
Waterloo
Bridge
to
the
Strand
,
whether
Olinto
Santini
would
again
approach
me
and
make
the
promised
explanation
.
<EOS>
I
had
given
my
word
not
to
prejudge
him
until
he
revealed
to
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
could
not
,
in
the
circumstances
,
repose
entire
confidence
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
one
's
enemies
are
unknown
,
the
feeling
of
apprehension
is
always
much
greater
,
for
in
the
imagination
danger
lurks
in
every
corner
,
and
every
action
of
a
friend
covers
the
ruse
of
a
suspected
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
That
day
I
did
my
business
in
the
city
with
a
distrust
of
everyone
,
not
knowing
whether
I
was
not
followed
or
whether
those
who
sought
my
life
were
not
plotting
some
other
equally
ingenious
move
whereby
I
might
go
innocently
to
my
death
.
<EOS>
I
endeavored
to
discover
Olinto
by
every
possible
means
during
those
stifling
days
that
followed
.
<EOS>
The
heat
of
London
was
,
to
me
,
more
oppressive
than
the
fiery
sunshine
of
the
old
-
world
Tuscany
,
and
everyone
who
could
be
out
of
town
had
left
for
the
country
or
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
trace
I
found
of
the
Italian
was
that
he
was
registered
at
the
office
of
the
International
Society
of
Hotel
Servants
,
in
Shaftesbury
Avenue
,
as
being
employed
at
Gatti
's
Adelaide
Gallery
,
but
on
inquiry
there
I
found
he
had
left
more
than
a
year
before
,
and
none
of
his
fellow
-
waiters
knew
his
whereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
being
defeated
in
every
inquiry
,
and
my
business
at
last
concluded
in
London
,
I
went
up
to
Dumfries
on
a
duty
visit
which
I
paid
annually
to
my
uncle
,
Sir
George
Little
.
<EOS>
Having
known
Dumfries
since
my
earliest
boyhood
,
and
having
spent
some
years
of
my
youth
there
,
I
had
many
friends
in
the
vicinity
,
for
Sir
George
and
my
aunt
were
very
popular
in
the
county
and
moved
in
the
best
set
.
 
<EOS>
Each
time
I
returned
from
abroad
<EOS>
I
was
always
a
welcome
guest
at
Greenlaw
,
as
their
place
outside
the
city
of
Burns
was
called
,
and
this
occasion
proved
no
exception
,
for
the
country
houses
of
Dumfries
are
always
gay
in
August
in
prospect
of
the
shooting
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
new
people
have
taken
Rannoch
Castle
.
<EOS>
Rather
nice
they
seem
,
"
remarked
my
aunt
as
we
were
sitting
together
at
luncheon
the
day
after
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
"
Their
name
is
Leithcourt
,
and
they
've
asked
me
to
drive
you
over
there
to
tennis
this
afternoon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
much
of
a
player
,
you
know
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
In
Italy
we
do
n't
believe
in
athletics
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
's
out
of
politeness
,
of
course
,
I
'll
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
order
the
victoria
for
three
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
several
nice
girls
there
,
Gordon
,
"
remarked
my
uncle
mischievously
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
good
time
,
so
do
n't
think
you
are
going
to
be
bored
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
fear
of
that
,
"
was
my
answer
.
<EOS>
And
at
three
o'clock
Sir
George
,
his
wife
,
and
myself
set
out
for
that
fine
old
historic
castle
that
stands
high
on
the
Bognie
,
overlooking
the
Cairn
waters
beyond
Dunscore
,
one
of
the
strongholds
of
the
Black
Douglas
in
those
turbulent
days
of
long
ago
,
and
now
a
splendid
old
residence
with
a
big
shoot
which
was
sometimes
let
for
the
season
at
a
very
high
rent
by
its
aristocratic
if
somewhat
impecunious
owner
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
see
its
great
round
towers
,
standing
grim
and
gray
on
the
hillside
commanding
the
whole
of
the
valley
,
long
before
we
approached
it
,
and
when
we
drove
into
the
grounds
we
found
a
gay
party
in
summer
<EOS>
toilettes
assembled
on
the
ancient
bowling
-
green
,
now
transformed
into
a
modern
tennis
-
lawn
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Leithcourt
and
her
husband
,
a
tall
,
thin
,
gray
-
headed
,
well
-
dressed
man
,
both
came
forward
to
greet
us
,
and
after
a
few
introductions
I
joined
a
set
at
tennis
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
merry
crowd
.
<EOS>
The
Leithcourts
were
entertaining
a
large
house
-
party
,
and
their
hospitality
was
on
a
scale
quite
in
keeping
with
the
fine
old
place
they
rented
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
was
served
on
the
lawn
by
the
footmen
,
and
afterwards
,
being
tired
of
the
game
<EOS>
,
I
found
myself
strolling
with
Muriel
Leithcourt
,
a
bright
,
dark
-
eyed
girl
with
tightly
-
bound
hair
,
and
wearing
a
cotton
blouse
and
flannel
tennis
skirt
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
apologizing
for
my
terribly
bad
play
,
explaining
that
I
had
no
practice
out
in
Italy
,
whereupon
<EOS>
she
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
Italy
slightly
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
Florence
and
Naples
with
mother
last
season
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
we
began
to
discuss
pictures
and
sculptures
and
the
sights
of
Italy
generally
.
<EOS>
I
discerned
from
her
remarks
that
she
had
traveled
widely
;
indeed
,
she
told
me
that
both
her
father
and
mother
were
never
happier
than
when
moving
from
place
to
place
in
search
of
variety
and
distraction
.
<EOS>
We
had
entered
the
huge
paneled
hall
of
the
Castle
,
and
had
passed
up
the
quaint
old
stone
staircase
to
the
long
banqueting
hall
with
its
paneled
oak
ceiling
,
which
in
these
modern
days
had
been
transformed
into
a
bright
,
pleasant
drawing
-
room
,
from
the
windows
of
which
was
presented
a
marvelous
view
over
the
lovely
Nithsdale
and
across
to
the
heather
-
clad
hills
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
lounging
there
in
the
cool
old
room
after
the
hot
sunshine
outside
,
and
as
I
gazed
around
the
place
I
noted
how
much
more
luxurious
and
tasteful
<EOS>
it
now
was
to
what
it
had
been
in
the
days
when
I
had
visited
its
owner
several
years
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
awfully
glad
to
be
up
here
,
"
my
pretty
companion
was
saying
.
<EOS>
"
We
had
such
a
busy
season
in
London
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
went
on
to
describe
the
Court
ball
,
and
two
or
three
of
the
most
notable
functions
about
which
I
had
read
in
my
English
paper
beside
the
Mediterranean
.
 
<EOS>
She
attracted
me
on
account
of
her
bright
vivacity
,
quick
wit
and
keen
sense
of
humor
,
therefore
I
sat
listening
to
her
pleasant
chatter
.
<EOS>
Exiled
as
I
was
in
a
foreign
land
,
I
seldom
spoke
English
save
with
Hutcheson
,
the
Consul
,
and
even
then
we
generally
spoke
Italian
if
there
were
others
present
,
in
order
that
our
companions
should
understand
.
<EOS>
Therefore
her
gossip
interested
me
,
and
as
the
golden
sunset
flooded
the
handsome
old
room
I
sat
listening
to
her
,
inwardly
admiring
her
innate
grace
and
handsome
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
idea
who
or
what
her
father
was
--
whether
a
wealthy
manufacturer
,
like
so
many
who
take
expensive
shoots
and
give
big
entertainments
in
order
to
edge
their
way
into
Society
by
its
back
door
,
or
whether
he
was
a
gentleman
of
means
and
of
good
family
.
<EOS>
I
rather
guessed
the
latter
,
from
his
gentlemanly
bearing
and
polished
manner
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
,
tall
and
erect
,
was
that
of
a
retired
officer
,
and
his
clean
-
cut
face
was
one
of
marked
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
telling
my
pretty
companion
something
of
my
own
life
,
<EOS>
how
,
because
I
loved
Italy
<EOS>
so
well
,
I
lived
in
Tuscany
in
preference
to
living
in
England
,
and
how
each
year
I
came
home
for
a
month
or
two
to
visit
my
relations
and
to
keep
in
touch
with
things
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
once
in
Leghorn
for
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
We
were
yachting
in
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
I
love
the
sea
--
and
yachting
is
such
awfully
good
fun
,
if
you
only
get
decent
weather
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
mention
of
yachting
brought
back
to
my
mind
the
visit
of
the
_
Lola
_
and
its
mysterious
sequel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
father
has
a
yacht
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
,
with
as
little
concern
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
The
_
Iris
_
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
is
cruising
on
her
up
the
Norwegian
Fiords
.
<EOS>
For
us
it
is
a
change
to
be
here
,
because
we
are
so
often
afloat
.
<EOS>
We
went
across
to
New
York
in
her
last
year
and
had
a
most
delightful
time
--
except
for
one
bad
squall
which
made
us
all
a
little
bit
nervous
.
<EOS>
But
Moyes
is
such
an
excellent
captain
that
I
never
fear
.
<EOS>
The
crew
are
all
North
Sea
fishermen
--
father
will
engage
nobody
else
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
blame
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
you
must
have
made
many
long
voyages
,
and
seen
many
odd
corners
of
the
world
,
Miss
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
,
my
interest
in
her
increasing
,
for
she
seemed
so
extremely
intelligent
and
well
-
informed
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
We
've
been
to
Mexico
,
and
to
Panama
,
besides
Morocco
,
Egypt
,
and
the
West
Coast
of
Africa
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
've
actually
landed
at
Leghorn
!
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
we
did
n't
stay
there
more
than
an
hour
--
to
send
a
telegram
,
I
think
it
was
.
<EOS>
Father
said
there
was
nothing
to
see
there
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
went
ashore
,
and
I
must
say
I
was
rather
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
.
<EOS>
The
town
itself
is
ugly
and
uninteresting
.
<EOS>
But
the
outskirts
--
San
Jacopo
,
Ardenza
and
Antigniano
are
all
delightful
.
<EOS>
It
was
unfortunate
that
you
did
not
see
them
.
<EOS>
Was
it
long
ago
when
you
put
in
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
very
long
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
recollect
the
exact
date
,
"
was
her
reply
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
on
our
way
home
from
Alexandria
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
ever
,
in
any
of
the
ports
you
've
been
,
seen
a
yacht
called
the
_
Lola
_
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
eagerly
,
for
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
she
might
be
able
to
give
me
information
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
_
Lola
_
!
<EOS>
"
she
gasped
,
and
instantly
her
face
changed
.
<EOS>
A
flush
overspread
her
cheeks
,
succeeded
next
moment
by
a
death
-
like
pallor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
_
Lola
_
!
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
in
a
strange
,
hoarse
voice
,
at
the
same
time
endeavoring
strenuously
not
to
exhibit
any
apprehension
.
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
heard
of
any
such
a
vessel
.
<EOS>
Is
she
a
steam
-
yacht
?
<EOS>
Who
's
her
owner
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
regarded
her
in
amazement
and
suspicion
,
for
I
saw
that
mention
of
the
name
had
aroused
within
her
some
serious
misgiving
.
<EOS>
That
look
in
her
dark
eyes
as
they
fixed
themselves
upon
me
was
one
of
distinct
and
unspeakable
terror
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
she
possibly
know
concerning
the
mysterious
craft
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
the
owner
's
name
,
"
I
said
,
still
affecting
not
to
have
noticed
her
alarm
and
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
The
vessel
ran
aground
at
the
Meloria
,
a
dangerous
shoal
outside
Leghorn
,
and
through
the
stupidity
of
her
captain
was
very
nearly
lost
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
?
<EOS>
"
she
gasped
,
in
a
half
-
whisper
,
bending
to
me
eagerly
,
unable
to
sufficiently
conceal
the
terrible
anxiety
consuming
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
--
did
you
go
aboard
her
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
was
the
only
word
I
uttered
.
 
<EOS>
A
silence
fell
between
us
,
and
as
my
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
her
,
I
saw
that
from
her
handsome
mobile
countenance
all
the
light
and
life
had
suddenly
gone
out
,
and
I
knew
that
she
was
in
secret
possession
of
the
key
to
that
remarkable
enigma
that
so
puzzled
me
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
sudden
the
door
opened
,
and
a
voice
cried
gayly--
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
've
been
looking
everywhere
for
you
,
Muriel
.
<EOS>
Why
are
you
hidden
here
?
<EOS>
Are
n't
you
coming
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
both
turned
,
and
as
she
did
so
a
low
cry
of
blank
dismay
involuntarily
escaped
her
.
 
<EOS>
Next
instant
<EOS>
I
sprang
to
my
feet
.
<EOS>
The
reason
of
her
cry
was
apparent
,
for
there
,
in
the
full
light
of
the
golden
sunset
streaming
through
the
long
open
windows
,
stood
a
broad
-
shouldered
,
fair
-
bearded
man
in
tennis
flannels
and
a
Panama
hat
--
the
fugitive
I
knew
as
Philip
Hornby
!
 
<EOS>
I
faced
him
,
speechless
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IV
 
<EOS>
IN
WHICH
THE
MYSTERY
INCREASES
  
<EOS>
Neither
of
us
spoke
.
<EOS>
Equally
surprised
at
the
unexpected
encounter
,
we
stood
facing
each
other
dumbfounded
.
 
<EOS>
Hornby
started
quickly
as
soon
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
me
,
and
his
face
became
blanched
to
the
lips
,
while
Muriel
Leithcourt
,
quick
to
notice
the
sudden
change
in
him
,
rose
and
introduced
us
in
as
calm
a
voice
as
she
could
command
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
are
acquainted
,
"
she
said
to
me
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
Mr.
Martin
Woodroffe
--
<EOS>
Mr
.
Gordon
Gregg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
bowed
to
him
in
sudden
resolve
to
remain
silent
in
pretense
that
I
doubted
whether
the
man
before
me
was
actually
my
host
of
the
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
I
intended
to
act
as
though
I
was
not
sufficiently
convinced
to
openly
express
my
doubt
.
<EOS>
Therefore
we
bowed
,
exchanging
greetings
as
strangers
,
while
,
carefully
watching
,
I
saw
how
greatly
the
minds
of
both
were
relieved
.
<EOS>
They
shot
meaning
glances
at
each
other
,
and
then
,
as
though
reassured
that
I
was
mystified
and
uncertain
,
the
man
who
called
himself
Woodroffe
explained
to
my
companion------
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
over
to
Newton
Stewart
with
Fred
all
day
,
and
only
got
back
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
Are
n't
you
playing
any
more
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
was
her
reply
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
been
out
there
the
whole
afternoon
,
and
I
'm
rather
tired
.
<EOS>
But
they
're
still
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
You
can
surely
get
a
game
with
someone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
play
,
I
sha
n't
.
<EOS>
I
returned
to
keep
the
promise
I
made
this
morning
,
"
he
laughed
,
standing
before
the
big
open
fireplace
,
holding
his
tennis
racquet
behind
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
examined
his
countenance
,
and
was
more
than
ever
convinced
that
he
was
actually
the
man
who
gave
me
the
name
of
Hornby
and
the
false
address
in
Somerset
.
<EOS>
The
pair
seemed
to
be
on
familiar
terms
,
and
I
wondered
whether
they
were
engaged
.
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
the
man
seemed
quite
at
home
there
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
chatted
with
the
daughter
of
the
house
,
he
cast
a
quick
,
covert
glance
at
me
,
and
then
darted
a
meaning
look
at
her
--
a
look
of
renewed
confidence
,
as
though
he
felt
that
he
had
successfully
averted
any
suspicions
I
might
have
held
.
 
<EOS>
We
talked
of
the
prospects
of
the
grouse
and
the
salmon
,
and
from
his
remarks
he
seemed
to
be
as
keen
at
sport
as
he
had
once
made
out
himself
to
be
at
yachting
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Leithcourt
is
awfully
fortunate
in
getting
such
a
splendid
old
place
as
this
.
<EOS>
On
every
hand
I
hear
glowing
accounts
of
the
number
of
birds
.
<EOS>
The
place
has
been
well
preserved
in
the
past
,
and
there
's
plenty
of
good
cover
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Gilrae
,
the
owner
,
is
a
keen
sportsman
,
and
before
he
became
so
hard
up
<EOS>
he
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
the
estate
,
which
,
I
believe
,
has
always
been
considered
one
of
the
very
best
in
the
southwest
.
<EOS>
There
's
salmon
,
they
say
,
down
in
the
Glen
yonder
--
<EOS>
but
I
've
never
tried
for
any
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
there
is
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
several
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
try
one
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
The
Glen
is
deep
and
shady
--
an
ideal
place
for
fish
.
<EOS>
The
only
disappointment
here
,
as
far
as
I
can
make
out
,
is
the
very
few
head
of
black
-
game
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
but
every
year
they
are
getting
rarer
and
rarer
in
this
part
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
A
really
fine
black
-
cock
is
quite
an
event
nowadays
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
While
we
were
talking
,
or
rather
while
I
was
carefully
watching
the
rapid
working
of
his
mind
,
Leithcourt
himself
entered
and
joined
us
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
playing
tennis
,
and
had
come
in
to
rest
and
cool
.
 
<EOS>
Host
and
guest
were
evidently
on
the
most
intimate
terms
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
addressed
him
as
"
Martin
,
"
and
began
to
relate
a
quarrel
which
his
head
-
gamekeeper
had
had
that
day
with
one
of
the
small
farmers
on
the
estate
regarding
the
killing
of
some
rabbits
.
<EOS>
And
while
they
were
talking
Muriel
suggested
that
we
should
stroll
down
to
the
tennis
-
courts
again
,
an
invitation
which
,
much
as
I
regretted
leaving
the
two
men
,
I
was
bound
to
accept
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
she
wished
purposely
to
take
me
away
from
that
man
's
presence
,
fearing
that
by
remaining
there
longer
my
suspicions
might
become
confirmed
.
<EOS>
She
was
acting
in
conjunction
with
the
man
whom
I
had
known
as
Hornby
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
still
a
good
many
people
watching
the
game
,
for
it
was
pleasant
in
those
old
-
world
gardens
in
the
sunset
hour
.
<EOS>
The
dried
-
up
moat
was
now
transformed
into
a
garden
filled
with
rhododendrons
and
bright
azaleas
,
while
the
high
ancient
beech
-
hedges
,
the
quaint
old
sundial
with
its
motto
:
"
Each
time
ye
shadowe
turneth
ys
one
daye
nearer
unto
dethe
,
"
and
the
old
stone
balustrades
gray
with
lichen
,
all
spoke
mutely
of
those
glorious
days
when
the
fierce
horsemen
of
the
Lairds
of
Rannoch
were
feared
across
the
Border
,
and
when
many
a
prisoner
of
the
Black
Douglas
had
pined
and
died
in
those
narrow
stone
chambers
in
the
grim
north
tower
that
still
stood
high
above
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
party
strolling
and
lounging
there
prior
to
departure
were
quite
a
number
of
people
I
knew
,
people
who
had
shooting
-
boxes
in
the
vicinity
and
were
my
uncle
's
friends
.
<EOS>
In
Scotland
there
is
always
a
hearty
hospitality
among
the
sporting
folk
,
and
the
laws
of
caste
are
far
less
rigorous
than
they
are
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
standing
chatting
with
two
ladies
who
were
about
to
take
leave
of
their
hostess
,
when
Leithcourt
returned
,
but
alone
.
<EOS>
Hornby
had
not
accompanied
him
.
<EOS>
Was
it
because
he
feared
to
again
meet
me
?
 
<EOS>
In
order
to
ascertain
something
regarding
the
man
who
had
so
mysteriously
fled
from
Leghorn
,
I
managed
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
diplomacy
to
sit
on
the
lawn
with
a
young
married
woman
named
Tennant
,
wife
of
a
cavalry
captain
,
who
was
one
of
the
house
-
party
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
time
I
succeeded
in
turning
the
conversation
to
her
fellow
guests
,
and
more
particularly
to
the
man
I
knew
as
Hornby
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodroffe
is
most
amusing
,
"
declared
the
bright
little
woman
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
always
playing
some
practical
joke
or
other
.
<EOS>
After
dinner
he
is
usually
the
life
and
soul
of
our
party
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
like
what
little
I
have
seen
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
very
good
fellow
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
I
've
heard
that
he
's
engaged
to
Muriel
,
"
I
hazarded
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
true
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
They
've
been
engaged
nearly
a
year
,
but
he
's
been
abroad
until
quite
lately
.
<EOS>
He
is
rather
close
about
his
own
affairs
,
and
never
talks
about
his
travels
and
adventures
,
although
one
day
Mr.
Leithcourt
declared
that
his
hairbreadth
escapes
would
make
a
most
exciting
book
if
ever
written
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leithcourt
and
<EOS>
he
are
evidently
most
intimate
friends
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
quite
inseparable
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
laughed
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
other
man
who
is
always
with
them
is
that
short
,
stout
,
red
-
faced
old
fellow
standing
over
there
with
the
lady
in
pale
blue
,
Sir
Ughtred
Gardner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodroffe
has
nicknamed
him
'
Sir
Putrid
.
'
"
<EOS>
And
we
both
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
do
n't
say
I
said
so
,
"
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
call
him
that
to
his
face
,
but
it
's
so
easy
to
make
a
mistake
in
his
name
when
he
's
not
within
hearing
.
<EOS>
We
women
do
n't
care
for
him
,
so
the
nickname
just
fits
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
gossiped
on
,
telling
me
much
that
I
desired
to
know
regarding
the
new
tenant
of
Rannoch
and
his
friends
,
and
more
especially
of
that
man
who
had
first
introduced
himself
to
me
in
the
Consulate
at
Leghorn
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
my
uncle
's
carriage
was
announced
,
and
I
left
with
the
distinct
impression
that
there
was
some
deep
mystery
surrounding
the
Leithcourts
.
<EOS>
What
it
was
,
however
,
I
could
not
,
for
the
life
of
me
,
make
out
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
Philip
Leithcourt
's
intimate
relation
with
the
man
who
had
so
cleverly
deceived
me
that
incited
my
curiosity
concerning
him
;
perhaps
it
was
that
mysterious
intuition
,
that
curious
presage
of
evil
that
sometimes
comes
to
a
man
as
warning
of
impending
peril
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
reason
,
I
had
become
filled
with
grave
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
grew
deeper
day
by
day
,
and
was
inexplicable
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
week
that
followed
I
sought
to
learn
all
I
could
regarding
the
new
people
at
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
taken
up
everywhere
,
"
declared
my
aunt
when
I
questioned
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
,
we
knew
very
little
of
them
,
except
that
they
had
a
shoot
up
near
Fort
William
two
years
ago
,
and
that
they
have
a
town
house
in
Green
Street
.
<EOS>
They
are
evidently
rather
smart
folks
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Judging
from
their
house
-
party
,
yes
,
"
I
responded
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
about
as
gay
a
crowd
as
one
could
find
north
of
Carlisle
just
at
present
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
well
-
known
people
among
them
,
too
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
asked
them
over
to
-
morrow
afternoon
,
and
they
've
accepted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Excellent
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
,
for
I
wanted
an
opportunity
for
another
chat
with
the
dark
-
eyed
girl
who
was
engaged
to
the
man
whose
alias
was
Hornby
.
<EOS>
I
particularly
desired
to
ascertain
the
reason
of
her
fear
when
I
had
mentioned
the
_
Lola
_
,
and
whether
she
possessed
any
knowledge
of
Hylton
Chater
.
 
<EOS>
The
opportunity
came
to
me
in
due
course
,
for
next
afternoon
the
Rannoch
party
drove
over
in
two
large
brakes
,
and
with
other
people
from
the
neighborhood
and
a
band
from
Dumfries
,
my
aunt
's
grounds
presented
a
gay
and
animated
scene
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
usual
tennis
and
croquet
,
while
some
of
the
men
enjoyed
a
little
putting
on
the
excellent
course
my
uncle
,
a
golf
enthusiast
,
had
recently
laid
down
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
expected
,
Woodroffe
did
not
accompany
the
party
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Leithcourt
,
a
slightly
fussy
little
woman
,
apologized
for
his
absence
,
explaining
that
he
had
been
recalled
to
London
suddenly
a
few
days
before
,
but
was
returning
to
Rannoch
again
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
could
n't
afford
to
lose
him
,
"
she
declared
to
my
aunt
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
so
awfully
humorous
--
<EOS>
his
droll
sayings
and
antics
keep
us
in
a
perfect
roar
each
night
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
's
such
a
perfect
mimic
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
turned
away
and
strolled
with
Muriel
,
pleading
an
excuse
to
show
her
my
uncle
's
beautiful
grounds
,
not
a
whit
less
picturesque
than
those
of
the
castle
,
and
perhaps
rather
better
kept
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
heard
yesterday
of
your
engagement
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
remarked
presently
when
we
were
alone
.
"
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
offer
my
best
congratulations
.
<EOS>
When
you
introduced
me
to
Mr.
Woodroffe
the
other
day
I
had
no
idea
that
he
was
to
be
your
husband
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
glanced
at
me
quickly
,
and
I
saw
in
her
dark
eyes
a
look
of
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Then
she
flushed
slightly
,
and
laughing
uneasily
said
,
in
a
blank
,
hard
voice--
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
good
of
you
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
to
wish
me
all
sorts
of
such
pleasant
things
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
when
is
the
happy
event
to
take
place
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
date
is
not
exactly
fixed
--
early
next
year
,
I
believe
,
"
and
I
thought
she
sighed
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
probably
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
yachting
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
,
my
eyes
fixed
upon
her
in
order
to
watch
the
result
of
my
pointed
remark
.
<EOS>
But
she
controlled
herself
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
love
the
sea
,
"
she
responded
briefly
,
and
her
eyes
were
set
straight
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Woodroffe
has
gone
up
to
town
,
your
mother
says
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
<EOS>
He
received
a
wire
,
and
had
to
leave
immediately
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
awful
bore
,
for
we
had
arranged
to
go
for
a
picnic
to
Dundrennan
Abbey
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
he
'll
be
back
here
again
,
wo
n't
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
It
seems
quite
uncertain
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
this
morning
which
said
he
might
have
to
go
over
to
Hamburg
on
business
,
instead
of
coming
up
to
us
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
disappointment
in
her
voice
,
and
yet
at
the
same
time
I
could
not
fail
to
recognize
how
the
man
to
whom
she
was
engaged
had
fled
from
Scotland
because
of
my
presence
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
longed
to
ask
her
point
-
blank
what
she
really
knew
of
the
yachtsman
who
was
shrouded
in
so
much
mystery
.
<EOS>
Yet
by
betraying
any
undue
anxiety
I
should
certainly
negative
all
my
efforts
to
solve
the
puzzling
enigma
,
therefore
I
was
compelled
to
remain
content
with
asking
ingeniously
disguised
questions
and
drawing
my
own
conclusions
from
her
answers
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
passed
along
those
graveled
walks
<EOS>
it
somehow
became
vividly
impressed
upon
me
that
her
marriage
was
being
forced
upon
her
by
her
parents
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
that
of
one
who
was
concealing
some
strange
and
terrible
secret
which
she
feared
might
be
revealed
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
distant
look
of
unutterable
terror
in
those
dark
eyes
as
though
she
existed
in
some
constant
and
ever
-
present
dread
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
told
me
nothing
of
her
own
feelings
or
affections
,
yet
I
recognized
in
both
her
words
and
her
bearing
a
curious
apathy
--
a
want
of
the
real
enthusiasm
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Woodroffe
,
much
her
senior
,
was
her
father
's
friend
,
and
it
therefore
seemed
to
me
more
than
likely
that
Leithcourt
was
pressing
a
matrimonial
alliance
upon
his
daughter
for
some
ulterior
motive
.
<EOS>
In
the
mad
hurry
for
place
,
power
,
and
wealth
,
men
relentlessly
sell
their
daughters
in
the
matrimonial
market
,
and
ambitious
mothers
scheme
and
intrigue
for
their
own
aggrandizement
at
sacrifice
of
their
daughter
's
happiness
more
often
than
the
public
ever
dream
.
<EOS>
Tragedy
is
,
alas
!
<EOS>
written
upon
the
face
of
many
a
bride
whose
portrait
appears
in
the
fashion
-
papers
and
whose
toilette
is
so
faithfully
chronicled
in
the
paragraph
beneath
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
girl
in
Society
who
is
allowed
her
own
free
choice
in
the
matter
of
a
husband
is
,
alas
!
<EOS>
nowadays
the
exception
,
for
parents
who
want
to
"
get
on
"
up
the
social
scale
have
found
that
pretty
daughters
are
a
marketable
commodity
,
and
many
a
man
has
been
placed
"
on
his
legs
,
"
both
financially
and
socially
,
by
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Hence
the
marriage
of
convenience
is
fast
becoming
common
,
while
in
the
same
ratio
the
divorce
petitions
are
unfortunately
on
the
increase
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
tragedy
in
the
dark
luminous
eyes
of
Muriel
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
her
young
heart
was
over
-
burdened
by
some
secret
sorrow
or
guilty
knowledge
that
she
would
reveal
to
me
if
she
dared
.
<EOS>
Her
own
words
told
me
that
she
was
perplexed
;
that
she
longed
to
confide
and
seek
advice
of
someone
,
yet
by
reason
of
some
hidden
and
untoward
circumstance
her
lips
were
sealed
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
question
her
further
regarding
Woodroffe
,
of
what
profession
he
followed
and
of
his
past
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
evidently
suspected
me
,
for
I
had
unfortunately
mentioned
the
_
Lola
_
.
 
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
speak
to
me
in
confidence
,
and
yet
she
would
reveal
to
me
nothing
--
absolutely
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
Woodroffe
did
not
rejoin
the
house
-
party
at
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
Although
I
remained
the
guest
of
my
uncle
much
longer
than
I
intended
,
indeed
right
through
the
shooting
season
,
in
order
to
watch
the
Leithcourts
,
yet
as
far
as
we
could
judge
they
were
extremely
well
-
bred
people
and
very
hospitable
.
 
<EOS>
We
exchanged
a
good
many
visits
and
dinners
,
and
while
my
uncle
several
times
invited
Leithcourt
and
his
friends
to
his
shoot
with
_
al
fresco
_
luncheon
,
which
the
ladies
joined
,
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
always
invited
us
back
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
I
gained
many
opportunities
of
talking
with
Muriel
,
and
of
watching
her
closely
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
confirmed
bachelor
,
and
on
account
of
that
it
seemed
that
she
was
in
no
way
averse
to
my
companionship
.
<EOS>
She
could
handle
a
rook
-
rifle
as
well
as
any
woman
,
and
was
really
a
very
fair
shot
.
<EOS>
Therefore
we
often
found
ourselves
alone
tramping
across
the
wide
open
moorland
,
or
along
those
delightful
glens
of
the
Nithsdale
,
glorious
in
the
autumn
tints
of
their
luxurious
foliage
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
,
on
the
other
hand
,
seemed
to
view
me
with
considerable
suspicion
,
and
I
could
easily
discern
that
I
was
only
asked
to
Rannoch
because
it
was
impossible
to
invite
my
uncle
without
including
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Leithcourt
,
who
perhaps
thought
I
was
courting
his
daughter
,
was
ever
endeavoring
to
avoid
me
,
and
would
never
allow
me
to
walk
with
him
alone
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
I
wondered
.
<EOS>
Did
he
fear
me
?
<EOS>
Had
Woodroffe
told
him
of
our
strange
encounter
in
Leghorn
?
 
<EOS>
His
pronounced
antipathy
towards
me
caused
me
to
watch
him
surreptitiously
,
and
more
closely
than
perhaps
I
should
otherwise
have
done
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
gloomy
mood
,
and
often
he
would
leave
his
guests
and
take
walks
alone
,
musing
and
brooding
.
<EOS>
On
several
occasions
I
followed
him
in
secret
,
and
found
to
my
surprise
that
although
he
made
long
detours
in
various
directions
,
yet
he
always
arrived
at
the
same
spot
at
the
same
hour
--
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
where
he
halted
was
on
the
edge
of
a
dark
wood
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
about
three
miles
from
Rannoch
--
a
good
place
to
get
woodpigeon
,
as
they
came
to
roost
.
<EOS>
It
was
fully
two
miles
across
the
hills
from
the
high
road
to
Moniaive
,
and
from
the
break
the
gray
wall
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
sitting
to
rest
and
smoke
,
there
stretched
the
beautiful
panorama
of
Loch
Urr
and
the
heatherclad
hills
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
Leithcourt
never
went
direct
to
the
place
,
but
always
so
timed
his
walks
that
he
arrived
just
at
five
,
and
remained
there
smoking
cigarettes
until
half
-
past
,
as
though
awaiting
the
arrival
of
some
person
he
expected
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
his
guests
suggested
shooting
pigeons
at
sundown
,
but
he
always
had
some
excuse
for
opposing
the
proposal
,
and
thus
the
party
,
unsuspecting
the
reason
,
were
kept
away
from
that
particular
lonely
spot
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
youth
I
had
sat
many
a
quiet
hour
there
in
the
darkening
gloom
and
shot
many
a
pigeon
,
therefore
I
knew
the
wood
well
,
and
was
able
to
watch
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
from
points
where
he
least
suspected
the
presence
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
when
I
was
alone
with
Muriel
,
I
mentioned
her
father
's
capacity
for
walking
alone
,
<EOS>
whereupon
she
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
he
was
always
fond
of
walking
.
<EOS>
He
used
to
take
me
with
him
when
we
first
came
here
,
but
he
always
went
so
far
that
I
refused
to
go
any
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
never
once
mentioned
Woodroffe
.
<EOS>
I
allowed
her
plenty
of
opportunity
for
doing
so
,
chaffing
her
about
her
forthcoming
marriage
in
order
that
she
might
again
refer
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
never
did
his
name
pass
her
lips
.
<EOS>
I
understood
that
he
had
gone
abroad
--
that
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
Often
when
alone
I
reflected
upon
my
curious
adventure
on
that
night
when
I
met
Olinto
,
and
of
my
narrow
escape
from
the
hands
of
my
unknown
enemies
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
if
that
ingenious
and
dastardly
attempt
upon
my
life
had
really
any
connection
with
that
strange
incident
at
Leghorn
.
<EOS>
As
day
succeeded
day
,
my
mind
became
filled
by
increasing
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Mystery
surrounded
me
on
every
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
by
one
curious
fact
alone
it
was
increased
a
hundredfold
.
 
<EOS>
Late
one
afternoon
,
when
I
had
been
out
shooting
all
day
with
the
Rannoch
party
,
I
drove
back
to
the
castle
in
the
Perth
-
cart
with
three
other
men
,
and
found
the
ladies
assembled
in
the
great
hall
with
tea
ready
.
<EOS>
A
welcome
log
-
fire
was
blazing
in
the
huge
old
grate
,
for
in
October
it
is
chilly
and
damp
in
Scotland
and
a
fire
is
pleasant
at
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Muriel
was
seated
upon
the
high
padded
fender
--
like
those
one
has
at
clubs
--
which
always
formed
a
cosy
spot
for
the
ladies
,
especially
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
When
I
entered
,
she
rose
quickly
and
handed
me
my
cup
,
exclaiming
as
she
looked
at
me--
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Gregg
!
<EOS>
what
a
state
you
are
in
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
was
after
snipe
,
and
slipped
into
a
bog
,
"
I
laughed
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
was
early
this
morning
,
and
the
mud
has
dried
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
and
I
'll
get
you
a
brush
,
"
she
urged
.
<EOS>
And
I
followed
her
through
the
long
corridors
and
upstairs
to
a
small
sitting
-
room
which
was
her
own
little
sanctum
,
where
she
worked
and
read
--
a
cosy
little
place
with
two
queer
old
windows
in
the
colossal
wall
,
and
a
floor
of
polished
oak
,
and
great
black
beams
above
.
<EOS>
When
the
owner
had
occupied
the
house
that
room
had
been
disused
,
but
it
had
,
I
found
,
been
now
completely
transformed
,
and
was
a
most
tasteful
little
nest
of
luxury
with
its
bright
chintzes
,
its
Turkey
rugs
and
its
cheerful
fire
on
the
old
stone
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
She
laughed
when
I
expressed
admiration
of
her
little
den
,
and
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
was
the
armory
in
the
old
days
.
<EOS>
But
it
makes
quite
a
comfy
little
boudoir
.
<EOS>
I
can
lock
myself
in
and
be
quite
quiet
when
the
party
are
too
noisy
,
"
she
added
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
my
eyes
wandered
around
they
suddenly
fell
upon
an
object
which
caused
me
to
start
with
profound
wonder
--
a
cabinet
photograph
in
a
frame
of
crimson
leather
.
 
<EOS>
The
picture
was
that
of
a
young
girl
--
a
duplicate
of
the
portrait
I
had
found
torn
across
and
flung
aside
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
!
 
<EOS>
The
merry
eyes
laughed
out
at
me
as
I
stood
staring
at
it
in
sheer
bewilderment
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
pretty
girl
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
quickly
,
concealing
my
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
My
companion
was
silent
a
moment
,
her
dark
eyes
meeting
mine
with
a
strange
look
of
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
laughed
,
"
everyone
admires
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
schoolfellow
of
mine
--
Elma
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heath
!
"
<EOS>
I
echoed
.
<EOS>
"
Where
was
she
at
school
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
Chichester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Long
ago
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
little
over
two
years
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
very
beautiful
!
<EOS>
"
I
declared
,
taking
up
the
photograph
and
discovering
that
it
bore
the
name
of
the
same
well
-
known
photographer
in
New
Bond
Street
as
that
I
had
found
on
the
carpet
of
the
_
Lola
_
in
the
Mediterranean
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
She
's
really
prettier
than
her
photograph
.
<EOS>
It
hardly
does
her
justice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
where
is
she
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
so
very
inquisitive
,
Mr.
Gregg
?
<EOS>
"
laughed
the
handsome
girl
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
actually
fallen
in
love
with
her
from
her
picture
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
hardly
given
to
that
kind
of
thing
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
answered
with
mock
severity
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
even
my
worst
enemy
could
call
me
a
flirt
,
could
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
your
due
,
"
she
declared
.
<EOS>
"
You
never
do
flirt
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
I
like
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thanks
for
your
candor
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
,
"
she
added
,
"
you
seem
smitten
with
Elma
's
charms
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
's
extremely
pretty
,
"
I
remarked
,
with
the
photograph
still
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
ever
see
her
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Since
the
day
I
left
school
we
have
never
met
.
<EOS>
She
was
several
years
younger
than
myself
,
and
I
heard
that
a
week
after
I
left
Chichester
<EOS>
her
people
came
and
took
her
away
.
<EOS>
Where
she
is
now
I
have
no
idea
.
<EOS>
Her
people
lived
somewhere
in
Durham
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
a
doctor
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
reply
disappointed
me
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
had
,
at
least
,
retained
knowledge
of
the
name
of
the
original
of
the
picture
,
and
from
the
photographer
I
might
perhaps
discover
her
address
,
for
to
me
<EOS>
it
seemed
that
she
was
somehow
intimately
connected
with
those
mysterious
yachtsmen
.
 
<EOS>
What
Muriel
told
me
concerning
her
,
I
did
not
doubt
for
a
single
instant
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
certainly
more
than
a
coincidence
that
a
copy
of
the
picture
which
had
created
such
a
deep
impression
upon
me
should
be
preserved
in
her
own
little
boudoir
as
a
souvenir
of
a
devoted
school
-
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
heard
absolutely
nothing
as
to
her
present
position
or
whereabouts
--
whether
she
is
married
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
mischievously
.
<EOS>
"
You
betray
yourself
by
your
own
words
.
<EOS>
You
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
,
I
really
believe
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
If
she
knew
,
she
'd
be
most
gratified
--
or
at
least
,
she
ought
to
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
which
I
smiled
,
preferring
that
she
should
adopt
that
theory
in
preference
to
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
frankly
,
as
a
pure
honest
girl
would
speak
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
jealous
,
but
she
nevertheless
resented
--
as
women
do
resent
such
things
--
that
I
should
fall
in
love
with
a
friend
's
photograph
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
mystery
surrounding
that
torn
picture
;
of
that
I
was
absolutely
certain
.
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
that
memorable
evening
when
I
had
dined
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
arose
vividly
before
me
.
<EOS>
Why
had
the
girl
's
portrait
been
so
ruthlessly
destroyed
and
the
frame
turned
with
its
face
to
the
wall
?
<EOS>
There
was
some
reason
--
some
distinct
and
serious
motive
in
it
.
<EOS>
Had
Muriel
told
me
the
truth
,
I
wondered
,
or
was
she
merely
seeking
to
shield
the
suspected
man
who
was
her
lover
?
 
<EOS>
Hour
by
hour
<EOS>
the
mystery
surrounding
the
Leithcourts
became
more
inscrutable
,
more
intensely
absorbing
.
<EOS>
I
had
searched
a
copy
of
the
London
Directory
at
the
Station
Hotel
at
Carlisle
,
and
found
that
no
house
in
Green
Street
was
registered
as
occupied
by
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
;
and
,
further
,
when
I
came
to
examine
the
list
of
guests
at
the
castle
,
I
found
that
they
were
really
persons
unknown
in
society
.
<EOS>
They
were
merely
of
that
class
of
witty
,
well
-
dressed
parasites
who
always
cling
on
to
the
wealthy
and
make
believe
that
they
are
smart
and
of
the
_
grande
monde
_
.
<EOS>
Rannoch
was
an
expensive
place
to
keep
up
,
with
all
that
big
retinue
of
servants
and
gamekeepers
,
and
with
those
nightly
dinners
cooked
by
a
French
_
chef
_
;
yet
Leithcourt
seemed
to
possess
a
long
pocket
and
smiled
upon
those
parasites
,
officers
of
doubtful
commission
and
younger
sprigs
of
the
pseudo
-
aristocracy
who
surrounded
him
,
while
his
wife
,
keen
-
eyed
and
of
superb
bearing
,
was
punctilious
concerning
all
points
of
etiquette
,
and
at
the
same
time
indefatigable
that
her
mixed
set
of
guests
should
enjoy
a
really
good
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
not
the
only
person
who
could
not
make
them
out
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
was
the
first
to
open
my
eyes
regarding
the
true
character
of
certain
of
the
men
staying
at
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Gordon
,
that
one
or
two
of
those
fellows
with
Leithcourt
are
rank
outsiders
,
"
he
said
confidentially
to
me
one
night
after
we
had
had
a
hard
day
's
shooting
,
and
were
playing
a
hundred
up
at
billiards
before
retiring
.
"
<EOS>
One
man
,
who
arrived
yesterday
,
I
know
too
well
.
<EOS>
He
was
struck
off
the
list
at
Boodle
's
three
years
ago
for
card
-
sharping
--
that
thin
-
faced
,
fair
-
mustached
man
named
Cadby
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Leithcourt
does
n't
know
it
,
or
he
would
n't
have
him
up
here
among
respectable
folk
.
"
<EOS>
And
my
uncle
,
chewing
the
end
of
his
cigar
,
sniffed
angrily
,
seeming
half
inclined
to
give
his
friend
a
gentle
hint
that
the
name
Cadby
was
placed
beyond
the
pale
of
good
society
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
not
say
anything
about
it
,
"
I
urged
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
Leithcourt
's
own
affair
,
uncle
--
not
ours
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
if
a
man
sets
up
a
position
in
the
country
he
must
n't
be
allowed
to
ask
us
to
meet
such
fellows
.
<EOS>
It
's
coming
it
a
little
too
thick
,
Gordon
.
<EOS>
We
men
can
stand
the
women
of
the
party
,
but
the
men
--
well
,
I
tell
you
candidly
,
I
sha
n't
accept
his
invites
to
shoot
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
uncle
,
"
I
protested
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Probably
it
's
owing
to
ignorance
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
able
,
a
little
later
on
,
to
give
him
valuable
tips
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
good
fellow
,
and
only
wants
experience
in
Scotland
to
get
along
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
like
it
,
my
boy
,
I
do
n't
like
it
!
<EOS>
It
is
n't
playing
a
fair
game
,
"
declared
the
rigid
old
gentleman
,
coloring
resentfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
return
the
invitation
and
ask
that
sharper
,
Cadby
,
to
my
house
--
and
I
tell
you
that
plainly
.
"
 
<EOS>
Next
day
I
shot
with
the
Carmichaels
of
Crossburn
,
and
about
four
o'clock
,
after
a
good
day
,
took
leave
of
the
party
in
the
Black
Glen
,
and
started
off
alone
to
walk
home
,
a
distance
of
about
six
miles
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
growing
dusk
,
and
would
be
quite
dark
,
I
knew
,
before
I
reached
my
uncle
's
house
.
<EOS>
My
most
direct
way
was
to
follow
the
river
for
about
two
miles
and
then
strike
straight
across
the
large
dense
wood
,
and
afterwards
over
a
wide
moor
full
of
treacherous
bogs
and
pitfalls
for
the
unwary
.
 
<EOS>
My
gun
over
my
shoulder
,
I
had
walked
on
for
about
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
,
and
had
nearly
traversed
the
wood
,
at
that
hour
so
dark
that
I
had
considerable
difficulty
in
finding
my
way
,
when
--
of
a
sudden
--
I
fancied
I
distinguished
voices
.
 
<EOS>
I
halted
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Men
were
talking
in
low
tones
of
confidence
,
and
in
that
calm
stillness
of
evening
they
appeared
nearer
to
me
than
they
actually
were
.
 
<EOS>
I
listened
,
trying
to
distinguish
the
words
uttered
,
but
could
make
out
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
were
moving
slowly
together
,
in
close
vicinity
to
myself
,
for
their
feet
stirred
the
dry
leaves
,
and
I
could
hear
the
boughs
cracking
as
they
forced
their
way
through
them
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
sudden
,
while
standing
there
not
daring
to
breathe
<EOS>
lest
I
should
betray
my
presence
,
a
strange
sound
fell
upon
my
eager
ears
.
 
<EOS>
Next
moment
I
realized
that
I
was
at
that
place
where
Leithcourt
so
persistently
kept
his
disappointed
tryst
,
having
approached
it
from
within
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
The
sound
alarmed
me
,
and
yet
it
was
neither
an
explosion
of
fire
-
arms
nor
a
startling
cry
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
One
word
reached
me
in
the
darkness
--
one
single
word
of
bitter
and
withering
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
Heedless
of
the
risk
I
ran
and
the
peril
to
which
I
exposed
myself
,
I
dashed
forward
with
a
resolve
to
penetrate
the
mystery
,
until
I
came
to
the
gap
in
the
rough
stone
wall
where
Leithcourt
's
habit
was
to
halt
each
day
at
sundown
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
in
the
falling
darkness
,
the
sight
that
met
my
eyes
at
the
spot
held
me
rigid
,
appalled
,
stupefied
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
instant
I
realized
the
truth
--
a
truth
that
was
surely
the
strangest
ever
revealed
to
any
man
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
V
 
<EOS>
CONTAINS
CERTAIN
<EOS>
CONFIDENCES
  
<EOS>
As
I
dashed
forward
to
the
gap
in
the
boundary
wall
of
the
wood
,
I
nearly
stumbled
over
a
form
lying
across
the
narrow
path
.
 
<EOS>
So
dark
was
it
beneath
the
trees
that
at
first
I
could
not
plainly
make
out
what
it
was
until
I
bent
and
my
hands
touched
the
garments
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
hat
had
fallen
off
,
for
I
felt
it
beneath
my
feet
,
while
the
cloak
was
a
thick
woolen
one
.
 
<EOS>
Was
she
dead
<EOS>
,
I
wondered
?
<EOS>
That
cry
--
that
single
word
of
reproach
--
sounded
in
my
ears
,
and
it
seemed
plain
that
she
had
been
struck
down
ruthlessly
after
an
exchange
of
angry
words
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
in
my
pocket
for
my
vestas
,
but
unfortunately
my
box
was
empty
.
<EOS>
Yet
just
at
that
moment
my
strained
ears
caught
a
sound
--
the
sound
of
someone
moving
stealthily
among
the
fallen
leaves
.
<EOS>
Seizing
my
gun
,
I
demanded
who
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
no
response
.
<EOS>
The
instant
I
spoke
the
movement
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
could
judge
,
the
person
in
concealment
was
within
the
wood
about
ten
yards
from
me
,
separated
by
an
impenetrable
thicket
.
<EOS>
As
,
however
,
I
stood
out
against
the
sky
,
my
silhouette
was
,
I
knew
,
a
well
-
defined
mark
for
anyone
with
fire
-
arms
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
evident
that
a
tragedy
had
occurred
,
and
that
the
victim
at
my
feet
was
a
woman
.
<EOS>
But
whom
?
 
<EOS>
Of
a
sudden
,
while
I
stood
hesitating
,
blaming
myself
for
being
without
matches
,
I
heard
the
movement
repeated
.
<EOS>
Someone
was
quickly
receding
--
escaping
from
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
listened
again
.
<EOS>
The
sound
was
not
of
the
rustling
of
leaves
or
the
crackling
of
dried
sticks
,
but
the
low
thuds
of
a
man
's
feet
racing
over
softer
ground
.
<EOS>
He
had
scaled
the
rough
stone
dyke
and
was
out
in
the
turnip
-
field
adjacent
.
 
<EOS>
I
sprang
through
the
gap
,
straining
my
eyes
into
the
gloom
,
and
as
I
did
so
could
just
distinguish
a
dark
figure
receding
quickly
beneath
the
wall
of
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
I
dashed
after
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
agility
of
whoever
the
fugitive
was
,
man
or
woman
,
was
marvelous
.
<EOS>
I
considered
myself
a
fairly
good
runner
,
but
racing
across
those
rough
turnips
and
heavy
,
newly
-
plowed
land
in
the
darkness
and
carrying
my
gun
soon
caused
me
to
pant
and
blow
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
figure
I
was
pursuing
was
so
fleet
of
foot
and
so
nimble
in
climbing
the
high
rough
walls
that
from
the
very
first
I
was
outrun
.
 
<EOS>
Down
the
steep
hill
to
the
Scarwater
<EOS>
I
followed
the
fugitive
,
crossing
the
old
footbridge
near
Penpont
,
and
then
up
a
wild
winding
glen
towards
the
Cairnsmore
of
Deugh
.
<EOS>
For
a
couple
of
miles
or
more
I
was
close
behind
,
until
,
at
a
turn
in
the
dark
wooded
glen
where
it
branched
in
two
directions
,
I
lost
all
trace
of
the
person
who
flew
from
me
.
<EOS>
Whoever
it
was
they
had
very
cleverly
gone
into
hiding
in
the
undergrowth
of
one
or
other
of
the
two
glens
--
which
I
could
not
decide
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
out
of
breath
,
the
perspiration
pouring
from
me
,
undecided
how
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
Was
<EOS>
it
Leithcourt
himself
whom
I
had
surprised
?
 
<EOS>
That
idea
somehow
became
impressed
upon
me
and
I
suddenly
resolved
to
go
boldly
across
to
Rannoch
and
ascertain
for
myself
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
with
the
excuse
that
I
was
belated
on
my
walk
home
,
I
turned
back
down
the
glen
,
and
half
an
hour
afterward
entered
the
great
well
-
lighted
hall
of
the
castle
where
the
guests
,
ready
dressed
,
were
assembling
prior
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
welcomed
warmly
,
as
I
was
always
by
the
men
of
the
party
,
who
seeing
my
muddy
plight
at
once
offered
me
a
glass
of
the
sportsman
's
drink
in
Scotland
,
and
while
I
was
adding
soda
to
it
<EOS>
Leithcourt
himself
joined
his
guests
,
ready
dressed
in
his
dinner
jacket
,
having
just
descended
from
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
,
Gregg
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
heartily
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Had
a
long
day
of
it
,
evidently
.
<EOS>
Good
sport
with
Carmichael
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
fair
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
remained
longer
with
him
than
I
ought
to
have
done
,
and
have
got
belated
on
my
way
home
,
so
looked
in
for
a
refresher
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
"
he
laughed
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
always
welcome
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
'd
have
been
annoyed
if
I
knew
you
had
passed
without
coming
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
Muriel
,
a
pretty
figure
in
a
low
-
cut
gown
of
turquoise
chiffon
,
standing
behind
her
father
,
smiled
secretly
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
smiled
at
her
in
return
,
but
it
was
a
strange
smile
,
I
fear
,
for
with
the
knowledge
of
that
additional
mystery
within
me
--
the
mystery
of
the
woman
lying
unconscious
or
perhaps
dead
,
up
in
the
wood
--
held
me
stupefied
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
suspected
Leithcourt
because
of
his
constant
trysts
at
that
spot
,
but
I
had
at
least
proved
that
my
suspicions
were
entirely
without
foundation
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
got
home
and
dressed
in
the
time
,
for
I
had
taken
the
nearest
route
to
the
castle
while
the
fugitive
would
be
compelled
to
make
a
wide
detour
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
remained
a
few
minutes
,
then
went
forth
into
the
darkness
again
,
utterly
undecided
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
was
to
return
to
the
woman
's
aid
,
for
she
might
not
be
dead
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
when
I
recollected
that
hoarse
cry
that
rang
out
in
the
darkness
,
I
knew
too
well
that
she
had
been
struck
fatally
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
latter
conviction
that
prevented
me
from
turning
back
to
the
wood
.
<EOS>
You
will
perhaps
blame
me
,
but
the
fact
is
I
feared
that
if
I
went
there
suspicion
might
fall
upon
me
,
now
that
the
real
culprit
had
so
ingeniously
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
victim
were
dead
,
what
aid
could
I
render
?
<EOS>
A
knife
had
,
I
believed
,
been
used
,
for
my
foot
caught
against
it
when
I
had
started
off
after
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
The
only
doubt
in
my
own
mind
was
whether
the
unfortunate
woman
was
actually
dead
,
for
if
she
were
not
then
my
disinclination
to
return
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
was
culpable
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
or
not
I
acted
rightly
in
remaining
away
from
the
place
,
I
leave
it
to
you
to
judge
in
the
light
of
the
amazing
truth
which
afterwards
transpired
.
 
<EOS>
I
decided
to
walk
straight
back
to
my
uncle
's
,
and
dinner
was
over
before
I
had
had
my
tub
and
dressed
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
ate
my
meal
alone
,
Davis
,
the
grave
old
butler
,
serving
me
with
that
stateliness
which
always
amused
me
.
<EOS>
I
usually
chatted
with
him
when
others
were
not
present
,
but
that
night
I
remained
silent
,
my
mind
full
of
that
strange
and
startling
affair
of
which
I
alone
held
secret
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
the
body
would
surely
be
found
;
then
the
whole
countryside
would
be
filled
with
horror
and
surprise
.
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
Leithcourt
,
that
calm
,
well
-
groomed
,
distinguished
-
looking
man
,
held
any
knowledge
of
the
ghastly
truth
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
His
manner
as
he
stood
in
the
hall
chatting
gayly
with
me
was
surely
not
that
of
a
man
with
a
guilty
secret
.
<EOS>
I
became
firmly
convinced
<EOS>
that
although
the
tragedy
affected
him
very
closely
,
and
that
it
had
occurred
at
the
spot
which
he
had
each
day
visited
for
some
mysterious
purpose
,
yet
up
to
the
present
he
was
in
ignorance
of
what
had
transpired
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
was
the
woman
?
<EOS>
Was
she
young
or
old
?
 
<EOS>
A
thousand
times
I
regretted
bitterly
that
I
had
no
matches
with
me
so
that
I
might
examine
her
features
.
 
<EOS>
One
sudden
thought
that
struck
me
as
I
sat
there
at
table
caused
me
to
lay
down
my
fork
and
pause
in
breathless
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
Was
the
victim
that
sweet
-
faced
young
girl
whose
photograph
had
been
so
ruthlessly
cast
from
its
frame
and
destroyed
?
<EOS>
The
theory
was
a
weird
one
,
but
was
it
the
truth
?
 
<EOS>
I
longed
for
the
coming
of
the
dawn
when
the
Rannoch
keepers
would
most
certainly
discover
her
.
<EOS>
Then
at
least
I
should
know
the
truth
,
for
I
might
go
and
see
the
body
out
of
curiosity
without
arousing
any
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
play
my
usual
game
of
billiards
with
my
uncle
,
but
my
hand
was
so
unsteady
that
the
old
gentleman
began
to
chaff
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
gun
,
I
suppose
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
carrying
it
all
day
,
and
am
tired
out
.
<EOS>
I
walked
all
the
way
home
from
Crossburn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Carmichaels
are
very
thick
with
the
Leithcourts
,
I
hear
,
"
my
uncle
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Strange
they
did
n't
ask
Leithcourt
to
their
shoot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
did
,
but
he
'd
got
another
engagement
--
over
at
Kenmure
Castle
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
retired
to
my
room
that
night
full
of
fevered
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Had
I
acted
rightly
in
not
returning
to
that
lonely
spot
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
?
<EOS>
Had
I
done
as
a
man
should
do
in
keeping
the
tragic
secret
to
myself
?
 
<EOS>
I
opened
my
window
and
gazed
away
across
the
dark
Nithsdale
,
where
,
in
the
distant
gloom
,
the
black
line
of
wood
loomed
up
against
the
stormy
sky
.
<EOS>
The
stars
were
no
longer
shining
and
the
rain
clouds
had
gathered
.
<EOS>
I
stood
with
my
face
turned
to
the
dark
indistinct
spot
that
held
the
secret
,
lost
in
wonderment
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
closed
the
window
and
turned
in
,
but
no
sleep
came
to
my
eyes
,
so
full
was
my
mind
of
the
startling
events
of
those
past
few
months
and
of
that
gruesome
discovery
I
had
made
.
 
<EOS>
Had
the
fugitive
actually
recognized
me
?
<EOS>
Probably
my
voice
when
I
had
called
out
had
betrayed
me
.
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
I
lay
puzzling
,
trying
to
arrive
at
some
solution
of
that
intricate
problem
which
now
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
Muriel
could
tell
me
what
I
wished
to
know
.
<EOS>
Of
that
I
was
certain
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
dared
not
speak
.
<EOS>
Some
inexpressible
terror
held
her
dumb
--
she
was
affianced
to
the
man
Martin
Woodroffe
.
 
<EOS>
Again
I
rose
,
lit
the
gas
,
and
tried
to
read
a
novel
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
concentrate
my
thoughts
,
which
were
ever
wandering
to
that
strange
mystery
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
At
six
I
shaved
,
descended
,
and
went
out
with
the
dogs
for
a
short
walk
;
but
on
returning
I
heard
of
nothing
unusual
,
and
was
compelled
to
remain
inactive
until
near
mid
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
crossing
the
stable
-
yard
where
I
had
gone
to
order
the
carriage
for
my
aunt
,
when
an
English
groom
,
suddenly
emerging
from
the
harness
-
room
,
touched
his
cap
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
'
eard
,
sir
,
of
the
awful
affair
up
yonder
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
what
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
there
seems
to
have
been
a
murder
last
night
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
"
said
the
man
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Holden
,
the
gardener
,
has
just
come
back
from
that
village
and
says
that
Mr.
Leithcourt
's
under
-
gamekeeper
as
he
was
going
home
at
five
this
morning
came
upon
a
dead
body
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
dead
body
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
feigning
great
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
--
a
youngish
man
.
<EOS>
He
'd
been
stabbed
to
the
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
--
so
Holden
says
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Call
Holden
.
<EOS>
I
'd
like
to
know
all
he
's
heard
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
And
presently
,
when
the
gardener
emerged
from
the
grape
-
house
,
I
sought
of
him
all
the
particulars
he
had
gathered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
very
much
,
sir
,
"
was
the
man
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
went
into
the
inn
for
a
glass
of
beer
at
eleven
,
as
I
always
do
,
and
heard
them
talking
about
it
.
<EOS>
A
young
man
was
murdered
last
night
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
.
<EOS>
The
gamekeeper
thought
at
first
there
'd
been
a
fight
among
poachers
,
but
from
the
dead
man
's
clothes
they
say
he
is
n't
a
poacher
at
all
,
but
a
stranger
in
this
district
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
body
was
that
of
a
man
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
trying
to
conceal
my
utter
bewilderment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
--
about
thirty
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
The
police
have
taken
him
to
the
mortuary
at
Dumfries
,
and
the
detectives
are
up
there
now
looking
at
the
spot
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
man
!
<EOS>
And
yet
the
body
I
found
was
that
of
a
woman
--
that
I
could
swear
.
 
<EOS>
After
lunch
I
took
the
dog
-
cart
and
drove
alone
into
Dumfries
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
inquired
of
the
police
-
constable
on
duty
at
the
town
mortuary
to
be
allowed
to
view
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
,
he
regarded
me
,
I
thought
,
with
considerable
suspicion
.
<EOS>
My
request
was
an
unusual
one
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
took
me
up
a
narrow
alley
,
unlocked
a
door
,
and
I
found
myself
in
the
cold
,
gloomy
chamber
of
death
.
<EOS>
From
a
small
dingy
window
above
the
light
fell
upon
an
object
lying
upon
a
large
slab
of
gray
stone
and
covered
with
a
soiled
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
was
ghastly
and
gruesome
;
the
body
lay
there
awaiting
the
official
inquiry
into
the
cause
of
death
.
<EOS>
The
silence
of
the
tomb
was
unbroken
,
save
for
the
heavy
tread
of
the
policeman
,
who
having
removed
his
helmet
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
,
lifted
the
end
of
the
sheet
,
revealing
to
me
a
white
,
hard
-
set
face
,
with
closed
eyes
and
dropped
jaw
.
 
<EOS>
I
started
back
as
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
dead
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
was
entirely
unprepared
for
such
a
revelation
.
<EOS>
The
truth
staggered
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
victim
was
the
man
who
had
acted
as
my
friend
--
the
Italian
waiter
,
Olinto
.
 
<EOS>
I
advanced
and
peered
into
the
thin
inanimate
features
,
scarce
able
to
realize
the
actual
fact
.
<EOS>
But
my
eyes
had
not
deceived
me
.
<EOS>
Though
death
distorts
the
facial
expression
of
every
man
,
I
had
no
difficulty
in
identifying
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
recognize
him
,
sir
?
"
remarked
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
he
?
<EOS>
Our
people
are
very
anxious
to
know
,
for
up
to
the
present
moment
they
have
n't
succeeded
in
establishing
his
identity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
bit
my
lips
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
an
arrant
fool
to
betray
myself
before
that
man
.
<EOS>
Yet
having
done
so
,
I
saw
that
any
attempt
to
conceal
my
knowledge
must
of
necessity
reflect
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
your
inspector
,
"
I
answered
with
as
much
calmness
as
I
could
muster
.
<EOS>
"
Where
has
the
poor
fellow
been
wounded
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Through
the
heart
,
"
responded
the
constable
,
as
turning
the
sheet
further
down
<EOS>
he
showed
me
the
small
knife
wound
which
had
penetrated
the
victim
's
jacket
and
vest
full
in
the
chest
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
weapon
,
"
he
added
,
taking
from
a
shelf
close
by
a
long
,
thin
poignard
with
an
ivory
handle
,
which
he
handed
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
I
recognized
what
it
was
,
and
how
deadly
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
Florentine
_
misericordia
_
,
a
long
thin
,
triangular
blade
,
a
quarter
of
an
inch
wide
at
its
greatest
width
,
tapering
to
a
needle
-
point
,
with
a
hilt
of
yellow
ivory
,
the
most
deadly
and
fatal
of
all
the
daggers
and
poignards
of
the
Middle
Ages
.
<EOS>
The
blade
being
sharp
on
three
angles
produced
a
wound
that
caused
internal
hemorrhage
and
which
never
healed
--
hence
the
name
given
to
it
by
the
Florentines
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
still
blood
-
stained
,
but
as
I
took
the
deadly
thing
in
my
hand
I
saw
that
its
blade
was
beautifully
damascened
,
a
most
elegant
specimen
of
a
medieval
arm
.
<EOS>
Yet
surely
none
but
an
Italian
would
use
such
a
weapon
,
or
would
aim
so
truly
as
to
penetrate
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
the
person
struck
down
was
a
woman
,
and
not
a
man
!
 
<EOS>
A
wound
from
a
_
misericordia
_
always
proves
fatal
,
because
the
shape
of
the
blade
cuts
the
flesh
into
little
flaps
which
,
on
withdrawing
the
knife
,
close
up
and
prevent
the
blood
from
issuing
forth
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
however
,
no
power
can
make
them
heal
again
.
<EOS>
A
blow
from
such
a
weapon
is
as
surely
fatal
as
the
poisoned
poignard
of
the
Borgia
or
the
Medici
.
 
<EOS>
I
handed
the
stiletto
back
to
the
man
without
comment
.
<EOS>
My
resolve
was
to
say
as
little
as
possible
,
for
I
had
no
desire
to
figure
publicly
at
the
inquiry
,
and
consequently
negative
all
my
own
efforts
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
Leithcourts
and
of
Martin
Woodroffe
.
 
<EOS>
I
returned
to
where
the
figure
was
lying
so
ghastly
and
motionless
,
and
looked
again
for
the
last
time
upon
the
dead
face
of
the
man
who
had
served
me
so
well
,
and
yet
who
had
enticed
me
so
nearly
to
my
death
.
<EOS>
In
the
latter
incident
there
was
a
deep
mystery
.
<EOS>
He
had
relented
at
the
last
moment
,
just
in
time
to
save
me
from
my
secret
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
my
enemies
were
his
?
<EOS>
Had
he
fallen
a
victim
by
the
same
hand
that
had
attempted
so
ingeniously
to
kill
me
?
 
<EOS>
Why
had
Leithcourt
gone
so
regularly
up
to
Rannoch
Wood
?
<EOS>
Was
it
in
order
to
meet
the
man
who
was
to
be
entrapped
and
killed
?
<EOS>
What
was
Olinto
Santini
doing
so
far
from
London
,
if
he
had
not
come
expressly
to
meet
someone
in
secret
?
 
<EOS>
As
I
glanced
down
at
the
cold
,
inanimate
countenance
upon
which
mystery
was
written
,
I
became
seized
by
regret
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
faithful
and
honest
servant
,
and
even
though
he
had
enticed
me
to
that
fatal
house
in
Lambeth
,
yet
I
recollected
his
words
,
how
he
had
done
so
under
compulsion
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
,
too
,
how
he
had
implored
me
not
to
prejudge
him
before
I
became
aware
of
the
full
facts
.
 
<EOS>
With
my
own
hand
I
re
-
covered
the
face
with
the
sheet
,
and
inwardly
resolved
to
avenge
the
dastardly
crime
.
 
<EOS>
I
regretted
that
I
was
compelled
to
reveal
the
dead
man
's
name
to
the
police
,
yet
I
saw
that
to
make
some
statement
was
now
inevitable
,
and
therefore
I
accompanied
the
constable
to
the
inspector
's
office
some
distance
across
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
Having
been
introduced
to
the
big
,
fair
-
haired
man
in
a
rough
tweed
suit
,
who
was
apparently
directing
the
inquiries
into
the
affair
,
he
took
me
eagerly
into
a
small
back
room
and
began
to
question
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
,
however
,
wary
not
to
commit
myself
to
anything
further
than
the
identification
of
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
"
I
said
confidentially
,
"
you
must
omit
me
from
the
witnesses
at
the
inquest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
detective
suspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
if
it
were
known
that
I
have
identified
him
,
all
chance
of
getting
at
the
truth
will
at
once
vanish
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
to
tell
you
in
strictest
confidence
who
the
poor
fellow
really
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
know
something
of
the
affair
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
with
a
strong
Highland
accent
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
,
"
I
declared
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
except
his
name
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
H'm
.
<EOS>
And
you
say
he
's
a
foreigner
--
an
Italian
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
in
my
service
in
Leghorn
for
several
years
,
and
on
leaving
me
he
came
to
London
and
obtained
an
engagement
as
waiter
in
a
restaurant
.
<EOS>
His
father
lived
in
Leghorn
;
he
was
doorkeeper
at
the
Prefecture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
was
he
here
,
in
Scotland
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
tell
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
something
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
I
mean
that
you
suspect
somebody
,
or
you
would
have
no
objection
to
giving
evidence
at
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
suspicions
.
<EOS>
To
me
the
affair
is
just
as
much
of
an
enigma
as
to
you
,
<EOS>
"
I
hastened
at
once
to
explain
.
<EOS>
"
My
only
fear
is
that
if
the
assassin
knew
that
I
had
identified
him
he
would
take
care
not
to
betray
himself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
therefore
think
he
will
betray
himself
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
fact
that
the
man
was
attacked
with
an
Italian
stiletto
,
it
would
seem
that
his
assailant
was
a
fellow
-
countryman
,
"
suggested
the
detective
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
evidence
certainly
points
to
that
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
happen
to
be
aware
of
anyone
--
any
foreigner
,
I
mean
--
who
was
,
or
might
be
his
enemy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
responded
in
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
these
foreigners
are
always
fighting
among
themselves
and
using
knives
.
<EOS>
I
did
ten
years
'
service
in
Edinburgh
and
made
lots
of
arrests
for
stabbing
affrays
.
<EOS>
Italians
,
like
Greeks
,
are
a
dangerous
lot
when
their
blood
is
up
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
added
:
"
Personally
,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
murdered
man
was
enticed
from
London
to
that
spot
and
coolly
done
away
with
--
from
some
motive
of
revenge
,
most
probably
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
probably
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
A
vendetta
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
live
in
Italy
,
and
therefore
know
the
Italians
well
,
"
I
added
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
given
him
my
card
,
and
told
him
with
whom
I
was
staying
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
were
you
yesterday
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
presently
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
shooting
--
on
the
other
side
of
the
Nithsdale
,
"
I
answered
,
and
then
went
on
to
explain
my
movements
,
without
,
however
,
mentioning
my
visit
to
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
although
you
know
the
murdered
man
so
intimately
,
you
have
no
suspicion
of
anyone
in
this
district
who
was
acquainted
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
one
who
knew
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
left
my
service
he
had
never
been
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
he
was
engaged
in
service
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
at
a
restaurant
in
Oxford
Street
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
met
him
accidentally
in
Pall
Mall
one
evening
,
and
he
told
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
the
name
of
the
restaurant
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
tell
me
,
but
unfortunately
I
have
forgotten
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
detective
drew
a
deep
breath
of
regret
.
 
<EOS>
"
Someone
who
waited
for
him
on
the
edge
of
that
wood
stepped
out
and
killed
him
--
that
's
evident
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Without
a
doubt
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
my
belief
is
that
it
was
an
Italian
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
foreigners
who
slept
at
a
common
lodging
-
house
two
nights
ago
and
went
on
tramp
towards
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
We
have
telegraphed
after
them
,
and
hope
we
shall
find
them
.
<EOS>
Scotsmen
or
Englishmen
never
use
a
knife
of
that
pattern
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
his
latter
remark
I
entirely
coincided
.
<EOS>
In
my
own
mind
that
was
the
strongest
argument
in
favor
of
Leithcourt
's
innocence
.
<EOS>
That
the
tenant
of
Rannoch
had
kept
that
secret
tryst
in
daily
patience
I
knew
from
my
own
observations
,
yet
to
me
it
scarcely
seemed
feasible
that
he
would
use
a
weapon
so
peculiarly
Italian
and
yet
so
terribly
deadly
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
when
I
reflected
further
,
recollecting
that
the
body
I
had
discovered
was
that
of
a
woman
and
not
a
man
,
I
stood
staggered
and
bewildered
by
the
utterly
inexplicable
enigma
.
 
<EOS>
I
promised
the
burly
detective
<EOS>
that
in
exchange
for
his
secrecy
regarding
my
statement
that
I
would
assist
him
in
every
manner
possible
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
real
name
of
the
murdered
man
must
be
at
all
costs
withheld
,
"
I
urged
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
not
appear
in
the
papers
,
for
I
feel
confident
that
only
by
the
pretense
that
he
is
unknown
can
we
arrive
at
the
truth
.
<EOS>
If
his
name
is
given
at
the
inquiry
,
then
the
assassin
will
certainly
know
that
I
have
identified
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
then
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
with
some
hesitation
,
"
while
I
am
believed
to
be
in
ignorance
we
shall
have
opportunity
for
obtaining
the
truth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
do
really
suspect
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
again
looking
at
me
with
those
cold
,
blue
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
whom
to
suspect
,
"
I
declared
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
mystery
why
the
man
who
was
once
my
faithful
servant
should
be
enticed
to
that
wood
and
stabbed
to
the
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
one
in
the
vicinity
who
knew
him
?
"
 
"
Not
to
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
might
obtain
his
address
in
London
through
his
father
in
Leghorn
,
"
suggested
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
-
day
if
you
so
desire
,
"
I
said
readily
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
will
get
my
friend
the
British
Consul
to
go
round
and
see
the
old
man
and
telegraph
the
address
if
he
obtains
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Capital
!
"
<EOS>
he
declared
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
do
us
this
favor
we
shall
be
greatly
indebted
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
fortunate
that
we
have
established
the
victim
's
identity
--
otherwise
we
might
be
entirely
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
A
murdered
foreigner
is
always
more
or
less
of
a
mystery
.
"
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
then
and
there
,
I
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
to
my
old
friend
Hutcheson
at
Leghorn
,
asking
him
to
make
immediate
inquiry
of
Olinto
's
father
as
to
his
son
's
address
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
to
the
police
of
that
strange
adventure
of
mine
over
in
Lambeth
,
or
of
how
the
man
now
dead
had
saved
my
life
.
<EOS>
That
his
enemies
were
my
own
<EOS>
he
had
most
distinctly
told
me
,
therefore
I
felt
some
apprehension
that
I
myself
was
not
safe
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
my
hip
pocket
I
always
carried
my
revolver
--
just
as
I
did
in
Italy
--
and
I
rather
prided
myself
on
my
ability
to
shoot
straight
.
 
<EOS>
We
sat
for
a
long
time
discussing
the
strange
affair
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
betray
no
eagerness
to
get
away
,
I
offered
the
big
Highlander
a
cigar
from
my
case
,
and
we
smoked
together
.
<EOS>
The
inquiry
would
be
held
on
the
morrow
,
he
told
me
,
but
as
far
as
the
public
was
concerned
the
body
would
remain
as
that
of
some
person
"
unknown
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
had
better
not
come
to
my
uncle
's
house
,
or
send
anyone
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
desire
to
see
me
,
send
me
a
line
<EOS>
and
I
will
meet
you
here
in
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
safer
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
officer
looked
at
me
with
those
keen
eyes
of
his
,
and
said
:
 
"
Really
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
I
ca
n't
quite
make
you
out
,
I
confess
.
<EOS>
You
seem
to
be
apprehensive
of
your
own
safety
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Italians
are
a
very
curious
people
,
"
I
responded
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Their
vendetta
extends
widely
sometimes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
enemy
of
this
poor
fellow
Santini
may
be
your
enemy
also
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
never
knows
whom
one
offends
when
living
in
Italy
,
"
I
laughed
,
as
lightly
as
I
could
,
endeavoring
to
allay
his
suspicion
.
"
<EOS>
He
may
have
fallen
beneath
the
assassin
's
knife
by
giving
quite
a
small
and
possibly
innocent
offense
to
somebody
.
<EOS>
Italian
methods
are
not
English
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
,
sir
,
and
I
'm
jolly
glad
they
're
not
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
think
a
police
officer
's
life
is
a
very
safe
one
among
all
those
secret
murder
societies
I
've
read
about
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
you
read
about
them
is
often
very
much
exaggerated
,
"
I
assured
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
vendetta
which
is
such
a
stain
upon
the
character
of
the
modern
Italian
;
and
depend
upon
it
this
affair
in
Rannoch
Wood
is
the
outcome
of
some
revenge
or
other
--
probably
over
a
love
affair
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
assist
us
,
sir
?
"
he
urged
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
Italian
language
,
which
will
be
of
great
advantage
;
besides
,
the
victim
was
your
servant
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
discreet
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
in
return
I
will
do
my
very
utmost
to
assist
you
in
hunting
down
the
assassin
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
thus
we
made
our
compact
.
<EOS>
Half
-
an
-
hour
after
I
was
driving
in
the
dog
-
cart
through
the
pouring
rain
up
the
hill
out
of
gray
old
Dumfries
to
my
uncle
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
descended
from
the
cart
and
gave
it
over
to
a
groom
,
old
Davis
,
the
butler
,
came
forward
,
saying
in
a
low
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
Miss
Leithcourt
waiting
to
see
you
,
Mr.
Gordon
.
<EOS>
She
's
in
the
morning
-
room
,
and
been
there
an
hour
.
<EOS>
She
asked
me
not
to
tell
anyone
else
<EOS>
she
's
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
my
aunt
has
not
seen
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
scenting
mystery
in
this
unexpected
visit
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
wishes
to
see
you
alone
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
walked
across
the
big
hall
and
along
the
corridor
to
the
room
the
old
man
had
indicated
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
I
opened
the
door
and
Muriel
Leithcourt
in
plain
black
rose
to
meet
me
<EOS>
,
I
plainly
saw
from
her
white
,
haggard
countenance
that
something
had
happened
--
that
she
had
been
forced
by
circumstances
to
come
to
me
in
strictest
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Was
she
<EOS>
,
I
wondered
,
about
to
reveal
to
me
the
truth
?
    
CHAPTER
VI
 
<EOS>
THE
GATHERING
OF
THE
CLOUDS
  
"
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
exclaimed
the
girl
with
agitation
,
as
she
put
forth
her
black
-
gloved
hand
,
"
I
--
I
suppose
you
know
--
you've
heard
all
about
the
discovery
to
-
day
up
at
the
wood
?
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
anything
about
it
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
I
only
wish
you
would
tell
me
about
it
,
"
I
said
gravely
,
inviting
her
to
a
chair
and
seating
myself
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
heard
some
extraordinary
story
about
a
man
being
found
dead
,
but
I
've
been
in
Dumfries
nearly
all
day
.
<EOS>
Who
is
the
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
that
we
do
n't
know
,
"
she
replied
,
pale
-
faced
and
anxious
.
<EOS>
Her
attitude
was
as
though
she
wished
to
confide
in
me
and
yet
still
hesitated
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
waiting
for
me
quite
a
long
time
,
Davis
tells
me
.
<EOS>
I
regret
that
you
should
have
done
this
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
left
word
that
you
wished
to
see
me
,
I
would
have
come
over
to
you
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
I
wanted
to
see
you
alone
--
that
's
the
reason
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
know
at
home
that
I
've
been
over
here
,
so
I
purposely
asked
the
man
not
to
announce
me
to
your
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
see
me
privately
,
"
I
said
in
a
low
,
earnest
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
Is
there
any
service
I
can
render
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
A
very
great
one
,
"
she
responded
with
quick
eagerness
,
"
I
--
<EOS>
well
--
the
fact
is
,
I
have
summoned
courage
to
come
to
you
and
beg
of
you
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
great
distress
--
and
I
have
not
a
single
friend
whom
I
can
trust
--
in
whom
I
can
confide
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
esteem
it
the
highest
honor
if
you
will
trust
me
,
"
I
said
in
deep
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
assure
you
that
I
will
remain
loyal
to
your
interests
and
to
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
believe
you
will
,
Mr.
Gregg
!
<EOS>
"
she
declared
with
enthusiasm
,
her
large
,
dark
eyes
turned
upon
me
--
the
eyes
of
a
woman
in
sheer
and
bitter
despair
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
perfect
,
one
of
the
most
handsome
I
had
ever
gazed
upon
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
saw
of
her
<EOS>
the
greater
was
the
fascination
she
held
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
A
silence
fell
between
us
as
she
sat
with
her
gloved
hands
lying
idly
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
Her
lips
moved
nervously
,
but
no
sound
came
from
them
,
<EOS>
so
agitated
was
she
,
so
eager
to
tell
me
something
;
and
yet
at
the
same
time
reluctant
to
take
me
into
her
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
at
last
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
ready
to
render
you
any
service
,
if
you
will
only
command
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
But
I
fear
what
I
require
will
strike
you
as
so
unusual
--
you
will
hesitate
to
act
when
I
explain
what
service
<EOS>
I
require
of
you
,
"
she
said
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
until
I
hear
your
wishes
,
"
I
said
,
smiling
,
and
yet
puzzled
at
her
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
concerns
the
terrible
discovery
made
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
"
she
said
in
a
hoarse
,
nervous
voice
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
That
unknown
man
was
murdered
--
stabbed
to
the
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
she
said
,
scarcely
above
a
whisper
,
"
I
have
suspicions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
the
murdered
man
's
identity
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
Of
the
assassin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
glanced
at
her
sharply
and
saw
the
intense
look
in
her
dark
,
wide
-
open
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
believe
you
know
who
dealt
the
blow
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
suspicion
--
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
Only
I
want
you
to
help
me
,
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
certainly
,
"
I
responded
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
believe
you
know
the
assassin
you
probably
know
something
of
the
victim
?
"
 
"
Only
that
he
looked
like
a
foreigner
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
seen
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
much
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
My
remark
caused
her
to
hold
her
breath
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Then
she
answered
,
rather
lamely
,
it
seemed
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
when
the
keepers
brought
the
body
to
the
castle
.
"
 
<EOS>
Now
,
according
to
the
account
I
had
heard
,
the
police
had
conveyed
the
dead
man
direct
from
the
wood
into
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
,
therefore
,
that
she
had
seen
Olinto
before
he
met
with
his
sudden
end
?
 
<EOS>
I
feared
to
press
her
for
an
explanation
at
that
moment
,
but
,
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
admission
that
she
had
seen
him
struck
me
as
a
very
peculiar
fact
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
judge
him
to
be
a
foreigner
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
as
casually
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
his
features
and
complexion
I
guessed
him
to
be
Italian
,
"
she
responded
quickly
,
at
which
I
pretended
to
express
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
after
the
keepers
had
found
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
the
stiletto
was
evidently
an
Italian
one
,
which
would
almost
make
it
appear
that
a
foreigner
was
the
assassin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
own
suspicion
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
hesitated
a
moment
,
then
in
a
low
,
eager
voice
she
said
:
 
"
Because
I
have
already
seen
that
three
-
edged
knife
in
another
person
's
possession
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
pretty
strong
evidence
,
"
I
declared
.
<EOS>
"
The
person
in
question
will
have
to
prove
that
he
was
not
in
Rannoch
Wood
last
evening
at
nightfall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
it
was
done
at
nightfall
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
quickly
with
some
surprise
,
half
-
rising
from
her
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
merely
surmised
that
it
was
,
"
I
responded
,
inwardly
blaming
myself
for
my
ill
-
timed
admission
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
with
a
slight
sigh
,
"
there
is
more
mystery
in
this
affair
than
we
have
yet
discovered
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
What
,
I
wonder
,
brought
the
unfortunate
young
man
up
into
our
wood
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
appointment
,
without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
with
whom
?
"
 
She
shook
her
head
,
saying
:
 
"
My
father
often
goes
to
that
spot
to
shoot
pigeon
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
He
told
us
so
at
luncheon
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
How
fortunate
he
was
not
there
last
night
,
or
he
might
be
suspected
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
,
for
it
can
not
be
a
pleasant
experience
to
be
under
suspicion
of
being
an
assassin
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
home
last
night
,
was
he
?
"
<EOS>
I
added
casually
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
recollect
that
when
you
called
he
chatted
with
you
?
<EOS>
I
did
some
typewriting
for
him
in
the
study
,
and
we
were
together
all
the
afternoon
--
or
at
least
till
nearly
five
o'clock
,
when
we
went
out
into
the
hall
to
tea
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
what
is
your
theory
regarding
the
affair
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
rather
puzzled
why
she
should
so
decisively
prove
an
alibi
for
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
certain
that
the
poor
fellow
went
to
the
wood
by
appointment
,
and
was
killed
.
<EOS>
But
have
you
been
up
to
the
spot
since
the
finding
of
the
body
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
Have
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
The
affair
interested
me
,
and
as
soon
as
I
recognized
the
old
Italian
knife
in
the
hand
of
the
keeper
,
I
went
up
there
and
looked
about
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
I
did
so
,
for
I
found
something
which
seems
to
have
escaped
the
notice
of
the
detectives
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
about
three
yards
from
the
pool
of
blood
where
the
unfortunate
foreigner
was
found
is
another
small
pool
of
blood
where
the
grass
and
ferns
around
are
all
crushed
down
as
though
there
had
been
a
struggle
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
may
have
been
a
struggle
at
that
spot
,
and
the
man
may
have
staggered
some
distance
before
he
fell
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
if
he
had
been
struck
in
the
heart
,
as
they
say
.
<EOS>
He
would
fall
,
would
he
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
suggested
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
The
police
seem
very
dense
,
and
this
plain
fact
has
not
yet
occurred
to
them
.
<EOS>
Their
theory
is
the
same
as
what
you
suggest
,
but
my
own
is
something
quite
different
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
a
second
person
also
fell
a
victim
,
"
she
added
in
a
low
,
distinct
tone
.
 
<EOS>
I
gazed
at
her
open
-
mouthed
.
<EOS>
Did
she
,
I
wondered
,
know
the
actual
truth
?
<EOS>
Was
she
aware
that
the
woman
who
had
fallen
there
had
disappeared
?
 
<EOS>
"
A
second
person
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
echoed
,
as
though
in
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
Then
do
you
believe
that
a
double
murder
was
committed
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
draw
my
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
the
young
man
,
on
being
struck
in
the
heart
,
could
not
have
gone
such
a
distance
as
that
which
separates
the
one
mark
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
he
might
have
been
slightly
wounded
--
on
the
hand
,
or
in
the
face
--
at
first
,
and
then
at
the
spot
where
he
was
found
struck
fatally
,
"
I
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
dubiously
,
but
made
no
reply
to
my
argument
.
<EOS>
Her
confidence
in
her
own
surmises
made
it
quite
apparent
that
by
some
unknown
means
she
was
aware
of
the
second
victim
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
a
few
moments
later
she
said
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
for
this
reason
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
that
I
have
sought
you
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
Nobody
must
know
that
I
have
come
here
to
you
,
or
they
would
suspect
;
and
if
suspicion
fell
upon
me
it
would
bring
upon
me
a
fate
worse
than
death
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
therefore
,
that
my
future
is
entirely
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
quite
understand
,
"
I
said
,
rising
and
standing
before
her
in
the
fading
twilight
,
while
the
rain
drove
upon
the
old
diamond
window
panes
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
only
assure
you
that
whatever
confidence
you
repose
in
me
,
I
shall
never
abuse
,
Miss
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
she
said
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
in
this
matter
implicitly
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
you
for
many
reasons
,
<EOS>
chief
of
them
being
that
if
a
second
victim
has
fallen
beneath
the
hand
of
the
assassin
,
it
is
,
I
know
,
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
woman
!
<EOS>
Whom
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
present
I
can
not
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
must
first
establish
the
true
facts
.
<EOS>
If
this
woman
were
really
stricken
down
,
then
her
body
lies
concealed
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
We
must
find
it
and
bring
home
the
crime
to
the
guilty
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
we
succeed
in
finding
it
,
could
we
place
our
hand
upon
the
assassin
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
looking
straight
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
we
find
it
,
the
crime
would
then
tell
its
own
tale
--
it
would
convict
the
person
in
whose
hand
I
have
seen
that
fatal
weapon
,
"
was
her
clear
,
bold
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
wish
me
to
assist
you
in
this
search
,
Miss
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
wondering
if
her
suspicions
rested
upon
that
mysterious
yachtsman
,
Philip
Hornby
,
the
man
to
whom
she
was
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
would
beg
of
you
to
do
your
utmost
in
secret
to
endeavor
to
discover
the
body
of
the
second
victim
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
woman
--
of
that
I
am
certain
.
<EOS>
Find
her
,
and
we
shall
then
be
able
to
bring
the
crime
home
to
the
assassin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
my
search
may
bring
suspicion
upon
me
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
difficult
to
examine
the
whole
wood
without
arousing
the
curiosity
of
somebody
--
the
keeper
or
the
police
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
thought
of
that
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
pretend
to
-
morrow
to
lose
this
watch
-
bracelet
in
the
wood
,
"
and
she
held
up
her
slim
wrist
to
show
me
the
little
enameled
watch
set
in
her
bracelet
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
and
I
will
search
for
it
diligently
,
and
the
police
will
never
suspect
the
real
reason
of
our
investigation
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
shall
write
to
you
telling
you
about
my
loss
,
and
you
will
come
over
to
Rannoch
and
offer
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr.
Woodroffe
back
at
the
castle
?
<EOS>
I
heard
he
was
to
return
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
letter
from
him
from
Bordeaux
a
week
ago
.
<EOS>
He
is
still
on
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
indeed
,
he
has
gone
to
Russia
,
where
he
sometimes
has
business
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
asked
you
the
question
,
Miss
Muriel
,
because
I
thought
if
Mr.
Woodroffe
were
here
,
he
might
object
to
our
searching
in
company
,
"
I
explained
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
flushed
slightly
,
as
though
confused
at
my
reference
to
her
engagement
,
and
she
said
mischievously
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
he
should
object
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
good
enough
to
assist
me
to
search
for
my
bracelet
,
he
surely
ought
to
be
much
obliged
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
explain
to
that
dark
-
eyed
,
handsome
girl
the
circumstances
in
which
I
had
met
her
lover
on
the
sunny
Mediterranean
shore
,
yet
prudence
forbade
me
to
refer
to
the
matter
,
and
I
at
once
gladly
accepted
her
invitation
to
investigate
the
curious
disappearance
of
the
body
of
poor
Olinto
's
fellow
-
victim
.
 
<EOS>
What
secret
knowledge
could
be
possessed
by
that
smart
,
handsome
girl
before
me
?
<EOS>
That
her
suspicions
were
in
the
right
direction
I
felt
confident
,
yet
if
the
dead
woman
had
been
removed
and
hidden
by
the
assassin
it
must
have
been
after
the
discovery
made
by
me
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
must
have
actually
dared
to
return
to
the
spot
and
carry
off
the
victim
.
<EOS>
Yet
if
he
had
actually
done
that
,
why
did
he
allow
the
corpse
of
the
Italian
to
remain
and
await
discovery
?
<EOS>
He
might
perhaps
have
been
disturbed
and
compelled
to
make
good
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
woman
was
really
removed
the
assassin
must
surely
have
had
some
assistance
,
"
I
pointed
out
.
"
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
carried
the
body
very
far
unaided
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
agreed
with
me
,
but
expressed
a
belief
that
the
double
crime
had
been
committed
alone
and
unaided
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
idea
as
to
the
motive
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
her
,
eager
to
hear
her
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
she
answered
hesitatingly
,
"
if
the
woman
has
fallen
a
victim
,
the
motive
will
become
plain
;
but
if
not
,
then
the
matter
must
remain
a
complete
mystery
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
,
Miss
Muriel
,
that
you
suspect
the
truth
,
and
yet
you
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
murdered
man
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
slight
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
"
Until
we
have
cleared
up
the
mystery
of
the
woman
I
can
say
nothing
,
"
was
her
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
tell
you
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
that
if
what
I
suspect
is
true
,
then
the
affair
will
be
found
to
be
one
of
the
strangest
,
most
startling
and
most
ingenious
plots
ever
devised
by
one
man
against
the
life
of
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
a
man
is
the
assassin
,
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
But
even
of
that
I
am
not
at
all
sure
.
<EOS>
We
must
first
find
the
woman
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
so
positive
that
a
woman
had
also
fallen
beneath
that
deadly
_
misericordia
_
that
I
fell
to
wondering
whether
she
,
like
myself
,
had
discovered
the
body
,
and
was
therefore
certain
that
a
second
crime
had
been
committed
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
seek
to
question
her
further
,
lest
her
own
suspicions
might
become
aroused
.
<EOS>
My
own
policy
was
to
remain
silent
and
to
wait
.
<EOS>
The
woman
sitting
before
me
was
herself
a
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
the
rain
had
abated
,
I
told
Davis
to
send
her
trap
a
little
way
up
the
high
-
road
,
so
that
my
aunt
and
uncle
should
not
see
her
departing
;
and
after
helping
her
on
with
her
loose
driving
-
coat
,
we
left
by
one
of
the
servants
'
entrances
,
and
I
saw
her
into
her
high
dog
-
cart
and
stood
bareheaded
in
the
muddy
high
-
road
as
she
drove
away
into
the
gloom
.

Rannoch
Wood
was
already
in
its
gold
-
brown
glory
of
autumn
,
and
as
I
stood
with
Muriel
Leithcourt
on
the
edge
of
it
,
near
the
spot
where
Olinto
Santini
had
fallen
,
the
morning
sun
was
shining
in
a
cloudless
sky
.
 
<EOS>
True
to
her
promise
,
she
had
sent
me
a
note
by
one
of
the
grooms
asking
me
to
help
search
for
her
bracelet
,
and
I
had
driven
over
at
once
to
Rannoch
and
found
her
alone
awaiting
me
.
<EOS>
The
shooting
party
had
gone
over
to
a
distant
part
of
the
estate
,
therefore
we
were
able
to
stroll
together
up
the
hill
and
commence
our
investigations
without
let
or
hindrance
.
<EOS>
She
was
sensibly
dressed
in
a
short
tweed
skirt
,
high
shooting
-
boots
and
a
tam
-
o'-shanter
hat
,
while
I
also
had
on
an
old
shooting
-
suit
and
carried
a
thick
serviceable
stick
with
which
I
could
prod
likely
spots
.
 
<EOS>
On
arrival
at
the
wood
I
asked
her
opinion
which
was
the
most
likely
corner
,
but
she
replied
:
 
"
I
know
so
little
of
this
place
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
You
have
known
it
for
years
,
while
this
is
only
my
first
season
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
place
ourselves
in
the
position
of
the
murderer
,
who
probably
knew
the
wood
and
wished
to
conceal
a
body
in
the
vicinity
without
risk
of
conveying
it
far
.
<EOS>
On
this
,
the
left
side
,
the
wood
has
been
thinned
out
for
nearly
half
a
mile
,
and
therefore
affords
but
little
cover
,
while
here
,
to
the
right
,
it
slopes
down
gently
to
the
valley
and
is
very
thick
and
partly
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
There
can
therefore
have
been
no
two
courses
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
look
for
a
likely
place
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
Let
us
start
here
,
and
first
take
a
small
circle
,
examining
every
bush
carefully
.
<EOS>
The
body
may
have
easily
been
pushed
in
beneath
a
thicket
and
well
escape
observation
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
together
,
after
taking
our
bearings
,
we
started
off
,
working
our
way
into
the
thick
undergrowth
,
beating
with
our
sticks
,
and
making
minute
examination
of
every
bush
or
heap
of
dead
leaves
.
<EOS>
In
parts
,
the
great
spreading
trees
shut
out
the
light
,
rendering
our
investigations
very
difficult
;
but
we
kept
on
,
my
companion
advancing
with
an
eagerness
which
showed
that
the
fact
of
the
woman
's
body
being
there
was
no
mere
surmise
.
 
<EOS>
All
through
the
morning
we
walked
on
,
our
hands
badly
torn
by
brambles
.
<EOS>
Even
Muriel
's
thick
gloves
did
not
wholly
protect
her
,
and
once
when
she
received
a
nasty
scratch
across
the
cheek
,
she
stopped
and
laughingly
exclaimed
:
 
<EOS>
"
Now
what
untruth
must
I
invent
to
account
for
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
My
own
coat
was
badly
torn
,
and
more
than
once
I
was
compelled
to
scramble
through
almost
impassable
thickets
;
yet
we
found
no
trace
of
any
previous
intruder
,
and
having
completed
our
circle
were
compelled
to
admit
that
the
gruesome
evidence
of
the
second
crime
did
not
exist
at
that
spot
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
once
<EOS>
I
felt
half
inclined
to
tell
her
how
I
had
actually
discovered
the
body
of
the
woman
,
yet
on
reflection
I
foresaw
that
in
such
circumstances
silence
was
best
.
<EOS>
If
I
desired
to
solve
the
strange
complicated
enigma
which
had
thus
culminated
in
a
double
crime
,
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
keep
my
own
counsel
and
remain
patient
and
watchful
.
 
<EOS>
When
Hutcheson
replied
from
Leghorn
,
and
when
I
discovered
where
Olinto
was
employed
,
I
might
perhaps
follow
up
the
clues
from
that
end
.
<EOS>
I
might
find
his
wife
Armida
and
learn
something
of
importance
from
her
.
<EOS>
So
I
was
hopeful
,
and
by
reason
of
that
hope
remained
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Muriel
was
untiring
in
her
activity
.
<EOS>
Hither
and
thither
<EOS>
she
went
,
beating
down
the
high
bracken
and
tangles
of
weeds
,
poking
with
her
stick
into
every
hole
and
corner
,
and
going
further
and
further
into
the
wood
in
the
certainty
<EOS>
that
the
body
was
therein
concealed
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
however
,
I
was
not
too
sanguine
of
success
.
<EOS>
The
portion
of
the
wood
which
we
had
already
exhausted
seemed
to
be
the
most
likely
point
.
<EOS>
To
carry
the
body
far
would
require
assistance
,
and
in
my
own
mind
I
believed
the
crime
to
have
been
the
work
of
one
person
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
path
in
the
wood
in
that
direction
,
but
soon
we
came
to
a
deep
wooded
ravine
of
the
existence
of
which
I
was
in
ignorance
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
kind
of
small
glen
through
which
a
rivulet
flowed
,
but
the
banks
were
covered
with
a
thick
impenetrable
undergrowth
out
of
which
sprang
many
fine
old
trees
,
a
place
that
had
apparently
existed
for
centuries
undisturbed
,
for
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
giant
trunk
that
had
decayed
and
fallen
lay
across
the
bank
,
or
had
rolled
into
the
rocky
bed
far
below
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
most
likely
place
,
"
declared
my
dainty
little
companion
as
we
approached
it
.
<EOS>
"
Anything
could
easily
be
concealed
in
that
high
bracken
down
there
.
<EOS>
Let
us
search
the
whole
glen
from
end
to
end
,
"
she
cried
with
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
Acting
upon
her
suggestion
and
without
thought
of
luncheon
,
we
made
a
descent
of
the
steep
bank
until
we
reached
the
rocky
bed
of
the
stream
,
and
<EOS>
then
by
springing
from
stone
to
stone
--
sometimes
slipping
into
the
water
,
be
it
said
--
we
commenced
to
beat
the
bracken
and
carefully
examine
every
bush
.
<EOS>
Progress
was
not
swift
.
<EOS>
Once
the
girl
,
lithe
and
athletic
as
she
was
,
slipped
off
a
mossy
stone
into
a
hole
where
the
water
was
up
to
her
knees
.
<EOS>
But
she
only
laughed
gayly
at
the
accident
,
and
wringing
out
her
wet
skirt
,
said
:
 
"
It
does
n't
matter
in
the
least
,
if
we
only
find
what
we
're
in
search
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
undaunted
,
she
went
on
,
springing
from
stone
to
stone
and
steadying
herself
with
her
stick
.
<EOS>
If
we
could
only
discover
the
body
of
the
dead
woman
,
then
the
rest
would
be
clear
,
she
declared
.
<EOS>
She
would
openly
denounce
the
assassin
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
went
on
I
revolved
within
my
mind
all
the
curious
circumstances
in
connection
with
the
amazing
affair
,
and
recollected
my
old
friend
Jack
Durnford
's
words
when
we
stood
upon
the
quarter
-
deck
of
the
_
Bulwark
_
<EOS>
and
I
had
related
to
him
the
visit
of
the
mysterious
yacht
.
<EOS>
I
too
had
left
one
effort
untried
,
and
I
blamed
myself
for
overlooking
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
sought
of
that
Bond
Street
photographer
the
name
and
address
of
the
original
of
the
photograph
that
had
been
mutilated
and
destroyed
--
that
girl
with
the
magnificent
eyes
that
had
so
attracted
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
afternoon
passed
,
and
yet
we
were
not
successful
.
<EOS>
I
was
faint
with
hunger
and
thirst
,
yet
my
companion
did
not
once
complain
.
<EOS>
Her
energy
was
marvelous
--
and
yet
was
she
not
hunting
down
a
criminal
?
<EOS>
was
she
not
determined
to
obtain
such
evidence
as
would
enable
her
to
speak
the
truth
fearlessly
,
and
with
confidence
that
it
would
have
the
effect
of
convicting
the
guilty
one
?
 
<EOS>
Slowly
we
toiled
on
up
the
picturesque
little
glen
for
nearly
a
mile
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
Its
beauties
were
extraordinary
,
and
the
silence
was
unbroken
save
for
the
musical
ripple
of
the
water
over
the
stones
.
<EOS>
Hidden
there
in
the
center
of
that
great
wood
,
no
one
had
visited
it
perhaps
for
years
,
not
even
the
keepers
,
for
no
path
led
there
,
and
by
reason
of
the
tangle
of
briars
and
bush
it
was
utterly
ungetatable
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
had
ruined
our
clothes
to
search
there
,
and
as
we
went
on
with
so
many
windings
and
turns
we
became
utterly
out
of
our
bearings
.
<EOS>
We
knew
ourselves
to
be
in
the
center
of
the
wood
,
but
that
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
had
set
,
and
the
sky
above
showed
the
crimson
of
the
distant
afterglow
,
warning
us
that
it
was
time
we
began
to
think
of
how
to
make
our
exit
.
<EOS>
We
were
passing
around
a
sharp
bend
in
the
glen
where
the
boulders
were
so
thickly
moss
-
grown
that
our
feet
fell
noiselessly
,
when
I
thought
I
heard
a
voice
,
and
raising
my
hand
we
both
halted
suddenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Someone
is
there
,
"
I
whispered
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Behind
that
rock
.
<EOS>
"
She
nodded
in
the
affirmative
,
for
she
,
too
,
had
heard
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
We
listened
,
but
the
sound
was
not
repeated
.
<EOS>
That
someone
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
rock
I
knew
,
for
in
a
tree
in
the
vicinity
a
thrush
was
hopping
from
twig
to
twig
,
sounding
its
alarm
-
cry
and
objecting
to
being
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
we
crept
silently
forward
together
to
ascertain
who
were
the
intruders
.
<EOS>
The
only
manner
,
however
,
in
which
to
get
a
view
beyond
the
huge
rock
that
,
having
fallen
across
the
stream
centuries
ago
,
had
diverted
its
channel
,
was
to
clamber
up
its
mossy
sides
to
the
summit
.
<EOS>
This
we
did
eagerly
and
breathlessly
,
without
betraying
our
presence
by
the
utterance
of
a
single
word
.
 
<EOS>
To
reach
the
side
of
the
boulder
we
were
compelled
to
walk
through
the
shallow
water
,
but
Muriel
,
quite
undaunted
,
sprang
lithely
along
at
my
side
,
and
with
one
accord
we
swarmed
up
the
steep
rock
,
gripping
its
slippery
face
with
our
hands
and
laying
ourselves
flat
as
we
came
to
its
summit
.
 
<EOS>
Then
together
we
peered
over
,
just
,
however
,
in
time
to
see
two
dark
figures
of
men
disappearing
into
the
thicket
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
glen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
they
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
recognize
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
They
are
entire
strangers
to
me
,
"
was
her
answer
.
"
<EOS>
But
they
seem
fairly
well
dressed
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
two
sportsmen
from
some
shooting
-
party
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
They
've
lost
their
way
most
probably
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
think
they
carried
guns
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
them
had
something
over
his
shoulder
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
it
a
gun
?
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
was
n't
carrying
it
like
he
'd
carry
a
gun
.
<EOS>
It
was
short
--
and
seemed
more
like
a
spade
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
spade
!
"
<EOS>
she
gasped
quickly
in
a
low
voice
.
"
<EOS>
A
spade
!
<EOS>
Are
you
certain
of
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
at
all
certain
.
<EOS>
We
only
had
an
instantaneous
glance
of
them
.
<EOS>
We
were
unfortunately
too
late
to
see
them
face
to
face
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
back
of
one
of
the
men
,
the
tall
fellow
in
the
brown
suit
,
was
broad
and
square
--
the
back
of
someone
who
is
familiar
to
me
,
only
for
the
moment
I
ca
n't
recollect
whose
it
resembles
.
<EOS>
"
She
only
spoke
in
a
whisper
,
fearing
lest
we
should
be
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
I
longed
to
scramble
down
and
rush
after
the
intruders
,
only
the
belief
that
one
of
them
carried
a
spade
and
the
other
<EOS>
an
iron
bar
struck
me
as
curious
,
while
at
the
same
moment
my
eye
caught
sight
of
a
portion
of
the
ground
below
us
at
the
base
of
the
rock
which
had
evidently
been
recently
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
spade
the
man
is
carrying
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
excitedly
.
<EOS>
"
Look
down
there
!
<EOS>
They
've
just
been
burying
something
!
"
 
<EOS>
Her
quick
eyes
followed
the
direction
I
indicated
,
and
she
answered
:
 
"
I
really
believe
they
have
concealed
something
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
when
we
had
allowed
the
men
to
get
beyond
hearing
,
we
both
slipped
down
to
the
other
side
of
the
boulder
and
there
discovered
many
signs
that
the
earth
had
been
hurriedly
excavated
and
only
just
replaced
.
 
<EOS>
Quicker
than
it
takes
to
describe
the
exciting
incident
which
followed
,
we
broke
down
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
with
it
commenced
moving
the
freshly
disturbed
earth
,
which
was
still
soft
and
easily
removed
.
 
<EOS>
Muriel
found
a
dead
branch
in
the
vicinity
,
and
both
of
us
set
to
work
with
a
will
,
eager
to
ascertain
what
was
hidden
there
.
<EOS>
That
something
had
certainly
been
concealed
was
,
to
us
,
quite
evident
,
but
what
it
really
was
we
could
not
surmise
.
<EOS>
The
hole
they
had
dug
did
not
seem
large
enough
to
admit
a
human
body
,
yet
leaves
had
been
carefully
strewn
over
the
place
which
,
if
approached
from
any
other
point
than
the
high
-
up
one
whence
we
had
seen
it
,
would
arouse
no
suspicion
that
the
ground
had
ever
been
interfered
with
.
 
<EOS>
Digging
with
a
piece
of
wood
was
hard
and
laborious
work
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
removed
sufficient
earth
to
make
a
hole
of
any
size
.
<EOS>
But
Muriel
exerted
all
her
energy
,
and
both
of
us
worked
on
in
dogged
silence
full
of
wonder
and
anticipation
.
<EOS>
With
a
spade
we
should
have
soon
been
able
to
investigate
,
but
the
earth
having
apparently
been
stamped
down
hard
prior
to
the
last
covering
being
put
upon
it
,
our
progress
was
very
slow
and
difficult
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
after
we
had
commenced
,
Muriel
,
standing
in
the
hole
and
having
dug
her
stake
deeply
into
the
ground
,
suddenly
cried
:
 
"
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
Look
,
Mr.
Gregg
!
<EOS>
Why
--
whatever
is
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
bent
forward
as
she
indicated
,
and
my
eyes
met
an
object
so
unexpected
that
I
was
held
dumb
and
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
By
what
we
had
succeeded
in
discovering
,
the
mystery
was
increased
rather
than
diminished
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
vent
to
an
ejaculation
of
complete
bewilderment
,
and
looked
blankly
into
my
companion
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
amazing
enigma
was
surely
complete
!
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VII
 
CONTAINS
A
SURPRISE
  
<EOS>
The
first
object
brought
to
light
,
about
two
feet
beneath
the
surface
,
was
a
piece
of
dark
gray
woolen
stuff
which
,
when
the
mold
was
removed
,
proved
to
be
part
of
a
woman
's
skirt
.
 
<EOS>
With
frantic
eagerness
I
got
into
the
hole
we
had
made
and
removed
the
soil
with
my
hands
,
until
I
suddenly
touched
something
hard
.
 
<EOS>
A
body
lay
there
,
doubled
up
and
crushed
into
the
well
-
like
hole
the
men
had
dug
.
 
<EOS>
Together
we
pulled
it
out
,
when
,
to
my
surprise
,
on
wiping
away
the
dirt
from
the
hard
waxen
features
,
I
recognized
it
as
the
body
of
Armida
,
the
woman
who
had
been
my
servant
in
Leghorn
and
who
had
afterwards
married
Olinto
.
<EOS>
Both
had
been
assassinated
!
 
<EOS>
When
Muriel
gazed
upon
the
dead
woman
's
face
she
gave
vent
to
an
expression
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
body
was
evidently
not
that
of
the
person
she
had
expected
to
find
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
she
,
I
wonder
?
"
<EOS>
my
companion
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
a
lady
,
evidently
,
by
her
dress
and
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Evidently
not
,
"
was
my
response
,
for
I
still
deemed
it
best
to
keep
my
own
counsel
.
<EOS>
I
recollected
the
story
Olinto
had
told
me
about
his
wife
;
of
her
illness
and
her
longing
to
return
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
dead
woman
's
countenance
must
have
been
healthy
enough
in
life
,
although
her
hands
were
rough
and
hard
,
showing
that
she
had
been
doing
manual
labor
.
 
<EOS>
Armida
had
been
a
particularly
good
housemaid
,
a
black
-
haired
,
black
-
eyed
Tuscan
,
quick
,
cleanly
,
and
full
of
a
keen
sense
of
humor
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
shock
to
me
to
find
her
lying
there
dead
.
<EOS>
The
breast
of
her
dress
was
stained
with
dried
blood
,
which
,
on
examination
,
I
found
had
issued
from
a
deep
and
fatal
wound
beneath
the
ear
where
she
had
been
struck
an
unerring
blow
that
had
severed
the
artery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
men
--
those
men
who
buried
her
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
who
they
were
?
"
<EOS>
my
companion
exclaimed
in
a
hushed
voice
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
follow
them
and
ascertain
.
<EOS>
They
are
certainly
the
murderers
who
have
returned
in
secret
and
concealed
the
evidence
of
this
second
crime
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
after
them
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
escape
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
leaving
the
exhumed
body
beneath
a
tree
,
I
caught
Muriel
by
the
waist
and
waded
across
the
deep
channel
worn
by
the
stream
at
that
point
,
after
which
we
both
ascended
the
steep
bank
where
the
pair
had
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
I
blamed
myself
a
thousand
times
for
not
following
them
,
yet
my
suspicions
had
not
been
aroused
until
after
they
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
The
back
of
the
man
in
a
snuff
-
colored
suit
was
,
she
felt
confident
,
familiar
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
repeated
what
she
had
already
told
me
,
yet
she
could
not
remember
where
she
had
seen
a
similar
figure
before
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
on
through
the
gloomy
forest
,
for
the
light
had
faded
and
evening
was
now
creeping
on
.
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
we
halted
and
listened
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
dead
silence
,
broken
only
by
the
shrill
cry
of
a
night
bird
and
the
low
rustling
of
the
leaves
in
the
autumn
wind
.
<EOS>
The
men
knew
their
way
,
it
seemed
,
even
though
the
wood
was
trackless
.
<EOS>
Yet
they
had
nearly
twenty
minutes
start
of
us
,
and
in
that
time
they
might
be
already
out
in
the
open
country
.
<EOS>
Would
they
succeed
in
evading
us
?
<EOS>
Yet
even
if
they
did
,
I
could
describe
the
dress
of
one
of
them
,
while
that
of
his
companion
was
,
as
far
as
I
made
out
,
dark
blue
,
of
a
somewhat
nautical
cut
.
<EOS>
He
wore
also
a
flat
cap
,
with
a
peak
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
on
,
striking
straight
for
the
open
moorland
which
we
knew
bounded
the
woods
in
that
direction
,
and
before
the
light
had
entirely
faded
we
found
ourselves
out
amongst
the
heather
with
the
distant
hills
looming
dark
against
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
But
we
saw
no
sign
of
the
men
who
had
so
secretly
concealed
the
body
of
their
victim
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
you
back
to
the
castle
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
then
I
'll
drive
on
into
Dumfries
and
see
the
police
.
<EOS>
These
men
must
be
arrested
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
do
,
"
she
urged
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
get
into
the
house
by
the
stable
-
yard
,
for
they
must
not
see
me
in
this
terrible
plight
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
rough
walking
,
therefore
at
my
invitation
she
took
my
arm
,
and
as
she
did
so
<EOS>
I
felt
that
she
was
shivering
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
wet
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
wo
n't
take
cold
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
'm
used
to
getting
wet
.
<EOS>
I
drive
and
cycle
a
lot
,
you
know
,
and
very
often
get
drenched
,
"
was
her
reply
.
<EOS>
Then
after
a
pause
she
said
:
"
We
must
discover
who
that
woman
was
.
<EOS>
She
seems
,
from
her
complexion
and
her
hair
,
to
be
a
foreigner
,
like
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
so
,
"
was
my
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
the
police
all
that
we
have
found
out
,
and
they
will
go
there
presently
and
recover
the
body
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
they
can
only
find
those
two
men
,
then
we
should
know
the
truth
,
"
she
declared
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
them
--
the
one
in
brown
--
was
unusually
broad
-
shouldered
,
and
seemed
to
walk
with
a
slight
stoop
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
expected
to
discover
another
woman
,
did
you
not
,
Miss
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
presently
,
as
we
walked
across
the
moor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
expected
to
find
an
entirely
different
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
had
found
her
it
would
have
proved
the
guilt
of
someone
with
whom
you
are
acquainted
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
what
we
have
found
this
evening
does
not
convey
to
you
the
identity
of
the
assassins
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
unfortunately
it
does
not
.
<EOS>
We
must
for
the
present
leave
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
the
identity
of
the
dead
woman
is
established
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
might
furnish
me
with
a
clue
,
"
she
exclaimed
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
try
and
discover
who
she
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
was
the
woman
you
expected
to
find
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
friend
--
a
very
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
tell
me
her
name
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
would
be
unfair
to
her
,
"
she
responded
decisively
,
an
answer
which
to
me
was
particularly
tantalizing
.
 
<EOS>
On
we
plodded
in
silence
,
our
thoughts
too
full
for
words
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
strange
that
the
mysterious
yachtsman
should
be
her
lover
,
and
stranger
still
that
on
recognizing
me
he
should
have
escaped
,
not
only
from
Scotland
,
but
away
to
the
Continent
?
 
<EOS>
Was
not
that
,
in
itself
,
evidence
of
guilt
and
fear
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
dark
when
I
took
leave
of
my
bright
little
companion
,
who
,
tired
out
and
yet
uncomplaining
,
<EOS>
pressed
my
hand
and
wished
me
good
fortune
in
my
investigations
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
await
you
to
-
morrow
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Call
and
tell
me
everything
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
promised
,
and
then
she
disappeared
into
the
great
stable
-
yard
behind
the
castle
,
while
I
went
on
down
the
dark
road
and
then
struck
across
the
open
fields
to
my
uncle
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
nine
that
night
I
pulled
up
the
dog
-
cart
before
the
chief
police
-
station
in
Dumfries
,
and
alighting
at
once
sought
the
big
fair
Highlander
,
Mackenzie
,
with
whom
I
had
had
the
consultation
on
the
previous
day
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
were
seated
in
his
room
beneath
the
hissing
gas
-
jet
,
I
related
my
adventure
and
the
result
of
my
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
jumping
up
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
unearthed
another
body
--
a
woman
's
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
And
what
is
more
,
I
can
identify
her
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Her
name
is
Armida
,
and
she
was
wife
of
the
murdered
man
Olinto
Santini
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
both
husband
and
wife
were
killed
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Without
a
doubt
--
a
double
tragedy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
the
two
men
who
concealed
the
body
!
<EOS>
Will
you
describe
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
and
he
wrote
at
my
dictation
,
afterwards
remarking--
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
find
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
calling
in
one
of
his
sub
-
inspectors
,
he
gave
him
instructions
for
the
immediate
circulation
of
the
description
to
all
the
police
-
stations
in
the
county
,
saying
the
two
men
were
wanted
on
a
charge
of
willful
murder
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
official
had
gone
out
again
and
we
were
alone
,
Mackenzie
turned
to
me
and
asked--
 
<EOS>
"
What
induced
you
to
search
the
wood
?
<EOS>
Why
did
you
suspect
a
second
crime
?
"
 
<EOS>
His
question
nonplused
me
for
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
see
,
I
had
identified
the
young
man
Olinto
,
and
knowing
him
to
be
married
and
devoted
to
his
wife
<EOS>
,
I
suspected
that
she
had
accompanied
him
here
.
<EOS>
It
was
entirely
a
vague
surmise
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
whether
,
if
the
poor
fellow
had
fallen
a
victim
to
his
enemies
,
she
had
not
also
been
struck
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
lips
were
pressed
together
in
distinct
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
knew
my
explanation
to
be
a
very
lame
one
,
but
at
all
hazards
<EOS>
I
could
not
import
Muriel
's
name
into
the
affair
.
<EOS>
I
had
given
her
my
promise
,
and
I
intended
to
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
the
body
is
still
in
the
glen
,
where
you
left
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
,
I
will
take
you
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
can
drive
you
and
your
assistant
up
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
rising
at
once
and
ringing
his
bell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
three
good
lanterns
and
some
matches
,
and
put
them
in
this
gentleman
's
trap
outside
,
"
he
said
to
the
constable
who
answered
his
summons
.
"
<EOS>
And
tell
Gilbert
Campbell
that
I
want
him
to
go
with
me
up
to
Rannoch
Wood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
answered
the
man
;
and
the
door
again
closed
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
--
a
thousand
pities
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
that
you
did
n't
stop
those
two
men
who
buried
the
body
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
already
across
the
stream
,
and
disappearing
into
the
thicket
before
I
mounted
the
rock
,
"
I
explained
.
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
at
the
moment
I
had
no
suspicion
of
what
they
'd
been
doing
.
<EOS>
I
believed
them
to
be
stragglers
from
a
neighboring
shooting
-
party
who
had
lost
their
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
most
unfortunate
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
do
n't
escape
us
.
<EOS>
If
they
're
foreigners
,
they
are
not
likely
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
But
if
they
're
English
or
Scots
,
then
I
fear
there
's
but
little
chance
of
us
coming
up
with
them
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
at
the
inquest
the
identity
of
the
murdered
man
was
strictly
preserved
,
and
the
inquiry
was
adjourned
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
my
name
was
not
mentioned
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
was
the
detective
's
reply
.
<EOS>
Then
he
asked
:
"
When
do
you
expect
to
get
a
telegram
from
your
friend
,
the
Consul
at
Leghorn
?
<EOS>
I
am
anxious
for
that
,
in
order
that
we
may
commence
inquiries
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
He
will
certainly
reply
at
once
,
providing
the
dead
man
's
father
can
still
be
found
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
at
that
moment
a
tall
,
thin
man
,
who
proved
to
be
Detective
Campbell
,
entered
,
and
five
minutes
later
we
were
all
three
driving
over
the
uneven
cobbles
of
Dumfries
and
out
in
the
darkness
towards
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
cloudy
and
starless
,
with
a
chill
mist
hanging
over
the
valley
;
but
my
uncle
's
cob
was
a
swift
one
,
and
we
soon
began
to
ascend
the
hill
up
past
the
castle
,
and
then
,
turning
to
the
left
,
drove
along
a
steep
,
rough
by
-
road
which
led
to
the
south
of
the
wood
and
out
across
the
moor
.
<EOS>
When
we
reached
the
latter
we
all
descended
,
and
I
led
the
horse
,
for
owing
to
the
many
treacherous
bogs
it
was
unsafe
to
drive
further
.
<EOS>
So
,
with
Mackenzie
and
Campbell
carrying
lanterns
,
we
walked
on
carefully
,
skirting
the
wood
for
nearly
a
mile
until
we
came
to
the
rough
wall
over
which
I
had
clambered
with
Muriel
.
 
<EOS>
I
recognized
the
spot
,
and
having
tied
up
the
cob
<EOS>
we
all
three
plunged
into
the
pitch
-
darkness
of
the
wood
,
keeping
straight
on
in
the
direction
of
the
glen
,
and
halting
every
now
and
then
to
listen
for
the
rippling
of
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
after
some
difficulty
,
we
discovered
it
,
and
searching
along
the
bank
with
our
three
powerful
lights
,
I
presently
detected
the
huge
moss
-
grown
boulder
whereon
I
had
stood
when
the
pair
of
fugitives
had
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
!
"
<EOS>
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
spot
!
"
<EOS>
And
quickly
we
clambered
down
the
steep
bank
,
lowering
ourselves
by
the
branches
of
the
trees
until
we
came
to
the
water
into
which
I
waded
,
being
followed
closely
by
my
two
companions
.
 
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
opposite
side
I
clambered
up
to
the
base
of
the
boulder
and
lowered
my
lantern
to
reveal
to
them
the
gruesome
evidence
of
the
second
crime
,
but
the
next
instant
I
cried--
 
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
It
's
gone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
the
two
men
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
It
was
here
.
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
this
is
the
hole
where
they
buried
it
!
<EOS>
But
they
evidently
returned
,
and
finding
it
exhumed
,
they
've
retaken
possession
of
it
and
carried
it
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
two
detectives
gazed
down
to
where
I
indicated
,
and
then
looked
at
each
other
without
exchanging
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
stood
there
dumbfounded
at
the
disappearance
of
the
body
,
the
Highlander
's
quick
glance
caught
something
,
and
stooping
he
picked
it
up
and
examined
the
little
object
by
the
aid
of
his
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
Within
his
palm
I
saw
lying
a
tiny
little
gold
cross
,
about
an
inch
long
,
enameled
in
red
,
while
in
the
center
was
a
circular
miniature
of
a
kneeling
saint
,
an
elegant
and
beautifully
executed
little
trinket
which
might
have
adorned
a
lady
's
bracelet
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
pretty
little
thing
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
the
detective
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
possibly
lead
us
to
something
.
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
me
,
"
are
you
quite
certain
you
left
the
body
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certain
?
<EOS>
"
I
echoed
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look
at
the
hole
I
made
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
think
I
have
any
interest
in
leading
you
here
on
a
fool
's
errand
,
do
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
he
said
apologetically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
the
whole
affair
seems
so
very
inconceivable
--
I
mean
that
the
men
,
having
once
got
rid
of
the
evidence
of
their
crime
,
would
hardly
return
to
the
spot
and
re
-
obtain
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unless
they
watched
me
exhume
it
,
and
feared
the
consequences
if
it
fell
into
your
hands
,
"
I
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
might
have
watched
you
from
behind
the
trees
,
and
when
you
had
gone
they
came
and
carried
it
away
somewhere
else
,
"
he
remarked
dubiously
;
"
but
even
if
they
did
,
it
must
be
in
this
wood
.
<EOS>
They
would
never
risk
carrying
a
body
very
far
,
and
here
is
surely
the
best
place
of
concealment
in
the
whole
country
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
only
thing
remaining
is
to
search
the
wood
at
daylight
,
"
I
suggested
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
two
men
came
back
here
during
my
absence
they
may
still
be
on
the
watch
in
the
vicinity
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
probably
they
are
.
<EOS>
We
must
take
every
precaution
,
"
he
said
decisively
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
with
our
lanterns
lowered
,
we
made
an
examination
of
the
vicinity
,
without
,
however
,
discovering
anything
else
to
furnish
us
with
a
clew
.
<EOS>
While
I
had
been
absent
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
Armida
had
disappeared
--
a
fact
which
,
knowing
all
that
I
did
,
was
doubly
mysterious
.
 
<EOS>
The
pair
had
,
without
doubt
,
watched
Muriel
and
myself
,
and
as
soon
as
we
had
gone
they
had
returned
and
carried
off
the
ghastly
remains
of
the
poor
woman
who
had
been
so
foully
done
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
were
the
men
--
the
fellow
with
the
broad
shoulders
whom
Muriel
recognized
,
and
the
slim
seafarer
in
his
pilot
-
coat
and
peaked
cap
?
<EOS>
The
enigma
each
hour
became
more
and
more
inscrutable
.
 
<EOS>
At
dawn
Mackenzie
,
with
four
of
his
men
,
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
wood
,
but
although
they
continued
until
dusk
they
discovered
nothing
,
neither
was
anything
heard
of
the
mysterious
seafarer
and
his
companion
in
brown
tweeds
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
on
Muriel
as
arranged
,
and
explained
how
the
body
had
so
suddenly
disappeared
,
whereupon
she
stared
at
me
pale
-
faced
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
The
assassins
must
have
watched
us
!
<EOS>
They
are
aware
,
then
,
that
we
have
knowledge
of
their
crime
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
hoarsely
.
<EOS>
"
Then
we
are
both
in
deadly
peril
--
peril
of
our
own
lives
!
<EOS>
These
people
will
hesitate
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
Both
you
and
I
are
marked
down
by
them
,
without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
We
must
both
be
wary
not
to
fall
into
any
trap
they
may
lay
for
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
very
words
seemed
an
admission
that
she
was
aware
of
the
identity
of
the
conspirators
,
and
yet
she
would
give
me
no
clue
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
out
and
up
the
drive
together
to
the
kennels
,
where
her
father
,
a
tall
,
imposing
figure
in
his
shooting
-
kit
,
was
giving
orders
to
the
keepers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
,
Gregg
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
merrily
,
extending
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
make
one
of
a
party
to
Glenlea
to
-
morrow
,
wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Paton
and
Phillips
are
coming
.
<EOS>
Ten
sharp
here
,
and
the
ladies
are
coming
out
to
lunch
with
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thanks
,
"
I
said
,
accepting
with
pleasure
,
for
by
so
doing
<EOS>
I
saw
that
I
might
be
afforded
an
opportunity
of
being
near
Muriel
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
the
assassins
were
aware
of
our
knowledge
seemed
to
have
caused
her
the
greatest
apprehension
lest
evil
should
befall
us
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
we
turned
away
to
go
back
to
the
house
,
Leithcourt
said
to
me--
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
all
about
the
discovery
up
at
the
wood
the
other
day
!
<EOS>
Horrible
affair
--
a
young
foreigner
found
murdered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
've
heard
about
it
,
"
I
responded
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
police
are
worse
than
useless
,
"
he
declared
with
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
n't
discovered
who
the
fellow
is
yet
.
<EOS>
Why
,
if
it
had
happened
anywhere
else
but
in
Scotland
,
they
'd
have
arrested
the
assassin
before
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
an
entire
stranger
<EOS>
,
I
hear
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
And
then
added
:
"
You
often
go
up
to
the
wood
of
an
evening
after
pigeons
.
<EOS>
It
's
fortunate
<EOS>
you
were
not
there
that
evening
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
me
quickly
with
his
brows
slightly
contracted
,
as
though
he
did
not
exactly
comprehend
me
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
I
saw
that
my
remark
had
caused
him
quick
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
answered
with
a
sickly
smile
which
he
intended
should
convey
to
me
utter
unconcern
.
<EOS>
"
They
might
have
suspected
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
is
a
disagreeable
affair
to
happen
on
one
's
property
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
still
watching
him
narrowly
.
<EOS>
And
then
Muriel
at
his
side
managed
with
her
feminine
ingenuity
to
divert
the
conversation
into
a
different
channel
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
I
accompanied
the
party
over
to
Glenlea
,
about
five
miles
distant
,
and
at
noon
at
a
spot
previously
arranged
,
we
found
the
ladies
awaiting
us
with
luncheon
spread
under
the
trees
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
approached
Muriel
came
forward
quickly
,
handing
me
a
telegram
,
saying
that
it
had
been
sent
over
by
one
of
my
uncle
's
grooms
at
the
moment
they
were
leaving
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
I
tore
it
open
eagerly
,
and
read
its
contents
.
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
my
companions
,
said
in
as
quiet
a
voice
as
I
could
<EOS>
command--
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
up
to
London
to
-
night
,
"
whereat
<EOS>
the
men
,
one
and
all
,
expressed
hope
that
I
should
soon
return
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
's
party
were
a
friendly
set
,
and
at
heart
I
was
sorry
to
leave
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
telegram
made
it
imperative
,
for
it
was
from
Frank
Hutcheson
in
Leghorn
,
and
read--
 
_
"
Made

<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
The
lunch
was
a
merry
one
,
as
shooting
luncheons
usually
are
,
and
while
we
ate
the
keepers
packed
our
morning
bag
--
a
considerable
one
--
into
the
Perth
-
cart
in
waiting
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
we
could
wander
away
alone
together
,
I
explained
to
Muriel
that
the
reason
of
my
sudden
journey
to
London
was
in
order
to
continue
my
investigations
regarding
the
mysterious
affair
.
 
<EOS>
This
puzzled
her
,
for
I
had
not
,
of
course
,
revealed
to
her
that
I
had
identified
Olinto
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
managed
to
make
such
excuses
and
promises
to
return
that
I
think
allayed
all
her
suspicions
,
and
that
night
,
after
calling
upon
the
detective
Mackenzie
,
I
took
the
sleeping
-
car
express
to
Euston
.
 
<EOS>
The
restaurant
which
Hutcheson
had
indicated
was
,
I
found
,
situated
about
half
-
way
up
Westbourne
Grove
,
nearly
opposite
Whiteley
's
,
a
small
place
where
confectionery
and
sweets
were
displayed
in
the
window
,
together
with
long
-
necked
flasks
of
Italian
chianti
,
chump
-
chops
,
small
joints
and
tomatoes
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
after
nine
o'clock
when
I
entered
the
long
shop
with
its
rows
of
marble
-
topped
tables
and
greasy
lounges
of
red
plush
.
<EOS>
An
unhealthy
-
looking
lad
was
sweeping
out
the
place
with
wet
saw
-
dust
,
and
<EOS>
a
big
,
dark
-
bearded
,
flabby
-
faced
man
in
shirt
-
sleeves
stood
behind
the
small
counter
polishing
some
forks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
see
Signor
Ferrari
,
"
I
said
,
addressing
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
Ferrari
,
he
is
dead
,
"
responded
the
man
in
broken
English
.
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Odinzoff
.
<EOS>
I
bought
the
place
from
madame
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
Russian
,
I
presume
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Polish
,
m'sieur
--
from
Varsovie
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
from
the
first
moment
we
had
met
that
he
was
no
Italian
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
bulky
,
and
his
face
too
broad
and
flat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
inquire
after
a
waiter
you
have
in
your
service
,
an
Italian
named
Santini
.
<EOS>
He
was
my
servant
for
some
years
,
and
I
naturally
take
an
interest
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Santini
?
"
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
I
you
mean
Olinto
?
<EOS>
He
is
not
here
yet
.
<EOS>
He
comes
at
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
reply
surprised
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
expected
the
restaurant
-
keeper
to
express
regret
at
his
disappearance
,
yet
he
spoke
as
though
he
had
been
at
work
as
usual
on
the
previous
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
have
a
liqueur
brandy
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
seeing
that
I
would
be
compelled
to
take
something
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
have
one
with
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ach
no
!
<EOS>
But
a
kuemmel
--
<EOS>
yes
,
I
will
have
a
kuemmel
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
filled
our
glasses
,
and
tossed
off
his
own
at
a
single
gulp
,
smacking
his
lips
after
it
,
for
the
average
Russian
dearly
loves
his
national
decoction
of
caraway
seeds
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
find
Olinto
a
good
servant
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
for
want
of
something
else
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excellent
.
<EOS>
The
Italians
are
the
best
waiters
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
am
Russian
,
but
dare
not
employ
a
Russian
waiter
.
<EOS>
These
English
would
not
come
to
my
shop
if
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
looked
around
,
and
it
struck
me
that
the
trade
of
the
place
mainly
consisted
in
chops
and
steaks
for
chance
customers
at
mid
-
day
,
and
tea
and
cake
for
those
swarms
of
women
who
each
afternoon
buzz
around
that
long
line
of
windows
of
the
"
world
's
provider
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
see
that
his
was
a
cheap
trade
,
as
revealed
by
the
printed
notice
stuck
upon
one
of
the
long
fly
-
blown
mirrors
:
"
Ices
_
4d
_
and
_
6d
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
long
has
Olinto
been
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
a
year
--
perhaps
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
I
trust
him
implicitly
,
and
I
leave
him
in
charge
when
I
go
away
for
holidays
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
get
along
very
well
with
the
cook
--
who
is
Milanese
.
<EOS>
These
Italians
from
different
provinces
always
quarrel
,
"
he
added
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
live
in
Italy
you
know
that
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
laughed
in
chorus
,
and
then
glancing
at
my
watch
,
said
:
"
I
'll
wait
for
him
,
if
he
will
be
here
at
ten
.
<EOS>
I
'd
much
like
to
see
him
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Russian
was
by
no
means
nonplused
,
but
merely
remarked--
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
late
sometimes
,
but
not
often
.
<EOS>
He
lives
on
the
other
side
of
London
--
over
at
Camberwell
.
"
<EOS>
His
confidence
that
the
waiter
would
return
struck
me
as
extremely
curious
;
nevertheless
I
possessed
myself
in
patience
,
strolled
up
and
down
the
restaurant
,
and
then
stood
watching
the
traffic
in
the
Grove
outside
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
Odinzoff
seemed
a
quick
,
hard
-
working
fellow
with
a
keen
eye
to
business
,
for
he
fell
to
polishing
the
top
of
the
marble
tables
with
a
pail
and
brush
,
at
the
same
time
directing
the
work
of
the
pallid
-
looking
youth
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
side
door
opened
,
and
the
cook
put
his
head
in
to
speak
with
his
master
in
French
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
typical
Italian
,
about
forty
,
with
dark
mustaches
turned
upwards
,
and
an
easy
-
going
,
careless
manner
.
<EOS>
Seeing
me
,
however
,
and
believing
me
to
be
a
customer
,
he
turned
and
closed
the
door
quickly
.
<EOS>
In
that
instant
I
noticed
the
high
broadness
of
his
shoulders
,
and
his
back
struck
me
as
strangely
similar
to
that
of
the
man
in
brown
whom
we
had
seen
disappearing
in
Rannoch
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
The
suspicion
held
me
breathless
.
 
<EOS>
Was
this
Russian
endeavoring
to
deceive
me
when
he
declared
that
Olinto
would
arrive
in
a
few
minutes
?
<EOS>
It
seemed
curious
,
for
the
man
now
dead
must
,
I
reflected
,
have
been
away
at
least
four
days
.
<EOS>
Surely
his
absence
from
work
had
caused
the
proprietor
considerable
inconvenience
?
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
your
cook
,
was
n't
it
?
<EOS>
The
Milanese
who
is
quarrelsome
?
<EOS>
"
I
laughed
,
when
the
side
door
had
closed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
But
Emilio
is
a
very
good
workman
--
and
very
honest
,
even
though
I
had
constantly
to
complain
that
he
uses
too
much
oil
in
his
cooking
.
<EOS>
These
English
do
not
like
the
oil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
stood
in
the
doorway
again
watching
the
busy
throng
passing
outside
towards
Royal
Oak
.
<EOS>
Ten
o'clock
struck
from
a
neighboring
church
,
and
I
still
waited
,
knowing
only
too
well
that
I
waited
in
vain
for
a
man
whose
body
had
already
been
committed
to
the
grave
outside
that
far
-
away
old
Scotch
town
.
<EOS>
But
I
waited
in
order
to
ascertain
the
motive
of
the
bearded
Russian
in
leading
me
to
believe
that
the
young
fellow
would
really
return
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
Odinzoff
went
outside
,
carrying
with
him
two
boards
upon
which
the
menu
of
the
"
Eight
-
penny
Luncheon
!
<EOS>
This
Day
!
"
was
written
in
scrawly
characters
,
and
proceeded
to
affix
them
to
the
shop
-
front
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
my
opportunity
,
and
quick
as
thought
I
moved
towards
where
the
unhealthy
youth
was
at
work
,
and
whispered
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
you
half
-
a
-
sovereign
if
you
'll
answer
my
questions
truthfully
.
<EOS>
Now
,
tell
me
,
was
the
cook
,
the
man
I
've
just
seen
,
here
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Was
he
here
the
day
before
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
away
ill
for
four
days
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
And
your
master
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
away
too
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
time
to
put
any
further
question
,
for
the
Russian
re
-
entered
at
that
moment
,
and
the
youth
busied
himself
rubbing
the
front
of
the
counter
in
pretense
that
I
had
not
spoken
to
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
had
some
difficulty
in
slipping
the
promised
coin
into
his
hand
at
a
moment
when
his
master
was
not
looking
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
paced
up
and
down
the
restaurant
,
waiting
patiently
and
wondering
whether
the
absence
of
Emilio
had
any
connection
with
the
tragedy
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
stood
there
a
rather
thin
,
respectably
-
dressed
man
entered
,
and
seating
himself
upon
one
of
the
plush
lounges
at
the
further
end
,
removed
his
bowler
hat
and
ordered
from
the
proprietor
a
chop
and
a
pot
of
tea
.
<EOS>
Then
,
taking
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
,
he
settled
himself
to
read
,
apparently
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
as
I
watched
I
saw
that
over
the
top
of
his
paper
he
was
carefully
taking
in
the
general
appearance
of
the
place
,
and
his
eyes
were
keenly
following
the
Russian
's
movements
.
<EOS>
The
latter
shouted
--
in
French
--
<EOS>
the
order
for
the
chop
through
the
speaking
-
tube
to
the
man
Emilio
,
and
then
returning
to
his
customer
<EOS>
he
spread
out
a
napkin
and
placed
a
small
cruet
,
with
knife
,
fork
,
and
bread
before
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
customer
seemed
immersed
in
his
paper
,
and
never
looked
up
until
after
the
Russian
's
back
was
turned
.
<EOS>
Then
so
deep
was
his
interest
in
the
place
,
and
so
keen
those
dark
eyes
of
his
,
that
the
truth
suddenly
dawned
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Mackenzie
had
telegraphed
to
Scotland
Yard
,
and
the
customer
sitting
there
was
a
detective
who
had
come
to
investigate
.
<EOS>
I
had
advanced
to
the
counter
to
chat
again
with
the
proprietor
,
when
a
quick
step
behind
me
caused
me
to
turn
.
 
<EOS>
Before
me
stood
the
slim
figure
of
a
man
in
a
straw
hat
and
rather
seedy
black
jacket
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Dio
Signor
Padrone
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
I
staggered
as
though
I
had
received
a
blow
.
 
<EOS>
Olinto
Santini
in
the
flesh
,
smiling
and
well
,
stood
there
before
me
!

of
mine
can
express
my
absolute
and
abject
amazement
when
I
faced
the
man
,
whom
I
had
seen
lying
cold
and
dead
upon
that
gray
stone
slab
in
the
mortuary
at
Dumfries
.
 
<EOS>
My
eye
caught
the
customer
who
,
on
the
entry
of
Olinto
,
had
dropped
his
paper
and
sat
staring
at
him
in
wonderment
.
<EOS>
The
detective
had
evidently
been
furnished
with
a
photograph
of
the
dead
man
,
and
now
,
like
myself
,
discovered
him
alive
and
living
.
 
<EOS>
"
Signor
Padrone
!
"
cried
the
man
whose
appearance
was
so
absolutely
bewildering
.
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
find
me
here
?
<EOS>
I
admit
that
I
deceived
you
when
I
told
you
I
worked
at
the
Milano
,
"
he
went
on
rapidly
in
Italian
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
was
under
compulsion
--
<EOS>
my
actions
that
night
were
not
my
own
--
but
those
of
others
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
understand
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
come
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
speak
before
these
people
.
<EOS>
Your
padrone
knows
Italian
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
only
a
very
little
,
"
he
answered
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
no
fear
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
Emilio
,
the
cook
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
met
him
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
quickly
,
with
a
strange
look
of
apprehension
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
an
undesirable
person
,
signore
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
gather
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
desire
to
speak
to
you
outside
--
not
here
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
turning
with
a
smile
to
the
Pole
,
I
apologized
for
taking
away
his
servant
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
Recollect
,
I
am
his
old
master
,
I
added
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
m'sieur
,
"
answered
the
Pole
,
bowing
politely
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
with
him
where
and
how
long
you
will
.
<EOS>
He
is
entirely
at
your
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
when
we
were
outside
in
Westbourne
Grove
,
Olinto
walking
by
my
side
in
wonderment
,
I
asked
suddenly
:
 
"
Tell
me
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
been
in
Scotland
--
at
Dumfries
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
signore
,
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
another
question
,
"
I
said
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
You
married
Armida
at
the
Italian
Consulate
.
<EOS>
Where
is
she
now
--
where
is
she
this
morning
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
turned
pale
,
and
I
saw
a
complete
change
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
signore
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
responded
,
"
I
only
wish
I
could
tell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
untrue
that
she
is
an
invalid
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
or
that
you
live
in
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
Your
address
is
in
Albany
Road
,
Camberwell
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
deny
these
facts
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
deny
them
,
Signor
Commendatore
.
<EOS>
But
how
did
you
learn
this
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
authorities
in
Italy
know
everything
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Like
that
of
all
your
countrymen
,
your
record
is
written
down
at
the
Commune
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
clean
one
,
at
any
rate
,
signore
,
"
he
declared
with
some
slight
warmth
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
permesso
to
carry
a
revolver
,
which
is
in
itself
sufficient
proof
that
I
am
a
man
of
spotless
character
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
cast
no
reflection
whatever
upon
you
,
Olinto
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
merely
inquired
after
your
wife
,
and
you
do
not
give
me
a
direct
reply
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
had
walked
to
the
Royal
Oak
,
and
stood
talking
on
the
curb
outside
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
no
reply
,
because
I
ca
n't
,
"
he
said
in
Italian
.
<EOS>
"
Armida
--
my
poor
Armida
--
has
left
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
tell
me
such
a
tale
of
distress
regarding
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
have
already
explained
,
signore
,
I
was
not
then
master
of
my
own
actions
.
<EOS>
I
was
ruled
by
others
.
<EOS>
But
I
saved
your
life
at
risk
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
Some
day
,
when
it
is
safe
,
I
will
reveal
to
you
everything
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
allow
the
past
to
remain
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
your
wife
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
hesitated
a
moment
,
looking
straight
into
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Signor
Commendatore
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
she
has
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Disappeared
!
"
<EOS>
I
echoed
.
<EOS>
"
And
have
you
not
made
any
report
to
the
police
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
reasons
known
only
to
myself
I
did
not
wish
the
police
to
pry
into
my
private
affairs
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
Because
you
were
once
convicted
at
Lucca
of
using
a
knife
--
eh
?
<EOS>
I
recollect
quite
well
that
affair
--
a
love
affair
,
<EOS>
was
it
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Signor
Commendatore
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
a
youth
then
--
a
mere
boy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
tell
me
the
circumstances
In
which
Armida
has
disappeared
,
"
I
urged
,
for
I
saw
quite
plainly
that
his
sudden
meeting
with
me
had
upset
him
,
and
that
he
was
trying
to
hold
back
from
me
some
story
which
he
was
bursting
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
signore
,
"
he
said
at
last
in
a
low
tone
of
confidence
,
"
I
do
n't
like
to
trouble
you
with
my
private
affairs
after
those
untruths
I
told
you
when
we
last
met
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
the
truth
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
the
exciting
incidents
of
our
last
meeting
,
I
was
half
inclined
to
doubt
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
Signor
Commendatore
,
that
my
wife
has
mysteriously
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Last
Saturday
,
at
eleven
o'clock
,
she
was
talking
over
the
garden
wall
with
a
neighbor
and
was
then
dressed
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
She
apparently
went
out
,
but
from
that
moment
no
one
has
seen
or
heard
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
tell
him
the
ghastly
truth
,
yet
so
strange
was
the
circumstance
that
his
own
double
,
even
to
the
mole
upon
his
face
,
should
be
lying
dead
and
buried
in
Scotland
that
I
hesitated
to
relate
what
I
knew
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
spoke
English
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
could
make
herself
understood
very
well
,
"
he
said
with
a
sigh
,
and
I
saw
a
heavy
,
thoughtful
look
upon
his
brow
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
really
devoted
to
her
,
I
knew
.
<EOS>
With
the
Italian
of
whatever
station
in
life
,
love
is
all
-
consuming
--
it
is
either
perfect
love
or
genuine
hatred
.
<EOS>
The
Tuscan
character
is
one
of
two
extremes
.
 
<EOS>
I
glanced
across
the
road
,
and
saw
that
the
detective
who
had
ordered
his
chop
and
coffee
had
stopped
to
light
his
pipe
and
was
watching
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
idea
where
your
wife
is
,
or
what
has
induced
her
to
go
away
from
home
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
had
some
words
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Words
,
signore
!
"
<EOS>
he
echoed
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
we
were
the
happiest
pair
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
No
unkind
word
ever
passed
between
us
.
<EOS>
There
seems
absolutely
no
reason
whatever
why
she
should
go
away
without
wishing
me
a
word
of
farewell
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
have
n't
you
told
the
police
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
reasons
that
I
have
already
stated
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
to
make
inquiries
for
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
in
what
have
your
inquiries
resulted
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
--
absolutely
nothing
,
"
he
said
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
suspect
any
plot
?
<EOS>
I
recollect
that
night
in
Lambeth
you
told
me
that
you
had
enemies
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
so
I
have
,
signore
--
<EOS>
and
so
have
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
hoarsely
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
poor
Armida
may
have
been
entrapped
by
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
entrapped
,
what
then
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
they
would
kill
her
with
as
little
compunction
as
they
would
a
fly
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
you
do
not
know
the
callousness
of
those
people
.
<EOS>
I
only
hope
and
pray
that
she
may
have
escaped
and
is
in
hiding
somewhere
,
and
will
arrive
unexpectedly
and
give
me
a
startling
surprise
.
<EOS>
She
delights
in
startling
me
,
"
he
added
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
,
I
thought
,
she
would
never
again
be
able
to
startle
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
actually
fallen
a
victim
just
as
he
dreaded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
think
she
must
have
been
called
away
from
home
by
some
urgent
message
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
manner
in
which
she
left
things
,
it
seemed
as
though
she
went
away
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
There
were
five
sovereigns
in
a
drawer
that
we
had
saved
for
the
rent
,
and
she
took
them
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
paused
again
,
hesitating
whether
to
tell
him
the
terrible
truth
.
<EOS>
I
recollected
that
the
body
had
disappeared
,
therefore
what
proof
had
I
of
my
allegation
that
she
had
been
murdered
?
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Olinto
,
"
I
said
as
we
moved
forward
again
in
the
direction
of
Paddington
Station
,
"
have
you
any
knowledge
of
a
man
named
Leithcourt
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
started
suddenly
and
looked
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
of
him
,
"
he
answered
very
lamely
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
of
his
daughter
--
Muriel
?
"
 
"
And
also
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
acquainted
with
them
--
nor
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
do
I
wish
to
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
they
are
enemies
of
mine
--
bitter
enemies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
declaration
was
strange
,
for
it
threw
some
light
upon
the
tragedy
in
Rannoch
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
of
your
wife
also
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
,
"
he
responded
.
<EOS>
"
My
enemies
are
my
wife
's
also
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
told
me
the
secret
of
that
dastardly
attempt
upon
me
when
we
last
met
,
"
I
said
in
a
low
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Why
not
tell
me
the
truth
?
<EOS>
I
surely
ought
to
know
who
my
enemies
really
are
,
so
as
to
be
warned
against
any
future
plot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
some
day
,
signore
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
tell
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
said
that
before
,
"
I
exclaimed
with
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
faithful
to
me
,
you
ought
at
least
to
tell
me
the
reason
they
wished
to
kill
me
in
secret
.
"
 
"
Because
they
fear
you
,
"
was
his
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
they
fear
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
made
a
gesture
with
his
hands
indicative
of
utter
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
one
question
.
<EOS>
Answer
yes
<EOS>
or
no
.
<EOS>
Is
the
man
<EOS>
Leithcourt
my
enemy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
Italian
paused
,
and
then
answered
:
 
"
He
is
not
your
friend
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
well
aware
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
<EOS>
And
his
daughter
?
<EOS>
She
is
engaged
,
I
hear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
first
meet
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
known
him
several
years
.
<EOS>
When
we
first
met
he
was
poor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Suddenly
became
rich
--
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bought
a
fine
house
in
the
country
;
lives
mostly
at
the
Carlton
when
he
and
his
wife
and
daughter
are
in
London
--
although
I
believe
they
now
have
a
house
somewhere
in
the
West
End
--
and
he
often
makes
long
cruises
on
his
steam
-
yacht
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
he
make
his
money
?
"
 
<EOS>
Again
Olinto
elevated
his
shoulders
,
without
replying
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
would
only
betray
to
me
the
reason
he
had
been
induced
to
entice
me
to
that
house
,
I
might
then
be
able
to
form
some
conclusion
regarding
the
tenants
of
Rannoch
and
their
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Who
was
the
man
who
,
having
represented
the
man
now
before
me
,
had
been
struck
dead
by
an
unerring
hand
?
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
Armida
had
been
called
by
telegram
to
meet
her
husband
,
and
recognizing
the
fraud
perpetrated
upon
her
threatened
to
disclose
it
and
,
for
that
reason
,
shared
the
same
fate
as
the
masquerader
?
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
theory
that
occurred
to
me
;
one
which
I
believed
to
be
the
correct
one
.
<EOS>
The
motive
was
a
mystery
,
yet
the
facts
seemed
to
me
plain
enough
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
young
Italian
had
refused
to
give
any
satisfactory
explanation
,
I
resolved
within
myself
to
wait
until
the
unfortunate
woman
's
body
was
recovered
before
revealing
to
him
the
ghastly
truth
.
<EOS>
Without
doubt
he
had
some
reason
in
withholding
from
me
the
true
facts
,
either
because
he
feared
that
I
might
become
unduly
alarmed
,
or
else
he
himself
had
been
deeply
implicated
in
the
plot
.
<EOS>
Of
the
two
suggestions
,
I
was
inclined
to
believe
in
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
with
me
as
far
as
the
end
of
Bishop
's
Road
,
endeavoring
with
all
the
Italian
's
exquisite
diplomacy
to
obtain
from
me
what
I
knew
concerning
the
Leithcourts
.
<EOS>
But
I
told
him
nothing
,
nor
did
I
reveal
that
I
had
only
that
morning
returned
from
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Then
at
last
we
parted
,
and
he
retraced
his
steps
to
the
little
restaurant
in
Westbourne
Grove
,
while
I
entered
a
hansom
and
drove
to
the
well
-
known
photographer
's
in
New
Bond
Street
,
whose
name
had
been
upon
the
torn
photograph
of
the
young
girl
in
the
white
pique
blouse
and
her
hair
fastened
with
a
bow
of
black
ribbon
,
the
picture
that
I
had
found
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
on
that
memorable
night
in
the
Mediterranean
,
and
a
duplicate
of
which
I
had
seen
in
Muriel
's
cosy
little
room
up
at
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollected
that
she
had
told
me
the
name
of
the
original
was
Elma
Heath
,
and
that
she
had
been
a
schoolfellow
of
hers
at
Chichester
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
inquired
of
the
photographer
's
lady
-
clerk
whether
she
could
supply
me
with
a
print
of
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
considerable
time
she
searched
in
her
books
for
the
name
,
and
at
last
discovered
it
.
<EOS>
Then
she
said
:
 
"
I
regret
,
sir
,
that
we
ca
n't
give
you
a
print
,
for
the
customer
purchased
the
negative
at
the
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
'm
very
sorry
for
that
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
To
what
address
did
you
send
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
customer
who
ordered
it
was
apparently
a
foreigner
,
"
she
said
,
at
the
same
time
turning
round
the
ledger
so
that
I
could
read
.
<EOS>
And
I
saw
that
the
entry
was
:
"
Heath
--
Miss
Elma--3
<EOS>
dozen
cabinets
and
negative
.
<EOS>
Address
:
<EOS>
Baron
Xavier
Oberg
,
<EOS>
Vosnesenski
Prospect

,
St.
Petersburg
,
Russia
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
this
gentleman
come
with
the
young
lady
when
her
portrait
was
taken
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
tell
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
only
been
here
a
year
,
and
you
see
the
date
--
over
two
years
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
photographer
would
know
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
new
man
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
only
came
a
month
ago
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
business
changed
hands
a
year
ago
,
and
none
of
the
previous
employees
have
remained
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
's
unfortunate
,
"
I
said
,
greatly
disappointed
;
and
having
copied
the
address
to
which
the
negative
and
prints
had
been
sent
,
I
thanked
her
and
left
.
 
<EOS>
Who
,
I
wondered
,
was
this
Baron
Oberg
,
and
what
relation
was
he
to
Elma
Heath
?
 
<EOS>
The
picture
of
the
girl
in
the
white
blouse
somehow
exercised
a
strange
attraction
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
never
experienced
the
fascination
of
a
photograph
,
inexplicable
and
yet
forcible
--
a
kind
of
magnetism
from
which
you
can
not
release
yourself
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
the
curious
fact
that
some
person
had
taken
it
from
its
frame
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
and
destroyed
it
that
first
aroused
my
interest
;
or
it
might
have
been
the
discovery
of
it
in
Muriel
's
room
at
Rannoch
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
it
had
for
me
an
absorbing
interest
,
for
I
often
wondered
whether
the
unknown
girl
who
had
secretly
gone
ashore
from
the
yacht
when
I
had
left
it
was
not
Elma
Heath
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Who
was
this
Baron
Oberg
?
<EOS>
The
name
was
German
undoubtedly
,
yet
he
lived
in
the
Russian
capital
.
<EOS>
From
London
to
Petersburg
is
a
far
cry
,
yet
I
resolved
that
if
it
were
necessary
I
would
travel
there
and
investigate
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
German
Embassy
,
in
Carlton
House
Terrace
,
I
found
my
friend
Captain
Nieberding
,
the
second
secretary
,
of
whom
I
inquired
whether
the
name
of
Baron
Oberg
was
known
,
but
having
referred
to
a
number
of
German
books
in
his
Excellency
's
library
,
he
returned
and
told
me
that
the
name
did
not
appear
in
the
lists
of
the
German
nobility
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
be
Russian
--
Polish
most
probably
,
"
added
the
captain
,
a
tall
,
fair
fellow
in
gold
spectacles
,
whom
I
had
known
when
he
was
third
secretary
of
Embassy
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
was
that
it
was
not
a
German
name
,
for
there
was
a
little
place
called
Oberg
,
he
said
,
on
the
railway
between
Lodz
and
Lowicz
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
after
luncheon
,
I
went
to
Albany
Road
,
one
of
those
dreary
,
old
-
fashioned
streets
that
were
pleasant
back
in
the
early
Victorian
days
when
Camberwell
was
a
suburb
and
Walworth
Common
was
still
an
open
waste
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
house
where
Olinto
lived
--
a
small
,
smoke
-
blackened
,
semi
-
detached
place
standing
back
in
a
tiny
strip
of
weedy
garden
,
with
a
wooden
veranda
before
the
first
floor
windows
.
<EOS>
The
house
,
according
to
the
woman
who
kept
a
general
shop
at
the
corner
,
was
occupied
by
two
families
.
<EOS>
The
"
Eye
-
talians
,
"
as
she
termed
them
,
lived
above
,
while
the
Gibbonses
rented
the
ground
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
The
foreigners
are
respectable
enough
.
<EOS>
Always
pays
me
ready
money
for
everythink
,
except
the
milk
.
<EOS>
That
they
pays
for
weekly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
the
wife
has
disappeared
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
heard
about
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
do
say
,
sir
,
that
they
'
ad
<EOS>
some
words
together
the
other
day
,
and
that
the
woman
's
took
herself
off
in
a
tantrum
.
<EOS>
Only
you
ca
n't
believe
all
you
'
ear
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
they
often
quarrel
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
to
my
knowledge
,
sir
.
<EOS>
They
were
really
very
quiet
,
respectable
persons
for
foreigners
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
repassed
the
house
of
the
dead
woman
,
and
then
regaining
the
busy
Camberwell
Road
<EOS>
I
took
an
omnibus
back
to
the
Hotel
Cecil
in
the
Strand
where
I
had
put
up
,
tired
and
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
I
ran
down
to
Chichester
,
and
after
some
difficulty
found
the
Cheverton
College
for
Ladies
,
a
big
old
-
fashioned
house
about
half
-
a
-
mile
out
of
the
town
on
the
Drayton
Road
.
<EOS>
The
seminary
was
evidently
a
first
-
class
one
,
for
when
I
entered
I
noticed
how
well
everything
was
kept
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
principal
,
an
elderly
lady
of
a
somewhat
severe
aspect
,
I
said
:
 
"
I
regret
,
<EOS>
madam
,
to
trouble
you
,
but
I
am
in
search
of
information
you
can
supply
.
<EOS>
It
is
with
regard
to
a
certain
Elma
Heath
whom
you
had
as
pupil
here
,
and
who
left
,
I
believe
,
about
two
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Her
parents
lived
in
Durham
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
her
perfectly
,
"
was
the
woman
's
response
as
she
sat
behind
the
big
desk
,
having
apparently
at
first
expected
that
I
had
a
daughter
to
put
to
school
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
,
"
there
has
been
some
little
friction
in
the
family
,
and
I
am
making
inquiries
on
behalf
of
another
branch
of
it
--
an
aunt
who
desires
to
ascertain
the
girl
's
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
regret
,
sir
,
that
I
can
not
tell
you
that
.
<EOS>
The
Baron
,
her
uncle
,
came
here
one
day
and
took
her
away
suddenly
--
abroad
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Had
she
<EOS>
no
school
-
friend
to
whom
she
would
probably
write
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
girl
named
Leithcourt
--
Muriel
Leithcourt
--
who
was
her
friend
,
but
who
has
also
left
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
<EOS>
And
no
one
else
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Girls
often
write
to
each
other
after
leaving
school
,
until
they
get
married
,
and
then
the
correspondence
usually
ceases
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
principal
was
silent
and
reflective
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
"
there
was
another
pupil
who
was
also
on
friendly
terms
with
Elma
--
a
girl
named
Lydia
Moreton
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
written
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
you
really
desire
to
know
,
sir
,
I
dare
say
I
could
find
her
address
.
<EOS>
She
left
us
about
nine
months
after
Elma
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
esteem
it
<EOS>
a
great
favor
if
you
would
give
me
that
young
lady
's
address
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
,
whereupon
she
unlocked
a
drawer
in
her
writing
-
table
and
took
therefrom
a
thick
,
leather
-
bound
book
which
she
consulted
for
a
few
minutes
,
at
last
exclaiming
:
 
"
Yes
,
here
it
is--'Lydia
<EOS>
Moreton
,
daughter
of
Sir
Hamilton
Moreton
,
K.C.M.G.
,
Whiston
Grange
,
Doncaster
.
'
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
she
scribbled
it
in
pencil
upon
an
envelope
,
and
handing
it
to
me
,
said
:
 
"
Elma
Heath
was
,
I
fear
,
somewhat
neglected
by
her
parents
.
<EOS>
She
remained
here
for
five
years
,
and
had
no
holidays
like
the
other
girls
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
,
the
Baron
,
came
to
see
her
several
times
,
but
on
each
occasion
after
he
had
left
I
found
her
crying
in
secret
.
<EOS>
He
was
mean
and
unkind
to
her
.
<EOS>
Now
that
I
recollect
,
I
remember
that
Lydia
had
said
she
had
received
a
letter
from
her
,
therefore
she
might
be
able
to
give
you
some
information
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
that
I
took
my
leave
,
thanking
her
,
and
returned
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
Could
Lydia
<EOS>
Moreton
furnish
any
information
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
might
find
this
girl
whose
photograph
had
aroused
the
irate
jealousy
of
the
mysterious
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
The
ten
o'clock
Edinburgh
express
from
King
's
Cross
next
morning
took
me
up
to
Doncaster
,
and
hiring
a
musty
old
fly
at
the
station
<EOS>
,
I
drove
three
miles
out
of
the
town
on
the
Rotherham
Road
,
finding
Whiston
Grange
to
be
a
fine
old
Elizabethan
mansion
in
the
center
of
a
great
park
,
with
tall
old
twisted
chimneys
,
and
beautifully
-
kept
gardens
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
descended
at
the
door
and
rang
,
the
footman
was
not
aware
whether
Miss
Lydia
was
in
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
somewhat
suspiciously
,
I
thought
,
until
I
gave
my
card
and
impressed
upon
him
meaningly
that
I
had
come
from
London
purposely
to
see
his
young
mistress
upon
a
very
important
matter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
her
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
I
wish
to
see
her
regarding
her
friend
,
Miss
Elma
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Elma
'
Eath
,
"
repeated
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Will
you
walk
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
followed
him
across
the
big
old
oak
-
paneled
hall
,
filled
with
trophies
of
the
chase
and
arms
of
the
civil
wars
,
into
a
small
paneled
room
on
the
left
,
the
deep
-
set
window
with
its
diamond
panes
giving
out
upon
the
old
bowling
-
green
and
the
flower
-
garden
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
the
door
opened
,
and
a
tall
dark
-
haired
girl
in
white
entered
with
an
enquiring
expression
upon
her
face
as
she
halted
and
bowed
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lydia
Moreton
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
I
commenced
,
and
as
she
replied
in
the
affirmative
I
went
on
:
"
<EOS>
I
have
first
to
apologize
for
coming
to
you
,
but
Miss
Sotheby
,
the
principal
of
the
school
at
Chichester
,
referred
me
to
you
for
information
as
to
the
present
whereabouts
of
Miss
Elma
Heath
,
who
,
I
believe
,
was
one
of
your
most
intimate
friends
at
school
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
added
a
lie
,
saying
:
"
I
am
trying
,
on
behalf
of
an
aunt
of
hers
,
to
discover
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
responded
the
girl
,
"
I
have
had
only
one
or
two
letters
.
<EOS>
She
's
in
her
uncle
's
hands
,
I
believe
,
and
he
wo
n't
let
her
write
,
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
She
dreaded
leaving
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
she
would
never
say
.
<EOS>
She
had
some
deep
-
rooted
terror
of
her
uncle
,
Baron
Oberg
,
who
lived
in
St.
Petersburg
,
and
who
came
over
at
long
intervals
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
But
possibly
you
know
the
whole
story
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
,
"
I
cried
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
furthering
her
interests
,
as
well
as
doing
me
a
great
personal
favor
,
if
you
will
tell
me
what
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
little
,
"
she
answered
,
leaning
back
against
the
edge
of
the
table
and
regarding
me
seriously
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Elma
!
<EOS>
Her
people
treated
her
very
badly
indeed
.
<EOS>
They
sent
her
no
money
,
and
allowed
her
no
holidays
,
and
yet
she
was
the
sweetest
-
tempered
and
most
patient
girl
in
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
--
and
the
story
regarding
her
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
supposed
that
her
people
at
Durham
did
not
exist
,
"
she
explained
.
<EOS>
"
Elma
had
evidently
lived
a
greater
part
of
her
life
abroad
,
for
she
could
speak
French
and
Italian
better
than
the
professor
himself
,
and
therefore
always
won
the
prizes
.
<EOS>
The
class
revolted
,
and
then
she
did
not
compete
any
more
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
never
told
us
of
where
she
had
lived
when
a
child
.
<EOS>
She
came
from
Durham
,
she
said
--
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
a
letter
from
her
after
the
Baron
came
and
took
her
away
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
from
London
.
<EOS>
She
said
that
she
had
been
to
several
plays
and
concerts
,
but
did
not
care
for
life
in
town
.
<EOS>
There
was
too
much
bustle
and
noise
and
study
of
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
other
letters
did
you
receive
from
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Three
or
four
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
from
places
abroad
.
<EOS>
One
was
from
Vienna
,
one
was
from
Milan
,
and
one
from
some
place
with
an
unpronounceable
name
in
Hungary
.
<EOS>
The
last----
"
 
"
Yes
,
the
last
?
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
eagerly
,
interrupting
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
the
last
I
received
only
a
fortnight
ago
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
wait
a
moment
I
will
go
and
get
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
strange
that
I
have
n't
destroyed
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
went
out
,
and
I
heard
by
the
frou
-
frou
of
her
skirts
that
she
was
ascending
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
After
five
minutes
of
breathless
anxiety
she
rejoined
me
,
and
handing
me
the
letter
to
read
,
said
:
 
"
It
is
not
in
her
handwriting
--
I
wonder
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
paper
was
of
foreign
make
,
with
blue
lines
ruled
in
squares
.
<EOS>
Written
in
a
hand
that
was
evidently
foreign
,
for
the
mistakes
in
the
orthography
<EOS>
were
many
,
was
the
following
curious
communication
:
 
"
My
Dear
Lydia
:
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
may
never
get
this
letter
--
the
last
I
shall
ever
be
able
to
send
you
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
run
great
risks
in
sending
it
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
the
awful
disaster
that
has
happened
to
me
,
all
the
terrors
and
the
tortures
I
endure
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
can
assist
me
,
and
I
am
now
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
it
will
all
be
over
.
<EOS>
Do
you
recollect
our
old
peaceful
days
in
the
garden
at
Chichester
?
<EOS>
I
think
of
them
always
,
always
,
and
compare
that
sweet
peace
of
the
past
with
my
own
terrible
sufferings
of
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
how
I
wish
I
might
see
you
once
again
;
how
that
I
might
feel
your
hand
upon
my
brow
,
and
hear
your
words
of
hope
and
encouragement
!
<EOS>
But
happiness
is
now
debarred
from
me
,
and
I
am
only
sinking
to
the
grave
under
this
slow
torture
of
body
and
of
soul
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
will
pass
through
many
hands
before
it
reaches
the
post
.
<EOS>
If
,
however
,
it
ever
does
get
despatched
and
you
receive
it
,
will
you
do
me
one
last
favor
--
a
favor
to
an
unfortunate
girl
who
is
friendless
and
helpless
,
and
who
will
no
longer
trouble
the
world
?
<EOS>
It
is
this
:
Take
this
letter
to
London
,
and
call
upon
Mr.
Martin
Woodroffe
at
98
Cork
Street
,
Piccadilly
.
<EOS>
Show
him
my
letter
,
and
tell
him
from
me
that
through
it
all
I
have
kept
my
promise
,
and
that
the
secret
is
still
safe
.
<EOS>
He
will
understand
--
and
also
know
why
I
can
not
write
this
with
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
abroad
,
keep
it
until
he
returns
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
I
ask
of
you
,
Lydia
,
and
I
know
that
if
this
reaches
you
,
you
will
not
refuse
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
my
only
friend
and
confidante
,
but
I
now
bid
you
farewell
,
for
the
unknown
beckons
me
,
and
from
the
grave
I
can
not
write
.
<EOS>
Again
farewell
,
and
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
loving
and
affectionate
friend
,
 
"
Elma
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
very
strange
letter
,
is
it
not
?
"
remarked
the
girl
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
You
see
there
is
no
address
,
but
the
postmark
is
Russian
.
<EOS>
She
is
evidently
in
Russia
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
Finland
,
"
I
said
,
examining
the
stamp
and
making
out
the
post
town
to
be
Abo
.
"
<EOS>
But
have
you
been
to
London
and
executed
this
strange
commission
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
We
are
going
up
next
week
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
call
upon
this
person
named
Woodroffe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
made
no
remark
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
I
knew
,
abroad
,
but
I
was
glad
at
having
obtained
two
very
important
clues
:
<EOS>
first
,
the
address
of
the
mysterious
yachtsman
,
Woodroffe
,
alias
Hornby
,
and
,
secondly
,
ascertaining
that
the
young
girl
I
sought
was
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
town
of
Abo
,
the
Finnish
port
on
the
Baltic
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Elma
,
you
see
,
speaks
in
her
letter
of
some
secret
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
my
companion
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
says
she
wishes
this
Mr.
Woodroffe
,
whoever
he
is
,
to
know
that
she
has
kept
her
promise
and
has
not
divulged
it
.
<EOS>
This
only
bears
out
what
I
have
all
along
suspected
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
your
suspicions
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
from
her
deep
,
thoughtful
manner
,
and
from
certain
remarks
<EOS>
she
at
times
made
to
me
,
I
believe
that
Elma
is
in
possession
of
some
great
and
terrible
secret
--
a
secret
which
her
uncle
,
Baron
Oberg
,
is
desirous
of
learning
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
holds
him
in
deadly
fear
--
she
is
in
terror
that
she
may
inadvertently
betray
to
him
the
truth
!

CHAPTER
IX
 
<EOS>
STRANGE
DISCLOSURES
<EOS>
ARE
MADE
  
<EOS>
The
strange
letter
of
Elma
Heath
,
combined
with
what
Lydia
Moreton
had
told
me
,
aroused
within
me
a
determination
to
investigate
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
From
the
moment
I
had
landed
from
the
_
Lola
_
on
that
hot
,
breathless
night
at
Leghorn
,
mystery
had
crowded
upon
mystery
until
it
was
all
bewildering
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
proved
that
the
sweet
-
faced
girl
,
the
original
of
the
torn
photograph
,
held
a
secret
,
and
that
,
by
her
own
words
,
she
knew
that
death
was
approaching
.
<EOS>
The
incomprehensible
attempt
upon
my
life
,
the
strange
actions
of
Hornby
and
Chater
--
who
,
by
the
way
,
seemed
to
have
entirely
disappeared
--
the
assassination
of
the
man
who
by
masquerading
as
the
Italian
waiter
had
met
his
death
,
and
the
murder
of
Olinto
's
wife
were
all
problems
which
required
solution
.
 
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
the
mystery
of
it
all
--
and
mystery
ever
arouses
the
human
curiosity
--
I
should
have
given
up
trying
to
get
at
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Yet
as
a
man
with
some
leisure
,
and
knowing
by
that
letter
of
Elma
Heath
's
that
she
was
in
sore
distress
,
I
redoubled
my
efforts
to
ascertain
the
reason
of
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
mystery
of
the
_
Lola
_
was
still
a
mystery
along
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
At
every
French
and
Italian
port
the
yacht
's
false
name
and
general
build
was
written
in
the
police
-
books
,
while
at
Lloyd
's
the
name
_
Lola
_
was
marked
down
as
among
the
mysterious
craft
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Chater
was
missing
,
while
Hornby
was
abroad
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
were
both
cruising
again
,
with
their
yacht
repainted
and
bearing
a
fresh
name
.
<EOS>
But
why
?
<EOS>
What
had
been
their
motive
?
 
<EOS>
Stirred
by
the
complete
mystery
which
now
seemed
to
enshroud
the
unfortunate
girl
,
I
set
before
myself
the
task
of
elucidating
it
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
I
had
remained
passive
rather
than
active
,
but
I
now
realized
by
that
curious
letter
that
at
least
one
woman
's
life
was
at
stake
--
that
Elma
Heath
was
in
possession
of
some
secret
.
 
<EOS>
On
leaving
Leghorn
I
had
given
up
all
hope
of
tracing
the
mysterious
yachtsman
,
and
had
left
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
Italian
police
.
<EOS>
But
,
without
any
effort
on
my
own
part
,
I
seemed
to
have
been
drawn
into
a
veritable
network
of
strange
incidents
,
all
of
which
combined
to
form
the
most
complete
and
remarkable
enigma
ever
presented
in
life
.
<EOS>
Surely
no
man
was
ever
confronted
by
so
many
mysteries
at
one
time
as
I
was
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
I
had
been
careful
not
to
show
my
hand
to
anyone
,
and
this
perhaps
gave
me
a
distinct
advantage
.
<EOS>
On
my
journey
back
to
London
,
as
the
train
swung
through
Peterborough
and
out
across
the
rich
level
lands
towards
Hitchin
,
I
recollected
Jack
Durnford
's
words
when
I
had
mentioned
the
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
What
,
I
wondered
,
<EOS>
did
he
know
?
 
<EOS>
Next
month
,
in
November
,
he
was
due
back
in
London
after
his
three
years
'
service
on
the
Mediterranean
station
.
<EOS>
Then
we
should
meet
in
a
few
weeks
I
hoped
.
<EOS>
Would
he
tell
me
anything
when
he
became
aware
of
all
I
knew
?
<EOS>
He
held
some
secret
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
his
secret
was
the
same
as
that
held
by
the
unfortunate
girl
in
far
-
off
,
dreary
Finland
?
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
the
house
in
Cork
Street
indicated
by
Elma
,
and
learned
from
the
old
commissionaire
who
acted
as
lift
-
man
and
porter
,
that
Mr.
Woodroffe
's
chambers
were
closed
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
E
's
nearly
always
away
,
sir
--
abroad
,
I
think
,
"
was
all
I
could
get
out
of
the
old
soldier
,
who
,
like
his
class
,
was
no
doubt
well
paid
to
keep
his
mouth
closed
.
 
<EOS>
For
two
days
I
lounged
about
Westbourne
Grove
watching
Ferrari
's
restaurant
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
busy
,
bustling
thoroughfare
,
with
so
many
shop
windows
as
excuses
for
loitering
,
the
task
was
easy
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
Olinto
came
regularly
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
worked
hard
all
day
,
and
left
at
nine
o'clock
at
night
,
taking
an
omnibus
home
from
Royal
Oak
.
<EOS>
His
exterior
was
calm
and
unconcerned
,
unlike
that
of
a
man
whose
devoted
wife
had
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
approached
him
and
explained
the
ghastly
truth
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
the
poor
woman
's
body
was
missing
.
 
<EOS>
Those
September
days
were
full
of
anxiety
for
me
.
<EOS>
Alone
and
unaided
I
was
trying
to
solve
one
of
the
greatest
of
problems
,
plunged
as
I
was
in
a
veritable
sea
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
see
Muriel
Leithcourt
,
and
to
question
her
further
regarding
Elma
Heath
.
<EOS>
Therefore
again
I
left
Euston
,
and
,
traveling
through
the
night
,
took
my
seat
at
the
breakfast
-
table
at
Greenlaw
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
George
,
who
was
sitting
alone
--
<EOS>
it
not
being
my
aunt
's
habit
to
appear
early
--
welcomed
me
,
and
then
in
his
bluff
manner
sniffed
and
exclaimed
:
 
"
Nice
goings
on
up
at
Rannoch
!
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
of
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
breathlessly
,
staring
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
suspicions
that
those
Leithcourts
were
utter
outsiders
turns
out
to
be
about
correct
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
's
a
very
funny
story
,
and
there
are
a
dozen
different
distorted
versions
of
it
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
from
what
I
can
gather
the
true
facts
are
these
:
About
seven
o'clock
the
night
before
last
,
as
Leithcourt
and
his
house
-
party
were
dressing
for
dinner
,
a
telegram
arrived
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Leithcourt
opened
it
,
and
at
once
went
off
into
hysterics
,
while
her
husband
,
in
a
breathless
hurry
,
slipped
off
his
evening
clothes
again
and
got
into
an
old
blue
serge
suit
,
tossed
a
few
things
into
a
bag
,
and
then
went
along
to
Muriel
's
room
to
urge
her
to
prepare
for
secret
flight
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Flight
!
"
I
gasped
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
have
they
gone
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
.
<EOS>
The
servants
have
described
the
whole
affair
down
in
the
village
,
so
there
's
no
doubt
about
it
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
showed
Muriel
the
telegram
and
urged
her
to
fly
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
refused
,
but
for
her
father
's
sake
was
induced
to
prepare
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
guests
were
in
ignorance
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
The
brougham
was
ordered
to
be
ready
in
the
stable
-
yard
and
not
to
go
round
,
while
Mrs.
Leithcourt
's
maid
tried
to
bring
the
lady
back
to
her
senses
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
himself
,
it
seemed
,
rushed
hither
and
thither
,
seizing
the
jewel
-
cases
of
his
wife
and
daughter
and
whatever
valuables
<EOS>
he
could
place
his
hand
upon
,
while
the
mother
and
daughter
were
putting
on
their
things
.
<EOS>
As
he
rushed
down
the
main
staircase
to
the
library
,
where
his
check
-
book
and
some
ready
cash
were
locked
in
the
safe
,
he
met
a
stranger
who
had
just
been
admitted
and
shown
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
closed
the
door
and
faced
him
.
<EOS>
What
afterwards
transpired
,
however
,
is
a
mystery
,
for
two
hours
later
,
after
he
and
the
two
women
had
escaped
,
leaving
the
house
-
party
to
their
own
diversions
,
the
stranger
was
found
locked
in
a
large
cupboard
and
insensible
.
<EOS>
The
sensation
was
a
tremendous
one
.
<EOS>
Cowan
,
the
doctor
,
was
called
,
and
declared
that
the
stranger
had
been
drugged
and
was
suffering
from
some
narcotic
.
<EOS>
The
servant
who
admitted
him
declared
that
the
man
had
said
he
had
an
appointment
with
his
master
,
and
that
no
card
was
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
gave
the
name
of
Chater
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Chater
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
starting
up
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
certain
of
that
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
what
Cowan
told
me
,
"
was
my
uncle
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
Only
I
've
heard
that
name
before
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
a
man
out
in
Italy
of
the
same
name
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
the
visitor
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
hospital
at
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
They
took
him
there
in
preference
to
leaving
him
alone
at
Rannoch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alone
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
Everyone
has
left
,
now
the
host
and
hostess
have
slipped
off
without
saying
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
Scandalous
affair
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
But
,
my
boy
,
you
'll
remember
that
I
always
said
I
did
n't
like
those
people
.
<EOS>
There
's
something
mysterious
about
them
,
I
feel
certain
.
<EOS>
That
telegram
gave
them
warning
of
the
visit
of
the
man
Chater
,
depend
upon
it
,
and
for
some
reason
they
're
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
transpired
between
the
two
men
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
And
these
are
people
who
've
been
taken
up
by
everybody
--
mere
adventurers
,
I
should
call
them
!
"
<EOS>
And
old
Sir
George
sniffed
again
at
thought
of
such
scandal
happening
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
"
If
Gilrae
must
let
Rannoch
,
then
why
in
the
name
of
Fortune
does
n't
he
let
it
to
respectable
folk
and
not
to
the
first
fellow
who
answers
his
advertisement
in
_
The
Field
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
It
's
simply
disgraceful
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
story
,
"
I
declared
.
<EOS>
"
Leithcourt
evidently
wished
to
escape
from
his
visitor
,
and
that
's
why
he
drugged
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
he
poisoned
him
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
Cowan
says
the
fellow
is
poisoned
,
but
that
he
'll
probably
recover
.
<EOS>
He
is
already
conscious
,
I
hear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
call
on
the
doctor
,
who
happened
to
be
well
known
to
me
,
and
obtain
further
particulars
.
<EOS>
Therefore
at
eleven
o'clock
I
drove
into
Dumfries
and
entered
his
consulting
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
spare
,
short
,
fair
man
,
a
trifle
bald
,
and
when
I
was
shown
in
he
welcomed
me
warmly
,
speaking
with
his
pronounced
Galloway
accent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
is
a
very
mysterious
case
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
he
said
,
after
I
had
told
him
the
object
of
my
visit
.
"
<EOS>
The
gentleman
is
still
in
the
hospital
,
and
I
have
to
keep
him
very
quiet
.
<EOS>
He
was
poisoned
without
a
doubt
,
and
has
had
a
very
narrow
escape
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
police
got
wind
of
the
affair
,
and
Mackenzie
called
to
question
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
refused
to
make
any
statement
whatever
,
apparently
treating
the
affair
very
lightly
.
<EOS>
The
police
,
however
,
are
mystified
as
to
the
reason
of
Mr.
Leithcourt
's
sudden
flight
,
and
are
anxious
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
curious
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Naturally
.
<EOS>
And
more
especially
after
the
tragedy
up
in
Rannoch
Wood
a
short
time
ago
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
it
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
removing
his
pince
-
nez
and
rubbing
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mackenzie
seems
to
suspect
some
connection
between
Leithcourt
's
sudden
disappearance
and
that
mysterious
affair
.
<EOS>
It
seems
very
evident
that
the
telegram
was
a
warning
to
Leithcourt
of
the
man
<EOS>
Chater
's
intention
of
calling
,
and
that
the
last
-
named
was
shown
in
just
at
the
moment
when
the
fugitive
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
.
"
 
"
Chater
.
<EOS>
"
I
echoed
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
his
Christian
name
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hylton
Chater
.
<EOS>
He
is
apparently
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Curious
that
he
will
tell
us
nothing
of
the
reason
he
called
,
and
of
the
scene
that
occurred
between
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Knowing
all
that
I
did
,
I
was
not
surprised
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
had
undoubtedly
taken
him
unawares
,
but
knights
of
industry
never
betray
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
My
next
visit
was
to
Mackenzie
,
for
whom
I
had
to
wait
nearly
an
hour
,
as
he
was
absent
in
another
quarter
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr.
Gregg
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
gladly
,
as
he
came
in
to
find
me
seated
in
a
chair
patiently
reading
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
very
person
I
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
of
this
strange
affair
at
Rannoch
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
was
my
answer
.
"
<EOS>
Has
the
man
in
the
hospital
made
any
statement
yet
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
.
<EOS>
He
refuses
point
-
blank
,
"
answered
the
detective
.
<EOS>
"
But
my
own
idea
is
that
the
affair
has
a
very
close
connection
with
the
two
mysteries
of
the
wood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
first
mystery
--
<EOS>
that
of
the
man
--
proves
to
be
a
double
mystery
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
<EOS>
Explain
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
the
waiter
Olinto
Santini
is
alive
and
well
in
London
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
he
gasped
,
starting
up
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
is
not
the
person
you
identified
him
to
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
masquerading
as
Santini
--
made
up
to
resemble
him
,
I
mean
,
even
to
the
mole
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
identified
him
positively
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
a
person
is
dead
it
is
very
easy
to
mistake
countenances
.
<EOS>
Death
alters
the
countenance
so
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
he
said
reflectively
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
the
man
we
've
buried
is
not
the
Italian
,
then
the
mystery
is
considerably
increased
.
<EOS>
Why
was
the
real
man
's
wife
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
where
has
her
body
been
concealed
?
<EOS>
That
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Again
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
We
have
made
a
thorough
search
for
four
days
,
without
discovering
any
trace
of
it
.
<EOS>
Quite
confidentially
,
I
'm
wondering
if
this
man
Chater
knows
anything
.
<EOS>
It
is
curious
,
to
say
the
least
,
that
the
Leithcourts
should
have
fled
so
hurriedly
on
this
man
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
have
you
actually
seen
Olinto
Santini
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
and
have
spoken
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
sent
up
to
London
asking
that
inquiries
should
be
made
at
the
restaurant
in
Bayswater
,
but
up
to
the
present
I
have
received
no
report
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
chatted
with
Olinto
.
<EOS>
His
wife
has
mysteriously
disappeared
,
but
he
is
in
ignorance
that
she
is
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
tell
him
anything
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
did
well
.
<EOS>
There
is
widespread
conspiracy
here
,
depend
upon
it
,
Mr.
Gregg
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
an
interesting
case
when
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
this
fellow
Chater
would
tell
us
the
reason
he
called
upon
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Merely
that
he
has
no
wish
to
prosecute
,
and
that
he
has
no
statement
to
make
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
compel
him
to
say
something
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
infernal
difficulty
of
it
.
<EOS>
If
he
do
n't
choose
to
speak
,
then
we
must
still
remain
in
ignorance
,
although
I
feel
confident
that
he
knows
something
of
the
strange
affair
up
in
the
wood
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
although
I
was
silent
,
I
shared
the
Scotch
detective
's
belief
.
 
<EOS>
The
afternoon
was
chill
and
wet
as
I
climbed
the
hill
to
Greenlaw
.
 
<EOS>
The
sudden
disappearance
of
the
tenants
of
Rannoch
was
,
I
found
,
on
everyone
's
tongue
in
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
In
the
smoke
-
room
of
the
railway
hotel
three
men
were
discussing
it
with
many
grimaces
and
sinister
hints
,
and
the
talkative
young
woman
behind
the
bar
asked
me
my
opinion
of
the
strange
goings
-
on
up
at
the
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
walked
on
alone
,
with
the
dark
line
of
woods
crowning
the
hill
-
top
before
me
,
the
scene
of
that
double
tragedy
,
I
again
calmly
reviewed
the
situation
.
<EOS>
I
longed
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
see
Hylton
Chater
,
yet
when
I
recollected
the
part
he
had
played
with
Hornby
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
,
I
naturally
hesitated
.
<EOS>
He
was
allied
with
Hornby
,
apparently
against
Leithcourt
,
although
the
latter
was
Hornby
's
friend
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
I
wondered
,
had
transpired
in
the
library
of
that
gray
old
castle
which
stood
out
boldly
before
me
,
dark
and
grim
,
as
I
plodded
on
through
the
rain
?
<EOS>
How
had
Leithcourt
succeeded
in
rendering
his
enemy
insensible
and
hiding
him
in
that
cupboard
?
<EOS>
Did
he
believe
that
he
had
killed
him
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
went
boldly
to
Chater
,
then
it
would
only
be
the
betrayal
of
myself
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
decided
that
the
man
who
had
smoked
and
chatted
with
me
so
affably
on
that
hot
,
breathless
night
in
the
Mediterranean
must
remain
in
ignorance
of
my
presence
,
or
of
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
stayed
for
a
week
at
Greenlaw
with
eyes
and
ears
ever
open
,
yet
exercising
care
that
the
patient
in
the
hospital
should
be
unaware
of
my
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Mackenzie
saw
him
on
several
occasions
,
but
he
still
persisted
in
that
tantalizing
silence
.
<EOS>
The
inquiry
into
the
death
of
the
unidentified
man
in
Rannoch
Wood
had
been
resumed
,
and
a
verdict
returned
of
willful
murder
against
some
person
unknown
,
while
of
the
second
crime
the
public
had
no
knowledge
,
for
the
body
was
not
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
Time
after
time
I
searched
the
wood
alone
,
on
the
pretense
of
shooting
pigeon
,
but
discovered
nothing
.
<EOS>
When
not
having
sport
on
my
uncle
's
property
,
I
joined
various
parties
in
the
neighborhood
,
not
because
Scotland
at
that
time
attracted
me
,
but
because
I
desired
to
watch
events
.
 
<EOS>
Chater
,
as
soon
as
he
recovered
,
left
the
hospital
and
went
south
--
to
London
,
I
ascertained
--
leaving
the
police
utterly
in
the
dark
and
filled
with
suspicion
of
the
fugitives
from
Rannoch
.
 
<EOS>
I
longed
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
Muriel
,
hoping
to
gain
from
her
some
information
regarding
their
visitor
who
had
so
nearly
escaped
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
aware
of
the
object
of
his
visit
was
plain
from
the
statements
of
the
servants
,
all
of
whom
had
been
left
without
either
money
or
orders
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
I
called
at
the
castle
,
the
front
entrance
of
which
I
found
closed
.
<EOS>
Gilrae
,
the
owner
,
had
come
up
from
London
,
met
his
factor
there
,
and
discharged
all
the
late
tenant
's
servants
,
keeping
on
only
three
of
his
own
who
had
been
in
service
there
for
a
number
of
years
.
<EOS>
Ann
Cameron
,
a
housemaid
,
was
one
of
these
,
and
it
was
she
whom
I
met
when
entering
by
the
servants
'
hall
.
 
<EOS>
On
questioning
her
,
I
found
her
most
willing
to
describe
how
she
was
in
the
corridor
outside
the
young
mistress
's
room
when
Mr.
Leithcourt
dashed
along
in
breathless
haste
with
the
telegram
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
heard
him
cry
:
"
<EOS>
Look
at
this
!
<EOS>
Read
it
,
Muriel
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
.
<EOS>
Put
on
your
things
at
once
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
about
luggage
.
<EOS>
Every
minute
lost
is
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
a
moment
later
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
go
?
<EOS>
You
'll
stay
here
--
stay
here
and
face
them
?
<EOS>
Good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
girl
,
are
you
mad
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
what
this
means
?
<EOS>
It
means
that
the
secret
is
out
--
the
secret
is
out
,
you
hear
!
<EOS>
We
must
fly
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
woman
told
me
that
she
distinctly
heard
Miss
Muriel
sobbing
,
while
her
father
walked
up
and
down
the
room
speaking
rapidly
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
Then
he
came
out
again
and
returned
to
his
dressing
-
room
,
while
Miss
Muriel
presumably
changed
from
her
evening
-
gown
into
a
dark
traveling
-
dress
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
she
say
anything
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
that
they
were
called
away
suddenly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
the
domestic
added
,
"
the
young
lady
was
very
pale
and
agitated
,
and
we
all
knew
that
something
terrible
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Leithcourt
gave
orders
that
nothing
was
to
be
told
to
the
guests
,
who
dined
alone
,
believing
that
their
host
and
hostess
had
gone
down
to
the
village
to
see
an
old
man
who
was
dying
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
story
we
told
them
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
in
the
meantime
the
Leithcourts
were
in
the
express
going
to
Carlisle
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
They
say
in
Dumfries
that
the
police
telegraphed
after
them
,
but
they
had
reached
Carlisle
and
evidently
changed
there
,
and
so
got
away
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
the
administration
of
a
judicious
tip
I
was
allowed
to
go
up
to
Miss
Muriel
's
room
,
an
elegantly
furnished
little
chamber
in
the
front
of
the
fine
old
place
,
with
a
deep
old
-
fashioned
window
commanding
a
magnificent
view
across
the
broad
Nithsdale
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
had
been
tidied
by
the
maids
,
but
allowed
to
remain
just
as
she
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
I
advanced
to
the
window
,
in
which
was
set
the
large
dressing
-
table
with
its
big
swing
-
mirror
and
silver
-
topped
bottles
,
and
on
gazing
out
saw
,
to
my
surprise
,
it
was
the
only
window
which
gave
a
view
of
that
corner
of
Rannoch
Wood
where
the
double
tragedy
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
any
person
standing
at
the
spot
would
have
a
clear
view
of
that
one
distant
window
while
out
of
sight
of
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
A
light
might
be
placed
there
at
night
as
signal
,
for
instance
;
or
by
day
a
towel
might
be
hung
from
the
window
as
though
to
dry
and
yet
could
be
plainly
seen
at
that
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Another
object
in
the
room
also
attracted
my
attention
--
a
pair
of
long
field
-
glasses
.
<EOS>
Had
she
used
these
to
keep
watch
upon
that
spot
?
 
<EOS>
I
took
them
up
and
focused
them
upon
the
boundary
of
the
wood
,
finding
that
I
could
distinguish
everything
quite
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
where
they
found
the
man
who
was
murdered
,
"
explained
the
servant
,
who
still
stood
in
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
trying
the
glasses
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
put
them
down
,
and
on
turning
saw
upon
the
mantelshelf
a
small
,
bright
-
red
candleshade
,
which
I
took
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
made
,
I
found
,
to
fit
upon
the
electric
table
-
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Muriel
was
very
fond
of
a
red
light
,
"
explained
the
young
woman
;
and
as
I
held
it
<EOS>
I
wondered
if
that
light
had
ever
been
placed
upon
the
toilet
-
table
and
the
blind
drawn
up
--
whether
it
had
ever
been
used
as
a
warning
of
danger
?
 
<EOS>
As
I
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
young
lady
's
boudoir
,
the
maid
Cameron
took
me
down
to
the
luxurious
little
room
where
,
the
first
moment
I
entered
,
one
fact
struck
me
as
peculiar
.
<EOS>
The
picture
of
Elma
Heath
was
no
longer
there
.
<EOS>
The
photograph
had
been
taken
from
its
frame
,
and
in
its
place
was
the
portrait
of
a
broad
-
browed
,
full
-
bearded
man
in
a
foreign
military
uniform
--
a
picture
that
,
being
soiled
and
faded
,
had
evidently
been
placed
there
to
fill
the
empty
frame
.
 
<EOS>
Whose
hand
had
secured
that
portrait
before
the
Leithcourt
's
flight
?
<EOS>
Why
,
indeed
,
should
I
,
for
the
second
time
,
discover
the
unhappy
girl
's
picture
missing
?
 
<EOS>
"
Has
the
gentleman
who
called
on
the
evening
of
Mr.
Leithcourt
's
disappearance
been
back
here
again
since
he
left
the
hospital
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
as
a
sudden
idea
occurred
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
called
here
in
a
fly
on
the
day
he
came
out
,
and
at
his
request
I
took
him
over
the
castle
.
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
library
,
and
spent
half
-
an
-
hour
in
pacing
across
it
,
taking
measurements
,
and
examining
the
big
cupboard
in
which
he
was
found
insensible
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
affair
,
sir
,
"
added
the
young
woman
,
"
was
n't
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
might
have
been
in
there
now
had
I
not
gone
into
the
library
and
found
a
lot
of
illustrated
papers
,
which
I
always
put
in
the
cupboard
to
keep
the
place
tidy
,
thrown
out
on
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
put
them
back
but
discovered
the
door
locked
.
<EOS>
The
key
I
afterwards
found
in
the
grate
,
where
Mr.
Leithcourt
had
evidently
thrown
it
,
and
on
opening
the
door
imagine
the
shock
I
had
when
I
found
the
visitor
lying
doubled
up
.
<EOS>
I
,
of
course
,
thought
he
was
dead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
when
he
returned
here
on
his
recovery
,
did
he
question
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
He
asked
about
the
Leithcourts
,
and
especially
about
Miss
Muriel
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
's
rather
sweet
on
her
,
by
the
way
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
And
really
no
better
or
kinder
lady
never
breathed
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
We
're
all
very
sorry
indeed
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
But
she
shares
in
the
scandal
and
disgrace
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
seen
the
effect
of
the
news
upon
the
guests
when
they
knew
that
the
Leithcourts
had
gone
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
regular
pandemonium
.
<EOS>
They
ordered
the
best
champagne
out
of
the
cellars
and
drank
it
,
the
men
cleared
all
the
cigar
-
boxes
,
and
the
women
rummaged
in
the
wardrobes
until
they
seemed
like
a
pack
of
hungry
wolves
.
<EOS>
Everybody
went
away
with
their
trunks
full
of
the
Leithcourt
's
things
.
<EOS>
They
took
whatever
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
,
and
we
,
the
servants
,
could
n't
stop
them
.
<EOS>
I
did
remonstrate
with
one
lady
who
was
cramming
into
her
trunk
two
of
Miss
Muriel
's
best
evening
dresses
,
but
she
told
me
to
mind
my
own
business
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
One
man
I
saw
go
away
with
four
of
Mr.
Leithcourt
's
guns
,
and
there
was
a
regular
squabble
in
the
billiard
-
room
over
a
set
of
pearl
and
emerald
dress
-
studs
that
somebody
found
in
his
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Crane
,
the
valet
,
says
they
tossed
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Disgraceful
!
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
Then
as
soon
as
the
host
and
hostess
had
gone
,
they
simply
swept
through
the
rooms
and
cleared
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
They
took
away
all
that
was
most
valuable
.
<EOS>
They
'd
have
had
the
silver
,
only
Mason
had
thrown
it
into
the
plate
-
chest
,
all
dirty
as
it
was
,
locked
it
up
and
hid
the
key
.
<EOS>
The
plate
was
Mr.
Gilrae
's
,
you
know
,
sir
,
and
Mason
was
responsible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
acted
wisely
,
"
I
said
,
surprised
at
the
domestic
's
story
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
guests
acted
like
a
gang
of
thieves
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
,
sir
.
<EOS>
They
rushed
all
over
the
house
like
demons
let
loose
,
and
they
even
stole
some
of
our
things
.
<EOS>
I
lost
a
silver
chain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
the
stranger
say
when
you
told
him
of
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
smiled
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
seem
to
surprise
him
in
the
least
,
for
after
all
his
visit
was
the
cause
of
<EOS>
the
sudden
breaking
up
of
the
party
,
was
n't
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
did
you
show
him
over
the
whole
house
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
responded
the
servant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Curiously
enough
he
had
with
him
what
seemed
to
be
a
large
plan
of
the
castle
,
and
as
we
went
from
room
to
room
he
compared
it
with
his
plan
.
<EOS>
He
was
here
for
hours
,
and
told
me
he
wanted
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
the
place
and
did
n't
want
to
be
disturbed
.
<EOS>
He
also
said
that
he
might
probably
take
the
place
for
next
season
,
if
he
liked
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
however
,
he
only
told
me
this
because
he
thought
I
would
be
more
patient
while
he
took
his
measurements
and
made
his
investigations
.
<EOS>
He
was
here
from
twelve
till
nearly
six
o'clock
,
and
went
through
every
room
,
even
up
to
the
turrets
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
came
into
this
room
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
she
responded
,
with
just
a
slight
hesitation
,
I
thought
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
the
room
where
he
stayed
the
longest
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
photograph
in
that
frame
over
there
,
"
she
added
,
indicating
the
frame
that
had
held
the
picture
of
Elma
Heath
,
"
a
portrait
of
a
young
lady
,
which
he
begged
me
to
give
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
gave
it
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
--
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
begged
so
hard
for
it
,
saying
that
it
was
the
portrait
of
a
friend
of
his
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
gave
you
something
handsome
for
it
--
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
woman
,
whom
I
knew
could
not
refuse
half
-
a
-
sovereign
,
colored
slightly
and
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
put
that
picture
in
its
place
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
found
it
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
tell
you
who
the
young
lady
was
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
only
said
that
that
was
the
only
photograph
that
existed
,
and
that
she
was
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
,
staring
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
That
was
why
he
was
so
anxious
for
the
picture
.
"
 
<EOS>
Elma
Heath
dead
!
<EOS>
Could
it
be
true
?
<EOS>
That
sweet
-
pictured
face
haunted
me
as
no
other
face
had
ever
impressed
itself
upon
my
memory
.
<EOS>
It
somehow
seemed
to
impel
me
to
endeavor
to
penetrate
the
mystery
,
and
yet
Hylton
Chater
had
declared
that
she
was
dead
!
<EOS>
I
recollected
the
remarkable
letter
from
Abo
,
and
her
own
declaration
that
her
end
was
near
.
<EOS>
That
letter
was
,
she
said
,
the
last
she
should
write
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Did
Hylton
Chater
actually
possess
knowledge
of
the
girl
's
death
?
<EOS>
Had
he
all
along
been
acquainted
with
her
whereabouts
?
<EOS>
What
the
young
woman
told
me
upset
all
my
plans
.
<EOS>
If
Elma
Heath
were
really
dead
,
then
she
was
beyond
discovery
,
and
the
truth
would
be
hidden
forever
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
he
had
put
the
photograph
in
his
pocket
,
the
gentleman
made
a
most
minute
search
in
this
room
,
"
the
domestic
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
He
consulted
his
plan
,
took
several
measurements
,
and
then
tapped
on
the
paneling
all
along
this
wall
,
as
though
he
were
searching
for
some
hidden
cupboard
or
hiding
place
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
plan
,
and
saw
a
mark
in
red
ink
upon
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
trying
to
discover
that
spot
,
and
was
greatly
disappointed
at
not
being
able
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
here
over
an
hour
,
and
made
a
most
careful
search
all
around
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
explanation
did
he
give
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
only
said
,
'
If
I
find
what
I
want
,
Ann
,
I
shall
make
you
a
present
of
a
ten
-
pound
note
.
'
<EOS>
That
naturally
made
me
anxious
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
made
no
other
remark
about
the
young
lady
's
death
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
Only
he
sighed
,
and
looked
steadily
for
a
long
time
at
the
photograph
.
<EOS>
I
saw
his
lips
moving
,
but
his
words
were
inaudible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
any
idea
of
the
reason
why
he
called
upon
Mr.
Leithcourt
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
From
what
he
said
,
I
've
formed
my
own
conclusions
,
"
was
her
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
your
opinion
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
feel
certain
that
there
is
,
or
was
,
something
concealed
in
this
house
that
he
's
very
anxious
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
demand
it
of
Mr.
Leithcourt
,
but
what
happened
in
the
library
we
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
believes
that
Mr.
Leithcourt
has
not
taken
it
away
,
and
that
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
it
is
still
hidden
here
.

<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
X
 
<EOS>
I
SHOW
MY
HAND
  
<EOS>
On
my
return
to
London
next
day
I
made
inquiry
at
the
Admiralty
and
learned
that
the
battleship
_
Bulwark
_
was
lying
at
Palermo
,
therefore
I
telegraphed
to
Jack
Durnford
,
and
late
the
same
afternoon
his
reply
came
at
the
Cecil:--
 
"
_
Due
in
London
twentieth
.
<EOS>
Dine
with
me
at
club
that
evening_--Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
twentieth
!
<EOS>
That
meant
nearly
a
month
of
inactivity
.
<EOS>
In
that
time
I
could
cross
to
Abo
,
make
inquiries
there
,
and
ascertain
,
perhaps
,
if
Elma
Heath
were
actually
dead
as
Chater
had
declared
.
 
<EOS>
Two
facts
struck
me
as
remarkable
:
Baron
Oberg
was
said
to
be
Polish
,
while
the
dark
-
bearded
proprietor
of
the
restaurant
in
Westbourne
Grove
was
also
of
the
same
nationality
.
<EOS>
Then
I
recollected
that
pretty
little
enameled
cross
that
Mackenzie
had
found
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
possibly
be
the
miniature
of
one
of
the
European
orders
of
chivalry
.
<EOS>
In
the
club
library
at
midnight
I
found
a
copy
of
Cappelletti
's
_
Storia
degli
Ordini
Cavallereschi
_
,
the
standard
work
on
the
subject
,
and
on
searching
the
illustrations
<EOS>
I
at
length
discovered
a
picture
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
Russian
order
--
the
coveted
Order
of
Saint
Anne
,
bestowed
by
the
Czar
only
upon
persons
who
have
rendered
eminent
services
to
the
State
and
to
the
sovereign
.
<EOS>
One
fact
was
now
certain
,
namely
,
that
the
owner
of
that
tiny
cross
,
the
small
replica
of
the
fine
decoration
,
must
be
a
person
of
high
official
standing
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
I
spent
in
making
inquiries
with
a
view
to
discovering
the
house
said
to
be
occupied
by
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
not
either
in
the
Directory
or
the
Blue
Book
,
I
concluded
that
he
had
perhaps
rented
it
furnished
,
and
after
many
inquiries
and
considerable
difficulties
I
found
that
such
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
He
had
occupied
the
house
of
Lady
Heathcote
,
a
few
doors
from
Grosvenor
Square
,
for
the
previous
season
,
although
he
had
lived
there
but
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
Where
the
fugitives
were
in
hiding
I
had
no
idea
.
<EOS>
I
longed
to
meet
Muriel
again
and
tell
her
what
I
had
discovered
,
yet
it
was
plain
that
the
trio
were
concealing
themselves
from
Hylton
Chater
,
whom
I
supposed
to
be
now
back
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
autumn
days
were
dull
and
rainy
,
and
the
streets
were
muddy
and
unpleasant
,
as
they
always
are
at
the
fall
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
Compelled
to
remain
inactive
,
I
idled
in
the
club
with
the
recollection
of
that
pictured
face
ever
before
me
--
the
face
of
the
unfortunate
girl
who
wished
<EOS>
her
last
message
to
be
conveyed
to
Philip
Hornby
.
<EOS>
What
,
I
wondered
,
was
her
secret
?
<EOS>
What
was
really
her
fate
?
 
<EOS>
This
latter
question
troubled
me
until
I
could
bear
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
to
go
to
Finland
and
endeavor
to
learn
something
regarding
this
Baron
Oberg
and
his
niece
.
<EOS>
Frank
Hutcheson
had
written
me
declaring
that
the
weather
in
Leghorn
was
now
perfect
,
and
expressing
wonder
that
I
did
not
return
.
<EOS>
I
was
his
only
English
friend
,
and
I
knew
how
dull
he
was
when
alone
.
<EOS>
Even
his
Majesty
's
Consuls
sometimes
suffer
from
homesickness
,
and
long
for
the
smell
of
the
London
gutters
and
a
glass
of
homely
bitter
ale
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
,
my
reader
,
who
have
lived
in
a
foreign
land
for
any
length
of
time
,
know
<EOS>
well
how
wearisome
becomes
the
life
,
however
brilliant
,
and
how
sweet
are
the
recollections
of
our
dear
gray
old
England
with
her
green
fields
,
her
muddy
lanes
,
and
the
bustling
streets
of
her
gray
,
grimy
cities
.
<EOS>
You
have
but
one
"
home
,
"
and
England
Is
still
your
home
,
even
though
you
may
become
the
most
bigoted
of
cosmopolitans
and
may
have
no
opportunity
of
speaking
your
native
tongue
the
whole
year
through
.
 
<EOS>
Duty
--
the
duty
of
a
man
who
had
learned
strange
facts
and
knew
that
a
defenseless
woman
was
a
victim
--
called
me
to
Finland
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
with
my
passport
properly
vised
and
my
papers
all
in
order
,
I
one
night
left
Hull
for
Stockholm
by
the
weekly
Wilson
service
.
<EOS>
Four
days
of
rough
weather
in
the
North
Sea
and
the
Baltic
brought
me
to
the
Swedish
capital
,
whence
<EOS>
on
the
following
day
I
took
the
small
steamer
which
plies
three
times
a
week
around
the
Aland
Islands
,
and
then
across
the
Gulf
of
Bothnia
to
Korpo
,
and
through
the
intricate
channels
and
among
those
low
-
lying
islands
to
the
gray
lethargic
town
of
Abo
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
first
occasion
on
which
I
had
trod
Russian
soil
,
and
I
knew
too
well
the
annoyances
of
the
bureaucracy
.
<EOS>
Finland
,
however
,
is
perhaps
the
most
severely
governed
of
any
of
the
Czar
's
dominions
,
and
I
had
my
first
taste
of
its
stern
,
relentless
officialdom
at
the
moment
of
landing
on
the
half
-
deserted
quay
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
wooden
passport
office
<EOS>
the
uniformed
official
,
on
examining
my
passport
,
discovered
that
at
the
Russian
Consulate
-
General
they
had
forgotten
to
date
the
vise
which
had
been
impressed
with
a
rubber
stamp
.
<EOS>
It
was
signed
by
the
Consul
-
General
,
but
the
date
was
missing
,
whereupon
the
man
shook
his
head
and
handed
back
the
document
curtly
,
saying
in
Russian
,
which
I
understood
fairly
well
,
although
I
spoke
badly--
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
in
order
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
returned
to
London
and
dated
before
you
can
proceed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
not
my
fault
,
"
I
protested
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
fault
of
the
clerk
at
the
Consulate
-
General
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
examined
it
before
leaving
.
<EOS>
You
must
send
it
to
London
,
and
return
to
Stockholm
by
to
-
night
's
boat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
outrageous
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
cried
,
as
he
had
already
taken
the
papers
of
a
passenger
behind
me
and
was
looking
at
them
with
unconcern
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
glaring
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
return
to
-
night
,
or
if
you
choose
to
stay
you
will
be
arrested
for
landing
without
a
passport
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
go
back
!
<EOS>
"
I
declared
defiantly
.
"
<EOS>
Your
Consul
-
General
vised
my
passport
,
and
I
claim
,
under
international
law
,
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
without
hindrance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
steamer
leaves
at
six
o'clock
,
"
he
remarked
without
looking
up
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
in
Abo
after
that
it
will
be
at
your
own
risk
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
English
,
recollect
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
me
it
does
not
matter
what
or
who
you
are
.
<EOS>
Your
passport
,
undated
,
is
worthless
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
complain
to
the
Ambassador
at
Petersburg
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Ambassador
does
not
interest
me
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
Ambassador
here
in
Finland
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
Czar
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Who
is
ruler
in
this
country
,
pray
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Excellency
the
Governor
-
General
,
an
official
who
has
love
for
neither
England
nor
the
pigs
of
English
.
<EOS>
So
recollect
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
meaningly
,
"
I
shall
recollect
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
turned
and
went
out
of
the
little
wooden
office
,
replacing
my
passport
in
my
pocket
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
already
been
directed
to
the
hotel
,
and
walked
there
,
but
as
I
did
so
<EOS>
I
saw
that
I
was
already
under
the
surveillance
of
the
police
,
for
two
men
in
plain
clothes
who
were
lounging
outside
the
passport
-
office
strolled
on
after
me
,
evidently
to
watch
my
movements
.
<EOS>
Truly
Finland
was
under
the
iron
-
heel
of
autocracy
.
 
<EOS>
After
taking
my
rooms
,
I
strolled
about
the
flat
,
uninteresting
town
,
wondering
how
best
to
commence
my
search
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
but
a
photograph
to
show
people
it
would
give
me
a
great
advantage
,
but
I
had
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
,
indeed
,
set
eyes
upon
the
unfortunate
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Six
o'clock
came
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
steam
siren
of
the
departing
boat
bound
for
Sweden
,
but
I
was
determined
to
remain
there
at
whatever
cost
,
therefore
I
returned
to
the
hotel
,
and
at
seven
dined
comfortably
in
company
with
a
German
who
had
been
my
fellow
-
passenger
across
from
Stockholm
.
 
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
,
however
,
just
as
we
were
idling
over
dessert
,
two
gray
-
coated
police
officers
entered
and
arrested
me
on
the
serious
charge
of
landing
without
a
passport
.
 
<EOS>
I
accompanied
them
to
the
police
-
office
,
where
I
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
big
,
bristly
Russian
who
held
the
town
of
Abo
in
terror
,
the
Chief
of
Police
.
<EOS>
The
officials
which
Russia
sends
into
Finland
are
selected
for
their
harsh
discipline
and
hide
-
bound
bureaucracy
,
and
this
human
machine
in
uniform
was
no
exception
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
himself
,
he
could
not
have
been
more
self
-
opinionated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
he
snapped
,
looking
up
at
me
as
I
was
placed
before
him
.
"
<EOS>
Your
name
is
Gordon
Gregg
,
English
,
from
Stockholm
.
<EOS>
No
passport
,
and
decline
to
leave
even
though
warned
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
passport
,
"
I
said
firmly
,
producing
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
it
,
and
pointing
with
his
finger
,
said
:
"
It
has
no
date
,
and
is
therefore
worthless
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
fault
is
not
mine
,
but
that
of
a
Russian
official
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
it
to
be
dated
,
you
may
send
it
to
your
Consulate
-
General
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
,
"
he
cried
,
glaring
at
me
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
And
for
your
insult
to
the
law
,
I
shall
commit
you
to
prison
for
one
month
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
then
learn
Russian
manners
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
so
you
will
commit
an
Englishman
to
prison
for
a
month
,
without
trial
--
eh
?
<EOS>
That
's
very
interesting
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
if
you
attempt
such
a
thing
as
that
they
may
have
something
to
say
about
it
in
Petersburg
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
defy
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
have
presented
my
passport
and
demand
common
courtesy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
passport
is
worthless
,
I
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
that
's
how
much
it
is
worth
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
And
snatching
it
up
he
tore
it
in
half
and
tossed
the
pieces
of
blue
paper
in
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
My
blood
was
up
at
this
insult
,
yet
<EOS>
I
bit
my
lips
and
remained
quite
calm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
kindly
tell
me
who
you
are
?
"
<EOS>
I
asked
in
as
quiet
a
voice
as
I
could
command
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
am
Michael
Boranski
,
Chief
of
Police
of
the
Province
of
Abo
-
Biornebourg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Well
,
Michael
Boranski
,
I
shall
trouble
you
to
pick
up
my
passport
,
stick
it
together
again
,
and
apologize
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Apologize
!
<EOS>
Me
apologize
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
fellow
laughed
aloud
,
while
the
police
officers
on
either
side
of
me
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
refuse
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Refuse
?
<EOS>
Certainly
I
do
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
then
,
"
I
said
,
re
-
opening
my
pocket
-
book
and
taking
out
an
open
letter
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
kindly
glance
at
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
Russian
,
so
you
can
read
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
snatched
it
from
me
with
ill
-
grace
,
but
not
without
curiosity
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
he
read
the
lines
,
his
face
changed
and
he
went
paler
.
<EOS>
Raising
his
head
,
he
stood
staring
at
me
open
-
mouthed
in
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
apologize
to
your
Excellency
!
"
<EOS>
he
gasped
,
blanched
to
the
lips
.
<EOS>
"
I
most
humbly
apologize
.
<EOS>
I
--
I
did
not
know
.
<EOS>
You
told
me
nothing
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
kindly
mend
my
passport
,
and
give
it
a
proper
vise
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
he
was
up
from
his
chair
,
and
having
gathered
the
torn
paper
from
the
floor
,
proceeded
to
paste
it
together
.
<EOS>
On
the
back
he
endorsed
that
it
had
been
torn
by
accident
,
and
then
gave
it
the
proper
vise
,
affixing
the
stamps
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
Excellency
,
"
he
said
,
<EOS>
bowing
low
as
he
handed
it
to
me
,
"
I
trust
that
this
affair
will
not
trouble
you
further
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
had
no
intention
of
insulting
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
had
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
insulted
me
merely
because
I
am
English
.
<EOS>
But
recollect
in
future
that
the
man
who
insults
an
Englishman
generally
pays
for
it
,
and
I
do
not
intend
to
let
this
pass
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
higher
power
in
Finland
than
even
the
Governor
-
General
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
Excellency
,
"
whined
the
fellow
who
only
ten
minutes
ago
had
been
such
an
insulting
bully
,
"
I
shall
lose
my
position
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
wife
and
six
children
--
my
wife
is
delicate
,
and
my
pay
here
is
not
a
large
one
.
<EOS>
You
will
forgive
,
wo
n't
you
,
Excellency
?
<EOS>
I
have
apologized
--
I
most
humbly
apologize
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
took
up
the
letter
I
had
given
him
,
holding
it
gingerly
with
trembling
fingers
.
<EOS>
And
well
he
might
,
for
the
document
was
headed
:
 
"
MINISTER
OF
THE
IMPERIAL
HOUSEHOLD
,
PALACE
OF
PETERHOF
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
bearer
of
this
is
one
Gordon
Francis
Gregg

British
subject
,
whom
it
is
Our
will
and
command
that
he
shall
be
Our
guest
during
his
journey
through
our
dominion
.
<EOS>
And
we
hereby
command
all
Governors
of
Provinces
and
minor
officials
to
afford
him
all
the
facilities
he
requires
and
privileges
and
immunities
as
Our
guest
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
above
decree
was
in
a
neat
copper
-
plate
handwriting
in
Russian
,
while
beneath
was
the
sprawling
signature
of
the
ruler
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
millions
of
people
,
that
signature
that
was
all
-
powerful
from
the
gulf
of
Bothnia
to
the
Pacific--"Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
document
was
the
one
furnished
to
me
a
year
before
when
,
at
the
invitation
of
the
Russian
Government
,
I
had
gone
on
a
mission
of
inquiry
into
the
state
of
the
prisons
in
order
to
see
,
on
behalf
of
the
British
public
,
whether
things
were
as
black
as
some
writers
had
painted
them
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
my
intention
to
visit
the
far
-
off
penal
settlements
in
Northern
Siberia
,
but
having
gone
through
some
twenty
prisons
in
European
Russia
,
my
health
had
failed
<EOS>
and
I
had
been
compelled
to
return
to
Italy
to
recuperate
.
<EOS>
The
document
had
therefore
remained
in
my
possession
because
I
intended
to
resume
my
journey
in
the
following
summer
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
order
that
I
should
be
permitted
to
go
where
I
liked
,
and
to
see
what
I
liked
without
official
hindrance
,
that
his
Majesty
the
Emperor
had
,
at
the
instigation
of
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
,
given
me
that
most
valuable
document
.
 
<EOS>
Sight
of
it
had
changed
the
Chief
of
Police
from
a
burly
bully
into
a
whining
coward
,
for
he
saw
that
he
had
torn
up
the
passport
of
a
guest
of
the
Czar
,
and
the
consequence
was
most
serious
if
I
complained
.
<EOS>
He
begged
of
me
to
pardon
him
,
urging
all
manner
of
excuses
,
and
humbling
himself
before
me
as
well
as
before
his
two
inferiors
,
who
now
regarded
me
with
awe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
atone
for
the
insult
in
any
way
your
high
Excellency
desires
,
"
declared
the
official
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
serve
your
Excellency
in
any
way
he
may
command
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
words
suggested
a
brilliant
idea
.
<EOS>
I
had
this
man
in
my
power
;
he
feared
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
after
some
reluctance
,
"
there
is
a
little
matter
in
which
you
might
be
of
some
assistance
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
,
I
will
reconsider
my
decision
of
complaining
to
Petersburg
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
that
,
Excellency
?
"
<EOS>
he
gasped
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
a
young
English
lady
named
Elma
Heath
,
"
I
said
,
and
I
wrote
down
the
name
for
him
upon
a
piece
of
paper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Age
about
twenty
,
and
was
at
school
at
Chichester
,
in
England
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
niece
of
a
certain
Baron
Oberg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Baron
Oberg
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
looking
at
me
rather
strangely
,
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
as
she
is
a
foreigner
she
will
be
registered
in
your
books
.
<EOS>
She
is
somewhere
in
your
province
,
but
where
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
where
she
is
,
and
I
will
say
nothing
more
about
my
passport
,
"
I
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
your
high
Excellency
wishes
to
see
the
young
lady
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
reflectively
,
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
it
being
commanded
by
the
Emperor
that
I
shall
serve
your
Excellency
,
I
will
have
immediate
inquiries
made
,
"
was
his
answer
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
discover
her
whereabouts
,
I
will
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
calling
at
your
Excellency
's
hotel
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
left
the
fellow
,
very
satisfied
that
I
had
turned
his
officiousness
and
hatred
of
the
English
to
very
good
account
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
gray
,
dreary
northern
coast
the
long
winter
was
fast
setting
in
.
<EOS>
Poor
oppressed
Finland
suffers
under
a
hard
climate
with
August
frosts
,
an
eight
months
'
winter
in
the
north
,
and
five
months
of
frost
in
the
south
.
<EOS>
Idling
in
sleepy
Abo
,
where
the
public
buildings
were
so
mean
and
meager
and
the
houses
for
the
most
part
built
of
wood
,
I
saw
on
every
hand
the
disastrous
result
of
the
attempted
Russification
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
The
hand
of
the
oppressor
,
that
official
sent
from
Petersburg
to
crush
and
to
conquer
,
was
upon
the
honest
Finnish
nation
.
<EOS>
The
Russian
bureaucracy
was
trying
to
destroy
its
weaker
but
more
successful
neighbor
,
and
in
order
to
do
so
employed
the
harshest
and
most
unscrupulous
officials
it
could
import
.
 
<EOS>
My
fellow
-
traveler
from
Stockholm
,
who
represented
a
firm
of
paper
-
makers
in
Hamburg
,
and
who
paid
an
annual
visit
to
Abo
and
Helsingfors
,
acted
as
my
guide
around
the
town
,
while
I
awaited
the
information
from
the
humbled
Chief
of
Police
.
<EOS>
My
German
friend
pointed
out
to
me
how
,
since
Russia
placed
her
hand
upon
Finland
,
progress
had
been
arrested
,
and
certainly
plain
evidences
were
on
every
hand
.
<EOS>
There
was
growing
discontent
everywhere
,
for
many
of
the
newspapers
had
recently
been
suppressed
and
the
remainder
were
under
a
severe
censorship
;
agriculture
had
already
decreased
,
and
many
of
the
cotton
-
spinning
and
saw
mills
were
silent
and
deserted
.
<EOS>
The
exploitation
of
those
gigantic
forests
from
which
millions
of
trunks
were
floated
down
to
the
sea
annually
had
now
been
suspended
,
the
great
landowners
were
deserting
the
country
,
and
there
was
silence
and
depression
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Finland
had
been
separated
for
economic
purposes
from
the
more
civilized
countries
,
and
bound
to
the
poverty
-
stricken
,
artificially
isolated
and
oppressed
Russia
.
<EOS>
The
double
-
headed
eagle
was
everywhere
,
and
the
people
sat
silent
and
brooding
beneath
its
black
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
an
uprising
here
before
long
,
"
declared
the
German
confidentially
,
as
we
were
taking
tea
one
day
on
the
wooden
balcony
of
the
hotel
where
the
sea
and
the
low
-
lying
islands
stretched
out
before
us
in
the
pale
yellow
of
the
autumn
sundown
.
<EOS>
"
The
people
will
revolt
,
as
they
did
in
Poland
.
<EOS>
The
Finnish
Government
can
only
appeal
to
the
Czar
through
the
Governor
-
General
,
and
one
can
easily
imagine
that
their
suggestions
never
reach
the
Emperor
.
<EOS>
It
is
said
here
that
the
harsher
and
more
corrupt
the
official
,
the
greater
honor
does
he
receive
from
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
But
trouble
is
brewing
for
Russia
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
A
very
serious
trouble
--
depend
upon
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
looked
upon
the
gray
dismal
scene
,
the
empty
port
,
the
silent
quay
,
the
dark
line
of
gloomy
pine
forest
away
beyond
the
town
,
the
broken
coast
and
the
wide
expanse
of
water
glittering
in
the
northern
sunset
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
The
very
silence
seemed
to
forbode
evil
and
mystery
.
<EOS>
Truly
what
I
saw
of
Finland
impressed
me
even
more
than
what
I
had
witnessed
in
the
far
-
off
eastern
provinces
of
European
Russia
.
 
<EOS>
My
object
,
however
,
was
not
to
inquire
into
the
internal
condition
of
Finland
,
or
of
her
resentment
of
her
powerful
conqueror
.
<EOS>
I
was
there
to
find
that
unfortunate
girl
who
had
written
so
strangely
to
her
old
school
friend
and
whose
portrait
had
,
for
some
hidden
reason
,
been
destroyed
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
the
third
day
after
my
arrival
at
Abo
,
while
sitting
on
the
hotel
veranda
reading
an
old
copy
of
the
Paris
_
Journal
_
,
many
portions
of
which
had
been
"
blacked
out
"
by
the
censor
,
the
Chief
of
Police
,
in
his
dark
green
uniform
,
entered
and
saluted
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Excellency
,
may
I
be
permitted
to
speak
with
you
in
private
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
I
responded
,
rising
and
conducting
him
to
my
bedroom
,
where
I
closed
the
door
,
invited
him
to
a
seat
,
and
myself
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
various
inquiries
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
think
I
have
found
the
lady
your
Excellency
is
seeking
.
<EOS>
My
information
,
however
,
must
be
furnished
to
you
in
strictest
confidence
,
"
he
added
,
"
because
there
are
reasons
why
I
should
withhold
her
whereabouts
from
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
reasons
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
--
the
lady
is
living
in
Finland
in
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
she
is
alive
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
she
was
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
world
she
is
dead
,
"
responded
Michael
Boranski
,
stroking
his
red
beard
.
<EOS>
"
For
that
reason
the
information
I
give
you
must
be
treated
as
confidential
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
she
be
in
hiding
?
<EOS>
She
is
guilty
of
no
offense
--
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
but
did
not
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
this
Baron
Oberg
?
<EOS>
You
tell
me
nothing
of
him
,
"
I
said
with
dissatisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
when
I
know
nothing
,
Excellency
?
"
was
his
response
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
certain
that
the
fellow
was
not
speaking
the
truth
,
for
I
had
noticed
his
surprise
when
I
had
first
uttered
the
mysterious
nobleman
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
have
already
said
,
Excellency
,
I
am
desirous
of
atoning
for
my
insult
,
and
will
serve
you
in
every
manner
I
can
.
<EOS>
For
that
reason
I
had
sought
news
of
the
young
English
lady
--
the
Mademoiselle
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
all
foreigners
registered
in
your
books
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
search
was
surely
not
a
difficult
one
.
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
your
police
methods
in
Russia
too
well
,
"
I
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
the
lady
was
not
registered
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
reason
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
,
Excellency
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
regret
that
much
as
I
desire
,
I
dare
not
appear
to
have
any
connection
with
your
quest
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
direct
you
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
will
give
you
instructions
to
a
second
person
to
take
you
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
she
in
Abo
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
Away
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
If
your
Excellency
will
be
down
at
the
end
of
the
quay
to
-
morrow
at
noon
you
will
find
a
carriage
in
waiting
,
and
the
driver
will
have
full
instructions
how
to
take
you
to
her
and
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
Follow
his
directions
implicitly
,
for
he
is
a
man
I
can
trust
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
not
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
go
at
any
moment
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Chief
of
Police
remained
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
,
then
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
I
could
find
the
man
,
you
might
go
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
is
a
long
way
,
and
you
would
not
return
before
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
roads
are
safe
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
driving
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
official
glanced
at
the
clock
,
and
rising
exclaimed--
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
I
will
send
for
the
man
.
<EOS>
If
we
find
him
,
then
the
carriage
will
be
at
the
same
spot
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
quay
in
two
hours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
noon
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
after
seeing
her
,
you
will
of
course
keep
your
promise
of
secrecy
regarding
our
little
misunderstanding
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
given
my
word
,
"
was
the
response
;
and
the
man
bowed
and
left
,
much
,
I
think
,
to
the
surprise
of
the
hotel
-
proprietor
and
his
staff
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
unusual
thing
for
such
a
high
official
as
the
Chief
of
Police
to
visit
one
of
their
guests
in
person
.
<EOS>
If
he
desired
to
interview
any
of
them
,
he
commanded
them
to
attend
at
his
office
,
or
they
were
escorted
there
by
his
gray
-
coated
agents
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
was
cold
,
with
a
biting
wind
from
the
icy
north
,
when
after
a
hasty
luncheon
I
put
on
my
overcoat
and
strolled
along
the
deserted
quay
where
I
lounged
at
the
further
end
,
watching
the
approach
of
a
great
pontoon
of
pine
logs
that
had
apparently
floated
out
of
one
of
the
rivers
and
was
now
being
navigated
to
the
port
by
four
men
who
seemed
every
moment
in
imminent
danger
of
being
washed
off
the
raft
into
the
sea
as
the
waves
broke
over
and
drenched
them
.
<EOS>
They
had
,
however
,
lashed
themselves
to
their
raft
,
I
saw
,
and
now
slowly
piloted
the
great
floating
platform
towards
the
quay
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
have
waited
half
an
hour
,
when
my
attention
was
suddenly
attracted
by
the
rattle
of
wheels
over
the
stones
,
and
turning
<EOS>
I
saw
an
old
closed
carriage
drawn
by
three
horses
abreast
,
with
bells
upon
the
harness
,
approaching
me
rapidly
.
<EOS>
When
it
drew
up
,
the
driver
,
a
burly
-
looking
,
fair
-
headed
Finn
in
a
huge
sheepskin
overcoat
,
motioned
me
to
enter
,
urging
in
broken
Russian--
 
"
Quickly
,
Excellency!--quickly!--you
must
not
be
seen
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
the
instant
I
was
seated
,
<EOS>
and
before
I
could
close
the
door
,
the
horses
plunged
forward
and
we
were
tearing
at
full
gallop
out
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
For
five
miles
<EOS>
or
so
we
skirted
the
sea
along
a
level
,
well
-
made
road
through
a
barren
wind
-
swept
country
<EOS>
whence
the
meager
harvest
had
already
been
garnered
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
villages
.
<EOS>
All
around
was
a
houseless
land
,
rolling
miles
of
brown
and
green
,
broken
and
checkered
by
bits
of
forest
and
clumps
of
dark
melancholy
pines
.
<EOS>
The
road
ran
ever
and
anon
right
down
to
where
the
cold
,
green
waves
broke
upon
the
rocky
shore
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
weeks
that
coast
would
be
ice
-
bound
and
snow
-
covered
,
and
then
the
silence
of
the
God
-
forsaken
country
would
be
complete
.
 
<EOS>
After
five
miles
or
so
,
the
driver
pulled
up
and
descended
to
readjust
his
harness
,
whereupon
I
got
out
and
asked
him
in
the
best
Russian
I
could
command
:
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
we
going
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
Nystad
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
far
is
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sixty
-
eight
,
"
was
his
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
him
to
imply
kilometres
,
as
being
a
Finn
he
would
not
speak
of
versts
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Chief
of
Police
has
given
you
directions
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
high
Excellency
has
told
me
exactly
what
to
do
,
"
was
the
man
's
answer
,
as
he
took
out
his
huge
wooden
pipe
and
filled
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
wish
to
see
the
young
lady
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
answered
,
"
to
first
see
her
,
and
I
do
not
know
whether
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
make
myself
known
to
her
.
<EOS>
Where
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Beyond
Nystad
,
"
was
his
vague
answer
with
a
wave
of
his
big
fat
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
dark
pine
forest
that
stretched
before
us
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
there
about
an
hour
after
sundown
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
I
re
-
entered
the
stuffy
old
conveyance
that
rocked
and
rolled
as
we
dashed
away
over
the
uneven
forest
road
,
and
sat
wondering
to
what
manner
of
place
I
was
being
conducted
.
 
<EOS>
Elma
Heath
was
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
I
recollected
her
curious
letter
and
remembered
every
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
wished
Hornby
to
know
that
she
had
never
revealed
her
secret
.
<EOS>
What
secret
,
I
wondered
?
 
<EOS>
I
lit
an
abominable
cigar
,
and
tried
to
smoke
,
but
I
was
too
filled
with
anxiety
,
too
bewildered
by
the
maze
of
mystery
in
which
I
now
found
myself
.
<EOS>
Two
hours
later
we
pulled
up
before
a
long
log
-
built
post
-
house
just
beyond
a
small
town
in
a
hollow
that
faced
the
sea
,
and
I
alighted
to
watch
the
steaming
horses
being
replaced
by
a
trio
of
fresh
ones
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
Dadendal
,
I
was
informed
,
and
the
proprietor
of
the
place
,
when
I
entered
and
tossed
off
a
liqueur
-
glass
of
cognac
,
pointed
out
to
me
a
row
of
granite
buildings
fallen
much
to
decay
as
the
ancient
convent
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
resuming
our
journey
,
the
short
day
quickly
drew
to
a
close
,
the
sun
sank
yellow
and
watery
over
the
towering
pines
through
which
we
went
mile
after
mile
,
a
dense
,
interminable
forest
wherein
the
wolves
lurked
in
winter
,
often
rendering
the
road
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
The
temperature
fell
,
and
it
froze
again
.
<EOS>
Through
the
window
in
front
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
big
Finn
driver
throwing
his
arms
across
his
shoulders
to
promote
circulation
,
in
the
same
manner
as
does
the
London
"
cabby
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
night
drew
on
we
changed
horses
again
at
a
small
,
dirty
post
-
house
in
the
forest
,
at
the
edge
of
a
lake
,
and
then
pushed
forward
again
,
although
it
was
already
long
past
the
hour
at
which
he
had
said
we
should
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
Time
passed
slowly
in
the
darkness
,
for
we
had
no
light
,
and
the
horses
seemed
to
find
their
way
by
instinct
.
<EOS>
The
rolling
of
the
lumbering
old
vehicle
after
six
hours
had
rendered
me
sleepy
,
I
think
,
for
I
recollect
closing
my
eyes
and
conjuring
up
that
strange
scene
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
suppose
I
must
have
slept
,
for
I
was
awakened
by
a
light
shining
into
my
face
and
the
driver
shaking
me
by
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
When
I
roused
myself
and
,
naturally
,
inquired
the
reason
,
he
placed
his
finger
mysteriously
upon
my
lips
,
saying
:
 
"
Hush
,
your
high
nobility
,
hush
!
<EOS>
Come
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
make
no
noise
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
discovered
,
it
means
death
for
us
--
death
.
<EOS>
Come
,
give
me
your
hand
.
<EOS>
Slowly
.
<EOS>
Tread
softly
.
<EOS>
See
,
here
is
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
in
first
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
be
heard
upon
the
water
.
<EOS>
So
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
fellow
led
me
,
half
-
dazed
,
down
to
the
bank
of
a
broad
,
dark
river
which
I
could
just
distinguish
--
he
led
me
to
an
unknown
bourne
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XI
 
<EOS>
THE
CASTLE
OF
THE
TERROR
  
<EOS>
The
big
Finn
had
,
I
found
,
tied
up
his
horses
,
and
in
the
heavy
old
boat
he
rowed
me
down
the
swollen
river
which
ran
swift
and
turbulent
around
a
sudden
bend
and
then
seemed
to
open
out
to
a
great
width
.
<EOS>
In
the
starlight
I
could
distinguish
that
it
stretched
gray
and
level
to
a
distance
,
and
that
the
opposite
bank
was
fringed
with
pines
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
we
going
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
my
guide
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
But
he
only
whispered
:
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
Excellency
!
<EOS>
Remain
patient
,
and
you
shall
see
the
young
Englishwoman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
I
sat
in
the
boat
,
while
he
allowed
it
to
drift
with
the
current
,
steering
it
with
the
great
heavy
oars
.
<EOS>
The
river
suddenly
narrowed
again
,
with
high
pines
on
either
bank
,
a
silent
,
lonesome
reach
,
perhaps
indeed
one
of
the
loneliest
spots
in
all
Europe
.
<EOS>
Once
the
dismal
howl
of
a
wolf
sounded
close
to
where
we
passed
,
but
my
guide
made
no
remark
.
 
<EOS>
After
nearly
a
mile
,
the
stream
again
opened
out
into
a
broad
lake
where
,
in
the
distance
,
I
saw
rising
sheer
and
high
from
the
water
,
a
long
square
building
of
three
stories
,
with
a
tall
round
tower
at
one
corner
--
an
old
medieval
castle
it
seemed
to
be
.
<EOS>
From
one
of
the
small
windows
of
the
tower
,
as
we
came
into
view
of
it
,
a
light
was
shining
upon
the
water
,
and
my
guide
seeing
it
,
grunted
in
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
had
undoubtedly
been
placed
there
as
signal
.
 
<EOS>
With
great
caution
he
approached
the
place
,
keeping
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
bank
until
we
came
exactly
opposite
the
flanking
-
tower
.
<EOS>
In
the
lighted
window
I
distinctly
saw
a
dark
figure
of
someone
appear
for
a
moment
,
and
then
my
guide
struck
a
match
and
held
it
in
his
fingers
until
it
was
wholly
consumed
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
instantly
the
light
was
extinguished
,
and
then
,
after
waiting
five
minutes
or
so
,
he
pulled
straight
across
the
lake
to
the
high
,
dark
tower
that
descended
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
as
grim
and
silent
as
any
I
had
ever
seen
,
an
impregnable
stronghold
of
the
days
before
siege
guns
were
invented
,
the
fortress
of
some
feudal
prince
or
count
who
had
probably
held
the
surrounding
country
in
thraldom
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
my
hand
against
the
black
,
slimy
wall
to
prevent
the
boat
bumping
,
and
then
distinguished
just
beyond
me
a
small
wooden
ledge
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
steps
which
led
up
to
a
low
arched
door
.
<EOS>
The
latter
had
opened
noiselessly
,
and
the
dark
figure
of
a
woman
stood
peering
forth
.
 
<EOS>
My
guide
uttered
some
reassuring
word
in
Finnish
in
a
low
half
-
whisper
,
and
then
slowly
pushed
the
boat
along
to
the
ledge
,
saying
:
 
"
Your
high
nobility
may
disembark
.
<EOS>
There
is
at
present
no
danger
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
rose
,
gripped
a
big
rusty
chain
to
steady
myself
,
and
climbed
into
the
narrow
doorway
in
the
ponderous
wall
,
where
I
found
myself
in
the
darkness
beside
the
female
who
had
apparently
been
expecting
our
arrival
and
watching
our
signal
.
 
<EOS>
Without
a
word
she
led
me
through
a
short
passage
,
and
then
,
striking
a
match
,
lit
a
big
old
-
fashioned
lantern
.
<EOS>
As
the
light
fell
upon
her
features
I
saw
they
were
thin
and
hard
,
with
deep
-
set
eyes
and
a
stray
wisp
of
silver
across
her
wrinkled
brow
.
<EOS>
Around
her
head
was
a
kind
of
hood
of
the
same
stuff
as
her
dress
,
a
black
,
coarse
woolen
,
while
around
her
neck
was
a
broad
linen
collar
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
I
recognized
that
she
was
a
member
of
some
religious
order
,
some
minor
order
perhaps
,
with
whose
habit
we
,
in
Italy
,
were
not
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
The
thin
ascetic
countenance
was
that
of
a
woman
of
strong
character
,
and
her
funereal
habit
seemed
much
too
large
for
her
stunted
,
shrunken
figure
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
sister
speaks
French
?
<EOS>
"
I
hazarded
in
that
language
,
knowing
that
in
most
convents
throughout
Europe
French
is
known
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oui
,
m'sieur
,
"
was
her
answer
.
"
<EOS>
And
a
leetle
Engleesh
,
too
--
a
ve
-
ry
leetle
,
"
she
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
why
I
am
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
gratified
that
at
least
one
person
in
that
lonesome
country
could
speak
my
own
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
already
been
told
,
"
was
her
answer
with
a
strong
accent
,
as
we
stood
in
that
small
,
bare
stone
room
,
a
semicircular
chamber
in
the
tower
,
once
perhaps
a
prison
.
"
<EOS>
But
are
you
not
afraid
to
venture
here
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
--
because
no
strangers
are
permitted
here
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
If
your
presence
here
was
discovered
you
would
not
leave
this
place
alive
--
so
I
warn
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
prepared
to
risk
that
,
"
I
said
,
smiling
;
at
the
same
time
my
hand
instinctively
sought
my
hip
-
pocket
to
ascertain
that
my
weapon
was
safe
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
see
Miss
Elma
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
old
nun
nodded
,
fumbling
with
her
lantern
.
<EOS>
I
glanced
at
my
watch
and
found
that
it
was
already
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
that
if
you
are
discovered
here
you
exonerate
me
of
all
blame
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
raising
her
head
and
peering
into
my
face
with
her
keen
gray
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
admitting
you
I
am
betraying
my
trust
,
and
that
I
should
not
have
done
were
it
not
compulsory
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Compulsory
!
<EOS>
How
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
order
of
the
Chief
of
Police
.
<EOS>
Even
here
,
we
can
not
afford
to
offend
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
the
fellow
Boranski
had
really
kept
faith
with
me
,
and
at
his
order
the
closed
door
of
the
convent
had
been
opened
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Russian
officialdom
is
all
-
powerful
in
Finland
nowadays
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
the
lady
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
still
prepared
to
risk
your
liberty
and
life
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
full
of
grim
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Lead
me
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
when
you
see
her
you
will
make
no
effort
to
speak
with
her
?
<EOS>
Promise
me
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Sister
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
asking
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
come
here
from
England
,
nay
,
from
Italy
in
search
of
her
,
to
question
her
regarding
a
strange
mystery
and
to
learn
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Surely
I
may
be
permitted
to
speak
with
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
wish
to
learn
the
truth
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
remarked
the
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
her
lover
--
that
you
merely
wished
to
see
her
once
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
her
lover
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
we
have
never
yet
met
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
in
search
of
the
truth
from
her
own
lips
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
will
never
learn
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
hard
,
changed
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
there
is
a
conspiracy
to
preserve
the
secret
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
intend
to
solve
the
mystery
,
and
for
that
reason
I
have
traveled
here
from
England
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
woman
with
the
lantern
smiled
sadly
,
as
though
amused
by
my
impetuosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
on
Russian
soil
now
,
m'sieur
,
not
English
,
"
she
remarked
in
her
broken
English
.
<EOS>
"
If
your
object
were
known
,
you
would
never
be
spared
to
return
to
your
own
land
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
she
sighed
,
"
you
do
not
know
the
mysteries
and
terrors
of
Finland
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
French
subject
,
born
in
Tours
,
and
brought
to
Helsingfors
when
I
was
fifteen
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
Finland
forty
-
five
years
.
<EOS>
Once
we
were
happy
here
,
but
since
the
Czar
appointed
Baron
Oberg
to
be
Governor
-
General----
"
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
without
finishing
her
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Baron
Oberg
--
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
!
"
<EOS>
I
gasped
.
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
Did
you
not
know
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
dropping
into
French
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
is
four
years
now
that
he
has
held
supreme
power
to
crush
and
Russify
these
poor
Finns
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
this
country
,
once
so
prosperous
,
is
a
blot
upon
the
face
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
His
methods
are
the
worst
and
most
unscrupulous
of
any
employed
by
Russia
.
<EOS>
Before
he
came
here
he
was
the
best
hated
man
in
Petersburg
,
and
that
,
they
say
,
is
why
the
Emperor
sent
him
to
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
is
uncle
of
this
young
lady
,
Elma
Heath
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Uncle
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
told
so
.
<EOS>
His
niece
--
poor
young
lady!--can
that
be
?
<EOS>
Surely
not
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
woman
gave
me
no
reason
;
she
only
exhibited
her
palms
and
sighed
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
have
compassion
upon
the
girl
I
sought
;
her
heart
was
really
softer
than
I
had
believed
it
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
does
this
Baron
live
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
surprised
that
he
should
occupy
so
high
a
place
in
Russian
officialdom
--
the
representative
of
the
Czar
,
with
powers
as
great
as
the
Emperor
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
the
Government
Palace
,
in
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
Elma
Heath
is
here
--
in
this
grim
fortress
!
<EOS>
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
m'sieur
,
how
can
I
tell
?
<EOS>
By
reason
of
family
secrets
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
They
account
for
so
much
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
exactly
my
opinion
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
brought
here
against
her
will
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
probably
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
a
cheerful
place
,
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
We
have
five
months
of
ice
and
snow
,
and
for
four
months
are
practically
cut
off
from
civilization
and
see
no
new
face
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Terrible
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
,
glancing
round
at
those
dark
stone
walls
that
seemed
to
breathe
an
air
of
tragedy
and
mystery
.
<EOS>
The
old
castle
had
,
I
supposed
,
been
turned
into
a
convent
,
as
many
have
been
in
Germany
and
Austria
.
<EOS>
Back
in
feudal
times
it
no
doubt
had
been
a
grand
old
place
.
"
<EOS>
And
have
you
been
here
long
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Seven
years
only
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
leaving
.
<EOS>
Even
I
,
used
as
I
am
to
a
solitary
life
,
can
stand
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
its
cold
silence
and
dreariness
will
drive
me
mad
.
<EOS>
In
winter
the
place
is
like
an
ice
-
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
fact
that
the
Baron
was
ruler
of
Finland
amazed
me
,
<EOS>
for
I
had
half
-
expected
him
to
be
some
clever
adventurer
.
<EOS>
Yet
as
the
events
of
the
past
flashed
through
my
brain
,
I
recollected
that
in
Rannoch
Wood
had
been
found
the
miniature
of
the
Russian
Order
of
Saint
Anne
,
a
distinction
which
,
in
all
probability
,
had
been
conferred
upon
him
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
the
coincidence
,
to
say
the
least
,
was
a
remarkable
one
.
<EOS>
I
questioned
my
companion
further
regarding
the
Baron
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
m'sieur
<EOS>
,
"
she
declared
,
"
they
call
him
'
The
Strangler
of
the
Finns
,
'
It
was
he
who
ordered
the
peasants
of
Kasko
to
be
flogged
until
four
of
them
died
--
and
the
Czar
gave
him
the
Star
of
White
Eagle
for
it
--
he
who
suppressed
half
the
newspapers
and
put
eighteen
editors
in
prison
for
publishing
a
report
of
a
meeting
of
the
Swedes
in
Helsingfors
;
he
who
encourages
corruption
and
bribery
among
the
officials
for
the
furtherance
of
Russian
interests
;
he
who
has
ordered
Russian
to
be
the
official
language
,
who
has
restricted
public
education
,
who
has
overtaxed
and
ground
down
the
people
until
now
the
mine
is
laid
,
and
Finland
is
ready
for
open
revolt
.
<EOS>
The
prisons
are
filled
with
the
innocent
;
women
are
flogged
;
the
poor
are
starving
,
and
'
The
Strangler
,
'
as
they
call
him
,
reports
to
the
Czar
that
Finland
is
submissive
and
is
Russianized
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
had
heard
something
of
this
abominable
state
of
affairs
from
time
to
time
from
the
English
press
,
but
had
never
taken
notice
of
the
name
of
the
oppressor
.
<EOS>
So
the
uncle
of
Elma
Heath
was
"
The
Strangler
of
Finland
,
"
the
man
who
,
in
four
years
,
had
reduced
a
prosperous
country
to
a
state
of
ruin
and
revolt
!
 
<EOS>
"
Can
not
I
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
feeling
that
we
had
remained
too
long
there
.
<EOS>
If
my
presence
in
that
place
was
perilous
the
sooner
I
escaped
from
it
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
come
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
silence
!
<EOS>
Walk
softly
,
"
and
holding
up
the
old
horn
lantern
to
give
me
light
,
she
led
me
out
into
the
low
stone
corridor
again
,
conducting
me
through
a
number
of
intricate
passages
,
all
bare
and
gloomy
<EOS>
,
the
stones
worn
hollow
by
the
feet
of
ages
.
<EOS>
On
we
crept
noiselessly
past
a
number
of
low
arched
doors
studded
with
big
nails
in
the
style
of
generations
ago
,
then
turning
suddenly
at
right
angles
,
I
saw
that
we
were
in
a
kind
of
_
cul
de
sac
,
<EOS>
_
before
the
door
of
which
at
the
end
she
stopped
and
placed
her
finger
upon
her
lips
.
<EOS>
Then
,
motioning
me
to
remain
there
,
she
entered
,
closing
the
door
after
her
,
and
leaving
me
in
the
pitch
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
I
strained
my
ears
,
but
could
hear
no
sound
save
that
of
someone
moving
within
.
<EOS>
No
word
was
uttered
,
or
if
so
,
it
was
whispered
so
low
that
it
did
not
reach
me
.
<EOS>
For
nearly
five
minutes
I
waited
in
impatience
outside
that
closed
door
,
until
again
the
handle
turned
and
my
conductress
beckoned
me
in
silence
within
.
 
<EOS>
I
stepped
into
a
small
,
square
chamber
,
the
floor
of
which
was
carpeted
,
and
where
,
suspended
high
above
,
was
a
lamp
that
shed
but
<EOS>
a
faint
light
over
the
barely
-
furnished
place
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
kind
of
sitting
-
room
,
with
a
plain
deal
table
and
a
couple
of
chairs
,
but
there
was
no
stove
,
and
the
place
looked
chill
and
comfortless
.
<EOS>
Beyond
was
another
smaller
room
into
which
the
old
nun
disappeared
for
a
moment
;
then
she
came
forth
leading
a
strange
wan
little
figure
in
a
gray
gown
,
a
figure
whose
face
was
the
most
perfect
and
most
lovely
<EOS>
I
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
Her
wealth
of
chestnut
hair
fell
disheveled
about
her
shoulders
,
and
as
her
hands
were
clasped
before
her
she
looked
straight
at
me
in
surprise
as
she
was
led
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
walked
but
feebly
,
and
her
countenance
was
deathly
pale
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
,
as
she
came
beneath
the
lamp
,
was
,
I
saw
,
coarse
,
yet
clean
,
and
her
beautiful
,
regular
features
,
which
in
her
photograph
had
held
me
in
such
fascination
,
were
even
more
sweet
and
more
matchless
than
I
had
believed
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
stood
before
her
dumbfounded
in
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
In
silence
she
bowed
gracefully
,
and
then
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
,
apparently
wondering
what
I
,
a
perfect
stranger
,
required
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Elma
Heath
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
at
last
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
introduce
myself
to
you
?
<EOS>
My
name
is
Gordon
Gregg
,
English
by
birth
,
cosmopolitan
by
instinct
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
to
ask
you
a
question
--
a
question
that
concerns
yourself
.
<EOS>
Lydia
Moreton
has
sent
me
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
her
great
brown
eyes
watched
my
lips
and
not
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
Her
own
lips
moved
,
but
she
looked
at
me
with
an
inexpressible
sadness
.
<EOS>
No
sound
escaped
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
rigid
before
her
as
one
turned
to
stone
,
for
in
that
instant
,
in
a
flash
indeed
,
I
realized
the
awful
truth
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
both
deaf
and
dumb
!
 
<EOS>
She
raised
her
clasped
hands
to
me
in
silence
,
yet
with
tears
welling
in
her
splendid
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
that
upon
her
wrists
were
a
pair
of
bright
steel
gyves
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
place
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
of
the
woman
in
the
religious
habit
,
when
I
recovered
from
the
shock
of
the
poor
girl
's
terrible
affliction
.
<EOS>
"
Where
am
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
Castle
of
Kajana
--
the
criminal
lunatic
asylum
of
Finland
,
"
was
her
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
prisoner
,
as
you
see
,
has
lost
both
speech
and
hearing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Deaf
and
dumb
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
looking
at
the
beautiful
original
of
that
destroyed
photograph
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
.
"
<EOS>
But
she
has
surely
not
always
been
so
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
think
not
always
,
"
replied
the
sister
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
said
you
intended
to
question
her
,
and
did
I
not
tell
you
that
to
learn
the
truth
was
impossible
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
she
can
write
responses
to
my
questions
?
<EOS>
"
I
argued
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
was
the
old
woman
's
whispered
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
mind
is
affected
.
<EOS>
She
is
,
unfortunately
,
a
hopeless
lunatic
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
looked
straight
into
those
sad
,
wide
-
open
,
yet
unflinching
brown
eyes
utterly
confounded
.
 
<EOS>
Those
white
wrists
held
in
steel
,
that
pale
face
and
blanched
lips
,
the
inertness
of
her
movements
,
all
told
their
own
tragic
tale
.
<EOS>
And
yet
that
letter
I
had
read
,
dictated
in
secret
most
probably
because
her
hands
were
not
free
,
was
certainly
not
the
outpourings
of
a
madwoman
.
<EOS>
She
had
spoken
of
death
,
it
was
true
,
yet
was
it
not
to
be
supposed
that
she
was
slowly
being
driven
to
suicide
?
<EOS>
She
had
kept
her
secret
,
and
she
wished
the
man
Hornby
--
the
man
who
was
to
marry
Muriel
Leithcourt
--
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
we
stood
was
evidently
an
apartment
set
apart
for
her
use
,
for
beyond
<EOS>
was
the
tiny
bedchamber
;
yet
the
small
,
high
-
up
window
was
closely
barred
,
and
the
cold
bareness
of
the
prison
was
sufficient
indeed
to
cause
anyone
confined
there
to
prefer
death
to
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
Again
I
spoke
to
her
slowly
and
kindly
,
but
there
was
no
response
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
absolutely
dumb
was
only
too
apparent
.
<EOS>
Yet
surely
she
had
not
always
been
so
!
<EOS>
I
had
gone
in
search
of
her
because
the
beauty
of
her
portrait
had
magnetized
me
,
and
I
had
now
found
her
to
be
even
more
lovely
than
her
picture
,
yet
,
alas
!
<EOS>
suffering
from
an
affliction
that
rendered
her
life
a
tragedy
.
<EOS>
The
realization
of
the
terrible
truth
staggered
me
.
<EOS>
Such
a
perfect
face
as
hers
<EOS>
I
had
never
before
set
eyes
upon
,
so
beautiful
,
so
clear
-
cut
,
so
refined
,
so
eminently
the
countenance
of
one
well
-
born
,
and
yet
so
ineffably
sad
,
so
full
of
blank
unutterable
despair
.
 
<EOS>
She
placed
her
clasped
hands
to
her
mouth
and
made
signs
by
shaking
her
head
that
she
could
neither
understand
nor
respond
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
took
my
wallet
from
my
pocket
and
wrote
upon
a
piece
of
paper
in
a
large
hand
the
words
:
"
_
I
come
from
Lydia
Moreton
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
Gordon
Gregg
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
her
eager
gaze
fell
upon
the
words
she
became
instantly
filled
with
excitement
,
and
nodded
quickly
.
<EOS>
Then
holding
her
steel
-
clasped
wrists
towards
me
she
looked
wistfully
at
me
,
as
though
imploring
me
to
release
her
from
the
awful
bondage
in
that
silent
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
woman
who
had
led
me
there
endeavored
to
prevent
it
,
I
handed
her
the
pencil
,
and
placed
the
paper
on
the
table
for
her
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
The
nun
tried
to
snatch
it
up
,
but
I
held
her
arm
gently
and
forcibly
,
saying
in
French
:
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
see
if
she
is
really
insane
.
<EOS>
You
will
at
least
allow
me
this
satisfaction
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
while
we
were
in
altercation
,
Elma
,
with
the
pencil
in
her
fingers
,
tried
to
write
,
but
by
reason
of
her
hands
being
bound
so
closely
was
unable
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
after
several
attempts
,
she
succeeded
in
printing
in
uneven
capitals
the
response
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
You
were
on
the
yacht
.
<EOS>
I
thought
they
killed
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
thin
-
faced
old
woman
saw
her
response
--
a
reply
that
was
surely
rational
enough
--
and
her
brows
contracted
with
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
wrote
,
not
allowing
the
sister
to
get
sight
of
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
In
response
,
she
wrote
painfully
and
laboriously
:
 
"
I
am
condemned
for
a
crime
I
did
not
commit
.
<EOS>
Take
me
from
here
,
or
I
shall
kill
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
poor
girl
,
she
believes
herself
innocent
!
<EOS>
They
all
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
is
she
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
duty
to
inquire
the
history
of
their
crimes
.
<EOS>
When
they
are
ill
I
nurse
them
;
that
is
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
the
commandant
of
this
fortress
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Smirnoff
.
<EOS>
If
he
knew
that
I
had
admitted
you
,
you
would
never
leave
this
place
alive
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
Schusselburg
of
Finland
--
the
place
of
imprisonment
for
those
who
have
conspired
against
the
State
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
prison
of
political
conspirators
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
,
m'sieur
,
yes
!
<EOS>
The
place
in
which
some
of
the
poor
creatures
are
tortured
in
order
to
obtain
confessions
and
information
with
as
much
cruelty
as
in
the
black
days
of
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
These
walls
are
thick
,
and
their
cries
are
not
heard
from
the
oubliettes
below
the
lake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
had
long
ago
heard
of
the
horrors
of
Schusselburg
.
<EOS>
Indeed
who
has
not
heard
of
them
who
has
traveled
in
Russia
?
<EOS>
The
very
mention
of
the
modern
Bastille
on
Lake
Ladoga
,
where
no
prisoner
has
ever
been
known
to
come
forth
alive
,
is
sufficient
to
cause
any
Russian
to
turn
pale
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
in
the
Schusselburg
of
Finland
!
 
<EOS>
I
turned
over
the
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
the
question--
 
<EOS>
"
Did
Baron
Oberg
send
you
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
In
response
,
she
printed
the
words--
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
I
was
arrested
in
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
Tell
Lydia
where
I
am
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
Muriel
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
by
the
same
means
,
whereupon
she
replied
that
they
were
at
school
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
me
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
?
<EOS>
"
I
wrote
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
warn
you
,
although
I
had
overheard
their
intentions
.
<EOS>
They
took
me
ashore
when
you
had
gone
,
to
Siena
.
<EOS>
After
three
days
I
found
myself
deaf
and
dumb
--
I
was
made
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Her
allegation
startled
me
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
purposely
afflicted
!
 
<EOS>
"
Who
did
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
doctor
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
They
put
me
under
chloroform
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
People
who
said
they
were
my
friends
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
turned
to
the
woman
in
the
religious
habit
,
and
cried--
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
what
she

<EOS>
She
has
been
maimed
by
some
friends
who
intended
that
the
secret
she
holds
should
be
kept
.
<EOS>
They
feared
to
kill
her
,
so
they
bribed
a
doctor
to
deliberately
operate
upon
her
so
that
she
could
neither
speak
nor
hear
.
<EOS>
And
now
they
are
driving
her
to
suicide
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
M'sieur
,
I
am
astounded
!
"
declared
the
nun
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
believed
that
she
was
not
in
her
right
mind
,
yet
assuredly
she
seems
to
be
as
sane
as
I
am
,
only
willfully
mutilated
by
some
pretended
friend
who
determined
that
no
further
word
should
pass
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
shameful
mutilation
has
been
committed
upon
this
poor
defenseless
girl
!
"
I
cried
in
anger
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
will
make
it
my
duty
to
discover
and
punish
the
perpetrators
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
Do
not
act
rashly
,
I
pray
of
you
,
"
the
woman
said
seriously
,
placing
her
hand
upon
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Recollect
<EOS>
you
are
in
Finland
--
where
the
Baron
Oberg
is
all
-
powerful
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
fear
the
Baron
Oberg
,
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
If
necessary
,
I
will
appeal
to
the
Czar
himself
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
is
kept
here
for
the
reason
that
she
is
in
possession
of
some
secret
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
released
--
I
will
take
the
responsibility
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
not
try
to
release
her
from
here
.
<EOS>
It
would
mean
death
to
you
both
.
<EOS>
The
Castle
of
Kajana
tells
no
secrets
of
those
who
die
within
its
walls
,
or
of
those
cast
headlong
into
its
waters
and
forgotten
.
"
 
<EOS>
Again
I
turned
to
Elma
,
who
stood
in
anxious
wonder
of
the
subject
of
our
conversation
,
and
had
suddenly
taken
the
old
nun
's
hand
and
kissed
it
affectionately
,
perhaps
in
order
to
show
me
that
she
trusted
her
.
 
<EOS>
Then
upon
the
paper
<EOS>
I
wrote--
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
Baron
Oberg
your
uncle
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
in
the
negative
,
showing
that
the
dreaded
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
had
only
acted
a
part
towards
her
in
which
she
had
been
compelled
to
concur
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Philip
Hornby
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
writing
rapidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
--
at
least
,
I
believe
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
Friend
!
<EOS>
And
I
had
all
along
believed
him
to
be
an
adventurer
and
an
enemy
!
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
he
go
to
Leghorn
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
a
secret
purpose
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
plot
to
kill
you
,
only
I
managed
to
thwart
them
,
"
were
the
words
she
printed
with
much
labor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
owe
my
life
to
you
,
"
I
wrote
.
<EOS>
"
And
in
return
I
will
do
my
utmost
to
rescue
you
from
here
,
if
you
do
not
fear
to
place
yourself
in
my
hands
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
to
this
she
replied--
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
thankful
,
for
I
can
not
bear
this
awful
place
longer
.
<EOS>
I
believe
they
must
torture
the
women
here
.
<EOS>
They
will
torture
me
some
day
.
<EOS>
Do
your
best
to
get
me
out
of
here
<EOS>
and
I
will
tell
you
everything
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
she
wrote
,
"
I
fear
you
can
never
secure
my
release
.
<EOS>
I
am
confined
here
on
a
life
sentence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
English
,
and
if
you
have
had
no
trial
I
can
complain
to
our
Ambassador
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
a
Russian
subject
.
<EOS>
I
was
born
in
Russia
,
and
went
to
England
when
I
was
a
girl
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
altered
the
case
entirely
.
<EOS>
As
a
subject
of
the
Czar
in
her
own
country
she
was
amenable
to
that
disgraceful
blot
upon
civilization
that
allows
a
person
to
be
consigned
to
prison
at
the
will
of
a
high
official
,
without
trial
or
without
being
afforded
any
opportunity
of
appeal
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
at
once
saw
a
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
she
promised
to
tell
me
the
truth
if
I
could
but
secure
her
release
!
 
<EOS>
A
flood
of
recollections
of
the
amazing
mystery
swept
through
my
mind
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
questions
arose
within
me
,
all
of
which
I
desired
to
ask
her
,
but
there
,
in
that
noisome
prison
-
house
,
it
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
As
I
stood
there
a
woman
's
shrill
scream
of
excruciating
pain
reached
me
,
notwithstanding
those
cyclopean
walls
.
<EOS>
Some
unfortunate
prisoner
was
,
perhaps
,
being
tortured
and
confession
wrung
from
her
lips
.
<EOS>
I
shuddered
at
the
unspeakable
horrors
of
that
grim
fortress
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
allow
this
refined
defenseless
girl
to
remain
an
inmate
of
that
Bastille
,
the
terrors
of
which
I
had
heard
men
in
Russia
hint
at
with
bated
breath
?
<EOS>
They
had
willfully
maimed
her
and
deprived
her
of
both
hearing
and
the
power
of
speech
,
and
now
they
intended
that
she
should
be
driven
mad
by
that
silence
and
loneliness
that
must
always
end
in
insanity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
decided
,
"
I
said
suddenly
,
turning
to
the
woman
who
had
conducted
me
there
,
and
having
now
removed
the
steel
bonds
of
the
prisoner
with
a
key
she
secretly
carried
,
stood
with
folded
hands
in
the
calm
attitude
of
the
religious
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
act
with
rashness
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
implored
in
quick
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
your
life
is
at
stake
,
as
well
as
my
own
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
enemies
intended
that
I
,
too
,
should
die
!
"
<EOS>
I
answered
,
looking
straight
into
those
deep
mysterious
brown
eyes
which
held
me
as
beneath
a
spell
.
"
<EOS>
They
have
drawn
her
into
their
power
because
she
had
no
means
of
defense
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
assume
the
position
of
her
friend
and
protector
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
man
is
awaiting
me
in
the
boat
outside
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
take
her
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
m'sieur
,
why
that
is
impossible
!
"
cried
the
old
woman
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
discovered
by
the
guards
who
patrol
the
lake
both
night
and
day
they
would
shoot
you
both
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
risk
it
,
"
I
said
,
and
without
another
word
dashed
into
the
tiny
bed
chamber
and
tore
an
old
brown
blanket
from
off
the
narrow
truckle
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
linking
my
arm
in
that
of
the
woman
whose
lovely
countenance
had
verily
become
the
sun
of
my
existence
,
I
made
a
sign
,
inviting
her
to
accompany
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
sister
barred
the
door
,
urging
me
to
reconsider
my
decision
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
her
alone
in
secret
,
and
act
as
you
will
,
appeal
to
the
Baron
,
to
the
Czar
,
but
do
not
attempt
,
m'sieur
,
to
rescue
a
prisoner
from
here
,
for
it
is
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
brought
you
here
from
Abo
will
not
dare
to
accept
such
responsibility
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
to
Elma
,
although
,
alas
!
<EOS>
she
could
not
hear
my
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
at
least
make
a
dash
for
freedom
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
recognized
my
intentions
in
a
moment
,
and
allowed
herself
to
be
conducted
down
the
long
intricate
corridor
,
walking
stealthily
,
and
making
no
noise
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
seized
the
old
horn
lantern
,
and
as
the
nun
held
back
,
not
daring
to
accompany
us
,
we
stole
on
alone
,
turning
back
along
the
stone
corridor
until
I
recognized
the
door
of
the
room
to
which
I
had
been
first
conducted
.
<EOS>
All
was
silent
,
and
as
we
crept
along
on
tiptoe
<EOS>
I
felt
the
girl
's
grip
upon
my
arm
,
a
grip
that
told
me
that
she
placed
her
faith
in
me
as
her
deliverer
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
that
it
was
a
rash
and
headstrong
act
,
for
even
beyond
the
lake
<EOS>
how
could
we
ever
hope
to
penetrate
those
interminable
inhospitable
forests
,
so
far
from
any
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
felt
it
my
duty
to
attempt
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
had
not
her
marvelous
beauty
enmeshed
me
;
had
I
not
felt
by
some
unaccountable
intuition
at
the
first
moment
we
had
met
that
our
lives
were
linked
in
the
future
?
<EOS>
She
clung
to
me
as
though
fearful
of
discovery
,
as
we
went
forward
in
silence
along
that
dark
,
low
corridor
where
I
knew
the
strong
door
in
the
tower
opened
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
Once
in
the
boat
,
and
we
could
row
back
to
where
the
horses
awaited
us
,
and
then
away
.
<EOS>
The
woman
had
not
arrested
our
progress
or
raised
an
alarm
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
Once
I
had
mistrusted
her
,
but
I
now
saw
that
her
heart
was
really
filled
with
pity
for
the
poor
girl
now
at
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
Without
a
sound
we
crept
forward
until
within
a
few
yards
from
that
unlocked
door
where
the
boat
awaited
us
below
,
when
,
of
a
sudden
,
the
uncertain
light
of
the
lantern
fell
upon
something
that
shone
and
a
deep
voice
cried
out
of
the
darkness
in
Russian--
 
<EOS>
"
Halt
!
<EOS>
or
I
fire
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
startled
,
we
found
ourselves
looking
down
the
muzzle
of
a
loaded
carbine
.
 
<EOS>
A
huge
sentry
stood
with
his
back
to
the
secret
exit
,
his
dark
eyes
shining
beneath
his
peaked
cap
,
as
he
held
his
weapon
to
his
shoulder
within
six
feet
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
big
,
bearded
fellow
demanded
fiercely
who
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
sank
within
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
acted
recklessly
,
and
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
his
Excellency
,
the
Baron
Xavier
Oberg
,
the
unscrupulous
Governor
-
General
--
fallen
into
a
trap
which
,
it
seemed
,
had
been
very
cleverly
prepared
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
prisoner
in
the
terrible
fortress
whence
no
single
person
save
the
guards
had
ever
been
known
to
emerge
--
the
Bastille
of
"
The
Strangler
of
Finland
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
saw
I
was
lost
.
 
<EOS>
The
muzzle
of
the
sentry
's
carbine
was
within
two
feet
of
my
chest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
!
"
cried
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
At
a
glance
I
took
in
the
peril
of
the
situation
,
and
without
a
second
's
hesitation
made
a
dive
for
the
man
beneath
his
weapon
.
<EOS>
He
lowered
it
,
but
it
was
too
late
,
for
I
gripped
him
around
the
waist
,
rendering
his
gun
useless
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
work
of
an
instant
,
for
I
knew
that
to
close
with
him
was
my
only
chance
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
if
the
boat
was
not
in
waiting
below
that
closed
door
?
<EOS>
If
my
Finn
driver
was
not
there
in
readiness
,
then
I
was
lost
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
girl
whom
I
was
there
to
rescue
drew
back
in
fright
against
the
wall
for
a
single
second
,
then
,
seeing
that
I
had
closed
with
the
hulking
fellow
<EOS>
,
she
sprang
forward
,
and
with
both
hands
seized
the
gun
and
attempted
to
wrest
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
His
fingers
had
lost
the
trigger
,
and
he
was
trying
to
regain
it
to
fire
and
so
raise
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
I
saw
this
,
and
with
an
old
trick
learned
at
Uppingham
I
tripped
him
,
so
that
he
staggered
and
nearly
fell
.
 
<EOS>
An
oath
escaped
him
,
yet
in
that
moment
Elma
succeeded
in
twisting
the
gun
from
his
sinewy
hands
,
which
I
now
held
with
a
strength
begotten
of
a
knowledge
of
my
imminent
peril
.
<EOS>
My
whole
future
,
as
well
as
hers
,
depended
upon
my
success
in
that
desperate
encounter
.
<EOS>
He
was
huge
and
powerful
,
with
a
strength
far
exceeding
my
own
,
yet
I
had
been
reckoned
a
good
wrestler
at
Uppingham
,
and
now
my
knowledge
of
that
most
ancient
form
of
combat
held
me
in
good
stead
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
shouted
for
help
,
his
deep
,
hoarse
voice
sounding
along
the
stone
corridors
.
<EOS>
If
heard
by
his
comrades
-
in
-
arms
,
then
the
alarm
would
at
once
be
given
.
 
<EOS>
We
struggled
desperately
,
swaying
to
and
fro
,
he
trying
to
throw
me
,
while
I
,
at
every
turn
,
practiced
upon
him
the
tricks
learned
in
my
youth
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
an
even
match
,
however
,
for
he
kept
his
feet
by
sheer
brute
force
,
and
his
muscles
seemed
hard
and
unbending
as
steel
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
as
we
were
striving
so
vigorously
and
desperately
,
the
English
girl
slipped
past
us
with
the
carbine
in
her
hand
,
and
with
a
quick
movement
dragged
open
the
heavy
door
that
gave
exit
to
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
instant
I
unfortunately
made
a
false
move
,
and
his
hand
closed
upon
my
throat
like
a
band
of
steel
.
<EOS>
I
fought
and
struggled
to
loose
myself
,
exerting
every
muscle
,
but
alas
!
<EOS>
he
gained
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
splash
,
and
saw
that
Elma
no
longer
held
the
sentry
's
weapon
in
her
hands
,
having
thrown
it
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
Then
at
the
same
moment
I
heard
a
voice
outside
cry
in
a
low
tone
:
"
Courage
,
Excellency
!
<EOS>
Courage
!
<EOS>
I
will
come
and
help
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
faithful
Finn
,
who
had
been
awaiting
me
in
the
deep
shadow
,
and
with
a
few
strokes
pulled
his
boat
up
to
the
narrow
rickety
ledge
outside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
the
lady
!
"
<EOS>
I
succeeded
in
gasping
in
Russian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
mind
me
,
"
and
I
saw
to
my
satisfaction
that
he
guided
Elma
to
step
into
the
boat
,
which
at
that
moment
drifted
past
the
little
platform
.
 
<EOS>
I
struggled
valiantly
,
but
against
such
a
man
of
brute
strength
I
was
powerless
.
<EOS>
He
held
my
throat
,
causing
me
excruciating
pain
,
and
each
moment
I
felt
my
chance
of
victory
grow
smaller
.
<EOS>
My
strength
was
failing
.
<EOS>
While
I
held
his
arms
at
his
sides
,
I
could
keep
him
secure
without
much
effort
,
but
now
with
his
fingers
pressing
in
my
windpipe
I
could
not
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
slowly
being
strangled
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
vanquished
meant
imprisonment
there
,
perhaps
even
death
.
<EOS>
Victory
meant
Elma
's
life
,
as
well
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
Mine
was
therefore
a
fight
for
life
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
idea
flashed
across
my
mind
,
and
I
continued
to
struggle
,
at
the
same
time
gradually
forcing
my
enemy
backward
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
shouted
for
help
,
but
was
unheard
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
and
swore
and
shouted
until
,
<EOS>
with
a
sudden
and
almost
superhuman
effort
,
I
tripped
him
,
bringing
his
head
into
such
violent
contact
with
the
stone
lintel
of
the
door
that
the
sound
could
surely
be
heard
a
considerable
distance
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
was
stunned
,
and
in
that
brief
second
I
released
his
grip
from
my
throat
and
hurled
him
backwards
beyond
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
sound
of
the
crashing
of
wood
as
the
rotten
platform
gave
way
,
a
loud
splash
,
and
next
instant
<EOS>
the
dark
waters
closed
over
the
big
,
bearded
fellow
who
would
have
snatched
Elma
Heath
from
me
,
and
have
held
me
prisoner
in
that
castle
of
terrors
.
<EOS>
He
sank
like
a
stone
,
for
although
I
stood
watching
for
him
to
rise
,
I
could
only
distinguish
the
woodwork
floating
away
with
the
current
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
moment
,
however
,
even
as
I
stood
there
in
horror
at
my
deed
of
self
-
defense
,
the
place
suddenly
resounded
with
shouts
of
alarm
,
and
in
the
tower
above
me
the
great
old
rusty
bell
began
to
swing
,
ringing
its
brazen
note
across
the
broad
expanse
of
waters
.
 
<EOS>
The
fair
-
bearded
Finn
again
shot
the
boat
across
to
where
I
stood
,
crying--
 
<EOS>
"
Jump
,
Excellency
!
<EOS>
For
your
life
,
jump
!
<EOS>
The
guards
will
be
upon
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
Behind
me
in
the
passage
<EOS>
I
saw
a
light
and
the
glitter
of
arms
.
<EOS>
A
shot
rang
out
,
and
a
bullet
whizzed
past
me
,
but
I
stood
unharmed
.
<EOS>
Then
I
jumped
,
and
nearly
upset
the
boat
,
but
taking
an
oar
I
began
to
row
for
life
,
and
as
we
drew
away
from
those
grim
,
black
walls
the
fire
belched
forth
from
three
rifles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Row
!
<EOS>
"
I
shrieked
,
turning
to
see
if
my
fair
companion
had
been
hit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
cool
,
Excellency
,
"
urged
the
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
See
,
right
away
there
in
the
shadow
.
<EOS>
We
might
trick
them
,
for
the
patrol
-
boat
will
be
at
the
head
of
the
river
waiting
to
cut
us
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
Again
the
guards
fired
upon
us
,
but
in
the
darkness
their
aim
was
faulty
.
<EOS>
Lights
appeared
in
the
high
windows
of
the
castle
,
and
we
could
see
that
the
greatest
commotion
had
been
caused
by
the
escape
of
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
men
at
the
door
in
the
tower
were
shouting
to
the
patrol
-
boats
,
which
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
,
calling
them
to
row
us
down
and
capture
us
,
but
by
plying
our
oars
rapidly
we
shot
straight
across
the
lake
until
we
got
under
the
deep
shadow
of
the
opposite
shore
,
and
then
crept
gradually
along
in
the
direction
we
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
we
meet
the
boats
,
Excellency
,
we
must
run
ashore
and
take
to
the
woods
,
"
explained
the
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
our
only
chance
.
"
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
he
spoken
when
out
in
the
center
of
the
lake
we
could
just
distinguish
a
long
boat
with
three
rowers
going
swiftly
towards
the
entrance
to
the
river
,
which
we
so
desired
to
gain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
!
"
<EOS>
cried
our
guide
,
backing
water
,
and
bringing
the
boat
to
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
in
search
of
us
!
<EOS>
If
we
are
discovered
they
will
fire
.
<EOS>
It
is
their
orders
.
<EOS>
No
boat
is
allowed
upon
this
lake
.
"
 
<EOS>
Elma
sat
watching
our
pursuers
,
but
still
calm
and
silent
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
intrust
herself
entirely
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
guards
were
rowing
rapidly
,
the
oars
sounding
in
the
rowlocks
,
evidently
in
the
belief
that
we
had
made
for
the
river
.
<EOS>
But
the
Finlander
had
apparently
foreseen
this
,
and
for
that
reason
we
were
lying
safe
from
observation
in
the
deep
shadow
of
an
overhanging
tree
.
 
<EOS>
A
gray
mist
was
slowly
rising
from
the
water
,
and
the
Finn
,
noticing
it
<EOS>
,
hoped
that
it
might
favor
us
.
<EOS>
In
Finland
in
late
autumn
the
mists
are
often
as
thick
as
our
proverbial
London
fogs
,
only
whiter
,
denser
,
and
more
frosty
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
we
disembark
we
shall
be
compelled
to
make
a
detour
of
fully
four
days
in
the
forest
,
in
order
to
pass
the
marshes
,
"
he
pointed
out
in
a
low
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
But
if
we
can
enter
the
river
we
can
go
ashore
anywhere
and
get
by
foot
to
some
place
where
the
lady
can
lie
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
advise
?
<EOS>
We
are
entirely
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
The
Chief
of
Police
told
me
he
could
trust
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
will
be
best
to
risk
it
,
"
he
said
in
Russian
after
a
brief
pause
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
tie
up
the
boat
,
and
I
will
go
along
the
bank
and
see
what
the
guards
are
doing
.
<EOS>
You
will
remain
here
,
and
I
shall
not
be
seen
.
<EOS>
The
rushes
and
undergrowth
are
higher
further
along
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
is
danger
while
I
am
absent
get
out
and
go
straight
westward
until
you
find
the
marsh
,
then
keep
along
its
banks
due
south
,
"
and
drawing
up
the
boat
to
the
bank
the
shrewd
,
big
-
boned
fellow
disappeared
into
the
dark
undergrowth
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
no
signs
yet
of
the
break
of
day
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
stars
were
now
hidden
,
and
the
great
plane
of
water
was
every
moment
growing
more
indistinct
as
we
both
sat
in
silence
.
<EOS>
My
ears
were
strained
to
catch
the
dipping
of
an
oar
or
a
voice
,
but
beyond
the
lapping
of
the
water
beneath
the
boat
there
was
no
other
sound
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
hand
of
the
fair
-
faced
girl
at
my
side
and
pressed
it
.
<EOS>
In
return
she
pressed
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
means
by
which
we
could
exchange
confidences
.
<EOS>
She
whom
I
had
sought
through
all
those
months
sat
at
my
side
,
yet
powerless
to
utter
one
single
word
.
 
<EOS>
Still
holding
her
hands
in
both
my
own
I
gripped
them
to
show
her
that
I
intended
to
be
her
champion
,
while
she
turned
to
me
in
confidence
as
though
happy
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
What
,
I
wondered
,
was
her
history
?
<EOS>
What
was
the
mystery
surrounding
her
?
<EOS>
What
could
be
that
secret
which
had
caused
her
enemies
to
thus
brutally
maim
and
mutilate
her
,
and
afterwards
send
her
to
that
grim
,
terrible
fortress
that
still
loomed
up
before
us
in
the
gloom
?
<EOS>
Surely
her
secret
must
affect
some
person
very
seriously
,
or
such
drastic
means
would
never
be
employed
to
secure
her
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
I
heard
a
stealthy
footstep
approaching
,
and
next
moment
a
low
voice
spoke
which
I
recognized
as
that
of
our
friend
,
the
Finn
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
danger
,
Excellency
--
a
grave
danger
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
in
a
low
half
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
Three
boats
are
in
search
of
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
scarcely
had
he
uttered
those
words
when
there
was
the
flash
of
a
rifle
from
the
haze
,
a
loud
report
,
and
again
a
bullet
whizzed
past
just
behind
my
head
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
truth
became
apparent
,
for
I
saw
the
dark
shadow
of
a
boat
rapidly
rowed
,
bearing
full
upon
us
.
<EOS>
The
shot
had
been
fired
as
a
signal
that
we
had
been
sighted
,
and
were
pursued
.
<EOS>
Other
shots
rang
out
,
mingled
with
the
wild
exultant
shouts
of
the
guards
as
they
bore
down
full
upon
us
,
and
then
I
knew
that
,
notwithstanding
our
escape
,
we
were
now
lost
.
<EOS>
They
were
too
close
upon
us
to
admit
of
eluding
them
.
<EOS>
The
peril
we
had
dreaded
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
The
Finn
's
presence
on
the
bank
had
evidently
been
detected
by
a
boat
drawn
up
at
the
shore
,
and
he
had
been
followed
to
where
we
had
lain
in
what
we
had
so
foolishly
believed
to
be
a
safe
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
Nought
else
was
to
be
done
but
to
face
the
inevitable
.
<EOS>
Three
times
the
red
fire
of
a
rifle
belched
angrily
in
our
faces
,
and
yet
,
by
good
fortune
,
neither
of
us
was
struck
.
<EOS>
Yet
we
knew
too
well
that
the
intention
of
our
pursuers
was
to
kill
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quick
,
Excellency
!
<EOS>
Fly
!
<EOS>
while
there
is
yet
time
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
the
Finn
,
grasping
my
hand
and
half
dragging
me
from
the
boat
,
while
,
I
,
in
turn
,
placed
Elma
upon
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Hoida
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
This
way
!
<EOS>
Swiftly
!
"
cried
our
guide
,
and
the
three
of
us
,
heedless
of
the
consequences
,
plunged
forward
into
the
impenetrable
darkness
,
just
as
our
fierce
pursuers
came
alongside
where
we
had
only
a
moment
ago
been
seated
.
<EOS>
They
shouted
wildly
as
they
sprang
to
land
after
us
,
but
our
guide
,
who
had
been
born
and
bred
in
these
forests
,
knew
well
how
to
travel
in
a
semi
-
circle
,
and
how
to
conceal
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
race
for
freedom
--
nay
,
for
very
life
.
 
<EOS>
So
dark
that
we
could
see
before
us
hardly
a
foot
,
we
were
compelled
to
place
our
hands
in
front
of
us
to
avoid
collision
with
the
big
tree
trunks
,
while
ever
and
anon
<EOS>
we
found
ourselves
entangled
in
the
mass
of
dead
creepers
and
vegetable
parasites
that
formed
the
dense
undergrowth
.
<EOS>
Around
us
on
every
side
we
heard
the
shouts
and
curses
of
our
pursuers
,
while
above
the
rest
we
heard
an
authoritative
voice
,
evidently
that
of
a
sergeant
of
the
guard
,
cry--
 
<EOS>
"
Shoot
the
man
,
but
spare
the
woman
!
<EOS>
The
Colonel
wants
her
back
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
her
escape
!
<EOS>
We
shall
be
well
rewarded
.
<EOS>
So
keep
on
,
comrades
!
<EOS>
_
Mene
edemmaeski
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
trembling
girl
beside
me
heard
nothing
,
and
perhaps
indeed
it
was
best
that
she
could
not
hear
.
<EOS>
My
only
fear
was
that
our
pursuers
,
of
whom
there
now
seemed
to
be
a
dozen
,
had
extended
,
with
the
intention
of
encircling
us
.
<EOS>
They
,
no
doubt
,
knew
every
inch
of
that
giant
forest
with
its
numerous
bogs
and
marshes
,
and
if
they
could
not
discover
us
would
no
doubt
drive
us
into
one
or
other
of
the
bogs
,
where
escape
was
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
Our
gallant
guide
,
on
the
other
hand
,
seemed
to
utterly
disregard
the
danger
and
kept
on
,
every
now
and
then
stretching
out
his
hand
and
helping
along
the
afflicted
girl
we
had
rescued
from
that
living
tomb
.
<EOS>
Headlong
we
went
in
a
straight
line
,
until
suddenly
we
began
to
feel
our
feet
sinking
into
the
soft
ground
,
and
then
the
Finlander
turned
to
the
left
,
at
right
angles
,
and
we
found
ourselves
in
a
denser
undergrowth
,
where
in
the
darkness
our
hands
and
faces
became
badly
scratched
.
 
<EOS>
Another
gun
was
fired
as
signal
,
echoing
through
the
wood
,
but
the
sound
came
from
the
opposite
direction
to
that
we
were
traveling
;
therefore
we
hoped
that
we
had
eluded
those
whose
earnest
desire
it
was
to
capture
us
for
the
reward
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
a
second
gun
,
an
answering
signal
,
was
fired
from
straight
before
us
,
and
that
revealed
the
truth
.
<EOS>
We
were
actually
between
the
two
parties
,
and
they
were
closing
in
upon
us
!
<EOS>
They
had
already
driven
us
to
the
edge
of
the
bog
.
<EOS>
The
Finlander
recognized
our
peril
as
quickly
as
I
did
,
and
halted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
turn
straight
back
,
"
he
urged
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
yet
elude
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
we
again
turned
off
at
right
angles
,
traveling
as
quickly
as
we
were
able
back
towards
the
lake
shore
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
exciting
chase
in
the
darkness
,
for
we
knew
not
whither
we
were
going
,
nor
into
what
pitfall
or
ravine
or
treacherous
marsh
we
might
fall
.
<EOS>
Once
we
saw
afar
through
the
trees
the
light
of
a
lantern
held
by
a
guard
,
and
already
the
sweet
-
faced
girl
beside
me
seemed
tired
and
terribly
fatigued
.
<EOS>
But
we
hurried
on
and
on
,
striving
to
make
no
noise
,
and
yet
the
crackling
of
wood
beneath
our
feet
seemed
to
us
to
sound
like
the
noise
of
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
breathless
,
we
halted
to
listen
.
<EOS>
We
were
already
in
sight
of
the
gray
mist
where
lay
the
silent
lake
that
held
so
many
secrets
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
sound
.
<EOS>
The
guards
had
gone
straight
on
,
believing
they
had
driven
us
into
that
deadly
bog
wherein
,
if
we
had
entered
,
we
must
have
been
slowly
sucked
down
and
engulfed
.
<EOS>
They
were
surrounding
it
,
no
doubt
,
feeling
certain
of
their
prey
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
crept
along
the
water
's
edge
,
until
in
the
gray
light
we
could
distinguish
two
empty
boats
--
that
of
the
guards
and
our
own
.
<EOS>
We
were
again
at
the
spot
where
we
had
disembarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
row
to
the
head
of
the
lake
,
"
suggested
the
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
then
land
and
escape
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
a
moment
later
we
were
all
three
in
the
guards
'
boat
,
rowing
with
all
our
might
under
the
deep
shadow
of
the
bank
northward
,
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
town
of
Nystad
.
 
<EOS>
We
kept
a
sharp
look
-
out
for
any
other
boat
,
but
saw
none
.
<EOS>
The
signals
ashore
had
attracted
all
the
guards
to
that
spot
to
join
in
the
search
,
and
now
,
having
doubled
back
and
again
embarked
,
we
were
every
moment
increasing
the
distance
between
ourselves
and
our
pursuers
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
must
have
rowed
several
miles
,
for
ere
we
landed
again
,
upon
a
low
,
flat
and
barren
shore
,
the
first
gray
streak
of
day
was
showing
in
the
east
.
 
<EOS>
Elma
noticed
it
,
and
kept
her
great
brown
eyes
fixed
upon
it
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
dawn
for
her
--
the
dawn
of
a
new
life
.
<EOS>
Our
eyes
met
;
she
smiled
at
me
,
and
then
gazed
again
eastward
,
full
of
silent
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
Having
landed
,
we
drew
the
boat
up
and
concealed
it
in
the
undergrowth
so
that
the
guards
,
on
searching
,
should
not
know
the
direction
we
had
taken
,
and
then
we
went
straight
on
northward
across
the
low
-
lying
lands
,
to
where
the
forest
showed
dark
against
the
morning
gray
.
<EOS>
The
mist
had
now
somewhat
cleared
,
but
the
air
was
keen
and
frosty
.
 
<EOS>
This
wood
,
we
found
,
was
of
tall
high
pines
,
where
walking
was
not
difficult
,
a
wide
wilderness
of
trees
which
,
hour
after
hour
,
we
traversed
in
the
vain
endeavor
to
find
the
rough
path
which
our
guide
told
us
led
for
a
hundred
miles
from
Alavo
down
to
Tammerfors
,
the
manufacturing
center
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
But
to
discover
a
path
in
a
forest
forty
miles
wide
is
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
,
and
for
hours
we
wandered
on
and
on
,
but
alas
!
<EOS>
always
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
Faint
and
hungry
,
yet
we
still
kept
courage
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
we
found
a
little
spring
,
and
all
three
of
us
drank
eagerly
with
our
hands
.
<EOS>
But
of
food
we
had
nothing
,
save
a
small
piece
of
hard
rye
bread
which
the
Finn
had
in
his
pocket
,
the
remains
of
his
evening
meal
;
and
this
we
gave
to
Elma
,
who
,
half
famished
,
ate
it
quickly
.
<EOS>
We
knew
quite
well
that
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
die
of
starvation
in
that
great
trackless
forest
,
therefore
we
kept
on
undaunted
,
while
the
yellow
autumn
sun
struggled
through
the
dark
pines
,
glinting
on
the
straight
gray
trunks
and
reflecting
a
golden
light
in
that
dead
unbroken
silence
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
miles
we
trudged
I
have
no
idea
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
consolation
to
know
that
we
now
had
no
pursuers
,
yet
what
fate
lay
before
us
<EOS>
we
knew
not
.
<EOS>
If
we
could
only
find
that
forest
-
road
we
might
come
across
some
wood
-
cutter
's
hut
,
where
we
could
obtain
rough
food
of
some
sort
,
yet
our
guide
,
used
as
he
was
to
those
enormous
woods
of
central
Finland
,
was
utterly
out
of
his
bearings
,
and
no
mark
of
civilization
attracted
his
quick
,
experienced
eye
.
<EOS>
The
light
above
gradually
faded
,
and
over
a
sharp
stone
Elma
stumbled
and
ripped
her
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
at
my
watch
,
and
found
that
it
was
already
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
In
an
hour
it
would
be
dark
,
the
beginning
of
the
long
northern
night
.
<EOS>
Elma
,
who
was
weary
and
footsore
,
asked
by
signs
to
be
permitted
to
lay
down
and
rest
.
<EOS>
Therefore
we
gathered
a
bed
of
dried
leaves
for
her
,
and
she
lay
down
,
and
while
we
watched
she
was
soon
asleep
.
<EOS>
The
Finn
,
who
declared
that
he
did
not
suffer
from
the
cold
,
removed
his
coat
and
placed
it
tenderly
upon
her
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
While
there
was
still
a
ray
of
light
I
watched
her
white
refined
features
as
she
slept
,
and
was
sorely
tempted
to
bend
and
imprint
a
kiss
upon
that
soft
inviting
cheek
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
had
no
right
to
do
so
--
no
right
to
take
such
an
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
The
long
cold
night
passed
wearily
,
and
the
howling
of
the
wolves
caused
me
to
grip
my
revolver
,
yet
at
daybreak
we
arose
refreshed
,
and
notwithstanding
the
terrible
pangs
of
hunger
now
gnawing
at
our
vitals
,
we
were
prepared
to
renew
our
desperate
dash
for
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
Although
I
had
paper
,
I
possessed
no
pencil
with
which
to
write
,
therefore
I
could
only
communicate
by
signs
with
the
mysterious
prisoner
of
Kajana
,
the
beautiful
dark
-
eyed
girl
who
held
me
irrevocably
beneath
the
spell
of
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
All
the
little
acts
of
homage
<EOS>
I
was
able
to
perform
she
accepted
with
a
quiet
,
calm
dignity
,
while
in
her
deep
luminous
eyes
I
read
an
unfathomable
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
The
mist
had
not
cleared
,
for
it
was
soon
after
dawn
when
we
again
moved
along
,
hungry
,
chill
,
and
yet
hopeful
.
<EOS>
At
a
spring
we
obtained
some
water
,
and
then
,
in
silent
procession
,
pressed
forward
in
search
of
the
rough
track
of
the
woodcutters
.
 
<EOS>
Elma
's
torn
shoe
gave
her
considerable
trouble
,
and
noticing
her
limping
,
I
induced
her
to
sit
down
while
I
took
it
off
,
hoping
to
be
able
to
mend
it
,
but
,
having
unlaced
it
,
I
saw
that
upon
her
stocking
was
a
large
patch
of
congealed
blood
,
where
her
foot
itself
had
also
been
cut
.
<EOS>
I
managed
to
beat
the
nails
of
the
shoe
with
a
stone
,
so
that
its
sole
should
not
be
lost
,
and
she
readjusted
it
,
allowing
me
to
lace
it
up
for
her
and
smiling
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
Forward
we
trudged
,
ever
forward
,
across
that
enormous
forest
where
the
myriad
treetrunks
presented
the
same
dismal
scene
everywhere
,
a
forest
untrodden
save
by
wild
,
half
-
savage
lumbermen
.
<EOS>
Throughout
that
dull
gray
day
we
marched
onward
,
faint
with
hunger
,
yet
suffering
but
little
pain
,
for
the
first
pangs
were
now
past
,
and
were
succeeded
by
slight
light
-
headedness
.
<EOS>
My
only
fear
was
that
we
should
be
compelled
to
spend
another
night
without
shelter
,
and
what
its
effect
might
be
upon
the
delicately
-
reared
girl
whose
hand
I
held
tenderly
in
mine
.
<EOS>
Surely
my
position
was
a
strange
one
.
<EOS>
Her
terrible
affliction
seemed
to
cause
her
to
be
entirely
dependent
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
just
as
the
yellow
sunlight
overhead
had
begun
to
fade
,
the
flat
-
faced
Finn
,
whose
name
he
had
told
me
was
Felix
Estlander
,
cried
joyfully--
 
<EOS>
"
_
Polushaite
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Look
,
Excellency
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
The
road
at
last
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
we
glanced
before
us
we
saw
that
his
quick
,
well
-
trained
eyes
had
detected
away
in
the
twilight
,
at
some
distance
,
a
path
traversing
our
vista
among
the
gray
-
green
tree
-
trunks
.
<EOS>
Then
,
hurrying
along
,
we
found
ourselves
upon
a
track
,
on
which
we
turned
to
the
right
--
a
track
,
rough
and
deeply
-
rutted
by
the
felled
trunks
that
were
dragged
along
it
to
the
nearest
river
.
 
<EOS>
Elma
made
a
gesture
of
renewed
hope
,
and
all
three
of
us
redoubled
our
pace
,
expecting
every
moment
to
come
upon
some
log
hut
,
the
owner
of
which
would
surely
give
us
hospitality
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
But
darkness
came
on
quickly
,
and
yet
we
still
pushed
forward
.
<EOS>
Poor
Elma
was
limping
,
and
I
knew
that
her
injured
foot
was
paining
her
,
even
though
she
could
tell
me
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
after
walking
for
nearly
four
hours
in
the
almost
impenetrable
forest
gloom
,
always
fearing
lest
we
might
miss
the
path
,
our
hearts
suddenly
beat
quickly
by
seeing
before
us
a
light
shining
in
a
window
,
and
five
minutes
later
Felix
was
knocking
at
the
door
,
and
asking
in
Finnish
the
occupant
to
give
hospitality
to
a
lady
lost
in
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
We
heard
a
low
growl
like
a
muttered
imprecation
within
,
and
when
the
door
opened
there
stood
upon
the
threshold
a
tall
,
bearded
,
muscular
old
fellow
in
a
dirty
red
shirt
,
with
a
big
revolver
shining
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
A
quick
glance
at
us
satisfied
him
that
we
were
not
thieves
,
and
he
invited
us
in
while
Felix
explained
that
we
had
landed
from
the
lake
,
and
our
boat
having
drifted
away
<EOS>
we
had
been
compelled
to
take
to
the
woods
.
<EOS>
The
man
heard
the
Finn
's
picturesque
story
,
and
then
said
something
to
me
which
Felix
translated
into
Russian
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Excellency
is
welcome
to
all
the
poor
fare
he
has
.
<EOS>
He
gives
up
his
bed
in
the
room
yonder
to
the
lady
,
so
that
she
may
rest
.
<EOS>
He
is
honored
by
your
Excellency
's
presence
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
while
he
was
making
this
explanation
the
herculean
wood
-
cutter
in
the
red
shirt
stirred
the
red
embers
whereon
a
big
pot
was
simmering
,
and
sending
forth
an
appetizing
odor
,
and
in
five
minutes
we
were
all
three
sitting
down
to
a
stew
of
capercailzie
,
with
a
foaming
light
beer
as
a
fitting
beverage
.
<EOS>
We
finished
the
dish
with
such
lightning
rapidity
that
our
host
boiled
us
a
number
of
eggs
,
which
,
I
fear
,
denuded
his
larder
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
was
a
poor
one
of
two
low
rooms
,
built
of
rough
log
-
pines
,
with
double
windows
for
the
winter
and
a
high
brick
stove
.
<EOS>
Cleanliness
was
not
exactly
its
characteristic
,
nevertheless
we
all
passed
a
very
comfortable
hour
,
and
received
a
warm
welcome
from
the
lonely
old
fellow
who
passed
his
life
so
far
beyond
European
civilization
,
and
whose
house
,
he
told
us
,
was
often
snowed
up
and
cut
off
from
all
the
world
for
three
or
four
months
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
After
we
had
finished
our
meal
,
I
asked
the
sturdy
old
fellow
for
a
pencil
,
but
the
nearest
thing
he
possessed
was
a
stick
of
thick
charcoal
,
and
with
that
it
was
surely
difficult
to
communicate
with
our
fair
companion
.
<EOS>
Therefore
she
rose
,
gave
me
her
hand
,
bowed
smilingly
,
and
then
passed
into
the
inner
room
and
closed
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
wood
-
cutter
gave
us
some
coarse
tobacco
,
and
after
smoking
and
chatting
for
an
hour
we
threw
ourselves
wearily
upon
the
wooden
benches
and
slept
soundly
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
at
early
dawn
,
we
were
startled
by
a
loud
banging
at
the
door
,
the
clattering
of
hoofs
,
and
authoritative
shouts
in
Russian
.
<EOS>
The
old
wood
-
cutter
sprang
up
,
and
looking
through
a
chink
in
the
heavy
shutters
turned
to
us
with
blanched
face
,
whispering
breathlessly--
 
<EOS>
"
The
police
!
<EOS>
What
can
they
want
of
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Open
!
"
shouted
the
horsemen
outside
.
<EOS>
"
Open
in
the
name
of
his
Majesty
!
"
 
<EOS>
Felix
<EOS>
and
I
sprang
up
facing
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
entrapped
!
"
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
our
guide
Felix
made
a
dash
for
the
door
of
the
inner
room
where
Elma
had
retired
,
but
next
second
he
reappeared
,
gasping
in
Russian--
 
"
Excellency
!
<EOS>
Why
,
the
door
is
open
!
<EOS>
The
lady
has
gone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
<EOS>
I
cried
,
dismayed
,
rushing
into
the
little
room
,
where
I
found
the
truckle
couch
empty
,
and
the
door
leading
outside
wide
open
.
<EOS>
She
had
actually
disappeared
!
 
<EOS>
The
police
again
battered
at
the
opposite
door
,
threatening
loudly
to
break
it
in
if
it
were
not
opened
at
once
,
whereupon
the
old
wood
-
cutter
drew
the
bolt
and
admitted
them
.
<EOS>
Two
big
,
hulking
fellows
in
heavy
riding
-
coats
and
swords
strode
in
,
while
two
others
remained
mounted
outside
,
holding
the
horses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
names
?
"
demanded
one
of
the
fellows
,
glancing
at
us
as
we
stood
together
in
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
Our
host
told
them
his
name
,
and
asked
why
they
wished
to
enter
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
searching
for
a
woman
who
has
escaped
from
Kajana
,
"
was
the
reply
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
any
woman
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
responded
the
wood
-
cutter
.
<EOS>
"
We
never
see
any
woman
out
in
these
woods
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
police
-
officer
strode
into
the
inner
room
,
glanced
around
to
make
certain
that
no
one
was
concealed
there
,
and
then
returning
to
me
asked
,
"
Who
are
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
own
affair
,
"
I
answered
.
 
<EOS>
The
mystery
of
Elma
's
disappearance
while
we
had
slept
annoyed
me
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
have
fled
from
me
in
secret
.
<EOS>
Yet
could
she
have
received
some
warning
that
the
police
were
in
search
of
her
?
<EOS>
She
was
deaf
,
therefore
she
could
not
have
been
alarmed
by
the
banging
on
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
identity
is
my
affair
,
"
declared
<EOS>
the
man
with
the
fair
,
bristly
beard
,
an
average
type
of
the
uncouth
officer
of
police
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
your
chief
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
as
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Melnikoff
,
at
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
this
is
not
in
the
district
of
Abo
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
But
what
difference
does
it
make
?
<EOS>
Who
are
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gordon
Gregg
,
British
subject
,
"
<EOS>
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
the
drosky
-
driver
from
Abo
,
"
remarked
the
fellow
,
turning
to
Felix
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
as
I
thought
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
pair
who
bribed
the
nun
at
Kajana
,
and
succeeded
in
releasing
the
Englishwoman
.
<EOS>
In
the
name
of
the
Czar
,
I
arrest
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
old
wood
-
cutter
turned
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
We
certainly
were
in
grave
peril
,
for
I
foresaw
the
danger
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
Baron
Oberg
,
the
Strangler
of
Finland
.
<EOS>
Yet
we
had
a
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
,
be
the
mystery
<EOS>
what
it
might
,
Elma
had
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
on
what
charge
,
pray
,
do
you
presume
to
arrest
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
as
coolly
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
aiding
a
prisoner
to
escape
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
wish
to
say
,
first
,
that
you
have
no
power
to
arrest
me
;
and
,
secondly
,
that
if
you
wish
me
to
give
you
satisfaction
,
I
am
perfectly
willing
to
do
so
,
providing
you
first
accompany
me
down
to
Abo
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
outside
my
district
,
"
growled
the
fellow
,
but
I
saw
that
his
hesitancy
was
due
to
his
uncertainty
as
to
whom
I
really
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
desire
you
to
take
me
to
the
Chief
of
Police
Boranski
,
who
will
make
all
the
explanation
necessary
.
<EOS>
Until
we
have
an
interview
with
him
,
I
refuse
to
give
any
information
concerning
myself
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
a
passport
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
drew
it
from
my
pocket
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
It
proves
,
I
think
,
that
my
name
is
what
I
have
told
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
fellow
,
standing
astride
,
read
it
,
and
handed
it
back
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
woman
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
was
my
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
tell
me
,
"
he
said
,
turning
to
the
old
wood
-
cutter
with
a
sinister
expression
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
these
fugitives
are
found
in
your
house
,
and
you
are
liable
to
arrest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
--
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
n't
!
"
protested
the
old
fellow
,
trembling
beneath
the
officer
's
threat
.
<EOS>
Like
all
his
class
,
he
feared
the
police
,
and
held
them
in
dread
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
do
n't
remember
,
I
suppose
!
<EOS>
"
he
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
perhaps
your
memory
will
be
refreshed
by
a
month
or
two
in
prison
.
<EOS>
You
are
also
arrested
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
your
Excellency
,
I--
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
blared
the
bristly
officer
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
given
shelter
to
conspirators
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
penalty
in
Finland
for
that
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
these
gentlemen
are
surely
not
conspirators
!
"
<EOS>
the
poor
old
man
protested
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
Excellency
is
English
,
and
the
English
do
not
plot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
afterwards
,
"
he
laughed
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
turning
to
the
agent
of
police
at
his
side
,
he
gave
him
orders
to
search
the
log
-
hut
carefully
,
an
investigation
in
which
one
of
the
men
from
the
outside
joined
.
<EOS>
They
upset
everything
and
pried
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
find
papers
or
letters
,
"
said
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
Search
thoroughly
.
"
<EOS>
And
in
every
corner
they
rummaged
,
even
to
taking
up
a
number
of
boards
in
the
inner
room
which
Elma
had
occupied
.
<EOS>
But
they
found
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
A
dozen
times
was
the
old
wood
-
cutter
questioned
,
but
he
stubbornly
refused
to
admit
that
he
had
ever
set
eyes
upon
Elma
,
while
I
insisted
on
my
right
to
return
to
Abo
and
see
Boranski
.
<EOS>
I
knew
,
of
course
,
by
what
we
had
overheard
said
by
the
prison
-
guards
,
that
the
Governor
-
General
was
extremely
anxious
to
recapture
the
girl
with
whom
,
I
frankly
admit
,
I
had
now
so
utterly
fallen
in
love
.
<EOS>
And
it
appeared
that
no
effort
was
being
spared
to
search
for
us
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
whole
of
the
police
in
the
provinces
of
Abo
and
of
Helsingfors
seemed
to
be
actively
making
a
house
-
to
-
house
search
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
could
be
the
truth
of
Elma
's
disappearance
?
<EOS>
Had
she
fled
of
her
own
accord
,
or
had
she
once
more
fallen
a
victim
to
some
ingenious
and
dastardly
plot
.
<EOS>
That
gray
dress
of
hers
might
,
I
recollected
,
betray
her
if
she
dared
to
venture
near
any
town
,
while
her
affliction
would
,
of
itself
,
be
plain
evidence
of
identification
.
<EOS>
All
I
hoped
was
that
she
had
gone
and
hidden
herself
in
the
forest
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
to
wait
until
the
danger
of
recapture
had
passed
.
 
<EOS>
For
nearly
half
an
hour
I
argued
with
the
police
officer
whose
intention
it
was
to
take
me
under
arrest
to
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
Once
there
,
however
,
I
knew
too
well
that
my
liberty
would
be
probably
gone
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Whatever
was
the
Baron
's
motive
in
holding
the
poor
girl
a
prisoner
,
it
would
also
be
his
motive
to
silence
me
.
<EOS>
I
knew
too
much
for
his
liking
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
refuse
to
go
to
Helsingfors
,
"
I
said
defiantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
British
subject
,
and
demand
to
be
taken
back
to
the
port
where
my
passport
was
vised
.
<EOS>
"
This
argument
I
repeated
time
after
time
,
until
at
length
I
succeeded
in
convincing
him
that
I
really
had
a
right
to
be
taken
to
Abo
,
and
to
seek
the
aid
of
the
British
Vice
-
Consul
if
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
For
as
long
as
possible
I
succeeded
in
delaying
our
departure
,
but
at
length
,
just
as
the
yellow
sun
began
to
struggle
through
the
gray
clouds
,
we
were
all
three
compelled
to
depart
in
sorrowful
procession
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
we
wondered
,
had
really
happened
to
Elma
?
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
she
had
not
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
police
;
nevertheless
,
the
fact
that
the
door
of
the
inner
room
was
open
caused
them
to
look
upon
the
statement
of
the
wood
-
cutter
with
distinct
suspicion
and
disbelief
.
 
<EOS>
Our
captors
seemed
quite
well
aware
of
all
the
circumstances
of
our
escape
from
Kajana
,
and
were
consequently
filled
with
chagrin
that
Elma
,
the
person
they
so
much
desired
to
recapture
,
had
slipped
through
their
fingers
.
<EOS>
While
the
police
rode
,
we
were
compelled
to
walk
before
them
,
and
after
trudging
ten
miles
or
so
through
the
forest
we
came
across
another
small
posse
of
police
,
who
were
apparently
in
search
of
us
,
for
they
expressed
delight
when
they
saw
us
under
arrest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
woman
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
one
officer
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Still
at
liberty
,
"
replied
the
man
who
held
us
as
prisoners
.
"
<EOS>
In
hiding
twenty
versts
back
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
we
shall
find
her
before
long
,
"
he
said
confidently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Within
twelve
hours
we
shall
have
searched
the
whole
forest
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
escape
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Our
captors
explained
who
we
were
,
and
then
we
were
pushed
forward
again
,
skirting
a
great
wide
lake
called
the
Nasjarvi
,
along
the
wooded
shore
of
which
we
walked
the
whole
day
long
until
,
at
sundown
,
we
came
to
a
picturesque
little
log
-
built
town
facing
the
water
,
called
Filppula
.
<EOS>
Here
we
obtained
a
hasty
meal
,
and
afterwards
took
the
train
down
to
Abo
,
where
we
arrived
next
morning
,
after
a
very
uncomfortable
and
sleepless
journey
.
 
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
I
stood
in
the
big
bare
office
of
Michael
Boranski
,
where
only
a
few
days
before
we
had
had
such
a
heated
argument
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
Chief
of
Police
entered
,
he
recognized
me
under
arrest
,
and
dismissed
my
guards
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
--
all
save
the
officer
who
had
brought
me
there
.
<EOS>
The
Finnish
driver
and
the
old
wood
-
cutter
were
in
another
room
,
therefore
I
stood
alone
with
the
police
-
officer
of
Helsingfors
and
the
Chief
of
Police
at
Abo
.
<EOS>
The
latter
listened
to
the
officer
's
story
of
my
arrest
without
saying
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
prisoner
,
your
Excellency
,
desired
to
be
brought
here
to
you
before
being
taken
to
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
He
said
you
would
be
aware
of
the
facts
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
I
am
,
"
remarked
Boranski
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
You
must
at
once
release
this
gentleman
and
the
other
two
prisoners
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
Excellency
,
the
Governor
-
General
has
issued
orders
for
the
prisoner
's
arrest
and
deportation
to
Helsingfors
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
Chief
of
Police
in
Abo
,
and
I
release
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
officer
looked
at
me
in
such
blank
astonishment
that
I
could
not
resist
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
well
aware
of
the
reason
of
this
Englishman
's
visit
to
the
north
,
"
added
Boranski
.
<EOS>
"
More
need
not
be
said
.
<EOS>
Has
the
lady
been
arrested
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
your
Excellency
.
<EOS>
Every
effort
is
being
made
to
find
her
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Smirnoff
has
already
been
relieved
of
his
post
as
Governor
of
Kajana
,
and
many
of
the
guards
are
under
arrest
for
complicity
in
the
plot
to
allow
the
woman
to
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
see
from
the
despatches
that
a
reward
is
offered
for
her
recapture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Governor
-
General
is
determined
that
she
shall
not
escape
,
"
remarked
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
probably
hidden
in
the
forest
,
somewhere
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
They
are
making
a
thorough
search
over
every
verst
of
it
.
<EOS>
If
she
is
there
,
she
will
most
certainly
be
found
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
remarked
Boranski
,
leaning
back
in
his
padded
chair
and
looking
at
me
meaningly
across
the
littered
table
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
I
wish
to
speak
to
this
Englishman
privately
,
so
please
leave
us
.
<EOS>
Also
inform
the
other
two
prisoners
that
they
are
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
your
Excellency
does
this
upon
his
own
responsibility
,
"
he
said
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remember
that
I
brought
them
to
you
under
arrest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
release
them
entirely
at
my
own
discretion
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
As
Chief
of
Police
of
this
province
,
I
am
permitted
to
use
my
jurisdiction
,
and
I
exercise
it
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
You
are
liberty
to
report
that
at
Helsingfors
,
if
you
so
desire
,
but
I
should
suggest
that
you
say
nothing
unless
absolutely
obliged
--
you
understand
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
Boranski
spoke
apparently
decided
my
captor
,
for
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
he
said
,
saluting
:
 
"
If
that
is
really
your
wish
,
then
I
will
obey
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
left
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excellency
!
"
exclaimed
the
Chief
of
Police
,
rising
quickly
and
walking
towards
me
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
,
and
we
were
alone
,
"
you
have
had
a
very
narrow
escape
--
<EOS>
very
.
<EOS>
I
did
my
best
to
assist
you
.
<EOS>
I
succeeded
in
bribing
the
water
-
guards
at
Kajana
in
order
that
you
might
secure
the
lady
's
release
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
that
just
at
the
very
moment
when
you
were
about
to
get
away
one
of
the
guards
turned
informer
and
roused
the
governor
of
the
castle
,
with
the
result
that
you
all
three
nearly
lost
your
lives
.
<EOS>
The
whole
matter
has
been
reported
to
me
officially
,
and
,
"
he
added
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
my
men
are
now
searching
everywhere
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
is
Baron
Oberg
so
extremely
anxious
to
recapture
Miss
Heath
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
idea
,
"
was
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
The
secret
orders
from
Helsingfors
to
me
are
to
arrest
her
at
all
hazards
--
alive
or
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Which
means
that
the
Baron
would
not
regret
if
she
was
dead
,
"
I
remarked
,
in
response
to
which
he
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
of
the
faithful
services
of
Felix
,
the
Finlander
<EOS>
,
whereupon
he
said
simply
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
that
you
might
trust
him
implicitly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
now
that
you
have
shown
yourself
my
friend
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
,
"
you
will
assist
Miss
Heath
to
escape
this
man
,
who
desires
to
hold
her
prisoner
in
that
awful
place
.
<EOS>
They
are
driving
her
mad
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
best
,
"
he
answered
,
but
shaking
his
head
dubiously
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
recollect
that
Baron
Oberg
is
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
,
with
all
the
powers
of
the
Czar
himself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
Elma
Heath
again
falls
into
his
unscrupulous
hands
,
she
will
die
,
"
I
declared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
sighed
,
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
,
"
I
fear
that
what
you
say
is
only
too
true
.
<EOS>
She
evidently
holds
some
secret
which
he
fears
she
will
reveal
.
<EOS>
He
wishes
to
rearrest
her
in
order
--
<EOS>
well--
<EOS>
"
he
added
in
a
low
tone
,
"
in
order
to
close
her
lips
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
persons
have
been
silenced
in
secret
at
Kajana
.
<EOS>
Many
fatal
accidents
take
place
in
that
fortress
,
you
know
.
"
    
CHAPTER
XII
 
<EOS>
"
THE
STRANGLER
"
  
<EOS>
Where
was
Elma
?
<EOS>
What
was
the
cause
of
her
inexplicable
disappearance
into
the
gloomy
forest
while
we
had
slept
?
 
<EOS>
I
returned
to
the
hotel
where
I
had
stayed
on
my
arrival
,
a
comfortable
place
called
the
Phoenix
,
and
lunched
there
alone
.
<EOS>
Both
Felix
,
the
Finn
,
and
my
host
,
the
wood
-
cutter
,
had
received
their
_
douceurs
_
and
left
,
but
to
the
last
-
named
I
had
given
instructions
to
return
home
at
once
and
report
by
telegraph
any
news
of
my
lost
one
.
 
<EOS>
A
thousand
conflicting
thoughts
arose
within
me
as
I
sat
in
that
crowded
_
salle
-
a
-
manger
<EOS>
_
filled
with
a
gobbling
crowd
of
the
commercial
men
of
Abo
.
<EOS>
I
had
,
I
recognized
,
now
to
deal
with
the
most
powerful
man
in
that
country
,
and
I
suffered
a
distinct
disadvantage
by
being
in
ignorance
of
the
reason
he
held
that
sweet
English
girl
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
tragedy
of
the
dastardly
manner
in
which
she
had
been
willfully
maimed
caused
my
blood
to
boil
within
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
believed
that
in
this
civilized
twentieth
century
such
things
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
Michael
Boranski
had
given
his
pledge
to
assist
me
,
yet
he
had
most
plainly
explained
to
me
his
fears
.
<EOS>
The
Baron
was
intent
upon
again
getting
Elma
into
his
power
.
<EOS>
Was
it
at
his
orders
,
I
wondered
,
that
the
sweet
-
faced
girl
had
been
deprived
of
speech
and
hearing
?
<EOS>
Had
she
fallen
an
innocent
victim
to
his
infamous
scheming
?
 
<EOS>
About
me
men
were
eating
strange
dishes
and
talking
in
Finnish
,
while
others
were
smoking
and
drinking
their
vodka
;
but
I
was
in
no
mood
for
observation
.
<EOS>
My
only
thought
was
of
she
who
was
now
lost
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
had
she
disappeared
without
warning
I
was
at
loss
to
imagine
,
yet
I
could
only
surmise
that
her
flight
had
been
compulsory
.
<EOS>
Some
women
possess
a
mysterious
sense
of
intuition
,
a
curious
and
indescribable
faculty
of
knowing
when
evil
threatens
them
,
that
presents
a
strange
and
puzzling
problem
to
our
scientists
.
<EOS>
It
is
unaccountable
,
and
yet
many
women
possess
it
in
a
very
marked
degree
.
<EOS>
Was
it
,
therefore
,
possible
that
Elma
had
awakened
,
and
being
warned
of
her
peril
had
fled
without
arousing
us
?
<EOS>
The
suggestion
was
possible
,
but
I
feared
improbable
.
 
<EOS>
Another
very
curious
feature
in
the
affair
was
the
sudden
manner
in
which
Michael
Boranski
had
exerted
his
power
and
influence
in
order
to
render
me
that
service
.
<EOS>
He
had
actually
bribed
the
guards
of
Kajana
;
he
had
instructed
the
faithful
Felix
,
he
had
provided
our
boat
,
and
he
had
ordered
the
nun
to
open
the
water
-
gate
to
me
.
<EOS>
Why
?
 
<EOS>
There
was
,
<EOS>
I
felt
convinced
,
some
hidden
motive
in
all
that
sudden
and
marked
friendliness
.
<EOS>
That
he
really
hated
the
English
I
had
seen
plainly
when
we
had
first
met
,
and
I
had
only
compelled
him
to
serve
me
by
presenting
the
order
signed
by
the
Emperor
,
which
made
me
his
guest
within
the
Russian
dominions
.
<EOS>
Even
that
document
did
not
account
for
the
length
he
had
gone
to
secure
the
release
of
the
woman
I
now
loved
in
secret
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
thought
it
over
,
the
more
anxious
did
I
become
.
<EOS>
I
could
discern
no
motive
for
his
friendliness
,
and
,
truth
to
tell
,
I
always
distrust
those
who
are
too
friendly
.
<EOS>
What
straight
and
decided
line
of
action
should
I
take
?
<EOS>
Carefully
I
went
over
all
the
strange
events
that
had
happened
in
England
,
and
while
anxious
to
obtain
some
solution
of
the
amazing
problem
,
yet
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
leave
Finland
,
and
allow
Elma
to
fall
into
the
clutches
of
that
high
official
who
so
persistently
sought
her
end
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
would
go
to
him
and
face
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
anxious
to
see
what
manner
of
man
was
"
The
Strangler
of
Finland
.
"
<EOS>
Therefore
,
that
same
evening
I
left
Abo
,
and
traveled
by
rail
up
to
the
junction
<EOS>
Toijala
,
whence
<EOS>
,
after
a
wait
of
six
hours
,
I
resumed
by
slow
journey
to
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
I
put
up
at
Kamp
's
,
an
elegant
hotel
on
the
long
esplanade
overlooking
the
port
,
and
found
the
town
,
with
its
handsome
streets
and
spacious
squares
,
to
be
a
much
finer
place
than
I
had
believed
.
<EOS>
When
I
inquired
of
the
French
director
of
my
hotel
for
the
residence
of
his
Excellency
,
the
Governor
-
General
,
he
regarded
me
with
some
surprise
,
saying
:
 
"
The
Baron
lives
up
at
the
Palace
,
m'sieur
--
<EOS>
that
great
building
opposite
the
Salutong
.
<EOS>
The
driver
of
your
drosky
will
point
it
out
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
his
Excellency
in
Helsingfors
at
the
present
moment
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Baron
never
leaves
the
Palace
,
m'sieur
,
"
responded
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
strange
country
,
you
know
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
grin
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
said
that
his
Excellency
is
in
hourly
fear
of
assassination
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
without
cause
,
"
I
remarked
in
a
low
voice
,
at
which
he
elevated
his
shoulders
and
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
At
noon
I
descended
from
a
drosky
before
a
long
,
gray
,
massive
building
,
over
the
big
doorway
of
which
<EOS>
was
a
large
escutcheon
bearing
the
Russian
arms
emblazoned
in
gold
,
and
on
entering
where
a
sentry
stood
on
either
side
,
a
colossal
concierge
in
livery
of
bright
blue
and
gold
came
forward
to
meet
me
,
asking
in
Russian
:
 
<EOS>
"
Whom
do
you
wish
to
see
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Excellency
,
the
Governor
-
General
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
an
appointment
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Excellency
sees
no
one
without
an
appointment
,
"
the
man
told
me
somewhat
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
here
on
public
business
,
but
upon
a
private
matter
,
"
I
explained
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
may
see
his
Excellency
's
secretary
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
wish
,
but
I
repeat
that
his
Excellency
sees
no
one
without
a
previous
appointment
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
knew
this
quite
well
,
for
the
"
Strangler
of
Finland
,
"
fearful
of
assassination
,
was
as
unapproachable
as
the
Czar
himself
.
<EOS>
Following
the
directions
of
the
concierge
,
however
,
I
crossed
a
great
bare
courtyard
,
and
,
ascending
a
wide
stone
staircase
,
was
confronted
by
a
servant
,
who
,
on
hearing
my
inquiry
took
me
into
a
waiting
-
room
,
and
left
with
my
card
to
Colonel
Luganski
,
whom
he
informed
me
was
the
Baron
's
private
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
After
ten
minutes
or
so
the
man
returned
,
saying
:
 
"
The
Colonel
will
see
you
if
you
will
please
step
this
way
,
"
and
following
him
he
conducted
me
into
the
richly
furnished
private
apartments
of
the
Palace
,
across
a
great
hall
filled
with
fine
paintings
,
and
then
up
a
long
thickly
-
carpeted
passage
to
a
small
,
elegant
room
,
where
a
tall
bald
-
headed
man
in
military
uniform
stood
awaiting
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
name
is
M'sieur
Gregg
,
"
he
exclaimed
in
very
good
French
,
"
and
I
understand
you
desire
audience
of
his
Excellency
,
the
Governor
-
General
.
<EOS>
I
regret
,
however
,
that
he
never
gives
audience
to
strangers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
matter
upon
which
I
desire
to
see
his
Excellency
is
of
a
purely
private
and
confidential
nature
,
"
I
said
,
for
used
as
I
was
to
the
ways
of
foreign
officialdom
,
I
spoke
with
the
same
firm
courtesy
as
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
m'sieur
,
but
I
fear
it
will
be
necessary
in
that
case
for
you
to
write
to
his
Excellency
,
and
mark
your
letter
'
personal
.
'
<EOS>
It
will
then
go
into
the
Governor
-
General
's
own
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
to
say
can
not
be
committed
to
writing
,
"
was
my
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
Baron
Oberg
upon
a
matter
which
affects
him
personally
,
and
which
admits
of
no
delay
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
me
quickly
,
and
then
in
a
low
voice
inquired
:
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
in
regard
to
a
--
well
,
a
conspiracy
?
"
 
<EOS>
His
question
instantly
suggested
to
me
a
ruse
,
and
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
can
place
the
facts
before
me
without
the
slightest
hesitation
,
"
he
said
,
going
to
the
door
and
slipping
the
bolt
into
its
socket
.
<EOS>
"
Anything
spoken
into
my
ear
is
as
though
it
were
spoken
into
that
of
his
Excellency
himself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
much
regret
,
M'sieur
the
Colonel
,
that
I
must
see
the
Baron
in
person
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
the
plot
assassination
as
its
object
--
or
revolt
?
"
he
asked
pointedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
will
explain
to
the
Baron
only
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
you
he
will
not
see
you
.
<EOS>
We
have
so
many
persons
here
with
secret
information
concerning
Finnish
conspiracies
against
our
Russian
rule
.
<EOS>
Why
,
if
his
Excellency
saw
everyone
who
desired
to
see
him
,
he
would
be
compelled
to
give
audience
the
whole
twenty
-
four
hours
round
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
a
glance
I
saw
that
this
elegant
Colonel
,
who
seemed
to
take
the
greatest
pride
over
his
exquisitely
kept
person
and
his
spotless
uniform
,
did
not
intend
to
allow
me
the
satisfaction
of
an
audience
of
that
most
hated
official
of
the
Czar
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
in
fear
of
the
dagger
,
the
pistol
,
or
the
bomb
,
and
consequently
hedged
himself
in
by
persons
of
the
Colonel
's
type
--
courteous
,
diplomatic
,
but
utterly
unbending
.
<EOS>
After
some
further
argument
,
I
said
at
last
in
a
firm
tone
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
impress
upon
you
the
extreme
importance
of
the
information
I
have
to
impart
,
and
can
only
repeat
that
it
is
a
matter
concerning
his
Excellency
privately
.
<EOS>
Will
you
therefore
do
me
the
favor
to
take
my
name
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Excellency
refuses
to
be
troubled
with
the
names
of
strangers
,
"
was
his
cold
reply
,
as
he
turned
over
my
card
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
write
upon
it
the
nature
of
my
business
,
and
enclose
it
in
an
envelope
,
will
you
then
take
it
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitated
for
a
short
time
,
twisting
his
mustache
,
and
then
replied
with
great
reluctance
:
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
are
so
determined
,
you
may
write
your
business
upon
your
card
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
took
out
one
,
and
on
the
back
wrote
in
French
the
words
which
I
knew
must
have
the
effect
of
obtaining
an
audience
for
me
:
     
"
_
To
give
information
regarding
Miss
Elma
Heath
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
I
enclosed
in
the
envelope
he
handed
to
me
,
when
,
ringing
a
bell
,
he
handed
it
to
the
footman
who
appeared
,
with
orders
to
take
it
to
his
Excellency
and
await
a
reply
.
<EOS>
The
response
came
in
a
few
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
Excellency
will
give
audience
to
the
English
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
I
rose
and
followed
the
footman
through
several
wide
corridors
filled
with
palms
and
flowers
,
which
formed
a
kind
of
winter
-
garden
,
until
we
crossed
a
red
-
carpeted
ante
-
room
,
where
two
statuesque
sentries
stood
on
guard
,
and
the
man
conducting
me
rapped
at
the
great
polished
mahogany
doors
of
the
room
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
A
voice
responded
,
the
door
was
opened
,
and
I
found
myself
in
a
high
,
beautifully
-
painted
room
,
with
long
windows
hung
with
pastel
-
blue
silk
with
heavy
gilt
fringe
,
a
pastel
-
blue
carpet
,
and
upon
the
opposite
wall
a
great
canopy
of
rich
purple
velvet
bearing
the
double
-
headed
eagle
embroidered
in
gold
.
<EOS>
The
apartment
was
splendidly
decorated
,
and
in
the
center
of
the
parquet
floor
,
with
his
back
to
the
light
,
was
the
thin
,
wiry
figure
of
an
elderly
man
in
a
funereal
frock
-
coat
,
in
the
lapel
of
which
showed
the
red
and
yellow
ribbon
of
the
Order
of
Saint
Anne
.
<EOS>
His
hands
were
behind
his
back
,
and
he
stood
purposely
in
such
a
position
that
when
I
entered
I
could
not
at
first
see
his
face
against
the
strong
,
gray
light
behind
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
footman
had
bowed
and
retired
and
we
were
alone
,
he
turned
slightly
,
and
I
then
saw
that
his
bony
face
,
with
high
cheek
-
bones
,
slight
gray
side
-
whiskers
,
hard
mouth
and
black
eyes
set
closely
together
,
was
one
that
bore
the
mark
of
evil
upon
it
--
<EOS>
the
keen
,
sinister
countenance
of
one
who
could
act
without
any
compunction
and
without
regret
.
<EOS>
Truly
one
would
not
be
surprised
at
any
cruel
,
dastardly
action
of
a
man
with
such
a
face
--
the
face
of
an
oppressor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
he
snapped
in
French
in
a
high
-
pitched
voice
.
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
see
me
concerning
that
mad
English
girl
?
<EOS>
What
picturesque
<EOS>
lies
<EOS>
do
you
intend
to
tell
me
concerning
her
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
intention
of
telling
any
untruths
concerning
her
,
"
was
my
quick
response
,
as
I
faced
him
unflinchingly
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
told
me
sufficient
to--
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
told
you
something
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
guessed
as
much
.
<EOS>
I
expected
this
!
"
<EOS>
And
I
saw
that
his
thin
,
crafty
face
went
pale
,
while
his
eyes
glanced
evilly
upon
me
.
<EOS>
He
believed
that
she
had
revealed
to
me
her
secret
.
<EOS>
He
placed
his
hand
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
wherein
was
concealed
an
electric
button
,
and
next
instant
a
little
stout
man
in
shabby
black
appeared
as
though
by
magic
through
a
secret
door
hidden
in
the
dark
paneling
of
the
audience
chamber
--
the
man
who
was
his
personal
guard
against
the
plots
for
his
assassination
.
 
<EOS>
His
Excellency
spoke
,
and
the
words
he
uttered
staggered
me
.
<EOS>
I
stood
aghast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Seize
that
man
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
pointing
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
armed
!
<EOS>
He
has
just
threatened
to
kill
me
!
<EOS>
He
is
the
man
against
whom
we
were
recently
warned
--
the
Englishman
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
standing
before
the
thin
-
faced
official
of
the
Czar
,
the
unscrupulous
man
who
had
crushed
Finland
beneath
the
iron
heel
of
Russia
,
and
who
,
by
his
lying
allegation
,
now
held
me
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
your
object
,
Baron
Oberg
!
<EOS>
You
intend
to
arrest
me
as
a
conspirator
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Search
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
revolver
there
in
his
hip
-
pocket
,
"
declared
the
Governor
-
General
,
and
in
an
instant
the
short
,
ferret
-
eyed
little
man
had
run
his
hands
down
me
and
felt
my
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
I
drew
it
forth
and
handed
it
to
him
,
saying
:
 
"
You
are
quite
welcome
to
it
if
you
fear
that
I
am
here
with
any
sinister
motive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
obtained
admission
by
a
clever
ruse
,
"
the
Baron
explained
to
the
police
agent
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
threatened
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
untrue
,
"
I
protested
hotly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
merely
called
to
see
you
regarding
the
young
English
lady
,
Elma
Heath
--
the
unfortunate
lady
whom
you
consigned
to
the
fortress
of
Kajana
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
mad
woman
,
you
mean
!
"
<EOS>
he
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
mad
,
"
I
cried
,
"
but
as
sane
as
you
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
is
you
who
intended
that
the
horrors
of
the
castle
should
drive
her
insane
,
and
thus
your
secret
should
be
kept
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
suggest
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
,
stepping
a
few
paces
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
Xavier
Oberg
,
that
you
would
kill
Elma
Heath
if
you
dared
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
"
I
answered
plainly
,
as
I
faced
him
unflinchingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
?
"
he
laughed
,
turning
to
the
stout
man
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fellow
is
insane
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
dear
Malkoff
,
I
've
had
a
narrow
escape
!
<EOS>
He
came
here
intending
to
shoot
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
,
"
I
protested
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
to
demand
satisfaction
on
behalf
of
Miss
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh!--well
,
if
the
lady
cares
to
come
here
herself
,
I
will
give
her
the
satisfaction
she
desires
,
"
was
his
crafty
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
lady
has
escaped
you
,
and
it
is
therefore
hardly
likely
she
will
willingly
return
to
Helsingfors
,
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
you
who
succeeded
,
by
throwing
the
guard
into
the
water
,
in
abducting
her
from
the
castle
,
"
he
remarked
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
added
sneeringly
,
with
a
sinister
smile
,
"
I
presume
your
gallantry
was
prompted
by
affection
--
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
own
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
deaf
and
dumb
woman
is
surely
not
a
very
cheerful
companion
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
caused
her
that
affliction
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
hotly
.
<EOS>
"
When
she
was
at
Chichester
she
possessed
speech
and
hearing
as
other
girls
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
was
not
afflicted
when
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
<EOS>
in
Leghorn
harbor
only
a
few
months
ago
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
recollect
the
narrow
escape
the
yacht
had
on
the
Meloria
sands
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
met
mine
,
and
I
saw
by
his
drawn
face
and
narrow
brows
that
my
words
were
causing
him
the
utmost
consternation
.
<EOS>
My
object
was
to
make
him
believe
that
I
knew
more
than
I
really
did
--
to
hold
him
in
fear
,
in
fact
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
the
man
whom
some
know
as
Hornby
,
or
Woodroffe
,
could
tell
an
interesting
story
,
"
I
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
,
no
doubt
,
when
he
meets
Elma
Heath
,
and
finds
the
terrible
affliction
of
which
she
has
been
the
victim
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
thin
,
bony
countenance
was
bloodless
,
his
mouth
twitched
and
his
gray
brows
contracted
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
<EOS>
what
you
mean
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
he
stammered
.
<EOS>
"
All
that
you
say
is
entirely
enigmatical
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
to
do
with
this
mad
Englishwoman
's
affairs
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Send
out
this
man
,
"
I
said
,
pointing
to
the
detective
Malkoff
,
who
had
appeared
from
behind
the
paneling
of
the
audience
-
chamber
.
"
<EOS>
Send
him
out
,
and
I
will
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
representative
of
the
Czar
,
always
as
much
in
dread
of
assassination
as
his
imperial
master
,
refused
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
what
I
had
said
had
upset
him
,
and
that
he
was
not
at
all
clear
as
to
how
much
or
how
little
of
the
true
facts
I
knew
.
 
<EOS>
The
connection
between
the
little
miniature
cross
of
the
Order
of
St.
Anne
and
that
red
and
yellow
ribbon
in
his
button
-
hole
struck
me
forcibly
at
that
moment
,
and
I
said
:
 
"
I
have
no
desire
to
make
any
statements
before
a
second
person
.
<EOS>
I
came
here
to
see
you
privately
,
and
in
private
will
I
speak
.
<EOS>
I
have
certain
information
that
will
<EOS>
,
I
feel
confident
,
be
of
the
utmost
interest
to
you
--
concerning
another
woman
,
Armida
Santini
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
lips
were
pressed
together
,
and
I
noticed
how
he
started
when
I
uttered
the
name
of
that
woman
whom
I
had
found
dead
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
and
whose
body
had
so
mysteriously
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
on
earth
can
the
woman
concern
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
with
a
brave
attempt
to
remain
cool
,
still
speaking
in
French
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
that
you
knew
her
,
"
was
my
brief
reply
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
my
eyes
still
fixed
upon
his
,
I
asked
:
"
Will
you
not
now
request
this
gentleman
to
retire
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
dismissed
the
man
he
had
summoned
to
his
aid
.
<EOS>
A
moment
later
the
"
Strangler
's
"
personal
protector
had
disappeared
through
that
secret
door
in
the
paneling
by
which
he
had
entered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
asked
the
Baron
,
turning
quickly
to
me
again
,
his
dark
,
evil
eyes
trying
to
fathom
my
intentions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
,
pray
,
can
you
profit
by
denouncing
me
as
an
assassin
?
<EOS>
Remember
,
Baron
,
that
your
secret
is
mine
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
in
a
clear
voice
full
of
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
your
intention
is
blackmail
--
eh
?
"
he
snapped
,
walking
to
the
window
and
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
How
much
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
intention
is
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
My
object
is
to
avenge
the
outrageous
injury
to
Elma
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
That
is
only
natural
,
m'sieur
,
if
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
are
not
your
intentions
somewhat
ill
-
advised
considering
her
position
as
a
criminal
lunatic
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
neither
,
"
I
protested
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
You
know
better
than
myself
,
"
he
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
The
offense
for
which
she
was
condemned
to
confinement
in
a
fortress
was
the
attempted
assassination
of
Madame
Vakuroff
,
wife
of
the
General
commanding
the
Uleaborg
Military
Division
.
"
 
"
Assassination
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Have
you
actually
sent
her
to
prison
as
a
murderess
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
The
Criminal
Court
of
Abo
did
so
,
"
he
said
dryly
.
<EOS>
"
The
offense
has
since
been
proved
to
have
been
the
outcome
of
a
political
conspiracy
,
and
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
in
Petersburg
last
week
signed
an
order
for
the
prisoner
's
transportation
to
the
island
of
Saghalien
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
with
set
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
you
fear
lest
she
shall
write
down
your
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
insulting
!
<EOS>
You
evidently
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
,
"
he
exclaimed
resentfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
I
am
saying
quite
well
.
<EOS>
You
have
requested
her
removal
to
Saghalien
in
order
that
the
truth
shall
be
never
known
.
<EOS>
But
Baron
Oberg
,
"
I
added
with
mock
politeness
,
"
you
may
do
as
you
will
,
you
may
send
Elma
Heath
to
her
grave
,
you
may
hold
me
prisoner
if
you
dare
,
but
there
are
still
witnesses
of
your
crime
that
will
rise
against
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
he
went
ghastly
pale
,
and
I
knew
that
my
blind
shot
had
struck
its
mark
.
<EOS>
The
man
before
me
was
guilty
of
some
crime
,
but
what
it
was
only
Elma
herself
could
tell
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
had
her
arrested
for
an
attempted
political
assassination
<EOS>
only
showed
how
ingeniously
and
craftily
the
heartless
ruler
of
that
ruined
country
had
laid
his
plans
.
<EOS>
He
feared
Elma
,
and
therefore
had
conspired
to
have
her
sent
out
to
that
dismal
penal
island
in
the
far
-
off
Pacific
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
fear
arrest
,
m'sieur
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
as
though
with
some
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
--
at
least
,
not
arrest
by
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
the
representative
of
the
Emperor
in
Finland
,
but
even
here
there
is
justice
for
the
innocent
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
sinister
smile
played
around
the
thin
,
gray
lips
of
the
man
whose
very
name
was
hated
through
the
great
empire
of
the
Czar
,
and
was
synonymous
of
oppression
,
injustice
,
and
heartless
tyranny
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
I
can
repeat
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
that
if
you
bring
the
young
Englishwoman
here
I
shall
be
quite
prepared
to
hear
her
appeal
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
laughed
harshly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ask
that
because
you
know
it
is
impossible
,
"
I
said
,
whereat
he
again
laughed
in
my
face
--
a
laugh
which
made
me
wonder
whether
Elma
had
not
already
fallen
into
his
hands
.
<EOS>
The
uncertainty
of
her
fate
held
me
in
terrible
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
merely
wish
to
impress
upon
you
the
fact
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
interest
whatsoever
in
the
person
in
question
,
"
he
said
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
formed
some
romantic
attachment
towards
this
young
woman
who
attempted
to
poison
Madame
Vakuroff
,
and
to
have
succeeded
in
rescuing
her
from
Kajana
.
<EOS>
You
afterwards
disregard
the
fact
that
you
are
liable
to
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
yourself
,
and
actually
have
the
audacity
to
seek
audience
of
me
and
make
all
sorts
of
hints
and
suggestions
that
I
have
held
the
woman
a
prisoner
for
my
own
ends
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
only
do
I
repeat
that
,
Baron
Oberg
,
"
I
said
quickly
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
also
allege
that
it
was
at
your
instigation
that
in
Siena
an
operation
was
performed
upon
the
unfortunate
girl
which
deprived
her
of
speech
and
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
my
instigation
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
at
yours
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
laughed
again
,
but
uneasily
,
a
forced
laugh
,
and
leaned
against
the
edge
of
the
big
writing
-
table
near
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
next
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
pretending
to
be
interested
in
my
allegations
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
of
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
desire
you
to
give
the
Mademoiselle
Heath
her
complete
freedom
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
--
for
the
present
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
her
future
is
not
in
my
hands
.
<EOS>
The
Minister
in
Petersburg
has
decreed
her
removal
to
Saghalien
as
a
person
dangerous
to
the
State
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Which
means
that
she
will
be
ill
-
treated
--
knouted
to
death
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
use
the
knout
in
the
Russian
prisons
nowadays
,
"
he
said
briefly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
Majesty
has
decreed
its
abolition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
adopt
torture
in
Kajana
and
Schusselburg
instead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
time
is
too
limited
to
discuss
our
penal
system
,
m'sieur
,
"
he
exclaimed
impatiently
,
while
I
could
well
see
that
he
was
anxious
to
escape
before
I
made
any
further
charges
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
had
already
shown
him
that
Elma
had
spoken
,
and
he
feared
that
she
had
told
the
truth
.
<EOS>
While
this
would
embitter
him
against
her
and
cause
him
to
seek
to
silence
her
at
all
hazards
,
it
was
of
course
in
my
own
interests
that
he
should
fear
any
revelations
that
I
might
make
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
posed
in
England
as
the
uncle
of
Elma
Heath
,
and
yet
you
here
hold
her
prisoner
.
<EOS>
For
what
reason
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
held
prisoner
by
the
State
--
for
conspiracy
against
Russian
rule
--
not
by
herself
personally
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
enticed
her
here
?
<EOS>
Why
you
,
yourself
.
<EOS>
Who
conspired
to
throw
the
guilt
of
this
attempted
murder
of
the
general
's
wife
upon
her
?
<EOS>
You
--
you
,
the
man
whom
they
call
'
The
Strangler
of
Finland
'
!
<EOS>
But
I
will
avenge
the
cruel
and
abominable
affliction
you
have
placed
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Her
secret
--
your
secret
,
Baron
Oberg
--
shall
be
published
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
You
are
her
enemy
--
and
therefore
mine
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
he
growled
between
his
teeth
,
advancing
towards
me
threateningly
,
his
fists
clenched
in
his
rage
.
"
<EOS>
Recollect
,
m'sieur
,
that
you
have
insulted
me
.
<EOS>
Recollect
that
I
am
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
Czar
himself
,
I
should
not
hesitate
to
denounce
you
as
the
tyrant
and
mutilator
of
a
poor
defenseless
woman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
to
whom
,
pray
,
will
you
tell
this
romantic
story
of
yours
?
"
<EOS>
he
laughed
hoarsely
.
<EOS>
"
To
your
prison
walls
below
the
lake
at
Kajana
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
M'sieur
Gregg
,
you
will
go
there
,
and
once
within
the
fortress
you
shall
never
again
see
the
light
of
day
.
<EOS>
You
threaten
me
--
the
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
!
"
<EOS>
he
laughed
in
a
strange
,
high
-
pitched
key
as
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
scribbled
something
rapidly
upon
paper
,
appending
his
signature
in
his
small
crabbed
handwriting
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
threaten
,
"
I
said
in
open
defiance
,
"
I
shall
act
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
shall
I
,
"
he
said
with
an
evil
grin
upon
his
bony
face
as
he
blotted
what
he
had
written
and
took
it
up
,
adding
:
"
In
the
darkness
and
silence
of
your
living
tomb
,
you
can
tell
whatever
strange
stories
you
like
concerning
me
.
<EOS>
They
are
used
to
idiots
where
you
are
going
,
"
he
added
grimly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
And
where
am
I
going
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Back
to
Kanaja
.
<EOS>
This
order
consigns
you
to
confinement
there
as
a
dangerous
political
conspirator
,
as
one
who
has
threatened
me
--
it
consigns
you
to
the
cells
below
the
lake
--
for
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
laughed
aloud
,
and
my
hand
sought
my
wallet
wherein
<EOS>
was
that
all
-
powerful
document
--
the
order
of
the
Emperor
which
gave
me
,
as
an
imperial
guest
,
immunity
from
arrest
.
<EOS>
I
would
produce
it
as
my
trump
-
card
.
 
<EOS>
Next
second
,
however
,
I
held
my
breath
,
and
I
think
I
must
have
turned
pale
.
<EOS>
My
pocket
was
empty
!
<EOS>
My
wallet
had
been
stolen
!
<EOS>
Entirely
and
helplessly
I
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
tyrant
of
the
Czar
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
personal
interest
would
be
to
consign
me
to
a
living
tomb
in
that
grim
fortress
of
Kajana
,
the
horrors
of
which
were
unspeakable
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
enough
during
my
inspection
of
the
Russian
prisons
as
a
journalist
to
know
that
there
,
in
strangled
Finland
,
I
should
not
be
treated
with
the
same
consideration
or
humanity
as
in
Petersburg
or
Warsaw
.
<EOS>
The
Governor
-
General
consigned
me
to
Kajana
as
a
"
political
,
"
which
was
synonymous
with
a
sentence
of
death
in
those
damp
,
dark
_
oubliettes
_
beneath
the
water
-
dungeons
every
whit
as
awful
as
those
of
the
Paris
Bastile
.
 
<EOS>
We
faced
each
other
,
and
I
looked
straight
into
his
gray
,
bony
face
,
and
answered
in
a
tone
of
defiance
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
Governor
-
General
,
it
is
true
,
but
you
will
,
I
think
,
reflect
before
you
consign
me
,
an
Englishman
,
to
prison
without
trial
.
<EOS>
I
know
full
well
that
the
English
are
hated
by
Russia
,
yet
I
assure
you
that
in
London
we
entertain
no
love
for
your
nation
or
its
methods
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
laughed
,
"
you
are
quite
right
.
<EOS>
Russia
has
no
use
for
an
effete
ally
such
as
England
is
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Effete
or
powerful
,
my
country
is
still
able
to
present
an
ultimatum
when
diplomacy
requires
it
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Therefore
I
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
Send
me
to
prison
,
and
I
tell
you
that
the
responsibility
rests
upon
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
And
folding
my
arms
I
kept
my
eyes
intently
upon
his
,
so
that
he
should
not
see
that
I
wavered
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
for
the
responsibility
,
I
certainly
do
not
fear
that
,
m'sieur
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
exposure
that
will
result
--
are
you
prepared
to
face
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
others
beside
myself
--
one
other
,
indeed
,
who
is
a
diplomatist
--
is
aware
of
my
journey
here
?
<EOS>
If
I
do
not
return
,
your
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs
in
Petersburg
will
be
pressed
for
a
reason
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Which
they
will
not
give
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
if
they
do
not
,
the
truth
will
be
out
,
"
I
said
laughing
harshly
,
for
I
saw
how
determined
he
had
become
to
hold
me
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
call
up
your
myrmidon
and
send
me
to
Kajana
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
the
first
step
towards
your
own
downfall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
he
growled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
surely
do
not
think
that
I
,
after
ten
years
'
service
in
the
British
diplomatic
service
,
would
dare
to
come
to
Finland
upon
this
quest
--
would
dare
to
face
the
rotten
and
corrupt
officialdom
which
Russia
has
placed
within
this
country
--
without
first
taking
some
adequate
precaution
?
<EOS>
No
,
Baron
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
defy
you
,
and
I
leave
Helsingfors
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
.
<EOS>
You
are
under
arrest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
laughed
heartily
and
snapped
my
fingers
,
saying
:
 
"
Before
you
give
me
over
to
your
police
,
first
telegraph
to
your
Minister
of
Finance
,
Monsieur
de
Witte
,
and
inquire
of
him
who
and
what
I
am
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
merely
to
send
my
name
and
description
to
the
Minister
and
ask
for
a
reply
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
give
you
instructions
--
or
,
if
you
so
desire
,
ask
his
Majesty
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
why
,
pray
,
does
his
Majesty
concern
himself
about
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
at
once
puzzled
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
learn
later
,
after
I
am
confined
in
Kajana
and
your
secret
is
known
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
mean
that
I
have
taken
all
the
necessary
steps
to
be
forearmed
against
you
.
<EOS>
The
day
I
am
incarcerated
by
your
order
,
the
whole
truth
will
be
known
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
the
sufferer
--
but
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
words
,
purposely
enigmatical
,
misled
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
drift
of
my
argument
,
and
being
of
course
unaware
of
how
much
I
knew
,
he
was
still
in
fear
of
me
.
<EOS>
My
only
uncertainty
was
of
the
actual
fate
of
poor
Elma
.
<EOS>
My
wallet
had
been
stolen
--
with
a
purpose
,
without
a
doubt
--
for
the
thief
had
deprived
me
of
that
most
important
of
all
documents
,
the
open
sesame
to
every
closed
door
,
the
ukase
of
the
Czar
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
defy
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
hoarsely
,
turning
back
to
the
window
with
the
written
order
for
my
imprisonment
as
a
political
still
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
shall
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
rule
Finland
,
"
I
said
in
a
hard
tone
,
"
but
you
have
no
power
over
Gordon
Gregg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
power
,
and
intend
to
exert
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
your
own
ruin
,
"
I
remarked
with
a
self
-
confident
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
give
your
torturers
orders
to
kill
me
--
orders
that
a
fatal
accident
shall
occur
within
the
fortress
--
but
I
tell
you
frankly
that
my
death
will
neither
erase
nor
conceal
your
own
offenses
.
<EOS>
There
are
others
,
away
in
England
,
who
are
aware
of
them
,
and
who
will
,
in
order
to
avenge
my
death
,
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
although
Elma
Heath
has
been
deprived
of
both
hearing
and
of
speech
,
she
can
still
write
down
the
true
facts
in
black
and
white
.
<EOS>
The
Czar
may
be
your
patron
,
and
you
his
favorite
,
but
his
Majesty
has
no
tolerance
of
officials
who
are
guilty
of
what
you
are
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
You
talk
of
arresting
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
added
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
ought
rather
to
go
on
your
knees
and
beg
my
silence
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
went
white
with
rage
at
my
cutting
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
He
literally
boiled
over
,
for
he
saw
that
I
was
quite
cool
and
had
no
fear
of
him
or
of
the
terrible
punishment
to
which
he
intended
to
consign
me
.
<EOS>
Besides
which
,
he
was
filled
with
wonder
regarding
the
exact
amount
of
information
which
Elma
had
imparted
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
certain
persons
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
to
whom
it
would
be
of
intense
interest
to
know
the
true
reason
why
the
steam
-
yacht
_
Lola
_
put
into
Leghorn
;
why
I
was
entertained
on
board
her
;
why
the
safe
in
the
British
Consulate
was
rifled
,
and
why
the
unfortunate
girl
,
kept
a
prisoner
on
board
,
was
taken
on
shore
just
before
the
hurried
sailing
of
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
And
there
are
other
mysteries
which
the
English
police
are
trying
to
solve
,
namely
,
the
reason
Armida
Santini
and
a
man
disguised
as
her
husband
died
in
Scotland
at
the
hand
of
an
assassin
.
<EOS>
But
surely
I
need
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
It
is
surely
sufficient
to
convince
you
that
if
the
truth
were
spoken
,
the
revelations
would
be
distinctly
awkward
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
whom
?
"
he
asked
,
opening
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
you
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Baron
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
can
we
not
yet
speak
frankly
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
a
fact
which
was
in
itself
proof
that
my
pointed
argument
had
caused
him
to
reconsider
his
intention
of
sending
me
under
escort
back
to
that
castle
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
If
my
journey
there
was
in
order
to
meet
my
love
,
I
would
not
have
cared
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
ignorance
of
her
whereabouts
or
of
her
fate
that
held
me
in
such
deep
,
all
-
consuming
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Each
hour
that
passed
increased
my
fond
and
tender
affection
for
her
.
<EOS>
And
yet
what
irony
of
circumstance
!
<EOS>
She
had
been
cruelly
snatched
from
me
at
the
very
moment
that
freedom
had
been
ours
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
well
that
I
assumed
that
air
of
defiance
with
the
man
who
had
ground
Finland
beneath
his
heel
.
<EOS>
He
was
unused
to
it
.
<EOS>
No
one
dared
to
go
against
his
will
,
or
to
utter
taunt
or
threat
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
paramount
,
with
all
the
powers
of
an
emperor
--
the
power
,
indeed
,
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
being
either
thwarted
or
criticised
,
and
I
could
see
that
my
words
had
aroused
within
him
a
boiling
tumult
of
resentment
and
of
rage
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
nothing
of
the
loss
of
my
wallet
or
of
the
precious
document
that
it
had
contained
.
<EOS>
My
defiance
was
merely
upon
principle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Arrest
me
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
Denounce
me
by
means
of
any
lie
that
arises
to
your
lips
,
but
remember
that
the
truth
is
known
beyond
the
confines
of
the
Russian
Empire
,
and
for
that
reason
traces
will
be
sought
of
me
and
full
explanation
demanded
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
precaution
,
Xavier
Oberg
,
<EOS>
"
I
added
,
"
therefore
do
your
worst
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
again
that
I
defy
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
paced
the
big
room
,
his
thin
claw
-
like
hands
still
clenched
,
his
yellow
teeth
grinding
,
his
dark
,
deep
-
set
eyes
fixed
straight
before
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
dared
,
he
would
have
struck
me
down
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
dare
.
<EOS>
I
saw
too
plainly
that
even
though
my
wallet
was
gone
I
still
held
the
trump
-
card
--
that
he
feared
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
mention
I
had
made
of
the
Minister
of
Finance
,
however
,
seemed
to
cause
him
considerable
hesitation
.
<EOS>
That
high
official
had
the
ear
of
the
Emperor
,
and
if
I
were
a
friend
there
might
be
inquiries
.
<EOS>
As
I
stood
before
him
leaning
against
a
small
buhl
table
,
I
watched
all
the
complex
workings
of
his
mind
,
and
tried
to
read
the
mysterious
motive
which
had
caused
him
to
consign
poor
Elma
to
Kajana
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
proud
bully
,
possessing
neither
pity
nor
remorse
,
an
average
specimen
of
the
high
Russian
official
,
a
hide
-
bound
bureaucrat
,
a
slave
to
etiquette
and
possessing
a
veneer
of
polish
.
<EOS>
But
beneath
it
all
I
saw
that
he
was
a
coward
in
deadly
fear
of
assassination
--
a
coward
who
dreaded
lest
some
secret
should
be
revealed
.
<EOS>
That
concealed
door
in
the
paneling
with
the
armed
guard
lurking
behind
was
sufficiently
plain
evidence
that
he
was
not
the
fearless
Governor
-
General
that
was
popularly
supposed
.
<EOS>
He
,
"
The
Strangler
of
Finland
,
"
had
crushed
the
gallant
nation
into
submission
,
ruining
their
commerce
,
sapping
the
country
by
impressing
its
youth
into
the
Russian
army
,
forbidding
the
use
of
the
Finnish
language
,
and
taxing
the
people
until
the
factories
had
been
compelled
to
close
down
while
the
peasantry
starved
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
on
the
verge
of
revolt
,
there
had
arisen
a
band
of
patriots
who
resented
ruin
,
and
who
had
already
warned
his
Majesty
by
letter
that
if
Baron
Oberg
were
not
removed
from
his
post
he
would
die
.
 
<EOS>
These
and
other
thoughts
ran
through
my
mind
in
the
silence
that
followed
our
heated
argument
,
for
I
saw
well
that
he
was
in
actual
fear
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
led
him
to
believe
that
I
knew
everything
,
and
that
his
future
was
in
my
hands
,
while
he
,
on
his
part
,
was
anxious
to
hold
me
prisoner
,
and
yet
dared
not
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
My
wallet
had
probably
been
stolen
by
some
lurking
police
-
spy
,
for
Russian
agents
abound
everywhere
in
Finland
,
reporting
conspiracies
that
do
not
exist
and
denouncing
the
innocent
as
"
politicals
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Baron
had
halted
,
and
was
looking
through
one
of
the
great
windows
down
upon
the
courtyard
below
where
the
sentries
were
pacing
.
<EOS>
The
palace
was
for
him
a
gilded
prison
,
for
he
dared
not
go
out
for
a
drive
in
one
or
other
of
the
parks
or
for
a
blow
on
the
water
across
to
Hogholmen
or
Dagero
,
being
compelled
to
remain
there
for
months
without
showing
himself
publicly
.
<EOS>
People
in
Abo
had
told
me
that
when
he
did
go
out
into
the
streets
of
Helsingfors
<EOS>
it
was
at
night
,
and
he
usually
disguised
himself
in
the
uniform
of
a
private
soldier
of
the
guard
,
thus
escaping
recognition
by
those
who
,
driven
to
desperation
by
injustice
,
sought
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
A
long
silence
had
fallen
between
us
,
and
it
now
occurred
to
me
to
take
advantage
of
his
hesitation
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
said
in
a
firm
voice
,
in
French--
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Baron
,
our
interview
is
at
an
end
,
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
Therefore
I
wish
you
good
-
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
turned
upon
me
suddenly
with
an
evil
flash
in
his
dark
eyes
,
and
a
snarling
imprecation
in
Russian
upon
his
lips
.
<EOS>
His
hand
still
held
the
order
committing
me
to
the
fortress
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
before
I
leave
you
will
destroy
that
document
.
<EOS>
It
may
fall
into
other
hands
,
you
know
,
"
and
I
walked
towards
him
with
quick
determination
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
!
"
<EOS>
he
snapped
.
 
<EOS>
Without
further
word
I
snatched
the
paper
from
his
thin
white
fingers
and
tore
it
up
before
his
face
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
went
livid
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
have
ever
seen
a
man
's
face
assume
such
an
expression
of
fiendish
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
though
at
that
instant
hell
had
been
let
loose
within
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
turned
upon
my
heel
and
went
out
,
passing
the
sentries
in
the
ante
-
room
,
along
the
flower
-
filled
corridors
and
across
the
courtyard
to
the
main
entrance
where
the
gorgeous
concierge
saluted
me
as
I
stepped
forth
into
the
square
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
escaped
by
means
of
my
own
diplomacy
and
firmness
.
<EOS>
The
Czar
's
representative
--
the
man
who
ruled
that
country
--
feared
me
,
and
for
that
reason
did
not
hold
me
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Yet
when
I
recalled
that
evil
look
of
revenge
on
my
departure
,
I
could
not
help
certain
feelings
of
grave
apprehension
arising
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
Returning
to
my
hotel
,
I
smoked
a
cigar
in
my
room
and
pondered
.
<EOS>
Where
was
Elma
?
<EOS>
was
the
chief
question
which
arose
within
my
mind
.
<EOS>
By
remaining
in
Helsingfors
I
could
achieve
nothing
further
,
now
that
I
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
oppressor
,
whereas
if
I
returned
to
Abo
<EOS>
I
might
perchance
be
able
to
obtain
some
clue
to
my
love
's
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
I
call
her
my
love
because
I
both
pitied
and
loved
the
poor
afflicted
girl
who
was
so
helpless
and
defenseless
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
took
the
midnight
train
back
to
Abo
,
arriving
at
the
hotel
next
morning
.
<EOS>
After
an
hour
's
rest
I
set
out
anxiously
in
search
of
Felix
,
the
drosky
-
driver
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
in
his
log
-
built
house
in
the
Ludno
quarter
,
and
when
he
asked
me
in
<EOS>
I
saw
,
from
his
face
,
that
he
had
news
to
impart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
I
inquired
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
of
the
lady
?
<EOS>
Has
she
been
found
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
your
Excellency
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
you
were
not
here
yesterday
,
"
he
said
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
quickly
.
<EOS>
What
has
happened
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
assisting
the
police
as
spy
,
Excellency
,
as
I
often
do
,
and
I
have
seen
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Seen
her
!
<EOS>
Where
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
in
quick
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
in
Abo
.
<EOS>
She
arrived
yesterday
morning
from
Tammerfors
accompanied
by
an
Englishman
.
<EOS>
She
had
changed
her
dress
,
and
was
all
in
black
.
<EOS>
They
lunched
together
at
the
Restaurant
du
Nord
opposite
the
landing
stage
,
and
an
hour
later
left
by
steamer
for
Petersburg
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
Englishman
!
"
<EOS>
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
inform
the
Chief
of
Police
,
Boranski
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
your
Excellency
.
<EOS>
But
he
said
that
their
passports
being
in
order
it
was
better
to
allow
the
lady
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
To
delay
her
might
mean
her
rearrest
in
Finland
,
"
he
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
their
passports
were
vised
here
on
embarking
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
What
was
the
name
upon
that
of
the
Englishman
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
here
written
down
,
Excellency
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
pronounce
your
difficult
English
names
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
produced
a
scrap
of
dirty
paper
whereon
was
written
in
a
Russian
hand
the
name--
 
"
Martin
Woodroffe
.
"
    
CHAPTER
XIII
 
A
DOUBLE
GAME
AND
ITS
CONSEQUENCES
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
railway
station
,
and
from
the
time
-
table
gathered
that
if
I
left
Abo
by
rail
at
noon
I
could
be
in
Petersburg
an
hour
before
noon
on
the
morrow
,
or
about
four
hours
before
the
arrival
of
the
steamer
by
which
the
silent
girl
and
her
companion
were
passengers
.
<EOS>
This
I
decided
upon
doing
,
but
before
leaving
I
paid
a
visit
to
my
friend
,
Boranski
,
who
,
to
my
surprise
and
delight
,
handed
me
my
wallet
with
the
Czar
's
letter
intact
,
saying
that
it
had
been
found
upon
a
German
thief
who
had
been
arrested
at
the
harbor
on
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
had
,
no
doubt
,
stolen
it
from
my
pocket
believing
<EOS>
I
carried
my
paper
money
in
the
flap
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
affair
of
the
English
lady
is
a
most
extraordinary
one
,
"
remarked
the
Chief
of
Police
,
toying
with
his
pen
as
he
sat
at
his
big
table
.
<EOS>
"
She
seems
to
have
met
this
Englishman
up
at
Tammerfors
,
or
at
some
place
further
north
,
yet
it
is
curious
that
her
passport
should
be
in
order
even
though
she
fled
so
precipitately
from
Kajana
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
mystery
connected
with
her
disappearance
from
the
wood
-
cutter
's
hut
that
I
confess
I
can
not
fathom
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
can
I
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
man
who
is
with
her
,
and
can
not
help
fearing
that
he
is
her
bitterest
enemy
--
that
he
is
acting
in
concert
with
the
Baron
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
why
is
he
taking
her
to
the
capital
--
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Governor
-
General
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
straight
to
Petersburg
to
ascertain
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
come
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
Truth
to
tell
<EOS>
,
I
have
been
somewhat
surprised
that
you
should
have
interested
yourself
on
my
behalf
,
"
I
added
,
looking
straight
at
the
uniformed
official
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
on
yours
,
but
on
hers
,
"
he
answered
,
somewhat
enigmatically
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
something
of
the
affair
,
but
it
was
my
duty
as
a
man
to
help
the
poor
girl
to
escape
from
that
terrible
place
.
<EOS>
She
has
,
I
know
,
been
unjustly
condemned
for
the
attempted
assassination
of
the
wife
of
a
General
--
condemned
with
a
purpose
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Such
a
thing
is
not
unusual
in
Finland
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Abominable
!
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Oberg
is
a
veritable
fiend
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
man
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
The
orders
of
his
Excellency
the
Governor
-
General
have
to
be
obeyed
,
whatever
they
are
.
<EOS>
We
often
regret
,
but
we
dare
not
refuse
to
carry
them
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Russian
rule
is
a
disgrace
to
our
modern
civilization
,
"
I
declared
hotly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
every
sympathy
with
those
who
are
fighting
for
freedom
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
are
not
alone
in
that
,
"
he
sighed
,
speaking
in
a
low
whisper
,
and
glancing
around
.
"
<EOS>
His
Majesty
would
order
reforms
and
ameliorate
the
condition
of
his
people
,
if
only
it
were
possible
.
<EOS>
But
he
,
like
his
officials
,
are
powerless
.
<EOS>
Here
we
speak
of
the
great
uprising
with
bated
breath
,
but
we
,
alas
!
<EOS>
know
that
it
must
come
one
day
--
very
soon
--
and
Finland
will
be
the
first
to
endeavor
to
break
her
bonds
--
and
the
Baron
Oberg
the
first
to
fall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
For
nearly
an
hour
I
sat
with
him
,
surprised
to
find
how
,
although
his
exterior
was
so
harsh
and
uncouth
,
yet
his
heart
really
bled
for
the
poor
starving
people
he
was
so
constantly
forced
to
oppress
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
ruined
this
town
of
Abo
,
"
he
declared
,
quite
frankly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
my
own
knowledge
five
hundred
innocent
persons
have
gone
to
prison
,
and
another
two
hundred
have
been
exiled
to
Siberia
.
<EOS>
Yet
what
I
have
done
is
only
at
direct
orders
from
Helsingfors
--
orders
that
are
stern
,
pitiless
and
unjust
.
<EOS>
Men
have
been
torn
from
their
families
and
sent
to
the
mines
,
women
have
been
arrested
for
no
offense
and
shipped
off
to
Saghalien
,
and
mere
children
have
been
cast
into
prison
on
charges
of
political
conspiracy
with
their
elders
--
in
order
to
Russify
the
province
!
<EOS>
Only
,
"
he
added
anxiously
,
"
I
trust
you
will
never
repeat
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
asked
me
why
I
assisted
the
English
Mademoiselle
to
escape
from
Kajana
,
and
I
have
explained
the
reason
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
ate
a
hearty
meal
in
company
at
the
_
Sampalinna
_
,
a
restaurant
built
like
a
Swiss
chalet
,
and
at
noon
I
entered
the
train
on
the
first
stage
of
my
slow
,
tedious
journey
through
the
great
silent
forests
and
along
the
shores
of
the
lakes
of
Southern
Finland
,
by
way
of
Tavestehus
and
Viborg
,
to
Petersburg
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
alone
in
the
compartment
,
and
sat
moodily
watching
the
panorama
of
wood
and
river
as
we
slowly
wound
up
the
tortuous
ascents
and
descended
the
steep
gradients
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
even
a
newspaper
with
which
to
while
away
the
time
,
only
my
own
apprehensive
thoughts
of
whither
my
helpless
love
was
being
conducted
.
  
<EOS>
Surely
to
no
man
was
there
ever
presented
such
a
complicated
problem
as
that
which
I
was
now
trying
so
vigorously
to
solve
.
<EOS>
I
loved
Elma
Heath
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
reflected
,
the
deeper
did
her
sweet
countenance
and
tender
grace
impress
themselves
upon
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
loved
her
,
therefore
I
was
striving
to
overtake
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
steamer
,
I
learned
,
would
call
at
Hango
and
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
Would
they
,
I
wonder
,
disembark
at
either
of
those
places
?
<EOS>
Was
the
man
whom
I
had
known
as
Hornby
,
the
owner
of
the
_
Lola
_
,
taking
her
to
place
her
again
in
the
fiendish
hands
of
Xavier
Oberg
?
<EOS>
The
very
thought
of
it
caused
me
to
hold
my
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Daylight
came
at
last
,
cold
and
gray
,
over
those
dreary
interminable
marshes
where
game
,
especially
snipe
,
seemed
abundant
,
and
at
a
small
station
at
the
head
of
a
lake
called
Davidstadt
<EOS>
I
took
my
morning
glass
of
tea
;
then
we
resumed
our
journey
down
to
Viborg
,
where
a
short
,
thick
-
set
Russian
of
the
commercial
class
,
but
something
of
a
dandy
,
entered
my
compartment
,
and
we
left
express
for
Petersburg
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
passed
by
a
small
station
called
Galitsina
,
near
which
were
many
villas
occupied
in
summer
by
families
from
Petersburg
,
and
were
traveling
through
the
dense
gloomy
pine
-
woods
,
when
my
fellow
-
traveler
,
having
asked
permission
to
smoke
,
commenced
to
chat
affably
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
a
pleasant
fellow
,
and
told
me
that
he
was
a
wool
merchant
,
and
that
he
had
been
having
a
pleasant
vacation
trout
fishing
in
the
Vuoski
above
the
falls
of
the
Imatra
,
where
the
pools
between
the
rapids
abound
with
fish
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
told
me
that
on
account
of
the
shore
being
so
full
of
weeds
and
the
clearness
of
the
water
,
fishing
from
the
banks
was
almost
an
impossibility
,
and
how
they
had
to
accustom
themselves
to
troll
from
a
boat
so
small
as
to
only
accommodate
the
rower
and
the
fisherman
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
remarked
suddenly--
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
English
,
I
presume
--
possibly
from
Helsingfors
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
From
Abo
.
<EOS>
I
crossed
from
Stockholm
,
and
am
going
to
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
also
.
<EOS>
I
live
in
Petersburg
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
perhaps
meet
one
day
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
the
capital
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
explained
that
I
had
visited
it
once
before
,
and
had
done
the
usual
round
of
sight
-
seeing
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
brisk
and
to
the
point
,
as
became
a
man
of
business
,
but
when
we
stopped
at
Bele
-
Ostrof
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
small
winding
river
that
separates
Finland
from
Russia
proper
,
the
Customs
officer
who
came
to
examine
our
baggage
exchanged
a
curious
meaning
look
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
fellow
-
traveler
believed
that
I
had
not
observed
,
yet
,
keenly
on
the
alert
as
I
now
was
,
I
was
shrewd
to
detect
the
least
sign
or
look
,
and
I
at
once
resolved
to
tell
the
fellow
nothing
further
of
my
own
affairs
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
no
doubt
,
a
spy
of
"
The
Strangler
's
,
"
who
had
followed
me
all
the
way
from
Abo
,
and
had
only
entered
my
carriage
for
the
final
stage
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
This
revelation
caused
me
some
uneasiness
,
for
even
though
I
was
able
to
evade
the
man
on
arrival
in
Petersburg
,
he
could
no
doubt
quickly
obtain
news
of
my
whereabouts
from
the
police
to
whom
my
passport
must
be
sent
.
<EOS>
I
pretended
to
doze
,
and
lay
back
with
my
eyes
half
-
closed
watching
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
found
me
disinclined
to
talk
further
,
he
took
up
the
paper
he
had
bought
and
<EOS>
became
engrossed
in
it
,
while
I
,
on
my
part
,
endeavored
to
form
some
plan
by
which
to
mislead
and
escape
his
vigilance
.
 
<EOS>
The
fellow
meant
mischief
--
that
I
knew
.
<EOS>
If
Elma
was
flying
in
secret
and
he
watched
me
,
he
would
know
that
she
was
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
At
all
hazards
,
for
my
love
's
sake
as
well
as
for
mine
,
I
saw
that
I
must
escape
him
.
<EOS>
The
ingeniousness
and
cleverness
of
Oberg
's
spies
was
proverbial
throughout
Finland
,
therefore
he
might
not
be
alone
,
or
in
any
case
,
on
arrival
in
Petersburg
would
obtain
assistance
in
keeping
observation
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
the
Baron
desired
my
death
,
and
that
therefore
I
could
not
be
too
wary
of
pitfalls
.
<EOS>
That
fatal
chair
so
cunningly
prepared
for
me
in
Lambeth
was
still
vividly
within
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
passed
Lanskaya
,
and
ran
through
the
outer
suburbs
of
Petersburg
,
my
fellow
-
traveler
became
inquisitive
as
to
where
I
was
going
,
but
I
was
somewhat
unresponsive
,
and
busied
myself
with
my
bag
until
we
entered
the
great
echoing
<EOS>
terminus
whence
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
Neva
gleaming
in
the
pale
sunlight
and
the
city
beyond
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
made
no
attempt
to
follow
me
--
he
was
too
clever
a
secret
agent
for
that
.
<EOS>
He
merely
wished
me
"
_
sdravstvuite
_
"
raised
his
hat
politely
and
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
A
porter
carried
my
bag
out
of
the
station
,
and
I
drove
across
the
bridge
to
the
large
hotel
where
I
had
stopped
before
,
the
Europe
,
on
the
corner
of
the
Nevski
Prospect
and
the
Michael
Street
.
<EOS>
There
I
engaged
a
front
room
looking
down
into
the
broad
Nevski
,
had
a
wash
,
and
then
watched
at
the
window
for
the
appearance
of
the
spy
.
<EOS>
I
had
already
a
good
four
hours
before
the
steamer
from
Abo
was
due
,
and
I
intended
to
satisfy
myself
whether
or
not
I
was
being
followed
.
 
<EOS>
Within
twenty
minutes
the
fellow
lounged
along
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
,
just
as
I
had
expected
.
<EOS>
He
had
changed
his
clothes
,
and
presented
such
a
different
appearance
that
at
first
sight
I
failed
to
recognize
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
I
had
driven
there
,
and
intended
to
follow
me
if
I
came
forth
.
<EOS>
My
position
was
one
of
extreme
difficulty
,
for
if
I
went
down
to
the
quay
he
would
most
certainly
follow
me
.
 
<EOS>
Having
watched
his
movements
for
ten
minutes
or
<EOS>
so
I
descended
to
the
big
_
salle
-
a
-
manger
_
and
there
ate
my
luncheon
,
chatting
to
the
French
waiter
the
while
.
<EOS>
I
sat
purposely
in
an
alcove
,
so
as
to
be
away
from
the
other
people
lunching
there
,
and
in
order
that
I
might
be
able
to
talk
with
the
waiter
without
being
overheard
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
I
had
finished
my
meal
,
and
he
was
handing
me
my
bill
,
I
bent
towards
him
and
asked--
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
earn
twenty
roubles
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
m'sieur
,
"
he
answered
,
looking
at
me
with
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
be
acceptable
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
want
to
escape
from
this
place
without
being
observed
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
disagreeable
little
matter
regarding
a
lady
,
and
I
fear
a
fracas
with
a
man
who
is
awaiting
me
outside
in
the
Nevski
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
seeing
that
he
hesitated
,
I
assured
him
that
I
had
committed
no
crime
,
and
that
I
should
return
for
my
baggage
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
could
pass
through
the
kitchen
and
out
by
the
servants
'
entrance
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
m'sieur
so
desires
,
I
will
conduct
him
out
.
<EOS>
The
exit
is
in
a
back
street
which
leads
on
to
the
Catherine
Canal
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Excellent
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
say
nothing
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
,
m'sieur
,
"
and
he
gathered
up
the
notes
plus
twenty
roubles
with
which
I
paid
my
bill
,
and
taking
my
hat
<EOS>
I
followed
him
to
the
end
of
the
_
salle
-
a
-
manger
_
behind
a
high
wooden
screen
,
across
the
huge
kitchen
,
and
then
through
a
long
stone
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
sat
a
gruff
old
doorkeeper
.
<EOS>
My
guide
spoke
a
word
to
him
,
and
then
the
door
opened
and
I
found
myself
in
a
narrow
back
slum
with
the
canal
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
My
first
visit
was
to
a
clothier
's
,
where
I
purchased
and
put
on
a
new
light
overcoat
and
then
to
a
hatter
's
for
a
hat
of
different
shape
to
that
I
was
wearing
.
<EOS>
I
carried
the
hat
back
to
a
quiet
alley
which
I
had
noticed
,
and
quickly
exchanged
the
one
I
was
wearing
for
it
,
leaving
my
old
hat
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
Then
I
entered
a
_
cafe
_
in
order
to
while
away
the
hours
until
the
vessel
from
Finland
was
due
.
 
<EOS>
At
four
o'clock
I
was
out
upon
the
quay
,
straining
my
eyes
seaward
for
any
sign
of
smoke
,
but
could
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
sinking
,
and
the
broad
expanse
of
water
westward
danced
like
liquid
gold
.
<EOS>
The
light
died
out
slowly
,
the
cold
gray
of
evening
crept
on
.
<EOS>
A
chill
wind
sprang
up
and
swept
the
quay
,
causing
me
to
shiver
.
<EOS>
I
asked
of
a
dock
laborer
whether
the
steamer
was
usually
late
,
whereupon
he
told
me
that
it
was
often
five
or
six
hours
behind
time
,
depending
upon
the
delay
at
Helsingfors
.
 
<EOS>
Twilight
deepened
into
night
,
and
the
rain
fell
heavily
,
yet
I
still
paced
the
wet
flags
in
patience
,
<EOS>
my
eyes
ever
seaward
for
the
light
of
the
vessel
which
I
hoped
bore
my
love
.
<EOS>
My
presence
there
aroused
some
speculation
among
the
loungers
,
I
think
;
nevertheless
,
I
waited
in
deepest
anxiety
whether
,
after
all
,
Elma
and
Hornby
had
not
disembarked
at
Helsingfors
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
ten
o'clock
a
light
shone
afar
off
,
and
the
movement
of
the
police
and
porters
on
the
quay
told
me
that
it
was
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
Then
after
a
further
anxious
quarter
of
an
hour
it
came
,
amid
great
shouting
and
mutual
imprecations
,
slowly
alongside
the
quay
,
and
the
passengers
at
last
began
to
disembark
in
the
pelting
rain
.
 
<EOS>
One
after
another
they
walked
up
the
gangway
,
filing
into
the
passport
-
office
and
on
into
the
Custom
House
,
people
of
all
sorts
and
all
grades
--
Swedes
,
Germans
,
Finns
,
and
Russians
--
<EOS>
until
suddenly
I
caught
sight
of
two
figures
--
one
a
man
in
a
big
tweed
traveling
-
coat
and
a
golf
-
cap
,
and
the
other
the
slight
figure
of
a
woman
in
a
long
dark
cloak
and
a
woolen
tam
-
o'-shanter
.
<EOS>
The
electric
rays
fell
upon
them
as
they
came
up
the
wet
gangway
together
,
and
there
once
again
I
saw
the
sweet
face
of
the
silent
woman
whom
I
had
grown
to
love
with
such
fervent
desperation
.
<EOS>
The
man
behind
her
was
the
same
who
had
entertained
me
on
board
the
_
Lola_--the
man
who
was
said
to
be
the
lover
of
the
fugitive
Muriel
Leithcourt
.
 
<EOS>
Without
betraying
my
presence
I
watched
them
pass
through
the
passport
-
office
and
Custom
House
,
and
then
,
overhearing
the
address
which
Martin
Woodroffe
gave
the
_
isvoshtchik
_
<EOS>
,
I
stood
aside
,
wet
to
the
skin
,
and
saw
them
drive
away
.
 
<EOS>
At
eleven
o'clock
on
the
following
day
I
found
myself
installed
in
the
Hotel
de
Paris
,
a
comfortable
hostelry
in
the
Little
Morskaya
,
having
succeeded
in
evading
the
vigilance
of
the
spy
who
had
so
cleverly
followed
me
from
Abo
,
and
in
getting
my
suit
-
case
round
from
the
Hotel
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
beneath
the
same
roof
as
Elma
,
although
she
was
in
ignorance
of
my
presence
.
<EOS>
Anxious
to
communicate
with
her
without
Woodroffe
's
knowledge
,
I
was
now
awaiting
my
opportunity
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
it
appeared
,
taken
for
her
a
pleasant
front
room
with
sitting
-
room
adjoining
on
the
first
floor
,
while
he
himself
occupied
a
room
on
the
third
floor
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
he
had
engaged
for
her
were
the
most
expensive
in
the
hotel
,
and
as
far
as
I
could
gather
from
the
French
waiter
whom
I
judiciously
tipped
,
he
appeared
to
treat
her
with
every
consideration
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
poor
young
lady
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
man
exclaimed
as
he
stood
in
my
room
answering
my
questions
,
"
What
an
affliction
!
<EOS>
She
writes
down
all
her
orders
--
for
she
can
utter
no
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
the
Englishman
received
any
visitors
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
man
--
a
Russian
--
an
official
of
police
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
receives
anyone
else
,
let
me
know
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
want
you
to
give
Mademoiselle
a
letter
from
me
in
secret
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bien
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
turned
to
the
little
writing
-
table
and
scribbled
a
few
hasty
lines
to
my
love
,
announcing
my
presence
,
and
asking
her
to
grant
me
an
interview
in
secret
as
soon
as
Woodroffe
was
absent
.
<EOS>
I
also
warned
her
of
the
search
for
her
instigated
by
the
Baron
,
and
urged
her
to
send
me
a
line
in
reply
.
 
<EOS>
The
note
was
delivered
into
her
hand
,
but
although
I
waited
in
suspense
nearly
all
day
she
sent
no
reply
.
<EOS>
While
Woodroffe
was
in
the
hotel
I
dared
not
show
myself
lest
he
should
recognize
me
,
therefore
I
was
compelled
to
sham
indisposition
and
to
eat
my
meals
alone
in
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
Both
the
means
by
which
she
had
met
Martin
Woodroffe
and
the
motive
were
equally
an
enigma
.
<EOS>
By
that
letter
she
had
written
to
her
schoolfellow
<EOS>
it
was
apparent
that
she
had
some
secret
of
his
,
<EOS>
for
had
she
not
wished
to
send
him
a
message
of
reassurance
that
she
had
divulged
nothing
?
<EOS>
This
would
seem
that
they
were
close
friends
;
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
something
seemed
to
tell
me
that
he
was
acting
falsely
,
and
was
really
an
ally
of
the
Baron
's
.
 
<EOS>
Why
had
he
brought
her
to
Petersburg
?
<EOS>
If
he
had
desired
to
rescue
her
he
would
have
taken
her
in
the
opposite
direction
--
to
Stockholm
,
where
she
would
be
free
--
whereas
he
took
her
,
an
escaped
prisoner
,
into
the
very
midst
of
peril
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
her
passport
was
in
order
,
yet
I
remembered
that
an
order
had
been
issued
for
her
transportation
to
Saghalien
,
and
now
once
arrested
she
must
be
lost
to
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
This
thought
filled
me
with
fierce
anxiety
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
Petersburg
,
that
city
where
police
spies
swarm
,
and
where
every
fresh
arrival
is
noted
and
his
antecedents
inquired
into
.
<EOS>
No
attempt
had
been
made
to
disguise
who
she
was
,
therefore
before
long
the
police
would
undoubtedly
come
and
arrest
her
as
the
escaped
criminal
from
Kajana
.
 
<EOS>
For
several
hours
I
sat
at
my
window
watching
the
life
and
movement
down
in
the
street
below
,
my
mind
full
of
wonder
and
dark
forebodings
.
<EOS>
Was
Martin
Woodroffe
playing
her
false
?
 
<EOS>
Just
after
half
-
past
six
o'clock
the
waiter
entered
,
and
handing
me
a
note
on
a
salver
,
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
has
,
I
believe
,
only
this
moment
been
able
to
write
in
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tore
it
open
and
read
as
follows:--
 
DEAR
FRIEND.--_I
am
so
surprised
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
still
in
Abo
.
<EOS>
Woodroffe
has
an
appointment
at
eight
o'clock
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
,
therefore
come
to
me
at
8.15
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
you
,
and
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
peril_.--ELMA
HEATH
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
was
in
peril
!
<EOS>
It
was
just
as
I
had
feared
.
<EOS>
I
thanked
Providence
that
I
had
been
sent
to
help
her
and
extricate
her
from
that
awful
fate
to
which
"
The
Strangler
of
Finland
"
had
consigned
her
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
hour
she
named
,
after
the
waiter
had
come
to
me
and
announced
the
Englishman
's
departure
<EOS>
,
I
descended
to
her
sitting
-
room
and
entered
without
rapping
,
for
if
I
had
rapped
she
could
not
,
alas
!
<EOS>
have
heard
.
 
<EOS>
The
apartment
was
spacious
and
comfortable
,
thickly
carpeted
,
with
heavy
furniture
and
gilding
.
<EOS>
Before
the
long
window
were
drawn
curtains
of
dark
green
plush
,
and
on
one
side
was
the
high
stove
of
white
porcelain
with
shining
brass
bands
,
while
from
her
low
lounge
-
chair
a
slim
wan
figure
sprang
up
quickly
and
came
forward
to
greet
me
,
holding
out
both
her
hands
and
smiling
happily
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
her
hands
in
mine
and
held
them
tightly
in
silence
for
some
moments
,
as
I
looked
earnestly
into
those
wonderfully
brilliant
eyes
of
hers
.
<EOS>
She
turned
away
laughing
,
a
slight
flush
rising
to
her
cheeks
in
her
confusion
.
<EOS>
Then
she
led
me
to
a
chair
,
and
motioned
me
to
be
seated
.
 
<EOS>
Ours
was
a
silent
meeting
,
but
her
gestures
and
the
expression
of
her
eyes
were
surely
more
eloquent
than
mere
words
.
<EOS>
I
knew
well
what
pleasure
that
re
-
encounter
caused
her
--
equal
pleasure
with
that
it
gave
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Until
that
moment
I
had
never
really
loved
.
<EOS>
I
had
admired
and
flirted
with
women
.
<EOS>
What
man
has
not
?
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
had
admired
Muriel
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
But
never
until
now
had
I
experienced
in
my
heart
the
real
flame
of
true
burning
affection
.
<EOS>
The
sweetness
of
her
expression
,
the
tender
caress
of
those
soft
,
tapering
hands
,
the
deep
mysterious
look
in
those
magnificent
eyes
,
and
the
incomparable
grace
of
all
her
movements
,
combined
to
render
her
the
most
perfect
woman
I
had
ever
met
--
perfect
in
all
,
alas
!
<EOS>
save
speech
and
hearing
,
of
which
,
with
such
dastard
wantonness
,
she
had
been
deprived
.
 
<EOS>
She
touched
her
red
lips
with
the
tip
of
her
forefinger
,
opened
her
hands
,
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
sad
gesture
of
regret
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
quickly
to
some
paper
on
the
little
table
at
her
side
she
wrote
something
with
a
gold
pencil
and
handed
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
read--
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
Providence
has
sent
you
here
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Woodroffe
must
have
followed
you
from
England
.
<EOS>
He
is
my
enemy
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
me
from
here
and
hide
me
.
<EOS>
They
intend
to
send
me
into
exile
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
been
in
Petersburg
before
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
anyone
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
when
I
had
read
,
she
handed
me
her
pencil
and
below
I
<EOS>
wrote--
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
best
,
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
once
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
But
is
it
not
best
that
we
should
escape
at
once
from
Russia
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
at
present
,
"
she
wrote
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
both
be
arrested
at
the
frontier
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
best
to
go
into
hiding
here
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
I
believed
Woodroffe
to
be
my
friend
,
but
I
have
found
only
this
day
that
he
is
my
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
I
was
in
Kajana
,
and
was
in
Abo
when
he
learned
of
my
escape
.
<EOS>
He
went
with
two
other
men
in
search
of
us
,
and
discovered
us
that
night
when
we
sought
shelter
at
the
wood
-
cutter
's
hut
.
<EOS>
Without
making
his
presence
known
he
waited
outside
until
you
were
asleep
,
and
then
he
came
and
looked
in
at
my
window
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
was
alarmed
,
but
quickly
I
saw
that
he
was
a
friend
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
the
police
were
in
the
vicinity
and
intended
to
raid
the
hut
,
therefore
I
fled
with
him
,
first
down
to
Tammerfors
and
then
to
Abo
,
and
on
here
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
I
did
not
see
the
dastardly
trap
he
had
laid
in
order
to
get
me
out
of
the
Baron
's
clutches
and
wring
from
me
my
secret
.
<EOS>
If
I
confess
,
he
intends
to
give
me
up
to
the
police
,
who
will
send
me
to
the
mines
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Does
your
secret
concern
him
?
"
I
asked
in
writing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
wrote
in
response
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
equally
in
his
interests
as
well
as
those
of
Baron
Oberg
if
I
were
sent
to
Saghalien
and
my
identity
effaced
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
Russian
subject
,
as
I
have
already
told
you
,
therefore
with
a
Ministerial
order
against
me
I
am
in
deadliest
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Trust
in
me
,
"
I
scribbled
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
act
upon
any
suggestion
you
make
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
female
friend
in
whom
you
could
trust
to
hide
you
until
this
danger
is
past
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
friend
--
a
true
friend
.
<EOS>
Will
you
take
a
note
to
her
?
<EOS>
"
she
wrote
,
to
which
I
instantly
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
Then
rising
,
she
obtained
some
ink
and
pen
and
wrote
a
letter
,
the
contents
of
which
she
did
not
show
me
before
she
sealed
it
.
<EOS>
I
sat
watching
her
beautiful
head
bent
beneath
the
shaded
lamplight
,
catching
her
profile
and
noticing
how
eminently
handsome
it
was
,
superb
and
unblemished
in
her
youthful
womanhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
watched
her
write
the
superscription
upon
the
envelope
:
<EOS>
"
Madame
Olga
Stassulevitch
,
modiste
,
Scredni
Prospect
,
231
,
Vasili
Ostroff
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
that
the
district
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
city
,
close
to
the
Little
Neva
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
drosky
at
once
,
see
her
,
and
await
a
reply
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
will
prepare
to
be
ready
when
you
return
,
"
she
wrote
.
<EOS>
"
If
Olga
is
not
at
home
,
ask
to
see
the
Red
Priest
--
in
Russian
,
'
_
Krasny
-
pastor
_
.
'
<EOS>
Return
quickly
,
as
I
fear
Woodroffe
may
come
back
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
am
lost
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
assured
her
I
would
not
lose
a
single
instant
,
and
five
minutes
later
I
was
tearing
down
the
Morskaya
in
a
drosky
along
the
canal
and
across
the
Nicholas
Bridge
to
the
address
upon
the
envelope
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
,
I
found
,
somewhat
smaller
than
its
neighbors
,
but
not
let
out
in
flats
as
the
others
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
door
was
a
large
brass
plate
bearing
the
name
,
"
Olga
Stassulevitch
:
modes
.
<EOS>
"
I
pressed
the
electric
button
,
and
in
answer
a
tall
,
clean
-
shaven
Russian
servant
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Madame
is
not
at
home
,
"
was
his
brief
reply
to
my
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
see
the
Red
Priest
,
"
I
said
in
a
lower
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
Elma
Heath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
without
further
word
,
the
man
admitted
me
into
the
long
,
dark
hall
and
closed
the
door
with
an
apology
that
the
gas
was
not
lighted
.
<EOS>
But
striking
a
match
he
led
me
up
the
broad
staircase
and
into
a
small
,
cosy
,
well
-
furnished
room
on
the
second
floor
,
evidently
the
sitting
-
room
of
some
studious
person
,
judging
from
the
books
and
critical
reviews
lying
about
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
I
waited
there
,
until
the
door
reopened
,
and
there
entered
a
man
of
medium
height
,
with
a
shock
of
long
snow
-
white
hair
and
almost
patriarchal
beard
,
whose
dark
eyes
that
age
had
dimmed
flashed
out
at
me
with
a
look
of
curious
inquiry
,
and
whose
movements
were
those
of
a
person
not
quite
at
his
ease
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
called
on
behalf
of
Mademoiselle
Elma
Heath
,
to
give
this
letter
to
Madame
Stassulevitch
,
or
if
she
is
absent
to
place
it
in
the
hands
of
the
Red
Priest
,
"
I
explained
in
my
best
Russian
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
,
"
the
old
man
responded
in
quite
good
English
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
person
you
seek
,
"
and
taking
the
letter
he
opened
it
and
read
it
through
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
by
the
expression
on
his
furrowed
face
that
its
contents
caused
him
the
utmost
consternation
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
already
pale
,
blanched
to
the
lips
,
while
in
his
eyes
there
shot
a
fire
of
quick
apprehension
.
<EOS>
The
thin
,
almost
transparent
hand
holding
the
letter
trembled
visibly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
Mademoiselle
--
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
in
a
hoarse
,
strained
voice
as
he
turned
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
help
her
to
escape
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
risk
my
own
life
in
order
to
save
hers
,
"
I
declared
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
your
devotion
to
her
is
prompted
by
what
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
suspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Then
I
confessed
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
affection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
sighed
deeply
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
young
lady
!
<EOS>
She
,
who
has
enemies
on
every
hand
,
sadly
needs
a
friend
.
<EOS>
But
can
we
trust
you
--
have
you
no
fear
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
being
implicated
in
the
coming
revolution
in
Russia
?
<EOS>
Remember
I
am
the
Red
Priest
.
<EOS>
Have
you
never
heard
of
me
?
<EOS>
My
name
is
Otto
Kampf
.
"
 
<EOS>
Otto
Kampf
!
 
<EOS>
I
stood
before
him
open
-
mouthed
.
<EOS>
Who
in
Russia
had
not
heard
of
that
mysterious
unknown
person
who
had
directed
a
hundred
conspiracies
against
the
Imperial
Autocrat
,
and
yet
the
identity
of
whom
the
police
had
always
failed
to
discover
.
<EOS>
It
was
believed
that
Kampf
had
once
been
professor
of
chemistry
at
Moscow
University
,
and
that
he
had
invented
that
most
terrible
and
destructive
explosive
used
by
the
revolutionists
.
<EOS>
The
ingredients
of
the
powerful
compound
and
the
mode
of
firing
it
was
the
secret
of
the
Nihilists
alone
--
and
Otto
Kampf
,
the
mysterious
leader
,
whose
personality
was
unknown
even
to
the
conspirators
themselves
,
directed
those
constant
attempts
which
held
the
Emperor
and
his
Government
in
such
hourly
terror
.
 
<EOS>
Rewards
without
number
had
been
offered
by
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
for
the
betrayal
and
arrest
of
the
unseen
man
whose
power
in
Russia
,
permeating
every
class
,
was
greater
than
that
of
the
Emperor
himself
--
at
whose
word
one
day
the
people
would
rise
in
a
body
and
destroy
their
oppressors
.
 
<EOS>
The
Emperor
,
the
Ministers
,
the
police
,
and
the
bureaucrats
knew
this
,
yet
they
were
powerless
--
they
knew
that
the
mysterious
professor
who
had
disappeared
from
Moscow
fifteen
years
before
and
had
never
since
been
seen
was
only
waiting
his
opportunity
to
strike
a
blow
that
would
stagger
and
crush
the
Empire
from
end
to
end
--
yet
of
his
whereabouts
they
were
in
utter
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
surprised
,
"
the
old
man
laughed
,
noticing
my
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
you
are
not
one
of
us
,
yet
I
need
not
impress
upon
you
the
absolute
necessity
,
for
Mademoiselle
's
sake
,
to
preserve
the
secret
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
It
is
because
you
are
not
a
member
of
'
The
Will
of
the
People
,
'
that
you
have
never
heard
of
'
<EOS>
The
Red
Priest'--red
because
I
wrote
my
ultimatum
to
the
Czar
in
the
blood
of
one
of
his
victims
knouted
in
the
fortress
of
Peter
and
Paul
,
and
priest
because
I
preach
the
gospel
of
freedom
and
justice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
say
nothing
,
"
I
said
,
gazing
at
the
strangely
striking
figure
before
me
--
the
unknown
man
who
directed
the
great
upheaval
that
was
to
revolutionize
Russia
.
<EOS>
"
My
only
desire
is
to
save
Mademoiselle
Heath
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
prepared
to
do
so
at
risk
of
your
own
liberty
--
your
own
life
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
said
you
love
her
.
<EOS>
Would
not
this
be
a
test
of
your
affection
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
prepared
for
any
test
,
as
long
as
she
escapes
the
trap
which
her
enemies
have
set
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
succeeded
in
saving
her
from
Kajana
,
and
I
intend
to
save
her
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Was
it
you
who
actually
entered
Kajana
and
snatched
her
from
that
tomb
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
and
he
took
my
hand
enthusiastically
,
adding--"I
have
no
further
need
to
doubt
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
turning
to
the
table
he
wrote
an
address
upon
a
slip
of
paper
,
saying
,
"
Take
Mademoiselle
there
.
<EOS>
She
will
find
a
safe
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
But
go
quickly
,
for
every
moment
places
you
both
in
more
deadly
peril
.
<EOS>
Hide
yourself
there
also
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
and
left
at
once
,
but
as
I
stepped
out
of
the
house
and
re
-
entered
the
drosky
I
saw
close
by
,
lurking
in
the
shadow
,
the
spy
of
"
The
Strangler
of
Finland
,
"
who
had
traveled
with
me
from
Abo
.
 
<EOS>
Our
eyes
met
,
and
he
recognized
me
,
notwithstanding
my
light
overcoat
and
new
hat
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
with
heart
-
sinking
,
the
ghastly
truth
flashed
upon
me
.
<EOS>
All
had
been
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Elma
was
lost
to
me
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIV
 
<EOS>
HER
HIGHNESS
IS
INQUISITIVE
  
<EOS>
Instantly
the
danger
was
apparent
,
and
instead
of
driving
back
to
the
hotel
,
I
called
out
to
the
man
to
take
me
to
the
Moscow
railway
station
,
in
order
to
put
the
spy
off
the
scent
.
<EOS>
I
knew
he
would
follow
me
,
but
as
he
was
on
foot
,
with
no
drosky
in
sight
,
I
should
be
able
to
reach
the
station
before
he
could
,
and
there
elude
him
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
stones
we
rattled
,
leaving
the
lurking
agent
standing
in
the
deep
shadow
,
but
on
turning
back
I
saw
him
dash
across
the
road
to
a
by
-
street
,
where
,
in
all
probability
,
he
had
a
conveyance
in
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
after
we
had
crossed
the
Neva
,
I
countermanded
my
order
to
the
man
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
right
up
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
Turn
into
the
Liteinoi
Prospect
to
the
left
,
and
put
me
down
there
.
<EOS>
Drive
quickly
,
and
I
'll
pay
double
fare
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
whipped
his
horses
,
and
we
turned
into
that
maze
of
dark
,
ill
-
lit
,
narrow
streets
that
lies
between
the
Vosnesenski
and
the
Nevski
,
turning
and
winding
until
we
emerged
at
last
into
the
main
thoroughfare
again
,
and
then
at
last
we
turned
into
the
street
I
had
indicated
--
a
wide
road
of
handsome
buildings
where
I
knew
I
was
certain
to
be
able
to
instantly
get
another
drosky
.
<EOS>
I
flung
the
man
his
money
,
alighted
,
and
two
minutes
later
was
driving
on
towards
the
Alexander
Bridge
,
traveling
in
a
circle
back
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
I
glanced
behind
,
but
saw
nothing
of
the
Baron
's
spy
,
who
had
evidently
gone
to
the
station
with
all
speed
,
expecting
that
I
was
leaving
the
capital
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
Elma
in
her
room
,
ready
dressed
to
go
out
,
wearing
a
long
traveling
-
cloak
,
and
in
her
hand
was
a
small
dressing
-
case
.
<EOS>
She
was
pale
and
full
of
anxiety
until
I
showed
her
the
slip
of
paper
which
Otto
Kampf
had
given
me
with
the
address
written
upon
it
,
and
then
together
we
hurried
forth
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
to
which
we
drove
was
,
we
discovered
,
a
large
one
facing
the
Fontanka
Canal
,
one
of
the
best
quarters
of
the
town
,
and
on
descending
<EOS>
I
asked
the
liveried
_
dvornick
_
for
Madame
Zurloff
,
the
name
which
the
"
Red
Priest
"
had
written
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
the
Princess
Zurloff
,
"
remarked
the
man
through
his
red
beard
.
<EOS>
"
Whom
shall
I
say
desires
to
see
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
that
,
"
I
said
,
handing
to
him
the
piece
of
paper
which
,
beside
the
address
,
bore
a
curious
cipher
-
mark
like
three
triangles
joined
.
 
<EOS>
He
closed
the
door
,
leaving
us
in
the
wide
carpeted
hall
,
the
statuary
in
which
showed
us
that
it
was
a
richly
-
furnished
place
,
and
when
a
few
minutes
later
he
returned
,
he
conducted
us
upstairs
to
a
fine
gilded
salon
,
where
an
elderly
gray
-
haired
lady
in
black
stood
gravely
to
receive
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
present
Mademoiselle
Elma
Heath
,
Princess
,
"
I
said
,
speaking
in
French
and
bowing
,
and
afterwards
telling
her
my
own
name
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hostess
welcomed
my
love
in
a
graceful
speech
,
but
I
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
unfortunately
suffers
a
terrible
affliction
.
<EOS>
She
is
deaf
and
dumb
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
how
very
,
very
sad
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
sympathetically
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
she
placed
her
hand
tenderly
upon
Elma
's
shoulder
and
looked
into
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
me
,
she
said
:
"
So
the
Red
Priest
has
sent
you
both
to
me
!
<EOS>
You
are
in
danger
of
arrest
,
I
suppose
--
you
wish
me
to
conceal
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
only
ask
sanctuary
for
Mademoiselle
,
"
was
my
reply
.
"
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
I
am
English
,
and
therefore
not
a
member
of
the
Party
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Mademoiselle
fears
arrest
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
an
order
signed
for
her
banishment
to
Saghalein
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
imprisoned
at
Kajana
,
the
fortress
away
in
Finland
,
but
I
succeeded
in
liberating
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
actually
been
in
Kajana
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
the
Princess
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
we
have
all
heard
sufficient
of
the
horrors
of
that
place
.
<EOS>
And
you
liberated
her
!
<EOS>
Why
,
she
is
the
only
person
who
has
ever
escaped
from
that
living
tomb
to
which
Oberg
sends
his
victims
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
,
Princess
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
may
I
take
it
,
m'sieur
,
that
the
reason
you
risked
your
life
for
her
is
because
you
love
her
?
<EOS>
Pardon
me
for
suggesting
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
guessed
correctly
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
Then
,
knowing
that
Elma
could
not
hear
,
I
added
:
"
I
love
her
,
but
we
are
not
lovers
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
told
her
of
my
affection
.
<EOS>
Hers
is
a
long
and
strange
story
,
and
she
will
perhaps
tell
you
something
of
it
in
writing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
exclaimed
the
gray
-
haired
lady
smiling
,
leading
my
love
across
the
luxurious
room
<EOS>
,
the
atmosphere
of
which
was
filled
with
the
scent
of
flowers
,
and
taking
off
her
cloak
with
her
own
hands
,
"
you
are
safe
here
,
my
poor
child
.
<EOS>
If
spies
have
not
followed
you
,
then
you
shall
remain
my
guest
as
long
as
you
desire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
it
is
very
good
of
you
,
Princess
,
"
I
said
gratefully
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Heath
is
the
victim
of
a
vile
and
dastardly
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
When
I
tell
you
that
she
has
been
afflicted
as
she
is
by
her
enemies
--
that
an
operation
was
performed
upon
her
in
Italy
while
she
was
unconscious
--
you
will
readily
see
in
what
deadly
peril
she
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
her
enemies
actually
done
this
?
<EOS>
Horrible
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
will
perhaps
tell
you
of
the
strange
romance
that
surrounds
her
--
a
mystery
which
I
have
not
yet
been
able
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
Russian
subject
,
although
she
has
been
educated
in
England
.
<EOS>
Baron
Oberg
himself
is
,
I
believe
,
her
worst
and
most
bitter
enemy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
Strangler
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
with
a
quick
flash
in
her
dark
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
But
his
end
is
near
.
<EOS>
The
Movement
is
active
in
Helsingfors
.
<EOS>
At
any
moment
now
we
may
strike
our
blow
for
freedom
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
an
enthusiastic
revolutionist
<EOS>
,
I
could
see
,
unsuspected
,
however
,
by
the
police
on
account
of
her
high
position
in
Petersburg
society
.
<EOS>
It
was
she
who
,
as
I
afterwards
discovered
,
had
furnished
the
large
sums
of
money
to
Kampf
for
the
continuation
of
the
revolutionary
propaganda
,
and
indeed
secretly
devoted
the
greater
part
of
her
revenues
from
her
vast
estates
in
Samara
and
Kazan
to
the
Nihilist
cause
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
himself
an
enthusiast
of
freedom
,
although
of
the
high
nobility
,
had
been
killed
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
six
years
before
,
and
since
that
time
she
had
retired
from
society
and
lived
there
quietly
,
making
the
revolutionary
movement
her
sole
occupation
.
<EOS>
The
authorities
believed
that
her
retirement
was
due
to
the
painful
loss
she
had
sustained
,
and
had
no
suspicion
that
it
was
her
money
that
enabled
the
mysterious
"
Red
Priest
"
to
slowly
but
surely
complete
the
plot
for
the
general
uprising
.
 
<EOS>
She
compelled
me
to
remove
my
coat
,
and
tea
was
served
by
a
Tartar
footman
,
whose
family
she
explained
<EOS>
had
been
serfs
of
the
Zurloffs
for
three
centuries
,
and
then
Elma
exchanged
confidences
with
her
by
means
of
paper
and
pencil
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
man
Martin
Woodroffe
,
of
whom
she
speaks
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
Princess
presently
,
turning
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
met
him
twice
--
only
twice
,
"
<EOS>
I
replied
,
"
and
under
strange
circumstances
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
continuing
,
I
told
her
something
concerning
the
incidents
of
the
yacht
_
Lola
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
be
in
love
with
her
,
and
desires
to
force
her
into
marriage
,
"
she
suggested
,
expressing
amazement
at
the
curious
narrative
I
had
related
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
for
several
reasons
.
<EOS>
One
is
because
I
know
she
holds
some
secret
concerning
him
,
and
another
because
he
is
engaged
to
an
English
girl
named
Muriel
Leithcourt
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
the
Princess
,
knitting
her
brows
with
a
puzzled
air
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
happen
to
know
her
father
's
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Philip
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
has
he
actually
been
living
in
Scotland
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
answered
in
quick
anxiety
.
"
<EOS>
He
rented
a
shoot
called
Rannoch
,
near
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
A
mysterious
incident
occurred
on
his
estate
--
a
double
murder
,
or
murder
and
suicide
;
which
is
not
quite
clear
--
but
shortly
afterwards
there
appeared
one
evening
at
the
house
a
man
named
Chater
,
Hylton
Chater
,
and
the
whole
family
at
once
fled
and
disappeared
.
"
 
<EOS>
Princess
Zurloff
sat
with
her
lips
pressed
close
together
,
looking
straight
at
the
silent
girl
before
her
.
<EOS>
Elma
had
removed
her
hat
and
cloak
,
and
now
sat
in
a
deep
easy
chair
of
yellow
silk
,
with
the
lamplight
shining
on
her
chestnut
hair
,
settled
and
calm
as
though
already
thoroughly
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
smiled
to
myself
as
I
thought
of
the
chagrin
of
Woodroffe
when
he
returned
to
find
his
victim
missing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Highness
evidently
knows
the
Leithcourts
,
"
I
hazarded
,
after
a
brief
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
of
them
,
"
was
her
unsatisfactory
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
England
sometimes
.
<EOS>
When
the
Prince
was
alive
,
we
were
often
at
Claridge
's
for
the
season
.
<EOS>
The
Prince
was
for
five
years
military
_
attache
_
at
the
Embassy
under
de
Staal
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
What
I
know
of
the
Leithcourts
is
not
to
their
credit
.
<EOS>
But
you
tell
me
that
there
was
a
mysterious
incident
before
their
flight
.
<EOS>
Explain
it
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
that
moment
the
long
white
doors
of
the
handsome
salon
were
thrown
open
by
the
faithful
Tartar
servitor
,
and
there
entered
a
man
whose
hair
fell
over
the
collar
of
his
heavy
overcoat
,
but
whom
,
in
an
instant
,
I
recognized
as
Otto
Kampf
.
 
<EOS>
Both
Elma
and
I
sprang
to
our
feet
,
while
advancing
to
the
Princess
he
bent
and
gallantly
kissed
the
hand
she
held
forth
to
him
.
<EOS>
Then
he
shook
hands
with
Elma
,
and
acknowledging
my
own
greetings
,
took
off
his
coat
and
threw
it
upon
a
chair
with
the
air
of
an
accustomed
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
come
,
Princess
,
in
order
to
explain
to
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
fears
rearrest
,
and
the
only
house
in
Petersburg
that
the
police
never
suspect
is
this
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
send
her
to
you
,
knowing
that
with
your
generosity
you
will
help
her
in
her
distress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
arranged
,
"
was
her
Highness
's
response
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
remain
here
,
poor
girl
,
until
it
is
safe
for
her
to
get
out
of
Russia
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
after
some
further
conversation
,
and
after
my
well
-
beloved
had
made
signs
of
heartfelt
gratitude
to
the
man
known
from
end
to
end
of
the
Russian
empire
as
"
The
Red
Priest
,
"
the
Princess
turned
to
me
,
saying
:
 
"
I
would
much
like
to
know
what
occurred
before
the
Leithcourts
left
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Leithcourts
!
"
exclaimed
Kampf
in
utter
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
the
Leithcourts
--
and
the
English
officer
Durnford
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
looked
into
his
eyes
in
abject
amazement
.
<EOS>
What
connection
could
Jack
Durnford
,
of
the
Marines
,
have
with
the
adventurer
Philip
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
recollected
Jack
's
word
,
when
I
had
described
the
visit
of
the
_
Lola
_
to
Leghorn
,
and
further
I
recollected
that
very
shortly
he
would
be
back
in
London
from
his
term
of
Mediterranean
service
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
after
a
pause
,
"
I
happen
to
know
Captain
Durnford
very
well
,
but
I
had
no
idea
that
he
was
friendly
with
Leithcourt
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Red
Priest
smiled
,
stroking
his
white
beard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Explain
to
her
Highness
what
she
desires
to
know
,
and
I
will
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
eyes
met
Elma
's
,
and
I
saw
how
intensely
eager
and
interested
she
was
,
watching
the
movement
of
my
lips
and
trying
to
make
out
what
words
I
uttered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
,
"
a
mysterious
tragedy
occurred
on
the
edge
of
a
wood
near
the
house
rented
by
Leithcourt
--
a
tragedy
which
has
puzzled
the
police
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
An
Italian
named
Santini
and
his
wife
were
found
murdered
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Santini
!
"
gasped
Kampf
,
starting
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
surely
he
is
not
dead
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
curious
part
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
was
killed
was
a
man
disguised
to
represent
the
Italian
,
while
the
woman
was
actually
the
waiter
's
wife
herself
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
know
the
man
Santini
<EOS>
well
,
for
both
he
and
his
wife
were
for
some
years
in
my
employ
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Princess
and
the
director
of
the
Russian
revolutionary
movement
exchanged
quick
glances
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
though
her
Highness
implored
Kampf
to
reveal
to
me
the
truth
,
while
he
,
on
his
part
,
was
averse
to
doing
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
upon
whom
does
suspicion
rest
?
"
asked
her
Highness
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
can
make
out
,
the
police
have
no
clue
whatever
,
except
one
.
<EOS>
At
the
spot
was
found
a
tiny
miniature
cross
of
one
of
the
Russian
orders
of
chivalry
--
the
Cross
of
Saint
Anne
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
suspicion
upon
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
with
some
undue
anxiety
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
he
entertain
any
guests
at
the
shooting
-
box
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
many
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
foreigners
among
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
met
any
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
all
people
from
London
--
a
smart
set
for
the
most
part
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
why
did
the
Leithcourts
disappear
so
suddenly
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
of
the
appearance
of
the
man
Chater
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
evident
that
they
feared
him
,
for
they
took
every
precaution
against
being
followed
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
they
fled
leaving
a
big
party
of
friends
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
man
Woodroffe
,
now
at
the
Hotel
de
Paris
,
is
a
friend
of
Leithcourt
as
well
as
of
Chater
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
not
a
guest
of
Leithcourt
when
this
man
representing
Santini
was
assassinated
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Kampf
,
again
stroking
his
beard
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Woodroffe
recognized
me
as
a
visitor
he
left
--
for
Hamburg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
afraid
to
face
you
because
of
the
ransacking
of
the
British
Consul
's
safe
at
Leghorn
,
"
remarked
the
Princess
,
who
,
at
the
same
moment
,
took
Elma
's
hand
tenderly
in
her
own
and
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
me
,
she
said
:
"
What
you
have
told
us
to
-
night
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
throws
a
new
light
upon
certain
incidents
that
had
hitherto
puzzled
us
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
of
it
all
is
a
great
and
inscrutable
one
--
the
mystery
of
this
poor
unfortunate
girl
,
greatest
of
all
.
<EOS>
But
both
of
us
will
endeavor
to
help
you
to
elucidate
it
;
we
will
help
poor
Elma
to
crush
her
enemies
--
these
cowardly
villains
who
had
maimed
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Princess
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
only
help
and
protect
her
,
you
will
be
doing
an
act
of
mercy
to
a
defenseless
woman
.
<EOS>
I
love
her
--
I
admit
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
my
utmost
:
I
have
striven
to
solve
the
dark
mystery
,
but
up
to
the
present
I
have
been
unsuccessful
,
and
have
only
remained
,
even
till
to
-
day
,
the
victim
of
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
her
stay
with
me
,
"
the
kindly
woman
answered
,
smiling
tenderly
upon
my
love
.
"
<EOS>
She
will
be
safe
here
,
and
in
the
meantime
we
will
endeavor
to
discover
the
real
and
actual
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
in
response
I
took
the
Princess
's
hand
and
pressed
it
fervently
.
<EOS>
Although
that
striking
,
white
-
headed
man
and
the
rather
stiff
,
formal
woman
in
black
were
the
leaders
of
the
great
and
all
-
powerful
movement
in
Russia
known
through
the
civilized
world
as
"
The
Terror
,
"
yet
they
were
nevertheless
our
friends
.
<EOS>
They
had
pledged
themselves
to
help
us
thwart
our
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
I
scribbled
a
few
hasty
words
upon
paper
and
handed
it
to
Elma
.
<EOS>
And
for
answer
she
smiled
contentedly
,
looking
into
my
eyes
with
an
expression
of
trust
,
devotion
and
love
.

CHAPTER
XV
 
<EOS>
JUST
OFF
<EOS>
THE
STRAND
  
<EOS>
A
week
had
gone
by
.
<EOS>
The
Nord
Express
had
brought
me
posthaste
across
Europe
from
Petersburg
to
Calais
,
and
I
was
again
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
had
left
Elma
in
the
care
of
the
Princess
Zurloff
,
whom
I
knew
would
conceal
her
from
the
horde
of
police
-
agents
now
in
search
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
mystery
had
so
increased
until
now
it
had
become
absolutely
bewildering
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
had
tried
to
probe
it
,
the
more
inexplicable
had
I
found
it
.
<EOS>
My
brain
was
awhirl
as
I
sat
in
the
_
wagon
-
lit
_
rushing
across
those
wide
,
never
-
ending
plains
<EOS>
that
lie
between
the
Russian
capital
and
Berlin
and
the
green
valleys
between
the
Rhine
-
lands
and
the
sea
.
<EOS>
The
maze
of
mystery
rendered
me
utterly
incapable
of
grasping
one
solid
tangible
fact
,
so
closely
interwoven
was
each
incident
of
the
strange
life
-
drama
in
which
,
through
mere
chance
,
I
was
now
playing
a
leading
part
.
<EOS>
I
was
aware
of
one
fact
only
,
that
I
loved
Elma
with
all
my
soul
,
even
though
I
knew
not
whom
she
really
was
--
or
her
strange
life
story
.
<EOS>
Her
sweet
face
,
with
those
soft
,
brown
eyes
,
so
tender
and
intense
,
stood
out
ever
before
me
,
sleeping
or
waking
.
<EOS>
Each
moment
as
the
express
rushed
south
increased
the
distance
between
us
,
yet
was
I
not
on
my
way
back
to
England
with
a
clear
and
distinct
purpose
?
<EOS>
I
snatched
at
any
clue
,
however
small
,
with
desperate
eagerness
,
as
a
drowning
man
clutches
at
a
straw
.
 
<EOS>
The
spy
from
Abo
had
seen
me
on
the
railway
platform
on
my
departure
from
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
He
had
overheard
me
buy
a
ticket
for
London
,
and
previous
to
stepping
into
the
train
I
had
smiled
at
him
in
glad
triumph
.
<EOS>
My
journey
was
too
long
a
one
for
him
to
follow
,
and
I
knew
that
I
had
at
last
outwitted
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
expected
to
see
Elma
with
me
,
no
doubt
,
and
his
disappointment
was
plainly
marked
.
<EOS>
But
of
Woodroffe
I
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
.

<EOS>
It
was
a
cold
but
dry
November
night
in
London
,
and
I
sat
dining
with
Jack
Durnford
at
a
small
table
in
the
big
,
well
-
lit
room
of
the
Junior
United
Service
Club
.
<EOS>
Easy
-
going
and
merry
as
of
old
,
my
friend
was
bubbling
over
with
good
spirits
,
delighted
to
be
back
again
in
town
after
three
years
sailing
up
and
down
the
Mediterranean
,
from
Gib
.
<EOS>
to
Smyrna
,
maneuvering
always
,
yet
with
never
a
chance
of
a
fight
.
<EOS>
His
well
-
shaven
face
bore
the
mark
of
the
southern
suns
,
and
the
backs
of
his
hands
were
tanned
by
the
heat
and
the
sea
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
indeed
,
as
smart
an
officer
as
any
at
the
Junior
,
for
the
Marines
are
proverbial
for
their
neatness
,
and
his
men
on
board
the
_
Bulwark
_
had
received
many
a
pleasing
compliment
from
the
Admiral
.
 
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
be
back
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
he
helped
himself
to
a
"
peg
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
should
rather
think
so
,
old
chap
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
awfully
wearying
the
life
becomes
out
there
.
<EOS>
Lots
going
on
down
at
Palermo
,
Malta
,
Monte
Carlo
,
or
over
at
Algiers
,
and
yet
we
can
never
get
a
chance
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
're
always
in
sight
of
the
gay
places
,
and
never
land
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
blame
the
youngsters
for
getting
off
from
Leghorn
for
two
days
over
here
in
town
when
they
can
.
<EOS>
Three
years
is
a
bigger
slice
out
of
a
fellow
's
life
than
anyone
would
suppose
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
the
way
,
I
saw
Hutcheson
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
We
put
into
Spezia
,
and
he
came
out
to
see
the
Admiral
--
got
despatches
for
him
<EOS>
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
He
seems
as
gay
as
ever
.
<EOS>
He
lunched
at
mess
,
and
said
how
sorry
he
was
you
'd
deserted
Leghorn
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
exactly
deserted
it
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
really
do
n't
love
it
like
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
A
year
or
two
of
the
Mediterranean
blue
is
quite
sufficient
to
last
any
fellow
his
lifetime
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
live
in
Leghorn
if
I
had
my
choice
.
<EOS>
I
'd
prefer
somewhere
up
in
the
mountains
,
beyond
Pisa
,
or
outside
Florence
,
where
you
can
have
a
good
time
in
winter
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
a
silence
fell
between
us
,
and
I
sat
eating
on
until
the
end
of
the
meal
,
wondering
how
to
broach
the
question
I
so
desired
to
put
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
try
if
I
can
get
on
recruiting
service
at
home
for
a
bit
,
"
he
said
presently
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
an
appointment
up
in
Glasgow
vacant
,
and
I
shall
try
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
better
,
at
any
rate
,
than
China
or
the
Pacific
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
just
about
to
turn
the
conversation
to
the
visit
of
the
mysterious
_
Lola
_
to
Leghorn
,
when
two
men
he
knew
entered
the
dining
-
room
,
and
,
recognizing
him
,
came
across
to
give
him
a
welcome
home
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
newcomers
was
Major
Bartlett
,
whom
I
at
once
recollected
as
having
been
a
guest
of
Leithcourt
's
up
at
Rannoch
,
and
the
other
a
younger
man
whom
Durnford
introduced
to
me
as
Captain
Hanbury
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Major
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
rising
and
grasping
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
seen
you
since
Scotland
,
and
the
extraordinary
ending
to
your
house
-
party
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
an
amazing
affair
,
was
n't
it
?
<EOS>
After
the
Leithcourts
left
it
was
like
<EOS>
pandemonium
let
loose
;
the
guests
collared
everything
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
wonder
to
me
<EOS>
the
disgraceful
affair
did
n't
get
into
the
papers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
where
's
Leithcourt
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
the
ghost
of
an
idea
,
"
replied
the
Major
,
standing
astride
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
"
<EOS>
Young
Paget
of
ours
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
saw
Muriel
driving
in
the
Terminus
Road
at
Eastbourne
,
but
she
did
n't
notice
him
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
queerish
lot
,
those
Leithcourts
,
"
he
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
!
<EOS>
What
are
you
saying
about
the
Leithcourts
,
Charley
?
"
exclaimed
Durnford
,
turning
quickly
from
Hanbury
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
some
people
of
that
name
--
Philip
Leithcourt
,
who
has
a
daughter
named
Muriel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
they
sound
much
the
same
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
know
them
,
my
dear
old
chap
,
I
really
do
n't
envy
you
your
friends
,
"
declared
the
Major
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Gregg
will
tell
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
knows
,
perhaps
,
more
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
added
,
"
they
may
not
,
of
course
,
be
the
same
people
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
first
met
them
yachting
over
at
Algiers
,
"
Jack
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
then
again
at
Malta
,
where
they
seemed
to
have
quite
a
lot
of
friends
.
<EOS>
They
had
a
steam
-
yacht
,
the
_
Iris
_
,
and
were
often
up
and
down
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Must
be
the
same
people
,
"
declared
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
Leithcourt
spoke
once
or
twice
of
his
yacht
,
but
we
all
put
it
down
as
a
non
-
existent
vessel
,
because
he
was
always
drawing
the
long
bow
about
his
adventures
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
first
come
to
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
of
the
Major
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Somebody
brought
him
to
mess
,
and
we
struck
up
an
acquaintance
across
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
a
good
chap
,
and
when
he
asked
me
to
shoot
I
accepted
.
<EOS>
On
arrival
up
at
Rannoch
,
however
,
one
thing
struck
me
as
jolly
strange
,
and
that
was
that
among
the
people
I
was
asked
to
meet
<EOS>
was
one
of
the
very
worst
blacklegs
about
town
.
<EOS>
He
called
himself
Martin
Woodroffe
up
there
--
although
I
'd
known
him
at
the
old
Corinthian
Club
as
Dick
Archer
.
<EOS>
He
was
believed
then
to
be
one
of
a
clever
gang
of
international
thieves
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
first
met
him
he
gave
me
the
name
of
Hornby
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
Leghorn
,
where
he
was
on
board
a
yacht
called
the
_
Lola
_
,
of
which
he
represented
himself
as
owner
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
left
Rannoch
very
suddenly
,
"
remarked
Bartlett
.
<EOS>
"
We
understood
that
he
was
engaged
to
marry
Muriel
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
'm
sorry
for
her
,
poor
girl
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Durnford
,
starting
up
.
<EOS>
"
That
man
to
marry
Muriel
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
his
countenance
had
turned
pale
,
and
he
gave
no
answer
to
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
these
same
Leithcourts
are
really
friends
of
yours
,
Durnford
,
old
fellow
,
I
'm
sorry
I
've
said
anything
against
them
,
"
the
Major
exclaimed
in
an
apologetic
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Only
the
end
of
my
visit
was
so
abrupt
and
so
extraordinary
,
and
the
company
such
a
mixed
one
,
that
--
well
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
the
people
are
a
mysterious
lot
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
our
Leithcourts
are
not
the
same
as
those
Jack
knows
,
"
I
remarked
,
in
order
to
escape
from
a
rather
difficult
situation
;
<EOS>
whereupon
Durnford
,
as
though
eager
to
conceal
his
surprise
,
said
with
a
forced
laugh
,
"
Oh
!
probably
not
,
"
and
reseated
himself
at
table
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Major
quickly
changed
the
topic
of
conversation
,
and
afterwards
he
and
his
friend
passed
along
to
their
table
and
sat
down
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
noticing
that
Jack
Durnford
was
upset
at
what
he
had
learnt
,
yet
I
hesitated
just
then
to
put
any
question
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
approach
the
subject
later
,
so
as
to
allow
him
time
to
question
me
if
he
wished
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
After
smoking
an
hour
we
went
across
to
the
Empire
,
where
we
spent
the
evening
in
the
grand
circle
,
meeting
many
men
we
knew
and
having
a
rather
pleasant
time
among
old
acquaintances
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
who
had
lived
the
club
life
of
London
returns
from
abroad
,
he
can
always
run
across
someone
he
knows
in
the
circle
of
the
Empire
about
ten
o'clock
at
night
.
<EOS>
Jack
was
,
however
,
not
his
old
self
that
he
had
been
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
His
brow
was
now
heavy
and
thoughtful
,
and
he
appeared
deeply
immersed
in
some
intricate
problem
,
for
his
eyes
were
fixed
vacantly
when
opportunity
was
afforded
him
to
think
,
and
he
appeared
to
desire
to
avoid
his
friends
rather
than
to
greet
them
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
theater
I
induced
him
to
come
round
to
the
Cecil
,
and
in
the
wicker
chair
in
the
big
portico
before
the
entrance
we
sat
to
smoke
our
final
cigars
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
favorite
spot
of
mine
when
in
London
,
for
at
afternoon
,
when
the
string
band
plays
and
the
Americans
and
other
cosmopolitans
drink
tea
,
there
is
a
continual
coming
and
going
,
<EOS>
a
little
panorama
of
life
that
to
a
student
of
men
like
myself
is
intensely
interesting
.
<EOS>
And
at
night
it
is
just
as
amusing
to
sit
there
in
the
shadow
and
watch
the
people
returning
from
the
theaters
or
dances
and
to
speculate
as
to
whom
and
what
they
are
.
<EOS>
At
that
one
little
corner
of
London
just
off
the
Strand
you
see
more
variety
of
men
and
women
than
perhaps
at
any
other
spot
.
<EOS>
All
grades
pass
before
you
,
from
the
pushful
American
commercial
man
interested
in
a
patent
medicine
,
to
the
proud
Indian
Rajah
with
his
turbaned
suite
;
from
the
variety
actress
to
the
daughter
of
a
peer
,
or
the
wife
of
a
millionaire
pork
-
butcher
doing
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
a
bit
down
in
the
mouth
to
-
night
,
Jack
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
presently
,
after
we
had
been
watching
the
cabs
coming
up
,
depositing
the
home
-
coming
revelers
from
the
Savoy
or
the
Carlton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
sighed
.
"
<EOS>
And
surely
I
have
enough
to
cause
me
--
after
what
I
've
heard
from
Bartlett
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Did
the
facts
he
told
us
convey
any
bad
news
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
with
pretended
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
hoarsely
,
after
a
brief
pause
.
<EOS>
Then
he
added
:
"
Bartlett
said
you
could
tell
me
what
happened
up
in
Scotland
,
where
Leithcourt
had
shooting
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
everything
,
"
he
added
with
the
air
of
a
man
in
whom
all
hope
is
dead
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
began
,
"
the
Leithcourts
took
Rannoch
Castle
,
close
to
my
uncle
's
place
,
near
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
I
got
to
know
them
,
of
course
,
and
often
shot
with
his
party
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
however
,
I
was
amazed
to
notice
in
one
of
the
rooms
the
photograph
of
a
lady
,
the
exact
counterpart
of
that
picture
which
,
I
recollect
,
I
told
you
when
in
Leghorn
I
had
found
torn
up
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
You
recollect
what
I
narrated
about
my
strange
adventure
,
do
n't
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
every
word
,
"
was
his
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Go
on
.
<EOS>
What
did
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
I
held
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
discovered
that
the
fellow
who
called
himself
Woodroffe
--
the
man
who
had
represented
himself
as
the
owner
of
the
_
Lola
_
,
and
who
,
no
doubt
,
had
had
a
hand
in
breaking
open
Hutcheson
's
safe
in
the
Consulate
--
was
engaged
to
Muriel
,
I
became
full
of
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Woodroffe
,
after
meeting
me
,
disappeared
--
went
to
Hamburg
,
they
said
,
on
business
.
<EOS>
Then
other
things
occurred
.
<EOS>
A
man
and
woman
were
found
murdered
up
in
the
wood
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
castle
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
made
up
to
represent
my
man
<EOS>
Olinto
<EOS>
--
I
believe
you
've
seen
him
in
Leghorn
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
They
've
killed
Olinto
?
<EOS>
"
he
gasped
,
starting
from
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
was
made
up
very
much
like
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
wife
Armida
was
killed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
killed
the
woman
,
and
believed
they
had
also
killed
her
husband
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
bitterly
through
his
teeth
,
and
I
saw
that
his
strong
hands
grasped
the
arms
of
his
chair
firmly
.
"
<EOS>
And
Martin
Woodroffe
is
engaged
to
Muriel
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
Are
you
certain
of
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
quite
certain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
is
there
no
suspicion
as
to
who
is
the
assassin
of
the
woman
Santini
and
this
mysterious
man
who
posed
as
her
husband
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
For
some
time
Jack
Durnford
smoked
in
silence
,
and
I
could
just
distinguish
his
white
,
hard
face
in
the
faint
light
,
for
it
was
now
late
,
and
the
big
electric
lamps
had
been
turned
out
and
we
were
in
semi
-
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
fellow
shall
never
marry
Muriel
,
"
he
declared
in
a
fierce
,
hoarse
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
you
have
just
told
me
reveals
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Did
you
meet
Chater
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
appeared
suddenly
at
Rannoch
,
and
the
Leithcourts
fled
precipitately
and
have
not
since
been
heard
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
no
wonder
!
"
<EOS>
he
remarked
with
a
dry
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
No
wonder
!
<EOS>
But
look
here
,
Gordon
,
I
'm
not
going
to
stand
by
and
let
that
scoundrel
Woodroffe
marry
Muriel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
love
her
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
I
hazarded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
love
her
,
"
he
admitted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
by
heaven
!
"
he
cried
,
"
I
will
tell
the
truth
and
crush
the
whole
of
their
ingenious
plot
.
<EOS>
Have
you
met
Elma
Heath
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
in
quick
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
listen
,
"
he
said
in
a
low
,
earnest
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Listen
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
something
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
greater
mystery
surrounding
that
yacht
,
the
_
Lola
_
,
than
you
have
ever
imagined
,
my
dear
old
chap
,
"
declared
Jack
Durnford
,
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
told
me
about
it
on
the
quarter
-
deck
that
day
outside
Leghorn
,
I
was
half
a
mind
to
tell
you
what
I
knew
.
<EOS>
Only
one
fact
prevented
me
--
my
disinclination
to
reveal
my
own
secrets
.
<EOS>
I
loved
Muriel
Leithcourt
,
yet
,
afloat
<EOS>
as
I
was
,
I
could
never
see
her
--
I
could
not
obtain
from
her
own
lips
the
explanation
I
desired
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
would
not
prejudge
her
--
no
,
and
I
wo
n't
now
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
with
a
fierce
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
love
her
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
and
she
reciprocates
my
love
.
<EOS>
Ours
is
a
secret
engagement
made
in
Malta
two
years
ago
,
and
yet
you
tell
me
that
she
has
pledged
herself
to
that
fellow
Woodroffe
--
the
man
known
here
in
London
as
Dick
Archer
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
believe
it
--
<EOS>
I
really
ca
n't
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
write
to
me
as
she
has
done
,
urging
patience
and
secrecy
until
my
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unless
,
of
course
,
she
desired
to
gain
time
,
"
I
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
friend
was
silent
;
his
brows
were
deep
knit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Woodroffe
is
at
the
present
moment
in
Petersburg
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
just
come
back
from
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
St.
Petersburg
!
"
he
gasped
,
surprised
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
is
with
that
villainous
official
,
Baron
Oberg
,
the
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
Oberg
is
living
shut
up
in
his
palace
at
Helsingfors
,
fearing
to
go
out
lest
he
shall
be
assassinated
,
"
was
my
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
Elma
?
<EOS>
What
has
become
of
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
hiding
in
Petersburg
,
awaiting
such
time
as
I
can
get
her
safely
out
of
Russia
,
"
and
then
,
continuing
,
I
explained
how
she
had
been
maimed
and
rendered
deaf
and
dumb
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
fiercely
.
"
<EOS>
Have
they
actually
done
that
to
the
poor
girl
?
<EOS>
Then
they
feared
that
she
should
reveal
the
nature
of
their
plot
,
for
she
had
seen
and
heard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Seen
and
heard
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
patient
;
we
will
elucidate
this
mystery
,
and
the
motive
of
this
terrible
infliction
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Muriel
wrote
to
me
saying
that
poor
Elma
,
her
friend
,
had
disappeared
,
and
she
feared
that
some
evil
had
also
happened
to
her
.
<EOS>
So
Oberg
had
sent
her
to
his
fortress
--
his
own
private
Bastille
--
the
place
to
which
,
on
pretended
charges
of
conspiracy
against
Russia
,
he
sends
those
who
thwart
him
to
a
living
tomb
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
him
,
and
I
have
defied
him
,
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
!
<EOS>
Man
alive
!
<EOS>
be
careful
.
<EOS>
He
's
not
a
fellow
who
sticks
at
trifles
,
"
said
Jack
warningly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
fear
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Elma
's
enemies
are
also
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
take
it
,
old
fellow
,
that
notwithstanding
her
affliction
,
you
are
actually
in
love
with
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
rescue
,
and
to
marry
her
,
"
I
answered
quite
frankly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
first
we
must
tear
aside
this
veil
of
mystery
and
ascertain
all
the
facts
concerning
her
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
At
present
I
only
know
one
or
two
very
vague
details
.
<EOS>
The
baron
is
certainly
not
her
uncle
,
as
he
represents
himself
to
be
,
but
it
seems
certain
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
Anglo
-
Russian
parents
,
and
was
born
in
Russia
and
brought
to
England
when
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
from
whom
do
you
expect
I
can
obtain
the
true
facts
concerning
her
,
and
the
reason
of
the
baron
's
desire
to
keep
her
silent
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
twisting
his
mustache
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
just
the
question
.
<EOS>
For
a
solution
of
the
problem
we
must
first
fathom
the
motive
of
the
Leithcourts
and
the
reason
they
fled
in
fear
before
that
fellow
Chater
.
<EOS>
That
Muriel
is
innocent
of
any
complicity
in
their
plot
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
I
feel
convinced
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
the
victim
of
that
blackleg
Woodroffe
,
who
,
as
Bartlett
has
told
you
,
is
one
of
the
most
expert
swindlers
in
London
,
and
who
has
already
done
two
terms
of
penal
servitude
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
was
the
motive
in
breaking
open
the
Consul
's
safe
,
if
not
to
obtain
the
Foreign
Office
or
Admiralty
ciphers
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
wanted
to
steal
them
and
sell
them
to
a
foreign
government
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
that
was
not
their
object
.
<EOS>
I
've
thought
over
it
many
,
many
times
since
you
told
me
,
and
I
feel
convinced
that
Woodroffe
is
too
shrewd
a
fellow
not
to
have
known
that
no
Consul
goes
away
on
leave
and
allows
his
ciphers
to
remain
behind
.
<EOS>
When
he
leaves
his
post
he
always
deposits
those
precious
books
either
at
the
Foreign
Office
here
or
with
his
Consul
-
General
,
or
with
a
Consul
at
another
port
.
<EOS>
They
'd
surely
ascertain
all
that
before
they
made
the
raid
,
you
bet
.
<EOS>
The
affair
was
a
risky
one
,
and
Dick
Archer
is
known
as
a
man
of
many
precautions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
on
extremely
friendly
terms
with
Elma
.
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
succeeded
in
finding
her
in
Finland
,
and
taking
her
beyond
Oberg
's
sphere
of
influence
to
Petersburg
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
certainly
only
an
affected
friendship
,
with
some
sinister
motive
underlying
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
wrote
a
letter
from
her
island
prison
to
an
old
schoolfellow
named
Lydia
Moreton
,
asking
her
to
see
Woodroffe
at
his
rooms
in
Cork
Street
,
and
tell
him
that
through
all
she
was
suffering
she
had
kept
her
promise
to
him
,
and
that
the
secret
was
still
safe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
fellow
fears
that
as
you
are
so
actively
searching
out
the
truth
,
she
may
yield
to
your
demands
and
explain
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
intends
to
silence
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
to
kill
her
,
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
,
in
quick
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
might
do
so
,
in
order
to
save
himself
,
you
see
,
"
Jack
replied
,
adding
:
"
He
certainly
would
have
no
compunction
if
he
thought
that
it
would
not
be
brought
home
to
him
.
<EOS>
Only
he
,
no
doubt
,
fears
you
,
because
you
have
found
her
,
and
are
in
love
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
admitted
the
force
of
his
argument
,
but
recollected
that
my
dear
one
was
safe
in
concealment
,
and
that
the
Princess
was
our
friend
,
even
though
I
,
as
an
Englishman
,
had
no
sympathy
with
the
doctrine
of
the
bomb
and
the
knife
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
get
from
him
all
that
he
knew
concerning
Elma
,
but
he
seemed
,
for
some
curious
reason
,
disinclined
to
tell
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
gather
was
that
Leithcourt
was
in
league
with
Chater
and
Woodroffe
,
and
that
Muriel
had
acted
as
an
entirely
innocent
agent
.
<EOS>
What
the
conspiracy
was
,
or
what
was
its
motive
,
I
could
not
discern
.
<EOS>
I
was
as
far
off
the
solution
of
the
problem
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
first
find
Muriel
,
"
he
declared
,
when
I
pressed
him
to
tell
me
everything
he
knew
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
facts
you
have
told
me
which
negative
my
own
theories
,
and
only
from
her
<EOS>
can
we
obtain
the
real
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
surely
you
know
where
she
is
?
<EOS>
She
writes
to
you
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
last
letter
,
which
I
received
at
Gib
.
<EOS>
ten
days
ago
,
was
from
the
Hotel
Bristol
,
at
Botzen
,
in
the
Tyrol
,
yet
Bartlett
says
she
has
been
seen
down
at
Eastbourne
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
an
address
where
you
always
write
to
her
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
a
secret
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
written
and
made
an
appointment
,
but
she
has
not
kept
it
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
prevented
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
with
her
parents
,
and
unable
to
come
to
London
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
know
that
they
had
fled
,
and
were
in
hiding
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
What
I
've
heard
to
-
night
is
news
to
me
--
amazing
news
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
does
it
not
convey
to
you
the
truth
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
--
a
ghastly
truth
concerning
Elma
Heath
<EOS>
,
"
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
,
as
though
speaking
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
.
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
I
'm
dying
,
Jack
,
to
know
everything
concerning
her
.
<EOS>
Who
is
that
fellow
Oberg
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
enemy
.
<EOS>
She
,
by
mere
accident
,
learned
his
secret
and
Woodroffe
's
,
and
they
now
both
live
in
deadly
fear
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
for
that
reason
she
was
taken
to
Siena
,
where
some
villainous
Italian
doctor
was
bribed
to
render
her
deaf
and
dumb
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
Chater
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
very
little
concerning
him
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
conspired
with
them
,
or
he
may
be
innocent
.
<EOS>
It
seems
as
though
he
were
antagonistic
to
their
schemes
,
if
Leithcourt
and
his
family
really
fled
from
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
he
was
on
board
the
_
Lola
_
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
may
have
helped
to
commit
the
burglary
at
the
Consulate
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
likely
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
our
first
object
must
be
to
rediscover
Muriel
.
<EOS>
Paget
says
she
is
in
Eastbourne
.
<EOS>
If
she
is
there
,
we
shall
easily
find
her
.
<EOS>
They
publish
visitors
'
lists
in
the
papers
,
do
n't
they
,
like
they
do
at
Hastings
?
<EOS>
"
Then
he
added
:
"
Visitors
'
lists
are
most
annoying
when
you
find
your
name
printed
in
them
when
you
are
supposed
officially
to
be
somewhere
else
.
<EOS>
I
was
had
once
like
that
by
the
Bournemouth
papers
,
when
I
was
supposed
to
be
on
duty
over
at
Queenstown
.
<EOS>
I
narrowly
escaped
a
terrible
wigging
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
to
Eastbourne
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
there
with
you
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Or
would
it
not
be
best
to
send
an
urgent
wire
to
the
address
where
I
always
write
?
<EOS>
She
would
then
reply
here
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
If
she
's
in
Eastbourne
,
there
may
be
reasons
why
she
can
not
come
up
to
town
.
<EOS>
If
her
people
are
in
hiding
,
of
course
she
wo
n't
come
.
<EOS>
But
she
'll
make
an
appointment
with
me
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Send
a
wire
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
make
it
urgent
.
<EOS>
It
will
then
be
forwarded
.
<EOS>
But
as
regards
Olinto
?
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
see
him
?
<EOS>
He
might
tell
you
more
than
he
has
told
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
by
no
means
.
<EOS>
He
must
not
know
that
I
have
returned
to
London
,
"
declared
my
friend
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
not
see
him
--
you
understand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
his
interests
are
--
well
,
not
exactly
our
own
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
do
n't
you
tell
me
more
about
Elma
?
<EOS>
"
I
urged
,
for
I
was
eager
to
learn
all
he
knew
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
do
tell
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
implored
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
told
you
practically
everything
,
my
dear
old
fellow
,
"
was
his
response
.
<EOS>
"
The
revelation
of
the
true
facts
of
the
affair
can
be
made
only
by
Muriel
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
we
must
find
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
must
--
at
all
hazards
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
's
go
across
to
the
telegraph
office
opposite
Charing
Cross
.
<EOS>
It
's
open
always
.
"
<EOS>
And
we
rose
and
walked
out
along
the
Strand
,
now
nearly
deserted
,
and
despatched
an
urgent
message
to
Muriel
at
an
address
in
Hurlingham
Road
,
Fulham
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
we
stood
outside
on
the
curb
,
still
talking
,
I
loth
to
part
from
him
,
when
there
passed
by
in
the
shadow
two
men
in
dark
overcoats
,
who
crossed
the
road
behind
us
to
the
front
of
Charing
Cross
station
,
and
then
continued
on
towards
Trafalgar
Square
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
fell
upon
them
,
I
thought
I
recognized
the
face
of
one
as
that
of
a
person
I
had
seen
before
,
yet
I
was
not
at
all
certain
,
and
my
failure
to
remember
whom
the
passer
-
by
resembled
prevented
me
from
saying
anything
further
to
Jack
than
:
 
"
A
fellow
I
know
has
just
gone
by
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
seem
to
be
meeting
hosts
of
friends
to
-
night
,
"
he
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
old
chap
,
it
does
one
good
to
come
back
to
our
dear
,
dirty
old
town
again
.
<EOS>
We
abuse
it
when
we
are
here
,
and
talk
of
the
life
in
Paris
,
and
Vienna
,
and
Brussels
,
but
when
we
are
away
there
is
no
place
on
earth
so
dear
to
us
,
for
it
is
'
home
.
'
<EOS>
But
there
!
"
he
laughed
,
"
I
'm
actually
growing
romantic
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
if
we
could
only
find
Muriel
!
<EOS>
But
we
must
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Ta
-
ta
!
<EOS>
I
shall
go
around
to
the
club
and
sleep
,
for
I
have
n't
fixed
on
any
diggings
yet
.
<EOS>
Come
in
at
ten
to
-
morrow
,
and
we
will
decide
upon
some
plan
.
<EOS>
One
thing
is
plainly
certain
;
Elma
must
at
once
be
got
out
of
Russia
.
<EOS>
She
's
in
deadly
peril
of
her
life
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
help
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
old
fellow
,
"
answered
my
friend
,
warmly
grasping
my
hand
,
and
then
we
parted
,
he
strolling
along
towards
the
National
Gallery
on
his
way
back
to
the
"
Junior
,
"
while
I
returned
to
the
_
Cecil
_
alone
.

CHAPTER
XVI
 
<EOS>
MARKED
<EOS>
MEN
  
"
Captain
Durnford
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
of
the
hall
-
porter
of
the
club
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
he
slept
here
last
night
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
appointment
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
man
consulted
the
big
book
before
him
,
and
answered
:
 
"
Captain
Durnford
went
out
at
9:27
last
night
,
sir
,
but
has
not
returned
.
"
 
<EOS>
Strange
,
I
thought
,
<EOS>
but
although
I
waited
in
the
club
nearly
an
hour
,
he
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
called
again
at
noon
,
and
he
had
not
come
in
,
and
again
at
two
o'clock
,
but
he
had
not
even
then
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
Then
I
began
to
be
anxious
.
<EOS>
I
returned
to
the
hotel
,
resolved
to
wait
for
a
few
hours
longer
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
altered
his
mind
and
gone
to
Eastbourne
in
search
of
Muriel
;
yet
,
had
he
done
so
,
he
would
surely
have
telegraphed
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
About
four
o'clock
,
as
I
was
passing
through
the
big
hall
of
the
hotel
<EOS>
,
I
heard
a
voice
behind
me
utter
a
greeting
in
Italian
,
and
turning
in
surprise
,
found
<EOS>
Olinto
,
dressed
in
his
best
suit
of
black
,
standing
hat
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
I
recollected
what
Jack
had
told
me
,
and
regarded
him
with
some
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Signor
Commendatore
,
"
he
said
in
a
low
voice
,
as
though
fearing
to
be
overheard
,
"
may
I
be
permitted
to
speak
in
private
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
I
said
,
and
I
took
him
in
the
lift
up
to
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
warn
you
,
signore
,
"
he
said
,
when
I
had
given
him
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
enemies
mean
harm
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
are
they
,
pray
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
biting
my
lips
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
same
,
I
suppose
,
who
prepared
that
ingenious
trap
in
Lambeth
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
here
to
reveal
to
you
who
they
are
,
signore
,
only
to
warn
you
to
have
a
care
of
yourself
,
"
was
the
Italian
's
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Olinto
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
determinedly
,
"
I
've
had
enough
of
this
confounded
mystery
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
truth
regarding
the
assassination
of
your
poor
wife
up
in
Scotland
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
signore
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
sadly
in
a
changed
voice
,
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
plot
.
<EOS>
Someone
represented
me
--
but
he
was
killed
also
.
<EOS>
They
believed
they
had
struck
me
down
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Armida
's
body
was
found
concealed
behind
a
rock
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
I
saw
it
--
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
shuddering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
ignorant
of
the
identity
of
your
wife
's
assassin
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Entirely
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
one
thing
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Did
Armida
possess
any
trinket
in
the
form
of
a
little
enameled
cross
--
like
a
miniature
cross
of
cavaliere
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
gave
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
found
it
on
the
floor
at
the
Mansion
House
,
where
I
was
engaged
as
odd
waiter
for
a
banquet
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
ought
to
have
given
it
up
to
the
Lord
Mayor
's
servants
,
but
it
was
such
a
pretty
little
thing
that
I
was
tempted
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
It
probably
had
fallen
from
the
coat
of
one
of
the
diplomatists
dining
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
silent
.
<EOS>
The
faint
suspicion
that
Oberg
had
been
at
that
spot
was
now
entirely
removed
.
<EOS>
The
only
clue
I
had
was
satisfactorily
accounted
for
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
,
Signor
Commendatore
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
the
cross
was
found
at
the
spot
,
and
was
believed
to
have
been
dropped
by
the
assassin
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
The
police
had
,
it
seemed
,
succeeded
in
discovering
the
unfortunate
woman
after
all
,
and
had
found
that
she
was
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
a
man
named
Leithcourt
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
a
few
moments
later
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
In
this
affair
,
Olinto
,
our
interests
are
mutual
,
are
they
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
nodded
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
also
a
man
named
Archer
--
who
is
sometimes
known
as
Hornby
,
or
Woodroffe
--
as
well
as
a
friend
of
his
called
Chater
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Si
,
signore
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
met
them
all
--
to
my
regret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
have
you
ever
met
a
Russian
--
a
certain
Baron
Oberg
--
and
his
niece
,
Elma
Heath
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
niece
?
<EOS>
She
is
n't
his
niece
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
who
is
she
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
know
?
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
once
or
twice
.
<EOS>
But
she
's
dead
,
is
n't
she
?
<EOS>
She
knew
the
secret
of
those
men
,
and
they
intended
to
kill
her
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
prevent
them
taking
her
away
on
the
yacht
,
and
I
would
have
gone
to
the
police
--
<EOS>
only
I
dare
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
because
my
own
hands
were
not
quite
clean
,
"
he
answered
after
a
pause
,
his
eyes
fixed
upon
mine
the
while
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
they
intended
to
silence
her
,
but
I
was
powerless
to
save
her
,
poor
young
lady
.
<EOS>
They
took
her
on
board
Leithcourt
's
yacht
,
the
_
Iris
_
,
and
they
sailed
for
the
Mediterranean
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
the
name
and
appearance
of
the
yacht
was
altered
on
the
voyage
,
and
it
became
the
_
Lola
_
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
he
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
_
Iris
_
was
a
steamer
of
many
names
,
and
had
,
I
believe
,
been
painted
nearly
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
at
various
times
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
mysterious
vessel
,
but
she
exists
no
more
.
<EOS>
They
scuttled
her
somewhere
up
in
the
Baltic
,
I
've
heard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
this
Oberg
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
urging
him
to
reveal
to
me
all
he
knew
concerning
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
stands
in
great
fear
of
the
poor
young
lady
,
I
believe
,
for
it
was
at
his
instigation
that
Leithcourt
and
his
friends
took
her
on
that
fatal
yachting
cruise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
was
your
connection
with
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
was
Leithcourt
's
servant
,
"
was
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
steward
on
the
_
Iris
_
for
a
year
,
until
I
suppose
they
thought
that
I
began
to
see
too
much
,
and
then
I
was
placed
in
a
position
ashore
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
you
see
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
More
than
I
care
to
tell
,
signore
.
<EOS>
If
they
were
arrested
I
should
be
arrested
,
too
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
mean
to
solve
this
mystery
,
Olinto
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
fiercely
,
for
I
was
in
no
trifling
mood
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
fathom
it
if
it
costs
me
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
signore
solves
it
himself
,
then
I
can
not
be
charged
with
revealing
the
truth
,
"
was
the
man
's
diplomatic
reply
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
fear
that
they
are
far
too
wary
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Armida
has
lost
her
life
.
<EOS>
Surely
that
is
sufficient
incentive
for
you
to
bring
them
all
to
justice
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
law
falls
upon
them
,
it
will
also
fall
upon
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
explained
the
terrible
affliction
to
which
my
love
had
been
subjected
by
those
heartless
brutes
,
whereupon
he
cried
enthusiastically
:
 
<EOS>
"
Then
she
is
not
dead
!
<EOS>
She
can
tell
us
everything
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
can
not
you
tell
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
all
.
<EOS>
The
secret
she
knows
has
never
been
revealed
.
<EOS>
They
feared
she
might
be
incautious
,
and
for
that
reason
Oberg
made
the
villainous
suggestion
of
the
yachting
trip
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
be
drowned
--
accidentally
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
St.
Petersburg
now
.
<EOS>
I
left
her
a
week
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
Russia
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
signore
,
for
her
sake
,
do
n't
allow
the
young
lady
to
remain
there
.
<EOS>
The
Baron
is
all
-
powerful
.
<EOS>
He
does
what
he
wishes
in
Russia
,
and
the
more
merciless
he
is
to
the
people
he
governs
,
<EOS>
the
greater
rewards
he
receives
from
the
Czar
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
in
Russia
,
but
surely
it
must
be
a
strange
country
,
signore
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
,
sitting
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
looking
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
prepared
to
denounce
them
if
I
bring
the
Signorina
Heath
here
,
to
England
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
the
use
,
if
we
have
no
clear
proof
?
"
was
his
evasive
reply
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
plainly
that
he
feared
being
himself
implicated
in
some
extraordinary
plot
,
the
exact
nature
of
which
he
so
steadfastly
refused
to
reveal
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
talked
on
for
fully
half
an
hour
,
and
from
his
conversation
I
gathered
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
Elma
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
signore
,
she
was
such
a
pleasant
and
kind
-
hearted
young
lady
.
<EOS>
I
always
felt
very
sorry
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
deadly
fear
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
they
were
thieves
?
<EOS>
"
I
hazarded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
worse
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
they
induce
you
to
entice
me
to
that
house
in
Lambeth
?
<EOS>
Why
did
they
so
evidently
desire
that
I
should
be
killed
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
accident
,
"
he
interrupted
,
correcting
me
.
"
<EOS>
Always
by
accident
,
"
and
he
smiled
grimly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
know
their
secret
motive
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
the
time
I
did
not
,
"
he
declared
.
<EOS>
"
I
acted
on
their
instructions
,
being
compelled
to
,
for
they
hold
my
future
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
could
not
disobey
.
<EOS>
You
knew
too
much
,
therefore
you
were
marked
down
for
death
--
just
as
you
are
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
it
who
is
now
seeking
my
life
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
returned
from
Russia
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
movements
are
well
known
,
"
answered
the
young
Italian
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
too
careful
.
<EOS>
Woodroffe
has
been
in
Russia
with
you
,
has
he
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
whereupon
he
said
:
 
"
I
thought
so
,
but
was
not
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
Chater
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
;
"
where
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
And
the
Leithcourts
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
of
ignorance
,
adding
:
"
The
Signorina
Muriel
returned
to
London
from
Eastbourne
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
can
I
find
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
I
should
see
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
with
a
relation
,
a
cousin
,
I
think
,
at
Bassett
Road
,
Notting
Hill
.
<EOS>
The
house
is
called
'
Holmwood
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
heard
she
had
returned
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
her
father
is
still
in
hiding
from
Chater
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
still
in
hiding
,
but
Chater
is
his
best
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
curious
,
"
I
remarked
,
recollecting
the
hurried
departure
from
Rannoch
.
<EOS>
"
They
've
made
it
up
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
never
quarreled
,
to
my
knowledge
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
why
did
Leithcourt
leave
Scotland
so
hurriedly
on
Chater
's
arrival
?
<EOS>
You
know
all
about
the
affair
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
nodded
,
saying
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
know
.
<EOS>
The
party
up
there
must
have
been
a
very
interesting
one
.
<EOS>
If
the
police
could
have
made
a
raid
on
the
place
they
would
have
found
among
the
guests
certain
persons
long
'
wanted
.
'
<EOS>
But
the
arrival
of
Chater
and
the
flight
of
Leithcourt
had
an
ulterior
object
.
<EOS>
Chater
had
never
been
Leithcourt
's
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
understand
that
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
Leithcourt
have
attacked
Chater
,
rendered
him
unconscious
,
and
shut
him
up
in
the
cupboard
in
the
library
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Was
it
Leithcourt
<EOS>
who
did
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
dubiously
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
It
was
another
of
the
guests
who
was
Chater
's
bitterest
enemy
.
<EOS>
But
Philip
Leithcourt
took
advantage
of
the
fracas
in
order
to
make
believe
that
he
had
fled
because
of
Chater
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
"
you
have
n't
any
idea
of
their
ruses
.
<EOS>
They
are
amazing
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
it
seems
,
"
I
said
,
nevertheless
only
half
convinced
that
the
Italian
was
telling
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
really
,
as
he
had
said
,
that
the
arrival
of
Chater
and
the
flight
was
merely
a
"
blind
,
"
then
the
mystery
was
again
deepened
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
who
was
the
man
who
attacked
Chater
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
Chater
himself
knows
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
guests
,
that
is
quite
evident
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
say
that
the
flight
had
been
prearranged
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
with
a
distinct
motive
,
"
he
said
;
then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
added
,
with
a
strange
,
earnest
look
in
his
dark
eyes
,
"
Pardon
me
,
Signor
Commendatore
,
if
I
presume
to
suggest
something
,
will
you
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
suggest
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
should
remain
here
,
in
this
hotel
,
and
not
venture
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
fear
of
something
unfortunate
happening
to
me
!
<EOS>
"
I
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
really
not
afraid
,
<EOS>
Olinto
,
"
I
added
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
carry
this
,
"
and
I
drew
out
my
revolver
from
my
hip
-
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
signore
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
might
not
be
afforded
opportunity
for
using
it
.
<EOS>
When
they
lay
a
trap
they
bait
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
They
're
a
set
of
the
most
ingenious
scoundrels
in
London
,
it
is
very
evident
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
do
n't
fear
them
in
the
least
,
"
I
declared
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
rescue
the
Signorina
Heath
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
signore
,
have
a
care
for
yourself
,
"
cried
the
Italian
,
laying
his
hand
upon
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
marked
man
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
do
I
not
know
,
"
he
exclaimed
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
go
out
you
may
run
right
into
--
well
,
the
fatal
accident
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
Olinto
,
"
I
said
reassuringly
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
keep
my
eyes
well
open
.
<EOS>
Here
,
in
London
,
one
's
life
is
safer
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
,
perhaps
--
certainly
safer
than
in
some
places
I
could
name
in
your
own
country
,
eh
?
"
at
which
he
grinned
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
he
grew
serious
again
,
and
said
:
 
"
I
only
warn
the
signore
that
if
he
goes
out
it
is
at
his
own
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
let
it
be
so
,
"
I
laughed
,
feeling
self
-
confident
that
no
one
could
lead
me
into
any
trap
.
<EOS>
I
was
neither
a
foreigner
nor
a
country
cousin
.
<EOS>
I
knew
London
too
well
.
<EOS>
He
was
silent
and
shook
his
head
;
then
,
after
telling
me
that
he
was
still
at
the
same
restaurant
in
Westbourne
Grove
,
he
took
his
departure
,
warning
me
once
more
not
to
go
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
,
disregarding
his
words
,
I
strode
out
into
the
Strand
,
and
again
walked
round
to
the
"
Junior
.
<EOS>
"
The
short
wintry
day
had
ended
,
the
gas
-
lamps
were
lit
,
and
the
darkness
of
night
was
gradually
creeping
on
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
had
not
been
to
the
club
,
and
I
began
now
to
grow
thoroughly
uneasy
.
<EOS>
He
had
parted
from
me
at
the
corner
of
the
Strand
with
only
a
five
minutes
'
walk
before
him
,
and
yet
he
had
apparently
disappeared
.
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
was
to
drive
to
Notting
Hill
to
inquire
of
Muriel
if
she
had
news
of
him
,
but
somehow
the
Italian
's
warning
words
made
me
wonder
if
he
had
met
with
foul
play
.
 
<EOS>
I
suddenly
recollected
those
two
men
who
had
passed
by
as
we
had
talked
,
and
how
that
the
features
of
one
had
seemed
strangely
familiar
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
took
a
cab
to
the
police
-
station
down
at
Whitehall
,
and
made
inquiry
of
the
inspector
on
duty
in
the
big
bare
office
with
its
flaring
gas
-
jets
in
wire
globes
.
<EOS>
He
heard
me
to
the
end
,
then
turning
back
the
book
of
"
occurrences
"
before
him
,
glanced
through
the
ruled
entries
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
this
is
the
gentleman
,
sir
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
And
he
read
to
me
the
entry
as
follows
:
 
<EOS>
"
P.C.
462A
reports
that
at
2.07
a.m.
,
while
on
duty
outside
the
National
Gallery
,
he
heard
a
revolver
shot
,
followed
by
a
man
's
cry
.
<EOS>
He
ran
to
the
corner
of
Suffolk
Street
,
where
he
found
a
gentleman
lying
upon
the
pavement
suffering
from
a
serious
shot
-
wound
in
the
chest
and
quite
unconscious
.
<EOS>
He
obtained
the
assistance
of
P.C.
's
218A
and
343A
,
and
the
gentleman
,
who
was
not
identified
,
was
taken
to
the
Charing
Cross
Hospital
,
where
the
house
-
surgeon
expressed
a
doubt
whether
he
could
live
.
<EOS>
Neither
P.C.
's
recollect
having
noticed
any
suspicious
-
looking
person
in
the
vicinity
.
                         
<EOS>
"
JOHN
PERCIVAL
,
_
Inspector
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
waited
for
no
more
,
but
rushed
round
to
the
hospital
in
the
cab
,
and
was
,
five
minutes
later
,
taken
along
the
ward
,
where
I
identified
poor
Jack
lying
in
bed
,
white
-
faced
and
unconscious
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
doctor
was
here
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
,
"
whispered
the
sister
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
fears
he
is
sinking
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
uttered
no
words
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
anxiously
.
"
<EOS>
Made
no
statement
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
.
<EOS>
He
has
never
regained
consciousness
,
and
I
fear
,
sir
,
he
never
will
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
case
of
deliberate
murder
,
the
police
told
me
early
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
clenched
my
fists
and
swore
a
fierce
revenge
for
that
dastardly
act
.
<EOS>
And
as
I
stood
beside
the
narrow
bed
,
I
realized
that
what
Olinto
had
said
regarding
my
own
peril
was
the
actual
truth
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
marked
man
.
<EOS>
Was
I
never
to

CHAPTER
XVII
 
<EOS>
THE
TRUTH
ABOUT
THE
"
LOLA
"
  
<EOS>
Throughout
the
long
night
I
called
many
times
at
the
hospital
,
but
the
reply
was
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
Jack
had
not
regained
consciousness
,
and
the
doctor
regarded
his
case
as
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
I
drove
in
hot
haste
to
Bassett
Road
,
Notting
Hill
,
and
at
the
address
<EOS>
Olinto
had
given
me
<EOS>
found
Muriel
.
<EOS>
When
she
entered
the
room
with
folding
doors
into
which
I
had
been
shown
,
I
saw
that
she
was
pale
and
apprehensive
,
for
we
had
not
met
since
her
flight
,
and
she
was
,
no
doubt
,
at
a
loss
for
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
press
her
for
one
.
<EOS>
I
merely
told
her
that
the
Italian
Santini
had
given
me
her
address
and
that
I
came
as
bearer
of
unfortunate
news
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
she
gasped
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
concerns
Captain
Durnford
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
injured
in
the
street
,
and
is
in
Charing
Cross
Hospital
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
explain
the
truth
.
<EOS>
By
your
face
I
can
tell
there
is
something
more
.
<EOS>
He
's
dead
!
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
worst
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
Leithcourt
,
"
I
said
gravely
,
"
not
dead
,
but
the
doctors
fear
that
he
may
not
recover
.
<EOS>
His
wound
is
dangerous
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
shot
by
some
unknown
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shot
!
"
<EOS>
she
echoed
,
bursting
into
tears
.
"
<EOS>
Then
they
have
followed
him
,
after
all
!
<EOS>
They
have
deceived
me
,
and
now
,
as
they
intend
to
take
him
from
me
,
I
will
myself
protect
him
.
<EOS>
You
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
have
been
in
peril
of
your
life
,
that
I
know
,
but
Jack
's
enemies
are
yours
,
and
they
shall
not
go
unpunished
.
<EOS>
May
I
see
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
,
but
we
will
ask
at
the
hospital
.
"
<EOS>
And
after
the
exchange
of
some
further
explanations
,
we
took
a
hansom
back
to
Charing
Cross
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
the
sister
refused
to
allow
Muriel
to
see
the
patient
,
but
she
implored
so
earnestly
that
at
last
she
consented
,
and
the
distressed
girl
in
the
black
coat
and
hat
crept
on
tiptoe
to
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
conscious
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
,
"
whispered
the
nurse
who
sat
there
,
"
He
asked
after
some
lady
named
Muriel
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
girl
at
my
side
burst
into
low
sobbing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
Muriel
is
here
--
that
she
has
seen
him
,
and
is
waiting
for
him
to
recover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
were
not
allowed
to
linger
there
,
and
on
leaving
the
hospital
I
took
her
back
again
to
Notting
Hill
,
promising
to
keep
her
well
informed
of
Jack
's
condition
.
<EOS>
He
had
returned
to
consciousness
,
therefore
there
was
now
a
faint
hope
for
his
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
Day
succeeded
day
,
and
although
I
was
not
allowed
to
visit
my
friend
,
I
was
told
that
he
was
very
slowly
progressing
.
<EOS>
I
idled
at
the
Hotel
Cecil
longing
daily
for
news
of
Elma
.
<EOS>
Only
once
did
a
letter
come
from
her
,
a
brief
,
well
-
written
note
from
which
it
appeared
that
she
was
quite
well
and
happy
,
although
she
longed
to
be
able
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
The
Princess
was
very
kind
indeed
to
her
,
and
,
she
added
,
was
making
secret
arrangements
for
her
escape
across
the
Russian
frontier
into
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
what
that
meant
.
<EOS>
Use
was
to
be
made
of
certain
Russian
officials
who
were
secretly
allied
with
the
Revolutionists
in
order
to
secure
her
safe
conduct
beyond
the
power
of
that
order
of
exile
of
the
tyrant
de
Plehve
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
her
under
cover
to
the
Princess
,
but
there
had
been
no
time
yet
for
a
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Muriel
many
times
,
but
never
once
did
she
refer
to
Rannoch
or
their
sudden
departure
.
<EOS>
Her
only
thought
was
of
the
man
she
loved
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
believed
that
you
were
engaged
to
Mr.
Woodroffe
,
"
I
said
one
day
,
when
I
called
to
tell
her
of
Jack
's
latest
bulletin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
that
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
,
"
she
responded
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
were
reasons
why
I
did
not
accept
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Reasons
connected
with
his
past
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
smiled
,
and
then
said
:
 
"
Ah
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
it
is
all
a
strange
and
very
tragic
story
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
Jack
.
<EOS>
When
do
you
think
they
will
allow
me
to
go
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
explained
that
the
doctor
feared
to
cause
the
patient
any
undue
excitement
,
but
that
in
two
or
three
days
there
was
hope
of
her
being
allowed
to
visit
him
.
<EOS>
Several
times
the
police
made
inquiry
of
me
,
but
I
could
tell
them
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
recollect
where
I
had
before
seen
the
face
of
that
man
who
had
passed
in
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
ten
days
after
the
attempt
upon
Jack
,
I
was
allowed
to
sit
by
his
bedside
and
question
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Gordon
,
old
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
faintly
,
"
I
've
had
a
narrow
escape
--
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
After
I
left
you
I
walked
quickly
on
towards
the
club
,
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
two
scoundrels
sprang
out
of
Suffolk
Street
,
and
one
of
them
fired
a
revolver
full
at
me
.
<EOS>
Then
I
knew
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
who
were
the
men
?
<EOS>
Did
you
recognize
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
worst
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
Muriel
knows
who
they
were
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
!
<EOS>
Bring
her
here
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
implored
,
"
I
'm
dying
to
see
her
once
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
I
told
him
how
she
had
looked
upon
him
while
unconscious
,
and
how
I
had
taken
the
daily
bulletin
to
her
.
<EOS>
For
an
hour
I
talked
with
him
,
urging
him
to
get
well
soon
,
so
that
we
could
unite
in
probing
the
mystery
,
and
bringing
to
justice
those
responsible
for
the
dastardly
act
.
 
<EOS>
"
Muriel
knows
,
and
if
she
loves
you
she
will
no
doubt
assist
us
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
does
love
me
,
Gordon
,
I
know
that
,
"
said
the
prostrate
man
,
smiling
contentedly
,
and
when
I
left
I
promised
to
bring
her
there
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
This
I
did
,
but
having
conducted
her
to
the
bed
at
the
end
of
the
ward
I
discreetly
withdrew
.
<EOS>
What
she
said
to
him
I
am
not
,
of
course
,
aware
.
<EOS>
All
I
know
is
that
an
hour
later
when
I
returned
I
found
them
the
happiest
pair
possible
to
conceive
,
and
I
clearly
saw
that
Jack
's
trust
in
her
was
not
ill
-
placed
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
Elma
?
<EOS>
No
further
word
had
come
from
her
,
and
I
began
to
grow
uneasy
.
<EOS>
The
days
went
on
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
twice
,
but
no
reply
was
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
could
bear
the
suspense
no
longer
,
and
began
to
contemplate
returning
to
Russia
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
when
at
last
discharged
from
the
hospital
,
came
across
to
the
Cecil
and
lived
with
me
in
preference
to
the
"
Junior
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
very
weak
at
first
,
and
I
looked
after
him
,
while
every
day
Muriel
came
and
ate
with
us
,
brightening
our
lives
by
her
smart
and
merry
chatter
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
I
loved
Elma
and
was
also
aware
of
the
exciting
events
in
Russia
,
Jack
having
told
her
of
them
during
their
long
drives
in
hansoms
when
he
went
out
with
her
to
take
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
I
received
a
brief
note
from
the
Princess
in
Petersburg
,
urging
me
to
remain
patient
and
saying
Elma
was
quite
safe
and
well
.
<EOS>
There
were
reasons
,
however
,
why
she
was
unable
to
write
,
she
added
.
<EOS>
What
were
they
,
I
wondered
?
<EOS>
Yet
I
could
only
wait
until
I
received
word
to
travel
back
to
Russia
and
fetch
her
home
.
<EOS>
The
Princess
had
promised
to
arrange
everything
.
 
<EOS>
December
came
,
and
we
still
remained
on
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
Once
Olinto
had
written
me
repeating
his
warning
,
but
I
did
not
heed
it
.
<EOS>
I
somehow
distrusted
the
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
now
thoroughly
recovered
,
called
almost
daily
at
Bassett
Road
,
and
would
often
bring
Muriel
to
the
Cecil
to
tea
or
to
luncheon
.
<EOS>
Often
I
inquired
the
whereabouts
of
her
father
and
of
Hylton
Chater
,
but
she
declared
herself
in
entire
ignorance
,
and
believed
they
were
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
shortly
before
Christmas
,
as
we
were
idling
in
the
American
bar
of
the
hotel
,
my
friend
told
me
that
Muriel
had
invited
us
to
tea
at
her
cousin
's
that
afternoon
,
and
accordingly
we
went
there
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
The
drawing
-
room
into
which
we
were
ushered
was
familiar
to
me
as
the
apartment
wherein
I
had
told
Muriel
of
the
attempt
upon
her
lover
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
sat
together
Muriel
,
a
smart
figure
in
a
pale
blue
gown
,
poured
tea
for
us
and
chatted
more
merrily
,
I
thought
,
than
ever
before
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
quick
and
nervous
and
yet
full
of
happiness
,
as
she
should
indeed
have
been
,
for
Jack
Durnford
was
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
,
and
his
restoration
to
health
little
short
of
miraculous
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gordon
,
"
he
said
to
me
with
a
sudden
seriousness
when
tea
had
ended
and
we
had
placed
down
our
cups
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
you
something
--
something
I
've
been
longing
always
to
tell
you
,
and
now
I
have
got
dear
Muriel
's
consent
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
tell
you
about
her
father
and
his
friends
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
about
Elma
,
too
?
"
I
said
in
quick
eagerness
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
tell
me
everything
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
everything
,
for
I
do
n't
know
it
myself
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
know
I
will
explain
as
briefly
as
I
can
,
and
leave
you
to
form
your
own
conclusions
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
a
strange
--
most
amazing
story
.
<EOS>
When
I
myself
became
first
cognizant
of
the
mystery
I
was
on
board
the
flagship
the
_
Renown
_
,
under
Admiral
Sir
John
Fisher
.
<EOS>
We
were
lying
in
Malta
when
there
arrived
the
English
yacht
_
Iris
_
,
owned
by
Mr.
Philip
Leithcourt
,
and
among
those
on
board
cruising
for
pleasure
were
Mr.
Martin
Woodroffe
,
Mr.
Hylton
Chater
,
and
the
owner
's
wife
and
daughter
Muriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Muriel
and
I
met
first
at
a
tennis
-
party
,
and
afterwards
frequently
at
various
houses
in
Malta
,
for
anyone
who
goes
there
and
entertains
is
soon
entertained
in
return
.
<EOS>
A
mutual
attachment
sprang
up
between
Muriel
and
myself
,
"
he
said
,
placing
his
hand
tenderly
upon
hers
and
smiling
,
"
and
we
often
met
in
secret
and
took
long
walks
,
<EOS>
until
quite
suddenly
Leithcourt
said
that
it
was
necessary
to
sail
for
Smyrna
to
pick
up
some
friends
who
had
been
traveling
in
Palestine
.
<EOS>
The
night
they
sailed
a
great
consternation
was
caused
on
the
island
by
the
news
that
the
safe
in
the
Admiral
Superintendent
's
office
had
been
opened
by
expert
safe
-
breakers
,
and
certain
most
important
secret
documents
stolen
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
I
asked
,
much
interested
.
 
<EOS>
"
Again
,
two
months
later
,
when
the
villa
of
the
Prince
of
Montevachi
,
at
Palmero
,
was
broken
into
and
the
whole
of
the
famous
jewels
of
the
Princess
stolen
,
it
was
a
very
strange
fact
that
the
_
Iris
_
was
at
the
moment
in
that
port
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
until
the
third
occasion
,
when
the
yacht
was
at
Villefranche
,
and
our
squadron
being
at
Toulon
<EOS>
I
got
four
days
'
leave
to
go
along
the
Riviera
,
that
my
suspicions
were
aroused
,
for
at
the
very
hour
when
I
was
dining
at
the
London
House
at
Nice
with
Muriel
and
a
schoolfellow
of
hers
,
Elma
Heath
--
who
was
spending
the
winter
there
with
a
lady
who
was
Baron
Oberg
's
cousin
--
that
a
great
robbery
was
committed
in
one
of
the
big
hotels
up
at
Cimiez
,
the
wife
of
an
American
millionaire
losing
jewels
valued
at
thirty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Then
the
robberies
,
coincident
with
the
visit
of
the
yacht
,
aroused
my
strong
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
remarked
the
nature
of
those
documents
stolen
from
Malta
,
and
recognized
that
they
could
only
be
of
service
to
a
foreign
government
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
Leghorn
incident
of
which
you
told
me
.
<EOS>
The
yacht
's
name
had
been
changed
to
the
_
Lola
_
,
and
she
had
been
repainted
.
<EOS>
I
made
searching
inquiry
,
and
found
that
on
the
evening
she
was
purposely
run
aground
in
order
to
strike
up
a
friendship
at
the
Consulate
,
a
Russian
gunboat
was
lying
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
The
Consul
's
safe
was
rifled
,
and
the
scheme
certainly
was
to
transfer
anything
obtained
from
it
to
the
Russian
gunboat
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
was
in
the
safe
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fortunately
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
they
knew
that
our
squadron
was
due
in
Leghorn
,
and
that
some
extremely
important
despatches
were
on
the
way
to
the
Admiral
--
secret
orders
based
upon
the
decision
of
the
British
Cabinet
as
to
the
vexed
question
of
Russian
ships
passing
the
Dardanelles
--
they
expected
that
they
would
be
lodged
in
the
safe
until
the
arrival
of
the
squadron
,
as
they
always
are
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
however
,
bitterly
disappointed
because
the
despatches
had
not
arrived
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
then
?
"
 
"
Well
,
the
only
Russian
who
appeared
to
have
any
connection
with
them
was
Baron
Oberg
,
the
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
,
whose
habit
it
was
to
spend
part
of
the
winter
in
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
From
Elma
Heath
's
conversation
at
dinner
that
evening
at
Nice
<EOS>
I
gathered
that
she
and
her
uncle
had
been
guests
on
the
_
Iris
_
on
several
occasions
,
although
I
must
say
that
Muriel
was
extremely
reticent
regarding
all
that
concerned
the
yacht
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
she
said
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Now
that
I
have
told
you
the
truth
,
Jack
,
do
n't
you
think
it
was
only
natural
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
certainly
,
dear
,
"
he
answered
,
still
holding
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Yours
was
not
a
secret
that
you
could
very
well
tell
to
me
until
you
could
thoroughly
trust
me
,
especially
as
your
father
had
been
implicated
in
the
theft
of
those
documents
from
Malta
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
"
he
said
,
turning
to
me
,
"
Philip
Leithcourt
has
all
along
been
the
catspaw
of
Baron
Oberg
.
<EOS>
A
few
years
ago
he
was
a
well
-
known
money
-
lender
in
the
city
,
and
in
that
capacity
met
the
Baron
,
who
,
being
in
disgrace
,
required
a
loan
.
<EOS>
He
was
also
in
the
habit
of
having
certain
shady
transactions
with
that
daring
gang
of
continental
thieves
of
whom
Dick
Archer
and
Hylton
Chater
were
leaders
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
he
purchased
a
yacht
for
their
use
,
so
that
they
might
not
only
use
it
for
the
purpose
of
storing
the
stolen
goods
,
but
for
the
purpose
of
sailing
from
place
to
place
under
the
guise
of
wealthy
Englishmen
traveling
for
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Upon
that
vessel
,
indeed
,
was
stored
thousands
and
thousands
of
pounds
'
worth
of
jewels
and
objects
of
value
,
the
proceeds
of
many
great
robberies
in
England
,
France
and
Belgium
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
traveled
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
the
jewels
in
various
inland
towns
where
the
gems
,
having
been
recut
,
were
not
recognized
,
while
at
other
times
,
Chater
and
Archer
,
assisted
by
Mackintosh
,
the
captain
,
and
Olinto
Santini
,
the
steward
,
sailed
for
a
port
,
landed
,
committed
a
robbery
,
and
then
sailed
away
again
,
quite
unsuspected
,
as
rich
Englishmen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
crew
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
,
of
course
,
well
paid
,
and
were
kept
in
ignorance
of
what
the
supposed
owner
and
his
friends
did
ashore
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
Oberg
's
connection
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
surprised
at
those
revelations
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Muriel
.
<EOS>
"
The
ingenuity
of
that
crafty
villain
is
fiendish
.
<EOS>
Before
he
got
into
the
Czar
's
favor
he
owed
my
father
a
large
sum
,
and
then
sought
how
to
evade
repayment
.
<EOS>
By
means
of
his
spies
he
discovered
the
real
purpose
of
the
cruises
of
the
_
<EOS>
Iris_--for
<EOS>
I
was
often
taken
on
board
with
a
maid
in
order
to
allay
any
suspicion
that
might
arise
if
only
men
were
cruising
.
<EOS>
Then
he
not
only
compelled
my
father
to
cancel
the
debt
,
but
he
impressed
the
vessel
and
those
who
owned
and
navigated
it
into
the
secret
service
of
Russia
.
<EOS>
A
dozen
times
did
we
make
attempts
to
obtain
secret
papers
from
Italian
,
French
and
English
dockyards
,
but
only
once
in
the
case
of
Malta
and
once
at
Toulon
did
we
succeed
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
she
added
,
"
you
do
not
know
all
the
anxiety
I
suffered
,
how
at
every
hour
we
were
in
danger
of
betrayal
or
capture
,
and
of
the
hundred
narrow
escapes
we
have
had
of
Custom
House
officers
rummaging
the
yacht
for
contraband
.
<EOS>
You
will
no
doubt
recollect
the
sensation
caused
by
the
theft
of
the
jewels
of
the
Princess
Wilhelmine
of
Schaumbourg
-
Lippe
from
the
lady's
-
maid
in
the
rapide
between
Cannes
and
Les
Arcs
,
the
robbery
from
the
Marseilles
branch
of
the
Credit
Lyonnais
,
and
the
great
haul
of
plate
from
the
chateau
of
Bardon
,
the
Paris
millionaire
,
close
to
Arcachon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
for
they
were
all
robberies
of
which
I
had
read
in
the
newspapers
a
couple
of
years
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
she
said
,
"
they
were
all
committed
by
Archer
or
Woodroffe
and
his
gang
--
with
accomplices
ashore
,
of
course
--
and
never
once
did
it
seem
that
any
suspicion
fell
upon
us
.
<EOS>
While
the
police
were
frantically
searching
hither
and
thither
,
we
used
to
weigh
anchor
and
calmly
steam
away
with
our
booty
on
board
.
<EOS>
We
had
with
us
an
old
Dutch
lapidary
,
and
one
of
the
cabins
was
fitted
as
a
workshop
,
where
he
altered
the
appearance
of
the
stones
,
and
prepared
them
ready
for
sale
,
while
the
gold
was
melted
in
a
crucible
and
put
ashore
to
be
sent
to
agents
in
Hamburg
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
that
night
in
Leghorn
?
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
happened
to
poor
Elma
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
was
Muriel
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
both
on
board
together
,
and
standing
at
the
crack
of
the
door
watched
you
sitting
at
dinner
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Elma
told
me
that
she
believed
that
there
was
a
plot
against
your
life
,
but
why
she
would
not
tell
me
.
<EOS>
She
evidently
knew
of
the
proposed
rifling
of
the
safe
at
the
Consulate
.
<EOS>
Oberg
himself
was
also
on
board
,
locked
in
his
own
cabin
.
<EOS>
Elma
must
have
overheard
some
conversation
between
the
Baron
and
one
of
the
others
,
for
she
was
in
great
fear
the
whole
time
lest
they
might
injure
you
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
seemed
,
after
all
,
as
though
their
idea
was
the
same
as
always
,
to
worm
themselves
into
your
confidence
.
<EOS>
The
instant
,
however
,
you
went
ashore
,
Chater
,
Woodroffe
--
whom
you
called
Hornby
--
and
Mackintosh
,
the
captain
--
who
,
by
the
way
,
was
an
old
ticket
-
of
-
leave
man
--
went
ashore
,
and
,
of
course
,
broke
into
the
Consulate
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
soon
as
they
returned
,
Elma
came
to
my
cabin
,
awoke
me
,
and
said
that
the
Baron
was
taking
her
ashore
,
and
that
they
were
to
travel
overland
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
She
was
ready
dressed
to
go
,
therefore
I
kissed
her
,
and
promising
to
meet
her
soon
,
we
parted
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
last
I
saw
of
her
.
<EOS>
What
happened
to
her
afterwards
<EOS>
only
she
alone
can
tell
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
she
is
not
the
Baron
's
niece
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
There
is
some
mystery
,
"
declared
Muriel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
holds
some
secret
which
he
fears
she
may
divulge
.
<EOS>
But
of
what
nature
,
I
am
in
ignorance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
say
that
your
father
has
never
taken
any
active
part
in
the
robberies
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
He
commenced
by
lending
money
,
and
amassed
a
considerable
fortune
.
<EOS>
Then
avarice
seized
him
,
as
it
does
so
many
men
,
and
coming
into
contact
with
Archer
and
his
friends
<EOS>
,
he
saw
that
the
idea
of
the
yacht
was
a
safe
and
profitable
one
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
purchased
the
vessel
,
and
ran
it
at
the
disposition
of
the
thieves
,
and
subsequently
under
compulsion
in
the
secret
service
of
Russia
,
as
I
have
already
described
to
you
.
<EOS>
The
profits
were
colossal
.
<EOS>
In
one
year
my
father
's
share
was
eighty
thousand
pounds
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
where
is
your
father
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
sadly
,
her
face
pale
and
haggard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
that
the
vessel
was
scuttled
somewhere
in
the
Baltic
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
true
.
<EOS>
Oberg
's
purpose
having
been
served
,
he
demanded
half
the
property
on
board
,
or
he
would
give
notice
to
the
Russian
naval
authorities
that
the
pirate
yacht
was
afloat
.
<EOS>
He
attempted
to
blackmail
my
father
,
as
he
had
already
done
so
many
times
,
but
his
scheme
was
frustrated
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
because
of
his
inhuman
treatment
of
poor
Elma
,
defied
him
,
when
it
appears
that
Oberg
,
who
was
in
Helsingfors
,
telegraphed
to
the
admiral
of
the
Russian
fleet
in
the
Baltic
.
<EOS>
The
crew
from
the
_
Iris
_
were
at
once
landed
at
Riga
,
and
only
Mackintosh
and
my
father
put
to
sea
again
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
father
was
desperate
,
for
he
knew
the
merciless
character
of
that
man
whose
victim
he
had
been
for
so
long
.
<EOS>
They
watched
a
Russian
cruiser
bearing
down
upon
them
,
when
,
just
as
it
drew
near
,
they
got
off
in
a
boat
and
blew
up
the
yacht
,
which
sank
in
three
minutes
with
its
ill
-
obtained
wealth
on
board
.
"
 
"
<EOS>
And
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
silent
,
and
I
saw
tears
standing
in
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
tragedy
,
"
Jack
explained
in
a
low
,
hoarse
voice
.
"
<EOS>
He
and
the
captain
did
not
,
unfortunately
,
get
sufficiently
far
from
the
yacht
when
they
blew
her
up
,
and
they
went
down
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
looked
in
silence
at
Muriel
,
who
stood
with
her
head
bent
and
her
white
face
covered
with
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
same
moment
there
was
a
low
tap
at
the
door
,
and
the
servant
-
maid
announced
:
 
"
Mr.
Santini
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Jack
quickly
,
as
Olinto
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
had
my
note
!
<EOS>
We
have
asked
you
here
to
reveal
to
us
this
dastardly
plot
which
seemed
to
have
been
formed
against
Mr.
Gregg
and
myself
.
<EOS>
As
you
know
,
I
've
had
a
narrow
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
signore
.
<EOS>
And
the
Signor
Commendatore
is
also
threatened
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
whom
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
those
who
killed
my
poor
wife
,
and
who
intended
also
to
silence
me
,
"
was
his
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
same
who
compelled
you
take
me
to
that
house
<EOS>
where
the
fatal
chair
was
prepared
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
Archer
,
who
,
fearing
that
you
came
to
London
in
search
of
them
,
devised
that
devilish
contrivance
,
"
he
said
in
his
broken
English
.
<EOS>
Then
continuing
,
he
went
on
fiercely
:
"
<EOS>
Now
that
I
have
discovered
why
my
poor
Armida
was
killed
,
I
will
tell
the
truth
,
and
not
spare
them
.
<EOS>
Since
you
left
Scotland
,
signore
,
I
have
been
up
in
Dumfries
,
and
have
discovered
several
facts
which
prove
that
for
some
reason
known
only
to
himself
,
Leithcourt
,
while
at
Rannoch
,
wrote
to
both
Armida
and
myself
separately
,
making
an
appointment
to
see
us
at
the
same
time
at
that
spot
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
as
he
had
some
secret
commission
to
entrust
to
us
.
<EOS>
The
letter
addressed
to
me
apparently
fell
into
someone
else
's
hands
--
probably
one
of
the
secret
agents
of
Baron
Oberg
,
who
were
always
watching
Leithcourt
's
doings
,
and
he
,
anxious
to
learn
what
was
intended
,
made
himself
up
to
look
like
me
,
and
kept
the
appointment
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
Armida
,
having
received
the
letter
unknown
to
me
,
went
up
to
Scotland
,
and
was
also
there
at
the
appointed
time
.
<EOS>
What
actually
transpired
can
only
be
surmised
,
yet
it
seems
that
Leithcourt
was
in
the
habit
of
going
up
to
that
spot
and
loitering
there
in
the
evening
in
order
to
meet
Chater
in
secret
,
as
the
latter
was
in
hiding
in
a
small
hotel
in
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
Therefore
those
who
formed
the
plot
must
have
endeavored
to
throw
suspicion
upon
Leithcourt
.
<EOS>
It
is
plain
,
however
,
as
both
myself
and
Armida
knew
the
gang
,
it
was
to
their
interest
to
get
rid
of
us
,
because
the
suspicions
of
the
police
had
at
last
become
aroused
.
<EOS>
Poor
Armida
was
therefore
deliberately
enticed
there
to
her
death
,
while
the
inquisitive
man
whom
the
assassin
took
to
be
myself
was
also
struck
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
whom
?
"
 
"
Not
by
Chater
,
for
he
was
in
London
on
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
by
Woodroffe
?
"
<EOS>
Durnford
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
most
cleverly
thought
out
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
his
advantage
alone
to
close
our
lips
,
because
in
that
same
fatal
chair
in
Lambeth
old
Jacob
Moser
,
the
Jew
bullion
-
broker
of
Hatton
Garden
,
met
his
death
--
a
most
dastardly
crime
,
with
which
none
of
his
friends
were
associated
,
and
of
which
we
alone
held
knowledge
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
wrote
to
us
as
though
from
Leithcourt
,
calling
us
up
to
Rannoch
,
in
order
to
strike
the
blows
in
the
darkness
,
"
he
added
in
his
peculiar
Italian
manner
.
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
feared
we
would
tell
the
signore
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
told
the
police
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
,
signore
.
<EOS>
Surely
the
less
the
police
know
about
this
matter
the
better
,
otherwise
the
Signorina
Leithcourt
must
suffer
for
her
father
's
avarice
and
evil
-
doing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
cried
Jack
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
Olinto
.
<EOS>
The
police
must
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
reprisals
we
must
make
ourselves
.
<EOS>
But
who
was
it
who
shot
me
in
Suffolk
Street
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
same
man
,
Martin
Woodroffe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
the
assassin
is
back
from
Russia
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
followed
closely
behind
the
Signor
Commendatore
.
<EOS>
Markoff
,
a
clever
secret
agent
of
Baron
Oberg
's
,
came
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
for
the
first
time
I
recollected
that
the
man
I
had
recognized
in
the
Strand
was
a
fellow
I
had
seen
lounging
in
the
ante
-
room
of
the
palace
of
the
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
.
<EOS>
The
pair
,
fearing
that
I
should
reveal
what
I
knew
,
were
undoubtedly
in
London
to
take
my
life
in
secret
.
<EOS>
Now
that
Leithcourt
was
dead
,
Woodroffe
had
united
forces
with
Oberg
,
and
intended
to
silence
me
because
they
feared
that
Elma
,
besides
escaping
them
,
had
also
revealed
her
secret
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
that
the
Signorina
Leithcourt
has
explained
the
story
of
the
yacht
and
its
crew
,
"
Olinto
remarked
.
"
<EOS>
And
has
also
shown
you
how
I
was
implicated
.
<EOS>
You
will
therefore
discern
the
reason
why
I
have
hitherto
feared
to
give
you
any
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
Miss
Leithcourt
has
told
me
a
great
deal
,
but
not
everything
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
yet
gather
for
what
reason
she
and
her
father
fled
from
Rannoch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
tell
you
,
"
said
Muriel
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
suspected
Woodroffe
of
being
the
assassin
in
Rannoch
Wood
,
for
he
knew
that
he
had
broken
away
from
the
original
compact
,
and
had
now
allied
himself
with
Oberg
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
also
my
father
's
object
to
appear
in
fear
of
them
,
because
he
was
only
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
lay
plans
for
poor
Elma
's
rescue
from
Finland
.
<EOS>
Therefore
one
evening
Woodroffe
called
,
and
my
father
encountered
him
in
the
avenue
,
and
admitted
him
with
his
own
latchkey
by
one
of
the
side
doors
of
the
castle
,
afterwards
taking
him
up
to
the
study
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
had
come
to
try
and
make
terms
for
Oberg
,
therefore
he
saw
that
he
must
fly
at
once
to
Newcastle
,
where
the
_
Iris
_
was
lying
,
get
on
board
,
and
sail
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
some
excuse
he
left
him
in
the
study
,
and
then
warned
my
mother
and
myself
to
prepare
to
leave
.
<EOS>
But
while
we
were
packing
,
it
appeared
that
Chater
,
who
had
followed
,
was
shown
into
the
study
by
the
butler
,
or
rather
he
entered
there
himself
,
being
well
acquainted
with
the
house
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
two
men
,
now
bitter
enemies
,
met
.
<EOS>
A
fierce
quarrel
must
have
ensued
,
and
Chater
was
poisoned
and
concealed
,
Woodroffe
,
of
course
,
believing
he
had
killed
him
.
<EOS>
My
father
entered
the
study
again
,
and
seeing
only
Woodroffe
there
,
did
not
know
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Some
words
probably
arose
,
when
my
father
again
turned
and
left
.
<EOS>
Then
we
fled
to
Carlisle
and
on
to
Newcastle
,
and
next
morning
were
on
board
the
yacht
out
in
the
North
Sea
,
afterwards
landing
at
Rotterdam
.
<EOS>
Those
,
"
she
added
,
"
are
briefly
the
facts
,
as
my
poor
father
related
them
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
of
poor
Elma
--
and
of
her
secret
?
<EOS>
When
,
I
wonder
,
shall
I
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
her
now
,
signore
,
"
answered
Olinto
.
<EOS>
"
A
servant
of
the
Princess
Zurloff
brought
her
to
London
this
afternoon
,
and
I
have
just
conveyed
her
from
the
station
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
the
next
room
,
in
ignorance
,
however
,
that
you
are
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
without
another
word
I
fled
forward
joyfully
,
and
threw
open
the
folding
-
doors
which
separated
me
from
my
silent
love
.
 
<EOS>
Silent
,
yes
!
<EOS>
But
she
could
,
nevertheless
,
tell
her
story
--
surely
the
strangest
that
any
woman
has
ever
lived
to
tell
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVIII
 
<EOS>
CONTAINS
ELMA
'S
<EOS>
STORY
  
<EOS>
Before
me
stood
my
love
,
a
slim
,
tragic
,
rather
wan
figure
in
a
heavy
dark
traveling
-
coat
and
felt
toque
,
her
sweet
lips
parted
and
a
look
of
bewildered
amazement
upon
her
countenance
as
I
burst
in
so
suddenly
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
In
silence
I
grasped
her
tiny
black
-
gloved
hand
,
and
then
,
also
in
silence
,
raised
it
passionately
to
my
eager
lips
.
<EOS>
Her
soft
,
dark
eyes
--
those
eyes
that
spoke
although
she
was
mute
--
met
mine
,
and
in
them
was
a
look
that
I
had
never
seen
there
before
--
a
look
which
as
plainly
as
any
words
told
me
that
my
wild
fevered
passion
was
reciprocated
.
 
<EOS>
She
gazed
beyond
into
the
room
where
the
others
had
assembled
,
and
then
looked
at
me
inquiringly
<EOS>
,
whereupon
I
led
her
forward
to
where
they
were
,
and
Muriel
fell
upon
her
and
kissed
her
with
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
prepared
this
surprise
for
you
,
Mr.
Gregg
,
"
Muriel
said
,
laughing
through
her
tears
of
joy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Olinto
learnt
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
London
,
and
I
sent
him
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
The
Princess
has
managed
magnificently
,
has
she
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
she
is
free
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
induce
her
to
tell
us
everything
.
"
 
<EOS>
Muriel
was
already
helping
my
love
out
of
her
heavy
Russian
coat
,
a
costly
garment
lined
with
sable
,
and
when
,
after
greeting
Jack
and
Olinto
,
she
was
comfortably
seated
,
I
took
some
notepaper
from
the
little
writing
-
table
by
the
window
and
scribbled
in
pencil
the
words
:
 
"
I
need
not
write
how
delighted
I
am
that
you
are
safe
<EOS>
--
that
the
Almighty
has
heard
my
prayers
for
you
.
<EOS>
Jack
and
Muriel
have
told
me
all
about
Leithcourt
and
his
scoundrelly
associates
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
too
,
dear
--
for
I
may
call
you
that
,
may
I
not?--how
terribly
you
must
have
suffered
in
silence
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
Leithcourt
is
dead
.
<EOS>
He
sank
the
yacht
with
all
the
stolen
property
on
board
,
but
by
accident
was
himself
engulfed
.
"
 
<EOS>
Bending
and
watching
intently
as
I
wrote
,
she
drew
back
in
horror
and
surprise
at
the
words
.
<EOS>
Then
I
added
:
"
We
are
all
four
determined
that
the
guilty
shall
not
go
unpunished
,
and
that
the
affliction
placed
upon
you
shall
be
adequately
avenged
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
own
love
--
I
am
bold
enough
to
call
you
so
.
<EOS>
Some
strong
but
mysterious
bond
of
affinity
between
us
caused
me
to
seek
you
out
,
and
your
pictured
face
seemed
to
call
me
to
your
side
although
I
was
unaware
of
your
peril
.
<EOS>
I
was
sent
to
you
by
the
unseen
power
to
extricate
you
from
the
hands
of
your
enemies
.
<EOS>
Therefore
tell
us
everything
--
all
that
you
know
--
without
fear
,
for
now
that
we
are
united
no
harm
can
assail
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
took
the
pencil
,
and
holding
it
in
her
white
fingers
sat
staring
first
at
us
,
and
then
looking
hesitatingly
at
the
white
paper
before
her
.
<EOS>
Her
position
,
amid
a
hundred
conflicting
emotions
,
was
one
of
extreme
difficulty
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
even
now
she
was
loth
to
reveal
to
us
the
absolute
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Muriel
,
standing
behind
her
chair
,
tenderly
stroked
back
the
wealth
of
chestnut
hair
from
her
white
brow
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
was
perfect
,
even
though
her
face
was
pale
and
jaded
,
and
her
eyes
heavy
,
consequent
upon
her
long
,
weary
journey
from
the
now
frozen
North
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
when
by
signs
both
Jack
and
Olinto
had
urged
her
to
write
,
she
bent
suddenly
,
and
her
pencil
began
to
run
swiftly
over
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
All
of
us
stood
exchanging
glances
in
silence
,
neither
looking
over
her
,
but
each
determined
to
wait
in
patience
until
the
end
.
<EOS>
Once
started
,
however
,
she
did
not
pause
.
<EOS>
Sheet
after
sheet
she
covered
.
<EOS>
The
silence
for
a
long
time
was
complete
,
broken
only
by
the
rapid
running
of
the
pencil
over
the
rough
surface
of
the
paper
.
<EOS>
She
had
apparently
become
seized
by
a
sudden
determination
to
explain
everything
,
now
that
she
saw
we
were
in
real
,
dead
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
I
watched
her
sweet
face
bent
so
intently
,
and
as
the
firelight
fell
across
it
found
it
incomparable
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
she
was
afflicted
by
loss
of
speech
,
it
was
true
,
yet
she
was
surely
inexpressibly
sweet
and
womanly
,
peerless
above
all
others
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
deep
-
drawn
sigh
<EOS>
she
at
last
finished
,
and
,
her
head
still
bowed
in
an
attitude
of
humiliation
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
,
she
handed
what
she
had
written
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
breathless
eagerness
I
read
as
follows
:
 
"
Is
it
true
,
dear
love
--
<EOS>
for
I
call
you
so
in
return
--
that
you
were
impelled
towards
me
by
the
mysterious
hand
that
directs
all
things
?
<EOS>
You
came
in
search
of
me
,
and
you
risked
your
life
for
mine
at
Kajana
,
therefore
you
have
a
right
to
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
You
,
as
my
champion
,
and
the
Princess
as
my
friend
,
have
contrived
to
effect
my
freedom
.
<EOS>
Were
it
not
for
you
,
I
should
ere
this
have
been
on
my
way
to
Saghalien
,
to
the
tomb
to
which
Oberg
had
so
ingeniously
contrived
to
consign
me
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
--
you
never
can
know
--
all
that
I
have
suffered
ever
since
I
was
a
girl
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
statement
broke
off
,
and
recommenced
as
follows
:
 
<EOS>
"
In
order
that
you
should
understand
the
truth
,
I
had
better
begin
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
an
English
merchant
in
Petersburg
,
and
my
mother
,
Vera
Bessanoff
,
who
,
before
her
marriage
with
my
father
,
was
celebrated
at
Court
for
her
beauty
,
and
was
one
of
the
maids
-
of
-
honor
to
the
Czarina
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
only
daughter
of
Count
Paul
Bessanoff
,
ex
-
Governor
of
Kharkoff
,
and
before
marrying
my
father
she
had
,
with
her
mother
,
been
a
well
-
known
figure
in
society
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
her
marriage
her
father
died
,
leaving
her
in
possession
of
an
ample
fortune
,
which
,
with
my
father
's
own
wealth
,
placed
them
among
the
richest
and
most
influential
in
Petersburg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Among
my
father
's
most
intimate
friends
was
Baron
Xavier
Oberg
--
who
,
at
that
time
,
held
a
very
subordinate
position
in
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
--
and
from
my
earliest
recollections
I
can
remember
him
coming
frequently
to
our
house
and
being
invited
to
the
brilliant
entertainments
which
my
mother
gave
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
thirteen
,
however
,
my
father
died
of
a
chill
contracted
while
boar
-
hunting
on
his
estate
in
Kiev
,
and
within
a
few
months
a
further
disaster
happened
to
us
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
while
I
was
sitting
alone
reading
aloud
to
my
mother
,
two
strangers
were
announced
,
and
on
being
shown
in
they
arrested
my
dear
mother
on
a
charge
of
complicity
in
a
revolutionary
plot
against
the
Czar
which
had
been
discovered
at
Peterhof
.
<EOS>
I
stood
defiant
and
indignant
,
for
my
mother
was
certainly
no
Nihilist
,
yet
they
said
that
the
bomb
had
been
introduced
into
the
palace
by
the
Countess
Anna
Shiproff
,
one
of
the
ladies
-
in
-
waiting
,
who
was
an
intimate
friend
of
my
mother
's
and
often
used
to
visit
her
.
<EOS>
They
alleged
that
the
conspiracy
had
been
hatched
in
our
house
,
color
being
lent
to
that
theory
by
the
fact
that
a
year
before
a
well
-
known
Russian
with
whom
my
father
had
had
many
business
dealings
had
been
proved
to
be
the
author
of
the
plot
by
which
the
Czar
's
train
was
blown
up
near
Lividia
.
<EOS>
They
tore
my
mother
away
from
me
and
placed
her
in
that
gray
prison
-
van
,
the
sight
of
which
in
the
streets
of
Petersburg
strikes
terror
into
the
heart
of
every
Russian
,
for
a
person
once
in
that
rumbling
vehicle
is
,
as
you
know
,
lost
for
ever
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
watched
her
from
the
window
being
placed
in
that
fatal
conveyance
,
and
then
I
think
I
must
have
fainted
,
for
I
recollect
nothing
more
until
I
found
myself
upon
the
floor
,
with
the
gray
dawn
spreading
,
and
all
the
horrible
truth
came
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
mother
was
gone
from
me
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
"
In
sheer
desperation
I
went
to
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
and
sought
an
interview
with
the
Baron
,
who
,
when
I
told
him
of
the
disaster
,
appeared
greatly
concerned
,
and
went
at
once
to
the
Police
Department
to
make
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
however
,
he
came
to
me
with
the
news
that
the
charge
against
my
mother
had
been
proved
by
a
statement
of
the
woman
Shiproff
herself
,
and
that
she
had
already
started
on
her
long
journey
to
Siberia
--
she
had
been
exiled
to
one
of
those
dreaded
Arctic
settlements
beyond
Yakutsk
,
a
place
where
it
is
almost
eternal
winter
,
and
where
the
conditions
of
life
are
such
that
half
the
convicts
are
insane
.
<EOS>
The
Baron
,
however
,
declared
that
,
as
my
father
's
friend
,
it
was
his
duty
to
act
as
guardian
to
me
,
and
that
as
my
father
had
been
English
I
ought
to
be
put
to
an
English
school
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
with
his
self
-
assumed
title
of
uncle
,
he
took
me
to
Chichester
.
<EOS>
For
years
I
remained
there
,
until
one
day
he
came
suddenly
and
fetched
me
away
,
taking
me
over
to
Helsingfors
--
for
the
Czar
had
now
appointed
him
Governor
-
General
to
Finland
.
<EOS>
There
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
introduced
me
to
his
son
Michael
,
a
pimply
-
faced
lieutenant
of
cavalry
,
and
said
in
a
most
decisive
manner
that
I
must
marry
him
.
<EOS>
I
naturally
refused
to
marry
a
man
of
whom
I
knew
so
little
,
whereupon
,
finding
me
obdurate
,
he
quickly
altered
his
tactics
and
became
kindness
itself
,
saying
that
as
I
was
young
he
would
allow
me
a
year
in
which
to
make
up
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
week
later
,
while
living
in
the
palace
at
Helsingfors
,
I
overheard
a
conversation
between
the
Governor
-
General
and
his
son
,
which
revealed
to
me
a
staggering
truth
that
I
had
never
suspected
.
<EOS>
It
was
Oberg
himself
who
had
denounced
my
mother
to
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
,
and
had
made
those
cruel
,
baseless
charges
against
her
!
<EOS>
Then
I
discerned
the
reason
.
<EOS>
She
being
exiled
,
her
fortune
,
as
well
as
that
of
my
father
,
came
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
reason
they
were
scheming
for
Michael
to
marry
me
was
in
order
to
obtain
control
of
my
money
.
<EOS>
I
saw
at
once
how
helpless
I
was
in
the
hands
of
that
unscrupulous
pair
,
and
I
recognized
,
too
,
sufficient
of
the
Baron
's
methods
as
'
The
Strangler
of
Finland
,
'
to
show
me
what
kind
of
character
he
was
beneath
that
calm
,
eminently
respectable
black
-
coated
exterior
.
<EOS>
After
deliberately
sending
my
poor
mother
to
Siberia
,
he
had
assumed
the
role
of
my
guardian
in
order
that
he
might
,
when
I
came
of
age
,
obtain
control
of
my
inheritance
,
the
idea
no
doubt
being
that
I
should
marry
Michael
,
and
then
,
after
the
necessary
legal
formalities
,
I
should
,
on
a
trumped
-
up
charge
of
conspiracy
,
share
the
same
fate
as
my
mother
had
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
infernal
scoundrel
!
<EOS>
"
I
ejaculated
,
when
I
read
her
words
,
while
from
Jack
,
who
had
been
looking
over
my
shoulder
,
escaped
a
fierce
and
forcible
vow
of
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Baron
took
me
with
him
to
Petersburg
when
he
went
on
official
business
,
and
we
remained
there
nearly
a
month
,
"
the
narrative
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
While
there
I
received
a
secret
message
from
'
The
Red
Priest
,
'
the
unseen
and
unknown
power
of
Nihilism
,
who
has
for
so
many
years
baffled
the
police
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
see
him
,
and
he
revealed
to
me
how
Oberg
had
contrived
to
have
my
mother
banished
upon
a
false
charge
.
<EOS>
He
warned
me
against
the
man
who
had
pretended
to
be
my
father
's
friend
,
and
also
told
me
that
he
had
known
my
father
intimately
,
and
that
if
I
got
into
any
further
difficulty
I
was
to
communicate
with
him
and
he
would
assist
me
.
<EOS>
Oberg
took
me
back
to
Helsingfors
a
few
months
later
,
and
in
summer
we
went
to
England
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
marvelously
clever
diplomatist
.
<EOS>
His
tactics
he
could
change
at
will
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
at
school
he
was
rough
and
brutal
in
his
manner
towards
me
,
as
he
was
to
all
;
but
now
he
seemed
to
be
endeavoring
to
inspire
my
confidence
by
treating
me
with
kindly
regard
and
pleasant
affability
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
London
,
at
Claridge
's
,
we
met
my
old
schoolfellow
Muriel
and
her
father
--
a
friend
of
Oberg's
--
and
in
response
to
their
invitation
went
for
a
cruise
on
their
yacht
,
the
_
Iris
_
,
from
Southampton
.
<EOS>
Our
party
was
a
very
pleasant
one
,
and
included
Woodroffe
and
Chater
,
while
our
cruise
across
the
Bay
of
Biscay
and
along
the
Portuguese
coast
proved
most
delightful
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
while
we
were
lying
outside
Lisbon
,
Woodroffe
and
Chater
,
together
with
Olinto
,
went
ashore
,
and
when
they
returned
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
they
awoke
me
by
crossing
the
deck
above
my
head
.
<EOS>
Then
I
heard
someone
outside
my
cabin
-
door
working
as
though
with
a
screwdriver
,
unscrewing
a
screw
from
the
woodwork
.
<EOS>
This
aroused
my
interest
,
and
next
day
I
made
a
minute
examination
of
the
paneling
,
<EOS>
where
,
in
one
part
,
I
found
two
small
brass
screws
that
had
evidently
been
recently
removed
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
succeeded
in
getting
hold
of
a
screwdriver
from
the
carpenter
's
shop
,
and
next
night
,
when
everyone
was
asleep
,
I
crept
out
and
unscrewed
the
panel
,
<EOS>
when
to
my
surprise
I
saw
that
the
secret
cavity
behind
was
filled
with
beautiful
jewelry
,
diamond
collars
,
tiaras
,
necklets
,
fine
pearls
,
emeralds
and
turquoises
,
all
_
thrown
_
in
indiscriminately
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
replaced
the
panel
and
kept
careful
watch
.
<EOS>
At
Marseilles
,
where
we
called
,
more
jewelry
and
a
heavy
bagful
of
plate
was
brought
aboard
and
secreted
behind
another
panel
.
<EOS>
Then
I
knew
that
the
men
were
thieves
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
surely
,
"
continued
the
strange
story
my
mute
love
had
written
,
"
I
need
not
describe
all
that
occurred
upon
that
eventful
voyage
,
except
to
tell
you
of
one
very
curious
incident
which
occurred
.
<EOS>
I
had
spoken
confidentially
with
Muriel
regarding
my
suspicions
of
the
men
who
were
our
fellow
-
guests
,
and
when
in
secret
I
showed
her
several
places
on
board
the
yacht
where
valuables
were
secreted
,
she
also
became
convinced
that
the
men
were
expert
thieves
to
whom
her
father
,
for
some
unexplained
reason
,
rendered
assistance
and
asylum
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
that
since
she
had
left
school
she
had
been
on
quite
a
number
of
cruises
,
and
that
the
same
party
always
accompanied
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
however
,
never
suspected
the
truth
until
I
pointed
it
out
to
her
.
<EOS>
Well
,
one
hot
summer
's
night
we
were
lying
off
Naples
,
and
as
it
was
a
grand
festa
ashore
and
there
was
to
be
a
gala
performance
at
the
theater
,
Leithcourt
took
a
box
and
the
whole
party
were
rowed
ashore
.
<EOS>
The
crew
were
also
given
shore
-
leave
for
the
evening
,
but
as
the
great
heat
had
upset
me
<EOS>
I
declined
to
accompany
the
theater
-
party
,
and
remained
on
board
with
one
sailor
named
Wilson
to
constitute
the
watch
.
<EOS>
We
had
anchored
about
half
a
mile
from
land
,
and
earlier
in
the
evening
the
Baron
had
gone
ashore
to
send
telegrams
to
Russia
,
and
had
not
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
ten
o'clock
I
went
below
to
try
and
sleep
,
but
I
had
a
slight
attack
of
fever
,
and
was
unable
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
redressed
and
sat
with
the
light
still
out
,
gazing
across
the
starlit
bay
.
<EOS>
Presently
from
my
port
-
hole
I
saw
a
shore
-
boat
approaching
,
and
recognized
in
it
the
Baron
with
a
well
-
dressed
stranger
.
<EOS>
They
both
came
on
board
,
and
the
boatman
,
having
been
paid
,
pulled
back
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Baron
and
his
friend
--
a
dark
,
middle
-
aged
,
full
-
bearded
man
,
evidently
a
person
of
refinement
--
went
below
to
the
saloon
,
and
after
a
few
moments
called
to
the
man
Wilson
who
was
on
the
watch
,
and
gave
him
a
glass
of
whisky
and
water
,
which
he
took
up
on
deck
to
drink
at
his
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
unusual
character
of
my
fellow
-
guests
on
board
that
craft
was
such
that
my
suspicion
was
constantly
on
the
alert
,
therefore
curiosity
tempted
me
to
creep
along
and
peep
in
at
the
crack
of
the
door
standing
ajar
.
<EOS>
A
closer
view
revealed
the
fact
that
the
stranger
was
a
high
Russian
official
to
whom
I
had
once
been
introduced
at
the
Government
Palace
at
Helsingfors
,
the
Privy
-
Councillor
and
Senator
Paul
Polovstoff
.
<EOS>
They
were
smoking
together
,
and
were
discussing
in
Russian
the
means
by
which
he
,
Polovstoff
,
had
arranged
to
obtain
plans
of
some
new
British
fortifications
at
Gibraltar
.
<EOS>
From
what
he
said
,
it
seemed
that
some
Russian
woman
,
married
to
an
Englishman
,
a
captain
in
the
garrison
,
had
been
impressed
into
the
secret
service
against
her
will
,
but
that
she
had
,
in
order
to
save
herself
,
promised
to
obtain
the
photographs
and
plans
that
were
required
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
Englishman
's
name
,
and
I
resolved
to
take
some
steps
to
inform
him
in
secret
of
the
intentions
of
the
Russian
agent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Presently
the
two
men
took
fresh
cigars
,
ascended
on
deck
,
and
cast
themselves
in
the
long
cane
chairs
amidships
.
<EOS>
Still
all
curiosity
to
hear
further
details
on
the
ingenious
piece
of
espionage
against
my
own
nation
,
I
took
off
my
shoes
and
crept
up
to
a
spot
where
I
could
crouch
concealed
and
overhear
their
conversation
,
for
the
Italian
night
was
calm
and
still
.
<EOS>
They
talked
mainly
about
affairs
in
Finland
,
and
with
some
of
Oberg
's
expressions
of
opinion
Polovstoff
ventured
to
differ
.
<EOS>
This
aroused
the
Baron
's
anger
,
and
I
knew
from
the
cold
sarcasm
of
his
remarks
,
and
the
peculiarly
hard
tone
of
his
voice
,
that
he
was
more
incensed
than
he
outwardly
showed
himself
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
rose
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
bulwarks
facing
his
friend
,
who
still
sat
leaning
back
in
his
deck
-
chair
insisting
upon
his
own
views
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
calm
,
and
not
in
the
least
perturbed
by
the
evil
glint
in
the
Baron
's
eye
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
did
not
know
him
so
well
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
what
that
look
meant
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
while
the
Privy
-
Councillor
lay
back
in
his
chair
pulling
thoughtfully
at
his
cigar
,
there
was
a
bright
,
blood
-
red
flash
,
a
dull
report
,
and
a
man
's
short
agonized
cry
.
<EOS>
Startled
,
I
leaned
around
the
corner
of
the
deck
-
house
,
when
,
to
my
abject
horror
,
I
saw
under
the
electric
rays
the
Czar
's
Privy
-
Councillor
lying
sideways
in
his
chair
with
part
of
his
face
blown
away
.
<EOS>
Then
the
hideous
truth
in
an
instant
became
apparent
.
<EOS>
The
cigar
which
Oberg
had
pressed
upon
him
down
in
the
saloon
had
exploded
,
and
the
small
missile
concealed
inside
the
diabolical
contrivance
had
passed
upwards
into
his
brain
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
I
stood
utterly
stupefied
,
yet
as
I
looked
<EOS>
I
saw
the
Baron
,
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
,
shake
his
fist
in
the
dead
man
's
face
,
and
cry
with
a
fearful
imprecation
:
'
<EOS>
You
hound
!
<EOS>
You
have
plotted
to
replace
me
in
the
Czar
's
favor
.
<EOS>
You
intended
to
become
Governor
-
General
of
Finland
!
<EOS>
You
knew
certain
facts
which
you
intended
to
put
before
his
Majesty
,
knowing
that
the
revelations
would
result
in
my
disgrace
and
downfall
.
<EOS>
But
,
you
infernal
cur
,
you
did
not
know
that
those
who
attempt
to
thwart
Xavier
Oberg
either
die
by
accident
or
go
for
life
to
Kajana
or
the
mines
!
'
<EOS>
And
he
spurned
the
body
with
his
foot
and
laughed
to
himself
as
he
gloated
over
his
dastardly
crime
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
watched
his
rage
,
unable
to
utter
a
single
word
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
,
after
he
had
searched
the
dead
man
's
pockets
,
raise
the
inert
body
with
its
awful
featureless
face
and
drag
it
to
the
bulwarks
.
<EOS>
Then
I
rushed
forward
and
faced
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
an
instant
he
sprang
at
me
,
and
I
screamed
.
<EOS>
But
no
aid
came
.
<EOS>
The
man
Wilson
was
sleeping
soundly
in
the
bows
,
for
the
whisky
he
had
given
him
had
been
doctored
,
"
went
on
the
narrative
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
his
face
was
a
fierce
,
murderous
look
such
as
I
had
never
seen
before
.
'
You
!
'
<EOS>
he
screamed
,
his
dark
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
as
he
realized
that
I
had
been
a
witness
of
his
cowardly
crime
.
'
<EOS>
You
have
spied
upon
me
,
girl
!
'
<EOS>
he
hissed
,
'
and
you
shall
die
also
!
'
<EOS>
I
sank
upon
my
knees
imploring
him
to
spare
me
,
but
he
only
laughed
at
my
entreaty
.
'
<EOS>
See
!
'
<EOS>
he
cried
,
'
as
you
saw
how
he
enjoyed
his
cigar
,
you
may
as
well
see
this
!
'
<EOS>
And
with
an
effort
he
raised
the
dead
body
in
his
arms
,
poised
it
for
a
moment
on
the
vessel
's
side
,
and
then
,
with
a
hoarse
laugh
of
triumph
,
heaved
it
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
splash
,
and
then
we
were
alone
.
'
<EOS>
And
you
!
'
<EOS>
he
cried
in
a
fierce
voice--'you
who
have
spied
upon
me
--
you
will
follow
!
<EOS>
The
water
there
will
close
your
chattering
mouth
!
'
<EOS>
I
shrieked
,
begged
,
and
implored
,
but
his
trembling
hands
were
upon
my
throat
.
<EOS>
First
he
dragged
me
to
my
feet
,
then
he
threw
me
upon
my
knees
,
and
at
last
,
with
that
grim
brutality
which
characterizes
him
,
he
directed
me
to
go
and
get
a
mop
and
bucket
from
the
forecastle
and
remove
the
dark
red
stains
from
the
chair
and
deck
.
<EOS>
This
he
actually
forced
me
to
do
,
gloating
over
my
horror
as
I
removed
for
him
the
traces
of
his
cowardly
crime
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
he
said
,
'
Girl
!
<EOS>
Recollect
that
you
keep
to
-
night
's
work
secret
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
you
shall
die
a
death
more
painful
than
that
dog
has
died
--
one
in
which
you
shall
experience
all
the
tortures
of
the
damned
.
<EOS>
Recollect
,
not
a
single
word
--
or
death
!
<EOS>
Now
,
go
to
your
cabin
,
and
never
pry
into
my
affairs
again
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
went
back
to
my
cabin
as
I
was
bid
,
and
sat
speechless
in
abject
horror
.
<EOS>
The
fiendish
actions
of
the
man
who
was
my
guardian
frightened
me
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
was
utterly
helpless
.
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
Who
in
holy
Russia
would
hear
me
?
<EOS>
Oberg
was
a
power
in
the
Empire
;
the
Czar
himself
trusted
him
.
<EOS>
If
I
spoke
,
who
would
believe
me
;
who
would
heed
the
words
of
a
defenseless
girl
whom
he
would
at
once
declare
to
be
hysterical
?
<EOS>
Thus
I
waited
alone
in
the
darkness
,
watching
the
lights
of
the
port
gleaming
across
the
placid
waters
until
nearly
one
o'clock
,
when
the
gay
party
returned
,
and
the
Baron
greeted
them
merrily
as
though
nothing
had
happened
.
<EOS>
But
my
heart
was
frozen
within
me
by
the
recollection
of
the
awful
crime
that
had
been
committed
.

<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
Now
I
remember
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Muriel
,
amazed
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
night
quite
well
,
how
white
you
were
when
you
came
to
my
cabin
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
sleep
in
my
spare
berth
.
<EOS>
You
would
tell
me
nothing
,
and
only
said
you
were
ill
.
<EOS>
None
of
us
had
any
idea
that
such
a
terrible
tragedy
had
been
enacted
.
<EOS>
But
of
course
the
Baron
had
arranged
it
all
,
for
it
was
at
his
instigation
,
I
recollect
,
that
the
crew
had
been
given
shore
-
leave
.
<EOS>
Mackintosh
suggested
that
only
half
the
crew
should
go
,
but
he
declared
that
if
Wilson
alone
were
left
it
would
be
sufficient
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
too
,
recollect
the
affair
quite
well
,
"
Jack
declared
,
tugging
at
his
mustache
,
utterly
amazed
at
my
love
's
strange
story
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
plain
statement
of
hard
,
astounding
facts
,
and
she
now
stood
clinging
to
me
,
looking
eagerly
into
my
eyes
,
reading
every
thought
that
passed
through
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
A
great
sensation
was
caused
when
the
body
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
The
squadron
was
lying
off
Naples
about
a
week
after
the
_
Iris
_
had
left
,
and
while
we
were
there
the
body
was
washed
up
near
Sorrento
.
<EOS>
At
first
but
little
notice
was
taken
of
it
,
but
by
the
marks
on
the
dead
man
's
linen
it
was
discovered
that
he
was
Polovstoff
,
one
of
the
highest
Russian
officials
who
had
<EOS>
,
it
was
said
,
been
warned
on
several
occasions
by
the
Nihilists
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
concluded
that
his
death
had
been
due
to
Nihilist
vengeance
.
"
 
<EOS>
Elma
pointed
to
the
paper
,
and
made
a
sign
that
I
was
to
read
on
.
<EOS>
This
I
did
,
and
the
statement
ran
as
follows
:
 
<EOS>
"
The
real
reason
why
the
Baron
spared
my
life
was
because
,
if
I
died
,
my
fortune
would
pass
to
a
distant
cousin
living
at
Durham
.
<EOS>
Yet
his
manner
towards
me
was
now
most
polite
and
pleasant
--
a
change
that
I
felt
boded
no
good
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
obtain
my
money
by
marrying
me
to
his
son
Michael
,
whose
evil
reputation
as
a
gambler
was
well
known
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
We
traveled
back
to
Finland
in
the
autumn
,
and
in
the
winter
he
took
me
to
stay
with
his
sister
in
Nice
.
<EOS>
Yet
almost
daily
he
referred
to
that
tragedy
at
Naples
,
and
threatened
me
with
death
if
ever
I
uttered
a
single
word
,
or
even
admitted
that
I
had
ever
seen
the
man
who
was
his
rival
and
his
victim
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Last
June
,
"
commenced
another
paragraph
,
"
we
were
in
Helsingfors
,
when
one
day
the
Baron
called
me
suddenly
and
told
me
to
prepare
for
a
journey
.
<EOS>
We
were
to
cross
to
Stockholm
and
thence
to
Hull
,
where
the
_
Iris
_
was
awaiting
us
,
for
Mr.
Leithcourt
and
Muriel
had
invited
us
for
a
summer
cruise
to
the
Greek
Islands
.
<EOS>
We
boarded
the
yacht
much
against
my
will
,
yet
I
was
powerless
,
and
dare
not
allege
the
facts
that
I
had
already
established
concerning
our
fellow
-
guests
.
<EOS>
Muriel
and
I
,
it
seems
,
were
taken
merely
in
order
to
blind
the
shore
-
guards
and
Customs
officials
as
to
the
real
nature
of
the
vessel
,
which
when
safely
out
of
the
Channel
,
was
repainted
and
renamed
the
_
Lola
_
,
until
her
exterior
presented
quite
a
different
appearance
from
the
_
Iris
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
port
of
Leghorn
was
our
first
place
of
call
,
and
for
some
reason
we
ran
purposely
upon
a
sandbank
and
were
towed
off
by
Italian
torpedo
-
boats
.
<EOS>
Next
evening
you
came
on
board
and
dined
,
Muriel
and
myself
having
strict
orders
not
to
show
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
,
however
,
watched
you
,
and
I
saw
you
pick
up
my
photograph
<EOS>
which
I
had
that
day
torn
up
.
<EOS>
Then
immediately
after
you
had
left
,
Woodroffe
,
Chater
and
Mackintosh
went
ashore
and
were
away
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Just
before
they
returned
the
Baron
rapped
at
the
door
of
my
cabin
saying
that
he
must
go
ashore
,
and
telling
me
to
dress
and
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
allow
me
the
luxury
of
a
maid
,
fearing
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
that
she
might
learn
too
much
.
<EOS>
In
obedience
I
rose
and
dressed
,
and
when
I
went
forth
he
told
me
to
get
my
traveling
-
cloak
and
dressing
-
bag
,
adding
that
he
was
compelled
to
go
north
,
as
to
continue
the
cruise
would
occupy
too
much
time
.
<EOS>
He
was
due
back
at
his
official
duties
,
he
said
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
had
finished
packing
,
the
three
men
returned
to
the
vessel
,
all
of
them
looking
dark
-
faced
and
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Woodroffe
whispered
some
words
to
the
Baron
,
after
which
I
went
to
Muriel
's
cabin
and
wished
her
good
-
bye
,
and
we
went
ashore
,
taking
the
train
first
to
Colle
Salvetti
,
thence
to
Pisa
,
and
afterwards
to
the
beautiful
old
city
of
Siena
,
which
I
had
so
longed
to
see
.
<EOS>
One
of
my
teeth
gave
me
pain
,
and
the
Baron
,
after
a
couple
of
days
at
the
Hotel
de
Sienne
,
took
me
to
a
queer
-
looking
little
old
Italian
--
a
dentist
who
,
he
said
,
enjoyed
an
excellent
reputation
.
<EOS>
I
was
quick
to
notice
that
the
two
men
had
met
before
,
and
as
I
sat
in
the
chair
and
gas
was
given
to
me
<EOS>
I
saw
them
exchange
meaning
glances
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
I
became
insensible
,
but
when
I
awoke
an
hour
later
I
was
astounded
to
feel
a
curious
soreness
in
my
ears
.
<EOS>
My
tongue
,
too
,
seemed
paralyzed
,
and
in
a
few
moments
the
awful
truth
dawned
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
rendered
deaf
and
dumb
!
 
<EOS>
"
The
Baron
pretended
to
be
greatly
concerned
about
me
,
"
it
went
on
,
"
but
I
quickly
realized
that
I
had
been
the
victim
of
a
foul
and
dastardly
plot
,
and
that
he
had
conceived
it
,
fearing
lest
I
might
speak
the
truth
concerning
the
Privy
-
Councillor
Polovstoff
,
for
of
exposure
he
lived
in
constant
fear
.
<EOS>
To
encompass
my
end
would
be
against
his
own
interests
,
as
he
would
lose
my
fortune
,
so
he
had
silenced
me
lest
I
should
reveal
the
terrible
truth
concerning
both
him
and
his
associates
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
rich
,
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
from
time
to
time
he
gave
information
as
to
persons
who
possessed
valuable
jewels
,
and
thus
shared
in
the
plunder
obtained
by
those
on
the
yacht
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
Italy
we
traveled
on
to
Berlin
,
thence
to
Petersburg
,
and
back
to
dreary
Helsingfors
,
journeying
as
quickly
as
we
could
,
yet
never
allowing
me
opportunity
of
being
with
strangers
.
<EOS>
Both
my
ears
and
tongue
were
very
painful
,
but
I
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
was
surely
a
fiend
in
a
black
coat
,
and
my
only
thought
now
was
how
to
escape
him
.
<EOS>
From
the
moment
when
that
so
-
called
dentist
had
ruined
my
hearing
and
deprived
me
of
power
of
speech
,
he
kept
me
aloof
from
everyone
.
<EOS>
The
fear
that
I
should
reveal
everything
had
apparently
grown
to
haunt
him
,
and
he
had
conceived
that
terrible
mode
of
silencing
my
lips
.
<EOS>
But
the
true
depth
of
his
villainy
was
not
yet
apparent
until
I
was
back
in
Finland
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
night
of
our
arrival
he
called
in
his
son
,
who
had
traveled
with
us
from
Petersburg
,
and
in
writing
again
demanded
that
I
should
marry
him
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
my
reply
--
a
firm
refusal
.
<EOS>
He
struck
the
table
angrily
with
his
fist
and
wrote
saying
that
I
should
either
marry
his
son
or
die
.
<EOS>
Then
next
day
,
while
walking
alone
out
beyond
the
town
of
Helsingfors
,
as
I
often
used
to
do
,
I
was
arrested
upon
the
false
charge
of
an
attempt
upon
the
life
of
Madame
Vakuroff
and
transported
,
without
trial
,
to
the
terrible
fortress
of
Kajana
,
some
of
the
horrors
of
which
you
have
yourself
experienced
.
<EOS>
The
charge
against
me
was
necessary
before
I
could
be
incarcerated
there
,
but
once
within
,
it
was
the
scheme
of
the
Governor
-
General
to
obtain
my
consent
to
the
marriage
by
threats
and
by
the
constant
terrors
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
even
went
so
far
as
to
obtain
a
ministerial
order
for
my
banishment
to
Saghalien
and
brought
it
to
me
to
Kajana
,
declaring
that
if
in
one
month
I
did
not
consent
he
should
allow
me
to
be
sent
to
exile
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
in
Kajana
he
knew
that
his
secret
was
safe
,
therefore
by
every
means
in
his
power
he
urged
me
to
consent
to
the
odious
union
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
the
rest
is
known
to
you
--
how
Providence
directed
you
to
me
as
my
deliverer
,
and
how
Woodroffe
followed
you
in
secret
,
and
pretending
to
be
my
friend
took
me
with
him
to
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
He
had
learnt
of
my
fortune
from
the
Baron
,
and
intended
to
marry
me
himself
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
all
is
over
it
appears
to
me
like
some
terrible
dream
.
<EOS>
I
never
believed
that
so
much
iniquity
existed
in
the
world
,
or
that
men
could
fight
a
defenseless
woman
with
such
double
-
dealing
and
cruel
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
tortures
I
endured
in
Kajana
are
beyond
human
conception
.
<EOS>
Yet
surely
Oberg
and
Woodroffe
will
obtain
their
well
-
merited
deserts
--
if
not
in
this
world
,
then
in
the
world
to
come
.
<EOS>
Are
we
not
taught
by
Holy
Writ
to
forgive
our
enemies
?
<EOS>
Therefore
,
let
us
forgive
.

<EOS>
There
my
silent
love
's
strange
story
ended
.
<EOS>
A
bald
,
straightforward
narrative
that
held
us
all
for
some
moments
absolutely
speechless
--
one
of
the
strangest
and
most
startling
stories
ever
revealed
.
 
<EOS>
She
watched
every
expression
of
my
countenance
,
and
then
,
when
I
had
finished
reading
and
placed
my
arm
tenderly
about
her
slim
waist
,
she
raised
her
beautiful
face
to
mine
to
receive
the
passionate
kiss
I
imprinted
upon
those
soft
,
full
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
,
of
course
,
makes
everything
plain
,
"
exclaimed
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Polovstoff
was
a
very
liberal
-
minded
and
upright
official
who
was
greatly
in
the
favor
of
the
Czar
,
and
a
serious
rival
to
Oberg
,
whose
drastic
and
merciless
methods
in
Finland
were
not
exactly
approved
by
the
Emperor
.
<EOS>
The
Baron
was
well
aware
of
this
,
and
by
ingeniously
enticing
him
on
board
<EOS>
the
_
Iris
_
he
succeeded
by
handing
that
small
bomb
concealed
in
a
cigar
--
a
Nihilist
contrivance
that
had
probably
been
seized
by
his
police
in
Finland
--
in
freeing
himself
from
the
rival
who
was
destined
to
occupy
his
post
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
mystery
is
cleared
up
,
it
is
true
,
yet
my
poor
Elma
is
still
the
victim
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
kissed
my
love
passionately
again
and
again
upon
the
lips
.
    
<EOS>
CONCLUSION
  
Nearly
two
years
have
now
gone
by
.
 
<EOS>
There
have
been
changes
in
holy
Russia
--
many
great
and
amazing
changes
consequent
upon
war
and
its
disasters
.
<EOS>
Russia
is
no
longer
the
great
power
that
she
once
was
supposed
to
be
.
<EOS>
Many
events
that
have
startled
the
world
have
occurred
since
that
day
when
I
first
enfolded
my
silent
love
within
my
arms
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
is
known
to
you
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
read
in
the
newspapers
,
without
a
doubt
,
how
the
Baron
Xavier
Oberg
,
the
persecutor
of
Finland
,
the
enemy
of
education
,
the
relentless
foe
of
the
defenseless
,
the
man
who
ordered
women
to
be
knouted
to
death
in
Kajana
,
the
heartless
official
whom
the
Finns
called
"
The
Strangler
,
"
was
blown
to
pieces
by
a
bomb
thrown
beneath
his
carriage
as
he
drove
to
the
railway
station
at
Helsingfors
on
his
way
to
have
audience
with
the
Emperor
.
 
<EOS>
The
secret
truth
was
that
the
"
Red
Priest
"
decreed
that
Oberg
should
die
,
and
the
plot
was
swiftly
put
into
execution
,
and
although
five
hundred
arrests
were
made
the
police
are
unaware
to
this
day
of
the
identity
of
the
person
who
directed
it
,
or
of
who
threw
the
fatal
missile
.
<EOS>
From
pillar
to
post
the
revolutionists
have
been
hunted
by
the
bloodhounds
of
police
,
yet
the
"
Red
Priest
"
still
lives
on
quietly
in
Petersburg
,
and
the
Princess
Zurloff
,
still
unsuspected
,
devotes
the
greater
part
of
her
enormous
income
to
the
cause
of
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
Of
Jack
and
Muriel
<EOS>
I
need
<EOS>
only
say
they
were
married
about
three
months
after
Elma
's
return
from
Russia
,
and
at
the
present
time
they
are
living
on
the
outskirts
of
Glasgow
,
where
Jack
has
secured
the
shore
appointment
which
he
so
long
coveted
.
 
<EOS>
By
some
means
--
exactly
how
is
not
quite
certain
--
the
police
discovered
that
Dick
Archer
,
alias
Woodroffe
,
alias
Hornby
,
was
concerned
in
the
clever
robbery
of
a
dressing
-
bag
,
containing
the
Dowager
Lady
Lancashire
's
jewels
,
from
her
footman
on
Euston
platform
,
and
after
a
long
search
they
found
him
hiding
at
an
hotel
in
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
When
,
however
,
they
went
to
arrest
him
,
he
laughed
in
the
faces
of
the
detectives
,
placed
something
swiftly
in
his
mouth
and
swallowed
it
before
they
could
prevent
him
--
then
ten
minutes
later
he
fell
dead
.
<EOS>
He
knew
what
terrible
revelations
must
be
made
if
we
gave
evidence
against
him
,
and
he
therefore
preferred
death
by
his
own
hand
to
that
following
a
judicial
sentence
.

Chater
,
although
one
of
the
most
expert
jewel
thieves
in
Europe
,
had
never
been
actually
guilty
of
any
graver
offense
,
and
when
we
heard
that
he
was
in
San
Francisco
,
where
he
had
opened
a
small
bar
and
was
trying
to
live
honestly
,
we
resolved
to
allow
him
to
remain
there
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Jack
wrote
to
him
about
nine
months
ago
warning
him
never
to
set
foot
on
English
soil
again
on
pain
of
arrest
.

Olinto
Santini
has
recently
opened
a
small
restaurant
in
Western
Road
,
Brighton
,
and
is
,
I
believe
,
doing
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
And
ourselves
!
<EOS>
Well
,
what
can
I
really
tell
you
?
<EOS>
Mere
words
fail
to
tell
you
of
the
completeness
of
our
happiness
.
<EOS>
It
is
idyllic
--
that
is
all
I
can
say
.
 
<EOS>
My
proposal
of
marriage
was
made
to
Elma
a
very
few
days
after
she
wrote
down
her
startling
and
romantic
story
,
and
a
year
ago
at
a
little
village
church
in
Hertfordshire
we
became
man
and
wife
,
there
being
present
at
our
wedding
Madame
Heath
,
my
bride
's
mother
,
to
whom
,
by
my
exertions
in
official
quarters
in
Petersburg
,
the
Czar
's
clemency
was
extended
,
and
she
was
released
from
that
far
-
off
Arctic
prison
to
which
she
had
been
sent
with
such
cruel
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
Two
of
the
greatest
London
specialists
have
continually
treated
my
dear
wife
,
and
under
them
she
has
already
recovered
her
speech
--
so
far
,
indeed
,
that
she
can
now
whisper
in
a
low
,
soft
voice
.
<EOS>
But
they
tell
me
they
are
hopeful
that
ere
<EOS>
long
her
voice
will
become
stronger
,
and
speech
practically
restored
.
<EOS>
Already
,
too
,
she
can
begin
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
After
all
the
storms
and
perils
of
the
past
,
our
lives
are
now
indeed
full
of
a
calm
,
sweet
peace
.
<EOS>
In
our
own
comfortable
little
house
,
with
its
trellised
porch
covered
with
roses
and
honeysuckle
,
that
faces
the
blue
Channel
at
St.
Margaret
's
Bay
,
beyond
Dover
,
we
lead
a
life
of
mutual
trust
and
boundless
love
.
<EOS>
We
are
supremely
content
--
the
happiest
pair
in
all
the
world
,
we
think
.
 
<EOS>
Often
as
we
sit
together
at
evening
,
gazing
out
upon
the
great
ships
passing
darkly
away
into
the
mysterious
afterglow
,
our
hands
clasp
mutually
in
a
silence
more
eloquent
than
words
,
and
as
we
gaze
into
each
other
's
eyes
there
occurs
to
us
the
Divine
injunction
:
"
<EOS>
WHOM
GOD
HATH
JOINED
,
LET
NO
MAN
PUT
ASUNDER
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
THE
END
