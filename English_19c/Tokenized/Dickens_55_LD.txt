Sun
and
Shadow
 
<EOS>
Thirty
years
ago
,
Marseilles
lay
burning
in
the
sun
,
one
day
.
   
<EOS>
A
blazing
sun
upon
a
fierce
August
day
was
no
greater
rarity
in
southern
France
then
,
than
at
any
other
time
,
before
or
since
.
<EOS>
Everything
in
Marseilles
,
and
about
Marseilles
,
had
stared
at
the
fervid
sky
,
and
been
stared
at
in
return
,
until
a
staring
habit
had
become
universal
there
.
 
<EOS>
Strangers
were
stared
out
of
countenance
by
staring
white
houses
,
staring
white
walls
,
staring
white
streets
,
staring
tracts
of
arid
road
,
staring
hills
from
which
verdure
was
burnt
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
things
to
be
seen
not
fixedly
staring
and
glaring
were
the
vines
drooping
under
their
load
of
grapes
.
 
<EOS>
These
did
occasionally
wink
a
little
,
as
the
hot
air
barely
moved
their
faint
leaves
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
wind
to
make
a
ripple
on
the
foul
water
within
the
harbour
,
or
on
the
beautiful
sea
without
.
 
<EOS>
The
line
of
demarcation
between
the
two
colours
,
black
and
blue
,
showed
the
point
which
the
pure
sea
would
not
pass
;
but
it
lay
as
quiet
as
the
abominable
pool
,
with
which
it
never
mixed
.
 
<EOS>
Boats
without
awnings
were
too
hot
to
touch
;
ships
blistered
at
their
moorings
;
the
stones
of
the
quays
had
not
cooled
,
night
or
day
,
for
months
.
 
<EOS>
Hindoos
,
Russians
,
Chinese
,
Spaniards
,
Portuguese
,
Englishmen
,
Frenchmen
,
Genoese
,
Neapolitans
,
Venetians
,
Greeks
,
Turks
,
descendants
from
all
the
builders
of
Babel
,
come
to
trade
at
Marseilles
,
sought
the
shade
alike
---
taking
refuge
in
any
hiding
-
place
from
a
sea
too
intensely
blue
to
be
looked
at
,
and
a
sky
of
purple
,
set
with
one
great
flaming
jewel
of
fire
.
   
<EOS>
The
universal
stare
made
the
eyes
ache
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
the
distant
line
of
Italian
coast
,
indeed
,
it
was
a
little
relieved
by
light
clouds
of
mist
,
slowly
rising
from
the
evaporation
of
the
sea
,
but
it
softened
nowhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
Far
away
the
staring
roads
,
deep
in
dust
,
stared
from
the
hill
-
side
,
stared
from
the
hollow
,
stared
from
the
interminable
plain
.
 
<EOS>
Far
away
the
dusty
vines
overhanging
wayside
cottages
,
and
the
monotonous
wayside
avenues
of
parched
trees
without
shade
,
drooped
beneath
the
stare
of
earth
and
sky
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
the
horses
with
drowsy
bells
,
in
long
files
of
carts
,
creeping
slowly
towards
the
interior
;
so
did
their
recumbent
drivers
,
when
they
were
awake
,
which
rarely
happened
;
so
did
the
exhausted
labourers
in
the
fields
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
that
lived
or
grew
,
was
oppressed
by
the
glare
;
except
the
lizard
,
passing
swiftly
over
rough
stone
walls
,
and
the
cicala
,
chirping
his
dry
hot
chirp
,
like
a
rattle
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
dust
was
scorched
brown
,
and
something
quivered
in
the
atmosphere
as
if
the
air
itself
were
panting
.
   
<EOS>
Blinds
,
shutters
,
curtains
,
awnings
,
were
all
closed
and
drawn
to
keep
out
the
stare
.
 
<EOS>
Grant
it
but
a
chink
or
keyhole
,
and
<EOS>
it
shot
in
like
a
white
-
hot
arrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
churches
were
the
freest
from
it
.
<EOS>
To
come
out
of
the
twilight
of
pillars
and
arches
---
dreamily
dotted
with
winking
lamps
,
dreamily
peopled
with
ugly
old
shadows
piously
dozing
,
spitting
,
and
begging
---
was
to
plunge
into
a
fiery
river
,
and
swim
for
life
to
the
nearest
strip
of
shade
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
with
people
lounging
and
lying
wherever
shade
was
,
with
but
little
hum
of
tongues
or
barking
of
dogs
,
with
occasional
jangling
of
discordant
church
bells
and
rattling
of
vicious
drums
,
Marseilles
,
a
fact
to
be
strongly
smelt
and
tasted
,
lay
broiling
in
the
sun
one
day
.
<EOS>
In
Marseilles
that
day
there
was
a
villainous
prison
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
of
its
chambers
,
so
repulsive
a
place
that
even
the
obtrusive
stare
blinked
at
it
,
and
left
it
to
such
refuse
of
reflected
light
as
it
could
find
for
itself
,
were
two
men
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
the
two
men
,
a
notched
and
disfigured
bench
,
immovable
from
the
wall
,
with
a
draught
-
board
rudely
hacked
upon
it
with
a
knife
,
a
set
of
draughts
,
made
of
old
buttons
and
soup
bones
,
a
set
of
dominoes
,
two
mats
,
and
two
or
three
wine
bottles
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
all
the
chamber
held
,
exclusive
of
rats
and
other
unseen
vermin
,
in
addition
to
the
seen
vermin
,
the
two
men
.
   
<EOS>
It
received
such
light
as
it
got
through
a
grating
of
iron
bars
fashioned
like
a
pretty
large
window
,
by
means
of
which
it
could
be
always
inspected
from
the
gloomy
staircase
on
which
the
grating
gave
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
broad
strong
ledge
of
stone
to
this
grating
where
the
bottom
of
it
was
let
into
the
masonry
,
three
or
four
feet
above
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
it
,
one
of
the
two
men
lolled
,
half
sitting
and
half
lying
,
with
his
knees
drawn
up
,
and
his
feet
and
shoulders
planted
against
the
opposite
sides
of
the
aperture
.
 
<EOS>
The
bars
were
wide
enough
apart
to
admit
of
his
thrusting
his
arm
through
to
the
elbow
;
and
so
he
held
on
negligently
,
for
his
greater
ease
.
   
<EOS>
A
prison
taint
was
on
everything
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
imprisoned
air
,
the
imprisoned
light
,
the
imprisoned
damps
,
the
imprisoned
men
,
were
all
deteriorated
by
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
captive
men
were
faded
and
haggard
,
so
the
iron
was
rusty
,
the
stone
was
slimy
,
the
wood
was
rotten
,
the
air
was
faint
,
the
light
was
dim
.
 
<EOS>
Like
a
well
,
like
a
vault
,
like
a
tomb
,
the
prison
had
no
knowledge
of
the
brightness
outside
,
and
would
have
kept
its
polluted
atmosphere
intact
in
one
of
the
spice
islands
of
the
Indian
ocean
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
who
lay
on
the
ledge
of
the
grating
was
even
chilled
.
 
<EOS>
He
jerked
his
great
cloak
more
heavily
upon
him
by
an
impatient
movement
of
one
shoulder
,
and
growled
,
"
To
the
devil
with
this
Brigand
of
a
Sun
that
never
shines
in
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
waiting
to
be
fed
,
looking
sideways
through
the
bars
that
he
might
see
the
further
down
the
stairs
,
with
much
of
the
expression
of
a
wild
beast
in
similar
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
eyes
,
too
close
together
,
were
not
so
nobly
set
in
his
head
as
those
of
the
king
of
beasts
are
in
his
,
and
they
were
sharp
rather
than
bright
---
pointed
weapons
with
little
surface
to
betray
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
no
depth
or
change
;
they
glittered
,
and
they
opened
and
shut
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
,
and
waiving
their
use
to
himself
,
a
clockmaker
could
have
made
a
better
pair
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
hook
nose
,
<EOS>
handsome
after
its
kind
,
but
too
high
between
the
eyes
by
probably
just
as
much
as
his
eyes
were
too
near
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
he
was
large
and
tall
in
frame
,
had
thin
lips
,
where
his
thick
moustache
showed
them
at
all
,
and
a
quantity
of
dry
hair
,
of
no
definable
colour
,
in
its
shaggy
state
,
but
shot
with
red
.
 
<EOS>
The
hand
with
which
he
held
the
grating
(
seamed
all
over
the
back
with
ugly
scratches
newly
healed
)
,
was
unusually
small
and
plump
;
would
have
been
unusually
white
but
for
the
prison
grime
.
<EOS>
The
other
man
was
lying
on
the
stone
floor
,
covered
with
a
coarse
brown
coat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
up
,
pig
!
<EOS>
"
growled
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
sleep
when
I
am
hungry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
one
,
master
,
"
said
the
pig
,
in
a
submissive
manner
,
and
not
without
cheerfulness
;
"
I
can
wake
when
I
will
,
I
can
sleep
when
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
said
it
,
he
rose
,
shook
himself
,
scratched
himself
,
tied
his
brown
coat
loosely
round
his
neck
by
the
sleeves
<EOS>
(
he
had
previously
used
it
as
a
coverlet
)
,
and
sat
down
upon
the
pavement
yawning
,
with
his
back
against
the
wall
opposite
to
the
grating
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
what
the
hour
is
,
"
grumbled
the
first
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
mid
-
day
bells
will
ring
---
in
forty
minutes
.
"
 
<EOS>
When
he
made
the
little
pause
,
he
had
looked
round
the
prison
-
room
,
as
if
for
certain
information
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
clock
.
 
<EOS>
How
is
it
that
you
always
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
always
know
what
the
hour
is
,
and
where
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
was
brought
in
here
at
night
,
and
out
of
a
boat
,
but
I
know
where
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
See
here
!
 
<EOS>
Marseilles
harbour
;
"
on
his
knees
on
the
pavement
,
mapping
it
all
out
with
a
swarthy
forefinger
;
"
Toulon
(
where
the
galleys
are
)
,
Spain
over
there
,
Algiers
over
there

<EOS>
Creeping

Round
by

Stand

<EOS>
Out
again
for
Civita

<EOS>
so
away
to
---
hey
!
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
room
for
Naples
;
"
he
had
got
to
the
wall
by
this
time
;
"
but
it
's
all
one
;
it
's
in
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
remained
on
his
knees
,
looking
up
at
his
fellow
-
prisoner
with
a
lively
look
for
a
prison
.
 
<EOS>
A
sunburnt
,
quick
,
lithe
,
<EOS>
little
man
,
though
rather
thickset
.
 
<EOS>
Earrings
in
his
brown
ears
,
white
teeth
lighting
up
his
grotesque
brown
face
,
intensely
black
hair
clustering
about
his
brown
throat
,
a
ragged
red
shirt
open
at
his
brown
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Loose
,
seaman
-
like
trousers
,
decent
shoes
,
a
long
red
cap
,
a
red
sash
round
his
waist
,
and
a
knife
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Judge
if
I
come
back
from
Naples
as
I
went
!
 
<EOS>
See

my

Off

Marseilles

you

<EOS>
The
apartment
of
the
jailer
and
his
keys
is
where
I
put
this
thumb
;
and
here
at
my
wrist
they
keep
the
national
razor
in
its
case
---
the
guillotine
locked
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
other
man
spat
suddenly
on
the
pavement
,
and
gurgled
in
his
throat
.
   
<EOS>
Some
lock
below
gurgled
in
its
throat
immediately
afterwards
,
and
then
a
door
crashed
.
 
<EOS>
Slow
steps
began
ascending
the
stairs
;
the
prattle
of
a
sweet
little
voice
mingled
with
the
noise
they
made
;
and
the
prison
-
keeper
appeared
carrying
his
daughter
,
three
or
four
years
old
,
and
a
basket
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
goes
the
world
this
forenoon
,
gentlemen
?
 
<EOS>
My
little
one
,
you
see
,
going
round
with
me
to
have
a
peep
at
her
father
's
birds
.
<EOS>
Fie
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
Look
at
the
birds
,
my
pretty
,
look
at
the
birds
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
sharply
at
the
birds
himself
,
as
he
held
the
child
up
at
the
grate
,
especially
at
the
little
bird
,
whose
activity
he
seemed
to
mistrust
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
your
bread
,
Signor
John
Baptist
,
"
said
he
(
they
all
spoke
in
French
,
but
<EOS>
the
little
man
was
an
Italian
)
;
"
and
if
I
might
recommend
you
not
to
game
---
"
   
"
You
do
n't
recommend
the
master
!
"
said
John
Baptist
,
showing
his
teeth
as
he
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
but
the
master
wins
,
"
returned
the
jailer
,
with
a
passing
look
of
no
particular
liking
at
the
other
man
,
"
and
you
lose
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
quite
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
You
get
husky
bread
and
sour
drink
by
it
;
and
he
gets
sausage
of
Lyons
,
veal
in
savoury
jelly
,
white
bread
,
strachino
cheese
,
and
good
wine
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
the
birds
,
my
pretty
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
birds
!
"
said
the
child
.
   
<EOS>
The
fair
little
face
,
touched
with
divine
compassion
,
as
it
peeped
shrinkingly
through
the
grate
,
was
like
an
angel
's
in
the
prison
.
<EOS>
John
Baptist
rose
and
moved
towards
it
,
as
if
it
had
a
good
attraction
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
bird
remained
as
before
,
except
for
an
impatient
glance
at
the
basket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
said
the
jailer
,
putting
his
little
daughter
on
the
outer
ledge
of
the
grate
,
"
she
shall
feed
the
birds
.
 
<EOS>
This
big
loaf
is
for
Signor
John
Baptist
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
break
it
to
get
it
through
into
the
cage
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
there
's
a
tame
bird
to
kiss
the
little
hand
!
 
<EOS>
This
sausage
in
a
vine
leaf
is
for
Monsieur
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
Again
---
this
veal
in
savoury
jelly
is
for
Monsieur
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
Again
---
these
three
white
little
loaves
are
for
Monsieur
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
this
cheese
---
again
,
this
wine
---
again
,
this
tobacco
---
all
for
Monsieur
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
Lucky
bird
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
child
put
all
these
things
between
the
bars
into
the
soft
,
Smooth
,
well
-
shaped
hand
,
with
evident
dread
---
more
than
once
drawing
back
her
own
and
looking
at
the
man
with
her
fair
brow
roughened
into
an
expression
half
of
fright
and
half
of
anger
.
<EOS>
Whereas
she
had
put
the
lump
of
coarse
bread
into
the
swart
,
scaled
,
knotted
hands
of
John
Baptist
(
who
had
scarcely
as
much
nail
on
his
eight
fingers
and
two
thumbs
as
would
have
made
out
one
for
Monsieur
Rigaud
)
,
with
ready
confidence
;
and
,
when
he
kissed
her
hand
,
had
herself
passed
it
caressingly
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
Rigaud
,
indifferent
to
this
distinction
,
propitiated
the
father
by
laughing
and
nodding
at
the
daughter
as
often
as
she
gave
him
anything
;
and
,
so
soon
as
he
had
all
his
viands
about
him
in
convenient
nooks
of
the
ledge
on
which
he
rested
,
began
to
eat
with
an
appetite
.
   
<EOS>
When
Monsieur
Rigaud
laughed
,
a
change
took
place
in
his
face
,
that
was
more
remarkable
than
prepossessing
.
 
<EOS>
His
moustache
went
up
under
his
nose
,
and
his
nose
came
down
over
his
moustache
,
in
a
very
sinister
and
cruel
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
the
jailer
,
turning
his
basket
upside
down
to
beat
the
crumbs
out
,
"
I
have
expended
all
the
money
I
received
;
here
is
the
note
of
it
,
and
that
's
a
thing
accomplished
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Rigaud
,
as
I
expected
yesterday
,
the
President
will
look
for
the
pleasure
of
your
society
at
an
hour
after
mid
-
day
,
to
-
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
try
me
,
eh
?
"
said
Rigaud
,
pausing
,
knife
in
hand
and
morsel
in
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
try
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
news
for
me
?
"
asked
John
Baptist
,
who
had
begun
,
contentedly
,
to
munch
his
bread
.
   
<EOS>
The
jailer
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lady
of
mine
!
 
<EOS>
Am
I
to
lie
here
all
my
life
,
my
father
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
know
!
"
cried
the
jailer
,
turning
upon
him
with
southern
quickness
,
and
gesticulating
with
both
his
hands
and
all
his
fingers
,
as
if
he
were
threatening
to
tear
him
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
how
is
it
possible
for
me
to
tell
how
long
you
are
to
lie
here
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
know
,
John
Baptist
Cavalletto
?
 
<EOS>
Death
of
my
life
!
<EOS>
There
are
prisoners
here
sometimes
,
who
are
not
in
such
a
devil
of
a
hurry
to
be
tried
.
"
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
glance
obliquely
at
Monsieur
Rigaud
in
this
remark
;
but
Monsieur
Rigaud
had
already
resumed
his
meal
,
though
not
with
quite
so
quick
an
appetite
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Adieu
,
my
birds
!
"
said
the
keeper
of
the
prison
,
taking
his
pretty
child
in
his
arms
,
and
dictating
the
words
with
a
kiss
.
   
<EOS>
"
Adieu
,
my
birds
!
"
<EOS>
the
pretty
child
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
Her
innocent
face
looked
back
so
brightly
over
his
shoulder
,
as
he
walked
away
with
her
,
singing
her
the
song
of
the
child
's
game
:
        
<EOS>
"
Who
passes
by
this
road
so
late
?
          
Compagnon
de
la
Majolaine
!
     
<EOS>
Who
passes
by
this
road
so
late
?
          
<EOS>
Always
gay
!
"
   
<EOS>
that
John
Baptist
felt
it
a
point
of
honour
to
reply
at
the
grate
,
and
in
good
time
and
tune
,
though
a
little
hoarsely
:
        
<EOS>
"
Of
all
the
king
's
knights
"
tis
the
flower
,
          
Compagnon
de

Majolaine
!
     
<EOS>
Of
all
the
king
's
knights
"
tis
the
flower
,
          
<EOS>
Always
gay
!
"
   
<EOS>
which
accompanied
them
so
far
down
the
few
steep
stairs
,
that
the
prison
-
keeper
had
to
stop
at
last
for
his
little
daughter
to
hear
the
song
out
,
and
repeat
the
Refrain
while
they
were
yet
in
sight
.
<EOS>
Then
the
child
's
head
disappeared
,
and
the
prison
-
keeper
's
head
disappeared
,
but
the
little
voice
prolonged
the
strain
until
the
door
clashed
.
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
Rigaud
,
finding
the
listening
John
Baptist
in
his
way
before
the
echoes
had
ceased
<EOS>
(
even
the
echoes
were
the
weaker
for
imprisonment
,
and
seemed
to
lag
)
,
reminded
him
with
a
push
of
his
foot
that
he
had
better
resume
his
own
darker
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
man
sat
down
again
upon
the
pavement
with
the
negligent
ease
of
one
who
was
thoroughly
accustomed
to
pavements
;
and
placing
three
hunks
of
coarse
bread
before
himself
,
and
falling
to
upon
a
fourth
,
began
contentedly
to
work
his
way
through
them
as
if
to
clear
them
off
were
a
sort
of
game
.
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
glanced
at
the
Lyons
sausage
,
and
perhaps
he
glanced
at
the
veal
in
savoury
jelly
,
but
they
were
not
there
long
,
to
make
his
mouth
water
;
Monsieur
Rigaud
soon
dispatched
them
,
in
spite
of
the
president
and
tribunal
,
and
proceeded
to
suck
his
fingers
as
clean
as
he
could
,
and
to
wipe
them
on
his
vine
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
he
paused
in
his
drink
to
contemplate
his
fellow
-
prisoner
,
his
moustache
went
up
,
and
his
nose
came
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
find
the
bread
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
dry
,
<EOS>
but
I
have
my
old
sauce
here
,
"
returned
John
Baptist
,
holding
up
his
knife
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
sauce
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
cut
my
bread
<EOS>
so
---
like
a
melon
.
 
<EOS>
Or
so
---
like
an
omelette
.
 
<EOS>
Or
so
---
like
a
fried
fish
.
 
<EOS>
Or
so
---
like
Lyons
sausage
,
"
said
John
Baptist
,
demonstrating
the
various
cuts
on
the
bread
he
held
,
and
soberly
chewing
what
he
had
in
his
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
!
"
cried
Monsieur
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
drink
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
finish
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
no
great
gift
,
for
there
was
mighty
little
wine
left
;
but
Signor
Cavalletto
,
jumping
to
his
feet
,
received
the
bottle
gratefully
,
turned
it
upside
down
at
his
mouth
,
and
smacked
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Put
the
bottle
by
with
the
rest
,
"
said
Rigaud
.
   
<EOS>
The
little
man
obeyed
his
orders
,
and
stood
ready
to
give
him
a
lighted
match
;
for
he
was
now
rolling
his
tobacco
into
cigarettes
by
the
aid
of
little
squares
of
paper
which
had
been
brought
in
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
thanks
,
my
master
!
"
<EOS>
John
Baptist
said
in
his
own
language
,
and
with
the
quick
conciliatory
manner
of
his
own
countrymen
.
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
Rigaud
arose
,
lighted
a
cigarette
,
put
the
rest
of
his
stock
into
a
breast
-
pocket
,
and
stretched
himself
out
at
full
length
upon
the
bench
.
 
<EOS>
Cavalletto
sat
down
on
the
pavement
,
holding
one
of
his
ankles
in
each
hand
,
and
smoking
peacefully
.
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
some
uncomfortable
attraction
of
Monsieur
Rigaud
's
eyes
to
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
that
part
of
the
pavement
where
the
thumb
had
been
in
the
plan
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
so
drawn
in
that
direction
,
that
the
Italian
more
than
once
followed
them
to
and
back
from
the
pavement
in
some
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
infernal
hole
this
is
!
"
said
Monsieur
Rigaud
,
breaking
a
long
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
the
light
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
Day
?
 
<EOS>
the
light
of
yesterday
week
,
the
light
of
six
months
ago
,
the
light
of
six
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
So
slack
and
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
came
languishing
down
a
square
funnel
that
blinded
a
window
in
the
staircase
wall
,
through
which
the
sky
was
never
seen
---
nor
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cavalletto
,
"
said
Monsieur
Rigaud
,
suddenly
withdrawing
his
gaze
from
this
funnel
to
which
they
had
both
involuntarily
turned
their
eyes
,
"
you
know
me
for
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
surely
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
have
we
been
here
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
,
eleven
weeks
,
to

morrow
night
at
midnight

<EOS>
You

nine
weeks
and
three
days
,
at
five
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
ever
done
anything
here
?
 
<EOS>
Ever
touched
the
broom
,
or
spread
the
mats
,
or
rolled
them
up
,
or
found
the
draughts
,
or
collected
the
dominoes
,
or
put
my
hand
to
any
kind
of
work
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
ever
thought
of
looking
to
me
to
do
any
kind
of
work
?
"
   
<EOS>
John
Baptist
answered
with
that
peculiar
back
-
handed
shake
of
the
right
forefinger
which
is
the
most
expressive
negative
in
the
Italian
language
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
You
knew
from
the
first
moment
when
you
saw
me
here
,
that
I
was
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
ALTRO
!
<EOS>
"
returned
John
Baptist
,
closing
his
eyes
and
giving
his
head
a
most
vehement
toss
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
being
,
according
to
its
Genoese
emphasis
,
a
confirmation
,
a
contradiction
,
an
assertion
,
a
denial
,
a
taunt
,
a
compliment
,
a
joke
,
and
fifty
other
things
,
became
in
the
present
instance
,
with
a
significance
beyond
all
power
of
written
expression
,
our
familiar
English
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
Haha

<EOS>
You
are
right

A
gentleman
I
am

<EOS>
And
a
gentleman
I
'll
live

and
a

I
'll
die

It

my
intent
to
be
a

It

my

<EOS>
Death
of
my
soul

I
play
it
out
wherever

"
   
<EOS>
He
changed
his
posture
to
a
sitting
one
,
crying
with
a
triumphant
air
:
   
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am

<EOS>
Shaken
out
of
destiny
's
dice

box
into
the
company
of
a
mere
smuggler
;
---
shut
up
with
a
poor
little
contraband
trader
,
whose
papers
are
wrong
,
and
whom
the
police
lay
hold
of
besides
,
for
placing
his
boat
(
as
a
means
of
getting
beyond
the
frontier

at
the
disposition
of
other
little
people
whose
papers

instinctively
recognises
my

even
by
this
light

in
this

It

By
Heaven

I

<EOS>
Again
his
moustache
went
up
,
and
his
nose
came
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
hour
now

<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
with
a
dry
hot
pallor
upon
him
,
rather
difficult
of
association
with
merriment
.

<EOS>
Signor
Cavalletto
took
his
cigarette
from
between
his
parted
lips
,
and
showed
more
momentary
discomfiture
than
might
have
been
expected

Monsieur

His
theatrical
air
,
as
he
stood
with
one
arm
on
his
hip
within
the
folds
of
his
cloak
,
together
with
his
manner
of
disregarding
his
companion
and
addressing
the
opposite
wall
instead
,
seemed
to
intimate
that
he
was
rehearsing
for
the
President
,
whose
examination
he
was
shortly
to
undergo
,
rather
than
troubling
himself
merely
to
enlighten
so
small
a
person
as
John
Baptist
Cavalletto
.

He
kept
his
small
smooth
hand
in
constant
requisition
,
as
if
it
were
a
witness
to
his
gentility

had
often
done

good

John

having
smoked
his
cigarette
down
to
his
fingers
'
ends
,
Monsieur
Rigaud
had
the
magnanimity
to
throw
him
another

He
lighted
the
second
at
the
ashes
of
the
first

and
smoked
on
,
looking
sideways
at
his
companion

who
,
preoccupied
with
his
own
case

Monsieur
Barronneau
left
a
widow
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
two
-
and
-
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
gained
a
reputation
for
beauty
,
and
(
which
is
often
another
thing
)
was
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
I
continued
to
live
at
the
Cross
of
Gold
.
<EOS>
I
married
Madame
Barronneau
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
me
to
say
whether
there
was
any
great
disparity
in
such
a
match
.
 
<EOS>
Here
I
stand
,
with
the
contamination
of
a
jail
upon
me
;
but
it
is
possible
that
you
may
think
me
better
suited
to
her
than
her
former
husband
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
a
certain
air
of
being
a
handsome
man
---
which
he
was
not
;
and
a
certain
air
of
being
a
well
-
bred
man
---
which
he
was
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
mere
swagger
and
challenge
;
but
in
this
particular
,
as
in
many
others
,
blustering
assertion
goes
for
proof
,
half
over
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
it
as
it
may
,
Madame
Barronneau
approved
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
not
to
prejudice
me
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
eye
happening
to
light
upon
John
Baptist
with
this
inquiry
,
that
little
man
briskly
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
,
and
repeated
in
an
argumentative
tone
under
his
breath
,
altro
,
altro
,
altro
,
altro
---
an
infinite
number
of
times
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
came
the
difficulties
of
our
position
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
proud
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
in
defence
of
pride
,
but
I
am
proud
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
also
my
character
to
govern
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
submit
;
I
must
govern
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
the
property
of
Madame
Rigaud
was
settled
upon
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
insane
act
of
her
late
husband
.
 
<EOS>
More
unfortunately
still
,
she
had
relations
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
wife
's
relations
interpose
against
a
husband
who
is
a
gentleman
,
who
is
proud
,
and
who
must
govern
,
the
consequences
are
inimical
to
peace
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
yet
another
source
of
difference
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
Rigaud
was
unfortunately
a
little
vulgar
.
 
<EOS>
I
sought
to
improve
her
manners
and
ameliorate
her
general
tone
;
she
(
supported
in
this
likewise
by
her
relations
)
resented
my
endeavours
.
 
<EOS>
Quarrels
began
to
arise
between
us
;
and
,
propagated
and
exaggerated
by
the
slanders
of
the
relations
of
Madame
Rigaud
,
to
become
notorious
to
the
neighbours
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
that
I
treated
Madame
Rigaud
with
cruelty
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
been
seen
to
slap
her
face
---
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
light
hand
;
and
if
I
have
been
seen
apparently
to
correct
Madame
Rigaud
in
that
manner
,
I
have
done
it
almost
playfully
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
If
the
playfulness
of
Monsieur
Rigaud
were
at
all
expressed
by
his
smile
at
this
point
,
the
relations
of
Madame
Rigaud
might
have
said
that
they
would
have
much
preferred
his
correcting
that
unfortunate
woman
seriously
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sensitive
and
brave
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
advance
it
as
a
merit
to
be
sensitive
and
brave
,
but
it
is
my
character
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
male
relations
of
Madame
Rigaud
had
put
themselves
forward
openly
,
I
should
have
known
how
to
deal
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
knew
that
,
and
their
machinations
were
conducted
in
secret
;
consequently
,
Madame
Rigaud
and
I
were
brought
into
frequent
and
unfortunate
collision
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
I
wanted
any
little
sum
of
money
for
my
personal
expenses
,
I
could
not
obtain
it
without
collision
---
and
I
,
too
,
a
man
whose
character
it
is
to
govern
!
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
Madame
Rigaud
and
myself
were
walking
amicably
---
I
may
say
like
lovers
---
on
a
height
overhanging
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
An
evil
star
occasioned
Madame
Rigaud
to
advert
to
her
relations
;
I
reasoned
with
her
on
that
subject
,
and
remonstrated
on
the
want
of
duty
and
devotion
manifested
in
her
allowing
herself
to
be
influenced
by
their
jealous
animosity
towards
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
Rigaud
retorted
;
I
retorted
;
Madame
Rigaud
grew
warm
;
I
grew
warm
,
and
provoked
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
admit
it
.
<EOS>
Frankness
is
a
part
of
my
character
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
Madame
Rigaud
,
in
an
access
of
fury
that
I
must
ever
deplore
,
threw
herself
upon
me
with
screams
of
passion
(
no
doubt
those
that
were
overheard
at
some
distance
)
,
tore
my
clothes
,
tore
my
hair
,
lacerated
my
hands
,
trampled
and
trod
the
dust
,
and
finally
leaped
over
,
dashing
herself
to
death
upon
the
rocks
below
.
 
<EOS>
Such
is
the
train
of
incidents
which
malice
has
perverted
into
my
endeavouring
to
force
from
Madame
Rigaud
a
relinquishment
of
her
rights
;
and
,
on
her
persistence
in
a
refusal
to
make
the
concession
I
required
,
struggling
with
her
---
assassinating
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stepped
aside
to
the
ledge
where
the
vine
leaves
yet
lay
strewn
about
,
collected
two
or
three
,
and
stood
wiping
his
hands
upon
them
,
with
his
back
to
the
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
he
demanded
after
a
silence
,
"
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
all
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
ugly
,
"
returned
the
little
man
,
who
had
risen
,
and
was
brightening
his
knife
upon
his
shoe
,
as
he
leaned
an
arm
against
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
<EOS>
John
Baptist
polished
his
knife
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
I
have
not
represented
the
case
correctly
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Al
-
tro
!
"
returned
John
Baptist
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
was
an
apology
now
,
and
stood
for
"
Oh
,
by
no
means
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
then
?
"
   
"
Presidents
and
tribunals
are
so
prejudiced
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
cried
the
other
,
uneasily
flinging
the
end
of
his
cloak
over
his
shoulder
with
an
oath
,
"
let
them
do
their
worst
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Truly
I
think
they
will
,
"
murmured
John
Baptist
to
himself
,
as
he
bent
his
head
to
put
his
knife
in
his
sash
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
on
either
side
,
though
they
both
began
walking
to
and
fro
,
and
necessarily
crossed
at
every
turn
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
Rigaud
sometimes
stopped
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
put
his
case
in
a
new
light
,
or
make
some
irate
remonstrance
;
but
Signor
Cavalletto
continuing
to
go
slowly
to
and
fro
at
a
grotesque
kind
of
jog
-
trot
pace
with
his
eyes
turned
downward
,
nothing
came
of
these
inclinings
.
   
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
the
noise
of
the
key
in
the
lock
arrested
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
The
sound
of
voices
succeeded
,
and
the
tread
of
feet
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
clashed
,
the
voices
and
the
feet
came
on
,
and
the
prison
-
keeper
slowly
ascended
the
stairs
,
followed
by
a
guard
of
soldiers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Monsieur
Rigaud
,
"
said
he
,
pausing
for
a
moment
at
the
grate
,
with
his
keys
in
his
hands
,
"
have
the
goodness
to
come
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
depart
in
state
,
I
see
?
"
<EOS>
"
Why
,
unless
you
did
,
"
returned
the
jailer
,
"
you
might
depart
in
so
many
pieces
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
you
together
again
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
crowd
,
Monsieur
Rigaud
,
and
it
does
n't
love
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
passed
on
out
of
sight
,
and
unlocked
and
unbarred
a
low
door
in
the
corner
of
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
opened
it
and
appeared
within
,
"
come
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
sort
of
whiteness
in
all
the
hues
under
the
sun
at
all
like
the
whiteness
of
Monsieur
Rigaud
's
face
as
it
was
then
.
<EOS>
Neither
is
there
any
expression
of
the
human
countenance
at
all
like
that
expression
in
every
little
line
of
which
the
frightened
heart
is
seen
to
beat
.
 
<EOS>
Both
are
conventionally
compared
with
death
;
but
the
difference
is
the
whole
deep
gulf
between
the
struggle
done
,
and
the
fight
at
its
most
desperate
extremity
.
   
<EOS>
He
lighted
another
of
his
paper
cigars
at
his
companion
's
;
put
it
tightly
between
his
teeth
;
covered
his
head
with
a
soft
slouched
hat
;
threw
the
end
of
his
cloak
over
his
shoulder
again
;
and
walked
out
into
the
side
gallery
on
which
the
door
opened
,
without
taking
any
further
notice
of
Signor
Cavalletto
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
that
little
man
himself
,
his
whole
attention
had
become
absorbed
in
getting
near
the
door
and
looking
out
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Precisely
as
a
beast
might
approach
the
opened
gate
of
his
den
and
eye
the
freedom
beyond
,
he
passed
those
few
moments
in
watching
and
peering
,
until
the
door
was
closed
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
officer
in
command
of
the
soldiers
;
a
stout
,
serviceable
,
profoundly
calm
man
,
with
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
,
smoking
a
cigar
.
 
<EOS>
He
very
briefly
directed
the
placing
of
Monsieur
Rigaud
in
the
midst
of
the
party
,
put
himself
with
consummate
indifference
at
their
head
,
gave
the
word
"
march
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
they
all
went
jingling
down
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
clashed
---
the
key
turned
---
and
a
ray
of
unusual
light
,
and
a
breath
of
unusual
air
,
<EOS>
seemed
to
have
passed
through
the
jail
,
vanishing
in
a
tiny
wreath
of
smoke
from
the
cigar
.
   
<EOS>
Still
,
in
his
captivity
,
like
a
lower
animal
---
like
some
impatient
ape
,
or
roused
bear
of
the
smaller
species
---
the
prisoner
,
now
left
solitary
,
had
jumped
upon
the
ledge
,
to
lose
no
glimpse
of
this
departure
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
yet
stood
clasping
the
grate
with
both
hands
,
an
uproar
broke
upon
his
hearing
;
yells
,
shrieks
,
oaths
,
threats
,
execrations
,
all
comprehended
in
it
,
though
(
as
in
a
storm
)
<EOS>
nothing
but
a
raging
swell
of
sound
distinctly
heard
.
   
<EOS>
Excited
into
a
still
greater
resemblance
to
a
caged
wild
animal
by
his
anxiety
to
know
more
,
the
prisoner
leaped
nimbly
down
,
ran
round
the
chamber
,
leaped
nimbly
up
again
,
clasped
the
grate
and
tried
to
shake
it
,
leaped
down
and
ran
,
leaped
up
and
listened
,
and
never
rested
until
the
noise
,
becoming
more
and
more
distant
,
had
died
away
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
better
prisoners
have
worn
their
noble
hearts
out
so
;
no
man
thinking
of
it
;
not
even
the
beloved
of
their
souls
realising
it
;
great
kings
and
governors
,
who
had
made
them
captive
,
careering
in
the
sunlight
jauntily
,
and
men
cheering
them
on
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
said
great
personages
dying
in
bed
,
making
exemplary
ends
and
sounding
speeches
;
and
polite
history
,
more
servile
than
their
instruments
,
embalming
them
!
   
<EOS>
At
last
,
John
Baptist
,
now
able
to
choose
his
own
spot
within
the
compass
of
those
walls
for
the
exercise
of
his
faculty
of
going
to
sleep
when
he
would
,
lay
down
upon
the
bench
,
with
his
face
turned
over
on
his
crossed
arms
,
and
slumbered
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
submission
,
in
his
lightness
,
in
his
good
humour
,
in
his
short
-
lived
passion
,
in
his
easy
contentment
with
hard
bread
and
hard
stones
,
in
his
ready
sleep
,
in
his
fits
and
starts
,
altogether
a
true
son
of
the
land
that
gave
him
birth
.
   
<EOS>
The
wide
stare
stared
itself
out
for
one
while
;
the
Sun
went
down
in
a
red
,
green
,
golden
glory
;
the
stars
came
out
in
the
heavens
,
and
the
fire
-
flies
mimicked
them
in
the
lower
air
,
as
men
may
feebly
imitate
the
goodness
of
a
better
order
of
beings
;
the
long
dusty
roads
and
the
interminable
plains
were
in
repose
---
and
so
deep
a
hush
was
on
the
sea
,
that
it
scarcely
whispered
of
the
time
when
it
shall
give
up
its
dead
.

tune
into

It

without
allonging

marshonging

<EOS>
The
speaker
,
with
a
whimsical
good
humour
upon
him
all
the
time
,
looked
over
the
parapet
-
wall
with
the
greatest
disparagement
of
Marseilles
;
and
taking
up
a
determined
position
by
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
rattling
his
money
at
it
,
apostrophised
it
with
a
short
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Allong
and
marshong

indeed

<EOS>
It
would
be
more
creditable
to

I
think
,
to
let
other
people
allong
and
marshong
about

lawful

shutting

repeated
the
first

<EOS>
"
It
's
almost
an
aggravation

the
enormity

Out

For

I
must

But

we
come
from

East
,
and
as
the
East
is
the
country
of
the
plague
---
"
   
"
The
plague
!
"
repeated
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
grievance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
the
plague
continually
,
ever
since
I
have
been
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
like
a
sane
man
shut
up
in
a
madhouse
;
I
ca
n't
stand
the
suspicion
of
the
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
here
as
well
as
ever
I
was
in
my
life
;
but
to
suspect
me
of
the
plague
is
to
give
me
the
plague
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
had
it
---
and
<EOS>
I
have
got
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
bear
it
very
well
,
Mr
Meagles
,
"
said
the
second
speaker
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
knew
the
real
state
of
the
case
,
that
's
the
last
observation
you
would
think
of
making
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
waking
up
night
after
night
,
and
saying
,
NOW
I
have
got
it
,
NOW
it
has
developed
itself
,
<EOS>
NOW
I
am
in
for
it
,
NOW
these
fellows
are
making
out
their
case
for
their
precautions
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'd
as
soon
have
a
spit
put
through
me
,
and
be
stuck
upon
a
card
in
a
collection
of
beetles
,
as
lead
the
life
I
have
been
leading
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Meagles
,
say
no
more
about
it
now
<EOS>
it
's
over
,
"
urged
a
cheerful
feminine
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Over
!
"
repeated
Mr
Meagles
,
who
appeared
(
<EOS>
though
without
any
ill
-
nature
)
to
be
in
that
peculiar
state
of
mind
in
which
the
last
word
spoken
by
anybody
else
is
a
new
injury
.
 
<EOS>
"
Over
!
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
I
say
no
more
about
it
because
it
's
over
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
Mrs
Meagles
who
had
spoken
to
Mr
Meagles
;
and
Mrs
Meagles
was
,
like
Mr
Meagles
,
comely
and
healthy
,
with
a
pleasant
English
face
which
had
been
looking
at
homely
things
for
five
-
and
-
fifty
years
or
more
,
and
shone
with
a
bright
reflection
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
Father
,
never
mind
!
"
said
Mrs
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
goodness
sake
content
yourself
with
Pet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
Pet
?
"
repeated
Mr
Meagles
in
his
injured
vein
.
 
<EOS>
Pet
,
however
,
being
close
behind
him
,
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
Mr
Meagles
immediately
forgave
Marseilles
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
Pet
was
about
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
A
fair
girl
with
rich
brown
hair
hanging
free
in
natural
ringlets
.
 
<EOS>
A
lovely
girl
,
with
a
frank
face
,
and
wonderful
eyes
;
so
large
,
so
soft
,
so
bright
,
set
to
such
perfection
in
her
kind
good
head
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
round
and
fresh
and
dimpled
and
spoilt
,
and
there
was
in
Pet
an
air
of
timidity
and
dependence
which
was
the
best
weakness
in
the
world
,
and
gave
her
the
only
crowning
charm
a
girl
<EOS>
so
pretty
and
pleasant
could
have
been
without
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
ask
you
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
in
the
blandest
confidence
,
falling
back
a
step
himself
,
and
handing
his
daughter
a
step
forward
to
illustrate
his
question
:
"
I
ask
you
simply
,
as
between
man
and
man
,
you
know
,
DID
you
ever
hear
of
such
damned
nonsense
as
putting
Pet
in
quarantine
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
had
the
result
of
making
even
quarantine
enjoyable
.
"
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
that
's
something
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
you
for
that
remark
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Pet
,
my
darling
,
you
had
better
go
along
with
Mother
and
get
ready
for
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
The
officer
of
health
,
and
a
variety
of
humbugs
in
cocked
hats
,
are
coming
off
to
let
us
out
of
this
at
last
:
and
all
we
jail
-
birds
are
to
breakfast
together
in
something
approaching
to
a
Christian
style
again
,
before
we
take
wing
for
our
different
destinations
.
<EOS>
Tattycoram
,
stick
you
close
to
your
young
mistress
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
a
handsome
girl
with
lustrous
dark
hair
and
eyes
,
and
very
neatly
dressed
,
who
replied
with
a
half
curtsey
as
she
passed
off
in
the
train
of
Mrs
Meagles
and
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
They
crossed
the
bare
scorched
terrace
all
three
together
,
and
disappeared
through
a
staring
white
archway
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
's
companion
,
a
grave
dark
man
of
forty
,
still
stood
looking
towards
this
archway
after
they
were
gone
;
until
Mr
Meagles
tapped
him
on
the
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
he
,
starting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
They
took
one
silent
turn
backward
and
forward
in
the
shade
of
the
wall
,
getting
,
at
the
height
on
which
the
quarantine
barracks
are
placed
,
what
cool
refreshment
of
sea
breeze
<EOS>
there
was
at
seven
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
's
companion
resumed
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
what
is
the
name
of
---
"
   
"
Tattycoram
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
struck
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
idea
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
that
---
"
   
"
Tattycoram
?
"
suggested
Mr
Meagles
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
---
that
Tattycoram
was
a
name
;
and
I
have
several
times
wondered
at
the
oddity
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Meagles
and
myself
are
,
you
see
,
practical
people
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
you
have
frequently
mentioned
in
the
course
of
the
agreeable
and
interesting
conversations
we
have
had
together
,
walking
up
and
down
on
these
stones
,
"
said
the
other
,
with
a
half
smile
breaking
through
the
gravity
of
his
dark
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Practical
people
.
 
<EOS>
So
one
day
,
five
or
six
years
ago
now
,
when
we
took
Pet
to
church
at
the
Foundling
---
you
have
heard
of
the
Foundling
Hospital
in
London
?
 
<EOS>
Similar
to
the
Institution
for
the
Found
Children
in
Paris
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
One
day
when
we
took
Pet
to
church
there
to
hear
the
music
---
because
,
as
practical
people
,
it
is
the
business
of
our
lives
to
show
her
everything
that
we
think
can
please
her
---
<EOS>
Mother
(
my
usual
name
for
Mrs
Meagles
)
began
to
cry
so
,
that
it
was
necessary
to
take
her
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Mother
?
"
said
I
,
when
we
had
brought
her
a
little
round
:
<EOS>
"
you
are
frightening
Pet
,
my
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
that
,
Father
,
"
says
Mother
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
's
through
my
loving
her
so
much
,
that
it
ever
came
into
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
ever
what
came
into
your
head
,
Mother
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
O
dear
,
dear
!
"
cried
Mother
,
breaking
out
again
,
"
when
I
saw
all
those
children
ranged
tier
above
tier
,
and
appealing
from
the
father
none
of
them
has
ever
known
on
earth
,
to
the
great
Father
of
us
all
in
Heaven
,
I
thought
,
does
any
wretched
mother
ever
come
here
,
and
look
among
those
young
faces
,
wondering
which
is
the
poor
child
she
brought
into
this
forlorn
world
,
never
through
all
its
life
to
know
her
love
,
her
kiss
,
her
face
,
her
voice
,
even
her
name
!
"
 
<EOS>
Now
that
was
practical
in
Mother
,
and
I
told
her
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Mother
,
that
's
what
I
call
practical
in
you
,
my
dear
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
The
other
,
not
unmoved
,
assented
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
said
next
day
:
<EOS>
Now
,
Mother
,
I
have
a
proposition
to
make
that
I
think
you
'll
approve
of
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
take
one
of
those
same
little
children
to
be
a
little
maid
to
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
practical
people
.
 
<EOS>
So
if
we
should
find
her
temper
a
little
defective
,
or
any
of
her
ways
a
little
wide
of
ours
,
we
shall
know
what
we
have
to
take
into
account
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
know
what
an
immense
deduction
must
be
made
from
all
the
influences
and
experiences
that
have
formed
us
---
no
parents
,
no
child
-
brother
or
sister
,
no
individuality
of
home
,
no
Glass
Slipper
,
or
Fairy
Godmother
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
's
the
way
we
came
by
Tattycoram
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
name
itself
---
"
   
"
By
George
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
I
was
forgetting
the
name
itself
.
<EOS>
Why
,
she
was
called
in
the
Institution
,
Harriet
Beadle
---
an
arbitrary
name
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Harriet
we
changed
into
Hattey
,
and
then
into
Tatty
,
because
,
as
practical
people
,
we
thought
even
a
playful
name
might
be
a
new
thing
to
her
,
and
might
have
a
softening
and
affectionate
kind
of
effect
,
do
n't
you
see
?
 
<EOS>
As
to
Beadle
,
that
I
need
n't
say
was
wholly
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
is
anything
that
is
not
to
be
tolerated
on
any
terms
,
anything
that
is
a
type
of
Jack
-
in
-
office
insolence
and
absurdity
,
anything
that
represents
in
coats
,
waistcoats
,
and
big
sticks
<EOS>
our
English
holding
on
by
nonsense
after
every
one
has
found
it
out
,
it
is
a
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
n't
seen
a
beadle
lately
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
an
Englishman
who
has
been
more
than
twenty
years
in
China
,
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
laying
his
forefinger
on
his
companion
's
breast
with
great
animation
,
"
do
n't
you
see
a
beadle
,
now
,
if
you
can
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
I
see
a
beadle
in
full
fig
,
coming
down
a
street
on
a
Sunday
at
the
head
of
a
charity
school
,
I
am
obliged
to
turn
and
run
away
,
or
I
should
hit
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
Beadle
being
out
of
the
question
,
and
the
originator
of
the
Institution
for
these
poor
foundlings
having
been
a
blessed
creature
of
the
name
of
Coram
,
we
gave
that
name
to
Pet
's
little
maid
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
she
was
Tatty
,
and
at
one
time
she
was
Coram
,
until
we
got
into
a
way
of
mixing
the
two
names
together
,
and
now
she
is
always
Tattycoram
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
daughter
,
"
said
the
other
,
when
they
had
taken
another
silent
turn
to
and
fro
,
and
,
after
standing
for
a
moment
at
the
wall
glancing
down
at
the
sea
,
had
resumed
their
walk
,
"
is
your
only
child
,
I
know
,
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
ask
you
---
in
no
impertinent
curiosity
,
but
because
I
have
had
so
much
pleasure
in
your
society
,
<EOS>
may
never
in
this
labyrinth
of
a
world
exchange
a
quiet
word
with
you
again
,
and
wish
to
preserve
an
accurate
remembrance
of
you
and
yours
---
may
I
ask
you
,
if
I
have
not
gathered
from
your
good
wife
that
you
have
had
other
children
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
other
children
.
 
<EOS>
One
other
child
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
have
inadvertently
touched
upon
a
tender
theme
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
grave
about
it
,
I
am
not
at
all
sorrowful
.
 
<EOS>
It
quiets
me
for
a
moment
,
but
does
not
make
me
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
Pet
had
a
twin
sister
who
died
when
we
could
just
see
her
eyes
---
exactly
like
Pet
's
---
above
the
table
,
as
she
stood
on
tiptoe
holding
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
being
practical
people
,
a
result
has
gradually
sprung
up
in
the
minds
of
Mrs
Meagles
and
myself
which
perhaps
you
may
---
or
perhaps
you
may
not
---
understand
.
 
<EOS>
Pet
and
her
baby
sister
were
so
exactly
alike
,
and
so
completely
one
,
that
in
our
thoughts
we
have
never
been
able
to
separate
them
since
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
of
no
use
to
tell
us
that
our
dead
child
was
a
mere
infant
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
changed
that
child
according
to
the
changes
in
the
child
spared
to
us
and
always
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
As
Pet
has
grown
,
that
child
has
grown
;
as
Pet
has
become
more
sensible
and
womanly
,
her
sister
has
become
more
sensible
and
womanly
by
just
the
same
degrees
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
as
hard
to
convince
me
that
if
I
was
to
pass
into
the
other
world
to
-
morrow
,
I
should
not
,
through
the
mercy
of
God
,
be
received
there
by
a
daughter
,
just
like
Pet
,
as
to
persuade
me
that
Pet
herself
is
not
a
reality
at
my
side
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
"
said
the
other
,
gently
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
her
,
"
pursued
her
father
,
"
the
sudden
loss
of
her
little
picture
and
playfellow
,
and
her
early
association
with
that
mystery
in
which
we
all
have
our
equal
share
,
but
which
is
not
often
so
forcibly
presented
to
a
child
,
has
necessarily
had
some
influence
on
her
character
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
her
mother
and
I
were
not
young
when
we
married
,
and
Pet
has
always
had
a
sort
of
grown
-
up
life
with
us
,
though
we
have
tried
to
adapt
ourselves
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
advised
more
than
once
when
she
has
been
a
little
ailing
,
to
change
climate
and
air
for
her
as
often
as
we
could
---
especially
at
about
this
time
of
her
life
---
and
to
keep
her
amused
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
as
I
have
no
need
to
stick
at
a
bank
-
desk
now
(
though
I
have
been
poor
enough
in
my
time
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
or
I
should
have
married
Mrs
Meagles
long
before
)
,
we
go
trotting
about
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
how
you
found
us
staring
at
the
Nile
,
and
the
Pyramids
,
and
the
Sphinxes
,
and
the
Desert
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
;
and
this
is
how
Tattycoram
will
be
a
greater
traveller
in
course
of
time
than
Captain
Cook
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
very
heartily
for
your
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
mention
it
,
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
,
"
I
am
sure
you
are
quite
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mr
Clennam
,
perhaps
I
may
ask
you
whether
you
have
yet
come
to
a
decision
where
to
go
next
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
such
a
waif
and
stray
everywhere
,
that
I
am
liable
to
be
drifted
where
any
current
may
set
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
extraordinary
to
me
---
if
you
'll
excuse
my
freedom
in
saying
so
---
that
you
do
n't
go
straight
to
London
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
in
the
tone
of
a
confidential
adviser
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
shall
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
mean
with
a
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
will
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
"
---
he
coloured
a
little
,
---
"
next
to
none
that
I
can
put
in
action
now
.
 
<EOS>
Trained
by
main
force
;
broken
,
not
bent
;
heavily
ironed
with
an
object
on
which
I
was
never
consulted
and
which
was
never
mine
;
shipped
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
before
I
was
of
age
,
and
exiled
there
until
my
father
's
death
there
,
a
year
ago
;
always
grinding
in
a
mill
I
always
hated
;
what
is
to
be
expected
from
me
in
middle
life
?
 
<EOS>
Will
,
purpose
,
hope
?
 
<EOS>
All
those
lights
were
extinguished
before
I
could
sound
the
words
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Light
'em
up
again
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Easily
said
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
son
,
Mr
Meagles
,
of
a
hard
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
only
child
of
parents
who
weighed
,
measured
,
and
priced
everything
;
for
whom
what
could
not
be
weighed
,
measured
,
and
priced
,
had
no
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Strict
people
as
the
phrase
is
,
professors
of
a
stern
religion
,
their
very
religion
was
a
gloomy
sacrifice
of
tastes
and
sympathies
that
were
never
their
own
,
offered
up
as
a
part
of
a
bargain
for
the
security
of
their
possessions
.
 
<EOS>
Austere
faces
,
inexorable
discipline
,
penance
in
this
world
and
terror
in
the
next
---
<EOS>
nothing
graceful
or
gentle
anywhere
,
and
the
void
in
my
cowed
heart
everywhere
<EOS>
---
this
was
my
childhood
,
if
I
may
so
misuse
the
word
as
to
apply
it
to
such
a
beginning
of
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
though
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
made
very
uncomfortable
by
the
picture
offered
to
his
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
tough
commencement
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
now
study
,
and
profit
by
,
all
that
lies
beyond
it
,
like
a
practical
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
the
people
who
are
usually
called
practical
,
were
practical
in
your
direction
---
"
   
"
Why
,
so
they
are
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
indeed
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
suppose
so
,
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
,
thinking
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
One
can
but
be
practical
,
and
Mrs
Meagles
and
myself
are
nothing
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
unknown
course
is
easier
and
more
helpful
than
I
had
expected
to
find
it
,
then
,
"
said
Clennam
,
shaking
his
head
with
his
grave
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
the
boat
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
boat
was
filled
with
the
cocked
hats
to
which
Mr
Meagles
entertained
a
national
objection
;
and
the
wearers
of
those
cocked
hats
landed
and
came
up
the
steps
,
and
all
the
impounded
travellers
congregated
together
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
then
a
mighty
production
of
papers
on
the
part
of
the
cocked
hats
,
and
a
calling
over
of
names
,
and
great
work
of
signing
,
sealing
,
stamping
,
inking
,
and
sanding
,
with
exceedingly
blurred
,
gritty
,
and
undecipherable
results
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
everything
was
done
according
to
rule
,
and
the
travellers
were
at
liberty
to
depart
whithersoever
they
would
.
   
<EOS>
They
made
little
account
of
stare
and
glare
,
in
the
new
pleasure
of
recovering
their
freedom
,
but
flitted
across
the
harbour
in
gay
boats
,
and
reassembled
at
a
great
hotel
,
whence
the
sun
was
excluded
by
closed
lattices
,
and
where
bare
paved
floors
,
lofty
ceilings
,
and
resounding
corridors
tempered
the
intense
heat
.
<EOS>
There
,
a
great
table
in
a
great
room
was
soon
profusely
covered
with
a
superb
repast
;
and
the
quarantine
quarters
became
bare
indeed
,
remembered
among
dainty
dishes
,
southern
fruits
,
cooled
wines
,
flowers
from
Genoa
,
snow
from
the
mountain
tops
,
and
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
flashing
in
the
mirrors
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
bear
those
monotonous
walls
no
ill
-
will
now
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
always
begins
to
forgive
a
place
as
soon
as
it
's
left
behind
;
I
dare
say
a
prisoner
begins
to
relent
towards
his
prison
,
after
he
is
let
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
about
thirty
in
company
,
and
all
talking
;
but
necessarily
in
groups
.
 
<EOS>
Father
and
Mother
Meagles
sat
with
their
daughter
between
them
,
the
last
three
on
one
side
of
the
table
:
on
the
opposite
side
sat
Mr
Clennam
;
a
tall
French
gentleman
with
raven
hair
and
beard
,
of
a
swart
and
terrible
,
not
to
say
genteelly
diabolical
aspect
,
but
who
had
shown
himself
the
mildest
of
men
;
and
a
handsome
young
Englishwoman
,
travelling
quite
alone
,
who
had
a
proud
observant
face
,
and
had
either
withdrawn
herself
from
the
rest
or
been
avoided
by
the
rest
---
nobody
,
herself
excepted
perhaps
,
could
have
quite
decided
which
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
party
were
of
the
usual
materials
:
travellers
on
business
,
and
travellers
for
pleasure
;
officers
from
India
on
leave
;
merchants
in
the
Greek
and
Turkey
trades
;
a
clerical
English
husband
in
a
meek
strait
-
waistcoat
,
on
a
wedding
trip
with
his
young
wife
;
a
majestic
English
mama
and
papa
,
of
the
patrician
order
,
with
a
family
of
three
growing
-
up
daughters
,
who
were
keeping
a
journal
for
the
confusion
of
their
fellow
-
creatures
;
and
a
deaf
old
English
mother
,
tough
in
travel
,
with
a
very
decidedly
grown
-
up
daughter
indeed
,
which
daughter
went
sketching
about
the
universe
in
the
expectation
of
ultimately
toning
herself
off
into
the
married
state
.
   
<EOS>
The
reserved
Englishwoman
took
up
Mr
Meagles
in
his
last
remark
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
that
a
prisoner
forgives
his
prison
?
"
said
she
,
slowly
and
with
emphasis
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
my
speculation
,
Miss
Wade
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
positively
how
a
prisoner
might
feel
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
one
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
doubts
,
"
said
the
French
gentleman
in
his
own
language
,
"
it
's
being
so
easy
to
forgive
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
Pet
had
to
translate
this
passage
to
Mr
Meagles
,
who
never
by
any
accident
acquired
any
knowledge
whatever
of
the
language
of
any
country
into
which
he
travelled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
that
's
a
pity
,
is
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
not
credulous
?
"
said
Miss
Wade
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
that
.
 
<EOS>
Put
it
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
ca
n't
believe
it
easy
to
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
experience
,
"
she
quietly
returned
,
"
has
been
correcting
my
belief
in
many
respects
,
for
some
years
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
our
natural
progress
,
I
have
heard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
not
natural
to
bear
malice
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
cheerily
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
been
shut
up
in
any
place
to
pine
and
suffer
,
I
should
always
hate
that
place
and
wish
to
burn
it
down
,
or
raze
it
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
.
"
<EOS>
"
Strong
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
to
the
Frenchman
;
it
being
another
of
his
habits
to
address
individuals
of
all
nations
in
idiomatic
English
,
with
a
perfect
conviction
that
they
were
bound
to
understand
it
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rather
forcible
in
our
fair
friend
,
you
'll
agree
with
me
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
French
gentleman
courteously
replied
,
"
Plait
-
il
?
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
Mr
Meagles
returned
with
much
satisfaction
,
"
You
are
right
.
 
<EOS>
My
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
breakfast
beginning
by
-
and
-
by
to
languish
,
Mr
Meagles
made
the
company
a
speech
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
short
enough
and
sensible
enough
,
considering
that
it
was
a
speech
at
all
,
and
hearty
.
 
<EOS>
It
merely
went
to
the
effect
that
as
they
had
all
been
thrown
together
by
chance
,
and
had
all
preserved
a
good
understanding
together
,
and
were
now
about
to
disperse
,
and
were
not
likely
ever
to
find
themselves
all
together
again
,
what
could
they
do
better
than
bid
farewell
to
one
another
,
and
give
one
another
good
-
speed
in
a
simultaneous
glass
of
cool
champagne
all
round
the
table
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
done
,
and
with
a
general
shaking
of
hands
the
assembly
broke
up
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
The
solitary
young
lady
all
this
time
had
said
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
She
rose
with
the
rest
,
and
silently
withdrew
to
a
remote
corner
of
the
great
room
,
where
she
sat
herself
on
a
couch
in
a
window
,
seeming
to
watch
the
reflection
of
the
water
as
it
made
a
silver
quivering
on
the
bars
of
the
lattice
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
,
turned
away
from
the
whole
length
of
the
apartment
,
as
if
she
were
lonely
of
her
own
haughty
choice
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
it
would
have
been
as
difficult
as
ever
to
say
,
positively
,
whether
she
avoided
the
rest
,
or
was
avoided
.
   
<EOS>
The
shadow
in
which
she
sat
,
falling
like
a
gloomy
veil
across
her
forehead
,
accorded
very
well
with
the
character
of
her
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
One
could
hardly
see
the
face
,
so
still
and
scornful
,
set
off
by
the
arched
dark
eyebrows
,
and
the
folds
of
dark
hair
,
without
wondering
what
its
expression
would
be
if
a
change
came
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
could
soften
or
relent
,
appeared
next
to
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
could
deepen
into
anger
or
any
extreme
of
defiance
,
and
that
it
must
change
in
that
direction
when
it
changed
at
all
,
would
have
been
its
peculiar
impression
upon
most
observers
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
dressed
and
trimmed
into
no
ceremony
of
expression
.
 
<EOS>
Although
not
an
open
face
,
there
was
no
pretence
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
self
-
contained
and
self
-
reliant
;
your
opinion
is
nothing
to
me
;
I
have
no
interest
in
you
,
care
nothing
for
you
,
and
see
and
hear
you
with
indifference
"
---
this
it
said
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
It
said
so
in
the
proud
eyes
,
in
the
lifted
nostril
,
in
the
handsome
but
compressed
and
even
cruel
mouth
.
<EOS>
Cover
either
two
of
those
channels
of
expression
,
and
the
third
would
have
said
so
still
.
 
<EOS>
Mask
them
all
,
and
the
mere
turn
of
the
head
would
have
shown
an
unsubduable
nature
.
   
<EOS>
Pet
had
moved
up
to
her
<EOS>
(
she
had
been
the
subject
of
remark
among
her
family
and
Mr
Clennam
,
who
were
now
the
only
other
occupants
of
the
room
)
,
and
was
standing
at
her
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
"
---
she
turned
her
eyes
,
and
Pet
faltered
---
<EOS>
"
expecting
any
one
to
meet
you
here
,
Miss
Wade
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
is
sending
to
the
Poste
Restante

<EOS>
Shall
he
have
the
pleasure
of
directing
the
messenger
to
ask
if
there
are
any
letters
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
him
,
but
I
know
there
can
be
none
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
afraid
,
"
said
Pet
,
sitting
down
beside
her
,
shyly
and
half
tenderly
,
"
that
you
will
feel
quite
deserted
when
we
are
all
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
,
"
said
Pet
,
apologetically
and
embarrassed
by
her
eyes
,
"
not
,
of
course
,
that
we
are
any
company
to
you
,
or
that
we
have
been
able
to
be
so
,
or
that
we
thought
you
wished
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
intended
to
make
it
understood
that
I
did
wish
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
.
 
<EOS>
But
---
in
short
,
"
said
<EOS>
Pet
,
timidly
touching
her
hand
as
it
lay
impassive
on
the
sofa
between
them
,
"
will
you
not
allow
Father
to
tender
you
any
slight
assistance
or
service
?
 
<EOS>
He
will
be
very
glad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
glad
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
coming
forward
with
his
wife
and
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
short
of
speaking
the
language
,
I
shall
be
delighted
to
undertake
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
"
she
returned
,
"
but
my
arrangements
are
made
,
and
I
prefer
to
go
my
own
way
in
my
own
manner
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
to
himself
,
as
he
surveyed
her
with
a
puzzled
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
character
in
that
,
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
much
used
to
the
society
of
young
ladies
,
and
I
am
afraid
I
may
not
show
my
appreciation
of
it
as
others
might
.
 
<EOS>
A
pleasant
journey
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
put
out
her
hand
,
it
seemed
,
but
that
Mr
Meagles
put
out
his
so
straight
before
her
that
she
could
not
pass
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
hers
in
it
,
and
it
lay
there
just
as
it
had
lain
upon
the
couch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
last
good
-
bye
upon
the
list
,
for
Mother
<EOS>
and
I
have
just
said
it
to
Mr
Clennam
here
,
and
<EOS>
he
only
waits
to
say
it
to
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
 
<EOS>
We
may
never
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
our
course
through
life
we
shall
meet
the
people
who
are
coming
to
meet
us
,
from
many
strange
places
and
by
many
strange
roads
,
"
was
the
composed
reply
;
"
and
what
it
is
set
to
us
to
do
to
them
,
and
what
it
is
set
to
them
to
do
to
us
,
will
all
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
in
the
manner
of
these
words
that
jarred
upon
Pet
's
ear
.
 
<EOS>
It
implied
that
what
was
to
be
done
was
necessarily
evil
,
and
it
caused
her
to
say
in
a
whisper
,
"
O
Father
!
"
<EOS>
and
to
shrink
childishly
,
in
her
spoilt
way
,
a
little
closer
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
not
lost
on
the
speaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
pretty
daughter
,
"
she
said
,
"
starts
to
think
of
such
things
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
"
looking
full
upon
her
,
"
you
may
be
sure
that
there
are
men
and
women
already
on
their
road
,
who
have
their
business
to
do
with
YOU
,
and
who
will
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
certainty
they
will
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
coming
hundreds
,
thousands
,
of
miles
over
the
sea
there
;
they
may
be
close
at
hand
now
;
they
may
be
coming
,
for
anything
you
know
or
anything
you
can
do
to
prevent
it
,
from
the
vilest
sweepings
of
this
very
town
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
the
coldest
of
farewells
,
and
with
a
certain
worn
expression
on
her
beauty
that
gave
it
,
though
scarcely
yet
in
its
prime
,
a
wasted
look
,
she
left
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
there
were
many
stairs
and
passages
that
she
had
to
traverse
in
passing
from
that
part
of
the
spacious
house
to
the
chamber
she
had
secured
for
her
own
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
almost
completed
the
journey
,
and
was
passing
along
the
gallery
in
which
her
room
was
,
she
heard
an
angry
sound
of
muttering
and
sobbing
.
 
<EOS>
A
door
stood
open
,
and
within
she
saw
the
attendant
upon
the
girl
she
had
just
left
;
the
maid
with
the
curious
name
.
   
<EOS>
She
stood
still
,
to
look
at
this
maid
.
 
<EOS>
A
sullen
,
passionate
girl
!
<EOS>
Her
rich
black
hair
was
all
about
her
face
,
her
face
was
flushed
and
hot
,
and
as
she
sobbed
and
raged
,
she
plucked
at
her
lips
with
an
unsparing
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Selfish
brutes
!
"
said
the
girl
,
sobbing
and
heaving
between
whiles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
caring
what
becomes
of
me
!
 
<EOS>
Leaving
me
here
hungry
and
thirsty
and
tired
,
to
starve
,
for
anything
they
care
!
 
<EOS>
Beasts
!
<EOS>
Devils
!
 
<EOS>
Wretches
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
poor
girl
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
up
suddenly
,
with
reddened
eyes
,
and
with
her
hands
suspended
,
in
the
act
of
pinching
her
neck
,
freshly
disfigured
with
great
scarlet
blots
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
to
you
what
's
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
n't
signify
to
any
one

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
yes
<EOS>
it
does
;
I
am
sorry
to
see
you
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
sorry
,
"
said
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
glad
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
are
glad
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
like
this
but
twice
over
in
the
quarantine
yonder
;
and
both
times
you
found
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Afraid
of
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
You
seem
to
come
like
my
own
anger
,
my
own
malice
,
my
own
---
<EOS>
whatever
it
is
---
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
ill
-
used
<EOS>
,
I
am
ill
-
used
,
I
am
ill
-
used
!
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
sobs
and
the
tears
,
and
the
tearing
hand
,
which
had
all
been
suspended
together
since
the
first
surprise
,
went
on
together
anew
.
   
<EOS>
The
visitor
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
strange
attentive
smile
.
<EOS>
It
was
wonderful
to
see
the
fury
of
the
contest
in
the
girl
,
and
the
bodily
struggle
she
made
as
if
she
were
rent
by
the
Demons
of
old
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
younger
than
she
is
by
two
or
three
years
,
and
yet
it
's
me
that
looks
after
her
,
as
if
I
was
old
,
and
<EOS>
it
's
she
that
's
always
petted
and
called
Baby
!
 
<EOS>
I
detest
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
her
!
 
<EOS>
They
make
a
fool
of
her
,
they
spoil
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
thinks
of
nothing
but
herself
<EOS>
,
she
thinks
no
more
of
me
than
if
I
was
a
stock
and
a
stone
!
"
 
<EOS>
So
the
girl
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
patience
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
WON'T
have
patience
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
they
take
much
care
of
themselves
,
and
little
or
none
of
you
,
you
must
not
mind
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
WILL
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Be
more
prudent
.
 
<EOS>
You
forget
your
dependent
position
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
some
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
bear
it
<EOS>
;
I
ca
n't
bear
it
;
I
shall
die
if
I
try

bear
it

"
   
<EOS>
The
observer
stood
with
her
hand
upon
her
own
bosom
,
looking
at
the
girl
,
as
one
afflicted
with
a
diseased
part
might
curiously
watch
the
dissection
and
exposition
of
an
analogous
case
.
   
<EOS>
The
girl
raged
and
battled
with
all
the
force
of
her
youth
and
fulness
of
life
,
until
by
little
and
little
her
passionate
exclamations
trailed
off
into
broken
murmurs
as
if
she
were
in
pain
.
 
<EOS>
By
corresponding
degrees
she
sank
into
a
chair
,
then
upon
her
knees
,
then
upon
the
ground
beside
the
bed
,
drawing
the
coverlet
with
her
,
half
to
hide
her
shamed
head
and
wet
hair
in
it
,
and
half
,
as
it
seemed
,
to
embrace
it
,
rather
than
have
nothing
to
take
to
her
repentant
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
away
from
me
,
go
away
from
me
!
 
<EOS>
When
my
temper
comes
upon
me
,
I
am
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
might
keep
it
off
if
I
only
tried
hard
enough
,
and
sometimes
I
do
try
hard
enough
,
and
at
other
times
I
do
n't
and
wo
n't

<EOS>
What
have
I
said
!
 
<EOS>
I
knew
when
I
said
it
,
it
was
all
lies
.
<EOS>
They
think
I
am
being
taken
care
of
somewhere
,
and
have
all
I
want
.
   
<EOS>
They
are
nothing
but
good
to
me

<EOS>
I
love
them
dearly
;
no
people
could
ever
be
kinder
to
a
thankless
creature

they
always
are
to
me

<EOS>
Do
,
do
go
away
,
for
I
am
afraid
of
you

<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
myself
when
I
feel
my
temper
coming
,
and
I
am
as
much
afraid
of
you

<EOS>
Go
away
from
me

and
let
me
pray
and
cry
myself
better

<EOS>
The
day
passed
on
;
and
again
the
wide
stare
stared
itself
out
;
and
the
hot
night
was
on
Marseilles
;
and
through
it
the
caravan
of
the
morning
,
all
dispersed
,
went
their
appointed
ways
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
ever
by
day
and
night
,
under
the
sun
and
under
the
stars
,
climbing
the
dusty
hills
and
toiling
along
the
weary
plains
,
journeying
by
land
and
journeying
by
sea
,
coming
and
going
so
strangely
,
to
meet
and
to
act
and
react
on
one
another
,
move
all
we
restless
travellers
through
the
pilgrimage
of

<EOS>
Home
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
Sunday
evening
in
London
,
gloomy
,
close
,
and
stale
.
<EOS>
Maddening
church
bells
of
all
degrees
of
dissonance
,
sharp
and
flat
,
cracked
and
clear
,
fast
and
slow
,
made
the
brick
-
and
-
mortar
echoes
hideous
.
 
<EOS>
Melancholy
streets
,
in
a
penitential
garb
of
soot
,
steeped
the
souls
of
the
people
who
were
condemned
to
look
at
them
out
of
windows
,
in
dire
despondency
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
thoroughfare
,
up
almost
every
alley
,
and
down
almost
every
turning
,
some
doleful
bell
was
throbbing
,
jerking
,
tolling
,
as
if
the
Plague
were
in
the
city
and
the
dead
-
carts
were
going
round
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
bolted
and
barred
that
could
by
possibility
furnish
relief
to
an
overworked
people
.
 
<EOS>
No
pictures
,
no
unfamiliar
animals
,
no
rare
plants
or
flowers
,
no
natural
or
artificial
wonders
of
the
ancient
world
---
all
TABOO
with
that
enlightened
strictness
,
that
the
ugly
South
Sea
gods
in
the
British
Museum
might
have
supposed
themselves
at
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
to
see
but
streets
,
streets
,
streets
.
<EOS>
Nothing
to
breathe
but
streets
,
streets
,
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
to
change
the
brooding
mind
,
or
raise
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
for
the
spent
toiler
to
do
,
but
to
compare
the
monotony
of
his
seventh
day
with
the
monotony
of
his
six
days
,
think
what
a
weary
life
he
led
,
and
make
the
best
of
it
---
or
the
worst
,
according
to
the
probabilities
.
   
<EOS>
At
such
a
happy
time
,
so
propitious
to
the
interests
of
religion
and
morality
,
Mr
Arthur
Clennam
,
newly
arrived
from
Marseilles
by
way
of
Dover
,
and
by
Dover
coach
the
Blue
-
eyed
Maid
,
sat
in
the
window
of
a
coffee
-
house
on
Ludgate
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
responsible
houses
surrounded
him
,
frowning
as
heavily
on
the
streets
they
composed
,
as
if
they
were
every
one
inhabited
by
the
ten
young
men
of
the
Calender
's
story
,
who
blackened
their
faces
and
bemoaned
their
miseries
every
night
.
 
<EOS>
Fifty
thousand
lairs
surrounded
him
where
people
lived
so
unwholesomely
that
fair
water
put
into
their
crowded
rooms
on
Saturday
night
,
would
be
corrupt
on
Sunday
morning
;
albeit
my
lord
,
their
county
member
,
was
amazed
that
they
failed
to
sleep
in
company
with
their
butcher
's
meat
.
 
<EOS>
Miles
of
close
wells
and
pits
of
houses
,
where
the
inhabitants
gasped
for
air
,
stretched
far
away
towards
every
point
of
the
compass
.
<EOS>
Through
the
heart
of
the
town
a
deadly
sewer
ebbed
and
flowed
,
in
the
place
of
a
fine
fresh
river
.
 
<EOS>
What
secular
want
could
the
million
or
so
of
human
beings
whose
daily
labour
,
six
days
in
the
week
,
lay
among
these
Arcadian
objects
,
from
the
sweet
sameness
of
which
they
had
no
escape
between
the
cradle
and
the
grave
---
what
secular
want
could
they
possibly
have
upon
their
seventh
day
?
<EOS>
Clearly
they
could
want
nothing
but
a
stringent
policeman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Arthur
Clennam
sat
in
the
window
of
the
coffee
-
house
on
Ludgate
Hill
,
counting
one
of
the
neighbouring
bells
,
making
sentences
and
burdens
of
songs
out
of
it
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
wondering
how
many
sick
people
it
might
be
the
death
of
in
the
course
of
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
hour
approached
,
its
changes
of
measure
made
it
more
and
more
exasperating
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
quarter
,
it
went
off
into
a
condition
of
deadly
-
lively
importunity
,
urging
the
populace
in
a
voluble
manner
to
Come
to
church
,
Come
to
church
,
Come
to
church
!
<EOS>
At
the
ten
minutes
,
it
became
aware
that
the
congregation
would
be
scanty
,
and
slowly
hammered
out
in
low
spirits
,
<EOS>
They
WON'T
come
,
they
WON'T
come
,
they
WON'T
come
!
 
<EOS>
At
the
five
minutes
,
it
abandoned
hope
,
and
shook
every
house
in
the
neighbourhood
for
three
hundred
seconds
,
with
one
dismal
swing
per
second
,
as
a
groan
of
despair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
said
Clennam
,
when
the
hour
struck
,
and
the
bell
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
But
its
sound
had
revived
a
long
train
of
miserable
Sundays
,
and
the
procession
would
not
stop
with
the
bell
,
but
continued
to
march
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forgive
me
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
those
who
trained
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
have
hated
this
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
the
dreary
Sunday
of
his
childhood
,
when
he
sat
with
his
hands
before
him
,
scared
out
of
his
senses
by
a
horrible
tract
which
commenced
business
with
the
poor
child
by
asking
him
in
its
title
,
why
he
was
going
to
Perdition
?
---
<EOS>
a
piece
of
curiosity
that
he
really
,
in
a
frock
and
drawers
,
was
not
in
a
condition
to
satisfy
---
and
which
,
for
the
further
attraction
of
his
infant
mind
,
had
a
parenthesis
in
every
other
line
with
some
such
hiccupping
reference
as

There
was
the
sleepy
Sunday
of
his
boyhood
,
when
,
like
a
military
deserter
,
he
was
marched
to
chapel
by
a
picquet
of
teachers
three
times
a
day
,
morally
handcuffed
to
another
boy
;
and
when
he
would
willingly
have
bartered
two
meals
of
indigestible
sermon
for
another
ounce
or
two
of
inferior
mutton
at
his
scanty
dinner
in
the
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
interminable
Sunday
of
his
nonage
;
when
his
mother
,
stern
of
face
and
unrelenting
of
heart
,
would
sit
all
day
behind
a
Bible
---
bound
,
like
her
own
construction
of
it
,
in
the
hardest
,
barest
,
and
straitest
boards
,
with
one
dinted
ornament
on
the
cover
like
the
drag
of
a
chain
,
and
a
wrathful
sprinkling
of
red
upon
the
edges
of
the
leaves
---
as
if
it
,
of
all
books
!
 
<EOS>
were
a
fortification
against
sweetness
of
temper
,
natural
affection
,
and
gentle
intercourse
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
resentful
Sunday
of
a
little
later
,
when
he
sat
down
glowering
and
glooming
through
the
tardy
length
of
the
day
,
with
a
sullen
sense
of
injury
in
his
heart
,
and
no
more
real
knowledge
of
the
beneficent
history
of
the
New
Testament
than
if
he
had
been
bred
among
idolaters
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
legion
of
Sundays
,
all
days
of
unserviceable
bitterness
and
mortification
,
slowly
passing
before
him
.
"
<EOS>
Beg

"
said
a
brisk
waiter
,
rubbing
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wish

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>

my

to

said
Clennam
,
rousing
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
thinking
of
what
I
said
;
I
answered
mechanically
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
He
sat
in
the
same
place
as
the
day
died
,
looking
at
the
dull
houses
opposite
,
and
thinking
,
if
the
disembodied
spirits
of
former
inhabitants
were
ever
conscious
of
them
,
how
they
must
pity
themselves
for
their
old
places
of
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
a
face
would
appear
behind
the
dingy
glass
of
a
window
,
and
would
fade
away
into
the
gloom
as
if
it
had
seen
enough
of
life
and
had
vanished
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
the
rain
began
to
fall
in
slanting
lines
between
him
and
those
houses
,
and
people
began
to
collect
under
cover
of
the
public
passage
opposite
,
and
to
look
out
hopelessly
at
the
sky
as
the
rain
dropped
thicker
and
faster
.
 
<EOS>
Then
wet
umbrellas
began
to
appear
,
draggled
skirts
,
and
mud
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
mud
had
been
doing
with
itself
,
or
where
it
came
from
,
who
could
say
?
 
<EOS>
But
it
seemed
to
collect
in
a
moment
,
as
a
crowd
will
,
and
in
five
minutes
to
have
splashed
all
the
sons
and
daughters
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
The
lamplighter
was
going
his
rounds
now
;
and
as
the
fiery
jets
sprang
up
under
his
touch
,
one
might
have
fancied
them
astonished
at
being
suffered
to
introduce
any
show
of
brightness
into
such
a
dismal
scene
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Arthur
Clennam
took
up
his
hat
and
buttoned
his
coat
,
and
walked
out
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
country
,
the
rain
would
have
developed
a
thousand
fresh
scents
,
and
every
drop
would
have
had
its
bright
association
with
some
beautiful
form
of
growth
or
life
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
city
,
it
developed
only
foul
stale
smells
,
and
was
a
sickly
,
lukewarm
,
dirt
-
stained
,
wretched
addition
to
the
gutters
.
   
<EOS>
He
crossed
by
St
Paul
's
and
went
down
,
at
a
long
angle
,
almost
to
the
water
's
edge
,
through
some
of
the
crooked
and
descending
streets
which
lie
(
and
lay
more
crookedly
and
closely
then
)
between
the
river
and
Cheapside
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
,
now
the
mouldy
hall
of
some
obsolete
Worshipful
Company
,
now
the
illuminated
windows
of
a
Congregationless
Church
that
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
some
adventurous
Belzoni
to
dig
it
out
and
discover
its
history
;
passing
silent
warehouses
and
wharves
,
and
here
and
there
a
narrow
alley
leading
to
the
river
,
where
a
wretched
little
bill
,
FOUND
DROWNED
,
was
weeping
on
the
wet
wall
;
he
came
at
last
to
the
house
he
sought
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
brick
house
,
so
dingy
as
to
be
all
but
black
,
standing
by
itself
within
a
gateway
.
 
<EOS>
Before
it
,
a
square
court
-
yard
where
a
shrub
or
two
and
a
patch
of
grass
were
as
rank
(
which
is
saying
much
)
as
the
iron
railings
enclosing
them
were
rusty
;
behind
it
,
a
jumble
of
roots
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
double
house
,
with
long
,
narrow
,
heavily
-
framed
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Many
years
ago
,
it
had
had
it
in
its
mind
to
slide
down
sideways
;
it
had
been
propped
up
,
however
,
and
was
leaning
on
some
half
-
dozen
gigantic
crutches
:
which
gymnasium
for
the
neighbouring
cats
,
weather
-
stained
,
smoke
-
blackened
,
and
overgrown
with
weeds
,
appeared
in
these
latter
days
to
be
no
very
sure
reliance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
changed
,
"
said
the
traveller
,
stopping
to
look
round
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dark
and
miserable
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
A
light
in
my
mother
's
window
,
which
seems
never
to
have
been
extinguished
since
I
came
home
twice
a
year
from
school
,
and
dragged
my
box
over
this
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
went
up
to
the
door
,
which
had
a
projecting
canopy
in
carved
work
of
festooned
jack
-
towels
and
children
's
heads
with
water
on
the
brain
,
designed
after
a
once
-
popular
monumental
pattern
,
and
knocked
.
 
<EOS>
A
shuffling
step
was
soon
heard
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
hall
,
and
the
door
was
opened
by
an
old
man
,
bent
and
dried
,
but
with
keen
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
a
candle
in
his
hand
,
and
he
held
it
up
for
a
moment
to
assist
his
keen
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr
Arthur
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
without
any
emotion
,
"
you
are
come
at
last
?
 
<EOS>
Step
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Arthur
stepped
in
and
shut
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
figure
is
filled
out
,
and
set
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
turning
to
look
at
him
with
the
light
raised
again
,
and
shaking
his
head
;
"
but
you
do
n't
come
up
to
your
father
in
my
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
yet
your
mother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
my
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
as
she
always
is
now
.
 
<EOS>
Keeps
her
room
when
not
actually
bedridden
,
and
has
n't
been
out
of
it
fifteen
times
in
as
many
years
,
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
had
walked
into
a
spare
,
meagre
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
had
put
the
candlestick
upon
the
table
,
and
,
supporting
his
right
elbow
with
his
left
hand
,
was
smoothing
his
leathern
jaws
while
he
looked
at
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitor
offered
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
took
it
coldly
enough
,
and
seemed
to
prefer
his
jaws
,
to
which
he
returned
as
soon
as
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
if
your
mother
will
approve
of
your
coming
home
on
the
Sabbath
,
Arthur
,
"
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
warily
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
have
me
go
away
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
master
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
what
\I\
would
have
.
<EOS>
I
have
stood
between
your
father
and
mother
for
a
number
of
years
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
stand
between
your
mother
and
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
her
that
I
have
come
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Arthur
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
her
that
you
have
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
Please
to
wait
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
find
the
room
changed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
another
candle
from
a
cupboard
,
lighted
it
,
left
the
first
on
the
table
,
and
went
upon
his
errand
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
short
,
bald
old
man
,
in
a
high
-
shouldered
black
coat
and
waistcoat
,
drab
breeches
,
and
long
drab
gaiters
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
,
from
his
dress
,
have
been
either
clerk
or
servant
,
and
in
fact
had
long
been
both
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
about
him
in
the
way
of
decoration
but
a
watch
,
which
was
lowered
into
the
depths
of
its
proper
pocket
by
an
old
black
ribbon
,
and
had
a
tarnished
copper
key
moored
above
it
,
to
show
where
it
was
sunk
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
was
awry
,
and
he
had
a
one
-
sided
,
crab
-
like
way
with
him
,
as
if
his
foundations
had
yielded
at
about
the
same
time
as
those
of
the
house
,
and
he
ought
to
have
been
propped
up
in
a
similar
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
weak
am
I
,
"
said
Arthur
Clennam
,
when
he
was
gone
,
"
that
I
could
shed
tears
at
this
reception
!
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
never
experienced
anything
else
;
who
have
never
expected
anything
else
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
not
only
could
,
but
did
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
momentary
yielding
of
a
nature
that
had
been
disappointed
from
the
dawn
of
its
perceptions
,
but
had
not
quite
given
up
all
its
hopeful
yearnings
yet
.
 
<EOS>
He
subdued
it
,
took
up
the
candle
,
and
examined
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
articles
of
furniture
were
in
their
old
places
;
the
Plagues
of
Egypt
,
much
the
dimmer
for
the
fly
and
smoke
plagues
of
London
,
were
framed
and
glazed
upon
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
old
cellaret
with
nothing
in
it
,
lined
with
lead
,
like
a
sort
of
coffin
in
compartments
;
there
was
the
old
dark
closet
,
also
with
nothing
in
it
,
of
which
he
had
been
many
a
time
the
sole
contents
,
in
days
of
punishment
,
when
he
had
regarded
it
as
the
veritable
entrance
to
that
bourne
to
which
the
tract
had
found
him
galloping
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
large
,
hard
-
featured
clock
on
the
sideboard
,
which
he
used
to
see
bending
its
figured
brows
upon
him
with
a
savage
joy
when
he
was
behind
-
hand
with
his
lessons
,
and
which
,
when
it
was
wound
up
once
a
week
with
an
iron
handle
,
used
to
sound
as
if
it
were
growling
in
ferocious
anticipation
of
the
miseries
into
which
it
would
bring
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
was
the
old
man
come
back
,
saying
,
"
Arthur
,
I
'll
go
before
and
light
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
followed
him
up
the
staircase
,
which
was
panelled
off
into
spaces
like
so
many
mourning
tablets
,
into
a
dim
bed
-
chamber
,
the
floor
of
which
had
gradually
so
sunk
and
settled
,
that
the
fire
-
place
was
in
a
dell
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
black
bier
-
like
sofa
in
this
hollow
,
propped
up
behind
with
one
great
angular
black
bolster
like
the
block
at
a
state
execution
in
the
good
old
times
,
sat
his
mother
in
a
widow
's
dress
.
   
<EOS>
She
and
his
father
had
been
at
variance
from
his
earliest
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
To
sit
speechless
himself
in
the
midst
of
rigid
silence
,
glancing
in
dread
from
the
one
averted
face
to
the
other
,
had
been
the
peacefullest
occupation
of
his
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
him
one
glassy
kiss
,
and
four
stiff
fingers
muffled
in
worsted
.
<EOS>
This
embrace
concluded
,
he
sat
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
her
little
table
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
,
as
there
had
been
night
and
day
for
fifteen
years
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
kettle
on
the
hob
,
as
there
had
been
night
and
day
for
fifteen
years
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
mound
of
damped
ashes
on
the
top
of
the
fire
,
and
another
little
mound
swept
together
under
the
grate
,
as
there
had
been
night
and
day
for
fifteen
years
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
smell
of
black
dye
in
the
airless
room
,
which
the
fire
had
been
drawing
out
of
the
crape
and
stuff
of
the
widow
's
dress
for
fifteen
months
,
and
out
of
the
bier
-
like
sofa
for
fifteen
years
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
this
is
a
change
from
your
old
active
habits
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
world
has
narrowed
to
these
dimensions
,
Arthur
,
"
she
rep
lied
,
glancing
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
for
me
that
I
never
set
my
heart
upon
its
hollow
vanities
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
influence
of
her
presence
and
her
stern
strong
voice
,
so
gathered
about
her
son
,
that
he
felt
conscious
of
a
renewal
of
the
timid
chill
and
reserve
of
his
childhood
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
never
leave
your
room
,
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
with
my
rheumatic
affection
,
and
what
with
its
attendant
debility
or
nervous
weakness
---
names
are
of
no
matter
now
---
I
have
lost
the
use
of
my
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
leave
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
outside
this
door

tell
him
for

long

"
she
said
,
speaking
over
her
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
dozen
year
next
Christmas
,
"
returned
a
cracked
voice
out
of
the
dimness
behind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
Affery
?
"
said
Arthur
,
looking
towards
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
cracked
voice
replied
that
it
was
Affery
:
and
an
old
woman
came
forward
into
what
doubtful
light
there
was
,
and
kissed
her
hand
once
;
then
subsided
again
into
the
dimness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
able
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
with
a
slight
motion
of
her
worsted
-
muffled
right
hand
toward
a
chair
on
wheels
,
standing
before
<EOS>
a
tall
writing
cabinet
close
shut
up
,
"
I
am
able
to
attend
to
my
business
duties
,
and
I
am
thankful
for
the
privilege
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
privilege
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
more
of
business
on
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
bad
night
,
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
mother
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
it
snow
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Snow
,
mother
?
 
<EOS>
And
we
only
yet
in
September
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
seasons
are
alike
to
me
,
"
she
returned
,
with
a
grim
kind
of
luxuriousness
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
summer
and
winter
,
shut
up
here
.
   
<EOS>
The
Lord
has
been
pleased
to
put
me
beyond
all
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
her
cold
grey
eyes
and
her
cold
grey
hair
,
and
her
immovable
face
,
as
stiff
as
the
folds
of
her
stony
head
-
dress
,
---
her
being
beyond
the
reach
of
the
seasons
<EOS>
seemed
but
a
fit
sequence
to
her
being
beyond
the
reach
of
all
changing
emotions
.
   
<EOS>
On
her
little
table
lay
two
or
three
books
,
her
handkerchief
,
a
pair
of
steel
spectacles
newly
taken
off
,
and
an
old
-
fashioned
gold
watch
in
a
heavy
double
case
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
last
object
her
son
's
eyes
and
her
own
now
rested
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
you
received
the
packet
I
sent
you
on
my
father
's
death
,
safely
,
mother
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
my
father
to
show
so
much
anxiety
on
any
subject
,
as
that
his
watch
should
be
sent
straight
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
keep
it
here
as
a
remembrance
of
your
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
until
the
last
,
that
he
expressed
the
wish
;
when
he
could
only
put
his
hand
upon
it
,
and
very
indistinctly
say
to
me
"
your
mother
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
moment
before
,
I
thought
him
wandering
in
his
mind
,
as
he
had
been
for
many
hours
<EOS>
---
I
think
he
had
no
consciousness
of
pain
in
his
short
illness
---
when
I
saw
him
turn
himself
in
his
bed
and
try
to
open
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
your
father
,
then
,
not
wandering
in
his
mind
when
he
tried
to
open
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
quite
sensible
at
that
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
shook
her
head
;
whether
in
dismissal
of
the
deceased
or
opposing
herself
to
her
son
's
opinion
,
was
not
clearly
expressed
.
   
<EOS>
"
After
my
father
's
death
I
opened
it
myself
,
thinking
there
might
be
,
for
anything
I
knew
,
some
memorandum
there
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
I
need
not
tell
you
,
mother
,
there
was
nothing
but
the
old
silk
watch
-
paper
worked
in
beads
,
which
you
found
(
no
doubt
)
in
its
place
between
the
cases
,
where
I
found
and
left
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
signified
assent
;
then
added
,
"
No
more
of
business
on
this
day
,
"
and
then
added
,
"
Affery
,
it
is
nine
o'clock
.
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
old
woman
cleared
the
little
table
,
went
out
of
the
room
,
and
quickly
returned
with
a
tray
on
which
was
a
dish
of
little
rusks
and
a
small
precise
pat
of
butter
,
cool
,
symmetrical
,
white
,
and
plump
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
who
had
been
standing
by
the
door
in
one
attitude
during
the
whole
interview
,
looking
at
the
mother
up
-
stairs
as
he
had
looked
at
the
son
down
-
stairs
,
went
out
at
the
same
time
,
and
,
after
a
longer
absence
,
returned
with
another
tray
on
which
was
the
greater
part
of
a
bottle
of
port
wine
(
which
,
to
judge
by
his
panting
,
he
had
brought
from
the
cellar
)
,
a
lemon
,
a
sugar
-
basin
,
and
a
spice
box
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
materials
and
the
aid
of
the
kettle
,
he
filled
a
tumbler
with
a
hot
and
odorous
mixture
,
measured
out
and
compounded
with
as
much
nicety
as
a
physician
's
prescription
.
 
<EOS>
Into
this
mixture
Mrs
Clennam
dipped
certain
of
the
rusks
,
and
ate
them
;
while
the
old
woman
buttered
certain
other
of
the
rusks
,
which
were
to
be
eaten
alone
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
invalid
had
eaten
all
the
rusks
and
drunk
all
the
mixture
,
the
two
trays
were
removed
;
and
the
books
and
the
candle
,
watch
,
handkerchief
,
and
spectacles
were
replaced
upon
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
put
on
the
spectacles
and
read
certain
passages
aloud
from
a
book
---
sternly
,
fiercely
,
wrathfully
---
praying
that
her
enemies
(
she
made
them
by
her
tone
and
manner
expressly
hers
)
might
be
put
to
the
edge
of
the
sword
,
consumed
by
fire
,
smitten
by
plagues
and
leprosy
,
that
their
bones
might
be
ground
to
dust
,
and
that
they
might
be
utterly
exterminated
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
read
on
,
years
seemed
to
fall
away
from
her
son
like
the
imaginings
of
a
dream
,
and
all
the
old
dark
horrors
of
his
usual
preparation
for
the
sleep
of
an
innocent
child
to
overshadow
him
.
   
<EOS>
She
shut
the
book
and
remained
for
a
little
time
with
her
face
shaded
by
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
the
old
man
,
otherwise
still
unchanged
   
in
attitude
;
so
,
probably
,
did
the
old
woman
in
her
dimmer
part
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
sick
woman
was
ready
for
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
Affery
will
see
to
your
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
Only
touch
me
,
for
my
hand
is
tender
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
touched
the
worsted
muffling
of
her
hand
---
<EOS>
that
was
nothing
;
if
his
mother
had
been
sheathed
in
brass
there
would
have
been
no
new
barrier
between
them
---
and
followed
the
old
man
and
woman
down
-
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
The
latter
asked
him
,
when
they
were
alone
together
among
the
heavy
shadows
of
the
dining
-
room
,
would
he
have
some
supper
?
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Affery
,
no
supper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
if
you
like
,
"
said
Affery
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
her
tomorrow
's
partridge
in
the
larder
---
her
first
this
year
;
say
the
word
and
<EOS>
I
'll
cook
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
No
,
he
had
not
long
dined
,
and
could
eat
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
something
to
drink
,
then
,
"
said
Affery
;
"
you
shall
have
some
of
her
bottle
of
port
,
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
Jeremiah
that
you
ordered
me
to
bring
it
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
No
;
nor
would
he
have
that
,
either
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
reason
,
Arthur
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
bending
over
him
to
whisper
,
"
that
because
I
am
afeared
of
my
life
of
'em
,
you
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
got
half
the
property
,
have
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
do
n't
you
be
cowed
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
clever
,
Arthur
,
an't
you
?
"
<EOS>
He
nodded
,
as
she
seemed
to
expect
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
"
<EOS>
Then
stand
up
against
them
!
 
<EOS>
She
's
awful
clever
,
and
none
but
a
clever
one
durst
say
a
word
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
HE
'S
a
clever
one
---
<EOS>
oh
,
he
's
a
clever
one
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
he
gives
it
her
when
he
has
a
mind
to't
,
he
does
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
husband
does
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
?
 
<EOS>
It
makes
me
shake
from
head
to
foot
,
to
hear
him
give
it
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
,
Jeremiah
Flintwinch
,
can
conquer
even
your
mother
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
he
be
but
a
clever
one
to
do
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
shuffling
footstep
coming
towards
them
caused
her
to
retreat
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Though
a
tall
,
hard
-
favoured
,
sinewy
old
woman
,
who
in
her
youth
might
have
enlisted
in
the
Foot
Guards
without
much
fear
of
discovery
<EOS>
,
she
collapsed
before
the
little
keen
-
eyed
crab
-
like
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Affery
,
"
said
he
,
"
now
,
woman
,
what
are
you
doing
?
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
find
Master
Arthur
something
or
another
to
pick
at
?
"
   
<EOS>
Master
Arthur
repeated
his
recent
refusal
to
pick
at
anything
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
then
,
"
said
the
old
man
;
"
make
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Stir
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
neck
was
so
twisted
that
the
knotted
ends
of
his
white
cravat
usually
dangled
under
one
ear
;
his
natural
acerbity
and
energy
,
always
contending
with
a
second
nature
of
habitual
repression
,
gave
his
features
a
swollen
and
suffused
look
;
and
altogether
,
he
had
a
weird
appearance
of
having
hanged
himself
at
one
time
or
other
,
and
of
having
gone
about
ever
since
,
halter
and
all
,
exactly
as
some
timely
hand
had
cut
him
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
bitter
words
together
to
-
morrow
,
Arthur
;
you
and
your
mother
,
"
said
Jeremiah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
having
given
up
the
business
on
your
father
's
death
---
which
she
suspects
,
though
we
have
left
it
to
you
to
tell
her
---
wo
n't
go
off
smoothly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
up
everything
in
life
for
the
business
,
and
the
time
came
for
me
to
give
up
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jeremiah
,
evidently
meaning
Bad
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
good
!
 
<EOS>
only
do
n't
expect
me
to
stand
between
your
mother
and
you
,
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
between
your
mother
and
your
father
,
fending
off
this
,
and
fending
off
that
,
and
getting
crushed
and
pounded
betwixt
em
;
and
I
've
done
with
such
work
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
be
asked
to
begin
it
again
for
me
,
Jeremiah
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
;
because
I
should
have
had
to
decline
it
,
if
I
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
enough
---
as
your
mother
says
---
and
more
than
enough
of
such
matters
on
a
Sabbath
night
.
 
<EOS>
Affery
,
woman
,
have
you
found
what
you
want
yet
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
been
collecting
sheets
and
blankets
from
a
press
,
and
hastened
to
gather
them
up
,
and
to
reply
,
"
Yes
,
Jeremiah
.
"
 
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
helped
her
by
carrying
the
load
himself
,
wished
the
old
man
good
night
,
and
went
up
-
stairs
with
her
to
the
top
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
They
mounted
up
and
up
,
through
the
musty
smell
of
an
old
close
house
,
little
used
,
to
a
large
garret
bed
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Meagre
and
spare
,
like
all
the
other
rooms
,
it
was
even
uglier
and
grimmer
than
the
rest
,
by
being
the
place
of
banishment
for
the
worn
-
out
furniture
.
<EOS>
Its
movables
were
ugly
old
chairs
with
worn
-
out
seats
,
and
ugly
old
chairs
without
any
seats
;
a
threadbare
patternless
carpet
,
a
maimed
table
,
a
crippled
wardrobe
,
a
lean
set
of
fire
-
irons
like
the
skeleton
of
a
set
deceased
,
a
washing
-
stand
that
looked
as
if
it
had
stood
for
ages
in
a
hail
of
dirty
soapsuds
,
and
a
bedstead
with
four
bare
atomies
of
posts
,
each
terminating
in
a
spike
,
as
if
for
the
dismal
accommodation
of
lodgers
who
might
prefer
to
impale
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
opened
the
long
low
window
,
and
looked
out
upon
the
old
blasted
and
blackened
forest
of
chimneys
,
and
the
old
red
glare
in
the
sky
,
which
had
seemed
to
him
once
upon
a
time
but
a
nightly
reflection
of
the
fiery
environment
that
was
presented
to
his
childish
fancy
in
all
directions
,
let
it
look
where
it
would
.
   
<EOS>
He
drew
in
his
head
again
,
sat
down
at
the
bedside
,
and
looked
on
at
Affery
Flintwinch
making
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Affery
,
you
were
not
married
when
I
went
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
screwed
her
mouth
into
the
form
of
saying
"
No
,
"
shook
her
head
,
and
proceeded
to
get
a
pillow
into
its
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
it
happen
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Jeremiah
,
o
'
course
,
"
said
Affery
,
with
an
end
of
the
pillow
-
case
between
her
teeth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
proposed
it
,
but
how
did
it
all
come
about
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
that
neither
of
you
would
have
married
;
least
of
all
should
I
have
thought
of
your
marrying
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
should
I
,
"
said
Mrs
Flintwinch
,
tying
the
pillow
tightly
in
its
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
When
did
you
begin
to
think
otherwise
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
begun
to
think
otherwise
at
all
,
"
said
Mrs
Flintwinch
.
   
<EOS>
Seeing
,
as
she
patted
the
pillow
into
its
place
on
the
bolster
,
that
he
was
still
looking
at
her
as
if
waiting
for
the
rest
of
her
reply
<EOS>
,
she
gave
it
a
great
poke
in
the
middle
,
and
asked
,
"
How
could
I
help
myself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
could
you
help
yourself
from
being
married
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
'
course
,
"
said
Mrs
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
no
doing
o
'
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I'D
never
thought
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
got
something
to
do
,
without
thinking
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
She
kept
me
to
it
(
as
well
as
he
)
when
she
could
go
about
,
and
she
could
go
about
then
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
echoed
Mrs
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
said
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
considering
?
 
<EOS>
If
them
two
clever
ones
have
made
up
their
minds
to
it
,
what
's
left
for
me
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
it
my
mother
's
project
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
bless
you
,
Arthur
,
and
forgive
me
the
wish
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Affery
,
speaking
always
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
they
had
n't
been
both
of
a
mind
in
it
,
how
could
it
ever
have
been
?
 
<EOS>
Jeremiah
never
courted
me
;
t'ant
likely
that
he
would
,
after
living
in
the
house
with
me
and
ordering
me
about
for
as
many
years
as
he
'd
done
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
to
me
one
day
<EOS>
,
he
said
,
"
Affery
,
"
he
said
,
"
now
I
am
going
to
tell
you
something
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
the
name
of
Flintwinch
?
"
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
says
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
because
you
're
going
to
take
it
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
says
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jere
-
MI
-
ah
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
's
a
clever
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Flintwinch
went
on
to
spread
the
upper
sheet
over
the
bed
,
and
the
blanket
over
that
,
and
the
counterpane
over
that
,
as
if
she
had
quite
concluded
her
story
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
Arthur
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
echoed
Mrs
Flintwinch
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
could
I
help
myself
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
to
me
,
"
Affery
,
you
and
me
must
be
married
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
why
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
failing
in
health
,
and
she
'll
want
pretty
constant
attendance
up
in
her
room
,
and
we
shall
have
to
be
much
with
her
,
and
there
'll
be
nobody
about
now
<EOS>
but
ourselves
when
we
're
away
from
her
,
and
altogether
it
will
be
more
convenient
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
of
my
opinion
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
"
so
if
you
'll
put
your
bonnet
on
next
Monday
morning
at
eight
,
we
'll
get
it
over
.
"
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Flintwinch
tucked
up
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
repeated
Mrs
Flintwinch
,
"
I
think
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
sits
me
down
and
says
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Jeremiah
then
says
to
me
,
"
As
to
banns
,
next
Sunday
being
the
third
time
of
asking
(
for
I
've
put
'em
up
a
fortnight
)
,
is
my
reason
for
naming
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
speak
to
you
about
it
herself
,
and
now
she
'll
find
you
prepared
,
Affery
.
<EOS>
"
That
same
day
she
spoke
to
me
,
and
she
said
,
"
So
,
Affery
,
I
understand
that
you
and
Jeremiah
are
going
to
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
,
and
so
are
you
,
with
reason
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
good
thing
for
you
,
and
very
welcome
under
the
circumstances
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
sensible
man
,
and
a
trustworthy
man
,
and
a
persevering
man
,
and
a
pious
man
.
<EOS>
"
What
could
I
say
when
it
had
come
to
that
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
if
it
had
been
---
a
smothering
instead
of
a
wedding
,
"
Mrs
Flintwinch
cast
about
in
her
mind
with
great
pains
for
this
form
of
expression
,
"
I
could
n't
have
said
a
word
upon
it
,
against
them
two
clever
ones
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
good
faith
,
I
believe
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
so
you
may
,
Arthur
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Affery
,
what
girl
was
that
in
my
mother
's
room
just
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Girl
?
"
said
Mrs
Flintwinch
in
a
rather
sharp
key
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
girl
,
surely
,
whom
I
saw
near
you
---
almost
hidden
in
the
dark
corner
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
She
?
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
She
's
nothing
;
she
's
a
whim
of
---
hers
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
peculiarity
of
Affery
Flintwinch
that
she
never
spoke
of
Mrs
Clennam
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
another
sort
of
girls
than
that
about
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
forgot
your
old
sweetheart
?
 
<EOS>
Long
and
long
ago
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suffered
enough
from
my
mother
's
separating
us
,
to
remember
her
.
   
<EOS>
I
recollect
her
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
another
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
news
for
you
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
well
to
do
now
,
and
a
widow
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
like
to
have
her
,
why
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
know
that
,
Affery
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Them
two
clever
ones
have
been
speaking
about
it
.
<EOS>
---
There
's
Jeremiah
on
the
stairs
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
gone
in
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Flintwinch
had
introduced
into
the
web
that
his
mind
was
busily
weaving
,
in
that
old
workshop
where
the
loom
of
his
youth
had
stood
,
the
last
thread
wanting
to
the
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
The
airy
folly
of
a
boy
's
love
had
found
its
way
even
into
that
house
,
and
he
had
been
as
wretched
under
its
hopelessness
as
if
the
house
had
been
a
castle
of
romance
.
 
<EOS>
Little
more
than
a
week
ago
at
Marseilles
,
the
face
of
the
pretty
girl
from
whom
he
had
parted
with
regret
,
had
had
an
unusual
interest
for
him
,
and
a
tender
hold
upon
him
,
because
of
some
resemblance
,
real
or
imagined
,
to
this
first
face
that
had
soared
out
of
his
gloomy
life
into
the
bright
glories
of
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
He
leaned
upon
the
sill
of
the
long
low
window
,
and
looking
out
upon
the
blackened
forest
of
chimneys
again
,
began
to
dream
;
for
it
had
been
the
uniform
tendency
of
this
man
's
life
---
so
much
was
wanting
in
it
to
think
about
,
so
much
that
might
have
been
better
directed
and
happier
to
speculate
upon
---
to
make
him
a
dreamer
,
after
all
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
04
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Flintwinch
has
a
Dream
 
<EOS>
When
Mrs
Flintwinch
dreamed
,
she
usually
dreamed
,
unlike
the
son
of
her
old
mistress
,
with
her
eyes
shut
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
curiously
vivid
dream
that
night
,
and
before
she
had
left
the
son
of
her
old
mistress
many
hours
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
it
was
not
at
all
like
a
dream
;
it
was
so
very
real
in
every
respect
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
in
this
wise
.
   
<EOS>
The
bed
-
chamber
occupied
by
Mr
and
Mrs
Flintwinch
was
within
a
few
paces
of
that
to
which
Mrs
Clennam
had
been
so
long
confined
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
on
the
same
floor
,
for
it
was
a
room
at
the
side
of
the
house
,
which
was
approached
by
a
steep
descent
of
a
few
odd
steps
,
diverging
from
the
main
staircase
nearly
opposite
to
Mrs
Clennam
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
scarcely
be
said
to
be
within
call
,
the
walls
,
doors
,
and
panelling
of
the
old
place
were
so
cumbrous
;
but
it
was
within
easy
reach
,
in
any
undress
,
at
any
hour
of
the
night
,
in
any
temperature
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
the
bed
and
within
a
foot
of
Mrs
Flintwinch
's
ear
,
was
a
bell
,
the
line
of
which
hung
ready
to
Mrs
Clennam
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
this
bell
rang
,
up
started
Affery
,
and
was
in
the
sick
room
before
she
was
awake
.
   
<EOS>
Having
got
her
mistress
into
bed
,
lighted
her
lamp
,
and
given
her
good
night
,
Mrs
Flintwinch
went
to
roost
as
usual
,
saving
that
her
lord
had
not
yet
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
her
lord
himself
who
became
---
unlike
the
last
theme
in
the
mind
,
according
to
the
observation
of
most
philosophers
---
the
subject
of
Mrs
Flintwinch
's
dream
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
her
that
she
awoke
after
sleeping
some
hours
,
and
found
Jeremiah
not
yet
abed
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
looked
at
the
candle
she
had
left
burning
,
and
,
measuring
the
time
like
King
Alfred
the
Great
,
was
confirmed
by
its
wasted
state
in
her
belief
that
she
had
been
asleep
for
some
considerable
period
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
arose
thereupon
,
muffled
herself
up
in
a
wrapper
,
put
on
her
shoes
,
and
went
out
on
the
staircase
,
much
surprised
,
to
look
for
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
The
staircase
was
as
wooden
and
solid
as
need
be
,
and
Affery
went
straight
down
it
without
any
of
those
deviations
peculiar
to
dreams
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
skim
over
it
,
but
walked
down
it
,
and
guided
herself
by
the
banisters
on
account
of
her
candle
having
died
out
.
<EOS>
In
one
corner
of
the
hall
,
behind
the
house
-
door
,
there
was
a
little
waiting
-
room
,
like
a
well
-
shaft
,
with
a
long
narrow
window
in
it
as
if
it
had
been
ripped
up
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
room
,
which
was
never
used
,
a
light
was
burning
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Flintwinch
crossed
the
hall
,
feeling
its
pavement
cold
to
her
stockingless
feet
,
and
peeped
in
between
the
rusty
hinges
on
the
door
,
which
stood
a
little
open
.
 
<EOS>
She
expected
to
see
Jeremiah
fast
asleep
or
in
a
fit
,
but
he
was
calmly
seated
in
a
chair
,
awake
,
and
in
his
usual
health
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
---
hey
?
---
<EOS>
Lord
forgive
us
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Mrs
Flintwinch
muttered
some
ejaculation
to
this
effect
,
and
turned
giddy
.
   
<EOS>
For
,
Mr
Flintwinch
awake
,
was
watching
Mr
Flintwinch
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
on
one
side
of
the
small
table
,
looking
keenly
at
himself
on
the
other
side
with
his
chin
sunk
on
his
breast
,
snoring
.
 
<EOS>
The
waking
Flintwinch
had
his
full
front
face
presented
to
his
wife
;
the
sleeping
Flintwinch
was
in
profile
.
 
<EOS>
The
waking
Flintwinch
was
the
old
original
;
the
sleeping
Flintwinch
was
the
double
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
she
might
have
distinguished
between
a
tangible
object
and
its
reflection
in
a
glass
,
Affery
made
out
this
difference
with
her
head
going
round
and
round
.
   
<EOS>
If
she
had
had
any
doubt
which
was
her
own
Jeremiah
,
it
would
have
been
resolved
by
his
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
about
him
for
an
offensive
weapon
,
caught
up
the
snuffers
,
and
,
before
applying
them
to
the
cabbage
-
headed
candle
,
lunged
at
the
sleeper
as
though
he
would
have
run
him
through
the
body
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
sleeper
,
starting
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
made
a
movement
with
the
snuffers
,
as
if
he
would
have
enforced
silence
on
his
companion
by
putting
them
down
his
throat
;
the
companion
,
coming
to
himself
,
said
,
rubbing
his
eyes
,
"
I
forgot
where
I
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
asleep
,
"
snarled
Jeremiah
,
referring
to
his
watch
,
"
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
You
said
you
would
be
rested
enough
if
you
had
a
short
nap
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
a
short
nap
,
"
said
Double
.
   
<EOS>
"
Half
-
past
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
"
muttered
Jeremiah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
your
hat
?
 
<EOS>
Where
's
your
coat
?
 
<EOS>
Where
's
the
box
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
here
,
"
said
Double
,
tying
up
his
throat
with
sleepy
carefulness
in
a
shawl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
Now
give
me
the
sleeve
---
not
that
sleeve
,
the
other
one
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
as
young
as
I
was
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
had
pulled
him
into
his
coat
with
vehement
energy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
promised
me
a
second
glass
after
I
was
rested
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Drink
it
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Jeremiah
,
"
and
---
choke
yourself
,
I
was
going
to
say
---
but
go
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
At
the
same
time
he
produced
the
identical
port
-
wine
bottle
,
and
filled
a
wine
-
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
port
-
wine
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Double
,
tasting
it
as
if
he
were
in
the
Docks
,
with
hours
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
health
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
a
sip
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
health
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
another
sip
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
health
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
another
sip
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
all
friends
round
St
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
emptied
and
put
down
the
wine
-
glass
half
-
way
through
this
ancient
civic
toast
,
and
took
up
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
iron
box
<EOS>
some
two
feet
square
,
which
he
carried
under
his
arms
pretty
easily
.
 
<EOS>
Jeremiah
watched
his
manner
of
adjusting
it
,
with
jealous
eyes
;
tried
it
with
his
hands
,
to
be
sure
that
he
had
a
firm
hold
of
it
;
bade
him
for
his
life
be
careful
what
he
was
about
;
and
then
stole
out
on
tiptoe
to
open
the
door
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Affery
,
anticipating
the
last
movement
,
was
on
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
The
sequence
of
things
was
so
ordinary
and
natural
,
that
,
standing
there
,
she
could
hear
the
door
open
,
feel
the
night
air
,
and
see
the
stars
outside
.
   
<EOS>
But
now
came
the
most
remarkable
part
of
the
dream
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
so
afraid
of
her
husband
,
that
being
on
the
staircase
,
she
had
not
the
power
to
retreat
to
her
room
(
which
she
might
easily
have
done
before
he
had
fastened
the
door
)
,
but
stood
there
staring
.
<EOS>
Consequently
when
he
came
up
the
staircase
to
bed
,
candle
in
hand
,
he
came
full
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
astonished
,
but
said
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
kept
his
eyes
upon
her
,
and
kept
advancing
;
and
she
,
completely
under
his
influence
,
kept
retiring
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
she
walking
backward
and
he
walking
forward
,
they
came
into
their
own
room
.
<EOS>
They
were
no
sooner
shut
in
there
,
than
Mr
Flintwinch
took
her
by
the
throat
,
and
shook
her
until
she
was
black
in
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Affery
,
woman
---
Affery
!
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
been
dreaming
of
?
 
<EOS>
Wake
up
,
wake
up
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
---
the
matter
,
Jeremiah
?
"
gasped
Mrs
Flintwinch
,
rolling
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Affery
,
woman
---
Affery
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
getting
out
of
bed
in
your
sleep
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
come
up
,
after
having
fallen
asleep
myself
,
below
,
and
find
you
in
your
wrapper
here
,
with
the
nightmare
.
<EOS>
Affery
,
woman
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
with
a
friendly
grin
on
his
expressive
countenance
,
"
if
you
ever
have
a
dream
of
this
sort
again
,
it
'll
be
a
sign
of
your
being
in
want
of
physic
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
give
you
such
a
dose
,
old
woman
---
such
a
dose
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Flintwinch
thanked
him
and
crept
into
bed
.
    
<EOS>
Family
Affairs
 
<EOS>
As
the
city
clocks
struck
nine
on
Monday
morning
,
Mrs
Clennam
was
wheeled
by
Jeremiah
Flintwinch
of
the
cut
-
down
aspect
to
her
tall
cabinet
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
unlocked
and
opened
it
,
and
had
settled
herself
at
its
desk
,
Jeremiah
withdrew
---
as
it
might
be
,
to
hang
himself
more
effectually
---
and
her
son
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
any
better
this
morning
,
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
with
the
same
austere
air
of
luxuriousness
that
she
had
shown
over
-
night
when
speaking
of
the
weather
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
better
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
well
for
me
,
Arthur
,
that
I
know
it
and
can
bear
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sitting
with
her
hands
laid
separately
upon
the
desk
,
and
the
tall
cabinet
towering
before
her
,
she
looked
as
if
she
were
performing
on
a
dumb
church
organ
.
 
<EOS>
Her
son
thought
so
(
it
was
an
old
thought
with
him
)
,
while
he
took
his
seat
beside
it
.
   
<EOS>
She
opened
a
drawer
or
two
,
looked
over
some
business
papers
,
and
put
them
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
Her
severe
face
had
no
thread
of
relaxation
in
it
,
by
which
any
explorer
could
have
been
guided
to
the
gloomy
labyrinth
of
her
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
speak
of
our
affairs
,
mother
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
inclined
to
enter
upon
business
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
inclined
,
Arthur
?
 
<EOS>
Rather
,
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Your
father
has
been
dead
a
year
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
at
your
disposal
,
and
waiting
your
pleasure
,
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
much
to
arrange
before
I
could
leave
;
and
when
I
did
leave
,
I
travelled
a
little
for
rest
and
relief
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
turned
her
face
towards
him
,
as
not
having
heard
or
understood
his
last
words
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
rest
and
relief
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
glanced
round
the
sombre
room
,
and
appeared
from
the
motion
of
her
lips
to
repeat
the
words
to
herself
,
as
calling
it
to
witness
how
little
of
either
it
afforded
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
mother
,
you
being
sole
executrix
,
and
having
the
direction
and
management
of
the
estate
,
there
remained
little
business
,
or
I
might
say
none
,
that
I
could
transact
,
until
you
had
had
time
to
arrange
matters
to
your
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
accounts
are
made
out
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
them
here
.
 
<EOS>
The
vouchers
have
all
been
examined
and
passed
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
inspect
them
when
you
like
,
Arthur
;
now
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
enough
,
mother
,
to
know
that
the
business
is
completed
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
proceed
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
her
frozen
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
our
House
has
done
less
and
less
for
some
years
past
,
and
our
dealings
have
been
progressively
on
the
decline
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
never
shown
much
confidence
,
or
invited
much
;
we
have
attached
no
people
to
us
;
the
track
we
have
kept
is
not
the
track
of
the
time
;
and
we
have
been
left
far
behind
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
dwell
on
this
to
you
,
mother
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
necessarily
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
you
mean
,
"
she
answered
,
in
a
qualified
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Even
this
old
house
in
which
we
speak
,
"
pursued
her
son
,
"
is
an
instance
of
what
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
father
's
earlier
time
,
and
in
his
uncle
's
time
before
him
,
it
was
a
place
of
business
---
really
a
place
of
business
,
and
business
resort
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
it
is
a
mere
anomaly
and
incongruity
here
,
out
of
date
and
out
of
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
All
our
consignments
have
long
been
made
to
Rovinghams
'
the
commission
-
merchants
;
and
although
,
as
a
check
upon
them
,
and
in
the
stewardship
of
my
father
's
resources
,
your
judgment
and
watchfulness
have
been
actively
exerted
,
still
those
qualities
would
have
influenced
my
father
's
fortunes
equally
,
if
you
had
lived
in
any
private
dwelling
:
<EOS>
would
they
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
consider
,
"
she
returned
,
without
answering
his
question
,
"
that
a
house
serves
no
purpose
,
Arthur
,
in
sheltering
your
infirm
and
afflicted
---
justly
infirm
and
righteously
afflicted
---
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
speaking
only
of
business
purposes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
what
object
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
coming
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
foresee
,
"
she
returned
,
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
,
"
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
But
the
Lord
forbid
that
I
should
repine
under
any
visitation
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
sinfulness
I
merit
bitter
disappointment
,
and
I
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
I
grieve
to
hear
you
speak
like
this
,
though
I
have
had
my
apprehensions
that
you
would
---
"
   
"
You
knew
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
You
knew
ME
,
"
she
interrupted
.
   
<EOS>
Her
son
paused
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
struck
fire
out
of
her
,
and
was
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
relapsing
into
stone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
anticipated
,
mother
,
that
I
decide
for
my
part
,
to
abandon
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
take
upon
myself
to
advise
you
;
you
will
continue
it
,
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
any
influence
with
you
,
I
would
simply
use
it
to
soften
your
judgment
of
me
in
causing
you
this
disappointment
:
to
represent
to
you
that
I
have
lived
the
half
of
a
long
term
of
life
,
and
have
never
before
set
my
own
will
against
yours
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
been
able
to
conform
myself
,
in
heart
and
spirit
,
to
your
rules
;
I
can
not
say
that
I
believe
my
forty
years
have
been
profitable
or
pleasant
to
myself
,
or
any
one
;
but
I
have
habitually
submitted
,
and
I
only
ask
you
to
remember
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Woe
to
the
suppliant
,
<EOS>
if
such
a
one
there
were
or
ever
had
been
,
who
had
any
concession
to
look
for
in
the
inexorable
face
at
the
cabinet
.
 
<EOS>
Woe
to
the
defaulter
whose
appeal
lay
to
the
tribunal
where
those
severe
eyes
presided
.
 
<EOS>
Great
need
had
the
rigid
woman
of
her
mystical
religion
,
veiled
in
gloom
and
darkness
,
with
lightnings
of
cursing
,
vengeance
,
and
destruction
,
flashing
through
the
sable
clouds
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
forgive
our
debtors
,
was
a
prayer
too
poor
in
spirit
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Smite
Thou
my
debtors
<EOS>
,
Lord
,
wither
them
,
crush
them
;
do
Thou
as
I
would
do
,
and
Thou
shalt
have
my
worship
:
this
was
the
impious
tower
of
stone
she
built
up
to
scale
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
finished
,
Arthur
,
or
have
you
anything
more
to
say
to
me
?
   
<EOS>
I
think
there
can
be
nothing
else

<EOS>
You
have
been
short
,

full
of
matter

"
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
I
have
yet
something
more
to
say

<EOS>
It
has
been
upon
my
mind
,
night
and
day
,
this
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
far
more
difficult
to
say
than
what
I
have
said
.
 
<EOS>
That
concerned
myself
;
this
concerns
us
all

"
   
<EOS>
"
Us
all

<EOS>
Who
are
us
all

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yourself

myself

my
dead
father

<EOS>
She
took
her
hands
from
the
desk
;
folded
them
in
her
lap
;
and
sat
looking
towards
the
fire
,
with
the
impenetrability
of
an
old
Egyptian
sculpture
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
knew
my
father
infinitely
better
than
I
ever
knew
him
;
and
his
reserve
with
me
yielded
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
much
the
stronger
,
mother
,
and
directed
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
child
,
I
knew
it
as
well
as
I
know
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
your
ascendancy
over
him
was
the
cause
of
<EOS>
his
going
to
China
to
take
care
of
the
business
there
,
while
you
took
care
of
it
here
(
though
I
do
not
even
now
know
whether
these
were
really
terms
of
separation
that
you
agreed
upon
)
;
and
that
it
was
your
will
that
I
should
remain
with
you
until
I
was
twenty
,
and
then
go
to
him
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
offended
by
my
recalling
this
,
after
twenty
years
?

<EOS>
"
I
am
waiting
to
hear
why
you
recall
it

<EOS>
He
lowered
his
voice
,
and
said
,
with
manifest
reluctance
,
and
against
his
will
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
ask
you
,
mother
,
whether
it
ever
occurred
to
you
to
suspect
---
"
   
<EOS>
At
the
word
Suspect
,
she
turned
her
eyes
momentarily
upon
her
son
,
with
a
dark
frown
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
suffered
them
to
seek
the
fire
,
as
before
;
but
with
the
frown
fixed
above
them
,
as
if
the
sculptor
of
old
Egypt
had
indented
it
in
the
hard
granite
face
,
to
frown
for
ages
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
that
he
had
any
secret
remembrance
which
caused
him
trouble
of
mind
---
remorse
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
you
ever
observed
anything
in
his
conduct
suggesting
that
;
or
ever
spoke
to
him
upon
it
,
or
ever
heard
him
hint
at
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
what
kind
of
secret
remembrance
you
mean
to
infer
that
your
father
was
a
prey
to
,
"
she
returned
,
after
a
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
speak
so
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
,
mother
,
"
her
son
leaned
forward
to
be
the
nearer
to
her
while
he
whispered
it
,
and
laid
his
hand
nervously
upon
her
desk
,
"
is
it
possible
,
mother
,
that
he
had
unhappily
wronged
any
one
,
and
made
no
reparation
?
"
   
<EOS>
Looking
at
him
<EOS>
wrathfully
,
she
bent
herself
back
in
her
chair
to
keep
him
further
off
,
but
gave
him
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
deeply
sensible
,
mother
,
that
if
this
thought
has
never
at
any
time
flashed
upon
you

it
must
seem
cruel
and
unnatural
in
me

even
in
this
confidence

to
breathe
it

But
I
can
not
shake
it
off

Time
and
change
<EOS>
(
I
have
tried
both
before
breaking
silence

do
nothing

wear
it
out

<EOS>
Remember
,
I
was
with
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
I
saw
his
face
when
he
gave
the
watch
into
my
keeping
,
and
struggled
to
express
that
he
sent
it
as
a
token
you
would
understand
,
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
<EOS>
,
I
saw
him
at
the
last
with
the
pencil
in
his
failing
hand
,
trying
to
write
some
word
for
you
to
read
,
but
to
which
he
could
give
no
shape
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
remote
and
cruel
this
vague
suspicion

I
have

stronger
the
circumstances
that
could
give
it
any
semblance
of
probability
to
me

<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
let
us
examine
sacredly
whether
there
is
any
wrong
entrusted
to
us
to
set
right
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
can
help
towards
it

you

Still
so
recoiling
in
her
chair
that
her
overpoised
weight
moved
it
,
from
time
to
time
,
a
little
on
its
wheels
,
and
gave
her
the
appearance
of
a
phantom
of
fierce
aspect
gliding
away
from
him
,
she
interposed
her
left
arm
,
bent
at
the
elbow
with
the
back
of
her
hand
towards
her
face
,
between
herself
and
him
,
and
looked
at
him
in
a
fixed
silence
.

"
<EOS>
In
grasping
at
money
and
in
driving
hard
bargains

I
have
begun
,
and
I
must
speak
of
such
things
now
,
mother
---
some
one
may
have
been
grievously
deceived
,
injured
,
ruined
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
the
moving
power
of
all
this
machinery
before
my
birth
;
your
stronger
spirit
has
been
infused
into
all
my
father
's
dealings
for
more
than
two
score
years
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
set
these
doubts
at
rest
,
I
think
,
if
you
will
really
help
me
to
discover
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
,
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
in
the
hope
that
she
would
speak
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
grey
hair
was
not
more
immovable
in
its
two
folds
,
than
were
her
firm
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
reparation
can
be
made
to
any
one
,
if
restitution
can
be
made
to
any
one
,
let
us
know
it
and
make
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
mother
,
if
within
my
means
,
let
ME
make
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
so
little
happiness
come
of
money
;
it
has
brought
within
my
knowledge
so
little
peace
to
this
house
,
or
to
any
one
belonging
to
it
,
that
it
is
worth
less
to
me
than
to
another
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
buy
me
nothing
that
will
not
be
a
reproach
and
misery
to
me
,
if
I
am
haunted
by
a
suspicion
that
it
darkened
my
father
's
last
hours
with
remorse
,
and
that
it
is
not
honestly
and
justly
mine

<EOS>
"
There
was
a
bell
-
rope
hanging
on
the
panelled
wall
,
some
two
or
three
yards
from
the
cabinet
.
 
<EOS>
By
a
swift
and
sudden
action
of
her
foot
,
she
drove
her
wheeled
chair
rapidly
back
to
it
and
pulled
it
violently
---
still
holding
her
arm
up
in
its
shield
-
like
posture
,
as
if
he
were
striking
at
her
,
and
she
warding
off
the
blow
.
   
<EOS>
A
girl
came
hurrying
in
,
frightened
.
   
<EOS>
"
Send
Flintwinch
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
a
moment
the
girl
had
withdrawn
,
and
the
old
man
stood
within
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
hammer
and
tongs
,
already
,
you
two
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
coolly
stroking
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
pretty
sure
of
it
.

<EOS>
"
Flintwinch

said
the
mother
,
"

Look
at
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
AM
looking
at
him
,
"
said
Flintwinch
.
   
<EOS>
She
stretched
out
the
arm
with
which
she
had
shielded
herself
,
and
as
she
went
on
,
pointed
at
the
object
of
her
anger
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
very
hour
of
his
return
almost
---
before
the
shoe
upon
his
foot
is
dry
---
he
asperses
his
father
's
memory
to
his
mother
!
 
<EOS>
Asks
his
mother
to
become
,
with
him
,
a
spy
upon
his
father
's
transactions
through
a
lifetime
!
 
<EOS>
Has
misgivings
that
the
goods
of
this
world
which
we
have
painfully
got
together
early
and
late
,
with
wear
and
tear
and
toil
and
self
-
denial
,
are
so
much
plunder
;
and
asks
to
whom
they
shall
be
given
up
,
as
reparation
and
restitution
!
"
   
<EOS>
Although
she
said
this
raging
,
she
said
it
in
a
voice
so
far
from
being
beyond
her
control
that
it
was
even
lower
than
her
usual
tone
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
spoke
with
great
distinctness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Reparation
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
truly
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
easy
for
him
to
talk
of
reparation
,
fresh
from
journeying
and
junketing
in
foreign
lands
,
and
living
a
life
of
vanity
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
him
look
at
me
,
in
prison
,
and
in
bonds
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
endure
without
murmuring
,
because
it
is
appointed
that
I
shall
so
make
reparation
for
my
sins
.
 
<EOS>
Reparation
!
 
<EOS>
Is
there
none
in
this
room
?
 
<EOS>
Has
there
been
none
here
this
fifteen
years
?
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
was
she
always
balancing
her
bargains
with
the
Majesty
of
heaven
,
posting
up
the
entries
to
her
credit
,
strictly
keeping
her
set
-
off
,
and
claiming
her
due
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
only
remarkable
in
this
,
for
the
force
and
emphasis
with
which
she
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thousands
upon
thousands
do
it
,
according
to
their
varying
manner
,
every
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Flintwinch
,
give
me
that
book
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
handed
it
to
her
from
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
two
fingers
between
the
leaves
,
closed
the
book
upon
them
,
and
held
it
up
to
her
son
in
a
threatening
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
In
the
days
of
old
,
Arthur
,
treated
of
in
this
commentary
,
there
were
pious
men
,
beloved
of
the
Lord
,
who
would
have
cursed
their
sons
for
less
than
this
:
who
would
have
sent
them
forth
,
and
sent
whole
nations
forth
,
if
such
had
supported
them
,
to
be
avoided
of
God
and
man
,
and
perish
,
down
to
the
baby
at
the
breast
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
only
tell
you
that
if
you
ever
renew
that
theme
with
me
,
I
will
renounce
you
;
I
will
so
dismiss
you
through
that
doorway
,
that
you
had
better
have
been
motherless
from
your
cradle
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
never
see
or
know
you
more
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
,
after
all
,
you
were
to
come
into
this
darkened
room
to
look
upon
me
lying
dead
,
my
body
should
bleed
,
if
I
could
make
it
,
when
you
came
near
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
part
relieved
by
the
intensity
of
this
threat
,
and
in
part
(
monstrous
as
the
fact
is
)
by
a
general
impression
that
it
was
in
some
sort
a
religious
proceeding
,
she
handed
back
the
book
to
the
old
man
,
and
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Jeremiah
;
"
premising
that
I
'm
not
going
to
stand
between
you
two
,
will
you
let
me
ask
(
as
I
have
been
called
in
,
and
made
a
third
)
<EOS>
what
is
all
this
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Take
your
version
of
it
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
finding
it
left
to
him
to
speak
,
"
from
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
rest
there
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
said
,
was
said
to
my
mother
only
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
returned
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
your
mother
?
 
<EOS>
Take
it
from
your
mother
?
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
But
your
mother
mentioned
that
you
had
been
suspecting
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
not
dutiful
,
Mr
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
Who
will
you
be
suspecting
next
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
turning
her
face
so
that
it
was
addressed
for
the
moment
to
the
old
man
only
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
no
more
be
said
about
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
stop
a
bit
,
stop
a
bit
,
"
the
old
man
persisted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
see
how
we
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
told
Mr
Arthur
that
he
must
n't
lay
offences
at
his
father
's
door
?
 
<EOS>
That
he
has
no
right
to
do
it
?
<EOS>
That
he
has
no
ground
to
go
upon
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
so
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Exactly
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
tell
him
so
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
n't
told
him
so
before
,
and
you
tell
him
so
now
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
!
<EOS>
That
's
right
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
stood
between
you
and
his
father
so
long
,
that
it
seems
as
if
death
had
made
no
difference
,
and
I
was
still
standing
between
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
will
,
and
<EOS>
so
in
fairness
I
require
to
have
that
plainly
put
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
,
you
please
to
hear
that
you
have
no
right
to
mistrust
your
father
,
and
have
no
ground
to
go
upon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hands
to
the
back
of
the
wheeled
chair
,
and
muttering
to
himself
,
slowly
wheeled
his
mistress
back
to
her
cabinet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
he
resumed
,
standing
behind
her
:
"
in
case
I
should
go
away
leaving
things
half
done
,
and
so
should
be
wanted
again
<EOS>
when
you
come
to
the
other
half
and
get
into
one
of
your
flights
,
has
Arthur
told
you
what
he
means
to
do
about
the
business
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
relinquished
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
favour
of
nobody
,
I
suppose
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
glanced
at
her
son
,
leaning
against
one
of
the
windows
.
   
<EOS>
He
observed
the
look
and
said
,
"
To
my
mother
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
She
does
what
she
pleases
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
any
pleasure
,
"
she
said
after
a
short
pause
,
"
could
arise
for
me
out
of
the
disappointment
of
my
expectations
that
my
son
,
in
the
prime
of
his
life
,
would
infuse
new
youth
and
strength
into
it
,
and
make
it
of
great
profit
and
power
,
it
would
be
in
advancing
an
old
and
faithful
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Jeremiah
,
the
captain
deserts
the
ship
,
but
you
and
I
will
sink
or
float
with
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jeremiah
,
whose
eyes
glistened
as
if
they
saw
money
,
darted
a
sudden
look
at
the
son
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
I
owe
YOU
no
thanks
for
this
;
YOU
have
done
nothing
towards
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
told
the
mother
that
he
thanked
her
,
and
that
Affery
thanked
her
,
and
that
he
would
never
desert
her
,
and
that
Affery
would
never
desert
her
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
he
hauled
up
his
watch
from
its
depths
,
and
said
,
"
Eleven
.
<EOS>
Time
for
your
oysters
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
that
change
of
subject
,
which
involved
no
change
of
expression
or
manner
,
rang
the
bell
.
   
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Clennam
,
resolved
to
treat
herself
with
the
greater
rigour
for
having
been
supposed
to
be
unacquainted
with
reparation
,
refused
to
eat
her
oysters
when
they
were
brought
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
tempting
;
eight
in
number
,
circularly
set
out
on
a
white
plate
on
a
tray
covered
with
a
white
napkin
,
flanked
by
a
slice
of
buttered
French
roll
,
and
a
little
compact
glass
of
cool
wine
and
water
;
but
she
resisted
all
persuasions
,
and
sent
them
down
again
---
placing
the
act
to
her
credit
,
no
doubt
,
in
her
Eternal
Day
-
Book
.
   
<EOS>
This
refection
of
oysters
was
not
presided
over
by
Affery
,
but
by
the
girl
who
had
appeared
when
the
bell
was
rung
;
the
same
who
had
been
in
the
dimly
-
lighted
room
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
he
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
her
,
Arthur
found
that
her
diminutive
figure
,
small
features
,
and
slight
spare
dress
,
gave
her
the
appearance
of
being
much
younger
than
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
A
woman
,
probably
of
not
less
than
two
-
and
-
twenty
,
she
might
have
been
passed
in
the
street
for
little
more
than
half
that
age
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
her
face
was
very
youthful
,
for
in
truth
there
was
more
consideration
and
care
in
it
than
naturally
belonged
to
her
utmost
years
;
but
she
was
so
little
and
light
,
so
noiseless
and
shy
,
and
appeared
so
conscious
of
being
out
of
place
among
the
three
hard
elders
,
that
she
had
all
the
manner
and
much
of
the
appearance
of
a
subdued
child
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
hard
way
,
and
in
an
uncertain
way
that
fluctuated
between
patronage
and
putting
down
,
the
sprinkling
from
a
watering
-
pot
and
hydraulic
pressure
,
Mrs
Clennam
showed
an
interest
in
this
dependent
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
the
moment
of
her
entrance
,
upon
the
violent
ringing
of
the
bell
,
when
the
mother
shielded
herself
with
that
singular
action
from
the
son
,
Mrs
Clennam
's
eyes
had
had
some
individual
recognition
in
them
,
which
seemed
reserved
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
there
are
degrees
of
hardness
in
the
hardest
metal
,
and
shades
of
colour
in
black
itself
,
so
,
even
in
the
asperity
of
Mrs
Clennam
's
demeanour
towards
all
the
rest
of
humanity
and
towards
Little
Dorrit
,
there
was
a
fine
gradation
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
let
herself
out
to
do
needlework
.
 
<EOS>
At
so
much
a
day
---
or
at
so
little
---
from
eight
to
eight
,
Little
Dorrit
was
to
be
hired
.
 
<EOS>
Punctual
to
the
moment
,
Little
Dorrit
appeared
;
punctual
to
the
moment
,
Little
Dorrit
vanished
.
 
<EOS>
What
became
of
Little
Dorrit
between
the
two
eights
was
a
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
Another
of
the
moral
phenomena
of
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
her
consideration
money
,
her
daily
contract
included
meals
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
an
extraordinary
repugnance
to
dining
in
company
;
would
never
do
so
,
if
it
were
possible
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
Would
always
plead
that
she
had
this
bit
of
work
to
begin
first
,
or
that
bit
of
work
to
finish
first
;
and
would
,
of
a
certainty
,
scheme
and
plan
---
not
very
cunningly
,
it
would
seem
,
for
she
deceived
no
one
---
to
dine
alone
.
<EOS>
Successful
in
this
,
happy
in
carrying
off
her
plate
anywhere
,
to
make
a
table
of
her
lap
,
or
a
box
,
or
the
ground
,
or
even
as
was
supposed
,
to
stand
on
tip
-
toe
,
dining
moderately
at
a
mantel
-
shelf
;
the
great
anxiety
of
Little
Dorrit
's
day
was
set
at
rest
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
easy
to
make
out
Little
Dorrit
's
face
;
she
was
so
retiring
,
plied
her
needle
in
such
removed
corners
,
and
started
away
so
scared
if
encountered
on
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
seemed
to
be
a
pale
transparent
face
,
quick
in
expression
,
though
not
beautiful
in
feature
<EOS>
,
its
soft
hazel
eyes
excepted
.
 
<EOS>
A
delicately
bent
head
,
a
tiny
form
,
a
quick
little
pair
of
busy
hands
,
and
a
shabby
dress
---
<EOS>
it
must
needs
<EOS>
have
been
very
shabby
to
look
at
all
so
,
being
so
neat
---
were
Little
Dorrit
as
she
sat
at
work
.
   
<EOS>
For
these
particulars
or
generalities
concerning
Little
Dorrit
,
Mr
Arthur
was
indebted
in
the
course
of
the
day
to
his
own
eyes
and
to
Mrs
Affery
's
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mrs
Affery
had
had
any
will
or
way
of
her
own
,
it
would
probably
have
been
unfavourable
to
Little
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
But
as
"
them
two
clever
ones
"
---
Mrs
Affery
's
perpetual
reference
,
in
whom
her
personality
was
swallowed
up
---
were
agreed
to
accept
Little
Dorrit
as
a
matter
of
course
,
she
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
follow
suit
.
 
<EOS>
Similarly
,
if
the
two
clever
ones
had
agreed
to
murder
Little
Dorrit
by
candlelight
,
Mrs
Affery
,
being
required
to
hold
the
candle
,
would
no
doubt
have
done
it
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
intervals
of
roasting
the
partridge
for
the
invalid
chamber
,
and
preparing
a
baking
-
dish
of
beef
and
pudding
for
the
dining
-
room
,
Mrs
Affery
made
the
communications
above
set
forth
;
invariably
putting
her
head
in
at
the
door
again
after
she
had
taken
it
out
,
to
enforce
resistance
to
the
two
clever
ones
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
have
become
a
perfect
passion
with
Mrs
Flintwinch
,
that
the
only
son
should
be
pitted
against
them
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
day
,
too
,
Arthur
looked
through
the
whole
house
.
 
<EOS>
Dull
and
dark
<EOS>
he
found
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
gaunt
rooms
,
deserted
for
years
upon
years
,
seemed
to
have
settled
down
into
a
gloomy
lethargy
from
which
nothing
could
rouse
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
furniture
,
at
once
spare
and
lumbering
,
hid
in
the
rooms
rather
than
furnished
them
,
and
there
was
no
colour
in
all
the
house
;
such
colour
as
had
ever
been
there
,
had
long
ago
started
away
on
lost
sunbeams
---
got
itself
absorbed
,
perhaps
,
into
flowers
,
butterflies
,
plumage
of
birds
,
precious
stones
,
<EOS>
what
not
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
one
straight
floor
from
the
foundation
to
the
roof
;
the
ceilings
were
so
fantastically
clouded
by
smoke
and
dust
,
that
old
women
might
have
told
fortunes
in
them
better
than
in
grouts
of
tea
;
the
dead
-
cold
hearths
showed
no
traces
of
having
ever
been
warmed
but
in
heaps
of
soot
that
had
tumbled
down
the
chimneys
,
and
eddied
about
in
little
dusky
whirlwinds
when
the
doors
were
opened
.
 
<EOS>
In
what
had
once
been
a
drawing
-
room
,
there
were
a
pair
of
meagre
mirrors
,
with
dismal
processions
of
black
figures
carrying
black
garlands
,
walking
round
the
frames
;
but
even
these
were
short
of
heads
and
legs
,
and
one
undertaker
-
like
Cupid
had
swung
round
on
its
own
axis
and
got
upside
down
,
and
another
had
fallen
off
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
Arthur
Clennam
's
deceased
father
had
occupied
for
business
purposes
,
when
he
first
remembered
him
,
was
so
unaltered
that
he
might
have
been
imagined
still
to
keep
it
invisibly
,
as
his
visible
relict
kept
her
room
up
-
stairs
;
Jeremiah
Flintwinch
still
going
between
them
negotiating
.
 
<EOS>
His
picture
,
dark
and
gloomy
,
earnestly
speechless
on
the
wall
,
with
the
eyes
intently
looking
at
his
son
as
they
had
looked
when
life
departed
from
them
,
seemed
to
urge
him
awfully
to
the
task
he
had
attempted
;
but
as
to
any
yielding
on
the
part
of
his
mother
,
he
had
now
no
hope
,
and
as
to
any
other
means
of
setting
his
distrust
at
rest
,
he
had
abandoned
hope
a
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
Down
in
the
cellars
,
as
up
in
the
bed
-
chambers
,
old
objects
that
he
well
remembered
were
changed
by
age
and
decay
,
but
were
still
in
their
old
places
;
even
to
empty
beer
-
casks
hoary
with
cobwebs
,
and
empty
wine
-
bottles
with
fur
and
fungus
choking
up
their
throats
.
<EOS>
There
,
too
,
among
unusual
bottle
-
racks
and
pale
slants
of
light
from
the
yard
above
,
was
the
strong
room
stored
with
old
ledgers
,
which
had
as
musty
and
corrupt
a
smell
as
if
they
were
regularly
balanced
,
in
the
dead
small
hours
,
by
a
nightly
resurrection
of
old
book
-
keepers
.
   
<EOS>
The
baking
-
dish
was
served
up
in
a
penitential
manner
on
a
shrunken
cloth
at
an
end
of
the
dining
-
table
,
at
two
o'clock
,
when
he
dined
with
Mr
Flintwinch
,
the
new
partner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
informed
him
that
his
mother
had
recovered
her
equanimity
now
,
and
that
he
need
not
fear
her
again
alluding
to
what
had
passed
in
the
morning
.
"
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
lay
offences
at
your
father
's
door
,
Mr
Arthur
,
"
added
Jeremiah
,
"
once
for
all
,
do
n't
do
it
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
we
have
done
with
the
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
had
been
already
rearranging
and
dusting
his
own
particular
little
office
,
as
if
to
do
honour
to
his
accession
to
new
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
He
resumed
this
occupation
when
he
was
replete
with
beef
,
had
sucked
up
all
the
gravy
in
the
baking
-
dish
with
the
flat
of
his
knife
,
and
had
drawn
liberally
on
a
barrel
of
small
beer
in
the
scullery
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
refreshed
,
he
tucked
up
his
shirt
-
sleeves
and
went
to
work
again
;
and
Mr
Arthur
,
watching
him
as
he
set
about
it
,
plainly
saw
that
his
father
's
picture
,
or
his
father
's
grave
,
would
be
as
communicative
with
him
as
this
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Affery
,
woman
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
as
she
crossed
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
n't
made
Mr
Arthur
's
bed
when
I
was
up
there
last
.
 
<EOS>
Stir
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Bustle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
But
Mr
Arthur
found
the
house
so
blank
and
dreary
,
and
was
so
unwilling
to
assist
at
another
implacable
consignment
of
his
mother
's
enemies
(
perhaps
himself
among
them
)
to
mortal
disfigurement
and
immortal
ruin
,
that
he
announced
his
intention
of
lodging
at
the
coffee
-
house
where
he
had
left
his
luggage
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
taking
kindly
to
the
idea
of
getting
rid
of
him
,
and
his
mother
being
indifferent
,
beyond
considerations
of
saving
,
to
most
domestic
arrangements
that
were
not
bounded
by
the
walls
of
her
own
chamber
,
he
easily
carried
this
point
without
new
offence
.
 
<EOS>
Daily
business
hours
were
agreed
upon
,
which
his
mother
,
Mr
Flintwinch
,
and
he
,
were
to
devote
together
to
a
necessary
checking
of
books
and
papers
;
and
he
left
the
home
he
had
so
lately
found
,
with
depressed
heart
.
   
<EOS>
But
Little
Dorrit
?
   
<EOS>
The
business
hours
,
allowing
for
intervals
of
invalid
regimen
of
oysters
and
partridges
,
during
which
Clennam
refreshed
himself
with
a
walk
,
were
from
ten
to
six
for
about
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
Little
Dorrit
was
employed
at
her
needle
,
sometimes
not
,
sometimes
appeared
as
a
humble
visitor
:
which
must
have
been
her
character
on
the
occasion
of
his
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
His
original
curiosity
augmented
every
day
,
as
he
watched
for
her
,
saw
or
did
not
see
her
,
and
speculated
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
Influenced
by
his
predominant
idea
,
he
even
fell
into
a
habit
of
discussing
with
himself
the
possibility
of
her
being
in
some
way
associated
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
resolved
to
watch
Little
Dorrit
and
know
more
of
her
story
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
06
.
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
 
<EOS>
Thirty
years
ago
there
stood
,
a
few
doors
short
of
the
church
of
Saint
George
,
in
the
borough
of
Southwark
,
on
the
left
-
hand
side
of
the
way
going
southward
,
the
Marshalsea
Prison
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
stood
there
many
years
before
,
and
it
remained
there
some
years
afterwards
;
but
it
is
gone
now
,
and
the
world
is
none
the
worse
without
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
an
oblong
pile
of
barrack
building
,
partitioned
into
squalid
houses
standing
back
to
back
,
so
that
there
were
no
back
rooms
;
environed
by
a
narrow
paved
yard
,
hemmed
in
by
high
walls
duly
spiked
at
top
.
 
<EOS>
Itself
a
close
and
confined
prison
for
debtors
,
it
contained
within
it
a
much
closer
and
more
confined
jail
for
smugglers
.
 
<EOS>
Offenders
against
the
revenue
laws
,
and
defaulters
to
excise
or
customs
who
had
incurred
fines
which
they
were
unable
to
pay
,
were
supposed
to
be
incarcerated
behind
an
iron
-
plated
door
closing
up
a
second
prison
,
consisting
of
a
strong
cell
or
two
,
and
a
blind
alley
some
yard
and
a
half
wide
,
which
formed
the
mysterious
termination
of
the
very
limited
skittle
-
ground
in
which
the
Marshalsea
debtors
bowled
down
their
troubles
.
   
<EOS>
Supposed
to
be
incarcerated
there
,
because
the
time
had
rather
outgrown
the
strong
cells
and
the
blind
alley
.
 
<EOS>
In
practice
they
had
come
to
be
considered
a
little
too
bad
,
though
in
theory
they
were
quite
as
good
as
ever
;
which
may
be
observed
to
be
the
case
at
the
present
day
with
other
cells
that
are
not
at
all
strong
,
and
with
other
blind
alleys
that
are
stone
-
blind
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
the
smugglers
habitually
consorted
with
the
debtors
(
who
received
them
with
open
arms
)
,
except
at
certain
constitutional
moments
when
somebody
came
from
some
Office
,
to
go
through
some
form
of
overlooking
something
which
neither
he
nor
anybody
else
knew
anything
about
.
 
<EOS>
On
these
truly
British
occasions
,
the
smugglers
,
if
any
,
made
a
feint
of
walking
into
the
strong
cells
and
the
blind
alley
,
while
this
somebody
pretended
to
do
his
something
:
and
made
a
reality
of
walking
out
again
as
soon
as
he
had
n't
done
it
---
neatly
epitomising
the
administration
of
most
of
the
public
affairs
in
our
right
little
,
tight
little
,
island
.
   
<EOS>
There
had
been
taken
to
the
Marshalsea
Prison
,
long
before
the
day
when
the
sun
shone
on
Marseilles
and
on
the
opening
of
this
narrative
,
a
debtor
with
whom
this
narrative
has
some
concern
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
,
at
that
time
,
a
very
amiable
and
very
helpless
middle
-
aged
gentleman
,
who
was
going
out
again
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Necessarily
,
he
was
going
out
again
directly
,
because
the
Marshalsea
lock
never
turned
upon
a
debtor
who
was
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
brought
in
a
portmanteau
with
him
,
which
he
doubted
its
being
worth
while
to
unpack
;
he
was
so
perfectly
clear
---
like
all
the
rest
of
them
,
the
turnkey
on
the
lock
said
---
that
he
was
going
out
again
directly
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
shy
,
retiring
man
;
well
-
looking
,
though
in
an
effeminate
style
;
with
a
mild
voice
,
curling
hair
,
and
irresolute
hands
---
rings
upon
the
fingers
in
those
days
---
which
nervously
wandered
to
his
trembling
lip
a
hundred
times
in
the
first
half
-
hour
of
his
acquaintance
with
the
jail
.
 
<EOS>
His
principal
anxiety
was
about
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
sir
,
"
he
asked
the
turnkey
,
"
that
she
will
be
very
much
shocked
,
if
she
should
come
to
the
gate
to
-
morrow
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
gave
it
as
the
result
of
his
experience
that
some
of
'em
was
and
some
of
'em
was
n't
.
 
<EOS>
In
general
,
more
no
than
yes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
like
is
she
<EOS>
,
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
philosophically
asked
:
"
that
's
what
it
hinges
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
delicate
and
inexperienced
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
the
turnkey
,
"
is
agen
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
so
little
used
to
go
out
alone
,
"
said
the
debtor
,
"
that
I
am
at
a
loss
to
think
how
she
will
ever
make
her
way
here
,
if
she
walks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
P'raps
,
"
quoth
the
turnkey
,
"
she
'll
take
a
ackney
coach
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
irresolute
fingers
went
to
the
trembling
lip
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
not
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Or
p'raps
,
"
said
the
turnkey
,
offering
his
suggestions
from
the
the
top
of
his
well
-
worn
wooden
stool
,
as
he
might
have
offered
them
to
a
child
for
whose
weakness
he
felt
a
compassion
,
"
p'raps
she
'll
get
her
brother
,
or
her
sister
,
to
come
along
with
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
no

<EOS>
---
Dash

<EOS>
One
or
another
on

"
said
the
turnkey
,
repudiating
beforehand
the
refusal
of
all
his
suggestions
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
---
<EOS>
I
hope
it
is
not
against
the
rules
---
that
she
will
bring
the
children

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
children

"
said
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
rules
?
 
<EOS>
Why

<EOS>
How
many
a
you
got
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Two
,
"
said
the
debtor
,
lifting
his
irresolute
hand
to
his
lip
again
,
and
turning
into
the
prison
.
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
followed
him
with
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
another
<EOS>
,
"
he
observed
to
himself
,
"
which
makes
three
on
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
your
wife
another
,
I
'll
lay
a
crown
.
 
<EOS>
Which
makes
four
on
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
another
coming
,
I
'll
lay
half
-
a
-
crown
.
 
<EOS>
Which'll
make
five
on
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
go
another
seven
and
sixpence
to
name
which
is
the
helplessest
,
the
unborn
baby
or
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
right
in
all
his
particulars
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
next
day
with
a
little
boy
of
three
years
old
,
and
a
little
girl
of
two
,
and
he
stood
entirely
corroborated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Got
a
room
now
;
have
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
the
turnkey
asked
the
debtor
after
a
week
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
got
a
very
good
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Any
little
sticks
a
coming
to
furnish
it
?
"
said
the
turnkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
expect
a
few
necessary
articles
of
furniture
to
be
delivered
by
the
carrier
,
this
afternoon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Missis
and
little
<EOS>
"
uns
a
coming
to
keep
you
company
?
"
asked
the
turnkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
we
think
it
better
that
we
should
not
be
scattered
,
even
for
a
few
weeks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Even
for
a
few
weeks
,
OF
course
,
"
replied
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
followed
him
again
with
his
eyes
,
and
nodded
his
head
seven
times
when
he
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
The
affairs
of
this
debtor
were
perplexed
by
a
partnership
,
of
which
he
knew
no
more
than
that
he
had
invested
money
in
it
;
by
legal
matters
of
assignment
and
settlement
,
conveyance
here
and
conveyance
there
,
suspicion
of
unlawful
preference
of
creditors
in
this
direction
,
and
of
mysterious
spiriting
away
of
property
in
that
;
and
as
nobody
on
the
face
of
the
earth
could
be
more
incapable
of
explaining
any
single
item
in
the
heap
of
confusion
than
the
debtor
himself
,
nothing
comprehensible
could
be
made
of
his
case
.
 
<EOS>
To
question
him
in
detail
,
and
endeavour
to
reconcile
his
answers
;
to
closet
him
with
accountants
and
sharp
practitioners
,
learned
in
the
wiles
of
insolvency
and
bankruptcy
;
was
only
to
put
the
case
out
at
compound
interest
and
incomprehensibility
.
 
<EOS>
The
irresolute
fingers
fluttered
more
and
more
ineffectually
about
the
trembling
lip
on
every
such
occasion
,
and
the
sharpest
practitioners
gave
him
up
as
a
hopeless
job
.
   
<EOS>
"
Out
?
"
said
the
turnkey
,
"
he
'll
never
get
out
,
unless
his
creditors
take
him
by
the
shoulders
and
shove
him
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
there
five
or
six
months
,
when
he
came
running
to
this
turnkey
one
forenoon
to
tell
him
,
breathless
and
pale
,
that
his
wife
was
ill
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
anybody
might
a
known
she
would
be
,
"
said
the
turnkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
intended
,
"
he
returned
,
"
that
she
should
go
to
a
country
lodging
only
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
good
heaven
,
what
am
I
to
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
waste
your
time
in
clasping
your
hands
and
biting
your
fingers
,
"
responded
the
practical
turnkey
,
taking
him
by
the
elbow
,
"
but
come
along
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
conducted
him
---
trembling
from
head
to
foot
,
and
constantly
crying
under
his
breath
,
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
while
his
irresolute
fingers
bedabbled
the
tears
upon
his
face
---
up
one
of
the
common
staircases
in
the
prison
to
a
door
on
the
garret
story
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
door
the
turnkey
knocked
with
the
handle
of
his
key
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
voice
inside
.
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
,
opening
the
door
,
disclosed
in
a
wretched
,
ill
-
smelling
little
room
,
two
hoarse
,
puffy
,
red
-
faced
personages
seated
at
a
rickety
table
,
playing
at
all
-
fours
,
smoking
pipes
,
and
drinking
brandy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
,
"
said
the
turnkey
,
"
here
's
a
gentleman
's
wife
in
want
of
you
without
a
minute
's
loss
of
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
friend
was
in
the
positive
degree
of
hoarseness
,
puffiness
,
red
-
facedness
,
all
-
fours
,
tobacco
,
dirt
,
and
brandy
;
the
doctor
in
the
comparative
---
hoarser
,
puffier
,
more
red
-
faced
,
more
all
-
fourey
,
tobaccoer
,
dirtier
,
and
brandier
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
amazingly
shabby
,
in
a
torn
and
darned
rough
-
weather
sea
-
jacket
,
out
at
elbows
and
eminently
short
of
buttons
<EOS>
(
he
had
been
in
his
time
<EOS>
the
experienced
surgeon
carried
by
a
passenger
ship
)
,
the
dirtiest
white
trousers
conceivable
by
mortal
man
,
carpet
slippers
,
and
no
visible
linen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Childbed
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
the
boy
!
"
<EOS>
With
that
the
doctor
took
a
comb
from
the
chimney
-
piece
and
stuck
his
hair
upright
---
which
appeared
to
be
his
way
of
washing
himself
---
produced
a
professional
chest
or
case
,
of
most
abject
appearance
,
from
the
cupboard
where
his
cup
and
saucer
and
coals
were
,
settled
his
chin
in
the
frowsy
wrapper
round
his
neck
,
and
became
a
ghastly
medical
scarecrow
.
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
and
the
debtor
ran
down
-
stairs
,
leaving
the
turnkey
to
return
to
the
lock
,
and
made
for
the
debtor
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
ladies
in
the
prison
had
got
hold
of
the
news
,
and
were
in
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
had
already
taken
possession
of
the
two
children
,
and
were
hospitably
carrying
them
off
;
others
were
offering
loans
of
little
comforts
from
their
own
scanty
store
;
others
were
sympathising
with
the
greatest
volubility
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
prisoners
,
feeling
themselves
at
a
disadvantage
,
had
for
the
most
part
retired
,
not
to
say
sneaked
,
to
their
rooms
;
from
the
open
windows
of
which
some
of
them
now
complimented
the
doctor
with
whistles
as
he
passed
below
,
while
others
,
with
several
stories
between
them
,
interchanged
sarcastic
references
to
the
prevalent
excitement
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
hot
summer
day
,
and
the
prison
rooms
were
baking
between
the
high
walls
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
debtor
's
confined
chamber
,
Mrs
Bangham
,
charwoman
and
messenger
,
who
was
not
a
prisoner
(
though
she
had
been
once
)
,
but
was
the
popular
medium
of
communication
with
the
outer
world
,
had
volunteered
her
services
as
fly
-
catcher
and
general
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
The
walls
and
ceiling
were
blackened
with
flies
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bangham
,
expert
in
sudden
device
,
with
one
hand
fanned
the
patient
with
a
cabbage
leaf
,
and
with
the
other
set
traps
of
vinegar
and
sugar
in
gallipots
;
at
the
same
time
enunciating
sentiments
of
an
encouraging
and
congratulatory
nature
,
adapted
to
the
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
flies
trouble
you
,
do
n't
they
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Mrs
Bangham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
p'raps
they
'll
take
your
mind
off
of
it
,
and
do
you
good
.
<EOS>
What
between
the
buryin
ground
,
the
grocer
's
,
the
waggon
-
stables
,
and
the
paunch
trade
,
the
Marshalsea
flies
gets
very
large
.
 
<EOS>
P'raps
they
're
sent
as
a
consolation
,
if
we
only
know'd
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
you
now
,
my
dear
?
 
<EOS>
No
better
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
,
it
ai
n't
to
be
expected
;
you
'll
be
worse
before
you
're
better
,
and
you
know
it
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
right
!
 
<EOS>
And
to
think
of
a
sweet
little
cherub
being
born
inside
the
lock
!
 
<EOS>
Now
ai
n't
it
pretty
,
ai
n't
THAT
something
to
carry
you
through
it
pleasant
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
we
ai
n't
had
such
a
thing
happen
here
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
not
for
I
could
n't
name
the
time
when
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
a
crying
too
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Bangham
,
to
rally
the
patient
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
!
 
<EOS>
Making
yourself
so
famous
!
 
<EOS>
With
the
flies
a
falling
into
the
gallipots
by
fifties
!
 
<EOS>
And
everything
a
going
on
so
well
!
<EOS>
And
here
if
there
ai
n't
,
"
said
Mrs
Bangham
as
the
door
opened
,
"
if
there
ai
n't
your
dear
gentleman
along
with
Dr
Haggage
!
 
<EOS>
And
now
indeed
we
ARE
complete
,
I
THINK
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
scarcely
the
kind
of
apparition
to
inspire
a
patient
with
a
sense
of
absolute
completeness
,
but
as
he
presently
delivered
the
opinion
,
"
We
are
as
right
as
we
can
be
,
Mrs
Bangham
,
and
we
shall
come
out
of
this
like
a
house
afire
;
"
and
as
he
and
Mrs
Bangham
took
possession
of
the
poor
helpless
pair
,
as
everybody
else
and
anybody
else
had
always
done
,
the
means
at
hand
were
as
good
on
the
whole
as
better
would
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
The
special
feature
in
Dr
Haggage
's
treatment
of
the
case
,
was
his
determination
to
keep
Mrs
Bangham
up
to
the
mark
.
 
<EOS>
As
thus
:
   
"
Mrs
Bangham
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
before
he
had
been
there
twenty
minutes
,
"
go
outside
and
fetch
a
little
brandy
,
or
we
shall
have
you
giving
in
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
none
on
my
accounts
,
"
said
Mrs
Bangham
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bangham
,
"
returned
the
doctor
,
"
I
am
in
professional
attendance
on
this
lady
,
and
do
n't
choose
to
allow
any
discussion
on
your
part
.
 
<EOS>
Go
outside
and
fetch
a
little
brandy
,
or
I
foresee
that
you
'll
break
down
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
to
be
obeyed
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Bangham
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
was
to
put
your
own
lips
to
it
,
I
think
you
would
n't
be
the
worse
,
for
you
look
but
poorly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bangham
,
"
returned
the
doctor
,
"
I
am
not
your
business
,
thank
you
,
but
you
are
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Never
you
mind
ME
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
have
got
to
do
,
is
,
to
do
as
you
are
told
,
and
to
go
and
get
what
I
bid
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Bangham
submitted
;
and
the
doctor
,
having
administered
her
potion
,
took
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
repeated
the
treatment
every
hour
,
being
very
determined
with
Mrs
Bangham
.
 
<EOS>
Three
or
four
hours
passed
;
the
flies
fell
into
the
traps
by
hundreds
;
and
at
length
one
little
life
,
hardly
stronger
than
theirs
,
appeared
among
the
multitude
of
lesser
deaths
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
nice
little
girl
indeed
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
little
,
but
well
-
formed
.
 
<EOS>
Halloa
,
Mrs
Bangham
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
looking
queer
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
off
,
ma'am
,
this
minute
,
and
fetch
a
little
more
brandy
,
or
we
shall
have
you
in
hysterics
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
rings
had
begun
to
fall
from
the
debtor
's
irresolute
hands
,
like
leaves
from
a
wintry
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Not
one
was
left
upon
them
that
night
,
when
he
put
something
that
chinked
into
the
doctor
's
greasy
palm
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mrs
Bangham
had
been
out
on
an
errand
to
a
neighbouring
establishment
decorated
with
three
golden
balls
,
where
she
was
very
well
known
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Your
good
lady
is
quite
composed
.
 
<EOS>
Doing
charmingly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
and
very
thankful
to
know
it
,
"
said
the
debtor
,
"
though
I
little
thought
once
,
that
---
"
   
"
That
a
child
would
be
born
to
you
in
a
place
like
this
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
,
bah
,
sir
,
what
does
it
signify
?
 
<EOS>
A
little
more
elbow
-
room
is
all
we
want
here
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
quiet
here
;
we
do
n't
get
badgered
here
;
there
's
no
knocker
here
,
sir
,
to
be
hammered
at
by
creditors
and
bring
a
man
's
heart
into
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
comes
here
to
ask
if
a
man
's
at
home
,
and
to
say
he
'll
stand
on
the
door
mat
till
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
writes
threatening
letters
about
money
to
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
freedom
,
sir
,
it
's
freedom
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
to
-
day
's
practice
at
home
and
abroad
,
on
a
march
,
and
aboard
ship
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
this
:
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
ever
pursued
it
under
such
quiet
circumstances
as
here
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
Elsewhere
,
people
are
restless
,
worried
,
hurried
about
,
anxious
respecting
one
thing
,
anxious
respecting
another
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
of
the
kind
here
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
done
all
that
---
we
know
the
worst
of
it
;
we
have
got
to
the
bottom
,
we
ca
n't
fall
,
and
what
have
we
found
?
 
<EOS>
Peace
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
word
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Peace
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
profession
of
faith
,
the
doctor
,
who
was
an
old
jail
-
bird
,
and
was
more
sodden
than
usual
,
and
had
the
additional
and
unusual
stimulus
of
money
in
his
pocket
,
returned
to
his
associate
and

,
and

.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
debtor
was
a
very
different
man
from
the
doctor
,
but
he
had
already
begun
to
travel
,
by
his
opposite
segment
of
the
circle
,
to
the
same
point
.
 
<EOS>
Crushed
at
first
by
his
imprisonment
,
he
had
soon
found
a
dull
relief
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
under
lock
and
key
;
but
the
lock
and
key
that
kept
him
in
,
kept
numbers
of
his
troubles
out
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
a
man
with
strength
of
purpose
to
face
those
troubles
and
fight
them
,
he
might
have
broken
the
net
that
held
him
,
or
broken
his
heart
;
but
being
what
he
was
,
he
languidly
slipped
into
this
smooth
descent
,
and
never
more
took
one
step
upward
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
was
relieved
of
the
perplexed
affairs
that
nothing
would
make
plain
,
through
having
them
returned
upon
his
hands
by
a
dozen
agents
in
succession
who
could
make
neither
beginning
,
middle
,
nor
end
of
them
or
him
,
he
found
his
miserable
place
of
refuge
a
quieter
refuge
than
it
had
been
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
unpacked
the
portmanteau
long
ago
;
and
his
elder
children
now
played
regularly
about
the
yard
,
and
everybody
knew
the
baby
,
and
claimed
a
kind
of
proprietorship
in
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
'm
getting
proud
of
you
,
"
said
his
friend
the
turnkey
,
one
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
the
oldest
inhabitant
soon
.
 
<EOS>
The
Marshalsea
would
n't
be
like
the
Marshalsea
now
,
without
you
and
your
family
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
really
was
proud
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
mention
him
in
laudatory
terms
to
new
-
comers
,
when
his
back
was
turned
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
took
notice
of
him
,
"
he
would
say
,
"
that
went
out
of
the
lodge
just
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
New
-
comer
would
probably
answer
Yes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brought
up
as
a
gentleman
,
he
was
,
if
ever
a
man
was
.
 
<EOS>
Ed'cated
at
no
end
of
expense
.
 
<EOS>
Went
into
the
Marshal
's
house
once
to
try
a
new
piano
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Played
it
<EOS>
,
I
understand
,
like
one
o'clock
---
beautiful
!
 
<EOS>
As
to
languages
---
speaks
anything
.
 
<EOS>
We
've
had
a
Frenchman
here
in
his
time
,
and
it
's
my
opinion
<EOS>
he
knowed
more
French
than
the
Frenchman
did
.
 
<EOS>
We
've
had
an
Italian
here
in
his
time
,
and
he
shut
him
up
in
about
half
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
find
some
characters
behind
other
locks
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
say
you
wo
n't
;
but
if
you
want
the
top
-
sawyer
in
such
respects
as
I
've
mentioned
,
you
must
come
to
the
Marshalsea
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
When
his
youngest
child
was
eight
years
old
,
his
wife
,
who
had
long
been
languishing
away
---
of
her
own
inherent
weakness
,
not
that
she
retained
any
greater
sensitiveness
as
to
her
place
of
abode
than
he
did
---
went
upon
a
visit
to
a
poor
friend
and
old
nurse
in
the
country
,
and
died
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
shut
up
in
his
room
for
a
fortnight
afterwards
;
and
an
attorney
's
clerk
,
who
was
going
through
the
Insolvent
Court
,
engrossed
an
address
of
condolence
to
him
,
which
looked
like
a
Lease
,
and
which
all
the
prisoners
signed
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
appeared
again
he
was
greyer
<EOS>
(
he
had
soon
begun
to
turn
grey
)
;
and
the
turnkey
noticed
that
his
hands
went
often
to
his
trembling
lips
again
,
as
they
had
used
to
do
when
he
first
came
in
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
got
pretty
well
over
it
in
a
month
or
two
;
and
in
the
meantime
the
children
played
about
the
yard
as
regularly
as
ever
,
but
in
black
.
   
<EOS>
Then
Mrs
Bangham
,
long
popular
medium
of
communication
with
the
outer
world
,
began
to
be
infirm
,
and
to
be
found
oftener
than
usual
comatose
on
pavements
,
with
her
basket
of
purchases
spilt
,
and
the
change
of
her
clients
ninepence
short
.
 
<EOS>
His
son
began
to
supersede
Mrs
Bangham
,
and
to
execute
commissions
in
a
knowing
manner
,
and
to
be
of
the
prison
prisonous
,
of
the
streets
streety
.
   
<EOS>
Time
went
on
,
and
the
turnkey
began
to
fail
.
 
<EOS>
His
chest
swelled
,
and
his
legs
got
weak
,
and
he
was
short
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
The
well
-
worn
wooden
stool
was
"
beyond
him
,
"
he
complained
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
in
an
arm
-
chair
with
a
cushion
,
and
sometimes
wheezed
so
,
for
minutes
together
,
that
he
could
n't
turn
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
overpowered
by
these
fits
,
the
debtor
often
turned
it
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
and
me
,
"
said
the
turnkey
,
one
snowy
winter
's
night
when
the
lodge
,
with
a
bright
fire
in
it
,
was
pretty
full
of
company
,
"
is
the
oldest
inhabitants
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
n't
here
myself
above
seven
year
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
'm
off
the
lock
for
good
and
all
,
you
'll
be
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
went
off
the
lock
of
this
world
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
His
words
were
remembered
and
repeated
;
and
tradition
afterwards
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
---
a
Marshalsea
generation
might
be
calculated
as
about
three
months
---
that
the
shabby
old
debtor
with
the
soft
manner
and
the
white
hair
,
was
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
And
he
grew
to
be
proud
of
the
title
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
impostor
had
arisen
to
claim
it
,
he
would
have
shed
tears
in
resentment
of
the
attempt
to
deprive
him
of
his
rights
.
 
<EOS>
A
disposition
began
to
be
perceived
in
him
to
exaggerate
the
number
of
years
he
had
been
there
;
it
was
generally
understood
that
you
must
deduct
a
few
from
his
account
;
he
was
vain
,
the
fleeting
generations
of
debtors
said
.
   
<EOS>
All
new
-
comers
were
presented
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
punctilious
in
the
exaction
of
this
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
The
wits
would
perform
the
office
of
introduction
with
overcharged
pomp
and
politeness
,
but
they
could
not
easily
overstep
his
sense
of
its
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
He
received
them
in
his
poor
room
<EOS>
(
he
disliked
an
introduction
in
the
mere
yard
,
as
informal
---
a
thing
that
might
happen
to
anybody
)
,
with
a
kind
of
bowed
-
down
beneficence
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
welcome
to
the
Marshalsea
,
he
would
tell
them
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
was
the
Father
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
world
was
kind
enough
to
call
him
;
and
so
he
was
,
if
more
than
twenty
years
of
residence
gave
him
a
claim
to
the
title
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
small
at
first
,
but
there
was
very
good
company
there
---
among
a
mixture
---
necessarily
a
mixture
---
and
very
good
air
.
   
<EOS>
It
became
a
not
unusual
circumstance
for
letters
to
be
put
under
his
door
at
night
,
enclosing
half
-
a
-
crown
,
two
half
-
crowns
,
now
and
then
at
long
intervals
even
half
-
a
-
sovereign
,
for
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
the
compliments
of
a
collegian
taking
leave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
received
the
gifts
as
tributes
,
from
admirers
,
to
a
public
character
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
these
correspondents
assumed
facetious
names
,
as
the
Brick
,
Bellows
,
Old
Gooseberry
,
Wideawake
,
Snooks
,
Mops
,
Cutaway
,
the
Dogs
-
meat
Man
;
but
he
considered
this
in
bad
taste
,
and
was
always
a
little
hurt
by
it
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
fulness
of
time
,
this
correspondence
showing
signs
of
wearing
out
,
and
seeming
to
require
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
correspondents
to
which
in
the
hurried
circumstances
of
departure
many
of
them
might
not
be
equal
,
he
established
the
custom
of
attending
collegians
of
a
certain
standing
,
to
the
gate
,
and
taking
leave
of
them
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
collegian
under
treatment
,
after
shaking
hands
,
would
occasionally
stop
to
wrap
up
something
in
a
bit
of
paper
,
and
would
come
back
again
calling
"
Hi
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
would
look
round
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
Me
?
<EOS>
"
he
would
say
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
collegian
would
be
up
with
him
,
and
he
would
paternally
add
,
"
What
have
you
forgotten
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
to
leave
this
,
"
the
collegian
would
usually
return
,
"
for
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
sir
,
"
he
would
rejoin
,
"
he
is
infinitely
obliged
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
to
the
last
,
the
irresolute
hand
of
old
would
remain
in
the
pocket
into
which
he
had
slipped
the
money
during
two
or
three
turns
about
the
yard
,
lest
the
transaction
should
be
too
conspicuous
to
the
general
body
of
collegians
.
   
<EOS>
One
afternoon
he
had
been
doing
the
honours
of
the
place
to
a
rather
large
party
of
collegians
,
who
happened
to
be
going
out
,
when
,
as
he
was
coming
back
,
he
encountered
one
from
the
poor
side
who
had
been
taken
in
execution
for
a
small
sum
a
week
before
,
had
"
settled
"
in
the
course
of
that
afternoon
,
and
was
going
out
too
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
a
mere
Plasterer
in
his
working
dress
;
had
his
wife
with
him
,
and
a
bundle
;
and
was
in
high
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
sir
,
"
he
said
in
passing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
"
benignantly
returned
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
pretty
far
divided
,
going
their
several
ways
,
when
the
Plasterer
called
out
,
"
I
say
!
<EOS>
---
sir
!
"
and
came
back
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
much
,
"
said
the
Plasterer
,
putting
a
little
pile
of
halfpence
in
his
hand
,
"
but
<EOS>
it
's
well
meant
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
had
never
been
offered
tribute
in
copper
yet
.
 
<EOS>
His
children
often
had
,
and
with
his
perfect
acquiescence
it
had
gone
into
the
common
purse
to
buy
meat
that
he
had
eaten
,
and
drink
that
he
had
drunk
;
but
fustian
splashed
with
white
lime
,
bestowing
halfpence
on
him
,
front
to
front
,
was
new
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
the
man
,
and
feebly
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
The
Plasterer
turned
him
towards
the
wall
,
that
his
face
might
not
be
seen
;
and
the
action
was
so
delicate
,
and
the
man
was
so
penetrated
with
repentance
,
and
asked
pardon
so
honestly
,
that
he
could
make
him
no
less
acknowledgment
than
,
"
I
know
you
meant
it
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
Say
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
soul
,
sir
,
"
urged
the
Plasterer
,
"
I
did
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
do
more
by
you
than
the
rest
of
'em
do
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
come
back
to
see
you
,
after
I
was
let
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
money
again
,
"
said
the
other
,
eagerly
,
"
and
I
'll
keep
it
,
and
never
spend
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
for
it
,
thank
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
again
?
"
<EOS>
"
If
I
live
a
week
you
shall
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
shook
hands
and
parted
.
 
<EOS>
The
collegians
,
assembled
in
Symposium
in
the
Snuggery
that
night
,
marvelled
what
had
happened
to
their
Father
;
he
walked
so
late
in
the
shadows
of
the
yard
,
and
seemed
so
downcast
.
    
Chapter

<EOS>
The
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
 
<EOS>
The
baby
whose
first
draught
of
air
had
been
tinctured
with
Doctor
Haggage
's
brandy
,
was
handed
down
among
the
generations
of
collegians
,
like
the
tradition
of
their
common
parent
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
earlier
stages
of
her
existence
,
she
was
handed
down
in
a
literal
and
prosaic
sense
;
it
being
almost
a
part
of
the
entrance
footing
of
every
new
collegian
to
nurse
the
child
who
had
been
born
in
the
college
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
rights
,
"
remarked
the
turnkey
when
she
was
first
shown
to
him
,
"
I
ought
to
be
her
godfather
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
debtor
irresolutely
thought
of
it
for
a
minute
,
and
said
,
"
Perhaps
you
would
n't
object
to
really
being
her
godfather
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
\I\
do
n't
object
,
"
replied
the
turnkey
,
"
if
you
do
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
to
pass
that
she
was
christened
one
Sunday
afternoon
,
when
the
turnkey
,
being
relieved
,
was
off
the
lock
;
and
that
the
turnkey
went
up
to
the
font
of
Saint
George
's
Church
,
and
promised
and
vowed
and
renounced
on
her
behalf
,
as
he
himself
related
when
he
came
back
,
"
like
a
good
'
un
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
invested
the
turnkey
with
a
new
proprietary
share
in
the
child
,
over
and
above
his
former
official
one
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
began
to
walk
and
talk
,
he
became
fond
of
her
;
bought
a
little
arm
-
chair
and
stood
it
by
the
high
fender
of
the
lodge
fire
-
place
;
liked
to
have
her
company
when
he
was
on
the
lock
;
and
used
to
bribe
her
with
cheap
toys
to
come
and
talk
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
,
for
her
part
,
soon
grew
so
fond
of
the
turnkey
that
she
would
come
climbing
up
the
lodge
-
steps
of
her
own
accord
at
all
hours
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
fell
asleep
in
the
little
armchair
by
the
high
fender
,
the
turnkey
would
cover
her
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
and
when
she
sat
in
it
dressing
and
undressing
a
doll
which
soon
came
to
be
unlike
dolls
on
the
other
side
of
the
lock
,
and
to
bear
a
horrible
family
resemblance
to
Mrs
Bangham
---
he
would
contemplate
her
from
the
top
of
his
stool
with
exceeding
gentleness
.
 
<EOS>
Witnessing
these
things
,
the
collegians
would
express
an
opinion
that
the
turnkey
,
who
was
a
bachelor
,
had
been
cut
out
by
nature
for
a
family
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
turnkey
thanked
them
,
and
said
,
"
No
,
on
the
whole
it
was
enough
to
see
other
people
's
children
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
what
period
of
her
early
life
the
little
creature
began
to
perceive
that
it
was
not
the
habit
of
all
the
world
to
live
locked
up
in
narrow
yards
surrounded
by
high
walls
with
spikes
at
the
top
,
would
be
a
difficult
question
to
settle
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
a
very
,
very
little
creature
indeed
,
when
she
had
somehow
gained
the
knowledge
that
her
clasp
of
her
father
's
hand
was
to
be
always
loosened
at
the
door
which
the
great
key
opened
;
and
that
while
her
own
light
steps
were
free
to
pass
beyond
it
,
his
feet
must
never
cross
that
line
.
 
<EOS>
A
pitiful
and
plaintive
look
,
with
which
she
had
begun
to
regard
him
when
she
was
still
extremely
young
,
was
perhaps
a
part
of
this
discovery
.
   
<EOS>
With
a
pitiful
and
plaintive
look
for
everything
,
indeed
,
but
with
something
in
it
for
only
him
that
was
like
protection
,
this
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
and
the
child
of
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
sat
by
her
friend
the
turnkey
in
the
lodge
,
kept
the
family
room
,
or
wandered
about
the
prison
-
yard
,
for
the
first
eight
years
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
pitiful
and
plaintive
look
for
her
wayward
sister
;
for
her
idle
brother
;
for
the
high
blank
walls
;
for
the
faded
crowd
they
shut
in
;
for
the
games
of
the
prison
children
as
they
whooped
and
ran
,
and
played
at
hide
-
and
-
seek
,
and
made
the
iron
bars
of
the
inner
gateway
"
Home
.
"
   
Wistful
and
wondering
,
she
would
sit
in
summer
weather
by
the
high
fender
in
the
lodge
,
looking
up
at
the
sky
through
the
barred
window
,
until
,
when
she
turned
her
eyes
away
,
bars
of
light
would
arise
between
her
and
her
friend
,
and
she
would
see
him
through
a
grating
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
Thinking
of
the
fields
,
"
the
turnkey
said
once
,
after
watching
her
,
"
ai
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
they
're
---
over
there
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
turnkey
,
with
a
vague
flourish
of
his
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
about
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
anybody
open
them
,
and
shut
them
?
 
<EOS>
Are
they
locked
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
was
discomfited
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
very
pretty
,
Bob
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
called
him
Bob
,
by
his
own
particular
request
and
instruction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lovely
.
 
<EOS>
Full
of
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
buttercups
,
and
there
's
daisies
,
and
there
's
"
---
the
turnkey
hesitated
,
being
short
of
floral
nomenclature
<EOS>
---
"
there
's
dandelions
,
and
all
manner
of
games
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
very
pleasant
to
be
there
,
Bob
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Prime
,
"
said
the
turnkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
father
ever
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
coughed
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
yes
,
he
was
there
,
sometimes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
sorry
not
to
be
there
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
not
particular
,
"
said
the
turnkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
any
of
the
people
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
glancing
at
the
listless
crowd
within
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
are
you
quite
sure
and
certain
,
Bob
?
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
difficult
point
of
the
conversation
Bob
gave
in
,
and
changed
the
subject
to
hard
-
bake
:
always
his
last
resource
when
he
found
his
little
friend
getting
him
into
a
political
,
social
,
or
theological
corner
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
the
origin
of
a
series
of
Sunday
excursions
that
these
two
curious
companions
made
together
.
 
<EOS>
They
used
to
issue
from
the
lodge
on
alternate
Sunday
afternoons
with
great
gravity
,
bound
for
some
meadows
or
green
lanes
that
had
been
elaborately
appointed
by
the
turnkey
in
the
course
of
the
week
;
and
there
she
picked
grass
and
flowers
to
bring
home
,
while
he
smoked
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
there
were
tea
-
gardens
,
shrimps
,
ale
,
and
other
delicacies
;
and
then
they
would
come
back
hand
in
hand
,
unless
she
was
more
than
usually
tired
,
and
had
fallen
asleep
on
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
In
those
early
days
,
the
turnkey
first
began
profoundly
to
consider
a
question
which
cost
him
so
much
mental
labour
,
that
it
remained
undetermined
on
the
day
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
decided
to
will
and
bequeath
his
little
property
of
savings
to
his
godchild
,
and
the
point
arose
how
could
it
be
so
"
tied
up
"
as
that
only
she
should
have
the
benefit
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
His
experience
on
the
lock
gave
him
such
an
acute
perception
of
the
enormous
difficulty
of
"
tying
up
"
money
with
any
approach
to
tightness
,
and
contrariwise
of
the
remarkable
ease
with
which
it
got
loose
,
that
through
a
series
of
years
he
regularly
propounded
this
knotty
point
to
every
new
insolvent
agent
and
other
professional
gentleman
who
passed
in
and
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Supposing
,
"
he
would
say
,
stating
the
case
with
his
key
on
the
professional
gentleman
's
waistcoat
;
"
supposing
a
man
wanted
to
leave
his
property
to
a
young
female
,
and
wanted
to
tie
it
up
so
that
nobody
else
should
ever
be
able
to
make
a
grab
at
it
;
how
would
you
tie
up
that
property
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Settle
it
strictly
on
herself
,
"
the
professional
gentleman
would
complacently
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
look
here
,
"
quoth
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Supposing
she
had
,
say
a
brother
,
say
a
father
,
say
a
husband
,
who
would
be
likely
to
make
a
grab
at
that
property
when
she
came
into
it
---
how
about
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
settled
on
herself
,
and
they
would
have
no
more
legal
claim
on
it
than
you
,
"
would
be
the
professional
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
bit
,
"
said
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Supposing
<EOS>
she
was
tender
-
hearted
,
and
they
came
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
your
law
for
tying
it
up
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
deepest
character
whom
the
turnkey
sounded
,
was
unable
to
produce
his
law
for
tying
such
a
knot
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
turnkey
thought
about
it
all
his
life
,
and
died
intestate
after
all
.
   
<EOS>
But
that
was
long
afterwards
,
when
his
god
-
daughter
was
past
sixteen
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
half
of
that
space
of
her
life
was
only
just
accomplished
,
when
her
pitiful
and
plaintive
look
saw
her
father
a
widower
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
time
the
protection
that
her
wondering
eyes
had
expressed
towards
him
,
became
embodied
in
action
,
and
the
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
took
upon
herself
a
new
relation
towards
the
Father
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
,
such
a
baby
could
do
little
more
than
sit
with
him
,
deserting
her
livelier
place
by
the
high
fender
,
and
quietly
watching
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
made
her
so
far
necessary
to
him
that
he
became
accustomed
to
her
,
and
began
to
be
sensible
of
missing
her
when
she
was
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
Through
this
little
gate
,
she
passed
out
of
childhood
into
the
care
-
laden
world
.
   
<EOS>
What
her
pitiful
look
saw
,
at
that
early
time
,
in
her
father
,
in
her
sister
,
in
her
brother
,
in
the
jail
;
how
much
,
or
how
little
of
the
wretched
truth
it
pleased
God
to
make
visible
to
her
;
lies
hidden
with
many
mysteries
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
that
she
was
inspired
to
be
something
which
was
not
what
the
rest
were
,
and
to
be
that
something
,
different
and
laborious
,
for
the
sake
of
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Inspired
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
speak
of
the
inspiration
of
a
poet
or
a
priest
,
and
not
of
the
heart
<EOS>
impelled
by
love
and
self
-
devotion
to
the
lowliest
work
in
the
lowliest
way
of
life
!
   
<EOS>
With
no
earthly
friend
to
help
her
,
or
so
much
as
to
see
her
,
but
the
one
so
strangely
assorted
;
with
no
knowledge
even
of
the
common
daily
tone
and
habits
of
the
common
members
of
the
free
community
who
are
not
shut
up
in
prisons
;
born
and
bred
in
a
social
condition
,
false
even
with
a
reference
to
the
falsest
condition
outside
the
walls
;
drinking
from
infancy
of
a
well
whose
waters
had
their
own
peculiar
stain
,
their
own
unwholesome
and
unnatural
taste
;
the
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
began
her
womanly
life
.
   
<EOS>
No
matter
through
what
mistakes
and
discouragements
,
what
ridicule
(
not
unkindly
meant
,
but
deeply
felt
)
of
her
youth
and
little
figure
,
what
humble
consciousness
of
her
own
babyhood
and
want
of
strength
,
even
in
the
matter
of
lifting
and
carrying
;
through
how
much
weariness
and
hopelessness
,
and
how
many
secret
tears
;
she
drudged
on
,
until
recognised
as
useful
,
even
indispensable
.
 
<EOS>
That
time
came
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
the
place
of
eldest
of
the
three
,
in
all
things
but
precedence
;
was
the
head
of
the
fallen
family
;
and
bore
,
in
her
own
heart
,
its
anxieties
and
shames
.
   
<EOS>
At
thirteen
,
she
could
read
and
keep
accounts
,
that
is
,
could
put
down
in
words
and
figures
how
much
the
bare
necessaries
that
they
wanted
would
cost
,
and
how
much
less
they
had
to
buy
them
with
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
,
by
snatches
of
a
few
weeks
at
a
time
,
to
an
evening
school
outside
,
and
got
her
sister
and
brother
sent
to
day
-
schools
by
desultory
starts
,
during
three
or
four
years
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
instruction
for
any
of
them
at
home
;
but
she
knew
well
---
no
one
better
---
that
a
man
so
broken
as
to
be
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
could
be
no
father
to
his
own
children
.
   
<EOS>
To
these
scanty
means
of
improvement
,
she
added
another
of
her
own
contriving
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
among
the
heterogeneous
crowd
of
inmates
there
appeared
a
dancing
-
master
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
had
a
great
desire
to
learn
the
dancing
-
master
's
art
,
and
seemed
to
have
a
taste
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
At
thirteen
years
old
,
the
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
presented
herself
to
the
dancing
-
master
,
with
a
little
bag
in
her
hand
,
and
preferred
her
humble
petition
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
please
,
I
was
born
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
the
young
lady
,
are
you
?
"
said
the
dancing
-
master
,
surveying
the
small
figure
and
uplifted
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
said
the
dancing
-
master
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
for
me
,
sir
,
thank
you
,
"
anxiously
undrawing
the
strings
of
the
little
bag
;
"
but
if
,
while
you
stay
here
,
you
could
be
so
kind
as
to
teach
my
sister
<EOS>
cheap
---
"
   
"
My
child
,
I
'll
teach
her
for
nothing
,
"
said
the
dancing
-
master
,
shutting
up
the
bag
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
good
-
natured
a
dancing
-
master
as
ever
danced
to
the
Insolvent
Court
,
and
he
kept
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
The
sister
was
so
apt
a
pupil
,
and
the
dancing
-
master
had
such
abundant
leisure
to
bestow
upon
her
<EOS>
(
for
it
took
him
a
matter
of
ten
weeks
to
set
to
his
creditors
,
lead
off
,
turn
the
Commissioners
,
and
right
and
left
back
to
his
professional
pursuits
)
,
that
wonderful
progress
was
made
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
the
dancing
-
master
was
so
proud
of
it
,
and
so
wishful
to
display
it
before
he
left
to
a
few
select
friends
among
the
collegians
,
that
at
six
o'clock
on
a
certain
fine
morning
,
a
minuet
de
la
cour
came
off
in
the
yard
---
the
college
-
rooms
being
of
too
confined
proportions
for
the
purpose
---
in
which
so
much
ground
was
covered
,
and
the
steps
were
so
conscientiously
executed
,
that
the
dancing
-
master
,
having
to
play
the
kit
besides
,
was
thoroughly
blown
.
   
<EOS>
The
success
of
this
beginning
,
which
led
to
the
dancing
-
master
's
continuing
his
instruction
after
his
release
,
emboldened
the
poor
child
to
try
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
watched
and
waited
months
for
a
seamstress
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
fulness
of
time
a
milliner
came
in
,
and
to
her
she
repaired
on
her
own
behalf
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
"
she
said
,
looking
timidly
round
the
door
of
the
milliner
,
whom
she
found
in
tears
and
in
bed
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
was
born
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Everybody
seemed
to
hear
of
her
as
soon
as
they
arrived
;
for
the
milliner
sat
up
in
bed
,
drying
her
eyes
,
and
said
,
just
as
the
dancing
-
master
had
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
the
child
,
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
I
have
n't
got
anything
for
you
,
"
said
the
milliner
,
shaking
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
that
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
please
I
want
to
learn
needle
-
work
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
do
that
,
"
returned
the
milliner
,
"
with
me
before
you
?
 
<EOS>
It
has
not
done
me
much
good
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
---
whatever
it
is
---
seems
to
have
done
anybody
much
good
who
comes
here
,
"
she
returned
in
all
simplicity
;
"
but
I
want
to
learn
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
are
so
weak
,
you
see
,
"
the
milliner
objected
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
am
weak
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
are
so
very
,
very
little
,
you
see
,
"
the
milliner
objected
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
afraid
I
am
very
little
indeed
,
"
returned
the
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
;
and
so
began
to
sob
over
that
unfortunate
defect
of
hers
,
which
came
so
often
in
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
milliner
---
who
was
not
morose
or
hard
-
hearted
,
only
newly
insolvent
---
was
touched
,
took
her
in
hand
with
goodwill
,
found
her
the
most
patient
and
earnest
of
pupils
,
and
made
her
a
cunning
work
-
woman
in
course
of
time
.
   
<EOS>
In
course
of
time
,
and
in
the
very
self
-
same
course
of
time
,
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
gradually
developed
a
new
flower
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
Fatherly
he
grew
as
to
the
Marshalsea
,
and
the
more
dependent
he
became
on
the
contributions
of
his
changing
family
,
the
greater
stand
he
made
by
his
forlorn
gentility
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
same
hand
that
he
pocketed
a
collegian
's
half
-
crown
half
an
hour
ago
,
he
would
wipe
away
the
tears
that
streamed
over
his
cheeks
if
any
reference
were
made
to
his
daughters
'
earning
their
bread
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
over
and
above
other
daily
cares
,
the
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
had
always
upon
her
the
care
of
preserving
the
genteel
fiction
that
they
were
all
idle
beggars
together
.
   
<EOS>
The
sister
became
a
dancer
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
ruined
uncle
in
the
family
group
---
ruined
by
his
brother
,
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
and
knowing
no
more
how
than
his
ruiner
did
,
but
accepting
the
fact
as
an
inevitable
certainty
---
on
whom
her
protection
devolved
.
<EOS>
Naturally
a
retired
and
simple
man
,
he
had
shown
no
particular
sense
of
being
ruined
at
the
time
when
that
calamity
fell
upon
him
,
further
than
that
he
left
off
washing
himself
when
the
shock
was
announced
,
and
never
took
to
that
luxury
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
very
indifferent
musical
amateur
in
his
better
days
;
and
when
he
fell
with
his
brother
,
resorted
for
support
to
playing
a
clarionet
as
dirty
as
himself
in
a
small
Theatre
Orchestra
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
theatre
in
which
his
niece
became
a
dancer
;
he
had
been
a
fixture
there
a
long
time
when
she
took
her
poor
station
in
it
;
and
he
accepted
the
task
of
serving
as
her
escort
and
guardian
,
just
as
he
would
have
accepted
an
illness
,
a
legacy
,
a
feast
,
starvation
---
anything
but
soap
.
   
<EOS>
To
enable
this
girl
to
earn
her
few
weekly
shillings
,
it
was
necessary
for
the
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
to
go
through
an
elaborate
form
with
the
Father
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
is
not
going
to
live
with
us
just
now
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
here
a
good
deal
in
the
day
,
but
she
is
going
to
live
outside
with
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
uncle
wants
a
companion
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
should
be
attended
to
,
and
looked
after
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
companion
?
 
<EOS>
He
passes
much
of
his
time
here
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
attend
to
him
and
look
after
him
,
Amy
,
a
great
deal
more
than
ever
your
sister
will
.
 
<EOS>
You
all
go
out
so
much
;
you
all
go
out
so
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
to
keep
up
the
ceremony
and
pretence
of
his
having
no
idea
that
Amy
herself
went
out
by
the
day
to
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
we
are
always
glad
to
come
home
,
father
;
now
,
are
we
not
?
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
Fanny
,
perhaps
besides
keeping
uncle
company
and
taking
care
of
him
,
it
may
be
as
well
for
her
not
quite
to
live
here
,
always
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
born
here
as
I
was
,
you
know
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Amy
,
<EOS>
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quite
follow
you
,
but
it
's
natural
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
Fanny
should
prefer
to
be
outside
,
and
even
that
you
often
should
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
you
and
Fanny
and
your
uncle
,
my
dear
,
shall
have
your
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
Good
,
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
meddle
;
do
n't
mind
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
get
her
brother
out
of
the
prison
;
out
of
the
succession
to
Mrs
Bangham
in
executing
commissions
,
and
out
of
the
slang
interchange
with
very
doubtful
companions
consequent
upon
both
;
was
her
hardest
task
.
 
<EOS>
At
eighteen
he
would
have
dragged
on
from
hand
to
mouth
,
from
hour
to
hour
,
from
penny
to
penny
,
until
eighty
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
got
into
the
prison
from
whom
he
derived
anything
useful
or
good
,
and
she
could
find
no
patron
for
him
but
her
old
friend
and
godfather
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Bob
,
"
said
she
,
"
what
is
to
become
of
poor
Tip
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
name
was
Edward
,
and
Ted
had
been
transformed
into
Tip
,
within
the
walls
.
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
had
strong
private
opinions
as
to
what
would
become
of
poor
Tip
,
and
had
even
gone
so
far
with
the
view
of
averting
their
fulfilment
,
as
to
sound
Tip
in
reference
to
the
expediency
of
running
away
and
going
to
serve
his
country
.
 
<EOS>
But
Tip
had
thanked
him
,
and
said
he
did
n't
seem
to
care
for
his
country
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
turnkey
,
"
something
ought
to
be
done
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
I
try
and
get
him
into
the
law
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
so
good
of
you
,
Bob
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
had
now
two
points
to
put
to
the
professional
gentlemen
as
they
passed
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
this
second
one
so
perseveringly
that
a
stool
and
twelve
shillings
a
week
were
at
last
found
for
Tip
in
the
office
of
an
attorney
in
a
great
National
Palladium
called
the
Palace
Court
;
at
that
time
one
of
a
considerable
list
of
everlasting
bulwarks
to
the
dignity
and
safety
of
Albion
,
whose
places
know
them
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
Tip
languished
in
Clifford
's
Inns
for
six
months
,
and
at
the
expiration
of
that
term
sauntered
back
one
evening
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
incidentally
observed
to
his
sister
that
he
was
not
going
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
going
back
again
?
"
said
the
poor
little
anxious
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
,
always
calculating
and
planning
for
Tip
,
in
the
front
rank
of
her
charges
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
tired
of
it
,
"
said
Tip
,
"
that
I
have
cut
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tip
tired
of
everything
.
 
<EOS>
With
intervals
of
Marshalsea
lounging
,
and
Mrs
Bangham
succession
,
his
small
second
mother
,
aided
by
her
trusty
friend
,
got
him
into
a
warehouse
,
into
a
market
garden
,
into
the
hop
trade
,
into
the
law
again
,
into
an
auctioneers
,
into
a
brewery
,
into
a
stockbroker
's
,
into
the
law
again
,
into
a
coach
office
,
into
a
waggon
office
,
into
the
law
again
,
into
a
general
dealer
's
,
into
a
distillery
,
into
the
law
again
,
into
a
wool
house
,
into
a
dry
goods
house
,
into
the
Billingsgate
trade
,
into
the
foreign
fruit
trade
,
and
into
the
docks
.
 
<EOS>
But
whatever
Tip
went
into
,
he
came
out
of
tired
,
announcing
that
he
had
cut
it
.
<EOS>
Wherever
he
went
,
this
foredoomed
Tip
appeared
to
take
the
prison
walls
with
him
,
and
to
set
them
up
in
such
trade
or
calling
;
and
to
prowl
about
within
their
narrow
limits
in
the
old
slip
-
shod
,
purposeless
,
down
-
at
-
heel
way
;
until
the
real
immovable
Marshalsea
walls
asserted
their
fascination
over
him
,
and
brought
him
back
.
   
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
brave
little
creature
did
so
fix
her
heart
on
her
brother
's
rescue
,
that
while
he
was
ringing
out
these
doleful
changes
,
she
pinched
and
scraped
enough
together
to
ship
him
for
Canada
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
tired
of
nothing
to
do
,
and
disposed
in
its
turn
to
cut
even
that
,
he
graciously
consented
to
go
to
Canada
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
grief
in
her
bosom
over
parting
with
him
,
and
joy
in
the
hope
of
his
being
put
in
a
straight
course
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
Tip
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
too
proud
to
come
and
see
us
,
when
you
have
made
your
fortune
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
!
"
said
Tip
,
and
went
.
   
<EOS>
But
not
all
the
way
to
Canada
;
in
fact
,
not
further
than
Liverpool
.
   
<EOS>
After
making
the
voyage
to
that
port
from
London
,
he
found
himself
so
strongly
impelled
to
cut
the
vessel
,
that
he
resolved
to
walk
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
Carrying
out
which
intention
,
he
presented
himself
before
her
at
the
expiration
of
a
month
,
in
rags
,
without
shoes
,
and
much
more
tired
than
ever
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
another
interval
of
successorship
to
Mrs
Bangham
,
he
found
a
pursuit
for
himself
,
and
announced
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
I
have
got
a
situation
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
really
and
truly
,
Tip
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
do
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
look
anxious
about
me
any
more
,
old
girl
.

"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Tip
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
know
Slingo
by
sight
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
the
man
they
call
the
dealer
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
chap
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
be
out
on
Monday
,
and
he
's
going
to
give
me
a
berth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
a
dealer
in
,
Tip
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Horses
.
 
<EOS>
All
right
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
do
now
,
Amy
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
lost
sight
of
him
for
months
afterwards
,
and
only
heard
from
him
once
.
 
<EOS>
A
whisper
passed
among
the
elder
collegians
that
he
had
been
seen
at
a
mock
auction
in
Moorfields
,
pretending
to
buy
plated
articles
for
massive
silver
,
and
paying
for
them
with
the
greatest
liberality
in
bank
notes
;
but
it
never
reached
her
ears
.
 
<EOS>
One
evening
she
was
alone
at
work
---
standing
up
at
the
window
,
to
save
the
twilight
lingering
above
the
wall
---
<EOS>
when
he
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
.
   
<EOS>
She
kissed
and
welcomed
him
;
but
was
afraid
to
ask
him
any
questions
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
how
anxious
and
timid
she
was
,
and
appeared
sorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
Amy
,
you
'll
be
vexed
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
I
am
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
,
Tip
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
---
yes
.
"
   
"
Not
expecting
this
time
that
what
you
had
found
would
answer
very
well
,
I
am
less
surprised
and
sorry
than
I
might
have
been
,
Tip
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
But
that
's
not
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
worst
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
look
so
startled
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Amy
,
not
the
worst
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
back
,
you
see
;
but
---
DON'T
look
so
startled
<EOS>
---
I
have
come
back
in
what
I
may
call
a
new
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
off
the
volunteer
list
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
now
,
as
one
of
the
regulars
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
you
are
a
prisoner
,
Tip
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
do
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
want
to
say
it
,
"
he
returned
in
a
reluctant
tone
;
"
but
if
you
ca
n't
understand
me
without
my
saying
it
,
what
am
I
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
for
forty
pound
odd
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
all
those
years
,
she
sunk
under
her
cares
.
<EOS>
She
cried
,
with
her
clasped
hands
lifted
above
her
head
,
that
it
would
kill
their
father
if
he
ever
knew
it
;
and
fell
down
at
Tip
's
graceless
feet
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
easier
for
Tip
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
than
for
her
to
bring
him
to
understand
that
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
would
be
beside
himself
if
he
knew
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
The
thing
was
incomprehensible
to
Tip
,
and
altogether
a
fanciful
notion
.
 
<EOS>
He
yielded
to
it
in
that
light
only
,
when
he
submitted
to
her
entreaties
,
backed
by
those
of
his
uncle
and
sister
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
want
of
precedent
for
his
return
;
it
was
accounted
for
to
the
father
in
the
usual
way
;
and
the
collegians
,
with
a
better
comprehension
of
the
pious
fraud
than
Tip
,
supported
it
loyally
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
life
,
and
this
the
history
,
of
the
child
of
the
Marshalsea
at
twenty
-
two
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
still
surviving
attachment
to
the
one
miserable
yard
and
block
of
houses
as
her
birthplace
and
home
,
she
passed
to
and
fro
in
it
shrinkingly
now
,
with
a
womanly
consciousness
that
she
was
pointed
out
to
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
Since
she
had
begun
to
work
beyond
the
walls
,
she
had
found
it
necessary
to
conceal
where
she
lived
,
and
to
come
and
go
as
secretly
as
she
could
,
between
the
free
city
and
the
iron
gates
,
outside
of
which
she
had
never
slept
in
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
Her
original
timidity
had
grown
with
this
concealment
,
and
her
light
step
and
her
little
figure
shunned
the
thronged
streets
while
they
passed
along
them
.
   
<EOS>
Worldly
wise
in
hard
and
poor
necessities
,
she
was
innocent
in
all
things
else
.
 
<EOS>
Innocent
,
in
the
mist
through
which
she
saw
her
father
,
and
the
prison
,
and
the
turbid
living
river
that
flowed
through
it
and
flowed
on
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
life
,
and
this
the
history
,
of
Little
Dorrit
;
now
going
home
upon
a
dull
September
evening
,
observed
at
a
distance
by
Arthur
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
life
,
and
this
the
history
,
of
Little
Dorrit
;
turning
at
the
end
of
London
Bridge
,
recrossing
it
,
going
back
again
,
passing
on
to
Saint
George
's
Church
,
turning
back
suddenly
once
more
,
and
flitting
in
at
the
open
outer
gate
and
little
court
-
yard
of
the
Marshalsea
.

Chapter
08
.
<EOS>
The
Lock
 
Arthur
Clennam
stood
in
the
street
,
waiting
to
ask
some
passer
-
by
what
place
that
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
suffered
a
few
people
to
pass
him
in
whose
face
there
was
no
encouragement
to
make
the
inquiry
,
and
still
stood
pausing
in
the
street
,
when
an
old
man
came
up
and
turned
into
the
courtyard
.
   
<EOS>
He
stooped
a
good
deal
,
and
plodded
along
in
a
slow
pre
-
occupied
manner
,
which
made
the
bustling
London
thoroughfares
no
very
safe
resort
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dirtily
and
meanly
dressed
,
in
a
threadbare
coat
,
once
blue
,
reaching
to
his
ankles
and
buttoned
to
his
chin
,
where
it
vanished
in
the
pale
ghost
of
a
velvet
collar
.
 
<EOS>
A
piece
of
red
cloth
with
which
that
phantom
had
been
stiffened
in
its
lifetime
was
now
laid
bare
,
and
poked
itself
up
,
at
the
back
of
the
old
man
's
neck
,
into
a
confusion
of
grey
hair
and
rusty
stock
and
buckle
which
altogether
nearly
poked
his
hat
off
.
 
<EOS>
A
greasy
hat
it
was
,
and
a
napless
;
impending
over
his
eyes
,
cracked
and
crumpled
at
the
brim
,
and
with
a
wisp
of
pocket
-
handkerchief
dangling
out
below
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
trousers
were
so
long
and
loose
,
and
his
shoes
so
clumsy
and
large
,
that
he
shuffled
like
an
elephant
;
though
how
much
of
this
was
gait
,
and
how
much
trailing
cloth
and
leather
,
no
one
could
have
told
.
 
<EOS>
Under
one
arm
he
carried
a
limp
and
worn
-
out
case
,
containing
some
wind
instrument
;
in
the
same
hand
he
had
a
pennyworth
of
snuff
in
a
little
packet
of
whitey
-
brown
paper
,
from
which
he
slowly
comforted
his
poor
blue
old
nose
with
a
lengthened
-
out
pinch
,
as
Arthur
Clennam
looked
at
him
.
<EOS>
To
this
old
man
crossing
the
court
-
yard
,
he
preferred
his
inquiry
,
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
stopped
and
looked
round
,
with
the
expression
in
his
weak
grey
eyes
of
one
whose
thoughts
had
been
far
off
,
and
who
was
a
little
dull
of
hearing
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
said
Arthur
,
repeating
his
question
,
"
what
is
this
place
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
 
<EOS>
This
place
?
"
returned
the
old
man
,
staying
his
pinch
of
snuff
on
its
road
,
and
pointing
at
the
place
without
looking
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
Marshalsea
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
debtors
'
prison
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
with
the
air
of
deeming
it
not
quite
necessary
to
insist
upon
that
designation
,
"
the
debtors
'
prison
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
turned
himself
about
,
and
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
Arthur
,
stopping
him
once
more
,
"
but
<EOS>
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
another
question
?
 
<EOS>
Can
any
one
go
in
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Any
one
can
go
IN
,
"
replied
the
old
man
;
plainly
adding
by
the
significance
of
his
emphasis
,
"
but
it
is
not
every
one
who
can
go
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
familiar
with
the
place
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
the
old
man
,
squeezing
his
little
packet
of
snuff
in
his
hand
,
and
turning
upon
his
interrogator
as
if
such
questions
hurt
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
to
excuse
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
impertinently
curious
,
but
have
a
good
object
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
the
name
of
Dorrit
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
old
man
most
unexpectedly
,
"
is
Dorrit
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
pulled
off
his
hat
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Grant
me
the
favour
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
words
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
wholly
unprepared
for
your
announcement
,
and
hope
that
assurance
is
my
sufficient
apology
for
having
taken
the
liberty
of
addressing
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
recently
come
home
to
England
after
a
long
absence
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
at
my
mother
's
---
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
in
the
city
---
a
young
woman
working
at
her
needle
,
whom
I
have
only
heard
addressed
or
spoken
of
as
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
felt
sincerely
interested
in
her
,
and
have
had
a
great
desire
to
know
something
more
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
,
not
a
minute
before
you
came
up
,
pass
in
at
that
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
at
him
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
sailor
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
a
little
disappointed
by
the
shake
of
the
head
that
replied
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
sailor
?
 
<EOS>
I
judged
from
your
sunburnt
face
that
you
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
in
earnest
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
that
I
am
,
and
do
entreat
you
to
believe
that
I
am
,
in
plain
earnest
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
very
little
of
the
world
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
other
,
who
had
a
weak
and
quavering
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
merely
passing
on
,
like
the
shadow
over
the
sun
-
dial
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
worth
no
man
's
while
to
mislead
me
;
it
would
really
be
too
easy
---
too
poor
a
success
,
to
yield
any
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
woman
whom
you
saw
go
in
here
is
my
brother
's
child
.
 
<EOS>
My
brother
is
William
Dorrit
;
I
am
Frederick
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
have
seen
her
at
your
mother
's
<EOS>
(
I
know
your
mother
befriends
her
)
,
you
have
felt
an
interest
in
her
,
and
you
wish
to
know
what
she
does
here
.
 
<EOS>
Come
and
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
went
on
again
,
and
Arthur
accompanied
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
brother
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
pausing
on
the
step
and
slowly
facing
round
again
,
"
has
been
here
many
years
;
and
much
that
happens
even
among
ourselves
,
out
of
doors
,
is
kept
from
him
for
reasons
that
I
need
n't
enter
upon
now
.
 
<EOS>
Be
so
good
as
to
say
nothing
of
my
niece
's
working
at
her
needle
.
 
<EOS>
Be
so
good
as
to
say
nothing
that
goes
beyond
what
is
said
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
keep
within
our
bounds
,
you
can
not
well
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Now
!
 
<EOS>
Come
and
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
followed
him
down
a
narrow
entry
,
at
the
end
of
which
a
key
was
turned
,
and
a
strong
door
was
opened
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
It
admitted
them
into
a
lodge
or
lobby
,
across
which
they
passed
,
and
so
through
another
door
and
a
grating
into
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
always
plodding
on
before
,
turned
round
,
in
his
slow
,
stiff
,
stooping
manner
,
when
they
came
to
the
turnkey
on
duty
,
as
if
to
present
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
The
turnkey
nodded
;
and
the
companion
passed
in
without
being
asked
whom
he
wanted
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
;
and
the
prison
lamps
in
the
yard
,
and
the
candles
in
the
prison
windows
faintly
shining
behind
many
sorts
of
wry
old
curtain
and
blind
,
had
not
the
air
of
making
it
lighter
.
<EOS>
A
few
people
loitered
about
,
but
the
greater
part
of
the
population
was
within
doors
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
taking
the
right
-
hand
side
of
the
yard
,
turned
in
at
the
third
or
fourth
doorway
,
and
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
rather
dark
,
sir
,
but
you
will
not
find
anything
in
the
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
paused
for
a
moment
before
opening
a
door
on
the
second
story
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
turned
the
handle
than
the
visitor
saw
Little
Dorrit
,
and
saw
the
reason
of
her
setting
so
much
store
by
dining
alone
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
brought
the
meat
home
that
she
should
have
eaten
herself
,
and
was
already
warming
it
on
a
gridiron
over
the
fire
for
her
father
,
clad
in
an
old
grey
gown
and
a
black
cap
,
awaiting
his
supper
at
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
A
clean
cloth
was
spread
before
him
,
with
knife
,
fork
,
and
spoon
,
salt
-
cellar
,
pepper
-
box
,
glass
,
and
pewter
ale
-
pot
.
 
<EOS>
Such
zests
as
his
particular
little
phial
of
cayenne
pepper
and
his
pennyworth
of
pickles
in
a
saucer
,
were
not
wanting
.
   
<EOS>
She
started
,
coloured
deeply
,
and
turned
white
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitor
,
more
with
his
eyes
than
by
the
slight
impulsive
motion
of
his
hand
,
entreated
her
to
be
reassured
and
to
trust
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
found
this
gentleman
,
"
said
the
uncle
---
"
Mr
Clennam
,
William
,
son
of
Amy
's
friend
---
at
the
outer
gate
,
wishful
,
as
he
was
going
by
,
of
paying
his
respects
,
but
hesitating
whether
to
come
in
or
not
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
brother
William
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Arthur
,
very
doubtful
what
to
say
,
"
that
my
respect
for
your
daughter
may
explain
and
justify
my
desire
to
be
presented
to
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
"
returned
the
other
,
rising
,
taking
his
cap
off
in
the
flat
of
his
hand
,
and
so
holding
it
,
ready
to
put
on
again
,
"
you
do
me
honour
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
welcome
,
sir
;
"
with
a
low
bow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Frederick
,
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
,
Mr
Clennam
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
black
cap
on
again
as
he
had
taken
it
off
,
and
resumed
his
own
seat
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
wonderful
air
of
benignity
and
patronage
in
his
manner
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
the
ceremonies
with
which
he
received
the
collegians
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
welcome
to
the
Marshalsea
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
welcomed
many
gentlemen
to
these
walls
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
are
aware
<EOS>
---
my
daughter
Amy
may
have
mentioned
that
I
am
the
Father
of
this
place
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
so
I
have
understood
,
"
said
Arthur
,
dashing
at
the
assertion
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
I
dare
say
,
that
my
daughter
Amy
was
born
here
.
 
<EOS>
A
good
girl
,
sir
,
a
dear
girl
,
and
long
a
comfort
and
support
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Amy
,
my
dear
,
put
this
dish
on
;
Mr
Clennam
will
excuse
the
primitive
customs
to
which
we
are
reduced
here
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
a
compliment
to
ask
you
if
you
would
do
me
the
honour
,
sir
,
to
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
returned
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
morsel
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
quite
lost
in
wonder
at
the
manner
of
the
man
,
and
that
the
probability
of
his
daughter
's
having
had
a
reserve
as
to
her
family
history
,
should
be
so
far
out
of
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
She
filled
his
glass
,
put
all
the
little
matters
on
the
table
ready
to
his
hand
,
and
then
sat
beside
him
while
he
ate
his
supper
.
<EOS>
Evidently
in
observance
of
their
nightly
custom
,
she
put
some
bread
before
herself
,
and
touched
his
glass
with
her
lips
;
but
Arthur
saw
she
was
troubled
and
took
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Her
look
at
her
father
,
half
admiring
him
and
proud
of
him
,
half
ashamed
for
him
,
all
devoted
and
loving
,
went
to
his
inmost
heart
.
   
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
condescended
towards
his
brother
as
an
amiable
,
well
-
meaning
man
;
a
private
character
,
who
had
not
arrived
at
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Frederick
,
"
said
he
,
"
you
and
Fanny
sup
at
your
lodgings
to

night
<EOS>
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
with
Fanny
,
Frederick
?
"
<EOS>
"
She
is
walking
with
Tip
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tip
---
as
you
may
know
---
is
my
son
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
a
little
wild
,
and
difficult
to
settle
,
but
his
introduction
to
the
world
was
rather
"
---
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
faint
sigh
,
and
looked
round
the
room
---
"
a
little
adverse
.
 
<EOS>
Your
first
visit
here
,
sir
?

<EOS>
"
my
first

"
You
could
hardly
have
been
here
since
your
boyhood
without
my
knowledge

<EOS>
It
very
seldom
happens
that
anybody

of
any
pretensions

pretensions

comes
here
without

presented

As
many

forty

fifty
in
a
day
have
been
introduced
to
my
brother

said
Frederick
,
faintly
lighting
up
with
a
ray
of
pride
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
assented

On

fine
Sunday
in

it
is
quite
a
Levee

quite
a
Levee

<EOS>
Amy
,
my
dear
,
I
have
been
trying
half
the
day
to
remember
the
name
of
the
gentleman
from
Camberwell
who
was
introduced
to
me
last
Christmas
week
by
that
agreeable
coal
-
merchant
who
was
remanded
for
six
months
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
remember
his
name
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Frederick
,
do
you
remember
his
name
?
"
<EOS>
Frederick
doubted
if
he
had
ever
heard
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
could
doubt
that
Frederick
was
the
last
person
upon
earth
to
put
such
a
question
to
,
with
any
hope
of
information
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
said
his
brother
,
"
the
gentleman
who
did
that
handsome
action
with
so
much
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
Tush
!
 
<EOS>
The
name
has
quite
escaped
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
as
I
have
happened
to
mention
handsome
and
delicate
action
,
you
may
like
,
perhaps
,
to
know
what
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
,
"
said
Arthur
,
withdrawing
his
eyes
from
the
delicate
head
beginning
to
droop
and
the
pale
face
with
a
new
solicitude
stealing
over
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
generous
,
and
shows
so
much
fine
feeling
,
that
it
is
almost
a
duty
to
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
at
the
time
that
I
always
would
mention
it
on
every
suitable
occasion
,
without
regard
to
personal
sensitiveness
.
 
<EOS>
A
---
<EOS>
well
---
a
---
it
's
of
no
use
to
disguise
the
fact
---
you
must
know
,
Mr
Clennam
,
that
it
does
sometimes
occur
that
people
who
come
here
desire
to
offer
some
little
---
Testimonial
---
to
the
Father
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
To
see
her
hand
upon
his
arm
in
mute
entreaty
half
-
repressed
,
and
her
timid
little
shrinking
figure
turning
away
,
was
to
see
a
sad
,
sad
sight
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
,
"
he
went
on
in
a
low
,
soft
voice
,
agitated
,
and
clearing
his
throat
every
now
and
then
;
"
sometimes
---
hem
---
<EOS>
it
takes
one
shape
and
sometimes
another
;
but
it
is
generally
---

---
Money
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
confess
it
,
it
is
too
often
---
hem
---
acceptable
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
that
I
refer
to
,
was
presented
to
me
,
Mr
Clennam
,
in
a
manner
highly
gratifying
to
my
feelings
,
and
conversed
not
only
with
great
politeness
,
but
with
great
---
ahem
---
information
.
"
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
though
he
had
finished
his
supper
,
he
was
nervously
going
about
his
plate
with
his
knife
and
fork
,
as
if
some
of
it
were
still
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
appeared
from
his
conversation
that
he
had
a
garden
,
though
he
was
delicate
of
mentioning
it
at
first
,
as
gardens
are
---
hem
---
are
not
accessible
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
came
out
,
through
my
admiring
a
very
fine
cluster
of
geranium
---
beautiful
cluster
of
geranium
to
be
sure
---
which
he
had
brought
from
his
conservatory
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
taking
notice
of
its
rich
colour
,
he
showed
me
a
piece
of
paper
round
it
,
on
which
was
written
,
"
For
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
"
and
presented
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
---
hem
---
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
particular
request
,
on
taking
leave
,
that
I
would
remove
the
paper
in
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
ha
---
I
did
so
;
and
I
found
that
it
contained
---
ahem
---
two
guineas
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Mr
Clennam
,
I
have
received
---
hem
---
Testimonials
in
many
ways
,
and
of
many
degrees
of
value
,
and
they
have
always
been
---
ha
---
unfortunately
acceptable
;
but
I
never
was
more
pleased
than
with
this
---
ahem
---
this
particular
Testimonial
.

<EOS>
Arthur
was
in
the
act
of
saying
the
little
he
could
say
on
such
a
theme
,
when
a
bell
began
to
ring
,
and
footsteps
approached
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
A
pretty
girl
of
a
far
better
figure
and
much
more
developed
than
Little
Dorrit
,
though
looking
much
younger
in
the
face
when
the
two
were
observed
together
,
stopped
in
the
doorway
on
seeing
a
stranger
;
and
a
young
man
who
was
with
her
,
stopped
too
.

"
Mr
Clennam

Fanny

<EOS>
My
eldest

The
bell
is
a
signal
for
visitors
to
retire
,
and
so
they
have
come
to
say
good
night
;
but
there
is
plenty
of
time

plenty
of
time
.
<EOS>
Girls

Mr
Clennam
will
excuse
any
household
business
you
may
have
together

He
knows
,
I
dare
say
,
that
I
have
but
one
room
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
only
want
my
clean
dress
from
Amy
,

,
"
said
the
second
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"

And
I
my

said

<EOS>
Amy
opened
a
drawer
in
an
old
piece
of
furniture
that
was
a
chest
of
drawers
above
and
a
bedstead
below
,
and
produced
two
little
bundles
,
which
she
handed
to
her
brother
and
sister
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mended
and
made
up
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Clennam
heard
the
sister
ask
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
Amy
answered
"
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
had
risen
now
,
and
took
the
opportunity
of
glancing
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
bare
walls
had
been
coloured
green
,
evidently
by
an
unskilled
hand
,
and
were
poorly
decorated
with
a
few
prints
.
 
<EOS>
The
window
was
curtained
,
and
the
floor
carpeted
;
and
there
were
shelves
and
pegs
,
and
other
such
conveniences
,
that
had
accumulated
in
the
course
of
years
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
close
,
confined
room
,
poorly
furnished
;
and
the
chimney
smoked
to
boot
,
or
the
tin
screen
at
the
top
of
the
fireplace
was
superfluous
;
but
constant
pains
and
care
had
made
it
neat
,
and
even
,
after
its
kind
,
comfortable
.
<EOS>
All
the
while
the
bell
was
ringing
,
and
the
uncle
was
anxious
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Fanny
,
come
,
Fanny
,
"
he
said
,
with
his
ragged
clarionet
case
under
his
arm
;
"
the
lock
,
child
,
the
lock
!
"
   
<EOS>
Fanny
bade
her
father
good
night
,
and
whisked
off
airily
.
 
<EOS>
Tip
had
already
clattered
down
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
the
uncle
,
looking
back
as
he
shuffled
out
after
them
,
"
the
lock
,
sir
,
the
lock
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
had
two
things
to
do
before
he
followed
;
one
,
to
offer
his
testimonial
to
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
without
giving
pain
to
his
child
;
the
other
to
say
something
to
that
child
,
though
it
were
but
a
word
,
in
explanation
of
his
having
come
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
,
"
said
the
Father
,
"
to
see
you
down
-
stairs
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
slipped
out
after
the
rest
,
and
they
were
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
on
any
account
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
allow
me
to
---
"
chink
,
chink
,
chink
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
the
Father
,
"
I
am
deeply
,
deeply
---
<EOS>
"
But
his
visitor
had
shut
up
his
hand
to
stop
the
clinking
,
and
had
gone
down
-
stairs
with
great
speed
.
   
<EOS>
He
saw
no
Little
Dorrit
on
his
way
down
,
or
in
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
two
or
three
stragglers
were
hurrying
to
the
lodge
,
and
he
was
following
,
when
he
caught
sight
of
her
in
the
doorway
of
the
first
house
from
the
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
back
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
forgive
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
speaking
to
you
here
;
pray
forgive
me
for
coming
here
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
I
followed
you
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
that
I
might
endeavour
to
render
you
and
your
family
some
service
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
terms
on
which
I
and
my
mother
are
,
and
may
not
be
surprised
that
I
have
preserved
our
distant
relations
at
her
house
,
lest
I
should
unintentionally
make
her
jealous
,
or
resentful
,
or
do
you
any
injury
in
her
estimation
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
seen
here
,
in
this
short
time
,
has
greatly
increased
my
heartfelt
wish
to
be
a
friend
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
recompense
me
for
much
disappointment
if
I
could
hope
to
gain
your
confidence
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
scared
at
first
,
but
seemed
to
take
courage
while
he
spoke
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
speak
very
earnestly
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
---
<EOS>
but
I
wish
you
had
not
watched
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
understood
the
emotion
with
which
she
said
it
,
to
arise
in
her
father
's
behalf
;
and
he
respected
it
,
and
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Clennam
has
been
of
great
service
to
me
;
I
do
n't
know
what
we
should
have
done
without
the
employment
she
has
given
me
;
I
am
afraid
it
may
not
be
a
good
return
to
become
secret
with
her
;
I
can
say
no
more
to
-
night
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
mean
to
be
kind
to
us
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
thank
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
Let
me
ask
you
one
question
before
I
leave
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
known
my
mother
long
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
two
years
,
sir
,
---
The
bell
has
stopped
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
know
her
first
?
 
<EOS>
Did
she
send
here
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
She
does
not
even
know
that
I
live
here
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
friend
,
father
and
I
---
a
poor
labouring
man
,
but
the
best
of
friends
---
and
I
wrote
out
that
I
wished
to
do
needlework
,
and
gave
his
address
.
<EOS>
And
he
got
what
I
wrote
out
displayed
at
a
few
places
where
it
cost
nothing
,
and
Mrs
Clennam
found
me
that
way
,
and
sent
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
gate
will
be
locked
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
so
tremulous
and
agitated
,
and
he
was
so
moved
by
compassion
for
her
,
and
by
deep
interest
in
her
story
as
it
dawned
upon
him
,
that
he
could
scarcely
tear
himself
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
stoppage
of
the
bell
,
and
the
quiet
in
the
prison
,
were
a
warning
to
depart
;
and
with
a
few
hurried
words
of
kindness
he
left
her
gliding
back
to
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
remained
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
The
inner
gate
was
locked
,
and
the
lodge
closed
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
fruitless
knocking
with
his
hand
,
he
was
standing
there
with
the
disagreeable
conviction
upon
him
that
he
had
got
to
get
through
the
night
,
when
a
voice
accosted
him
from
behind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Caught
,
eh
?
"
said
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
go
home
till
morning
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
you
,
<EOS>
is
it
,
Mr
Clennam
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
voice
was
Tip
's
;
and
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
in
the
prison
-
yard
,
as
it
began
to
rain
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
've
done
it
,
"
observed
Tip
;
"
you
must
be
sharper
than
that
next
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
locked
in
too
,
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
am
!
"
said
Tip
,
sarcastically
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
!
 
<EOS>
But
not
in
your
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
belong
to
the
shop
,
only
my
sister
has
a
theory
that
our
governor
must
never
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
why
,
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
get
any
shelter
?
"
asked
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
had
I
better
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
get
hold
of
Amy
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
"
said
Tip
,
referring
any
difficulty
to
her
as
a
matter
of
course
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
walk
about
all
night
---
it
's
not
much
to
do
---
than
give
that
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
do
that
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
paying
for
a
bed
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
mind
paying
,
they
'll
make
you
up
one
on
the
Snuggery
table
,
under
the
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
come
along
,
I
'll
introduce
you
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
they
passed
down
the
yard
,
Arthur
looked
up
at
the
window
of
the
room
he
had
lately
left
,
where
the
light
was
still
burning
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Tip
,
following
his
glance
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
governor
's
.
<EOS>
She
'll
sit
with
him
for
another
hour
reading
yesterday
's
paper
to
him
,
or
something
of
that
sort
;
and
then
she
'll
come
out
like
a
little
ghost
,
and
vanish
away
without
a
sound
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
governor
sleeps
up
in
the
room
,
and
she
has
a
lodging
at

But

<EOS>
This
brought
them
to
the
tavern
-
establishment
at
the
upper
end
of
the
prison
,
where
the
collegians
had
just
vacated
their
social
evening
club
.
 
<EOS>
The
apartment
on
the
ground
-
floor
in
which
it
was
held
,
was
the
Snuggery
in
question
;
the
presidential
tribune
of
the
chairman
,
the
pewter
-
pots
,
glasses
,
pipes
,
tobacco
-
ashes
,
and
general
flavour
of
members
,
were
still
as
that
convivial
institution
had
left
them
on
its
adjournment
.
 
<EOS>
The
Snuggery
had
two
of
the
qualities
popularly
held
to
be
essential
to
grog
for
ladies
,
in
respect
that
it
was
hot
and
strong
;
but
in
the
third
point
of
analogy
,
requiring
plenty
of
it
,
the
Snuggery
was
defective
;
being
but
a
cooped
-
up
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
The
unaccustomed
visitor
from
outside
,
naturally
assumed
everybody
here
to
be
prisoners
---
landlord
,
waiter
,
barmaid
,
potboy
,
and
all
.
<EOS>
Whether
they
were
or
not
,
did
not
appear
;
but
they
all
had
a
weedy
look
.
 
<EOS>
The
keeper
of
a
chandler
's
shop
in
a
front
parlour
,
who
took
in
gentlemen
boarders
,
lent
his
assistance
in
making
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
tailor
in
his
time
,
and
had
kept
a
phaeton
,
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
He
boasted
that
he
stood
up
litigiously
for
the
interests
of
the
college
;
and
he
had
undefined
and
undefinable
ideas
that
the
marshal
intercepted
a
"
Fund
,
"
which
ought
to
come
to
the
collegians
.
 
<EOS>
He
liked
to
believe
this
,
and
always
impressed
the
shadowy
grievance
on
new
-
comers
and
strangers
;
though
he
could
not
,
for
his
life
,
have
explained
what
Fund
he
meant
,
or
how
the
notion
had
got
rooted
in
his
soul
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
fully
convinced
himself
,
notwithstanding
,
that
his
own
proper
share
of
the
Fund
was
three
and
ninepence
a
week
;
and
that
in
this
amount
he
,
as
an
individual
collegian
,
was
swindled
by
the
marshal
,
regularly
every
Monday
.
<EOS>
Apparently
,
he
helped
to
make
the
bed
,
that
he
might
not
lose
an
opportunity
of
stating
this
case
;
after
which
unloading
of
his
mind
,
and
after
announcing
(
as
it
seemed
he
always
did
,
without
anything
coming
of
it
)
that
he
was
going
to
write
a
letter
to
the
papers
and
show
the
marshal
up
,
he
fell
into
miscellaneous
conversation
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
evident
from
the
general
tone
of
the
whole
party
,
that
they
had
come
to
regard
insolvency
as
the
normal
state
of
mankind
,
and
the
payment
of
debts
as
a
disease
that
occasionally
broke
out
.
<EOS>
In
this
strange
scene
,
and
with
these
strange
spectres
flitting
about
him
,
Arthur
Clennam
looked
on
at
the
preparations
as
if
they
were
part
of
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
Pending
which
,
the
long
-
initiated
Tip
,
with
an
awful
enjoyment
of
the
Snuggery
's
resources
,
pointed
out
the
common
kitchen
fire
maintained
by
subscription
of
collegians
,
the
boiler
for
hot
water
supported
in
like
manner
,
and
other
premises
generally
tending
to
the
deduction
that
the
way
to
be
healthy
,
wealthy
,
and
wise
,
was
to
come
to
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
tables
put
together
in
a
corner
,
were
,
at
length
,
converted
into
a
very
fair
bed
;
and
the
stranger
was
left
to
the
Windsor
chairs
,
the
presidential
tribune
,
the
beery
atmosphere
,
sawdust
,
pipe
-
lights
,
spittoons
and
repose
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
last
item
was
long
,
long
,
long
,
in
linking
itself
to
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
The
novelty
of
the
place
,
the
coming
upon
it
without
preparation
,
the
sense
of
being
locked
up
,
the
remembrance
of
that
room
up
-
stairs
,
of
the
two
brothers
,
and
above
all
of
the
retiring
childish
form
,
and
the
face
in
which
he
now
saw
years
of
insufficient
food
,
if
not
of
want
,
kept
him
waking
and
unhappy
.
   
<EOS>
Speculations
,
too
,
bearing
the
strangest
relations
towards
the
prison
,
but
always
concerning
the
prison
,
ran
like
nightmares
through
his
mind
while
he
lay
awake
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
coffins
were
kept
ready
for
people
who
might
die
there
,
where
they
were
kept
,
how
they
were
kept
,
<EOS>
where
people
who
died
in
the
prison
were
buried
,
how
they
were
taken
out
,
what
forms
were
observed
,
whether
an
implacable
creditor
could
arrest
the
dead
?
 
<EOS>
As
to
escaping
,
what
chances
there
were
of
escape
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
a
prisoner
could
scale
the
walls
with
a
cord
and
grapple
,
how
he
would
descend
upon
the
other
side
?
 
<EOS>
whether
he
could
alight
on
a
housetop
,
steal
down
a
staircase
,
let
himself
out
at
a
door
,
and
get
lost
in
the
crowd
?
<EOS>
As
to
Fire
in
the
prison
,
if
one
were
to
break
out
while
he
lay
there
?
   
<EOS>
And
these
involuntary
starts
of
fancy
were
,
after
all
,
but
the
setting
of
a
picture
in
which
three
people
kept
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
,
with
the
steadfast
look
with
which
he
had
died
,
prophetically
darkened
forth
in
the
portrait
;
his
mother
,
with
her
arm
up
,
warding
off
his
suspicion
;
Little
Dorrit
,
with
her
hand
on
the
degraded
arm
,
and
her
drooping
head
turned
away
.
   
<EOS>
What
if
his
mother
had
an
old
reason
she
well
knew
for
softening
to
this
poor
girl
!
 
<EOS>
What
if
the
prisoner
now
sleeping
quietly
---
Heaven
grant
it
!
<EOS>
---
by
the
light
of
the
great
Day
of
judgment
should
trace
back
his
fall
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
if
any
act
of
hers
and
of
his
father
's
,
should
have
even
remotely
brought
the
grey
heads
of
those
two
brothers
so
low
!
   
<EOS>
A
swift
thought
shot
into
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
long
imprisonment
here
,
and
in
her
own
long
confinement
to
her
room
,
did
his
mother
find
a
balance
to
be
struck
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
admit
that
I
was
accessory
to
that
man
's
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
for
it
in
kind
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
decayed
in
his
prison
:
<EOS>
I
in
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
paid
the
penalty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
When
all
the
other
thoughts
had
faded
out
,
this
one
held
possession
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
fell
asleep
,
she
came
before
him
in
her
wheeled
chair
,
warding
him
off
with
this
justification
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
,
and
sprang
up
causelessly
frightened
,
the
words
were
in
his
ears
,
as
if
her
voice
had
slowly
spoken
them
at
his
pillow
,
to
break
his
rest
:
"
He
withers
away
in
his
prison
;
I
wither
away
in
mine
;
inexorable
justice
is
done
;
what
do
I
owe
on
this
score
!

Little
Mother
 
<EOS>
The
morning
light
was
in
no
hurry
to
climb
the
prison
wall
and
look
in
at
the
Snuggery
windows
;
and
when
it
did
come
,
it
would
have
been
more
welcome
if
it
had
come
alone
,
instead
of
bringing
a
rush
of
rain
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
equinoctial
gales
were
blowing
out
at
sea
,
and
the
impartial
south
-
west
wind
,
in
its
flight
,
would
not
neglect
even
the
narrow
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
While
it
roared
through
the
steeple
of
St
George
's
Church
,
and
twirled
all
the
cowls
in
the
neighbourhood
,
it
made
a
swoop
to
beat
the
Southwark
smoke
into
the
jail
;
and
,
plunging
down
the
chimneys
of
the
few
early
collegians
who
were
yet
lighting
their
fires
,
half
suffocated
them
.
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
would
have
been
little
disposed
to
linger
in
bed
,
though
his
bed
had
been
in
a
more
private
situation
,
and
less
affected
by
the
raking
out
of
yesterday
's
fire
,
the
kindling
of
to
-
day
's
under
the
collegiate
boiler
,
the
filling
of
that
Spartan
vessel
at
the
pump
,
the
sweeping
and
sawdusting
of
the
common
room
,
and
other
such
preparations
.
 
<EOS>
Heartily
glad
to
see
the
morning
,
though
little
rested
by
the
night
,
he
turned
out
as
soon
as
he
could
distinguish
objects
about
him
,
and
paced
the
yard
for
two
heavy
hours
before
the
gate
was
opened
.
   
<EOS>
The
walls
were
so
near
to
one
another
,
and
the
wild
clouds
hurried
over
them
so
fast
,
that
it
gave
him
a
sensation
like
the
beginning
of
sea
-
sickness
to
look
up
at
the
gusty
sky
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
,
carried
aslant
by
flaws
of
wind
,
blackened
that
side
of
the
central
building
which
he
had
visited
last
night
,
but
left
a
narrow
dry
trough
under
the
lee
of
the
wall
,
where
he
walked
up
and
down
among
the
waits
of
straw
and
dust
and
paper
,
the
waste
droppings
of
the
pump
,
and
the
stray
leaves
of
yesterday
's
greens
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
haggard
a
view
of
life
<EOS>
as
a
man
need
look
upon
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
relieved
by
any
glimpse
of
the
little
creature
who
had
brought
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
glided
out
of
her
doorway
and
in
at
that
where
her
father
lived
,
while
his
face
was
turned
from
both
;
but
he
saw
nothing
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
early
for
her
brother
;
to
have
seen
him
once
,
was
to
have
seen
enough
of
him
to
know
that
he
would
be
sluggish
to
leave
whatever
frowsy
bed
he
occupied
at
night
;
so
,
as
Arthur
Clennam
walked
up
and
down
,
waiting
for
the
gate
to
open
,
he
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
future
rather
than
for
present
means
of
pursuing
his
discoveries
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
the
lodge
-
gate
turned
,
and
the
turnkey
,
standing
on
the
step
,
<EOS>
taking
an
early
comb
at
his
hair
,
was
ready
to
let
him
out
.
<EOS>
With
a
joyful
sense
of
release
he
passed
through
the
lodge
,
and
found
himself
again
in
the
little
outer
court
-
yard
where
he
had
spoken
to
the
brother
last
night
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
string
of
people
already
straggling
in
,
whom
it
was
not
difficult
to
identify
as
the
nondescript
messengers
,
go
-
betweens
,
and
errand
-
bearers
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
had
been
lounging
in
the
rain
until
the
gate
should
open
;
others
,
who
had
timed
their
arrival
with
greater
nicety
,
were
coming
up
now
,
and
passing
in
with
damp
whitey
-
brown
paper
bags
from
the
grocers
,
loaves
of
bread
,
lumps
of
butter
,
eggs
,
milk
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
The
shabbiness
of
these
attendants
upon
shabbiness
,
the
poverty
of
these
insolvent
waiters
upon
insolvency
,
was
a
sight
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Such
threadbare
coats
and
trousers
,
such
fusty
gowns
and
shawls
,
such
squashed
hats
and
bonnets
,
such
boots
and
shoes
,
such
umbrellas
and
walking
-
sticks
,
never
were
seen
in
Rag
Fair
.
 
<EOS>
All
of
them
wore
the
cast
-
off
clothes
of
other
men
and
women
,
were
made
up
of
patches
and
pieces
of
other
people
's
individuality
,
and
had
no
sartorial
existence
of
their
own
proper
.
 
<EOS>
Their
walk
was
the
walk
of
a
race
apart
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
peculiar
way
of
doggedly
slinking
round
the
corner
,
as
if
they
were
eternally
going
to
the
pawnbroker
's
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
coughed
,
they
coughed
like
people
accustomed
to
be
forgotten
on
doorsteps
and
in
draughty
passages
,
waiting
for
answers
to
letters
in
faded
ink
,
which
gave
the
recipients
of
those
manuscripts
great
mental
disturbance
and
no
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
eyed
the
stranger
in
passing
,
they
eyed
him
with
borrowing
eyes
---
hungry
,
sharp
,
speculative
as
to
his
softness
if
they
were
accredited
to
him
,
and
the
likelihood
of
his
standing
something
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
Mendicity
on
commission
stooped
in
their
high
shoulders
,
shambled
in
their
unsteady
legs
,
buttoned
and
pinned
and
darned
and
dragged
their
clothes
,
frayed
their
button
-
holes
,
leaked
out
of
their
figures
in
dirty
little
ends
of
tape
,
and
issued
from
their
mouths
in
alcoholic
breathings
.
   
<EOS>
As
these
people
passed
him
standing
still
in
the
court
-
yard
,
and
one
of
them
turned
back
to
inquire
if
he
could
assist
him
with
his
services
,
it
came
into
Arthur
Clennam
's
mind
that
he
would
speak
to
Little
Dorrit
again
before
he
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
recovered
her
first
surprise
,
and
might
feel
easier
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
this
member
of
the
fraternity
(
who
had
two
red
herrings
in
his
hand
,
and
a
loaf
and
a
blacking
brush
under
his
arm
)
,
where
was
the
nearest
place
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee
at
.
 
<EOS>
The
nondescript
replied
in
encouraging
terms
,
and
brought
him
to
a
coffee
-
shop
in
the
street
within
a
stone
's
throw
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
Miss
Dorrit
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
new
client
.
   
<EOS>
The
nondescript
knew
two
Miss
Dorrits
;
one
who
was
born
inside
---
That
was
the
one
!
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
one
?
 
<EOS>
The
nondescript
had
known
her
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
In
regard
of
the
other
Miss
Dorrit
,
the
nondescript
lodged
in
the
same
house
with
herself
and
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
This
changed
the
client
's
half
-
formed
design
of
remaining
at
the
coffee
-
shop
until
the
nondescript
should
bring
him
word
that
Dorrit
had
issued
forth
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
entrusted
the
nondescript
with
a
confidential
message
to
her
,
importing
that
the
visitor
who
had
waited
on
her
father
last
night
,
begged
the
favour
of
a
few
words
with
her
at
her
uncle
's
lodging
;
he
obtained
from
the
same
source
full
directions
to
the
house
,
which
was
very
near
;
dismissed
the
nondescript
gratified
with
half
-
a
-
crown
;
and
having
hastily
refreshed
himself
at
the
coffee
-
shop
,
repaired
with
all
speed
to
the
clarionet
-
player
's
dwelling
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
so
many
lodgers
in
this
house
that
the
doorpost
seemed
to
be
as
full
of
bell
-
handles
as
a
cathedral
organ
is
of
stops
.
<EOS>
Doubtful
which
might
be
the
clarionet
-
stop
,
he
was
considering
the
point
,
when
a
shuttlecock
flew
out
of
the
parlour
window
,
and
alighted
on
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
observed
that
in
the
parlour
window
was
a
blind
with
the
inscription
,
MR
CRIPPLES
's
ACADEMY
;
also
in
another
line
,
EVENING
TUITION
;
and
behind
the
blind
was
a
little
white
-
faced
boy
,
with
a
slice
of
bread
-
and
-
butter
and
a
battledore
.
   
<EOS>
The
window
being
accessible
from
the
footway
,
he
looked
in
over
the
blind
,
returned
the
shuttlecock
,
and
put
his
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dorrit
?
"
said
the
little
white
-
faced
boy
(
Master
Cripples
in
fact
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
Third
bell
and
one
knock
.
<EOS>
"
The
pupils
of
Mr
Cripples
appeared
to
have
been
making
a
copy
-
book
of
the
street
-
door
,
it
was
so
extensively
scribbled
over
in
pencil
.
   
<EOS>
The
frequency
of
the
inscriptions
,
"
Old
Dorrit
,
"
and
"
Dirty
Dick
,
"
in
combination
,
suggested
intentions
of
personality
on
the
part
Of
Mr
Cripples
's
pupils
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
ample
time
to
make
these
observations
before
the
door
was
opened
by
the
poor
old
man
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
very
slowly
remembering
Arthur
,
"
you
were
shut
in
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
to
meet
your
niece
here
presently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
he
,
pondering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Out
of
my
brother
's
way
?
 
<EOS>
True
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
come
up
-
stairs
and
wait
for
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Turning
himself
as
slowly
as
he
turned
in
his
mind
<EOS>
whatever
he
heard
or
said
,
he
led
the
way
up
the
narrow
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
very
close
,
and
had
an
unwholesome
smell
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
staircase
windows
looked
in
at
the
back
windows
of
other
houses
as
unwholesome
as
itself
,
with
poles
and
lines
thrust
out
of
them
,
on
which
unsightly
linen
hung
;
as
if
the
inhabitants
were
angling
for
clothes
,
and
had
had
some
wretched
bites
not
worth
attending
to
.
<EOS>
In
the
back
garret
---
a
sickly
room
,
with
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
in
it
,
so
hastily
and
recently
turned
up
that
the
blankets
were
boiling
over
,
as
it
were
,
and
keeping
the
lid
open
---
a
half
-
finished
breakfast
of
coffee
and
toast
for
two
persons
was
jumbled
down
anyhow
on
a
rickety
table
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
one
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
mumbling
to
himself
,
after
some
consideration
,
that
Fanny
had
run
away
,
went
to
the
next
room
to
fetch
her
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitor
,
observing
that
she
held
the
door
on
the
inside
,
and
that
,
when
the
uncle
tried
to
open
it
,
there
was
a
sharp
adjuration
of
"
Do
n't
,
stupid
!
"
and
an
appearance
of
loose
stocking
and
flannel
,
concluded
that
the
young
lady
was
in
an
undress
.
 
<EOS>
The
uncle
,
without
appearing
to
come
to
any
conclusion
,
shuffled
in
again
,
sat
down
in
his
chair
,
and
began
warming
his
hands
at
the
fire
;
not
that
it
was
cold
,
or
that
he
had
any
waking
idea
whether
it
was
or
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
think
of
my
brother
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
when
he
by
-
and
-
by
discovered
what
he
was
doing
,
left
off
,
reached
over
to
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
took
his
clarionet
case
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
glad
,
"
said
Arthur
,
very
much
at
a
loss
,
for
his
thoughts
were
on
the
brother
before
him
;
"
to
find
him
so
well
and
cheerful
.
"
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
<EOS>
"
muttered
the
old
man
,
"
yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
wondered
what
he
could
possibly
want
with
the
clarionet
case
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
want
it
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
discovered
,
in
due
time
,
that
it
was
not
the
little
paper
of
snuff
(
which
was
also
on
the
chimney
-
piece
)
,
put
it
back
again
,
took
down
the
snuff
instead
,
and
solaced
himself
with
a
pinch
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
feeble
,
spare
,
and
slow
in
his
pinches
as
in
everything
else
,
but
a
certain
little
trickling
of
enjoyment
of
them
played
in
the
poor
worn
nerves
about
the
corners
of
his
eyes
and
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
impressed
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
by
all
that
I
have
seen
of
her
and
thought
of
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
brother
would
have
been
quite
lost
without
Amy
,
"
he
returned
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
all
have
been
lost
without
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
very
good
girl
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
She
does
her
duty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
fancied
that
he
heard
in
these
praises
a
certain
tone
of
custom
,
which
he
had
heard
from
the
father
last
night
with
an
inward
protest
and
feeling
of
antagonism
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
they
stinted
her
praises
,
or
were
insensible
to
what
she
did
for
them
;
but
that
they
were
lazily
habituated
to
her
,
as
they
were
to
all
the
rest
of
their
condition
.
 
<EOS>
He
fancied
that
although
they
had
before
them
,
every
day
,
the
means
of
comparison
between
her
and
one
another
and
themselves
,
they
regarded
her
as
being
in
her
necessary
place
;
as
holding
a
position
towards
them
all
which
belonged
to
her
,
like
her
name
or
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
He
fancied
that
they
viewed
her
,
not
as
having
risen
away
from
the
prison
atmosphere
,
but
as
appertaining
to
it
;
as
being
vaguely
what
they
had
a
right
to
expect
,
and
nothing
more
.
   
<EOS>
Her
uncle
resumed
his
breakfast
,
and
was
munching
toast
sopped
in
coffee
,
oblivious
of
his
guest
,
when
the
third
bell
rang
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
Amy
,
he
said
,
and
went
down
to
let
her
in
;
leaving
the
visitor
with
as
vivid
a
picture
on
his
mind
of
his
begrimed
hands
,
dirt
-
worn
face
,
and
decayed
figure
,
as
if
he
were
still
drooping
in
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
She
came
up
after
him
,
in
the
usual
plain
dress
,
and
with
the
usual
timid
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Her
lips
were
a
little
parted
,
as
if
her
heart
beat
faster
than
usual
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
Amy
,
"
said
her
uncle
,
"
has
been
expecting
you
some
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
took
the
liberty
of
sending
you
a
message
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
received
the
message
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
my
mother
's
this
morning
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
,
for
it
is
past
your
usual
hour
.
"
<EOS>
"
Not
to
-
day
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
wanted
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
Me
to
walk
a
little
way
in
whatever
direction
you
may
be
going
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
then
speak
to
you
as
we
walk
,
both
without
detaining
you
here
,
and
without
intruding
longer
here
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
embarrassed
,
but
said
,
if
he
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
pretence
of
having
mislaid
his
walking
-
stick
,
to
give
her
time
to
set
the
bedstead
right
,
to
answer
her
sister
's
impatient
knock
at
the
wall
,
and
to
say
a
word
softly
to
her
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
found
it
,
and
they
went
down
-
stairs
;
she
first
,
he
following
;
the
uncle
standing
at
the
stair
-
head
,
and
probably
forgetting
them
before
they
had
reached
the
ground
floor
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cripples
's
pupils
,
who
were
by
this
time
coming
to
school
,
desisted
from
their
morning
recreation
of
cuffing
one
another
with
bags
and
books
,
to
stare
with
all
the
eyes
they
had
at
a
stranger
who
had
been
to
see
Dirty
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
They
bore
the
trying
spectacle
in
silence
,
until
the
mysterious
visitor
was
at
a
safe
distance
;
when
they
burst
into
pebbles
and
yells
,
and
likewise
into
reviling
dances
,
and
in
all
respects
buried
the
pipe
of
peace
with
so
many
savage
ceremonies
,
that
,
if
Mr
Cripples
had
been
the
chief
of
the
Cripplewayboo
tribe
with
his
war
-
paint
on
,
they
could
scarcely
have
done
greater
justice
to
their
education
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
homage
,
Mr
Arthur
Clennam
offered
his
arm
to
Little
Dorrit
,
and
Little
Dorrit
took
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
by
the
Iron
Bridge
,
"
said
he
,
"
where
there
is
an
escape
from
the
noise
of
the
street
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
answered
,
if
he
pleased
,
and
presently
ventured
to
hope
that
he
would
"
not
mind
"
Mr
Cripples
's
boys
,
for
she
had
herself
received
her
education
,
such
as
it
was
,
in
Mr
Cripples
's
evening
academy
.
 
<EOS>
He
returned
,
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
,
that
Mr
Cripples
's
boys
were
forgiven
out
of
the
bottom
of
his
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
did
Cripples
unconsciously
become
a
master
of
the
ceremonies
between
them
,
and
bring
them
more
naturally
together
than
Beau
Nash
might
have
done
if
they
had
lived
in
his
golden
days
,
and
he
had
alighted
from
his
coach
and
six
for
the
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
The
morning
remained
squally
,
and
the
streets
were
miserably
muddy
,
but
no
rain
fell
as
they
walked
towards
the
Iron
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
creature
seemed
so
young
in
his
eyes
,
that
there
were
moments
when
he
found
himself
thinking
of
her
,
if
not
speaking
to
her
,
as
if
she
were
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
seemed
as
old
in
her
eyes
as
she
seemed
young
in
his
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
you
were
so
inconvenienced
last
night
,
sir
,
as
to
be
locked
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
unfortunate
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
,
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
a
very
good
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
quickly
;
"
she
believed
there
were
excellent
beds
at
the
coffee
-
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
noticed
that
the
coffee
-
house
was
quite
a
majestic
hotel
to
her
,
and
that
she
treasured
its
reputation
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
is
very
expensive
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
but
MY
father
has
told
me
that
quite
beautiful
dinners
may
be
got
there
.
<EOS>
And
wine
,
"
she
added
timidly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Were
you
ever
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
 
<EOS>
Only
into
the
kitchen
to
fetch
hot
water
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
think
of
growing
up
with
a
kind
of
awe
upon
one
as
to
the
luxuries
of
that
superb
establishment
,
the
Marshalsea
Hotel
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
asked
you
last
night
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
how
you
had
become
acquainted
with
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
her
name
before
she
sent
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
your
father
ever
did
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
met
her
eyes
raised
to
his
with
so
much
wonder
in
them
<EOS>
(
she
was
scared
when
the
encounter
took
place
,
and
shrunk
away
again
)
,
that
he
felt
it
necessary
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
reason
for
asking
,
which
I
can
not
very
well
explain
;
but
you
must
,
on
no
account
,
suppose
it
to
be
of
a
nature
to
cause
you
the
least
alarm
or
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
the
reverse
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
think
that
at
no
time
of
your
father
's
life
was
my
name
of
Clennam
ever
familiar
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
felt
,
from
the
tone
in
which
she
spoke
,
that
she
was
glancing
up
at
him
with
those
parted
lips
;
therefore
he
looked
before
him
,
rather
than
make
her
heart
beat
quicker
still
by
embarrassing
her
afresh
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
they
emerged
upon
the
Iron
Bridge
,
which
was
as
quiet
after
the
roaring
streets
as
though
it
had
been
open
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
blew
roughly
,
the
wet
squalls
came
rattling
past
them
,
skimming
the
pools
on
the
road
and
pavement
,
and
raining
them
down
into
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
The
clouds
raced
on
furiously
in
the
lead
-
Coloured
sky
,
the
smoke
and
mist
raced
after
them
,
the
dark
tide
ran
fierce
and
strong
in
the
same
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
seemed
the
least
,
the
quietest
,
and
weakest
of
Heaven
's
creatures
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
put
you
in
a
coach
,
"
said
Clennam
,
very
nearly
adding
"
my
poor
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
hurriedly
declined
,
saying
that
wet
or
dry
made
little
difference
to
her
;
she
was
used
to
go
about
in
all
weathers
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
it
to
be
so
,
and
was
touched
with
more
pity
;
thinking
of
the
slight
figure
at
his
side
,
making
its
nightly
way
through
the
damp
dark
boisterous
streets
to
such
a
place
of
rest
.
<EOS>
"
You
spoke
so
feelingly
to
me
last
night
,
sir
,
and
I
found
afterwards
that
you
had
been
so
generous
to
my
father
,
that
I
could
not
resist
your
message
,
if
it
was
only
to
thank
you
;
especially
as
I
wished
very
much
to
say
to
you
---
"
she
hesitated
and
trembled
,
and
tears
rose
in
her
eyes
,
but
did
not
fall
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
say
to
me
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
hope
you
will
not
misunderstand
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
judge
him
,
sir
,
as
you
would
judge
others
outside
the
gates
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
there
so
long
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
outside
,
but
I
can
understand
that
he
must
have
grown
different
in
some
things
since
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
thoughts
will
never
be
unjust
or
harsh
towards
him
,
believe
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
prouder
air
,
as
the
misgiving
evidently
crept
upon
her
that
she
might
seem
to
be
abandoning
him
,
"
not
that
he
has
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
for
himself
,
or
that
I
have
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
requires
to
be
understood
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
for
him
that
his
life
may
be
fairly
remembered
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
he
said
was
quite
true
.
 
<EOS>
It
all
happened
just
as
he
related
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
very
much
respected
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
who
comes
in
,
is
glad
to
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
more
courted
than
anyone
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
far
more
thought
of
than
the
Marshal
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
ever
pride
were
innocent
,
it
was
innocent
in
Little
Dorrit
when
she
grew
boastful
of
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
often
said
that
his
manners
are
a
true
gentleman
's
,
and
quite
a
study
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
none
like
them
in
that
place
,
but
he
is
admitted
to
be
superior
to
all
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
quite
as
much
why
they
make
him
presents
,
as
because
they
know
him
to
be
needy
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
being
in
need
,
poor
love
.
 
<EOS>
Who
could
be
in
prison
a
quarter
of
a
century
,
and
be
prosperous
!
"
   
<EOS>
What
affection
in
her
words
,
what
compassion
in
her
repressed
tears
,
what
a
great
soul
of
fidelity
within
her
,
how
true
the
light
that
shed
false
brightness
round
him
!
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
have
found
it
best
to
conceal
where
my
home
is
,
it
is
not
because
I
am
ashamed
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
God
forbid
!
 
<EOS>
Nor
am
I
so
much
ashamed
of
the
place
itself
as
might
be
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
People
are
not
bad
because
they
come
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
known
numbers
of
good
,
persevering
,
honest
people
come
there
through
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
almost
all
kind
-
hearted
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
would
be
ungrateful
indeed
in
me
,
to
forget
that
I
have
had
many
quiet
,
comfortable
hours
there
;
that
I
had
an
excellent
friend
there
when
I
was
quite
a
baby
,
who
was
very
very
fond
of
me
;
that
I
have
been
taught
there
,
and
have
worked
there
,
and
have
slept
soundly
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
almost
cowardly
and
cruel
not
to
have
some
little
attachment
for
it
,
after
all
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
relieved
the
faithful
fulness
of
her
heart
,
and
modestly
said
,
raising
her
eyes
appealingly
to
her
new
friend
's
,
"
I
did
not
mean
to
say
so
much
,
nor
have
I
ever
but
once
spoken
about
this
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
seems
to
set
it
more
right
than
it
was
last
night
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
wished
you
had
not
followed
me
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
it
so
much
now
,
unless
you
should
think
<EOS>
---
indeed
I
do
n't
wish
it
at
all
,
unless
I
should
have
spoken
so
confusedly
,
that
---
that
you
can
scarcely
understand
me
,
which
I
am
afraid
may
be
the
case
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
told
her
with
perfect
truth
that
it
was
not
the
case
;
and
putting
himself
between
her
and
the
sharp
wind
and
rain
,
sheltered
her
as
well
as
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
permitted
now
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
ask
you
a
little
more
concerning
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
Has
he
many
creditors
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
a
great
number
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
detaining
creditors
,
who
keep
him
where
he
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
a
great
number
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
tell
me
---
I
can
get
the
information
,
no
doubt
,
elsewhere
,
if
you
can
not
---
who
is
the
most
influential
of
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
said
,
after
considering
a
little
,
that
she
used
to
hear
long
ago
of
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
as
a
man
of
great
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
commissioner
,
or
a
board
,
or
a
trustee
,
"
or
something
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
lived
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
she
thought
,
or
very
near
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
under
Government
---
high
in
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
have
acquired
,
in
her
infancy
,
some
awful
impression
of
the
might
of
this
formidable
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
of
Grosvenor
Square
,
or
very
near
it
,
and
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
which
quite
crushed
her
when
she
mentioned
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
can
do
no
harm
,
"
thought
Arthur
,
"
if
I
see
this
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
thought
did
not
present
itself
so
quietly
but
that
her
quickness
intercepted
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
shaking
her
head
with
the
mild
despair
of
a
lifetime
.
 
<EOS>
"
Many
people
used
to
think
once
of
getting
my
poor
father
out
,
but
you
do
n't
know
how
hopeless
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
forgot
to
be
shy
at
the
moment
,
in
honestly
warning
him
away
from
the
sunken
wreck
he
had
a
dream
of
raising
;
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
which
assuredly
,
in
association
with
her
patient
face
,
her
fragile
figure
,
her
spare
dress
,
and
the
wind
and
rain
,
did
not
turn
him
from
his
purpose
of
helping
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Even
if
it
could
be
done
,
"
said
she
---
"
and
it
never
can
be
done
now
---
where
could
father
live
,
or
how
could
he
live
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
thought
that
if
such
a
change
could
come
,
it
might
be
anything
but
a
service
to
him
now
.
 
<EOS>
People
might
not
think
so
well
of
him
outside
as
they
do
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
not
be
so
gently
dealt
with
outside
as
he
is
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
not
be
so
fit
himself
for
the
life
outside
as
he
is
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
for
the
first
time
she
could
not
restrain
her
tears
from
falling
;
and
the
little
thin
hands
he
had
watched
when
they
were
so
busy
,
trembled
as
they
clasped
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
new
distress
to
him
even
to
know
that
I
earn
a
little
money
,
and
that
Fanny
earns
a
little
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
so
anxious
about
us
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
feeling
helplessly
shut
up
there
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
good
,
good
father
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
let
the
little
burst
of
feeling
go
by
before
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
soon
gone
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
accustomed
to
think
of
herself
,
or
to
trouble
any
one
with
her
emotions
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
but
glanced
away
at
the
piles
of
city
roofs
and
chimneys
among
which
the
smoke
was
rolling
heavily
,
and
at
the
wilderness
of
masts
on
the
river
,
and
the
wilderness
of
steeples
on
the
shore
,
indistinctly
mixed
together
in
the
stormy
haze
,
when
she
was
again
as
quiet
as
if
she
had
been
plying
her
needle
in
his
mother
's
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
glad
to
have
your
brother
set
at
liberty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
very
,
very
glad
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
will
hope
for
him
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
You
told
me
last
night
of
a
friend
you
had
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
name
was
Plornish
,
Little
Dorrit
said
.
   
<EOS>
And
where
did
Plornish
live
?
 
<EOS>
Plornish
lived
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
"
only
a
plasterer
,
"
Little
Dorrit
said
,
as
a
caution
to
him
not
to
form
high
social
expectations
of
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
He
lived
at
the
last
house
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
and
his
name
was
over
a
little
gateway
.
<EOS>
Arthur
took
down
the
address
and
gave
her
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
now
done
all
he
sought
to
do
for
the
present
,
except
that
he
wished
to
leave
her
with
a
reliance
upon
him
,
and
to
have
something
like
a
promise
from
her
that
she
would
cherish
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
friend
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
putting
up
his
pocketbook
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
take
you
back
---
you
are
going
back
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
 
going
straight
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
take
you
back
,
"
the
word
home
jarred
upon
him
,
"
let
me
ask
you
to
persuade
yourself
that
you
have
another
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
professions
,
and
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
truly
kind
to
me
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
need
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
walked
back
through
the
miserable
muddy
streets
,
and
among
the
poor
,
mean
shops
,
and
were
jostled
by
the
crowds
of
dirty
hucksters
usual
to
a
poor
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
,
by
the
short
way
<EOS>
,
that
was
pleasant
to
any
of
the
five
senses
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
not
a
common
passage
through
common
rain
,
and
mire
,
and
noise
,
to
Clennam
,
having
this
little
,
slender
,
careful
creature
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
How
young
she
seemed
to
him
,
or
how
old
he
to
her
;
or
what
a
secret
either
to
the
other
,
in
that
beginning
of
the
destined
interweaving
of
their
stories
,
matters
not
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
her
having
been
born
and
bred
among
these
scenes
,
and
shrinking
through
them
now
,
familiar
yet
misplaced
;
he
thought
of
her
long
acquaintance
with
the
squalid
needs
of
life
,
and
of
her
innocence
;
of
her
solicitude
for
others
,
and
her
few
years
,
and
her
childish
aspect
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
come
into
the
High
Street
,
where
the
prison
stood
,
when
a
voice
cried
,
"
Little
mother
,
little
mother
!
"
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
stopping
and
looking
back
,
an
excited
figure
of
a
strange
kind
bounced
against
them
(
still
crying
"
little
mother
"
)
,
fell
down
,
and
scattered
the
contents
of
a
large
basket
,
filled
with
potatoes
,
in
the
mud
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Maggy
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
what
a
clumsy
child
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
Maggy
was
not
hurt
,
but
picked
herself
up
immediately
,
and
then
began
to
pick
up
the
potatoes
,
in
which
both
Little
Dorrit
and
Arthur
Clennam
helped
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
picked
up
very
few
potatoes
and
a
great
quantity
of
mud
;
but
they
were
all
recovered
,
and
deposited
in
the
basket
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
then
smeared
her
muddy
face
with
her
shawl
,
and
presenting
it
to
Mr
Clennam
as
a
type
of
purity
,
enabled
him
to
see
what
she
was
like
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
about
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
with
large
bones
,
large
features
,
large
feet
and
hands
,
large
eyes
and
no
hair
.
 
<EOS>
Her
large
eyes
were
limpid
and
almost
colourless
;
they
seemed
to
be
very
little
affected
by
light
,
and
to
stand
unnaturally
still
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
also
that
attentive
listening
expression
in
her
face
,
which
is
seen
in
the
faces
of
the
blind
;
but
she
was
not
blind
,
having
one
tolerably
serviceable
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
not
exceedingly
ugly
,
though
it
was
only
redeemed
from
being
so
by
a
smile
;
a
good
-
humoured
smile
,
and
pleasant
in
itself
,
but
rendered
pitiable
by
being
constantly
there
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
white
cap
,
with
a
quantity
of
opaque
frilling
that
was
always
flapping
about
,
apologised
for
Maggy
's
baldness
,
and
made
it
so
very
difficult
for
her
old
black
bonnet
to
retain
its
place
upon
her
head
,
that
it
held
on
round
her
neck
like
a
gipsy
's
baby
.
 
<EOS>
A
commission
of
haberdashers
could
alone
have
reported
what
the
rest
of
her
poor
dress
was
made
of
,
but
it
had
a
strong
general
resemblance
to
seaweed
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
gigantic
tea
-
leaf
.
<EOS>
Her
shawl
looked
particularly
like
a
tea
-
leaf
after
long
infusion
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
looked
at
Little
Dorrit
with
the
expression
of
one
saying
,
"
May
I
ask
who
this
is
?
"
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
whose
hand
this
Maggy
,
still
calling
her
little
mother
,
had
begun
to
fondle
,
answered
in
words
(
they
were
under
a
gateway
into
which
the
majority
of
the
potatoes
had
rolled
)
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
Maggy
,
sir
.
"
   
"
Maggy
,
sir
,
"
echoed
the
personage
presented
.
 
<EOS>
"
Little
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
grand
-
daughter
---
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Grand
-
daughter
,
"
echoed
Maggy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
my
old
nurse
,
who
has
been
dead
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
,
how
old
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ten
,
mother
,
"
said
Maggy
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
think
how
good
she
is
,
sir
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
with
infinite
tenderness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
SHE
is
,
"
echoed
Maggy
,
transferring
the
pronoun
in
a
most
expressive
way
from
herself
to
her
little
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
how
clever
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
goes
on
errands
as
well
as
any
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
Maggy
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
is
as
trustworthy
as
the
Bank
of
England
.
"
 
<EOS>
Maggy
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
earns
her
own
living
entirely

<EOS>
Entirely
,
sir
!
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
in
a
lower
and
triumphant
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
does
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
her
history
?
"
asked
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Think
of
that
,
Maggy
?
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
taking
her
two
large
hands
and
clapping
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
from
thousands
of
miles
away
,
wanting
to
know
your
history
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
history
?
"
cried
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Little
mother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
means
me
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
rather
confused
;
"
she
is
very
much
attached
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Her
old
grandmother
was
not
so
kind
to
her
as
she
should
have
been
;
was
she
,
Maggy
?
<EOS>
"
Maggy
shook
her
head
,
made
a
drinking
vessel
of
her
clenched
left
hand
,
drank
out
of
it
,
and
said
,
"
Gin
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
beat
an
imaginary
child
,
and
said
,
"
Broom
-
handles
and
pokers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
Maggy
was
ten
years
old
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
watching
her
face
while
she
spoke
,
"
she
had
a
bad
fever
,
sir
,
and
she
has
never
grown
any
older
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ten
years
old
,
"
said
Maggy
,
nodding
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
a
nice
hospital
!
 
<EOS>
So
comfortable
,
was
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
so
nice
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
Ev'nly
place
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
had
never
been
at
peace
before
,
sir
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
turning
towards
Arthur
for
an
instant
and
speaking
low
,
"
and
she
always
runs
off
upon
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
beds
there
is
there
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
lemonades
!
 
<EOS>
Such
oranges
!
 
<EOS>
Such
d'licious
broth
and
wine
!
 
<EOS>
Such
Chicking
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
AIN'T
it
<EOS>
a
delightful
place
to
go
and
stop
at
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
Maggy
stopped
there
as
long
as
she
could
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
in
her
former
tone
of
telling
a
child
's
story
;
the
tone
designed
for
Maggy
's
ear
,
"
and
at
last
,
when
she
could
stop
there
no
longer
,
she
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
because
she
was
never
to
be
more
than
ten
years
old
,
however
long
she
lived
---
"
   
"
However
long
she
lived
,
"
echoed
Maggy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
because
she
was
very
weak
;
indeed
was
so
weak
that
when
she
began
to
laugh
she
could
n't
stop
herself
---
which
was
a
great
pity
---
"
   
<EOS>
(
Maggy
mighty
grave
of
a
sudden
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Her
grandmother
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
her
,
and
for
some
years
was
very
unkind
to
her
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
in
course
of
time
,
Maggy
began
to
take
pains
to
improve
herself
,
and
to
be
very
attentive
and
very
industrious
;
and
by
degrees
was
allowed
to
come
in
and
out
as
often
as
she
liked
,
and
got
enough
to
do
to
support
herself
,
and
does
support
herself
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
clapping
the
two
great
hands
together
again
,
"
is
Maggy
's
history
,
as
Maggy
knows
!
"
   
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
But
Arthur
would
have
known
what
was
wanting
to
its
completeness
,
though
he
had
never
heard
of
the
words
Little
mother
;
though
he
had
never
seen
the
fondling
of
the
small
spare
hand
;
though
he
had
had
no
sight
for
the
tears
now
standing
in
the
colourless
eyes
;
though
he
had
had
no
hearing
for
the
sob
that
checked
the
clumsy
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
The
dirty
gateway
with
the
wind
and
rain
whistling
through
it
,
and
the
basket
of
muddy
potatoes
waiting
to
be
spilt
again
or
taken
up
,
never
seemed
the
common
hole
it
really
was
,
when
he
looked
back
to
it
by
these
lights
.
 
<EOS>
Never
,
never
!
   
<EOS>
They
were
very
near
the
end
of
their
walk
,
and
they
now
came
out
of
the
gateway
to
finish
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
would
serve
Maggy
but
that
they
must
stop
at
a
grocer
's
window
,
short
of
their
destination
,
for
her
to
show
her
learning
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
read
after
a
sort
;
and
picked
out
the
fat
figures
in
the
tickets
of
prices
,
for
the
most
part
correctly
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
stumbled
,
with
a
large
balance
of
success
against
her
failures
,
through
various
philanthropic
recommendations
to
Try
our
Mixture
,
Try
our
Family
Black
,
Try
our
Orange
-
flavoured
Pekoe
,
challenging
competition
at
the
head
of
Flowery
Teas
;
and
various
cautions
to
the
public
against
spurious
establishments
and
adulterated
articles
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
saw
how
pleasure
brought
a
rosy
tint
into
Little
Dorrit
's
face
when
Maggy
made
a
hit
,
he
felt
that
he
could
have
stood
there
making
a
library
of
the
grocer
's
window
until
the
rain
and
wind
were
tired
.
   
<EOS>
The
court
-
yard
received
them
at
last
,
and
there
he
said
goodbye
to
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Little
as
she
had
always
looked
,
she
looked
less
than
ever
when
he
saw
her
going
into
the
Marshalsea
lodge
passage
,
<EOS>
the
little
mother
attended
by
her
big
child
.
<EOS>
The
cage
door
opened
,
and
when
the
small
bird
,
reared
in
captivity
,
had
tamely
fluttered
in
,
he
saw
it
shut
again
;
and
then
he
came
away
.

<EOS>
Containing
the
whole
Science
of
Government
 
<EOS>
The
Circumlocution
Office
was
(
as
everybody
knows
without
being
told
)
the
most
important
Department
under
Government
.
 
<EOS>
No
public
business
of
any
kind
could
possibly
be
done
at
any
time
without
the
acquiescence
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
Its
finger
was
in
the
largest
public
pie
,
and
in
the
smallest
public
tart
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
equally
impossible
to
do
the
plainest
right
and
to
undo
the
plainest
wrong
without
the
express
authority
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
If
another
Gunpowder
Plot
had
been
discovered
half
an
hour
before
the
lighting
of
the
match
,
nobody
would
have
been
justified
in
saving
the
parliament
until
there
had
been
half
a
score
of
boards
,
half
a
bushel
of
minutes
,
several
sacks
of
official
memoranda
,
and
a
family
-
vault
full
of
ungrammatical
correspondence
,
on
the
part
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
   
<EOS>
This
glorious
establishment
had
been
early
in
the
field
,
when
the
one
sublime
principle
involving
the
difficult
art
of
governing
a
country
,
was
first
distinctly
revealed
to
statesmen
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
foremost
to
study
that
bright
revelation
and
to
carry
its
shining
influence
through
the
whole
of
the
official
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
was
required
to
be
done
,
the
Circumlocution
Office
was
beforehand
with
all
the
public
departments
in
the
art
of
perceiving
---
<EOS>
HOW
NOT
TO
DO
IT
.
   
<EOS>
Through
this
delicate
perception
,
through
the
tact
with
which
it
invariably
seized
it
,
and
through
the
genius
with
which
it
always
acted
on
it
,
the
Circumlocution
Office
had
risen
to
overtop
all
the
public
departments
;
and
the
public
condition
had
risen
to
be
---
what
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
How
not
to
do
it
was
the
great
study
and
object
of
all
public
departments
and
professional
politicians
all
round
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
every
new
premier
and
every
new
government
,
coming
in
because
they
had
upheld
a
certain
thing
as
necessary
to
be
done
,
were
no
sooner
come
in
than
they
applied
their
utmost
faculties
to
discovering
How
not
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
from
the
moment
when
a
general
election
was
over
,
every
returned
man
who
had
been
raving
on
hustings
because
it
had
n't
been
done
,
and
who
had
been
asking
the
friends
of
the
honourable
gentleman
in
the
opposite
interest
on
pain
of
impeachment
to
tell
him
why
it
had
n't
been
done
,
and
who
had
been
asserting
that
it
must
be
done
,
and
who
had
been
pledging
himself
that
it
should
be
done
,
began
to
devise
,
How
it
was
not
to
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
the
debates
of
both
Houses
of
Parliament
the
whole
session
through
,
uniformly
tended
to
the
protracted
deliberation
,
How
not
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
the
royal
speech
at
the
opening
of
such
session
virtually
said
,
My
lords
and
gentlemen
,
you
have
a
considerable
stroke
of
work
to
do
,
and
you
will
please
to
retire
to
your
respective
chambers
,
and
discuss
,
How
not
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
the
royal
speech
,
at
the
close
of
such
session
,
virtually
said
,
My
lords
and
gentlemen
,
you
have
through
several
laborious
months
been
considering
with
great
loyalty
and
patriotism
,
How
not
to
do
it
,
and
you
have
found
out
;
and
with
the
blessing
of
Providence
upon
the
harvest
(
natural
,
not
political
)
,
I
now
dismiss
you
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
is
true
,
but
the
Circumlocution
Office
went
beyond
it
.
   
<EOS>
Because
the
Circumlocution
Office
went
on
mechanically
,
every
day
,
keeping
this
wonderful
,
all
-
sufficient
wheel
of
statesmanship
,
How
not
to
do
it
,
in
motion
.
 
<EOS>
Because
the
Circumlocution
Office
was
down
upon
any
ill
-
advised
public
servant
who
was
going
to
do
it
,
or
who
appeared
to
be
by
any
surprising
accident
in
remote
danger
of
doing
it
,
with
a
minute
,
and
a
memorandum
,
and
a
letter
of
instructions
that
extinguished
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
this
spirit
of
national
efficiency
in
the
Circumlocution
Office
that
had
gradually
led
to
its
having
something
to
do
with
everything
.
 
<EOS>
Mechanicians
,
natural
philosophers
,
soldiers
,
sailors
,
petitioners
,
memorialists
,
people
with
grievances
,
people
who
wanted
to
prevent
grievances
,
people
who
wanted
to
redress
grievances
,
jobbing
people
,
jobbed
people
,
people
who
could
n't
get
rewarded
for
merit
,
and
people
who
could
n't
get
punished
for
demerit
,
were
all
indiscriminately
tucked
up
under
the
foolscap
paper
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
   
<EOS>
Numbers
of
people
were
lost
in
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
<EOS>
Unfortunates
with
wrongs
,
or
with
projects
for
the
general
welfare
(
and
they
had
better
have
had
wrongs
at
first
,
than
have
taken
that
bitter
English
recipe
for
certainly
getting
them
)
,
who
in
slow
lapse
of
time
and
agony
had
passed
safely
through
other
public
departments
;
who
,
according
to
rule
,
had
been
bullied
in
this
,
over
-
reached
by
that
,
and
evaded
by
the
other
;
got
referred
at
last
to
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
and
never
reappeared
in
the
light
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
Boards
sat
upon
them
,
secretaries
minuted
upon
them
,
commissioners
gabbled
about
them
,
clerks
registered
,
entered
,
checked
,
and
ticked
them
off
,
and
they
melted
away
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
all
the
business
of
the
country
went
through
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
except
the
business
that
never
came
out
of
it
;
and
its
name
was
Legion
.
   
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
angry
spirits
attacked
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
parliamentary
questions
were
asked
about
it
,
and
even
parliamentary
motions
made
or
threatened
about
it
by
demagogues
so
low
and
ignorant
as
to
hold
that
the
real
recipe
of
government
was
,
How
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
would
the
noble
lord
,
or
right
honourable
gentleman
,
in
whose
department
it
was
to
defend
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
put
an
orange
in
his
pocket
,
and
make
a
regular
field
-
day
of
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Then
would
he
come
down
to
that
house
with
a
slap
upon
the
table
,
and
meet
the
honourable
gentleman
foot
to
foot
.
<EOS>
Then
would
he
be
there
to
tell
that
honourable
gentleman
that
the
Circumlocution
Office
not
only
was
blameless
in
this
matter
,
but
was
commendable
in
this
matter
,
was
extollable
to
the
skies
in
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Then
would
he
be
there
to
tell
that
honourable
gentleman
that
,
although
the
Circumlocution
Office
was
invariably
right
and
wholly
right
,
it
never
was
so
right
as
in
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Then
would
he
be
there
to
tell
that
honourable
gentleman
that
it
would
have
been
more
to
his
honour
,
more
to
his
credit
,
more
to
his
good
taste
,
more
to
his
good
sense
,
more
to
half
the
dictionary
of
commonplaces
,
if
he
had
left
the
Circumlocution
Office
alone
,
and
never
approached
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Then
would
he
keep
one
eye
upon
a
coach
or
crammer
from
the
Circumlocution
Office
sitting
below
the
bar
,
and
smash
the
honourable
gentleman
with
the
Circumlocution
Office
account
of
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
And
although
one
of
two
things
always
happened
;
namely
,
either
that
the
Circumlocution
Office
had
nothing
to
say
and
said
it
,
or
that
it
had
something
to
say
of
which
the
noble
lord
,
or
right
honourable
gentleman
,
blundered
one
half
and
forgot
the
other
;
the
Circumlocution
Office
was
always
voted
immaculate
by
an
accommodating
majority
.
   
<EOS>
Such
a
nursery
of
statesmen
had
the
Department
become
in
virtue
of
a
long
career
of
this
nature
,
that
several
solemn
lords
had
attained
the
reputation
of
being
quite
unearthly
prodigies
of
business
,
solely
from
having
practised
,
How
not
to
do
it
,
as
the
head
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
minor
priests
and
acolytes
of
that
temple
,
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
they
stood
divided
into
two
classes
,
and
,
down
to
the
junior
messenger
,
either
believed
in
the
Circumlocution
Office
as
a
heaven
-
born
institution
that
had
an
absolute
right
to
do
whatever
it
liked
;
or
took
refuge
in
total
infidelity
,
and
considered
it
a
flagrant
nuisance
.
   
<EOS>
The
Barnacle
family
had
for
some
time
helped
to
administer
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tite
Barnacle
Branch
,
indeed
,
considered
themselves
in
a
general
way
as
having
vested
rights
in
that
direction
,
and
took
it
ill
if
any
other
family
had
much
to
say
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
Barnacles
were
a
very
high
family
,
and
a
very
large
family
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
dispersed
all
over
the
public
offices
,
and
held
all
sorts
of
public
places
.
 
<EOS>
Either
the
nation
was
under
a
load
of
obligation
to
the
Barnacles
,
or
the
Barnacles
were
under
a
load
of
obligation
to
the
nation
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
quite
unanimously
settled
which
;
the
Barnacles
having
their
opinion
,
the
nation
theirs
.
   
<EOS>
The
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
who
at
the
period
now
in
question
usually
coached
or
crammed
the
statesman
at
the
head
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
when
that
noble
or
right
honourable
individual
sat
a
little
uneasily
in
his
saddle
by
reason
of
some
vagabond
making
a
tilt
at
him
in
a
newspaper
,
was
more
flush
of
blood
than
money
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
Barnacle
he
had
his
place
,
which
was
a
snug
thing
enough
;
and
as
a
Barnacle
he
had
of
course
put
in
his
son
Barnacle
Junior
in
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
intermarried
with
a
branch
of
the
Stiltstalkings
,
who
were
also
better
endowed
in
a
sanguineous
point
of
view
than
with
real
or
personal
property
,
and
of
this
marriage
there
had
been
issue
,
Barnacle
junior
and
three
young
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
What
with
the
patrician
requirements
of
Barnacle
junior
,
the
three
young
ladies
,
Mrs
Tite
Barnacle
nee
Stiltstalking
,
and
himself
,
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
found
the
intervals
between
quarter
day
and
quarter
day
rather
longer
than
he
could
have
desired
;
a
circumstance
which
he
always
attributed
to
the
country
's
parsimony
.
<EOS>
For
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
,
Mr
Arthur
Clennam
made
his
fifth
inquiry
one
day
at
the
Circumlocution
Office
;
having
on
previous
occasions
awaited
that
gentleman
successively
in
a
hall
,
a
glass
case
,
a
waiting
room
,
and
a
fire
-
proof
passage
where
the
Department
seemed
to
keep
its
wind
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
Mr
Barnacle
was
not
engaged
,
as
he
had
been
before
,
with
the
noble
prodigy
at
the
head
of
the
Department
;
but
was
absent
.
 
<EOS>
Barnacle
Junior
,
however
,
was
announced
as
a
lesser
star
,
yet
visible
above
the
office
horizon
.
   
<EOS>
With
Barnacle
junior
,
he
signified
his
desire
to
confer
;
and
found
that
young
gentleman
singeing
the
calves
of
his
legs
at
the
parental
fire
,
and
supporting
his
spine
against
the
mantel
-
shelf
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
comfortable
room
,
handsomely
furnished
in
the
higher
official
manner
;
an
presenting
stately
suggestions
of
the
absent
Barnacle
,
in
the
thick
carpet
,
the
leather
-
covered
desk
to
sit
at
,
the
leather
-
covered
desk
to
stand
at
,
the
formidable
easy
-
chair
and
hearth
-
rug
,
the
interposed
screen
,
the
torn
-
up
papers
,
the
dispatch
-
boxes
with
little
labels
sticking
out
of
them
,
like
medicine
bottles
or
dead
game
,
the
pervading
smell
of
leather
and
mahogany
,
and
a
general
bamboozling
air
of
How
not
to
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
present
Barnacle
,
holding
Mr
Clennam
's
card
in
his
hand
,
had
a
youthful
aspect
,
and
the
fluffiest
little
whisker
,
perhaps
,
that
ever
was
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
downy
tip
was
on
his
callow
chin
,
that
he
seemed
half
fledged
like
a
young
bird
;
and
a
compassionate
observer
might
have
urged
that
,
if
he
had
not
singed
the
calves
of
his
legs
,
he
would
have
died
of
cold
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
superior
eye
-
glass
dangling
round
his
neck
,
but
unfortunately
had
such
flat
orbits
to
his
eyes
and
such
limp
little
eyelids
that
it
would
n't
stick
in
when
he
put
it
up
,
but
kept
tumbling
out
against
his
waistcoat
buttons
with
a
click
that
discomposed
him
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

I
say
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here

<EOS>
My

Barnacle
Junior

You

Barnacle
Junior

<EOS>
(
By
this
time
he
had
found
the
eye

glass

put
it
up
again

"
No

Arthur

felt
it
useless

"

said
Barnacle

,
taking
heed

his

anything

Tonnage

or
that
sort
of
thing

<EOS>
(
Pausing
for
a
reply
,
he
opened
his
right
eye
with
his
hand
,
and
stuck
his
glass
in
it
,
in
that
inflammatory
manner
that
his
eye
began
watering
dreadfully
.

<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Arthur
,
"
it
is
nothing
about

<EOS>
"
Then
look
here

<EOS>
Is
it
private
business

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
am
not

It
relates
to
a

<EOS>
"

Twenty

"
   
<EOS>
(
The
misguided
young
Barnacle
evidently
going
blind
on
his
eye
-
glass
side
,
but
ashamed
to
make
any
further
alteration
in
his
painful
arrangements
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you

<EOS>
I
will
call
there
now
.
 
<EOS>
Good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Young
Barnacle
seemed
discomfited
at
this
,
as
not
having
at
all
expected
him
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
sure
,
"
said
Barnacle
junior
,
calling
after
him
when
he
got
to
the
door
,
unwilling
wholly
to
relinquish
the
bright
business
idea
he
had
conceived
;
"
that
it
's
nothing
about
Tonnage
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
such
assurance
,
and
rather
wondering
what
might
have
taken
place
if
it
HAD
been
anything
about
tonnage
,
Mr
Clennam
withdrew
to
pursue
his
inquiries
.
   
<EOS>
Mews
Street
,
Grosvenor
Square
,
was
not
absolutely
Grosvenor
Square
itself
,
but
it
was
very
near
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
hideous
little
street
of
dead
wall
,
stables
,
and
dunghills
,
with
lofts
over
coach
-
houses
inhabited
by
coachmen
's
families
,
who
had
a
passion
for
drying
clothes
and
decorating
their
window
-
sills
with
miniature
turnpike
-
gates
.
<EOS>
The
principal
chimney
-
sweep
of
that
fashionable
quarter
lived
at
the
blind
end
of
Mews
Street
;
and
the
same
corner
contained
an
establishment
much
frequented
about
early
morning
and
twilight
for
the
purchase
of
wine
-
bottles
and
kitchen
-
stuff
.
<EOS>
Punch
's
shows
used
to
lean
against
the
dead
wall
in
Mews
Street
,
while
their
proprietors
were
dining
elsewhere
;
and
the
dogs
of
the
neighbourhood
made
appointments
to
meet
in
the
same
locality
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
there
were
two
or
three
small
airless
houses
at
the
entrance
end
of
Mews
Street
,
which
went
at
enormous
rents
on
account
of
their
being
abject
hangers
-
on
to
a
fashionable
situation
;
and
whenever
one
of
these
fearful
little
coops
was
to
be
let
(
which
seldom
happened
,
for
they
were
in
great
request
)
<EOS>
,
the
house
agent
advertised
it
as
a
gentlemanly
residence
in
the
most
aristocratic
part
of
town
,
inhabited
solely
by
the
elite
of
the
beau
monde
.
   
<EOS>
If
a
gentlemanly
residence
coming
strictly
within
this
narrow
margin
had
not
been
essential
to
the
blood
of
the
Barnacles
,
this
particular
branch
would
have
had
a
pretty
wide
selection
among
,
let
us
say
,
ten
thousand
houses
,
offering
fifty
times
the
accommodation
for
a
third
of
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
Mr
Barnacle
,
finding
his
gentlemanly
residence
extremely
inconvenient
and
extremely
dear
,
always
laid
it
,
as
a
public
servant
,
at
the
door
of
the
country
,
and
adduced
it
as
another
instance
of
the
country
's
parsimony
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
came
to
a
squeezed
house
,
with
a
ramshackle
bowed
front
,
little
dingy
windows
,
and
a
little
dark
area
like
a
damp
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
which
he
found
to
be
number
twenty
-
four
,
Mews
Street
,
Grosvenor
Square
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
sense
of
smell
the
house
was
like
a
sort
of
bottle
filled
with
a
strong
distillation
of
Mews
;
and
when
the
footman
opened
the
door
,
he
seemed
to
take
the
stopper
out
.
   
<EOS>
The
footman
was
to
the
Grosvenor
Square
footmen
,
what
the
house
was
to
the
Grosvenor
Square
houses
.
 
<EOS>
Admirable
in
his
way
,
his
way
was
a
back
and
a
bye
way
.
 
<EOS>
His
gorgeousness
was
not
unmixed
with
dirt
;
and
both
in
complexion
and
consistency
he
had
suffered
from
the
closeness
of
his
pantry
.
 
<EOS>
A
sallow
flabbiness
was
upon
him
when
he
took
the
stopper
out
,
and
presented
the
bottle
to
Mr
Clennam
's
nose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
so
good
as
to
give
that
card
to
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
,
and
to
say
that
I
have
just
now
seen
the
younger
Mr
Barnacle
,
who
recommended
me
to
call
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
footman
(
who
had
as
many
large
buttons
with
the
Barnacle
crest
upon
them
on
the
flaps
of
his
pockets
,
as
if
he
were
the
family
strong
box
,
and
carried
the
plate
and
jewels
about
with
him
buttoned
up
)
pondered
over
the
card
a
little
;
then
said
,
"
Walk
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
required
some
judgment
to
do
it
without
butting
the
inner
hall
-
door
open
,
and
in
the
consequent
mental
confusion
and
physical
darkness
slipping
down
the
kitchen
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitor
,
however
,
brought
himself
up
safely
on
the
door
-
mat
.
   
<EOS>
Still
the
footman
said
"
Walk
in
,
"
so
the
visitor
followed
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
inner
hall
-
door
,
another
bottle
seemed
to
be
presented
and
another
stopper
taken
out
.
 
<EOS>
This
second
vial
appeared
to
be
filled
with
concentrated
provisions
and
extract
of
Sink
from
the
pantry
.
<EOS>
After
a
skirmish
in
the
narrow
passage
,
occasioned
by
the
footman
's
opening
the
door
of
the
dismal
dining
-
room
with
confidence
,
finding
some
one
there
with
consternation
,
and
backing
on
the
visitor
with
disorder
,
the
visitor
was
shut
up
,
pending
his
announcement
,
in
a
close
back
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
had
an
opportunity
of
refreshing
himself
with
both
the
bottles
at
once
,
looking
out
at
a
low
blinding
wall
three
feet
off
,
and
speculating
on
the
number
of
Barnacle
families
within
the
bills
of
mortality
who
lived
in
such
hutches
of
their
own
free
flunkey
choice
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barnacle
would
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Would
he
walk
up
-
stairs
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
,
and
he
did
;
and
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
with
his
leg
on
a
rest
,
he
found
Mr
Barnacle
himself
,
the
express
image
and
presentment
of
How
not
to
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barnacle
dated
from
a
better
time
,
when
the
country
was
not
so
parsimonious
and
the
Circumlocution
Office
was
not
so
badgered
.
 
<EOS>
He
wound
and
wound
folds
of
white
cravat
<EOS>
round
his
neck
,
as
he
wound
and
wound
folds
of
tape
and
paper
<EOS>
round
the
neck
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
His
wristbands
and
collar
were
oppressive
;
his
voice
and
manner
were
oppressive
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
large
watch
-
chain
and
bunch
of
seals
,
a
coat
buttoned
up
to
inconvenience
,
a
waistcoat
buttoned
up
to
inconvenience
,
an
unwrinkled
pair
of
trousers
,
a
stiff
pair
of
boots
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
altogether
splendid
,
massive
,
overpowering
,
and
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
have
been
sitting
for
his
portrait
to
Sir
Thomas
Lawrence
all
the
days
of
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
"

Clennam

"
said
Mr
Barnacle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
became
seated
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
called
on
me
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Barnacle
,
"
at
the
Circumlocution

giving
it
the
air

a
word

five

twenty

Mr

solemnly
bent
his

as
who
should
say
,
"
I
do
not
deny
that
it
is
a
liberty
;
proceed
to
take
another
liberty
,
and
let
me

"
   
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
observe
that
I
have
been
for
some
years
in
China

am
quite
a
stranger
at

and
have
no
personal
motive
or
interest

the
inquiry
I
am
about
to
make

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barnacle
tapped
his
fingers
on
the
table
,
and
,
as
if
he
were
now
sitting
for
his
portrait
to
a
new
and
strange
artist
,
appeared
to
say
to
his
visitor
,
"
If
you
will
be
good
enough
to
take
me
with
my
present
lofty
expression
,
I
shall
feel
obliged

<EOS>
"
I
have
found
a

Marshalsea
Prison

It
being
one

principles

Office
never

on
any
account
whatever

to
give

On

,
or
as
private
individual
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Circumlocution
Department
,
sir
,
"
Mr
Barnacle
replied
,
"
may
have
possibly
recommended
---
possibly
---
I
can
not
say
---
that
some
public
claim
against
the
insolvent
estate
of
a
firm
or
copartnership
to
which
this
person
may
have
belonged
,
should
be
enforced
.
 
<EOS>
The
question
may
have
been
,
in
the
course
of
official
business
,
referred
to
the
Circumlocution
Department
for
its
consideration
.
<EOS>
The
Department
may
have
either
originated
,
or
confirmed
,
a
Minute
making
that
recommendation
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assume
this
to
be
the
case
,
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Circumlocution
Department
,
"
said
Mr
Barnacle
,
"
is
not
responsible
for
any
gentleman
's
assumptions
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
inquire
how
I
can
obtain
official
information
as
to
the
real
state
of
the
case
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
competent
,
"
said
Mr
Barnacle
,
"
to
any
member
of
the
---
Public
,
"
mentioning
that
obscure
body
with
reluctance
,
as
his
natural
enemy
,
"
to
memorialise
the
Circumlocution
Department
.
 
<EOS>
Such
formalities
as
are
required
to
be
observed
in
so
doing
,
may
be
known
on
application
to
the
proper
branch
of
that
Department
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
is
the
proper
branch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
refer
you
,
"
returned
Mr
Barnacle
,
ringing
the
bell
,
"
to
the
Department
itself
for
a
formal
answer
to
that
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Excuse
my
mentioning
---
"
   
"
The
Department
is
accessible
to
the
---
Public
,
"
Mr
Barnacle
was
always
checked
a
little
by
that
word
of
impertinent
signification
,
"
if
the
---
Public
approaches
it
according
to
the
official
forms
;
if
the
---
Public
does
not
approach
it
according
to
the
official
forms
,
the
---
Public
has
itself
to
blame
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barnacle
made
him
a
severe
bow
,
as
a
wounded
man
of
family
,
a
wounded
man
of
place
,
and
a
wounded
man
of
a
gentlemanly
residence
,
all
rolled
into
one
;
and
he
made
Mr
Barnacle
a
bow
,
and
was
shut
out
into
Mews
Street
by
the
flabby
footman
.
   
<EOS>
Having
got
to
this
pass
,
he
resolved
as
an
exercise
in
perseverance
,
to
betake
himself
again
to
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
and
try
what
satisfaction
he
could
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
went
back
to
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
and
once
more
sent
up
his
card
to
Barnacle
junior
by
a
messenger
who
took
it
very
ill
indeed
that
he
should
come
back
again
,
and
who
was
eating
mashed
potatoes
and
gravy
behind
a
partition
by
the
hall
fire
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
readmitted
to
the
presence
of
Barnacle
junior
,
and
found
that
young
gentleman
singeing
his
knees
now
,
and
gaping
his
weary
way
on
to
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
stick
to
us
in
a
devil
of
a
manner
,
"
Said
Barnacle
junior
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
---
"
   
"
Look
here
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
you
must
n't
come
into
the
place
saying
you
want
to
know
,
you
know
,
"
remonstrated
Barnacle
junior
,
turning
about
and
putting
up
the
eye
-
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
,
"
said
Arthur
Clennam
,
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
persistence
in
one
short
form
of
words
,
"
the
precise
nature
of
the
claim
of
the
Crown
against
a
prisoner
for
debt
,
named
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
really
are
going
it
at
a
great
pace
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Egad
,
you
have
n't
got
an
appointment
,
"
said
Barnacle
junior
,
as
if
the
thing
were
growing
serious
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
,
"
said
Arthur
,
and
repeated
his
case
.
   
<EOS>
Barnacle
junior
stared
at
him
until
his
eye
-
glass
fell
out
,
and
then
put
it
in
again
and
stared
at
him
until
it
fell
out
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
right
to
come
this
sort
of
move
,
"
he
then
observed
with
the
greatest
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
here
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
You
told
me
you
did
n't
know
whether
it
was
public
business
or
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
ascertained
that
it
is
public
business
,
"
returned
the
suitor
,
"
and
I
want
to
know
"
---
and
again
repeated
his
monotonous
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
Its
effect
upon
young
Barnacle
was
to
make
him
repeat
in
a
defenceless
way
,
"
Look
here
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
SOUL
you
must
n't
come
into
the
place
saying
you
want
to
know
,
you
know
!
"
<EOS>
The
effect
of
that
upon
Arthur
Clennam
was
to
make
him
repeat
his
inquiry
in
exactly
the
same
words
and
tone
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
effect
of
that
upon
young
Barnacle
was
to
make
him
a
wonderful
spectacle
of
failure
and
helplessness
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
tell
you
what
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
try
the
Secretarial
Department
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
sidling
to
the
bell
and
ringing
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jenkinson
,
"
to
the
mashed
potatoes
messenger
,
"
Mr
Wobbler
!
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
,
who
now
felt
that
he
had
devoted
himself
to
the
storming
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
and
must
go
through
with
it
,
accompanied
the
messenger
to
another
floor
of
the
building
,
where
that
functionary
pointed
out
Mr
Wobbler
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
entered
that
apartment
,
and
found
two
gentlemen
sitting
face
to
face
at
a
large
and
easy
desk
,
one
of
whom
was
polishing
a
gun
-
barrel
on
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
while
the
other
was
spreading
marmalade
on
bread
with
a
paper
-
knife
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Wobbler
?
"
inquired
the
suitor
.
   
<EOS>
Both
gentlemen
glanced
at
him
,
and
seemed
surprised
at
his
assurance
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
he
went
,
"
said
the
gentleman
with
the
gun
-
barrel
,
who
was
an
extremely
deliberate
speaker
,
"
down
to
his
cousin
's
place
,
and
took
the
Dog
with
him
by
rail
.
 
<EOS>
Inestimable
Dog
.
 
<EOS>
Flew
at
the
porter
fellow
when
he
was
put
into
the
dog
-
box
,
and
flew
at
the
guard
when
he
was
taken
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
half
-
a
-
dozen
fellows
into
a
Barn
,
and
a
good
supply
of
Rats
,
and
timed
the
Dog
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
the
Dog
able
to
do
it
immensely
,
made
the
match
,
and
heavily
backed
the
Dog
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
match
came
off
,
some
devil
of
a
fellow
was
bought
over
,
Sir
,
Dog
was
made
drunk
,
Dog
's
master
was
cleaned
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Wobbler
?
"
inquired
the
suitor
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
who
was
spreading
the
marmalade
returned
,
without
looking
up
from
that
occupation
,
"
What
did
he
call
the
Dog
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Called
him
Lovely
,
"
said
the
other
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Said
the
Dog
was
the
perfect
picture
of
the
old
aunt
from
whom
he
had
expectations
.
<EOS>
Found
him
particularly
like
her
when
hocussed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Wobbler
?
"
said
the
suitor
.
   
<EOS>
Both
gentlemen
laughed
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
with
the
gun
-
barrel
,
considering
it
,
on
inspection
,
in
a
satisfactory
state
,
referred
it
to
the
other
;
receiving
confirmation
of
his
views
,
he
fitted
it
into
its
place
in
the
case
before
him
,
and
took
out
the
stock
and
polished
that
,
softly
whistling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Wobbler
?
"
said
the
suitor
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
then
said
Mr
Wobbler
,
with
his
mouth
full
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
---
"
and
Arthur
Clennam
again
mechanically
set
forth
what
he
wanted
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
inform
you
,
"
observed
Mr
Wobbler
,
apparently
to
his
lunch
.
<EOS>
"
Never
heard
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Better
try
Mr
Clive
,
second
door
on
the
left
in
the
next
passage
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
will
give
me
the
same
answer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
"
said
Mr
Wobbler
.
   
<EOS>
The
suitor
turned
away
and
had
left
the
room
,
when
the
gentleman
with
the
gun
called
out
"
Mister
!
 
<EOS>
Hallo
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
in
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shut
the
door
after
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
letting
in
a
devil
of
a
draught
here
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
few
steps
brought
him
to
the
second
door
on
the
left
in
the
next
passage
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
room
he
found
three
gentlemen
;
number
one
doing
nothing
particular
,
number
two
doing
nothing
particular
,
number
three
doing
nothing
particular
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
,
however
,
to
be
more
directly
concerned
than
the
others
had
been
in
the
effective
execution
of
the
great
principle
of
the
office
,
as
there
was
an
awful
inner
apartment
with
a
double
door
,
in
which
the
Circumlocution
Sages
appeared
to
be
assembled
in
council
,
and
out
of
which
there
was
an
imposing
coming
of
papers
,
and
into
which
there
was
an
imposing
going
of
papers
,
almost
constantly
;
wherein
another
gentleman
,
number
four
,
was
the
active
instrument
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
,
"
said
Arthur
Clennam
,
---
and
again
stated
his
case
in
the
same
barrel
-
organ
way
.
 
<EOS>
As
number
one
referred
him
to
number
two
,
and
as
number
two
referred
him
to
number
three
,
he
had
occasion
to
state
it
three
times
before
they
all
referred
him
to
number
four
,
to
whom
he
stated
it
again
.
   
<EOS>
Number
four
was
a
vivacious
,
well
-
looking
,
well
-
dressed
,
agreeable
young
fellow
---
he
was
a
Barnacle
,
but
on
the
more
sprightly
side
of
the
family
---
and
he
said
in
an
easy
way
,
"
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
you
had
better
not
bother
yourself
about
it
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
bother
myself
about
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
I
recommend
you
not
to
bother
yourself
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
such
a
new
point
of
view
that
Arthur
Clennam
found
himself
at
a
loss
how
to
receive
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
give
you
plenty
of
forms
to
fill
up
.
<EOS>
Lots
of
'em
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
have
a
dozen
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
never
go
on
with
it
,
"
said
number
four
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
it
be
such
hopeless
work
?
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
;
I
am
a
stranger
in
England
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
it
would
be
hopeless
,
"
returned
number
four
,
with
a
frank
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
express
an
opinion
about
that
;
I
only
express
an
opinion
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
you
'd
go
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
of
course
,
you
can
do
as
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
was
a
failure
in
the
performance
of
a
contract
,
or
something
of
that
kind
,
was
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
That
you
can
find
out
.
 
<EOS>
Then
you
'll
find
out
what
Department
the
contract
was
in
,
and
then
you
'll
find
out
all
about
it
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
find
out
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
'll
---
you
'll
ask
till
they
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Then
you
'll
memorialise
that
Department
(
according
to
regular
forms
which
you
'll
find
out
)
for
leave
to
memorialise
this
Department
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
get
it
(
which
you
may
after
a
time
)
,
that
memorial
must
be
entered
in
that
Department
,
sent
to
be
registered
in
this
Department
,
sent
back
to
be
signed
by
that
Department
,
sent
back
to
be
countersigned
by
this
Department
,
and
then
it
will
begin
to
be
regularly
before
that
Department
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
find
out
when
the
business
passes
through
each
of
these
stages
by
asking
at
both
Departments
till
they
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
surely
this
is
not
the
way
to
do
the
business
,
"
Arthur
Clennam
could
not
help
saying
.
   
<EOS>
This
airy
young
Barnacle
was
quite
entertained
by
his
simplicity
in
supposing
for
a
moment
that
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
This
light
in
hand
young
Barnacle
knew
perfectly
that
it
was
not
.
 
<EOS>
This
touch
and
go
young
Barnacle
had
"
got
up
"
the
Department
in
a
private
secretaryship
,
that
he
might
be
ready
for
any
little
bit
of
fat
that
came
to
hand
;
and
he
fully
understood
the
Department
to
be
a
politico
-
diplomatic
hocus
pocus
piece
of
machinery
for
the
assistance
of
the
nobs
in
keeping
off
the
snobs
.
 
<EOS>
This
dashing
young
Barnacle
,
in
a
word
,
was
likely
to
become
a
statesman
,
and
to
make
a
figure
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
the
business
is
regularly
before
that
Department
,
whatever
it
is
,
"
pursued
this
bright
young
Barnacle
,
"
then
you
can
watch
it
from
time
to
time
through
that
Department
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
comes
regularly
before
this
Department
,
then
you
must
watch
it
from
time
to
time
through
this
Department
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
to
refer
it
right
and
left
;
and
when
we
refer
it
anywhere
,
then
you
'll
have
to
look
it
up
.
<EOS>
When
it
comes
back
to
us
at
any
time
,
then
you
had
better
look
US
up

<EOS>
When
it
sticks
anywhere
,
you
'll
have
to
try
to
give
it
a
jog
.
<EOS>
When
you
write
to
another
Department
about
it
,
and
then
to
this
Department
about
it
,
and
do
n't
hear
anything
satisfactory
about
it
,
why
then
you
had
better
---
keep
on
writing
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
looked
very
doubtful
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
obliged
to
you
at
any
rate
,
"
said
he
,
"
for
your
politeness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
replied
this
engaging
young
Barnacle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Try
the
thing
,
and
see
how
you
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
in
your
power
to
give
it
up
at
any
time
,
if
you
do
n't
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
take
a
lot
of
forms
away
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Give
him
a
lot
of
forms
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
which
instruction
to
number
two
,
this
sparkling
young
Barnacle
took
a
fresh
handful
of
papers
from
numbers
one
and
three
,
and
carried
them
into
the
sanctuary
to
offer
to
the
presiding
Idol
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
put
his
forms
in
his
pocket
gloomily
enough
,
and
went
his
way
down
the
long
stone
passage
and
the
long
stone
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
the
swing
doors
leading
into
the
street
,
and
was
waiting
,
not
over
patiently
,
for
two
people
who
were
between
him
and
them
to
pass
out
and
let
him
follow
,
when
the
voice
of
one
of
them
struck
familiarly
on
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
speaker
and
recognised
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
was
very
red
in
the
face
---
redder
than
travel
could
have
made
him
---
and
collaring
a
short
man
who
was
with
him
,
said
,
"
come
out
,
you
rascal
,
come
Out
!
"
   
<EOS>
it
was
such
an
unexpected
hearing
,
and
it
was
also
such
an
unexpected
sight
to
see
Mr
Meagles
burst
the
swing
doors
open
,
and
emerge
into
the
street
with
the
short
man
,
who
was
of
an
unoffending
appearance
,
that
Clennam
stood
still
for
the
moment
exchanging
looks
of
surprise
with
the
porter
.
 
<EOS>
He
followed
,
however
,
quickly
;
and
saw
Mr
Meagles
going
down
the
street
with
his
enemy
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
came
up
with
his
old
travelling
companion
,
and
touched
him
on
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
choleric
face
which
Mr
Meagles
turned
upon
him
smoothed
when
he
saw
who
it
was
,
and
he
put
out
his
friendly
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
just
come
over
from
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
.
 
Thank'ee
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Meagles
and
your
daughter
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
as
well
as
possible
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
you
had
come
upon
me
in
a
more
prepossessing
condition
as
to
coolness
.
"
   
<EOS>
Though
it
was
anything
but
a
hot
day
,
Mr
Meagles
was
in
a
heated
state
that
attracted
the
attention
of
the
passersby
;
more
particularly
as
he
leaned
his
back
against
a
railing
,
took
off
his
hat
and
cravat
,
and
heartily
rubbed
his
steaming
head
and
face
,
and
his
reddened
ears
and
neck
,
without
the
least
regard
for
public
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whew
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
dressing
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
am
cooler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
ruffled
,
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
bit
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
leisure
for
a
turn
in
the
Park
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
much
as
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
along
then
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
you
may
well
look
at
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
happened
to
have
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
offender
whom
Mr
Meagles
had
so
angrily
collared
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
something
to
look
at
,
that
fellow
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
not
much
to
look
at
,
either
in
point
of
size
or
in
point
of
dress
;
being
merely
a
short
,
square
,
practical
looking
man
,
whose
hair
had
turned
grey
,
and
in
whose
face
and
forehead
there
were
deep
lines
of
cogitation
,
which
looked
as
though
they
were
carved
in
hard
wood
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
decent
black
,
a
little
rusty
,
and
had
the
appearance
of
a
sagacious
master
in
some
handicraft
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
spectacle
-
case
in
his
hand
,
which
he
turned
over
and
over
while
he
was
thus
in
question
,
with
a
certain
free
use
of
the
thumb
that
is
never
seen
but
in
a
hand
accustomed
to
tools
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
keep
with
us
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
in
a
threatening
kind
of
Way
,
"
and
I
'll
introduce
you
presently
.
 
<EOS>
Now
then
!
"
   
Clennam
wondered
within
himself
,
as
they
took
the
nearest
way
to
the
Park
,
what
this
unknown
(
who
complied
in
the
gentlest
manner
)
could
have
been
doing
.
 
<EOS>
His
appearance
did
not
at
all
justify
the
suspicion
that
he
had
been
detected
in
designs
on
Mr
Meagles
's
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
nor
had
he
any
appearance
of
being
quarrelsome
or
violent
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
quiet
,
plain
,
steady
man
;
made
no
attempt
to
escape
;
and
seemed
a
little
depressed
,
but
neither
ashamed
nor
repentant
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
a
criminal
offender
,
he
must
surely
be
an
incorrigible
hypocrite
;
and
if
he
were
no
offender
,
why
should
Mr
Meagles
have
collared
him
in
the
Circumlocution
Office
?
 
<EOS>
He
perceived
that
the
man
was
not
a
difficulty
in
his
own
mind
alone
,
but
in
Mr
Meagles
's
too
;
for
such
conversation
as
they
had
together
on
the
short
way
to
the
Park
was
by
no
means
well
sustained
,
and
Mr
Meagles
's
eye
always
wandered
back
to
the
man
,
even
when
he
spoke
of
something
very
different
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
they
being
among
the
trees
,
Mr
Meagles
stopped
short
,
and
said
:
   
"
Mr
Clennam
,
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
look
at
this
man
?
 
<EOS>
His
name
is
Doyce
,
Daniel
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
suppose
this
man
to
be
a
notorious
rascal
;
would
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
should
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
really
a
disconcerting
question
,
with
the
man
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
suppose
him
to
be
a
public
offender
;
would
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
public
offender
.
 
<EOS>
What
has
he
been
guilty
of
?
 
<EOS>
Murder
,
manslaughter
,
arson
,
forgery
,
swindling
,
house
-
breaking
,
highway
robbery
,
larceny
,
conspiracy
,
fraud
?
 
<EOS>
Which
should
you
say
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
"
returned
Arthur
Clennam
,
observing
a
faint
smile
in
Daniel
Doyce
's
face
,
"
not
one
of
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
been
ingenious
,
and
he
has
been
trying
to
turn
his
ingenuity
to
his
country
's
service
.
<EOS>
That
makes
him
a
public
offender
directly
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
looked
at
the
man
himself
,
who
only
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
Doyce
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
is
a
smith
and
engineer
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
in
a
large
way
,
but
he
is
well
known
as
a
very
ingenious
man
.
 
<EOS>
A
dozen
years
ago
,
he
perfects
an
invention
(
involving
a
very
curious
secret
process
)
of
great
importance
to
his
country
and
his
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
say
how
much
money
it
cost
him
,
or
how
many
years
of
his
life
he
had
been
about
it
,
but
he
brought
it
to
perfection
a
dozen
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Was
n't
it
a
dozen
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
addressing
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
most
exasperating
man
in
the
world
;
he
never
complains
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Rather
better
than
twelve
years
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rather
better
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
you
mean
rather
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Clennam
,
he
addresses
himself
to
the
Government
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
he
addresses
himself
to
the
Government
,
he
becomes
a
public
offender
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
in
danger
of
making
himself
excessively
hot
again
,
"
he
ceases
to
be
an
innocent
citizen
,
and
becomes
a
culprit
.
   
<EOS>
He
is
treated
from
that
instant
as
a
man
who
has
done
some
infernal
action
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
to
be
shirked
,
put
off
,
brow
-
beaten
,
sneered
at
,
handed
over
by
this
highly
-
connected
young
or
old
gentleman
,
to
that
highly
-
connected
young
or
old
gentleman
,
and
dodged
back
again
;
he
is
a
man
with
no
rights
in
his
own
time
,
or
his
own
property
;
a
mere
outlaw
,
whom
it
is
justifiable
to
get
rid
of
anyhow
;
a
man
to
be
worn
out
by
all
possible
means
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
difficult
to
believe
,
after
the
morning
's
experience
,
as
Mr
Meagles
supposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
stand
there
,
Doyce
,
turning
your
spectacle
-
case
over
and
over
,
"
cried
Mr
Meagles
,
"
but
tell
Mr
Clennam
what
you
confessed
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
undoubtedly
was
made
to
feel
,
"
said
the
inventor
,
"
as
if
I
had
committed
an
offence
.
 
<EOS>
In
dancing
attendance
at
the
various
offices
,
I
was
always
treated
,
more
or
less
,
as
if
it
was
a
very
bad
offence
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
frequently
found
it
necessary
to
reflect
,
for
my
own
self
-
support
,
that
I
really
had
not
done
anything
to
bring
myself
into
the
Newgate
Calendar
,
but
only
wanted
to
effect
a
great
saving
and
a
great
improvement
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Judge
whether
I
exaggerate
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
'll
be
able
to
believe
me
when
I
tell
you
the
rest
of
the
case
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
prelude
,
Mr
Meagles
went
through
the
narrative
;
the
established
narrative
,
which
has
become
tiresome
;
the
matter
-
of
-
course
narrative
which
we
all
know
by
heart
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
after
interminable
attendance
and
correspondence
,
after
infinite
impertinences
,
ignorances
,
and
insults
,
my
lords
made
a
Minute
,
number
three
thousand
four
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
,
allowing
the
culprit
to
make
certain
trials
of
his
invention
at
his
own
expense
.
   
<EOS>
How
the
trials
were
made
in
the
presence
of
a
board
of
six
,
of
whom
two
ancient
members
were
too
blind
to
see
it
,
two
other
ancient
members
were
too
deaf
to
hear
it
,
one
other
ancient
member
was
too
lame
to
get
near
it
,
and
the
final
ancient
member
was
too
pig
-
headed
to
look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
there
were
more
years
;
more
impertinences
,
ignorances
,
and
insults
.
 
<EOS>
How
my
lords
then
made
a
Minute
,
number
five
thousand
one
hundred
and
three
,
whereby
they
resigned
the
business
to
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
in
course
of
time
,
took
up
the
business
as
if
it
were
a
bran
new
thing
of
yesterday
,
which
had
never
been
heard
of
before
;
muddled
the
business
,
addled
the
business
,
tossed
the
business
in
a
wet
blanket
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
impertinences
,
ignorances
,
and
insults
went
through
the
multiplication
table
.
 
<EOS>
How
there
was
a
reference
of
the
invention
to
three
Barnacles
and
a
Stiltstalking
,
who
knew
nothing
about
it
;
into
whose
heads
nothing
could
be
hammered
about
it
;
who
got
bored
about
it
,
and
reported
physical
impossibilities
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
in
a
Minute
,
number
eight
thousand
seven
hundred
and
forty
,
"
saw
no
reason
to
reverse
the
decision
at
which
my
lords
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
How
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
being
reminded
that
my
lords
had
arrived
at
no
decision
,
shelved
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
How
there
had
been
a
final
interview
with
the
head
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
that
very
morning
,
and
how
the
Brazen
Head
had
spoken
,
and
had
been
,
upon
the
whole
,
and
under
all
the
circumstances
,
and
looking
at
it
from
the
various
points
of
view
,
of
opinion
that
one
of
two
courses
was
to
be
pursued
in
respect
of
the
business
<EOS>
:
that
was
to
say
,
either
to
leave
it
alone
for
evermore
,
or
to
begin
it
all
over
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
which
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
as
a
practical
man
,
I
then
<EOS>
and
there
,
in
that
presence
,
took
Doyce
by
the
collar
,
and
told
him
it
was
plain
to
me
that
he
was
an
infamous
rascal
and
treasonable
disturber
of
the
government
peace
,
and
took
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
brought
him
out
of
the
office
door
by
the
collar
,
that
the
very
porter
might
know
I
was
a
practical
man
who
appreciated
the
official
estimate
of
such
characters
;
and
here
we
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
If
that
airy
young
Barnacle
had
been
there
,
he
would
have
frankly
told
them
perhaps
that
the
Circumlocution
Office
had
achieved
its
function
.
 
<EOS>
That
what
the
Barnacles
had
to
do
,
was
to
stick
on
to
the
national
ship
as
long
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
That
to
trim
the
ship
,
lighten
the
ship
,
clean
the
ship
,
would
be
to
knock
them
off
;
that
they
could
but
be
knocked
off
once
;
and
that
if
the
ship
went
down
with
them
yet
sticking
to
it
,
that
was
the
ship
's
look
out
,
and
not
theirs
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
now
you
know
all
about
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
Except
,
which
I
own
does
not
improve
my
state
of
mind
,
that
even
now
you
do
n't
hear
him
complain
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
great
patience
,
"
said
Arthur
Clennam
,
looking
at
him
with
some
wonder
,
"
great
forbearance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
returned
,
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
more
than
another
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
Lord
,
you
have
more
than
I
have
,
though
!
"
cried
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
Doyce
smiled
,
as
he
said
to
Clennam
,
"
You
see
,
my
experience
of
these
things
does
not
begin
with
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
in
my
way
to
know
a
little
about
them
from
time
to
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
is
not
a
particular
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
worse
used
than
a
hundred
others
who
have
put
themselves
in
the
same
position
---
than
all
the
others
,
I
was
going
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
should
find
that
a
consolation
,
if
it
were
my
case
;
but
I
am
very
glad
that
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Understand
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
,
"
he
replied
in
his
steady
,
planning
way
,
and
looking
into
the
distance
before
him
as
if
his
grey
eye
were
measuring
it
,
"
that
it
's
recompense
for
a
man
's
toil
and
hope
;
but
it
's
a
certain
sort
of
relief
to
know
that
I
might
have
counted
on
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
that
quiet
deliberate
manner
,
and
in
that
undertone
,
which
is
often
observable
in
mechanics
who
consider
and
adjust
with
great
nicety
.
 
<EOS>
It
belonged
to
him
like
his
suppleness
of
thumb
,
or
his
peculiar
way
of
tilting
up
his
hat
at
the
back
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
if
he
were
contemplating
some
half
-
finished
work
of
his
hand
and
thinking
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Disappointed
?
"
<EOS>
he
went
on
,
as
he
walked
between
them
under
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
I
am
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
Hurt
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
I
am
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
only
natural
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
I
mean
when
I
say
that
people
who
put
themselves
in
the
same
position
are
mostly
used
in
the
same
way
---
"
   
"
In
England
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
mean
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
take
their
inventions
into
foreign
countries
,
that
's
quite
different
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
's
the
reason
why
so
many
go
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
very
hot
indeed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
is
,
that
however
this
comes
to
be
the
regular
way
of
our
government
,
it
is
its
regular
way
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
heard
of
any
projector
or
inventor
who
failed
to
find
it
all
but
inaccessible
,
and
whom
it
did
not
discourage
and
ill
-
treat
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
ever
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
ever
known
it
to
be
beforehand
in
the
adoption
of
any
useful
thing
?
 
<EOS>
Ever
known
it
to
set
an
example
of
any
useful
kind
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
good
deal
older
than
my
friend
here
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
and
I
'll
answer
that
.
 
<EOS>
Never
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
we
all
three
have
known
,
I
expect
,
"
said
the
inventor
,
"
a
pretty
many
cases
of
its
fixed
determination
to
be
miles
upon
miles
,
and
years
upon
years
,
behind
the
rest
of
us
;
and
of
its
being
found
out
persisting
in
the
use
of
things
long
superseded
,
even
after
the
better
things
were
well
known
and
generally
taken
up
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
all
agreed
upon
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
"
said
Doyce
,
with
a
sigh
,
"
as
I
know
what
such
a
metal
will
do
at
such
a
temperature
,
and
such
a
body
under
such
a
pressure
,
so
I
may
know
(
if
I
will
only
consider
)
,
how
these
great
lords
and
gentlemen
will
certainly
deal
with
such
a
matter
as
mine
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
be
surprised
,
with
a
head
upon
my
shoulders
,
and
memory
in
it
,
that
I
fall
into
the
ranks
with
all
who
came
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
let
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
warning
enough
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
put
up
his
spectacle
-
case
,
and
said
to
Arthur
,
"
If
I
do
n't
complain
,
Mr
Clennam
,
I
can
feel
gratitude
;
and
I
assure
you
that
I
feel
it
towards
our
mutual
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Many
's
the
day
,
and
many
's
the
way
in
which
he
has
backed
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stuff
and
nonsense
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
could
not
but
glance
at
Daniel
Doyce
in
the
ensuing
silence
.
   
<EOS>
Though
it
was
evidently
in
the
grain
of
his
character
,
and
of
his
respect
for
his
own
case
,
that
he
should
abstain
from
idle
murmuring
,
it
was
evident
that
he
had
grown
the
older
,
the
sterner
,
and
the
poorer
,
for
his
long
endeavour
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
think
what
a
blessed
thing
it
would
have
been
for
this
man
,
if
he
had
taken
a
lesson
from
the
gentlemen
who
were
so
kind
as
to
take
a
nation
's
affairs
in
charge
,
and
had
learnt
How
not
to
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
was
hot
and
despondent
for
about
five
minutes
,
and
then
began
to
cool
and
clear
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
make
this
the
better
by
being
grim
.
 
<EOS>
Where
do
you
think
of
going
,
Dan
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
back
to
the
factory
,
"
said
Dan
.
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
we
'll
all
go
back
to
the
factory
,
or
walk
in
that
direction
,
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
wo
n't
be
deterred
by
its
being
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
?
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
go
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
,
"
cried
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
along
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
they
went
along
,
certainly
one
of
the
party
,
and
probably
more
than
one
,
thought
that
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
was
no
inappropriate
destination
for
a
man
who
had
been
in
official
correspondence
with
my
lords
and
the
Barnacles
---
and
perhaps
had
a
misgiving
also
that
Britannia
herself
might
come
to
look
for
lodgings
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
some
ugly
day
or
other
,
if
she
over

did

Chapter

.
<EOS>
Let
Loose
 
<EOS>
A
late
,
dull
autumn
night
was
closing
in
upon
the
river
Saone
.
 
<EOS>
The
stream
,
like
a
sullied
looking
-
glass
in
a
gloomy
place
,
reflected
the
clouds
heavily
;
and
the
low
banks
leaned
over
here
and
there
,
as
if
they
were
half
curious
,
and
half
afraid
,
to
see
their
darkening
pictures
in
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
flat
expanse
of
country
about
Chalons
lay
a
long
heavy
streak
,
occasionally
made
a
little
ragged
by
a
row
of
poplar
trees
against
the
wrathful
sunset
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
banks
of
the
river
Saone
it
was
wet
,
depressing
,
solitary
;
and
the
night
deepened
fast
.
   
<EOS>
One
man
slowly
moving
on
towards
Chalons
was
the
only
visible
figure
in
the
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
Cain
might
have
looked
as
lonely
and
avoided
.
 
<EOS>
With
an
old
sheepskin
knapsack
at
his
back
,
and
a
rough
,
unbarked
stick
cut
out
of
some
wood
in
his
hand
;
miry
,
footsore
,
his
shoes
and
gaiters
trodden
out
,
his
hair
and
beard
untrimmed
;
the
cloak
he
carried
over
his
shoulder
,
and
the
clothes
he
wore
,
sodden
with
wet
;
limping
along
in
pain
and
difficulty
;
he
looked
as
if
the
clouds
were
hurrying
from
him
,
as
if
the
wail
of
the
wind
and
the
shuddering
of
the
grass
were
directed
against
him
,
as
if
the
low
mysterious
plashing
of
the
water
murmured
at
him
,
as
if
the
fitful
autumn
night
were
disturbed
by
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
glanced
here
,
and
he
glanced
there
,
sullenly
but
shrinkingly
;
and
sometimes
stopped
and
turned
about
,
and
looked
all
round
him
.
<EOS>
Then
he
limped
on
again
,
toiling
and
muttering
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
devil
with
this
plain
that
has
no
end
!
 
<EOS>
To
the
devil
with
these
stones
that
cut
like
knives
!
 
<EOS>
To
the
devil
with
this
dismal
darkness
,
wrapping
itself
about
one
with
a
chill
!
 
<EOS>
I
hate
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
he
would
have
visited
his
hatred
upon
it
all
with
the
scowl
he
threw
about
him
,
if
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
He
trudged
a
little
further
;
and
looking
into
the
distance
before
him
,
stopped
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
,
hungry
,
thirsty
,
weary
.
 
<EOS>
You
,
imbeciles
,
where
the
lights
are
yonder
,
eating
and
drinking
,
and
warming
yourselves
at
fires
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
the
sacking
of
your
town
;
I
would
repay
you
,
my
children
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
the
teeth
he
set
at
the
town
,
and
the
hand
he
shook
at
the
town
,
brought
the
town
no
nearer
;
and
the
man
was
yet
hungrier
,
and
thirstier
,
and
wearier
,
when
his
feet
were
on
its
jagged
pavement
,
and
he
stood
looking
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
the
hotel
with
its
gateway
,
and
its
savoury
smell
of
cooking
;
there
was
the
cafe
with
its
bright
windows
,
and
its
rattling
of
dominoes
;
there
was
the
dyer
's
with
its
strips
of
red
cloth
on
the
doorposts
;
there
was
the
silversmith
's
with
its
earrings
,
and
its
offerings
for
altars
;
there
was
the
tobacco
dealer
's
with
its
lively
group
of
soldier
customers
coming
out
pipe
in
mouth
;
there
were
the
bad
odours
of
the
town
,
and
the
rain
and
the
refuse
in
the
kennels
,
and
the
faint
lamps
slung
across
the
road
,
and
the
huge
Diligence
,
and
its
mountain
of
luggage
,
and
its
six
grey
horses
with
their
tails
tied
up
,
getting
under
weigh
at
the
coach
office
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
small
cabaret
for
a
straitened
traveller
being
within
sight
<EOS>
,
he
had
to
seek
one
round
<EOS>
the
dark
corner
,
where
the
cabbage
leaves
lay
thickest
,
trodden
about
the
public
cistern
at
which
women
had
not
yet
left
off
drawing
water
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
in
the
back
street
he
found
one
,
the
Break
of
Day
.
 
<EOS>
The
curtained
windows
clouded
the
Break
of
Day
,
but
it
seemed
light
and
warm
,
and
it
announced
in
legible
inscriptions
with
appropriate
pictorial
embellishment
of
billiard
cue
and
ball
,
that
at
the
Break
of
Day
one
could
play
billiards
;
that
there
one
could
find
meat
,
drink
,
and
lodgings
,
whether
one
came
on
horseback
,
or
came
on
foot
;
and
that
it
kept
good
wines
,
liqueurs
,
and
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
turned
the
handle
of
the
Break
of
Day
door
,
and
limped
in
.
   
<EOS>
He
touched
his
discoloured
slouched
hat
,
as
he
came
in
at
the
door
,
to
a
few
men
who
occupied
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Two
were
playing
dominoes
at
one
of
the
little
tables
;
three
or
four
were
seated
round
the
stove
,
conversing
as
they
smoked
;
the
billiard
-
table
in
the
centre
was
left
alone
for
the
time
;
the
landlady
of
the
Daybreak
sat
behind
her
little
counter
among
her
cloudy
bottles
of
syrups
,
baskets
of
cakes
,
and
leaden
drainage
for
glasses
,
working
at
her
needle
.
   
<EOS>
Making
his
way
to
an
empty
little
table
in
a
corner
of
the
room
behind
the
stove
,
he
put
down
his
knapsack
and
his
cloak
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
raised
his
head
from
stooping
to
do
so
,
he
found
the
landlady
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
can
lodge
here
to
-
night
,
madame
?
"
   
"
Perfectly
!
"
said
the
landlady
in
a
high
,
sing
-
song
,
cheery
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
.
 
<EOS>
One
can
dine
---
<EOS>
sup
---
what
you
please
to
call
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
perfectly
!
"
cried
the
landlady
as
before
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dispatch
then
,
madame
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Something
to
eat
,
as
quickly
as
you
can
;
and
some
wine
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
exhausted
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
bad
weather
,
monsieur
,
"
said
the
landlady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cursed
weather
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
a
very
long
road
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
cursed
road
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
hoarse
voice
failed
him
,
and
he
rested
his
head
upon
his
hands
until
a
bottle
of
wine
was
brought
from
the
counter
.
 
<EOS>
Having
filled
and
emptied
his
little
tumbler
twice
,
and
having
broken
off
an
end
from
the
great
loaf
that
was
set
before
him
with
his
cloth
and
napkin
,
soup
-
plate
,
salt
,
pepper
,
and
oil
,
he
rested
his
back
against
the
corner
of
the
wall
,
made
a
couch
of
the
bench
on
which
he
sat
,
and
began
to
chew
crust
,
until
such
time
as
his
repast
should
be
ready
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
that
momentary
interruption
of
the
talk
about
the
stove
,
and
that
temporary
inattention
to
and
distraction
from
one
another
,
which
is
usually
inseparable
in
such
a
company
from
the
arrival
of
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
passed
over
by
this
time
;
and
the
men
had
done
glancing
at
him
,
and
were
talking
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
true
reason
,
"
said
one
of
them
,
bringing
a
story
he
had
been
telling
,
to
a
close
,
<EOS>
"
that
's
the
true
reason
why
they
said
that
the
devil
was
let
loose
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
speaker
was
the
tall
Swiss
belonging
to
the
church
,
and
he
brought
something
of
the
authority
of
the
church
into
the
discussion
---
especially
as
the
devil
was
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
The
landlady
having
given
her
directions
for
the
new
guest
's
entertainment
to
her
husband
,
who
acted
as
cook
to
the
Break
of
Day
,
had
resumed
her
needlework
behind
her
counter
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
smart
,
neat
,
bright
little
woman
,
with
a
good
deal
of
cap
and
a
good
deal
of
stocking
,
and
she
struck
into
the
conversation
with
several
laughing
nods
of
her
head
,
but
without
looking
up
from
her
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
Heaven
,
then
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
the
boat
came
up
from
Lyons
,
and
brought
the
news
that
the
devil
was
actually
let
loose
at
Marseilles
,
some
fly
-
catchers
swallowed
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
not
I.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madame
,
you
are
always
right
,
"
returned
the
tall
Swiss
.
<EOS>
"
Doubtless
you
were
enraged
against
that
man
,
madame
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
yes
,
then
!
"
cried
the
landlady
,
raising
her
eyes
from
her
work
,
opening
them
very
wide
,
and
tossing
her
head
on
one
side
.
"
<EOS>
Naturally
,
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
bad
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
wicked
wretch
,
"
said
the
landlady
,
"
and
well
merited
what
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
worse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
madame
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
see
,
"
returned
the
Swiss
,
argumentatively
turning
his
cigar
between
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
have
been
his
unfortunate
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
been
the
child
of
circumstances
.
<EOS>
It
is
always
possible
that
he
had
,
and
has
,
good
in
him
if
one
did
but
know
how
to
find
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
Philosophical
philanthropy
teaches
---
"
   
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
little
knot
about
the
stove
murmured
an
objection
to
the
introduction
of
that
threatening
expression
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
two
players
at
dominoes
glanced
up
from
their
game
,
as
if
to
protest
against
philosophical
philanthropy
being
brought
by
name
into
the
Break
of
Day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
there
,
you
and
your
philanthropy
,
"
cried
the
smiling
landlady
,
nodding
her
head
more
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
woman
,
I.
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
philosophical
philanthropy
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
what
I
have
seen
,
and
what
I
have
looked
in
the
face
in
this
world
here
,
where
I
find
myself
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
tell
you
this
,
my
friend
,
that
there
are
people
(
men
and
women
both
,
unfortunately
)
who
have
no
good
in
them
---
none
.
 
<EOS>
That
there
are
people
whom
it
is
necessary
to
detest
without
compromise
.
 
<EOS>
That
there
are
people
who
must
be
dealt
with
as
enemies
of
the
human
race
.
 
<EOS>
That
there
are
people
who
have
no
human
heart
,
and
who
must
be
crushed
like
savage
beasts
and
cleared
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
but
few
,
I
hope
;
but
I
have
seen
(
in
this
world
here
where
I
find
myself
,
and
even
at
the
little
Break
of
Day
)
that
there
are
such
people
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
not
doubt
that
this
man
---
whatever
they
call
him
,
I
forget
his
name
---
is
one
of
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlady
's
lively
speech
was
received
with
greater
favour
at
the
Break
of
Day
,
than
it
would
have
elicited
from
certain
amiable
whitewashers
of
the
class
she
so
unreasonably
objected
to
,
nearer
Great
Britain
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
faith
!
 
<EOS>
If
your
philosophical
philanthropy
,
"
said
the
landlady
,
putting
down
her
work
,
and
rising
to
take
the
stranger
's
soup
from
her
husband
,
who
appeared
with
it
at
a
side
door
,
"
puts
anybody
at
the
mercy
of
such
people
by
holding
terms
with
them
at
all
,
in
words
or
deeds
,
or
both
,
take
it
away
from
the
Break
of
Day
,
for
it
is
n't
worth
a
sou
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
placed
the
soup
before
the
guest
,
who
changed
his
attitude
to
a
sitting
one
,
he
looked
her
full
in
the
face
,
and
his
moustache
went
up
under
his
nose
,
and
his
nose
came
down
over
his
moustache
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
previous
speaker
,
"
let
us
come
back
to
our
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
all
that
aside
,
gentlemen
,
it
was
because
the
man
was
acquitted
on
his
trial
that
people
said
at
Marseilles
that
the
devil
was
let
loose
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
how
the
phrase
began
to
circulate
,
and
what
it
meant
;
nothing
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
they
call
him
?
"
said
the
landlady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Biraud
,
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rigaud
,
madame
,
"
returned
the
tall
Swiss
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rigaud
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
traveller
's
soup
was
succeeded
by
a
dish
of
meat
,
and
that
by
a
dish
of
vegetables
.
 
<EOS>
He
ate
all
that
was
placed
before
him
,
emptied
his
bottle
of
wine
,
called
for
a
glass
of
rum
,
and
smoked
his
cigarette
with
his
cup
of
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
became
refreshed
,
he
became
overbearing
;
and
patronised
the
company
at
the
Daybreak
in
certain
small
talk
at
which
he
assisted
,
as
if
his
condition
were
far
above
his
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
The
company
might
have
had
other
engagements
,
or
they
might
have
felt
their
inferiority
,
but
in
any
case
they
dispersed
by
degrees
,
and
not
being
replaced
by
other
company
,
left
their
new
patron
in
possession
of
the
Break
of
Day
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlord
was
clinking
about
in
his
kitchen
;
the
landlady
was
quiet
at
her
work
;
and
the
refreshed
traveller
sat
smoking
by
the
stove
,
warming
his
ragged
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
madame
---
that
Biraud
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rigaud
,
monsieur
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
Pardon
me
again
---
has
contracted
your
displeasure
,
<EOS>
how
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlady
,
who
had
been
at
one
moment
thinking
within
herself
that
this
was
a
handsome
man
,
at
another
moment
that
this
was
an
ill
-
looking
man
,
observed
the
nose
coming
down
and
the
moustache
going
up
,
and
strongly
inclined
to
the
latter
decision
.
 
<EOS>
Rigaud
was
a
criminal
,
she
said
,
who
had
killed
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
?
 
<EOS>
Death
of
my
life
,
that
's
a
criminal
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
do
you
know
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
the
world
knows
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hah
!
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
escaped
justice
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
the
law
could
not
prove
it
against
him
to
its
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
law
says
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
all
the
world
knows
he
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
knew
it
so
well
,
that
they
tried
to
tear
him
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Being
all
in
perfect
accord
with
their
own
wives
?
"
said
the
guest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Haha
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlady
of
the
Break
of
Day
looked
at
him
again
,
and
felt
almost
confirmed
in
her
last
decision
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
fine
hand
,
though
,
and
he
turned
it
with
a
great
show
.
 
<EOS>
She
began
once
more
to
think
that
he
was
not
ill
-
looking
after
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
mention
,
madame
---
or
was
it
mentioned
among
the
gentlemen
<EOS>
---
what
became
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
landlady
shook
her
head
;
it
being
the
first
conversational
stage
at
which
her
vivacious
earnestness
had
ceased
to
nod
it
,
keeping
time
to
what
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
mentioned
at
the
Daybreak
,
she
remarked
,
on
the
authority
of
the
journals
,
that
he
had
been
kept
in
prison
for
his
own
safety
.
 
<EOS>
However
that
might
be
,
he
had
escaped
his
deserts
;
so
much
the
worse
.
   
<EOS>
The
guest
sat
looking
at
her
as
he
smoked
out
his
final
cigarette
,
and
as
she
sat
with
her
head
bent
over
her
work
,
with
an
expression
that
might
have
resolved
her
doubts
,
and
brought
her
to
a
lasting
conclusion
on
the
subject
of
his
good
or
bad
looks
if
she
had
seen
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
did
look
up
,
the
expression
was
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
hand
was
smoothing
his
shaggy
moustache
.
<EOS>
"
May
one
ask
to
be
shown
to
bed
,
madame
?
"
   
<EOS>
Very
willingly
,
monsieur
.
 
<EOS>
Hola
,
my
husband
!
 
<EOS>
My
husband
would
conduct
him
up
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
traveller
there
,
asleep
,
who
had
gone
to
bed
very
early
indeed
,
being
overpowered
by
fatigue
;
but
it
was
a
large
chamber
with
two
beds
in
it
,
and
space
enough
for
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
This
the
landlady
of
the
Break
of
Day
chirpingly
explained
,
calling
between
whiles
,
"
Hola
,
my
husband
!
"
<EOS>
out
at
the
side
door
.
   
<EOS>
My
husband
answered
at
length
,
"
It
is
I
,
my
wife
!
"
and
presenting
himself
in
his
cook
's
cap
,
lighted
the
traveller
up
a
steep
and
narrow
staircase
;
<EOS>
the
traveller
carrying
his
own
cloak
and
knapsack
,
and
bidding
the
landlady
good
night
with
a
complimentary
reference
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
again
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
room
,
with
a
rough
splintery
floor
,
unplastered
rafters
overhead
,
and
two
bedsteads
on
opposite
sides
.
 
<EOS>
Here
"
my
husband
"
put
down
the
candle
he
carried
,
and
with
a
sidelong
look
at
his
guest
stooping
over
his
knapsack
,
gruffly
gave
him
the
instruction
,
"
The
bed
to
the
right
!
"
and
left
him
to
his
repose
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
whether
he
was
a
good
or
a
bad
physiognomist
,
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
that
the
guest
was
an
ill
-
looking
fellow
.
   
<EOS>
The
guest
looked
contemptuously
at
the
clean
coarse
bedding
prepared
for
him
,
and
,
sitting
down
on
the
rush
chair
at
the
bedside
,
drew
his
money
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
told
it
over
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
must
eat
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
,
"
but
by
Heaven
I
must
eat
at
the
cost
of
some
other
man
to
-
morrow
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
sat
pondering
,
and
mechanically
weighing
his
money
in
his
palm
,
<EOS>
the
deep
breathing
of
the
traveller
in
the
other
bed
fell
so
regularly
upon
his
hearing
that
it
attracted
his
eyes
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
was
covered
up
warm
,
and
had
drawn
the
white
curtain
at
his
head
,
so
that
he
could
be
only
heard
,
not
seen
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
deep
regular
breathing
,
still
going
on
while
the
other
was
taking
off
his
worn
shoes
and
gaiters
,
and
still
continuing
when
he
had
laid
aside
his
coat
and
cravat
,
<EOS>
became
at
length
a
strong
provocative
to
curiosity
,
and
incentive
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
sleeper
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
The
waking
traveller
,
therefore
,
stole
a
little
nearer
,
and
yet
a
little
nearer
,
and
a
little
nearer
to
the
sleeping
traveller
's
bed
,
until
he
stood
close
beside
it
.
 
<EOS>
Even
then
he
could
not
see
his
face
,
for
he
had
drawn
the
sheet
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
regular
breathing
still
continuing
,
he
put
his
smooth
white
hand
(
such
a
treacherous
hand
it
looked
,
as
it
went
creeping
from
him
!
)
<EOS>
to
the
sheet
,
and
gently
lifted
it
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Death
of
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
,
falling
back
,
"
here
's
Cavalletto
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
little
Italian
,
previously
influenced
in
his
sleep
,
perhaps
,
by
the
stealthy
presence
at
his
bedside
,
stopped
in
his
regular
breathing
,
and
with
a
long
deep
respiration
opened
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
they
were
not
awake
,
though
open
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
for
some
seconds
looking
placidly
at
his
old
prison
companion
,
and
then
,
all
at
once
,
with
a
cry
of
surprise
and
alarm
,
sprang
out
of
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Keep
quiet
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
I.
 
<EOS>
You
know
me
?
"
cried
the
other
,
in
a
suppressed
voice
.
   
<EOS>
But
John
Baptist
,
widely
staring
,
muttering
a
number
of
invocations
and
ejaculations
,
tremblingly
backing
into
a
corner
,
slipping
on
his
trousers
,
and
tying
his
coat
by
the
two
sleeves
<EOS>
round
his
neck
,
manifested
an
unmistakable
desire
to
escape
by
the
door
rather
than
renew
the
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
this
,
his
old
prison
comrade
fell
back
upon
the
door
,
and
set
his
shoulders
against
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cavalletto
!
 
<EOS>
Wake
,
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Rub
your
eyes
and
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
Not
the
name
you
used
to
call
me
---
do
n't
use
that
---
Lagnier
,
say
Lagnier
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
Baptist
,
staring
at
him
with
<EOS>
eyes
opened
to
their
utmost
width
,
made
a
number
of
those
national
,
backhanded
shakes
of
the
right
forefinger
in
the
air
,
as
if
he
were
resolved
on
negativing
beforehand
everything
that
the
other
could
possibly
advance
during
the
whole
term
of
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cavalletto
!
 
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
Lagnier
,

Touch
the
hand
of
a
gentleman
!
"
   
<EOS>
Submitting
himself
to
the
old
tone
of
condescending
authority
,
John
Baptist
,
not
at
all
steady
on
his
legs
as
yet
,
advanced
and
put
his
hand
in
his
patron
's
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Lagnier
laughed
;
and
having
given
it
a
squeeze
,
tossed
it
up
and
let
it
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
were
---
"
faltered
John
Baptist
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
shaved
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
See
here
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lagnier
,
giving
his
head
a
twirl
;
"
as
tight
on
as
your
own
.
"
   
<EOS>
John
Baptist
,
with
a
slight
shiver
,
looked
all
round
the
room
as
if
to
recall
where
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
His
patron
took
that
opportunity
of
turning
the
key
in
the
door
,
and
then
sat
down
upon
his
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
holding
up
his
shoes
and
gaiters
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
poor
trim
for
a
gentleman
,
you
'll
say
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
,
you
shall
see
how
Soon
I
'll
mend
it
.
 
<EOS>
Come
and
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Take
your
old
place
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
Baptist
,
looking
anything
but
reassured
,
sat
down
on
the
floor
at
the
bedside
,
keeping
his
eyes
upon
his
patron
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lagnier
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
we
might
be
in
the
old
infernal
hole
again
,
<EOS>
hey
?
 
<EOS>
How
long
have
you
been
out
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Two
days
after
you

my

<EOS>
"
How
do
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
cautioned
not
to
stay
there
,
and
so
I
left
the
town
at
once
,
and
since
then
I
have
changed
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
doing
odds
and
ends
at
Avignon
,
at
Pont
Esprit
,
at
Lyons
;
upon
the
Rhone
,
upon
the
Saone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
rapidly
mapped
the
places
out
with
his
sunburnt
hand
upon
the
floor
.
"
<EOS>
And
where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
,
my
master
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
Baptist
seemed
to
desire
to
evade
the
question
without
knowing
how
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
Bacchus
!
"
he
said
at
last
,
as
if
he
were
forced
to
the
admission
,
"
I
have
sometimes
had
a
thought
of
going
to
Paris
,
and
perhaps
to
England
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cavalletto
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
in
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
I
also
am
going
to
Paris
and
perhaps
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
go
together
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
little
man
nodded
his
head
,
and
showed
his
teeth
;
and
yet
seemed
not
quite
convinced
that
it
was
a
surpassingly
desirable
arrangement
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
'll
go
together
,
"
repeated
Lagnier
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
how
soon
I
will
force
myself
to
be
recognised
as
a
gentleman
,
and
you
shall
profit
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
agreed
?
 
<EOS>
Are
we
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
surely
,
surely
!
"
said
the
little
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
shall
hear
before
I
sleep

and
in
six
words
,
for
I
want
sleep

how
I
appear
before
you

I

Lagnier

<EOS>
Remember
that

<EOS>
Not
the
other

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Altro
,
altro
!
 
<EOS>
Not
Ri
---
"
<EOS>
Before
John
Baptist
could
finish
the
name
,
his
comrade
had
got
his
hand
under
his
chin
and
fiercely
shut
up
his
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Death
!
 
<EOS>
what
are
you
doing
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
want
me

<EOS>
Do
YOU
want
to
be
trampled
upon

stoned

<EOS>
You
would
be

<EOS>
You
do
n't
imagine
that

would
set
upon
me
,

let
my
prison
chum
go

<EOS>
Do
n't
think
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
was
an
expression
in
his
face
as
he
released
his
grip
of
his
friend
's
jaw
,
from
which
his
friend
inferred
that
if
the
course
of
events
really
came
to
any
stoning
and
trampling
,
Monsieur
Lagnier
would
so
distinguish
him
with
his
notice
as
to
ensure
his
having
his
full
share
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
remembered
what
a
cosmopolitan
gentleman
Monsieur
Lagnier
was
,
and
how
few
weak
distinctions
he
made
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
man
,
"
said
Monsieur
Lagnier
,
"
whom
society
has
deeply
wronged
since
you
last
saw
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
am
sensitive
and
brave
,
and
that
it
is
my
character
to
govern
.
 
<EOS>
How
has
society
respected
those
qualities
in
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
shrieked
at
through
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
guarded
through
the
streets
against
men
,
and
especially
women
,
running
at
me
armed
with
any
weapons
<EOS>
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lain
in
prison
for
security
,
with
the
place
of
my
confinement
kept
a
secret
,
lest
I
should
be
torn
out
of
it
and
felled
by
a
hundred
blows
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
carted
out
of
Marseilles
in
the
dead
of
night
,
and
carried
leagues
away
from
it
packed
in
straw
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
not
been
safe
for
me
to
go
near
my
house
;
and
,
with
a
beggar
's
pittance
in
my
pocket
,
I
have
walked
through
vile
mud
and
weather
ever
since
,
until
my
feet
are
crippled
---
look
at
them
!
 
<EOS>
Such
are
the
humiliations
that
society
has
inflicted
upon
me
,
possessing
the
qualities
I
have
mentioned
,
and
which
you
know
me
to
possess
.
 
<EOS>
But
society
shall
pay
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
All
this
he
said
in
his
companion
's
ear
,
and
with
his
hand
before
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Even
here
,
"
he
went
on
in
the
same
way
,
"
even
in
this
mean
drinking
-
shop
,
society
pursues
me
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
defames
me
,
and
her
guests
defame
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
a
gentleman
with
manners
and
accomplishments
to
strike
them
dead
!
 
<EOS>
But
the
wrongs
society
has
heaped
upon
me
are
treasured
in
this
breast
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
all
of
which
John
Baptist
,
listening
attentively
to
the
suppressed
hoarse
voice
,
said
from
time
to
time
,
"
Surely
,
surely
!
"
<EOS>
tossing
his
head
and
shutting
his
eyes
,
as
if
there
were
the
clearest
case
against
society
that
perfect
candour
could
make
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Put
my
shoes
there
,
"
continued
Lagnier
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hang
my
cloak
to
dry
there
by
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Take
my
hat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
obeyed
each
instruction
,
as
it
was
given
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
this
is
the
bed
to
which
society
consigns
me
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Hah
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
stretched
out
his
length
upon
it
,
with
a
ragged
handkerchief
bound
round
his
wicked
head
,
and
only
his
wicked
head
showing
above
the
bedclothes
,
John
Baptist
was
rather
strongly
reminded
of
what
had
so
very
nearly
happened
to
prevent
the
moustache
from
any
more
going
up
as
it
did
,
and
the
nose
from
any
more
coming
down
as
it
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shaken
out
of
destiny
's
dice
-
box
again
into
your
company
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
profit
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
need
a
long
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
sleep
in
the
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
John
Baptist
replied
that
he
should
sleep
as
long
as
he
would
,
and
wishing
him
a
happy
night
,
put
out
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
One
might
have
Supposed
that
the
next
proceeding
of
the
Italian
would
have
been
to
undress
;
but
he
did
exactly
the
reverse
,
and
dressed
himself
from
head
to
foot
,
saving
his
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
so
done
,
he
lay
down
upon
his
bed
with
some
of
its
coverings
over
him
,
and
his
coat
still
tied
round
his
neck
,
to
get
through
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
started
up
,
the
Godfather
Break
of
Day
was
peeping
at
its
namesake
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
,
took
his
shoes
in
his
hand
,
turned
the
key
in
the
door
with
great
caution
,
and
crept
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
was
astir
there
<EOS>
but
the
smell
of
coffee
,
wine
,
tobacco
,
and
syrups
;
and
madame
's
little
counter
looked
ghastly
enough
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
paid
madame
his
little
note
at
it
over
night
,
and
wanted
to
see
nobody
<EOS>
---
wanted
nothing
but
to
get
on
his
shoes
and
his
knapsack
,
open
the
door
,
and
run
away
.
   
<EOS>
He
prospered
in
his
object
.
 
<EOS>
No
movement
or
voice
was
heard
when
he
opened
the
door
;
no
wicked
head
tied
up
in
a
ragged
handkerchief
looked
out
of
the
upper
window
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
sun
had
raised
his
full
disc
above
the
flat
line
of
the
horizon
,
and
was
striking
fire
out
of
the
long
muddy
vista
of
paved
road
with
its
weary
avenue
of
little
trees
,
a
black
speck
moved
along
the
road
and
splashed
among
the
flaming
pools
of
rain
-
water
,
which
black
speck
was
John
Baptist
Cavalletto
running
away
from
his
patron
.

Bleeding
Heart
Yard
 
<EOS>
In
London
itself
,
though
in
the
old
rustic
road
towards
a
suburb
of
note
where
in
the
days
of
William
Shakespeare
,
author
and
stage
-
player
,
there
were
Royal
hunting
-
seats
---
<EOS>
howbeit
<EOS>
no
sport
is
left
there
now
but
for
hunters
of
men
<EOS>
---
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
was
to
be
found
;
a
place
much
changed
in
feature
and
in
fortune
,
yet
with
some
relish
of
ancient
greatness
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
mighty
stacks
of
chimneys
,
and
a
few
large
dark
rooms
which
had
escaped
being
walled
and
subdivided
out
of
the
recognition
of
their
old
proportions
,
gave
the
Yard
a
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
inhabited
by
poor
people
,
who
set
up
their
rest
among
its
faded
glories
,
as
Arabs
of
the
desert
pitch
their
tents
among
the
fallen
stones
of
the
Pyramids
;
but
there
was
a
family
sentimental
feeling
prevalent
in
the
Yard
,
that
it
had
a
character
.
   
<EOS>
As
if
the
aspiring
city
had
become
puffed
up
in
the
very
ground
on
which
it
stood
,
the
ground
had
so
risen
about
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
that
you
got
into
it
down
a
flight
of
steps
which
formed
no
part
of
the
original
approach
,
and
got
out
of
it
by
a
low
gateway
into
a
maze
of
shabby
streets
,
which
went
about
and
about
,
tortuously
ascending
to
the
level
again
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
end
of
the
Yard
and
over
the
gateway
,
was
the
factory
of
Daniel
Doyce
,
often
heavily
beating
like
a
bleeding
heart
of
iron
,
with
the
clink
of
metal
upon
metal
.
<EOS>
The
opinion
of
the
Yard
was
divided
respecting
the
derivation
of
its
name
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
practical
of
its
inmates
abided
by
the
tradition
of
a
murder
;
the
gentler
and
more
imaginative
inhabitants
,
including
the
whole
of
the
tender
sex
,
were
loyal
to
the
legend
of
a
young
lady
of
former
times
closely
imprisoned
in
her
chamber
by
a
cruel
father
for
remaining
true
to
her
own
true
love
,
and
refusing
to
marry
the
suitor
he
chose
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
legend
related
how
that
the
young
lady
used
to
be
seen
up
at
her
window
behind
the
bars
,
murmuring
a
love
-
lorn
song
of
which
the
burden
was
,
"
Bleeding
Heart
,
Bleeding
Heart
,
bleeding
away
,
"
until
she
died
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
objected
by
the
murderous
party
that
this
Refrain
was
notoriously
the
invention
of
a
tambour
-
worker
,
a
spinster
and
romantic
,
still
lodging
in
the
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
forasmuch
as
all
favourite
legends
must
be
associated
with
the
affections
,
and
as
many
more
people
fall
in
love
than
commit
murder
---
which
it
may
be
hoped
,
howsoever
bad
we
are
,
will
continue
until
the
end
of
the
world
to
be
the
dispensation
under
which
we
shall
live
---
the
Bleeding
Heart
,
Bleeding
Heart
,
bleeding
away
story
,
carried
the
day
by
a
great
majority
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
party
would
listen
to
the
antiquaries
who
delivered
learned
lectures
in
the
neighbourhood
,
showing
the
Bleeding
Heart
to
have
been
the
heraldic
cognisance
of
the
old
family
to
whom
the
property
had
once
belonged
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
considering
that
the
hour
-
glass
they
turned
from
year
to
year
was
filled
with
the
earthiest
and
coarsest
sand
,
the
Bleeding
Heart
Yarders
had
reason
enough
for
objecting
to
be
despoiled
of
the
one
little
golden
grain
of
poetry
that
sparkled
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
Down
in
to
the
Yard
,
by
way
of
the
steps
,
came
Daniel
Doyce
,
Mr
Meagles
,
and
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
along
the
Yard
,
and
between
the
open
doors
on
either
hand
,
all
abundantly
garnished
with
light
children
nursing
heavy
ones
,
they
arrived
at
its
opposite
boundary
,
the
gateway
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Arthur
Clennam
stopped
to
look
about
him
for
the
domicile
of
Plornish
,
plasterer
,
whose
name
,
according
to
the
custom
of
Londoners
,
Daniel
Doyce
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
to
that
hour
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
plain
enough
,
nevertheless
,
as
Little
Dorrit
had
said
;
over
a
lime
-
splashed
gateway
in
the
corner
,
within
which
Plornish
kept
a
ladder
and
a
barrel
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
house
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
which
she
had
described
as
his
place
of
habitation
,
was
a
large
house
,
let
off
to
various
tenants
;
but
Plornish
ingeniously
hinted
that
he
lived
in
the
parlour
,
by
means
of
a
painted
hand
under
his
name
,
the
forefinger
of
which
hand
(
on
which
the
artist
had
depicted
a
ring
and
a
most
elaborate
nail
of
the
genteelest
form
)
referred
all
inquirers
to
that
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
Parting
from
his
companions
,
after
arranging
another
meeting
with
Mr
Meagles
,
Clennam
went
alone
into
the
entry
,
and
knocked
with
his
knuckles
at
the
parlour
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
opened
presently
by
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
,
whose
unoccupied
hand
was
hastily
rearranging
the
upper
part
of
her
dress
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
Mrs
Plornish
,
and
this
maternal
action
was
the
action
of
Mrs
Plornish
during
a
large
part
of
her
waking
existence
.
   
<EOS>
Was
Mr
Plornish
at
home
?
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
a
civil
woman
,
"
not
to
deceive
you
,
he
's
gone
to
look
for
a
job
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to
deceive
you
"
was
a
method
of
speech
with
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
deceive
you
,
under
any
circumstances
,
as
little
as
might
be
;
but
she
had
a
trick
of
answering
in
this
provisional
form
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
will
be
back
soon
,
if
I
wait
for
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
expecting
him
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
this
half
an
hour
,
at
any
minute
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
Walk
in
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Arthur
entered
the
rather
dark
and
close
parlour
(
though
it
was
lofty
too
)
,
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
she
placed
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to
deceive
you
,
sir
,
I
notice
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
and
I
take
it
kind
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
she
meant
;
and
by
expressing
as
much
in
his
looks
,
elicited
her
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
many
that
comes
into
a
poor
place
,
that
deems
it
worth
their
while
to
move
their
hats
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
people
think
more
of
it
than
people
think
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
returned
,
with
an
uncomfortable
feeling
in
so
very
slight
a
courtesy
being
unusual
,
Was
that
all
!
 
<EOS>
And
stooping
down
to
pinch
the
cheek
of
another
young
child
who
was
sitting
on
the
floor
,
staring
at
him
,
asked
Mrs
Plornish
how
old
that
fine
boy
was
?
   
<EOS>
"
Four
year
just
turned
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
IS
a
fine
little
fellow
,
ai
n't
he
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
But
this
one
is
rather
sickly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
tenderly
hushed
the
baby
in
her
arms
,
as
she
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
mind
my
asking
if
it
happened
to
be
a
job
as
you
was
come
about
,
sir
,
would
you
?
"
asked
Mrs
Plornish
wistfully
.
   
<EOS>
She
asked
it
so
anxiously
,
that
if
he
had
been
in
possession
of
any
kind
of
tenement
,
he
would
have
had
it
plastered
a
foot
deep
rather
than
answer
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
obliged
to
answer
No
;
and
he
saw
a
shade
of
disappointment
on
her
face
,
as
she
checked
a
sigh
,
and
looked
at
the
low
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
saw
,
also
,
that
Mrs
Plornish
was
a
young
woman
,
made
somewhat
slatternly
in
herself
and
her
belongings
by
poverty
;
and
so
dragged
at
by
poverty
and
the
children
together
,
that
their
united
forces
had
already
dragged
her
face
into
wrinkles
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
such
things
as
jobs
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
seems
to
me
to
have
gone
underground
,
they
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Herein
Mrs
Plornish
limited
her
remark
to
the
plastering
trade
,
and
spoke
without
reference
to
the
Circumlocution
Office
and
the
Barnacle
Family
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
so
difficult
to
get
work
?
"
asked
Arthur
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Plornish
finds
it
so
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
quite
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
Really
he
is
.
"
<EOS>
Really
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
many
wayfarers
on
the
road
of
life
,
who
seem
to
be
afflicted
with
supernatural
corns
,
rendering
it
impossible
for
them
to
keep
up
even
with
their
lame
competitors
.
   
<EOS>
A
willing
,
working
,
soft
hearted
,
not
hard
-
headed
fellow
,
Plornish
took
his
fortune
as
smoothly
as
could
be
expected
;
but
it
was
a
rough
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
so
rarely
happened
that
anybody
seemed
to
want
him
,
it
was
such
an
exceptional
case
<EOS>
when
his
powers
were
in
any
request
,
that
his
misty
mind
could
not
make
out
how
it
happened
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
as
it
came
,
therefore
;
he
tumbled
into
all
kinds
of
difficulties
,
and
tumbled
out
of
them
;
and
,
by
tumbling
through
life
,
got
himself
considerably
bruised
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
for
want
of
looking
after
jobs
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
lifting
up
her
eyebrows
,
and
searching
for
a
solution
of
the
problem
between
the
bars
of
the
grate
;
"
nor
yet
for
want
of
working
at
them
when
they
are
to
be
got
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
ever
heard
my
husband
complain
of
work
.
"
   
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
,
this
was
the
general
misfortune
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
there
were
public
complaints
,
pathetically
going
about
,
of
labour
being
scarce
---
which
certain
people
seemed
to
take
extraordinarily
ill
,
as
though
they
had
an
absolute
right
to
it
on
their
own
terms
---
but
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
though
as
willing
a
Yard
as
any
in
Britain
,
was
never
the
better
for
the
demand
.
<EOS>
That
high
old
family
,
the
Barnacles
,
had
long
been
too
busy
with
their
great
principle
to
look
into
the
matter
;
and
indeed
the
matter
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
watchfulness
in
out
-
generalling
all
other
high
old
families
except
the
Stiltstalkings
.
   
<EOS>
While
Mrs
Plornish
spoke
in
these
words
of
her
absent
lord
,
her
lord
returned
.
 
<EOS>
A
smooth
-
cheeked
,
fresh
-
coloured
,
sandy
-
whiskered
man
of
thirty
.
 
<EOS>
Long
in
the
legs
,
yielding
at
the
knees
,
foolish
in
the
face
,
flannel
-
jacketed
,
lime
-
whitened
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
Plornish
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
,
"
said
Clennam
,
rising
,
"
to
beg
the
favour
of
a
little
conversation
with
you
on
the
subject
of
the
Dorrit
family
.
"
   
<EOS>
Plornish
became
suspicious
.
 
<EOS>
Seemed
to
scent
a
creditor
.
 
<EOS>
Said
,
"
Ah
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Well
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
know
what
satisfaction
he
could
give
any
gentleman
,
respecting
that
family
.
 
<EOS>
What
might
it
be
about
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
better
,
"
said
Clennam
,
smiling
,
"
than
you
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
   
Plornish
observed
,
not
Smiling
in
return
,
And
yet
he
had
n't
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
the
gentleman
,
neither
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
I
know
your
kind
offices
at
second
hand
,
but
on
the
best
authority
;
through
Little
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
---
I
mean
,
"
he
explained
,
"
Miss
Dorrit
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
heard
of
you
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
of
you
,
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Please
to
sit
down
again
,
Sir
,
and
consider
yourself
welcome
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
Plornish
,
taking
a
chair
,
and
lifting
the
elder
child
upon
his
knee
,
that
he
might
have
the
moral
support
of
speaking
to
a
stranger
over
his
head
,
"
I
have
been
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
Lock
myself
,
and
in
that
way
we
come
to
know
Miss
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Me
and
my
wife
<EOS>
,
we
are
well
acquainted
with
Miss
Dorrit
.
"
<EOS>
"
Intimate
!
"
cried
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
was
so
proud
of
the
acquaintance
,
that
she
had
awakened
some
bitterness
of
spirit
in
the
Yard
by
magnifying
to
an
enormous
amount
the
sum
for
which
Miss
Dorrit
's
father
had
become
insolvent
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bleeding
Hearts
resented
her
claiming
to
know
people
of
such
distinction
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
her
father
that
I
got
acquainted
with
first
.
 
<EOS>
And
through
getting
acquainted
with
him
,
you
see
---
why
---
I
got
acquainted
with
her
,
"
said
Plornish
tautologically
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
And
there
's
manners
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
polish
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
gentleman
to
have
run
to
seed
in
the
Marshalsea
jail
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
,
"
said
Plornish
,
lowering
his
voice
,
and
speaking
with
a
perverse
admiration
of
what
he
ought
to
have
pitied
or
despised
,
"
not
aware
that
Miss
Dorrit
and
her
sister
dursn't
<EOS>
let
him
know
that
they
work
for
a
living
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
"
said
Plornish
,
looking
with
a
ridiculous
triumph
first
at
his
wife
,
and
then
all
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dursn't
let
him
know
it
,
they
dursn't
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Without
admiring
him
for
that
,
"
Clennam
quietly
observed
,
"
I
am
very
sorry
for
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
remark
appeared
to
suggest
to
Plornish
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
it
might
not
be
a
very
fine
trait
of
character
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
pondered
about
it
for
a
moment
,
and
gave
it
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
me
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
certainly
Mr
Dorrit
is
as
affable
with
me
,
I
am
sure
,
as
I
can
possibly
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Considering
the
differences
and
distances
<EOS>
betwixt
us
,
more
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
Miss
Dorrit
that
we
were
speaking
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
how
did
you
introduce
her
at
my
mother
's
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Plornish
picked
a
bit
of
lime
out
of
his
whisker
,
put
it
between
his
lips
,
turned
it
with
his
tongue
like
a
sugar
-
plum
,
considered
,
found
himself
unequal
to
the
task
of
lucid
explanation
,
and
appealing
to
his
wife
,
said
,
"
Sally
,
you
may
as
well
mention
how
it
was
,
old
woman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dorrit
,
"
said
Sally
,
hushing
the
baby
from
side
to
side
,
and
laying
her
chin
upon
the
little
hand
as
it
tried
to
disarrange
the
gown
again
,
"
came
here
one
afternoon
with
a
bit
of
writing
,
telling
that
how
she
wished
for
needlework
,
and
asked
if
it
would
be
considered
any
ill
-
conwenience
in
case
she
was
to
give
her
address
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
(
Plornish
repeated
,
her
address
here
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
he
were
making
responses
at
church
.
)
<EOS>
"
Me
and
Plornish
says
,
No
,
Miss
Dorrit
,
no
ill
-
conwenience
,
"
(
Plornish
repeated
,
no
ill
-
conwenience
,
)
"
and
she
wrote
it
in
,
according
.
 
<EOS>
Which
then
me
and
Plornish
says
,
Ho
Miss
Dorrit
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
Plornish
repeated
,
Ho
Miss
Dorrit
.
)
<EOS>
"
Have
you
thought
of
copying
it
three
or
four
times
,
as
the
way
to
make
it
known
in
more
places
than
one
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
says
Miss
Dorrit
,
I
have
not
,
but
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
She
copied
it
out
according
,
on
this
table
,
in
a
sweet
writing
,
and
Plornish
,
he
took
it
where
he
worked
,
having
a
job
just
then
,
"
(
Plornish
repeated
job
just
then
,
)
"
and
likewise
to
the
landlord
of
the
Yard
;
through
which
it
was
that
Mrs
Clennam
first
happened
to
employ
Miss
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Plornish
repeated
,
employ
Miss
Dorrit
;
and
Mrs
Plornish
having
come
to
an
end
,
feigned
to
bite
the
fingers
of
the
little
hand
as
she
kissed
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
landlord
of
the
Yard
,
"
said
Arthur
Clennam
,
"
is
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
Mr
Casby
,
by
name
,
he
is

"
said
Plornish
,
"
and
Pancks
,
he
collects
the
rents
.
 
<EOS>
That
<EOS>
,
"
added
Mr
Plornish
,
dwelling
on
the
subject
with
a
slow
thoughtfulness
that
appeared
to
have
no
connection
with
any
specific
object
,
and
to
lead
him
nowhere
,
"
that
is
about
what
they
are
,
you
may
believe
me
or
not
,
as
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
?
"
returned
Clennam
,
thoughtful
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Casby
,
too
!
<EOS>
An
old
acquaintance
of
mine
,
long
ago
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Plornish
did
not
see
his
road
to
any
comment
on
this
fact
,
and
made
none
.
 
<EOS>
As
there
truly
was
no
reason
why
he
should
have
the
least
interest
in
it
,
Arthur
Clennam
went
on
to
the
present
purport
of
his
visit
;
namely
,
to
make
Plornish
the
instrument
of
effecting
Tip
's
release
,
with
as
little
detriment
as
possible
to
the
self
-
reliance
and
self
-
helpfulness
of
the
young
man
,
supposing
him
to
possess
any
remnant
of
those
qualities
:
without
doubt
a
very
wide
stretch
of
supposition
.
 
<EOS>
Plornish
,
having
been
made
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
action
from
the
Defendant
's
own
mouth
,
gave
Arthur
to
understand
that
the
Plaintiff
was
a
"
Chaunter
"
---
<EOS>
meaning
,
not
a
singer
of
anthems
,
but
a
seller
of
horses
---
and
that
he
(
Plornish
)
considered
that
ten
shillings
in
the
pound
"
would
settle
handsome
,
"
and
that
more
would
be
a
waste
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
Principal
and
instrument
soon
drove
off
together
to
a
stable
-
yard
in
High
Holborn
,
where
a
remarkably
fine
grey
gelding
,
worth
,
at
the
lowest
figure
,
seventy
-
five
guineas
(
not
taking
into
account
the
value
of
the
shot
he
had
been
made
to
swallow
for
the
improvement
of
his
form
)
,
was
to
be
parted
with
for
a
twenty
-
pound
note
,
in
consequence
of
his
having
run
away
last
week
with
Mrs
Captain
Barbary
of
Cheltenham
,
who
was
n't
up
to
a
horse
of
his
courage
,
and
who
,
in
mere
spite
,
insisted
on
selling
him
for
that
ridiculous
sum
:
or
,
in
other
words
,
on
giving
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
Plornish
,
going
up
this
yard
alone
and
leaving
his
Principal
outside
,
found
a
gentleman
with
tight
drab
legs
,
a
rather
old
hat
,
a
little
hooked
stick
,
and
a
blue
neckerchief
(
Captain
Maroon
of
Gloucestershire
,
a
private
friend
of
Captain
Barbary
)
;
who
happened
to
be
there
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
to
mention
these
little
circumstances
concerning
the
remarkably
fine
grey
gelding
to
any
real
judge
of
a
horse
and
quick
snapper
-
up
of
a
good
thing
,
who
might
look
in
at
that
address
as
per
advertisement
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
happening
also
to
be
the
Plaintiff
in
the
Tip
case
,
referred
Mr
Plornish
to
his
solicitor
,
and
declined
to
treat
with
Mr
Plornish
,
or
even
to
endure
his
presence
in
the
yard
,
unless
he
appeared
there
with
a
twenty
-
pound
note
:
in
which
case
only
,
the
gentleman
would
augur
from
appearances
that
he
meant
business
,
and
might
be
induced
to
talk
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
hint
,
Mr
Plornish
retired
to
communicate
with
his
Principal
,
and
presently
came
back
with
the
required
credentials
.
<EOS>
Then
said
Captain
Maroon
,
"
Now
,
how
much
time
do
you
want
to
make
the
other
twenty
in
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
'll
give
you
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
said
Captain
Maroon
,
when
that
would
n't
suit
,
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
what
I
'll
do
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
get
me
a
good
bill
at
four
months
,
made
payable
at
a
banking
-
house
,
for
the
other
twenty
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
said
Captain
Maroon
,
when
THAT
would
n't
suit
,
"
Now
,
come
;
Here
's
the
last
I
've
got
to
say
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
give
me
another
ten
down
,
and
I
'll
run
my
pen
clean
through
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
said
Captain
Maroon
when
THAT
would
n't
suit
,
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
and
this
shuts
it
up
;
he
has
used
me
bad
,
but
I
'll
let
him
off
for
another
five
down
and
a
bottle
of
wine
;
and
if
you
mean
done
,
say
done
,
and
if
you
do
n't
like
it
,
leave
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Finally
said
Captain
Maroon
,
when
THAT
would
n't
suit
either
,
"
Hand
over
,
then
!
"
<EOS>
---
And
in
consideration
of
the
first
offer
,
gave
a
receipt
in
full
and
discharged
the
prisoner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Plornish
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
I
trust
to
you
,
if
you
please
,
to
keep
my
secret
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
undertake
to
let
the
young
man
know
that
he
is
free
,
and
to
tell
him
that
you
were
employed
to
compound
for
the
debt
by
some
one
whom
you
are
not
at
liberty
to
name
,
you
will
not
only
do
me
a
service
,
but
may
do
him
one
,
and
his
sister
also
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
last
reason
,
sir
,
"
said
Plornish
,
"
would
be
quite
sufficient
.
<EOS>
Your
wishes
shall
be
attended
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
Friend
has
obtained
his
discharge
,
you
can
say
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
A
Friend
who
hopes
that
for
his
sister
's
sake
,
if
for
no
one
else
's
,
he
will
make
good
use
of
his
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
wishes
,
sir
,
shall
be
attended
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
will
be
so
good
,
in
your
better
knowledge
of
the
family
,
as
to
communicate
freely
with
me
,
and
to
point
out
to
me
any
means
by
which
you
think
I
may
be
delicately
and
really
useful
to
Little
Dorrit
,
I
shall
feel
under
an
obligation
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
name
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
Plornish
,
"
it
'll
be
ekally
a
pleasure
<EOS>
an

it'l
be
ekally
a
pleasure
and
a

"
Finding
himself
unable
to
balance
his
sentence
after
two
efforts
,
Mr
Plornish
wisely
dropped
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
Clennam
's
card
and
appropriate
pecuniary
compliment
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
earnest
to
finish
his
commission
at
once
,
and
his
Principal
was
in
the
same
mind
.
 
<EOS>
So
his
Principal
offered
to
set
him
down
at
the
Marshalsea
Gate
,
and
they
drove
in
that
direction
over
Blackfriars
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
way
,
Arthur
elicited
from
his
new
friend
a
confused
summary
of
the
interior
life
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
They
was
all
hard
up
there
,
Mr
Plornish
said
,
uncommon
hard
up
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
he
could
n't
say
how
it
was
;
he
did
n't
know
as
anybody
could
say
how
it
was
;
all
he
know'd
was
,
that
so
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
When
a
man
felt
,
on
his
own
back
and
in
his
own
belly
,
that
poor
he
was
,
that
man
<EOS>
(
Mr
Plornish
gave
it
as
his
decided
belief
)
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
well
that
he
was
poor
somehow
or
another
,
and
you
could
n't
talk
it
out
of
him
,
no
more
than
you
could
talk
Beef
into
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
you
see
,
some
people
as
was
better
off
said
,
and
a
good
many
such
people
lived
pretty
close
up
to
the
mark
themselves
if
not
beyond
it
<EOS>
so
he
'd
heerd
,
that
they
was
"
improvident
"
<EOS>
(
that
was
the
favourite
word
)
down
the
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
if
they
see
a
man
with
his
wife
and
children
going
to
Hampton
Court
in
a
Wan
,
perhaps
once
in
a
year
,
they
says
,
"
Hallo
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
was
poor
,
my
improvident
friend
!
"
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Lord
,
how
hard
it
was
upon
a
man
!
 
<EOS>
What
was
a
man
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
go
mollancholy
mad
,
and
even
if
he
did
,
you
would
n't
be
the
better
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
Mr
Plornish
's
judgment
you
would
be
the
worse
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
you
seemed
to
want
to
make
a
man
mollancholy
mad
.
 
<EOS>
You
was
always
at
it
---
if
not
with
your
right
hand
,
with
your
left
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
they
a
doing
in
the
Yard
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
take
a
look
at
'em
and
see
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
girls
and
their
mothers
a
working
at
their
sewing
,
or
their
shoe
-
binding
,
or
their
trimming
,
or
their
waistcoat
making
,
day
and
night
and
night
and
day
,
and
not
more
than
able
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
after
all
---
often
not
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
people
of
pretty
well
all
sorts
of
trades
you
could
name
,
all
wanting
to
work
,
and
yet
not
able
to
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
old
people
,
after
working
all
their
lives
,
going
and
being
shut
up
in
the
workhouse
,
much
worse
fed
and
lodged
and
treated
altogether
,
than
<EOS>
---
Mr
Plornish
said
manufacturers
,
but
appeared
to
mean
malefactors
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
a
man
did
n't
know
where
to
turn
himself
for
a
crumb
of
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
who
was
to
blame
for
it
,
Mr
Plornish
did
n't
know
who
was
to
blame
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
tell
you
who
suffered
,
but
he
could
n't
tell
you
whose
fault
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
n't
HIS
place
to
find
out
,
and
who
'd
mind
what
he
said
,
if
he
did
find
out
?
 
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
only
know'd
<EOS>
that
it
was
n't
put
right
by
them
<EOS>
what
undertook
that
line
of
business
,
and
that
it
did
n't
come
right
of
itself
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
in
brief
,
his
illogical
opinion
was
,
that
if
you
could
n't
do
nothing
for
him
,
you
had
better
take
nothing
from
him
for
doing
of
it
;
so
far
as
he
could
make
out
,
that
was
about
what
it
come
to
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
in
a
prolix
,
gently
-
growling
,
foolish
way
,
did
Plornish
turn
the
tangled
skein
of
his
estate
about
and
about
,
like
a
blind
man
who
was
trying
to
find
some
beginning
or
end
to
it
;
until
they
reached
the
prison
gate
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
he
left
his
Principal
alone
;
to
wonder
,
as
he
rode
away
,
how
many
thousand
Plornishes
there
might
be
within
a
day
or
two
's
journey
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
playing
sundry
curious
variations
on
the
same
tune
,
which
were
not
known
by
ear
in
that
glorious
institution
.

<EOS>
Patriarchal
 
<EOS>
The
mention
of
Mr
Casby
again
revived
in
Clennam
's
memory
the
smouldering
embers
of
curiosity
and
interest
which
Mrs
Flintwinch
had
fanned
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
Casby
had
been
the
beloved
of
his
boyhood
;
and
Flora
was
the
daughter
and
only
child
of
wooden
-
headed
old
Christopher
<EOS>
(
so
he
was
still
occasionally
spoken
of
by
some
irreverent
spirits
who
had
had
dealings
with
him
,
and
in
whom
familiarity
had
bred
its
proverbial
result
perhaps
)
,
who
was
reputed
to
be
rich
in
weekly
tenants
,
and
to
get
a
good
quantity
of
blood
out
of
the
stones
of
several
unpromising
courts
and
alleys
.
<EOS>
After
some
days
of
inquiry
and
research
,
Arthur
Clennam
became
convinced
that
the
case
of
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
was
indeed
a
hopeless
one
,
and
sorrowfully
resigned
the
idea
of
helping
him
to
freedom
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
hopeful
inquiry
to
make
at
present
,
concerning
Little
Dorrit
either
;
but
he
argued
with
himself
that
it
might
---
for
anything
he
knew
---
it
might
be
serviceable
to
the
poor
child
,
if
he
renewed
this
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
beyond
all
doubt
he
would
have
presented
himself
at
Mr
Casby
's
door
,
if
there
had
been
no
Little
Dorrit
in
existence
;
for
we
all
know
how
we
all
deceive
ourselves
---
<EOS>
that
is
to
say
,
how
people
in
general
,
our
profounder
selves
excepted
,
deceive
themselves
---
as
to
motives
of
action
.
   
<EOS>
With
a
comfortable
impression
upon
him
,
and
quite
an
honest
one
in
its
way
,
that
he
was
still
patronising
Little
Dorrit
in
doing
what
had
no
reference
to
her
,
he
found
himself
one
afternoon
at
the
corner
of
Mr
Casby
's
street
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Casby
lived
in
a
street
in
the
Gray
's
Inn
Road
,
which
had
set
off
from
that
thoroughfare
with
the
intention
of
running
at
one
heat
down
into
the
valley
,
and
up
again
to
the
top
of
Pentonville
Hill
;
but
which
had
run
itself
out
of
breath
in
twenty
yards
,
and
had
stood
still
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
such
place
in
that
part
now
;
but
it
remained
there
for
many
years
,
looking
with
a
baulked
countenance
at
the
wilderness
patched
with
unfruitful
gardens
and
pimpled
with
eruptive
summerhouses
,
that
it
had
meant
to
run
over
in
no
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
house
,
"
thought
Clennam
,
as
he
crossed
to
the
door
,
"
is
as
little
changed
as
my
mother
's
,
and
looks
almost
as
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
likeness
ends
outside
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
its
staid
repose
within
.
 
<EOS>
The
smell
of
its
jars
of
old
rose
-
leaves
and
lavender
seems
to
come
upon
me
even
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
his
knock
at
the
bright
brass
knocker
of
obsolete
shape
brought
a
woman
-
servant
to
the
door
,
those
faded
scents
in
truth
saluted
him
like
wintry
breath
that
had
a
faint
remembrance
in
it
of
the
bygone
spring
.
 
<EOS>
He
stepped
into
the
sober
,
silent
,
air
-
tight
house
---
one
might
have
fancied
it
to
have
been
stifled
by
Mutes
in
the
Eastern
manner
---
and
the
door
,
closing
again
,
seemed
to
shut
out
sound
and
motion
.
 
<EOS>
The
furniture
was
formal
,
grave
,
and
quaker
-
like
,
but
well
-
kept
;
and
had
as
prepossessing
an
aspect
as
anything
,
from
a
human
creature
to
a
wooden
stool
,
that
is
meant
for
much
use
and
is
preserved
for
little
,
can
ever
wear
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
grave
clock
,
ticking
somewhere
up
the
staircase
;
and
there
was
a
songless
bird
in
the
same
direction
,
pecking
at
his
cage
,
as
if
he
were
ticking
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
parlour
-
fire
ticked
in
the
grate
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
person
on
the
parlour
-
hearth
,
and
the
loud
watch
in
his
pocket
ticked
audibly
.
   
<EOS>
The
servant
-
maid
had
ticked
the
two
words
"
Mr
Clennam
"
so
softly
that
she
had
not
been
heard
;
and
he
consequently
stood
,
within
the
door
she
had
closed
,
unnoticed
.
 
<EOS>
The
figure
of
a
man
advanced
in
life
,
whose
smooth
grey
eyebrows
seemed
to
move
to
the
ticking
as
the
fire
-
light
flickered
on
them
,
sat
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
with
his
list
shoes
on
the
rug
,
and
his
thumbs
slowly
revolving
over
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
old
Christopher
Casby
---
recognisable
at
a
glance
---
as
unchanged
in
twenty
years
and
upward
as
his
own
solid
furniture
---
as
little
touched
by
the
influence
of
the
varying
seasons
as
the
old
rose
-
leaves
and
old
lavender
in
his
porcelain
jars
.
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
never
was
a
man
,
in
this
troublesome
world
,
so
troublesome
for
the
imagination
to
picture
as
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
had
changed
very
little
in
his
progress
through
life
.
 
<EOS>
Confronting
him
,
in
the
room
in
which
he
sat
,
was
a
boy
's
portrait
,
which
anybody
seeing
him
would
have
identified
as
Master
Christopher
Casby
,
aged
ten
:
though
disguised
with
a
haymaking
rake
,
for
which
he
had
had
,
at
any
time
,
as
much
taste
or
use
as
for
a
diving
-
bell
;
and
sitting
(
on
one
of
his
own
legs
)
upon
a
bank
of
violets
,
moved
to
precocious
contemplation
by
the
spire
of
a
village
church
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
same
smooth
face
and
forehead
,
the
same
calm
blue
eye
,
the
same
placid
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
shining
bald
head
,
which
looked
so
very
large
because
it
shone
so
much
;
and
the
long
grey
hair
at
its
sides
and
back
,
like
floss
silk
or
spun
glass
,
which
looked
so
very
benevolent
because
it
was
never
cut
;
were
not
,
of
course
,
to
be
seen
in
the
boy
as
in
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
in
the
Seraphic
creature
with
the
haymaking
rake
,
were
clearly
to
be
discerned
the
rudiments
of
the
Patriarch
with
the
list
shoes
.
   
<EOS>
Patriarch
was
the
name
which
many
people
delighted
to
give
him
.
<EOS>
Various
old
ladies
in
the
neighbourhood
spoke
of
him
as
The
Last
of
the
Patriarchs
.
 
<EOS>
So
grey
,
so
slow
,
so
quiet
,
so
impassionate
,
so
very
bumpy
in
the
head
,
Patriarch
was
the
word
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
accosted
in
the
streets
,
and
respectfully
solicited
to
become
a
Patriarch
for
painters
and
for
sculptors
;
with
so
much
importunity
,
in
sooth
,
that
it
would
appear
to
be
beyond
the
Fine
Arts
to
remember
the
points
of
a
Patriarch
,
or
to
invent
one
.
<EOS>
Philanthropists
of
both
sexes
had
asked
who
he
was
,
and
on
being
informed
,
"
Old
Christopher
Casby
,
formerly
Town
-
agent
to
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
,
"
had
cried
in
a
rapture
of
disappointment
,
"
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
with
that
head
,
is
he
not
a
benefactor
to
his
species
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
with
that
head
,
is
he
not
a
father
to
the
orphan
and
a
friend
to
the
friendless
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
head
,
however
,
he
remained
old
Christopher
Casby
,
proclaimed
by
common
report
rich
in
house
property
;
and
with
that
head
,
he
now
sat
in
his
silent
parlour
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
would
be
the
height
of
unreason
to
expect
him
to
be
sitting
there
without
that
head
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
moved
to
attract
his
attention
,
and
the
grey
eyebrows
turned
towards
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
<EOS>
I
fear
you
did
not
hear
me
announced
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
wish
to
see
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wished
to
pay
my
respects
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Casby
seemed
a
feather
's
weight
disappointed
by
the
last
words
,
having
perhaps
prepared
himself
for
the
visitor
's
wishing
to
pay
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
the
pleasure
,
sir
,
"
he
proceeded
---
"
take
a
chair
<EOS>
,
if
you
please
---
have
I
the
pleasure
of
knowing
---
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
truly
,
yes
,
I
think
I
have
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
am
not
mistaken
in
supposing
that
I
am
acquainted
with
those
features
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
address
a
gentleman
of
whose
return
to
this
country
<EOS>
I
was
informed
by
Mr
Flintwinch
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
your
present
visitor
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
other
,
Mr
Casby
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
have
you
been
since
we
met
?
"
   
<EOS>
Without
thinking
it
worth
while
to
explain
that
in
the
course
of
some
quarter
of
a
century
he
had
experienced
occasional
slight
fluctuations
in
his
health
and
spirits
,
Clennam
answered
generally
that
he
had
never
been
better
,
or
something
equally
to
the
purpose
;
and
shook
hands
with
the
possessor
of
"
that
head
"
as
it
shed
its
patriarchal
light
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
older
,
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
Christopher
Casby
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
---
not
younger
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
wise
remark
he
felt
that
he
was
scarcely
shining
with
brilliancy
,
and
became
aware
that
he
was
nervous
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
your
respected
father
,
"
said
Mr
Casby
,
"
is
no
more
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
grieved
to
hear
it
,
Mr
Clennam
,
I
was
grieved
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
replied
in
the
usual
way
that
he
felt
infinitely
obliged
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
time
,
"
said
Mr
Casby
,
"
when
your
parents
and
myself
were
not
on
friendly
terms
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
family
misunderstanding
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
Your
respected
mother
was
rather
jealous
of
her
son
,
maybe
;
when
I
say
her
son
,
I
mean
your
worthy
self
,
your
worthy
self
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
smooth
face
had
a
bloom
upon
it
like
ripe
wall
-
fruit
.
 
<EOS>
What
with
his
blooming
face
,
and
that
head
,
and
his
blue
eyes
,
he
seemed
to
be
delivering
sentiments
of
rare
wisdom
and
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
In
like
manner
,
his
physiognomical
expression
seemed
to
teem
with
benignity
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
could
have
said
where
the
wisdom
was
,
or
where
the
virtue
was
,
or
where
the
benignity
was
;
but
they
all
seemed
to
be
somewhere
about
him
.
"
<EOS>
Those
times
,
however
,
"
pursued
Mr
Casby
,
"
are
past
and
gone
,
past
and
gone
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
making
a
visit
to
your
respected
mother
occasionally
,
and
of
admiring
the
fortitude
and
strength
of
mind
with
which
she
bears
her
trials
,
bears
her
trials
.
<EOS>
"
 
When
he
made
one
of
these
little
repetitions
,
sitting
with
his
hands
crossed
before
him
,
he
did
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
a
gentle
smile
,
as
if
he
had
something
in
his
thoughts
too
sweetly
profound
to
be
put
into
words
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
he
denied
himself
the
pleasure
of
uttering
it
,
lest
he
should
soar
too
high
;
and
his
meekness
therefore
preferred
to
be
unmeaning
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
that
you
were
kind
enough
on
one
of
those
occasions
,
"
said
Arthur
,
catching
at
the
opportunity
as
it
drifted
past
him
,
"
to
mention
Little
Dorrit
to
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Little
---
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
seamstress
who
was
mentioned
to
me
by
a
small
tenant
of
mine
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
yes
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
You
call
her
Little
Dorrit
?
"
   
<EOS>
No
road
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
came
of
the
cross
-
cut
.
 
<EOS>
It
led
no
further
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
Flora
,
"
said
Mr
Casby
,
"
as
you
may
have
heard
probably
,
Mr
Clennam
,
was
married
and
established
in
life
,
several
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
her
husband
when
she
had
been
married
a
few
months
.
 
<EOS>
She
resides
with
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
glad
to
see
you
,
if
you
will
permit
me
to
let
her
know
that
you
are
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
returned
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
preferred
the
request
,
if
your
kindness
had
not
anticipated
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
Mr
Casby
rose
up
in
his
list
shoes
,
and
with
a
slow
,
heavy
step
(
he
was
of
an
elephantine
build
)
,
made
for
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
long
wide
-
skirted
bottle
-
green
coat
on
,
and
a
bottle
-
green
pair
of
trousers
,
and
a
bottle
-
green
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
The
Patriarchs
were
not
dressed
in
bottle
-
green
broadcloth
,
and
yet
his
clothes
looked
patriarchal
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
left
the
room
,
and
allowed
the
ticking
to
become
audible
again
,
when
a
quick
hand
turned
a
latchkey
in
the
house
-
door
,
opened
it
,
and
shut
it
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
,
a
quick
and
eager
short
dark
man
came
into
the
room
with
so
much
way
upon
him
that
he
was
within
a
foot
of
Clennam
before
he
could
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
say
"
Halloa
!
"
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
"
said
the
short
dark
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
heard
that
anything
is
the
matter
,
"
returned
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Mr
Casby
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
short
dark
man
,
looking
about
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
be
here
directly
,
if
you
want
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
want
him
?
"
said
the
short
dark
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
This
elicited
a
word
or
two
of
explanation
from
Clennam
,
during
the
delivery
of
which
the
short
dark
man
held
his
breath
and
looked
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
black
and
rusty
iron
grey
;
had
jet
black
beads
of
eyes
;
a
scrubby
little
black
chin
;
wiry
black
hair
striking
out
from
his
head
in
prongs
,
like
forks
or
hair
-
pins
;
and
a
complexion
that
was
very
dingy
by
nature
,
or
very
dirty
by
art
,
or
a
compound
of
nature
and
art
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
dirty
hands
and
dirty
broken
nails
,
and
looked
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
coals
;
he
was
in
a
perspiration
,
and
snorted
and
sniffed
and
puffed
and
blew
,
like
a
little
labouring
steam
-
engine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
he
,
when
Arthur
told
him
how
he
came
to
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
right
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
should
ask
for
Pancks
,
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
say
that
Pancks
is
come
in
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
with
a
snort
and
a
puff
,
he
worked
out
by
another
door
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
in
the
old
days
at
home
,
certain
audacious
doubts
respecting
the
last
of
the
Patriarchs
,
which
were
afloat
in
the
air
,
had
,
by
some
forgotten
means
,
come
in
contact
with
Arthur
's
sensorium
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
aware
of
motes
and
specks
of
suspicion
in
the
atmosphere
of
that
time
;
seen
through
which
medium
,
Christopher
Casby
was
a
mere
Inn
signpost
,
without
any
Inn
---
an
invitation
to
rest
and
be
thankful
,
when
there
was
no
place
to
put
up
at
,
and
nothing
whatever
to
be
thankful
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
some
of
these
specks
even
represented
Christopher
as
capable
of
harbouring
designs
in
"
that
head
,
"
and
as
being
a
crafty
impostor
.
 
<EOS>
Other
motes
there
were
which
showed
him
as
a
heavy
,
selfish
,
drifting
Booby
,
who
,
having
stumbled
,
in
the
course
of
his
unwieldy
jostlings
against
other
men
,
on
the
discovery
that
to
get
through
life
with
ease
and
credit
,
he
had
but
to
hold
his
tongue
,
keep
the
bald
part
of
his
head
well
polished
,
and
leave
his
hair
alone
,
had
had
just
cunning
enough
to
seize
the
idea
and
stick
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
his
being
town
-
agent
to
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
was
referable
,
not
to
his
having
the
least
business
capacity
,
but
to
his
looking
so
supremely
benignant
that
nobody
could
suppose
the
property
screwed
or
jobbed
under
such
a
man
;
also
,
that
for
similar
reasons
he
now
got
more
money
out
of
his
own
wretched
lettings
,
unquestioned
,
than
anybody
with
a
less
nobby
and
less
shining
crown
could
possibly
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
it
was
represented
(
Clennam
called
to
mind
,
alone
in
the
ticking
parlour
)
that
many
people
select
their
models
,
much
as
the
painters
,
just
now
mentioned
,
select
theirs
;
and
that
,
whereas
in
the
Royal
Academy
some
evil
old
ruffian
of
a
Dog
-
stealer
will
annually
be
found
embodying
all
the
cardinal
virtues
,
on
account
of
his
eyelashes
,
or
his
chin
,
or
his
legs
(
thereby
planting
thorns
of
confusion
in
the
breasts
of
the
more
observant
students
of
nature
)
,
so
,
in
the
great
social
Exhibition
,
accessories
are
often
accepted
in
lieu
of
the
internal
character
.
   
<EOS>
Calling
these
things
to
mind
,
and
ranging
Mr
Pancks
in
a
row
with
them
,
Arthur
Clennam
leaned
this
day
to
the
opinion
,
without
quite
deciding
on
it
,
that
the
last
of
the
Patriarchs
was
the
drifting
Booby
aforesaid
,
with
the
one
idea
of
keeping
the
bald
part
of
his
head
highly
polished
:
and
that
,
much
as
an
unwieldy
ship
in
the
Thames
river
may
sometimes
be
seen
heavily
driving
with
the
tide
,
broadside
on
,
stern
first
,
in
its
own
way
and
in
the
way
of
everything
else
,
though
making
a
great
show
of
navigation
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
,
a
little
coaly
steam
-
tug
will
bear
down
upon
it
,
take
it
in
tow
,
and
bustle
off
with
it
;
similarly
the
cumbrous
Patriarch
had
been
taken
in
tow
by
the
snorting
Pancks
,
and
was
now
following
in
the
wake
of
that
dingy
little
craft
.
   
<EOS>
The
return
of
Mr
Casby
with
his
daughter
Flora
,
put
an
end
to
these
meditations
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
's
eyes
no
sooner
fell
upon
the
subject
of
his
old
passion
than
it
shivered
and
broke
to
pieces
.
   
<EOS>
Most
men
will
be
found
sufficiently
true
to
themselves
to
be
true
to
an
old
idea
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
proof
of
an
inconstant
mind
,
but
<EOS>
exactly
the
opposite
,
when
the
idea
will
not
bear
close
comparison
with
the
reality
,
and
the
contrast
is
a
fatal
shock
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
Clennam
's
case
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
youth
he
had
ardently
loved
this
woman
,
and
had
heaped
upon
her
all
the
locked
-
up
wealth
of
his
affection
and
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
That
wealth
had
been
,
in
his
desert
home
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
's
money
;
exchangeable
with
no
one
,
lying
idle
in
the
dark
to
rust
,
until
he
poured
it
out
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
since
that
memorable
time
,
though
he
had
,
until
the
night
of
his
arrival
,
as
completely
dismissed
her
from
any
association
with
his
Present
or
Future
as
if
she
had
been
dead
(
which
she
might
easily
have
been
for
anything
he
knew
)
,
he
had
kept
the
old
fancy
of
the
Past
unchanged
,
in
its
old
sacred
place
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
after
all
,
the
last
of
the
Patriarchs
coolly
walked
into
the
parlour
,
saying
in
effect
,
"
Be
good
enough
to
throw
it
down
and
dance
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
Flora
.
"
   
<EOS>
Flora
,
always
tall
,
had
grown
to
be
very
broad
too
,
and
short
of
breath
;
but
that
was
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
,
whom
he
had
left
a
lily
,
had
become
a
peony
;
but
that
was
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
,
who
had
seemed
enchanting
in
all
she
said
and
thought
,
was
diffuse
and
silly
.
<EOS>
That
was
much
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
,
who
had
been
spoiled
and
artless
long
ago
,
was
determined
to
be
spoiled
and
artless
now
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
a
fatal
blow
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
Flora
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
giggled
Flora
,
tossing
her
head
with
a
caricature
of
her
girlish
manner
,
such
as
a
mummer
might
have
presented
at
her
own
funeral
,
if
she
had
lived
and
died
in
classical
antiquity
,
"
I
am
ashamed
to
see
Mr
Clennam
,
I
am
a
mere
fright
<EOS>
,
I
know
he
'll
find
me
fearfully
changed
,
I
am
actually
an
old
woman
<EOS>
,
it
's
shocking
to
be
found
out
,
it
's
really
shocking
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
assured
her
that
she
was
just
what
he
had
expected
and
that
time
had
not
stood
still
with
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
But
with
a
gentleman
it
's
so
different
<EOS>
and
really
you
look
so
amazingly
well
that
you
have
no
right
to
say
anything
of
the
kind
,
while
,
as
to
me
,
you
know
---
oh
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Flora
with
a
little
scream
,
"
I
am
dreadful
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Patriarch
,
apparently
not
yet
understanding
his
own
part
in
the
drama
under
representation
,
glowed
with
vacant
serenity
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
if
we
talk
of
not
having
changed
,
"
said
Flora
,
who
,
whatever
she
said
,
never
once
came
to
a
full
stop
,
"
look
at
Papa
,
is
not
Papa
precisely
what
he
was
when
you
went
away
,
is
n't
it
cruel
and
unnatural
of
Papa
to
be
such
a
reproach
to
his
own
child
,
if
we
go
on
in
this
way
much
longer
people
who
do
n't
know
us
will
begin
to
suppose
that
I
am
Papa
's
Mama
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
That
must
be
a
long
time
<EOS>
hence
,
Arthur
considered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
Mr
Clennam
you
insincerest
of
creatures
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
I
perceive
already
you
have
not
lost
your
old
way
of
paying
compliments
,
your
old
way
when
you
used
to
pretend
to
be
so
sentimentally
struck
you
know
---
<EOS>
at
least
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
I
---
oh
I
do
n't
know
what
I
mean
!
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Flora
tittered
confusedly
,
and
gave
him
one
of
her
old
glances
.
   
<EOS>
The
Patriarch
,
as
if
he
now
began
to
perceive
that
his
part
in
the
piece
was
to
get
off
the
stage
as
soon
as
might
be
,
rose
,
and
went
to
the
door
by
which
Pancks
had
worked
out
,
hailing
that
Tug
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
He
received
an
answer
from
some
little
Dock
beyond
,
and
was
towed
out
of
sight
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
think
of
going
yet
,
"
said
Flora
---
<EOS>
Arthur
had
looked
at
his
hat
,
being
in
a
ludicrous
dismay
,
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
:
"
you
could
never
be
so
unkind
as
to
think
of
going
,
<EOS>
Arthur
---
<EOS>
I
mean
Mr
Arthur
---
<EOS>
or
I
suppose
Mr
Clennam
would
be
far
more
proper
---
but
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
I
am
saying
<EOS>
---
without
a
word
about
the
dear
old
days
gone
for
ever
,
when
I
come
to
think
of
it
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
would
be
much
better
not
to
speak
of
them
<EOS>
and
it
's
highly
probable
that
you
have
some
much
more
agreeable
engagement
and
pray
let
Me
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
interfere
with
it
though
there
was
a
time
,
but
I
am
running
into
nonsense
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
Flora
could
have
been
such
a
chatterer
in
the
days
she
referred
to
?
 
<EOS>
Could
there
have
been
anything
like
her
present
disjointed
volubility
in
the
fascinations
that
had
captivated
him
?
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
have
little
doubt
,
"
said
Flora
,
running
on
with
astonishing
speed
,
and
pointing
her
conversation
with
nothing
but
commas
,
and
very
few
of
them
,
"
that
you
are
married
to
some
Chinese
lady
,
being
in
China
so
long
and
being
in
business
and
naturally
desirous
to
settle
and
extend
your
connection
<EOS>
nothing
was
more
likely
than
that
you
should
propose
to
a
Chinese
lady
and
nothing
was
more
natural
<EOS>
I
am
sure
than
that
the
Chinese
lady
should
accept
you
and
think
herself
very
well
off
too
<EOS>
,
I
only
hope
she
's
not
a
Pagodian
dissenter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
,
"
married
to
any
lady
,
Flora
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
good
gracious
me
<EOS>
I
hope
you
never
kept
yourself
a
bachelor
so
long
on
my
account
!
"
<EOS>
tittered
Flora
<EOS>
;
"
but
of
course
you
never
did
why
should
you
,
pray
do
n't
answer
,
I
do
n't
know
where
I
'm
running
to
,
oh
do
tell
me
something
about
the
Chinese
ladies
whether
their
eyes
are
really
so
long
and
narrow
always
putting
me
in
mind
of
mother
-
of
-
pearl
fish
at
cards
and
do
they
really
wear
tails
down
their
back
and
plaited
too
or
is
it
only
the
men
,
and
when
they
pull
their
hair
so
very
tight
off
their
foreheads
<EOS>
do
n't
they
hurt
themselves
,
and
why
do
they
stick
little
bells
all
over
their
bridges
and
temples
and
hats
and
things
or
do
n't
they
really
do
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
Flora
gave
him
another
of
her
old
glances
.
 
<EOS>
Instantly
she
went
on
again
,
as
if
he
had
spoken
in
reply
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
it
's
all
true
and
they
really
do
!
 
<EOS>
good
gracious
Arthur
!
<EOS>
---
pray
excuse
me
---
<EOS>
old
habit
---
Mr
Clennam
far
more
proper
---
what
a
country
to
live
in
for
so
long
a
time
,
and
with
so
many
lanterns
and
umbrellas
too
how
very
dark
and
wet
the
climate
ought
to
be
and
no
doubt
actually
is
,
and
the
sums
of
money
that
must
be
made
by
those
two
trades
where
everybody
carries
them
and
hangs
them
everywhere
,
the
little
shoes
too
and
the
feet
screwed
back
in
infancy
<EOS>
is
quite
surprising
,
what
a
traveller
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
his
ridiculous
distress
,
Clennam
received
another
of
the
old
glances
without
in
the
least
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
dear
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
only
to
think
of
the
changes
at
home
Arthur
---
can
not
overcome
it
,
and
seems
so
natural
,
Mr
Clennam
far
more
proper
---
since
you
became
familiar
with
the
Chinese
customs
and
language
which
I
am
persuaded
you
speak
like
a
Native
if
not
better
for
you
were
always
quick
and
clever
though
immensely
difficult
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
I
am
sure
the
tea
chests
alone
would
kill
me
if
I
tried
,
such
changes
<EOS>
Arthur
---
I
am
doing
it
again
,
seems
so
natural
,
most
improper
---
as
no
one
could
have
believed
,
who
could
have
ever
imagined
Mrs
Finching
when
I
ca
n't
imagine
it
myself
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
married
name
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Arthur
,
struck
,
in
the
midst
of
all
this
,
by
a
certain
warmth
of
heart
that
expressed
itself
in
her
tone
when
she
referred
,
however
oddly
,
to
the
youthful
relation
in
which
they
had
stood
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
"
Finching
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Finching
<EOS>
oh
yes
is
n't
it
a
dreadful
name
,
but
as
Mr
F
said
when
he
proposed
to
me
which
he
did
seven
times
and
handsomely
consented
<EOS>
I
must
say
to
be
what
he
used
to
call
on
liking
twelve
months
,
after
all
,
he
was
n't
answerable
for
it
and
could
n't
help
it
could
he
,
Excellent
man
,
not
at
all
like
you
but
excellent
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
Flora
had
at
last
talked
herself
out
of
breath
for
one
moment
.
 
<EOS>
One
moment
;
for
she
recovered
breath
in
the
act
of
raising
a
minute
corner
of
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
her
eye
,
as
a
tribute
to
the
ghost
of
the
departed
Mr
F
,
and
began
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
could
dispute
,
Arthur
---
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
---
that
it
's
quite
right
<EOS>
you
should
be
formally
friendly
to
me
under
the
altered
circumstances
and
indeed
you
could
n't
be
anything
else
,
at
least
I
suppose
not
you
ought
to
know
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
recalling
that
there
was
a
time
when
things
were
very
different
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs
Finching
,
"
Arthur
began
,
struck
by
the
good
tone
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
not
that
nasty
ugly
name
,
say
Flora
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Flora
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Flora
,
I
am
happy
in
seeing
you
once
more
,
and
in
finding
that
,
like
me
,
you
have
not
forgotten
the
old
foolish
dreams
,
when
we
saw
all
before
us
in
the
light
of
our
youth
and
hope
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
seem
so
,
"
pouted
Flora
,
"
you
take
it
very
coolly
,
but
<EOS>
however
I
know
you
are
disappointed
in
me
,
I
suppose
the
Chinese
ladies
---
Mandarinesses
if
you
call
them
so

are
the
cause

<EOS>
perhaps
I
am
the
cause

myself

just

likely

"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
Clennam
entreated
,
"
do
n't
say
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
I
must
you
know

said
Flora

in
a
positive
tone

what
nonsense
not
to

very
well

"
   
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
her
rapidity
,
she
had
found
that
out
with
the
quick
perception
of
a
cleverer
woman
.
 
<EOS>
The
inconsistent
and
profoundly
unreasonable
way
in
which
she
instantly
went
on
,
nevertheless
,
to
interweave
their
long
-
abandoned
boy
and
girl
relations
with
their
present
interview
,
made
Clennam
feel
as
if
he
were
light
-
headed
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
remark

"
said
Flora
,
giving
their
conversation
,
without
the
slightest
notice
and
to
the
great
terror
of
Clennam
,
the
tone
of
a
love

quarrel
,
"
I
wish
to
make

one
explanation

when
your

made
a
scene

when
I

called
down
into

little
breakfast

room
where
they
were
looking
at

parasol
between

seated
on

what
was
I
to

<EOS>
"
My

urged
Clennam

all

myself
right

My

you

gently

One
more
remark

proceeded
Flora
with
unslackened
volubility
,
"
I
wish
to
make
,
one
more
explanation

five
days

had
a
cold
in

crying

I
passed
entirely
in

there
is
the

room
still
on

still
at

my

dreary

a
lull

he
was
all
attention
he
called
next
day

he
soon
began
to
call
three
evenings
a

to
send
in
little
things
for
supper
it
was
not
love
on
Mr
F

part

it
was
adoration

proposed
with

full
approval
of

what
could

do

<EOS>

Nothing

<EOS>
what
you
did

One
last
remark

proceeded
Flora

rejecting

life

a
wave
of

hand

is
always
tiresome
and
putting
in
his
nose
everywhere
where
he
is
not
wanted
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
and
with
a
hasty
gesture
fraught
with
timid
caution
---
such
a
gesture
had
Clennam
's
eyes
been
familiar
with
in
the
old
time
---
poor
Flora
left
herself
at
eighteen
years
of
age
,
a
long
long
way
behind
again
;
and
came
to
a
full
stop
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
Or
rather
,
she
left
about
half
of
herself
at
eighteen
years
of
age
behind
,
and
grafted
the
rest
on
to
the
relict
of
the
late
Mr
F
;
thus
making
a
moral
mermaid
of
herself
,
which
her
once
boy
-
lover
contemplated
with
feelings
wherein
his
sense
of
the
sorrowful
and
his
sense
of
the
comical
were
curiously
blended
.
   
<EOS>
For
example
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
there
were
a
secret
understanding
between
herself
and
Clennam
of
the
most
thrilling
nature
;
as
if
the
first
of
a
train
of
post
-
chaises
and
four
,
extending
all
the
way
to
Scotland
,
were
at
that
moment
round
the
corner
;
and
as
if
she
could
n't
(
and
would
n't
)
have
walked
into
the
Parish
Church
with
him
,
under
the
shade
of
the
family
umbrella
,
with
the
Patriarchal
blessing
on
her
head
,
and
the
perfect
concurrence
of
all
mankind
;
Flora
comforted
her
soul
with
agonies
of
mysterious
signalling
,
expressing
dread
of
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
sensation
of
becoming
more
and
more
light
-
headed
every
minute
,
Clennam
saw
the
relict
of
the
late
Mr
F
enjoying
herself
in
the
most
wonderful
manner
,
by
putting
herself
and
him
in
their
old
places
,
and
going
through
all
the
old
performances
---
now
,
when
the
stage
was
dusty
,
when
the
scenery
was
faded
,
when
the
youthful
actors
were
dead
,
when
the
orchestra
was
empty
,
when
the
lights
were
out
.
 
<EOS>
And
still
,
through
all
this
grotesque
revival
of
what
he
remembered
as
having
once
been
prettily
natural
to
her
,
he
could
not
but
feel
that
it
revived
at
sight
of
him
,
and
that
there
was
a
tender
memory
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
Patriarch
insisted
on
his
staying
to
dinner
,
and
Flora
signalled
"
Yes
!
"
 
<EOS>
Clennam
so
wished
he
could
have
done
more
than
stay
to
dinner
---
so
heartily
wished
he
could
have
found
the
Flora
that
had
been
,
or
that
never
had
been
---
that
he
thought
the
least
atonement
he
could
make
for
the
disappointment
he
almost
felt
ashamed
of
,
was
to
give
himself
up
to
the
family
desire
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
he
stayed
to
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
Pancks
dined
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Pancks
steamed
out
of
his
little
dock
at
a
quarter
before
six
,
and
bore
straight
down
for
the
Patriarch
,
who
happened
to
be
then
driving
,
in
an
inane
manner
,
through
a
stagnant
account
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
Pancks
instantly
made
fast
to
him
and
hauled
him
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
?
"
said
Pancks
,
with
a
puff
and
a
snort
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
troublesome
property
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
pay
you
badly
,
but
rents
are
very
hard
to
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
more
trouble
with
that
one
place
than
with
all
the
places
belonging
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
just
as
the
big
ship
in
tow
gets
the
credit
,
with
most
spectators
,
of
being
the
powerful
object
,
so
the
Patriarch
usually
seemed
to
have
said
himself
whatever
Pancks
said
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
"
returned
Clennam
,
upon
whom
this
impression
was
so
efficiently
made
by
a
mere
gleam
of
the
polished
head
that
he
spoke
the
ship
instead
of
the
Tug
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
people
are
so
poor
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
say
,
you
know
,
"
snorted
Pancks
,
taking
one
of
his
dirty
hands
out
of
his
rusty
iron
-
grey
pockets
to
bite
his
nails
,
if
he
could
find
any
,
and
turning
his
beads
of
eyes
upon
his
employer
,
"
whether
they
're
poor
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
they
are
,
but
they
all
say
that
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
man
says
he
's
rich
,
you
're
generally
sure
he
is
n't
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
they
ARE
poor
,
you
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
be
poor
yourself
if
you
did
n't
get
your
rents
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
enough
,
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
going
to
keep
open
house
for
all
the
poor
of
London
,
"
pursued
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
going
to
lodge
'em
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
're
not
going
to
open
your
gates
wide
and
let
'em
come
free
.
<EOS>
Not
if
you
know
it
,
you
ai
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Casby
shook
his
head
,
in
Placid
and
benignant
generality
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
a
man
takes
a
room
of
you
at
half
-
a
-
crown
a
week
,
and
when
the
week
comes
round
has
n't
got
the
half
-
crown
,
you
say
to
that
man
,
Why
have
you
got
the
room
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
n't
got
the
one
thing
,
why
have
you
got
the
other
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
been
and
done
with
your
money
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
up
to
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
YOU
say
to
a
man
of
that
sort
;
and
if
you
did
n't
say
it
,
more
shame
for
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
here
made
a
singular
and
startling
noise
,
produced
by
a
strong
blowing
effort
in
the
region
of
the
nose
,
unattended
by
any
result
but
<EOS>
that
acoustic
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
some
extent
of
such
property
about
the
east
and
north
-
east
here
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Clennam
,
doubtful
which
of
the
two
to
address
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
pretty
well
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
particular
to
east
or
north
-
east
,
any
point
of
the
compass
will
do
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
want
is
a
good
investment
and
a
quick
return
.
 
<EOS>
You
take
it
where
you
can
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
nice
as
to
situation
---
not
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
fourth
and
most
original
figure
in
the
Patriarchal
tent
,
who
also
appeared
before
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
an
amazing
little
old
woman
,
with
a
face
like
a
staring
wooden
doll
too
cheap
for
expression
,
and
a
stiff
yellow
wig
perched
unevenly
on
the
top
of
her
head
,
as
if
the
child
who
owned
the
doll
had
driven
a
tack
through
it
anywhere
,
so
that
it
only
got
fastened
on
.
 
<EOS>
Another
remarkable
thing
in
this
little
old
woman
was
,
that
the
same
child
seemed
to
have
damaged
her
face
in
two
or
three
places
with
some
blunt
instrument
in
the
nature
of
a
spoon
;
her
countenance
,
and
particularly
the
tip
of
her
nose
,
presenting
the
phenomena
of
several
dints
,
generally
answering
to
the
bowl
of
that
article
.
 
<EOS>
A
further
remarkable
thing
in
this
little
old
woman
was
,
that
she
had
no
name
<EOS>
but
Mr
F
's
Aunt
.
   
<EOS>
She
broke
upon
the
visitor
's
view
under
the
following
circumstances
:
Flora
said
when
the
first
dish
was
being
put
on
the
table
,
perhaps
Mr
Clennam
might
not
have
heard
that
Mr
F
had
left
her
a
legacy
?
 
<EOS>
Clennam
in
return
implied
his
hope
that
Mr
F
had
endowed
the
wife
whom
he
adored
,
with
the
greater
part
of
his
worldly
substance
,
if
not
with
all
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
said
,
oh
yes
,
she
did
n't
mean
that
,
Mr
F
had
made
a
beautiful
will
,
but
he
had
left
her
as
a
separate
legacy
,
his
Aunt
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
went
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
the
legacy
,
and
,
on
her
return
,
rather
triumphantly
presented
"
Mr
F
's
Aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
major
characteristics
discoverable
by
the
stranger
in
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
were
extreme
severity
and
grim
taciturnity
;
sometimes
interrupted
by
a
propensity
to
offer
remarks
in
a
deep
warning
voice
,
which
,
being
totally
uncalled
for
by
anything
said
by
anybody
,
and
traceable
to
no
association
of
ideas
,
confounded
and
terrified
the
Mind
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
may
have
thrown
in
these
observations
on
some
system
of
her
own
,
and
it
may
have
been
ingenious
,
or
even
subtle
:
but
the
key
to
it
was
wanted
.
<EOS>
The
neatly
-
served
and
well
-
cooked
dinner
(
for
everything
about
the
Patriarchal
household
promoted
quiet
digestion
)
began
with
some
soup
,
some
fried
soles
,
a
butter
-
boat
of
shrimp
sauce
,
and
a
dish
of
potatoes
.
 
<EOS>
The
conversation
still
turned
on
the
receipt
of
rents
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
after
regarding
the
company
for
ten
minutes
with
a
malevolent
gaze
,
delivered
the
following
fearful
remark
:
   
<EOS>
"
When
we
lived
at
Henley
,
Barnes
's
gander
was
stole
by
tinkers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
courageously
nodded
his
head
and
said
,
"
All
right
,
ma'am
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
effect
of
this
mysterious
communication
upon
Clennam
was
absolutely
to
frighten
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
another
circumstance
invested
this
old
lady
with
peculiar
terrors
.
 
<EOS>
Though
she
was
always
staring
,
she
never
acknowledged
that
she
saw
any
individual
.
   
<EOS>
The
polite
and
attentive
stranger
would
desire
,
say
,
to
consult
her
inclinations
on
the
subject
of
potatoes
.
 
<EOS>
His
expressive
action
would
be
hopelessly
lost
upon
her
,
and
what
could
he
do
?
 
<EOS>
No
man
could
say
,
"
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
will
you
permit
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
Every
man
retired
from
the
spoon
,
as
Clennam
did
,
cowed
and
baffled
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
mutton
,
a
steak
,
and
an
apple
-
pie
---
nothing
in
the
remotest
way
connected
with
ganders
---
and
the
dinner
went
on
like
a
disenchanted
feast
,
as
it
truly
was
.
 
<EOS>
Once
upon
a
time
Clennam
had
sat
at
that
table
taking
no
heed
of
anything
<EOS>
but
Flora
<EOS>
;
now
the
principal
heed
he
took
of
Flora
was
to
observe
,
against
his
will
,
that
she
was
very
fond
of
porter
,
that
she
combined
a
great
deal
of
sherry
with
sentiment
,
and
that
if
she
were
a
little
overgrown
,
it
was
upon
substantial
grounds
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
of
the
Patriarchs
had
always
been
a
mighty
eater
,
and
he
disposed
of
an
immense
quantity
of
solid
food
with
the
benignity
of
a
good
soul
who
was
feeding
some
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
who
was
always
in
a
hurry
,
and
who
referred
at
intervals
to
a
little
dirty
notebook
which
he
kept
beside
him
(
perhaps
containing
the
names
of
the
defaulters
he
meant
to
look
up
by
way
of
dessert
)
,
took
in
his
victuals
much
as
if
he
were
coaling
;
with
a
good
deal
of
noise
,
a
good
deal
of
dropping
about
,
and
a
puff
and
a
snort
occasionally
,
as
if
he
were
nearly
ready
to
steam
away
.
   
<EOS>
All
through
dinner
,
Flora
combined
her
present
appetite
for
eating
and
drinking
with
her
past
appetite
for
romantic
love
,
in
a
way
that
made
Clennam
afraid
to
lift
his
eyes
from
his
plate
;
since
he
could
not
look
towards
her
without
receiving
some
glance
of
mysterious
meaning
or
warning
,
as
if
they
were
engaged
in
a
plot
.
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
sat
silently
defying
him
with
an
aspect
of
the
greatest
bitterness
,
until
the
removal
of
the
cloth
and
the
appearance
of
the
decanters
,
when
she
originated
another
observation
---
struck
into
the
conversation
like
a
clock
,
without
consulting
anybody
.
   
<EOS>
Flora
had
just
said
,
"
Mr
Clennam
,
will
you
give
me
a
glass
of
port
for
Mr
F
's
Aunt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Monument
near
London
Bridge
,
"
<EOS>
that
lady
instantly
proclaimed
,
"
was
put
up
arter
<EOS>
the
Great
Fire
of
London
;
and
the
Great
Fire
of
London
was
not
the
fire
in
which
your
uncle
George
's
workshops
was
burned
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
with
his
former
courage
,
said
,
"
Indeed
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
All
right
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
appearing
to
be
incensed
by
imaginary
contradiction
,
or
other
ill
-
usage
,
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
instead
of
relapsing
into
silence
,
made
the
following
additional
proclamation
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
hate
a
fool
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
imparted
to
this
sentiment
,
in
itself
almost
Solomonic
,
so
extremely
injurious
and
personal
a
character
by
levelling
it
straight
at
the
visitor
's
head
,
that
it
became
necessary
to
lead
Mr
F
's
Aunt
from
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
quietly
done
by
Flora
;
Mr
F
's
Aunt
offering
no
resistance
,
but
inquiring
on
her
way
out
,
"
What
he
come
there
for
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
with
implacable
animosity
.
   
<EOS>
When
Flora
returned
,
she
explained
that
her
legacy
was
a
clever
old
lady
,
but
was
sometimes
a
little
singular
,
and
"
took
dislikes
"
---
peculiarities
of
which
Flora
seemed
to
be
proud
rather
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
As
Flora
's
good
nature
shone
in
the
case
,
Clennam
had
no
fault
to
find
with
the
old
lady
for
eliciting
it
,
now
that
he
was
relieved
from
the
terrors
of
her
presence
;
and
they
took
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Foreseeing
then
that
the
Pancks
would
shortly
get
under
weigh
,
and
that
the
Patriarch
would
go
to
sleep
<EOS>
,
he
pleaded
the
necessity
of
visiting
his
mother
,
and
asked
Mr
Pancks
in
which
direction
he
was
going
?
   
<EOS>
"
Citywards
,
sir
,
"
said
Pancks
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
walk
together
?
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
agreeable
,
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Flora
was
murmuring
in
rapid
snatches
for
his
ear
,
that
there
was
a
time
and
that
the
past
was
a
yawning
gulf
however
and
that
a
golden
chain
no
longer
bound
him
and
that
she
revered
the
memory
of
the
late
Mr
F
and
that
she
should
be
at
home
to
-
morrow
at
half
-
past
one
and
that
the
decrees
of
Fate
were
beyond
recall
and
that
she
considered
nothing
so
improbable
as
that
he
ever
walked
on
the
north
-
west
side
of
Gray's
-
Inn
Gardens
at
exactly
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
at
parting
to
give
his
hand
in
frankness
to
the
existing
Flora
---
not
the
vanished
Flora
,
or
the
mermaid
---
but
Flora
would
n't
have
it
,
could
n't
have
it
,
was
wholly
destitute
of
the
power
of
separating
herself
and
him
from
their
bygone
characters
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
the
house
miserably
enough
;
and
so
much
more
light
-
headed
than
ever
,
that
if
it
had
not
been
his
good
fortune
to
be
towed
away
,
he
might
,
for
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
,
have
drifted
anywhere
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
began
to
come
to
himself
,
in
the
cooler
air
and
the
absence
of
Flora
,
he
found
Pancks
at
full
speed
,
cropping
such
scanty
pasturage
of
nails
as
he
could
find
,
and
snorting
at
intervals
.
<EOS>
These
,
in
conjunction
with
one
hand
in
his
pocket
and
his
roughened
hat
hind
side
before
,
were
evidently
the
conditions
under
which
he
reflected
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
fresh
night
!
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
's
pretty
fresh
,
"
assented
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
a
stranger
you
feel
the
climate
more
than
I
do
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
have
n't
got
time
to
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
lead
such
a
busy
life
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
always
some
of
'em
to
look
up
,
or
something
to
look
after
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
like
business
,
"
said
Pancks
,
getting
on
a
little
faster
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
a
man
made
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
nothing
else
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
Pancks
put
the
counter
question
,
"
What
else
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
packed
up
,
in
the
smallest
compass
,
a
weight
that
had
rested
on
Clennam
's
life
;
and
he
made
no
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
ask
our
weekly
tenants
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
of
'em
will
pull
long
faces
to
me
,
and
say
,
Poor
as
you
see
us
,
master
,
we
're
always
grinding
,
drudging
,
toiling
,
every
minute
we
're
awake
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
to
them
,
What
else
are
you
made
for
?
 
<EOS>
It
shuts
them
up
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
n't
a
word
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
What
else
are
you
made
for
?
 
<EOS>
That
clinches
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
dear
,
dear
,
dear
!
"
sighed
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
am
I
,
"
said
Pancks
,
pursuing
his
argument
with
the
weekly
tenant
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
else
do
you
suppose
I
think
I
am
made
for
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Rattle
me
out
of
bed
early
,
set
me
going
,
give
me
as
short
a
time
as
you
like
to
bolt
my
meals
in
,
and
keep
me
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
me
always
at
it
,
and
I
'll
keep
you
always
at
it
,
you
keep
somebody
else
always
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
you
are
with
the
Whole
Duty
of
Man
in
a
commercial
country
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
When
they
had
walked
a
little
further
in
silence
,
Clennam
said
:
"
Have
you
no
taste
for
anything
,
Mr
Pancks
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
taste
?
"
<EOS>
drily
retorted
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
say
inclination
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
inclination
to
get
money
,
sir
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
if
you
will
show
me
how
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
blew
off
that
sound
again
,
and
it
occurred
to
his
companion
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
his
way
of
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
singular
man
in
all
respects
;
he
might
not
have
been
quite
in
earnest
,
but
that
the
short
,
hard
,
rapid
manner
in
which
he
shot
out
these
cinders
of
principles
,
as
if
it
were
done
by
mechanical
revolvency
,
seemed
irreconcilable
with
banter
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
no
great
reader
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
read
anything
but
letters
and
accounts
.
 
<EOS>
Never
collect
anything
but
advertisements
relative
to
next
of
kin
.
 
<EOS>
If
that
's
a
taste
,
I
have
got
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
not
of
the
Clennams
of
Cornwall
,
Mr
Clennam
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
ever
heard
of
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
're
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
your
mother
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
too
much
character
to
let
a
chance
escape
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Supposing
<EOS>
I
had
been
of
the
Clennams
of
Cornwall
?
"
<EOS>
"
You
'd
have
heard
of
something
to
your
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
little
enough
to
my
advantage
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
Cornish
property
going
a
begging
,
sir
,
and
not
a
Cornish
Clennam
to
have
it
for
the
asking
,
"
said
Pancks
,
taking
his
notebook
from
his
breast
pocket
and
putting
it
in
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
turn
off
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Tug
,
suddenly
lightened
,
and
untrammelled
by
having
any
weight
in
tow
,
was
already
puffing
away
into
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
crossed
Smithfield
together
,
and
Clennam
was
left
alone
at
the
corner
of
Barbican
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
intention
of
presenting
himself
in
his
mother
's
dismal
room
that
night
,
and
could
not
have
felt
more
depressed
and
cast
away
if
he
had
been
in
a
wilderness
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
slowly
down
Aldersgate
Street
,
and
was
pondering
his
way
along
towards
Saint
Paul
's
,
purposing
to
come
into
one
of
the
great
thoroughfares
for
the
sake
of
their
light
and
life
,
when
a
crowd
of
people
flocked
towards
him
on
the
same
pavement
,
and
he
stood
aside
against
a
shop
to
let
them
pass
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
came
up
,
he
made
out
that
they
were
gathered
around
a
something
that
was
carried
on
men
's
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
saw
that
it
was
a
litter
,
hastily
made
of
a
shutter
or
some
such
thing
;
and
a
recumbent
figure
upon
it
,
and
the
scraps
of
conversation
in
the
crowd
,
and
a
muddy
bundle
carried
by
one
man
,
and
a
muddy
hat
carried
by
another
,
informed
him
that
an
accident
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
The
litter
stopped
under
a
lamp
before
it
had
passed
him
half
-
a
-
dozen
paces
,
for
some
readjustment
of
the
burden
;
and
,
the
crowd
stopping
too
,
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
array
.
   
<EOS>
"
An
accident
going
to
the
Hospital
?
"
he
asked
an
old
man
beside
him
,
who
stood
shaking
his
head
,
inviting
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
along
of
them
Mails
.
 
<EOS>
They
ought
to
be
prosecuted
and
fined
,
<EOS>
them
Mails
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
a
racing
out
of
Lad
Lane
and
Wood
Street
at
twelve
or
fourteen
mile
a
hour
,
them
Mails
do
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
wonder
is
,
that
people
ai
n't
killed
oftener
by
them
Mails
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
person
is
not
killed
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
!
"
said
the
man
,
"
it
an't
for
the
want
of
a
will
in
them
<EOS>
Mails
,
if
he
an't
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
speaker
having
folded
his
arms
,
and
set
in
comfortably
to
address
his
depreciation
of
them
Mails
to
any
of
the
bystanders
who
would
listen
,
several
voices
,
out
of
pure
sympathy
with
the
sufferer
,
confirmed
him
;
one
voice
saying
to
Clennam
,
"
They
're
a
public
nuisance
,
them
Mails
,
sir
;
"
another
,
"
I
see
one
on
'em
pull
up
within
half
a
inch
of
a
boy
,
last
night
;
"
another
,
"
I
see
one
on
'em
go
over
a
cat
,
sir
---
and
it
might
have
been
your
own
mother
;
"
and
all
representing
,
by
implication
,
that
if
he
happened
to
possess
any
public
influence
,
he
could
not
use
it
better
than
against
them
Mails
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
a
native
Englishman
is
put
to
it
every
night
of
his
life
,
to
save
his
life
from
them
Mails
,
"
argued
the
first
old
man
;
"
and
he
knows
when
they
're
a
coming
round
the
corner
,
to
tear
him
limb
from
limb
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
you
expect
from
a
poor
foreigner
who
do
n't
know
nothing
about
'
em
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
this
a
foreigner
?
"
said
Clennam
,
leaning
forward
to
look
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
such
replies
as
"
Frenchman
,
sir
,
"
"
Porteghee
,
sir
,
"
"
Dutchman
,
sir
,
"
"
Prooshan
,
sir
,
"
and
other
conflicting
testimony
,
he
now
heard
a
feeble
voice
asking
,
both
in
Italian
and
in
French
,
for
water
.
 
<EOS>
A
general
remark
going
round
,
in
reply
,
of
"
Ah
,
poor
fellow
<EOS>
,
he
says
he
'll
never
get
over
it
;
and
no
wonder
!
"
 
<EOS>
Clennam
begged
to
be
allowed
to
pass
,
as
he
understood
the
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
handed
to
the
front
,
to
speak
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
First
,
he
wants
some
water
,
"
said
he
,
looking
round
.
 
<EOS>
(
A
dozen
good
fellows
dispersed
to
get
it
.
)
<EOS>
"
Are
you
badly
hurt
,
my
friend
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
the
man
on
the
litter
,
in
Italian
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
;
yes
,
yes
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
my
leg
,
it
's
my
leg
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
pleases
me
to
hear
the
old
music
,
though
I
am
very
bad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
traveller
!
 
<EOS>
Stay
!
 
<EOS>
See
,
the
water
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
give
you
some
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
had
rested
the
litter
on
a
pile
of
paving
stones
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
a
convenient
height
from
the
ground
,
and
by
stooping
he
could
lightly
raise
the
head
with
one
hand
and
hold
the
glass
to
his
lips
with
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
,
muscular
,
brown
man
,
with
black
hair
and
white
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
A
lively
face
,
apparently
.
 
<EOS>
Earrings
in
his
ears
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
traveller
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
stranger
in
this
city
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
surely
,
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
arrived
this
unhappy
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
From
what
country
?
"
<EOS>
"
Marseilles
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
see
there
!
 
<EOS>
I
also
!
 
<EOS>
Almost
as
much
a
stranger
here
as
you
,
though
born
here
,
I
came
from
Marseilles
a
little
while
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
cast
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
face
looked
up
at
him
imploringly
,
as
he
rose
from
wiping
it
,
and
gently
replaced
the
coat
that
covered
the
writhing
figure
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
leave
you
till
you
shall
be
well
taken
care
of
.
 
<EOS>
Courage
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
very
much
better
half
an
hour
hence
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Altro
,
Altro
!
"
cried
the
poor
little
man
,
in
a
faintly
incredulous
tone
;
and
as
they
took
him
up
,
hung
out
his
right
hand
to
give
the
forefinger
a
back
-
handed
shake
in
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
turned
;
and
walking
beside
the
litter
,
and
saying
an
encouraging
word
now
and
then
,
accompanied
it
to
the
neighbouring
hospital
of
Saint
Bartholomew
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
the
crowd
but
the
bearers
and
he
being
admitted
,
the
disabled
man
was
soon
laid
on
a
table
in
a
cool
,
methodical
way
,
and
carefully
examined
by
a
surgeon
who
was
as
near
at
hand
,
and
as
ready
to
appear
as
Calamity
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
hardly
knows
an
English
word
,
"
said
Clennam
;
"
is
he
badly
hurt
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
know
all
about
it
first
,
"
said
the
surgeon
,
continuing
his
examination
with
a
businesslike
delight
in
it
,
"
before
we
pronounce
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
trying
the
leg
with
a
finger
,
and
two
fingers
,
and
one
hand
and
two
hands
,
and
over
and
under
,
and
up
and
down
,
and
in
this
direction
and
in
that
,
and
approvingly
remarking
on
the
points
of
interest
to
another
gentleman
who
joined
him
,
the
surgeon
at
last
clapped
the
patient
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
,
"
He
wo
n't
hurt
.
<EOS>
He
'll
do
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
difficult
enough
,
but
we
shall
not
want
him
to
part
with
his
leg
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Which
Clennam
interpreted
to
the
patient
,
who
was
full
of
gratitude
,
and
,
in
his
demonstrative
way
,
kissed
both
the
interpreter
's
hand
and
the
surgeon
's
several
times
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
serious
injury
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
-
es
,
"
replied
the
surgeon
,
with
the
thoughtful
pleasure
of
an
artist
contemplating
the
work
upon
his
easel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
enough
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
compound
fracture
above
the
knee
,
and
a
dislocation
below
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
both
of
a
beautiful
kind
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
gave
the
patient
a
friendly
clap
on
the
shoulder
again
,
as
if
he
really
felt
that
he
was
a
very
good
fellow
indeed
,
and
worthy
of
all
commendation
for
having
broken
his
leg
in
a
manner
interesting
to
science
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
speaks
French
?
"
said
the
surgeon
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
he
speaks
French
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
at
no
loss
here
,
then
.
<EOS>
---
You
have
only
to
bear
a
little
pain
like
a
brave
fellow
,
my
friend
,
and
to
be
thankful
that
all
goes
as
well
as
it
does
,
"
he
added
,
in
that
tongue
,
"
and
you
'll
walk
again
to
a
marvel
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
let
us
see
whether
there
's
anything
else
the
matter
,
and
how
our
ribs
are
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
else
the
matter
,
and
our
ribs
were
sound
.
<EOS>
Clennam
remained
until
everything
possible
to
be
done
had
been
skilfully
and
promptly
done
---
the
poor
belated
wanderer
in
a
strange
land
movingly
besought
that
favour
of
him
---
and
lingered
by
the
bed
to
which
he
was
in
due
time
removed
,
until
he
had
fallen
into
a
doze
.
 
<EOS>
Even
then
he
wrote
a
few
words
for
him
on
his
card
,
with
a
promise
to
return
to
-
morrow
,
and
left
it
to
be
given
to
him
when
he
should
awake
.
<EOS>
All
these
proceedings
occupied
so
long
that
it
struck
eleven
o'clock
at
night
as
he
came
out
at
the
Hospital
Gate
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
hired
a
lodging
for
the
present
in
Covent
Garden
,
and
he
took
the
nearest
way
to
that
quarter
,
by
Snow
Hill
and
Holborn
.
   
<EOS>
Left
to
himself
again
,
after
the
solicitude
and
compassion
of
his
last
adventure
,
he
was
naturally
in
a
thoughtful
mood
.
 
<EOS>
As
naturally
,
he
could
not
walk
on
thinking
for
ten
minutes
without
recalling
Flora
.
 
<EOS>
She
necessarily
recalled
to
him
his
life
,
with
all
its
misdirection
and
little
happiness
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
got
to
his
lodging
,
he
sat
down
before
the
dying
fire
,
as
he
had
stood
at
the
window
of
his
old
room
looking
out
upon
the
blackened
forest
of
chimneys
,
and
turned
his
gaze
back
upon
the
gloomy
vista
by
which
he
had
come
to
that
stage
in
his
existence
.
<EOS>
So
long
,
so
bare
,
so
blank
.
 
<EOS>
No
childhood
;
no
youth
,
except
for
one
remembrance
;
that
one
remembrance
proved
,
only
that
day
,
to
be
a
piece
of
folly
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
misfortune
to
him
,
trifle
as
it
might
have
been
to
another
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
while
all
that
was
hard
and
stern
in
his
recollection
,
remained
Reality
on
being
proved
---
was
obdurate
to
the
sight
and
touch
,
and
relaxed
nothing
of
its
old
indomitable
grimness
---
the
one
tender
recollection
of
his
experience
would
not
bear
the
same
test
,
and
melted
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
foreseen
this
,
on
the
former
night
,
when
he
had
dreamed
with
waking
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
had
not
felt
it
then
;
and
he
had
now
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
dreamer
in
such
wise
,
because
he
was
a
man
who
had
,
deep
-
rooted
in
his
nature
,
a
belief
in
all
the
gentle
and
good
things
his
life
had
been
without
.
 
<EOS>
Bred
in
meanness
and
hard
dealing
,
this
had
rescued
him
to
be
a
man
of
honourable
mind
and
open
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Bred
in
coldness
and
severity
,
this
had
rescued
him
to
have
a
warm
and
sympathetic
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Bred
in
a
creed
too
darkly
audacious
to
pursue
,
through
its
process
of
reserving
the
making
of
man
in
the
image
of
his
Creator
to
the
making
of
his
Creator
in
the
image
of
an
erring
man
,
this
had
rescued
him
to
judge
not
,
and
in
humility
to
be
merciful
,
and
have
hope
and
charity
.
   
<EOS>
And
this
saved
him
still
from
the
whimpering
weakness
and
cruel
selfishness
of
holding
that
because
such
a
happiness
or
such
a
virtue
had
not
come
into
his
little
path
,
or
worked
well
for
him
,
therefore
it
was
not
in
the
great
scheme
,
but
was
reducible
,
when
found
in
appearance
,
to
the
basest
elements
.
 
<EOS>
A
disappointed
mind
he
had
,
but
a
mind
too
firm
and
healthy
for
such
unwholesome
air
.
<EOS>
Leaving
himself
in
the
dark
,
it
could
rise
into
the
light
,
seeing
it
shine
on
others
and
hailing
it
.
   
<EOS>
Therefore
,
he
sat
before
his
dying
fire
,
sorrowful
to
think
upon
the
way
by
which
he
had
come
to
that
night
,
yet
not
strewing
poison
on
the
way
by
which
other
men
had
come
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
should
have
missed
so
much
,
and
at
his
time
of
life
should
look
so
far
about
him
for
any
staff
to
bear
him
company
upon
his
downward
journey
and
cheer
it
<EOS>
,
was
a
just
regret
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
fire
from
which
the
blaze
departed
,
from
which
the
afterglow
subsided
,
in
which
the
ashes
turned
grey
,
from
which
they
dropped
to
dust
,
and
thought
,
"
How
soon
I
too
shall
pass
through
such
changes
,
and
be
gone
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
review
his
life
was
like
descending
a
green
tree
in
fruit
and
flower
,
and
seeing
all
the
branches
wither
and
drop
off
,
one
by
one
,
as
he
came
down
towards
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
the
unhappy
suppression
of
my
youngest
days
,
through
the
rigid
and
unloving
home
that
followed
them
,
through
my
departure
,
my
long
exile
,
my
return
,
my
mother
's
welcome
,
my
intercourse
with
her
since
,
down
to
the
afternoon
of
this
day
with
poor
Flora
,
"
said
Arthur
Clennam
,
"
what
have
I
found
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
door
was
softly
opened
,
and
these
spoken
words
startled
him
,
and
came
as
if
they
were
an
answer
:
   
"
Little
Dorrit
.
"
    
Chapter

<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
's
Party
 
Arthur
Clennam
rose
hastily
,
and
saw
her
standing
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
This
history
must
sometimes
see
with
Little
Dorrit
's
eyes
,
and
shall
begin
that
course
by
seeing
him
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
looked
into
a
dim
room
,
which
seemed
a
spacious
one
to
her
,
and
grandly
furnished
.
 
<EOS>
Courtly
ideas
of
Covent
Garden
,
as
a
place
with
famous
coffee
-
houses
,
where
gentlemen
wearing
gold
-
laced
coats
and
swords
had
quarrelled
and
fought
duels
;
costly
ideas
of
Covent
Garden
,
as
a
place
where
there
were
flowers
in
winter
at
guineas
a
-
piece
,
pine
-
apples
at
guineas
a
pound
,
and
peas
at
guineas
a
pint
;
picturesque
ideas
of
Covent
Garden
,
as
a
place
where
there
was
a
mighty
theatre
,
showing
wonderful
and
beautiful
sights
to
richly
-
dressed
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
and
which
was
for
ever
far
beyond
the
reach
of
poor
Fanny
or
poor
uncle
;
desolate
ideas
of
Covent
Garden
,
as
having
all
those
arches
in
it
,
where
the
miserable
children
in
rags
among
whom
she
had
just
now
passed
,
like
young
rats
,
slunk
and
hid
,
fed
on
offal
,
huddled
together
for
warmth
,
and
were
hunted
about
<EOS>
(
look
to
the
rats
young
and
old
,
all
ye
Barnacles
,
for
before
God
they
are
eating
away
our
foundations
,
and
will
bring
the
roofs
on
our
heads
!
)
;
teeming
ideas
of
Covent
Garden
,
as
a
place
of
past
and
present
mystery
,
romance
,
abundance
,
want
,
beauty
,
ugliness
,
fair
country
gardens
,
and
foul
street
gutters
;
all
confused
together
,
---
made
the
room
dimmer
than
it
was
in
Little
Dorrit
's
eyes
,
as
they
timidly
saw
it
from
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
in
the
chair
before
the
gone
-
out
fire
,
and
then
turned
round
wondering
to
see
her
,
was
the
gentleman
whom
she
sought
.
 
<EOS>
The
brown
,
grave
gentleman
,
who
smiled
so
pleasantly
,
who
was
so
frank
and
considerate
in
his
manner
,
and
yet
in
whose
earnestness
there
was
something
that
reminded
her
of
his
mother
,
with
the
great
difference
that
she
was
earnest
in
asperity
and
he
in
gentleness
.
<EOS>
Now
he
regarded
her
with
that
attentive
and
inquiring
look
before
which
Little
Dorrit
's
eyes
had
always
fallen
,
and
before
which
they
fell
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
poor
child
!
 
<EOS>
Here
at
midnight
?
"
   
"
I
said
Little
Dorrit
,
sir
,
on
purpose
to
prepare
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
you
must
be
very
much
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
alone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
sir
,
I
have
got
Maggy
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Considering
her
entrance
sufficiently
prepared
for
by
this
mention
of
her
name
,
Maggy
appeared
from
the
landing
outside
,
on
the
broad
grin
.
 
<EOS>
She
instantly
suppressed
that
manifestation
,
however
,
and
became
fixedly
solemn
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
have
no
fire
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
---
"
He
was
going
to
say
so
lightly
clad
,
but
stopped
himself
in
what
would
have
been
a
reference
to
her
poverty
,
saying
instead
,
"
<EOS>
And
it
is
so
cold
.
"
   
<EOS>
Putting
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
nearer
to
the
grate
,
he
made
her
sit
down
in
it
;
and
hurriedly
bringing
wood
and
coal
,
heaped
them
together
and
got
a
blaze
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
foot
is
like
marble
,
my
child
;
"
he
had
happened
to
touch
it
,
while
stooping
on
one
knee
at
his
work
of
kindling
the
fire
;
"
put
it
nearer
the
warmth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
thanked
him
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
warm
,
it
was
very
warm
!
 
<EOS>
It
smote
upon
his
heart
to
feel
that
she
hid
her
thin
,
worn
shoe
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
not
ashamed
of
her
poor
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
her
story
,
and
it
was
not
that
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
had
a
misgiving
that
he
might
blame
her
father
,
if
he
saw
them
;
that
he
might
think
,
"
why
did
he
dine
to
-
day
,
and
leave
this
little
creature
to
the
mercy
of
the
cold
stones
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
belief
that
it
would
have
been
a
just
reflection
;
she
simply
knew
,
by
experience
,
that
such
delusions
did
sometimes
present
themselves
to
people
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
part
of
her
father
's
misfortunes
that
they
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
Before
I
say
anything
else
,
"
Little
Dorrit
began
,
sitting
before
the
pale
fire
,
and
raising
her
eyes
again
to
the
face
which
in
its
harmonious
look
of
interest
,
and
pity
,
and
protection
,
she
felt
to
be
a
mystery
far
above
her
in
degree
,
and
almost
removed
beyond
her
guessing
at
;
"
may
I
tell
you
something
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
child
.
"
A
slight
shade
of
distress
fell
upon
her
,
at
his
so
often
calling
her
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
surprised
that
he
should
see
it
,
or
think
of
such
a
slight
thing
;
but
he
said
directly
:
"
I
wanted
a
tender
word
,
and
could
think
of
no
other
.
 
<EOS>
As
you
just
now
gave
yourself
the
name
they
give
you
at
my
mother
's
,
and
as
that
is
the
name
by
which
I
always
think
of
you
,
let
me
call
you
Little
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
I
should
like
it
better
than
any
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Little
Dorrit
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Little
mother
,
"
Maggy
(
who
had
been
falling
asleep
)
put
in
,
as
a
correction
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
the
same
,
MaggY
,
"
returned
Little
Dorrit
,
"
all
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
all
the
same
,
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
Maggy
laughed
,
and
immediately
snored
.
 
<EOS>
In
Little
Dorrit
's
eyes
and
ears
,
the
uncouth
figure
and
the
uncouth
sound
were
as
pleasant
as
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
glow
of
pride
in
her
big
child
,
overspreading
her
face
,
when
it
again
met
the
eyes
of
the
grave
brown
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
She
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
of
,
as
he
looked
at
Maggy
and
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
what
a
good
father
he
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
with
some
such
look
,
he
would
counsel
and
cherish
his
daughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
was
going
to
tell
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
is
,
that
MY
brother
is
at
large
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
was
rejoiced
to
hear
it
,
and
hoped
he
would
do
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
I
was
going
to
tell
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
trembling
in
all
her
little
figure
and
in
her
voice
,
"
is
,
that
I
am
not
to
know
whose
generosity
released
him
---
am
never
to
ask
,
and
am
never
to
be
told
,
and
am
never
to
thank
that
gentleman
with
all
MY
grateful
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
would
probably
need
no
thanks
,
Clennam
said
.
 
<EOS>
Very
likely
he
would
be
thankful
himself
(
and
with
reason
)
,
that
he
had
had
the
means
and
chance
of
doing
a
little
service
to
her
,
who
well
deserved
a
great
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
I
was
going
to
say
,
sir
,
is
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
trembling
more
and
more
,
"
that
if
I
knew
him
,
and
I
might
,
I
would
tell
him
that
he
can
never
,
never
know
how
I
feel
his
goodness
,
and
how
my
good
father
would
feel
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
I
was
going
to
say
,
sir
,
is
,
that
if
I
knew
him
,
and
I
might
---
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
know
him
<EOS>
and
I
must
not
<EOS>
---
I
know
that
!
<EOS>
---
I
would
tell
him
that
I
shall
never
any
more
lie
down
to
sleep
without
having
prayed
to
Heaven
to
bless
him
and
reward
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
knew
him
,
and
I
might
,
I
would
go
down
on
my
knees
to
him
,
and
take
his
hand
and
kiss
it
and
ask
him
not
to
draw
it
away
,
but
to
leave
it
---
O
to
leave
it
for
a
moment
---
and
let
my
thankful
tears
fall
on
it
;
for
I
have
no
other
thanks
to
give
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
had
put
his
hand
to
her
lips
,
and
would
have
kneeled
to
him
,
but
he
gently
prevented
her
,
and
replaced
her
in
her
chair
.
   
<EOS>
Her
eyes
,
and
the
tones
of
her
voice
,
had
thanked
him
far
better
than
she
thought
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
able
to
say
,
quite
as
composedly
as
usual
,
"
<EOS>
There
,
Little
Dorrit
,
there
,
there
,
there
!
 
<EOS>
We
will
suppose
that
you
did
know
this
person
,
and
that
you
might
do
all
this
,
and
that
it
was
all
done
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
tell
me
,
Who
am
quite
another
person
---
who
am
nothing
more
than
the
friend
who
begged
you
to
trust
him
---
why
you
are
out
at
midnight
,
and
what
it
is
that
brings
you
so
far
through
the
streets
at
this
late
hour
,
<EOS>
my
slight
,
delicate
,
"
child
was
on
his
lips
again
,
"
Little
Dorrit
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Maggy
and
I
have
been
to
-
night
,
"
she
answered
,
subduing
herself
with
the
quiet
effort
that
had
long
been
natural
to
her
,
"
to
the
theatre
where
my
sister
is
engaged
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
oh
ai
n't
it
a
Ev'nly
place
,
"
suddenly
interrupted
Maggy
,
who
seemed
to
have
the
power
of
going
to
sleep
and
waking
up
whenever
she
chose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Almost
as
good
as
a
hospital
.
 
<EOS>
Only
there
ai
n't
no
Chicking
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
she
shook
herself
,
and
fell
asleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
went
there
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
glancing
at
her
charge
,
"
because
I
like
sometimes
to
know
,
of
my
own
knowledge
,
that
my
sister
is
doing
well
;
and
like
to
see
her
there
,
with
my
own
eyes
,
when
neither
she
nor
Uncle
is
aware
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
seldom
indeed
that
I
can
do
that
,
because
when
I
am
not
out
at
work
,
I
am
with
my
father
,
and
even
when
I
am
out
at
work
,
I
hurry
home
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
pretend
to
-
night
that
I
am
at
a
party
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
made
the
confession
,
timidly
hesitating
,
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
face
,
and
read
its
expression
so
plainly
that
she
answered
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
certainly
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
at
a
party
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
paused
a
little
under
his
attentive
look
,
and
then
said
,
"
I
hope
there
is
no
harm
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
never
have
been
of
any
use
,
if
I
had
not
pretended
a
little
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
feared
that
he
was
blaming
her
in
his
mind
for
so
devising
to
contrive
for
them
,
think
for
them
,
and
watch
over
them
,
without
their
knowledge
or
gratitude
;
perhaps
even
with
their
reproaches
for
supposed
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
was
really
in
his
mind
,
was
the
weak
figure
with
its
strong
purpose
,
the
thin
worn
shoes
,
the
insufficient
dress
,
and
the
pretence
of
recreation
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
He
asked
where
the
suppositious
party
was
?
 
<EOS>
At
a
place
where
she
worked
,
answered
Little
Dorrit
,
blushing
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
said
very
little
about
it
;
only
a
few
words
to
make
her
father
easy
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
did
not
believe
it
to
be
a
grand
party
---
indeed
he
might
suppose
that
.
<EOS>
And
she
glanced
for
an
instant
at
the
shawl
she
wore
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
first
night
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
that
I
have
ever
been
away
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
London
looks
so
large
,
so
barren
,
and
so
wild
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
Little
Dorrit
's
eyes
,
its
vastness
under
the
black
sky
was
awful
;
a
tremor
passed
over
her
as
she
said
the
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
,
"
she
added
,
with
the
quiet
effort
again
,
"
what
I
have
come
to
trouble
you
with
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
sister
's
having
found
a
friend
,
a
lady
she
has
told
me
of
and
made
me
rather
anxious
about
,
was
the
first
cause
of
my
coming
away
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
being
away
,
and
coming
(
on
purpose
)
round
by
where
you
lived
and
seeing
a
light
in
the
window
---
"
   
Not
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
not
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
In
Little
Dorrit
's
eyes
,
the
outside
of
that
window
had
been
a
distant
star
on
other
nights
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
toiled
out
of
her
way
,
tired
and
troubled
,
to
look
up
at
it
,
and
wonder
about
the
grave
,
brown
gentleman
from
so
far
off
,
who
had
spoken
to
her
as
a
friend
and
protector
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
were
three
things
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
that
I
thought
I
would
like
to
say
,
if
you
were
alone
and
I
might
come
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
First
,
what
I
have
tried
to
say
,
but
never
can
---
never
shall
---
"
   
"
Hush
,
hush
!
 
<EOS>
That
is
done
with
,
and
disposed
of
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
pass
to
the
second
,
"
said
Clennam
,
smiling
her
agitation
away
,
making
the
blaze
shine
upon
her
,
and
putting
wine
and
cake
and
fruit
towards
her
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
---
"
<EOS>
this
is
the
second
thing
,
sir
<EOS>
---
I
think
Mrs
Clennam
must
have
found
out
my
secret
,
and
must
know
where
I
come
from
and
where
I
go
to
.
 
<EOS>
Where
I
live
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Indeed
!
"
returned
Clennam
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
her
,
after
short
consideration
,
why
she
supposed
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
replied
Little
Dorrit
,
"
that
Mr
Flintwinch
must
have
watched
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
why
,
Clennam
asked
,
as
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
fire
,
bent
his
brows
,
and
considered
again
;
why
did
she
suppose
that
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
met
him
twice
.
 
<EOS>
Both
times
near
home
.
 
<EOS>
Both
times
at
night
,
when
I
was
going
back
.
 
<EOS>
Both
times
I
thought
(
though
that
may
easily
be
my
mistake
)
,
that
he
hardly
looked
as
if
he
had
met
me
by
accident
.
"
<EOS>
"
Did
he
say
anything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
only
nodded
and
put
his
head
on
one
side
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
devil
take
his
head
!
"
<EOS>
mused
Clennam
,
still
looking
at
the
fire
<EOS>
;
"
it
's
always
on
one
side
.
"
<EOS>
He
roused
himself
to
persuade
her
to
put
some
wine
to
her
lips
,
and
to
touch
something
to
eat
---
it
was
very
difficult
,
she
was
so
timid
and
shy
---
and
then
said
,
musing
again
:
"
Is
my
mother
at
all
changed
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
just
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
whether
I
had
better
tell
her
my
history
.
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
whether
I
might
---
<EOS>
I
mean
,
whether
you
would
like
me
to
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
looking
at
him
in
a
suppliant
way
,
and
gradually
withdrawing
her
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
,
"
whether
you
would
advise
me
what
I
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Little
Dorrit
,
"
said
Clennam
;
and
the
phrase
had
already
begun
,
between
these
two
,
to
stand
for
a
hundred
gentle
phrases
,
according
to
the
varying
tone
and
connection
in
which
it
was
used
;
"
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
some
talk
with
my
old
friend
,
Mrs
Affery
.
 
<EOS>
Do
nothing
,
Little
Dorrit
---
except
refresh
yourself
with
such
means
as
there
are
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
you
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
I
am
not
hungry
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
as
he
softly
put
her
glass
towards
her
,
"
nor
thirsty
.
<EOS>
---
I
think
Maggy
might
like
something
,
perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
make
her
find
pockets
presently
for
all
there
is
here
,
"
said
Clennam
:
"
<EOS>
but
before
we
awake
her
,
there
was
a
third
thing
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
offended
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
promise
that
,
unreservedly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
sound
strange
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
to
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
it
unreasonable
or
ungrateful
in
me
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
with
returning
and
increasing
agitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
will
be
natural
and
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
that
I
shall
put
a
wrong
construction
on
it
,
whatever
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
coming
back
to
see
my
father
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
so
good
and
thoughtful
as
to
write
him
a
note
,
saying
that
you
are
coming
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
was
nothing
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
guess
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
folding
her
small
hands
tight
in
one
another
,
and
looking
at
him
with
all
the
earnestness
of
her
soul
looking
steadily
out
of
her
eyes
,
"
what
I
am
going
to
ask
you
not
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
may
be
wrong
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
are
not
wrong
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
we
should
want
it
so
very
,
very
badly
that
we
can
not
do
without
it
,
let
me
ask
you
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
Will
,
---
I
Will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
encourage
him
to
ask
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
understand
him
if
he
does
ask
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
give
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Save
him
and
spare
him
that
,
and
you
will
be
able
to
think
better
of
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
said
---
not
very
plainly
,
seeing
those
tears
glistening
in
her
anxious
eyes
---
that
her
wish
should
be
sacred
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
what
he
is
,
"
she
said
;
"
you
do
n't
know
what
he
really
is
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
,
seeing
him
there
all
at
once
,
dear
love
,
and
not
gradually
,
as
I
have
done
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
so
good
to
us
,
so
delicately
and
truly
good
,
that
I
want
him
to
be
better
in
your
eyes
than
in
anybody
's
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
bear
to
think
,
"
cried
Little
Dorrit
,
covering
her
tears
with
her
hands
,
"
I
can
not
bear
to
think
that
you
of
all
the
world
should
see
him
in
his
only
moments
of
degradation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
do
not
be
so
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
,
Little
Dorrit
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
quite
understood
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
tried
very
much
to
keep
myself
from
saying
this
;
I
have
thought
about
it
,
days
and
nights
;
but
when
I
knew
for
certain
you
were
coming
again
,
I
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Not
because
I
am
ashamed
of
him
,
"
she
dried
her
tears
quickly
,
"
but
because
I
know
him
better
than
any
one
does
,
and
love
him
,
and
am
proud
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Relieved
of
this
weight
<EOS>
,
Little
Dorrit
was
nervously
anxious
to
be
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
being
broad
awake
,
and
in
the
act
of
distantly
gloating
over
the
fruit
and
cakes
with
chuckles
of
anticipation
,
Clennam
made
the
best
diversion
in
his
power
by
pouring
her
out
a
glass
of
wine
,
which
she
drank
in
a
series
of
loud
smacks
;
putting
her
hand
upon
her
windpipe
after
every
one
,
and
saying
,
breathless
,
with
her
eyes
in
a
prominent
state
,
"
Oh
,
ai
n't
it
d'licious
!
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
it
hospitally
!
"
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
finished
the
wine
and
these
encomiums
,
he
charged
her
to
load
her
basket
<EOS>
(
she
was
never
without
her
basket
)
with
every
eatable
thing
upon
the
table
,
and
to
take
especial
care
to
leave
no
scrap
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
's
pleasure
in
doing
this
and
her
little
mother
's
pleasure
in
seeing
Maggy
pleased
,
was
as
good
a
turn
as
circumstances
could
have
given
to
the
late
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
gates
will
have
been
locked
long
ago
,
"
said
Clennam
,
suddenly
remembering
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
Maggy
's
lodging
,
"
answered
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
quite
safe
,
quite
well
taken
care
of
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
accompany
you
there
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
I
can
not
let
you
go
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
pray
leave
us
to
go
there
by
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
!
<EOS>
"
begged
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
so
earnest
in
the
petition
,
that
Clennam
felt
a
delicacy
in
obtruding
himself
upon
her
:
the
rather
,
because
he
could
well
understand
that
Maggy
's
lodging
was
of
the
obscurest
sort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Maggy
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
cheerily
,
"
we
shall
do
very
well
;
we
know
the
way
by
this
time
,
Maggy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
little
mother
;
we
know
the
way
,
"
chuckled
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
And
away
they
went
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
turned
at
the
door
to
say
,
"
God
bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
said
it
very
softly
,
but
perhaps
she
may
have
been
as
audible
above
---
who
knows
!
<EOS>
---
as
a
whole
cathedral
choir
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
suffered
them
to
pass
the
corner
of
the
street
before
he
followed
at
a
distance
;
not
with
any
idea
of
encroaching
a
second
time
on
Little
Dorrit
's
privacy
,
but
to
satisfy
his
mind
by
seeing
her
secure
in
the
neighbourhood
to
which
she
was
accustomed
.
 
<EOS>
So
diminutive
she
looked
,
so
fragile
and
defenceless
against
the
bleak
damp
weather
,
flitting
along
in
the
shuffling
shadow
of
her
charge
,
that
he
felt
,
in
his
compassion
,
and
in
his
habit
of
considering
her
a
child
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
rough
world
,
as
if
he
would
have
been
glad
to
take
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carry
her
to
her
journey
's
end
.
   
<EOS>
In
course
of
time
she
came
into
the
leading
thoroughfare
where
the
Marshalsea
was
,
and
then
he
saw
them
slacken
their
pace
,
and
soon
turn
down
a
by
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
felt
that
he
had
no
right
to
go
further
,
and
slowly
left
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
suspicion
that
they
ran
any
risk
of
being
houseless
until
morning
;
had
no
idea
of
the
truth
until
long
,
long
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
said
Little
Dorrit
,
when
they
stopped
at
a
poor
dwelling
all
in
darkness
,
and
heard
no
sound
on
listening
at
the
door
,
"
Now
,
this
is
a
good
lodging
for
you
,
Maggy
,
and
we
must
not
give
offence
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
we
will
only
knock
twice
,
and
not
very
loud
;
and
if
we
can
not
wake
them
so
,
we
must
walk
about
till
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Once
,
Little
Dorrit
knocked
with
a
careful
hand
,
and
listened
.
<EOS>
Twice
,
Little
Dorrit
knocked
with
a
careful
hand
,
and
listened
.
<EOS>
All
was
close
and
still
.
 
<EOS>
"
Maggy
,
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
be
patient
,
and
wait
for
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
chill
dark
night
,
with
a
damp
wind
blowing
,
when
they
came
out
into
the
leading
street
again
,
and
heard
the
clocks
strike
half
-
past
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
only
five
hours
and
a
half
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
we
shall
be
able
to
go
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
speak
of
home
,
and
to
go
and
look
at
it
,
it
being
so
near
,
was
a
natural
sequence
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
to
the
closed
gate
,
and
peeped
through
into
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
is
sound
asleep
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
kissing
one
of
the
bars
,
"
and
does
not
miss
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
gate
was
so
familiar
,
and
so
like
a
companion
,
that
they
put
down
Maggy
's
basket
in
a
corner
to
serve
for
a
seat
,
and
keeping
close
together
,
rested
there
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
street
was
empty
and
silent
,
Little
Dorrit
was
not
afraid
;
but
when
she
heard
a
footstep
at
a
distance
,
or
saw
a
moving
shadow
among
the
street
lamps
,
she
was
startled
,
and
whispered
,
"
Maggy
,
I
see
some
one
.
<EOS>
Come
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
Maggy
would
then
wake
up
more
or
less
fretfully
,
and
they
would
wander
about
a
little
,
and
come
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
As
long
as
eating
was
a
novelty
and
an
amusement
,
Maggy
kept
up
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
period
going
by
,
she
became
querulous
about
the
cold
,
and
shivered
and
whimpered
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
soon
be
over
,
dear
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
patiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
it
's
all
very
fine
for
you
,
little
mother
,
"
returned
Maggy
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
a
poor
thing
,
only
ten
years
old
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
when
the
street
was
very
still
indeed
,
Little
Dorrit
laid
the
heavy
head
upon
her
bosom
,
and
soothed
her
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
she
sat
at
the
gate
,
as
it
were
alone
;
looking
up
at
the
stars
,
and
seeing
the
clouds
pass
over
them
in
their
wild
flight
---
which
was
the
dance
at
Little
Dorrit
's
party
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
really
was
a
party
!
"
she
thought
once
,
as
she
sat
there
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
light
and
warm
and
beautiful
,
and
it
was
our
house
,
and
my
poor
dear
was
its
master
,
and
had
never
been
inside
these
walls
.
   
<EOS>
And
if
Mr
Clennam
was
one
of
our
visitors
,
and
we
were
dancing
to
delightful
music
,
and
were
all
as
gay
and
light
-
hearted
as
ever
we
could
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
---
"
Such
a
vista
of
wonder
opened
out
before
her
,
that
she
sat
looking
up
at
the
stars
,
quite
lost
,
until
Maggy
was
querulous
again
,
and
wanted
to
get
up
and
walk
.
   
<EOS>
Three
o'clock
,
and
half
-
past
three
,
and
<EOS>
they
had
passed
over
London
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
heard
the
rush
of
the
tide
against
obstacles
;
and
looked
down
,
awed
,
through
the
dark
vapour
on
the
river
;
had
seen
little
spots
of
lighted
water
where
the
bridge
lamps
were
reflected
,
shining
like
demon
eyes
,
with
a
terrible
fascination
in
them
for
guilt
and
misery
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
shrunk
past
homeless
people
,
lying
coiled
up
in
nooks
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
run
from
drunkards
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
started
from
slinking
men
,
whistling
and
signing
to
one
another
at
<EOS>
bye
corners
,
or
running
away
at
full
speed
.
 
<EOS>
Though
everywhere
the
leader
and
the
guide
,
Little
Dorrit
<EOS>
,
happy
for
once
in
her
youthful
appearance
,
feigned
to
cling
to
and
rely
upon
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
And
more
than
once
some
voice
,
from
among
a
knot
of
brawling
or
prowling
figures
in
their
path
,
had
called
out
to
the
rest
to
"
let
the
woman
and
the
child
go
by
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
the
woman
and
the
child
had
gone
by
,
and
gone
on
,
and
five
had
sounded
from
the
steeples
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
walking
slowly
towards
the
east
,
already
looking
for
the
first
pale
streak
of
day
,
when
a
woman
came
after
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
with
the
child
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
to
Maggy
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
young
---
far
too
young
to
be
there
,
Heaven
knows
!
<EOS>
---
and
neither
ugly
nor
wicked
-
looking
.
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
coarsely
,
but
with
no
naturally
coarse
voice
;
there
was
even
something
musical
in
its
sound
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
with
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Maggy
,
for
want
Of
a
better
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
see
,
without
my
telling
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
as
I
can
,
"
said
Maggy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Killing
myself
!
 
<EOS>
Now
I
have
answered
you
,
answer
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
doing
with
the
child
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
supposed
child
kept
her
head
drooped
down
,
and
kept
her
form
close
at
Maggy
's
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
thing
!
"
said
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
feeling
,
that
you
keep
her
out
in
the
cruel
streets
at
such
a
time
as
this
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
no
eyes
,
that
you
do
n't
see
how
delicate
and
slender
<EOS>
she
is
?
 
<EOS>
Have
<EOS>
you
no
sense
<EOS>
(
you
do
n't
look
as
if
you
had
much
)
that
you
do
n't
take
more
pity
on
this
cold
and
trembling
little
hand
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
stepped
across
to
that
side
,
and
held
the
hand
between
her
own
two
,
chafing
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Kiss
a
poor
lost
creature
,
dear
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
bending
her
face
,
"
and
tell
me
where
's
she
taking
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
turned
towards
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
my
God
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
recoiling
,
"
you
're
a
woman
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
that
!
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
clasping
one
of
her
hands
that
had
suddenly
released
hers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afraid
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
had
better
be
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
father
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
a
very
dear
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
home
to
him
,
and
be
afraid
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
thank
you
first
;
let
me
speak
to
you
as
if
I
really
were
a
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
do
it
,
"
said
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
kind
and
innocent
;
but
you
ca
n't
look
at
me
out
of
a
child
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
should
have
touched
you
,
but
I
thought
that
you
were
a
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
a
strange
,
wild
cry
,
she
went
away
.
   
<EOS>
No
day
yet
in
the
sky
,
but
there
was
day
in
the
resounding
stones
of
the
streets
;
in
the
waggons
,
carts
,
and
coaches
;
in
the
workers
going
to
various
occupations
;
in
the
opening
of
early
shops
;
in
the
traffic
at
markets
;
in
the
stir
of
the
riverside
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
coming
day
in
the
flaring
lights
,
with
a
feebler
colour
in
them
than
they
would
have
had
at
another
time
;
coming
day
in
the
increased
sharpness
of
the
air
,
and
the
ghastly
dying
of
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
They
went
back
again
to
the
gate
,
intending
to
wait
there
now
until
it
should
be
opened
;
but
the
air
was
so
raw
and
cold
that
Little
Dorrit
,
leading
Maggy
about
in
her
sleep
,
kept
in
motion
.
 
<EOS>
Going
round
by
the
Church
,
she
saw
lights
there
,
and
the
door
open
;
and
went
up
the
steps
and
looked
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
cried
a
stout
old
man
,
who
was
putting
on
a
nightcap
as
if
he
were
going
to
bed
in
a
vault
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
one
particular
,
sir
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
cried
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
's
have
a
look
at
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
caused
her
to
turn
back
again
in
the
act
of
going
out
,
and
to
present
herself
and
her
charge
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
!
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
YOU
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
often
seen
each
other
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
recognising
the
sexton
,
or
the
beadle
,
or
the
verger
,
or
whatever
he
was
,
"
when
I
have
been
at
church
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
More
than
that
,
we
've
got
your
birth
in
our
Register
,
you
know
;
you
're
one
of
our
curiosities
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
child
of
the
---
by
-
the
-
bye
<EOS>
,
how
did
you
get
out
<EOS>
so
early
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
were
shut
out
last
night
,
and
are
waiting
to
get
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
it
?
 
<EOS>
And
there
's
another
hour
good
yet
!
 
<EOS>
Come
into
the
vestry
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
find
a
fire
in
the
vestry
,
on
account
of
the
painters
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
waiting
for
the
painters
,
or
I
should
n't
be
here
<EOS>
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
our
curiosities
must
n't
be
cold
when
we
have
it
in
our
power
to
warm
her
up
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Come
along
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
good
old
fellow
,
in
his
familiar
way
;
and
having
stirred
the
vestry
fire
,
he
looked
round
the
shelves
of
registers
for
a
particular
volume
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
,
you
see
,
"
he
said
,
taking
it
down
and
turning
the
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
you
'll
find
yourself
,
as
large
as
life
.
 
<EOS>
Amy
,
daughter
of
William
and
Fanny
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Born
,
Marshalsea
Prison
,
Parish
of
St
George
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
tell
people
that
you
have
lived
there
,
without
so
much
as
a
day
's
or
a
night
's
absence
,
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
true
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
till
last
night
.
"
<EOS>
"
Lord
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
his
surveying
her
with
an
admiring
gaze
<EOS>
suggested
Something
else
to
him
,
to
wit
:
"
I
am
sorry
to
see
,
though
,
that
you
are
faint
and
tired
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
get
some
cushions
out
of
the
church
,
and
you
and
your
friend
shall
lie
down
before
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
not
going
in
to
join
your
father
when
the
gate
opens
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
call
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
soon
brought
in
the
cushions
,
and
strewed
them
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
,

I

daughters

And
though
they
were

they

been

I

Stop
a

<EOS>
I
must
put
something
under

your

<EOS>
Here
's
a
burial
volume
.
 
<EOS>
just
the
thing
!
 
<EOS>
We
have
got
Mrs
Bangham
in
this
book
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
makes
these
books
interesting
to
most
people
is
---
not
who
's
in
'em
,
but
who
is
n't
---
who
's
coming
,
you
know
,
and
when
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
interesting
question
.

Commendingly
looking
back
at
the
pillow
he
had
improvised
,
he
left
them
to
their
hour
's
repose
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
was
snoring
already
,
and
Little
Dorrit
was
soon
fast
asleep
with
her
head
resting
on
that
sealed
book
of
Fate
,
untroubled
by
its
mysterious
blank
leaves
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
Little
Dorrit
's
party
.
 
<EOS>
The
shame
,
desertion
,
wretchedness
,
and
exposure
of
the
great
capital
;
the
wet
,
the
cold
,
the
slow
hours
,
and
the
swift
clouds
of
the
dismal
night
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
party
from
which
Little
Dorrit
went
home
,
jaded
,
in
the
first
grey
mist
of
a
rainy
morning

Mrs
Flintwinch
has
another
Dream
 
<EOS>
The
debilitated
old
house
in
the
city
,
wrapped
in
its
mantle
of
soot
,
and
leaning
heavily
on
the
crutches
that
had
partaken
of
its
decay
and
worn
out
with
it
,
never
knew
a
healthy
or
a
cheerful
interval
,
let
what
would
betide
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
sun
ever
touched
it
,
it
was
but
with
a
ray
,
and
that
was
gone
in
half
an
hour
;
if
the
moonlight
ever
fell
upon
it
,
it
was
only
to
put
a
few
patches
on
its
doleful
cloak
,
and
make
it
look
more
wretched
.
 
<EOS>
The
stars
,
to
be
sure
,
coldly
watched
it
when
the
nights
and
the
smoke
were
clear
enough
;
and
all
bad
weather
stood
by
it
with
a
rare
fidelity
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
alike
find
rain
,
hail
,
frost
,
and
thaw
lingering
in
that
dismal
enclosure
when
they
had
vanished
from
other
places
;
and
as
to
snow
,
you
should
see
it
there
for
weeks
,
long
after
it
had
changed
from
yellow
to
black
,
slowly
weeping
away
its
grimy
life
.
<EOS>
The
place
had
no
other
adherents
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
street
noises
,
the
rumbling
of
wheels
in
the
lane
merely
rushed
in
at
the
gateway
in
going
past
,
and
rushed
out
again
:
making
the
listening
Mistress
Affery
feel
as
if
she
were
deaf
,
and
recovered
the
sense
of
hearing
by
instantaneous
flashes
.
 
<EOS>
So
with
whistling
,
singing
,
talking
,
laughing
,
and
all
pleasant
human
sounds
.
 
<EOS>
They
leaped
the
gap
in
a
moment
,
and
went
upon
their
way
.
<EOS>
The
varying
light
of
fire
and
candle
in
Mrs
Clennam
's
room
made
the
greatest
change
that
ever
broke
the
dead
monotony
of
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
two
long
narrow
windows
,
the
fire
shone
sullenly
all
day
,
and
sullenly
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
On
rare
occasions
it
flashed
up
passionately
,
as
she
did
;
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
suppressed
,
like
her
,
and
preyed
upon
itself
evenly
and
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
During
many
hours
of
the
short
winter
days
,
however
,
when
it
was
dusk
there
early
in
the
afternoon
,
changing
distortions
of
herself
in
her
wheeled
chair
,
of
Mr
Flintwinch
with
his
wry
neck
,
of
Mistress
Affery
coming
and
going
,
would
be
thrown
upon
the
house
wall
that
was
over
the
gateway
,
and
would
hover
there
like
shadows
from
a
great
magic
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
room
-
ridden
invalid
settled
for
the
night
,
these
would
gradually
disappear
:
Mistress
Affery
's
magnified
shadow
always
flitting
about
,
last
,
until
it
finally
glided
away
into
the
air
,
as
though
she
were
off
upon
a
witch
excursion
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
solitary
light
would
burn
unchangingly
,
until
it
burned
pale
before
the
dawn
,
and
at
last
died
under
the
breath
of
Mrs
Affery
,
as
her
shadow
descended
on
it
from
the
witch
-
region
of
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
Strange
,
if
the
little
sick
-
room
fire
were
in
effect
a
beacon
fire
,
summoning
some
one
,
and
that
the
most
unlikely
some
one
in
the
world
,
to
the
spot
that
MUST
be
come
to
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
,
if
the
little
sick
-
room
light
were
in
effect
a
watch
-
light
,
burning
in
that
place
every
night
until
an
appointed
event
should
be
watched
out
!
 
<EOS>
Which
of
the
vast
multitude
of
travellers
,
under
the
sun
and
the
stars
,
climbing
the
dusty
hills
and
toiling
along
the
weary
plains
,
journeying
by
land
and
journeying
by
sea
,
coming
and
going
so
strangely
,
to
meet
and
to
act
and
react
on
one
another
;
which
of
the
host
may
,
with
no
suspicion
of
the
journey
's
end
,
be
travelling
surely
hither
?
   
<EOS>
Time
shall
show
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
post
of
honour
and
the
post
of
shame
,
the
general
's
station
and
the
drummer
's
,
a
peer
's
statue
in
Westminster
Abbey
and
a
seaman
's
hammock
in
the
bosom
of
the
deep
,
the
mitre
and
the
workhouse
,
the
woolsack
and
the
gallows
,
the
throne
and
the
guillotine
---
the
travellers
to
all
are
on
the
great
high
road
,
but
it
has
wonderful
divergencies
,
and
only
Time
shall
show
us
whither
each
traveller
is
bound

<EOS>
On
a
wintry
afternoon
at
twilight
,
Mrs
Flintwinch
,
having
been
heavy
all
day
,
dreamed
this
dream
:
   
<EOS>
She
thought
she
was
in
the
kitchen
getting
the
kettle
ready
for
tea
,
and
was
warming
herself
with
her
feet
upon
the
fender
and
the
skirt
of
her
gown
tucked
up
,
before
the
collapsed
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
grate
,
bordered
on
either
hand
by
a
deep
cold
black
ravine
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
that
as
she
sat
thus
,
musing
upon
the
question
whether
life
was
not
for
some
people
a
rather
dull
invention
,
she
was
frightened
by
a
sudden
noise
behind
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
had
been
similarly
frightened
once
last
week
,
and
that
the
noise
was
of
a
mysterious
kind
---
a
sound
of
rustling
and
of
three
or
four
quick
beats
like
a
rapid
step
;
while
a
shock
or
tremble
was
communicated
to
her
heart
,
as
if
the
step
had
shaken
the
floor
,
or
even
as
if
she
had
been
touched
by
some
awful
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
that
this
revived
within
her
certain
old
fears
of
hers
that
the
house
was
haunted
;
and
that
she
flew
up
the
kitchen
stairs
without
knowing
how
she
got
up
,
to
be
nearer
company
.
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
thought
that
on
reaching
the
hall
,
she
saw
the
door
of
her
liege
lord
's
office
standing
open
,
and
the
room
empty
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
went
to
the
ripped
-
up
window
in
the
little
room
by
the
street
door
to
connect
her
palpitating
heart
,
through
the
glass
,
with
living
things
beyond
and
outside
the
haunted
house
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
then
saw
,
on
the
wall
over
the
gateway
,
the
shadows
of
the
two
clever
ones
in
conversation
above
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
then
went
up
-
stairs
with
her
shoes
in
her
hand
,
partly
to
be
near
the
clever
ones
as
a
match
for
most
ghosts
,
and
partly
to
hear
what
they
were
talking
about
.
   
<EOS>
"
None
of
your
nonsense
with
me
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
take
it
from
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Flintwinch
dreamed
that
she
stood
behind
the
door
,
which
was
just
ajar
,
and
most
distinctly
heard
her
husband
say
these
bold
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
Flintwinch
,
"
returned
Mrs
Clennam
,
in
her
usual
strong
low
voice
,
"
there
is
a
demon
of
anger
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
Guard
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
whether
there
's
one
or
a
dozen
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
forcibly
suggesting
in
his
tone
that
the
higher
number
was
nearer
the
mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
there
was
fifty
,
they
should
all
say
,
None
of
your
nonsense
with
me
,
I
wo
n't
take
it
from
you
<EOS>
---
I
'd
make
'em
say
it
,
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
,
you
wrathful
man
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
her
strong
voice
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Done
?
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dropped
down
upon
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
,
remonstrated
with
you
---
"
   
"
Do
n't
put
words
into
my
mouth
that
I
do
n't
mean
,
"
said
Jeremiah
,
sticking
to
his
figurative
expression
with
tenacious
and
impenetrable
obstinacy
:
"
I
mean
dropped
down
upon
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
remonstrated
with
you
,
"
she
began
again
,
"
because
---
"
   
"
I
wo
n't
have
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jeremiah
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
dropped
down
upon
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
dropped
down
upon
you
,
then
,
you
ill
-
conditioned
man
,
"
<EOS>
(
Jeremiah
chuckled
at
having
forced
her
to
adopt
his
phrase
,
)
"
for
having
been
needlessly
significant
to
Arthur
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
right
to
complain
of
it
as
almost
a
breach
of
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
not
mean
it
---
"
   
"
I
wo
n't
have
it
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
the
contradictory
Jeremiah
,
flinging
back
the
concession
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
must
leave
you
to
speak
in
soliloquy
if
you
choose
,
"
she
replied
,
after
a
pause
that
seemed
an
angry
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
my
addressing
myself
to
a
rash
and
headstrong
old
man
who
has
a
set
purpose
not
to
hear
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
wo
n't
take
that
from
you
either
,
"
said
Jeremiah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
I
did
mean
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
wish
to
know
why
I
meant
it
,
you
rash
and
headstrong
old
woman
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
you
only
restore
me
my
own
words
,
"
she
said
,
struggling
with
her
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
why
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Because
you
had
n't
cleared
his
father
to
him
,
and
you
ought
to
have
done
it
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
before
you
went
into
any
tantrum
about
yourself
,
who
are
---
"
   
"
Hold
there
,
Flintwinch
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
out
in
a
changed
voice
:
"
you
may
go
a
word
too
far
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
seemed
to
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
pause
,
and
he
had
altered
his
position
in
the
room
,
when
he
spoke
again
more
mildly
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
tell
you
why
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
before
you
took
your
own
part
,
I
thought
you
ought
to
have
taken
the
part
of
Arthur
's
father
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
's
father
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
particular
love
for
Arthur
's
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
served
Arthur
's
father
's
uncle
,
in
this
house
,
when
Arthur
's
father
was
not
much
above
me
---
was
poorer
as
far
as
his
pocket
went
---
and
when
his
uncle
might
as
soon
have
left
me
his
heir
as
have
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
starved
in
the
parlour
,
and
I
starved
in
the
kitchen
;
that
was
the
principal
difference
in
our
positions
;
there
was
not
much
more
than
a
flight
of
breakneck
stairs
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
took
to
him
in
those
times
;
I
do
n't
know
that
I
ever
took
to
him
greatly
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
undecided
,
irresolute
chap
,
who
had
everything
but
<EOS>
his
orphan
life
scared
out
of
him
when
he
was
young
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
brought
you
home
here
,
the
wife
his
uncle
had
named
for
him
,
I
did
n't
need
to
look
at
you
twice
<EOS>
(
you
were
a
good
-
looking
woman
at
that
time
)
to
know
who
'd
be
master
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
stood
of
your
own
strength
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
Stand
of
your
own
strength
now
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
lean
against
the
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
---
as
you
call
it
---
lean
against
the
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
had
a
mind
to
do
it
,
if
I
had
submitted
,
"
growled
Jeremiah
,
"
and
that
's
why
you
drop
down
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
forget
that
I
did
n't
submit
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
are
astonished
that
I
should
consider
it
worth
my
while
to
have
justice
done
to
Arthur
's
father
?
   
<EOS>
Hey
?
 
<EOS>
It
does
n't
matter
whether
you
answer
or
not
,
because
I
know
you
are
,
and
you
know
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
then
,
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
a
bit
of
an
oddity
in
point
of
temper
,
but
this
is
my
temper
<EOS>
---
I
ca
n't
let
anybody
have
entirely
their
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
determined
woman
,
and
a
clever
woman
;
and
when
you
see
your
purpose
before
you
,
nothing
will
turn
you
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Who
knows
that
better
than
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
will
turn
me
from
it
,
Flintwinch
,
when
I
have
justified
it
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Add
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Justified
it
to
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
I
said
you
were
the
most
determined
woman
on
the
face
of
the
earth
<EOS>
(
or
I
meant
to
say
so
)
,
and
if
you
are
determined
to
justify
any
object
you
entertain
,
of
course
you
'll
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Man
!
 
<EOS>
I
justify
myself
by
the
authority
of
these
Books
,
"
she
cried
,
with
stern
emphasis
,
and
appearing
from
the
sound
that
followed
to
strike
the
dead
-
weight
of
her
arm
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
that
,
"
returned
Jeremiah
calmly
,
"
we
wo
n't
enter
into
that
question
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
However
that
may
be
,
you
carry
out
your
purposes
,
and
you
make
everything
go
down
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
wo
n't
go
down
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
faithful
to
you
,
and
useful
to
you
,
and
I
am
attached
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
consent
,
and
I
wo
n't
consent
,
and
I
never
did
consent
,
and
I
never
will
consent
to
be
lost
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
Swallow
up
everybody
else
,
and
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
The
peculiarity
of
my
temper
is
,
ma'am
,
that
I
wo
n't
be
swallowed
up
alive
.
"
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
had
Originally
been
the
mainspring
of
the
understanding
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Descrying
thus
much
of
force
of
character
in
Mr
Flintwinch
,
perhaps
Mrs
Clennam
had
deemed
alliance
with
him
worth
her
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
Enough
and
more
than
enough
of
the
subject
,
"
said
she
gloomily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
drop
down
upon
me
again
,
"
returned
the
persistent
Flintwinch
,
"
and
then
you
must
expect
to
hear
of
it
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
dreamed
that
the
figure
of
her
lord
here
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
,
as
if
to
cool
his
spleen
,
and
that
she
ran
away
;
but
that
,
as
he
did
not
issue
forth
when
she
had
stood
listening
and
trembling
in
the
shadowy
hall
a
little
time
,
she
crept
up
-
stairs
again
,
impelled
as
before
by
ghosts
and
curiosity
,
and
once
more
cowered
outside
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Please
to
light
the
candle
,
Flintwinch
,
"
Mrs
Clennam
was
saying
,
apparently
wishing
to
draw
him
back
into
their
usual
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
nearly
time
for
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
is
coming
,
and
will
find
me
in
the
dark
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
lighted
the
candle
briskly
,
and
said
as
he
put
it
down
upon
the
table
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
Little
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
Is
she
to
come
to
work
here
for
ever
?
 
<EOS>
To
come
to
tea
here
for
ever
?
 
<EOS>
To
come
backwards
and
forwards
here
,
in
the
same
way
,
for
ever
?
"
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
talk
about
"
for
ever
"
to
a
maimed
creature
like
me
?
<EOS>
Are
we
not
all
cut
down
like
the
grass
of
the
field
,
and
was
not
I
shorn
by
the
scythe
many
years
ago
:
since
when
I
have
been
lying
here
,
waiting
to
be
gathered
into
the
barn
?
"
   
"
Ay
,
ay
!
 
<EOS>
But
since
you
have
been
lying
here
---
not
near
dead
---
nothing
like
it
---
numbers
of
children
and
young
people
,
blooming
women
,
strong
men
,
and
what
not
,
have
been
cut
down
and
carried
;
and
still
here
are
you
,
you
see
,
not
much
changed
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
Your
time
and
mine
may
be
a
long
one
yet
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
say
for
ever
,
I
mean
(
though
I
am
not
poetical
)
through
all
our
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
gave
this
explanation
with
great
calmness
,
and
calmly
waited
for
an
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
long
as
Little
Dorrit
is
quiet
and
industrious
,
and
stands
in
need
of
the
slight
help
I
can
give
her
,
and
deserves
it
;
so
long
,
I
suppose
,
unless
she
withdraws
of
her
own
act
,
she
will
continue
to
come
here
,
I
being
spared
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
than
that
?
"
said
Flintwinch
,
stroking
his
mouth
and
chin
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
should
there
be
more
than
that
!
 
<EOS>
What
could
there
be
more
than
that
!
"
<EOS>
she
ejaculated
in
her
sternly
wondering
way
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Flintwinch
dreamed
,
that
,
for
the
space
of
a
minute
or
two
,
they
remained
looking
at
each
other
with
the
candle
between
them
,
and
that
she
somehow
derived
an
impression
that
they
looked
at
each
other
fixedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
happen
to
know
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Clennam
,
"
Affery
's
liege
lord
then
demanded
in
a
much
lower
voice
,
and
with
an
amount
of
expression
that
seemed
quite
out
of
proportion
to
the
simple
purpose
of
his
words
,
"
where
she
lives
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
---
now
,
would
you
like
to
know
?
"
said
Jeremiah
with
a
pounce
as
if
he
had
sprung
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
cared
to
know
,
I
should
know
already
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
not
have
asked
her
any
day
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
do
n't
care
to
know
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
having
expelled
a
long
significant
breath
said
,
with
his
former
emphasis
,
"
For
I
have
accidentally
---
mind
!
---
found
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wherever
she
lives
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
speaking
in
one
unmodulated
hard
voice
,
and
separating
her
words
as
distinctly
as
if
she
were
reading
them
off
from
separate
bits
of
metal
that
she
took
up
one
by
one
,
"
she
has
made
a
secret
of
it
,
and
she
shall
always
keep
her
secret
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
perhaps
you
would
rather
not
have
known
the
fact
,
any
how
?
"
said
Jeremiah
;
and
he
said
it
with
a
twist
,
as
if
his
words
had
come
out
of
him
in
his
own
wry
shape
.
   
<EOS>
"
Flintwinch
,
"
said
his
mistress
and
partner
,
flashing
into
a
sudden
energy
that
made
Affery
start
,
"
why
do
you
goad
me
?
 
<EOS>
Look
round
this
room
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
is
any
compensation
for
my
long
confinement
within
these
narrow
limits
---
not
that
I
complain
of
being
afflicted
;
you
know
I
never
complain
of
that
---
if
it
is
any
compensation
to
me
for
long
confinement
to
this
room
,
that
while
I
am
shut
up
from
all
pleasant
change
I
am
also
shut
up
from
the
knowledge
of
some
things
that
I
may
prefer
to
avoid
knowing
,
why
should
you
,
of
all
men
,
grudge
me
that
belief
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
grudge
it
to
you
,
"
returned
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Let
Little
Dorrit
keep
her
secret
from
me
,
and
do
you
keep
it
from
me
also
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
come
and
go
,
unobserved
and
unquestioned
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
suffer
,
and
let
me
have
what
alleviation
belongs
to
my
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
so
much
,
that
you
torment
me
like
an
evil
spirit
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
asked
you
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
answered
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Say
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
sound
of
the
wheeled
chair
was
heard
upon
the
floor
,
and
Affery
's
bell
rang
with
a
hasty
jerk
.
   
<EOS>
More
afraid
of
her
husband
at
the
moment
than
of
the
mysterious
sound
in
the
kitchen
,
Affery
crept
away
as
lightly
and
as
quickly
as
she
could
,
descended
the
kitchen
stairs
almost
as
rapidly
as
she
had
ascended
them
,
resumed
her
seat
before
the
fire
,
tucked
up
her
skirt
again
,
and
finally
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
bell
rang
once
more
,
and
then
once
more
,
and
then
kept
on
ringing
;
in
despite
of
which
importunate
summons
,
Affery
still
sat
behind
her
apron
,
recovering
her
breath
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
Mr
Flintwinch
came
shuffling
down
the
staircase
into
the
hall
,
muttering
and
calling
"
Affery
woman
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Affery
still
remaining
behind
her
apron
,
he
came
stumbling
down
the
kitchen
stairs
,
candle
in
hand
,
sidled
up
to
her
,
twitched
her
apron
off
,
and
roused
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
Jeremiah
!
"
cried
Affery
,
waking
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
start
you
gave
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
been
doing
,
woman
?
"
inquired
Jeremiah
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
rung
for
fifty
times
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
Jeremiah
,
"
said
Mistress
Affery
,
"
I
have
been
a
-
dreaming
!
"
   
<EOS>
Reminded
of
her
former
achievement
in
that
way
<EOS>
,
Mr
Flintwinch
held
the
candle
to
her
head
,
as
if
he
had
some
idea
of
lighting
her
up
for
the
illumination
of
the
kitchen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
it
's
her
tea
-
time
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
with
a
vicious
grin
,
and
giving
one
of
the
legs
of
Mistress
Affery
's
chair
a
kick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jeremiah
?
 
<EOS>
Tea
-
time
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
's
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
got
such
a
dreadful
turn
,
Jeremiah
,
before
I
went
---
off
a
-
dreaming
,
that
I
think
it
must
be
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yoogh
!
 
<EOS>
Sleepy
-
Head
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
"
what
are
you
talking
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
a
strange
noise
,
Jeremiah
,
and
such
a
curious
movement
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
kitchen
here
---
just
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jeremiah
held
up
his
light
and
looked
at
the
blackened
ceiling
,
held
down
his
light
and
looked
at
the
damp
stone
floor
,
turned
round
with
his
light
and
looked
about
at
the
spotted
and
blotched
walls
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rats
,
cats
,
water
,
drains
,
"
said
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
negatived
each
with
a
shake
of
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Jeremiah
;
I
have
felt
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
felt
it
up
-
stairs
,
and
once
on
the
staircase
as
I
was
going
from
her
room
to
ours
in
the
night
---
a
rustle
and
a
sort
of
trembling
touch
behind
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Affery
,
my
woman
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
grimly
,
after
advancing
his
nose
to
that
lady
's
lips
as
a
test
for
the
detection
of
spirituous
liquors
,
"
if
you
do
n't
get
tea
pretty
quick
,
old
woman
,
you
'll
become
sensible
of
a
rustle
and
a
touch
that
'll
send
you
flying
to
the
other
end
of
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
prediction
stimulated
Mrs
Flintwinch
to
bestir
herself
,
and
to
hasten
up
-
stairs
to
Mrs
Clennam
's
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
that
,
she
now
began
to
entertain
a
settled
conviction
that
there
was
something
wrong
in
the
gloomy
house
.
 
<EOS>
Henceforth
,
she
was
never
at
peace
in
it
after
daylight
departed
;
and
never
went
up
or
down
stairs
in
the
dark
without
having
her
apron
over
her
head
,
lest
she
should
see
something
.
   
<EOS>
What
with
these
ghostly
apprehensions
and
her
singular
dreams
,
Mrs
Flintwinch
fell
that
evening
into
a
haunted
state
of
mind
,
from
which
it
may
be
long
before
this
present
narrative
descries
any
trace
of
her
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
vagueness
and
indistinctness
of
all
her
new
experiences
and
perceptions
,
as
everything
about
her
was
mysterious
to
herself
<EOS>
she
began
to
be
mysterious
to
others
:
and
became
as
difficult
to
be
made
out
to
anybody
's
satisfaction
as
she
found
the
house
and
everything
in
it
difficult
to
make
out
to
her
own
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
not
yet
finished
preparing
Mrs
Clennam
's
tea
,
when
the
soft
knock
came
to
the
door
which
always
announced
Little
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
looked
on
at
Little
Dorrit
taking
off
her
homely
bonnet
in
the
hall
,
and
at
Mr
Flintwinch
scraping
his
jaws
and
contemplating
her
in
silence
,
as
expecting
some
wonderful
consequence
to
ensue
which
would
frighten
her
out
of
her
five
wits
or
blow
them
all
three
to
pieces
.
   
<EOS>
After
tea
there
came
another
knock
at
the
door
,
announcing
Arthur
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
went
down
to
let
him
in
,
and
he
said
on
entering
,
"
Affery
,
I
am
glad
it
's
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
.
<EOS>
"
Affery
immediately
replied
,
"
For
goodness
sake
do
n't
ask
me
nothing
,
Arthur
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
frightened
out
of
one
half
of
my
life
,
and
dreamed
out
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
nothing
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
which
is
which
,
or
what
is
what
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
immediately
started
away
from
him
,
and
came
near
him
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
having
no
taste
for
reading
,
and
no
sufficient
light
for
needlework
in
the
subdued
room
,
supposing
her
to
have
the
inclination
,
now
sat
every
night
in
the
dimness
from
which
she
had
momentarily
emerged
on
the
evening
of
Arthur
Clennam
's
return
,
occupied
with
crowds
of
wild
speculations
and
suspicions
respecting
her
mistress
and
her
husband
and
the
noises
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
ferocious
devotional
exercises
were
engaged
in
,
these
speculations
would
distract
Mistress
Affery
's
eyes
towards
the
door
,
as
if
she
expected
some
dark
form
to
appear
at
those
propitious
moments
,
and
make
the
party
one
too
many
.
   
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
Affery
never
said
or
did
anything
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
two
clever
ones
towards
her
in
any
marked
degree
,
except
on
certain
occasions
,
generally
at
about
the
quiet
hour
towards
bed
-
time
,
when
she
would
suddenly
dart
out
of
her
dim
corner
,
and
whisper
with
a
face
of
terror
to
Mr
Flintwinch
,
reading
the
paper
near
Mrs
Clennam
's
little
table
:
"
<EOS>
There
,

What

Then
the
noise
,
if
there
were
any
,
would
have
ceased

and
Mr
Flintwinch
would
snarl
,
turning
upon
her
as

she
had
cut
him
down
that
moment
against
his

Affery

Nobody
's
Weakness
 
<EOS>
The
time
being
come
for
the
renewal
of
his
acquaintance
with
the
Meagles
family
,
Clennam
,
pursuant
to
contract
made
between
himself
and
Mr
Meagles
within
the
precincts
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
turned
his
face
on
a
certain
Saturday
towards
Twickenham
,
where
Mr
Meagles
had
a
cottage
-
residence
of
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
The
weather
being
fine
and
dry
,
and
any
English
road
abounding
in
interest
for
him
who
had
been
so
long
away
,
he
sent
his
valise
on
by
the
coach
,
and
set
out
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
A
walk
was
in
itself
a
new
enjoyment
to
him
,
and
one
that
had
rarely
diversified
his
life
afar
off
.
   
<EOS>
He
went
by
Fulham
and
Putney
,
for
the
pleasure
of
strolling
over
the
heath
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
bright
and
shining
there
;
and
when
he
found
himself
so
far
on
his
road
to
Twickenham
,
he
found
himself
a
long
way
on
his
road
to
a
number
of
airier
and
less
substantial
destinations
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
risen
before
him
fast
,
in
the
healthful
exercise
and
the
pleasant
road
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
easy
to
walk
alone
in
the
country
without
musing
upon
something
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
had
plenty
of
unsettled
subjects
to
meditate
upon
,
though
he
had
been
walking
to
the
Land
's
End
.
   
<EOS>
First
,
there
was
the
subject
seldom
absent
from
his
mind
,
the
question
,
what
he
was
to
do
henceforth
in
life
;
to
what
occupation
he
should
devote
himself
,
and
in
what
direction
he
had
best
seek
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
far
from
rich
,
and
every
day
of
indecision
and
inaction
made
his
inheritance
a
source
of
greater
anxiety
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
often
as
he
began
to
consider
how
to
increase
this
inheritance
,
or
to
lay
it
by
,
so
often
his
misgiving
that
there
was
some
one
with
an
unsatisfied
claim
upon
his
justice
,
returned
;
and
that
alone
was
a
subject
to
outlast
the
longest
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
there
was
the
subject
of
his
relations
with
his
mother
,
which
were
now
upon
an
equable
and
peaceful
but
never
confidential
footing
,
and
whom
he
saw
several
times
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
a
leading
and
a
constant
subject
:
for
the
circumstances
of
his
life
,
united
to
those
of
her
own
story
,
presented
the
little
creature
to
him
as
the
only
person
between
whom
and
himself
there
were
ties
of
innocent
reliance
on
one
hand
,
and
affectionate
protection
on
the
other
;
ties
of
compassion
,
respect
,
unselfish
interest
,
gratitude
,
and
pity
.
<EOS>
Thinking
of
her
,
and
of
the
possibility
of
her
father
's
release
from
prison
by
the
unbarring
hand
of
death
---
the
only
change
of
circumstance
he
could
foresee
that
might
enable
him
to
be
such
a
friend
to
her
as
he
wished
to
be
,
by
altering
her
whole
manner
of
life
,
smoothing
her
rough
road
,
and
giving
her
a
home
---
he
regarded
her
,
in
that
perspective
,
as
his
adopted
daughter
,
his
poor
child
of
the
Marshalsea
hushed
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
were
a
last
subject
in
his
thoughts
,
and
it
lay
towards
Twickenham
,
its
form
was
so
indefinite
that
it
was
little
more
than
the
pervading
atmosphere
in
which
these
other
subjects
floated
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
crossed
the
heath
and
was
leaving
it
behind
when
he
gained
upon
a
figure
which
had
been
in
advance
of
him
for
some
time
,
and
which
,
as
he
gained
upon
it
,
he
thought
he
knew
.
 
<EOS>
He
derived
this
impression
from
something
in
the
turn
of
the
head
,
and
in
the
figure
's
action
of
consideration
,
as
it
went
on
at
a
sufficiently
sturdy
walk
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
man
---
for
it
was
a
man
's
figure
---
pushed
his
hat
up
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
stopped
to
consider
some
object
before
him
,
he
knew
it
to
be
Daniel
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Doyce
?
"
said
Clennam
,
overtaking
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
again
,
and
in
a
healthier
place
than
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
's
friend
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
that
public
criminal
,
coming
out
of
some
mental
combinations
he
had
been
making
,
and
offering
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
excuse
me
if
I
forget
your
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Readily
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
a
celebrated
name
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
Barnacle
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Daniel
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
I
know
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Clennam
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
hope
,
"
said
Arthur
,
as
they
walked
on
together
,
"
that
we
may
be
going
to
the
same
place
,
Mr
Doyce
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Meaning
Twickenham
?
"
returned
Daniel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
soon
quite
intimate
,
and
lightened
the
way
with
a
variety
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
The
ingenious
culprit
was
a
man
of
great
modesty
and
good
sense
;
and
,
though
a
plain
man
,
had
been
too
much
accustomed
to
combine
what
was
original
and
daring
in
conception
with
what
was
patient
and
minute
in
execution
,
to
be
by
any
means
an
ordinary
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
first
difficult
to
lead
him
to
speak
about
himself
,
and
he
put
off
Arthur
's
advances
in
that
direction
by
admitting
slightly
,
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
he
had
done
this
,
and
he
had
done
that
,
and
such
a
thing
was
of
his
making
,
and
such
another
thing
was
his
discovery
,
but
it
was
his
trade
,
you
see
,
his
trade
;
until
,
as
he
gradually
became
assured
that
his
companion
had
a
real
interest
in
his
account
of
himself
,
he
frankly
yielded
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
appeared
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
north
-
country
blacksmith
,
and
had
originally
been
apprenticed
by
his
widowed
mother
to
a
lock
-
maker
;
that
he
had
"
struck
out
a
few
little
things
"
at
the
lock
-
maker
's
,
which
had
led
to
his
being
released
from
his
indentures
with
a
present
,
which
present
had
enabled
him
to
gratify
his
ardent
wish
to
bind
himself
to
a
working
engineer
,
under
whom
he
had
laboured
hard
,
learned
hard
,
and
lived
hard
,
seven
years
.
 
<EOS>
His
time
being
out
,
he
had
"
worked
in
the
shop
"
at
weekly
wages
seven
or
eight
years
more
;
and
had
then
betaken
himself
to
the
banks
of
the
Clyde
,
where
he
had
studied
,
and
filed
,
and
hammered
,
and
improved
his
knowledge
,
theoretical
and
practical
,
for
six
or
seven
years
more
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
had
had
an
offer
to
go
to
Lyons
,
which
he
had
accepted
;
and
from
Lyons
had
been
engaged
to
go
to
Germany
,
and
in
Germany
had
had
an
offer
to
go
to
St
Petersburg
,
and
there
had
done
very
well
indeed
---
never
better
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
had
naturally
felt
a
preference
for
his
own
country
,
and
a
wish
to
gain
distinction
there
,
and
to
do
whatever
service
he
could
do
,
there
rather
than
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
had
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
at
home
he
had
established
himself
in
business
,
and
had
invented
and
executed
,
and
worked
his
way
on
,
until
,
after
a
dozen
years
of
constant
suit
and
service
,
he
had
been
enrolled
in
the
Great
British
Legion
of
Honour
,
the
Legion
of
the
Rebuffed
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
and
had
been
decorated
with
the
Great
British
Order
of
Merit
,
the
Order
of
the
Disorder
of
the
Barnacles
and
Stiltstalkings
.
   
<EOS>
"
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
that
you
ever
turned
your
thoughts
that
way
,
Mr
Doyce
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
sir
,
true
to
a
certain
extent
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
is
a
man
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
if
he
has
the
misfortune
to
strike
out
something
serviceable
to
the
nation
,
he
must
follow
where
it
leads
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
he
better
let
it
go
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
do
it
,
"
said
Doyce
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
thoughtful
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
put
into
his
head
to
be
buried
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
put
into
his
head
to
be
made
useful
.
 
<EOS>
You
hold
your
life
on
the
condition
that
to
the
last
you
shall
struggle
hard
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
holds
a
discovery
on
the
same
terms
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
to
say
,
"
said
Arthur
,
with
a
growing
admiration
of
his
quiet
companion
,
"
you
are
not
finally
discouraged
even
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
be
,
if
I
am
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
thing
is
as
true
as
it
ever
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
they
had
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
,
Clennam
,
at
once
to
change
the
direct
point
of
their
conversation
and
not
to
change
it
too
abruptly
,
asked
Mr
Doyce
if
he
had
any
partner
in
his
business
to
relieve
him
of
a
portion
of
its
anxieties
?
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
returned
,
"
not
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
when
I
first
entered
on
it
,
and
a
good
man
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
has
been
dead
some
years
;
and
<EOS>
as
I
could
not
easily
take
to
the
notion
of
another
when
I
lost
him
,
I
bought
his
share
for
myself
and
have
gone
on
by
myself
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
's
another
thing
,
"
he
said
,
stopping
for
a
moment
with
a
good
-
humoured
laugh
in
his
eyes
,
and
laying
his
closed
right
hand
,
with
its
peculiar
suppleness
of
thumb
,
on
Clennam
's
arm
,
"
no
inventor
can
be
a
man
of
business
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
so
the
men
of
business
say
,
"
he
answered
,
resuming
the
walk
and
laughing
outright
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
we
unfortunate
creatures
should
be
supposed
to
want
common
sense
,
but
it
is
generally
taken
for
granted
that
we
do
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
best
friend
I
have
in
the
world
,
our
excellent
friend
over
yonder
,
"
said
Doyce
,
nodding
towards
Twickenham
,
"
extends
a
sort
of
protection
to
me
,
do
n't
you
know
,
as
a
man
not
quite
able
to
take
care
of
himself
?
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
could
not
help
joining
in
the
good
-
humoured
laugh
,
for
he
recognised
the
truth
of
the
description
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
find
that
I
must
have
a
partner
who
is
a
man
of
business
and
not
guilty
of
any
inventions
,
"
said
Daniel
Doyce
,
taking
off
his
hat
to
pass
his
hand
over
his
forehead
,
"
if
it
's
only
in
deference
to
the
current
opinion
,
and
to
uphold
the
credit
of
the
Works
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
'll
find
that
I
have
been
very
remiss
or
confused
in
my
way
of
conducting
them
;
but
that
's
for
him
to
say
---
whoever
he
is
---
not
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
chosen
him
yet
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
just
come
to
a
decision
to
take
one
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
there
's
more
to
do
than
there
used
to
be
,
and
the
Works
are
enough
for
me
as
I
grow
older
.
 
<EOS>
What
with
the
books
and
correspondence
,
and
foreign
journeys
for
which
a
Principal
is
necessary
,
I
ca
n't
do
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
talk
over
the
best
way
of
negotiating
the
matter
,
if
I
find
a
spare
half
-
hour
between
this
and
Monday
morning
,
with
my
---
my
Nurse
and
protector
,
"
said
Doyce
,
with
laughing
eyes
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
sagacious
man
in
business
,
and
has
had
a
good
apprenticeship
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
this
,
they
conversed
on
different
subjects
until
they
arrived
at
their
journey
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
A
composed
and
unobtrusive
self
-
sustainment
was
noticeable
in
Daniel
Doyce
---
a
calm
knowledge
that
what
was
true
must
remain
true
,
in
spite
of
all
the
Barnacles
in
the
family
ocean
,
and
would
be
just
the
truth
,
and
neither
more
nor
less
when
even
that
sea
had
run
dry
---
which
had
a
kind
of
greatness
in
it
,
though
not
of
the
official
quality
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
knew
the
house
well
,
he
conducted
Arthur
to
it
by
the
way
that
showed
it
to
the
best
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
charming
place
(
none
the
worse
for
being
a
little
eccentric
)
,
on
the
road
by
the
river
,
and
just
what
the
residence
of
the
Meagles
family
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
stood
in
a
garden
,
no
doubt
as
fresh
and
beautiful
in
the
May
of
the
Year
as
Pet
now
was
in
the
May
of
her
life
;
and
it
was
defended
by
a
goodly
show
of
handsome
trees
and
spreading
evergreens
,
as
Pet
was
by
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
made
out
of
an
old
brick
house
,
of
which
a
part
had
been
altogether
pulled
down
,
and
another
part
had
been
changed
into
the
present
cottage
;
so
there
was
a
hale
elderly
portion
,
to
represent
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
,
and
a
young
picturesque
,
very
pretty
portion
to
represent
Pet

<EOS>
There
was
even
the
later
addition
of
a
conservatory
sheltering
itself
against
it
,
uncertain
of
hue
in
its
deep
-
stained
glass
,
and
in
its
more
transparent
portions
flashing
to
the
sun
's
rays
,
now
like
fire
and
now
like
harmless
water
drops
;
which
might
have
stood
for
Tattycoram
.
 
<EOS>
Within
view
was
the
peaceful
river
and
the
ferry
-
boat
,
to
moralise
to
all
the
inmates
saying
:
Young
or
old
,
passionate
or
tranquil
,
chafing
or
content
,
<EOS>
you
,
thus
runs
the
current
always
.
 
<EOS>
Let
the
heart
swell
into
what
discord
it
will
,
thus
plays
the
rippling
water
on
the
prow
of
the
ferry
-
boat
ever
the
same
tune
.
 
<EOS>
Year
after
year
,
so
much
allowance
for
the
drifting
of
the
boat
,
so
many
miles
an
hour
the
flowing
of
the
stream
,
here
the
rushes
,
there
the
lilies
,
nothing
uncertain
or
unquiet
,
upon
this
road
that
steadily
runs
away
;
while
you
,
upon
your
flowing
road
of
time
,
are
so
capricious
and
distracted
.
   
<EOS>
The
bell
at
the
gate
had
scarcely
sounded
when
Mr
Meagles
came
out
to
receive
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
had
scarcely
come

Mrs

Never

visitors
a

<EOS>
"
Here
we
are
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
boxed
up
,
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
within
our
own
home
-
limits
,
as
if
we
were
never
going
to
expand
---
that
is
,
travel
---
again
.
 
<EOS>
Not
like
Marseilles
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
No
allonging
and
marshonging
here
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
different
kind
of
beauty
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
said
Clennam
,
looking
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Meagles
,
rubbing
his
hands
with
a
relish
,
"
it
was
an
uncommonly
pleasant
thing
being
in
quarantine
,
was
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
I
have
often
wished
myself
back
again
?
 
<EOS>
We
were
a
capital
party
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
Mr
Meagles
's
invariable
habit
.
 
<EOS>
Always
to
object
to
everything
while
he
was
travelling
,
and
always
to
want
to
get
back
to
it
when
he
was
not
travelling
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
summer
-
time
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
which
I
wish
it
was
on
your
account
,
and
in
order
that
you
might
see
the
place
at
its
best
,
you
would
hardly
be
able
to
hear
yourself
speak
for
birds
.
<EOS>
Being
practical
people
,
we
never
allow
anybody
to
scare
the
birds
;
and
the
birds
,
being
practical
people
too
,
come
about
us
in
myriads
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
delighted
to
see
you
,
Clennam
<EOS>
(
if
you
'll
allow
me
,
I
shall
drop
the

;
I
heartily
assure
you
,
we
are
delighted
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
had
so
pleasant
a
greeting
,
"
said
Clennam
---
then
he
recalled
what
Little
Dorrit
had
said
to
him
in
his
own
room
,
and
faithfully
added
"
except
once
---
since
we
last
walked
to
and
fro
,
looking
down
at
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Something
like
a
look
out
,
that
was
,
was
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
a
military
government
,
but
I
should
n't
mind
a
little
allonging
and
marshonging
---
<EOS>
just
a
dash
of
it
---
in
this
neighbourhood
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
Devilish
still
.
"
   
<EOS>
Bestowing
this
eulogium
on
the
retired
character
of
his
retreat
with
a
dubious
shake
of
the
head
,
Mr
Meagles
led
the
way
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
just
large
enough
,
and
no
more
;
was
as
pretty
within
as
it
was
without
,
and
was
perfectly
well
-
arranged
and
comfortable
.
   
<EOS>
Some
traces
of
the
migratory
habits
of
the
family
were
to
be
observed
in
the
covered
frames
and
furniture
,
and
wrapped
-
up
hangings
;
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
it
was
one
of
Mr
Meagles
's
whims
to
have
the
cottage
always
kept
,
in
their
absence
,
as
if
they
were
always
coming
back
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Of
articles
collected
on
his
various
expeditions
,
there
was
such
a
vast
miscellany
that
it
was
like
the
dwelling
of
an
amiable
Corsair
.
<EOS>
There
were
antiquities
from
Central
Italy
,
made
by
the
best
modern
houses
in
that
department
of
industry
;
<EOS>
bits
of
mummy
from
Egypt
(
and
perhaps
Birmingham
)
;
model
gondolas
from
Venice
;
model
villages
from
Switzerland
;
morsels
of
tesselated
pavement
from
Herculaneum
and
Pompeii
,
like
petrified
minced
veal
;
ashes
out
of
tombs
,
and
lava
out
of
Vesuvius
;
Spanish
fans
,
Spezzian
straw
hats
,
Moorish
slippers
,
Tuscan
hairpins
,
Carrara
sculpture
,
Trastaverini
scarves
,
Genoese
velvets
and
filigree
,
Neapolitan
coral
,
Roman
cameos
,
Geneva
jewellery
,
Arab
lanterns
,
<EOS>
rosaries
blest
all
round
by
the
Pope
himself
,
and
an
infinite
variety
of
lumber
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
views
,
like
and
unlike
,
of
a
multitude
of
places
;
and
there
was
one
little
picture
-
room
devoted
to
a
few
of
the
regular
sticky
old
Saints
,
with
sinews
like
whipcord
,
hair
like
Neptune
's
,
wrinkles
like
tattooing
,
and
such
coats
of
varnish
that
every
holy
personage
served
for
a
fly
-
trap
,
and
became
what
is
now
called
in
the
vulgar
tongue
a
Catch
-
em
-
alive
O.
 
Of
these
pictorial
acquisitions
Mr
Meagles
spoke
in
the
usual
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
no
judge
,
he
said
,
except
of
what
pleased
himself
;
he
had
picked
them
up
,
dirt
-
cheap
,
and
people
had
considered
them
rather
fine
.
 
<EOS>
One
man
,
who
at
any
rate
ought
to
know
something
of
the
subject
,
had
declared
that
"
Sage
,
Reading
"
(
a
specially
oily
old
gentleman
in
a
blanket
,
with
a
swan's
-
down
tippet
for
a
beard
,
and
a
web
of
cracks
all
over
him
like
rich
pie
-
crust
)
,
to
be
a
fine
Guercino
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
Sebastian
del
Piombo
there
,
you
would
judge
for
yourself
;
if
it
were
not
his
later
manner
,
the
question
was
,
Who
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
Titian
,
that
might
or
might
not
be
---
perhaps
he
had
only
touched
it
.
 
<EOS>
Daniel
Doyce
said
perhaps
he
had
n't
touched
it
,
but
Mr
Meagles
rather
declined
to
overhear
the
remark
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
shown
all
his
spoils
,
Mr
Meagles
took
them
into
his
own
snug
room
overlooking
the
lawn
,
which
was
fitted
up
in
part
like
a
dressing
-
room
and
in
part
like
an
office
,
and
in
which
,
upon
a
kind
of
counter
-
desk
,
were
a
pair
of
brass
scales
for
weighing
gold
,
and
a
scoop
for
shovelling
out
money
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
they
are
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
stood
behind
these
two
articles
five
-
and
-
thirty
years
running
,
when
I
no
more
thought
of
gadding
about
than
I
now
think
of
---
staying
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
left
the
Bank
for
good
,
I
asked
for
them
,
and
brought
them
away
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
mention
it
at
once
,
or
you
might
suppose
that
I
sit
in
my
counting
-
house
(
as
Pet
says
I
do
)
,
like
the
king
in
the
poem
of
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
blackbirds
,
counting
out
my
money
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
's
eyes
had
strayed
to
a
natural
picture
on
the
wall
,
of
two
pretty
little
girls
with
their
arms
entwined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Clennam
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
in
a
lower
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
they
both
are
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
taken
some
seventeen
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
often
say
to
Mother
,
they
were
babies
then
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Their
names
?
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
never
heard
any
name
<EOS>
but
<EOS>
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
Pet
's
name
is
Minnie
;
her
sister
's
Lillie
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Should
you
have
known
,
Mr
Clennam
,
that
one
of
them
was
meant
for
me
?
"
asked
Pet
herself
,
now
standing
in
the
doorway
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
might
have
thought
that
both
of
them
were
meant
for
you
,
both
are
still
so
like
you
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
"
said
Clennam
,
glancing
from
the
fair
original
to
the
picture
and
back
,
"
I
can
not
even
now
say
which
is
not
your
portrait
.
"
<EOS>
"
D'ye
hear
that
,
Mother
?
"
cried
Mr
Meagles
to
his
wife
,
who
had
followed
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
always
the
same
,
Clennam
;
nobody
can
decide
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
to
your
left
is
Pet
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
picture
happened
to
be
near
a
looking
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
As
Arthur
looked
at
it
again
,
he
saw
,
by
the
reflection
of
the
mirror
<EOS>
,
Tattycoram
stop
in
passing
outside
the
door
,
listen
to
what
was
going
on
,
and
pass
away
with
an
angry
and
contemptuous
frown
upon
her
face
,
that
changed
its
beauty
into
ugliness
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
come
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
a
long
walk
,
and
will
be
glad
to
get
your
boots
off
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Daniel
here
,
I
suppose
he
'd
never
think
of
taking
his
boots
off
,
unless
we
showed
him
a
boot
-
jack
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
asked
Daniel
,
with
a
significant
smile
at
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
so
many
things
to
think
about
,
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
,
as
if
his
weakness
must
not
be
left
to
itself
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
"
Figures
,
and
wheels
,
and
cogs
,
and
levers
,
and
screws
,
and
cylinders
,
and
a
thousand
things
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
my
calling
,
"
said
Daniel
,
amused
,
"
the
greater
usually
includes
the
less
.
 
<EOS>
But
never
mind
,
never
mind
!
 
<EOS>
Whatever
pleases
you
,
pleases
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
could
not
help
speculating
,
as
he
seated
himself
in
his
room
by
the
fire
,
whether
there
might
be
in
the
breast
of
this
honest
,
affectionate
,
and
cordial
Mr
Meagles
,
any
microscopic
portion
of
the
mustard
-
seed
that
had
sprung
up
into
the
great
tree
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
His
curious
sense
of
a
general
superiority
to
Daniel
Doyce
,
which
seemed
to
be
founded
,
not
so
much
on
anything
in
Doyce
's
personal
character
as
on
the
mere
fact
of
his
being
an
originator
and
a
man
out
of
the
beaten
track
of
other
men
,
suggested
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
have
occupied
him
until
he
went
down
to
dinner
an
hour
afterwards
,
if
he
had
not
had
another
question
to
consider
,
which
had
been
in
his
mind
so
long
ago
as
before
he
was
in
quarantine
at
Marseilles
,
and
which
had
now
returned
to
it
,
and
was
very
urgent
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
less
a
question
than
this
:
Whether
he
should
allow
himself
to
fall
in
love
with
Pet
?
   
<EOS>
He
was
twice
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
(
He
changed
the
leg
he
had
crossed
over
the
other
,
and
tried
the
calculation
again
,
but
could
not
bring
out
the
total
at
less
.
)
<EOS>
He
was
twice
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
young
in
appearance
,
young
in
health
and
strength
,
young
in
heart
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
was
certainly
not
old
at
forty
;
and
many
men
were
not
in
circumstances
to
marry
,
or
did
not
marry
,
until
they
had
attained
that
time
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
question
was
,
not
what
he
thought
of
the
point
,
but
what
she
thought
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
believed
that
Mr
Meagles
was
disposed
to
entertain
a
ripe
regard
for
him
,
and
he
knew
that
he
had
a
sincere
regard
for
Mr
Meagles
and
his
good
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
foresee
that
to
relinquish
this
beautiful
only
child
,
of
whom
they
were
so
fond
,
to
any
husband
,
would
be
a
trial
of
their
love
which
perhaps
they
never
yet
had
had
the
fortitude
to
contemplate
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
more
beautiful
and
winning
and
charming
she
,
the
nearer
they
must
always
be
to
the
necessity
of
approaching
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
why
not
in
his
favour
,
as
well
as
in
another
's
?
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
got
so
far
,
it
came
again
into
his
head
that
the
question
was
,
not
what
they
thought
of
it
,
but
what
she
thought
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
was
a
retiring
man
,
with
a
sense
of
many
deficiencies
;
and
he
so
exalted
the
merits
of
the
beautiful
Minnie
in
his
mind
,
and
depressed
his
own
,
that
when
he
pinned
himself
to
this
point
,
his
hopes
began
to
fail
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
to
the
final
resolution
,
as
he
made
himself
ready
for
dinner
,
that
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
fall
in
love
with
Pet
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
only
five
,
at
a
round
table
,
and
it
was
very
pleasant
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
so
many
places
and
people
to
recall
,
and
they
were
all
so
easy
and
cheerful
together
<EOS>
(
Daniel
Doyce
either
sitting
out
like
an
amused
spectator
at
cards
,
or
coming
in
with
some
shrewd
little
experiences
of
his
own
,
when
it
happened
to
be
to
the
purpose
)
,
that
they
might
have
been
together
twenty
times
,
and
not
have
known
so
much
of
one
another

"

said
Mr
Meagles

after
they
had
recalled
a
number
of
fellow
-
travellers
.

"

Wade
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
said
Tattycoram
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
brought
a
little
mantle
which
her
young
mistress
had
sent
for
,
and
was
bending
over
her
,
putting
it
on
,
when
she
lifted
up
her
dark
eyes
and
made
this
unexpected
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tatty
!
"
<EOS>
her
young
mistress
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
seen
Miss
Wade
?
---
<EOS>
where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
miss
,
"
said
Tattycoram
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
   
<EOS>
An
impatient
glance
from
Tattycoram
seemed
,
as
Clennam
saw
it
,
to
answer
"
With
my
eyes
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
her
only
answer
in
words
was
:
"
I
met
her
near
the
church
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
she
doing
there
I
wonder
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
going
to
it
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
had
written
to
me
first
,
"
said
Tattycoram
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tatty
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
her
mistress
,
"
take
your
hands
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
some
one
else
was
touching
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
it
in
a
quick
involuntary
way
,
but
half
playfully
,
and
not
more
petulantly
or
disagreeably
than
a
favourite
child
might
have
done
,
who
laughed
next
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Tattycoram
set
her
full
red
lips
together
,
and
crossed
her
arms
upon
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
wish
to
know
,
sir
,
"
she
said
,
looking
at
Mr
Meagles
,
"
what
Miss
Wade
wrote
to
me
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Tattycoram
,
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
,
"
since
you
ask
the
question
,
and
we
are
all
friends
here
,
<EOS>
perhaps
you
may
as
well
mention
it
,
if
you
are
so
inclined
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
knew
,
when
we
were
travelling
,
where
you
lived
,
"
said
Tattycoram
,
"
and
she
had
seen
me
not
quite
---
not
quite
---
"
   
"
Not
quite
in
a
good
temper
,
Tattycoram
?
<EOS>
"
suggested
Mr
Meagles
,
shaking
his
head
at
the
dark
eyes
with
a
quiet
caution
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
little
time
---
count
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
Tattycoram
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
pressed
her
lips
together
again
,
and
took
a
long
deep
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
she
wrote
to
me
to
say
that
if
I
ever
felt
myself
hurt
,
"
she
looked
down
at
her
young
mistress
,
"
or
found
myself
worried
,
"
she
looked
down
at
her
again
,
"
I
might
go
to
her
,
and
be
considerately
treated
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
think
of
it
,
and
could
speak
to
her
by
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
there
to
thank
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tatty
,
"
said
her
young
mistress
,
putting
her
hand
up
over
her
shoulder
that
the
other
might
take
it
,
"
Miss
Wade
almost
frightened
me
when
we
parted
,
and
I
scarcely
like
to
think
of
her
just
now
as
having
been
so
near
me
without
my
knowing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Tatty
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tatty
stood
for
a
moment
,
immovable
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hey
?
"
cried
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Count
another
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
Tattycoram
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
might
have
counted
a
dozen
,
when
she
bent
and
put
her
lips
to
the
caressing
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
patted
her
cheek
,
as
it
touched
the
owner
's
beautiful
curls
,
and
Tattycoram
went
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
there
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
softly
,
as
he
gave
a
turn
to
the
dumb
-
waiter
on
his
right
hand
to
twirl
the
sugar
towards
himself
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
girl
who
might
be
lost
and
ruined
,
if
she
was
n't
among
practical
people
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
<EOS>
and
I
know
,
solely
from
being
practical
,
that
there
are
times
when
that
girl
's
whole
nature
seems
to
roughen
itself
against
seeing
us
so
bound
up
in
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
No
father
and
mother
were
bound
up
in
her
,
poor
soul
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
think
of
the
way
in
which
that
unfortunate
child
,
with
all
that
passion
and
protest
in
her
,
feels
when
she
hears
the
Fifth
Commandment
on
a
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
always
inclined
to
call
out
,
Church
,
Count
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
Tattycoram
.
"
   
<EOS>
Besides
his
dumb
-
waiter
,
Mr
Meagles
had
two
other
not
dumb
waiters
in
the
persons
of
two
parlour
-
maids
with
rosy
faces
and
bright
eyes
,
who
were
a
highly
ornamental
part
of
the
table
decoration
.
"
<EOS>
And
why
not
,
you
see
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
on
this
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
always
say
to
Mother
,
why
not
have
something
pretty
to
look
at
,
if
you
have
anything
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
certain
Mrs
Tickit
,
who
was
Cook
and
Housekeeper
when
the
family
were
at
home
,
and
Housekeeper
only
when
the
family
were
away
,
completed
the
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
regretted
that
the
nature
of
the
duties
in
which
she
was
engaged
,
rendered
Mrs
Tickit
unpresentable
at
present
,
but
hoped
to
introduce
her
to
the
new
visitor
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
an
important
part
of
the
Cottage
,
he
said
,
and
all
his
friends
knew
her
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
her
picture
up
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
went
away
,
she
always
put
on
the
silk
-
gown
and
the
jet
-
black
row
of
curls
represented
in
that
portrait
<EOS>
(
her
hair
was
reddish
-
grey
in
the
kitchen
)
,
established
herself
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
put
her
spectacles
between
two
particular
leaves
of
Doctor
Buchan
's
Domestic
Medicine
,
and
sat
looking
over
the
blind
all
day
until
they
came
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
supposed
that
no
persuasion
could
be
invented
which
would
induce
Mrs
Tickit
to
abandon
her
post
at
the
blind
,
however
long
their
absence
,
or
to
dispense
with
the
attendance
of
Dr
Buchan
;
the
lucubrations
of
which
learned
practitioner
<EOS>
,
Mr
Meagles
implicitly
believed
she
had
never
yet
consulted
to
the
extent
of
one
word
in
her
life
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
evening
they
played
an
old
-
fashioned
rubber
;
and
Pet
sat
looking
over
her
father
's
hand
,
or
singing
to
herself
by
fits
and
starts
at
the
piano
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
spoilt
child
;
but
how
could
she
be
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
Who
could
be
much
with
so
pliable
and
beautiful
a
creature
,
and
not
yield
to
her
endearing
influence
?
 
<EOS>
Who
could
pass
an
evening
in
the
house
,
and
not
love
her
for
the
grace
and
charm
of
her
very
presence
in
the
room
?
 
<EOS>
This
was
Clennam
's
reflection
,
notwithstanding
the
final
conclusion
at
which
he
had
arrived
up
-
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
In
making
it
,
he
revoked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
are
you
thinking
of
,
my
good
sir
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
astonished
Mr
Meagles
,
who
was
his
partner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
,
"
returned
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Think
of
something
,
next
time
;
that
's
a
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
Pet
laughingly
believed
he
had
been
thinking
of
Miss
Wade
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
of
Miss
Wade
,
Pet
?
"
asked
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
indeed
!
"
said
Arthur
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
Pet
coloured
a
little
,
and
went
to
the
piano
again
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
broke
up
for
the
night
,
Arthur
overheard
Doyce
ask
his
host
if
he
could
give
him
half
an
hour
's
conversation
before
breakfast
in
the
morning
?
 
<EOS>
The
host
replying
willingly
,
Arthur
lingered
behind
a
moment
,
having
his
own
word
to
add
to
that
topic
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Meagles
,
"
he
said
,
on
their
being
left
alone
,
"
do
you
remember
when
you
advised
me
to
go
straight
to
London
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
well
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
when
you
gave
me
some
other
good
advice
which
I
needed
at
that
time
?
"
   
"
I
wo
n't
say
what
it
was
worth
,
"
answered
Mr
Meagles
:
"
<EOS>
but
of
course
I
remember
our
being
very
pleasant
and
confidential
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
acted
on
your
advice
;
and
having
disembarrassed
myself
of
an
occupation
that
was
painful
to
me
for
many
reasons
,
wish
to
devote
myself
and
what
means
I
have
,
to
another
pursuit
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Right
!
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
do
it
too
soon
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
as
I
came
down
to
-
day
,
I
found
that
your
friend
,
Mr
Doyce
,
is
looking
for
a
partner
in
his
business
---
not
a
partner
in
his
mechanical
knowledge
,
but
in
the
ways
and
means
of
turning
the
business
arising
from
it
to
the
best
account
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
with
the
old
business
expression
of
face
that
had
belonged
to
the
scales
and
scoop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Doyce
mentioned
incidentally
,
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
,
that
he
was
going
to
take
your
valuable
advice
on
the
subject
of
finding
such
a
partner
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
think
our
views
and
opportunities
at
all
likely
to
coincide
,
perhaps
you
will
let
him
know
my
available
position
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
,
of
course
,
in
ignorance
of
the
details
,
and
they
may
be
unsuitable
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
with
the
caution
belonging
to
the
scales
and
scoop
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
they
will
be
a
question
of
figures
and
accounts
---
"
   
"
Just
so
,
just
so
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
with
arithmetical
solidity
belonging
to
the
scales
and
scoop
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
I
shall
be
glad
to
enter
into
the
subject
,
provided
Mr
Doyce
responds
,
and
you
think
well
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
at
present
,
therefore
,
allow
me
to
place
it
in
your
hands
,
you
will
much
oblige
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clennam
,
I
accept
the
trust
with
readiness
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
without
anticipating
any
of
the
points
which
you
,
as
a
man
of
business
,
have
of
course
reserved
,
I
am
free
to
say
to
you
that
I
think
something
may
come
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Of
one
thing
you
may
be
perfectly
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Daniel
is
an
honest
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
sure
of
it
that
I
have
promptly
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
must
guide
him
,
you
know
;
you
must
steer
him
;
you
must
direct
him
;
he
is
one
of
a
crotchety
sort
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
evidently
meaning
nothing
more
than
that
he
did
new
things
and
went
new
ways
;
"
but
he
is
as
honest
as
the
sun
,
and
so
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Clennam
went
back
to
his
room
,
sat
down
again
before
his
fire
,
and
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
glad
he
had
resolved
not
to
fall
in
love
with
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
beautiful
,
so
amiable
,
so
apt
to
receive
any
true
impression
given
to
her
gentle
nature
and
her
innocent
heart
,
and
make
the
man
who
should
be
so
happy
as
to
communicate
it
,
the
most
fortunate
and
enviable
of
all
men
,
that
he
was
very
glad
indeed
he
had
come
to
that
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
as
this
might
have
been
a
reason
for
coming
to
the
opposite
conclusion
,
he
followed
out
the
theme
again
a
little
way
in
his
mind
;
to
justify
himself
,
perhaps
.
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
that
a
man
,
"
so
his
thoughts
ran
,
"
who
had
been
of
age
some
twenty
years
or
so
;
who
was
a
diffident
man
,
from
the
circumstances
of
his
youth
;
who
was
rather
a
grave
man
,
from
the
tenor
of
his
life
;
who
knew
himself
to
be
deficient
in
many
little
engaging
qualities
which
he
admired
in
others
,
from
having
been
long
in
a
distant
region
,
with
nothing
softening
near
him
;
who
had
no
kind
sisters
to
present
to
her
;
who
had
no
congenial
home
to
make
her
known
in
;
who
was
a
stranger
in
the
land
;
who
had
not
a
fortune
to
compensate
,
in
any
measure
,
for
these
defects
;
who
had
nothing
in
his
favour
but
his
honest
love
and
his
general
wish
to
do
right
---
<EOS>
suppose
such
a
man
were
to
come
to
this
house
,
and
were
to
yield
to
the
captivation
of
this
charming
girl
,
and
were
to
persuade
himself
that
he
could
hope
to
win
her
;
what
a
weakness
it
would
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
softly
opened
his
window
,
and
looked
out
upon
the
serene
river
.
<EOS>
Year
after
year
so
much
allowance
for
the
drifting
of
the
ferry
-
boat
,
so
many
miles
an
hour
the
flowing
of
the
stream
,
here
the
rushes
,
there
<EOS>
the
lilies
,
nothing
uncertain
or
unquiet
.
   
<EOS>
Why
should
he
be
vexed
or
sore
at
heart
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
weakness
that
he
had
imagined
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nobody
's
,
nobody
's
within
his
knowledge
;
why
should
it
trouble
him
?
 
<EOS>
And
yet
it
did
trouble
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
thought
---
who
has
not
thought
for
a
moment
,
sometimes
?
---
that
it
might
be
better
to
flow
away
monotonously
,
like
the
river
,
and
to
compound
for
its
insensibility
to
happiness
with
its
insensibility
to
pain
.

Before
breakfast
in
the
morning
,
Arthur
walked
out
to
look
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
morning
was
fine
<EOS>
and
he
had
an
hour
on
his
hands
<EOS>
,
he
crossed
the
river
by
the
ferry
,
and
strolled
along
a
footpath
through
some
meadows
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
back
to
the
towing
-
path
,
he
found
the
ferry
-
boat
on
the
opposite
side
,
and
a
gentleman
hailing
it
and
waiting
to
be
taken
over
.
   
<EOS>
This
gentleman
looked
barely
thirty
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
well
dressed
,
of
a
sprightly
and
gay
appearance
,
a
well
-
knit
figure
,
and
a
rich
dark
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
As
Arthur
came
over
the
stile
and
down
to
the
water
's
edge
,
the
lounger
glanced
at
him
for
a
moment
,
and
then
resumed
his
occupation
of
idly
tossing
stones
into
the
water
with
his
foot
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
his
way
of
spurning
them
out
of
their
places
with
his
heel
,
and
getting
them
into
the
required
position
,
that
Clennam
thought
had
an
air
of
cruelty
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
us
have
more
or
less
frequently
derived
a
similar
impression
from
a
man
's
manner
of
doing
some
very
little
thing
:
plucking
a
flower
,
clearing
away
an
obstacle
,
or
even
destroying
an
insentient
object
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
's
thoughts
were
preoccupied
,
as
his
face
showed
,
and
he
took
no
notice
of
a
fine
Newfoundland
dog
,
who
watched
him
attentively
,
and
watched
every
stone
too
,
in
its
turn
,
eager
to
spring
into
the
river
on
receiving
his
master
's
sign
.
 
<EOS>
The
ferry
-
boat
came
over
,
however
,
without
his
receiving
any
sign
,
and
when
it
grounded
his
master
took
him
by
the
collar
and
walked
him
into
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
this
morning
,
"
he
said
to
the
dog
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
do
for
ladies
'
company
,
dripping
wet
.
 
<EOS>
Lie
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
followed
the
man
and
the
dog
into
the
boat
,
and
took
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
did
as
he
was
ordered
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
remained
standing
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
towered
between
Clennam
and
the
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
Man
and
dog
both
jumped
lightly
out
as
soon
as
they
touched
the
other
side
,
and
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
The
church
clock
struck
the
breakfast
hour
as
he
walked
up
the
little
lane
by
which
the
garden
-
gate
was
approached
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
he
pulled
the
bell
a
deep
loud
barking
assailed
him
from
within
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
heard
no
dog
last
night
,
"
thought
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
The
gate
was
opened
by
one
of
the
rosy
maids
,
and
on
the
lawn
were
the
Newfoundland
dog
and
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Minnie
is
not
down
yet
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
blushing
portress
,
as
they
all
came
together
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
said
to
the
master
of
the
dog
,
"
Mr
Clennam
,
sir
,
"
and
tripped
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Odd
enough
,
Mr
Clennam
,
that
we
should
have
met
just
now
,
"
said
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
the
dog
became
mute
.
 
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
introduce
myself
---
Henry
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
A
pretty
place
this
,
and
looks
wonderfully
well
this
morning
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
manner
was
easy
,
and
the
voice
agreeable
;
but
still
Clennam
thought
,
that
if
he
had
not
made
that
decided
resolution
to
avoid
falling
in
love
with
Pet
,
he
would
have
taken
a
dislike
to
this
Henry
Gowan
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
new
to
you
,
I
believe
?
"
said
this
Gowan
,
when
Arthur
had
extolled
the
place
.
"
<EOS>
Quite
new
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
acquaintance
with
it
only
yesterday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Of
course
this
is
not
its
best
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
It
used
to
look
charming
in
the
spring
,
before
they
went
away
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
have
seen
it
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
for
that
resolution
so
often
recalled
,
Clennam
might
have
wished
him
in
the
crater
of
Mount
Etna
,
in
return
for
this
civility
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
it
under
many
circumstances
during
the
last
three
years
,
and
it
's
---
a
Paradise
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
(
at
least
it
might
have
been
,
always
excepting
for
that
wise
resolution
)
like
his
dexterous
impudence
to
call
it
a
Paradise
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
called
it
a
Paradise
because
he
first
saw
her
coming
,
and
so
made
her
out
within
her
hearing
to
be
an
angel
,
Confusion
to
him
!
<EOS>
And
ah
!
 
<EOS>
how
beaming
she
looked
,
and
how
glad
!
 
<EOS>
How
she
caressed
the
dog
,
and
how
the
dog
knew
her
!
 
<EOS>
How
expressive
that
heightened
colour
in
her
face
,
that
fluttered
manner
,
her
downcast
eyes
,
her
irresolute
happiness
!
 
<EOS>
When
had
Clennam
seen
her
look
like
this
?
<EOS>
Not
that
there
was
any
reason
why
he
might
,
could
,
would
,
or
should
have
ever
seen
her
look
like
this
,
or
that
he
had
ever
hoped
for
himself
to
see
her
look
like
this
;
but
still
---
when
had
he
ever
known
her
do
it
!
   
<EOS>
He
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
Gowan
when
he
had
talked
about
a
Paradise
,
had
gone
up
to
her
and
taken
her
hand
.
<EOS>
The
dog
had
put
his
great
paws
on
her
arm
and
laid
his
head
against
her
dear
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
laughed
and
welcomed
them
,
and
made
far
too
much
of
the
dog
,
far
,
far
,
too
much
---
that
is
to
say
,
supposing
there
had
been
any
third
person
looking
on
who
loved
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
disengaged
herself
now
,
and
came
to
Clennam
,
and
put
her
hand
in
his
and
wished
him
good
morning
,
and
gracefully
made
as
if
she
would
take
his
arm
and
be
escorted
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
Gowan
had
no
objection
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
he
knew
he
was
too
safe
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
passing
cloud
on
Mr
Meagles
's
good
-
humoured
face
when
they
all
three
(
four
,
counting
the
dog
,
and
he
was
the
most
objectionable
but
one
of
the
party
)
came
in
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
it
,
nor
the
touch
of
uneasiness
on
Mrs
Meagles
as
she
directed
her
eyes
towards
it
,
was
unobserved
by
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Gowan
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
even
suppressing
a
sigh
;
"
how
goes
the
world
with
you
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Much
as
usual
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Lion
and
I
being
determined
not
to
waste
anything
of
our
weekly
visit
,
turned
out
early
,
and
came
over
from
Kingston
,
my
present
headquarters
,
where
I
am
making
a
sketch
or
two
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
told
how
he
had
met
Mr
Clennam
at
the
ferry
,
and
they
had
come
over
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
is
well
,
Henry
?
"
said
Mrs
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
(
Clennam
became
attentive
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
My
mother
is
quite
well
,
thank
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
(
Clennam
became
inattentive
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
the
liberty
of
making
an
addition
to
your
family
dinner
-
party
to
-
day
,
which
I
hope
will
not
be
inconvenient
to
you
or
to
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
very
well
get
out
of
it
,
"
he
explained
,
turning
to
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
young
fellow
wrote
to
propose
himself
to
me
;
and
as
he
is
well
connected
,
I
thought
you
would
not
object
to
my
transferring
him
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
young
fellow
?
"
asked
Mr
Meagles
with
peculiar
complacency
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
one
of
the
Barnacles
.
 
<EOS>
Tite
Barnacle
's
son
,
Clarence
Barnacle
,
who
is
in
his
father
's
Department
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
at
least
guarantee
that
the
river
shall
not
suffer
from
his
visit
.
 
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
set
it
on
fire
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
?
"
said
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
Barnacle
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
We
know
something
of
that
family
,
eh
,
Dan
?
 
<EOS>
By
George
,
they
are
at
the
top
of
the
tree
,
though
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
What
relation
will
this
young
fellow
be
to
Lord
Decimus
now
?
 
<EOS>
His
Lordship
married
,
in
seventeen
ninety
-
seven
,
Lady
Jemima
Bilberry
,
who
was
the
second
daughter
by
the
third
marriage
---
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
There
I
am
wrong
!
 
<EOS>
That
was
Lady
Seraphina
---
<EOS>
Lady
Jemima
was
the
first
daughter
by
the
second
marriage
of
the
fifteenth
Earl
of
Stiltstalking
with
the
Honourable
Clementina
Toozellem
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Now
this
young
fellow
's
father
married
<EOS>
a
Stiltstalking
and
his
father
married
his
cousin
who
was
a
Barnacle
.
   
<EOS>
The
father
of
that
father
who
married
a
Barnacle
,
married
a
Joddleby
.
<EOS>
---
I
am
getting
a
little
too
far
back
,
Gowan
;
I
want
to
make
out
what
relation
<EOS>
this
young
fellow
is
to
Lord
Decimus
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
easily
stated
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
is
nephew
to
Lord
Decimus
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nephew
---
to
---
Lord
---
Decimus
,
"
Mr
Meagles
luxuriously
repeated
with
his
eyes
shut
,
that
he
might
have
nothing
to
distract
him
from
the
full
flavour
of
the
genealogical
tree
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
George
,
you
are
right
,
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Consequently
,
Lord
Decimus
is
his
great
uncle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
stop
a
bit
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
opening
his
eyes
with
a
fresh
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
on
the
mother
's
side
,
Lady
Stiltstalking
is
his
great
aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
aye
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
with
much
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
We
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
entertain
him
as
well
as
we
can
,
in
our
humble
way
;
and
we
shall
not
starve
him
,
I
hope
,
at
all
events
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
this
dialogue
,
Clennam
had
expected
some
great
harmless
outburst
from
Mr
Meagles
,
like
that
which
had
made
him
burst
out
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
holding
Doyce
by
the
collar
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
good
friend
had
a
weakness
which
none
of
us
need
go
into
the
next
street
to
find
,
and
which
no
amount
of
Circumlocution
experience
could
long
subdue
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
looked
at
Doyce
;
but
Doyce
knew
all
about
it
beforehand
,
and
looked
at
his
plate
,
and
made
no
sign
,
and
said
no
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
"
said
Gowan
,
to
conclude
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
Clarence
is
a
great
ass
,
but
he
is
one
of
the
dearest
and
best
fellows
that
ever
lived
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
before
the
breakfast
was
over
,
that
everybody
whom
this
Gowan
knew
was
either
more
or
less
of
an
ass
,
or
more
or
less
of
a
knave
;
but
was
,
notwithstanding
,
the
most
lovable
,
the
most
engaging
,
the
simplest
,
truest
,
kindest
,
dearest
,
best
fellow
that
ever
lived
.
 
<EOS>
The
process
by
which
this
unvarying
result
was
attained
,
whatever
the
premises
,
might
have
been
stated
by
Mr
Henry
Gowan
thus
:
"
I
claim
to
be
always
book
-
keeping
,
with
a
peculiar
nicety
,
in
every
man
's
case
,
and
posting
up
a
careful
little
account
of
Good
and
Evil
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
this
so
conscientiously
,
that
I
am
happy
to
tell
you
I
find
the
most
worthless
of
men
to
be
the
dearest
old
fellow
too
:
and
am
in
a
condition
to
make
the
gratifying
report
,
that
there
is
much
less
difference
than
you
are
inclined
to
suppose
between
an
honest
man
and
a
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
effect
of
this
cheering
discovery
happened
to
be
,
that
while
he
seemed
to
be
scrupulously
finding
good
in
most
men
,
he
did
in
reality
lower
it
where
it
was
,
and
set
it
up
where
it
was
not
;
but
that
was
its
only
disagreeable
or
dangerous
feature
.
   
<EOS>
It
scarcely
seemed
,
however
,
to
afford
Mr
Meagles
as
much
satisfaction
as
the
Barnacle
genealogy
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
The
cloud
that
Clennam
had
never
seen
upon
his
face
before
that
morning
,
frequently
overcast
it
again
;
and
there
was
the
same
shadow
of
uneasy
observation
of
him
on
the
comely
face
of
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
once
or
twice
when
Pet
caressed
the
dog
,
it
appeared
to
Clennam
that
her
father
was
unhappy
in
seeing
her
do
it
;
and
,
in
one
particular
instance
when
Gowan
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
dog
,
and
bent
his
head
at
the
same
time
,
Arthur
fancied
that
he
saw
tears
rise
to
Mr
Meagles
's
eyes
as
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
either
the
fact
too
,
or
he
fancied
further
,
that
Pet
herself
was
not
insensible
to
these
little
incidents
;
that
she
tried
,
with
a
more
delicate
affection
than
usual
,
to
express
to
her
good
father
how
much
she
loved
him
;
that
it
was
on
this
account
that
she
fell
behind
the
rest
,
both
as
they
went
to
church
and
as
they
returned
from
it
,
and
took
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
sworn
but
that
as
he
walked
alone
in
the
garden
afterwards
,
he
had
an
instantaneous
glimpse
of
her
in
her
father
's
room
,
clinging
to
both
her
parents
with
the
greatest
tenderness
,
and
weeping
on
her
father
's
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
The
latter
part
of
the
day
turning
out
wet
,
they
were
fain
to
keep
the
house
,
look
over
Mr
Meagles
's
collection
,
and
beguile
the
time
with
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
This
Gowan
had
plenty
to
say
for
himself
,
and
said
it
in
an
off
-
hand
and
amusing
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
be
an
artist
by
profession
,
and
to
have
been
at
Rome
some
time
;
yet
he
had
a
slight
,
careless
,
amateur
way
with
him
---
a
perceptible
limp
,
both
in
his
devotion
to
art
and
his
attainments
---
which
Clennam
could
scarcely
understand
.
   
<EOS>
He
applied
to
Daniel
Doyce
for
help
,
as
they
stood
together
,
looking
out
of
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
Mr
Gowan
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
him
here
.
 
<EOS>
Comes
here
every
Sunday
when
they
are
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
An
artist
,
I
infer
from
what
he
says
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
sort
of
a
one
,
"
said
Daniel
Doyce
,
in
a
surly
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
a
one
?
"
asked
Clennam
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
has
sauntered
into
the
Arts
at
a
leisurely
Pall
-
Mall
pace
,
"
said
Doyce
,
"
and
I
doubt
if
they
care
to
be
taken
quite
so
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Pursuing
his
inquiries
,
Clennam
found
that
the
Gowan
family
were
a
very
distant
ramification
of
the
Barnacles
;
and
that
the
paternal
Gowan
,
originally
attached
to
a
legation
abroad
,
had
been
pensioned
off
as
a
Commissioner
of
nothing
particular
somewhere
or
other
,
and
had
died
at
his
post
with
his
drawn
salary
in
his
hand
,
nobly
defending
it
to
the
last
extremity
.
 
<EOS>
In
consideration
of
this
eminent
public
service
,
the
Barnacle
then
in
power
had
recommended
the
Crown
to
bestow
a
pension
of
two
or
three
hundred
a
-
year
on
his
widow
;
to
which
the
next
Barnacle
in
power
had
added
certain
shady
and
sedate
apartments
in
the
Palaces
at
Hampton
Court
,
where
the
old
lady
still
lived
,
deploring
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
in
company
with
several
other
old
ladies
of
both
sexes
.
 
<EOS>
Her
son
,
Mr
Henry
Gowan
,
inheriting
from
his
father
,
the
Commissioner
,
that
very
questionable
help
in
life
,
a
very
small
independence
,
had
been
difficult
to
settle
;
the
rather
,
as
public
appointments
chanced
to
be
scarce
,
and
his
genius
,
during
his
earlier
manhood
,
was
of
that
exclusively
agricultural
character
which
applies
itself
to
the
cultivation
of
wild
oats
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
had
declared
that
he
would
become
a
Painter
;
partly
because
he
had
always
had
an
idle
knack
that
way
,
and
partly
to
grieve
the
souls
of
the
Barnacles
-
in
-
chief
who
had
not
provided
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
had
come
to
pass
successively
,
first
,
that
several
distinguished
ladies
had
been
frightfully
shocked
;
then
,
that
portfolios
of
his
performances
had
been
handed
about
o
'
nights
,
and
declared
with
ecstasy
to
be
perfect
Claudes
,
perfect
Cuyps
,
perfect
phaenomena
;
then
,
that
Lord
Decimus
had
bought
his
picture
,
and
had
asked
the
President
and
Council
to
dinner
at
a
blow
,
and
had
said
,
with
his
own
magnificent
gravity
,
"
Do
you
know
,
there
appears
to
me
to
be
really
immense
merit
in
that
work
?
"
<EOS>
and
,
in
short
,
that
people
of
condition
had
absolutely
taken
pains
to
bring
him
into
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
somehow
,
it
had
all
failed
.
 
<EOS>
The
prejudiced
public
had
stood
out
against
it
obstinately
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
determined
not
to
admire
Lord
Decimus
's
picture
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
determined
to
believe
that
in
every
service
,
except
their
own
,
a
man
must
qualify
himself
,
by
striving
early
and
late
,
and
by
working
heart
and
soul
,
might
and
main
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
Mr
Gowan
,
like
that
worn
-
out
old
coffin
which
never
was
Mahomet
's
nor
anybody
else
's
,
hung
midway
between
two
points
:
jaundiced
and
jealous
as
to
the
one
he
had
left
:
jaundiced
and
jealous
as
to
the
other
that
he
could
n't
reach
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
substance
of
Clennam
's
discoveries
concerning
him
,
made
that
rainy
Sunday
afternoon
and
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
About
an
hour
or
so
after
dinner
time
,
Young
Barnacle
appeared
,
attended
by
his
eye
-
glass
;
in
honour
of
whose
family
connections
,
Mr
Meagles
had
cashiered
the
pretty
parlour
-
maids
for
the
day
,
and
had
placed
on
duty
in
their
stead
two
dingy
men
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Barnacle
was
in
the
last
degree
amazed
and
disconcerted
at
sight
of
Arthur
,
and
had
murmured
involuntarily
,
"
Look
here
!
 
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
"
before
his
presence
of
mind
returned
.
   
<EOS>
Even
then
,
he
was
obliged
to
embrace
the
earliest
opportunity
of
taking
his
friend
into
a
window
,
and
saying
,
in
a
nasal
way
that
was
a
part
of
his
general
debility
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
.
 
<EOS>
Who
is
that
fellow
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
friend
of
our
host
's
.
 
None
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
most
ferocious
Radical
,
you
know
,
"
said
Young
Barnacle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
?
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
know
?
"
   
"
Ecod
,
sir
,
he
was
Pitching
into
our
people
the
other
day
in
the
most
tremendous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Went
up
to
our
place
and
Pitched
into
my
father
to
that
extent
that
it
was
necessary
to
order
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
Came
back
to
our
Department
,
and
Pitched
into
me
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
saw
such
a
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
want
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
,
sir
,
"
returned
Young
Barnacle
,
"
he
said
he
wanted
to
know
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
Pervaded
our
Department
---
without
an
appointment
---
and
said
he
wanted
to
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
stare
of
indignant
wonder
with
which
Young
Barnacle
accompanied
this
disclosure
,
would
have
strained
his
eyes
injuriously
but
for
the
opportune
relief
of
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
(
who
had
been
extremely
solicitous
to
know
how
his
uncle
and
aunt
were
)
begged
him
to
conduct
Mrs
Meagles
to
the
dining
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
sat
on
Mrs
Meagles
's
right
hand
,
Mr
Meagles
looked
as
gratified
as
if
his
whole
family
were
there
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
natural
charm
of
the
previous
day
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
The
eaters
of
the
dinner
,
like
the
dinner
itself
,
were
lukewarm
,
insipid
,
overdone
---
and
all
owing
to
this
poor
little
dull
Young
Barnacle
.
<EOS>
Conversationless
at
any
time
,
he
was
now
the
victim
of
a
weakness
special
to
the
occasion
,
and
solely
referable
to
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
under
a
pressing
and
continual
necessity
of
looking
at
that
gentleman
,
which
occasioned
his
eye
-
glass
to
get
into
his
soup
,
into
his
wine
-
glass
,
into
Mrs
Meagles
's
plate
,
to
hang
down
his
back
like
a
bell
-
rope
,
and
be
several
times
disgracefully
restored
to
his
bosom
by
one
of
the
dingy
men
.
 
<EOS>
Weakened
in
mind
by
his
frequent
losses
of
this
instrument
,
and
its
determination
not
to
stick
in
his
eye
,
and
more
and
more
enfeebled
in
intellect
every
time
he
looked
at
the
mysterious
Clennam
,
he
applied
spoons
to
his
eyes
,
forks
,
and
other
foreign
matters
connected
with
the
furniture
of
the
dinner
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
His
discovery
of
these
mistakes
greatly
increased
his
difficulties
,
but
never
released
him
from
the
necessity
of
looking
at
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
And
whenever
Clennam
spoke
,
this
ill
-
starred
young
man
was
clearly
seized
with
a
dread
that
he
was
coming
,
by
some
artful
device
,
<EOS>
round
to
that
point
of
wanting
to
know
,
you
know
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
be
questioned
,
therefore
,
whether
any
one
but
Mr
Meagles
had
much
enjoyment
of
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
however
,
thoroughly
enjoyed
Young
Barnacle
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
mere
flask
of
the
golden
water
in
the
tale
became
a
full
fountain
when
it
was
poured
out
,
so
Mr
Meagles
seemed
to
feel
that
this
small
spice
of
Barnacle
imparted
to
his
table
the
flavour
of
the
whole
family
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
In
its
presence
,
his
frank
,
fine
,
genuine
qualities
paled
;
he
was
not
so
easy
,
he
was
not
so
natural
,
he
was
striving
after
something
that
did
not
belong
to
him
,
he
was
not
himself
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
strange
peculiarity
on
the
part
of
Mr
Meagles
,
and
where
should
we
find
another
such
case
!
   
<EOS>
At
last
the
wet
Sunday
wore
itself
out
in
a
wet
night
;
and
Young
Barnacle
went
home
in
a
cab
,
feebly
smoking
;
and
the
objectionable
Gowan
went
away
on
foot
,
accompanied
by
the
objectionable
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Pet
had
taken
the
most
amiable
pains
all
day
to
be
friendly
with
Clennam
,
but
Clennam
had
been
a
little
reserved
since
breakfast
<EOS>
---
that
is
to
say
,
would
have
been
,
if
he
had
loved
her
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
gone
to
his
own
room
,
and
had
again
thrown
himself
into
the
chair
by
the
fire
,
Mr
Doyce
knocked
at
the
door
,
candle
in
hand
,
to
ask
him
how
and
at
what
hour
he
proposed
returning
on
the
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
After
settling
this
question
,
he
said
a
word
to
Mr
Doyce
about
this
Gowan
---
who
would
have
run
in
his
head
a
good
deal
,
if
he
had
been
his
rival
.
   
<EOS>
"
Those
are
not
good
prospects
for
a
painter
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Doyce
stood
,
chamber
-
candlestick
in
hand
,
the
other
hand
in
his
pocket
,
looking
hard
at
the
flame
of
his
candle
,
with
a
certain
quiet
perception
in
his
face
that
they
were
going
to
say
something
more
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
our
good
friend
a
little
changed
,
and
out
of
spirits
,
after
he
came
this
morning
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
not
his
daughter
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
on
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Doyce
,
still
looking
at
the
flame
of
his
candle
,
slowly
resumed
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
he
has
twice
taken
his
daughter
abroad
in
the
hope
of
separating
her
from
Mr
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
He
rather
thinks
she
is
disposed
to
like
him
,
and
he
has
painful
doubts
<EOS>
(
I
quite
agree
with
him
,
as
I
dare
say
you
do
)
of
the
hopefulness
of
such
a
marriage
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
---
"
Clennam
choked
,
and
coughed
,
and
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
have
taken
cold
,
"
said
Daniel
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
But
without
looking
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
an
engagement
between
them
,
of
course
?
"
said
Clennam
airily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
am
told
,
certainly
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
solicited
on
the
gentleman
's
part
,
but
none
has
been
made
.
 
<EOS>
Since
their
recent
return
,
our
friend
has
yielded
to
a
weekly
visit
,
but
that
is
the
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
Minnie
would
not
deceive
her
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
travelled
with
them
,
and
I
believe
you
know
what
a
bond
there
is
among
them
,
extending
even
beyond
this
present
life
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
there
is
between
Miss
Minnie
and
Mr
Gowan
,
I
have
no
doubt
we
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
We
see
enough
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Doyce
wished
him
Good
Night
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
had
heard
a
mournful
,
not
to
say
despairing
,
exclamation
,
and
who
sought
to
infuse
some
encouragement
and
hope
into
the
mind
of
the
person
by
whom
it
had
been
uttered
.
 
<EOS>
Such
tone
was
probably
a
part
of
his
oddity
,
as
one
of
a
crotchety
band
;
for
how
could
he
have
heard
anything
of
that
kind
,
without
Clennam
's
hearing
it
too
?
   
<EOS>
The
rain
fell
heavily
on
the
roof
,
and
pattered
on
the
ground
,
and
dripped
among
the
evergreens
and
the
leafless
branches
of
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
fell
heavily
,
drearily
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
night
of
tears
.
   
<EOS>
If
Clennam
had
not
decided
against
falling
in
love
with
Pet
;
if
he
had
had
the
weakness
to
do
it
;
if
he
had
,
little
by
little
,
persuaded
himself
to
set
all
the
earnestness
of
his
nature
,
all
the
might
of
his
hope
,
and
all
the
wealth
of
his
matured
character
,
on
that
cast
;
if
he
had
done
this
and
found
that
all
was
lost
;
he
would
have
been
,
that
night
,
unutterably
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
---
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
the
rain
fell
heavily
,
drearily

Little
Dorrit
's
Lover
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
had
not
attained
her
twenty
-
second
birthday
without
finding
a
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
the
shallow
Marshalsea
,
the
ever
young
Archer
shot
off
a
few
featherless
arrows
now
and
then
from
a
mouldy
bow
,
and
winged
a
Collegian
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
's
lover
,
however
,
was
not
a
Collegian
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
sentimental
son
of
a
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
hoped
,
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
to
leave
him
the
inheritance
of
an
unstained
key
;
and
had
from
his
early
youth
familiarised
him
with
the
duties
of
his
office
,
and
with
an
ambition
to
retain
the
prison
-
lock
in
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
succession
was
yet
in
abeyance
,
he
assisted
his
mother
in
the
conduct
of
a
snug
tobacco
business
round
the
corner
of
Horsemonger
Lane
(
his
father
being
a
non
-
resident
turnkey
)
,
which
could
usually
command
a
neat
connection
within
the

Years
agone
,
when
the
object
of
his
affections
was
wo
nt
to
sit
in
her
little
arm
-
chair
by
the
high
Lodge
-
fender
,
Young
John
(
family
name
,
Chivery
)
,
a
year
older
than
herself
,
had
eyed
her
with
admiring
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
played
with
her
in
the
yard
,
his
favourite
game
had
been
to
counterfeit
locking
her
up
in
corners
,
and
to
counterfeit
letting
her
out
for
real
kisses
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
grew
tall
enough
to
peep
through
the
keyhole
of
the
great
lock
of
the
main
door
,
he
had
<EOS>
divers
times
set
down
his
father
's
dinner
,
or
supper
,
to
get
on
as
it
might
on
the
outer
side
thereof
,
while
he
stood
taking
cold
in
one
eye
by
dint
of
peeping
at
her
through
that
airy
perspective
.
   
<EOS>
If
Young
John
had
ever
slackened
in
his
truth
in
the
less
penetrable
days
of
his
boyhood
,
when
youth
is
prone
to
wear
its
boots
unlaced
and
is
happily
unconscious
of
digestive
organs
,
he
had
soon
strung
it
up
again
and
screwed
it
tight
.
 
<EOS>
At
nineteen
,
his
hand
had
inscribed
in
chalk
on
that
part
of
the
wall
which
fronted
her
lodgings
,
on
the
occasion
of
her
birthday
,
"
Welcome
sweet
nursling
of
the
Fairies
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
twenty
-
three
,
the
same
hand
falteringly
presented
cigars
on
Sundays
to
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
and
Father
of
the
queen
of
his
soul
.
   
<EOS>
Young
John
was
small
of
stature
,
with
rather
weak
legs
and
very
weak
light
hair
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
his
eyes
(
perhaps
the
eye
that
used
to
peep
through
the
keyhole
)
was
also
weak
,
and
looked
larger
than
the
other
,
as
if
it
could
n't
collect
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Young
John
was
gentle
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
great
of
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Poetical
,
expansive
,
faithful
.
   
<EOS>
Though
too
humble
before
the
ruler
of
his
heart
to
be
sanguine
,
Young
John
had
considered
the
object
of
his
attachment
in
all
its
lights
and
shades
.
 
<EOS>
Following
it
out
to
blissful
results
,
he
had
descried
,
without
self
-
commendation
,
a
fitness
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Say
things
prospered
,
and
they
were
united
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
the
child
of
the
Marshalsea
;
he
,
the
lock
-
keeper
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fitness
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
Say
he
became
a
resident
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
officially
succeed
to
the
chamber
she
had
rented
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
beautiful
propriety
in
that
.
<EOS>
It
looked
over
the
wall
,
if
you
stood
on
tip
-
toe
;
and
,
with
a
trellis
-
work
of
scarlet
beans
and
a
canary
or
so
,
would
become
a
very
Arbour
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
charming
idea
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
being
all
in
all
to
one
another
,
there
was
even
an
appropriate
grace
in
the
lock
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
world
shut
out
(
except
that
part
of
it
which
would
be
shut
in
)
;
with
its
troubles
and
disturbances
only
known
to
them
by
hearsay
,
as
they
would
be
described
by
the
pilgrims
tarrying
with
them
on
their
way
to
the
Insolvent
Shrine
;
with
the
Arbour
above
,
and
the
Lodge
below
;
they
would
glide
down
the
stream
of
time
,
in
pastoral
domestic
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Young
John
drew
tears
from
his
eyes
by
finishing
the
picture
with
a
tombstone
in
the
adjoining
churchyard
,
close
against
the
prison
wall
,
bearing
the
following
touching
inscription
:
"
Sacred

the
Memory

CHIVERY

Sixty

Who
departed

on

first
of
December
,
One
thousand
eight
hundred

Aged

whose

was
DORRIT

Who
survived

not
quite
forty

eight

And
who
breathed

"
   
<EOS>
The
Chivery
parents
were
not
ignorant
of
their
son
's
attachment
 
---
<EOS>
indeed
it
had
,
on
some
exceptional
occasions
,
thrown
him
into
a
state
of
mind
that
had
impelled
him
to
conduct
himself
with
irascibility
towards
the
customers
,
and
damage
the
business
---
but
they
,
in
their
turns
,
had
worked
it
out
to
desirable
conclusions
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Chivery
,
a
prudent
woman
,
had
desired
her
husband
to
take
notice
that
their
john
's
prospects
of
the
Lock
would
certainly
be
strengthened
by
an
alliance
with
Miss
Dorrit
,
who
had
herself
a
kind
of
claim
upon
the
College
and
was
much
respected
there
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Chivery
had
desired
her
husband
to
take
notice
that
if
,
on
the
one
hand
,
their
John
had
means
and
a
post
of
trust
,
on
the
other
hand
,
Miss
Dorrit
had
family
;
and
that
her
<EOS>
(
Mrs
Chivery
's
)
sentiment
was
,
that
two
halves
made
a
whole
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Chivery
,
speaking
as
a
mother
and
not
as
a
diplomatist
,
had
then
,
from
a
different
point
of
view
,
desired
her
husband
to
recollect
that
their
John
had
never
been
strong
,
and
that
his
love
had
fretted
and
worrited
him
enough
as
it
was
,
without
his
being
driven
to
do
himself
a
mischief
,
as
nobody
could
n't
say
he
would
n't
be
if
he
was
crossed
.
 
<EOS>
These
arguments
had
so
powerfully
influenced
the
mind
of
Mr
Chivery
,
who
was
a
man
of
few
words
,
that
he
had
on
sundry
Sunday
mornings
,
given
his
boy
what
he
termed
"
a
lucky
touch
,
"
signifying
that
he
considered
such
commendation
of
him
to
Good
Fortune
,
preparatory
to
his
that
day
declaring
his
passion
and
becoming
triumphant
.
 
<EOS>
But
Young
John
had
never
taken
courage
to
make
the
declaration
;
and
it
was
principally
on
these
occasions
that
he
had
returned
excited
to
the
tobacco
shop
,
and
flown
at
the
customers
.
<EOS>
In
this
affair
,
as
in
every
other
,
Little
Dorrit
herself
was
the
last
person
considered
.
 
<EOS>
Her
brother
and
sister
were
aware
of
it
,
and
attained
a
sort
of
station
by
making
a
peg
of
it
on
which
to
air
the
miserably
ragged
old
fiction
of
the
family
gentility
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
asserted
the
family
gentility
by
flouting
the
poor
swain
as
he
loitered
about
the
prison
for
glimpses
of
his
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Tip
asserted
the
family
gentility
,
and
his
own
,
by
coming
out
in
the
character
of
the
aristocratic
brother
,
and
loftily
swaggering
in
the
little
skittle
ground
respecting
seizures
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
,
which
there
were
looming
probabilities
of
some
gentleman
unknown
executing
on
some
little
puppy
not
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
not
the
only
members
of
the
Dorrit
family
who
turned
it
to
account
.
   
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
was
supposed
to
know
nothing
about
the
matter
,
of
course
:
his
poor
dignity
could
not
see
so
low
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
took
the
cigars
,
on
Sundays
,
and
was
glad
to
get
them
;
and
sometimes
even
condescended
to
walk
up
and
down
the
yard
with
the
donor
(
who
was
proud
and
hopeful
then
)
,
and
benignantly
to
smoke
one
in
his
society
.
 
<EOS>
With
no
less
readiness
and
condescension
did
he
receive
attentions
from
Chivery
Senior
,
who
always
relinquished
his
arm
-
chair
and
newspaper
to
him
,
when
he
came
into
the
Lodge
during
one
of
his
spells
of
duty
;
and
who
had
even
mentioned
to
him
,
that
,
if
he
would
like
at
any
time
after
dusk
quietly
to
step
out
into
the
fore
-
court
and
take
a
look
at
the
street
,
there
was
not
much
to
prevent
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
this
latter
civility
,
it
was
only
because
he
had
lost
the
relish
for
it
;
inasmuch
as
he
took
everything
else
he
could
get
,
and
would
say
at
times
,
"
Extremely
civil
person
,
Chivery
;
very
attentive
man
and
very
respectful
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Chivery
,
too
;
really
almost
with
a
delicate
perception
of
one
's
position
here
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
well
conducted
family
indeed
,
the
Chiveries
.
 
<EOS>
Their
behaviour
gratifies
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
devoted
Young
John
all
this
time
regarded
the
family
with
reverence
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
dreamed
of
disputing
their
pretensions
,
but
did
homage
to
the
miserable
Mumbo
jumbo
they
paraded
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
resenting
any
affront
from
her
brother
,
he
would
have
felt
,
even
if
he
had
not
naturally
been
of
a
most
pacific
disposition
,
that
to
wag
his
tongue
or
lift
his
hand
against
that
sacred
gentleman
would
be
an
unhallowed
act
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sorry
that
his
noble
mind
should
take
offence
;
still
,
he
felt
the
fact
to
be
not
incompatible
with
its
nobility
,
and
sought
to
propitiate
and
conciliate
that
gallant
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
,
a
gentleman
in
misfortune
---
a
gentleman
of
a
fine
spirit
and
courtly
manners
,
who
always
bore
with
him
<EOS>
---
he
deeply
honoured
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
he
considered
somewhat
vain
and
proud
,
but
a
young
lady
of
infinite
accomplishments
,
who
could
not
forget
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
instinctive
testimony
to
Little
Dorrit
's
worth
and
difference
from
all
the
rest
,
that
the
poor
young
fellow
honoured
and
loved
her
for
being
simply
what
she
was
.
   
<EOS>
The
tobacco
business
round
the
corner
of
Horsemonger
Lane
was
carried
out
in
a
rural
establishment
one
story
high
,
which
had
the
benefit
of
the
air
from
the
yards
of
Horsemonger
Lane
jail
,
and
the
advantage
of
a
retired
walk
under
the
wall
of
that
pleasant
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
The
business
was
of
too
modest
a
character
to
support
a
life
-
size
Highlander
,
but
it
maintained
a
little
one
on
a
bracket
on
the
door
-
post
,
who
looked
like
a
fallen
Cherub
that
had
found
it
necessary
to
take
to
a
kilt
.
<EOS>
From
the
portal
thus
decorated
,
one
Sunday
after
an
early
dinner
of
baked
viands
,
Young
John
issued
forth
on
his
usual
Sunday
errand
;
not
empty
-
handed
,
but
with
his
offering
of
cigars
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
neatly
attired
in
a
plum
-
coloured
coat
,
with
as
large
a
collar
of
black
velvet
as
his
figure
could
carry
;
a
silken
waistcoat
,
bedecked
with
golden
sprigs
;
a
chaste
neckerchief
much
in
vogue
at
that
day
,
representing
a
preserve
of
lilac
pheasants
on
a
buff
ground
;
pantaloons
so
highly
decorated
with
side
-
stripes
that
each
leg
was
a
three
-
stringed
lute
;
and
a
hat
of
state
very
high
and
hard
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
prudent
Mrs
Chivery
perceived
that
in
addition
to
these
adornments
her
John
carried
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
,
and
a
cane
like
a
little
finger
-
post
,
surmounted
by
an
ivory
hand
marshalling
him
the
way
that
he
should
go
;
and
when
she
saw
him
,
in
this
heavy
marching
order
,
turn
the
corner
to
the
right
;
she
remarked
to
Mr
Chivery
,
who
was
at
home
at
the
time
,
that
she
thought
she
knew
which
way
the
wind
blew
.
   
<EOS>
The
Collegians
were
entertaining
a
considerable
number
of
visitors
that
Sunday
afternoon
,
and
their
Father
kept
his
room
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
presentations
.
 
<EOS>
After
making
the
tour
of
the
yard
,
Little
Dorrit
's
lover
with
a
hurried
heart
went
up
-
stairs
,
and
knocked
with
his
knuckles
at
the
Father
's
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
come
in
!
"
said
a
gracious
voice
.
 
<EOS>
The
Father
's
voice
,
her
father
's
,
the
Marshalsea
's
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
seated
in
his
black
velvet
cap
,
with
his
newspaper
,
three
-
and
-
sixpence
accidentally
left
on
the
table
,
and
two
chairs
arranged
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
prepared
for
holding
his
Court
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah

Young
John

<EOS>
How

do

how

<EOS>
"
Pretty

Nothing

<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
the
liberty

sir

"
   
"
Eh

"
 
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
always
lifted
up
his
eyebrows
at
this
point
,
and
became
amiably
distraught
and
smilingly
absent
in
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"

A
few
cigars

sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

<EOS>
(
For
the
moment
,
excessively
surprised

<EOS>
"
Thank

Well

<EOS>
"
Thank

sir

Miss

"
here
Young
John
turned
the
great
hat
round
and
round
upon
his
left

hand
,
like
a
slowly
twirling
mouse

cage
;
<EOS>

Very

He
was
blandly
tapping
his
fingers
on
the
table
,
and
casting
his
eyes
up
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amy

She

to
like

walk
there
better

"
 
<EOS>
He
returned
to
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
father
is
not
on
duty
at
present
,
I
think
,
John
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
he
comes
on
later
in
the
afternoon
.
"
 
<EOS>
Another
twirl
of
the
great
hat
,
and
<EOS>
then
Young
John
said
,
rising
,
"
I
am
afraid
I
must
wish
you
good
day
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
soon
?
 
<EOS>
Good
day
,
Young
John
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
nay
,
"
with
the
utmost
condescension
,
"
never
mind
your
glove
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
Shake
hands
with
it
on
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
no
stranger
here
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
Highly
gratified
by
the
kindness
of
his
reception
,
Young
John
descended
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
way
down
he
met
some
Collegians
bringing
up
visitors
to
be
presented
,
and
at
that
moment
Mr
Dorrit
happened
to
call
over
the
banisters
with
particular
distinctness
,
"
Much
obliged
to
you
for
your
little
testimonial
,
John
!
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
's
lover
very
soon
laid
down
his
penny
on
the
tollplate
of
the
Iron
Bridge
,
and
came
upon
it
looking
about
him
for
the
well
-
known
and
well
-
beloved
figure
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
he
feared
she
was
not
there
;
but
as
he
walked
on
towards
the
Middlesex
side
,
he
saw
her
standing
still
,
looking
at
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
absorbed
in
thought
,
and
he
wondered
what
she
might
be
thinking
about
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
piles
of
city
roofs
and
chimneys
,
more
free
from
smoke
than
on
week
-
days
;
and
there
were
the
distant
masts
and
steeples
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
was
thinking
about
them
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
mused
so
long
,
and
was
so
entirely
preoccupied
,
that
although
her
lover
stood
quiet
for
what
he
thought
was
a
long
time
,
and
twice
or
thrice
retired
and
came
back
again
to
the
former
spot
,
still
she
did
not
move
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
in
the
end
,
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
on
,
and
seem
to
come
upon
her
casually
in
passing
,
and
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
was
quiet
,
and
now
or
never
was
the
time
to
speak
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
He
walked
on
,
and
she
did
not
appear
to
hear
his
steps
until
he
was
close
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
said
"
Miss
Dorrit
!
"
<EOS>
she
started
and
fell
back
from
him
,
with
an
expression
in
her
face
of
fright
and
something
like
dislike
that
caused
him
unutterable
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
often
avoided
him
before
---
always
,
indeed
,
for
a
long
,
long
while
.
<EOS>
She
had
turned
away
and
glided
off
so
often
when
she
had
seen
him
coming
toward
her
,
that
the
unfortunate
Young
John
could
not
think
it
accidental
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
hoped
that
it
might
be
shyness
,
her
retiring
character
,
her
foreknowledge
of
the
state
of
his
heart
,
anything
short
of
aversion
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
that
momentary
look
had
said
,
"
You
,
of
all
people
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
have
seen
any
one
on
earth
than
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
momentary
look
,
inasmuch
as
she
checked
it
,
and
said
in
her
soft
little
voice
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
John
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
she
felt
what
it
had
been
,
as
he
felt
what
it
had
been
;
and
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
equally
confused
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Amy
,
I
am
afraid
I
disturbed
you
by
speaking
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
rather
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
came
here
to
be
alone
,
and
I
thought
I
was
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Amy
,
I
took
the
liberty
of
walking
this
way
,
because
Mr
Dorrit
chanced
to
mention
,
when
I
called
upon
him
just
now
,
that
you
---
"
   
She
caused
him
more
dismay
than
before
by
suddenly
murmuring
,
"
O
father
,
father
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
heartrending
tone
,
and
turning
her
face
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Amy
,
I
hope
I
do
n't
give
you
any
uneasiness
by
naming
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
found
him
very
well
and
in
the
best
of
Spirits
,
and
he
showed
me
even
more
than
his
usual
kindness
;
being
so
very
kind
as
to
say
that
I
was
not
a
stranger
there
,
and
in
all
ways
gratifying
me
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
the
inexpressible
consternation
of
her
lover
,
Little
Dorrit
,
with
her
hands
to
her
averted
face
,
and
rocking
herself
where
she
stood
as
if
she
were
in
pain
,
murmured
,
"
O
father
,
how
can
you
!
 
<EOS>
O
dear
,
dear
father
,
how
can
you
,
can
you
,
do
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
stood
gazing
at
her
,
overflowing
with
sympathy
,
but
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
this
,
until
,
having
taken
out
her
handkerchief
and
put
it
to
her
still
averted
face
,
she
hurried
away
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
he
remained
stock
still
;
then
hurried
after
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Amy
,
pray
!
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
the
goodness
to
stop
a
moment
?
<EOS>
Miss
Amy
,
if
it
comes
to
that
,
let
ME
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
go
out
of
my
senses
,
if
I
have
to
think
that
I
have
driven
you
away
like
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
trembling
voice
and
unfeigned
earnestness
brought
Little
Dorrit
to
a
stop
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
"
she
cried
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
Young
John
,
who
had
never
seen
her
bereft
of
her
quiet
self
-
command
,
who
had
seen
her
from
her
infancy
ever
so
reliable
and
self
-
suppressed
,
there
was
a
shock
in
her
distress
,
and
in
having
to
associate
himself
with
it
as
its
cause
,
that
shook
him
from
his
great
hat
to
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
it
necessary
to
explain
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
be
misunderstood
---
supposed
to
mean
something
,
or
to
have
done
something
,
that
had
never
entered
into
his
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
He
begged
her
to
hear
him
explain
himself
,
as
the
greatest
favour
she
could
show
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Amy
,
I
know
very
well
that
your
family
is
far
above
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
vain
to
conceal
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
Chivery
a
gentleman
that
ever
I
heard
of
,
and
I
will
not
commit
the
meanness
of
making
a
false
representation
on
a
subject
so
momentous
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Amy
,
I
know
very
well
that
your
high
-
souled
brother
,
and
likewise
your
spirited
sister
,
spurn
me
from
a
height
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
to
do
is
to
respect
them
,
to
wish
to
be
admitted
to
their
friendship
,
to
look
up
at
the
eminence
on
which
they
are
placed
from
my
lowlier
station
---
for
,
whether
viewed
as
tobacco
or
viewed
as
the
lock
<EOS>
,
I
well
know
it
is
lowly
---
and
ever
wish
them
well
and
happy
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
really
was
a
genuineness
in
the
poor
fellow
,
and
a
contrast
between
the
hardness
of
his
hat
and
the
softness
of
his
heart
(
albeit
,
perhaps
,
of
his
head
,
too
)
,
that
was
moving
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
entreated
him
to
disparage
neither
himself
nor
his
station
,
and
,
above
all
things
,
to
divest
himself
of
any
idea
that
she
supposed
hers
to
be
superior
.
 
<EOS>
This
gave
him
a
little
comfort
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Amy
,
"
he
then
stammered
,
"
I
have
had
for
a
long
time
 
---
ages
they
seem
to
me
---
Revolving
ages
---
a
heart
-
cherished
wish
to
say
something
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
say
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
involuntarily
started
from
his
side
again
,
with
the
faintest
shadow
of
her
former
look
;
conquering
that
,
she
went
on
at
great
speed
half
across
the
Bridge
without
replying
!
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
---
Miss
Amy
,
I
but
ask
the
question
humbly
---
<EOS>
may
I
say
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
unlucky
already
in
giving
you
pain
without
having
any
such
intentions
,
before
the
holy
Heavens
!
 
<EOS>
that
there
is
no
fear
of
my
saying
it
unless
I
have
your
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
be
miserable
alone
<EOS>
,
I
can
be
cut
up
by
myself
,
why
should
I
also
make
miserable
and
cut
up
one
that
I
would
fling
myself
off
that
parapet
to
give
half
a
moment
's
joy
to
!
 
<EOS>
Not
that
that
's
much
to
do
,
for
I
'd
do
it
for
twopence
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
mournfulness
of
his
spirits
,
and
the
gorgeousness
of
his
appearance
,
might
have
made
him
ridiculous
,
but
that
his
delicacy
made
him
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
learnt
from
it
what
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
John
Chivery
,
"
she
returned
,
trembling
,
but
in
a
quiet
way
,
"
since
you
are
so
considerate
as
to
ask
me
whether
you
shall
say
any
more
---
if
you
please
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
,
Miss
Amy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
if
you
please
.
 
Never
.
"
   
"
O
Lord
!
"
gasped
Young
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
you
will
let
me
,
instead
,
say
something
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
say
it
earnestly
,
and
with
as
plain
a
meaning
as
it
is
possible
to
express
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
think
of
us
,
John
---
I
mean
my
brother
,
and
sister
,
and
me
---
do
n't
think
of
us
as
being
any
different
from
the
rest
;
for
,
whatever
we
once
were
(
which
I
hardly
know
)
<EOS>
we
ceased
to
be
long
ago
,
and
never
can
be
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
much
better
for
you
,
and
much
better
for
others
,
if
you
will
do
that
instead
of
what
you
are
doing
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
Young
John
dolefully
protested
that
he
would
try
to
bear
it
in
mind
,
and
would
be
heartily
glad
to
do
anything
she
wished
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
me
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
think
as
little
of
me
as
you
can
;
the
less
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
think
of
me
at
all
,
John
,
let
it
only
be
as
the
child
you
have
seen
grow
up
in
the
prison
with
one
set
of
duties
always
occupying
her
;
as
a
weak
,
retired
,
contented
,
unprotected
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
particularly
want
you
to
remember
,
that
when
I
come
outside
the
gate
,
I
am
unprotected
and
solitary
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
would
try
to
do
anything
she
wished
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
did
Miss
Amy
so
much
want
him
to
remember
that
?
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
returned
Little
Dorrit
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
I
can
then
quite
trust
you
not
to
forget
to
-
day
,
and
not
to
say
any
more
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
so
generous
that
I
know
I
can
trust
to
you
for
that
;
and
I
do
<EOS>
and
I
always
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
show
you
,
at
once
,
that
I
fully
trust
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
this
place
where
we
are
speaking
better
than
any
place
I
know
;
"
her
slight
colour
had
faded
,
but
her
lover
thought
he
saw
it
coming
back
just
then
;
"
and
I
may
be
often
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
only
necessary
for
me
to
tell
you
so
,
to
be
quite
sure
that
you
will
never
come
here
again
in
search
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
---
quite
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
might
rely
upon
it
,
said
Young
John
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
miserable
wretch
,
but
her
word
was
more
than
a
law
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
good
-
bye
,
John
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
hope
you
will
have
a
good
wife
one
day
,
and
be
a
happy
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
deserve
to
be
happy
,
and
you
will
be
,
John
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
these
words
,
the
heart
that
was
under
the
waistcoat
of
sprigs
---
<EOS>
mere
slop
-
work
,
if
the
truth
must
be
known
---
swelled
to
the
size
of
the
heart
of
a
gentleman
;
and
the
poor
common
little
fellow
,
having
no
room
to
hold
it
,
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
cry
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
piteously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
do
n't
!
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Miss
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
so
he
left
her
:
<EOS>
first
observing
that
she
sat
down
on
the
corner
of
a
seat
,
and
not
only
rested
her
little
hand
upon
the
rough
wall
,
but
laid
her
face
against
it
too
,
as
if
her
head
were
heavy
,
and
her
mind
were
sad
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
affecting
illustration
of
the
fallacy
of
human
projects
,
to
behold
her
lover
,
with
the
great
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
,
the
velvet
collar
turned
up
as
if
it
rained
,
the
plum
-
coloured
coat
buttoned
to
conceal
the
silken
waistcoat
of
golden
sprigs
,
and
the
little
direction
-
post
pointing
inexorably
home
,
creeping
along
by
the
worst
back
-
streets
,
and
composing
,
as
he
went
,
the
following
new
inscription
for
a
tombstone
in
St
George
's
Churchyard
:
   
<EOS>
"
Here
lie
<EOS>
the
mortal
remains

about

one
thousand
eight
hundred

twenty

six
,
Of
a
broken
heart
,
Requesting
with
his
last
breath
that
the
word
AMY
might
be
inscribed
over
his
ashes

which
was
accordingly
directed
to
be
done

By
his
afflicted

The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
in
two
or
three
Relations
 
<EOS>
The
brothers
William
and
Frederick
Dorrit
,
walking
up
and
down
the
College
-
yard
---
of
course
on
the
aristocratic
or
Pump
side
,
for
the
Father
made
it
a
point
of
his
state
to
be
chary
of
going
among
his
children
on
the
Poor
side
,
except
on
Sunday
mornings
,
Christmas
Days
,
and
other
occasions
of
ceremony
,
in
the
observance
whereof
he
was
very
punctual
,
and
at
which
times
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
heads
of
their
infants
,
and
blessed
those
young
insolvents
with
a
benignity
that
was
highly
edifying
---
the
brothers
,
walking
up
and
down
the
College
-
yard
together
,
were
a
memorable
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Frederick
the
free
,
was
so
humbled
,
bowed
,
withered
,
and
faded
<EOS>
;
William
the
bond
,
was
so
courtly
,
condescending
,
and
benevolently
conscious
of
a
position
;
that
in
this
regard
only
,
if
in
no
other
,
the
brothers
were
a
spectacle
to
wonder
at
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
up
and
down
the
yard
on
the
evening
of
Little
Dorrit
's
Sunday
interview
with
her
lover
on
the
Iron
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
The
cares
of
state
were
over
for
that
day
,
the
Drawing
Room
had
been
well
attended
,
several
new
presentations
had
taken
place
,
the
three
-
and
-
sixpence
accidentally
left
on
the
table
had
accidentally
increased
to
twelve
shillings
,
and
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
refreshed
himself
with
a
whiff
of
cigar
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
walked
up
and
down
,
affably
accommodating
his
step
to
the
shuffle
of
his
brother
,
not
proud
in
his
superiority
,
but
considerate
of
that
poor
creature
,
bearing
with
him
,
and
breathing
toleration
of
his
infirmities
in
every
little
puff
of
smoke
that
issued
from
his
lips
and
aspired
to
get
over
the
spiked
wall
,
he
was
a
sight
to
wonder
at
.
   
<EOS>
His
brother
Frederick
of
the
dim
eye
,
palsied
hand
,
bent
form
,
and
groping
mind
,
submissively
shuffled
at
his
side
,
accepting
his
patronage
as
he
accepted
every
incident
of
the
labyrinthian
world
in
which
he
had
got
lost
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
the
usual
screwed
bit
of
whitey
-
brown
paper
in
his
hand
,
from
which
he
ever
and
again
unscrewed
a
spare
pinch
of
snuff
.
 
<EOS>
That
falteringly
taken
,
he
would
glance
at
his
brother
not
unadmiringly
,
put
his
hands
behind
him
,
and
shuffle
on
<EOS>
so
at
his
side
until
he
took
another
pinch
,
or
stood
still
to
look
about
him
---
perchance
suddenly
missing
his
clarionet
.
<EOS>
The
College
visitors
were
melting
away
as
the
shades
of
night
drew
on
,
but
the
yard
was
still
pretty
full
,
the
Collegians
being
mostly
out
,
seeing
their
friends
to
the
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
brothers
paced
the
yard
,
William
the
bond
looked
about
him
to
receive
salutes
,
returned
them
by
graciously
lifting
off
his
hat
,
and
,
with
an
engaging
air
,
prevented
Frederick
the
free
from
running
against
the
company
,
or
being
jostled
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
The
Collegians
as
a
body
were
not
easily
impressible
,
but
even
they
,
according
to
their
various
ways
of
wondering
,
appeared
to
find
in
the
two
brothers
a
sight
to
wonder
at
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
little
low
this
evening
,
Frederick
,
"
said
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
matter
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
stared
for
a
moment
,
and
then
dropped
his
head
and
eyes
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
William
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
is
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
be
persuaded
to
smarten
yourself
up
a
little
,
Frederick
---
"
   
"
Aye
,
aye
!
"
said
the
old
man
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
talk
so
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
glanced
at
a
passing
Collegian
with
whom
he
was
on
friendly
terms
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
An
enfeebled
old
man
,
this
;
but
he
is
my
brother
,
sir
,
my
brother
,
and
the
voice
of
Nature
is
potent
!
"
and
steered
his
brother
clear
of
the
handle
of
the
pump
by
the
threadbare
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
would
have
been
wanting
to
the
perfection
of
his
character
as
a
fraternal
guide
,
philosopher
and
friend
,
if
he
had
only
steered
his
brother
clear
of
ruin
,
instead
of
bringing
it
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
William
,
"
said
the
object
of
his
affectionate
consideration
,
"
that
I
am
tired
,
and
will
go
home
to
bed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Frederick
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
do
n't
let
me
detain
you
;
do
n't
sacrifice
your
inclination
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Late
hours
,
and
a
heated
atmosphere
,
and
years
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Frederick
,
"
weaken
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Frederick
,
"
returned
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
you
are
sufficiently
careful
of
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
your
habits
are
as
precise
and
methodical
<EOS>
as
---
shall
I
say
as
mine
are
?
<EOS>
Not
to
revert
again
to
that
little
eccentricity
which
I
mentioned
just
now
,
I
doubt
if
you
take
air
and
exercise
enough
,
Frederick
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
parade
,
always
at
your
service
.
 
<EOS>
Why
not
use
it
more
regularly
than
you
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
sighed
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
of
no
use
saying
yes
,
yes
,
my
dear
Frederick
,
"
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
in
his
mild
wisdom
persisted
,
"
unless
you
act
on
that
assent
.
 
<EOS>
Consider
my
case
,
Frederick
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
kind
of
example
.
 
<EOS>
Necessity
and
time
have
taught
me
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
At
certain
stated
hours
of
the
day
,
you
will
find
me
on
the
parade
,
in
my
room
,
in
the
Lodge
,
reading
the
paper
,
receiving
company
,
eating
and
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
impressed
upon
Amy
during
many
years
,
<EOS>
that
I
must
have
my
meals
(
for
instance
)
punctually
.
 
<EOS>
Amy
has
grown
up
in
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
these
arrangements
,
and
you
know
what
a
good
girl
she
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
brother
only
sighed
again
,
as
he
plodded
dreamily
along
,
"
Hah
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
said
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
mildly
rallying
him
---
mildly
,
because
of
his
weakness
,
poor
dear
soul
;
"
you
said
that
before
,
and
it
does
not
express
much
,
Frederick
,
even
if
it
means
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
rouse
you
,
my
good
Frederick
;
you
want
to
be
roused
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
William
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
"
returned
the
other
,
lifting
his
dim
eyes
to
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
like
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
said
,
with
a
shrug
of
modest
self
-
depreciation
,
"
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
might
be
like
me
,
my
dear
Frederick
;
you
might
be
,
if
you
chose
!
"
and
forbore
,
in
the
magnanimity
of
his
strength
,
to
press
his
fallen
brother
further
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
deal
of
leave
-
taking
going
on
in
corners
,
as
was
usual
on
Sunday
nights
;
and
here
and
there
in
the
dark
,
some
poor
woman
,
wife
or
mother
,
was
weeping
with
a
new
Collegian
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
had
been
when
the
Father
himself
had
wept
,
in
the
shades
of
that
yard
,
as
his
own
poor
wife
had
wept
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
many
years
ago
;
and
now
he
was
like
a
passenger
aboard
ship
in
a
long
voyage
,
who
has
recovered
from
sea
-
sickness
,
and
is
impatient
of
that
weakness
in
the
fresher
passengers
taken
aboard
at
the
last
port
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
inclined
to
remonstrate
,
and
to
express
his
opinion
that
people
who
could
n't
get
on
without
crying
,
had
no
business
there
.
 
<EOS>
In
manner
,
if
not
in
words
,
he
always
testified
his
displeasure
at
these
interruptions
of
the
general
harmony
;
and
it
was
so
well
understood
,
that
delinquents
usually
withdrew
if
they
were
aware
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
On
this
Sunday
evening
,
he
accompanied
his
brother
to
the
gate
with
an
air
of
endurance
and
clemency
;
being
in
a
bland
temper
and
graciously
disposed
to
overlook
the
tears
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
flaring
gaslight
of
the
Lodge
,
several
Collegians
were
basking
;
some
taking
leave
of
visitors
,
and
some
who
had
no
visitors
,
watching
the
frequent
turning
of
the
key
,
and
conversing
with
one
another
and
with
Mr
Chivery
.
 
<EOS>
The
paternal
entrance
made
a
sensation
of
course
;
and
Mr
Chivery
,
touching
his
hat
(
in
a
short
manner
though
)
with
his
key
,
hoped
he
found
himself
tolerable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Chivery
,
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chivery
said
in
a
low
growl
,
"
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
he
was
all
right
.
"
 
<EOS>
Which
was
his
general
way
of
acknowledging
inquiries
after
his
health
when
a
little
sullen
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
visit
from
Young
John
to
-
day
,
Chivery
.
 
<EOS>
And
very
smart
he
looked
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
Mr
Chivery
had
heard
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chivery
must
confess
,
however
,
that
his
wish
was
that
the
boy
did
n't
lay
out
so
much
money
upon
it
.
<EOS>
For
what
did
it
bring
him
in
?
 
<EOS>
It
only
brought
him
in
wexation
.
<EOS>
And
he
could
get
that
anywhere
for
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
vexation
,
Chivery
?
"
asked
the
benignant
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
odds
,
"
returned
Mr
Chivery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Frederick
going
out
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Chivery
,
my
brother
is
going
home
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
tired
,
and
not
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
,
Frederick
,
take
care
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
my
dear
Frederick
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Shaking
hands
with
his
brother
,
and
touching
his
greasy
hat
to
the
company
in
the
Lodge
,
Frederick
slowly
shuffled
out
of
the
door
which
Mr
Chivery
unlocked
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
showed
the
amiable
solicitude
of
a
superior
being
that
he
should
come
to
no
harm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
so
kind
as
to
keep
the
door
open
a
moment
,
Chivery
,
that
I
may
see
him
go
along
the
passage
and
down
the
steps
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
,
Frederick
!
 
<EOS>
(
He
is
very
infirm
.
)
<EOS>
Mind
the
steps
!
 
<EOS>
(
He
is
so
very
absent
.
)
<EOS>
Be
careful
how
you
cross
,
Frederick
.
 
<EOS>
(
I
really
do
n't
like
the
notion
of
his
going
wandering
at
large
,
he
is
so
extremely
liable
to
be
run
over
.
)
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
and
with
a
face
expressive
of
many
uneasy
doubts
and
much
anxious
guardianship
,
he
turned
his
regards
upon
the
assembled
company
in
the
Lodge
:
so
plainly
indicating
that
his
brother
was
to
be
pitied
for
not
being
under
lock
and
key
,
that
an
opinion
to
that
effect
went
round
among
the
Collegians
assembled
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
receive
it
with
unqualified
assent
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
said
,
No
,
gentlemen
,
no
;
let
them
not
misunderstand
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
Frederick
was
much
broken
,
no
doubt
,
and
it
might
be
more
comfortable
to
himself
(
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
)
to
know
that
he
was
safe
within
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
it
must
be
remembered
that
to
support
an
existence
there
during
many
years
,
required
a
certain
combination
of
qualities
---
he
did
not
say
high
qualities
,
but
qualities
---
moral
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
had
his
brother
Frederick
that
peculiar
union
of
qualities
?
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
he
was
a
most
excellent
man
,
a
most
gentle
,
tender
,
and
estimable
man
,
with
the
simplicity
of
a
child
;
but
would
he
,
though
unsuited
for
most
other
places
,
do
for
that
place
?
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
he
said
confidently
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
he
said
,
Heaven
forbid
that
Frederick
should
be
there
in
any
other
character
than
in
his
present
voluntary
character
!
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
whoever
came
to
that
College
,
to
remain
there
a
length
of
time
,
must
have
strength
of
character
to
go
through
a
good
deal
and
to
come
out
of
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
Was
his
beloved
brother
Frederick
that
man
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
They
saw
him
,
even
as
it
was
,
crushed
.
 
<EOS>
Misfortune
crushed
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
power
of
recoil
enough
,
not
elasticity
enough
,
to
be
a
long
time
in
such
a
place
,
and
yet
preserve
his
self
-
respect
and
feel
conscious
that
he
was
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Frederick
had
not
(
if
he
might
use
the
expression
)
Power
enough
to
see
in
any
delicate
little
attentions
and
---
and
 
<EOS>
---
Testimonials
that
he
might
under
such
circumstances
receive
,
the
goodness
of
human
nature
,
the
fine
spirit
animating
the
Collegians
as
a
community
,
and
at
the
same
time
no
degradation
to
himself
,
and
no
depreciation
of
his
claims
as
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
God
bless
you
!
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
homily
with
which
he
improved
and
pointed
the
occasion
to
the
company
in
the
Lodge
before
turning
into
the
sallow
yard
again
,
and
going
with
his
own
poor
shabby
dignity
past
the
Collegian
in
the
dressing
-
gown
who
had
no
coat
,
and
past
the
Collegian
in
the
sea
-
side
slippers
who
had
no
shoes
,
and
past
the
stout
greengrocer
Collegian
in
the
corduroy
knee
-
breeches
who
had
no
cares
,
and
past
the
lean
clerk
Collegian
in
buttonless
black
who
had
no
hopes
,
up
his
own
poor
shabby
staircase
to
his
own
poor
shabby
room
.
   
<EOS>
There
,
the
table
was
laid
for
his
supper
,
and
his
old
grey
gown
was
ready
for
him
on
his
chair
-
back
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
His
daughter
put
her
little
prayer
-
book
in
her
pocket
---
had
she
been
praying
for
pity
on
all
prisoners
and
captives
!
<EOS>
---
and
rose
to
welcome
him
.
   
<EOS>
Uncle
had
gone
home
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
she
asked
@
as
she
changed
his
coat
and
gave
him
his
black
velvet
cap
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
uncle
had
gone
home
.
 
<EOS>
Had
her
father
enjoyed
his
walk
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
not
much
,
Amy
;
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
Did
he
not
feel
quite
well
?
   
<EOS>
As
she
stood
behind
him
,
leaning
over
his
chair
so
lovingly
,
he
looked
with
downcast
eyes
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
An
uneasiness
stole
over
him
that
was
like
a
touch
of
shame
;
and
when
he
spoke
,
as
he
presently
did
,
it
was
in
an
unconnected
and
embarrassed
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Something
,
I
---
hem
!
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
know
what
,
has
gone
wrong
with
Chivery
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
---
ha
!
---
not
nearly
so
obliging
and
attentive
as
usual
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
---
hem
!
<EOS>
---
it
's
a
little
thing
,
but
it
puts
me
out
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
impossible
to
forget
,
"
turning
his
hands
over
and
over
and
looking
closely
at
them
,
"
that
---
hem
!
---
<EOS>
that
in
such
a
life
as
mine
,
I
am
unfortunately
dependent
on
these
men
for
something
every
hour
in
the
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
arm
was
on
his
shoulder
,
but
she
did
not
look
in
his
face
while
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
Bending
her
head
she
looked
another
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
hem
!
<EOS>
---
I
ca
n't
think
,
Amy
,
what
has
given
Chivery
offence
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
generally
so
---
so
very
attentive
and
respectful
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
-
night
he
was
quite
---
quite
short
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Other
people
there
too
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
good
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
if
I
was
to
lose
the
support
and
recognition
of
Chivery
and
his
brother
officers
,
I
might
starve
to
death
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
he
spoke
,
he
was
opening
and
shutting
his
hands
like
valves
;
so
conscious
all
the
time
of
that
touch
of
shame
,
that
he
shrunk
before
his
own
knowledge
of
his
meaning
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
ha
!
<EOS>
---
I
ca
n't
think
what
it
's
owing
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
can
not
imagine
what
the
cause
of
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
Jackson
here
once
,
a
turnkey
of
the
name
of
Jackson
<EOS>
(
I
do
n't
think
you
can
remember
him
,
my
dear
,
you
were
very
young
)
,
and
---
hem
!
<EOS>
---
and
he
had
a
---
brother
,
and
this
---
young
brother
paid
his
addresses
to
---
<EOS>
at
least
,
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
pay
his
addresses
to
---
but
admired
---
respectfully
admired
---
the
---
not
daughter
,
the
sister
---
of
one
of
us
;
a
rather
distinguished
Collegian
;
I
may
say
,
very
much
so
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
was
Captain
Martin
;
and
he
consulted
me
on
the
question
whether
It
was
necessary
that
his
daughter
---
sister
---
should
hazard
offending
the
turnkey
brother
by
being
too
---
ha
!
---
too
plain
with
the
other
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Captain
Martin
was
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honour
,
and
I
put
it
to
him
first
to
give
me
his
---
his
own
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Captain
Martin
(
highly
respected
in
the
army
)
then
unhesitatingly
said
that
it
appeared
to
him
that
his
---
hem
!
<EOS>
---
sister
was
not
called
upon
to
understand
the
young
man
too
distinctly
,
and
that
she
might
lead
him
on
---
I
am
doubtful
whether
"
lead
him
on
"
was
Captain
Martin
's
exact
expression
:
indeed
I
think
he
said
tolerate
him
---
on
her
father
's
---
I
should
say
,
brother
's
---
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
I
have
strayed
into
this
story
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
has
been
through
being
unable
to
account
for
Chivery
;
but
as
to
the
connection
between
the
two
,
I
do
n't
see
---
"
   
<EOS>
His
voice
died
away
,
as
if
she
could
not
bear
the
pain
of
hearing
him
,
and
her
hand
had
gradually
crept
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
little
while
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
stillness
;
and
he
remained
shrunk
in
his
chair
,
and
<EOS>
she
remained
with
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
her
head
bowed
down
upon
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
His
supper
was
cooking
in
a
saucepan
on
the
fire
,
and
,
when
she
moved
,
it
was
to
make
it
ready
for
him
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
his
usual
seat
,
she
took
hers
,
and
he
began
his
meal
.
 
<EOS>
They
did
not
,
as
yet
,
look
at
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
By
little
and
little
he
began
;
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
with
a
noise
,
taking
things
up
sharply
,
biting
at
his
bread
as
if
he
were
offended
with
it
,
and
in
other
similar
ways
showing
that
he
was
out
of
sorts
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
pushed
his
plate
from
him
,
and
spoke
aloud
;
with
the
strangest
inconsistency
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
matter
whether
I
eat
or
starve
?
 
<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
whether
such
a
blighted
life
as
mine
comes
to
an
end
,
now
,
next
week
,
or
next
year
?
 
<EOS>
What
am
I
worth
to
anyone
?
 
<EOS>
A
poor
prisoner
,
fed
on
alms
and
broken
victuals
;
a
squalid
,
disgraced
wretch
!

<EOS>
"
Father
,
father

"
<EOS>
As
he
rose
she
went
on
her
knees
to
him
,
and
held
up
her
hands
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
"
he
went
on
in
a
suppressed
voice
,
trembling
violently
,
and
looking
at
her
as
wildly
as
if
he
had
gone
mad
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
if
you
could
see
me
as
your
mother
saw
me
,
you
would
n't
believe
it
to
be
the
creature
you
have
only
looked
at
through
the
bars
of
this
cage
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
young
<EOS>
,
I
was
accomplished
,
I
was
good
-
looking
,
I
was
independent
---
by
God
<EOS>
I
was
,
child
!
<EOS>

<EOS>
and
people
sought
me
out
,
and
envied
me

<EOS>
Envied
me
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
father
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
tried
to
take
down
the
shaking
arm
that
he
flourished
in
the
air
,
but
he
resisted
,
and
put
her
hand
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
but
a
picture
of
myself
in
those
days
,
though
it
was
ever
so
ill
done

you
would
be
proud
of
it

you
would
be
proud

it

But
I
have
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
be
a
warning
!
 
<EOS>
Let
no
man
,

he
cried
,
looking
haggardly
about
,
"
fail
to
preserve
at
least
that
little
of
the
times
of
his
prosperity
and
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Let
his
children
have
that
clue
to
what
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
Unless
my
face
,
when
I
am
dead
,
subsides
into
the
long
departed
look

they
say
such
things
happen

I

O

Look
away
from

<EOS>
even
you

<EOS>
Do

I
do
it
to
myself

<EOS>
I
am
hardened
now

low

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
father
,
loved
father
,
darling
of
my
heart

"
 
<EOS>
She
was
clinging
to
him
with
her
arms
,
and
she
got
him
to
drop
into
his
chair
again
,
and
caught
at
the
raised
arm
,
and
tried
to
put
it
round
her
neck
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
it
lie
there

<EOS>
Look
at

me

father

<EOS>
Only
think
of
me
,
father
,
for
one
little
moment
!
"
   
<EOS>
Still
he
went
on
in
the
same
wild
way
,
though
it
was
gradually
breaking
down
into
a
miserable
whining
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
have
some
respect
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
some
stand
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
quite
trodden
down
.
 
<EOS>
Go
out
and
ask
who
is
the
chief
person
in
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
tell
you
it
's
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
Go
out
and
ask
who
is
never
trifled
with
,
and
who
is
always
treated
with
some
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
say
,
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
Go
out
and
ask
what
funeral
here
(
it
must
be
here
<EOS>
,
I
know
it
can
be
nowhere
else
)
will
make
more
talk
,
and
perhaps
more
grief
,
than
any
that
has
ever
gone
out
at
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
say
your
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
Well
then
.
 
<EOS>
Amy
!
<EOS>
Amy
!
 
<EOS>
Is
your
father
so
universally
despised
?
 
<EOS>
Is
there
nothing
to
redeem
him
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
nothing
to
remember
him
by
but
his
ruin
and
decay
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
be
able
to
have
no
affection
for
him
when
he
is
gone
,
poor
castaway
,
gone
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
burst
into
tears
of
maudlin
pity
for
himself
,
and
at
length
suffering
her
to
embrace
him
and
take
charge
of
him
,
let
his
grey
head
rest
against
her
cheek
,
and
bewailed
his
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
changed
the
subject
of
his
lamentations
,
and
clasping
his
hands
about
her
as
she
embraced
him
,
cried
,
O
Amy
,
his
motherless
,
forlorn
child
!
 
<EOS>
O
the
days
that
he
had
seen
her
careful
and
laborious
for
him
!
 
<EOS>
Then
he
reverted
to
himself
,
and
weakly
told
her
how
much
better
she
would
have
loved
him
if
she
had
known
him
in
his
vanished
character
,
and
how
he
would
have
married
her
to
a
gentleman
who
should
have
been
proud
of
her
as
his
daughter
,
and
how
(
at
which
he
cried
again
)
<EOS>
she
should
first
have
ridden
at
his
fatherly
side
on
her
own
horse
,
and
how
the
crowd
(
by
which
he
meant
in
effect
the
people
who
had
given
him
the
twelve
shillings
he
then
had
in
his
pocket
)
should
have
trudged
the
dusty
roads
respectfully
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
now
boasting
,
now
despairing
,
in
either
fit
a
captive
with
the
jail
-
rot
upon
him
,
and
the
impurity
of
his
prison
worn
into
the
grain
of
his
soul
,
he
revealed
his
degenerate
state
to
his
affectionate
child
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
else
ever
beheld
him
in
the
details
of
his
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
Little
recked
the
Collegians
who
were
laughing
in
their
rooms
over
his
late
address
in
the
Lodge
,
what
a
serious
picture
they
had
in
their
obscure
gallery
of
the
Marshalsea
that
Sunday
night
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
classical
daughter
once
---
perhaps
---
who
ministered
to
her
father
in
his
prison
as
her
mother
had
ministered
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
though
of
the
unheroic
modern
stock
and
mere
English
,
did
much
more
,
in
comforting
her
father
's
wasted
heart
upon
her
innocent
breast
,
and
turning
to
it
a
fountain
of
love
and
fidelity
that
never
ran
dry
or
waned
through
all
his
years
of
famine
.
   
<EOS>
She
soothed
him
;
asked
him
for
his
forgiveness
if
she
had
been
,
or
seemed
to
have
been
,
undutiful
;
told
him
,
Heaven
knows
truly
,
that
she
could
not
honour
him
more
if
he
were
the
favourite
of
Fortune
and
the
whole
world
acknowledged
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
his
tears
were
dried
,
and
he
sobbed
in
his
weakness
no
longer
,
and
was
free
from
that
touch
of
shame
,
and
had
recovered
his
usual
bearing
,
she
prepared
the
remains
of
his
supper
afresh
,
and
,
sitting
by
his
side
,
rejoiced
to
see
him
eat
and
drink
.
 
<EOS>
For
now
he
sat
in
his
black
velvet
cap
and
old
grey
gown
,
magnanimous
again
;
and
would
have
comported
himself
towards
any
Collegian
who
might
have
looked
in
to
ask
his
advice
,
like
a
great
moral
Lord
Chesterfield
,
or
Master
of
the
ethical
ceremonies
of
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
To
keep
his
attention
engaged
,
she
talked
with
him
about
his
wardrobe
;
when
he
was
pleased
to
say
,
that
Yes
,
indeed
,
those
shirts
she
proposed
would
be
exceedingly
acceptable
,
for
those
he
had
were
worn
out
,
and
,
being
ready
-
made
,
had
never
fitted
him
.
<EOS>
Being
conversational
,
and
in
a
reasonable
flow
of
spirits
,
he
then
invited
her
attention
to
his
coat
as
it
hung
behind
the
door
:
remarking
that
the
Father
of
the
place
would
set
an
indifferent
example
to
his
children
,
already
disposed
to
be
slovenly
,
if
he
went
among
them
out
at
elbows
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
jocular
,
too
,
as
to
the
heeling
of
his
shoes
;
but
became
grave
on
the
subject
of
his
cravat
,
and
promised
her
that
,
when
she
could
afford
it
,
she
should
buy
him
a
new
one
.
   
<EOS>
While
he
smoked
out
his
cigar
in
peace
,
she
made
his
bed
,
and
put
the
small
room
in
order
for
his
repose
.
 
<EOS>
Being
weary
then
,
owing
to
the
advanced
hour
and
his
emotions
,
he
came
out
of
his
chair
to
bless
her
and
wish
her
Good
night
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
he
had
never
once
thought
of
HER
dress
,
her
shoes
,
her
need
of
anything
.
 
<EOS>
No
other
person
upon
earth
,
save
herself
,
could
have
been
so
unmindful
of
her
wants
.
   
<EOS>
He
kissed
her
many
times
with
"
Bless
you
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
MY
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
her
gentle
breast
had
been
so
deeply
wounded
by
what
she
had
seen
of
him
that
she
was
unwilling
to
leave
him
alone
,
lest
he
should
lament
and
despair
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Father
,
dear
,
I
am
not
tired
;
let
me
come
back
presently
,
when
you
are
in
bed
,
and
sit
by
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
asked
her
,
with
an
air
of
protection
,
if
she
felt
solitary
?
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
come
back
by
all
means
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
quiet
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
of
me
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
,
giving
her
his
kind
permission
fully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
back
by
all
means
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
dozing
when
she
returned
,
and
she
put
the
low
fire
together
very
softly
lest
she
should
awake
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
overheard
her
,
and
called
out
who
was
that
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
Amy
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
my
child
,
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
say
a
word
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
raised
himself
a
little
in
his
low
bed
,
as
she
kneeled
beside
it
to
bring
her
face
near
him
;
and
put
his
hand
between
hers
.
 
<EOS>
O
!
 
<EOS>
Both
the
private
father
and
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
were
strong
within
him
then
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
you
have
had
a
life
of
hardship
here
.
 
<EOS>
No
companions
,
no
recreations
,
many
cares
I
am
afraid
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
think
of
that
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
position
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
able
to
do
much
for
you
;
but
all
I
have
been
able
to
do
,
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
father
,
"
she
rejoined
,
kissing
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
the
twenty
-
third
year
of
my
life
here
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
catch
in
his
breath
that
was
not
so
much
a
sob
as
an
irrepressible
sound
of
self
-
approval
,
the
momentary
outburst
of
a
noble
consciousness
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
I
could
do
for
my
children
---
I
have
done
it
.
 
<EOS>
Amy
,
my
love
,
you
are
by
far
the
best
loved
of
the
three
;
I
have
had
you
principally
in
my
mind
---
whatever
I
have
done
for
your
sake
,
my
dear
child
,
I
have
done
freely
and
without
murmuring
.
"
   
<EOS>
Only
the
wisdom
that
holds
the
clue
to
all
hearts
and
all
mysteries
,
can
surely
know
to
what
extent
<EOS>
a
man
,
especially
a
man
brought
down
as
this
man
had
been
,
can
impose
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
Enough
,
for
the
present
place
,
that
he
lay
down
with
wet
eyelashes
,
serene
,
in
a
manner
majestic
,
after
bestowing
his
life
of
degradation
as
a
sort
of
portion
on
the
devoted
child
upon
whom
its
miseries
had
fallen
so
heavily
,
and
whose
love
alone
had
saved
him
to
be
even
what
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
That
child
had
no
doubts
,
asked
herself
no
question
,
for
she
was
but
too
content
to
see
him
with
a
lustre
<EOS>
round
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
dear
,
good
dear
,
truest
,
kindest
,
dearest
,
were
the
only
words
she
had
for
him
,
as
she
hushed
him
to
rest
.
   
<EOS>
She
never
left
him
all
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
she
had
done
him
a
wrong
which
her
tenderness
could
hardly
repair
,
she
sat
by
him
in
his
sleep
,
at
times
softly
kissing
him
with
suspended
breath
,
and
calling
him
in
a
whisper
by
some
endearing
name
.
 
<EOS>
At
times
she
stood
aside
so
as
not
to
intercept
the
low
fire
-
light
,
and
,
watching
him
when
it
fell
upon
his
sleeping
face
,
wondered
did
he
look
now
at
all
as
he
had
looked
when
he
was
prosperous
and
happy
;
as
he
had
so
touched
her
by
imagining
that
he
might
look
once
more
in
that
awful
time
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
thought
of
that
time
,
she
kneeled
beside
his
bed
again
,
and
prayed
,
"
O
spare
his
life
!
 
<EOS>
O
save
him
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
O
look
down
upon
my
dear
,
long
-
suffering
,
unfortunate
,
much
-
changed
,
dear
dear
father
!
"
   
<EOS>
Not
until
the
morning
came
to
protect
him
and
encourage
him
,
did
she
give
him
a
last
kiss
and
leave
the
small
room
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
stolen
down
-
stairs
,
and
along
the
empty
yard
,
and
had
crept
up
to
her
own
high
garret
,
<EOS>
the
smokeless
housetops
and
the
distant
country
hills
were
discernible
over
the
wall
in
the
clear
morning
.
<EOS>
As
she
gently
opened
the
window
,
and
looked
eastward
down
the
prison
yard
,
the
spikes
upon
the
wall
were
tipped
with
red
,
then
made
a
sullen
purple
pattern
on
the
sun
as
it
came
flaming
up
into
the
heavens
.
 
<EOS>
The
spikes
had
never
looked
so
sharp
and
cruel
,
nor
the
bars
so
heavy
,
nor
the
prison
space
so
gloomy
and
contracted
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
the
sunrise
on
rolling
rivers
,
of
the
sunrise
on
wide
seas
,
of
the
sunrise
on
rich
landscapes
,
of
the
sunrise
on
great
forests
where
the
birds
were
waking
and
the
trees
were
rustling
;
and
she
looked
down
into
the
living
grave
on
which
the
sun
had
risen
,
with
her
father
in
it
three
-
and
-
twenty
years
,
and
said
,
in
a
burst
of
sorrow
and
compassion
,
"
No
,
no
,
I
have
never
seen
him
in
my
life
!

<EOS>
Moving
in
Society
 
<EOS>
If
Young
John
Chivery
had
had
the
inclination
and
the
power
to
write
a
satire
on
family
pride
,
he
would
have
had
no
need
to
go
for
an
avenging
illustration
out
of
the
family
of
his
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
found
it
amply
in
that
gallant
brother
and
that
dainty
sister
,
so
steeped
in
mean
experiences
,
and
so
loftily
conscious
of
the
family
name
;
so
ready
to
beg
or
borrow
from
the
poorest
,
to
eat
of
anybody
's
bread
,
spend
anybody
's
money
,
drink
from
anybody
's
cup
and
break
it
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
To
have
painted
the
sordid
facts
of
their
lives
,
and
they
throughout
invoking
the
death
's
head
apparition
of
the
family
gentility
to
come
and
scare
their
benefactors
,
would
have
made
Young
John
a
satirist
of
the
first
water
.
   
<EOS>
Tip
had
turned
his
liberty
to
hopeful
account
by
becoming
a
billiard
-
marker
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
troubled
himself
so
little
as
to
the
means
of
his
release
,
that
Clennam
scarcely
needed
to
have
been
at
the
pains
of
impressing
the
mind
of
Mr
Plornish
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
Whoever
had
paid
him
the
compliment
,
he
very
readily
accepted
the
compliment
with
HIS
compliments
,
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
Issuing
forth
from
the
gate
on
these
easy
terms
,
he
became
a
billiard
-
marker
;
and
now
occasionally
looked
in
at
the
little
skittle
-
ground
in
a
green
Newmarket
coat
(
second
-
hand
)
,
with
a
shining
collar
and
bright
buttons
(
new
)
,
and
drank
the
beer
of
the
Collegians
.
   
<EOS>
One
solid
stationary
point
in
the
looseness
of
this
gentleman
's
character
was
,
that
he
respected
and
admired
his
sister
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
The
feeling
had
never
induced
him
to
spare
her
a
moment
's
uneasiness
,
or
to
put
himself
to
any
restraint
or
inconvenience
on
her
account
;
but
with
that
Marshalsea
taint
upon
his
love
,
he
loved
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
rank
Marshalsea
flavour
was
to
be
recognised
in
his
distinctly
perceiving
that
she
sacrificed
her
life
to
her
father
,
and
in
his
having
no
idea
that
she
had
done
anything
for
himself
.
   
<EOS>
When
this
spirited
young
man
and
his
sister
had
begun
systematically
to
produce
the
family
skeleton
for
the
overawing
of
the
College
,
this
narrative
can
not
precisely
state
.
 
<EOS>
Probably
at
about
the
period
when
they
began
to
dine
on
the
College
charity
.
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
the
more
reduced
and
necessitous
they
were
,
the
more
pompously
the
skeleton
emerged
from
its
tomb
;
and
that
when
there
was
anything
particularly
shabby
in
the
wind
,
the
skeleton
always
came
out
with
the
ghastliest
flourish
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
late
on
the
Monday
morning
,
for
her
father
slept
late
,
and
afterwards
there
was
his
breakfast
to
prepare
and
his
room
to
arrange
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
engagement
to
go
out
to
work
,
however
,
and
therefore
stayed
with
him
until
,
with
Maggy
's
help
,
she
had
put
everything
right
about
him
,
and
had
seen
him
off
upon
his
morning
walk
(
of
twenty
yards
or
so
)
to
the
coffee
-
house
to
read
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
She
then
got
on
her
bonnet
and
went
out
,
having
been
anxious
to
get
out
much
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
,
as
usual
,
a
cessation
of
the
small
-
talk
in
the
Lodge
as
she
passed
through
it
;
and
a
Collegian
who
had
come
in
on
Saturday
night
,
received
the
intimation
from
the
elbow
of
a
more
seasoned
Collegian
,
"
Look
out
.
 
<EOS>
Here
she
is
!
"
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
see
her
sister
,
but
when
she
got
round
to
Mr
Cripples
's
,
she
found
that
both
her
sister
and
her
uncle
had
gone
to
the
theatre
where
they
were
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
Having
taken
thought
of
this
probability
by
the
way
,
and
having
settled
that
in
such
case
she
would
follow
them
,
she
set
off
afresh
for
the
theatre
,
which
was
on
that
side
of
the
river
,
and
not
very
far
away
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
almost
as
ignorant
of
the
ways
of
theatres
as
of
the
ways
of
gold
mines
,
and
when
she
was
directed
to
a
furtive
sort
of
door
,
with
a
curious
up
-
all
-
night
air
about
it
,
that
appeared
to
be
ashamed
of
itself
and
to
be
hiding
in
an
alley
,
she
hesitated
to
approach
it
;
being
further
deterred
by
the
sight
of
some
half
-
dozen
close
-
shaved
gentlemen
with
their
hats
very
strangely
on
,
who
were
lounging
about
the
door
,
looking
not
at
all
unlike
Collegians
.
 
<EOS>
On
her
applying
to
them
,
reassured
by
this
resemblance
,
for
a
direction
to
Miss
Dorrit
,
they
made
way
for
her
to
enter
a
dark
hall
---
it
was
more
like
<EOS>
a
great
grim
lamp
gone
out
than
anything
else
---
where
she
could
hear
the
distant
playing
of
music
and
the
sound
of
dancing
feet
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
so
much
in
want
of
airing
that
he
had
a
blue
mould
upon
him
,
sat
watching
this
dark
place
from
a
hole
in
a
corner
,
like
a
spider
;
and
he
told
her
that
he
would
send
a
message
up
to
Miss
Dorrit
by
the
first
lady
or
gentleman
who
went
through
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
lady
who
went
through
had
a
roll
of
music
,
half
in
her
muff
and
half
out
of
it
,
and
was
in
such
a
tumbled
condition
altogether
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
be
an
act
of
kindness
to
iron
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
she
was
very
good
-
natured
,
and
said
,
"
Come
with
me
;
I
'll
soon
find
Miss
Dorrit
for
you
,
"
Miss
Dorrit
's
sister
went
with
her
,
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
at
every
step
she
took
in
the
darkness
to
the
sound
of
music
and
the
sound
of
dancing
feet
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
they
came
into
a
maze
of
dust
,
where
a
quantity
of
people
were
tumbling
over
one
another
,
and
where
there
was
such
a
confusion
of
unaccountable
shapes
of
beams
,
bulkheads
,
brick
walls
,
ropes
,
and
rollers
,
and
such
a
mixing
of
gaslight
and
daylight
,
that
they
seemed
to
have
got
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
pattern
of
the
universe
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
left
to
herself
,
and
knocked
against
by
somebody
every
moment
,
was
quite
bewildered
,
when
she
heard
her
sister
's
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
good
gracious
,
Amy
,
what
ever
brought
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
to
see
you
,
Fanny
dear
;
and
as
I
am
going
out
all
day
to
-
morrow
,
and
knew
you
might
be
engaged
all
day
to
-
day
<EOS>
,
I
thought
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
But
the
idea
,
Amy
,
of
YOU
coming
behind
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
did
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
her
sister
said
this
in
no
very
cordial
tone
of
welcome
,
she
conducted
her
to
a
more
open
part
of
the
maze
,
where
various
golden
chairs
and
tables
were
heaped
together
,
and
where
a
number
of
young
ladies
were
sitting
on
anything
they
could
find
,
chattering
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
young
ladies
wanted
ironing
,
and
all
had
a
curious
way
of
looking
everywhere
while
they
chattered
.
   
<EOS>
just
as
the
sisters
arrived
here
,
a
monotonous
boy
in
a
Scotch
cap
put
his
head
round
a
beam
on
the
left
,
and
said
,
"
Less
noise
there
,
ladies
!
"
and
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
after
which
,
a
sprightly
gentleman
with
a
quantity
of
long
black
hair
looked
round
a
beam
on
the
right
,
and
said
,
"
Less
noise
there
,
darlings
!
"
and
also
disappeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
notion
of
you
among
professionals
,
Amy
,
is
really
the
last
thing
I
could
have
conceived
!
"
said
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
did
you
ever
get
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
who
told
you
I
was
here
,
was
so
good
as
to
bring
me
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Like
you
quiet
little
things
!
 
<EOS>
You
can
make
your
way
anywhere
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
have
managed
it
,
<EOS>
Amy
,
though
I
know
so
much
more
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
family
custom
to
lay
it
down
as
family
law
,
that
she
was
a
plain
domestic
little
creature
,
without
the
great
and
sage
experience
of
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
This
family
fiction
was
the
family
assertion
of
itself
against
her
services
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
make
too
much
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
have
you
got
on
your
mind
,
<EOS>
Amy
?
 
<EOS>
Of
course
you
have
got
something
on
your
mind
about
me
?
"
said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
as
if
her
sister
,
between
two
and
three
years
her
junior
,
were
her
prejudiced
grandmother
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
much
;
but
since
you
told
me
of
the
lady
who
gave
you
the
bracelet
,
Fanny
---
"
   
The
monotonous
boy
put
his
head
round
the
beam
on
the
left
,
and
said
,
"
Look
out
there
,
ladies
!
"
and
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
sprightly
gentleman
with
the
black
hair
as
suddenly
put
his
head
round
the
beam
on
the
right
,
and
said
,
"
Look
out
there
,
darlings
!
"
and
also
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
all
the
young
ladies
rose
and
began
shaking
their
skirts
out
behind
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Amy
?
"
said
Fanny
,
doing
as
the
rest
did
;
"
what
were
you
going
to
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Since
you
told
me
a
lady
had
given
you
the
bracelet
you
showed
me
,
Fanny
,
I
have
not
been
quite
easy
on
your
account
,
and
indeed
want
to
know
a
little
more
if
you
will
confide
more
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
ladies
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
boy
in
the
Scotch
cap
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
darlings
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
gentleman
with
the
black
hair
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
every
one
gone
in
a
moment
,
and
the
music
and
the
dancing
feet
were
heard
again
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
sat
down
in
a
golden
chair
,
made
quite
giddy
by
these
rapid
interruptions
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
and
the
rest
were
a
long
time
gone
;
and
during
their
absence
a
voice
(
it
appeared
to
be
that
of
the
gentleman
with
the
black
hair
)
was
continually
calling
out
through
the
music
,
"
One
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
six
---
go
!
 
<EOS>
One
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
six
---
go
!
 
<EOS>
Steady
,
darlings
!
 
<EOS>
One
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
six
---
go
!
"
 
<EOS>
Ultimately
the
voice
stopped
,
and
they
all
came
back
again
,
more
or
less
out
of
breath
,
folding
themselves
in
their
shawls
,
and
making
ready
for
the
streets
.
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
moment
,
Amy
,
and
let
them
get
away
before
us
,
"
whispered
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
soon
left
alone
;
nothing
more
important
happening
,
in
the
meantime
,
than
the
boy
looking
round
his
old
beam
,
and
saying
,
"
Everybody
at
eleven
to
-
morrow
,
ladies
!
"
and
the
gentleman
with
the
black
hair
looking
round
his
old
beam
,
and
saying
,
"
Everybody
at
eleven
to
-
morrow
,
darlings
!
<EOS>
"
each
in
his
own
accustomed
manner
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
were
alone
,
something
was
rolled
up
or
by
other
means
got
out
of
the
way
,
and
there
was
a
great
empty
well
before
them
,
looking
down
into
the
depths
of
which
Fanny
said
,
"
Now
,
uncle
!
"
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
as
her
eyes
became
used
to
the
darkness
,
faintly
made
him
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
,
in
an
obscure
corner
by
himself
,
with
his
instrument
in
its
ragged
case
under
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
as
if
the
remote
high
gallery
windows
,
with
their
little
strip
of
sky
,
might
have
been
the
point
of
his
better
fortunes
,
from
which
he
had
descended
,
until
he
had
gradually
sunk
down
below
there
to
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
that
place
six
nights
a
week
for
many
years
,
but
had
never
been
observed
to
raise
his
eyes
above
his
music
-
book
,
and
was
confidently
believed
to
have
never
seen
a
play
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
legends
in
the
place
that
he
did
not
so
much
as
know
the
popular
heroes
and
heroines
by
sight
,
and
that
the
low
comedian
had
"
mugged
"
at
him
in
his
richest
manner
fifty
nights
for
a
wager
,
and
he
had
shown
no
trace
of
consciousness
.
<EOS>
The
carpenters
had
a
joke
to
the
effect
that
he
was
dead
without
being
aware
of
it
;
and
the
frequenters
of
the
pit
supposed
him
to
pass
his
whole
life
,
night
and
day
,
and
Sunday
and
all
,
in
the
orchestra
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
tried
him
a
few
times
with
pinches
of
snuff
offered
over
the
rails
,
and
he
had
always
responded
to
this
attention
with
a
momentary
waking
up
of
manner
that
had
the
pale
phantom
of
a
gentleman
in
it
:
beyond
this
he
never
,
on
any
occasion
,
had
any
other
part
in
what
was
going
on
than
the
part
written
out
for
the
clarionet
;
in
private
life
,
where
there
was
no
part
for
the
clarionet
,
he
had
no
part
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Some
said
he
was
poor
,
some
said
he
was
a
wealthy
miser
;
but
he
said
nothing
,
never
lifted
up
his
bowed
head
,
never
varied
his
shuffling
gait
by
getting
his
springless
foot
from
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Though
expecting
now
to
be
summoned
by
his
niece
,
he
did
not
hear
her
until
she
had
spoken
to
him
three
or
four
times
;
nor
was
he
at
all
surprised
by
the
presence
of
two
nieces
instead
of
one
,
but
merely
said
in
his
tremulous
voice
,
"
I
am
coming
,
I
am
coming
!
"
and
crept
forth
by
some
underground
way
which
emitted
a
cellarous
smell
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
Amy
,
"
said
her
sister
,
when
the
three
together
passed
out
at
the
door
that
had
such
a
shame
-
faced
consciousness
of
being
different
from
other
doors
<EOS>
:
the
uncle
instinctively
taking
Amy
's
arm
as
the
arm
to
be
relied
on
:
"
<EOS>
so
,
Amy
,
you
are
curious
about
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
pretty
,
and
conscious
,
and
rather
flaunting
;
and
the
condescension
with
which
she
put
aside
the
superiority
of
her
charms
,
and
of
her
worldly
experience
,
and
addressed
her
sister
on
almost
equal
terms
,
had
a
vast
deal
of
the
family
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
interested
,
Fanny
,
and
concerned
in
anything
that
concerns
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
are
,
so
you
are
,
and
you
are
the
best
of
Amys
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
ever
a
little
provoking
,
I
am
sure
you
'll
consider
what
a
thing
it
is
to
occupy
my
position
and
feel
a
consciousness
of
being
superior
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
care
,
"
said
the
Daughter
of
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
"
if
the
others
were
not
so
common
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
them
have
come
down
in
the
world
as
we
have
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
all
on
their
own
level
.
 
<EOS>
Common
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
mildly
looked
at
the
speaker
,
but
did
not
interrupt
her
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
took
out
her
handkerchief
,
and
rather
angrily
wiped
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
born
where
you
were
,
you
know
,
Amy
,
and
<EOS>
perhaps
that
makes
a
difference
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
when
we
get
rid
of
Uncle
,
you
shall
know
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
drop
him
at
the
cook
's
shop
where
he
is
going
to
dine
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
walked
on
with
him
until
they
came
to
a
dirty
shop
window
in
a
dirty
street
,
which
was
made
almost
opaque
by
the
steam
of
hot
meats
,
vegetables
,
and
puddings
.
 
<EOS>
But
glimpses
were
to
be
caught
of
a
roast
leg
of
pork
bursting
into
tears
of
sage
and
onion
in
a
metal
reservoir
full
of
gravy
,
of
an
unctuous
piece
of
roast
beef
and
blisterous
Yorkshire
pudding
,
bubbling
hot
in
a
similar
receptacle
,
of
a
stuffed
fillet
of
veal
in
rapid
cut
,
of
a
ham
in
a
perspiration
with
the
pace
it
was
going
at
,
of
a
shallow
tank
of
baked
potatoes
glued
together
by
their
own
richness
,
of
a
truss
or
two
of
boiled
greens
,
and
other
substantial
delicacies
.
 
<EOS>
Within
,
were
a
few
wooden
partitions
,
behind
which
such
customers
as
found
it
more
convenient
to
take
away
their
dinners
in
stomachs
than
in
their
hands
,
Packed
their
purchases
in
solitude
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
opening
her
reticule
,
as
they
surveyed
these
things
,
produced
from
that
repository
a
shilling
and
handed
it
to
Uncle
.
 
<EOS>
Uncle
,
after
not
looking
at
it
a
little
while
,
divined
its
object
,
and
muttering
"
Dinner
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
"
slowly
vanished
from
them
into
the
mist
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Amy
,
"
said
her
sister
,
"
come
with
me
,
if
you
are
not
too
tired
to
walk
to
Harley
Street
,
Cavendish
Square
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
air
with
which
she
threw
off
this
distinguished
address
and
the
toss
she
gave
to
her
new
bonnet
(
which
was
more
gauzy
than
serviceable
)
,
made
her
sister
wonder
;
however
,
she
expressed
her
readiness
to
go
to
Harley
Street
,
and
thither
they
directed
their
steps
.
 
<EOS>
Arrived
at
that
grand
destination
,
Fanny
singled
out
the
handsomest
house
,
and
knocking
at
the
door
,
inquired
for
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
The
footman
who
opened
the
door
,
although
he
had
powder
on
his
head
and
was
backed
up
by
two
other
footmen
likewise
powdered
,
not
only
admitted
Mrs
Merdle
to
be
at
home
,
but
asked
Fanny
to
walk
in
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
walked
in
,
taking
her
sister
with
her
;
and
they
went
up
-
stairs
with
powder
going
before
and
powder
stopping
behind
,
and
were
left
in
a
spacious
semicircular
drawing
-
room
,
one
of
several
drawing
-
rooms
,
where
there
was
a
parrot
on
the
outside
of
a
golden
cage
holding
on
by
its
beak
,
with
its
scaly
legs
in
the
air
,
and
putting
itself
into
many
strange
upside
-
down
postures
.
 
<EOS>
This
peculiarity
has
been
observed
in
birds
of
quite
another
feather
,
climbing
upon
golden
wires
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
was
far
more
splendid
than
anything
Little
Dorrit
had
ever
imagined
,
and
would
have
been
splendid
and
costly
in
any
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
in
amazement
at
her
sister
and
would
have
asked
a
question
,
but
that
Fanny
with
a
warning
frown
pointed
to
a
curtained
doorway
of
communication
with
another
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
curtain
shook
next
moment
,
and
a
lady
,
raising
it
with
a
heavily
ringed
hand
,
dropped
it
behind
her
again
as
she
entered
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
was
not
young
and
fresh
from
the
hand
of
Nature
,
but
was
young
and
fresh
from
the
hand
of
her
maid
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
large
unfeeling
handsome
eyes
,
and
dark
unfeeling
handsome
hair
,
and
a
broad
unfeeling
handsome
bosom
,
and
was
made
the
most
of
in
every
particular
.
 
<EOS>
Either
because
she
had
a
cold
,
or
because
it
suited
her
face
,
she
wore
a
rich
white
fillet
tied
over
her
head
and
under
her
chin
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
ever
there
were
an
unfeeling
handsome
chin
that
looked
as
if
,
for
certain
,
it
had
never
been
,
in
familiar
parlance
,
"
chucked
"
by
the
hand
of
man
,
it
was
the
chin
curbed
up
so
tight
and
close
by
that
laced
bridle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
sister
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
your
sister
,
Miss
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
remember
that
you
had
a
sister
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mention
that
I
had
,
"
said
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
curled
the
little
finger
of
her
left
hand
as
who
should
say
,
"
I
have
caught
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
did
n't
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
All
her
action
was
usually
with
her
left
hand
because
her
hands
were
not
a
pair
;
and
left
being
much
the
whiter
and
plumper
of
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
added
:
"
Sit
down
,
"
and
composed
herself
voluptuously
,
in
a
nest
of
crimson
and
gold
cushions
,
on
an
ottoman
near
the
parrot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Also
professional
?
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
looking
at
Little
Dorrit
through
an
eye
-
glass
.
   
<EOS>
Fanny
answered
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
dropping
her
glass
.
<EOS>
"
Has
not
a
professional
air
.
 
<EOS>
Very
pleasant
;
but
not
professional
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
sister
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Fanny
,
in
whom
there
was
a
singular
mixture
of
deference
and
hardihood
,
"
has
been
asking
me
to
tell
her
,
<EOS>
as
between
sisters
,
how
I
came
to
have
the
honour
of
knowing
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
I
had
engaged
to
call
upon
you
once
more
,
I
thought
I
might
take
the
liberty
of
bringing
her
with
me
,
when
perhaps
you
would
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
her
to
know
,
and
perhaps
you
will
tell
her
?
"
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
at
your
sister
's
age
---
"
hinted
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
much
older
than
she
looks
,
"
said
Fanny
;
"
almost
as
old
as
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Society
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
with
another
curve
of
her
little
finger
,
"
is
so
difficult
to
explain
to
young
persons
(
indeed
is
so
difficult
to
explain
to
most
persons
)
,
that
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
Society
was
not
so
arbitrary
<EOS>
,
I
wish
it
was
not
so
exacting

<EOS>
Bird
,
be

<EOS>
The
parrot
had
given
a
most
piercing
shriek
,
as
if
its
name
were
Society
and
it
asserted
its
right
to
its
exactions
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
we
must
take
it
as
we
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
it
is
hollow
and
conventional
and
worldly
and
very
shocking
,
but
unless
we
are
Savages
in
the
Tropical
seas
<EOS>
(
I
should
have
been
charmed
to
be
one
myself
---
most
delightful
life
and
perfect
climate
,
I
am
told
)
,
we
must
consult
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
common
lot
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
is
a
most
extensive
merchant
,
his
transactions
are
on
the
vastest
scale
,
his
wealth
and
influence
are
very
great
,
but
even
he
---
 
Bird
,
be
quiet
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
parrot
had
shrieked
another
shriek
;
and
it
filled
up
the
sentence
so
expressively
that
Mrs
Merdle
was
under
no
necessity
to
end
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Since
your
sister
begs
that
I
would
terminate
our
personal
acquaintance
,
"
she
began
again
,
addressing
Little
Dorrit
,
"
by
relating
the
circumstances
that
are
much
to
her
credit
,
I
can
not
object
to
comply
with
her
request
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
son
(
I
was
first
married
extremely
young
)
of
two
or
three
-
and
-
twenty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fanny
set
her
lips
,
and
her
eyes
looked
half
triumphantly
at
her
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
son
of
two
or
three
-
and
-
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
little
gay
,
a
thing
Society
is
accustomed
to
in
young
men
,
and
he
is
very
impressible
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
inherits
that
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
impressible
myself
,
by
nature
.
 
<EOS>
The
weakest
of
creatures
---
my
feelings
are
touched
in
a
moment
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
all
this
,
and
everything
else
,
as
coldly
as
a
woman
of
snow
;
quite
forgetting
the
sisters
except
at
odd
times
,
and
apparently
addressing
some
abstraction
of
Society
;
for
whose
behoof
,
too
,
she
occasionally
arranged
her
dress
,
or
the
composition
of
her
figure
upon
the
ottoman
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
he
is
very
impressible
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
misfortune
in
our
natural
state
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
but
we
are
not
in
a
natural
state
.
 
<EOS>
Much
to
be
lamented
,
no
doubt
,
particularly
by
myself
,
who
am
a
child
of
nature
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
show
it
;
but
so
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Society
suppresses
us
and
dominates
us
---
 
Bird
,
be
quiet
!
"
<EOS>
The
parrot
had
broken
into
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
,
after
twisting
divers
bars
of
his
cage
with
his
crooked
bill
,
and
licking
them
with
his
black
tongue
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
unnecessary
to
say
to
a
person
of
your
good
sense
,
wide
range
of
experience
,
and
cultivated
feeling
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
from
her
nest
of
crimson
and
gold
---
and
there
put
up
her
glass
to
refresh
her
memory
as
to
whom
she
was
addressing
,
---
"
that
the
stage
sometimes
has
a
fascination
for
young
men
of
that
class
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
In
saying
the
stage
,
I
mean
the
people
on
it
of
the
female
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
when
I
heard
that
my
son
was
supposed
to
be
fascinated
by
a
dancer
,
I
knew
what
that
usually
meant
in
Society
,
and
confided
in
her
being
a
dancer
at
the
Opera
,
where
young
men
moving
in
Society
are
usually
fascinated
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
passed
her
white
hands
over
one
another
,
observant
of
the
sisters
now
;
and
the
rings
upon
her
fingers
grated
against
each
other
with
a
hard
sound
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
your
sister
will
tell
you
,
when
I
found
what
the
theatre
was
<EOS>
I
was
much
surprised
and
much
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
found
that
your
sister
,
by
rejecting
my
son
's
advances
(
I
must
add
,
in
an
unexpected
manner
)
,
had
brought
him
to
the
point
of
proposing
marriage
,
my
feelings
were
of
the
profoundest
anguish
---
acute
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
traced
the
outline
of
her
left
eyebrow
,
and
put
it
right
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
a
distracted
condition
,
which
only
a
mother
---
moving
in
Society
---
can
be
susceptible
of
,
I
determined
to
go
myself
to
the
theatre
,
and
represent
my
state
of
mind
to
the
dancer
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
myself
known
to
your
sister
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
her
,
to
my
surprise
,
in
many
respects
different
from
my
expectations
;
and
certainly
in
none
more
so
,
than
in
meeting
me
with
---
what
shall
I
say
---
a
sort
of
family
assertion
on
her
own
part
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Fanny
,
with
a
heightening
colour
,
"
that
although
you
found
me
in
that
situation
,
I
was
so
far
above
the
rest
,
that
I
considered
my
family
as
good
as
your
son
's
;
and
that
I
had
a
brother
who
,
knowing
the
circumstances
,
would
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
and
would
not
consider
such
a
connection
any
honour
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dorrit
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
after
frostily
looking
at
her
through
her
glass
,
"
precisely
what
I
was
on
the
point
of
telling
your
sister
,
in
pursuance
of
your
request
.
 
<EOS>
Much
obliged
to
you
for
recalling
it
so
accurately
and
anticipating
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
,
"
addressing
Little
Dorrit
,
"
(
for
I
am
the
creature
of
impulse
)
,
took
a
bracelet
from
my
arm
,
and
begged
your
sister
to
let
me
clasp
it
on
hers
,
in
token
of
the
delight
I
had
in
our
being
able
to
approach
the
subject
so
far
on
a
common
footing
.
"
 
<EOS>
(
This
was
perfectly
true
,
the
lady
having
bought
a
cheap
and
showy
article
on
her
way
to
the
interview
,
with
a
general
eye
to
bribery
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
told
you
,
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
that
we
might
be
unfortunate
,
but
we
are
not
common
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
the
very
words
,
Miss
Dorrit
,
"
assented
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
told
you
,
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
that
if
you
spoke
to
me
of
the
superiority
of
your
son
's
standing
in
Society
,
it
was
barely
possible
that
you
rather
deceived
yourself
in
your
suppositions
about
my
origin
;
and
that
my
father
's
standing
,
even
in
the
Society
in
which
he
now
moved
(
what
that
was
,
was
best
known
to
myself
)
,
was
eminently
superior
,
and
was
acknowledged
by
every
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
accurate
,
"
rejoined
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
most
admirable
memory
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
my
sister
the
rest
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
very
little
to
tell
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
reviewing
the
breadth
of
bosom
which
seemed
essential
to
her
having
room
enough
to
be
unfeeling
in
,
"
but
it
is
to
your
sister
's
credit
.
 
<EOS>
I
pointed
out
to
your
sister
the
plain
state
of
the
case
;
the
impossibility
of
the
Society
in
which
we
moved
recognising
the
Society
in
which
she
moved
---
though
charming
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
the
immense
disadvantage
at
which
she
would
consequently
place
the
family
she
had
so
high
an
opinion
of
,
upon
which
we
should
find
ourselves
compelled
to
look
down
with
contempt
,
and
from
which
(
socially
speaking
)
we
should
feel
obliged
to
recoil
with
abhorrence
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
made
an
appeal
to
that
laudable
pride
in
your
sister
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
my
sister
know
,
if
you
please
,
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
Fanny
pouted
,
with
a
toss
of
her
gauzy
bonnet
,
"
that
I
had
already
had
the
honour
of
telling
your
son
that
I
wished
to
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Dorrit
,
"
assented
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
perhaps
I
might
have
mentioned
that
before
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
did
not
think
of
it
,
perhaps
it
was
because
my
mind
reverted
to
the
apprehensions
I
had
at
the
time
that
he
might
persevere
and
you
might
have
something
to
say
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
also
mentioned
to
your
sister
---
I
again
address
the
non
-
professional
Miss
Dorrit
---
that
my
son
would
have
nothing
in
the
event
of
such
a
marriage
,
and
would
be
an
absolute
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
(
I
mention
that
merely
as
a
fact
which
is
part
of
the
narrative
,
and
not
as
supposing
it
to
have
influenced
your
sister
,
except
in
the
prudent
and
legitimate
way
in
which
,
constituted
as
our
artificial
system
is
,
we
must
all
be
influenced
by
such
considerations
.
)
<EOS>
Finally
,
after
some
high
words
and
high
spirit
on
the
part
of
your
sister
,
we
came
to
the
complete
understanding
that
there
was
no
danger
;
and
your
sister
was
so
obliging
as
to
allow
me
to
present
her
with
a
mark
or
two
of
my
appreciation
at
my
dressmaker
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
looked
sorry
,
and
glanced
at
Fanny
with
a
troubled
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Also
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
as
to
promise
to
give
me
the
present
pleasure
of
a
closing
interview
,
and
of
parting
with
her
on
the
best
of
terms
.
 
<EOS>
On
which
occasion
,
"
added
Mrs
Merdle
,
quitting
her
nest
,
and
putting
something
in
Fanny
's
hand
,
"
Miss
Dorrit
will
permit
me
to
say
Farewell
with
best
wishes
in
my
own
dull
manner
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
sisters
rose
at
the
same
time
,
and
they
all
stood
near
the
cage
of
the
parrot
,
as
he
tore
at
a
claw
-
full
of
biscuit
and
spat
it
out
,
seemed
to
mock
them
with
a
pompous
dance
of
his
body
without
moving
his
feet
,
and
suddenly
turned
himself
upside
down
and
trailed
himself
all
over
the
outside
of
his
golden
cage
,
with
the
aid
of
his
cruel
beak
and
black
tongue
.
   
<EOS>
"
Adieu
,
Miss
Dorrit
,
with
best
wishes
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
we
could
only
come
to
a
Millennium
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
I
for
one
might
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
a
number
of
charming
and
talented
persons
from
whom
I
am
at
present
excluded
.
 
<EOS>
A
more
primitive
state
of
society
would
be
delicious
to
me

<EOS>
There
used
to
be
a
poem
when
I
learnt
lessons
,
something
about
Lo
the
poor
Indians
whose
something
mind

<EOS>
If
a
few
thousand
persons
moving
in

could
only
go

be
Indians

I
would
put
my
name
down

moving

we

unfortunately

Good

came
down

stairs
with
powder
before
them
and
powder
behind
,
the
elder
sister
haughty
and
the
younger
sister
humbled

were
shut
out
into
unpowdered
Harley
Street
,
Cavendish
Square

"
<EOS>
Well

said
Fanny

when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
without
speaking

"
Have
you
nothing
to
say

Amy

<EOS>
"
Oh

distressed

You

ask

to

I
am
so
very
sorry

Fanny

this

give
you
anything

<EOS>
"
You
little

returned
her
sister

shaking
her
with
the
sharp
pull
she
gave
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
spirit
at
all

<EOS>
But
that
's
just
the
way

<EOS>
You
have
no
self

respect

you
have
no

just
as
you
allow
yourself
to
be
followed
about
by
a
contemptible
little
Chivery
of
a
thing

"
with
the
scornfullest
emphasis
,
"
you
would
let
your
family
be
trodden
on
,
and
never
turn

<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that

dear
Fanny

I
do
what
I
can
for

<EOS>
"
You
do
what
you
can
for
them
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Fanny
,
walking
her
on
very
fast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
let
a
woman
like
this

whom
you
could
see

to
be

false

put

foot
upon

thank
her
for
it

<EOS>
"
No

Fanny

I
am
sure

Then
make
her
pay
for
it
,
you
mean
little
thing

<EOS>
What
else
can
you
make
her
do
?
 
<EOS>
Make
her
pay
for
it
,
you
stupid
child

and
do
your
family
some
credit
with
the
money

"
   
<EOS>
They
spoke
no
more
all
the
way
back
to
the
lodging
where
Fanny
and
her
uncle
lived
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
there
,
they
found
the
old
man
practising
his
clarionet
in
the
dolefullest
manner
in
a
corner
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
had
a
composite
meal
to
make
,
of
chops
,
and
porter
,
and
tea
;
and
indignantly
pretended
to
prepare
it
for
herself
,
though
her
sister
did
all
that
in
quiet
reality
.
 
<EOS>
When
at
last
Fanny
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink
,
she
threw
the
table
implements
about
and
was
angry
with
her
bread
,
much
as
her
father
had
been
last
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
despise
me
,
"
she
said
,
bursting
into
vehement
tears
,
"
because
I
am
a
dancer
,
why
did
you
put
me
in
the
way
of
being
one
?
   
<EOS>
It
was
your
doing
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
me
stoop
as
low
as
the
ground
before
this
Mrs
Merdle
,
and
let
her
say
what
she
liked
and
do
what
she
liked
,
and
hold
us
all
in
contempt
,
and
tell
me
so
to
my
face
.
<EOS>
Because
I
am
a
dancer
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
Fanny
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Tip
,
too
,
poor
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
to
disparage
him
just
as
much
as
she
likes
,
without
any
check
---
I
suppose
because
he
has
been
in
the
law
,
and
the
docks
,
and
different
things
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
it
was
your
doing
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
at
least
approve
of
his
being
defended
.
"
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
uncle
was
dolefully
blowing
his
clarionet
in
the
corner
,
sometimes
taking
it
an
inch
or
so
from
his
mouth
for
a
moment
while
he
stopped
to
gaze
at
them
,
with
a
vague
impression
that
somebody
had
said
something
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
your
father
,
your
poor
father
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
Because
he
is
not
free
to
show
himself
and
to
speak
for
himself
,
you
would
let
such
people
insult
him
with
impunity
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
feel
for
yourself
because
you
go
out
to
work
,
you
might
at
least
feel
for
him
,
I
should
think
,
knowing
what
he
has
undergone
so
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Little
Dorrit
felt
the
injustice
of
this
taunt
rather
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
last
night
added
a
barbed
point
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
in
reply
,
but
turned
her
chair
from
the
table
towards
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Uncle
,
after
making
one
more
pause
,
blew
a
dismal
wail
and
went
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
Fanny
was
passionate
with
the
tea
-
cups
and
the
bread
as
long
as
her
passion
lasted
,
and
then
protested
that
she
was
the
wretchedest
girl
in
the
world
,
and
she
wished
she
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
her
crying
became
remorseful
,
and
she
got
up
and
put
her
arms
round
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
tried
to
stop
her
from
saying
anything
,
but
she
answered
that
she
would
,
she
must
!
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
she
said
again
,
and
again
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Amy
,
"
and
"
Forgive
me
,
Amy
,
"
almost
as
passionately
as
she
had
said
what
she
regretted
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
indeed
,
indeed
,
Amy
,
"
she
resumed
when
they
were
seated
in
sisterly
accord
side
by
side
,
"
I
hope
<EOS>
and
I
think
you
would
have
seen
this
differently
,
if
you
had
known
a
little
more
of
Society
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
might
,
Fanny
,
"
said
the
mild
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
while
you
have
been
domestic
and
resignedly
shut
up
there
,
Amy
,
"
pursued
her
sister
,
gradually
beginning
to
patronise
,
"
I
have
been
out
,
moving
more
in
Society
,
and
may
have
been
getting
proud
and
spirited
---
more
than
I
ought
to
be
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
answered
"
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
O
yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
while
you
have
been
thinking
of
the
dinner
or
the
clothes
,
I
may
have
been
thinking
,
you
know
,
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
may
it
not
be
so
,
Amy
?
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
again
nodded
"
Yes
,
"
with
a
more
cheerful
face
than
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Especially
as
we
know
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
that
there
certainly
is
a
tone
in
the
place
to
which
you
have
been
so
true
,
which
does
belong
to
it
,
and
which
does
make
it
different
from
other
aspects
of
Society
.
 
<EOS>
So
kiss
me
once
again
,
<EOS>
Amy
dear
,
and
we
will
agree
that
we
may
both
be
right
,
and
that
you
are
a
tranquil
,
domestic
,
home
-
loving
,
good
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
clarionet
had
been
lamenting
most
pathetically
during
this
dialogue
,
but
was
cut
short
now
by
Fanny
's
announcement
that
it
was
time
to
go
;
which
she
conveyed
to
her
uncle
by
shutting
up
his
scrap
of
music
,
and
taking
the
clarionet
out
of
his
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
parted
from
them
at
the
door
,
and
hastened
back
to
the
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
It
fell
dark
there
sooner
than
elsewhere
,
and
going
into
it
<EOS>
that
evening
was
like
going
into
a
deep
trench
.
 
<EOS>
The
shadow
of
the
wall
was
on
every
object
.
 
<EOS>
Not
least
upon
the
figure
in
the
old
grey
gown
and
the
black
velvet
cap
,
as
it
turned
towards
her
when
she
opened
the
door
of
the
dim
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
upon
me
too
!
"
thought
Little
Dorrit
,
with
the
door
<EOS>
Yet
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
unreasonable
in
Fanny

Mr
Merdle
's
Complaint
 
Upon
that
establishment
of
state
,
the
Merdle
establishment
in
Harley
Street
,
Cavendish
Square
<EOS>
,
there
was
the
shadow
of
no
more
common
wall
than
the
fronts
of
other
establishments
of
state
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Like
unexceptionable
Society
,
the
opposing
rows
of
houses
in
Harley
Street
were
very
grim
with
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
mansions
and
their
inhabitants
were
so
much
alike
in
that
respect
,
that
the
people
were
often
to
be
found
drawn
up
on
opposite
sides
of
dinner
-
tables
,
in
the
shade
of
their
own
loftiness
,
staring
at
the
other
side
of
the
way
with
the
dullness
of
the
houses
.
   
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
how
like
the
street
the
two
dinner
-
rows
of
people
who
take
their
stand
by
the
street
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
expressionless
uniform
twenty
houses
,
all
to
be
knocked
at
and
rung
at
in
the
same
form
,
all
approachable
by
the
same
dull
steps
,
all
fended
off
by
the
same
pattern
of
railing
,
all
with
the
same
impracticable
fire
-
escapes
,
the
same
inconvenient
fixtures
in
their
heads
,
and
everything
without
exception
to
be
taken
at
a
high
valuation
---
who
has
not
dined
with
these
?
 
<EOS>
The
house
so
drearily
out
of
repair
,
the
occasional
bow
-
window
,
the
stuccoed
house
,
the
newly
-
fronted
house
,
the
corner
house
with
nothing
but
angular
rooms
,
the
house
with
the
blinds
always
down
,
the
house
with
the
hatchment
always
up
,
the
house
where
the
collector
has
called
for
one
quarter
of
an
Idea
,
and
found
nobody
at
home
---
who
has
not
dined
with
these
?
 
<EOS>
The
house
that
nobody
will
take
,
and
is
to
be
had
a
bargain
---
who
does
not
know
her
?
 
<EOS>
The
showy
house
that
was
taken
for
life
by
the
disappointed
gentleman
,
and
which
does
not
suit
him
at
all
---
who
is
unacquainted
with
that
haunted
habitation
?
   
<EOS>
Harley
Street
,
Cavendish
Square
,
was
more
than
aware
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
Intruders
there
were
in
Harley
Street
,
of
whom
it
was
not
aware
;
but
Mr
and
Mrs
Merdle
it
delighted
to
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Society
was
aware
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
Society
had
said
"
Let
us
license
them
;
let
us
know
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
was
immensely
rich
;
a
man
of
prodigious
enterprise
;
a
Midas
without
the
ears
,
who
turned
all
he
touched
to
gold
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
everything
good
,
from
banking
to
building
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
Parliament
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
City
,
necessarily
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
Chairman
of
this
,
Trustee
of
that
,
President
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
weightiest
of
men
had
said
to
projectors
,
"
Now
,
what
name
have
you
got
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
got
Merdle
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
the
reply
being
in
the
negative
,
had
said
,
"
Then
I
wo
n't
look
at
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
great
and
fortunate
man
had
provided
that
extensive
bosom
which
required
so
much
room
to
be
unfeeling
enough
in
,
with
a
nest
of
crimson
and
gold
some
fifteen
years
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
bosom
to
repose
upon
,
but
it
was
a
capital
bosom
to
hang
jewels
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
wanted
something
to
hang
jewels
upon
,
and
he
bought
it
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Storr
and
Mortimer
might
have
married
on
the
same
speculation
.
   
<EOS>
Like
all
his
other
speculations
,
it
was
sound
and
successful
.
 
<EOS>
The
jewels
showed
to
the
richest
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
The
bosom
moving
in
Society
with
the
jewels
displayed
upon
it
,
attracted
general
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
Society
approving
,
Mr
Merdle
was
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
most
disinterested
of
men
,
---
did
everything
for
Society
,
and
got
as
little
for
himself
out
of
all
his
gain
and
care
,
as
a
man
might
.
   
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
it
may
be
supposed
that
he
got
all
he
wanted
,
otherwise
with
unlimited
wealth
he
would
have
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
desire
was
to
the
utmost
to
satisfy
Society
(
whatever
that
was
)
,
and
take
up
all
its
drafts
upon
him
for
tribute
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
shine
in
company
;
he
had
not
very
much
to
say
for
himself
;
he
was
a
reserved
man
,
with
a
broad
,
overhanging
,
watchful
head
,
that
particular
kind
of
dull
red
colour
in
his
cheeks
which
is
rather
stale
than
fresh
,
and
a
somewhat
uneasy
expression
about
his
coat
-
cuffs
,
as
if
they
were
in
his
confidence
,
and
had
reasons
for
being
anxious
to
hide
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
little
he
said
,
he
was
a
pleasant
man
enough
;
plain
,
emphatic
about
public
and
private
confidence
,
and
tenacious
of
the
utmost
deference
being
shown
by
every
one
,
in
all
things
,
to
Society
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
same
Society
(
if
that
were
it
which
came
to
his
dinners
,
and
to
Mrs
Merdle
's
receptions
and
concerts
)
,
he
hardly
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
much
,
and
was
mostly
to
be
found
against
walls
and
behind
doors
.
 
<EOS>
Also
when
he
went
out
to
it
,
instead
of
its
coming
home
to
him
,
he
seemed
a
little
fatigued
,
and
upon
the
whole
rather
more
disposed
for
bed
;
but
he
was
always
cultivating
it
nevertheless
,
and
always
moving
in
it
---
and
always
laying
out
money
on
it
with
the
greatest
liberality
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
's
first
husband
had
been
a
colonel
,
under
whose
auspices
the
bosom
had
entered
into
competition
with
the
snows
of
North
America
,
and
had
come
off
at
little
disadvantage
in
point
of
whiteness
,
and
at
none
in
point
of
coldness
.
 
<EOS>
The
colonel
's
son
was
Mrs
Merdle
's
only
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
of
a
chuckle
-
headed
,
high
-
shouldered
make
,
with
a
general
appearance
of
being
,
not
so
much
a
young
man
as
a
swelled
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
given
so
few
signs
of
reason
,
that
a
by
-
word
went
among
his
companions
that
his
brain
had
been
frozen
up
in
a
mighty
frost
which
prevailed
at
St
john
's
,
New
Brunswick
,
at
the
period
of
his
birth
there
,
and
had
never
thawed
from
that
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Another
by
-
word
represented
him
as
having
in
his
infancy
,
through
the
negligence
of
a
nurse
,
fallen
out
of
a
high
window
on
his
head
,
which
had
been
heard
by
responsible
witnesses
to
crack
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
probable
that
both
these
representations
were
of
ex
post
facto
origin
;
the
young
gentleman
(
whose
expressive
name
was
Sparkler
)
being
monomaniacal
in
offering
marriage
to
all
manner
of
undesirable
young
ladies
,
and
in
remarking
of
every
successive
young
lady
to
whom
he
tendered
a
matrimonial
proposal
that
she
was
"
a
doosed
fine
gal
---
well
educated
too
---
with
no
biggodd
nonsense
about
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
son
-
in
-
law
with
these
limited
talents
,
might
have
been
a
clog
upon
another
man
;
but
Mr
Merdle
did
not
want
a
son
-
in
-
law
for
himself
;
he
wanted
a
son
-
in
-
law
for
Society
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
having
been
in
the
Guards
,
and
being
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
all
the
races
,
and
all
the
lounges
,
and
all
the
parties
,
and
being
well
known
,
Society
was
satisfied
with
its
son
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
This
happy
result
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
would
have
considered
well
attained
,
though
Mr
Sparkler
had
been
a
more
expensive
article
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
did
not
get
Mr
Sparkler
by
any
means
cheap
for
Society
,
even
as
it
was
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dinner
giving
in
the
Harley
Street
establishment
,
while
Little
Dorrit
was
stitching
at
her
father
's
new
shirts
by
his
side
that
night
;
and
there
were
magnates
from
the
Court
and
magnates
from
the
City
,
magnates
from
the
Commons
and
magnates
from
the

magnates

all

going

sometimes
trip
us
up

<EOS>
"
I
am
told

"
said
Bishop
magnate
to
Horse
Guards
,
"
that
Mr
Merdle
has
made
another
enormous
hit
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
a
hundred
thousand
pounds

Horse

two

Treasury
had

three

<EOS>
Bar
,
handling
his
persuasive
double
eye
-
glass
,
was
by
no
means
clear
but
that
it
might
be
four

<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
happy
strokes
of
calculation
and
combination
,
the
result
of
which
it
was
difficult
to
estimate
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
instances
of
a
comprehensive
grasp
,
associated
with
habitual
luck
and
characteristic
boldness
,
of
which
an
age
presented
us
but
few
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
was
Brother
Bellows
,
who
had
been
in
the
great
Bank
case
,
and
who
could
probably
tell
us
more
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
Brother
Bellows
put
this
new
success
at
?
   
<EOS>
Brother
Bellows
was
on
his
way
to
make
his
bow
to
the
bosom
,
and
could
only
tell
them
in
passing
that
he
had
heard
it
stated
,
with
great
appearance
of
truth
,
as
being
worth
,
from
first
to
last
,
half
-
a

million
of
money
.

man
,
Treasury
said
he
was
a
new
power
in
the
country
,
and
would
be
able
to
buy
up
the
whole
House
of
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
said
he
was
glad
to
think
that
this
wealth
flowed
into
the
coffers
of
a
gentleman
who
was
always
disposed
to
maintain
the
best
interests
of
Society
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
himself
was
usually
late
on
these
occasions
,
as
a
man
still
detained
in
the
clutch
of
giant
enterprises
when
other
men
had
shaken
off
their
dwarfs
for
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
he
was
the
last
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
Treasury
said
Merdle
's
work
punished
him
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
said
he
was
glad
to
think
that
this
wealth
flowed
into
the
coffers
of
a
gentleman
who
accepted
it
with
meekness
.
   
<EOS>
Powder
!
 
<EOS>
There
was
so
much
Powder
in
waiting
,
that
it
flavoured
the
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Pulverous
particles
got
into
the
dishes
,
and
Society
's
meats
had
a
seasoning
of
first
-
rate
footmen
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
took
down
a
countess
who
was
secluded
somewhere
in
the
core
of
an
immense
dress
,
to
which
she
was
in
the
proportion
of
the
heart
to
the
overgrown
cabbage
.
 
<EOS>
If
so
low
a
simile
may
be
admitted
,
the
dress
went
down
the
staircase
like
a
richly
brocaded
Jack
in
the
Green
,
and
nobody
knew
what
sort
of
small
person
carried
it
.
   
<EOS>
Society
had
everything
it
could
want
,
and
could
not
want
,
for
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
everything
to
look
at
,
and
everything
to
eat
,
and
everything
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
hoped
it
enjoyed
itself
;
for
Mr
Merdle
's
own
share
of
the
repast
might
have
been
paid
for
with
eighteenpence
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
was
magnificent
.
 
<EOS>
The
chief
butler
was
the
next
magnificent
institution
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
stateliest
man
in
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
nothing
,
but
he
looked
on
as
few
other
men
could
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
Mr
Merdle
's
last
gift
to
Society
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
did
n't
want
him
,
and
was
put
out
of
countenance
when
the
great
creature
looked
at
him
;
but
inappeasable
Society
would
have
him
---
and
had
got
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
invisible
countess
carried
out
the
Green
at
the
usual
stage
of
the
entertainment
,
and
the
file
of
beauty
was
closed
up
by
the
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Treasury
said
,
Juno
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
said
,
Judith
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
fell
into
discussion
with
Horse
Guards
concerning
courts
-
martial
.
<EOS>
Brothers
Bellows
and
Bench
struck
in
.
 
<EOS>
Other
magnates
paired
off
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
sat
silent
,
and
looked
at
the
table
-
cloth
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
a
magnate
addressed
him
,
to
turn
the
stream
of
his
own
particular
discussion
towards
him
;
but
Mr
Merdle
seldom
gave
much
attention
to
it
,
or
did
more
than
rouse
himself
from
his
calculations
and
pass
the
wine
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
rose
,
so
many
of
the
magnates
had
something
to
say
to
Mr
Merdle
individually
that
he
held
little
levees
by
the
sideboard
,
and
checked
them
off
as
they
went
out
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Treasury
hoped
he
might
venture
to
congratulate
one
of
England
's
world
-
famed
capitalists
and
merchant
-
princes
<EOS>
(
he
had
turned
that
original
sentiment
in
the
house
a
few
times
,
and
it
came
easy
to
him
)
on
a
new
achievement
.
 
<EOS>
To
extend
the
triumphs
of
such
men
was
to
extend
the
triumphs
and
resources
of
the
nation
;
and
Treasury
felt
---
he
gave
Mr
Merdle
to
understand
---
patriotic
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
;
"
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
accept
your
congratulations
with
pride
,
and
I
am
glad
you
approve
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
unreservedly
approve
,
my
dear
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
"
smiling
Treasury
turned
him
by
the
arm
towards
the
sideboard
and
spoke
banteringly
,
"
it
never
can
be
worth
your
while
to
come
among
us
and
help
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
felt
honoured
by
the
---
   
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Treasury
,
"
that
is
not
the
light
in
which
one
so
distinguished
for
practical
knowledge
and
great
foresight
,
can
be
expected
to
regard
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
should
ever
be
happily
enabled
,
by
accidentally
possessing
the
control
over
circumstances
,
to
propose
to
one
so
eminent
to
---
to
come
among
us
,
and
give
us
the
weight
of
his
influence
,
knowledge
,
and
character
,
we
could
only
propose
it
to
him
as
a
duty
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
as
a
duty
that
he
owed
to
Society
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
intimated
that
Society
was
the
apple
of
his
eye
,
and
that
its
claims
were
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Treasury
moved
on
,
and
Bar
came
up
.
<EOS>
Bar
,
with
his
little
insinuating
jury
droop
,
and
fingering
his
persuasive
double
eye
-
glass
,
hoped
he
might
be
excused
if
he
mentioned
to
one
of
the
greatest
converters
of
the
root
of
all
evil
into
the
root
of
all
good
,
who
had
for
a
long
time
reflected
a
shining
lustre
on
the
annals
even
of
our
commercial
country
---
if
he
mentioned
,
disinterestedly
,
and
as
,
what
we
lawyers
called
in
our
pedantic
way
,
amicus
curiae
,
a
fact
that
had
come
by
accident
within
his
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
required
to
look
over
the
title
of
a
very
considerable
estate
in
one
of
the
eastern
counties
---
lying
,
in
fact
,
for
Mr
Merdle
knew
we
lawyers
loved
to
be
particular
,
on
the
borders
of
two
of
the
eastern
counties
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
title
was
perfectly
sound
,
and
the
estate
was
to
be
purchased
by
one
who
had
the
command
of
---
Money
(
jury
droop
and
persuasive
eye
-
glass
)
,
on
remarkably
advantageous
terms
.
 
<EOS>
This
had
come
to
Bar
's
knowledge
only
that
day
,
and
it
had
occurred
to
him
,
"
I
shall
have
the
honour
of
dining
with
my
esteemed
friend
Mr
Merdle
this
evening
,
and
,
strictly
between
ourselves
,
I
will
mention
the
opportunity
.
"
 
<EOS>
Such
a
purchase
would
involve
not
only
a
great
legitimate
political
influence
,
but
some
half
-
dozen
church
presentations
of
considerable
annual
value
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
that
Mr
Merdle
was
already
at
no
loss
to
discover
means
of
occupying
even
his
capital
,
and
of
fully
employing
even
his
active
and
vigorous
intellect
,
<EOS>
Bar
well
knew
:
but
he
would
venture
to
suggest
that
the
question
arose
in
his
mind
,
whether
one
who
had
deservedly
gained
so
high
a
position
and
<EOS>
so
European
a
reputation
did
not
owe
it
---
we
would
not
say
to
himself
,
but
we
would
say
to
Society
,
to
possess
himself
of
such
influences
as
these
;
and
to
exercise
them
---
we
would
not
say
for
his
own
,
or
for
his
party
's
,
but
we
would
say
for
Society
's
---
benefit
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
again
expressed
himself
as
wholly
devoted
to
that
object
of
his
constant
consideration
,
and
Bar
took
his
persuasive
eye
-
glass
up
the
grand
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
then
came
undesignedly
sidling
in
the
direction
of
the
sideboard
.
   
<EOS>
Surely
the
goods
of
this
world
,
it
occurred
in
an
accidental
way
to
Bishop
to
remark
,
could
scarcely
be
directed
into
happier
channels
than
when
they
accumulated
under
the
magic
touch
of
the
wise
and
sagacious
,
who
,
while
they
knew
the
just
value
of
riches
(
Bishop
tried
here
to
look
as
if
he
were
rather
poor
himself
)
,
were
aware
of
their
importance
,
judiciously
governed
and
rightly
distributed
,
to
the
welfare
of
our
brethren
at
large
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
with
humility
expressed
his
conviction
that
Bishop
could
n't
mean
him
,
and
with
inconsistency
expressed
his
high
gratification
in
Bishop
's
good
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
Bishop
then
---
jauntily
stepping
out
a
little
with
his
well
-
shaped
right
leg
,
as
though
he
said
to
Mr
Merdle
"
do
n't
mind
the
apron
;
<EOS>
a
mere
form
!
"
put
this
case
to
his
good
friend
:
   
<EOS>
Whether
it
had
occurred
to
his
good
friend
,
that
Society
might
not
unreasonably
hope
that
one
so
blest
in
his
undertakings
,
and
whose
example
on
his
pedestal
was
so
influential
with
it
,
would
shed
a
little
money
in
the
direction
of
a
mission
or
so
to
Africa
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
signifying
that
the
idea
should
have
his
best
attention
,
Bishop
put
another
case
:
   
<EOS>
Whether
his
good
friend
had
at
all
interested
himself
in
the
proceedings
of
our
Combined
Additional
Endowed
Dignitaries
Committee
,
and
whether
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
to
shed
a
little
money
in
that
direction
might
be
a
great
conception
finely
executed
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
made
a
similar
reply
,
and
Bishop
explained
his
reason
for
inquiring
.
   
<EOS>
Society
looked
to
such
men
as
his
good
friend
to
do
such
things
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
HE
looked
to
them
,
but
that
Society
looked
to
them
.
   
<EOS>
just
as
it
was
not
Our
Committee
who
wanted
the
Additional
Endowed
Dignitaries
,
but
it
was
Society
that
was
in
a
state
of
the
most
agonising
uneasiness
of
mind
until
it
got
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
begged
to
assure
his
good
friend
that
he
was
extremely
sensible
of
his
good
friend
's
regard
on
all
occasions
for
the
best
interests
of
Society
;
and
he
considered
that
he
was
at
once
consulting
those
interests
and
expressing
the
feeling
of
Society
,
when
he
wished
him
continued
prosperity
,
continued
increase
of
riches
,
and
continued
things
in
general
.
   
<EOS>
Bishop
then
betook
himself
up
-
stairs
,
and
the
other
magnates
gradually
floated
up
after
him
until
there
was
no
one
left
below
but
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
That
gentleman
,
after
looking
at
the
table
-
cloth
until
the
soul
of
the
chief
butler
glowed
with
a
noble
resentment
,
went
slowly
up
after
the
rest
,
and
became
of
no
account
in
the
stream
of
people
on
the
grand
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
was
at
home
,
the
best
of
the
jewels
were
hung
out
to
be
seen
,
Society
got
what
it
came
for
,
Mr
Merdle
drank
twopennyworth
of
tea
in
a
corner
and
got
more
than
he
wanted
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
evening
magnates
was
a
famous
physician
,
who
knew
everybody
,
and
whom
everybody
knew
.
 
<EOS>
On
entering
at
the
door
,
he
came
upon
Mr
Merdle
drinking
his
tea
in
a
corner
,
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
started
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Any
better
to
-
day
?
"
   
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
I
am
no
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
pity
<EOS>
I
did
n't
see
you
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
come
to
me
to
-
morrow
,
or
let
me
come
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
"
   
"
Well
!
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
to
-
morrow
as
I
drive
by
.
<EOS>
"
Bar
and
Bishop
had
both
been
bystanders
during
this
short
dialogue
,
and
as
Mr
Merdle
was
swept
away
by
the
crowd
,
they
made
their
remarks
upon
it
to
the
Physician
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
said
,
there
was
a
certain
point
of
mental
strain
beyond
which
no
man
could
go
;
that
the
point
varied
with
various
textures
of
brain
and
peculiarities
of
constitution
,
as
he
had
had
occasion
to
notice
in
several
of
his
learned
brothers
;
but
the
point
of
endurance
passed
by
a
line
's
breadth
,
depression
and
dyspepsia
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
intrude
on
the
sacred
mysteries
of
medicine
,
he
took
it
,
now
(
with
the
jury
droop
and
persuasive
eye
-
glass
)
,
that
this
was
Merdle
's
case
?
 
<EOS>
Bishop
said
that
when
he
was
a
young
man
,
and
had
fallen
for
a
brief
space
into
the
habit
of
writing
sermons
on
Saturdays
,
a
habit
which
all
young
sons
of
the
church
should
sedulously
avoid
,
he
had
frequently
been
sensible
of
a
depression
,
arising
as
he
supposed
from
an
over
-
taxed
intellect
,
upon
which
the
yolk
of
a
new
-
laid
egg
,
beaten
up
by
the
good
woman
in
whose
house
he
at
that
time
lodged
,
with
a
glass
of
sound
sherry
,
nutmeg
,
and
powdered
sugar
acted
like
a
charm
.
 
<EOS>
Without
presuming
to
offer
so
simple
a
remedy
to
the
consideration
of
so
profound
a
professor
of
the
great
healing
art
,
he
would
venture
to
inquire
whether
the
strain
,
being
by
way
of
intricate
calculations
,
the
spirits
might
not
(
humanly
speaking
)
be
restored
to
their
tone
by
a
gentle
and
yet
generous
stimulant
?
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
physician
,
"
yes
,
you
are
both
right
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
may
as
well
tell
you
that
I
can
find
nothing
the
matter
with
Mr
Merdle
.
<EOS>
He
has
the
constitution
of
a
rhinoceros
,
the
digestion
of
an
ostrich
,
and
the
concentration
of
an
oyster
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
nerves
,
Mr
Merdle
is
of
a
cool
temperament
,
and
not
a
sensitive
man
:
is
about
as
invulnerable
,
I
should
say
,
as
Achilles
.
 
<EOS>
How
such
a
man
should
suppose
himself
unwell
without
reason
,
you
may
think
strange
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
found
nothing
the
matter
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
some
deep
-
seated
recondite
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
say
,
that
at
present
I
have
not
found
it
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
shadow
of
Mr
Merdle
's
complaint
on
the
bosom
now
displaying
precious
stones
in
rivalry
with
many
similar
superb
jewel
-
stands
;
there
was
no
shadow
of
Mr
Merdle
's
complaint
on
young
Sparkler
hovering
about
the
rooms
,
monomaniacally
seeking
any
sufficiently
ineligible
young
lady
with
no
nonsense
about
her
;
there
was
no
shadow
of
Mr
Merdle
's
complaint
on
the
Barnacles
and
Stiltstalkings
,
of
whom
whole
colonies
were
present
;
or
on
any
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
Even
on
himself
,
its
shadow
was
faint
enough
as
he
moved
about
among
the
throng
,
receiving
homage
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
's
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
Society
<EOS>
and
he
had
so
much
to

with
one
another
in

else
,
that
it
is
hard
to
imagine
his
complaint
,
if
he
had
one

being
solely
his
own
affair

<EOS>
Had
he
that
deep

seated
recondite
complaint
,
and
did
any
doctor
find
it
out
?
<EOS>
Patience

<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
the
shadow
of
the
Marshalsea
wall
was
a
real
darkening
influence
,
and
could
be
seen
on
the
Dorrit
Family
at
any
stage
of
the

<EOS>
A
Puzzle
 
Mr
Clennam
did
not
increase
in
favour
with
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
in
the
ratio
of
his
increasing
visits
.
 
<EOS>
His
obtuseness
on
the
great
Testimonial
question
was
not
calculated
to
awaken
admiration
in
the
paternal
breast
,
but
had
rather
a
tendency
to
give
offence
in
that
sensitive
quarter
,
and
to
be
regarded
as
a
positive
shortcoming
in
point
of
gentlemanly
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
An
impression
of
disappointment
,
occasioned
by
the
discovery
that
Mr
Clennam
scarcely
possessed
that
delicacy
for
which
,
in
the
confidence
of
his
nature
,
he
had
been
inclined
to
give
him
credit
,
began
to
darken
the
fatherly
mind
in
connection
with
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
went
so
far
as
to
say
,
in
his
private
family
circle
,
that
he
feared
Mr
Clennam
was
not
a
man
of
high
instincts
.
<EOS>
He
was
happy
,
he
observed
,
in
his
public
capacity
as
leader
and
representative
of
the
College
,
to
receive
Mr
Clennam
when
he
called
to
pay
his
respects
;
but
he
did
n't
find
that
he
got
on
with
him
personally
.
 
<EOS>
There
appeared
to
be
something
(
he
did
n't
know
what
it
was
)
wanting
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
the
father
did
not
fail
in
any
outward
show
of
politeness
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
honoured
him
with
much
attention
;
perhaps
cherishing
the
hope
that
,
although
not
a
man
of
a
sufficiently
brilliant
and
spontaneous
turn
of
mind
to
repeat
his
former
testimonial
unsolicited
,
it
might
still
be
within
the
compass
of
his
nature
to
bear
the
part
of
a
responsive
gentleman
,
in
any
correspondence
that
way
tending
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
threefold
capacity
,
of
the
gentleman
from
outside
who
had
been
accidentally
locked
in
on
the
night
of
his
first
appearance
,
of
the
gentleman
from
outside
who
had
inquired
into
the
affairs
of
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
with
the
stupendous
idea
of
getting
him
out
,
and
of
the
gentleman
from
outside
who
took
an
interest
in
the
child
of
the
Marshalsea
,
Clennam
soon
became
a
visitor
of
mark
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
not
surprised
by
the
attentions
he
received
from
Mr
Chivery
when
that
officer
was
on
the
lock
,
for
he
made
little
distinction
between
Mr
Chivery
's
politeness
and
that
of
the
other
turnkeys
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
on
one
particular
afternoon
that
Mr
Chivery
surprised
him
all
at
once
,
and
stood
forth
from
his
companions
in
bold
relief
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chivery
,
by
some
artful
exercise
of
his
power
of
clearing
the
Lodge
,
had
contrived
to
rid
it
of
all
sauntering
Collegians
;
so
that
Clennam
,
coming
out
of
the
prison
,
should
find
him
on
duty
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
(
Private
)
<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chivery
in
a
secret
manner
;
"
but
which
way
might
you
be
going
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
over
the
Bridge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
saw
in
Mr
Chivery
,
with
some
astonishment
,
quite
an
Allegory
of
Silence
,
as
he
stood
with
his
key
on
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
(
Private
)
<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
again
,
"
said
Mr
Chivery
,
"
but
could
you
go
round
by
Horsemonger
Lane
?
 
<EOS>
Could
you
by
any
means
find
time
to
look
in
at
that
address
?
"
<EOS>
handing
him
a
little
card
,
printed
for
circulation
among
the
connection
of
Chivery
and

Tobacconists

said
Mr
Chivery
.
 
<EOS>
"
The

,
it
's
my

<EOS>
She
's
wishful
to
say
a
word
to
you
,

upon
a

said
Mr
Chivery
,
answering
Clennam
's
look
of
apprehension
with
a
nod
,
"
respecting
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
a
point
of
seeing
your

<EOS>
"
Thank

Much

It

ten
minutes
out

<EOS>
Please
to
ask
for
Mrs
Chivery
!
"
 
<EOS>
These
instructions
,
Mr
Chivery
,
who
had
already
let
him
out
,
cautiously
called
through
a
little
slide
in
the
outer
door
,
which
he
could
draw
back
from
within
for
the
inspection
of
visitors
when
it
pleased
him
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
,
with
the
card
in
his
hand
,
betook
himself
to
the
address
set
forth
upon
it
,
and
speedily
arrived
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
small
establishment
<EOS>
,
wherein
a
decent
woman
sat
behind
the
counter
working
at
her
needle
.
 
<EOS>
Little
jars
of
tobacco
,
little
boxes
of
cigars
,
a
little
assortment
of
pipes
,
a
little
jar
or
two
of
snuff
,
and
a
little
instrument
like
a
shoeing
horn
for
serving
it
out
,
composed
the
retail
stock
in
trade
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
mentioned
his
name
,
and
his
having
promised
to
call
,
on
the
solicitation
of
Mr
Chivery
.
 
<EOS>
About
something
relating
to
Miss
Dorrit
,
he
believed
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Chivery
at
once
laid
aside
her
work
,
rose
up
from
her
seat
behind
the
counter
,
and
deploringly
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
see
him
now
,
"
said
she
,
"
if
you
'll
condescend
to
take
a
peep
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
mysterious
words
,
she
preceded
the
visitor
into
a
little
parlour
behind
the
shop
,
with
a
little
window
in
it
commanding
a
very
little
dull
back
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
yard
a
wash
of
sheets
and
table
-
cloths
tried
(
in
vain
,
for
want
of
air
)
to
get
itself
dried
on
a
line
or
two
;
and
among
those
flapping
articles
was
sitting
in
a
chair
,
like
the
last
mariner
left
alive
on
the
deck
of
a
damp
ship
without
the
power
of
furling
the
sails
,
a
little
woe
-
begone
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
John
,
"
said
Mrs
Chivery
.
   
<EOS>
Not
to
be
deficient
in
interest
,
Clennam
asked
what
he
might
be
doing
there
?
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
only
change
he
takes
,
"
said
Mrs
Chivery
,
shaking
her
head
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
go
out
,
even
in
the
back
-
yard
,
when
there
's
no
linen
;
but
when
there
's
linen
to
keep
the
neighbours
'
eyes
off
,
he
'll
sit
there
,
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Hours
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
Says
he
feels
as
if
it
was
groves

"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Chivery
shook
her
head
again
,
put
her
apron
in
a
motherly
way
to
her
eyes
,
and
reconducted
her
visitor
into
the
regions
of
the
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
Please
to
take
a
seat
,
sir

"
said
Mrs
Chivery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dorrit
is
the
matter
with
Our
John
,
sir
;
he
's
a
breaking
his
heart
for
her
,
and
I
would
wish
to
take
the
liberty
to
ask
how
it
's
to
be
made
good
to
his
parents
when
bust
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Chivery
,
who
was
a
comfortable
-
looking
woman
much
respected
about
Horsemonger
Lane
for
her
feelings
and
her
conversation
,
uttered
this
speech
with
fell
composure
,
and
immediately
afterwards
began
again
to
shake
her
head
and
dry
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
she
in
continuation
,
"
you
are
acquainted
with
the
family
,
and
have
interested
yourself
with
the
family
,
and
are
influential
with
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
can
promote
views
calculated
to
make
two
young
people
happy
,
let
me
,
for
Our
john
's
sake
,
and
for
both
their
sakes
,
implore
you
so
to
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
so
habituated
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
at
a
loss
,
"
during
the
short
time
I
have
known
her
,
to
consider
Little
---
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
habituated
to
consider
Miss
Dorrit
in
a
light
altogether
removed
from
that
in
which
you
present
her
to
me
,
that
you
quite
take
me
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
Does
she
know
your
son
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Brought
up
together
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Chivery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Played
together
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
she
know
your
son
as
her
admirer
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
bless
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Chivery
,
with
a
sort
of
triumphant
shiver
,
"
she
never
could
have
seen
him
on
a
Sunday
without
knowing
he
was
that
.
 
<EOS>
His
cane
alone
would
have
told
it
long
ago
,
if
nothing
else
had
.
 
<EOS>
Young
men
like
John
do
n't
take
to
ivory
hands
a
pinting
,
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
How
did
I
first
know
it
myself
?
 
<EOS>
Similarly
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Perhaps
Miss
Dorrit
may
not
be
so
ready
as
you
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
she
knows
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Chivery
,
"
by
word
of
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Chivery
,
"
sure
and
certain
as
in
this
house
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
see
my
son
go
out
with
my
own
eyes
when
in
this
house
I
was
,
and
I
see
my
son
come
in
with
my
own
eyes
when
in
this
house
I
was
,
and
I
know
he
done
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Chivery
derived
a
surprising
force
of
emphasis
from
the
foregoing
circumstantiality
and
repetition
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
you
how
he
came
to
fall
into
the
desponding
state
which
causes
you
so
much
uneasiness
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
Mrs
Chivery
,
"
took
place
on
that
same
day
when
to
this
house
I
see
that
John
with
these
eyes
return
.
 
<EOS>
Never
been
himself
in
this
house
since
.
 
<EOS>
Never
was
like
what
he
has
been
since
,
not
from
the
hour
when
to
this
house
seven
year
ago
me
and
his
father
,
as
tenants
by
the
quarter
,
came
!
"
 
<EOS>
An
effect
in
the
nature
of
an
affidavit
was
gained
from
this
speech
by
Mrs
Chivery
's
peculiar
power
of
construction
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
venture
to
inquire
what
is
your
version
of
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
"
said
Mrs
Chivery
,
"
and
I
will
give
it
to
you
in
honour
and
in
word
as
true
as
in
this
shop
<EOS>
I
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Our
John
has
every
one
's
good
word
and
every
one
's
good
wish
.
 
<EOS>
He
played
with
her
as
a
child
when
in
that
yard
a
child
she
played
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
known
her
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
out
upon
the
Sunday
afternoon
when
in
this
very
parlour
he
had
dined
,
and
met
her
,
with
appointment
or
without
appointment
;
which
,
I
do
not
pretend
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
his
offer
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
brother
and
sister
is
high
in
their
views
,
and
against
Our
John
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
is
all
for
himself
in
his
views
and
against
sharing
her
with
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Under
which
circumstances
she
has
answered
Our
John
,
"
No
,
John
,
I
can
not
have
you
,
I
can
not
have
any
husband
,
it
is
not
my
intentions
ever
to
become
a
wife
,
it
is
my
intentions
to
be
always
a
sacrifice
,
farewell
,
find
another
worthy
of
you
,
and
forget
me
!
"
<EOS>
This
is
the
way
in
which
she
is
doomed
to
be
a
constant
slave
to
them
that
are
not
worthy
that
a
constant
slave
she
unto
them
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
way
in
which
Our
John
has
come
to
find
no
pleasure
but
in
taking
cold
among
the
linen
,
and
in
showing
in
that
yard
,
as
in
that
yard
I
have
myself
shown
you
,
a
broken
-
down
ruin
that
goes
home
to
his
mother
's
heart
!
"
<EOS>
Here
the
good
woman
pointed
to
the
little
window
,
whence
her
son
might
be
seen
sitting
disconsolate
in
the
tuneless
groves
;
and
again
shook
her
head
and
wiped
her
eyes
,
and
besought
him
,
for
the
united
sakes
of
both
the
young
people
,
to
exercise
his
influence
towards
the
bright
reversal
of
these
dismal
events
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
so
confident
in
her
exposition
of
the
case
,
and
it
was
so
undeniably
founded
on
correct
premises
in
so
far
as
the
relative
positions
of
Little
Dorrit
and
her
family
were
concerned
,
that
Clennam
could
not
feel
positive
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
attach
to
Little
Dorrit
an
interest
so
peculiar
---
an
interest
that
removed
her
from
,
while
it
grew
out
of
,
the
common
and
coarse
things
surrounding
her
---
that
he
found
it
disappointing
,
disagreeable
,
almost
painful
,
to
suppose
her
in
love
with
young
Mr
Chivery
in
the
back
-
yard
,
or
any
such
person
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
he
reasoned
with
himself
that
she
was
just
as
good
and
just
as
true
in
love
with
him
,
as
not
in
love
with
him
;
and
that
to
make
a
kind
of
domesticated
fairy
of
her
,
on
the
penalty
of
isolation
at
heart
from
the
only
people
she
knew
,
would
be
but
a
weakness
of
his
own
fancy
,
and
not
a
kind
one
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
her
youthful
and
ethereal
appearance
,
her
timid
manner
,
the
charm
of
her
sensitive
voice
and
eyes
,
the
very
many
respects
in
which
she
had
interested
him
out
of
her
own
individuality
,
and
the
strong
difference
between
herself
and
those
about
her
,
were
not
in
unison
,
and
were
determined
not
to
be
in
unison
,
with
this
newly
presented
idea
.
   
<EOS>
He
told
the
worthy
Mrs
Chivery
,
after
turning
these
things
over
in
his
mind
---
he
did
that
,
indeed
,
while
she
was
yet
speaking
---
that
he
might
be
relied
upon
to
do
his
utmost
at
all
times
to
promote
the
happiness
of
Miss
Dorrit
,
and
to
further
the
wishes
of
her
heart
if
it
were
in
his
power
to
do
so
,
and
if
he
could
discover
what
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
cautioned
her
against
assumptions
and
appearances
;
enjoined
strict
silence
and
secrecy
,
lest
Miss
Dorrit
should
be
made
unhappy
;
and
particularly
advised
her
to
endeavour
to
win
her
son
's
confidence
and
so
to
make
quite
sure
of
the
state
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Chivery
considered
the
latter
precaution
superfluous
,
but
said
she
would
try
.
 
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
as
if
she
had
not
derived
all
the
comfort
she
had
fondly
expected
from
this
interview
,
but
thanked
him
nevertheless
for
the
trouble
he
had
kindly
taken
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
parted
good
friends
,
and
Arthur
walked
away
.
   
<EOS>
The
crowd
in
the
street
jostling
the
crowd
in
his
mind
,
and
the
two
crowds
making
a
confusion
,
he
avoided
London
Bridge
,
and
turned
off
in
the
quieter
direction
of
the
Iron
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
set
foot
upon
it
,
when
he
saw
Little
Dorrit
walking
on
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
pleasant
day
,
with
a
light
breeze
blowing
,
and
she
seemed
to
have
that
minute
come
there
for
air
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
left
her
in
her
father
's
room
within
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
timely
chance
,
favourable
to
his
wish
of
observing
her
face
and
manner
when
no
one
else
was
by
.
 
<EOS>
He
quickened
his
pace
;
but
before
he
reached
her
,
she
turned
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
startled
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
knew
the
step
,
"
she
answered
,
hesitating
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
did
you
know
it
,
Little
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
You
could
hardly
have
expected
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
expect
any
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
heard
a
step
,
I
thought
it
---
sounded
like
yours
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
further
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
am
only
walking
her
for
a
little
change
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
walked
together
,
and
she
recovered
her
confiding
manner
with
him
,
and
looked
up
in
his
face
as
she
said
,
after
glancing
around
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
strange
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
can
hardly
understand
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
have
a
sensation
as
if
it
was
almost
unfeeling
to
walk
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unfeeling
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
see
the
river
,
and
so
much
sky
,
and
so
many
objects
,
and
such
change
and
motion
.
 
<EOS>
Then
to
go
back
,
you
know
,
and
find
him
in
the
same
cramped
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
yes
!
 
<EOS>
But
going
back
,
you
must
remember
that
you
take
with
you
the
spirit
and
influence
of
such
things
to
cheer
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
you
fancy
too
much
,
sir
,
and
make
me
out
too
powerful
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
were
in
prison
,
could
I
bring
such
comfort
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Little
Dorrit
,
I
am
sure
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
gathered
from
a
tremor
on
her
lip
,
and
a
passing
shadow
of
great
agitation
on
her
face
,
that
her
mind
was
with
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
,
that
she
might
regain
her
composure
.
 
<EOS>
The
Little
Dorrit
,
trembling
on
his
arm
,
was
less
in
unison
than
ever
with
Mrs
Chivery
's
theory
,
and
yet
was
not
irreconcilable
with
a
new
fancy
which
sprung
up
within
him
,
that
there
might
be
some
one
else
in
the
hopeless
---
newer
fancy
still
---
in
the
hopeless
unattainable
distance
.
   
<EOS>
They
turned
,
and
Clennam
said
,
Here
was
Maggy
coming
!
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
looked
up
,
surprised
,
and
they
confronted
Maggy
,
who
brought
herself
at
sight
of
them
to
a
dead
stop
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
trotting
along
,
so
preoccupied
and
busy
that
she
had
not
recognised
them
until
they
turned
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
now
in
a
moment
<EOS>
so
conscience
-
stricken
that
her
very
basket
partook
of
the
change
.
   
<EOS>
"
Maggy
,
you
promised
me
to
stop
near
father
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
would
,
Little
Mother
,
only
he
would
n't
let
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
takes
and
sends
me
out
I
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
takes
and
says
,
"
Maggy
,
you
hurry
away
and
back
with
that
letter
,
and
you
shall
have
a
sixpence
if
the
answer
's
a
good
'
un
,
"
I
must
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lor
,
Little
Mother
<EOS>
,
what
's
a
poor
thing
of
ten
year
old
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
Mr
Tip
---
if
he
happens
to
be
a
coming
in
as
I
come
out
,
and
if
he
says
"
Where
are
you
going
,
Maggy
?
"
<EOS>
and
if
I
says
,
"
I
'm
a
going
<EOS>
So
<EOS>
and
So
,
"
and
if
he
says
,
"
I
'll
have
a
Try
too
,
"
and
if
he
goes
into
the
George
and
writes
a
letter
and
if
he
gives
it
me
and
says
,
"
<EOS>
Take
that
one
to
the
same
place
,
and
if
the
answer
's
a
good
'
un
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
a
shilling
,
"
it
ai
n't
my
fault
,
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
read
,
in
Little
Dorrit
's
downcast
eyes
,
to
whom
she
foresaw
that
the
letters
were
addressed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
going
<EOS>
So
<EOS>
and
So
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
where
I
am
a
going
to
,
"
said
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
going
<EOS>
So
<EOS>
and
So
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
you

Little
Mother

that
's
got
anything
to
do
with
it
<EOS>
---
it
's
you
,
you
know

"
said
Maggy
,
addressing
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
come
,
<EOS>
So
and
So
,
and
let
me
take
and
give
'em
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
be
so
particular
as
that
,
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
Give
them
me
here
,
"
said
Clennam
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
come
across
the
road
,
"
answered
Maggy
in
a
very
loud
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Little
Mother
was
n't
to
know
nothing
of
it
,
and
she
would
never
have
known
nothing
of
it
if
you
had
only
gone
So
<EOS>
and
So
,
instead
of
bothering
and
loitering
about
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
my
fault
.
<EOS>
I
must
do
what
I
am
told
.
 
<EOS>
They
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
for
telling
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
crossed
to
the
other
side
,
and
hurriedly
opened
the
letters
.
 
<EOS>
That
from
the
father
mentioned
that
most
unexpectedly
finding
himself
in
the
novel
position
of
having
been
disappointed
of
a
remittance
from
the
City
on
which
he
had
confidently
counted
,
he
took
up
his
pen
,
being
restrained
by
the
unhappy
circumstance
of
his
incarceration
during
three
-
and
-
twenty
years
(
doubly
underlined
)
,
from
coming
himself
,
as
he
would
otherwise
certainly
have
done
---
took
up
his
pen
to
entreat
Mr
Clennam
to
advance
him
the
sum
of
Three
Pounds
Ten
Shillings
upon
his
IOU
,
which
he
begged
to
enclose
.
 
<EOS>
That
from
the
son
set
forth
that
Mr
Clennam
would
,
he
knew
,
be
gratified
to
hear
that
he
had
at
length
obtained
permanent
employment
of
a
highly
satisfactory
nature
,
accompanied
with
every
prospect
of
complete
success
in
life
;
but
that
the
temporary
inability
of
his
employer
to
pay
him
his
arrears
of
salary
to
that
date
(
in
which
condition
said
employer
had
appealed
to
that
generous
forbearance
in
which
he
trusted
he
should
never
be
wanting
towards
a
fellow
-
creature
)
,
combined
with
the
fraudulent
conduct
of
a
false
friend
and
the
present
high
price
of
provisions
,
had
reduced
him
to
the
verge
of
ruin
,
unless
he
could
by
a
quarter
before
six
<EOS>
that
evening
raise
the
sum
of
eight
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
This
sum
,
Mr
Clennam
would
be
happy
to
learn
,
he
had
,
through
the
promptitude
of
several
friends
who
had
a
lively
confidence
in
his
probity
,
already
raised
,
with
the
exception
of
a
trifling
balance
of
one
pound
seventeen
and
fourpence
;
the
loan
of
which
balance
,
for
the
period
of
one
month
,
would
be
fraught
with
the
usual
beneficent
consequences
.
   
<EOS>
These
letters
Clennam
answered
with
the
aid
of
his
pencil
and
pocket
-
book
,
on
the
spot
;
sending
the
father
what
he
asked
for
,
and
excusing
himself
from
compliance
with
the
demand
of
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
commissioned
Maggy
to
return
with
his
replies
,
and
gave
her
the
shilling
of
which
the
failure
of
her
supplemental
enterprise
would
have
disappointed
her
otherwise
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
rejoined
Little
Dorrit
,
and
they
had
begun
walking
as
before
,
she
said
all
at
once
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
had
better
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
better
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
distressed
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
I
have
answered
the
letters
.
<EOS>
They
were
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
afraid
,
"
she
returned
,
"
to
leave
him
,
I
am
afraid
to
leave
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
am
gone
,
they
pervert
---
<EOS>
but
they
do
n't
mean
it
---
even
Maggy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
very
innocent
commission
that
she
undertook
,
poor
thing
.
<EOS>
And
in
keeping
it
secret
from
you
,
she
supposed
,
no
doubt
,
that
she
was
only
saving
you
uneasiness
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
hope
so
,
I
hope
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
better
go
home
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
<EOS>
but
the
other
day
that
my
sister
told
me
I
had
become
so
used
to
the
prison
that
I
had
its
tone
and
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
must
be
when
I
see
these
things
.
 
<EOS>
My
place
is
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
better
there
.
 
<EOS>
it
is
unfeeling
in
me
to
be
here
,
when
I
can
do
the
least
thing
there
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
far
better
stay
at
home
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
agonised
way
in
which
she
poured
this
out
,
as
if
it
burst
of
itself
from
her
suppressed
heart
,
made
it
difficult
for
Clennam
to
keep
the
tears
from
his
eyes
as
he
saw
and
heard
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
call
it
home
,
my
child
!
"
<EOS>
he
entreated
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
always
painful
to
me
to
hear
you
call
it
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
home
!
 
<EOS>
What
else
can
I
call
home
?
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
ever
forget
it
for
a
single
moment
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
never
do
,
dear
Little
Dorrit
,
in
any
good
and
true
service
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
O
I
hope
not
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
better
for
me
to
stay
there
;
much
better
,
much
more
dutiful
,
much
happier
.
 
<EOS>
Please
do
n't
go
with
me
,
let
me
go
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
God
bless
you
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
felt
that
it
was
better
to
respect
her
entreaty
,
and
did
not
move
while
her
slight
form
went
quickly
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
had
fluttered
out
of
sight
,
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
water
and
stood
thinking
.
   
<EOS>
She
would
have
been
distressed
at
any
time
by
this
discovery
of
the
letters
;
but
so
much
so
,
and
in
that
unrestrainable
way
?
   
<EOS>
No
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
had
seen
her
father
begging
with
his
threadbare
disguise
on
,
when
she
had
entreated
him
not
to
give
her
father
money
,
she
had
been
distressed
,
but
not
like
this
.
 
<EOS>
Something
had
made
her
keenly
and
additionally
sensitive
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
was
there
some
one
in
the
hopeless
unattainable
distance
?
 
<EOS>
Or
had
the
suspicion
been
brought
into
his
mind
,
by
his
own
associations
of
the
troubled
river
running
beneath
the
bridge
with
the
same
river
<EOS>
higher
up
,
its
changeless
tune
upon
the
prow
of
the
ferry
-
boat
,
so
many
miles
an
hour
the
peaceful
flowing
of
the
stream
,
here
the
rushes
,
there
the
lilies
,
nothing
uncertain
or
unquiet
?
   
<EOS>
He
thought
of
his
poor
child
,
Little
Dorrit
,
for
a
long
time
there
;
he
thought
of
her
going
home
;
he
thought
of
her
in
the
night
;
he
thought
of
her
when
the
day
came
round
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
poor
child
Little
Dorrit
thought
of
him
---
<EOS>
too
faithfully
,
ah
,
too
faithfully
!
<EOS>
---
in
the
shadow
of
the
Marshalsea
wall

<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
bestirred
himself
with
such
prompt
activity
in
the
matter
of
the
negotiation
with
Daniel
Doyce
which
Clennam
had
entrusted
to
him
,
that
he
soon
brought
it
into
business
train
,
and
called
on
Clennam
at
nine
o'clock
one
morning
to
make
his
report
.
<EOS>
"
Doyce
is
highly
gratified
by
your
good
opinion
,
"
he
opened
the
business
by
saying
,
"
and
desires
nothing
so
much
as
that
you
should
examine
the

of

understand
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
handed
me
the
keys
of
all
his
books
and
papers
---
<EOS>
here
they
are
jingling
in
this
pocket
---
and
<EOS>
the
only
charge
he
has
given
me
is
"
Let
Mr
Clennam
have
the
means
of
putting
himself
on
a
perfect
equality
with
me
as
to
knowing
whatever
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
should
come
to
nothing
after
all
,
he
will
respect
my
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Unless
I
was
sure
of
that
to
begin
with
,
I
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
there
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
you
have
Daniel
Doyce
all
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
honourable
character
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
doubt
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Odd
,
but
very
honourable
.
 
<EOS>
Very
odd
though
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
would
you
believe
,
Clennam
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
with
a
hearty
enjoyment
of
his
friend
's
eccentricity
,
"
that
I
had
a
whole
morning
in
What's
-
his
-
name
Yard
---
"
   
"
Bleeding
Heart
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
whole
morning
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
before
I
could
induce
him
to
pursue
the
subject
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
How
was
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
was
that
,
my
friend
?
 
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
mentioned
your
name
in
connection
with
it
than
he
declared
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Declared
off
on
my
account
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
no
sooner
mentioned
your
name
,
Clennam
,
than
he
said
,
"
That
will
never
do
!
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
mean
by
that
?
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
,
Meagles
;
that
would
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
Why
would
it
never
do
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
hardly
believe
it
,
Clennam
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
laughing
within
himself
,
"
but
it
came
out
that
it
would
never
do
,
because
you
and
he
,
walking
down
to
Twickenham
together
,
had
glided
into
a
friendly
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
he
had
referred
to
his
intention
of
taking
a
partner
,
supposing
at
the
time
that
you
were
as
firmly
and
finally
settled
as
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whereas
,
"
says
he
,
"
Mr
Clennam
might
now
believe
,
if
I
entertained
his
proposition
,
that
I
had
a
sinister
and
designing
motive
in
what
was
open
free
speech
.
 
<EOS>
Which
I
ca
n't
bear
,
"
says
he
,
"
which
I
really
am
too
proud
to
bear
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
should
as
soon
suspect
---
"
   
"
Of
course
you
would
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Meagles
,
"
and
so
I
told
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
took
a
morning
to
scale
that
wall
;
and
I
doubt
if
any
other
man
than
myself
(
he
likes
me
of
old
)
could
have
got
his
leg
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
This
business
-
like
obstacle
surmounted
<EOS>
,
he
then
stipulated
that
before
resuming
with
you
I
should
look
over
the
books
and
form
my
own
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
over
the
books
,
and
formed
my
own
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
on
the
whole
,
for
,
or
against
?
"
says
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
,
"
says
I.
 
"
Then
,
"
says
he
,
"
you
may
now
,
my
good
friend
,
give
Mr
Clennam
the
means
of
forming
his
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
To
enable
him
to
do
which
,
without
bias
and
with
perfect
freedom
,
I
shall
go
out
of
town
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
's
gone
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
;
that
's
the
rich
conclusion
of
the
thing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Leaving
me
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
with
a
high
sense
<EOS>
,
I
must
say
,
of
his
candour
and
his
---
"
   
"
Oddity
,
"
Mr
Meagles
struck
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
exactly
the
word
on
Clennam
's
lips
,
but
he
forbore
to
interrupt
his
good
-
humoured
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
added
Mr
Meagles
,
"
you
can
begin
to
look
into
matters
as
soon
as
you
think
proper
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
undertaken
to
explain
where
you
may
want
explanation
,
but
to
be
strictly
impartial
,
and
to
do
nothing
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
began
their
perquisitions
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
that
same
forenoon
.
 
<EOS>
Little
peculiarities
were
easily
to
be
detected
by
experienced
eyes
in
Mr
Doyce
's
way
of
managing
his
affairs
,
but
they
almost
always
involved
some
ingenious
simplification
of
a
difficulty
,
and
some
plain
road
to
the
desired
end
.
 
<EOS>
That
his
papers
were
in
arrear
,
and
that
he
stood
in
need
of
assistance
to
develop
the
capacity
of
his
business
,
was
clear
enough
;
but
all
the
results
of
his
undertakings
during
many
years
were
distinctly
set
forth
,
and
were
ascertainable
with
ease
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
had
been
done
for
the
purposes
of
the
pending
investigation
;
everything
was
in
its
genuine
working
dress
,
and
in
a
certain
honest
rugged
order
.
 
<EOS>
The
calculations
and
entries
,
in
his
own
hand
,
of
which
there
were
many
,
were
bluntly
written
,
and
with
no
very
neat
precision
;
but
were
always
plain
and
directed
straight
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
Arthur
that
a
far
more
elaborate
and
taking
show
of
business
---
such
as
the
records
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
made
perhaps
---
might
be
far
less
serviceable
,
as
being
meant
to
be
far
less
intelligible
.
   
<EOS>
Three
or
four
days
of
steady
application
tendered
him
master
of
all
the
facts
it
was
essential
to
become
acquainted
with
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
was
at
hand
the
whole
time
,
always
ready
to
illuminate
any
dim
place
with
the
bright
little
safety
-
lamp
belonging
to
the
scales
and
scoop
.
 
<EOS>
Between
them
they
agreed
upon
the
sum
it
would
be
fair
to
offer
for
the
purchase
of
a
half
-
share
in
the
business
,
and
then
Mr
Meagles
unsealed
a
paper
in
which
Daniel
Doyce
had
noted
the
amount
at
which
he
valued
it
;
which
was
even
something
less
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
Daniel
came
back
,
he
found
the
affair
as
good
as
concluded
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
may
now
avow
,
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
he
,
with
a
cordial
shake
of
the
hand
,
"
that
if
I
had
looked
high
and
low
for
a
partner
,
I
believe
I
could
not
have
found
one
more
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
the
same
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
say
of
both
of
you
,
"
added
Mr
Meagles
,
"
that
you
are
well
matched
.
 
<EOS>
You
keep
him
in
check
,
Clennam
,
with
your
common
sense
,
and
you
stick
to
the
Works
,
Dan
,
with
your
---
"
   
"
Uncommon
sense
?
"
suggested
Daniel
,
with
his
quiet
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
call
it
so
,
if
you
like
---
and
each
of
you
will
be
a
right
hand
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
my
own
right
hand
upon
it
,
as
a
practical
man
,
to
both
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
purchase
was
completed
within
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
It
left
Arthur
in
possession
of
private
personal
means
not
exceeding
a
few
hundred
pounds
;
but
it
opened
to
him
an
active
and
promising
career
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
friends
dined
together
on
the
auspicious
occasion
;
the
factory
and
the
factory
wives
and
children
made
holiday
and
dined
too
;
even
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
dined
and
was
full
of
meat
.
 
<EOS>
Two
months
had
barely
gone
by
in
all
,
when
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
had
become
so
familiar
with
short
-
commons
again
,
that
the
treat
was
forgotten
there
;
when
nothing
seemed
new
in
the
partnership
but
the
paint
of
the
inscription
on
the
door
-
posts
,
DOYCE
AND
CLENNAM
;
when
it
appeared
even
to
Clennam
himself
,
that
he
had
had
the
affairs
of
the
firm
in
his
mind
for
years
.
   
<EOS>
The
little
counting
-
house
reserved
for
his
own
occupation
,
was
a
room
of
wood
and
glass
at
the
end
of
a
long
low
workshop
,
filled
with
benches
,
and
vices
,
and
tools
,
and
straps
,
and
wheels
;
which
,
when
they
were
in
gear
with
the
steam
-
engine
,
went
tearing
round
as
though
they
had
a
suicidal
mission
to
grind
the
business
to
dust
and
tear
the
factory
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
A
communication
of
great
trap
-
doors
in
the
floor
and
roof
with
the
workshop
above
and
the
workshop
below
,
made
a
shaft
of
light
in
this
perspective
,
which
brought
to
Clennam
's
mind
the
child
's
old
picture
-
book
,
where
similar
rays
were
the
witnesses
of
Abel
's
murder
.
 
<EOS>
The
noises
were
sufficiently
removed
and
shut
out
from
the
counting
-
house
to
blend
into
a
busy
hum
,
interspersed
with
periodical
clinks
and
thumps
.
<EOS>
The
patient
figures
at
work
were
swarthy
with
the
filings
of
iron
and
steel
that
danced
on
every
bench
and
bubbled
up
through
every
chink
in
the
planking
.
 
<EOS>
The
workshop
was
arrived
at
by
a
step
-
ladder
from
the
outer
yard
below
,
where
it
served
as
a
shelter
for
the
large
grindstone
where
tools
were
sharpened
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
had
at
once
a
fanciful
and
practical
air
in
Clennam
's
eyes
,
which
was
a
welcome
change
;
and
,
as
often
as
he
raised
them
from
his
first
work
of
getting
the
array
of
business
documents
into
perfect
order
,
he
glanced
at
these
things
with
a
feeling
of
pleasure
in
his
pursuit
that
was
new
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
Raising
his
eyes
thus
one
day
,
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
bonnet
labouring
up
the
step
-
ladder
.
 
<EOS>
The
unusual
apparition
was
followed
by
another
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
perceived
that
the
first
bonnet
was
on
the
head
of
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
and
that
the
second
bonnet
was
on
the
head
of
Flora
,
who
seemed
to
have
propelled
her
legacy
up
the
steep
ascent
with
considerable
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Though
not
altogether
enraptured
at
the
sight
of
these
visitors
,
Clennam
lost
no
time
in
opening
the
counting
-
house
door
,
and
extricating
them
from
the
workshop
;
a
rescue
which
was
rendered
the
more
necessary
by
Mr
F
's
Aunt
already
stumbling
over
some
impediment
,
and
menacing
steam
power
as
an
Institution
with
a
stony
reticule
she
carried
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Arthur
,
---
I
should
say
Mr
Clennam
,
far
more
proper
---
the
climb
we
have
had
to
get
up
here
<EOS>
and
how
ever
to
get
down
again
without
a
fire
-
escape
and
Mr
F
's
Aunt
slipping
through
the
steps
and
bruised
all
over
and
<EOS>
you
in
the
machinery
and
foundry
way
<EOS>
too
only
think
,
and
never
told
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
Flora
,
out
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mr
F
's
Aunt
rubbed
her
esteemed
insteps
with
her
umbrella
,
and
vindictively
glared
.
   
<EOS>
"
Most
unkind
never
to
have
come
back
to
see
us
since
that
day
,
though
naturally
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
there
should
be
any
attraction
at
our
house
<EOS>
and
you
were
much
more
pleasantly
engaged
<EOS>
,
that
's
pretty
certain
,
and
is
she
fair
or
dark
blue
eyes
or
black
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
<EOS>
not
that
I
expect
that
she
should
be
anything
but
a
perfect
contrast
to
me
in
all
particulars
for
I
am
a
disappointment
as
I
very
well
know
<EOS>
and
you
are
quite
right
to
be
devoted
no
doubt
though
<EOS>
what
I
am
saying
Arthur
never
mind
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
myself
Good
gracious
!
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
he
had
placed
chairs
for
them
in
the
counting
-
house
.
<EOS>
As
Flora
dropped
into
hers
,
she
bestowed
the
old
look
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
to
think
of
Doyce
and
Clennam
,
and
who
Doyce
can
be
,
"
said
Flora
;
<EOS>
"
delightful
man
no
doubt
and
married
perhaps
or
<EOS>
perhaps
a
daughter
<EOS>
,
now
has
he
really
?
 
<EOS>
then
one
understands
the
partnership
and
sees
it
all
,
do
n't
tell
me
anything
about
it
for
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
no
claim
to
ask
the
question
the
golden
chain
that
once
was
forged
being
snapped
and
very
proper
.
"
   
<EOS>
Flora
put
her
hand
tenderly
on
his
,
and
gave
him
another
of
the
youthful
glances
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Arthur
---
force
of
habit
,
Mr
Clennam
every
way
more
delicate
and
adapted
to
existing
circumstances
<EOS>
---
I
must
beg
to
be
excused
for
taking
the
liberty
of
this
intrusion
<EOS>
but
I
thought
I
might
so
far
presume
upon
old
times
for
ever
faded
never
more
to
bloom
as
to
call
with
Mr
F
's
Aunt
to
congratulate
and
offer
best
wishes
,
A
great
deal
superior
to
China
not
to
be
denied

much
nearer

higher
up
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
to
see
you
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
and
I
thank
you
,
Flora
,
very
much
for
your
kind
remembrance

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
More
than
I
can
say
myself
at
any
rate
,
"
returned
Flora
,
"
for
I
might
have
been
dead
and
buried
twenty
distinct
times
over
and
no
doubt
whatever
should
have
been
before
you
had
genuinely
remembered
Me
or
anything
like
it
in
spite
of
which
one
last
remark
I
wish
to
make
,
one
last
explanation
I
wish
to
offer
---
"
   
"
My
dear
Mrs
Finching
,
"
Arthur
remonstrated
in
alarm
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
not
that
disagreeable
name
,
say
Flora
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Flora
,
is
it
worth
troubling
yourself
afresh
to
enter
into
explanations
?
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
none
are
needed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
---
I
am
perfectly
satisfied

"
   
<EOS>
A
diversion
was
occasioned
here
,
by
Mr
F
's
Aunt
making
the
following
inexorable
and
awful
statement
:
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
mile
-
stones
on
the
Dover
road
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
such
mortal
hostility
towards
the
human
race
did
she
discharge
this
missile
,
that
Clennam
was
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
defend
himself
;
the
rather
as
he
had
been
already
perplexed
in
his
mind
by
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
this
venerable
lady
,
when
it
was
plain
she
held
him
in
the
utmost
abhorrence
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
look
at
her
with
disconcertment
,
as
she
sat
breathing
bitterness
and
scorn
,
and
staring
leagues
away
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
,
however
,
received
the
remark
as
if
it
had
been
of
a
most
apposite
and
agreeable
nature
;
approvingly
observing
aloud
that
Mr
F
's
Aunt
had
a
great
deal
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
Stimulated
either
by
this
compliment
,
or
by
her
burning
indignation
,
that
illustrious
woman
then
added
,
"
Let
him
meet
it
if
he
can
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
with
a
rigid
movement
of
her
stony
reticule
(
an
appendage
of
great
size
and
of
a
fossil
appearance
)
,
indicated
that
Clennam
was
the
unfortunate
person
at
whom
the
challenge
was
hurled
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
last
remark
,
"
resumed
Flora
,
"
I
was
going
to
say
I
wish
to
make
one
last
explanation
I
wish
to
offer
,
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
and
myself
would
not
have
intruded
on
business
hours
Mr
F
having
been
in
business
and
though
the
wine
trade
still
business
is
equally
business
call
it
<EOS>
what
you
will
and
business
habits
are
just
the
same
as
witness
Mr
F
himself
who
had
his
slippers
always
on
the
mat
at
ten
minutes
before
six
in
the
afternoon
and
his
boots
inside
the
fender
at
ten
minutes
before
eight
in
the
morning
to
the
moment
in
all
weathers
light
or
dark
---
would
not
therefore
have
intruded
without
a
motive
which
being
kindly
meant
it
may
be
hoped
will
be
kindly
taken
Arthur
,
Mr
Clennam
far
more
proper
,
even
Doyce
and
Clennam
probably
more
business
-
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
say
nothing
in
the
way
of
apology
,
"
Arthur
entreated
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
always
welcome
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
polite
of
you
to
say
so
Arthur
---
can
not
remember
Mr
Clennam
until
the
word
is
out
,
such
is
the
habit
of
times
for
ever
fled
,
and
so
true
it
is
that
oft
in
the
stilly
night
<EOS>
ere
slumber
's
chain
has
bound
people
,
fond
memory
brings
the
light
of
other
days
around
people
---
very
polite
but
more
polite
than
true
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
,
for
to
go
into
the
machinery
business
without
so
much
as
sending
a
line
or
a
card
to
papa
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
say
me
though
there
was
a
time
<EOS>
but
that
is
past
and
stern
reality
has
now
my
gracious
never
mind
---
does
not
look
like
it
<EOS>
you
must
confess
.
"
   
<EOS>
Even
Flora
's
commas
seemed
to
have
fled
on
this
occasion
;
she
was
so
much
more
disjointed
and
voluble
than
in
the
preceding
interview
.
   
<EOS>
"
Though
indeed
,
"
she
hurried
on
,
"
nothing
else
is
to
be
expected
and
why
should
it
be
expected
and
if
it
's
not
to
be
expected
why
should
it
be
,
and
I
am
far
from
blaming
you
or
any
one
,
When
your
mama
and
my
papa
worried
us
to
death
and
severed
the
golden
bowl
---
<EOS>
I
mean
bond
<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
you
know
what
I
mean
<EOS>
and
if
you
do
n't
you
do
n't
lose
much
and
care
<EOS>
just
as
little
I
will
venture
to
add
---
when
they
severed
the
golden
bond
that
bound
us
and
threw
us
into
fits
of
crying
on
the
sofa
nearly
choked
at
least
myself
everything
was
changed
and
in
giving
my
hand
to
Mr
F
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
did
so
with
my
eyes
open
<EOS>
but
he
was
so
very
unsettled
and
in
such
low
spirits
that
he
had
distractedly
alluded
to
the
river
if
not
oil
of
something
from
the
chemist
's
<EOS>
and
I
did
it
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
Flora
,
we
settled
that
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
quite
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
perfectly
clear
you
think
so
,
"
returned
Flora
,
"
<EOS>
for
you
take
it
very
coolly
,
if
I
had
n't
known
it
to
be
China
<EOS>
I
should
have
guessed
myself
the
Polar
regions
<EOS>
,
dear
Mr
Clennam
you
are
right
however
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
blame
you
<EOS>
but
as
to
Doyce
and
Clennam
papa
's
property
being
about
here
we
heard
it
from
Pancks
and
<EOS>
but
for
him
we
never
should
have
heard
one
word
about
it
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
no
,
do
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
not
to
say
it
Arthur
---
<EOS>
Doyce
and
Clennam
---
easier
and
less
trying
to
me
than
Mr
Clennam
---
<EOS>
when
I
know
it
<EOS>
and
you
know
it
too
and
ca
n't
deny
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
deny
it
,
Flora
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
soon
have
made
you
a
friendly
visit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Flora
,
tossing
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
!
<EOS>
"
and
she
gave
him
another
of
the
old
looks
.
 
<EOS>
"
However
when
Pancks
told
us
I
made
up
my
mind
that
Mr
F
's
Aunt
and
I
would
come
and
call
because
when
papa
---
which
was
before
that
---
happened
to
mention
her
name
to
me
and
to
say
that
you
were
interested
in
her
<EOS>
I
said
at
the
moment
Good
gracious
why
not
have
her
here
then
when
there
's
anything
to
do
instead
of
putting
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
say
Her
,
"
observed
Clennam
,
by
this
time
pretty
well
bewildered
,
"
do
you
mean
Mr
F
's
---
"
   
"
My
goodness
,
Arthur
---
Doyce
and
Clennam
really
easier
to
me
with
old
remembrances
---
who
ever
heard
of
Mr
F
's
Aunt
doing
needlework
and
going
out
by
the
day
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
out
by
the
day
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
speak
of
Little
Dorrit
?
"
<EOS>
"
Why
yes
of
course
,
"
returned
Flora
;
"
and
of
all
the
strangest
names
I
ever
heard
the
strangest
,
like
a
place
down
in
the
country
with
a
turnpike
,
or
a
favourite
pony
or
a
puppy
or
a
bird
or
something
from
a
seed
-
shop
to
be
put
in
a
garden
or
a
flower
-
pot
and
come
up
speckled
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Flora
,
"
said
Arthur
,
with
a
sudden
interest
in
the
conversation
,
"
Mr
Casby
was
so
kind
as
to
mention
Little
Dorrit
to
you
,
was
he
?
 
<EOS>
What
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
you
know
what
papa
is
,
"
rejoined
Flora
,
"
and
how
aggravatingly
he
sits
looking
beautiful
and
turning
his
thumbs
over
and
over
one
another
till
he
makes
one
giddy
if
one
keeps
one
's
eyes
upon
him
,
he
said
when
we
were
talking
of
you
---
I
do
n't
know
who
began
the
subject
Arthur
(
Doyce
and
Clennam
)
<EOS>
but
I
am
sure
it
was
n't
me
,
<EOS>
at
least
I
hope
not
<EOS>
but
you
really
must
excuse
my
confessing
more
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
ready
,
"
pouted
Flora
,
coming
to
a
sudden
stop
in
a
captivating
bashfulness
,
"
that
I
must
admit
,
Papa
said
you
had
spoken
of
her
in
an
earnest
way
<EOS>
and
I
said
what
I
have
told
you
and
that
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
?
"
said
Arthur
,
a
little
disappointed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Except
that
when
Pancks
told
us
of
your
having
embarked
in
this
business
and
with
difficulty
persuaded
us
that
it
was
really
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
I
said
to
Mr
F
's
Aunt
then
we
would
come
and
ask
you
if
it
would
be
agreeable
to
all
parties
that
she
should
be
engaged
at
our
house
when
required
for
<EOS>
I
know
she
often
goes
to
your
mama
's
<EOS>
and
I
know
that
your
mama
has
a
very
touchy
temper
Arthur
---
Doyce
and
Clennam
---
<EOS>
or
I
never
might
have
married
Mr
F
and
might
have
been
at
this
hour
<EOS>
but
I
am
running
into
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
kind
of
you
,
Flora
,
to
think
of
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Flora
rejoined
with
a
plain
sincerity
which
became
her
better
than
her
youngest
glances
,
that
she
was
glad
he
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
it
with
so
much
heart
that
Clennam
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
buy
his
old
character
of
her
on
the
spot
,
and
throw
it
and
the
mermaid
away
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Flora
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
the
employment
you
can
give
Little
Dorrit
,
and
the
kindness
you
can
show
her
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Yes
and
I
will
,
"
said
Flora
,
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
---
will
be
a
great
assistance
and
support
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
that
I
have
the
right
to
tell
you
what
I
know
of
her
,
for
I
acquired
the
knowledge
confidentially
,
and
under
circumstances
that
bind
me
to
silence
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
an
interest
in
the
little
creature
,
and
a
respect
for
her
that
I
can
not
express
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Her
life
has
been
one
of
such
trial
and
devotion
,
and
such
quiet
goodness
,
as
you
can
scarcely
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
think
of
her
,
far
less
speak
of
her
,
without
feeling
moved
.
 
<EOS>
Let
that
feeling
represent
what
I
could
tell
you
,
and
commit
her
to
your
friendliness
with
my
thanks
.
"
   
<EOS>
Once
more
he
put
out
his
hand
frankly
to
poor
Flora
;
once
more
poor
Flora
could
n't
accept
it
frankly
,
found
it
worth
nothing
openly
,
must
make
the
old
intrigue
and
mystery
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
much
to
her
own
enjoyment
as
to
his
dismay
,
she
covered
it
with
a
corner
of
her
shawl
as
she
took
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
looking
towards
the
glass
front
of
the
counting
-
house
,
and
seeing
two
figures
approaching
,
she
cried
with
infinite
relish
,
"
Papa
!
 
<EOS>
Hush
,
Arthur
,
for
Mercy
's
sake
!
"
and
tottered
back
to
her
chair
with
an
amazing
imitation
of
being
in
danger
of
swooning
,
in
the
dread
surprise
and
maidenly
flutter
of
her
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
The
Patriarch
,
meanwhile
,
came
inanely
beaming
towards
the
counting
-
house
in
the
wake
of
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
Pancks
opened
the
door
for
him
,
towed
him
in
,
and
retired
to
his
own
moorings
in
a
corner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
heard
from
Flora
,
"
said
the
Patriarch
with
his
benevolent
smile
,
"
that
she
was
coming
to
call
,
coming
to
call
.
 
<EOS>
And
being
out
,
I
thought
I
'd
come
also
<EOS>
,
thought
I
'd
come
also
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
benign
wisdom
he
infused
into
this
declaration
(
not
of
itself
profound
)
,
by
means
of
his
blue
eyes
,
his
shining
head
,
and
his
long
white
hair
,
was
most
impressive
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
worth
putting
down
among
the
noblest
sentiments
enunciated
by
the
best
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
when
he
said
to
Clennam
,
seating
himself
in
the
proffered
chair
,
"
And
you
are
in
a
new
business
,
Mr
Clennam
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
well
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
wish
you
well
!
"
<EOS>
he
seemed
to
have
done
benevolent
wonders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Finching
has
been
telling
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Arthur
,
after
making
his
acknowledgments
;
the
relict
of
the
late
Mr
F
meanwhile
protesting
,
with
a
gesture
,
against
his
use
of
that
respectable
name
;
"
that
she
hopes
occasionally
to
employ
the
young
needlewoman
you
recommended
to
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
I
have
been
thanking
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Patriarch
turning
his
head
in
a
lumbering
way
towards
Pancks
,
that
assistant
put
up
the
note
-
book
in
which
he
had
been
absorbed
,
and
took
him
in
tow
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
recommend
her
,
you
know
,
"
said
Pancks
;
"
how
could
you
?
<EOS>
You
knew
nothing
about
her
,
you
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
was
mentioned
to
you
,
and
you
passed
it
on
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
YOU
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
she
justifies
any
recommendation
,
it
is
much
the
same
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
glad
she
turns
out
well
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
but
it
would
n't
have
been
your
fault
if
she
had
turned
out
ill
.
 
<EOS>
The
credit
's
not
yours
as
it
is
,
and
the
blame
would
n't
have
been
yours
as
it
might
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
You
gave
no
guarantee
.
 
<EOS>
You
knew
nothing
about
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
acquainted
,
then
,
"
said
Arthur
,
hazarding
a
random
question
,
"
with
any
of
her
family
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Acquainted
with
any
of
her
family
?
"
returned
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
should
you
be
acquainted
with
any
of
her
family
?
 
<EOS>
You
never
heard
of
'em
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
be
acquainted
with
people
you
never
heard
of
,
can
you
?
<EOS>
You
should
think
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
Patriarch
sat
serenely
smiling
;
nodding
or
shaking
his
head
benevolently
,
as
the
case
required
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
being
a
reference
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
you
know
,
in
a
general
way
,
what
being
a
reference
means
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
your
eye
,
that
is
!
<EOS>
Look
at
your
tenants
down
the
Yard
here
.
 
<EOS>
They
'd
all
be
references
for
one
another
,
if
you
'd
let
'em
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
be
the
good
of
letting
'em
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
satisfaction
to
be
done
by
two
men
instead
of
one
.
 
<EOS>
One
's
enough
.
 
<EOS>
A
person
who
ca
n't
pay
,
gets
another
person
who
ca
n't
pay
,
to
guarantee
that
he
can
pay
.
 
<EOS>
Like
a
person
with
two
wooden
legs
getting
another
person
with
two
wooden
legs
,
to
guarantee
that
he
has
got
two
natural
legs
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
n't
make
either
of
them
able
to
do
a
walking
match
.
 
<EOS>
And
four
wooden
legs
are
more
troublesome
to
you
than
two
,
when
you
do
n't
want
any
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
concluded
by
blowing
off
that
steam
of
his
.
   
<EOS>
A
momentary
silence
that
ensued
was
broken
by
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
who
had
been
sitting
upright
in
a
cataleptic
state
since
her
last
public
remark
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
underwent
a
violent
twitch
,
calculated
to
produce
a
startling
effect
on
the
nerves
of
the
uninitiated
,
and
with
the
deadliest
animosity
observed
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
make
a
head
and
brains
out
of
a
brass
knob
with
nothing
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
n't
do
it
when
your
Uncle
George
was
living
;
much
less
when
he
's
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
was
not
slow
to
reply
,
with
his
usual
calmness
,
"
Indeed
,
ma'am
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
surprised
to
hear
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Despite
his
presence
of
mind
,
however
,
the
speech
of
Mr
F
's
Aunt
produced
a
depressing
effect
on
the
little
assembly
;
firstly
,
because
it
was
impossible
to
disguise
that
Clennam
's
unoffending
head
was
the
particular
temple
of
reason
depreciated
;
and
secondly
,
because
nobody
ever
knew
on
these
occasions
whose
Uncle
George
was
referred
to
,
or
what
spectral
presence
might
be
invoked
under
that
appellation
.
   
<EOS>
Therefore
Flora
said
,
though
still
not
without
a
certain
boastfulness
and
triumph
in
her
legacy
,
that
Mr
F
's
Aunt
was
"
very
lively
to
-
day
,
and
she
thought
they
had
better
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
F
's
Aunt
proved
so
lively
as
to
take
the
suggestion
in
unexpected
dudgeon
and
declare
that
she
would
not
go
;
adding
,
with
several
injurious
expressions
,
that
if
"
He
"
---
too
evidently
meaning
Clennam
---
wanted
to
get
rid
of
her
,
"
let
him
chuck
her
out
of
winder
;
"
and
urgently
expressing
her
desire
to
see
"
Him
"
perform
that
ceremony
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
,
Mr
Pancks
,
whose
resources
appeared
equal
to
any
emergency
in
the
Patriarchal
waters
,
slipped
on
his
hat
,
slipped
out
at
the
counting
-
house
door
,
and
slipped
in
again
a
moment
afterwards
with
an
artificial
freshness
upon
him
,
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
country
for
some
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
my
heart
,
ma'am
!
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
rubbing
up
his
hair
in
great
astonishment
,
"
is
that
you
?
   
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
looking
charming
to
-
day
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Favour
me
with
your
arm
,
ma'am
;
we
'll
have
a
little
walk
together
,
you
and
me
,
if
you
'll
honour
me
with
your
company
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
escorted
Mr
F
's
Aunt
down
the
private
staircase
of
the
counting
-
house
with
great
gallantry
and
success
.
 
<EOS>
The
patriarchal
Mr
Casby
then
rose
with
the
air
of
having
done
it
himself
,
and
blandly
followed
:
leaving
his
daughter
,
as
she
followed
in
her
turn
,
to
remark
to
her
former
lover
in
a
distracted
whisper
(
which
she
very
much
enjoyed
)
,
that
they
had
drained
the
cup
of
life
to
the
dregs
;
and
further
to
hint
mysteriously
that
the
late
Mr
F
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Alone
again
,
Clennam
became
a
prey
to
his
old
doubts
in
reference
to
his
mother
and
Little
Dorrit
,
and
revolved
the
old
thoughts
and
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
in
his
mind
,
blending
themselves
with
the
duties
he
was
mechanically
discharging
,
when
a
shadow
on
his
papers
caused
him
to
look
up
for
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
The
cause
was
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
With
his
hat
thrown
back
upon
his
ears
as
if
his
wiry
prongs
of
hair
had
darted
up
like
springs
and
cast
it
off
,
with
his
jet
-
black
beads
of
eyes
inquisitively
sharp
,
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
in
his
mouth
that
he
might
bite
the
nails
,
and
with
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
in
reserve
in
his
pocket
for
another
course
,
Mr
Pancks
cast
his
shadow
through
the
glass
upon
the
books
and
papers
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
asked
,
with
a
little
inquiring
twist
of
his
head
,
if
he
might
come
in
again
?
 
<EOS>
Clennam
replied
with
a
nod
of
his
head
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
worked
his
way
in
,
came
alongside
the
desk
,
made
himself
fast
by
leaning
his
arms
upon
it
,
and
started
conversation
with
a
puff
and
a
snort
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
F
's
Aunt
is
appeased
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
sir
,
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
awakened
a
strong
animosity
in
the
breast
of
that
lady
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
SHE
know
why
?
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
suppose
not
,
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
out
his
note
-
book
,
opened
it
,
shut
it
,
dropped
it
into
his
hat
,
which
was
beside
him
on
the
desk
,
and
looked
in
at
it
as
it
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
hat
:
all
with
a
great
appearance
of
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
"
he
then
began
,
"
I
am
in
want
of
information
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Connected
with
this
firm
?
"
asked
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
what
then
,
Mr
Pancks
?
 
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
assuming
that
you
want
it
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
yes
,
I
want
it
of
you

said
Pancks
,
"

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
blew
off
his
peculiar
noise
again
,
and
fell
to
at
his
right
-
hand
nails
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
looked
searchingly
at
him
;
he
returned
the
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
Mr
Pancks
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
name
that
I
want
to
know
about
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
want
to
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
can
and
will
tell
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
comprehensive
summary
of
his
desires
was
not
discharged
without
some
heavy
labouring
on
the
part
of
Mr
Pancks
's
machinery
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
singular
visit
,
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
It
strikes
me
as
rather
extraordinary
that
you
should
come
,
with
such
an
object
,
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
all
extraordinary
together
,
"
returned
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
out
of
the
ordinary
course
,
and
yet
be
business
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
it
is
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
What
business
have
I
in
this
present
world
,
except
to
stick
to
business
?
 
<EOS>
No
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
his
former
doubt
whether
this
dry
hard
personage
were
quite
in
earnest
,
Clennam
again
turned
his
eyes
attentively
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
scrubby
and
dingy
as
ever
,
and
as
eager
and
quick
as
ever
,
and
he
could
see
nothing
lurking
in
it
that
was
at
all
expressive
of
a
latent
mockery
that
had
seemed
to
strike
upon
his
ear
in
the
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
to
put
this
business
on
its
own
footing
,
it
's
not
my
proprietor
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
refer
to
Mr
Casby
as
your
proprietor
?
"
   
<EOS>
Pancks
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
proprietor

<EOS>
Put
a
case
.
 
<EOS>
Say
,
at
my
proprietor
's
I

name
---
name

Clennam
wants

<EOS>
Say

name

mentioned

Plornish

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

"
   
<EOS>
"
Well

returned
Pancks
,
"

I

<EOS>
Say

here
I
am

"
   
<EOS>
With
those
prongs
of
hair
sticking
up
all
over
his
head
,
and
his
breath
coming
and
going
very
hard
and
short
,
the
busy
Pancks
fell
back
a
step
(
in
Tug
metaphor
,
took
half
a
turn
astern
)
as
if
to
show
his
dingy
hull
complete
,
then
forged
a
-
head
again
,
and
directed
his
quick
glance
by
turns
into
his
hat
where
his
note
-
book
was
,
and
into
Clennam
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pancks
,
not
to
trespass
on
your
grounds
of
mystery
,
I
will
be
as
plain
with
you
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
ask
two
questions
.
 
<EOS>
First
---
"
   
"
All
right
!
"
said
Pancks
,
holding
up
his
dirty
forefinger
with
his
broken
nail
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
!
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
motive
?
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Exactly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Motive
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
good
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
to
do
with
my
proprietor
;
not
stateable
at
present
,
ridiculous
to
state
at
present
;
but
good
.
   
<EOS>
Desiring
to
serve
young
person
,
name
of
Dorrit
,
"
said
Pancks
,
with
his
forefinger
still
up
as
a
caution
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
admit
motive
to
be
good
.
"
   
"
Secondly
,
and
lastly
,
what
do
you
want
to
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
fished
up
his
note
-
book
before
the
question
was
put
,
and
buttoning
it
with
care
in
an
inner
breast
-
pocket
,
and
looking
straight
at
Clennam
all
the
time
,
replied
with
a
pause
and
a
puff
,
"
I
want
supplementary
information
of
any
sort
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
could
not
withhold
a
smile
,
as
the
panting
little
steam
-
tug
,
so
useful
to
that
unwieldy
ship
,
the
Casby
,
waited
on
and
watched
him
as
if
it
were
seeking
an
opportunity
of
running
in
and
rifling
him
of
all
he
wanted
before
he
could
resist
its
manoeuvres
;
though
there
was
that
in
Mr
Pancks
's
eagerness
,
too
,
which
awakened
many
wondering
speculations
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
consideration
,
he
resolved
to
supply
Mr
Pancks
with
such
leading
information
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
impart
him
;
<EOS>
well
knowing
that
Mr
Pancks
,
if
he
failed
in
his
present
research
,
was
pretty
sure
to
find
other
means
of
getting
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
first
requesting
Mr
Pancks
to
remember
his
voluntary
declaration
that
his
proprietor
had
no
part
in
the
disclosure
,
and
that
his
own
intentions
were
good
(
two
declarations
which
that
coaly
little
gentleman
with
the
greatest
ardour
repeated
)
,
openly
told
him
that
as
to
the
Dorrit
lineage
or
former
place
of
habitation
,
he
had
no
information
to
communicate
,
and
that
his
knowledge
of
the
family
did
not
extend
beyond
the
fact
that
it
appeared
to
be
now
reduced
to
five
members
;
namely
,
to
two
brothers
,
of
whom
one
was
single
,
and
one
a
widower
with
three
children
.
 
<EOS>
The
ages
of
the
whole
family
he
made
known
to
Mr
Pancks
,
as
nearly
as
he
could
guess
at
them
;
and
finally
he
described
to
him
the
position
of
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
and
the
course
of
time
and
events
through
which
he
had
become
invested
with
that
character
.
 
<EOS>
To
all
this
,
Mr
Pancks
,
snorting
and
blowing
in
a
more
and
more
portentous
manner
as
he
became
more
interested
,
listened
with
great
attention
;
appearing
to
derive
the
most
agreeable
sensations
from
the
painfullest
parts
of
the
narrative
,
and
particularly
to
be
quite
charmed
by
the
account
of
William
Dorrit
's
long
imprisonment
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
conclusion
,
Mr
Pancks
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
I
have
but
to
say
this
.
<EOS>
I
have
reasons
beyond
a
personal
regard
for
speaking
as
little
as
I
can
of
the
Dorrit
family
,
particularly
at
my
mother
's
house
"
(
Mr
Pancks
nodded
)
,
"
and
for
knowing
as
much
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
So
devoted
a
man
of
business
as
you
are
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
For
Mr
Pancks
had
suddenly
made
that
blowing
effort
with
unusual
force
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
,
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
devoted
a
man
of
business
as
yourself
has
a
perfect
understanding
of
a
fair
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
make
a
fair
bargain
with
you
,
that
you
shall
enlighten
me
concerning
the
Dorrit
family
when
you
have
it
in
your
power
,
as
I
have
enlightened
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
not
give
you
a
very
flattering
idea
of
my
business
habits
,
that
I
failed
to
make
my
terms
beforehand
,
"
continued
Clennam
;
"
but
I
prefer
to
make
them
a
point
of
honour
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
so
much
business
done
on
sharp
principles
that
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Mr
Pancks
,
I
am
tired
of
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
bargain
,
sir
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
find
me
stick
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
stood
a
little
while
looking
at
Clennam
,
and
biting
his
ten
nails
all
round
;
evidently
while
he
fixed
in
his
mind
what
he
had
been
told
,
and
went
over
it
carefully
,
before
the
means
of
supplying
a
gap
in
his
memory
should
be
no
longer
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
"
and
now
I
'll
wish
you
good
day
,
as
it
's
collecting
day
in
the
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
A
lame
foreigner
with
a
stick
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
take
a
reference
sometimes
,
I
see
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
he
can
pay
,
sir
,
"
replied
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
all
you
can
get
,
and
keep
back
all
you
ca
n't
be
forced
to
give
up
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
business
.
<EOS>
The
lame
foreigner
with
the
stick
wants
a
top
room
down
the
Yard
.
<EOS>
Is
he
good
for
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
and
I
will
answer
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
enough
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
must
have
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
"
said
Pancks
,
making
a
note
of
the
case
in
his
book
,
"
is
my
bond
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
my
bond
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
Pay
up
,
or
produce
your
property
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
watchword
down
the
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
The
lame
foreigner
with
the
stick
represented
that
you
sent
him
;
but
he
could
represent
(
as
far
as
that
goes
)
that
the
Great
Mogul
sent
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
in
the
hospital
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Through
having
met
with
an
accident
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
only
just
now
discharged
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
pauperising
a
man
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
have
been
shown
,
to
let
him
into
a
hospital
?
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
And
again
blew
off
that
remarkable
sound
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
shown
so
too
,
"
said
Clennam
,
coldly
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
being
by
that
time
quite
ready
for
a
start
,
got
under
steam
in
a
moment
,
and
,
without
any
other
signal
or
ceremony
,
was
snorting
down
the
step
-
ladder
and
working
into
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
before
he
seemed
to
be
well
out
of
the
counting
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
Throughout
the
remainder
of
the
day
,
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
was
in
consternation
,
as
the
grim
Pancks
cruised
in
it
;
haranguing
the
inhabitants
on
their
backslidings
in
respect
of
payment
,
demanding
his
bond
,
breathing
notices
to
quit
and
executions
,
running
down
defaulters
,
sending
a
swell
of
terror
on
before
him
,
and
leaving
it
in
his
wake
.
 
<EOS>
Knots
of
people
,
impelled
by
a
fatal
attraction
,
lurked
outside
any
house
in
which
he
was
known
to
be
,
listening
for
fragments
of
his
discourses
to
the
inmates
;
and
,
when
he
was
rumoured
to
be
coming
down
the
stairs
,
often
could
not
disperse
so
quickly
but
that
he
would
be
prematurely
in
among
them
,
demanding
their
own
arrears
,
and
rooting
them
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Throughout
the
remainder
of
the
day
,
Mr
Pancks
's
What
were
they
up
to
?
 
<EOS>
and
What
did
they
mean
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
sounded
all
over
the
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
would
n't
hear
of
excuses
,
would
n't
hear
of
complaints
,
would
n't
hear
of
repairs
,
would
n't
hear
of
anything
but
unconditional
money
down
.
 
<EOS>
Perspiring
and
puffing
and
darting
about
in
eccentric
directions
,
and
becoming
hotter
and
dingier
every
moment
,
he
lashed
the
tide
of
the
yard
into
a
most
agitated
and
turbid
state
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
not
settled
down
into
calm
water
again
full
two
hours
after
he
had
been
seen
fuming
away
on
the
horizon
at
the
top
of
the
steps
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
several
small
assemblages
of
the
Bleeding
Hearts
at
the
popular
points
of
meeting
in
the
Yard
that
night
,
among
whom
it
was
universally
agreed
that
Mr
Pancks
was
a
hard
man
to
have
to
do
with
;
and
that
it
was
much
to
be
regretted
,
so
it
was
,
that
a
gentleman
like
Mr
Casby
should
put
his
rents
in
his
hands
,
and
never
know
him
in
his
true
light
.
 
<EOS>
For
(
said
the
Bleeding
Hearts
)
,
if
a
gentleman
with
that
head
of
hair
and
them
eyes
took
his
rents
into
his
own
hands
,
ma'am
,
there
would
be
none
of
this
worriting
and
wearing
,
and
things
would
be
very
different
.
   
<EOS>
At
which
identical
evening
hour
and
minute
,
the
Patriarch
---
who
had
floated
serenely
through
the
Yard
in
the
forenoon
before
the
harrying
began
,
with
the
express
design
of
getting
up
this
trustfulness
in
his
shining
bumps
and
silken
locks
---
at
which
identical
hour
and
minute
,
that
first
-
rate
humbug
of
a
thousand
guns
was
heavily
floundering
in
the
little
Dock
of
his
exhausted
Tug
at
home
,
and
was
saying
,
as
he
turned
his
thumbs
:
   
"
A
very
bad
day
's
work
,
Pancks
,
very
bad
day
's
work
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
,
sir
,
and
I
must
insist
on
making
this
observation
forcibly
in
justice
to
myself
,
that
you
ought
to
have
got
much
more
money
,
much
more
money

Fortune

Telling
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
received
a
call
that
same
evening
from
Mr
Plornish
,
who
,
having
intimated
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
privately
,
in
a
series
of
coughs
so
very
noticeable
as
to
favour
the
idea
that
her
father
,
as
regarded
her
seamstress
occupation
,
was
an
illustration
of
the
axiom
that
there
are
no
such
stone
-
blind
men
as
those
who
will
not
see
,
obtained
an
audience
with
her
on
the
common
staircase
outside
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
been
a
lady
at
our
place
to
-
day
,
Miss
Dorrit
,
"
Plornish
growled
,
"
and
another
one
along
with
her
as
is
a
old
wixen
<EOS>
if
ever
I
met
with
such
.
 
<EOS>
The
way
she
snapped
a
person
's
head
off
,
dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
mild
Plornish
was
at
first
quite
unable
to
get
his
mind
away
from
Mr
F
's
Aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
,
"
said
he
,
to
excuse
himself
,
"
she
is
,
I
do
assure
you
,
the
winegariest
party
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
by
a
great
effort
,
he
detached
himself
from
the
subject
sufficiently
to
observe
:
   
<EOS>
"
But
she
's
neither
here
nor
there
just
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
lady
,
she
's
Mr
Casby
's
daughter
;
and
if
Mr
Casby
an't
well
off
,
none
better
,
it
an't
through
any
fault
of
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
as
to
Pancks
,
he
does
,
he
really
does
,
he
does
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Plornish
,
after
his
usual
manner
,
was
a
little
obscure
,
but
conscientiously
emphatic
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
she
come
to
our
place
for
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
was
to
leave
word
that
if
Miss
Dorrit
would
step
up
to
that
card
---
which
it
's
Mr
Casby
's
house
that
is
,
and
Pancks
he
has
a
office
at
the
back
,
where
he
really
does
,
<EOS>
beyond
belief
---
she
would
be
glad
for
to
engage
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
old
and
a
dear
friend
<EOS>
,
she
said
particular
,
of
Mr
Clennam
,
and
hoped
for
to
prove
herself
a
useful
friend
to
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Them
was
her
words
.
 
<EOS>
Wishing
to
know
whether
Miss
Dorrit
could
come
to
-
morrow
morning
<EOS>
,
I
said
I
would
see
you
,
Miss
,
and
inquire
,
and
look
round
there
to
-
night
,
to
say
yes
,
or
,
if
you
was
engaged
to
-
morrow
,
when
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
go
to
-
morrow
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
kind
of
you
,
but
you
are
always
kind
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Plornish
,
with
a
modest
disavowal
of
his
merits
,
opened
the
room
door
for
her
readmission
,
and
followed
her
in
with
such
an
exceedingly
bald
pretence
of
not
having
been
out
at
all
,
that
her
father
might
have
observed
it
without
being
very
suspicious
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
affable
unconsciousness
,
however
,
he
took
no
heed
.
 
<EOS>
Plornish
,
after
a
little
conversation
,
in
which
he
blended
his
former
duty
as
a
Collegian
with
his
present
privilege
as
a
humble
outside
friend
,
qualified
again
by
his
low
estate
as
a
plasterer
,
took
his
leave
;
making
the
tour
of
the
prison
before
he
left
,
and
looking
on
at
a
game
of
skittles
with
the
mixed
feelings
of
an
old
inhabitant
who
had
his
private
reasons
for
believing
that
it
might
be
his
destiny
to
come
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
,
Little
Dorrit
,
leaving
Maggy
in
high
domestic
trust
,
set
off
for
the
Patriarchal
tent
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
by
the
Iron
Bridge
,
though
it
cost
her
a
penny
,
and
walked
more
slowly
in
that
part
of
her
journey
than
in
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
At
five
minutes
before
eight
her
hand
was
on
the
Patriarchal
knocker
,
which
was
quite
as
high
as
she
could
reach
.
   
<EOS>
She
gave
Mrs
Finching
's
card
to
the
young
woman
who
opened
the
door
,
and
the
young
woman
told
her
that
"
Miss
Flora
"
---
<EOS>
Flora
having
,
on
her
return
to
the
parental
roof
,
reinvested
herself
with
the
title
under
which
she
had
lived
there
---
was
not
yet
out
of
her
bedroom
,
but
she
was
to
please
to
walk
up
into
Miss
Flora
's
sitting
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
walked
up
into
Miss
Flora
's
sitting
-
room
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
and
there
found
a
breakfast
-
table
comfortably
laid
for
two
,
with
a
supplementary
tray
upon
it
laid
for
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
woman
,
disappearing
for
a
few
moments
,
returned
to
say
that
she
was
to
please
to
take
a
chair
by
the
fire
,
and
to
take
off
her
bonnet
and
make
herself
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
But
Little
Dorrit
,
being
bashful
,
and
not
used
to
make
herself
at
home
on
such
occasions
,
felt
at
a
loss
how
to
do
it
;
so
she
was
still
sitting
near
the
door
with
her
bonnet
on
,
when
Flora
came
in
in
a
hurry
half
an
hour
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
Flora
was
so
sorry
to
have
kept
her
waiting
,
and
good
gracious
why
did
she
sit
out
there
in
the
cold
when
she
had
expected
to
find
her
by
the
fire
reading
the
paper
,
and
had
n't
that
heedless
girl
given
her
the
message
then
,
and
had
she
really
been
in
her
bonnet
all
this
time
,
and
pray
for
goodness
sake
<EOS>
let
Flora
take
it
off
!
 
<EOS>
Flora
taking
it
off
in
the
best
-
natured
manner
in
the
world
,
was
so
struck
with
the
face
disclosed
,
that
she
said
,
"
Why
,
what
a
good
little
thing
you
are
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
and
pressed
her
face
between
her
hands
like
the
gentlest
of
women
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
word
and
the
action
of
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
had
hardly
time
to
think
how
kind
it
was
,
when
Flora
dashed
at
the
breakfast
-
table
full
of
business
,
and
plunged
over
head
and
ears
into
loquacity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
so
sorry
that
I
should
happen
to
be
late
on
this
morning
of
all
mornings
because
my
intention
and
my
wish
was
to
be
ready
to
meet
you
when
you
came
in
and
to
say
that
any
one
that
interested
Arthur
Clennam
half
so
much
must
interest
me
and
that
I
gave
you
the
heartiest
welcome
and
was
so
glad
,
<EOS>
instead
of
which
they
never
called
me
<EOS>
and
there
I
still
am
snoring
<EOS>
I
dare
say
if
the
truth
was
known
and
if
you
do
n't
like
either
cold
fowl
or
hot
boiled
ham
which
many
people
do
n't
<EOS>
I
dare
say
besides
Jews
and
theirs
<EOS>
are
scruples
of
conscience
which
we
must
all
respect
though
I
must
say
I
wish
they
had
them
equally
strong
when
they
sell
us
false
articles
for
real
<EOS>
that
certainly
ai
n't
worth
the
money
I
shall
be
quite
vexed
,
"
said
Flora
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
thanked
her
,
and
said
,
shyly
,
bread
-
and
-
butter
and
tea
was
all
she
usually
---
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
nonsense
my
dear
child
I
can
never
hear
of
that
,
"
said
Flora
,
turning
on
the
urn
in
the
most
reckless
manner
,
and
making
herself
wink
by
splashing
hot
water
into
her
eyes
as
she
bent
down
to
look
into
the
teapot
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
coming
here
on
the
footing
of
a
friend
and
companion
you
know
if
you
will
let
me
take
that
liberty
<EOS>
and
I
should
be
ashamed
of
myself
indeed
if
you
could
come
here
upon
any
other
,
besides
which
Arthur
Clennam
spoke
in
such
terms
<EOS>
---
you
are
tired
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
turn
so
pale
you
have
walked
too
far
before
breakfast
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
<EOS>
live
a
great
way
off
and
ought
to
have
had
a
ride
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
<EOS>
dear
dear
is
there
anything
that
would
do
you
good
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
quite
well

I
thank
you
again
and
again

I
am
quite
well

"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
take
your
tea
at
once
I
beg
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
and
this
wing
of
fowl
and
bit
of
ham
,
do
n't
mind
me
or
wait
for

I
always
carry
in
this
tray
myself

who
breakfasts
in
bed
and
a
charming
old
lady
too
and
very
clever
,
Portrait
of
Mr
F
behind
the
door
and
very
like
though
too
much
forehead
and
as
to
a
pillar
with
a
marble
pavement
and
balustrades
and
a
mountain
<EOS>
,
I
never
saw
him
near
it
nor
not
likely
in
the
wine
trade
,
excellent
man
but
not
at
all
in
that
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
glanced
at
the
portrait
,
very
imperfectly
following
the
references
to
that
work
of
art
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
F
was
so
devoted
to
me
that
he
never
could
bear
me
out
of
his
sight
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
though
of
course
I
am
unable
to
say
how
long
that
might
have
lasted
if
he
had
n't
been
cut
short
while
I
was
a
new
broom
,
worthy
man
but
not
poetical
manly
prose
but
not
romance
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
glanced
at
the
portrait
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
artist
had
given
it
a
head
that
would
have
been
,
in
an
intellectual
point
of
view
,
top
-
heavy
for
Shakespeare
.
<EOS>
"
Romance
,
however
,
"
Flora
went
on
,
busily
arranging
Mr
F
's
Aunt
's
toast
,
"
as
I
openly
said
to
Mr
F
when
he
proposed
to
me
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
he
proposed
seven
times
once
in
a
hackney
-
coach
once
in
a
boat
once
in
a
pew
once
on
a
donkey
at
Tunbridge
Wells
and
the
rest
on
his
knees
,
Romance
was
fled
with
the
early
days
of
Arthur
Clennam
,
our
parents
tore
us
asunder
we
became
marble
and
stern
reality
usurped
the
throne
,
Mr
F
said
very
much
to
his
credit
that
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
it
and
even
preferred
that
state
of
things
accordingly
the
word
was
spoken
the
fiat
went
forth
and
<EOS>
such
is
life
you
see
my
dear
<EOS>
and
yet
we
do
not
break
but
bend
,
pray
<EOS>
make
a
good
breakfast
while
I
go
in
with
the
tray
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
disappeared
,
leaving
Little
Dorrit
to
ponder
over
the
meaning
of
her
scattered
words
.
 
<EOS>
She
soon
came
back
again
;
and
at
last
began
to
take
her
own
breakfast
,
talking
all
the
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Flora
,
measuring
out
a
spoonful
or
two
of
some
brown
liquid
that
smelt
like
brandy
,
and
putting
it
into
her
tea
,
"
I
am
obliged
to
be
careful
to
follow
the
directions
of
my
medical
man
though
the
flavour
is
anything
but
agreeable
being
a
poor
creature
<EOS>
and
it
may
be
have
never
recovered
the
shock
received
in
youth
from
too
much
giving
way
to
crying
in
the
next
room
when
separated
from
Arthur
<EOS>
,
have
you
known
him
long
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Little
Dorrit
comprehended
that
she
had
been
asked
this
question
---
for
which
time
was
necessary
,
the
galloping
pace
of
her
new
patroness
having
left
her
far
behind
---
she
answered
that
she
had
known
Mr
Clennam
ever
since
his
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
you
could
n't
have
known
him
before
unless
you
had
been
in
China
or
had
corresponded
neither
of
which
is
likely
,
"
returned
Flora
,
"
for
travelling
-
people
usually
get
more
or
less
mahogany
and
you
are
not
at
all
so
and
as
to
corresponding
what
about
?
 
<EOS>
that
's
very
true
unless
tea
,
so
it
was
at
his
mother
's
<EOS>
was
it
really
that
you
knew
him
first
,
highly
sensible
and
firm
but
dreadfully
severe
<EOS>
---
ought
to
be
the
mother
of
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Clennam
has
been
kind
to
me
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
because
as
Arthur
's
mother
it
's
naturally
pleasant
to
my
feelings
to
have
a
better
opinion
of
her
than
I
had
before
,
though
what
she
thinks
of
me
when
I
run
on
as
I
am
certain
to
do
<EOS>
and
she
sits
glowering
at
me
like
Fate
in
a
go
-
cart
<EOS>
---
shocking
comparison
really
---
invalid
and
not
her
fault
<EOS>
---
I
never
know
or
can
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
find
my
work
anywhere
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
Little
Dorrit
,
looking
timidly
about
;
"
can
I
get
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
industrious
little
fairy
<EOS>
,
"
returned
Flora
,
taking
,
in
another
cup
of
tea
,
another
of
the
doses
prescribed
by
her
medical
man
,
"
there
's
not
the
slightest
hurry
<EOS>
and
it
's
better
that
we
should
begin
by
being
confidential
about
our
mutual
friend
---
too
cold
a
word
for
me
<EOS>
at
least
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
very
proper
expression
mutual
friend
---
than
become
through
mere
formalities
not
you
but
me
like
the
Spartan
boy
with
the
fox
biting
him
,
<EOS>
which
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
my
bringing
up
for
of
all
the
tiresome
boys
that
will
go
tumbling
into
every
sort
of
company
that
boy
's
the
tiresomest
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
her
face
very
pale
,
sat
down
again
to
listen
.
"
<EOS>
Had
n't
I
better
work
the
while
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
work
and
attend
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
,
if
I
may
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
earnestness
was
so
expressive
of
her
being
uneasy
without
her
work
,
that
Flora
answered
,
"
Well
my
dear
<EOS>
whatever
you
like
best
,
"
and
produced
a
basket
of
white
handkerchiefs
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
gladly
put
it
by
her
side
,
took
out
her
little
pocket
-
housewife
,
threaded
the
needle
,
and
began
to
hem
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
nimble
fingers
you
have
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
but
are
you
sure
you
are
well
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
Flora
put
her
feet
upon
the
fender
,
and
settled
herself
for
a
thorough
good
romantic
disclosure
.
 
<EOS>
She
started
off
at
score
,
tossing
her
head
,
sighing
in
the
most
demonstrative
manner
,
making
a
great
deal
of
use
of
her
eyebrows
,
and
occasionally
,
but
not
often
,
glancing
at
the
quiet
face
that
bent
over
the
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
my
dear
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
but
that
I
have
no
doubt
you
know
already
not
only
because
I
have
already
thrown
it
out
in
a
general
way
<EOS>
but
because
I
feel
I
carry
it
stamped
in
burning
what
's
his
names
upon
my
brow
that
before
I
was
introduced
to
the
late
Mr
F.
I
had
been
engaged
to
Arthur
Clennam
---
Mr
Clennam
in
public
where
reserve
is
necessary
Arthur
here
<EOS>
---
we
were
all
in
all
to
one
another
it
was
the
morning
of
life
<EOS>
it
was
bliss
<EOS>
it
was
frenzy
<EOS>
it
was
everything
else
of
that
sort
in
the
highest
degree
,
when
rent
asunder
we
turned
to
stone
in
which
capacity
Arthur
went
to
China
<EOS>
and
I
became
the
statue
bride
of
the
late
Mr
F.
"
   
Flora
,
uttering
these
words
in
a
deep
voice
,
enjoyed
herself
immensely
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
paint
,
"
said
she
,
"
the
emotions
of
that
morning
when
all
was
marble
within
and
Mr
F
's
Aunt
followed
in
a
glass
-
coach
which
it
stands
to
reason
must
have
been
in
shameful
repair
or
it
never
could
have
broken
down
two
streets
from
the
house
and
Mr
F
's
Aunt
brought
home
like
the
fifth
of
November
in
a
rush
-
bottomed
chair
I
will
not
attempt
,
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
hollow
form
of
breakfast
took
place
in
the
dining
-
room
downstairs
<EOS>
that
papa
partaking
too
freely
of
pickled
salmon
was
ill
for
weeks
and
that
Mr
F
and
myself
went
upon
a
continental
tour
to
Calais
where
the
people
fought
for
us
on
the
pier
until
they
separated
us
though
not
for
ever
that
was
not
yet
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
statue
bride
,
hardly
pausing
for
breath
,
went
on
,
with
the
greatest
complacency
,
in
a
rambling
manner
sometimes
incidental
to
flesh
and
blood
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
draw
a
veil
over
that
dreamy
life
,
Mr
F
was
in
good
spirits
<EOS>
his
appetite
was
good
<EOS>
he
liked
the
cookery
he
considered
the
wine
weak
but
palatable
and
all
was
well
<EOS>
,
we
returned
to
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
Number
Thirty
Little
Gosling
Street
London
Docks
and
settled
down
,
ere
we
had
yet
fully
detected
the
housemaid
in
selling
the
feathers
out
of
the
spare
bed
Gout
flying
upwards
soared
with
Mr
F
to
another
sphere
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
relict
,
with
a
glance
at
his
portrait
,
shook
her
head
and
wiped
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
revere
the
memory
of
Mr
F
as
an
estimable
man
and
most
indulgent
husband
,
only
necessary
to
mention
Asparagus
<EOS>
and
it
appeared
or
to
hint
at
any
little
delicate
thing
to
drink
<EOS>
and
it
came
like
magic
in
a
pint
bottle
<EOS>
it
was
not
ecstasy
<EOS>
but
it
was
comfort
<EOS>
,
I
returned
to
papa
's
roof
and
lived
secluded
if
not
happy
during
some
years
until
one
day
papa
came
smoothly
blundering
in
and
said
that
Arthur
Clennam
awaited
me
below
,
I
went
below
and
found
him
ask
me
not
what
I
found
him
except
that
he
was
still
unmarried
still
unchanged
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
dark
mystery
with
which
Flora
now
enshrouded
herself
might
have
stopped
other
fingers
than
the
nimble
fingers
that
worked
near
her
.
   
<EOS>
They
worked
on
without
pause
,
and
the
busy
head
bent
over
them
watching
the
stitches
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
me
not
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
if
I
love
him
still
or
if
he
still
loves
me
or
what
the
end
is
to
be
or
when

we
are
surrounded
by
watchful
eyes
and
it
may
be
that
we
are
destined
to
pine
asunder
it
may
be
never
more
to
be
reunited
not
a
word
not
a
breath
not
a
look
to
betray
us
all
must
be
secret
as
the

not
therefore
that
even
if
I
should
seem
comparatively
cold
to
Arthur
or
Arthur
should
seem
comparatively
cold
to
me
<EOS>
we
have
fatal
reasons
<EOS>
it
is
enough
if
we
understand
them
hush
!
"
   
<EOS>
All
of
which
Flora
said
with
so
much
headlong
vehemence
as
if
she
really
believed
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
not
much
doubt
that
when
she
worked
herself
into
full
mermaid
condition
,
she
did
actually
believe
whatever
she
said
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Flora
<EOS>
,
"
I
have
now
told
you
all
,
confidence
is
established
between
us
hush
,
for
Arthur
's
sake
<EOS>
I
will
always
be
a
friend
to
you
my
dear
girl
and
in
Arthur
's
name
you
may
always
rely
upon
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
nimble
fingers
laid
aside
the
work
,
and
the
little
figure
rose
and
kissed
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
cold
,
"
said
Flora
,
changing
to
her
own
natural
kind
-
hearted
manner
,
and
gaining
greatly
by
the
change
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
work
to

day
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
are
not
well
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
are
not
strong

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
that
I
feel
a
little
overcome
by
your
kindness
,
and
by
Mr
Clennam
's
kindness
in
confiding
me
to
one
he
has
known
and
loved
so
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
really
my
dear
,
"
said
Flora
,
who
had
a
decided
tendency
to
be
always
honest
when
she
gave
herself
time
to
think
about
it
,
"
it
's
as
well
to
leave
that
alone
now
,
for
I
could
n't
undertake
to
say
after
all
,
but
it
does
n't
signify
lie
down
a
little
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
been
strong
enough
to
do
what
I
want
to
do
,
and
I
shall
be
quite
well
directly
,
"
returned
Little
Dorrit
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
overpowered
me
with
gratitude
,
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
keep
near
the
window
for
a
moment
I
shall
be
quite
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Flora
opened
a
window
,
sat
her
in
a
chair
by
it
,
and
considerately
retired
to
her
former
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
windy
day
,
and
the
air
stirring
on
Little
Dorrit
's
face
soon
brightened
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
very
few
minutes
she
returned
to
her
basket
of
work
,
and
her
nimble
fingers
were
as
nimble
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
Quietly
pursuing
her
task
,
she
asked
Flora
if
Mr
Clennam
had
told
her
where
she
lived
?
 
<EOS>
When
Flora
replied
in
the
negative
,
Little
Dorrit
said
that
she
understood
why
he
had
been
so
delicate
,
but
that
she
felt
sure
he
would
approve
of
her
confiding
her
secret
to
Flora
,
and
that
she
would
therefore
do
so
now
with
Flora
's
permission
.
 
<EOS>
Receiving
an
encouraging
answer
,
she
condensed
the
narrative
of
her
life
into
a
few
scanty
words
about
herself
and
a
glowing
eulogy
upon
her
father
;
and
Flora
took
it
all
in
with
a
natural
tenderness
that
quite
understood
it
,
and
in
which
there
was
no
incoherence
.
   
<EOS>
When
dinner
-
time
came
,
Flora
drew
the
arm
of
her
new
charge
through
hers
,
and
led
her
down
-
stairs
,
and
presented
her
to
the
Patriarch
and
Mr
Pancks
,
who
were
already
in
the
dining
-
room
waiting
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
(
Mr
F
's
Aunt
was
,
for
the
time
,
laid
up
in
ordinary
in
her
chamber
.
)
<EOS>
By
those
gentlemen
she
was
received
according
to
their
characters
;
the
Patriarch
appearing
to
do
her
some
inestimable
service
in
saying
that
he
was
glad
to
see
her
,
glad
to
see
her
;
and
Mr
Pancks
blowing
off
his
favourite
sound
as
a
salute
.
   
<EOS>
In
that
new
presence
she
would
have
been
bashful
enough
under
any
circumstances
,
and
particularly
under
Flora
's
insisting
on
her
drinking
a
glass
of
wine
and
eating
of
the
best
that
was
there
;
but
her
constraint
was
greatly
increased
by
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
The
demeanour
of
that
gentleman
at
first
suggested
to
her
mind
that
he
might
be
a
taker
of
likenesses
,
so
intently
did
he
look
at
her
,
and
so
frequently
did
he
glance
at
the
little
note
-
book
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Observing
that
he
made
no
sketch
,
however
,
and
that
he
talked
about
business
only
,
she
began
to
have
suspicions
that
he
represented
some
creditor
of
her
father
's
,
the
balance
due
to
whom
was
noted
in
that
pocket
volume
.
 
<EOS>
Regarded
from
this
point
of
view
Mr
Pancks
's
puffings
expressed
injury
and
impatience
,
and
each
of
his
louder
snorts
became
a
demand
for
payment
.
   
<EOS>
But
here
again
she
was
undeceived
by
anomalous
and
incongruous
conduct
on
the
part
of
Mr
Pancks
himself
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
left
the
table
half
an
hour
,
and
was
at
work
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
had
"
gone
to
lie
down
"
in
the
next
room
,
concurrently
with
which
retirement
a
smell
of
something
to
drink
had
broken
out
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
Patriarch
was
fast
asleep
,
with
his
philanthropic
mouth
open
under
a
yellow
pocket
-
handkerchief
in
the
dining
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
quiet
time
,
Mr
Pancks
softly
appeared
before
her
,
urbanely
nodding
.
   
<EOS>
"
Find
it
a
little
dull
,
Miss
Dorrit
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Pancks
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Busy
,
I
see
,
"
observed
Mr
Pancks
,
stealing
into
the
room
by
inches
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
those
now
,
Miss
Dorrit
?
"
   
"
Handkerchiefs
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
,
though
!
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
have
thought
it
.
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
looking
at
them
,
but
looking
at
Little
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
wonder
who
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
fortune
-
teller
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
now
began
to
think
he
was
mad
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
belong
body
and
soul
to
my
proprietor
,
"
said
Pancks
;
"
you
saw
my
proprietor
having
his
dinner
below
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
a
little
in
the
other
way
,
sometimes
;
privately
,
very
privately
,
Miss
Dorrit
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
looked
at
him
doubtfully
,
and
not
without
alarm
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
show
me
the
palm
of
your
hand
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
have
a
look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
be
troublesome
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
so
far
troublesome
that
he
was
not
at
all
wanted
there
,
but
she
laid
her
work
in
her
lap
for
a
moment
,
and
held
out
her
left
hand
with
her
thimble
on
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Years
of
toil
,
eh
?
"
said
Pancks
,
softly
,
touching
it
with
his
blunt
forefinger
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
else
are
we
made
for
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
Hallo
!
"
<EOS>
looking
into
the
lines
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
with
bars
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
College
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
's
this
with
a
grey
gown
and
a
black
velvet
cap
?
<EOS>
it
's
a
father
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
's
this
with
a
clarionet
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
an
uncle
!
<EOS>
And
what
's
this
in
dancing
-
shoes
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
sister
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
's
this
straggling
about
in
an
idle
sort
of
a
way
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
brother
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
's
this
thinking
for
'em
all
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
this
is
you
,
Miss
Dorrit
!
"
<EOS>
Her
eyes
met
his
as
she
looked
up
wonderingly
into
his
face
,
and
she
thought
that
although
his
were
sharp
eyes
,
he
was
a
brighter
and
gentler
-
looking
man
than
she
had
supposed
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
on
her
hand
again
directly
,
and
her
opportunity
of
confirming
or
correcting
the
impression
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
the
deuce
is
in
it
,
"
muttered
Pancks
,
tracing
out
a
line
in
her
hand
with
his
clumsy
finger
,
"
if
this
is
n't
me
in
the
corner
here
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
want
here
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
behind
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
carried
his
finger
slowly
down
to
the
wrist
,
and
round
the
wrist
,
and
affected
to
look
at
the
back
of
the
hand
for
what
was
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
any
harm
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Little
Dorrit
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Deuce
a
bit
!
"
<EOS>
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
it
's
worth
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
ask
you
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
fortune
-
teller
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
it
worth
?
 
<EOS>
You
shall
live
to
see
,
Miss
Dorrit
.
"
   
<EOS>
Releasing
the
hand
by
slow
degrees
,
he
drew
all
his
fingers
through
his
prongs
of
hair
,
so
that
they
stood
up
in
their
most
portentous
manner
;
and
repeated
slowly
,
"
Remember
what
I
say
,
Miss
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
You
shall
live
to
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
showing
that
she
was
much
surprised
,
if
it
were
only
by
his
knowing
so
much
about
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
Pancks
,
pointing
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dorrit
,
not
that
,
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
More
surprised
than
before
,
and
a
little
more
frightened
,
she
looked
to
him
for
an
explanation
of
his
last
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
,
"
said
Pancks
,
making
,
with
great
seriousness
,
an
imitation
of
a
surprised
look
and
manner
that
appeared
to
be
unintentionally
grotesque
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
Never
on
seeing
me
,
no
matter
when
,
no
matter
where
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
take
on
to
mind
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mention
me
.
 
<EOS>
Take
no
notice
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
agree
,
Miss
Dorrit
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
what
to
say
,
"
returned
Little
Dorrit
,
quite
astounded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
I
am
a
fortune
-
teller
.
 
<EOS>
Pancks
the
gipsy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
told
you
so
much
of
your
fortune
yet
,
Miss
Dorrit
,
as
to
tell
you
what
's
behind
me
on
that
little
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
you
shall
live
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
agreed
,
Miss
Dorrit
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Agreed
that
I
---
am
---
to
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
To
take
no
notice
of
me
away
from
here
,
unless
I
take
on
first
.
<EOS>
Not
to
mind
me
when
I
come
and
go
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
easy
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
no
loss
<EOS>
,
I
am
not
handsome
,
I
am
not
good
company
,
I
am
only
my
proprietors
grubber
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
do
no
more
than
think
,
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Pancks
the
gipsy
at
his
fortune
-
telling
<EOS>
---
he
'll
tell
the
rest
of
my
fortune
one
day
---
I
shall
live
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Is
it
agreed
,
Miss
Dorrit
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ye
-
es
,
"
faltered
Little
Dorrit
,
whom
he
greatly
confused
<EOS>
,
"
I
suppose
so
,
while
you
do
no
harm
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
glanced
at
the
wall
of
the
adjoining
room
,
and
stooped
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Honest
creature
,
woman
of
capital
points
,
but
heedless
and
a
loose
talker
,
Miss
Dorrit
.
"
 
With
that
he
rubbed
his
hands
as
if
the
interview
had
been
very
satisfactory
to
him
,
panted
away
to
the
door
,
and
urbanely
nodded
himself
out
again
.
   
<EOS>
If
Little
Dorrit
were
beyond
measure
perplexed
by
this
curious
conduct
on
the
part
of
her
new
acquaintance
,
and
by
finding
herself
involved
in
this
singular
treaty
,
her
perplexity
was
not
diminished
by
ensuing
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
that
Mr
Pancks
took
every
opportunity
afforded
him
in
Mr
Casby
's
house
of
significantly
glancing
at
her
and
snorting
at
her
---
which
was
not
much
,
after
what
he
had
done
already
---
he
began
to
pervade
her
daily
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
him
in
the
street
,
constantly
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
went
to
Mr
Casby
's
,
he
was
always
there
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
went
to
Mrs
Clennam
's
,
he
came
there
on
any
pretence
,
as
if
to
keep
her
in
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
A
week
had
not
gone
by
,
when
she
found
him
to
her
astonishment
in
the
Lodge
one
night
,
conversing
with
the
turnkey
on
duty
,
and
to
all
appearance
one
of
his
familiar
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Her
next
surprise
was
to
find
him
equally
at
his
ease
within
the
prison
;
to
hear
of
his
presenting
himself
among
the
visitors
at
her
father
's
Sunday
levee
;
to
see
him
arm
in
arm
with
a
Collegiate
friend
about
the
yard
;
to
learn
,
from
Fame
,
that
he
had
greatly
distinguished
himself
one
evening
at
the
social
club
that
held
its
meetings
in
the
Snuggery
,
by
addressing
a
speech
to
the
members
of
the
institution
,
singing
a
song
,
and
treating
the
company
to
five
gallons
of
ale
---
report
madly
added
a
bushel
of
shrimps
.
 
<EOS>
The
effect
on
Mr
Plornish
of
such
of
these
phenomena
as
he
became
an
eye
-
witness
of
in
his
faithful
visits
,
made
an
impression
on
Little
Dorrit
only
second
to
that
produced
by
the
phenomena
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
gag
and
bind
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
only
stare
,
and
sometimes
weakly
mutter
that
it
would
n't
be
believed
down
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
that
this
was
Pancks
;
but
he
never
said
a
word
more
,
or
made
a
sign
more
,
even
to
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
crowned
his
mysteries
by
making
himself
acquainted
with
Tip
in
some
unknown
manner
,
and
taking
a
Sunday
saunter
into
the
College
on
that
gentleman
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Throughout
he
never
took
any
notice
of
Little
Dorrit
,
save
once
or
twice
when
he
happened
to
come
close
to
her
<EOS>
and
there
was
no
one
very
near
;
<EOS>
on
which
occasions
,
he
said
in
passing
,
with
a
friendly
look
and
a
puff
of
encouragement
,
"
Pancks
the
gipsy
---
fortune
-
telling
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
worked
and
strove
as
usual
,
wondering
at
all
this
,
but
keeping
her
wonder
,
as
she
had
from
her
earliest
years
kept
many
heavier
loads
,
in
her
own
breast
.
 
<EOS>
A
change
had
stolen
,
and
was
stealing
yet
,
over
the
patient
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
found
her
something
more
retiring
than
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
To
pass
in
and
out
of
the
prison
unnoticed
,
and
elsewhere
to
be
overlooked
and
forgotten
,
were
,
for
herself
,
her
chief
desires
.
   
<EOS>
To
her
own
room
too
,
strangely
assorted
room
for
her
delicate
youth
and
character
,
she
was
glad
to
retreat
as
often
as
she
could
without
desertion
of
any
duty
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
afternoon
times
when
she
was
unemployed
,
when
visitors
dropped
in
to
play
a
hand
at
cards
with
her
father
,
when
she
could
be
spared
and
was
better
away
.
<EOS>
Then
she
would
flit
along
the
yard
,
climb
the
scores
of
stairs
that
led
to
her
room
,
and
take
her
seat
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Many
combinations
did
those
spikes
upon
the
wall
assume
,
many
light
shapes
did
the
strong
iron
weave
itself
into
<EOS>
,
many
golden
touches
fell
upon
the
rust
,
while
Little
Dorrit
sat
there
musing
.
 
<EOS>
New
zigzags
sprung
into
the
cruel
pattern
sometimes
,
when
she
saw
it
through
a
burst
of
tears
;
but
beautified
or
hardened
still
,
always
over
it
and
under
it
and
through
it
,
she
was
fain
to
look
in
her
solitude
,
seeing
everything
with
that
ineffaceable
brand
.
   
<EOS>
A
garret
,
and
a
Marshalsea
garret
without
compromise
,
was
Little
Dorrit
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
Beautifully
kept
,
it
was
ugly
in
itself
,
and
had
little
but
cleanliness
and
air
to
set
it
off
;
for
what
embellishment
she
had
ever
been
able
to
buy
,
had
gone
to
her
father
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
for
this
poor
place
she
showed
an
increasing
love
;
and
to
sit
in
it
alone
became
her
favourite
rest
.
   
<EOS>
Insomuch
,
that
on
a
certain
afternoon
during
the
Pancks
mysteries
,
when
she
was
seated
at
her
window
,
and
heard
Maggy
's
well
-
known
step
coming
up
the
stairs
,
she
was
very
much
disturbed
by
the
apprehension
of
being
summoned
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
Maggy
's
step
came
higher
up
and
nearer
,
she
trembled
and
faltered
;
and
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
speak
,
when
Maggy
at
length
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
Please
,
Little
Mother
,
"
said
Maggy
,
panting
for
breath
,
"
you
must
come
down
and
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
,
Maggy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
,
o
'
course
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
in
your
father
's
room
,
and
he
says
to
me
,
Maggy
,
will
you
be
so
kind
and
go
and
say
it
's
only
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
very
well
,
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
better
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
lie
down
.
 
<EOS>
See
!
 
<EOS>
I
lie
down
now
,
to
ease
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
Say
,
with
my
grateful
regard
,
that
you
left
me
so
,
or
I
would
have
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
an't
very
polite
though
,
Little
Mother
,
"
said
the
staring
Maggy
,
"
to
turn
your
face
away
,
neither
!
"
   
<EOS>
Maggy
was
very
susceptible
to
personal
slights
,
and
very
ingenious
in
inventing
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Putting
both
your
hands
afore
your
face
too
!
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
ca
n't
bear
the
looks
of
a
poor
thing
,
it
would
be
better
to
tell
her
<EOS>
so
at
once
,
and
not
go
and
shut
her
out
like
that
,
hurting
her
feelings
and
breaking
her
heart
at
ten
year
old
,
poor
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
to
ease
my
head
,
Maggy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
if
you
cry
to
ease
your
head
,
Little
Mother
,
let
me
cry
too
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
and
have
all
the
crying
to
yourself
,
"
expostulated
Maggy
,
"
that
an't
not
being
greedy
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
immediately
began
to
blubber
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
with
some
difficulty
that
she
could
be
induced
to
go
back
with
the
excuse
;
but
the
promise
of
being
told
a
story
---
of
old
her
great
delight
---
on
condition
that
she
concentrated
her
faculties
upon
the
errand
and
left
her
little
mistress
to
herself
for
an
hour
longer
,
combined
with
a
misgiving
on
Maggy
's
part
that
she
had
left
her
good
temper
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
So
away
she
went
,
muttering
her
message
all
the
way
to
keep
it
in
her
mind
,
and
,
<EOS>
at
the
appointed
time
,
came
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
very
sorry
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
she
announced
,
"
and
wanted
to
send
a
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
's
coming
again
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
he
is
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
think
he
'll
have
a
good
sleep
to
-
night
along
o
'
hearing
about
your
head
,
Little
Mother
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
my
!
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
been
a
-
crying
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
,
a
little
,
Maggy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
all
over
now
---
all
over
for
good
,
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
head
is
much
better
and
cooler
,
and
I
am
quite
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
I
did
not
go
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
great
staring
child
tenderly
embraced
her
;
and
having
smoothed
her
hair
,
and
bathed
her
forehead
and
eyes
with
cold
water
(
offices
in
which
her
awkward
hands
became
skilful
)
,
hugged
her
again
,
exulted
in
her
brighter
looks
,
and
stationed
her
in
her
chair
by
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Over
against
this
chair
,
Maggy
,
with
apoplectic
exertions
that
were
not
at
all
required
,
dragged
the
box
which
was
her
seat
on
story
-
telling
occasions
,
sat
down
upon
it
,
hugged
her
own
knees
,
and
said
,
with
a
voracious
appetite
for
stories
,
and
with
widely
-
opened
eyes
:
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Little
Mother
,
let
's
have
a
good
'
un
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
shall
it
be
about
,
Maggy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
's
have
a
princess
,
"
said
Maggy
,
"
and
let
her
be
a
reg'lar
one
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
all
belief
,
you
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
considered
for
a
moment
;
and
with
a
rather
sad
smile
upon
her
face
,
which
was
flushed
by
the
sunset
,
began
:
   
"
Maggy
,
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
fine
King
,
and
he
had
everything
he
could
wish
for
,
and
a
great
deal
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gold
and
silver
,
diamonds
and
rubies
,
riches
of
every
kind
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
palaces
,
and
he
had
---
"
   
"
Hospitals
,
"
interposed
Maggy
,
still
nursing
her
knees
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
have
hospitals
,
because
they
're
so
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Hospitals
with
lots
of
Chicking
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
had
plenty
of
them
,
and
he
had
plenty
of
everything
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Plenty
of
baked
potatoes
,
for
instance
?
"
said
Maggy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Plenty
of
everything
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
"
chuckled
Maggy
,
giving
her
knees
a
hug
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
it
prime
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
King
had
a
daughter
,
who
was
the
wisest
and
most
beautiful
Princess
that
ever
was
seen
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
was
a
child
she
understood
all
her
lessons
before
her
masters
taught
them
to
her
;
and
when
she
was
grown
up
,
she
was
the
wonder
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
near
the
Palace
where
this
Princess
lived
,
there
was
a
cottage
in
which
there
was
a
poor
little
tiny
woman
,
who
lived
all
alone
by
herself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
An
old
woman
,
"
said
Maggy
,
with
an
unctuous
smack
of
her
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
an
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
a
young
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
she
warn't
afraid
,
"
said
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Princess
passed
the
cottage
nearly
every
day
,
and
whenever
she
went
by
in
her
beautiful
carriage
,
she
saw
the
poor
tiny
woman
spinning
at
her
wheel
,
and
she
looked
at
the
tiny
woman
,
and
the
tiny
woman
looked
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
one
day
she
stopped
the
coachman
a
little
way
from
the
cottage
,
and
got
out
and
walked
on
and
peeped
in
at
the
door
,
and
there
,
as
usual
,
was
the
tiny
woman
spinning
at
her
wheel
,
and
she
looked
at
the
Princess
,
and
the
Princess
looked
at
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Like
trying
to
stare
one
another
out
,
"
said
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Please
go
on
,
Little
Mother
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Princess
was
such
a
wonderful
Princess
that
she
had
the
power
of
knowing
secrets
,
and
she
said
to
the
tiny
woman
,
Why
do
you
keep
it
there
?
 
<EOS>
This
showed
her
directly
that
the
Princess
knew
why
she
lived
all
alone
by
herself
spinning
at
her
wheel
,
and
she
kneeled
down
at
the
Princess
's
feet
,
and
asked
her
never
to
betray
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
Princess
said
,
I
never
will
betray
you
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
tiny
woman
closed
the
shutter
of
the
cottage
window
and
fastened
the
door
,
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
for
fear
that
any
one
should
suspect
her
,
opened
a
very
secret
place
and
showed
the
Princess
a
shadow
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Lor
!
"
said
Maggy
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
shadow
of
Some
one
who
had
gone
by
long
before
:
of
Some
one
who
had
gone
on
far
away
quite
out
of
reach
,
never
,
never
to
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
bright
to
look
at
;
and
when
the
tiny
woman
showed
it
to
the
Princess
,
she
was
proud
of
it
with
all
her
heart
,
as
a
great
,
great
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Princess
had
considered
it
a
little
while
,
she
said
to
the
tiny
woman
,
And
you
keep
watch
over
this
every
day
?
 
<EOS>
And
she
cast
down
her
eyes
,
and
whispered
,
Yes
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Princess
said
,
Remind
me
why
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
the
other
replied
,
that
no
one
so
good
and
kind
had
ever
passed
that
way
,
and
that
was
why
in
the
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
too
,
that
nobody
missed
it
,
that
nobody
was
the
worse
for
it
,
that
Some
one
had
gone
on
,
to
those
who
were
expecting
him
---
"
   
"
Some
one
was
a
man
then
?
"
<EOS>
interposed
Maggy
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
timidly
said
Yes
,
she
believed
so
;
and
resumed
:
   
"
---
<EOS>
Had
gone
on
to
those
who
were
expecting
him
,
and
that
this
remembrance
was
stolen
or
kept
back
from
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
The
Princess
made
answer
,
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
cottager
died
it
would
be
discovered
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
tiny
woman
told
her
No
;
when
that
time
came
,
it
would
sink
quietly
into
her
own
grave
,
and
would
never
be
found
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
be
sure
!
"
said
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Princess
was
very
much
astonished
to
hear
this
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
Maggy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
"
And
well
she
might
be
,
"
said
Maggy
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
So
she
resolved
to
watch
the
tiny
woman
,
and
see
what
came
of
it
.
<EOS>
Every
day
she
drove
in
her
beautiful
carriage
by
the
cottage
-
door
,
and
there
she
saw
the
tiny
woman
always
alone
by
herself
spinning
at
her
wheel
,
and
she
looked
at
the
tiny
woman
,
and
the
tiny
woman
looked
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
one
day
the
wheel
was
still
,
and
the
tiny
woman
was
not
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Princess
made
inquiries
why
the
wheel
had
stopped
,
and
where
the
tiny
woman
was
,
she
was
informed
that
the
wheel
had
stopped
because
there
was
nobody
to
turn
it
,
the
tiny
woman
being
dead
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
(
"
They
ought
to
have
took
her
to
the
Hospital
,
"
said
Maggy
,
"
and
then
she
'd
have
got
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Princess
,
after
crying
a
very
little
for
the
loss
of
the
tiny
woman
,
dried
her
eyes
and
got
out
of
her
carriage
at
the
place
where
she
had
stopped
it
before
,
and
went
to
the
cottage
and
peeped
in
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
to
look
at
her
now
,
and
nobody
for
her
to
look
at
,
so
she
went
in
at
once
to
search
for
the
treasured
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
sign
of
it
to
be
found
anywhere
;
and
then
she
knew
that
the
tiny
woman
had
told
her
the
truth
,
and
that
it
would
never
give
anybody
any
trouble
,
and
that
it
had
sunk
quietly
into
her
own
grave
,
and
that
she
and
it
were
at
rest
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
,
Maggy
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
sunset
flush
was
so
bright
on
Little
Dorrit
's
face
when
she
came
thus
to
the
end
of
her
story
,
that
she
interposed
her
hand
to
shade
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Had
she
got
to
be
old
?
"
<EOS>
Maggy
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
tiny
woman
?
"
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
if
she
had
been
ever
so
old
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
it
raly
!
"
said
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
suppose
it
would
though
.
"
<EOS>
And
sat
staring
and
ruminating
.
   
<EOS>
She
sat
so
long
with
her
eyes
wide
open
,
that
at
length
Little
Dorrit
,
to
entice
her
from
her
box
,
rose
and
looked
out
of
window
.
<EOS>
As
she
glanced
down
into
the
yard
,
she
saw
Pancks
come
in
and
leer
up
with
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
he
went
by
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
's
he
,
Little
Mother
?
"
said
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
joined
her
at
the
window
and
was
leaning
on
her
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
come
in
and
out
often
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
him
called
a
fortune
-
teller
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
doubt
if
he
could
tell
many
people
even
their
past
or
present
fortunes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
have
told
the
Princess
hers
?
"
said
Maggy
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
looking
musingly
down
into
the
dark
valley
of
the
prison
,
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
the
tiny
woman
hers
?
"
said
Maggy
.
   
<EOS>
"
No

said
Little
Dorrit
,
with
the
sunset
very
bright
upon
her
.

<EOS>
But
let
us
come
away
from

The
private
residence
of
Mr
Pancks
was
in
Pentonville
,
where
he
lodged
on
the
second
-
floor
of
a
professional
gentleman
in
an
extremely
small
way
,
who
had
an
inner
-
door
within
the
street
door
,
poised
on
a
spring
and
starting
open
with
a

like
a

<EOS>
This
scroll
,
majestic
in
its
severe
simplicity
,
illuminated
a
little
slip
of
front
garden
abutting
on
the
thirsty
high
-
road
,
where
a
few
of
the
dustiest
of
leaves
hung
their
dismal
heads
and
led
a
life
of
choking
.
 
<EOS>
A
professor
of
writing
occupied
the
first
-
floor
,
and
enlivened
the
garden
railings
with
glass
-
cases
containing
choice
examples
of
what
his
pupils
had
been
before
six
lessons
and
while
the
whole
of
his
young
family
shook
the
table
,
and
what
they
had
become
after
six
lessons
when
the
young
family
was
under
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
The
tenancy
of
Mr
Pancks
was
limited
to
one
airy
bedroom
;
he
covenanting
and
agreeing
with
Mr
Rugg
his
landlord
,
that
in
consideration
of
a
certain
scale
of
payments
accurately
defined
,
and
on
certain
verbal
notice
duly
given
,
he
should
be
at
liberty
to
elect
to
share
the
Sunday
breakfast
,
dinner
,
tea
,
or
supper
,
or
each
or
any
or
all
of
those
repasts
or
meals
of
Mr
and
Miss
Rugg
(
his
daughter
)
in
the
back
-
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Rugg
was
a
lady
of
a
little
property
which
she
had
acquired
,
together
with
much
distinction
in
the
neighbourhood
,
by
having
her
heart
severely
lacerated
and
<EOS>
her
feelings
mangled
by
a
middle
-
aged
baker
resident
in
the
vicinity
,
against
whom
she
had
,
by
the
agency
of
Mr
Rugg
,
found
it
necessary
to
proceed
at
law
to
recover
damages
for
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
The
baker
having
been
,
by
the
counsel
for
Miss
Rugg
,
witheringly
denounced
on
that
occasion
up
to
the
full
amount
of
twenty
guineas
,
at
the
rate
of
about
eighteen

pence
an

having
been
cast
in
corresponding
damages

still
suffered
occasional
persecution
from

youth
of

.
 
<EOS>
But
Miss
Rugg
,
environed
by
the
majesty
of
the
law
,
and
having
her
damages
invested
in
the
public
securities
,
was
regarded
with
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
society
of
Mr
Rugg
,
who
had
a
round
white
visage
,
as
if
all
his
blushes
had
been
drawn
out
of
him
long
ago
,
and
who
had
a
ragged
yellow
head
like
a
worn
-
out
hearth
broom
;
and
in
the
society
of
Miss
Rugg
,
who
had
little
nankeen
spots
,
like
shirt
buttons
,
all
over
her
face
,
and
whose
own
yellow
tresses
were
rather
scrubby
than
luxuriant
;
Mr
Pancks
had
usually
dined
on
Sundays
for
some
few
years
,
and
had
twice
a
week
,
or
so
,
enjoyed
an
evening
collation
of
bread
,
Dutch
cheese
,
and
porter
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
was
one
of
the
very
few
marriageable
men
for
whom
Miss
Rugg
had
no
terrors
,
the
argument
with
which
he
reassured
himself
being
twofold
;
that
is
to
say
,
firstly
,
"
that
it
would
n't
do
twice
,
"
and
secondly
,
"
that
he
was
n't
worth
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Fortified
within
this
double
armour
,
Mr
Pancks
snorted
at
Miss
Rugg
on
easy
terms
.
   
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
,
Mr
Pancks
had
transacted
little
or
no
business
at
his
quarters
in
Pentonville
,
except
in
the
sleeping
line
;
but
now
that
he
had
become
a
fortune
-
teller
,
he
was
often
closeted
after
midnight
with
Mr
Rugg
in
his
little
front
-
parlour
office
,
and
even
after
those
untimely
hours
,
burnt
tallow
in
his
bed
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Though
his
duties
as
his
proprietor
's
grubber
were
in
no
wise
lessened
;
and
though
that
service
bore
no
greater
resemblance
to
a
bed
of
roses
than
was
to
be
discovered
in
its
many
thorns
;
some
new
branch
of
industry
made
a
constant
demand
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
cast
off
the
Patriarch
at
night
,
it
was
only
to
take
an
anonymous
craft
in
tow
,
and
labour
away
afresh
in
other
waters
.
   
<EOS>
The
advance
from
a
personal
acquaintance
with
the
elder
Mr
Chivery
to
an
introduction
to
his
amiable
wife
and
disconsolate
son
,
may
have
been
easy
;
but
easy
or
not
,
Mr
Pancks
soon
made
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
nestled
in
the
bosom
of
the
tobacco
business
within
a
week
or
two
after
his
first
appearance
in
the
College
,
and
particularly
addressed
himself
to
the
cultivation
of
a
good
understanding
with
Young
John
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
endeavour
he
so
prospered
as
to
lure
that
pining
shepherd
forth
from
the
groves
,
and
tempt
him
to
undertake
mysterious
missions
;
on
which
he
began
to
disappear
at
uncertain
intervals
for
as
long
a
space
as
two
or
three
days
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
prudent
Mrs
Chivery
,
who
wondered
greatly
at
this
change
,
would
have
protested
against
it
as
detrimental
to
the
Highland
typification
on
the
doorpost
but
for
two
forcible
reasons
;
one
,
that
her
John
was
roused
to
take
strong
interest
in
the
business
which
these
starts
were
supposed
to
advance
---
and
this
she
held
to
be
good
for
his
drooping
spirits
;
the
other
,
that
Mr
Pancks
confidentially
agreed
to
pay
her
,
for
the
occupation
of
her
son
's
time
,
at
the
handsome
rate
of
seven
and
sixpence
per
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
proposal
originated
with
himself
,
and
was
couched
in
the
pithy
terms
,
"
If
your
John
is
weak
enough
,
ma'am
,
not
to
take
it
,
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
be
,
do
n't
you
see
?
 
<EOS>
So
,
quite
between
ourselves
,
ma'am
,
business
being
business
,
here
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
What
Mr
Chivery
thought
of
these
things
,
or
how
much
or
how
little
he
knew
about
them
,
was
never
gathered
from
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
already
remarked
that
he
was
a
man
of
few
words
;
and
it
may
be
here
observed
that
he
had
imbibed
a
professional
habit
of
locking
everything
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
locked
himself
up
as
carefully
as
he
locked
up
the
Marshalsea
debtors
.
 
<EOS>
Even
his
custom
of
bolting
his
meals
may
have
been
a
part
of
an
uniform
whole
;
but
there
is
no
question
,
that
,
as
to
all
other
purposes
,
he
kept
his
mouth
as
he
kept
the
Marshalsea
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
opened
it
without
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
necessary
to
let
anything
out
,
he
opened
it
a
little
way
,
held
it
open
just
as
long
as
sufficed
for
the
purpose
,
and
locked
it
again
.
   
<EOS>
Even
as
he
would
be
sparing
of
his
trouble
at
the
Marshalsea
door
,
and
would
keep
a
visitor
who
wanted
to
go
out
,
waiting
for
a
few
moments
if
he
saw
another
visitor
coming
down
the
yard
,
so
that
one
turn
of
the
key
should
suffice
for
both
,
similarly
he
would
often
reserve
a
remark
if
he
perceived
another
on
its
way
to
his
lips
,
and
would
deliver
himself
of
the
two
together
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
any
key
to
his
inner
knowledge
being
to
be
found
in
his
face
,
the
Marshalsea
key
was
as
legible
as
an
index
to
the
individual
characters
and
histories
upon
which
it
was
turned
.
   
<EOS>
That
Mr
Pancks
should
be
moved
to
invite
any
one
to
dinner
at
Pentonville
,
was
an
unprecedented
fact
in
his
calendar
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
invited
Young
John
to
dinner
,
and
even
brought
him
within
range
of
the
dangerous
(
because
expensive
)
fascinations
of
Miss
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
The
banquet
was
appointed
for
a
Sunday
,
and
Miss
Rugg
with
her
own
hands
stuffed
a
leg
of
mutton
with
oysters
on
the
occasion
,
and
sent
it
to
the
baker
's
---
not
THE
baker
's
but
an
opposition
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
Provision
of
oranges
,
apples
,
and
nuts
was
also
made
.
 
<EOS>
And
rum
was
brought
home
by
Mr
Pancks
on
Saturday
night
,
to
gladden
the
visitor
's
heart
.
<EOS>
The
store
of
creature
comforts
was
not
the
chief
part
of
the
visitor
's
reception
.
 
<EOS>
Its
special
feature
was
a
foregone
family
confidence
and
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
When
Young
John
appeared
at
half
-
past
one
without
the
ivory
hand
and
waistcoat
of
golden
sprigs
,
the
sun
shorn
of
his
beams
by
disastrous
clouds
,
Mr
Pancks
presented
him
to
the
yellow
-
haired
Ruggs
as
the
young
man
he
had
so
often
mentioned
who
loved
Miss
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
challenging
him
specially
in
that
character
,
"
to
have
the
distinguished
gratification
of
making
your
acquaintance
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Your
feelings
do
you
honour
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
young
;
may
you
never
outlive
your
feelings
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
to
outlive
my
own
feelings
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
who
was
a
man
of
many
words
,
and
was
considered
to
possess
a
remarkably
good
address
;
"
if
I
was
to
outlive
my
own
feelings
,
I
'd
leave
fifty
pound
in
my
will
to
the
man
who
would
put
me
out
of
existence
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Rugg
heaved
a
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anastatia
,
you
are
no
stranger
to
the
state
of
this
young
man
's
affections
.
 
<EOS>
My
daughter
has
had
her
trials
,
sir
"
---
Mr
Rugg
might
have
used
the
word
more
pointedly
in
the
singular
number
---
"
and
she
can
feel
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Young
John
,
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
touching
nature
of
this
greeting
,
professed
himself
to
that
effect
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
envy
you
,
sir
,
is
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
"
allow
me
to
take
your
hat
---
we
are
rather
short
of
pegs
---
I
'll
put
it
in
the
corner
,
nobody
will
tread
on
it
there
---
<EOS>
What
I
envy
you
,
sir
,
is
the
luxury
of
your
own
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
I
belong
to
a
profession
in
which
that
luxury
is
sometimes
denied
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Young
John
replied
,
with
acknowledgments
,
that
he
only
hoped
he
did
what
was
right
,
and
what
showed
how
entirely
he
was
devoted
to
Miss
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
He
wished
to
be
unselfish
;
and
he
hoped
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
wished
to
do
anything
as
laid
in
his
power
to
serve
Miss
Dorrit
,
altogether
putting
himself
out
of
sight
;
and
he
hoped
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
<EOS>
little
that
he
could
do
,
but
he
hoped
he
did
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
"
you
are
a
young
man
that
it
does
one
good
to
come
across
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
young
man
that
I
should
like
to
put
in
the
witness
-
box
,
to
humanise
the
minds
of
the
legal
profession
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
brought
your
appetite
with
you
,
and
intend
to
play
a
good
knife
and
fork
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
Young
John
,
"
I
do
n't
eat
much
at
present
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
drew
him
a
little
apart
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
's
case
,
sir
,
"
said
he
,
"
at
the
time
when
,
in
vindication
of
her
outraged
feelings
and
her
sex
,
she
became
the
plaintiff
in
Rugg
and
Bawkins
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
could
have
put
it
in
evidence
,
Mr
Chivery
,
if
I
had
thought
it
worth
my
while
,
that
the
amount
of
solid
sustenance
my
daughter
consumed
at
that
period
did
not
exceed
ten
ounces
per
week
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
go
a
little
beyond
that
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
other
,
hesitating
,
as
if
he
confessed
it
with
some
shame
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
in
your
case
there
's
no
fiend
in
human
form
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
with
argumentative
smile
and
action
of
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Observe
,
Mr
Chivery
!
   
<EOS>
No
fiend
in
human
form
!
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
certainly
,
"
Young
John
added
with
simplicity
,
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
if
there
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
sentiment
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
"
is
what
I
should
have
expected
from
your
known
principles
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
affect
my
daughter
greatly
,
sir
,
if
she
heard
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
perceive
the
mutton
,
I
am
glad
she
did
n't
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
on
this
occasion
,
pray
face
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
face
Mr
Chivery
.
 
<EOS>
For
what
we
are
going
to
receive
,
may
we
(
and
Miss
Dorrit
)
be
truly
thankful
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
for
a
grave
waggishness
in
Mr
Rugg
's
manner
of
delivering
this
introduction
to
the
feast
,
it
might
have
appeared
that
Miss
Dorrit
was
expected
to
be
one
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
Pancks
recognised
the
sally
in
his
usual
way
,
and
took
in
his
provender
in
his
usual
way
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Rugg
,
perhaps
making
up
some
of
her
arrears
,
likewise
took
very
kindly
to
the
mutton
,
and
it
rapidly
diminished
to
the
bone
.
 
<EOS>
A
bread
-
and
-
butter
pudding
entirely
disappeared
,
and
a
considerable
amount
of
cheese
and
radishes
vanished
by
the
same
means
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
dessert
.
   
<EOS>
Then
also
,
and
before
the
broaching
of
the
rum
and
water
,
came
Mr
Pancks
's
note
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
The
ensuing
business
proceedings
were
brief
but
curious
,
and
rather
in
the
nature
of
a
conspiracy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
looked
over
his
note
-
book
,
which
was
now
getting
full
,
studiously
;
and
picked
out
little
extracts
,
which
he
wrote
on
separate
slips
of
paper
on
the
table
;
Mr
Rugg
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
looking
at
him
with
close
attention
,
and
Young
John
losing
his
uncollected
eye
in
mists
of
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Pancks
,
who
supported
the
character
of
chief
conspirator
,
had
completed
his
extracts
,
he
looked
them
over
,
corrected
them
,
put
up
his
note
-
book
,
and
held
them
like
a
hand
at
cards
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
there
's
a
churchyard
in
Bedfordshire
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
takes
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Rugg
,
"
if
no
one
bids
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
dealt
him
his
card
,
and
looked
at
his
hand
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
there
's
an
Enquiry
in
York
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
takes
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
good
for
York
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
perhaps
,
"
pursued
Pancks
,
"
you
'll
be
so
obliging
,
John
Chivery
?
"
 
<EOS>
Young
John
assenting
<EOS>
,
Pancks
dealt
him
his
card
,
and
consulted
his
hand
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
Church
in
London
;
I
may
as
well
take
that
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
Family
Bible
<EOS>
;
I
may
as
well
take
that
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
two
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Two
to
me
,
"
repeated
Pancks
,
breathing
hard
over
his
cards
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
Clerk
at
Durham
for
you
,
John
,
and
an
old
seafaring
gentleman
at
Dunstable
for
you
,
Mr
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
Two
to
me
,
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
two
to
me
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
Stone
;
three
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
Still
-
born
Baby
;
four
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
all
,
for
the
present
,
told
.
<EOS>
"
When
he
had
thus
disposed
of
his
cards
,
all
being
done
very
quietly
and
in
a
suppressed
tone
,
Mr
Pancks
puffed
his
way
into
his
own
breast
-
pocket
and
tugged
out
a
canvas
bag
;
from
which
,
with
a
sparing
hand
,
he
told
forth
money
for
travelling
expenses
in
two
little
portions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cash
goes
out
fast
,
"
he
said
anxiously
,
as
he
pushed
a
portion
to
each
of
his
male
companions
,
"
very
fast
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
assure
you
,
Mr
Pancks
,
"
said
Young
John
,
"
that
I
deeply
regret
my
circumstances
being
such
that
I
ca
n't
afford
to
pay
my
own
charges

or
that
it
's
not
advisable
to
allow
me
the
time
necessary
for
my
doing
the
distances
on
foot
;
because
nothing
would
give
me
greater
satisfaction
than
to
walk
myself
off
my
legs
without
fee
or
reward

This
young
man
's
disinterestedness
appeared
so
very
ludicrous
in
the
eyes
of
Miss
Rugg
,
that
she
was
obliged
to
effect
a
precipitate
retirement
from
the
company
,
and
to
sit
upon
the
stairs
until
she
had
had
her
laugh
out
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Mr
Pancks
,
looking
,
not
without
some
pity
,
at
Young
John
,
slowly
and
thoughtfully
twisted
up
his
canvas
bag
as
if
he
were
wringing
its
neck
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
,
returning
as
he
restored
it
to
his
pocket
,
mixed
rum
and
water
for
the
party
,
not
forgetting
her
fair
self
,
and
handed
to
every
one
his
glass
.
<EOS>
When
all
were
supplied
,
Mr
Rugg
rose
,
and
silently
holding
out
his
glass
at
arm
's
length
above
the
centre
of
the
table
,
by
that
gesture
<EOS>
invited
the
other
three
to
add
theirs
,
and
to
unite
in
a
general
conspiratorial
clink
.
 
<EOS>
The
ceremony
was
effective
up
to
a
certain
point
,
and
would
have
been
wholly
so
throughout
,
if
Miss
Rugg
,
as
she
raised
her
glass
to
her
lips
in
completion
of
it
,
had
not
happened
to
look
at
Young
John
;
when
she
was
again
<EOS>
so
overcome
by
the
contemptible
comicality
of
his
disinterestedness
as
to
splutter
some
ambrosial
drops
of
rum
and
water
around
,
and
withdraw
in
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
dinner
without
precedent
,
given
by
Pancks
at
Pentonville
;
and
such
was
the
busy
and
strange
life
Pancks
led
.
<EOS>
The
only
waking
moments
at
which
he
appeared
to
relax
from
his
cares
,
and
to
recreate
himself
by
going
anywhere
or
saying
anything
without
a
pervading
object
,
were
when
he
showed
a
dawning
interest
in
the
lame
foreigner
with
the
stick
,
down
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
.
   
<EOS>
The
foreigner
,
by
name
John
Baptist
Cavalletto
---
they
called
him
Mr
Baptist
in
the
Yard
---
was
such
a
chirping
,
easy
,
hopeful
little
fellow
,
that
his
attraction
for
Pancks
was
probably
in
the
force
of
contrast
.
 
<EOS>
Solitary
,
weak
,
and
scantily
acquainted
with
the
most
necessary
words
of
the
only
language
in
which
he
could
communicate
with
the
people
about
him
<EOS>
,
he
went
with
the
stream
of
his
fortunes
,
in
a
brisk
way
that
was
new
in
those
parts
.
 
<EOS>
With
little
to
eat
,
and
less
to
drink
,
and
nothing
to
wear
but
what
he
wore
upon
him
,
or
had
brought
tied
up
in
one
of
the
smallest
bundles
that
ever
were
seen
,
he
put
as
bright
a
face
upon
it
as
if
he
were
in
the
most
flourishing
circumstances
when
he
first
hobbled
up
and
down
the
Yard
,
humbly
propitiating
the
general
good
-
will
with
his
white
teeth
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
uphill
work
for
a
foreigner
,
lame
or
sound
,
to
make
his
way
with
the
Bleeding
Hearts
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
they
were
vaguely
persuaded
that
every
foreigner
had
a
knife
about
him
;
in
the
second
,
they
held
it
to
be
a
sound
constitutional
national
axiom
that
he
ought
to
go
home
to
his
own
country
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
thought
of
inquiring
how
many
of
their
own
countrymen
would
be
returned
upon
their
hands
from
divers
parts
of
the
world
,
if
the
principle
were
generally
recognised
;
they
considered
it
particularly
and
peculiarly
British
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
third
place
,
they
had
a
notion
that
it
was
a
sort
of
Divine
visitation
upon
a
foreigner
that
he
was
not
an
Englishman
,
and
that
all
kinds
of
calamities
happened
to
his
country
because
it
did
things
that
England
did
not
,
and
did
not
do
things
that
England
did
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
belief
,
to
be
sure
,
they
had
long
been
carefully
trained
by
the
Barnacles
and
Stiltstalkings
,
who
were
always
proclaiming
to
them
,
officially
,
that
no
country
which
failed
to
submit
itself
to
those
two
large
families
could
possibly
hope
to
be
under
the
protection
of
Providence
;
and
who
,
when
they
believed
it
,
disparaged
them
in
private
as
the
most
prejudiced
people
under
the
sun
.
   
<EOS>
This
,
therefore
,
might
be
called
a
political
position
of
the
Bleeding
Hearts
;
but
they
entertained
other
objections
to
having
foreigners
in
the
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
They
believed
that
foreigners
were
always
badly
off
;
and
though
they
were
as
ill
off
themselves
as
they
could
desire
to
be
,
that
did
not
diminish
the
force
of
the
objection
.
<EOS>
They
believed
that
foreigners
were
dragooned
and
bayoneted
;
and
though
they
certainly
got
their
own
skulls
promptly
fractured
if
they
showed
any
ill
-
humour
,
still
it
was
with
a
blunt
instrument
,
and
that
did
n't
count
.
 
<EOS>
They
believed
that
foreigners
were
always
immoral
;
and
though
they
had
an
occasional
assize
at
home
,
and
now
and
then
a
divorce
case
or
so
,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
They
believed
that
foreigners
had
no
independent
spirit
,
as
never
being
escorted
to
the
poll
in
droves
by
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
,
with
colours
flying
and
the
tune
of
Rule
Britannia
playing
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
be
tedious
,
they
had
many
other
beliefs
of
a
similar
kind
.
   
<EOS>
Against
these
obstacles
,
the
lame
foreigner
with
the
stick
had
to
make
head
as
well
as
he
could
;
not
absolutely
single
-
handed
,
because
Mr
Arthur
Clennam
had
recommended
him
to
the
Plornishes
(
he
lived
at
the
top
of
the
same
house
)
,
but
still
at
heavy
odds
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
Bleeding
Hearts
were
kind
hearts
;
and
when
they
saw
the
little
fellow
cheerily
limping
about
with
a
good
-
humoured
face
,
doing
no
harm
,
drawing
no
knives
,
committing
no
outrageous
immoralities
,
living
chiefly
on
farinaceous
and
milk
diet
,
and
playing
with
Mrs
Plornish
's
children
of
an
evening
,
they
began
to
think
that
although
he
could
never
hope
to
be
an
Englishman
,
still
it
would
be
hard
to
visit
that
affliction
on
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
They
began
to
accommodate
themselves
to
his
level
,
calling
him
"
Mr
Baptist
,
"
but
treating
him
like
a
baby
,
and
laughing
immoderately
at
his
lively
gestures
and
his
childish
English
---
more
,
because
he
did
n't
mind
it
,
and
laughed
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
spoke
to
him
in
very
loud
voices
as
if
he
were
stone
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
They
constructed
sentences
,
by
way
of
teaching
him
the
language
in
its
purity
,
such
as
were
addressed
by
the
savages
to
Captain
Cook
,
or
by
Friday
to
Robinson
Crusoe
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
was
particularly
ingenious
in
this
art
;
and
attained
so
much
celebrity
for
saying
"
Me
ope
you
leg
well
soon
,
"
that
it
was
considered
in
the
Yard
but
a
very
short
remove
indeed
from
speaking
Italian
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Mrs
Plornish
herself
began
to
think
that
she
had
a
natural
call
towards
that
language
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
became
more
popular
,
household
objects
were
brought
into
requisition
for
his
instruction
in
a
copious
vocabulary
;
and
whenever
he
appeared
in
the
Yard
ladies
would
fly
out
at
their
doors
crying
"
Mr
Baptist
---
tea
-
pot
!
"
<EOS>
"
Mr
Baptist
---
dust
-
pan
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Baptist
---
flour
-
dredger
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Baptist
---
coffee
-
biggin
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
exhibiting
those
articles
,
and
penetrating
him
with
a
sense
of
the
appalling
difficulties
of
the
Anglo
-
Saxon
tongue
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
stage
of
his
progress
,
and
in
about
the
third
week
of
his
occupation
,
that
Mr
Pancks
's
fancy
became
attracted
by
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
Mounting
to
his
attic
,
attended
by
Mrs
Plornish
as
interpreter
,
he
found
Mr
Baptist
with
no
furniture
but
his
bed
on
the
ground
,
a
table
,
and
a
chair
,
carving
with
the
aid
of
a
few
simple
tools
,
in
the
blithest
way
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
old
chap
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
"
pay
up
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
his
money
ready
,
folded
in
a
scrap
of
paper
,
and
laughingly
handed
it
in
;
then
with
a
free
action
,
threw
out
as
many
fingers
of
his
right
hand
as
there
were
shillings
,
and
made
a
cut
crosswise
in
the
air
for
an
odd
sixpence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
watching
him
,
wonderingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
quick
customer
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
expect
to
receive
it
,
though
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
here
interposed
with
great
condescension
,
and
explained
to
Mr
Baptist
.
 
<EOS>
"
E
please
.
 
<EOS>
E
glad
get
money
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
little
man
smiled
and
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
His
bright
face
seemed
uncommonly
attractive
to
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
's
he
getting
on
in
his
limb
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
asked
Mrs
Plornish
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
's
a
deal
better
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
expect
next
week
he
'll
be
able
to
leave
off
his
stick
entirely
.
"
 
<EOS>
(
The
opportunity
being
too
favourable
to
be
lost
,
Mrs
Plornish
displayed
her
great
accomplishment
by
explaining
with
pardonable
pride
to
Mr
Baptist
,
"
E
ope
<EOS>
you
leg
well
soon
.
<EOS>
"
)
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
merry
fellow
,
too
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
admiring
him
as
if
he
were
a
mechanical
toy
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
does
he
live
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
he
turns
out
to
have
quite
a
power
of
carving
them
flowers
that
you
see
him
at
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Mr
Baptist
,
watching
their
faces
as
they
spoke
,
held
up
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
interpreted
in
her
Italian
manner
,
on
behalf
of
Mr
Pancks
,
"
E
please
.
 
<EOS>
Double
good
!
<EOS>
"
)
   
"
Can
he
live
by
that
?
"
asked
Mr
Pancks
.
<EOS>
"
He
can
live
on
very
little
,
sir
,
and
it
is
expected
as
he
will
be
able
,
in
time
,
to
make
a
very
good
living
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
got
it
him
to
do
,
and
gives
him
odd
jobs
besides
in
at
the
Works
next
door
---
makes
'em
for
him
,
in
short
,
when
he
knows
he
wants
'

<EOS>
"
And
what
does
he
do
with
himself
,
now
,
when
he
ai
n't
hard
at
it
?
"
said
Mr
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
not
much
as
yet
,
sir
,
on
accounts
I
suppose
of
not
being
able
to
walk
much
;
but
he
goes
about
the
Yard
,
and
he
chats
without
particular
understanding
or
being
understood
,
and
he
plays
with
the
children
,
and
he
sits
in
the
sun
<EOS>
---
he
'll
sit
down
anywhere
,
as
if
it
was
an
arm
-
chair
---
and
he
'll
sing
,
and
he
'll
laugh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Laugh
!
"
echoed
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
looks
to
me
as
if
every
tooth
in
his
head
was
always
laughing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
whenever
he
gets
to
the
top
of
the
steps
at
t'other
end
of
the
Yard
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
he
'll
peep
out
in
the
curiousest
way
!
<EOS>
So
that
some
of
us
thinks
he
's
peeping
out
towards
where
his
own
country
is
,
and
some
of
us
thinks
he
's
looking
for
somebody
he
do
n't
want
to
see
,
and
some
of
us
do
n't
know
what
to
think
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
seemed
to
have
a
general
understanding
of
what
she
said
;
or
perhaps
his
quickness
caught
and
applied
her
slight
action
of
peeping
.
 
<EOS>
In
any
case
he
closed
his
eyes
and
tossed
his
head
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
sufficient
reasons
for
what
he
did
,
and
said
in
his
own
tongue
,
it
did
n't
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Altro
!
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
Altro
?
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
sort
of
a
general
kind
of
expression
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
Altro
to
you
,
old
chap
.
 
<EOS>
Good
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Altro
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
in
his
vivacious
way
repeating
the
word
several
times
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pancks
in
his
duller
way
gave
it
him
back
once
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
time
it
became
a
frequent
custom
with
Pancks
the
gipsy
,
as
he
went
home
jaded
at
night
,
to
pass
round
by
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
go
quietly
up
the
stairs
,
look
in
at
Mr
Baptist
's
door
,
and
,
finding
him
in
his
room
,
to
say
,
"
Hallo
,
old
chap
!
 
<EOS>
Altro
!
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
Mr
Baptist
would
reply
with
innumerable
bright
nods
and
smiles
,
"
Altro
,
signore
,
altro
,
altro
,
altro
!
"
 
<EOS>
After
this
highly
condensed
conversation
,
Mr
Pancks
would
go
his
way
with
an
appearance
of
being
lightened
and
refreshed
.

Nobody
's
State
of
Mind
 
<EOS>
If
Arthur
Clennam
had
not
arrived
at
that
wise
decision
firmly
to
restrain
himself
from
loving
Pet
,
he
would
have
lived
on
in
a
state
of
much
perplexity
,
involving
difficult
struggles
with
his
own
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Not
the
least
of
these
would
have
been
a
contention
,
always
waging
within
it
,
between
a
tendency
to
dislike
Mr
Henry
Gowan
,
if
not
to
regard
him
with
positive
repugnance
,
and
a
whisper
that
the
inclination
was
unworthy
.
 
<EOS>
A
generous
nature
is
not
prone
to
strong
aversions
,
and
is
slow
to
admit
them
even
dispassionately
;
but
when
it
finds
ill
-
will
gaining
upon
it
,
and
can
discern
between
-
whiles
that
its
origin
is
not
dispassionate
,
such
a
nature
becomes
distressed
.
   
<EOS>
Therefore
Mr
Henry
Gowan
would
have
clouded
Clennam
's
mind
,
and
would
have
been
far
oftener
present
to
it
than
more
agreeable
persons
and
subjects
but
for
the
great
prudence
of
his
decision
aforesaid
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
Mr
Gowan
seemed
transferred
to
Daniel
Doyce
's
mind
;
at
all
events
,
it
so
happened
that
it
usually
fell
to
Mr
Doyce
's
turn
,
rather
than
to
Clennam
's
,
to
speak
of
him
in
the
friendly
conversations
they
held
together
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
of
frequent
occurrence
now
;
as
the
two
partners
shared
a
portion
of
a
roomy
house
in
one
of
the
grave
old
-
fashioned
City
streets
,
lying
not
far
from
the
Bank
of
England
,
by
London
Wall
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Doyce
had
been
to
Twickenham
to
pass
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
had
excused
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Doyce
was
just
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
in
his
head
at
the
door
of
Clennam
's
sitting
-
room
to
say
Good
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
come
in
!
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
you
were
reading
,
"
returned
Doyce
,
as
he
entered
,
"
and
thought
you
might
not
care
to
be
disturbed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
But
for
the
notable
resolution
he
had
made
,
Clennam
really
might
not
have
known
what
he
had
been
reading
;
really
might
not
have
had
his
eyes
upon
the
book
for
an
hour
past
,
though
it
lay
open
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
shut
it
up
,
rather
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
well
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Doyce
;
"
they
are
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
all
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Daniel
had
an
old
workmanlike
habit
of
carrying
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
in
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
out
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
it
,
slowly
repeating
,
"
They
are
all
well
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Minnie
looking
particularly
well
,
I
thought
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Any
company
at
the
cottage
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
company
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
get
on
,
you
four
?
"
asked
Clennam
gaily
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
were
five
of
us
,
"
returned
his
partner
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
What's
-
his
-
name
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
there
.
"
<EOS>
"
Who
is
he
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Henry
Gowan
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Clennam
with
unusual
vivacity
,
"
Yes
!
---
<EOS>
I
forgot
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
mentioned
,
you
may
remember
,
"
said
Daniel
Doyce
,
"
he
is
always
there
on
Sunday
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
returned
Clennam
;
"
I
remember
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
Daniel
Doyce
,
still
wiping
his
forehead
,
ploddingly
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
there
,
he
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
he
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
And
his
dog
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
there
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Meagles
is
quite
attached
to
---
the
---
dog
,
"
observed
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
so
,
"
assented
his
partner
.
 
<EOS>
"
More
attached
to
the
dog
than
I
am
to
the
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
Mr
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
Mr
Gowan
,
most
decidedly
,
"
said
Daniel
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
gap
in
the
conversation
,
which
Clennam
devoted
to
winding
up
his
watch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
are
a
little
hasty
in
your
judgment
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
judgments
---
I
am
supposing
a
general
case
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Of
course
,
"
said
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
so
liable
to
be
influenced
by
many
considerations
,
which
,
almost
without
our
knowing
it
,
are
unfair
,
that
it
is
necessary
to
keep
a
guard
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
Mr
---
"
   
"
Gowan
,
"
quietly
said
Doyce
,
upon
whom
the
utterance
of
the
name
almost
always
devolved
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
young
and
handsome
,
easy
and
quick
,
has
talent
,
and
has
seen
a
good
deal
of
various
kinds
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
be
difficult
to
give
an
unselfish
reason
for
being
prepossessed
against
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
difficult
for
me
,
I
think
,
Clennam
,
"
returned
his
partner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
bringing
present
anxiety
,
and
,
I
fear
,
future
sorrow
,
into
my
old
friend
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
wearing
deeper
lines
into
my
old
friend
's
face
,
the
nearer
he
draws
to
,
and
the
oftener
he
looks
at
,
the
face
of
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
see
him
with
a
net
about
the
pretty
and
affectionate
creature
whom
he
will
never
make
happy
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Clennam
,
almost
in
the
tone
of
a
man
in
pain
,
"
that
he
will
not
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
know
,
"
returned
his
partner
,
"
that
the
earth
will
last
another
hundred
years
,
but
we
think
it
highly
probable
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
said
Clennam
,
"
we
must
be
hopeful
,
and
we
must
at
least
try
to
be
,
if
not
generous
<EOS>
(
which
,
in
this
case
,
we
have
no
opportunity
of
being
)
,
just
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
disparage
this
gentleman
,
because
he
is
successful
in
his
addresses
to
the
beautiful
object
of
his
ambition
;
and
we
will
not
question
her
natural
right
to
bestow
her
love
on
one
whom
she
finds
worthy
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Maybe
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
"
Maybe
also
,
that
she
is
too
young
and
petted
,
too
confiding
and
inexperienced
,
to
discriminate
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
would
be
far
beyond
our
power
of
correction
.
"
   
<EOS>
Daniel
Doyce
shook
his
head
gravely
,
and
rejoined
,
"
I
fear
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
in
a
word
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
we
should
make
up
our
minds
that
it
is
not
worthy
of
us
to
say
any
ill
of
Mr
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
poor
thing
to
gratify
a
prejudice
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
resolve
,
for
my
part
,
not
to
depreciate
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
so
sure
of
myself
,
and
therefore
I
reserve
my
privilege
of
objecting
to
him
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
if
I
am
not
sure
of
myself
,
I
am
sure
of
you
,
Clennam
,
and
I
know
what
an
upright
man
you
are
,
and
how
much
to
be
respected
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
MY
friend
and
partner
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
shook
his
hand
in
saying
this
,
as
if
there
had
been
something
serious
at
the
bottom
of
their
conversation
;
and
they
separated
.
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
visited
the
family
on
several
occasions
,
and
had
always
observed
that
even
a
passing
allusion
to
Mr
Henry
Gowan
when
he
was
not
among
them
,
brought
back
the
cloud
which
had
obscured
Mr
Meagles
's
sunshine
on
the
morning
of
the
chance
encounter
at
the
Ferry
.
 
<EOS>
If
Clennam
had
ever
admitted
the
forbidden
passion
into
his
breast
,
this
period
might
have
been
a
period
of
real
trial
;
under
the
actual
circumstances
,
doubtless
it
was
nothing
---
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Equally
,
if
his
heart
had
given
entertainment
to
that
prohibited
guest
,
his
silent
fighting
of
his
way
through
the
mental
condition
of
this
period
might
have
been
a
little
meritorious
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
constant
effort
not
to
be
betrayed
into
a
new
phase
of
the
besetting
sin
of
his
experience
,
the
pursuit
of
selfish
objects
by
low
and
small
means
,
and
to
hold
instead
to
some
high
principle
of
honour
and
generosity
,
there
might
have
been
a
little
merit
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
resolution
not
even
to
avoid
Mr
Meagles
's
house
,
lest
,
in
the
selfish
sparing
of
himself
,
he
should
bring
any
slight
distress
upon
the
daughter
through
making
her
the
cause
of
an
estrangement
which
he
believed
the
father
would
regret
,
there
might
have
been
a
little
merit
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
modest
truthfulness
of
always
keeping
in
view
the
greater
equality
of
Mr
Gowan
's
years
and
the
greater
attractions
of
his
person
and
manner
,
there
might
have
been
a
little
merit
.
 
<EOS>
In
doing
all
this
and
much
more
,
in
a
perfectly
unaffected
way
and
with
a
manful
and
composed
constancy
,
while
the
pain
within
him
(
peculiar
as
his
life
and
history
)
was
very
sharp
,
there
might
have
been
some
quiet
strength
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
after
the
resolution
he
had
made
,
of
course
he
could
have
no
such
merits
as
these
;
and
such
a
state
of
mind
was
nobody
's
---
nobody
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gowan
made
it
no
concern
of
his
whether
it
was
nobody
's
or
somebody
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
preserved
his
perfect
serenity
of
manner
on
all
occasions
,
as
if
the
possibility
of
Clennam
's
presuming
to
have
debated
the
great
question
were
too
distant
and
ridiculous
to
be
imagined
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
always
an
affability
to
bestow
on
Clennam
and
an
ease
to
treat
him
with
,
which
might
of
itself
(
in
the
supposititious
case
of
his
not
having
taken
that
sagacious
course
)
have
been
a
very
uncomfortable
element
in
his
state
of
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
quite
regret
you
were
not
with
us
yesterday
,
"
said
Mr
Henry
Gowan
,
calling
on
Clennam
the
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
an
agreeable
day
up
the
river
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
he
had
heard
,
Arthur
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
your
partner
?
"
returned
Henry
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
dear
old
fellow
he
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
,
he
is
the
finest
creature
!
"
said
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
fresh
,
so
green
,
trusts
in
such
wonderful
things
!
"
   
<EOS>
Here
was
one
of
the
many
little
rough
points
that
had
a
tendency
to
grate
on
Clennam
's
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
it
aside
by
merely
repeating
that
he
had
a
high
regard
for
Mr
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
charming
!
 
<EOS>
To
see
him
mooning
along
to
that
time
of
life
,
laying
down
nothing
by
the
way
and
picking
up
nothing
by
the
way
,
is
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
It
warms
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
So
unspoilt
,
so
simple
,
such
a
good
soul
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
Mr
Clennam
,
one
feels
desperately
worldly
and
wicked
in
comparison
with
such
an
innocent
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
for
myself
,
let
me
add
,
without
including
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
genuine
also
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
for
the
compliment
,
"
said
Clennam
,
ill
at
ease
;
"
you
are
too
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
so
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
candid
with
you
,
tolerably
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
great
impostor
.
 
<EOS>
Buy
one
of
my
pictures
,
and
I
assure
you
,
in
confidence
,
it
will
not
be
worth
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
Buy
one
of
another
man
's
---
any
great
professor
who
beats
me
hollow
---
and
the
chances
are
that
the
more
you
give
him
,
the
more
he
'll
impose
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
do
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
All
painters
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Painters
,
writers
,
patriots
,
all
the
rest
who
have
stands
in
the
market
.
 
<EOS>
Give
almost
any
man
I
know
ten
pounds
,
and
he
will
impose
upon
you
to
a
corresponding
extent
;
a
thousand
pounds
---
to
a
corresponding
extent
;
ten
thousand
pounds
---
to
a
corresponding
extent
.
 
<EOS>
So
great
the
success
,
so
great
the
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
a
capital
world
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Gowan
with
warm
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
jolly
,
excellent
,
lovable
world
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
rather
thought
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
that
the
principle
you
mention
was
chiefly
acted
on
by
---
"
   
"
By
the
Barnacles
?
<EOS>
"
interrupted
Gowan
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
political
gentlemen
who
condescend
to
keep
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
hard
upon
the
Barnacles
,
"
said
Gowan
,
laughing
afresh
,
"
they
are
darling
fellows
!
 
<EOS>
Even
poor
little
Clarence
,
the
born
idiot
of
the
family
,
is
the
most
agreeable
and
most
endearing
blockhead
!
 
<EOS>
And
by
Jupiter
,
with
a
kind
of
cleverness
in
him
too
that
would
astonish
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
.
 
<EOS>
Very
much
,
"
said
Clennam
,
drily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
after
all
,
"
cried
Gowan
,
with
that
characteristic
balancing
of
his
which
reduced
everything
in
the
wide
world
to
the
same
light
weight
,
"
though
I
ca
n't
deny
that
the
Circumlocution
Office
may
ultimately
shipwreck
everybody
and
everything
,
still
,
that
will
probably
not
be
in
our
time
---
and
it
's
a
school
for
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
dangerous
,
unsatisfactory
,
and
expensive
school
to
the
people
who
pay
to
keep
the
pupils
there
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Clennam
,
shaking
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
terrible
fellow
,
"
returned
Gowan
,
airily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
understand
how
you
have
frightened
that
little
donkey
,
Clarence
,
the
most
estimable
of
moon
-
calves
(
I
really
love
him
)
nearly
out
of
his
wits
.
 
<EOS>
But
enough
of
him
,
and
of
all
the
rest
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
present
you
to
my
mother
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
me
the
favour
to
give
me
the
opportunity
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
nobody
's
state
of
mind
,
there
was
nothing
Clennam
would
have
desired
less
,
or
would
have
been
more
at
a
loss
how
to
avoid
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
mother
lives
in
a
most
primitive
manner
down
in
that
dreary
red
-
brick
dungeon
at
Hampton
Court
,
"
said
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
make
your
own
appointment
,
suggest
your
own
day
for
permitting
me
to
take
you
there
to
dinner
,
you
would
be
bored
and
she
would
be
charmed
.
 
<EOS>
Really
that
's
the
state
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
What
could
Clennam
say
after
this
?
 
<EOS>
His
retiring
character
included
a
great
deal
that
was
simple
in
the
best
sense
,
because
unpractised
and
unused
;
and
in
his
simplicity
and
modesty
,
he
could
only
say
that
he
was
happy
to
place
himself
at
Mr
Gowan
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
said
it
,
and
the
day
was
fixed
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
dreaded
day
it
was
on
his
part
,
and
a
very
unwelcome
day
when
it
came
<EOS>
and
they
went
down
to
Hampton
Court
together
.
   
<EOS>
The
venerable
inhabitants
of
that
venerable
pile
seemed
,
in
those
times
,
to
be
encamped
there
like
a
sort
of
civilised
gipsies
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
temporary
air
about
their
establishments
,
as
if
they
were
going
away
the
moment
they
could
get
anything
better
;
there
was
also
a
dissatisfied
air
about
themselves
,
as
if
they
took
it
very
ill
that
they
had
not
already
got
something
much
better
.
<EOS>
Genteel
blinds
and
makeshifts
were
more
or
less
observable
as
soon
as
their
doors
were
opened
;
screens
not
half
high
enough
,
which
made
dining
-
rooms
out
of
arched
passages
,
and
warded
off
obscure
corners
where
footboys
slept
at
nights
with
their
heads
among
the
knives
and
forks
;
<EOS>
curtains
which
called
upon
you
to
believe
that
they
did
n't
hide
anything
;
panes
of
glass
which
requested
you
not
to
see
them
;
many
objects
of
various
forms
,
feigning
to
have
no
connection
with
their
guilty
secret
,
a
bed
;
disguised
traps
in
walls
,
which
were
clearly
coal
-
cellars
;
affectations
of
no
thoroughfares
,
which
were
evidently
doors
to
little
kitchens
.
<EOS>
Mental
reservations
and
artful
mysteries
grew
out
of
these
things
.
<EOS>
Callers
looking
steadily
into
the
eyes
of
their
receivers
,
pretended
not
to
smell
cooking
three
feet
off
;
people
,
confronting
closets
accidentally
left
open
,
pretended
not
to
see
bottles
;
visitors
with
their
heads
against
a
partition
of
thin
canvas
,
and
a
page
and
a
young
female
at
high
words
on
the
other
side
,
made
believe
to
be
sitting
in
a
primeval
silence
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
end
to
the
small
social
accommodation
-
bills
of
this
nature
which
the
gipsies
of
gentility
were
constantly
drawing
upon
,
and
accepting
for
,
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
Some
of
these
Bohemians
were
of
an
irritable
temperament
,
as
constantly
soured
and
vexed
by
two
mental
trials
:
<EOS>
the
first
,
the
consciousness
that
they
had
never
got
enough
out
of
the
public
;
the
second
,
the
consciousness
that
the
public
were
admitted
into
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
latter
great
wrong
,
a
few
suffered
dreadfully
---
particularly
on
Sundays
,
when
they
had
for
some
time
expected
the
earth
to
open
and
swallow
the
public
up
;
but
which
desirable
event
had
not
yet
occurred
,
in
consequence
of
some
reprehensible
laxity
in
the
arrangements
of
the
Universe
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
's
door
was
attended
by
a
family
servant
of
several
years
'
standing
,
who
had
his
own
crow
to
pluck
with
the
public
concerning
a
situation
in
the
Post
-
Office
which
he
had
been
for
some
time
expecting
,
and
to
which
he
was
not
yet
appointed
.
 
<EOS>
He
perfectly
knew
that
the
public
could
never
have
got
him
in
,
but
he
grimly
gratified
himself
with
the
idea
that
the
public
kept
him
out
.
<EOS>
Under
the
influence
of
this
injury
(
and
perhaps
of
some
little
straitness
and
irregularity
in
the
matter
of
wages
)
,
he
had
grown
neglectful
of
his
person
and
morose
in
mind
;
and
now
beholding
in
Clennam
one
of
the
degraded
body
of
his
oppressors
,
received
him
with
ignominy
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
,
however
,
received
him
with
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
her
a
courtly
old
lady
,
formerly
a
Beauty
,
and
still
sufficiently
well
-
favoured
to
have
dispensed
with
the
powder
on
her
nose
and
a
certain
impossible
bloom
under
each
eye
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
lofty
with
him
;
so
was
another
old
lady
,
dark
-
browed
and
high
-
nosed
,
and
who
must
have
had
something
real
about
her
<EOS>
or
she
could
not
have
existed
,
but
it
was
certainly
not
her
hair
or
her
teeth
or
her
figure
or
her
complexion
;
so
was
a
grey
old
gentleman
of
dignified
and
sullen
appearance
;
both
of
whom
had
come
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
they
had
all
been
in
the
British
Embassy
way
in
sundry
parts
of
the
earth
,
and
as
a
British
Embassy
can
not
better
establish
a
character
with
the
Circumlocution
Office
than
by
treating
its
compatriots
with
illimitable
contempt
(
else
it
would
become
like
the
Embassies
of
other
countries
)
,
Clennam
felt
that
on
the
whole
they
let
him
off
lightly
.
   
<EOS>
The
dignified
old
gentleman
turned
out
to
be
Lord
Lancaster
Stiltstalking
,
who
had
been
maintained
by
the
Circumlocution
Office
for
many
years
as
a
representative
of
the
Britannic
Majesty
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
This
noble
Refrigerator
had
iced
several
European
courts
in
his
time
,
and
had
done
it
with
such
complete
success
that
the
very
name
of
Englishman
yet
struck
cold
to
the
stomachs
of
foreigners
who
had
the
distinguished
honour
of
remembering
him
at
a
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
now
in
retirement
,
and
hence
(
in
a
ponderous
white
cravat
,
like
a
stiff
snow
-
drift
)
was
so
obliging
as
to
shade
the
dinner
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
whisper
of
the
pervading
Bohemian
character
in
the
nomadic
nature
of
the
service
and
its
curious
races
of
plates
and
dishes
;
but
the
noble
Refrigerator
,
infinitely
better
than
plate
or
porcelain
,
made
it
superb
.
 
<EOS>
He
shaded
the
dinner
,
cooled
the
wines
,
chilled
the
gravy
,
and
blighted
the
vegetables
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
other
person
in
the
room
:
a
microscopically
small
footboy
,
who
waited
on
the
malevolent
man
who
had
n't
got
into
the
Post
-
Office
.
 
<EOS>
Even
this
youth
,
if
his
jacket
could
have
been
unbuttoned
and
his
heart
laid
bare
,
would
have
been
seen
,
as
a
distant
adherent
of
the
Barnacle
family
,
already
to
aspire
to
a
situation
under
Government
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
with
a
gentle
melancholy
upon
her
,
occasioned
by
her
son
's
being
reduced
to
court
the
swinish
public
as
a
follower
of
the
low
Arts
,
instead
of
asserting
his
birthright
and
putting
a
ring
through
its
nose
as
an
acknowledged
Barnacle
,
headed
the
conversation
at
dinner
on
the
evil
days
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
Clennam
learned
for
the
first
time
what
little
pivots
this
great
world
goes
round
upon
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
John
Barnacle
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
after
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
had
been
fully
ascertained
,
"
if
John
Barnacle
had
but
abandoned
his
most
unfortunate
idea
of
conciliating
the
mob
,
all
would
have
been
well
,
and
<EOS>
I
think
the
country
would
have
been
preserved
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
old
lady
with
the
high
nose
assented
;
but
added
that
if
Augustus
Stiltstalking
had
in
a
general
way
ordered
the
cavalry
out
with
instructions
to
charge
,
she
thought
the
country
would
have
been
preserved
.
   
<EOS>
The
noble
Refrigerator
assented
;
but
added
that
if
William
Barnacle
and
Tudor
Stiltstalking
,
when
they
came
over
to
one
another
and
formed
their
ever
-
memorable
coalition
,
had
boldly
muzzled
the
newspapers
,
and
rendered
it
penal
for
any
Editor
-
person
to
presume
to
discuss
the
conduct
of
any
appointed
authority
abroad
or
at
home
,
he
thought
the
country
would
have
been
preserved
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
that
the
country
(
another
word
for
the
Barnacles
and
Stiltstalkings
)
wanted
preserving
,
but
how
it
came
to
want
preserving
was
not
so
clear
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
clear
that
the
question
was
all
about
John
Barnacle
,
Augustus
Stiltstalking
,
William
Barnacle
and
Tudor
Stiltstalking
,
Tom
,
Dick
,
or
Harry
Barnacle
or
Stiltstalking
,
because
there
was
nobody
else
but
mob
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
feature
of
the
conversation
which
impressed
Clennam
,
as
a
man
not
used
to
it
,
very
disagreeably
:
making
him
doubt
if
it
were
quite
right
to
sit
there
,
silently
hearing
a
great
nation
narrowed
to
such
little
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
Remembering
,
however
,
that
in
the
Parliamentary
debates
,
whether
on
the
life
of
that
nation
's
body
or
the
life
of
its
soul
,
the
question
was
usually
all
about
and
between
John
Barnacle
,
Augustus
Stiltstalking
,
William
Barnacle
and
Tudor
Stiltstalking
,
Tom
,
Dick
,
or
Harry
Barnacle
or
Stiltstalking
,
and
nobody
else
;
he
said
nothing
on
the
part
of
mob
,
bethinking
himself
that
mob
was
used
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Henry
Gowan
seemed
to
have
a
malicious
pleasure
in
playing
off
the
three
talkers
against
each
other
,
and
in
seeing
Clennam
startled
by
what
they
said
.
 
<EOS>
Having
as
supreme
a
contempt
for
the
class
that
had
thrown
him
off
as
for
the
class
that
had
not
taken
him
on
,
he
had
no
personal
disquiet
in
anything
that
passed
.
 
<EOS>
His
healthy
state
of
mind
appeared
even
to
derive
a
gratification
from
Clennam
's
position
of
embarrassment
and
isolation
among
the
good
company
;
and
if
Clennam
had
been
in
that
condition
with
which
Nobody
was
incessantly
contending
,
he
would
have
suspected
it
,
and
would
have
struggled
with
the
suspicion
as
a
meanness
,
even
while
he
sat
at
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
a
couple
of
hours
the
noble
Refrigerator
,
at
no
time
less
than
a
hundred
years
behind
the
period
,
got
about
five
centuries
in
arrears
,
and
delivered
solemn
political
oracles
appropriate
to
that
epoch
.
 
<EOS>
He
finished
by
freezing
a
cup
of
tea
for
his
own
drinking
,
and
retiring
at
his
lowest
temperature
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mrs
Gowan
,
who
had
been
accustomed
in
her
days
of
a
vacant
arm
-
chair
beside
her
to
which
to
summon
state
to
retain
her
devoted
slaves
,
one
by
one
,
for
short
audiences
as
marks
of
her
especial
favour
,
invited
Clennam
with
a
turn
of
her
fan
to
approach
the
presence
.
 
<EOS>
He
obeyed
,
and
took
the
tripod
recently
vacated
by
Lord
Lancaster
Stiltstalking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
"
apart
from
the
happiness
I
have
in
becoming
known
to
you
,
though
in
this
odiously
inconvenient
place
---
a
mere
barrack
---
there
is
a
subject
on
which
I
am
dying
to
speak
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
subject
in
connection
with
which
my
son
first
had
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
the
pleasure
of
cultivating
your
acquaintance
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
inclined
his
head
,
as
a
generally
suitable
reply
to
what
he
did
not
yet
quite
understand
.
   
<EOS>
"
First
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
"
now
,
is
she
really
pretty
?
"
   
<EOS>
In
nobody
's
difficulties
,
he
would
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
answer
;
very
difficult
indeed
to
smile
,
and
say
"
Who
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
!
<EOS>
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
flame
of
Henry
's
.
 
<EOS>
This
unfortunate
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
If
it
is
a
point
of
honour
that
I
should
originate
the
name
---
Miss
Mickles
---
Miggles
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Meagles
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
is
very
beautiful
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Men
are
so
often
mistaken
on
those
points
,
"
returned
Mrs
Gowan
,
shaking
her
head
,
"
that
I
candidly
confess
to
you
<EOS>
I
feel
anything
but
sure
of
it
,
even
now
;
though
it
is
something
to
have
Henry
corroborated
with
so
much
gravity
and
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
He
picked
the
people
up
at
Rome
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
phrase
would
have
given
nobody
mortal
offence
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
replied
,
"
Excuse
me
,
I
doubt
if
I
understand
your
expression
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Picked
the
people
up
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
tapping
the
sticks
of
her
closed
fan
(
a
large
green
one
,
which
she
used
as
a
hand
-
screen
)
on
her
little
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Came
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
Found
them
out
.
 
<EOS>
Stumbled
UP
against
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
people
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
The
Miggles
people
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
can
not
say
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
where
my
friend
Mr
Meagles
first
presented
Mr
Henry
Gowan
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
pretty
sure
he
picked
her
up
at
Rome
;
but
never
mind
where
---
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Now
(
this
is
entirely
between
ourselves
)
,
is
she
very
plebeian
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Clennam
,
"
<EOS>
I
am
so
undoubtedly
plebeian
myself
,
that
I
do
not
feel
qualified
to
judge
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
neat
!
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
coolly
unfurling
her
screen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
happy
!
 
<EOS>
From
which
I
infer
that
you
secretly
think
her
manner
equal
to
her
looks
?
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
,
after
a
moment
's
stiffness
,
bowed
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
comforting
,
and
I
hope
you
may
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
Did
Henry
tell
me
you
had
travelled
with
them
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
travelled
with
my
friend
Mr
Meagles
,
and
his
wife
and
daughter
,
during
some
months
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Nobody
's
heart
might
have
been
wrung
by
the
remembrance
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
comforting
,
because
you
must
have
had
a
large
experience
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
Mr
Clennam
,
this
thing
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time
,
and
I
find
no
improvement
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
to
have
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
one
so
well
informed
about
it
as
yourself
,
is
an
immense
relief
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
a
boon
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
a
blessing
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Pardon
me
,
"
returned
Clennam
,
"
but
I
am
not
in
Mr
Henry
Gowan
's
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
far
from
being
so
well
informed
as
you
suppose
me
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mistake
makes
my
position
a
very
delicate
one
.
 
<EOS>
No
word
on
this
topic
has
ever
passed
between
Mr
Henry
Gowan
and
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
glanced
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
where
her
son
was
playing
ecarte
on
a
sofa
,
with
the
old
lady
who
was
for
a
charge
of
cavalry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
in
his
confidence
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
word
has
passed
between
you
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
are
unexpressed
confidences
,
Mr
Clennam
;
and
as
you
have
been
together
intimately
among
these
people
,
I
can
not
doubt
that
a
confidence
of
that
sort
exists
in
the
present
case
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
have
heard
that
I
have
suffered
the
keenest
distress
of
mind
from
<EOS>
Henry
's
having
taken
to
a
pursuit
which
---
well
!
"
<EOS>
shrugging
her
shoulders
,
"
a
very
respectable
pursuit
,
I
dare
say
,
and
some
artists
are
,
as
artists
,
quite
superior
persons
;
still
,
we
never
yet
in
our
family
have
gone
beyond
an
Amateur
,
and
it
is
a
pardonable
weakness
to
feel
a
little
---
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mrs
Gowan
broke
off
to
heave
a
sigh
,
<EOS>
Clennam
,
however
resolute
to
be
magnanimous
,
could
not
keep
down
the
thought
that
there
was
mighty
little
danger
of
the
family
's
ever
going
beyond
an
Amateur
,
even
as
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Henry
,
"
the
mother
resumed
,
"
is
self
-
willed
and
resolute
;
and
as
these
people
naturally
strain
every
nerve
to
catch
him
,
I
can
entertain
very
little
hope
,
Mr
Clennam
,
that
the
thing
will
be
broken
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
apprehend
the
girl
's
fortune
will
be
very
small
;
Henry
might
have
done
much
better
;
there
is
scarcely
anything
to
compensate
for
the
connection
:
still
,
he
acts
for
himself
;
and
if
I
find
no
improvement
within
a
short
time
,
I
see
no
other
course
than
to
resign
myself
and
make
the
best
of
these
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
infinitely
obliged
to
you
for
what
you
have
told
me
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
Clennam
stiffly
bowed
again
.
 
<EOS>
With
an
uneasy
flush
upon
his
face
,
and
hesitation
in
his
manner
,
he
then
said
in
a
still
lower
tone
than
he
had
adopted
yet
:
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Gowan
,
I
scarcely
know
how
to
acquit
myself
of
what
I
feel
to
be
a
duty
,
and
yet
I
must
ask
you
for
your
kind
consideration
in
attempting
to
discharge
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
misconception
on
your
part
,
a
very
great
misconception
if
I
may
venture
to
call
it
so
,
seems
to
require
setting
right
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
supposed
Mr
Meagles
and
his
family
to
strain
every
nerve
,
I
think
you
said
---
"
   
"
Every
nerve
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Gowan
,
looking
at
him
in
calm
obstinacy
,
with
her
green
fan
between
her
face
and
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
secure
Mr
Henry
Gowan
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
placidly
assented
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
that
is
so
far
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
from
being
the
case
,
that
I
know
Mr
Meagles
to
be
unhappy
in
this
matter
;
and
to
have
interposed
all
reasonable
obstacles
with
the
hope
of
putting
an
end
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
shut
up
her
great
green
fan
,
tapped
him
on
the
arm
with
it
,
and
tapped
her
smiling
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
watched
her
face
for
some
explanation
of
what
she
did
mean
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
really
serious
,
Mr
Clennam
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
?
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
did
not
see
;
and
said
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
do
n't
I
know
my
son
,
and
do
n't
I
know
that
this
is
exactly
the
way
to
hold
him
?
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
contemptuously
;
"
and
do
not
these
Miggles
people
know
it
,
at
least
as
well
as
I
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
shrewd
people
,
Mr
Clennam
:
evidently
people
of
business
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Miggles
belonged
to
a
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
It
ought
to
have
been
a
very
profitable
Bank
,
if
he
had
much
to
do
with
its
management
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
very
well
done
,
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
and
entreat
you
,
ma'am
---
<EOS>
"
Arthur
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
Clennam
,
can
you
really
be
so
credulous
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
made
such
a
painful
impression
upon
him
to
hear
her
talking
in
this
haughty
tone
,
and
to
see
her
patting
her
contemptuous
lips
with
her
fan
,
that
he
said
very
earnestly
,
"
Believe
me
,
ma'am
,
this
is
unjust
,
a
perfectly
groundless
suspicion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Suspicion
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
suspicion
,
Mr
Clennam
,
Certainty
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
knowingly
done
indeed
,
and
seems
to
have
taken
YOU
in
completely
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
laughed
;
and
again
sat
tapping
her
lips
with
her
fan
,
and
tossing
her
head
,
as
if
she
added
,
"
Do
n't
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
such
people
will
do
anything
for
the
honour
of
such
an
alliance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
opportune
moment
,
the
cards
were
thrown
up
,
and
Mr
Henry
Gowan
came
across
the
room
saying
,
"
Mother
,
if
you
can
spare
Mr
Clennam
for
this
time
,
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
,
and
it
's
getting
late
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
thereupon
rose
,
as
he
had
no
choice
but
to
do
;
and
Mrs
Gowan
showed
him
,
to
the
last
,
the
same
look
and
the
same
tapped
contemptuous
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
a
portentously
long
audience
of
my
mother
,
"
said
Gowan
,
as
the
door
closed
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fervently
hope
she
has
not
bored
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
a
little
open
phaeton
for
the
journey
,
and
were
soon
in
it
on
the
road
home
.
 
<EOS>
Gowan
,
driving
,
lighted
a
cigar
;
Clennam
declined
one
.
 
<EOS>
Do
what
he
would
,
he
fell
into
such
a
mood
of
abstraction
that
Gowan
said
again
,
"
I
am
very
much
afraid
my
mother
has
bored
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
he
roused
himself
to
answer
,
"
Not
at
all
!
"
and
soon
relapsed
again
.
   
<EOS>
In
that
state
of
mind
which
rendered
nobody
uneasy
,
his
thoughtfulness
would
have
turned
principally
on
the
man
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
thought
of
the
morning
when
he
first
saw
him
rooting
out
the
stones
with
his
heel
,
and
would
have
asked
himself
,
"
Does
he
jerk
me
out
of
the
path
in
the
same
careless
,
cruel
way
?
<EOS>
"
He
would
have
thought
,
had
this
introduction
to
his
mother
been
brought
about
by
him
because
he
knew
what
she
would
say
,
and
that
he
could
thus
place
his
position
before
a
rival
and
loftily
warn
him
off
,
without
himself
reposing
a
word
of
confidence
in
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
thought
,
even
if
there
were
no
such
design
as
that
,
had
he
brought
him
there
to
play
with
his
repressed
emotions
,
and
torment
him
?
 
<EOS>
The
current
of
these
meditations
would
have
been
stayed
sometimes
by
a
rush
of
shame
,
bearing
a
remonstrance
to
himself
from
his
own
open
nature
,
representing
that
to
shelter
such
suspicions
,
even
for
the
passing
moment
,
was
not
to
hold
the
high
,
unenvious
course
he
had
resolved
to
keep
.
 
<EOS>
At
those
times
,
the
striving
within
him
would
have
been
hardest
;
and
looking
up
and
catching
Gowan
's
eyes
,
he
would
have
started
as
if
he
had
done
him
an
injury
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
looking
at
the
dark
road
and
its
uncertain
objects
,
he
would
have
gradually
trailed
off
again
into
thinking
,
"
Where
are
we
driving
,
he
and
I
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
on
the
darker
road
of
life
?
 
<EOS>
How
will
it
be
with
us
,
and
with
her
,
in
the
obscure
distance
?
"
 
<EOS>
Thinking
of
her
<EOS>
,
he
would
have
been
troubled
anew
with
a
reproachful
misgiving
that
it
was
not
even
loyal
to
her
to
dislike
him
,
and
that
in
being
so
easily
prejudiced
against
him
he
was
less
deserving
of
her
than
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
evidently
out
of
spirits
,
"
said
Gowan
;
"
I
am
very
much
afraid
my
mother
must
have
bored
you
dreadfully
.
"
<EOS>
"
Believe
me
,
not
at
all
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
---
nothing
!

Five
-
and

Twenty
 
A
frequently
recurring
doubt
,
whether
Mr
Pancks
's
desire
to
collect
information
relative
to
the
Dorrit
family
could
have
any
possible
bearing
on
the
misgivings
he
had
imparted
to
his
mother
on
his
return
from
his
long
exile
,
caused
Arthur
Clennam
much
uneasiness
at
this
period
.
 
<EOS>
What
Mr
Pancks
already
knew
about
the
Dorrit
family
,
what
more
he
really
wanted
to
find
out
,
and
why
he
should
trouble
his
busy
head
about
them
at
all
,
were
questions
that
often
perplexed
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
was
not
a
man
to
waste
his
time
and
trouble
in
researches
prompted
by
idle
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
a
specific
object
Clennam
could
not
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
And
whether
the
attainment
of
that
object
by
Mr
Pancks
's
industry
might
bring
to
light
,
in
some
untimely
way
,
secret
reasons
which
had
induced
his
mother
to
take
Little
Dorrit
by
the
hand
,
was
a
serious
speculation
.
   
<EOS>
Not
that
he
ever
wavered
either
in
his
desire
or
his
determination
to
repair
a
wrong
that
had
been
done
in
his
father
's
time
,
should
a
wrong
come
to
light
,
and
be
reparable
.
 
<EOS>
The
shadow
of
a
supposed
act
of
injustice
,
which
had
hung
over
him
since
his
father
's
death
,
was
so
vague
and
formless
that
it
might
be
the
result
of
a
reality
widely
remote
from
his
idea
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
his
apprehensions
should
prove
to
be
well
founded
,
he
was
ready
at
any
moment
to
lay
down
all
he
had
,
and
begin
the
world
anew
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
fierce
dark
teaching
of
his
childhood
had
never
sunk
into
his
heart
,
so
that
first
article
in
his
code
of
morals
was
,
that
he
must
begin
,
in
practical
humility
,
with
looking
well
to
his
feet
on
Earth
,
and
that
he
could
never
mount
on
wings
of
words
to
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
Duty
on
earth
,
restitution
on
earth
,
action
on
earth
;
these
first
,
as
the
first
steep
steps
upward
.
 
<EOS>
Strait
was
the
gate
and
narrow
<EOS>
was
the
way
;
far
straiter
and
narrower
than
the
broad
high
road
paved
with
vain
professions
and
vain
repetitions
,
motes
from
other
men
's
eyes
and
liberal
delivery
of
others
to
the
judgment
---
all
cheap
materials
costing
absolutely
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
selfish
fear
or
hesitation
that
rendered
him
uneasy
,
but
a
mistrust
lest
Pancks
might
not
observe
his
part
of
the
understanding
between
them
,
and
,
making
any
discovery
,
<EOS>
might
take
some
course
upon
it
without
imparting
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
when
he
recalled
his
conversation
with
Pancks
,
and
the
little
reason
he
had
to
suppose
that
there
was
any
likelihood
of
that
strange
personage
being
on
that
track
at
all
,
there
were
times
when
he
wondered
that
he
made
so
much
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Labouring
in
this
sea
,
as
all
barks
labour
in
cross
seas
,
he
tossed
about
and
came
to
no
haven
.
   
<EOS>
The
removal
of
Little
Dorrit
herself
from
their
customary
association
,
did
not
mend
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
much
out
,
and
so
much
in
her
own
room
,
that
he
began
to
miss
her
and
to
find
a
blank
in
her
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
written
to
her
to
inquire
if
she
were
better
,
and
she
had
written
back
,
very
gratefully
and
earnestly
telling
him
not
to
be
uneasy
on
her
behalf
,
for
she
was
quite
well
;
but
he
had
not
seen
her
,
for
what
,
in
their
intercourse
,
was
a
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
He
returned
home
one
evening
from
an
interview
with
her
father
,
who
had
mentioned
that
she
was
out
visiting
---
which
was
what
he
always
said
when
she
was
hard
at
work
to
buy
his
supper
---
and
found
Mr
Meagles
in
an
excited
state
walking
up
and
down
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
opening
the
door
,
Mr
Meagles
stopped
,
faced
round
,
and
said
:
   
"
Clennam
!
---
Tattycoram
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lost
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
my
heart
alive
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Clennam
in
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Would
n't
count
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
sir
;
could
n't
be
got
to
do
it
;
stopped
at
eight
,
and
took
herself
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Left
your
house
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
to
come
back
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
that
girl
's
passionate
and
proud
character
.
 
<EOS>
A
team
of
horses
could
n't
draw
her
back
now
;
the
bolts
and
bars
of
the
old
Bastille
could
n't
keep
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
it
happen
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
and
tell
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
how
it
happened
,
it
's
not
so
easy
to
relate
:
because
you
must
have
the
unfortunate
temperament
of
the
poor
impetuous
girl
herself
,
before
you
can
fully
understand
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
came
about
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
Pet
and
Mother
<EOS>
and
I
have
been
having
a
good
deal
of
talk
together
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
disguise
from
you
,
Clennam
,
that
those
conversations
have
not
been
of
as
bright
a
kind
as
I
could
wish
;
they
have
referred
to
our
going
away
again
.
 
<EOS>
In
proposing
to
do
which
,
I
have
had
,
in
fact
,
an
object
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
's
heart
beat
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
object
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
that
I
will
not
disguise
from
you
,
either
,
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
an
inclination
on
the
part
of
my
dear
child
which
I
am
sorry
for
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
guess
the
person
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
Gowan
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
unprepared
to
hear
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
"
I
wish
to
God
you
had
never
had
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
so
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
and
<EOS>
I
have
done
all
we
could
to
get
the
better
of
it
,
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
tried
tender
advice
,
we
have
tried
time
,
we
have
tried
absence
.
 
<EOS>
As
yet
,
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
Our
late
conversations
have
been
upon
the
subject
of
going
away
for
another
year
at
least
,
in
order
that
there
might
be
an
entire
separation
and
breaking
off
for
that
term
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
question
,
Pet
has
been
unhappy
,
and
therefore
Mother
and
I
have
been
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Clennam
said
that
he
could
easily
believe
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
continued
Mr
Meagles
in
an
apologetic
way
,
"
I
admit
as
a
practical
man
,
and
I
am
sure
Mother
would
admit
as
a
practical
woman
,
that
we
do
,
in
families
,
magnify
our
troubles
and
make
mountains
of
our
molehills
in
a
way
that
is
calculated
to
be
rather
trying
to
people
who
look
on
---
to
mere
outsiders
,
you
know
,
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
Still
,
Pet
's
happiness
or
unhappiness
is
quite
a
life
or
death
question
with
us
;
and
we
may
be
excused
,
I
hope
,
for
making
much
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
it
might
have
been
borne
by
Tattycoram
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
indeed
think
so
,
"
returned
Clennam
,
in
most
emphatic
recognition
of
this
very
moderate
expectation
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
shaking
his
head
ruefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
could
n't
stand
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
chafing
and
firing
of
that
girl
,
the
wearing
and
tearing
of
that
girl
within
her
own
breast
,
has
been
such
that
I
have
softly
said
to
her
again
and
again
in
passing
her
,
"
Five
-
and
-
twenty
,
Tattycoram
,
five
-
and
-
twenty
!
<EOS>
"
I
heartily
wish
she
could
have
gone
on
counting
five
-
and
-
twenty
day
and
night
,
and
then
it
would
n't
have
happened
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
with
a
despondent
countenance
in
which
the
goodness
of
his
heart
was
even
more
expressed
than
in
his
times
of
cheerfulness
and
gaiety
,
stroked
his
face
down
from
his
forehead
to
his
chin
,
and
shook
his
head
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
to
Mother
(
not
that
it
was
necessary
,
for
she
would
have
thought
it
all
for
herself
)
,
we
are
practical
people
,
my
dear
,
and
we
know
her
story
;
we
see
in
this
unhappy
girl
some
reflection
of
what
was
raging
in
her
mother
's
heart
before
ever
such
a
creature
as
this
poor
thing
was
in
the
world
;
we
'll
gloss
her
temper
over
,
Mother
<EOS>
,
we
wo
n't
notice
it
at
present
,
my
dear
,
we
'll
take
advantage
of
some
better
disposition
in
her
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
do
what
we
would
,
it
seems
as
if
it
was
to
be
;
she
broke
out
violently
one
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
,
and
why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
ask
me
Why
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
a
little
disturbed
by
the
question
,
for
<EOS>
he
was
far
more
intent
on
softening
her
case
than
the
family
's
,
"
I
can
only
refer
you
to
what
I
have
just
repeated
as
having
been
pretty
near
my
words
to
Mother
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
How
,
we
had
said
Good
night
to
Pet
in
her
presence
(
very
affectionately
,
I
must
allow
)
,
and
she
had
attended
Pet
up
-
stairs
---
<EOS>
you
remember
she
was
her
maid
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
Pet
,
having
been
out
of
sorts
,
may
have
been
a
little
more
inconsiderate
than
usual
in
requiring
services
of
her
:
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
any
right
to
say
so
;
she
was
always
thoughtful
and
gentle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
gentlest
mistress
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Clennam
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
;
"
you
have
often
seen
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
We
presently
heard
this
unfortunate
Tattycoram
loud
and
angry
,
and
before
we
could
ask
what
was
the
matter
,
Pet
came
back
in
a
tremble
,
saying
she
was
frightened
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Close
after
her
came
Tattycoram
in
a
flaming
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hate
you
all
three
,
"
says
she
,
stamping
her
foot
at
us
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
bursting
with
hate
of
the
whole
house
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
Upon
which
you
---
?
"
   
"
I
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
with
a
plain
good
faith
that
might
have
commanded
the
belief
of
Mrs
Gowan
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
count
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
Tattycoram
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
again
stroked
his
face
and
shook
his
head
,
with
an
air
of
profound
regret
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
so
used
to
do
it
,
Clennam
,
that
even
then
,
such
a
picture
of
passion
as
you
never
saw
,
she
stopped
short
,
looked
me
full
in
the
face
,
and
counted
(
as
I
made
out
)
to
eight
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
could
n't
control
herself
to
go
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
There
she
broke
down
,
poor
thing
,
and
gave
the
other
seventeen
to
the
four
winds
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
all
burst
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
detested
us
<EOS>
,
she
was
miserable
with
us
,
she
could
n't
bear
it
<EOS>
,
she
would
n't
bear
it
,
she
was
determined
to
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
younger
than
her
young
mistress
,
and
would
she
remain
to
see
her
always
held
up
as
the
only
creature
who
was
young
and
interesting
,
and
to
be
cherished
and
loved
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
n't
,
she
would
n't
,
she
would
n't
!
 
<EOS>
What
did
we
think
she
,
Tattycoram
,
might
have
been
if
she
had
been
caressed
and
cared
for
in
her
childhood
,
like
her
young
mistress
?
 
<EOS>
As
good
as
her
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
fifty
times
as
good
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
pretended
to
be
so
fond
of
one
another
,
we
exulted
over
her
;
that
was
what
we
did
;
we
exulted
over
her
and
shamed
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
in
the
house
did
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
They
talked
about
their
fathers
and
mothers
,
and
brothers
and
sisters
;
they
liked
to
drag
them
up
before
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Mrs
Tickit
,
only
yesterday
,
when
her
little
grandchild
was
with
her
,
had
been
amused
by
the
child
's
trying
to
call
her
<EOS>
(
Tattycoram
)
by
the
wretched
name
we
gave
her
;
and
had
laughed
at
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
who
did
n't
;
and
who
were
we
that
we
should
have
a
right
to
name
her
like
a
dog
or
a
cat
?
 
<EOS>
But
she
did
n't
care
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
take
no
more
benefits
from
us
;
she
would
fling
us
her
name
back
again
,
and
she
would
go
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
leave
us
that
minute
,
nobody
should
stop
her
,
and
we
should
never
hear
of
her
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
had
recited
all
this
with
such
a
vivid
remembrance
of
his
original
,
that
he
was
almost
as
flushed
and
hot
by
this
time
as
he
described
her
to
have
been
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
wiping
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
of
no
use
trying
reason
then
,
with
that
vehement
panting
creature
<EOS>
(
Heaven
knows
what
her
mother
's
story
must
have
been
)
;
so
I
quietly
told
her
that
she
should
not
go
at
that
late
hour
of
night
,
and
I
gave
her
MY
hand
and
took
her
to
her
room
,
and
locked
the
house
doors
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
gone
this
morning
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
no
more
of
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
,
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
hunting
about
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
have
gone
very
early
and
very
silently
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
found
no
trace
of
her
down
about
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
 
<EOS>
You
want
,
"
said
Clennam
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
"
to
see
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
assume
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
assuredly
;
I
want
to
give
her
another
chance
;
Mother
and
Pet
want
to
give
her
another
chance
;
come
!
 
<EOS>
You
yourself
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
persuasively
,
as
if
the
provocation
to
be
angry
were
not
his
own
at
all
,
"
want
to
give
the
poor
passionate
girl
another
chance
,
I
know
,
Clennam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
strange
and
hard
indeed
if
I
did
not
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
when
you
are
all
so
forgiving
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
was
going
to
ask
you
was
,
have
you
thought
of
that
Miss
Wade
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
of
her
until
I
had
pervaded
the
whole
of
our
neighbourhood
,
and
I
do
n't
know
that
I
should
have
done
so
then
but
for
finding
Mother
and
Pet
,
when
I
went
home
,
full
of
the
idea
that
Tattycoram
must
have
gone
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
of
course
,
I
recalled
what
she
said
that
day
at
dinner
when
you
were
first
with
US
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
idea
where
Miss
Wade
is
to
be
found
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
,
"
it
's
because
I
have
an
addled
jumble
of
a
notion
on
that
subject
that
you
found
me
waiting
here
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
one
of
those
odd
impressions
in
my
house
,
which
do
mysteriously
get
into
houses
sometimes
,
which
nobody
seems
to
have
picked
up
in
a
distinct
form
from
anybody
,
and
yet
which
everybody
seems
to
have
got
hold
of
loosely
from
somebody
and
let
go
again
,
that
she
lives
,
or
was
living
,
thereabouts
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
handed
him
a
slip
of
paper
,
on
which
was
written
the
name
of
one
of
the
dull
by
-
streets
in
the
Grosvenor
region
,
near
Park
Lane
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
is
no
number
,
"
said
Arthur
looking
over
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
number
,
my
dear
Clennam
?
"
returned
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
anything
!
<EOS>
The
very
name
of
the
street
may
have
been
floating
in
the
air
;
for
,
as
I
tell
you
,
none
of
my
people
can
say
where
they
got
it
from
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
's
worth
an
inquiry
;
and
as
I
would
rather
make
it
in
company
than
alone
,
and
as
you
too
were
a
fellow
-
traveller
of
that
immovable
woman
's
<EOS>
,
I
thought
perhaps
---
"
Clennam
finished
the
sentence
for
him
by
taking
up
his
hat
again
,
and
saying
he
was
ready
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
now
summer
-
time
;
a
grey
,
hot
,
dusty
evening
.
 
<EOS>
They
rode
to
the
top
of
Oxford
Street
,
and
there
alighting
,
dived
in
among
the
great
streets
of
melancholy
stateliness
,
and
the
little
streets
that
try
to
be
as
stately
and
succeed
in
being
more
melancholy
,
of
which
there
is
a
labyrinth
near
Park
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
Wildernesses
of
corner
houses
,
with
barbarous
old
porticoes
and
appurtenances
;
horrors
that
came
into
existence
under
some
wrong
-
headed
person
in
some
wrong
-
headed
time
,
still
demanding
the
blind
admiration
of
all
ensuing
generations
and
determined
to
do
so
until
they
tumbled
down
;
frowned
upon
the
twilight
.
 
<EOS>
Parasite
little
tenements
,
with
the
cramp
in
their
whole
frame
,
from
the
dwarf
hall
-
door
on
the
giant
model
of
His
Grace
's
in
the
Square
to
the
squeezed
window
of
the
boudoir
commanding
the
dunghills
in
the
Mews
,
made
the
evening
doleful
.
 
<EOS>
Rickety
dwellings
of
undoubted
fashion
,
but
of
a
capacity
to
hold
nothing
comfortably
except
a
dismal
smell
,
looked
like
the
last
result
of
the
great
mansions
'
breeding
in
-
and
-
in
;
and
,
where
their
little
supplementary
bows
and
balconies
were
supported
on
thin
iron
columns
,
seemed
to
be
scrofulously
resting
upon
crutches
.
   
<EOS>
Here
<EOS>
and
there
a
Hatchment

with
the
whole
science
of
Heraldry

it

loomed
down
upon
the
street
,
like
an
Archbishop
discoursing
on
Vanity
.
 
<EOS>
The
shops
,
few
in
number
,
made
no
show
;
for
popular
opinion
was
as
nothing
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
pastrycook
knew
who
was
on
his
books
,
and
in
that
knowledge
could
be
calm
,
with
a
few
glass
cylinders
of
dowager
peppermint
-
drops
in
his
window
,
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
ancient
specimens
of
currant
-
jelly
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
oranges
formed
the
greengrocer
's
whole
concession
to
the
vulgar
mind
.
 
<EOS>
A
single
basket
made
of
moss
,
once
containing
plovers
'
eggs
,
held
all
that
the
poulterer
had
to
say
to
the
rabble
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
in
those
streets
seemed
(
which
is
always
the
case
at
that
hour
and
season
)
to
be
gone
out
to
dinner
,
and
nobody
seemed
to
be
giving
the
dinners
they
had
gone
to
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
doorsteps
there
were
lounging
footmen
with
bright
parti
-
coloured
plumage
and
white
polls
,
like
an
extinct
race
of
monstrous
birds
;
and
butlers
,
solitary
men
of
recluse
demeanour
,
each
of
whom
appeared
distrustful
of
all
other
butlers
.
 
<EOS>
The
roll
of
carriages
in
the
Park
was
done
for
the
day
;
the
street
lamps
were
lighting
;
and
wicked
little
grooms
in
the
tightest
fitting
garments
,
with
twists
in
their
legs
answering
to
the
twists
in
their
minds
,
hung
about
in
pairs
,
chewing
straws
and
exchanging
fraudulent
secrets
.
 
<EOS>
The
spotted
dogs
who
went
out
with
the
carriages
,
and
who
were
so
associated
with
splendid
equipages
that
it
looked
like
a
condescension
in
those
animals
to
come
out
without
them
,
accompanied
helpers
to
and
fro
on
messages
.
 
<EOS>
Here
<EOS>
and
there
was
a
retiring
public
-
house
which
did
not
require
to
be
supported
on
the
shoulders
of
the
people
,
and
where
gentlemen
out
of
livery
were
not
much
wanted
.
   
<EOS>
This
last
discovery
was
made
by
the
two
friends
in
pursuing
their
inquiries
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
was
there
,
or
anywhere
,
<EOS>
known
of
such
a
person
as
Miss
Wade
,
in
connection
with
the
street
they
sought
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
parasite
streets
;
long
,
regular
,
narrow
,
dull
and
gloomy
;
like
a
brick
and
mortar
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
They
inquired
at
several
little
area
gates
,
where
a
dejected
youth
stood
spiking
his
chin
on
the
summit
of
a
precipitous
little
shoot
of
wooden
steps
,
but
could
gain
no
information
.
 
<EOS>
They
walked
up
the
street
on
one
side
of
the
way
,
and
down
it
on
the
other
,
what
time
<EOS>
two
vociferous
news
-
sellers
,
announcing
an
extraordinary
event
that
had
never
happened
and
never
would
happen
,
pitched
their
hoarse
voices
into
the
secret
chambers
;
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
they
stood
at
the
corner
from
which
they
had
begun
,
and
it
had
fallen
quite
dark
,
and
they
were
no
wiser
.
   
<EOS>
It
happened
that
in
the
street
they
had
several
times
passed
a
dingy
house
,
apparently
empty
,
with
bills
in
the
windows
,
announcing
that
it
was
to
let
.
 
<EOS>
The
bills
,
as
a
variety
in
the
funeral
procession
,
almost
amounted
to
a
decoration
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
because
they
kept
the
house
separated
in
his
mind
,
or
perhaps
because
Mr
Meagles
and
himself
had
twice
agreed
in
passing
,
"
It
is
clear
she
do
n't
live
there
,
"
Clennam
now
proposed
that
they
should
go
back
and
try
that
house
before
finally
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
agreed
,
and
back
they
went
.
   
<EOS>
They
knocked
once
,
and
they
rang
once
,
without
any
response
.
   
<EOS>
"
Empty
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
listening
.
 
<EOS>
"
Once
more
,
"
said
Clennam
,
and
knocked
again
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
knock
they
heard
a
movement
below
,
and
somebody
shuffling
up
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
The
confined
entrance
was
so
dark
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
distinctly
what
kind
of
person
opened
the
door
;
but
it
appeared
to
be
an
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
our
troubling
you
,
"
said
Clennam
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
can
you
tell
us
where
Miss
Wade
lives
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
voice
in
the
darkness
unexpectedly
replied
,
"
Lives
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
she
at
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
No
answer
coming
,
Mr
Meagles
asked
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
is
she
at
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
After
another
delay
,
"
I
suppose
she
is
,
"
said
the
voice
abruptly
;
"
you
had
better
come
in
,
and
I
'll
ask
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
"
were
summarily
shut
into
the
close
black
house
;
and
the
figure
rustling
away
,
and
speaking
from
a
higher
level
,
said
,
"
Come
up
,
if
you
please
;
you
ca
n't
tumble
over
anything
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
groped
their
way
up
-
stairs
towards
a
faint
light
,
which
proved
to
be
the
light
of
the
street
shining
through
a
window
;
and
the
figure
left
them
shut
in
an
airless
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
odd
,
Clennam
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
softly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Odd
enough
,
"
assented
Clennam
in
the
same
tone
,
"
but
we
have
succeeded
;
that
's
the
main
point
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
light
coming
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
light
was
a
lamp
,
and
the
bearer
was
an
old
woman
:
very
dirty
,
very
wrinkled
and
dry
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
at
home
,
"
she
said
(
and
the
voice
was
the
same
that
had
spoken
before
)
;
"
she
'll
come
directly
.
"
<EOS>
Having
set
the
lamp
down
on
the
table
,
the
old
woman
dusted
her
hands
on
her
apron
,
which
she
might
have
done
for
ever
without
cleaning
them
,
looked
at
the
visitors
with
a
dim
pair
of
eyes
,
and
backed
out
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
whom
they
had
come
to
see
,
if
she
were
the
present
occupant
of
the
house
,
appeared
to
have
taken
up
her
quarters
there
as
she
might
have
established
herself
in
an
Eastern
caravanserai
.
<EOS>
A
small
square
of
carpet
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
a
few
articles
of
furniture
that
evidently
did
not
belong
to
the
room
,
and
a
disorder
of
trunks
and
travelling
articles
,
formed
the
whole
of
her
surroundings
.
 
<EOS>
Under
some
former
regular
inhabitant
,
the
stifling
little
apartment
had
broken
out
into
a
pier
-
glass
and
a
gilt
table
;
but
the
gilding
was
as
faded
as
last
year
's
flowers
,
and
the
glass
was
so
clouded
that
it
seemed
to
hold
in
magic
preservation
all
the
fogs
and
bad
weather
<EOS>
it
had
ever
reflected
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitors
had
had
a
minute
or
two
to
look
about
them
,
when
the
door
opened
and
Miss
Wade
came
in
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
exactly
the
same
as
when
they
had
parted
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
handsome
,
just
as
scornful
,
just
as
repressed
.
 
<EOS>
She
manifested
no
surprise
in
seeing
them
,
nor
any
other
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
She
requested
them
to
be
seated
;
and
declining
to
take
a
seat
herself
,
at
once
anticipated
any
introduction
of
their
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
apprehend
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
I
know
the
cause
of
your
favouring
me
with
this
visit
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
come
to
it
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
cause
then
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
is
Tattycoram
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
supposed
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Miss
Wade
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
say
whether
you
know
anything
of
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
she
is
here
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
allow
me
to
make
known
to
you
that
I
shall
be
happy
to
have
her
back
,
and
that
my
wife
and
daughter
will
be
happy
to
have
her
back
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
with
us
a
long
time
:
we
do
n't
forget
her
claims
upon
us
,
and
I
hope
we
know
how
to
make
allowances
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
hope
to
know
how
to
make
allowances
?
<EOS>
"
she
returned
,
in
a
level
,
measured
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
what
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
my
friend
would
say
,
Miss
Wade
,
"
Arthur
Clennam
interposed
,
seeing
Mr
Meagles
rather
at
a
loss
,
"
for
the
passionate
sense
that
sometimes
comes
upon
the
poor
girl
,
of
being
at
a
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
Which
occasionally
gets
the
better
of
better
remembrances
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
broke
into
a
smile
as
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
?
"
was
all
she
answered
.
   
<EOS>
She
stood
by
the
table
so
perfectly
composed
and
still
after
this
acknowledgment
of
his
remark
that
Mr
Meagles
stared
at
her
under
a
sort
of
fascination
,
and
could
not
even
look
to
Clennam
to
make
another
move
.
 
<EOS>
After
waiting
,
awkwardly
enough
,
for
some
moments
,
Arthur
said
:
"
Perhaps
it
would
be
well
if
Mr
Meagles
could
see
her
,
Miss
Wade
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
easily
done
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
had
opened
a
door
while
saying
this
,
and
now
led
the
girl
in
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
curious
to
see
them
standing
together
<EOS>
:
the
girl
with
her
disengaged
fingers
plaiting
the
bosom
of
her
dress
,
half
irresolutely
,
half
passionately
;
Miss
Wade
with
her
composed
face
attentively
regarding
her
,
and
suggesting
to
an
observer
,
with
extraordinary
force
,
in
her
composure
itself
(
as
a
veil
will
suggest
the
form
it
covers
)
,
the
unquenchable
passion
of
her
own
nature
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
here
,
"
she
said
,
in
the
same
level
way
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
your
patron
,
your
master
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
willing
to
take
you
back
,
my
dear
,
if
you
are
sensible
of
the
favour
and
choose
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
be
,
again
,
a
foil
to
his
pretty
daughter
,
a
slave
to
her
pleasant
wilfulness
,
and
a
toy
in
the
house
showing
the
goodness
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
have
your
droll
name
again
,
playfully
pointing
you
out
and
setting
you
apart
,
as
it
is
right
that
you
should
be
pointed
out
and
set
apart
.
 
<EOS>
(
Your
birth
,
you
know
;
you
must
not
forget
your
birth
.
)
<EOS>
You
can
again
be
shown
to
this
gentleman
's
daughter
,
Harriet
,
and
kept
before
her
,
as
a
living
reminder
of
her
own
superiority
and
her
gracious
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
recover
all
these
advantages
and
many
more
of
the
same
kind
which
I
dare
say
start
up
in
your
memory
while
I
speak
,
and
which
you
lose
in
taking
refuge
with
me
---
you
can
recover
them
all
by
telling
these
gentlemen
how
humbled
and
penitent
you
are
,
and
by
going
back
to
them
to
be
forgiven
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
,
Harriet
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
go
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
who
,
under
the
influence
of
these
words
,
had
gradually
risen
in
anger
and
heightened
in
colour
,
answered
,
raising
her
lustrous
black
eyes
for
the
moment
,
and
clenching
her
hand
upon
the
folds
it
had
been
puckering
up
,
"
I
'd
die
sooner
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
,
still
standing
at
her
side
holding
her
hand
,
looked
quietly
round
and
said
with
a
smile
,
"
Gentlemen
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
do
upon
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Meagles
's
inexpressible
consternation
in
hearing
his
motives
and
actions
so
perverted
,
had
prevented
him
from
interposing
any
word
until
now
;
but
now
he
regained
the
power
of
speech
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tattycoram
,
"
said
he
,
"
for
I
'll
call
you
by
that
name
still
,
my
good
girl
,
conscious
that
I
meant
nothing
but
kindness
when
I
gave
it
to
you
,
and
conscious
that
you
know
it
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
looking
up
again
,
and
almost
rending
herself
with
the
same
busy
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
now
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
;
"
not
with
that
lady
's
eyes
<EOS>
so
intent
upon
you
,
Tattycoram
<EOS>
,
"
she
glanced
at
them
for
a
moment
,
"
and
that
power
over
you
,
which
we
see
she
exercises
;
not
now
,
perhaps
,
but
at
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
Tattycoram
,
I
'll
not
ask
that
lady
whether
she
believes
what
she
has
said
,
even
in
the
anger
and
ill
blood
in
which
I
and
my
friend
here
equally
know
she
has
spoken
,
though
she
subdues
herself
,
with
a
determination
that
any
one
who
has
once
seen
her
is
not
likely
to
forget
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
ask
you
,
with
your
remembrance
of
my
house
and
all
belonging
to
it
,
whether
you
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
only
say
that
you
have
no
profession
to
make
to
me
or
mine
,
and
no
forgiveness
to
entreat
;
and
that
all
in
the
world
that
I
ask
you
to
do
,
is
,
to
count
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
Tattycoram
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
,
and
then
said
frowningly
,
"
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
,
take
me
away
,
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
contention
that
raged
within
her
had
no
softening
in
it
now
;
it
was
wholly
between
passionate
defiance
and
stubborn
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
Her
rich
colour
,
her
quick
blood
,
her
rapid
breath
,
were
all
setting
themselves
against
the
opportunity
of
retracing
their
steps
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
in
a
low
,
thick
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
be
torn
to
pieces
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
tear
myself
to
pieces
first
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
,
who
had
released
her
hold
,
laid
her
hand
protectingly
on
the
girl
's
neck
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
looking
round
with
her
former
smile
and
speaking
exactly
in
her
former
tone
,
"
Gentlemen
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
do
upon
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tattycoram
,
Tattycoram
!
"
cried
Mr
Meagles
,
adjuring
her
besides
with
an
earnest
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
that
lady
's
voice
,
look
at
that
lady
's
face
,
consider
what
is
in
that
lady
's
heart
,
and
think
what
a
future
lies
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
child
,
whatever
you
may
think
,
that
lady
's
influence
over
you
---
astonishing
to
us
,
and
I
should
hardly
go
too
far
in
saying
terrible
to
us
to
see
---
is
founded
in
passion
fiercer
than
yours
,
and
temper
more
violent
than
yours
.
<EOS>
What
can
you
two
be
together
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
come
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
alone
here
,
gentlemen
,
"
observed
Miss
Wade
,
with
no
change
of
voice
or
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
anything
you
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Politeness
must
yield
to
this
misguided
girl
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
at
her
present
pass
;
though
I
hope
not
altogether
to
dismiss
it
,
even
with
the
injury
<EOS>
you
do
her
so
strongly
before
me
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
for
reminding
you
in
her
hearing
<EOS>
---
I
must
say
it
---
that
you
were
a
mystery
to
all
of
us
,
and
had
nothing
in
common
with
any
of
us
when
she
unfortunately
fell
in
your
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
are
,
but
you
do
n't
hide
,
ca
n't
hide
,
what
a
dark
spirit
you
have
within
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
should
happen
that
you
are
a
woman
,
who
,
from
whatever
cause
,
has
a
perverted
delight
in
making
a
sister
-
woman
as
wretched
as
she
is
(
I
am
old
enough
to
have
heard
of
such
)
,
I
warn
her
against
you
,
and
I
warn
you
against
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Wade
,
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
have
concluded
---
Mr
Clennam
,
perhaps
you
will
induce
your
friend
---
"
   
"
Not
without
another
effort
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
stoutly
.
<EOS>
"
Tattycoram
,
my
poor
dear
girl
,
count
five
-
and
-
twenty
.
"
<EOS>
"
Do
not
reject
the
hope
,
the
certainty
,
this
kind
man
offers
you
,
"
said
Clennam
in
a
low
emphatic
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Turn
to
the
friends
you
have
not
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
Think
once
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
,
"
said
the
girl
,
with
her
bosom
swelling
high
,
and
speaking
with
her
hand
held
to
her
throat
,
"
take
me
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tattycoram
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Once
more
yet
!
 
<EOS>
The
only
thing
I
ask
of
you
in
the
world
,
my
child
!
 
<EOS>
Count
five
-
and
-
twenty
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
put
her
hands
tightly
over
her
ears
,
confusedly
tumbling
down
her
bright
black
hair
in
the
vehemence
of
the
action
,
and
turned
her
face
resolutely
to
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
,
who
had
watched
her
under
this
final
appeal
with
that
strange
attentive
smile
,
and
that
repressing
hand
upon
her
own
bosom
with
which
she
had
watched
her
in
her
struggle
at
Marseilles
,
then
put
her
arm
about
her
waist
as
if
she
took
possession
of
her
for
evermore
.
   
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
visible
triumph
in
her
face
when
she
turned
it
to
dismiss
the
visitors
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
it
is
the
last
time
I
shall
have
the
honour
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
<EOS>
as
you
have
spoken
of
not
knowing
what
I
am
,
and
also
of
the
foundation
of
my
influence
here
,
you
may
now
know
that
it
is
founded
in
a
common
cause
.
 
<EOS>
What
your
broken
plaything
is
as
to
birth
,
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
no
name
,
I
have
no
name

<EOS>
Her
wrong
is
my
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
Mr
Meagles
,
who
sorrowfully
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
As
Clennam
followed
,
she
said
to
him
,
with
the
same
external
composure
and
in
the
same
level
voice
,
but
with
a
smile
that
is
only
seen
on
cruel
faces
:
a
very
faint
smile
,
lifting
the
nostril
,
scarcely
touching
the
lips
,
and
not
breaking
away
gradually
,
but
instantly
dismissed
when
done
with
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
the
wife
of
your
dear
friend
Mr
Gowan
,
may
be
happy
in
the
contrast
of
her
extraction
to
this
girl
's
and
mine
,
and
in
the
high
good
fortune
that
awaits
her

Nobody
's
Disappearance
 
Not
resting
satisfied
with
the
endeavours
he
had
made
to
recover
his
lost
charge
,
Mr
Meagles
addressed
a
letter
of
remonstrance
,
breathing
nothing
but
goodwill
,
not
only
to
her
,
but
to
Miss
Wade
too
.
 
<EOS>
No
answer
coming
to
these
epistles
,
or
to
another
written
to
the
stubborn
girl
by
the
hand
of
her
late
young
mistress
,
which
might
have
melted
her
if
anything
could
<EOS>
(
all
three
letters
were
returned
weeks
afterwards
as
having
been
refused
at
the
house
-
door
)
,
he
deputed
Mrs
Meagles
to
make
the
experiment
of
a
personal
interview
.
 
<EOS>
That
worthy
lady
being
unable
to
obtain
one
,
and
being
steadfastly
denied
admission
,
Mr
Meagles
besought
Arthur
to
essay
once
more
what
he
could
do
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
came
of
his
compliance
was
,
his
discovery
that
the
empty
house
was
left
in
charge
of
the
old
woman
,
that
Miss
Wade
was
gone
,
that
the
waifs
and
strays
of
furniture
were
gone
,
and
that
the
old
woman
would
accept
any
number
of
half
-
crowns
and
thank
the
donor
kindly
,
but
had
no
information
whatever
to
exchange
for
those
coins
,
beyond
constantly
offering
for
perusal
a
memorandum
relative
to
fixtures
,
which
the
house
-
agent
's
young
man
had
left
in
the
hall
.
   
<EOS>
Unwilling
,
even
under
this
discomfiture
,
to
resign
the
ingrate
and
leave
her
hopeless
,
in
case
of
her
better
dispositions
obtaining
the
mastery
over
the
darker
side
of
her
character
,
Mr
Meagles
,
for
six
successive
days
,
published
a
discreetly
covert
advertisement
in
the
morning
papers
,
to
the
effect
that
if
a
certain
young
person
who
had
lately
left
home
without
reflection
,
would
at
any
time
apply
to
his
address
at
Twickenham
,
everything
would
be
as
it
had
been
before
,
and
no
reproaches
need
be
apprehended
.
 
<EOS>
The
unexpected
consequences
of
this
notification
suggested
to
the
dismayed
Mr
Meagles
for
the
first
time
that
some
hundreds
of
young
persons
must
be
leaving
their
homes
without
reflection
every
day
;
for
shoals
of
wrong
young
people
came
down
to
Twickenham
,
who
,
not
finding
themselves
received
with
enthusiasm
,
generally
demanded
compensation
by
way
of
damages
,
in
addition
to
coach
-
hire
there
and
back
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
were
these
the
only
uninvited
clients
whom
the
advertisement
produced
.
 
<EOS>
The
swarm
of
begging
-
letter
writers
,
who
would
seem
to
be
always
watching
eagerly
for
any
hook
,
however
small
,
to
hang
a
letter
upon
,
wrote
to
say
that
having
seen
the
advertisement
,
they
were
induced
to
apply
with
confidence
for
various
sums
,
ranging
from
ten
shillings
to
fifty
pounds
:
not
because
they
knew
anything
about
the
young
person
,
but
because
they
felt
that
to
part
with
those
donations
would
greatly
relieve
the
advertiser
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Several
projectors
,
likewise
,
availed
themselves
of
the
same
opportunity
to
correspond
with
Mr
Meagles
;
as
,
for
example
,
to
apprise
him
that
their
attention
having
been
called
to
the
advertisement
by
a
friend
,
they
begged
to
state
that
if
they
should
ever
hear
anything
of
the
young
person
,
they
would
not
fail
to
make
it
known
to
him
immediately
,
and
that
in
the
meantime
if
he
would
oblige
them
with
the
funds
necessary
for
bringing
to
perfection
a
certain
entirely
novel
description
of
Pump
,
the
happiest
results
would
ensue
to
mankind
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
and
his
family
,
under
these
combined
discouragements
,
had
begun
reluctantly
to
give
up
Tattycoram
as
irrecoverable
,
when
the
new
and
active
firm
of
Doyce
and
Clennam
,
in
their
private
capacities
,
went
down
on
a
Saturday
to
stay
at
the
cottage
until
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
The
senior
partner
took
the
coach
,
and
the
junior
partner
took
his
walking
-
stick
.
   
<EOS>
A
tranquil
summer
sunset
shone
upon
him
as
he
approached
the
end
of
his
walk
,
and
passed
through
the
meadows
by
the
river
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
that
sense
of
peace
,
and
of
being
lightened
of
a
weight
of
care
,
which
country
quiet
awakens
in
the
breasts
of
dwellers
in
towns
.
<EOS>
Everything
within
his
view
was
lovely
and
placid
.
 
<EOS>
The
rich
foliage
of
the
trees
,
the
luxuriant
grass
diversified
with
wild
flowers
,
the
little
green
islands
in
the
river
,
the
beds
of
rushes
,
the
water
-
lilies
floating
on
the
surface
of
the
stream
,
the
distant
voices
in
boats
borne
musically
towards
him
on
the
ripple
of
the
water
and
the
evening
air
,
were
all
expressive
of
rest
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
occasional
leap
of
a
fish
,
or
dip
of
an
oar
,
or
twittering
of
a
bird
not
yet
at
roost
,
or
distant
barking
of
a
dog
,
or
lowing
of
a
cow
---
in
all
such
sounds
,
there
was
the
prevailing
breath
of
rest
,
which
seemed
to
encompass
him
in
every
scent
that
sweetened
the
fragrant
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
long
lines
of
red
and
gold
in
the
sky
,
and
the
glorious
track
of
the
descending
sun
,
were
all
divinely
calm
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
purple
tree
-
tops
far
away
,
and
on
the
green
height
near
at
hand
up
which
the
shades
were
slowly
creeping
,
there
was
an
equal
hush
.
<EOS>
Between
the
real
landscape
and
its
shadow
in
the
water
,
there
was
no
division
;
both
were
so
untroubled
and
clear
,
and
,
while
so
fraught
with
solemn
mystery
of
life
and
death
,
so
hopefully
reassuring
to
the
gazer
's
soothed
heart
,
because
so
tenderly
and
mercifully
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
had
stopped
,
not
for
the
first
time
by
many
times
,
to
look
about
him
and
suffer
what
he
saw
to
sink
into
his
soul
,
as
the
shadows
,
looked
at
,
seemed
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
slowly
resuming
his
way
,
when
he
saw
a
figure
in
the
path
before
him
which
he
had
,
perhaps
,
already
associated
with
the
evening
and
its
impressions
.
   
<EOS>
Minnie
was
there
,
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
some
roses
in
her
hand
,
and
seemed
to
have
stood
still
on
seeing
him
,
waiting
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
towards
him
,
and
she
appeared
to
have
been
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
flutter
in
her
manner
,
which
Clennam
had
never
seen
in
it
before
;
and
as
he
came
near
her
,
it
entered
his
mind
all
at
once
that
she
was
there
of
a
set
purpose
to
speak
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
said
,
"
You
wonder
to
see
me
here
by
myself
?
 
<EOS>
But
the
evening
is
so
lovely
<EOS>
,
I
have
strolled
further
than
I
meant
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
likely
I
might
meet
you
,
and
that
made
me
more
confident
.
 
<EOS>
You
always
come
this
way
,
do
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
Clennam
said
that
it
was
his
favourite
way
,
he
felt
her
hand
falter
on
his
arm
,
and
saw
the
roses
shake
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
let
me
give
you
one
,
Mr
Clennam
?
 
<EOS>
I
gathered
them
as
I
came
out
of
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
almost
gathered
them
for
you
,
thinking
it
so
likely
I
might
meet
you
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Doyce
arrived
more
than
an
hour
ago
,
and
told
us
you
were
walking
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
own
hand
shook
,
as
he
accepted
a
rose
or
two
from
hers
and
thanked
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
now
by
an
avenue
of
trees
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
they
turned
into
it
on
his
movement
or
on
hers
matters
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
knew
how
that
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
grave
here
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
but
very
pleasant
at
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
along
this
deep
shade
,
and
out
at
that
arch
of
light
at
the
other
end
,
we
come
upon
the
ferry
and
the
cottage
by
the
best
approach
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
In
her
simple
garden
-
hat
and
her
light
summer
dress
,
with
her
rich
brown
hair
naturally
clustering
about
her
,
and
her
wonderful
eyes
raised
to
his
for
a
moment
with
a
look
in
which
regard
for
him
and
trustfulness
in
him
were
strikingly
blended
with
a
kind
of
timid
sorrow
for
him
,
she
was
so
beautiful
that
it
was
well
for
his
peace
---
or
ill
for
his
peace
,
he
did
not
quite
know
which
---
that
he
had
made
that
vigorous
resolution
he
had
so
often
thought
about
.
   
<EOS>
She
broke
a
momentary
silence
by
inquiring
if
he
knew
that
papa
had
been
thinking
of
another
tour
abroad
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
heard
it
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
She
broke
another
momentary
silence
by
adding
,
with
some
hesitation
,
that
papa
had
abandoned
the
idea
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
,
he
thought
directly
,
"
they
are
to
be
married
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
"
she
said
,
hesitating
more
timidly
yet
,
and
speaking
so
low
that
he
bent
his
head
to
hear
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
very
much
like
to
give
you
my
confidence
,
if
you
would
not
mind
having
the
goodness
to
receive
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
very
much
liked
to
have
given
it
to
you
long
ago
,
because
---
I
felt
that
you
were
becoming
so
much
our
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
be
otherwise
than
proud
of
it
at
any
time
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
give
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
trust
me

<EOS>
"
I
could
never
have
been
afraid
of
trusting
you
,
"
she
returned
,
raising
her
eyes
frankly
to
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
would
have
done
so
some
time
ago
,
if
I
had
known
<EOS>
how
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
scarcely
know
how
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gowan
,
"
said
Arthur
Clennam
,
"
has
reason
to
be
very
happy
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
his
wife
and
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
wept
,
as
she
tried
to
thank
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
reassured
her
,
took
her
hand
as
it
lay
with
the
trembling
roses
in
it
on
his
arm
,
took
the
remaining
roses
from
it
,
and
put
it
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
time
,
it
seemed
to
him
,
he
first
finally
resigned
the
dying
hope
that
had
flickered
in
nobody
's
heart
so
much
to
its
pain
and
trouble
;
and
from
that
time
he
became
in
his
own
eyes
,
as
to
any
similar
hope
or
prospect
,
a
very
much
older
man
who
had
done
with
that
part
of
life
.
   
<EOS>
He
put
the
roses
in
his
breast
and
they
walked
on
for
a
little
while
,
slowly
and
silently
,
under
the
umbrageous
trees
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
asked
her
,
in
a
voice
of
cheerful
kindness
,
was
there
anything
else
that
she
would
say
to
him
as
her
friend
and
her
father
's
friend
,
many
years
older
than
herself
;
was
there
any
trust
she
would
repose
in
him
,
any
service
she
would
ask
of
him
,
any
little
aid
to
her
happiness
that
she
could
give
him
the
lasting
gratification
of
believing
it
was
in
his
power
to
render
?
   
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
answer
,
<EOS>
when
she
was
so
touched
by
some
little
hidden
sorrow
or
sympathy
---
what
could
it
have
been
?
---
that
she
said
,
bursting
into
tears
again
:
"
<EOS>
O
Mr
Clennam
!
 
<EOS>
Good
,
generous
,
Mr
Clennam
,
pray
tell
me
you
do
not
blame
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
blame
you
?
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
girl
!
 
<EOS>
I
blame
you
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
clasping
both
her
hands
upon
his
arm
,
and
looking
confidentially
up
into
his
face
,
with
some
hurried
words
to
the
effect
that
she
thanked
him
from
her
heart
(
as
she
did
,
if
it
be
the
source
of
earnestness
)
,
she
gradually
composed
herself
,
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
word
of
encouragement
from
him
,
as
they
walked
on
slowly
and
almost
silently
under
the
darkening
trees
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
now
,
Minnie
Gowan
<EOS>
,
"
at
length
said
Clennam
,
smiling
;
"
will
you
ask
me
nothing
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
very
much
to
ask
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
;
I
am
not
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
I
am
loved
at
home
,
and
how
I
love
home
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
think
it
perhaps
,
dear
Mr
Clennam
,
"
she
spoke
with
great
agitation
,
"
seeing
me
going
from
it
of
my
own
free
will
and
choice
,
but
I
do
so
dearly
love
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
that
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
suppose
I
doubt
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
strange
,
even
to
me
,
that
loving
it
so
much
and
being
so
much
beloved
in
it
,
I
can
bear
to
cast
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
so
neglectful
of
it
,
so
unthankful
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
it
is
in
the
natural
progress
and
change
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
All
homes
are
left
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
know
;
but
all
homes
are
not
left
with
such
a
blank
in
them
as
there
will
be
in
mine
when
I
am
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
there
is
any
scarcity
of
far
better
and
more
endearing
and
more
accomplished
girls
than
I
am
;
not
that
I
am
much
,
but
that
they
have
made
so
much
of
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Pet
's
affectionate
heart
was
overcharged
,
and
she
sobbed
while
she
pictured
what
would
happen
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
a
change
papa
will
feel
at
first
,
and
I
know
that
at
first
I
can
not
be
to
him
anything
like
what
I
have
been
these
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
then
,
Mr
Clennam
,
then
more
than
at
any
time
,
that
I
beg
and
entreat
you
to
remember
him
,
and
sometimes
to
keep
him
company
when
you
can
spare
a
little
while
;
and
to
tell
him
that
you
know
I
was
fonder
of
him
when
I
left
him
,
than
I
ever
was
in
all
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
For
there
is
nobody
<EOS>
---
he
told
me
so
himself
when
he
talked
to
me
this
very
day
---
there
is
nobody
he
likes
so
well
as
you
,
or
trusts
so
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
clue
to
what
had
passed
between
the
father
and
daughter
dropped
like
a
heavy
stone
into
the
well
of
Clennam
's
heart
,
and
swelled
the
water
to
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
cheerily
,
but
not
quite
so
cheerily
as
he
tried
to
say
,
that
it
should
be
done
---
that
he
gave
her
his
faithful
promise
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
not
speak
of
mama
,
"
said
Pet
,
more
moved
by
,
and
more
pretty
in
,
her
innocent
grief
,
than
Clennam
could
trust
himself
even
to
consider
---
for
which
reason
he
counted
the
trees
between
them
and
the
fading
light
as
they
slowly
diminished
in
number
---
"
it
is
because
mama
will
understand
me
better
in
this
action
,
and
will
feel
my
loss
in
a
different
way
,
and
will
look
forward
in
a
different
manner
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
<EOS>
what
a
dear
,
devoted
mother
she
is
,
and
you
will
remember
her
too
;
will
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
Let
Minnie
trust
him
<EOS>
,
Clennam
said
,
let
Minnie
trust
him
to
do
all
she
wished
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
dear
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
Minnie
,
"
because
papa
and
one
whom
I
need
not
name
,
do
not
fully
appreciate
and
understand
one
another
yet
,
as
they
will
by
-
and
-
by
;
and
because
it
will
be
the
duty
,
and
the
pride
,
and
pleasure
of
my
new
life
,
to
draw
them
to
a
better
knowledge
of
one
another
,
and
to
be
a
happiness
to
one
another
,
and
to
be
proud
of
one
another

and
to
love
one
another
,
both
loving
me
so
dearly
;
<EOS>
oh
,
as
you
are
a
kind
,
true
man
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
am
first
separated
from
home
(
I
am
going
a
long
distance
away
)
,
try
to
reconcile
papa
to
him
a
little
more
,
and
use
your
great
influence
to
keep
him
before
papa
's
mind
free
from
prejudice
and
in
his
real
form
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
do
this
for
me
,
as
you
are
a
noble
-
hearted
friend
?
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Pet
!
 
<EOS>
Self
-
deceived
,
mistaken
child
!
 
<EOS>
When
were
such
changes
ever
made
in
men
's
natural
relations
to
one
another
:
when
was
such
reconcilement
of
ingrain
differences
ever
effected
!
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
tried
many
times
by
other
daughters
,
Minnie
;
it
has
never
succeeded
;
nothing
has
ever
come
of
it
but
failure
.
   
<EOS>
So
Clennam
thought
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
did
not
say
;
it
was
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
He
bound
himself
to
do
all
she
asked
,
and
she
knew
full
well
that
he
would
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
now
at
the
last
tree
in
the
avenue
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
and
withdrew
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Speaking
to
him
with
her
eyes
lifted
up
to
his
,
and
with
the
hand
that
had
lately
rested
on
his
sleeve
trembling
by
touching
one
of
the
roses
in
his
breast
as
an
additional
appeal
to
him
<EOS>
,
she
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mr
Clennam
,
in
my
happiness
---
for
I
am
happy
,
though
you
have
seen
me
crying
<EOS>
---
I
can
not
bear
to
leave
any
cloud
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
anything
to
forgive
me
(
not
anything
that
I
have
wilfully
done
,
but
any
trouble
I
may
have
caused
you
without
meaning
it
,
or
having
it
in
my
power
to
help
it
)
,
forgive
me
to
-
night
out
of
your
noble
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stooped
to
meet
the
guileless
face
that
met
his
without
shrinking
.
 
<EOS>
He
kissed
it
,
and
answered
,
Heaven
knew
that
he
had
nothing
to
forgive
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
stooped
to
meet
the
innocent
face
once
again
,
she
whispered
,
"
Good
-
bye
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
repeated
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
taking
leave
of
all
his
old
hopes
---
all
nobody
's
old
restless
doubts
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
out
of
the
avenue
next
moment
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
as
they
had
entered
it
:
and
the
trees
seemed
to
close
up
behind
them
in
the
darkness
,
like
their
own
perspective
of
the
past
.
   
<EOS>
The
voices
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
and
Doyce
were
audible
directly
,
speaking
near
the
garden
gate
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
Pet
's
name
among
them
,
Clennam
called
out
<EOS>
,
"
She
is
here
,
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
some
little
wondering
and
laughing
until
they
came
up
;
but
as
soon
as
they
had
all
come
together
,
it
ceased
,
and
Pet
glided
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
Doyce
,
and
Clennam
,
without
speaking
,
walked
up
and
down
on
the
brink
of
the
river
,
in
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
,
for
a
few
minutes
;
and
then
Doyce
lingered
behind
,
and
went
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
and
Clennam
walked
up
and
down
together
for
a
few
minutes
more
without
speaking
,
until
at
length
the
former
broke
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Arthur
,
"
said
he
,
using
that
familiar
address
for
the
first
time
in
their
communication
,
"
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
,
as
we
walked
up
and
down
one
hot
morning
,
looking
over
the
harbour
at
Marseilles
,
that
Pet
's
baby
sister
who
was
dead
seemed
to
Mother
and
me
to
have
grown
as
she
had
grown
,
and
changed
as
she
had
changed
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
You
remember
my
saying
that
our
thoughts
had
never
been
able
to
separate
those
twin
sisters
,
and
that
,
in
our
fancy
,
whatever
Pet
was
,
the
other
was
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Arthur
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
much
subdued
,
"
<EOS>
I
carry
that
fancy
further
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
to
-
night
,
<EOS>
my
dear
fellow
,
as
if
you
had
loved
my
dead
child
very
tenderly
,
and
had
lost
her
when
she
was
like
what
Pet
is
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Clennam
,
"
thank
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
pressed
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
in
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
presently
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
little
while
.
"
   
Mr
Meagles
fell
away
,
and
he
was
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
walked
on
the
river
's
brink
in
the
peaceful
moonlight
for
some
half
an
hour
,
he
put
his
hand
in
his
breast
and
tenderly
took
out
the
handful
of
roses
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
put
them
to
his
heart
,
perhaps
he
put
them
to
his
lips
,
but
certainly
he
bent
down
on
the
shore
and
gently
launched
them
on
the
flowing
river
.
 
<EOS>
Pale
and
unreal
in
the
moonlight
,
the
river
floated
them
away
.
<EOS>
The
lights
were
bright
within
doors
when
he
entered
,
and
the
faces
on
which
they
shone
,
his
own
face
not
excepted
,
were
soon
quietly
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
They
talked
of
many
subjects
(
his
partner
never
had
had
such
a
ready
store
to
draw
upon
for
the
beguiling
of
the
time
)
,
and
so
to
bed
,
and
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
flowers
,
pale
and
unreal
in
the
moonlight
,
floated
away
upon
the
river
;
and
thus
do
greater
things
that
once
were
in
our
breasts
,
and
near
our
hearts
,
flow
from
us
to
the
eternal
seas

on
Dreaming
 
<EOS>
The
house
in
the
city
preserved
its
heavy
dulness
through
all
these
transactions
,
and
the
invalid
within
it
turned
the
same
unvarying
round
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
each
recurring
with
its
accompanying
monotony
,
always
the
same
reluctant
return
of
the
same
sequences
of
machinery
,
like
a
dragging
piece
of
clockwork
.
   
<EOS>
The
wheeled
chair
had
its
associated
remembrances
and
reveries
,
one
may
suppose
,
as
every
place
that
is
made
the
station
of
a
human
being
has
.
 
<EOS>
Pictures
of
demolished
streets
and
altered
houses
,
as
they
formerly
were
when
the
occupant
of
the
chair
was
familiar
with
them
,
images
of
people
as
they
too
used
to
be
,
with
little
or
no
allowance
made
for
the
lapse
of
time
since
they
were
seen
;
of
these
,
there
must
have
been
many
in
the
long
routine
of
gloomy
days
.
 
<EOS>
To
stop
the
clock
of
busy
existence
at
the
hour
when
we
were
personally
sequestered
from
it
,
to
suppose
mankind
stricken
motionless
when
we
were
brought
to
a
stand
-
still
,
to
be
unable
to
measure
the
changes
beyond
our
view
by
any
larger
standard
than
the
shrunken
one
of
our
own
uniform
and
contracted
existence
,
is
the
infirmity
of
many
invalids
,
and
the
mental
unhealthiness
of
almost
all
recluses

scenes

the

her
daily
like
some
eccentric
mechanical
force
,
would
perhaps
have
screwed
it
out
of
her
,
if
there
had
been
less
resistance
in
her
;
but
she
was
too
strong
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
as
Mistress
Affery
was
concerned
,
to
regard
her
liege
-
lord
and
her
disabled
mistress
with
a
face
of
blank
wonder
,
to
go
about
the
house
after
dark
with
her
apron
over
her
head
,
always
to
listen
for
the
strange
noises
and
sometimes
to
hear
them
,
and
never
to
emerge
from
her
ghostly
,
dreamy
,
sleep
-
waking
state
,
was
occupation
enough
for
her
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
fair
stroke
of
business
doing
,
as
Mistress
Affery
made
out
,
for
her
husband
had
abundant
occupation
in
his
little
office
,
and
saw
more
people
than
had
been
used
to
come
there
for
some
years
.
 
<EOS>
This
might
easily
be
,
the
house
having
been
long
deserted
;
but
he
did
receive
letters
,
and
comers
,
and
keep
books
,
and
correspond
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
went
about
to
other
counting
-
houses
,
and
to
wharves
,
and
docks
,
and
to
the
Custom
House
,
"
and
to
Garraway
's
Coffee
House
,
and
the
Jerusalem
Coffee
House
,
and
on
"
Change
;
so
that
he
was
much
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
,
too
,
sometimes
of
an
evening
,
when
Mrs
Clennam
expressed
no
particular
wish
for
his
society
,
to
resort
to
a
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
to
look
at
the
shipping
news
and
closing
prices
in
the
evening
paper
,
and
even
to
exchange
Small
socialities
with
mercantile
Sea
Captains
who
frequented
that
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
At
some
period
of
every
day
,
he
and
Mrs
Clennam
held
a
council
on
matters
of
business
;
and
it
appeared
to
Affery
,
who
was
always
groping
about
,
listening
and
watching
,
that
the
two
clever
ones
were
making
money
.
   
<EOS>
The
state
of
mind
into
which
Mr
Flintwinch
's
dazed
lady
had
fallen
,
had
now
begun
to
be
so
expressed
in
all
her
looks
and
actions
that
she
was
held
in
very
low
account
by
the
two
clever
ones
,
as
a
person
,
never
of
strong
intellect
,
who
was
becoming
foolish
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
because
her
appearance
was
not
of
a
commercial
cast
,
or
perhaps
because
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
having
taken
her
to
wife
might
expose
his
judgment
to
doubt
in
the
minds
of
customers
,
Mr
Flintwinch
laid
his
commands
upon
her
that
she
should
hold
her
peace
on
the
subject
of
her
conjugal
relations
,
and
should
no
longer
call
him
Jeremiah
out
of
the
domestic
trio
.
 
<EOS>
Her
frequent
forgetfulness
of
this
admonition
intensified
her
startled
manner
,
since
Mr
Flintwinch
's
habit
of
avenging
himself
on
her
remissness
by
making
springs
after
her
on
the
staircase
,
and
shaking
her
,
occasioned
her
to
be
always
nervously
uncertain
when
she
might
be
thus
waylaid
next
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
had
finished
a
long
day
's
work
in
Mrs
Clennam
's
room
,
and
was
neatly
gathering
up
her
shreds
and
odds
and
ends
before
going
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
whom
Affery
had
just
shown
in
,
was
addressing
an
inquiry
to
Mrs
Clennam
on
the
subject
of
her
health
,
coupled
with
the
remark
that
,
"
happening
to
find
himself
in
that
direction
,
"
he
had
looked
in
to
inquire
,
on
behalf
of
his
proprietor
,
how
she
found
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
,
with
a
deep
contraction
of
her
brows
,
was
looking
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Casby
knows
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
I
am
not
subject
to
changes
.
 
<EOS>
The
change
that
I
await
here
is
the
great
change
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
ma'am
?
"
returned
Mr
Pancks
,
with
a
wandering
eye
towards
the
figure
of
the
little
seamstress
on
her
knee
picking
threads
and
fraying
of
her
work
from
the
carpet
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
look
nicely
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
bear
what
I
have
to
bear
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
what
you
have
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
"
<EOS>
such
is
my
endeavour
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
often
in
this
direction
,
are
you
not
?
"
asked
Mrs
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
<EOS>
rather
so
lately
;
I
have
lately
been
round
this
way
a
good
deal
,
owing
to
one
thing
and
another
.
"
<EOS>
"
Beg
Mr
Casby
and
his
daughter
not
to
trouble
themselves
,
by
deputy
,
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
wish
to
see
me
,
they
know
I
am
here
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
need
to
trouble
themselves
to
send
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
need
to
trouble
yourself
to
come
.
"
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
trouble
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
really
are
looking
uncommonly
nicely
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Good
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
dismissal
,
and
its
accompanying
finger
pointed
straight
at
the
door
,
was
so
curt
and
direct
that
Mr
Pancks
did
not
see
his
way
to
prolong
his
visit
.
 
<EOS>
He
stirred
up
his
hair
with
his
sprightliest
expression
,
glanced
at
the
little
figure
again
,
said
"
Good
evening
,
ma
"
am
;
do
n't
come
down
,
Mrs
Affery
<EOS>
,
I
know
the
road
to
the
door
,
"
and
steamed
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
,
her
chin
resting
on
her
hand
,
followed
him
with
attentive
and
darkly
distrustful
eyes
;
and
Affery
stood
looking
at
her
as
if
she
were
spell
-
bound
.
   
<EOS>
Slowly
and
thoughtfully
,
Mrs
Clennam
's
eyes
turned
from
the
door
by
which
Pancks
had
gone
out
,
to
Little
Dorrit
,
rising
from
the
carpet
.
 
<EOS>
With
her
chin
drooping
more
heavily
on
her
hand
,
and
her
eyes
vigilant
and
lowering
,
the
sick
woman
sat
looking
at
her
until
she
attracted
her
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
coloured
under
such
a
gaze
,
and
looked
down
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
still
sat
intent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Little
Dorrit
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
at
last
broke
silence
,
"
what
do
you
know
of
that
man
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
of
him
,
ma'am
,
except
that
I
have
seen
him
about
,
and
that
he
has
spoken
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
has
he
said
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
what
he
has
said
,
he
is
so
strange
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
rough
or
disagreeable
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
does
he
come
here
to
see
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
with
perfect
frankness
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
he
does
come
here
to
see
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
fancied
so
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
he
should
come
here
or
anywhere
for
that
,
ma'am
,
I
ca
n't
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
cast
her
eyes
towards
the
ground
,
and
with
her
strong
,
set
face
,
as
intent
upon
a
subject
in
her
mind
as
it
had
lately
been
upon
the
form
that
seemed
to
pass
out
of
her
view
,
sat
absorbed
.
 
<EOS>
Some
minutes
elapsed
before
she
came
out
of
this
thoughtfulness
,
and
resumed
her
hard
composure
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
in
the
meanwhile
had
been
waiting
to
go
,
but
afraid
to
disturb
her
by
moving
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
ventured
to
leave
the
spot
where
she
had
been
standing
since
she
had
risen
,
and
to
pass
gently
round
by
the
wheeled
chair
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
at
its
side
to
say
"
Good
night
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
put
out
her
hand
,
and
laid
it
on
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
confused
under
the
touch
,
stood
faltering
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
some
momentary
recollection
of
the
story
of
the
Princess
may
have
been
in
her
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Little
Dorrit
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
"
have
you
many
friends
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
few
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
you
,
only
Miss
Flora
and
---
one
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Meaning
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
with
her
unbent
finger
again
pointing
to
the
door
,
"
that
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
ma'am
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Some
friend
of
his
,
perhaps
?
"
   
"
No
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
earnestly
shook
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
!
 
<EOS>
No
one
at
all
like
him
,
or
belonging
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
almost
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
affair
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
,
because
I
take
an
interest
in
you
;
and
because
I
believe
I
was
your
friend
when
you
had
no
other
who
could
serve
you
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
;
indeed
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
here
many
a
time
when
,
but
for
you
and
the
work
you
gave
me
,
we
should
have
wanted
everything
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Clennam
,
looking
towards
the
watch
,
once
her
dead
husband
's
,
which
always
lay
upon
her
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
there
many
of
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
father
and
I
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
only
father
and
I
to
keep
regularly
out
of
what
we
get
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
undergone
many
privations
?
 
<EOS>
You
and
your
father
and
who
else
there
may
be
of
you
?
"
asked
Mrs
Clennam
,
speaking
deliberately
,
and
meditatively
turning
the
watch
over
and
over
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
it
has
been
rather
hard
to
live
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
in
her
soft
voice
,
and
timid
uncomplaining
way
;
"
but
I
think
not
harder
---
as
to
that
---
than
many
people
find
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
said
!
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Clennam
quickly
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
truth
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
good
,
thoughtful
girl
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
grateful
girl
too
,
or
I
much
mistake
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
natural
to
be
that
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
merit
in
being
that
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
indeed
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
,
with
a
gentleness
of
which
the
dreaming
Affery
had
never
dreamed
her
to
be
capable
,
drew
down
the
face
of
her
little
seamstress
,
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
go
,
Little
Dorrit
,
"
said
she
,
"
or
you
will
be
late
,
poor
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
all
the
dreams
Mistress
Affery
had
been
piling
up
since
she
first
became
devoted
to
the
pursuit
,
she
had
dreamed
nothing
more
astonishing
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
Her
head
ached
with
the
idea
that
she
would
find
the
other
clever
one
kissing
Little
Dorrit
next
,
and
then
the
two
clever
ones
embracing
each
other
and
dissolving
into
tears
of
tenderness
for
all
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
quite
stunned
her
,
as
she
attended
the
light
footsteps
down
the
stairs
,
that
the
house
door
might
be
safely
shut
.
   
<EOS>
On
opening
it
to
let
Little
Dorrit
out
,
she
found
Mr
Pancks
,
instead
of
having
gone
his
way
,
as
in
any
less
wonderful
place
and
among
less
wonderful
phenomena
he
might
have
been
reasonably
expected
to
do
,
fluttering
up
and
down
the
court
outside
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
The
moment
he
saw
Little
Dorrit
,
he
passed
her
briskly
,
said
with
his
finger
to
his
nose
(
as
Mrs
Affery
distinctly
heard
)
,
"
Pancks
the
gipsy
,
fortune
-
telling
,
"
and
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
save
us
<EOS>
,
here
's
a
gipsy
and
a
fortune
-
teller
in
it
now
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mistress
Affery
.
<EOS>
"
What
next
!
 
<EOS>
She
stood
at
the
open
door
,
staggering
herself
with
this
enigma
,
on
a
rainy
,
thundery
evening
.
 
<EOS>
The
clouds
were
flying
fast
,
and
the
wind
was
coming
up
in
gusts
,
banging
some
neighbouring
shutters
that
had
broken
loose
,
twirling
the
rusty
chimney
-
cowls
and
weather
-
cocks
,
and
rushing
round
and
round
a
confined
adjacent
churchyard
as
if
it
had
a
mind
to
blow
the
dead
citizens
out
of
their
graves
.
 
<EOS>
The
low
thunder
,
muttering
in
all
quarters
of
the
sky
at
once
,
seemed
to
threaten
vengeance
for
this
attempted
desecration
,
and
to
mutter
,
"
Let
them
rest
!
 
<EOS>
Let
them
rest
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
,
whose
fear
of
thunder
and
lightning
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
her
dread
of
the
haunted
house
with
a
premature
and
preternatural
darkness
in
it
,
stood
undecided
whether
to
go
in
or
not
,
until
the
question
was
settled
for
her
by
the
door
blowing
upon
her
in
a
violent
gust
of
wind
and
shutting
her
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
be
done
now
,
what
's
to
be
done
now
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mistress
Affery
,
wringing
her
hands
in
this
last
uneasy
dream
of
all
;
"
when
she
's
all
alone
by
herself
inside
,
and
can
no
more
come
down
to
open
it
than
the
churchyard
dead
themselves
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
,
Mistress
Affery
,
with
her
apron
as
a
hood
to
keep
the
rain
off
,
ran
crying
up
and
down
the
solitary
paved
enclosure
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
Why
she
should
then
stoop
down
and
look
in
at
the
keyhole
of
the
door
as
if
an
eye
would
open
it
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
;
but
it
is
none
the
less
what
most
people
would
have
done
in
the
same
situation
,
and
it
is
what
she
did
.
   
<EOS>
From
this
posture
she
started
up
suddenly
,
with
a
half
scream
,
feeling
something
on
her
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
touch
of
a
hand
;
of
a
man
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
was
dressed
like
a
traveller
,
in
a
foraging
cap
with
fur
about
it
,
and
a
heap
of
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
like
a
foreigner
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
quantity
of
hair
and
moustache
---
<EOS>
jet
black
,
except
at
the
shaggy
ends
,
where
it
had
a
tinge
of
red
---
and
a
high
hook
nose
.
 
<EOS>
He
laughed
at
Mistress
Affery
's
start
and
cry
;
and
as
he
laughed
,
his
moustache
went
up
under
his
nose
,
and
his
nose
came
down
over
his
moustache
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
in
plain
English
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
frightened
at
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
you
,
"
panted
Affery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
,
madam
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
dismal
evening
,
and
<EOS>
---
and
everything
,
"
said
Affery
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
here
!
 
<EOS>
The
wind
has
been
and
blown
the
door
to
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
said
the
gentleman
,
who
took
that
very
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
such
a
name
as
Clennam
about
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
us
,
I
should
think
I
did
,
I
should
think
I
did
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Affery
,
exasperated
into
a
new
wringing
of
hands
by
the
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
about
here
?
"
   
"
Where
!
"
cried
Affery
,
goaded
into
another
inspection
of
the
keyhole
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
but
here
in
this
house
?
 
<EOS>
And
she
's
all
alone
in
her
room
,
and
lost
the
use
of
her
limbs
and
ca
n't
stir
to
help
herself
or
me
,
and
t'other
clever
one
's
out
,
and
Lord
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Affery
,
driven
into
a
frantic
dance
by
these
accumulated
considerations
,
"
if
I
ai
n't
a
-
going
headlong
out
of
my
mind
!
"
   
<EOS>
Taking
a
warmer
view
of
the
matter
now
that
it
concerned
himself
,
the
gentleman
stepped
back
to
glance
at
the
house
,
and
his
eye
soon
rested
on
the
long
narrow
window
of
the
little
room
near
the
hall
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
may
the
lady
be
who
has
lost
the
use
of
her
limbs
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
,
with
that
peculiar
smile
which
Mistress
Affery
could
not
choose
but
keep
her
eyes
upon
.
   
<EOS>
"
Up
there
!
"
said
Affery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Them
two
windows
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hah
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
of
a
fair
size
,
but
could
not
have
the
honour
of
presenting
myself
in
that
room
without
a
ladder
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
madam
,
frankly
 
---
frankness
is
a
part
of
my
character
---
shall
I
open
the
door
for
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
bless
you
,
sir
,
for
a
dear
creetur
,
and
do
it
at
once
,
"
cried
Affery
,
"
for
she
may
be
a
-
calling
to
me
at
this
very
present
minute
,
or
may
be
setting
herself
a
fire
and
burning
herself
to
death
,
or
there
's
no
knowing
what
may
be
happening
to
her
,
and
me
a

going
out
of
my
mind
at
thinking
of
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
my
good
madam
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
restrained
her
impatience
with
a
smooth
white
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Business
-
hours
,
I
apprehend
,
are
over
for
the
day
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
"
cried
Affery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
make
,
then
,
a
fair
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
Fairness
is
a
part
of
my
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
just
landed
from
the
packet
-
boat
,
as
you
may
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
showed
her
that
his
cloak
was
very
wet
,
and
that
his
boots
were
saturated
with
water
;
she
had
previously
observed
that
he
was
dishevelled
and
sallow
,
as
if
from
a
rough
voyage
,
and
so
chilled
that
he
could
not
keep
his
teeth
from
chattering
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
just
landed
from
the
packet
-
boat
,
madam
,
and
have
been
delayed
by
the
weather
:
the
infernal
weather
!
 
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
,
madam
,
some
necessary
business
that
I
should
otherwise
have
transacted
here
within
the
regular
hours
(
necessary
business
because
money
-
business
)
,
still
remains
to
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
you
will
fetch
any
authorised
neighbouring
somebody
to
do
it
in
return
for
my
opening
the
door
,
I
'll
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
arrangement
should
be
objectionable
,
I
'll
---
"
and
with
the
same
smile
he
made
a
significant
feint
of
backing
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
,
heartily
glad
to
effect
the
proposed
compromise
,
gave
in
her
willing
adhesion
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
at
once
requested
her
to
do
him
the
favour
of
holding
his
cloak
,
took
a
short
run
at
the
narrow
window
,
made
a
leap
at
the
sill
,
clung
his
way
up
the
bricks
,
and
in
a
moment
had
his
hand
at
the
sash
,
raising
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
looked
so
very
sinister
,
as
he
put
his
leg
into
the
room
and
glanced
round
at
Mistress
Affery
,
that
she
thought
with
a
sudden
coldness
,
if
he
were
to
go
straight
up
-
stairs
to
murder
the
invalid
,
what
could
she
do
to
prevent
him
?
   
<EOS>
Happily
he
had
no
such
purpose
;
for
he
reappeared
,
in
a
moment
,
at
the
house
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
took
back
his
cloak
and
threw
it
on
,
"
if
you
have
the
goodness
to
---
what
the
Devil
's
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
strangest
of
sounds
.
 
<EOS>
Evidently
close
at
hand
from
the
peculiar
shock
it
communicated
to
the
air
,
yet
subdued
as
if
it
were
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
A
tremble
,
a
rumble
,
and
a
fall
of
some
light
dry
matter
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
Devil
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
,
but
I
've
heard
the
like
of
it
over
and
over
again
,
"
said
Affery
,
who
had
caught
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
be
a
very
brave
man
,
even
she
thought
in
her
dreamy
start
and
fright
,
for
his
trembling
lips
had
turned
colourless
.
<EOS>
After
listening
a
few
moments
,
he
made
light
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
 
<EOS>
Nothing
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
madam
,
I
think
you
spoke
of
some
clever
personage
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
be
so
good
as
to
confront
me
with
that
genius
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
held
the
door
in
his
hand
,
as
though
he
were
quite
ready
to
shut
her
out
again
if
she
failed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
say
anything
about
the
door
and
me
,
then
,
"
whispered
Affery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
do
n't
you
stir
from
here
,
or
speak
if
she
calls
,
while
I
run
round
the
corner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
I
am
a
statue
.
"
   
<EOS>
Affery
had
so
vivid
a
fear
of
his
going
stealthily
<EOS>
up
-
stairs
<EOS>
the
moment
her
back
was
turned
,
<EOS>
that
after
hurrying
out
of
sight
,
she
returned
to
the
gateway
to
peep
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
him
still
on
the
threshold
,
more
out
of
the
house
than
in
it
,
as
if
he
had
no
love
for
darkness
and
no
desire
to
probe
its
mysteries
,
she
flew
into
the
next
street
,
and
sent
a
message
into
the
tavern
to
Mr
Flintwinch
,
who
came
out
directly
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
returning
together
---
the
lady
in
advance
,
and
Mr
Flintwinch
coming
up
briskly
behind
,
animated
with
the
hope
of
shaking
her
before
she
could
get
housed
<EOS>
---
saw
the
gentleman
standing
in
the
same
place
in
the
dark
,
and
heard
the
strong
voice
of
Mrs
Clennam
calling
from
her
room
,
"
Who
is
it
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Why
does
no
one
answer
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
that
,
down
there
?

The
Word
of
a
Gentleman
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
and
Mrs
Flintwinch
panted
up
to
the
door
of
the
old
house
in
the
twilight
,
Jeremiah
within
a
second
of
Affery
,
the
stranger
started
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Death
of
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
did
you
get
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
to
whom
these
words
were
spoken
,
repaid
the
stranger
's
wonder
in
full
.
 
<EOS>
He
gazed
at
him
with
blank
astonishment
;
he
looked
over
his
own
shoulder
,
as
expecting
to
see
some
one
he
had
not
been
aware
of
standing
behind
him
;
he
gazed
at
the
stranger
again
,
speechlessly
,
at
a
loss
to
know
what
he
meant
;
he
looked
to
his
wife
for
explanation
;
receiving
none
,
he
pounced
upon
her
,
and
shook
her
with
such
heartiness
that
he
shook
her
cap
off
her
head
,
saying
between
his
teeth
,
with
grim
raillery
,
as
he
did
it
,
"
Affery
,
my
woman
,
you
must
have
a
dose
,
my
woman
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
some
of
your
tricks
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
dreaming
again
,
mistress
.
<EOS>
What
's
it
about
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
What
does
it
mean
!
 
<EOS>
Speak
out
or
be
choked
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
only
choice
I
'll
give
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Supposing
Mistress
Affery
to
have
any
power
of
election
at
the
moment
,
her
choice
was
decidedly
to
be
choked
;
for
she
answered
not
a
syllable
to
this
adjuration
,
but
,
with
her
bare
head
wagging
violently
backwards
and
forwards
,
resigned
herself
to
her
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
however
,
picking
up
her
cap
with
an
air
of
gallantry
,
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
,
"
said
he
,
laying
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
Jeremiah
,
who
stopped
and
released
his
victim
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
.
<EOS>
Husband
and
wife
<EOS>
I
know
,
from
this
playfulness
.
 
<EOS>
Haha
!
 
<EOS>
Always
agreeable
to
see
that
relation
playfully
maintained
.
 
<EOS>
Listen
!
 
<EOS>
May
I
suggest
that
somebody
up
-
stairs
,
in
the
dark
,
is
becoming
energetically
curious
to
know
what
is
going
on
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
reference
to
Mrs
Clennam
's
voice
reminded
Mr
Flintwinch
to
step
into
the
hall
and
call
up
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
,
I
am
here
,
Affery
is
coming
with
your
light
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
said
to
the
latter
flustered
woman
,
who
was
putting
her
cap
on
,
"
Get
out
with
you
,
and
get
up
-
stairs
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
turned
to
the
stranger
and
said
to
him
,
"
Now
,
sir
,
what
might
you
please
to
want
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
"
I
must
be
so
troublesome
as
to
propose
a
candle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
assented
Jeremiah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Please
to
stand
where
you
are
while
I
get
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
visitor
was
standing
in
the
doorway
,
but
turned
a
little
into
the
gloom
of
the
house
as
Mr
Flintwinch
turned
,
and
pursued
him
with
his
eyes
into
the
little
room
,
where
he
groped
about
for
a
phosphorus
box
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
found
it
,
it
was
damp
,
or
otherwise
out
of
order
;
and
match
after
match
that
he
struck
into
it
lighted
sufficiently
to
throw
a
dull
glare
about
his
groping
face
,
and
to
sprinkle
his
hands
with
pale
little
spots
of
fire
,
but
not
sufficiently
to
light
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
taking
advantage
of
this
fitful
illumination
of
his
visage
,
looked
intently
and
wonderingly
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jeremiah
,
when
he
at
last
lighted
the
candle
,
knew
he
had
been
doing
this
,
by
seeing
the
last
shade
of
a
lowering
watchfulness
clear
away
from
his
face
,
as
it
broke
into
the
doubtful
smile
that
was
a
large
ingredient
in
its
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
so
good
,
"
said
Jeremiah
,
closing
the
house
door
,
and
taking
a
pretty
sharp
survey
of
the
smiling
visitor
in
his
turn
,
"
as
to
step
into
my
counting
-
house
.
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
right
,
I
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
petulantly
breaking
off
to
answer
the
voice
up
-
stairs
,
still
unsatisfied
,
though
Affery
was
there
,
speaking
in
persuasive
tones
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
tell
you
it
's
all
right
?
 
<EOS>
Preserve
the
woman
,
has
she
no
reason
at
all
in
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Timorous
,
"
remarked
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Timorous
?
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
turning
his
head
to
retort
,
as
he
went
before
with
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
"
More
courageous
than
ninety
men
in
a
hundred
,
sir
,
let
me
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Though
an
invalid
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Many
years
an
invalid
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
one
of
that
name
left
in
the
House
now
.
 
<EOS>
My
partner
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Saying
something
apologetically
as
he
crossed
the
hall
,
to
the
effect
that
at
that
time
of
night
they
were
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
any
one
,
and
were
always
shut
up
,
Mr
Flintwinch
led
the
way
into
his
own
office
,
which
presented
a
sufficiently
business
-
like
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
put
the
light
on
his
desk
,
and
said
to
the
stranger
,
with
his
wryest
twist
upon
him
,
"
Your
commands
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
MY
name
is
Blandois

<EOS>
"
Blandois

I
do
n't
know
it
,
"
said
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
possible
,
"
resumed
the
other
,
"
that
you
might
have
been
advised
from
Paris
---
"
   
"
We
have
had
no
advice
from
Paris
respecting
anybody
of
the
name
of
Blandois
,
"
said
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jeremiah
stood
in
his
favourite
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
The
smiling
Mr
Blandois
,
opening
his
cloak
to
get
his
hand
to
a
breast
-
pocket
,
paused
to
say
,
with
a
laugh
in
his
glittering
eyes
,
which
it
occurred
to
Mr
Flintwinch
were
too
near
together
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
like
a
friend
of
mine
!
 
<EOS>
Not
so
identically
the
same
as
I
supposed
when
I
really
did
for
the
moment
<EOS>
take
you
to
be
the
same
in
the
dusk
---
for
which
I
ought
to
apologise
;
permit
me
to
do
so
;
a
readiness
to
confess
my
errors
is
,
I
hope
,
a
part
of
the
frankness
of
my
character
---
still
,
however
,
uncommonly
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
"
said
Jeremiah
,
perversely
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
not
received
any
letter
of
advice
from
anywhere
respecting
anybody
of
the
name
of
Blandois
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
JUST
so
,
"
said
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
,
not
at
all
put
out
by
this
omission
on
the
part
of
the
correspondents
of
the
house
of
Clennam
and
Co.
,
took
his
pocket
-
book
from
his
breast
-
pocket
,
selected
a
letter
from
that
receptacle
,
and
handed
it
to
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
you
are
well
acquainted
with
the
writing
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
letter
speaks
for
itself
,
and
requires
no
advice
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
far
more
competent
judge
of
such
affairs
than
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
my
misfortune
to
be
,
not
so
much
a
man
of
business
,
as
what
the
world
calls
(
arbitrarily
)
a
gentleman
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
took
the
letter
,
and
read
,
under
date
of
Paris
,
"
We
have
to
present
to
you

Also
have
to
add
that

Very

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
Take

<EOS>
To

Probably

<EOS>
"
That
I
came
over

the
delayed

returned
Mr
Blandois
,
passing
his
white
hand
down
his
high
-
hooked
nose
,
"
I
know
to
the
cost
of
my

the
detestable

intolerable

racked
them
both

You
see
me
in
the
plight

which
I
came
out
of

this
half

I

"
   
<EOS>
Swagger
and
an
air
of
authorised
condescension
do
so
much
,
that
Mr
Flintwinch
had
already
begun
to
think
this
a
highly
gentlemanly
personage
.
 
<EOS>
Not
the
less
unyielding
with
him
on
that
account
,
he
scraped
his
chin
and
said
,
what
could
he
have
the
honour
of
doing
for
Mr
Blandois
to
-
night
,
out
of
business
hours
?
   
<EOS>
"
Faith
!
"
returned
that
gentleman
,
shrugging
his
cloaked
shoulders
,
"
I
must
change
,
and
eat
and
drink
,
and
be
lodged
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Have
the
kindness
to
advise
me
,
a
total
stranger
,
where
,
and
<EOS>
money
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference

The

the
better

<EOS>
Next
door

that
's
all

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
was
slowly
beginning
,
"
For
a
gentleman
of
your
habits
,
there
is
not
in
this
immediate
neighbourhood
any
hotel
---
"
when
Mr
Blandois
took
him
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
much
for
my
habits
!
 
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
"
snapping
his
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
citizen
of
the
world
has
no
habits
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
am
,
in
my
poor
way
,
a
gentleman
,
by
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
deny
,
but
I
have
no
unaccommodating
prejudiced
habits
.
 
<EOS>
A
clean
room
,
a
hot
dish
for
dinner
,
and
a
bottle
of
not
absolutely
poisonous
wine
,
are
all
I
want
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
want
that
much
without
the
trouble
of
going
one
unnecessary
inch
to
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
with
more
than
his
usual
deliberation
,
as
he
met
,
for
a
moment
,
Mr
Blandois
'
shining
eyes
,
which
were
restless
;
"
there
is
a
coffee
-
house
and
tavern
close
here
,
which
,
so
far
,
I
can
recommend
;
but
there
's
no
style
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
dispense
with
style
!
"
said
Mr
Blandois
,
waving
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
me
the
honour
to
show
me
the
house
,
and
introduce
me
there
(
if
I
am
not
too
troublesome
)
,
and
I
shall
be
infinitely
obliged
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
upon
this
,
looked
up
his
hat
,
and
lighted
Mr
Blandois
across
the
hall
again
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
put
the
candle
on
a
bracket
,
where
the
dark
old
panelling
almost
served
as
an
extinguisher
for
it
,
he
bethought
himself
of
going
up
to
tell
the
invalid
that
he
would
not
be
absent
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
Oblige
me
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
on
his
saying
so
,
"
by
presenting
my
card
of
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Do
me
the
favour
to
add
that
I
shall
be
happy
to
wait
on
Mrs
Clennam
,
to
offer
my
personal
compliments
,
and
to
apologise
for
having
occasioned
any
agitation
in
this
tranquil
corner
,
if
it
should
suit
her
convenience
to
endure
the
presence
of
a
stranger
for
a
few
minutes
,
after
he
shall
have
changed
his
wet
clothes
and
fortified
himself
with
something
to
eat
and
drink
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jeremiah
made
all
despatch
,
and
said
,
on
his
return
,
"
She
'll
be
glad
to
see
you
,
sir
;
but
,
being
conscious
that
her
sick
room
has
no
attractions
,
wishes
me
to
say
that
she
wo
n't
hold
you
to
your
offer
,
<EOS>
in
case
you
should
think
better
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
think
better
of
it
,
"
returned
the
gallant
Blandois
,
"
would
be
to
slight
a
lady
;
to
slight
a
lady
would
be
to
be
deficient
in
chivalry
towards
the
sex
;
and
chivalry
towards
the
sex
is
a
part
of
my
character
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
expressing
himself
,
he
threw
the
draggled
skirt
of
his
cloak
over
his
shoulder
,
and
accompanied
Mr
Flintwinch
to
the
tavern
;
taking
up
on
the
road
a
porter
who
was
waiting
with
his
portmanteau
on
the
outer
side
of
the
gateway
.
   
<EOS>
The
house
was
kept
in
a
homely
manner
,
and
the
condescension
of
Mr
Blandois
was
infinite
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
fill
to
inconvenience
the
little
bar
in
which
the
widow
landlady
and
her
two
daughters
received
him
;
it
was
much
too
big
for
the
narrow
wainscoted
room
with
a
bagatelle
-
board
in
it
,
that
was
first
proposed
for
his
reception
;
it
perfectly
swamped
the
little
private
holiday
sitting
-
room
of
the
family
,
which
was
finally
given
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
in
dry
clothes
and
scented
linen
,
with
sleeked
hair
,
a
great
ring
on
each
forefinger
and
a
massive
show
of
watch
-
chain
,
Mr
Blandois
waiting
for
his
dinner
,
lolling
on
a
window
-
seat
with
his
knees
drawn
up
,
looked
(
for
all
the
difference
in
the
setting
of
the
jewel
)
fearfully
and
wonderfully
like
a
certain
Monsieur
Rigaud
who
had
once
so
waited
for
his
breakfast
,
lying
on
the
stone
ledge
of
the
iron
grating
of
a
cell
in
a
villainous
dungeon
at
Marseilles
.
   
<EOS>
His
greed
at
dinner
,
too
,
was
closely
in
keeping
with
the
greed
of
Monsieur
Rigaud
at
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
His
avaricious
manner
of
collecting
all
the
eatables
about
him
,
and
devouring
some
with
his
eyes
while
devouring
others
with
his
jaws
,
was
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
His
utter
disregard
of
other
people
,
as
shown
in
his
way
of
tossing
the
little
womanly
toys
of
furniture
about
,
flinging
favourite
cushions
under
his
boots
for
a
softer
rest
,
and
crushing
delicate
coverings
with
his
big
body
and
his
great
black
head
,
had
the
same
brute
selfishness
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
softly
moving
hands
that
were
so
busy
among
the
dishes
had
the
old
wicked
facility
of
the
hands
that
had
clung
to
the
bars
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
could
eat
no
more
,
and
sat
sucking
his
delicate
fingers
one
by
one
and
wiping
them
on
a
cloth
,
there
wanted
nothing
but
the
substitution
of
vine
-
leaves
to
finish
the
picture
.
   
<EOS>
On
this
man
,
with
his
moustache
going
up
and
his
nose
coming
down
in
that
most
evil
of
smiles
,
and
with
his
surface
eyes
looking
as
if
they
belonged
to
his
dyed
hair
,
and
had
had
their
natural
power
of
reflecting
light
stopped
by
some
similar
process
,
Nature
,
always
true
,
and
never
working
in
vain
,
had
set
the
mark
,
Beware
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
her
fault
,
if
the
warning
were
fruitless
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
never
to
blame
in
any
such
instance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
,
having
finished
his
repast
and
cleaned
his
fingers
,
took
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
,
and
,
lying
on
the
window
-
seat
again
,
smoked
it
out
at
his
leisure
,
occasionally
apostrophising
the
smoke
as
it
parted
from
his
thin
lips
in
a
thin
stream
:
   
<EOS>
"
Blandois
,
you
shall
turn
the
tables
on
society
,
my
little
child
.
<EOS>
Haha
!
 
<EOS>
Holy
blue
,
you
have
begun
well
,
Blandois
!
 
<EOS>
At
a
pinch
,
an
excellent
master
in
English
or
French
;
a
man
for
the
bosom
of
families
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
quick
perception
,
you
have
humour
<EOS>
,
you
have
ease
,
you
have
insinuating
manners
,
you
have
a
good
appearance
;
in
effect
,
you
are
a
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
you
shall
live
,
my
small
boy
,
and
a
gentleman
you
shall
die
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
win
,
however
the
game
goes
.
 
<EOS>
They
shall
all
confess
your
merit
,
Blandois
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
subdue
the
society
which
has
grievously
wronged
you
,
to
your
own
high
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
Death
of
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
high
spirited
by
right
and
by
nature
,
my
Blandois
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
such
soothing
murmurs
did
this
gentleman
smoke
out
his
cigar
and
drink
out
his
bottle
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Both
being
finished
,
he
shook
himself
into
a
sitting
attitude
;
and
with
the
concluding
serious
apostrophe
,
"
Hold
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
Blandois
,
you
ingenious
one
,
have
all
your
wits
about
you
!
"
arose
and
went
back
to
the
house
of
Clennam
and
Co.
   
<EOS>
He
was
received
at
the
door
by
Mistress
Affery
,
who
,
under
instructions
from
her
lord
,
had
lighted
up
two
candles
in
the
hall
and
a
third
on
the
staircase
,
and
who
conducted
him
to
Mrs
Clennam
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
was
prepared
there
,
and
such
little
company
arrangements
had
been
made
as
usually
attended
the
reception
of
expected
visitors
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
slight
on
the
greatest
occasion
,
never
extending
beyond
the
production
of
the
China
tea
-
service
,
and
the
covering
of
the
bed
with
a
sober
and
sad
drapery
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
there
was
the
bier
-
like
sofa
with
the
block
upon
it
,
and
the
figure
in
the
widow
's
dress
,
as
if
attired
for
execution
;
the
fire
topped
by
the
mound
of
damped
ashes
;
the
grate
with
its
second
little
mound
of
ashes
;
the
kettle
and
the
smell
of
black
dye
;
all
as
they
had
been
for
fifteen
years
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
presented
the
gentleman
commended
to
the
consideration
of
Clennam
and
Co.
 
Mrs
Clennam
,
who
had
the
letter
lying
before
her
,
bent
her
head
and
requested
him
to
sit
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
very
closely
at
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
but
natural
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
for
thinking
of
a
disabled
woman
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
Few
who
come
here
on
business
have
any
remembrance
to
bestow
on
one
so
removed
from
observation
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
idle
to
expect
that
they
should
have
.
 
<EOS>
Out
of
sight
,
out
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
am
grateful
for
the
exception
,
I
do
n't
complain
of
the
rule
.
 
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Blandois
,
in
his
most
gentlemanly
manner
,
was
afraid
he
had
disturbed
her
by
unhappily
presenting
himself
at
such
an
unconscionable
time
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
he
had
already
offered
his
best
apologies
to
Mr
---
he
begged
pardon
---
but
by
name
had
not
the
distinguished
honour
---
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Flintwinch

been
connected
with
the
House
many
years

Mr
Blandois
was
Mr
Flintwinch
's
most
obedient
humble
servant
.
 
<EOS>
He
entreated
Mr
Flintwinch
to
receive
the
assurance
of
his
profoundest
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
husband
being
dead
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
"
and
my
son
preferring
another
pursuit
<EOS>
,
our
old
House
has
no
other
representative
in
these
days
than
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
   
"
What
do
you
call
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
was
the
surly
demand
of
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
head
of
two
men
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
sex
disqualifies
me
,
"
she
proceeded
with
merely
a
slight
turn
of
her
eyes
in
jeremiah
's
direction
,
"
from
taking
a
responsible
part
in
the
business
,
even
if
I
had
the
ability
;
and
therefore
Mr
Flintwinch
combines
my
interest
with
his
own
,
and
conducts
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
;
but
some
of
our
old
friends
(
principally
the
writers
of
this
letter
)
have
the
kindness
not
to
forget
us
,
and
we
retain
the
power
of
doing
what
they
entrust
to
us
as
efficiently
as
we
ever
did
.
 
<EOS>
This
however
is
not
interesting
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
English
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Faith
,
madam
,
no
<EOS>
;
I
am
neither
born
nor
bred
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
In
effect
,
I
am
of
no
country
,
"
said
Mr
Blandois
,
stretching
out
his
leg
and
smiting
it
:
"
I
descend
from
half
-
a
-
dozen
countries
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
much
about
the
world
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
madam
,
I
have
been
here
and
there
and
everywhere
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
ties
,
probably
.
 
<EOS>
Are
not
married
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Blandois
,
with
an
ugly
fall
of
his
eyebrows
,
"
I
adore
your
sex
,
but
I
am
not
married
---
never
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
,
who
stood
at
the
table
near
him
,
pouring
out
the
tea
,
happened
in
her
dreamy
state
to
look
at
him
as
he
said
these
words
,
and
to
fancy
that
she
caught
an
expression
in
his
eyes
which
attracted
her
own
eyes
so
that
she
could
not
get
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
effect
of
this
fancy
was
to
keep
her
staring
at
him
with
the
tea
-
pot
in
her
hand
,
not
only
to
her
own
great
uneasiness
,
but
manifestly
to
his
,
too
;
and
,
through
them
both
,
to
Mrs
Clennam
's
and
Mr
Flintwinch
's
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
a
few
ghostly
moments
supervened
,
when
they
were
all
confusedly
staring
without
knowing
why
.
   
<EOS>
"
Affery
,
"
her
mistress
was
the
first
to
say
,
"
what
is
the
matter
with
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Mistress
Affery
,
with
her
disengaged
left
hand
extended
towards
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
good
woman
mean
?
"
cried
Mr
Blandois
,
turning
white
,
hot
,
and
slowly
rising
with
a
look
of
such
deadly
wrath
that
it
contrasted
surprisingly
with
the
slight
force
of
his
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
possible
to
understand
this
good
creature
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
NOT
possible
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
screwing
himself
rapidly
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
do
n't
know
what
she
means
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
an
idiot
,
a
wanderer
in
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
shall
have
a
dose
,
she
shall
have
such
a
dose
!
 
<EOS>
Get
along
with
you
,
my
woman
,
"
he
added
in
her
ear
,
"
get
along
with
you
,
while
you
know
you
're
Affery
,
and
before
you
're
shaken
to
yeast
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
,
sensible
of
the
danger
in
which
her
identity
stood
,
relinquished
the
tea
-
pot
as
her
husband
seized
it
,
put
her
apron
over
her
head
,
and
in
a
twinkling
vanished
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitor
gradually
broke
into
a
smile
,
and
sat
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
excuse
her
,
Mr
Blandois
,
"
said
Jeremiah
,
pouring
out
the
tea
himself
,
"
she
's
failing
and
breaking
up
<EOS>
;
that
's
what
she
's
about
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
take
sugar
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
"
   
"
Thank
you
,
no
tea
for
me
.
<EOS>
---
Pardon
<EOS>
my
observing
it
,
but
that
's
a
very
remarkable
watch
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
tea
-
table
was
drawn
up
near
the
sofa
,
with
a
small
interval
between
it
and
Mrs
Clennam
's
own
particular
table
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
in
his
gallantry
had
risen
to
hand
that
lady
her
tea
(
her
dish
of
toast
was
already
there
)
,
and
it
was
in
placing
the
cup
conveniently
within
her
reach
that
the
watch
,
lying
before
her
as
it
always
did
,
attracted
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
looked
suddenly
up
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
be
permitted
?
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
A
fine
old
-
fashioned
watch
,
"
he
said
,
taking
it
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heavy
for
use
,
but
massive
and
genuine
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
partiality
for
everything
genuine
.
 
<EOS>
Such
as
I
am
,
I
am
genuine
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Hah
!
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
's
watch
with
two
cases
in
the
old
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
remove
it
from
the
outer
case
?
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Aye
?
 
<EOS>
An
old
silk
watch
-
lining
,
worked
with
beads
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
seen
these
among
old
Dutch
people
and
Belgians
.
 
<EOS>
Quaint
things
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
old
-
fashioned
,
too
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
so
old
as
the
watch
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Extraordinary
how
they
used
to
complicate
these
cyphers
!
"
remarked
Mr
Blandois
,
glancing
up
with
his
own
smile
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
is
this
D*N*F
?
<EOS>
It
might
be
almost
anything
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Those
are
the
letters
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
who
had
been
observantly
pausing
all
this
time
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
his
hand
,
and
his
mouth
open
ready
to
swallow
the
contents
,
began
to
do
so
:
always
entirely
filling
his
mouth
before
he
emptied
it
at
a
gulp
;
and
always
deliberating
again
before
he
refilled
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
D*N*F
was
some
tender
,
lovely
,
fascinating
fair
-
creature
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
"
observed
Mr
Blandois
,
as
he
snapped
on
the
case
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
adore
her
memory
on
the
assumption
.
 
<EOS>
Unfortunately
for
my
peace
of
mind
,
I
adore
but
too
readily
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
vice
,
it
may
be
a
virtue
,
but
adoration
of
female
beauty
and
merit
constitutes
three
parts
of
my
character
,
madam
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
had
by
this
time
poured
himself
out
another
cup
of
tea
,
which
he
was
swallowing
in
gulps
as
before
,
with
his
eyes
directed
to
the
invalid
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
heart
-
free
here
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
she
returned
to
Mr
Blandois
.
<EOS>
"
Those
letters
are
not
intended
,
I
believe
,
for
the
initials
of
any
name
.
"
   
"
Of
a
motto
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Mr
Blandois
,
casually
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
a
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
always
stood
,
I
believe
,
for
Do
Not
Forget
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
naturally
,
"
said
Mr
Blandois
,
replacing
the
watch
and
stepping
backward
to
his
former
chair
,
"
you
do
not
forget
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
finishing
his
tea
,
not
only
took
a
longer
gulp
than
he
had
taken
yet
,
but
made
his
succeeding
pause
under
new
circumstances
:
that
is
to
say
,
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
cup
held
still
at
his
lips
,
while
his
eyes
were
still
directed
at
the
invalid
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
that
force
of
face
,
and
that
concentrated
air
of
collecting
her
firmness
or
obstinacy
,
which
represented
in
her
case
what
would
have
been
gesture
and
action
in
another
,
as
she
replied
with
her
deliberate
strength
of
speech
:
"
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
I
do
not
forget
.
 
<EOS>
To
lead
a
life
as
monotonous
as
mine
has
been
during
many
years
,
is
not
the
way
to
forget
.
 
<EOS>
To
lead
a
life
of
self
-
correction
is
not
the
way
to
forget
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sensible
of
having
(
as
we
all
have
,
every
one
of
us
,
all
the
children
of
Adam
!
)
<EOS>
offences
to
expiate
and
peace
to
make
<EOS>
,
does
not
justify
the
desire
to
forget
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
have
long
dismissed
it
,
and
I
neither
forget
nor
wish
to
forget
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
who
had
latterly
been
shaking
the
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
his
tea
-
cup
,
round
and
round
,
here
gulped
it
down
,
and
putting
the
cup
in
the
tea
-
tray
,
as
done
with
,
turned
his
eyes
upon
Mr
Blandois
as
if
to
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
that
?
   
<EOS>
"
All
expressed
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Blandois
,
with
his
smoothest
bow
and
his
white
hand
on
his
breast
,
"
by
the
word
"
naturally
,
"
which
I
am
proud
to
have
had
sufficient
apprehension
and
appreciation
<EOS>
(
but
without
appreciation
I
could
not
be
Blandois
)
to
employ
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
she
returned
,
"
if
I
doubt
the
likelihood
of
a
gentleman
of
pleasure
,
and
change
,
and
politeness
,
accustomed
to
court
and
to
be
courted
---
"
   
"
Oh
madam
!
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
<EOS>
If
I
doubt
the
likelihood
of
such
a
character
quite
comprehending
what
belongs
to
mine
in
my
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
obtrude
doctrine
upon
you
,
"
she
looked
at
the
rigid
pile
of
hard
pale
books
before
her
,
"
(
for
you
go
your
own
way
,
and
the
consequences
are
on
your
own
head
)
<EOS>
,
I
will
say
this
much
:
<EOS>
that
I
shape
my
course
by
pilots
,
strictly
by
proved
and
tried
pilots
,
under
whom
I
can
not
be
shipwrecked
<EOS>
---
can
not
be
---
and
that
if
I
were
unmindful
of
the
admonition
conveyed
in
those
three
letters
,
I
should
not
be
half
as
chastened
as
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
curious
how
she
seized
the
occasion
to
argue
with
some
invisible
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
with
her
own
better
sense
,
always
turning
upon
herself
and
her
own
deception
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
forgot
my
ignorances
in
my
life
of
health
and
freedom
,
I
might
complain
of
the
life
to
which
I
am
now
condemned
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
do
;
I
never
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
forgot
that
this
scene
,
the
Earth
,
is
expressly
meant
to
be
a
scene
of
gloom
,
and
hardship
,
and
dark
trial
,
for
the
creatures
who
are
made
out
of
its
dust
,
I
might
have
some
tenderness
for
its
vanities
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
such
tenderness
.
<EOS>
If
I
did
not
know
that
we
are
,
every
one
,
the
subject
(
most
justly
the
subject
)
of
a
wrath
that
must
be
satisfied
,
and
against
which
mere
actions
are
nothing
,
I
might
repine
at
the
difference
between
me
,
imprisoned
here
,
and
the
people
who
pass
that
gateway
yonder
.
<EOS>
But
I
take
it
as
a
grace
and
favour
to
be
elected
to
make
the
satisfaction
I
am
making
here
,
to
know
what
I
know
for
certain
here
,
and
to
work
out
what
I
have
worked
out
here
.
 
<EOS>
My
affliction
might
otherwise
have
had
no
meaning
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
I
would
forget
,
and
I
do
forget
,
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
I
am
contented
,
and
say
it
is
better
with
me
than
with
millions
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
spoke
these
words
,
she
put
her
hand
upon
the
watch
,
and
restored
it
to
the
precise
spot
on
her
little
table
which
it
always
occupied
.
 
<EOS>
With
her
touch
lingering
upon
it
,
she
sat
for
some
moments
afterwards
,
looking
at
it
steadily
and
half
-
defiantly
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
,
during
this
exposition
,
had
been
strictly
attentive
,
keeping
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
lady
,
and
thoughtfully
stroking
his
moustache
with
his
two
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
had
been
a
little
fidgety
,
and
now
struck
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
there
!
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
quite
understood
,
Mrs
Clennam
,
and
you
have
spoken
piously
and
well
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
,
I
suspect
,
is
not
of
a
pious
cast
.
"
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
sir
!
"
that
gentleman
protested
,
snapping
his
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
pardon
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
part
of
my
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sensitive
,
ardent
,
conscientious
,
and
imaginative
.
 
<EOS>
A
sensitive
,
ardent
,
conscientious
,
and
imaginative
man
,
Mr
Flintwinch
,
must
be
that
,
or
nothing
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
inkling
of
suspicion
in
Mr
Flintwinch
's
face
that
he
might
be
nothing
,
as
he
swaggered
out
of
his
chair
<EOS>
(
it
was
characteristic
of
this
man
,
as
it
is
of
all
men
similarly
marked
,
that
whatever
he
did
,
he
overdid
,
though
it
were
sometimes
by
only
a
hairsbreadth
)
,
and
approached
to
take
his
leave
of
Mrs
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
what
will
appear
to
you
the
egotism
of
a
sick
old
woman
,
sir
,
"
she
then
said
,
"
though
really
through
your
accidental
allusion
,
I
have
been
led
away
into
the
subject
of
myself
and
my
infirmities

<EOS>
Being
so
considerate
as
to
visit
me
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
be
likewise
so
considerate
as
to
overlook
that
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
compliment
me
,
if
you
please
.
"
 
<EOS>
For
he
was
evidently
going
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Flintwinch
will
be
happy
to
render
you
any
service
,
and
I
hope
your
stay
in
this
city
may
prove
agreeable
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
thanked
her
,
and
kissed
his
hand
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
an
old
room
,
"
he
remarked
,
with
a
sudden
sprightliness
of
manner
,
looking
round
when
he
got
near
the
door
,
"
I
have
been
so
interested
that
I
have
not
observed
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
genuine
old
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
genuine
old
house
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
with
her
frozen
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
place
of
no
pretensions
,
but
a
piece
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Faith
!
"
cried
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
Mr
Flintwinch
would
do
me
the
favour
to
take
me
through
the
rooms
on
my
way
out
,
he
could
hardly
oblige
me
more
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
house
is
a
weakness
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
many
weaknesses
,
but
none
greater
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
and
study
the
picturesque
in
all
its
varieties
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
called
picturesque
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
merit
to
be
picturesque
<EOS>
---
I
have
greater
merits
,
perhaps
---
but
I
may
be
,
by
an
accident
.
 
<EOS>
Sympathy
,
sympathy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
beforehand
,
Mr
Blandois
,
that
you
'll
find
it
very
dingy
and
very
bare
,
"
said
Jeremiah
,
taking
up
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
worth
your
looking
at
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Blandois
,
smiting
him
in
a
friendly
manner
on
the
back
,
only
laughed
;
so
the
said
Blandois
kissed
his
hand
again
to
Mrs
Clennam
,
and
they
went
out
of
the
room
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
care
to
go
up
-
stairs
?
"
<EOS>
said
Jeremiah
,
on
the
landing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
Mr
Flintwinch
;
if
not
tiresome
to
you
,
I
shall
be
ravished
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
therefore
,
wormed
himself
up
the
staircase
,
and
Mr
Blandois
followed
close
.
 
<EOS>
They
ascended
to
the
great
garret
bed
-
room
which
Arthur
had
occupied
on
the
night
of
his
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
,
Mr
Blandois
!
"
said
Jeremiah
,
showing
it
,
"
I
hope
you
may
think
that
worth
coming
so
high
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
I
do
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
being
enraptured
,
they
walked
through
other
garrets
and
passages
,
and
came
down
the
staircase
again
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
Mr
Flintwinch
had
remarked
that
he
never
found
the
visitor
looking
at
any
room
,
after
throwing
one
quick
glance
around
,
but
always
found
the
visitor
looking
at
him
,
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
discovery
in
his
thoughts
,
he
turned
about
on
the
staircase
for
another
experiment
.
 
<EOS>
He
met
his
eyes
directly
;
and
on
the
instant
of
their
fixing
one
another
,
the
visitor
,
with
that
ugly
play
of
nose
and
moustache
,
laughed
(
as
he
had
done
at
every
similar
moment
since
they
left
Mrs
Clennam
's
chamber
)
<EOS>
a
diabolically
silent
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
As
a
much
shorter
man
than
the
visitor
,
Mr
Flintwinch
was
at
the
physical
disadvantage
of
being
thus
disagreeably
leered
at
from
a
height
;
and
as
he
went
first
down
the
staircase
,
and
was
usually
a
step
or
two
lower
than
the
other
,
this
disadvantage
was
at
the
time
increased
.
 
<EOS>
He
postponed
looking
at
Mr
Blandois
again
until
this
accidental
inequality
was
removed
by
their
having
entered
the
late
Mr
Clennam
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
then
twisting
himself
suddenly
round
upon
him
,
he
found
his
look
unchanged
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
most
admirable
old
house
,
"
smiled
Mr
Blandois
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
mysterious
.
<EOS>
Do
you
never
hear
any
haunted
noises
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Noises
,
"
returned
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
see
any
devils
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
grimly
screwing
himself
at
his
questioner
,
"
not
any
that
introduce
themselves
under
that
name
and
in
that
capacity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Haha
!
 
<EOS>
A
portrait
here
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
(
Still
looking
at
Mr
Flintwinch
,
as
if
he
were
the
portrait
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
portrait
,
sir
,
as
you
observe
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
the
subject
,
Mr
Flintwinch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
deceased
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
.
"
<EOS>
"
Former
owner
of
the
remarkable
watch
,
perhaps
?
"
said
the
visitor
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
who
had
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
portrait
,
twisted
himself
about
again
,
and
again
found
himself
the
subject
of
the
same
look
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr
Blandois
,
"
he
replied
tartly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
his
,
and
his
uncle
's
before
him
,
and
Lord
knows
who
before
him
;
and
that
's
all
I
can
tell
you
of
its
pedigree
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
strongly
marked
character
,
Mr
Flintwinch
,
our
friend
up
-
stairs
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Jeremiah
,
twisting
himself
at
the
visitor
again
,
as
he
did
during
the
whole
of
this
dialogue
,
like
some
screw
-
machine
that
fell
short
of
its
grip
;
for
the
other
never
changed
,
and
he
always
felt
obliged
to
retreat
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
remarkable
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Great
fortitude
---
great
strength
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
must
have
been
very
happy
,
"
said
Blandois
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
demanded
Mr
Flintwinch
,
with
another
screw
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
shook
his
right
forefinger
towards
the
sick
room
,
and
his
left
forefinger
towards
the
portrait
,
and
then
,
putting
his
arms
akimbo
and
striding
his
legs
wide
apart
,
stood
smiling
down
at
Mr
Flintwinch
with
the
advancing
nose
and
the
retreating
moustache
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
happy
as
most
other
married
people
,
I
suppose
,
"
returned
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
secrets
in
all
families
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Secrets
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Blandois
,
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
it
again
,
my
son
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
replied
Mr
Flintwinch
,
upon
whom
he
had
swelled
himself
so
suddenly
that
Mr
Flintwinch
found
his
face
almost
brushed
by
the
dilated
chest
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
there
are
secrets
in
all
families
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
there
are
,
"
cried
the
other
,
clapping
him
on
both
shoulders
,
and
rolling
him
backwards
and
forwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
Haha
!
 
<EOS>
you
are
right
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
are
!
 
<EOS>
Secrets
!
 
<EOS>
Holy
Blue
!
 
<EOS>
There
are
the
devil
's
own
secrets
in
some
families
,
Mr
Flintwinch
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
,
after
clapping
Mr
Flintwinch
on
both
shoulders
several
times
,
as
if
in
a
friendly
and
humorous
way
he
were
rallying
him
on
a
joke
he
had
made
,
he
threw
up
his
arms
,
threw
back
his
head
,
hooked
his
hands
together
behind
it
,
and
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
Mr
Flintwinch
to
try
another
screw
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
laugh
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
favour
me
with
the
candle
a
moment
,
"
he
said
,
when
he
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
have
a
look
at
the
husband
of
the
remarkable
lady
.
<EOS>
Hah
!
<EOS>
"
holding
up
the
light
at
arm
's
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
decided
expression
of
face
here
too
,
though
not
of
the
same
character
.
 
<EOS>
Looks
as
if
he
were
saying
,
what
is
it
---
<EOS>
Do
Not
Forget
---
<EOS>
does
he
not
,
Mr
Flintwinch
?
   
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
sir
,
he
does
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
returned
the
candle
,
he
looked
at
him
once
more
;
and
then
,
leisurely
strolling
out
with
him
into
the
hall
,
declared
it
to
be
a
charming
old
house
indeed
,
and
one
which
had
so
greatly
pleased
him
that
he
would
not
have
missed
inspecting
it
for
a
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Throughout
these
singular
freedoms
on
the
part
of
Mr
Blandois
,
which
involved
a
general
alteration
in
his
demeanour
,
making
it
much
coarser
and
rougher
,
much
more
violent
and
audacious
than
before
,
Mr
Flintwinch
,
whose
leathern
face
was
not
liable
to
many
changes
,
preserved
its
immobility
intact
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
now
appearing
perhaps
,
to
have
been
left
hanging
a
trifle
too
long
before
that
friendly
operation
of
cutting
down
,
he
outwardly
maintained
an
equable
composure
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
brought
their
survey
to
a
close
in
the
little
room
at
the
side
of
the
hall
,
and
he
stood
there
,
eyeing
Mr
Blandois
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
are
so
well
satisfied
,
sir
,
"
was
his
calm
remark
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
expect
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
seem
to
be
quite
in
good
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
admirable
spirits
,
"
returned
Blandois
.
 
<EOS>
"
Word
of
honour
!
 
<EOS>
never
more
refreshed
in
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
have
presentiments
,
Mr
Flintwinch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
sure
that
I
know
what
you
mean
by
the
term
,
sir
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
,
in
this
case
,
Mr
Flintwinch
,
undefined
anticipations
of
pleasure
to
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
'm
sensible
of
such
a
sensation
at
present
,
"
returned
Mr
Flintwinch
with
the
utmost
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
should
find
it
coming
on
,
I
'll
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
,
"
said
Blandois
,
"
I
,
my
son
,
have
a
presentiment
to
-
night
that
we
shall
be
well
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
find
it
coming
on
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
no
,
"
returned
Mr
Flintwinch
,
deliberately
inquiring
of
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
strong
presentiment
that
we
shall
become
intimately
acquainted
.
<EOS>
---
You
have
no
feeling
of
that
sort
yet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
,
taking
him
by
both
shoulders
again
,
rolled
him
about
a
little
in
his
former
merry
way
,
then
drew
his
arm
through
his
own
,
and
invited
him
to
come
off
and
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
like
a
dear
deep
old
dog
as
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
Without
a
moment
's
indecision
,
Mr
Flintwinch
accepted
the
invitation
,
and
they
went
out
to
the
quarters
where
the
traveller
was
lodged
,
through
a
heavy
rain
which
had
rattled
on
the
windows
,
roofs
,
and
pavements
,
ever
since
nightfall
.
 
<EOS>
The
thunder
and
lightning
had
long
ago
passed
over
,
but
the
rain
was
furious
.
 
<EOS>
On
their
arrival
at
Mr
Blandois
'
room
,
a
bottle
of
port
wine
was
ordered
by
that
gallant
gentleman
;
who
(
crushing
every
pretty
thing
he
could
collect
,
in
the
soft
disposition
of
his
dainty
figure
)
coiled
himself
upon
the
window
-
seat
,
while
Mr
Flintwinch
took
a
chair
opposite
to
him
,
with
the
table
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Blandois
proposed
having
the
largest
glasses
in
the
house
,
to
which
Mr
Flintwinch
assented
.
 
<EOS>
The
bumpers
filled
,
Mr
Blandois
,
with
a
roystering
gaiety
,
clinked
the
top
of
his
glass
against
the
bottom
of
Mr
Flintwinch
's
,
and
the
bottom
of
his
glass
against
the
top
of
Mr
Flintwinch
's
,
and
drank
to
the
intimate
acquaintance
he
foresaw
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
gravely
pledged
him
,
and
drank
all
the
wine
he
could
get
,
and
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
As
often
as
Mr
Blandois
clinked
glasses
(
which
was
at
every
replenishment
)
,
Mr
Flintwinch
stolidly
did
his
part
of
the
clinking
,
and
would
have
stolidly
done
his
companion
's
part
of
the
wine
as
well
as
his
own
:
being
,
except
in
the
article
of
palate
,
a
mere
cask
.
   
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mr
Blandois
found
that
to
pour
port
wine
into
the
reticent
Flintwinch
was
,
not
to
open
him
but
to
shut
him
up
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
perfect
ability
to
go
on
all
night
;
or
,
if
occasion
were
,
all
next
day
and
all
next
night
;
whereas
Mr
Blandois
soon
grew
indistinctly
conscious
of
swaggering
too
fiercely
and
boastfully
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
terminated
the
entertainment
at
the
end
of
the
third
bottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
draw
upon
us
to
-
morrow
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
with
a
business
-
like
face
at
parting
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
Cabbage
,
"
returned
the
other
,
taking
him
by
the
collar
with
both
hands
,
"
I
'll
draw
upon
you
;
have
no
fear
.
 
<EOS>
Adieu
,
my
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
Receive
at
parting
;
"
here
he
gave
him
a
southern
embrace
,
and
kissed
him
soundly
on
both
cheeks
;
"
the
word
of
a
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
By
a
thousand
Thunders
,
you
shall
see
me
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
not
present
himself
next
day
,
though
the
letter
of
advice
came
duly
to
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Inquiring
after
him
at
night
,
Mr
Flintwinch
found
,
with
surprise
,
that
he
had
paid
his
bill
and
gone
back
to
the

Nevertheless
,
Jeremiah
scraped
out
of
his
cogitating
face
a
lively
conviction
that
Mr
Blandois
would
keep
his
word
on
this
occasion
,
and
would
be
seen
again

Spirit
 
<EOS>
Anybody
may
pass
,
any
day
,
in
the
thronged
thoroughfares
of
the
metropolis
,
some
meagre
,
wrinkled
,
yellow
old
man
(
who
might
be
supposed
to
have
dropped
from
the
stars
,
if
there
were
any
star
in
the
Heavens
dull
enough
to
be
suspected
of
casting
off
so
feeble
a
spark
)
,
creeping
along
with
a
scared
air
,
as
though
bewildered
and
a
little
frightened
by
the
noise
and
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
This
old
man
is
always
a
little
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
ever
a
big
old
man
,
he
has
shrunk
into
a
little
old
man
;
if
he
were
always
a
little
old
man
,
he
has
dwindled
into
a
less
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
His
coat
is
a
colour
,
and
cut
,
that
never
was
the
mode
anywhere
,
at
any
period
.
 
<EOS>
Clearly
,
it
was
not
made
for
him
,
or
for
any
individual
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
Some
wholesale
contractor
measured
Fate
for
five
thousand
coats
of
such
quality
,
and
Fate
has
lent
this
old
coat
to
this
old
man
,
as
one
of
a
long
unfinished
line
of
many
old
men
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
always
large
dull
metal
buttons
,
similar
to
no
other
buttons
.
 
<EOS>
This
old
man
wears
a
hat
,
a
thumbed
and
napless
and
yet
an
obdurate
hat
,
which
has
never
adapted
itself
to
the
shape
of
his
poor
head
.
 
<EOS>
His
coarse
shirt
and
his
coarse
neckcloth
have
no
more
individuality
than
his
coat
and
hat
;
they
have
the
same
character
of
not
being
his
---
of
not
being
anybody
's
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
this
old
man
wears
these
clothes
with
a
certain
unaccustomed
air
of
being
dressed
and
elaborated
for
the
public
ways
;
as
though
he
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
time
in
a
nightcap
and
gown
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
like
the
country
mouse
in
the
second
year
of
a
famine
,
come
to
see
the
town
mouse
,
and
timidly
threading
his
way
to
the
town
-
mouse
's
lodging
through
a
city
of
cats
,
this
old
man
passes
in
the
streets
.
   
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
on
holidays
towards
evening
,
he
will
be
seen
to
walk
with
a
slightly
increased
infirmity
,
and
his
old
eyes
will
glimmer
with
a
moist
and
marshy
light
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
little
old
man
is
drunk
.
<EOS>
A
very
small
measure
will
overset
him
;
he
may
be
bowled
off
his
unsteady
legs
with
a
half
-
pint
pot
.
 
<EOS>
Some
pitying
acquaintance
---
chance
acquaintance
very
often
---
has
warmed
up
his
weakness
with
a
treat
of
beer
,
and
the
consequence
will
be
the
lapse
of
a
longer
time
than
usual
before
he
shall
pass
again
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
little
old
man
is
going
home
to
the
Workhouse
;
and
on
his
good
behaviour
they
do
not
let
him
out
often
(
though
methinks
they
might
,
considering
the
few
years
<EOS>
he
has
before
him
to
go
out
in
,
under
the
sun
)
;
and
on
his
bad
behaviour
they
shut
him
up
closer
than
ever
in
a
grove
of
two
score
and
nineteen
more
old
men
,
every
one
of
whom
smells
of
all
the
others
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
's
father
,
---
a
poor
little
reedy
piping
old
gentleman
,
like
a
worn
-
out
bird
;
who
had
been
in
what
he
called
the
music
-
binding
business
,
and
met
with
great
misfortunes
,
and
who
had
seldom
been
able
to
make
his
way
,
or
to
see
it
or
to
pay
it
,
or
to
do
anything
at
all
with
it
but
find
it
no
thoroughfare
,
---
had
retired
of
his
own
accord
to
the
Workhouse
which
was
appointed
by
law
to
be
the
Good
Samaritan
of
his
district
(
without
the
twopence
,
which
was
bad
political
economy
)
,
on
the
settlement
of
that
execution
which
had
carried
Mr
Plornish
to
the
Marshalsea
College
.
<EOS>
Previous
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
difficulties
coming
to
that
head
,
Old
Nandy
<EOS>
(
he
was
always
so
called
in
his
legal
Retreat
,
but
he
was
Old
Mr
Nandy
among
the
Bleeding
Hearts
)
<EOS>
had
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
Plornish
fireside
,
and
taken
his
bite
and
sup
out
of
the
Plornish
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
hoped
to
resume
that
domestic
position
when
Fortune
should
smile
upon
his
son
-
in
-
law
;
in
the
meantime
,
while
she
preserved
an
immovable
countenance
,
he
was
,
and
resolved
to
remain
,
one
of
these
little
old
men
in
a
grove
of
little
old
men
with
a
community
of
flavour
.
   
<EOS>
But
no
poverty
in
him
,
and
no
coat
on
him
that
never
was
the
mode
,
and
no
Old
Men
's
Ward
for
his
dwelling
-
place
,
could
quench
his
daughter
's
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
was
as
proud
of
her
father
's
talents
as
she
could
possibly
have
been
if
they
had
made
him
Lord
Chancellor
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
as
firm
a
belief
in
the
sweetness
and
propriety
of
his
manners
as
she
could
possibly
have
had
if
he
had
been
Lord
Chamberlain
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
little
old
man
knew
some
pale
and
vapid
little
songs
,
long
out
of
date
,
about
Chloe
,
and
Phyllis
,
and
Strephon
being
wounded
by
the
son
of
Venus
;
and
for
Mrs
Plornish
there
was
no
such
music
at
the
Opera
as
the
small
internal
flutterings
and
chirpings
wherein
he
would
discharge
himself
of
these
ditties
,
like
a
weak
,
little
,
broken
barrel
-
organ
,
ground
by
a
baby
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
"
days
out
,
"
those
flecks
of
light
in
his
flat
vista
of
pollard
old
men
,
"
it
was
at
once
Mrs
Plornish
's
delight
and
sorrow
,
when
he
was
strong
with
meat
,
and
had
taken
his
full
halfpenny
-
worth
of
porter
,
to
say
,
"
Sing
us
a
song
,
Father
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
would
give
them
Chloe
,
and
if
he
were
in
pretty
good
spirits
,
Phyllis
also
---
Strephon
he
had
hardly
been
up
to
since
he
went
into
retirement
---
and
then
would
Mrs
Plornish
declare
she
did
believe
there
never
was
such
a
singer
as
Father
,
and
wipe
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
If
he
had
come
from
Court
on
these
occasions
,
nay
,
if
he
had
been
the
noble
Refrigerator
come
home
triumphantly
from
a
foreign
court
to
be
presented
and
promoted
on
his
last
tremendous
failure
,
Mrs
Plornish
could
not
have
handed
him
with
greater
elevation
about
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Father
,
"
she
would
say
,
presenting
him
to
a
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
"
Father
will
soon
be
home
with
us
for
good
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
Father
looking
well
?
 
<EOS>
Father
's
a
sweeter
singer
than
ever
<EOS>
;
you
'd
never
have
forgotten
it
,
if
you
'd
aheard
him
just
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Plornish
,
he
had
married
these
articles
of
belief
in
marrying
Mr
Nandy
's
daughter
,
and
only
wondered
how
it
was
that
so
gifted
an
old
gentleman
had
not
made
a
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
This
he
attributed
,
after
much
reflection
,
to
his
musical
genius
not
having
been
scientifically
developed
in
his
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
why
,
"
argued
Mr
Plornish
,
"
why
go
a
-
binding
music
when
you
've
got
it
in
yourself
?
<EOS>
That
's
where
it
is
,
I
consider
.
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Nandy
had
a
patron
:
one
patron
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
patron
who
in
a
certain
sumptuous
way
---
an
apologetic
way
,
as
if
he
constantly
took
an
admiring
audience
to
witness
that
he
really
could
not
help
being
more
free
with
this
old
fellow
than
they
might
have
expected
,
on
account
of
his
simplicity
and
poverty
---
was
mightily
good
to
him
.
<EOS>
Old
Nandy
had
been
several
times
to
the
Marshalsea
College
,
communicating
with
his
son
-
in
-
law
during
his
short
durance
there
;
and
had
happily
acquired
to
himself
,
and
had
by
degrees
and
in
course
of
time
much
improved
,
the
patronage
of
the
Father
of
that
national
institution
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
this
old
man
as
if
the
old
man
held
of
him
in
vassalage
under
some
feudal
tenure
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
little
treats
and
teas
for
him
,
as
if
he
came
in
with
his
homage
from
some
outlying
district
where
the
tenantry
were
in
a
primitive
state
.
   
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
there
were
moments
when
he
could
by
no
means
have
sworn
but
that
the
old
man
was
an
ancient
retainer
of
his
,
who
had
been
meritoriously
faithful
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
mentioned
him
,
he
spoke
of
him
casually
as
his
old
pensioner
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
wonderful
satisfaction
in
seeing
him
,
and
in
commenting
on
his
decayed
condition
after
he
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
him
amazing
that
he
could
hold
up
his
head
at
all
,
poor
creature
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
the
Workhouse
,
sir
,
the
Union
;
no
privacy
,
no
visitors
,
no
station
,
no
respect
,
no
speciality
.
 
<EOS>
Most
deplorable
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
Old
Nandy
's
birthday
,
and
they
let
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
about
its
being
his
birthday
,
or
they
might
have
kept
him
in
;
for
such
old
men
should
not
be
born
.
 
<EOS>
He
passed
along
the
streets
as
usual
to
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
and
had
his
dinner
with
his
daughter
and
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
gave
them
Phyllis
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
concluded
,
when
Little
Dorrit
looked
in
to
see
how
they
all
were
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dorrit
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
here
's
Father
!
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
he
looking
nice
?
 
<EOS>
And
such
voice
he
's
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
smilingly
said
she
had
not
seen
him
this
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
they
're
rather
hard
on
poor
Father
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
with
a
lengthening
face
,
"
and
do
n't
let
him
have
half
as
much
change
and
fresh
air
as
would
benefit
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
'll
soon
be
home
for
good
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
,
Father
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
I
hope
so
.
 
<EOS>
In
good
time
,
please
God
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Plornish
delivered
himself
of
an
oration
which
he
invariably
made
,
word
for
word
the
same
,
on
all
such
opportunities
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
couched
in
the
following
terms
:
   
"
John
Edward
Nandy
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
While
there
's
a
ounce
of
wittles
or
drink
of
any
sort
in
this
present
roof
,
you
're
fully
welcome
to
your
share
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
While
there
's
a
handful
of
fire
or
a
mouthful
of
bed
in
this
present
roof
,
you
're
fully
welcome
to
your
share
on
it
.
   
<EOS>
If
so
be
as
there
should
be
nothing
in
this
present
roof
,
you
should
be
as
welcome
to
your
share
on
it
as
if
it
was
something
,
much
or
little
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
is
what
I
mean
<EOS>
and
so
I
do
n't
deceive
you
,
and
consequently
which
is
to
stand
out
<EOS>
is
to
entreat
of
you
,
and
therefore
why
not
do
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
To
this
lucid
address
,
which
Mr
Plornish
always
delivered
as
if
he
had
composed
it
(
<EOS>
as
no
doubt
he
had
)
with
enormous
labour
,
Mrs
Plornish
's
father
pipingly
replied
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
kindly
,
Thomas
,
and
I
know
your
intentions
well
,
which
is
the
same
I
thank
you
kindly
for
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
,
Thomas
.
 
<EOS>
Until
such
times
as
it
's
not
to
take
it
out
of
your
children
's
mouths
,
which
take
it
is
,
and
call
it
by
what
name
you
will
it
do
remain
and
equally
deprive
,
though
may
they
come
,
and
too
soon
they
can
not
come
,
no
Thomas
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
,
who
had
been
turning
her
face
a
little
away
with
a
corner
of
her
apron
in
her
hand
,
brought
herself
back
to
the
conversation
again
by
telling
Miss
Dorrit
that
Father
was
going
over
the
water
to
pay
his
respects
,
unless
she
knew
of
any
reason
why
it
might
not
be
agreeable
.
   
<EOS>
Her
answer
was
,
"
I
am
going
straight
home
,
and
if
he
will
come
with
me
I
shall
be
so
glad
to
take
care
of
him
---
so
glad
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
always
thoughtful
of
the
feelings
of
the
weak
,
"
of
his
company
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
Father
!
"
cried
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
you
a
gay
young
man
to
be
going
for
a
walk
along
with
Miss
Dorrit
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
tie
your
neck
-
handkerchief
into
a
regular
good
bow
,
for
you
're
a
regular
beau
yourself
,
Father
,
if
ever
there
was
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
filial
joke
his
daughter
smartened
him
up
,
and
gave
him
a
loving
hug
,
and
stood
at
the
door
with
her
weak
child
in
her
arms
,
and
her
strong
child
tumbling
down
the
steps
,
looking
after
her
little
old
father
as
he
toddled
away
with
his
arm
under
Little
Dorrit
's
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
at
a
slow
pace
,
and
Little
Dorrit
took
him
by
the
Iron
Bridge
and
sat
him
down
there
for
a
rest
,
and
they
looked
over
at
the
water
and
talked
about
the
shipping
,
and
the
old
man
mentioned
what
he
would
do
if
he
had
a
ship
full
of
gold
coming
home
to
him
<EOS>
(
his
plan
was
to
take
a
noble
lodging
for
the
Plornishes
and
himself
at
a
Tea
Gardens
,
and
live
there
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
,
attended
on
by
the
waiter
)
,
and
it
was
a
special
birthday
of
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
within
five
minutes
of
their
destination
,
when
,
at
the
corner
of
her
own
street
,
they
came
upon
Fanny
in
her
new
bonnet
bound
for
the
same

<EOS>
"
Why
,
good
gracious
me
,
Amy
!
"
cried
that
young
lady
starting
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
never
mean
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mean
what
,
Fanny
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
believed
a
great
deal
of
you
,
"
returned
the
young
lady
with
burning
indignation
,
"
but
I
do
n't
think
even
I
could
have
believed
this
,
of
even
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
!
"
cried
Little
Dorrit
,
wounded
and
astonished
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
Fanny
me
,
you
mean
little
thing
,
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
coming
along
the
open
streets
,
in
the
broad
light
of
day
,
with
a
Pauper
!
"
<EOS>
(
firing
off
the
last
word
as
if
it
were
a
ball
from
an
air
-
gun
)
.
<EOS>
"
O
Fanny
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
not
to
Fanny
me
,
for
I
'll
not
submit
to
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
such
a
thing
.
 
<EOS>
The
way
in
which
you
are
resolved
and
determined
to
disgrace
us
on
all
occasions
,
is
really
infamous
.
<EOS>
You
bad
little
thing
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
it
disgrace
anybody
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
very
gently
,
"
to
take
care
of
this
poor
old
man
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
miss
,
"
returned
her
sister
,
"
and
you
ought
to
know
it
does
.
<EOS>
And
you
do
know
it
does
,
and
you
do
it
because
you
know
it
does
.
<EOS>
The
principal
pleasure
of
your
life
is
to
remind
your
family
of
their
misfortunes
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
next
great
pleasure
of
your
existence
is
to
keep
low
company
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
however
,
if
you
have
no
sense
of
decency
,
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
please
to
allow
me
to
go
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
,
unmolested
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
,
she
bounced
across
to
the
opposite
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
disgrace
,
who
had
been
deferentially
bowing
a
pace
or
two
off
<EOS>
(
for
Little
Dorrit
had
let
his
arm
go
in
her
wonder
,
when
Fanny
began
)
,
and
who
had
been
hustled
and
cursed
by
impatient
passengers
for
stopping
the
way
,
rejoined
his
companion
,
rather
giddy
,
and
said
,
"
I
hope
nothing
's
wrong
with
your
honoured
father
,
Miss
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
there
's
nothing
the
matter
in
the
honoured
family
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
returned
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
your
arm
again
,
Mr
Nandy
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
be
there
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
she
talked
to
him
as
she
had
talked
before
,
and
they
came
to
the
Lodge
and
found
Mr
Chivery
on
the
lock
,
and
went
in
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
it
happened
that
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
was
sauntering
towards
the
Lodge
at
the
moment
when
they
were
coming
out
of
it
,
entering
the
prison
arm
in
arm
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
spectacle
of
their
approach
met
his
view
,
he
displayed
the
utmost
agitation
and
despondency
of
mind
;
and
---
altogether
regardless
of
Old
Nandy
,
who
,
making
his
reverence
,
stood
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
as
he
always
did
in
that
gracious
presence
---
turned
about
,
and
hurried
in
at
his
own
doorway
and
up
the
staircase
.
   
<EOS>
Leaving
the
old
unfortunate
,
whom
in
an
evil
hour
she
had
taken
under
her
protection
,
with
a
hurried
promise
to
return
to
him
directly
,
Little
Dorrit
hastened
after
her
father
,
and
,
on
the
staircase
,
found
Fanny
following
her
,
and
flouncing
up
with
offended
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
came
into
the
room
almost
together
;
and
the
Father
sat
down
in
his
chair
,
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
,
and
uttered
a
groan
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
proper
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
,
afflicted
Pa
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
hope
you
believe
me
,
Miss
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
father
?
"
cried
Little
Dorrit
,
bending
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
made
you
unhappy
,
father
?
 
<EOS>
Not
I
,
I
hope
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
hope
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
"
---
Fanny
paused
for
a
sufficiently
strong
expression
---
"
<EOS>
you
Common
-
minded
little
<EOS>
Amy
!
 
<EOS>
You
complete
prison
-
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
these
angry
reproaches
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
,
and
sobbed
out
,
raising
his
face
and
shaking
his
melancholy
head
at
his
younger
daughter
,
"
Amy
,
I
know
that
you
are
innocent
in
intention
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
cut
me
to
the
soul
.
"
<EOS>
"
Innocent
in
intention
!
"
the
implacable
Fanny
struck
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stuff
in
intention
!
 
<EOS>
Low
in
intention
!
 
<EOS>
Lowering
of
the
family
in
intention
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Little
Dorrit
,
pale
and
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
forgive
me
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
it
is
,
that
I
may
not
do
it
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
it
is
,
you
prevaricating
little
piece
of
goods
!
"
cried
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
already
,
<EOS>
so
do
n't
fly
in
the
face
of
Providence
by
attempting
to
deny
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Amy
,
"
said
the
father
,
passing
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
several
times
across
his
face
,
and
then
grasping
it
convulsively
in
the
hand
that
dropped
across
his
knee
,
"
I
have
done
what
I
could
to
keep
you
select
here
;
I
have
done
what
I
could
to
retain
you
a
position
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
succeeded
;
I
may
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
know
it
;
you
may
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
no
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
endured
everything
here
<EOS>
but
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
have
happily
been
spared
---
until
this
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
his
convulsive
grasp
unclosed
itself
,
and
he
put
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
again
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
on
the
ground
beside
him
,
with
her
imploring
hand
upon
his
arm
,
watched
him
remorsefully
.
 
<EOS>
Coming
out
of
his
fit
of
grief
,
he
clenched
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humiliation
<EOS>
I
have
happily
been
spared
until
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
Through
all
my
troubles
there
has
been
that
---
Spirit
in
myself
,
and
that
---
that
submission
to
it
,
if
I
may
use
the
term
,
in
those
about
me
,
which
has
spared
me
---
ha
---
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
day
,
this
minute
,
I
have
keenly
felt
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
otherwise
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
irrepressible
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Careering
and
prancing
about
with
a
Pauper
!
"
<EOS>
(
air
-
gun
again
)
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
dear
father
,
"
cried
Little
Dorrit
,
"
I
do
n't
justify
myself
for
having
wounded
your
dear
heart
---
no
!
 
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
I
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
She
clasped
her
hands
in
quite
an
agony
of
distress
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
nothing
but
beg
and
pray
you
to
be
comforted
and
overlook
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
I
had
not
known
that
you
were
kind
to
the
old
man
yourself
,
and
took
much
notice
of
him
,
and
were
always
glad
to
see
him
,
I
would
not
have
come
here
with
him
,
father
<EOS>
,
I
would
not
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
been
so
unhappy
as
to
do
,
I
have
done
in
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
wilfully
bring
a
tear
to
your
eyes
,
dear
love
!
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
her
heart
well
-
nigh
broken
,
"
for
anything
the
world
could
give
me
,
or
anything
it
could
take
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fanny
,
with
a
partly
angry
and
partly
repentant
sob
,
began
to
cry
herself
,
and
to
say
---
as
this
young
lady
always
said
when
she
was
half
in
passion
and
half
out
of
it
,
half
spiteful
with
herself
and
half
spiteful
with
everybody
else
---
that
she
wished
she
were
dead
.
   
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
in
the
meantime
took
his
younger
daughter
to
his
breast
,
and
patted
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
!
 
<EOS>
Say
no
more
,
Amy
,
say
no
more
,
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
forget
it
as
soon
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
"
with
hysterical
cheerfulness
<EOS>
,
"
I
---
shall
soon
be
able
to
dismiss
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
perfectly
true
,
my
dear
,
that
I
am
always
glad
to
see
my
old
pensioner
---
as
such
,
as
such
---
and
that
I
do
---
ha
---
extend
as
much
protection
and
kindness
to
the
---
hum
---
<EOS>
the
bruised
reed
<EOS>
---
I
trust
I
may
so
call
him
without
impropriety
---
as
in
my
circumstances
,
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
quite
true
that
this
is
the
case
,
my
dear
child
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
preserve
in
doing
this
,
if
I
may
---
ha
---
if
I
may
use
the
expression
---
Spirit
.
<EOS>
Becoming
Spirit
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
are
some
things
which
are
,
"
he
stopped
to
sob
,
"
irreconcilable
with
that
,
and
wound
that
---
wound
it
deeply
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
have
seen
my
good
Amy
attentive
,
and
---
ha
---
<EOS>
condescending
to
my
old
pensioner
---
it
is
not
that
that
hurts
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
if
I
am
to
close
the
painful
subject
by
being
explicit
,
that
I
have
seen
my
child
,
my
own
child
,
my
own
daughter
,
coming
into
this
College
out
of
the
public
streets
---
smiling
!
 
<EOS>
smiling
!
<EOS>
---
arm
in
arm
with
---
<EOS>
O
my
God
,
a
livery
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
reference
to
the
coat
of
no
cut
and
no
time
,
the
unfortunate
gentleman
gasped
forth
,
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
,
and
with
his
clenched
pocket
-
handkerchief
raised
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
His
excited
feelings
might
have
found
some
further
painful
utterance
,
but
for
a
knock
at
the
door
,
which
had
been
already
twice
repeated
,
and
to
which
Fanny
(
still
wishing
herself
dead
,
and
indeed
now
going
so
far
as
to
add
,
buried
)
cried
"
Come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Young
John
!
"
said
the
Father
,
in
an
altered
and
calmed
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
is
it
,
Young
John
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
letter
for
you
,
sir
,
being
left
in
the
Lodge
just
this
minute
,
and
a
message
with
it
<EOS>
,
I
thought
,
happening
to
be
there
myself
,
sir
,
I
would
bring
it
to
your
room
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
speaker
's
attention
was
much
distracted
by
the
piteous
spectacle
of
Little
Dorrit
at
her
father
's
feet
,
with
her
head
turned
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
John

<EOS>
Thank
you

The
letter
is
from
Mr
Clennam

sir

---
it
's
the
answer

and
the
message
was
,
sir

that
Mr
Clennam
also
sent
his
compliments
,
and
word
that
he
would
do
himself
the
pleasure

calling
this
afternoon

attention
more
distracted

Miss

<EOS>
"
Oh
!

<EOS>
As
the
Father
glanced
into
the
letter
(
there
was
a
bank
-
note
in
it
)
,
he
reddened
a
little
,
and
patted
Amy
on
the
head
afresh
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you

Young
John

No

pretty
well

you

And
Mr
Chivery
junior
went
his
way
,
having
spontaneously
composed
on
the
spot
an
entirely
new
epitaph
for
himself
,
to
the
effect
that
Here
lay
the
body
of
John
Chivery
,
<EOS>
Who
,
Having
at
such
a
date
,
Beheld
the
idol
of
his
life
,
In
grief
and
tears
,
And
feeling
unable
to
bear
the
harrowing
spectacle
,
Immediately
repaired
to
the
abode
of
his
inconsolable
parents
,
And
terminated
his
existence
by
his
own
rash
act
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
Amy
!
"
said
the
Father
,
when
Young
John
had
closed
the
door
,
"
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
last
few
minutes
had
improved
his
spirits
remarkably
,
and
he
was
quite
lightsome
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
my
old
pensioner
all
this
while
?
 
<EOS>
We
must
not
leave
him
by
himself
any
longer
,
or
he
will
begin
to
suppose
he
is
not
welcome
,
and
that
would
pain
me
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
fetch
him
,
my
child
,
or
shall
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
n't
mind

said
Little
Dorrit
,
trying
to
bring
her
sobbing
to
a
close
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
will
go
,
my

.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
uneasy
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
myself
again
,
my
love
,
quite
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
your
room
,
Amy
,
and
make
yourself
look
comfortable
and
pleasant
to
receive
Mr
Clennam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
stay
in
my
own
room
,
Father
,
"
returned
Little
Dorrit
,
finding
it
more
difficult
than
before
to
regain
her
composure
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
far
rather
not
see
Mr
Clennam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
fie
,
fie
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
's
folly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
is
a
very
gentlemanly
man
---
very
gentlemanly
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
reserved
at
times
;
but
I
will
say
extremely
gentlemanly
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
think
of
your
not
being
here
to
receive
Mr
Clennam
,
my
dear
,
especially
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
So
go
and
freshen
yourself
up
,
<EOS>
Amy
;
go
and
freshen
yourself
up
,
like
a
good
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
directed
,
Little
Dorrit
dutifully
rose
and
obeyed
:
only
pausing
for
a
moment
as
she
went
out
of
the
room
,
to
give
her
sister
a
kiss
of
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
that
young
lady
,
feeling
much
harassed
in
her
mind
,
and
having
for
the
time
worn
out
the
wish
with
which
she
generally
relieved
it
,
conceived
and
executed
the
brilliant
idea
of
wishing
Old
Nandy
dead
,
rather
than
that
he
should
come
bothering
there
like
a
disgusting
,
tiresome
,
wicked
wretch
,
and
making
mischief
between
two
sisters
.
   
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
even
humming
a
tune
,
and
wearing
his
black
velvet
cap
a
little
on
one
side
,
<EOS>
so
much
improved
were
his
spirits
,
went
down
into
the
yard
,
and
found
his
old
pensioner
standing
there
hat
in
hand
just
within
the
gate
,
as
he
had
stood
all
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Nandy
!
"
said
he
,
with
great
suavity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
up
-
stairs
,
Nandy
;
you
know
the
way
;
why
do
n't
you
come
up
-
stairs
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
went
the
length
,
on
this
occasion
,
of
giving
him
his
hand
and
saying
,
"
How
are
you
,
Nandy
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
pretty
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
that
vocalist
returned
,
"
I
thank
you
,
honoured
sir
<EOS>
,
I
am
all
the
better
for
seeing
your
honour
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
they
went
along
the
yard
,
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
presented
him
to
a
Collegian
of
recent
date
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
old
acquaintance
of
mine
,
sir
,
an
old
pensioner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
said
,
"
Be
covered
,
my
good
Nandy
;
put
your
hat
on
,
"
with
great
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
His
patronage
did
not
stop
here
;
for
he
charged
Maggy
to
get
the
tea
ready
,
and
instructed
her
to
buy
certain
tea
-
cakes
,
fresh
butter
,
eggs
,
cold
ham
,
and
shrimps
:
to
purchase
which
collation
<EOS>
he
gave
her
a
bank
-
note
for
ten
pounds
,
laying
strict
injunctions
on
her
to
be
careful
of
the
change
.
 
<EOS>
These
preparations
were
in
an
advanced
stage
of
progress
,
and
his
daughter
Amy
had
come
back
with
her
work
,
when
Clennam
presented
himself
;
whom
he
most
graciously
received
,
and
besought
to
join
their
meal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
my
love
,
you
know
Mr
Clennam
even
better
than
I
have
the
happiness
of
doing
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
,
my
dear
,
you
are
acquainted
with
Mr
Clennam
.
"
 
<EOS>
Fanny
acknowledged
him
haughtily
;
the
position
she
tacitly
took
up
in
all
such
cases
being
that
there
was
a
vast
conspiracy
to
insult
the
family
by
not
understanding
it
,
or
sufficiently
deferring
to
it
,
and
here
was
one
of
the
conspirators
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
Mr
Clennam
,
you
must
know
,
is
an
old
pensioner
of
mine
,
Old
Nandy
,
a
very
faithful
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
He
always
spoke
of
him
as
an
object
of
great
antiquity
,
but
he
was
two
or
three
years
younger
than
himself
.
)
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
Plornish
,
I
think
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
daughter
Amy
has
mentioned
to
me
that
you
know
poor
Plornish
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
yes
!
"
said
Arthur
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
this
is
Mrs
Plornish
's
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
more
glad
if
you
knew
his
many
good
qualities
,
Mr
Clennam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
come
to
know
them
through
knowing
him
,
"
said
Arthur
,
secretly
pitying
the
bowed
and
submissive
figure
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
holiday
with
him
,
and
he
comes
to
see
his
old
friends
,
who
are
always
glad
to
see
him
,
"
observed
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
Then
he
added
behind
his
hand
,
(
"
Union
,
poor
old
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Out
for
the
day
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
Maggy
,
quietly
assisted
by
her
Little
Mother
,
had
spread
the
board
,
and
the
repast
was
ready
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
hot
weather
and
the
prison
very
close
,
the
window
was
as
wide
open
as
it
could
be
pushed
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
Maggy
will
spread
that
newspaper
on
the
window
-
sill
,
my
dear
,
"
remarked
the
Father
complacently
and
in
a
half
whisper
to
Little
Dorrit
,
"
my
old
pensioner
can
have
his
tea
there
,
while
we
are
having
ours
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
with
a
gulf
between
him
and
the
good
company
of
about
a
foot
in
width
,
standard
measure
,
Mrs
Plornish
's
father
was
handsomely
regaled
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
had
never
seen
anything
like
his
magnanimous
protection
by
that
other
Father
,
he
of
the
Marshalsea
;
and
was
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
its
many
wonders
.
   
<EOS>
The
most
striking
of
these
was
perhaps
the
relishing
manner
in
which
he
remarked
on
the
pensioner
's
infirmities
and
failings
,
as
if
he
were
a
gracious
Keeper
making
a
running
commentary
on
the
decline
of
the
harmless
animal
he
exhibited
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
ready
for
more
ham
yet
,
Nandy
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
how
slow
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
(
His
last
teeth
,
"
he
explained
to
the
company
,
"
are
going
,
poor
old
boy
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
At
another
time
,
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
No
shrimps
,
Nandy
?
"
and
on
his
not
instantly
replying
,
observed
,
(
"
His
hearing
is
becoming
very
defective
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
be
deaf
directly
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
At
another
time
he
asked
him
,
"
Do
you
walk
much
,
Nandy
,
about
the
yard
within
the
walls
of
that
place
of
yours
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
;
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
any
great
liking
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
to
be
sure
,
"
he
assented
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
natural
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
privately
informed
the
circle
(
"
Legs
going
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
Once
he
asked
the
pensioner
,
in
that
general
clemency
which
asked
him
anything
to
keep
him
afloat
,
how
old
his
younger
grandchild
was
?
   
<EOS>
"
John
Edward
,
"
said
the
pensioner
,
slowly
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
to
consider
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
old
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
think
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
tapped
his
forehead
(
"
Memory
weak
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
"
John
Edward
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
really
forget
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
say
at
this
minute
,
sir
,
whether
it
's
two
and
two
months
,
or
whether
it
's
two
and
five
months
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
distress
yourself
by
worrying
your
mind
about
it
,
"
he
returned
,
with
infinite
forbearance
.
 
<EOS>
(
"
Faculties
evidently
decaying
---
old
man
rusts
in
the
life
he
leads
!
"
)
   
<EOS>
The
more
of
these
discoveries
that
he
persuaded
himself
he
made
in
the
pensioner
<EOS>
,
the
better
he
appeared
to
like
him
;
and
when
he
got
out
of
his
chair
after
tea
to
bid
the
pensioner
good
-
bye
,
on
his
intimating
that
he
feared
,
honoured
sir
,
his
time
was
running
out
,
he
made
himself
look
as
erect
and
strong
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
call
this
a
shilling
,
Nandy
,
you
know
,
"
he
said
,
putting
one
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
call
it
tobacco
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Honoured
sir
,
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
shall
buy
tobacco
.
 
<EOS>
My
thanks
and
duty
to
Miss
Amy
and
Miss
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
night
,
Mr
Clennam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
mind
you
do
n't
forget
us
,
you
know
,
Nandy
,
"
said
the
Father
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
come
again
,
mind
,
whenever
you
have
an
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
come
out
without
seeing
us
,
or
we
shall
be
jealous
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Nandy
.
 
<EOS>
Be
very
careful
how
you
descend
the
stairs
,
Nandy
;
they
are
rather
uneven
and
worn
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
stood
on
the
landing
,
watching
the
old
man
down
:
and
when
he
came
into
the
room
again
,
said
,
with
a
solemn
satisfaction
on
him
,
"
<EOS>
A
melancholy
sight
<EOS>
that
,
Mr
Clennam
,
though
one
has
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
he
does
n't
feel
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
old
fellow
is
a
dismal
wreck
.
<EOS>
Spirit
broken
and
gone
---
pulverised
---
crushed
out
of
him
,
sir
,
completely
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
Clennam
had
a
purpose
in
remaining
,
he
said
what
he
could
responsive
to
these
sentiments
,
and
stood
at
the
window
with
their
enunciator
,
while
Maggy
and
her
Little
Mother
washed
the
tea
-
service
and
cleared
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
noticed
that
his
companion
stood
at
the
window
with
the
air
of
an
affable
and
accessible
Sovereign
,
and
that
,
when
any
of
his
people
in
the
yard
below
looked
up
,
his
recognition
of
their
salutes
just
stopped
short
of
a
blessing
.
   
<EOS>
When
Little
Dorrit
had
her
work
on
the
table
,
and
Maggy
hers
on
the
bedstead
,
Fanny
fell
to
tying
her
bonnet
as
a
preliminary
to
her
departure
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
,
still
having
his
purpose
,
still
remained
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
door
opened
,
without
any
notice
,
and
Mr
Tip
came
in
.
<EOS>
He
kissed
Amy
as
she
started
up
to
meet
him
,
nodded
to
Fanny
,
nodded
to
his
father
,
gloomed
on
the
visitor
without
further
recognition
,
and
sat
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tip
,
dear
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
mildly
,
shocked
by
this
,
"
do
n't
you
see
---
"
   
"
Yes
,
I
see
,
<EOS>
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
refer
to
the
presence
of
any
visitor
you
have
here
---
I
say
,
if
you
refer
to
that
,
"
answered
Tip
,
jerking
his
head
with
emphasis
towards
his
shoulder
nearest
Clennam
,
"
I
see
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
you
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
,
"
added
the
lofty
young
man
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
that
visitor
will
understand
me
,
when
I
say
that
's
all
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
suppose
the
visitor
will
understand
that
he
has
n't
used
me
like
a
gentleman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
that
,
"
observed
the
obnoxious
personage
referred
to
with
tranquillity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
to
make
it
clearer
to
you
,
sir
,
I
beg
to
let
you
know
that
when
I
address
what
I
call
a
properly
-
worded
appeal
,
and
an
urgent
appeal
,
and
a
delicate
appeal
,
to
an
individual
,
for
a
small
temporary
accommodation
,
easily
within
his
power
---
easily
within
his
power
,
mind
!
<EOS>
---
and
when
that
individual
writes
back
word
to
me
that
he
begs
to
be
excused
,
I
consider
that
he
does
n't
treat
me
like
a
gentleman
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
who
had
surveyed
his
son
in
silence
,
no
sooner
heard
this
sentiment
,
than
he
began
in
angry
voice
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
---
"
But
his
son
stopped
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
ask
me
how
I
dare
,
father
,
because
that
's
bosh
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
fact
of
the
line
of
conduct
I
choose
to
adopt
towards
the
individual
present
,
you
ought
to
be
proud
of
my
showing
a
proper
spirit
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
proper
spirit
?
"
said
the
Father
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
a
proper
spirit
;
a
becoming
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
come
to
this
that
my
son
teaches
me
---
ME
---
spirit
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
let
us
bother
about
it
,
father
,
or
have
any
row
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
fully
made
up
my
mind
that
the
individual
present
has
not
treated
me
like
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
not
an
end
of
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
Father
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
there
shall
not
be
an
end
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
made
up
your
mind
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
made
up
your
mind
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
good
of
keeping
on
like
that
?

Because
,
"
returned
the
Father
,
in
a
great
heat
,
"
you
had
no
right

make
up
your

No

Mr

I
beg

sir

Do
n't
ask
me
to
desist

there

a

a

principle
involved
here

rises

I
object
to
the
assertion
made
by
my

I

I

repel
it

<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
is
it
to
you

father

returned
the
son
,
over
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
to
me
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
a

a

sir

that
will
not
endure
it

<EOS>
I
<EOS>

he
took
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
again
and
dabbed
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
outraged
and
insulted
by
it

<EOS>
Let
me
suppose
the
case
that
I
myself
may
at
a
certain
time

have
made
a

an
appeal

and
a
properly

worded
appeal
,
and
a
delicate
appeal
,
and
an
urgent
appeal
to
some
individual
for
a
small
temporary
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
suppose
that
that
accommodation
could
have
been
easily
extended
,
and
was
not
extended
,
and
that
that
individual
informed
me
that
he
begged

be
excused

<EOS>
Am
I
to

told
by

that
I

received
treatment

I
submitted
to
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
daughter
Amy
gently
tried
to
calm
him
,
but
he
would
not
on
any
account
be
calmed
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
his
spirit
was
up
,
and
would
n't
endure
this
.
   
<EOS>
Was
he
to
be
told
that
,
he
wished
to
know
again
,
by
his
own
son
on
his
own
hearth
,
to
his
own
face
?
 
<EOS>
Was
that
humiliation
to
be
put
upon
him
by
his
own
blood
?
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
putting
it
on
yourself
,
father
,
and
getting
into
all
this
injury
of
your
own
accord

"
said
the
young
gentleman
morosely
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
made
up
my
mind
about
has
nothing
to
do

<EOS>
What
I
said
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Why
need
you
go
trying
on
other

hats
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
reply
it
has
everything
to
do
with
me
,
"
returned
the
Father
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
point
out
to
you
,
sir
,
with
indignation
,
that
---
hum

<EOS>
the

delicacy
and
peculiarity
of
your

position
should
strike
you
dumb

if
nothing

should
,
in
laying
down
such

such
unnatural
principles

<EOS>
Besides
;

you

not

Are
you

an
Atheist

<EOS>
And
is
it
Christian
<EOS>
,
let
me
ask
you
,
to
stigmatise
and
denounce
an
individual
for
begging
to
be
excused
this
time
,
when
the

individual
may

respond
with
the
required
accommodation
next

<EOS>
Is
it
the
part
of
a
Christian
not
to
---
hum
---
not
to
try
him
again
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
had
worked
himself
into
quite
a
religious
glow
and
fervour
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
precious
well
,
"
said
Mr
Tip
,
rising
,
"
that
I
shall
get
no
sensible
or
fair
argument
here
to

night
,
and
<EOS>
so
the
best
thing
I
can
do
is
to
cut
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
vexed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
it
happens
here
,
and
you
here
,
upon
my
soul
I
am
;
but
I
ca
n't
altogether
part
with
my
spirit
,
even
for
your
sake
,
old
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
,
accompanied
by
Miss
Fanny
;
who
did
not
consider
it
spirited
on
her
part
to
take
leave
of
Clennam
with
any
less
opposing
demonstration
than
a
stare
,
importing
that
she
had
always
known
him
for
one
of
the
large
body
of
conspirators
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
were
gone
,
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
was
at
first
inclined
to
sink
into
despondency
again
,
and
would
have
done
so
,
but
that
a
gentleman
opportunely
came
up
within
a
minute
or
two
to
attend
him
to
the
Snuggery
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
gentleman
Clennam
had
seen
on
the
night
of
his
own
accidental
detention
there
,
who
had
that
impalpable
grievance
about
the
misappropriated
Fund
on
which
the
Marshal
was
supposed
to
batten
.
 
<EOS>
He
presented
himself
as
deputation
to
escort
the
Father
to
the
Chair
,
it
being
an
occasion
on
which
he
had
promised
to
preside
over
the
assembled
Collegians
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
little
Harmony
.
   
<EOS>
"
Such
,
you
see
,
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
the
Father
,
"
are
the
incongruities
of
my
position
here
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
public
duty
!
 
<EOS>
No
man
,
I
am
sure
,
would
more
readily
recognise
a
public
duty
than
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
besought
him
not
to
delay
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
my
dear
,
if
you
can
persuade
Mr
Clennam
to
stay
longer
,
I
can
leave
the
honours
of
our
poor
apology
for
an
establishment
with
confidence
in
your
hands
,
and
perhaps
you
may
do
something
towards
erasing
from
Mr
Clennam
's
mind
<EOS>
the
---
ha
---
untoward
and
unpleasant
circumstance
which
has
occurred
since
tea
-
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
assured
him
that
it
had
made
no
impression
on
his
mind
,
and
therefore
required
no
erasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
"
said
the
Father
,
with
a
removal
of
his
black
cap
and
a
grasp
of
Clennam
's
hand
,
combining
to
express
the
safe
receipt
of
his
note
and
enclosure
that
afternoon
,
"
Heaven
ever
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
at
last
,
Clennam
's
purpose
in
remaining
was
attained
,
and
he
could
speak
to
Little
Dorrit
with
nobody
by
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
counted
as
nobody
,
and
she
was
by
.
    
Chapter
32
.
<EOS>
More
Fortune
-
Telling
 
Maggy
sat
at
her
work
in
her
great
white
cap
with
its
quantity
of
opaque
frilling
hiding
what
profile
she
had
<EOS>
(
she
had
none
to
spare
)
,
and
her
serviceable
eye
brought
to
bear
upon
her
occupation
,
on
the
window
side
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
What
with
her
flapping
cap
,
and
what
with
her
unserviceable
eye
,
she
was
quite
partitioned
off
from
her
Little
Mother
,
whose
seat
was
opposite
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
tread
and
shuffle
of
feet
on
the
pavement
of
the
yard
had
much
diminished
since
the
taking
of
the
Chair
,
the
tide
of
Collegians
having
set
strongly
in
the
direction
of
Harmony
.
 
<EOS>
Some
few
who
had
no
music
in
their
souls
,
or
no
money
in
their
pockets
,
dawdled
about
;
and
the
old
spectacle
of
the
visitor
-
wife
and
the
depressed
unseasoned
prisoner
still
lingered
in
corners
,
as
broken
cobwebs
and
such
unsightly
discomforts
draggle
in
corners
of
other
places
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
quietest
time
the
College
knew
,
saving
the
night
hours
when
the
Collegians
took
the
benefit
of
the
act
of
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
occasional
rattle
of
applause
upon
the
tables
of
the
Snuggery
,
denoted
the
successful
termination
of
a
morsel
of
Harmony
;
or
the
responsive
acceptance
,
by
the
united
children
,
of
some
toast
or
sentiment
offered
to
them
by
their
Father
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
a
vocal
strain
more
sonorous
than
the
generality
informed
the
listener
that
some
boastful
bass
was
in
blue
water
,
or
in
the
hunting
field
,
or
with
the
reindeer
,
or
on
the
mountain
,
or
among
the
heather
;
but
the
Marshal
of
the
Marshalsea
knew
better
,
and
had
got
him
hard
and
fast
.
   
<EOS>
As
Arthur
Clennam
moved
to
sit
down
by
the
side
of
Little
Dorrit
,
she
trembled
so
that
she
had
much
ado
to
hold
her
needle
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
gently
put
his
hand
upon
her
work
,
and
said
,
"
Dear
Little
Dorrit
,
let
me
lay
it
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
yielded
it
to
him
,
and
he
put
it
aside
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hands
were
then
nervously
clasping
together
,
but
he
took
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
seldom
I
have
seen
you
lately
,
Little
Dorrit
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
busy
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
heard
only
to
-
day
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
by
mere
accident
,
of
your
having
been
with
those
good
people
close
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
not
come
to
me
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Or
rather
,
I
thought
you
might
be
busy
too
.
 
<EOS>
You
generally
are
now
,
are
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
saw
her
trembling
little
form
and
her
downcast
face
,
and
the
eyes
that
drooped
the
moment
they
were
raised
to
his
---
he
saw
them
almost
with
as
much
concern
as
tenderness
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
child
,
your
manner
is
so
changed
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
trembling
was
now
quite
beyond
her
control
.
 
<EOS>
Softly
withdrawing
her
hand
,
and
laying
it
in
her
other
hand
,
she
sat
before
him
with
her
head
bent
and
her
whole
form
trembling
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
own
Little
Dorrit
,
"
said
Clennam
,
compassionately
.
   
<EOS>
She
burst
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
looked
round
of
a
sudden
,
and
stared
for
at
least
a
minute
;
but
did
not
interpose
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
waited
some
little
while
before
he
spoke
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
,
"
he
said
then
,
"
to
see
you
weep
;
but
I
hope
this
is
a
relief
to
an
overcharged
heart
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
it
is
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
but
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
feared
you
would
think
too
much
of
what
passed
here
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
of
no
moment
;
not
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
only
unfortunate
to
have
come
in
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
go
by
with
these
tears
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
worth
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
Such
an
idle
thing
should
be
repeated
,
with
my
glad
consent
,
fifty
times
a
day
,
to
save
you
a
moment
's
heart
-
ache
,
Little
Dorrit
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
taken
courage
now
,
and
answered
,
far
more
in
her
usual
manner
,
"
You
are
so
good
!
 
<EOS>
But
even
if
there
was
nothing
else
in
it
to
be
sorry
for
and
ashamed
of
<EOS>
,
it
is
such
a
bad
return
to
you
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Hush
!
"
said
Clennam
,
smiling
and
touching
her
lips
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Forgetfulness
in
you
who
remember
so
many
and
so
much
,
would
be
new
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
remind
you
that
I
am
not
,
and
that
I
never
was
,
anything
but
the
friend
whom
you
agreed
to
trust
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
it
,
do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
try
to
do
so
,
or
I
should
have
broken
the
promise
just
now
,
when
my
mistaken
brother
was
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
consider
his
bringing
-
up
in
this
place
,
and
will
not
judge
him
hardly
,
poor
fellow
,
I
know
!
"
<EOS>
In
raising
her
eyes
with
these
words
,
she
observed
his
face
more
nearly
than
she
had
done
yet
,
and
said
,
with
a
quick
change
of
tone
,
"
You
have
not
been
ill
,
Mr
Clennam
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
tried
?
 
<EOS>
Nor
hurt
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
him
,
anxiously
.
   
<EOS>
It
fell
to
Clennam
now
,
to
be
not
quite
certain
how
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
in
reply
:
   
"
<EOS>
To
speak
the
truth
,
I
have
been
a
little
troubled
,
but
it
is
over
.
   
<EOS>
Do
I
show
it
so
plainly
?
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
more
fortitude
and
self
-
command
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
learn
them
of
you
.
<EOS>
Who
could
teach
me
better
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
never
thought
that
she
saw
in
him
what
no
one
else
could
see
.
<EOS>
He
never
thought
that
in
the
whole
world
there
were
no
other
eyes
that
looked
upon
him
with
the
same
light
and
strength
as
hers
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
brings
me
to
something
that
I
wish
to
say
,
"
he
continued
,
"
and
therefore
I
will
not
quarrel
even
with
my
own
face
for
telling
tales
and
being
unfaithful
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
is
a
privilege
and
pleasure
to
confide
in
my
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
confess
then
,
that
,
forgetting
how
grave
I
was
,
and
how
old
I
was
,
and
how
the
time
for
such
things
had
gone
by
me
with
the
many
years
of
sameness
and
little
happiness
that
made
up
my
long
life
far
away
,
without
marking
it
---
that
,
forgetting
all
this
,
I
fancied
I
loved
some
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
know
her
,
sir
?
"
asked
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
lady
who
has
been
kind
to
me
for
your
sake
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Flora
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
---
"
   
"
I
never
quite
thought
so
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
more
to
herself
than
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
wonder
at
it
a
little
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Clennam
,
abiding
by
the
feeling
that
had
fallen
on
him
in
the
avenue
on
the
night
of
the
roses
,
the
feeling
that
he
was
an
older
man
,
who
had
done
with
that
tender
part
of
life
,
"
I
found
out
my
mistake
,
and
I
thought
about
it
a
little
---
in
short
,
a
good
deal
---
and
got
wiser
.
 
<EOS>
Being
wiser
,
I
counted
up
my
years
and
considered
what
I
am
,
and
looked
back
,
and
looked
forward
,
and
found
that
I
should
soon
be
grey
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
that
I
had
climbed
the
hill
,
and
passed
the
level
ground
upon
the
top
,
and
was
descending
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
If
he
had
known
the
sharpness
of
the
pain
he
caused
the
patient
heart
,
in
speaking
thus
!
 
<EOS>
While
doing
it
,
too
,
with
the
purpose
of
easing
and
serving
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
found
that
the
day
when
any
such
thing
would
have
been
graceful
in
me
,
or
good
in
me
,
or
hopeful
or
happy
for
me
or
any
one
in
connection
with
me
,
was
gone
,
and
would
never
shine
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
O
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
known
,
if
he
had
known
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
seen
the
dagger
in
his
hand
,
and
the
cruel
wounds
it
struck
in
the
faithful
bleeding
breast
of
his
Little
Dorrit
!
   
<EOS>
"
All
that
is
over
,
and
I
have
turned
my
face
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
I
speak
of
this
to
Little
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
I
show
you
,
my
child
,
the
space
of
years
that
there
is
between
us
,
and
recall
to
you
that
I
have
passed
,
by
the
amount
of
your
whole
life
,
the
time
that
is
present
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
you
trust
me
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Because
you
know
that
nothing
can
touch
you
without
touching
me
;
that
nothing
can
make
you
happy
or
unhappy
,
but
it
must
make
me
,
who
am
so
grateful
to
you
,
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
heard
the
thrill
in
her
voice
,
he
saw
her
earnest
face
,
he
saw
her
clear
true
eyes
,
he
saw
the
quickened
bosom
that
would
have
joyfully
thrown
itself
before
him
to
receive
a
mortal
wound
directed
at
his
breast
,
with
the
dying
cry
,
"
I
love
him
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
remotest
suspicion
of
the
truth
never
dawned
upon
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
devoted
little
creature
with
her
worn
shoes
,
in
her
common
dress
,
in
her
jail
-
home
;
a
slender
child
in
body
,
a
strong
heroine
in
soul
;
and
the
light
of
her
domestic
story
made
all
else
dark
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
those
reasons
assuredly
,
Little
Dorrit
,
but
for
another
too
.
<EOS>
So
far
removed
,
so
different
,
and
so
much
older
,
I
am
the
better
fitted
for
your
friend
and
adviser
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
I
am
the
more
easily
to
be
trusted
;
and
any
little
constraint
that
you
might
feel
with
another
,
may
vanish
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
have
you
kept
so
retired
from
me
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
better
here
.
 
<EOS>
My
place
and
use
are
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
much
better
here
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
said
that
day
upon
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
it
much
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
<EOS>
no
secret
you
could
entrust
to
me
,
with
hope
and
comfort
,
if
you
would
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Secret
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
no
secret
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
in
some
trouble
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
been
speaking
in
low
voices
;
more
because
it
was
natural
to
what
they
said
to
adopt
that
tone
,
than
with
any
care
to
reserve
it
from
Maggy
at
her
work
.
 
<EOS>
All
of
a
sudden
Maggy
stared
again
,
and
this
time
spoke
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
Little
Mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Maggy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
an't
got
no
secret
of
your
own
to
tell
him
,
tell
him
that
about
the
Princess
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
secret
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Princess
had
a
secret
?
"
said
Clennam
,
in
some
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
Princess
was
that
,
Maggy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
 
<EOS>
How
you
do
go
and
bother
a
gal
of
ten
,
"
said
Maggy
,
"
catching
the
poor
thing
up
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
Whoever
said
the
Princess
had
a
secret
?
 
<EOS>
\I\
never
said
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
,
when
it
was
her
as
wanted
to
find
it
out
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
little
woman
as
had
the
secret
,
and
she
was
always
a
spinning
at
her
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
she
says
to
her
,
why
do
you
keep
it
there
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
the
t'other
one
says
to
her
,
<EOS>
no
I
do
n't
;
and
<EOS>
so
the
t'other
one
says
to
her
,
yes
you
do
;
and
then
they
both
goes
to
the
cupboard
,
and
there
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
would
n't
go
into
the
Hospital
,
and
<EOS>
so
she
died
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
Little
Mother
;
tell
him
that
.
   
<EOS>
For
it
was
a
reg'lar
good
secret
,
that
was
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Maggy
,
hugging
herself
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
looked
at
Little
Dorrit
for
help
to
comprehend
this
,
and
was
struck
by
seeing
her
so
timid
and
red
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
she
told
him
that
it
was
only
a
Fairy
Tale
<EOS>
she
had
one
day
made
up
for
Maggy
,
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
which
she
would
n't
be
ashamed
to
tell
again
to
anybody
else
,
even
if
she
could
remember
it
,
he
left
the
subject
where
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
he
returned
to
his
own
subject
by
first
entreating
her
to
see
him
oftener
,
and
to
remember
that
it
was
impossible
to
have
a
stronger
interest
in
her
welfare
than
he
had
,
or
to
be
more
set
upon
promoting
it
than
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
answered
fervently
,
she
well
knew
that
,
she
never
forgot
it
<EOS>
,
he
touched
upon
his
second
and
more
delicate
point
---
the
suspicion
he
had
formed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Little
Dorrit
,
"
he
said
,
taking
her
hand
again
,
and
speaking
lower
than
he
had
spoken
yet
,
so
that
even
Maggy
in
the
small
room
could
not
hear
him
,
"
another
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
wanted
very
much
to
say
this
to
you
;
I
have
tried
for
opportunities
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
me
,
who
,
for
the
matter
of
years
,
might
be
your
father
or
your
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
Always
think
of
me
as
quite
an
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
all
your
devotion
centres
in
this
room
,
and
that
nothing
to
the
last
will
ever
tempt
you
away
from
the
duties
you
discharge
here
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
were
not
sure
of
it
,
I
should
,
before
now
,
have
implored
you
,
and
implored
your
father
,
to
let
me
make
some
provision
for
you
in
a
more
suitable
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
may
have
an
interest
---
I
will
not
say
,
now
,
though
even
that
might
be
---
may
have
,
at
another
time
,
an
interest
in
some
one
else
;
an
interest
not
incompatible
with
your
affection
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
very
,
very
pale
,
and
silently
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
dear
Little
Dorrit
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
after
each
slow
repetition
of
the
word
,
with
an
air
of
quiet
desolation
that
he
remembered
long
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
came
when
he
remembered
it
well
,
long
afterwards
,
within
those
prison
walls
;
within
that
very
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
if
it
ever
should
be
,
tell
me
so
,
my
dear
child
.
 
<EOS>
Entrust
the
truth
to
me
,
point
out
the
object
of
such
an
interest
to
me
,
and
I
will
try
with
all
the
zeal
,
and
honour
,
and
friendship
and
respect
that
I
feel
for
you
,
good
Little
Dorrit
of
my
heart
,
to
do
you
a
lasting
service
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
thank
you
,
thank
you
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
O
no
,
O
no
,
O
no
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
said
this
,
looking
at
him
with
her
work
-
worn
hands
folded
together
,
and
in
the
same
resigned
accents
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
press
for
no
confidence
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
to
repose
unhesitating
trust
in
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
do
less
than
that
,
when
you
are
so
good
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
trust
me
fully
?
 
<EOS>
Will
have
no
secret
unhappiness
,
or
anxiety
,
concealed
from
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Almost
none
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
have
none
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
very
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
lie
down
to
-
night
,
and
my
thoughts
come
back
---
as
they
will
,
for
they
do
every
night
,
even
when
I
have
not
seen
you
---
to
this
sad
place
,
I
may
believe
that
there
is
no
grief
beyond
this
room
,
now
,
and
its
usual
occupants
,
which
preys
on
Little
Dorrit
's
mind
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
catch
at
these
words
---
that
he
remembered
,
too
,
long
afterwards
---
and
said
,
more
brightly
,
"
Yes
,
Mr
Clennam
;
yes
,
you
may
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
crazy
staircase
,
usually
not
slow
to
give
notice
when
any
one
was
coming
up
or
down
,
here
creaked
under
a
quick
tread
,
and
a
further
sound
was
heard
upon
it
,
as
if
a
little
steam
-
engine
with
more
steam
than
it
knew
what
to
do
with
,
were
working
towards
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
approached
,
which
it
did
very
rapidly
,
it
laboured
with
increased
energy
;
and
,
after
knocking
at
the
door
,
it
sounded
as
if
it
were
stooping
down
and
snorting
in
at
the
keyhole
.
   
<EOS>
Before
Maggy
could
open
the
door
,
Mr
Pancks
,
opening
it
from
without
,
stood
without
a
hat
and
with
his
bare
head
in
the
wildest
condition
,
looking
at
Clennam
and
Little
Dorrit
,
over
her
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
a
lighted
cigar
in
his
hand
,
and
brought
with
him
airs
of
ale
and
tobacco
smoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pancks
the
gipsy
,
"
he
observed
out
of
breath
,
<EOS>
"
fortune
-
telling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
stood
dingily
smiling
,
and
breathing
hard
at
them
,
with
a
most
curious
air
;
as
if
,
instead
of
being
his
proprietor
's
grubber
,
he
were
the
triumphant
proprietor
of
the
Marshalsea
,
the
Marshal
,
all
the
turnkeys
,
and
all
the
Collegians
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
great
self
-
satisfaction
he
put
his
cigar
to
his
lips
(
being
evidently
no
smoker
)
,
and
took
such
a
pull
at
it
,
with
his
right
eye
shut
up
tight
for
the
purpose
,
that
he
underwent
a
convulsion
of
shuddering
and
choking
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
in
the
midst
of
that
paroxysm
,
he
still
essayed
to
repeat
his
favourite
introduction
of
himself
,
"
Pa
-
ancks
the
gi
-
ipsy
,
fortune
-
telling
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
spending
the
evening
with
the
rest
of
'
em
,
"
said
Pancks
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
singing
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
taking
a
part
in
White
sand
and
grey
sand
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
any
part
in
anything
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
the
same
,
if
you
're
loud
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
first
Clennam
supposed
him
to
be
intoxicated
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
soon
perceived
that
though
he
might
be
a
little
the
worse
(
or
better
)
for
ale
,
the
staple
of
his
excitement
was
not
brewed
from
malt
,
or
distilled
from
any
grain
or
berry
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
,
Miss
Dorrit
?
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
n't
mind
my
running
round
,
and
looking
in
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
I
heard
was
here
,
from
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
you
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
thanked
him
,
and
said
he
was
glad
to
see
him
<EOS>
so
gay
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gay
!
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
in
wonderful
feather
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stop
a
minute
,
or
I
shall
be
missed
,
and
I
do
n't
want
'em
to
miss
me
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Eh
,
Miss
Dorrit
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
have
an
insatiate
delight
in
appealing
to
her
and
looking
at
her
;
excitedly
sticking
his
hair
up
at
the
same
moment
,
like
a
dark
species
of
cockatoo
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
been
here
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
Mr
Dorrit
was
in
the
chair
,
and
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
I
'll
go
and
support
him
!
"
<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
down
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
by
rights
;
but
I
can
worry
them
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Eh
,
Miss
Dorrit
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
little
black
eyes
sparkled
electrically
.
 
<EOS>
His
very
hair
seemed
to
sparkle
as
he
roughened
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
that
highly
-
charged
state
that
one
might
have
expected
to
draw
sparks
and
snaps
from
him
by
presenting
a
knuckle
to

"
Eh

"
   
<EOS>
She
was
half
afraid
of
him
,
and
irresolute
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
laughed
,
with
a
nod
towards
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
him
,
Miss
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
one
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
agreed
that
you
should
n't
take
on
to
mind
me
before
people
,
but
we
did
n't
mean
Mr
Clennam

He
's

<EOS>
Eh

"
The
excitement
of
this
strange
creature
was
fast
communicating
itself
to
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
with
amazement
,
saw
this
,
and
observed
that
they
exchanged
quick
looks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
making
a
remark

"
said
Pancks
,
"

I
declare
I

Oh

Very

she
returned
,
noticing
another
of
the
quick
looks
between
the
two
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not

said
Pancks

<EOS>
Eh
,
Miss

"
   
<EOS>
She
was
thrown
into
such
a
confusion
by
his
manner
,
or
rather
by
Clennam
's
growing
understanding
of
his
manner
(
for
she
looked
to
him
after
every
fresh
appeal
and
cockatoo
demonstration
on
the
part
of
Mr
Pancks
)
,
that
she
only
moved
her
lips
in
answer
,
without
forming
any
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
oh
,
by

"
said
Pancks
,
"

---
<EOS>
Eh

Miss

"
   
<EOS>
He
had
suddenly
checked
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Where
he
got
all
the
additional
black
prongs
from
,
that
now
flew
up
all
over
his
head
like
the
myriads
of
points
that
break
out
in
the
large
change
of
a
great
firework
,
was
a
wonderful
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
be
missed
;
"
he
came
back
to
that
;
"
and
I
do
n't
want
'em
to
miss
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
you
and
I
made
a
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
you
should
find
me
stick
to
it

<EOS>
You
shall
find
me
stick
to

now

if
you
'll
step
out

a

Miss

I

<EOS>
Miss

I
wish

good

"
   
<EOS>
He
rapidly
shook
her
by
both
hands
,
and
puffed
down
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
followed
him
with
such
a
hurried
step
,
that
he
had
very
nearly
tumbled
over
him
on
the
last
landing
,
and
rolled
him
down
into
the
yard
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
"
<EOS>
Arthur
demanded
,
when
they
burst
out
there
both
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
moment
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
introduce
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
those
words
he
presented
another
man
without
a
hat
,
and
also
with
a
cigar
,
and
also
surrounded
with
a
halo
of
ale
and
tobacco
smoke
,
which
man
,
though
not
so
excited
as
himself
,
was
in
a
state
which
would
have
been
akin
to
lunacy
<EOS>
but
for
its
fading
into
sober
method
when
compared
with
the
rampancy
of
Mr
Pancks
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
Mr
Rugg
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Come
to
the
pump
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
adjourned
to
the
pump
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
instantly
putting
his
head
under
the
spout
,
requested
Mr
Rugg
to
take
a
good
strong
turn
at
the
handle
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
complying
to
the
letter
,
Mr
Pancks
came
forth
snorting
and
blowing
to
some
purpose
,
and
dried
himself
on
his
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
clearer
for
that
,
"
he
gasped
to
Clennam
standing
astonished
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
upon
my
soul
,
to
hear
her
father
making
speeches
in
that
chair
,
knowing
what
we
know
,
and
to
see
her
up
in
that
room
in
that
dress
,
knowing
what
we
know
,
is
enough
to
---
give
me
a
back
,
Mr
Rugg
---
a
little
higher
,
sir
,
---
that
'll
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
Then
and
there
,
on
that
Marshalsea
pavement
,
in
the
shades
of
evening
,
did
Mr
Pancks
,
of
all
mankind
,
fly
over
the
head
and
shoulders
of
Mr
Rugg
of
Pentonville
,
General
Agent
,
Accountant
,
and
Recoverer
of
Debts
.
 
<EOS>
Alighting
on
his
feet
,
he
took
Clennam
by
the
button
-
hole
,
led
him
behind
the
pump
,
and
pantingly
produced
from
his
pocket
a
bundle
of
papers
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
,
also
,
pantingly
produced
from
his
pocket
a
bundle
of
papers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
said
Clennam
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
a
discovery
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
answered
,
with
an
unction
which
there
is
no
language
to
convey
,
"
We
rather
think
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
it
implicate
any
one

"
   
<EOS>
"
How
implicate

<EOS>
"
In

"
   
"
Not
a

of
it
.
"
   
"
Thank
God

"
said
Clennam
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
show
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
understand
"
---
snorted
Pancks
,
feverishly
unfolding
papers
,
and
speaking
in
short
high
-
pressure
blasts
of
sentences
,
<EOS>
"

Never

Mrs
Merdle
's
Complaint
 
Resigning
herself
to
inevitable
fate
by
making
the
best
of
those
people
,
the
Miggleses
,
and
submitting
her
philosophy
to
the
draught
upon
it
,
of
which
she
had
foreseen
the
likelihood
in
her
interview
with
Arthur
,
Mrs
Gowan
handsomely
resolved
not
to
oppose
her
son
's
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
progress
to
,
and
happy
arrival
at
,
this
resolution
,
she
was
possibly
influenced
,
not
only
by
her
maternal
affections
but
by
three
politic
considerations
.
   
<EOS>
Of
these
,
the
first
may
have
been
that
her
son
had
never
signified
the
smallest
intention
to
ask
her
consent
,
or
any
mistrust
of
his
ability
to
dispense
with
it
;
the
second
,
that
the
pension
bestowed
upon
her
by
a
grateful
country
(
and
a
Barnacle
)
would
be
freed
from
any
little
filial
inroads
,
when
her
Henry
should
be
married
to
the
darling
<EOS>
only
child
of
a
man
in
very
easy
circumstances
;
the
third
,
that
Henry
's
debts
must
clearly
be
paid
down
upon
the
altar
-
railing
by
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
to
these
three
-
fold
points
of
prudence
there
is
added
the
fact
that
Mrs
Gowan
yielded
her
consent
the
moment
she
knew
of
Mr
Meagles
having
yielded
his
,
and
that
Mr
Meagles
's
objection
to
the
marriage
had
been
the
sole
obstacle
in
its
way
all
along
,
it
becomes
the
height
of
probability
that
the
relict
of
the
deceased
Commissioner
of
nothing
particular
,
turned
these
ideas
in
her
sagacious
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Among
her
connections
and
acquaintances
,
however
,
she
maintained
her
individual
dignity
and
the
dignity
of
the
blood
of
the
Barnacles
,
by
diligently
nursing
the
pretence
that
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
business
;
that
she
was
sadly
cut
up
by
it
;
that
this
was
a
perfect
fascination
under
which
Henry
laboured
;
that
she
had
opposed
it
for
a
long
time
,
but
what
could
a
mother
do
;
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
already
called
Arthur
Clennam
to
bear
witness
to
this
fable
,
as
a
friend
of
the
Meagles
family
;
and
she
followed
up
the
move
by
now
impounding
the
family
itself
for
the
same
purpose
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
interview
she
accorded
to
Mr
Meagles
,
she
slided
herself
into
the
position
of
disconsolately
but
gracefully
yielding
to
irresistible
pressure
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
utmost
politeness
and
good
-
breeding
,
she
feigned
that
it
was
she
---
not
he
---
who
had
made
the
difficulty
,
and
who
at
length
gave
way
;
and
that
the
sacrifice
was
hers
---
not
his
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
feint
,
with
the
same
polite
dexterity
<EOS>
,
she
foisted
on
Mrs
Meagles
,
as
a
conjuror
might
have
forced
a
card
on
that
innocent
lady
;
and
,
when
her
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
was
presented
to
her
by
her
son
,
she
said
on
embracing
her
,
"
My
dear
,
what
have
you
done
to
Henry
that
has
bewitched
him
so
!
"
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
allowing
a
few
tears
to
carry
before
them
,
in
little
pills
,
the
cosmetic
powder
on
her
nose
;
as
a
delicate
but
touching
signal
that
she
suffered
much
inwardly
for
the
show
of
composure
with
which
she
bore
her
misfortune
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
friends
of
Mrs
Gowan
(
who
piqued
herself
at
once
on
being
Society
,
and
on
maintaining
intimate
and
easy
relations
with
that
Power
)
,
Mrs
Merdle
occupied
a
front
row
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
the
Hampton
Court
Bohemians
,
without
exception
,
turned
up
their
noses
at
Merdle
as
an
upstart
;
but
they
turned
them
down
again
,
by
falling
flat
on
their
faces
to
worship
his
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
In
which
compensating
adjustment
of
their
noses
,
they
were
pretty
much
like
Treasury
,
Bar
,
and
Bishop
,
and
all
the
rest
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
To
Mrs
Merdle
,
Mrs
Gowan
repaired
on
a
visit
of
self
-
condolence
,
after
having
given
the
gracious
consent
aforesaid
.
 
<EOS>
She
drove
into
town
for
the
purpose
in
a
one
-
horse
carriage
irreverently
called
at
that
period
of
English
history
,
a
pill
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
It
belonged
to
a
job
-
master
in
a
small
way
,
who
drove
it
himself
,
and
who
jobbed
it
by
the
day
,
or
hour
,
to
most
of
the
old
ladies
in
Hampton
Court
Palace
;
but
it
was
a
point
of
ceremony
,
in
that
encampment
,
that
the
whole
equipage
should
be
tacitly
regarded
as
the
private
property
of
the
jobber
for
the
time
being
,
and
that
the
job
-
master
should
betray
personal
knowledge
of
nobody
but
the
jobber
in
possession
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
Circumlocution
Barnacles
,
who
were
the
largest
job
-
masters
in
the
universe
,
always
pretended
to
know
of
no
other
job
but
the
job
immediately
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
was
at
home
,
and
was
in
her
nest
of
crimson
and
gold
,
with
the
parrot
on
a
neighbouring
stem
watching
her
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
he
took
her
for
another
splendid
parrot
of
a
larger
species
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
entered
Mrs
Gowan
,
with
her
favourite
green
fan
,
which
softened
the
light
on
the
spots
of
bloom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
soul
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
tapping
the
back
of
her
friend
's
hand
with
this
fan
after
a
little
indifferent
conversation
,
"
you
are
my
only
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
That
affair
of
Henry
's
that
I
told
you
of
,
is
to
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
how
does
it
strike
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
dying
to
know
,
because
you
represent
and
express
Society
so
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
reviewed
the
bosom
which
Society
was
accustomed
to
review
;
and
having
ascertained
that
show
-
window
of
Mr
Merdle
's
and
the
London
jewellers
'
to
be
in
good
order
,
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
As
to
marriage
on
the
part
of
a
man
,
my
dear
,
Society
requires
that
he
should
retrieve
his
fortunes
by
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Society
requires
that
he
should
gain
by
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Society
requires
that
he
should
found
a
handsome
establishment
by
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Society
does
not
see
,
otherwise
,
what
he
has
to
do
with
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Bird
,
be
quiet
!
"
   
<EOS>
For
the
parrot
on
his
cage
above
them
,
presiding
over
the
conference
as
if
he
were
a
judge
(
and
indeed
he
looked
rather
like
one
)
,
had
wound
up
the
exposition
with
a
shriek
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cases
there
are
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
delicately
crooking
the
little
finger
of
her
favourite
hand
,
and
making
her
remarks
neater
by
that
neat
action
;
"
cases
there
are
where
a
man
is
not
young
or
elegant
,
and
is
rich
,
and
has
a
handsome
establishment
already
.
 
<EOS>
Those
are
of
a
different
kind
.
 
<EOS>
In
such
cases

"
   
Mrs
Merdle
shrugged
her
snowy
shoulders
and
put
her
hand
upon
the
jewel
-
stand
,
checking
a
little
cough
,
as
though
to
add
,
"
why
,
a
man
looks
out
for
this
sort
of
thing
,
my
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
the
parrot
shrieked
again
,
and
she
put
up
her
glass
to
look
at
him
,
and
said
,
"
Bird
!
 
<EOS>
Do
be
quiet
!
"
<EOS>
"
But
,
young
men
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
and
by
young
men
you
know
what
I
mean
,
my
love
---
I
mean
people
's
sons
who
have
the
world
before
them
---
they
must
place
themselves
in
a
better
position
towards
Society
by
marriage
,
or
Society
really
will
not
have
any
patience
with
their
making
fools
of
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Dreadfully
worldly
all
this
sounds
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
leaning
back
in
her
nest
and
putting
up
her
glass
again
,
"
does
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
true
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
with
a
highly
moral
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
it
is
not
to
be
disputed
for
a
moment
,
"
returned
Mrs
Merdle
;
"
because
Society
has
made
up
its
mind
on
the
subject
,
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
were
in
a
more
primitive
state
,
if
we
lived
under
roofs
of
leaves
,
and
kept
cows
and
sheep
and
creatures
instead
of
banker
's
accounts
(
which
would
be
delicious
;
my
dear
,
I
am
pastoral
to
a
degree
,
by
nature
)
,
well
and
good
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
do
n't
live
under
leaves
,
and
keep
cows
and
sheep
and
creatures
.
 
<EOS>
I
perfectly
exhaust
myself
sometimes
,
in
pointing
out
the
distinction
to
Edmund
Sparkler
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
,
looking
over
her
green
fan
when
this
young
gentleman
's
name
was
mentioned
,
replied
as
follows
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
you
know
the
wretched
state
of
the
country
---
those
unfortunate
concessions
of
John
Barnacle
's
!
<EOS>
---
and
you
therefore
know
the
reasons
for
my
being
as
poor
as
Thingummy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
church
mouse
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
suggested
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
of
the
other
proverbial
church
person
---
Job
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Either
will
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
idle
to
disguise
,
consequently
,
that
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
the
position
of
your
son
and
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
add
,
too
,
that
Henry
has
talent
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Which
Edmund
certainly
has
not
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
with
the
greatest
suavity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
---
and
that
his
talent
,
combined
with
disappointment
,
"
Mrs
Gowan
went
on
,
"
has
led
him
into
a
pursuit
which
---
ah
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Such
being
Henry
's
different
position
,
the
question
is
what
is
the
most
inferior
class
of
marriage
to
which
I
can
reconcile
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
was
so
much
engaged
with
the
contemplation
of
her
arms
(
beautiful
-
formed
arms
,
and
the
very
thing
for
bracelets
)
,
that
she
omitted
to
reply
for
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
Roused
at
length
by
the
silence
,
she
folded
the
arms
,
and
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
looked
her
friend
full
in
the
face
,
and
said
interrogatively
,
"
<EOS>
Ye
-
es
?
 
<EOS>
And
then
?
"
   
"
And
then
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
not
quite
so
sweetly
as
before
,
"
I
should
be
glad
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
parrot
,
who
had
been
standing
on
one
leg
since
he
screamed
last
,
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
bobbed
himself
derisively
up
and
down
on
both
legs
,
and
finished
by
standing
on
one
leg
again
,
and
pausing
for
a
reply
,
with
his
head
as
much
awry
as
he
could
possibly
twist
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sounds
mercenary
to
ask
what
the
gentleman
is
to
get
with
the
lady
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
;
"
but
Society
is
perhaps
a
little
mercenary
,
you
know
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
From
what
I
can
make
out
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
"
I
believe
I
may
say
that
Henry
will
be
relieved
from
debt
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Much
in
debt
?
"
asked
Mrs
Merdle
through
her
eyeglass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
tolerably
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
.
   
<EOS>
"
Meaning
the
usual
thing
;
I
understand
;
just
so
,
"
Mrs
Merdle
observed
in
a
comfortable
sort
of
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
that
the
father
will
make
them
an
allowance
of
three
hundred
a
-
year
,
or
perhaps
altogether
something
more
,
which
,
in
Italy
---
"
   
"
Oh
!
 
Going
to
Italy
?
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
Henry
to
study
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
be
at
no
loss
to
guess
why
,
my
dear
.
   
<EOS>
That
dreadful
Art
---
<EOS>
"
   
True
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
hastened
to
spare
the
feelings
of
her
afflicted
friend
.
 
<EOS>
She
understood
.
 
<EOS>
Say
no
more
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
shaking
her
despondent
head
,
"
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Gowan
,
furling
her
green
fan
for
the
moment
,
and
tapping
her
chin
with
it
<EOS>
(
it
was
on
the
way
to
being
a
double
chin
;
might
be
called
a
chin
and
a
half
at
present
)
,
"
that
's
all
!
 
<EOS>
On
the
death
of
the
old
people
,
I
suppose
there
will
be
more
to
come
;
but
how
it
may
be
restricted
or
locked
up
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
that
,
they
may
live
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
they
are
just
the
kind
of
people
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Mrs
Merdle
,
who
really
knew
her
friend
Society
pretty
well
,
and
who
knew
what
Society
's
mothers
were
,
and
what
Society
's
daughters
were
,
and
what
Society
's
matrimonial
market
was
,
and
how
prices
ruled
in
it
,
and
what
scheming
and
counter
-
scheming
took
place
for
the
high
buyers
,
and
what
bargaining
and
huckstering
went
on
,
thought
in
the
depths
of
her
capacious
bosom
that
this
was
a
sufficiently
good
catch
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
,
however
,
what
was
expected
of
her
,
and
perceiving
the
exact
nature
of
the
fiction
to
be
nursed
,
she
took
it
delicately
in
her
arms
,
and
put
her
required
contribution
of
gloss
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
is
all
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
heaving
a
friendly
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
The
fault
is
not
yours
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
exercise
the
strength
of
mind
for
which
you
are
renowned
,
and
make
the
best
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
girl
's
family
have
made
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
"
of
course
,
the
most
strenuous
endeavours
to
---
as
the
lawyers
say
---
to
have
and
to
hold
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
they
have
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
persisted
in
every
possible
objection
,
and
have
worried
myself
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
for
means
to
detach
Henry
from
the
connection
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
you
have
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
all
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
All
has
broken
down
beneath
me
.
 
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Am
<EOS>
I
justified
in
at
last
yielding
my
most
reluctant
consent
to
Henry
's
marrying
among
people
not
in
Society
;
or
,
have
I
acted
with
inexcusable
weakness
?
"
   
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
direct
appeal
,
Mrs
Merdle
assured
Mrs
Gowan
(
speaking
as
a
Priestess
of
Society
)
that
she
was
highly
to
be
commended
,
that
she
was
much
to
be
sympathised
with
,
that
she
had
taken
the
highest
of
parts
,
and
had
come
out
of
the
furnace
refined
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Gowan
,
who
of
course
saw
through
her
own
threadbare
blind
perfectly
,
and
who
knew
that
Mrs
Merdle
saw
through
it
perfectly
,
and
who
knew
that
Society
would
see
through
it
perfectly
,
came
out
of
this
form
,
notwithstanding
,
as
she
had
gone
into
it
,
with
immense
complacency
and
gravity
.
   
<EOS>
The
conference
was
held
at
four
or
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
when
all
the
region
of
Harley
Street
,
Cavendish
Square
,
was
resonant
of
carriage
-
wheels
and
double
-
knocks
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
reached
this
point
when
Mr
Merdle
came
home
from
his
daily
occupation
of
causing
the
British
name
to
be
more
and
more
respected
in
all
parts
of
the
civilised
globe
capable
of
the
appreciation
of
world
-
wide
commercial
enterprise
and
gigantic
combinations
of
skill
and
capital
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
though
nobody
knew
with
the
least
precision
what
Mr
Merdle
's
business
was
,
except
that
it
was
to
coin
money
,
these
were
the
terms
in
which
everybody
defined
it
on
all
ceremonious
occasions
,
and
which
it
was
the
last
new
polite
reading
of
the
parable
of
the
camel
and
the
needle
's
eye
to
accept
without
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
For
a
gentleman
who
had
this
splendid
work
cut
out
for
him
,
Mr
Merdle
looked
a
little
common
,
and
rather
as
if
,
in
the
course
of
his
vast
transactions
,
he
had
accidentally
made
an
interchange
of
heads
with
some
inferior
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
He
presented
himself
before
the
two
ladies
in
the
course
of
a
dismal
stroll
through
his
mansion
,
which
had
no
apparent
object
but
escape
from
the
presence
of
the
chief
butler
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
he
said
,
stopping
short
in
confusion
;
"
I
did
n't
know
there
was
anybody
here
but
the
parrot
.
"
   
<EOS>
However
,
as
Mrs
Merdle
said
,
"
You
can
come
in
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
Mrs
Gowan
said
she
was
just
going
,
and
had
already
risen
to
take
her
leave
,
he
came
in
,
and
stood
looking
out
at
a
distant
window
,
with
his
hands
crossed
under
his
uneasy
coat
-
cuffs
,
clasping
his
wrists
as
if
he
were
taking
himself
into
custody
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
attitude
he
fell
directly
into
a
reverie
from
which
he
was
only
aroused
by
his
wife
's
calling
to
him
from
her
ottoman
,
when
they
had
been
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
turning
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
repeated
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
I
suppose
,
that
you
have
not
heard
a
word
of
my
complaint
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
complaint
,
Mrs
Merdle
?
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
that
you
were
suffering
from
a
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
What
complaint
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
complaint
of
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
A
complaint
of
me
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
<EOS>
---
what
have
I
---
what
may
you
have
to
complain
of
in
me
,
Mrs
Merdle
?
"
 
<EOS>
In
his
withdrawing
,
abstracted
,
pondering
way
,
it
took
him
some
time
to
shape
this
question
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
kind
of
faint
attempt
to
convince
himself
that
he
was
the
master
of
the
house
,
he
concluded
by
presenting
his
forefinger
to
the
parrot
,
who
expressed
his
opinion
on
that
subject
by
instantly
driving
his
bill
into
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
saying
,
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
with
his
wounded
finger
in
his
mouth
,
"
that
you
had
a
complaint
against
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
complaint
which
I
could
scarcely
show
the
justice
of
more
emphatically
,
than
by
having
to
repeat
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
might
as
well
have
stated
it
to
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
far
better
have
stated
it
to
the
bird
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
at
least
have
screamed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
want
me
to
scream
,
Mrs
Merdle
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
taking
a
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
n't
know
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
but
that
you
had
better
do
that
,
<EOS>
than
be
so
moody
and
distraught
.
 
<EOS>
One
would
at
least
know
that
you
were
sensible
of
what
was
going
on
around
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
man
might
scream
,
and
yet
not
be
that
,
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
heavily
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
might
be
dogged
,
as
you
are
at
present
,
without
screaming
,
"
returned
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
true
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
wish
to
know
the
complaint
I
make
against
you
,
it
is
,
in
so
many
plain
words
,
that
you
really
ought
not
to
go
into
Society
unless
you
can
accommodate
yourself
to
Society
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
,
so
twisting
his
hands
into
what
hair
he
had
upon
his
head
that
he
seemed
to
lift
himself
up
by
it
as
he
started
out
of
his
chair
,
cried
:
"
<EOS>
Why

in
the
name
of
all
the
infernal
powers

does
more

I
do

all
provided

And
yet
will
you
tell
me
that
I
ought
n't
to
go
into
Society
?
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
shower
money
upon
it
in
this
way
?
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
might
always
be
said
---
to

to
---
to
harness
myself
to
a
watering
-
cart
full
of
money
,
and
go
about
saturating
Society
every
day
of
my
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
do
n't
be
violent
,
Mr
Merdle
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Violent
?
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
enough
to
make
me
desperate
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
half
of
what
I
do
to
accommodate
Society
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
anything
of
the
sacrifices
I
make
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
returned
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
that
you
receive
the
best
in
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
move
in
the
whole
Society
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
And
I
believe
I
know
(
indeed
,
not
to
make
any
ridiculous
pretence
about
it
,
I
know
I
know
)
who
sustains
you
in
it
,
Mr
Merdle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
retorted
that
gentleman
,
wiping
his
dull
red
and
yellow
face
,
"
I
know
that
as
well
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
were
not
an
ornament
to
Society
,
and
if
I
was
not
a
benefactor
to
Society
,
you
and
I
would
never
have
come
together
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
say
a
benefactor
to
it
,
I
mean
a
person
who
provides
it
with
all
sorts
of
expensive
things
to
eat
and
drink
and
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
tell
me
that
I
am
not
fit
for
it
after
all
I
have
done
for
it
---
after
all
I
have
done
for
it
,
"
repeated
Mr
Merdle
,
with
a
wild
emphasis
that
made
his
wife
lift
up
her
eyelids
,
"
after
all
---
all
!
---
to
tell
me
I
have
no
right
to
mix
with
it
after
all
,
is
a
pretty
reward
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
answered
Mrs
Merdle
composedly
,
"
that
you
ought
to
make
yourself
fit
for
it
by
being
more
degage
,
and
less
preoccupied
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
positive
vulgarity
in
carrying
your
business
affairs
about
with
you
as
you
do
.
"
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
carry
them
about
,
Mrs
Merdle
?
"
asked
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
carry
them
about
?
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
involuntarily
turned
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
nearest
mirror
,
and
asked
,
with
a
slow
determination
of
his
turbid
blood
to
his
temples
,
whether
a
man
was
to
be
called
to
account
for
his
digestion
?
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
physician
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
does
me
no
good
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
changed
her
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
said
she
,
"
your
digestion
is
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
speak
of
your
digestion
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
of
your
manner
.
"
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
returned
her
husband
,
"
<EOS>
I
look
to
you
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
supply
manner
,
and
I
supply
money
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
expect
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
reposing
easily
among
her
cushions
,
"
to
captivate
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
you
to
take
any
trouble
upon
yourself
,
or
to
try
to
be
fascinating
.
 
<EOS>
I
simply
request
you
to
care
about
nothing

or
seem
to
care
about
nothing
---
as
everybody
else
does
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
ever
say
I
care
about
anything
?
"
asked
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
Nobody
would
attend
to
you
if
you
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
show
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Show
what
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
show
?
"
demanded
Mr
Merdle
hurriedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
told
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
show
that
you
carry
your
business
cares
an
projects
about
,
instead
of
leaving
them
in
the
City
,
or
wherever
else
they
belong
to
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
seeming
to
.
<EOS>
Seeming
would
be
quite
enough
:
I
ask
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Whereas
you
could
n't
be
more
occupied
with
your
day
's
calculations
and
combinations
than
you
habitually
show
yourself
to
be
,
if
you
were
a
carpenter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
carpenter
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Merdle
,
checking
something
like
a
groan
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
so
much
mind
being
a
carpenter
,
Mrs
Merdle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
my
complaint
is
,
"
pursued
the
lady
,
disregarding
the
low
remark
,
"
that
it
is
not
the
tone
of
Society
,
and
that
you
ought
to
correct
it
,
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
doubt
of
my
judgment
,
ask
even
Edmund
Sparkler
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
room
had
opened
,
and
Mrs
Merdle
now
surveyed
the
head
of
her
son
through
her
glass
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Edmund
;
we
want
you
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
,
who
had
merely
put
in
his
head
and
looked
round
the
room
without
entering
(
as
if
he
were
searching
the
house
for
that
young
lady
with
no
nonsense
about
her
)
,
upon
this
followed
up
his
head
with
his
body
,
and
stood
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
,
in
a
few
easy
words
adapted
to
his
capacity
,
Mrs
Merdle
stated
the
question
at
issue
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
after
anxiously
feeling
his
shirt
-
collar
as
if
it
were
his
pulse
and
he
were
hypochondriacal
,
observed
,
"
That
he
had
heard
it
noticed
by
fellers
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Edmund
Sparkler
has
heard
it
noticed
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
with
languid
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
doubt
everybody
has
heard
it
noticed
!
"
<EOS>
Which
in
truth
was
no
unreasonable
inference
;
seeing
that
Mr
Sparkler
would
probably
be
the
last
person
,
in
any
assemblage
of
the
human
species
,
to
receive
an
impression
from
anything
that
passed
in
his
presence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Edmund
Sparkler
will
tell
you
,
I
dare
say
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
waving
her
favourite
hand
towards
her
husband
,
"
how
he
has
heard
it
noticed
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
,
after
feeling
his
pulse
as
before
,
"
could
n't
undertake
to
say
what
led
to
it
---
'cause
memory
desperate
loose
.
 
<EOS>
But
being
in
company
with
the
brother
of
a
doosed
fine
gal
---
well
educated
too
---
with
no
biggodd
nonsense
about
her
<EOS>
---
at
the
period
alluded
to
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
the
sister
,
"
remarked
Mrs
Merdle
,
a
little
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
the
brother
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Did
n't
say
a
word
,
ma'am
,
"
answered
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
silent
a
feller
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Equally
hard
up
for
a
remark
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Somebody
said
something
,
"
returned
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
who
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
(
"
Assure
you
I
do
n't
in
the
least
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
But
tell
us
what
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
referred
to
his
pulse
again
,
and
put
himself
through
some
severe
mental
discipline
before
he
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
Fellers
referring
to
my
Governor
---
expression
not
my
own
---
occasionally
compliment
my
Governor
in
a
very
handsome
way
on
being
immensely
rich
and
knowing
---
perfect
phenomenon
of
Buyer
and
Banker
and
that
---
but
say
the
Shop
sits
heavily
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
Say
he
carried
the
Shop
about
,
on
his
back
rather
---
like
Jew
clothesmen
with
too
much
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
rising
,
with
her
floating
drapery
about
her
,
"
is
exactly
my
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
Edmund
,
give
me
your
arm
up
-
stairs
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
,
left
alone
to
meditate
on
a
better
conformation
of
himself
to
Society
,
looked
out
of
nine
windows
in
succession
,
and
appeared
to
see
nine
wastes
of
space
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
thus
entertained
himself
he
went
down
-
stairs
,
and
looked
intently
at
all
the
carpets
on
the
ground
-
floor
;
and
then
came
up
-
stairs
again
,
and
looked
intently
at
all
the
carpets
on
the
first
-
floor
;
as
if
they
were
gloomy
depths
,
in
unison
with
his
oppressed
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Through
all
the
rooms
he
wandered
,
as
he
always
did
,
like
the
last
person
on
earth
who
had
any
business
to
approach
them
.
 
<EOS>
Let
Mrs
Merdle
announce
,
with
all
her
might
,
that
she
was
at
Home
ever
so
many
nights
in
a
season
,
she
could
not
announce
more
widely
and
unmistakably
than
Mr
Merdle
did
that
he
was
never
at
home
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
he
met
the
chief
butler
,
the
sight
of
which
splendid
retainer
always
finished
him
.
 
<EOS>
Extinguished
by
this
great
creature
,
he
sneaked
to
his
dressing
-
room
,
and
there
remained
shut
up
until
he
rode
out
to
dinner
,
with
Mrs
Merdle
,
in
her
own
handsome
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
At
dinner
,
he
was
envied
and
flattered
as
a
being
of
might
,
was
Treasuried
,
Barred
,
and
Bishoped
,
as
much
as
he
would
;
and
an
hour
after
midnight
came
home
alone
,
and
being
instantly
put
out
again
in
his
own
hall
,
like
a
rushlight
,
by
the
chief
butler
,
went
sighing
to
bed
.

Chapter
34
.
<EOS>
A
Shoal
of
Barnacles
 
<EOS>
Mr
Henry
Gowan
and
the
dog
were
established
frequenters
of
the
cottage
,
and
the
day
was
fixed
for
the
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
to
be
a
convocation
of
Barnacles
on
the
occasion
,
in
order
that
that
very
high
and
very
large
family
might
shed
as
much
lustre
on
the
marriage
as
so
dim
an
event
was
capable
of
receiving
.
   
<EOS>
To
have
got
the
whole
Barnacle
family
together
would
have
been
impossible
for
two
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
Firstly
,
because
no
building
could
have
held
all
the
members
and
connections
of
that
illustrious
house
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
because
wherever
there
was
a
square
yard
of
ground
in
British
occupation
under
the
sun
or
moon
,
with
a
public
post
upon
it
,
sticking
to
that
post
was
a
Barnacle
.
 
<EOS>
No
intrepid
navigator
could
plant
a
flag
-
staff
upon
any
spot
of
earth
,
and
take
possession
of
it
in
the
British
name
,
but
to
that
spot
of
earth
,
so
soon
as
the
discovery
was
known
,
the
Circumlocution
Office
sent
out
a
Barnacle
and
a
despatch
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
Barnacles
were
all
over
the
world
,
in
every
direction
---
despatch
-
boxing
the
compass
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
while
the
so
-
potent
art
of
Prospero
himself
would
have
failed
in
summoning
the
Barnacles
from
every
speck
of
ocean
and
dry
land
on
which
there
was
nothing
(
except
mischief
)
to
be
done
and
anything
to
be
pocketed
,
it
was
perfectly
feasible
to
assemble
a
good
many
Barnacles
.
 
<EOS>
This
Mrs
Gowan
applied
herself
to
do
;
calling
on
Mr
Meagles
frequently
with
new
additions
to
the
list
,
and
holding
conferences
with
that
gentleman
when
he
was
not
engaged
(
as
he
generally
was
at
this
period
)
in
examining
and
paying
the
debts
of
his
future
son
-
in
-
law
,
in
the
apartment
of
scales
and
scoops
.
   
<EOS>
One
marriage
guest
there
was
,
in
reference
to
whose
presence
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
felt
a
nearer
interest
and
concern
than
in
the
attendance
of
the
most
elevated
Barnacle
expected
;
though
he
was
far
from
insensible
of
the
honour
of
having
such
company
.
 
<EOS>
This
guest
was
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
But
Clennam
had
made
a
promise
he
held
sacred
,
among
the
trees
that
summer
night
,
and
,
in
the
chivalry
of
his
heart
,
regarded
it
as
binding
him
to
many
implied
obligations
.
 
<EOS>
In
forgetfulness
of
himself
,
and
delicate
service
to
her
on
all
occasions
,
he
was
never
to
fail
;
to
begin
it
,
he
answered
Mr
Meagles
cheerfully
,
"
I
shall
come
,
of
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
partner
,
Daniel
Doyce
,
was
something
of
a
stumbling
-
block
in
Mr
Meagles
's
way
,
the
worthy
gentleman
being
not
at
all
clear
in
his
own
anxious
mind
but
that
the
mingling
of
Daniel
with
official
Barnacleism
might
produce
some
explosive
combination
,
even
at
a
marriage
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
The
national
offender
,
however
,
lightened
him
of
his
uneasiness
by
coming
down
to
Twickenham
to
represent
that
he
begged
,
with
the
freedom
of
an
old
friend
,
and
as
a
favour
to
one
,
that
he
might
not
be
invited
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
,
"
said
he
,
"
as
my
business
with
this
set
of
gentlemen
was
to
do
a
public
duty
and
a
public
service
,
and
as
their
business
with
me
was
to
prevent
it
by
wearing
my
soul
out
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
had
better
not
eat
and
drink
together
with
a
show
of
being
of
one
mind
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
was
much
amused
by
his
friend
's
oddity
;
and
patronised
him
with
a
more
protecting
air
of
allowance
than
usual
,
when
he
rejoined
:
"
Well
,
well
,
Dan
,
you
shall
have
your
own
crotchety
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
Mr
Henry
Gowan
,
as
the
time
approached
,
Clennam
tried
to
convey
by
all
quiet
and
unpretending
means
,
that
he
was
frankly
and
disinterestedly
desirous
of
tendering
him
any
friendship
he
would
accept
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gowan
treated
him
in
return
with
his
usual
ease
,
and
with
his
usual
show
of
confidence
,
which
was
no
confidence
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Clennam
,
"
he
happened
to
remark
in
the
course
of
conversation
one
day
,
when
they
were
walking
near
the
Cottage
within
a
week
of
the
marriage
,
"
I
am
a
disappointed
man
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
know
already
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
said
Clennam
,
a
little
embarrassed
,
"
I
scarcely
know
how
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
returned
Gowan
,
"
I
belong
to
a
clan
,
or
a
clique
,
or
a
family
,
or
a
connection
,
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
,
that
might
have
provided
for
me
in
any
one
of
fifty
ways
,
and
that
took
it
into
its
head
not
to
do
it
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
So
here
I
am
,
a
poor
devil
of
an
artist
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
was
beginning
,
"
But
on
the
other
hand
---
"
when
Gowan
took
him
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
good
fortune
of
being
beloved
by
a
beautiful
and
charming
girl
whom
I
love
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
(
"
Is
there
much
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
Clennam
thought
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
thought
it
,
felt
ashamed
of
himself
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
of
finding
a
father
-
in
-
law
who
is
a
capital
fellow
and
a
liberal
good
old
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
I
had
other
prospects
washed
and
combed
into
my
childish
head
when
it
was
washed
and
combed
for
me
,
and
I
took
them
to
a
public
school
when
I
washed
and
combed
it
for
myself
,
and
I
am
here
without
them
,
and
thus
I
am
a
disappointed
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
thought
(
and
as
he
thought
it
,
again
felt
ashamed
of
himself
)
,
was
this
notion
of
being
disappointed
in
life
,
an
assertion
of
station
which
the
bridegroom
brought
into
the
family
as
his
property
,
having
already
carried
it
detrimentally
into
his
pursuit
?
 
<EOS>
And
was
it
a
hopeful
or
a
promising
thing
anywhere
?
   
<EOS>
"
Not
bitterly
disappointed
,
I
think
,
"
he
said
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
Hang
it
,
no
;
not
bitterly
,
"
laughed
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
people
are
not
worth
that
---
though
they
are
charming
fellows
,
and
I
have
the
greatest
affection
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
's
pleasant
to
show
them
that
I
can
do
without
them
,
and
that
they
may
all
go
to
the
Devil
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
again
,
most
men
are
disappointed
in
life
,
somehow
or
other
,
and
influenced
by
their
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
dear
good
world
,
and
I
love
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
lies
fair
before
you
now
,
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fair
as
this
summer
river
,
"
cried
the
other
,
with
enthusiasm
,
"
and
by
Jove
I
glow
with
admiration
of
it
,
and
with
ardour
to
run
a
race
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
best
of
old
worlds
!
 
<EOS>
And
my
calling
!
 
<EOS>
The
best
of
old
callings
,
is
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Full
of
interest
and
ambition
,
I
conceive
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
imposition
,
"
added
Gowan
,
laughing
;
"
we
wo
n't
leave
out
the
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
not
break
down
in
that
;
but
there
,
my
being
a
disappointed
man
may
show
itself
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
able
to
face
it
out
gravely
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Between
you
and
me
,
I
think
there
is
some
danger
of
my
being
just
enough
soured
not
to
be
able
to
do
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
do
what
?
"
asked
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
keep
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
To
help
myself
in
my
turn
,
as
the
man
before
me
helps
himself
in
his
,
and
pass
the
bottle
of
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
To
keep
up
the
pretence
as
to
labour
,
and
study
,
and
patience
,
and
being
devoted
to
my
art
,
and
giving
up
many
solitary
days
to
it
,
and
abandoning
many
pleasures
for
it
,
and
living
in
it
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
---
in
short
,
to
pass
the
bottle
of
smoke
according
to
rule
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
well
for
a
man
to
respect
his
own
vocation
,
whatever
it
is
;
and
to
think
himself
bound
to
uphold
it
,
and
to
claim
for
it
the
respect
it
deserves
;
is
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
Arthur
reasoned
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
your
vocation
,
Gowan
,
may
really
demand
this
suit
and
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
that
all
Art
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
good
fellow
you
are
,
Clennam
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
other
,
stopping
to
look
at
him
,
as
if
with
irrepressible
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
capital
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
never
been
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
easy
to
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
so
cruel
if
he
had
meant
it
,
that
Clennam
firmly
resolved
to
believe
he
did
not
mean
it
.
 
<EOS>
Gowan
,
without
pausing
,
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
laughingly
and
lightly
went
on
:
   
<EOS>
"
Clennam
,
I
do
n't
like
to
dispel
your
generous
visions
,
and
I
would
give
any
money
(
if
I
had
any
)
,
to
live
in
such
a
rose
-
coloured
mist
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
I
do
in
my
trade
,
I
do
to
sell
.
 
<EOS>
What
all
we
fellows
do
,
we
do
to
sell
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
did
n't
want
to
sell
it
for
the
most
we
can
get
for
it
,
we
should
n't
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Being
work
,
it
has
to
be
done
;
but
it
's
easily
enough
done
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
rest
is
hocus
-
pocus
.
   
<EOS>
Now
here
's
one
of
the
advantages
,
or
disadvantages
,
of
knowing
a
disappointed
man
.
 
<EOS>
You
hear
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Whatever
he
had
heard
,
and
whether
it
deserved
that
name
or
another
,
it
sank
into
Clennam
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
so
took
root
there
,
that
he
began
to
fear
Henry
Gowan
would
always
be
a
trouble
to
him
,
and
that
so
far
he
had
gained
little
or
nothing
from
the
dismissal
of
Nobody
,
with
all
his
inconsistencies
,
anxieties
,
and
contradictions
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
a
contest
still
always
going
on
in
his
breast
between
his
promise
to
keep
Gowan
in
none
but
good
aspects
before
the
mind
of
Mr
Meagles
,
and
his
enforced
observation
of
Gowan
in
aspects
that
had
no
good
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
could
he
quite
support
his
own
conscientious
nature
against
misgivings
that
he
distorted
and
discoloured
himself
,
by
reminding
himself
that
he
never
sought
those
discoveries
,
and
that
he
would
have
avoided
them
with
willingness
and
great
relief
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
never
could
forget
what
he
had
been
;
and
he
knew
that
he
had
once
disliked
Gowan
for
no
better
reason
than
that
he
had
come
in
his
way
.
   
<EOS>
Harassed
by
these
thoughts
,
he
now
began
to
wish
the
marriage
over
,
Gowan
and
his
young
wife
gone
,
and
himself
left
to
fulfil
his
promise
,
and
discharge
the
generous
function
he
had
accepted
.
 
<EOS>
This
last
week
was
,
in
truth
,
an
uneasy
interval
for
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
Before
Pet
,
or
before
Gowan
,
Mr
Meagles
was
radiant
;
but
Clennam
had
more
than
once
found
him
alone
,
with
his
view
of
the
scales
and
scoop
much
blurred
,
and
had
often
seen
him
look
after
the
lovers
,
in
the
garden
or
elsewhere
when
he
was
not
seen
by
them
,
with
the
old
clouded
face
on
which
Gowan
had
fallen
like
a
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
arrangement
of
the
house
for
the
great
occasion
,
many
little
reminders
of
the
old
travels
of
the
father
and
mother
and
daughter
had
to
be
disturbed
and
passed
from
hand
to
hand
;
and
sometimes
,
in
the
midst
of
these
mute
witnesses
,
to
the
life
they
had
had
together
,
even
Pet
herself
would
yield
to
lamenting
and
weeping
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Meagles
,
the
blithest
and
busiest
of
mothers
,
went
about
singing
and
cheering
everybody
;
but
she
,
honest
soul
,
had
her
flights
into
store
rooms
,
where
she
would
cry
until
her
eyes
were
red
,
and
would
then
come
out
,
attributing
that
appearance
to
pickled
onions
and
pepper
,
and
singing
clearer
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tickit
,
finding
no
balsam
for
a
wounded
mind
in
Buchan
's
Domestic
Medicine
,
suffered
greatly
from
low
spirits
,
and
from
moving
recollections
of
Minnie
's
infancy
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
latter
was
powerful
with
her
,
she
usually
sent
up
secret
messages
importing
that
she
was
not
in
parlour
condition
as
to
her
attire
,
and
that
she
solicited
a
sight
of
"
her
child
"
in
the
kitchen
;
there
,
she
would
bless
her
child
's
face
,
and
bless
her
child
's
heart
,
and
hug
her
child
,
in
a
medley
of
tears
and
congratulations
,
chopping
-
boards
,
rolling
-
pins
,
and
pie
-
crust
,
with
the
tenderness
of
an
old
attached
servant
,
which
is
a
very
pretty
tenderness
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
But
all
days
come
that
are
to
be
;
and
the
marriage
-
day
was
to
be
,
and
it
came
;
and
with
it
came
all
the
Barnacles
who
were
bidden
to
the
feast
.
<EOS>
There
was
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
,
from
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
and
Mews
Street
,
Grosvenor
Square
,
with
the
expensive
Mrs
Tite
Barnacle
NEE
Stiltstalking
,
who
made
the
Quarter
Days
so
long
in
coming
,
and
the
three
expensive
Miss
Tite
Barnacles
,
double
-
loaded
with
accomplishments
and
ready
to
go
off
,
and
yet
not
going
off
with
the
sharpness
of
flash
and
bang
that
might
have
been
expected
,
but
rather
hanging
fire
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Barnacle
junior
,
also
from
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
leaving
the
Tonnage
of
the
country
,
which
he
was
somehow
supposed
to
take
under
his
protection
,
to
look
after
itself
,
and
,
sooth
to
say
,
not
at
all
impairing
the
efficiency
of
its
protection
by
leaving
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
engaging
Young
Barnacle
,
deriving
from
the
sprightly
side
of
the
family
,
also
from
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
gaily
and
agreeably
helping
the
occasion
along
,
and
treating
it
,
in
his
sparkling
way
,
as
one
of
the
official
forms
and
fees
of
the
Church
Department
of
How
not
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
three
other
Young
Barnacles
from
three
other
offices
,
insipid
to
all
the
senses
,
and
terribly
in
want
of
seasoning
,
doing
the
marriage
as
they
would
have
"
done
"
the
Nile
,
Old
Rome
,
the
new
singer
,
or
Jerusalem
.
   
<EOS>
But
there
was
greater
game
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
himself
,
in
the
odour
of
Circumlocution
---
with
the
very
smell
of
Despatch
-
Boxes
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
was
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
,
who
had
risen
to
official
heights
on
the
wings
of
one
indignant
idea
,
and
that
was
,
My
Lords
,
that
I
am
yet
to
be
told
that
it
behoves
a
Minister
of
this
free
country
to
set
bounds
to
the
philanthropy
,
to
cramp
the
charity
,
to
fetter
the
public
spirit
,
to
contract
the
enterprise
,
to
damp
the
independent
self
-
reliance
,
of
its
people
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
,
in
other
words
,
that
this
great
statesman
was
always
yet
to
be
told
that
it
behoved
the
Pilot
of
the
ship
to
do
anything
but
prosper
in
the
private
loaf
and
fish
trade
ashore
,
the
crew
being
able
,
by
dint
of
hard
pumping
,
to
keep
the
ship
above
water
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
sublime
discovery
in
the
great
art
How
not
to
do
it
,
Lord
Decimus
had
long
sustained
the
highest
glory
of
the
Barnacle
family
;
and
let
any
ill
-
advised
member
of
either
House
but
try
How
to
do
it
by
bringing
in
a
Bill
to
do
it
,
that
Bill
was
as
good
as
dead
and
buried
when
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
rose
up
in
his
place
and
solemnly
said
,
soaring
into
indignant
majesty
as
the
Circumlocution
cheering
soared
around
him
,
that
he
was
yet
to
be
told
,
My
Lords
,
that
it
behoved
him
as
the
Minister
of
this
free
country
,
to
set
bounds
to
the
philanthropy
,
to
cramp
the
charity
,
to
fetter
the
public
spirit
,
to
contract
the
enterprise
,
to
damp
the
independent
self
-
reliance
,
of
its
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
discovery
of
this
Behoving
Machine
was
the
discovery
of
the
political
perpetual
motion
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
wore
out
,
though
it
was
always
going
round
and
round
in
all
the
State
Departments
.
   
<EOS>
And
there
,
with
his
noble
friend
and
relative
Lord
Decimus
,
was
William
Barnacle
,
who
had
made
the
ever
-
famous
coalition
with
Tudor
Stiltstalking
,
and
who
always
kept
ready
his
own
particular
recipe
for
How
not
to
do
it
;
sometimes
tapping
the
Speaker
,
and
drawing
it
fresh
out
of
him
,
with
a
"
First
,
I
will
beg
you
,
sir
,
to
inform
the
House
what
Precedent
we
have
for
the
course
into
which
the
honourable
gentleman
would
precipitate
us
;
"
sometimes
asking
the
honourable
gentleman
to
favour
him
with
his
own
version
of
the
Precedent
;
sometimes
telling
the
honourable
gentleman
that
he
(
William
Barnacle
)
would
search
for
a
Precedent
;
and
oftentimes
crushing
the
honourable
gentleman
flat
on
the
spot
by
telling
him
there
was
no
Precedent
.
 
<EOS>
But
Precedent
and
Precipitate
were
,
under
all
circumstances
,
the
well
-
matched
pair
of
battle
-
horses
of
this
able
Circumlocutionist
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
that
the
unhappy
honourable
gentleman
had
been
trying
in
vain
,
for
twenty
-
five
years
,
to
precipitate
William
Barnacle
into
this
---
William
Barnacle
still
put
it
to
the
House
,
and
(
at
second
-
hand
or
so
)
to
the
country
,
whether
he
was
to
be
precipitated
into
this
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
that
it
was
utterly
irreconcilable
with
the
nature
of
things
and
course
of
events
that
the
wretched
honourable
gentleman
could
possibly
produce
a
Precedent
for
this
---
William
Barnacle
would
nevertheless
thank
the
honourable
gentleman
for
that
ironical
cheer
,
and
would
close
with
him
upon
that
issue
,
and
would
tell
him
to
his
teeth
that
there
Was
NO
Precedent
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
perhaps
have
been
objected
that
the
William
Barnacle
wisdom
was
not
high
wisdom
or
the
earth
it
bamboozled
would
never
have
been
made
,
or
,
if
made
in
a
rash
mistake
,
would
have
remained
blank
mud
.
 
<EOS>
But
Precedent
and
Precipitate
together
frightened
all
objection
out
of
most
people
.
   
<EOS>
And
there
,
too
,
was
another
Barnacle
,
a
lively
one
,
who
had
leaped
through
twenty
places
in
quick
succession
,
and
was
always
in
two
or
three
at
once
,
and
who
was
the
much
-
respected
inventor
of
an
art
which
he
practised
with
great
success
and
admiration
in
all
Barnacle
Governments
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
,
when
he
was
asked
a
Parliamentary
question
on
any
one
topic
,
to
return
an
answer
on
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
done
immense
service
,
and
brought
him
into
high
esteem
with
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
   
<EOS>
And
there
,
too
,
was
a
sprinkling
of
less
distinguished
Parliamentary
Barnacles
,
who
had
not
as
yet
got
anything
snug
,
and
were
going
through
their
probation
to
prove
their
worthiness
.
<EOS>
These
Barnacles
perched
upon
staircases
and
hid
in
passages
,
waiting
their
orders
to
make
houses
or
not
to
make
houses
;
and
they
did
all
their
hearing
,
and
ohing
,
and
cheering
,
and
barking
,
under
directions
from
the
heads
of
the
family
;
and
they
put
dummy
motions
on
the
paper
in
the
way
of
other
men
's
motions
;
and
they
stalled
disagreeable
subjects
off
until
late
in
the
night
and
late
in
the
session
,
and
then
with
virtuous
patriotism
cried
out
that
it
was
too
late
;
and
they
went
down
into
the
country
,
whenever
they
were
sent
,
and
swore
that
Lord
Decimus
had
revived
trade
from
a
swoon
,
and
commerce
from
a
fit
,
and
had
doubled
the
harvest
of
corn
,
quadrupled
the
harvest
of
hay
,
and
prevented
no
end
of
gold
from
flying
out
of
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
Also
these
Barnacles
were
dealt
,
by
the
heads
of
the
family
,
like
so
many
cards
below
the
court
-
cards
,
to
public
meetings
and
dinners
;
where
they
bore
testimony
to
all
sorts
of
services
on
the
part
of
their
noble
and
honourable
relatives
,
and
buttered
the
Barnacles
on
all
sorts
of
toasts
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
stood
,
under
similar
orders
,
at
all
sorts
of
elections
;
and
they
turned
out
of
their
own
seats
,
on
the
shortest
notice
and
the
most
unreasonable
terms
,
to
let
in
other
men
;
and
they
fetched
and
carried
,
and
toadied
and
jobbed
,
and
corrupted
,
and
ate
heaps
of
dirt
,
and
were
indefatigable
in
the
public
service
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
was
not
a
list
,
in
all
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
of
places
that
might
fall
vacant
anywhere
within
half
a
century
,
from
a
lord
of
the
Treasury
to
a
Chinese
consul
,
and
up
again
to
a
governor
-
general
of
India
,
but
as
applicants
for
such
places
,
the
names
of
some
or
of
every
one
of
these
hungry
and
adhesive
Barnacles
were
down
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
necessarily
but
a
sprinkling
of
any
class
of
Barnacles
that
attended
the
marriage
,
for
there
were
not
two
score
in
all
,
and
what
is
that
subtracted
from
Legion
!
 
<EOS>
But
the
sprinkling
was
a
swarm
in
the
Twickenham
cottage
,
and
filled
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
Barnacle
(
assisted
by
a
Barnacle
)
married
the
happy
pair
,
and
it
behoved
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
himself
to
conduct
Mrs
Meagles
to
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
The
entertainment
was
not
as
agreeable
and
natural
as
it
might
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
hove
down
by
his
good
company
while
he
highly
appreciated
it
,
was
not
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
was
herself
,
and
that
did
not
improve
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
fiction
that
it
was
not
Mr
Meagles
who
had
stood
in
the
way
,
but
that
it
was
the
Family
greatness
,
and
that
the
Family
greatness
had
made
a
concession
,
and
there
was
now
a
soothing
unanimity
,
pervaded
the
affair
,
though
it
was
never
openly
expressed
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
Barnacles
felt
that
they
for
their
parts
would
have
done
with
the
Meagleses
when
the
present
patronising
occasion
was
over
;
and
the
Meagleses
felt
the
same
for
their
parts
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Gowan
asserting
his
rights
as
a
disappointed
man
who
had
his
grudge
against
the
family
,
and
who
,
perhaps
,
had
allowed
his
mother
to
have
them
there
,
as
much
in
the
hope
it
might
give
them
some
annoyance
as
with
any
other
benevolent
object
,
aired
his
pencil
and
his
poverty
ostentatiously
before
them
,
and
told
them
he
hoped
in
time
to
settle
a
crust
of
bread
and
cheese
on
his
wife
,
and
that
he
begged
such
of
them
as
(
more
fortunate
than
himself
)
came
in
for
any
good
thing
,
and
could
buy
a
picture
,
to
please
to
remember
the
poor
painter
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Lord
Decimus
,
who
was
a
wonder
on
his
own
Parliamentary
pedestal
,
turned
out
to
be
the
windiest
creature
here
:
proposing
happiness
to
the
bride
and
bridegroom
in
a
series
of
platitudes
that
would
have
made
the
hair
of
any
sincere
disciple
and
believer
stand
on
end
;
and
trotting
,
with
the
complacency
of
an
idiotic
elephant
,
among
howling
labyrinths
of
sentences
which
he
seemed
to
take
for
high
roads
,
and
never
so
much
as
wanted
to
get
out
of
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
could
not
but
feel
that
there
was
a
person
in
company
,
who
would
have
disturbed
his
life
-
long
sitting
to
Sir
Thomas
Lawrence
in
full
official
character
,
if
such
disturbance
had
been
possible
:
while
Barnacle
junior
did
,
with
indignation
,
communicate
to
two
vapid
gentlemen
,
his
relatives
,
that
there
was
a
feller
here
,
look
here
,
who
had
come
to
our
Department
without
an
appointment
and
said
he
wanted
to
know
,
you
know
;
and
that
,
look
here
,
if
he
was
to
break
out
now
,
as
he
might
you
know
(
for
you
never
could
tell
what
an
ungentlemanly
Radical
of
that
sort
would
be
up
to
next
)
,
and
was
to
say
,
look
here
,
that
he
wanted
to
know
this
moment
,
you
know
,
that
would
be
jolly
;
would
n't
it
?
   
<EOS>
The
pleasantest
part
of
the
occasion
by
far
,
to
Clennam
,
was
the
painfullest
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
at
last
hung
about
Pet
in
the
room
with
the
two
pictures
(
where
the
company
were
not
)
,
before
going
with
her
to
the
threshold
which
she
could
never
recross
to
be
the
old
Pet
and
the
old
delight
,
nothing
could
be
more
natural
and
simple
than
the
three
were
.
 
<EOS>
Gowan
himself
was
touched
,
and
answered
Mr
Meagles
's
"
O
Gowan
,
take
care
of
her
,
take
care
of
her
!
"
<EOS>
with
an
earnest
"
Do
n't
be
so
broken
-
hearted
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
I
will
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
so
,
with
the
last
sobs
and
last
loving
words
,
and
a
last
look
to
Clennam
of
confidence
in
his
promise
,
Pet
fell
back
in
the
carriage
,
and
her
husband
waved
his
hand
,
and
they
were
away
for
Dover
;
though
not
until
the
faithful
Mrs
Tickit
,
in
her
silk
gown
and
jet
black
curls
,
had
rushed
out
from
some
hiding
-
place
,
and
thrown
both
her
shoes
after
the
carriage
:
an
apparition
which
occasioned
great
surprise
to
the
distinguished
company
at
the
windows
.
   
<EOS>
The
said
company
being
now
relieved
from
further
attendance
,
and
the
chief
Barnacles
being
rather
hurried
(
for
they
had
it
in
hand
just
then
to
send
a
mail
or
two
which
was
in
danger
of
going
straight
to
its
destination
,
beating
about
the
seas
like
the
Flying
Dutchman
,
and
to
arrange
with
complexity
for
the
stoppage
of
a
good
deal
of
important
business
otherwise
in
peril
of
being
done
)
,
went
their
several
ways
;
with
all
affability
conveying
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
that
general
assurance
that
what
they
had
been
doing
there
,
they
had
been
doing
at
a
sacrifice
for
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
's
good
,
which
they
always
conveyed
to
Mr
John
Bull
in
their
official
condescension
to
that
most
unfortunate
creature
.
   
<EOS>
A
miserable
blank
remained
in
the
house
and
in
the
hearts
of
the
father
and
mother
and
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
called
only
one
remembrance
to
his
aid
,
that
really
did
him
good
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
gratifying
,
Arthur
,
"
he
said
,
"
after
all
,
to
look
back
upon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
past
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
---
but
I
mean
the
company
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
had
made
him
much
more
low
and
unhappy
at
the
time
,
but
now
it
really
did
him
good
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
gratifying
,
"
he
said
,
often
repeating
the
remark
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
high
company

<EOS>
What
was
behind
Mr
Pancks
on
Little
Dorrit
's
Hand
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
time
that
Mr
Pancks
,
in
discharge
of
his
compact
with
Clennam
,
revealed
to
him
the
whole
of
his
gipsy
story
,
and
told
him
Little
Dorrit
's
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
was
heir
-
at
-
law
to
a
great
estate
that
had
long
lain
unknown
of
,
unclaimed
,
and
accumulating
.
 
<EOS>
His
right
was
now
clear
,
nothing
interposed
in
his
way
,
the
Marshalsea
gates
stood
open
,
the
Marshalsea
walls
were
down
,
a
few
flourishes
of
his
pen
,
and
he
was
extremely
rich
.
   
<EOS>
In
his
tracking
out
of
the
claim
to
its
complete
establishment
,
Mr
Pancks
had
shown
a
sagacity
that
nothing
could
baffle
,
and
a
patience
and
secrecy
that
nothing
could
tire
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
little
thought
,
sir
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
when
you
and
I
crossed
Smithfield
that
night
,
and
I
told
you
what
sort
of
a
Collector
<EOS>
I
was
,
that
this
would
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
little
thought
,
sir
,
when
I
told
you
you
were
not
of
the
Clennams
of
Cornwall
,
that
I
was
ever
going
to
tell
you
who
were
of
the
Dorrits
of
Dorsetshire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
went
on
to
detail
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
having
that
name
recorded
in
his
note
-
book
,
he
was
first
attracted
by
the
name
alone
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
having
often
found
two
exactly
similar
names
,
even
belonging
to
the
same
place
,
to
involve
no
traceable
consanguinity
,
near
or
distant
,
he
did
not
at
first
give
much
heed
to
this
,
except
in
the
way
of
speculation
as
to
what
a
surprising
change
would
be
made
in
the
condition
of
a
little
seamstress
,
if
she
could
be
shown
to
have
any
interest
in
so
large
a
property
.
<EOS>
How
he
rather
supposed
himself
to
have
pursued
the
idea
into
its
next
degree
,
because
there
was
something
uncommon
in
the
quiet
little
seamstress
,
which
pleased
him
and
provoked
his
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
How
he
had
felt
his
way
inch
by
inch
,
and
"
Moled
it
out
,
sir
"
<EOS>
(
that
was
Mr
Pancks
's
expression
)
,
grain
by
grain
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
in
the
beginning
of
the
labour
described
by
this
new
verb
,
and
to
render
which
the
more
expressive
Mr
Pancks
shut
his
eyes
in
pronouncing
it
and
shook
his
hair
over
them
,
he
had
alternated
from
sudden
lights
and
hopes
to
sudden
darkness
and
no
hopes
,
and
back
again
,
and
back
again
.
<EOS>
How
he
had
made
acquaintances
in
the
Prison
,
expressly
that
he
might
come
and
go
there
as
all
other
comers
and
goers
did
;
and
how
his
first
ray
of
light
was
unconsciously
given
him
by
Mr
Dorrit
himself
and
by
his
son
;
to
both
of
whom
he
easily
became
known
;
with
both
of
whom
he
talked
much
,
casually
(
"
but
always
Moleing
you
'll
observe
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
)
:
<EOS>
and
from
whom
he
derived
,
without
being
at
all
suspected
,
two
or
three
little
points
of
family
history
which
,
as
he
began
to
hold
clues
of
his
own
,
suggested
others
.
 
<EOS>
How
it
had
at
length
become
plain
to
Mr
Pancks
that
he
had
made
a
real
discovery
of
the
heir
-
at
-
law
to
a
great
fortune
,
and
that
his
discovery
had
but
to
be
ripened
to
legal
fulness
and
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
had
,
thereupon
,
sworn
his
landlord
,
Mr
Rugg
,
to
secrecy
in
a
solemn
manner
,
and
taken
him
into
Moleing
partnership
.
   
<EOS>
How
they
had
employed
John
Chivery
as
their
sole
clerk
and
agent
,
seeing
to
whom
he
was
devoted
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
,
until
the
present
hour
,
when
authorities
mighty
in
the
Bank
and
learned
in
the
law
declared
their
successful
labours
ended
,
they
had
confided
in
no
other
human
being
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
if
the
whole
thing
had
broken
down
,
sir
,
"
concluded
Pancks
,
"
at
the
very
last
,
say
the
day
before
the
other
day
when
I
showed
you
our
papers
in
the
Prison
yard
,
or
say
that
very
day
,
nobody
but
ourselves
would
have
been
cruelly
disappointed
,
or
a
penny
the
worse
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
,
who
had
been
almost
incessantly
shaking
hands
with
him
throughout
the
narrative
,
was
reminded
by
this
to
say
,
in
an
amazement
which
even
the
preparation
he
had
had
for
the
main
disclosure
smoothed
down
,
"
My
dear
Mr
Pancks
,
this
must
have
cost
you
a
great
sum
of
money
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
sir
,
"
said
the
triumphant
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
trifle
,
though
we
did
it
as
cheap
as
it
could
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
outlay
was
a
difficulty
,
let
me
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
difficulty
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
difficulties
you
have
so
wonderfully
conquered
in
the
whole
business
!
"
shaking
his
hand
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
how
I
did
it
,
"
said
the
delighted
Pancks
,
putting
his
hair
into
a
condition
as
elevated
as
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
First
,
I
spent
all
I
had
of
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
n't
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
"
said
Clennam
:
"
<EOS>
not
that
it
matters
now
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
what
did
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
answered
Pancks
,
"
I
borrowed
a
sum
of
my
proprietor
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Of
Mr
Casby
?
<EOS>
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
fine
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Noble
old
boy
;
an't
he
<EOS>
?
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
entering
on
a
series
of
the
dryest
snorts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Generous
old
buck
.
 
<EOS>
Confiding
old
boy
.
<EOS>
Philanthropic
old
buck
.
 
<EOS>
Benevolent
old
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Twenty
per
cent
.
 
<EOS>
I
engaged
to
pay
him
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
never
do
business
for
less
at
our
shop
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
felt
an
awkward
consciousness
of
having
,
in
his
exultant
condition
,
been
a
little
premature
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
to
that
boiling
-
over
old
Christian
,
"
Mr
Pancks
pursued
,
appearing
greatly
to
relish
this
descriptive
epithet
,
"
that
I
had
got
a
little
project
on
hand
;
a
hopeful
one
;
I
told
him
a
hopeful
one
;
which
wanted
a
certain
small
capital
.
 
<EOS>
I
proposed
to
him
to
lend
me
the
money
on
my
note
.
 
<EOS>
Which
he
did
,
at
twenty
;
sticking
the
twenty
on
in
a
business
-
like
way
,
and
putting
it
into
the
note
,
to
look
like
a
part
of
the
principal
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
broken
down
after
that
,
I
should
have
been
his
grubber
for
the
next
seven
years
at
half
wages
and
double
grind
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
's
a
perfect
Patriarch
;
and
it
would
do
a
man
good
to
serve
him
on
such
terms
---
on
any
terms
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
for
his
life
could
not
have
said
with
confidence
whether
Pancks
really
thought
so
or
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
that
was
gone
,
sir
,
"
resumed
Pancks
,
"
and
it
did
go
,
though
I
dribbled
it
out
like
so
much
blood
,
I
had
taken
Mr
Rugg
into
the
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
proposed
to
borrow
of
Mr
Rugg
(
or
of
Miss
Rugg
;
it
's
the
same
thing
;
she
made
a
little
money
by
a
speculation
in
the
Common
Pleas
once
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
lent
it
at
ten
,
and
thought
that
pretty
high
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Rugg
's
a
red
-
haired
man
,
sir
,
and
gets
his
hair
cut
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
crown
of
his
hat
,
it
's
high
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
brim
of
his
hat
,
it
's
narrow
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
's
no
more
benevolence
bubbling
out
of
him
,
than
out
of
a
ninepin
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
own
recompense
for
all
this
,
Mr
Pancks
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
ought
to
be
a
large
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mistrust
getting
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
no
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
I
owed
you
one
on
that
score
;
now
I
have
paid
it
.
 
<EOS>
Money
out
of
pocket
made
good
,
time
fairly
allowed
for
,
and
Mr
Rugg
's
bill
settled
,
a
thousand
pounds
would
be
a
fortune
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
That
matter
I
place
in
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
authorize
you
now
to
break
all
this
to
the
family
in
any
way
you
think
best
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Amy
Dorrit
will
be
with
Mrs
Finching
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
sooner
done
the
better
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
be
done
too
soon
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
conversation
took
place
in
Clennam
's
bed
-
room
,
while
he
was
yet
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
For
Mr
Pancks
had
knocked
up
the
house
and
made
his
way
in
,
very
early
in
the
morning
;
and
,
without
once
sitting
down
or
standing
still
,
had
delivered
himself
of
the
whole
of
his
details
(
illustrated
with
a
variety
of
documents
)
at
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
He
now
said
he
would
"
go
and
look
up
Mr
Rugg
'
,
from
whom
his
excited
state
of
mind
appeared
to
require
another
back
;
and
bundling
up
his
papers
,
and
exchanging
one
more
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
with
Clennam
,
he
went
at
full
speed
down
-
stairs
,
and
steamed
off
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
,
of
course
,
resolved
to
go
direct
to
Mr
Casby
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
dressed
and
got
out
so
quickly
that
he
found
himself
at
the
corner
of
the
patriarchal
street
nearly
an
hour
before
her
time
;
but
he
was
not
sorry
to
have
the
opportunity
of
calming
himself
with
a
leisurely
walk
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
returned
to
the
street
,
and
had
knocked
at
the
bright
brass
knocker
,
he
was
informed
that
she
had
come
,
and
was
shown
up
-
stairs
to
Flora
's
breakfast
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
not
there
herself
,
but
Flora
was
,
and
testified
the
greatest
amazement
at
seeing
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Arthur
---
Doyce
and
Clennam
!
"
cried
that
lady
,
"
who
would
have
ever
thought
of
seeing
such
a
sight
as
this
and
pray
excuse
a
wrapper
for
upon
my
word
<EOS>
I
really
never
and
a
faded
check
too
which
is
worse
<EOS>
but
our
little
friend
is
making
me
a
<EOS>
,
not
that
I
need
mind
mentioning
it
to
you
for
you
must
know
that
there
are
such
things
a
skirt
,
and
having
arranged
that
a
trying
on
should
take
place
after
breakfast
is
the
reason
though
I
wish
not
so
badly
starched
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
make
an
apology
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
for
so
early
and
abrupt
a
visit
;
but
you
will
excuse
it
when
I
tell
you
the
cause
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
times
for
ever
fled
Arthur
,
"
returned
Mrs
Finching
,
"
pray
excuse
me
Doyce
and
Clennam
infinitely
more
correct
and
though
unquestionably
distant
still
"
tis
distance
lends
enchantment
to
the
view
,
at
least
I
do
n't
mean
that
<EOS>
and
if
I
did
I
suppose
it
would
depend
considerably
on
the
nature
of
the
view
,
but
I
'm
running
on
again
<EOS>
and
you
put
it
all
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
glanced
at
him
tenderly
,
and
resumed
:
   
"
<EOS>
In
times
for
ever
fled
I
was
going
to
say
it
would
have
sounded
strange
indeed
for
Arthur
Clennam
---
Doyce
and
Clennam
naturally
quite
different
---
to
make
apologies
for
coming
here
at
any
time
,
but
that
is
past
and
what
is
past
can
never
be
recalled
except
in
his
own
case
as
poor
Mr
F
said
when
he
was
in
spirits
Cucumber
and
therefore
never
ate
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
making
the
tea
when
Arthur
came
in
,
and
now
hastily
finished
that
operation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
she
said
,
all
mystery
and
whisper
,
as
she
shut
down
the
tea
-
pot
lid
,
"
is
sitting
prosingly
breaking
his
new
laid
egg
in
the
back
parlour
over
the
City
article
exactly
like
the
Woodpecker
Tapping
and
need
never
know
that
you
are
here
,
and
our
little
friend
<EOS>
you
are
well
aware
may
be
fully
trusted
when
she
comes
down
from
cutting
out
on
the
large
table
overhead
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
then
told
her
,
in
the
fewest
words
,
that
it
was
their
little
friend
he
came
to
see
;
and
what
he
had
to
announce
to
their
little
friend
.
 
<EOS>
At
which
astounding
intelligence
,
Flora
clasped
her
hands
,
fell
into
a
tremble
,
and
shed
tears
of
sympathy
and
pleasure
,
like
the
good
-
natured
creature
she
really
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
goodness
sake
let
me
get
out
of
the
way
first
,
"
said
Flora
,
putting
her
hands
to
her
ears
and
moving
towards
the
door
,
"
or
I
know
I
shall
go
off
dead
and
screaming
and
make
everybody
worse
,
and
<EOS>
the
dear
little
thing
only
this
morning
looking
so
nice
and
neat
and
good
and
<EOS>
yet
so
poor
and
<EOS>
now
a
fortune
is
she
really
and
deserves
it
too
!
 
<EOS>
and
might
I
mention
it
to
Mr
F
's
Aunt
Arthur
not
Doyce
and
Clennam
for
this
once
or
if
objectionable
not
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
nodded
his
free
permission
,
since
Flora
shut
out
all
verbal
communication
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
nodded
in
return
to
thank
him
,
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
's
step
was
already
on
the
stairs
,
and
in
another
moment
she
was
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Do
what
he
could
to
compose
his
face
,
he
could
not
convey
so
much
of
an
ordinary
expression
into
it
,
but
that
the
moment
she
saw
it
she
dropped
her
work
,
and
cried
,
"
Mr
Clennam
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
,
no
misfortune
has
happened
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
tell
you
something
,
but
it
is
a
piece
of
great
good
-
fortune
.
"
<EOS>
"
Good
-
fortune
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wonderful
fortune
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
stood
in
a
window
,
and
her
eyes
,
full
of
light
,
were
fixed
upon
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
an
arm
about
her
,
seeing
her
likely
to
sink
down
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
a
hand
upon
that
arm
,
partly
to
rest
upon
it
,
and
partly
so
to
preserve
their
relative
positions
as
that
her
intent
look
at
him
should
be
shaken
by
no
change
of
attitude
in
either
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Her
lips
seemed
to
repeat
"
Wonderful
fortune
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
repeated
it
again
,
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Little
Dorrit
!
 
<EOS>
Your
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
ice
of
the
pale
face
broke
at
the
word
,
and
little
lights
and
shoots
of
expression
passed
all
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
expressions
of
pain
.
 
<EOS>
Her
breath
was
faint
and
hurried
.
 
<EOS>
Her
heart
beat
fast
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
clasped
the
little
figure
closer
,
but
he
saw
that
the
eyes
appealed
to
him
not
to
be
moved
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
father
can
be
free
within
this
week
.
 
<EOS>
He
does
not
know
it
;
we
must
go
to
him
from
here
,
to
tell
him
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
will
be
free
within
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
will
be
free
within
a
few
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
we
must
go
to
him
from
here
,
to
tell
him
of
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
That
brought
her
back
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
closing
,
but
they
opened
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
all
the
good
-
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
all
the
wonderful
good
-
fortune
,
my
dear
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
Her
lips
shaped
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
father
will
be
no
beggar
when
he
is
free
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
want
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
more
?
 
<EOS>
Remember
!
 
<EOS>
He
knows
nothing
of
it
;
we
must
go
to
him
,
from
here
,
to
tell
him
of
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
entreat
him
for
a
little
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
her
in
his
arm
,
and
,
after
a
pause
,
bent
down
his
ear
to
listen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ask
me
to
go
on
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
a
rich
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
rich
man
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
sum
of
money
is
waiting
to
be
paid
over
to
him
as
his
inheritance
;
you
are
all
henceforth
very
wealthy
.
 
<EOS>
Bravest
and
best
of
children
,
I
thank
Heaven
that
you
are
rewarded
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
kissed
her
,
she
turned
her
head
towards
his
shoulder
,
and
raised
her
arm
towards
his
neck
;
cried
out
"
Father
!
 
<EOS>
Father
!
<EOS>
Father
!
"
and
swooned
away
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
which
Flora
returned
to
take
care
of
her
,
and
hovered
about
her
on
a
sofa
,
intermingling
kind
offices
and
incoherent
scraps
of
conversation
in
a
manner
so
confounding
,
that
whether
she
pressed
the
Marshalsea
to
take
a
spoonful
of
unclaimed
dividends
,
for
it
would
do
her
good
;
or
whether
she
congratulated
Little
Dorrit
's
father
on
coming
into
possession
of
a
hundred
thousand
smelling
-
bottles
;
or
whether
she
explained
that
she
put
seventy
-
five
thousand
drops
of
spirits
of
lavender
on
fifty
thousand
pounds
of
lump
sugar
,
and
that
she
entreated
Little
Dorrit
to
take
that
gentle
restorative
;
or
whether
she
bathed
the
foreheads
of
Doyce
and
Clennam
in
vinegar
,
and
gave
the
late
Mr
F
more
air
;
no
one
with
any
sense
of
responsibility
could
have
undertaken
to
decide
.
<EOS>
A
tributary
stream
of
confusion
,
moreover
,
poured
in
from
an
adjoining
bedroom
,
where
Mr
F
's
Aunt
appeared
,
from
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
to
be
in
a
horizontal
posture
,
awaiting
her
breakfast
;
and
from
which
bower
that
inexorable
lady
snapped
off
short
taunts
,
whenever
she
could
get
a
hearing
,
as
,
"
Do
n't
believe
it
's
his
doing
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
He
need
n't
take
no
credit
to
himself
for
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
It
'll
be
long
enough
<EOS>
,
I
expect
,
afore
he
'll
give
up
any
of
his
own
money
!
"
<EOS>
all
designed
to
disparage
Clennam
's
share
in
the
discovery
,
and
to
relieve
those
inveterate
feelings
with
which
Mr
F
's
Aunt
regarded
him
.
   
<EOS>
But
Little
Dorrit
's
solicitude
to
get
to
her
father
,
and
to
carry
the
joyful
tidings
to
him
,
and
not
to
leave
him
in
his
jail
a
moment
with
this
happiness
in
store
for
him
and
still
unknown
to
him
,
did
more
for
her
speedy
restoration
than
all
the
skill
and
attention
on
earth
could
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
to
my
dear
father
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
come
and
tell
my
dear
father
!
"
<EOS>
were
the
first
words
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
,
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
of
nothing
but
him
,
thought
of
nothing
but
him
.
 
<EOS>
Kneeling
down
and
pouring
out
her
thankfulness
with
uplifted
hands
,
her
thanks
were
for
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
Flora
's
tenderness
was
quite
overcome
by
this
,
and
she
launched
out
among
the
cups
and
saucers
into
a
wonderful
flow
of
tears
and
speech
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
"
she
sobbed
,
"
I
never
was
so
cut
up
since
your
mama
and
my
papa
not
Doyce
and
Clennam
for
this
once
but
give
the
precious
little
thing
a
cup
of
tea
and
make
her
put
it
to
her
lips
at
least
pray
Arthur
do
,
not
even
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
last
illness
for
that
was
of
another
kind
and
gout
is
not
a
child
's
affection
though
very
painful
for
all
parties
and
Mr
F
<EOS>
a
martyr
with
his
leg
upon
a
rest
and
the
wine
trade
in
itself
inflammatory
for
they
will
do
it
more
or
less
among
themselves
and
who
can
wonder
,
it
seems
like
a
dream
I
am
sure
to
think
of
nothing
at
all
this
morning
and
now
Mines
of
money
is
it
really
,
but
you
must
know
my
darling
love
because
you
never
will
be
strong
enough
to
tell
him
all
about
it
upon
teaspoons
,
might
n't
it
be
even
best
to
try
the
directions
of
my
own
medical
man
for
though
the
flavour
is
anything
but
<EOS>
agreeable
still
I
force
myself
to
do
it
as
a
prescription
and
find
the
benefit
,
you
'd
rather
<EOS>
not
why
no
<EOS>
my
dear
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
still
I
do
it
as
a
duty
,
everybody
will
congratulate
you
some
in
earnest
and
some
not
and
many
will
congratulate
you
with
all
their
hearts
but
none
more
<EOS>
so
I
do
assure
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
own
<EOS>
I
do
myself
though
sensible
of
blundering
and
being
stupid
,
and
will
be
judged
by
Arthur
not
Doyce
and
Clennam
for
this
once
so
good
-
bye
darling
and
God
bless
you
<EOS>
and
may
you
be
very
happy
and
excuse
the
liberty
,
<EOS>
vowing
that
the
dress
shall
never
be
finished
by
anybody
else
but
shall
be
laid
by
for
a
keepsake
just
as
it
is
and
called
Little
Dorrit
though
why
that
strangest
of
denominations
at
any
time
I
never
did
myself
and
now
I
never
shall
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
Flora
,
in
taking
leave
of
her
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
thanked
her
,
and
embraced
her
,
over
and
over
again
;
and
finally
came
out
of
the
house
with
Clennam
,
and
took
coach
for
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
strangely
unreal
ride
through
the
old
squalid
streets
,
with
a
sensation
of
being
raised
out
of
them
into
an
airy
world
of
wealth
and
grandeur
.
 
<EOS>
When
Arthur
told
her
that
she
would
soon
ride
in
her
own
carriage
through
very
different
scenes
,
when
all
the
familiar
experiences
would
have
vanished
away
,
she
looked
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
he
substituted
her
father
for
herself
,
and
told
her
how
he
would
ride
in
his
carriage
,
and
how
great
and
grand
he
would
be
,
her
tears
of
joy
and
innocent
pride
fell
fast
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
that
the
happiness
her
mind
could
realise
was
all
shining
upon
him
,
Arthur
kept
that
single
figure
before
her
;
and
so
they
rode
brightly
through
the
poor
streets
in
the
prison
neighbourhood
to
carry
him
the
great
news
.
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
Chivery
,
who
was
on
duty
,
admitted
them
into
the
Lodge
,
he
saw
something
in
their
faces
which
filled
him
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
He
stood
looking
after
them
,
when
they
hurried
into
the
prison
,
as
though
he
perceived
that
they
had
come
back
accompanied
by
a
ghost
a
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
Collegians
whom
they
passed
,
looked
after
them
too
,
and
presently
joining
Mr
Chivery
,
formed
a
little
group
on
the
Lodge
steps
,
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
which
there
spontaneously
originated
a
whisper
that
the
Father
was
going
to
get
his
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
Within
a
few
minutes
,
it
was
heard
in
the
remotest
room
in
the
College
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
opened
the
door
from
without
,
and
they
both
entered
.
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
in
his
old
grey
gown
and
his
old
black
cap
,
in
the
sunlight
by
the
window
,
reading
his
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
His
glasses
were
in
his
hand
,
and
he
had
just
looked
round
;
surprised
at
first
,
no
doubt
,
by
her
step
upon
the
stairs
,
not
expecting
her
until
night
;
surprised
again
,
by
seeing
Arthur
Clennam
in
her
company
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
came
in
,
the
same
unwonted
look
in
both
of
them
which
had
already
caught
attention
in
the
yard
below
,
struck
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
rise
or
speak
,
but
laid
down
his
glasses
and
his
newspaper
on
the
table
beside
him
,
and
looked
at
them
with
his
mouth
a
little
open
and
his
lips
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
When
Arthur
put
out
his
hand
,
he
touched
it
,
but
not
with
his
usual
state
;
and
then
he
turned
to
his
daughter
,
who
had
sat
down
close
beside
him
with
her
hands
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
looked
attentively
in
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Father
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
made
so
happy
this
morning
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
made
so
happy
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
Mr
Clennam
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
brought
me
such
joyful
and
wonderful
intelligence
about
you
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
with
his
great
kindness
and
gentleness
,
prepared
me
for
it
,
father
---
prepared
me
for
it
,
father
<EOS>
---
I
think
I
could
not
have
borne
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
agitation
was
exceedingly
great
,
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
suddenly
to
his
heart
,
and
looked
at
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Compose
yourself
,
sir
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
and
take
a
little
time
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
To
think
of
the
brightest
and
most
fortunate
accidents
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
all
heard
of
great
surprises
of
joy
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
at
an
end
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
rare
,
but
not
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
?
 
<EOS>
Not
at
an
end
?
 
<EOS>
Not
at
an
end
for
---
<EOS>
"
He
touched
himself
upon
the
breast
,
instead
of
saying
"
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
surprise
,
"
he
asked
,
keeping
his
left
hand
over
his
heart
,
and
there
stopping
in
his
speech
,
while
with
his
right
hand
he
put
his
glasses
exactly
level
on
the
table
:
"
what
such
surprise
can
be
in
store
for
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
answer
with
another
question
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
what
surprise
would
be
the
most
unlooked
for
and
the
most
acceptable
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
be
afraid
to
imagine
it
,
or
to
say
what
it
would
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
steadfastly
at
Clennam
,
and
,
so
looking
at
him
,
seemed
to
change
into
a
very
old
haggard
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
was
bright
upon
the
wall
beyond
the
window
,
and
on
the
spikes
at
top
.
 
<EOS>
He
slowly
stretched
out
the
hand
that
had
been
upon
his
heart
,
and
pointed
at
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
down
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
remained
in
the
same
attitude
,
looking
steadfastly
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
in
its
place
,
"
said
Clennam
,
slowly
and
distinctly
,
"
are
the
means
to
possess
and
enjoy
the
utmost
that
they
have
so
long
shut
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
there
is
not
the
smallest
doubt
that
within
a
few
days
you
will
be
free
,
and
highly
prosperous
.
 
<EOS>
I
congratulate
you
with
all
my
soul
on
this
change
of
fortune
,
and
on
the
happy
future
into
which
you
are
soon
to
carry
the
treasure
you
have
been
blest
with
here
---
the
best
of
all
the
riches
you
can
have
elsewhere
---
the
treasure
at
your
side
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
he
pressed
his
hand
and
released
it
;
and
his
daughter
,
laying
her
face
against
his
,
encircled
him
in
the
hour
of
his
prosperity
with
her
arms
,
as
she
had
in
the
long
years
of
his
adversity
<EOS>
encircled
him
with
her
love
and
toil
and
truth
;
and
poured
out
her
full
heart
in
gratitude
,
hope
,
joy
,
blissful
ecstasy
,
and
all
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
him
as
I
never
saw
him
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
see
my
dear
love
,
with
the
dark
cloud
cleared
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
see
him
,
as
my
poor
mother
saw
him
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
dear
,
<EOS>
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
O
father
,
father
!
<EOS>
O
thank
God
,
thank
God
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
yielded
himself
to
her
kisses
and
caresses
,
but
did
not
return
them
,
except
that
he
put
an
arm
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
<EOS>
did
he
say
one
word
.
 
<EOS>
His
steadfast
look
was
now
divided
between
her
and
Clennam
,
and
he
began
to
shake
as
if
he
were
very
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Explaining
to
Little
Dorrit
that
he
would
run
to
the
coffee
-
house
for
a
bottle
of
wine
<EOS>
,
Arthur
fetched
it
with
all
the
haste
he
could
use
.
 
<EOS>
While
it
was
being
brought
from
the
cellar
to
the
bar
,
a
number
of
excited
people
asked
him
what
had
happened
;
when
he
hurriedly
informed
them
that
Mr
Dorrit
had
succeeded
to
a
fortune
.
   
<EOS>
On
coming
back
with
the
wine
in
his
hand
,
he
found
that
she
had
placed
her
father
in
his
easy
chair
,
and
had
loosened
his
shirt
and
neckcloth
.
 
<EOS>
They
filled
a
tumbler
with
wine
,
and
held
it
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
swallowed
a
little
,
he
took
the
glass
himself
and
emptied
it
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
that
,
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
cried
,
with
his
handkerchief
before
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
After
this
had
lasted
a
while
Clennam
thought
it
a
good
season
for
diverting
his
attention
from
the
main
surprise
,
by
relating
its
details
.
 
<EOS>
Slowly
,
therefore
,
and
in
a
quiet
tone
of
voice
,
he
explained
them
as
best
he
could
,
and
enlarged
on
the
nature
of
Pancks
's
service
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
---
ha
---
he
shall
be
handsomely
recompensed
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Father
,
starting
up
and
moving
hurriedly
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Assure
yourself
,
Mr
Clennam
,
that
everybody
concerned
shall
be
---
ha
---
shall
be
nobly
rewarded
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
,
my
dear
sir
,
shall
say
that
he
has
an
unsatisfied
claim
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
repay
the
---
hum
---
the
advances
I
have
had
from
you
,
sir
,
with
peculiar
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
to
be
informed
at
your
earliest
convenience
,
what
advances
you
have
made
my
son
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
no
purpose
in
going
about
the
room
,
but
he
was
not
still
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Everybody
,
"
he
said
,
"
shall
be
remembered
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
away
from
here
in
anybody
's
debt
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
people
who
have
been
---

well
behaved
towards
myself
and
my
family

shall
be
rewarded

<EOS>
Chivery
shall
be
rewarded
.
 
<EOS>
Young
John
shall
be
rewarded
.
 
<EOS>
I
particularly
wish
,
and
intend
,
to
act
munificently
,
Mr
Clennam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
,
"
said
Arthur
,
laying
his
purse
on
the
table
,
"
to
supply
any
present
contingencies
,
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
best
to
bring
a
sum
of
money
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
accept
with
readiness
,
at
the
present
moment
,
what
I
could
not
an
hour
ago
have
conscientiously
taken
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
you
for
the
temporary
accommodation
.
<EOS>
Exceedingly
temporary
,
but
well
timed
---
well
timed
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
hand
had
closed
upon
the
money
,
and
he
carried
it
about
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
so
kind
,
sir
,
as
to
add
the
amount
to
those
former
advances
to
which
I
have
already
referred
;
being
careful
,
if
you
please
,
not
to
omit
advances
made
to
my
son
.
 
<EOS>
A
mere
verbal
statement
of
the
gross
amount
is
all
I
shall
---
ha
---
all
I
shall
require
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
eye
fell
upon
his
daughter
at
this
point
,
and
he
stopped
for
a
moment
to
kiss
her
,
and
to
pat
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
necessary
to
find
a
milliner
,
my
love
,
and
to
make
a
speedy
and
complete
change
in
your
very
plain
dress

Something

be
done
with
Maggy
too

at
present

barely
respectable

And

And
my
brother

your
uncle
---
poor
soul

I
trust
this
will
rouse
him
<EOS>
---
messengers
must
be
despatched
to
fetch
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
be
informed
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
break
it
to
them
cautiously
,
but
they
must
be
informed
directly
.
 
<EOS>
We
owe
it
as
a
duty
to
them
and
to
ourselves
,
from
this
moment
,
not
to
let
them
---
<EOS>
hum

<EOS>
not
to
let
them
do
anything
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
intimation
he
had
ever
given
,
that
he
was
privy
to
the
fact
that
they
did
something
for
a
livelihood
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
still
jogging
about
the
room
,
with
the
purse
clutched
in
his
hand
,
when
a
great
cheering
arose
in
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
news
has
spread
already
,
"
said
Clennam
,
looking
down
from
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
show
yourself
to
them
,
Mr
Dorrit

<EOS>
They
are
very
earnest
,
and
they
evidently
wish

I

I

<EOS>
Amy
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
he
said
,
jogging
about
in
a
more
feverish
flutter
than
before
,
"
to
have
made
some
change
in
my
dress
first
,
and
to
have
bought
a
---
hum
---
a
watch
and
chain
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
it
must
be
done
as
it
is
,
it
---

it
must
be
done

<EOS>
Fasten
the
collar
of
my
shirt
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
would
you
oblige
me
---
hum

with
a
blue
neckcloth
you
will
find
in
that
drawer
at
your
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
Button
<EOS>
my
coat
across
at
the
chest
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
It
looks
---
ha
---
it
looks
broader
,
buttoned
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
his
trembling
hand
he
pushed
his
grey
hair
up
,
and
then
,
taking
Clennam
and
his
daughter
for
supporters
,
appeared
at
the
window
leaning
on
an
arm
of
each
.
 
<EOS>
The
Collegians
cheered
him
very
heartily
,
and
he
kissed
his
hand
to
them
with
great
urbanity
and
protection
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
withdrew
into
the
room
again
,
he
said
"
Poor
creatures
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
tone
of
much
pity
for
their
miserable
condition
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
deeply
anxious
that
he
should
lie
down
to
compose
himself
.
 
<EOS>
On
Arthur
's
speaking
to
her
of
his
going
to
inform
Pancks
that
he
might
now
appear
as
soon
as
he
would
,
and
pursue
the
joyful
business
to
its
close
,
she
entreated
him
in
a
whisper
to
stay
with
her
until
her
father
should
be
quite
calm
and
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
He
needed
no
second
entreaty
;
and
she
prepared
her
father
's
bed
,
and
begged
him
to
lie
down
.
 
<EOS>
For
another
half
-
hour
or
more
he
would
be
persuaded
to
do
nothing
but
go
about
the
room
,
discussing
with
himself
the
probabilities
for
and
against
the
Marshal
's
allowing
the
whole
of
the
prisoners
to
go
to
the
windows
of
the
official
residence
which
commanded
the
street
,
to
see
himself
and
family
depart
for
ever
in
a
carriage
---
which
,
he
said
,
he
thought
would
be
a
Sight
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
gradually
he
began
to
droop
and
tire
,
and
at
last
stretched
himself
upon
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
She
took
her
faithful
place
beside
him
,
fanning
him
and
cooling
his
forehead
;
and
he
seemed
to
be
falling
asleep
(
always
with
the
money
in
his
hand
)
,
when
he
unexpectedly
sat
up
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
to
understand
,
my
dear
sir
,
<EOS>
that
I
could
---
ha
---
could
pass
through
the
Lodge
at
this
moment
,
and
---
hum
---
take
a
walk
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
was
the
unwilling
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
certain
forms
to
be
completed
;
and
although
your
detention
here
is
now
in
itself
a
form
,
I
fear
it
is
one
that
for
a
little
longer
has
to
be
observed
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
he
shed
tears
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
but
a
few
hours
,
sir
,
"
Clennam
cheerfully
urged
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
few
hours
,
sir
,
"
he
returned
in
a
sudden
passion
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
talk
very
easily
of
hours
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
How
long
do
you
suppose
,
sir
,
that
an
hour
is
to
a
man
who
is
choking
for
want
of
air
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
his
last
demonstration
for
that
time
;
as
,
after
shedding
some
more
tears
and
querulously
complaining
that
he
could
n't
breathe
,
he
slowly
fell
into
a
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
had
abundant
occupation
for
his
thoughts
,
as
he
sat
in
the
quiet
room
watching
the
father
on
his
bed
,
and
the
daughter
fanning
his
face
.
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
had
been
thinking
too
.
 
<EOS>
After
softly
putting
his
grey
hair
aside
,
and
touching
his
forehead
with
her
lips
,
she
looked
towards
Arthur
,
who
came
nearer
to
her
,
and
pursued
in
a
low
whisper
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
will
he
pay
all
his
debts
before
he
leaves
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
All
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
the
debts
for
which
he
had
been
imprisoned
here
,
all
my
life
and
longer
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
of
uncertainty
and
remonstrance
in
her
look
;
something
that
was
not
all
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
He
wondered
to
detect
it
,
and
said
:
   
"
You
are
glad
that
he
should
do
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Little
Dorrit
,
wistfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
?
 
<EOS>
Most
heartily
glad
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
know
I
ought
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
are
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
hard
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
that
he
should
have
lost
so
many
years
and
suffered
so
much
,
and
at
last
pay
all
the
debts
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
hard
that
he
should
pay
in
life
and
money
both
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
---
"
Clennam
was
beginning
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
know
I
am
wrong
,
"
she
pleaded
timidly
,
"
do
n't
think
any
worse
of
me
;
it
has
grown
up
with
me
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
prison
,
which
could
spoil
so
many
things
,
had
tainted
Little
Dorrit
's
mind
no
more
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
Engendered
as
the
confusion
was
<EOS>
,
in
compassion
for
the
poor
prisoner
,
her
father
,
it
was
the
first
speck
Clennam
had
ever
seen
,
it
was
the
last
speck
Clennam
ever
saw
,
of
the
prison
atmosphere
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
He
thought
this
,
and
forebore
to
say
another
word
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
thought
,
her
purity
and
goodness
came
before
him
in
their
brightest
light
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
spot
made
them
the
more
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
Worn
out
with
her
own
emotions
,
and
yielding
to
the
silence
of
the
room
,
her
hand
slowly
slackened
and
failed
in
its
fanning
movement
,
and
her
head
dropped
down
on
the
pillow
at
her
father
's
side
.
<EOS>
Clennam
rose
softly
,
opened
and
closed
the
door
without
a
sound
,
and
passed
from
the
prison
,
carrying
the
quiet
with
him
into
the
turbulent
streets
.

Chapter
36
.
<EOS>
The
Marshalsea
becomes
an
Orphan
 
<EOS>
And
now
the
day
arrived
when
Mr
Dorrit
and
his
family
were
to
leave
the
prison
for
ever
,
and
the
stones
of
its
much
-
trodden
pavement
were
to
know
them
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
The
interval
had
been
short
,
but
he
had
greatly
complained
of
its
length
,
and
had
been
imperious
with
Mr
Rugg
touching
the
delay
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
high
with
Mr
Rugg
,
and
had
threatened
to
employ
some
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
requested
Mr
Rugg
not
to
presume
upon
the
place
in
which
he
found
him
,
but
to
do
his
duty
,
sir
,
and
to
do
it
with
promptitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
told
Mr
Rugg
that
he
knew
what
lawyers
and
agents
were
,
and
that
he
would
not
submit
to
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
gentleman
's
humbly
representing
that
he
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
,
Miss
Fanny
was
very
short
with
him
;
desiring
to
know
what
less
he
could
do
,
when
he
had
been
told
a
dozen
times
that
money
was
no
object
,
and
expressing
her
suspicion
that
he
forgot
whom
he
talked
to
.
   
<EOS>
Towards
the
Marshal
,
who
was
a
Marshal
of
many
years
'
standing
,
and
with
whom
he
had
never
had
any
previous
difference
,
Mr
Dorrit
comported
himself
with
severity
.
 
<EOS>
That
officer
,
on
personally
tendering
his
congratulations
,
offered
the
free
use
of
two
rooms
in
his
house
for
Mr
Dorrit
's
occupation
until
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
thanked
him
at
the
moment
,
and
replied
that
he
would
think
of
it
;
but
the
Marshal
was
no
sooner
gone
than
he
sat
down
and
wrote
him
a
cutting
note
,
in
which
he
remarked
that
he
had
never
on
any
former
occasion
had
the
honour
of
receiving
his
congratulations
(
which
was
true
,
though
indeed
there
had
not
been
anything
particular
to
congratulate
him
upon
)
,
and
that
he
begged
,
on
behalf
of
himself
and
family
,
to
repudiate
the
Marshal
's
offer
,
with
all
those
thanks
which
its
disinterested
character
and
its
perfect
independence
of
all
worldly
considerations
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
Although
his
brother
showed
so
dim
a
glimmering
of
interest
in
their
altered
fortunes
that
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
he
understood
them
<EOS>
,
Mr
Dorrit
caused
him
to
be
measured
for
new
raiment
by
the
hosiers
,
tailors
,
hatters
,
and
bootmakers
whom
he
called
in
for
himself
;
and
ordered
that
his
old
clothes
should
be
taken
from
him
and
burned
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
and
Mr
Tip
required
no
direction
in
making
an
appearance
of
great
fashion
and
elegance
;
and
the
three
passed
this
interval
together
at
the
best
hotel
in
the
neighbourhood
---
though
truly
,
as
Miss
Fanny
said
,
the
best
was
very
indifferent
.
 
<EOS>
In
connection
with
that
establishment
,
Mr
Tip
hired
a
cabriolet
,
horse
,
and
groom
,
a
very
neat
turn
out
,
which
was
usually
to
be
observed
for
two
or
three
hours
at
a
time
gracing
the
Borough
High
Street
,
outside
the
Marshalsea
court
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
A
modest
little
hired
chariot
and
pair
was
also
frequently
to
be
seen
there
;
in
alighting
from
and
entering
which
vehicle
,
Miss
Fanny
fluttered
the
Marshal
's
daughters
by
the
display
of
inaccessible
bonnets
.
   
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
business
was
transacted
in
this
short
period
.
<EOS>
Among
other
items
,
Messrs
Peddle
and
Pool
,
solicitors
,
of
Monument
Yard
,
were
instructed
by
their
client
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
to
address
a
letter
to
Mr
Arthur
Clennam
,
enclosing
the
sum
of
twenty
-
four
pounds
nine
shillings
and
eightpence
,
being
the
amount
of
principal
and
interest
computed
at
the
rate
of
five
per
cent
.
 
<EOS>
per
annum
,
in
which
their
client
believed
himself
to
be
indebted
to
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
In
making
this
communication
and
remittance
,
Messrs
Peddle
and
Pool
were
further
instructed
by
their
client
to
remind
Mr
Clennam
that
the
favour
of
the
advance
now
repaid
(
including
gate
-
fees
)
had
not
been
asked
of
him
,
and
to
inform
him
that
it
would
not
have
been
accepted
if
it
had
been
openly
proffered
in
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
With
which
they
requested
a
stamped
receipt
,
and
remained
his
obedient
servants
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
business
had
likewise
to
be
done
,
within
the
so
-
soon
-
to
-
be
-
orphaned
Marshalsea
,
by
Mr
Dorrit
so
long
its
Father
,
chiefly
arising
out
of
applications
made
to
him
by
Collegians
for
small
sums
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
To
these
he
responded
with
the
greatest
liberality
,
and
with
no
lack
of
formality
;
always
first
writing
to
appoint
a
time
at
which
the
applicant
might
wait
upon
him
in
his
room
,
and
then
receiving
him
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
accumulation
of
documents
,
and
accompanying
his
donation
(
for
he
said
in
every
such
case
,
"
it
is
a
donation
,
not
a
loan
"
)
with
a
great
deal
of
good
counsel
:
to
the
effect
that
he
,
the
expiring
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
hoped
to
be
long
remembered
,
as
an
example
that
a
man
might
preserve
his
own
and
the
general
respect
even
there
.
   
<EOS>
The
Collegians
were
not
envious
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
that
they
had
a
personal
and
traditional
regard
for
a
Collegian
of
so
many
years
'
standing
,
the
event
was
creditable
to
the
College
,
and
made
it
famous
in
the
newspapers
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
more
of
them
thought
,
too
,
than
were
quite
aware
of
it
,
that
the
thing
might
in
the
lottery
of
chances
have
happened
to
themselves
,
or
that
something
of
the
sort
might
yet
happen
to
themselves
some
day
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
A
few
were
low
at
the
thought
of
being
left
behind
,
and
being
left
poor
;
but
even
these
did
not
grudge
the
family
their
brilliant
reverse
.
 
<EOS>
There
might
have
been
much
more
envy
in
politer
places
.
<EOS>
It
seems
probable
that
mediocrity
of
fortune
would
have
been
disposed
to
be
less
magnanimous
than
the
Collegians
,
who
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
---
from
the
pawnbroker
's
hand
to
the
day
's
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
They
got
up
an
address
to
him
,
which
they
presented
in
a
neat
frame
and
glass
(
though
it
was
not
afterwards
displayed
in
the
family
mansion
or
preserved
among
the
family
papers
)
;
and
to
which
he
returned
a
gracious
answer
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
document
he
assured
them
,
in
a
Royal
manner
,
that
he
received
the
profession
of
their
attachment
with
a
full
conviction
of
its
sincerity
;
and
again
generally
exhorted
them
to
follow
his
example
---
which
,
at
least
in
so
far
as
coming
into
a
great
property
was
concerned
<EOS>
,
there
is
no
doubt
they
would
have
gladly
imitated
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
same
occasion
of
inviting
them
to
a
comprehensive
entertainment
,
to
be
given
to
the
whole
College
in
the
yard
,
and
at
which
he
signified
he
would
have
the
honour
of
taking
a
parting
glass
to
the
health
and
happiness
of
all
those
whom
he
was
about
to
leave
behind
.
   
<EOS>
He
did
not
in
person
dine
at
this
public
repast
<EOS>
(
it
took
place
at
two
in
the
afternoon
,
and
his
dinners
now
came
in
from
the
hotel
at
six
)
,
but
his
son
was
so
good
as
to
take
the
head
of
the
principal
table
,
and
to
be
very
free
and
engaging
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
went
about
among
the
company
,
and
took
notice
of
individuals
,
and
saw
that
the
viands
were
of
the
quality
he
had
ordered
,
and
that
all
were
served
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
he
was
like
a
baron
of
the
olden
time
in
a
rare
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
conclusion
of
the
repast
,
he
pledged
his
guests
in
a
bumper
of
old
Madeira
;
and
told
them
that
he
hoped
they
had
enjoyed
themselves
,
and
what
was
more
,
that
they
would
enjoy
themselves
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
;
that
he
wished
them
well
;
and
that
he
bade
them
welcome
.
   
<EOS>
His
health
being
drunk
with
acclamations
,
he
was
not
so
baronial
after
all
but
<EOS>
that
in
trying
to
return
thanks
he
broke
down
,
in
the
manner
of
a
mere
serf
with
a
heart
in
his
breast
,
and
wept
before
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
great
success
,
which
he
supposed
to
be
a
failure
,
he
gave
them
"
Mr
Chivery
and
his
brother
officers
;
"
whom
he
had
beforehand
presented
with
ten
pounds
each
,
and
who
were
all
in
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chivery
spoke
to
the
toast
,
saying
,
What
you
undertake
to
lock
up
,
lock
up
;
but
remember
that
you
are
,
in
the
words
of
the
fettered
African
,
a
man
and
a
brother
ever
.
 
<EOS>
The
list
of
toasts
disposed
of
<EOS>
,
Mr
Dorrit
urbanely
went
through
the
motions
of
playing
a
game
of
skittles
with
the
Collegian
who
was
the
next
oldest
inhabitant
to
himself
;
and
left
the
tenantry
to
their
diversions
.
   
<EOS>
But
all
these
occurrences
preceded
the
final
day
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
the
day
arrived
when
he
and
his
family
were
to
leave
the
prison
for
ever
,
and
when
the
stones
of
its
much
-
trodden
pavement
were
to
know
them
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
Noon
was
the
hour
appointed
for
the
departure
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
approached
,
there
was
not
a
Collegian
within
doors
,
nor
a
turnkey
absent
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
class
of
gentlemen
appeared
in
their
Sunday
clothes
,
and
the
greater
part
of
the
Collegians
were
brightened
up
as
much
as
circumstances
allowed
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
flags
were
even
displayed
,
and
the
children
put
on
odds
and
ends
of
ribbon
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
himself
,
at
this
trying
time
,
preserved
a
serious
but
graceful
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
Much
of
his
great
attention
was
given
to
his
brother
,
as
to
whose
bearing
on
the
great
occasion
he
felt
anxious
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Frederick
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
you
will
give
me
your
arm
we
will
pass
among
our
friends
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
right
that
we
should
go
out
arm
in
arm
,
my
dear
Frederick
.
<EOS>
"

Frederick

"
Yes

And
if

my

if
you
could
,
without
putting
any
great
constraint
upon
yourself
,
throw
a
little
(
pray
excuse
me
,

,
a
little
Polish
into
your
usual
demeanour

William

said
the

,
shaking
his
head
,
"
it
's

I
do

But
,
my
dear
fellow

"
returned
William
,
"
for
that
very
reason
,
if
for
no
other
,
you
must
positively
try
to
rouse
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
have
forgotten
you
must
now
begin
to
recall

my

Frederick

<EOS>

<EOS>
Your

Frederick

<EOS>
He
looked
first
at
his
own
figure
,
and
then
at
his
brother
's
,
and
then
,
drawing
a
long
breath
,
cried
,
"
Hah
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
.
"
<EOS>
"
Your

my

,
is
now
a
fine
one

<EOS>
Your
position
,
as
my
brother
,
is
a
very
fine
one
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
know
that
it
belongs
to
your
conscientious
nature
to
try
to
become
worthy
of
it
,
my
dear
Frederick
,
and
to
try
to
adorn
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
no
discredit
to
it
,
but
to
adorn
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
William
,
"
said
the
other
weakly
,
and
with
a
sigh
,
"
I
will
do
anything
you
wish
,
my
brother
,
provided
it
lies
in
my
power

<EOS>
Pray
be
so
kind
as
to
recollect
what
a
limited
power
mine
is

<EOS>
What
would
you
wish
me
to
do
to

day

Say
what

only
say
what
it
is

<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Frederick
,
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
worth
troubling
so
good
a
heart
as
yours
with

<EOS>
"
Pray
trouble
it

returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
finds
it
no
trouble
,
William
,
to
do
anything
it
can
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
William
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
and
murmured
with
august
satisfaction
,
"
Blessings
on
your
attachment
,
my
poor
dear
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
Then
he
said
aloud
,
"
Well
,
my
dear
Frederick
,
if
you
will
only
try
,
as
we
walk
out
,
to
show
that
you
are
alive
to
the
occasion
 
---
that
you
think
about
it

"
What
would
you
advise
me
to
think
about
it
?

returned
his
submissive
brother
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
my
dear
Frederick
,
how
can
I
answer
you

<EOS>
I
can
only
say
what

in
leaving
these
good
people

I
think
myself

<EOS>
"
That
's
it

cried
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
will
help
me

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
find
that
I
think
,
my
dear
Frederick
,
and
with
mixed
emotions
in
which
a
softened
compassion
predominates

What

they
do

returned
his

I

Twelve
o'clock
having
just
struck
,
and
the
carriage
being
reported
ready
in
the
outer
court
-
yard
,
the
brothers
proceeded
down

stairs
arm
-
in
-
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
(
once
Tip
)
,
and
his
sister
Fanny
followed
,
also
arm
-
in
-
arm
;
Mr
Plornish
and
Maggy
,
to
whom
had
been
entrusted
the
removal
of
such
of
the
family
effects
as
were
considered
worth
removing
,
followed
,
bearing
bundles
and
burdens
to
be
packed
in
a
cart
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
yard
,
were
the
Collegians
and
turnkeys
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
yard
,
were
Mr
Pancks
and
Mr
Rugg
,
come
to
see
the
last
touch
given
to
their
work
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
yard
,
was
Young
John
making
a
new
epitaph
for
himself
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
dying
of
a
broken
heart
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
yard
,
was
the
Patriarchal
Casby
,
looking
so
tremendously
benevolent
that
many
enthusiastic
Collegians
grasped
him
fervently
by
the
hand
,
and
the
wives
and
female
relatives
of
many
more
Collegians
kissed
his
hand
,
nothing
doubting
that
he
had
done
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
yard
,
was
the
man
with
the
shadowy
grievance
respecting
the
Fund
which
the
Marshal
embezzled
,
who
had
got
up
at
five
in
the
morning
to
complete
the
copying
of
a
perfectly
unintelligible
history
of
that
transaction
,
which
he
had
committed
to
Mr
Dorrit
's
care
,
as
a
document
of
the
last
importance
,
calculated
to
stun
the
Government
and
effect
the
Marshal
's
downfall
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
yard
,
was
the
insolvent
whose
utmost
energies
were
always
set
on
getting
into
debt
,
who
broke
into
prison
with
as
much
pains
as
other
men
have
broken
out
of
it
,
and
who
was
always
being
cleared
and
complimented
;
while
the
insolvent
at
his
elbow
---
a
mere
little
,
snivelling
,
striving
tradesman
,
half
dead
of
anxious
efforts
to
keep
out
of
debt
---
found
it
a
hard
matter
,
indeed
,
to
get
a
Commissioner
to
release
him
with
much
reproof
and
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
yard
,
was
the
man
of
many
children
and
many
burdens
,
whose
failure
astonished
everybody
;
in
the
yard
,
was
the
man
of
no
children
and
large
resources
,
whose
failure
astonished
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
were
the
people
who
were
always
going
out
to
-
morrow
,
and
always
putting
it
off
;
there
,
were
the
people
who
had
come
in
yesterday
,
and
who
were
much
more
jealous
and
resentful
of
this
freak
of
fortune
than
the
seasoned
birds
.
<EOS>
There
,
were
some
who
,
in
pure
meanness
of
spirit
,
cringed
and
bowed
before
the
enriched
Collegian
and
his
family
;
there
,
were
others
who
did
so
really
because
their
eyes
,
accustomed
to
the
gloom
of
their
imprisonment
and
poverty
,
could
not
support
the
light
of
such
bright
sunshine
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
were
many
whose
shillings
had
gone
into
his
pocket
to
buy
him
meat
and
drink
;
but
none
who
were
now
obtrusively
<EOS>
Hail
fellow
well
met
!
 
<EOS>
with
him
,
on
the
strength
of
that
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
rather
to
be
remarked
of
the
caged
birds
,
that
they
were
a
little
shy
of
the
bird
about
to
be
so
grandly
free
,
and
that
they
had
a
tendency
to
withdraw
themselves
towards
the
bars
,
and
seem
a
little
fluttered
as
he
passed
.
   
<EOS>
Through
these
spectators
the
little
procession
,
headed
by
the
two
brothers
,
moved
slowly
to
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
yielding
to
the
vast
speculation
how
the
poor
creatures
were
to
get
on
without
him
,
was
great
,
and
sad
,
but
not
absorbed
.
 
<EOS>
He
patted
children
on
the
head
like
Sir
Roger
de
Coverley
going
to
church
,
he
spoke
to
people
in
the
background
by
their
Christian
names
,
he
condescended
to
all
present
,
and
seemed
for
their
consolation
to
walk
encircled
by
the
legend
in
golden
characters
,
"
Be
comforted
,
my
people
!
 
<EOS>
Bear
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
last
three
honest
cheers
announced
that
he
had
passed
the
gate
,
and
that
the
Marshalsea
was
an
orphan
.
 
<EOS>
Before
they
had
ceased
to
ring
in
the
echoes
of
the
prison
walls
,
the
family
had
got
into
their
carriage
,
and
the
attendant
had
the
steps
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
and
not
before
,
"
Good
Gracious
!
"
cried
Miss
Fanny
all
at
once
,
"
<EOS>
Where
's
Amy
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
father
had
thought
she
was
with
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
had
thought
she
was
"
somewhere
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
had
all
trusted
to
finding
her
,
as
they
had
always
done
,
quietly
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
moment
.
 
<EOS>
This
going
away
was
perhaps
the
very
first
action
of
their
joint
lives
that
they
had
got
through
without
her
.
   
<EOS>
A
minute
might
have
been
consumed
in
the
ascertaining
of
these
points
,
when
Miss
Fanny
,
who
,
from
her
seat
in
the
carriage
,
commanded
the
long
narrow
passage
leading
to
the
Lodge
,
flushed
indignantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
do
say
,
Pa
,
"
cried
she
,
"
that
this
is
disgraceful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
disgraceful
,
Fanny
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
say
,
"
she
repeated
,
"
this
is
perfectly
infamous
!
 
<EOS>
Really
almost
enough
,
even
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
to
make
one
wish
one
was
dead
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
that
child
Amy
,
in
her
ugly
old
shabby
dress
,
which
she
was
so
obstinate
about
,
Pa
,
which
I
over
and
over
again
begged
and
prayed
her
to
change
,
and
which
she
over
and
over
again
objected
to
,
and
promised
to
change
to
-
day
,
saying
she
wished
to
wear
it
as
long
as
ever
she
remained
in
there
with
you
---
which
was
absolutely
romantic
nonsense
of
the
lowest
kind
---
here
<EOS>
is
that
child
Amy
disgracing
us
to
the
last
moment
and
at
the
last
moment
,
by
being
carried
out
in
that
dress
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
by
that
Mr
Clennam
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
offence
was
proved
,
as
she
delivered
the
indictment
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
appeared
at
the
carriage
-
door
,
bearing
the
little
insensible
figure
in
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
forgotten
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
pity
not
free
from
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ran
up
to
her
room
(
which
Mr
Chivery
showed
me
)
and
found
the
door
open
,
and
that
she
had
fainted
on
the
floor
,
dear
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
have
gone
to
change
her
dress
,
and
to
have
sunk
down
overpowered
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
the
cheering
,
or
it
may
have
happened
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
of
this
poor
cold
hand

Miss
Dorrit

Do
n't
let
it
fall

<EOS>
"
Thank

returned
Miss
Dorrit
,
bursting
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
know
what
to
do

if
you

give
me
leave

The

getting
between
Clennam

door
,
with
a
sharp

bundled
up

In

autumn
of
the
year

Darkness

Night
were
creeping
up
to
the
highest
ridges

It
was
vintage
time
in

on
the
Swiss
side
of
the
Pass
of
the
Great
Saint
Bernard
,
and
along
the
banks

the
Lake

The
air
there
was
charged
with
the
scent
of
gathered
grapes

<EOS>
Baskets

troughs

tubs
of
grapes
stood
in
the
dim
village
doorways

stopped
the
steep

narrow
village
streets

had
been
carrying
all
day
along
the
roads
and
lanes
.
 
<EOS>
Grapes
,
split
and
crushed
under
foot
,
lay
about
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
carried
in
a
sling
by
the
laden
peasant
woman
toiling
home
,
was
quieted
with
picked
-
up
grapes
;
the
idiot
sunning
his
big
goitre
under
the
leaves
of
the
wooden
chalet
by
the
way
to
the
Waterfall
,
sat
Munching
grapes
;
the
breath
of
the
cows
and
goats
was
redolent
of
leaves
and
stalks
of
grapes
;
the
company
in
every
little
cabaret
were
eating
,
drinking
,
talking
grapes
.
 
<EOS>
A
pity
that
no
ripe
touch
of
this
generous
abundance
could
be
given
to
the
thin
,
hard
,
stony
wine
,
which
after
all
was
made
from
the
grapes
!
   
<EOS>
The
air
had
been
warm
and
transparent
through
the
whole
of
the
bright
day
.
 
<EOS>
Shining
metal
spires
and
church
-
roofs
,
distant
and
rarely
seen
,
had
sparkled
in
the
view
;
and
the
snowy
mountain
-
tops
had
been
so
clear
that
unaccustomed
eyes
,
cancelling
the
intervening
country
,
and
slighting
their
rugged
heights
for
something
fabulous
,
would
have
measured
them
as
within
a
few
hours
easy
reach
.
 
<EOS>
Mountain
-
peaks
of
great
celebrity
in
the
valleys
,
whence
no
trace
of
their
existence
was
visible
sometimes
for
months
together
,
had
been
since
morning
plain
and
near
in
the
blue
sky
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
when
it
was
dark
below
,
though
they
seemed
solemnly
to
recede
,
like
spectres
who
were
going
to
vanish
,
as
the
red
dye
of
the
sunset
faded
out
of
them
and
left
them
coldly
white
,
they
were
yet
distinctly
defined
in
their
loneliness
above
the
mists
and
shadows
.
<EOS>
Seen
from
these
solitudes
,
and
from
the
Pass
of
the
Great
Saint
Bernard
,
which
was
one
of
them
,
the
ascending
Night
came
up
the
mountain
like
a
rising
water
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
at
last
rose
to
the
walls
of
the
convent
of
the
Great
Saint
Bernard
,
it
was
as
if
that
weather
-
beaten
structure
were
another
Ark
,
and
floated
on
the
shadowy
waves
.
   
<EOS>
Darkness
,
outstripping
some
visitors
on
mules
,
had
risen
thus
to
the
rough
convent
walls
,
when
those
travellers
were
yet
climbing
the
mountain
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
heat
of
the
glowing
day
when
they
had
stopped
to
drink
at
the
streams
of
melted
ice
and
snow
,
was
changed
to
the
searching
cold
of
the
frosty
rarefied
night
air
at
a
great
height
,
so
the
fresh
beauty
of
the
lower
journey
had
yielded
to
barrenness
and
desolation
.
 
<EOS>
A
craggy
track
,
up
which
the
mules
in
single
file
scrambled
and
turned
from
block
to
block
,
as
though
they
were
ascending
the
broken
staircase
of
a
gigantic
ruin
,
was
their
way
now
.
 
<EOS>
No
trees
were
to
be
seen
,
nor
any
vegetable
growth
save
a
poor
brown
scrubby
moss
,
freezing
in
the
chinks
of
rock
.
 
<EOS>
Blackened
skeleton
arms
of
wood
by
the
wayside
pointed
upward
to
the
convent
as
if
the
ghosts
of
former
travellers
overwhelmed
by
the
snow
haunted
the
scene
of
their
distress
.
 
<EOS>
Icicle
-
hung
caves
and
cellars
built
for
refuges
from
sudden
storms
,
were
like
so
many
whispers
of
the
perils
of
the
place
;
never
-
resting
wreaths
and
mazes
of
mist
wandered
about
,
hunted
by
a
moaning
wind
;
and
snow
,
the
besetting
danger
of
the
mountain
,
against
which
all
its
defences
were
taken
,
drifted
sharply
down
.
   
<EOS>
The
file
of
mules
,
jaded
by
their
day
's
work
,
turned
and
wound
slowly
up
the
deep
ascent
;
the
foremost
led
by
a
guide
on
foot
,
in
his
broad
-
brimmed
hat
and
round
jacket
,
carrying
a
mountain
staff
or
two
upon
his
shoulder
,
with
whom
another
guide
conversed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
speaking
among
the
string
of
riders
.
 
<EOS>
The
sharp
cold
,
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
,
and
a
new
sensation
of
a
catching
in
the
breath
,
partly
as
if
they
had
just
emerged
from
very
clear
crisp
water
,
and
partly
as
if
they
had
been
sobbing
,
kept
them
silent
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
light
on
the
summit
of
the
rocky
staircase
gleamed
through
the
snow
and
mist
.
 
<EOS>
The
guides
called
to
the
mules
,
the
mules
pricked
up
their
drooping
heads
,
the
travellers
'
tongues
were
loosened
,
and
in
a
sudden
burst
of
slipping
,
climbing
,
jingling
,
clinking
,
and
talking
,
they
arrived
at
the
convent
door
.
   
<EOS>
Other
mules
had
arrived
not
long
before
,
some
with
peasant
riders
and
some
with
goods
,
and
had
trodden
the
snow
about
the
door
into
a
pool
of
mud
.
 
<EOS>
Riding
-
saddles
and
bridles
,
pack

saddles
and
strings
of
bells
,
mules
and
men
,
lanterns
,
torches
,
sacks
,
provender
,
barrels
,
cheeses
,
kegs
of
honey
and
butter
,
straw
bundles
and
packages
of
many
shapes
,
were
crowded
confusedly
together
in
this
thawed
quagmire
and
about
the
steps
.
 
<EOS>
Up
here
in
the
clouds
,
everything
was
seen
through
cloud
,
and
seemed
dissolving
into
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
The
breath
of
the
men
was
cloud
,
the
breath
of
the
mules
was
cloud
,
the
lights
were
encircled
by
cloud
,
speakers
close
at
hand
were
not
seen
for
cloud
,
though
their
voices
and
all
other
sounds
were
surprisingly
clear
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
cloudy
line
of
mules
hastily
tied
to
rings
in
the
wall
,
one
would
bite
another
,
or
kick
another
,
and
then
the
whole
mist
would
be
disturbed
:
with
men
diving
into
it
,
and
cries
of
men
and
beasts
coming
out
of
it
,
and
no
bystander
discerning
what
was
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
,
the
great
stable
of
the
convent
,
occupying
the
basement
story
and
entered
by
the
basement
door
,
outside
which
all
the
disorder
was
,
poured
forth
its
contribution
of
cloud
,
as
if
the
whole
rugged
edifice
were
filled
with
nothing
else
,
and
would
collapse
as
soon
as
it
had
emptied
itself
,
leaving
the
snow
to
fall
upon
the
bare
mountain
summit
.
   
<EOS>
While
all
this
noise
and
hurry
were
rife
among
the
living
travellers
,
there
,
too
,
silently
assembled
in
a
grated
house
half
-
a
-
dozen
paces
removed
,
with
the
same
cloud
enfolding
them
and
the
same
snow
flakes
drifting
in
upon
them
,
were
the
dead
travellers
found
upon
the
mountain
.
 
<EOS>
The
mother
,
storm
-
belated
many
winters
ago
,
still
standing
in
the
corner
with
her
baby
at
her
breast
;
the
man
who
had
frozen
with
his
arm
raised
to
his
mouth
in
fear
or
hunger
,
still
pressing
it
with
his
dry
lips
after
years
and
years
.
<EOS>
An
awful
company
,
mysteriously
come
together
!
 
<EOS>
A
wild
destiny
for
that
mother
to
have
foreseen
!
 
<EOS>
"
Surrounded
by
so
many
and
such
companions
upon
whom
I
never
looked
,
and
never
shall
look
,
I
and
my
child
will
dwell
together
inseparable
,
on
the
Great
Saint
Bernard
,
outlasting
generations
who
will
come
to
see
us
,
and
will
never
know
our
name
,
or
one
word
of
our
story
but
the
end
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
living
travellers
thought
little
or
nothing
of
the
dead
just
then
.
 
<EOS>
They
thought
much
more
of
alighting
at
the
convent
door
,
and
warming
themselves
at
the
convent
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Disengaged
from
the
turmoil
,
which
was
already
calming
down
as
the
crowd
of
mules
began
to
be
bestowed
in
the
stable
,
they
hurried
shivering
up
the
steps
and
into
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
smell
within
,
coming
up
from
the
floor
,
of
tethered
beasts
,
like
the
smell
of
a
menagerie
of
wild
animals
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
strong
arched
galleries
within
,
huge
stone
piers
,
great
staircases
,
and
thick
walls
pierced
with
small
sunken
windows
---
fortifications
against
the
mountain
storms
,
as
if
they
had
been
human
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
gloomy
vaulted
sleeping
-
rooms
within
,
intensely
cold
,
but
clean
and
hospitably
prepared
for
guests
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
there
was
a
parlour
for
guests
to
sit
in
and
sup
<EOS>
in
,
where
a
table
was
already
laid
,
and
where
a
blazing
fire
shone
red
and
high
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
room
,
after
having
had
their
quarters
for
the
night
allotted
to
them
by
two
young
Fathers
,
the
travellers
presently
drew
round
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
in
three
parties
;
of
whom
the
first
,
as
the
most
numerous
and
important
,
was
the
slowest
,
and
had
been
overtaken
by
one
of
the
others
on
the
way
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
an
elderly
lady
,
two
grey
-
haired
gentlemen
,
two
young
ladies
,
and
their
brother
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
attended
(
not
to
mention
four
guides
)
,
by
a
courier
,
two
footmen
,
and
two
waiting
-
maids
:
which
strong
body
of
inconvenience
was
accommodated
elsewhere
under
the
same
roof
.
<EOS>
The
party
that
had
overtaken
them
,
and
followed
in
their
train
,
consisted
of
only
three
members
:
one
lady
and
two
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
The
third
party
,
which
had
ascended
from
the
valley
on
the
Italian
side
of
the
Pass
,
and
had
arrived
first
,
were
four
in
number
:
a
plethoric
,
hungry
,
and
silent
German
tutor
in
spectacles
,
on
a
tour
with
three
young
men
,
his
pupils
,
all
plethoric
,
hungry
,
and
silent
,
and
all
in
spectacles
.
   
<EOS>
These
three
groups
sat
round
the
fire
eyeing
each
other
drily
,
and
waiting
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
Only
one
among
them
,
one
of
the
gentlemen
belonging
to
the
party
of
three
,
made
advances
towards
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Throwing
out
his
lines
for
the
Chief
of
the
important
tribe
,
while
addressing
himself
to
his
own
companions
,
he
remarked
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
included
all
the
company
if
they
chose
to
be
included
,
that
it
had
been
a
long
day
,
and
that
he
felt
for
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
feared
one
of
the
young
ladies
was
not
a
strong
or
accustomed
traveller
,
and
had
been
over
-
fatigued
two
or
three
hours
ago
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
observed
,
from
his
station
in
the
rear
,
that
she
sat
her
mule
as
if
she
were
exhausted
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
,
twice
or
thrice
afterwards
,
done
himself
the
honour
of
inquiring
of
one
of
the
guides
,
when
he
fell
behind
,
how
the
lady
did
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
been
enchanted
to
learn
that
she
had
recovered
her
spirits
,
and
that
it
had
been
but
a
passing
discomfort
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
trusted
(
by
this
time
he
had
secured
the
eyes
of
the
Chief
,
and
addressed
him
)
<EOS>
he
might
be
permitted
to
express
his
hope
that
she
was
now
none
the
worse
,
and
that
she
would
not
regret
having
made
the
journey
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
,
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
Chief
,
"
is
quite
restored
,
and
has
been
greatly
interested
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
New
to
mountains
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
insinuating
traveller
.
   
<EOS>
"
New
to
---
ha
---
to
mountains
,
"
said
the
Chief
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
familiar
with
them
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
the
insinuating
traveller
assumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
---
hum
---
tolerably
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
Not
of
late
years
.
 
<EOS>
Not
of
late
years
,
"
replied
the
Chief
,
with
a
flourish
of
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
The
insinuating
traveller
,
acknowledging
the
flourish
with
an
inclination
of
his
head
,
passed
from
the
Chief
to
the
second
young
lady
,
who
had
not
yet
been
referred
to
otherwise
than
as
one
of
the
ladies
in
whose
behalf
he
felt
so
sensitive
an
interest
.
   
<EOS>
He
hoped
she
was
not
incommoded
by
the
fatigues
of
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Incommoded
,
certainly
,
"
returned
the
young
lady
,
"
but
not
tired
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
insinuating
traveller
complimented
her
on
the
justice
of
the
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
what
he
had
meant
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Every
lady
must
doubtless
be
incommoded
by
having
to
do
with
that
proverbially
unaccommodating
animal
,
the
mule
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
had
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
young
lady
,
who
was
rather
reserved
and
haughty
,
"
to
leave
the
carriages
and
fourgon
at
Martigny
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
impossibility
of
bringing
anything
that
one
wants
to
this
inaccessible
place
,
and
the
necessity
of
leaving
every
comfort
behind
,
is
not
convenient
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
savage
place
indeed
,
"
said
the
insinuating
traveller
.
   
<EOS>
The
elderly
lady
,
who
was
a
model
of
accurate
dressing
,
and
whose
manner
was
perfect
,
considered
as
a
piece
of
machinery
,
here
interposed
a
remark
in
a
low
soft
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
like
other
inconvenient
places
,
"
she
observed
,
"
it
must
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
place
much
spoken
of
,
it
is
necessary
to
see
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
objection
to
seeing
it
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
Mrs
General
,
"
returned
the
other
,
carelessly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
,
madam
,
"
said
the
insinuating
traveller
,
"
have
visited
this
spot
before
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Mrs
General
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
here
before
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
commend
you
,
my
dear
,
"
to
the
former
young
lady
,
"
to
shade
your
face
from
the
hot
wood
,
after
exposure
to
the
mountain
air
and
snow
.
 
<EOS>
You
,
too
,
my
dear
,
"
to
the
other
and
younger
lady
,
who
immediately
did
so
;
while
the
former
merely
said
,
"
Thank
you
,
Mrs
General
,
I
am
Perfectly
comfortable
,
and
prefer
remaining
as
I
am

<EOS>
The
brother
,
who
had
left
his
chair
to
open
a
piano
that
stood
in
the
room
,
and
who
had
whistled
into
it
and
shut
it
up
again
,
now
came
strolling
back
to
the
fire
with
his
glass
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
the
very
fullest
and
completest
travelling
trim
.
 
<EOS>
The
world
seemed
hardly
large
enough
to
yield
him
an
amount
of
travel
proportionate
to
his
equipment
.
   
<EOS>
"
These
fellows
are
an
immense
time
with
supper

he
drawled
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder

they
'll
give
us

anybody
any
idea
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
roast
man
,
I
believe
,
"
replied
the
voice
of
the
second
gentleman
of
the
party
of
three
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
 
<EOS>
What
d'ye
mean
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
as
you
are
not
to
be
served
for
the
general
supper
,
perhaps
you
will
do
us
the
favour
of
not
cooking
yourself
at
the
general
fire
,
"
returned
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
who
was
standing
in
an
easy
attitude
on
the
hearth
,
cocking
his
glass
at
the
company
,
with
his
back
to
the
blaze
and
his
coat
tucked
under
his
arms
,
something
as
if
he
were
Of
the
Poultry
species
and
were
trussed
for
roasting
,
lost
countenance
at
this
reply
;
he
seemed
about
to
demand
further
explanation
,
when
it
was
discovered
---
through
all
eyes
turning
on
the
speaker
---
that
the
lady
with
him
,
who
was
young
and
beautiful
,
had
not
heard
what
had
passed
through
having
fainted
with
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
a
subdued
tone
,
"
I
had
best
carry
her
straight
to
her
room
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
call
to
some
one
to
bring
a
light
?
"
<EOS>
addressing
his
companion
,
"
and
to
show
the
way
?
 
<EOS>
In
this
strange
rambling
place
I
do
n't
know
that
I
could
find
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
let
me
call
my
maid
,
"
cried
the
taller
of
the
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
let
me
put
this
water
to
her
lips
,
"
said
the
shorter
,
who
had
not
spoken
yet
.
   
<EOS>
Each
doing
what
she
suggested
,
there
was
no
want
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
the
two
maids
came
in
(
escorted
by
the
courier
,
lest
any
one
should
strike
them
dumb
by
addressing
a
foreign
language
to
them
on
the
road
)
,
there
was
a
prospect
of
too
much
assistance
.
<EOS>
Seeing
this
,
and
saying
as
much
in
a
few
words
to
the
slighter
and
younger
of
the
two
ladies
,
the
gentleman
put
his
wife
's
arm
over
his
shoulder
,
lifted
her
up
,
and
carried
her
away
.
   
<EOS>
His
friend
,
being
left
alone
with
the
other
visitors
,
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
room
without
coming
to
the
fire
again
,
pulling
his
black
moustache
in
a
contemplative
manner
,
as
if
he
felt
himself
committed
to
the
late
retort
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
subject
of
it
was
breathing
injury
in
a
corner
,
the
Chief
loftily
addressed
this
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
friend
,
sir
,
"
said
he
,
"
is
---
ha
---
is
a
little
impatient
;
and
,
in
his
impatience
,
is
not
perhaps
fully
sensible
of
what
he
owes
to
---
hum
---
to
---
<EOS>
but
we
will
waive
that
,
we
will
waive
that
.
 
<EOS>
Your
friend
is
a
little
impatient
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
having
had
the
honour
of
making
that
gentleman
's
acquaintance
at
the
hotel
at
Geneva
,
where
we
and
much
good
company
met
some
time
ago
,
and
having
had
the
honour
of
exchanging
company
and
conversation
with
that
gentleman
on
several
subsequent
excursions
,
I
can
hear
nothing
---
<EOS>
no
,
not
even
from
one
of
your
appearance
and
station
,
sir
---
detrimental
to
that
gentleman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
no
danger
,
sir
,
of
hearing
any
such
thing
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
remarking
that
your
friend
has
shown
impatience
,
I
say
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
that
remark
,
because
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
my
son
,
being
by
birth
and
by
---
ha
---
by
education
a
---
hum
---
a
gentleman
,
would
have
readily
adapted
himself
to
any
obligingly
expressed
wish
on
the
subject
of
the
fire
being
equally
accessible
to
the
whole
of
the
present
circle
.
 
<EOS>
Which
,
in
principle
,
I
---
ha
---
for
all
are
---
hum
---
equal
on
these
occasions
---
I
consider
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
it
ends
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
your
son
's
obedient
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
son
to
receive
the
assurance
of
my
profound
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
sir
,
I
may
admit
,
freely
admit
,
that
my
friend
is
sometimes
of
a
sarcastic
temper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
lady
is
your
friend
's
wife
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
lady
is
my
friend
's
wife
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
handsome
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
she
is
peerless
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
still
in
the
first
year
of
their
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
still
partly
on
a
marriage
,
and
partly
on
an
artistic
,
tour
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
friend
is
an
artist
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
replied
by
kissing
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
,
and
wafting
the
kiss
the
length
of
his
arm
towards
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
As
who
should
say
,
I
devote
him
to
the
celestial
Powers
as
an
immortal
artist
!
   
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
a
man
of
family
,
"
he
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
connections
are
of
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
more
than
an
artist
:
he
is
highly
connected
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
,
in
effect
,
have
repudiated
his
connections
,
proudly
,
impatiently
,
<EOS>
sarcastically
(
I
make
the
concession
of
both
words
)
;
but
he
has
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sparks
that
have
been
struck
out
during
our
intercourse
have
shown
me
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
"
said
the
lofty
gentleman
,
with
the
air
of
finally
disposing
of
the
subject
,
"
that
the
lady
's
indisposition
may
be
only
temporary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
hope
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mere
fatigue
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
altogether
mere
fatigue
,
sir
,
for
her
mule
stumbled
to
-
day
,
and
she
fell
from
the
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
lightly
,
and
was
up
again
without
assistance
,
and
rode
from
us
laughing
;
but
she
complained
towards
evening
of
a
slight
bruise
in
the
side
.
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
of
it
more
than
once
,
as
we
followed
your
party
up
the
mountain
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
head
of
the
large
retinue
,
who
was
gracious
but
not
familiar
,
appeared
by
this
time
to
think
that
he
had
condescended
more
than
enough
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
no
more
,
and
there
was
silence
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
until
supper
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
With
the
supper
came
one
of
the
young
Fathers
<EOS>
(
there
seemed
to
be
no
old
Fathers
)
to
take
the
head
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
the
supper
of
an
ordinary
Swiss
hotel
,
and
good
red
wine
grown
by
the
convent
in
more
genial
air
was
not
wanting
.
 
<EOS>
The
artist
traveller
calmly
came
and
took
his
place
at
table
when
the
rest
sat
down
,
with
no
apparent
sense
upon
him
of
his
late
skirmish
with
the
completely
dressed
traveller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
he
inquired
of
the
host
,
over
his
soup
,
"
has
your
convent
many
of
its
famous
dogs
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
it
has
three
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
three
in
the
gallery
below
.
 
<EOS>
Doubtless
the
three
in
question
.
<EOS>
"
The
host
,
a
slender
,
bright
-
eyed
,
dark
young
man
of
polite
manners
,
whose
garment
was
a
black
gown
with
strips
of
white
crossed
over
it
like
braces
,
and
who
no
more
resembled
the
conventional
breed
of
Saint
Bernard
monks
than
he
resembled
the
conventional
breed
of
Saint
Bernard
dogs
,
replied
,
doubtless
those
were
the
three
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
"
said
the
artist
traveller
,
"
I
have
seen
one
of
them
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
possible
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
dog
sufficiently
well
known
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
might
have
easily
seen
him
in
the
valley
or
somewhere
on
the
lake
,
when
he
(
the
dog
)
had
gone
down
with
one
of
the
order
to
solicit
aid
for
the
convent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
is
done
in
its
regular
season
of
the
year
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
was
right
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
never
without
a
dog
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
is
very
important
.
"
<EOS>
Again
Monsieur
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
was
very
important
.
 
<EOS>
People
were
justly
interested
in
the
dog
.
 
<EOS>
As
one
of
the
dogs
celebrated
everywhere
,
Ma'amselle
would
observe
.
   
<EOS>
Ma'amselle
was
a
little
slow
to
observe
it
,
as
though
she
were
not
yet
well
accustomed
to
the
French
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
,
however
,
observed
it
for
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
him
if
he
has
saved
many
lives
?
"
<EOS>
said
,
in
his
native
English
,
the
young
man
who
had
been
put
out
of
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
The
host
needed
no
translation
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
He
promptly
replied
in
French
,
"
No
.
 
Not
this
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
the
same
gentleman
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
"
returned
the
host
composedly
,
"
give
him
the
opportunity
and
he
will
do
it
without
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
For
example
,
I
am
well
convinced
,
"
smiling
sedately
,
as
he
cut
up
the
dish
of
veal
to
be
handed
round
,
on
the
young
man
who
had
been
put
out
of
countenance
,
"
that
if
you
,
Monsieur
,
would
give
him
the
opportunity
,
he
would
hasten
with
great
ardour
to
fulfil
his
duty
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
artist
traveller
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
The
insinuating
traveller
(
who
evinced
a
provident
anxiety
to
get
his
full
share
of
the
supper
)
,
wiping
some
drops
of
wine
from
his
moustache
with
a
piece
of
bread
,
joined
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
becoming
late
in
the
year
,
my
Father
,
"
said
he
,
"
for
tourist
-
travellers
,
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
late
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
two
or
three
weeks
,
at
most
,
and
we
shall
be
left
to
the
winter
snows
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
then
,
"
said
the
insinuating
traveller
,
"
for
the
scratching
dogs
and
the
buried
children
,
according
to
the
pictures
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
"
said
the
host
,
not
quite
understanding
the
allusion
.
<EOS>
"
How
,
then
the
scratching
dogs
and
the
buried
children
according
to
the
pictures
?
"
   
The
artist
traveller
struck
in
again
before
an
answer
could
be
given
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
,
"
he
coldly
inquired
across
the
table
of
his
companion
,
"
that
none
but
smugglers
come
this
way
in
the
winter
or
can
have
any
possible
business
this
way
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Holy
blue
!
 
<EOS>
No
;
never
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
it
is
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
they
know
the
signs
of
the
weather
tolerably
well
,
they
do
n't
give
much
employment
to
the
dogs
---
who
have
consequently
died
out
rather
---
though
this
house
of
entertainment
is
conveniently
situated
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Their
young
families
,
I
am
told
,
they
usually
leave
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
grand
idea
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
artist
traveller
,
unexpectedly
rising
into
a
tone
of
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
sublime
idea
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
finest
idea
in
the
world
,
and
brings
tears
into
a
man
's
eyes
,
by
Jupiter
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
went
on
eating
his
veal
with
great
composure
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
enough
of
mocking
inconsistency
at
the
bottom
of
this
speech
to
make
it
rather
discordant
,
though
the
manner
was
refined
and
the
person
well
-
favoured
,
and
though
the
depreciatory
part
of
it
was
so
skilfully
thrown
off
as
to
be
very
difficult
for
one
not
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
English
language
to
understand
,
or
,
even
understanding
,
to
take
offence
at
:
<EOS>
so
simple
and
dispassionate
was
its
tone
.
 
<EOS>
After
finishing
his
veal
in
the
midst
of
silence
,
the
speaker
again
addressed
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
,
"
said
he
,
in
his
former
tone
,
"
at
this
gentleman
our
host
,
not
yet
in
the
prime
of
life
,
who
in
so
graceful
a
way
and
with
such
courtly
urbanity
and
modesty
presides
over
us
!
 
<EOS>
Manners
fit
for
a
crown
!
 
<EOS>
Dine
with
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
(
if
you
can
get
an
invitation
)
and
observe
the
contrast
.
 
<EOS>
This
dear
fellow
,
with
the
finest
cut
face
I
ever
saw
,
a
face
in
perfect
drawing
,
leaves
some
laborious
life
and
comes
up
here
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
many
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
,
for
no
other
purpose
on
earth
(
except
enjoying
himself
,
I
hope
,
in
a
capital
refectory
)
than
to
keep
an
hotel
for
idle
poor
devils
like
you
and
me
,
and
leave
the
bill
to
our
consciences
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
is
n't
it
a
beautiful
sacrifice
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
we
want
more
to
touch
us
?
 
<EOS>
Because
rescued
people
of
interesting
appearance
are
not
,
for
eight
or
nine
months
out
of
every
twelve
,
holding
on
here
<EOS>
round
the
necks
of
the
most
sagacious
of
dogs
carrying
wooden
bottles
,
shall
we
disparage
the
place
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
Bless
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
great
place
,
a
glorious
place
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
chest
of
the
grey
-
haired
gentleman
who
was
the
Chief
of
the
important
party
,
had
swelled
as
if
with
a
protest
against
his
being
numbered
among
poor
devils
.
 
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
the
artist
traveller
ceased
speaking
than
he
himself
spoke
with
great
dignity
,
as
having
it
incumbent
on
him
to
take
the
lead
in
most
places
,
and
having
deserted
that
duty
for
a
little
while
.
   
<EOS>
He
weightily
communicated
his
opinion
to
their
host
,
that
his
life
must
be
a
very
dreary
life
here
in
the
winter
.
   
<EOS>
The
host
allowed
to
Monsieur
that
it
was
a
little
monotonous
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
was
difficult
to
breathe
for
a
length
of
time
consecutively
.
<EOS>
The
cold
was
very
severe
.
 
<EOS>
One
needed
youth
and
strength
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
having
them
and
the
blessing
of
Heaven
---
   
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
was
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
confinement
,
"
said
the
grey
-
haired
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
many
days
,
even
in
bad
weather
,
when
it
was
possible
to
walk
about
outside
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
custom
to
beat
a
little
track
,
and
take
exercise
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
space
,
"
urged
the
grey
-
haired
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
small
.
 
<EOS>
So
---
ha
---
very
limited
.
"
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
would
recall
to
himself
that
there
were
the
refuges
to
visit
,
and
that
tracks
had
to
be
made
to
them
also
.
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
still
urged
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
the
space
was
so
---
ha
---
hum
---
so
very
contracted
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
that
,
it
was
always
the
same
,
always
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
With
a
deprecating
smile
,
the
host
gently
raised
and
gently
lowered
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
true
,
he
remarked
,
but
permit
him
to
say
that
almost
all
objects
had
their
various
points
of
view
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
and
<EOS>
he
did
not
see
this
poor
life
of
his
from
the
same
point
of
view
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
was
not
used
to
confinement
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
---
ha
---
yes
,
very
true
,
"
said
the
grey
-
haired
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
receive
quite
a
shock
from
the
force
of
the
argument
.
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
as
an
English
traveller
,
surrounded
by
all
means
of
travelling
pleasantly
;
doubtless
possessing
fortune
,
carriages
,
and
servants
---
   
"
Perfectly
,
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
Without
doubt
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
could
not
easily
place
himself
in
the
position
of
a
person
who
had
not
the
power
to
choose
,
I
will
go
here
to
-
morrow
,
or
there
next
day
;
I
will
pass
these
barriers
,
I
will
enlarge
those
bounds
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
could
not
realise
,
perhaps
,
how
the
mind
accommodated
itself
in
such
things
to
the
force
of
necessity
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
said
Monsieur
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
---
ha
---
not
pursue
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
You
are
---
hum
---
quite
accurate
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
say
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
supper
having
come
to
a
close
,
he
drew
his
chair
away
as
he
spoke
,
and
moved
back
to
his
former
place
by
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
very
cold
at
the
greater
part
of
the
table
,
the
other
guests
also
resumed
their
former
seats
by
the
fire
,
designing
to
toast
themselves
well
before
going
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
host
,
when
they
rose
from
the
table
,
bowed
to
all
present
,
wished
them
good
night
,
and
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
But
first
the
insinuating
traveller
had
asked
him
if
they
could
have
some
wine
made
hot
;
and
as
he
had
answered
Yes
,
and
had
presently
afterwards
sent
it
in
,
that
traveller
,
seated
in
the
centre
of
the
group
,
and
in
the
full
heat
of
the
fire
,
was
soon
engaged
in
serving
it
out
to
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
the
younger
of
the
two
young
ladies
,
who
had
been
silently
attentive
in
her
dark
corner
(
the
fire
-
light
was
the
chief
light
in
the
sombre
room
,
the
lamp
being
smoky
and
dull
)
to
what
had
been
said
of
the
absent
lady
,
glided
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
at
a
loss
which
way
to
turn
when
she
had
softly
closed
the
door
;
but
,
after
a
little
hesitation
among
the
sounding
passages
and
the
many
ways
,
came
to
a
room
in
a
corner
of
the
main
gallery
,
where
the
servants
were
at
their
supper
.
 
<EOS>
From
these
she
obtained
a
lamp
,
and
a
direction
to
the
lady
's
room
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
up
the
great
staircase
on
the
story
above
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
the
bare
white
walls
were
broken
by
an
iron
grate
,
and
she
thought
as
she
went
along
that
the
place
was
something
like
a
prison
.
 
<EOS>
The
arched
door
of
the
lady
's
room
,
or
cell
,
was
not
quite
shut
.
 
<EOS>
After
knocking
at
it
two
or
three
times
without
receiving
an
answer
,
she
pushed
it
gently
open
,
and
looked
in
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
lay
with
closed
eyes
on
the
outside
of
the
bed
,
protected
from
the
cold
by
the
blankets
and
wrappers
with
which
she
had
been
covered
when
she
revived
from
her
fainting
fit
.
 
<EOS>
A
dull
light
placed
in
the
deep
recess
of
the
window
,
made
little
impression
on
the
arched
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitor
timidly
stepped
to
the
bed
,
and
said
,
in
a
soft
whisper
,
"
Are
you
better
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
had
fallen
into
a
slumber
,
and
the
whisper
was
too
low
to
awake
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
visitor
,
standing
quite
still
,
looked
at
her
attentively
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
pretty
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
so
beautiful
a
face
.
 
<EOS>
O
how
unlike
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
curious
thing
to
say
,
but
it
had
some
hidden
meaning
,
for
it
filled
her
eyes
with
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
must
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
spoke
of
her
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
very
easily
be
wrong
on
any
other
subject
,
but
not
on
this
,
not
on
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
quiet
and
tender
hand
she
put
aside
a
straying
fold
of
the
sleeper
's
hair
,
and
then
touched
the
hand
that
lay
outside
the
covering
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
look
at
her
,
"
she
breathed
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
see
what
has
affected
him
so
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
not
withdrawn
her
hand
,
when
the
sleeper
opened
her
eyes
and
started
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
be
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
only
one
of
the
travellers
from
downstairs
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
ask
if
you
were
better
,
and
if
I
could
do
anything
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
already
been
so
kind
as
to
send
your
servants
to
my
assistance
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
<EOS>
I
;
that
was
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
better
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Much
better
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
only
a
slight
bruise
,
and
has
been
well
looked
to
,
and
is
almost
easy
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
me
giddy
and
faint
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
hurt
me
before
;
but
at
last
it
overpowered
me
all
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
"
May
I
stay
with
you
until
some
one
comes
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
like
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
,
for
it
is
lonely
here
;
but
I
am
afraid
you
will
feel
the
cold
too
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
cold
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
delicate
,
if
I
look
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
quickly
moved
one
of
the
two
rough
chairs
to
the
bedside
,
and
sat
down
.
<EOS>
The
other
as
quickly
moved
a
part
of
some
travelling
wrapper
from
herself
,
and
drew
it
over
her
,
so
that
her
arm
,
in
keeping
it
about
her
,
rested
on
her
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
so
much
the
air
of
a
kind
nurse
,
"
said
the
lady
,
smiling
on
her
,
"
that
you
seem
as
if
you
had
come
to
me
from
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
dreaming
of
home
when
I
woke
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
Of
my
old
home
,
I
mean
,
before
I
was
married
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
before
you
were
so
far
away
from
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
much
farther
away
from
it
than
this
;
but
then
I
took
the
best
part
of
it
with
me
,
and
missed
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
solitary
as
I
dropped
asleep
here
,
and
,
missing
it
a
little
,
wandered
back
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sorrowfully
affectionate
and
regretful
sound
in
her
voice
,
which
made
her
visitor
refrain
from
looking
at
her
for
the
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
curious
chance
which
at
last
brings
us
together
,
under
this
covering
in
which
you
have
wrapped
me
,
"
said
the
visitor
after
a
pause
;
"
for
do
you
know
,
I
think
I
have
been
looking
for
you
some
time
.
"
<EOS>
"
Looking
for
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
have
a
little
note
here
,
which
I
was
to
give
to
you
whenever
I
found
you
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
it
.
 
<EOS>
Unless
I
greatly
mistake
,
it
is
addressed
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
took
it
,
and
said
yes
,
and
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
visitor
watched
her
as
she
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
short
.
 
<EOS>
She
flushed
a
little
as
she
put
her
lips
to
her
visitor
's
cheek
,
and
pressed
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
dear
young
friend
to
whom
he
presents
me
,
may
be
a
comfort
to
me
at
some
time
,
he
says
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
truly
a
comfort
to
me
the
first
time
I
see
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
do
n't
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
hesitating
---
"
<EOS>
perhaps
you
do
n't
know
my
story
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
never
told
you
my
story
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
why
should
he
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
the
right
to
tell
it
myself
at
present
,
because
I
have
been
entreated
not
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
not
much
in
it
,
but
it
might
account
to
you
for
my
asking
you
not
to
say
anything
about
the
letter
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
saw
my
family
with
me
,
perhaps
?
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
<EOS>
---
I
only
say
this
to
you
---
are
a
little
proud
,
a
little
prejudiced
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
take
it
back
again
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
and
then
my
husband
is
sure
not
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
see
it
and
speak
of
it
,
otherwise
,
by
some
accident
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
put
it
in
your
bosom
again
,
to
be
certain
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
did
so
with
great
care
.
 
<EOS>
Her
small
,
slight
hand
was
still
upon
the
letter
,
when
they
heard
some
one
in
the
gallery
outside
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
promised
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
rising
,
"
that
I
would
write
to
him
after
seeing
you
(
I
could
hardly
fail
to
see
you
sooner
or
later
)
,
and
tell
him
if
you
were
well
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
better
say
you
were
well
and
happy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
Say
<EOS>
I
was
very
well
and
very
happy
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
I
thanked
him
affectionately
,
and
would
never
forget
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
you
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
we
are
sure
to
meet
again
before
very
long
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
Both
of
them
were
hurried
and
fluttered
as
they
exchanged
this
parting
,
and
as
the
visitor
came
out
of
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
expected
to
meet
the
lady
's
husband
approaching
it
;
but
the
person
in
the
gallery
was
not
he
:
it
was
the
traveller
who
had
wiped
the
wine
-
drops
from
his
moustache
with
the
piece
of
bread
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
heard
the
step
behind
him
,
he
turned
round
---
for
he
was
walking
away
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
His
politeness
,
which
was
extreme
,
would
not
allow
of
the
young
lady
's
lighting
herself
down
-
stairs
,
or
going
down
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
her
lamp
,
held
it
so
as
to
throw
the
best
light
on
the
stone
steps
,
and
followed
her
all
the
way
to
the
supper
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
down
,
not
easily
hiding
how
much
she
was
inclined
to
shrink
and
tremble
;
for
the
appearance
of
this
traveller
was
particularly
disagreeable
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
sat
in
her
quiet
corner
before
supper
imagining
what
he
would
have
been
in
the
scenes
and
places
within
her
experience
,
until
he
inspired
her
with
an
aversion
that
made
him
little
less
than
terrific
.
   
<EOS>
He
followed
her
down
with
his
smiling
politeness
,
followed
her
in
,
and
resumed
his
seat
in
the
best
place
in
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
There
with
the
wood
-
fire
,
which
was
beginning
to
burn
low
,
rising
and
falling
upon
him
in
the
dark
room
,
he
sat
with
his
legs
thrust
out
to
warm
,
drinking
the
hot
wine
down
to
the
lees
,
with
a
monstrous
shadow
imitating
him
on
the
wall
and
ceiling
.
   
<EOS>
The
tired
company
had
broken
up
,
and
all
the
rest
were
gone
to
bed
except
the
young
lady
's
father
,
who
dozed
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
The
traveller
had
been
at
the
pains
of
going
a
long
way
up
-
stairs
to
his
sleeping
-
room
to
fetch
his
pocket
-
flask
of
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
them
so
,
as
he
poured
its
contents
into
what
was
left
of
the
wine
,
and
drank
with
a
new
relish
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
sir

The
grey
-
haired
gentleman
had
roused
himself
,
and
was
preparing
to
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
He
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
also

said
the
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hope

have
the

my
compliments

on

dismal

<EOS>
The
gentleman
bowed
,
distantly
enough
,
and
said
he
was
obliged
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
poor
gentlemen
,
sir

"
said
the
traveller
,
pulling
his
moustache
dry
with
his
hand
,
for
he
had
dipped
it
in
the
wine
and
brandy
;
"
we
poor
gentlemen
do
not
travel
like
princes

the
courtesies

precious

They

<EOS>
said
the
traveller
,
rising
and
holding
the
door
open
,
as
the
gentleman
crossed
the
room
towards
it
with
his
arm
drawn
through
his
daughter

Good

<EOS>
As
he
kissed
his
hand
,
with
his
best
manner
and
his
daintiest
smile
,
the
young
lady
drew
a
little
nearer
to
her
father
,
and
passed
him
with
a
dread
of
touching
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
insinuating
traveller
,
whose
manner
shrunk
,

voice
dropped
when
he
was
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
If

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
One
would
think
the

<EOS>
Throwing
back
his
head
in
emptying
his
glass
,
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
the

lay
on

open

Mrs
General
 
<EOS>
It
is
indispensable
to
present
the
accomplished
lady
who
was
of
sufficient
importance
in
the
suite
of
the
Dorrit
Family
to
have
a
line
to
herself
in
the
Travellers
'
Book
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
was
the
daughter
of
a
clerical
dignitary
in
a
cathedral
town
,
where
she
had
led
the
fashion
until
she
was
as
near
forty
-
five
as
a
single
lady
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
A
stiff
commissariat
officer
of
sixty
,
famous
as
a
martinet
,
had
then
become
enamoured
of
the
gravity
with
which
she
drove
the
proprieties
four
-
in
-
hand
through
the
cathedral
town
society
,
and
had
solicited
to
be
taken
beside
her
on
the
box
of
the
cool
coach
of
ceremony
to
which
that
team
was
harnessed
.
 
<EOS>
His
proposal
of
marriage
being
accepted
by
the
lady
<EOS>
,
the
commissary
took
his
seat
behind
the
proprieties
with
great
decorum
,
and
Mrs
General
drove
until
the
commissary
died
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
their
united
journey
,
they
ran
over
several
people
who
came
in
the
way
of
the
proprieties
;
but
always
in
a
high
style
and
with
composure
.
   
<EOS>
The
commissary
having
been
buried
with
all
the
decorations
suitable
to
the
service
<EOS>
(
the
whole
team
of
proprieties
were
harnessed
to
his
hearse
,
and
they
all
had
feathers
and
black
velvet
housings
with
his
coat
of
arms
in
the
corner
)
,
Mrs
General
began
to
inquire
what
quantity
of
dust
and
ashes
was
deposited
at
the
bankers
'
.
 
<EOS>
It
then
transpired
that
the
commissary
had
so
far
stolen
a
march
on
Mrs
General
as
to
have
bought
himself
an
annuity
some
years
before
his
marriage
,
and
to
have
reserved
that
circumstance
in
mentioning
,
at
the
period
of
his
proposal
,
that
his
income
was
derived
from
the
interest
of
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
consequently
found
her
means
so
much
diminished
,
<EOS>
that
,
but
for
the
perfect
regulation
of
her
mind
,
she
might
have
felt
disposed
to
question
the
accuracy
of
that
portion
of
the
late
service
which
had
declared
that
the
commissary
could
take
nothing
away
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
affairs
it
occurred
to
Mrs
General
,
that
she
might
"
form
the
mind
,
"
and
eke
the
manners
of
some
young
lady
of
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
Or
,
that
she
might
harness
the
proprieties
to
the
carriage
of
some
rich
young
heiress
or
widow
,
and
become
at
once
the
driver
and
guard
of
such
vehicle
through
the
social
mazes
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
's
communication
of
this
idea
to
her
clerical
and
commissariat
connection
was
so
warmly
applauded
that
,
but
for
the
lady
's
undoubted
merit
,
it
might
have
appeared
as
though
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Testimonials
representing
Mrs
General
as
a
prodigy
of
piety
,
learning
,
virtue
,
and
gentility
,
were
lavishly
contributed
from
influential
quarters
;
and
one
venerable
archdeacon
even
shed
tears
in
recording
his
testimony
to
her
perfections
(
described
to
him
by
persons
on
whom
he
could
rely
)
,
though
he
had
never
had
the
honour
and
moral
gratification
of
setting
eyes
on
Mrs
General
in
all
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
delegated
on
her
mission
,
as
it
were
by
Church
and
State
,
Mrs
General
,
who
had
always
occupied
high
ground
,
felt
in
a
condition
to
keep
it
,
and
began
by
putting
herself
up
at
a
very
high
figure
.
<EOS>
An
interval
of
some
duration
elapsed
,
in
which
there
was
no
bid
for
Mrs
General
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
a
county
-
widower
,
with
a
daughter
of
fourteen
,
opened
negotiations
with
the
lady
;
and
as
it
was
a
part
either
of
the
native
dignity
or
of
the
artificial
policy
of
Mrs
General
(
<EOS>
but
certainly
one
or
the
other
)
to
comport
herself
as
if
she
were
much
more
sought
than
seeking
,
the
widower
pursued
Mrs
General
until
he
prevailed
upon
her
to
form
his
daughter
's
mind
and
manners
.
   
<EOS>
The
execution
of
this
trust
occupied
Mrs
General
about
seven
years
,
in
the
course
of
which
time
she
made
the
tour
of
Europe
,
and
saw
most
of
that
extensive
miscellany
of
objects
which
it
is
essential
that
all
persons
of
polite
cultivation
should
see
with
other
people
's
eyes
,
and
never
with
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
When
her
charge
was
at
length
formed
,
the
marriage
,
not
only
of
the
young
lady
,
but
likewise
of
her
father
,
the
widower
,
was
resolved
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
widower
then
finding
Mrs
General
both
inconvenient
and
expensive
,
became
of
a
sudden
almost
as
much
affected
by
her
merits
as
the
archdeacon
had
been
,
and
circulated
such
praises
of
her
surpassing
worth
,
in
all
quarters
where
he
thought
an
opportunity
might
arise
of
transferring
the
blessing
to
somebody
else
,
that
Mrs
General
was
a
name
more
honourable
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
The
phoenix
was
to
let
,
on
this
elevated
perch
,
when
Mr
Dorrit
,
who
had
lately
succeeded
to
his
property
,
mentioned
to
his
bankers
that
he
wished
to
discover
a
lady
,
well
-
bred
,
accomplished
,
well
connected
,
well
accustomed
to
good
society
,
who
was
qualified
at
once
to
complete
the
education
of
his
daughters
,
and
to
be
their
matron
or
chaperon
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
's
bankers
,
as
bankers
of
the
county
-
widower
,
instantly
said
,
"
Mrs
General
.
"
   
<EOS>
Pursuing
the
light
so
fortunately
hit
upon
,
and
finding
the
concurrent
testimony
of
the
whole
of
Mrs
General
's
acquaintance
to
be
of
the
pathetic
nature
already
recorded
,
Mr
Dorrit
took
the
trouble
of
going
down
to
the
county
of
the
county
-
widower
to
see
Mrs
General
,
in
whom
he
found
a
lady
of
a
quality
superior
to
his
highest
expectations
.
   
<EOS>
"
Might
I
be
excused
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
if
I
inquired
---
ha
---
what
remune
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
indeed
,
"
returned
Mrs
General
,
stopping
the
word
,
"
it
is
a
subject
on
which
I
prefer
to
avoid
entering
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
entered
on
it
with
my
friends
here
;
and
I
can
not
overcome
the
delicacy
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
with
which
I
have
always
regarded
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
,
as
I
hope
you
are
aware
,
a
governess
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
O
dear
no
!
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
madam
,
do
not
imagine
for
a
moment
that
I
think
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
really
blushed
to
be
suspected
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
gravely
inclined
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
therefore
,
put
a
price
upon
services
which
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
render
if
I
can
render
them
spontaneously
,
but
which
I
could
not
render
in
mere
return
for
any
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
<EOS>
do
I
know
how
,
or
where
,
to
find
a
case
parallel
to
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
peculiar
.
"
   
<EOS>
No
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
then
(
Mr
Dorrit
not
unnaturally
hinted
)
could
the
subject
be
approached
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
object
,
"
said
Mrs
General
---
"
though
even
that
is
disagreeable
to
me
---
to
Mr
Dorrit
's
inquiring
,
in
confidence
of
my
friends
here
,
what
amount
they
have
been
accustomed
,
at
quarterly
intervals
,
to
pay
to
my
credit
at
my
bankers
'
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
bowed
his
acknowledgements
.
   
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
to
add
,
"
said
Mrs
General
,
"
that
beyond
this
,
I
can
never
resume
the
topic
.
 
<EOS>
Also
that
I
can
accept
no
second
or
inferior
position
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
honour
were
proposed
to
me
of
becoming
known
to
Mr
Dorrit
's
family
---
I
think
two
daughters
were
mentioned
?
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Two
daughters
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
only
accept
it
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
,
as
a
companion
,
protector
,
Mentor
,
and
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
in
spite
of
his
sense
of
his
importance
,
felt
as
if
it
would
be
quite
a
kindness
in
her
to
accept
it
on
any
conditions
.
<EOS>
He
almost
said
as
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
repeated
Mrs
General
,
"
two
daughters
were
mentioned
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Two
daughters
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
therefore
,
"
said
Mrs
General
,
"
be
necessary
to
add
a
third
more
to
the
payment
<EOS>
(
whatever
its
amount
may
prove
to
be
)
,
which
my
friends
here
have
been
accustomed
to
make
to
my
bankers
'
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
lost
no
time
in
referring
the
delicate
question
to
the
county
-
widower
,
and
finding
that
he
had
been
accustomed
to
pay
three
hundred
pounds
a
-
year
to
the
credit
of
Mrs
General
,
arrived
,
without
any
severe
strain
on
his
arithmetic
,
at
the
conclusion
that
he
himself
must
pay
four
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
being
an
article
of
that
lustrous
surface
which
suggests
that
it
is
worth
any
money
,
he
made
a
formal
proposal
to
be
allowed
to
have
the
honour
and
pleasure
of
regarding
her
as
a
member
of
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
conceded
that
high
privilege
,
and
here
she
was
.
   
<EOS>
In
person
,
Mrs
General
,
including
her
skirts
which
had
much
to
do
with
it
,
was
of
a
dignified
and
imposing
appearance
;
ample
,
rustling
,
gravely
voluminous
;
always
upright
behind
the
proprieties
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
have
been
taken
---
had
been
taken
---
to
the
top
of
the
Alps
and
the
bottom
of
Herculaneum
,
without
disarranging
a
fold
in
her
dress
,
or
displacing
a
pin
.
 
<EOS>
If
her
countenance
and
hair
had
rather
a
floury
appearance
,
as
though
from
living
in
some
transcendently
genteel
Mill
,
it
was
rather
because
she
was
a
chalky
creation
altogether
,
than
because
she
mended
her
complexion
with
violet
powder
,
or
had
turned
grey
.
 
<EOS>
If
her
eyes
had
no
expression
,
it
was
probably
because
they
had
nothing
to
express
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
few
wrinkles
,
it
was
because
her
mind
had
never
traced
its
name
or
any
other
inscription
on
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
A
cool
,
waxy
,
blown
-
out
woman
,
who
had
never
lighted
well
.
<EOS>
Mrs
General
had
no
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
Her
way
of
forming
a
mind
was
to
prevent
it
from
forming
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
little
circular
set
of
mental
grooves
or
rails
on
which
she
started
little
trains
of
other
people
's
opinions
,
which
never
overtook
one
another
,
and
never
got
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Even
her
propriety
could
not
dispute
that
there
was
impropriety
in
the
world
;
but
Mrs
General
's
way
of
getting
rid
of
it
was
to
put
it
out
of
sight
,
and
make
believe
that
there
was
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
another
of
her
ways
of
forming
a
mind
---
to
cram
all
articles
of
difficulty
into
cupboards
,
lock
them
up
,
and
say
they
had
no
existence
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
easiest
way
,
and
,
beyond
all
comparison
,
the
properest
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
was
not
to
be
told
of
anything
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
Accidents
,
miseries
,
and
offences
,
were
never
to
be
mentioned
before
her
.
<EOS>
Passion
was
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
presence
of
Mrs
General
,
and
blood
was
to
change
to
milk
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
that
was
left
in
the
world
,
when
all
these
deductions
were
made
,
it
was
Mrs
General
's
province
to
varnish
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
formation
process
of
hers
,
she
dipped
the
smallest
of
brushes
into
the
largest
of
pots
,
and
varnished
the
surface
of
every
object
that
came
under
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
cracked
it
was
,
the
more
Mrs
General
varnished
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
varnish
in
Mrs
General
's
voice
,
varnish
in
Mrs
General
's
touch
,
an
atmosphere
of
varnish
round
Mrs
General
's
figure
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
's
dreams
ought
to
have
been
varnished
---
if
she
had
any
---
lying
asleep
in
the
arms
of
the
good
Saint
Bernard
,
with
the
feathery
snow
falling
on
his
house
-
top

Chapter
03
.
<EOS>
On
the
Road
 
<EOS>
The
bright
morning
sun
dazzled
the
eyes
,
the
snow
had
ceased
,
the
mists
had
vanished
,
the
mountain
air
was
so
clear
and
light
that
the
new
sensation
of
breathing
it
was
like
the
having
entered
on
a
new
existence
.
 
<EOS>
To
help
the
delusion
,
the
solid
ground
itself
seemed
gone
,
and
the
mountain
,
a
shining
waste
of
immense
white
heaps
and
masses
,
to
be
a
region
of
cloud
floating
between
the
blue
sky
above
and
the
earth
far
below
.
   
<EOS>
Some
dark
specks
in
the
snow
,
like
knots
upon
a
little
thread
,
beginning
at
the
convent
door
and
winding
away
down
the
descent
in
broken
lengths
which
were
not
yet
pieced
together
,
showed
where
the
Brethren
were
at
work
in
several
places
clearing
the
track
.
<EOS>
Already
the
snow
had
begun
to
be
foot
-
thawed
again
about
the
door
.
<EOS>
Mules
were
busily
brought
out
,
tied
to
the
rings
in
the
wall
,
and
laden
;
strings
of
bells
were
buckled
on
,
burdens
were
adjusted
,
the
voices
of
drivers
and
riders
sounded
musically
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
earliest
had
even
already
resumed
their
journey
;
and
,
both
on
the
level
summit
by
the
dark
water
near
the
convent
,
and
on
the
downward
way
of
yesterday
's
ascent
,
little
moving
figures
of
men
and
mules
,
reduced
to
miniatures
by
the
immensity
around
,
went
with
a
clear
tinkling
of
bells
and
a
pleasant
harmony
of
tongues
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
supper
-
room
of
last
night
,
a
new
fire
,
piled
upon
the
feathery
ashes
of
the
old
one
,
shone
upon
a
homely
breakfast
of
loaves
,
butter
,
and
milk
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
shone
on
the
courier
of
the
Dorrit
family
,
making
tea
for
his
party
from
a
supply
he
had
brought
up
with
him
,
together
with
several
other
small
stores
which
were
chiefly
laid
in
for
the
use
of
the
strong
body
of
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gowan
and
Blandois
of
Paris
had
already
breakfasted
,
and
were
walking
up
and
down
by
the
lake
,
smoking
their
cigars
.
<EOS>
"
Gowan
,
eh
?
"
muttered
Tip
,
otherwise
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
,
when
the
courier
had
left
them
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
Gowan
is
the
name
of
a
puppy
,
that
's
all
I
have
got
to
say
!
 
<EOS>
If
it
was
worth
<EOS>
my
while
<EOS>
,
I
'd
pull
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
n't
worth
my
while
---
fortunately
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
How
's
his
wife
,
Amy
?
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
generally
know
things
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
better
,
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
are
not
going
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
going
to
-
day
!
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
that
fellow
too
,
"
said
Tip
,
"
or
he
and
I
might
have
come
into
collision
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
thought
better
here
that
she
should
lie
quiet
to
-
day
,
and
not
be
fatigued
and
shaken
by
the
ride
down
until
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
talk
as
if
you
had
been
nursing
her
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
been
relapsing
into
<EOS>
(
Mrs
General
is
not
here
)
into
old
habits
,
have
you
,
Amy
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
asked
her
the
question
with
a
sly
glance
of
observation
at
Miss
Fanny
,
and
at
his
father
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
been
in
to
ask
her
if
I
could
do
anything
for
her
,
Tip
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
call
me
Tip
,
Amy
child
,
"
returned
that
young
gentleman
with
a
frown
;
"
because
that
's
an
old
habit
,
and
one
you
may
as
well
lay
aside
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
say
so
,
Edward
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
natural
once
,
that
it
seemed
at
the
moment
the
right
word
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
struck
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Natural
,
and
right
word
,
and
once
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
Nonsense
,
you
little
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
perfectly
well
why
you
have
been
taking
such
an
interest
in
this
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
blind
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
try
to
,
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
angry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
angry
!
<EOS>
"
returned
that
young
lady
with
a
flounce
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
patience
"
(
which
indeed
was
the
truth
)
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Fanny
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
raising
his
eyebrows
,
"
what
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Explain
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
Pa
,
"
replied
Miss
Fanny
,
"
it
's
no
great
matter
.
<EOS>
Amy
will
understand
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
,
or
knew
of
,
this
Mrs
Gowan
before
yesterday
,
and
she
may
as
well
admit
that
she
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
child
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
turning
to
his
younger
daughter
,
"
has
your
sister
---
any
---
ha
---
authority
for
this
curious
statement
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
However
meek
we
are
,
"
Miss
Fanny
struck
in
before
she
could
answer
,
"
we
do
n't
go
creeping
into
people
's
rooms
on
the
tops
of
cold
mountains
,
and
sitting
perishing
in
the
frost
with
people
,
unless
we
know
something
about
them
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
very
hard
to
divine
whose
friend
Mrs
Gowan
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whose
friend
?
"
inquired
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pa
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
"
returned
Miss
Fanny
,
who
had
by
this
time
succeeded
in
goading
herself
into
a
state
of
much
ill
-
usage
and
grievance
,
which
she
was
often
at
great
pains
to
do
:
"
<EOS>
that
I
believe
her
to
be
a
friend
of
that
very
objectionable
and
unpleasant
person
,
who
,
with
a
total
absence
of
all
delicacy
,
which
our
experience
might
have
led
us
to
expect
from
him
,
insulted
us
and
outraged
our
feelings
in
so
public
and
wilful
a
manner
on
an
occasion
to
which
it
is
understood
among
us
that
we
will
not
more
pointedly
allude
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
my
child
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
tempering
a
bland
severity
with
a
dignified
affection
,
"
is
this
the
case
?
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
mildly
answered
,
yes
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
!
 
<EOS>
I
said
so
!
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
Pa
,
I
do
declare
once
for
all
"
---
this
young
lady
was
in
the
habit
of
declaring
the
same
thing
once
for
all
every
day
of
her
life
,
and
even
several
times
in
a
day
---
"
that
this
is
shameful
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
declare
once
for
all
that
it
ought
to
be
put
a
stop
to
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
enough
that
we
have
gone
through
what
is
only
known
to
ourselves
,
but
are
we
to
have
it
thrown
in
our
faces
,
perseveringly
and
systematically
,
by
the
very
person
who
should
spare
our
feelings
most
?
 
<EOS>
Are
we
to
be
exposed
to
this
unnatural
conduct
every
moment
of
our
lives
?
 
<EOS>
Are
we
never
to
be
permitted
to
forget
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
it
is
absolutely
infamous
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Amy
,
"
observed
her
brother
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
you
know
I
stand
by
you
whenever
I
can
,
and
on
most
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
say
,
that
,
upon
my
soul
,
I
do
consider
it
rather
an
unaccountable
mode
of
showing
your
sisterly
affection
,
that
you
should
back
up
a
man
who
treated
me
in
the
most
ungentlemanly
way
in
which
one
man
can
treat
another
.
 
<EOS>
And
who
,
"
he
added
convincingly
,
must
be
a
low
-
minded
thief
,
you
know
,
or
he
never
could
have
conducted
himself
as
he
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
see
,
"
said
Miss
Fanny
,
"
see
what
is
involved
in
this
!
 
<EOS>
Can
we
ever
hope
to
be
respected
by
our
servants
?
 
<EOS>
Never
.
 
<EOS>
Here
are
our
two
women
,
and
Pa
's
valet
,
and
a
footman
,
and
a
courier
,
and
all
sorts
of
dependents
,
and
<EOS>
yet
in
the
midst
of
these
,
we
are
to
have
one
of
ourselves
rushing
about
with
tumblers
of
cold
water
,
like
a
menial
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
a
policeman
,
"
said
Miss
Fanny
,
"
if
a
beggar
had
a
fit
in
the
street
,
could
but
go
plunging
about
with
tumblers
,
as
this
very
Amy
did
in
this
very
room
before
our
very
eyes
last
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
so
much
mind
that
,
once
in
a
way
,
"
remarked
Mr
Edward
;
"
but
your
Clennam
,
as
he
thinks
proper
to
call
himself
,
is
another
thing
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
is
part
of
the
same
thing
,
"
returned
Miss
Fanny
,
"
and
of
a
piece
with
all
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
He
obtruded
himself
upon
us
in
the
first
instance
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
wanted
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
showed
him
,
for
one
,
that
I
could
have
dispensed
with
his
company
with
the
greatest
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
He
then
commits
that
gross
outrage
upon
our
feelings
,
which
he
never
could
or
would
have
committed
but
for
the
delight
he
took
in
exposing
us
;
and
then
we
are
to
be
demeaned
for
the
service
of
his
friends
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
do
n't
wonder
at
this
Mr
Gowan
's
conduct
towards
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
else
was
to
be
expected
when
he
was
enjoying
our
past
misfortunes
---
gloating
over
them
at
the
moment
!
"
<EOS>
"
Father
---
Edward
---
no
indeed
!
"
pleaded
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
Mr
nor
Mrs
Gowan
had
ever
heard
our
name
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
,
and
they
are
,
quite
ignorant
of
our
history
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
worse
,
"
retorted
Fanny
,
determined
not
to
admit
anything
in
extenuation
,
"
for
then
you
have
no
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
had
known
about
us
,
you
might
have
felt
yourself
called
upon
to
conciliate
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
have
been
a
weak
and
ridiculous
mistake
,
but
I
can
respect
a
mistake
,
whereas
I
ca
n't
respect
a
wilful
and
deliberate
abasing
of
those
who
should
be
nearest
and
dearest
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
respect
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
but
denounce
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
offend
you
wilfully
,
Fanny
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
though
you
are
so
hard
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
should
be
more
careful
,
Amy
,
"
returned
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
such
things
by
accident
,
you
should
be
more
careful
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
happened
to
have
been
born
in
a
peculiar
place
,
and
under
peculiar
circumstances
that
blunted
my
knowledge
of
propriety
,
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
should
think
myself
bound
to
consider
at
every
step
,
"
Am
I
going
,
ignorantly
,
to
compromise
any
near
and
dear
relations
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
is
what
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
should
do
,
if
it
was
my
case
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
now
interposed
,
at
once
to
stop
these
painful
subjects
by
his
authority
,
and
to
point
their
moral
by
his
wisdom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
he
to
his
younger
daughter
,
"
I
beg
you
to
---
ha
---
to
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Your
sister
Fanny
expresses
herself
strongly
,
but
not
without
considerable
reason
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
now
a

hum

a
great
position
to
support
.
 
<EOS>
That
great
position
is
not
occupied
by
yourself

by
---
ha

by
me
,
and

by
us

<EOS>
Us
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
it
is
incumbent
upon
all
people
in
an
exalted
position
,
but
it
is
particularly
so
on
this
family
,
for
reasons
which
I

will
not
dwell
upon

to

<EOS>
To
be
vigilant

making
themselves
respected

Dependants

Down

Therefore
,
your
not
exposing
yourself
to
the
remarks

our
attendants

appearing
to
have
at

dispensed
with
their

We

I

Hum

<EOS>
A
well
-
behaved
person
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
will
I
inquire
whether
Mr
Clennam
did
,
at
any
time
,
obtrude
himself
on
---
ha
---
my
society
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
my
society
to
be

hum
---
sought
,
and
his
plea
might
be
that
he
regarded
me
in
the
light
of
a
public
character
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
were
circumstances
attending
my
---
ha
---
slight
knowledge
of
Mr
Clennam
<EOS>
(
it
was
very
slight
)
,
which
,
"
here
Mr
Dorrit
became
extremely
grave
and
impressive
,
"
would
render
it
highly
indelicate
in
Mr
Clennam
to
---
ha
---
to
seek
to
renew
communication
with
me
or
with
any
member
of
my
family
under
existing
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Clennam
has
sufficient
delicacy
to
perceive
the
impropriety
of
any
such
attempt
,
I
am
bound
as
a
responsible
gentleman
to
---
ha
---
defer
to
that
delicacy
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
Mr
Clennam
has
not
that
delicacy
,
I
can
not
for
a
moment

ha
---
hold
any
correspondence
with
so

hum
---
coarse
a
mind
.
 
<EOS>
In
either
case
,
it
would
appear
that
Mr
Clennam
is
put
altogether
out
of
the
question
,
and
that
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
or
he
with
us

The
entrance
of
the
lady
whom
he
announced
,
to
take
her
place
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
terminated
the
discussion
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
courier
announced
that
the
valet
,
and
the
footman
,
and
the
two
maids
,
and
the
four
guides
,
and
the
fourteen
mules
,
were
in
readiness
;
so
the
breakfast
party
went
out
to
the
convent
door
to
join
the
cavalcade
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gowan
stood
aloof
with
his
cigar
and
pencil
,
but
Mr
Blandois
was
on
the
spot
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
gallantly
pulled
off
his
slouched
hat
to
Little
Dorrit
,
she
thought
he
had
even
a
more
sinister
look
,
standing
swart
and
cloaked
in
the
snow
,
than
he
had
in
the
fire
-
light
over
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
both
her
father
and
her
sister
received
his
homage
with
some
favour
,
she
refrained
from
expressing
any
distrust
of
him
,
lest
it
should
prove
to
be
a
new
blemish
derived
from
her
prison
birth
.
   
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
as
they
wound
down
the
rugged
way
while
the
convent
was
yet
in
sight
,
she
more
than
once
looked
round
,
and
descried
Mr
Blandois
,
backed
by
the
convent
smoke
which
rose
straight
and
high
from
the
chimneys
in
a
golden
film
,
always
standing
on
one
jutting
point
looking
down
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
Long
after
he
was
a
mere
black
stick
in
the
snow
,
she
felt
as
though
she
could
yet
see
that
smile
of
his
,
that
high
nose
,
and
those
eyes
that
were
too
near
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
even
after
that
,
when
the
convent
was
gone
and
some
light
morning
clouds
veiled
the
pass
below
it
,
the
ghastly
skeleton
arms
by
the
wayside
seemed
to
be
all
pointing
up
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
More
treacherous
than
snow
,
perhaps
,
colder
at
heart
,
and
harder
to
melt
,
<EOS>
Blandois
of
Paris
by
degrees
passed
out
of
her
mind
,
as
they
came
down
into
the
softer
regions
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
sun
was
warm
,
again
the
streams
descending
from
glaciers
and
snowy
caverns
were
refreshing
to
drink
at
,
again
they
came
among
the
pine
-
trees
,
the
rocky
rivulets
,
the
verdant
heights
and
dales
,
the
wooden
chalets
and
rough
zigzag
fences
of
Swiss
country
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
way
so
widened
that
she
and
her
father
could
ride
abreast
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
to
look
at
him
,
handsomely
clothed
in
his
fur
and
broadcloths
,
rich
<EOS>
,
free
,
numerously
served
and
attended
,
his
eyes
roving
far
away
among
the
glories
of
the
landscape
,
no
miserable
screen
before
them
to
darken
his
sight
and
cast
its
shadow
on
him
,
was
enough
.
   
<EOS>
Her
uncle
was
so
far
rescued
from
that
shadow
of
old
,
that
he
wore
the
clothes
they
gave
him
,
and
performed
some
ablutions
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
family
credit
,
and
went
where
he
was
taken
,
with
a
certain
patient
animal
enjoyment
,
which
seemed
to
express
that
the
air
and
change
did
him
good
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
other
respects
,
save
one
,
he
shone
with
no
light
but
such
as
was
reflected
from
his
brother
.
<EOS>
His
brother
's
greatness
,
wealth
,
freedom
,
and
grandeur
,
pleased
him
without
any
reference
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Silent
and
retiring
,
he
had
no
use
for
speech
when
he
could
hear
his
brother
speak
;
no
desire
to
be
waited
on
,
so
that
the
servants
devoted
themselves
to
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
noticeable
change
he
originated
in
himself
,
was
an
alteration
in
his
manner
to
his
younger
niece
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
it
refined
more
and
more
into
a
marked
respect
,
very
rarely
shown
by
age
to
youth
,
and
still
more
rarely
susceptible
,
one
would
have
said
,
of
the
fitness
with
which
he
invested
it
.
 
<EOS>
On
those
occasions
when
Miss
Fanny
did
declare
once
for
all
,
he
would
take
the
next
opportunity
of
baring
his
grey
head
before
his
younger
niece
,
and
of
helping
her
to
alight
,
or
handing
her
to
the
carriage
,
or
showing
her
any
other
attention
,
with
the
profoundest
deference
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
never
appeared
misplaced
or
forced
,
being
always
heartily
simple
,
spontaneous
,
and
genuine
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
would
he
ever
consent
,
even
at
his
brother
's
request
,
to
be
helped
to
any
place
before
her
,
or
to
take
precedence
of
her
in
anything
.
 
<EOS>
So
jealous
was
he
of
her
being
respected
,
that
,
on
this
very
journey
down
from
the
Great
Saint
Bernard
,
he
took
sudden
and
violent
umbrage
at
the
footman
's
being
remiss
to
hold
her
stirrup
,
though
standing
near
when
she
dismounted
;
and
unspeakably
astonished
the
whole
retinue
by
charging
at
him
on
a
hard
-
headed
mule
,
riding
him
into
a
corner
,
and
threatening
to
trample
him
to
death
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
a
goodly
company
,
and
the
Innkeepers
all
but
worshipped
them
.
 
<EOS>
Wherever
they
went
,
their
importance
preceded
them
in
the
person
of
the
courier
riding
before
,
to
see
that
the
rooms
of
state
were
ready
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
herald
of
the
family
procession
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
travelling
-
carriage
came
next
:
containing
,
inside
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
Miss
Dorrit
,
Miss
Amy
Dorrit
,
and
Mrs
General
;
outside
,
some
of
the
retainers
,
and
(
in
fine
weather
)
<EOS>
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
for
whom
the
box
was
reserved
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
chariot
containing
Frederick
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
and
an
empty
place
occupied
by
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
in
wet
weather
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
fourgon
with
the
rest
of
the
retainers
,
the
heavy
baggage
,
and
as
much
as
it
could
carry
of
the
mud
and
dust
which
the
other
vehicles
left
behind
.
   
<EOS>
These
equipages
adorned
the
yard
of
the
hotel
at
Martigny
,
on
the
return
of
the
family
from
their
mountain
excursion
.
 
<EOS>
Other
vehicles
were
there
,
much
company
being
on
the
road
,
from
the
patched
Italian
Vettura
---
like
the
body
of
a
swing
from
an
English
fair
put
upon
a
wooden
tray
on
wheels
,
and
having
another
wooden
tray
without
wheels
put
atop
of
it
---
to
the
trim
English
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
another
adornment
of
the
hotel
which
Mr
Dorrit
had
not
bargained
for
.
 
<EOS>
Two
strange
travellers
embellished
one
of
his
rooms
.
   
<EOS>
The
Innkeeper
,
hat
in
hand
in
the
yard
,
swore
to
the
courier
that
he
was
blighted
,
that
he
was
desolated
,
that
he
was
profoundly
afflicted
,
that
he
was
the
most
miserable
and
unfortunate
of
beasts
,
that
he
had
the
head
of
a
wooden
pig
.
 
<EOS>
He
ought
never
to
have
made
the
concession
,
he
said
,
but
the
very
genteel
lady
had
so
passionately
prayed
him
for
the
accommodation
of
that
room
to
dine
in
,
only
for
a
little
half
-
hour
,
that
he
had
been
vanquished
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
half
-
hour
was
expired
,
the
lady
and
gentleman
were
taking
their
little
dessert
and
half
-
cup
of
coffee
,
the
note
was
paid
,
the
horses
were
ordered
,
they
would
depart
immediately
;
but
,
owing
to
an
unhappy
destiny
and
the
curse
of
Heaven
,
they
were
not
yet
gone
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
could
exceed
Mr
Dorrit
's
indignation
,
as
he
turned
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
on
hearing
these
apologies
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
that
the
family
dignity
was
struck
at
by
an
assassin
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
sense
of
his
dignity
,
which
was
of
the
most
exquisite
nature
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
detect
a
design
upon
it
when
nobody
else
had
any
perception
of
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
His
life
was
made
an
agony
by
the
number
of
fine
scalpels
that
he
felt
to
be
incessantly
engaged
in
dissecting
his
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
reddening
excessively
,
"
that
you
have
<EOS>
---
ha
---
had
the
audacity
to
place
one
of
my
rooms
at
the
disposition
of
any
other
person
?
"
   
<EOS>
Thousands
of
pardons
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
host
's
profound
misfortune
to
have
been
overcome
by
that
too
genteel
lady
.
 
<EOS>
He
besought
Monseigneur
not
to
enrage
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
on
Monseigneur
for
clemency
.
 
<EOS>
If
Monseigneur
would
have
the
distinguished
goodness
to
occupy
the
other
salon
especially
reserved
for
him
,
for
but
<EOS>
five
minutes
,
all
would
go
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
occupy
any
salon
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
leave
your
house
without
eating
or
drinking
,
or
setting
foot
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
How
do
you
dare
to
act
like
this
?
 
<EOS>
Who
am
I
that
you
---
ha
---
separate
me
from
other
gentlemen
?
"
   
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
The
host
called
all
the
universe
to
witness
that
Monseigneur
was
the
most
amiable
of
the
whole
body
of
nobility
,
the
most
important
,
the
most
estimable
,
the
most
honoured
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
separated
Monseigneur
from
others
,
it
was
only
because
he
was
more
distinguished
,
more
cherished
,
more
generous
,
more
renowned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
so
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Dorrit
,
in
a
mighty
heat
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
affronted
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
heaped
insults
upon

How
dare

<EOS>
Explain
yourself

"
   
<EOS>
Ah
,
just
Heaven
,
then
,
how
could
the
host
explain
himself
when
he
had
nothing
more
to
explain
;
when
he
had
only
to
apologise
,
and
confide
himself
to
the
so
well
-
known
magnanimity
of
Monseigneur
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
panting
with
anger
,
"
that
you
separate
me

from
other

that
you

distinctions

<EOS>
Permit
the
landlord
humbly
to
submit
to
Monsieur
the
Courier
then
,
that
Monseigneur
,
ordinarily
so
gracious
,
enraged
himself
without
cause
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
why
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
the
Courier
would
represent
to
Monseigneur
,
that
he
deceived
himself
in
suspecting
that
there
was
any
why
,
but
the
why
his
devoted
servant
had
already
had
the
honour
to
present
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
genteel
lady

"
Silence
!
"
cried
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
hear
no
more
of

very
genteel

Look
at

my
family

more
genteel

You
have
treated

with
disrespect

insolent

Ha

send
for
the
horses
,
pack
the

I

foot

house
again

"
   
<EOS>
No
one
had
interfered
in
the
dispute
,
which
was
beyond
the
French
colloquial
powers
of
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
and
scarcely
within
the
province
of
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
,
however
,
now
supported
her
father
with
great
bitterness
;
declaring
,
in
her
native
tongue
,
that
it
was
quite
clear
there
was
something
special
in
this
man
's
impertinence
;
and
that
she
considered
it
important
that
he
should
be
,
by
some
means
,
forced
to
give
up
his
authority
for
making
distinctions
between
that
family
and
other
wealthy
families
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
reasons
of
his
presumption
could
be
,
she
was
at
a
loss
to
imagine
;
but
reasons
he
must
have
,
and
they
ought
to
be
torn
from
him
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
guides
,
mule
-
drivers
,
and
idlers
in
the
yard
,
had
made
themselves
parties
to
the
angry
conference
,
and
were
much
impressed
by
the
courier
's
now
bestirring
himself
to
get
the
carriages
out
.
<EOS>
With
the
aid
of
some
dozen
people
to
each
wheel
,
this
was
done
at
a
great
cost
of
noise
;
and
then
the
loading
was
proceeded
with
,
pending
the
arrival
of
the
horses
from
the
post
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
very
genteel
lady
's
English
chariot
being
already
horsed
and
at
the
inn
-
door
,
the
landlord
had
slipped
up
-
stairs
to
represent
his
hard
case
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
notified
to
the
yard
by
his
now
coming
down
the
staircase
in
attendance
on
the
gentleman
and
the
lady
,
and
by
his
pointing
out
the
offended
majesty
of
Mr
Dorrit
to
them
with
a
significant
motion
of
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
detaching
himself
from
the
lady
,
and
coming
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
man
of
few
words
and
a
bad
hand
at
an
explanation
---
but
lady
here
is
extremely
anxious
that
there
should
be
no
Row
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
---
a
mother
of
mine
,
in
point
of
fact
---
wishes
me
to
say
that
she
hopes
no
Row
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
still
panting
under
his
injury
,
saluted
the
gentleman
,
and
saluted
the
lady
,
in
a
distant
,
final
,
and
invincible
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
but
really
---
here
,
old
feller
;
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
gentleman
's
way
of
appealing
to
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
on
whom
he
pounced
as
a
great
and
providential
relief
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
you
and
I
try
to
make
this
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
so
very
much
wishes
no
Row
.
"
   
<EOS>
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
led
a
little
apart
by
the
button
,
assumed
a
diplomatic
expression
of
countenance
in
replying
,
"
Why
you
must
confess
,
that
when
you
bespeak
a
lot
of
rooms
beforehand
,
and
they
belong
to
you
,
it
's
not
pleasant
to
find
other
people
in
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
I
know
it
is
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
admit
it
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
let
you
and
I
try
to
make
it
all
right
,
and
avoid
Row
.
 
<EOS>
The
fault
is
not
this
chap
's
at
all
,
but
my
mother
's
.
 
<EOS>
Being
a
remarkably
fine
woman
with
no
bigodd
nonsense
about
her
---
well
educated
,
too
<EOS>
---
she
was
too
many
for
this
chap
.
 
<EOS>
Regularly
pocketed
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
that
's
the
case
---
"
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Assure
you
"
pon
my
soul
<EOS>
"
tis
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
"
said
the
other
gentleman
,
retiring
on
his
main
position
,
"
why
Row
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Edmund
,
"
said
the
lady
from
the
doorway
,
"
I
hope
you
have
explained
,
or
are
explaining
,
to
the
satisfaction
of
this
gentleman
and
his
family
that
the
civil
landlord
is
not
to
blame
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Assure
you
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Edmund
,
"
perfectly
paralysing
myself
with
trying
it
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
looked
steadfastly
at
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
for
some
seconds
,
and
suddenly
added
,
in
a
burst
of
confidence
,
"
Old
feller
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
all
right
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
after
all
,
"
said
the
lady
,
gracefully
advancing
a
step
or
two
towards
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
but
that
I
had
better
say
myself
,
at
once
,
that
I
assured
this
good
man
<EOS>
I
took
all
the
consequences
on
myself
of
occupying
one
of
a
stranger
's
suite
of
rooms
during
his
absence
,
for
just
as
much
(
or
as
little
)
time
as
I
could
dine
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
idea
the
rightful
owner
would
come
back
so
soon
,
nor
had
I
any
idea
that
he
had
come
back
,
or
I
should
have
hastened
to
make
restoration
of
my
ill
-
gotten
chamber
,
and
to
have
offered
my
explanation
and
apology
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
in
saying
this
---
"
   
For
a
moment
the
lady
,
with
a
glass
at
her
eye
,
stood
transfixed
and
speechless
before
the
two
Miss
Dorrits
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
Miss
Fanny
,
in
the
foreground
of
a
grand
pictorial
composition
,
formed
by
the
family
,
the
family
equipages
,
and
the
family
servants
,
held
her
sister
tight
under
one
arm
to
detain
her
on
the
spot
,
and
with
the
other
arm
fanned
herself
with
a
distinguished
air
,
and
negligently
surveyed
the
lady
from
head
to
foot
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
,
recovering
herself
quickly
---
for
it
was
Mrs
Merdle
<EOS>
and
she
was
not
easily
dashed
---
went
on
to
add
that
she
trusted
in
saying
this
,
she
apologised
for
her
boldness
,
and
restored
this
well
-
behaved
landlord
to
the
favour
that
was
so
very
valuable
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
on
the
altar
of
whose
dignity
all
this
was
incense
,
made
a
gracious
reply
;
and
said
that
his
people
should
---
ha
---
countermand
his
horses
,
and
he
would
---
hum
<EOS>
---
overlook
what
he
had
at
first
supposed
to
be
an
affront
,
but
now
regarded
as
an
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
bosom
bent
to
him
;
and
its
owner
,
with
a
wonderful
command
of
feature
,
addressed
a
winning
smile
of
adieu
to
the
two
sisters
,
as
young
ladies
of
fortune
in
whose
favour
she
was
much
prepossessed
,
and
whom
she
had
never
had
the
gratification
of
seeing
before
.
   
<EOS>
Not
so
,
however
,
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
becoming
transfixed
at
the
same
moment
as
his
lady
-
mother
,
could
not
by
any
means
unfix
himself
again
,
but
stood
stiffly
staring
at
the
whole
composition
with
Miss
Fanny
in
the
Foreground
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
mother
saying
,
"
Edmund
,
we
are
quite
ready
;
will
you
give
me
your
arm
?
"
<EOS>
he
seemed
,
by
the
motion
of
his
lips
,
to
reply
with
some
remark
comprehending
the
form
of
words
in
which
his
shining
talents
found
the
most
frequent
utterance
,
but
he
relaxed
no
muscle
.
 
<EOS>
So
fixed
was
his
figure
,
that
it
would
have
been
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
bend
him
sufficiently
to
get
him
in
the
carriage
-
door
,
if
he
had
not
received
the
timely
assistance
of
a
maternal
pull
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
within
than
the
pad
of
the
little
window
in
the
back
of
the
chariot
disappeared
,
and
his
eye
usurped
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
There
it
remained
as
long
as
so
small
an
object
was
discernible
,
and
probably
much
longer
,
staring
(
as
though
something
inexpressibly
surprising
should
happen
to
a
codfish
)
like
an
ill
-
executed
eye
in
a
large
locket
.
   
<EOS>
This
encounter
was
so
highly
agreeable
to
Miss
Fanny
,
and
gave
her
so
much
to
think
of
with
triumph
afterwards
,
that
it
softened
her
asperities
exceedingly
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
procession
was
again
in
motion
next
day
,
she
occupied
her
place
in
it
with
a
new
gaiety
;
and
showed
such
a
flow
of
spirits
indeed
,
that
Mrs
General
looked
rather
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
glad
to
be
found
no
fault
with
,
and
to
see
that
Fanny
was
pleased
;
but
her
part
in
the
procession
was
a
musing
part
,
and
a
quiet
one
.
 
<EOS>
Sitting
opposite
her
father
in
the
travelling
-
carriage
,
and
recalling
the
old
Marshalsea
room
,
her
present
existence
was
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
she
saw
was
new
and
wonderful
,
but
it
was
not
real
;
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
those
visions
of
mountains
and
picturesque
countries
might
melt
away
at
any
moment
,
and
the
carriage
,
turning
some
abrupt
corner
,
bring
up
with
a
jolt
at
the
old
Marshalsea
gate
.
   
<EOS>
To
have
no
work
to
do
was
strange
,
but
not
half
so
strange
as
having
glided
into
a
corner
where
she
had
no
one
to
think
for
,
nothing
to
plan
and
contrive
,
no
cares
of
others
to
load
herself
with
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
as
that
was
,
it
was
far
stranger
yet
to
find
a
space
between
herself
and
her
father
,
where
others
occupied
themselves
in
taking
care
of
him
,
and
where
she
was
never
expected
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
this
was
so
much
more
unlike
her
old
experience
than
even
the
mountains
themselves
,
that
she
had
been
unable
to
resign
herself
to
it
,
and
had
tried
to
retain
her
old
place
about
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
spoken
to
her
alone
,
and
had
said
that
people
---
ha
---
people
in
an
exalted
position
,
my
dear
,
must
scrupulously
exact
respect
from
their
dependents
;
and
that
for
her
,
his
daughter
,
Miss
Amy
Dorrit
,
of
the
sole
remaining
branch
of
the
Dorrits
of
Dorsetshire
,
to
be
known
to
---
hum
---
to
occupy
herself
in
fulfilling
the
functions
of
---
ha
hum
---
a
valet
,
would
be
incompatible
with
that
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
my
dear
,
he
---
ha
---
he
laid
his
parental
injunctions
upon
her
,
to
remember
that
she
was
a
lady
,
who
had
now
to
conduct
herself
with
---
hum
---
a
proper
pride
,
and
to
preserve
the
rank
of
a
lady
;
and
consequently
he
requested
her
to
abstain
from
doing
what
would
occasion
---
ha
---
unpleasant
and
derogatory
remarks
.
<EOS>
She
had
obeyed
without
a
murmur
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
had
been
brought
about
that
she
now
sat
in
her
corner
of
the
luxurious
carriage
with
her
little
patient
hands
folded
before
her
,
quite
displaced
even
from
the
last
point
of
the
old
standing
ground
in
life
on
which
her
feet
had
lingered
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
from
this
position
that
all
she
saw
appeared
unreal
;
the
more
surprising
the
scenes
,
the
more
they
resembled
the
unreality
of
her
own
inner
life
as
she
went
through
its
vacant
places
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
The
gorges
of
the
Simplon
,
its
enormous
depths
and
thundering
waterfalls
,
the
wonderful
road
,
the
points
of
danger
where
a
loose
wheel
or
a
faltering
horse
would
have
been
destruction
,
the
descent
into
Italy
,
the
opening
of
that
beautiful
land
as
the
rugged
mountain
-
chasm
widened
and
let
them
out
from
a
gloomy
and
dark
imprisonment
---
<EOS>
all
a
dream
---
<EOS>
only
the
old
mean
Marshalsea
<EOS>
a
reality
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
even
the
old
mean
Marshalsea
was
shaken
to
its
foundations
when
she
pictured
it
without
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
prisoners
were
still
lingering
in
the
close
yard
,
that
the
mean
rooms
were
still
every
one
tenanted
,
and
that
the
turnkey
still
stood
in
the
Lodge
letting
people
in
and
out
,
all
just
as
she
well
knew
it
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
With
a
remembrance
of
her
father
's
old
life
in
prison
hanging
about
her
like
the
burden
of
a
sorrowful
tune
,
Little
Dorrit
would
wake
from
a
dream
of
her
birth
-
place
into
a
whole
day
's
dream
.
 
<EOS>
The
painted
room
in
which
she
awoke
,
often
a
humbled
state
-
chamber
in
a
dilapidated
palace
,
would
begin
it
;
with
its
wild
red
autumnal
vine
-
leaves
overhanging
the
glass
,
its
orange
-
trees
on
the
cracked
white
terrace
outside
the
window
,
a
group
of
monks
and
peasants
in
the
little
street
below
,
misery
and
magnificence
wrestling
with
each
other
upon
every
rood
of
ground
in
the
prospect
,
no
matter
how
widely
diversified
,
and
misery
throwing
magnificence
with
the
strength
of
fate
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
would
succeed
a
labyrinth
of
bare
passages
and
pillared
galleries
,
with
the
family
procession
already
preparing
in
the
quadrangle
below
,
through
the
carriages
and
luggage
being
brought
together
by
the
servants
for
the
day
's
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Then
breakfast
in
another
painted
chamber
,
damp
-
stained
and
of
desolate
proportions
;
and
then
the
departure
,
which
,
to
her
timidity
and
sense
of
not
being
grand
enough
for
her
place
in
the
ceremonies
,
was
always
an
uneasy
thing
.
 
<EOS>
For
then
the
courier
(
who
himself
would
have
been
a
foreign
gentleman
of
high
mark
in
the
Marshalsea
)
would
present
himself
to
report
that
all
was
ready
;
and
then
her
father
's
valet
would
pompously
induct
him
into
his
travelling
-
cloak
;
and
then
Fanny
's
maid
,
and
her
own
maid
(
who
was
a
weight
on
Little
Dorrit
's
mind
---
absolutely
made
her
cry
at
first
<EOS>
,
she
knew
so
little
what
to
do
with
her
)
,
would
be
in
attendance
;
and
then
her
brother
's
man
would
complete
his
master
's
equipment
;
and
then
her
father
would
give
his
arm
to
Mrs
General
,
and
her
uncle
would
give
his
to
her
,
and
,
escorted
by
the
landlord
and
Inn
servants
,
they
would
swoop
down
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
a
crowd
would
be
collected
to
see
them
enter
their
carriages
,
which
,
amidst
much
bowing
,
and
begging
,
and
prancing
,
and
lashing
,
and
clattering
,
they
would
do
;
and
so
they
would
be
driven
madly
through
narrow
unsavoury
streets
,
and
jerked
out
at
the
town
gate
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
day
's
unrealities
would
be
roads
where
the
bright
red
vines
were
looped
and
garlanded
together
on
trees
for
many
miles
;
woods
of
olives
;
white
villages
and
towns
on
hill
-
sides
,
lovely
without
,
but
frightful
in
their
dirt
and
poverty
within
;
crosses
by
the
way
;
deep
blue
lakes
with
fairy
islands
,
and
clustering
boats
with
awnings
of
bright
colours
and
sails
of
beautiful
forms
;
vast
piles
of
building
mouldering
to
dust
;
hanging
-
gardens
where
the
weeds
had
grown
so
strong
that
their
stems
,
like
wedges
driven
home
,
had
split
the
arch
and
rent
the
wall
;
stone
-
terraced
lanes
,
with
the
lizards
running
into
and
out
of
every
chink
;
beggars
of
all
sorts
everywhere
:
pitiful
,
picturesque
,
hungry
,
merry
;
children
beggars
and
aged
beggars
.
 
<EOS>
Often
at
posting
-
houses
and
other
halting
places
,
these
miserable
creatures
would
appear
to
her
the
only
realities
of
the
day
;
and
many
a
time
,
when
the
money
she
had
brought
to
give
them
was
all
given
away
,
she
would
sit
with
her
folded
hands
,
thoughtfully
looking
after
some
diminutive
girl
leading
her
grey
father
,
as
if
the
sight
reminded
her
of
something
in
the
days
that
were
gone
.
   
<EOS>
Again
,
there
would
be
places
where
they
stayed
the
week
together
in
splendid
rooms
,
had
banquets
every
day
,
rode
out
among
heaps
of
wonders
,
walked
through
miles
of
palaces
,
and
rested
in
dark
corners
of
great
churches
;
where
there
were
winking
lamps
of
gold
and
silver
among
pillars
and
arches
,
kneeling
figures
dotted
about
at
confessionals
and
on
the
pavements
;
where
there
was
the
mist
and
scent
of
incense
;
where
there
were
pictures
,
fantastic
images
,
gaudy
altars
,
great
heights
and
distances
,
all
softly
lighted
through
stained
glass
,
and
the
massive
curtains
that
hung
in
the
doorways
.
 
<EOS>
From
these
cities
they
would
go
on
again
,
by
the
roads
of
vines
and
olives
,
through
squalid
villages
,
where
there
was
not
a
hovel
without
a
gap
in
its
filthy
walls
,
not
a
window
with
a
whole
inch
of
glass
or
paper
;
where
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
support
life
,
nothing
to
eat
,
nothing
to
make
,
nothing
to
grow
,
nothing
to
hope
,
nothing
to
do
but
die
.
   
<EOS>
Again
they
would
come
to
whole
towns
of
palaces
,
whose
proper
inmates
were
all
banished
,
and
which
were
all
changed
into
barracks
:
<EOS>
troops
of
idle
soldiers
leaning
out
of
the
state
windows
,
where
their
accoutrements
hung
drying
on
the
marble
architecture
,
and
showing
to
the
mind
like
hosts
of
rats
who
were
(
happily
)
eating
away
the
props
of
the
edifices
that
supported
them
,
and
must
soon
,
with
them
,
be
smashed
on
the
heads
of
the
other
swarms
of
soldiers
and
the
swarms
of
priests
,
and
the
swarms
of
spies
,
who
were
all
the
ill
-
looking
population
left
to
be
ruined
,
in
the
streets
below
.
   
<EOS>
Through
such
scenes
,
the
family
procession
moved
on
to
Venice
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
it
dispersed
for
a
time
,
as
they
were
to
live
in
Venice
some
few
months
in
a
palace
(
itself
six
times
as
big
as
the
whole
Marshalsea
)
on
the
Grand
Canal
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
crowning
unreality
,
where
all
the
streets
were
paved
with
water
,
and
where
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
days
and
nights
was
broken
by
no
sound
but
the
softened
ringing
of
church
-
bells
,
the
rippling
of
the
current
,
and
the
cry
of
the
gondoliers
turning
the
corners
of
the
flowing
streets
,
Little
Dorrit
,
quite
lost
by
her
task
being
done
,
sat
down
to
muse
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
began
a
gay
life
,
went
here
and
there
,
and
turned
night
into
day
;
but
she
was
timid
of
joining
in
their
gaieties
,
and
only
asked
leave
to
be
left
alone
.
   
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
would
step
into
one
of
the
gondolas
that
were
always
kept
in
waiting
,
moored
to
painted
posts
at
the
door
---
when
she
could
escape
from
the
attendance
of
that
oppressive
maid
,
who
was
her
mistress
,
and
a
very
hard
one
---
and
would
be
taken
all
over
the
strange
city
.
 
<EOS>
Social
people
in
other
gondolas
began
to
ask
each
other
who
the
little
solitary
girl
was
whom
they
passed
,
sitting
in
her
boat
with
folded
hands
,
looking
so
pensively
and
wonderingly
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
Never
thinking
that
it
would
be
worth
anybody
's
while
to
notice
her
or
her
doings
,
Little
Dorrit
,
in
her
quiet
,
scared
,
lost
manner
,
went
about
the
city
none
the
less
.
   
<EOS>
But
her
favourite
station
was
the
balcony
of
her
own
room
,
overhanging
the
canal
,
with
other
balconies
below
,
and
none
above
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
massive
stone
darkened
by
ages
,
built
in
a
wild
fancy
which
came
from
the
East
to
that
collection
of
wild
fancies
;
and
Little
Dorrit
was
little
indeed
,
leaning
on
the
broad
-
cushioned
ledge
,
and
looking
over
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
liked
no
place
of
an
evening
half
so
well
,
she
soon
began
to
be
watched
for
,
and
many
eyes
in
passing
gondolas
were
raised
,
and
many
people
said
,
There
was
the
little
figure
of
the
English
girl
who
was
always
alone
.
   
<EOS>
Such
people
were
not
realities
to
the
little
figure
of
the
English
girl
;
such
people
were
all
unknown
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
watch
the
sunset
,
in
its
long
low
lines
of
purple
and
red
,
and
its
burning
flush
high
up
into
the
sky
:
so
glowing
on
the
buildings
,
and
so
lightening
their
structure
,
that
it
made
them
look
as
if
their
strong
walls
were
transparent
,
and
they
shone
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
watch
those
glories
expire
;
and
then
,
after
looking
at
the
black
gondolas
underneath
,
taking
guests
to
music
and
dancing
,
would
raise
her
eyes
to
the
shining
stars
.
 
<EOS>
Was
there
no
party
of
her
own
,
in
other
times
,
on
which
the
stars
had
shone
?
 
<EOS>
To
think
of
that
old
gate
now
!
 
<EOS>
She
would
think
of
that
old
gate
,
and
of
herself
sitting
at
it
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
pillowing
Maggy
's
head
;
and
of
other
places
and
of
other
scenes
associated
with
those
different
times
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
she
would
lean
upon
her
balcony
,
and
look
over
at
the
water
,
as
though
they
all
lay
underneath
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
got
to
that
,
she
would
musingly
watch
its
running
,
as
if
,
in
the
general
vision
,
it
might
run
dry
,
and
show
her
the
prison
again
,
and
herself
,
and
the
old
room
,
and
the
old
inmates
,
and
the
old
visitors
:
all
lasting
realities
that
had
never
changed
.

A
Letter
from
Little
Dorrit
 
Dear
Mr
Clennam
,
   
<EOS>
I
write
to
you
from
my
own
room
at
Venice
,
thinking
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
you
can
not
be
so
glad
to
hear
from
me
as
I
am
to
write
to
you
;
for
everything
about
you
is
as
you
have
been
accustomed
to
see
it
,
and
you
miss
nothing
---
unless
it
should
be
me
,
which
can
only
be
for
a
very
little
while
together
and
very
seldom
---
while
everything
in
my
life
is
so
strange
,
and
I
miss
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
were
in
Switzerland
,
which
appears
to
have
been
years
ago
,
though
it
was
only
weeks
,
I
met
young
Mrs
Gowan
,
who
was
on
a
mountain
excursion
like
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
me
she
was
very
well
and
very
happy
.
 
<EOS>
She
sent
you
the
message
,
by
me
,
that
she
thanked
you
affectionately
and
would
never
forget
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
quite
confiding
with
me
,
and
I
loved
her
almost
as
soon
as
I
spoke
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
nothing
singular
in
that
;
who
could
help
loving
so
beautiful
and
winning
a
creature
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
wonder
at
any
one
loving
her
.
 
<EOS>
No
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
It
will
not
make
you
uneasy
on
Mrs
Gowan
's
account
<EOS>
,
I
hope
---
<EOS>
for
I
remember
that
you
said
you
had
the
interest
of
a
true
friend
in
her
---
if
I
tell
you
that
I
wish
she
could
have
married
some
one
better
suited
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gowan
seems
fond
of
her
,
and
of
course
she
is
very
fond
of
him
,
but
I
thought
he
was
not
earnest
enough
---
I
do
n't
mean
in
that
respect
---
I
mean
in
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
keep
it
out
of
my
mind
that
if
I
was
Mrs
Gowan
(
what
a
change
that
would
be
,
and
how
I
must
alter
to
become
like
her
!
)
<EOS>
I
should
feel
that
I
was
rather
lonely
and
lost
,
for
the
want
of
some
one
who
was
steadfast
and
firm
in
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
even
thought
she
felt
this
want
a
little
,
almost
without
knowing
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
mind
you
are
not
made
uneasy
by
this
,
for
she
was
"
very
well
and
very
happy
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
looked
most
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
I
expect
to
meet
her
again
before
long
,
and
indeed
have
been
expecting
for
some
days
past
to
see
her
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
ever
be
as
good
a
friend
to
her
as
I
can
for
your
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Clennam
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
you
think
little
of
having
been
a
friend
to
me
when
I
had
no
other
(
not
that
I
have
any
other
now
,
for
I
have
made
no
new
friends
)
,
but
<EOS>
I
think
much
of
it
,
and
I
never
can
forget
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
I
knew
---
but
it
is
best
for
no
one
to
write
to
me
---
how
Mr
and
Mrs
Plornish
prosper
in
the
business
which
my
dear
father
bought
for
them
,
and
that
old
Mr
Nandy
lives
happily
with
them
and
his
two
grandchildren
,
and
sings
all
his
songs
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
quite
keep
back
the
tears
from
my
eyes
when
I
think
of
my
poor
Maggy
,
and
of
the
blank
<EOS>
she
must
have
felt
at
first
,
however
kind
they
all
are
to
her
,
without
her
Little
Mother
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
go
and
tell
her
,
as
a
strict
secret
,
with
my
love
,
that
she
never
can
have
regretted
our
separation
more
than
I
have
regretted
it
?
 
<EOS>
And
will
you
tell
them
all
that
I
have
thought
of
them
every
day
,
and
that
my
heart
is
faithful
to
them
everywhere
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
if
you
could
know
how
faithful
,
you
would
almost
pity
me
for
being
so
far
away
and
being
so
grand
!
   
<EOS>
You
will
be
glad
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
to
know
that
my
dear
father
is
very
well
in
health
,
and
that
all
these
changes
are
highly
beneficial
to
him
,
and
that
he
is
very
different
indeed
from
what
he
used
to
be
when
you
used
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
improvement
in
my
uncle
too
,
I
think
,
though
he
never
complained
of
old
,
and
never
exults
now
.
<EOS>
Fanny
is
very
graceful
,
quick
,
and
clever
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
natural
to
her
to
be
a
lady
;
she
has
adapted
herself
to
our
new
fortunes
with
wonderful
ease
.
   
<EOS>
This
reminds
me
that
I
have
not
been
able
to
do
so
,
and
that
I
sometimes
almost
despair
of
ever
being
able
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
I
can
not
learn
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
is
always
with
us
,
and
we
speak
French
and
speak
Italian
,
and
she
takes
pains
to
form
us
in
many
ways
.
<EOS>
When
I
say
we
speak
French
and
Italian
,
I
mean
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
am
so
slow
that
I
scarcely
get
on
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
begin
to
plan
,
and
think
,
and
try
,
all
my
planning
,
thinking
,
and
trying
go
in
old
directions
,
and
I
begin
to
feel
careful
again
about
the
expenses
of
the
day
,
and
about
my
dear
father
,
and
about
my
work
,
and
then
I
remember
with
a
start
that
there
are
no
such
cares
left
,
and
that
in
itself
is
so
new
and
improbable
that
it
sets
me
wandering
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
the
courage
to
mention
this
to
any
one
but
you
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
the
same
with
all
these
new
countries
and
wonderful
sights
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
beautiful
,
and
they
astonish
me
,
but
I
am
not
collected
enough
---
not
familiar
enough
with
myself
,
if
you
can
quite
understand
what
I
mean
---
to
have
all
the
pleasure
in
them
that
I
might
have
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
knew
before
them
,
blends
with
them
,
too
,
so
curiously
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
when
we
were
among
the
mountains
,
I
often
felt
(
I
hesitate
to
tell
such
an
idle
thing
,
<EOS>
dear
Mr
Clennam
,
even
to
you
)
as
if
the
Marshalsea
must
be
behind
that
great
rock
;
or
as
if
Mrs
Clennam
's
room
where
I
have
worked
so
many
days
,
and
where
I
first
saw
you
,
must
be
just
beyond
that
snow
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
one
night
when
I
came
with
Maggy
to
your
lodging
in
Covent
Garden
?
<EOS>
That
room
I
have
often
and
often
fancied
I
have
seen
before
me
,
travelling
along
for
miles
by
the
side
of
our
carriage
,
when
I
have
looked
out
of
the
carriage
-
window
after
dark
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
shut
out
that
night
,
and
sat
at
the
iron
gate
,
and
walked
about
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
look
up
at
the
stars
,
even
from
the
balcony
of
this
room
,
and
believe
that
I
am
in
the
street
again
,
shut
out
with
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
same
with
people
that
I
left
in
England
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
go
about
here
in
a
gondola
,
I
surprise
myself
looking
into
other
gondolas
as
if
I
hoped
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
overcome
me
with
joy
to
see
them
,
but
I
do
n't
think
it
would
surprise
me
much
,
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
fanciful
times
,
I
fancy
that
they
might
be
anywhere
;
and
I
almost
expect
to
see
their
dear
faces
on
the
bridges
or
the
quays
.
   
<EOS>
Another
difficulty
that
I
have
will
seem
very
strange
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
seem
very
strange
to
any
one
but
me
,
and
does
even
to
me
:
I
often
feel
the
old
sad
pity
for
---
I
need
not
write
the
word
---
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Changed
as
he
is
,
and
inexpressibly
blest
and
thankful
as
I
always
am
to
know
it
,
the
old
sorrowful
feeling
of
compassion
comes
upon
me
sometimes
with
such
strength
that
I
want
to
put
my
arms
<EOS>
round
his
neck
,
tell
him
how
I
love
him
,
and
cry
a
little
on
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
after
that
,
and
proud
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
that
I
must
not
do
this
;
that
he
would
not
like
it
,
that
Fanny
would
be
angry
,
that
Mrs
General
would
be
amazed
;
and
so
I
quiet
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
in
doing
so
,
I
struggle
with
the
feeling
that
I
have
come
to
be
at
a
distance
from
him
;
and
that
even
in
the
midst
of
all
the
servants
and
attendants
,
he
is
deserted
,
and
in
want
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Clennam
,
I
have
written
a
great
deal
about
myself
,
but
I
must
write
a
little
more
still
,
or
what
I
wanted
most
of
all
to
say
in
this
weak
letter
would
be
left
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
these
foolish
thoughts
of
mine
,
which
I
have
been
so
hardy
as
to
confess
to
you
because
I
know
you
will
understand
me
if
anybody
can
,
and
will
make
more
allowance
for
me
than
anybody
else
<EOS>
would
if
you
can
not
---
in
all
these
thoughts
,
there
is
one
thought
scarcely
ever
---
never
---
out
of
my
memory
,
and
that
is
that
I
hope
you
sometimes
,
in
a
quiet
moment
,
have
a
thought
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
that
as
to
this
,
I
have
felt
,
ever
since
I
have
been
away
,
an
anxiety
which
I
am
very
anxious
to
relieve
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
afraid
that
you
may
think
of
me
in
a
new
light
,
or
a
new
character
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
do
that
,
I
could
not
bear
that
---
it
would
make
me
more
unhappy
than
you
can
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
break
my
heart
to
believe
that
you
thought
of
me
in
any
way
that
would
make
me
stranger
to
you
than
I
was
when
you
were
so
good
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
to
pray
and
entreat
of
you
is
,
that
you
will
never
think
of
me
as
the
daughter
of
a
rich
person
;
that
you
will
never
think
of
me
as
dressing
any
better
,
or
living
any
better
,
than
when
you
first
knew
me
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
will
remember
me
only
as
the
little
shabby
girl
you
protected
with
so
much
tenderness
,
from
whose
threadbare
dress
you
have
kept
away
the
rain
,
and
whose
wet
feet
you
have
dried
at
your
fire
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
will
think
of
me
(
when
you
think
of
me
at
all
)
,
and
of
my
true
affection
and
devoted
gratitude
,
always
without
change
,
as
of
your
poor
child

Something
Wrong
<EOS>
Somewhere
 
<EOS>
The
family
had
been
a
month
or
two
at
Venice
,
when
Mr
Dorrit
,
who
was
much
among
Counts
and
Marquises
,
and
had
but
scant
leisure
,
set
an
hour
of
one
day
apart
,
beforehand
,
for
the
purpose
of
holding
some
conference
with
Mrs
General
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
he
had
reserved
in
his
mind
arriving
,
he
sent
Mr
Tinkler
,
his
valet
,
to
Mrs
General
's
apartment
(
which
would
have
absorbed
about
a
third
of
the
area
of
the
Marshalsea
)
,
to
present
his
compliments
to
that
lady
,
and
represent
him
as
desiring
the
favour
of
an
interview
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
that
period
of
the
forenoon
when
the
various
members
of
the
family
had
coffee
in
their
own
chambers
,
some
couple
of
hours
before
assembling
at
breakfast
in
a
faded
hall
which
had
once
been
sumptuous
,
but
was
now
the
prey
of
watery
vapours
and
a
settled
melancholy
,
Mrs
General
was
accessible
to
the
valet
.
 
<EOS>
That
envoy
found
her
on
a
little
square
of
carpet
,
so
extremely
diminutive
in
reference
to
the
size
of
her
stone
and
marble
floor
that
she
looked
as
if
she
might
have
had
it
spread
for
the
trying
on
of
a
ready
-
made
pair
of
shoes
;
or
as
if
she
had
come
into
possession
of
the
enchanted
piece
of
carpet
,
bought
for
forty
purses
by
one
of
the
three
princes
in
the
Arabian
Nights
,
and
had
that
moment
been
transported
on
it
,
at
a
wish
,
into
a
palatial
saloon
with
which
it
had
no
connection
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
,
replying
to
the
envoy
,
as
she
set
down
her
empty
coffee
-
cup
,
that
she
was
willing
at
once
to
proceed
to
Mr
Dorrit
's
apartment
,
and
spare
him
the
trouble
of
coming
to
her
(
which
,
in
his
gallantry
,
he
had
proposed
)
,
the
envoy
threw
open
the
door
,
and
escorted
Mrs
General
to
the
presence
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
a
walk
,
by
mysterious
staircases
and
corridors
,
from
Mrs
General
's
apartment
,
 
---
hoodwinked
by
a
narrow
side
street
with
a
low
gloomy
bridge
in
it
,
and
dungeon
-
like
opposite
tenements
,
their
walls
besmeared
with
a
thousand
downward
stains
and
streaks
,
as
if
every
crazy
aperture
in
them
had
been
weeping
tears
of
rust
into
the
Adriatic
for
centuries
---
to
Mr
Dorrit
's
apartment
:
with
a
whole
English
house
-
front
of
window
,
a
prospect
of
beautiful
church
-
domes
rising
into
the
blue
sky
sheer
out
of
the
water
which
reflected
them
,
and
a
hushed
murmur
of
the
Grand
Canal
laving
the
doorways
below
,
where
his
gondolas
and
gondoliers
attended
his
pleasure
,
drowsily
swinging
in
a
little
forest
of
piles
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
in
a
resplendent
dressing
-
gown
and
cap
---
the
dormant
grub
that
had
so
long
bided
its
time
among
the
Collegians
had
burst
into
a
rare
butterfly
---
rose
to
receive
Mrs
General
.
 
<EOS>
A
chair
to
Mrs
General
.
 
<EOS>
An
easier
chair
<EOS>
,
sir
;
what
are
you
doing
,
what
are
you
about
,
what
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
leave
us
!
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
General
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
I
took
the
liberty
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
,
"
Mrs
General
interposed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
quite
at
your
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
had
my
coffee
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
---
I
took
the
liberty
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
again
,
with
the
magnificent
placidity
of
one
who
was
above
correction
,
"
to
solicit
the
favour
of
a
little
private
conversation
with
you
,
because
I
feel
rather
worried
respecting
my
---
ha
---
my
younger
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
have
observed
a
great
difference
of
temperament
,
madam
,
between
my
two
daughters
?
"
   
<EOS>
Said
Mrs
General
in
response
,
crossing
her
gloved
hands
(
she
was
never
without
gloves
,
and
they
never
creased
and
always
fitted
)
,
"
There
is
a
great
difference
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
to
be
favoured
with
your
view
of
it
?
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
with
a
deference
not
incompatible
with
majestic
serenity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
returned
Mrs
General
,
"
has
force
of
character
and
self
-
reliance
.
<EOS>
Amy
,
none
.
"
   
<EOS>
None
?
 
<EOS>
O
Mrs
General
,
ask
the
Marshalsea
stones
and
bars
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mrs
General
,
ask
the
milliner
who
taught
her
to
work
,
and
the
dancing
-
master
who
taught
her
sister
to
dance
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mrs
General
,
Mrs
General
,
ask
me
,
her
father
,
<EOS>
what
I
owe
her
;
and
hear
my
testimony
touching
the
life
of
this
slighted
little
creature
from
her
childhood
up
!
   
<EOS>
No
such
adjuration
entered
Mr.
 
Dorrit
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Mrs
General
,
seated
in
her
usual
erect
attitude
on
her
coach
-
box
behind
the
proprieties
,
and
he
said
in
a
thoughtful
manner
,
"
True
,
madam
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
,
"
said
Mrs
General
,
"
be
understood
to
say
,
observe
,
that
there
is
nothing
to
improve
in
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
material
there
---
<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
a
little
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
kind
enough
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
to
be
---
ha
---
more
explicit
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
understand
my
elder
daughter
's
having
---
<EOS>
hum
---
too
much
material
.
 
<EOS>
What
material
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
returned
Mrs
General
,
"
at
present
forms
too
many
opinions
.
   
<EOS>
Perfect
breeding
forms
none
,
and
is
never
demonstrative
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Lest
he
himself
should
be
found
deficient
in
perfect
breeding
,
Mr
Dorrit
hastened
to
reply
,
"
Unquestionably
,
madam
,
you
are
right
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs
General
returned
,
in
her
emotionless
and
expressionless
manner
,
"
I
believe
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
aware
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
that
my
daughters
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
their
lamented
mother
when
they
were
very
young
;
and
that
,
in
consequence
of
my
not
having
been
until
lately
the
recognised
heir
to
my
property
,
they
have
lived
with
me
as
a
comparatively
poor
,
though
always
proud
,
gentleman
,
in
---
ha
hum
---
retirement
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
said
Mrs
General
,
"
lose
sight
of
the
circumstance
.
"
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
pursued
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
of
my
daughter
Fanny
,
under
her
present
guidance
and
with
such
an
example
constantly
before
her
---
"
   
<EOS>
(
Mrs
General
shut
her
eyes
.
)
    
<EOS>
---
"
I
have
no
misgivings
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
adaptability
of
character
in
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
younger
daughter
,
Mrs
General
,
rather
worries
and
vexes
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
inform
you
that
she
has
always
been
my
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
accounting
,
"
said
Mrs
General
,
"
for
these
partialities
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
---
no
,
"
assented
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
madam
,
I
am
troubled
by
noticing
that
Amy
is
not
,
so
to
speak
,
one
of
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
She
does
not
Care
to
go
about
with
us
;
she
is
lost
in
the
society
we
have
here
;
our
tastes
are
evidently
not
her
tastes
.
 
<EOS>
Which
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
summing
up
with
judicial
gravity
,
"
is
to
say
,
in
other
words
,
that
there
is
something
wrong
in
---
ha
---
Amy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
we
incline
to
the
supposition
,
"
said
Mrs
General
,
with
a
little
touch
of
varnish
,
"
that
something
is
referable
to
the
novelty
of
the
position
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
madam
,
"
observed
Mr
Dorrit
,
rather
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
daughter
of
a
gentleman
,
though
---
ha
---
himself
at
one
time
comparatively
far
from
affluent
---
comparatively
---
and
herself
reared
in
---
hum
---
retirement
,
need
not
of
necessity
find
this
position
so
very
novel
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
said
Mrs
General
,
"
true
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
I
took
the
liberty
"
<EOS>
(
he
laid
an
emphasis
on
the
phrase
and
repeated
it
,
as
though
he
stipulated
,
with
urbane
firmness
,
that
he
must
not
be
contradicted
again
)
<EOS>
,
"
I
took
the
liberty
of
requesting
this
interview
,
in
order
that
I
might
mention
the
topic
to
you
,
and
inquire
how
you
would
advise
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
returned
Mrs
General
,
"
I
have
conversed
with
Amy
several
times
since
we
have
been
residing
here
,
on
the
general
subject
of
the
formation
of
a
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
expressed
herself
to
me
as
wondering
exceedingly
at
Venice
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
mentioned
to
her
that
it
is
better
not
to
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
pointed
out
to
her
that
the
celebrated
Mr
Eustace
,
the
classical
tourist
,
did
not
think
much
of
it
;
and
that
he
compared
the
Rialto
,
greatly
to
its
disadvantage
,
with
Westminster
and
Blackfriars
Bridges
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
add
,
after
what
you
have
said
,
that
I
have
not
yet
found
my
arguments
successful
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
me
the
honour
to
ask
me
what
to
advise
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
appears
to
me
(
if
this
should
prove
to
be
a
baseless
assumption
,
I
shall
be
pardoned
)
,
that
Mr
Dorrit
has
been
accustomed
to
exercise
influence
over
the
minds
of
others
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hum
---
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
I
have
been
at
the
head
of
---
ha
of
a
considerable
community
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
right
in
supposing
that
I
am
not
unaccustomed
to
---
an
influential
position
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
,
"
returned
Mrs
General
,
"
to
be
so
corroborated
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
therefore
the
more
confidently
recommend
that
Mr
Dorrit
should
speak
to
Amy
himself
,
and
make
his
observations
and
wishes
known
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Being
his
favourite
,
besides
,
and
no
doubt
attached
to
him
,
she
is
all
the
more
likely
to
yield
to
his
influence
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
anticipated
your
suggestion
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
<EOS>
but
---
ha
---
was
not
sure
that
I
might
---
hum
---
not
encroach
on
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
my
province
,
Mr
Dorrit
?
"
said
Mrs
General
,
graciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
mention
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
with
your
leave
,
madam
,
"
resumed
Mr
Dorrit
,
ringing
his
little
bell
to
summon
his
valet
,
"
I
will
send
for
her
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
Mr
Dorrit
wish
me
to
remain
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
if
you
have
no
other
engagement
,
you
would
not
object
for
a
minute
or
two
---
"
   
"
Not
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
Tinkler
the
valet
was
instructed
to
find
Miss
Amy
's
maid
,
and
to
request
that
subordinate
to
inform
Miss
Amy
that
Mr
Dorrit
wished
to
see
her
in
his
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
In
delivering
this
charge
to
Tinkler
,
Mr
Dorrit
looked
severely
at
him
,
and
also
kept
a
jealous
eye
upon
him
until
he
went
out
at
the
door
,
mistrusting
that
he
might
have
something
in
his
mind
prejudicial
to
the
family
dignity
;
that
he
might
have
even
got
wind
of
some
Collegiate
joke
before
he
came
into
the
service
,
and
might
be
derisively
reviving
its
remembrance
at
the
present
moment
.
 
<EOS>
If
Tinkler
had
happened
to
smile
,
however
faintly
and
innocently
,
nothing
would
have
persuaded
Mr
Dorrit
,
to
the
hour
of
his
death
,
but
that
this
was
the
case
.
<EOS>
As
Tinkler
happened
,
however
,
very
fortunately
for
himself
,
to
be
of
a
serious
and
composed
countenance
,
he
escaped
the
secret
danger
that
threatened
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
on
his
return
---
when
Mr
Dorrit
eyed
him
again
---
he
announced
Miss
Amy
as
if
she
had
come
to
a
funeral
,
he
left
a
vague
impression
on
Mr
Dorrit
's
mind
that
he
was
a
well
-
conducted
young
fellow
,
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
study
of
his
Catechism
by
a
widowed
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
you
have
just
now
been
the
subject
of
some
conversation
between
myself
and
Mrs
General
.
 
<EOS>
We
agree
that
you
scarcely
seem
at
home
here
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
---
how
is
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
father
,
I
require
a
little
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Papa
is
a
preferable
mode
of
address
,
"
observed
Mrs
General
.
<EOS>
"
Father
is
rather
vulgar
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
Papa
,
besides
,
gives
a
pretty
form
to
the
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
,
potatoes
,
poultry
,
prunes
,
and
prism
are
all
very
good
words
for
the
lips
:
especially
prunes
and
prism
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
find
it
serviceable
,
in
the
formation
of
a
demeanour
,
if
you
sometimes
say
to
yourself
in
company
---
on
entering
a
room
,
for
instance
---
Papa
,
potatoes
,
poultry
,
prunes
and
prism
,
prunes
and
prism
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
my
child
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
attend
to
the
---
hum
---
precepts
of
Mrs
General
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Little
Dorrit
,
with
a
rather
forlorn
glance
at
that
eminent
varnisher
,
promised
to
try
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
say
,
Amy
,
"
pursued
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
that
you
think
you
require
time
.
 
<EOS>
Time
for
what
?
"
   
<EOS>
Another
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
become
accustomed
to
the
novelty
of
my
life
,
was
all
I
meant
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
with
her
loving
eyes
upon
her
father
;
whom
she
had
very
nearly
addressed
as
poultry
,
if
not
prunes
and
prism
too
,
in
her
desire
to
submit
herself
to
Mrs
General
and
please
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
frowned
,
and
looked
anything
but
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
"
he
returned
,
"
it
appears
to
me
,
I
must
say
,
that
you
have
had
abundance
of
time
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
---
you
surprise
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
disappoint
me
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
has
conquered
any
such
little
difficulties
,
and
---
hum
---
why
not
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
do
better
soon
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
returned
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
ha
---
I
most
devoutly
hope
so
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
for
you
,
in
order
that
I
might
say
---
hum
---
impressively
say
,
in
the
presence
of
Mrs
General
,
to
whom
we
are
all
so
much
indebted
for
obligingly
being
present
among
us
,
on
---
ha
---
on
this
or
any
other
occasion
,
"
Mrs
General
shut
her
eyes
,
"
that
I
---
ha
hum
---
am
not
pleased
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
make
Mrs
General
's
a
thankless
task
.
<EOS>
You
---
ha
---
embarrass
me
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
always
(
as
I
have
informed
Mrs
General
)
<EOS>
been
my
favourite
child
;
I
have
always
made
you
a
---
hum
---
a
friend
and
companion
;
in
return
,
I
beg
---
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
ha
---
I
do
beg
,
that
you
accommodate
yourself
better
to
 
---
hum
---
circumstances
,
and
dutifully
do
what
becomes
your
---
your
station
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
was
even
a
little
more
fragmentary
than
usual
,
being
excited
on
the
subject
and
anxious
to
make
himself
particularly
emphatic
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
beg
,
"
he
repeated
,
"
that
this
may
be
attended
to
,
and
that
you
will
seriously
take
pains
and
try
to
conduct
yourself
in
a
manner
both
becoming
your
position
as
---
ha
---
Miss
Amy
Dorrit
,
and
satisfactory
to
myself
and
Mrs
General
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
lady
shut
her
eyes
again
,
on
being
again
referred
to
;
then
,
slowly
opening
them
and
rising
,
added
these
words
:
"
<EOS>
If
Miss
Amy
Dorrit
will
direct
her
own
attention
to
,
and
will
accept
of
my
poor
assistance
in
,
the
formation
of
a
surface
,
Mr.
Dorrit
will
have
no
further
cause
of
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
take
this
opportunity
of
remarking
,
as
an
instance
in
point
,
that
it
is
scarcely
delicate
to
look
at
vagrants
with
the
attention
which
I
have
seen
bestowed
upon
them
by
a
very
dear
young
friend
of
mine
?
<EOS>
They
should
not
be
looked
at
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
disagreeable
should
ever
be
looked
at
.
 
<EOS>
Apart
from
such
a
habit
standing
in
the
way
of
that
graceful
equanimity
of
surface
which
is
so
expressive
of
good
breeding
,
it
hardly
seems
compatible
with
refinement
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
A
truly
refined
mind
will
seem
to
be
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
anything
that
is
not
perfectly
proper
,
placid
,
and
pleasant
.
"
<EOS>
Having
delivered
this
exalted
sentiment
,
Mrs
General
made
a
sweeping
obeisance
,
and
retired
with
an
expression
of
mouth
indicative
of
Prunes
and
Prism
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
whether
speaking
or
silent
,
had
preserved
her
quiet
earnestness
and
her
loving
look
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
clouded
,
except
for
a
passing
moment
,
until
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
that
she
was
left
alone
with
him
the
fingers
of
her
lightly
folded
hands
were
agitated
,
and
there
was
repressed
emotion
in
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
Not
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
feel
a
little
wounded
,
but
her
care
was
not
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Her
thoughts
still
turned
,
as
they
always
had
turned
,
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
faint
misgiving
,
which
had
hung
about
her
since
their
accession
to
fortune
,
that
even
now
she
could
never
see
him
as
he
used
to
be
before
the
prison
days
,
had
gradually
begun
to
assume
form
in
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
that
,
in
what
he
had
just
now
said
to
her
and
in
his
whole
bearing
towards
her
,
there
was
the
well
-
known
shadow
of
the
Marshalsea
wall
.
 
<EOS>
It
took
a
new
shape
,
but
it
was
the
old
sad
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
She
began
with
sorrowful
unwillingness
to
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
keep
off
the
fear
that
no
space
in
the
life
of
man
could
overcome
that
quarter
of
a
century
behind
the
prison
bars
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
blame
to
bestow
upon
him
,
therefore
:
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
,
no
emotions
in
her
faithful
heart
but
great
compassion
and
unbounded
tenderness
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
why
it
was
,
that
,
even
as
he
sat
before
her
on
his
sofa
,
in
the
brilliant
light
of
a
bright
Italian
day
,
the
wonderful
city
without
and
the
splendours
of
an
old
palace
within
,
she
saw
him
at
the
moment
in
the
long
-
familiar
gloom
of
his
Marshalsea
lodging
,
and
wished
to
take
her
seat
beside
him
,
and
comfort
him
,
and
be
again
full
of
confidence
with
him
,
and
of
usefulness
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
divined
what
was
in
her
thoughts
,
his
own
were
not
in
tune
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
After
some
uneasy
moving
in
his
seat
,
he
got
up
and
walked
about
,
looking
very
much
dissatisfied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
else
you
wish
to
say
to
me
,
dear
father
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
 
Nothing
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
you
have
not
been
pleased
with
me
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
think
of
me
with
displeasure
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
try
,
more
than
ever
,
to
adapt
myself
as
you
wish
to
what
surrounds
me
 
---
<EOS>
for
indeed
I
have
tried
all
along
,
though
I
have
failed
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
"
he
returned
,
turning
short
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
---
ha
---
habitually
hurt
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hurt
you
,
father
!
 
<EOS>
I
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
---
hum
---
a
topic
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
looking
all
about
the
ceiling
of
the
room
,
and
never
at
the
attentive
,
uncomplainingly
shocked
face
,
"
a
painful
topic
,
a
series
of
events
which
I
wish
 
---
ha
---
altogether
to
obliterate
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
understood
by
your
sister
,
who
has
already
remonstrated
with
you
in
my
presence
;
it
is
understood
by
your
brother
;
it
is
understood
by
---
ha
hum
---
by
every
one
of
delicacy
and
sensitiveness
except
yourself
---
ha
---
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
except
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
,
Amy
---
hum
---
you
alone
and
only
you
 
---
constantly
revive
the
topic
,
though
not
in
words
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
She
gently
touched
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
trembling
hand
may
have
said
,
with
some
expression
,
"
Think
of
me
,
think
how
I
have
worked
,
think
of
my
many
cares
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
she
said
not
a
syllable
herself
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
reproach
in
the
touch
so
addressed
to
him
that
she
had
not
foreseen
,
or
she
would
have
withheld
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
justify
himself
in
a
heated
,
stumbling
,
angry
manner
,
which
made
nothing
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
there
all
those
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
---
ha
---
universally
acknowledged
as
the
head
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
hum
<EOS>
---
I
caused
you
to
be
respected
there
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
ha
hum
---
I
gave
my
family
a
position
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
deserve
a
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
claim
a
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
sweep
it
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
begin
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
much
?
 
<EOS>
I
ask
,
is
that
much
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
once
look
at
her
,
as
he
rambled
on
in
this
way
;
but
gesticulated
at
,
and
appealed
to
,
the
empty
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
suffered
.
 
<EOS>
Probably
I
know
how
much
I
have
suffered
better
than
any
one
---
ha
---
I
say
than
any
one
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
can
put
that
aside
,
if
I
can
eradicate
the
marks
of
what
I
have
endured
,
and
can
emerge
before
the
world
---
a
---
ha
---
gentleman
unspoiled
,
unspotted
 
---
is
it
a
great
deal
to
expect
---
I
say
again
,
is
it
a
great
deal
to
expect
---
that
my
children
should
---
hum
---
do
the
same
and
sweep
that
accursed
experience
off
the
face
of
the
earth
?
"
   
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
flustered
state
,
he
made
all
these
exclamations
in
a
carefully
suppressed
voice
,
lest
the
valet
should
overhear
anything
.
   
<EOS>
"
Accordingly
,
they
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Your
sister
does
it
.
 
<EOS>
Your
brother
does
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
alone
,
my
favourite
child
,
whom
I
made
the
friend
and
companion
of
my
life
when
you
were
a
mere
---
hum
---
Baby
,
do
not
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
You
alone
say
you
ca
n't
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
provide
you
with
valuable
assistance
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
attach
an
accomplished
and
highly
bred
lady
 
---
ha
---
Mrs
General
,
to
you
,
for
the
purpose
of
doing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
surprising
that
I
should
be
displeased
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
necessary
that
I
should
defend
myself
for
expressing
my
displeasure
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
which
,
he
continued
to
defend
himself
,
without
any
abatement
of
his
flushed
mood
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
careful
to
appeal
to
that
lady
for
confirmation
,
before
I
express
any
displeasure
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
hum
<EOS>
---
I
necessarily
make
that
appeal
within
limited
bounds
,
or
I
---
ha
---
should
render
legible
,
by
that
lady
,
what
I
desire
to
be
blotted
out
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
selfish
?
 
<EOS>
Do
I
complain
for
my

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Principally
for

your
sake

Amy

"
   
<EOS>
This
last
consideration
plainly
appeared
,
from
his
manner
of
pursuing
it
,
to
have
just
that
instant
come
into
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
I
was
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
---
ha
---
am
determined
to
be
,
whatever
is
advanced
to
the
contrary

<EOS>
I
am
hurt
that
my
daughter
,
seated
in
the
---
hum

lap
of
fortune
,
should
mope
and
retire
and
proclaim
herself
unequal
to
her
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
hurt
that
she
should
 
<EOS>

systematically
reproduce
what
the

us
blot
out

society

bred
in

a
place

I
myself
decline
to
name

But
there
is
no
inconsistency

not
the

,
in
my
feeling
hurt
,
and
yet
complaining
principally
for
your
sake

Amy

<EOS>
I
do
;
I
say
again
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
for
your
sake
that
I
wish
you
,
under
the
auspices
of
Mrs
General
,
to
form
a

a
surface

<EOS>
It
is
for
your
sake
that
I
wish
you
to
have
a

truly
refined
mind
,

(
in
the
striking
words
of
Mrs

)
to

"
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
running
down
by
jerks
,
during
his
last
speech
,
like
a
sort
of
ill
-
adjusted
alarum
.
 
<EOS>
The
touch
was
still
upon
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
silent
;
and
after
looking
about
the
ceiling
again
for
a
little
while
,
looked
down
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
head
drooped
,
and
he
could
not
see
her
face
;
but
her
touch
was
tender
and
quiet
,
and
in
the
expression
of
her
dejected
figure
there
was
no
blame
---
nothing
but
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
whimper
,
just
as
he
had
done
that
night
in
the
prison
when
she
afterwards
sat
at
his
bedside
till
morning
;
exclaimed
that
he
was
a
poor
ruin
and
a
poor
wretch
in
the
midst
of
his
wealth
;
and
clasped
her
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
,
my
own
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Kiss
me
!
<EOS>
"
was
all
she
said
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
tears
were
soon
dried
,
much
sooner
than
on
the
former
occasion
;
and
he
was
presently
afterwards
very
high
with
his
valet
,
as
a
way
of
righting
himself
for
having
shed
any
.
   
<EOS>
With
one
remarkable
exception
,
to
be
recorded
in
its
place
,
this
was
the
only
time
,
in
his
life
of
freedom
and
fortune
,
when
he
spoke
to
his
daughter
Amy
of
the
old
days
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
now
,
the
breakfast
hour
arrived
;
and
<EOS>
with
it
Miss
Fanny
from
her
apartment
,
and
Mr
Edward
from
his
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
Both
these
young
persons
of
distinction
were
something
the
worse
for
late
hours
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Miss
Fanny
,
she
had
become
the
victim
of
an
insatiate
mania
for
what
she
called
"
going
into
society
;
"
and
would
have
gone
into
it
head
-
foremost
fifty
times
between
sunset
and
sunrise
,
if
so
many
opportunities
had
been
at
her
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Edward
,
he
,
too
,
had
a
large
acquaintance
,
and
was
generally
engaged
(
for
the
most
part
,
in
diceing
circles
,
or
others
of
a
kindred
nature
)
,
during
the
greater
part
of
every
night
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
gentleman
,
when
his
fortunes
changed
,
had
stood
at
the
great
advantage
of
being
already
prepared
for
the
highest
associates
,
and
having
little
to
learn
:
so
much
was
he
indebted
to
the
happy
accidents
which
had
made
him
acquainted
with
horse
-
dealing
and
billiard
-
marking
.
   
<EOS>
At
breakfast
,
Mr
Frederick
Dorrit
likewise
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
old
gentleman
inhabited
the
highest
story
of
the
palace
,
where
he
might
have
practised
pistol
-
shooting
without
much
chance
of
discovery
by
the
other
inmates
,
his
younger
niece
had
taken
courage
to
propose
the
restoration
to
him
of
his
clarionet
,
which
Mr
Dorrit
had
ordered
to
be
confiscated
,
but
which
she
had
ventured
to
preserve
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
some
objections
from
Miss
Fanny
,
that
it
was
a
low
instrument
,
and
that
she
detested
the
sound
of
it
,
the
concession
had
been
made
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
then
discovered
that
he
had
had
enough
of
it
,
and
never
played
it
,
now
that
it
was
no
longer
his
means
of
getting
bread
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
insensibly
acquired
a
new
habit
of
shuffling
into
the
picture
-
galleries
,
always
with
his
twisted
paper
of
snuff
in
his
hand
(
much
to
the
indignation
of
Miss
Fanny
,
who
had
proposed
the
purchase
of
a
gold
box
for
him
that
the
family
might
not
be
discredited
,
which
he
had
absolutely
refused
to
carry
when
it
was
bought
)
;
and
of
passing
hours
and
hours
before
the
portraits
of
renowned
Venetians
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
never
made
out
what
his
dazed
eyes
saw
in
them
;
whether
he
had
an
interest
in
them
merely
as
pictures
,
or
whether
he
confusedly
identified
them
with
a
glory
that
was
departed
,
like
the
strength
of
his
own
mind
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
paid
his
court
to
them
with
great
exactness
,
and
clearly
derived
pleasure
from
the
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
first
few
days
,
Little
Dorrit
happened
one
morning
to
assist
at
these
attentions
.
 
<EOS>
It
so
evidently
heightened
his
gratification
that
she
often
accompanied
him
afterwards
,
and
the
greatest
delight
of
which
the
old
man
had
shown
himself
susceptible
since
his
ruin
,
arose
out
of
these
excursions
,
when
he
would
carry
a
chair
about
for
her
from
picture
to
picture
,
and
stand
behind
it
,
in
spite
of
all
her
remonstrances
,
silently
presenting
her
to
the
noble
Venetians
.
   
<EOS>
It
fell
out
that
,
at
this
family
breakfast
,
he
referred
to
their
having
seen
in
a
gallery
,
on
the
previous
day
,
the
lady
and
gentleman
whom
they
had
encountered
on
the
Great
Saint
Bernard
,
"
I
forget
the
name
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
remember
them
,
William
?
   
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
do
,
Edward
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
remember
'em
well
enough
,
"
said
the
latter
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
observed
Miss
Fanny
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
a
glance
at
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
they
would
not
have
been
recalled
to
our
remembrance
,
I
suspect
,
if
Uncle
had
n't
tumbled
over
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
what
a
curious
phrase
,
"
said
Mrs
General
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
not
inadvertently
lighted
upon
,
or
accidentally
referred
to
,
be
better
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
very
much
,
Mrs
General
,
"
returned
the
young
lady
,
no
)
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
I
prefer
my
own
expression
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
always
Miss
Fanny
's
way
of
receiving
a
suggestion
from
Mrs
General
.
<EOS>
But
she
always
stored
it
up
in
her
mind
,
and
adopted
it
at
another
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
mentioned
our
having
met
Mr
and
Mrs
Gowan
,
Fanny
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
even
if
Uncle
had
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
seen
you
since
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
meant
to
have
spoken
of
it
at
breakfast
;
because
I
should
like
to
pay
a
visit
to
Mrs
Gowan
,
and
to
become
better
acquainted
with
her
,
if
Papa
and
Mrs
General
do
not
object
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Amy
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
I
am
sure
I
am
glad
to
find
you
at
last
expressing
a
wish
to
become
better
acquainted
with
anybody
in
Venice
.
 
<EOS>
Though
whether
Mr
and
Mrs
Gowan
are
desirable
acquaintances
,
remains
to
be
determined
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Gowan
<EOS>
I
spoke
of
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
ca
n't
separate
her
from
her
husband
,
I
believe
,
without
an
Act
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
Papa
,
"
inquired
Little
Dorrit
,
with
diffidence
and
hesitation
,
"
there
is
any
objection
to
my
making
this
visit
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
he
replied
,
"
I
---
ha
---
<EOS>
what
is
Mrs
General
's
view
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
's
view
was
,
that
not
having
the
honour
of
any
acquaintance
with
the
lady
and
gentleman
referred
to
,
she
was
not
in
a
position
to
varnish
the
present
article
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
only
remark
,
as
a
general
principle
observed
in
the
varnishing
trade
,
that
much
depended
on
the
quarter
from
which
the
lady
under
consideration
was
accredited
to
a
family
so
conspicuously
niched
in
the
social
temple
as
the
family
of
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
remark
the
face
of
Mr
Dorrit
gloomed
considerably
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
about
(
connecting
the
accrediting
with
an
obtrusive
person
of
the
name
of
Clennam
,
whom
he
imperfectly
remembered
in
some
former
state
of
existence
)
to
black
-
ball
the
name
of
Gowan
finally
,
when
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
came
into
the
conversation
,
with
his
glass
in
his
eye
,
and
the
preliminary
remark
of
"
I
say
---
you
there
!
 
<EOS>
Go
out
,
will
you
!
"
<EOS>
---
which
was
addressed
to
a
couple
of
men
who
were
handing
the
dishes
round
,
as
a
courteous
intimation
that
their
services
could
be
temporarily
dispensed
with
.
   
<EOS>
Those
menials
having
obeyed
the
mandate
,
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
proceeded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
's
a
matter
of
policy
to
let
you
all
know
that
these
Gowans
---
in
whose
favour
,
or
at
least
the
gentleman
's
,
I
ca
n't
be
supposed
to
be
much
prepossessed
myself
---
are
known
to
people
of
importance
,
if
that
makes
any
difference
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
I
would
say
,
"
observed
the
fair
varnisher
,
"
Makes
the
greatest
difference
.
 
<EOS>
The
connection
in
question
,
being
really
people
of
importance
and
consideration
---
"
   
"
As
to
that
,
"
said
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
"
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
the
means
of
judging
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
acquainted
,
perhaps
,
with
the
famous
name
of
Merdle
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
great
Merdle
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
General
.
   
<EOS>
"
THE
Merdle
,
"
said
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
known
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
---
I
mean
the
dowager
,
my
polite
friend
's
mother
 
---
is
intimate
with
Mrs
Merdle
,
and
I
know
these
two
to
be
on
their
visiting
list
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
so
,
a
more
undeniable
guarantee
could
not
be
given
,
"
said
Mrs
General
to
Mr
Dorrit
,
raising
her
gloves
and
bowing
her
head
,
as
if
she
were
doing
homage
to
some
visible
graven
image
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
ask
my
son
,
from
motives
of
---
ah
---
curiosity
,
"
Mr
Dorrit
observed
,
with
a
decided
change
in
his
manner
,
"
how
he
becomes
possessed
of
this
---
hum
---
timely
information
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
long
story
,
sir
,
"
returned
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
"
and
you
shall
have
it
out
of
hand
.
 
<EOS>
To
begin
with
,
Mrs
Merdle
is
the
lady
you
had
the
parley
with
at
what's
-
his
-
name
place
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Martigny
,
"
interposed
Miss
Fanny
with
an
air
of
infinite
languor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martigny
,
"
assented
her
brother
,
with
a
slight
nod
and
a
slight
wink
;
in
acknowledgment
of
which
,
Miss
Fanny
looked
surprised
,
and
laughed
and
reddened
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
that
be
,
Edward
?
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
informed
me
that
the
name
of
the
gentleman
with
whom
you
conferred
was
---
ha
---
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
you
showed
me
his
card
.
 
<EOS>
Hum
.
 
<EOS>
Sparkler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
father
;
but
it
does
n't
follow
that
his
mother
's
name
must
be
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
was
married
before
,
and
he
is
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
in
Rome
now
;
where
probably
we
shall
know
more
of
her
,
as
you
decide
to
winter
there
.
 
<EOS>
Sparkler
is
just
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
passed
last
evening
in
company
with
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
Sparkler
is
a
very
good
fellow
on
the
whole
,
though
rather
a
bore
on
one
subject
,
in
consequence
of
being
tremendously
smitten
with
a
certain
young
lady
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
eyed
Miss
Fanny
through
his
glass
across
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
happened
last
night
to
compare
notes
about
our
travels
,
and
I
had
the
information
I
have
given
you
from
Sparkler
himself
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
he
ceased
;
continuing
to
eye
Miss
Fanny
through
his
glass
,
with
a
face
much
twisted
,
and
not
ornamentally
so
,
in
part
by
the
action
of
keeping
his
glass
in
his
eye
,
and
in
part
by
the
great
subtlety
of
his
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Under
these
circumstances
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
I
believe
I
express
the
sentiments
of
---
ha
---
Mrs
General
,
no
less
than
my
own
,
when
I
say
that
there
is
no
objection
,
<EOS>
but
---
ha
hum
---
<EOS>
quite
the
contrary
---
to
your
gratifying
your
desire
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
<EOS>
I
may
---
ha
---
hail
---
<EOS>
this
desire
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
in
an
encouraging
and
forgiving
manner
,
"
as
an
auspicious
omen
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
quite
right
to
know
these
people
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
proper
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
's
is
a
name
of
---
ha
---
world
-
wide
repute
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
's
undertakings
are
immense
.
 
<EOS>
They
bring
him
in
such
vast
sums
of
money
that
they
are
regarded
as
---
hum
---
national
benefits
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
is
the
man
of
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
Merdle
is
the
name
of
the
age
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
everything
on
my
behalf
that
is
civil
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Gowan
,
for
we
will
---
ha
---
we
will
certainly
notice
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
magnificent
accordance
of
Mr
Dorrit
's
recognition
settled
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
observed
that
Uncle
had
pushed
away
his
plate
,
and
forgotten
his
breakfast
;
but
he
was
not
much
observed
at
any
time
,
except
by
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
The
servants
were
recalled
,
and
the
meal
proceeded
to
its
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
rose
and
left
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
rose
and
left
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
When
Edward
and
Fanny
remained
whispering
together
across
it
,
and
when
Mr
Dorrit
remained
eating
figs
and
reading
a
French
newspaper
,
Uncle
suddenly
fixed
the
attention
of
all
three
by
rising
out
of
his
chair
,
striking
his
hand
upon
the
table
,
and
saying
,
"
<EOS>
Brother
!
 
<EOS>
I
protest
against
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
If
he
had
made
a
proclamation
in
an
unknown
tongue
,
and
given
up
the
ghost
immediately
afterwards
,
he
could
not
have
astounded
his
audience
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
paper
fell
from
Mr
Dorrit
's
hand
,
and
he
sat
petrified
,
with
a
fig
half
way
to
his
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brother
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
man
,
conveying
a
surprising
energy
into
his
trembling
voice
,
"
I
protest
against
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
;
you
know
I
love
you
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
many
years
I
have
never
been
untrue
to
you
in
a
single
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Weak
as
I
am
,
I
would
at
any
time
have
struck
any
man
who
spoke
ill
of
you

<EOS>
But
,
brother

brother
,
brother
,
I
protest
against
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
extraordinary
to
see
of
what
a
burst
of
earnestness
<EOS>
such
a
decrepit
man
was
capable
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
became
bright
,
his
grey
hair
rose
on
his
head
,
markings
of
purpose
on
his
brow
and
face
which
had
faded
from
them
for
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
,
started
out
again
,
and
there
was
an
energy
in
his
hand
that
made
its
action
nervous
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Frederick
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Dorrit
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
wrong
?
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
turning
round
on
Fanny
,
"
<EOS>
how
dare
you
do
it
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
no
memory

<EOS>
Have
you
no
heart
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Uncle

<EOS>
"
cried
Fanny
,
affrighted
and
bursting
into
tears
,
"
why
do
you
attack
me
in
this
cruel
manner
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
?
"
   
"
Done
?
"
returned
the
old
man
,
pointing
to
her
sister
's
place
,
"
where
's
your
affectionate
invaluable
friend
?
 
<EOS>
Where
's
your
devoted
guardian

<EOS>
Where
's
your
more
than
mother
?
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
set
up
superiorities
against
all
these
characters
combined
in
your
sister
?
   
<EOS>
For
shame
,
you
false
girl
,
for
shame
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
love
Amy
,
"
cried
Miss
Fanny
,
sobbing
and
weeping
,
"
as
well
as
I
love
my
life
---
better
than
I
love
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
deserve
to
be
so
treated
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
grateful
to
Amy
,
and
as
fond
of
Amy
,
as
it
's
possible
for
any
human
being
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
wickedly
wronged
.
 
<EOS>
And
only
because
I
am
anxious
for
the
family
credit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
winds
with
the
family
credit
!
"
cried
the
old
man
,
with
great
scorn
and
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
I
protest
against
pride
.
<EOS>
I
protest
against
ingratitude
.
 
<EOS>
I
protest
against
any
one
of
us
here
who
have
known
what
we
have
known
,
and
have
seen
what
we
have
seen
,
setting
up
any
pretension
that
puts
Amy
at
a
moment
's
disadvantage
,
or
to
the
cost
of
a
moment
's
pain
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
know
that
it
's
a
base
pretension
by
its
having
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
It
ought
to
bring
a
judgment
on
us
.
 
<EOS>
Brother
,
I
protest
against
it
in
the
sight
of
God
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
his
hand
went
up
above
his
head
and
came
down
on
the
table
,
it
might
have
been
a
blacksmith
's
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
'
silence
,
it
had
relaxed
into
its
usual
weak
condition
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
round
to
his
brother
with
his
ordinary
shuffling
step
,
put
the
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
said
,
in
a
softened
voice
,
"
William
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
I
felt
obliged
to
say
it
;
forgive
me
,
for
I
felt
obliged
to
say
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
went
,
in
his
bowed
way
,
out
of
the
palace
hall
,
just
as
he
might
have
gone
out
of
the
Marshalsea
room
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
Fanny
had
been
sobbing
and
crying
,
and
still
continued
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
,
beyond
opening
his
mouth
in
amazement
,
had
not
opened
his
lips
,
and
had
done
nothing
but
stare
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
also
had
been
utterly
discomfited
,
and
quite
unable
to
assert
himself
in
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
was
now
the
first
to
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
never
,
never
was
so
used
!
"
<EOS>
she
sobbed
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
never
was
anything
so
harsh
and
unjustifiable
,
so
disgracefully
violent
and
cruel
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
kind
,
quiet
little
Amy
,
too
,
what
would
she
feel
if
she
could
know
that
she
had
been
innocently
the
means
of
exposing
me
to
such
treatment
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
never
tell
her
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
<EOS>
good
darling
,
I
'll
never
tell
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
helped
Mr
Dorrit
to
break
his
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
---
ha
---
approve
of
your
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be

much
better
not

this
to
Amy

It

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
No

it
would
distress
her
greatly

<EOS>
It
is
considerate
and
right
to
avoid
doing
so

<EOS>
We
will

keep
this
to

"
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
cruelty
of
Uncle

"
cried
Miss
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
,
I
never
can
forgive
the
wanton
cruelty
of
Uncle
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
recovering
his
tone
,
though
he
remained
unusually
pale
,
"
I
must
request
you
not
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
remember
that
your
uncle
is
---

not
what
he
formerly
was
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
remember
that
your

requires

great
forbearance
from
us
,
great
forbearance

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
cried
Fanny
,
piteously
,
"
it
is
only
charitable
to
suppose
that
there
Must
be
something
wrong
in
him
somewhere
,
or
he
never

have
so
attacked
Me

of

"
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
returned
Mr
Dorrit
in
a
deeply
fraternal
tone
,
"
you

with

"
   
<EOS>
This
ended
the
scene
;
Edward
Dorrit
,
Esquire
,
saying
nothing
throughout
,
but
looking
,
to
the
last
,
perplexed
and
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
awakened
much
affectionate
uneasiness
in
her
sister
's
mind
that
day
by
passing
the
greater
part
of
it
in
violent
fits
of
embracing
her
,
and
in
alternately
giving
her
brooches
,
and
wishing
herself
dead

<EOS>
Something
<EOS>
Right
<EOS>
Somewhere
 
To
be
in
the
halting
state
of
Mr
Henry
Gowan
;
to
have
left
one
of
two
powers
in
disgust
;
to
want
the
necessary
qualifications
for
finding
promotion
with
another
,
and
to
be
loitering
moodily
about
on
neutral
ground
,
cursing
both
;
is
to
be
in
a
situation
unwholesome
for
the
mind
,
<EOS>
which
time
is
not
likely
to
improve
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
class
of
sum
worked
in
the
every
-
day
world
is
cyphered
by
the
diseased
arithmeticians
who
are
always
in
the
rule
of
Subtraction
as
to
the
merits
and
successes
of
others
,
and
never
in
Addition
as
to
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
The
habit
,
too
,
of
seeking
some
sort
of
recompense
in
the
discontented
boast
of
being
disappointed
,
is
a
habit
fraught
with
degeneracy
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
idle
carelessness
and
recklessness
of
consistency
soon
comes
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
bring
deserving
things
down
by
setting
undeserving
things
up
is
one
of
its
perverted
delights
;
and
there
is
no
playing
fast
and
loose
with
the
truth
,
in
any
game
,
without
growing
the
worse
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
In
his
expressed
opinions
of
all
performances
in
the
Art
of
painting
that
were
completely
destitute
of
merit
,
Gowan
was
the
most
liberal
fellow
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
declare
such
a
man
to
have
more
power
in
his
little
finger
(
provided
he
had
none
)
,
than
such
another
had
(
provided
he
had
much
)
in
his
whole
mind
and
body
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
objection
were
taken
that
the
thing
commended
was
trash
,
he
would
reply
,
on
behalf
of
his
art
,
"
My
good
fellow
,
what
do
we
all
turn
out
but
trash
?
 
<EOS>
I
turn
out
nothing
else
,
and
I
make
you
a
present
of
the
confession
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
To
make
a
vaunt
of
being
poor
was
another
of
the
incidents
of
his
splenetic
state
,
though
this
may
have
had
the
design
in
it
of
showing
that
he
ought
to
be
rich
;
just
as
he
would
publicly
laud
and
decry
the
Barnacles
,
lest
it
should
be
forgotten
that
he
belonged
to
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
these
two
subjects
were
very
often
on
his
lips
;
and
he
managed
them
so
well
that
he
might
have
praised
himself
by
the
month
together
,
and
not
have
made
himself
out
half
so
important
a
man
as
he
did
by
his
light
disparagement
of
his
claims
on
anybody
's
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
Out
of
this
same
airy
talk
of
his
,
it
always
soon
came
to
be
understood
,
wherever
he
and
his
wife
went
,
that
he
had
married
against
the
wishes
of
his
exalted
relations
,
and
had
had
much
ado
to
prevail
on
them
to
countenance
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
made
the
representation
,
on
the
contrary
seemed
to
laugh
the
idea
to
scorn
;
but
it
did
happen
that
,
with
all
his
pains
to
depreciate
himself
,
he
was
always
in
the
superior
position
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
days
of
their
honeymoon
,
Minnie
Gowan
felt
sensible
of
being
usually
regarded
as
the
wife
of
a
man
who
had
made
a
descent
in
marrying
her
,
but
whose
chivalrous
love
for
her
had
cancelled
that
inequality
.
   
<EOS>
To
Venice
they
had
been
accompanied
by
Monsieur
Blandois
of
Paris
,
and
at
Venice
Monsieur
Blandois
of
Paris
was
very
much
in
the
society
of
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
first
met
this
gallant
gentleman
at
Geneva
,
Gowan
had
been
undecided
whether
to
kick
him
or
encourage
him
;
and
had
remained
for
about
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
,
so
troubled
to
settle
the
point
to
his
satisfaction
,
that
he
had
thought
of
tossing
up
a
five
-
franc
piece
on
the
terms
,
"
Tails
,
kick
;
heads
,
encourage
,
"
and
abiding
by
the
voice
of
the
oracle
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
,
however
,
that
his
wife
expressed
a
dislike
to
the
engaging
Blandois
,
and
that
the
balance
of
feeling
in
the
hotel
was
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
it
,
Gowan
resolved
to
encourage
him
.
   
<EOS>
Why
this
perversity
,
if
it
were
not
in
a
generous
fit
?
---
which
it
was
not
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
Gowan
,
very
much
the
superior
of
Blandois
of
Paris
,
and
very
well
able
to
pull
that
prepossessing
gentleman
to
pieces
and
find
out
the
stuff
he
was
made
of
,
take
up
with
such
a
man
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
opposed
the
first
separate
wish
he
observed
in
his
wife
,
because
her
father
had
paid
his
debts
and
it
was
desirable
to
take
an
early
opportunity
of
asserting
his
independence
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
he
opposed
the
prevalent
feeling
,
because
with
many
capacities
of
being
otherwise
,
he
was
an
ill
-
conditioned
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
a
pleasure
in
declaring
that
a
courtier
with
the
refined
manners
of
Blandois
ought
to
rise
to
the
greatest
distinction
in
any
polished
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
a
pleasure
in
setting
up
Blandois
as
the
type
of
elegance
,
and
making
him
a
satire
upon
others
who
piqued
themselves
on
personal
graces
.
 
<EOS>
He
seriously
protested
that
the
bow
of
Blandois
was
perfect
,
that
the
address
of
Blandois
was
irresistible
,
and
that
the
picturesque
ease
of
Blandois
would
be
cheaply
purchased
(
if
it
were
not
a
gift
,
and
unpurchasable
)
for
a
hundred
thousand
francs
.
 
<EOS>
That
exaggeration
in
the
manner
of
the
man
which
has
been
noticed
as
appertaining
to
him
and
to
every
such
man
,
whatever
his
original
breeding
,
as
certainly
as
the
sun
belongs
to
this
system
,
was
acceptable
to
Gowan
as
a
caricature
,
which
he
found
it
a
humorous
resource
to
have
at
hand
for
the
ridiculing
of
numbers
of
people
who
necessarily
did
more
or
less
of
what
Blandois
overdid
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
he
had
taken
up
with
him
;
and
thus
,
negligently
strengthening
these
inclinations
with
habit
,
and
idly
deriving
some
amusement
from
his
talk
,
he
had
glided
into
a
way
of
having
him
for
a
companion
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
though
he
supposed
him
to
live
by
his
wits
at
play
-
tables
and
the
like
;
though
he
suspected
him
to
be
a
coward
,
while
he
himself
was
daring
and
courageous
;
though
he
thoroughly
knew
him
to
be
disliked
by
Minnie
;
and
though
he
cared
so
little
for
him
,
after
all
,
that
if
he
had
given
her
any
tangible
personal
cause
to
regard
him
with
aversion
,
he
would
have
had
no
compunction
<EOS>
whatever
in
flinging
him
out
of
the
highest
window
in
Venice
into
the
deepest
water
of
the
city
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
would
have
been
glad
to
make
her
visit
to
Mrs
Gowan
,
alone
;
but
as
Fanny
,
who
had
not
yet
recovered
from
her
Uncle
's
protest
,
though
it
was
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
of
age
,
pressingly
offered
her
company
,
the
two
sisters
stepped
together
into
one
of
the
gondolas
under
Mr
Dorrit
's
window
,
and
,
with
the
courier
in
attendance
,
were
taken
in
high
state
to
Mrs
Gowan
's
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
In
truth
,
their
state
was
rather
too
high
for
the
lodging
,
which
was
,
as
Fanny
complained
,
"
fearfully
out
of
the
way
,
"
and
which
took
them
through
a
complexity
of
narrow
streets
of
water
,
which
the
same
lady
disparaged
as
"
mere
ditches
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
house
,
on
a
little
desert
island
,
looked
as
if
it
had
broken
away
from
somewhere
else
,
and
had
floated
by
chance
into
its
present
anchorage
in
company
with
a
vine
almost
as
much
in
want
of
training
as
the
poor
wretches
who
were
lying
under
its
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
The
features
of
the
surrounding
picture
were
,
a
church
with
hoarding
and
scaffolding
about
it
,
which
had
been
under
suppositious
repair
so
long
that
the
means
of
repair
looked
a
hundred
years
old
,
and
had
themselves
fallen
into
decay
;
a
quantity
of
washed
linen
,
spread
to
dry
in
the
sun
;
a
number
of
houses
at
odds
with
one
another
and
grotesquely
out
of
the
perpendicular
,
like
rotten
pre
-
Adamite
cheeses
cut
into
fantastic
shapes
and
full
of
mites
;
and
a
feverish
bewilderment
of
windows
,
with
their
lattice
-
blinds
all
hanging
askew
,
and
something
draggled
and
dirty
dangling
out
of
most
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
first
-
floor
of
the
house
was
a
Bank
---
a
surprising
experience
for
any
gentleman
of
commercial
pursuits
bringing
laws
for
all
mankind
from
a
British
city
---
where
two
spare
clerks
,
like
dried
dragoons
,
in
green
velvet
caps
adorned
with
golden
tassels
,
stood
,
bearded
,
behind
a
small
counter
in
a
small
room
,
containing
no
other
visible
objects
than
an
empty
iron
-
safe
with
the
door
open
,
a
jug
of
water
,
and
a
papering
of
garland
of
roses
;
but
who
,
on
lawful
requisition
,
by
merely
dipping
their
hands
out
of
sight
,
could
produce
exhaustless
mounds
of
five
-
franc
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
Below
the
Bank
was
a
suite
of
three
or
four
rooms
with
barred
windows
,
which
had
the
appearance
of
a
jail
for
criminal
rats
.
 
<EOS>
Above
the
Bank
was
Mrs
Gowan
's
residence
.
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
that
its
walls
were
blotched
,
as
if
missionary
maps
were
bursting
out
of
them
to
impart
geographical
knowledge
;
notwithstanding
that
its
weird
furniture
was
forlornly
faded
and
musty
,
and
that
the
prevailing
Venetian
odour
of
bilge
water
and
an
ebb
tide
on
a
weedy
shore
was
very
strong
;
the
place
was
better
within
,
than
it
promised
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
by
a
smiling
man
like
a
reformed
assassin
---
a
temporary
servant
---
who
ushered
them
into
the
room
where
Mrs
Gowan
sat
,
with
the
announcement
that
two
beautiful
English
ladies
were
come
to
see
the
mistress
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
,
who
was
engaged
in
needlework
,
put
her
work
aside
in
a
covered
basket
,
and
rose
,
a
little
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
was
excessively
courteous
to
her
,
and
said
the
usual
nothings
with
the
skill
of
a
veteran
.
   
<EOS>
"
Papa
was
extremely
sorry
,
"
proceeded
Fanny
,
"
to
be
engaged
to
-
day
(
he
is
so
much
engaged
here
,
our
acquaintance
being
so
wretchedly
large
!
)
;
and
particularly
requested
me
to
bring
his
card
for
Mr
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
may
be
sure
to
acquit
myself
of
a
commission
which
he
impressed
upon
me
at
least
a
dozen
times
,
allow
me
to
relieve
my
conscience
by
placing
it
on
the
table
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Which
she
did
with
veteran
ease
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
charmed
to
understand
that
you
know
the
Merdles
.
 
<EOS>
We
hope
it
may
be
another
means
of
bringing
us
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
friends
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
"
of
Mr
Gowan
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
a
personal
introduction
to
Mrs
Merdle
,
but
I
suppose
I
shall
be
presented
to
her
at
Rome
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
"
returned
Fanny
,
with
an
appearance
of
amiably
quenching
her
own
superiority
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
'll
like
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
her
very
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
"
said
Fanny
,
with
a
frank
action
of
her
pretty
shoulders
,
"
in
London
one
knows
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
We
met
her
on
our
way
here
,
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
papa
was
at
first
rather
cross
with
her
for
taking
one
of
the
rooms
that
our
people
had
ordered
for
us
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
of
course
,
that
soon
blew
over
,
and
we
were
all
good
friends
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Although
the
visit
had
as
yet
given
Little
Dorrit
no
opportunity
of
conversing
with
Mrs
Gowan
,
there
was
a
silent
understanding
between
them
,
which
did
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
at
Mrs
Gowan
with
keen
and
unabated
interest
;
the
sound
of
her
voice
was
thrilling
to
her
;
nothing
that
was
near
her
,
or
about
her
,
or
at
all
concerned
her
,
escaped
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
quicker
to
perceive
the
slightest
matter
here
,
than
in
any
other
case
---
but
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
quite
well
,
"
she
now
said
,
"
since
that
night
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
always
well
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
timidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
yes
,
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
reason
for
her
faltering
and
breaking
off
,
other
than
that
Mrs
Gowan
had
touched
her
hand
in
speaking
to
her
,
and
their
looks
had
met
.
 
<EOS>
Something
thoughtfully
apprehensive
in
the
large
,
soft
eyes
,
had
checked
Little
Dorrit
in
an
instant
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
that
you
are
a
favourite
of
my
husband
's
,
and
that
I
am
almost
bound
to
be
jealous
of
you
?
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
blushing
,
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
will
tell
you
,
if
he
tells
you
what
he
tells
me
,
that
you
are
quieter
and
quicker
of
resource
than
any
one
he
ever
saw
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
speaks
far
too
well
of
me
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
that
;
but
I
do
n't
at
all
doubt
that
I
must
tell
him
you
are
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
be
forgiven
,
if
I
were
to
let
you
---
and
Miss
Dorrit
---
go
,
without
doing
so
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
excuse
the
disorder
and
discomfort
of
a
painter
's
studio
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
inquiries
were
addressed
to
Miss
Fanny
,
who
graciously
replied
that
she
would
be
beyond
anything
interested
and
enchanted
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
went
to
a
door
,
looked
in
beyond
it
,
and
came
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
Henry
the
favour
to
come
in
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
I
knew
he
would
be
pleased
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
first
object
that
confronted
Little
Dorrit
,
entering
first
,
was
Blandois
of
Paris
in
a
great
cloak
and
a
furtive
slouched
hat
,
standing
on
a
throne
platform
in
a
corner
,
as
he
had
stood
on
the
Great
Saint
Bernard
,
when
the
warning
arms
seemed
to
be
all
pointing
up
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
recoiled
from
this
figure
,
as
it
smiled
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
"
said
Gowan
,
coming
from
his
easel
behind
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
Blandois
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
doing
duty
as
a
model
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
am
making
a
study
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
saves
me
money
to
turn
him
to
some
use
.
 
<EOS>
We
poor
painters
have
none
to
spare
.
"
   
<EOS>
Blandois
of
Paris
pulled
off
his
slouched
hat
,
and
saluted
the
ladies
without
coming
out
of
his
corner
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
pardons
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
Professore
here
is
so
inexorable
with
me
,
that
I
am
afraid
to
stir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
stir
,
then
,
"
said
Gowan
coolly
,
as
the
sisters
approached
the
easel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
the
ladies
at
least
see
the
original
of
the
daub
,
that
they
may
know
what
it
's
meant
for
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
stands
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
A
bravo
waiting
for
his
prey
,
a
distinguished
noble
waiting
to
save
his
country
,
the
common
enemy
waiting
to
do
somebody
a
bad
turn
,
an
angelic
messenger
waiting
to
do
somebody
a
good
turn
---
<EOS>
whatever
you
think
he
looks
most
like
!
"
<EOS>
"
Say
,
Professore
Mio
,
a
poor
gentleman
waiting
to
do
homage
to
elegance
and
beauty
,
"
remarked
Blandois
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
say
,
Cattivo
Soggetto
Mio
,
"
returned
Gowan
,
touching
the
painted
face
with
his
brush
in
the
part
where
the
real
face
had
moved
,
"
a
murderer
after
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Show
that
white
hand
of
yours
,
Blandois
.
 
<EOS>
Put
it
outside
the
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
it
still
.
"
   
<EOS>
Blandois
'
hand
was
unsteady
;
but
he
laughed
,
and
that
would
naturally
shake
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
formerly
in
some
scuffle
with
another
murderer
,
or
with
a
victim
,
you
observe
,
"
said
Gowan
,
putting
in
the
markings
of
the
hand
with
a
quick
,
impatient
,
unskilful
touch
,
"
and
these
are
the
tokens
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Outside
the
cloak
,
man
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Corpo
di
San
Marco
,
what
are
you
thinking
of
?
"
   
<EOS>
Blandois
of
Paris
shook
with
a
laugh
again
,
so
that
his
hand
shook
more
;
now
he
raised
it
to
twist
his
moustache
,
which
had
a
damp
appearance
;
and
now
he
stood
in
the
required
position
,
with
a
little
new
swagger
.
   
<EOS>
His
face
was
so
directed
in
reference
to
the
spot
where
Little
Dorrit
stood
by
the
easel
,
that
throughout
he
looked
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
Once
attracted
by
his
peculiar
eyes
,
she
could
not
remove
her
own
,
and
they
had
looked
at
each
other
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
trembled
now
;
Gowan
,
feeling
it
,
and
supposing
her
to
be
alarmed
by
the
large
dog
beside
him
,
whose
head
she
caressed
in
her
hand
,
and
who
had
just
uttered
a
low
growl
,
glanced
at
her
to
say
,
"
He
wo
n't
hurt
you
,
Miss
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afraid
of
him
,
"
she
returned
in
the
same
breath
;
"
but
will
you
look
at
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
In
a
moment
Gowan
had
thrown
down
his
brush
,
and
seized
the
dog
with
both
hands
by
the
collar
.
   
<EOS>
"
Blandois
!
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
be
such
a
fool
as
to
provoke
him
!
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
and
the
other
place
too
,
he
'll
tear
you
to
bits
!
 
<EOS>
Lie
down
!
   
<EOS>
Lion
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
my
voice
,
you
rebel
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
great
dog
,
regardless
of
being
half
-
choked
by
his
collar
,
was
obdurately
pulling
with
his
dead
weight
against
his
master
,
resolved
to
get
across
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
crouching
for
a
spring
at
the
moment
when
his
master
caught
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lion
!
 
<EOS>
Lion
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
up
on
his
hind
legs
,
and
it
was
a
wrestle
between
master
and
dog
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
back
!
 
<EOS>
Down
,
Lion
!
 
<EOS>
Get
out
of
his
sight
,
Blandois
!
 
<EOS>
What
devil
have
you
conjured
into
the
dog
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
nothing
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Get
out
of
his
sight
or
I
ca
n't
hold
the
wild
beast
!
 
<EOS>
Get
out
of
the
room
!
 
<EOS>
By
my
soul
,
he
'll
kill
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
dog
,
with
a
ferocious
bark
,
made
one
other
struggle
as
Blandois
vanished
;
then
,
in
the
moment
of
the
dog
's
submission
,
the
master
,
little
less
angry
than
the
dog
,
felled
him
with
a
blow
on
the
head
,
and
standing
over
him
,
struck
him
many
times
severely
with
the
heel
of
his
boot
,
so
that
his
mouth
was
presently
bloody
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
get
you
into
that
corner
and
lie
down
,
"
said
Gowan
,
"
or
I
'll
take
you
out
and
shoot
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Lion
did
as
he
was
ordered
,
and
lay
down
licking
his
mouth
and
chest
.
 
<EOS>
Lion
's
master
stopped
for
a
moment
to
take
breath
,
and
then
,
recovering
his
usual
coolness
of
manner
,
turned
to
speak
to
his
frightened
wife
and
her
visitors
.
 
<EOS>
Probably
the
whole
occurrence
had
not
occupied
two
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Minnie
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
he
is
always
good
-
humoured
and
tractable
.
 
<EOS>
Blandois
must
have
irritated
him
,
---
made
faces
at
him
.
<EOS>
The
dog
has
his
likings
and
dislikings
,
and
Blandois
is
no
great
favourite
of
his
;
but
I
am
sure
you
will
give
him
a
character
,
Minnie
,
for
never
having
been
like
this
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
Minnie
was
too
much
disturbed
to
say
anything
connected
in
reply
;
Little
Dorrit
was
already
occupied
in
soothing
her
;
Fanny
,
who
had
cried
out
twice
or
thrice
,
held
Gowan
's
arm
for
protection
;
Lion
,
deeply
ashamed
of
having
caused
them
this
alarm
,
came
trailing
himself
along
the
ground
to
the
feet
of
his
mistress
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
furious
brute
,
"
said
Gowan
,
striking
him
with
his
foot
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
do
penance
for
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
struck
him
again
,
and
yet
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
pray
do
n't
punish
him
any
more
,
"
cried
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
hurt
him
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
gentle
he
is
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
her
entreaty
,
Gowan
spared
him
;
and
he
deserved
her
intercession
,
for
truly
he
was
as
submissive
,
and
as
sorry
,
and
as
wretched
as
a
dog
could
be
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
easy
to
recover
this
shock
and
make
the
visit
unrestrained
,
even
though
Fanny
had
not
been
,
under
the
best
of
circumstances
,
the
least
trifle
in
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
In
such
further
communication
as
passed
among
them
before
the
sisters
took
their
departure
,
Little
Dorrit
fancied
it
was
revealed
to
her
that
Mr
Gowan
treated
his
wife
,
even
in
his
very
fondness
,
too
much
like
a
beautiful
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
so
unsuspicious
of
the
depths
of
feeling
which
she
knew
must
lie
below
that
surface
,
that
she
doubted
if
there
could
be
any
such
depths
in
himself
.
 
<EOS>
She
wondered
whether
his
want
of
earnestness
might
be
the
natural
result
of
his
want
of
such
qualities
,
and
whether
it
was
with
people
as
with
ships
,
that
,
in
too
shallow
and
rocky
waters
,
their
anchors
had
no
hold
,
and
they
drifted
anywhere
.
   
<EOS>
He
attended
them
down
the
staircase
,
jocosely
apologising
for
the
poor
quarters
to
which
such
poor
fellows
as
himself
were
limited
,
and
remarking
that
when
the
high
and
mighty
Barnacles
,
his
relatives
,
who
would
be
dreadfully
ashamed
of
them
,
presented
him
with
better
,
he
would
live
in
better
to
oblige
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
water
's
edge
they
were
saluted
by
Blandois
,
who
looked
white
enough
after
his
late
adventure
,
but
who
made
very
light
of
it
notwithstanding
,
---
laughing
at
the
mention
of
Lion
.
   
<EOS>
Leaving
the
two
together
under
the
scrap
of
vine
upon
the
causeway
,
Gowan
idly
scattering
the
leaves
from
it
into
the
water
,
and
Blandois
lighting
a
cigarette
,
the
sisters
were
paddled
away
in
state
as
they
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
not
glided
on
for
many
minutes
,
when
Little
Dorrit
became
aware
that
Fanny
was
more
showy
in
manner
than
the
occasion
appeared
to
require
,
and
,
looking
about
for
the
cause
through
the
window
and
through
the
open
door
,
saw
another
gondola
evidently
in
waiting
on
them
.
   
<EOS>
As
this
gondola
attended
their
progress
in
various
artful
ways
;
sometimes
shooting
on
a
-
head
,
and
stopping
to
let
them
pass
;
sometimes
,
when
the
way
was
broad
enough
,
skimming
along
side
by
side
with
them
;
and
sometimes
following
close
astern
;
and
as
Fanny
gradually
made
no
disguise
that
she
was
playing
off
graces
upon
somebody
within
it
,
of
whom
she
at
the
same
time
feigned
to
be
unconscious
;
Little
Dorrit
at
length
asked
who
it
was
?
   
<EOS>
To
which
Fanny
made
the
short
answer
,
"
That
gaby
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
"
returned
Fanny
(
in
a
tone
suggesting
that
before
her
Uncle
's
protest
she
might
have
said
,
You
little
fool
,
instead
)
,
"
how
slow
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
Young
Sparkler
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
lowered
the
window
on
her
side
,
and
,
leaning
back
and
resting
her
elbow
on
it
negligently
,
fanned
herself
with
a
rich
Spanish
fan
of
black
and
gold
.
 
<EOS>
The
attendant
gondola
,
having
skimmed
forward
again
,
with
some
swift
trace
of
an
eye
in
the
   
window
,
Fanny
laughed
coquettishly
and
said
,
"
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
fool
,
my
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
means
to
follow
you
all
the
way
?
"
asked
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
precious
child
,
"
returned
Fanny
,
"
I
ca
n't
possibly
answer
for
what
an
idiot
in
a
state
of
desperation
may
do
,
but
I
should
think
it
highly
probable
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
such
an
enormous
distance
.
 
<EOS>
All
Venice
would
scarcely
be
that
,
I
imagine
,
if
he
's
dying
for
a
glimpse
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
is
he
?
"
asked
Little
Dorrit
in
perfect
simplicity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
love
,
that
really
is
an
awkward
question
for
me
to
answer
,
"
said
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
ask
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
He
tells
Edward
he
is
,
<EOS>
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
he
makes
a
perfect
spectacle
of
himself
at
the
Casino
,
and
that
sort
of
places
,
by
going
on
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
had
better
ask
Edward
if
you
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
he
does
n't
call
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
after
thinking
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Amy
,
your
wonder
will
soon
cease
,
if
I
am
rightly
informed
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
he
called
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
The
creature
has
only
been
waiting
to
get
his
courage
up
,
I
suspect
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
see
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
my
darling
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
that
's
just
as
it
may
happen
.
<EOS>
Here
he
is
again
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
you
simpleton
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
had
,
undeniably
,
a
weak
appearance
;
with
his
eye
in
the
window
like
a
knot
in
the
glass
,
and
no
reason
on
earth
for
stopping
his
bark
suddenly
,
except
the
real
reason
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
asked
me
if
I
will
see
him
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Fanny
,
almost
as
well
composed
in
the
graceful
indifference
of
her
attitude
as
Mrs
Merdle
herself
,
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
---
"
I
think
I
rather
mean
what
do
you
mean
,
dear
Fanny
?
"
   
<EOS>
Fanny
laughed
again
,
in
a
manner
at
once
condescending
,
arch
,
and
affable
;
and
said
,
putting
her
arm
round
her
sister
in
a
playfully
affectionate
way
:
   
"
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
,
my
little
pet
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
saw
that
woman
at
Martigny
,
how
did
you
think
she
carried
it
off
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
see
what
she
decided
on
in
a
moment
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Fanny
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
tell
you
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
She
settled
with
herself
,
now
I
'll
never
refer
to
that
meeting
under
such
different
circumstances
,
and
I
'll
never
pretend
to
have
any
idea
that
these
are
the
same
girls
.
<EOS>
That
's
her
way
out
of
a
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
I
tell
you
when
we
came
away
from
Harley
Street
that
time
?
 
<EOS>
She
is
as
insolent
and
false
as
any
woman
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
first
capacity
,
my
love
,
she
may
find
people
who
can
match
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
significant
turn
of
the
Spanish
fan
towards
Fanny
's
bosom
,
indicated
with
great
expression
where
one
of
these
people
was
to
be
found
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
only
that
,
"
pursued
Fanny
,
"
but
she
gives
the
same
charge
to
Young
Sparkler
;
and
does
n't
let
him
come
after
me
until
she
has
got
it
thoroughly
into
his
most
ridiculous
of
all
ridiculous
noddles
(
for
one
really
ca
n't
call
it
a
head
)
,
that
he
is
to
pretend
to
have
been
first
struck
with
me
in
that
Inn
Yard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
asked
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
 
<EOS>
Good
gracious
,
my
love
!
"
<EOS>
(
again
very
much
in
the
tone
of
You
<EOS>
stupid
little
creature
)
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
ask
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
that
I
may
have
become
a
rather
desirable
match
for
a
noddle
?
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
see
that
she
puts
the
deception
upon
us
,
and
makes
a
pretence
,
while
she
shifts
it
from
her
own
shoulders
(
very
good
shoulders
they
are
too
<EOS>
,
I
must
say
)
,
"
observed
Miss
Fanny
,
glancing
complacently
at
herself
,
"
of
considering
our
feelings
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
we
can
always
go
back
to
the
plain
truth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
if
you
please
we
wo
n't
,
"
retorted
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
am
not
going
to
have
that
done
,
<EOS>
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
The
pretext
is
none
of
mine
;
it
's
hers
,
and
she
shall
have
enough
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
triumphant
exaltation
of
her
feelings
,
Miss
Fanny
,
using
her
Spanish
fan
with
one
hand
,
squeezed
her
sister
's
waist
with
the
other
,
as
if
she
were
crushing
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
repeated
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
shall
find
me
go
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
it
,
and
I
'll
follow
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
with
the
blessing
of
fate
and
fortune
,
I
'll
go
on
improving
that
woman
's
acquaintance
until
I
have
given
her
maid
,
before
her
eyes
,
things
from
my
dressmaker
's
ten
times
as
handsome
and
expensive
as
she
once
gave
me
from
hers
!
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
silent
;
sensible
that
she
was
not
to
be
heard
on
any
question
affecting
the
family
dignity
,
and
unwilling
to
lose
to
no
purpose
her
sister
's
newly
and
unexpectedly
restored
favour
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
concur
,
but
she
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
well
knew
what
she
was
thinking
of
;
so
well
,
that
she
soon
asked
her
.
   
<EOS>
Her
reply
was
,
"
Do
you
mean
to
encourage
Mr
Sparkler
,
Fanny
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Encourage
him
,
my
dear
?
"
said
her
sister
,
smiling
contemptuously
,
"
that
depends
upon
what
you
call
encourage
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
encourage
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
make
a
slave
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
glanced
seriously
and
doubtfully
in
her
face
,
but
Fanny
was
not
to
be
so
brought
to
a
check
.
 
<EOS>
She
furled
her
fan
of
black
and
gold
,
and
used
it
to
tap
her
sister
's
nose
;
with
the
air
of
a
proud
beauty
and
a
great
spirit
,
who
toyed
with
and
playfully
instructed
a
homely
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
him
fetch
and
carry
,
my
dear
,
and
I
shall
make
him
subject
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
do
n't
make
his
mother
subject
to
me
,
too
,
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
---
<EOS>
dear
Fanny
,
do
n't
be
offended
,
we
are
so
comfortable
together
now
---
that
you
can
quite
see
the
end
of
that
course
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
have
so
much
as
looked
for
it
yet
,
my
dear
,
"
answered
Fanny
,
with
supreme
indifference
;
"
all
in
good
time
.
 
<EOS>
Such
are
my
intentions
.
 
<EOS>
And
really
they
have
taken
me
so
long
to
develop
,
that
here
we
are
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
Young
Sparkler
at
the
door
,
inquiring
who
is
within
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
merest
accident
,
of
course
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
effect
,
the
swain
was
standing
up
in
his
gondola
,
card
-
case
in
hand
,
affecting
to
put
the
question
to
a
servant
.
 
<EOS>
This
conjunction
of
circumstances
led
to
his
immediately
afterwards
presenting
himself
before
the
young
ladies
in
a
posture
,
which
in
ancient
times
would
not
have
been
considered
one
of
favourable
augury
for
his
suit
;
since
the
gondoliers
of
the
young
ladies
,
having
been
put
to
some
inconvenience
by
the
chase
,
so
neatly
brought
their
own
boat
in
the
gentlest
collision
with
the
bark
of
Mr
Sparkler
,
as
to
tip
that
gentleman
over
like
a
larger
species
of
ninepin
,
and
cause
him
to
exhibit
the
soles
of
his
shoes
to
the
object
of
his
dearest
wishes
:
while
the
nobler
portions
of
his
anatomy
struggled
at
the
bottom
of
his
boat
in
the
arms
of
one
of
his
men
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
as
Miss
Fanny
called
out
with
much
concern
,
Was
the
gentleman
hurt
,
Mr
Sparkler
rose
more
restored
than
might
have
been
expected
,
and
stammered
for
himself
with
blushes
,
"
Not
at
all
so
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
had
no
recollection
of
having
ever
seen
him
before
,
and
was
passing
on
,
with
a
distant
inclination
of
her
head
,
when
he
announced
himself
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
Even
then
she
was
in
a
difficulty
from
being
unable
to
call
it
to
mind
,
until
he
explained
that
he
had
had
the
honour
of
seeing
her
at
Martigny
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
remembered
him
,
and
hoped
his
lady
-
mother
was
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
stammered
Mr
Sparkler
,
"
<EOS>
she
's
uncommonly
well
---
at
least
,
poorly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
Venice
?
"
said
Miss
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
Rome
,
"
Mr
Sparkler
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
by
myself
,
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
to
call
upon
Mr
Edward
Dorrit
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
upon
Mr
Dorrit
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
upon
the
family
.
"
   
Turning
graciously
to
the
attendants
,
Miss
Fanny
inquired
whether
her
papa
or
brother
was
within
?
 
<EOS>
The
reply
being
that
they
were
both
within
,
Mr
Sparkler
humbly
offered
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
accepting
it
,
was
squired
up
the
great
staircase
by
Mr
Sparkler
,
who
,
if
he
still
believed
(
which
there
is
not
any
reason
to
doubt
)
that
she
had
no
nonsense
about
her
,
rather
deceived
himself
.
   
<EOS>
Arrived
in
a
mouldering
reception
-
room
,
where
the
faded
hangings
,
of
a
sad
sea
-
green
,
had
worn
and
withered
until
they
looked
as
if
they
might
have
claimed
kindred
with
the
waifs
of
seaweed
drifting
under
the
windows
,
or
clinging
to
the
walls
and
weeping
for
their
imprisoned
relations
,
Miss
Fanny
despatched
emissaries
for
her
father
and
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Pending
whose
appearance
,
she
showed
to
great
advantage
on
a
sofa
,
completing
Mr
Sparkler
's
conquest
with
some
remarks
upon
Dante
---
known
to
that
gentleman
as
an
eccentric
man
in
the
nature
of
an
Old
File
,
who
used
to
put
leaves
round
his
head
,
and
sit
upon
a
stool
for
some
unaccountable
purpose
,
outside
the
cathedral
at
Florence
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
welcomed
the
visitor
with
the
highest
urbanity
,
and
most
courtly
manners
.
 
<EOS>
He
inquired
particularly
after
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
He
inquired
particularly
after
Mr
Merdle

<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
said
,
or
rather
twitched
out
of
himself
in
small
pieces
by
the
shirt
-
collar
,
that
Mrs
Merdle
having
completely
used
up
her
place
in
the
country
,
and
also
her
house
at
Brighton
,
and
being
,
of
course
,
unable
,
do
n't
you
see
,
to
remain
in
London
when
there
was
n't
a
soul
there
,
and
not
feeling
herself
this
year
quite
up
to
visiting
about
at
people
's
places
,
had
resolved
to
have
a
touch
at
Rome
,
where
a
woman
like
herself
,
with
a
proverbially
fine
appearance
,
and
with
no
nonsense
about
her
,
could
n't
fail
to
be
a
great
acquisition
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Merdle
,
he
was
so
much
wanted
by
the
men
in
the
City
and
the
rest
of
those
places
,
and
was
such
a
doosed
extraordinary
phenomenon
in
Buying
and
Banking
and
that
,
that
Mr
Sparkler
doubted
if
the
monetary
system
of
the
country
would
be
able
to
spare
him
;
though
that
his
work
was
occasionally
one
too
many
for
him
,
and
that
he
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
temporary
shy
at
an
entirely
new
scene
and
climate
,
Mr
Sparkler
did
not
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
himself
,
Mr
Sparkler
conveyed
to
the
Dorrit
family
that
he
was
going
,
on
rather
particular
business
,
wherever
they
were
going
.
   
<EOS>
This
immense
conversational
achievement
required
time
,
but
was
effected
.
 
<EOS>
Being
effected
,
Mr
Dorrit
expressed
his
hope
that
Mr
Sparkler
would
shortly
dine
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
received
the
idea
so
kindly
that
Mr
Dorrit
asked
what
he
was
going
to
do
that
day
,
for
instance
?
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
going
to
do
nothing
that
day
(
his
usual
occupation
,
and
one
for
which
he
was
particularly
qualified
)
,
he
was
secured
without
postponement
;
being
further
bound
over
to
accompany
the
ladies
to
the
Opera
in
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
At
dinner
-
time
Mr
Sparkler
rose
out
of
the
sea
,
like
Venus
's
son
taking
after
his
mother
,
and
made
a
splendid
appearance
ascending
the
great
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
If
Fanny
had
been
charming
in
the
morning
,
she
was
now
thrice
charming
,
very
becomingly
dressed
in
her
most
suitable
colours
,
and
with
an
air
of
negligence
upon
her
that
doubled
Mr
Sparkler
's
fetters
,
and
riveted
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
are
acquainted
,
Mr
Sparkler
,
"
said
his
host
at
dinner
,
"
with
---
ha
---
Mr
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Henry
Gowan
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
mother
and
my
mother
are
cronies
in
fact
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
thought
of
it
,
Amy
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
with
a
patronage
as
magnificent
as
that
of
Lord
Decimus
himself
,
"
you
should
have
despatched
a
note
to
them
,
asking
them
to
dine
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
our
people
could
have
---
ha
---
fetched
them
,
and
taken
them
home
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
have
spared
a
---
hum
---
gondola
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
have
forgotten
this
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
remind
me
of
them
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
not
without
doubts
how
Mr
Henry
Gowan
might
take
their
patronage
;
but
she
promised
not
to
fail
in
the
reminder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
does
Mr
Henry
Gowan
paint
---
ha
---
Portraits
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
opined
that
he
painted
anything
,
if
he
could
get
the
job
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
no
particular
walk
?
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
,
stimulated
by
Love
to
brilliancy
,
replied
that
for
a
particular
walk
a
man
ought
to
have
a
particular
pair
of
shoes
;
as
,
for
example
,
shooting
,
shooting
-
shoes
;
cricket
,
cricket
-
shoes
.
<EOS>
Whereas
,
he
believed
that
Henry
Gowan
had
no
particular
pair
of
shoes
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
speciality
?
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
This
being
a
very
long
word
for
Mr
Sparkler
,
and
his
mind
being
exhausted
by
his
late
effort
,
he
replied
,
"
No
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
seldom
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
agreeable
to
me
to
present
a
gentleman
so
connected
,
with
some
---
ha
---
Testimonial
of
my
desire
to
further
his
interests
,
and
develop
the
---
hum
---
germs
of
his
genius
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
engage
Mr
Gowan
to
paint
my
picture
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
result
should
be
---
ha
---
mutually
satisfactory
,
I
might
afterwards
engage
him
to
try
his
hand
upon
my
family
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
exquisitely
bold
and
original
thought
presented
itself
to
Mr
Sparkler
,
that
there
was
an
opening
here
for
saying
there
were
some
of
the
family
(
emphasising
"
some
"
in
a
marked
manner
)
to
whom
no
painter
could
render
justice
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
want
of
a
form
of
words
in
which
to
express
the
idea
,
it
returned
to
the
skies
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
more
to
be
regretted
as
Miss
Fanny
greatly
applauded
the
notion
of
the
portrait
,
and
urged
her
papa
to
act
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
surmised
,
she
said
,
that
Mr
Gowan
had
lost
better
and
higher
opportunities
by
marrying
his
pretty
wife
;
and
Love
in
a
cottage
,
painting
pictures
for
dinner
<EOS>
,
was
so
delightfully
interesting
,
that
she
begged
her
papa
to
give
him
the
commission
whether
he
could
paint
a
likeness
or
not
:
though
indeed
both
she
and
Amy
knew
he
could
,
from
having
seen
a
speaking
likeness
on
his
easel
that
day
,
and
having
had
the
opportunity
of
comparing
it
with
the
original
.
<EOS>
These
remarks
made
Mr
Sparkler
(
as
perhaps
they
were
intended
to
do
)
nearly
distracted
;
for
while
on
the
one
hand
they
expressed
Miss
Fanny
's
susceptibility
of
the
tender
passion
,
she
herself
showed
such
an
innocent
unconsciousness
of
his
admiration
that
his
eyes
goggled
in
his
head
with
jealousy
of
an
unknown
rival
.
   
<EOS>
Descending
into
the
sea
again
after
dinner
,
and
ascending
out
of
it
at
the
Opera
staircase
,
preceded
by
one
of
their
gondoliers
,
like
an
attendant
Merman
,
with
a
great
linen
lantern
,
they
entered
their
box
,
and
Mr
Sparkler
entered
on
an
evening
of
agony
.
 
<EOS>
The
theatre
being
dark
,
and
the
box
light
,
several
visitors
lounged
in
during
the
representation
;
in
whom
Fanny
was
so
interested
,
and
in
conversation
with
whom
she
fell
into
such
charming
attitudes
,
as
she
had
little
confidences
with
them
,
and
little
disputes
concerning
the
identity
of
people
in
distant
boxes
,
that
the
wretched
Sparkler
hated
all
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
two
consolations
at
the
close
of
the
performance
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
fan
to
hold
while
she
adjusted
her
cloak
,
and
it
was
his
blessed
privilege
to
give
her
his
arm
down
-
stairs
again
.
 
<EOS>
These
crumbs
of
encouragement
<EOS>
,
Mr
Sparkler
thought
,
would
just
keep
him
going
;
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
Miss
Dorrit
thought
so
too
.
   
<EOS>
The
Merman
with
his
light
was
ready
at
the
box
-
door
,
and
other
Mermen
with
other
lights
were
ready
at
many
of
the
doors
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dorrit
Merman
held
his
lantern
low
,
to
show
the
steps
,
and
Mr
Sparkler
put
on
another
heavy
set
of
fetters
over
his
former
set
,
as
he
watched
her
radiant
feet
twinkling
down
the
stairs
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
loiterers
here
,
was
Blandois
of
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
,
and
moved
forward
beside
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
in
front
with
her
brother
and
Mrs
General
<EOS>
(
Mr
Dorrit
had
remained
at
home
)
,
but
on
the
brink
of
the
quay
they
all
came
together
.
 
<EOS>
She
started
again
to
find
Blandois
close
to
her
,
handing
Fanny
into
the
boat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gowan
has
had
a
loss
,
"
he
said
,
"
since
he
was
made
happy
to
-
day
by
a
visit
from
fair
ladies
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
loss
?
"
repeated
Fanny
,
relinquished
by
the
bereaved
Sparkler
,
and
taking
her
seat
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
loss
,
"
said
Blandois
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
dog
Lion
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
's
hand
was
in
his
,
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
dead
,
"
said
Blandois
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
?
"
echoed
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
noble
dog
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Faith
,
dear
ladies
!
"
said
Blandois
,
smiling
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
"
somebody
has
poisoned
that
noble
dog

<EOS>
He
is
as
dead
as
the
Doges
!

Mostly

Mrs
General
,
always
on
her
coach
-
box
keeping
the
proprieties
well
together
,
took
pains
to
form
a
surface
on
her
very
dear
young
friend
,
and
Mrs
General
's
very
dear
young
friend
tried
hard
to
receive
it
.
 
<EOS>
Hard
as
she
had
tried
in
her
laborious
life
to
attain
many
ends
,
she
had
never
tried
harder
than
she
did
now
,
to
be
varnished
by
Mrs
General
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
her
anxious
and
ill
at
ease
to
be
operated
upon
by
that
smoothing
hand
,
it
is
true
;
but
she
submitted
herself
to
the
family
want
in
its
greatness
as
she
had
submitted
herself
to
the
family
want
in
its
littleness
,
and
yielded
to
her
own
inclinations
in
this
thing
no
more
than
she
had
yielded
to
her
hunger
itself
,
in
the
days
when
she
had
saved
her
dinner
that
her
father
might
have
his
supper
.
   
<EOS>
One
comfort
that
she
had
under
the
Ordeal
by
General
was
more
sustaining
to
her
,
and
made
her
more
grateful
than
to
a
less
devoted
and
affectionate
spirit
,
not
habituated
to
her
struggles
and
sacrifices
,
might
appear
quite
reasonable
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
may
often
be
observed
in
life
,
<EOS>
that
spirits
like
Little
Dorrit
do
not
appear
to
reason
half
as
carefully
as
the
folks
who
get
the
better
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
continued
kindness
of
her
sister
was
this
comfort
to
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
to
her
that
the
kindness
took
the
form
of
tolerant
patronage
;
she
was
used
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
to
her
that
it
kept
her
in
a
tributary
position
,
and
showed
her
in
attendance
on
the
flaming
car
in
which
Miss
Fanny
sat
on
an
elevated
seat
,
exacting
homage
;
she
sought
no
better
place
.
 
<EOS>
Always
admiring
Fanny
's
beauty
,
and
grace
,
and
readiness
,
and
not
now
asking
herself
how
much
of
her
disposition
to
be
strongly
attached
to
Fanny
was
due
to
her
own
heart
,
and
how
much
to
Fanny
's
,
she
gave
her
all
the
sisterly
fondness
her
great
heart
contained
.
   
<EOS>
The
wholesale
amount
of
Prunes
and
Prism
which
Mrs
General
infused
into
the
family
life
,
combined
with
the
perpetual
plunges
made
by
Fanny
into
society
,
left
but
a
very
small
residue
of
any
natural
deposit
at
the
bottom
of
the
mixture
.
 
<EOS>
This
rendered
confidences
with
Fanny
doubly
precious
to
Little
Dorrit
,
and
heightened
the
relief
they
afforded
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
"
said
Fanny
to
her
one
night
when
they
were
alone
,
after
a
day
so
tiring
that
Little
Dorrit
was
quite
worn
out
,
though
Fanny
would
have
taken
another
dip
into
society
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
life
,
"
I
am
going
to
put
something
into
your
little
head
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
guess
what
it
is
,
I
suspect
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
's
likely
,
dear
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
I
'll
give
you
a

said
Fanny
.

"
Mrs

<EOS>
Prunes
and
Prism
,
in
a
thousand
combinations
,
having
been
wearily
in
the
ascendant
all
day
---
everything
having
been
surface
and
varnish
and
show
without
substance
---
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
looked
as
if
she
had
hoped
that
Mrs
General
was
safely
tucked
up
in
bed
for
some
hours
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
can
you
guess
,
Amy
?
"
said
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Unless
I
have
done
anything
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
rather
alarmed
,
and
meaning
anything
calculated
to
crack
varnish
and
ruffle
surface
.
   
<EOS>
Fanny
was
so
very
much
amused
by
the
misgiving
,
that
she
took
up
her
favourite
fan
<EOS>
(
being
then
seated
at
her
dressing
-
table
with
her
armoury
of
cruel
instruments
about
her
,
most
of
them
reeking
from
the
heart
of
Sparkler
)
,
and
tapped
her
sister
frequently
on
the
nose
with
it
,
laughing
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
our
Amy
,
our
Amy
!
"
said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
timid
little
goose
our
Amy
is
!
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
very
cross
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
it
is
not
with
me
,
Fanny
,
I
do
n't
mind
,
"
returned
her
sister
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
mind
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
and
so
will
you
,
Pet
,
when
I
enlighten
you
.
 
<EOS>
Amy
,
has
it
never
struck
you
that
somebody
is
monstrously
polite
to
Mrs
General

"
   
<EOS>
"
Everybody
is
polite
to
Mrs
General
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
---
"
   
"
Because
she
freezes
them
into
it
?
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
;
quite
different
from
that
.
 
<EOS>
Come

<EOS>
Has
it
never
struck
you
,
Amy
,
that
Pa
is
monstrously
polite

Mrs

"
   
<EOS>
Amy
,
murmuring
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
looked
quite
confounded

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

I
dare
say
not

But

said
Fanny

<EOS>
"
He

And

"
Dear
Fanny

do

<EOS>
"
Do

<EOS>
retorted
Fanny

<EOS>
"
My

I

I

,
such
a
paragon
of
accomplishment
,
and
such
an
acquisition
to
our
family
,
that
he
is
ready
to
get
himself
into
a
state
of
perfect
infatuation
with
her
at
any
moment
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
opens
a
pretty
picture
of
things
,
I
hope
?
 
<EOS>
Think
of
me
with
Mrs
General
for
a
Mama
!
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
did
not
reply
,
"
Think
of
me
with
Mrs
General
for
a
Mama
;
"
but
she
looked
anxious
,
and
seriously
inquired
what
had
led
Fanny
to
these
conclusions
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
my
darling
,
"
said
Fanny
,
tartly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
might
as
well
ask
me
how
I
know
when
a
man
is
struck
with
myself
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
I
do
know
.
 
<EOS>
It
happens
pretty
often
:
<EOS>
but
I
always
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
in
much
the
same
way
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
never
heard
Papa
say
anything
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
anything
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
,
darling
child
,
what
necessity
has
he
had
,
yet
awhile
,
to
say
anything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
never
heard
Mrs
General
say
anything
?
"
<EOS>
"
My
goodness
me
,
Amy
,
"
returned
Fanny
,
"
is
she
the
sort
of
woman
to
say
anything
?
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
perfectly
plain
and
clear
that
she
has
nothing
to
do
at
present
but
to
hold
herself
upright
,
keep
her
aggravating
gloves
on
,
and
go
sweeping
about
?
 
<EOS>
Say
anything
!
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
the
ace
of
trumps
in
her
hand
at
whist
,
she
would
n't
say
anything
,
child
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
come
out
when
she
played
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
you
may
be
mistaken
,
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
may
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
yes
,
I
MAY
be
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
but
I
am
not
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
am
glad
you
can
contemplate
such
an
escape
,
my
dear
,
and
<EOS>
I
am
glad
that
you
can
take
this
for
the
present
with
sufficient
coolness
to
think
of
such
a
chance
.
 
<EOS>
It
makes
me
hope
that
you
may
be
able
to
bear
the
connection
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
able
to
bear
it
,
and
I
should
not
try
.
   
<EOS>
I
'd
marry
young
Sparkler
first
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
you
would
never
marry
him
,
Fanny
,
under
any
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
my
dear
,
"
rejoined
that
young
lady
with
exceeding
indifference
,
"
I
would
n't
positively
answer
even
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
knowing
what
might
happen
.
 
<EOS>
Especially
as
I
should
have
many
opportunities
,
afterwards
,
of
treating
that
woman
,
his
mother
,
in
her
own
style
.
 
<EOS>
Which
I
most
decidedly
should
not
be
slow
to
avail
myself
of
,
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
No
more
passed
between
the
sisters
then
;
but
what
had
passed
gave
the
two
subjects
of
Mrs
General
and
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
great
prominence
in
Little
Dorrit
's
mind
,
and
<EOS>
thenceforth
she
thought
very
much
of
both
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
,
having
long
ago
formed
her
own
surface
to
such
perfection
that
it
hid
whatever
was
below
it
(
if
anything
)
,
no
observation
was
to
be
made
in
that
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
was
undeniably
very
polite
to
her
and
had
a
high
opinion
of
her
;
but
Fanny
,
impetuous
at
most
times
,
might
easily
be
wrong
for
all
that
.
   
<EOS>
Whereas
,
the
Sparkler
question
was
on
the
different
footing
that
any
one
could
see
what
was
going
on
there
,
and
Little
Dorrit
saw
it
and
pondered
on
it
with
many
doubts
and
wonderings
.
   
<EOS>
The
devotion
of
Mr
Sparkler
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
caprice
and
cruelty
of
his
enslaver
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
would
prefer
him
to
such
distinction
of
notice
,
that
he
would
chuckle
aloud
with
joy
;
next
day
,
or
next
hour
,
she
would
overlook
him
so
completely
,
and
drop
him
into
such
an
abyss
of
obscurity
,
that
he
would
groan
under
a
weak
pretence
of
coughing
.
 
<EOS>
The
constancy
of
his
attendance
never
touched
Fanny
:
though
he
was
so
inseparable
from
Edward
,
that
,
when
that
gentleman
wished
for
a
change
of
society
,
he
was
under
the
irksome
necessity
of
gliding
out
like
a
conspirator
in
disguised
boats
and
by
secret
doors
and
back
ways
;
though
he
was
so
solicitous
to
know
how
Mr
Dorrit
was
,
that
he
called
every
other
day
to
inquire
,
as
if
Mr
Dorrit
were
the
prey
of
an
intermittent
fever
;
though
he
was
so
constantly
being
paddled
up
and
down
before
the
principal
windows
,
that
he
might
have
been
supposed
to
have
made
a
wager
for
a
large
stake
to
be
paddled
a
thousand
miles
in
a
thousand
hours
;
though
whenever
the
gondola
of
his
mistress
left
the
gate
,
the
gondola
of
Mr
Sparkler
shot
out
from
some
watery
ambush
and
gave
chase
,
as
if
she
were
a
fair
smuggler
and
he
a
custom
-
house
officer
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
probably
owing
to
this
fortification
of
the
natural
strength
of
his
constitution
with
so
much
exposure
to
the
air
,
and
the
salt
sea
,
that
Mr
Sparkler
did
not
pine
outwardly
;
but
,
whatever
the
cause
,
he
was
so
far
from
having
any
prospect
of
moving
his
mistress
by
a
languishing
state
of
health
,
that
he
grew
bluffer
every
day
,
and
that
peculiarity
in
his
appearance
of
seeming
rather
a
swelled
boy
than
a
young
man
,
became
developed
to
an
extraordinary
degree
of
ruddy
puffiness
.
   
<EOS>
Blandois
calling
to
pay
his
respects
,
Mr
Dorrit
received
him
with
affability
as
the
friend
of
Mr
Gowan
,
and
mentioned
to
him
his
idea
of
commissioning
Mr
Gowan
to
transmit
him
to
posterity
.
 
<EOS>
Blandois
highly
extolling
it
,
it
occurred
to
Mr
Dorrit
that
it
might
be
agreeable
to
Blandois
to
communicate
to
his
friend
the
great
opportunity
reserved
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Blandois
accepted
the
commission
with
his
own
free
elegance
of
manner
,
and
swore
he
would
discharge
it
before
he
was
an
hour
older
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
imparting
the
news
to
Gowan
,
that
Master
gave
Mr
Dorrit
to
the
Devil
with
great
liberality
some
round
dozen
of
times
(
for
he
resented
patronage
almost
as
much
as
he
resented
the
want
of
it
)
,
and
was
inclined
to
quarrel
with
his
friend
for
bringing
him
the
message
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
a
defect
in
my
mental
vision
,
Blandois
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
may
I
die
if
I
see
what
you
have
to
do
with
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Death
of
my
life
,
"
replied
Blandois
,
"
nor
I
neither
,
except
that
I
thought
I
was
serving
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
putting
an
upstart
's
hire
in
his
pocket
?
"
said
Gowan
,
frowning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
your
other
friend
to
get
his
head
painted
for
the
sign
of
some
public
-
house
,
and
to
get
it
done
by
a
sign
-
painter
.
<EOS>
Who
am
I
,
and
who
is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Professore
,
"
returned
the
ambassador
,
"
and
who
is
Blandois
?
"
   
<EOS>
Without
appearing
at
all
interested
in
the
latter
question
,
Gowan
angrily
whistled
Mr
Dorrit
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
next
day
,
he
resumed
the
subject
by
saying
in
his
off
-
hand
manner
and
with
a
slighting
laugh
,
"
Well
,
Blandois
,
when
shall
we
go
to
this
Maecenas
of
yours
?
   
<EOS>
We
journeymen
must
take
jobs
when
we
can
get
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
shall
we
go
and
look
after
this
job
?
"
<EOS>
"
When
you
will
,
"
said
the
injured
Blandois
,
"
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
to
do
with
it
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
what
it
is
to
me
,
"
said
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bread
and
cheese
.
<EOS>
One
must
eat
!
 
<EOS>
So
come
along
,
my
Blandois
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
received
them
in
the
presence
of
his
daughters
and
of
Mr
Sparkler
,
who
happened
,
by
some
surprising
accident
,
to
be
calling
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
Sparkler
?
"
said
Gowan
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
have
to
live
by
your
mother
wit
,
<EOS>
old
boy
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
may
get
on
better
than
I
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
then
mentioned
his
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Gowan
,
laughing
,
after
receiving
it
gracefully
enough
,
"
I
am
new
to
the
trade
,
and
not
expert
at
its
mysteries
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
ought
to
look
at
you
in
various
lights
,
tell
you
you
are
a
capital
subject
,
and
consider
when
I
shall
be
sufficiently
disengaged
to
devote
myself
with
the
necessary
enthusiasm
to
the
fine
picture
I
mean
to
make
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
"
and
he
laughed
again
,
"
I
feel
quite
a
traitor
in
the
camp
of
those
dear
,
gifted
,
good
,
noble
fellows
,
my
brother
artists
,
by
not
doing
the
hocus
-
pocus
better
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
been
brought
up
to
it
,
and
it
's
too
late
to
learn
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
fact
is
,
I
am
a
very
bad
painter
,
but
not
much
worse
than
the
generality
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
going
to
throw
away
a
hundred
guineas
or
<EOS>
so
,
I
am
as
poor
as
a
poor
relation
of
great
people
<EOS>
usually
is
,
and
I
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
if
you
'll
throw
them
away
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
the
best
I
can
for
the
money
;
and
if
the
best
should
be
bad
,
why
even
then
,
you
may
probably
have
a
bad
picture
with
a
small
name
to
it
,
instead
of
a
bad
picture
with
a
large
name
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
tone
,
though
not
what
he
had
expected
,
on
the
whole
suited
Mr
Dorrit
remarkably
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
showed
that
the
gentleman
,
highly
connected
,
and
not
a
mere
workman
,
would
be
under
an
obligation
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
expressed
his
satisfaction
in
placing
himself
in
Mr
Gowan
's
hands
,
and
trusted
that
he
would
have
the
pleasure
,
in
their
characters
of
private
gentlemen
,
of
improving
his
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
"
said
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
forsworn
society
since
I
joined
the
brotherhood
of
the
brush
<EOS>
(
the
most
delightful
fellows
on
the
face
of
the
earth
)
,
and
am
glad
enough
to
smell
the
old
fine
gunpowder
now
and
then
,
though
it
did
blow
me
into
mid
-
air
and
my
present
calling
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
not
think
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
and
here
he
laughed
again
in
the
easiest
way
,
"
that
I
am
lapsing
into
the
freemasonry
of
the
craft
---
<EOS>
for
it
's
not
so
;
upon
my
life
I
ca
n't
help
betraying
it
wherever
I
go
,
though
,
by
Jupiter
,
I
love
and
honour
the
craft
with
all
my
might
---
if
I
propose
a
stipulation
as
to
time
and
place
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
could
erect
no
---
hum
---
suspicion
of
that
kind
on
Mr
Gowan
's
frankness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Again
you
are
very
good
,
"
said
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dorrit
,
I
hear
you
are
going
to
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
Rome
,
having
friends
there
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
begin
to
do
you
the
injustice
I
have
conspired
to
do
you
,
there
---
not
here
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
all
be
hurried
during
the
rest
of
our
stay
here
;
and
though
there
's
not
a
poorer
man
with
whole
elbows
in
Venice
,
than
myself
,
I
have
not
quite
got
all
the
Amateur
out
of
me
yet
---
comprising
the
trade
again
<EOS>
,
you
see
!
<EOS>
---
and
ca
n't
fall
on
to
order
,
in
a
hurry
,
for
the
mere
sake
of
the
sixpences
.
<EOS>
"
These
remarks
were
not
less
favourably
received
by
Mr
Dorrit
than
their
predecessors
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
the
prelude
to
the
first
reception
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Gowan
at
dinner
,
and
they
skilfully
placed
Gowan
on
his
usual
ground
in
the
new
family
.
   
<EOS>
His
wife
,
too
,
they
placed
on
her
usual
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
understood
,
with
particular
distinctness
,
that
Mrs
Gowan
's
good
looks
had
cost
her
husband
very
dear
;
that
there
had
been
a
great
disturbance
about
her
in
the
Barnacle
family
;
and
that
the
Dowager
Mrs
Gowan
,
nearly
heart
-
broken
,
had
resolutely
set
her
face
against
the
marriage
until
overpowered
by
her
maternal
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
likewise
clearly
understood
that
the
attachment
had
occasioned
much
family
grief
and
dissension
.
 
<EOS>
Of
honest
Mr
Meagles
no
mention
was
made
;
except
that
it
was
natural
enough
that
a
person
of
that
sort
should
wish
to
raise
his
daughter
out
of
his
own
obscurity
,
and
that
no
one
could
blame
him
for
trying
his
best
to
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
's
interest
in
the
fair
subject
of
this
easily
accepted
belief
was
too
earnest
and
watchful
to
fail
in
accurate
observation
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
see
that
it
had
its
part
in
throwing
upon
Mrs
Gowan
the
touch
of
a
shadow
under
which
she
lived
,
and
she
even
had
an
instinctive
knowledge
that
there
was
not
the
least
truth
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
had
an
influence
in
placing
obstacles
in
the
way
of
her
association
with
Mrs
Gowan
by
making
the
Prunes
and
Prism
school
excessively
polite
to
her
,
but
not
very
intimate
with
her
;
and
Little
Dorrit
,
as
an
enforced
sizar
of
that
college
,
was
obliged
to
submit
herself
humbly
to
its
ordinances
.
   
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
there
was
a
sympathetic
understanding
already
established
between
the
two
,
which
would
have
carried
them
over
greater
difficulties
,
and
made
a
friendship
out
of
a
more
restricted
intercourse
.
 
<EOS>
As
though
accidents
were
determined
to
be
favourable
to
it
,
they
had
a
new
assurance
of
congeniality
in
the
aversion
which
each
perceived
that
the
other
felt
towards
Blandois
of
Paris
;
an
aversion
amounting
to
the
repugnance
and
horror
of
a
natural
antipathy
towards
an
odious
creature
of
the
reptile
kind
.
   
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
passive
congeniality
between
them
,
besides
this
active
one
.
 
<EOS>
To
both
of
them
,
Blandois
behaved
in
exactly
the
same
manner
;
and
to
both
of
them
his
manner
had
uniformly
something
in
it
,
which
they
both
knew
to
be
different
from
his
bearing
towards
others
.
 
<EOS>
The
difference
was
too
minute
in
its
expression
to
be
perceived
by
others
,
but
they
knew
it
to
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
A
mere
trick
of
his
evil
eyes
,
a
mere
turn
of
his
smooth
white
hand
,
a
mere
hair's
-
breadth
of
addition
to
the
fall
of
his
nose
and
the
rise
of
the
moustache
in
the
most
frequent
movement
of
his
face
,
conveyed
to
both
of
them
,
equally
,
a
swagger
personal
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
he
had
said
,
"
I
have
a
secret
power
in
this
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
had
never
been
felt
by
them
both
in
so
great
a
degree
,
and
never
by
each
so
perfectly
to
the
knowledge
of
the
other
,
as
on
a
day
when
he
came
to
Mr
Dorrit
's
to
take
his
leave
before
quitting
Venice
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
was
herself
there
for
the
same
purpose
,
and
he
came
upon
the
two
together
;
the
rest
of
the
family
being
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
had
not
been
together
five
minutes
,
and
the
peculiar
manner
seemed
to
convey
to
them
,
"
You
were
going
to
talk
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Behold
me
here
to
prevent
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gowan
is
coming
here
?
"
said
Blandois
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
replied
he
was
not
coming
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
coming
!
"
said
Blandois
.
 
<EOS>
"
Permit
your
devoted
servant
,
when
you
leave
here
,
to
escort
you
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
:
I
am
not
going
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
going
home
!
"
said
Blandois
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
forlorn
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
he
might
be
;
but
he
was
not
so
forlorn
as
to
roam
away
and
leave
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
entertaining
them
with
his
finest
compliments
,
and
his
choicest
conversation
;
but
he
conveyed
to
them
,
all
the
time
,
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
dear
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Behold
me
here
expressly
to
prevent
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
conveyed
it
to
them
with
so
much
meaning
,
and
he
had
such
a
diabolical
persistency
in
him
,
that
at
length
,
Mrs
Gowan
rose
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
offering
his
hand
to
Mrs
Gowan
to
lead
her
down
the
staircase
,
she
retained
Little
Dorrit
's
hand
in
hers
,
with
a
cautious
pressure
,
and
said
,
"
No
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
will
please
to
see
if
my
boatman
is
there
,
I
shall
be
obliged
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
left
him
no
choice
but
to
go
down
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
hat
in
hand
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Gowan
whispered
:
   
"
<EOS>
He
killed
the
dog
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
Mr
Gowan
know
it
?
"
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
whispered
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
knows
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
towards
me
;
look
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
turn
his
face
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
knows
it
,
but
I
am
sure
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
think
so
,
"
Little
Dorrit
answered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Henry
likes
him
,
and
he
will
not
think
ill
of
him
;
he
is
so
generous
and
open
himself
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
and
I
feel
sure
that
we
think
of
him
as
he
deserves
.
 
<EOS>
He
argued
with
Henry
that
the
dog
had
been
already
poisoned
when
he
changed
so
,
and
sprang
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
believes
it
,
but
we
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
he
is
listening
,
but
ca
n't
hear
.
   
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
my
love
!
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
last
words
were
spoken
aloud
,
as
the
vigilant
Blandois
stopped
,
turned
his
head
,
and
looked
at
them
from
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
Assuredly
he
did
look
then
,
though
he
looked
his
politest
,
as
if
any
real
philanthropist
could
have
desired
no
better
employment
than
to
lash
a
great
stone
to
his
neck
,
and
drop
him
into
the
water
flowing
beyond
the
dark
arched
gateway
in
which
he
stood
.
 
<EOS>
No
such
benefactor
to
mankind
being
on
the
spot
,
he
handed
Mrs
Gowan
to
her
boat
,
and
stood
there
until
it
had
shot
out
of
the
narrow
view
;
when
he
handed
himself
into
his
own
boat
and
followed
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
had
sometimes
thought
,
and
now
thought
again
as
she
retraced
her
steps
up
the
staircase
,
that
he
had
made
his
way
too
easily
into
her
father
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
so
many
and
such
varieties
of
people
did
the
same
,
through
Mr
Dorrit
's
participation
in
his
elder
daughter
's
society
mania
,
that
it
was
hardly
an
exceptional
case
.
<EOS>
A
perfect
fury
for
making
acquaintances
on
whom
to
impress
their
riches
and
importance
,
had
seized
the
House
of
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
It
appeared
on
the
whole
,
to
Little
Dorrit
herself
,
that
this
same
society
in
which
they
lived
,
greatly
resembled
a
superior
sort
of
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
Numbers
of
people
seemed
to
come
abroad
,
pretty
much
as
people
had
come
into
the
prison
;
through
debt
,
through
idleness
,
relationship
,
curiosity
,
and
general
unfitness
for
getting
on
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
brought
into
these
foreign
towns
in
the
custody
of
couriers
and
local
followers
,
just
as
the
debtors
had
been
brought
into
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
They
prowled
about
the
churches
and
picture
-
galleries
,
much
in
the
old
,
dreary
,
prison
-
yard
manner
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
usually
going
away
again
to
-
morrow
or
next
week
,
and
rarely
knew
their
own
minds
,
and
seldom
did
what
they
said
they
would
do
,
or
went
where
they
said
they
would
go
:
in
all
this
again
,
very
like
the
prison
debtors
.
 
<EOS>
They
paid
high
for
poor
accommodation
,
and
disparaged
a
place
while
they
pretended
to
like
it
:
which
was
exactly
the
Marshalsea
custom
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
envied
when
they
went
away
by
people
left
behind
,
feigning
not
to
want
to
go
:
and
that
again
was
the
Marshalsea
habit
invariably
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
set
of
words
and
phrases
,
as
much
belonging
to
tourists
as
the
College
and
the
Snuggery
belonged
to
the
jail
,
was
always
in
their
mouths
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
precisely
the
same
incapacity
for
settling
down
to
anything
,
as
the
prisoners
used
to
have
;
they
rather
deteriorated
one
another
,
as
the
prisoners
used
to
do
;
and
they
wore
untidy
dresses
,
and
fell
into
a
slouching
way
of
life
:
still
,
always
like
the
people
in
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
The
period
of
the
family
's
stay
at
Venice
came
,
in
its
course
,
to
an
end
,
and
they
moved
,
with
their
retinue
,
to
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
Through
a
repetition
of
the
former
Italian
scenes
,
growing
more
dirty
and
more
haggard
as
they
went
on
,
and
bringing
them
at
length
to
where
the
very
air
was
diseased
,
they
passed
to
their
destination
.
 
<EOS>
A
fine
residence
had
been
taken
for
them
on
the
Corso
,
and
there
they
took
up
their
abode
,
in
a
city
where
everything
seemed
to
be
trying
to
stand
still
for
ever
on
the
ruins
of
something
else
---
except
the
water
,
which
,
following
eternal
laws
,
tumbled
and
rolled
from
its
glorious
multitude
of
fountains
.
   
<EOS>
Here
it
seemed
to
Little
Dorrit
that
a
change
came
over
the
Marshalsea
spirit
of
their
society
,
and
that
Prunes
and
Prism
got
the
upper
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
was
walking
about
St
Peter
's
and
the
Vatican
on
somebody
else
's
cork
legs
,
and
straining
every
visible
object
through
somebody
else
's
sieve
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
said
what
anything
was
,
but
everybody
said
what
the
Mrs
Generals
,
Mr
Eustace
,
or
somebody
else
said
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
body
of
travellers
seemed
to
be
a
collection
of
voluntary
human
sacrifices
,
bound
hand
and
foot
,
and
delivered
over
to
Mr
Eustace
and
his
attendants
,
to
have
the
entrails
of
their
intellects
arranged
according
to
the
taste
of
that
sacred
priesthood
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
rugged
remains
of
temples
and
tombs
and
palaces
and
senate
halls
and
theatres
and
amphitheatres
of
ancient
days
,
hosts
of
tongue
-
tied
and
blindfolded
moderns
were
carefully
feeling
their
way
,
incessantly
repeating
Prunes
and
Prism
in
the
endeavour
to
set
their
lips
according
to
the
received
form
.
<EOS>
Mrs
General
was
in
her
pure
element
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
had
an
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
formation
of
surface
going
on
around
her
on
an
amazing
scale
,
and
it
had
not
a
flaw
of
courage
or
honest
free
speech
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
Another
modification
of
Prunes
and
Prism
insinuated
itself
on
Little
Dorrit
's
notice
very
shortly
after
their
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
They
received
an
early
visit
from
Mrs
Merdle
,
who
led
that
extensive
department
of
life
in
the
Eternal
City
that
winter
;
and
the
skilful
manner
in
which
she
and
Fanny
fenced
with
one
another
on
the
occasion
,
almost
made
her
quiet
sister
wink
,
like
the
glittering
of
small
-
swords
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
delighted
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
to
resume
an
acquaintance
so
inauspiciously
begun
at
Martigny
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
At
Martigny
,
of
course
,
"
said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charmed
,
I
am
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
from
my
son
Edmund
Sparkler
,
that
he
has
already
improved
that
chance
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
returned
quite
transported
with
Venice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
"
returned
the
careless
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
he
there
long
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
might
refer
that
question
to
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
turning
the
bosom
towards
that
gentleman
;
"
Edmund
having
been
so
much
indebted
to
him
for
rendering
his
stay
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pray
do
n't
speak
of
it
,
"
returned
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
Papa
had
the
pleasure
of
inviting
Mr
Sparkler
twice
or
thrice
,
---
but
it
was
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
so
many
people
about
us
,
and
kept
such
open
house
,
that
if
he
had
that
pleasure
,
it
was
less
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Except
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
except
---
ha
---
as
it
afforded
me
unusual
gratification
to
---
hum

show
by
any
means
,
however
slight
and
worthless
,
the

high
estimation

common
with
the

of
the
world
,
I
hold
so
distinguished
and
princely
a
character
as
Mr
Merdle
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
bosom
received
this
tribute
in
its
most
engaging
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Merdle
,
"
observed
Fanny
,
as
a
means
of
dismissing
Mr
Sparkler
into
the
background
,
"
is
quite
a
theme
of
Papa
's
,
you
must
know
,
Mrs
Merdle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
---
ha
---
disappointed
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
to
understand
from
Mr
Sparkler
that
there
is
no
great
---
hum
---
probability
of
Mr
Merdle
's
coming
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
he
is
so
much
engaged
and
in
such
request
,
<EOS>
that
I
fear
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
not
been
able
to
get
abroad
for
years
.
 
<EOS>
You
,
Miss
Dorrit
<EOS>
,
I
believe
have
been
almost
continually
abroad
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
<EOS>
yes
,
"
drawled
Fanny
,
with
the
greatest
hardihood
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
immense
number
of
years
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
should
have
inferred
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
,
"
said
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
however
,
"
resumed
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
that
if
I
have
not
the
---
hum
---
great
advantage
of
becoming
known
to
Mr
Merdle
on
this
side
of
the
Alps
or
Mediterranean
,
I
shall
have
that
honour
on
returning
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
honour
I
particularly
desire
and
shall
particularly
esteem
.
"
<EOS>
"
Mr
Merdle
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
who
had
been
looking
admiringly
at
Fanny
through
her
eye
-
glass
,
"
will
esteem
it
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
no
less
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
still
habitually
thoughtful
and
solitary
though
no
longer
alone
,
at
first
supposed
this
to
be
mere
Prunes
and
Prism
.
<EOS>
But
as
her
father
when
they
had
been
to
a
brilliant
reception
at
Mrs
Merdle
's
,
harped
at
their
own
family
breakfast
-
table
on
his
wish
to
know
Mr
Merdle
,
with
the
contingent
view
of
benefiting
by
the
advice
of
that
wonderful
man
in
the
disposal
of
his
fortune
,
she
began
to
think
it
had
a
real
meaning
,
and
to
entertain
a
curiosity
on
her
own
part
to
see
the
shining
light
of
the
time

The
Dowager
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
is
reminded
that
"
It
Never
Does
"
 
While
the
waters
of
Venice
and
the
ruins
of
Rome
were
sunning
themselves
for
the
pleasure
of
the
Dorrit
family
,
and
were
daily
being
sketched
out
of
all
earthly
proportion
,
lineament
,
and
likeness
,
by
travelling
pencils
innumerable
,
the
firm
of
Doyce
and
Clennam
hammered
away
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
and
the
vigorous
clink
of
iron
upon
iron
was
heard
there
through
the
working
hours
.
   
<EOS>
The
younger
partner
had
,
by
this
time
,
brought
the
business
into
sound
trim
;
and
the
elder
,
left
free
to
follow
his
own
ingenious
devices
,
had
done
much
to
enhance
the
character
of
the
factory
.
 
<EOS>
As
an
ingenious
man
,
he
had
necessarily
to
encounter
every
discouragement
that
the
ruling
powers
for
a
length
of
time
had
been
able
by
any
means
to
put
in
the
way
of
this
class
of
culprits
;
but
that
was
only
reasonable
self
-
defence
in
the
powers
,
since
How
to
do
it
must
obviously
be
regarded
as
the
natural
and
mortal
enemy
of
How
not
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
was
to
be
found
the
basis
of
the
wise
system
,
by
tooth
and
nail
upheld
by
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
of
warning
every
ingenious
British
subject
to
be
ingenious
at
his
peril
:
of
harassing
him
,
obstructing
him
,
inviting
robbers
(
by
making
his
remedy
uncertain
,
and
expensive
)
to
plunder
him
,
and
at
the
best
of
confiscating
his
property
after
a
short
term
of
enjoyment
,
as
though
invention
were
on
a
par
with
felony
.
 
<EOS>
The
system
had
uniformly
found
great
favour
with
the
Barnacles
,
and
that
was
only
reasonable
,
too
;
for
one
who
worthily
invents
must
be
in
earnest
,
and
the
Barnacles
abhorred
and
dreaded
nothing
half
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
That
again
was
very
reasonable
;
since
in
a
country
suffering
under
the
affliction
of
a
great
amount
of
earnestness
,
there
might
,
in
an
exceeding
short
space
of
time
,
be
not
a
single
Barnacle
left
sticking
to
a
post
.
   
<EOS>
Daniel
Doyce
faced
his
condition
with
its
pains
and
penalties
attached
to
it
,
and
soberly
worked
on
for
the
work
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
cheering
him
with
a
hearty
co
-
operation
,
was
a
moral
support
to
him
,
besides
doing
good
service
in
his
business
relation
.
 
<EOS>
The
concern
prospered
,
and
the
partners
were
fast
friends
.
<EOS>
But
Daniel
could
not
forget
the
old
design
of
so
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
reason
to
be
expected
that
he
should
;
if
he
could
have
lightly
forgotten
it
,
he
could
never
have
conceived
it
,
or
had
the
patience
and
perseverance
to
work
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
So
Clennam
thought
,
when
he
sometimes
observed
him
of
an
evening
looking
over
the
models
and
drawings
,
and
consoling
himself
by
muttering
with
a
sigh
as
he
put
them
away
again
,
that
the
thing
was
as
true
as
it
ever
was
.
   
<EOS>
To
show
no
sympathy
with
so
much
endeavour
,
and
so
much
disappointment
,
would
have
been
to
fail
in
what
Clennam
regarded
as
among
the
implied
obligations
of
his
partnership
.
 
<EOS>
A
revival
of
the
passing
interest
in
the
subject
which
had
been
by
chance
awakened
at
the
door
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
originated
in
this
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
his
partner
to
explain
the
invention
to
him
;
"
having
a
lenient
consideration
,
"
he
stipulated
,
"
for
my
being
no
workman
,
Doyce
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
workman
?
<EOS>
"
said
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
been
a
thorough
workman
if
you
had
given
yourself
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
as
good
a
head
for
understanding
such
things
as
I
have
met
with
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
totally
uneducated
one
,
I
am
sorry
to
add
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
returned
Doyce
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
you
say
that
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
of
sense
who
has
been
generally
improved
,
and
has
improved
himself
,
can
be
called
quite
uneducated
as
to
anything
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
particularly
favour
mysteries
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
,
on
a
fair
and
clear
explanation
,
be
judged
by
one
class
of
man
as
another
,
<EOS>
provided
he
had
the
qualification
I
have
named
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
"
said
Clennam
---
"
<EOS>
this
sounds
as
if
we
were
exchanging
compliments
,
but
we
know
we
are
not
<EOS>
---
I
shall
have
the
advantage
of
as
plain
an
explanation
as
can
be
given
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Daniel
,
in
his
steady
even
way
,
"
I
'll
try
to
make
it
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
the
power
,
often
to
be
found
in
union
with
such
a
character
,
of
explaining
what
he
himself
perceived
,
and
meant
,
with
the
direct
force
and
distinctness
with
which
it
struck
his
own
mind
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
of
demonstration
was
so
orderly
and
neat
and
simple
,
that
it
was
not
easy
to
mistake
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
almost
ludicrous
in
the
complete
irreconcilability
of
a
vague
conventional
notion
that
he
must
be
a
visionary
man
,
with
the
precise
,
sagacious
travelling
of
his
eye
and
thumb
over
the
plans
,
their
patient
stoppages
at
particular
points
,
their
careful
returns
to
other
points
whence
little
channels
of
explanation
had
to
be
traced
up
,
and
his
steady
manner
of
making
everything
good
and
everything
sound
at
each
important
stage
,
before
taking
his
hearer
on
a
line's
-
breadth
further
.
 
<EOS>
His
dismissal
of
himself
from
his
description
,
was
hardly
less
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
said
,
I
discovered
this
adaptation
or
invented
that
combination
;
but
showed
the
whole
thing
as
if
the
Divine
artificer
had
made
it
,
and
he
had
happened
to
find
it
;
so
modest
he
was
about
it
,
such
a
pleasant
touch
of
respect
was
mingled
with
his
quiet
admiration
of
it
,
and
so
calmly
convinced
he
was
that
it
was
established
on
irrefragable
laws
.
   
<EOS>
Not
only
that
evening
,
but
for
several
succeeding
evenings
,
Clennam
was
quite
charmed
by
this
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
he
pursued
it
,
and
the
oftener
he
glanced
at
the
grey
head
bending
over
it
,
and
the
shrewd
eye
kindling
with
pleasure
in
it
and
love
of
it
---
instrument
for
probing
his
heart
though
it
had
been
made
for
twelve
long
years
---
the
less
he
could
reconcile
it
to
his
younger
energy
to
let
it
go
without
one
effort
more
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
said
:
   
"
Doyce
,
it
came
to
this
at
last
---
that
the
business
was
to
be
sunk
with
Heaven
<EOS>
knows
how
many
more
wrecks
,
or
begun
all
over
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Doyce
,
"
that
's
what
the
noblemen
and
gentlemen
made
of
it
after
a
dozen
years
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
pretty
fellows
too
!
"
said
Clennam
,
bitterly
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
usual
thing
!
<EOS>
"
observed
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
make
a
martyr
of
myself
,
when
I
am
one
of
so
large
a
company
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Relinquish
it
,
or
begin
it
all
over
again
?
"
mused
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
exactly
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
,
"
said
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
friend
,
"
cried
Clennam
,
starting
up
and
taking
his
work
-
roughened
hand
,
"
it
shall
be
begun
all
over
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
Doyce
looked
alarmed
,
and
replied
in
a
hurry
---
for
him
,
"
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
Better
put
it
by
.
 
<EOS>
Far
better
put
it
by
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
heard
of
,
one
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
put
it
by
.
 
<EOS>
You
forget
,
my
good
Clennam
;
I
HAVE
put
it
by
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Doyce
,
"
returned
Clennam
,
"
at
an
end
as
far
as
your
efforts
and
rebuffs
are
concerned
,
I
admit
,
but
not
as
far
as
mine
are
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
younger
than
you
:
<EOS>
I
have
only
once
set
foot
in
that
precious
office
,
and
I
am
fresh
game
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
do
exactly
as
you
have
been
doing
since
we
have
been
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
add
(
as
I
easily
can
)
to
what
I
have
been
doing
,
the
attempt
to
get
public
justice
done
to
you
;
and
,
unless
I
have
some
success
to
report
,
you
shall
hear
no
more
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Daniel
Doyce
was
still
reluctant
to
consent
,
and
again
and
again
urged
that
they
had
better
put
it
by
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
natural
that
he
should
gradually
allow
himself
to
be
over
-
persuaded
by
Clennam
,
and
should
yield
.
 
<EOS>
Yield
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
So
Arthur
resumed
the
long
and
hopeless
labour
of
striving
to
make
way
with
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
   
<EOS>
The
waiting
-
rooms
of
that
Department
soon
began
to
be
familiar
with
his
presence
,
and
he
was
generally
ushered
into
them
by
its
janitors
much
as
a
pickpocket
might
be
shown
into
a
police
-
office
;
the
principal
difference
being
that
the
object
of
the
latter
class
of
public
business
is
to
keep
the
pickpocket
,
while
the
Circumlocution
object
was
to
get
rid
of
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
was
resolved
to
stick
to
the
Great
Department
;
and
so
the
work
of
form
-
filling
,
corresponding
,
minuting
,
memorandum
-
making
,
signing
,
counter
-
signing
,
counter
-
counter
-
signing
,
referring
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
referring
sideways
,
crosswise
,
and
zig
-
zag
,
recommenced
.
   
<EOS>
Here
arises
a
feature
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
not
previously
mentioned
in
the
present
record
.
 
<EOS>
When
that
admirable
Department
got
into
trouble
,
and
was
,
by
some
infuriated
members
of
Parliament
whom
the
smaller
Barnacles
almost
suspected
of
labouring
under
diabolic
possession
,
attacked
on
the
merits
of
no
individual
case
,
but
as
an
Institution
wholly
abominable
and
Bedlamite
;
then
the
noble
or
right
honourable
Barnacle
who
represented
it
in
the
House
,
would
smite
that
member
and
cleave
him
asunder
,
with
a
statement
of
the
quantity
of
business
(
for
the
prevention
of
business
)
done
by
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
Then
would
that
noble
or
right
honourable
Barnacle
hold
in
his
hand
a
paper
containing
a
few
figures
,
to
which
,
with
the
permission
of
the
House
,
he
would
entreat
its
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Then
would
the
inferior
Barnacles
exclaim
,
obeying
orders
,
"
Hear
,
Hear
,
Hear
!
"
and
"
Read
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
would
the
noble
or
right
honourable
Barnacle
perceive
,
sir
,
from
this
little
document
,
which
he
thought
might
carry
conviction
even
to
the
perversest
mind
(
Derisive
laughter
and
cheering
from
the
Barnacle
fry
)
,
that
within
the
short
compass
of
the
last
financial
half
-
year
,
this
much
-
maligned
Department
(
Cheers
)
had
written
and
received
fifteen
thousand
letters
(
Loud
cheers
)
,
had
written
twenty
-
four
thousand
minutes
(
Louder
cheers
)
,
and
thirty
-
two
thousand
five
hundred
and
seventeen
memoranda
(
Vehement
cheering
)
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
an
ingenious
gentleman
connected
with
the
Department
,
and
himself
a
valuable
public
servant
,
had
done
him
the
favour
to
make
a
curious
calculation
of
the
amount
of
stationery
consumed
in
it
during
the
same
period
.
 
<EOS>
It
formed
a
part
of
this
same
short
document
;
and
he
derived
from
it
the
remarkable
fact
that
the
sheets
of
foolscap
paper
it
had
devoted
to
the
public
service
would
pave
the
footways
on
both
sides
of
Oxford
Street
from
end
to
end
,
and
leave
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
spare
for
the
park
(
Immense
cheering
and
laughter
)
;
while
of
tape
---
red
tape
---
it
had
used
enough
to
stretch
,
in
graceful
festoons
,
from
Hyde
Park
Corner
to
the
General
Post
Office
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
amidst
a
burst
of
official
exultation
,
would
the
noble
or
right
honourable
Barnacle
sit
down
,
leaving
the
mutilated
fragments
of
the
Member
on
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
,
after
that
exemplary
demolition
of
him
,
would
have
the
hardihood
to
hint
that
the
more
the
Circumlocution
Office
did
,
the
less
was
done
,
and
that
the
greatest
blessing
it
could
confer
on
an
unhappy
public
would
be
to
do
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
With
sufficient
occupation
on
his
hands
,
now
that
he
had
this
additional
task
---
such
a
task
had
many
and
many
a
serviceable
man
died
of
before
his
day
---
Arthur
Clennam
led
a
life
of
slight
variety
.
 
<EOS>
Regular
visits
to
his
mother
's
dull
sick
room
,
and
visits
scarcely
less
regular
to
Mr
Meagles
at
Twickenham
,
were
its
only
changes
during
many
months
.
   
<EOS>
He
sadly
and
sorely
missed
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
prepared
to
miss
her
very
much
,
but
not
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
to
the
full
extent
only
through
experience
,
what
a
large
place
in
his
life
was
left
blank
when
her
familiar
little
figure
went
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
,
too
,
that
he
must
relinquish
the
hope
of
its
return
,
understanding
the
family
character
sufficiently
well
to
be
assured
that
he
and
she
were
divided
by
a
broad
ground
of
separation
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
interest
he
had
had
in
her
,
and
her
old
trusting
reliance
on
him
,
were
tinged
with
melancholy
in
his
mind
:
so
soon
had
change
stolen
over
them
,
and
so
soon
had
they
glided
into
the
past
with
other
secret
tendernesses
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
received
her
letter
he
was
greatly
moved
,
but
did
not
the
less
sensibly
feel
that
she
was
far
divided
from
him
by
more
than
distance
.
 
<EOS>
It
helped
him
to
a
clearer
and
keener
perception
of
the
place
assigned
him
by
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
that
he
was
cherished
in
her
grateful
remembrance
secretly
,
and
that
they
resented
him
with
the
jail
and
the
rest
of
its
belongings
.
   
<EOS>
Through
all
these
meditations
which
every
day
of
his
life
crowded
about
her
,
he
thought
of
her
otherwise
in
the
old
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
his
innocent
friend
,
his
delicate
child
,
his
dear
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
This
very
change
of
circumstances
fitted
curiously
in
with
the
habit
,
begun
on
the
night
when
the
roses
floated
away
,
of
considering
himself
as
a
much
older
man
than
his
years
really
made
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
regarded
her
from
a
point
of
view
which
in
its
remoteness
,
tender
as
it
was
,
he
little
thought
would
have
been
unspeakable
agony
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
speculated
about
her
future
destiny
,
and
about
the
husband
she
might
have
,
with
an
affection
for
her
which
would
have
drained
her
heart
of
its
dearest
drop
of
hope
,
and
broken
it
.
   
<EOS>
Everything
about
him
tended
to
confirm
him
in
the
custom
of
looking
on
himself
as
an
elderly
man
,
from
whom
such
aspirations
as
he
had
combated
in
the
case
of
Minnie
Gowan
(
though
that
was
not
so
long
ago
either
,
reckoning
by
months
and
seasons
)
,
were
finally
departed
.
 
<EOS>
His
relations
with
her
father
and
mother
were
like
those
on
which
a
widower
son
-
in
-
law
might
have
stood
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
twin
sister
who
was
dead
had
lived
to
pass
away
in
the
bloom
of
womanhood
,
and
he
had
been
her
husband
,
the
nature
of
his
intercourse
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
would
probably
have
been
just
what
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
This
imperceptibly
helped
to
render
habitual
the
impression
within
him
,
that
he
had
done
with
,
and
dismissed
that
part
of
life
.
   
<EOS>
He
invariably
heard
of
Minnie
from
them
,
as
telling
them
in
her
letters
how
happy
she
was
,
and
how
she
loved
her
husband
;
but
inseparable
from
that
subject
,
he
invariably
saw
the
old
cloud
on
Mr
Meagles
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
had
never
been
quite
so
radiant
since
the
marriage
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
quite
recovered
the
separation
from
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
same
good
-
humoured
,
open
creature
;
but
as
if
his
face
,
from
being
much
turned
towards
the
pictures
of
his
two
children
which
could
show
him
only
one
look
,
unconsciously
adopted
a
characteristic
from
them
,
it
always
had
now
,
through
all
its
changes
of
expression
,
a
look
of
loss
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
One
wintry
Saturday
when
Clennam
was
at
the
cottage
,
the
Dowager
Mrs
Gowan
drove
up
,
in
the
Hampton
Court
equipage
which
pretended
to
be
the
exclusive
equipage
of
so
many
individual
proprietors
.
<EOS>
She
descended
,
in
her
shady
ambuscade
of
green
fan
,
to
favour
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
with
a
call
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
both
do
,
Papa
and
Mama
Meagles
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
encouraging
her
humble
connections
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
when
did
you
last
hear
from
or
about
my
poor
fellow
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
poor
fellow
was
her
son
;
and
this
mode
of
speaking
of
him
politely
kept
alive
,
without
any
offence
in
the
world
,
the
pretence
that
he
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
Meagles
'
wiles
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
dear
pretty
one
?
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
later
news
of
her
than
I
have
?
"
   
<EOS>
Which
also
delicately
implied
that
her
son
had
been
captured
by
mere
beauty
,
and
under
its
fascination
had
forgone
all
sorts
of
worldly
advantages
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
without
straining
her
attention
on
the
answers
she
received
,
"
it
's
an
unspeakable
comfort
to
know
they
continue
happy
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
fellow
is
of
such
a
restless
disposition
,
and
has
been
so
used
to
roving
about
,
and
to
being
inconstant
and
popular
among
all
manner
of
people
,
that
it
's
the
greatest
comfort
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
're
as
poor
as
mice
,
Papa
Meagles
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
fidgety
under
the
question
,
replied
,
"
I
hope
not
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
they
will
manage
their
little
income
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
my
dearest
Meagles
!
"
returned
the
lady
,
tapping
him
on
the
arm
with
the
green
fan
and
then
adroitly
interposing
it
between
a
yawn
and
the
company
,
"
how
can
you
,
as
a
man
of
the
world
and
one
of
the
most
business
-
like
of
human
beings
---
for
you
know
you
are
business
-
like
,
and
a
great
deal
too
much
for
us
who
are
not
---
"
   
<EOS>
(
Which
went
to
the
former
purpose
,
by
making
Mr
Meagles
out
to
be
an
artful
schemer
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
---
How
can
you
talk
about
their
managing
their
little
means
?
 
<EOS>
My
poor
dear
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
his
managing
hundreds
!
 
<EOS>
And
the
sweet
pretty
creature
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
notion
of
her
managing
!
 
<EOS>
Papa
Meagles
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
gravely
,
"
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
admit
,
then
,
that
Henry
certainly
does
anticipate
his
means
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
good
man
---
I
use
no
ceremony
with
you
,
because
we
are
a
kind
of
relations
;
---
positively
,
Mama
Meagles
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Gowan
cheerfully
,
as
if
the
absurd
coincidence
then
flashed
upon
her
for
the
first
time
,
"
a
kind
of
relations
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
good
man
,
in
this
world
none
of
us
can
have
everything
our
own
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
again
went
to
the
former
point
,
and
showed
Mr
Meagles
with
all
good
breeding
that
,
so
far
,
he
had
been
brilliantly
successful
in
his
deep
designs
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
thought
the
hit
so
good
<EOS>
a
one
,
that
she
dwelt
upon
it
<EOS>
;
repeating
"
Not
everything
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
in
this
world
we
must
not
expect
everything
,
Papa
Meagles
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
may
I
ask
,
ma'am
,
"
retorted
Mr
Meagles
,
a
little
heightened
in
colour
,
"
who
does
expect
everything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nobody
,
nobody
!
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
say
---
but
you
put
me
out
.
 
<EOS>
You
interrupting
Papa
,
what
was
I
going
to
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
Drooping
her
large
green
fan
,
she
looked
musingly
at
Mr
Meagles
while
she
thought
about
it
;
a
performance
not
tending
to
the
cooling
of
that
gentleman
's
rather
heated
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
be
sure
!
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
remember
that
my
poor
fellow
has
always
been
accustomed
to
expectations
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
have
been
realised
,
or
they
may
not
have
been
realised
---
"
   
"
Let
us
say
,
then
,
may
not
have
been
realised
,
"
observed
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
The
Dowager
for
a
moment
gave
him
an
angry
look
;
but
tossed
it
off
with
her
head
and
her
fan
,
and
pursued
the
tenor
of
her
way
in
her
former
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
makes
no
difference
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
fellow
has
been
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
thing
,
and
of
course
you
knew
it
,
and
were
prepared
for
the
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
I
myself
always
clearly
foresaw
the
consequences
,
and
am
not
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
must
not
be
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
In
fact
,
ca
n't
be
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
Must
have
been
prepared
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
looked
at
his
wife
and
at
Clennam
;
bit
his
lip
;
and
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
here
's
my
poor
fellow
,
"
Mrs
Gowan
pursued
,
"
receiving
notice
that
he
is
to
hold
himself
in
expectation
of
a
baby
,
and
all
the
expenses
attendant
on
such
an
addition
to
his
family
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Henry
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
ca
n't
be
helped
now
;
it
's
too
late
to
help
it
now
.
<EOS>
Only
do
n't
talk
of
anticipating
means
,
Papa
Meagles
,
as
a
discovery
;
because
that
would
be
too
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
much
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
as
seeking
an
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
!
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
putting
him
in
his
inferior
place
with
an
expressive
action
of
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Too
much
for
my
poor
fellow
's
mother
to
bear
at
this
time
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
fast
married
,
and
ca
n't
be
unmarried
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
there
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
!
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
tell
me
that
,
Papa
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
<EOS>
I
said
just
now
?
 
<EOS>
That
it
was
a
great
comfort
they
continued
happy
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
hoped
they
will
still
continue
happy
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
hoped
Pretty
One
will
do
everything
she
can
to
make
my
poor
fellow
happy
,
and
keep
him
contented
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
and
Mama
Meagles
<EOS>
,
we
had
better
say
no
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
did
look
at
this
subject
from
the
same
side
,
and
we
never
shall
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
there
!
 
<EOS>
Now
I
am
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
Truly
,
having
by
this
time
said
everything
she
could
say
in
maintenance
of
her
wonderfully
mythical
position
,
and
in
admonition
to
Mr
Meagles
that
he
must
not
expect
to
bear
his
honours
of
alliance
too
cheaply
,
Mrs
Gowan
was
disposed
to
forgo
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Meagles
had
submitted
to
a
glance
of
entreaty
from
Mrs
Meagles
,
and
an
expressive
gesture
from
Clennam
,
he
would
have
left
her
in
the
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
this
state
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
But
Pet
was
the
darling
and
pride
of
his
heart
;
and
if
he
could
ever
have
championed
her
more
devotedly
,
or
loved
her
better
,
than
in
the
days
when
she
was
the
sunlight
of
his
house
,
it
would
have
been
now
,
when
,
as
its
daily
grace
and
delight
,
she
was
lost
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Gowan
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
I
have
been
a
plain
man
all
my
life

<EOS>
If
I
was
to
try

no
matter
whether
on
myself
,
on
somebody
else
,

both

any
genteel
mystifications
,
I
should
probably
not
succeed
in
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Papa
Meagles
,
"
returned
the
Dowager
,
with
an
affable
smile
,
but
with
the
bloom
on
her
cheeks
standing
out
a
little
more
vividly
than
usual
as
the
neighbouring
surface
became
paler
,
"
probably
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
my
good
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
at
great
pains
to
restrain
himself
,
"
I
hope
I
may
,
without
offence
,
ask
to
have
no
such
mystification
played
off
upon
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
Mama
Meagles
,
"
observed
Mrs
Gowan
,
"
your
good
man
is
incomprehensible
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
turning
to
that
worthy
lady
was
an
artifice
to
bring
her
into
the
discussion
,
quarrel
with
her
,
and
vanquish
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
interposed
to
prevent
that
consummation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
he
,
"
you
are
inexpert

my

it

<EOS>
Let

you
to
remain
quiet

<EOS>
Come

Mrs
Gowan
,
come

<EOS>
Let

try

natured

sided

<EOS>
my

not

Do

say
that
we

Pet
will
make
Henry
happy

or
even
that

will
make

happy

(
Mr
Meagles
himself
did
not
look
happy
as
he
spoke
the
words
,
)
<EOS>
"
but
let
us
hope
they
will
make
each
other
happy

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sure
,
and
there
leave
it

father

"
said
Mrs
Meagles
the
kind
-
hearted
and
comfortable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
mother
,
no
,
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
,
"
not
exactly
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
quite
leave
it
there
;
I
must
say
just
half
-
a
-
dozen
words
more
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
,
I
hope
I
am
not
over
-
sensitive
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
do
n't
look
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
do
not

"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
shaking
her
head
and
the
great
green
fan
together
,
for
emphasis
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am

that
's
well

<EOS>
Notwithstanding
which
,
I
feel
a
little
---
I
do
n't
want
to
use
a
strong
word
---
now
shall
I
say
hurt
?
"
asked
Mr
Meagles
at
once
with
frankness
and
moderation
,
and
with
a
conciliatory
appeal
in
his
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
what
you
like
,
"
answered
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
perfectly
indifferent
to
me

"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
do
n't
say
that
,
"
urged
Mr
Meagles
,
"
because
that
's
not
responding
amiably
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
a
little
hurt
when
I
hear
references
made
to
consequences
having
been
foreseen

to
its

late

so
forth

"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
,
Papa
Meagles

"
said
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am

"
Well

"
reasoned
Mr
Meagles
,
"
<EOS>
I
was
in

surprised

to
hurt
me

tender
<EOS>
a

surely
not

I

said
Mrs

for

<EOS>
Poor
Mr

looked
aghast

astonishment

"

pursued
Mrs

"
do
n't
blame
me
for
its
pattern

Papa

Mrs

who
became
extremely
deliberate
and
prepossessing
in
manner
whenever
that

became
at
all
warm
,
"
perhaps
to
prevent
confusion

I
had
better
speak
for

trouble
your

not

I

for
it

of

my
only
wish
is
to
make
the
best
of
existing
circumstances
---
that
from
the
first
to
the
last
I
always
objected
to
this
match
of
yours
,
and
at
a
very
late
period
yielded
a
most
unwilling
consent
to
it

"

cried
Mr

"
The
room
being
of
a
convenient
size
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
looking
about
as
she
fanned
herself
,
"
and
quite
charmingly
adapted
in
all
respects
to
conversation
<EOS>
,
I
should
imagine
I
am
audible
in
any
part
of
it

"
   
<EOS>
Some
moments
passed
in
silence
,
before
Mr
Meagles
could
hold
himself
in
his
chair
with
sufficient
security
to
prevent
his
breaking
out
of
it
at
the
next
word
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
:
"
Ma'am
,
I
am
very
unwilling
to
revive
them
,
but
I
must
remind
you
what
my
opinions
and
my
course
were
,
all
along
,
on
that
unfortunate
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
my
dear
sir
!
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
with
accusatory
intelligence
,
"
they
were
well
understood
by
me
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
knew
unhappiness
before
that
time
,
I
never
knew
anxiety
before
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
time
of
such
distress
to
me
that
---
"
That
Mr
Meagles
could
really
say
no
more
about
it
,
in
short
,
but
passed
his
handkerchief
before
his
Face
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
understood
the
whole
affair
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
composedly
looking
over
her
fan
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
have
appealed
to
Mr
Clennam
,
I
may
appeal
to
Mr
Clennam
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
whether
I
did
or
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
unwilling
,
"
said
Clennam
,
looked
to
by
all
parties
,
"
to
take
any
share
in
this
discussion
,
more
especially
because
I
wish
to
preserve
the
best
understanding
and
the
clearest
relations
with
Mr
Henry
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
very
strong
reasons
indeed
,
for
entertaining
that
wish
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
attributed
certain
views
of
furthering
the
marriage
to
my
friend
here
,
in
conversation
with
me
before
it
took
place
;
and
I
endeavoured
to
undeceive
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
represented
that
I
knew
him
(
as
I
did
and
do
)
to
be
strenuously
opposed
to
it
,
both
in
opinion
and
action
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
?
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
turning
the
palms
of
her
hands
towards
Mr
Meagles
,
as
if
she
were
Justice
herself
,
representing
to
him
that
he
had
better
confess
,
for
he
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
?
 
<EOS>
Very
good
!
 
<EOS>
Now
Papa
and
Mama
Meagles
both
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
she
rose
;
"
allow
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
putting
an
end
to
this
rather
formidable
controversy
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
another
word
upon
its
merits
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
that
it
is
an
additional
proof
of
what
one
knows
from
all
experience
;
that
this
kind
of
thing
never
answers
---
as
my
poor
fellow
himself
would
say
,
that
it
never
pays
---
in
one
word
,
that
it
never
does
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
asked
,
What
kind
of
thing
?
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
in
vain
,
"
said
Mrs
Gowan
,
"
for
people
to
attempt
to
get
on
together
who
have
such
extremely
different
antecedents
;
who
are
jumbled
against
each
other
in
this
accidental
,
matrimonial
sort
of
way
;
and
who
can
not
look
at
the
untoward
circumstance
which
has
shaken
them
together
in
the
same
light
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
does
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
was
beginning
,
"
Permit
me
to
say
,
ma'am
---
"
   
"
No
,
do
n't
,
"
returned
Mrs
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
ascertained
fact
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
does
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
,
if
you
please
,
go
my
way
,
leaving
you
to
yours
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
at
all
times
be
happy
to
receive
my
poor
fellow
's
pretty
wife
,
and
I
shall
always
make
a
point
of
being
on
the
most
affectionate
terms
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
to
these
terms
,
semi
-
family
and
semi
-
stranger
,
semi
-
goring
and
semi
-
boring
,
they
form
a
state
of
things
quite
amusing
in
its
impracticability
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
never
does
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Dowager
here
made
a
smiling
obeisance
,
rather
to
the
room
than
to
any
one
in
it
,
and
therewith
took
a
final
farewell
of
Papa
and
Mama
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
stepped
forward
to
hand
her
to
the
Pill
-
Box
which
was
at
the
service
of
all
the
Pills
in
Hampton
Court
Palace
;
and
she
got
into
that
vehicle
with
distinguished
serenity
,
and
was
driven
away
.
   
<EOS>
Thenceforth
the
Dowager
,
with
a
light
and
careless
humour
,
often
recounted
to
her
particular
acquaintance
how
,
after
a
hard
trial
,
she
had
found
it
impossible
to
know
those
people
who
belonged
to
Henry
's
wife
,
and
who
had
made
that
desperate
set
to
catch
him
.
<EOS>
Whether
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
beforehand
,
that
to
get
rid
of
them
would
give
her
favourite
pretence
a
better
air
,
might
save
her
some
occasional
inconvenience
,
and
could
risk
no
loss
(
the
pretty
creature
being
fast
married
,
and
her
father
devoted
to
her
)
,
was
best
known
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Though
this
history
has
its
opinion
on
that
point
too
,
and
decidedly
in
the
affirmative

Appearance
and
Disappearance
 
"
Arthur
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
,
"
Mother
and
I
have
been
talking
this
over
,
and
we
do
n't
feel
comfortable
in
remaining
as
we
are
.
 
<EOS>
That
elegant
connection
of
ours
---
that
dear
lady
who
was
here
yesterday
---
"
   
"
I
understand
,
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Even
that
affable
and
condescending
ornament
of
society
,
"
pursued
Mr
Meagles
,
"
may
misrepresent
us
,
we
are
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
bear
a
great
deal
,
Arthur
,
for
her
sake
;
but
we
think
we
would
rather
not
bear
that
,
if
it
was
all
the
same
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
proceeded
Mr
Meagles
<EOS>
"
it
might
put
us
wrong
with
our
son
-
in
-
law
,
it
might
even
put
us
wrong
with
our
daughter
,
and
it
might
lead
to
a
great
deal
of
domestic
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
"
there
is
much
reason
in
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
had
glanced
at
Mrs
Meagles
,
who
was
always
on
the
good
and
sensible
side
;
and
a
petition
had
shone
out
of
her
honest
face
that
he
would
support
Mr
Meagles
in
his
present
inclinings
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
we
are
very
much
disposed
,
are
Mother
and
I
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
to
pack
up
bags
and
baggage
and
go
among
the
Allongers
and
Marshongers
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
we
are
very
much
disposed
to
be
off
,
strike
right
through
France
into
Italy
,
and
see
our
Pet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
think
,
"
replied
Arthur
,
touched
by
the
motherly
anticipation
in
the
bright
face
of
Mrs
Meagles
<EOS>
(
she
must
have
been
very
like
her
daughter
,
once
)
,
"
that
you
could
do
better
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
ask
me
for
my
advice
,
it
is
that
you
set
off
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
really
,
though
?
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
this
is
being
backed
in
an
idea
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mother
,
with
a
look
which
thanked
Clennam
in
a
manner
very
agreeable
to
him
,
answered
that
it
was
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
besides
,
Arthur
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
the
old
cloud
coming
over
his
face
,
"
that
my
son
-
in
-
law
is
already
in
debt
again
,
and
that
I
suppose
I
must
clear
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
as
well
,
even
on
this
account
,
that
I
should
step
over
there
,
and
look
him
up
in
a
friendly
way
.
 
<EOS>
Then
again
,
here
's
Mother
foolishly
anxious
(
and
yet
naturally
too
)
about
Pet
's
state
of
health
,
and
that
she
should
not
be
left
to
feel
lonesome
at
the
present
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
undeniably
a
long
way
off
,
Arthur
,
and
a
strange
place
for
the
poor
love
under
all
the
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
be
as
well
cared
for
as
any
lady
in
that
land
,
still
it
is
a
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
Home
is
Home
though
it
's
never
<EOS>
so
Homely
,
why
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
adding
a
new
version
to
the
proverb
,
"
Rome
is
Rome
,
though
it
's
never
so
Romely
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
perfectly
true
,
"
observed
Arthur
,
"
and
all
sufficient
reasons
for
going
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
think
so
;
it
decides
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
,
my
dear
,
you
may
get
ready
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
lost
our
pleasant
interpreter
<EOS>
(
she
spoke
three
foreign
languages
<EOS>
beautifully
,
Arthur
;
you
have
heard
her
many
a
time
)
,
and
you
must
pull
me
through
it
,
Mother
,
as
well
as
you
can
.
   
<EOS>
I
require
a
deal
of
pulling
through
,
Arthur
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
a
deal
of
pulling
through
.
 
<EOS>
I
stick
at
everything
beyond
a
noun
-
substantive
---
<EOS>
and
I
stick
at
him
,
if
he
's
at
all
a
tight
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
think
of
it
,
"
returned
Clennam
,
"
there
's
Cavalletto
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
go
with
you
,
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
afford
to
lose
him
,
but
you
will
bring
him
safe
back
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
my
boy
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
turning
it
over
,
"
but
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
think
I
'll
be
pulled
through
by
Mother
.
 
<EOS>
Cavallooro
(
I
stick
at
his
very
name
to
start
with
,
and
it
sounds
like
the
chorus
to
a
comic
song
)
is
so
necessary
to
you
,
that
I
do
n't
like
the
thought
of
taking
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
that
,
there
's
no
saying
when
we
may
come
home
again
;
and
it
would
never
do
to
take
him
away
for
an
indefinite
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
cottage
is
not
what
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
It
only
holds
two
little
people
less
than
it
ever
did
,
Pet
,
and
her
poor
unfortunate
maid
Tattycoram
;
but
it
seems
empty
now
.
 
<EOS>
Once
out
of
it
,
there
's
no
knowing
when
we
may
come
back
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Arthur
,
I
'll
be
pulled
through
by
Mother
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
would
do
best
by
themselves
perhaps
,
after
all
,
Clennam
thought
;
therefore
did
not
press
his
proposal
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
come
down
and
stay
here
for
a
change
,
when
it
would
n't
trouble
you
,
"
Mr
Meagles
resumed
,
"
I
should
be
glad
to
think
---
and
so
would
Mother
too
,
I
know
---
that
you
were
brightening
up
the
old
place
with
a
bit
of
life
it
was
used
to
when
it
was
full
,
and
that
the
Babies
on
the
wall
there
had
a
kind
eye
upon
them
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
You
so
belong
to
the
spot
,
and
to
them
,
Arthur
,
and
we
should
every
one
of
us
have
been
so
happy
if
it
had
fallen
out
---
<EOS>
but
,
let
us
see
<EOS>
---
how
's
the
weather
for
travelling
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
broke
off
,
cleared
his
throat
,
and
got
up
to
look
out
of
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
They
agreed
that
the
weather
was
of
high
promise
;
and
Clennam
kept
the
talk
in
that
safe
direction
until
it
had
become
easy
again
,
when
he
gently
diverted
it
to
Henry
Gowan
and
his
quick
sense
and
agreeable
qualities
when
he
was
delicately
dealt
With
;
he
likewise
dwelt
on
the
indisputable
affection
he
entertained
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Clennam
did
not
fail
of
his
effect
upon
good
Mr
Meagles
,
whom
these
commendations
greatly
cheered
;
and
who
took
Mother
to
witness
that
the
single
and
cordial
desire
of
his
heart
in
reference
to
their
daughter
's
husband
,
was
harmoniously
to
exchange
friendship
for
friendship
,
and
confidence
for
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Within
a
few
hours
the
cottage
furniture
began
to
be
wrapped
up
for
preservation
in
the
family
absence
---
or
,
as
Mr
Meagles
expressed
it
,
the
house
began
to
put
its
hair
in
papers
---
and
within
a
few
days
Father
and
Mother
were
gone
,
Mrs
Tickit
and
Dr
Buchan
were
posted
,
as
of
yore
,
behind
the
parlour
blind
,
and
Arthur
's
solitary
feet
were
rustling
among
the
dry
fallen
leaves
in
the
garden
walks
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
had
a
liking
for
the
spot
,
he
seldom
let
a
week
pass
without
paying
a
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
he
went
down
alone
from
Saturday
to
Monday
;
sometimes
his
partner
accompanied
him
;
sometimes
,
he
merely
strolled
for
an
hour
or
two
about
the
house
and
garden
,
saw
that
all
was
right
,
and
returned
to
London
again
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
times
,
and
under
all
circumstances
,
Mrs
Tickit
,
with
her
dark
row
of
curls
,
and
Dr
Buchan
,
sat
in
the
parlour
window
,
looking
out
for
the
family
return
.
   
<EOS>
On
one
of
his
visits
Mrs
Tickit
received
him
with
the
words
,
"
I
have
something
to
tell
you
,
Mr
Clennam
,
that
will
surprise
you
.
"
<EOS>
So
surprising
was
the
something
in
question
,
that
it
actually
brought
Mrs
Tickit
out
of
the
parlour
window
and
produced
her
in
the
garden
walk
,
when
Clennam
went
in
at
the
gate
on
its
being
opened
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Mrs
Tickit
?
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
that
faithful
housekeeper
,
having
taken
him
into
the
parlour
and
closed
the
door
;
"
if
ever
I
saw
the
led
away
and
deluded
child
in
my
life
,
I
saw
her
identically
in
the
dusk
of
yesterday
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
Tatty
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Coram
<EOS>
yes
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
quoth
Mrs
Tickit
,
clearing
the
disclosure
at
a
leap
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
?
"
   
"
Mr
Clennam
,
"
returned
Mrs
Tickit
,
"
I
was
a
little
heavy
in
my
eyes
,
being
that
I
was
waiting
longer
than
customary
for
my
cup
of
tea
which
was
then
preparing
by
Mary
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
sleeping
,
nor
what
a
person
would
term
correctly
,
dozing
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
more
what
a
person
would
strictly
call
watching
with
my
eyes
closed
.
"
   
<EOS>
Without
entering
upon
an
inquiry
into
this
curious
abnormal
condition
,
Clennam
said
,
"
Exactly
.
 
<EOS>
Well
?
"
   
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
proceeded
Mrs
Tickit
,
"
I
was
thinking
of
one
thing
and
thinking
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
you
yourself
might
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
anybody
might
.
"
<EOS>
"
Precisely
so
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
do
think
of
one
thing
and
do
think
of
another
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Tickit
,
"
I
hardly
need
to
tell
you
,
Mr
Clennam
,
that
I
think
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
a
person
's
thoughts
<EOS>
,
"
Mrs
Tickit
said
this
with
an
argumentative
and
philosophic
air
,
"
however
they
may
stray
,
will
go
more
or
less
on
what
is
uppermost
in
their
minds
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
do
it
,
sir
,
and
a
person
ca
n't
prevent
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
subscribed
to
this
discovery
with
a
nod
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
find
it
<EOS>
so
yourself
,
sir
,
I
'll
be
bold
to
say
,
"
said
Mrs
Tickit
,
"
and
we
all
find
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
an't
our
stations
in
life
that
changes
us
,
Mr
Clennam
;
thoughts
is
free
!
<EOS>
---
As
I
was
saying
,
I
was
thinking
of
one
thing
and
thinking
of
another
,
and
thinking
very
much
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Not
of
the
family
in
the
present
times
only
,
but
in
the
past
times
too
.
 
<EOS>
For
when
a
person
does
begin
thinking
of
one
thing
and
thinking
of
another
in
that
manner
,
as
it
's
getting
dark
,
what
I
say
is
,
that
all
times
seem
to
be
present
,
and
a
person
must
get
out
of
that
state
and
consider
before
they
can
say
which
is
which
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
nodded
again
;
afraid
to
utter
a
word
,
lest
it
should
present
any
new
opening
to
Mrs
Tickit
's
conversational
powers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
which
,
"
said
Mrs
Tickit
,
"
when
I
quivered
my
eyes
and
saw
her
actual
form
and
figure
looking
in
at
the
gate
,
I
let
them
close
again
without
so
much
as
starting
,
for
that
actual
form
and
figure
came
so
pat
to
the
time
when
it
belonged
to
the
house
as
much
as
mine
or
your
own
,
that
I
never
thought
at
the
moment
of
its
having
gone
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
when
I
quivered
my
eyes
again
,
and
saw
that
it
was
n't
there
,
then
it
all
flooded
upon
me
with
a
fright
,
and
I
jumped
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ran
out
directly
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ran
out
,
"
assented
Mrs
Tickit
,
"
as
fast
as
ever
my
feet
would
carry
me
;
and
if
you
'll
credit
it
,
Mr
Clennam
,
there
was
n't
in
the
whole
shining
Heavens
,
no
not
so
much
as
a
finger
of
that
young
woman
.
"
   
<EOS>
Passing
over
the
absence
from
the
firmament
of
this
novel
constellation
,
Arthur
inquired
of
Mrs
Tickit
if
she
herself
went
beyond
the
gate
?
   
<EOS>
"
Went
to
and
fro
,
and
high
and
low
,
"
said
Mrs
Tickit
,
"
and
saw
no
sign
of
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
then
asked
Mrs
Tickit
how
long
a
space
of
time
<EOS>
she
supposed
there
might
have
been
between
the
two
sets
of
ocular
quiverings
she
had
experienced
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tickit
,
though
minutely
circumstantial
in
her
reply
,
had
no
settled
opinion
between
five
seconds
and
ten
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
so
plainly
at
sea
on
this
part
of
the
case
,
and
had
so
clearly
been
startled
out
of
slumber
,
that
Clennam
was
much
disposed
to
regard
the
appearance
as
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
Without
hurting
Mrs
Tickit
's
feelings
with
that
infidel
solution
of
her
mystery
,
he
took
it
away
from
the
cottage
with
him
;
and
probably
would
have
retained
it
ever
afterwards
if
a
circumstance
had
not
soon
happened
to
change
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
was
passing
at
nightfall
along
the
Strand
,
and
the
lamp
-
lighter
was
going
on
before
him
,
under
whose
hand
the
street
-
lamps
,
blurred
by
the
foggy
air
,
burst
out
one
after
another
,
like
<EOS>
so
many
blazing
sunflowers
coming
into
full
-
blow
all
at
once
,
---
when
a
stoppage
on
the
pavement
,
caused
by
a
train
of
coal
-
waggons
toiling
up
from
the
wharves
at
the
river
-
side
,
brought
him
to
a
stand
-
still
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
walking
quickly
,
and
going
with
some
current
of
thought
,
and
the
sudden
check
given
to
both
operations
caused
him
to
look
freshly
about
him
,
as
people
under
such
circumstances
usually
do
.
   
<EOS>
Immediately
,
he
saw
in
advance
---
a
few
people
intervening
,
but
still
so
near
to
him
that
he
could
have
touched
them
by
stretching
out
his
arm
---
Tattycoram
and
a
strange
man
of
a
remarkable
appearance
:
a
swaggering
man
,
with
a
high
nose
,
and
a
black
moustache
as
false
in
its
colour
as
his
eyes
were
false
in
their
expression
,
who
wore
his
heavy
cloak
with
the
air
of
a
foreigner
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
and
general
appearance
were
those
of
a
man
on
travel
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
very
recently
joined
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
In
bending
down
(
being
much
taller
than
she
was
)
,
listening
to
whatever
she
said
to
him
,
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
with
the
suspicious
glance
of
one
who
was
not
unused
to
be
mistrustful
that
his
footsteps
might
be
dogged
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
Clennam
saw
his
face
;
as
his
eyes
lowered
on
the
people
behind
him
in
the
aggregate
,
without
particularly
resting
upon
Clennam
's
face
or
any
other
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
turned
his
head
about
again
,
and
it
was
still
bent
down
,
listening
to
the
girl
,
when
the
stoppage
ceased
,
and
the
obstructed
stream
of
people
flowed
on
.
 
<EOS>
Still
bending
his
head
and
listening
to
the
girl
,
he
went
on
at
her
side
,
and
Clennam
followed
them
,
resolved
to
play
this
unexpected
play
out
,
and
see
where
they
went
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
made
the
determination
(
though
he
was
not
long
about
it
)
,
when
he
was
again
as
suddenly
brought
up
as
he
had
been
by
the
stoppage
.
 
<EOS>
They
turned
short
into
the
Adelphi
,
---
the
girl
evidently
leading
,
---
and
went
straight
on
,
as
if
they
were
going
to
the
Terrace
which
overhangs
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
always
,
to
this
day
,
a
sudden
pause
in
that
place
to
the
roar
of
the
great
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
The
many
sounds
become
so
deadened
that
the
change
is
like
putting
cotton
in
the
ears
,
or
having
the
head
thickly
muffled
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
time
the
contrast
was
far
greater
;
there
being
no
small
steam
-
boats
on
the
river
,
no
landing
places
but
slippery
wooden
stairs
and
foot
-
causeways
,
no
railroad
on
the
opposite
bank
,
no
hanging
bridge
or
fish
-
market
near
at
hand
,
no
traffic
on
the
nearest
bridge
of
stone
,
nothing
moving
on
the
stream
<EOS>
but
watermen
's
wherries
and
coal
-
lighters
.
 
<EOS>
Long
and
broad
black
tiers
of
the
latter
,
moored
fast
in
the
mud
as
if
they
were
never
to
move
again
,
made
the
shore
funereal
and
silent
after
dark
;
and
kept
what
little
water
-
movement
there
was
,
far
out
towards
mid
-
stream
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
hour
later
than
sunset
,
and
not
least
at
that
hour
when
most
of
the
people
who
have
anything
to
eat
at
home
are
going
home
to
eat
it
,
and
when
most
of
those
who
have
nothing
have
hardly
yet
slunk
out
to
beg
or
steal
,
it
was
a
deserted
place
and
looked
on
a
deserted
scene
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
hour
when
Clennam
stopped
at
the
corner
,
observing
the
girl
and
the
strange
man
as
they
went
down
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
's
footsteps
were
so
noisy
on
the
echoing
stones
that
he
was
unwilling
to
add
the
sound
of
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
they
had
passed
the
turning
and
were
in
the
darkness
of
the
dark
corner
leading
to
the
terrace
,
he
made
after
them
with
such
indifferent
appearance
of
being
a
casual
passenger
on
his
way
,
as
he
could
assume
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
rounded
the
dark
corner
,
they
were
walking
along
the
terrace
towards
a
figure
which
was
coming
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
seen
it
by
itself
,
under
such
conditions
of
gas
-
lamp
,
mist
,
and
distance
,
he
might
not
have
known
it
at
first
sight
,
but
with
the
figure
of
the
girl
to
prompt
him
,
he
at
once
recognised
Miss
Wade
.
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
at
the
corner
,
seeming
to
look
back
expectantly
up
the
street
as
if
he
had
made
an
appointment
with
some
one
to
meet
him
there
;
but
he
kept
a
careful
eye
on
the
three
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
together
,
the
man
took
off
his
hat
,
and
made
Miss
Wade
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
appeared
to
say
a
few
words
as
though
she
presented
him
,
or
accounted
for
his
being
late
,
or
early
,
or
what
not
;
and
then
fell
a
pace
or
so
behind
,
by
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
and
the
man
then
began
to
walk
up
and
down
;
the
man
having
the
appearance
of
being
extremely
courteous
and
complimentary
in
manner
;
Miss
Wade
having
the
appearance
of
being
extremely
haughty
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
came
down
to
the
corner
and
turned
,
she
was
saying
,
   
"
If
I
pinch
myself
for
it
,
sir
,
that
is
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
Confine
yourself
to
yours
,
and
ask
me
no
question
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
Heaven
,
ma'am
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
making
her
another
bow
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
profound
respect
for
the
strength
of
your
character
,
and
my
admiration
of
your
beauty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
from
any
one
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
certainly
not
from
you
of
all
creatures
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
with
your
report
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
pardoned
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
with
an
air
of
half
abashed
gallantry
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
paid
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
that
is
all
you
want
.
"
   
<EOS>
Whether
the
girl
hung
behind
because
she
was
not
to
hear
the
business
,
or
as
already
knowing
enough
about
it
,
Clennam
could
not
determine
.
 
<EOS>
They
turned
and
she
turned
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
away
at
the
river
,
as
she
walked
with
her
hands
folded
before
her
;
and
that
was
all
he
could
make
of
her
without
showing
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
There
happened
,
by
good
fortune
,
to
be
a
lounger
really
waiting
for
some
one
;
and
he
sometimes
looked
over
the
railing
at
the
water
,
and
sometimes
came
to
the
dark
corner
and
looked
up
the
street
,
rendering
Arthur
less
conspicuous
.
   
<EOS>
When
Miss
Wade
and
the
man
came
back
again
,
she
was
saying
,
"
You
must
wait
until
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
pardons
?
<EOS>
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
faith
!
 
<EOS>
Then
it
's
not
convenient
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
must
get
it
before
I
can
give
it
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
stopped
in
the
roadway
,
as
if
to
put
an
end
to
the
conference
.
<EOS>
He
of
course
stopped
too
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
girl
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
little
inconvenient
,
"
said
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
little
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Holy
Blue
!
 
<EOS>
that
's
nothing
in
such
a
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
without
money
to
-
night
,
by
chance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
banker
in
this
city
,
but
I
would
not
wish
to
draw
upon
the
house
until
the
time

Harriet
,
"
said
Miss
Wade
,
"
arrange
with
him
---
this
gentleman
here
---
for
sending
him
some
money
to
-
morrow
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
said
it
with
a
slur
of
the
word
gentleman
which
was
more
contemptuous
than
any
emphasis
,
and
walked
slowly
on
.
<EOS>
The
man
bent
his
head
again
,
and
the
girl
spoke
to
him
as
they
both
followed
her
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
ventured
to
look
at
the
girl
as
they
Moved
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
note
that
her
rich
black
eyes
were
fastened
upon
the
man
with
a
scrutinising
expression
,
and
that
she
kept
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
as
they
walked
side
by
side
to
the
further
end
of
the
terrace
.
   
<EOS>
A
loud
and
altered
clank
upon
the
pavement
warned
him
,
before
he
could
discern
what
was
passing
there
,
that
the
man
was
coming
back
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
lounged
into
the
road
,
towards
the
railing
;
and
the
man
passed
at
a
quick
swing
,
with
the
end
of
his
cloak
thrown
over
his
shoulder
,
singing
a
scrap
of
a
French
song
.
   
<EOS>
The
whole
vista
had
no
one
in
it
now
but
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
lounger
had
lounged
out
of
view
,
and
Miss
Wade
and
Tattycoram
were
gone
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
ever
bent
on
seeing
what
became
of
them
,
and
on
having
some
information
to
give
his
good
friend
,
Mr
Meagles
,
he
went
out
at
the
further
end
of
the
terrace
,
looking
cautiously
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
rightly
judged
that
,
at
first
at
all
events
,
they
would
go
in
a
contrary
direction
from
their
late
companion
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
saw
them
in
a
neighbouring
bye
-
street
,
which
was
not
a
thoroughfare
,
evidently
allowing
time
for
the
man
to
get
well
out
of
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
They
walked
leisurely
arm
-
in
-
arm
down
one
side
of
the
street
,
and
returned
on
the
opposite
side
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
back
to
the
street
-
corner
,
they
changed
their
pace
for
the
pace
of
people
with
an
object
and
a
distance
before
them
,
and
walked
steadily
away
.
<EOS>
Clennam
,
no
less
steadily
,
kept
them
in
sight
.
   
<EOS>
They
crossed
the
Strand
,
and
passed
through
Covent
Garden
(
under
the
windows
of
his
old
lodging
where
dear
Little
Dorrit
had
come
that
night
)
,
and
slanted
away
north
-
east
,
until
they
passed
the
great
building
whence
Tattycoram
derived
her
name
,
and
turned
into
the
Gray
's
Inn
Road
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
was
quite
at
home
here
,
in
right
of
Flora
,
not
to
mention
the
Patriarch
and
Pancks
,
and
kept
them
in
view
with
ease
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
beginning
to
wonder
where
they
might
be
going
next
,
when
that
wonder
was
lost
in
the
greater
wonder
with
which
he
saw
them
turn
into
the
Patriarchal
street
.
 
<EOS>
That
wonder
was
in
its
turn
swallowed
up
on
the
greater
wonder
with
which
he
saw
them
stop
at
the
Patriarchal
door
.
 
<EOS>
A
low
double
knock
at
the
bright
brass
knocker
,
a
gleam
of
light
into
the
road
from
the
opened
door
,
a
brief
pause
for
inquiry
and
answer
and
the
door
was
shut
,
and
they
were
housed
.
   
<EOS>
After
looking
at
the
surrounding
objects
for
assurance
that
he
was
not
in
an
odd
dream
,
and
after
pacing
a
little
while
before
the
house
,
Arthur
knocked
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
opened
by
the
usual
maid
-
servant
,
and
she
showed
him
up
at
once
,
with
her
usual
alacrity
,
to
Flora
's
sitting
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
one
with
Flora
but
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
which
respectable
gentlewoman
,
basking
in
a
balmy
atmosphere
of
tea
and
toast
,
was
ensconced
in
an
easy
-
chair
by
the
fireside
,
with
a
little
table
at
her
elbow
,
and
a
clean
white
handkerchief
spread
over
her
lap
on
which
two
pieces
of
toast
at
that
moment
awaited
consumption
.
<EOS>
Bending
over
a
steaming
vessel
of
tea
,
and
looking
through
the
steam
,
and
breathing
forth
the
steam
,
like
a
malignant
Chinese
enchantress
engaged
in
the
performance
of
unholy
rites
,
Mr
F
's
Aunt
put
down
her
great
teacup
and
exclaimed
,
"
Drat
him
,
if
he
an't
come
back
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
seem
from
the
foregoing
exclamation
that
this
uncompromising
relative
of
the
lamented
Mr
F
,
measuring
time
by
the
acuteness
of
her
sensations
and
not
by
the
clock
,
supposed
Clennam
to
have
lately
gone
away
;
whereas
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
year
had
elapsed
since
he
had
had
the
temerity
to
present
himself
before
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
goodness
Arthur
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Flora
,
rising
to
give
him
a
cordial
reception
,
"
Doyce
and
Clennam
<EOS>
what
a
start
and
a
surprise
for
though
not
far
from
the
machinery
and
foundry
business
and
surely
might
be
taken
sometimes
if
at
no
other
time
about
mid
-
day
when
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
humble
sandwich
of
whatever
cold
meat
in
the
larder
might
not
come
amiss
nor
taste
the
worse
for
being
friendly
for
<EOS>
you
know
you
buy
it
somewhere
and
wherever
bought
a
profit
must
be
made
or
they
would
never
keep
the
place
it
stands
to
reason
without
a
motive
still
never
seen
and
learnt
now
not
to
be
expected
,
for
as
Mr
F
himself
said
if
seeing
is
believing
not
seeing
is
believing
too
and
when
you
do
n't
see
you
may
fully
believe
you
're
not
remembered
<EOS>
not
that
I
expect
you
Arthur
Doyce
and
Clennam
to
remember
me
why
should
I
for
the
days
are
gone
but
bring
another
teacup
here
directly
and
tell
her
fresh
toast
and
pray
sit
near
the
fire
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
was
in
the
greatest
anxiety
to
explain
the
object
of
his
visit
;
but
was
put
off
for
the
moment
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
by
what
he
understood
of
the
reproachful
purport
of
these
words
,
and
by
the
genuine
pleasure
she
testified
in
seeing
him
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
pray
tell
me
something
all
you
know
,
"
said
Flora
,
drawing
her
chair
near
to
his
,
"
about
the
good
dear
quiet
little
thing
and
all
the
changes
of
her
fortunes
carriage
people
now
<EOS>
no
doubt
and
horses
without
number
most
romantic
,
a
coat
of
arms
of
course
and
wild
beasts
on
their
hind
legs
showing
it
as
if
it
was
a
copy
they
had
done
with
mouths
from
ear
to
ear
good
gracious
,
and
has
she
her
health
which
is
the
first
consideration
after
all
for
what
is
wealth
without
it
<EOS>
Mr
F
himself
so
often
saying
when
his
twinges
came
that
sixpence
a
day
and
find
yourself
and
no
gout
so
much
preferable
,
not
that
he
could
have
lived
on
anything
like
it
being
the
last
man
or
that
the
previous
little
thing
though
far
too
familiar
an
expression
now
had
any
tendency
of
that
sort
much
too
slight
and
small
but
looked
<EOS>
so
fragile
bless
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
who
had
eaten
a
piece
of
toast
down
to
the
crust
,
here
solemnly
handed
the
crust
to
Flora
,
who
ate
it
for
her
as
a
matter
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
then
moistened
her
ten
fingers
in
slow
succession
at
her
lips
,
and
wiped
them
in
exactly
the
same
order
on
the
white
handkerchief
;
then
took
the
other
piece
of
toast
,
and
fell
to
work
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
While
pursuing
this
routine
,
she
looked
at
Clennam
with
an
expression
of
such
intense
severity
that
he
felt
obliged
to
look
at
her
in
return
,
against
his
personal
inclinations
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
Italy
,
with
all
her
family
,
Flora
,
"
he
said
,
when
the
dreaded
lady
was
occupied
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
Italy
is
she
really
?
"
said
Flora
,
"
with
the
grapes
growing
everywhere
and
lava
necklaces
and
bracelets
too
that
land
of
poetry
with
burning
mountains
picturesque
beyond
belief
though
if
the
organ
-
boys
come
away
from
the
neighbourhood
not
to
be
scorched
nobody
can
wonder
being
so
young
and
bringing
their
white
mice
with
them
most
humane
,
and
is
she
really
in
that
favoured
land
with
nothing
but
blue
about
her
and
dying
gladiators
and
Belvederes
though
Mr
F
himself
did
not
believe
for
his
objection
when
in
spirits
was
that
the
images
could
not
be
true
there
being
no
medium
between
expensive
quantities
of
linen
badly
got
up
and
all
in
creases
and
<EOS>
none
whatever
,
which
certainly
does
not
seem
probable
though
perhaps
in
consequence
of
the
extremes
of
rich
and
poor
which
may
account
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
tried
to
edge
a
word
in
,
but
Flora
hurried
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Venice
Preserved
too
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
think
you
have
been
there
is
it
well
or
ill
preserved
for
people
differ
so
and
Maccaroni
if
they
really
eat
it
like
the
conjurors
why
not
cut
it
shorter
,
you
are
acquainted
Arthur

dear
Doyce

Clennam
at
least
not
dear
and
most
assuredly
not
Doyce
for
I
have
not
the
pleasure

pray
excuse
me
---
acquainted

I
believe
with
Mantua
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
Mantua
-
making
for
I
never
have
been
able
to
conceive
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
there
is
no
connection
,
Flora
,
between
the
two
,
"
Arthur
was
beginning
,
when
she
caught
him
up
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
your
word
no
is
n't
there
<EOS>
I
never
did
<EOS>
but
that
's
like
me
<EOS>
I
run
away
with
an
idea
and
having
none
to
spare
<EOS>
I
keep
it
,
<EOS>
alas
there
was
a
time
dear
Arthur
that
is
to
say
decidedly
not
dear
nor
Arthur
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
but
you
understand
me
when
one
bright
idea
gilded
the
what's
-
his
-
name
horizon
of
et
cetera
<EOS>
but
it
is
darkly
clouded
now
and
all
is
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
's
increasing
wish
to
speak
of
something
very
different
was
by
this
time
so
plainly
written
on
his
face
,
that
Flora
stopped
in
a
tender
look
,
and
asked
him
what
it
was
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
greatest
desire
,
Flora
,
to
speak
to
some
one
who
is
now
in
this
house
---
with
Mr
Casby
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Some
one
whom
I
saw
come
in
,
and
who
,
in
a
misguided
and
deplorable
way
,
has
deserted
the
house
of
a
friend
of
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Papa
sees
so
many
and
such
odd
people
,
"
said
Flora
,
rising
,
"
that
I
should
n't
venture
to
go
down
for
any
one
<EOS>
but
you
Arthur
<EOS>
but
for
you
I
would
willingly
go
down
in
a
diving
-
bell
much
more
a
dining
-
room
and
will
come
back
directly
if
you
'll
mind
and
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
not
mind
Mr
F
's
Aunt
while
I
'm
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
and
a
parting
glance
,
Flora
bustled
out
,
leaving
Clennam
under
dreadful
apprehension
of
this
terrible
charge
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
variation
which
manifested
itself
in
Mr
F
's
Aunt
's
demeanour
when
she
had
finished
her
piece
of
toast
,
was
a
loud
and
prolonged
sniff
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
it
impossible
to
avoid
construing
this
demonstration
into
a
defiance
of
himself
,
its
gloomy
significance
being
unmistakable
,
Clennam
looked
plaintively
at
the
excellent
though
prejudiced
lady
from
whom
it
emanated
,
in
the
hope
that
she
might
be
disarmed
by
a
meek
submission
.
   
<EOS>
"
None
of
your
eyes
at
me
,
"
said
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
shivering
with
hostility
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
"
was
the
crust
of
the
piece
of
toast
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
accepted
the
boon
with
a
look
of
gratitude
,
and
held
it
in
his
hand
under
the
pressure
of
a
little
embarrassment
,
which
was
not
relieved
when
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
elevating
her
voice
into
a
cry
of
considerable
power
,
exclaimed
,
"
He
has
a
proud
stomach
,
this
chap
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
too
proud
a
chap
to
eat
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
coming
out
of
her
chair
,
shook
her
venerable
fist
so
very
close
to
his
nose
as
to
tickle
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
the
timely
return
of
Flora
,
to
find
him
in
this
difficult
situation
,
further
consequences
might
have
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
,
without
the
least
discomposure
or
surprise
,
but
congratulating
the
old
lady
in
an
approving
manner
on
being
"
very
lively
to
-
night
'
,
handed
her
back
to
her
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
a
proud
stomach
,
this
chap
,
"
said
Mr
F
's
relation
,
on
being
reseated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
him
a
meal
of
chaff
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
would
like
that
,
aunt
,
"
returned
Flora
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
him
a
meal
of
chaff
,
I
tell
you
,
"
said
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
glaring
round
Flora
on
her
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
only
thing
for
a
proud
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
eat
up
every
morsel
.
 
<EOS>
Drat
him
,
give
him
a
meal
of
chaff
!
"
   
<EOS>
Under
a
general
pretence
of
helping
him
to
this
refreshment
,
Flora
got
him
out
on
the
staircase
;
Mr
F
's
Aunt
even
then
constantly
reiterating
,
with
inexpressible
bitterness
,
that
he
was
"
a
chap
,
"
and
had
a
"
proud
stomach
,
"
and
over
and
over
again
insisting
on
that
equine
provision
being
made
for
him
which
she
had
already
so
strongly
prescribed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
an
inconvenient
staircase
and
so
many
corner
-
stairs
Arthur
,
"
whispered
Flora
,
"
would
you
object
to
putting
your
arm
round
me
under
my
pelerine
?
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
sense
of
going
down
-
stairs
in
a
highly
-
ridiculous
manner
,
Clennam
descended
in
the
required
attitude
,
and
only
released
his
fair
burden
at
the
dining
-
room
door
;
indeed
,
even
there
she
was
rather
difficult
to
be
got
rid
of
,
remaining
in
his
embrace
to
murmur
,
"
Arthur
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
do
n't
breathe
it
to
papa
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
accompanied
Arthur
into
the
room
,
where
the
Patriarch
sat
alone
,
with
his
list
shoes
on
the
fender
,
twirling
his
thumbs
as
if
he
had

The
youthful
Patriarch
,
aged
ten
,
looked
out
of
his
picture
-
frame
above
him
with
no
calmer
air
than
he
.
<EOS>
Both
smooth
heads
were
alike
beaming
,
blundering
,
and
bumpy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
well
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
hope
you
are
well
.
 
<EOS>
Please
to
sit
down
,
please
to
sit
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
,
sir
,
"
said
Clennam
,
doing
so
,
and
looking
round
with
a
face
of
blank
disappointment
,
"
not
to
find
you
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
indeed
?
"
said
the
Patriarch
,
sweetly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
indeed
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
<EOS>
so
you
know
papa
,
"
cried
Flora
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
Patriarch
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
just
so
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
to
be
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
demanded
Clennam
,
anxiously
,
"
is
Miss
Wade
gone
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
---
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
call
her
Wade
,
"
returned
Mr
Casby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Highly
proper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Arthur
quickly
returned
,
"
What
do
you
call
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wade
,
"
said
Mr
Casby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
always
Wade
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
looking
at
the
philanthropic
visage
and
the
long
silky
white
hair
for
a
few
seconds
,
during
which
Mr
Casby
twirled
his
thumbs
,
and
smiled
at
the
fire
as
if
he
were
benevolently
wishing
it
to
burn
him
that
he
might
forgive
it
,
Arthur
began
:
   
"
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Casby
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Not
so
,
not
so
,
"
said
the
Patriarch
,
"
not
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
,
Miss
Wade
had
an
attendant
with
her
---
a
young
woman
brought
up
by
friends
of
mine
,
over
whom
her
influence
is
not
considered
very
salutary
,
and
to
whom
I
should
be
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
giving
the
assurance
that
she
has
not
yet
forfeited
the
interest
of
those
protectors
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
really
?
"
returned
the
Patriarch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
therefore
be
so
good
as
to
give
me
the
address
of
Miss
Wade
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
,
dear
!
"
said
the
Patriarch
,
"
how
very
unfortunate
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
only
sent
in
to
me
when
they
were
here
!
 
<EOS>
I
observed
the
young
woman
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
A
fine
full
-
coloured
young
woman
,
Mr
Clennam
,
with
very
dark
hair
and
very
dark
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
mistake
not
,
if
I
mistake
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
assented
,
and
said
once
more
with
new
expression
,
"
If
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
give
me
the
address
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
,
dear
!
"
exclaimed
the
Patriarch
in
sweet
regret
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
pity
,
what
a
pity
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
address
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
mostly
lives
abroad
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
done
so
for
some
years
,
and
she
is
(
if
I
may
say
so
of
a
fellow
-
creature
and
a
lady
)
fitful
and
uncertain
to
a
fault
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
see
her
again
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
never
see
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
pity
,
<EOS>
what
a
pity
!
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
saw
now
,
that
he
had
as
much
hope
of
getting
assistance
out
of
the
Portrait
as
out
of
the
Patriarch
;
but
he
said
nevertheless
:
   
"
Mr
Casby
,
could
you
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
friends
I
have
mentioned
,
and
under
any
obligation
of
secrecy
that
you
may
consider
it
your
duty
to
impose
,
give
me
any
information
at
all
touching
Miss
Wade
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
abroad
,
and
I
have
seen
her
at
home
,
but
I
know
nothing
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Could
you
give
me
any
account
of
her
whatever
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
,
"
returned
the
Patriarch
,
shaking
his
big
head
with
his
utmost
benevolence
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
<EOS>
dear
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
real
pity
that
she
stayed
so
short
a
time
,
and
you
delayed
!
 
<EOS>
As
confidential
agency
business
,
agency
business
,
I
have
occasionally
paid
this
lady
money
;
but
what
satisfaction
is
it
to
you
,
sir
,
to
know
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
none
at
all
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
"
assented
the
Patriarch
,
with
a
shining
face
as
he
philanthropically
smiled
at
the
fire
,
"
none
at
all
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
hit
the
wise
answer
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
Truly
,
none
at
all
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
turning
of
his
smooth
thumbs
over
one
another
as
he
sat
there
,
was
so
typical
to
Clennam
of
the
way
in
which
he
would
make
the
subject
revolve
if
it
were
pursued
,
never
showing
any
new
part
of
it
nor
allowing
it
to
make
the
smallest
advance
,
that
it
did
much
to
help
to
convince
him
of
his
labour
having
been
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
taken
any
time
to
think
about
it
,
for
Mr
Casby
,
well
accustomed
to
get
on
anywhere
by
leaving
everything
to
his
bumps
and
his
white
hair
,
knew
his
strength
to
lie
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
Casby
sat
,
twirling
and
twirling
,
and
making
his
polished
head
and
forehead
look
largely
benevolent
in
every
knob
.
   
<EOS>
With
this
spectacle
before
him
,
Arthur
had
risen
to
go
,
when
from
the
inner
Dock
where
the
good
ship
Pancks
was
hove
down
when
out
in
no
cruising
ground
,
the
noise
was
heard
of
that
steamer
labouring
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
struck
Arthur
that
the
noise
began
demonstratively
far
off
,
as
though
Mr
Pancks
sought
to
impress
on
any
one
who
might
happen
to
think
about
it
,
that
he
was
working
on
from
out
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
and
he
shook
hands
,
and
the
former
brought
his
employer
a
letter
or
two
to
sign
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
in
shaking
hands
merely
scratched
his
eyebrow
with
his
left
forefinger
and
snorted
once
,
but
Clennam
,
who
understood
him
better
now
than
of
old
,
comprehended
that
he
had
almost
done
for
the
evening
and
wished
to
say
a
word
to
him
outside
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
when
he
had
taken
his
leave
of
Mr
Casby
,
and
(
which
was
a
more
difficult
process
)
of
Flora
,
he
sauntered
in
the
neighbourhood
on
Mr
Pancks
's
line
of
road
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
waited
but
<EOS>
a
short
time
when
Mr
Pancks
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
shaking
hands
again
with
another
expressive
snort
,
and
taking
off
his
hat
to
put
his
hair
up
,
Arthur
thought
he
received
his
cue
to
speak
to
him
as
one
who
knew
pretty
well
what
had
just
now
passed
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
said
,
without
any
preface
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
were
really
gone
,
Pancks
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
really
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
he
know
where
to
find
that
lady
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
did
not
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
Mr
Pancks
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
Did
Mr
Pancks
know
anything
about
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
expect
,
"
rejoined
that
worthy
,
"
I
know
as
much
about
her
as
she
knows
about
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
somebody
's
child
---
<EOS>
anybody
's
---
nobody
's
.
   
<EOS>
Put
her
in
a
room
in
London
here
with
any
six
people
old
enough
to
be
her
parents
,
and
her
parents
may
be
there
for
anything
she
knows
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
in
any
house
she
sees
,
they
may
be
in
any
churchyard
she
passes
,
she
may
run
against
'em
in
any
street
,
she
may
make
chance
acquaintance
of
'em
at
any
time
;
and
never
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
She
knows
nothing
about
'em
.
 
<EOS>
She
knows
nothing
about
any
relative
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
Never
did
.
 
<EOS>
Never
will
.
"
<EOS>
"
Mr
Casby
could
enlighten
her
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
be
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
expect
so
,
but
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
long
had
money
(
not
overmuch
as
I
make
out
)
in
trust
to
dole
out
to
her
when
she
ca
n't
do
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
's
proud
and
wo
n't
touch
it
for
a
length
of
time
;
sometimes
she
's
so
poor
that
she
must
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
writhes
under
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
A
woman
more
angry
,
passionate
,
reckless
,
and
revengeful
never
lived
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
for
money
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Said
she
had
peculiar
occasion
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
observed
Clennam
musing
,
"
<EOS>
I
by
chance
know
what
occasion
---
I
mean
into
whose
pocket
the
money
is
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
a
compact
,
I
recommend
that
party
to
be
exact
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
trust
myself
to
that
woman
,
young
and
handsome
as
she
is
,
if
I
had
wronged
her
;
no
,
not
for
twice
my
proprietor
's
money
!
 
<EOS>
Unless
,
"
Pancks
added
as
a
saving
clause
,
"
I
had
a
lingering
illness
on
me
,
and
wanted
to
get
it
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
,
hurriedly
reviewing
his
own
observation
of
her
,
found
it
to
tally
pretty
nearly
with
Mr
Pancks
's
view
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
wonder
is
to
me
,
"
pursued
Pancks
,
"
that
she
has
never
done
for
my
proprietor
,
as
the
only
person
connected
with
her
story
she
can
lay
hold
of
.
 
<EOS>
Mentioning
<EOS>
that
,
I
may
tell
you
,
between
ourselves
,
that
I
am
sometimes
tempted
to
do
for
him
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
started
and
said
,
"
Dear
me
,
Pancks
,
do
n't
say
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Understand
me
,
"
said
Pancks
,
extending
five
cropped
coaly
finger
-
nails
on
Arthur
's
arm
;
"
I
do
n't
mean
,
cut
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
But
by
all
that
's
precious
,
if
he
goes
too
far
,
I
'll
cut
his
hair
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
exhibited
himself
in
the
new
light
of
enunciating
this
tremendous
threat
,
Mr
Pancks
,
with
a
countenance
of
grave
import
,
snorted
several
times
and
steamed
away
.

Chapter

<EOS>
The
Dreams
of
Mrs
Flintwinch
thicken
 
The
shady
waiting
-
rooms
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
where
he
passed
a
good
deal
of
time
in
company
with
various
troublesome
Convicts
who
were
under
sentence
to
be
broken
alive
on
that
wheel
,
had
afforded
Arthur
Clennam
ample
leisure
,
in
three
or
four
successive
days
,
to
exhaust
the
subject
of
his
late
glimpse
of
Miss
Wade
and
Tattycoram
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
able
to
make
no
more
of
it
and
no
less
of
it
,
and
in
this
unsatisfactory
condition
he
was
fain
to
leave
it
.
   
<EOS>
During
this
space
he
had
not
been
to
his
mother
's
dismal
old
house
.
   
<EOS>
One
of
his
customary
evenings
for
repairing
thither
now
coming
round
<EOS>
,
he
left
his
dwelling
and
his
partner
at
nearly
nine
o'clock
,
and
slowly
walked
in
the
direction
of
that
grim
home
of
his
youth
.
   
<EOS>
It
always
affected
his
imagination
as
wrathful
,
mysterious
,
and
sad
;
and
his
imagination
was
sufficiently
impressible
to
see
the
whole
neighbourhood
under
some
tinge
of
its
dark
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
went
along
,
upon
a
dreary
night
,
the
dim
streets
by
which
he
went
,
seemed
all
depositories
of
oppressive
secrets
.
 
<EOS>
The
deserted
counting
-
houses
,
with
their
secrets
of
books
and
papers
locked
up
in
chests
and
safes
;
the
banking
-
houses
,
with
their
secrets
of
strong
rooms
and
wells
,
the
keys
of
which
were
in
a
very
few
secret
pockets
and
a
very
few
secret
breasts
;
the
secrets
of
all
the
dispersed
grinders
in
the
vast
mill
,
among
whom
there
were
doubtless
plunderers
,
forgers
,
and
trust
-
betrayers
of
many
sorts
,
whom
the
light
of
any
day
that
dawned
might
reveal
;
he
could
have
fancied
that
these
things
,
in
hiding
,
imparted
a
heaviness
to
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
shadow
thickening
and
thickening
as
he
approached
its
source
<EOS>
,
he
thought
of
the
secrets
of
the
lonely
church
-
vaults
,
where
the
people
who
had
hoarded
and
secreted
in
iron
coffers
were
in
their
turn
similarly
hoarded
,
not
yet
at
rest
from
doing
harm
;
and
then
of
the
secrets
of
the
river
,
as
it
rolled
its
turbid
tide
between
two
frowning
wildernesses
of
secrets
,
extending
,
thick
and
dense
,
for
many
miles
,
and
warding
off
the
free
air
and
the
free
country
swept
by
winds
and
wings
of
birds
.
   
<EOS>
The
shadow
still
darkening
as
he
drew
near
the
house
,
the
melancholy
room
which
his
father
had
once
occupied
,
haunted
by
the
appealing
face
<EOS>
he
had
himself
seen
fade
away
with
him
when
there
was
no
other
watcher
by
the
bed
,
arose
before
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Its
close
air
was
secret
.
 
<EOS>
The
gloom
,
and
must
,
and
dust
of
the
whole
tenement
,
were
secret
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
heart
of
it
his
mother
presided
,
inflexible
of
face
,
indomitable
of
will
,
firmly
holding
all
the
secrets
of
her
own
and
his
father
's
life
,
and
austerely
opposing
herself
,
front
to
front
,
to
the
great
final
secret
of
all
life
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
turned
into
the
narrow
and
steep
street
from
which
the
court
of
enclosure
wherein
the
house
stood
opened
,
when
another
footstep
turned
into
it
behind
him
,
and
so
close
upon
his
own
that
he
was
jostled
to
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
As
his
mind
was
teeming
with
these
thoughts
,
the
encounter
took
him
altogether
unprepared
,
so
that
the
other
passenger
had
had
time
to
say
,
boisterously
,
"
Pardon
!
 
<EOS>
Not
my
fault
!
"
<EOS>
and
to
pass
on
before
the
instant
had
elapsed
which
was
requisite
to
his
recovery
of
the
realities
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
When
that
moment
had
flashed
away
,
he
saw
that
the
man
striding
on
before
him
was
the
man
who
had
been
so
much
in
his
mind
during
the
last
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
casual
resemblance
,
helped
out
by
the
force
of
the
impression
the
man
made
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
man
;
the
man
he
had
followed
in
company
with
the
girl
,
and
whom
he
had
overheard
talking
to
Miss
Wade
.
   
<EOS>
The
street
was
a
sharp
descent
and
was
crooked
too
,
and
the
man
(
who
although
not
drunk
had
the
air
of
being
flushed
with
some
strong
drink
)
went
down
it
so
fast
that
Clennam
lost
him
as
he
looked
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
With
no
defined
intention
of
following
him
,
but
with
an
impulse
to
keep
the
figure
in
view
a
little
longer
,
Clennam
quickened
his
pace
to
pass
the
twist
in
the
street
which
hid
him
from
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
On
turning
it
,
he
saw
the
man
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
Standing
now
,
close
to
the
gateway
of
his
mother
's
house
,
he
looked
down
the
street
:
but
it
was
empty
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
projecting
shadow
large
enough
to
obscure
the
man
;
there
was
no
turning
near
that
he
could
have
taken
;
nor
had
there
been
any
audible
sound
of
the
opening
and
closing
of
a
door
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
concluded
that
the
man
must
have
had
a
key
in
his
hand
,
and
must
have
opened
one
of
the
many
house
-
doors
and
gone
in
.
   
<EOS>
Ruminating
on
this
strange
chance
and
strange
glimpse
,
he
turned
into
the
court
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
looked
,
by
mere
habit
,
towards
the
feebly
lighted
windows
of
his
mother
's
room
,
his
eyes
encountered
the
figure
he
had
just
lost
,
standing
against
the
iron
railings
of
the
little
waste
enclosure
looking
up
at
those
windows
and
laughing
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
many
vagrant
cats
who
were
always
prowling
about
there
by
night
,
and
who
had
taken
fright
at
him
,
appeared
to
have
stopped
when
he
had
stopped
,
and
were
looking
at
him
with
eyes
by
no
means
unlike
his
own
from
tops
of
walls
and
porches
,
and
other
safe
points
of
pause
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
only
halted
for
a
moment
to
entertain
himself
thus
;
he
immediately
went
forward
,
throwing
the
end
of
his
cloak
off
his
shoulder
as
he
went
,
ascended
the
unevenly
sunken
steps
,
and
knocked
a
sounding
knock
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
's
surprise
was
not
so
absorbing
but
that
he
took
his
resolution
without
any
incertitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
up
to
the
door
too
,
and
ascended
the
steps
too
.
 
<EOS>
His
friend
looked
at
him
with
a
braggart
air
,
and
sang
to
himself
.
        
<EOS>
"
Who
passes
by
this
road
so
late
?
          
Compagnon
de
la
Majolaine
;
     
<EOS>
Who
passes
by
this
road
so
late
?
          
<EOS>
Always
gay
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
which
he
knocked
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
impatient
,
sir
,
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Death
of
my
life
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
stranger
,
"
it
's
my
character
to
be
impatient
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sound
of
Mistress
Affery
cautiously
chaining
the
door
before
she
opened
it
,
caused
them
both
to
look
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
Affery
opened
it
a
very
little
,
with
a
flaring
candle
in
her
hands
and
asked
who
was
that
,
at
that
time
of
night
,
with
that
knock
!
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Arthur
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
added
with
astonishment
,
seeing
him
first
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
you
sure
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
Lord
save
us
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
"
she
cried
out
,
seeing
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Him
again
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
true
!
 
<EOS>
Him
again
,
dear
Mrs
Flintwinch
,
"
cried
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
and
let
me
take
my
dear
friend
Jeremiah
to
my
arms
!
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
and
let
me
hasten
myself
to
embrace
my
Flintwinch
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
at
home
,
"
cried
Affery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fetch
him
!
"
cried
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fetch
my
Flintwinch
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
it
is
his
old
Blandois
,
who
comes
from
arriving
in
England
;
tell
him
that
it
is
his
little
boy
who
is
here
,
his
cabbage
,
his
well
-
beloved
!
 
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
beautiful
Mrs
Flintwinch
,
and
in
the
meantime
let
me
to
pass
up
-
stairs
,
to
present
my
compliments
---
homage
of
Blandois
---
to
my
lady
!
 
<EOS>
My
lady
lives
always
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
well
.
   
<EOS>
Open
then
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
Arthur
's
increased
surprise
,
Mistress
Affery
,
stretching
her
eyes
wide
at
himself
,
as
if
in
warning
that
this
was
not
a
gentleman
for
him
to
interfere
with
,
drew
back
the
chain
,
and
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
without
ceremony
,
walked
into
the
hall
,
leaving
Arthur
to
follow
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Despatch
then
!
 
<EOS>
Achieve
then
!
 
<EOS>
Bring
my
Flintwinch
!
 
<EOS>
Announce
me
to
my
lady
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
stranger
,
clanking
about
the
stone
floor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
tell
me
,
Affery
,
"
said
Arthur
aloud
and
sternly
,
as
he
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
with
indignation
;
"
who
is
this
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
tell
me
,
Affery
,
"
the
stranger
repeated
in
his
turn
,
"
who
---
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
---
who
is
this
gentleman
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
voice
of
Mrs
Clennam
opportunely
called
from
her
chamber
above
,
"
Affery
,
let
them
both
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
,
come
straight
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Arthur
?
"
exclaimed
Blandois
,
taking
off
his
hat
at
arm
's
length
,
and
bringing
his
heels
together
from
a
great
stride
in
making
him
a
flourishing
bow
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
son
of
my
lady
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
all
-
devoted
of
the
son
of
my
lady
!
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
looked
at
him
again
in
no
more
flattering
manner
than
before
,
and
,
turning
on
his
heel
without
acknowledgment
,
went
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
visitor
followed
him
up
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
took
the
key
from
behind
the
door
,
and
deftly
slipped
out
to
fetch
her
lord
.
   
<EOS>
A
bystander
,
informed
of
the
previous
appearance
of
Monsieur
Blandois
in
that
room
,
would
have
observed
a
difference
in
Mrs
Clennam
's
present
reception
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
not
one
to
betray
it
;
and
her
suppressed
manner
,
and
her
set
voice
,
were
equally
under
her
control
.
 
<EOS>
It
wholly
consisted
in
her
never
taking
her
eyes
off
his
face
from
the
moment
of
his
entrance
,
and
in
her
twice
or
thrice
,
when
he
was
becoming
noisy
,
swaying
herself
a
very
little
forward
in
the
chair
in
which
she
sat
upright
,
with
her
hands
immovable
upon
its
elbows
;
as
if
she
gave
him
the
assurance
that
he
should
be
presently
heard
at
any
length
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
did
not
fail
to
observe
this
;
though
the
difference
between
the
present
occasion
and
the
former
was
not
within
his
power
of
observation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madame
,
"
said
Blandois
,
"
do
me
the
honour
to
present
me
to
Monsieur
,
your
son
.
 
<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
,
madame
,
that
Monsieur
,
your
son
,
is
disposed
to
complain
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
polite
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Arthur
,
striking
in
expeditiously
,
"
whoever
you
are
,
and
however
you
come
to
be
here
,
if
I
were
the
master
of
this
house
<EOS>
I
would
lose
no
time
in
placing
you
on
the
outside
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
,
"
said
his
mother
,
without
looking
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Unfortunately
for
the
gratification
of
your
unreasonable
temper
,
you
are
not
the
master
,
Arthur
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
claim
to
be
,
mother
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
object
to
this
person
's
manner
of
conducting
himself
here
,
and
object
to
it
so
much
,
that
if
I
had
any
authority
here
I
certainly
would
not
suffer
him
to
remain
a
minute
,
I
object
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
case
of
objection
being
necessary
,
"
she
returned
,
"
I
could
object
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
And
of
course
I
should
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
subject
of
their
dispute
,
who
had
seated
himself
,
laughed
aloud
,
and
rapped
his
legs
with
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
right
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
always
intent
on
Blandois
,
however
directly
she
addressed
her
son
,
"
to
speak
to
the
prejudice
of
any
gentleman
(
least
of
all
a
gentleman
from
another
country
)
,
because
he
does
not
conform
to
your
standard
,
or
square
his
behaviour
by
your
rules
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
possible
that
the
gentleman
may
,
on
similar
grounds
,
object
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
returned
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Clennam
,
"
on
a
former
occasion
<EOS>
brought
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
us
from
highly
esteemed
and
responsible
correspondents
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
perfectly
unacquainted
with
the
gentleman
's
object
in
coming
here
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
entirely
ignorant
of
it
,
and
can
not
be
supposed
likely
to
be
able
to
form
the
remotest
guess
at
its
nature
;
"
her
habitual
frown
became
stronger
,
as
she
very
slowly
and
weightily
emphasised
those
words
;
"
but
,
when
the
gentleman
proceeds
to
explain
his
object
,
as
I
shall
beg
him
to
have
the
goodness
to
do
to
myself
and
Flintwinch
,
when
Flintwinch
returns
,
it
will
prove
,
no
doubt
,
to
be
one
more
or
less
in
the
usual
way
of
our
business
,
which
it
will
be
both
our
business
and
our
pleasure
to
advance
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
be
nothing
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
madame
!
"
said
the
man
of
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
she
assented
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
is
acquainted
with
Flintwinch
;
and
when
the
gentleman
was
in
London
last
,
I
remember
to
have
heard
that
he
and
Flintwinch
had
some
entertainment
or
good
-
fellowship
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
the
way
of
knowing
much
that
passes
outside
this
room
,
and
the
jingle
of
little
worldly
things
beyond
it
does
not
much
interest
me
;
but
I
remember
to
have
heard
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Right
,
madame
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
laughed
again
,
and
whistled
the
burden
of
the
tune
he
had
sung
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
Arthur
,
"
said
his
mother
,
"
the
gentleman
comes
here
as
an
acquaintance
,
and
no
stranger
;
and
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
your
unreasonable
temper
should
have
found
offence
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
regret
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
so
to
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
say
so
,
I
know
;
therefore
I
say
it
for
myself
and
Flintwinch
,
since
with
us
two
the
gentleman
's
business
lies
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
key
of
the
door
below
was
now
heard
in
the
lock
,
and
the
door
was
heard
to
open
and
close
.
 
<EOS>
In
due
sequence
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
appeared
;
on
whose
entrance
the
visitor
rose
from
his
chair
,
laughing
loud
,
and
folded
him
in
a
close
embrace
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
goes
it
,
my
cherished
friend
!
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
goes
the
world
,
my
Flintwinch
?
 
<EOS>
Rose
-
coloured
?
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
,
so
much
the
better
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
you
look
charming
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
you
look
young
and
fresh
as
the
flowers
of
Spring
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
good
little
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Brave
child
,
brave
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
While
heaping
these
compliments
on
Mr
Flintwinch
,
he
rolled
him
about
with
a
hand
on
each
of
his
shoulders
,
until
the
staggerings
of
that
gentleman
,
who
under
the
circumstances
was
dryer
and
more
twisted
than
ever
,
were
like
those
of
a
teetotum
nearly
spent
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
presentiment
,
last
time
,
that
we
should
be
better
and
more
intimately
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
coming
on
you
,
Flintwinch
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
yet
coming
on
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
unusually
.
 
<EOS>
Had
n't
you
better
be
seated
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
calling
for
some
more
of
that
port
,
sir
,
I
guess
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Little
joker
!
 
<EOS>
Little
pig
!
"
cried
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
ha
ha
ha
!
"
And
throwing
Mr
Flintwinch
away
,
as
a
closing
piece
of
raillery
,
he
sat
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
amazement
,
suspicion
,
resentment
,
and
shame
,
with
which
Arthur
looked
on
at
all
this
,
struck
him
dumb
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
who
had
spun
backward
some
two
or
three
yards
under
the
impetus
last
given
to
him
,
brought
himself
up
with
a
face
completely
unchanged
in
its
stolidity
except
as
it
was
affected
by
shortness
of
breath
,
and
looked
hard
at
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
whit
less
reticent
and
wooden
was
Mr
Flintwinch
outwardly
,
than
in
the
usual
course
of
things
:
<EOS>
the
only
perceptible
difference
in
him
being
that
the
knot
of
cravat
which
was
generally
under
his
ear
,
had
worked
round
to
the
back
of
his
head
:
where
it
formed
an
ornamental
appendage
not
unlike
a
bagwig
,
and
gave
him
something
of
a
courtly
appearance
.
<EOS>
As
Mrs
Clennam
never
removed
her
eyes
from
Blandois
(
on
whom
they
had
some
effect
,
as
a
steady
look
has
on
a
lower
sort
of
dog
)
,
so
Jeremiah
never
removed
his
from
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
they
had
tacitly
agreed
to
take
their
different
provinces
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
in
the
ensuing
silence
,
Jeremiah
stood
scraping
his
chin
and
looking
at
Arthur
as
though
he
were
trying
to
screw
his
thoughts
out
of
him
with
an
instrument
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
little
,
the
visitor
,
as
if
he
felt
the
silence
irksome
,
rose
,
and
impatiently
put
himself
with
his
back
to
the
sacred
fire
which
had
burned
through
so
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
Mrs
Clennam
said
,
moving
one
of
her
hands
for
the
first
time
,
and
moving
it
very
slightly
with
an
action
of
dismissal
:
   
<EOS>
"
Please
to
leave
us
to
our
business
,
Arthur
.
"
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
I
do
so
with
reluctance
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
with
what
,
"
she
returned
,
"
or
with
what
not
.
 
<EOS>
Please
to
leave
us
.
 
<EOS>
Come
back
at
any
other
time
when
you
may
consider
it
a
duty
to
bury
half
an
hour
wearily
here
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
held
up
her
muffled
fingers
that
he
might
touch
them
with
his
,
according
to
their
usual
custom
,
and
he
stood
over
her
wheeled
chair
to
touch
her
face
with
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
,
then
,
that
her
cheek
was
more
strained
than
usual
,
and
that
it
was
colder
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
followed
the
direction
of
her
eyes
,
in
rising
again
,
towards
Mr
Flintwinch
's
good
friend
,
Mr
Blandois
,
Mr
Blandois
snapped
his
finger
and
thumb
with
one
loud
contemptuous
snap
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
leave
your
---
your
business
acquaintance
in
my
mother
's
room
,
Mr
Flintwinch
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
with
a
great
deal
of
surprise
and
a
great
deal
of
unwillingness
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
person
referred
to
snapped
his
finger
and
thumb
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
mother
.
"
   
"
Good
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
friend
once
,
my
good
comrade
Flintwinch
,
"
said
Blandois
,
standing
astride
before
the
fire
,
and
so
evidently
saying
it
to
arrest
Clennam
's
retreating
steps
,
that
he
lingered
near
the
door
;
"
I
had
a
friend
once
,
who
had
heard
so
much
of
the
dark
side
of
this
city
and
its
ways
,
that
he
would
n't
have
confided
himself
alone
by
night
with
two
people
who
had
an
interest
in
getting
him
under
the
ground
---
my
faith
!
 
<EOS>
not
even
in
a
respectable
house
like
this
---
unless
he
was
bodily
too
strong
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Bah
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
poltroon
,
my
Flintwinch
!
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
A
cur
,
sir
.
"
   
"
Agreed
!
 
<EOS>
A
cur
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
would
n't
have
done
it
,
my
Flintwinch
,
unless
he
had
known
them
to
have
the
will
to
silence
him
,
without
the
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
n't
have
drunk
from
a
glass
of
water
under
such
circumstances
---
not
even
in
a
respectable
house
like
this
,
my
Flintwinch
---
unless
he
had
seen
one
of
them
drink
first
,
and
swallow
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
Disdaining
to
speak
,
and
indeed
not
very
well
able
,
for
he
was
half
-
choking
,
Clennam
only
glanced
at
the
visitor
as
he
passed
out
.
   
<EOS>
The
visitor
saluted
him
with
another
parting
snap
,
and
his
nose
came
down
over
his
moustache
and
his
moustache
went
up
under
his
nose
,
in
an
ominous
and
ugly
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
Affery
,
"
whispered
Clennam
,
as
she
opened
the
door
for
him
in
the
dark
hall
,
and
he
groped
his
way
to
the
sight
of
the
night
-
sky
,
"
what
is
going
on
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
Her
own
appearance
was
sufficiently
ghastly
,
standing
in
the
dark
with
her
apron
thrown
over
her
head
,
and
speaking
behind
it
in
a
low
,
deadened
voice
.

"
Do

I
've
been
in
a
dream
for
ever

long

<EOS>
Go
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
went
out
,
and
she
shut
the
door
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
up
at
the
windows
of
his
mother
's
room
,
and
the
dim
light
,
deadened
by
the
yellow
blinds
,
seemed
to
say
a
response
after
Affery
,
and
to
mutter
,
"
Do

A
Letter
from
Little
Dorrit
 
Dear
Mr
Clennam
,
   
<EOS>
As
I
said
in
my
last
that
it
was
best
for
nobody
to
write
to
me
,
and
as
my
sending
you
another
little
letter
can
therefore
give
you
no
other
trouble
than
the
trouble
of
reading
it
(
perhaps
you
may
not
find
leisure
for
even
that
,
though
I
hope
you
will
some
day
)
,
I
am
now
going
to
devote
an
hour
to
writing
to
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
This
time
,
I
write
from
Rome
.
   
<EOS>
We
left
Venice
before
Mr
and
Mrs
Gowan
did
,
but
they
were
not
so
long
upon
the
road
as
we
were
,
and
did
not
travel
by
the
same
way
,
and
so
when
we
arrived
we
found
them
in
a
lodging
here
,
in
a
place
called
the
Via
Gregoriana
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
Now
I
am
going
to
tell
you
all
I
can
about
them
,
because
I
know
that
is
what
you
most
want
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
Theirs
is
not
a
very
comfortable
lodging
,
but
perhaps
I
thought
it
less
so
when
I
first
saw
it
than
you
would
have
done
,
because
you
have
been
in
many
different
countries
and
have
seen
many
different
customs
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
it
is
a
far
,
far
better
place
---
millions
of
times
---
than
any
I
have
ever
been
used
to
until
lately
;
and
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
do
n't
look
at
it
with
my
own
eyes
,
but
with
hers
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
would
be
easy
to
see
that
she
has
always
been
brought
up
in
a
tender
and
happy
home
,
even
if
she
had
not
told
me
so
with
great
love
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
Well
,
it
is
a
rather
bare
lodging
up
a
rather
dark
common
staircase
,
and
it
is
nearly
all
a
large
dull
room
,
where
Mr
Gowan
paints
.
 
<EOS>
The
windows
are
blocked
up
where
any
one
could
look
out
,
and
the
walls
have
been
all
drawn
over
with
chalk
and
charcoal
by
others
who
have
lived
there
before
---
<EOS>
oh
,
---
I
should
think
,
for
years
!
   
<EOS>
There
is
a
curtain
more
dust
-
coloured
than
red
,
which
divides
it
,
and
the
part
behind
the
curtain
makes
the
private
sitting
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
first
saw
her
there
she
was
alone
,
and
her
work
had
fallen
out
of
her
hand
,
and
she
was
looking
up
at
the
sky
shining
through
the
tops
of
the
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
be
uneasy
when
I
tell
you
,
but
it
was
not
quite
so
airy
,
nor
so
bright
,
nor
so
cheerful
,
nor
so
happy
and
youthful
altogether
as
I
should
have
liked
it
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
On
account
of
Mr
Gowan
's
painting
Papa
's
picture
(
which
I
am
not
quite
convinced
I
should
have
known
from
the
likeness
if
I
had
not
seen
him
doing
it
)
,
I
have
had
more
opportunities
of
being
with
her
since
then
than
I
might
have
had
without
this
fortunate
chance
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
much
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Very
much
alone
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
about
the
second
time
I
saw
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
went
one
day
,
when
it
happened
that
I
could
run
round
by
myself
,
at
four
or
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
then
dining
alone
,
and
her
solitary
dinner
had
been
brought
in
from
somewhere
,
over
a
kind
of
brazier
with
a
fire
in
it
,
and
she
had
no
company
or
prospect
of
company
,
that
I
could
see
,
but
the
old
man
who
had
brought
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
telling
her
a
long
story
(
of
robbers
outside
the
walls
being
taken
up
by
a
stone
statue
of
a
Saint
)
,
to
entertain
her
---
as
he
said
to
me
when
I
came
out
,
"
because
he
had
a
daughter
of
his
own
,
though
she
was
not
so
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
ought
now
to
mention
Mr
Gowan
,
before
I
say
what
little
more
I
have
to
say
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
admire
her
beauty
,
and
he
must
be
proud
of
her
,
for
everybody
praises
it
,
and
he
must
be
fond
of
her
,
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
he
is
---
but
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
his
way
,
and
if
it
appears
as
careless
and
discontented
in
your
eyes
as
it
does
in
mine
,
I
am
not
wrong
in
thinking
that
it
might
be
better
suited
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
does
not
seem
so
to
you
,
I
am
quite
sure
I
am
wholly
mistaken
;
for
your
unchanged
poor
child
confides
in
your
knowledge
and
goodness
more
than
she
could
ever
tell
you
if
she
was
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
be
frightened
,
I
am
not
going
to
try
.
<EOS>
Owing
(
as
I
think
,
if
you
think
so
too
)
to
Mr
Gowan
's
unsettled
and
dissatisfied
way
,
he
applies
himself
to
his
profession
very
little
.
   
<EOS>
He
does
nothing
steadily
or
patiently
;
but
equally
takes
things
up
and
throws
them
down
,
and
does
them
,
or
leaves
them
undone
,
without
caring
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
have
heard
him
talking
to
Papa
during
the
sittings
for
the
picture
,
I
have
sat
wondering
whether
it
could
be
that
he
has
no
belief
in
anybody
else
,
because
he
has
no
belief
in
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
you
will
say
when
you
come
to
this
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
how
you
will
look
,
and
I
can
almost
hear
the
voice
in
which
you
would
tell
me
on
the
Iron
Bridge
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gowan
goes
out
a
good
deal
among
what
is
considered
the
best
company
here
---
though
he
does
not
look
as
if
he
enjoyed
it
or
liked
it
when
he
is
with
it
---
and
she
sometimes
accompanies
him
,
but
lately
she
has
gone
out
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
noticed
that
they
have
an
inconsistent
way
of
speaking
about
her
,
as
if
she
had
made
some
great
self
-
interested
success
in
marrying
Mr
Gowan
,
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
very
same
people
,
would
not
have
dreamed
of
taking
him
for
themselves
or
their
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
goes
into
the
country
besides
,
to
think
about
making
sketches
;
and
in
all
places
where
there
are
visitors
,
he
has
a
large
acquaintance
and
is
very
well
known
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
all
this
,
he
has
a
friend
who
is
much
in
his
society
both
at
home
and
away
from
home
,
though
he
treats
this
friend
very
coolly
and
is
very
uncertain
in
his
behaviour
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
(
because
she
has
told
me
so
)
,
that
she
does
not
like
this
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
so
revolting
to
me
,
too
,
that
his
being
away
from
here
,
at
present
,
is
quite
a
relief
to
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
more
to
hers
!
   
<EOS>
But
what
I
particularly
want
you
to
know
,
and
why
I
have
resolved
to
tell
you
so
much
while
I
am
afraid
it
may
make
you
a
little
uncomfortable
without
occasion
,
is
this
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
so
true
and
so
devoted
,
and
knows
so
completely
that
all
her
love
and
duty
are
his
for
ever
,
that
you
may
be
certain
she
will
love
him
,
<EOS>
admire
him
,
praise
him
,
and
conceal
all
his
faults
,
until
she
dies
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
she
conceals
them
,
and
always
will
conceal
them
,
even
from
herself
.
   
<EOS>
She
has
given
him
a
heart
that
can
never
be
taken
back
;
and
however
much
he
may
try
it
<EOS>
,
he
will
never
wear
out
its
affection
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
truth
of
this
,
as
you
know
everything
,
far
far
better
than
I
;
but
I
can
not
help
telling
you
what
a
nature
she
shows
,
and
that
you
can
never
think
too
well
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
called
her
by
her
name
in
this
letter
,
but
we
are
such
friends
now
that
I
do
so
when
we
are
quietly
together
,
and
she
speaks
to
me
by
my
name
---
<EOS>
I
mean
,
not
my
Christian
name
,
but
the
name
you
gave
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
began
to
call
me
Amy
,
I
told
her
my
short
story
,
and
that
you
had
always
called
me
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
the
name
was
much
dearer
to
me
than
any
other
,
and
so
she
calls
me
Little
Dorrit
too
.
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
have
not
heard
from
her
father
or
mother
yet
,
and
may
not
know
that
she
has
a
baby
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
born
only
two
days
ago
,
and
just
a
week
after
they
came
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
made
them
very
happy
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
must
tell
you
,
as
I
am
to
tell
you
all
,
that
I
fancy
they
are
under
a
constraint
with
Mr
Gowan
,
and
that
they
feel
as
if
his
mocking
way
with
them
was
sometimes
a
slight
given
to
their
love
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
<EOS>
but
yesterday
,
when
I
was
there
,
that
I
saw
Mr
Meagles
change
colour
,
and
get
up
and
go
out
,
as
if
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
say
so
,
unless
he
prevented
himself
by
that
means
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
am
sure
they
are
both
so
considerate
,
good
-
humoured
,
and
reasonable
,
that
he
might
spare
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
hard
in
him
not
to
think
of
them
a
little
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
stopped
at
the
last
full
stop
to
read
all
this
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
at
first
as
if
I
was
taking
on
myself
to
understand
and
explain
so
much
,
that
I
was
half
inclined
not
to
send
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
thought
it
over
a
little
,
I
felt
more
hopeful
for
your
knowing
at
once
that
I
had
only
been
watchful
for
you
,
and
had
only
noticed
what
I
think
I
have
noticed
,
because
I
was
quickened
by
your
interest
in
it
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
you
may
be
sure
that
is
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
I
have
done
with
the
subject
in
the
present
letter
,
and
have
little
left
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
We
are
all
quite
well
,
and
Fanny
improves
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
think
how
kind
she
is
to
me
,
and
what
pains
she
takes
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
a
lover
,
who
has
followed
her
,
first
all
the
way
from
Switzerland
,
and
then
all
the
way
from
Venice
,
and
who
has
just
confided
to
me
that
he
means
to
follow
her
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
much
confused
by
his
speaking
to
me
about
it
,
but
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
but
at
last
I
told
him
that
I
thought
he
had
better
not
.
 
<EOS>
For
Fanny
<EOS>
(
but
I
did
not
tell
him
this
)
is
much
too
spirited
and
clever
to
suit
him
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
he
said
he
would
,
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
lover
,
of
course
.
   
<EOS>
If
you
should
ever
get
so
far
as
this
in
this
long
letter
,
you
will
perhaps
say
,
Surely
Little
Dorrit
will
not
leave
off
without
telling
me
something
about
her
travels
,
and
surely
it
is
time
she
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
indeed
,
but
I
do
n't
know
what
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Since
we
left
Venice
we
have
been
in
a
great
many
wonderful
places
,
Genoa
and
Florence
among
them
,
and
have
seen
so
many
wonderful
sights
,
that
I
am
almost
giddy
when
I
think
what
a
crowd
they
make
.
   
<EOS>
But
you
can
tell
me
so
much
more
about
them
than
I
can
tell
you
,
that
why
should
I
tire
you
with
my
accounts
and
descriptions
?
   
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Clennam
,
as
I
had
the
courage
to
tell
you
what
the
familiar
difficulties
in
my
travelling
mind
were
before
,
I
will
not
be
a
coward
now
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
my
frequent
thoughts
is
this
:
---
 
Old
as
these
cities
are
,
their
age
itself
is
hardly
so
curious
,
to
my
reflections
,
as
that
they
should
have
been
in
their
places
all
through
those
days
when
I
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
more
than
two
or
three
of
them
,
and
when
I
scarcely
knew
of
anything
outside
our
old
walls
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
melancholy
in
it
,
and
I
do
n't
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
went
to
see
the
famous
leaning
tower
at
Pisa
,
it
was
a
bright
sunny
day
,
and
it
and
the
buildings
near
it
looked
so
old
,
and
the
earth
and
the
sky
looked
so
young
,
and
its
shadow
on
the
ground
was
so
soft
and
retired
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
at
first
think
how
beautiful
it
was
,
or
how
curious
,
but
I
thought
,
"
O
how
many
times
when
the
shadow
of
the
wall
was
falling
on
our
room
,
and
when
that
weary
tread
of
feet
was
going
up
and
down
the
yard
---
<EOS>
O
how
many
times
this
place
was
just
as
quiet
and
lovely
as
it
is
to
-
day
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
quite
overpowered
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
was
so
full
that
tears
burst
out
of
my
eyes
,
though
I
did
what
I
could
to
restrain
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
the
same
feeling
often
---
often
.
   
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
since
the
change
in
our
fortunes
,
though
I
appear
to
myself
to
have
dreamed
more
than
before
,
I
have
always
dreamed
of
myself
as
very
young
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
very
old
,
you
may
say
.
<EOS>
No
,
but
that
is
not
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
dreamed
of
myself
as
a
child
learning
to
do
needlework
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
dreamed
of
myself
as
back
there
,
seeing
faces
in
the
yard
little
known
,
and
which
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
I
had
quite
forgotten
;
but
,
as
often
as
not
,
I
have
been
abroad
here
---
in
Switzerland
,
or
France
,
or
Italy
---
somewhere
where
we
have
been
---
yet
always
as
that
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
dreamed
of
going
down
to
Mrs
General
,
with
the
patches
on
my
clothes
in
which
I
can
first
remember
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
over
and
over
again
<EOS>
dreamed
of
taking
my
place
at
dinner
at
Venice
when
we
have
had
a
large
company
,
in
the
mourning
for
my
poor
mother
which
I
wore
when
I
was
eight
years
old
,
and
wore
long
after
it
was
threadbare
and
would
mend
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
a
great
distress
to
me
to
think
how
irreconcilable
the
company
would
consider
it
with
my
father
's
wealth
,
and
how
I
should
displease
and
disgrace
him
and
Fanny
and
Edward
by
so
plainly
disclosing
what
they
wished
to
keep
secret
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
grown
out
of
the
little
child
in
thinking
of
it
;
and
at
the
self
-
same
moment
I
have
dreamed
that
I
have
sat
with
the
heart
-
ache
at
table
,
calculating
the
expenses
of
the
dinner
,
and
quite
distracting
myself
with
thinking
how
they
were
ever
to
be
made
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
dreamed
of
the
change
in
our
fortunes
itself
;
I
have
never
dreamed
of
your
coming
back
with
me
that
memorable
morning
to
break
it
;
I
have
never
even
dreamed
of
you
.
   
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Clennam
,
it
is
possible
that
I
have
thought
of
you
---
and
others
---
so
much
by
day
,
that
I
have
no
thoughts
left
to
wander
round
you
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
must
now
confess
to
you
that
I
suffer
from
home
-
sickness
---
that
I
long
so
ardently
and
earnestly
for
home
,
as
sometimes
,
when
no
one
sees
me
,
to
pine
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
turn
my
face
further
away
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
is
a
little
lightened
when
we
turn
towards
it
,
even
for
a
few
miles
,
and
with
the
knowledge
that
we
are
soon
to
turn
away
again
.
 
<EOS>
So
dearly
do
I
love
the
scene
of
my
poverty
and
your
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
O
so
dearly
,
O
so
dearly
!
   
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
when
your
poor
child
will
see
England
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
fond
of
the
life
here
(
except
me
)
,
and
there
are
no
plans
for
our
return
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
father
talks
of
a
visit
to
London
late
in
this
next
spring
,
on
some
affairs
connected
with
the
property
,
but
I
have
no
hope
that
he
will
bring
me
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
get
on
a
little
better
under
Mrs
General
's
instruction
,
and
I
hope
I
am
not
quite
so
dull
as
I
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
begun
to
speak
and
understand
,
almost
easily
,
the
hard
languages
I
told
you
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
remember
,
at
the
moment
when
I
wrote
last
,
that
you
knew
them
both
;
but
I
remembered
it
afterwards
,
and
it
helped
me
on
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
dear
Mr
Clennam
.
<EOS>
Do
not
forget
your
ever
grateful
and
affectionate
               
LITTLE
DORRIT
.
   
<EOS>
PS
.
<EOS>
---
Particularly
remember
that
Minnie
Gowan
deserves
the
best
remembrance
in
which
you
can
hold
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
too
generously
or
too
highly
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
Mr
Pancks
last
time
.
<EOS>
Please
,
if
you
should
see
him
,
give
him
your
Little
Dorrit
's
kind
regard
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
good
to
Little

In
which
a
Great
Patriotic
Conference
is
holden
 
<EOS>
The
famous
name
of
Merdle
became
,
every
day
,
more
famous
in
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
knew
that
the
Merdle
of
such
high
renown
had
ever
done
any
good
to
any
one
,
alive
or
dead
,
or
to
any
earthly
thing
;
nobody
knew
that
he
had
any
capacity
or
utterance
of
any
sort
in
him
,
which
had
ever
thrown
,
for
any
creature
,
the
feeblest
farthing
-
candle
ray
of
light
on
any
path
of
duty
or
diversion
,
pain
or
pleasure
,
toil
or
rest
,
fact
or
fancy
,
among
the
multiplicity
of
paths
in
the
labyrinth
trodden
by
the
sons
of
Adam
;
nobody
had
the
smallest
reason
for
supposing
the
clay
of
which
this
object
of
worship
was
made
,
to
be
other
than
the
commonest
clay
,
with
as
clogged
a
wick
smouldering
inside
of
it
as
ever
kept
an
image
of
humanity
from
tumbling
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
All
people
knew
(
or
thought
they
knew
)
that
he
had
made
himself
immensely
rich
;
and
,
for
that
reason
alone
,
prostrated
themselves
before
him
,
more
degradedly
and
less
excusably
than
the
darkest
savage
creeps
out
of
his
hole
in
the
ground
to
propitiate
,
in
some
log
or
reptile
,
the
Deity
of
his
benighted
soul
.
   
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
high
priests
of
this
worship
had
the
man
before
them
as
a
protest
against
their
meanness
.
 
<EOS>
The
multitude
worshipped
on
trust
---
though
always
distinctly
knowing
why
---
but
the
officiators
at
the
altar
had
the
man
habitually
in
their
view
.
 
<EOS>
They
sat
at
his
feasts
,
and
he
sat
at
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
spectre
always
attendant
on
him
,
saying
to
these
high
priests
,
"
Are
such
the
signs
you
trust
,
and
love
to
honour
;
this
head
,
these
eyes
,
this
mode
of
speech
,
the
tone
and
manner
of
this
man
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
the
levers
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
and
the
rulers
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
When
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
you
fall
out
by
the
ears
,
it
seems
that
mother
earth
can
give
birth
to
no
other
rulers
.
 
<EOS>
Does
your
qualification
lie
in
the
superior
knowledge
of
men
which
accepts
,
courts
,
and
puffs
this
man
?
 
<EOS>
Or
,
if
you
are
competent
to
judge
aright
the
signs
I
never
fail
to
show
you
when
he
appears
among
you
<EOS>
,
is
your
superior
honesty
your
qualification
?
"
 
<EOS>
Two
rather
ugly
questions
these
,
always
going
about
town
with
Mr
Merdle
;
and
there
was
a
tacit
agreement
that
they
must
be
stifled
.
 
<EOS>
In
Mrs
Merdle
's
absence
abroad
,
Mr
Merdle
still
kept
the
great
house
open
for
the
passage
through
it
of
a
stream
Of
visitors
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
of
these
took
affable
possession
of
the
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
Three
or
four
ladies
of
distinction
and
liveliness
used
to
say
to
one
another
,
"
Let
us
dine
at
our
dear
Merdle
's
next
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
Whom
shall
we
have
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Our
dear
Merdle
would
then
receive
his
instructions
;
and
would
sit
heavily
among
the
company
at
table
and
wander
lumpishly
about
his
drawing
-
rooms
afterwards
,
only
remarkable
for
appearing
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
entertainment
beyond
being
in
its
way
.
   
<EOS>
The
Chief
Butler
,
the
Avenging
Spirit
of
this
great
man
's
life
,
relaxed
nothing
of
his
severity
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
on
at
these
dinners
when
the
bosom
was
not
there
,
as
he
looked
on
at
other
dinners
when
the
bosom
was
there
;
and
his
eye
was
a
basilisk
to
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
hard
man
,
and
would
never
bate
an
ounce
of
plate
or
a
bottle
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
a
dinner
to
be
given
,
unless
it
was
up
to
his
mark
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
forth
the
table
for
his
own
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
guests
chose
to
partake
of
what
was
served
,
he
saw
no
objection
;
but
it
was
served
for
the
maintenance
of
his
rank
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
stood
by
the
sideboard
he
seemed
to
announce
,
"
I
have
accepted
office
to
look
at
this
which
is
now
before
me
,
and
to
look
at
nothing
less
than
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
If
he
missed
the
presiding
bosom
,
it
was
as
a
part
of
his
own
state
of
which
he
was
,
from
unavoidable
circumstances
,
temporarily
deprived
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
he
might
have
missed
a
centre
-
piece
,
or
a
choice
wine
-
cooler
,
which
had
been
sent
to
the
Banker
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
issued
invitations
for
a
Barnacle
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
was
to
be
there
,
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
was
to
be
there
,
the
pleasant
young
Barnacle
was
to
be
there
;
and
the
Chorus
of
Parliamentary
Barnacles
who
went
about
the
provinces
when
the
House
was
up
,
warbling
the
praises
of
their
Chief
,
were
to
be
represented
there
.
<EOS>
It
was
understood
to
be
a
great
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
was
going
to
take
up
the
Barnacles
.
 
<EOS>
Some
delicate
little
negotiations
had
occurred
between
him
and
the
noble
Decimus
---
the
young
Barnacle
of
engaging
manners
acting
as
negotiator
---
and
Mr
Merdle
had
decided
to
cast
the
weight
of
his
great
probity
and
great
riches
into
the
Barnacle
scale
.
 
<EOS>
jobbery
was
suspected
by
the
malicious
;
perhaps
because
it
was
indisputable
that
if
the
adherence
of
the
immortal
Enemy
of
Mankind
could
have
been
secured
by
a
job
,
the
Barnacles
would
have
jobbed
him
---
for

Mrs
Merdle
had
written
to
this
magnificent
spouse
of
hers
,
whom
it
was
heresy
to
regard
as
anything
less
than
all
the
British
Merchants
since
the
days
of
Whittington
rolled
into
one
,
and
gilded
three
feet
deep
all
over
---
had
written
to
this
spouse
of
hers
,
several
letters
from
Rome
,
in
quick
succession
,
urging
upon
him
with
importunity
that
now
or
never
was
the
time
to
provide
for
Edmund
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
had
shown
him
that
the
case
of
Edmund
was
urgent
,
and
that
infinite
advantages
might
result
from
his
having
some
good
thing
directly
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
grammar
of
Mrs
Merdle
's
verbs
on
this
momentous
subject
,
there
was
only
one
mood
,
the
Imperative
;
and
that
Mood
had
only
one
Tense
,
the
Present
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
's
verbs
were
so
pressingly
presented
to
Mr
Merdle
to
conjugate
,
that
his
sluggish
blood
and
his
long
coat
-
cuffs
became
quite
agitated
.
   
<EOS>
In
which
state
of
agitation
,
Mr
Merdle
,
evasively
rolling
his
eyes
round
the
Chief
Butler
's
shoes
without
raising
them
to
the
index
of
that
stupendous
creature
's
thoughts
,
had
signified
to
him
his
intention
of
giving
a
special
dinner
:
not
a
very
large
dinner
,
but
a
very
special
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
The
Chief
Butler
had
signified
,
in
return
,
that
he
had
no
objection
to
look
on
at
the
most
expensive
thing
in
that
way
that
could
be
done
;
and
the
day
of
the
dinner
was
now
come
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
stood
in
one
of
his
drawing
-
rooms
,
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
his
important
guests
.
 
<EOS>
He
seldom
or
never
took
the
liberty
of
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
unless
he
was
quite
alone
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
presence
of
the
Chief
Butler
,
he
could
not
have
done
such
a
deed
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
clasped
himself
by
the
wrists
in
that
constabulary
manner
of
his
,
and
have
paced
up
and
down
the
hearthrug
,
or
gone
creeping
about
among
the
rich
objects
of
furniture
,
if
his
oppressive
retainer
had
appeared
in
the
room
at
that
very
moment
.
 
<EOS>
The
sly
shadows
which
seemed
to
dart
out
of
hiding
when
the
fire
rose
,
and
to
dart
back
into
it
when
the
fire
fell
,
were
sufficient
witnesses
of
his
making
himself
so
easy
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
even
more
than
sufficient
,
if
his
uncomfortable
glances
at
them
might
be
taken
to
mean
anything
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
's
right
hand
was
filled
with
the
evening
paper
,
and
the
evening
paper
was
full
of
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
His
wonderful
enterprise
,
his
wonderful
wealth
,
his
wonderful
Bank
,
were
the
fattening
food
of
the
evening
paper
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
wonderful
Bank
,
of
which
he
was
the
chief
projector
,
establisher
,
and
manager
,
was
the
latest
of
the
many
Merdle
wonders
.
 
<EOS>
So
modest
was
Mr
Merdle
withal
,
in
the
midst
of
these
splendid
achievements
,
that
he
looked
far
more
like
a
man
in
possession
of
his
house
under
a
distraint
,
than
a
commercial
Colossus
bestriding
his
own
hearthrug
,
while
the
little
ships
were
sailing
into
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
Behold
the
vessels
coming
into
port
!
 
<EOS>
The
engaging
young
Barnacle
was
the
first
arrival
;
but
Bar
overtook
him
on
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
,
strengthened
as
usual
with
his
double
eye
-
glass
and
his
little
jury
droop
,
was
overjoyed
to
see
the
engaging
young
Barnacle
;
and
opined
that
we
were
going
to
sit
in
Banco
,
as
we
lawyers
called
it
,
to
take
a
special
argument
?
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
the
sprightly
young
Barnacle
,
whose
name
was
Ferdinand
;
"
<EOS>
how
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
smiled
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
know
,
how
can
I
know
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
in
the
innermost
sanctuary
of
the
temple
;
I
am
one
of
the
admiring
concourse
on
the
plain
without
.
"
   
<EOS>
Bar
could
be
light
in
hand
,
or
heavy
in
hand
,
according
to
the
customer
he
had
to
deal
with
.
 
<EOS>
With
Ferdinand
Barnacle
he
was
gossamer
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
was
likewise
always
modest
and
self
-
depreciatory
---
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
was
a
man
of
great
variety
;
but
one
leading
thread
ran
through
the
woof
of
all
his
patterns
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
with
whom
he
had
to
do
was
in
his
eyes
a
jury
-
man
;
and
he
must
get
that
jury
-
man
over
,
if
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Our
illustrious
host
and
friend
,
"
said
Bar
;
"
our
shining
mercantile
star
;
---
going
into
politics
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
?
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
in
Parliament
some
time
,
you
know
<EOS>
,
"
returned
the
engaging
young
Barnacle
.
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
said
Bar
,
with
his
light
-
comedy
laugh
for
special
jury
-
men
,
which
was
a
very
different
thing
from
his
low
-
comedy
laugh
for
comic
tradesmen
on
common
juries
:
"
he
has
been
in
Parliament
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
hitherto
our
star
has
been
a
vacillating
and
wavering
star
?
 
<EOS>
Humph
?
"
   
<EOS>
An
average
witness
would
have
been
seduced
by
the
Humph
?
 
<EOS>
into
an
affirmative
answer
,
<EOS>
But
Ferdinand
Barnacle
looked
knowingly
at
Bar
as
he
strolled
up
-
stairs
,
and
gave
him
no
answer
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
just
so
,
"
said
Bar
,
nodding
his
head
,
for
he
was
not
to
be
put
off
in
that
way
,
"
and
therefore
I
spoke
of
our
sitting
in
Banco
to
take
a
special
argument
---
meaning
this
to
be
a
high
and
solemn
occasion
,
when
,
as
Captain
Macheath
says
,
"
the
judges
are
met
:
a
terrible
show
!
<EOS>
"
We
lawyers
are
sufficiently
liberal
,
you
see
,
to
quote
the
Captain
,
though
the
Captain
is
severe
upon
us
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
think
I
could
put
in
evidence
an
admission
of
the
Captain
's
,
"
said
Bar
,
with
a
little
jocose
roll
of
his
head
;
for
,
in
his
legal
current
of
speech
,
he
always
assumed
the
air
of
rallying
himself
with
the
best
grace
in
the
world
;
"
an
admission
of
the
Captain
's
that
Law
,
in
the
gross
,
is
at
least
intended
to
be
impartial
.
 
<EOS>
For
what
says
the
Captain
,
if
I
quote
him
correctly
---
and
if
not
,
"
with
a
light
-
comedy
touch
of
his
double
eye
-
glass
on
his
companion
's
shoulder
,
"
my
learned
friend
will
set
me
right
:
    
"
Since
laws
were
made
for
every
degree
,
     
To
curb
vice
in
others
as
well
as
in
me
,
     
<EOS>
I
wonder
we
ha'n't
better
company
     
<EOS>
Upon
Tyburn
Tree
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
These
words
brought
them
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
Mr
Merdle
stood
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
So
immensely
astounded
was
Mr
Merdle
by
the
entrance
of
Bar
with
such
a
reference
in
his
mouth
,
that
Bar
explained
himself
to
have
been
quoting
Gay
.
 
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
not
one
of
our
Westminster
Hall
authorities
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
still
no
despicable
one
to
a
man
possessing
the
largely
-
practical
Mr
Merdle
's
knowledge
of
the
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
looked
as
if
he
thought
he
would
say
something
,
but
subsequently
looked
as
if
he
thought
he
would
n't
.
 
<EOS>
The
interval
afforded
time
for
Bishop
to
be
announced
.
<EOS>
Bishop
came
in
with
meekness
,
and
yet
with
a
strong
and
rapid
step
as
if
he
wanted
to
get
his
seven
-
league
dress
-
shoes
on
,
and
go
round
the
world
to
see
that
everybody
was
in
a
satisfactory
state
.
<EOS>
Bishop
had
no
idea
that
there
was
anything
significant
in
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
most
remarkable
trait
in
his
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
crisp
,
fresh
,
cheerful
,
affable
,
bland
;
but
so
surprisingly
innocent
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
sidled
up
to
prefer
his
politest
inquiries
in
reference
to
the
health
of
Mrs
Bishop
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bishop
had
been
a
little
unfortunate
in
the
article
of
taking
cold
at
a
Confirmation
,
but
otherwise
was
well
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Mr
Bishop
was
also
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
down
,
with
his
young
wife
and
little
family
,
at
his
Cure
of
Souls
.
 
<EOS>
The
representatives
of
the
Barnacle
Chorus
dropped
in
next
,
and
Mr
Merdle
's
physician
dropped
in
next
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
,
who
had
a
bit
of
one
eye
and
a
bit
of
his
double
eye
-
glass
for
every
one
who
came
in
at
the
door
,
no
matter
with
whom
he
was
conversing
or
what
he
was
talking
about
,
got
among
them
all
by
some
skilful
means
,
without
being
seen
to
get
at
them
,
and
touched
each
individual
gentleman
of
the
jury
on
his
own
individual
favourite
spot
.
 
<EOS>
With
some
of
the
Chorus
,
he
laughed
about
the
sleepy
member
who
had
gone
out
into
the
lobby
the
other
night
,
and
voted
the
wrong
way
:
<EOS>
with
others
,
he
deplored
that
innovating
spirit
in
the
time
which
could
not
even
be
prevented
from
taking
an
unnatural
interest
in
the
public
service
and
the
public
money
:
with
the
physician
he
had
a
word
to
say
about
the
general
health
;
he
had
also
a
little
information
to
ask
him
for
,
concerning
a
professional
man
of
unquestioned
erudition
and
polished
manners
---
but
those
credentials
in
their
highest
development
he
believed
were
the
possession
of
other
professors
of
the
healing
art
(
jury
droop
)
---
whom
he
had
happened
to
have
in
the
witness
-
box
the
day
before
yesterday
,
and
from
whom
he
had
elicited
in
cross
-
examination
that
he
claimed
to
be
one
of
the
exponents
of
this
new
mode
of
treatment
which
appeared
to
Bar
to
---
eh
?
---
<EOS>
well
,
Bar
thought
so
;
Bar
had
thought
,
and
hoped
,
Physician
would
tell
him
so
.
 
<EOS>
Without
presuming
to
decide
where
doctors
disagreed
,
it
did
appear
to
Bar
,
viewing
it
as
a
question
of
common
sense
and
not
of
so
-
called
legal
penetration
,
that
this
new
system
was
---
might
be
,
in
the
presence
of
so
great
an
authority
---
say
,
Humbug
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Fortified
by
such
encouragement
,
he
could
venture
to
say
Humbug
;
and
now
Bar
's
mind
was
relieved
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
,
who
,
like
Dr
johnson
's
celebrated
acquaintance
,
had
only
one
idea
in
his
head
and
that
was
a
wrong
one
,
had
appeared
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
This
eminent
gentleman
and
Mr
Merdle
,
seated
diverse
ways
and
with
ruminating
aspects
on
a
yellow
ottoman
in
the
light
of
the
fire
,
holding
no
verbal
communication
with
each
other
,
bore
a
strong
general
resemblance
to
the
two
cows
in
the
Cuyp
picture
over
against
them
.
   
<EOS>
But
now
,
Lord
Decimus
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
The
Chief
Butler
,
who
up
to
this
time
had
limited
himself
to
a
branch
of
his
usual
function
by
looking
at
the
company
as
they
entered
(
and
that
,
with
more
of
defiance
than
favour
)
,
put
himself
so
far
out
of
his
way
as
to
come
up
-
stairs
with
him
and
announce
him
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
being
an
overpowering
peer
,
a
bashful
young
member
of
the
Lower
House
who
was
the
last
fish
but
one
caught
by
the
Barnacles
,
and
who
had
been
invited
on
this
occasion
to
commemorate
his
capture
,
shut
his
eyes
when
his
Lordship
came
in
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
,
nevertheless
,
was
glad
to
see
the
Member
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
also
glad
to
see
Mr
Merdle
,
glad
to
see
Bishop
,
glad
to
see
Bar
,
glad
to
see
Physician
,
glad
to
see
Tite
Barnacle
,
glad
to
see
Chorus
,
glad
to
see
Ferdinand
his
private
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
,
though
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
earth
,
was
not
remarkable
for
ingratiatory
manners
,
and
Ferdinand
had
coached
him
up
to
the
point
of
noticing
all
the
fellows
he
might
find
there
,
and
saying
he
was
glad
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
achieved
this
rush
of
vivacity
and
condescension
,
his
Lordship
composed
himself
into
the
picture
after
Cuyp
,
and
made
a
third
cow
in
the
group
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
,
who
felt
that
he
had
got
all
the
rest
of
the
jury
and
must
now
lay
hold
of
the
Foreman
,
soon
came
sidling
up
,
double
eye
-
glass
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
tendered
the
weather
,
as
a
subject
neatly
aloof
from
official
reserve
,
for
the
Foreman
's
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
said
that
he
was
told
(
as
everybody
always
is
told
,
though
who
tells
them
,
and
why
,
will
ever
remain
a
mystery
)
,
that
there
was
to
be
no
wall
-
fruit
this
year
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
had
not
heard
anything
amiss
of
his
peaches
,
but
rather
believed
,
if
his
people
were
correct
,
he
was
to
have
no
apples
.
 
<EOS>
No
apples
?
 
<EOS>
Bar
was
lost
in
astonishment
and
concern
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
all
one
to
him
,
in
reality
,
if
there
had
not
been
a
pippin
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
but
his
show
of
interest
in
this
apple
question
was
positively
painful
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
to
what
,
Lord
Decimus
---
for
we
troublesome
lawyers
loved
to
gather
information
,
and
could
never
tell
how
useful
it
might
prove
to
us
---
to
what
,
Lord
Decimus
,
was
this
to
be
attributed
?
 
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
could
not
undertake
to
propound
any
theory
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
might
have
stopped
another
man
;
but
Bar
,
sticking
to
him
fresh
as
ever
,
said
,
"
As
to
pears
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
Long
after
Bar
got
made
Attorney
-
General
,
this
was
told
of
him
as
a
master
-
stroke
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
had
a
reminiscence
about
a
pear
-
tree
formerly
growing
in
a
garden
near
the
back
of
his
dame
's
house
at
Eton
,
upon
which
pear
-
tree
the
only
joke
of
his
life
perennially
bloomed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
joke
of
a
compact
and
portable
nature
,
turning
on
the
difference
between
Eton
pears
and
Parliamentary
pairs
;
but
it
was
a
joke
,
a
refined
relish
of
which
would
seem
to
have
appeared
to
Lord
Decimus
impossible
to
be
had
without
a
thorough
and
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
the
story
at
first
had
no
idea
of
such
a
tree
,
sir
,
then
gradually
found
it
in
winter
,
carried
it
through
the
changing
season
,
saw
it
bud
,
saw
it
blossom
,
saw
it
bear
fruit
,
saw
the
fruit
ripen
;
in
short
,
cultivated
the
tree
in
that
diligent
and
minute
manner
before
it
got
out
of
the
bed
-
room
window
to
steal
the
fruit
,
that
many
thanks
had
been
offered
up
by
belated
listeners
for
the
trees
having
been
planted
and
grafted
prior
to
Lord
Decimus
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
's
interest
in
apples
was
so
overtopped
by
the
wrapt
suspense
in
which
he
pursued
the
changes
of
these
pears
,
from
the
moment
when
Lord
Decimus
solemnly
opened
with
"
Your
mentioning
pears
recalls
to
my
remembrance
a
pear
-
tree
,
"
down
to
the
rich
conclusion
,
"
<EOS>
And
so
we
pass
,
through
the
various
changes
of
life
,
from
Eton
pears
to
Parliamentary
pairs
,
"
that
he
had
to
go
down
-
stairs
with
Lord
Decimus
,
and
even
then
to
be
seated
next
to
him
at
table
in
order
that
he
might
hear
the
anecdote
out
.
 
<EOS>
By
that
time
,
Bar
felt
that
he
had
secured
the
Foreman
,
and
might
go
to
dinner
with
a
good
appetite
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
dinner
to
provoke
an
appetite
,
though
he
had
not
had
one
.
<EOS>
The
rarest
dishes
,
sumptuously
cooked
and
sumptuously
served
;
the
choicest
fruits
;
the
most
exquisite
wines
;
marvels
of
workmanship
in
gold
and
silver
,
china
and
glass
;
innumerable
things
delicious
to
the
senses
of
taste
,
smell
,
and
sight
,
were
insinuated
into
its
composition
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
what
a
wonderful
man
this
Merdle
,
what
a
great
man
,
what
a
master
man
,
how
blessedly
and
enviably
endowed
---
in
one
word
,
what
a
rich
man
!
   
<EOS>
He
took
his
usual
poor
eighteenpennyworth
of
food
in
his
usual
indigestive
way
,
and
had
as
little
to
say
for
himself
as
ever
a
wonderful
man
had
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
Lord
Decimus
was
one
of
those
sublimities
who
have
no
occasion
to
be
talked
to
,
for
they
can
be
at
any
time
sufficiently
occupied
with
the
contemplation
of
their
own
greatness
.
 
<EOS>
This
enabled
the
bashful
young
Member
to
keep
his
eyes
open
long
enough
at
a
time
to
see
his
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
whenever
Lord
Decimus
spoke
,
he
shut
them
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
agreeable
young
Barnacle
,
and
Bar
,
were
the
talkers
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
would
have
been
exceedingly
agreeable
also
,
but
that
his
innocence
stood
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
soon
left
behind
.
 
<EOS>
When
there
was
any
little
hint
of
anything
being
in
the
wind
,
he
got
lost
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Worldly
affairs
were
too
much
for
him
;
he
could
n't
make
them
out
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
observable
when
Bar
said
,
incidentally
,
that
he
was
happy
to
have
heard
that
we
were
soon
to
have
the
advantage
of
enlisting
on
the
good
side
,
the
sound
and
plain
sagacity
---
not
demonstrative
or
ostentatious
,
but
thoroughly
sound
and
practical
---
of
our
friend
Mr
Sparkler
.
   
<EOS>
Ferdinand
Barnacle
laughed
,
and
said
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
he
believed
so
.
 
<EOS>
A
vote
was
a
vote
,
and
always
acceptable
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
was
sorry
to
miss
our
good
friend
Mr
Sparkler
to
-
day
,
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
away
with
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
,
slowly
coming
out
of
a
long
abstraction
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
had
been
fitting
a
tablespoon
up
his
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
indispensable
for
him
to
be
on
the
spot
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
magic
name
of
Merdle
,
"
said
Bar
,
with
the
jury
droop
,
"
no
doubt
will
suffice
for
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
---
yes
---
I
believe
so
,
"
assented
Mr
Merdle
,
putting
the
spoon
aside
,
and
clumsily
hiding
each
of
his
hands
in
the
coat
-
cuff
of
the
other
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
the
people
in
my
interest
down
there
will
not
make
any
difficulty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Model
people
!
"
said
Bar
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
approve
of
them
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
people
of
those
other
two
places
,
now
,
"
pursued
Bar
,
with
a
bright
twinkle
in
his
keen
eye
,
as
it
slightly
turned
in
the
direction
of
his
magnificent
neighbour
;
"
we
lawyers
are
always
curious
,
always
inquisitive
,
always
picking
up
odds
and
ends
for
our
patchwork
minds
,
since
there
is
no
knowing
when
and
where
they
may
fit
into
some
corner
;
---
the
people
of
those
other
two
places
now
?
 
<EOS>
Do
they
yield
so
laudably
to
the
vast
and
cumulative
influence
of
such
enterprise
and
such
renown
;
do
those
little
rills
become
absorbed
so
quietly
and
easily
,
and
,
as
it
were
by
the
influence
of
natural
laws
,
so
beautifully
,
in
the
swoop
of
the
majestic
stream
as
it
flows
upon
its
wondrous
way
enriching
the
surrounding
lands
;
that
their
course
is
perfectly
to
be
calculated
,
and
distinctly
to
be
predicated
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
,
a
little
troubled
by
Bar
's
eloquence
,
looked
fitfully
about
the
nearest
salt
-
cellar
for
some
moments
,
and
then
said
hesitating
:
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
perfectly
aware
,
sir
,
of
their
duty
to
Society
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
return
anybody
I
send
to
them
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cheering
to
know
,
"
said
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cheering
to
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
three
places
in
question
were
three
little
rotten
holes
in
this
Island
,
containing
three
little
ignorant
,
drunken
,
guzzling
,
dirty
,
out
-
of
-
the

way
constituencies
,
that
had
reeled
into
Mr
Merdle
's
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
Barnacle
laughed
in
his
easy
way
,
and
airily
said
they
were
a
nice
set
of
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
,
mentally
perambulating
among
paths
of
peace
,
was
altogether
swallowed
up
in
absence
of
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
asked
Lord
Decimus
,
casting
his
eyes
around
the
table
,
"
what
is
this
story
I
have
heard
of
a
gentleman
long
confined
in
a
debtors
'
prison
proving
to
be
of
a
wealthy
family
,
and
having
come
into
the
inheritance
of
a
large
sum
of
money
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
met
with
a
variety
of
allusions
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
anything
of
it
,
Ferdinand
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
this
much
,
"
said
Ferdinand
,
"
that
he
has
given
the
Department
with
which
I
have
the
honour
to
be
associated
;
"
this
sparkling
young
Barnacle
threw
off
the
phrase
sportively
,
as
who
should
say
,
We
know
all
about
these
forms
of
speech
,
but
we
must
keep
it
up
,
we
must
keep
the
game
alive
;
"
no
end
of
trouble
,
and
has
put
us
into
innumerable
fixes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fixes
?
"
repeated
Lord
Decimus
,
with
a
majestic
pausing
and
pondering
on
the
word
that
made
the
bashful
Member
shut
his
eyes
quite
tight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fixes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
perplexing
business
indeed
,
"
observed
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
,
with
an
air
of
grave
resentment
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
said
Lord
Decimus
,
"
was
the
character
of
his
business
;
what
was
the
nature
of
these
---
a
---
Fixes
,
Ferdinand
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
a
good
story
,
as
a
story
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
;
"
as
good
a
thing
of
its
kind
as
need
be
.
 
<EOS>
This
Mr
Dorrit
(
his
name
is
Dorrit
)
had
incurred
a
responsibility
to
us
,
ages
before
the
fairy
came
out
of
the
Bank
and
gave
him
his
fortune
,
under
a
bond
he
had
signed
for
the
performance
of
a
contract
which
was
not
at
all
performed
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
partner
in
a
house
in
some
large
way
---
spirits
,
or
buttons
,
or
wine
,
or
blacking
,
or
oatmeal
,
or
woollen
,
or
pork
,
or
hooks
and
eyes
,
or
iron
,
or
treacle
,
or
shoes
,
or
something
or
other
that
was
wanted
for
troops
,
or
seamen
,
or
somebody
---
and
the
house
burst
,
and
we
being
among
the
creditors
<EOS>
,
detainees
were
lodged
on
the
part
of
the
Crown
in
a
scientific
manner
,
and
all
the
rest
Of
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
fairy
had
appeared
and
he
wanted
to
pay
us
off
,
Egad
we
had
got
into
such
an
exemplary
state
of
checking
and
counter
-
checking
,
signing
and
counter
-
signing
,
that
it
was
six
months
before
we
knew
how
to
take
the
money
,
or
how
to
give
a
receipt
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
triumph
of
public
business
,
"
said
this
handsome
young
Barnacle
,
laughing
heartily
,
<EOS>
"
You
never
saw
such
a
lot
of
forms
in
your
life
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
the
attorney
said
to
me
one
day
,
"
if
I
wanted
this
office
to
give
me
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
instead
of
take
it
,
I
could
n't
have
more
trouble
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
old
fellow
,
"
I
told
him
,
"
and
in
future
you
'll
know
that
we
have
something
to
do
here
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
pleasant
young
Barnacle
finished
by
once
more
laughing
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
easy
,
pleasant
fellow
indeed
,
and
his
manners
were
exceedingly
winning
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
's
view
of
the
business
was
of
a
less
airy
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
ill
that
Mr
Dorrit
had
troubled
the
Department
by
wanting
to
pay
the
money
,
and
considered
it
a
grossly
informal
thing
to
do
after
so
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
was
a
buttoned
-
up
man
,
and
consequently
a
weighty
one
.
 
<EOS>
All
buttoned
-
up
men
are
weighty
.
 
<EOS>
All
buttoned
-
up
men
are
believed
in
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
the
reserved
and
never
-
exercised
power
of
unbuttoning
,
fascinates
mankind
;
whether
or
no
wisdom
is
supposed
to
condense
and
augment
when
buttoned
up
,
and
to
evaporate
when
unbuttoned
<EOS>
;
it
is
certain
that
the
man
to
whom
importance
is
accorded
is
the
buttoned
-
up
man
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
never
would
have
passed
for
half
his
current
value
,
unless
his
coat
had
been
always
buttoned
-
up
to
his
white
cravat
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
"
said
Lord
Decimus
,
"
if
Mr
Darrit
---
or
Dorrit
---
has
any
family
?
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
else
replying
,
the
host
said
,
"
He
has
two
daughters
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
you
are
acquainted
with
him
?
"
asked
Lord
Decimus
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Merdle
is
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
is
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
<EOS>
I
rather
believe
that
one
of
the
young
ladies
has
made
an
impression
on
Edmund
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
susceptible
,
and
<EOS>
---
I
---
think
---
the
conquest
---
"
Here
Mr
Merdle
stopped
,
and
looked
at
the
table
-
cloth
,
as
he
usually
did
when
he
found
himself
observed
or
listened
to
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
was
uncommonly
pleased
to
find
that
the
Merdle
family
,
and
this
family
,
had
already
been
brought
into
contact
.
 
<EOS>
He
submitted
,
in
a
low
voice
across
the
table
to
Bishop
,
that
it
was
a
kind
of
analogical
illustration
of
those
physical
laws
,
in
virtue
of
which
<EOS>
Like
flies
to
Like
.
 
<EOS>
He
regarded
this
power
of
attraction
in
wealth
to
draw
wealth
to
it
,
as
something
remarkably
interesting
and
curious
---
something
indefinably
allied
to
the
loadstone
and
gravitation
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
,
who
had
ambled
back
to
earth
again
when
the
present
theme
was
broached
,
acquiesced
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
indeed
highly
important
to
Society
that
one
in
the
trying
situation
of
unexpectedly
finding
himself
invested
with
a
power
for
good
or
for
evil
in
Society
,
should
become
,
as
it
were
,
merged
in
the
superior
power
of
a
more
legitimate
and
more
gigantic
growth
,
the
influence
of
which
(
as
in
the
case
of
our
friend
at
whose
board
we
sat
)
was
habitually
exercised
in
harmony
with
the
best
interests
of
Society
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
instead
of
two
rival
and
contending
flames
,
a
larger
and
a
lesser
,
each
burning
with
a
lurid
and
uncertain
glare
,
we
had
a
blended
and
a
softened
light
whose
genial
ray
diffused
an
equable
warmth
throughout
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
seemed
to
like
his
own
way
of
putting
the
case
very
much
,
and
rather
dwelt
upon
it
;
Bar
,
meanwhile
(
not
to
throw
away
a
jury
-
man
)
,
making
a
show
of
sitting
at
his
feet
and
feeding
on
his
precepts
.
   
<EOS>
The
dinner
and
dessert
being
three
hours
long
,
the
bashful
Member
cooled
in
the
shadow
of
Lord
Decimus
faster
than
he
warmed
with
food
and
drink
,
and
had
but
a
chilly
time
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
,
like
a
tall
tower
in
a
flat
country
,
seemed
to
project
himself
across
the
table
-
cloth
,
hide
the
light
from
the
honourable
Member
,
cool
the
honourable
Member
's
marrow
,
and
give
him
a
woeful
idea
of
distance
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
asked
this
unfortunate
traveller
to
take
wine
,
he
encompassed
his
faltering
steps
with
the
gloomiest
of
shades
;
and
when
he
said
,
"
Your
health
sir
!
"
<EOS>
all
around
him
was
barrenness
and
desolation
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
Lord
Decimus
,
with
a
coffee
-
cup
in
his
hand
,
began
to
hover
about
among
the
pictures
,
and
to
cause
an
interesting
speculation
to
arise
in
all
minds
as
to
the
probabilities
of
his
ceasing
to
hover
,
and
enabling
the
smaller
birds
to
flutter
up
-
stairs
;
which
could
not
be
done
until
he
had
urged
his
noble
pinions
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
delay
,
and
several
stretches
of
his
wings
which
came
to
nothing
,
he
soared
to
the
drawing
-
rooms
.
   
<EOS>
And
here
a
difficulty
arose
,
which
always
does
arise
when
two
people
are
specially
brought
together
at
a
dinner
to
confer
with
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
(
except
Bishop
,
who
had
no
suspicion
of
it
)
knew
perfectly
well
that
this
dinner
had
been
eaten
and
drunk
,
specifically
to
the
end
that
Lord
Decimus
and
Mr
Merdle
should
have
five
minutes
'
conversation
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
opportunity
so
elaborately
prepared
was
now
arrived
,
and
it
seemed
from
that
moment
that
no
mere
human
ingenuity
could
so
much
as
get
the
two
chieftains
into
the
same
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
and
his
noble
guest
persisted
in
prowling
about
at
opposite
ends
of
the
perspective
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
the
engaging
Ferdinand
to
bring
Lord
Decimus
to
look
at
the
bronze
horses
near
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Merdle
evaded
,
and
wandered
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
him
to
bring
Mr
Merdle
to
Lord
Decimus
to
tell
him
the
history
of
the
unique
Dresden
vases
.
<EOS>
Then
Lord
Decimus
evaded
and
wandered
away
,
while
he
was
getting
his
man
up
to
the
mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
thing
as
this
?
"
said
Ferdinand
to
Bar
when
he
had
been
baffled
twenty
times
.
   
<EOS>
"
Often
,
"
returned
Bar
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Unless
I
butt
one
of
them
into
an
appointed
corner
,
and
you
butt
the
other
,
"
said
Ferdinand
,
"
it
will
not
come
off
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
butt
Merdle
,
if
you
like
;
but
not
my
lord
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ferdinand
laughed
,
in
the
midst
of
his
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Confound
them
both
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
get
away
.
 
<EOS>
Why
the
deuce
ca
n't
they
come
together
!
 
<EOS>
They
both
know
what
they
want
and
mean
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
them
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
still
looming
at
opposite
ends
of
the
perspective
,
each
with
an
absurd
pretence
of
not
having
the
other
on
his
mind
,
which
could
not
have
been
more
transparently
ridiculous
though
his
real
mind
had
been
chalked
on
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
,
who
had
just
now
made
a
third
with
Bar
and
Ferdinand
,
but
whose
innocence
had
again
cut
him
out
of
the
subject
and
washed
him
in
sweet
oil
,
was
seen
to
approach
Lord
Decimus
and
glide
into
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
get
Merdle
's
doctor
to
catch
and
secure
him
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Ferdinand
;
"
and
then
I
must
lay
hold
of
my
illustrious
kinsman
,
and
decoy
him
<EOS>
if
I
can
---
drag
him
if
I
ca
n't
---
to
the
conference
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Since
you
do
me
the
honour
,
"
said
Bar
,
with
his
slyest
smile
,
to
ask
for
my
poor
aid
,
it
shall
be
yours
with
the
greatest
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
this
is
to
be
done
by
one
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
will
undertake
to
pen
my
lord
into
that
furthest
drawing
-
room
where
he
is
now
so
profoundly
engaged
,
I
will
undertake
to
bring
our
dear
Merdle
into
the
presence
,
without
the
possibility
of
getting
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Done
!
"
said
Ferdinand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Done
!
"
said
Bar
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
was
a
sight
wondrous
to
behold
,
and
full
of
matter
,
when
,
jauntily
waving
his
double
eye
-
glass
by
its
ribbon
,
and
jauntily
drooping
to
an
Universe
of
jurymen
,
he
,
in
the
most
accidental
manner
ever
seen
,
found
himself
at
Mr
Merdle
's
shoulder
,
and
embraced
that
opportunity
of
mentioning
a
little
point
to
him
,
on
which
he
particularly
wished
to
be
guided
by
the
light
of
his
practical
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
(
Here
he
took
Mr
Merdle
's
arm
and
walked
him
gently
away
.
)
<EOS>
A
banker
,
whom
we
would
call
A*B
,
advanced
a
considerable
sum
of
money
,
which
we
would
call
fifteen
thousand
pounds
,
to
a
client
or
customer
of
his
,
whom
he
would
call
P*Q.
<EOS>
(
Here
,
as
they
were
getting
towards
Lord
Decimus
,
he
held
Mr
Merdle
tight
.
)
<EOS>
As
a
security
for
the
repayment
of
this
advance
to
P*Q
whom
we
would
call
a
widow
lady
,
there
were
placed
in
AB
's
hands
the
title
-
deeds
of
a
freehold
estate
,
which
we
would
call
Blinkiter
Doddles
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
point
was
this
.
 
<EOS>
A
limited
right
of
felling
and
lopping
in
the
woods
of
Blinkiter
Doddles
,
lay
in
the
son
of
P*Q
then
past
his
majority
,
and
whom
we
would
call
X*Y
---
but
really
this
was
too
bad
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
presence
of
Lord
Decimus
,
to
detain
the
host
with
chopping
our
dry
chaff
of
law
,
was
really
too
bad
!
<EOS>
Another
time
!
 
<EOS>
Bar
was
truly
repentant
,
and
would
not
say
another
syllable
.
 
<EOS>
Would
Bishop
favour
him
with
half
-
a
-
dozen
words
?
 
<EOS>
(
He
had
now
set
Mr
Merdle
down
on
a
couch
,
side
by
side
with
Lord
Decimus
,
and
to
it
they
must
go
,
now
or
never
.
)
   
<EOS>
And
now
the
rest
of
the
company
,
highly
excited
and
interested
,
always
excepting
Bishop
,
who
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
anything
was
going
on
,
formed
in
one
group
<EOS>
round
the
fire
in
the
next
drawing
-
room
,
and
pretended
to
be
chatting
easily
on
the
infinite
variety
of
small
topics
,
while
everybody
's
thoughts
and
eyes
were
secretly
straying
towards
the
secluded
pair
.
 
<EOS>
The
Chorus
were
excessively
nervous
,
perhaps
as
labouring
under
the
dreadful
apprehension
that
some
good
thing
was
going
to
be
diverted
from
them
!
 
<EOS>
Bishop
alone
talked
steadily
and
evenly
.
 
<EOS>
He
conversed
with
the
great
Physician
on
that
relaxation
of
the
throat
with
which
young
curates
were
too
frequently
afflicted
,
and
on
the
means
of
lessening
the
great
prevalence
of
that
disorder
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
Physician
,
as
a
general
rule
,
was
of
opinion
that
the
best
way
to
avoid
it
was
to
know
how
to
read
,
before
you
made
a
profession
of
reading
.
 
<EOS>
Bishop
said
dubiously
,
did
he
really
think
so
?
 
<EOS>
And
Physician
said
,
decidedly
,
<EOS>
yes
he
did
.
   
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
meanwhile
,
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
skirmished
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
;
he
kept
about
mid
-
way
between
it
and
the
two
,
as
if
some
sort
of
surgical
operation
were
being
performed
by
Lord
Decimus
on
Mr
Merdle
,
or
by
Mr
Merdle
on
Lord
Decimus
,
and
his
services
might
at
any
moment
be
required
as
Dresser
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Lord
Decimus
called
to
him
"
Ferdinand
!
"
and
he
went
,
and
took
his
place
in
the
conference
for
some
five
minutes
more
.
 
<EOS>
Then
a
half
-
suppressed
gasp
broke
out
among
the
Chorus
;
for
Lord
Decimus
rose
to
take
his
leave
.
 
<EOS>
Again
coached
up
by
Ferdinand
to
the
point
of
making
himself
popular
,
he
shook
hands
in
the
most
brilliant
manner
with
the
whole
company
,
and
even
said
to
Bar
,
"
I
hope
you
were
not
bored
by
my
pears
?
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
Bar
retorted
,
"
Eton
,
my
lord
,
or
Parliamentary
?
"
<EOS>
neatly
showing
that
he
had
mastered
the
joke
,
and
delicately
insinuating
that
he
could
never
forget
it
while
his
life
remained
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
grave
importance
that
was
buttoned
up
in
Mr
Tite
Barnacle
,
took
itself
away
next
;
and
Ferdinand
took
himself
away
next
,
to
the
opera
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
rest
lingered
a
little
,
marrying
golden
liqueur
glasses
to
Buhl
tables
with
sticky
rings
;
on
the
desperate
chance
of
Mr
Merdle
's
saying
something
.
 
<EOS>
But
Merdle
,
as
usual
,
oozed
sluggishly
and
muddily
about
his
drawing
-
room
,
saying
never
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
day
or
two
it
was
announced
to
all
the
town
,
that
Edmund
Sparkler
,
Esquire
,
son
-
in
-
law
of
the
eminent
Mr
Merdle
of
worldwide
renown
,
was
made
one
of
the
Lords
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
;
and
proclamation
was
issued
,
to
all
true
believers
,
that
this
admirable
appointment
was
to
be
hailed
as
a
graceful
and
gracious
mark
of
homage
,
rendered
by
the
graceful
and
gracious
Decimus
,
to
that
commercial
interest
which
must
ever
in
a
great
commercial
country
---
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
with
blast
of
trumpet
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
bolstered
by
this
mark
of
Government
homage
,
the
wonderful
Bank
and
all
the
other
wonderful
undertakings
went
on
and
went
up
;
and
gapers
came
to
Harley
Street
,
Cavendish
Square
,
only
to
look
at
the
house
where
the
golden
wonder
lived
.
   
<EOS>
And
when
they
saw
the
Chief
Butler
looking
out
at
the
hall
-
door
in
his
moments
of
condescension
,
the
gapers
said
how
rich
he
looked
,
and
wondered
how
much
money
he
had
in
the
wonderful
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
they
had
known
that
respectable
Nemesis
better
,
they
would
not
have
wondered
about
it
,
and
might
have
stated
the
amount
with
the
utmost
precision
.

The
Progress

an
Epidemic
 
That
it
is
at

as
difficult
to
stay
a
moral
infection
as
a
physical
one
;
that
such
a
disease
will
spread
with
the
malignity

the
Plague

that
the
contagion

spare

but
will
lay
hold

become

is
a
fact

firmly
established

as
that

breathe

A

conferred

in

these

As

so
the
sacred
flame
which
the
mighty
Barnacles
had
fanned
caused
the
air
to
resound
more
and
more
with
the
name
of
Merdle

<EOS>
It
was
deposited

Nobody

Down

at

<EOS>
Mr
Plornish
,
who
had
a
small

said

trowel

people
did

put

which
all

looked

bring

<EOS>
Mr

sole

of
Mr

was
reputed
in
whispers
to
lay
by
the
savings
which
were
the
result
of
his
simple

moderate
life

for
investment
in
one
of
Mr

certain

<EOS>
The
female
Bleeding
Hearts
,
when
they
came
for
ounces
of
tea
,
and
hundredweights
of
talk
,
gave
Mrs
Plornish
to
understand
,
That
how
,
ma'am
,
they
had
heard
from
their
cousin
Mary
Anne
,
which
worked
in
the
line
,
that
his
lady
's
dresses
would
fill
three
waggons
.
 
<EOS>
That
how
she
was
as
handsome
a
lady
,
ma'am
,
as
lived
,
no
matter
where
s
,
and
a
busk
like
marble
itself
.
 
<EOS>
That
how
,
according
to
what
they
was
told
,
ma'am
,
it
was
her
son
by
a
former
husband
as
was
took
into
the
Government
;
and
a
General
he
had
been
,
and
armies
he
had
marched
again
and
victory
crowned
,
if
all
you
heard
was
to
be
believed
.
 
<EOS>
That
how
it
was
reported
that
Mr
Merdle
's
words
had
been
,
that
if
they
could
have
made
it
worth
his
while
to
take
the
whole
Government
he
would
have
took
it
without
a
profit
,
but
that
take
it
he
could
not
and
stand
a
loss
.
 
<EOS>
That
how
it
was
not
to
be
expected
,
ma'am
,
that
he
should
lose
by
it
,
his
ways
being
,
as
you
might
say
and
utter
no
falsehood
,
paved
with
gold
;
but
that
how
it
was
much
to
be
regretted
that
something
handsome
had
n't
been
got
up
to
make
it
worth
his
while
;
for
it
was
such
and
only
such
that
knowed
the
heighth
to
which
the
bread
and
butchers
'
meat
had
rose
,
and
it
was
such
and
only
such
<EOS>
that
both
could
and

bring
that
heighth
down
.

So
rife
and
potent
was
the
fever
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
that
Mr
Pancks

rent
-
days
caused
no
interval
in
the
patients

The

took
the
singular

of
causing
the
infected
to
find
an

consolation

reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
the
truth
,
sir
,
when
I
say
I
have
n't
got
so
much
as
a
single
sixpence
of
it
to
bless
myself
with
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
,
"
Mr
Pancks
would
retort
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
expect
it
will
do
;
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
Defaulter
would
admit
,
with
a
low
-
spirited
"
No
,
sir
,
"
having
no
such
expectation
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
proprietor
is
n't
going
to
stand
this
,
you
know
,
"
Mr
Pancks
would
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
send
me
here
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
Pay
up
!
 
<EOS>
Come
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Defaulter
would
make
answer
,
"
Ah
,
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
the
rich
gentleman
whose
name
is
in
everybody
's
mouth
---
if
my
name
was
Merdle
,
sir
---
I
'd
soon
pay
up
,
and
be
glad
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dialogues
on
the
rent
-
question
usually
took
place
at
the
house
-
doors
or
in
the
entries
,
and
in
the
presence
of
several
deeply
interested
Bleeding
Hearts
.
 
<EOS>
They
always
received
a
reference
of
this
kind
with
a
low
murmur
of
response
,
as
if
it
were
convincing
;
and
the
Defaulter
,
however
black
and
discomfited
before
,
always
cheered
up
a
little
in
making
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
Mr
Merdle
,
sir
,
you
would
n't
have
cause
to
complain
of
me
then
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
believe
me
!
"
<EOS>
the
Defaulter
would
proceed
with
a
shake
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
pay
up
so
quick
then
,
Mr
Pancks
,
that
you
should
n't
have
to
ask
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
response
would
be
heard
again
here
,
implying
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
anything
fairer
,
and
that
this
was
the
next
thing
to
paying
the
money
down
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
would
be
now
reduced
to
saying
as
he
booked
the
case
,
"
Well
!
 
<EOS>
You
'll
have
the
broker
in
,
and
be
turned
out
;
that
's
what
'll
happen
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
talking
to
me
about
Mr
Merdle
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
Mr
Merdle
,
any
more
than
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
the
Defaulter
would
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
you
were
him
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
response
would
take
this
up
quickly
;
replying
with
great
feeling
,
"
Only
wish
you
were
him
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
be
easier
with
us
<EOS>
if
you
were
Mr
Merdle
,
sir
,
"
the
Defaulter
would
go
on
with
rising
spirits
,
"
and
it
would
be
better
for
all
parties
.
 
<EOS>
Better
for
our
sakes
,
and
better
for
yours
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
have
to
worry
no
one
,
then
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
have
to
worry
us
,
and
you
would
n't
have
to
worry
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
be
easier
in
your
own
mind
,
sir
,
and
you
'd
leave
others
easier
,
too
<EOS>
,
you
would
,
if
you
were
Mr
Merdle
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
in
whom
these
impersonal
compliments
produced
an
irresistible
sheepishness
,
never
rallied
after
such
a
charge
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
only
bite
his
nails
and
puff
away
to
the
next
Defaulter
.
 
<EOS>
The
responsive
Bleeding
Hearts
would
then
gather
round
the
Defaulter
whom
he
had
just
abandoned
,
and
the
most
extravagant
rumours
would
circulate
among
them
,
to
their
great
comfort
,
touching
the
amount
of
Mr
Merdle
's
ready
money
.
   
<EOS>
From
one
of
the
many
such
defeats
of
one
of
many
rent
-
days
,
Mr
Pancks
,
having
finished
his
day
's
collection
,
repaired
with
his
note
-
book
under
his
arm
to
Mrs
Plornish
's
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
's
object
was
not
professional
,
but
social
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
a
trying
day
,
and
wanted
a
little
brightening
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
he
was
on
friendly
terms
with
the
Plornish
family
,
having
often
looked
in
upon
them
at
similar
seasons
,
and
borne
his
part
in
recollections
of
Miss
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
's
shop
-
parlour
had
been
decorated
under
her
own
eye
,
and
presented
,
on
the
side
towards
the
shop
,
a
little
fiction
in
which
Mrs
Plornish
unspeakably
rejoiced
.
 
<EOS>
This
poetical
heightening
of
the
parlour
consisted
in
the
wall
being
painted
to
represent
the
exterior
of
a
thatched
cottage
;
the
artist
having
introduced
(
in
as
effective
a
manner
as
he
found
compatible
with
their
highly
disproportionate
dimensions
)
<EOS>
the
real
door
and
window
.
 
<EOS>
The
modest
sunflower
and
hollyhock
were
depicted
as
flourishing
with
great
luxuriance
on
this
rustic
dwelling
,
while
a
quantity
of
dense
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimney
indicated
good
cheer
within
,
and
also
,
perhaps
,
that
it
had
not
been
lately
swept
.
 
<EOS>
A
faithful
dog
was
represented
as
flying
at
the
legs
of
the
friendly
visitor
,
from
the
threshold
;
and
a
circular
pigeon
-
house
,
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
pigeons
,
arose
from
behind
the
garden
-
paling
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
door
(
when
it
was
shut
)
,
appeared
the
semblance
of
a
brass
-
plate
,
presenting
the
inscription
,
Happy
Cottage
,
T
and
M
Plornish
;
<EOS>
the
partnership
expressing
man
and
wife
.
 
<EOS>
No
Poetry
and
no
Art
ever
charmed
the
imagination
more
than
the
union
of
the
two
in
this
counterfeit
cottage
charmed
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
to
her
that
Plornish
had
a
habit
of
leaning
against
it
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
after
work
,
when
his
hat
blotted
out
the
pigeon
-
house
and
all
the
pigeons
,
when
his
back
swallowed
up
the
dwelling
,
when
his
hands
in
his
pockets
uprooted
the
blooming
garden
and
laid
waste
the
adjacent
country
.
<EOS>
To
Mrs
Plornish
,
it
was
still
a
most
beautiful
cottage
,
a
most
wonderful
deception
;
and
it
made
no
difference
that
Mr
Plornish
's
eye
was
some
inches
above
the
level
of
the
gable
bed
-
room
in
the
thatch
.
 
<EOS>
To
come
out
into
the
shop
after
it
was
shut
,
and
hear
her
father
sing
a
song
inside
this
cottage
,
was
a
perfect
Pastoral
to
Mrs
Plornish
,
the
Golden
Age
revived
.
 
<EOS>
And
truly
if
that
famous
period
had
been
revived
,
or
had
ever
been
at
all
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
doubted
whether
it
would
have
produced
many
more
heartily
admiring
daughters
than
the
poor
woman
.
   
<EOS>
Warned
of
a
visitor
by
the
tinkling
bell
at
the
shop
-
door
,
Mrs
Plornish
came
out
of
Happy
Cottage
to
see
who
it
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
guessed
it
was
you
,
Mr
Pancks
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
for
it
's
quite
your
regular
night
;
ai
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
Here
's
father
,
you
see
,
come
out
to
serve
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
,
like
a
brisk
young
shopman
.
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
he
looking
well
?
 
<EOS>
Father
's
more
pleased
to
see
you
than
if
you
was
a
customer
<EOS>
,
for
he
dearly
loves
a
gossip
;
and
when
it
turns
upon
Miss
Dorrit
,
he
loves
it
all
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
heard
father
in
such
voice
as
he
is
at
present
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
her
own
voice
quavering
,
she
was
so
proud
and
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
gave
us
Strephon
last
night
to
that
degree
that
Plornish
gets
up
and
makes
him
this
speech
across
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
John
Edward
Nandy
,
"
says
Plornish
to
father
,
"
I
never
heard
you
come
the
warbles
as
I
have
heard
you
come
the
warbles
this
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
An't
it
gratifying
,
Mr
Pancks
,
though
;
really
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
who
had
snorted
at
the
old
man
in
his
friendliest
manner
,
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
casually
asked
whether
that
lively
Altro
chap
had
come
in
yet
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
answered
no
,
not
yet
,
though
he
had
gone
to
the
West
-
End
with
some
work
,
and
had
said
he
should
be
back
by
tea
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
was
then
hospitably
pressed
into
Happy
Cottage
,
where
he
encountered
the
elder
Master
Plornish
just
come
home
from
school
.
 
<EOS>
Examining
that
young
student
,
lightly
,
on
the
educational
proceedings
of
the
day
,
he
found
that
the
more
advanced
pupils
who
were
in
the
large
text
and
the
letter
M
,
had
been
set
the
copy
"
Merdle
,
Millions
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
how
are
you
getting
on
,
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
since
we
're
mentioning
millions
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Very
steady
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Father
,
dear
,
would
you
go
into
the
shop
and
tidy
the
window
a
little
bit
before
tea
,
your
taste
being
so
beautiful
?
"
   
<EOS>
John
Edward
Nandy
trotted
away
,
much
gratified
,
to
comply
with
his
daughter
's
request
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
,
who
was
always
in
mortal
terror
of
mentioning
pecuniary
affairs
before
the
old
gentleman
,
lest
any
disclosure
she
made
might
rouse
his
spirit
and
induce
him
to
run
away
to
the
workhouse
,
was
thus
left
free
to
be
confidential
with
Mr
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
true
that
the
business
is
very
steady
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
lowering
her
voice
;
"
and
has
a
excellent
connection
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
thing
that
stands
in
its
way
,
sir
,
is
the
Credit
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
drawback
,
rather
severely
felt
by
most
people
who
engaged
in
commercial
transactions
with
the
inhabitants
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
was
a
large
stumbling
-
block
in
Mrs
Plornish
's
trade
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Dorrit
had
established
her
in
the
business
,
the
Bleeding
Hearts
had
shown
an
amount
of
emotion
and
a
determination
to
support
her
in
it
,
that
did
honour
to
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Recognising
her
claim
upon
their
generous
feelings
as
one
who
had
long
been
a
member
of
their
community
,
they
pledged
themselves
,
with
great
feeling
,
<EOS>
to
deal
with
Mrs
Plornish
,
come
what
would
and
bestow
their
patronage
on
no
other
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
Influenced
by
these
noble
sentiments
,
they
had
even
gone
out
of
their
way
to
purchase
little
luxuries
in
the
grocery
and
butter
line
to
which
they
were
unaccustomed
;
saying
to
one
another
,
that
if
they
did
stretch
a
point
,
was
it
not
for
a
neighbour
and
a
friend
,
and
for
whom
ought
a
point
to
be
stretched
if
not
for
such
?
 
<EOS>
So
stimulated
,
the
business
was
extremely
brisk
,
and
the
articles
in
stock
went
off
with
the
greatest
celerity
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
if
the
Bleeding
Hearts
had
but
paid
,
the
undertaking
would
have
been
a
complete
success
;
whereas
,
by
reason
of
their
exclusively
confining
themselves
to
owing
,
the
profits
actually
realised
had
not
yet
begun
to
appear
in
the
books
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
was
making
a
very
porcupine
of
himself
by
sticking
his
hair
up
in
the
contemplation
of
this
state
of
accounts
,
when
old
Mr
Nandy
,
re
-
entering
the
cottage
with
an
air
of
mystery
,
entreated
them
to
come
and
look
at
the
strange
behaviour
of
Mr
Baptist
,
who
seemed
to
have
met
with
something
that
had
scared
him
.
 
<EOS>
All
three
going
into
the
shop
,
and
watching
through
the
window
,
then
saw
Mr
Baptist
,
pale
and
agitated
,
go
through
the
following
extraordinary
performances
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
he
was
observed
hiding
at
the
top
of
the
steps
leading
down
into
the
Yard
,
and
peeping
up
and
down
the
street
with
his
head
cautiously
thrust
out
close
to
the
side
of
the
shop
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
After
very
anxious
scrutiny
,
he
came
out
of
his
retreat
,
and
went
briskly
down
the
street
as
if
he
were
going
away
altogether
;
then
,
suddenly
turned
about
,
and
went
,
at
the
same
pace
,
and
with
the
same
feint
,
up
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gone
no
further
up
the
street
than
he
had
gone
down
,
when
he
crossed
the
road
and
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
object
of
this
last
manoeuvre
was
only
apparent
,
when
his
entering
the
shop
with
a
sudden
twist
,
from
the
steps
again
,
explained
that
he
had
made
a
wide
and
obscure
circuit
round
to
the
other
,
or
Doyce
and
Clennam
,
end
of
the
Yard
,
and
had
come
through
the
Yard
and
bolted
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
out
of
breath
by
that
time
,
as
he
might
well
be
,
and
his
heart
seemed
to
jerk
faster
than
the
little
shop
-
bell
,
as
it
quivered
and
jingled
behind
him
with
his
hasty
shutting
of
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
,
old
chap
!
"
said
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Altro
,
old
boy
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
,
or
Signor
Cavalletto
,
understood
English
now
almost
as
well
as
Mr
Pancks
himself
,
and
could
speak
it
very
well
too
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Mrs
Plornish
,
with
a
pardonable
vanity
in
that
accomplishment
of
hers
which
made
her
all
but
Italian
,
stepped
in
as
interpreter
.
   
<EOS>
"
E
ask
know
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
<EOS>
What
go
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
into
the
happy
little
cottage
,
Padrona
,
"
returned
Mr
Baptist
,
imparting
great
stealthiness
to
his
flurried
back
-
handed
shake
of
his
right
forefinger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
was
proud
of
the
title
Padrona
,
which
she
regarded
as
signifying
:
not
so
much
Mistress
of
the
house
,
as
Mistress
of
the
Italian
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
She
immediately
complied
with
Mr
Baptist
's
request
,
and
they
all
went
into
the
cottage
.
   
<EOS>
"
E
ope
you
<EOS>
no
fright
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
then
,
interpreting
Mr
Pancks
in
a
new
way
with
her
usual
fertility
of
resource
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
appen
?
 
<EOS>
Peaka
Padrona
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen

returned
Baptist
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
rincontrato
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
m
?
 
<EOS>
Oo
him
?
"
asked
Mrs
Plornish
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
bad
man
.
 
<EOS>
A
baddest
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hoped
that
I
should
never
see
him
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
Ow
you
know
him
bad
?
"
asked
Mrs
Plornish
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
matter
,
Padrona
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
too
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
'
E
see
you
?
"
asked
Mrs
Plornish
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
not
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
says
,
"
Mrs
Plornish
then
interpreted
,
addressing
her
father
and
Pancks
with
mild
condescension
,
"
that
he
has
met
a
bad
man
,
but
he
hopes
the
bad
man
did
n't
see
him
---
Why
,
"
inquired
Mrs
Plornish
,
reverting
to
the
Italian
language
,
"
why
ope
bad
man
no
see
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Padrona
,
dearest
,
"
returned
the
little
foreigner
whom
she
so
considerately
protected
,
"
do
not
ask
,
I
pray
.
 
<EOS>
Once
again
I
say
it
matters
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
fear
of
this
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to
see
him
,
I
do
not
wish
to
be
known
of
him
---
never
again
!
 
<EOS>
Enough
,
most
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
topic
was
so
disagreeable
to
him
,
and
so
put
his
usual
liveliness
to
the
rout
,
that
Mrs
Plornish
forbore
to
press
him
further
:
<EOS>
the
rather
as
the
tea
had
been
drawing
for
some
time
on
the
hob
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
the
less
surprised
and
curious
for
asking
no
more
questions
;
neither
was
Mr
Pancks
,
whose
expressive
breathing
had
been
labouring
hard
since
the
entrance
of
the
little
man
,
like
a
locomotive
engine
with
a
great
load
getting
up
a
steep
incline
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
,
now
better
dressed
than
of
yore
,
though
still
faithful
to
the
monstrous
character
of
her
cap
,
had
been
in
the
background
from
the
first
with
open
mouth
and
eyes
,
which
staring
and
gaping
features
were
not
diminished
in
breadth
by
the
untimely
suppression
of
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
no
more
was
said
about
it
,
though
much
appeared
to
be
thought
on
all
sides
:
by
no
means
excepting
the
two
young
Plornishes
,
who
partook
of
the
evening
meal
as
if
their
eating
the
bread
and
butter
were
rendered
almost
superfluous
by
the
painful
probability
of
the
worst
of
men
shortly
presenting
himself
for
the
purpose
of
eating
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
,
by
degrees
began
to
chirp
a
little
;
but
never
stirred
from
the
seat
he
had
taken
behind
the
door
and
close
to
the
window
,
though
it
was
not
his
usual
place
.
 
<EOS>
As
often
as
the
little
bell
rang
,
he
started
and
peeped
out
secretly
,
with
the
end
of
the
little
curtain
in
his
hand
and
the
rest
before
his
face
;
evidently
not
at
all
satisfied
but
that
the
man
he
dreaded
had
tracked
him
through
all
his
doublings
and
turnings
,
with
the
certainty
of
a
terrible
bloodhound
.
   
<EOS>
The
entrance
,
at
various
times
,
of
two
or
three
customers
and
of
Mr
Plornish
,
gave
Mr
Baptist
just
enough
of
this
employment
to
keep
the
attention
of
the
company
fixed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
was
over
,
and
the
children
were
abed
,
and
Mrs
Plornish
was
feeling
her
way
to
the
dutiful
proposal
that
her
father
should
favour
them
with
Chloe
,
when
the
bell
rang
again
,
and
Mr
Clennam
came
in
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
had
been
poring
late
over
his
books
and
letters
;
for
the
waiting
-
rooms
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
ravaged
his
time
sorely
.
   
<EOS>
Over
and
above
that
,
he
was
depressed
and
made
uneasy
by
the
late
occurrence
at
his
mother
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
worn
and
solitary
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
so
,
too
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
was
returning
home
from
his
counting
-
house
by
that
end
of
the
Yard
to
give
them
the
intelligence
that
he
had
received
another
letter
from
Miss
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
The
news
made
a
sensation
in
the
cottage
which
drew
off
the
general
attention
from
Mr
Baptist
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
,
who
pushed
her
way
into
the
foreground
immediately
,
would
have
seemed
to
draw
in
the
tidings
of
her
Little
Mother
equally
at
her
ears
,
nose
,
mouth
,
and
eyes
,
but
that
the
last
were
obstructed
by
tears
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
particularly
delighted
when
Clennam
assured
her
that
there
were
hospitals
,
and
very
kindly
conducted
hospitals
,
in
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
rose
into
new
distinction
in
virtue
of
being
specially
remembered
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Everybody
was
pleased
and
interested
,
and
Clennam
was
well
repaid
for
his
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
tired
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
make
you
a
cup
of
tea
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
if
you
'd
condescend
to
take
such
a
thing
in
the
cottage
;
and
many
thanks
to
you
,
too
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
for
bearing
us
in
mind
so
kindly
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Plornish
deeming
it
incumbent
on
him
,
as
host
,
to
add
his
personal
acknowledgments
,
tendered
them
in
the
form
which
always
expressed
his
highest
ideal
of
a
combination
of
ceremony
with
sincerity
.
   
<EOS>
"
John
Edward
Nandy
,
"
said
Mr
Plornish
,
addressing
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
too
often
that
you
see
unpretending
actions
without
a
spark
of
pride
,
and
therefore
when
you
see
them
give
grateful
honour
unto
the
same
,
being
that
if
you
do
n't
,
and
live
to
want
'em
<EOS>
,
it
follows
serve
you
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
which
Mr
Nandy
replied
:
   
"
I
am
heartily
of
your
opinion
,
Thomas
,
and
which
<EOS>
your
opinion
is
the
same
as
mine
,
and
therefore
no
more
words
and
not
being
backwards
with
that
opinion
,
which
opinion
giving
it
as
yes
,
Thomas
,
yes
,
is
the
opinion
in
which
yourself
and
me
must
ever
be
unanimously
jined
by
all
,
and
where
there
is
not
difference
of
opinion
<EOS>
there
can
be
none
but
one
opinion
,
which
fully
no
,
Thomas
,
Thomas
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
,
with
less
formality
,
expressed
himself
gratified
by
their
high
appreciation
of
so
very
slight
an
attention
on
his
part
;
and
explained
as
to
the
tea
that
he
had
not
yet
dined
,
and
was
going
straight
home
to
refresh
after
a
long
day
's
labour
,
or
he
would
have
readily
accepted
the
hospitable
offer
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pancks
was
somewhat
noisily
getting
his
steam
up
for
departure
,
he
concluded
by
asking
that
gentleman
if
he
would
walk
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
said
he
desired
no
better
engagement
,
and
the
two
took
leave
of
Happy
Cottage
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
come
home
with
me
,
Pancks
,
"
said
Arthur
,
when
they
got
into
the
street
,
"
and
will
share
what
dinner
or
supper
there
is
,
it
will
be
next
door
to
an
act
of
charity
;
for
I
am
weary
and
out
of
sorts
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
me
to
do
a
greater
thing
than
that
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
when
you
want
it
done
,
and
I
'll
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Between
this
eccentric
personage
and
Clennam
,
a
tacit
understanding
and
accord
had
been
always
improving
since
Mr
Pancks
flew
over
Mr
Rugg
's
back
in
the
Marshalsea
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
carriage
drove
away
on
the
memorable
day
of
the
family
's
departure
,
these
two
had
looked
after
it
together
,
and
had
walked
slowly
away
together
.
<EOS>
When
the
first
letter
came
from
little
Dorrit
,
nobody
was
more
interested
in
hearing
of
her
than
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
letter
,
at
that
moment
in
Clennam
's
breast
-
pocket
,
particularly
remembered
him
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
Though
he
had
never
before
made
any
profession
or
protestation
to
Clennam
,
and
though
what
he
had
just
said
was
little
enough
as
to
the
words
in
which
it
was
expressed
,
Clennam
had
long
had
a
growing
belief
that
Mr
Pancks
,
in
his
own
odd
way
,
was
becoming
attached
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
strings
intertwining
made
Pancks
a
very
cable
of
anchorage
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
alone
,
"
Arthur
explained
as
they
walked
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
partner
is
away
,
busily
engaged
at
a
distance
on
his
branch
of
our
business
,
and
you
shall
do
just
as
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
n't
take
particular
notice
of
little
Altro
just
now
;
did
you
?
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
bright
fellow
,
and
I
like
him
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Something
has
gone
amiss
with
him
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
any
idea
of
any
cause
that
can
have
overset
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
!
 
<EOS>
None
<EOS>
whatever
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
gave
his
reasons
for
the
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
was
quite
unprepared
for
them
,
and
quite
unable
to
suggest
an
explanation
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
'll
ask
him
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
as
he
's
a
stranger
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
him
what
?
"
returned
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
he
has
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ought
first
to
see
for
myself
that
he
has
something
on
his
mind
,
I
think
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
him
in
every
way
<EOS>
so
diligent
,
so
grateful
(
for
little
enough
)
,
and
so
trustworthy
,
that
it
might
look
like
suspecting
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
would
be
very
unjust
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
You
ought
n't
to
be
anybody
's
proprietor
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
much
too
delicate
.
"
<EOS>
"
For
the
matter
of
that
,
"
returned
Clennam
laughing
,
"
I
have
not
a
large
proprietary
share
in
Cavalletto
.
 
<EOS>
His
carving
is
his
livelihood
.
 
<EOS>
He
keeps
the
keys
of
the
Factory
,
watches
it
every
alternate
night
,
and
acts
as
a
sort
of
housekeeper
to
it
generally
;
but
we
have
little
work
in
the
way
of
his
ingenuity
,
though
we
give
him
what
we
have
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
rather
his
adviser
than
his
proprietor
.
 
<EOS>
To
call
me
his
standing
counsel
and
his
banker
would
be
nearer
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Speaking
of
being
his
banker
,
is
it
not
curious
,
Pancks
,
that
the
ventures
which
run
just
now
in
so
many
people
's
heads
,
should
run
even
in
little
Cavalletto
's
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ventures
?
"
retorted
Pancks
,
with
a
snort
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
ventures
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
These
Merdle
enterprises
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
Investments
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
you
were
speaking
of
investments
.
<EOS>
"
His
quick
way
of
replying
caused
Clennam
to
look
at
him
,
with
a
doubt
whether
he
meant
more
than
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
accompanied
,
however
,
with
a
quickening
of
his
pace
and
a
corresponding
increase
in
the
labouring
of
his
machinery
,
Arthur
did
not
pursue
the
matter
,
and
they
soon
arrived
at
his
house
.
   
<EOS>
A
dinner
of
soup
and
a
pigeon
-
pie
,
served
on
a
little
round
table
before
the
fire
,
and
flavoured
with
a
bottle
of
good
wine
,
oiled
Mr
Pancks
's
works
in
a
highly
effective
manner
;
so
that
when
Clennam
produced
his
Eastern
pipe
,
and
handed
Mr
Pancks
another
Eastern
pipe
,
the
latter
gentleman
was
perfectly
comfortable
.
   
<EOS>
They
puffed
for
a
while
in
silence
,
Mr
Pancks
like
a
steam
-
vessel
with
wind
,
tide
,
calm
water
,
and
all
other
sea
-
going
conditions
in
her
favour
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
first
to
speak
,
and
he
spoke
thus
:
   
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Investments
is
the
word
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
,
with
his
former
look
,
said
"
Ah
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
back
to
it
,
you
see
,
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
are
going
back
to
it
,
"
returned
Clennam
,
wondering
why
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
it
a
curious
thing
that
they
should
run
in
little
Altro
's
head
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
said
Pancks
as
he
smoked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
that
how
you
put
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
 
<EOS>
But
think
of
the
whole
Yard
having
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
their
all
meeting
me
with
it
,
on
my
collecting
days
,
here
and
there
and
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
they
pay
,
or
whether
they
do
n't
pay
.
 
<EOS>
Merdle
,
Merdle
,
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
Always
Merdle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
strange
how
these
runs
on
an
infatuation
prevail
,
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
An't
it
?
"
<EOS>
returned
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
After
smoking
for
a
minute
or
so
,
more
drily
than
comported
with
his
recent
oiling
,
he
added
:
"
Because
you
see
these
people
do
n't
understand
the
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
,
"
assented
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
,
"
cried
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Know
nothing
of
figures
.
 
<EOS>
Know
nothing
of
money
questions
.
 
<EOS>
Never
made
a
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
Never
worked
it
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
they
had
---
"
Clennam
was
going
on
to
say
;
when
Mr
Pancks
,
without
change
of
countenance
,
produced
a
sound
so
far
surpassing
all
his
usual
efforts
,
nasal
or
bronchial
,
that
he
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
they
had
?
"
repeated
Pancks
in
an
inquiring
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
---
spoke
,
"
said
Arthur
,
hesitating
what
name
to
give
the
interruption
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
had
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
they
had
,
"
observed
Clennam
,
who
was
a
little
at
a
loss
how
to
take
his
friend
,
"
why
,
I
suppose
they
would
have
known
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
so
,
Mr
Clennam
?
<EOS>
"
Pancks
asked
quickly
,
and
with
an
odd
effect
of
having
been
from
the
commencement
of
the
conversation
loaded
with
the
heavy
charge
he
now
fired
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
're
right
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
They
do
n't
mean
to
be
,
but
they
're
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Right
in
sharing
Cavalletto
's
inclination
to
speculate
with
Mr
Merdle
?
"
   
"
Per
-
fectly
,
sir
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
gone
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
made
the
calculations
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
worked
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
safe
and
genuine
.
"
<EOS>
Relieved
by
having
got
to
this
,
Mr
Pancks
took
as
long
a
pull
as
his
lungs
would
permit
at
his
Eastern
pipe
,
and
looked
sagaciously
and
steadily
at
Clennam
while
inhaling
and
exhaling
too
.
   
<EOS>
In
those
moments
,
Mr
Pancks
began
to
give
out
the
dangerous
infection
with
which
he
was
laden
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
manner
of
communicating
these
diseases
;
it
is
the
subtle
way
in
which
they
go
about
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
,
my
good
Pancks
,
"
asked
Clennam
emphatically
,
"
that
you
would
put
that
thousand
pounds
of
yours
,
let
us
say
,
for
instance
,
out
at
this
kind
of
interest
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Already
done
it
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
took
another
long
inhalation
,
another
long
exhalation
,
another
long
sagacious
look
at
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Mr
Clennam
,
I
've
gone
into
it
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
man
of
immense
resources
---
enormous
capital
---
government
influence
.
<EOS>
They
're
the
best
schemes
afloat
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
safe
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
certain
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
returned
Clennam
,
looking
first
at
him
gravely
and
then
at
the
fire
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
Pancks
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
what
you
ought
to
do
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
do
as
I
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
Of
whom
Mr
Pancks
had
taken
the
prevalent
disease
,
he
could
no
more
have
told
than
if
he
had
unconsciously
taken
a
fever
.
 
<EOS>
Bred
at
first
,
as
many
physical
diseases
are
,
in
the
wickedness
of
men
,
and
then
disseminated
in
their
ignorance
,
these
epidemics
,
after
a
period
,
get
communicated
to
many
sufferers
who
are
neither
ignorant
nor
wicked
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
might
,
or
might
not
,
have
caught
the
illness
himself
from
a
subject
of
this
class
;
but
in
this
category
he
appeared
before
Clennam
,
and
the
infection
he
threw
off
was
all
the
more
virulent
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
have
really
invested
,
"
Clennam
had
already
passed
to
that
word
,
"
your
thousand
pounds
,
Pancks
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
sir
!
"
replied
Pancks
boldly
,
with
a
puff
of
smoke
.
"
<EOS>
And
only
wish
it
ten
!
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Clennam
had
two
subjects
lying
heavy
on
his
lonely
mind
that
night
;
the
one
,
his
partner
's
long
-
deferred
hope
;
the
other
,
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
at
his
mother
's
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
relief
of
having
this
companion
,
and
of
feeling
that
he
could
trust
him
,
he
passed
on
to
both
,
and
both
brought
him
round
again
,
with
an
increase
and
acceleration
of
force
,
to
his
point
of
departure
.
   
<EOS>
It
came
about
in
the
simplest
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Quitting
the
investment
subject
,
after
an
interval
of
silent
looking
at
the
fire
through
the
smoke
of
his
pipe
,
he
told
Pancks
how
and
why
he
was
occupied
with
the
great
National
Department
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
hard
case
it
has
been
,
and
a
hard
case
it
is
on
Doyce
,
"
he
finished
by
saying
,
with
all
the
honest
feeling
the
topic
roused
in
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hard
indeed
,
"
Pancks
acquiesced
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
manage
for
him
,
Mr
Clennam
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Manage
the
money
part
of
the
business
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
As
well
as
I
can
.
"
   
"
Manage
it
better
,
sir
,
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Recompense
him
for
his
toils
and
disappointments
.
 
<EOS>
Give
him
the
chances
of
the
time
.
<EOS>
He
'll
never
benefit
himself
in
that
way
,
patient
and
preoccupied
workman
.
 
<EOS>
He
looks
to
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
my
best
,
Pancks
,
"
returned
Clennam
,
uneasily
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
to
duly
weighing
and
considering
these
new
enterprises
of
which
I
have
had
no
experience
,
I
doubt
if
I
am
fit
for
it
,
I
am
growing
old
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Growing
old
?
"
cried
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
!
"
   
There
was
something
so
indubitably
genuine
in
the
wonderful
laugh
,
and
series
of
snorts
and
puffs
,
engendered
in
Mr
Pancks
's
astonishment
at
,
and
utter
rejection
of
,
the
idea
,
that
his
being
quite
in
earnest
could
not
be
questioned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Growing
old
?
"
cried
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
,
hear
!
 
<EOS>
Old
?
 
<EOS>
Hear
him
,
hear
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
positive
refusal
expressed
in
Mr
Pancks
's
continued
snorts
,
no
less
than
in
these
exclamations
,
to
entertain
the
sentiment
for
a
single
instant
,
drove
Arthur
away
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
was
fearful
of
something
happening
to
Mr
Pancks
in
the
violent
conflict
that
took
place
between
the
breath
he
jerked
out
of
himself
and
the
smoke
he
jerked
into
himself
.
 
<EOS>
This
abandonment
of
the
second
topic
threw
him
on
the
third
.
   
<EOS>
"
Young
,
old
,
or
middle
-
aged
,
Pancks
,
"
he
said
,
when
there
was
a
favourable
pause
,
"
I
am
in
a
very
anxious
and
uncertain
state
;
a
state
that
even
leads
me
to
doubt
whether
anything
now
seeming
to
belong
to
me
,
may
be
really
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
how
this
is
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
put
a
great
trust
in
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
,
sir
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
if
you
believe
me
worthy
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
's
short
and
sharp
rejoinder
,
confirmed
by
the
sudden
outstretching
of
his
coaly
hand
,
was
most
expressive
and
convincing
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
shook
the
hand
warmly
.
   
<EOS>
He
then
,
softening
the
nature
of
his
old
apprehensions
as
much
as
was
possible
consistently
with
their
being
made
intelligible
and
never
alluding
to
his
mother
by
name
,
but
speaking
vaguely
of
a
relation
of
his
,
confided
to
Mr
Pancks
a
broad
outline
of
the
misgivings
he
entertained
,
and
of
the
interview
he
had
witnessed
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
listened
with
such
interest
that
,
regardless
of
the
charms
of
the
Eastern
pipe
,
he
put
it
in
the
grate
among
the
fire
-
irons
,
and
occupied
his
hands
during
the
whole
recital
in
so
erecting
the
loops
and
hooks
of
hair
all
over
his
head
,
that
he
looked
,
when
it
came
to
a
conclusion
,
like
a
journeyman
Hamlet
in
conversation
with
his
father
's
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brings
me
back
,
sir
,
"
was
his
exclamation
then
,
with
a
startling
touch
on
Clennam
's
knee
,
"
brings
me
back
,
sir
,
to
the
Investments
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
anything
of
your
making
yourself
poor
to
repair
a
wrong
you
never
committed
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
you
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
must
be
himself
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
say
this
,
fearing
you
may
want
money
to
save
your
own
blood
from
exposure
and
disgrace
---
make
as
much
as
you
can
!
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
shook
his
head
,
but
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
as
rich
as
you
can
,
sir
,
"
Pancks
adjured
him
with
a
powerful
concentration
of
all
his
energies
on
the
advice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
as
rich
as
you
honestly
can
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
your
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Not
for
your
sake
,
but
for
the
sake
of
others
.
 
<EOS>
Take
time
by
the
forelock
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Doyce
(
who
really
is
growing
old
)
depends
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
Your
relative
depends
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
what
depends
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
well
!
"
returned
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
word
more
,
Mr
Clennam
,
"
retorted
Pancks
,
"
and
then
enough
for
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
you
leave
all
the
gains
to
the
gluttons
,
knaves
,
and
impostors
?
 
<EOS>
Why
should
you
leave
all
the
gains
that
are
to
be
got
to
my
proprietor
and
the
like
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
you
're
always
doing
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
say
you
,
I
mean
such
men
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
see
it
every
day
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
business
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
say
,
"
urged
Pancks
,
"
Go
in
and
win
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
of
Go
in
and
lose
?
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
be
done
,
sir
,
"
returned
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
looked
into
it
.
<EOS>
Name
up
everywhere
---
immense
resources
---
enormous
capital
---
<EOS>
great
position
---
high
connection
---
government
influence
.
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
be
done
!
"
   
<EOS>
Gradually
,
after
this
closing
exposition
,
Mr
Pancks
subsided
;
allowed
his
hair
to
droop
as
much
as
it
ever
would
droop
on
the
utmost
persuasion
;
reclaimed
the
pipe
from
the
fire
-
irons
,
filled
it
anew
,
and
smoked
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
little
more
;
but
were
company
to
one
another
in
silently
pursuing
the
same
subjects
,
and
did
not
part
until
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
On
taking
his
leave
,
Mr
Pancks
,
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
Clennam
,
worked
completely
round
him
before
he
steamed
out
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
Arthur
received
as
an
assurance
that
he
might
implicitly
rely
on
Pancks
,
if
he
ever
should
come
to
need
assistance
;
either
in
any
of
the
matters
of
which
they
had
spoken
that
night
,
or
any
other
subject
that
could
in
any
way
affect
himself
.
   
<EOS>
At
intervals
all
next
day
,
and
even
while
his
attention
was
fixed
on
other
things
,
he
thought
of
Mr
Pancks
's
investment
of
his
thousand
pounds
,
and
of
his
having
"
looked
into
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
Mr
Pancks
's
being
so
sanguine
in
this
matter
,
and
of
his
not
being
usually
of
a
sanguine
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
great
National
Department
,
and
of
the
delight
it
would
be
to
him
to
see
Doyce
better
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
darkly
threatening
place
that
went
by
the
name
of
Home
in
his
remembrance
,
and
of
the
gathering
shadows
which
made
it
yet
more
darkly
threatening
than
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
observed
anew
that
wherever
he
went
,
he
saw
,
or
heard
,
or
touched
,
the
celebrated
name
of
Merdle
;
he
found
it
difficult
even
to
remain
at
his
desk
a
couple
of
hours
,
without
having
it
presented
to
one
of
his
bodily
senses
through
some
agency
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
think
it
was
curious
too
that
it
should
be
everywhere
,
and
that
nobody
but
<EOS>
he
should
seem
to
have
any
mistrust
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Though
indeed
he
began
to
remember
,
<EOS>
when
he
got
to
this
,
even
he
did
not
mistrust
it
;
he
had
only
happened
to
keep
aloof
from
it
.
   
<EOS>
Such
symptoms
,
when
a
disease
of
the
kind
is
rife
,
are
usually
the
signs
of
sickening
.

Taking
Advice
 
<EOS>
When
it
became
known
to
the
Britons
on
the
shore
of
the
yellow
Tiber
that
their
intelligent
compatriot
,
Mr
Sparkler
,
was
made
one
of
the
Lords
of
their
Circumlocution
Office
,
they
took
it
as
a
piece
of
news
with
which
they
had
no
nearer
concern
than
with
any
other
piece
of
news
---
any
other
Accident
or
Offence
---
in
the
English
papers
.
 
<EOS>
Some
laughed
;
some
said
,
by
way
of
complete
excuse
,
that
the
post
was
virtually
a
sinecure
,
and
any
fool
who
could
spell
his
name
was
good
enough
for
it
;
some
,
and
these
the
more
solemn
political
oracles
<EOS>
,
said
that
Decimus
did
wisely
to
strengthen
himself
,
and
that
the
sole
constitutional
purpose
of
all
places
within
the
gift
of
Decimus
,
was
,
that
Decimus
should
strengthen
himself
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
bilious
Britons
there
were
who
would
not
subscribe
to
this
article
of
faith
;
but
their
objection
was
purely
theoretical
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
practical
point
of
view
,
they
listlessly
abandoned
the
matter
,
as
being
the
business
of
some
other
Britons
unknown
,
somewhere
,
or
nowhere
.
 
<EOS>
In
like
manner
,
at
home
,
great
numbers
of
Britons
maintained
,
for
as
long
as
four
-
and
-
twenty
consecutive
hours
,
that
those
invisible
and
anonymous
Britons
"
ought
to
take
it
up
;
"
and
that
if
they
quietly
acquiesced
in
it
,
they
deserved
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
what
class
the
remiss
Britons
were
composed
,
and
where
the
unlucky
creatures
hid
themselves
,
and
why
they
hid
themselves
,
and
how
it
constantly
happened
that
they
neglected
their
interests
,
when
so
many
other
Britons
were
quite
at
a
loss
to
account
for
their
not
looking
after
those
interests
,
was
not
,
either
upon
the
shore
of
the
yellow
Tiber
or
the
shore
of
the
black
Thames
,
made
apparent
to
men
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
circulated
the
news
,
as
she
received
congratulations
on
it
,
with
a
careless
grace
that
displayed
it
to
advantage
,
as
the
setting
displays
the
jewel
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
said
,
Edmund
had
taken
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
wished
him
to
take
it
,
and
he
had
taken
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
hoped
Edmund
might
like
it
,
but
really
she
did
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
keep
him
in
town
a
good
deal
,
and
he
preferred
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
it
was
not
a
disagreeable
position
---
and
it
was
a
position
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
denying
that
the
thing
was
a
compliment
to
Mr
Merdle
,
and
was
not
a
bad
thing
for
Edmund
if
he
liked
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
just
as
well
that
he
should
have
something
to
do
,
and
it
was
just
as
well
that
he
should
have
something
for
doing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
would
be
more
agreeable
to
Edmund
than
the
army
,
remained
to
be
seen
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
the
Bosom
;
accomplished
in
the
art
of
seeming
to
make
things
of
small
account
,
and
really
enhancing
them
in
the
process
.
 
<EOS>
While
Henry
Gowan
,
whom
Decimus
had
thrown
away
,
went
through
the
whole
round
of
his
acquaintance
between
the
Gate
of
the
People
and
the
town
of
Albano
,
vowing
,
almost
(
but
not
quite
)
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
that
Sparkler
was
the
sweetest
-
tempered
,
simplest
-
hearted
,
altogether
most
lovable
jackass
that
ever
grazed
on
the
public
common
;
and
that
only
one
circumstance
could
have
delighted
him
(
Gowan
)
more
,
than
his
(
the
beloved
jackass
's
)
getting
this
post
,
and
that
would
have
been
his
(
Gowan
's
)
getting
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
the
very
thing
for
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
do
,
and
he
would
do
it
charmingly
;
there
was
a
handsome
salary
to
draw
,
and
he
would
draw
it
charmingly
;
it
was
a
delightful
,
appropriate
,
capital
appointment
;
and
he
almost
forgave
the
donor
his
slight
of
himself
,
in
his
joy
that
the
dear
donkey
for
whom
he
had
so
great
<EOS>
an
affection
was
so
admirably
stabled
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
his
benevolence
stop
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
pains
,
on
all
social
occasions
,
to
draw
Mr
Sparkler
out
,
and
make
him
conspicuous
before
the
company
;
and
,
although
the
considerate
action
always
resulted
in
that
young
gentleman
's
making
a
dreary
and
forlorn
mental
spectacle
of
himself
,
the
friendly
intention
was
not
to
be
doubted
.
   
<EOS>
Unless
,
indeed
,
it
chanced
to
be
doubted
by
the
object
of
Mr
Sparkler
's
affections
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
was
now
in
the
difficult
situation
of
being
universally
known
in
that
light
,
and
of
not
having
dismissed
Mr
Sparkler
,
however
capriciously
she
used
him
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
she
was
sufficiently
identified
with
the
gentleman
to
feel
compromised
by
his
being
more
than
usually
ridiculous
;
and
hence
,
being
by
no
means
deficient
in
quickness
,
she
sometimes
came
to
his
rescue
against
Gowan
,
and
did
him
very
good
service
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
while
doing
this
,
she
was
ashamed
of
him
,
undetermined
whether
to
get
rid
of
him
or
more
decidedly
encourage
him
,
distracted
with
apprehensions
that
she
was
every
day
becoming
more
and
more
immeshed
in
her
uncertainties
,
and
tortured
by
misgivings
that
Mrs
Merdle
triumphed
in
her
distress
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
tumult
in
her
mind
,
it
is
no
subject
for
surprise
that
Miss
Fanny
came
home
one
night
in
a
state
of
agitation
from
a
concert
and
ball
at
Mrs
Merdle
's
house
,
and
on
her
sister
affectionately
trying
to
soothe
her
,
<EOS>
pushed
that
sister
away
from
the
toilette
-
table
at
which
she
sat
angrily
trying
to
cry
,
and
declared
with
a
heaving
bosom
that
she
detested
everybody
,
and
she
wished
she
was
dead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Fanny
,
what
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Matter
,
you
little
Mole
,
"
said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
not
the
blindest
of
the
blind
,
you
would
have
no
occasion
to
ask
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
daring
to
pretend
to
assert
that
you
have
eyes
in
your
head
,
and
yet
ask
me
what
's
the
matter
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
Mr
Sparkler
,
dear
?
"
<EOS>
"
Mis
-
ter
Spark
-
ler
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Fanny
,
with
unbounded
scorn
,
as
if
he
were
the
last
subject
in
the
Solar
system
that
could
possibly
be
near
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
Bat
,
it
is
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
,
she
became
remorseful
for
having
called
her
sister
names
;
declaring
with
sobs
that
she
knew
she
made
herself
hateful
,
but
that
everybody
drove
her
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
are
well
to
-
night
,
dear
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
"
replied
the
young
lady
,
turning
angry
again
;
"
I
am
as
well
as
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
might
say
better
,
and
yet
make
no
boast
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Little
Dorrit
,
not
seeing
her
way
to
the
offering
of
any
soothing
words
that
would
escape
repudiation
,
deemed
it
best
to
remain
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
Fanny
took
this
ill
,
too
;
protesting
to
her
looking
-
glass
,
that
of
all
the
trying
sisters
a
girl
could
have
,
she
did
think
the
most
trying
sister
was
a
flat
sister
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
knew
she
was
at
times
a
wretched
temper
<EOS>
;
that
she
knew
she
made
herself
hateful
;
that
when
she
made
herself
hateful
,
nothing
would
do
her
half
the
good
as
being
told
so
;
but
that
,
being
afflicted
with
a
flat
sister
,
she
never
WAS
told
so
,
and
the
consequence
resulted
that
she
was
absolutely
tempted
and
goaded
into
making
herself
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
(
she
angrily
told
her
looking
-
glass
)
,
she
did
n't
want
to
be
forgiven
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
right
example
,
that
she
should
be
constantly
stooping
to
be
forgiven
by
a
younger
sister
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
Art
of
it
---
that
she
was
always
being
placed
in
the
position
of
being
forgiven
,
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
she
burst
into
violent
weeping
,
and
,
when
her
sister
came
and
sat
close
at
her
side
to
comfort
her
,
said
,
"
Amy
,
you
're
an
Angel
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
I
tell
you
what
,
my
Pet
,
"
said
Fanny
,
when
her
sister
's
gentleness
had
calmed
her
,
"
it
now
comes
to
this
;
that
things
can
not
and
shall
not
go
on
as
they
are
at
present
going
on
,
and
that
there
must
be
an
end
of
this
,
one
way
or
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
announcement
was
vague
,
though
very
peremptory
,
Little
Dorrit
returned
,
"
Let
us
talk
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
so
,
my
dear
,
"
assented
Fanny
,
as
she
dried
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
talk
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
rational
again
now
,
and
you
shall
advise
me
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
advise
me
,
my
sweet
child
?
"
   
<EOS>
Even
Amy
smiled
at
this
notion
,
but
she
said
,
"
I
will
,
Fanny
,
as
well
as
I
can
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
dearest
Amy
,
"
returned
Fanny
,
kissing
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
my
anchor
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
embraced
her
Anchor
with
great
affection
,
Fanny
took
a
bottle
of
sweet
toilette
water
from
the
table
,
and
called
to
her
maid
for
a
fine
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
dismissed
that
attendant
for
the
night
,
and
went
on
to
be
advised
;
dabbing
her
eyes
and
forehead
from
time
to
time
to
cool
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
Fanny
began
,
"
our
characters
and
points
of
view
are
sufficiently
different
(
kiss
me
again
,
my
darling
)
,
to
make
it
very
probable
that
I
shall
surprise
you
by
what
I
am
going
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
am
going
to
say
,
my
dear
,
is
,
that
notwithstanding
our
property
,
we
labour
,
socially
speaking
,
under
disadvantages
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
quite
understand
what
I
mean
,
Amy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
I
shall
,
"
said
Amy
,
mildly
,
"
after
a
few
words
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
what
I
mean
is
,
that
we
are
,
after
all
,
newcomers
into
fashionable
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
Fanny
,
"
Little
Dorrit
interposed
in
her
zealous
admiration
,
"
no
one
need
find
that
out
in
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
child
,
perhaps
not
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
though
it
's
most
kind
and
most
affectionate
in
you
,
you
precious
girl
,
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
she
dabbed
her
sister
's
forehead
,
and
blew
upon
it
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
you
are
,
"
resumed
Fanny
,
"
as
is
well
known
,
the
dearest
little
thing
that
ever
was
!
 
<EOS>
To
resume
,
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
Pa
is
extremely
gentlemanly
and
extremely
well
informed
,
but
he
is
,
in
some
trifling
respects
,
a
little
different
from
other
gentlemen
of
his
fortune
:
partly
on
account
of
what
he
has
gone
through
,
poor
dear
:
partly
,
I
fancy
,
on
account
of
its
often
running
in
his
mind
that
other
people
are
thinking
about
that
,
while
he
is
talking
to
them
.
<EOS>
Uncle
,
my
love
,
is
altogether
unpresentable
.
 
<EOS>
Though
a
dear
creature
to
whom
I
am
tenderly
attached
,
he
is
,
socially
speaking
,
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
is
frightfully
expensive
and
dissipated
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
that
there
is
anything
ungenteel
in
that
itself
---
far
from
it
---
<EOS>
but
I
do
mean
that
he
does
n't
do
it
well
,
and
that
he
does
n't
,
if
I
may
so
express
myself
,
get
the
money's
-
worth
in
the
sort
of
dissipated
reputation
that
attaches
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
Edward
!
"
sighed
Little
Dorrit
,
with
the
whole
family
history
in
the
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
And
poor
you
and
me
,
too
,
"
returned
Fanny
,
rather
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
true
!
 
<EOS>
Then
,
my
dear
,
we
have
no
mother
,
and
we
have
a
Mrs
General
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
tell
you
again
,
darling
,
that
Mrs
General
,
if
I
may
reverse
a
common
proverb
and
adapt
it
to
her
,
is
a
cat
in
gloves
who
WILL
catch
mice
.
 
<EOS>
That
woman
,
I
am
quite
sure
and
confident
,
will
be
our
mother
-
in
-
law
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
think
,
Fanny
---
"
Fanny
stopped
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
argue
with
me
about
it
,
Amy
,
"
said
she
,
"
because
I
know
better
.
"
 
<EOS>
Feeling
that
she
had
been
sharp
again
<EOS>
,
she
dabbed
her
sister
's
forehead
again
,
and
blew
upon
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
resume
once
more
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
It
then
becomes
a
question
with
me
<EOS>
(
I
am
proud
and
spirited
,
<EOS>
Amy
,
as
you
very
well
know
:
too
much
so
,
I
dare
say
)
whether
I
shall
make
up
my
mind
to
take
it
upon
myself
to
carry
the
family
through
.
"
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
asked
her
sister
,
anxiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
"
said
Fanny
,
without
answering
the
question
,
"
submit
to
be
mother
-
in
-
lawed
by
Mrs
General
;
and
I
will
not
submit
to
be
,
in
any
respect
whatever
,
either
patronised
or
tormented
by
Mrs
Merdle
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
laid
her
hand
upon
the
hand
that
held
the
bottle
of
sweet
water
,
with
a
still
more
anxious
look
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
,
quite
punishing
her
own
forehead
with
the
vehement
dabs
she
now
began
to
give
it
,
fitfully
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
he
has
somehow
or
other
,
and
how
is
of
no
consequence
,
attained
a
very
good
position
,
no
one
can
deny
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
is
a
very
good
connection
,
no
one
can
deny
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
question
of
clever
or
not
clever
,
I
doubt
very
much
whether
a
clever
husband
would
be
suitable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
submit
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
able
to
defer
to
him
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
my
dear
Fanny
!
"
expostulated
Little
Dorrit
,
upon
whom
a
kind
of
terror
had
been
stealing
as
she
perceived
what
her
sister
meant
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
loved
any
one
,
all
this
feeling
would
change
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
loved
any
one

you
would
no
more
be
yourself

but
you
would
quite
lose

forget
yourself
in
your
devotion
to
him

<EOS>
If
you
loved
him
,
Fanny
---
"
Fanny
had
stopped
the
dabbing
hand
,
and
was
looking
at
her
fixedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
,
indeed
!
"
cried
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Really
?
 
<EOS>
Bless
me
,
how
much
some
people
know
of
some
subjects
!
 
<EOS>
They
say
every
one
has
a
subject
,
and
I
certainly
seem
to
have
hit
upon
yours
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
you
little
thing
,
I
was
only
in
fun
,
"
dabbing
her
sister
's
forehead
;
"
but
do
n't
you
be
a
silly
puss
,
and
do
n't
you
think
flightily
and
eloquently
about
degenerate
impossibilities
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
'll
go
back
to
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Fanny
,
let
me
say
first
,
that
I
would
far
<EOS>
rather
we
worked
for
a
scanty
living
again
than
I
would
see
you
rich
and
married
to
Mr
Sparkler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
you
say
,
my
dear
?
"
retorted
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
,
I
will
let
you
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
constraint
upon
you
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
together
to
talk
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
marrying
Mr
Sparkler
,
I
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
doing
so
to
-
night
,
my
dear
,
or
to
-
morrow
morning
either
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
at
some
time
?
"
   
"
At
no
time
,
for
anything
I
know
at
present
,
"
answered
Fanny
,
with
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
suddenly
changing
her
indifference
into
a
burning
restlessness
,
she
added
,
"
You
talk
about
the
clever
men
,
you
little
thing
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
fine
and
easy
to
talk
about
the
clever
men
;
but
where
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
them
anywhere
near
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Fanny
,
so
short
a
time
---
"
   
"
Short
time
or
long
time
,
"
interrupted
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
impatient
of
our
situation
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
our
situation
,
and
very
little
would
induce
me
to
change
it
.
 
<EOS>
Other
girls
,
differently
reared
and
differently
circumstanced
altogether
,
might
wonder
at
what
I
say
or
may
do
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
driven
by
their
lives
and
characters
;
I
am
driven
by
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
my
dear
Fanny
<EOS>
,
you
know
that
you
have
qualities
to
make
you
the
wife
of
one
very
superior
to
Mr
Sparkler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
my
dear
Amy
,
"
retorted
Fanny
,
parodying
her
words
,
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
wish
to
have
a
more
defined
and
distinct
position
,
in
which
I
can
assert
myself
with
greater
effect
against
that
insolent
woman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
therefore
---
forgive
my
asking
,
Fanny
---
therefore
marry
her
son
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Fanny
,
with
a
triumphant
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
may
be
many
less
promising
ways
of
arriving
at
an
end
than
that
,
MY
dear
.
<EOS>
That
piece
of
insolence
may
think
,
now
,
that
it
would
be
a
great
success
to
get
her
son
off
upon
me
,
and
shelve
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
she
little
thinks
how
I
would
retort
upon
her
if
I
married
her
son
.
   
<EOS>
I
would
oppose
her
in
everything
,
and
compete
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
make
it
the
business
of
my
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fanny
set
down
the
bottle
when
she
came
to
this
,
and
walked
about
the
room
;
always
stopping
and
standing
still
while
she
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
thing
I
could
certainly
do
,
my
child
:
I
could
make
her
older
.
<EOS>
And
I
would
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
followed
by
another
walk
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
talk
of
her
as
an
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
pretend
to
know
 
---
if
I
did
n't
,
but
I
should
from
her
son
---
all
about
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
should
hear
me
say
,
<EOS>
Amy
:
affectionately
,
quite
dutifully
and
affectionately
:
how
well
she
looked
,
considering
her
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
could
make
her
seem
older
at
once
,
by
being
myself
so
much
younger
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
as
handsome
as
she
is
;
I
am
not
a
fair
judge
of
that
question
,
I
suppose
;
but
I
know
I
am
handsome
enough
to
be
a
thorn
in
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
would
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sister
,
would
you
condemn
yourself
to
an
unhappy
life
for
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
be
an
unhappy
life
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
life
I
am
fitted
for
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
by
disposition
,
or
whether
by
circumstances
,
is
no
matter
;
I
am
better
fitted
for
such
a
life
than
for
almost
any
other
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
of
a
desolate
tone
in
those
words
;
but
,
with
a
short
proud
laugh
she
took
another
walk
,
and
after
passing
a
great
looking
-
glass
came
to
another
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Figure
!
 
<EOS>
Figure
,
Amy
!
 
<EOS>
Well
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
has
a
good
figure
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
her
her
due
,
and
not
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
is
it
so
far
beyond
all
others
that
it
is
altogether
unapproachable
?
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
I
am
not
so
sure
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Give
some
much
younger
woman
the
latitude
as
to
dress
that
she
has
,
being
married
;
and
we
would
see
about
that
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
Something
in
the
thought
that
was
agreeable
and
flattering
,
brought
her
back
to
her
seat
in
a
gayer
temper
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
her
sister
's
hands
in
hers
,
and
clapped
all
four
hands
above
her
head
as
she
looked
in
her
sister
's
face
laughing
:
   
"
<EOS>
And
the
dancer
,
Amy
,
that
she
has
quite
forgotten
---
the
dancer
who
bore
no
sort
of
resemblance
to
me
,
and
of
whom
I
never
remind
her
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
!
---
should
dance
through
her
life
,
and
dance
in
her
way
,
to
such
a
tune
as
would
disturb
her
insolent
placidity
a
little
.
<EOS>
just
a
little
,
my
dear
Amy
,
just
a
little
!
"
   
<EOS>
Meeting
an
earnest
and
imploring
look
in
Amy
's
face
,
she
brought
the
four
hands
down
,
and
laid
only
one
on
Amy
's
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
argue
with
me
,
child
,
"
she
said
in
a
sterner
way
,
"
because
it
is
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
these
subjects
much
better
than
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
nearly
made
up
my
mind
,
but
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
Now
we
have
talked
this
over
comfortably
,
and
may
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
You
best
and
dearest
little
mouse
,
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
those
words
Fanny
weighed
her
Anchor
,
and
---
having
taken
so
much
advice
---
left
off
being
advised
for
that
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Thenceforward
,
Amy
observed
Mr
Sparkler
's
treatment
by
his
enslaver
,
with
new
reasons
for
attaching
importance
to
all
that
passed
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
times
when
Fanny
appeared
quite
unable
to
endure
his
mental
feebleness
,
and
when
she
became
so
sharply
impatient
of
it
that
she
would
all
but
dismiss
him
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
other
times
when
she
got
on
much
better
with
him
;
when
he
amused
her
,
and
when
her
sense
of
superiority
seemed
to
counterbalance
that
opposite
side
of
the
scale
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Sparkler
had
been
other
than
the
faithfullest
and
most
submissive
of
swains
,
he
was
sufficiently
hard
pressed
to
have
fled
from
the
scene
of
his
trials
,
and
have
set
at
least
the
whole
distance
from
Rome
to
London
between
himself
and
his
enchantress
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
greater
will
of
his
own
than
a
boat
has
when
it
is
towed
by
a
steam
-
ship
;
and
he
followed
his
cruel
mistress
through
rough
and
smooth
,
on
equally
strong
compulsion
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
,
during
these
passages
,
said
little
to
Fanny
,
but
said
more
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
,
as
it
were
,
forced
to
look
at
her
through
her
eye
-
glass
,
and
in
general
conversation
to
allow
commendations
of
her
beauty
to
be
wrung
from
her
by
its
irresistible
demands
.
<EOS>
The
defiant
character
it
assumed
when
Fanny
heard
these
extollings
(
as
it
generally
happened
that
she
did
)
,
was
not
expressive
of
concessions
to
the
impartial
bosom
;
but
the
utmost
revenge
the
bosom
took
was
,
to
say
audibly
,
"
A
spoilt
beauty
---
but
with
that
face
and
shape
,
who
could
wonder
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
about
a
month
or
six
weeks
after
the
night
of
the
new
advice
,
when
Little
Dorrit
began
to
think
she
detected
some
new
understanding
between
Mr
Sparkler
and
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
,
as
if
in
attendance
to
some
compact
,
scarcely
ever
spoke
without
first
looking
towards
Fanny
for
leave
.
 
<EOS>
That
young
lady
was
too
discreet
ever
to
look
back
again
;
but
,
if
Mr
Sparkler
had
permission
to
speak
,
she
remained
silent
;
if
he
had
not
,
she
herself
spoke
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
became
plain
whenever
Henry
Gowan
attempted
to
perform
the
friendly
office
of
drawing
him
out
,
that
he
was
not
to
be
drawn
.
 
<EOS>
And
not
only
that
,
but
Fanny
<EOS>
would
presently
,
without
any
pointed
application
in
the
world
,
chance
to
say
something
with
such
a
sting
in
it
that
Gowan
would
draw
back
as
if
he
had
put
his
hand
into
a
bee
-
hive
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
yet
another
circumstance
which
went
a
long
way
to
confirm
Little
Dorrit
in
her
fears
,
though
it
was
not
a
great
circumstance
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
's
demeanour
towards
herself
changed
.
 
<EOS>
It
became
fraternal
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
when
she
was
in
the
outer
circle
of
assemblies
---
at
their
own
residence
,
at
Mrs
Merdle
's
,
or
elsewhere
---
she
would
find
herself
stealthily
supported
round
the
waist
by
Mr
Sparkler
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
never
offered
the
slightest
explanation
of
this
attention
;
but
merely
smiled
with
an
air
of
blundering
,
contented
,
good
-
natured
proprietorship
,
which
,
in
so
heavy
a
gentleman
,
was
ominously
expressive
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
at
home
one
day
,
thinking
about
Fanny
with
a
heavy
heart
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
room
at
one
end
of
their
drawing
-
room
suite
,
nearly
all
irregular
bay
-
window
,
projecting
over
the
street
,
and
commanding
all
the
picturesque
life
and
variety
of
the
Corso
,
both
up
and
down
.
 
<EOS>
At
three
or
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
English
time
,
the
view
from
this
window
was
very
bright
and
peculiar
;
and
Little
Dorrit
used
to
sit
and
muse
here
,
much
as
she
had
been
used
to
while
away
the
time
in
her
balcony
at
Venice
.
<EOS>
Seated
thus
one
day
,
she
was
softly
touched
on
the
shoulder
,
and
Fanny
said
,
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Amy
dear
,
"
and
took
her
seat
at
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
Their
seat
was
a
part
of
the
window
;
when
there
was
anything
in
the
way
of
a
procession
going
on
,
they
used
to
have
bright
draperies
hung
out
of
the
window
,
and
used
to
kneel
or
sit
on
this
seat
,
and
look
out
at
it
,
leaning
on
the
brilliant
colour
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
procession
that
day
,
and
Little
Dorrit
was
rather
surprised
by
Fanny
's
being
at
home
at
that
hour
,
as
she
was
generally
out
on
horseback
then
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Amy
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
what
are
you
thinking
of
,
little
one
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
of
you
,
Fanny
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
coincidence
!
 
<EOS>
I
declare
here
's
some
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
not
thinking
of
this
some
one
else
too
;
were
you
,
Amy
?
"
   
<EOS>
Amy
HAD
been
thinking
of
this
some
one
else
too
;
for
it
was
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
say
so
,
however
,
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
came
and
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
and
she
felt
the
fraternal
railing
come
behind
her
,
and
apparently
stretch
on
to
include
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
little
sister
,
"
said
Fanny
with
a
sigh
,
"
I
suppose
you
know
what
this
means
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
as
beautiful
as
she
's
doated
on
,
"
stammered
Mr
Sparkler
---
"
and
there
's
no
nonsense
about
her
<EOS>
---
it
's
arranged
---
"
   
"
You
need
n't
explain
,
Edmund
,
"
said
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
pet
,
"
proceeded
Fanny
,
"
on
the
whole
,
we
are
engaged
.
<EOS>
We
must
tell
papa
about
it
either
to
-
night
or
to
-
morrow
,
according
to
the
opportunities
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
's
done
,
and
very
little
more
need
be
said
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Fanny
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
,
with
deference
,
"
I
should
like
to
say
a
word
to
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
Say
it
for
goodness
'
sake
,
"
returned
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
convinced
,
my
dear
Amy
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
,
"
that
if
ever
there
was
a
girl
,
next
to
your
highly
endowed
and
beautiful
sister
,
who
had
no
nonsense
about
her
---
"
   
"
We
know
all
about
that
,
Edmund
,
"
interposed
Miss
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
that
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
go
on
to
something
else
besides
our
having
no
nonsense
about
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
assure
you
,

<EOS>
interrupted
Fanny
,
with
a
slight
pat
of
her
pretty
foot
upon
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
you
're
quite
right
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
know
I
have
a
habit
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
wished
to
declare
was
,
that
nothing
can
be
a
greater
happiness
to
myself
,
myself
-
next
to
the
happiness
of
being
united
to

than
to
have
the
happiness
of
cultivating
the
affectionate
acquaintance
of
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
manfully
,
"
be
up
to
the
mark
on
some
other
subjects
at
a
short
notice
,
and
I
am
aware
that
if
you
were
to
poll
Society
the
general
opinion
would
be
that
I
am
not
;
but
on
the
subject
of
Amy
<EOS>
I
am
up
to
the
mark
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
kissed
her
,
in
witness
thereof
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
knife
and
fork
and
an
apartment
,
"
proceeded
Mr
Sparkler
,
growing
,
in
comparison
with
his
oratorical
antecedents
,
quite
diffuse
,
"
will
ever
be
at
Amy
's
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
My
Governor
,
I
am
sure
,
will
always
be
proud
to
entertain
one
whom
I
so
much
esteem
.
 
<EOS>
And
regarding
my
mother
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
,
"
who
is
a
remarkably
fine
woman
,
with
---
"
   
"
Edmund
,
Edmund
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Fanny
,
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
submission
,
my
soul
,
"
pleaded
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
have
a
habit
of
it
,
and
I
thank
you
very
much
,
my
adorable
girl
,
for
taking
the
trouble
to
correct
it
;
but
my
mother
is
admitted
on
all
sides
to
be
a
remarkably
fine
woman
,
and
she
really
has
n't
any
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
,
or
may
not
be
,
"
returned
Fanny
,
"
but
pray
<EOS>
do
n't
mention
it
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
in
fact
,
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
Edmund
;
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
far
from
it
,
my
adorable
girl
,
"
answered
Mr
Sparkler
,
"
I
apologise
for
having
said
so
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
perceived
,
by
a
kind
of
inspiration
,
that
the
question
implied
had
he
not
better
go
?
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
withdrew
the
fraternal
railing
,
and
neatly
said
that
he
thought
he
would
,
with
submission
,
take
his
leave
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
go
without
being
congratulated
by
Amy
,
as
well
as
she
could
discharge
that
office
in
the
flutter
and
distress
of
her
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
she
said
,
"
O
Fanny
,
Fanny
!
"
and
turned
to
her
sister
in
the
bright
window
,
and
fell
upon
her
bosom
and
cried
there
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
laughed
at
first
;
but
soon
laid
her
face
against
her
sister
's
and
cried
too
---
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
time
<EOS>
Fanny
ever
showed
that
there
was
any
hidden
,
suppressed
,
or
conquered
feeling
in
her
on
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
hour
the
way
she
had
chosen
lay
before
her
,
and
she
trod
it
with
her
own
imperious
self
-
willed
step
.

Chapter

<EOS>
No
just
Cause
or
Impediment
why
these
Two
Persons
should
not
be
joined
together
 
Mr
Dorrit
,
on
being
informed
by
his
elder
daughter
that
she
had
accepted
matrimonial
overtures
from
Mr
Sparkler
,
to
whom
she
had
plighted
her
troth
,
received
the
communication
at
once
with
great
dignity
and
with
a
large
display
of
parental
pride
;
his
dignity
dilating
with
the
widened
prospect
of
advantageous
ground
from
which
to
make
acquaintances
,
and
his
parental
pride
being
developed
by
Miss
Fanny
's
ready
sympathy
with
that
great
object
of
his
existence
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
her
to
understand
that
her
noble
ambition
found
harmonious
echoes
in
his
heart
;
and
bestowed
his
blessing
on
her
,
as
a
child
brimful
of
duty
and
good
principle
,
self
-
devoted
to
the
aggrandisement
of
the
family
name
.
   
<EOS>
To
Mr
Sparkler
,
when
Miss
Fanny
permitted
him
to
appear
,
Mr
Dorrit
said
,
he
would
not
disguise
that
the
alliance
Mr
Sparkler
did
him
the
honour
to
propose
was
highly
congenial
to
his
feelings
;
both
as
being
in
unison
with
the
spontaneous
affections
of
his
daughter
Fanny
,
and
as
opening
a
family
connection
of
a
gratifying
nature
with
Mr
Merdle
,
the
master
spirit
of
the
age
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
also
,
as
a
leading
lady
rich
in
distinction
,
elegance
,
grace
,
and
beauty
,
he
mentioned
in
very
laudatory
terms
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
it
his
duty
to
remark
<EOS>
(
he
was
sure
a
gentleman
of
Mr
Sparkler
's
fine
sense
would
interpret
him
with
all
delicacy
)
,
that
he
could
not
consider
this
proposal
definitely
determined
on
,
until
he
should
have
had
the
privilege
of
holding
some
correspondence
with
Mr
Merdle
;
and
of
ascertaining
it
to
be
so
far
accordant
with
the
views
of
that
eminent
gentleman
as
that
his
(
Mr
Dorrit
's
)
daughter
would
be
received
on
that
footing
which
her
station
in
life
and
her
dowry
and
expectations
warranted
him
in
requiring
that
she
should
maintain
in
what
he
trusted
he
might
be
allowed
,
without
the
appearance
of
being
mercenary
,
to
call
the
Eye
of
the
Great
World
.
<EOS>
While
saying
this
,
which
his
character
as
a
gentleman
of
some
little
station
,
and
his
character
as
a
father
,
equally
demanded
of
him
,
he
would
not
be
so
diplomatic
as
to
conceal
that
the
proposal
remained
in
hopeful
abeyance
and
under
conditional
acceptance
,
and
that
he
thanked
Mr
Sparkler
for
the
compliment
rendered
to
himself
and
to
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
concluded
with
some
further
and
more
general
observations
on
the
---
ha
---
character
of
an
independent
gentleman
,
and
the
---
hum
---
character
of
a
possibly
too
partial
and
admiring
parent
.
<EOS>
To
sum
the
whole
up
shortly
,
he
received
Mr
Sparkler
's
offer
very
much
as
he
would
have
received
three
or
four
half
-
crowns
from
him
in
the
days
that
were
gone
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
,
finding
himself
stunned
by
the
words
thus
heaped
upon
his
inoffensive
head
,
made
a
brief
though
pertinent
rejoinder
;
the
same
being
neither
more
nor
less
than
that
he
had
long
perceived
Miss
Fanny
to
have
no
nonsense
about
her
,
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
its
being
all
right
with
his
Governor
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
point
the
object
of
his
affections
shut
him
up
like
a
box
with
a
spring
lid
,
and
sent
him
away
.
   
<EOS>
Proceeding
shortly
afterwards
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
Bosom
,
Mr
Dorrit
was
received
by
it
with
great
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
had
heard
of
this
affair
from
Edmund
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
surprised
at
first
,
because
she
had
not
thought
Edmund
a
marrying
man
.
 
<EOS>
Society
had
not
thought
Edmund
a
marrying
man
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
of
course
she
had
seen
,
as
a
woman
(
we
women
did
instinctively
see
these
things
,
Mr
Dorrit
!
)
,
that
Edmund
had
been
immensely
captivated
by
Miss
Dorrit
,
and
she
had
openly
said
that
Mr
Dorrit
had
much
to
answer
for
in
bringing
so
charming
a
girl
abroad
to
turn
the
heads
of
his
countrymen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
the
honour
to
conclude
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
that
the
direction
which
Mr
Sparkler
's
affections
have
taken
,
is
---
ha
---
approved
of
by
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
"
that
,
personally
,
I
am
charmed
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
was
very
gratifying
to
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Personally
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
charmed
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
casual
repetition
of
the
word
"
personally
,
"
moved
Mr
Dorrit
to
express
his
hope
that
Mr
Merdle
's
approval
,
too
,
would
not
be
wanting
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
take
upon
myself
to
answer
positively
for
Mr
Merdle
;
gentlemen
,
especially
gentlemen
who
are
what
Society
calls
capitalists
,
having
their
own
ideas
of
these
matters
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
should
think
---
merely
giving
an
opinion
,
Mr
Dorrit
<EOS>
---
I
should
think
Mr
Merdle
would
be
upon
the
whole
,
"
here
she
held
a
review
of
herself
before
adding
at
her
leisure
,
"
quite
charmed
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
the
mention
of
gentlemen
whom
Society
called
capitalists
,
Mr
Dorrit
had
coughed
,
as
if
some
internal
demur
were
breaking
out
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
had
observed
it
,
and
went
on
to
take
up
the
cue
.
   
<EOS>
"
Though
,
indeed
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
it
is
scarcely
necessary
for
me
to
make
that
remark
,
except
in
the
mere
openness
of
saying
what
is
uppermost
to
one
whom
I
so
highly
regard
,
and
with
whom
I
hope
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
being
brought
into
still
more
agreeable
relations
.
 
<EOS>
For
one
can
not
but
see
the
great
probability
of
your
considering
such
things
from
Mr
Merdle
's
own
point
of
view
,
except
indeed
that
circumstances
have
made
it
Mr
Merdle
's
accidental
fortune
,
or
misfortune
,
to
be
engaged
in
business
transactions
,
and
that
they
,
however
vast
,
may
a
little
cramp
his
horizons
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
very
child
as
to
having
any
notion
of
business
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
;
"
but
I
am
afraid
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
it
may
have
that
tendency
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
skilful
see
-
saw
of
Mr
Dorrit
and
Mrs
Merdle
,
so
that
each
of
them
sent
the
other
up
,
and
each
of
them
sent
the
other
down
,
and
neither
had
the
advantage
,
acted
as
a
sedative
on
Mr
Dorrit
's
cough
.
 
<EOS>
He
remarked
with
his
utmost
politeness
,
that
he
must
beg
to
protest
against
its
being
supposed
,
even
by
Mrs
Merdle
,
the
accomplished
and
graceful
(
to
which
compliment
she
bent
herself
)
,
that
such
enterprises
as
Mr
Merdle
's
,
apart
as
they
were
from
the
puny
undertakings
of
the
rest
of
men
,
had
any
lower
tendency
than
to
enlarge
and
expand
the
genius
in
which
they
were
conceived
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
generosity
itself
,
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
in
return
,
smiling
her
best
smile
;
"
let
us
hope
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
confess
I
am
almost
superstitious
in
my
ideas
about
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
threw
in
another
compliment
here
,
to
the
effect
that
business
,
like
the
time
which
was
precious
in
it
,
was
made
for
slaves
;
and
that
it
was
not
for
Mrs
Merdle
,
who
ruled
all
hearts
at
her
supreme
pleasure
,
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
laughed
,
and
conveyed
to
Mr
Dorrit
an
idea
that
the
Bosom
flushed
---
which
was
one
of
her
best
effects
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
so
much
,
"
she
then
explained
,
"
merely
because
Mr
Merdle
has
always
taken
the
greatest
interest
in
Edmund
,
and
has
always
expressed
the
strongest
desire
to
advance
his
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
Edmund
's
public
position
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
His
private
position
rests
solely
with
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
foolish
incapacity
for
business
,
I
assure
you
I
know
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
again
expressed
,
in
his
own
way
,
the
sentiment
that
business
was
below
the
ken
of
enslavers
and
enchantresses
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
mentioned
his
intention
,
as
a
gentleman
and
a
parent
,
of
writing
to
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
concurred
with
all
her
heart
---
or
with
all
her
art
,
which
was
exactly
the
same
thing
---
and
herself
despatched
a
preparatory
letter
by
the
next
post
to
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
In
his
epistolary
communication
,
as
in
his
dialogues
and
discourses
on
the
great
question
to
which
it
related
,
Mr
Dorrit
surrounded
the
subject
with
flourishes
,
as
writing
-
masters
embellish
copy
-
books
and
ciphering
-
books
:
where
the
titles
of
the
elementary
rules
of
arithmetic
diverge
into
swans
,
eagles
,
griffins
,
and
other
calligraphic
recreations
,
and
where
the
capital
letters
go
out
of
their
minds
and
bodies
into
ecstasies
of
pen
and
ink
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
did
render
the
purport
of
his
letter
sufficiently
clear
,
to
enable
Mr
Merdle
to
make
a
decent
pretence
of
having
learnt
it
from
that
source
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
replied
to
it
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
replied
to
Mr
Merdle
;
Mr
Merdle
replied
to
Mr
Dorrit
;
and
it
was
soon
announced
that
the
corresponding
powers
had
come
to
a
satisfactory
understanding
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
and
not
before
,
Miss
Fanny
burst
upon
the
scene
,
completely
arrayed
for
her
new
part
.
 
<EOS>
Now
<EOS>
and
not
before
,
she
wholly
absorbed
Mr
Sparkler
in
her
light
,
and
shone
for
both
,
and
twenty
more
.
 
<EOS>
No
longer
feeling
that
want
of
a
defined
place
and
character
which
had
caused
her
so
much
trouble
,
this
fair
ship
began
to
steer
steadily
on
a
shaped
course
,
and
to
swim
with
a
weight
and
balance
that
developed
her
sailing
qualities
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
preliminaries
being
so
satisfactorily
arranged
,
I
think
I
will
now
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
announce
---
ha

<EOS>
formally
,
to
Mrs
General
---
"
   
"
Papa

"
returned
Fanny
,
taking
him
up
short
upon
that
name
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
what
Mrs
General
has
got
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
it
will
be
an
act
of
courtesy
to

hum

a
lady
,
well
bred
and
refined

"
   
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
I
am
sick
of
Mrs
General
's
good
breeding
and
refinement

said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
tired
of

Tired

"
repeated
Mr
Dorrit
in
reproachful
astonishment
,
"
of
---
ha
---
Mrs
General
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Quite
disgusted
with
her
,
papa
,
"
said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
n't
see
what
she
has
to
do
with
my
marriage

<EOS>
Let
her
keep
to
her
own
matrimonial
projects
---
if
she
has
any
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
returned
Mr
Dorrit
,
with
a
grave
and
weighty
slowness
upon
him
,
contrasting
strongly
with
his
daughter
's
levity
:
"
<EOS>
I
beg
the
favour
of
your
explaining
---
ha
---
<EOS>
what
it
is
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
papa
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
that
if
Mrs
General
should
happen
to
have
any
matrimonial
projects
of
her
own
,
I
dare
say
they
are
quite
enough
to
occupy
her
spare
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
if
she
has
not
,
so
much
the
better
;
but
still
I
do
n't
wish
to
have
the
honour
of
making
announcements
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
to
ask
you
,
Fanny
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
she
can
find
my
engagement
out
for
herself
,
papa
,
"
retorted
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
watchful
enough
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
seen
her
so
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
find
it
out
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
should
not
find
it
out
for
herself
,
she
will
know
it
when
I
am
married
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
will
not
consider
me
wanting
in
affection
for
you
,
papa
,
if
I
say
it
strikes
me
that
will
be
quite
enough
for
Mrs
General
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
returned
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
<EOS>
I
am
amazed
,
I
am
displeased
by
this
---
hum
---
this
capricious
and
unintelligible
display
of
animosity
towards
---
ha
---
Mrs
General
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
not
,
if
you
please
,
papa
,
"
urged
Fanny
,
"
call
it
animosity
,
because
I
assure
you
I
do
not
consider
Mrs
General
worth
my
animosity
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
,
Mr
Dorrit
rose
from
his
chair
with
a
fixed
look
of
severe
reproof
,
and
remained
standing
in
his
dignity
before
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
,
turning
the
bracelet
on
her
arm
,
and
now
looking
at
him
,
and
now
looking
from
him
,
said
,
"
Very
well
,
papa
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
truly
sorry
if
you
do
n't
like
it
;
but
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
child
,
and
I
am
not
Amy
,
and
I
must
speak
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
gasped
Mr
Dorrit
,
after
a
majestic
silence
,
"
if
I
request
you
to
remain
here
,
while
I
formally
announce
to
Mrs
General
,
as
an
exemplary
lady
,
who
is
---
hum
---
a
trusted
member
of
this
family
,
the
---
ha
---
the
change
that
is
contemplated
among
us
;
if
I
---
ha
---
not
only
request
it
,
but
---
<EOS>
hum
---
insist
upon
it
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
,
"
Fanny
broke
in
with
pointed
significance
,
"
if
you
make
so
much
of
it
as
that
,
I
have
in
duty
nothing
to
do
but
comply
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
have
my
thoughts
upon
the
subject
,
however
,
for
I
really
can
not
help
it
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
,
Fanny
sat
down
with
a
meekness
which
,
in
the
junction
of
extremes
,
became
defiance
;
and
her
father
,
either
not
deigning
to
answer
,
or
not
knowing
what
to
answer
,
summoned
Mr
Tinkler
into
his
presence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
General
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tinkler
,
unused
to
receive
such
short
orders
in
connection
with
the
fair
varnisher
,
paused
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
seeing
the
whole
Marshalsea
and
all
its
testimonials
in
the
pause
,
instantly
flew
at
him
with
,
"
How
dare
you
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
pleaded
Mr
Tinkler
,
"
I
was
wishful
to
know
---
"
<EOS>
"
You
wished
to
know
nothing
,
sir
,
"
cried
Mr
Dorrit
,
highly
flushed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
you
did
.
 
<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
You
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
guilty
of
mockery
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
sir
---
"
Mr
Tinkler
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
assure
me
!
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
assured
by
a
domestic
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
guilty
of
mockery
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
leave
me
---
<EOS>
hum
---
the
whole
establishment
shall
leave
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
waiting
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
for
my
orders
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
false
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
you
have
your
orders
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
---
hum
.
 
<EOS>
MY
compliments
to
Mrs
General
,
and
I
beg
the
favour
of
her
coming
to
me
,
if
quite
convenient
,
for
a
few
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Those
are
your
orders
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
his
execution
of
this
mission
,
Mr
Tinkler
perhaps
expressed
that
Mr
Dorrit
was
in
a
raging
fume
.
 
<EOS>
However
that
was
,
Mrs
General
's
skirts
were
very
speedily
heard
outside
,
coming
along
---
one
might
almost
have
said
bouncing
along
---
with
unusual
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
Albeit
,
they
settled
down
at
the
door
and
swept
into
the
room
with
their
customary
coolness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
General
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
take
a
chair
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
,
with
a
graceful
curve
of
acknowledgment
,
descended
into
the
chair
which
Mr
Dorrit
offered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
pursued
that
gentleman
,
"
as
you
have
had
the
kindness
to
undertake
the
---
hum
---
formation
of
my
daughters
,
and
as
I
am
persuaded
that
nothing
nearly
affecting
them
can
---
ha
---
be
indifferent
to
you
---
"
   
"
Wholly
impossible
,
"
said
Mrs
General
in
the
calmest
of
ways
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
I
therefore
wish
to
announce
to
you
,
madam
,
that
my
daughter
now
present
---
"
   
Mrs
General
made
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
to
Fanny
,
who
made
a
very
low
inclination
of
her
head
to
Mrs
General
,
and
came
loftily
upright
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
That
my
daughter
Fanny
is
---
ha

contracted
to
be
married
to
Mr
Sparkler
,
with
whom
you
are
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
madam
,
you
will
be
relieved
of
half
your
difficult
charge
---

---
difficult
charge
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
repeated
it
with
his
angry
eye
on
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
not
,
I
hope
,
to
the
---
hum
---
diminution
of
any
other
portion
,
direct
or
indirect
,
of
the
footing
you
have
at
present
the
kindness
to
occupy
in
my
family
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
returned
Mrs
General
,
with
her
gloved
hands
resting
on
one
another
in
exemplary
repose
,
"
is
ever
considerate
,
and
ever
but
too
appreciative
of
my
friendly
services
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
(
Miss
Fanny
coughed
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
You
are
right
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dorrit
has
no
doubt
exercised
the
soundest
discretion
of
which
the
circumstances
admitted
,
and
I
trust
will
allow
me
to
offer
her
my
sincere
congratulations
.
 
<EOS>
When
free
from
the
trammels
of
passion
,
"
Mrs
General
closed
her
eyes
at
the
word
,
as
if
she
could
not
utter
it
,
and
see
anybody
;
"
when
occurring
with
the
approbation
of
near
relatives
;
and
when
cementing
the
proud
structure
of
a
family
edifice
;
these
are
usually
auspicious
events
.
   
<EOS>
I
trust
Miss
Dorrit
will
allow
me
to
offer
her
my
best
congratulations
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
General
stopped
,
and
added
internally
,
for
the
setting
of
her
face
,
"
Papa
,
potatoes
,
poultry
,
Prunes
,
and
prism
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
she
superadded
aloud
,
"
is
ever
most
obliging
;
and
for
the
attention
,
and
I
will
add
distinction
,
of
having
this
confidence
imparted
to
me
by
himself
and
Miss
Dorrit
at
this
early
time
,
I
beg
to
offer
the
tribute
of
my
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
My
thanks
,
and
my
congratulations
,
are
equally
the
meed
of
Mr
Dorrit
and
of
Miss
Dorrit
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
me
,
"
observed
Miss
Fanny
,
"
they
are
excessively
gratifying
---
<EOS>
inexpressibly
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
relief
of
finding
that
you
have
no
objection
to
make
,
Mrs
General
,
quite
takes
a
load
off
my
mind
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
I
should
have
done
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
if
you
had
interposed
any
objection
,
Mrs
General
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
changed
her
gloves
,
as
to
the
right
glove
being
uppermost
and
the
left
undermost
,
with
a
Prunes
and
Prism
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
preserve
your
approbation
,
Mrs
General
,
"
said
Fanny
,
returning
the
smile
with
one
in
which
there
was
no
trace
of
those
ingredients
,
"
will
of
course
be
the
highest
object
of
my
married
life
;
to
lose
it
,
would
of
course
be
perfect
wretchedness
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
your
great
kindness
will
not
object
,
and
I
hope
papa
will
not
object
,
to
my
correcting
a
small
mistake
you
have
made
,
however
.
<EOS>
The
best
of
us
are
so
liable
to
mistakes
,
that
even
you
,
Mrs
General
,
have
fallen
into
a
little
error
.
 
<EOS>
The
attention
and
distinction
you
have
so
impressively
mentioned
,
Mrs
General
,
as
attaching
to
this
confidence
,
are
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
of
the
most
complimentary
and
gratifying
description
;
but
they
do
n't
at
all
proceed
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
merit
of
having
consulted
you
on
the
subject
would
have
been
so
great
in
me
,
that
I
feel
I
must
not
lay
claim
to
it
when
it
really
is
not
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
wholly
papa
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
deeply
obliged
to
you
for
your
encouragement
and
patronage
,
but
it
was
papa
who
asked
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
to
thank
you
,
Mrs
General
,
for
relieving
my
breast
of
a
great
weight
by
so
handsomely
giving
your
consent
to
my
engagement
,
but
you
have
really
nothing
to
thank
me
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
always
approve
of
my
proceedings
after
I
have
left
home
and
that
my
sister
also
may
long
remain
the
favoured
object
of
your
condescension
,
Mrs
General
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
address
,
which
was
delivered
in
her
politest
manner
,
Fanny
left
the
room
with
an
elegant
and
cheerful
air
---
to
tear
up
-
stairs
with
a
flushed
face
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
hearing
,
pounce
in
upon
her
sister
,
call
her
a
little
Dormouse
,
shake
her
for
the
better
opening
of
her
eyes
,
tell
her
what
had
passed
below
,
and
ask
her
what
she
thought
of
Pa
now
?
   
<EOS>
Towards
Mrs
Merdle
,
the
young
lady
comported
herself
with
great
independence
and
self
-
possession
;
but
not
as
yet
with
any
more
decided
opening
of
hostilities
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
they
had
a
slight
skirmish
,
as
when
Fanny
considered
herself
patted
on
the
back
by
that
lady
,
or
as
when
Mrs
Merdle
looked
particularly
young
and
well
;
but
Mrs
Merdle
always
soon
terminated
those
passages
of
arms
by
sinking
among
her
cushions
with
the
gracefullest
indifference
,
and
finding
her
attention
otherwise
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
Society
(
for
that
mysterious
creature
sat
upon
the
Seven
Hills
too
)
found
Miss
Fanny
vastly
improved
by
her
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
much
more
accessible
,
much
more
free
and
engaging
,
much
less
exacting
;
insomuch
that
she
now
entertained
a
host
of
followers
and
admirers
,
to
the
bitter
indignation
of
ladies
with
daughters
to
marry
,
who
were
to
be
regarded
as
Having
revolted
from
Society
on
the
Miss
Dorrit
grievance
,
and
erected
a
rebellious
standard
.
 
<EOS>
Enjoying
the
flutter
she
caused
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dorrit
not
only
haughtily
moved
through
it
in
her
own
proper
person
,
but
haughtily
,
even
Ostentatiously
,
led
Mr
Sparkler
through
it
too
:
seeming
to
say
to
them
all
,
"
If
I
think
proper
to
march
among
you
in
triumphal
procession
attended
by
this
weak
captive
in
bonds
,
rather
than
a
stronger
one
,
that
is
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
Enough
that
I
choose
to
do
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
for
his
part
,
questioned
nothing
;
but
went
wherever
he
was
taken
,
did
whatever
he
was
told
,
felt
that
for
his
bride
-
elect
to
be
distinguished
was
for
him
to
be
distinguished
on
the
easiest
terms
,
and
was
truly
grateful
for
being
so
openly
acknowledged
.
   
<EOS>
The
winter
passing
on
towards
the
spring
while
this
condition
of
affairs
prevailed
,
it
became
necessary
for
Mr
Sparkler
to
repair
to
England
,
and
take
his
appointed
part
in
the
expression
and
direction
of
its
genius
,
learning
,
commerce
,
spirit
,
and
sense
.
<EOS>
The
land
of
Shakespeare
,
Milton
,
Bacon
,
Newton
,
Watt
,
the
land
of
a
host
of
past
and
present
abstract
philosophers
,
natural
philosophers
,
and
subduers
of
Nature
and
Art
in
their
myriad
forms
,
called
to
Mr
Sparkler
to
come
and
take
care
of
it
,
lest
it
should
perish
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
,
unable
to
resist
the
agonised
cry
from
the
depths
of
his
country
's
soul
,
declared
that
he
must
go
.
   
<EOS>
It
followed
that
the
question
was
rendered
pressing
when
,
where
,
and
how
Mr
Sparkler
should
be
married
to
the
foremost
girl
in
all
this
world
with
no
nonsense
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
Its
solution
,
after
some
little
mystery
and
secrecy
,
Miss
Fanny
herself
announced
to
her
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now

my
child

said
she
,
seeking
her
out
one
day
,
"
I
am
going
to
tell
you
something

<EOS>
It
is
only
this
moment
broached

I
hurry
to
you
the
moment
it
IS
broached

<EOS>
My
precious
child
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
do
n't
anticipate
me
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
impart
my
confidence
to
you
,
you
flurried
little
thing
,
in
my
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
your
guess
,
if
I
answered
it
literally
,
I
should
answer
no
.
 
<EOS>
For
really
it
is
not
my
marriage
that
is
in
question
,
half
as
much
as
it
is
Edmund
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
looked
,
and
perhaps
not
altogether
without
cause
,
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
understand
this
fine
distinction
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
no
difficulty
,
"
exclaimed
Fanny
,
"
and
in
no
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
wanted
at
any
public
office
,
or
to
give
any
vote
anywhere
else
.
   
<EOS>
But
Edmund
is
.
 
<EOS>
And
Edmund
is
deeply
dejected
at
the
idea
of
going
away
by
himself
,
and
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
like
that
he
should
be
trusted
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
if
it
's
possible
---
and
it
generally
is
---
to
do
a
foolish
thing
,
he
is
sure
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
concluded
this
impartial
summary
of
the
reliance
that
might
be
safely
placed
upon
her
future
husband
,
she
took
off
,
with
an
air
of
business
,
the
bonnet
she
wore
,
and
dangled
it
by
its
strings
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
far
more
Edmund
's
question
,
therefore
,
than
mine
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
we
need
say
no
more
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
self
-
evident
on
the
face
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dearest
Amy
!
 
<EOS>
The
point
arising
,
is
he
to
go
by
himself
,
or
is
he
not
to
go
by
himself
<EOS>
,
this
other
point
arises
,
are
we
to
be
married
here
and
shortly
,
or
are
we
to
be
married
at
home
months
hence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
I
am
going
to
lose
you
,
Fanny
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
little
thing
you
are
,
"
cried
Fanny
,
half
tolerant
and
half
impatient
,
"
for
anticipating
one
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
my
darling
,
hear
me
out
.
<EOS>
That
woman
,
"
she
spoke
of
Mrs
Merdle
,
of
course
,
"
remains
here
until
after
Easter
;
so
,
in
the
case
of
my
being
married
here
and
going
to
London
with
Edmund
,
I
should
have
the
start
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
something
.
 
<EOS>
Further
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
That
woman
being
out
of
the
way
,
I
do
n't
know
that
I
greatly
object
to
Mr
Merdle
's
proposal
to
Pa
<EOS>
that
Edmund
<EOS>
and
I
should
take
up
our
abode
in
that
house
---
<EOS>
\you\
know
---
where
you
once
went
with
a
dancer
,
my
dear
,
until
our
own
house
can
be
chosen
and
fitted
up
.
 
<EOS>
Further
still
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
having
always
intended
to
go
to
town
himself
,
in
the
spring
,
---
you
see
,
if
Edmund
and
I
were
married
here
,
we
might
go
off
to
Florence
,
where
papa
might
join
us
,
and
we
might
all
three
travel
home
together
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
has
entreated
Pa
to
stay
with
him
in
that
same
mansion
I
have
mentioned
,
and
I
suppose
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
is
master
of
his
own
actions
;
and
upon
that
point
(
which
is
not
at
all
material
)
I
ca
n't
speak
positively
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
difference
between
papa
's
being
master
of
his
own
actions
and
Mr
Sparkler
's
being
nothing
of
the
sort
,
was
forcibly
expressed
by
Fanny
in
her
manner
of
stating
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
her
sister
noticed
it
;
for
she
was
divided
between
regret
at
the
coming
separation
,
and
a
lingering
wish
that
she
had
been
included
in
the
plans
for
visiting
England
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
these
are
the
arrangements
<EOS>
,
Fanny
dear
?
"
   
"
Arrangements
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
really
,
child
,
you
are
a
little
trying
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
particularly
guarded
myself
against
laying
my
words
open
to
any
such
construction
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
said
was
,
that
certain
questions
present
themselves
;
and
these
are
the
questions
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
's
thoughtful
eyes
met
hers
,
tenderly
and
quietly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
own
sweet
girl
,
"
said
Fanny
,
weighing
her
bonnet
by
the
strings
with
considerable
impatience
,
"
it
's
no
use
staring
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
owl
could
stare
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
to
you
for
advice
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
advise
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
"
asked
Little
Dorrit
,
persuasively
,
after
a
short
hesitation
,
"
do
you
think
,
Fanny
,
that
if
you
were
to
put
it
off
for
a
few
months
,
it
might
be
,
considering
all
things
,
best
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
little
Tortoise
,
"
retorted
Fanny
,
with
exceeding
sharpness
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
anything
of
the
kind
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
she
threw
her
bonnet
from
her
altogether
,
and
flounced
into
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
becoming
affectionate
almost
immediately
,
she
flounced
out
of
it
again
,
and
kneeled
down
on
the
floor
to
take
her
sister
,
chair
and
all
,
in
her
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
suppose
I
am
hasty
or
unkind
,
darling
,
because
I
really
am
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
are
such
a
little
oddity
!
 
<EOS>
You
make
one
bite
your
head
off
,
when
one
wants
to
be
soothing
beyond
everything
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
tell
you
,
you
dearest
baby
,
that
Edmund
ca
n't
be
trusted
by
himself
?
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
know
that
he
ca
n't
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
You
said
so
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
know
it
,
I
know
,
"
retorted
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
precious
child
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
is
not
to
be
trusted
by
himself
,
it
follows
,
I
suppose
,
that
I
should
go
with
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
---
seems
so
,
love
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
having
heard
the
arrangements
that
are
feasible
to
carry
out
that
object
,
am
I
to
understand
,
dearest
Amy
,
that
on
the
whole
you
advise
me
to
make
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
---
seems
so
,
love
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
cried
Fanny
with
an
air
of
resignation
,
"
then
I
suppose
it
must
be
done
!
 
<EOS>
I
came
to
you
,
my
sweet
,
the
moment
I
saw
the
doubt
,
and
the
necessity
of
deciding
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
decided
.
 
<EOS>
So
let
it
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
yielding
herself
up
,
in
this
pattern
manner
,
to
sisterly
advice
and
the
force
of
circumstances
,
Fanny
became
quite
benignant
:
as
one
who
had
laid
her
own
inclinations
at
the
feet
of
her
dearest
friend
,
and
felt
a
glow
of
conscience
in
having
made
the
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
my
Amy
,
"
she
said
to
her
sister
,
"
you
are
the
best
of
small
creatures
,
and
full
of
good
sense
;
and
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
ever
do
without
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
which
words
she
folded
her
in
a
closer
embrace
,
and
a
really
fond
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
contemplate
doing
without
You
,
Amy
,
by
any
means
,
for
I
hope
we
shall
ever
be
next
to
inseparable
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
pet
,
I
am
going
to
give
you
a
word
of
advice
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
are
left
alone
here
with
Mrs
General
---
"
   
"
I
am
to
be
left
alone
here
with
Mrs
General
?
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
quietly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
,
my
precious
,
till
papa
comes
back
!
 
<EOS>
Unless
you
call
Edward
company
,
which
he
certainly
is
not
,
even
when
he
is
here
,
and
still
more
certainly
is
not
when
he
is
away
at
Naples
or
in
Sicily
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
say
---
but
you
are
such
a
beloved
little
Marplot
for
putting
one
out
---
when
you
are
left
alone
here
with
Mrs
General
,
<EOS>
Amy
,
do
n't
you
let
her
slide
into
any
sort
of
artful
understanding
with
you
that
she
is
looking
after
Pa
,
or
that
Pa
is
looking
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
if
she
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
sly
manner
of
feeling
her
way
with
those
gloves
of
hers
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
comprehend
her
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
Pa
should
tell
you
when
he
comes
back
,
that
he
has
it
in
contemplation
to
make
Mrs
General
your
mama
(
which
is
not
the
less
likely
because
I
am
going
away
)
<EOS>
,
my
advice
to
you
is
,
that
you
say
at
once
,
"
Papa
,
I
beg
to
object
most
strongly
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
cautioned
me
about
this
,
and
she
objected
,
and
I
object
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
any
objection
from
you
,
Amy
,
is
likely
to
be
of
the
smallest
effect
,
or
that
I
think
you
likely
to
make
it
with
any
degree
of
firmness
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
principle
involved
---
a
filial
principle
---
<EOS>
and
I
implore
you
not
to
submit
to
be
mother
-
in
-
lawed
by
Mrs
General
,
without
asserting
it
in
making
every
one
about
you
as
uncomfortable
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
expect
you
to
stand
by
it
---
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
you
wo
n't
,
Pa
being
concerned
---
but
I
wish
to
rouse
you
to
a
sense
of
duty
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
any
help
from
me
,
or
as
to
any
opposition
that
I
can
offer
to
such
a
match
,
you
shall
not
be
left
in
the
lurch
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
weight
I
may
derive
from
my
position
as
a
married
girl
not
wholly
devoid
of
attractions
---
used
,
as
that
position
always
shall
be
,
to
oppose
that
woman
<EOS>
---
I
will
bring
to
bear
,
you
May
depend
upon
it
,
on
the
head
and
false
hair
<EOS>
(
for
I
am
confident
it
's
not
all
real
,
ugly
as
it
is
and
unlikely
as
it
appears
that
any
One
in
their
Senses
would
go
to
the
expense
of
buying
it
)
of
Mrs
General
!
"
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
received
this
counsel
without
venturing
to
oppose
it
but
without
giving
Fanny
any
reason
to
believe
that
she
intended
to
act
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Having
now
,
as
it
were
,
formally
wound
up
her
single
life
and
arranged
her
worldly
affairs
,
Fanny
proceeded
with
characteristic
ardour
to
prepare
for
the
serious
change
in
her
condition
.
   
<EOS>
The
preparation
consisted
in
the
despatch
of
her
maid
to
Paris
under
the
protection
of
the
Courier
,
for
the
purchase
of
that
outfit
for
a
bride
on
which
it
would
be
extremely
low
,
in
the
present
narrative
,
to
bestow
an
English
name
,
but
to
which
(
on
a
vulgar
principle
it
observes
of
adhering
to
the
language
in
which
it
professes
to
be
written
)
<EOS>
it
declines
to
give
a
French
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
rich
and
beautiful
wardrobe
purchased
by
these
agents
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
made
its
way
through
the
intervening
country
,
bristling
with
custom
-
houses
,
garrisoned
by
an
immense
army
of
shabby
mendicants
in
uniform
who
incessantly
repeated
the
Beggar
's
Petition
over
it
,
as
if
every
individual
warrior
among
them
were
the
ancient
Belisarius
:
and
of
whom
there
were
so
many
Legions
,
that
unless
the
Courier
had
expended
just
one
bushel
and
a
half
of
silver
money
relieving
their
distresses
,
they
would
have
worn
the
wardrobe
out
before
it
got
to
Rome
,
by
turning
it
over
and
over
.
<EOS>
Through
all
such
dangers
,
however
,
it
was
triumphantly
brought
,
inch
by
inch
,
and
arrived
at
its
journey
's
end
in
fine
condition
.
   
<EOS>
There
it
was
exhibited
to
select
companies
of
female
viewers
,
in
whose
gentle
bosoms
it
awakened
implacable
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
Concurrently
,
active
preparations
were
made
for
the
day
on
which
some
of
its
treasures
were
to
be
publicly
displayed
.
 
<EOS>
Cards
of
breakfast
-
invitation
were
sent
out
to
half
the
English
in
the
city
of
Romulus
;
the
other
half
made
arrangements
to
be
under
arms
,
as
criticising
volunteers
,
at
various
outer
points
of
the
solemnity
.
<EOS>
The
most
high
and
illustrious
English
Signor
Edgardo
Dorrit
,
came
post
through
the
deep
mud
and
ruts
(
from
forming
a
surface
under
the
improving
Neapolitan
nobility
)
,
to
grace
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
hotel
and
all
its
culinary
myrmidons
,
were
set
to
work
to
prepare
the
feast
.
 
<EOS>
The
drafts
of
Mr
Dorrit
almost
constituted
a
run
on
the
Torlonia
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
Consul
had
n't
had
such
a
marriage
in
the
whole
of
his
Consularity
.
   
<EOS>
The
day
came
,
and
the
She
-
Wolf
in
the
Capitol
might
have
snarled
with
envy
to
see
how
the
Island
Savages
contrived
these
things
now
-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
The
murderous
-
headed
statues
of
the
wicked
Emperors
of
the
Soldiery
,
whom
sculptors
had
not
been
able
to
flatter
out
of
their
villainous
hideousness
,
might
have
come
off
their
pedestals
to
run
away
with
the
Bride
.
 
<EOS>
The
choked
old
fountain
,
where
erst
the
gladiators
washed
,
might
have
leaped
into
life
again
to
honour
the
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
The
Temple
of
Vesta
might
have
sprung
up
anew
from
its
ruins
,
expressly
to
lend
its
countenance
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Might
have
done
;
but
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
Like
sentient
things
---
even
like
the
lords
and
ladies
of
creation
sometimes
---
might
have
done
much
,
but
did
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
The
celebration
went
off
with
admirable
pomp
;
monks
in
black
robes
,
white
robes
,
and
russet
robes
stopped
to
look
after
the
carriages
;
wandering
peasants
in
fleeces
of
sheep
,
begged
and
piped
under
the
house
-
windows
;
the
English
volunteers
defiled
;
the
day
wore
on
to
the
hour
of
vespers
;
the
festival
wore
away
;
the
thousand
churches
rang
their
bells
without
any
reference
to
it
;
and
St
Peter
denied
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
But
by
that
time
the
Bride
was
near
the
end
of
the
first
day
's
journey
towards
Florence
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
peculiarity
of
the
nuptials
that
they
were
all
Bride
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
noticed
the
Bridegroom
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
noticed
the
first
Bridesmaid
.
 
<EOS>
Few
could
have
seen
Little
Dorrit
(
who
held
that
post
)
for
the
glare
,
even
supposing
many
to
have
sought
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
Bride
had
mounted
into
her
handsome
chariot
,
incidentally
accompanied
by
the
Bridegroom
;
and
after
rolling
for
a
few
minutes
smoothly
over
a
fair
pavement
,
had
begun
to
jolt
through
a
Slough
of
Despond
,
and
through
a
long
,
long
avenue
of
wrack
and
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
Other
nuptial
carriages
are
said
to
have
gone
the
same
road
,
before
and
since
.
   
<EOS>
If
Little
Dorrit
found
herself
left
a
little
lonely
and
a
little
low
that
night
,
nothing
would
have
done
so
much
against
her
feeling
of
depression
as
the
being
able
to
sit
at
work
by
her
father
,
as
in
the
old
time
,
and
help
him
to
his
supper
and
his
rest
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
now
,
when
they
sat
in
the
state
-
equipage
with
Mrs
General
on
the
coach
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
supper
!
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Dorrit
had
wanted
supper
,
there
was
an
Italian
cook
and
there
was
a
Swiss
confectioner
,
who
must
have
put
on
caps
as
high
as
the
Pope
's
Mitre
,
and
have
performed
the
mysteries
of
Alchemists
in
a
copper
-
saucepaned
laboratory
below
,
before
he
could
have
got
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
sententious
and
didactic
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
simply
loving
,
he
would
have
done
Little
Dorrit
more
good
;
but
she
accepted
him
as
he
was
---
when
had
she
not
accepted
him
as
he
was
!
<EOS>
---
and
made
the
most
and
best
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
at
length
retired
.
<EOS>
Her
retirement
for
the
night
was
always
her
frostiest
ceremony
,
as
if
she
felt
it
necessary
that
the
human
imagination
should
be
chilled
into
stone
to
prevent
its
following
her
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
gone
through
her
rigid
preliminaries
,
amounting
to
a
sort
of
genteel
platoon
-
exercise
,
she
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
then
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
her
father
's
neck
,
to
bid
him
good
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
,
"
this
is
the
close
of
a
day
,
that
has
---
ha
---
greatly
impressed
and
gratified
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
A
little
tired

too

"
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
<EOS>
no

arises

occasion
<EOS>
so

"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
was
glad
to
find
him
in
such
heart
,
and
smiled
from
her
own
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
My

"
he
continued
,
"
this
is
an

With

"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
fluttered
by
his
words
,
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
though
he
stopped
as
if
he
expected
her
to
say
something
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
"
he
resumed
;
"
your

I

She
said
it
like
one
in
sudden
alarm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nay

said
Mr

he
added
after
a
moment
,

O

a

of
day
at
which

that
profession
of
self

at

I

<EOS>
If
the
thought
ever
entered
Little
Dorrit
's
head
that
night
,
that
he
could
give
her
up
lightly
now
in
his
prosperity
,
and
when
he
had
it
in
his
mind
to
replace
her
with
a
second
wife
,
she
drove
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
Faithful
to
him
<EOS>
still
,
as
in
the
worst
times
through
which
she
had
borne
him
single
-
handed
,
she
drove
the
thought
away
;
and
entertained
no
harder
reflection
,
in
her
tearful
unrest
,
than
that
he
now
saw
everything
through
their
wealth
,
and
through
the
care
he
always
had
upon
him
that
they
should
continue
rich
,
and
grow
richer
.
   
<EOS>
They
sat
in
their
equipage
of
state
,
with
Mrs
General
on
the
box
,
for
three
weeks
longer
,
and
then
he
started
for
Florence
to
join
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
would
have
been
glad
to
bear
him
company
so
far
,
only
for
the
sake
of
her
own
love
,
and
then
to
have
turned
back
alone
,
thinking
of
dear
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
though
the
Courier
had
gone
on
with
the
Bride
,
the
Valet
was
next
in
the
line
;
and
the
succession
would
not
have
come
to
her
,
as
long
as
any
one
could
be
got
for
money
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
took
life
easily
---
as
easily
,
that
is
,
as
she
could
take
anything
---
when
the
Roman
establishment
remained
in
their
sole
occupation
;
and
Little
Dorrit
would
often
ride
out
in
a
hired
carriage
that
was
left
them
,
and
alight
alone
and
wander
among
the
ruins
of
old
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
The
ruins
of
the
vast
old
Amphitheatre
,
of
the
old
Temples
,
of
the
old
commemorative
Arches
,
of
the
old
trodden
highways
,
of
the
old
tombs
,
besides
being
what
they
were
,
to
her
were
ruins
of
the
old
Marshalsea
---
ruins
of
her
own
old
life
---
ruins
of
the
faces
and
forms
that
of
old
peopled
it
---
ruins
of
its
loves
,
hopes
,
cares
,
and
joys
.
 
<EOS>
Two
ruined
spheres
of
action
and
suffering
were
before
the
solitary
girl
often
sitting
on
some
broken
fragment
;
and
in
the
lonely
places
,
under
the
blue
sky
,
she
saw
them
both
together
.
   
<EOS>
Up
,
then
,
would
come
Mrs
General
;
taking
all
the
colour
out
of
everything
,
as
Nature
and
Art
had
taken
it
out
of
herself
;
writing
Prunes
and
Prism
,
in
Mr
Eustace
's
text
,
wherever
she
could
lay
a
hand
;
looking
everywhere
for
Mr
Eustace
and
company
,
and
seeing
nothing
else
;
scratching
up
the
driest
little
bones
of
antiquity
,
and
bolting
them
whole
without
any
human
visitings
---
like
a
Ghoule

<EOS>
Getting
on
 
The
newly
married
pair
,
on
their
arrival
in
Harley
Street
,
Cavendish
Square
,
London
,
were
received
by
the
Chief
Butler
.
 
<EOS>
That
great
man
was
not
interested
in
them
,
but
on
the
whole
endured
them
.
 
<EOS>
People
must
continue
to
be
married
and
given
in
marriage
,
or
Chief
Butlers
would
not
be
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
As
nations
are
made
to
be
taxed
,
so
families
are
made
to
be
butlered
.
 
<EOS>
The
Chief
Butler
,
no
doubt
,
reflected
that
the
course
of
nature
required
the
wealthy
population
to
be
kept
up
,
on
his
account
.
   
<EOS>
He
therefore
condescended
to
look
at
the
carriage
from
the
Hall
-
door
without
frowning
at
it
,
and
said
,
in
a
very
handsome
way
,
to
one
of
his
men
,
"
<EOS>
Thomas
,
help
with
the
luggage
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
even
escorted
the
Bride
up
-
stairs
into
Mr
Merdle
's
presence
;
but
this
must
be
considered
as
an
act
of
homage
to
the
sex
(
of
which
he
was
an
admirer
,
being
notoriously
captivated
by
the
charms
of
a
certain
Duchess
)
,
and
not
as
a
committal
of
himself
with
the
family
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
was
slinking
about
the
hearthrug
,
waiting
to
welcome
Mrs
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
His
hand
seemed
to
retreat
up
his
sleeve
as
he
advanced
to
do
so
,
and
he
gave
her
such
a
superfluity
of
coat
-
cuff
that
it
was
like
being
received
by
the
popular
conception
of
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
When
he
put
his
lips
to
hers
,
besides
,
he
took
himself
into
custody
by
the
wrists
,
and
backed
himself
among
the
ottomans
and
chairs
and
tables
as
if
he
were
his
own
Police
officer
,
saying
to
himself
,
"
Now
,
none
of
that
!
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
got
you
,
you
know
,
and
you
go
quietly
along
with
me
!

<EOS>
Mrs
Sparkler
,
installed
in
the
rooms
of
state
---
the
innermost
sanctuary
of
down
,
silk
,
chintz
,
and
fine
linen
---
felt
that
so
far
her
triumph
was
good
,
and
her
way
made
,
step
by
step
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
before
her
marriage
,
she
had
bestowed
on
Mrs
Merdle
's
maid
with
an
air
of
gracious
indifference
,
in
Mrs
Merdle
's
presence
,
a
trifling
little
keepsake
(
bracelet
,
bonnet
,
and
two
dresses
,
all
new
)
about
four
times
as
valuable
as
the
present
formerly
made
by
Mrs
Merdle
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
now
established
in
Mrs
Merdle
's
own
rooms
,
to
which
some
extra
touches
had
been
given
to
render
them
more
worthy
of
her
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
mind
's
eye
,
as
she
lounged
there
,
surrounded
by
every
luxurious
accessory
that
wealth
could
obtain
or
invention
devise
,
she
saw
the
fair
bosom
that
beat
in
unison
with
the
exultation
of
her
thoughts
,
competing
with
the
bosom
that
had
been
famous
so
long
,
outshining
it
,
and
deposing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Happy
?
 
<EOS>
Fanny
must
have
been
happy
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
wishing
one

<EOS>
The
Courier
had
not
approved
of
Mr
Dorrit
's
staying
in
the
house
of
a
friend
,
and
had
preferred
to
take
him
to
an
hotel
in
Brook
Street
,
Grosvenor
Square
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
ordered
his
carriage
to
be
ready
early
in
the
morning
that
he
might
wait
upon
Mr
Dorrit
immediately
after
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Bright
the
carriage
looked

sleek
the

looked

gleaming
the

looked

luscious

the

looked

A

An

Early
people
looked
after
it
as
it
rattled
along
the
streets
,
and
said
,
with
awe
in
their
breath
,
"
There
he
goes
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
he
went
,
until
Brook
Street
stopped
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
forth
from
its
magnificent
case
came
the
jewel
;
not
lustrous
in
itself
,
but
quite
the
contrary
.
   
<EOS>
Commotion
in
the
office
of
the
hotel

<EOS>
Merdle

The
landlord
,
though
a
gentleman
of
a
haughty
spirit
who
had
just
driven
a
pair
of
thorough
-
bred
horses
into
town
,
turned
out
to
show
him
up

stairs
.
<EOS>
The
clerks
and
servants
cut
him
off
by
back

passages
,
and
were
found
accidentally
hovering
in
doorways
and
angles
,
that
they
might
look
upon
him

The
man
who
could
have
any
one
he
chose
to
dine
with
him
,
and
who
had
made
the
money
!
   
<EOS>
As
he
went
up
the
stairs
,
people
were
already
posted
on
the
lower
stairs
,
that
his
shadow
might
fall
upon
them
when
he
came
down
.
 
<EOS>
So
were
the
sick
brought
out
and
laid
in
the
track
of
the
Apostle

who

NOT

Mr
Dorrit
,
dressing
<EOS>
-
gowned
and
newspapered
,
was
at
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
The
Courier
,
with
agitation
in
his
voice
,
announced
"
Miss
Mairdale
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
's
overwrought
heart
bounded
as
he
leaped
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
,
this
is
---
ha
---
indeed
an
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
express
the
---
hum

sense
,
the
high
sense
,
I
entertain
of
this
---
ha
hum
---
highly
gratifying
act
of
attention
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
well
aware
,
sir
,
of
the
many
demands
upon
your
time
,
and
its
---
ha
---
enormous
value
,
"
Mr
Dorrit
could
not
say
enormous
roundly
enough
for
his
own
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
should
---
ha
---
at
this
early
hour
,
bestow
any
of
your
priceless
time
upon
me
,
is
---
ha
---
a
compliment
that
I
acknowledge
with
the
greatest
esteem
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
positively
trembled
in
addressing
the
great
man
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
uttered
,
in
his
subdued
,
inward
,
hesitating
voice
,
a
few
sounds
that
were
to
no
purpose
whatever
;
and
finally
said
,
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Truly
kind
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
visitor
was
seated
,
and
was
passing
his
great
hand
over
his
exhausted
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
well
,
I
hope
,
Mr
Merdle
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
well
as
I
---
<EOS>
yes
,
I
am
as
well
as
I
usually
am
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
occupations
must
be
immense
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
Tolerably
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
---
Oh
dear
no
,
there
's
not
much
the
matter
with
me
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
looking
round
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
dyspeptic
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
hinted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
---
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
am
well
enough
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
black
traces
on
his
lips
where
they
met
,
as
if
a
little
train
of
gunpowder
had
been
fired
there
;
and
he
looked
like
a
man
who
,
if
his
natural
temperament
had
been
quicker
,
would
have
been
very
feverish
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
and
his
heavy
way
of
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
,
had
prompted
Mr
Dorrit
's
solicitous
inquiries
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
Mr
Dorrit
insinuatingly
pursued
,
"
I
left
,
as
you
will
be
prepared
to
hear
,
the
---
ha
---
observed
of
all
observers
,
the
---
hum

admired
of
all
admirers
,
the
leading
fascination
and
charm
of
Society
in
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
looking
wonderfully
well
when
I
quitted
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Merdle
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
is
generally
considered
a
very
attractive
woman
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
is
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sensible
of
her
being
SO
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
can
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
"
responded
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
turned
his
tongue
in
his
closed
mouth
---
it
seemed
rather
a
stiff
and
unmanageable
tongue
---
moistened
his
lips
,
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
again
,
and
looked
all
round
the
room
again
,
principally
under
the
chairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
said
,
looking
Mr
Dorrit
in
the
face
for
the
first
time
,
and
immediately
afterwards
dropping
his
eyes
to
the
buttons
of
Mr
Dorrit
's
waistcoat
;
"
if
we
speak
of
attractions
,
your
daughter
ought
to
be
the
subject
of
our
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
extremely
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
Both
in
face
and
figure
,
she
is
quite
uncommon
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
young
people
arrived
last
night
,
I
was
really
surprised
to
see
such
charms
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
's
gratification
was
such
that
he
said
---
ha
---
he
could
not
refrain
from
telling
Mr
Merdle
verbally
,
as
he
had
already
done
by
letter
,
what
honour
and
happiness
he
felt
in
this
union
of
their
families
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
offered
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
looked
at
the
hand
for
a
little
while
,
took
it
on
his
for
a
moment
as
if
his
were
a
yellow
salver
or
fish
-
slice
,
and
then
returned
it
to
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
would
drive
round
the
first
thing
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
to
offer
my
services
,
in
case
I
can
do
anything
for
you
;
and
to
say
that
I
hope
you
will
at
least
do
me
the
honour
of
dining
with
me
to
-
day
,
and
every
day
when
you
are
not
better
engaged
during
your
stay
in
town
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
was
enraptured
by
these
attentions
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
stay
long
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
at
present
the
intention
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
of
 
---
ha
---
exceeding
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
very
short
stay
,
after
so
long
a
journey
,
"
returned
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hum
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
truth
is
---
ha
---
my
dear
Mr
Merdle
,
that
I
find
a
foreign
life
so
well
suited
to
my
health
and
taste
,
that
I
---
hum
---
have
but
<EOS>
two
objects
in
my
present
visit
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
the
---
ha
---
the
distinguished
happiness
and
---
ha
 
---
privilege
which
I
now
enjoy
and
appreciate
;
secondly
,
the
arrangement
---
hum
---
the
laying
out
,
that
is
to
say
,
in
the
best
way
,
of
---
ha
,
hum
---
my
money
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
after
turning
his
tongue
again
,
"
if
I
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
in
that
respect
,
you
may
command
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
's
speech
had
had
more
hesitation
in
it
than
usual
,
as
he
approached
the
ticklish
topic
,
for
he
was
not
perfectly
clear
how
so
exalted
a
potentate
might
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
doubts
whether
reference
to
any
individual
capital
,
or
fortune
,
might
not
seem
a
wretchedly
retail
affair
to
so
wholesale
a
dealer
.
 
<EOS>
Greatly
relieved
by
Mr
Merdle
's
affable
offer
of
assistance
,
he
caught
at
it
directly
,
and
heaped
acknowledgments
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
---
ha
---
dared
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
I
assure
you
,
to
hope
for
so
---
hum
---
vast
an
advantage
as
your
direct
advice
and
assistance
.
<EOS>
Though
of
course
I
should
,
under
any
circumstances
,
like
the
---
ha
,
hum
---
rest
of
the
civilised
world
,
have
followed
in
Mr
Merdle
's
train
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
we
may
almost
say
we
are
related
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
curiously
interested
in
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
,
"
and
,
therefore
,
you
may
consider
me
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
.
 
<EOS>
Very
handsome
,
indeed
!
"
cried
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
.
 
<EOS>
Most
handsome
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
it
would
not
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
be
at
the
present
moment
easy
for
what
I
may
call
a
mere
outsider
to
come
into
any
of
the
good
things
---
of
course
I
speak
of
my
own
good
things
---
"
   
"
Of
course
,
of
course
!
"
cried
Mr
Dorrit
,
in
a
tone
implying
that
there
were
no
other
good
things
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
---
Unless
at
a
high
price
.
 
<EOS>
At
what
we
are
accustomed
to
term
a
very
long
figure
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
laughed
in
the
buoyancy
of
his
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Long
figure
.
 
<EOS>
Good
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
.
 
<EOS>
Very
expressive
to
be
sure
!
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
I
do
generally
retain
in
my
own
hands
the
power
of
exercising
some
preference
<EOS>
---
people
in
general
would
be
pleased
to
call
it
favour
---
as
a
sort
of
compliment
for
my
care
and
trouble
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
public
spirit
and
genius
,
"
Mr
Dorrit
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
,
with
a
dry
,
swallowing
action
,
seemed
to
dispose
of
those
qualities
like
a
bolus
;
then
added
,
"
As
a
sort
of
return
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
see
,
if
you
please
,
how
I
can
exert
this
limited
power
(
for
people
are
jealous
,
and
it
is
limited
)
,
to
your
advantage
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
"
replied
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
there
must
be
the
strictest
integrity
and
uprightness
in
these
transactions
;
there
must
be
the
purest
faith
between
man
and
man
;
there
must
be
unimpeached
and
unimpeachable
confidence
;
or
business
could
not
be
carried
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
hailed
these
generous
sentiments
with
fervour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
I
can
only
give
you
a
preference
to
a
certain
extent
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
.
 
<EOS>
To
a
defined
extent
,
"
observed
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Defined
extent
.
 
<EOS>
And
perfectly
above
-
board
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
my
advice
,
however
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
that
is
another
matter
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
such
as
it
is
---
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Such
as
it
was
!
 
<EOS>
(
Mr
Dorrit
could
not
bear
the
faintest
appearance
of
its
being
depreciated
,
even
by
Mr
Merdle
himself
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
---
That
,
there
is
nothing
in
the
bonds
of
spotless
honour
between
myself
and
my
fellow
-
man
to
prevent
my
parting
with
,
if
I
choose
.
<EOS>
And
that
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
now
deeply
intent
upon
a
dust
-
cart
that
was
passing
the
windows
,
"
shall
be
at
your
command
whenever
you
think
proper
.
"
   
<EOS>
New
acknowledgments
from
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
New
passages
of
Mr
Merdle
's
hand
over
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
Calm
and
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Contemplation
of
Mr
Dorrit
's
waistcoat
buttons
by
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
time
being
rather
precious
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
suddenly
getting
up
,
as
if
he
had
been
waiting
in
the
interval
for
his
legs
<EOS>
and
they
had
just
come
,
"
I
must
be
moving
towards
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
Can
I
take
you
anywhere
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
happy
to
set
you
down
,
or
send
you
on
.
<EOS>
My
carriage
is
at
your
disposal
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
bethought
himself
that
he
had
business
at
his
banker
's
.
<EOS>
His
banker
's
was
in
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
fortunate
;
Mr
Merdle
would
take
him
into
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
surely
,
he
might
not
detain
Mr
Merdle
while
he
assumed
his
coat
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
might
and
must
;
Mr
Merdle
insisted
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Dorrit
,
retiring
into
the
next
room
,
put
himself
under
the
hands
of
his
valet
,
and
in
five
minutes
came
back
glorious
.
   
<EOS>
Then
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
Allow
me
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Take
my
arm
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
leaning
on
Mr
Merdle
's
arm
,
did
Mr
Dorrit
descend
the
staircase
,
seeing
the
worshippers
on
the
steps
,
and
feeling
that
the
light
of
Mr
Merdle
shone
by
reflection
in
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
carriage
,
and
the
ride
into
the
City
;
and
the
people
who
looked
at
them
;
and
the
hats
that
flew
off
grey
heads
;
and
the
general
bowing
and
crouching
before
this
wonderful
mortal
the
like
of
which
prostration
of
spirit
was
not
to
be
seen
---
<EOS>
no
,
by
high
Heaven
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
worth
thinking
of
by
Fawners
of
all
denominations
---
in
Westminster
Abbey
and
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
put
together
,
on
any
Sunday
in
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
rapturous
dream
to
Mr
Dorrit
to
find
himself
set
aloft
in
this
public
car
of
triumph
,
making
a
magnificent
progress
to
that
befitting
destination
,
the
golden
Street
of
the
Lombards
.
   
<EOS>
There
Mr
Merdle
insisted
on
alighting
and
going
his
way
a
-
foot
,
and
leaving
his
poor
equipage
at
Mr
Dorrit
's
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
dream
increased
in
rapture
when
Mr
Dorrit
came
out
of
the
bank
alone
,
and
people
looked
at
him
in
default
of
Mr
Merdle
,
and
when
,
with
the
ears
of
his
mind
,
he
heard
the
frequent
exclamation
as
he
rolled
glibly
along
,
"
A
wonderful
man
to
be
Mr
Merdle
's
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
dinner
that
day
,
although
the
occasion
was
not
foreseen
and
provided
for
,
a
brilliant
company
of
such
as
are
not
made
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
,
but
of
some
superior
article
for
the
present
unknown
,
shed
their
lustrous
benediction
upon
Mr
Dorrit
's
daughter
's
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Dorrit
's
daughter
that
day
began
,
in
earnest
,
her
competition
with
that
woman
not
present
;
and
began
it
so
well
that
Mr
Dorrit
could
all
but
have
taken
his
affidavit
,
if
required
,
that
Mrs
Sparkler
had
all
her
life
been
lying
at
full
length
in
the
lap
of
luxury
,
and
had
never
heard
of
such
a
rough
word
in
the
English
tongue
as
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
Next
day
,
and
the
day
after
,
and
every
day
,
all
graced
by
more
dinner
company
,
cards
descended
on
Mr
Dorrit
like
theatrical
snow
.
<EOS>
As
the
friend
and
relative
by
marriage
of
the
illustrious
Merdle
,
Bar
,
Bishop
,
Treasury
,
Chorus
,
Everybody
,
wanted
to
make
or
improve
Mr
Dorrit
's
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
In
Mr
Merdle
's
heap
of
offices
in
the
City
,
when
Mr
Dorrit
appeared
at
any
of
them
on
his
business
taking
him
Eastward
(
which
it
frequently
did
,
for
it
throve
amazingly
)
,
the
name
of
Dorrit
was
always
a
passport
to
the
great
presence
of
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
dream
increased
in
rapture
every
hour
,
as
Mr
Dorrit
felt
increasingly
sensible
that
this
connection
had
brought
him
forward
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
Only
one
thing
sat
otherwise
than
auriferously
,
and
at
the
same
time
lightly
,
on
Mr
Dorrit
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
Chief
Butler
.
 
<EOS>
That
stupendous
character
looked
at
him
,
in
the
course
of
his
official
looking
at
the
dinners
,
in
a
manner
that
Mr
Dorrit
considered
questionable
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
him
,
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
and
up
the
staircase
,
going
to
dinner
,
with
a
glazed
fixedness
that
Mr
Dorrit
did
not
like
.
 
<EOS>
Seated
at
table
in
the
act
of
drinking
,
Mr
Dorrit
still
saw
him
through
his
wine
-
glass
,
regarding
him
with
a
cold
and
ghostly
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
misgave
him
that
the
Chief
Butler
must
have
known
a
Collegian
,
and
must
have
seen
him
in
the
College
---
perhaps
had
been
presented
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
as
closely
at
the
Chief
Butler
as
such
a
man
could
be
looked
at
,
and
yet
he
did
not
recall
that
he
had
ever
seen
him
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Ultimately
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
there
was
no
reverence
in
the
man
,
no
sentiment
in
the
great
creature
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
relieved
by
that
;
for
,
let
him
think
what
he
would
,
the
Chief
Butler
had
him
in
his
supercilious
eye
,
even
when
that
eye
was
on
the
plate
and
other
table
-
garniture
;
and
he
never
let
him
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
hint
to
him
that
this
confinement
in
his
eye
was
disagreeable
,
or
to
ask
him
what
he
meant
,
was
an
act
too
daring
to
venture
upon
;
his
severity
with
his
employers
and
their
visitors
being
terrific
,
and
he
never
permitting
himself
to
be
approached
with
the
slightest
liberty
.

Missing
 
<EOS>
The
term
of
Mr
Dorrit
's
visit
was
within
two
days
of
being
out
,
and
he
was
about
to
dress
for
another
inspection
by
the
Chief
Butler
(
whose
victims
were
always
dressed
expressly
for
him
)
,
when
one
of
the
servants
of
the
hotel
presented
himself
bearing
a
card
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
taking
it
,
read
:
   
"
Mrs
Finching
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
servant
waited
in
speechless
deference
.
   
<EOS>
"
Man
,
man
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
turning
upon
him
with
grievous
indignation
,
"
explain
your
motive
in
bringing
me
this
ridiculous
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
wholly
unacquainted
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Finching
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
perhaps
avenging
himself
on
the
Chief
Butler
by
Substitute
.
   
<EOS>
"
ha
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
Finching
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
,
man
,
seemed
to
mean
Flinching
as
much
as
anything
else
,
for
he
backed
away
from
Mr
Dorrit
's
severe
regard
,
as
he
replied
,
"
A
lady
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
such
lady
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
this
card
away
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
Finching
of
either
sex
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
said
she
was
aware
she
might
be
unknown
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
begged
me
to
say
,
sir
,
that
she
had
formerly
the
honour
of
being
acquainted
with
Miss
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
said
,
sir
,
the
youngest
Miss
Dorrit
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
knitted
his
brows
and
rejoined
,
after
a
moment
or
two
,
"
Inform
Mrs
Finching
,
sir
,
"
emphasising
the
name
as
if
the
innocent
man
were
solely
responsible
for
it
,
"
that
she
can
come
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
reflected
,
in
his
momentary
pause
,
that
unless
she
were
admitted
she
might
leave
some
message
,
or
might
say
something
below
,
having
a
disgraceful
reference
to
that
former
state
of
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
the
concession
,
and
hence
the
appearance
of
Flora
,
piloted
in
by
the
man
,
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
pleasure
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
standing
with
the
card
in
his
hand
,
and
with
an
air
which
imported
that
it
would
scarcely
have
been
a
first
-
class
pleasure
if
he
had
had
it
,
"
of
knowing
either
this
name
,
or
yourself
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
Place
a
chair
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
responsible
man
,
with
a
start
,
obeyed
,
and
went
out
on
tiptoe
.
<EOS>
Flora
,
putting
aside
her
veil
with
a
bashful
tremor
upon
her
,
proceeded
to
introduce
herself
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
a
singular
combination
of
perfumes
was
diffused
through
the
room
,
as
if
some
brandy
had
been
put
by
mistake
in
a
lavender
-
water
bottle
,
or
as
if
some
lavender
-
water
had
been
put
by
mistake
in
a
brandy
-
bottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
Mr
Dorrit
to
offer
a
thousand
apologies
and
indeed
they
would
be
far
too
few
for
such
an
intrusion
<EOS>
which
I
know
must
appear
extremely
bold
in
a
lady
and
alone
too
,
but
I
thought
it
best
upon
the
whole
however
difficult
and
even
apparently
improper
though
Mr
F
's
Aunt
would
have
willingly
accompanied
me
and
as
a
character
of
great
force
and
spirit
would
probably
have
struck
one
possessed
of
such
a
knowledge
of
life
as
no
doubt
with
so
many
changes
must
have
been
acquired
,
for
Mr
F
himself
said
frequently
that
although
well
educated
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Blackheath
at
as
high
as
eighty
guineas
which
is
a
good
deal
for
parents
and
the
plate
kept
back
too
on
going
away
<EOS>
but
that
is
more
a
meanness
than
its
value
that
he
had
learnt
more
in
his
first
years
as
a
commercial
traveller
with
a
large
commission
on
the
sale
of
an
article
that
nobody
would
hear
of
much
less
buy
which
preceded
the
wine
trade
a
long
time
than
in
the
whole
six
years
in
that
academy
conducted
by
a
college
Bachelor
,
though
why
a
Bachelor
more
clever
than
a
married
man
I
do
not
see
and
never
did
but
pray
excuse
me
that
is
not
the
point
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
stood
rooted
to
the
carpet
,
a
statue
of
mystification
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
openly
admit
that
I
have
no
pretensions
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
but
having
known
the
dear
little
thing
which
under
altered
circumstances
appears
a
liberty
but
is
not
so
intended

Goodness
knows
there
was
no
favour

quite
the
other

said
Mr

,
recovering
his
breath
by
a
great
effort
,
as
the
relict
of
the
late
Mr
Finching
stopped
to
take
hers
;
"

said
Mr

,
very
red
in
the
face
,

returned
Flora

would
not
have
mentioned
it
on
any
account

as
supposing
it
a
favourable
and

"
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
backed
to
his
chair
in
a
stony
way
,
and
seated
himself
,
as
Flora
gave
him
a
softening
look
and
played
with
her
parasol
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
dear

said
Flora
,
"

gone
off

white

cold

a

morning

At
the
mention
of
these
two
names
,
Mr

frowned
,
stared
,
frowned
again
,
hesitated
with
his
fingers
at
his
lips

as
he
had
hesitated
long
ago

said
,

more
stately
I
perceive
a

filled
out

a

still

the
object

<EOS>
Mr

,
without
greatly
regarding
the
earnestness
of
these
latter
words
,
repeated
,
"
State

<EOS>
"
It

not

said
Flora
,

it

the
gratification

Allow

repeated

with

desperation

not
referring

<EOS>
some

are
wicked
enough
to
whisper

what
the
uneasiness

quite
unable

overcome
it

can
not
fail

<EOS>
It
happened
,
fortunately
for
the
elucidation
of
any
intelligible
result
,
that
Mr
Dorrit
had
heard
or
read
nothing
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
This
caused
Mrs
Finching
,
with
many
apologies
for
being
in
great
practical
difficulties
as
to
finding
the
way
to
her
pocket
among
the
stripes
of
her
dress
at
length
to
produce
a
police
handbill
,
setting
forth
that
a
foreign
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Blandois
,
last
from
Venice
,
had
unaccountably
disappeared
on
such
a
night
in
such
a
part
of
the
city
of
London
;
that
he
was
known
to
have
entered
such
a
house
,
at
such
an
hour
;
that
he
was
stated
by
the
inmates
of
that
house
to
have
left
it
,
about
so
many
minutes
before
midnight
;
and
that
he
had
never
been
beheld
since
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
with
exact
particulars
of
time
and
locality
,
and
with
a
good
detailed
description
of
the
foreign
gentleman
who
had
so
mysteriously
vanished
,
Mr

read
at
large
.

I
believe
you
have
referred
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
---
ha
---
that
person
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
different
person
indeed
,
"
replied
Flora
,
"
with
no
limbs
and
wheels
instead
and
the
grimmest
of
women
though
his
mother
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clennam
and
<EOS>
Co.
 
a
---
hum
---
a
mother
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
an
old
man
besides
,
"
said
Flora
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
looked
as
if
he
must
immediately
be
driven
out
of
his
mind
by
this
account
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
was
it
rendered
more
favourable
to
sanity
by
Flora
's
dashing
into
a
rapid
analysis
of
Mr
Flintwinch
's
cravat
,
and
describing
him
,
without
the
lightest
boundary
line
of
separation
between
his
identity
and
Mrs
Clennam
's
,
as
a
rusty
screw
in
gaiters
.
 
<EOS>
Which
compound
of
man
and
woman
,
no
limbs
,
wheels
,
rusty
screw
,
grimness
,
and
gaiters
,
so
completely
stupefied
Mr
Dorrit
,
that
he
was
a
spectacle
to
be
pitied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
would
not
detain
you
one
moment
longer
,
"
said
Flora
,
upon
whom
his
condition
wrought
its
effect
,
though
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
having
produced
it
,
"
if
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
give
your
promise
as
a
gentleman
that
both
in
going
back
to
Italy
and
in
Italy
too
you
would
look
for
this
Mr
Blandois
high
and
low
and
if
you
found
or
heard
of
him
make
him
come
forward
for
the
clearing
of
all
parties
.
<EOS>
"
By
that
time
Mr
Dorrit
had
so
far
recovered
from
his
bewilderment
,
as
to
be
able
to
say
,
in
a
tolerably
connected
manner
,
that
he
should
consider
that
his
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
was
delighted
with
her
success
,
and
rose
to
take
her
leave
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
a
million
thanks
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
my
address
upon
my
card
in
case
of
anything
to
be
communicated
personally
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
send
my
love
to
the
dear
little
thing
for
it
might
not
be
acceptable
,
and
indeed
there
is
no
dear
little
thing
left
in
the
transformation
<EOS>
so
why
do
it
but
both
myself
and
Mr
F
's
Aunt
ever
wish
her
well
and
lay
no
claim
to
any
favour
on
our
side
<EOS>
you
may
be
sure
of
that
but
<EOS>
quite
the
other
way
for
what
she
undertook
to
do
she
did
and
that
is
more
than
a
great
many
of
us
do
,
not
to
say
anything
of
her
doing
it
as
Well
as
it
could
be
done
and
<EOS>
I
myself
am
one
of
them
for
I
have
said
ever
since
I
began
to
recover
the
blow
of
Mr
F
's
death
that
I
would
learn
the
Organ
of
which
I
am
extremely
fond
but
of
which
I
am
ashamed
to
say
I
do
not
yet
know
a
note
,
good
evening
!
"
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
Dorrit
,
who
attended
her
to
the
room
-
door
,
had
had
a
little
time
to
collect
his
senses
,
he
found
that
the
interview
had
summoned
back
discarded
reminiscences
which
jarred
with
the
Merdle
dinner
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrote
and
sent
off
a
brief
note
excusing
himself
for
that
day
,
and
ordered
dinner
presently
in
his
own
rooms
at
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
another
reason
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
His
time
in
London
was
very
nearly
out
,
and
was
anticipated
by
engagements
;
his
plans
were
made
for
returning
;
and
he
thought
it
behoved
his
importance
to
pursue
some
direct
inquiry
into
the
Blandois
disappearance
,
and
be
in
a
condition
to
carry
back
to
Mr
Henry
Gowan
the
result
of
his
own
personal
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
resolved
that
he
would
take
advantage
of
that
evening
's
freedom
to
go
down
to
Clennam
and
Co
's
,
easily
to
be
found
by
the
direction
set
forth
in
the
handbill
;
and
see
the
place
,
and
ask
a
question
or
two
there
himself
.
   
<EOS>
Having
dined
as
plainly
as
the
establishment
and
the
Courier
would
let
him
,
and
having
taken
a
short
sleep
by
the
fire
for
his
better
recovery
from
Mrs
Finching
,
he
set
out
in
a
hackney
-
cabriolet
alone
.
 
<EOS>
The
deep
bell
of
St
Paul
's
was
striking
nine
as
he
passed
under
the
shadow
of
Temple
Bar
,
headless
and
forlorn
in
these
degenerate
days
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
approached
his
destination
through
the
by
-
streets
and
water
-
side
ways
,
that
part
of
London
seemed
to
him
an
uglier
spot
at
such
an
hour
than
he
had
ever
supposed
it
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Many
long
years
had
passed
since
he
had
seen
it
;
he
had
never
known
much
of
it
;
and
it
wore
a
mysterious
and
dismal
aspect
in
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
So
powerfully
was
his
imagination
impressed
by
it
,
that
when
his
driver
stopped
,
after
having
asked
the
way
more
than
once
,
and
said
to
the
best
of
his
belief
this
was
the
gateway
they
wanted
,
Mr
Dorrit
stood
hesitating
,
with
the
coach
-
door
in
his
hand
,
half
afraid
of
the
dark
look
of
the
place
.
   
<EOS>
Truly
,
it
looked
as
gloomy
that
night
as
even
it
had
ever
looked
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
handbills
were
posted
on
the
entrance
wall
,
one
on
either
side
,
and
as
the
lamp
flickered
in
the
night
air
,
shadows
passed
over
them
,
not
unlike
the
shadows
of
fingers
following
the
lines
.
 
<EOS>
A
watch
was
evidently
kept
upon
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Dorrit
paused
,
a
man
passed
in
from
over
the
way
,
and
another
man
passed
out
from
some
dark
corner
within
;
and
both
looked
at
him
in
passing
,
and
both
remained
standing
about
.
   
<EOS>
As
there
was
only
one
house
in
the
enclosure
,
there
was
no
room
for
uncertainty
,
so
he
went
up
the
steps
of
that
house
and
knocked
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dim
light
in
two
windows
on
the
first
-
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
gave
back
a
dreary
,
vacant
sound
,
as
though
the
house
were
empty
;
but
it
was
not
,
for
a
light
was
visible
,
and
a
step
was
audible
,
almost
directly
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
came
to
the
door
,
and
a
chain
grated
,
and
a
woman
with
her
apron
thrown
over
her
face
and
head
stood
in
the
aperture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
said
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
much
amazed
by
this
appearance
,
replied
that
he
was
from
Italy
,
and
that
he
wished
to
ask
a
question
relative
to
the
missing
person
,
whom
he
knew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hi
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
woman
,
raising
a
cracked
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jeremiah
!
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
a
dry
old
man
appeared
,
whom
Mr
Dorrit
thought
he
identified
by
his
gaiters
,
as
the
rusty
screw
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
was
Under
apprehensions
of
the
dry
old
man
,
for
she
whisked
her
apron
away
as
he
approached
,
and
disclosed
a
pale
affrighted
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Open
the
door
,
you
fool
,
"
said
the
old
man
;
"
and
let
the
gentleman
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
not
without
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
towards
his
driver
and
the
cabriolet
,
walked
into
the
dim
hall
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
"
you
can
ask
anything
here
you
think
proper
;
there
are
no
secrets
here
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Before
a
reply
could
be
made
,
a
strong
stern
voice
,
though
a
woman
's
,
called
from
above
,
"
Who
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
returned
Jeremiah
.
 
<EOS>
"
More
inquiries
.
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
from
Italy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bring
him
up
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
muttered
,
as
if
he
deemed
that
unnecessary
;
but
,
turning
to
Mr
Dorrit
,
said
,
"
Mrs
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
do
as
she
likes
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
show
you
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
preceded
Mr
Dorrit
up
the
blackened
staircase
;
that
gentleman
,
not
unnaturally
looking
behind
him
on
the
road
,
saw
the
woman
following
,
with
her
apron
thrown
over
her
head
again
in
her
former
ghastly
manner
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
had
her
books
open
on
her
little
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
she
abruptly
,
as
she
eyed
her
visitor
with
a
steady
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
from
Italy
,
sir
,
are
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
was
at
a
loss
for
any
more
distinct
rejoinder
at
the
moment
than
"
Ha
---
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
this
missing
man
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
come
to
give
us
information
where
he
is
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
far
from
it
,
I
---
hum
---
have
come
to
seek
information
.
"
<EOS>
"
Unfortunately
for
us
,
there
is
none
to
be
got
here
.
 
<EOS>
Flintwinch
,
show
the
gentleman
the
handbill
.
 
<EOS>
Give
him
several
to
take
away
.
<EOS>
Hold
the
light
for
him
to
read
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
did
as
he
was
directed
,
and
Mr
Dorrit
read
it
through
,
as
if
he
had
not
previously
seen
it
;
glad
enough
of
the
opportunity
of
collecting
his
presence
of
mind
,
which
the
air
of
the
house
and
of
the
people
in
it
had
a
little
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
While
his
eyes
were
on
the
paper
,
he
felt
that
the
eyes
of
Mr
Flintwinch
and
of
Mrs
Clennam
were
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
,
when
he
looked
up
,
that
this
sensation
was
not
a
fanciful
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
know
as
much
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
"
as
we
know
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Mr
Blandois
a
friend
of
yours
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
---
a
---
hum
---
an
acquaintance
,
"
answered
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
commission
from
him
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
.
 
<EOS>
Certainly
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
searching
look
turned
gradually
to
the
floor
,
after
taking
Mr
Flintwinch
's
face
in
its
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
discomfited
by
finding
that
he
was
the
questioned
instead
of
the
questioner
,
applied
himself
to
the
reversal
of
that
unexpected
order
of
things
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
---
ha
---
a
gentleman
of
property
,
at
present
residing
in
Italy
with
my
family
,
my
servants
,
and
---
hum
---
my
rather
large
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
Being
in
London
for
a
short
time
on
affairs
connected
with
---
ha
---
my
estate
,
and
hearing
of
this
strange
disappearance
,
I
wished
to
make
myself
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
at
first
-
hand
,
because
there
is

an
English
gentleman
in
Italy
whom
I
shall
no

see
on

return

close

daily
intimacy

You

name

Never

<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
said
it
,
and
Mr
Flintwinch
echoed
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wishing
to
---

make
the
narrative
coherent

consecutive

said
Mr

three
questions

<EOS>
"
Thirty
,

Have

"
<EOS>
Not
a
twelvemonth

<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
here

will
refer
to
the
books

tell
you
when

by
whom
at
Paris
he
was
introduced
to

If

"
Mrs

added
,

should

any
satisfaction

It

poor
satisfaction

<EOS>

Have

seen
him
often

<EOS>
No

Twice

Once

suggested
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
once
.
"
   
"
Pray
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
with
a
growing
fancy
upon
him
as
he
recovered
his
importance
,
that
he
was
in
some
superior
way
in
the
Commission
of
the
Peace
;
"
pray
,
madam
,
<EOS>
may
I
inquire
,
for
the
greater
satisfaction
of
the
gentleman
whom
I
have
the
honour
to
---

retain
,
or
protect

let
me
say
to

to

Was
Monsieur
Blandois
here
on
business
on
the
night
indicated
in
this
present
sheet
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
what
he
called
business
,
"
returned
Mrs
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
---
ha
---
excuse
me
---
is
its
nature
to
be
communicated
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
evidently
impracticable
to
pass
the
barrier
of
that
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
question
has
been
asked
before
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
"
and
the
answer
has
been

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
We
do

unimportant

<EOS>
We
say

No

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
he
took
away
no
money
with
him
,
for
example
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
took
away
none
of
ours

sir

got
none

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,

observed
Mr
Dorrit
,
glancing
from
Mrs
Clennam
to
Mr
Flintwinch
,
and
from
Mr
Flintwinch
to
Mrs
Clennam
,
"
you
have
no
way
of
accounting
to
yourself
for
this
mystery
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
suppose
so
?
"
rejoined
Mrs
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
Disconcerted
by
the
cold
and
hard
inquiry
,
Mr
Dorrit
was
unable
to
assign
any
reason
for
his
supposing
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
account
for
it
,
sir
,
"
she
pursued
after
an
awkward
silence
on
Mr
Dorrit
's
part
,
"
by
having
no
doubt
that
he
is
travelling
somewhere
,
or
hiding
somewhere
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know

why
he
should
hide
anywhere

<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
exactly
the
same
<EOS>
No
as
before
,
and
put
another
barrier
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
asked
me
if
I
accounted
for
the
disappearance
to
myself
,
"
Mrs
Clennam
sternly
reminded
him
,
"
not
if
I
accounted
for
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
account
for
it
to
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
it
to
be
no
more
my
business
to
do
that
,
than
it
is
yours
to
require
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
answered
with
an
apologetic
bend
of
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
stepped
back
,
preparatory
to
saying
he
had
no
more
to
ask
,
he
could
not
but
observe
how
gloomily
<EOS>
and
fixedly
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
ground
,
and
a
certain
air
upon
her
of
resolute
waiting
;
also
,
how
exactly
the
self
-
same
expression
was
reflected
in
Mr
Flintwinch
,
standing
at
a
little
distance
from
her
chair
,
with
his
eyes
also
on
the
ground
,
and
his
right
hand
softly
rubbing
his
chin
.
   
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
Mistress
Affery
(
of
course
,
the
woman
with
the
apron
)
dropped
the
candlestick
she
held
,
and
cried
out
,
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
O
good
Lord
!
 
<EOS>
there
it
is
again
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
,
Jeremiah
!
 
<EOS>
Now
!
"
   
<EOS>
If
there
were
any
sound
at
all
,
it
was
so
slight
that
she
must
have
fallen
into
a
confirmed
habit
of
listening
for
sounds
;
but
Mr
Dorrit
believed
he
did
hear
a
something
,
like
the
falling
of
dry
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
's
terror
,
for
a
very
short
space
,
seemed
to
touch
the
three
;
and
they
all
listened
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
was
the
first
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
"
Affery
,
my
woman
,
"
said
he
,
sidling
at
her
with
his
fists
clenched
,
and
his
elbows
quivering
with
impatience
to
shake
her
,
"
you
are
at
your
old
tricks
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
walking
in
your
sleep
next
,
my
woman
,
and
playing
the
whole
round
of
your
distempered
antics
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
have
some
physic
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
have
shown
this
gentleman
out
,
I
'll
make
you
up
such
a
comfortable
dose
,
my
woman
;
such
a
comfortable
dose
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
did
not
appear
altogether
comfortable
in
expectation
to
Mistress
Affery
;
but
Jeremiah
,
without
further
reference
to
his
healing
medicine
,
took
another
candle
from
Mrs
Clennam
's
table
,
and
said
,
"
Now
,
sir
;
shall
I
light
you
down
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
professed
himself
obliged
,
and
went
down
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
shut
him
out
,
and
chained
him
out
,
without
a
moment
's
loss
of
time
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
again
passed
by
the
two
men
<EOS>
,
one
going
out
and
the
other
coming
in
;
got
into
the
vehicle
he
had
left
waiting
,
and
was
driven
away
.
   
<EOS>
Before
he
had
gone
far
,
the
driver
stopped
to
let
him
know
that
he
had
given
his
name
,
number
,
and
address
to
the
two
men
,
on
their
joint
requisition
;
and
also
the
address
at
which
he
had
taken
Mr
Dorrit
up
,
the
hour
at
which
he
had
been
called
from
his
stand
and
the
way
by
which
he
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
This
did
not
make
the
night
's
adventure
run
any
less
hotly
in
Mr
Dorrit
's
mind
,
either
when
he
sat
down
by
his
fire
again
,
or
when
he
went
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
All
night
he
haunted
the
dismal
house
,
saw
the
two
people
resolutely
waiting
,
heard
the
woman
with
her
apron
over
her
face
cry
out
about
the
noise
,
and
found
the
body
of
the
missing
Blandois
,
now
buried
in
the
cellar
,
and
now
bricked
up
in
a
wall
.

<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
's
satisfaction
in
remembering
that
it
had
not
been
necessary
for
him
to
announce
himself
to
Clennam
and
Co.
,
or
to
make
an
allusion
to
his
having
had
any
knowledge
of
the
intrusive
person
of
that
name
,
had
been
damped
over
-
night
,
while
it
was
still
fresh
,
by
a
debate
that
arose
within
him
whether
or
no
he
should
take
the
Marshalsea
in
his
way
back
,
and
look
at
the
old
gate
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
decided
not
to
do
so
;
and
had
astonished
the
coachman
by
being
very
fierce
with
him
for
proposing
to
go
over
London
Bridge
and
recross
the
river
by
Waterloo
Bridge
---
a
course
which
would
have
taken
him
almost
within
sight
of
his
old
quarters
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
for
all
that
,
the
question
had
raised
a
conflict
in
his
breast
;
and
,
for
some
odd
reason
or
no
reason
,
he
was
vaguely
dissatisfied
.
 
<EOS>
Even
at
the
Merdle
dinner
-
table
next
day
,
he
was
so
out
of
sorts
about
it
that
he
continued
at
intervals
to
turn
it
over
and
over
,
in
a
manner
frightfully
inconsistent
with
the
good
society
surrounding
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
him
hot
to
think
what
the
Chief
Butler
's
opinion
of
him
would
have
been
,
if
that
illustrious
personage
could
have
plumbed
with
that
heavy
eye
of
his
the
stream
of
his
meditations
.
   
<EOS>
The
farewell
banquet
was
of
a
gorgeous
nature
,
and
wound
up
his
visit
in
a
most
brilliant
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
combined
with
the
attractions
of
her
youth
and
beauty
,
a
certain
weight
of
self
-
sustainment
as
if
she
had
been
married
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
could
leave
her
with
a
quiet
mind
to
tread
the
paths
of
distinction
,
and
wished
---
<EOS>
but
without
abatement
of
patronage
,
and
without
prejudice
to
the
retiring
virtues
of
his
favourite
child
---
that
he
had
such
another
daughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
he
told
her
at
parting
,
"
our
family
looks
to
you
to
---
ha
---
assert
its
dignity
and
---
hum
<EOS>
---
maintain
its
importance
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
never
disappoint
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
you
may
rely
upon
that
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
My
best
love
to
dearest
Amy
,
and
<EOS>
I
will
write
to
her
very
soon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
convey
any
message
to
---
ha
---
anybody
else
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mr
Dorrit
,
in
an
insinuating
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
said
Fanny
,
before
whom
Mrs
General
instantly
loomed
,
"
no
,
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
very
kind
,
Pa
,
but
I
must
beg
to
be
excused
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
other
message
to
send
<EOS>
,
I
thank
you
,
dear
papa
,
that
it
would
be
at
all
agreeable
to
you
to
take
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
parted
in
an
outer
drawing
-
room
,
where
only
Mr
Sparkler
waited
on
his
lady
,
and
dutifully
bided
his
time
for
shaking
hands
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Sparkler
was
admitted
to
this
closing
audience
,
Mr
Merdle
came
creeping
in
with
not
much
more
appearance
of
arms
in
his
sleeves
than
if
he
had
been
the
twin
brother
of
Miss
Biffin
,
and
insisted
on
escorting
Mr
Dorrit
down
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
All
Mr
Dorrit
's
protestations
being
in
vain
,
he
enjoyed
the
honour
of
being
accompanied
to
the
hall
-
door
by
this
distinguished
man
,
who
(
as
Mr
Dorrit
told
him
in
shaking
hands
on
the
step
)
<EOS>
had
really
overwhelmed
him
with
attentions
and
services
during
this
memorable
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
they
parted
;
Mr
Dorrit
entering
his
carriage
with
a
swelling
breast
,
not
at
all
sorry
that
his
Courier
,
who
had
come
to
take
leave
in
the
lower
regions
,
should
have
an
opportunity
of
beholding
the
grandeur
of
his
departure
.
   
<EOS>
The
aforesaid
grandeur
was
yet
full
upon
Mr
Dorrit
when
he
alighted
at
his
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Helped
out
by
the
Courier
and
some
half
-
dozen
of
the
hotel
servants
,
he
was
passing
through
the
hall
with
a
serene
magnificence
,
when
lo
!
 
<EOS>
a
sight
presented
itself
that
struck
him
dumb
and
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
John
Chivery
,
in
his
best
clothes
,
with
his
tall
hat
under
his
arm
,
his
ivory
-
handled
cane
genteelly
embarrassing
his
deportment
,
and
a
bundle
of
cigars
in
his
hand
!
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
young
man
,
"
said
the
porter
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
This
young
man
has
persisted
in
waiting
,
sir
,
saying
you
would
be
glad
to
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
glared
on
the
young
man
,
choked
,
and
said
,
in
the
mildest
of
tones
,
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Young
John
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
Young
John
,
I
think
;
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Young
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
ha
---
thought
it
was
Young
john
!
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
young
man
may
come
up
,
"
turning
to
the
attendants
,
as
he
passed
on
:
"
oh
yes
,
he
may
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
Let
Young
John
follow
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
him
above
.
"
   
<EOS>
Young
John
followed
,
smiling
and
much
gratified
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
's
rooms
were
reached
.
 
<EOS>
Candles
were
lighted
.
 
<EOS>
The
attendants
withdrew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
turning
round
upon
him
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
when
they
were
safely
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
amazement
and
horror
depicted
in
the
unfortunate
john
's
face
---
for
he
had
rather
expected
to
be
embraced
next
---
were
of
that
powerfully
expressive
nature
that
Mr
Dorrit
withdrew
his
hand
and
merely
glared
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
do
this
?
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
presume
to
come
here
?
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
insult
me
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
insult
you
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Young
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Insult
me
.
 
<EOS>
Your
coming
here
is
an
affront
,
an
impertinence
,
an
audacity
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
wanted
here
.
   
<EOS>
Who
sent
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
What
---
ha
---
the
Devil
do
you
do
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
sir
,
"
said
Young
John
,
with
as
pale
and
shocked
a
face
as
ever
had
been
turned
to
Mr
Dorrit
's
in
his
life
---
even
in
his
College
life
:
"
I
thought
,
sir
,
you
might
n't
object
to
have
the
goodness
to
accept
a
bundle
---
"
   
"
Damn
your
bundle
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Dorrit
,
in
irrepressible
rage
.
<EOS>
"
I
---
hum
---
do
n't
smoke
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
humbly
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
used
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
that
again
,
"
cried
Mr
Dorrit
,
quite
beside
himself
,
"
and
I
'll
take
the
poker
to
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
Chivery
backed
to
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
sir
!
"
cried
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
you
,
   
sit
down
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
Chivery
dropped
into
the
chair
nearest
the
door
,
and
Mr
Dorrit
walked
up
and
down
the
room
;
rapidly
at
first
;
then
,
more
slowly
.
<EOS>
Once
,
he
went
to
the
window
,
and
stood
there
with
his
forehead
against
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
All
of
a
sudden
,
he
turned
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
What
else
did
you
come
for
,
Sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
else
in
the
world
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Only
to
say
,
Sir
,
that
I
hoped
you
was
well
,
and
only
to
ask
if
Miss
Amy
was
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
to
you
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
to
me
,
sir
,
by
rights
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
lessening
the
distance
<EOS>
betwixt
us
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
it
's
a
liberty
,
sir
,
<EOS>
but
I
never
thought
you
'd
have
taken
it
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
sir
,
"
said
Young
John
,
with
emotion
,
"
in
my
poor
way
,
I
am
too
proud
to
have
come
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
if
I
had
thought
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
was
ashamed
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
back
to
the
window
,
and
leaned
his
forehead
against
the
glass
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
turned
,
he
had
his
handkerchief
in
his
hand
,
and
he
had
been
wiping
his
eyes
with
it
,
and
he
looked
tired
and
ill
.
   
<EOS>
"
Young
John
,
I
am
very
sorry
to
have
been
hasty
with
you
,
but
---
ha
---
some
remembrances
are
not
happy
remembrances
,
and
---
hum
---
you
should
n't
have
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
that
now
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
Chivery
;
"
but
I
did
n't
before
,
and
Heaven
knows
I
meant
no
harm
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
---
<EOS>
hum
---
<EOS>
sure
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
,
Young
John
,
give
me
your
hand
.
"
   
<EOS>
Young
John
gave
it
;
but
Mr
Dorrit
had
driven
his
heart
out
of
it
,
and
nothing
could
change
his
face
now
,
from
its
white
,
shocked
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
slowly
shaking
hands
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
again
,
Young
John
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
---
but
I
'd
rather
stand
.

Mr
Dorrit
sat
down
instead

<EOS>
After
painfully
holding
his
head
a
little
while
,
he
turned
it
to
his
visitor
,
and
said
,
with
an
effort
to
be
easy
:
   
"

And

Mr

with

at

anathematised

"
Thank

John

<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>

I
'll
write

"
   
<EOS>
His
hand
shook
so
that
he
was
a
long
time
writing
it
,
and
wrote
it
in
a
tremulous
scrawl
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
cheque
for
one
hundred
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
He
folded
it
up
,
put
it
in
Young

hand

pressed
the
hand
in

"
   
<EOS>
But
nothing
while
John
was
there
could
change
John

face
to
its
natural
colour
and
expression
,
or
restore
John

And

John

said
Mr

,
giving
his
hand
a
final
pressure
,
and
releasing
it
,
"
<EOS>
I

"
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
sir

"
returned
John
Chivery
,
"
in
my
poor
humble
way
,
sir
,
I
'm
too
proud
and
honourable
to
do
it
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
was
not
too
proud
and
honourable
to
listen
at
the
door
that
he
might
ascertain
for
himself
whether
John
really
went
straight
out
,
or
lingered
to
have
any
talk
with
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
that
he
went
direct
out
at
the
door
,
and
away
down
the
street
with
a
quick
step
.
 
<EOS>
After
remaining
alone
for
an
hour
,
Mr
Dorrit
rang
for
the
Courier
,
who
found
him
with
his
chair
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
sitting
with
his
back
towards
him
and
his
face
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
take
that
bundle
of
cigars
to
smoke
on
the
journey
,
if
you
like
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
with
a
careless
wave
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
---
brought
by
---
hum
---
little
offering
from
---
ha
---
son
of
old
tenant
of
mine

"
   
<EOS>
Next
morning
's
sun
saw
Mr
Dorrit
's
equipage
upon
the
Dover
road
,
where
every
red
-
jacketed
postilion
was
the
sign
of
a
cruel
house
,
established
for
the
unmerciful
plundering
of
travellers
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
business
of
the
human
race
,
between
London
and
Dover
,
being
spoliation
,
Mr
Dorrit
was
waylaid
at
Dartford
,
pillaged
at
Gravesend
,
rifled
at
Rochester
,
fleeced
at
Sittingbourne
,
and
sacked
at
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
it
being
the
Courier
's
business
to
get
him
out
of
the
hands
of
the
banditti
,
the
Courier
brought
him
off
at
every
stage
;
and
so
the
red
-
jackets
went
gleaming
merrily
along
the
spring
landscape
,
rising
and
falling
to
a
regular
measure
,
between
Mr
Dorrit
in
his
snug
corner
and
the
next
chalky
rise
in
the
dusty
highway
.
   
<EOS>
Another
day
's
sun
saw
him
at
Calais
.
 
<EOS>
And
having
now
got
the
Channel
between
himself
and
John
Chivery
,
he
began
to
feel
safe
,
and
to
find
that
the
foreign
air
was
lighter
to
breathe
than
the
air
of
England
.
   
<EOS>
On
again
by
the
heavy
French
roads
for
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
Having
now
quite
recovered
his
equanimity
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
in
his
snug
corner
,
fell
to
castle
-
building
as
he
rode
along
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
he
had
a
very
large
castle
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
All
day
long
he
was
running
towers
up
,
taking
towers
down
,
adding
a
wing
here
,
putting
on
a
battlement
there
,
looking
to
the
walls
,
strengthening
the
defences
,
giving
ornamental
touches
to
the
interior
,
making
in
all
respects
a
superb
castle
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
preoccupied
face
so
clearly
denoted
the
pursuit
in
which
he
was
engaged
,
that
every
cripple
at
the
post
-
houses
,
not
blind
,
who
shoved
his
little
battered
tin
-
box
in
at
the
carriage
window
for
Charity
in
the
name
of
Heaven
,
Charity
in
the
name
of
our
Lady
,
Charity
in
the
name
of
all
the
Saints
,
knew
as
well
what
work
he
was
at
,
as
their
countryman
Le
Brun
could
have
known
it
himself
,
though
he
had
made
that
English
traveller
the
subject
of
a
special
physiognomical
treatise
.
   
<EOS>
Arrived
at
Paris
,
and
resting
there
three
days
,
Mr
Dorrit
strolled
much
about
the
streets
alone
,
looking
in
at
the
shop
-
windows
,
and
particularly
the
jewellers
'
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Ultimately
,
he
went
into
the
most
famous
jeweller
's
,
and
said
he
wanted
to
buy
a
little
gift
for
a
lady
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
charming
little
woman
to
whom
he
said
it
---
a
sprightly
little
woman
,
dressed
in
perfect
taste
,
who
came
out
of
a
green
velvet
bower
to
attend
upon
him
,
from
posting
up
some
dainty
little
books
of
account
which
one
could
hardly
suppose
to
be
ruled
for
the
entry
of
any
articles
more
commercial
than
kisses
,
at
a
dainty
little
shining
desk
which
looked
in
itself
like
a
sweetmeat
.
   
<EOS>
For
example
,
then
,
said
the
little
woman
,
what
species
of
gift
did
Monsieur
desire
?
 
<EOS>
A
love
-
gift
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
smiled
,
and
said
,
Eh
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
he
know
?
<EOS>
It
was
always
possible
;
the
sex
being
so
charming
.
 
<EOS>
Would
she
show
him
some
?
   
<EOS>
Most
willingly
,
said
the
little
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Flattered
and
enchanted
to
show
him
many
.
 
<EOS>
But
pardon
!
 
<EOS>
To
begin
with
,
he
would
have
the
great
goodness
to
observe
that
there
were
love
-
gifts
,
and
there
were
nuptial
gifts
.
 
<EOS>
For
example
,
these
ravishing
ear
-
rings
and
this
necklace
so
superb
to
correspond
,
were
what
one
called
a
love
-
gift
.
<EOS>
These
brooches
and
these
rings
,
of
a
beauty
so
gracious
and
celestial
,
were
what
one
called
,
with
the
permission
of
Monsieur
,
nuptial
gifts
.
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
would
be
a
good
arrangement
,
Mr
Dorrit
hinted
,
smiling
,
to
purchase
both
,
and
to
present
the
love
-
gift
first
,
and
to
finish
with
the
nuptial
offering
?
   
<EOS>
Ah
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
said
the
little
woman
,
laying
the
tips
of
the
fingers
of
her
two
little
hands
against
each
other
,
that
would
be
generous
indeed
,
that
would
be
a
special
gallantry
!
 
<EOS>
And
without
doubt
the
lady
so
crushed
with
gifts
would
find
them
irresistible
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
was
not
sure
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
example
,
the
sprightly
little
woman
was
very
sure
of
it
,
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Dorrit
bought
a
gift
of
each
sort
,
and
paid
handsomely
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
strolled
back
to
his
hotel
afterwards
,
he
carried
his
head
high
:
having
plainly
got
up
his
castle
now
to
a
much
loftier
altitude
than
the
two
square
towers
of
Notre
Dame
.
   
<EOS>
Building
away
with
all
his
might
,
but
reserving
the
plans
of
his
castle
exclusively
for
his
own
eye
,
Mr
Dorrit
posted
away
for
Marseilles
.
 
<EOS>
Building
on
,
building
on
,
busily
,
busily
,
from
morning
to
night
.
 
<EOS>
Falling
asleep
,
and
leaving
great
blocks
of
building
materials
dangling
in
the
air
;
waking
again
,
to
resume
work
and
get
them
into
their
places
.
 
<EOS>
What
time
the
Courier
in
the
rumble
,
smoking
Young
john
's
best
cigars
,
left
a
little
thread
of
thin
light
smoke
behind
---
perhaps
as
he
built
a
castle
or
two
with
stray
pieces
of
Mr
Dorrit
's
money
.
   
<EOS>
Not
a
fortified
town
that
they
passed
in
all
their
journey
was
as
strong
,
not
a
Cathedral
summit
was
as
high
,
as
Mr
Dorrit
's
castle
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
Saone
nor
the
Rhone
sped
with
the
swiftness
of
that
peerless
building
;
nor
was
the
Mediterranean
deeper
than
its
foundations
;
nor
were
the
distant
landscapes
on
the
Cornice
road
,
nor
the
hills
and
bay
of
Genoa
the
Superb
,
more
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
and
his
matchless
castle
were
disembarked
among
the
dirty
white
houses
and
dirtier
felons
of
Civita
Vecchia
,
and
thence
scrambled
on
to
Rome
as
they
could
,
through
the
filth
that
festered
on
the
way
.

<EOS>
The
Storming
of
the
Castle
in
the
Air
 
<EOS>
The
sun
had
gone
down
full
four
hours
,
and
it
was
later
than
most
travellers
would
like
it
to
be
for
finding
themselves
outside
the
walls
of
Rome
,
when
Mr
Dorrit
's
carriage
,
still
on
its
last
wearisome
stage
,
rattled
over
the
solitary
Campagna
.
 
<EOS>
The
savage
herdsmen
and
the
fierce
-
looking
peasants
who
had
chequered
the
way
while
the
light
lasted
,
had
all
gone
down
with
the
sun
,
and
left
the
wilderness
blank
.
 
<EOS>
At
some
turns
of
the
road
,
a
pale
flare
on
the
horizon
,
like
an
exhalation
from
the
ruin
-
sown
land
,
showed
that
the
city
was
yet
far
off
;
but
this
poor
relief
was
rare
and
short
-
lived
.
 
<EOS>
The
carriage
dipped
down
again
into
a
hollow
of
the
black
dry
sea
,
and
for
a
long
time
there
was
nothing
visible
save
its
petrified
swell
and
the
gloomy
sky
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
though
he
had
his
castle
-
building
to
engage
his
mind
,
could
not
be
quite
easy
in
that
desolate
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
far
more
curious
,
in
every
swerve
of
the
carriage
,
and
every
cry
of
the
postilions
,
than
he
had
been
since
he
quitted
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
valet
on
the
box
evidently
quaked
.
 
<EOS>
The
Courier
in
the
rumble
was
not
altogether
comfortable
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
As
often
as
Mr
Dorrit
let
down
the
glass
and
looked
back
at
him
(
which
was
very
often
)
,
he
saw
him
smoking
John
Chivery
out
,
it
is
true
,
but
still
generally
standing
up
the
while
and
looking
about
him
,
like
a
man
who
had
his
suspicions
,
and
kept
upon
his
guard
.
 
<EOS>
Then
would
Mr
Dorrit
,
pulling
up
the
glass
again
,
reflect
that
those
postilions
were
cut
-
throat
looking
fellows
,
and
that
he
would
have
done
better
to
have
slept
at
Civita
Vecchia
,
and
have
started
betimes
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
this
,
he
worked
at
his
castle
in
the
intervals
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
fragments
of
ruinous
enclosure
,
yawning
window
-
gap
and
crazy
wall
,
deserted
houses
,
leaking
wells
,
broken
water
-
tanks
,
spectral
cypress
-
trees
,
patches
of
tangled
vine
,
and
the
changing
of
the
track
to
a
long
,
irregular
,
disordered
lane
where
everything
was
crumbling
away
,
from
the
unsightly
buildings
to
the
jolting
road
---
now
,
these
objects
showed
that
they
were
nearing
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
a
sudden
twist
and
stoppage
of
the
carriage
inspired
Mr
Dorrit
with
the
mistrust
that
the
brigand
moment
was
come
for
twisting
him
into
a
ditch
and
robbing
him
;
until
,
letting
down
the
glass
again
and
looking
out
,
he
perceived
himself
assailed
by
nothing
worse
than
a
funeral
procession
,
which
came
mechanically
chaunting
by
,
with
an
indistinct
show
of
dirty
vestments
,
lurid
torches
,
swinging
censers
,
and
a
great
cross
borne
before
a
priest
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
ugly
priest
by
torchlight
;
of
a
lowering
aspect
,
with
an
overhanging
brow
;
and
as
his
eyes
met
those
of
Mr
Dorrit
,
looking
bareheaded
out
of
the
carriage
,
his
lips
,
moving
as
they
chaunted
,
seemed
to
threaten
that
important
traveller
;
likewise
the
action
of
his
hand
,
which
was
in
fact
his
manner
of
returning
the
traveller
's
salutation
,
seemed
to
come
in
aid
of
that
menace
.
 
<EOS>
So
thought
Mr
Dorrit
,
made
fanciful
by
the
weariness
of
building
and
travelling
,
as
the
priest
drifted
past
him
,
and
the
procession
straggled
away
,
taking
its
dead
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
their
so
-
different
way
went
Mr
Dorrit
's
company
too
;
and
soon
,
with
their
coach
load
of
luxuries
from
the
two
great
capitals
of
Europe
,
they
were
(
like
the
Goths
reversed
)
beating
at
the
gates
of
Rome
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
was
not
expected
by
his
own
people
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
;
but
they
had
given
him
up
until
to
-
morrow
,
not
doubting
that
it
was
later
than
he
would
care
,
in
those
parts
,
to
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
his
equipage
stopped
at
his
own
gate
,
no
one
but
the
porter
appeared
to
receive
him
.
 
<EOS>
Was
Miss
Dorrit
from
home
?
 
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
within
.
 
<EOS>
Good
,
said
Mr
Dorrit
to
the
assembling
servants
;
let
them
keep
where
they
were
;
let
them
help
to
unload
the
carriage
;
he
would
find
Miss
Dorrit
for
himself
.
<EOS>
So
he
went
up
his
grand
staircase
,
slowly
,
and
tired
,
and
looked
into
various
chambers
which
were
empty
,
until
he
saw
a
light
in
a
small
ante
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
curtained
nook
,
like
a
tent
,
within
two
other
rooms
;
and
it
looked
warm
and
bright
in
colour
,
as
he
approached
it
through
the
dark
avenue
they
made
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
draped
doorway
,
but
no
door
;
and
as
he
stopped
here
,
looking
in
unseen
,
he
felt
a
pang
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
not
like
jealousy
?
 
<EOS>
For
why
like
jealousy
?
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
his
daughter
and
his
brother
there
:
he
,
with
his
chair
drawn
to
the
hearth
,
enjoying
the
warmth
of
the
evening
wood
fire
;
she
seated
at
a
little
table
,
busied
with
some
embroidery
work
.
 
<EOS>
Allowing
for
the
great
difference
in
the
still
-
life
of
the
picture
,
the
figures
were
much
the
same
as
of
old
;
his
brother
being
sufficiently
like
himself
to
represent
himself
,
for
a
moment
,
in
the
composition
.
 
<EOS>
So
had
he
sat
many
a
night
,
over
a
coal
fire
far
away
;
so
had
she
sat
,
devoted
to
him
.
<EOS>
Yet
surely
there
was
nothing
to
be
jealous
of
in
the
old
miserable
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
Whence
,
then
,
the
pang
in
his
heart
?
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
uncle
,
I
think
you
are
growing
young
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
Her
uncle
shook
his
head
and
said
,
"
Since
when
,
my
dear
;
since
when
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
returned
Little
Dorrit
,
plying
her
needle
,
"
that
you
have
been
growing
younger
for
weeks
past
.
 
<EOS>
So
cheerful
,
uncle
,
and
so
ready
,
and
so
interested
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
---
all
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
me
,
uncle
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
done
me
a
world
of
good
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
so
considerate
of
me
,
and
so
tender
with
me
,
and
so
delicate
in
trying
to
hide
your
attentions
from
me
,
that
I
---
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
treasured
up
,
my
darling
,
treasured
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
in
it
but
your
own
fresh
fancy
,
uncle
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
cheerfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
well
!
<EOS>
"
murmured
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
paused
for
an
instant
in
her
work
to
look
at
him
,
and
her
look
revived
that
former
pain
in
her
father
's
breast
;
in
his
poor
weak
breast
,
so
full
of
contradictions
,
vacillations
,
inconsistencies
,
the
little
peevish
perplexities
of
this
ignorant
life
,
mists
which
the
morning
without
a
night
only
can
clear
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
freer
with
you
,
you
see
,
my
dove
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
since
we
have
been
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
alone
,
for
I
do
n't
count
Mrs
General
<EOS>
;
I
do
n't
care
for
her
;
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
Fanny
was
impatient
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
,
or
complain
of
it
,
for
I
am
sensible
that
I
must
be
in
the
way
,
though
I
try
to
keep
out
of
it
as
well
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
not
fit
company
for
our
company
.
 
<EOS>
My
brother
William
,
"
said
the
old
man
admiringly
,
"
is
fit
company
for
monarchs
;
but
not
so
your
uncle
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Frederick
Dorrit
is
no
credit
to
William
Dorrit
,
and
he
knows
it
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
here
's
your
father
,
Amy
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
William
,
welcome
back
!
 
<EOS>
My
beloved
brother
,
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
(
Turning
his
head
in
speaking
,
he
had
caught
sight
of
him
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
.
)
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
with
a
cry
of
pleasure
put
her
arms
about
her
father
's
neck
,
and
kissed
him
again
and
again
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
was
a
little
impatient
,
and
a
little
querulous
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
you
at
last
,
Amy
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
.
 
<EOS>
Really
I
am
glad
to
find
---
<EOS>
hum
---
any
one
to
receive
me
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
appear
to
have
been
---
ha
---
so
little
expected
,
that
upon
my
word
I
began
---
ha
hum
---
to
think
it
might
be
right
to
offer
an
apology
for
---
ha
---
taking
the
liberty
of
coming
back
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
so
late
,
my
dear
William
,
"
said
his
brother
,
"
that
we
had
given
you
up
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
stronger
than
you
,
dear
Frederick
,
"
returned
his
brother
with
an
elaboration
of
fraternity
in
which
there
was
severity
;
"
and
I
hope
I
can
travel
without
detriment
at
---
ha
---
any
hour
I
choose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
surely
,
"
returned
the
other
,
with
a
misgiving
that
he
had
given
offence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
William
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Amy
,
"
pursued
Mr
Dorrit
,
as
she
helped
him
to
put
off
his
wrappers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
it
without
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
ha
---
need
not
trouble
you
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
have
a
morsel
of
bread
and
a
glass
of
wine
,
or
<EOS>
---
hum
---
would
it
cause
too
much
inconvenience
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
father
,
you
shall
have
supper
in
a
very
few
minutes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
with
a
reproachful
frost
upon
him
;
"
I
---
ha
---
am
afraid
I
am
causing
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
Hum
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
pretty
well
?
"
   
"
Mrs
General
complained
of
a
headache
,
and
of
being
fatigued
;
and
so
,
when
we
gave
you
up
,
she
went
to
bed
,
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
Mr
Dorrit
thought
that
Mrs
General
had
done
well
in
being
overcome
by
the
disappointment
of
his
not
arriving
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
his
face
relaxed
,
and
he
said
with
obvious
satisfaction
,
"
Extremely
sorry
to
hear
that
Mrs
General
is
not
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
During
this
short
dialogue
,
his
daughter
had
been
observant
of
him
,
with
something
more
than
her
usual
interest
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
seem
as
though
he
had
a
changed
or
worn
appearance
in
her
eyes
,
and
he
perceived
and
resented
it
;
for
he
said
with
renewed
peevishness
,
when
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
travelling
-
cloak
,
and
had
come
to
the
fire
:
"
Amy
,
what
are
you
looking
at
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
see
in
me
that
causes
you
to
---
ha
---
concentrate
your
solicitude
on
me
in
that
---
hum
---
very
particular
manner
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
it
,
father
;
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
It
gladdens
my
eyes
to
see
you
again
;
that
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
's
all
,
because
---
ha
---
that
's
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
---
hum
---
you
think
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
with
an
accusatory
emphasis
,
"
that
I
am
not
looking
well
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
looked
a
little
tired
,
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
mistaken
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
I
am
not
tired
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
hum
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
fresher
than
I
was
when
I
went
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
so
inclined
to
be
angry
that
she
said
nothing
more
in
her
justification
,
but
remained
quietly
beside
him
embracing
his
arm
.
<EOS>
As
he
stood
thus
,
with
his
brother
on
the
other
side
,
he
fell
into
a
heavy
doze
,
of
not
a
minute
's
duration
,
and
awoke
with
a
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
Frederick
,
"
he
said
,
turning
to
his
brother
:
<EOS>
"
I
recommend
you
to
go
to
bed
immediately
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
William
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wait
and
see
you
sup
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Frederick
,
"
he
retorted
,
"
I
beg
you
to
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
ha
---
make
it
a
personal
request
that
you
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
You
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
very
feeble
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
said
the
old
man
,
who
had
no
wish
but
to
please
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Frederick
,
"
returned
Mr
Dorrit
,
with
an
astonishing
superiority
to
his
brother
's
failing
powers
,
"
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
painful
to
me
to
see
you
so
weak
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
.
 
<EOS>
It
distresses
me
.
 
<EOS>
Hum
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
find
you
looking
at
all
well
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
fit
for
this
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
be
more
careful
,
you
should
be
very
careful
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
to
bed
?
"
asked
Frederick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Frederick
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
do
,
I
adjure
you
!
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
brother
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
stronger
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
pleased
with
your
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
dear
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
After
dismissing
his
brother
in
this
gracious
way
,
he
fell
into
a
doze
again
before
the
old
man
was
well
out
of
the
room
:
and
he
would
have
stumbled
forward
upon
the
logs
,
but
for
his
daughter
's
restraining
hold
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
wanders
very
much
,
Amy
,
"
he
said
,
when
he
was
thus
roused
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
less
---
ha
---
coherent
,
and
his
conversation
is
more
---
hum
---
broken
,
<EOS>
than
I
have
---
ha
,
hum
---
ever
known
.
 
<EOS>
Has
he
had
any
illness
since
I
have
been
gone
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
---
ha
---
see
a
great
change
in
him
,
Amy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
observed
it
,
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Greatly
broken
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Greatly
broken
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
,
affectionate
,
failing
Frederick
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
.
 
<EOS>
Even
taking
into
account
what
he
was
before
,
he
is
---
hum
---
sadly
broken
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
supper
,
which
was
brought
to
him
there
,
and
spread
upon
the
little
table
where
he
had
seen
her
working
,
diverted
his
attention
.
   
<EOS>
She
sat
at
his
side
as
in
the
days
that
were
gone
,
for
the
first
time
since
those
days
ended
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
alone
,
and
she
helped
him
to
his
meat
and
poured
out
his
drink
for
him
,
as
she
had
been
used
to
do
in
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
happened
now
,
for
the
first
time
since
their
accession
to
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
to
look
at
him
much
,
after
the
offence
he
had
taken
;
but
she
noticed
two
occasions
in
the
course
of
his
meal
,
when
he
all
of
a
sudden
looked
at
her
,
and
looked
about
him
,
as
if
the
association
were
so
strong
that
he
needed
assurance
from
his
sense
of
sight
that
they
were
not
in
the
old
prison
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Both
times
,
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
as
if
he
missed
his
old
black
cap
---
though
it
had
been
ignominiously
given
away
in
the
Marshalsea
,
and
had
never
got
free
to
that
hour
,
but
still
hovered
about
the
yards
on
the
head
of
his
successor
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
very
little
supper
,
but
was
a
long
time
over
it
,
and
often
reverted
to
his
brother
's
declining
state
.
 
<EOS>
Though
he
expressed
the
greatest
pity
for
him
,
he
was
almost
bitter
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
that
poor
Frederick
---
ha
hum
---
drivelled
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
word
to
express
it
;
drivelled
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
melancholy
to
reflect
what
Amy
must
have
undergone
from
the
excessive
tediousness
of
his
Society
---
wandering
and
babbling
on
,
poor
dear
estimable
creature
,
wandering
and
babbling
on
---
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
relief
she
had
had
in
Mrs
General
.
 
<EOS>
Extremely
sorry
,
he
then
repeated
with
his
former
satisfaction
,
that
that
---
ha
---
superior
woman
was
poorly
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
in
her
watchful
love
,
would
have
remembered
the
lightest
thing
he
said
or
did
that
night
,
though
she
had
had
no
subsequent
reason
to
recall
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
always
remembered
that
,
when
he
looked
about
him
under
the
strong
influence
of
the
old
association
,
he
tried
to
keep
it
out
of
her
mind
,
and
perhaps
out
of
his
own
too
,
by
immediately
expatiating
on
the
great
riches
and
great
company
that
had
encompassed
him
in
his
absence
,
and
on
the
lofty
position
he
and
his
family
had
to
sustain
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
fail
to
recall
that
there
were
two
under
-
currents
,
side
by
side
,
pervading
all
his
discourse
and
all
his
manner
;
one
showing
her
how
well
he
had
got
on
without
her
,
and
how
independent
he
was
of
her
;
<EOS>
the
other
,
in
a
fitful
and
unintelligible
way
almost
complaining
of
her
,
as
if
it
had
been
possible
that
she
had
neglected
him
while
he
was
away
.
   
<EOS>
His
telling
her
of
the
glorious
state
that
Mr
Merdle
kept
,
and
of
the
court
that
bowed
before
him
,
naturally
brought
him
to
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
So
naturally
indeed
,
that
although
there
was
an
unusual
want
of
sequence
in
the
greater
part
of
his
remarks
,
he
passed
to
her
at
once
,
and
asked
how
she
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
going
away
next
week
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Home
?
"
asked
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
After
a
few
weeks
'
stay
upon
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
a
vast
loss
here
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
vast
---
ha
---
acquisition
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
To
Fanny
,
and
to
---
hum
---
the
rest
of
the
---
ha
---
great
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
thought
of
the
competition
that
was
to
be
entered
upon
,
and
assented
very
softly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Merdle
is
going
to
have
a
great
farewell
Assembly
,
dear
,
and
a
dinner
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
expressing
her
anxiety
that
you
should
return
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
invited
both
you
and
me
to
her
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
---
ha
---
very
kind
.
 
<EOS>
When
is
the
day
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Write
round
in
the
morning
,
and
say
that
I
have
returned
,
and
shall
---
hum
---
be
delighted
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
walk
with
you
up
the
stairs
to
your
room
,
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
looking
angrily
round
;
for
he
was
moving
away
,
as
if
forgetful
of
leave
-
taking
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
not
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
no
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
your
father
,
not
your
infirm
uncle
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
checked
himself
,
as
abruptly
as
he
had
broken
into
this
reply
,
and
said
,
"
You
have
not
kissed
me
,
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
We
must
marry
---
ha
---
we
must
marry
YOU
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
went
,
more
slowly
and
more
tired
,
up
the
staircase
to
his
rooms
,
and
,
almost
as
soon
as
he
got
there
,
dismissed
his
valet
.
 
<EOS>
His
next
care
was
to
look
about
him
for
his
Paris
purchases
,
and
,
after
opening
their
cases
and
carefully
surveying
them
,
to
put
them
away
under
lock
and
key
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
what
with
dozing
and
what
with
castle
-
building
,
he
lost
himself
for
a
long
time
,
so
that
there
was
a
touch
of
morning
on
the
eastward
rim
of
the
desolate
Campagna
when
he
crept
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
sent
up
her
compliments
in
good
time
next
day
,
and
hoped
he
had
rested
well
after
this
fatiguing
journey
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
down
his
compliments
,
and
begged
to
inform
Mrs
General
that
he
had
rested
very
well
indeed
,
and
was
in
high
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
did
not
come
forth
from
his
own
rooms
until
late
in
the
afternoon
;
and
,
although
he
then
caused
himself
to
be
magnificently
arrayed
for
a
drive
with
Mrs
General
and
his
daughter
,
his
appearance
was
scarcely
up
to
his
description
of
himself
.
<EOS>
As
the
family
had
no
visitors
that
day
,
its
four
members
dined
alone
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
conducted
Mrs
General
to
the
seat
at
his
right
hand
with
immense
ceremony
;
and
Little
Dorrit
could
not
but
notice
as
she
followed
with
her
uncle
,
both
that
he
was
again
elaborately
dressed
,
and
that
his
manner
towards
Mrs
General
was
very
particular
.
 
<EOS>
The
perfect
formation
of
that
accomplished
lady
's
surface
rendered
it
difficult
to
displace
an
atom
of
its
genteel
glaze
,
but
Little
Dorrit
thought
she
descried
a
slight
thaw
of
triumph
in
a
corner
of
her
frosty
eye
.
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
what
may
be
called
in
these
pages
the
Pruney
and
Prismatic
nature
of
the
family
banquet
,
Mr
Dorrit
several
times
fell
asleep
while
it
was
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
His
fits
of
dozing
were
as
sudden
as
they
had
been
overnight
,
and
were
as
short
and
profound
.
<EOS>
When
the
first
of
these
slumberings
seized
him
,
Mrs
General
looked
almost
amazed
:
but
,
on
each
recurrence
of
the
symptoms
,
she
told
her
polite
beads
,
Papa
,
Potatoes
,
Poultry
,
Prunes
,
and
Prism
;
and
,
by
dint
of
going
through
that
infallible
performance
very
slowly
,
appeared
to
finish
her
rosary
at
about
the
same
time
as
Mr
Dorrit
started
from
his
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
again
painfully
aware
of
a
somnolent
tendency
in
Frederick
(
which
had
no
existence
out
of
his
own
imagination
)
,
and
after
dinner
,
when
Frederick
had
withdrawn
,
privately
apologised
to
Mrs
General
for
the
poor
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
most
estimable
and
affectionate
of
brothers
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
---
<EOS>
ha
,
hum
---
broken
up
altogether
.
<EOS>
Unhappily
,
declining
fast
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Frederick
,
sir
,
"
quoth
Mrs
General
,
"
is
habitually
absent
and
drooping
,
but
let
us
hope
it
is
not
so
bad
as
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
however
,
was
determined
not
to
let
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fast
declining
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
A
wreck
.
 
<EOS>
A

.
 
<EOS>
Mouldering

before

<EOS>
Hum

<EOS>
Good

!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
left
Mrs
Sparkler
quite
well
and
happy
,
I
trust
?
"
said
Mrs
General
,
after
heaving
a
cool
sigh
for
Frederick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Surrounded
,
"
replied
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
by
---

---
all
that
can
charm
the
taste
,
and
---
hum

elevate
the
mind

<EOS>
Happy

my
dear
madam
,
in
a

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
was
a
little
fluttered
;
seeming
delicately
to
put
the
word
away
with
her
gloves
,
as
if
there
were
no
knowing
what
it
might
lead
to
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
Mr
Dorrit
continued
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
Mrs

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Mrs
General
(
with
a
little
extra
stiffness
)
.
   
<EOS>
"
Combined
with
these
qualities
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
<EOS>
Fanny
has

manifested
one

made

uneasy

<EOS>
ha

I
must
add
,
angry
;
but
which
I
trust
may
now
be
considered
at
an
end
,
even
as
to
herself
,
and
which
is
undoubtedly
at
an
end
as
to
---
ha

others
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
what
,
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
returned
Mrs
General
,
with
her
gloves
again
somewhat
excited
,
"
can
you
allude
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
at
a
loss
to
---
"
   
"
Do
not
say
that
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
's
voice
,
as
it
died
away
,
pronounced
the
words
,
"
at
a
loss
to
imagine
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
which
Mr
Dorrit
was
seized
with
a
doze
for
about
a
minute
,
out
of
which
he
sprang
with
spasmodic
nimbleness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
refer
,
Mrs
General
,
to
that
---

---
strong
spirit
of
opposition
,
or

I
might

jealousy

<EOS>
"
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
returned
Mrs
General
,
"
is
ever
but
too
obliging
,
ever

appreciative

<EOS>
If
there
have
been
moments
when
I
have
imagined
that
Miss
Dorrit
has
indeed
resented
the
favourable
opinion
Mr

has
formed
of

I
have
found

in

high
opinion

my
consolation

<EOS>
"
Opinion

said
Mr

<EOS>
"

Mrs

repeated
,
in
an
elegantly
impressive
manner
,
"
my

"
   
<EOS>
"
Of

said
Mr
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

retorted
Mrs
General
,
in
her
former
impressive
manner
,
"
of

<EOS>
For

said
Mrs

,
with
a
slightly
interrogative
action
of
her
gloves
,

<EOS>
To

"
was
Mr
Dorrit
's
rejoinder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dorrit
will
pardon
me
,
"
said
Mrs
General
,
"
if
I
remark
that
this
is
not
a

<EOS>
Mr

will
excuse
me
if
I
remind
him
that
Miss

is
in

adjoining
room
,
and
is
visible

utter

<EOS>
Mr

will
forgive

if
I
observe
that

am
agitated
,
and
that
I
find
there
are
moments
when

myself
to

,
return
with
redoubled
power

<EOS>
Mr

will
allow

to
withdraw

"
   
<EOS>
"
Hum

<EOS>
Perhaps
we
may
resume
this
---

interesting
conversation
,
"
said
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
at
another
time
;
unless
it
should
be
,
what
I
hope
it
is
not
---
hum
---
in
any
way
disagreeable
to
---
ah
---
Mrs
General
.
"
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dorrit
,
"
said
Mrs
General
,
casting
down
her
eyes
as
she
rose
with
a
bend
,
"
must
ever
claim
my
homage
and
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
General
then
took
herself
off
in
a
stately
way
,
and
not
with
that
amount
of
trepidation
upon
her
which
might
have
been
expected
in
a
less
remarkable
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
who
had
conducted
his
part
of
the
dialogue
with
a
certain
majestic
and
admiring
condescension
 
---
much
as
some
people
may
be
seen
to
conduct
themselves
in
Church
,
and
to
perform
their
part
in
the
service
---
appeared
,
on
the
whole
,
very
well
satisfied
with
himself
and
with
Mrs
General
too
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
return
of
that
lady
to
tea
,
she
had
touched
herself
up
with
a
little
powder
and
pomatum
,
and
was
not
without
moral
enchantment
likewise
:
<EOS>
the
latter
showing
itself
in
much
sweet
patronage
of
manner
towards
Miss
Dorrit
,
and
in
an
air
of
as
tender
interest
in
Mr
Dorrit
as
was
consistent
with
rigid
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
the
evening
,
when
she
rose
to
retire
,
Mr
Dorrit
took
her
by
the
hand
as
if
he
were
going
to
lead
her
out
into
the
Piazza
of
the
people
to
walk
a
minuet
by
moonlight
,
and
with
great
solemnity
conducted
her
to
the
room
door
,
where
he
raised
her
knuckles
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Having
parted
from
her
with
what
may
be
conjectured
to
have
been
a
rather
bony
kiss
of
a
cosmetic
flavour
,
he
gave
his
daughter
his
blessing
,
graciously
.
 
<EOS>
And
having
thus
hinted
that
there
was
something
remarkable
in
the
wind
,
he
again
went
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
He
remained
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
chamber
next
morning
;
but
,
early
in
the
afternoon
,
sent
down
his
best
compliments
to
Mrs
General
,
by
Mr
Tinkler
,
and
begged
she
would
accompany
Miss
Dorrit
on
an
airing
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
daughter
was
dressed
for
Mrs
Merdle
's
dinner
before
he
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
presented
himself
in
a
refulgent
condition
as
to
his
attire
,
but
looking
indefinably
shrunken
and
old
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
he
was
plainly
determined
to
be
angry
with
her
if
she
so
much
as
asked
him
how
he
was
,
she
only
ventured
to
kiss
his
cheek
,
before
accompanying
him
to
Mrs
Merdle
's
with
an
anxious
heart
.
   
<EOS>
The
distance
that
they
had
to
go
was
very
short
,
but
he
was
at
his
building
work
again
before
the
carriage
had
half
traversed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
received
him
with
great
distinction
;
the
bosom
was
in
admirable
preservation
,
and
on
the
best
terms
with
itself
;
the
dinner
was
very
choice
;
and
the
company
was
very
select
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
principally
English
;
saving
that
it
comprised
the
usual
French
Count

<EOS>
The
table
was
long
,
and
the
dinner
was
long
;
and
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
overshadowed
by
a
large
pair
of
black
whiskers
and
a
large
white
cravat
,
lost
sight
of
her
father
altogether
,
until
a
servant
put
a
scrap
of
paper
in
her
hand
,
with
a
whispered
request
from
Mrs
Merdle
that
she
would
read
it
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
had
written
on
it
in
pencil
,
"
Pray
come
and
speak
to
Mr
Dorrit
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
if
he
is
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
hurrying
to
him
,
unobserved
,
when
he
got
up
out
of
his
chair
,
and
leaning
over
the
table
called
to
her
,
supposing
her
to
be
still
in
her
place
:
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
Amy
,
my
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
action
was
so
unusual
,
to
say
nothing
of
his
strange
eager
appearance
and
strange
eager
voice
,
that
it
instantaneously
caused
a
profound
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amy
,
my
dear
,
"
he
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
and
see
if
Bob
is
on
the
lock
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
at
his
side
,
and
touching
him
,
but
he
still
perversely
supposed
her
to
be
in
her
seat
,
and
called
out
,
still
leaning
over
the
table
,
"
<EOS>
Amy
,
Amy

<EOS>
I
do

quite
myself

<EOS>

Of

<EOS>
See
if
Bob
is
in
the
lodge
,
and
beg
him
to
come
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
All
the
guests
were
now
in
consternation
,
and
everybody
rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
father
,
I
am
not
there
;
I
am
here
,
by
you

"
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
Oh

he
has
been
relieved
,
and
is
not
on
the
lock
,
tell
Mrs
Bangham
to
go
and
fetch
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
gently
trying
to
get
him
away
;
but
he
resisted
,
and
would
not
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
child
,
"
he
said
petulantly
,
"
I
ca
n't

<EOS>
He
looked
confusedly
about
him
,
and
,
becoming
conscious
of
the
number
of
faces
by
which
he
was
surrounded
,
addressed
them
:

She
was
not

of
it

or
ashamed
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
pale
and
frightened
;
but
she
had
no
other

than
to
soothe
him
and
get
him
away

for

She
was
between
him
and
the
wondering
faces
,
turned
round
upon
his
breast
with
her
own
face
raised
to
his

He
held
her
clasped
in

and
between
whiles
her
low
voice
was
heard
tenderly
imploring
him
to

"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
exceeding
mortification
undergone
by
the
Bosom
had
occasioned
the
withdrawal
of
the
greater
part
of
the
company
into
other
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
The
few
who
had
lingered
thus
long
followed
the
rest
,
and
Little
Dorrit
and
her
father
were
left
to
the
servants
and
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Dearest
and
most
precious
to
her
,
he
would
come
with
her
now
,
<EOS>
would
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
He
replied
to
her
fervid
entreaties
,
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
get
up
the
narrow
stairs
without
Bob
;
<EOS>
where
was
Bob
,
would
nobody
fetch
Bob
?
 
<EOS>
Under
pretence
of
looking
for
Bob
,
she
got
him
out
against
the
stream
of
gay
company
now
pouring
in
for
the
evening
assembly
,
and
got
him
into
a
coach
that
had
just
set
down
its
load
,
and
got
him
home
.
   
<EOS>
The
broad
stairs
of
his
Roman
palace
were
contracted
in
his
failing
sight
to
the
narrow
stairs
of
his
London
prison
;
and
he
would
suffer
no
one
but
her
to
touch
him
,
his
brother
excepted
.
 
<EOS>
They
got
him
up
to
his
room
without
help
,
and
laid
him
down
on
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
And
from
that
hour
his
poor
maimed
spirit
,
only
remembering
the
place
where
it
had
broken
its
wings
,
cancelled
the
dream
through
which
it
had
since
groped
,
and
knew
of
nothing
beyond
the
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
street
,
he
took
them
for
the
old
weary
tread
in
the
yards
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
hour
came
for
locking
up
,
he
supposed
all
strangers
to
be
excluded
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
time
for
opening
came
again
,
he
was
so
anxious
to
see
Bob
,
that
they
were
fain
to
patch
up
a
narrative
<EOS>
how
that
Bob
---
many
a
year
dead
then
,
gentle
turnkey
---
had
taken
cold
,
but
hoped
to
be
out
to
-
morrow
,
or
the
next
day
,
or
the
next
at
furthest
.
   
<EOS>
He
fell
away
into
a
weakness
so
extreme
that
he
could
not
raise
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
still
protected
his
brother
according
to
his
long
usage
;
and
would
say
with
some
complacency
,
fifty
times
a
day
,
when
he
saw
him
standing
by
his
bed
,
"
My
good
Frederick
,
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
very
feeble
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
tried
him
with
Mrs
General
,
but
he
had
not
the
faintest
knowledge
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Some
injurious
suspicion
lodged
itself
in
his
brain
,
that
she
wanted
to
supplant
Mrs
Bangham
,
and
that
she
was
given
to
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
He
charged
her
with
it
in
no
measured
terms
;
and
was
so
urgent
with
his
daughter
to
go
round
to
the
Marshal
and
entreat
him
to
turn
her
out
,
that
she
was
never
reproduced
after
the
first
failure
.
<EOS>
Saving
that
he
once
asked
"
if
Tip
had
gone
outside
?
<EOS>
"
the
remembrance
of
his
two
children
not
present
seemed
to
have
departed
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
child
who
had
done
so
much
for
him
and
had
been
so
poorly
repaid
,
was
never
out
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
he
spared
her
,
or
was
fearful
of
her
being
spent
by
watching
and
fatigue
;
he
was
not
more
troubled
on
that
score
than
he
had
usually
been
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
he
loved
her
in
his
old
way
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
in
the
jail
again
,
and
she
tended
him
,
and
he
had
constant
need
of
her
,
and
could
not
turn
without
her
;
and
he
even
told
her
,
sometimes
,
that
he
was
content
to
have
undergone
a
great
deal
for
her
sake
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
her
,
she
bent
over
his
bed
with
her
quiet
face
against
his
,
and
would
have
laid
down
her
own
life
to
restore
him
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
been
sinking
in
this
painless
way
for
two
or
three
days
,
she
observed
him
to
be
troubled
by
the
ticking
of
his
watch
---
a
pompous
gold
watch
that
made
as
great
<EOS>
a
to
-
do
about
its
going
as
if
nothing
else
went
but
itself
and
Time
.
 
<EOS>
She
suffered
it
to
run
down
;
but
he
was
still
uneasy
,
and
showed
that
was
not
what
he
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
roused
himself
to
explain
that
he
wanted
money
to
be
raised
on
this
watch
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
quite
pleased
when
she
pretended
to
take
it
away
for
the
purpose
,
and
afterwards
had
a
relish
for
his
little
tastes
of
wine
and
jelly
,
that
he
had
not
had
before
.
   
<EOS>
He
soon
made
it
plain
that
this
was
so
;
for
,
in
another
day
or
two
he
sent
off
his
sleeve
-
buttons
and
finger
-
rings
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
an
amazing
satisfaction
in
entrusting
her
with
these
errands
,
and
appeared
to
consider
it
equivalent
to
making
the
most
methodical
and
provident
arrangements
.
 
<EOS>
After
his
trinkets
,
or
such
of
them
as
he
had
been
able
to
see
about
him
,
were
gone
,
his
clothes
engaged
his
attention
;
and
it
is
as
likely
as
not
that
he
was
kept
alive
for
some
days
by
the
satisfaction
of
sending
them
,
piece
by
piece
,
to
an
imaginary
pawnbroker
's
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
for
ten
days
Little
Dorrit
bent
over
his
pillow
,
laying
her
cheek
against
his
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
was
so
worn
out
that
for
a
few
minutes
they
would
slumber
together
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
would
awake
;
to
recollect
with
fast
-
flowing
silent
tears
what
it
was
that
touched
her
face
,
and
to
see
,
stealing
over
the
cherished
face
upon
the
pillow
,
a
deeper
shadow
than
the
shadow
of
the
Marshalsea
Wall
.
   
<EOS>
Quietly
,
quietly
,
all
the
lines
of
the
plan
of
the
great
Castle
melted
one
after
another
.
 
<EOS>
Quietly
,
quietly
,
the
ruled
and
cross
-
ruled
countenance
on
which
they
were
traced
,
became
fair
and
blank
.
   
<EOS>
Quietly
,
quietly
,
the
reflected
marks
of
the
prison
bars
and
of
the
zig
-
zag
iron
on
the
wall
-
top
,
faded
away
.
 
<EOS>
Quietly
,
quietly
,
the
face
subsided
into
a
far
younger
likeness
of
her
own
than
she
had
ever
seen
under
the
grey
hair
,
and
sank
to
rest
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
her
uncle
was
stark
distracted
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
my
brother
!
 
<EOS>
O
William
,
William
!
 
<EOS>
You
to
go
before
me
;
you
to
go
alone
;
you
to
go
,
and
I
to
remain
!
 
<EOS>
You
,
so
far
superior
,
so
distinguished
,
so
noble
;
I
,
a
poor
useless
creature
fit
for
nothing
,
and
whom
no
one
would
have
missed
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
did
her
,
for
the
time
,
the
good
of
having
him
to
think
of
and
to
succour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
dear
uncle
,
spare
yourself
,
spare
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
was
not
deaf
to
the
last
words
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
did
begin
to
restrain
himself
,
it
was
that
he
might
spare
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
care
for
himself
;
but
,
with
all
the
remaining
power
of
the
honest
heart
,
stunned
so
long
and
now
awaking
to
be
broken
,
he
honoured
and
blessed
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
God
,
"
he
cried
,
before
they
left
the
room
,
with
his
wrinkled
hands
clasped
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
seest
this
daughter
of
my
dear
dead
brother
!
 
<EOS>
All
that
I
have
looked
upon
,
with
my
half
-
blind
and
sinful
eyes
<EOS>
,
Thou
hast
discerned
clearly
,
brightly
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
hair
of
her
head
shall
be
harmed
before
Thee
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
uphold
her
here
to
her
last
hour
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
know
Thou
wilt
reward
<EOS>
her
hereafter
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
remained
in
a
dim
room
near
,
until
it
was
almost
midnight
,
quiet
and
sad
together
.
 
<EOS>
At
times
his
grief
would
seek
relief
in
a
burst
like
that
in
which
it
had
found
its
earliest
expression
;
but
,
besides
that
his
little
strength
would
soon
have
been
unequal
to
such
strains
,
he
never
failed
to
recall
her
words
,
and
to
reproach
himself
and
calm
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
utterance
with
which
he
indulged
his
sorrow
,
was
the
frequent
exclamation
that
his
brother
was
gone
,
alone
;
that
they
had
been
together
in
the
outset
of
their
lives
,
that
they
had
fallen
into
misfortune
together
,
that
they
had
kept
together
through
their
many
years
of
poverty
,
that
they
had
remained
together
to
that
day
;
and
that
his
brother
was
gone
alone
,
alone
!
   
<EOS>
They
parted
,
heavy
and
sorrowful
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
consent
to
leave
him
anywhere
but
in
his
own
room
,
and
she
saw
him
lie
down
in
his
clothes
upon
his
bed
,
and
covered
him
with
her
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
sank
upon
her
own
bed
,
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
:
<EOS>
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
and
rest
,
though
not
of
complete
release
from
a
pervading
consciousness
of
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
Sleep
,
good
Little
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
Sleep
through
the
night
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
moonlight
night
;
but
the
moon
rose
late
,
being
long
past
the
full
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
high
in
the
peaceful
firmament
,
it
shone
through
half
-
closed
lattice
blinds
into
the
solemn
room
where
the
stumblings
and
wanderings
of
a
life
had
so
lately
ended
.
 
<EOS>
Two
quiet
figures
were
within
the
room
;
two
figures
,
equally
still
and
impassive
,
equally
removed
by
an
untraversable
distance
from
the
teeming
earth
and
all
that
it
contains
,
though
soon
to
lie
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
One
figure
reposed
upon
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
,
kneeling
on
the
floor
,
drooped
over
it
;
the
arms
easily
and
peacefully
resting
on
the
coverlet
;
the
face
bowed
down
,
so
that
the
lips
touched
the
hand
over
which
with
its
last
breath
it
had
bent
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
brothers
were
before
their
Father
;
far
beyond
the
twilight
judgment
of
this
world
;
high
above
its
mists
and
obscurities
.

Introduces
the
next
 
<EOS>
The
passengers
were
landing
from
the
packet
on
the
pier
at
Calais
.
<EOS>
A
low
-
lying
place
and
a
low
-
spirited
place
Calais
was
,
with
the
tide
ebbing
out
towards
low
water
-
mark
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
more
water
on
the
bar
than
had
sufficed
to
float
the
packet
in
;
and
now
the
bar
itself
,
with
a
shallow
break
of
sea
over
it
,
looked
like
a
lazy
marine
monster
just
risen
to
the
surface
,
whose
form
was
indistinctly
shown
as
it
lay
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
meagre
lighthouse
all
in
white
,
haunting
the
seaboard
as
if
it
were
the
ghost
of
an
edifice
that
had
once
had
colour
and
rotundity
,
dropped
melancholy
tears
after
its
late
buffeting
by
the
waves
.
 
<EOS>
The
long
rows
of
gaunt
black
piles
,
slimy
and
wet
and
weather
-
worn
,
with
funeral
garlands
of
seaweed
twisted
about
them
by
the
late
tide
,
might
have
represented
an
unsightly
marine
cemetery
.
 
<EOS>
Every
wave
-
dashed
,
storm
-
beaten
object
,
was
so
low
and
so
little
,
under
the
broad
grey
sky
,
in
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
sea
,
and
before
the
curling
lines
of
surf
,
making
at
it
ferociously
,
that
the
wonder
was
there
was
any
Calais
left
,
and
that
its
low
gates
and
low
wall
and
low
roofs
and
low
ditches
and
low
sand
-
hills
and
low
ramparts
and
flat
streets
,
had
not
yielded
long
ago
to
the
undermining
and
besieging
sea
,
like
the
fortifications
children
make
on
the
sea
-
shore
.
   
<EOS>
After
slipping
among
oozy
piles
and
planks
,
stumbling
up
wet
steps
and
encountering
many
salt
difficulties
,
the
passengers
entered
on
their
comfortless
peregrination
along
the
pier
;
where
all
the
French
vagabonds
and
English
outlaws
in
the
town
(
half
the
population
)
attended
to
prevent
their
recovery
from
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
After
being
minutely
inspected
by
all
the
English
,
and
claimed
and
reclaimed
and
counter
-
claimed
as
prizes
by
all
the
French
in
a
hand
-
to
-
hand
scuffle
three
quarters
of
a
mile
long
,
they
were
at
last
free
to
enter
the
streets
,
and
to
make
off
in
their
various
directions
,
hotly
pursued
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
,
harassed
by
more
anxieties
than
one
,
was
among
this
devoted
band
.
 
<EOS>
Having
rescued
the
most
defenceless
of
his
compatriots
from
situations
of
great
extremity
,
he
now
went
his
way
alone
,
or
as
nearly
alone
as
he
could
be
,
with
a
native
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
grease
and
a
cap
of
the
same
material
,
giving
chase
at
a
distance
of
some
fifty
yards
,
and
continually
calling
after
him
,
"
<EOS>
Hi
!
 
<EOS>
Ice
-
say
!
 
<EOS>
You
!
 
<EOS>
Seer
!
 
<EOS>
Ice
-
say
!
 
<EOS>
Nice
Oatel
!
"
   
<EOS>
Even
this
hospitable
person
,
however
,
was
left
behind
at
last
,
and
Clennam
pursued
his
way
,
unmolested
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
tranquil
air
in
the
town
after
the
turbulence
of
the
Channel
and
the
beach
,
and
its
dulness
in
that
comparison
was
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
He
met
new
groups
of
his
countrymen
,
who
had
all
a
straggling
air
of
having
at
one
time
overblown
themselves
,
like
certain
uncomfortable
kinds
of
flowers
,
and
of
being
now
mere
weeds
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
all
an
air
,
too
,
of
lounging
out
a
limited
round
,
day
after
day
,
which
strongly
reminded
him
of
the
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
taking
no
further
note
of
them
than
was
sufficient
to
give
birth
to
the
reflection
,
he
sought
out
a
certain
street
and
number
which
he
kept
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
Pancks
said
,
"
he
murmured
to
himself
,
as
he
stopped
before
a
dull
house
answering
to
the
address
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
his
information
to
be
correct
and
his
discovery
,
among
Mr
Casby
's
loose
papers
,
indisputable
;
but
,
without
it
,
I
should
hardly
have
supposed
this
to
be
a
likely
place
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
dead
sort
of
house
,
with
a
dead
wall
over
the
way
and
a
dead
gateway
at
the
side
,
where
a
pendant
bell
-
handle
produced
two
dead
tinkles
,
and
a
knocker
produced
a
dead
,
flat
,
surface
-
tapping
,
that
seemed
not
to
have
depth
enough
in
it
to
penetrate
even
the
cracked
door
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
door
jarred
open
on
a
dead
sort
of
spring
;
and
he
closed
it
behind
him
as
he
entered
a
dull
yard
,
soon
brought
to
a
close
by
another
dead
wall
,
where
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
train
some
creeping
shrubs
,
which
were
dead
;
and
to
make
a
little
fountain
in
a
grotto
,
which
was
dry
;
and
to
decorate
that
with
a
little
statue
,
which
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
The
entry
to
the
house
was
on
the
left
,
and
it
was
garnished
as
the
outer
gateway
was
,
with
two
printed
bills
in
French
and
English
,
announcing
Furnished
Apartments
to
let
,
with
immediate
possession
.
<EOS>
A
strong
cheerful
peasant
woman
,
all
stocking
,
petticoat
,
white
cap
,
and
ear
-
ring
,
stood
here
in
a
dark
doorway
,
and
said
with
a
pleasant
show
of
teeth
,
"
Ice
-
say
!
 
<EOS>
Seer
!
 
<EOS>
Who
?
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
,
replying
in
French
,
said
the
English
lady
;
he
wished
to
see
the
English
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enter
then
and
ascend
,
if
you
please
,
"
returned
the
peasant
woman
,
in
French
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
both
,
and
followed
her
up
a
dark
bare
staircase
to
a
back
room
on
the
first
-
floor
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
there
was
a
gloomy
view
of
the
yard
that
was
dull
,
and
of
the
shrubs
that
were
dead
,
and
of
the
fountain
that
was
dry
,
and
of
the
pedestal
of
the
statue
that
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
Blandois
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
pleasure
,
Monsieur
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
woman
withdrew
and
left
him
to
look
at
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
pattern
of
room
always
to
be
found
in
such
a
house
.
 
<EOS>
Cool
,
dull
,
and
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Waxed
floor
very
slippery
.
 
<EOS>
A
room
not
large
enough
to
skate
in
;
nor
adapted
to
the
easy
pursuit
of
any
other
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
Red
and
white
curtained
windows
,
little
straw
mat
,
little
round
table
with
a
tumultuous
assemblage
of
legs
underneath
,
clumsy
rush
-
bottomed
chairs
,
two
great
red
velvet
arm
-
chairs
affording
plenty
of
space
to
be
uncomfortable
in
,
bureau
,
chimney
-
glass
in
several
pieces
pretending
to
be
in
one
piece
,
pair
of
gaudy
vases
of
very
artificial
flowers
;
between
them
a
Greek
warrior
with
his
helmet
off
,
sacrificing
a
clock
to
the
Genius
of
France
.
   
<EOS>
After
some
pause
,
a
door
of
communication
with
another
room
was
opened
,
and
a
lady
entered
.
 
<EOS>
She
manifested
great
surprise
on
seeing
Clennam
,
and
her
glance
went
round
the
room
in
search
of
some
one
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
Miss
Wade
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
your
name
that
was
brought
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
had
experience
that
my
name
does
not
predispose
you
to
an
interview
;
and
I
ventured
to
mention
the
name
of
one
I
am
in
search
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
she
returned
,
motioning
him
to
a
chair
so
coldly
that
he
remained
standing
<EOS>
,
"
what
name
was
it
that
you
gave
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mentioned
the
name
of
Blandois
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Blandois
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
name
you
are
acquainted
with
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
,
"
she
said
,
frowning
,
"
that
you
should
still
press
an
undesired
interest
in
me
and
my
acquaintances
,
in
me
and
my
affairs
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
name
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
have
to
do
with
the
name
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
have
to
do
with
the
name
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
you
have
to
do
with
my
knowing
or
not
knowing
any
name
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
many
names
<EOS>
and
I
have
forgotten
many
more
.
 
<EOS>
This
may
be
in
the
one
class
,
or
it
may
be
in
the
other
,
or
I
may
never
have
heard
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
acquainted
with
no
reason
for
examining
myself
,
or
for
being
examined
,
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
allow
me
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
I
will
tell
you
my
reason
for
pressing
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
admit
that
I
do
press
it
,
and
I
must
beg
you
to
forgive
me
if
I
do
so
,
very
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
The
reason
is
all
mine
,
I
do
not
insinuate
that
it
is
in
any
way
yours
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
she
returned
,
repeating
a
little
less
haughtily
than
before
her
former
invitation
to
him
to
be
seated
:
to
which
he
now
deferred
,
as
she
seated
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
least
glad
to
know
that
this
is
not
another
bondswoman
of
some
friend
of
yours
,
who
is
bereft
of
free
choice
,
and
whom
I
have
spirited
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
hear
your
reason
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
First
,
to
identify
the
person
of
whom
we
speak
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
let
me
observe
that
it
is
the
person
you
met
in
London
some
time
back
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
remember
meeting
him
near
the
river
---
in
the
Adelphi
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
mix
yourself
most
unaccountably
with
my
business
,
"
she
replied
,
looking
full
at
him
with
stern
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
entreat
you
not
to
take
it
ill
.
 
<EOS>
By
mere
accident
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
accident
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Solely
the
accident
of
coming
upon
you
in
the
street
and
seeing
the
meeting
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
speak
of
yourself
,
or
of
some
one
else
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
it
was
in
the
open
street
,
"
she
observed
,
after
a
few
moments
of
less
and
less
angry
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fifty
people
might
have
seen
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
signified
nothing
if
they
had
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
make
my
having
seen
it
of
any
moment
,
nor
(
otherwise
than
as
an
explanation
of
my
coming
here
)
<EOS>
do
I
connect
my
visit
with
it
or
the
favour
that
I
have
to
ask
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
to
ask
a
favour
!
 
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
me
,
"
and
the
handsome
face
looked
bitterly
at
him
,
"
that
your
manner
was
softened
,
Mr
Clennam
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
content
to
protest
against
this
by
a
slight
action
without
contesting
it
in
words
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
referred
to
Blandois
'
disappearance
,
of
which
it
was
probable
<EOS>
she
had
heard
?
 
<EOS>
However
probable
it
was
to
him
,
she
had
heard
of
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
look
round
him
(
she
said
)
and
judge
for
himself
what
general
intelligence
was
likely
to
reach
the
ears
of
a
woman
who
had
been
shut
up
there
while
it
was
rife
,
devouring
her
own
heart
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
uttered
this
denial
,
which
he
believed
to
be
true
,
she
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
disappearance
?
 
<EOS>
That
led
to
his
narrating
the
circumstances
in
detail
,
and
expressing
something
of
his
anxiety
to
discover
what
had
really
become
of
the
man
,
and
to
repel
the
dark
suspicions
that
clouded
about
his
mother
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
heard
him
with
evident
surprise
,
and
with
more
marks
of
suppressed
interest
than
he
had
seen
in
her
;
still
they
did
not
overcome
her
distant
,
proud
,
and
self
-
secluded
manner
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
finished
,
she
said
nothing
but
these
words
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
yet
told
me
,
sir
,
what
I
have
to
do
with
it
,
or
what
the
favour
is
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
be
so
good
as
come
to
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assume
,
"
said
Arthur
,
persevering
,
in
his
endeavour
to
soften
her
scornful
demeanour
,
"
that
being
in
communication
---
may
I
say
,
confidential
communication
?
---
with
this
person
---
"
   
"
You
may
say
,
of
course
,
whatever
you
like
,
"
she
remarked
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
subscribe
to
your
assumptions
,
Mr
Clennam
,
or
to
any
one
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
that
being
,
at
least
in
personal
communication
with
him
,
"
said
Clennam
,
changing
the
form
of
his
position
in
the
hope
of
making
it
unobjectionable
,
"
you
can
tell
me
something
of
his
antecedents
,
pursuits
,
habits
,
usual
place
of
residence
.
 
<EOS>
Can
give
me
some
little
clue
by
which
to
seek
him
out
in
the
likeliest
manner
,
and
either
produce
him
,
or
establish
what
has
become
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
favour
I
ask
,
and
I
ask
it
in
a
distress
of
mind
for
which
I
hope
you
will
feel
some
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
have
any
reason
for
imposing
conditions
upon
me
,
I
will
respect
it
without
asking
what
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
chanced
to
see
me
in
the
street
with
the
man
,
"
she
observed
,
after
being
,
to
his
mortification
,
evidently
more
occupied
with
her
own
reflections
on
the
matter
than
with
his
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
knew
the
man
before
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
before
;
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
before
,
but
I
saw
him
again
on
this
very
night
of
his
disappearance
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
mother
's
room
,
in
fact
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
read
in
this
paper
all
that
is
known
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
handed
her
one
of
the
printed
bills
,
which
she
read
with
a
steady
and
attentive
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
more
than
I
knew
of
him
,
"
she
said
,
giving
it
back
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
's
looks
expressed
his
heavy
disappointment
,
perhaps
his
incredulity
;
for
she
added
in
the
same
unsympathetic
tone
:
"
You
do
n't
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
it
is
so
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
personal
communication
:
it
seems
that
there
was
personal
communication
between
him
and
your
mother
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
you
say
you
believe
her
declaration
that
she
knows
no
more
of
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
sufficiently
expressive
hint
of
suspicion
was
conveyed
in
these
words
,
and
in
the
smile
by
which
they
were
accompanied
,
to
bring
the
blood
into
Clennam
's
cheeks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
sir
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
cruel
pleasure
in
repeating
the
stab
,
"
I
will
be
as
open
with
you
as
you
can
desire
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
confess
that
if
I
cared
for
my
credit
(
which
I
do
not
)
,
or
had
a
good
name
to
preserve
(
which
I
have
not
,
for
I
am
utterly
indifferent
to
its
being
considered
good
or
bad
)
,
I
should
regard
myself
as
heavily
compromised
by
having
had
anything
to
do
with
this
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
never
passed
in
at
MY
door
---
never
sat
in
colloquy
with
ME
until
midnight
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
took
her
revenge
for
her
old
grudge
in
thus
turning
his
subject
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
Hers
was
not
the
nature
to
spare
him
,
and
she
had
no
compunction
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
he
is
a
low
,
mercenary
wretch
;
that
I
first
saw
him
prowling
about
Italy
(
where
I
was
,
not
long
ago
)
,
and
that
I
hired
him
there
,
as
the
suitable
instrument
of
a
purpose
I
happened
to
have
;
I
have
no
objection
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
it
was
worth
my
while
,
for
my
own
pleasure
---
the
gratification
of
a
strong
feeling
---
to
pay
a
spy
who
would
fetch
and
carry
for
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
paid
this
creature
.
<EOS>
And
I
dare
say
that
if
I
had
wanted
to
make
such
a
bargain
,
and
if
I
could
have
paid
him
enough
,
and
if
he
could
have
done
it
in
the
dark
,
free
from
all
risk
,
he
would
have
taken
any
life
with
as
little
scruple
as
he
took
my
money
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
at
least
,
is
my
opinion
of
him
;
and
I
see
it
is
not
very
far
removed
from
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
's
opinion
of
him
<EOS>
,
I
am
to
assume
(
following
your
example
of
assuming
this
and
that
)
,
was
vastly
different
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
mother
,
let
me
remind
you
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
was
first
brought
into
communication
with
him
in
the
unlucky
course
of
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
appears
to
have
been
an
unlucky
course
of
business
that
last
brought
her
into
communication
with
him
,
"
returned
Miss
Wade
;
"
and
business
hours
on
that
occasion
were
late
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
imply
,
"
said
<EOS>
Arthur
,
smarting
under
these
cool
-
handed
thrusts
,
of
which
he
had
deeply
felt
the
force
already
,
"
that
there
was
something
---
"
   
"
Mr
Clennam
,
"
she
composedly
interrupted
,
"
recollect
that
I
do
not
speak
by
implication
about
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
,
I
say
again
without
disguise
,
a
low
mercenary
wretch
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
such
a
creature
goes
where
there
is
occasion
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
had
occasion
for
him
,
you
would
not
have
seen
him
and
me
together
.
"
   
<EOS>
Wrung
by
her
persistence
in
keeping
that
dark
side
of
the
case
before
him
,
of
which
there
was
a
half
-
hidden
shadow
in
his
own
breast
,
Clennam
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
spoken
of
him
as
still
living
,
"
she
added
,
"
but
he
may
have
been
put
out
of
the
way
for
anything
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
For
anything
I
care
,
also
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
further
occasion
for
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
heavy
sigh
and
a
despondent
air
,
Arthur
Clennam
slowly
rose
.
   
<EOS>
She
did
not
rise
also
,
but
said
,
having
looked
at
him
in
the
meanwhile
with
a
fixed
look
of
suspicion
,
and
lips
angrily
compressed
:
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
the
chosen
associate
of
your
dear
friend
,
Mr
Gowan
,
was
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
ask
your
dear
friend
to
help
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
denial
that
he
was
a
dear
friend
rose
to
Arthur
's
lips
;
but
he
repressed
it
,
remembering
his
old
struggles
and
resolutions
,
and
said
:
   
"
Further
than
that
he
has
never
seen
Blandois
since
Blandois
set
out
for
England
,
Mr
Gowan
knows
nothing
additional
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
chance
acquaintance
,
made
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
chance
acquaintance
made
abroad
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Your
dear
friend
has
need
to
divert
himself
with
all
the
acquaintances
he
can
make
,
seeing
what
a
wife
he
has
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
his
wife
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
anger
with
which
she
said
it
,
the
more
remarkable
for
being
so
much
under
her
restraint
,
fixed
Clennam
's
attention
,
and
kept
him
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
It
flashed
out
of
her
dark
eyes
as
they
regarded
him
,
quivered
in
her
nostrils
,
and
fired
the
very
breath
she
exhaled
;
but
her
face
was
otherwise
composed
into
a
disdainful
serenity
;
and
her
attitude
was
as
calmly
and
haughtily
graceful
as
if
she
had
been
in
a
mood
of
complete
indifference
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
I
will
say
is
,
Miss
Wade
,
"
he
remarked
,
"
that
you
can
have
received
no
provocation
to
a
feeling
in
which
I
believe
you
have
no
sharer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
ask
your
dear
friend
,
if
you
choose
,
"
she
returned
,
"
for
his
opinion
upon
that
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
scarcely
on
those
intimate
terms
with
my
dear
friend
,
"
said
Arthur
,
in
spite
of
his
resolutions
,
"
that
would
render
my
approaching
the
subject
very
probable
,
Miss
Wade
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hate
him
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Worse
than
his
wife
,
because
I
was
once
dupe
enough
,
and
false
enough
to
myself
,
almost
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
You
have
seen
me
,
sir
,
only
on
common
-
place
occasions
,
when
I
dare
say
you
have
thought
me
a
common
-
place
woman
,
a
little
more
self
-
willed
than
the
generality
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
what
I
mean
by
hating
,
if
you
know
me
no
better
than
that
;
you
ca
n't
know
,
without
knowing
with
what
care
I
have
studied
myself
and
people
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
reason
I
have
for
some
time
inclined
to
tell
you
what
my
life
has
been
---
not
to
propitiate
your
opinion
,
for
I
set
no
value
on
it
;
but
that
you
may
comprehend
,
when
you
think
of
your
dear
friend
and
his
dear
wife
,
what
I
mean
by
hating
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
give
you
something
I
have
written
and
put
by
for
your
perusal
,
or
shall
I
hold
my
hand
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
begged
her
to
give
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
to
the
bureau
,
unlocked
it
,
and
took
from
an
inner
drawer
a
few
folded
sheets
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
Without
any
conciliation
of
him
,
scarcely
addressing
him
,
rather
speaking
as
if
she
were
speaking
to
her
own
looking
-
glass
for
the
justification
of
her
own
stubbornness
,
she
said
,
as
she
gave
them
to
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
may
know
what
I
mean
by
hating
!
 
<EOS>
No
more
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
whether
you
find
me
temporarily
and
cheaply
lodging
in
an
empty
London
house
,
or
in
a
Calais
apartment
,
you
find
Harriet
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
may
like
to
see
her
before
you
leave
.
 
<EOS>
Harriet
,
come
in
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
called
Harriet
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
call
produced
Harriet
,
once
Tattycoram
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
is
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
Miss
Wade
;
"
not
come
for
you
;
he
has
given
you
up
<EOS>
,
---
I
suppose
you
have
,
by
this
time
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Having
no
authority
,
or
influence
---
yes
,
"
assented
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
come
in
search
of
you
,
you
see
;
but
still
seeking
some
one
.
<EOS>
He
wants
that
Blandois
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
whom
I
saw
you
in
the
Strand
in
London
,
"
hinted
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
know
anything
of
him
,
Harriet
,
except
that
he
came
from
Venice
---
which
we
all
know
---
tell
it
to
Mr
Clennam
freely
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
more
about
him
,
"
said
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
satisfied
?
"
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
inquired
of
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
no
reason
to
disbelieve
them
;
the
girl
's
manner
being
so
natural
as
to
be
almost
convincing
,
if
he
had
had
any
previous
doubts
.
 
<EOS>
He
replied
,
"
I
must
seek
for
intelligence
elsewhere
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
not
going
in
the
same
breath
;
but
he
had
risen
before
the
girl
entered
,
and
she
evidently
thought
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
quickly
at
him
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Are
they
well
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
stopped
herself
in
saying
what
would
have
been
"
all
of
them
;
"
glanced
at
Miss
Wade
;
and
said
"
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
were
,
when
I
last
heard
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
let
me
ask
you
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
true
that
you
were
seen
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
?
 
<EOS>
Where
does
any
one
say
I
was
seen
?
<EOS>
"
returned
the
girl
,
sullenly
casting
down
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Looking
in
at
the
garden
gate
of
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Miss
Wade
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
never
been
near
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
wrong
,
then
,
"
said
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
went
down
there
the
last
time
we
were
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
one
afternoon
when
you
left
me
alone
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
did
look
in
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
poor
-
spirited
girl
,
"
returned
Miss
Wade
with
infinite
contempt
;
"
does
all
our
companionship
,
do
all
our
conversations
,
do
all
your
old
complainings
,
tell
for
so
little
as
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
harm
in
looking
in
at
the
gate
for
an
instant
,
"
said
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
by
the
windows
that
the
family
were
not
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
go
near
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
wanted
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
Because
I
felt
that
I
should
like
to
look
at
it
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
each
of
the
two
handsome
faces
looked
at
the
other
,
Clennam
felt
how
each
of
the
two
natures
must
be
constantly
tearing
the
other
to
pieces
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Miss
Wade
,
coldly
subduing
and
removing
her
glance
;
"
if
you
had
any
desire
to
see
the
place
where
you
led
the
life
from
which
I
rescued
you
because
you
had
found
out
what
it
was
,
that
is
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
But
is
that
your
truth
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Is
that
your
fidelity
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Is
that
the
common
cause
I
make
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
worth
the
confidence
I
have
placed
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
worth
the
favour
I
have
shown
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
no
higher
than
a
spaniel
,
and
had
better
go
back
to
the
people
who
did
worse
than
whip
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
speak
so
of
them
with
any
one
else
by
to
hear
,
you
'll
provoke
me
to
take
their
part
,
"
said
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
back
to
them
,
"
Miss
Wade
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
back
to
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
very
well
,
"
retorted
Harriet
in
her
turn
,
"
that
I
wo
n't
go
back
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
I
have
thrown
them
off
,
and
never
can
,
never
shall
,
never
will
,
go
back
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
alone
,
then
,
Miss
Wade
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
prefer
their
plenty
to
your
less
fat
living
here
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
exalt
them
,
and
slight
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
else
should
I
have
expected
?
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
known
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
so
,
"
said
the
girl
,
flushing
high
,
"
and
you
do
n't
say
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
reproaching
me
,
underhanded
,
with
having
nobody
but
you
to
look
to
.
 
<EOS>
And
because
I
have
nobody
but
<EOS>
you
to
look
to
<EOS>
,
you
think
you
are
to
make
me
do
,
or
not
do
,
everything
you
please
,
and
are
to
put
any
affront
upon
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
as
bad
as
they
were
,
every
bit
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
be
quite
tamed
,
and
made
submissive
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
again
that
I
went
to
look
at
the
house
,
because
I
had
often
thought
that
I
should
like
to
see
it
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
ask
again
how
they
are
,
because
I
once
liked
them
and
at
times
thought
they
were
kind
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Hereupon
Clennam
said
that
he
was
sure
they
would
still
receive
her
kindly
,
if
she
should
ever
desire
to
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
said
the
girl
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
do
that
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
that
better
than
Miss
Wade
,
though
she
taunts
me
because
she
has
made
me
her
dependent
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
know
I
am
so
<EOS>
;
and
I
know
<EOS>
she
is
overjoyed
when
she
can
bring
it
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
good
pretence
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Wade
,
with
no
less
anger
,
haughtiness
,
and
bitterness
;
"
but
too
threadbare
to
cover
what
I
plainly
see
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
My
poverty
will
not
bear
competition
with
their
money
.
<EOS>
Better
go
back
at
once
,
better
go
back
at
once
,
and
have
done
with
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
looked
at
them
,
standing
a
little
distance
asunder
in
the
dull
confined
room
,
each
proudly
cherishing
her
own
anger
;
each
,
with
a
fixed
determination
,
torturing
her
own
breast
,
and
torturing
the
other
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
a
word
or
two
of
leave
-
taking
;
but
Miss
Wade
barely
inclined
her
head
,
and
Harriet
,
with
the
assumed
humiliation
of
an
abject
dependent
and
serf
(
but
not
without
defiance
for
all
that
)
,
made
as
if
she
were
too
low
to
notice
or
to
be
noticed
.
   
<EOS>
He
came
down
the
dark
winding
stairs
into
the
yard
with
an
increased
sense
upon
him
of
the
gloom
of
the
wall
that
was
dead
,
and
of
the
shrubs
that
were
dead
,
and
of
the
fountain
that
was
dry
,
and
of
the
statue
that
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Pondering
much
on
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
in
that
house
,
as
well
as
on
the
failure
of
all
his
efforts
to
trace
the
suspicious
character
who
was
lost
,
he
returned
to
London
and
to
England
by
the
packet
that
had
taken
him
over
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
way
he
unfolded
the
sheets
of
paper
,
and
read
in
them
what
is
reproduced
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
21

<EOS>
The
History
of
a
Self
-
Tormentor
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
misfortune
of
not
being
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
From
a
very
early
age
I
have
detected
what
those
about
me
thought
they
hid
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
been
habitually
imposed
upon
,
instead
of
habitually
discerning
the
truth
,
I
might
have
lived
as
smoothly
as
most
fools
do
.
   
<EOS>
My
childhood
was
passed
with
a
grandmother
;
that
is
to
say
,
with
a
lady
who
represented
that
relative
to
me
,
and
who
took
that
title
on
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
claim
to
it
,
but
<EOS>
I
---
being
to
that
extent
a
little
fool
---
had
no
suspicion
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
some
children
of
her
own
family
in
her
house
,
and
some
children
of
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
All
girls
;
ten
in
number
,
including
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
lived
together
and
were
educated
together
.
   
<EOS>
I
must
have
been
about
twelve
years
old
when
I
began
to
see
how
determinedly
those
girls
patronised
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
told
I
was
an
orphan
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
orphan
among
us
;
and
I
perceived
<EOS>
(
here
was
the
first
disadvantage
of
not
being
a
fool
)
<EOS>
that
they
conciliated
me
in
an
insolent
pity
,
and
in
a
sense
of
superiority
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
set
this
down
as
a
discovery
,
rashly
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
them
often
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
make
them
quarrel
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
succeeded
with
any
of
them
,
they
were
sure
to
come
after
an
hour
or
two
,
and
begin
a
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
them
over
and
over
again
,
and
I
never
knew
them
wait
for
me
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
always
forgiving
me
,
in
their
vanity
and
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
Little
images
of
grown
people
!
   
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
my
chosen
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
that
stupid
mite
in
a
passionate
way
that
she
could
no
more
deserve
than
I
can
remember
without
feeling
ashamed
of
,
though
I
was
but
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
what
they
called
an
amiable
temper
,
an
affectionate
temper
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
distribute
,
and
did
distribute
pretty
looks
and
smiles
to
every
one
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
place
,
except
myself
,
who
knew
that
she
did
it
purposely
to
wound
and
gall
me
!
   
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
so
loved
that
unworthy
girl
that
my
life
was
made
stormy
by
my
fondness
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
constantly
lectured
and
disgraced
for
what
was
called
"
trying
her
;
"
in
other
words
charging
her
with
her
little
perfidy
and
throwing
her
into
tears
by
showing
her
that
I
read
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
loved
her
faithfully
;
and
one
time
I
went
home
with
her
for
the
holidays
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
worse
at
home
than
she
had
been
at
school
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
crowd
of
cousins
and
acquaintances
,
and
we
had
dances
at
her
house
,
and
went
out
to
dances
at
other
houses
,
and
,
both
at
home
and
out
<EOS>
,
she
tormented
my
love
beyond
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
Her
plan
was
,
to
make
them
all
fond
of
her
---
and
so
drive
me
wild
with
jealousy
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
familiar
and
endearing
with
them
all
---
and
so
make
me
mad
with
envying
them
.
<EOS>
When
we
were
left
alone
in
our
bedroom
at
night
,
I
would
reproach
her
with
my
perfect
knowledge
of
her
baseness
;
and
then
she
would
cry
and
cry
and
say
I
was
cruel
,
and
then
I
would
hold
her
in
my
arms
till
morning
:
loving
her
as
much
as
ever
,
and
often
feeling
as
if
,
rather
than
suffer
<EOS>
so
,
I
could
so
hold
her
in
my
arms
and
plunge
to
the
bottom
of
a
river
---
where
I
would
still
hold
her
after
we
were
both
dead
.
   
<EOS>
It
came
to
an
end
,
and
I
was
relieved
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
family
there
was
an
aunt
who
was
not
fond
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
any
of
the
family
liked
me
much
;
but
I
never
wanted
them
to
like
me
,
being
altogether
bound
up
in
the
one
girl
.
 
<EOS>
The
aunt
was
a
young
woman
,
and
she
had
a
serious
way
with
her
eyes
of
watching
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
an
audacious
woman
,
and
openly
looked
compassionately
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
After
one
of
the
nights
that
I
have
spoken
of
,
I
came
down
into
a
greenhouse
before
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
(
the
name
of
my
false
young
friend
)
had
gone
down
before
me
,
and
I
heard
this
aunt
speaking
to
her
about
me
as
I
entered
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
where
I
was
,
among
the
leaves
,
and
listened
.
   
<EOS>
The
aunt
said
,
"
Charlotte
,
Miss
Wade
is
wearing
you
to
death
,
and
this
must
not
continue
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
very
words
I
heard
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
what
did
she
answer
?
 
<EOS>
Did
she
say
,
"
It
is
I
who
am
wearing
her
to
death
,
I
who
am
keeping
her
on
a
rack
and
am
the
executioner
,
yet
she
tells
me
every
night
that
she
loves
me
devotedly
,
though
she
knows
what
I
make
her
undergo
?
"
 
<EOS>
No
;
my
first
memorable
experience
was
true
to
what
I
knew
her
to
be
,
and
to
all
my
experience
.
 
<EOS>
She
began
sobbing
and
weeping
(
to
secure
the
aunt
's
sympathy
to
herself
)
,
and
said
,
"
Dear
aunt
,
she
has
an
unhappy
temper
;
other
girls
at
school
,
besides
I
,
try
hard
to
make
it
better
;
we
all
try
hard
.
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
that
the
aunt
fondled
her
,
as
if
she
had
said
something
noble
instead
of
despicable
and
false
,
and
kept
up
the
infamous
pretence
by
replying
,
"
But
there
are
reasonable
limits
,
my
dear
love
,
to
everything
,
and
I
see
that
this
poor
miserable
girl
causes
you
more
constant
and
useless
distress
than
even
so
good
an
effort
justifies
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
poor
miserable
girl
came
out
of
her
concealment
,
as
you
may
be
prepared
to
hear
,
and
said
,
"
Send
me
home
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
never
said
another
word
to
either
of
them
,
or
to
any
of
them
,
but
"
Send
me
home
,
or
I
will
walk
home
alone
,
night
and
day
!
"
 
<EOS>
When
I
got
home
,
I
told
my
supposed
grandmother
that
,
unless
I
was
sent
away
to
finish
my
education
somewhere
else
before
that
girl
came
back
,
or
before
any
one
of
them
came
back
,
I
would
burn
my
sight
away
by
throwing
myself
into
the
fire
,
rather
than
I
would
endure
to
look
at
their
plotting
faces
.
   
<EOS>
I
went
among
young
women
next
,
and
I
found
them
no
better
.
 
<EOS>
Fair
words
and
fair
pretences
;
but
I
penetrated
below
those
assertions
of
themselves
and
depreciations
of
me
,
and
they
were
no
better
.
<EOS>
Before
I
left
them
,
I
learned
that
I
had
no
grandmother
and
no
recognised
relation
.
 
<EOS>
I
carried
the
light
of
that
information
both
into
my
past
and
into
my
future
.
 
<EOS>
It
showed
me
many
new
occasions
on
which
people
triumphed
over
me
,
when
they
made
a
pretence
of
treating
me
with
consideration
,
or
doing
me
a
service
.
   
<EOS>
A
man
of
business
had
a
small
property
in
trust
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
be
a
governess
;
I
became
a
governess
;
and
went
into
the
family
of
a
poor
nobleman
,
where
there
were
two
daughters
---
little
children
,
but
the
parents
wished
them
to
grow
up
,
if
possible
,
under
one
instructress
.
 
<EOS>
The
mother
was
young
and
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
first
,
she
made
a
show
of
behaving
to
me
with
great
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
I
kept
my
resentment
to
myself
;
but
I
knew
very
well
that
it
was
her
way
of
petting
the
knowledge
that
she
was
my
Mistress
,
and
might
have
behaved
differently
to
her
servant
if
it
had
been
her
fancy
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
I
did
not
resent
it
,
nor
did
I
;
but
I
showed
her
,
by
not
gratifying
her
,
that
I
understood
her
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
pressed
me
to
take
wine
,
I
took
water
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
happened
to
be
anything
choice
at
table
,
she
always
sent
it
to
me
:
but
I
always
declined
it
,
and
ate
of
the
rejected
dishes
.
 
<EOS>
These
disappointments
of
her
patronage
were
a
sharp
retort
,
and
made
me
feel
independent
.
   
<EOS>
I
liked
the
children
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
timid
,
but
on
the
whole
disposed
to
attach
themselves
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
nurse
,
however
,
in
the
house
,
a
rosy
-
faced
woman
always
making
an
obtrusive
pretence
of
being
gay
and
good
-
humoured
,
who
had
nursed
them
both
,
and
who
had
secured
their
affections
before
I
saw
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
almost
have
settled
down
to
my
fate
but
for
this
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Her
artful
devices
for
keeping
herself
before
the
children
in
constant
competition
with
me
,
might
have
blinded
many
in
my
place
;
but
I
saw
through
them
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
pretext
of
arranging
my
rooms
and
waiting
on
me
and
taking
care
of
my
wardrobe
(
all
of
which
she
did
busily
)
,
she
was
never
absent
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
crafty
of
her
many
subtleties
was
her
feint
of
seeking
to
make
the
children
fonder
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
lead
them
to
me
and
coax
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
to
good
Miss
Wade
,
come
to
dear
Miss
Wade
,
come
to
pretty
Miss
Wade
.
 
<EOS>
She
loves
you
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
is
a
clever
lady
,
who
has
read
heaps
of
books
,
and
can
tell
you
far
better
and
more
interesting
stories
than
I
know
.
<EOS>
Come
and
hear
Miss
Wade
!
"
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
engage
their
attentions
,
when
my
heart
was
burning
against
these
ignorant
designs
?
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
wonder
,
when
I
saw
their
innocent
faces
shrinking
away
,
and
their
arms
twining
round
her
neck
,
instead
of
mine
?
 
<EOS>
Then
she
would
look
up
at
me
,
shaking
their
curls
from
her
face
,
and
say
,
"
They
'll
come
round
soon
,
Miss
Wade
;
they
're
very
simple
and
loving
,
ma'am
;
do
n't
be
at
all
cast
down
about
it
,
ma'am
"
---
exulting
over
me
!
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
thing
the
woman
did
.
 
<EOS>
At
times
,
when
she
saw
that
she
had
safely
plunged
me
into
a
black
despondent
brooding
by
these
means
,
she
would
call
the
attention
of
the
children
to
it
,
and
would
show
them
the
difference
between
herself
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Wade
is
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
make
a
noise
,
my
dears
,
her
head
aches
.
 
<EOS>
Come
and
comfort
her
.
 
<EOS>
Come
and
ask
her
if
she
is
better
;
come
and
ask
her
to
lie
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
nothing
on
your
mind
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
take
on
,
ma'am
,
and
be
sorry
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
became
intolerable
.
 
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
,
my
Mistress
,
coming
in
one
day
when
I
was
alone
,
and
at
the
height
of
feeling
that
I
could
support
it
no
longer
,
I
told
her
I
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
the
presence
of
that
woman
Dawes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Wade
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dawes
is
devoted
to
you
;
would
do
anything
for
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
knew
beforehand
<EOS>
she
would
say
so
<EOS>
;
I
was
quite
prepared
for
it
;
I
only
answered
,
it
was
not
for
me
to
contradict
my
Mistress
;
I
must
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Miss
Wade
,
"
she
returned
,
instantly
assuming
the
tone
of
superiority
she
had
always
so
thinly
concealed
,
"
that
nothing
I
have
ever
said
or
done
since
we
have
been
together
,
has
justified
your
use
of
that
disagreeable
word
,
"
Mistress
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
wholly
inadvertent
on
my
part
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
tell
me
what
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
that
I
had
no
complaint
to
make
,
either
of
my
Mistress
or
to
my
Mistress
;
but
I
must
go
.
   
<EOS>
She
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
sat
down
beside
me
,
and
laid
her
hand
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
that
honour
would
obliterate
any
remembrance
!
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Wade
,
I
fear
you
are
unhappy
,
through
causes
over
which
I
have
no
influence
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
smiled
,
thinking
of
the
experience
the
word
awakened
,
and
said
,
"
I
have
an
unhappy
temper
,
I
suppose
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
easy
way
of
accounting
for
anything
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
;
but
I
did
not
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
wish
to
approach
is
something
very
different
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
and
I
have
exchanged
some
remarks
upon
the
subject
,
when
we
have
observed
with
pain
that
you
have
not
been
easy
with
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Easy
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
such
great
people
,
my
lady
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
unfortunate
in
using
a
word
which
may
convey
a
meaning
---
and
evidently
does
---
quite
opposite
to
my
intention
.
"
 
<EOS>
(
She
had
not
expected
my
reply
,
and
it
shamed
her
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
only
mean
,
not
happy
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
difficult
topic
to
enter
on
;
but
,
from
one
young
woman
to
another
,
perhaps
---
in
short
,
we
have
been
apprehensive
that
you
may
allow
some
family
circumstances
of
which
no
one
can
be
more
innocent
than
yourself
,
to
prey
upon
your
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
let
us
entreat
you
not
to
make
them
a
cause
of
grief
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
himself
,
as
is
well
known
,
formerly
had
a
very
dear
sister
who
was
not
in
law
his
sister
,
but
who
was
universally
beloved
and
respected
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
directly
that
they
had
taken
me
in
for
the
sake
of
the
dead
woman
,
whoever
she
was
,
and
to
have
that
boast
of
me
and
advantage
of
me
;
I
saw
,
in
the
nurse
's
knowledge
of
it
,
an
encouragement
to
goad
me
as
she
had
done
;
and
I
saw
,
in
the
children
's
shrinking
away
,
a
vague
impression
,
that
I
was
not
like
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
that
house
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
After
one
or
two
short
and
very
similar
experiences
,
which
are
not
to
the
present
purpose
,
I
entered
another
family
where
I
had
but
<EOS>
one
pupil
:
a
girl
of
fifteen
,
who
was
the
only
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
The
parents
here
were
elderly
people
:
people
of
station
,
and
rich
.
 
<EOS>
A
nephew
whom
they
had
brought
up
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
house
,
among
many
other
visitors
;
and
he
began
to
pay
me
attention
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
resolute
in
repulsing
him
;
for
I
had
determined
when
I
went
there
,
that
no
one
should
pity
me
or
condescend
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
wrote
me
a
letter
.
 
<EOS>
It
led
to
our
being
engaged
to
be
married
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
year
younger
than
I
,
and
young
-
looking
even
when
that
allowance
was
made
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
absence
from
India
,
where
he
had
a
post
that
was
soon
to
grow
into
a
very
good
one
.
 
<EOS>
In
six
months
we
were
to
be
married
,
and
were
to
go
to
India
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
stay
in
the
house
,
and
was
to
be
married
from
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
objected
to
any
part
of
the
plan
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
avoid
saying
he
admired
me
;
but
,
if
I
could
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
Vanity
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
declaration
,
for
his
admiration
worried
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
no
pains
to
hide
it
;
and
caused
me
to
feel
among
the
rich
people
as
if
he
had
bought
me
for
my
looks
,
and
made
a
show
of
his
purchase
to
justify
himself
.
 
<EOS>
They
appraised
me
in
their
own
minds
,
I
saw
,
and
were
curious
to
ascertain
what
my
full
value
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
resolved
that
they
should
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
immovable
and
silent
before
them
;
and
would
have
suffered
any
one
of
them
to
kill
me
sooner
than
I
would
have
laid
myself
out
to
bespeak
their
approval
.
   
<EOS>
He
told
me
I
did
not
do
myself
justice
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
did
,
and
it
was
because
I
did
and
meant
to
do
so
to
the
last
,
that
I
would
not
stoop
to
propitiate
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
concerned
and
even
shocked
,
when
I
added
that
I
wished
he
would
not
parade
his
attachment
before
them
;
but
he
said
he
would
sacrifice
even
the
honest
impulses
of
his
affection
to
my
peace
.
   
<EOS>
Under
that
pretence
he
began
to
retort
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
hour
together
,
he
would
keep
at
a
distance
from
me
,
talking
to
any
one
rather
than
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sat
alone
and
unnoticed
,
half
an
evening
,
while
he
conversed
with
his
young
cousin
,
my
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
all
the
while
,
in
people
's
eyes
,
that
they
thought
the
two
looked
nearer
on
an
equality
than
he
and
I.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sat
,
divining
their
thoughts
,
until
I
have
felt
that
his
young
appearance
made
me
ridiculous
,
and
have
raged
against
myself
for
ever
loving
him
.
   
<EOS>
For
I
did
love
him
once
.
 
<EOS>
Undeserving
as
he
was
,
and
little
as
he
thought
of
all
these
agonies
that
it
cost
me
---
agonies
which
should
have
made
him
wholly
and
gratefully
mine
to
his
life
's
end
---
I
loved
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
bore
with
his
cousin
's
praising
him
to
my
face
,
and
with
her
pretending
to
think
that
it
pleased
me
,
but
full
well
knowing
that
it
rankled
in
my
breast
;
for
his
sake
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
have
sat
in
his
presence
recalling
all
my
slights
and
wrongs
,
and
deliberating
whether
I
should
not
fly
from
the
house
at
once
and
never
see
him
again
---
I
have
loved
him
.
   
<EOS>
His
aunt
(
my
Mistress
you
will
please
to
remember
)
<EOS>
deliberately
,
wilfully
,
added
to
my
trials
and
vexations
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
her
delight
to
expatiate
on
the
style
in
which
we
were
to
live
in
India
,
and
on
the
establishment
we
should
keep
,
and
the
company
we
should
entertain
when
he
got
his
advancement
.
 
<EOS>
My
pride
rose
against
this
barefaced
way
of
pointing
out
the
contrast
my
married
life
was
to
present
to
my
then
dependent
and
inferior
position
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppressed
my
indignation
;
but
I
showed
her
that
her
intention
was
not
lost
upon
me
,
and
I
repaid
her
annoyance
by
affecting
humility
.
 
<EOS>
What
she
described
would
surely
be
a
great
deal
too
much
honour
for
me
,
I
would
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
I
might
not
be
able
to
support
so
great
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
a
mere
governess
,
her
daughter
's
governess
,
coming
to
that
high
distinction
!
 
<EOS>
It
made
her
uneasy
,
and
made
them
all
uneasy
,
when
I
answered
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
They
knew
that
I
fully
understood
her
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
time
when
my
troubles
were
at
their
highest
,
and
when
I
was
most
incensed
against
my
lover
for
his
ingratitude
in
caring
as
little
as
he
did
for
the
innumerable
distresses
and
mortifications
I
underwent
on
his
account
,
that
your
dear
friend
,
Mr
Gowan
,
appeared
at
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
intimate
there
for
a
long
time
,
but
had
been
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
He
understood
the
state
of
things
at
a
glance
,
and
he
understood
me
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
the
first
person
I
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
who
had
understood
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
in
the
house
three
times
before
I
knew
that
he
accompanied
every
movement
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
coldly
easy
way
with
all
of
them
,
and
with
me
,
and
with
the
whole
subject
,
I
saw
it
clearly
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
light
protestations
of
admiration
of
my
future
husband
,
in
his
enthusiasm
regarding
our
engagement
and
our
prospects
,
in
his
hopeful
congratulations
on
our
future
wealth
and
his
despondent
references
to
his
own
poverty
---
all
equally
hollow
,
and
jesting
,
and
full
of
mockery
<EOS>
---
I
saw
it
clearly
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
me
feel
more
and
more
resentful
,
and
more
and
more
contemptible
,
by
always
presenting
to
me
everything
that
surrounded
me
with
some
new
hateful
light
upon
it
,
while
he
pretended
to
exhibit
it
in
its
best
aspect
for
my
admiration
and
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
like
the
dressed
-
up
Death
in
the
Dutch
series
;
whatever
figure
he
took
upon
his
arm
,
whether
it
was
youth
or
age
,
beauty
or
ugliness
,
whether
he
danced
with
it
,
sang
with
it
,
played
with
it
,
or
prayed
with
it
,
he
made
it
ghastly
.
   
<EOS>
You
will
understand
,
then
,
that
when
your
dear
friend
complimented
me
,
he
really
condoled
with
me
;
that
when
he
soothed
me
under
my
vexations
,
he
laid
bare
every
smarting
wound
I
had
;
that
when
he
declared
my
"
faithful
swain
"
to
be
"
the
most
loving
young
fellow
in
the
world
,
with
the
tenderest
heart
that
ever
beat
,
"
he
touched
my
old
misgiving
that
I
was
made
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
not
great
services
,
you
may
say
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
acceptable
to
me
,
because
they
echoed
my
own
mind
,
and
confirmed
my
own
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
began
to
like
the
society
of
your
dear
friend
better
than
any
other
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
perceived
(
which
I
did
,
almost
as
soon
)
that
jealousy
was
growing
out
of
this
,
I
liked
this
society
still
better
.
 
<EOS>
Had
I
not
been
subject
to
jealousy
,
and
were
the
endurances
to
be
all
mine
?
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
know
what
it
was
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
delighted
that
he
should
know
it
;
I
was
delighted
that
he
should
feel
keenly
,
and
I
hoped
he
did
.
   
<EOS>
More
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
tame
in
comparison
with
Mr
Gowan
,
who
knew
how
to
address
me
on
equal
terms
,
and
how
to
anatomise
the
wretched
people
around
us
.
   
<EOS>
This
went
on
,
until
the
aunt
,
my
Mistress
,
took
it
upon
herself
to
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
scarcely
worth
alluding
to
;
she
knew
I
meant
nothing
;
but
she
suggested
from
herself
,
knowing
it
was
only
necessary
to
suggest
,
that
it
might
be
better
if
I
were
a
little
less
companionable
with
Mr
Gowan
.
   
<EOS>
I
asked
her
how
she
could
answer
for
what
I
meant
?
 
<EOS>
She
could
always
answer
,
she
replied
,
for
my
meaning
nothing
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
thanked
her
,
but
said
I
would
prefer
to
answer
for
myself
and
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Her
other
servants
would
probably
be
grateful
for
good
characters
,
but
I
wanted
none
.
   
<EOS>
Other
conversation
followed
,
and
induced
me
to
ask
her
how
she
knew
that
it
was
only
necessary
for
her
to
make
a
suggestion
to
me
,
to
have
it
obeyed
?
 
<EOS>
Did
she
presume
on
my
birth
,
or
on
my
hire
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
bought
,
body
and
soul
.
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
think
that
her
distinguished
nephew
had
gone
into
a
slave
-
market
and
purchased
a
wife
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
probably
have
come
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
the
end
to
which
it
did
come
,
but
she
brought
it
to
its
issue
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
me
,
with
assumed
commiseration
,
that
I
had
an
unhappy
temper
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
repetition
of
the
old
wicked
injury
,
I
withheld
no
longer
,
but
exposed
to
her
all
I
had
known
of
her
and
seen
in
her
,
and
all
I
had
undergone
within
myself
since
I
had
occupied
the
despicable
position
of
being
engaged
to
her
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
Mr
Gowan
was
the
only
relief
I
had
had
in
my
degradation
;
that
I
had
borne
it
too
long
,
and
that
I
shook
it
off
too
late
;
but
that
I
would
see
none
of
them
more
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
never
did
.
<EOS>
Your
dear
friend
followed
me
to
my
retreat
,
and
was
very
droll
on
the
severance
of
the
connection
;
though
he
was
sorry
,
too
,
for
the
excellent
people
(
in
their
way
the
best
he
had
ever
met
)
,
and
deplored
the
necessity
of
breaking
mere
house
-
flies
on
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
He
protested
before
long
,
and
far
more
truly
than
I
then
supposed
,
that
he
was
not
worth
acceptance
by
a
woman
of
such
endowments
,
and
such
power
of
character
;
but
---
well
,
well
!
<EOS>
---
   
<EOS>
Your
dear
friend
amused
me
and
amused
himself
as
long
as
it
suited
his
inclinations
;
and
then
reminded
me
that
we
were
both
people
of
the
world
,
that
we
both
understood
mankind
,
that
we
both
knew
there
was
no
such
thing
as
romance
,
that
we
were
both
prepared
for
going
different
ways
to
seek
our
fortunes
like
people
of
sense
,
and
that
we
both
foresaw
that
whenever
we
encountered
one
another
again
we
should
meet
as
the
best
friends
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
said
,
<EOS>
and
I
did
not
contradict
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
before
I
found
that
he
was
courting
his
present
wife
,
and
that
she
had
been
taken
away
to
be
out
of
his
reach
.
 
<EOS>
I
hated
her
then
,
quite
as
much
as
I
hate
her
now
;
and
naturally
,
therefore
,
could
desire
nothing
better
than
that
she
should
marry
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
restlessly
curious
to
look
at
her
---
so
curious
that
I
felt
it
to
be
one
of
the
few
sources
of
entertainment
left
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
travelled
a
little
:
travelled
until
I
found
myself
in
her
society
,
and
in
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Your
dear
friend
,
I
think
,
was
not
known
to
you
then
,
and
had
not
given
you
any
of
those
signal
marks
of
his
friendship
which
he
has
bestowed
upon
you
.
   
<EOS>
In
that
company
I
found
a
girl
,
in
various
circumstances
of
whose
position
there
was
a
singular
likeness
to
my
own
,
and
in
whose
character
I
was
interested
and
pleased
to
see
much
of
the
rising
against
swollen
patronage
and
selfishness
,
calling
themselves
kindness
,
protection
,
benevolence
,
and
other
fine
names
,
which
I
have
described
as
inherent
in
my
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
heard
it
said
,
too
,
that
she
had
"
an
unhappy
temper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Well
understanding
what
was
meant
by
the
convenient
phrase
,
and
wanting
a
companion
with
a
knowledge
of
what
I
knew
,
I
thought
I
would
try
to
release
the
girl
from
her
bondage
and
sense
of
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
occasion
to
relate
that
I
succeeded
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
been
together
ever
since
,
sharing
my
small
means
.

Chapter
22
.
<EOS>
Who
passes
by
this
Road
so
late
?
 
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
had
made
his
unavailing
expedition
to
Calais
in
the
midst
of
a
great
pressure
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
barbaric
Power
with
valuable
possessions
on
the
map
of
the
world
,
had
occasion
for
the
services
of
one
or
two
engineers
,
quick
in
invention
and
determined
in
execution
:
practical
men
,
who
could
make
the
men
and
means
their
ingenuity
perceived
to
be
wanted
out
of
the
best
materials
they
could
find
at
hand
;
and
who
were
as
bold
and
fertile
in
the
adaptation
of
such
materials
to
their
purpose
,
as
in
the
conception
of
their
purpose
itself
.
 
<EOS>
This
Power
,
being
a
barbaric
one
,
had
no
idea
of
stowing
away
a
great
national
object
in
a
Circumlocution
Office
,
as
strong
wine
is
hidden
from
the
light
in
a
cellar
until
its
fire
and
youth
are
gone
,
and
the
labourers
who
worked
in
the
vineyard
and
pressed
the
grapes
are
dust
.
 
<EOS>
With
characteristic
ignorance
,
it
acted
on
the
most
decided
and
energetic
notions
of
How
to
do
it
;
and
never
showed
the
least
respect
for
,
or
gave
any
quarter
to
,
the
great
political
science
,
How
not
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
it
had
a
barbarous
way
of
striking
the
latter
art
and
mystery
dead
,
in
the
person
of
any
enlightened
subject
who
practised
it
.
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
men
who
were
wanted
were
sought
out
and
found
;
which
was
in
itself
a
most
uncivilised
and
irregular
way
of
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
Being
found
,
they
were
treated
with
great
confidence
and
honour
(
which
again
showed
dense
political
ignorance
)
,
and
were
invited
to
come
at
once
and
do
what
they
had
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
they
were
regarded
as
men
who
meant
to
do
it
,
engaging
with
other
men
who
meant
it
to
be
done
.
   
<EOS>
Daniel
Doyce
was
one
of
the
chosen
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
foreseeing
at
that
time
whether
he
would
be
absent
months
or
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparations
for
his
departure
,
and
the
conscientious
arrangement
for
him
of
all
the
details
and
results
of
their
joint
business
,
had
necessitated
labour
within
a
short
compass
of
time
,
which
had
occupied
Clennam
day
and
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
slipped
across
the
water
in
his
first
leisure
,
and
had
slipped
as
quickly
back
again
for
his
farewell
interview
with
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
Him
Arthur
now
showed
,
with
pains
and
care
,
the
state
of
their
gains
and
losses
,
responsibilities
and
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
Daniel
went
through
it
all
in
his
patient
manner
,
and
admired
it
all
exceedingly
.
 
<EOS>
He
audited
the
accounts
,
as
if
they
were
a
far
more
ingenious
piece
of
mechanism
than
he
had
ever
constructed
,
and
afterwards
stood
looking
at
them
,
weighing
his
hat
over
his
head
by
the
brims
,
as
if
he
were
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
some
wonderful
engine
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
beautiful
,
Clennam
,
in
its
regularity
and
order
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
plainer
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
approve
,
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
as
to
the
management
of
your
capital
while
you
are
away
,
and
as
to
the
conversion
of
so
much
of
it
as
the
business
may
need
from
time
to
time
---
"
His
partner
stopped
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
that
,
and
as
to
everything
else
of
that
kind
,
all
rests
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
continue
in
all
such
matters
to
act
for
both
of
us
,
as
you
have
done
hitherto
,
and
to
lighten
my
mind
of
a
load
<EOS>
it
is
much
relieved
from
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Though
,
as
I
often
tell
you
,
"
returned
Clennam
,
"
you
unreasonably
depreciate
your
business
qualities
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
,
"
said
Doyce
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
perhaps
not
.
 
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
I
have
a
calling
that
I
have
studied
more
than
such
matters
,
and
that
I
am
better
fitted
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
perfect
confidence
in
my
partner
,
and
I
am
satisfied
that
he
will
do
what
is
best
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
a
prejudice
connected
with
money
and
money
figures
,
"
continued
Doyce
,
laying
that
plastic
workman
's
thumb
of
his
on
the
lapel
of
his
partner
's
coat
,
"
it
is
against
speculating
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
have
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
entertain
that
prejudice
,
only
because
I
have
never
given
my
mind
fully
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
should
n't
call
it
a
prejudice
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Doyce
,
it
is
the
soundest
sense
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
think
so
,
"
returned
Doyce
,
with
his
grey
eye
looking
kind
and
bright
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
so
happens
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
that
just
now
,
not
half
an
hour
before
you
came
down
,
I
was
saying
the
same
thing
to
Pancks
,
who
looked
in
here
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
agreed
that
to
travel
out
of
safe
investments
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
,
as
it
is
one
of
the
most
common
,
of
those
follies
which
often
deserve
the
name
of
vices
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pancks
?
<EOS>
"
said
Doyce
,
tilting
up
his
hat
at
the
back
,
and
nodding
with
an
air
of
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
aye
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
cautious
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
very
cautious
fellow
indeed
,
"
returned
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
a
specimen
of
caution
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
both
appeared
to
derive
a
larger
amount
of
satisfaction
from
the
cautious
character
of
Mr
Pancks
,
than
was
quite
intelligible
,
judged
by
the
surface
of
their
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Daniel
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
"
as
time
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
,
my
trusty
partner
,
and
as
I
am
ready
for
starting
,
bag
and
baggage
,
at
the
gate
below
,
let
me
say
a
last
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
grant
a
request
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Any
request
you
can
make
---
Except
,
"
Clennam
was
quick
with
his
exception
,
for
his
partner
's
face
was
quick
in
suggesting
it
,
"
except
that
I
will
abandon
your
invention
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
request
,
and
you
know
it
is
,
"
said
Doyce
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
No
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
positively
,
No
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
I
have
begun
,
I
will
have
some
definite
reason
,
some
responsible
statement
,
something
in
the
nature
of
a
real
answer
,
from
those
people
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
,
"
returned
Doyce
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
my
word
for
it
,
you
never
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
I
'll
try
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
do
me
no
harm
to
try
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
certain
of
that
,
"
rejoined
Doyce
,
laying
his
hand
persuasively
on
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
done
me
harm
,
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
aged
me
,
tired
me
,
vexed
me
,
disappointed
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
does
no
man
any
good
to
have
his
patience
worn
out
,
and
to
think
himself
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
,
even
already
,
that
unavailing
attendance
on
delays
and
evasions
has
made
you
something
less
elastic
than
you
used
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Private
anxieties
may
have
done
that
for
the
moment
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
but
not
official
harrying
.
 
<EOS>
Not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
hurt
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
wo
n't
grant
my
request
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
,
No
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
ashamed
if
I
submitted
to
be
so
soon
driven
out
of
the
field
,
where
a
much
older
and
<EOS>
a
much
more
sensitively
interested
man
contended
with
fortitude
so
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
there
was
no
moving
him
,
Daniel
Doyce
returned
the
grasp
of
his
hand
,
and
,
casting
a
farewell
look
round
the
counting
-
house
,
went
down
-
stairs
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Doyce
was
to
go
to
Southampton
to
join
the
small
staff
of
his
fellow
-
travellers
;
and
a
coach
was
at
the
gate
,
well
furnished
and
packed
,
and
ready
to
take
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
workmen
were
at
the
gate
to
see
him
off
,
and
were
mightily
proud
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
luck
to
you
,
Mr
Doyce
!
<EOS>
"
said
one
of
the
number
.
<EOS>
"
Wherever
you
go
,
they
'll
find
as
they
've
got
a
man
among
'em
)
a
man
as
knows
his
tools
and
as
his
tools
knows
,
a
man
as
is
willing
and
a
man
as
is
able
,
and
if
that
's
not
a
man
,
where
is
a
man
!
"
<EOS>
This
oration
from
a
gruff
volunteer
in
the
back
-
ground
,
not
previously
suspected
of
any
powers
in
that
way
,
was
received
with
three
loud
cheers
;
and
the
speaker
became
a
distinguished
character
for
ever
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
three
loud
cheers
,
Daniel
gave
them
all
a
hearty
"
Good
Bye
,
Men
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
coach
disappeared
from
sight
,
as
if
the
concussion
of
the
air
had
blown
it
out
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
,
as
a
grateful
little
fellow
in
a
position
of
trust
,
was
among
the
workmen
,
and
had
done
as
much
towards
the
cheering
as
a
mere
foreigner
could
.
 
<EOS>
In
truth
,
no
men
on
earth
can
cheer
like
Englishmen
,
who
do
so
rally
one
another
's
blood
and
spirit
when
they
cheer
in
earnest
,
that
the
stir
is
like
the
rush
of
their
whole
history
,
with
all
its
standards
waving
at
once
,
from
Saxon
Alfred
's
downwards
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
had
been
in
a
manner
whirled
away
before
the
onset
,
and
was
taking
his
breath
in
quite
a
scared
condition
when
Clennam
beckoned
him
to
follow
up
-
stairs
,
and
return
the
books
and
papers
to
their
places
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
lull
consequent
on
the
departure

Arthur
stood
at
his
desk
,
looking
dreamily
out
at
a
gleam
of
sun
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
liberated
attention
soon
reverted
to
the
theme
that
was
foremost
in
his
thoughts
,
and
began
,
for
the
hundredth
time
,
to
dwell
upon
every
circumstance
that
had
impressed
itself
upon
his
mind
on
the
mysterious
night
when
he
had
seen
the
man
at
his
mother
's
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
man
jostled
him
in
the
crooked
street
,
again
he
followed
the
man
and
lost
him
,
again
he
came
upon
the
man
in
the
court
-
yard
looking
at
the
house
,
again
he
followed
the
man
and
stood
beside
him
on
the
door
-
steps
.

"
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
first
time
,
by
many
,
that
he
had
recalled
the
song
of
the
child
's
game
,
of
which
the
fellow
had
hummed
@
verse
while
they
stood
side
by
side
;
but
he
was
so
unconscious
of
having
repeated
it
audibly
,
that
he
started
to
hear
the
next
verse
.

Cavalletto
had
deferentially
suggested
the
words
and
tune
,
supposing
him
to
have
stopped
short
for
want
of
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
song

Cavalletto

"
   
<EOS>
"
By
Bacchus

yes
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
They
all
know
it
in

I
have
heard

many
times
,
sung
by
the
little
children

<EOS>
The
last
time
when
it
I
have
heard
,

said
Mr
Baptist
,
formerly
Cavalletto
,
who
usually
went
back
to
his
native
construction
of
sentences
when
his
memory
went
near
home
,
"
is
from
a
sweet
little
voice
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
voice
,
very
pretty
,
very
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
Altro
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
last
time
I
heard
it
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
"
was
in
a
voice
quite
the
reverse
of
pretty
,
and
quite
the
reverse
of
innocent
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
more
to
himself
than
to
his
companion
,
and
added
to
himself
,
repeating
the
man
's
next
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
Death
of
my
life
,
sir
,
it
's
my
character
to
be
impatient
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
EH
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Cavalletto
,
astounded
,
and
with
all
his
colour
gone
in
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
where
I
have
heard
that
song
the
last
time
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
his
rapid
native
action
,
his
hands
made
the
outline
of
a
high
hook
nose
,
pushed
his
eyes
near
together
,
dishevelled
his
hair
,
puffed
out
his
upper
lip
to
represent
a
thick
moustache
,
and
threw
the
heavy
end
of
an
ideal
cloak
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
While
doing
this
,
with
a
swiftness
incredible
to
one
who
has
not
watched
an
Italian
peasant
,
he
indicated
a
very
remarkable
and
sinister
smile
.
   
<EOS>
The
whole
change
passed
over
him
like
a
flash
of
light
,
and
he
stood
in
the
same
instant
,
pale
and
astonished
,
before
his
patron
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
Fate
and
wonder
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
a
man
of
the
name
of
Blandois
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Mr
Baptist
,
shaking
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
just
now
described
a
man
who
was
by
when
you
heard
that
song
;
have
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
said
Mr
Baptist
,
nodding
fifty
times
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
was
he
not
called
Blandois
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Mr
Baptist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Altro

Altro

Altro

Altro

<EOS>
He
could
not
reject
the
name
sufficiently
,
with
his
head
and
his
right
forefinger
going
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Clennam
,
spreading
out
the
handbill
on
his
desk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
this
the
man

can

But

at
it

too

<EOS>
Come
here
and
look
over
me

while
I
read

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
approached
,
followed
every
word
with
his
quick
eyes
,
saw
and
heard
it
all
out
with
the
greatest
impatience
,
then
clapped
his
two
hands
flat
upon
the
bill
as
if
he
had
fiercely
caught
some
noxious
creature
,
and
cried
,
looking
eagerly
at
Clennam
,
"
It
is
the
man
!
 
<EOS>
Behold
him
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
of
far
greater
moment
to
me
"
said
Clennam
,
in
great
agitation
,
"
than
you
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
where
you
knew
the
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
,
releasing
the
paper
very
slowly
and
with
much
discomfiture
,
and
drawing
himself
back
two
or
three
paces
,
and
making
as
though
he
dusted
his
hands
,
returned
,
very
much
against
his
will
:
   
<EOS>
"
At
Marsiglia
---
Marseilles
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
prisoner
,
and
---
Altro
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
yes
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
an
,
"
Mr
Baptist
crept
closer
again
to
whisper
it
,
"
Assassin
!
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
fell
back
as
if
the
word
had
struck
him
a
blow
:
so
terrible
did
it
make
his
mother
's
communication
with
the
man
appear
.
<EOS>
Cavalletto
dropped
on
one
knee
,
and
implored
him
,
with
a
redundancy
of
gesticulation
,
to
hear
what
had
brought
himself
into
such
foul
company
.
   
<EOS>
He
told
with
perfect
truth
how
it
had
come
of
a
little
contraband
trading
,
and
how
he
had
in
time
been
released
from
prison
,
and
how
he
had
gone
away
from
those
antecedents
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
at
the
house
of
entertainment
called
the
Break
of
Day
at
Chalons
on
the
Saone
,
he
had
been
awakened
in
his
bed
at
night
by
the
same
assassin
,
then
assuming
the
name
of
Lagnier
,
though
his
name
had
formerly
been
Rigaud
;
how
the
assassin
had
proposed
that
they
should
join
their
fortunes
together
;
how
he
held
the
assassin
in
such
dread
and
aversion
that
he
had
fled
from
him
at
daylight
,
and
how
he
had
ever
since
been
haunted
by
the
fear
of
seeing
the
assassin
again
and
being
claimed
by
him
as
an
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
related
this
,
with
an
emphasis
and
poise
on
the
word
,
"
assassin
,
"
peculiarly
belonging
to
his
own
language
,
and
which
did
not
serve
to
render
it
less
terrible
to
Clennam
<EOS>
,
he
suddenly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
pounced
upon
the
bill
again
,
and
with
a
vehemence
that
would
have
been
absolute
madness
in
any
man
of
Northern
origin
,
cried
"
Behold
the
same
assassin
!
 
<EOS>
Here
he
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
his
passionate
raptures
,
he
at
first
forgot
the
fact
that
he
had
lately
seen
the
assassin
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
remembering
it
,
it
suggested
hope
to
Clennam
that
the
recognition
might
be
of
later
date
than
the
night
of
the
visit
at
his
mother
's
;
but
Cavalletto
was
too
exact
and
clear
about
time
and
place
,
to
leave
any
opening
for
doubt
that
it
had
preceded
that
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
"
said
Arthur
,
very
seriously
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
man
,
as
we
have
read
here
,
has
wholly
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
it
I
am
well
content
!
"
<EOS>
said
Cavalletto
,
raising
his
eyes
piously
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
thanks
to
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
Accursed
assassin
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
"
returned
Clennam
;
"
for
until
something
more
is
heard
of
him
<EOS>
,
I
can
never
know
an
hour
's
peace
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
Benefactor
;
that
is
quite
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
A
million
of
excuses
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Cavalletto
,
"
said
Clennam
,
gently
turning
him
by
the
arm
,
so
that
they
looked
into
each
other
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
certain
that
for
the
little
I
have
been
able
to
do
for
you
,
you
are
the
most
sincerely
grateful
of
men
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
swear
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
could
find
this
man
,
or
discover
what
has
become
of
him
,
or
gain
any
later
intelligence
whatever
of
him
,
you
would
render
me
a
service
above
any
other
service
<EOS>
I
could
receive
in
the
world
,
and
would
make
me
(
with
far
greater
reason
)
as
grateful
to
you
as
you
are
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
where
to
look
,
"
cried
the
little
man
,
kissing
Arthur
's
hand
in
a
transport
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
where
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
where
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
courage
!
 
<EOS>
Enough
!
 
<EOS>
It
matters
not
!
 
<EOS>
I
go
,
in
this
instant
of
time
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
to
any
one
but
me
,
Cavalletto
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Al

<EOS>
cried
Cavalletto

And
was
gone
with
great
speed

Mistress
Affery
makes
a
Conditional
Promise
,
respecting
her
Dreams
 
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
with
the
expressive
looks
and
gestures
of
Mr
Baptist
<EOS>
,
otherwise
Giovanni
Baptista
Cavalletto
,
vividly
before
him
,
Clennam
entered
on
a
weary
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
he
tried
to
control
his
attention
by
directing
it
to
any
business
occupation
or
train
of
thought
;
it
rode
at
anchor
by
the
haunting
topic
,
and
would
hold
to
no
other
idea
.
 
<EOS>
As
though
a
criminal
should
be
chained
in
a
stationary
boat
on
a
deep
clear
river
,
condemned
,
<EOS>
whatever
countless
leagues
of
water
flowed
past
him
,
always
to
see
the
body
of
the
fellow
-
creature
he
had
drowned
lying
at
the
bottom
,
immovable
,
and
unchangeable
,
except
as
the
eddies
made
it
broad
or
long
,
now
expanding
,
now
contracting
its
terrible
lineaments
;
so
Arthur
,
below
the
shifting
current
of
transparent
thoughts
and
fancies
which
were
gone
and
succeeded
by
others
as
soon
as
come
,
saw
,
steady
and
dark
,
and
not
to
be
stirred
from
its
place
,
the
one
subject
that
he
endeavoured
with
all
his
might
to
rid
himself
of
,
and
that
he
could
not
fly
from
.
 
<EOS>
The
assurance
he
now
had
,
that
Blandois
,
whatever
his
right
name
,
was
one
of
the
worst
of
characters
,
greatly
augmented
the
burden
of
his
anxieties
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
disappearance
should
be
accounted
for
to
-
morrow
,
the
fact
that
his
mother
had
been
in
communication
with
such
a
man
,
would
remain
unalterable
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
communication
had
been
of
a
secret
kind
,
and
that
she
had
been
submissive
to
him
and
afraid
of
him
,
he
hoped
might
be
known
to
no
one
beyond
himself
;
yet
,
knowing
it
,
how
could
he
separate
it
from
his
old
vague
fears
,
and
how
believe
that
there
was
nothing
evil
in
such
relations
?
<EOS>
Her
resolution
not
to
enter
on
the
question
with
him
,
and
his
knowledge
of
her
indomitable
character
,
enhanced
his
sense
of
helplessness
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
the
oppression
of
a
dream
to
believe
that
shame
and
exposure
were
impending
over
her
and
his
father
's
memory
,
and
to
be
shut
out
,
as
by
a
brazen
wall
,
from
the
possibility
of
coming
to
their
aid
.
 
<EOS>
The
purpose
he
had
brought
home
to
his
native
country
,
and
had
ever
since
kept
in
view
,
was
,
with
her
greatest
determination
,
defeated
by
his
mother
herself
,
at
the
time
of
all
others
when
he
feared
that
it
pressed
most
.
 
<EOS>
His
advice
,
energy
,
activity
,
money
,
credit
,
all
his
resources
whatsoever
,
were
all
made
useless
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
possessed
of
the
old
fabled
influence
,
and
had
turned
those
who
looked
upon
her
into
stone
,
she
could
not
have
rendered
him
more
completely
powerless
<EOS>
(
so
it
seemed
to
him
in
his
distress
of
mind
)
than
she
did
,
when
she
turned
her
unyielding
face
to
his
in
her
gloomy
room
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
light
of
that
day
's
discovery
,
shining
on
these
considerations
,
roused
him
to
take
a
more
decided
course
of
action
.
   
<EOS>
Confident
in
the
rectitude
of
his
purpose
,
and
impelled
by
a
sense
of
overhanging
danger
closing
in
around
<EOS>
,
he
resolved
,
if
his
mother
would
still
admit
of
no
approach
,
to
make
a
desperate
appeal
to
Affery
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
could
be
brought
to
become
communicative
,
and
to
do
what
lay
in
her
to
break
the
spell
of
secrecy
that
enshrouded
the
house
,
he
might
shake
off
the
paralysis
of
which
every
hour
that
passed
over
his
head
made
him
more
acutely
sensible
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
result
of
his
day
's
anxiety
,
and
this
was
the
decision
he
put
in
practice
when
the
day
closed
in
.
   
<EOS>
His
first
disappointment
,
on
arriving
at
the
house
,
was
to
find
the
door
open
,
and
Mr
Flintwinch
smoking
a
pipe
on
the
steps
.
 
<EOS>
If
circumstances
had
been
commonly
favourable
,
Mistress
Affery
would
have
opened
the
door
to
his
knock
.
 
<EOS>
Circumstances
being
uncommonly
unfavourable
,
the
door
stood
open
,
and
Mr
Flintwinch
was
smoking
his
pipe
on
the
steps
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
evening

"
Good
evening
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
   
<EOS>
The
smoke
came
crookedly
out
of
Mr
Flintwinch
's
mouth
,
as
if
it
circulated
through
the
whole
of
his
wry
figure
and
came
back
by
his
wry
throat
,
before
coming
forth
to
mingle
with
the
smoke
from
the
crooked
chimneys
and
the
mists
from
the
crooked
river
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
news
?
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
news
,
"
said
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
of
the
foreign
man
,
"
Arthur
explained
.
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
mean
of
the
foreign
man
,
"
said
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
so
grim
,
as
he
stood
askew
,
with
the
knot
of
his
cravat
under
his
ear
,
that
the
thought
passed
into
Clennam
's
mind
,
and
not
for
the
first
time
by
many
,
could
Flintwinch
for
a
purpose
of
his
own
have
got
rid
of
Blandois
?
 
<EOS>
Could
it
have
been
his
secret
,
and
his
safety
,
that
were
at
issue
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
small
and
bent
,
and
perhaps
not
actively
strong
;
yet
he
was
as
tough
as
an
old
yew
-
tree
,
and
as
crusty
as
an
old
jackdaw
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
man
,
coming
behind
a
much
younger
and
more
vigorous
man
,
and
having
the
will
to
put
an
end
to
him
and
no
relenting
,
might
do
it
pretty
surely
in
that
solitary
place
at
a
late
hour
.
   
<EOS>
While
,
in
the
morbid
condition
of
his
thoughts
,
these
thoughts
drifted
over
the
main
one
that
was
always
in
Clennam
's
mind
,
Mr
Flintwinch
,
regarding
the
opposite
house
over
the
gateway
with
his
neck
twisted
and
one
eye
shut
up
,
stood
smoking
with
a
vicious
expression
upon
him
;
more
as
if
he
were
trying
to
bite
off
the
stem
of
his
pipe
,
than
as
if
he
were
enjoying
it
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
was
enjoying
it
in
his
own
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
able
to
take
my
likeness
,
the
next
time
you
call
,
Arthur
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
drily
,
as
he
stooped
to
knock
the
ashes
out
.
   
<EOS>
Rather
conscious
and
confused
,
Arthur
asked
his
pardon
,
if
he
had
stared
at
him
unpolitely
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
my
mind
runs
so
much
upon
this
matter
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
lose
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hah
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
do
n't
see
,
"
returned
Mr
Flintwinch
,
quite
at
his
leisure
,
"
why
it
should
trouble
YOU
,
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
very
shortly
and
decidedly
:
<EOS>
much
as
if
he
were
of
the
canine
race
,
and
snapped
at
Arthur
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
nothing
to
see
those
placards
about
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
nothing
to
me
to
see
my
mother
's
name
and
residence
hawked
up
and
down
in
such
an
association
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
,
"
returned
Mr
Flintwinch
,
scraping
his
horny
cheek
,
"
that
it
need
signify
much
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
do
see
,
Arthur
,
"
glancing
up
at
the
windows
;
"
I
see
the
light
of
fire
and
candle
in
your
mother
's
room
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
I
read
by
it
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
screwing
himself
at
him
,
"
that
if
it
's
advisable
(
as
the
proverb
says
it
is
)
to
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
,
it
's
just
as
advisable
,
perhaps
,
to
let
missing
dogs
lie
.
 
<EOS>
Let
'em
be
.
 
<EOS>
They
generally
turn
up
soon
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
turned
short
round
when
he
had
made
this
remark
,
and
went
into
the
dark
hall
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
stood
there
,
following
him
with
his
eyes
,
as
he
dipped
for
a
light
in
the
phosphorus
-
box
in
the
little
room
at
the
side
,
got
one
after
three
or
four
dips
,
and
lighted
the
dim
lamp
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
while
,
Clennam
was
pursuing
the
probabilities
---
rather
as
if
they
were
being
shown
to
him
by
an
invisible
hand
than
as
if
he
himself
were
conjuring
them
up
---
of
Mr
Flintwinch
's
ways
and
means
of
doing
that
darker
deed
,
and
removing
its
traces
by
any
of
the
black
avenues
of
shadow
that
lay
around
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
the
testy
Jeremiah
;
"
will
it
be
agreeable
to
walk
up
-
stairs
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
mother
is
alone
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
alone
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Casby
and
his
daughter
are
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
in
while
I
was
smoking
,
and
I
stayed
behind
to
have
my
smoke
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
second
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
made
no
remark
upon
it
,
and
repaired
to
his
mother
's
room
,
where
Mr
Casby
and
Flora
had
been
taking
tea
,
anchovy
paste
,
and
hot
buttered
toast
.
 
<EOS>
The
relics
of
those
delicacies
were
not
yet
removed
,
either
from
the
table
or
from
the
scorched
countenance
of
Affery
,
who
,
with
the
kitchen
toasting
-
fork
still
in
her
hand
,
looked
like
a
sort
of
allegorical
personage
;
except
that
she
had
a
considerable
advantage
over
the
general
run
of
such
personages
in
point
of
significant
emblematical
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
Flora
had
spread
her
bonnet
and
shawl
upon
the
bed
,
with
a
care
indicative
of
an
intention
to
stay
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Casby
,
too
,
was
beaming
near
the
hob
,
with
his
benevolent
knobs
shining
as
if
the
warm
butter
of
the
toast
were
exuding
through
the
patriarchal
skull
,
and
with
his
face
as
ruddy
as
if
the
colouring
matter
of
the
anchovy
paste
were
mantling
in
the
patriarchal
visage
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
this
,
as
he
exchanged
the
usual
salutations
,
Clennam
decided
to
speak
to
his
mother
without
postponement
.
   
<EOS>
It
had
long
been
customary
,
as
she
never
changed
her
room
,
for
those
who
had
anything
to
say
to
her
apart
,
to
wheel
her
to
her
desk
;
where
she
sat
,
usually
with
the
back
of
her
chair
turned
towards
the
rest
of
the
room
,
and
the
person
who
talked
with
her
seated
in
a
corner
,
on
a
stool
which
was
always
set
in
that
place
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Except
that
it
was
long
since
the
mother
and
son
had
spoken
together
without
the
intervention
of
a
third
person
,
it
was
an
ordinary
matter
of
course
within
the
experience
of
visitors
for
Mrs
Clennam
to
be
asked
,
with
a
word
of
apology
for
the
interruption
,
if
she
could
be
spoken
with
on
a
matter
of
business
,
and
,
on
her
replying
in
the
affirmative
,
to
be
wheeled
into
the
position
described
.
   
<EOS>
Therefore
,
when
Arthur
now
made
such
an
apology
,
and
such
a
request
,
and
moved
her
to
her
desk
and
seated
himself
on
the
stool
,
Mrs
Finching
merely
began
to
talk
louder
and
faster
,
as
a
delicate
hint
that
she
could
overhear
nothing
,
and
Mr
Casby
stroked
his
long
white
locks
with
sleepy
calmness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
I
have
heard
something
to
-
day
which
I
feel
persuaded
you
do
n't
know
,
and
which
I
think
you
should
know
,
of
the
antecedents
of
that
man
I
saw
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
antecedents
of
the
man
you
saw
here
,
Arthur
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
spoke
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
lowered
his
own
voice
;
but
she
rejected
that
advance
towards
confidence
as
she
rejected
every
other
,
and
spoke
in
her
usual
key
and
in
her
usual
stern
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
received
it
on
no
circuitous
information
;
it
has
come
to
me
direct
.
"
<EOS>
She
asked
him
,
exactly
as
before
,
if
he
were
there
to
tell
her
what
it
was
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
right
that
you
should
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
a
prisoner
in
a
French
gaol
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
answered
with
composure
,
"
I
should
think
that
very
likely
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
in
a
gaol
for
criminals
,
mother
.
 
<EOS>
On
an
accusation
of
murder
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
started
at
the
word
,
and
her
looks
expressed
her
natural
horror
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
she
still
spoke
aloud
,
when
she
demanded
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
Who
told
you
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
man
who
was
his
fellow
-
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
man
's
antecedents
,
I
suppose
,
were
not
known
to
you
,
before
he
told
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Though
the
man
himself
was
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
case
and
Flintwinch
's
,
in
respect
of
this
other
man
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
the
resemblance
is
not
so
exact
,
though
,
<EOS>
as
that
your
informant
became
known
to
you
through
a
letter
from
a
correspondent
with
whom
he
had
deposited
money
?
 
<EOS>
How
does
that
part
of
the
parallel
stand
?
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
had
no
choice
but
to
say
that
his
informant
had
not
become
known
to
him
through
the
agency
of
any
such
credentials
,
or
indeed
of
any
credentials
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
's
attentive
frown
expanded
by
degrees
into
a
severe
look
of
triumph
,
and
she
retorted
with
emphasis
,
"
Take
care
<EOS>
how
you
judge
others
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
to
you
,
Arthur
,
for
your
good
,
take
care
how
you
judge
!
"
<EOS>
Her
emphasis
had
been
derived
from
her
eyes
quite
as
much
as
from
the
stress
she
laid
upon
her
words
.
 
<EOS>
She
continued
to
look
at
him
;
and
if
,
when
he
entered
the
house
,
he
had
had
any
latent
hope
of
prevailing
in
the
least
with
her
,
she
now
looked
it
out
of
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
shall
I
do
nothing
to
assist
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
entrust
me
with
no
confidence
,
no
charge
,
no
explanation
?
   
<EOS>
Will
you
take
no
counsel
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
not
let
me
come
near
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
ask
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
separated
yourself
from
my
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
my
act
;
it
was
yours
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
consistently
ask
me
such
a
question
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
you
left
me
to
Flintwinch
,
and
that
he
occupies
your
place
.
"
   
<EOS>
Glancing
at
Jeremiah
,
Clennam
saw
in
his
very
gaiters
that
his
attention
was
closely
directed
to
them
,
though
he
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
scraping
his
jaw
,
and
pretended
to
listen
to
Flora
as
she
held
forth
in
a
most
distracting
manner
on
a
chaos
of
subjects
,
in
which
mackerel
,
and
Mr
F
's
Aunt
in
a
swing
,
had
become
entangled
with
cockchafers
and
the
wine
trade
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
prisoner
,
in
a
French
gaol
,
on
an
accusation
of
murder
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Clennam
,
steadily
going
over
what
her
son
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
you
know
of
him
from
the
fellow
-
prisoner
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
substance
,
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
was
the
fellow
-
prisoner
his
accomplice
and
a
murderer
,
too
?
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
he
gives
a
better
account
of
himself
than
of
his
friend
;
it
is
needless
to
ask
.
 
<EOS>
This
will
supply
the
rest
of
them
here
with
something
new
to
talk
about
.
 
<EOS>
Casby
,
Arthur
tells
me
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Stay
,
mother
!
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
stay
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
interrupted
her
hastily
,
for
it
had
not
entered
his
imagination
that
she
would
openly
proclaim
what
he
had
told
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
now
?
"
she
said
with
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
more
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
to
excuse
me
,
Mr
Casby
---
<EOS>
and
you
,
too
,
Mrs
Finching
---
for
one
other
moment
with
my
mother
---
"
   
He
had
laid
his
hand
upon
her
chair
,
or
she
would
otherwise
have
wheeled
it
round
with
the
touch
of
her
foot
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
still
face
to
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
,
as
he
ran
over
the
possibilities
of
some
result
he
had
not
intended
,
and
could
not
foresee
,
being
influenced
by
Cavalletto
's
disclosure
becoming
a
matter
of
notoriety
,
and
hurriedly
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
had
best
not
be
talked
about
;
though
perhaps
he
was
guided
by
no
more
distinct
reason
than
that
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
his
mother
would
reserve
it
to
herself
and
her
partner
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
now
?
"
she
said
again
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
,
mother
,
that
you
should
repeat
what
I
have
communicated
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
had
better
not
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
make
that
a
condition
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Observe
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
you
who
make
this
a
secret
,
"
said
she
,
holding
up
her
hand
,
"
and
not
I.
 
<EOS>
It
is
you
,
Arthur
,
who
bring
here
doubts
and
suspicions
and
entreaties
for
explanations
,
and
it
is
you
,
Arthur
,
who
bring
secrets
here
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
to
me
,
do
you
think
,
where
the
man
has
been
,
or
what
he
has
been
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
it
be
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
The
whole
world
may
know
it
,
if
they
care
to
know
it
;
it
is
nothing
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
yielded
to
her
imperious
but
elated
look
,
and
turned
her
chair
back
to
the
place
from
which
he
had
wheeled
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
doing
so
he
saw
elation
in
the
face
of
Mr
Flintwinch
,
which
most
assuredly
was
not
inspired
by
Flora
.
 
<EOS>
this
turning
of
his
intelligence
and
of
his
whole
attempt
and
design
against
himself
,
did
even
more
than
his
mother
's
fixedness
and
firmness
to
convince
him
that
his
efforts
with
her
were
idle
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
remained
but
the
appeal
to
his
old
friend
Affery
.
   
<EOS>
But
even
to
get
the
very
doubtful
and
preliminary
stage
of
making
the
appeal
,
seemed
one
of
the
least
promising
of
human
undertakings
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
completely
under
the
thrall
of
the
two
clever
ones
,
was
so
systematically
kept
in
sight
by
one
or
other
of
them
,
and
was
so
afraid
to
go
about
the
house
besides
,
that
every
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
alone
appeared
to
be
forestalled
.
<EOS>
Over
and
above
that
,
Mistress
Affery
,
by
some
means
(
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
guess
,
through
the
sharp
arguments
of
her
liege
lord
)
,
had
acquired
such
a
lively
conviction
of
the
hazard
of
saying
anything
under
any
circumstances
,
that
she
had
remained
all
this
time
in
a
corner
guarding
herself
from
approach
with
that
symbolical
instrument
of
hers
;
so
that
,
when
a
word
or
two
had
been
addressed
to
her
by
Flora
,
or
even
by
the
bottle
-
green
patriarch
himself
,
she
had
warded
off
conversation
with
the
toasting
-
fork
like
a
dumb
woman
.
   
<EOS>
After
several
abortive
attempts
to
get
Affery
to
look
at
him
while
she
cleared
the
table
and
washed
the
tea
-
service
,
Arthur
thought
of
an
expedient
which
Flora
might
originate
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
he
therefore
whispered
,
"
Could
you
say
you
would
like
to
go
through
the
house
?
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
poor
Flora
,
being
always
in
fluctuating
expectation
of
the
time
when
Clennam
would
renew
his
boyhood
and
be
madly
in
love
with
her
again
,
received
the
whisper
with
the
utmost
delight
;
not
only
as
rendered
precious
by
its
mysterious
character
,
but
as
preparing
the
way
for
a
tender
interview
in
which
he
would
declare
the
state
of
his
affections
.
 
<EOS>
She
immediately
began
to
work
out
the
hint
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
dear
me
the
poor
old
room
,
"
said
Flora
,
glancing
round
,
"
looks
just
as
ever
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
I
am
touched
to
see
except
for
being
smokier
which
was
to
be
expected
with
time
and
which
we
must
all
expect
and
reconcile
ourselves
to
being
whether
we
like
it
or
not
as
I
am
sure
I
have
had
to
do
myself
if
not
exactly
smokier
dreadfully
stouter
which
is
the
same
or
worse
,
to
think
of
the
days
when
papa
used
to
bring
me
here
the
least
of
girls
a
perfect
mass
of
chilblains
to
be
stuck
upon
a
chair
with
my
feet
on
the
rails
and
stare
at
Arthur
---
<EOS>
pray
excuse
me
---
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
---
the
least
of
boys
in
the
frightfullest
of
frills
and
jackets
ere
yet
<EOS>
Mr
F
appeared
a
misty
shadow
on
the
horizon
paying
attentions
like
the
well
-
known
spectre
of
some
place
in
Germany
beginning
with
a
B
is
a
moral
lesson
inculcating
that
all
the
paths
in
life
are
similar
to
the
paths
down
in
the
North
of
England
where
they
get
the
coals
and
make
the
iron
and
things
gravelled
with
ashes
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
paid
the
tribute
of
a
sigh
to
the
instability
of
human
existence
,
Flora
hurried
on
with
her
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
at
any
time
,
"
she
proceeded
,
"
its
worst
enemy
could
have
said
it
was
a
cheerful
house
for
that
it
was
never
made
to
be
<EOS>
but
always
highly
impressive
,
fond
memory
recalls
an
occasion
in
youth
ere
<EOS>
yet
the
judgment
was
mature
when
Arthur
---
confirmed
habit
---
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
---
took
me
down
into
an
unused
kitchen
eminent
for
mouldiness
and
proposed
to
secrete
me
there
for
life
and
feed
me
on
what
he
could
hide
from
his
meals
when
he
was
not
at
home
for
the
holidays
and
on
dry
bread
in
disgrace
which
at
that
halcyon
period
too
frequently
occurred
,
would
it
be
inconvenient
or
asking
too
much
to
beg
to
be
permitted
to
revive
those
scenes
and
walk
through
the
house
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
,
who
responded
with
a
constrained
grace
to
Mrs
Finching
's
good
nature
in
being
there
at
all
,
though
her
visit
(
before
Arthur
's
unexpected
arrival
)
was
undoubtedly
an
act
of
pure
good
nature
and
no
self
-
gratification
,
intimated
that
all
the
house
was
open
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
rose
and
looked
to
Arthur
for
his
escort
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
"
said
he
,
aloud
;
"
and
Affery
will
light
us
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Affery
was
excusing
herself
with
"
Do
n't
ask
nothing
of
me
,
Arthur
!
"
when
Mr
Flintwinch
stopped
her
with
"
Why
not
?
 
<EOS>
Affery
,
what
's
the
matter
with
you
,
woman
?
 
<EOS>
Why
not
,
jade
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
expostulated
with
,
she
came
unwillingly
out
of
her
corner
,
resigned
the
toasting
-
fork
into
one
of
her
husband
's
hands
,
and
took
the
candlestick
he
offered
from
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
before
,
you
fool
!
"
said
Jeremiah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
up
,
or
down
,
Mrs
Finching
?
"
   
<EOS>
Flora
answered
,
"
Down
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
go
before
,
and
down
,
you
Affery
,
"
said
Jeremiah
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
do
it
properly
,
or
I
'll
come
rolling
down
the
banisters
,
and
tumbling
over
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Affery
headed
the
exploring
party
;
Jeremiah
closed
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
intention
of
leaving
them
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
looking
back
,
and
seeing
him
following
three
stairs
behind
,
in
the
coolest
and
most
methodical
manner
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
<EOS>
,
"
Is
there
no
getting
rid
of
him
!
"
<EOS>
Flora
reassured
his
mind
by
replying
promptly
,
"
Why
though
not
exactly
proper
Arthur
and
a
thing
I
could
n't
think
of
before
a
younger
man
or
a
stranger
<EOS>
still
I
do
n't
mind
him
if
you
so
particularly
wish
it
and
provided
you
'll
have
the
goodness
not
to
take
me
too
tight
.
"
   
<EOS>
Wanting
the
heart
to
explain
that
this
was
not
at
all
what
he
meant
,
Arthur
extended
his
supporting
arm
round
Flora
's
figure
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
goodness
me
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
obedient
indeed
really
<EOS>
and
it
's
extremely
honourable
and
gentlemanly
<EOS>
in
you
I
am
sure
but
still
at
the
same
time
if
you
would
like
to
be
a
little
tighter
than
that
I
should
n't
consider
it
intruding
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
this
preposterous
attitude
,
unspeakably
at
variance
with
his
anxious
mind
,
Clennam
descended
to
the
basement
of
the
house
;
finding
that
wherever
it
became
darker
than
elsewhere
,
Flora
became
heavier
,
and
that
when
the
house
was
lightest
she
was
too
.
<EOS>
Returning
from
the
dismal
kitchen
regions
,
which
were
as
dreary
as
they
could
be
,
Mistress
Affery
passed
with
the
light
into
his
father
's
old
room
,
and
then
into
the
old
dining
-
room
;
always
passing
on
before
like
a
phantom
that
was
not
to
be
overtaken
,
and
neither
turning
nor
answering
when
he
whispered
,
"
Affery
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
dining
-
room
,
a
sentimental
desire
came
over
Flora
to
look
into
the
dragon
closet
which
had
so
often
swallowed
Arthur
in
the
days
of
his
boyhood
---
not
improbably
because
,
as
a
very
dark
closet
,
it
was
a
likely
place
to
be
heavy
in
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
,
fast
subsiding
into
despair
,
had
opened
it
,
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
outer
door
.
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
,
with
a
suppressed
cry
,
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
 
<EOS>
You
want
another
dose
!
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
,
my
woman
,
you
shall
have
a
good
one
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
shall
have
a
sneezer
,
you
shall
have
a
teaser
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
is
anybody
going
to
the
door
?
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
,
I
am
going
to
the
door
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
old
man
so
savagely
,
as
to
render
it
clear
that
in
a
choice
of
difficulties
he
felt
he
must
go
,
though
he
would
have
preferred
not
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
here
the
while
,
all
!
 
<EOS>
Affery
,
my
woman
,
move
an
inch
,
or
speak
a
word
in
your
foolishness
,
and
I
'll
treble
your
dose
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
moment
he
was
gone
,
Arthur
released
Mrs
Finching
:
with
some
difficulty
,
by
reason
of
that
lady
misunderstanding
his
intentions
,
and
making
arrangements
with
a
view
to
tightening
instead
of
slackening
.
   
<EOS>
"
Affery
,
speak
to
me
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
touch
me
,
Arthur
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
shrinking
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
come
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Jeremiah
will
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
see
me
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
,
"
if
I
blow
the
candle
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
hear
you
,
"
cried
Affery
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
hear
me
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
suiting
the
action
to
the
words
again
,
"
if
I
draw
you
into
this
black
closet
,
and
speak
here
.
   
<EOS>
Why
do
you
hide
your
face
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
afraid
of
seeing
something
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
afraid
of
seeing
anything
in
this
darkness
,
Affery
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
Much
more
than
if
it
was
light
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
afraid
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
the
house
is
full
of
mysteries
and
secrets
;
because
it
's
full
of
whisperings
and
counsellings
;
because
it
's
full
of
noises
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
house
for
noises
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
die
of
'em
,
if
Jeremiah
do
n't
strangle
me
first
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
expect
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
heard
any
noises
here
,
worth
speaking
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
would
,
though
,
if
you
lived
in
the
house
,
and
was
obliged
to
go
about
it
as
I
am

"
said
Affery
;
"
<EOS>
and
you
'd
feel
that
they
was
so
well
worth
speaking
of

that
you
'd
feel
you
was
nigh
bursting
through
not
being
allowed
to
speak
of
'em

<EOS>
Here

<EOS>
You
'll
get
me
killed

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
Affery
<EOS>

I
solemnly
declare
to
you
that
I
can
see
the
light
of
the
open
door
on
the
pavement
of
the
hall

uncover
your

look

<EOS>
"
I
durstn't
do
it

said
Affery
,
"
<EOS>
I
durstn't
never

Arthur

<EOS>
I
'm

folded

when
Jeremiah
an't
a

He

"
You

miles
away

<EOS>
(
"
I
wish
he
was
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Affery
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Affery
,
I
want
to
know
what
is
amiss
here

I
want
some
light
thrown
on
the
secrets

this
house

<EOS>
"
I
tell
you

Arthur

she
interrupted

noises

the

rustlings

His

,
being
in
fact
so
near
at
hand
that
she
was
then
reclining
against
him
in
a
flutter
,
a
very
substantial
angle
of
forty
-
five
degrees
,
here
interposed
to
assure
Mistress
Affery
with
greater
earnestness
than
directness
of
asseveration
<EOS>
,
that
what
she
heard
should
go
no
further
,
but
should
be
kept
inviolate
,

if
on
no
other
account
on
Arthur

sensible
of
intruding
in
being
too
familiar
Doyce
and
Clennam

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
make
an
imploring
appeal
to
you
,
Affery
,
to
you
,
one
of
the
few
agreeable
early
remembrances
I
have

for

for

for

<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
can
tell
me
something
connected

the
coming
here
of
this
man

if
you
will

<EOS>
"
Why

then
I
'll
tell
you

Arthur

returned
Affery

"
Jeremiah

coming

"
   
<EOS>
"
No

indeed
he

not

<EOS>
The
door
is
open

and
he
is
standing
outside
,
talking
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
then
,
"
said
Affery
,
after
listening
,
"
that
the
first
time
he
ever
come
he
heard
the
noises
his
own
self

<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
,
"
I
says
to
him
,
catching
hold
of
him

"
but
I
have
heard
it
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
While
I
says
it
,
he
stands
a
looking
at
me
,
all
of
a
shake
,
he
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
he
been
here
often
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
that
night
,
and
the
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
see
of
him
on
the
last
night
,
after
I
was
gone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Them
two
clever
ones
had
him
all
alone
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Jeremiah
come
a
dancing
at
me
sideways
,
after
I
had
let
you
out
<EOS>
(
he
always
comes
a
dancing
at
me
<EOS>
sideways
when
he
's
going
to
hurt
me
)
,
<EOS>
and
he
said
to
me
,
"
Now
,
Affery
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
a
coming
behind
you
,
my
woman
,
and
a
going
to
run
you
up
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
he
took
and
squeezed
the
back
of
my
neck
in
his
hand
,
till
it
made
me
open
MY
mouth
,
and
then
he
pushed
me
before
him
to
bed
,
squeezing
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
he
calls
running
me
up
,
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
's
a
wicked
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
did
you
hear
or
see
no
more
,
Affery
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
tell
you
I
was
sent
to
bed
,
Arthur
!
 
<EOS>
Here
he
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
he
is
still
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Those
whisperings
and
counsellings
,
Affery
,
that
you
have
spoken
of
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
nothing
about
'em
,
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
Get
away
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
my
dear
Affery
;
unless
I
can
gain
some
insight
into
these
hidden
things
,
in
spite
of
your
husband
and
in
spite
of
my
mother
,
ruin
will
come
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
nothing
,
"
repeated
Affery
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
in
a
dream
for
ever
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
Go
away
,
go
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
said
that
before
,
"
returned
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
used
the
same
expression
that
night
,
at
the
door
,
when
I
asked
you
what
was
going
on
here
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
being
in
a
dream
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
an't
a
going
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Get
away
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
tell
you
,
if
you
was
by
yourself
;
much
less
with
your
old
sweetheart
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
equally
vain
for
Arthur
to
entreat
,
and
for
Flora
to
protest
.
 
<EOS>
Affery
,
who
had
been
trembling
and
struggling
the
whole
time
,
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
adjuration
,
and
was
bent
on
forcing
herself
out
of
the
closet
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
sooner
scream
to
Jeremiah
than
say
another
word
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
call
out
to
him
,
Arthur
,
if
you
do
n't
give
over
speaking
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Now
here
's
the
very
last
word
I
'll
say
afore
<EOS>
I
call
to
him
---
<EOS>
If
ever
you
begin
to
get
the
better
of
them
two
clever
ones
<EOS>
your
own
self
<EOS>
(
you
ought
to
it
,
as
I
told
you
when
you
first
come
home
,
for
you
have
n't
been
a
living
here
long
years
,
to
be
made
afeared
of
your
life
as
I
have
)
,
then
do
you
get
the
better
of
'em
afore
my
face
;
and
then
do
you
say
to
me
,
Affery
tell
your
dreams
!
 
<EOS>
Maybe
,
then
I
'll
tell
'
em
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
shutting
of
the
door
stopped
Arthur
from
replying
.
 
<EOS>
They
glided
into
the
places
where
Jeremiah
had
left
them
;
and
Clennam
,
stepping
forward
as
that
old
gentleman
returned
,
informed
him
that
he
had
accidentally
extinguished
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
looked
on
as
he
re
-
lighted
it
at
the
lamp
in
the
hall
,
and
preserved
a
profound
taciturnity
respecting
the
person
who
had
been
holding
him
in
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
his
irascibility
demanded
compensation
for
some
tediousness
that
the
visitor
had
expended
on
him
;
however
that
was
,
he
took
such
umbrage
at
seeing
his
wife
with
her
apron
over
her
head
,
that
he
charged
at
her
,
and
taking
her
veiled
nose
between
his
thumb
and
finger
,
appeared
to
throw
the
whole
screw
-
power
of
his
person
into
the
wring
he
gave
it
.
   
<EOS>
Flora
,
now
permanently
heavy
,
did
not
release
Arthur
from
the
survey
of
the
house
,
until
it
had
extended
even
to
his
old
garret
bedchamber
.
 
<EOS>
His
thoughts
were
otherwise
occupied
than
with
the
tour
of
inspection
;
yet
he
took
particular
notice
at
the
time
,
as
he
afterwards
had
occasion
to
remember
,
of
the
airlessness
and
closeness
of
the
house
;
that
they
left
the
track
of
their
footsteps
in
the
dust
on
the
upper
floors
;
and
that
there
was
a
resistance
to
the
opening
of
one
room
door
,
which
occasioned
Affery
to
cry
out
that
somebody
was
hiding
inside
,
and
to
continue
to
believe
so
,
though
somebody
was
sought
and
not
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
at
last
returned
to
his
mother
's
room
,
they
found
her
shading
her
face
with
her
muffled
hand
,
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
the
Patriarch
as
he
stood
before
the
fire
,
whose
blue
eyes
,
polished
head
,
and
silken
locks
,
turning
towards
them
as
they
came
in
,
imparted
an
inestimable
value
and
inexhaustible
love
of
his
species
to
his
remark
:
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
been
seeing
the
premises
,
seeing
the
premises
---
premises
---
seeing
the
premises
!
"
   
<EOS>
it
was
not
in
itself
a
jewel
of
benevolence
or
wisdom
,
yet
he
made
it
an
exemplar
of
both
that
one
would
have
liked
to
have
a
copy
of
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
24
.
<EOS>
The
Evening
of
a
Long
Day
 
<EOS>
That
illustrious
man
and
great
national
ornament
,
Mr
Merdle
,
continued
his
shining
course
.
 
<EOS>
It
began
to
be
widely
understood
that
one
who
had
done
society
the
admirable
service
of
making
so
much
money
out
of
it
,
could
not
be
suffered
to
remain
a
commoner
.
<EOS>
A
baronetcy
was
spoken
of
with
confidence
;
a
peerage
was
frequently
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
Rumour
had
it
that
Mr
Merdle
had
set
his
golden
face
against
a
baronetcy
;
that
he
had
plainly
intimated
to
Lord
Decimus
that
a
baronetcy
was
not
enough
for
him
;
that
he
had
said
,
"
No
---
a
Peerage
,
or
plain
Merdle
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
reported
to
have
plunged
Lord
Decimus
as
nigh
to
his
noble
chin
in
a
slough
of
doubts
as
so
lofty
a
person
could
be
sunk
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
Barnacles
,
as
a
group
of
themselves
in
creation
,
had
an
idea
that
such
distinctions
belonged
to
them
;
and
that
when
a
soldier
,
sailor
,
or
lawyer
became
ennobled
,
they
let
him
in
,
as
it
were
,
by
an
act
of
condescension
,
at
the
family
door
,
and
immediately
shut
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
Not
only
(
said
Rumour
)
had
the
troubled
Decimus
his
own
hereditary
part
in
this
impression
,
but
he
also
knew
of
several
Barnacle
claims
already
on
the
file
,
which
came
into
collision
with
that
of
the
master
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
Right
or
wrong
,
Rumour
was
very
busy
;
and
Lord
Decimus
,
while
he
was
,
or
was
supposed
to
be
,
in
stately
excogitation
of
the
difficulty
,
lent
her
some
countenance
by
taking
,
on
several
public
occasions
,
one
of
those
elephantine
trots
of
his
through
a
jungle
of
overgrown
sentences
,
waving
Mr
Merdle
about
on
his
trunk
as
Gigantic
Enterprise
,
The
Wealth
of
England
,
Elasticity
,
Credit
,
Capital
,
Prosperity
,
and
all
manner
of
blessings
.
   
<EOS>
So
quietly
did
the
mowing
of
the
old
scythe
go
on
,
that
fully
three
months
had
passed
unnoticed
since
the
two
English
brothers
had
been
laid
in
one
tomb
in
the
strangers
'
cemetery
at
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Sparkler
were
established
in
their
own
house
:
a
little
manSion
,
rather
of
the
Tite
Barnacle
class
,
quite
a
triumph
of
inconvenience
,
with
a
perpetual
smell
in
it
of
the
day
before
yesterday
's
soup
and
coach
-
horses
,
but
extremely
dear
,
as
being
exactly
in
the
centre
of
the
habitable
globe
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
enviable
abode
(
and
envied
it
really
was
by
many
people
)
,
Mrs
Sparkler
had
intended
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
demolition
of
the
Bosom
,
when
active
hostilities
had
been
suspended
by
the
arrival
of
the
Courier
with
his
tidings
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparkler
,
who
was
not
unfeeling
,
had
received
them
with
a
violent
burst
of
grief
,
which
had
lasted
twelve
hours
;
after
which
,
she
had
arisen
to
see
about
her
mourning
,
and
to
take
every
precaution
that
could
ensure
its
being
as
becoming
as
Mrs
Merdle
's
.
 
<EOS>
A
gloom
was
then
cast
over
more
than
one
distinguished
family
(
according
to
the
politest
sources
of
intelligence
)
,
and
the
Courier
went
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Sparkler
had
been
dining
alone
,
with
their
gloom
cast
over
them
,
and
Mrs
Sparkler
reclined
on
a
drawing
-
room
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
hot
summer
Sunday
evening
.
 
<EOS>
The
residence
in
the
centre
of
the
habitable
globe
,
at
all
times
stuffed
and
close
as
if
it
had
an
incurable
cold
in
its
head
<EOS>
,
was
that
evening
particularly
stifling
.
   
<EOS>
The
bells
of
the
churches
had
done
their
worst
in
the
way
of
clanging
among
the
unmelodious
echoes
of
the
streets
,
and
the
lighted
windows
of
the
churches
had
ceased
to
be
yellow
in
the
grey
dusk
,
and
had
died
out
opaque
black
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparkler
,
lying
on
her
sofa
,
looking
through
an
open
window
at
the
opposite
side
of
a
narrow
street
over
boxes
of
mignonette
and
flowers
,
was
tired
of
the
view
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparkler
,
looking
at
another
window
where
her
husband
stood
in
the
balcony
,
was
tired
of
that
view
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparkler
,
looking
at
herself
in
her
mourning
,
was
even
tired
of
that
view
:
though
,
naturally
,
not
so
tired
of
that
as
of
the
other
two
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
lying
in
a
well
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparkler
,
changing
her
position
fretfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Edmund
<EOS>
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
,
why
do
n't
you
say
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
might
have
replied
with
ingenuousness
,
"
My
life
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
repartee
did
not
occur
to
him
,
he
contented
himself
with
coming
in
from
the
balcony
and
standing
at
the
side
of
his
wife
's
couch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Edmund
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Sparkler
more
fretfully
still
,
you
are
absolutely
putting
mignonette
up
your
nose
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
,
in
absence
of
mind
---
perhaps
in
a
more
literal
absence
of
mind
than
is
usually
understood
by
the
phrase
---
had
smelt
so
hard
at
a
sprig
in
his
hand
as
to
be
on
the
verge
of
the
offence
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
said
,
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
my
dear
,
"
and
threw
it
out
of
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
make
my
head
ache
by
remaining
in
that
position
,
Edmund
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparkler
,
raising
her
eyes
to
him
after
another
minute
;
"
you
look
so
aggravatingly
large
by
this
light
.
 
<EOS>
Do
sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
,
and
took
a
chair
on
the
same
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
did
n't
know
that
the
longest
day
was
past
,
"
said
Fanny
,
yawning
in
a
dreary
manner
<EOS>
,
"
I
should
have
felt
certain
this
was
the
longest
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
did
experience
such
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
fan
,
my
love
?
"
asked
Mr
Sparkler
,
picking
up
one
and
presenting
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Edmund
,
"
returned
his
wife
,
more
wearily
yet
,
"
do
n't
ask
weak
questions
,
I
entreat
you
not
.
 
<EOS>
Whose
can
it
be
but
mine
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
thought
it
was
yours
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
should
n't
ask
,
"
retorted
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
while
she
turned
on
her
sofa
and
exclaimed
,
"
Dear
me
,
dear
me
,
there
never
was
such
a
long
day
as
this
!
"
 
<EOS>
After
another
little
while
,
she
got
up
slowly
,
walked
about
,
and
came
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
<EOS>
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
,
flashing
with
an
original
conception
,
"
I
think
you
must
have
got
the
fidgets
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Fidgets
!
"
repeated
Mrs
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
adorable
girl
,
"
urged
Mr
Sparkler
,
"
try
your
aromatic
vinegar
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
seen
my
mother
try
it
,
and
it
seemingly
refreshed
her
.
   
<EOS>
And
she
is
,
as
I
believe
you
are
aware
,
a
remarkably
fine
woman
,
with
no
non
---
"
   
"
Good
Gracious
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Fanny
,
starting
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
beyond
all
patience
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
most
wearisome
day
that
ever
did
dawn
upon
the
world
,
I
am
certain
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
looked
meekly
after
her
as
she
lounged
about
the
room
,
and
he
appeared
to
be
a
little
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
tossed
a
few
trifles
about
,
and
had
looked
down
into
the
darkening
street
out
of
all
the
three
windows
,
she
returned
to
her
sofa
,
and
threw
herself
among
its
pillows
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
Edmund
,
come
here
!
 
<EOS>
Come
a
little
nearer
,
because
I
want
to
be
able
to
touch
you
with
my
fan
,
that
I
may
impress
you
very
much
with
what
I
am
going
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
That
will
do
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
close
enough
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
do
look
so
big
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
apologised
for
the
circumstance
,
pleaded
that
he
could
n't
help
it
,
and
said
that
"
our
fellows
,
"
without
more
particularly
indicating
whose
fellows
,
used
to
call
him
by
the
name
of
Quinbus
Flestrin
,
Junior
,
or
the
Young
Man
Mountain
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
have
told
me
so
before
,
"
Fanny
complained
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
returned
Mr
Sparkler
,
rather
gratified
,
"
I
did
n't
know
It
would
interest
you
,
or
I
would
have
made
a
point
of
telling
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
For
goodness
sake
,
do
n't
talk
,
"
said
Fanny
;
"
I
want
to
talk
,
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Edmund
,
we
must
not
be
alone
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
take
such
precautions
as
will
prevent
my
being
ever
again
reduced
to
the
state
of
dreadful
depression
in
which
I
am
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
answered
Mr
Sparkler
;
"
being
as
you
are
well
known
to
be
,
a
remarkably
fine
woman
with
no
---
"
   
"
Oh
,
good
GRACIOUS
!
"
cried
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
was
so
discomposed
by
the
energy
of
this
exclamation
,
accompanied
with
a
flouncing
up
from
the
sofa
and
a
flouncing
down
again
,
that
a
minute
or
two
elapsed
before
he
felt
himself
equal
to
saying
in
explanation
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
my
dear
,
that
everybody
knows
you
are
calculated
to
shine
in
society
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Calculated
to
shine
in
society
,
"
retorted
Fanny
with
great
irritability
;
"
yes
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
And
then
what
happens
?
 
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
recover
,
in
a
visiting
point
of
view
,
the
shock
of
poor
dear
papa
's
death
,
and
my
poor
uncle
's
---
though
I
do
not
disguise
from
myself
that
the
last
was
a
happy
release
,
for
,
if
you
are
not
presentable
you
had
much
better
die
---
"
   
"
You
are
not
referring
to
me
,
my
love
,
I
hope
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
humbly
interrupted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Edmund
,
Edmund
,
you
would
wear
out
a
Saint
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
not
expressly
speaking
of
my
poor
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
looked
with
so
much
expression
at
myself
,
my
dear
girl
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
,
"
that
I
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
have
put
me
out
,
"
observed
Fanny
with
a
resigned
toss
of
her
fan
,
"
and
I
had
better
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
do
that
,
my
love
,
"
urged
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fanny
took
a
good
deal
of
time
:
lying
back
with
her
eyes
shut
,
and
her
eyebrows
raised
with
a
hopeless
expression
as
if
she
had
utterly
given
up
all
terrestrial
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
without
the
slightest
notice
,
she
opened
her
eyes
again
,
and
recommenced
in
a
short
,
sharp
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
happens
then
,
I
ask
!
 
<EOS>
What
happens
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
find
myself
at
the
very
period
when
I
might
shine
most
in
society
,
and
should
most
like
for
very
momentous
reasons
to
shine
in
society
---
I
find
myself
in
a
situation
which
to
a
certain
extent
disqualifies
me
for
going
into
society
.
 
<EOS>
it
's
too
bad
,
really
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
need
keep
you
at
home
.
"
<EOS>
"
Edmund
,
you
ridiculous
creature
,
"
returned
Fanny
,
with
great
indignation
;
"
do
you
suppose
that
a
woman
in
the
bloom
of
youth
and
not
wholly
devoid
of
personal
attractions
,
can
put
herself
,
at
such
a
time
,
in
competition
as
to
figure
with
a
woman
in
every
other
way
her
inferior
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
suppose
such
a
thing
,
your
folly
is
boundless
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
submitted
that
he
had
thought
"
it
might
be
got
over
.
"
<EOS>
"
Got
over
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Fanny
,
with
immeasurable
scorn
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
a
time
,
"
Mr
Sparkler
submitted
.
   
<EOS>
Honouring
the
last
feeble
suggestion
with
no
notice
,
Mrs
Sparkler
declared
with
bitterness
that
it
really
was
too
bad
,
and
that
positively
it
was
enough
to
make
one
wish
one
was
dead
!
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
had
in
some
measure
recovered
from
her
sense
of
personal
ill
-
usage
;
"
provoking
as
it
is
,
and
cruel
as
it
seems
,
I
suppose
it
must
be
submitted
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Especially
as
it
was
to
be
expected
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
   
<EOS>
"
Edmund
,
"
returned
his
wife
,
"
if
you
have
nothing
more
becoming
to
do
than
to
attempt
to
insult
the
woman
who
has
honoured
you
with
her
hand
,
when
she
finds
herself
in
adversity
,
I
think
YOU
had
better
go
to
bed
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
was
much
afflicted
by
the
charge
,
and
offered
a
most
tender
and
earnest
apology
.
 
<EOS>
His
apology
was
accepted
;
but
Mrs
Sparkler
requested
him
to
go
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
sofa
and
sit
in
the
window
-
curtain
,
to
tone
himself
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Edmund
,
"
she
said
,
stretching
out
her
fan
,
and
touching
him
with
it
at
arm
's
length
,
"
what
I
was
going
to
say
to
you
when
you
began
as
usual
to
prose
and
worry
,
is
,
that
I
shall
guard
against
our
being
alone
any
more
,
and
that
when
circumstances
prevent
my
going
out
to
my
own
satisfaction
,
I
must
arrange
to
have
some
people
or
other
always
here
;
for
I
really
can
not
,
and
will
not
,
have
another
such
day
as
this
has
been
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
's
sentiments
as
to
the
plan
were
,
in
brief
,
that
it
had
no
nonsense
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
added
,
"
<EOS>
And
besides
,
you
know
it
's
likely
that
you
'll
soon
have
your
sister
---
"
   
"
Dearest
Amy
,
yes
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mrs
Sparkler
with
a
sigh
of
affection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Darling
little
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Not
,
however
,
that
Amy
would
do
here
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
was
going
to
say
"
No
?
"
<EOS>
interrogatively
,
but
he
saw
his
danger
and
said
it
assentingly
,
"
No
,
<EOS>
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
;
she
would
n't
do
here
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Edmund
.
 
<EOS>
For
not
only
are
the
virtues
of
the
precious
child
of
that
still
character
that
they
require
a
contrast
---
require
life
and
movement
around
them
to
bring
them
out
in
their
right
colours
and
make
one
love
them
of
all
things
;
but
she
will
require
to
be
roused
,
on
more
accounts
than
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
Roused
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
,
Edmund
!
 
<EOS>
Your
habit
of
interrupting
without
having
the
least
thing
in
the
world
to
say
,
distracts
one
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
be
broken
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Speaking
of
Amy
;
---
my
poor
little
pet
was
devotedly
attached
to
poor
papa
,
and
no
doubt
will
have
lamented
his
loss
exceedingly
,
and
grieved
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
so
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
felt
it
dreadfully
.
 
<EOS>
But
Amy
will
no
doubt
have
felt
it
even
more
,
from
having
been
on
the
spot
the
whole
time
,
and
having
been
with
poor
dear
papa
at
the
last
;
which
I
unhappily
was
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Fanny
stopped
to
weep
,
and
to
say
,
"
Dear
,
dear
,
beloved
papa
!
<EOS>
How
truly
gentlemanly
he
was
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
contrast
to
poor
uncle
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
From
the
effects
of
that
trying
time
,
"
she
pursued
,
"
my
good
little
Mouse
will
have
to
be
roused
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
from
the
effects
of
this
long
attendance
upon
Edward
in
his
illness
;
an
attendance
which
is
not
yet
over
,
which
may
even
go
on
for
some
time
longer
,
and
which
in
the
meanwhile
unsettles
us
all
by
keeping
poor
dear
papa
's
affairs
from
being
wound
up
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
however
,
the
papers
with
his
agents
here
being
all
sealed
up
and
locked
up
,
as
he
left
them
when
he
providentially
came
to
England
,
the
affairs
are
in
that
state
of
order
that
they
can
wait
until
my
brother
Edward
recovers
his
health
in
Sicily
,
sufficiently
to
come
over
,
and
administer
,
or
execute
,
or
whatever
it
may
be
that
will
have
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
could
n't
have
a
better
nurse
to
bring
him
round
,
"
Mr
Sparkler
made
bold
to
opine
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
a
wonder
,
I
can
agree
with
you
,
"
returned
his
wife
,
languidly
turning
her
eyelids
a
little
in
his
direction
<EOS>
(
she
held
forth
,
in
general
,
as
if
to
the
drawing
-
room
furniture
)
,
"
and
can
adopt
your
words
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
have
a
better
nurse
to
bring
him
round
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
times
when
my
dear
child
is
a
little
wearing
to
an
active
mind
;
but
,
as
a
nurse
,
she
is
Perfection
.
 
<EOS>
Best
of
Amys
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
,
growing
rash
on
his
late
success
,
observed
that
Edward
had
had
,
biggodd
,
a
long
bout
of
it
,
my
dear
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
Bout
,
Edmund
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparkler
,
"
is
the
slang
term
for
indisposition
,
he
has
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
is
not
,
I
am
unable
to
give
an
opinion
on
the
barbarous
language
you
address
to
Edward
's
sister
.
<EOS>
That
he
contracted
Malaria
Fever
somewhere
,
either
by
travelling
day
and
night
to
Rome
,
where
,
after
all
,
he
arrived
too
late
to
see
poor
dear
papa
before
his
death
---
or
under
some
other
unwholesome
circumstances
---
is
indubitable
,
if
that
is
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Likewise
that
his
extremely
careless
life
has
made
him
a
very
bad
subject
for
it
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
considered
it
a
parallel
case
to
that
of
some
of
our
fellows
in
the
West
Indies
with
Yellow
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparkler
closed
her
eyes
again
,
and
refused
to
have
any
consciousness
of
our
fellows
of
the
West
Indies
,
or
of
Yellow
Jack
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
Amy
,
"
she
pursued
,
when
she
reopened
her
eyelids
,
"
will
require
to
be
roused
from
the
effects
of
many
tedious
and
anxious
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
And
lastly
,
she
will
require
to
be
roused
from
a
low
tendency
which
I
know
very
well
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
what
it
is
,
Edmund
,
because
I
must
decline
to
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
thus
have
much
improvement
to
effect
in
my
sweet
child
,
"
Mrs
Sparkler
continued
,
"
and
can
not
have
her
near
me
too
soon
.
<EOS>
Amiable
and
dear
little
Twoshoes
!
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
settlement
of
poor
papa
's
affairs
,
my
interest
in
that
is
not
very
selfish
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
behaved
very
generously
to
me
when
I
was
married
,
and
I
have
little
or
nothing
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Provided
he
had
made
no
will
that
can
come
into
force
,
leaving
a
legacy
to
Mrs
General
<EOS>
,
I
am
contented
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
papa
,
dear
papa
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
wept
again
,
but
Mrs
General
was
the
best
of
restoratives
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
soon
stimulated
her
to
dry
her
eyes
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
It
is
a
highly
encouraging
circumstance
in
Edward
's
illness
,
I
am
thankful
to
think
,
and
gives
one
the
greatest
confidence
in
his
sense
not
being
impaired
,
or
his
proper
spirit
weakened
---
down
to
the
time
of
poor
dear
papa
's
death
at
all
events
---
that
he
paid
off
Mrs
General
instantly
,
and
sent
her
out
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
applaud
him
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
forgive
him
a
great
deal
for
doing
,
with
such
promptitude
,
so
exactly
what
I
would
have
done
myself
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparkler
was
in
the
full
glow
of
her
gratification
,
when
a
double
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
odd
knock
.
 
<EOS>
Low
,
as
if
to
avoid
making
a
noise
and
attracting
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Long
,
as
if
the
person
knocking
were
preoccupied
in
mind
,
and
forgot
to
leave
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
this
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
Not
Amy
and
Edward
without
notice
and
without
a
carriage
!
"
said
Mrs
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
room
was
dark
,
but
the
street
was
lighter
,
because
of
its
lamps
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
's
head
peeping
over
the
balcony
looked
so
very
bulky
and
heavy
<EOS>
that
it
seemed
on
the
point
of
overbalancing
him
and
flattening
the
unknown
below
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
one
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
see
who
---
stop
though
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
this
second
thought
he
went
out
into
the
balcony
again
and
had
another
look
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
back
as
the
door
was
opened
,
and
announced
that
he
believed
he
had
identified
"
his
governor
's
tile
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
mistaken
,
for
his
governor
,
with
his
tile
in
his
hand
,
was
introduced
immediately
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
Candles
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Sparkler
,
with
a
word
of
excuse
for
the
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
light
enough
for
me
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
candles
were
brought
in
,
Mr
Merdle
was
discovered
standing
behind
the
door
,
picking
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
'd
give
you
a
call
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
rather
particularly
occupied
just
now
;
and
,
as
I
happened
to
be
out
for
a
stroll
,
I
thought
I
'd
give
you
a
call
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
was
in
dinner
dress
,
Fanny
asked
him
where
he
had
been
dining
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
I
have
n't
been
dining
anywhere
,
particularly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
have
dined
?
"
said
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
---
no
,
I
have
n't
exactly
dined
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
passed
his
hand
over
his
yellow
forehead
and
considered
,
as
if
he
were
not
sure
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Something
to
eat
was
proposed
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
I
do
n't
feel
inclined
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
have
dined
out
along
with
Mrs
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
I
did
n't
feel
inclined
for
dinner
,
I
let
Mrs
Merdle
go
by
herself
just
as
we
were
getting
into
the
carriage
,
and
thought
I
'd
take
a
stroll
instead
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Would
he
have
tea
or
coffee
?
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
looked
in
at
the
Club
,
and
got
a
bottle
of
wine
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
period
of
his
visit
,
Mr
Merdle
took
the
chair.which
Edmund
Sparkler
had
offered
him
,
and
which
he
had
hitherto
been
pushing
slowly
about
before
him
,
like
a
dull
man
with
a
pair
of
skates
on
for
the
first
time
,
who
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
start
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
put
his
hat
upon
another
chair
beside
him
,
and
,
looking
down
into
it
as
if
it
were
some
twenty
feet
deep
,
said
again
:
"
<EOS>
You
see
I
thought
I
'd
give
you
a
call
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Flattering
to
us
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
for
you
are
not
a
calling
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
---
no
,
"
returned
Mr
Merdle
,
who
was
by
this
time
taking
himself
into
custody
under
both
coat
-
sleeves
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
a
calling
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
too
much
to
do
for
that
,
"
said
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Having
so
much
to
do
,
Mr
Merdle
,
loss
of
appetite
is
a
serious
thing
with
you
,
and
you
must
have
it
seen
to
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
be
ill
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
well
,
"
replied
Mr
Merdle
,
after
deliberating
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
well
as
I
usually
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
well
as
I
want
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
master
-
mind
of
the
age
,
true
to
its
characteristic
of
being
at
all
times
a
mind
that
had
as
little
as
possible
to
say
for
itself
and
great
difficulty
in
saying
it
,
became
mute
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparkler
began
to
wonder
how
long
the
master
-
mind
meant
to
stay
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
speaking
of
poor
papa
when
you
came
in
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
 
<EOS>
Quite
a
coincidence
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
Fanny
did
not
see
that
;
but
felt
it
incumbent
on
her
to
continue
talking
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
saying
,
"
she
pursued
,
"
that
my
brother
's
illness
has
occasioned
a
delay
in
examining
and
arranging
papa
's
property
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
;
"
yes
.
 
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
delay
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
it
is
of
consequence
,
"
said
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
,
"
assented
Mr
Merdle
,
after
having
examined
the
cornice
of
all
that
part
of
the
room
which
was
within
his
range
:
"
not
that
it
is
of
any
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
only
anxiety
is
,
"
said
Fanny
,
"
that
Mrs
General
should
not
get
anything
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
wo
n't
get
anything
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
Fanny
was
delighted
to
hear
him
express
the
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
,
after
taking
another
gaze
into
the
depths
of
his
hat
as
if
he
thought
he
saw
something
at
the
bottom
,
rubbed
his
hair
and
slowly
appended
to
his
last
remark
the
confirmatory
words
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Not
she
.
 
<EOS>
Not
likely
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
topic
seemed
exhausted
,
and
Mr
Merdle
too
,
Fanny
inquired
if
he
were
going
to
take
up
Mrs
Merdle
and
the
carriage
in
his
way
home
?
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
answered
;
"
I
shall
go
by
the
shortest
way
,
and
leave
Mrs
Merdle
to
---
"
here
he
looked
all
over
the
palms
of
both
his
hands
as
if
he
were
telling
his
own
fortune
---
"
to
take
care
of
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
'll
manage
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Probably
,
"
said
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
then
a
long
silence
;
during
which
,
Mrs
Sparkler
,
lying
back
on
her
sofa
again
,
shut
her
eyes
and
raised
her
eyebrows
in
her
former
retirement
from
mundane
affairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
however
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
,
"
I
am
equally
detaining
you
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
'd
give
you
a
call
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Charmed
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Fanny
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
am
off
,
"
added
Mr
Merdle
,
getting
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Could
you
lend
me
a
penknife
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
an
odd
thing
<EOS>
,
Fanny
smilingly
observed
,
for
her
who
could
seldom
prevail
upon
herself
even
to
write
a
letter
,
to
lend
to
a
man
of
such
vast
business
as
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
acquiesced
;
"
but
I
want
one
;
and
I
know
you
have
got
several
little
wedding
keepsakes
about
,
with
scissors
and
tweezers
and
such
things
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
have
it
back
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Edmund
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparkler
,
"
open
(
now
,
very
carefully
,
<EOS>
I
beg
and
beseech
,
for
you
are
so
very
awkward
)
<EOS>
the
mother
of
pearl
box
on
my
little
table
there
,
and
give
Mr
Merdle
the
mother
of
pearl
penknife
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
;
"
but
if
you
have
got
one
with
a
darker
handle
,
I
think
I
should
prefer
one
with
a
darker
handle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tortoise
-
shell
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
;
"
yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
prefer
tortoise
-
shell
.
"
   
<EOS>
Edmund
accordingly
received
instructions
to
open
the
tortoise
-
shell
box
,
and
give
Mr
Merdle
the
tortoise
-
shell
knife
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
doing
so
,
his
wife
said
to
the
master
-
spirit
graciously
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
forgive
you
,
if
you
ink
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
undertake
not
to
ink
it
,
"
said
Mr
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
The
illustrious
visitor
then
put
out
his
coat
-
cuff
,
and
for
a
moment
entombed
Mrs
Sparkler
's
hand
:
wrist
,
bracelet
,
and
all
.
<EOS>
Where
his
own
hand
had
shrunk
to
,
was
not
made
manifest
,
but
it
was
as
remote
from
Mrs
Sparkler
's
sense
of
touch
as
if
he
had
been
a
highly
meritorious
Chelsea
Veteran
or
Greenwich
Pensioner
.
   
<EOS>
Thoroughly
convinced
,
as
he
went
out
of
the
room
,
that
it
was
the
longest
day
that
ever
did
come
to
an
end
at
last
,
and
that
there
never
was
a
woman
,
not
wholly
devoid
of
personal
attractions
,
so
worn
out
by
idiotic
and
lumpish
people
,
Fanny
passed
into
the
balcony
for
a
breath
of
air
.
 
<EOS>
Waters
of
vexation
filled
her
eyes
;
and
they
had
the
effect
of
making
the
famous
Mr
Merdle
,
in
going
down
the
street
,
appear
to
leap
,
and
waltz
,
and
gyrate
,
as
if
he
were
possessed
of
several
Devils
.

<EOS>
The
dinner
-
party
was
at
the
great
Physician
's
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
was
there
,
and
in
full
force
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
Barnacle
was
there
,
and
in
his
most
engaging
state
.
 
<EOS>
Few
ways
of
life
were
hidden
from
Physician
,
and
he
was
oftener
in
its
darkest
places
than
even
Bishop
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
brilliant
ladies
about
London
who
perfectly
doted
on
him
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
as
the
most
charming
creature
and
the
most
delightful
person
,
who
would
have
been
shocked
to
find
themselves
so
close
to
him
if
they
could
have
known
on
what
sights
<EOS>
those
thoughtful
eyes
of
his
had
rested
within
an
hour
or
two
,
and
near
to
whose
beds
,
and
under
what
roofs
,
his
composed
figure
had
stood
.
 
<EOS>
But
Physician
was
a
composed
man
,
who
performed
neither
on
his
own
trumpet
,
nor
on
the
trumpets
of
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
Many
wonderful
things
did
he
see
and
hear
,
and
<EOS>
much
irreconcilable
moral
contradiction
<EOS>
did
he
pass
his
life
among
;
yet
his
equality
of
compassion
was
no
more
disturbed
than
the
Divine
Master
's
of
all
healing
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
,
like
the
rain
,
among
the
just
and
unjust
,
doing
all
the
good
he
could
,
and
neither
proclaiming
it
in
the
synagogues
nor
at
the
corner
of
streets
.
   
<EOS>
As
no
man
of
large
experience
of
humanity
,
however
quietly
carried
it
may
be
,
can
fail
to
be
invested
with
an
interest
peculiar
to
the
possession
of
such
knowledge
,
Physician
was
an
attractive
man
.
<EOS>
Even
the
daintier
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
had
no
idea
of
his
secret
,
and
who
would
have
been
startled
out
of
more
wits
than
they
had
,
by
the
monstrous
impropriety
of
his
proposing
to
them
<EOS>
"
Come
and
see
what
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
confessed
his
attraction
.
 
<EOS>
Where
he
was
,
something
real
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
half
a
grain
of
reality
,
like
the
smallest
portion
of
some
other
scarce
natural
productions
,
will
flavour
an
enormous
quantity
of
diluent
.
   
<EOS>
It
came
to
pass
,
therefore
,
that
Physician
's
little
dinners
always
presented
people
in
their
least
conventional
lights
.
 
<EOS>
The
guests
said
to
themselves
,
whether
they
were
conscious
of
it
or
no
,
"
Here
is
a
man
who
really
has
an
acquaintance
with
us
as
we
are
,
who
is
admitted
to
some
of
us
every
day
with
our
wigs
and
paint
off
,
who
hears
the
wanderings
of
our
minds
,
and
sees
the
undisguised
expression
of
our
faces
,
when
both
are
past
our
control
;
we
may
as
well
make
an
approach
to
reality
with
him
,
for
the
man
has
got
the
better
of
us
and
is
too
strong
for
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
Physician
's
guests
came
out
so
surprisingly
at
his
round
table
that
they
were
almost
natural
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
's
knowledge
of
that
agglomeration
of
jurymen
which
is
called
humanity
was
as
sharp
as
a
razor
;
yet
a
razor
is
not
a
generally
convenient
instrument
,
and
Physician
's
plain
bright
scalpel
,
though
far
less
keen
,
was
adaptable
to
far
wider
purposes
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
knew
all
about
the
gullibility
and
knavery
of
people
;
but
Physician
could
have
given
him
a
better
insight
into
their
tendernesses
and
affections
,
in
one
week
of
his
rounds
,
than
Westminster
Hall
and
all
the
circuits
put
together
,
in
threescore
years
and
ten
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
always
had
a
suspicion
of
this
,
and
perhaps
was
glad
to
encourage
it
(
for
,
if
the
world
were
really
a
great
Law
Court
,
one
would
think
that
the
last
day
of
Term
could
not
too
soon
arrive
)
;
and
so
he
liked
and
respected
Physician
quite
as
much
as
any
other
kind
of
man
did
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
's
default
left
a
Banquo
's
chair
at
the
table
;
but
,
if
he
had
been
there
,
he
would
have
merely
made
the
difference
of
Banquo
in
it
,
and
consequently
he
was
no
loss
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
,
who
picked
up
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
about
Westminster
Hall
,
much
as
a
raven
would
have
done
if
he
had
passed
as
much
of
his
time
there
,
had
been
picking
up
a
great
many
straws
lately
and
tossing
them
about
,
to
try
which
way
the
Merdle
wind
blew
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
had
a
little
talk
on
the
subject
with
Mrs
Merdle
herself
;
sidling
up
to
that
lady
,
of
course
,
with
his
double
eye
-
glass
and
his
jury
droop
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
certain
bird
,
"
said
Bar
;
and
he
looked
as
if
it
could
have
been
no
other
bird
than
a
magpie
;
"
has
been
whispering
among
us
lawyers
lately
,
that
there
is
to
be
an
addition
to
the
titled
personages
of
this
realm
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
?
"
said
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
not
the
bird
been
whispering
in
very
different
ears
from
ours
---
in
lovely
ears
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
looked
expressively
at
Mrs
Merdle
's
nearest
ear
-
ring
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
mine
?
"
asked
Mrs
Merdle
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
say
lovely
,
"
said
Bar
,
"
I
always
mean
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
never
mean
anything
,
I
think
,
"
returned
Mrs
Merdle
(
not
displeased
)
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
cruelly
unjust
!
"
said
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
the
bird
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
hear
news
,
"
observed
Mrs
Merdle
,
carelessly
arranging
her
stronghold
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
admirable
witness
you
would
make
!
"
said
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
jury
(
unless
we
could
empanel
one
of
blind
men
)
could
resist
you
,
if
you
were
ever
so
bad
a
one
;
but
you
would
be
such
a
good
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
ridiculous
man
?
"
asked
Mrs
Merdle
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
waved
his
double
eye
-
glass
three
or
four
times
between
himself
and
the
Bosom
,
as
a
rallying
answer
,
and
inquired
in
his
most
insinuating
accents
:
   
"
What
am
I
to
call
the
most
elegant
,
accomplished
and
charming
of
women
,
a
few
weeks
,
or
it
may
be
a
few
days
,
hence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
your
bird
tell
you
what
to
call
her
?
"
answered
Mrs
Merdle
.
<EOS>
"
Do
ask
it
to
-
morrow
,
and
tell
me
the
next
time
you
see
me
what
it
says
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
led
to
further
passages
of
similar
pleasantry
between
the
two
;
but
Bar
,
with
all
his
sharpness
,
got
nothing
out
of
them
.
<EOS>
Physician
,
on
the
other
hand
,
taking
Mrs
Merdle
down
to
her
carriage
and
attending
on
her
as
she
put
on
her
cloak
,
inquired
into
the
symptoms
with
his
usual
calm
directness
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
this
true
about
Merdle
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
My
dear
doctor
,
"
she
returned
,
"
you
ask
me
the
very
question
that
I
was
half
disposed
to
ask
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
To
ask
me
!
 
<EOS>
Why
me
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
honour
,
I
think
Mr
Merdle
reposes
greater
confidence
in
you
than
in
any
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
he
tells
me
absolutely
nothing
,
even
professionally
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
heard
the
talk
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
what
Mr
Merdle
is
;
you
know
how
taciturn
and
reserved
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
have
no
idea
what
foundation
for
it
there
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
it
to
be
true
;
why
should
I
deny
that
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
know
better
,
if
I
did
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
said
Physician
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
whether
it
is
all
true
,
or
partly
true
,
or
entirely
false
,
I
am
wholly
unable
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
most
provoking
situation
,
a
most
absurd
situation
;
but
you
know
Mr
Merdle
,
and
are
not
surprised
.
"
   
<EOS>
Physician
was
not
surprised
,
handed
her
into
her
carriage
,
and
bade
her
Good
Night
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
for
a
moment
at
his
own
hall
door
,
looking
sedately
at
the
elegant
equipage
as
it
rattled
away
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
return
up
-
stairs
,
the
rest
of
the
guests
soon
dispersed
,
and
he
was
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Being
a
great
reader
of
all
kinds
of
literature
(
and
never
at
all
apologetic
for
that
weakness
)
,
he
sat
down
comfortably
to
read
.
   
<EOS>
The
clock
upon
his
study
table
pointed
to
a
few
minutes
short
of
twelve
,
when
his
attention
was
called
to
it
by
a
ringing
at
the
door
bell
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
of
plain
habits
,
he
had
sent
his
servants
to
bed
and
must
needs
go
down
to
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
down
,
and
there
found
a
man
without
hat
or
coat
,
whose
shirt
sleeves
were
rolled
up
tight
to
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
moment
,
he
thought
the
man
had
been
fighting
:
the
rather
,
as
he
was
much
agitated
and
out
of
breath
.
<EOS>
A
second
look
,
however
,
showed
him
that
the
man
was
particularly
clean
,
and
not
otherwise
discomposed
as
to
his
dress
than
as
it
answered
this
description
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
the
warm
-
baths
,
sir
,
round
in
the
neighbouring
street
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
the
matter
at
the
warm
-
baths
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
please
to
come
directly
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
found
that
,
lying
on
the
table
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
into
the
physician
's
hand
a
scrap
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
Physician
looked
at
it
,
and
read
his
own
name
and
address
written
in
pencil
;
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
closer
at
the
writing
,
looked
at
the
man
,
took
his
hat
from
its
peg
,
put
the
key
of
his
door
in
his
pocket
,
and
they
hurried
away
together
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
the
warm
-
baths
,
all
the
other
people
belonging
to
that
establishment
were
looking
out
for
them
at
the
door
,
and
running
up
and
down
the
passages
.
 
<EOS>
"
Request
everybody
else
to
keep
back
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
the
physician
aloud
to
the
master
;
"
and
do
you
take
me
straight
to
the
place
,
my
friend
,
"
to
the
messenger
.
   
<EOS>
The
messenger
hurried
before
him
,
along
a
grove
of
little
rooms
,
and
turning
into
one
at
the
end
of
the
grove
,
looked
round
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Physician
was
close
upon
him
,
and
looked
round
the
door
too
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
bath
in
that
corner
,
from
which
the
water
had
been
hastily
drained
off
.
 
<EOS>
Lying
in
it
,
as
in
a
grave
or
sarcophagus
,
with
a
hurried
drapery
of
sheet
and
blanket
thrown
across
it
,
was
the
body
of
a
heavily
-
made
man
,
with
an
obtuse
head
,
and
coarse
,
mean
,
common
features
.
 
<EOS>
A
sky
-
light
had
been
opened
to
release
the
steam
with
which
the
room
had
been
filled
;
but
it
hung
,
condensed
into
water
-
drops
,
heavily
upon
the
walls
,
and
heavily
upon
the
face
and
figure
in
the
bath
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
still
hot
,
and
the
marble
of
the
bath
still
warm
;
but
the
face
and
figure
were
clammy
to
the
touch
.
 
<EOS>
The
white
marble
at
the
bottom
of
the
bath
was
veined
with
a
dreadful
red
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
ledge
at
the
side
,
were
an
empty
laudanum
-
bottle
and
a
tortoise
-
shell
handled
penknife
---
soiled
,
but
not
with
ink
.
   
<EOS>
"
Separation
of
jugular
vein
---
death
rapid
---
been
dead
at
least
half
an
hour
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
echo
of
the
physician
's
words
ran
through
the
passages
and
little
rooms
,
and
through
the
house
while
he
was
yet
straightening
himself
from
having
bent
down
to
reach
to
the
bottom
of
the
bath
,
and
while
he
was
yet
dabbling
his
hands
in
water
;
redly
veining
it
as
the
marble
was
veined
,
before
it
mingled
into
one
tint
.
   
<EOS>
He
turned
his
eyes
to
the
dress
upon
the
sofa
,
and
to
the
watch
,
money
,
and
pocket
-
book
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
A
folded
note
half
buckled
up
in
the
pocket
-
book
,
and
half
protruding
from
it
,
caught
his
observant
glance
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
it
,
touched
it
,
pulled
it
a
little
further
out
from
among
the
leaves
,
said
quietly
,
"
This
is
addressed
to
me
,
"
and
opened
and
read
it
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
no
directions
for
him
to
give
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
of
the
house
knew
what
to
do
;
the
proper
authorities
were
soon
brought
;
and
they
took
an
equable
business
-
like
possession
of
the
deceased
,
and
of
what
had
been
his
property
,
with
no
greater
disturbance
of
manner
or
countenance
than
usually
attends
the
winding
-
up
of
a
clock
.
<EOS>
Physician
was
glad
to
walk
out
into
the
night
air
---
was
even
glad
,
in
spite
of
his
great
experience
,
to
sit
down
upon
a
door
-
step
for
a
little
while
:
feeling
sick
and
faint
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
was
a
near
neighbour
of
his
,
and
,
when
he
came
to
the
house
,
he
saw
a
light
in
the
room
where
he
knew
his
friend
often
sat
late
getting
up
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
light
was
never
there
when
Bar
was
not
,
it
gave
him
assurance
that
Bar
was
not
yet
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
this
busy
bee
had
a
verdict
to
get
to
-
morrow
,
against
evidence
,
and
was
improving
the
shining
hours
in
setting
snares
for
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
.
   
<EOS>
Physician
's
knock
astonished
Bar
;
but
,
as
he
immediately
suspected
that
somebody
had
come
to
tell
him
that
somebody
else
was
robbing
him
,
or
otherwise
trying
to
get
the
better
of
him
,
he
came
down
promptly
and
softly
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
clearing
his
head
with
a
lotion
of
cold
water
,
as
a
good
preparative
to
providing
hot
water
for
the
heads
of
the
jury
,
and
had
been
reading
with
the
neck
of
his
shirt
thrown
wide
open
that
he
might
the
more
freely
choke
the
opposite
witnesses
.
 
<EOS>
In
consequence
,
he
came
down
,
looking
rather
wild
.
<EOS>
Seeing
Physician
,
the
least
expected
of
men
,
he
looked
wilder
and
said
,
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
asked
me
once
what
Merdle
's
complaint
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Extraordinary
answer
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
had
not
found
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
it
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
"
said
Bar
,
starting
back
,
and
clapping
his
hand
upon
the
other
's
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
have
I
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
went
into
the
nearest
room
,
where
Physician
gave
him
the
letter
to
read
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
it
through
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
much
in
it
as
to
quantity
;
but
it
made
a
great
demand
on
his
close
and
continuous
attention
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
sufficiently
give
utterance
to
his
regret
that
he
had
not
himself
found
a
clue
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
The
smallest
clue
,
he
said
,
would
have
made
him
master
of
the
case
,
and
what
a
case
it
would
have
been
to
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
!
   
<EOS>
Physician
had
engaged
to
break
the
intelligence
in
Harley
Street
.
<EOS>
Bar
could
not
at
once
return
to
his
inveiglements
of
the
most
enlightened
and
remarkable
jury
he
had
ever
seen
in
that
box
,
with
whom
,
he
could
tell
his
learned
friend
,
no
shallow
sophistry
would
go
down
,
and
no
unhappily
abused
professional
tact
and
skill
prevail
(
this
was
the
way
he
meant
to
begin
with
them
)
;
so
he
said
he
would
go
too
,
and
would
loiter
to
and
fro
near
the
house
while
his
friend
was
inside
.
 
<EOS>
They
walked
there
,
the
better
to
recover
self
-
possession
in
the
air
;
and
the
wings
of
day
were
fluttering
the
night
when
Physician
knocked
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
A
footman
of
rainbow
hues
,
in
the
public
eye
,
was
sitting
up
for
his
master
---
<EOS>
that
is
to
say
,
was
fast
asleep
in
the
kitchen
over
a
couple
of
candles
and
a
newspaper
,
demonstrating
the
great
accumulation
of
mathematical
odds
against
the
probabilities
of
a
house
being
set
on
fire
by
accident
When
this
serving
man
was
roused
,
Physician
had
still
to
await
the
rousing
of
the
Chief
Butler
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
that
noble
creature
came
into
the
dining
-
room
in
a
flannel
gown
and
list
shoes
;
but
with
his
cravat
on
,
and
a
Chief
Butler
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
morning
now
.
 
<EOS>
Physician
had
opened
the
shutters
of
one
window
while
waiting
,
that
he
might
see
the
light
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
's
maid
must
be
called
,
and
told
to
get
Mrs
Merdle
up
,
and
prepare
her
as
gently
as
she
can
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
dreadful
news
to
break
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
Physician
to
the
Chief
Butler
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
,
who
had
a
candle
in
his
hand
,
called
his
man
to
take
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
approached
the
window
with
dignity
;
looking
on
at
Physician
's
news
exactly
as
he
had
looked
on
at
the
dinners
in
that
very
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
is
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
wish
,
"
said
the
Chief
Butler
,
"
to
give
a
month
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Merdle
has
destroyed
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
the
Chief
Butler
,
"
that
is
very
unpleasant
to
the
feelings
of
one
in
my
position
,
as
calculated
to
awaken
prejudice
;
and
I
should
wish
to
leave
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
not
shocked
,
are
you
not
surprised
,
man
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
Physician
,
warmly
.
   
<EOS>
The
Chief
Butler
,
erect
and
calm
,
replied
in
these
memorable
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
Mr
Merdle
never
was
the
gentleman
,
and
no
ungentlemanly
act
on
Mr
Merdle
's
part
would
surprise
me
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
anybody
else
I
can
send
to
you
,
or
any
other
directions
I
can
give
before
I
leave
,
respecting
what
you
would
wish
to
be
done
?
"
   
<EOS>
When
Physician
,
after
discharging
himself
of
his
trust
up
-
stairs
,
rejoined
Bar
in
the
street
,
he
said
no
more
of
his
interview
with
Mrs
Merdle
than
that
he
had
not
yet
told
her
all
,
but
that
what
he
had
told
her
she
had
borne
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
had
devoted
his
leisure
in
the
street
to
the
construction
of
a
most
ingenious
man
-
trap
for
catching
the
whole
of
his
jury
at
a
blow
;
having
got
that
matter
settled
in
his
mind
,
it
was
lucid
on
the
late
catastrophe
,
and
they
walked
home
slowly
,
discussing
it
in
every
bearing
.
<EOS>
Before
parting
at
the
Physician
's
door
,
they
both
looked
up
at
the
sunny
morning
sky
,
into
which
the
smoke
of
a
few
early
fires
and
the
breath
and
voices
of
a
few
early
stirrers
were
peacefully
rising
,
and
then
looked
round
upon
the
immense
city
,
and
said
,
if
all
those
hundreds
and
thousands
of
beggared
people
who
were
yet
asleep
could
only
know
,
as
they
two
spoke
,
the
ruin
that
impended
over
them
,
what
a
fearful
cry
against
one
miserable
soul
would
go
up
to
Heaven
!
   
<EOS>
The
report
that
the
great
man
was
dead
,
got
about
with
astonishing
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
was
dead
of
all
the
diseases
that
ever
were
known
,
and
of
several
bran
-
new
maladies
invented
with
the
speed
of
Light
to
meet
the
demand
of
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
concealed
a
dropsy
from
infancy
,
he
had
inherited
a
large
estate
of
water
on
the
chest
from
his
grandfather
,
he
had
had
an
operation
performed
upon
him
every
morning
of
his
life
for
eighteen
years
,
he
had
been
subject
to
the
explosion
of
important
veins
in
his
body
after
the
manner
of
fireworks
,
he
had
had
something
the
matter
with
his
lungs
,
he
had
had
something
the
matter
with
his
heart
,
he
had
had
something
the
matter
with
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
Five
hundred
people
who
sat
down
to
breakfast
entirely
uninformed
on
the
whole
subject
,
believed
before
they
had
done
breakfast
,
that
they
privately
and
personally
knew
Physician
to
have
said
to
Mr
Merdle
,
"
You
must
expect
to
go
out
,
some
day
,
like
the
snuff
of
a
candle
;
"
and
that
they
knew
Mr
Merdle
to
have
said
to
Physician
,
"
A
man
can
die
but
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
about
eleven
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
,
something
the
matter
with
the
brain
,
became
the
favourite
theory
against
the
field
;
and
by
twelve
the
something
had
been
distinctly
ascertained
to
be
"
Pressure
.
"
   
<EOS>
Pressure
was
so
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
public
mind
,
and
seemed
to
make
everybody
so
comfortable
,
that
it
might
have
lasted
all
day
but
for
Bar
's
having
taken
the
real
state
of
the
case
into
Court
at
half
-
past
nine
.
 
<EOS>
This
led
to
its
beginning
to
be
currently
whispered
all
over
London
by
about
one
,
that
Mr
Merdle
had
killed
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Pressure
,
however
,
so
far
from
being
overthrown
by
the
discovery
,
became
a
greater
favourite
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
general
moralising
upon
Pressure
,
in
every
street
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
people
who
had
tried
to
make
money
and
had
not
been
able
to
do
it
,
said
,
There
you
were
!
 
<EOS>
You
no
sooner
began
to
devote
yourself
to
the
pursuit
of
wealth
than
you
got
Pressure
.
 
<EOS>
The
idle
people
improved
the
occasion
in
a
similar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
See
,
said
they
,
what
you
brought
yourself
to
by
work
,
work
,
work
!
 
<EOS>
You
persisted
in
working
,
you
overdid
it
.
 
<EOS>
Pressure
came
on
,
and
you
were
done
for
!
 
<EOS>
This
consideration
was
very
potent
in
many
quarters
,
but
nowhere
more
so
than
among
the
young
clerks
and
partners
who
had
never
been
in
the
slightest
danger
of
overdoing
it
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
one
and
all
,
declared
,
quite
piously
,
that
they
hoped
they
would
never
forget
the
warning
as
long
as
they
lived
,
and
that
their
conduct
might
be
so
regulated
as
to
keep
off
Pressure
,
and
preserve
them
,
a
comfort
to
their
friends
,
for
many
years
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
at
about
the
time
of
High
"
Change
,
Pressure
began
to
wane
,
and
appalling
whispers
to
circulate
,
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
south
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
they
were
faint
,
and
went
no
further
than
a
doubt
whether
Mr
Merdle
's
wealth
would
be
found
to
be
as
vast
as
had
been
supposed
;
whether
there
might
not
be
a
temporary
difficulty
in
"
realising
"
it
;
whether
there
might
not
even
be
a
temporary
suspension
(
say
a
month
or
so
)
,
on
the
part
of
the
wonderful
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
whispers
became
louder
,
which
they
did
from
that
time
every
minute
,
they
became
more
threatening
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
sprung
from
nothing
,
by
no
natural
growth
or
process
that
any
one
could
account
for
<EOS>
;
he
had
been
,
after
all
,
a
low
,
ignorant
fellow
;
he
had
been
a
down
-
looking
man
,
and
no
one
had
ever
been
able
to
catch
his
eye
;
he
had
been
taken
up
by
all
sorts
of
people
in
quite
an
unaccountable
manner
;
he
had
never
had
any
money
of
his
own
,
his
ventures
had
been
utterly
reckless
,
and
his
expenditure
had
been
most
enormous
.
 
<EOS>
In
steady
progression
,
as
the
day
declined
,
the
talk
rose
in
sound
and
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
left
a
letter
at
the
Baths
addressed
to
his
physician
,
and
his
physician
had
got
the
letter
,
and
the
letter
would
be
produced
at
the
Inquest
on
the
morrow
,
and
it
would
fall
like
a
thunderbolt
upon
the
multitude
he
had
deluded
.
 
<EOS>
Numbers
of
men
in
every
profession
and
trade
would
be
blighted
by
his
insolvency
;
old
people
who
had
been
in
easy
circumstances
all
their
lives
would
have
no
place
of
repentance
for
their
trust
in
him
but
the
workhouse
;
legions
of
women
and
children
would
have
their
whole
future
desolated
by
the
hand
of
this
mighty
scoundrel
.
 
<EOS>
Every
partaker
of
his
magnificent
feasts
would
be
seen
to
have
been
a
sharer
in
the
plunder
of
innumerable
homes
;
every
servile
worshipper
of
riches
who
had
helped
to
set
him
on
his
pedestal
,
would
have
done
better
to
worship
the
Devil
point
-
blank
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
talk
,
lashed
louder
and
higher
by
confirmation
on
confirmation
,
and
by
edition
after
edition
of
the
evening
papers
,
swelled
into
such
a
roar
when
night
came
,
as
might
have
brought
one
to
believe
that
a
solitary
watcher
on
the
gallery
above
the
Dome
of
St
Paul
's
would
have
perceived
the
night
air
to
be
laden
with
a
heavy
muttering
of
the
name
of
Merdle
,
coupled
with
every
form
of
execration
.
   
<EOS>
For
by
that
time
it
was
known
that
the
late
Mr
Merdle
's
complaint
had
been
simply
Forgery
and
Robbery
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
the
uncouth
object
of
such
wide
-
spread
adulation
,
the
sitter
at
great
men
's
feasts
,
the
roc
's
egg
of
great
ladies
'
assemblies
,
the
subduer
of
exclusiveness
,
the
leveller
of
pride
,
the
patron
of
patrons
,
the
bargain
-
driver
with
a
Minister
for
Lordships
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
the
recipient
of
more
acknowledgment
within
some
ten
or
fifteen
years
,
at
most
,
than
had
been
bestowed
in
England
upon
all
peaceful
public
benefactors
,
and
upon
all
the
leaders
of
all
the
Arts
and
Sciences
,
with
all
their
works
to
testify
for
them
,
during
two
centuries
at
least
---
he
,
the
shining
wonder
,
the
new
constellation
to
be
followed
by
the
wise
men
bringing
gifts
,
until
it
stopped
over
a
certain
carrion
at
the
bottom
of
a
bath
and
disappeared
---
was
simply
the
greatest
Forger
and
the
greatest
Thief
that
ever
cheated
the
gallows
.

<EOS>
Reaping
the
Whirlwind
 
With
a
precursory
sound
of
hurried
breath
and
hurried
feet
,
Mr
Pancks
rushed
into
Arthur
Clennam
's
Counting
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
Inquest
was
over
,
the
letter
was
public
,
the
Bank
was
broken
,
the
other
model
structures
of
straw
had
taken
fire
and
were
turned
to
smoke
.
<EOS>
The
admired
piratical
ship
had
blown
up
,
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
fleet
of
ships
of
all
rates
,
and
boats
of
all
sizes
;
and
on
the
deep
was
nothing
but
ruin
;
nothing
but
burning
hulls
,
bursting
magazines
,
great
guns
self
-
exploded
tearing
friends
and
neighbours
to
pieces
,
drowning
men
clinging
to
unseaworthy
spars
and
going
down
every
minute
,
spent
swimmers
floating
dead
,
and
sharks
.
   
<EOS>
The
usual
diligence
and
order
of
the
Counting
-
house
at
the
Works
were
overthrown
.
 
<EOS>
Unopened
letters
and
unsorted
papers
lay
strewn
about
the
desk
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
these
tokens
of
prostrated
energy
and
dismissed
hope
,
the
master
of
the
Counting
-
house
stood
idle
in
his
usual
place
,
with
his
arms
crossed
on
the
desk
,
and
his
head
bowed
down
upon
them
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
rushed
in
and
saw
him
,
and
stood
still
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
minute
,
Mr
Pancks
's
arms
were
on
the
desk
,
and
Mr
Pancks
's
head
was
bowed
down
upon
them
;
and
for
some
time
they
remained
in
these
attitudes
,
idle
and
silent
,
with
the
width
of
the
little
room
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
was
the
first
to
lift
up
his
head
and
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
persuaded
you
to
it
,
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it

<EOS>
Say

will

<EOS>
You
ca
n't
say
more

than
I

to

<EOS>
You
ca

say
more

I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O

Pancks
,
Pancks

returned
Clennam
,
"
do
n't
speak
of
deserving

<EOS>
What
do
I
myself
deserve

"
   
<EOS>
"
Better
luck

"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
"
pursued
Clennam
,
without
attending
to
him
,
"
who
have
ruined
my
partner
!
 
<EOS>
Pancks
,
Pancks
,
I
have
ruined
Doyce

<EOS>
The
honest
,
self
-
helpful
,
indefatigable
old
man
who
has
worked
his
way
all
through
his
life
<EOS>
;
the
man
who
has
contended
against
so
much
disappointment
,
and
who
has
brought
out
of
it
such
a
good
and
hopeful
nature
;
the
man
I
have
felt
so
much
for
,
and
meant
to
be
so
true
and
useful
to

I
have
ruined
him
---
brought
him
to
shame
and
disgrace
---
ruined
him
,
ruined
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
agony
into
which
the
reflection
wrought
his
mind
<EOS>
was
so
distressing
to
see
,
that
Mr
Pancks
took
hold
of
himself
by
the
hair
of
his
head
,
and
tore
it
in
desperation
at
the
spectacle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Reproach
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Reproach
me
,

,
or
<EOS>
I
'll
do
myself
an

<EOS>
Catch

<EOS>
Say

"
 
<EOS>
All
the
time
,
Mr
Pancks
was
tearing
at
his
tough
hair
in
a
most
pitiless
and
cruel
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
never
yielded
to
this
fatal
mania
,
Pancks
,
"
said
Clennam
,
more
in
commiseration
than
retaliation
,
"
it
would
have
been
how
much
better
for
you
,
and
how
much
better
for
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
me
again
,
sir

"
cried
Pancks
,
grinding
his
teeth
in
remorse
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
me
again
!
"
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
never
gone
into
those
accursed
calculations
,
and
brought
out
your
results
with
such
abominable
clearness
,
"
groaned
Clennam
,
"
it
would
have
been
how
much
better
for
you
,
Pancks
,
and
how
much
better
for

"
   
<EOS>
"
At
me
again
,

"
exclaimed
Pancks
,
loosening
his
hold
of
his
hair
;
"
at
me
again
,
and
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
,
however
,
finding
him
already
beginning
to
be
pacified
,
had
said
all
he
wanted
to
say
,
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrung
his
hand
,
only
adding
,
"
Blind
leaders
of
the

Pancks
!
 
<EOS>
Blind
leaders

<EOS>
But
Doyce

"
 
<EOS>
That
brought
his
head
down
on
the
desk
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
Their
former
attitudes
and
their
former
silence
were
once
more
first
encroached
upon
by
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
been
to
bed
,
sir
,
since
it
began
to
get
about

<EOS>
Been

All

All

All

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it

"
returned
Clennam
,
"
too
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
filled
up
a
pause
with
a
groan
that
came
out
of
the
very
depths
of
his
soul
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
yesterday
,
Pancks
,
"
said
Arthur
;
"
only
yesterday
,
Monday
,
I
had
the
fixed
intention
of
selling

realising

making
an
end
of

.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
as
much
for
myself

sir

"
returned
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Though
it
's
wonderful
how
many
people
I
've
heard
of
,
who
were
going
to
realise
yesterday
,
of
all
days
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
-
five
,
if
it
had
n't
been
too
late
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
steam
-
like
breathings
,
usually
droll
in
their
effect
,
were
more
tragic
than
so
many
groans
:
while
from
head
to
foot
,
he
was
in
that
begrimed
,
besmeared
,
neglected
state
,
that
he
might
have
been
an
authentic
portrait
of
Misfortune
which
could
scarcely
be
discerned
through
its
want
of
cleaning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
had
you
laid
out
---
everything
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
got
over
the
break
before
the
last
word
,
and
also
brought
out
the
last
word
itself
with
great
difficulty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Everything
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
took
hold
of
his
tough
hair
again
,
and
gave
it
such
a
wrench
that
he
pulled
out
several
prongs
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
looking
at
these
with
an
eye
of
wild
hatred
,
he
put
them
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
course

"
said
Clennam
,
brushing
away
some
tears
that
had
been
silently
dropping

What
wretched
amends
I
can
make
must
be
made
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
clear
my
unfortunate
partner
's
reputation

<EOS>
I
must
retain
nothing

myself

I

resign
to

management

so
much
abused

I
must
work
out

of

Is
it

Out
of

question
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
tided
over
now
,
Pancks

<EOS>
The
sooner
the
business
can
pass
out

my

the
better
for
it

<EOS>
There
are
engagements
to
be
met
,
this
week
,
which
would
bring
the
catastrophe
before
many
days
were
over
,
even
if
I
would
postpone
it
for
a
single
day
by
going
on
for
that
space
,
secretly
knowing
what
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
All
last
night
I
thought
of
what
I
would
do
;
what
remains
is
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
entirely
of
yourself
?
"
said
Pancks
,
whose
face
was
as
damp
as
if
his
steam
were
turning
into
water
as
fast
as
he
dismally
blew
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
some
legal
help
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
had
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
Rugg
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
much
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
do
it
as
well
as
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
fetch
Rugg
,
Mr
Clennam
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
spare
the
time
,
I
should
be
much
obliged
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
put
on
his
hat
that
moment
,
and
steamed
away
to
Pentonville
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
gone
<EOS>
Arthur
never
raised
his
head
from
the
desk
,
but
remained
in
that
one
position
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
brought
his
friend
and
professional
adviser
,
Mr
Rugg
,
back
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
had
had
such
ample
experience
,
on
the
road
,
of
Mr
Pancks
's
being
at
that
present
in
an
irrational
state
of
mind
,
that
he
opened
his
professional
mediation
by
requesting
that
gentleman
to
take
himself
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
crushed
and
submissive
,
obeyed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
not
unlike
what
my
daughter
was
,
sir
,
when
we
began
the
Breach
of
Promise
action
of
Rugg
and
Bawkins
,
in
which
she
was
Plaintiff
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
takes
too
strong
and
direct
an
interest
in
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
His
feelings
are
worked
upon
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
getting
on
,
in
our
profession
,
with
feelings
worked
upon
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
pulled
off
his
gloves
and
put
them
in
his
hat
,
he
saw
,
in
a
side
glance
or
two
,
that
a
great
change
had
come
over
his
client
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
perceive
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
"
that
you
have
been
allowing
your
own
feelings
to
be
worked
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
pray
do
n't
,
pray
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
These
losses
are
much
to
be
deplored
,
sir
,
but
we
must
look
'em
in
the
face
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
the
money
I
have
sacrificed
had
been
all
my
own
,
Mr
Rugg
,
"
sighed
Mr
Clennam
,
"
I
should
have
cared
far
less
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
rubbing
his
hands
with
a
cheerful
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
singular
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
generally
found
,
in
my
experience
,
that
it
's
their
own
money
people
are
most
particular
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
people
get
rid
of
a
good
deal
of
other
people
's
money
,
and
bear
it
very
well
:
very
well
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
comforting
remarks
,
Mr
Rugg
seated
himself
on
an
office
-
stool
at
the
desk
and
proceeded
to
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Clennam
,
by
your
leave
,
let
us
go
into
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
see
the
state
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
The
question
is
simple
.
 
<EOS>
The
question
is
the
usual
plain
,
straightforward
,
common
-
sense
question
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
we
do
for
ourself
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
we
do
for
ourself
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
the
question
with
me
,
Mr
Rugg
,
"
said
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
it
in
the
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
what
can
I
do
for
my
partner
,
how
can
I
best
make
reparation
to
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
sir
,
do
you
know
,
"
argued
Mr
Rugg
persuasively
,
"
that
you
are
still
allowing
your
feeling
to
be
worked
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
the
term
"
reparation
,
"
sir
,
except
as
a
lever
in
the
hands
of
counsel
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
excuse
my
saying
that
I
feel
it
my
duty
to
offer
you
the
caution
,
that
you
really
must
not
allow
your
feelings
to
be
worked
upon
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Rugg
,
"
said
Clennam
,
nerving
himself
to
go
through
with
what
he
had
resolved
upon
,
and
surprising
that
gentleman
by
appearing
,
in
his
despondency
,
to
have
a
settled
determination
of
purpose
;
"
you
give
me
the
impression
that
you
will
not
be
much
disposed
to
adopt
the
course
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
If
your
disapproval
of
it
should
render
you
unwilling
to
discharge
such
business
as
it
necessitates
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
and
must
seek
other
aid
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
represent
to
you
at
once
,
that
to
argue
against
it
with
me
is
useless
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
sir
,
"
answered
Mr
Rugg
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Since
the
business
is
to
be
done
by
some
hands
,
let
it
be
done
by
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
my
principle
in
the
case
of
Rugg
and
Bawkins
.
 
<EOS>
Such
is
my
principle
in
most
cases
.
 
<EOS>
"
   
Clennam
then
proceeded
to
state
to
Mr
Rugg
<EOS>
his
fixed
resolution
.
<EOS>
He
told
Mr
Rugg
that
his
partner
was
a
man
of
great
simplicity
and
integrity
,
and
that
in
all
he
meant
to
do
,
he
was
guided
above
all
things
by
a
knowledge
of
his
partner
's
character
,
and
a
respect
for
his
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
He
explained
that
his
partner
was
then
absent
on
an
enterprise
of
importance
,
and
that
it
particularly
behoved
himself
publicly
to
accept
the
blame
of
what
he
had
rashly
done
,
and
publicly
to
exonerate
his
partner
from
all
participation
in
the
responsibility
of
it
,
lest
the
successful
conduct
of
that
enterprise
should
be
endangered
by
the
slightest
suspicion
wrongly
attaching
to
his
partner
's
honour
and
credit
in
another
country
.
<EOS>
He
told
Mr
Rugg
that
to
clear
his
partner
morally
,
to
the
fullest
extent
,
and
publicly
and
unreservedly
to
declare
that
he
,
Arthur
Clennam
,
of
that
Firm
,
had
of
his
own
sole
act
,
and
even
expressly
against
his
partner
's
caution
,
embarked
its
resources
in
the
swindles
that
had
lately
perished
,
was
the
only
real
atonement
within
his
power
;
was
a
better
atonement
to
the
particular
man
than
it
would
be
to
many
men
;
and
was
therefore
the
atonement
he
had
first
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
his
intention
was
to
print
a
declaration
to
the
foregoing
effect
,
which
he
had
already
drawn
up
;
and
,
besides
circulating
it
among
all
who
had
dealings
with
the
House
,
to
advertise
it
in
the
public
papers
.
 
<EOS>
Concurrently
with
this
measure
(
the
description
of
which
cost
Mr
Rugg
innumerable
wry
faces
and
great
uneasiness
in
his
limbs
)
,
he
would
address
a
letter
to
all
the
creditors
,
exonerating
his
partner
in
a
solemn
manner
,
informing
them
of
the
stoppage
of
the
House
until
their
pleasure
could
be
known
and
his
partner
communicated
with
,
and
humbly
submitting
himself
to
their
direction
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
through
their
consideration
for
his
partner
's
innocence
,
the
affairs
could
ever
be
got
into
such
train
as
that
the
business
could
be
profitably
resumed
,
and
its
present
downfall
overcome
,
then
his
own
share
in
it
should
revert
to
his
partner
,
as
the
only
reparation
he
could
make
to
him
in
money
value
for
the
distress
and
loss
he
had
unhappily
brought
upon
him
,
and
he
himself
,
at
as
mall
a
salary
as
he
could
live
upon
,
would
ask
to
be
allowed
to
serve
the
business
as
a
faithful
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
Though
Mr
Rugg
saw
plainly
there
was
no
preventing
this
from
being
done
,
still
the
wryness
of
his
face
and
the
uneasiness
of
his
limbs
so
sorely
required
the
propitiation
of
a
Protest
,
that
he
made
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
offer
no
objection
,
sir
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
argue
no
point
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
carry
out
your
views
,
sir
;
but
,
under
protest
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
then
stated
,
not
without
prolixity
,
the
heads
of
his
protest
.
<EOS>
These
were
,
in
effect
,
because
the
whole
town
,
or
he
might
say
the
whole
country
,
was
in
the
first
madness
of
the
late
discovery
,
and
the
resentment
against
the
victims
would
be
very
strong
:
those
who
had
not
been
deluded
being
certain
to
wax
exceedingly
wroth
with
them
for
not
having
been
as
wise
as
they
were
:
and
those
who
had
been
deluded
being
certain
to
find
excuses
and
reasons
for
themselves
,
of
which
they
were
equally
certain
to
see
that
other
sufferers
were
wholly
devoid
:
not
to
mention
the
great
probability
of
every
individual
sufferer
persuading
himself
,
to
his
violent
indignation
,
that
<EOS>
but
for
the
example
of
all
the
other
sufferers
he
never
would
have
put
himself
in
the
way
of
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
Because
such
a
declaration
as
Clennam
's
,
made
at
such
a
time
,
would
certainly
draw
down
upon
him
a
storm
of
animosity
,
rendering
it
impossible
to
calculate
on
forbearance
in
the
creditors
,
or
on
unanimity
among
them
;
and
exposing
him
a
solitary
target
to
a
straggling
cross
-
fire
,
which
might
bring
him
down
from
half
-
a
-
dozen
quarters
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
To
all
this
Clennam
merely
replied
that
,
granting
the
whole
protest
,
nothing
in
it
lessened
the
force
,
or
could
lessen
the
force
,
of
the
voluntary
and
public
exoneration
of
his
partner
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
once
and
for
all
,
requested
Mr
Rugg
's
immediate
aid
in
getting
the
business
despatched
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
Mr
Rugg
fell
to
work
;
and
Arthur
,
retaining
no
property
to
himself
but
his
clothes
and
books
,
and
a
little
loose
money
,
placed
his
small
private
banker's
-
account
with
the
papers
of
the
business
.
   
<EOS>
The
disclosure
was
made
,
and
the
storm
raged
fearfully
.
 
<EOS>
Thousands
of
people
were
wildly
staring
about
for
somebody
alive
to
heap
reproaches
on
;
and
this
notable
case
,
courting
publicity
,
set
the
living
somebody
so
much
wanted
,
on
a
scaffold
.
 
<EOS>
When
people
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
were
so
sensible
of
its
flagrancy
,
people
who
lost
money
by
it
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
deal
mildly
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Letters
of
reproach
and
invective
showered
in
from
the
creditors
;
and
Mr
Rugg
,
who
sat
upon
the
high
stool
every
day
and
read
them
all
,
informed
his
client
within
a
week
that
he
feared
there
were
writs
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
the
consequences
of
what
I
have
done
,
"
said
Clennam
.
<EOS>
"
The
writs
will
find
me
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
the
very
next
morning
,
as
he
was
turning
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
by
Mrs
Plornish
's
corner
,
Mrs
Plornish
stood
at
the
door
waiting
for
him
,
and
mysteriously
besought
him
to
step
into
Happy
Cottage
.
<EOS>
There
he
found
Mr
Rugg
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
'd
wait
for
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
go
on
to
the
Counting
-
house
this
morning
if
I
was
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
Mr
Rugg
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
as
many
as
five
out
,
to
my
knowledge
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
too
soon
over
,
"
said
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
them
take
me
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
getting
between
him
and
the
door
,
"
hear
reason
,
<EOS>
hear
reason
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
take
you
soon
enough
,
Mr
Clennam
,
I
do
n't
doubt
;
but
,
hear
reason
.
 
<EOS>
It
almost
always
happens
,
in
these
cases
,
that
some
insignificant
matter
pushes
itself
in
front
and
makes
much
of
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
find
there
's
a
little
one
out
---
a
mere
Palace
Court
jurisdiction
---
<EOS>
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
caption
may
be
made
upon
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
taken
upon
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
asked
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
be
taken
on
a
full
-
grown
one
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
as
well
to
keep
up
appearances
.
 
<EOS>
As
your
professional
adviser
,
I
should
prefer
your
being
taken
on
a
writ
from
one
of
the
Superior
Courts
,
if
you
have
no
objection
to
do
me
that
favour
.
 
<EOS>
It
looks
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Rugg
,
"
said
Arthur
,
in
his
dejection
,
"
my
only
wish
is
,
that
it
should
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
on
,
and
take
my
chance
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Another
word
of
reason
,
sir
!
"
cried
Mr
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
this
is
reason
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
may
be
taste
;
but
this
is
reason
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
be
taken
on
a
little
one
,
sir
,
you
would
go
to
the
Marshalsea
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
what
the
Marshalsea
is
.
 
<EOS>
Very
close
.
 
<EOS>
Excessively
confined
.
 
<EOS>
Whereas
in
the
King
's
Bench
<EOS>
---
"
Mr
Rugg
waved
his
right
hand
freely
,
as
expressing
abundance
of
space
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
be
taken
to
the
Marshalsea
than
to
any
other
prison
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
say
so
indeed
,
sir
?
"
returned
Mr
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
this
is
taste
,
too
,
and
we
may
be
walking
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
offended
at
first
,
but
he
soon
overlooked
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
walked
through
the
Yard
to
the
other
end
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bleeding
Hearts
were
more
interested
in
Arthur
since
his
reverses
than
formerly
;
now
regarding
him
as
one
who
was
true
to
the
place
and
had
taken
up
his
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
them
came
out
to
look
after
him
,
and
to
observe
to
one
another
,
with
great
unctuousness
,
that
he
was
"
pulled
down
by
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
and
her
father
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steps
at
their
own
end
,
much
depressed
and
shaking
their
heads
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
visibly
in
waiting
when
Arthur
and
Mr
Rugg
arrived
at
the
Counting
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
an
elderly
member
of
the
Jewish
persuasion
,
preserved
in
rum
,
followed
them
close
,
and
looked
in
at
the
glass
before
Mr
Rugg
had
opened
one
of
the
day
's
letters
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
Step
in
---
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
I
think
this
is
the
gentleman
I
was
mentioning
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
gentleman
explained
the
object
of
his
visit
to
be
"
a
tyfling
madder
ob
bithznithz
,
"
and
executed
his
legal
function
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
accompany
you
,
Mr
Clennam
?
"
asked
Mr
Rugg
politely
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
go
alone
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Be
so
good
as
send
me
my
clothes
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
in
a
light
airy
way
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
shook
hands
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
attendant
then
went
downstairs
,
got
into
the
first
conveyance
they
found
,
and
drove
to
the
old
gates
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
I
little
thought
,
Heaven
forgive
me
,
"
said
Clennam
to
himself
,
"
that
I
should
ever
enter
thus
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chivery
was
on
the
Lock
,
and
Young
John
was
in
the
Lodge
:
either
newly
released
from
it
,
or
waiting
to
take
his
own
spell
of
duty
.
<EOS>
Both
were
more
astonished
on
seeing
who
the
prisoner
was
,
than
one
might
have
thought
turnkeys
would
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
The
elder
Mr
Chivery
shook
hands
with
him
in
a
shame
-
faced
kind
of
way
,
and
said
,
"
I
do
n't
call
to
mind
,
sir
,
as
I
was
ever
less
glad
to
see
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
younger
Mr
Chivery
,
more
distant
,
did
not
shake
hands
with
him
at
all
;
he
stood
looking
at
him
in
a
state
of
indecision
<EOS>
so
observable
that
it
even
came
within
the
observation
of
Clennam
with
his
heavy
eyes
and
heavy
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
afterwards
,
Young
John
disappeared
into
the
jail
.
   
<EOS>
As
Clennam
knew
enough
of
the
place
to
know
that
he
was
required
to
remain
in
the
Lodge
a
certain
time
,
he
took
a
seat
in
a
corner
,
and
feigned
to
be
occupied
with
the
perusal
of
letters
from
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
They
did
not
so
engross
his
attention
,
but
that
he
saw
,
with
gratitude
,
how
the
elder
Mr
Chivery
kept
the
Lodge
clear
of
prisoners
;
how
he
signed
to
some
,
with
his
keys
,
not
to
come
in
,
how
he
nudged
others
with
his
elbows
to
go
out
,
and
how
he
made
his
misery
as
easy
to
him
as
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
,
recalling
the
past
,
brooding
over
the
present
,
and
not
attending
to
either
,
when
he
felt
himself
touched
upon
the
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
by
Young
John
;
and
he
said
,
"
You
can
come
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
got
up
and
followed
Young
John
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
gone
a
step
or
two
within
the
inner
iron
-
gate
,
Young
John
turned
and
said
to
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
want
a
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
you
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
heartily
.
"
   
<EOS>
Young
John
turned
again
,
and
took
him
in
at
the
old
doorway
,
up
the
old
staircase
,
into
the
old
room
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
stretched
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Young
John
looked
at
it
,
looked
at
him
---
<EOS>
sternly
---
swelled
,
choked
,
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
find
I
ca
n't
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
thought
you
'd
like
the
room
,
and
here
it
is
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Surprise
at
this
inconsistent
behaviour
yielded
when
he
was
gone
<EOS>
(
he
went
away
directly
)
to
the
feelings
which
the
empty
room
awakened
in
Clennam
's
wounded
breast
,
and
to
the
crowding
associations
with
the
one
good
and
gentle
creature
who
had
sanctified
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
absence
in
his
altered
fortunes
made
it
,
and
him
in
it
,
so
very
desolate
and
so
much
in
need
of
such
a
face
of
love
and
truth
,
that
he
turned
against
the
wall
to
weep
,
sobbing
out
,
as
his
heart
relieved
itself
,
"
O
my
Little
Dorrit
!

The
Pupil
of
the
Marshalsea
 
<EOS>
The
day
was
sunny
,
and
the
Marshalsea
,
with
the
hot
noon
striking
upon
it
,
was
unwontedly
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
dropped
into
a
solitary
arm
-
chair
,
itself
as
faded
as
any
debtor
in
the
jail
,
and
yielded
himself
to
his
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
unnatural
peace
of
having
gone
through
the
dreaded
arrest
,
and
got
there
,
---
the
first
change
of
feeling
which
the
prison
most
commonly
induced
,
and
from
which
dangerous
resting
-
place
so
many
men
had
slipped
down
to
the
depths
of
degradation
and
disgrace
by
so
many
ways
,
---
he
could
think
of
some
passages
in
his
life
,
almost
as
if
he
were
removed
from
them
into
another
state
of
existence
.
<EOS>
Taking
into
account
where
he
was
,
the
interest
that
had
first
brought
him
there
when
he
had
been
free
to
keep
away
,
and
the
gentle
presence
that
was
equally
inseparable
from
the
walls
and
bars
about
him
and
from
the
impalpable
remembrances
of
his
later
life
which
no
walls
or
bars
could
imprison
,
it
was
not
remarkable
that
everything
his
memory
turned
upon
should
bring
him
round
again
to
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
remarkable
to
him
;
not
because
of
the
fact
itself
,
but
because
of
the
reminder
it
brought
with
it
,
how
much
the
dear
little
creature
had
influenced
his
better
resolutions
.
   
<EOS>
None
of
us
clearly
know
to
whom
or
to
what
we
are
indebted
in
this
wise
,
until
some
marked
stop
in
the
whirling
wheel
of
life
brings
the
right
perception
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
comes
with
sickness
<EOS>
,
it
comes
with
sorrow
,
it
comes
with
the
loss
of
the
dearly
loved
,
it
is
one
of
the
most
frequent
uses
of
adversity
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
to
Clennam
in
his
adversity
,
strongly
and
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
first
gathered
myself
together
,
"
he
thought
,
"
and
set
something
like
purpose
before
my
jaded
eyes
,
whom
had
I
before
me
,
toiling
on
,
for
a
good
object
's
sake
,
without
encouragement
,
without
notice
,
against
ignoble
obstacles
that
would
have
turned
an
army
of
received
heroes
and
heroines
?
 
<EOS>
One
weak
girl
!
 
<EOS>
When
I
tried
to
conquer
my
misplaced
love
,
and
to
be
generous
to
the
man
who
was
more
fortunate
than
I
,
though
he
should
never
know
it
or
repay
me
with
a
gracious
word
,
in
whom
had
I
watched
patience
,
self
-
denial
,
self
-
subdual
,
charitable
construction
,
the
noblest
generosity
of
the
affections
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
same
poor
girl
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
,
a
man
,
with
a
man
's
advantages
and
means
and
energies
,
had
slighted
the
whisper
in
my
heart
,
that
if
my
father
had
erred
,
it
was
my
first
duty
to
conceal
the
fault
and
to
repair
it
,
what
youthful
figure
with
tender
feet
going
almost
bare
on
the
damp
ground
,
with
spare
hands
ever
working
,
with
its
slight
shape
but
half
protected
from
the
sharp
weather
,
would
have
stood
before
me
to
put
me
to
shame
?
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
always
as
he
sat
alone
in
the
faded
chair
,
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
Always
,
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Until
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
met
the
reward
of
having
wandered
away
from
her
,
and
suffered
anything
to
pass
between
him
and
his
remembrance
of
her
virtues
.
   
<EOS>
His
door
was
opened
,
and
the
head
of
the
elder
Chivery
was
put
in
a
very
little
way
,
without
being
turned
towards
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
off
the
Lock
,
Mr
Clennam
,
and
going
out
.
 
<EOS>
Can
I
do
anything
for
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Many
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
excuse
me
opening
the
door
,
"
said
Mr
Chivery
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
could
n't
make
you
hear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
knock
?
"
<EOS>
"
Half
-
a
-
dozen
times
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rousing
himself
,
Clennam
observed
that
the
prison
had
awakened
from
its
noontide
doze
,
that
the
inmates
were
loitering
about
the
shady
yard
,
and
that
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
thinking
for
hours
.
<EOS>
"
Your
things
is
come
,
"
said
Mr
Chivery
,
"
and
my
son
is
going
to
carry
'em
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
sent
'em
up
but
for
his
wishing
to
carry
'em
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
would
have
'em
himself
,
and
so
I
could
n't
send
'em
up
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
could
I
say
a
word
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
come
in
,
"
said
Arthur
;
for
Mr
Chivery
's
head
was
still
put
in
at
the
door
a
very
little
way
,
and
Mr
Chivery
had
<EOS>
but
one
ear
upon
him
,
instead
of
both
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
native
delicacy
in
Mr
Chivery
 
---
true
politeness
;
though
his
exterior
had
very
much
of
a
turnkey
about
it
,
and
not
the
least
of
a
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chivery
,
without
advancing
;
<EOS>
"
it
's
no
odds
me
coming
in
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
do
n't
you
take
no
notice
of
my
son
(
if
you
'll
be
so
good
)
in
case
you
find
him
cut
up
anyways
difficult
.
<EOS>
My
son
has
a
"
art
,
and
my
son
's
"
art
is
in
the
right
place
.
 
<EOS>
Me
and
his
mother
knows
where
to
find
it
,
and
we
find
it
sitiwated
correct
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
mysterious
speech
,
Mr
Chivery
took
his
ear
away
and
shut
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
gone
ten
minutes
,
when
his
son
succeeded
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
portmanteau
,
"
he
said
to
Arthur
,
putting
it
carefully
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
kind
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
that
you
should
have
the
trouble
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
gone
before
it
came
to
that
;
but
soon
returned
,
saying
exactly
as
before
,
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
black
box
:
"
which
he
also
put
down
with
care
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sensible
of
this
attention
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
we
may
shake
hands
now
,
Mr
John
.
"
   
<EOS>
Young
John
,
however
,
drew
back
,
turning
his
right
wrist
in
a
socket
made
of
his
left
thumb
and
middle
-
finger
and
said
as
he
had
said
at
first
,
"
I
do
n't
know
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
I
find
I
ca
n't
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
stood
regarding
the
prisoner
sternly
,
though
with
a
swelling
humour
in
his
eyes
that
looked
like
pity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
angry
with
me
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
and
yet
so
ready
to
do
me
these
kind
services
?
 
<EOS>
There
must
be
some
mistake
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
done
anything
to
occasion
it
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
mistake
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
,
turning
the
wrist
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
socket
,
for
which
it
was
rather
tight
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
mistake
,
sir
,
in
the
feelings
with
which
my
eyes
behold
you
at
the
present
moment
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
at
all
fairly
equal
to
your
weight
,
Mr
Clennam
---
which
I
am
not
;
and
if
you
were
n't
under
a
cloud
---
which
you
are
;
and
if
it
was
n't
against
all
rules
of
the
Marshalsea
---
which
it
is
;
those
feelings
are
such
,
that
they
would
stimulate
me
,
more
to
having
it
out
with
you
in
a
Round
on
the
present
spot
than
to
anything
else
I
could
name
.
"
<EOS>
Arthur
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
some
wonder
,
and
some
little
anger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
mistake
,
a
mistake
!
"
 
<EOS>
Turning
away
,
he
sat
down
with
a
heavy
sigh
in
the
faded
chair
again
.
   
<EOS>
Young
John
followed
him
with
his
eyes
,
and
,
after
a
short
pause
,
cried
out
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Freely
granted
,
"
said
Clennam
,
waving
his
hand
without
raising
his
sunken
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
no
more

<EOS>
I
am
not
worth
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
furniture
,
sir
,
"
said
Young
John
in
a
voice
of
mild
and
soft
explanation
,
"
belongs
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
the
habit
of
letting
it
out
to
parties
without
furniture
,
that
have
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
an't
much
,
but
it
's
at
your
service
.
 
<EOS>
Free
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
think
of
letting
you
have
it
on
any
other
terms
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
welcome
to
it
for
nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
raised
his
head
again
to
thank
him
,
and
to
say
he
could
not
accept
the
favour
.
 
<EOS>
John
was
still
turning
his
wrist
,
and
still
contending
with
himself
in
his
former
divided
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
between
us
?
"
said
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
decline
to
name
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
Young
John
,
suddenly
turning
loud
and
sharp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
's
the
matter
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
looked
at
him
again
,
in
vain
,
for
an
explanation
of
his
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
Arthur
turned
away
his
head
again
.
<EOS>
Young
John
said
,
presently
afterwards
,
with
the
utmost
mildness
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
little
round
table
<EOS>
,
sir
,
that
's
nigh
your
elbow
,
was
---
<EOS>
you
know
whose
---
I
need
n't
mention
him
---
he
died
a
great
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
bought
it
of
an
individual
that
he
gave
it
to
,
and
that
lived
here
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
individual
was
n't
any
ways
equal
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Most
individuals
would
find
it
hard
to
come
up
to
his
level
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
drew
the
little
table
nearer
,
rested
his
arm
upon
it
,
and
kept
it
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
may
not
be
aware
,
sir
,
"
said
Young
John
,
"
that
I
intruded
upon
him
when
he
was
over
here
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
he
was
of
opinion
that
it
WAS
an
intrusion
,
though
he
was
so
good
as
to
ask
me
to
sit
down
and
to
inquire
after
father
and
all
other
old
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Leastways
humblest
acquaintances
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
,
to
me
,
a
good
deal
changed
,
and
I
said
so
when
I
came
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
if
Miss
Amy
was
well
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
And
she
was
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
you
would
have
known
without
putting
the
question
to
such
as
me
,
"
returned
Young
John
,
after
appearing
to
take
a
large
invisible
pill
.
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
do
put
me
the
question
,
I
am
sorry
I
ca
n't
answer
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
truth
is
,
he
looked
upon
the
inquiry
as
a
liberty
,
and
said
,
"
What
was
that
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
was
then
I
became
quite
aware
I
was
intruding
:
of
which
I
had
been
fearful
before
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
spoke
very
handsome
afterwards
;
very
handsome
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
both
silent
for
several
minutes
:
except
that
Young
John
remarked
,
at
about
the
middle
of
the
pause
,
"
He
both
spoke
and
acted
very
handsome
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
again
Young
John
who
broke
the
silence
by
inquiring
:
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
not
a
liberty
,
how
long
may
it
be
your
intentions
,
sir
,
to
go
without
eating
and
drinking
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
felt
the
want
of
anything
yet
,
"
returned
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
appetite
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
more
reason
why
you
should
take
some
support
,
sir
,
"
urged
Young
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
find
yourself
going
on
sitting
here
for
hours
and
hours
partaking
of
no
refreshment
because
you
have
no
appetite
,
why
then
you
should
and
must
partake
of
refreshment
without
an
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
have
tea
in
my
own
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
's
not
a
liberty
,
please
to
come
and
take
a
cup
.
 
<EOS>
Or
I
can
bring
a
tray
here
in
two
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Feeling
that
Young
John
would
impose
that
trouble
on
himself
if
he
refused
,
and
also
feeling
anxious
to
show
that
he
bore
in
mind
both
the
elder
<EOS>
Mr
Chivery
's
entreaty
,
and
the
younger
Mr
Chivery
's
apology
<EOS>
,
Arthur
rose
and
expressed
his
willingness
to
take
a
cup
of
tea
in
Mr
john
's
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
Young
John
locked
his
door
for
him
as
they
went
out
,
slided
the
key
into
his
pocket
with
great
dexterity
,
and
led
the
way
to
his
own
residence
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
nearest
to
the
gateway
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
room
to
which
Clennam
had
hurried
on
the
day
when
the
enriched
family
had
left
the
prison
for
ever
,
and
where
he
had
lifted
her
insensible
from
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
foresaw
where
they
were
going
as
soon
as
their
feet
touched
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
so
far
changed
that
it
was
papered
now
,
and
had
been
repainted
,
and
was
far
more
comfortably
furnished
;
but
he
could
recall
it
just
as
he
had
seen
it
in
that
single
glance
,
when
he
raised
her
from
the
ground
and
carried
her
down
to
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
Young
John
looked
hard
at
him
,
biting
his
fingers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
recollect
the
room
,
Mr
Clennam
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
it
well
,
Heaven
bless
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oblivious
of
the
tea
<EOS>
,
Young
John
continued
to
bite
his
fingers
and
to
look
at
his
visitor
,
as
long
as
his
visitor
continued
to
glance
about
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
he
made
a
start
at
the
teapot
,
gustily
rattled
a
quantity
of
tea
into
it
from
a
canister
,
and
set
off
for
the
common
kitchen
to
fill
it
with
hot
water
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
was
so
eloquent
to
Clennam
in
the
changed
circumstances
of
his
return
to
the
miserable
Marshalsea
;
it
spoke
to
him
so
mournfully
of
her
,
and
of
his
loss
of
her
;
that
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
him
to
resist
it
,
even
though
he
had
not
been
alone
.
<EOS>
Alone
,
he
did
not
try
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
hand
on
the
insensible
wall
as
tenderly
as
if
it
had
been
herself
that
he
touched
,
and
pronounced
her
name
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
at
the
window
,
looking
over
the
prison
-
parapet
with
its
grim
spiked
border
,
and
breathed
a
benediction
through
the
summer
haze
towards
the
distant
land
where
she
was
rich
and
prosperous
.
   
<EOS>
Young
John
was
some
time
absent
,
and
,
when
he
came
back
,
showed
that
he
had
been
outside
by
bringing
with
him
fresh
butter
in
a
cabbage
leaf
,
some
thin
slices
of
boiled
ham
in
another
cabbage
leaf
,
and
a
little
basket
of
water
-
cresses
and
salad
herbs
.
 
<EOS>
When
these
were
arranged
upon
the
table
to
his
satisfaction
,
they
sat
down
to
tea
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
tried
to
do
honour
to
the
meal
,
but
unavailingly
.
 
<EOS>
The
ham
sickened
him
,
the
bread
seemed
to
turn
to
sand
in
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
force
nothing
upon
himself
but
a
cup
of
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Try
a
little
something
green
,
"
said
Young
John
,
handing
him
the
basket
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
a
sprig
or
so
of
water
-
cress
,
and
tried
again
;
but
the
bread
turned
to
a
heavier
sand
than
before
,
and
the
ham
(
though
it
was
good
enough
of
itself
)
seemed
to
blow
a
faint
simoom
of
ham
through
the
whole
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Try
a
little
more
something
green
,
sir
,
"
said
Young
John
;
and
again
handed
the
basket
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
so
like
handing
green
meat
into
the
cage
of
a
dull
imprisoned
bird
,
and
John
had
so
evidently
brought
the
little
basket
as
a
handful
of
fresh
relief
from
the
stale
hot
paving
-
stones
and
bricks
of
the
jail
,
that
Clennam
said
,
with
a
smile
,
"
<EOS>
It
was
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
putting
this
between
the
wires
;
but
I
can
not
even
get
this
down
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
if
the
difficulty
were
contagious
,
Young
John
soon
pushed
away
his
own
plate
,
and
fell
to
folding
the
cabbage
-
leaf
that
had
contained
the
ham
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
folded
it
into
a
number
of
layers
,
one
over
another
,
so
that
it
was
small
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
he
began
to
flatten
it
between
both
his
hands
,
and
to
eye
Clennam
attentively
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
he
at
length
said
,
compressing
his
green
packet
with
some
force
,
"
that
if
it
's
not
worth
your
while
to
take
care
of
yourself
for
your
own
sake
,
it
's
not
worth
doing
for
some
one
else
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
with
a
sigh
and
a
smile
,
"
I
do
n't
know
for
whose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
John
,
warmly
,
"
I
am
surprised
that
a
gentleman
who
is
capable
of
the
straightforwardness
that
you
are
capable
of
,
should
be
capable
of
the
mean
action
of
making
me
such
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
I
am
surprised
that
a
gentleman
who
is
capable
of
having
a
heart
of
his
own
,
should
be
capable
of
the
heartlessness
of
treating
mine
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
astonished
at
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Really
<EOS>
and
truly
I
am
astonished
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
got
upon
his
feet
to
emphasise
his
concluding
words
,
Young
John
sat
down
again
,
and
fell
to
rolling
his
green
packet
on
his
right
leg
;
never
taking
his
eyes
off
Clennam
,
but
surveying
him
with
a
fixed
look
of
indignant
reproach
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
got
over
it
,
sir
,
"
said
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
conquered
it
,
knowing
that
it
must
be
conquered
,
and
had
come
to
the
resolution
to
think
no
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
given
my
mind
to
it
again
,
I
hope
,
if
to
this
prison
you
had
not
been
brought
,
and
in
an
hour
unfortunate
for
me
,
this
day
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
In
his
agitation
Young
John
adopted
his
mother
's
powerful
construction
of
sentences
.
)
<EOS>
"
When
you
first
came
upon
me
,
sir
,
in
the
Lodge
,
this
day
,
more
as
if
a
Upas
tree
had
been
made
a
capture
of
than
a
private
defendant
,
such
mingled
streams
of
feelings
broke
loose
again
within
me
,
that
everything
was
for
the
first
few
minutes
swept
away
before
them
,
and
I
was
going
round
and
round
in
a
vortex
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
struggled
,
and
got
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
was
the
last
word
I
had
to
speak
,
against
that
vortex
with
my
utmost
powers
<EOS>
I
strove
,
and
out
of
it
I
came
.
 
<EOS>
I
argued
that
if
I
had
been
rude
,
apologies
was
due
,
and
those
apologies
without
a
question
of
demeaning
,
I
did
make
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
when
I
've
been
so
wishful
to
show
that
one
thought
is
next
to
being
a
holy
one
with
me
and
goes
before
all
others
---
now
,
after
all
,
you
dodge
me
when
I
ever
so
gently
hint
at
it
,
and
throw
me
back
upon
myself
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
do
not
,
sir
,
"
said
Young
John
,
"
do
not
be
so
base
as
to
deny
that
dodge
you
do
,
and
thrown
me
back
upon
myself
you
have
!
"
   
<EOS>
All
amazement
,
Arthur
gazed
at
him
like
one
lost
,
only
saying
,
"
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
,
John
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
John
,
being
in
that
state
of
mind
in
which
nothing
would
seem
to
be
more
impossible
to
a
certain
class
of
people
than
the
giving
of
an
answer
,
went
ahead
blindly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
n't
,
"
John
declared
,
"
no
,
I
had
n't
,
and
I
never
had
the
audaciousness
to
think
,
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
that
all
was
anything
but
lost
.
<EOS>
I
had
n't
,
no
,
why
should
I
say
I
had
n't
if
I
ever
had
,
<EOS>
any
hope
that
it
was
possible
to
be
so
blest
,
not
after
the
words
that
passed
,
not
even
if
barriers
insurmountable
had
not
been
raised
!
<EOS>
But
is
that
a
reason
why
I
am
to
have
no
memory
,
why
I
am
to
have
no
thoughts
,
why
I
am
to
have
no
sacred
spots
,
nor
anything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
mean
?
"
cried
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
to
trample
on
it
,
sir
,
"
John
went
on
,
scouring
a
very
prairie
of
wild
words
,
"
if
a
person
can
make
up
his
mind
to
be
guilty
of
the
action
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
well
to
trample
on
it
,
but
it
's
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
it
could
n't
be
trampled
upon
if
it
was
n't
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
does
n't
make
it
gentlemanly
<EOS>
,
that
does
n't
make
it
honourable
,
that
does
n't
justify
throwing
a
person
back
upon
himself
after
he
has
struggled
and
strived
out
of
himself
like
a
butterfly
.
 
<EOS>
The
world
may
sneer
at
a
turnkey
,
but
he
's
a
man
---
when
he
is
n't
a
woman
,
which
among
female
criminals
he
's
expected
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ridiculous
as
the
incoherence
of
his
talk
was
<EOS>
,
there
was
yet
a
truthfulness
in
Young
john
's
simple
,
sentimental
character
,
and
a
sense
of
being
wounded
in
some
very
tender
respect
,
expressed
in
his
burning
face
and
in
the
agitation
of
his
voice
and
manner
,
which
Arthur
must
have
been
cruel
to
disregard
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
his
thoughts
back
to
the
starting
-
point
of
this
unknown
injury
;
and
in
the
meantime
Young
John
,
having
rolled
his
green
packet
pretty
round
,
cut
it
carefully
into
three
pieces
,
and
laid
it
on
a
plate
as
if
it
were
some
particular
delicacy
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
just
possible
,
"
said
Arthur
,
when
he
had
retraced
the
conversation
to
the
water
-
cresses
and
back
again
,
"
that
you
have
made
some
reference
to
Miss
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
just
possible
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
Chivery
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
not
be
so
unlucky
as
to
make
you
think
I
mean
to
offend
you
again
,
<EOS>
for
I
never
have
meant
to
offend
you
yet
,
when
I
say
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Young
John
,
"
will
you
have
the
perfidy
to
deny
that
you
know
and
long
have
known
that
I
felt
towards
Miss
Dorrit
,
call
it
not
the
presumption
of
love
,
but
adoration
and
sacrifice
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
John
,
I
will
not
have
any
perfidy
if
I
know
it
;
why
you
should
suspect
me
of
it
<EOS>
I
am
at
a
loss
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
from
Mrs
Chivery
,
your
mother
,
that
I
went
to
see
her
once
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
,
shortly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
heard
of
such
a
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
imagine
why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
,
shortly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
imagine
why
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
solicitous
to
promote
Miss
Dorrit
's
happiness
;
and
if
I
could
have
supposed
that
Miss
Dorrit
returned
your
affection
---
"
   
Poor
John
Chivery
turned
crimson
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dorrit
never
did
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
be
honourable
and
true
,
so
far
as
in
my
humble
way
I
can
,
and
I
would
scorn
to
pretend
for
a
moment
that
she
ever
did
,
or
that
she
ever
led
me
to
believe
she
did
;
no
,
nor
even
that
it
was
ever
to
be
expected
in
any
cool
reason
<EOS>
that
she
would
or
could
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
far
above
me
in
all
respects
at
all
times
.
 
<EOS>
As
likewise
,
"
added
John
,
"
similarly
was
her
gen
-
teel
family
.
"
<EOS>
His
chivalrous
feeling
towards
all
that
belonged
to
her
made
him
so
very
respectable
,
in
spite
of
his
small
stature
and
his
rather
weak
legs
,
and
his
very
weak
hair
,
and
his
poetical
temperament
,
that
a
Goliath
might
have
sat
in
his
place
demanding
less
consideration
at
Arthur
's
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
speak
,
john
,
"
he
said
,
with
cordial
admiration
,
"
like
a
Man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
,
brushing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
   
<EOS>
"
then
I
wish
you
'd
do
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
quick
with
this
unexpected
retort
,
and
it
again
made
Arthur
regard
him
with
a
wondering
expression
of
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Leastways
,
"
said
John
,
stretching
his
hand
across
the
tea
-
tray
,
"
if
too
strong
a
remark
,
withdrawn
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
why
not
,
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
say
to
you
,
Mr
Clennam
,
take
care
of
yourself
for
some
one
else
's
sake
,
why
not
be
open
,
though
a
turnkey
?
 
<EOS>
Why
did
I
get
you
the
room
which
I
knew
you
'd
like
best
?
 
<EOS>
Why
did
I
carry
up
your
things
?
   
<EOS>
Not
that
I
found
'em
heavy
;
I
do
n't
mention
'em
on
that
accounts
;
far
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
have
I
cultivated
you
in
the
manner
I
have
done
since
the
morning
?
 
<EOS>
On
the
ground
of
your
own
merits
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
very
great
<EOS>
,
I
've
no
doubt
at
all
;
but
not
on
the
ground
of
them
.
<EOS>
Another
's
merits
have
had
their
weight
,
and
have
had
far
more
weight
with
Me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
why
not
speak
free
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unaffectedly
,
John
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
you
are
so
good
<EOS>
a
fellow
<EOS>
and
I
have
so
true
a
respect
for
your
character
,
that
if
I
have
appeared
to
be
less
sensible
than
I
really
am
of
the
fact
that
the
kind
services
you
have
rendered
me
to
-
day
are
attributable
to
my
having
been
trusted
by
Miss
Dorrit
as
her
friend
---
I
confess
it
to
be
a
fault
,
and
I
ask
your
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
why
not
,
"
John
repeated
with
returning
scorn
,
"
why
not
speak
free
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
declare
to
you
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
"
that
I
do
not
understand
you
.
   
<EOS>
Look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
Consider
the
trouble
I
have
been
in
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
likely
that
I
would
wilfully
add
to
my
other
self
-
reproaches
,
that
of
being
ungrateful
or
treacherous
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
john
's
incredulous
face
slowly
softened
into
a
face
of
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
,
backed
into
the
garret
-
window
of
the
room
,
beckoned
Arthur
to
come
there
,
and
stood
looking
at
him
thoughtfully
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
n't
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
John
?
"
   
"
Lord
,
"
said
Young
John
,
appealing
with
a
gasp
to
the
spikes
on
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
says
,
What
!
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
looked
at
the
spikes
,
and
looked
at
John
;
and
looked
at
the
spikes
,
and
looked
at
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
says
What
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
is
more
,
"
exclaimed
Young
John
,
surveying
him
in
a
doleful
maze
,
"
he
appears
to
mean
it
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
this
window
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
see
this
window
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
See
this
room
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
I
see
this
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
wall
opposite
,
and
that
yard
down
below
?
 
<EOS>
They
have
all
been
witnesses
of
it
,
from
day
to
day
,
from
night
to
night
,
from
week
to
week
,
from
month
to
month
.
 
<EOS>
For
how
often
have
I
seen
Miss
Dorrit
here
when
she
has
not
seen
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Witnesses
of
what
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
Miss
Dorrit
's
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
whom
?
"
   
"
You
,
"
said
John
.
 
<EOS>
And
touched
him
with
the
back
of
his
hand
upon
the
breast
,
and
backed
to
his
chair
,
and
sat
down
on
it
with
a
pale
face
,
holding
the
arms
,
and
shaking
his
head
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
If
he
had
dealt
Clennam
a
heavy
blow
,
instead
of
laying
that
light
touch
upon
him
,
its
effect
could
not
have
been
to
shake
him
more
.
<EOS>
He
stood
amazed
;
his
eyes
looking
at
John
;
his
lips
parted
,
and
seeming
now
and
then
to
form
the
word
"
Me
!
"
<EOS>
without
uttering
it
;
his
hands
dropped
at
his
sides
;
his
whole
appearance
that
of
a
man
who
has
been
awakened
from
sleep
,
and
stupefied
by
intelligence
beyond
his
full
comprehension
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
!
"
<EOS>
he
at
length
said
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
groaned
Young
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
what
he
could
to
muster
a
smile
,
and
returned
,
"
Your
fancy
.
<EOS>
You
are
completely
mistaken
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mistaken
,
sir
!
"
said
Young
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
\I\
completely
mistaken
on
that
subject
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
Mr
Clennam
,
do
n't
tell
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
On
any
other
,
if
you
like
,
for
I
do
n't
set
up
to
be
a
penetrating
character
,
and
am
well
aware
of
my
own
deficiencies
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
\I\
mistaken
on
a
point
that
has
caused
me
more
smart
in
my
breast
than
a
flight
of
savages
'
arrows
could
have
done
!
 
<EOS>
\I\
mistaken
on
a
point
that
almost
sent
me
into
my
grave
,
as
I
sometimes
wished
it
would
,
if
the
grave
could
only
have
been
made
compatible
with
the
tobacco
-
business
and
father
and
mother
's
feelings
!
 
<EOS>
I
mistaken
on
a
point
that
,
even
at
the
present
moment
,
makes
me
take
out
my
pocket
-
handkercher
like
a
great
girl
,
as
people
say
:
though
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
why
a
great
girl
should
be
a
term
of
reproach
,
for
every
rightly
constituted
male
mind
loves
'em
great
and
small
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
so
,
do
n't
tell
me
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
Still
highly
respectable
at
bottom
,
though
absurd
enough
upon
the
surface
,
Young
John
took
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
with
a
genuine
absence
both
of
display
and
concealment
,
which
is
only
to
be
seen
in
a
man
with
a
great
deal
of
good
in
him
,
when
he
takes
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
for
the
purpose
of
wiping
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Having
dried
them
,
and
indulged
in
the
harmless
luxury
of
a
sob
and
a
sniff
,
he
put
it
up
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
touch
was
still
in
its
influence
so
like
a
blow
that
Arthur
could
not
get
many
words
together
to
close
the
subject
with
.
 
<EOS>
He
assured
John
Chivery
when
he
had
returned
his
handkerchief
to
his
pocket
,
that
he
did
all
honour
to
his
disinterestedness
and
to
the
fidelity
of
his
remembrance
of
Miss
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
impression
on
his
mind
,
of
which
he
had
just
relieved
it
---
here
John
interposed
,
and
said
,
"
No
impression
!
 
<EOS>
Certainty
!
<EOS>
"
---
as
to
that
,
they
might
perhaps
speak
of
it
at
another
time
,
but
would
say
no
more
now
.
 
<EOS>
Feeling
low
-
spirited
and
weary
,
he
would
go
back
to
his
room
,
with
john
's
leave
,
and
come
out
no
more
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
John
assented
,
and
he
crept
back
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
to
his
own
lodging
.
   
<EOS>
The
feeling
of
the
blow
was
still
so
strong
upon
him
that
,
when
the
dirty
old
woman
was
gone
whom
he
found
sitting
on
the
stairs
outside
his
door
,
waiting
to
make
his
bed
,
and
who
gave
him
to
understand
while
doing
it
,
that
she
had
received
her
instructions
from
Mr
Chivery
,
"
<EOS>
not
the
old
'
un
but
the
young
'
un
<EOS>
,
"
he
sat
down
in
the
faded
arm
-
chair
,
pressing
his
head
between
his
hands
,
as
if
he
had
been
stunned
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
love
him
!
 
<EOS>
More
bewildering
to
him
than
his
misery
,
far
.
   
<EOS>
Consider
the
improbability
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
accustomed
to
call
her
his
child
,
and
his
dear
child
,
and
to
invite
her
confidence
by
dwelling
upon
the
difference
in
their
respective
ages
,
and
to
speak
of
himself
as
one
who
was
turning
old
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
she
might
not
have
thought
him
old
.
 
<EOS>
Something
reminded
him
that
he
had
not
thought
himself
so
,
until
the
roses
had
floated
away
upon
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
her
two
letters
among
other
papers
in
his
box
,
and
he
took
them
out
and
read
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
a
sound
in
them
like
the
sound
of
her
sweet
voice
.
 
<EOS>
It
fell
upon
his
ear
with
many
tones
of
tenderness
,
that
were
not
insusceptible
of
the
new
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
was
that
the
quiet
desolation
of
her
answer
,
"
No
,
No
,
No
,
"
made
to
him
that
night
in
that
very
room
---
that
night
when
he
had
been
shown
the
dawn
of
her
altered
fortune
,
and
when
other
words
had
passed
between
them
which
he
had
been
destined
to
remember
in
humiliation
and
a
prisoner
,
rushed
into
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Consider
the
improbability
.
   
<EOS>
But
it
had
a
preponderating
tendency
,
when
considered
,
to
become
fainter
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
and
a
curious
inquiry
of
his
own
heart
's
that
concurrently
became
stronger
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
reluctance
he
had
felt
to
believe
that
she
loved
any
one
;
in
his
desire
to
set
that
question
at
rest
;
in
a
half
-
formed
consciousness
he
had
had
that
there
would
be
a
kind
of
nobleness
in
his
helping
her
love
for
any
one
,
was
there
no
suppressed
something
on
his
own
side
that
he
had
hushed
as
it
arose
?
 
<EOS>
Had
he
ever
whispered
to
himself
that
he
must
not
think
of
such
a
thing
as
her
loving
him
,
that
he
must
not
take
advantage
of
her
gratitude
,
that
he
must
keep
his
experience
in
remembrance
as
a
warning
and
reproof
;
that
he
must
regard
such
youthful
hopes
as
having
passed
away
,
as
his
friend
's
dead
daughter
had
passed
away
;
that
he
must
be
steady
in
saying
to
himself
that
the
time
had
gone
by
him
,
and
he
was
too
saddened
and
old
?
   
<EOS>
He
had
kissed
her
when
he
raised
her
from
the
ground
on
the
day
when
she
had
been
so
consistently
and
expressively
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Quite
as
he
might
have
kissed
her
,
if
she
had
been
conscious
?
 
<EOS>
No
difference
?
   
<EOS>
The
darkness
found
him
occupied
with
these
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
The
darkness
also
found
Mr
and
Mrs
Plornish
knocking
at
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
They
brought
with
them
a
basket
,
filled
with
choice
selections
from
that
stock
in
trade
which
met
with
such
a
quick
sale
and
produced
such
a
slow
return
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
was
affected
to
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Plornish
amiably
growled
,
in
his
philosophical
but
not
lucid
manner
,
that
there
was
ups
you
see
,
and
there
was
downs
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
to
ask
why
ups
,
why
downs
;
there
they
was
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
heerd
it
given
for
a
truth
that
accordin
'
as
the
world
went
round
,
which
round
it
did
rewolve
undoubted
<EOS>
,
even
the
best
of
gentlemen
must
take
his
turn
of
standing
with
his
ed
upside
down
and
<EOS>
all
his
air
a
flying
the
wrong
way
into
what
you
might
call
Space
.
 
<EOS>
Wery
<EOS>
well
then
.
 
<EOS>
What
Mr
Plornish
said
was
,
wery
well
then
.
 
<EOS>
That
gentleman
's
ed
would
come
up
-
ards
when
his
turn
come
,
that
gentleman
's
air
would
be
a
pleasure
to
look
upon
being
all
smooth
again
,
and
wery
well
then
!
   
<EOS>
It
has
been
already
stated
that
Mrs
Plornish
,
not
being
philosophical
,
wept
.
 
<EOS>
It
further
happened
that
Mrs
Plornish
,
not
being
philosophical
,
was
intelligible
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
arisen
out
of
her
softened
state
of
mind
,
out
of
her
sex
's
wit
,
out
of
a
woman
's
quick
association
of
ideas
,
or
out
of
a
woman
's
no
association
of
ideas
,
but
it
further
happened
somehow
that
Mrs
Plornish
's
intelligibility
displayed
itself
upon
the
very
subject
of
Arthur
's
meditations
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
way
father
has
been
talking
about
you
,
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
you
hardly
would
believe
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
made
him
quite
poorly
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
voice
,
this
misfortune
has
took
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
a
sweet
singer
father
is
;
but
he
could
n't
get
a
note
out
for
the
children
at
tea
,
if
you
'll
credit
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
While
speaking
,
Mrs
Plornish
shook
her
head
,
and
wiped
her
eyes
,
and
looked
retrospectively
about
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Baptist
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
whatever
he
'll
do
when
he
comes
to
know
of
it
,
I
ca
n't
conceive
nor
yet
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
He
'd
have
been
here
before
now
,
you
may
be
sure
,
but
that
he
's
away
on
confidential
business
of
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
The
persevering
manner
in
which
he
follows
up
that
business
,
and
gives
himself
no
rest
from
it
<EOS>
---
it
really
do
,
"
said
Mrs
Plornish
,
winding
up
in
the
Italian
manner
,
"
as
I
say
to
him
,
Mooshattonisha
padrona
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Though
not
conceited
,
Mrs
Plornish
felt
that
she
had
turned
this
Tuscan
sentence
with
peculiar
elegance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Plornish
could
not
conceal
his
exultation
in
her
accomplishments
as
a
linguist
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
I
say
is
,
Mr
Clennam
,
"
the
good
woman
went
on
,
"
there
's
always
something
to
be
thankful
for
,
as
I
am
sure
you
will
yourself
admit
.
 
<EOS>
Speaking
in
this
room
,
it
's
not
hard
to
think
what
the
present
something
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
thing
to
be
thankful
for
,
indeed
,
that
Miss
Dorrit
is
not
here
to
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
thought
she
looked
at
him
with
particular
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
thing
,
"
reiterated
Mrs
Plornish
,
"
to
be
thankful
for
,
indeed
,
that
Miss
Dorrit
is
far
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
to
be
hoped
she
is
not
likely
to
hear
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
here
to
see
it
,
sir
,
it
's
not
to
be
doubted
that
the
sight
of
you
,
"
Mrs
Plornish
repeated
those
words
---
"
not
to
be
doubted
,
that
the
sight
of
you
---
in
misfortune
and
trouble
,
would
have
been
almost
too
much
for
her
affectionate
heart
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
I
can
think
of
,
that
would
have
touched
Miss
Dorrit
so
bad
as
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Of
a
certainty
Mrs
Plornish
did
look
at
him
now
,
with
a
sort
of
quivering
defiance
in
her
friendly
emotion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
it
shows
what
notice
father
takes
,
though
at
his
time
of
life
,
that
he
says
to
me
this
afternoon
,
which
Happy
Cottage
knows
I
neither
make
it
up
nor
any
ways
enlarge
,
"
Mary
<EOS>
,
it
's
much
to
be
rejoiced
in
that
Miss
Dorrit
<EOS>
is
not
on
the
spot
to
behold
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Those
were
father
's
words
.
 
<EOS>
Father
's
own
words
was
,
"
Much
to
be
rejoiced
in
,
Mary
,
that
Miss
Dorrit
is
not
on
the
spot
to
behold
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
says
to
father
then
<EOS>
,
I
says
to
him
,
"
Father
,
you
are
right
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
,
"
Mrs
Plornish
concluded
,
with
the
air
of
a
very
precise
legal
witness
,
"
is
what
passed
betwixt
father
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
tell
you
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
did
pass
betwixt
me
and
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Plornish
,
as
being
of
a
more
laconic
temperament
,
embraced
this
opportunity
of
interposing
with
the
suggestion
that
she
should
now
leave
Mr
Clennam
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Plornish
,
gravely
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
what
it
is
,
old
gal
;
"
repeating
that
valuable
remark
several
times
,
as
if
it
appeared
to
him
to
include
some
great
moral
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
the
worthy
couple
went
away
arm
in
arm
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
for
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Always
Little
Dorrit
!
   
<EOS>
Happily
,
if
it
ever
had
been
so
,
it
was
over
,
and
better
over
.
<EOS>
Granted
that
she
had
loved
him
,
and
he
had
known
it
and
had
suffered
himself
to
love
her
,
what
a
road
to
have
led
her
away
upon
---
the
road
that
would
have
brought
her
back
to
this
miserable
place
!
 
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
much
comforted
by
the
reflection
that
she
was
quit
of
it
forever
;
that
she
was
,
or
would
soon
be
,
married
<EOS>
(
vague
rumours
of
her
father
's
projects
in
that
direction
had
reached
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
with
the
news
of
her
sister
's
marriage
)
;
and
that
the
Marshalsea
gate
had
shut
for
ever
on
all
those
perplexed
possibilities
of
a
time
that
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
Dear
Little
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
Looking
back
upon
his
own
poor
story
,
she
was
its
vanishing
-
point
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
in
its
perspective
led
to
her
innocent
figure
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
travelled
thousands
of
miles
towards
it
;
previous
unquiet
hopes
and
doubts
had
worked
themselves
out
before
it
;
it
was
the
centre
of
the
interest
of
his
life
;
it
was
the
termination
of
everything
that
was
good
and
pleasant
in
it
;
beyond
,
there
was
nothing
but
mere
waste
and
darkened
sky
.
   
<EOS>
As
ill
at
ease
as
on
the
first
night
of
his
lying
down
to
sleep
within
those
dreary
walls
,
he
wore
the
night
out
with
such
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
What
time
Young
John
lay
wrapt
in
peaceful
slumber
,
after
composing
and
arranging
the
following
monumental
inscription
on
his
pillow
---
             
Stranger
!
     
<EOS>
Respect
the
tomb
of
     
John
Chivery
,
Junior
,
     
who
died
at
an
advanced
age
     
not
necessary
to
mention
.
     
<EOS>
he
encountered
his
rival
in
a
distressed
state
,
     
and
felt
inclined
     
to
have
a
round
with
him
;
     
but
,
for
the
sake
of
the
loved
one
,
conquered
those
feelings
     
of
bitterness
,
and
became
     
magnanimous
.

<EOS>
An
Appearance
in
the
Marshalsea
 
<EOS>
The
opinion
of
the
community
outside
the
prison
gates
bore
hard
on
Clennam
as
time
went
on
,
and
he
made
no
friends
among
the
community
within
.
 
<EOS>
Too
depressed
to
associate
with
the
herd
in
the
yard
,
who
got
together
to
forget
their
cares
;
too
retiring
and
too
unhappy
to
join
in
the
poor
socialities
of
the
tavern
;
he
kept
his
own
room
,
and
was
held
in
distrust
.
 
<EOS>
Some
said
he
was
proud
;
some
objected
that
he
was
sullen
and
reserved
;
some
were
contemptuous
of
him
,
for
that
he
was
a
poor
-
spirited
dog
who
pined
under
his
debts
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
population
were
shy
of
him
on
these
various
counts
of
indictment
,
but
especially
the
last
,
which
involved
a
species
of
domestic
treason
;
and
he
soon
became
so
confirmed
in
his
seclusion
,
that
his
only
time
for
walking
up
and
down
was
when
the
evening
Club
were
assembled
at
their
songs
and
toasts
and
sentiments
,
and
when
the
yard
was
nearly
left
to
the
women
and
children
.
   
<EOS>
Imprisonment
began
to
tell
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
idled
and
moped
.
 
<EOS>
After
what
he
had
known
of
the
influences
of
imprisonment
within
the
four
small
walls
of
the
very
room
he
occupied
,
this
consciousness
made
him
afraid
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Shrinking
from
the
observation
of
other
men
,
and
shrinking
from
his
own
,
he
began
to
change
very
sensibly
.
 
<EOS>
Anybody
might
see
that
the
shadow
of
the
wall
was
dark
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
One
day
when
he
might
have
been
some
ten
or
twelve
weeks
in
jail
,
and
when
he
had
been
trying
to
read
and
had
not
been
able
to
release
even
the
imaginary
people
of
the
book
from
the
Marshalsea
,
a
footstep
stopped
at
his
door
,
and
a
hand
tapped
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
arose
and
opened
it
,
and
an
agreeable
voice
accosted
him
with
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Clennam
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
am
not
unwelcome
in
calling
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
sprightly
young
Barnacle
,
Ferdinand
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
very
good
-
natured
and
prepossessing
,
though
overpoweringly
gay
and
free
,
in
contrast
with
the
squalid
prison
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
surprised
to
see
me
,
Mr
Clennam
,
"
he
said
,
taking
the
seat
which
Clennam
offered
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
to
being
much
surprised
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
disagreeably
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Frankly
,
"
said
the
engaging
young
Barnacle
,
"
I
have
been
excessively
sorry
to
hear
that
you
were
under
the
necessity
of
a
temporary
retirement
here
,
and
<EOS>
I
hope
(
of
course
as
between
two
private
gentlemen
)
that
our
place
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
office
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Our
Circumlocution
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
charge
any
part
of
my
reverses
upon
that
remarkable
establishment
.
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
,
"
said
the
vivacious
young
Barnacle
,
"
I
am
heartily
glad
to
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
quite
a
relief
to
me
to
hear
you
say
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
so
exceedingly
regretted
our
place
having
had
anything
to
do
with
your
difficulties
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
again
assured
him
that
he
absolved
it
of
the
responsibility
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
said
Ferdinand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
rather
afraid
in
my
own
mind
that
we
might
have
helped
to
floor
you
,
because
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
our
misfortune
to
do
that
kind
of
thing
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
want
to
do
it
;
but
if
men
will
be
gravelled
,
why
---
we
ca
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Without
giving
an
unqualified
assent
to
what
you
say
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
gloomily
,
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
interest
in
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
but
really
!
 
<EOS>
Our
place
is
,
"
said
the
easy
young
Barnacle
,
"
the
most
inoffensive
place
possible
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
say
we
are
a
humbug
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
say
we
are
not
;
but
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
intended
to
be
,
and
must
be
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
regard
it
from
the
right
point
of
view
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
point
of
view
that
is
the
essential
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Regard
our
place
from
the
point
of
view
<EOS>
that
we
only
ask
you
to
leave
us
alone
,
and
we
are
as
capital
a
Department
as
you
'll
find
anywhere
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
your
place
there
to
be
left
alone
?
"
asked
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
exactly
hit
it
,
"
returned
Ferdinand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
there
with
the
express
intention
that
everything
shall
be
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
what
it
means
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
what
it
's
for
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
there
's
a
certain
form
to
be
kept
up
that
it
's
for
something
else
,
but
it
's
only
a
form
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
good
Heaven
,
we
are
nothing
but
forms
!
 
<EOS>
Think
what
a
lot
of
our
forms
you
have
gone
through
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
have
never
got
any
nearer
to
an
end
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
it
from
the
right
point
of
view
,
and
there
you
have
us
---
official
and
effectual
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
like
a
limited
game
of
cricket
.
 
<EOS>
A
field
of
outsiders
are
always
going
in
to
bowl
at
the
Public
Service
,
and
we
block
the
balls
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
asked
what
became
of
the
bowlers
?
 
<EOS>
The
airy
young
Barnacle
replied
that
they
grew
tired
,
got
dead
beat
,
got
lamed
,
got
their
backs
broken
,
died
off
,
gave
it
up
,
went
in
for
other
games
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
this
occasions
me
to
congratulate
myself
again
<EOS>
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
on
the
circumstance
that
our
place
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
your
temporary
retirement
.
 
<EOS>
It
very
easily
might
have
had
a
hand
in
it
;
because
it
is
undeniable
that
we
are
sometimes
a
most
unlucky
place
,
in
our
effects
upon
people
who
will
not
leave
us
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
I
am
quite
unreserved
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
As
between
yourself
and
myself
,
I
know
I
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
,
when
I
first
saw
you
making
the
mistake
of
not
leaving
us
alone
;
because
I
perceived
that
you
were
inexperienced
and
sanguine
,
and
had
<EOS>
---
I
hope
you
'll
not
object
to
my
saying
---
some
simplicity
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Some
simplicity
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
felt
what
a
pity
it
was
,
and
I
went
out
of
my
way
to
hint
to
you
(
<EOS>
which
really
was
not
official
,
but
I
never
am
official
when
I
can
help
it
)
<EOS>
something
to
the
effect
that
if
I
were
you
,
I
would
n't
bother
myself
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
you
did
bother
yourself
,
and
you
have
since
bothered
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
do
n't
do
it
any
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
likely
to
have
the
opportunity
,
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
You
'll
leave
here
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
leaves
here
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
ends
of
ways
of
leaving
here
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
do
n't
come
back
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
That
entreaty
is
the
second
object
of
my
call
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
do
n't
come
back
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
"
said
Ferdinand
in
a
very
friendly
and
confiding
way
,
"
I
shall
be
greatly
vexed
if
you
do
n't
take
warning
by
the
past
and
keep
away
from
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
the
invention
?
"
said
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
fellow
,
"
returned
Ferdinand
,
"
if
you
'll
excuse
the
freedom
of
that
form
of
address
,
nobody
wants
to
know
of
the
invention
,
and
nobody
cares
twopence
-
halfpenny
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
in
the
Office
,
that
is
to
say
?
"
   
"
Nor
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
is
ready
to
dislike
and
ridicule
any
invention
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
how
many
people
want
to
be
left
alone
.
   
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
how
the
Genius
of
the
country
(
overlook
the
Parliamentary
nature
of
the
phrase
,
and
do
n't
be
bored
by
it
<EOS>
)
tends
to
being
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
Mr
Clennam
,
"
said
the
sprightly
young
Barnacle
in
his
pleasantest
manner
,
"
our
place
is
not
a
wicked
Giant
to
be
charged
at
full
tilt
;
but
only
a
windmill
showing
you
,
as
it
grinds
immense
quantities
of
chaff
,
which
way
the
country
wind
blows
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
believe
that
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
it
would
be
a
dismal
prospect
for
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
Do
n't
say
so
!
"
returned
Ferdinand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
humbug
,
we
all
like
humbug
,
we
could
n't
get
on
without
humbug
.
   
<EOS>
A
little
humbug
,
and
a
groove
,
and
everything
goes
on
admirably
,
if
you
leave
it
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
hopeful
confession
of
his
faith
as
the
head
of
the
rising
Barnacles
who
were
born
of
woman
,
to
be
followed
under
a
variety
of
watchwords
which
they
utterly
repudiated
and
disbelieved
,
Ferdinand
rose
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
than
his
frank
and
courteous
bearing
,
or
adapted
with
a
more
gentlemanly
instinct
to
the
circumstances
of
his
visit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
fair
to
ask
,
"
he
said
,
as
Clennam
gave
him
his
hand
with
a
real
feeling
of
thankfulness
for
his
candour
and
good
-
humour
,
"
whether
it
is
true
that
our
late
lamented
Merdle
is
the
cause
of
this
passing
inconvenience
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
one
of
the
many
he
has
ruined
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
been
an
exceedingly
clever
fellow
,
"
said
Ferdinand
Barnacle
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
,
not
being
in
the
mood
to
extol
the
memory
of
the
deceased
,
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
consummate
rascal
,
of
course
,
"
said
Ferdinand
,
"
but
remarkably
clever
!
 
<EOS>
One
can
not
help
admiring
the
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Must
have
been
such
a
master
of
humbug
.
 
<EOS>
Knew
people
so
well
---
got
over
them
so
completely
---
did
so
much
with
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
In
his
easy
way
,
he
was
really
moved
to
genuine
admiration
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
that
he
and
his
dupes
may
be
a
warning
to
people
not
to
have
so
much
done
with
them
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Clennam
,
"
returned
Ferdinand
,
laughing
,
"
<EOS>
have
you
really
such
a
verdant
hope
?
 
<EOS>
The
next
man
who
has
as
large
a
capacity
and
as
genuine
a
taste
for
swindling
,
will
succeed
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
really
have
no
idea
how
the
human
bees
will
swarm
to
the
beating
of
any
old
tin
kettle
;
in
that
fact
lies
the
complete
manual
of
governing
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
can
be
got
to
believe
that
the
kettle
is
made
of
the
precious
metals
,
in
that
fact
lies
the
whole
power
of
men
like
our
late
lamented
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
there
are
here
and
there
,
"
said
Ferdinand
politely
,
"
exceptional
cases
,
where
people
have
been
taken
in
for
what
appeared
to
them
to
be
much
better
reasons
;
and
I
need
not
go
far
to
find
such
a
case
;
but
they
do
n't
invalidate
the
rule
.
 
<EOS>
Good
day
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
that
when
I
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
,
next
,
this
passing
cloud
will
have
given
place
to
sunshine
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
come
a
step
beyond
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
way
out
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
Good
day
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
the
best
and
brightest
of
the
Barnacles
went
down
-
stairs
,
hummed
his
way
through
the
Lodge
,
mounted
his
horse
in
the
front
court
-
yard
,
and
rode
off
to
keep
an
appointment
with
his
noble
kinsman
,
who
wanted
a
little
coaching
before
he
could
triumphantly
answer
certain
infidel
Snobs
who
were
going
to
question
the
Nobs
about
their
statesmanship
.
   
<EOS>
He
must
have
passed
Mr
Rugg
on
his
way
out
,
for
,
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
,
that
ruddy
-
headed
gentleman
shone
in
at
the
door
,
like
an
elderly
Phoebus
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
to
-
day
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
little
thing
I
can
do
for
you
to
-
day
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
's
enjoyment
of
embarrassed
affairs
was
like
a
housekeeper
's
enjoyment
in
pickling
and
preserving
,
or
a
washerwoman
's
enjoyment
of
a
heavy
wash
,
or
a
dustman
's
enjoyment
of
an
overflowing
dust
-
bin
,
or
any
other
professional
enjoyment
of
a
mess
in
the
way
of
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
still
look
round
,
from
time
to
time
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
cheerfully
,
"
to
see
whether
any
lingering
Detainers
are
accumulating
at
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
fallen
in
pretty
thick
,
sir
;
as
thick
as
we
could
have
expected
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
remarked
upon
the
circumstance
as
if
it
were
matter
of
congratulation
:
rubbing
his
hands
briskly
,
and
rolling
his
head
a
little
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
thick
,
"
repeated
Mr
Rugg
,
"
as
we
could
reasonably
have
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
a
shower
-
bath
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
often
intrude
upon
you
now
,
when
I
look
round
,
because
I
know
you
are
not
inclined
for
company
,
and
that
if
you
wished
to
see
me
,
you
would
leave
word
in
the
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
here
pretty
well
every
day
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Would
this
be
an
unseasonable
time
,
sir
,
"
asked
Mr
Rugg
,
coaxingly
,
"
for
me
to
offer
an
observation
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
seasonable
a
time
as
any
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
 
<EOS>
Public
opinion
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
"
has
been
busy
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Might
it
not
be
advisable
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
more
coaxingly
yet
,
"
now
to
make
,
at
last
and
after
all
,
a
trifling
concession
to
public
opinion
?
 
<EOS>
We
all
do
it
in
one
way
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
we
must
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
set
myself
right
with
it
,
Mr
Rugg
,
and
have
no
business
to
expect
that
I
ever
shall
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
sir
,
do
n't
say
that
.
 
<EOS>
The
cost
of
being
moved
to
the
Bench
is
almost
insignificant
,
and
if
the
general
feeling
is
strong
that
you
ought
to
be
there
,
why
---
really
---
"
   
"
I
thought
you
had
settled
,
Mr
Rugg
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
that
my
determination
to
remain
here
was
a
matter
of
taste
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
But
is
it
good
taste
,
is
it
good
taste
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
Question
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
was
so
soothingly
persuasive
as
to
be
quite
pathetic
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
almost
going
to
say
,
is
it
good
feeling
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
an
extensive
affair
of
yours
;
and
your
remaining
here
where
a
man
can
come
for
a
pound
or
two
,
is
remarked
upon
as
not
in
keeping
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
keeping
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
sir
,
in
how
many
quarters
I
heard
it
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
comments
made
upon
it
last
night
in
a
Parlour
frequented
by
what
I
should
call
,
if
I
did
not
look
in
there
now
and
then
myself
,
the
best
legal
company
---
I
heard
,
there
,
comments
on
it
that
I
was
sorry
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
They
hurt
me
on
your
account
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
only
this
morning
at
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
My
daughter
(
but
a
woman
,
you
'll
say
:
yet
still
with
a
feeling
for
these
things
,
and
even
with
some
little
personal
experience
,
as
the
plaintiff
in
Rugg
and
Bawkins
)
was
expressing
her
great
surprise
;
her
great
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
Now
under
these
circumstances
,
and
considering
that
none
of
us
can
quite
set
ourselves
above
public
opinion
,
would
n't
a
trifling
concession
to
that
opinion
be
---
 
Come
,
sir
,
"
said
Rugg
,
"
I
will
put
it
on
the
lowest
ground
of
argument
,
and
say
,
amiable
?
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
's
thoughts
had
once
more
wandered
away
to
Little
Dorrit
,
and
the
question
remained
unanswered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
myself
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
hoping
that
his
eloquence
had
reduced
him
to
a
state
of
indecision
<EOS>
,
"
it
is
a
principle
of
mine
not
to
consider
myself
when
a
client
's
inclinations
are
in
the
scale
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
knowing
your
considerate
character
and
general
wish
to
oblige
,
I
will
repeat
that
I
should
prefer
your
being
in
the
Bench
.
   
<EOS>
Your
case
has
made
a
noise
;
it
is
a
creditable
case
to
be
professionally
concerned
in
;
I
should
feel
on
a
better
standing
with
my
connection
,
if
you
went
to
the
Bench
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
that
influence
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
merely
state
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
So
errant
had
the
prisoner
's
attention
already
grown
in
solitude
and
dejection
,
and
so
accustomed
had
it
become
to
commune
with
only
one
silent
figure
within
the
ever
-
frowning
walls
,
that
Clennam
had
to
shake
off
a
kind
of
stupor
before
he
could
look
at
Mr
Rugg
,
recall
the
thread
of
his
talk
,
and
hurriedly
say
,
"
I
am
unchanged
,
and
unchangeable
,
in
my
decision
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
let
it
be
;
let
it
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
,
without
concealing
that
he
was
nettled
and
mortified
,
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Beyond
a
doubt
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
travelled
out
of
the
record
,
sir
,
I
am
aware
,
in
putting
the
point
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
really
,
when
I
herd
it
remarked
in
several
companies
,
and
in
very
good
company
,
that
however
worthy
of
a
foreigner
,
it
is
not
worthy
of
the
spirit
of
an
Englishman
to
remain
in
the
Marshalsea
when
the
glorious
liberties
of
his
island
home
admit
of
his
removal
to
the
Bench
,
I
thought
I
would
depart
from
the
narrow
professional
line
marked
out
to
me
,
and
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
Personally
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
no
opinion
on
the
topic
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
That
's
well

returned
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
None
at
all
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
,
I
should
have
been
   
unwilling
,
some
minutes
ago
,
to
see
a
client
of
mine
visited
in
this
place
by
a
gentleman
of
a
high
family
riding
a
saddle

horse

But
it
was
not
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
,
I
might
have
wished
to
be
now
empowered
to
mention
to
another
gentleman
,
a
gentleman
of
military
   
exterior
at
present
waiting
in
the
Lodge
,
that
my
client
had
never
intended
to
remain
here
,
and
was
on
the
eve
of
removal
to
a
superior
abode
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
course
as
a
professional
machine
is
clear
;
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
your
good
pleasure
to
see
the
gentleman
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
waiting
to
see
me
,
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
take
that
unprofessional
liberty
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
that
I
was
your
professional
adviser
,
he
declined
to
interpose
before
my
very
limited
function
was
performed
.
 
<EOS>
Happily
,
"
said
Mr
Rugg
,
with
sarcasm
,
"
I
did
not
so
far
travel
out
of
the
record
as
to
ask
the
gentleman
for
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
have
no
resource
but
to
see
him
,
"
sighed
Clennam
,
wearily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
it
IS
your
good
pleasure
,
sir
?
"
retorted
Rugg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
honoured
by
your
instructions
to
mention
as
much
to
the
gentleman
,
as
I
pass
out
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
?
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
my
leave
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
leave
<EOS>
he
took
accordingly
,
in
dudgeon
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
of
military
exterior
had
so
imperfectly
awakened
Clennam
's
curiosity
,
in
the
existing
state
of
his
mind
,
that
a
half
-
forgetfulness
of
such
a
visitor
's
having
been
referred
to
,
was
already
creeping
over
it
as
a
part
of
the
sombre
veil
which
almost
always
dimmed
it
now
,
when
a
heavy
footstep
on
the
stairs
aroused
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
ascend
them
,
not
very
promptly
or
spontaneously
,
yet
with
a
display
of
stride
and
clatter
meant
to
be
insulting
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
landing
outside
his
door
,
he
could
not
recall
his
association
with
the
peculiarity
of
its
sound
,
though
he
thought
he
had
one
.
 
<EOS>
Only
a
moment
was
given
him
for
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
His
door
was
immediately
swung
open
by
a
thump
,
and
in
the
doorway
stood
the
missing
Blandois
,
the
cause
of
many
anxieties
.
   
<EOS>
"
Salve
,
fellow
jail
-
bird
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
want
me
,
it
seems
.
 
<EOS>
Here
I
am
!
"
   
<EOS>
Before
Arthur
could
speak
to
him
in
his
indignant
wonder
,
Cavalletto
followed
him
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
followed
Cavalletto
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
of
the
two
had
been
there
since
its
present
occupant
had
had
possession
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
breathing
hard
,
sidled
near
the
window
,
put
his
hat
on
the
ground
,
stirred
his
hair
up
with
both
hands
,
and
folded
his
arms
,
like
a
man
who
had
come
to
a
pause
in
a
hard
day
's
work
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
,
never
taking
his
eyes
from
his
dreaded
chum
of
old
,
softly
sat
down
on
the
floor
with
his
back
against
the
door
and
one
of
his
ankles
in
each
hand
:
<EOS>
resuming
the
attitude
(
except
that
it
was
now
expressive
of
unwinking
watchfulness
)
in
which
he
had
sat
before
the
same
man
in
the
deeper
shade
of
another
prison
,
one
hot
morning
at
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
on
the
witnessing
of
these
two
madmen
,
"
said
Monsieur
Blandois
,
otherwise
Lagnier
,
otherwise
Rigaud
,
"
that
you
want
me
,
brother
-
bird
.
 
<EOS>
Here
I
am
!
"
<EOS>
Glancing
round
contemptuously
at
the
bedstead
,
which
was
turned
up
by
day
,
he
leaned
his
back
against
it
as
a
resting
-
place
,
without
removing
his
hat
from
his
head
,
and
stood
defiantly
lounging
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
villain
of
ill
-
omen
!
"
said
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
purposely
cast
a
dreadful
suspicion
upon
my
mother
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
Why
have
you
done
it
?
   
<EOS>
What
prompted
you
to
the
devilish
invention
?
"
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
Rigaud
,
after
frowning
at
him
for
a
moment
,
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
Hear
this
noble
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
Listen
,
all
the
world
,
to
this
creature
of
Virtue
!
 
<EOS>
But
take
care
,
take
care
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
possible
,
my
friend
,
that
your
ardour
is
a
little
compromising
.
 
<EOS>
Holy
Blue
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
possible
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Signore
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Cavalletto
,
also
addressing
Arthur
:
"
for
to
commence
,
hear
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
received
your
instructions
to
find
him
,
Rigaud
;
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
truth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
go
,
consequentementally
,
"
---
it
would
have
given
Mrs
Plornish
great
concern
if
she
could
have
been
persuaded
that
his
occasional
lengthening
of
an
adverb
in
this
way
,
was
the
chief
fault
of
his
English
,
---
"
first
among
my
countrymen
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
them
what
news
in
Londra
,
of
foreigners
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
go
among
the
French
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
go
among
the
Germans
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
part
of
us
know
well
<EOS>
the
other
,
and
they
all
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
!
<EOS>
---
no
person
can
tell
me
nothing
of
him
,
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
Fifteen
times
,
"
said
Cavalletto
,
thrice
throwing
out
his
left
hand
with
all
its
fingers
spread
,
and
doing
it
so
rapidly
that
the
sense
of
sight
could
hardly
follow
the
action
,
"
I
ask
of
him
in
every
place
where
go
the
foreigners
;
and
fifteen
times
,
"
repeating
the
same
swift
performance
,
"
they
know
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
!
---
"
At
this
significant
Italian
rest
on
the
word
"
But
,
"
his
backhanded
shake
of
his
right
forefinger
came
into
play
;
a
very
little
,
and
very
cautiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
After
a
long
time
when
I
have
not
been
able
to
find
that
he
is
here
in
Londra
,
some
one
tells
me
of
a
soldier
with
white
hair
---
hey
?
---
not
hair
like
this
that
he
carries
---
white
---
who
lives
retired
secrettementally
,
in
a
certain
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
!
---
"
with
another
rest
upon
the
word
,
"
who
sometimes
in
the
after
-
dinner
,
walks
,
and
smokes
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
necessary
,
as
they
say
in
Italy
(
and
as
they
know
,
poor
people
)
,
to
have
patience
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
patience
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
where
is
this
certain
place
.
 
<EOS>
One
.
 
<EOS>
believes
it
is
here
<EOS>
,
one
believes
it
is
there
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
well
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
here
,
it
is
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
wait
patientissamentally
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
watch
;
then
I
hide
,
until
he
walks
and
smokes
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
soldier
with
grey
hair
---
<EOS>
But
!
---
"
a
very
decided
rest
indeed
,
and
a
very
vigorous
play
from
side
to
side
of
the
back
-
handed
forefinger
---
"
he
is
also
this
man
that
you
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
noticeable
,
that
,
in
his
old
habit
of
submission
to
one
who
had
been
at
the
trouble
of
asserting
superiority
over
him
,
he
even
then
bestowed
upon
Rigaud
a
confused
bend
of
his
head
,
after
thus
pointing
him
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
well
,
Signore
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
in
conclusion
,
addressing
Arthur
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
waited
for
a
good
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
I
writed
some
words
to
Signor
Panco
,
"
an
air
of
novelty
came
over
Mr
Pancks
with
this
designation
,
"
to
come
and
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
showed
him
,
Rigaud
,
at
his
window
,
to
Signor
Panco
,
who
was
often
the
spy
in
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
slept
at
night
near
the
door
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
we
entered
,
<EOS>
only
this
to
-
day
,
and
now
you
see
him
!
 
<EOS>
As
he
would
not
come
up
in
presence
of
the
illustrious
Advocate
,
"
such
was
Mr
Baptist
's
honourable
mention
of
Mr
Rugg
,
"
we
waited
down
below
there
,
together
,
and
Signor
Panco
guarded
the
street
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
this
recital
,
Arthur
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
impudent
and
wicked
face
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
met
his
,
the
nose
came
down
over
the
moustache
and
the
moustache
went
up
under
the
nose
.
 
<EOS>
When
nose
and
moustache
had
settled
into
their
places
again
,
Monsieur
Rigaud
loudly
snapped
his
fingers
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
;
bending
forward
to
jerk
the
snaps
at
Arthur
,
as
if
they
were
palpable
missiles
which
he
jerked
into
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Philosopher
!
"
said
Rigaud
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
,
"
returned
Arthur
,
without
disguising
his
abhorrence
,
"
<EOS>
how
you
dare
direct
a
suspicion
of
murder
against
my
mother
's
house
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dare
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ho
,
ho
!
 
<EOS>
Hear
him
!
 
<EOS>
Dare
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
dare
?
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
my
small
boy
,
but
you
are
a
little
imprudent
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
that
suspicion
to
be
cleared
away
,
"
said
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
taken
there
,
and
be
publicly
seen
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
<EOS>
,
moreover
,
what
business
you
had
there
when
I
had
a
burning
desire
to
fling
you
down
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
frown
at
me
,
man
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
enough
of
you
to
know
that
you
are
a
bully
and
coward
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
no
revival
of
my
spirits
from
the
effects
of
this
wretched
place
to
tell
you
so
plain
a
fact
,
and
one
that
you
know
<EOS>
so
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
White
to
the
lips
<EOS>
,
Rigaud
stroked
his
moustache
,
muttering
,
"
By
Heaven
,
my
small
boy
,
but
you
are
a
little
compromising
of
my
lady
,
your
respectable
mother
"
---
and
seemed
for
a
minute
undecided
how
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
His
indecision
was
soon
gone
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
himself
down
with
a
threatening
swagger
,
and
said
:
   
"
Give
me
a
bottle
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
buy
wine
here
.
 
<EOS>
Send
one
of
your
madmen
to
get
me
a
bottle
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
talk
to
you
without
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
or
no
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Fetch
him
what
he
wants
,
Cavalletto
,
"
said
Arthur
,
scornfully
,
producing
the
money
.
   
<EOS>
"
Contraband
beast
,
"
added
Rigaud
,
"
bring
Port
wine
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
drink
nothing
but
Porto
-
Porto
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
contraband
beast
,
however
,
assuring
all
present
,
with
his
significant
finger
,
that
he
peremptorily
declined
to
leave
his
post
at
the
door
,
Signor
Panco
offered
his
services
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
returned
with
the
bottle
of
wine
:
which
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
place
,
originating
in
a
scarcity
of
corkscrews
among
the
Collegians
(
in
common
with
a
scarcity
of
much
else
)
,
was
already
opened
for
use
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madman
!
 
<EOS>
A
large
glass
,
"
said
Rigaud
.
   
<EOS>
Signor
Panco
put
a
tumbler
before
him
;
not
without
a
visible
conflict
of
feeling
on
the
question
of
throwing
it
at
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Haha
!
"
boasted
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Once
a
gentleman
,
and
always
a
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
A
gentleman
from
the
beginning
,
and
a
gentleman
to
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
Devil
!
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
must
be
waited
on
,
I
hope
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
part
of
my
character
to
be
waited
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
half
filled
the
tumbler
as
he
said
it
,
and
drank
off
the
contents
when
he
had
done
saying
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
<EOS>
"
smacking
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
very
old
prisoner
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
judge
by
your
looks
,
brave
sir
,
that
imprisonment
will
subdue
your
blood
much
sooner
than
it
softens
this
hot
wine
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
mellowing
---
losing
body
and
colour
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
salute
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
tossed
off
another
half
glass
:
holding
it
up
both
before
and
afterwards
,
so
as
to
display
his
small
,
white
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
business
,
"
he
then
continued
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
shown
yourself
more
free
of
speech
than
body
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
used
the
freedom
of
telling
you
what
you
know
yourself
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
yourself
,
as
we
all
know
you
,
to
be
far
worse
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Add
,
always
a
gentleman
,
and
it
's
no
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Except
in
that
regard
,
we
are
all
alike
.
 
<EOS>
For
example
:
you
could
n't
for
your
life
be
a
gentleman
;
I
could
n't
for
my
life
be
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
How
great
the
difference
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
Words
,
sir
,
never
influence
the
course
of
the
cards
,
or
the
course
of
the
dice
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
?
 
<EOS>
You
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
also
play
a
game
,
and
words
are
without
power
over
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
that
he
was
confronted
with
Cavalletto
,
and
knew
that
his
story
was
known
---
whatever
thin
disguise
he
had
worn
,
he
dropped
;
and
faced
it
out
,
with
a
bare
face
,
as
the
infamous
wretch
he
was

<EOS>
"
No
,
my
son
<EOS>
,
"
he
resumed
,
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
play
my
game
to
the
end
in
spite
of
words
;
and
Death
of
my
Body
and
Death
of
my
Soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
win
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
want
to
know
why
I
played
this
little
trick
that
you
have
interrupted
?
 
<EOS>
Know
then
that
I
had
,
and
that
I
have
<EOS>
---
do
you
understand
me
?
 
<EOS>
have
---
a
commodity
to
sell
to
my
lady
your
respectable
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
described
my
precious
commodity
,
and
fixed
my
price
.
 
<EOS>
Touching
the
bargain
,
your
admirable
mother
was
a
little
too
calm
,
too
stolid
,
too
immovable
and
statue
-
like
.
<EOS>
In
fine
,
your
admirable
mother
vexed
me
.
 
<EOS>
To
make
variety
in
my
position
,
and
to
amuse
myself
---
what
!
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
must
be
amused
at
somebody
's
expense
!
<EOS>
---
I
conceived
the
happy
idea
of
disappearing
.
<EOS>
An
idea
,
see
you
,
that
your
characteristic
mother
and
my
Flintwinch
would
have
been
well
enough
pleased
to
execute
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Bah
,
bah
,
bah
,
do
n't
look
as
from
high
to
low
at
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
enough
pleased
,
excessively
enchanted
,
and
with
all
their
hearts
ravished
.
 
<EOS>
How
strongly
will
you
have
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
threw
out
the
lees
of
his
glass
on
the
ground
,
so
that
they
nearly
spattered
Cavalletto
.
 
<EOS>
This
seemed
to
draw
his
attention
to
him
anew
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
down
his
glass
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
fill
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
born
to
be
served
.
 
<EOS>
Come
then
,
you
Cavalletto
,
and
fill
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
little
man
looked
at
Clennam
,
whose
eyes
were
occupied
with
Rigaud
,
and
,
seeing
no
prohibition
,
got
up
from
the
ground
,
and
poured
out
from
the
bottle
into
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
The
blending
,
as
he
did
so
,
of
his
old
submission
with
a
sense
of
something
humorous
;
the
striving
of
that
with
a
certain
smouldering
ferocity
,
which
might
have
flashed
fire
in
an
instant
(
as
the
born
gentleman
seemed
to
think
,
for
he
had
a
wary
eye
upon
him
)
;
and
the
easy
yielding
of
all
to
a
good
-
natured
,
careless
,
predominant
propensity
to
sit
down
on
the
ground
again
:
formed
a
very
remarkable
combination
of
character
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
happy
idea
,
brave
sir
,
"
Rigaud
resumed
after
drinking
,
"
was
a
happy
idea
for
several
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
It
amused
me
,
it
worried
your
dear
mama
and
my
Flintwinch
<EOS>
,
it
caused
you
agonies
(
my
terms
for
a
lesson
in
politeness
towards
a
gentleman
)
,
and
it
suggested
to
all
the
amiable
persons
interested
that
your
entirely
devoted
is
a
man
to
fear
.
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
he
is
a
man
to
fear
!
 
<EOS>
Beyond
this
;
it
might
have
restored
her
wit
to
my
lady
your
mother
---
might
,
under
the
pressing
little
suspicion
your
wisdom
has
recognised
,
have
persuaded
her
at
last
to
announce
,
covertly
,
in
the
journals
,
that
the
difficulties
of
a
certain
contract
would
be
removed
by
the
appearance
of
a
certain
important
party
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
yes
,
perhaps
no
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
,
you
have
interrupted
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
what
is
it
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Never
had
Clennam
felt
more
acutely
that
he
was
a
prisoner
in
bonds
,
than
when
he
saw
this
man
before
him
,
and
could
not
accompany
him
to
his
mother
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
undiscernible
difficulties
and
dangers
he
had
ever
feared
were
closing
in
,
when
he
could
not
stir
hand
or
foot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
my
friend
,
philosopher
,
man
of
virtue
,
Imbecile
,
what
you
will
;
perhaps
,
"
said
Rigaud
,
pausing
in
his
drink
to
look
out
of
his
glass
with
his
horrible
smile
,
"
you
would
have
done
better
to
leave
me
alone
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
At
least
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
you
are
known
to
be
alive
and
unharmed
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
you
can
not
escape
from
these
two
witnesses
;
and
they
can
produce
you
before
any
public
authorities
,
or
before
hundreds
of
people
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
will
not
produce
me
before
one
,
"
said
Rigaud
,
snapping
his
fingers
again
with
an
air
of
triumphant
menace
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
Devil
with
your
witnesses
!

To
the
Devil

your
produced

Do
I
know

me

"
   
<EOS>
Cavalletto
got
up
again
as
before
,
and
laid
them
before
him
in
his
former
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Rigaud
,
after
some
villainous
thinking
and
smiling
,
wrote
,
and
read
aloud
,
as
follows
:

"
<EOS>
Dear
Madam
,
---
I
am
in
despair
to
be
informed
to
-
day
by
our
prisoner
here
(
who
has
had
the
goodness
to
employ
spies
to
seek
me
,
living
for
politic
reasons
in
retirement
)
,
that
you
have
had
fears
for
my
safety
.
   
<EOS>
"
Reassure
yourself
,
dear
madam
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
well
<EOS>
,
I
am
strong
and
constant
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
greatest
impatience
I
should
fly
to
your
house
,
but
that
I
foresee
it
to
be
possible
,
under
the
circumstances
,
that
you
will
not
yet
have
quite
definitively
arranged
the
little
proposition
I
have
had
the
honour
to
submit
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
name
one
week
from
this
day
,
for
a
last
final
visit
on
my
part
;
when
you
will
unconditionally
accept
it
or
reject
it
,
with
its
train
of
consequences
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppress
my
ardour
to
embrace
you
and
achieve
this
interesting
business
,
in
order
that
you
may
have
leisure
to
adjust
its
details
to
our
perfect
mutual
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
meanwhile
,
it
is
not
too
much
to
propose
(
our
prisoner
having
deranged
my
housekeeping
)
,
that
my
expenses
of
lodging
and
nourishment
at
an
hotel
shall
be
paid
by
you
.
"
<EOS>
Receive
,
dear
madam
,
the
assurance
of
my
highest
and
most
distinguished
consideration

RIGAUD

<EOS>
"
A
thousand

to
that
dear
Flintwinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
kiss
the
hands
of
Madame
F.
"
   
When
he
had
finished
this
epistle
,
Rigaud
folded
it
and
tossed
it
with
a
flourish
at
Clennam
's
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hola
you
!
 
<EOS>
Apropos
of
producing
,
let
somebody
produce
that
at
its
address
,
and
produce
the
answer
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cavalletto
,
"
said
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
this
fellow
's
letter
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
Cavalletto
's
significant
finger
again
expressing
that
his
post
was
at
the
door
to
keep
watch
over
Rigaud
,
now
he
had
found
him
with
so
much
trouble
,
and
that
the
duty
of
his
post
was
to
sit
on
the
floor
backed
up
by
the
door
,
looking
at
Rigaud
and
holding
his
own
ankles
,
---
Signor
Panco
once
more
volunteered
.
 
<EOS>
His
services
being
accepted
,
Cavalletto
suffered
the
door
to
open
barely
wide
enough
to
admit
of
his
squeezing
himself
out
,
and
immediately
shut
it
on
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Touch
me
with
a
finger
,
touch
me
with
an
epithet
,
question
my
superiority
as
I
sit
here
drinking
my
wine
at
my
pleasure
,
"
said
Rigaud
,
"
and
I
follow
the
letter
and
cancel
my
week
's
grace
.
 
<EOS>
You
wanted
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
got
me
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
like
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
returned
Clennam
,
with
a
bitter
sense
of
his
helplessness
,
"
that
when
I
sought
you
,
I
was
not
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
Devil
with
you
and
your
prison
,
"
retorted
Rigaud
,
leisurely
,
as
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
case
containing
the
materials
for
making
cigarettes
,
and
employed
his
facile
hands
in
folding
a
few
for
present
use
;
"
I
care
for
neither
of
you
.
<EOS>
Contrabandist
!
 
<EOS>
A
light
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Cavalletto
got
up
,
and
gave
him
what
he
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
something
dreadful
in
the
noiseless
skill
of
his
cold
,
white
hands
,
with
the
fingers
lithely
twisting
about
and
twining
one
over
another
like
serpents
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
could
not
prevent
himself
from
shuddering
inwardly
,
as
if
he
had
been
looking
on
at
a
nest
of
those
creatures
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hola
,
Pig
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rigaud
,
with
a
noisy
stimulating
cry
,
as
if
Cavalletto
were
an
Italian
horse
or
mule
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
The
infernal
old
jail
was
a
respectable
one
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
dignity
in
the
bars
and
stones
of
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
prison
for
men
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
?
<EOS>
Bah
!
 
<EOS>
A
hospital
for
imbeciles
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
smoked
his
cigarette
out
,
with
his
ugly
smile
so
fixed
upon
his
face
that
he
looked
as
though
he
were
smoking
with
his
drooping
beak
of
a
nose
,
rather
than
with
his
mouth
;
like
a
fancy
in
a
weird
picture
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
lighted
a
second
cigarette
at
the
still
burning
end
of
the
first
,
he
said
to
Clennam
:
   
<EOS>
"
One
must
pass
the
time
in
the
madman
's
absence
.
 
<EOS>
One
must
talk
.
<EOS>
One
ca
n't
drink
strong
wine
all
day
long
,
or
I
would
have
another
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
handsome
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Though
not
exactly
to
my
taste
,
still
,
by
the
Thunder
and
the
Lightning
!
 
<EOS>
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
I
felicitate
you
on
your
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
neither
know
nor
ask
,
"
said
Clennam
,
"
of
whom
you
speak
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Della
bella
Gowana
,
sir
,
as
they
say
in
Italy
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
Gowan
,
the
fair
Gowan
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
whose
husband
you
were

---
follower
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
Follower
?
 
<EOS>
You

insolent
.
 
<EOS>
The
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
sell
all
your
friends
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rigaud
took
his
cigarette
from
his
mouth
,
and
eyed
him
with
a
momentary
revelation
of
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
put
it
between
his
lips
again
,
as
he
answered
with
coolness
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
sell
anything
that
commands
a
price
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
your
lawyers
live
,
your
politicians
,
your
intriguers
,
your
men
of
the
Exchange
?
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
live

<EOS>
How
do
you
come
here
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
sold
no
friend
?
 
<EOS>
Lady
of
mine
!
 
<EOS>
I
rather
think
,
yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
turned
away
from
him
towards
the
window
,
and
sat
looking
out
at
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
Effectively
,
sir
,
"
said
Rigaud
,
"
Society
sells
itself
and
sells
me
:
and
I
sell
Society

<EOS>
I
perceive
you
have
acquaintance
with
another
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Also
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
A
strong
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
see
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
they
call
her
?
 
<EOS>
Wade
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
received
no
answer
,
but
could
easily
discern
that
he
had
hit
the
mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
that
handsome
lady
and
strong
spirit
addresses
me
in
the
street
,
and
I
am
not
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
I
respond
.
 
<EOS>
That
handsome
lady
and
strong
spirit
does
me
the
favour
to
remark
,
in
full
confidence
,
"
I
have
my
curiosity
,
and
I
have
my
chagrins
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
more
than
ordinarily
honourable
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
I
announce
myself
,
"
Madame
,
a
gentleman
from
the
birth
,
and
a
gentleman
to
the
death
;
but
NOT
more
than
ordinarily
honourable
.
 
<EOS>
I
despise
such
a
weak
fantasy
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
she
is
pleased
to
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
difference
between
you
and
the
rest
is
,
"
she
answers
,
"
that
you
say
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
For
she
knows
Society
.
 
<EOS>
I
accept
her
congratulations
with
gallantry
and
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
Politeness
and
little
gallantries
are
inseparable
from
my
character
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
makes
a
proposition
,
which
is
,
in
effect
,
that
she
has
seen
us
much
together
;
that
it
appears
to
her
that
I
am
for
the
passing
time
the
cat
of
the
house
,
the
friend
of
the
family
;
that
her
curiosity
and
her
chagrins
awaken
the
fancy
to
be
acquainted
with
their
movements
,
to
know
the
manner
of
their
life
,
how
the
fair
Gowana
is
beloved
,
how
the
fair
Gowana
is
cherished
,
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
not
rich
,
but
offers
such
and
such
little
recompenses
for
the
little
cares
and
derangements
of
such
services
;
and
I
graciously
---
to
do
everything
<EOS>
graciously
is
a
part
of
my
character
---
consent
to

O
yes

So

<EOS>
Though
Clennam
's
back
was
turned
while
he
spoke
,
and
thenceforth
to
the
end
of
the
interview
,
he
kept
those
glittering
eyes
of
his
that
were
too
near
together
,
upon
him
,
and
evidently
saw
in
the
very
carriage
of
the
head
,
as
he
passed
with
his
braggart
recklessness
from
clause
to
clause
of
what
he
said
,
that
he
was
saying
nothing
which
Clennam
did
not
already
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whoof
!
 
<EOS>
The
fair
Gowana
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
lighting
a
third
cigarette
with
a
sound
as
if
his
lightest
breath
could
blow
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charming
,
but
imprudent
!
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
not
well
of
the
fair
Gowana
to
make
mysteries
of
letters
from
old
lovers
,
in
her
bedchamber
on
the
mountain
,
that
her
husband
might
not
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
Whoof
!
 
<EOS>
The
Gowana
was
mistaken
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
earnestly
hope
,
"
cried
Arthur
aloud
,
"
that
Pancks
may
not
be
long
gone
,
for
this
man
's
presence
pollutes
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
'll
flourish
here
,
and
everywhere

"
said
Rigaud
,
with
an
exulting
look
and
snap
of
his
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
always
has
;
he
always
will
!
"
 
<EOS>
Stretching
his
body
out
on
the
only
three
chairs
in
the
room
besides
that
on
which
Clennam
sat
,
he
sang
,
smiting
himself
on
the
breast
as
the
gallant
personage
of
the
song
.

<EOS>
Partly
in
his
old
habit
of
submission
,
partly
because
his
not
doing
it
might
injure
his
benefactor
,
and
partly
because
he
would
as
soon
do
it
as
anything
else
,
Cavalletto
took
up
the
Refrain
this
time
.
<EOS>
Rigaud
laughed
,
and
fell
to
smoking
with
his
eyes
shut
.
   
<EOS>
Possibly
another
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
Mr
Pancks
's
step
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
,
but
<EOS>
the
interval
seemed
to
Clennam
insupportably
long
.
 
<EOS>
His
step
was
attended
by
another
step
;
and
when
Cavalletto
opened
the
door
,
he
admitted
Mr
Pancks
and
Mr
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
was
no
sooner
visible
,
than
Rigaud
rushed
at
him
and
embraced
him
boisterously
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
find
yourself
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
as
soon
as
he
could
disengage
himself
,
which
he
struggled
to
do
with
very
little
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
no
<EOS>
;
I
do
n't
want
any
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
in
reference
to
another
menace
of
attention
from
his
recovered
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
what
I
said
to
you
about
sleeping
dogs
and
missing
ones
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
come
true
,
you
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
as
imperturbable
as
ever
,
to
all
appearance
,
and
nodded
his
head
in
a
moralising
way
as
he
looked
round
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
this
is
the
Marshalsea
prison
for
debt

"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
"
<EOS>
Hah
!
 
<EOS>
you
have
brought
your
pigs
to
a
very
indifferent
market
,
Arthur

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
If
Arthur
had
patience
,
Rigaud
had
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
his
little
Flintwinch
,
with
fierce
playfulness
,
by
the
two
lapels
of
his
coat
,
and
cried
:
   
"
To
the
Devil

the
Pigs

and

Now

<EOS>
Give
me
the
answer
to
my

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
let
go
a
moment
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Flintwinch
,
"
<EOS>
I
'll
first
hand
Mr
Arthur
<EOS>
a
little
note
that
I
have
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
his
mother
's
maimed
writing
,
on
a
slip
of
paper
,
and
contained
only
these
words
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
is
enough
that
you
have
ruined
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Rest
contented
without
more
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Flintwinch
is
my
messenger
and
representative
.
 
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
MC
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
read
this
twice
,
in
silence
,
and
then
tore
it
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Rigaud
in
the
meanwhile
stepped
into
a
chair
,
and
sat
himself
on
the
back
with
his
feet
upon
the
seat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Beau
Flintwinch
,
"
he
said
,
when
he
had
closely
watched
the
note
to
its
destruction
,
"
the
answer
to
my
letter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Clennam
did
not
write
,
Mr
Blandois
,
her
hands
being
cramped
,
and
she
thinking
it
as
well
to
send
it
verbally
by
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
screwed
this
out
of
himself
,
unwillingly
and
rustily
.
"
<EOS>
She
sends
her
compliments
,
and
says
she
does
n't
on
the
whole
wish
to
term
you
unreasonable
,
and
that
she
agrees
.
 
<EOS>
But
without
prejudicing
the
appointment
that
stands
for
this
day
week
.
"
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
Rigaud
,
after
indulging
in
a
fit
of
laughter
,
descended
from
his
throne
,
saying
,
"
Good
!
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
seek
an
hotel
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
there
his
eyes
encountered
Cavalletto
,
who
was
still
at
his
post
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Pig
,
"
he
added
,
"
I
have
had
you
for
a
follower
against
my
will
;
now
,
I
'll
have
you
against
yours
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
my
little
reptiles
<EOS>
,
I
am
born
to
be
served
.
 
<EOS>
I
demand
the
service
of
this
contrabandist
as
my
domestic
until
this
day
week
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
In
answer
to
Cavalletto
's
look
of
inquiry
,
Clennam
made
him
a
sign
to
go
;
but
he
added
aloud
,
"
unless
you
are
afraid
of
him
.
"
<EOS>
Cavalletto
replied
with
a
very
emphatic
finger
-
negative
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
master
,
I
am
not
afraid
of
him
,
when
I
no
more
keep
it
secrettementally
that
he
was
once
my
comrade
.
"
 
<EOS>
Rigaud
took
no
notice
of
either
remark
until
he
had
lighted
his
last
cigarette
and
was
quite
ready
for
walking
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Afraid
of
him
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
then
,
looking
round
upon
them
all
.
"
<EOS>
Whoof
!
 
<EOS>
My
children
,
my
babies
,
my
little
dolls
,
you
are
all
afraid
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
give
him
his
bottle
of
wine
here
;
you
give
him
meat
,
drink
,
and
lodging
there
;
you
dare
not
touch
him
with
a
finger
or
an
epithet
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
his
character
to
triumph
!
 
<EOS>
Whoof
!
   
<EOS>
"
Of
all
the
king
's
knights
he
's
the
flower
,
And
he
's
always
gay
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
adaptation
of
the
Refrain
to
himself
,
he
stalked
out
of
the
room
closely
followed
by
Cavalletto
,
whom
perhaps
he
had
pressed
into
his
service
because
he
tolerably
well
knew
it
would
not
be
easy
to
get
rid
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
after
scraping
his
chin
,
and
looking
about
with
caustic
disparagement
of
the
Pig
-
Market
,
nodded
to
Arthur
,
and
followed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
still
penitent
and
depressed
,
followed
too
;
after
receiving
with
great
attention
a
secret
word
or
two
of
instructions
from
Arthur
,
and
whispering
back
that
he
would
see
this
affair
out
,
and
stand
by
it
to
the
end
.
   
<EOS>
The
prisoner
,
with
the
feeling
that
he
was
more
despised
,
more
scorned
and
repudiated
,
more
helpless
,
altogether
more
miserable
and
fallen
than
before
,
was
left
alone
again
.

Chapter
29
.
<EOS>
A
Plea
in
the
Marshalsea
 
<EOS>
Haggard
anxiety
and
remorse
are
bad
companions
to
be
barred
up
with
.
 
<EOS>
Brooding
all
day
,
and
resting
very
little
indeed
at
night
,
will
not
arm
a
man
against
misery
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
Clennam
felt
that
his
health
was
sinking
,
as
his
spirits
had
already
sunk
and
that
the
weight
under
which
he
bent
was
bearing
him
down
.
   
<EOS>
Night
after
night
he
had
risen
from
his
bed
of
wretchedness
at
twelve
or
one
o'clock
,
and
had
sat
at
his
window
watching
the
sickly
lamps
in
the
yard
,
and
looking
upward
for
the
first
wan
trace
of
day
,
hours
before
it
was
possible
that
the
sky
could
show
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Now
when
the
night
came
,
he
could
not
even
persuade
himself
to
undress
.
   
<EOS>
For
a
burning
restlessness
set
in
,
an
agonised
impatience
of
the
prison
,
and
a
conviction
that
he
was
going
to
break
his
heart
and
die
there
,
which
caused
him
indescribable
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
His
dread
and
hatred
of
the
place
became
so
intense
that
he
felt
it
a
labour
to
draw
his
breath
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
sensation
of
being
stifled
sometimes
so
overpowered
him
,
that
he
would
stand
at
the
window
holding
his
throat
and
gasping
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
a
longing
for
other
air
,
and
a
yearning
to
be
beyond
the
blind
blank
wall
,
made
him
feel
as
if
he
must
go
mad
with
the
ardour
of
the
desire
.
   
<EOS>
Many
other
prisoners
had
had
experience
of
this
condition
before
him
,
and
its
violence
and
continuity
had
worn
themselves
out
in
their
cases
,
as
they
did
in
his
.
 
<EOS>
Two
nights
and
a
day
exhausted
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
back
by
fits
,
but
those
grew
fainter
and
returned
at
lengthening
intervals
.
 
<EOS>
A
desolate
calm
succeeded
;
and
the
middle
of
the
week
found
him
settled
down
in
the
despondency
of
low
,
slow
fever
.
   
<EOS>
With
Cavalletto
and
Pancks
<EOS>
away
,
he
had
no
visitors
to
fear
<EOS>
but
Mr
and
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
His
anxiety
,
in
reference
to
that
worthy
pair
,
was
that
they
should
not
come
near
him
;
for
,
in
the
morbid
state
of
his
nerves
,
he
sought
to
be
left
alone
,
and
spared
the
being
seen
so
subdued
and
weak
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrote
a
note
to
Mrs
Plornish
representing
himself
as
occupied
with
his
affairs
,
and
bound
by
the
necessity
of
devoting
himself
to
them
,
to
remain
for
a
time
even
without
the
pleasant
interruption
of
a
sight
of
her
kind
face
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Young
John
,
who
looked
in
daily
at
a
certain
hour
,
when
the
turnkeys
were
relieved
,
to
ask
if
he
could
do
anything
for
him
;
he
always
made
a
pretence
of
being
engaged
in
writing
,
and
to
answer
cheerfully
in
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
The
subject
of
their
only
long
conversation
had
never
been
revived
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Through
all
these
changes
of
unhappiness
,
however
,
it
had
never
lost
its
hold
on
Clennam
's
mind
.
   
<EOS>
The
sixth
day
of
the
appointed
week
was
a
moist
,
hot
,
misty
day
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
the
prison
's
poverty
,
and
shabbiness
,
and
dirt
,
were
growing
in
the
sultry
atmosphere
.
 
<EOS>
With
an
aching
head
and
a
weary
heart
,
Clennam
had
watched
the
miserable
night
out
,
listening
to
the
fall
of
rain
on
the
yard
pavement
,
thinking
of
its
softer
fall
upon
the
country
earth
.
 
<EOS>
A
blurred
circle
of
yellow
haze
had
risen
up
in
the
sky
in
lieu
of
sun
,
and
he
had
watched
the
patch
it
put
upon
his
wall
,
like
a
bit
of
the
prison
's
raggedness
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
heard
the
gates
open
;
and
the
badly
shod
feet
that
waited
outside
shuffle
in
;
and
the
sweeping
,
and
pumping
,
and
moving
about
,
begin
,
which
commenced
the
prison
morning
.
 
<EOS>
So
ill
and
faint
that
he
was
obliged
to
rest
many
times
in
the
process
of
getting
himself
washed
,
he
had
at
length
crept
to
his
chair
by
the
open
window
.
 
<EOS>
In
it
he
sat
dozing
,
while
the
old
woman
who
arranged
his
room
went
through
her
morning
's
work
.
   
<EOS>
Light
of
head
with
want
of
sleep
and
want
of
food
(
his
appetite
,
and
even
his
sense
of
taste
,
having
forsaken
him
)
<EOS>
,
he
had
been
two
or
three
times
conscious
,
in
the
night
,
of
going
astray
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
heard
fragments
of
tunes
and
songs
in
the
warm
wind
,
which
he
knew
had
no
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
he
began
to
doze
in
exhaustion
,
he
heard
them
again
;
and
voices
seemed
to
address
him
,
and
he
answered
,
and
started
.
   
<EOS>
Dozing
and
dreaming
,
without
the
power
of
reckoning
time
,
so
that
a
minute
might
have
been
an
hour
and
an
hour
<EOS>
a
minute
,
some
abiding
impression
of
a
garden
stole
over
him
---
a
garden
of
flowers
,
with
a
damp
warm
wind
gently
stirring
their
scents
.
 
<EOS>
It
required
such
a
painful
effort
to
lift
his
head
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
into
this
,
or
inquiring
into
anything
,
that
the
impression
appeared
to
have
become
quite
an
old
and
importunate
one
when
he
looked
round
.
<EOS>
Beside
the
tea
-
cup
on
his
table
he
saw
,
then
,
a
blooming
nosegay
:
a
wonderful
handful
of
the
choicest
and
most
lovely
flowers
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
had
ever
appeared
so
beautiful
in
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
them
up
and
inhaled
their
fragrance
,
and
he
lifted
them
to
his
hot
head
,
and
he
put
them
down
and
opened
his
parched
hands
to
them
,
as
cold
hands
are
opened
to
receive
the
cheering
of
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
had
delighted
in
them
for
some
time
,
that
he
wondered
who
had
sent
them
;
and
opened
his
door
to
ask
the
woman
who
must
have
put
them
there
,
how
they
had
come
into
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
gone
,
and
seemed
to
have
been
long
gone
;
for
the
tea
she
had
left
for
him
on
the
table
was
cold
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
drink
some
,
but
could
not
bear
the
odour
of
it
:
so
he
crept
back
to
his
chair
by
the
open
window
,
and
put
the
flowers
on
the
little
round
table
of
old
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
first
faintness
consequent
on
having
moved
about
had
left
him
,
he
subsided
into
his
former
state
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
night
-
tunes
was
playing
in
the
wind
,
when
the
door
of
his
room
seemed
to
open
to
a
light
touch
,
and
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
a
quiet
figure
seemed
to
stand
there
,
with
a
black
mantle
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
draw
the
mantle
off
and
drop
it
on
the
ground
,
and
then
it
seemed
to
be
his
Little
Dorrit
in
her
old
,
worn
dress
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
tremble
,
and
to
clasp
its
hands
,
and
to
smile
,
and
to
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
He
roused
himself
,
and
cried
out
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
saw
,
in
the
loving
,
pitying
,
sorrowing
,
<EOS>
dear
face
,
as
in
a
mirror
,
how
changed
he
was
;
and
she
came
towards
him
;
and
with
her
hands
laid
on
his
breast
to
keep
him
in
his
chair
,
and
with
her
knees
upon
the
floor
at
his
feet
,
and
with
her
lips
raised
up
to
kiss
him
,
and
with
her
tears
dropping
on
him
as
the
rain
from
Heaven
had
dropped
upon
the
flowers
,
Little
Dorrit
,
a
living
presence
,
called
him
by
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
my
best
friend
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Clennam
,
do
n't
let
me
see
you
weep
!
<EOS>
Unless
you
weep
with
pleasure
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
Your
own
poor
child
come
back
!
"
<EOS>
So
faithful
,
tender
,
and
unspoiled
by
Fortune
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
in
the
light
of
her
eyes
,
in
the
touch
of
her
hands
,
so
Angelically
comforting
and
true
!
   
<EOS>
As
he
embraced
her
,
she
said
to
him
,
"
They
never
told
me
you
were
ill
,
"
and
drawing
an
arm
softly
round
his
neck
,
laid
his
head
upon
her
bosom
,
put
a
hand
upon
his
head
,
and
resting
her
cheek
upon
that
hand
,
nursed
him
as
lovingly
,
and
GOD
knows
as
innocently
,
as
she
had
nursed
her
father
in
that
room
when
she
had
been
but
<EOS>
a
baby
,
needing
all
the
care
from
others
that
she
took
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
could
speak
,
he
said
,
"
Is
it
possible
that
you
have
come
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
And
in
this
dress
?
"
   
"
I
hoped
you
would
like
me
better
in
this
dress
than
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
kept
it
by
me
,
to
remind
me
:
though
I
wanted
no
reminding
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
alone
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
brought
an
old
friend
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Looking
round
,
he
saw
Maggy
in
her
big
cap
which
had
been
long
abandoned
,
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
as
in
the
bygone
days
,
chuckling
rapturously
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
yesterday
evening
that
I
came
to
London
with
my
brother
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
round
to
Mrs
Plornish
almost
as
soon
as
we
arrived
,
that
I
might
hear
of
you
and
let
you
know
I
had
come
.
<EOS>
Then
I
heard
that
you
were
here
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
happen
to
think
of
me
in
the
night
?
 
<EOS>
I
almost
believe
you
must
have
thought
of
me
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
you
so
anxiously
,
and
it
appeared
so
long
to
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
of
you
---
"
he
hesitated
what
to
call
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
perceived
it
in
an
instant
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
spoken
to
me
by
my
right
name
yet
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
my
right
name
always
is
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
of
you
,
Little
Dorrit
,
every
day
,
every
hour
,
every
minute
,
since
I
have
been
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
saw
the
bright
delight
of
her
face
,
and
the
flush
that
kindled
in
it
,
with
a
feeling
of
shame
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
a
broken
,
bankrupt
,
sick
,
dishonoured
prisoner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
here
before
the
gates
were
opened
,
but
I
was
afraid
to
come
straight
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
done
you
more
harm
than
good
,
at
first
;
for
the
prison
was
so
familiar
and
yet
so
strange
,
and
it
brought
back
so
many
remembrances
of
my
poor
father
,
and
of
you
too
,
that
at
first
it
overpowered
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
went
to
Mr
Chivery
before
we
came
to
the
gate
,
and
he
brought
us
in
,
and
got
john
's
room
for
us
---
my
poor
old
room
,
you
know
---
<EOS>
and
we
waited
there
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
brought
the
flowers
to
the
door
,
but
you
did
n't
hear
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
looked
something
more
womanly
than
when
she
had
gone
away
,
and
the
ripening
touch
of
the
Italian
sun
was
visible
upon
her
face
.
<EOS>
But
,
otherwise
,
she
was
quite
unchanged
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
deep
,
timid
earnestness
that
he
had
always
seen
in
her
,
and
never
without
emotion
,
he
saw
still
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
a
new
meaning
that
smote
him
to
the
heart
,
the
change
was
in
his
perception
,
not
in
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
took
off
her
old
bonnet
,
hung
it
in
the
old
place
,
and
noiselessly
began
,
with
Maggy
's
help
,
to
make
his
room
as
fresh
and
neat
as
it
could
be
made
,
and
to
sprinkle
it
with
a
pleasant
-
smelling
water
.
 
<EOS>
When
that
was
done
,
the
basket
,
which
was
filled
with
grapes
and
other
fruit
,
was
unpacked
,
and
all
its
contents
were
quietly
put
away
.
 
<EOS>
When
that
was
done
,
a
moment
's
whisper
despatched
Maggy
to
despatch
somebody
else
to
fill
the
basket
again
;
which
soon
came
back
replenished
with
new
stores
,
from
which
a
present
provision
of
cooling
drink
and
jelly
,
and
a
prospective
supply
of
roast
chicken
and
wine
and
water
,
were
the
first
extracts
.
 
<EOS>
These
various
arrangements
completed
,
she
took
out
her
old
needle
-
case
to
make
him
a
curtain
for
his
window
;
and
thus
,
with
a
quiet
reigning
in
the
room
,
that
seemed
to
diffuse
itself
through
the
else
noisy
prison
,
he
found
himself
composed
in
his
chair
,
with
Little
Dorrit
working
at
his
side
.
   
<EOS>
To
see
the
modest
head
again
bent
down
over
its
task
,
and
the
nimble
fingers
busy
at
their
old
work
---
though
she
was
not
so
absorbed
in
it
,
but
that
her
compassionate
eyes
were
often
raised
to
his
face
,
and
,
when
they
drooped
again
had
tears
in
them
---
to
be
so
consoled
and
comforted
,
and
to
believe
that
all
the
devotion
of
this
great
nature
was
turned
to
him
in
his
adversity
to
pour
out
its
inexhaustible
wealth
of
goodness
upon
him
,
did
not
steady
Clennam
's
trembling
voice
or
hand
,
or
strengthen
him
in
his
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
inspired
him
with
an
inward
fortitude
,
that
rose
with
his
love
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
dearly
he
loved
her
now
,
what
words
can
tell
!
   
<EOS>
As
they
sat
side
by
side
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
,
the
shadow
fell
like
light
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
let
him
speak
much
,
and
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
,
looking
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
Now
and
again
she
would
rise
and
give
him
the
glass
that
he
might
drink
,
or
would
smooth
the
resting
-
place
of
his
head
;
then
she
would
gently
resume
her
seat
by
him
,
and
bend
over
her
work
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
shadow
moved
with
the
sun
,
but
she
never
moved
from
his
side
,
except
to
wait
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
went
down
and
she
was
still
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
done
her
work
now
,
and
her
hand
,
faltering
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
since
its
last
tending
of
him
,
was
hesitating
there
yet
.
 
<EOS>
He
laid
his
hand
upon
it
,
and
it
clasped
him
with
a
trembling
supplication
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Clennam
,
I
must
say
something
to
you
before
I
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
it
off
from
hour
to
hour
,
but
I
must
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
too
,
dear
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
off
what
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
"
She
nervously
moved
her
hand
towards
his
lips
as
if
to
stop
him
;
then
it
dropped
,
trembling
,
into
its
former
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
abroad
again
.
 
<EOS>
My
brother
is
,
but
I
am
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
attached
to
me
,
and
he
is
so
grateful
to
me
now
---
so
much
too
grateful
,
for
it
is
only
because
I
happened
to
be
with
him
in
his
illness
---
that
he
says
I
shall
be
free
to
stay
where
I
like
best
,
and
to
do
what
I
like
best
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
wishes
me
to
be
happy
,
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
   
There
was
one
bright
star
shining
in
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
it
While
she
spoke
,
as
if
it
were
the
fervent
purpose
of
her
own
heart
shining
above
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
understand
,
I
dare
say
,
without
my
telling
you
,
that
my
brother
has
come
home
to
find
my
dear
father
's
will
,
and
to
take
possession
of
his
property
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
,
if
there
is
a
will
,
he
is
sure
i
shall
be
left
rich
;
and
if
there
is
none
,
that
he
will
make
me
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
would
have
spoken
;
but
she
put
up
her
trembling
hand
again
,
and
he
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
use
for
money
,
I
have
no
wish
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
of
no
value
at
all
to
me
but
for
your
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
rich
,
and
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
always
be
much
worse
than
poor
,
with
you
distressed
.
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
lend
you
all
I
have
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
give
it
you
?
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
show
you
that
I
have
never
forgotten
,
that
I
never
can
forget
,
your
protection
of
me
when
this
was
my
home
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Clennam
,
make
me
of
all
the
world
the
happiest
,
by
saying
Yes
.
<EOS>
Make
me
as
happy
as
I
can
be
in
leaving
you
here
,
by
saying
nothing
to
-
night
,
and
letting
me
go
away
with
the
hope
that
you
will
think
of
it
kindly
;
and
that
for
my
sake
---
not
for
yours
,
for
mine
,
for
nobody
's
but
mine
!
<EOS>
---
you
will
give
me
the
greatest
joy
I
can
experience
on
earth
,
the
joy
of
knowing
that
I
have
been
serviceable
to
you
,
and
that
I
have
paid
some
little
of
the
great
debt
of
my
affection
and
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
what
I
wish
to
say

<EOS>
I
ca
n't
visit
you
here
where
I
have
lived
so
long
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
think
of
you
here
where
I
have
seen
so
much
,
and
be
as
calm
and
comforting
as
I
ought

<EOS>
My
tears
will
make
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
keep
them
back
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
,
pray
,
pray
,
do
not
turn
from
your
Little
Dorrit
,
now
,
in
your
affliction
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
,
pray
,
I
beg
you
and
implore
you
with
all
my
grieving
heart
,
my
friend

my
dear
!

---
take
all
I
have
,
and
make
it
a
Blessing
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
star
had
shone
on
her
face
until
now
,
when
her
face
sank
upon
his
hand
and
her
own
.
   
<EOS>
It
had
grown
darker
when
he
raised
her
in
his
encircling
arm
,
and
softly
answered
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
darling
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
hear
of
such
a
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
Liberty
and
hope
would
be
so
dear
,
bought
at
such
a
price
,
that
I
could
never
support
their
weight
,
never
bear
the
reproach
of
possessing
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
what
ardent
thankfulness
and
love
I
say
this
,
I
may
call
Heaven
to
witness
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
you
will
not
let
me
be
faithful
to
you
in
your
affliction
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
,
dearest
Little
Dorrit
,
and
yet
I
will
try
to
be
faithful
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
in
the
bygone
days
when
this
was
your
home
and
when
this
was
your
dress
,
I
had
understood
myself
(
I
speak
only
of
myself
)
better
,
and
had
read
the
secrets
of
my
own
breast
more
distinctly
;
if
,
through
my
reserve
and
self
-
mistrust
,
I
had
discerned
a
light
that
I
see
brightly
now
when
it
has
passed
far
away
,
and
my
weak
footsteps
can
never
overtake
it
;
if
I
had
then
known
,
and
told
you
that
I
loved
and
honoured
you
,
not
as
the
poor
child
I
used
to
call
you
,
but
<EOS>
as
a
woman
whose
true
hand
would
raise
me
high
above
myself
and
make
me
a
far
happier
and
better
man
;
if
I
had
so
used
the
opportunity
there
is
no
recalling
---
<EOS>
as
I
wish
I
had
,
O
I
wish
I
had
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
if
something
had
kept
us
apart
then
,
when
I
was
moderately
thriving
,
and
when
you
were
poor
;
I
might
have
met
your
noble
offer
of
your
fortune
,
dearest
girl
,
with
other
words
than
these
,
and
still
have
blushed
to
touch
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
it
is
,
I
must
never
touch
it
,
never
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
besought
him
,
more
pathetically
and
earnestly
,
with
her
little
supplicatory
hand
,
than
she
could
have
done
in
any
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
disgraced
enough
,
my
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
descend
so
low
as
that
,
and
carry
you
---
<EOS>
so
dear
,
so
generous
,
so
good
---
down
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
GOD
bless
you
,
GOD
reward
you
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
past
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
took
her
in
his
arms
,
as
if
she
had
been
his
daughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Always
so
much
older
,
so
much
rougher
,
and
so
much
less
worthy
,
even
what
I
was
must
be
dismissed
by
both
of
us
,
and
you
must
see
me
only
as
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
this
parting
kiss
upon
your
cheek
,
my
child
---
who
might
have
been
more
near
to
me
,
who
never
could
have
been
more
dear
---
a
ruined
man
far
removed
from
you
,
for
ever
separated
from
you
,
whose
course
is
run
while
yours
is
but
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
courage
to
ask
to
be
forgotten
by
you
in
my
humiliation
;
but
I
ask
to
be
remembered
only
as
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
bell
began
to
ring
,
warning
visitors
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
her
mantle
from
the
wall
,
and
tenderly
wrapped
it
round
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
other
word
,
my
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
A
hard
one
to
me
,
<EOS>
but
it
is
a
necessary
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
when
you
and
this
prison
had
anything
in
common
has
long
gone
by
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
!
 
<EOS>
you
will
never
say
to
me
,
"
she
cried
,
weeping
bitterly
,
and
holding
up
her
clasped
hands
in
entreaty
,
"
that
I
am
not
to
come
back
any
more
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
surely
not
desert
me
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
say
it
,
if
I
could
;
but
I
have
not
the
courage
quite
to
shut
out
this
dear
face
,
and
abandon
all
hope
of
its
return
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
not
come
soon
,
do
not
come
often
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
now
a
tainted
place
,
and
I
well
know
the
taint
of
it
clings
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
belong
to
much
brighter
and
better
scenes
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
look
back
here
,
my
Little
Dorrit
;
you
are
to
look
away
to
very
different
and
much
happier
paths
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
GOD
bless
you
in
them
!
 
<EOS>
GOD
reward
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Maggy
,
who
had
fallen
into
very
low
spirits
,
here
cried
,
"
Oh
get
him
into
a
hospital
;
do
get
him
into
a
hospital
,
Mother
!
 
<EOS>
He
'll
never
look
like
hisself
again
,
if
he
an't
got
into
a
hospital
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
the
little
woman
as
was
always
a
spinning
at
her
wheel
,
she
can
go
to
the
cupboard
with
the
Princess
,
and
say
,
what
do
you
keep
the
Chicking
there
for
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
they
can
take
it
out
and
give
it
to
him
,
and
then
all
be
happy
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
interruption
was
seasonable
,
for
the
bell
had
nearly
rung
itself
out
.
 
<EOS>
Again
tenderly
wrapping
her
mantle
about
her
,
and
taking
her
on
his
arm
(
though
,
but
for
her
visit
,
he
was
almost
too
weak
to
walk
)
,
Arthur
led
Little
Dorrit
down
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
the
last
visitor
to
pass
out
at
the
Lodge
,
and
the
gate
jarred
heavily
and
hopelessly
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
With
the
funeral
clang
that
it
sounded
into
Arthur
's
heart
,
his
sense
of
weakness
returned
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
toilsome
journey
up
-
stairs
to
his
room
,
and
he
re
-
entered
its
dark
solitary
precincts
in
unutterable
misery
.
   
<EOS>
When
it
was
almost
midnight
,
and
the
prison
had
long
been
quiet
,
a
cautious
creak
came
up
the
stairs
,
and
a
cautious
tap
of
a
key
was
given
at
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Young
John
.
 
<EOS>
He
glided
in
,
in
his
stockings
,
and
held
the
door
closed
,
while
he
spoke
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
against
all
rules
,
but
I
do
n't
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
come
through
,
and
come
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
's
the
matter
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
waiting
in
the
court
-
yard
for
Miss
Dorrit
when
she
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
'd
like
some
one
to
see
that
she
was
safe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
took
her
home
,
John
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
her
to
her
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
that
Mr
Dorrit
was
at
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dorrit
walked
all
the
way
,
and
talked
to
me
so
kind
,
it
quite
knocked
me
over
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
think
she
walked
instead
of
riding
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
John
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
talk
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
to
me
,
"
John
,
you
was
always
honourable
,
and
if
you
'll
promise
me
that
you
will
take
care
of
him
,
and
never
let
him
want
for
help
and
comfort
when
I
am
not
there
,
my
mind
will
be
at
rest
so
far
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
promised
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
stand
by
you
,
"
said
John
Chivery
,
"
for
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
,
much
affected
,
stretched
out
his
hand
to
this
honest
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Before
I
take
it
,
"
said
John
,
looking
at
it
,
without
coming
from
the
door
<EOS>
,
"
guess
what
message
Miss
Dorrit
gave
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Tell
him
,
"
"
repeated
John
,
in
a
distinct
,
though
quavering
voice
,
"
"
that
his
Little
Dorrit
sent
him
her
undying
love
.
"
 
<EOS>
Now
it
's
delivered
.
 
<EOS>
Have
I
been
honourable
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
very
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
Miss
Dorrit
I
've
been
honourable
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
my
hand
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
'll
stand
by
you
forever
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
hearty
squeeze
,
he
disappeared
with
the
same
cautious
creak
upon
the
stair
,
crept
shoeless
over
the
pavement
of
the
yard
,
and
,
locking
the
gates
behind
him
,
passed
out
into
the
front
where
he
had
left
his
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
same
way
had
been
paved
with
burning
ploughshares
,
it
is
not
at
all
improbable
that
John
would
have
traversed
it
with
the
same
devotion
,
for
the
same
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
30
.
<EOS>
Closing
in
 
<EOS>
The
last
day
of
the
appointed
week
touched
the
bars
of
the
Marshalsea
gate
.
 
<EOS>
Black
,
all
night
,
since
the
gate
had
clashed
upon
Little
Dorrit
,
its
iron
stripes
were
turned
by
the
early
-
glowing
sun
into
stripes
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Far
aslant
across
the
city
,
over
its
jumbled
roofs
,
and
through
the
open
tracery
of
its
church
towers
,
struck
the
long
bright
rays
,
bars
of
the
prison
of
this
lower
world
.
   
<EOS>
Throughout
the
day
the
old
house
within
the
gateway
remained
untroubled
by
any
visitors
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
the
sun
was
low
,
three
men
turned
in
at
the
gateway
and
made
for
the
dilapidated
house
.
   
<EOS>
Rigaud
was
the
first
,
and
walked
by
himself
smoking
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
was
the
second
,
and
jogged
close
after
him
,
looking
at
no
other
object
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
was
the
third
,
and
carried
his
hat
under
his
arm
for
the
liberation
of
his
restive
hair
;
the
weather
being
extremely
hot
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
came
together
at
the
door
-
steps
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
pair
of
madmen
!
<EOS>
"
said
Rigaud
,
facing
about
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
yet
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
mean
to
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
.
<EOS>
Giving
him
a
dark
glance
in
acknowledgment
of
his
answer
,
Rigaud
knocked
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
charged
himself
with
drink
,
for
the
playing
out
of
his
game
,
and
was
impatient
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
finished
one
long
resounding
knock
,
when
he
turned
to
the
knocker
again
and
began
another
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
not
yet
finished
when
Jeremiah
Flintwinch
opened
the
door
,
and
they
all
clanked
into
the
stone
hall
.
 
<EOS>
Rigaud
,
thrusting
Mr
Flintwinch
aside
,
proceeded
straight
up
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
His
two
attendants
followed
him
,
Mr
Flintwinch
followed
them
,
and
they
all
came
trooping
into
Mrs
Clennam
's
quiet
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
its
usual
state
;
except
that
one
of
the
windows
was
wide
open
,
and
Affery
sat
on
its
old
-
fashioned
window
-
seat
,
mending
a
stocking
.
 
<EOS>
The
usual
articles
were
on
the
little
table
;
the
usual
deadened
fire
was
in
the
grate
;
the
bed
had
its
usual
pall
upon
it
;
and
the
mistress
of
all
sat
on
her
black
bier
-
like
sofa
,
propped
up
by
her
black
angular
bolster
that
was
like
the
headsman
's
block
.
   
<EOS>
Yet
there
was
a
nameless
air
of
preparation
in
the
room
,
as
if
it
were
strung
up
for
an
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
From
what
the
room
derived
it
---
every
one
of
its
small
variety
of
objects
being
in
the
fixed
spot
it
had
occupied
for
years
---
no
one
could
have
said
without
looking
attentively
at
its
mistress
,
and
that
,
too
,
with
a
previous
knowledge
of
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
Although
her
unchanging
black
dress
was
in
every
plait
precisely
as
of
old
,
and
her
unchanging
attitude
was
rigidly
preserved
,
a
very
slight
additional
setting
of
her
features
and
contraction
of
her
gloomy
forehead
was
so
powerfully
marked
,
that
it
marked
everything
about
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
are
these
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
wonderingly
,
as
the
two
attendants
entered
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
these
people
want
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
are
these
,
dear
madame
,
is
it
?
"
returned
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Faith
,
they
are
friends
of
your
son
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
do
they
want
here
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Death
,
madame
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
do
well
to
ask
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
told
us
at
the
door
,
not
to
go
yet
,
"
said
Pancks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
know
you
told
me
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
you
did
n't
mean
to
go
,
"
retorted
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
madame
,
permit
me
to
present
two
spies
of
the
prisoner
's
---
madmen
,
but
spies
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
wish
them
to
remain
here
during
our
little
conversation
,
say
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
nothing
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
wish
them
to
remain
here
?
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
to
do
with
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
dearest
madame
,
"
said
Rigaud
,
throwing
himself
into
an
arm
-
chair
so
heavily
that
the
old
room
trembled
,
"
you
will
do
well
to
dismiss
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
your
affair
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
my
spies
,
not
my
rascals
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
You
Pancks
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
bending
her
brows
upon
him
angrily
,
"
you
Casby
's
clerk
!
 
<EOS>
Attend
to
your
employer
's
business
and
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
Go
.
 
<EOS>
And
take
that
other
man
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Mr
Pancks
,
"
I
am
glad
to
say
I
see
no
objection
to
our
both
retiring
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
done
all
we
undertook
to
do
for
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
His
constant
anxiety
has
been
(
and
it
grew
worse
upon
him
when
he
became
a
prisoner
)
,
that
this
agreeable
gentleman
should
be
brought
back
here
to
the
place
from
which
he
slipped
away
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
is
---
brought
back
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
will
say
,
"
added
Mr
Pancks
,
"
to
his
ill
-
looking
face
,
that
in
my
opinion
the
world
would
be
no
worse
for
his
slipping
out
of
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
opinion
is
not
asked
,
"
answered
Mrs
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
not
to
leave
you
in
better
company
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Pancks
;
"
and
sorry
,
too
,
that
Mr
Clennam
ca
n't
be
present
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
my
fault
,
that
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
his
own
,
"
she
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
mean
mine
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
<EOS>
for
it
was
my
misfortune
to
lead
him
into
a
ruinous
investment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Mr
Pancks
still
clung
to
that
word
,
and
never
said
speculation
.
)
<EOS>
"
Though
I
can
prove
by
figures
,
"
added
Mr
Pancks
,
with
an
anxious
countenance
,
"
that
it
ought
to
have
been
a
good
investment
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
gone
over
it
since
it
failed
,
every
day
of
my
life
,
and
it
comes
out
---
regarded
as
a
question
of
figures
---
triumphant
.
 
<EOS>
The
present
is
not
a
time
or
place
,
"
Mr
Pancks
pursued
,
with
a
longing
glance
into
his
hat
,
where
he
kept
his
calculations
,
"
for
entering
upon
the
figures
;
but
the
figures
are
not
to
be
disputed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
ought
to
have
been
at
this
moment
in
his
carriage
and
pair
,
and
I
ought
to
have
been
worth
from
three
to
five
thousand
pound
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
put
his
hair
erect
with
a
general
aspect
of
confidence
that
could
hardly
have
been
surpassed
,
if
he
had
had
the
amount
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
These
incontrovertible
figures
had
been
the
occupation
of
every
moment
of
his
leisure
since
he
had
lost
his
money
,
and
were
destined
to
afford
him
consolation
to
the
end
of
his
days
.
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
"
enough
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Altro
,
old
boy
,
you
have
seen
the
figures
,
and
you
know
how
they
come
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Baptist
,
who
had
not
the
slightest
arithmetical
power
of
compensating
himself
in
this
way
,
nodded
,
with
a
fine
display
of
bright
teeth
.
   
<EOS>
At
whom
Mr
Flintwinch
had
been
looking
,
and
to
whom
he
then
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
it
's
you
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
remembered
your
face
,
but
I
was
n't
certain
till
I
saw
your
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
yes
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
this
officious
refugee
,
"
said
Jeremiah
to
Mrs
Clennam
,
"
who
came
knocking
at
the
door
on
the
night
when
Arthur
and
Chatterbox
were
here
,
and
who
asked
me
a
whole
Catechism
of
questions
about
Mr
Blandois
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
Mr
Baptist
cheerfully
admitted
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
behold
him
,
padrone
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
found
him
consequentementally
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
have
objected
,
"
returned
Mr
Flintwinch
,
"
to
your
having
broken
your
neck
consequentementally
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
whose
eye
had
often
stealthily
wandered
to
the
window
-
seat
and
the
stocking
that
was
being
mended
there
,
"
I
've
only
one
other
word
to
say
before
I
go
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Clennam
was
here
---
but
unfortunately
,
though
he
has
so
far
got
the
better
of
this
fine
gentleman
as
to
return
him
to
this
place
against
his
will
,
he
is
ill
and
in
prison
---
ill
and
in
prison
,
poor
fellow
---
if
he
was
here
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
taking
one
step
aside
towards
the
window
-
seat
,
and
laying
his
right
hand
upon
the
stocking
;
"
he
would
say
,
"
Affery
,
tell
your
dreams
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
held
up
his
right
forefinger
between
his
nose
and
the
stocking
with
a
ghostly
air
of
warning
,
turned
,
steamed
out
and
towed
Mr
Baptist
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
-
door
was
heard
to
close
upon
them
,
their
steps
were
heard
passing
over
the
dull
pavement
of
the
echoing
court
-
yard
,
and
still
nobody
had
added
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
and
Jeremiah
had
exchanged
a
look
;
and
had
then
looked
,
and
looked
still
,
at
Affery
,
who
sat
mending
the
stocking
with
great
assiduity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mr
Flintwinch
at
length
,
screwing
himself
a
curve
or
two
in
the
direction
of
the
window
-
seat
,
and
rubbing
the
palms
of
his
hands
on
his
coat
-
tail
as
if
he
were
preparing
them
to
do
something
:
"
Whatever
has
to
be
said
among
us
had
better
be
begun
to
be
said
without
more
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
So
,
Affery
,
my
woman
,
take
yourself
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
a
moment
Affery
had
thrown
the
stocking
down
,
started
up
,
caught
hold
of
the
windowsill
with
her
right
hand
,
lodged
herself
upon
the
window
-
seat
with
her
right
knee
,
and
was
flourishing
her
left
hand
,
beating
expected
assailants
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

I
wo
n't

Jeremiah

<EOS>
no
,
I
wo

<EOS>
no

I
wo

<EOS>
I
wo

<EOS>
I
'll
stay
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
hear
all
I

and
say
all
I

<EOS>
I
will

at

I
die
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
,
I

I

I

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
stiffening
with
indignation
and
amazement
,
moistened
the
fingers
of
one
hand
at
his
lips
,
softly
described
a
circle
with
them
in
the
palm
of
the
other
hand
,
and
continued
with
a
menacing
grin
to
screw
himself
in
the
direction
of
his
wife
;
gasping
some
remark
as
he
advanced
,
of
which
,
in
his
choking
anger
,
only
the
words
,
"
Such
a
dose
!
"
were
audible
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
nearer
,
Jeremiah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Affery
,
never
ceasing
to
beat
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
come
a
bit
nearer
to
me
,
or
I
'll
rouse
the
neighbourhood
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
throw
myself
out
of
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
scream
Fire
and
Murder
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wake
the
dead
!
 
<EOS>
Stop
where
you
are
,
or
I
'll
make
shrieks
enough
to
wake
the
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
determined
voice
of
Mrs
Clennam
echoed
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
Jeremiah
had
stopped
already
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
closing
in
,
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Affery
,
do
you
turn
against
me
after
these
many
years
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
if
it
's
turning
against
you
to
hear
what
I
do
n't
know
,
and
say
what
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
broke
out
now
,
and
I
ca
n't
go
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
determined
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
it
,
<EOS>
I
will
,
I
will
,
I
will
!
 
<EOS>
If
that
's
turning
against
you
,
yes
,
I
turn
against
both
of
you
two
clever
ones
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
Arthur
when
he
first
come
home
to
stand
up
against
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
it
was
no
reason
,
because
I
was
afeard
of
my
life
of
you
,
that
he
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
All
manner
of
things
have
been
a
-
going
on
since
then
,
and
I
wo
n't
be
run
up
by
Jeremiah
,
nor
<EOS>
yet
I
wo
n't
be
dazed
and
scared
,
nor
made
a
party
to
<EOS>
I
do
n't

no

<EOS>
I
wo
n't

I

I
wo

<EOS>
I
'll
up
for
Arthur
when
he
has
nothing
left
,
and
is
ill
,
and
in
prison
,
and
ca
n't
up
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
<EOS>
,
I
will

I

I
will
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
,
you
heap
of
confusion
,
"
asked
Mrs
Clennam
sternly
,
"
that
in
doing
what
you
are
doing
now
,
you
are
even
serving
Arthur
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
nothing
rightly
about
anything
,
"
said
Affery
;
"
and
if
ever
you
said
a
true
word
in
your
life
,
it
's
when
you
call
me
a
heap
of
confusion
,
for
you
two
clever
ones
have
done
your
most
to
make
me
such
.
 
<EOS>
You
married
me
whether
I
liked
it
or
not
,
and
you
've
led
me
,
pretty
well
ever
since
,
such
a
life
of
dreaming
and
frightening
as
never
was
known
,
and
what
do
you
expect
me
to
be
<EOS>
but
a
heap
of
confusion
?
 
<EOS>
You
wanted
to
make
me
such
,
and
I
am
such
;
but
I
wo
n't
submit
no
longer
;
no
,
I
wo
n't
<EOS>
,
I
wo
n't
,
I
wo
n't
,
I
wo
n't
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
still
beating
the
air
against
all
comers
.
   
<EOS>
After
gazing
at
her
in
silence
,
Mrs
Clennam
turned
to
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
and
hear
this
foolish
creature
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
object
to
such
a
piece
of
distraction
remaining
where
she
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
madame
,
"
he
replied
,
"
do
I
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
question
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
she
said
,
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
little
left
to
choose
now
.
 
<EOS>
Flintwinch
,
it
is
closing
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
replied
by
directing
a
look
of
red
vengeance
at
his
wife
,
and
then
,
as
if
to
pinion
himself
from
falling
upon
her
,
screwed
his
crossed
arms
into
the
breast
of
his
waistcoat
,
and
with
his
chin
very
near
one
of
his
elbows
stood
in
a
corner
,
watching
Rigaud
in
the
oddest
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
Rigaud
,
for
his
part
,
arose
from
his
chair
,
and
seated
himself
on
the
table
with
his
legs
dangling
.
<EOS>
In
this
easy
attitude
,
he
met
Mrs
Clennam
's
set
face
,
with
his
moustache
going
up
and
his
nose
coming
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madame
,
I
am
a
gentleman
---
"
   
"
Of
whom
,
"
she
interrupted
in
her
steady
tones
,
"
I
have
heard
disparagement
,
in
connection
with
a
French
jail
and
an
accusation
of
murder
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
kissed
his
hand
to
her
with
his
exaggerated
gallantry
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
Exactly
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
lady
too
!
 
<EOS>
What
absurdity
!
 
<EOS>
How
incredible
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
honour
of
making
a
great
success
then
;
I
hope
to
have
the
honour
of
making
a
great
success
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
kiss
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
,
I
am
a
gentleman
(
I
was
going
to
observe
)
,
who
when
he
says
,
"
I
will
definitely
finish
this
or
that
affair
at
the
present
sitting
,
"
does
definitely
finish
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
announce
to
you
that
we
are
arrived
at
our
last
sitting
on
our
little
business
.
<EOS>
You
do
me
the
favour
to
follow
,
and
to
comprehend
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
with
a
frown
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Further
,
I
am
a
gentleman
to
whom
mere
mercenary
trade
-
bargains
are
unknown
,
but
to
whom
money
is
always
acceptable
as
the
means
of
pursuing
his
pleasures
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
me
the
favour
to
follow
,
and
to
comprehend
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Scarcely
necessary
to
ask
,
one
would
say
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Further
,
I
am
a
gentleman
of
the
softest
and
sweetest
disposition
,
but
who
,
if
trifled
with
,
becomes
enraged
.
 
<EOS>
Noble
natures
under
such
circumstances
become
enraged
.
 
<EOS>
I
possess
a
noble
nature
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
lion
is
awakened
---
that
is
to
say
,
when
I
enrage
---
the
satisfaction
of
my
animosity
is
as
acceptable
to
me
as
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
always
do
me
the
favour
to
follow
,
and
to
comprehend
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
answered
,
somewhat
louder
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
not
let
me
derange
you
;
pray
be
tranquil
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
said
we
are
now
arrived
at
our
last
sitting
.
 
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
recall
the
two
sittings
we
have
held
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
necessary
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Death
,
madame
<EOS>
,
"
he
burst
out
,
"
it
's
my
fancy
!
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
clears
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
sitting
was
limited
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
honour
of
making
your
acquaintance
---
of
presenting
my
letter
;
I
am
a
Knight
of
Industry
,
at
your
service
,
madame
,
but
my
polished
manners
had
won
me
so
much
of
success
,
as
a
master
of
languages
,
among
your
compatriots
who
are
as
stiff
as
their
own
starch
is
to
one
another
,
but
are
ready
to
relax
to
a
foreign
gentleman
of
polished
manners
---
and
of
observing
one
or
two
little
things
,
"
he
glanced
around
the
room
and
smiled
,
"
about
this
honourable
house
,
to
know
which
was
necessary
to
assure
me
,
and
to
convince
me
that
I
had
the
distinguished
pleasure
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
lady
I
sought
.
 
<EOS>
I
achieved
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
my
word
of
honour
to
our
dear
Flintwinch
that
I
would
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
gracefully
departed
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
face
neither
acquiesced
nor
demurred
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
when
he
paused
,
and
when
he
spoke
,
it
as
yet
showed
him
always
the
one
attentive
frown
,
and
the
dark
revelation
before
mentioned
of
her
being
nerved
for
the
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
gracefully
departed
,
because
it
was
graceful
to
retire
without
alarming
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
morally
graceful
,
not
less
than
physically
,
is
a
part
of
the
character
of
Rigaud
Blandois
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
also
politic
,
as
leaving
you
with
something
overhanging
you
,
to
expect
me
again
with
a
little
anxiety
on
a
day
not
named
.
 
<EOS>
But
your
slave
is
politic
.
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
madame
,
politic
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
return
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
not
named
,
I
have
again
the
honour
to
render
myself
at
your
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
intimate
that
I
have
something
to
sell
,
which
,
if
not
bought
,
will
compromise
madame
whom
I
highly
esteem
.
 
<EOS>
I
explain
myself
generally
.
 
<EOS>
I
demand
<EOS>
---
I
think
it
was
a
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Will
you
correct
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
forced
to
speak
,
she
replied
with
constraint
,
"
You
demanded
as
much
as
a
thousand
pounds
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
demand
at
present
,
Two
.
 
<EOS>
Such
are
the
evils
of
delay
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
return
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
accordant
;
we
differ
on
that
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
playful
;
playfulness
is
a
part
of
my
amiable
character
.
 
<EOS>
Playfully
,
I
become
as
one
slain
and
hidden
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
it
may
alone
be
worth
half
the
sum
to
madame
,
to
be
freed
from
the
suspicions
that
my
droll
idea
awakens
.
 
<EOS>
Accident
and
spies
intermix
themselves
against
my
playfulness
,
and
spoil
the
fruit
,
perhaps
---
who
knows
?
 
<EOS>
only
you
and
Flintwinch
---
when
it
is
just
ripe
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
madame
,
I
am
here
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
Listen
!
 
<EOS>
Definitely
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
struck
his
straggling
boot
-
heels
against
the
flap
of
the
table
,
meeting
her
frown
with
an
insolent
gaze
,
he
began
to
change
his
tone
for
a
fierce
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
 
<EOS>
Stop
an
instant
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
advance
by
steps
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
my
Hotel
-
note
to
be
paid
,
according
to
contract
.
 
<EOS>
Five
minutes
hence
we
may
be
at
daggers
'
points
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
leave
it
till
then
,
or
you
'll
cheat
me
.
 
<EOS>
Pay
it
!
 
<EOS>
Count
me
the
money
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Take
it
from
his
hand
and
pay
it
,
Flintwinch
,
"
said
Mrs
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
He
spirted
it
into
Mr
Flintwinch
's
face
when
the
old
man
advanced
to
take
it
,
and
held
forth
his
hand
,
repeating
noisily
,
"
Pay
it
!
<EOS>
Count
it
out
!
 
<EOS>
Good
money
!
"
 
<EOS>
Jeremiah
picked
the
bill
up
,
looked
at
the
total
with
a
bloodshot
eye
,
took
a
small
canvas
bag
from
his
pocket
,
and
told
the
amount
into
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Rigaud
chinked
the
money
,
weighed
it
in
his
hand
,
threw
it
up
a
little
way
and
caught
it
,
chinked
it
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sound
of
it
,
to
the
bold
Rigaud
Blandois
,
is
like
the
taste
of
fresh
meat
to
the
tiger
.
 
<EOS>
Say
,
then
,
madame
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
turned
upon
her
suddenly
with
a
menacing
gesture
of
the
weighted
hand
that
clenched
the
money
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
strike
her
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
again
,
as
I
told
you
before
,
that
we
are
not
rich
here
,
as
you
suppose
us
to
be
,
and
that
your
demand
is
excessive
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
present
means
of
complying
with
such
a
demand
,
if
I
had
ever
so
great
an
inclination
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
!
"
cried
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
this
lady
with
her
<EOS>
If
!
 
<EOS>
Will
you
say
that
you
have
not
the
inclination
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
what
presents
itself
to
me
,
and
not
what
presents
itself
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
it
then
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
!
 
<EOS>
Come
to
the
inclination
,
and
I
know
what
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
no
quicker
,
and
no
slower
,
in
her
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
seem
that
you
have
obtained
possession
of
a
paper
---
or
of
papers
---
which
I
assuredly
have
the
inclination
to
recover
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rigaud
,
with
a
loud
laugh
,
drummed
his
heels
against
the
table
,
and
chinked
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
paper
might
be
worth
,
to
me
,
a
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
how
much
,
or
how
little
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
the
Devil
!
"
<EOS>
he
asked
savagely
.
"
<EOS>
Not
after
a
week
's
grace
to
consider
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
No
!
 
I
will
not
out
of
my
scanty
means
---
for
I
tell
you
again
,
we
are
poor
here
,
and
not
rich
---
I
will
not
offer
any
price
for
a
power
that
I
do
not
know
the
worst
and
the
fullest
extent
of
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
third
time
of
your
hinting
and
threatening
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
speak
explicitly
,
or
you
may
go
where
you
will
,
and
do
what
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
better
to
be
torn
to
pieces
at
a
spring
,
than
to
be
a
mouse
at
the
caprice
of
such
a
cat
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
so
hard
with
those
eyes
too
near
together
that
the
sinister
sight
of
each
,
crossing
that
of
the
other
,
seemed
to
make
the
bridge
of
his
hooked
nose
crooked
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
long
survey
,
he
said
,
with
the
further
setting
off
of
his
internal
smile
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
bold
woman
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
resolved
woman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
always
were
.
 
<EOS>
What
?
 
<EOS>
She
always
was
;
is
it
not
so
,
my
little
Flintwinch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Flintwinch
,
say
nothing
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
for
him
to
say
,
here
and
now
,
all
he
can
;
or
to
go
hence
,
and
do
all
he
can
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
this
to
be
our
determination
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
him
to
his
action
on
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
did
not
shrink
under
his
evil
leer
,
or
avoid
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
it
upon
her
again
,
but
she
remained
steady
at
the
point
to
which
she
had
fixed
herself
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
off
the
table
,
placed
a
chair
near
the
sofa
,
sat
down
in
it
,
and
leaned
an
arm
upon
the
sofa
close
to
her
own
,
which
he
touched
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
ever
frowning
,
attentive
,
and
settled
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
pleasure
then
,
madame
,
that
I
shall
relate
a
morsel
of
family
history
in
this
little
family
society
,
"
said
Rigaud
,
with
a
warning
play
of
his
lithe
fingers
on
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
something
of
a
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
touch
your
pulse
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
suffered
him
to
take
her
wrist
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Holding
it
,
he
proceeded
to
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
A
history
of
a
strange
marriage
,
and
a
strange
mother
,
and
a
revenge
,
and
a
suppression
.
<EOS>
---
Aye
,
aye
,
aye
?
 
<EOS>
this
pulse
is
beating
curiously
!
 
<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
that
it
doubles
while
I
touch
it
.
 
<EOS>
Are
these
the
usual
changes
of
your
malady
,
madame
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
struggle
in
her
maimed
arm
as
she
twisted
it
away
,
but
there
was
none
in
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
face
there
was
his
own
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
lived
an
adventurous
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
an
adventurous
character
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
many
adventurers
;
interesting
spirits
---
amiable
society
!
 
<EOS>
To
one
of
them
<EOS>
I
owe
my
knowledge
and
my
proofs
---
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
,
estimable
lady
---
proofs
---
of
the
ravishing
little
family
history
I
go
to
commence
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
charmed
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
bah
!
 
<EOS>
I
forget
.
 
<EOS>
One
should
name
a
history
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
name
it
the
history
of
a
house
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
bah
,
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
so
many
houses
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
name
it
the
history
of
this
house
?
"
   
<EOS>
Leaning
over
the
sofa
,
poised
on
two
legs
of
his
chair
and
his
left
elbow
;
that
hand
often
tapping
her
arm
to
beat
his
words
home
;
his
legs
crossed
;
his
right
hand
sometimes
arranging
his
hair
,
sometimes
smoothing
his
moustache
,
sometimes
striking
his
nose
,
always
threatening
her
whatever
it
did
;
coarse
,
insolent
,
rapacious
,
cruel
,
and
powerful
,
he
pursued
his
narrative
at
his
ease
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
fine
,
then
,
I
name
it
the
history
of
this
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
commence
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
live
here
,
let
us
suppose
,
an
uncle
and
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
The
uncle
,
a
rigid
old
gentleman
of
strong
force
of
character
;
the
nephew
,
habitually
timid
,
repressed
,
and
under
constraint
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
,
fixedly
attentive
in
the
window
-
seat
,
biting
the
rolled
up
end
of
her
apron
,
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
,
here
cried
out
,
"
Jeremiah
,
keep
off
from
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
heerd
,
in
my
dreams
,
of
Arthur
's
father
and
his
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
talking
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
before
my
time
here
;
but
I
've
heerd
in
my
dreams
that
Arthur
's
father
was
a
poor
,
irresolute
,
frightened
chap
,
who
had
had
everything
but
<EOS>
his
orphan
life
scared
out
of
him
when
he
was
young
,
and
that
he
had
no
voice
in
the
choice
of
his
wife
even
,
but
his
uncle
chose
her
.
 
<EOS>
There
she
sits
!
 
<EOS>
I
heerd
it
in
my
dreams
,
and
you
said
it
to
her
own
self
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Flintwinch
shook
his
fist
at
her
,
and
as
Mrs
Clennam
gazed
upon
her
,
Rigaud
kissed
his
hand
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
right
,
dear
Madame
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
genius
for
dreaming
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
none
of
your
praises
,
"
returned
Affery
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
have
nothing
at
all
to
say
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
Jeremiah
said
they
was
dreams
,
and
I
'll
tell
'em
as
such
!
"
 
<EOS>
Here
she
put
her
apron
in
her
mouth
again
,
as
if
she
were
stopping
somebody
else
's
mouth
---
perhaps
jeremiah
's
,
which
was
chattering
with
threats
as
if
he
were
grimly
cold
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Our
beloved
Madame
Flintwinch
,
"
said
Rigaud
,
"
developing
all
of
a
sudden
a
fine
susceptibility
and
spirituality
,
is
right
to
a
marvel
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
So
runs
the
history
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
the
uncle
,
commands
the
nephew
to
marry
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
says
to
him
in
effect
,
"
My
nephew
,
I
introduce
to
you
a
lady
of
strong
force
of
character
,
like
myself
---
a
resolved
lady
,
a
stern
lady
,
a
lady
who
has
a
will
that
can
break
the
weak
to
powder
:
a
lady
without
pity
,
without
love
,
implacable
,
revengeful
,
cold
as
the
stone
,
but
raging
as
the
fire
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
what
fortitude
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
what
superiority
of
intellectual
strength
!
 
<EOS>
Truly
,
a
proud
and
noble
character
that
I
describe
in
the
supposed
words
of
Monsieur
,
the
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Death
of
my
soul
<EOS>
,
I
love
the
sweet
lady
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
's
face
had
changed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
remarkable
darkness
of
colour
on
it
,
and
the
brow
was
more
contracted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Madame
,
madame
,
"
said
Rigaud
,
tapping
her
on
the
arm
,
as
if
his
cruel
hand
were
sounding
a
musical
instrument
<EOS>
,
"
I
perceive
I
interest
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
perceive
I
awaken
your
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
drooping
nose
and
the
ascending
moustache
had
,
however
,
to
be
hidden
for
a
moment
with
the
white
hand
,
before
he
could
go
on
;
he
enjoyed
the
effect
he
made
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
nephew
,
being
,
as
the
lucid
Madame
Flintwinch
has
remarked
,
a
poor
devil
who
has
had
everything
but
his
orphan
life
frightened
and
famished
out
of
him
---
the
nephew
abases
his
head
,
and
makes
response
:
"
My
uncle
,
it
is
to
you
to
command
.
 
<EOS>
Do
as
you
will
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
the
uncle
,
does
as
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
what
he
always
does
.
<EOS>
The
auspicious
nuptials
take
place
;
the
newly
married
come
home
to
this
charming
mansion
;
the
lady
is
received
,
let
us
suppose
,
by
Flintwinch
.
 
<EOS>
Hey
,
old
intriguer
?
"
   
<EOS>
Jeremiah
,
with
his
eyes
upon
his
mistress
,
made
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Rigaud
looked
from
one
to
the
other
,
struck
his
ugly
nose
,
and
made
a
clucking
with
his
tongue
.
   
<EOS>
"
Soon
the
lady
makes
a
singular
and
exciting
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
full
of
anger
,
full
of
jealousy
,
full
of
vengeance
<EOS>
,
she
forms
---
see
you
,
madame
!
---
a
scheme
of
retribution
,
the
weight
of
which
she
ingeniously
forces
her
crushed
husband
to
bear
himself
,
as
well
as
execute
upon
her
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
What
superior
intelligence
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
off
,
Jeremiah
!
"
cried
the
palpitating
Affery
,
taking
her
apron
from
her
mouth
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
one
of
my
dreams
,
that
you
told
her
,
when
you
quarrelled
with
her
one
winter
evening
at
dusk
---
there
she
sits
and
you
looking
at
her
---
that
she
ought
n't
to
have
let
Arthur
when
he
come
home
,
suspect
his
father
only
;
that
she
had
always
had
the
strength
and
the
power
;
and
that
she
ought
to
have
stood
up
more
to
Arthur
,
for
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
same
dream
where
you
said
to
her
that
she
was
not

not
something
,
but
I
do
n't
know
what
,
for
she
burst
out
tremendous
and
stopped
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
dream
as
well
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
come
down
-
stairs
into
the
kitchen
with
the
candle
in
your
hand
,
and
hitched
my
apron
off
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
told
me
I
had
been
dreaming
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
would
n't
believe
the
noises
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
After
this
explosion
Affery
put
her
apron
into
her
mouth
again
;
always
keeping
her
hand
on
the
window
-
sill
and
her
knee
on
the
window
-
seat
,
ready
to
cry
out
or
jump
out
if
her
lord
and
master
approached
.
   
<EOS>
Rigaud
had
not
lost
a
word
of
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
Haha
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
lifting
his
eyebrows
,
folding
his
arms
,
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
,
Madame
Flintwinch
is
an
oracle
!
 
<EOS>
How
shall
we
interpret
the
oracle
,
you
and
I
and
the
old
intriguer
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
that
you
were
not
---
?
 
<EOS>
And
you
burst
out
and
stopped
him
!
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
<EOS>
you
were
not
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
you
are
not
?
<EOS>
Say
then
,
madame
!
"
   
<EOS>
Under
this
ferocious
banter
,
she
sat
breathing
harder
,
and
her
mouth
was
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
Her
lips
quivered
and
opened
,
in
spite
of
her
utmost
efforts
to
keep
them
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
then
,
madame
!
 
<EOS>
Speak
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
Our
old
intriguer
said
that
you
were
not
---
 
and
you
stopped
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
say
that
you
were
not
---
<EOS>
what
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
already
,
but
I
want
a
little
confidence
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
what
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
tried
again
to
repress
herself
,
but
broke
out
vehemently
,
"
Not
Arthur
's
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
Rigaud
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
amenable
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
the
set
expression
of
her
face
all
torn
away
by
the
explosion
of
her
passion
,
and
with
a
bursting
,
from
every
rent
feature
,
of
the
smouldering
fire
so
long
pent
up
<EOS>
,
she
cried
out
:
"
I
will
tell
it
myself
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
hear
it
from
your
lips
,
and
with
the
taint
of
your
wickedness
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Since
it
must
be
seen
,
I
will
have
it
seen
by
the
light
I
stood
in

<EOS>
Not
another
word
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
me
!

<EOS>
"
Unless
you
are
a
more
obstinate
and
more
persisting
woman
than
even
I
know
you
to
be
,
"
Mr
Flintwinch
interposed
,
"
you
had
better
leave
Mr
Rigaud
,
Mr
Blandois
,
Mr
Beelzebub
,
to
tell
it
in
his
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
it
signify
when
he
knows
all
about
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
does
not
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
knows
all

cares
about
it
,
"
Mr
Flintwinch
testily
urged
.
<EOS>
"
He
does
not
know
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
suppose
he
cares
for
you
,
you
conceited
woman
?
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Flintwinch
,
I
will
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
when
it
has
come
to
this
,
I
will
tell
it
with
my
own
lips
,
and
will
express
myself
throughout
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
Have
I
suffered
nothing
in
this
room
,
no
deprivation
,
no
imprisonment
,
that
I
should
condescend
at
last
to
contemplate
myself
in
such
a
glass
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
see
him
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
hear
him
?
 
<EOS>
If
your
wife
were
a
hundred
times
the
ingrate
that
she
is
,
and
if
I
were
a
thousand
times
more
hopeless
than
I
am
of
inducing
her
to
be
silent
if
this
man
is
silenced
,
I
would
tell
it
myself
,
before
I
would
bear
the
torment
of
the
hearing
it
from
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rigaud
pushed
his
chair
a
little
back
;
pushed
his
legs
out
straight
before
him
;
and
sat
with
his
arms
folded
over
against
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
what
it
is
,
"
she
went
on
addressing
him
,
"
to
be
brought
up
strictly
and
straitly
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
brought
up
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
was
no
light
youth
of
sinful
gaiety
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
were
days
of
wholesome
repression
,
punishment
,
and
fear
.
 
<EOS>
The
corruption
of
our
hearts
,
the
evil
of
our
ways
,
the
curse
that
is
upon
us
,
the
terrors
that
surround
us
<EOS>
---
these
were
the
themes
of
my
childhood
.
<EOS>
They
formed
my
character
,
and
filled
me
with
an
abhorrence
of
evil
-
doers
.
<EOS>
When
old
Mr
Gilbert
Clennam
proposed
his
orphan
nephew
to
my
father
for
my
husband
,
my
father
impressed
upon
me
that
his
bringing
-
up
had
been
,
like
mine
,
one
of
severe
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
that
besides
the
discipline
his
spirit
had
undergone
,
he
had
lived
in
a
starved
house
,
where
rioting
and
gaiety
were
unknown
,
and
where
every
day
was
a
day
of
toil
and
trial
like
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
he
had
been
a
man
in
years
long
before
his
uncle
had
acknowledged
him
as
one
;
and
that
from
his
school
-
days
to
that
hour
,
his
uncle
's
roof
has
been
a
sanctuary
to
him
from
the
contagion
of
the
irreligious
and
dissolute
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
within
a
twelvemonth
of
our
marriage
,
I
found
my
husband
,
at
that
time
when
my
father
spoke
of
him
,
to
have
sinned
against
the
Lord
and
outraged
me
by
holding
a
guilty
creature
in
my
place
,
was
I
to
doubt
that
it
had
been
appointed
to
me
to
make
the
discovery
,
and
that
it
was
appointed
to
me
to
lay
the
hand
of
punishment
upon
that
creature
of
perdition
?
 
<EOS>
Was
I
to
dismiss
in
a
moment
---
not
my
own
wrongs
<EOS>
---
what
was
I
!
<EOS>
but
all
the
rejection
of
sin
,
and
all
the
war
against
it
,
in
which
I
had
been
bred
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
laid
her
wrathful
hand
upon
the
watch
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
forget
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
initials
of
those
words
are
within
here
now
,
and
were
within
here
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
appointed
to
find
the
old
letter
that
referred
to
them
,
and
that
told
me
what
they
meant
,
and
whose
work
they
were
,
and
why
they
were
worked
,
lying
with
this
watch
in
his
secret
drawer
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
that
appointment
there
would
have
been
no
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
forget
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
spoke
to
me
like
a
voice
from
an
angry
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
forget
the
deadly
sin
,
do
not
forget
the
appointed
discovery
,
do
not
forget
the
appointed
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
forget
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
my
own
wrong
<EOS>
I
remembered
?
<EOS>
Mine
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
but
a
servant
and
a
minister
.
 
<EOS>
What
power
could
I
have
over
them
,
but
that
they
were
bound
in
the
bonds
of
their
sin
,
and
delivered
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
More
than
forty
years
had
passed
over
the
grey
head
of
this
determined
woman
,
since
the
time
she
recalled
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
forty
years
of
strife
and
struggle
with
the
whisper
that
,
by
whatever
name
she
called
her
vindictive
pride
and
rage
,
nothing
through
all
eternity
could
change
their
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
gone
those
more
than
forty
years
,
and
come
this
Nemesis
now
looking
her
in
the
face
,
she
still
abided
by
her
old
impiety
---
still
reversed
the
order
of
Creation
,
and
breathed
her
own
breath
into
a
clay
image
of
her
Creator
.
 
<EOS>
Verily
,
verily
,
travellers
have
seen
many
monstrous
idols
in
many
countries
;
but
no
human
eyes
have
ever
seen
more
daring
,
gross
,
and
shocking
images
of
the
Divine
nature
than
we
creatures
of
the
dust
make
in
our
own
likenesses
,
of
our
own
bad
passions
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
forced
him
to
give
her
up
to
me
,
by
her
name
and
place
of
abode
,
"
she
went
on
in
her
torrent
of
indignation
and
defence
;
"
when
I
accused
her
,
and
she
fell
hiding
her
face
at
my
feet
,
was
it
my
injury
that
I
asserted
,
were
they
my
reproaches
that
I
poured
upon
her
?
 
<EOS>
Those
who
were
appointed
of
old
to
go
to
wicked
kings
and
accuse
them
---
were
they
not
ministers
and
servants
?
 
<EOS>
And
had
not
I
,
unworthy
and
far
-
removed
from
them
,
sin
to
denounce
?
 
<EOS>
When
she
pleaded
to
me
her
youth
,
and
his
wretched
and
hard
life
(
that
was
her
phrase
for
the
virtuous
training
he
had
belied
)
,
and
the
desecrated
ceremony
of
marriage
there
had
secretly
been
between
them
,
and
the
terrors
of
want
and
shame
that
had
overwhelmed
them
both
when
I
was
first
appointed
to
be
the
instrument
of
their
punishment
,
and
the
love
(
for
she
said
the
word
to
me
,
down
at
my
feet
)
in
which
she
had
abandoned
him
and
left
him
to
me
,
was
it
my
enemy
that
became
my
footstool
,
were
they
the
words
of
my
wrath
that
made
her
shrink
and
quiver
!
 
<EOS>
Not
unto
me
the
strength
be
ascribed
;
not
unto
me
the
wringing
of
the
expiation
!
"
   
<EOS>
Many
years
had
come
and
gone
since
she
had
had
the
free
use
even
of
her
fingers
;
but
it
was
noticeable
that
she
had
already
more
than
once
struck
her
clenched
hand
vigorously
upon
the
table
,
and
<EOS>
that
when
she
said
these
words
she
raised
her
whole
arm
in
the
air
,
as
though
it
had
been
a
common
action
with
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
was
the
repentance
that
was
extorted
from
the
hardness
of
her
heart
and
the
blackness
of
her
depravity

<EOS>
I
,
vindictive
and
implacable

It
may
be
so

such

you

know
no

no
appointment

Satan

Laugh
;

I
will
be
known
as
I
know
myself

Rigaud

"
Hah

penitence

in
works

That
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
to
sacrifice
her
sinful

shameful
affections

no
more

<EOS>
She
was
then
free
to
bear
her
load
of
guilt
in
secret

to
break
her
heart
in
secret

through
such
present
misery

light
enough
for
her

I
think

<EOS>
to
purchase
her
redemption
from
endless
misery

could

here

herself

If

threatened

then

encompassed

hold
them
in

She
turned
the
watch
upon
the
table
,
and
opened
it
,
and
,
with
an
unsoftening
face
,
looked
at
the
worked

As

might
it

live
so

many

devoted
myself

reclaim

predestined

were
heavy

I
do
NOT

it

I
read
in
it

that

appointed
to
do
these

I
have
so
read
these
three
letters

had
them
lying
on
this

I
did
so
read
them

with
equal
distinctness

were
thousands
of
miles
away

"
   
<EOS>
As
she
took
the
watch
-
case
in
her
hand
,
with
that
new
freedom
in
the
use
of
her
hand
of
which
she
showed
no
consciousness
<EOS>
whatever
,
bending
her
eyes
upon
it
as
if
she
were
defying
it
to
move
her
,
Rigaud
cried
with
a
loud
and
contemptuous
snapping
of
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
madame

<EOS>
Time
runs
out

Come

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wretch
that
you
are
<EOS>

"
she
answered
,
and
now
her
hands
clasped
her
head
:
"
through
what
fatal
error
of
Flintwinch
's
,
through
what
incompleteness
on
his
part
,
who
was
the
only
other
person
helping
in
these
things
and
trusted
with
them
,
through
whose
and
what
bringing
together
of
the
ashes
of
a
burnt
paper
,
you
have
become
possessed
of
that
codicil

I
know
no

how
you
acquired
the

your

"
And
yet
,
"
interrupted
Rigaud
,
"
it
is
my
odd
fortune
to
have
by
me
,
in
a
convenient
place
that

short
little
addition

the
will

she
answered
,
with
increased
determination
,
if
it
were
possible
.
 
<EOS>

I
,
because
I
will
not
endure

have
myself
shown

your
horrible
distortion
upon
me

<EOS>
You
,
with
your
practices
of
infamous
foreign
prisons

galleys
would
make
it
the
money

impelled
me

You

<EOS>
"
Not

<EOS>
She
made
a
struggle
as
if
she
were
starting
up
;
even
as
if
,
in
her
vehemence
,
she
had
almost
risen
on
her
disabled
feet

to

at

under
the
delusion

some
imaginary
relenting
towards
a
girl

he
had
heard
that
his
nephew
had
once
had
a
fancy
for
her
which
he
had
crushed
out

him

that
she
afterwards
drooped
away
into
melancholy

withdrawal

all

state

weakness

he
dictated
to

sin

her
wickedness

meant

supposed
unmerited
suffering

was
there
no

she
returned
,
"
I
would
stay

myself

<EOS>
Rigaud
snapped
his

tauntingly
in

One

<EOS>
You
will
never

<EOS>
"
That
patron

she
was
vehemently
proceeding
,
when
he
checked
her

<EOS>
"
That
Frederick
Dorrit
was
the
beginning
of
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
been
a
player
of
music
,
and
had
not
kept
,
in
those
days
of
his
youth
and
prosperity
,
an
idle
house
where
singers
,
and
players
,
and
such
-
like
children
of
Evil
turned
their
backs
on
the
Light
and
their
faces
to
the
Darkness
,
she
might
have
remained
in
her
lowly
station
,
and
might
not
have
been
raised
out
of
it
to
be
cast
down
.
<EOS>
But
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Satan
entered
into
that
Frederick
Dorrit
,
and
counselled
him
that
he
was
a
man
of
innocent
and
laudable
tastes
who
did
kind
actions
,
and
that
here
was
a
poor
girl
with
a
voice
for
singing
music
with
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
is
to
have
her
taught
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Arthur
's
father
,
who
has
all
along
been
secretly
pining
in
the
ways
of
virtuous
ruggedness
for
those
accursed
snares
which
are
called
the
Arts
,
becomes
acquainted
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
a
graceless
orphan
,
training
to
be
a
singing
girl
,
carries
it
,
by
that
Frederick
Dorrit
's
agency
,
against
me
,
and
I
am
humbled
and
deceived
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Not
I
,
that
is
to
say
,
"
she
added
quickly
,
as
colour
flushed
into
her
face
;
"
a
greater
than
I.
 
<EOS>
What
am
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Flintwinch
,
who
had
been
gradually
screwing
himself
towards
her
,
and
who
was
now
very
near
her
elbow
without
her
knowing
it
,
made
a
specially
wry
face
of
objection
when
she
said
these
words
,
and
moreover
twitched
his
gaiters
,
as
if
such
pretensions
were
equivalent
to
little
barbs
in
his
legs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lastly
,
"
she
continued
,
"
for
I
am
at
the
end
of
these
things
,
and
I
will
say
no
more
of
them
,
and
you
shall
say
no
more
of
them
,
and
all
that
remains
will
be
to
determine
whether
the
knowledge
of
them
can
be
kept
among
us
who
are
here
present
;
lastly
,
when
I
suppressed
that
paper
,
with
the
knowledge
of
Arthur
's
father
---
"
   
"
But
not
with
his
consent
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
said
with
his
consent
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
started
to
find
Jeremiah
so
near
her
,
and
drew
back
her
head
,
looking
at
him
with
some
rising
distrust
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
often
enough
between
us
when
he
would
have
had
me
produce
it
<EOS>
and
I
would
not
,
to
have
contradicted
me
if
I
had
said
,
with
his
consent
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
when
I
suppressed
that
paper
,
I
made
no
effort
to
destroy
it
,
but
kept
it
by
me
,
here
in
this
house
,
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
Gilbert
property
being
left
to
Arthur
's
father
,
I
could
at
any
time
,
without
unsettling
more
than
the
two
sums
,
have
made
a
pretence
of
finding
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
besides
that
I
must
have
supported
such
pretence
by
a
direct
falsehood
(
a
great
responsibility
)
,
I
have
seen
no
new
reason
,
in
all
the
time
I
have
been
tried
here
,
to
bring
it
to
light
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
rewarding
of
sin
;
the
wrong
result
of
a
delusion
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
what
I
was
appointed
to
do
,
and
I
have
undergone
,
within
these
four
walls
,
what
I
was
appointed
to
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
paper
was
at
last
destroyed
---
as
I
thought
---
in
my
presence
,
she
had
long
been
dead
,
and
her
patron
,
Frederick
Dorrit
,
had
long
been
deservedly
ruined
and
imbecile
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
found
the
niece
before
then
;
and
what
I
did
for
her
,
was
better
for
her
far
than
the
money
of
which
she
would
have
had
no
good
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
added
,
after
a
moment
,
as
though
she
addressed
the
watch
:
"
She
herself
was
innocent
,
and
I
might
not
have
forgotten
to
relinquish
it
to
her
at
my
death
:
"
and
sat
looking
at
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
recall
something
to
you
,
worthy
madame
?
"
said
Rigaud
.
<EOS>
"
The
little
paper
was
in
this
house
on
the
night
when
our
friend
the
prisoner
---
jail
-
comrade
of
my
soul
---
came
home
from
foreign
countries
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
recall
yet
something
more
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
The
little
singing
-
bird
that
never
was
fledged
,
was
long
kept
in
a
cage
by
a
guardian
of
your
appointing
,
well
enough
known
to
our
old
intriguer
here
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
coax
our
old
intriguer
to
tell
us
when
he
saw
him
last
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
!

<EOS>
cried
Affery
,
unstopping
her
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dreamed
it
,
first
of
all
my
dreams

<EOS>
Jeremiah
,
if
you
come
a

nigh
me
now

I
'll
scream
to
be
heard
at
St
Paul

<EOS>
The
person
as
this
man
has
spoken
of
,
was
jeremiah
's
own
twin
brother
;
and
he
was
here
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
on
the
night
when
Arthur
come
home
,
and
Jeremiah
with
his
own
hands
give
him
this
paper
,
along
with
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
more
,

he
took
it
away
in
an
iron
box

Help

Murder

<EOS>
Save
me
from
Jere

<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
had
made
a
run
at
her
,
but
Rigaud
had
caught
him
in
his
arms
midway
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
wrestle
with
him
,
Flintwinch
gave
up
,
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets

<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rigaud
,
rallying
him
as
he
poked
and
jerked
him
back
with
his
elbows
,
"
assault
a
lady
with
such
a
genius
for
dreaming

Flintwinch

So
like
him

I
knew
him
(
when
I
first
spoke
English
for
him
to
the
host
)
in
the
Cabaret
of
the
Three
Billiard
Tables
,
in
the
little
street
of
the
high
roofs
,
by
the
wharf
at
Antwerp
!
 
<EOS>
Ah

but
he
was
a
brave
boy
to
drink

<EOS>
Ah

but
he
was
a
brave
boy
to
smoke

<EOS>
Ah

but
he
lived
in
a
sweet
bachelor
-
apartment
---
furnished
,
on
the
fifth
floor
,
above
the
wood
and
charcoal
merchant

,
and
the
dress
-
maker
's
,
and
the
chair
-
maker
's
,
and
the
maker
of
tubs
---
where
I
knew
him
too
,
and
wherewith
his
cognac
and
tobacco
,
he
had
twelve
sleeps
a
day
and
one
fit
,
until
he
had
a
fit
too
much
,
and
ascended
to
the
skies

<EOS>
Ha

ha

<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
how
I
took
possession
of
the
papers
in
his
iron
box
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
confided
it
to
my
hands
for
you
,
perhaps
it
was
locked
and
my
curiosity
was
piqued
,
perhaps
I
suppressed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ha

ha

<EOS>
What
does
it
matter

so

it
safe

We

"
   
<EOS>
Retiring
before
him
with
vicious
counter
-
jerks
of
his
own
elbows
,
Mr
Flintwinch
had
got
back
into
his
corner
,
where
he
now
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets

taking
breath
,
and
returning
Mrs
Clennam
's
stare

<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
's
this
?

"
cried
Rigaud
.
<EOS>
"
It
appears
as

you
do
n't
know

one
the
other

Permit
me

<EOS>
Mr
Flintwinch
,
unpocketing
one
of
his
hands
to
scrape
his
jaw
,
advanced
a
step
or
so
in
that
attitude
,
still
returning
Mrs
Clennam
's
look
,
and
thus
addressed
her
:
   
"
<EOS>
Now
,
I
know
what
you
mean
by
opening
your
eyes
so
wide
at
me
,
but
you
need
n't
take
the
trouble
,
because
I
do
n't
care
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
telling
you
for
how
many
years
that
you
're
one
of
the
most
opinionated
and
obstinate
of
women

<EOS>
That
's
what
YOU
are

call
yourself
humble
and
sinful

you
are
the
most
Bumptious
of
your
sex

<EOS>
That
's
what
YOU
are
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
,
over
and
over
again
when
we
have
had
a
tiff
,
that
you
wanted
to
make
everything
go
down
before
you
,
but
I
would
n't
go
down
before
you

that
you
wanted
to
swallow
up
everybody
alive
,

I
would
n't
be
swallowed
up
alive

<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
destroy
the
paper
when
you
first
laid
hands
upon
it
?
   
<EOS>
I
advised
you
to
;
<EOS>
but
no
,
it
's
not
your
way
to
take
advice
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
keep
it
forsooth
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
may
carry
it
out
at
some
other
time
,
forsooth
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
I
did
n't
know
better
than
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
your
pride
carrying
it
out
,
with
a
chance
of
being
suspected
of
having
kept
it
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
's
the
way
you
cheat
yourself
.
<EOS>
just
as
you
cheat
yourself
into
making
out
that
you
did
n't
do
all
this
business
because
you
were
a
rigorous
woman
,
all
slight
,
and
spite
,
and
power
,
and
unforgiveness
,
but
because
you
were
a
servant
and
a
minister
,
and
were
appointed
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Who
are
you
,
that
you
should
be
appointed
to
do
it
?
 
<EOS>
That
may
be
your
religion
,
but
it
's
my
gammon
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
tell
you
all
the
truth
while
I
am
about
it
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
crossing
his
arms
,
and
becoming
the
express
image
of
irascible
doggedness
,
"
I
have
been
rasped
---
rasped
these
forty
years
---
by
your
taking
such
high
ground
even
with
me
,
who
knows
better
;
the
effect
of
it
being
coolly
to
put
me
on
low
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
admire
you
very
much
;
you
are
a
woman
of
strong
head
and
great
talent
;
but
the
strongest
head
,
and
the
greatest
talent
,
ca
n't
rasp
a
man
for
forty
years
without
making
him
sore
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
do
n't
care
for
your
present
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
coming
to
the
paper
,
and
mark
what
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
You
put
it
away
somewhere
,
and
you
kept
your
own
counsel
where
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
an
active
woman
at
that
time
,
and
if
you
want
to
get
that
paper
,
you
can
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
mark
.
 
<EOS>
There
comes
a
time
when
you
are
struck
into
what
you
are
now
,
and
then
if
you
want
to
get
that
paper
,
you
ca
n't
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
lies
,
long
years
,
in
its
hiding
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
we
are
expecting
Arthur
home
every
day
,
and
when
any
day
may
bring
him
home
,
and
it
's
impossible
to
say
what
rummaging
he
may
make
about
the
house
<EOS>
,
I
recommend
you
five
thousand
times
,
if
you
ca
n't
get
at
it
,
to
let
me
get
at
it
,
that
it
may
be
put
in
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
---
no
one
<EOS>
but
you
knows
where
it
is
,
and
that
's
power
;
and
,
call
yourself
whatever
humble
names
<EOS>
you
will
<EOS>
,
I
call
you
a
female
Lucifer
in
appetite
for
power
!
 
<EOS>
On
a
Sunday
night
,
Arthur
comes
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
not
been
in
this
room
ten
minutes
,
when
he
speaks
of
his
father
's
watch
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
the
Do
Not
Forget
,
at
the
time
when
his
father
sent
that
watch
to
you
,
<EOS>
could
only
mean
,
the
rest
of
the
story
being
then
all
dead
and
over
,
Do
Not
Forget
the
suppression
.
 
<EOS>
Make
restitution
!
<EOS>
Arthur
's
ways
have
frightened
you
a
bit
,
and
the
paper
shall
be
burnt
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
before
that
jumping
jade
and
Jezebel
,
"
Mr
Flintwinch
grinned
at
his
wife
,
"
has
got
you
into
bed
,
you
at
last
tell
me
where
you
have
put
the
paper
,
among
the
old
ledgers
in
the
cellars
,
where
Arthur
himself
went
prowling
the
very
next
morning
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
not
to
be
burnt
on
a
Sunday
night
.
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
you
are
strict
,
you
are
;
we
must
wait
over
twelve
o'clock
,
and
get
into
Monday
.
<EOS>
Now
,
all
this
is
a
swallowing
of
me
up
alive
that
rasps
me
;
so
,
feeling
a
little
out
of
temper
,
and
not
being
as
strict
as
yourself
<EOS>
,
I
take
a
look
at
the
document
before
twelve
o'clock
to
refresh
my
memory
as
to
its
appearance
---
fold
up
one
of
the
many
yellow
old
papers
in
the
cellars
like
it
---
and
afterwards
,
when
we
have
got
into
Monday
morning
,
and
I
have
,
by
the
light
of
your
lamp
,
to
walk
from
you
,
lying
on
that
bed
,
to
this
grate
,
make
a
little
exchange
like
the
conjuror
,
and
burn
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
My
brother
Ephraim
,
the
lunatic
-
keeper
(
I
wish
he
had
had
himself
to
keep
in
a
strait
-
waistcoat
)
,
had
had
many
jobs
since
the
close
of
the
long
job
he
got
from
you
,
but
had
not
done
well
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
died
(
not
that
that
was
much
;
mine
might
have
died
instead
,
and
welcome
)
,
he
speculated
unsuccessfully
in
lunatics
,
he
got
into
difficulty
about
over
-
roasting
a
patient
to
bring
him
to
reason
,
and
he
got
into
debt
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
going
out
of
the
way
,
on
what
he
had
been
able
to
scrape
up
,
and
a
trifle
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
here
that
early
Monday
morning
,
waiting
for
the
tide
;
in
short
,
he
was
going
to
Antwerp
,
<EOS>
where
(
I
am
afraid
you
'll
be
shocked
at
my
saying
,
And
be
damned
to
him
!
)
<EOS>
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
this
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
a
long
way
,
and
,
I
thought
then
,
was
only
sleepy
;
but
,
I
suppose
now
,
was
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
When
Arthur
's
mother
had
been
under
the
care
of
him
and
his
wife
,
she
had
been
always
writing
,
incessantly
writing
,
---
mostly
letters
of
confession
to
you
,
and
Prayers
for
forgiveness
.
 
<EOS>
My
brother
had
handed
,
from
time
to
time
,
lots
of
these
sheets
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
might
as
well
keep
them
to
myself
as
have
them
swallowed
up
alive
too
;
so
I
kept
them
in
a
box
,
looking
over
them
when
I
felt
in
the
humour
.
 
<EOS>
Convinced
that
it
was
advisable
to
get
the
paper
out
of
the
place
,
with
Arthur
coming
about
it
<EOS>
,
I
put
it
into
this
same
box
,
and
I
locked
the
whole
up
with
two
locks
,
and
I
trusted
it
to
my
brother
to
take
away
and
keep
,
till
I
should
write
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
write
about
it
,
and
never
got
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
,
till
this
gentleman
favoured
us
with
his
first
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
began
to
suspect
how
it
was
,
then
;
and
I
do
n't
want
his
word
for
it
now
to
understand
how
he
gets
his
knowledge
from
my
papers
,
and
your
paper
,
and
my
brother
's
cognac
and
tobacco
talk
<EOS>
(
I
wish
he
'd
had
to
gag
himself
)
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
have
only
one
thing
more
to
say
,
you
hammer
-
headed
woman
,
and
that
is
,
that
I
have
n't
altogether
made
up
my
mind
whether
I
might
,
or
might
not
,
have
ever
given
you
any
trouble
about
the
codicil
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
;
and
that
I
should
have
been
quite
satisfied
with
knowing
I
had
got
the
better
of
you
,
and
that
I
held
the
power
over
you
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
present
state
of
circumstances
,
I
have
no
more
explanation
to
give
you
till
this
time
to
-
morrow
night
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
may
as
well
,
"
said
Mr
Flintwinch
,
terminating
his
oration
with
a
screw
,
"
keep
your
eyes
open
at
somebody
else
,
for
it
's
no
use
keeping
'em
open
at
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
slowly
withdrew
them
when
he
had
ceased
,
and
dropped
her
forehead
on
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Her
other
hand
pressed
hard
upon
the
table
,
and
again
the
curious
stir
was
observable
in
her
,
as
if
she
were
going
to
rise
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
box
can
never
bring
,
elsewhere
,
the
price
it
will
bring
here
.
   
<EOS>
This
knowledge
can
never
be
of
the
same
profit
to
you
,
sold
to
any
other
person
,
as
sold
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
the
present
means
of
raising
the
sum
you
have
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
prospered
.
 
<EOS>
What
will
you
take
now
,
and
what
at
another
time
,
and
how
am
I
to
be
assured
of
your
silence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
angel
,
"
said
Rigaud
,
"
I
have
said
what
I
will
take
,
and
time
presses
.
 
<EOS>
Before
coming
here
,
I
placed
copies
of
the
most
important
of
these
papers
in
another
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Put
off
the
time
till
the
Marshalsea
gate
shall
be
shut
for
the
night
,
and
it
will
be
too
late
to
treat
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoner
will
have
read
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
put
her
two
hands
to
her
head
again
,
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
,
and
started
to
her
feet
.
 
<EOS>
She
staggered
for
a
moment
,
as
if
she
would
have
fallen
;
then
stood
firm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Say
what
you
mean
,
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
Before
her
ghostly
figure
,
so
long
unused
to
its
erect
attitude
,
and
so
stiffened
in
it
,
Rigaud
fell
back
and
dropped
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
to
all
the
three
,
almost
as
if
a
dead
woman
had
risen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dorrit
,
"
answered
Rigaud
,
"
the
little
niece
of
Monsieur
Frederick
,
whom
I
have
known
across
the
water
,
is
attached
to
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dorrit
,
little
niece
of
Monsieur
Frederick
,
watches
at
this
moment
over
the
prisoner
,
who
is
ill
.
 
<EOS>
For
her
I
with
my
own
hands
left
a
packet
at
the
prison
,
on
my
way
here
,
with
a
letter
of
instructions
,
"
FOR
HIS
SAKE
"
---
she
will
do
anything
for
his
sake
---
to
keep
it
without
breaking
the
seal
,
in
case
of
its
being
reclaimed
before
the
hour
of
shutting
up
to
-
night
---
if
it
should
not
be
reclaimed
before
the
ringing
of
the
prison
bell
,
to
give
it
to
him
;
and
it
encloses
a
second
copy
for
herself
,
which
he
must
give
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
trust
myself
among
you
,
now
we
have
got
so
far
,
without
giving
my
secret
a
second
life
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
its
not
bringing
me
,
elsewhere
,
the
price
it
will
bring
here
,
say
then
,
madame
,
have
you
limited
and
settled
the
price
the
little
niece
will
give
---
for
his
sake
---
to
hush
it
up
?
 
<EOS>
Once
more
I
say
,
time
presses
.
 
<EOS>
The
packet
not
reclaimed
before
the
ringing
of
the
bell
to
-
night
,
you
can
not
buy
.
 
<EOS>
I
sell
,
then
,
to
the
little
girl
!
"
   
<EOS>
Once
more
the
stir
and
struggle
in
her
,
and
she
ran
to
a
closet
,
tore
the
door
open
,
took
down
a
hood
or
shawl
,
and
wrapped
it
over
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
Affery
,
who
had
watched
her
in
terror
,
darted
to
her
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
caught
hold
of
her
dress
,
and
went
on
her
knees
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
doing
?
 
<EOS>
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
You
're
a
fearful
woman
,
but
I
do
n't
bear
you
no
ill
-
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
poor
Arthur
<EOS>
no
good
now
,
that
I
see
<EOS>
;
and
you
need
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
keep
your
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
out
,
you
'll
fall
dead
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Only
promise
me
,
that
,
if
it
's
the
poor
thing
that
's
kept
here
secretly
,
you
'll
let
me
take
charge
of
her
and
be
her
nurse
.
<EOS>
Only
promise
me
that
,
and
never
be
afraid
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
stood
still
for
an
instant
,
at
the
height
of
her
rapid
haste
,
saying
in
stern
amazement
:
   
<EOS>
"
Kept
here
?
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
dead
a
score
of
years
or
more
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
Flintwinch
---
ask
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
both
tell
you
that
she
died
when
Arthur
went
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
worse
,
"
said
Affery
,
with
a
shiver
,
"
for
she
haunts
the
house
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Who
else
rustles
about
it
,
making
signals
by
dropping
dust
so
softly
?
 
<EOS>
Who
else
comes
and
goes
,
and
marks
the
walls
with
long
crooked
touches
when
we
are
all
a
-
bed
?
 
<EOS>
Who
else
holds
the
door
sometimes
?
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
go
out
---
<EOS>
do
n't
go
out
!
<EOS>
Mistress
,
you
'll
die
in
the
street
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
mistress
only
disengaged
her
dress
from
the
beseeching
hands
,
said
to
Rigaud
,
"
Wait
here
till
I
come
back
!
"
and
ran
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
They
saw
her
,
from
the
window
,
run
wildly
through
the
court
-
yard
and
out
at
the
gateway
.
   
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
they
stood
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
Affery
was
the
first
to
move
,
and
she
,
wringing
her
hands
,
pursued
her
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
Next
,
Jeremiah
Flintwinch
,
slowly
backing
to
the
door
,
with
one
hand
in
a
pocket
,
and
the
other
rubbing
his
chin
,
twisted
himself
out
in
his
reticent
way
,
speechlessly
.
 
<EOS>
Rigaud
,
left
alone
,
composed
himself
upon
the
window
-
seat
of
the
open
window
,
in
the
old
Marseilles
-
jail
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
laid
his
cigarettes
and
fire
-
box
ready
to
his
hand
,
and
fell
to
smoking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whoof
!
 
<EOS>
Almost
as
dull
as
the
infernal
old
jail
.
 
<EOS>
Warmer
,
but
almost
as
dismal
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
till
she
comes
back
?
 
<EOS>
Yes

certainly
;
but
where
is
she
gone
,
and
how
long
will
she
be
gone
?
 
<EOS>
No
matter

Rigaud
Lagnier
Blandois
,
my
amiable
subject
,
you
will
get
your
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
enrich
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
lived
a
gentleman
;
you
will
die
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
You
triumph
,
my
little
boy
;
but
it
is
your
character
to
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
Whoof
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
the
hour
of
his
triumph
,
his
moustache
went
up
and
his
nose
came
down
,
as
he
ogled
a
great
beam
over
his
head
with
particular
satisfaction
.

Chapter

.
<EOS>
Closed
 
<EOS>
The
sun
had
set
,
and
the
streets
were
dim
in
the
dusty
twilight
,
when
the
figure
so
long
unused
to
them
hurried
on
its
way
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
old
house
it
attracted
little
attention
,
for
there
were
only
a
few
straggling
people
to
notice
it
;
but
,
ascending
from
the
river
by
the
crooked
ways
that
led
to
London
Bridge
,
and
passing
into
the
great
main
road
,
it
became
surrounded
by
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
Resolute
and
wild
of
look
,
rapid
of
foot
and
yet
weak
and
uncertain
,
conspicuously
dressed
in
its
black
garments
and
with
its
hurried
head
-
covering
,
gaunt
and
of
an
unearthly
paleness
<EOS>
,
it
pressed
forward
,
taking
no
more
heed
of
the
throng
than
a
sleep
-
walker
.
<EOS>
More
remarkable
by
being
so
removed
from
the
crowd
it
was
among
than
if
it
had
been
lifted
on
a
pedestal
to
be
seen
,
the
figure
attracted
all
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Saunterers
pricked
up
their
attention
to
observe
it
;
busy
people
,
crossing
it
,
slackened
their
pace
and
turned
their
heads
;
companions
pausing
and
standing
aside
,
whispered
one
another
to
look
at
this
spectral
woman
who
was
coming
by
;
and
the
sweep
of
the
figure
as
it
passed
seemed
to
create
a
vortex
,
drawing
the
most
idle
and
most
curious
after
it
.
   
<EOS>
Made
giddy
by
the
turbulent
irruption
of
this
multitude
of
staring
faces
into
her
cell
of
years
,
by
the
confusing
sensation
of
being
in
the
air
,
and
the
yet
more
confusing
sensation
of
being
afoot
,
by
the
unexpected
changes
in
half
-
remembered
objects
,
and
the
want
of
likeness
between
the
controllable
pictures
her
imagination
had
often
drawn
of
the
life
from
which
she
was
secluded
and
the
overwhelming
rush
of
the
reality
,
she
held
her
way
as
if
she
were
environed
by
distracting
thoughts
,
rather
than
by
external
humanity
and
observation
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
having
crossed
the
bridge
and
gone
some
distance
straight
onward
,
she
remembered
that
she
must
ask
for
a
direction
;
and
it
was
only
then
,
when
she
stopped
and
turned
to
look
about
her
for
a
promising
place
of
inquiry
,
that
she
found
herself
surrounded
by
an
eager
glare
of
faces
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
encircling
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
trembling
.
   
<EOS>
None
of
those
who
were
nearest
answered
;
but
from
the
outer
ring
there
arose
a
shrill
cry
of
"
'Cause
you
're
mad
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
as
sane
as
any
one
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
find
the
Marshalsea
prison
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
shrill
outer
circle
again
retorted
,
"
Then
that
'
ud
show
you
was
mad
if
nothing
else
did
,
'cause
it
's
right
opposite
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
short
,
mild
,
quiet
-
looking
young
man
made
his
way
through
to
her
,
as
a
whooping
ensued
on
this
reply
,
and
said
:
"
Was
it
the
Marshalsea
you
wanted
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
going
on
duty
there
.
 
<EOS>
Come
across
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
he
took
her
over
the
way
;
the
crowd
,
rather
injured
by
the
near
prospect
of
losing
her
,
pressing
before
and
behind
and
on
either
side
,
and
recommending
an
adjournment
to
Bedlam
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
momentary
whirl
in
the
outer
court
-
yard
,
the
prison
-
door
opened
,
and
shut
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Lodge
,
which
seemed
by
contrast
with
the
outer
noise
a
place
of
refuge
and
peace
,
a
yellow
lamp
was
already
striving
with
the
prison
shadows
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
John
!
"
said
the
turnkey
who
admitted
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
father
;
only
this
lady
not
knowing
her
way
,
and
being
badgered
by
the
boys
.
 
<EOS>
Who
did
you
want
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Is
she
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
man
became
more
interested
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
is
here
.
 
<EOS>
What
might
your
name
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Clennam
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Clennam
's
mother
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
She
pressed
her
lips
together
,
and
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
better
be
told
it
is
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
"
the
Marshal
's
family
living
in
the
country
at
present
,
the
Marshal
has
given
Miss
Dorrit
one
of
the
rooms
in
his
house
to
use
when
she
likes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
you
had
better
come
up
there
,
and
let
me
bring
Miss
Dorrit
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
signified
her
assent
,
and
he
unlocked
a
door
and
conducted
her
up
a
side
staircase
into
a
dwelling
-
house
above
.
 
<EOS>
He
showed
her
into
a
darkening
room
,
and
left
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
looked
down
into
the
darkening
prison
-
yard
,
with
its
inmates
strolling
here
and
there
,
leaning
out
of
windows
communing
as
much
apart
as
they
could
with
friends
who
were
going
away
,
and
generally
wearing
out
their
imprisonment
as
they
best
might
that
summer
evening
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
was
heavy
and
hot
;
the
closeness
of
the
place
,
oppressive
;
and
from
without
there
arose
a
rush
of
free
sounds
,
like
the
jarring
memory
of
such
things
in
a
headache
and
heartache
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
at
the
window
,
bewildered
,
looking
down
into
this
prison
as
it
were
out
of
her
own
different
prison
,
when
a
soft
word
or
two
of
surprise
made
her
start
,
and
Little
Dorrit
stood
before
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
,
Mrs
Clennam
,
that
you
are
so
happily
recovered
as
---
"
   
Little
Dorrit
stopped
,
for
there
was
neither
happiness
nor
health
in
the
face
that
turned
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
recovery
;
it
is
not
strength
;
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
an
agitated
wave
of
her
hand
,
she
put
all
that
aside
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
packet
left
with
you
which
you
were
to
give
to
Arthur
,
if
it
was
not
reclaimed
before
this
place
closed
to
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
reclaim
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
took
it
from
her
bosom
,
and
gave
it
into
her
hand
,
which
remained
stretched
out
after
receiving
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
idea
of
its
contents
?
"
   
<EOS>
Frightened
by
her
being
there
with
that
new
power
Of
Movement
in
her
,
which
,
as
she
said
herself
,
was
not
strength
,
and
which
was
unreal
to
look
upon
,
as
though
a
picture
or
statue
had
been
animated
,
Little
Dorrit
answered
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Read
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
took
the
packet
from
the
still
outstretched
hand
,
and
broke
the
seal
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
then
gave
her
the
inner
packet
that
was
addressed
to
herself
,
and
held
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
shadow
of
the
wall
and
of
the
prison
buildings
,
which
made
the
room
sombre
at
noon
,
made
it
too
dark
to
read
there
,
with
the
dusk
deepening
apace
,
save
in
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
window
,
where
a
little
of
the
bright
summer
evening
sky
could
shine
upon
her
,
Little
Dorrit
stood
,
and
read
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
broken
exclamation
or
so
of
wonder
and
of
terror
,
she
read
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
finished
,
she
looked
round
,
and
her
old
mistress
bowed
herself
before
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
now
,
what
I
have
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
so
;
though
my
mind
is
so
hurried
,
and
so
sorry
,
and
has
so
much
to
pity
that
it
has
not
been
able
to
follow
all
I
have
read
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
tremulously
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
restore
to
you
what
I
have
withheld
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
.
<EOS>
Can
you
forgive
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
and
Heaven
knows
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
Do
not
kiss
my
dress
and
kneel
to
me
;
you
are
too
old
to
kneel
to
me
;
I
forgive
you
freely
without
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
more
yet
to
ask
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
in
that
posture
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
unnatural
to
see
your
grey
hair
lower
than
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
rise
;
let
me
help
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
she
raised
her
up
,
and
stood
rather
shrinking
from
her
,
but
looking
at
her
earnestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
great
petition
that
I
make
to
you
<EOS>
(
there
is
another
which
grows
out
of
it
)
,
<EOS>
the
great
supplication
that
I
address
to
your
merciful
and
gentle
heart
,
is
,
that
you
will
not
disclose
this
to
Arthur
until
I
am
dead
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
think
,
when
you
have
had
time
for
consideration
,
that
it
can
do
him
any
good
to
know
it
while
I
am
yet
alive
,
then
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
will
not
think
that
;
and
in
such
case
,
will
you
promise
me
to
spare
me
until
I
am
dead
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
sorry
,
and
what
I
have
read
has
<EOS>
so
confused
my
thoughts
,
"
returned
Little
Dorrit
,
"
that
I
can
scarcely
give
you
a
steady
answer
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
should
be
quite
sure
that
to
be
acquainted
with
it
will
do
Mr
Clennam
<EOS>
no
good
---
"
   
"
I
know
you
are
attached
to
him
,
and
will
make
him
the
first
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
right
that
he
should
be
the
first
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
having
regarded
him
,
and
still
finding
that
you
may
spare
me
for
the
little
time
I
shall
remain
on
earth
,
will
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
GOD
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
stood
in
the
shadow
so
that
she
was
only
a
veiled
form
to
Little
Dorrit
in
the
light
;
but
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
in
saying
those
three
grateful
words
,
was
at
once
fervent
and
broken
---
broken
by
emotion
as
unfamiliar
to
her
frozen
eyes
as
action
to
her
frozen
limbs
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
,
perhaps
,
"
she
said
in
a
stronger
tone
,
"
that
I
can
better
bear
to
be
known
to
you
whom
I
have
wronged
,
than
to
the
son
of
my
enemy
who
wronged
me
.
<EOS>
---
For
she
did
wrong
me
!
 
<EOS>
She
not
only
sinned
grievously
against
the
Lord
,
but
she
wronged
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
Arthur
's
father
was
to
me
,
she
made
him
.
 
<EOS>
From
our
marriage
day
I
was
his
dread
,
and
that
she
made
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
the
scourge
of
both
,
and
that
is
referable
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
love
Arthur
<EOS>
(
I
can
see
the
blush
upon
your
face
;
may
it
be
the
dawn
of
happier
days
to
both
of
you
!
)
,
and
you
will
have
thought
already
that
he
is
as
merciful
and
kind
as
you
,
and
why
do
I
not
trust
myself
to
him
as
soon
as
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
not
thought
so
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
thought
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
can
be
quite
a
stranger
to
my
heart
,
that
springs
out
of
the
knowledge
that
Mr
Clennam
is
always
to
be
relied
upon
for
being
kind
and
generous
and
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
it
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
Arthur
is
,
of
the
whole
world
,
the
one
person
from
whom
I
would
conceal
this
,
while
I
am
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
kept
over
him
as
a
child
,
in
the
days
of
his
first
remembrance
,
my
restraining
and
correcting
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
stern
with
him
,
knowing
that
the
transgressions
of
the
parents
are
visited
on
their
offspring
,
and
that
there
was
an
angry
mark
upon
him
at
his
birth
.
<EOS>
I
have
sat
with
him
and
his
father
,
seeing
the
weakness
of
his
father
yearning
to
unbend
to
him
;
and
forcing
it
back
,
that
the
child
might
work
out
his
release
in
bondage
and
hardship
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
,
with
his
mother
's
face
,
looking
up
at
me
in
awe
from
his
little
books
,
and
trying
to
soften
me
with
his
mother
's
ways
that
hardened
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
shrinking
of
her
auditress
stopped
her
for
a
moment
in
her
flow
of
words
,
delivered
in
a
retrospective
gloomy
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
his
good
.
 
<EOS>
Not
for
the
satisfaction
of
my
injury
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
I
,
and
what
was
the
worth
of
that
,
before
the
curse
of
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
that
child
grow
up
;
not
to
be
pious
in
a
chosen
way
(
his
mother
's
influence
lay
too
heavy
on
him
for
that
)
,
but
still
to
be
just
and
upright
,
and
to
be
submissive
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
loved
me
,
as
I
once
half
-
hoped
he
might
---
<EOS>
so
frail
we
are
,
and
so
do
the
corrupt
affections
of
the
flesh
war
with
our
trusts
and
tasks
;
but
he
always
respected
me
and
ordered
himself
dutifully
to

He
does
to
this
hour

<EOS>
With
an
empty
place
in
his
heart
that
he
has
never
known
the
meaning
of
,
he
has
turned
away
from
me
and
gone
his
separate
road
;
but
even
that
he
has
done
considerately
and
with
deference
.
 
<EOS>
These
have
been
his
relations
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yours
have
been
of
a
much
slighter
kind
,
spread
over
a
much
shorter
time
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
sat
at
your
needle
in
my
room
,
you
have
been
in
fear
of
me
,
but
you
have
supposed
me
to
have
been
doing
you
a
kindness
;
you
are
better
informed
now
,
and
know
me
to
have
done
you
an
injury
.
 
<EOS>
Your
misconstruction
and
misunderstanding
of
the
cause
in
which
,
and
the
motives
with
which
,
I
have
worked
out
this
work
,
is
lighter
to
endure
than
his
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
for
any
worldly
recompense
I
can
imagine
,
have
him
in
a
moment
,
however
blindly
,
throw
me
down
from
the
station
I
have
held
before
him
all
his
life
,
and
change
me
altogether
into
something
he
would
cast
out
of
his
respect
,
and
think
detected
and
exposed
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
do
it
,
if
it
must
be
done
,
when
I
am
not
here
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
never
feel
,
while
I
am
still
alive
,
that
I
die
before
his
face
,
and
utterly
perish
away
from
him
,
like
one
consumed
by
lightning
and
swallowed
by
an
earthquake
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
pride
was
very
strong
in
her
,
the
pain
of
it
and
of
her
old
passions
was
very
sharp
with
her
,
when
she
thus
expressed
herself
.
<EOS>
Not
less
so
,
when
she
added
:
   
"
Even
now
,
I
see
YOU
shrink
from
me
,
as
if
I
had
been
cruel
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
could
not
gainsay
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
tried
not
to
show
it
,
but
she
recoiled
with
dread
from
the
state
of
mind
that
had
burnt
so
fiercely
and
lasted
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
It
presented
itself
to
her
,
with
no
sophistry
upon
it
,
in
its
own
plain
nature
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
done

"
said
Mrs
Clennam
,
"
what
it
was
given
to
me
to
do

I
have
set
myself
against
evil

been

sin

Little

Even

my

prevailed

could
I

found
no
justification

<EOS>
None
in
the
old
days

the
innocent
perished
with
the
guilty
,
a
thousand
to
one

<EOS>
When
the
wrath
of
the
hater
of
the
unrighteous
was
not
slaked
even
in
blood

found
favour

"
O
,
Mrs
Clennam
,
Mrs
Clennam

"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
"
angry
feelings
and
unforgiving
deeds
are
no
comfort

no
guide

you

<EOS>
My
life
has
been
passed
in
this
poor
prison

and
my
teaching
has
been
very
defective
;
but
let
me
implore
you
to
remember
later
and
better
days
.
 
<EOS>
Be
guided
only
by
the
healer
of
the
sick
,
the
raiser
of
the
dead
,
the
friend
of
all
who
were
afflicted
and
forlorn
,
the
patient
Master
who
shed
tears
of
compassion
for
our
infirmities

<EOS>
We
can
not
but
be
right
if
we
put
all
the
rest
away
,
and
do
everything
in
remembrance
of
Him
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
vengeance
and
no
infliction
of
suffering
in
His
life

I
am
sure
.

There
can
be
no
confusion
in
following
Him

seeking
for
no
other
footsteps

I
am
certain

<EOS>
In
the
softened
light
of
the
window
,
looking
from
the
scene
of
her
early
trials
to
the
shining
sky
,
she
was
not
in
stronger
opposition
to
the
black
figure
in
the
shade
than
the
life
and
doctrine
on
which
she
rested
<EOS>
were
to
that
figure

history

<EOS>
It
bent
its
head
low
again
,
and
said
not
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
It
remained
thus
,
until
the
first
warning
bell
began
to
ring
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
cried
Mrs
Clennam
starting
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
I
had
another
petition
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
one
that
does
not
admit
of
delay
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
who
brought
you
this
packet

possesses
these
proofs

is
now
waiting
at
my
house
to
be
bought
off

<EOS>
I
can
keep
this
from
Arthur
,
only
by
buying
him
off

<EOS>
He
asks
a
large
sum
;
more
than
I
can
get
together
to
pay
him
without
having
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
refuses
to
make
any
abatement
,
because
his
threat
is
,
that
if
he
fails
with
me
,
he
will
come
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
return
with
me
and
show
him
that

Will
you

Will
you

Do
not
refuse
what
I
ask
in
Arthur

name
,
though
I
dare
not
ask
it
for
Arthur
's
sake

"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
yielded
willingly
.
 
<EOS>
She
glided
away
into
the
prison
for
a
few
moments
,
returned
,
and
said
she
was
ready
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
out
by
another
staircase
,
avoiding
the
lodge
;
and
coming
into
the
front
court
-
yard
,
now
all
quiet
and
deserted
,
gained
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
summer
evenings
when
there
is
no
greater
darkness
than
a
long
twilight
.
 
<EOS>
The
vista
of
street
and
bridge
was
plain
to
see
,
and
the
sky
was
serene
and
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
People
stood
and
sat
at
their
doors
,
playing
with
children
and
enjoying
the
evening
;
numbers
were
walking
for
air
;
the
worry
of
the
day
had
almost
worried
itself
out
,
and
few
but
themselves
were
hurried
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
crossed
the
bridge
,
the
clear
steeples
of
the
many
churches
looked
as
if
they
had
advanced
out
of
the
murk
that
usually
enshrouded
them
,
and
come
much
nearer
.
 
<EOS>
The
smoke
that
rose
into
the
sky
had
lost
its
dingy
hue
and
taken
a
brightness
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
beauties
of
the
sunset
had
not
faded
from
the
long
light
films
of
cloud
that
lay
at
peace
in
the
horizon
.
 
<EOS>
From
a
radiant
centre
,
over
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
the
tranquil
firmament
,
great
shoots
of
light
streamed
among
the
early
stars
,
like
signs
of
the
blessed
later
covenant
of
peace
and
hope
that
changed
the
crown
of
thorns
into
a
glory
.
   
<EOS>
Less
remarkable
,
now
that
she
was
not
alone
and
it
was
darker
,
Mrs
Clennam
hurried
on
at
Little
Dorrit
's
side
,
unmolested
.
 
<EOS>
They
left
the
great
thoroughfare
at
the
turning
by
which
she
had
entered
it
,
and
wound
their
way
down
among
the
silent
,
empty
,
cross
-
streets
.
<EOS>
Their
feet
were
at
the
gateway
,
when
there
was
a
sudden
noise
like
thunder
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
that
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
make
haste
in
,
"
cried
Mrs
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
in
the
gateway
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
with
a
piercing
cry
,
held
her
back
.
   
<EOS>
In
one
swift
instant
the
old
house
was
before
them
,
with
the
man
lying
smoking
in
the
window
;
another
thundering
sound
,
and
it
heaved
,
surged
outward
,
opened
asunder
in
fifty
places
,
collapsed
,
and
fell
.
 
<EOS>
Deafened
by
the
noise
,
stifled
,
choked
,
and
blinded
by
the
dust
,
they
hid
their
faces
and
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
The
dust
storm
,
driving
between
them
and
the
placid
sky
,
parted
for
a
moment
and
showed
them
the
stars
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
looked
up
,
wildly
crying
for
help
,
the
great
pile
of
chimneys
,
which
was
then
alone
left
standing
like
a
tower
in
a
whirlwind
,
rocked
,
broke
,
and
hailed
itself
down
upon
the
heap
of
ruin
,
as
if
every
tumbling
fragment
were
intent
on
burying
the
crushed
wretch
deeper
.
   
<EOS>
So
blackened
by
the
flying
particles
of
rubbish
as
to
be
unrecognisable
,
they
ran
back
from
the
gateway
into
the
street
,
crying
and
shrieking
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
Mrs
Clennam
dropped
upon
the
stones
;
and
she
never
from
that
hour
moved
so
much
as
a
finger
again
,
or
had
the
power
to
speak
one
word
.
 
<EOS>
For
upwards
of
three
years
she
reclined
in
a
wheeled
chair
,
looking
attentively
at
those
about
her
and
appearing
to
understand
what
they
said
;
but
the
rigid
silence
she
had
so
long
held
was
evermore
enforced
upon
her
,
and
except
that
she
could
move
her
eyes
and
faintly
express
a
negative
and
affirmative
with
her
head
,
she
lived
and
died
a
statue
.
   
<EOS>
Affery
had
been
looking
for
them
at
the
prison
,
and
had
caught
sight
of
them
at
a
distance
on
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
up
to
receive
her
old
mistress
in
her
arms
,
to
help
to
carry
her
into
a
neighbouring
house
,
and
to
be
faithful
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
mystery
of
the
noises
was
out
now
;
Affery
,
like
greater
people
,
had
always
been
right
in
her
facts
,
and
always
wrong
in
the
theories
she
deduced
from
them
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
storm
of
dust
had
cleared
away
and
the
summer
night
was
calm
again
,
numbers
of
people
choked
up
every
avenue
of
access
,
and
parties
of
diggers
were
formed
to
relieve
one
another
in
digging
among
the
ruins
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
hundred
people
in
the
house
at
the
time
of
its
fall
,
there
had
been
fifty
,
there
had
been
fifteen
,
there
had
been
two
.
 
<EOS>
Rumour
finally
settled
the
number
at
two
;
the
foreigner
and
Mr
Flintwinch
.
<EOS>
The
diggers
dug
all
through
the
short
night
by
flaring
pipes
of
gas
,
and
on
a
level
with
the
early
sun
,
and
deeper
and
deeper
below
it
as
it
rose
into
its
zenith
,
and
aslant
of
it
as
it
declined
,
and
on
a
level
with
it
again
as
it
departed
.
 
<EOS>
Sturdy
digging
,
and
shovelling
,
and
carrying
away
,
in
carts
,
barrows
,
and
baskets
,
went
on
without
intermission
,
by
night
and
by
day
;
but
it
was
night
for
the
second
time
when
they
found
the
dirty
heap
of
rubbish
that
had
been
the
foreigner
before
his
head
had
been
shivered
to
atoms
,
like
so
much
glass
,
by
the
great
beam
that
lay
upon
him
,
crushing
him
.
   
<EOS>
Still
,
they
had
not
come
upon
Flintwinch
yet
;
so
the
sturdy
digging
and
shovelling
and
carrying
away
went
on
without
intermission
by
night
and
by
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
got
about
that
the
old
house
had
had
famous
cellarage
(
which
indeed
was
true
)
,
and
that
Flintwinch
had
been
in
a
cellar
at
the
moment
,
or
had
had
time
to
escape
into
one
,
and
that
he
was
safe
under
its
strong
arch
,
and
even
that
he
had
been
heard
to
cry
,
in
hollow
,
subterranean
,
suffocated
notes
,
"
Here
I
am
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
town
it
was
even
known
that
the
excavators
had
been
able
to
open
a
communication
with
him
through
a
pipe
,
and
that
he
had
received
both
soup
and
brandy
by
that
channel
,
and
that
he
had
said
with
admirable
fortitude
that
he
was
All
right
,
my
lads
,
with
the
exception
of
his
collar
-
bone
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
digging
and
shovelling
and
carrying
away
went
on
without
intermission
,
until
the
ruins
were
all
dug
out
,
and
the
cellars
opened
to
the
light
;
and
still
no
Flintwinch
,
living
or
dead
,
all
right
or
all
wrong
,
had
been
turned
up
by
pick
or
spade
.
   
<EOS>
It
began
then
to
be
perceived
that
Flintwinch
had
not
been
there
at
the
time
of
the
fall
;
and
it
began
then
to
be
perceived
that
he
had
been
rather
busy
elsewhere
,
converting
securities
into
as
much
money
as
could
be
got
for
them
on
the
shortest
notice
,
and
turning
to
his
own
exclusive
account
his
authority
to
act
for
the
Firm
.
<EOS>
Affery
,
remembering
that
the
clever
one
had
said
he
would
explain
himself
further
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
'
time
,
determined
for
her
part
that
his
taking
himself
off
within
that
period
with
all
he
could
get
,
was
the
final
satisfactory
sum
and
substance
of
his
promised
explanation
;
but
she
held
her
peace
,
devoutly
thankful
to
be
quit
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
seemed
reasonable
to
conclude
that
a
man
who
had
never
been
buried
could
not
be
unburied
,
the
diggers
gave
him
up
when
their
task
was
done
,
and
did
not
dig
down
for
him
into
the
depths
of
the
earth
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
taken
in
ill
part
by
a
great
many
people
,
who
persisted
in
believing
that
Flintwinch
was
lying
somewhere
among
the
London
geological
formation
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
their
belief
much
shaken
by
repeated
intelligence
which
came
over
in
course
of
time
,
that
an
old
man
who
wore
the
tie
of
his
neckcloth
under
one
ear
,
and
who
was
very
well
known
to
be
an
Englishman
,
consorted
with
the
Dutchmen
on
the
quaint
banks
of
the
canals
of
the
Hague
and
in
the
drinking
-
shops
of
Amsterdam
,
under
the
style
and
designation
of
Mynheer
von
Flyntevynge

Going
 
Arthur

to

very
ill

Marshalsea

Mr
Rugg
descrying
no

affording

Mr

If
it

for

infallible
figures

proved
that
Arthur
,
instead
of
pining
in
imprisonment

ought

be
promenading
in
a
carriage

pair

and
that
Mr
Pancks
,
instead
of
being
restricted

his
clerkly
wages

ought
to
have
from
three
to
five
thousand
pounds
of
his
own
at
his
immediate
disposal

that
unhappy
arithmetician
would
probably
have
taken
to
his
bed
,
and
there
have
made
one
of
the
many
obscure
persons
who
turned
their
faces
to
the
wall
and
died
,
as
a
last
sacrifice
to
the
late
Mr
Merdle
's
greatness
.
 
<EOS>
Solely
supported
by
his
unimpugnable
calculations
,
Mr
Pancks
led
an
unhappy
and
restless
life
;
constantly
carrying
his
figures
about
with
him
in
his
hat
,
and
not
only
going
over
them
himself
on
every
possible
occasion
,
but
entreating
every
human
being
he
could
lay
hold
of
to
go
over
them
with
him
,
and
observe
what
a
clear
case
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Down
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
<EOS>
there
was
scarcely
an
inhabitant
of
note
to
whom
Mr
Pancks
had
not
imparted
his
demonstration
,
and
,
as
figures
are
catching
,
a
kind
of
cyphering
measles
broke
out
in
that
locality
,
under
the
influence
of
which
the
whole
Yard
was
light
-
headed
.
   
<EOS>
The
more
restless
Mr
Pancks
grew
in
his
mind
,
the
more
impatient
he
became
of
the
Patriarch
.
 
<EOS>
In
their
later
conferences
his
snorting
assumed
an
irritable
sound
which
boded
the
Patriarch
no
good
;
likewise
,
Mr
Pancks
had
on
several
occasions
looked
harder
at
the
Patriarchal
bumps
than
was
quite
reconcilable
with
the
fact
of
his
not
being
a
painter
,
or
a
peruke
-
maker
in
search
of
the
living
model
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
he
steamed
in
and
out
of
his
little
back
Dock
according
as
he
was
wanted
or
not
wanted
in
the
Patriarchal
presence
,
and
business
had
gone
on
in
its
customary
course
.
 
<EOS>
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
had
been
harrowed
by
Mr
Pancks
,
and
cropped
by
Mr
Casby
,
at
the
regular
seasons
;
Mr
Pancks
had
taken
all
the
drudgery
and
all
the
dirt
of
the
business
as
his
share
;
Mr
Casby
had
taken
all
the
profits
,
all
the
ethereal
vapour
,
and
all
the
moonshine
,
as
his
share
;
and
,
in
the
form
of
words
which
that
benevolent
beamer
generally
employed
on
Saturday
evenings
,
when
he
twirled
his
fat
thumbs
after
striking
the
week
's
balance
,
"
everything
had
been
satisfactory
to
all
parties
---
all
parties
---
satisfactory
,
sir
,
to
all
parties
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Dock
of
the
Steam
-
Tug
,
Pancks
,
had
a
leaden
roof
,
which
,
frying
in
the
very
hot
sunshine
,
may
have
heated
the
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
one
glowing
Saturday
evening
,
on
being
hailed
by
the
lumbering
bottle
-
green
ship
,
the
Tug
instantly
came
working
out
of
the
Dock
in
a
highly
heated
condition
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
"
was
the
Patriarchal
remark
,
"
you
have
been
remiss
,
you
have
been
remiss
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
was
the
short
rejoinder
.
   
<EOS>
The
Patriarchal
state
,
always
a
state
of
calmness
and
composure
,
was
so
particularly
serene
that
evening
as
to
be
provoking
.
<EOS>
Everybody
else
within
the
bills
of
mortality
was
hot
;
but
the
Patriarch
was
perfectly
cool
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
was
thirsty
,
and
the
Patriarch
was
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fragrance
of
limes
or
lemons
about
him
;
and
he
made
a
drink
of
golden
sherry
,
which
shone
in
a
large
tumbler
as
if
he
were
drinking
the
evening
sunshine
.
 
<EOS>
this
was
bad
,
but
not
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
was
,
that
with
his
big
blue
eyes
,
and
his
polished
head
,
and
his
long
white
hair
,
and
his
bottle
-
green
legs
stretched
out
before
him
,
terminating
in
his
easy
shoes
easily
crossed
at
the
instep
,
he
had
a
radiant
appearance
of
having
in
his
extensive
benevolence
made
the
drink
for
the
human
species
,
while
he
himself
wanted
nothing
but
his
own
milk
of
human
kindness
.
   
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
Mr
Pancks
said
,
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
and
put
his
hair
up
with
both
hands
,
in
a
highly
portentous
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
Mr
Pancks
,
that
you
must
be
sharper
with
the
people
,
sharper
with
the
people
,
much
sharper
with
the
people
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
Your

not
up

<EOS>
You
must
squeeze
them
,
sir
,
or
our
connection
will
not
continue
to
be
as
satisfactory
as
I
could
wish
it
to
be
to
all
parties
.
 
<EOS>
All
parties
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
squeeze
'
em

"
retorted
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
else
am
I
made
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
made
for
nothing
else
,
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
made
to
do
your
duty
,
but
you
do
n't
do
your
duty

<EOS>
You
are
paid
to
squeeze
,
and
you
must
squeeze

"
 
<EOS>
The
Patriarch
so
much
surprised
himself
by
this
brilliant
turn
,
after
Dr
Johnson
,
which
he
had
not
in
the
least
expected
or
intended
,
that
he
laughed
aloud
;
and
repeated
with
great
satisfaction
,
as
he
twirled
his
thumbs
and
nodded
at
his
youthful
portrait
,
"
Paid
to
squeeze
,
sir
,
and
must
squeeze
to
pay
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

yes

Something

<EOS>
You

,
Mr

,
to
squeeze
the
Yard
again
,
the
first
thing
on
Monday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
that
too
soon

<EOS>
I
squeezed
it
dry
to

day

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense

<EOS>
Not

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

"
said
Pancks
,
watching
him
as
he
benevolently
gulped
down
a
good
draught
of
his
mixture
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir

yes

<EOS>
I
am
not

Mr
Pancks

with
my

not
at
all

<EOS>
Besides
calling
much
too
often
to
inquire
for
Mrs
Clennam
,
Mrs
Clennam
,
who
is
not
just
now
in
circumstances
that
are
by
any
means
calculated

be

she
goes
,
Mr

unless

am
much

to
inquire
for

<EOS>
In

"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
laid

said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh

Mr

<EOS>
She

nothing

nothing

Let

"
   
<EOS>
Although
Mr
Pancks
's
hair
was
standing
up
like
strong
wire
,
he
gave
it
another
double
-
handed
impulse
in
the
perpendicular
direction
,
and
smiled
at
his
proprietor
in
a
most
hideous
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
please
to
mention
to
my
daughter
,
Mr
Pancks
,
that
I
ca
n't
allow

"
said
the
Patriarch
blandly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
mention
it
yourself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
<EOS>
no
;
you
are
paid
to
mention
it
<EOS>
,
"
the
blundering
old
booby
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
trying
it
again
,
"
and
you
must
mention
it
to
pay
,
mention
it

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

"
said
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
,
Mr
Pancks
,
that
you
yourself
are
too
often
and
too
much
in
that
direction
,
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
I
recommend
you
,
Mr
Pancks
,
to
dismiss
from
your
attention
both
your
own
losses
and
other
people
's
losses
,
and
to
mind
your
business
,
mind
your
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
acknowledged
this
recommendation
with
such
an
extraordinarily
abrupt
,
short
,
and
loud
utterance
of
the
monosyllable
"
Oh
!
"
that
even
the
unwieldy
Patriarch
moved
his
blue
eyes
in
something
of
a
hurry
,
to
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
with
a
sniff
of
corresponding
intensity
,
then
added
,
"
Anything
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
present
,
sir
,
not
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
,
"
said
the
Patriarch
,
finishing
his
mixture
,
and
rising
with
an
amiable
air
,
"
to
take
a
little
stroll
,
a
little
stroll
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
shall
find
you
here
when
I
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
If
not
,
sir
,
duty
,
duty

squeeze
,
squeeze
,
squeeze
,
on
Monday

squeeze
on
Monday

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
after
another
stiffening
of
his
hair
,
looked
on
at
the
Patriarchal
assumption
of
the
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
with
a
momentary
appearance
of
indecision
contending
with
a
sense
of
injury
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
also
hotter
than
at
first
,
and
breathed
harder
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
suffered
Mr
Casby
to
go
out
,
without
offering
any
further
remark
,
and
then
took
a
peep
at
him
over
the
little
green
window
-
blinds
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
,
"
he
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
where
you
were
bound
to
.
 
<EOS>
Good
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
steamed
back
to
his
Dock
,
put
it
carefully
in
order
,
took
down
his
hat
,
looked
round
the
Dock
,
<EOS>
said
"
Good
-
bye
!
"
and
puffed
away
on
his
own
account
.
 
<EOS>
He
steered
straight
for
Mrs
Plornish
's
end
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
and
arrived
there
,
at
the
top
of
the
steps
,
hotter
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
top
of
the
steps
,
resisting
Mrs
Plornish
's
invitations
to
come
and
sit
along
with
father
in
Happy
Cottage
---
which
to
his
relief
were
not
so
numerous
as
they
would
have
been
on
any
other
night
than
Saturday
,
when
the
connection
who
so
gallantly
supported
the
business
with
everything
but
money
gave
their
orders
freely
---
at
the
top
of
the
steps
Mr
Pancks
remained
until
he
beheld
the
Patriarch
,
who
always
entered
the
Yard
at
the
other
end
,
slowly
advancing
,
beaming
,
and
surrounded
by
suitors
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Pancks
descended
and
bore
down
upon
him
,
with
his
utmost
pressure
of
steam
on
.
   
<EOS>
The
Patriarch
,
approaching
with
his
usual
benignity
,
was
surprised
to
see
Mr
Pancks
,
but
supposed
him
to
have
been
stimulated
to
an
immediate
squeeze
instead
of
postponing
that
operation
until
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
The
population
of
the
Yard
were
astonished
at
the
meeting
,
for
the
two
powers
had
never
been
seen
there
together
,
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
Bleeding
Heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
overcome
by
unutterable
amazement
when
Mr
Pancks
,
going
close
up
to
the
most
venerable
of
men
and
halting
in
front
of
the
bottle
-
green
waistcoat
,
made
a
trigger
of
his
right
thumb
and
forefinger
,
applied
the
same
to
the
brim
of
the
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
and
,
with
singular
smartness
and
precision
,
shot
it
off
the
polished
head
as
if
it
had
been
a
large
marble
.
   
<EOS>
Having
taken
this
little
liberty
with
the
Patriarchal
person
,
Mr
Pancks
further
astounded
and
attracted
the
Bleeding
Hearts
by
saying
in
an
audible
voice
,
"
Now
,
you
sugary
swindler
,
I
mean
to
have
it
out
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
and
the
Patriarch
were
instantly
the
centre
of
a
press
,
all
eyes
and
ears
;
windows
were
thrown
open
,
and
door
-
steps
were
thronged
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
pretend
to
be
?
"
said
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
moral
game
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
go
in
for
?
 
<EOS>
Benevolence
,
an't
it
?
 
<EOS>
You
benevolent
!
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pancks
,
apparently
without
the
intention
of
hitting
him
,
but
merely
to
relieve
his
mind
and
expend
his
superfluous
power
in
wholesome
exercise
,
aimed
a
blow
at
the
bumpy
head
,
which
the
bumpy
head
ducked
to
avoid
.
 
<EOS>
This
singular
performance
was
repeated
,
to
the
ever
-
increasing
admiration
of
the
spectators
,
at
the
end
of
every
succeeding
article
of
Mr
Pancks
's
oration
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
discharged
myself
from
your
service
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
that
I
may
tell
you
what
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
one
of
a
lot
of
impostors
that
are
the
worst
lot
of
all
the
lots
to
be
met
with
.
 
<EOS>
Speaking
as
a
sufferer
by
both
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
that
I
would
n't
as
soon
have
the
Merdle
lot
as
your
lot
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
driver
in
disguise
,
a
screwer
by
deputy
,
a
wringer
,
and
squeezer
,
and
shaver
by
substitute
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
philanthropic
sneak
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
shabby
deceiver
!
"
<EOS>
(
The
repetition
of
the
performance
at
this
point
was
received
with
a
burst
of
laughter
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
these
good
people
who
's
the
hard
man
here
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
tell
you
Pancks

I
believe

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
confirmed
with
cries
of
"
Certainly
,
"
and
"
Hear

"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
you

This

Pancks

"
If

"
Good

cried
several
voices
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear

<EOS>
"
Hear

<EOS>
cried
that
gentleman
(
after
repeating
the
popular
performance
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes

think
so

It

almost
time
to
hear
Mr
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
has
come
down
into
the
Yard
to
-
night
on
purpose
that
you
should
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
Pancks
is
only
the
Works
;
but
here
's
the
Winder
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
audience
would
have
gone
over
to
Mr
Pancks
,
as
one
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
but
for
the
long
,
grey
,
silken
locks
,
and
the
broad
-
brimmed
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
Stop
,
"
said
Pancks
,
"
that
sets
the
tune
to
be
ground
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
but
one
tune
,
and
its
name
is
Grind
,
Grind
,
Grind
!
<EOS>
Here
's
the
Proprietor
,
and
here
's
his
Grubber
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
good
people
,
when
he
comes
smoothly
spinning
through
the
Yard
to
-
night
,
like
a
slow
-
going
benevolent
Humming
-
Top
,
and
when
you
come
about
him
with
your
complaints
of
the
Grubber
,
you
do
n't
know
what
a
cheat
the
Proprietor
is
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
his
showing
himself
to
-
night
,
that
I
may
have
all
the
blame
on
Monday
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
his
having
had
me
over
the
coals
this
very
evening
,
because
I
do
n't
squeeze
you
enough
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
my
being
,
at
the
present
moment
,
under
special
orders
to
squeeze
you
dry
on
Monday
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
reply
was
given
in
a
murmur
of
"
Shame
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
Shabby
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shabby
?
"
snorted
Pancks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
should
think
so
!
 
<EOS>
The
lot
that
your
Casby
belongs
to
,
is
the
shabbiest
of
all
the
lots
.
 
<EOS>
Setting
their
Grubbers
on
,
at
a
wretched
pittance
,
to
do
what
they
're
ashamed
and
afraid
to
do
and
pretend
not
to
do
,
but
what
they
will
have
done
,
or
give
a
man
no
rest
!
 
<EOS>
Imposing
on
you
to
give
their
Grubbers
nothing
but
blame
,
and
to
give
them
nothing
but
credit
!
<EOS>
Why
,
the
worst
-
looking
cheat
in
all
this
town
who
gets
the
value
of
eighteenpence
under
false
pretences
,
an't
half
such
a
cheat
as
this
sign
-
post
of
The
Casby
's
Head
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
Cries
of
"
That
's
true

"
<EOS>
and
"
No
more
he
an't
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
see
what
you
get
of
these
fellows
,
besides
,
"
said
Pancks
.
<EOS>
"
See
what
more
you
get
of
these
precious
Humming
-
Tops
,
revolving
among
you
with
such
smoothness
that
you
've
no
idea
of
the
pattern
painted
on
'em
,

the
little
window
in
'em

<EOS>
I
wish
to
call
your
attention
to
myself
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I

an
agreeable

<EOS>
,
I
know
that
very
well

"
   
<EOS>
The
auditory
were
divided
on
this
point
;
its
more
uncompromising
members
crying
,
"
No
,
you
are
not
,
"
and
its
politer
materials
,
"
Yes
,
you
are

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
in

,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
"
a
dry
,
uncomfortable
,
dreary
Plodder

Grubber

<EOS>
That
's
your
humble
servant

<EOS>
There
's
his
full

length
portrait

painted
by
himself

<EOS>
But
what
's
a
man
to
be
,
with
such
a
man
as
this
for
his
Proprietor
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
be
expected
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
Did
anybody
ever
find
boiled
mutton
and
caper
-
sauce
growing
in
a
cocoa

nut
?
"
   
<EOS>
None
of
the
Bleeding
Hearts
ever
had
,
it
was
clear
from
the
alacrity
of
their
response
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
"
and
neither
will
you
find
in
Grubbers
like
myself
,
under
Proprietors

this

pleasant
qualities

<EOS>
I
've
been
a

What

my

<EOS>
Fag

I

been
agreeable

I
have
n't
been
likely
to
be

<EOS>
If
I
was
a
shilling
a
week
less
useful
in
ten
years

time
,
this
impostor
would
give
me
a

if

cheaper

It
's
a
mighty
fine
sign
-
post
,
is
The
Casby
's
Head
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
surveying
it
with
anything
rather
than
admiration
;
"
but
the
real
name
of
the
House
is
the
Sham

Arms

<EOS>
Its
motto
is
,
Keep

<EOS>
Is
any

present

"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
breaking
off
and
looking
round
,
"
acquainted
with
the
English
Grammar
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
was
shy
of
claiming
that
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
matter
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
"
I
merely
wish
to
remark
that
the
task
this
Proprietor
has
set
me
,
has
been
never
to
leave
off
conjugating
the
Imperative
Mood
Present
Tense
of
the
verb
To

<EOS>
Keep

Here
is
your
benevolent
Patriarch
of
a
Casby
,
and
there
is
his
golden
rule
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
uncommonly
improving
to
look
at
,
and
I
am
not
at
all
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
as
sweet
as
honey
,
and
I
am
as
dull
as
ditch
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
He
provides
the
pitch
,
and
I
handle
it
,
and
it
sticks
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Pancks
,
closing
upon
his
late
Proprietor
again
,
from
whom
he
had
withdrawn
a
little
for
the
better
display
of
him
to
the
Yard
;
"
as
I
am
not
accustomed
to
speak
in
public
,
and
as
I
have
made
a
rather
lengthy
speech
,
all
circumstances
considered
,
I
shall
bring
my
observations
to
a
close
by
requesting
you
to
get
out
of
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Last
of
the
Patriarchs
had
been
so
seized
by
assault
,
and
required
so
much
room
to
catch
an
idea
in
,
an
so
much
more
room
to
turn
it
in
,
that
he
had
not
a
word
to
offer
in
reply
.
 
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
be
meditating
some
Patriarchal
way
out
of
his
delicate
position
,
when
Mr
Pancks
,
once
more
suddenly
applying
the
trigger
to
his
hat
,
shot
it
off
again
with
his
former
dexterity
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
preceding
occasion
,
one
or
two
of
the
Bleeding
Heart
Yarders
had
obsequiously
picked
it
up
and
handed
it
to
its
owner
;
but
Mr
Pancks
had
now
so
far
impressed
his
audience
,
that
the
Patriarch
had
to
turn
and
stoop
for
it
himself
.
   
<EOS>
Quick
as
lightning
,
Mr
Pancks
,
who
,
for
some
moments
,
had
had
his
right
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
,
whipped
out
a
pair
of
shears
,
swooped
upon
the
Patriarch
behind
,
and
snipped
off
short
the
sacred
locks
that
flowed
upon
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
paroxysm
of
animosity
and
rapidity
,
Mr
Pancks
then
caught
the
broad
-
brimmed
hat
out
of
the
astounded
Patriarch
's
hand
,
cut
it
down
into
a
mere
stewpan
,
and
fixed
it
on
the
Patriarch
's
head
.
   
<EOS>
Before
the
frightful
results
of
this
desperate
action
,
Mr
Pancks
himself
recoiled
in
consternation
.
 
<EOS>
A
bare
-
polled
,
goggle
-
eyed
,
big
-
headed
lumbering
personage
stood
staring
at
him
,
not
in
the
least
impressive
,
not
in
the
least
venerable
,
who
seemed
to
have
started
out
of
the
earth
to
ask
what
was
become
of
Casby
.
 
<EOS>
After
staring
at
this
phantom
in
return
,
in
silent
awe
,
Mr
Pancks
threw
down
his
shears
,
and
fled
for
a
place
of
hiding
,
where
he
might
lie
sheltered
from
the
consequences
of
his
crime
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
deemed
it
prudent
to
use
all
possible
despatch
in
making
off
,
though
he
was
pursued
by
nothing
but
the
sound
of
laughter
in
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
rippling
through
the
air
and
making
it
ring
again
.

Going
!
 
<EOS>
The
changes
of
a
fevered
room
are
slow
and
fluctuating
;
but
the
changes
of
the
fevered
world
are
rapid
and
irrevocable
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
Little
Dorrit
's
lot
to
wait
upon
both
kinds
of
change
.
 
<EOS>
The
Marshalsea
walls
,
during
a
portion
of
every
day
,
again
embraced
her
in
their
shadows
as
their
child
,
while
she
thought
for
Clennam
,
worked
for
him
,
watched
him
,
and
only
left
him
,
still
to
devote
her
utmost
love
and
care
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Her
part
in
the
life
outside
the
gate
urged
its
pressing
claims
upon
her
too
,
and
her
patience
untiringly
responded
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
Fanny
,
proud
,
fitful
,
whimsical
,
further
advanced
in
that
disqualified
state
for
going
into
society
which
had
so
much
fretted
her
on
the
evening
of
the
tortoise
-
shell
knife
,
resolved
always
to
want
comfort
,
resolved
not
to
be
comforted
,
resolved
to
be
deeply
wronged
,
and
resolved
that
nobody
should
have
the
audacity
to
think
her
so
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
her
brother
,
a
weak
,
proud
,
tipsy
,
young
old
man
,
shaking
from
head
to
foot
,
talking
as
indistinctly
as
if
some
of
the
money
he
plumed
himself
upon
had
got
into
his
mouth
and
could
n't
be
got
out
,
unable
to
walk
alone
in
any
act
of
his
life
,
and
patronising
the
sister
whom
he
selfishly
loved
<EOS>
(
he
always
had
that
negative
merit
,
ill
-
starred
and
ill
-
launched
Tip
!
)
<EOS>
because
he
suffered
her
to
lead
him
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
Mrs
Merdle
in
gauzy
mourning
---
<EOS>
the
original
cap
whereof
had
possibly
been
rent
to
pieces
in
a
fit
of
grief
,
but
had
certainly
yielded
to
a
highly
becoming
article
from
the
Parisian
market
---
warring
with
Fanny
foot
to
foot
,
and
breasting
her
with
her
desolate
bosom
every
hour
in
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
poor
Mr
Sparkler
,
not
knowing
how
to
keep
the
peace
between
them
,
but
humbly
inclining
to
the
opinion
that
they
could
do
no
better
than
agree
that
they
were
both
remarkably
fine
women
,
and
that
there
was
no
nonsense
about
either
of
them
---
for
which
gentle
recommendation
they
united
in
falling
upon
him
frightfully
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
too
,
here
was
Mrs
General
,
got
home
from
foreign
parts
,
sending
a
Prune
and
a
Prism
by
post
every
other
day
,
demanding
a
new
Testimonial
by
way
of
recommendation
to
some
vacant
appointment
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
Of
which
remarkable
gentlewoman
it
may
be
finally
observed
,
that
there
surely
never
was
a
gentlewoman
of
whose
transcendent
fitness
for
any
vacant
appointment
on
the
face
of
this
earth
,
so
many
people
were
(
as
the
warmth
of
her
Testimonials
evinced
)
so
perfectly
satisfied
---
or
who
was
so
very
unfortunate
in
having
a
large
circle
of
ardent
and
distinguished
admirers
,
who
never
themselves
happened
to
want
her
in
any
capacity
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
first
crash
of
the
eminent
Mr
Merdle
's
decease
,
many
important
persons
had
been
unable
to
determine
whether
they
should
cut
Mrs
Merdle
,
or
comfort
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
seemed
,
however
,
essential
to
the
strength
of
their
own
case
that
they
should
admit
her
to
have
been
cruelly
deceived
,
they
graciously
made
the
admission
,
and
continued
to
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
followed
that
Mrs
Merdle
,
as
a
woman
of
fashion
and
good
breeding
who
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
wiles
of
a
vulgar
barbarian
(
for
Mr
Merdle
was
found
out
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
the
moment
he
was
found
out
in
his
pocket
)
,
must
be
actively
championed
by
her
order
for
her
order
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
She
returned
this
fealty
by
causing
it
to
be
understood
that
she
was
even
more
incensed
against
the
felonious
shade
of
the
deceased
than
anybody
else
was
;
thus
,
on
the
whole
,
she
came
out
of
her
furnace
like
a
wise
woman
,
and
did
exceedingly
well
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
's
lordship
was
fortunately
one
of
those
shelves
on
which
a
gentleman
is
considered
to
be
put
away
for
life
,
unless
there
should
be
reasons
for
hoisting
him
up
with
the
Barnacle
crane
to
a
more
lucrative
height
.
 
<EOS>
That
patriotic
servant
accordingly
stuck
to
his
colours
(
the
Standard
of
four
Quarterings
)
,
and
was
a
perfect
Nelson
in
respect
of
nailing
them
to
the
mast
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
profits
of
his
intrepidity
,
Mrs
Sparkler
and
Mrs
Merdle
,
inhabiting
different
floors
of
the
genteel
little
temple
of
inconvenience
to
which
the
smell
of
the
day
before
yesterday
's
soup
and
coach
-
horses
was
as
constant
as
Death
to
man
,
arrayed
themselves
to
fight
it
out
in
the
lists
of
Society
,
sworn
rivals
.
 
<EOS>
And
Little
Dorrit
,
seeing
all
these
things
as
they
developed
themselves
,
could
not
but
wonder
,
anxiously
,
into
what
back
corner
of
the
genteel
establishment
Fanny
's
children
would
be
poked
by
-
and
-
by
,
and
who
would
take
care
of
those
unborn
little
victims
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
being
far
too
ill
to
be
spoken
with
on
subjects
of
emotion
or
anxiety
,
and
his
recovery
greatly
depending
on
the
repose
into
which
his
weakness
could
be
hushed
,
Little
Dorrit
's
sole
reliance
during
this
heavy
period
was
on
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
still
abroad
;
but
she
had
written
to
him
through
his
daughter
,
immediately
after
first
seeing
Arthur
in
the
Marshalsea
and
since
,
confiding
her
uneasiness
to
him
on
the
points
on
which
she
was
most
anxious
,
but
especially
on
one
.
 
<EOS>
To
that
one
,
the
continued
absence
of
Mr
Meagles
abroad
,
instead
of
his
comforting
presence
in
the
Marshalsea
,
was
referable
.
   
<EOS>
Without
disclosing
the
precise
nature
of
the
documents
that
had
fallen
into
Rigaud
's
hands
,
Little
Dorrit
had
confided
the
general
outline
of
that
story
to
Mr
Meagles
,
to
whom
she
had
also
recounted
his
fate
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
cautious
habits
of
the
scales
and
scoop
at
once
showed
Mr
Meagles
the
importance
of
recovering
the
original
papers
;
wherefore
he
wrote
back
to
Little
Dorrit
,
strongly
confirming
her
in
the
solicitude
she
expressed
on
that
head
,
and
adding
that
he
would
not
come
over
to
England
"
without
making
some
attempt
to
trace
them
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
Mr
Henry
Gowan
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
agreeable
to
him
not
to
know
the
Meagleses
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
considerate
as
to
lay
no
injunctions
on
his
wife
in
that
particular
;
but
he
mentioned
to
Mr
Meagles
that
personally
they
did
not
appear
to
him
to
get
on
together
,
and
that
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
---
politely
,
and
without
any
scene
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
---
they
agreed
that
they
were
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
,
but
were
best
apart
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Meagles
,
who
was
already
sensible
that
he
did
not
advance
his
daughter
's
happiness
by
being
constantly
slighted
in
her
presence
,
said
"
Good
,
Henry
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
my
Pet
's
husband
;
you
have
displaced
me
,
in
the
course
of
nature
;
if
you
wish
it
,
good
!
"
<EOS>
This
arrangement
involved
the
contingent
advantage
,
which
perhaps
Henry
Gowan
had
not
foreseen
,
that
both
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
were
more
liberal
than
before
to
their
daughter
,
when
their
communication
was
only
with
her
and
her
young
child
:
and
that
his
high
spirit
found
itself
better
provided
with
money
,
without
being
under
the
degrading
necessity
of
knowing
whence
it
came
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
at
such
a
period
,
naturally
seized
an
occupation
with
great
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
from
his
daughter
the
various
towns
which
Rigaud
had
been
haunting
,
and
the
various
hotels
at
which
he
had
been
living
for
some
time
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
occupation
he
set
himself
was
to
visit
these
with
all
discretion
and
speed
,
and
,
in
the
event
of
finding
anywhere
that
he
had
left
a
bill
unpaid
,
and
a
box
or
parcel
behind
,
to
pay
such
bill
,
and
bring
away
such
box
or
parcel
.
   
<EOS>
With
no
other
attendant
than
Mother
,
Mr
Meagles
went
upon
his
pilgrimage
,
and
encountered
a
number
of
adventures
.
 
<EOS>
Not
the
least
of
his
difficulties
was
,
that
he
never
knew
what
was
said
to
him
,
and
that
he
pursued
his
inquiries
among
people
who
never
knew
what
he
said
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
with
an
unshaken
confidence
that
the
English
tongue
was
somehow
the
mother
tongue
of
the
whole
world
,
only
the
people
were
too
stupid
to
know
it
,
Mr
Meagles
harangued
innkeepers
in
the
most
voluble
manner
,
entered
into
loud
explanations
of
the
most
complicated
sort
,
and
utterly
renounced
replies
in
the
native
language
of
the
respondents
,
on
the
ground
that
they
were
"
all
bosh
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
interpreters
were
called
in
;
whom
Mr
Meagles
addressed
in
such
idiomatic
terms
of
speech
,
as
instantly
to
extinguish
and
shut
up
---
which
made
the
matter
worse
.
<EOS>
On
a
balance
of
the
account
,
however
,
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
lost
much
;
for
,
although
he
found
no
property
,
he
found
so
many
debts
and
various
associations
of
discredit
with
the
proper
name
,
which
was
the
only
word
he
made
intelligible
,
that
he
was
almost
everywhere
overwhelmed
with
injurious
accusations
.
 
<EOS>
On
no
fewer
than
four
occasions
the
police
were
called
in
to
receive
denunciations
of
Mr
Meagles
as
a
Knight
of
Industry
,
a
good
-
for
-
nothing
,
and
a
thief
,
all
of
which
opprobrious
language
he
bore
with
the
best
temper
(
having
no
idea
what
it
meant
)
,
and
was
in
the
most
ignominious
manner
escorted
to
steam
-
boats
and
public
carriages
,
to
be
got
rid
of
,
talking
all
the
while
,
like
a
cheerful
and
fluent
Briton
as
he
was
,
with
Mother
under
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
in
his
own
tongue
,
and
in
his
own
head
,
Mr
Meagles
was
a
clear
,
shrewd
,
persevering
man
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
"
worked
round
,
"
as
he
called
it
,
to
Paris
in
his
pilgrimage
,
and
had
wholly
failed
in
it
so
far
,
he
was
not
disheartened
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
nearer
to
England
<EOS>
I
follow
him
,
you
see
,
Mother
,
"
argued
Mr
Meagles
,
"
the
nearer
I
am
likely
to
come
to
the
papers
,
whether
they
turn
up
<EOS>
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
Because
it
is
only
reasonable
to
conclude
that
he
would
deposit
them
somewhere
where
they
would
be
safe
from
people
over
in
England
,
and
where
they
would
yet
be
accessible
to
himself
,
do
n't
you
see
?
"
   
<EOS>
At
Paris
Mr
Meagles
found
a
letter
from
Little
Dorrit
,
lying
waiting
for
him
;
in
which
she
mentioned
that
she
had
been
able
to
talk
for
a
minute
or
two
with
Mr
Clennam
about
this
man
who
was
no
more
;
and
that
when
she
told
Mr
Clennam
that
his
friend
Mr
Meagles
,
who
was
on
his
way
to
see
him
,
had
an
interest
in
ascertaining
something
about
the
man
if
he
could
,
he
had
asked
her
to
tell
Mr
Meagles
that
he
had
been
known
to
Miss
Wade
,
then
living
in
such
a
street
at
Calais
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
As
soon
afterwards
as
might
be
in
those
Diligence
days
,
Mr
Meagles
rang
the
cracked
bell
at
the
cracked
gate
,
and
it
jarred
open
,
and
the
peasant
-
woman
stood
in
the
dark
doorway
,
saying
,
"
Ice
-
say
!
<EOS>
Seer
!
 
<EOS>
Who
?
"
 
<EOS>
In
acknowledgment
of
whose
address
,
Mr
Meagles
murmured
to
himself
that
there
was
some
sense
about
these
Calais
people
,
who
really
did
know
something
of
what
you
and
themselves
were
up
to
;
and
returned
,
"
Miss
Wade
,
my
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
then
shown
into
the
presence
of
Miss
Wade
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
some
time
since
we
met
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
clearing
his
throat
;
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
been
pretty
well
,
Miss
Wade
?
"
   
<EOS>
Without
hoping
that
he
or
anybody
else
had
been
pretty
well
,
Miss
Wade
asked
him
to
what
she
was
indebted
for
the
honour
of
seeing
him
again
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
glanced
all
round
the
room
without
observing
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
box
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
truth
is
,
Miss
Wade
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
in
a
comfortable
,
managing
,
not
to
say
coaxing
voice
,
"
it
is
possible
that
you
may
be
able
to
throw
a
light
upon
a
little
something
that
is
at
present
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Any
unpleasant
bygones
between
us
are
bygones
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
be
helped
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
recollect
my
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
Time
changes
so
!
<EOS>
A
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
his
innocence
,
Mr
Meagles
could
not
have
struck
a
worse
keynote
.
<EOS>
He
paused
for
any
expression
of
interest
,
but
paused
in
vain
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
the
subject
you
wished
to
enter
on
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
after
a
cold
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
returned
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
your
good
nature
might
---
"
   
"
I
thought
you
knew
,
"
she
interrupted
,
with
a
smile
,
"
that
my
good
nature
is
not
to
be
calculated
upon
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
so
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
;
"
you
do
yourself
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
However
,
to
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
For
he
was
sensible
of
having
gained
nothing
by
approaching
it
in
a
roundabout
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
from
my
friend
Clennam
,
who
,
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear
,
has
been
and
still
is
very
ill
---
"
   
<EOS>
He
paused
again
,
and
again
she
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
that
you
had
some
knowledge
of
one
Blandois
,
lately
killed
in
London
by
a
violent
accident
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
do
n't
mistake
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
was
a
slight
knowledge
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
dexterously
forestalling
an
angry
interruption
which
he
saw
about
to
break
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
fully
aware
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
slight
knowledge
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
question
is
,
"
Mr
Meagles
's
voice
here
became
comfortable
again
,
"
did
he
,
on
his
way
to
England
last
time
,
leave
a
box
of
papers
,
or
a
bundle
of
papers
,
or
some
papers
or
other
in
some
receptacle
or
other
---
any
papers
---
with
you
:
begging
you
to
allow
him
to
leave
them
here
for
a
short
time
,
until
he
wanted
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
question
is
?
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whose
question
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mine
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
not
only
mine
but
Clennam
's
question
,
and
other
people
's
question
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
sure
,
"
continued
Mr
Meagles
,
whose
heart
was
overflowing
with
Pet
,
"
that
you
ca
n't
have
any
unkind
feeling
towards
my
daughter
;
it
's
impossible
.
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
her
question
,
too
;
being
one
in
which
a
particular
friend
of
hers
is
nearly
interested
.
 
<EOS>
So
here
I
am
,
frankly
to
say
that
is
the
question
,
and
to
ask
,
Now
,
did
he
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
she
returned
,
"
I
seem
to
be
a
mark
for
everybody
who
knew
anything
of
a
man
<EOS>
I
once
in
my
life
hired
,
and
paid
,
and
dismissed
,
to
aim
their
questions
at
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Meagles
,
"
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
take
offence
,
because
it
's
the
plainest
question
in
the
world
,
and
might
be
asked
of
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
documents
I
refer
to
were
not
his
own
,
were
wrongfully
obtained
,
might
at
some
time
or
other
be
troublesome
to
an
innocent
person
to
have
in
keeping
,
and
are
sought
by
the
people
to
whom
they
really
belong
.
 
<EOS>
He
passed
through
Calais
going
to
London
,
and
there
were
reasons
why
he
should
not
take
them
with
him
then
,
why
he
should
wish
to
be
able
to
put
his
hand
upon
them
readily
,
and
why
he
should
distrust
leaving
them
with
people
of
his
own
sort
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
leave
them
here
?
 
<EOS>
I
declare
if
I
knew
how
to
avoid
giving
you
offence
,
I
would
take
any
pains
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
the
question
personally
,
but
there
's
nothing
personal
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
put
it
to
any
one
;
I
have
put
it
already
to
many
people
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
leave
them
here
?
 
<EOS>
Did
he
leave
anything
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
unfortunately
,
Miss
Wade
,
you
know
nothing
about
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
answered
your
unaccountable
question
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
leave
them
here
,
and
I
know
nothing
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
;
that
's
over
;
and
I
hope
there
is
not
much
harm
done
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Tattycoram
<EOS>
well
,
Miss
Wade
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Harriet
well
?
 
<EOS>
O
yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
put
my
foot
in
it
again
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
thus
corrected
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
keep
my
foot
out
of
it
here
,
it
seems
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
if
I
had
thought
twice
about
it
,
I
might
never
have
given
her
the
jingling
name
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
one
means
to
be
good
-
natured
and
sportive
with
young
people
,
one
does
n't
think
twice
.
 
<EOS>
Her
old
friend
leaves
a
kind
word
for
her
,
Miss
Wade
,
if
you
should
think
proper
to
deliver
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
as
to
that
;
and
Mr
Meagles
,
taking
his
honest
face
out
of
the
dull
room
,
where
it
shone
like
a
sun
,
took
it
to
the
Hotel
where
he
had
left
Mrs
Meagles
,
and
where
he
made
the
Report
:
"
Beaten
,
Mother
;
no
effects
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
next
to
the
London
Steam
Packet
,
which
sailed
in
the
night
;
and
next
to
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
The
faithful
John
was
on
duty
when
Father
and
Mother
Meagles
presented
themselves
at
the
wicket
towards
nightfall
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dorrit
was
not
there
then
,
he
said
;
but
she
had
been
there
in
the
morning
,
and
invariably
came
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
was
slowly
mending
;
and
Maggy
and
Mrs
Plornish
and
Mr
Baptist
took
care
of
him
by
turns
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dorrit
was
sure
to
come
back
that
evening
before
the
bell
rang
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
room
the
Marshal
had
lent
her
,
up
-
stairs
,
in
which
they
could
wait
for
her
,
if
they
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
Mistrustful
that
it
might
be
hazardous
to
Arthur
to
see
him
without
preparation
<EOS>
,
Mr
Meagles
accepted
the
offer
;
and
they
were
left
shut
up
in
the
room
,
looking
down
through
its
barred
window
into
the
jail
.
   
<EOS>
The
cramped
area
of
the
prison
had
such
an
effect
on
Mrs
Meagles
that
she
began
to
weep
,
and
such
an
effect
on
Mr
Meagles
that
he
began
to
gasp
for
air
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
,
panting
,
and
making
himself
worse
by
laboriously
fanning
himself
with
her

,
when
he
turned
towards
the
opening
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
Good
gracious
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
this
is
not
Miss
Dorrit
!
<EOS>
Why
,
Mother
,
look
!
 
<EOS>
Tattycoram
!
"
   
<EOS>
No
other
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
Tattycoram
's
arms
was
an
iron
box
some
two
feet
square
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
box
had
Affery
Flintwinch
seen
,
in
the
first
of
her
dreams
,
going
out
of
the
old
house
in
the
dead
of
the
night
under
Double
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
Tattycoram
put
on
the
ground
at
her
old
master
's
feet
:
<EOS>
this
,
Tattycoram
fell
on
her
knees
by
,
and
beat
her
hands
upon
,
crying
half
in
exultation
and
half
in
despair
,
half
in
laughter
and
half
in
tears
,
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
dear
Master
;
take
me
back
,
dear
Mistress
;
here
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tatty
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
you
wanted
!
"
said
Tattycoram
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
put
in
the
next
room
not
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
you
ask
her
about
it
<EOS>
,
I
heard
her
say
she
had
n't
got
it
,
I
was
there
when
he
left
it
,
and
I
took
it
at
bedtime
and
brought
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
Here
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
girl
,
"
cried
Mr
Meagles
,
more
breathless
than
before
,
"
how
did
you
come
over
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
in
the
boat
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sitting
wrapped
up
at
the
other
end
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
took
a
coach
at
the
wharf
,
I
took
another
coach
and
followed
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
would
have
given
it
up
after
what
you
had
said
to
her
about
its
being
wanted
;
she
would
sooner
have
sunk
it
in
the
sea
,
or
burnt
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
here
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
glow
and
rapture
that
the
girl
was
in
,
with
her
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
never
wanted
it
to
be
left
,
I
must
say
that
for
her
;
but
he
left
it
,
and
I
knew
well
that
after
what
you
said
,
and
after
her
denying
it
,
she
never
would
have
given
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
it
is
!
<EOS>
Dear
Master
,
dear
Mistress
,
take
me
back
again
,
and
give
me
back
the
dear
old
name
!
 
<EOS>
Let
this
intercede
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Here
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
Father
and
Mother
Meagles
never
deserved
their
names
better
than
when
they
took
the
headstrong
foundling
-
girl
into
their
protection
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
wretched
,
"
cried
Tattycoram
,
weeping
much
more
,
"
always
so
unhappy
,
and
so
repentant
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
of
her
from
the
first
time
I
saw
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
she
had
got
a
power
over
me
through
understanding
what
was
bad
in
me
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
madness
in
me
,
and
she
could
raise
it
whenever
she
liked
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
,
<EOS>
when
I
got
into
that
state
,
that
people
were
all
against
me
because
of
my
first
beginning
;
and
the
kinder
they
were
to
me
,
the
worse
fault
I
found
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
it
out
that
they
triumphed
above
me
,
and
that
they
wanted
to
make
me
envy
them
,
when
I
know
---
when
I
even
knew
then
---
that
they
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
beautiful
young
mistress
not
so
happy
as
she
ought
to
have
been
,
and
I
gone
away
from
her
!
 
<EOS>
Such
a
brute
and
a
wretch
as
she
must
think
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
say
a
word
to
her
for
me
,
and
ask
her
to
be
as
forgiving
as
you
two
are
?
 
<EOS>
For
I
am
not
so
bad
as
I
was
,
"
pleaded
Tattycoram
;
"
I
am
bad
enough
,
but
not
so
bad
as
I
was
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
Miss
Wade
before
me
all
this
time
,
as
if
it
was
my
own
self
grown
ripe
---
turning
everything
the
wrong
way
,
and
twisting
all
good
into
evil
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
her
before
me
all
this
time
,
finding
no
pleasure
in
anything
but
keeping
me
as
miserable
,
suspicious
,
and
tormenting
as
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
she
had
much
to
do
,
to
do
that
,
"
cried
Tattycoram
,
in
a
closing
great
burst
of
distress
,
"
for
I
was
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
mean
to
say
,
that
,
after
what
I
have
gone
through
,
I
hope
I
shall
never
be
quite
so
bad
again
,
and
that
I
shall
get
better
by
very
slow
degrees
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
very
hard
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
stop
at
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
sir
,
I
'll
count
five
-
and
-
twenty
hundred
,
five
-
and
-
twenty
thousand
!
"
   
<EOS>
Another
opening
of
the
door
,
and
Tattycoram
subsided
,
and
Little
Dorrit
came
in
,
and
Mr
Meagles
with
pride
and
joy
produced
the
box
,
and
her
gentle
face
was
lighted
up
with
grateful
happiness
and
joy
.
   
<EOS>
The
secret
was
safe
now
!
 
<EOS>
She
could
keep
her
own
part
of
it
from
him
;
he
should
never
know
of
her
loss
;
in
time
to
come
he
should
know
all
that
was
of
import
to
himself
;
but
he
should
never
know
what
concerned
her
only
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
all
passed
,
all
forgiven
,
all
forgotten
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
Miss
Dorrit
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
;
"
I
am
a
man
of
business
---
or
at
least
was
---
<EOS>
and
I
am
going
to
take
my
measures
promptly
,
in
that
character
.
 
<EOS>
Had
I
better
see
Arthur
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
his
room
and
ascertain
how
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
think
it
will
be
better
not
to
see
him
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
of
your
opinion
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
and
therefore
I
have
not
been
any
nearer
to
him
than
this
dismal
room
.
<EOS>
Then
I
shall
probably
not
see
him
for
some
little
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
explain
what
I
mean
when
you
come
back
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
left
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
looking
through
the
bars
of
the
window
,
saw
her
pass
out
of
the
Lodge
below
him
into
the
prison
-
yard
.
<EOS>
He
said
gently
,
"
Tattycoram
,
come
to
me
a
moment
,
my
good
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
that
young
lady
who
was
here
just
now
---
that
little
,
quiet
,
fragile
figure
passing
along
there
,
Tatty
?
 
<EOS>
Look
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
stand
out
of
the
way
to
let
her
go
by
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
---
see
the
poor
,
shabby
fellows
---
pull
off
their
hats
to
her
quite
politely
,
and
now
she
glides
in
at
that
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
See
her
,
Tattycoram
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
tell
,
Tatty
,
that
she
was
once
regularly
called
the
child
of
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
born
here
,
and
lived
here
many
years
.
   
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
breathe
here
.
 
<EOS>
A
doleful
place
to
be
born
and
bred
in
,
Tattycoram
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
indeed
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
she
had
constantly
thought
of
herself
,
and
settled
with
herself
that
everybody
visited
this
place
upon
her
,
turned
it
against
her
,
and
cast
it
at
her
,
she
would
have
led
an
irritable
and
probably
an
useless
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
have
heard
tell
,
Tattycoram
,
that
her
young
life
has
been
one
of
active
resignation
,
goodness
,
and
noble
service
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
consider
those
eyes
of
hers
,
that
were
here
just
now
,
to
have
always
looked
at
,
to
get
that
expression
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
"
   
"
Duty
,
Tattycoram
.
 
<EOS>
Begin
it
early
,
and
do
it
well
;
and
there
is
no
antecedent
to
it
,
in
any
origin
or
station
,
that
will
tell
against
us
with
the
Almighty
,
or
with
ourselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
remained
at
the
window
,
Mother
joining
them
and
pitying
the
prisoners
,
until
she
was
seen
coming
back
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
soon
in
the
room
,
and
recommended
that
Arthur
,
whom
she
had
left
calm
and
composed
,
should
not
be
visited
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
cheerily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
a
doubt
that
's
best
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
trust
my
remembrances
then
,
my
sweet
nurse
,
in
your
hands
,
and
<EOS>
I
well
know
they
could
n't
be
in
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
off
again
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
,
surprised
,
asked
him
where
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
"
I
ca
n't
live
without
breathing
.
 
<EOS>
This
place
has
taken
my
breath
away
,
and
I
shall
never
get
it
back
again
until
Arthur
is
out
of
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
that
a
reason
for
going
off
again
to
-
morrow
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
understand
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
we
three
will
put
up
at
a
City
Hotel
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
morning
,
Mother
and
Tattycoram
will
go
down
to
Twickenham
,
where
Mrs
Tickit
,
sitting
attended
by
Dr
Buchan
in
the
parlour
-
window
,
will
think
them
a
couple
of
ghosts
;
and
I
shall
go
abroad
again
for
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
Dan
here
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
tell
you
,
my
love
,
it
's
of
no
use
writing
and
planning
and
conditionally
speculating
upon
this
and
that
and
the
other
,
at
uncertain
intervals
and
distances
;
we
must
have
Doyce
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
devote
myself
at
daybreak
to
-
morrow
morning
,
to
bringing
Doyce
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
nothing
to
me
to
go
and
find
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
an
old
traveller
,
and
all
foreign
languages
and
customs
are
alike
to
me
<EOS>
---
I
never
understand
anything
about
any
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
ca
n't
be
put
to
any
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
Go
at
once
I
must
,
it
stands
to
reason
;
because
I
ca
n't
live
without
breathing
freely
;
and
I
ca
n't
breathe
freely
until
Arthur
is
out
of
this
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
stifled
at
the
present
moment
,
and
have
scarcely
breath
enough
to
say
this
much
,
and
to
carry
this
precious
box
down
-
stairs
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
got
into
the
street
as
the
bell
began
to
ring
,
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
carrying
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
had
no
conveyance
there
:
which
rather
surprised
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
called
a
coach
for
her
<EOS>
and
she
got
into
it
,
and
he
placed
the
box
beside
her
when
she
was
seated
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
joy
and
gratitude
she
kissed
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
that
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
goes
against
my
feeling
of
what
's
right
,
that
YOU
should
do
homage
to
ME
---
at
the
Marshalsea
Gate
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
bent
forward
,
and
kissed
his
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
remind
me
of
the
days
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
suddenly
drooping
---
"
<EOS>
but
she
's
very
fond
of
him
,
and
hides
his
faults
,
and
thinks
that
no
one
sees
them
---
and
he
certainly
is
well
connected
and
of
a
very
good
family
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
comfort
he
had
in
the
loss
of
his
daughter
,
and
if
he
made
the
most
of
it
,
who
could
blame
him
?

Chapter
34
.
<EOS>
Gone
 
On
a
healthy
autumn
day
,
the
Marshalsea
prisoner
,
weak
but
otherwise
restored
,
sat
listening
to
a
voice
that
read
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
healthy
autumn
day
;
when
the
golden
fields
had
been
reaped
and
ploughed
again
,
when
the
summer
fruits
had
ripened
and
waned
,
when
the
green
perspectives
of
hops
had
been
laid
low
by
the
busy
pickers
,
when
the
apples
clustering
in
the
orchards
were
russet
,
and
the
berries
of
the
mountain
ash
were
crimson
among
the
yellowing
foliage
.
 
<EOS>
Already
in
the
woods
,
glimpses
of
the
hardy
winter
that
was
coming
were
to
be
caught
through
unaccustomed
openings
among
the
boughs
where
the
prospect
shone
defined
and
clear
,
free
from
the
bloom
of
the
drowsy
summer
weather
,
which
had
rested
on
it
as
the
bloom
lies
on
the
plum
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
from
the
seashore
the
ocean
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
lying
asleep
in
the
heat
,
but
its
thousand
sparkling
eyes
were
open
,
and
its
whole
breadth
was
in
joyful
animation
,
from
the
cool
sand
on
the
beach
to
the
little
sails
on
the
horizon
,
drifting
away
like
autumn
-
tinted
leaves
that
had
drifted
from
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Changeless
and
barren
,
looking
ignorantly
at
all
the
seasons
with
its
fixed
,
pinched
face
of
poverty
and
care
<EOS>
,
the
prison
had
not
a
touch
of
any
of
these
beauties
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
Blossom
<EOS>
what
would
,
its
bricks
and
bars
bore
uniformly
the
same
dead
crop
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
Clennam
,
listening
to
the
voice
as
it
read
to
him
,
heard
in
it
all
that
great
Nature
was
doing
,
heard
in
it
all
the
soothing
songs
she
sings
to
man
.
 
<EOS>
At
no
Mother
's
knee
but
hers
<EOS>
had
he
ever
dwelt
in
his
youth
on
hopeful
promises
,
on
playful
fancies
,
on
the
harvests
of
tenderness
and
humility
that
lie
hidden
in
the
early
-
fostered
seeds
of
the
imagination
;
on
the
oaks
of
retreat
from
blighting
winds
,
that
have
the
germs
of
their
strong
roots
in
nursery
acorns
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
tones
of
the
voice
that
read
to
him
,
there
were
memories
of
an
old
feeling
of
such
things
,
and
echoes
of
every
merciful
and
loving
whisper
that
had
ever
stolen
to
him
in
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
voice
stopped
,
he
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
,
murmuring
that
the
light
was
strong
upon
them
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
put
the
book
by
,
and
presently
arose
quietly
to
shade
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
sat
at
her
needlework
in
her
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
softened
,
Little
Dorrit
brought
her
chair
closer
to
his
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
will
soon
be
over
now
,
dear
Mr
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
Not
only
are
Mr
Doyce
's
letters
to
you
so
full
of
friendship
and
encouragement
,
but
Mr
Rugg
says
his
letters
to
him
are
so
full
of
help
,
and
that
everybody
(
now
a
little
anger
is
past
)
is
so
considerate
,
and
speaks
so
well
of
you
,
that
it
will
soon
be
over
now

Dear

Good
angel

<EOS>

You
praise
me
far
too
much

<EOS>
And
yet
it
is
such
an
exquisite
pleasure
to
me
to
hear
you
speak
so
feelingly
,
and
to
---
and
to
see
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
raising
her
eyes
to
his
,
"
<EOS>
how
deeply
you
mean
it
,
that
I
can
not
say
Do
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
lifted
her
hand
to
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
here
<EOS>
many
,
many
times
,
when
I
have
not
seen
you
,
Little
Dorrit
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
been
here
sometimes
when
I
have
not
come
into
the
room
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
often
?
"
   
"
Rather
often
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
timidly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Every
day
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
,
after
hesitating
,
"
that
I
have
been
here
at
least
twice
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
He
might
have
released
the
little
light
hand
after
fervently
kissing
it
again
;
but
that
,
with
a
very
gentle
lingering
where
it
was
,
it
seemed
to
court
being
retained
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
in
both
of
his
,
and
it
lay
softly
on
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Little
Dorrit
,
it
is
not
my
imprisonment
only
that
will
soon
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
This
sacrifice
of
you
must
be
ended
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
learn
to
part
again
,
and
to
take
our
different
ways
so
wide
asunder
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
forgotten
what
we
said
together
,
when
you
came
back
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
no
,
I
have
not
forgotten
it

<EOS>
But
something
has
been
<EOS>
---
You
feel
quite
strong
to
-
day
,
do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
strong
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
hand
he
held
crept
up
a
little
nearer
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
quite
strong
enough
to
know
what
a
great
fortune
I
have
got
?

<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
be
told

<EOS>
No
fortune
can
be
too
great
or
good
for
Little
Dorrit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
anxiously
waiting
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
longing
and
longing
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
sure
you
will
not
take
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
sure
you
will
not
take
half
of
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
dear
Little
Dorrit
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
looked
at
him
silently
,
there
was
something
in
her
affectionate
face
that
he
did
not
quite
comprehend
:
something
that
could
have
broken
into
tears
in
a
moment
,
and
yet
that
was
happy
and
proud
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
sorry
to
hear
what
I
have
to
tell
you
about
Fanny
.
<EOS>
Poor
Fanny
has
lost
everything
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
nothing
left
but
her
husband
's
income
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
papa
gave
her
when
she
married
was
lost
as
your
money
was
lost
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
same
hands
,
and
it
is
all
gone
.
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
was
more
shocked
than
surprised
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
it
might
not
be
so
bad
,
"
he
said
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
had
feared
a
heavy
loss
there
,
knowing
the
connection
between
her
husband
and
the
defaulter

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
It
is
all
gone

<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
for
Fanny

very
,
very
,
very
sorry
for
poor
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
brother
too
!

<EOS>
"
Had
he
property
in
the
same
hands
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
And
it
's
all
gone

<EOS>
---
How
much
do
you
think
my
own
great
fortune
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
Arthur
looked
at
her
inquiringly
,
with
a
new
apprehension
on
him
,
she
withdrew
her
hand
,
and
laid
her
face
down
on
the
spot
where
it
had
rested
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
in
the
world

<EOS>
I
am
as
poor
as
when
I
lived
here
.
<EOS>
When
papa
came
over
to
England
,
he
confided
everything
he
had
to
the
same
hands
,
and
it
is
all
swept
away
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
dearest
and
best
<EOS>
,
are
you
quite
sure
you
will
not
share
my
fortune
with
me
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
Locked
in
his
arms
,
held
to
his
heart
,
with
his
manly
tears
upon
her
own
cheek
<EOS>
,
she
drew
the
slight
hand
round
his
neck
,
and
clasped
it
in
its
fellow
-
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
to
part
,
my
dearest
Arthur
;
never
any
more
,
until
the
last
!
   
<EOS>
I
never
was
rich
before
,
I
never
was
proud
before

I
never
was
happy
before

I
am
rich
in
being
taken
by
you
,
I
am
proud
in
having
been
resigned
by
you
,
I
am
happy
in
being
with
you
in
this
prison
,
as
I
should
be
happy
in
coming
back
to
it
with
you

if
it
should
be
the
will

GOD

comforting

I
love
you
dearly

I
would
rather
pass
my
life
here
with
you

go
out
daily

working
for
our
bread

I
would
have
the
greatest
fortune
that
ever
was
told
,
and
be
the
greatest
lady
that
ever
was
honoured
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
if
poor
papa
may
only
know
how
blest
at
last
my
heart
is
,
in
this
room
where
he
suffered
for
so
many
years
!
"
   
<EOS>
Maggy
had
of
course
been
staring
from
the
first
,
and
had
of
course
been
crying
her
eyes
out
long
before
this
.
 
<EOS>
Maggy
was
now
so
overjoyed
that
,
after
hugging
her
little
mother
with
all
her
might
,
she
went
down
-
stairs
like
a
clog
-
hornpipe
to
find
somebody
or
other
to
whom
to
impart
her
gladness
.
 
<EOS>
Whom
should
Maggy
meet
but
<EOS>
Flora
and
Mr
F
's
Aunt
opportunely
coming
in
?
 
<EOS>
And
whom
else
,
as
a
consequence
of
that
meeting
,
should
Little
Dorrit
find
waiting
for
herself
,
when
,
a
good
two
or
three
hours
afterwards
,
she
went
out
?
   
<EOS>
Flora
's
eyes
were
a
little
red
,
and
she
seemed
rather
out
of
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
was
so
stiffened
that
she
had
the
appearance
of
being
past
bending
by
any
means
short
of
powerful
mechanical
pressure
.
 
<EOS>
Her
bonnet
was
cocked
up
behind
in
a
terrific
manner
;
and
her
stony
reticule
was
as
rigid
as
if
it
had
been
petrified
by
the
Gorgon
's
head
,
and
had
got
it
at
that
moment
inside
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
imposing
attributes
,
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
publicly
seated
on
the
steps
of
the
Marshal
's
official
residence
,
had
been
for
the
two
or
three
hours
in
question
a
great
boon
to
the
younger
inhabitants
of
the
Borough
,
whose
sallies
of
humour
she
had
considerably
flushed
herself
by
resenting
at
the
point
of
her
umbrella
,
from
time
to
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Painfully
aware
,
Miss
Dorrit
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
that
to
propose
an
adjournment
to
any
place
to
one
so
far
removed
by
fortune
and
so
courted
and
caressed
by
the
best
society
must
ever
appear
intruding
even
if
not
a
pie
-
shop
far
below
your
present
sphere
and
a
back
-
parlour
though
a
civil
man
<EOS>
but
if
for
the
sake
of
Arthur
---
can
not
overcome
it
more
improper
now
than
ever
late
Doyce
and
Clennam
---
<EOS>
one
last
remark
I
might
wish
to
make
one
last
explanation
I
might
wish
to
offer
perhaps
<EOS>
your
good
nature
might
excuse
under
pretence
of
three
kidney
ones
the
humble
place
of
conversation
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rightly
interpreting
this
rather
obscure
speech
,
Little
Dorrit
returned
that
she
was
quite
at
Flora
's
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
accordingly
led
the
way
across
the
road
to
the
pie
-
shop
in
question
:
Mr
F
's
Aunt
stalking
across
in
the
rear
,
and
putting
herself
in
the
way
of
being
run
over
,
with
a
perseverance
worthy
of
a
better
cause
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
"
three
kidney
ones
,
"
which
were
to
be
a
blind
to
the
conversation
,
were
set
before
them
on
three
little
tin
platters
,
each
kidney
one
ornamented
with
a
hole
at
the
top
,
into
which
the
civil
man
poured
hot
gravy
out
of
a
spouted
can
as
if
he
were
feeding
three
lamps
<EOS>
,
Flora
took
out
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
Fancy
's
fair
dreams
,
"
she
began
,
"
have
ever
pictured
that
when
Arthur
---
can
not
overcome
it
pray
excuse
me
---
was
restored
to
freedom
even
a
pie
as
far
from
flaky
as
the
present
and
so
deficient
in
kidney
as
to
be
in
that
respect
like
a
minced
nutmeg
might
not
prove
unacceptable
if
offered
by
the
hand
of
true
regard
such
visions
have
for
ever
fled
and
all
is
cancelled
but
being
aware
that
tender
relations
are
in
contemplation
beg
to
state
that
I
heartily
wish
well
to
both
and
find
no
fault
with
either
not
the
least
,
it
may
be
withering
to
know
that
ere
the
hand
of
Time
had
made
me
much
less
slim
than
formerly
and
dreadfully
red
on
the
slightest
exertion
particularly
after
eating
<EOS>
I
well
know
when
it
takes
the
form
of
a
rash
,
it
might
have
been
and
was
not
through
the
interruption
of
parents
and
mental
torpor
succeeded
until
the
mysterious
clue
was
held
by
Mr
F
<EOS>
still
I
would
not
be
ungenerous
to
either
<EOS>
and
I
heartily
wish
well
to
both
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
took
her
hand
,
and
thanked
her
for
all
her
old
kindness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Call
it
not
kindness
,
"
returned
Flora
,
giving
her
an
honest
kiss
,
"
for
you
always
were
the
best
and
dearest
little
thing
that
ever
was
if
I
may
take
the
liberty
and
even
in
a
money
point
of
view
<EOS>
a
saving
being
Conscience
itself
though
I
must
add
much
more
agreeable
than
mine
ever
was
to
me
for
though
<EOS>
not
I
hope
more
burdened
than
other
people
's
yet
<EOS>
I
have
always
found
it
far
readier
to
make
one
uncomfortable
than
comfortable
and
evidently
taking
a
greater
pleasure
in
doing
it
<EOS>
but
I
am
wandering
<EOS>
,
one
hope
I
wish
to
express
ere
yet
the
closing
scene
draws
in
and
it
is
that
I
do
trust
for
the
sake
of
old
times
and
old
sincerity
that
Arthur
will
know
that
I
did
n't
desert
him
in
his
misfortunes
but
that
I
came
backwards
and
forwards
constantly
to
ask
if
I
could
do
anything
for
him
and
that
I
sat
in
the
pie
-
shop
where
they
very
civilly
fetched
something
warm
in
a
tumbler
from
the
hotel
and
really
very
nice
hours
after
hours
to
keep
him
company
over
the
way
without
his
knowing
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Flora
really
had
tears
in
her
eyes
now
,
and
they
showed
her
to
great
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Over
and
above
which
,
"
said
Flora
,
"
I
earnestly
beg
you
as
the
dearest
thing
that
ever
was
if
you
'll
still
excuse
the
familiarity
from
one
who
moves
in
very
different
circles
to
let
Arthur
understand
that
I
do
n't
know
after
all
whether
it
was
n't
all
nonsense
between
us
though
pleasant
at
the
time
and
trying
too
and
certainly
Mr
F
did
work
a
change
and
the
spell
being
broken
nothing
could
be
expected
to
take
place
without
weaving
it
afresh
which
various
circumstances
have
combined
to
prevent
of
which
<EOS>
perhaps
not
the
least
powerful
was
that
it
was
not
to
be
,
I
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
if
it
had
been
agreeable
to
Arthur
and
had
brought
itself
about
naturally
in
the
first
instance
I
should
not
have
been
very
glad
being
of
a
lively
disposition
and
moped
at
home
where
papa
undoubtedly
is
the
most
aggravating
of
his
sex
and
not
improved
since
having
been
cut
down
by
the
hand
of
the
Incendiary
into
something
of
which
I
never
saw
the
counterpart
in
all
my
life
but
jealousy
is
not
my
character
nor
ill
-
will
though
many
faults
.
"
   
<EOS>
Without
having
been
able
closely
to
follow
Mrs
Finching
through
this
labyrinth
,
Little
Dorrit
understood
its
purpose
,
and
cordially
accepted
the
trust
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
withered
chaplet
my
dear

said
Flora
,
with
great
enjoyment
,
"
is
then
perished
the
column
is
crumbled

upside
down

I
must
now
retire
into
privacy
and
look
upon
the
ashes
of
departed
joys
no
more
but
taking
a
further
liberty
of
paying
for
the
pastry
which
has
formed
the
humble
pretext
of
our
interview
<EOS>
will
for
ever
say
Adieu
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
who
had
eaten
her
pie
with
great
solemnity
,
and
who
had
been
elaborating
some
grievous
scheme
of
injury
in
her
mind
since
her
first
assumption
of
that
public
position
on
the
Marshal
's
steps
,
took
the
present
opportunity
of
addressing
the
following
Sibyllic
apostrophe
to
the
relict
of
her
late
nephew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bring
him
for'ard
,
and
I
'll
chuck
him
out
o
'
winder
!
"
   
<EOS>
Flora
tried
in
vain
to
soothe
the
excellent
woman
by
explaining
that
they
were
going
home
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
persisted
in
replying
,
"
Bring
him
for'ard
<EOS>
and
I
'll
chuck
him
out
o
'
winder
!
"
<EOS>
Having
reiterated
this
demand
an
immense
number
of
times
,
with
a
sustained
glare
of
defiance
at
Little
Dorrit
,
Mr
F
's
Aunt
folded
her
arms
,
and
sat
down
in
the
corner
of
the
pie
-
shop
parlour
;
steadfastly
refusing
to
budge
until
such
time
as
"
he
"
should
have
been
"
brought
for'ard
,
"
and
the
chucking
portion
of
his
destiny
accomplished
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
condition
of
things
,
Flora
confided
to
Little
Dorrit
that
she
had
not
seen
Mr
F
's
Aunt
so
full
of
life
and
character
for
weeks
;
that
she
would
find
it
necessary
to
remain
there
"
hours
perhaps
,
"
until
the
inexorable
old
lady
could
be
softened
;
and
that
she
could
manage
her
best
alone
.
 
<EOS>
They
parted
,
therefore
,
in
the
friendliest
manner
,
and
with
the
kindest
feeling
on
both
sides
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
holding
out
like
a
grim
fortress
,
and
Flora
becoming
in
need
of
refreshment
,
a
messenger
was
despatched
to
the
hotel
for
the
tumbler
already
glanced
at
,
which
was
afterwards
replenished
.
<EOS>
With
the
aid
of
its
content
,
a
newspaper
,
and
some
skimming
of
the
cream
of
the
pie
-
stock
,
Flora
got
through
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
perfect
good
humour
;
though
occasionally
embarrassed
by
the
consequences
of
an
idle
rumour
which
circulated
among
the
credulous
infants
of
the
neighbourhood
,
to
the
effect
that
an
old
lady
had
sold
herself
to
the
pie
-
shop
to
be
made
up
,
and
was
then
sitting
in
the
pie
-
shop
parlour
,
declining
to
complete
her
contract
.
 
<EOS>
This
attracted
so
many
young
persons
of
both
sexes
,
and
,
when
the
shades
of
evening
began
to
fall
,
occasioned
so
much
interruption
to
the
business
,
that
the
merchant
became
very
pressing
in
his
proposals
that
Mr
F
's
Aunt
should
be
removed
.
 
<EOS>
A
conveyance
was
accordingly
brought
to
the
door
,
which
,
by
the
joint
efforts
of
the
merchant
and
Flora
,
this
remarkable
woman
was
at
last
induced
to
enter
;
though
not
without
even
then
putting
her
head
out
of
the
window
,
and
demanding
to
have
him
"
brought
for'ard
"
for
the
purpose
originally
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
was
observed
at
this
time
to
direct
baleful
glances
towards
the
Marshalsea
,
it
has
been
supposed
that
this
admirably
consistent
female
intended
by
"
him
,
"
Arthur
Clennam
.
   
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
is
mere
speculation
;
who
the
person
was
,
who
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
Mr
F
's
Aunt
's
mind
,
ought
to
have
been
brought
forward
and
never
was
brought
forward
,
will
never
be
positively
known
.
   
<EOS>
The
autumn
days
went
on
,
and
Little
Dorrit
never
came
to
the
Marshalsea
now
and
went
away
without
seeing
him
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
.
   
<EOS>
One
morning
,
as
Arthur
listened
for
the
light
feet
that
every
morning
ascended
winged
to
his
heart
,
bringing
the
heavenly
brightness
of
a
new
love
into
the
room
where
the
old
love
had
wrought
so
hard
and
been
so
true
;
one
morning
,
as
he
listened
,
he
heard
her
coming
,
not
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Arthur
,
"
said
her
delighted
voice
outside
the
door
,
"
I
have
some
one
here
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
bring
some
one
in
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
thought
from
the
tread
there
were
two
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
answered
"
Yes
,
"
and
she
came
in
with
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
Sun
-
browned
and
jolly
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
looked
,
and
he
opened
his
arms
and
folded
Arthur
in
them
,
like
a
sun
-
browned
and
jolly
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
am
all
right
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
after
a
minute
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
it
's
over
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
,
my
dear
fellow
,
confess
at
once
that
you
expected
me
before
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
said
Arthur
;
"
but
<EOS>
Amy
told
me
---
"
"
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
Never
any
other
name
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
It
was
she
who
whispered
it
.
)
   
"
---
<EOS>
But
my
Little
Dorrit
told
me
that
,
without
asking
for
any
further
explanation
,
I
was
not
to
expect
you
until
I
saw
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
see
me
,
my
boy
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
stoutly
;
"
and
now
you
shall
have
any
explanation
and
every
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
was
here
---
came
straight
to
you
from
the
Allongers
and
Marshongers
,
or
I
should
be
ashamed
to
look
you
in
the
face
this
day
,
---
but
you
were
not
in
company
trim
at
the
moment
,
and
I
had
to
start
off
again
to
catch
Doyce
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
Doyce
!
"
sighed
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
call
him
names
that
he
do
n't
deserve
,
"
said
Mr
Meagles
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
poor
;
he
's
doing
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Doyce
is
a
wonderful
fellow
over
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
he
is
making
out
his
case
like
a
house
a
-
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
fallen
on
his
legs
,
has
Dan
.
 
<EOS>
Where
they
do
n't
want
things
done
and
find
a
man
to
do
'em
,
<EOS>
that
man
's
off
his
legs
;
but
where
they
do
want
things
done
and
find
a
man
to
do
'em
,
that
man
's
on
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
have
occasion
to
trouble
the
Circumlocution
Office
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
tell
you
,
Dan
has
done
without
'
em
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
load
you
take
from
my
mind
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
happiness
you
give
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Happiness
?
"
retorted
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
about
happiness
till
you
see
Dan
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
Dan
is
directing
works
and
executing
labours
over
yonder
,
that
it
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
no
public
offender
,
bless
you
,
now
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
medalled
and
ribboned
,
and
starred
and
crossed
,
and
I
don't
<EOS>
-
know
<EOS>
-
what
all'd
,
like
a
born
nobleman
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
must
n't
talk
about
that
over
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
egad
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
shaking
his
head
very
seriously
,
"
he
must
hide
all
those
things
under
lock
and
key
when
he
comes
over
here
.
 
<EOS>
They
wo
n't
do
over
here
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
particular
,
Britannia
is
a
Britannia
in
the
Manger
---
wo
n't
give
her
children
such
distinctions
herself
,
and
wo
n't
allow
them
to
be
seen
when
they
are
given
by
other
countries
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
Dan
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
shaking
his
head
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
wo
n't
do
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
brought
me
(
except
for
Doyce
's
sake
)
twice
what
I
have
lost
,
"
cried
Arthur
,
"
you
would
not
have
given
me
the
pleasure
that
you
give
me
in
this
news
.
"
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
,
of
course
,
"
assented
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
know
that
,
my
good
fellow
,
and
therefore
I
come
out
with
it
in
the
first
burst
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
to
go
back
,
about
catching
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
I
caught
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
Ran
against
him
among
a
lot
of
those
dirty
brown
dogs
in
women
's
nightcaps
a
great
deal
too
big
for
'em
,
calling
themselves
Arabs
and
all
sorts
of
incoherent
races
.
 
<EOS>
YOU
know
'em
!
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
coming
straight
to
me
,
and
I
was
going
to
him
,
and
so
we
came
back
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Doyce
in
England
!
"
exclaimed
Arthur
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mr
Meagles
,
throwing
open
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
worst
man
in
the
world
to
manage
a
thing
of
this
sort
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
have
done
if
I
had
been
in
the
diplomatic
line
---
<EOS>
right
,
perhaps
!
 
<EOS>
The
long
and
short
of
it
is
,
Arthur
,
we
have
both
been
in
England
this
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
go
on
to
ask
where
Doyce
is
at
the
present
moment
,
why
,
my
plain
answer
is
---
here
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
can
breathe
again
at
last
!
"
   
<EOS>
Doyce
darted
in
from
behind
the
door
,
caught
Arthur
by
both
hands
,
and
said
the
rest
for
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
only
three
branches
of
my
subject
,
my
dear
Clennam
,
"
said
Doyce
,
proceeding
to
mould
them
severally
,
with
his
plastic
thumb
,
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
"
and
they
're
soon
disposed
of
.
<EOS>
First
,
not
a
word
more
from
you
about
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
error
in
your
calculations
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
that
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
affects
the
whole
machine
,
and
failure
is
the
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
profit
by
the
failure
,
and
will
avoid
it
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
a
similar
thing
myself
,
in
construction
,
often
.
 
<EOS>
Every
failure
teaches
a
man
something
,
if
he
will
learn
;
and
you
are
too
sensible
a
man
not
to
learn
from
this
failure
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
for
firstly
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
you
should
have
taken
it
so
heavily
to
heart
,
and
reproached
yourself
so
severely
;
I
was
travelling
home
night
and
day
to
put
matters
right
,
with
the
assistance
of
our
friend
,
when
I
fell
in
with
our
friend
as
he
has
informed
you
.
 
<EOS>
Thirdly
.
 
<EOS>
We
two
agreed
,
that
,
after
what
you
had
undergone
,
after
your
distress
of
mind
,
and
after
your
illness
,
it
would
be
a
pleasant
surprise
if
we
could
so
far
keep
quiet
as
to
get
things
perfectly
arranged
without
your
knowledge
,
and
then
come
and
say
that
all
the
affairs
were
smooth
,
that
everything
was
right
,
that
the
business
stood
in
greater
want
of
you
than
ever
it
did
,
and
that
a
new
and
prosperous
career
was
opened
before
you
and
me
as
partners
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
thirdly
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
we
always
make
an
allowance
for
friction
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
have
reserved
space
to
close
in
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Clennam
,
I
thoroughly
confide
in
you
;
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
be
quite
as
useful
to
me
as
I
have
,
or
have
had
,
<EOS>
it
in
my
power
to
be
useful
to
you
;
your
old
place
awaits
you
,
and
wants
you
very
much
;
there
is
nothing
to
detain
you
here
one
half
-
hour
longer
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
silence
,
which
was
not
broken
until
Arthur
had
stood
for
some
time
at
the
window
with
his
back
towards
them
,
and
until
his
little
wife
that
was
to
be
had
gone
to
him
and
stayed
by
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
made
a
remark
a
little
while
ago
,
"
said
Daniel
Doyce
then
,
"
which
I
am
inclined
to
think
was
an
incorrect
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
there
was
nothing
to
detain
you
here
,
Clennam
,
half
an
hour
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
mistaken
in
supposing
that
you
would
rather
not
leave
here
till
to
-
morrow
morning
?
 
<EOS>
Do
I
know
,
without
being
very
wise
,
where
you
would
like
to
go
,
direct
from
these
walls
and
from
this
room
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
"
returned
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
our
cherished
purpose
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
!
"
said
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
if
this
young
lady
will
do
me
the
honour
of
regarding
me
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
in
the
light
of
a
father
,
and
will
take
a
ride
with
me
now
towards
Saint
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
I
dare
say
I
know
what
we
want
to
get
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
<EOS>
and
he
went
out
together
soon
afterwards
,
and
Mr
Meagles
lingered
behind
to
say
a
word
to
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Arthur
,
you
will
not
want
Mother
and
me
in
the
morning
and
we
will
keep
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
set
Mother
thinking
about
Pet
;
she
's
a
soft
-
hearted
woman
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
best
at
the
Cottage
,
and
I
'll
stay
there
and
keep
her
company
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
they
parted
for
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
day
ended
,
and
the
night
ended
,
and
the
morning
came
,
and
Little
Dorrit
,
simply
dressed
as
usual
and
having
no
one
with
her
but
Maggy
,
came
into
the
prison
with
the
sunshine
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
room
was
a
happy
room
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Where
in
the
world
was
there
a
room
so
full
of
quiet
joy
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
love
,
"
said
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
does
Maggy
light
the
fire
?
 
<EOS>
We
shall
be
gone
directly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
asked
her
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
such
an
odd
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
burn
something
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
this
folded
paper
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
put
it
in
the
fire
with
your
own
hand
,
just
as
it
is
,
my
fancy
will
be
gratified
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Superstitious
,
darling
Little
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
a
charm
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
anything
you
like
best
,
my
own
,
"
she
answered
,
laughing
with
glistening
eyes
and
standing
on
tiptoe
to
kiss
him
,
"
if
you
will
only
humour
me
when
the
fire
burns
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
they
stood
before
the
fire
,
waiting
:
Clennam
with
his
arm
about
her
waist
,
and
the
fire
shining
,
as
fire
in
that
same
place
had
often
shone
,
in
Little
Dorrit
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
bright
enough
now
?
"
said
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
bright
enough
now
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Does
the
charm
want
any
words
to
be
said
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Arthur
,
as
he
held
the
paper
over
the
flame
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
say
(
if
you
do
n't
mind
)
<EOS>
"
I
love
you
!
"
answered
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
said
it
,
and
the
paper
burned
away
.
   
<EOS>
They
passed
very
quietly
along
the
yard
;
for
no
one
was
there
,
though
many
heads
were
stealthily
peeping
from
the
windows
.
   
<EOS>
Only
one
face
,
familiar
of
old
,
was
in
the
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
both
accosted
it
,
and
spoken
many
kind
words
,
Little
Dorrit
turned
back
one
last
time
with
her
hand
stretched
out
,
saying
,
"
Good
-
bye
,
good
John
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
live
very
happy
,
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
Then
they
went
up
the
steps
of
the
neighbouring
Saint
George
's
Church
,
and
went
up
to
the
altar
,
where
Daniel
Doyce
was
waiting
in
his
paternal
character
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
was
Little
Dorrit
's
old
friend
who
had
given
her
the
Burial
Register
for
a
pillow
;
full
of
admiration
that
she
should
come
back
to
them
to
be
married
,
after
all
.
   
<EOS>
And
they
were
married
with
the
sun
shining
on
them
through
the
painted
figure
of
Our
Saviour
on
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
went
into
the
very
room
where
Little
Dorrit
had
slumbered
after
her
party
,
to
sign
the
Marriage
Register
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
,
Mr
Pancks
,
(
destined
to
be
chief
clerk
to
Doyce
and
Clennam
,
and
afterwards
partner
in
the
house
)
,
sinking
the
Incendiary
in
the
peaceful
friend
,
looked
in
at
the
door
to
see
it
done
,
with
Flora
gallantly
supported
on
one
arm
and
Maggy
on
the
other
,
and
a
back
-
ground
of
John
Chivery
and
father
and
other
turnkeys
who
had
run
round
for
the
moment
,
deserting
the
parent
Marshalsea
for
its
happy
child
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
had
Flora
the
least
signs
of
seclusion
upon
her
,
notwithstanding
her
recent
declaration
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
was
wonderfully
smart
,
and
enjoyed
the
ceremonies
mightily
,
though
in
a
fluttered
way
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Dorrit
's
old
friend
held
the
inkstand
as
she
signed
her
name
,
and
the
clerk
paused
in
taking
off
the
good
clergyman
's
surplice
,
and
all
the
witnesses
looked
on
with
special
interest
.
<EOS>
"
For
,
you
see
,
"
said
Little
Dorrit
's
old
friend
,
"
this
young
lady
is
one
of
our
curiosities
,
and
has
come
now
to
the
third
volume
of
our
Registers
.
 
<EOS>
Her
birth
is
in
what
I
call
the
first
volume
;
she
lay
asleep
,
on
this
very
floor
,
with
her
pretty
head
on
what
I
call
the
second
volume
;
and
she
's
now
a
-
writing
her
little
name
as
a
bride
in
what
I
call
the
third
volume
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
all
gave
place
when
the
signing
was
done
,
and
Little
Dorrit
and
her
husband
walked
out
of
the
church
alone
.
 
<EOS>
They
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
steps
of
the
portico
,
looking
at
the
fresh
perspective
of
the
street
in
the
autumn
morning
sun
's
bright
rays
,
and
then
went
down
.
   
<EOS>
Went
down
into
a
modest
life
of
usefulness
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Went
down
to
give
a
mother
's
care
,
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
to
Fanny
's
neglected
children
no
less
than
to
their
own
,
and
to
leave
that
lady
going
into
Society
for
ever
and
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
Went
down
to
give
a
tender
nurse
and
friend
to
Tip
for
some
few
years
,
who
was
never
vexed
by
the
great
exactions
he
made
of
her
in
return
for
the
riches
he
might
have
given
her
if
he
had
ever
had
them
,
and
who
lovingly
closed
his
eyes
upon
the
Marshalsea
and
all
its
blighted
fruits
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
quietly
down
into
the
roaring
streets
,
inseparable
and
blessed
;
and
as
they
passed
along
in
sunshine
and
shade
,
the
noisy
and
the
eager
,
and
the
arrogant
and
the
froward
and
the
vain
,
fretted
and
chafed
,
and
made
their
usual
uproar
.
