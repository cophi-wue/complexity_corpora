CHAPTER
I.--THE
BEACON
ON
PENDLE
HILL
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
eight
watchers
by
the
beacon
on
Pendle
Hill
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
Two
were
stationed
on
either
side
of
the
north
-
eastern
extremity
of
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
One
looked
over
the
castled
heights
of
Clithero
;
the
woody
eminences
of
Bowland
;
the
bleak
ridges
of
Thornley
;
the
broad
moors
of
Bleasdale
;
the
Trough
of
Bolland
,
and
Wolf
Crag
;
and
even
brought
within
his
ken
the
black
fells
overhanging
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
The
other
tracked
the
stream
called
Pendle
Water
,
almost
from
its
source
amid
the
neighbouring
hills
,
and
followed
its
windings
through
the
leafless
forest
,
until
it
united
its
waters
to
those
of
the
Calder
,
and
swept
on
in
swifter
and
clearer
current
,
to
wash
the
base
of
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
But
the
watcher
's
survey
did
not
stop
here
.
<EOS>
Noting
the
sharp
spire
of
Burnley
Church
,
relieved
against
the
rounded
masses
of
timber
constituting
Townley
Park
;
as
well
as
the
entrance
of
the
gloomy
mountain
gorge
,
known
as
the
Grange
of
Cliviger
;
his
far
-
reaching
gaze
passed
over
Todmorden
,
and
settled
upon
the
distant
summits
of
Blackstone
Edge
.
 
<EOS>
Dreary
was
the
prospect
on
all
sides
.
<EOS>
Black
moor
,
bleak
fell
,
straggling
forest
,
intersected
with
sullen
streams
as
black
as
ink
,
with
here
and
there
a
small
tarn
,
or
moss
-
pool
,
with
waters
of
the
same
hue
--
<EOS>
these
constituted
the
chief
features
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
whole
district
was
barren
and
thinly
-
populated
.
<EOS>
Of
towns
,
only
Clithero
,
Colne
,
and
Burnley
--
the
latter
little
more
than
a
village
--
were
in
view
.
<EOS>
In
the
valleys
there
were
a
few
hamlets
and
scattered
cottages
,
and
on
the
uplands
an
occasional
"
booth
,
"
as
the
hut
of
the
herdsman
was
termed
;
but
of
more
important
mansions
there
were
only
six
,
as
Merley
,
Twistleton
,
Alcancoats
,
Saxfeld
,
Ightenhill
,
and
Gawthorpe
.
<EOS>
The
"
vaccaries
"
for
the
cattle
,
of
which
the
herdsmen
had
the
care
,
and
the
"
lawnds
,
"
or
parks
within
the
forest
,
appertaining
to
some
of
the
halls
before
mentioned
,
offered
the
only
evidences
of
cultivation
.
<EOS>
All
else
was
heathy
waste
,
morass
,
and
wood
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
in
the
eye
of
the
sportsman
--
and
the
Lancashire
gentlemen
of
the
sixteenth
century
were
keen
lovers
of
sport
--
the
country
had
a
strong
interest
.
<EOS>
Pendle
forest
abounded
with
game
.
<EOS>
Grouse
,
plover
,
and
bittern
were
found
upon
its
moors
;
woodcock
and
snipe
on
its
marshes
;
mallard
,
teal
,
and
widgeon
upon
its
pools
.
<EOS>
In
its
chases
ranged
herds
of
deer
,
protected
by
the
terrible
forest
-
laws
,
then
in
full
force
:
and
the
hardier
huntsman
might
follow
the
wolf
to
his
lair
in
the
mountains
;
might
spear
the
boar
in
the
oaken
glades
,
or
the
otter
on
the
river
's
brink
;
might
unearth
the
badger
or
the
fox
,
or
smite
the
fierce
cat
-
a
-
mountain
with
a
quarrel
from
his
bow
.
<EOS>
A
nobler
victim
sometimes
,
also
,
awaited
him
in
the
shape
of
a
wild
mountain
bull
,
a
denizen
of
the
forest
,
and
a
remnant
of
the
herds
that
had
once
browsed
upon
the
hills
,
but
which
had
almost
all
been
captured
,
and
removed
to
stock
the
park
of
the
Abbot
of
Whalley
.
<EOS>
The
streams
and
pools
were
full
of
fish
:
the
stately
heron
frequented
the
meres
;
and
on
the
craggy
heights
built
the
kite
,
the
falcon
,
and
the
kingly
eagle
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
eight
watchers
by
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
Two
stood
apart
from
the
others
,
looking
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Both
were
armed
with
swords
and
arquebuses
,
and
wore
steel
caps
and
coats
of
buff
.
<EOS>
Their
sleeves
were
embroidered
with
the
five
wounds
of
Christ
,
encircling
the
name
of
Jesus
--
the
badge
of
the
Pilgrimage
of
Grace
.
<EOS>
Between
them
,
on
the
verge
of
the
mountain
,
was
planted
a
great
banner
,
displaying
a
silver
cross
,
the
chalice
,
and
the
Host
,
together
with
an
ecclesiastical
figure
,
but
wearing
a
helmet
instead
of
a
mitre
,
and
holding
a
sword
in
place
of
a
crosier
,
with
the
unoccupied
hand
pointing
to
the
two
towers
of
a
monastic
structure
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
he
was
armed
for
its
defence
.
<EOS>
This
figure
,
as
the
device
beneath
it
showed
,
represented
John
Paslew
,
Abbot
of
Whalley
,
or
,
as
he
styled
himself
in
his
military
capacity
,
Earl
of
Poverty
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
eight
watchers
by
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
Two
have
been
described
.
<EOS>
Of
the
other
six
,
two
were
stout
herdsmen
carrying
crooks
,
and
holding
a
couple
of
mules
,
and
a
richly
-
caparisoned
war
-
horse
by
the
bridle
.
<EOS>
Near
them
stood
a
broad
-
shouldered
,
athletic
young
man
,
with
the
fresh
complexion
,
curling
brown
hair
,
light
eyes
,
and
open
Saxon
countenance
,
best
seen
in
his
native
county
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
Lincoln
-
green
tunic
,
with
a
bugle
suspended
from
the
shoulder
by
a
silken
cord
;
and
a
silver
plate
engraved
with
the
three
luces
,
the
ensign
of
the
Abbot
of
Whalley
,
hung
by
a
chain
from
his
neck
.
<EOS>
A
hunting
knife
was
in
his
girdle
,
and
an
eagle
's
plume
in
his
cap
,
and
he
leaned
upon
the
but
-
end
of
a
crossbow
,
regarding
three
persons
who
stood
together
by
a
peat
fire
,
on
the
sheltered
side
of
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
Two
of
these
were
elderly
men
,
in
the
white
gowns
and
scapularies
of
Cistertian
monks
,
doubtless
from
Whalley
,
as
the
abbey
belonged
to
that
order
.
<EOS>
The
third
and
last
,
and
evidently
their
superior
,
was
a
tall
man
in
a
riding
dress
,
wrapped
in
a
long
mantle
of
black
velvet
,
trimmed
with
minever
,
and
displaying
the
same
badges
as
those
upon
the
sleeves
of
the
sentinels
,
only
wrought
in
richer
material
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
strongly
marked
and
stern
,
and
bore
traces
of
age
;
but
his
eye
was
bright
,
and
his
carriage
erect
and
dignified
.
 
<EOS>
The
beacon
,
near
which
the
watchers
stood
,
consisted
of
a
vast
pile
of
logs
of
timber
,
heaped
upon
a
circular
range
of
stones
,
with
openings
to
admit
air
,
and
having
the
centre
filled
with
fagots
,
and
other
quickly
combustible
materials
.
<EOS>
Torches
were
placed
near
at
hand
,
so
that
the
pile
could
be
lighted
on
the
instant
.
 
<EOS>
The
watch
was
held
one
afternoon
at
the
latter
end
of
November
,
1536
.
<EOS>
In
that
year
had
arisen
a
formidable
rebellion
in
the
northern
counties
of
England
,
the
members
of
which
,
while
engaging
to
respect
the
person
of
the
king
,
Henry
VIII
.
,
and
his
issue
,
bound
themselves
by
solemn
oath
to
accomplish
the
restoration
of
Papal
supremacy
throughout
the
realm
,
and
the
restitution
of
religious
establishments
and
lands
to
their
late
ejected
possessors
.
<EOS>
They
bound
themselves
,
also
,
to
punish
the
enemies
of
the
Romish
church
,
and
suppress
heresy
.
<EOS>
From
its
religious
character
the
insurrection
assumed
the
name
of
the
Pilgrimage
of
Grace
,
and
numbered
among
its
adherents
all
who
had
not
embraced
the
new
doctrines
in
Yorkshire
and
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
That
such
an
outbreak
should
occur
on
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
,
was
not
marvellous
.
<EOS>
The
desecration
and
spoliation
of
so
many
sacred
structures
--
the
destruction
of
shrines
and
images
long
regarded
with
veneration
--
the
ejection
of
so
many
ecclesiastics
,
renowned
for
hospitality
and
revered
for
piety
and
learning
--
the
violence
and
rapacity
of
the
commissioners
appointed
by
the
Vicar
-
General
Cromwell
to
carry
out
these
severe
measures
--
all
these
outrages
were
regarded
by
the
people
with
abhorrence
,
and
disposed
them
to
aid
the
sufferers
in
resistance
.
<EOS>
As
yet
the
wealthier
monasteries
in
the
north
had
been
spared
,
and
it
was
to
preserve
them
from
the
greedy
hands
of
the
visiters
,
Doctors
Lee
and
Layton
,
that
the
insurrection
had
been
undertaken
.
<EOS>
A
simultaneous
rising
took
place
in
Lincolnshire
,
headed
by
Makarel
,
Abbot
of
Barlings
,
but
it
was
speedily
quelled
by
the
vigour
and
skill
of
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
and
its
leader
executed
.
<EOS>
But
the
northern
outbreak
was
better
organized
,
and
of
greater
force
,
for
it
now
numbered
thirty
thousand
men
,
under
the
command
of
a
skilful
and
resolute
leader
named
Robert
Aske
.
 
<EOS>
As
may
be
supposed
,
the
priesthood
were
main
movers
in
a
revolt
having
their
especial
benefit
for
its
aim
;
and
many
of
them
,
following
the
example
of
the
Abbot
of
Barlings
,
clothed
themselves
in
steel
instead
of
woollen
garments
,
and
girded
on
the
sword
and
the
breastplate
for
the
redress
of
their
grievances
and
the
maintenance
of
their
rights
.
<EOS>
Amongst
these
were
the
Abbots
of
Jervaux
,
Furness
,
Fountains
,
Rivaulx
,
and
Salley
,
and
,
lastly
,
the
Abbot
of
Whalley
,
before
mentioned
;
a
fiery
and
energetic
prelate
,
who
had
ever
been
constant
and
determined
in
his
opposition
to
the
aggressive
measures
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
Pilgrimage
of
Grace
,
such
its
design
,
and
such
its
supporters
.
 
<EOS>
Several
large
towns
had
already
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
insurgents
.
<EOS>
York
,
Hull
,
and
Pontefract
had
yielded
;
Skipton
Castle
was
besieged
,
and
defended
by
the
Earl
of
Cumberland
;
and
battle
was
offered
to
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
and
the
Earl
of
Shrewsbury
,
who
headed
the
king
's
forces
at
Doncaster
.
<EOS>
But
the
object
of
the
Royalist
leaders
was
to
temporise
,
and
an
armistice
was
offered
to
the
rebels
and
accepted
.
<EOS>
Terms
were
next
proposed
and
debated
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
continuance
of
this
armistice
all
hostilities
ceased
;
but
beacons
were
reared
upon
the
mountains
,
and
their
fires
were
to
be
taken
as
a
new
summons
to
arms
.
<EOS>
This
signal
the
eight
watchers
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Though
late
in
November
,
the
day
had
been
unusually
fine
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
the
whole
hilly
ranges
around
were
clearly
discernible
,
but
now
the
shades
of
evening
were
fast
drawing
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Night
is
approaching
,
"
cried
the
tall
man
in
the
velvet
mantle
,
impatiently
;
"
and
still
the
signal
comes
not
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
this
delay
?
<EOS>
Can
Norfolk
have
accepted
our
conditions
?
<EOS>
Impossible
.
<EOS>
The
last
messenger
from
our
camp
at
Scawsby
Lees
brought
word
that
the
duke
's
sole
terms
would
be
the
king
's
pardon
to
the
whole
insurgent
army
,
provided
they
at
once
dispersed
--
except
ten
persons
,
six
named
and
four
unnamed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
were
you
amongst
those
named
,
lord
abbot
?
"
demanded
one
of
the
monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
John
Paslew
,
Abbot
of
Whalley
,
<EOS>
it
was
said
,
headed
the
list
,
"
replied
the
other
,
with
a
bitter
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Next
came
William
Trafford
,
Abbot
of
Salley
.
<EOS>
Next
Adam
Sudbury
,
Abbot
of
Jervaux
.
<EOS>
Then
our
leader
,
Robert
Aske
.
<EOS>
Then
John
Eastgate
,
Monk
of
Whalley--
<EOS>
"
 
"
How
,
lord
abbot
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
monk
.
"
<EOS>
Was
my
name
mentioned
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
"
rejoined
the
abbot
.
"
<EOS>
And
that
of
William
Haydocke
,
also
Monk
of
Whalley
,
closed
the
list
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
unrelenting
tyrant
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
the
other
monk
.
"
<EOS>
But
these
terms
could
not
be
accepted
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
not
,
"
replied
Paslew
;
"
they
were
rejected
with
scorn
.
<EOS>
But
the
negotiations
were
continued
by
Sir
Ralph
Ellerker
and
Sir
Robert
Bowas
,
who
were
to
claim
on
our
part
a
free
pardon
for
all
;
the
establishment
of
a
Parliament
and
courts
of
justice
at
York
;
the
restoration
of
the
Princess
Mary
to
the
succession
;
the
Pope
to
his
jurisdiction
;
and
our
brethren
to
their
houses
.
<EOS>
But
such
conditions
will
never
be
granted
.
<EOS>
With
my
consent
no
armistice
should
have
been
agreed
to
.
<EOS>
We
are
sure
to
lose
by
the
delay
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
overruled
by
the
Archbishop
of
York
and
the
Lord
Darcy
.
<EOS>
Their
voices
prevailed
against
the
Abbot
of
Whalley
--
or
,
if
it
please
you
,
the
Earl
of
Poverty
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
assumption
of
that
derisive
title
which
has
drawn
upon
you
the
full
force
of
the
king
's
resentment
,
lord
abbot
,
"
observed
Father
Eastgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
"
replied
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
"
I
took
it
in
mockery
of
Cromwell
and
the
ecclesiastical
commissioners
,
and
I
rejoice
that
they
have
felt
the
sting
.
<EOS>
The
Abbot
of
Barlings
called
himself
Captain
Cobbler
,
because
,
as
he
affirmed
,
the
state
wanted
mending
like
old
shoon
.
<EOS>
And
is
not
my
title
equally
well
chosen
?
<EOS>
Is
not
the
Church
smitten
with
poverty
?
<EOS>
Have
not
ten
thousand
of
our
brethren
been
driven
from
their
homes
to
beg
or
to
starve
?
<EOS>
Have
not
the
houseless
poor
,
whom
we
fed
at
our
gates
,
and
lodged
within
our
wards
,
gone
away
hungry
and
without
rest
?
<EOS>
Have
not
the
sick
,
whom
we
would
have
relieved
,
died
untended
by
the
hedge
-
side
?
<EOS>
I
am
the
head
of
the
poor
in
Lancashire
,
the
redresser
of
their
grievances
,
and
therefore
I
style
myself
Earl
of
Poverty
.
<EOS>
Have
I
not
done
well
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
lord
abbot
,
"
replied
Father
Eastgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poverty
will
not
alone
be
the
fate
of
the
Church
,
but
of
the
whole
realm
,
if
the
rapacious
designs
of
the
monarch
and
his
heretical
counsellors
are
carried
forth
,
"
pursued
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
"
Cromwell
,
Audeley
,
and
Rich
,
have
wisely
ordained
that
no
infant
shall
be
baptised
without
tribute
to
the
king
;
that
no
man
who
owns
not
above
twenty
pounds
a
year
shall
consume
wheaten
bread
,
or
eat
the
flesh
of
fowl
or
swine
without
tribute
;
and
that
all
ploughed
land
shall
pay
tribute
likewise
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
Church
is
to
be
beggared
,
the
poor
plundered
,
and
all
men
burthened
,
to
fatten
the
king
,
and
fill
his
exchequer
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
a
jest
,
"
observed
Father
Haydocke
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
jest
no
man
laughs
at
,
"
rejoined
the
abbot
,
sternly
;
"
any
more
than
the
king
's
counsellors
will
laugh
at
the
Earl
of
Poverty
,
whose
title
they
themselves
have
created
.
<EOS>
But
wherefore
comes
not
the
signal
?
<EOS>
Can
aught
have
gone
wrong
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
think
it
.
<EOS>
The
whole
country
,
from
the
Tweed
to
the
Humber
,
and
from
the
Lune
to
the
Mersey
,
is
ours
;
and
,
if
we
but
hold
together
,
our
cause
must
prevail
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
we
have
many
and
powerful
enemies
,
"
observed
Father
Eastgate
;
"
and
the
king
<EOS>
,
it
is
said
,
hath
sworn
never
to
make
terms
with
us
.
<EOS>
Tidings
were
brought
to
the
abbey
this
morning
,
that
the
Earl
of
Derby
is
assembling
forces
at
Preston
,
to
march
upon
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
give
him
a
warm
reception
if
he
comes
,
"
replied
Paslew
,
fiercely
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
find
that
our
walls
have
not
been
kernelled
and
embattled
by
licence
of
good
King
Edward
the
Third
for
nothing
;
and
that
our
brethren
can
fight
as
well
as
their
predecessors
fought
in
the
time
of
Abbot
Holden
,
when
they
took
tithe
by
force
from
Sir
Christopher
Parsons
of
Slaydburn
.
<EOS>
The
abbey
is
strong
,
and
right
well
defended
,
and
we
need
not
fear
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
But
it
grows
dark
fast
,
and
yet
no
signal
comes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perchance
the
waters
of
the
Don
have
again
risen
,
so
as
to
prevent
the
army
from
fording
the
stream
,
"
observed
Father
Haydocke
;
"
or
it
may
be
that
some
disaster
hath
befallen
our
leader
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
will
not
believe
the
latter
,
"
said
the
abbot
;
"
Robert
Aske
is
chosen
by
Heaven
to
be
our
deliverer
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
prophesied
that
a
'
worm
with
one
eye
'
shall
work
the
redemption
of
the
fallen
faith
,
and
you
know
that
Robert
Aske
hath
been
deprived
of
his
left
orb
by
an
arrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Therefore
it
is
,
"
observed
Father
Eastgate
,
"
that
the
Pilgrims
of
Grace
chant
the
following
ditty:--
           
<EOS>
"
'
Forth
shall
come
an
Aske
with
one
eye
,
          
He
shall
be
chief
of
the
company--
          
Chief
of
the
northern
chivalry
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
more
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
abbot
,
seeing
that
the
monk
appeared
to
hesitate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
know
not
whether
the
rest
of
the
rhymes
may
please
you
,
lord
abbot
,
"
replied
Father
Eastgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
hear
them
,
and
I
will
judge
,
"
said
Paslew
.
<EOS>
Thus
urged
,
the
monk
went
on:--
           
<EOS>
"
'
One
shall
sit
at
a
solemn
feast
,
          
Half
warrior
,
half
priest
,
          
<EOS>
The
greatest
there
shall
be
the
least
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
last
verse
,
"
observed
the
monk
,
"
has
been
added
to
the
ditty
by
Nicholas
Demdike
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
sing
it
the
other
day
at
the
abbey
gate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
Nicholas
Demdike
of
Worston
?
"
cried
the
abbot
;
"
he
whose
wife
is
a
witch
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
same
,
"
replied
Eastgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hoo

"
remarked
the
forester
,
who
had
been
listening
attentively
to
their
discourse
,
and
who
now
stepped
forward
;
"

<EOS>
"
Thou

Cuthbert

"
said
the
abbot
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
impose
a
penance
upon
thee
,
to
free
thee
from
the
evil
influence
.
<EOS>
Thou
must
recite
twenty
paternosters
daily
,
fasting
,
for
one
month
;
and
afterwards
perform
a
pilgrimage
to
the
shrine
of
our
Lady
of
Gilsland
.
<EOS>
Bess
Demdike
is
an
approved
and
notorious
witch
,

hath
been
seen
by
credible
witnesses
attending
a
devil

on

<EOS>
Heaven

<EOS>
It
is
therefore
that
I
have
placed
her
and
her
husband
under
the
ban
of
the
Church
;
pronounced
sentence
of
excommunication
against
them

commanded

said
the
abbot
;
"
yet
I
wish
to
confront
him
,
and
charge
him
with
his
midemeanours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
;
he
sings
,
"
cried
Father
Haydocke
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
a
voice
was
heard
chanting,--
           
<EOS>
"
One
shall
sit
at
a
solemn
feast
,
          
Half
warrior
,
half
priest
,
          
<EOS>
The
greatest
there
shall
be
the
least
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
very
ditty
I
heard
,
"
cried
Father
Eastgate
;
"
<EOS>
but
list
,
he
has
more
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
voice
resumed,--
           
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
rich
,
yet
poor
as
me
,
          
Abbot
,
and
Earl
of
Poverty
.
          
<EOS>
Monk
and
soldier
,
rich
and
poor
,
          
<EOS>
He
shall
be
hang'd
at
his
own
door
.
"
 
<EOS>
Loud
derisive
laughter
followed
the
song
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
our
Lady
of
Whalley
,
the
knave
is
mocking
us
,
"
cried
the
abbot
;
"
send
a
bolt
to
silence
him
,
Cuthbert
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
forester
instantly
bent
his
bow
,
and
a
quarrel
whistled
off
in
the
direction
of
the
singer
;
but
whether
his
aim
were
not
truly
taken
,
or
he
meant
not
to
hit
the
mark
,
it
is
certain
that
Demdike
remained
untouched
.
<EOS>
The
reputed
wizard
laughed
aloud
,
took
off
his
felt
cap
in
acknowledgment
,
and
marched
deliberately
down
the
side
of
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
not
wo
nt
to
miss
thy
aim
,
Cuthbert
,
"
cried
the
abbot
,
with
a
look
of
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"
Take
good
heed
thou
producest
<EOS>
this
scurril
knave
before
me
,
when
these
troublous
times
are
over
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
this?--he
stops
--
ha
!
<EOS>
he
is
practising
his
devilries
on
the
mountain
's
side
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
would
seem
that
the
abbot
had
good
warrant
for
what
he
said
,
as
Demdike
,
having
paused
at
a
broad
green
patch
on
the
hill
-
side
,
was
now
busied
in
tracing
a
circle
round
it
with
his
staff
.
<EOS>
He
then
spoke
aloud
some
words
,
which
the
superstitious
beholders
construed
into
an
incantation
,
and
after
tracing
the
circle
once
again
,
and
casting
some
tufts
of
dry
heather
,
which
he
plucked
from
an
adjoining
hillock
,
on
three
particular
spots
,
he
ran
quickly
downwards
,
followed
by
his
hound
,
and
leaping
a
stone
wall
,
surrounding
a
little
orchard
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
disappeared
from
view
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
and
see
what
he
hath
done
,
"
cried
the
abbot
to
the
forester
,
"
for
I
like
it
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ashbead
instantly
obeyed
,
and
on
reaching
the
green
spot
in
question
,
shouted
out
that
he
could
discern
nothing
;
but
presently
added
,
as
he
moved
about
,
that
the
turf
heaved
like
a
sway
-
bed
beneath
his
feet
,
and
he
thought
--
to
use
his
own
phraseology
--
would
"
brast
.
"
<EOS>
The
abbot
then
commanded
him
to
go
down
to
the
orchard
below
,
and
if
he
could
find
Demdike
to
bring
him
to
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
The
forester
did
as
he
was
bidden
,
ran
down
the
hill
,
and
,
leaping
the
orchard
wall
as
the
other
had
done
,
was
lost
to
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
it
became
quite
dark
,
and
as
Ashbead
did
not
reappear
,
the
abbot
gave
vent
to
his
impatience
and
uneasiness
,
and
was
proposing
to
send
one
of
the
herdsmen
in
search
of
him
,
when
his
attention
was
suddenly
diverted
by
a
loud
shout
from
one
of
the
sentinels
,
and
a
fire
was
seen
on
a
distant
hill
on
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
signal
!
<EOS>
the
signal
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Paslew
,
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"
Kindle
a
torch!--quick
,
quick
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
seized
a
brand
and
plunged
it
into
the
peat
fire
,
while
his
example
was
followed
by
the
two
monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
beacon
on
Blackstone
Edge
,
"
cried
the
abbot
;
"
and
look
!
<EOS>
a
second
blazes
over
the
Grange
of
Cliviger
--
another
on
Ightenhill--
another
on
Boulsworth
Hill
--
and
the
last
on
the
neighbouring
heights
of
Padiham
.
<EOS>
Our
own
comes
next
.
<EOS>
May
it
light
the
enemies
of
our
holy
Church
to
perdition
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
applied
the
burning
brand
to
the
combustible
matter
of
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
The
monks
did
the
same
;
and
in
an
instant
a
tall
,
pointed
flame
,
rose
up
from
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
.
<EOS>
Ere
another
minute
had
elapsed
,
similar
fires
shot
up
to
the
right
and
the
left
,
on
the
high
lands
of
Trawden
Forest
,
on
the
jagged
points
of
Foulridge
,
on
the
summit
of
Cowling
Hill
,
and
so
on
to
Skipton
.
<EOS>
Other
fires
again
blazed
on
the
towers
of
Clithero
,
on
Longridge
and
Ribchester
,
on
the
woody
eminences
of
Bowland
,
on
Wolf
Crag
,
and
on
fell
and
scar
all
the
way
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
the
work
of
enchantment
,
so
suddenly
and
so
strangely
did
the
fires
shoot
forth
.
<EOS>
As
the
beacon
flame
increased
,
it
lighted
up
the
whole
of
the
extensive
table
-
land
on
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
;
and
a
long
lurid
streak
fell
on
the
darkling
moss
-
pool
near
which
the
wizard
had
stood
.
<EOS>
But
when
it
attained
its
utmost
height
,
it
revealed
the
depths
of
the
forest
below
,
and
a
red
reflection
,
here
and
there
,
marked
the
course
of
Pendle
Water
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
of
the
abbot
and
his
companions
momently
increased
,
and
the
sentinels
shouted
as
each
new
beacon
was
lighted
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
almost
every
hill
had
its
watch
-
fire
,
and
so
extraordinary
was
the
spectacle
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
weird
beings
were
abroad
,
and
holding
their
revels
on
the
heights
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
the
abbot
,
mounting
his
steed
,
called
out
to
the
monks--"Holy
fathers
,
you
will
follow
to
the
abbey
as
you
may
.
<EOS>
I
shall
ride
fleetly
on
,
and
despatch
two
hundred
archers
to
Huddersfield
and
Wakefield
.
<EOS>
The
abbots
of
Salley
and
Jervaux
,
with
the
Prior
of
Burlington
,
will
be
with
me
at
midnight
,
and
at
daybreak
we
shall
march
our
forces
to
join
the
main
army
.
<EOS>
Heaven
be
with
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
harsh
,
imperious
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Stay
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
to
his
surprise
,
the
abbot
beheld
Nicholas
Demdike
standing
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
wizard
was
dark
and
forbidding
,
and
,
seen
by
the
beacon
light
,
his
savage
features
,
blazing
eyes
,
tall
gaunt
frame
,
and
fantastic
garb
,
made
him
look
like
something
unearthly
.
<EOS>
Flinging
his
staff
over
his
shoulder
,
he
slowly
approached
,
with
his
black
hound
following
close
by
at
his
heels
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
caution
to
give
you
,
lord
abbot
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
hear
me
speak
before
you
set
out
for
the
abbey
,
or
ill
will
befall
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ill
_
<EOS>
will
_
befall
me
if
I
listen
to
thee
,
thou
wicked
churl
,
"
cried
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
"
What
hast
thou
done
with
Cuthbert
Ashbead
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
nothing
of
him
since
he
sent
a
bolt
after
me
at
your
bidding
,
lord
abbot
,
"
replied
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beware
lest
any
harm
come
to
him
,
or
thou
wilt
<EOS>
rue
it
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Paslew
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
no
time
to
waste
on
thee
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
fathers
.
<EOS>
High
mass
will
be
said
in
the
convent
church
before
we
set
out
on
the
expedition
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
You
will
both
attend
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
set
out
upon
the
expedition
,
lord
abbot
,
"
cried
Demdike
,
planting
his
staff
so
suddenly
into
the
ground
before
the
horse
's
head
that
the
animal
reared
and
nearly
threw
his
rider
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
now
,
fellow
,
what
mean
you
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
abbot
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
warn
you
,
"
replied
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
aside
,
"
cried
the
abbot
,
spurring
his
steed
,
"
or
I
will
trample
you
beneath
my
horse
's
feet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
might
let
you
ride
to
your
own
doom
,
"
rejoined
Demdike
,
with
a
scornful
laugh
,
as
he
seized
the
abbot
's
bridle
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
shall
hear
me
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
you
will
never
go
forth
on
this
expedition
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
,
ere
to
-
morrow
,
Whalley
Abbey
will
have
passed
for
ever
from
your
possession
;
and
that
,
if
you
go
thither
again
,
your
life
will
be
forfeited
.
<EOS>
Now
will
you
listen
to
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
wrong
in
doing
so
,
"
cried
the
abbot
,
who
could
not
,
however
,
repress
some
feelings
of
misgiving
at
this
alarming
address
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
what
would
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
Come
out
of
earshot
of
the
others
,
and
I
will
tell
you
,
"
replied
Demdike
.
<EOS>
And
he
led
the
abbot
's
horse
to
some
distance
further
on
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
cause
will
fail
,
lord
abbot
,
"
he
then
said
.
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
it
is
lost
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lost
!
"
cried
the
abbot
,
out
of
all
patience
.
"
<EOS>
Lost
!
<EOS>
Look
around
.
<EOS>
Twenty
fires
are
in
sight
--
ay
,
thirty
,
and
every
fire
thou
seest
will
summon
a
hundred
men
,
at
the
least
,
to
arms
.
<EOS>
Before
an
hour
,
five
hundred
men
will
be
gathered
before
the
gates
of
Whalley
Abbey
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
Demdike
;
"
but
they
will
not
own
the
Earl
of
Poverty
for
their
leader
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
leader
will
they
own
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
abbot
,
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Earl
of
Derby
,
"
replied
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
on
his
way
thither
with
Lord
Mounteagle
from
Preston
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Paslew
,
"
let
me
go
meet
them
,
then
.
<EOS>
But
thou
triflest
with
me
,
fellow
.
<EOS>
Thou
canst
know
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
Whence
gott'st
thou
thine
information
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
it
not
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
thou
wilt
find
it
correct
.
<EOS>
I
tell
thee
,
proud
abbot
,
that
this
grand
scheme
of
thine
and
of
thy
fellows
,
for
the
restitution
of
the
Catholic
Church
,
has
failed
--
utterly
failed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
thee
thou
liest
,
false
knave
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
abbot
,
striking
him
on
the
hand
with
his
scourge
.
"
<EOS>
Quit
thy
hold
,
and
let
me
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
till
I
have
done
,
"
replied
Demdike
,
maintaining
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
"
Well
hast
thou
styled
thyself
Earl
of
Poverty
,
for
thou
art
poor
and
miserable
enough
.
<EOS>
Abbot
of
Whalley
thou
art
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Thy
possessions
will
be
taken
from
thee
,
and
if
thou
returnest
thy
life
also
will
be
taken
.
<EOS>
If
thou
fleest
,
a
price
will
be
set
upon
thy
head
.
<EOS>
I
alone
can
save
thee
,
and
I
will
do
so
on
one
condition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Condition
!
<EOS>
make
conditions
with
thee
,
bond
-
slave
of
Satan
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
abbot
,
gnashing
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
I
reproach
myself
that
I
have
listened
to
thee
so
long
.
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
or
I
will
strike
thee
dead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
wholly
in
my
power
,
"
cried
Demdike
with
a
disdainful
laugh
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
he
pressed
the
large
sharp
bit
against
the
charger
's
mouth
,
and
backed
him
quickly
to
the
very
edge
of
the
hill
,
the
sides
of
which
here
sloped
precipitously
down
.
<EOS>
The
abbot
would
have
uttered
a
cry
,
but
surprise
and
terror
kept
him
silent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
it
my
desire
to
injure
you
,
I
could
cast
you
down
the
mountain
-
side
to
certain
death
,
"
pursued
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
no
such
wish
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
will
serve
you
,
as
I
have
said
,
on
one
condition
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
condition
would
imperil
my
soul
,
"
said
the
abbot
,
full
of
wrath
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thou
seekest
in
vain
to
terrify
me
into
compliance
.
<EOS>
_
Vade
retro
,
Sathanas
_
.
<EOS>
I
defy
thee
and
all
thy
works

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Demdike
laughed
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
thunders
of
the
Church
do
not
frighten
me
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
look
,
"
he
added
,
"
you
doubted
my
word
when
I
told
you
the
rising
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
The
beacon
fires
on
Boulsworth
Hill
and
on
the
Grange
of
Cliviger
are
extinguished
;
that
on
Padiham
Heights
is
expiring
--
<EOS>
nay
,
it
is
out
;
and
ere
many
minutes
<EOS>
all
these
mountain
watch
-
fires
will
have
disappeared
like
lamps
at
the
close
of
a
feast
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
our
Lady
,
it
is
so
,
"
cried
the
abbot
,
in
increasing
terror
.
<EOS>
"
What
new
jugglery
is
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
jugglery
,
I
tell
you
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
waters
of
the
Don
have
again
arisen
;
the
insurgents
have
accepted
the
king
's
pardon
,
have
deserted
their
leaders
,
and
dispersed
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
rising
to
-
night
or
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
The
abbots
of
Jervaux
and
Salley
will
strive
to
capitulate
,
but
in
vain

<EOS>
The
Pilgrimage
of
Grace
is
ended

The
stake
for
which
thou
playedst
is
lost
.
<EOS>
Thirty
years
hast
thou
governed
here
,
but
thy
rule
is
over
.
<EOS>
Seventeen
abbots
have
there
been
of
Whalley
--
the
last
thou!--but
there
shall
be
none
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
the
Demon
in
person
that
speaks
thus
to
me
,
"
cried
the
abbot
,
his
hair
bristling
on
his
head
,
and
a
cold
perspiration
bursting
from
his
pores
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
who
I
am
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
I
have
said
I
will
aid
thee
on
one
condition
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
much
.
<EOS>
Remove
thy
ban
from
my
wife
,
and
baptise
her
infant
daughter
,
and
I
am
content
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
ask
thee
for
this
service
,
slight
though
it
be
,
but
the
poor
soul
hath
set
her
mind
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Wilt
thou
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
abbot
,
shuddering
;
"
I
will
not
baptise
a
daughter
of
Satan
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
sell
my
soul
to
the
powers
of
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
adjure
thee
to
depart
from
me
,
and
tempt
me
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vainly
thou
seekest
to
cast
me
off
,
"
rejoined
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
deliver
thine
adversaries
into
thine
hands
,
and
revenge
thee
upon
them
?
<EOS>
Even
now
there
are
a
party
of
armed
men
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
to
seize
thee
and
thy
brethren
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
show
thee
how
to
destroy
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
they
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
abbot
,
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
"
Their
leaders
are
John
Braddyll
and
Richard
Assheton
,
who
shall
divide
Whalley
Abbey
between
them
,
if
thou
stayest
them
not
,
"
replied
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hell
consume
them
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
speech
shows
consent
,
"
rejoined
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
Come
this
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
without
awaiting
the
abbot
's
reply
,
he
dragged
his
horse
towards
the
but
-
end
of
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
As
they
went
on
,
the
two
monks
,
who
had
been
filled
with
surprise
at
the
interview
,
though
they
did
not
dare
to
interrupt
it
,
advanced
towards
their
superior
,
and
looked
earnestly
and
inquiringly
at
him
,
but
he
remained
silent
;
while
to
the
men
-
at
-
arms
and
the
herdsmen
,
who
demanded
whether
their
own
beacon
-
fire
should
be
extinguished
as
the
others
had
been
,
he
answered
moodily
in
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
foes
you
spoke
of
?
"
he
asked
with
some
uneasiness
,
as
Demdike
led
his
horse
slowly
and
carefully
down
the
hill
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
anon
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
taking
me
to
the
spot
where
you
traced
the
magic
circle
,
"
cried
Paslew
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
from
its
unnaturally
green
hue
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
thither
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
you
should
,
lord
abbot
,
"
replied
Demdike
,
halting
.
<EOS>
"
Remain
on
this
firm
ground
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
be
not
alarmed
;
you
are
in
no
danger
.
<EOS>
Now
bid
your
men
advance
,
and
prepare
their
weapons
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
would
have
demanded
wherefore
,
but
at
a
glance
from
Demdike
he
complied
,
and
the
two
men
-
at
-
arms
,
and
the
herdsmen
,
arranged
themselves
beside
him
,
while
Fathers
Eastgate
and
Haydocke
,
who
had
gotten
upon
their
mules
,
took
up
a
position
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
they
thus
placed
,
when
a
loud
shout
was
raised
below
,
and
a
band
of
armed
men
,
to
the
number
of
thirty
or
forty
,
leapt
the
stone
wall
,
and
began
to
scale
the
hill
with
great
rapidity
.
<EOS>
They
came
up
a
deep
dry
channel
,
apparently
worn
in
the
hill
-
side
by
some
former
torrent
,
and
which
led
directly
to
the
spot
where
Demdike
and
the
abbot
stood
.
<EOS>
The
beacon
-
fire
still
blazed
brightly
,
and
illuminated
the
whole
proceeding
,
showing
that
these
men
,
from
their
accoutrements
,
were
royalist
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stir
not
,
as
you
value
your
life
,
"
said
the
wizard
to
Paslew
;
"
but
observe
what
shall
follow
.
"
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
II.--THE
ERUPTION
.
  
<EOS>
Demdike
went
a
little
further
down
the
hill
,
stopping
when
he
came
to
the
green
patch
.
<EOS>
He
then
plunged
his
staff
into
the
sod
at
the
first
point
where
he
had
cast
a
tuft
of
heather
,
and
with
such
force
that
it
sank
more
than
three
feet
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
he
plucked
it
forth
,
as
if
with
a
great
effort
,
and
a
jet
of
black
water
spouted
into
the
air
;
but
,
heedless
of
this
,
he
went
to
the
next
marked
spot
,
and
again
plunged
the
sharp
point
of
the
implement
into
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Again
it
sank
to
the
same
depth
,
and
,
on
being
drawn
out
,
a
second
black
jet
sprung
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
hostile
party
continued
to
advance
up
the
dry
channel
before
mentioned
,
and
shouted
on
beholding
these
strange
preparations
,
but
they
did
not
relax
their
speed
.
<EOS>
Once
more
the
staff
sank
into
the
ground
,
and
a
third
black
fountain
followed
its
extraction
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
royalist
soldiers
were
close
at
hand
,
and
the
features
of
their
two
leaders
,
John
Braddyll
and
Richard
Assheton
,
could
be
plainly
distinguished
,
and
their
voices
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
he
!
'
<EOS>
tis
the
rebel
abbot
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Braddyll
,
pressing
forward
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
not
misinformed
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
watching
by
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
The
devil
has
delivered
him
into
our
hands
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ho
!
ho
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Abbot
no
longer--'tis
the
Earl
of
Poverty
<EOS>
you
mean
,
"
responded
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
The
villain
shall
be
gibbeted
on
the
spot
where
he
has
fired
the
beacon
,
as
a
warning
to
all
traitors
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
heretics!--ha
,
blasphemers!--I
can
at
least
avenge
myself
upon
you
,
"
cried
Paslew
,
striking
spurs
into
his
charger
.
<EOS>
But
ere
he
could
execute
his
purpose
,
Demdike
had
sprung
backward
,
and
,
catching
the
bridle
,
restrained
the
animal
by
a
powerful
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
"
or
you
will
share
their
fate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
dull
,
booming
,
subterranean
sound
was
heard
,
and
instantly
afterwards
,
with
a
crash
like
thunder
,
the
whole
of
the
green
circle
beneath
slipped
off
,
and
from
a
yawning
rent
under
it
burst
forth
with
irresistible
fury
,
a
thick
inky
-
coloured
torrent
,
which
,
rising
almost
breast
high
,
fell
upon
the
devoted
royalist
soldiers
,
who
were
advancing
right
in
its
course
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
avoid
the
watery
eruption
,
or
to
resist
its
fury
when
it
came
upon
them
,
they
were
instantly
swept
from
their
feet
,
and
carried
down
the
channel
.
 
<EOS>
A
sight
of
horror
was
it
to
behold
the
sudden
rise
of
that
swarthy
stream
,
whose
waters
,
tinged
by
the
ruddy
glare
of
the
beacon
-
fire
,
looked
like
waves
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Nor
less
fearful
was
it
to
hear
the
first
wild
despairing
cry
raised
by
the
victims
,
or
the
quickly
stifled
shrieks
and
groans
that
followed
,
mixed
with
the
deafening
roar
of
the
stream
,
and
the
crashing
fall
of
the
stones
,
which
accompanied
its
course
.
<EOS>
Down
,
down
went
the
poor
wretches
,
now
utterly
overwhelmed
by
the
torrent
,
now
regaining
their
feet
only
to
utter
a
scream
,
and
then
be
swept
off
.
<EOS>
Here
a
miserable
struggler
,
whirled
onward
,
would
clutch
at
the
banks
and
try
to
scramble
forth
,
but
the
soft
turf
giving
way
beneath
him
,
he
was
hurried
off
to
eternity
.
 
<EOS>
At
another
point
where
the
stream
encountered
some
trifling
opposition
,
some
two
or
three
managed
to
gain
a
footing
,
but
they
were
unable
to
extricate
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
vast
quantity
of
boggy
soil
brought
down
by
the
current
,
and
which
rapidly
collected
here
,
embedded
them
and
held
them
fast
,
so
that
the
momently
deepening
water
,
already
up
to
their
chins
,
threatened
speedy
immersion
.
<EOS>
Others
were
stricken
down
by
great
masses
of
turf
,
or
huge
rocky
fragments
,
which
,
bounding
from
point
to
point
with
the
torrent
,
bruised
or
crushed
all
they
encountered
,
or
,
lodging
in
some
difficult
place
,
slightly
diverted
the
course
of
the
torrent
,
and
rendered
it
yet
more
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
of
these
stones
,
larger
than
the
rest
,
which
had
been
stopped
in
its
course
,
a
man
contrived
to
creep
,
and
with
difficulty
kept
his
post
amid
the
raging
flood
.
<EOS>
Vainly
did
he
extend
his
hand
to
such
of
his
fellows
as
were
swept
shrieking
past
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
lend
them
aid
,
while
his
own
position
was
so
desperately
hazardous
that
he
did
not
dare
to
quit
it
.
<EOS>
To
leap
on
either
bank
was
impossible
,
and
to
breast
the
headlong
stream
certain
death
.
 
<EOS>
On
goes
the
current
,
madly
,
furiously
,
as
if
rejoicing
in
the
work
of
destruction
,
while
the
white
foam
of
its
eddies
presents
a
fearful
contrast
to
the
prevailing
blackness
of
the
surface
.
<EOS>
Over
the
last
declivity
it
leaps
,
hissing
,
foaming
,
crashing
like
an
avalanche
.
<EOS>
The
stone
wall
for
a
moment
opposes
its
force
,
but
falls
the
next
,
with
a
mighty
splash
,
carrying
the
spray
far
and
wide
,
while
its
own
fragments
roll
onwards
with
the
stream
.
<EOS>
The
trees
of
the
orchard
are
uprooted
in
an
instant
,
and
an
old
elm
falls
prostrate
.
<EOS>
The
outbuildings
of
a
cottage
are
invaded
,
and
the
porkers
and
cattle
,
divining
their
danger
,
squeal
and
bellow
in
affright
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
quickly
silenced
.
<EOS>
The
resistless
foe
has
broken
down
wall
and
door
,
and
buried
the
poor
creatures
in
mud
and
rubbish
.
 
<EOS>
The
stream
next
invades
the
cottage
,
breaks
in
through
door
and
window
,
and
filling
all
the
lower
part
of
the
tenement
,
in
a
few
minutes
converts
it
into
a
heap
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
On
goes
the
destroyer
,
tearing
up
more
trees
,
levelling
more
houses
,
and
filling
up
a
small
pool
,
till
the
latter
bursts
its
banks
,
and
,
with
an
accession
to
its
force
,
pours
itself
into
a
mill
-
dam
.
<EOS>
Here
its
waters
are
stayed
until
they
find
a
vent
underneath
,
and
the
action
of
the
stream
,
as
it
rushes
downwards
through
this
exit
,
forms
a
great
eddy
above
,
in
which
swim
some
living
things
,
cattle
and
sheep
from
the
fold
not
yet
drowned
,
mixed
with
furniture
from
the
cottages
,
and
amidst
them
the
bodies
of
some
of
the
unfortunate
men
-
at
-
arms
which
have
been
washed
hither
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
ha
!
<EOS>
another
thundering
crash
.
<EOS>
The
dam
has
burst
.
<EOS>
The
torrent
roars
and
rushes
on
furiously
as
before
,
joins
its
forces
with
Pendle
Water
,
swells
up
the
river
,
and
devastates
the
country
far
and
wide.[1
]
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
and
his
companions
beheld
this
work
of
destruction
with
amazement
and
dread
.
<EOS>
Blanched
terror
sat
in
their
cheeks
,
and
the
blood
was
frozen
in
Paslew
's
veins
;
for
he
thought
it
the
work
of
the
powers
of
darkness
,
and
that
he
was
leagued
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
mutter
a
prayer
,
but
his
lips
refused
their
office
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
moved
,
but
his
limbs
were
stiffened
and
paralysed
,
and
he
could
only
gaze
aghast
at
the
terrible
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
Amidst
it
all
he
heard
a
wild
burst
of
unearthly
laughter
,
proceeding
,
he
thought
,
from
Demdike
,
and
it
filled
him
with
new
dread
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
check
the
sound
,
neither
could
he
stop
his
ears
,
though
he
would
fain
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
Like
him
,
his
companions
were
petrified
and
speechless
with
fear
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
had
endured
for
some
time
,
though
still
the
black
torrent
rushed
on
impetuously
as
ever
,
Demdike
turned
to
the
abbot
and
said,--
 
<EOS>
"
Your
vengeance
has
been
fully
gratified
.
<EOS>
You
will
now
baptise
my
child
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
never
,
accursed
being
!
"
shrieked
the
abbot
.
"
<EOS>
Thou
mayst
sacrifice
her
at
thine
own
impious
rites
.
<EOS>
But
see
,
there
is
one
poor
wretch
yet
struggling
with
the
foaming
torrent
.
<EOS>
I
may
save
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
John
Braddyll
,
thy
worst
enemy
,
"
replied
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
lives
he
shall
possess
half
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Thou
hadst
best
also
save
Richard
Assheton
,
who
yet
clings
to
the
great
stone
below
,
as
if
he
escapes
he
shall
have
the
other
half
.
<EOS>
Mark
him
,
and
make
haste
,
for
in
five
minutes
both
shall
be
gone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
save
them
if
I
can
,
be
the
consequence
to
myself
what
it
may
,
"
replied
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
regardless
of
the
derisive
laughter
of
the
other
,
who
yelled
in
his
ears
as
he
went
,
"
Bess
shall
see
thee
hanged
at
thy
own
door
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
dashed
down
the
hill
to
the
spot
where
a
small
object
,
distinguishable
above
the
stream
,
showed
that
some
one
still
kept
his
head
above
water
,
his
tall
stature
having
preserved
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
,
John
Braddyll
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
abbot
,
as
he
rode
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
for
the
wrong
I
intended
you
,
and
deliver
me
from
this
great
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
for
that
purpose
,
"
replied
the
abbot
,
dismounting
,
and
disencumbering
himself
of
his
heavy
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
two
herdsmen
had
come
up
,
and
the
abbot
,
taking
a
crook
from
one
of
them
,
clutched
hold
of
the
fellow
,
and
,
plunging
fearlessly
into
the
stream
,
extended
it
towards
the
drowning
man
,
who
instantly
lifted
up
his
hand
to
grasp
it
.
<EOS>
In
doing
so
Braddyll
lost
his
balance
,
but
,
as
he
did
not
quit
his
hold
,
he
was
plucked
forth
from
the
tenacious
mud
by
the
combined
efforts
of
the
abbot
and
his
assistant
,
and
with
some
difficulty
dragged
ashore
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
for
the
other
,
"
cried
Paslew
,
as
he
placed
Braddyll
in
safety
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
-
half
the
abbey
is
gone
from
thee
,
"
shouted
a
voice
in
his
ears
as
he
rushed
on
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
he
reached
the
rocky
fragment
on
which
Ralph
Assheton
rested
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
in
great
danger
from
the
surging
torrent
,
and
the
stone
on
which
he
had
taken
refuge
tottered
at
its
base
,
and
threatened
to
roll
over
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
Heaven
's
name
,
help
me
,
lord
abbot
,
as
thou
thyself
shall
be
holpen
at
thy
need
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Assheton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
not
afraid
,
Richard
Assheton
,
"
replied
Paslew
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
deliver
thee
as
I
have
delivered
John
Braddyll
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
task
was
not
of
easy
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
The
abbot
made
his
preparations
as
before
;
grasped
the
hand
of
the
herdsman
and
held
out
the
crook
to
Assheton
;
but
when
the
latter
caught
it
,
the
stream
swung
him
round
with
such
force
that
the
abbot
must
either
abandon
him
or
advance
further
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
Bent
on
Assheton
's
preservation
,
he
adopted
the
latter
expedient
,
and
instantly
lost
his
feet
;
while
the
herdsman
,
unable
longer
to
hold
him
,
let
go
the
crook
,
and
the
abbot
and
Assheton
were
swept
down
the
stream
together
.
 
<EOS>
Down
--
down
they
went
,
destruction
apparently
awaiting
them
;
but
the
abbot
,
though
sometimes
quite
under
the
water
,
and
bruised
by
the
rough
stones
and
gravel
with
which
he
came
in
contact
,
still
retained
his
self
-
possession
,
and
encouraged
his
companion
to
hope
for
succour
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
were
borne
down
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
the
monks
,
the
herdsmen
,
and
the
men
-
at
-
arms
having
given
them
up
as
lost
.
<EOS>
But
they
yet
lived
--
yet
floated
--
though
greatly
injured
,
and
almost
senseless
,
when
they
were
cast
into
a
pool
formed
by
the
eddying
waters
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Here
,
wholly
unable
to
assist
himself
,
Assheton
was
seized
by
a
black
hound
belonging
to
a
tall
man
who
stood
on
the
bank
,
and
who
shouted
to
Paslew
,
as
he
helped
the
animal
to
bring
the
drowning
man
ashore
,
"
The
other
half
of
the
abbey
is
gone
from
thee
.
<EOS>
Wilt
thou
baptise
my
child
if
I
send
my
dog
to
save
thee
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
replied
the
other
,
sinking
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
Flashes
of
fire
glanced
in
the
abbot
's
eyes
,
and
stunning
sounds
seemed
to
burst
his
ears
.
<EOS>
A
few
more
struggles
,
and
he
became
senseless
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
destined
to
die
thus
.
<EOS>
What
happened
afterwards
he
knew
not
;
but
when
he
recovered
full
consciousness
,
he
found
himself
stretched
,
with
aching
limbs
and
throbbing
head
,
upon
a
couch
in
a
monastic
room
,
with
a
richly
-
painted
and
gilded
ceiling
,
with
shields
at
the
corners
emblazoned
with
the
three
luces
of
Whalley
,
and
with
panels
hung
with
tapestry
from
the
looms
of
Flanders
,
representing
divers
Scriptural
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
been
dreaming
?
"
<EOS>
he
murmured
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
a
tall
man
standing
by
his
bedside
;
"
thou
hast
been
saved
from
one
death
to
suffer
another
more
ignominious
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
cried
the
abbot
,
starting
up
and
pressing
his
hand
to
his
temples
;
"
thou
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
I
am
appointed
to
watch
thee
,
"
replied
Demdike
.
"
<EOS>
Thou
art
a
prisoner
in
thine
own
chamber
at
Whalley
.
<EOS>
All
has
befallen
as
I
told
thee
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derby
is
master
of
the
abbey
;
thy
adherents
are
dispersed
;
and
thy
brethren
are
driven
forth
.
<EOS>
Thy
two
partners
in
rebellion
,
the
abbots
of
Jervaux
and
Salley
,
have
been
conveyed
to
Lancaster
Castle
,
whither
thou
wilt
go
as
soon
as
thou
canst
be
moved
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
surrender
all
--
silver
and
gold
,
land
and
possessions
--
to
the
king
,
if
I
may
die
in
peace
,
"
groaned
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
needed
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Attainted
of
felony
,
thy
lands
and
abbey
will
be
forfeited
to
the
crown
,
and
they
shall
be
sold
,
as
I
have
told
thee
,
to
John
Braddyll
and
Richard
Assheton
,
who
will
be
rulers
here
in
thy
stead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
I
had
perished
in
the
flood
!
"
groaned
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
mayst
thou
wish
so
,
"
returned
his
tormentor
;
"
but
thou
wert
not
destined
to
die
by
water
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
said
,
thou
shalt
be
hanged
at
thy
own
door
,
and
my
wife
shall
witness
thy
end
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
art
thou
?
<EOS>
I
have
heard
thy
voice
before
,
"
cried
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
like
the
voice
of
one
whom
I
knew
years
ago
,
and
thy
features
are
like
his
--
though
changed
--
greatly
changed
.
<EOS>
Who
art
thou
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
shalt
know
before
thou
diest
,
"
replied
the
other
,
with
a
look
of
gratified
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Farewell
,
and
reflect
upon
thy
fate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
strode
towards
the
door
,
while
the
miserable
abbot
arose
,
and
marching
with
uncertain
steps
to
a
little
oratory
adjoining
,
which
he
himself
had
built
,
knelt
down
before
the
altar
,
and
strove
to
pray
.

CHAPTER
III.--WHALLEY
ABBEY
.
  
<EOS>
A
sad
,
sad
change
hath
come
over
the
fair
Abbey
of
Whalley
.
<EOS>
It
knoweth
its
old
masters
no
longer
.
<EOS>
For
upwards
of
two
centuries
and
a
half
hath
<EOS>
the
"
Blessed
Place"[2
]
grown
in
beauty
and
riches
.
<EOS>
Seventeen
abbots
have
exercised
unbounded
hospitality
within
it
,
but
now
they
are
all
gone
,
save
one!--and
<EOS>
he
is
attainted
of
felony
and
treason
.
<EOS>
The
grave
monk
walketh
no
more
in
the
cloisters
,
nor
seeketh
his
pallet
in
the
dormitory
.
<EOS>
Vesper
or
matin
-
song
resound
not
as
of
old
within
the
fine
conventual
church
.
<EOS>
Stripped
are
the
altars
of
their
silver
crosses
,
and
the
shrines
of
their
votive
offerings
and
saintly
relics
.
<EOS>
Pyx
and
chalice
,
thuribule
and
vial
,
golden
-
headed
pastoral
staff
,
and
mitre
embossed
with
pearls
,
candlestick
and
Christmas
ship
of
silver
;
salver
,
basin
,
and
ewer
--
<EOS>
all
are
gone
--
the
splendid
sacristy
hath
been
despoiled
.
 
<EOS>
A
sad
,
sad
change
hath
come
over
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
The
libraries
,
well
stored
with
reverend
tomes
,
have
been
pillaged
,
and
their
contents
cast
to
the
flames
;
and
thus
long
laboured
manuscript
,
the
fruit
of
years
of
patient
industry
,
with
gloriously
illuminated
missal
,
are
irrecoverably
lost
.
<EOS>
The
large
infirmary
no
longer
receiveth
the
sick
;
in
the
locutory
sitteth
no
more
the
guest
.
<EOS>
No
longer
in
the
mighty
kitchens
are
prepared
the
prodigious
supply
of
meats
destined
for
the
support
of
the
poor
or
the
entertainment
of
the
traveller
.
<EOS>
No
kindly
porter
stands
at
the
gate
,
to
bid
the
stranger
enter
and
partake
of
the
munificent
abbot
's
hospitality
,
but
a
churlish
guard
bids
him
hie
away
,
and
menaces
him
if
he
tarries
with
his
halbert
.
<EOS>
Closed
are
the
buttery
-
hatches
and
the
pantries
;
and
the
daily
dole
of
bread
hath
ceased
.
<EOS>
Closed
,
also
,
to
the
brethren
is
the
refectory
.
<EOS>
The
cellarer
's
office
is
ended
.
<EOS>
The
strong
ale
which
he
brewed
in
October
,
is
tapped
in
March
by
roystering
troopers
.
<EOS>
The
rich
muscadel
and
malmsey
,
and
the
wines
of
Gascoigne
and
the
Rhine
,
are
no
longer
quaffed
by
the
abbot
and
his
more
honoured
guests
,
but
drunk
to
his
destruction
by
his
foes
.
<EOS>
The
great
gallery
,
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
,
the
pride
of
the
abbot
's
lodging
,
and
a
model
of
architecture
,
is
filled
not
with
white
-
robed
ecclesiastics
,
but
with
an
armed
earl
and
his
retainers
.
<EOS>
Neglected
is
the
little
oratory
dedicated
to
Our
Lady
of
Whalley
,
where
night
and
morn
the
abbot
used
to
pray
.
<EOS>
All
the
old
religious
and
hospitable
uses
of
the
abbey
are
foregone
.
<EOS>
The
reverend
stillness
of
the
cloisters
,
scarce
broken
by
the
quiet
tread
of
the
monks
,
is
now
disturbed
by
armed
heel
and
clank
of
sword
;
while
in
its
saintly
courts
are
heard
the
ribald
song
,
the
profane
jest
,
and
the
angry
brawl
.
<EOS>
Of
the
brethren
,
only
those
tenanting
the
cemetery
are
left
.
<EOS>
All
else
are
gone
,
driven
forth
,
as
vagabonds
,
with
stripes
and
curses
,
to
seek
refuge
where
they
may
.
 
<EOS>
A
sad
,
sad
change
has
come
over
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
In
the
plenitude
of
its
pride
and
power
has
it
been
cast
down
,
desecrated
,
despoiled
.
<EOS>
Its
treasures
are
carried
off
,
its
ornaments
sold
,
its
granaries
emptied
,
its
possessions
wasted
,
its
storehouses
sacked
,
its
cattle
slaughtered
and
sold
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
stripped
of
its
wealth
and
splendour
;
though
deprived
of
all
the
religious
graces
that
,
like
rich
incense
,
lent
an
odour
to
the
fane
,
its
external
beauty
is
yet
unimpaired
,
and
its
vast
proportions
undiminished
.
 
<EOS>
A
stately
pile
was
Whalley
--
one
of
the
loveliest
as
well
as
the
largest
in
the
realm
.
<EOS>
Carefully
had
it
been
preserved
by
its
reverend
rulers
,
and
where
reparations
or
additions
were
needed
they
were
judiciously
made
.
<EOS>
Thus
age
had
lent
it
beauty
,
by
mellowing
its
freshness
and
toning
its
hues
,
while
no
decay
was
perceptible
.
<EOS>
Without
a
struggle
had
it
yielded
to
the
captor
,
so
that
no
part
of
its
wide
belt
of
walls
or
towers
,
though
so
strongly
constructed
as
to
have
offered
effectual
resistance
,
were
injured
.
 
<EOS>
Never
had
Whalley
Abbey
looked
more
beautiful
than
on
a
bright
clear
morning
in
March
,
when
this
sad
change
had
been
wrought
,
and
when
,
from
a
peaceful
monastic
establishment
,
it
had
been
converted
into
a
menacing
fortress
.
<EOS>
The
sunlight
sparkled
upon
its
grey
walls
,
and
filled
its
three
great
quadrangular
courts
with
light
and
life
,
piercing
the
exquisite
carving
of
its
cloisters
,
and
revealing
all
the
intricate
beauty
and
combinations
of
the
arches
.
<EOS>
Stains
of
painted
glass
fell
upon
the
floor
of
the
magnificent
conventual
church
,
and
dyed
with
rainbow
hues
the
marble
tombs
of
the
Lacies
,
the
founders
of
the
establishment
,
brought
thither
when
the
monastery
was
removed
from
Stanlaw
in
Cheshire
,
and
upon
the
brass
-
covered
gravestones
of
the
abbots
in
the
presbytery
.
<EOS>
There
lay
Gregory
de
Northbury
,
eighth
abbot
of
Stanlaw
and
first
of
Whalley
,
and
William
Rede
,
the
last
abbot
;
but
there
was
never
to
lie
John
Paslew
.
<EOS>
The
slumber
of
the
ancient
prelates
was
soon
to
be
disturbed
,
and
the
sacred
structure
within
which
they
had
so
often
worshipped
,
up
-
reared
by
sacrilegious
hands
.
<EOS>
But
all
was
bright
and
beauteous
now
,
and
if
no
solemn
strains
were
heard
in
the
holy
pile
,
its
stillness
was
scarcely
less
reverential
and
awe
-
inspiring
.
<EOS>
The
old
abbey
wreathed
itself
in
all
its
attractions
,
as
if
to
welcome
back
its
former
ruler
,
whereas
it
was
only
to
receive
him
as
a
captive
doomed
to
a
felon
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
outward
show
.
<EOS>
Within
all
was
terrible
preparation
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
discontented
state
of
the
country
,
that
fearing
some
new
revolt
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
had
taken
measures
for
the
defence
of
the
abbey
,
and
along
the
wide
-
circling
walls
of
the
close
were
placed
ordnance
and
men
,
and
within
the
grange
stores
of
ammunition
.
<EOS>
A
strong
guard
was
set
at
each
of
the
gates
,
and
the
courts
were
filled
with
troops
.
<EOS>
The
bray
of
the
trumpet
echoed
within
the
close
,
where
rounds
were
set
for
the
archers
,
and
martial
music
resounded
within
the
area
of
the
cloisters
.
<EOS>
Over
the
great
north
-
eastern
gateway
,
which
formed
the
chief
entrance
to
the
abbot
's
lodging
,
floated
the
royal
banner
.
<EOS>
Despite
these
warlike
proceedings
the
fair
abbey
smiled
beneath
the
sun
,
in
all
,
or
more
than
all
,
its
pristine
beauty
,
its
green
hills
sloping
gently
down
towards
it
,
and
the
clear
and
sparkling
Calder
dashing
merrily
over
the
stones
at
its
base
.
 
<EOS>
But
upon
the
bridge
,
and
by
the
river
side
,
and
within
the
little
village
,
many
persons
were
assembled
,
conversing
gravely
and
anxiously
together
,
and
looking
out
towards
the
hills
,
where
other
groups
were
gathered
,
as
if
in
expectation
of
some
afflicting
event
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
were
herdsmen
and
farming
men
,
but
some
among
them
were
poor
monks
in
the
white
habits
of
the
Cistertian
brotherhood
,
but
which
were
now
stained
and
threadbare
,
while
their
countenances
bore
traces
of
severest
privation
and
suffering
.
<EOS>
All
the
herdsmen
and
farmers
had
been
retainers
of
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
The
poor
monks
looked
wistfully
at
their
former
habitation
,
but
replied
not
except
by
a
gentle
bowing
of
the
head
to
the
cruel
scoffs
and
taunts
with
which
they
were
greeted
by
the
passing
soldiers
;
but
the
sturdy
rustics
did
not
bear
these
outrages
so
tamely
,
and
more
than
one
brawl
ensued
,
in
which
blood
flowed
,
while
a
ruffianly
arquebussier
would
have
been
drowned
in
the
Calder
but
for
the
exertions
to
save
him
of
a
monk
whom
he
had
attacked
.
 
<EOS>
This
took
place
on
the
eleventh
of
March
,
1537
-
-more
than
three
months
after
the
date
of
the
watching
by
the
beacon
before
recorded
--
and
<EOS>
the
event
anticipated
by
the
concourse
without
the
abbey
,
as
well
as
by
those
within
its
walls
,
was
the
arrival
of
Abbot
Paslew
and
Fathers
Eastgate
and
Haydocke
,
who
were
to
be
brought
on
that
day
from
Lancaster
,
and
executed
on
the
following
morning
before
the
abbey
,
according
to
sentence
passed
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
gloomiest
object
in
the
picture
remains
to
be
described
,
but
yet
it
is
necessary
to
its
completion
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
gallows
of
unusual
form
and
height
,
erected
on
the
summit
of
a
gentle
hill
,
rising
immediately
in
front
of
the
abbot
's
lodgings
,
called
the
Holehouses
,
whose
rounded
,
bosomy
beauty
it
completely
destroyed
.
<EOS>
This
terrible
apparatus
of
condign
punishment
was
regarded
with
abhorrence
by
the
rustics
,
and
it
required
a
strong
guard
to
be
kept
constantly
round
it
to
preserve
it
from
demolition
.
 
<EOS>
Amongst
a
group
of
rustics
collected
on
the
road
leading
to
the
north
-
east
gateway
,
was
Cuthbert
Ashbead
,
who
having
been
deprived
of
his
forester
's
office
,
was
now
habited
in
a
frieze
doublet
and
hose
with
a
short
camlet
cloak
on
his
shoulder
,
and
a
fox
-
skin
cap
,
embellished
with
the
grinning
jaws
of
the
beast
on
his
head
.

wonder
on

and

issue

,
were
checked
by
the
approach
of
a
monk

who
,
joining

assemblage

called
their
attention
to
a
priestly
train
slowly
advancing
along
the
road

And
as
the
priestly
train
slowly
approached
,
with
heads
bowed
down
,
and
looks
fixed
sadly
upon
the
ground
,
the
rustic
assemblage
fell
upon
their
knees
,
and
implored
their
benediction
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
in
the
procession
passed
on
in
silence
,
but
the
prior
stopped
,
and
extending
his
hands
over
the
kneeling
group
,
cried
in
a
solemn
voice
,
 
"
Heaven
bless

<EOS>
"
Nay

I
command
you
to
desist
from
the
attempt
,
if
any
such
you
meditate

"
rejoined
the
prior
;
"
it
will
avail
nothing
,
and
you
will
only
sacrifice
your
own
lives

<EOS>
Our
enemies
are
too
strong

<EOS>
The
abbot
himself
would
give
you
like
counsel

"
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
the
words
uttered
than
from
the
great
gate
of
the
abbey
there
issued
a
dozen
arquebussiers
with
an
officer
at
their
head
,
who
marched
directly
towards
the
kneeling
hinds
,
evidently
with
the
intention
of
dispersing
them
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
strode
Nicholas
Demdike
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
alarmed
rustics
were
on
their
feet
,
and
Ruchot
o
'
<EOS>
Roaph
's
,
and
some
few
among
them
,
took
to
their
heels
,
but
Ashbead
,
Hal
o
<EOS>
'
Nabs
,
with
half
a
dozen
others
,
stood
their
ground
manfully
.
<EOS>
The
monks
remained
in
the
hope
of
preventing
any
violence
.
<EOS>
Presently
the
halberdiers
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
ringleader
,
"
cried
the
officer
,
who
proved
to
be
Richard
Assheton
,
pointing
out
Ashbead
;
"
seize
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Naw
mon
shall
lay
honts
o
'
meh
,
"
cried
Cuthbert
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
guard
pushed
past
the
monks
to
execute
their
leader
's
order
,
he
sprang
forward
,
and
,
wresting
a
halbert
from
the
foremost
of
them
,
stood
upon
his
defence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Seize
him
,
I
say
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Assheton
,
irritated
at
the
resistance
offered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
off
,
"
cried
Ashbead
;
"
yo'd
best
.
<EOS>
Loike
a
stag
at
bey
ey'm
dawngerous
.
<EOS>
Waar
horns
!
<EOS>
waar
horns
!
<EOS>
ey
sey
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
arquebussiers
looked
irresolute
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
Ashbead
would
only
be
taken
with
life
,
and
they
were
not
sure
that
it
was
their
leader
's
purpose
to
destroy
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
down
thy
weapon
,
Cuthbert
,
"
interposed
the
prior
;
"
it
will
avail
thee
nothing
against
odds
like
these
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mey
be
,
'
oly
prior
,
"
rejoined
Ashbead
,
flourishing
the
pike
:
"
<EOS>
boh
ey'st
ony
yield
wi
'
loife
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
disarm
him
,
"
cried
Demdike
,
stepping
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Theaw
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Ashbead
,
with
a
scornful
laugh
,
"
Cum
on
,
then
.
<EOS>
Hadsta
aw
t
'
fiends
<EOS>
i
'
hell
at
te
<EOS>
back
,
ey
shouldna
fear

.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yield
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Demdike
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
and
fixing
a
terrible
glance
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cum
on
,
wizard
,
"
rejoined
Ashbead
undauntedly
.
<EOS>
But
,
observing
that
his
opponent
was
wholly
unarmed
,
he
gave
the
pike
to
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
who
was
close
beside
him
,
observing
,
"
It
shall
never
be
said
that
Cuthbert
Ashbead
feawt
t
'
dule
himsel
unfairly
.
<EOS>
Nah
,
touch
me
if
theaw
dar'st
.
"
 
<EOS>
Demdike
required
no
further
provocation
.
<EOS>
With
almost
supernatural
force
and
quickness
he
sprung
upon
the
forester
,
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
.
<EOS>
But
the
active
young
man
freed
himself
from
the
gripe
,
and
closed
with
his
assailant
.
<EOS>
But
though
of
Herculean
build
,
it
soon
became
evident
that
Ashbead
would
have
the
worst
of
it
;
when
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
who
had
watched
the
struggle
with
intense
interest
,
could
not
help
coming
to
his
friend
's
assistance
,
and
made
a
push
at
Demdike
with
the
halbert
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
the
wrestlers
shifted
their
position
,
or
that
the
wizard
was
indeed
aided
by
the
powers
of
darkness
?
<EOS>
None
could
tell
,
but
so
it
was
that
the
pike
pierced
the
side
of
Ashbead
,
who
instantly
fell
to
the
ground
,
with
his
adversary
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
next
instant
his
hold
relaxed
,
and
the
wizard
sprang
to
his
feet
unharmed
,
but
deluged
in
blood
.
<EOS>
Hal
o
'
<EOS>
Nabs
uttered
a
cry
of
keenest
anguish
,
and
,
flinging
himself
upon
the
body
of
the
forester
,
tried
to
staunch
the
wound
;
but
he
was
quickly
seized
by
the
arquebussiers
,
and
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
with
a
thong
,
while
Ashbead
was
lifted
up
and
borne
towards
the
abbey
,
the
monks
and
rustics
following
slowly
after
;
but
the
latter
were
not
permitted
to
enter
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
unfortunate
keeper
,
who
by
this
time
had
become
insensible
from
loss
of
blood
,
was
carried
along
the
walled
enclosure
leading
to
the
abbot
's
lodging
,
a
female
with
a
child
in
her
arms
was
seen
advancing
from
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
She
was
tall
,
finely
formed
,
with
features
of
remarkable
beauty
,
though
of
a
masculine
and
somewhat
savage
character
,
and
with
magnificent
but
fierce
black
eyes
.
<EOS>
Her
skin
was
dark
,
and
her
hair
raven
black
,
contrasting
strongly
with
the
red
band
wound
around
it
.
<EOS>
Her
kirtle
was
of
murrey
-
coloured
serge
;
simply
,
but
becomingly
fashioned
.
<EOS>
A
glance
sufficed
to
show
her
how
matters
stood
with
poor
Ashbead
,
and
,
uttering
a
sharp
angry
cry
,
she
rushed
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
fixing
a
keen
reproachful
look
on
Demdike
,
who
walked
beside
the
wounded
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Demdike
with
a
bitter
laugh
;
"
the
fool
has
been
hurt
with
a
pike
.
<EOS>
Stand
out
of
the
way
,
Bess
,
and
let
the
men
pass
.
<EOS>
They
are
about
to
carry
him
to
the
cell
under
the
chapter
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
take
him
there
,
"
cried
Bess
Demdike
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
may
recover
if
his
wound
be
dressed
.
<EOS>
Let
him
go
to
the
infirmary
--
ha
,
I
forgot
--
there
is
no
one
there
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Father
Bancroft
is
at
the
gate
,
"
observed
one
of
the
arquebussiers
;
"
he
used
to
act
as
chirurgeon
in
the
abbey
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
monk
must
enter
the
gate
except
the
prisoners
when
they
arrive
,
"
observed
Assheton
;
"
such
are
the
positive
orders
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
needed
,
"
observed
Demdike
,
"
no
human
aid
can
save
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
can
other
aid
save
him
?
<EOS>
"
said
Bess
,
breathing
the
words
in
her
husband
's
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
to
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Demdike
,
pushing
her
roughly
aside
;
"
wouldst
have
me
save
thy
lover
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
,
"
said
Bess
,
in
a
deep
whisper
;
"
if
thou
save
him
not
,
by
the
devil
thou
servest
!
<EOS>
thou
shalt
lose
me
and
thy
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
Demdike
did
not
think
proper
to
contest
the
point
,
but
,
approaching
Assheton
,
requested
that
the
wounded
man
might
be
conveyed
to
an
arched
recess
,
which
he
pointed
out
.
<EOS>
Assent
being
given
,
Ashbead
was
taken
there
,
and
placed
upon
the
ground
,
after
which
the
arquebussiers
and
their
leader
marched
off
;
while
Bess
,
kneeling
down
,
supported
the
head
of
the
wounded
man
upon
her
knee
,
and
Demdike
,
taking
a
small
phial
from
his
doublet
,
poured
some
of
its
contents
clown
his
throat
.
<EOS>
The
wizard
then
took
a
fold
of
linen
,
with
which
he
was
likewise
provided
,
and
,
dipping
it
in
the
elixir
,
applied
it
to
the
wound
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
Ashbead
opened
his
eyes
,
and
looking
round
wildly
,
fixed
his
gaze
upon
Bess
,
who
placed
her
finger
upon
her
lips
to
enjoin
silence
,
but
he
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
understand
the
sign
.
 
<EOS>
"

he
groaned
;

exclaimed
Bess
,
"
Nicholas

"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh

replied
the
wounded
man
,
looking
round
;
"

<EOS>
Ey'st

<EOS>
Ah

Bess
.
<EOS>
"
You

"
 
<EOS>
"
Listen

continued
Ashbead
,
earnestly
;

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And

as

"
rejoined
Bess
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
,
Cuthbert
;
I
have
tried
them
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
knelt
to
them

implored
them
,
but
their
hearts
are
hard
as
flints

<EOS>
They
will
not

<EOS>
They
will
not
disobey
the
abbot
's
cruel
injunctions
,
though
he

their
superior
no

<EOS>
But
I

"
 
<EOS>
"
Leave

<EOS>
"
Thou

cried
Bess
;
"
Nicholas

"
 
<EOS>
"
He

<EOS>
cried
Ashbead
,
raising
.
<EOS>
"
Ey'st

.
"
 
<EOS>
And
before
he
could
be
prevented
he
tore
off
the
bandage
,
and
the
blood
burst
forth
anew
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
my
fault
if
he
perishes
now
,
"
observed
Demdike
,
moodily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help

"
<EOS>
implored
Bess
.
 
<EOS>
"
He

cried
Ashbead
,
struggling
and
increasing
the
effusion
.
<EOS>
"
Keep

<EOS>
Farewell
,
Bess
,
"
he
added
,
sinking
back
utterly
exhausted
by
the
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cuthbert
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Bess
,
terrified
by
his
looks
,
"
Cuthbert
!
<EOS>
art

<EOS>
Look
at

,
speak

<EOS>
Ha

"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
as
if
seized
by
a
sudden
idea
,
"
they
say
the
blessing
of
a
dying
man
will
avail
.
<EOS>
Bless
my
child
,
Cuthbert
,
bless
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
it
me
!
"
groaned
the
forester
.
 
<EOS>
Bess
held
the
infant
towards
him
;
but
before
he
could
place
his
hands
upon
it
all
power
forsook
him
,
and
he
fell
back
and
expired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lost

<EOS>
lost
!
<EOS>
for
ever

!
"
cried
Bess
,
with
a
wild
shriek
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
loud
blast
was
blown
from
the
gate
-
tower
,
and
a
trumpeter
called
out
,
 
<EOS>
"
The
abbot

the
two

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To

"
<EOS>
cried
Demdike
,
imperiously
,
and
seizing
the
bewildered
woman
by
the
arm
;
"
to
thy
feet
,
and
come
with
me
to
meet
him
!

CHAPTER
IV.--THE
MALEDICTION
.
  
<EOS>
The
captive
ecclesiastics
,
together
with
the
strong
escort
by
which
they
were
attended
,
under
the
command
of
John
Braddyll
,
the
high
sheriff
of
the
county
,
had
passed
the
previous
night
at
Whitewell
,
in
Bowland
Forest
;
and
the
abbot
,
before
setting
out
on
his
final
journey
,
was
permitted
to
spend
an
hour
in
prayer
in
a
little
chapel
on
an
adjoining
hill
,
overlooking
a
most
picturesque
portion
of
the
forest
,
the
beauties
of
which
were
enhanced
by
the
windings
of
the
Hodder
,
one
of
the
loveliest
streams
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
His
devotions
performed
,
Paslew
,
attended
by
a
guard
,
slowly
descended
the
hill
,
and
gazed
his
last
on
scenes
familiar
to
him
almost
from
infancy
.
<EOS>
Noble
trees
,
which
now
looked
like
old
friends
,
to
whom
he
was
bidding
an
eternal
adieu
,
stood
around
him
.
<EOS>
Beneath
them
,
at
the
end
of
a
glade
,
couched
a
herd
of
deer
,
which
started
off
at
sight
of
the
intruders
,
and
made
him
envy
their
freedom
and
fleetness
as
he
followed
them
in
thought
to
their
solitudes
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
a
steep
rock
ran
the
Hodder
,
making
the
pleasant
music
of
other
days
as
it
dashed
over
its
pebbly
bed
,
and
recalling
times
,
when
,
free
from
all
care
,
he
had
strayed
by
its
wood
-
fringed
banks
,
to
listen
to
the
pleasant
sound
of
running
waters
,
and
watch
the
shining
pebbles
beneath
them
,
and
the
swift
trout
and
dainty
umber
glancing
past
.
 
<EOS>
A
bitter
pang
was
it
to
part
with
scenes
so
fair
,
and
the
abbot
spoke
no
word
,
nor
even
looked
up
,
until
,
passing
Little
Mitton
,
he
came
in
sight
of
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Then
,
collecting
all
his
energies
,
he
prepared
for
the
shock
he
was
about
to
endure
.
<EOS>
But
nerved
as
he
was
,
his
firmness
was
sorely
tried
when
he
beheld
the
stately
pile
,
once
his
own
,
now
gone
from
him
and
his
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
gave
one
fond
glance
towards
it
,
and
then
painfully
averting
his
gaze
,
recited
,
in
a
low
voice
,
this
supplication:--
     
"
_
Miserere
mei
,
Deus
,
<EOS>
secundum
magnam
misericordiam
tuam
.
<EOS>
Et
    
secundum
multitudinem
miserationum
tuarum
,
dele
iniquitatem
    
meam
.
<EOS>
Amplius
lava
<EOS>
me
ab
iniquitate
meâ
<EOS>
,
et
à
peccato
meo
    
munda
me
.
<EOS>
_
"
 
<EOS>
But
other
thoughts
and
other
emotions
crowded
upon
him
,
when
he
beheld
the
groups
of
his
old
retainers
advancing
to
meet
him
:
men
,
women
,
and
children
pouring
forth
loud
lamentations
,
prostrating
themselves
at
his
feet
,
and
deploring
his
doom
.
<EOS>
The
abbot
's
fortitude
had
a
severe
trial
here
,
and
the
tears
sprung
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
devotion
of
these
poor
people
touched
him
more
sharply
than
the
severity
of
his
adversaries
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
ye
!
<EOS>
bless
ye
!
<EOS>
my
children
,
"
he
cried
;
"
repine
not
for
me
,
for
I
bear
my
cross
with
resignation
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
me
to
bewail
your
lot
,
much
fearing
that
the
flock
I
have
so
long
and
so
zealously
tended
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
other
and
less
heedful
pastors
,
or
,
still
worse
,
of
devouring
wolves
.
<EOS>
Bless
ye
,
my
children
,
and
be
comforted
.
<EOS>
Think
of
the
end
of
Abbot
Paslew
,
and
for
what
he
suffered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Think
that
he
was
a
traitor
to
the
king
,
and
took
up
arms
in
rebellion
against
him
,
"
cried
the
sheriff
,
riding
up
,
and
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
;
"
and
that
for
his
heinous
offences
he
was
justly
condemned
to
death
.
"
 
<EOS>
Murmurs
arose
at
this
speech
,
but
they
were
instantly
checked
by
the
escort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Think
charitably
of
me
,
my
children
,
"
said
the
abbot
;
"
and
the
blessed
Virgin
keep
you
steadfast
in
your
faith
.
<EOS>
Benedicite
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
silent
,
traitor
,
I
command
thee
,
"
cried
the
sheriff
,
striking
him
with
his
gauntlet
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
's
pale
check
burnt
crimson
,
and
his
eye
flashed
fire
,
but
he
controlled
himself
,
and
answered
meekly,--
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
didst
not
speak
in
such
wise
,
John
Braddyll
,
when
I
saved
thee
from
the
flood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Which
flood
thou
thyself
caused
to
burst
forth
by
devilish
arts
,
"
rejoined
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"
I
owe
thee
little
for
the
service
.
<EOS>
If
for
naught
else
,
thou
deservest
death
for
thy
evil
doings
on
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
made
no
reply
,
for
Braddyll
's
allusion
conjured
up
a
sombre
train
of
thought
within
his
breast
,
awakening
apprehensions
which
he
could
neither
account
for
,
nor
shake
off
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
cavalcade
slowly
approached
the
north
-
east
gateway
of
the
abbey
--
passing
through
crowds
of
kneeling
and
sorrowing
bystanders;--but
so
deeply
was
the
abbot
engrossed
by
the
one
dread
idea
that
possessed
him
,
that
he
saw
them
not
,
and
scarce
heard
their
woful
lamentations
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
the
cavalcade
stopped
,
and
the
sheriff
rode
on
to
the
gate
,
in
the
opening
of
which
some
ceremony
was
observed
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
Paslew
raised
his
eyes
,
and
beheld
standing
before
him
a
tall
man
,
with
a
woman
beside
him
bearing
an
infant
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
pair
were
fixed
upon
him
with
vindictive
exultation
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
averted
his
gaze
,
but
an
irresistible
fascination
withheld
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
seest
all
is
prepared
,
"
said
Demdike
,
coming
close
up
the
mule
on
which
Paslew
was
mounted
,
and
pointing
to
the
gigantic
gallows
,
looming
above
the
abbey
walls
;
"
wilt
them
now
accede
to
my
request
?
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
added
,
significantly--"on
the
same
terms
as
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
understood
his
meaning
well
.
<EOS>
Life
and
freedom
were
offered
him
by
a
being
,
whose
power
to
accomplish
his
promise
he
did
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
was
hard
;
but
he
resisted
the
temptation
,
and
answered
firmly,--
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
die
the
felon
death
thou
meritest
,
"
cried
Bess
,
fiercely
;
"
and
I
will
glut
mine
eyes
with
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Incensed
beyond
endurance
,
the
abbot
looked
sternly
at
her
,
and
raised
his
hand
in
denunciation
.
<EOS>
The
action
and
the
look
were
so
appalling
,
that
the
affrighted
woman
would
have
fled
if
her
husband
had
not
restrained
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
holy
patriarchs
and
prophets
;
by
the
prelates
and
confessors
;
by
the
doctors
of
the
church
;
by
the
holy
abbots
,
monks
,
and
eremites
,
who
dwelt
in
solitudes
,
in
mountains
,
and
in
caverns
;
by
the
holy
saints
and
martyrs
,
who
suffered
torture
and
death
for
their
faith
,
I
curse
thee
,
witch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Paslew
.
<EOS>
"
May
the
malediction
of
Heaven
and
all
its
hosts
alight
on
the
head
of
thy
<EOS>
infant--
"
 
"
Oh
!
holy
abbot
,
"
shrieked
Bess
,
breaking
from
her
husband
,
and
flinging
herself
at
Paslew
's
feet
,
"
curse
me
,
if
thou
wilt
,
but
spare
my
innocent
child
.
<EOS>
Save
it
,
and
we
will
save
thee
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Avoid
thee
,
wretched
and
impious
woman
,
"
rejoined
the
abbot
;
"
I
have
pronounced
the
dread
anathema
,
and
it
can
not
be
recalled
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
dripping
garments
of
thy
child
.
<EOS>
In
blood
has
it
been
baptised
,
and
through
blood
-
stained
paths
shall
its
course
be
taken
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
shrieked
Bess
,
noticing
for
the
first
time
the
ensanguined
condition
of
the
infant
's
attire
.
"
<EOS>
Cuthbert
's
blood
--
<EOS>
oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
wicked
woman
,
"
pursued
the
abbot
,
as
if
filled
with
a
prophetic
spirit
.
"
<EOS>
Thy
child
's
life
shall
be
long
--
beyond
the
ordinary
term
of
woman
--
but
it
shall
be
a
life
of
woe
and
ill
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
stay
him
--
stay
him
;
or
I
shall
die
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bess
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
wizard
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
A
greater
power
than
his
own
apparently
overmastered
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Children
shall
she
have
,
"
continued
the
abbot
,
"
and
children
's
children
,
but
they
shall
be
a
race
doomed
and
accursed
--
a
brood
of
adders
,
that
the
world
shall
flee
from
and
crush
.
<EOS>
A
thing
accursed
,
and
shunned
by
her
fellows
,
shall
thy
daughter
be
--
evil
reputed
and
evil
doing
.
<EOS>
No
hand
to
help
her
--
no
lip
to
bless
her
--
life
a
burden
;
and
death
--
long
,
long
in
coming
--
finding
her
in
a
dismal
dungeon
.
<EOS>
Now
,
depart
from
me
,
and
trouble
me
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
Bess
made
a
motion
as
if
she
would
go
,
and
then
turning
,
partly
round
,
dropped
heavily
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Demdike
caught
the
child
ere
<EOS>
she
fell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
hast
killed
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
to
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
stronger
voice
than
mine
hath
spoken
,
if
it
be
so
,
"
rejoined
Paslew
.
"
<EOS>
_
Fuge
miserrime
,
fuge
malefice
,
quia
judex
adest
iratus
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
trumpet
again
sounded
,
and
the
cavalcade
being
put
in
motion
,
the
abbot
and
his
fellow
-
captives
passed
through
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
Dismounting
from
their
mules
within
the
court
,
before
the
chapter
-
house
,
the
captive
ecclesiastics
,
preceded
by
the
sheriff
were
led
to
the
principal
chamber
of
the
structure
,
where
the
Earl
of
Derby
awaited
them
,
seated
in
the
Gothic
carved
oak
chair
,
formerly
occupied
by
the
Abbots
of
Whalley
on
the
occasions
of
conferences
or
elections
.
<EOS>
The
earl
was
surrounded
by
his
officers
,
and
the
chamber
was
filled
with
armed
men
.
<EOS>
The
abbot
slowly
advanced
towards
the
earl
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
was
dignified
and
firm
,
even
majestic
.
<EOS>
The
exaltation
of
spirit
,
occasioned
by
the
interview
with
Demdike
and
his
wife
,
had
passed
away
,
and
was
succeeded
by
a
profound
calm
.
<EOS>
The
hue
of
his
cheek
was
livid
,
but
otherwise
he
seemed
wholly
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
The
ceremony
of
delivering
up
the
bodies
of
the
prisoners
to
the
earl
was
gone
through
by
the
sheriff
,
and
their
sentences
were
then
read
aloud
by
a
clerk
.
<EOS>
After
this
the
earl
,
who
had
hitherto
remained
covered
,
took
off
his
cap
,
and
in
a
solemn
voice
spoke:--
 
"
John
Paslew
,
somewhile
Abbot
of
Whalley
,
but
now
an
attainted
and
condemned
felon
,
and
John
Eastgate
and
William
Haydocke
,
formerly
brethren
of
the
same
monastery
,
and
confederates
with
him
in
crime
,
ye
have
heard
your
doom
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
you
shall
die
the
ignominious
death
of
traitors
;
but
the
king
in
his
mercy
,
having
regard
not
so
much
to
the
heinous
nature
of
your
offences
towards
his
sovereign
majesty
as
to
the
sacred
offices
you
once
held
,
and
of
which
you
have
been
shamefully
deprived
,
is
graciously
pleased
to
remit
that
part
of
your
sentence
,
whereby
ye
are
condemned
to
be
quartered
alive
,
willing
that
the
hearts
which
conceived
so
much
malice
and
violence
against
him
should
cease
to
beat
within
your
own
bosoms
,
and
that
the
arms
which
were
raised
in
rebellion
against
him
should
be
interred
in
one
common
grave
with
the
trunks
to
which
they
belong
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
God
save
the
high
and
puissant
king
,
Henry
the
Eighth
,
and
free
him
from
all
traitors
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
humbly
thank
his
majesty
for
his
clemency
,
"
said
the
abbot
,
amid
the
profound
silence
that
ensued
;
"
and
I
pray
you
,
my
good
lord
,
when
you
shall
write
to
the
king
concerning
us
,
to
say
to
his
majesty
that
we
died
penitent
of
many
and
grave
offences
,
amongst
the
which
is
chiefly
that
of
having
taken
up
arms
unlawfully
against
him
,
but
that
we
did
so
solely
with
the
view
of
freeing
his
highness
from
evil
counsellors
,
and
of
re
-
establishing
our
holy
church
,
for
the
which
we
would
willingly
die
,
if
our
death
might
in
anywise
profit
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
exclaimed
Father
Eastgate
,
who
stood
with
his
hands
crossed
upon
his
breast
,
close
behind
Paslew
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
abbot
hath
uttered
my
sentiments
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
hath
not
uttered
mine
,
"
cried
Father
Haydocke
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
no
grace
from
the
bloody
Herodias
,
and
will
accept
none
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
done
I
would
do
again
,
were
the
past
to
return
--
<EOS>
nay
,
I
would
do
more
--
I
would
find
a
way
to
reach
the
tyrant
's
heart
,
and
thus
free
our
church
from
its
worst
enemy
,
and
the
land
from
a
ruthless
oppressor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Remove
him
,
"
said
the
earl
;
"
the
vile
traitor
shall
be
dealt
with
as
he
merits
.
<EOS>
For
you
,
"
he
added
,
as
the
order
was
obeyed
,
and
addressing
the
other
prisoners
,
"
and
especially
you
,
John
Paslew
,
who
have
shown
some
compunction
for
your
crimes
,
and
to
prove
to
you
that
the
king
is
not
the
ruthless
tyrant
<EOS>
he
hath
been
just
represented
<EOS>
,
I
hereby
in
his
name
promise
you
any
boon
,
which
you
may
ask
consistently
with
your
situation
.
<EOS>
What
favour
would
you
have
shown
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
reflected
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
thou
,
John
Eastgate
,
"
said
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
seeing
that
the
abbot
was
occupied
in
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
may
proffer
a
request
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
monk
,
"
it
is
that
our
poor
distraught
brother
,
William
Haydocke
,
be
spared
the
quartering
block
.
<EOS>
He
meant
not
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
be
it
as
thou
wilt
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
bending
his
brows
,
"
though
he
ill
deserves
such
grace
.
<EOS>
Now
,
John
Paslew
,
what
wouldst
thou
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
addressed
,
the
abbot
looked
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
made
the
same
request
as
my
brother
,
John
Eastgate
,
if
he
had
not
anticipated
me
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Paslew
;
"
<EOS>
but
since
his
petition
is
granted
,
I
would
,
on
my
own
part
,
entreat
that
mass
be
said
for
us
in
the
convent
church
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
brethren
are
without
the
abbey
,
and
,
if
permitted
,
will
assist
at
its
performance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
if
I
shall
not
incur
the
king
's
displeasure
in
assenting
,
"
replied
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
after
a
little
reflection
;
"
but
I
will
hazard
it
.
<EOS>
Mass
for
the
dead
shall
be
said
in
the
church
at
midnight
,
and
all
the
brethren
who
choose
to
come
thither
shall
be
permitted
to
assist
at
it
.
<EOS>
They
will
attend
,
I
doubt
not
,
for
it
will
be
the
last
time
the
rites
of
the
Romish
Church
will
be
performed
in
those
Walls
.
<EOS>
They
shall
have
all
required
for
the
ceremonial
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
's
blessings
on
you
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
first
pledge
me
your
sacred
word
,
"
said
the
earl
,
"
by
the
holy
office
you
once
held
,
and
by
the
saints
in
whom
you
trust
,
that
this
concession
shall
not
be
made
the
means
of
any
attempt
at
flight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
swear
it
,
"
replied
the
abbot
,
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
also
swear
it
,
"
added
Father
Eastgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
the
requisite
orders
.
<EOS>
Notice
of
the
celebration
of
mass
at
midnight
shall
be
proclaimed
without
the
abbey
.
<EOS>
Now
remove
the
prisoners
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
captive
ecclesiastics
were
led
forth
.
<EOS>
Father
Eastgate
was
taken
to
a
strong
room
in
the
lower
part
of
the
chapter
-
house
,
where
all
acts
of
discipline
had
been
performed
by
the
monks
,
and
where
the
knotted
lash
,
the
spiked
girdle
,
and
the
hair
shirt
had
once
hung
;
while
the
abbot
was
conveyed
to
his
old
chamber
,
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
reception
,
and
there
left
alone
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
V.--THE
MIDNIGHT
MASS
.
  
<EOS>
Dolefully
sounds
the
All
Souls
'
bell
from
the
tower
of
the
convent
church
.
<EOS>
The
bell
is
one
of
five
,
and
has
obtained
the
name
because
it
is
tolled
only
for
those
about
to
pass
away
from
life
.
<EOS>
Now
it
rings
the
knell
of
three
souls
to
depart
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Brightly
illumined
is
the
fane
,
within
which
no
taper
hath
gleamed
since
the
old
worship
ceased
,
showing
that
preparations
are
made
for
the
last
service
.
<EOS>
The
organ
,
dumb
so
long
,
breathes
a
low
prelude
.
<EOS>
Sad
is
it
to
hear
that
knell
--
sad
to
view
those
gloriously
-
dyed
panes
--
and
to
think
why
the
one
rings
and
the
other
is
lighted
up
.
 
<EOS>
Word
having
gone
forth
of
the
midnight
mass
,
all
the
ejected
brethren
flock
to
the
abbey
.
<EOS>
Some
have
toiled
through
miry
and
scarce
passable
roads
.
<EOS>
Others
have
come
down
from
the
hills
,
and
forded
deep
streams
at
the
hazard
of
life
,
rather
than
go
round
by
the
far
-
off
bridge
,
and
arrive
too
late
.
<EOS>
Others
,
who
conceive
themselves
in
peril
from
the
share
they
have
taken
in
the
late
insurrection
,
quit
their
secure
retreats
,
and
expose
themselves
to
capture
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
snare
laid
for
them
,
but
they
run
the
risk
.
<EOS>
Others
,
coming
from
a
yet
greater
distance
,
beholding
the
illuminated
church
from
afar
,
and
catching
the
sound
of
the
bell
tolling
at
intervals
,
hurry
on
,
and
reach
the
gate
breathless
and
wellnigh
exhausted
.
<EOS>
But
no
questions
are
asked
.
<EOS>
All
who
present
themselves
in
ecclesiastical
habits
are
permitted
to
enter
,
and
take
part
in
the
procession
forming
in
the
cloister
,
or
proceed
at
once
to
the
church
,
if
they
prefer
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dolefully
sounds
the
bell
.
<EOS>
Barefooted
brethren
meet
together
,
sorrowfully
salute
each
other
,
and
form
in
a
long
line
in
the
great
area
of
the
cloisters
.
<EOS>
At
their
head
are
six
monks
bearing
tall
lighted
candles
.
<EOS>
After
them
come
the
quiristers
,
and
then
one
carrying
the
Host
,
between
the
incense
-
bearers
.
<EOS>
Next
comes
a
youth
holding
the
bell
.
<EOS>
Next
are
placed
the
dignitaries
of
the
church
,
the
prior
ranking
first
,
and
the
others
standing
two
and
two
according
to
their
degrees
.
<EOS>
Near
the
entrance
of
the
refectory
,
which
occupies
the
whole
south
side
of
the
quadrangle
,
stand
a
band
of
halberdiers
,
whose
torches
cast
a
ruddy
glare
on
the
opposite
tower
and
buttresses
of
the
convent
church
,
revealing
the
statues
not
yet
plucked
from
their
niches
,
the
crosses
on
the
pinnacles
,
and
the
gilt
image
of
Saint
Gregory
de
Northbury
,
still
holding
its
place
over
the
porch
.
<EOS>
Another
band
are
stationed
near
the
mouth
of
the
vaulted
passage
,
under
the
chapter
-
house
and
vestry
,
whose
grey
,
irregular
walls
,
pierced
by
numberless
richly
ornamented
windows
,
and
surmounted
by
small
turrets
,
form
a
beautiful
boundary
on
the
right
;
while
a
third
party
are
planted
on
the
left
,
in
the
open
space
,
beneath
the
dormitory
,
the
torchlight
flashing
ruddily
upon
the
hoary
pillars
and
groined
arches
sustaining
the
vast
structure
above
them
.
 
<EOS>
Dolefully
sounds
the
bell
.
<EOS>
And
the
ghostly
procession
thrice
tracks
the
four
ambulatories
of
the
cloisters
,
solemnly
chanting
a
requiem
for
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Dolefully
sounds
the
bell
.
<EOS>
And
at
its
summons
all
the
old
retainers
of
the
abbot
press
to
the
gate
,
and
sue
for
admittance
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
They
,
therefore
,
mount
the
neighbouring
hill
commanding
the
abbey
,
and
as
the
solemn
sounds
float
faintly
by
,
and
glimpses
are
caught
of
the
white
-
robed
brethren
gliding
along
the
cloisters
,
and
rendered
phantom
-
like
by
the
torchlight
,
the
beholders
half
imagine
it
must
be
a
company
of
sprites
,
and
that
the
departed
monks
have
been
permitted
for
an
hour
to
assume
their
old
forms
,
and
revisit
their
old
haunts
.
 
<EOS>
Dolefully
sounds
the
bell
.
<EOS>
And
two
biers
,
covered
with
palls
,
are
borne
slowly
towards
the
church
,
followed
by
a
tall
monk
.
 
<EOS>
The
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
.
<EOS>
The
procession
having
drawn
up
within
the
court
in
front
of
the
abbot
's
lodging
,
the
prisoners
were
brought
forth
,
and
at
sight
of
the
abbot
the
whole
of
the
monks
fell
on
their
knees
.
<EOS>
A
touching
sight
was
it
to
see
those
reverend
men
prostrate
before
their
ancient
superior,--he
condemned
to
die
,
and
they
deprived
of
their
monastic
home,--and
<EOS>
the
officer
had
not
the
heart
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
Deeply
affected
,
Paslew
advanced
to
the
prior
,
and
raising
him
,
affectionately
embraced
him
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
addressed
some
words
of
comfort
to
the
others
,
who
arose
as
he
enjoined
them
,
and
at
a
signal
from
the
officer
,
the
procession
set
out
for
the
church
,
singing
the
"
_
Placebo
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
abbot
and
his
fellow
captives
brought
up
the
rear
,
with
a
guard
on
either
side
of
them
.
<EOS>
All
Souls
'
bell
tolled
dolefully
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
an
officer
entered
the
great
hall
,
where
the
Earl
of
Derby
was
feasting
with
his
retainers
,
and
informed
him
that
the
hour
appointed
for
the
ceremonial
was
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
The
earl
arose
and
went
to
the
church
attended
by
Braddyll
and
Assheton
.
<EOS>
He
entered
by
the
western
porch
,
and
,
proceeding
to
the
choir
,
seated
himself
in
the
magnificently
-
carved
stall
formerly
used
by
Paslew
,
and
placed
where
it
stood
,
a
hundred
years
before
,
by
John
Eccles
,
ninth
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
Midnight
struck
.
<EOS>
The
great
door
of
the
church
swung
open
,
and
the
organ
pealed
forth
the
"
_
De
profundis
_
.
<EOS>
"
The
aisles
were
filled
with
armed
men
,
but
a
clear
space
was
left
for
the
procession
,
which
presently
entered
in
the
same
order
as
before
,
and
moved
slowly
along
the
transept
.
<EOS>
Those
who
came
first
thought
it
a
dream
,
so
strange
was
it
to
find
themselves
once
again
in
the
old
accustomed
church
.
<EOS>
The
good
prior
melted
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
abbot
came
.
<EOS>
To
him
the
whole
scene
appeared
like
a
vision
.
<EOS>
The
lights
streaming
from
the
altar
--
the
incense
loading
the
air
--
the
deep
diapasons
rolling
overhead
--
the
well
-
known
faces
of
the
brethren
--
the
familiar
aspect
of
the
sacred
edifice
--
all
these
filled
him
with
emotions
too
painful
almost
for
endurance
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
time
he
should
visit
this
holy
place
--
the
last
time
he
should
hear
those
solemn
sounds
--
the
last
time
he
should
behold
those
familiar
objects
--
ay
,
the
last
!
<EOS>
Death
could
have
no
pang
like
this
!
<EOS>
And
with
heart
wellnigh
bursting
,
and
limbs
scarcely
serving
their
office
,
he
tottered
on
.
 
<EOS>
Another
trial
awaited
him
,
and
one
for
which
he
was
wholly
unprepared
.
<EOS>
As
he
drew
near
the
chancel
,
he
looked
down
an
opening
on
the
right
,
which
seemed
purposely
preserved
by
the
guard
.
<EOS>
Why
were
those
tapers
burning
in
the
side
chapel
?
<EOS>
What
was
within
it
?
<EOS>
He
looked
again
,
and
beheld
two
uncovered
biers
.
<EOS>
On
one
lay
the
body
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
started
.
<EOS>
In
the
beautiful
,
but
fierce
features
of
the
dead
,
he
beheld
the
witch
,
Bess
Demdike
.
<EOS>
She
was
gone
to
her
account
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
malediction
he
had
pronounced
upon
her
child
had
killed
her
.
 
<EOS>
Appalled
,
he
turned
to
the
other
bier
,
and
recognised
Cuthbert
Ashbead
.
<EOS>
He
shuddered
,
but
comforted
himself
that
he
was
at
least
guiltless
of
his
death
;
though
he
had
a
strange
feeling
that
the
poor
forester
had
in
some
way
perished
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
attention
was
diverted
towards
a
tall
monk
in
the
Cistertian
habit
,
standing
between
the
bodies
,
with
the
cowl
drawn
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
As
Paslew
gazed
at
him
,
the
monk
slowly
raised
his
hood
,
and
partially
disclosed
features
that
smote
the
abbot
as
if
he
had
beheld
a
spectre
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
?
<EOS>
Could
fancy
cheat
him
thus
?
<EOS>
He
looked
again
.
<EOS>
The
monk
was
still
standing
there
,
but
the
cowl
had
dropped
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
Striving
to
shake
off
the
horror
that
possessed
him
,
the
abbot
staggered
forward
,
and
reaching
the
presbytery
,
sank
upon
his
knees
.
 
<EOS>
The
ceremonial
then
commenced
.
<EOS>
The
solemn
requiem
was
sung
by
the
choir
;
and
three
yet
living
heard
the
hymn
for
the
repose
of
their
souls
.
<EOS>
Always
deeply
impressive
,
the
service
was
unusually
so
on
this
sad
occasion
,
and
the
melodious
voices
of
the
singers
never
sounded
so
mournfully
sweet
as
then
--
<EOS>
the
demeanour
of
the
prior
never
seemed
so
dignified
,
nor
his
accents
so
touching
and
solemn
.
<EOS>
The
sternest
hearts
were
softened
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
abbot
found
it
impossible
to
fix
his
attention
on
the
service
.
<EOS>
The
lights
at
the
altar
burnt
dimly
in
his
eyes
--
the
loud
antiphon
and
the
supplicatory
prayer
fell
upon
a
listless
ear
.
<EOS>
His
whole
life
was
passing
in
review
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
himself
as
he
was
when
he
first
professed
his
faith
,
and
felt
the
zeal
and
holy
aspirations
that
filled
him
then
.
<EOS>
Years
flew
by
at
a
glance
,
and
he
found
himself
sub
-
deacon
;
the
sub
-
deacon
became
deacon
;
and
the
deacon
,
sub
-
prior
,
and
the
end
of
his
ambition
seemed
plain
before
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
a
rival
;
his
fears
told
him
a
superior
in
zeal
and
learning
:
one
who
,
though
many
years
younger
than
he
,
had
risen
so
rapidly
in
favour
with
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
,
that
he
threatened
to
outstrip
him
,
even
now
,
when
the
goal
was
full
in
view
.
<EOS>
The
darkest
passage
of
his
life
approached
:
a
crime
which
should
cast
a
deep
shadow
over
the
whole
of
his
brilliant
after
-
career
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
shunned
its
contemplation
,
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
In
vain
.
<EOS>
It
stood
out
more
palpably
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
His
rival
was
no
longer
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
How
he
was
removed
the
abbot
did
not
dare
to
think
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
gone
for
ever
,
unless
the
tall
monk
were
he
!
 
<EOS>
Unable
to
endure
this
terrible
retrospect
,
Paslew
strove
to
bend
his
thoughts
on
other
things
.
<EOS>
The
choir
was
singing
the
"
_
Dies
Iræ
_
,
"
and
their
voices
thundered
forth:--
           
Rex
tremendæ
majestatis
,
          
<EOS>
Qui
salvandos
salvas
gratis
,
          
Salva
me
,
fons
pietatis
!
 
<EOS>
Fain
would
the
abbot
have
closed
his
ears
,
and
,
hoping
to
stifle
the
remorseful
pangs
that
seized
upon
his
very
vitals
with
the
sharpness
of
serpents
'
teeth
,
he
strove
to
dwell
upon
the
frequent
and
severe
acts
of
penance
he
had
performed
.
<EOS>
But
he
now
found
that
his
penitence
had
never
been
sincere
and
efficacious
.
<EOS>
This
one
damning
sin
obscured
all
his
good
actions
;
and
he
felt
if
he
died
unconfessed
,
and
with
the
weight
of
guilt
upon
his
soul
,
he
should
perish
everlastingly
.
<EOS>
Again
he
fled
from
the
torment
of
retrospection
,
and
again
heard
the
choir
thundering
forth--
           
<EOS>
Lacrymosa
dies
illa
,
          
<EOS>
Quâ
resurget
<EOS>
ex
favillâ
          
<EOS>
Judicandus
homo
reus
.
          
<EOS>
Huic
ergo
parce
,
Deus
!
          
<EOS>
Pie
Jesu
Domine
!
          
<EOS>
Dona
eis
requiem
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
exclaimed
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
And
bowing
his
head
to
the
ground
,
he
earnestly
repeated--
           
<EOS>
"
Pie
Jesu
Domine
!
          
<EOS>
Dona
eis
requiem
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
looked
up
,
and
resolved
to
ask
for
a
confessor
,
and
unburthen
his
soul
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
The
offertory
and
post
-
communion
were
over
;
the
"
_
requiescant
in
pace_"--awful
words
addressed
to
living
ears
--
were
pronounced
;
and
the
mass
was
ended
.
 
<EOS>
All
prepared
to
depart
.
<EOS>
The
prior
descended
from
the
altar
to
embrace
and
take
leave
of
the
abbot
;
and
at
the
same
time
the
Earl
of
Derby
came
from
the
stall
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
all
been
done
to
your
satisfaction
,
John
Paslew
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
earl
,
as
he
drew
near
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
,
my
good
lord
,
"
replied
the
abbot
,
lowly
inclining
his
head
;
"
and
I
pray
you
think
me
not
importunate
,
if
I
prefer
one
other
request
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
a
confessor
visit
me
,
that
I
may
lay
bare
my
inmost
heart
to
him
,
and
receive
absolution
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
anticipated
the
request
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
"
and
have
provided
a
priest
for
you
.
<EOS>
He
shall
attend
you
,
within
an
hour
,
in
your
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
ample
time
between
this
and
daybreak
,
to
settle
your
accounts
with
Heaven
,
should
they
be
ever
so
weighty
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
so
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Paslew
;
"
but
a
whole
life
is
scarcely
long
enough
for
repentance
,
much
less
a
few
short
hours
.
<EOS>
But
in
regard
to
the
confessor
,
"
he
continued
,
filled
with
misgiving
by
the
earl
's
manner
,
"
I
should
be
glad
to
be
shriven
by
Father
Christopher
Smith
,
late
prior
of
the
abbey
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
not
be
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
sternly
and
decidedly
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
all
you
can
require
in
him
I
shall
send
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
sighed
,
seeing
that
remonstrance
was
useless
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
further
question
I
would
address
to
you
,
my
lord
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
that
refers
to
the
place
of
my
interment
.
<EOS>
Beneath
our
feet
lie
buried
all
my
predecessors
--
Abbots
of
Whalley
.
<EOS>
Here
lies
John
Eccles
,
for
whom
was
carved
the
stall
in
which
your
lordship
hath
sat
,
and
from
which
I
have
been
dethroned
.
<EOS>
Here
rests
the
learned
John
Lyndelay
,
fifth
abbot
;
and
beside
him
his
immediate
predecessor
,
Robert
de
Topcliffe
,
<EOS>
who
,
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
ago
,
on
the
festival
of
Saint
Gregory
,
our
canonised
abbot
,
commenced
the
erection
of
the
sacred
edifice
above
us
.
<EOS>
At
that
epoch
were
here
enshrined
the
remains
of
the
saintly
Gregory
,
and
here
were
also
brought
the
bodies
of
Helias
de
Workesley
and
John
de
Belfield
,
both
prelates
of
piety
and
wisdom
.
<EOS>
You
may
read
the
names
where
you
stand
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
You
may
count
the
graves
of
all
the
abbots
.
<EOS>
They
are
sixteen
in
number
.
<EOS>
There
is
one
grave
yet
unoccupied
--
one
stone
yet
unfurnished
with
an
effigy
in
brass
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
sat
in
that
stall
,
my
lord
,
"
pursued
Paslew
,
pointing
to
the
abbot
's
chair
;
"
when
I
was
head
of
this
church
,
it
was
my
thought
to
rest
here
among
my
brother
abbots
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
forfeited
the
right
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
abbots
,
whose
dust
is
crumbling
beneath
us
,
died
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
;
loyal
to
their
sovereigns
,
and
true
to
their
country
,
whereas
you
will
die
an
attainted
felon
and
rebel
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
no
place
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
Concern
not
yourself
further
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
will
find
a
fitting
grave
for
you,--perchance
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
turning
abruptly
away
,
he
gave
the
signal
for
general
departure
.
 
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
the
clock
in
the
church
tower
had
tolled
one
,
the
lights
were
extinguished
,
and
of
the
priestly
train
who
had
recently
thronged
the
fane
,
all
were
gone
,
like
a
troop
of
ghosts
evoked
at
midnight
by
necromantic
skill
,
and
then
suddenly
dismissed
.
<EOS>
Deep
silence
again
brooded
in
the
aisles
<EOS>
;
hushed
was
the
organ
;
mute
the
melodious
choir
.
<EOS>
The
only
light
penetrating
the
convent
church
proceeded
from
the
moon
,
whose
rays
,
shining
through
the
painted
windows
,
fell
upon
the
graves
of
the
old
abbots
in
the
presbytery
,
and
on
the
two
biers
within
the
adjoining
chapel
,
whose
stark
burthens
they
quickened
into
fearful
semblance
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VI.--TETER
ET
FORTIS
CARCER
.
  
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
and
unable
to
pray
,
the
abbot
strove
to
dissipate
his
agitation
of
spirit
by
walking
to
and
fro
within
his
chamber
;
and
while
thus
occupied
,
he
was
interrupted
by
a
guard
,
who
told
him
that
the
priest
sent
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
was
without
,
and
immediately
afterwards
the
confessor
was
ushered
in
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
tall
monk
,
who
had
been
standing
between
the
biers
,
and
his
features
were
still
shrouded
by
his
cowl
.
<EOS>
At
sight
of
him
,
Paslew
sank
upon
a
seat
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
The
monk
offered
him
no
consolation
,
but
waited
in
silence
till
he
should
again
look
up
.
<EOS>
At
last
Paslew
took
courage
and
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
,
and
what
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
brother
of
the
same
order
as
yourself
,
"
replied
the
monk
,
in
deep
and
thrilling
accents
,
but
without
raising
his
hood
;
"
and
I
am
come
to
hear
your
confession
by
command
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
of
this
abbey
?
"
asked
Paslew
,
tremblingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
"
replied
the
monk
,
in
a
stern
tone
;
"
but
the
monastery
is
dissolved
,
and
all
the
brethren
ejected
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
name
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Paslew
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
come
here
to
answer
questions
,
but
to
hear
a
confession
,
"
rejoined
the
monk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bethink
you
of
the
awful
situation
in
which
you
are
placed
,
and
that
before
many
hours
you
must
answer
for
the
sins
you
have
committed
.
<EOS>
You
have
yet
time
for
repentance
,
if
you
delay
it
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
father
,
"
replied
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
"
Be
seated
,
I
pray
you
,
and
listen
to
me
,
for
I
have
much
to
tell
.
<EOS>
Thirty
and
one
years
ago
I
was
prior
of
this
abbey
.
<EOS>
Up
to
that
period
my
life
had
been
blameless
,
or
,
if
not
wholly
free
from
fault
,
I
had
little
wherewith
to
reproach
myself
--
little
to
fear
from
a
merciful
judge
--
unless
it
were
that
I
indulged
too
strongly
the
desire
of
ruling
absolutely
in
the
house
in
which
I
was
then
only
second
.
<EOS>
But
Satan
had
laid
a
snare
for
me
,
into
which
I
blindly
fell
.
<EOS>
Among
the
brethren
was
one
named
Borlace
Alvetham
,
a
young
man
of
rare
attainment
,
and
singular
skill
in
the
occult
sciences
.
<EOS>
He
had
risen
in
favour
,
and
at
the
time
I
speak
of
was
elected
sub
-
prior
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
said
the
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
began
to
be
whispered
about
within
the
abbey
,
"
pursued
Paslew
,
"
<EOS>
that
on
the
death
of
William
Rede
,
then
abbot
,
Borlace
Alvetham
would
succeed
him
,
and
then
it
was
that
bitter
feelings
of
animosity
were
awakened
in
my
breast
against
the
sub
-
prior
,
and
,
after
many
struggles
,
I
resolved
upon
his
destruction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
wicked
resolution
,
"
cried
the
monk
;
"
but
proceed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
pondered
over
the
means
of
accomplishing
my
purpose
,
"
resumed
Paslew
,
"
and
at
last
decided
upon
accusing
Alvetham
of
sorcery
and
magical
practices
.
<EOS>
The
accusation
was
easy
,
for
the
occult
studies
in
which
he
indulged
laid
him
open
to
the
charge
.
<EOS>
He
occupied
a
chamber
overlooking
the
Calder
,
and
used
to
break
the
monastic
rules
by
wandering
forth
at
night
upon
the
hills
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
absent
thus
one
night
,
accompanied
by
others
of
the
brethren
,
I
visited
his
chamber
,
and
examined
his
papers
,
some
of
which
were
covered
with
mystical
figures
and
cabalistic
characters
.
<EOS>
These
papers
I
seized
,
and
a
watch
was
set
to
make
prisoner
of
Alvetham
on
his
return
.
<EOS>
Before
dawn
he
appeared
,
and
was
instantly
secured
,
and
placed
in
close
confinement
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
he
was
brought
before
the
assembled
conclave
in
the
chapter
-
house
,
and
examined
.
<EOS>
His
defence
was
unavailing
.
<EOS>
I
charged
him
with
the
terrible
crime
of
witchcraft
,
and
he
was
found
guilty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
hollow
groan
broke
from
the
monk
,
but
he
offered
no
other
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
condemned
to
die
a
fearful
and
lingering
death
,
"
pursued
the
abbot
;
"
and
it
devolved
upon
me
to
see
the
sentence
carried
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
no
pity
for
the
innocent
moved
you
?
"
cried
the
monk
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
no
compunction
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
,
"
replied
the
abbot
;
"
I
rather
rejoiced
in
the
successful
accomplishment
of
my
scheme
.
<EOS>
The
prey
was
fairly
in
my
toils
,
and
I
would
give
him
no
chance
of
escape
.
<EOS>
Not
to
bring
scandal
upon
the
abbey
,
it
was
decided
that
Alvetham
's
punishment
should
be
secret
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
wise
resolve
,
"
observed
the
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Within
the
thickness
of
the
dormitory
walls
is
contrived
a
small
singularly
-
formed
dungeon
,
"
continued
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
"
It
consists
of
an
arched
cell
,
just
large
enough
to
hold
the
body
of
a
captive
,
and
permit
him
to
stretch
himself
upon
a
straw
pallet
.
<EOS>
A
narrow
staircase
mounts
upwards
to
a
grated
aperture
in
one
of
the
buttresses
to
admit
air
and
light
.
<EOS>
Other
opening
is
there
none
.
'
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Teter
<EOS>
et
fortis
carcer
_
'
is
this
dungeon
styled
in
our
monastic
rolls
,
and
it
is
well
described
,
for
it
is
black
and
strong
enough
.
<EOS>
Food
is
admitted
to
the
miserable
inmate
of
the
cell
by
means
of
a
revolving
stone
,
but
no
interchange
of
speech
can
be
held
with
those
without
.
<EOS>
A
large
stone
is
removed
from
the
wall
to
admit
the
prisoner
,
and
once
immured
,
the
masonry
is
mortised
,
and
made
solid
as
before
.
<EOS>
The
wretched
captive
does
not
long
survive
his
doom
,
or
it
may
be
he
lives
too
long
,
for
death
must
be
a
release
from
such
protracted
misery
.
<EOS>
In
this
dark
cell
one
of
the
evil
-
minded
brethren
,
who
essayed
to
stab
the
Abbot
of
Kirkstall
in
the
chapter
-
house
,
was
thrust
,
and
ere
a
year
was
over
,
the
provisions
were
untouched
--
and
the
man
being
known
to
be
dead
,
they
were
stayed
.
<EOS>
His
skeleton
was
found
within
the
cell
when
it
was
opened
to
admit
Borlace
Alvetham
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
captive
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
poor
captive
!
"
echoed
Paslew
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mine
eyes
have
often
striven
to
pierce
those
stone
walls
,
and
see
him
lying
there
in
that
narrow
chamber
,
or
forcing
his
way
upwards
,
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
sky
above
him
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
seen
the
swallows
settle
on
the
old
buttress
,
or
the
thin
grass
growing
between
the
stones
waving
there
,
I
have
thought
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
said
the
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
scarce
can
proceed
,
"
rejoined
Paslew
.
<EOS>
"
Little
time
was
allowed
Alvetham
for
preparation
.
<EOS>
That
very
night
the
fearful
sentence
was
carried
out
.
<EOS>
The
stone
was
removed
,
and
a
new
pallet
placed
in
the
cell
.
<EOS>
At
midnight
the
prisoner
was
brought
to
the
dormitory
,
the
brethren
chanting
a
doleful
hymn
.
<EOS>
There
he
stood
amidst
them
,
his
tall
form
towering
above
the
rest
,
and
his
features
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
He
protested
his
innocence
,
but
he
exhibited
no
fear
,
even
when
he
saw
the
terrible
preparations
.
<EOS>
When
all
was
ready
he
was
led
to
the
breach
.
<EOS>
At
that
awful
moment
,
his
eye
met
mine
,
and
I
shall
never
forget
the
look
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
saved
him
if
I
had
spoken
,
but
I
would
not
speak
.
<EOS>
I
turned
away
,
and
he
was
thrust
into
the
breach
.
<EOS>
A
fearful
cry
then
rang
in
my
ears
,
but
it
was
instantly
drowned
by
the
mallets
of
the
masons
employed
to
fasten
up
the
stone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
for
a
few
moments
,
broken
only
by
the
sobs
of
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
monk
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
prisoner
perished
in
the
cell
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
in
a
hollow
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
till
to
-
night
,
"
replied
the
abbot
.
"
<EOS>
But
if
he
escaped
it
,
it
must
have
been
by
miracle
;
or
by
aid
of
those
powers
with
whom
he
was
charged
with
holding
commerce
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
escape
!
"
<EOS>
thundered
the
monk
,
throwing
back
his
hood
.
<EOS>
"
Look
up
,
John
Paslew
.
<EOS>
Look
up
,
false
abbot
,
and
recognise
thy
victim
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Borlace
Alvetham
!
"
cried
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
indeed
,
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
and
can
you
doubt
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
shall
now
hear
how
I
avoided
the
terrible
death
to
which
you
procured
my
condemnation
.
<EOS>
You
shall
now
learn
how
I
am
here
to
repay
the
wrong
you
did
me
.
<EOS>
We
have
changed
places
,
John
Paslew
,
since
the
night
when
I
was
thrust
into
the
cell
,
never
,
as
you
hoped
,
to
come
forth
.
<EOS>
You
are
now
the
criminal
,
and
I
the
witness
of
the
punishment
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
!
<EOS>
oh
,
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
Borlace
Alvetham
,
since
you
are
,
indeed
,
he
!
"
cried
the
abbot
,
falling
on
his
knees
.
 
<EOS>
"
Arise
,
John
Paslew
!
"
cried
the
other
,
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
Arise
,
and
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
For
the
damning
offences
into
which
I
have
been
led
,
I
hold
you
responsible
.
<EOS>
But
for
you
I
might
have
died
free
from
sin
.
<EOS>
It
is
fit
you
should
know
the
amount
of
my
iniquity
.
<EOS>
Give
ear
to
me
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
When
first
shut
within
that
dungeon
,
I
yielded
to
the
promptings
of
despair
.
<EOS>
Cursing
you
,
I
threw
myself
upon
the
pallet
,
resolved
to
taste
no
food
,
and
hoping
death
would
soon
release
me
.
<EOS>
But
love
of
life
prevailed
.
<EOS>
On
the
second
day
I
took
the
bread
and
water
allotted
me
,
and
ate
and
drank
;
after
which
I
scaled
the
narrow
staircase
,
and
gazed
through
the
thin
barred
loophole
at
the
bright
blue
sky
above
,
sometimes
catching
the
shadow
of
a
bird
as
it
flew
past
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
I
yearned
for
freedom
then
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
I
wished
to
break
through
the
stone
walls
that
held
me
fast
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
weight
of
despair
crushed
my
heart
as
I
crept
back
to
my
narrow
bed
!
<EOS>
The
cell
seemed
like
a
grave
,
and
indeed
it
was
little
better
.
<EOS>
Horrible
thoughts
possessed
me
.
<EOS>
What
if
I
should
be
wilfully
forgotten
?
<EOS>
What
if
no
food
should
be
given
me
,
and
I
should
be
left
to
perish
by
the
slow
pangs
of
hunger
?
<EOS>
At
this
idea
I
shrieked
aloud
,
but
the
walls
alone
returned
a
dull
echo
to
my
cries
.
<EOS>
I
beat
my
hands
against
the
stones
,
till
the
blood
flowed
from
them
,
but
no
answer
was
returned
;
and
at
last
I
desisted
from
sheer
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
and
night
after
night
,
passed
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
My
food
regularly
came
.
<EOS>
But
I
became
maddened
by
solitude
;
and
with
terrible
imprecations
invoked
aid
from
the
powers
of
darkness
to
set
me
free
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
while
thus
employed
,
I
was
startled
by
a
mocking
voice
which
said
,
 
"
'
All
this
fury
is
needless
.
<EOS>
Thou
hast
only
to
wish
for
me
,
and
I
come
.
'
 
<EOS>
[

ALVETHAM
AND

PASLEW

<EOS>
"
It
was
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
nothing
but
a
pair
of
red
orbs
,
glowing
like
flaming
carbuncles
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Thou
wouldst
be
free
,
'
continued
the
voice
.
'
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
be
so
.
<EOS>
Arise
,
and
follow
me
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
At
this
I
felt
myself
grasped
by
an
iron
arm
,
against
which
all
resistance
would
have
been
unavailing
,
even
if
I
had
dared
to
offer
it
,
and
in
an
instant
I
was
dragged
up
the
narrow
steps
.
<EOS>
The
stone
wall
opened
before
my
unseen
conductor
,
and
in
another
moment
we
were
upon
the
roof
of
the
dormitory
.
<EOS>
By
the
bright
starbeams
shooting
down
from
above
,
I
discerned
a
tall
shadowy
figure
standing
by
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Thou
art
mine
,
'
he
cried
,
in
accents
graven
for
ever
on
my
memory
;
'
but
I
am
a
generous
master
,
and
will
give
thee
a
long
term
of
freedom
.
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
be
avenged
upon
thine
enemy
--
deeply
avenged
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
Grant
this
,
and
I
am
thine
,
'
I
replied
,
a
spirit
of
infernal
vengeance
possessing
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
knelt
before
the
fiend
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
But
thou
must
tarry
for
awhile
,
'
he
answered
,
'
for
thine
enemy
's
time
will
be
long
in
coming
;
but
it
_
will
_
come
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
work
him
immediate
harm
;
but
I
will
lead
him
to
a
height
from
which
he
will
assuredly
fall
headlong
.
<EOS>
Thou
must
depart
from
this
place
;
for
it
is
perilous
to
thee
,
and
if
thou
stayest
here
,
ill
will
befall
thee
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
a
rat
to
thy
dungeon
,
which
shall
daily
devour
the
provisions
,
so
that
the
monks
shall
not
know
thou
hast
fled
.
<EOS>
In
thirty
and
one
years
shall
the
abbot
's
doom
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Two
years
before
that
time
thou
mayst
return
.
<EOS>
Then
come
alone
to
Pendle
Hill
on
a
Friday
night
,
and
beat
the
water
of
the
moss
pool
on
the
summit
,
and
I
will
appear
to
thee
and
tell
thee
more
.
<EOS>
Nine
and
twenty
years
,
remember
!
'
 
<EOS>
"
With
these
words
the
shadowy
figure
melted
away
,
and
I
found
myself
standing
alone
on
the
mossy
roof
of
the
dormitory
.
<EOS>
The
cold
stars
were
shining
down
upon
me
,
and
I
heard
the
howl
of
the
watch
-
dogs
near
the
gate
.
<EOS>
The
fair
abbey
slept
in
beauty
around
me
,
and
I
gnashed
my
teeth
with
rage
to
think
that
you
had
made
me
an
outcast
from
it
,
and
robbed
me
of
a
dignity
which
might
have
been
mine
.
<EOS>
I
was
wroth
also
that
my
vengeance
should
be
so
long
delayed
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
remain
where
I
was
,
so
I
clambered
down
the
buttress
,
and
fled
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
this
be
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
abbot
,
who
had
listened
in
rapt
wonderment
to
the
narration
.
<EOS>
"
Two
years
after
your
immurement
in
the
cell
,
the
food
having
been
for
some
time
untouched
,
the
wall
was
opened
,
and
upon
the
pallet
was
found
a
decayed
carcase
in
mouldering
,
monkish
vestments
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
body
taken
from
the
charnel
,
and
placed
there
by
the
demon
,
"
replied
the
monk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
my
long
wanderings
in
other
lands
and
beneath
brighter
skies
I
need
not
tell
you
;
but
neither
absence
nor
lapse
of
years
cooled
my
desire
of
vengeance
,
and
when
the
appointed
time
drew
nigh
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
own
country
,
and
came
hither
in
a
lowly
garb
,
under
the
name
of
Nicholas
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
went
to
Pendle
Hill
,
as
directed
,
"
pursued
the
monk
,
"
and
saw
the
Dark
Shape
there
as
I
beheld
it
on
the
dormitory
roof
.
<EOS>
All
things
were
then
told
me
,
and
I
learnt
how
the
late
rebellion
should
rise
,
and
how
it
should
be
crushed
.
<EOS>
I
learnt
also
how
my
vengeance
should
be
satisfied
.
"
 
<EOS>
Paslew
groaned
aloud
.
<EOS>
A
brief
pause
ensued
,
and
deep
emotion
marked
the
accents
of
the
wizard
as
he
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
came
back
,
all
this
part
of
Lancashire
resounded
with
praises
of
the
beauty
of
Bess
Blackburn
,
a
rustic
lass
who
dwelt
in
Barrowford
.
<EOS>
She
was
called
the
Flower
of
Pendle
,
and
inflamed
all
the
youths
with
love
,
and
all
the
maidens
with
jealousy
.
<EOS>
But
she
favoured
none
except
Cuthbert
Ashbead
,
forester
to
the
Abbot
of
Whalley
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
would
fain
have
given
her
to
the
forester
in
marriage
,
but
Bess
would
not
be
disposed
of
so
easily
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
,
and
became
at
once
enamoured
.
<EOS>
I
thought
my
heart
was
seared
;
but
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
The
savage
beauty
of
Bess
pleased
me
more
than
the
most
refined
charms
could
have
done
,
and
her
fierce
character
harmonised
with
my
own
.
<EOS>
How
I
won
her
matters
not
,
but
she
cast
off
all
thoughts
of
Ashbead
,
and
clung
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
wild
life
suited
her
;
and
she
roamed
the
wastes
with
me
,
scaled
the
hills
in
my
company
,
and
shrank
not
from
the
weird
meetings
I
attended
.
<EOS>
Ill
repute
quickly
attended
her
,
and
she
became
branded
as
a
witch
.
<EOS>
Her
aged
mother
closed
her
doors
upon
her
,
and
those
who
would
have
gone
miles
to
meet
her
,
now
avoided
her
.
<EOS>
Bess
heeded
this
little
.
<EOS>
She
was
of
a
nature
to
repay
the
world
's
contumely
with
like
scorn
,
but
when
her
child
was
born
the
case
became
different
.
<EOS>
She
wished
to
save
it
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
,
"
pursued
Demdike
,
vehemently
,
and
regarding
the
abbot
with
flashing
<EOS>
eyes--"then
<EOS>
it
was
that
I
was
again
mortally
injured
by
you
.
<EOS>
Then
your
ruthless
decree
to
the
clergy
went
forth
.
<EOS>
My
child
was
denied
baptism
,
and
became
subject
to
the
fiend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
alas
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Paslew
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
as
if
this
were
not
injury
enough
,
"
thundered
Demdike
,
"
you
have
called
down
a
withering
and
lasting
curse
upon
its
innocent
head
,
and
through
it
transfixed
its
mother
's
heart
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
complied
with
that
poor
girl
's
request
,
I
would
have
forgiven
you
your
wrong
to
me
,
and
have
saved
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
long
,
fearful
silence
.
<EOS>
At
last
Demdike
advanced
to
the
abbot
,
and
,
seizing
his
arm
,
fixed
his
eyes
upon
him
,
as
if
to
search
into
his
soul
.
 
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
,
John
Paslew
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
"
answer
me
,
as
you
shall
speedily
answer
your
Maker
.
<EOS>
Can
that
malediction
be
recalled
?
<EOS>
Dare
not
to
trifle
with
me
,
or
I
will
tear
forth
your
black
heart
,
and
cast
it
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
Can
that
curse
be
recalled
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
,
"
replied
the
abbot
,
half
dead
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
Away
,
then
!
"
thundered
Demdike
,
casting
him
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
To
the
gallows!--to
the
gallows
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VII.--THE
ABBEY
MILL
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
while
the
abbot
remained
shattered
and
stupefied
by
this
terrible
interview
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
arose
,
and
made
his
way
,
he
scarce
knew
how
,
to
the
oratory
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
long
before
the
tumult
of
his
thoughts
could
be
at
all
allayed
,
and
he
had
only
just
regained
something
like
composure
when
he
was
disturbed
by
hearing
a
slight
sound
in
the
adjoining
chamber
.
<EOS>
A
mortal
chill
came
over
him
,
for
he
thought
it
might
be
Demdike
returned
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
he
distinguished
a
footstep
stealthily
approaching
him
,
and
almost
hoped
that
the
wizard
would
consummate
his
vengeance
by
taking
his
life
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
quickly
undeceived
,
for
a
hand
was
placed
on
his
shoulder
,
and
a
friendly
voice
whispered
in
his
ears
,
"
Cum
along
wi
'
meh
,
lort
abbut
.
<EOS>
Get
up
,
quick
--
quick
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
addressed
,
the
abbot
raised
his
eyes
,
and
beheld
a
rustic
figure
standing
beside
him
,
divested
of
his
clouted
shoes
,
and
armed
with
a
long
bare
wood
-
knife
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dunna

cried
the
person
.

<EOS>
But
the
abbot
stirred
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quick

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
implored
<EOS>
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
venturing
to

<EOS>
"
I

friend
,
from
the
bottom
of
my

"
replied
the
abbot
,
rising
;
"
but

however

the
temptation

liberty

"
 
<EOS>
"
Whot

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Hal
o

Nabs
,
in
a
tone
of
bitter
disappointment
;

"
Forbear

"
rejoined
Paslew
.
<EOS>
"
I
fully
appreciate

<EOS>
Poor
Cuthbert
Ashbead
!
<EOS>
when
I
beheld
his
body
on
the
bier
,
I
had
a
sad

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
he
added
,
brandishing
his
knife
fiercely
<EOS>
,
"

<EOS>
"
Peace

"
rejoined
the
abbot
,
"
and

.
<EOS>
Leave

wretched

to
the
chastisement
of

<EOS>
And

"
 
<EOS>
"
Yo

"
<EOS>
cried
Hal
o'Nabs
,
scratching
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
replied
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cum
wi
'

then
,
"
pursued
Hal
,
"
and
tell
Ebil
so
.
<EOS>
He
'll
think
ey'n
failed
else
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Willingly
,
"
replied
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
And
with
noiseless
footsteps
he
followed
the
other
across
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
window
was
open
,
and
outside
it
was
reared
a
ladder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
mun
go
down
a
few
steps

"
said
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
"
or
else
he
'll

.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
complied
,
and
partly
descended
the
ladder
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
one
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
T
'
neet

"
replied
<EOS>
Hal
o

Nabs
,
who
was
close

him
.
"
<EOS>
Ebil
canna

<EOS>
Hist
!
<EOS>
ey
hear
him
--
go
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
was
now
obliged
to
comply
,
though
he
did
so
with
,
reluctance
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
found
himself
upon
the
roof
of
a
building
,
which
he
knew
to
be
connected
with
the
mill
by
a
covered
passage
running
along
the
south
bank
of
the
Calder
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
he
set
foot
there
,
than
Hal
o
'
<EOS>
Nabs
jumped
after
him
,
and
,
seizing
the
ladder
,
cast
it
into
the
stream
,
thus
rendering
Paslew
's
return
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw

he
cried
,
with
a
low
,
exulting
laugh
,
"

"
 
<EOS>
"
You

"
cried
the

,
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
"

replied
Hal
;
"

<EOS>
This

"
 
<EOS>
And
taking
Paslew
's
arm
he
led
him
to
a
low
parapet
,
overlooking
the
covered
passage
before
described
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
before
it
had
been
bright
moonlight
,
but
,
as
if
to
favour
the
fugitive
,
the
heavens
had
become
overcast
,
and
a
thick
mist
had
arisen
from
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ebil

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
cried
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
leaning
over
the
parapet
.
 
<EOS>
"

replied
a
voice
below
.
<EOS>
"

"
Never

returned
Hal

"

"
 
<EOS>
Paslew
thought
it
vain
to
resist
further
,
and
with
the
help
of
Hal
o
'
Nabs
and
the
miller
,
and
further
aided
by
some
irregularities
in
the
wall
,
he
was
soon
safely
landed
near
the
entrance
of
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Abel
fell
on
his
knees
,
and
pressed
the
abbot
's
hand
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
Owr

"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dunna

"
interposed
<EOS>
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
who
by
this
time
had
reached
the
ground
,
and
who
was
fearful
of
some
new
remonstrance
on
the
abbot
's
part
.
"
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
"

the

"

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
marched
along
the
passage
,
followed
by
the
others
,
and
presently
arrived
at
a
door
,
against
which
he
tapped
.
<EOS>
A
bolt
being
withdrawn
,
it
was
instantly
opened
to
admit
the
party
,
after
which
it
was
as
quickly
shut
,
and
secured
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
a
call
from
the
miller
,
a
light
appeared
at
the
top
of
a
steep
,
ladder
-
like
flight
of
wooden
steps
,
and
up
these
Paslew
,
at
the
entreaty
of
Abel
,
mounted
,
and
found
himself
in
a
large
,
low
chamber
,
the
roof
of
which
was
crossed
by
great
beams
,
covered
thickly
with
cobwebs
,
whitened
by
flour
,
while
the
floor
was
strewn
with
empty
sacks
and
sieves
.
 
<EOS>
The
person
who
held
the
light
proved
to
be
the
miller
's
daughter
,
Dorothy
,
a
blooming
lass
of
eighteen
,
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
chamber
,
seated
on
a
bench
before
a
turf
fire
,
with
an
infant
on
her
knees
,
was
the
miller
's
wife
.
<EOS>
The
latter
instantly
arose
on
beholding
the
abbot
,
and
,
placing
the
child
on
a
corn
bin
,
advanced
towards
him
,
and
dropped
on
her
knees
,
while
her
daughter
imitated
her
example
.
<EOS>
The
abbot
extended
his
hands
over
them
,
and
pronounced
a
solemn
benediction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
your
child
also
to
me
,
that
I
may
bless
it
,
"
he
said
,
when
he
concluded
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
nah
my
child
,
lort
abbut
,
"
replied
the
miller
's
wife
,
taking
up
the
infant
and
bringing
it
to
him
;
"
it

brought
to

<EOS>
Ey

"
 
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
she
pointed
to
the
infant
's
face
,
which
was
disfigured
as
she
had
stated
,
by
a
strange
and
unnatural
disposition
of
the
eyes
,
one
of
which
was
set
much
lower
in
the
head
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
Awakened
from
sleep
,
the
child
uttered
a
feeble
cry
,
and
stretched
out
its
tiny
arms
to
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
pity

for

observed
the
young
damsel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Marry

cried
her

,
sharply
,
"

"

kindly
.
 
<EOS>
"
An

returned
the

wife
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is

"
cried
Paslew
,
recoiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
,
"
exclaimed
the
miller
's
wife
.
<EOS>
And
mistaking
the
cause
of
Paslew
's
emotion
,
she
added
,
triumphantly
,
to
her
daughter
,
"
<EOS>
Ey

<EOS>
Look

"
 
<EOS>
But
Paslew
heeded
her
not
,
but
murmured
to
himself:--
 
<EOS>
"
Ever
in
my
path
,
go
where
I
will
.
<EOS>
It
is
vain
to

with

<EOS>
I

and

Earl
of

.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nah,--nah!--yo

that
,
"
replied
<EOS>
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
who
,
with
the
miller
,
was
close
beside
him
.
<EOS>
"
Sit

"
<EOS>
And
he
nudged
the
damsel
's
elbow
,
who
turned
away
,
covered
with
blushes
.
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
moved
mechanically
to
the
fire
,
and
sat
down
,
while
the
miller
's
wife
,
surrendering
the
child
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
grimace
to
her
daughter
,
went
in
search
of
some
viands
and
a
flask
of
wine
,
which
she
set
before
Paslew
.
<EOS>
The
miller
then
filled
a
drinking
-
horn
,
and
presented
it
to
his
guest
,
who
was
about
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
,
when
a
loud
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
below
.
 
<EOS>
The
knocking
continued
with
increased
violence
,
and
voices
were
heard
calling
upon
the
miller
to
open
the
door
,
or
it
would
be
broken
down
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
alarm
Abel
had
flown
to
a
small
window
whence
he
could
reconnoitre
those
below
,
and
he
now
returned
with
a
face
white
with
terror
,
to
say
that
a
party
of
arquebussiers
,
with
the
sheriff
at
their
head
,
were
without
,
and
that
some
of
the
men
were
provided
with
torches
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
discovered
my
evasion
,
and
are
come
in
search
of
me
,
"
observed
the
abbot
rising
,
but
without
betraying
any
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
concern
yourselves
further
for
me
,
my
good
friends
,
but
open
the

,
and

.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nah

cried
Hal

,
"

<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
And
as
Abel
snatched
up
the
light
,
and
hastily
descended
the
steps
with
Paslew
,
Hal
whispered
in
Dorothy
's
ears--
 
<EOS>
"
Tak

<EOS>
Mey

"
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
poor
girl
,
who
,
as
well
as
her
mother
,
was
almost
frightened
out
of
her
wits
,
promised
compliance
,
he
hurried
down
the
steps
after
the
others
,
muttering
,
as
the
clamour
without
was
redoubled--
 
<EOS>
"
Eigh

<EOS>
Yo
winnaw

"
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
abbot
had
been
led
to
the
chief
room
of
the
mill
,
where
all
the
corn
formerly
consumed
within
the
monastery
had
been
prepared
,
and
which
the
size
of
the
chamber
itself
,
together
with
the
vastness
of
the
stones
used
in
the
operation
of
grinding
,
and
connected
with
the
huge
water
-
wheel
outside
,
proved
to
be
by
no
means
inconsiderable
.
<EOS>
Strong
shafts
of
timber
supported
the
flooring
above
,
and
were
crossed
by
other
boards
placed
horizontally
,
from
which
various
implements
in
use
at
the
mill
depended
,
giving
the
chamber
,
imperfectly
lighted
as
it
now
was
by
the
lamp
borne
by
Abel
,
a
strange
and
almost
mysterious
appearance
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
of
the
miller
's
men
,
armed
with
pikes
,
had
followed
their
master
,
and
,
though
much
alarmed
,
they
vowed
to
die
rather
than
give
up
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
Hal
o
'
Nabs
had
joined
the
group
,
and
proceeding
towards
a
raised
part
of
the
chamber
where
the
grinding
-
stones
were
set
,
he
knelt
down
,
and
laying
hold
of
a
small
ring
,
raised
up
a
trapdoor
.
<EOS>
The
fresh
air
which
blew
up
through
the
aperture
,
combined
with
the
rushing
sound
of
water
,
showed
that
the
Calder
flowed
immediately
beneath
;
and
,
having
made
some
slight
preparation
,
Hal
let
himself
down
into
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
loud
crash
was
heard
,
and
one
of
the
miller
's
men
cried
out
that
the
arquebussiers
had
burst
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
hondy
,
then
,
lads
,
and
let
him
down
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
who
had
some
difficulty
in
maintaining
his
footing
on
the
rough
,
stony
bottom
of
the
swift
stream
.
 
<EOS>
Passively
yielding
,
the
abbot
suffered
the
miller
and
one
of
the
stoutest
of
his
men
to
assist
him
through
the
trapdoor
,
while
a
third
held
down
the
lamp
,
and
showed
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
up
to
his
middle
in
the
darkling
current
,
and
stretching
out
his
arms
to
receive
the
burden
.
<EOS>
The
light
fell
upon
the
huge
black
circle
of
the
watershed
now
stopped
,
and
upon
the
dripping
arches
supporting
the
mill
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
the
abbot
plunged
into
the
water
,
the
trapdoor
was
replaced
,
and
bolted
underneath
by
Hal
,
who
,
while
guiding
his
companion
along
,
and
bidding
him
catch
hold
of
the
wood
-
work
of
the
wheel
,
heard
a
heavy
trampling
of
many
feet
on
the
boards
above
,
showing
that
the
pursuers
had
obtained
admittance
.
 
<EOS>
Encumbered
by
his
heavy
vestments
,
the
abbot
could
with
difficulty
contend
against
the
strong
current
,
and
he
momently
expected
to
be
swept
away
;
but
he
had
a
stout
and
active
assistant
by
his
side
,
who
soon
placed
him
under
shelter
of
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
The
trampling
overhead
continued
for
a
few
minutes
,
after
which
all
was
quiet
,
and
Hal
judged
that
,
finding
their
search
within
ineffectual
,
the
enemy
would
speedily
come
forth
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
deceived
.
<EOS>
Shouts
were
soon
heard
at
the
door
of
the
mill
,
and
the
glare
of
torches
was
cast
on
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
Hal
dragged
his
companion
into
a
deep
hole
,
formed
by
some
decay
in
the
masonry
,
behind
the
wheel
,
where
the
water
rose
nearly
to
their
chins
,
and
where
they
were
completely
concealed
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
they
thus
ensconced
,
than
two
or
three
armed
men
,
holding
torches
aloft
,
were
seen
wading
under
the
archway
;
but
after
looking
carefully
around
,
and
even
approaching
close
to
the
water
-
wheel
,
these
persons
could
detect
nothing
,
and
withdrew
,
muttering
curses
of
rage
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
the
lights
almost
wholly
disappeared
,
and
the
shouts
becoming
fainter
and
more
distant
,
it
was
evident
that
the
men
had
gone
lower
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Hal
thought
they
might
venture
to
quit
their
retreat
,
and
accordingly
,
grasping
the
abbot
's
arm
,
he
proceeded
to
wade
up
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
Benumbed
with
cold
,
and
half
dead
with
terror
,
Paslew
needed
all
his
companion
's
support
,
for
he
could
do
little
to
help
himself
,
added
to
which
,
they
occasionally
encountered
some
large
stone
,
or
stepped
into
a
deep
hole
,
so
that
it
required
Hal
's
utmost
exertion
and
strength
to
force
a
way
on
.
<EOS>
At
last
they
were
out
of
the
arch
,
and
though
both
banks
seemed
unguarded
,
yet
,
for
fear
of
surprise
,
Hal
deemed
it
prudent
still
to
keep
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
Their
course
was
completely
sheltered
from
observation
by
the
mist
that
enveloped
them
;
and
after
proceeding
in
this
way
for
some
distance
,
Hal
stopped
to
listen
,
and
while
debating
with
himself
whether
he
should
now
quit
the
river
,
he
fancied
he
beheld
a
black
object
swimming
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Taking
it
for
an
otter
,
with
which
voracious
animal
the
Calder
,
a
stream
swarming
with
trout
,
abounded
,
and
knowing
the
creature
would
not
meddle
with
them
unless
first
attacked
,
he
paid
little
attention
to
it
;
but
he
was
soon
made
sensible
of
his
error
.
<EOS>
His
arm
was
suddenly
seized
by
a
large
black
hound
,
whose
sharp
fangs
met
in
his
flesh
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
repress
a
cry
of
pain
,
Hal
strove
to
disengage
himself
from
his
assailant
,
and
,
finding
it
impossible
,
flung
himself
into
the
water
in
the
hope
of
drowning
him
,
but
,
as
the
hound
still
maintained
his
hold
,
he
searched
for
his
knife
to
slay
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
find
it
,
and
in
his
distress
applied
to
Paslew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha

"
he
cried
,
"

"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Paslew
,
"
and
I
fear
no
weapon
will
prevail
against
it
,
for
I
recognise
in
the
animal
the
hound
of
the
wizard
,
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

rejoined
Hal
;
"

<EOS>

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
Feeling
he
should
sink
if
he
remained
where
he
was
,
and
wholly
unable
to
offer
any
effectual
assistance
to
his
companion
,
the
abbot
turned
to
the
left
,
where
a
large
oak
overhung
the
stream
,
and
he
was
climbing
the
bank
,
aided
by
the
roots
of
the
tree
,
when
a
man
suddenly
came
from
behind
it
,
seized
his
hand
,
and
dragged
him
up
forcibly
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
his
captor
placed
a
bugle
to
his
lips
,
and
winding
a
few
notes
,
he
was
instantly
answered
by
shouts
,
and
soon
afterwards
half
a
dozen
armed
men
ran
up
,
bearing
torches
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
passed
between
the
fugitive
and
his
captor
;
but
when
the
men
came
up
,
and
the
torchlight
fell
upon
the
features
of
the
latter
,
the
abbot
's
worst
fears
were
realised
.
<EOS>
It
was
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
False
to
your
king!--false
to
your
oath!--false
to
all
men
!
"
cried
the
wizard
.
<EOS>
"
You
seek
to
escape
in
vain
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
merit
all
your
reproaches
,
"
replied
the
abbot
;
"
but
it
may
he
some
satisfaction
,
to
you
to
learn
,
that
I
have
endured
far
greater
suffering
than
if
I
had
patiently
awaited
my
doom
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
rejoined
Demdike
,
with
a
savage
laugh
;
"
but
you
have
destroyed
others
beside
yourself
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
fellow
in
the
water
?
<EOS>
What
,
ho
,
Uriel
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
as
no
sound
reached
him
,
he
snatched
a
torch
from
one
of
the
arquebussiers
and
held
it
to
the
river
's
brink
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
see
neither
hound
nor
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Strange
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
have
escaped
.
<EOS>
Uriel
is
more
than
a
match
for
any
man
.
<EOS>
Secure
the
prisoner
while
I
examine
the
stream
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
ran
along
the
bank
with
great
quickness
,
holding
his
torch
far
over
the
water
,
so
as
to
reveal
any
thing
floating
within
it
,
but
nothing
met
his
view
until
he
came
within
a
short
distance
of
the
mill
,
when
he
beheld
a
black
object
struggling
in
the
current
,
and
soon
found
that
it
was
his
dog
making
feeble
efforts
to
gain
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
recreant
!
<EOS>
thou
hast
let
him
go
,
"
cried
Demdike
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
his
master
the
animal
redoubled
its
efforts
,
crept
ashore
,
and
fell
at
his
feet
,
with
a
last
effort
to
lick
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Demdike
held
down
the
torch
,
and
then
perceived
that
the
hound
was
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
deep
gash
in
its
side
,
and
another
in
the
throat
,
showing
how
it
had
perished
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Uriel
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
;
"
the
only
true
friend
I
had
.
<EOS>
And
thou
art
gone
!
<EOS>
The
villain
has
killed
thee
,
but
he
shall
pay
for
it
with
his
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
hurrying
back
he
dispatched
four
of
the
men
in
quest
of
the
fugitive
,
while
accompanied
by
the
two
others
he
conveyed
Paslew
back
to
the
abbey
,
where
he
was
placed
in
a
strong
cell
,
from
which
there
was
no
possibility
of
escape
,
and
a
guard
set
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
after
this
,
two
of
the
arquebussiers
returned
with
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
whom
they
had
succeeded
in
capturing
after
a
desperate
resistance
,
about
a
mile
from
the
abbey
,
on
the
road
to
Wiswall
.
<EOS>
He
was
taken
to
the
guard
-
room
,
which
had
been
appointed
in
one
of
the
lower
chambers
of
the
chapter
-
house
,
and
Demdike
was
immediately
apprised
of
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
by
an
inspection
of
the
prisoner
,
whose
demeanour
was
sullen
and
resolved
,
Demdike
proceeded
to
the
great
hall
,
where
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
had
returned
thither
after
the
midnight
mass
,
was
still
sitting
with
his
retainers
.
<EOS>
An
audience
was
readily
obtained
by
the
wizard
,
and
,
apparently
well
pleased
with
the
result
,
he
returned
to
the
guard
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
was
seated
by
himself
in
one
corner
of
the
chamber
,
with
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
with
a
leathern
thong
,
and
Demdike
approaching
him
,
told
him
that
,
for
having
aided
the
escape
of
a
condemned
rebel
and
traitor
,
and
violently
assaulting
the
king
's
lieges
in
the
execution
of
their
duty
,
he
would
be
hanged
on
the
morrow
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
had
power
of
life
or
death
in
such
cases
,
having
so
decreed
it
.
<EOS>
And
he
exhibited
the
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Soh
,
yo

to
hong

"
<EOS>
cried
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
kicking
his
heels
with
great
apparent
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Demdike
;
"
if
for
nothing
else
,
for
slaying
my
hound

"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

cried

"

"
 
<EOS>
"
Yo'n

said
Hal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tush

<EOS>
cried
Demdike
,
"
my
only
regret
will
be
that
Uriel

a

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then

demanded
Hal
.
"
<EOS>
'

<EOS>
"

surprised

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Curses

"
cried
Demdike
;
"
but
I
will
not
be
outwitted
by

<EOS>
I

"

rejoined
Hal

<EOS>
"
We

"
cried
Demdike
,
rushing
forth
,
and
bidding
the
guards
look
well
to
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
But
ere
long
he
returned
with
a
gloomy
and
disappointed
expression
of
countenance
,
and
again
approaching
the
prisoner
<EOS>
said
,
"
Thou
hast
spoken

<EOS>
The

Demdike

"
Will

<EOS>
asked
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
Hal

"
 
<EOS>
Demdike
turned
away
disdainfully
,
and
addressing
the
arquebussiers
,
said
,
"
You
behold
this
warrant
,
guard
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
is
committed
to
my
custody
.
<EOS>
I

him

,
or

.
"
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
arquebussiers
examined
the
order
,
and
vouching
for
its
correctness
,
the
others
signified
their
assent
to
the
arrangement
,
upon
which
Demdike
motioned
the
prisoner
to
follow
him
,
and
quitted
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
No
interruption
was
offered
to
Hal
's
egress
,
but
he
stopped
within
the
court
-
yard
,
where
Demdike
awaited
him
,
and
unfastened
the
leathern
thong
that
bound
together
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
go
and
bring

said
the
wizard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nah

"
 
<EOS>
And
without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
he
ran
off
with
great
swiftness
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
time
Demdike
sought
the
church
,
and
as
he
drew
near
it
there
issued
from
the
porch
a
female
,
who
hastily
placing
the
child
,
wrapped
in
a
mantle
,
in
his
arms
,
tarried
for
no
speech
from
him
,
but
instantly
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Demdike
,
however
,
recognised
in
her
the
miller

daughter
,
Dorothy
Croft
.

CHAPTER
VIII.--THE
EXECUTIONER
.
  
<EOS>
Dawn
came
at
last
,
after
a
long
and
weary
night
to
many
within
and
without
the
abbey
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
betokened
a
dismal
day
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
was
damp
,
and
oppressive
to
the
spirits
,
while
the
raw
cold
sensibly
affected
the
frame
.
<EOS>
All
astir
were
filled
with
gloom
and
despondency
,
and
secretly
breathed
a
wish
that
,
the
tragical
business
of
the
day
were
ended
.
<EOS>
The
vast
range
of
Pendle
was
obscured
by
clouds
,
and
ere
long
the
vapours
descended
into
the
valleys
,
and
rain
began
to
fall
;
at
first
slightly
,
but
afterwards
in
heavy
continuous
showers
.
<EOS>
Melancholy
was
the
aspect
of
the
abbey
,
and
it
required
no
stretch
of
imagination
to
fancy
that
the
old
structure
was
deploring
the
fate
of
its
former
ruler
.
<EOS>
To
those
impressed
with
the
idea
--
and
many
there
were
who
were
so
--
<EOS>
the
very
stones
of
the
convent
church
seemed
dissolving
into
tears
.
<EOS>
The
statues
of
the
saints
appeared
to
weep
,
and
the
great
statue
of
Saint
Gregory
de
Northbury
over
the
porch
seemed
bowed
down
with
grief
.
<EOS>
The
grotesquely
carved
heads
on
the
spouts
grinned
horribly
at
the
abbot
's
destroyers
,
and
spouted
forth
cascades
of
water
,
as
if
with
the
intent
of
drowning
them
.
<EOS>
So
deluging
and
incessant
were
the
showers
,
that
it
seemed
,
indeed
,
as
if
the
abbey
would
be
flooded
.
<EOS>
All
the
inequalities
of
ground
within
the
great
quadrangle
of
the
cloisters
looked
like
ponds
,
and
the
various
water
-
spouts
from
the
dormitory
,
the
refectory
,
and
the
chapter
-
house
,
continuing
to
jet
forth
streams
into
the
court
below
,
the
ambulatories
were
soon
filled
ankle
-
deep
,
and
even
the
lower
apartments
,
on
which
they
opened
,
invaded
.
 
<EOS>
Surcharged
with
moisture
,
the
royal
banner
on
the
gate
drooped
and
clung
to
the
staff
,
as
if
it
too
shared
in
the
general
depression
,
or
as
if
the
sovereign
authority
it
represented
had
given
way
.
<EOS>
The
countenances
and
deportment
of
the
men
harmonized
with
the
weather
;
they
moved
about
gloomily
and
despondently
,
their
bright
accoutrements
sullied
with
the
wet
,
and
their
buskins
clogged
with
mire
.
<EOS>
A
forlorn
sight
<EOS>
it
was
to
watch
the
shivering
sentinels
on
the
walls
;
and
yet
more
forlorn
to
see
the
groups
of
the
abbot
's
old
retainers
gathering
without
,
wrapped
in
their
blue
woollen
cloaks
,
patiently
enduring
the
drenching
showers
,
and
awaiting
the
last
awful
scene
.
<EOS>
But
the
saddest
sight
of
all
was
on
the
hill
,
already
described
,
called
the
Holehouses
.
<EOS>
Here
two
other
lesser
gibbets
had
been
erected
during
the
night
,
one
on
either
hand
of
the
loftier
instrument
of
justice
,
and
the
carpenters
were
yet
employed
in
finishing
their
work
,
having
been
delayed
by
the
badness
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
Half
drowned
by
the
torrents
that
fell
upon
them
,
the
poor
fellows
were
protected
from
interference
with
their
disagreeable
occupation
by
half
a
dozen
well
-
mounted
and
well
-
armed
troopers
,
and
by
as
many
halberdiers
;
and
this
company
,
completely
exposed
to
the
weather
,
suffered
severely
from
wet
and
cold
.
<EOS>
The
rain
beat
against
the
gallows
,
ran
down
its
tall
naked
posts
,
and
collected
in
pools
at
its
feet
.
<EOS>
Attracted
by
some
strange
instinct
,
which
seemed
to
give
them
a
knowledge
of
the
object
of
these
terrible
preparations
,
two
ravens
wheeled
screaming
round
the
fatal
tree
,
and
at
length
one
of
them
settled
on
the
cross
-
beam
,
and
could
with
difficulty
be
dislodged
by
the
shouts
of
the
men
,
when
it
flew
away
,
croaking
hoarsely
.
<EOS>
Up
this
gentle
hill
,
ordinarily
so
soft
and
beautiful
,
but
now
abhorrent
as
a
Golgotha
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
beholders
,
groups
of
rustics
and
monks
had
climbed
over
ground
rendered
slippery
with
moisture
,
and
had
gathered
round
the
paling
encircling
the
terrible
apparatus
,
looking
the
images
of
despair
and
woe
.
 
<EOS>
Even
those
within
the
abbey
,
and
sheltered
from
the
storm
,
shared
the
all
-
pervading
despondency
.
<EOS>
The
refectory
looked
dull
and
comfortless
,
and
the
logs
on
the
hearth
hissed
and
sputtered
,
and
would
not
burn
.
<EOS>
Green
wood
had
been
brought
instead
of
dry
fuel
by
the
drowsy
henchman
.
<EOS>
The
viands
on
the
board
provoked
not
the
appetite
,
and
the
men
emptied
their
cups
of
ale
,
yawned
and
stretched
their
arms
,
as
if
they
would
fain
sleep
an
hour
or
two
longer
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
discomfort
,
was
heightened
by
the
entrance
of
those
whose
term
of
watch
had
been
relieved
,
and
who
cast
their
dripping
cloaks
on
the
floor
,
while
two
or
three
savage
dogs
,
steaming
with
moisture
,
stretched
their
huge
lengths
before
the
sullen
fire
,
and
disputed
all
approach
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Within
the
great
hall
were
already
gathered
the
retainers
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
but
the
nobleman
himself
had
not
appeared
.
<EOS>
Having
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
conference
with
one
person
or
another
,
and
the
abbot
's
flight
having
caused
him
much
disquietude
,
though
he
did
not
hear
of
it
till
the
fugitive
was
recovered
;
the
earl
would
not
seek
his
couch
until
within
an
hour
of
daybreak
,
and
his
attendants
,
considering
the
state
of
the
weather
,
and
that
it
yet
wanted
full
two
hours
to
the
time
appointed
for
the
execution
,
did
not
think
it
needful
to
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
Braddyll
and
Assheton
,
however
,
were
up
and
ready
;
but
,
despite
their
firmness
of
nerve
,
they
yielded
like
the
rest
to
the
depressing
influence
of
the
weather
,
and
began
to
have
some
misgivings
as
to
their
own
share
in
the
tragedy
about
to
be
enacted
.
<EOS>
The
various
gentlemen
in
attendance
paced
to
and
fro
within
the
hall
,
holding
but
slight
converse
together
,
anxiously
counting
the
minutes
,
for
the
time
appeared
to
pass
on
with
unwonted
slowness
,
and
ever
and
anon
glancing
through
the
diamond
panes
of
the
window
at
the
rain
pouring
down
steadily
without
,
and
coming
back
again
hopeless
of
amendment
in
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
If
such
were
the
disheartening
influence
of
the
day
on
those
who
had
nothing
to
apprehend
,
what
must
its
effect
have
been
on
the
poor
captives
!
<EOS>
Woful
indeed
.
<EOS>
The
two
monks
suffered
a
complete
prostration
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
All
the
resolution
which
Father
Haydocke
had
displayed
in
his
interview
with
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
failed
him
now
,
and
he
yielded
to
the
agonies
of
despair
.
<EOS>
Father
Eastgate
was
in
little
better
condition
,
and
gave
vent
to
unavailing
lamentations
,
instead
of
paying
heed
to
the
consolatory
discourse
of
the
monk
who
had
been
permitted
to
visit
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
was
better
sustained
.
<EOS>
Though
greatly
enfeebled
by
the
occurrences
of
the
night
,
yet
in
proportion
as
his
bodily
strength
decreased
,
his
mental
energies
rallied
.
<EOS>
Since
the
confession
of
his
secret
offence
,
and
the
conviction
he
had
obtained
that
his
supposed
victim
still
lived
,
a
weight
seemed
taken
from
his
breast
,
and
he
had
no
longer
any
dread
of
death
.
<EOS>
Rather
he
looked
to
the
speedy
termination
of
existence
with
hopeful
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
prepared
himself
as
decently
as
the
means
afforded
him
permitted
for
his
last
appearance
before
the
world
,
but
refused
all
refreshment
except
a
cup
of
water
,
and
being
left
to
himself
was
praying
fervently
,
when
a
man
was
admitted
into
his
cell
.
<EOS>
Thinking
it
might
be
the
executioner
come
to
summon
him
,
he
arose
,
and
to
his
surprise
beheld
Hal
o
'
Nabs
.
<EOS>
The
countenance
of
the
rustic
was
pale
,
but
his
bearing
was
determined
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

,
my

,
"
cried
Paslew
.
<EOS>
"
I
hoped
you
had

<EOS>
"

cried

.
<EOS>
"
I

"
 
<EOS>
"
Yo'n

"
 
<EOS>
Paslew
would
have
sought
some
further
explanation
,
but
Hal
stepped
quickly
backwards
,
and
striking
his
foot
against
the
door
,
it
was
instantly
opened
by
the
guard
,
and
he
went
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Not
long
after
this
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
entered
the
great
hall
,
and
his
first
inquiry
was
as
to
the
safety
of
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
When
satisfied
of
this
,
he
looked
forth
,
and
shuddered
at
the
dismal
state
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
addressing
some
remarks
on
this
subject
,
and
on
its
interference
with
the
tragical
exhibition
about
to
take
place
,
an
officer
entered
the
hall
,
followed
by
several
persons
of
inferior
condition
,
amongst
whom
was
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
and
marched
up
to
the
earl
,
while
the
others
remained
standing
at
a
respectful
distance
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
news
do
you
bring
me
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
earl
,
noticing
the
officer
's
evident
uneasiness
of
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
hath
happened
to
the
prisoners
?
<EOS>
God
's
death
!
<EOS>
if
it
hath
,
you
shall
all
answer
for
it
with
your
bodies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
hath
happened
to
them
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
officer,--"but--
"
 
"
<EOS>
But
what
?
<EOS>
"
interrupted
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Out
with
it
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
executioner
from
Lancaster
and
his
two
aids
have
fled
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fled
!
"
exclaimed
the
earl
,
stamping
his
foot
with
rage
;
"
now
as
I
live
,
this
is
a
device
to
delay
the
execution
till
some
new
attempt
at
rescue
can
be
made
.
<EOS>
But
it
shall
fail
,
if
I
string
up
the
abbot
myself
.
<EOS>
Death
!
<EOS>
can
no
other
hangmen
be
found
?
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
a
surety
,
my
lord
;
but
all
have
an
aversion
to
the
office
,
and
hold
it
opprobrious
,
especially
to
put
churchmen
to
death
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Opprobrious
or
not
,
it
must
be
done
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
See
that
fitting
persons
are
provided
.
"
 
At
this
moment
Hal
o
'
Nabs
stepped
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'm
willing

'
ondertake

he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
bears't
<EOS>
him
a
grudge
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
good
fellow
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
laughing
at
the
rustic
's
uncouth
appearance
;
"
but
thou
seem'st
<EOS>
a
stout
fellow
,
and
one
not
likely
to
flinch
,
and
may
discharge
the
office
as
well
as
another
.
<EOS>
If
no
better
man
can
be
found
,
let
him
do
it
,
"
he
added
to
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
humbly
thonk
your
lortship
,
"
replied
Hal
,
inwardly
rejoicing
at
the
success
of
his
scheme
.
<EOS>
But
his
countenance
fell
when
he
perceived
Demdike
advance
from
behind
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
man
is
not
to
be
trusted
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Demdike
,
coming
forward
;
"
he
has
some
mischievous
design
in
making
the
request
.
<EOS>
So
far
from
bearing
enmity
to
the
abbot
,
it
was
he
who
assisted
him
in
his
attempt
to
escape
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
earl
,
"
is
this
a
new
trick
?
<EOS>
Bring
the
fellow
forward
,
that
I
may
examine
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Hal
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Instantly
divining
Demdike
's
purpose
,
and
seeing
his
chance
lost
,
he
mingled
with
the
lookers
-
on
,
who
covered
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
he
be
found
when
sought
for
by
the
guard
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
you
provide
a
substitute
quickly
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
earl
,
angrily
,
to
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
needless
to
take
further
trouble
,
<EOS>
my
lord
,
"
replied
Demdike
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
offer
myself
as
executioner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
!
"
exclaimed
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
heard
that
the
men
from
Lancaster
were
fled
,
I
instantly
knew
that
some
scheme
to
frustrate
the
ends
of
justice
was
on
foot
,
and
I
at
once
resolved
to
undertake
the
office
myself
rather
than
delay
or
risk
should
occur
.
<EOS>
What
this
man
's
aim
was
,
who
hath
just
offered
himself
,
I
partly
guess
,
but
it
hath
failed
;
and
if
your
lordship
will
intrust
the
matter
to
me
,
I
will
answer
that
no
further
impediment
shall
arise
,
but
that
the
sentence
shall
be
fully
carried
out
,
and
the
law
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Your
lordship
can
trust
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Be
it
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
on
the
stroke
of
nine
.
<EOS>
At
ten
,
let
all
be
in
readiness
to
set
out
for
Wiswall
Hall
.
<EOS>
The
rain
may
have
ceased
by
that
time
,
but
no
weather
must
stay
you
.
<EOS>
Go
forth
with
the
new
executioner
,
sir
,
"
he
added
to
the
officer
,
"
and
see
all
necessary
preparations
made
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
Demdike
bowed
,
and
departed
with
the
officer
,
the
earl
sat
down
with
his
retainers
to
break
his
fast
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IX.--WISWALL
HALL
.
  
<EOS>
Shortly
before
ten
o'clock
a
numerous
cortège
,
consisting
of
a
troop
of
horse
in
their
full
equipments
,
a
band
of
archers
with
their
bows
over
their
shoulders
,
and
a
long
train
of
barefoot
monks
,
who
had
been
permitted
to
attend
,
set
out
from
the
abbey
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
came
a
varlet
with
a
paper
mitre
on
his
head
,
and
a
lathen
crosier
in
his
hand
,
covered
with
a
surcoat
,
on
which
was
emblazoned
,
but
torn
and
reversed
,
the
arms
of
Paslew
;
argent
,
a
fess
between
three
mullets
,
sable
,
pierced
of
the
field
,
a
crescent
for
difference
.
<EOS>
After
him
came
another
varlet
bearing
a
banner
,
on
which
was
painted
a
grotesque
figure
in
a
half
-
military
,
half
-
monastic
garb
,
representing
the
"
Earl
of
Poverty
,
"
with
this
distich
beneath
it:--
           
Priest
and
warrior
--
rich
and
poor
,
          
He
shall
be
hanged
at
his
own
door
.
 
<EOS>
Next
followed
a
tumbrel
,
drawn
by
two
horses
,
in
which
sat
the
abbot
alone
,
the
two
other
prisoners
being
kept
back
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Then
came
Demdike
,
in
a
leathern
jerkin
and
blood
-
red
hose
,
fitting
closely
to
his
sinewy
limbs
,
and
wrapped
in
a
houppeland
of
the
same
colour
as
the
hose
,
with
a
coil
of
rope
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
He
walked
between
two
ill
-
favoured
personages
habited
in
black
,
whom
he
had
chosen
as
assistants
.
<EOS>
A
band
of
halberdiers
brought
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
The
procession
moved
slowly
along,--the
passing
-
bell
tolling
each
minute
,
and
a
muffled
drum
sounding
hollowly
at
intervals
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
before
the
procession
started
the
rain
ceased
,
but
the
air
felt
damp
and
chill
,
and
the
roads
were
inundated
.
<EOS>
Passing
out
at
the
north
-
eastern
gateway
,
the
gloomy
train
skirted
the
south
side
of
the
convent
church
,
and
went
on
in
the
direction
of
the
village
of
Whalley
.
<EOS>
When
near
the
east
end
of
the
holy
edifice
,
the
abbot
beheld
two
coffins
borne
along
,
and
,
<EOS>
on
inquiry
,
learnt
that
they
contained
the
bodies
of
Bess
Demdike
and
Cuthbert
Ashbead
,
who
were
about
to
be
interred
in
the
cemetery
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
his
eye
for
the
first
time
encountered
that
of
his
implacable
foe
,
and
he
then
discovered
that
he
was
to
serve
as
his
executioner
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
Paslew
felt
much
trouble
at
this
thought
,
but
the
feeling
quickly
passed
away
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
Whalley
,
every
door
was
found
closed
,
and
every
window
shut
;
so
that
the
spectacle
was
lost
upon
the
inhabitants
;
and
after
a
brief
halt
,
the
cavalcade
get
out
for
Wiswall
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
Sprung
from
an
ancient
family
residing
in
the
neighbourhood
Of
Whalley
<EOS>
,
Abbot
Paslew
was
the
second
son
of
Francis
Paslew
Of
Wiswall
Hall
,
a
great
gloomy
stone
mansion
,
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
south
-
western
side
of
Pendle
Hill
,
where
his
brother
Francis
still
resided
.
<EOS>
Of
a
cold
and
cautious
character
,
Francis
Paslew
,
second
of
the
name
,
held
aloof
from
the
insurrection
,
and
when
his
brother
was
arrested
he
wholly
abandoned
him
.
<EOS>
Still
the
owner
of
Wiswall
had
not
altogether
escaped
suspicion
,
and
it
was
probably
as
much
with
the
view
of
degrading
him
as
of
adding
to
the
abbot
's
punishment
,
that
the
latter
was
taken
to
the
hall
on
the
morning
of
his
execution
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
the
cortège
toiled
thither
through
roads
bad
in
the
best
of
seasons
,
but
now
,
since
the
heavy
rain
,
scarcely
passable
;
and
it
arrived
there
in
about
half
an
hour
,
and
drew
up
on
the
broad
green
lawn
.
<EOS>
Window
and
door
of
the
hall
were
closed
;
<EOS>
no
smoke
issued
from
the
heavy
pile
of
chimneys
;
and
to
all
outward
seeming
the
place
was
utterly
deserted
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
inquiries
,
it
appeared
that
Francis
Paslew
had
departed
for
Northumberland
on
the
previous
day
,
taking
all
his
household
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
earlier
years
,
a
quarrel
having
occurred
between
the
haughty
abbot
and
the
churlish
Francis
,
the
brothers
rarely
met
,
whence
it
chanced
that
John
Paslew
had
seldom
visited
the
place
of
his
birth
of
late
,
though
lying
so
near
to
the
abbey
,
and
,
indeed
,
forming
part
of
its
ancient
dependencies
.
<EOS>
It
was
sad
to
view
it
now
;
and
yet
<EOS>
the
house
,
gloomy
as
it
was
,
recalled
seasons
with
which
,
though
they
might
awaken
regret
,
no
guilty
associations
were
connected
.
<EOS>
Dark
was
the
hall
,
and
desolate
,
but
on
the
fine
old
trees
around
it
the
rooks
were
settling
,
and
their
loud
cawings
pleased
him
,
and
excited
gentle
emotions
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
he
grew
young
again
,
and
forgot
why
he
was
there
.
<EOS>
Fondly
surveying
the
house
,
the
terraced
garden
,
in
which
,
as
a
boy
,
he
had
so
often
strayed
,
and
the
park
beyond
it
,
where
he
had
chased
the
deer
;
his
gaze
rose
to
the
cloudy
heights
of
Pendle
,
springing
immediately
behind
the
mansion
,
and
up
which
he
had
frequently
climbed
.
<EOS>
The
flood
-
gates
of
memory
were
opened
at
once
,
and
a
whole
tide
of
long
-
buried
feelings
rushed
upon
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
half
-
painful
,
half
-
pleasurable
retrospect
he
was
aroused
by
the
loud
blast
of
a
trumpet
,
thrice
blown
.
<EOS>
A
recapitulation
of
his
offences
,
together
with
his
sentence
,
was
read
by
a
herald
,
after
which
the
reversed
blazonry
was
fastened
upon
the
door
of
the
hall
,
just
below
a
stone
escutcheon
on
which
was
carved
the
arms
of
the
family
;
while
the
paper
mitre
was
torn
and
trampled
under
foot
,
the
lathen
crosier
broken
in
twain
,
and
the
scurril
banner
hacked
in
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
degrading
act
was
performed
,
a
man
in
a
miller
's
white
garb
,
with
the
hood
drawn
over
his
face
,
forced
his
way
towards
the
tumbrel
,
and
while
the
attention
of
the
guard
was
otherwise
engaged
,
whispered
in
Paslew
's
ear
,
 
"
Ey
han
failed
<EOS>

'

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
wizard
has
a
charm
against
steel
,
my
son
,
and
indeed
is
proof
against
all
weapons
forged
by
men
,
"
replied
Paslew
,
who
recognised
the
voice
of
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
and
hoped
by
this
assertion
to
divert
him
from
his
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
say
yo
<EOS>
so
,
feythur
abbut
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Hal
.
"
<EOS>
Then
ey'n
reach
him
wi
'
summot
sacred
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
word
was
given
to
return
,
and
in
half
an
hour
the
cavalcade
arrived
at
the
abbey
in
the
same
order
<EOS>
it
had
left
it
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
rain
had
ceased
,
heavy
clouds
still
hung
overhead
,
threatening
another
deluge
,
and
the
aspect
of
the
abbey
remained
gloomy
as
ever
.
<EOS>
The
bell
continued
to
toll
;
drums
were
beaten
;
and
trumpets
sounded
from
the
outer
and
inner
gateway
,
and
from
the
three
quadrangles
.
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
drew
up
in
front
of
the
great
northern
entrance
;
and
its
return
being
announced
within
,
the
two
other
captives
were
brought
forth
,
each
fastened
upon
a
hurdle
,
harnessed
to
a
stout
horse
.
<EOS>
They
looked
dead
already
,
so
ghastly
was
the
hue
of
their
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
's
turn
came
next
.
<EOS>
Another
hurdle
was
brought
forward
,
and
Demdike
advanced
to
the
tumbrel
.
<EOS>
But
Paslew
recoiled
from
his
touch
,
and
sprang
to
the
ground
unaided
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
laid
on
his
back
upon
the
hurdle
,
and
his
hands
and
feet
were
bound
fast
with
ropes
to
the
twisted
timbers
.
<EOS>
While
this
painful
task
was
roughly
performed
by
the
wizard
's
two
ill
-
favoured
assistants
,
the
crowd
of
rustics
who
looked
on
,
murmured
and
exhibited
such
strong
tokens
of
displeasure
,
that
the
guard
thought
it
prudent
to
keep
them
off
with
their
halberts
.
<EOS>
But
when
all
was
done
,
Demdike
motioned
to
a
man
standing
behind
him
to
advance
,
and
the
person
who
was
wrapped
in
a
russet
cloak
complied
,
drew
forth
an
infant
,
and
held
it
in
such
way
that
the
abbot
could
see
it
.
<EOS>
Paslew
understood
what
was
meant
,
but
he
uttered
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
Demdike
then
knelt
down
beside
him
,
as
if
ascertaining
the
security
of
the
cords
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear:--
 
"
Recall
thy
malediction
,
and
my
dagger
shall
save
thee
from
the
last
indignity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
replied
Paslew
;
"
the
curse
is
irrevocable
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
recall
it
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
said
,
thy
child
shall
be
a
witch
,
and
the
mother
of
witches
--
but
all
shall
be
swept
off
--
all
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hell
's
torments
seize
thee
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
wizard
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
thou
hast
done
thy
worst
to
me
,
"
rejoined
Paslew
,
meekly
,
"
thou
canst
not
harm
me
beyond
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Look
to
thyself
,
for
even
as
thou
speakest
,
thy
child
is
taken
from
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
.
<EOS>
While
Demdike
knelt
beside
Paslew
,
a
hand
was
put
forth
,
and
,
before
the
man
who
had
custody
of
the
infant
could
prevent
it
,
his
little
charge
was
snatched
from
him
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
abbot
saw
,
though
the
wizard
perceived
it
not
.
<EOS>
The
latter
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
child
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
of
the
fellow
in
the
russet
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
taken
from
me
by
yon
tall
man
who
is
disappearing
through
the
gateway
,
"
replied
the
other
,
in
great
trepidation
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
_
he
_
here
!
"
exclaimed
Demdike
,
regarding
the
dark
figure
with
a
look
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
gone
from
me
for
ever
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
for
ever
!
"
echoed
the
abbot
,
solemnly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
revenge
is
still
left
me
--
revenge
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Demdike
,
with
an
infuriated
gesture
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
glut
thyself
with
it
speedily
,
"
replied
the
abbot
;
"
for
thy
time
here
is
short
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
if
it
be
,
"
replied
Demdike
;
"
I
shall
live
long
enough
if
I
survive
thee
.
"
    
CHAPTER
X.--THE
HOLEHOUSES
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
blast
of
a
trumpet
resounded
from
the
gateway
,
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
with
the
sheriff
on
his
right
hand
,
and
Assheton
on
the
left
,
and
mounted
on
a
richly
caparisoned
charger
,
rode
forth
.
<EOS>
He
was
preceded
by
four
javelin
-
men
,
and
followed
by
two
heralds
in
their
tabards
.
 
<EOS>
To
doleful
tolling
of
bells
--
to
solemn
music
--
to
plaintive
hymn
chanted
by
monks
--
to
roll
of
muffled
drum
at
intervals
--
the
sad
cortège
set
forth
.
<EOS>
Loud
cries
from
the
bystanders
marked
its
departure
,
and
some
of
them
followed
it
,
but
many
turned
away
,
unable
to
endure
the
sight
of
horror
about
to
ensue
.
<EOS>
Amongst
those
who
went
on
was
Hal
o
'
<EOS>
Nabs
,
but
he
took
care
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
guard
,
though
he
was
little
likely
to
be
recognised
,
owing
to
his
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
Despite
the
miserable
state
of
the
weather
,
a
great
multitude
was
assembled
at
the
place
of
execution
,
and
they
watched
the
approaching
cavalcade
with
moody
curiosity
.
<EOS>
To
prevent
disturbance
,
arquebussiers
were
stationed
in
parties
here
and
there
,
and
a
clear
course
for
the
cortège
was
preserved
by
two
lines
of
halberdiers
with
crossed
pikes
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
this
,
much
difficulty
was
experienced
in
mounting
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Rendered
slippery
by
the
wet
,
and
yet
more
so
by
the
trampling
of
the
crowd
,
the
road
was
so
bad
in
places
that
the
horses
could
scarcely
drag
the
hurdles
up
it
,
and
more
than
one
delay
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
stoppages
were
always
denounced
by
groans
,
yells
,
and
hootings
from
the
mob
,
and
these
neither
the
menaces
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
nor
the
active
measures
of
the
guard
,
could
repress
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
the
cavalcade
reached
its
destination
.
<EOS>
Then
the
crowd
struggled
forward
,
and
settled
into
a
dense
compact
ring
,
round
the
circular
railing
enclosing
the
place
of
execution
,
within
which
were
drawn
up
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
the
sheriff
,
Assheton
,
and
the
principal
gentlemen
,
together
with
Demdike
and
his
assistants
;
the
guard
forming
a
circle
three
deep
round
them
.
 
<EOS>
Paslew
was
first
unloosed
,
and
when
he
stood
up
,
he
found
Father
Smith
,
the
late
prior
,
beside
him
,
and
tenderly
embraced
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
of
good
courage
,
Father
Abbot
,
"
said
the
prior
;
"
a
few
moments
,
and
you
will
be
numbered
with
the
just
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
hope
is
in
the
infinite
mercy
of
Heaven
,
father
,
"
replied
Paslew
,
sighing
deeply
.
"
<EOS>
Pray
for
me
at
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Doubt
it
not
,
"
returned
the
prior
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
pray
for
you
now
and
ever
.
"
 
Meanwhile
,
the
bonds
of
the
two
other
captives
were
unfastened
,
but
they
were
found
wholly
unable
to
stand
without
support
.
<EOS>
A
lofty
ladder
had
been
placed
against
the
central
scaffold
,
and
up
this
Demdike
,
having
cast
off
his
houppeland
,
mounted
and
adjusted
the
rope
.
<EOS>
His
tall
gaunt
figure
,
fully
displayed
in
his
tight
-
fitting
red
garb
,
made
him
look
like
a
hideous
scarecrow
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
was
greeted
by
the
mob
with
a
perfect
hurricane
of
indignant
outcries
and
yells
.
<EOS>
But
he
heeded
them
not
,
but
calmly
pursued
his
task
.
<EOS>
Above
him
wheeled
the
two
ravens
,
who
had
never
quitted
the
place
since
daybreak
,
uttering
their
discordant
cries
.
<EOS>
When
all
was
done
,
he
descended
a
few
steps
,
and
,
taking
a
black
hood
from
his
girdle
to
place
over
the
head
of
his
victim
,
called
out
in
a
voice
which
had
little
human
in
its
tone
,
"
I
wait
for
you
,
John
Paslew
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
ready
,
Paslew
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
And
embracing
the
prior
for
the
last
time
,
he
added
,
"
_
Vale
,
carissime
frater
,
in
æternum
vale
!
<EOS>
et
Dominus
tecum
sit
in
ultionem
inimicorum
nostrorum
_
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
king
's
pleasure
that
you
say
not
a
word
in
your
justification
to
the
mob
,
Paslew
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
such
intention
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
abbot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
tarry
no
longer
,
"
said
the
earl
;
"
if
you
need
aid
you
shall
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
require
none
,
"
replied
Paslew
,
resolutely
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
mounted
the
ladder
,
with
as
much
firmness
and
dignity
as
if
ascending
the
steps
of
a
tribune
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
nothing
but
yells
and
angry
outcries
had
stunned
the
ears
of
the
lookers
-
on
,
and
several
missiles
had
been
hurled
at
Demdike
,
some
of
which
took
effect
,
though
without
occasioning
discomfiture
;
but
when
the
abbot
appeared
above
the
heads
of
the
guard
,
the
tumult
instantly
subsided
,
and
profound
silence
ensued
.
<EOS>
Not
a
breath
was
drawn
by
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
The
ravens
alone
continued
their
ominous
croaking
.
 
<EOS>
Hal
o
'
<EOS>
Nabs
,
who
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
the
ring
,
saw
thus
far
but
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
rushed
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
reached
the
level
ground
,
a
culverin
was
fired
from
the
gateway
,
and
the
next
moment
a
loud
wailing
cry
bursting
from
the
mob
told
that
the
abbot
was
launched
into
eternity
.
 
<EOS>
Hal
would
not
look
back
,
but
went
slowly
on
,
and
presently
afterwards
other
horrid
sounds
dinned
in
his
ears
,
telling
that
all
was
over
with
the
two
other
sufferers
.
<EOS>
Sickened
and
faint
,
he
leaned
against
a
wall
for
support
.
<EOS>
How
long
he
continued
thus
,
he
knew
not
,
but
he
heard
the
cavalcade
coming
down
the
hill
,
and
saw
the
Earl
of
Derby
and
his
attendants
ride
past
.
<EOS>
Glancing
toward
the
place
of
execution
,
Hal
then
perceived
that
the
abbot
had
been
cut
down
,
and
,
rousing
himself
,
he
joined
the
crowd
now
rushing
towards
the
gate
,
and
ascertained
that
the
body
of
Paslew
was
to
be
taken
to
the
convent
church
,
and
deposited
there
till
orders
were
to
be
given
respecting
its
interment
.
<EOS>
He
learnt
,
also
,
that
the
removal
of
the
corpse
was
intrusted
to
Demdike
.
<EOS>
Fired
by
this
intelligence
,
and
suddenly
conceiving
a
wild
project
of
vengeance
,
founded
upon
what
he
had
heard
from
the
abbot
of
the
wizard
being
proof
against
weapons
forged
by
men
,
he
hurried
to
the
church
,
entered
it
,
the
door
being
thrown
open
,
and
rushing
up
to
the
gallery
,
contrived
to
get
out
through
a
window
upon
the
top
of
the
porch
,
where
he
secreted
himself
behind
the
great
stone
statue
of
Saint
Gregory
.
 
<EOS>
The
information
he
had
obtained
proved
correct
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
a
mournful
train
approached
the
church
,
and
a
bier
was
set
down
before
the
porch
.
<EOS>
A
black
hood
covered
the
face
of
the
dead
,
but
the
vestments
showed
that
it
was
the
body
of
Paslew
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
the
bearers
was
Demdike
,
and
when
the
body
was
set
down
he
advanced
towards
it
,
and
,
removing
the
hood
,
gazed
at
the
livid
and
distorted
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
length
I
am
fully
avenged
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
Abbot
Paslew
,
also
,
"
cried
a
voice
above
him
.
 
<EOS>
Demdike
looked
up
,
but
the
look
was
his
last
,
for
the
ponderous
statue
of
Saint
Gregory
de
Northbury
,
launched
from
its
pedestal
,
fell
upon
his
head
,
and
crushed
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
A
mangled
and
breathless
mass
was
taken
from
beneath
the
image
,
and
the
hands
and
visage
of
Paslew
were
found
spotted
with
blood
dashed
from
the
gory
carcass
.
<EOS>
The
author
of
the
wizard
's
destruction
was
suspected
,
but
never
found
,
nor
was
it
positively
known
who
had
done
the
deed
till
years
after
,
when
Hal
o
'
Nabs
,
who
meanwhile
had
married
pretty
Dorothy
Croft
,
and
had
been
blessed
by
numerous
offspring
in
the
union
,
made
his
last
confession
,
and
then
he
exhibited
no
remarkable
or
becoming
penitence
for
the
act
,
neither
was
he
refused
absolution
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
abbot
and
his
enemy
perished
together
.
<EOS>
The
mutilated
remains
of
the
wizard
were
placed
in
a
shell
,
and
huddled
into
the
grave
where
his
wife
had
that
morning
been
laid
.
<EOS>
But
no
prayer
was
said
over
him
.
<EOS>
And
the
superstitious
believed
that
the
body
was
carried
off
that
very
night
by
the
Fiend
,
and
taken
to
a
witch
's
sabbath
in
the
ruined
tower
on
Rimington
Moor
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
was
,
that
the
unhallowed
grave
was
disturbed
.
<EOS>
The
body
of
Paslew
was
decently
interred
in
the
north
aisle
of
the
parish
church
of
Whalley
,
beneath
a
stone
with
a
Gothic
cross
sculptured
upon
it
,
and
bearing
the
piteous
inscription:--"_Miserere
mei
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
belief
of
the
vulgar
the
abbot
did
not
rest
tranquilly
.
<EOS>
For
many
years
afterwards
a
white
-
robed
monastic
figure
was
seen
to
flit
along
the
cloisters
,
pass
out
at
the
gate
,
and
disappear
with
a
wailing
cry
over
the
Holehouses
.
<EOS>
And
the
same
ghostly
figure
was
often
seen
to
glide
through
the
corridor
in
the
abbot
's
lodging
,
and
vanish
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
leading
to
the
little
oratory
.
<EOS>
Thus
Whalley
Abbey
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
,
and
few
liked
to
wander
through
its
deserted
cloisters
,
or
ruined
church
,
after
dark
.
<EOS>
The
abbot
's
tragical
end
was
thus
recorded:--
            
<EOS>
Johannes
Paslew
:
Capitali
Effectus
Supplicio
.
          
<EOS>
12º
Mensis
Martii
,

.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
infant
,
upon
whom
the
abbot
's
malediction
fell
,
it
was
reserved
for
the
dark
destinies
shadowed
forth
in
the
dread
anathema
he
had
uttered
:
to
the
development
of
which
the
tragic
drama
about
to
follow
is
devoted
,
and
to
which
the
fate
of
Abbot
Paslew
forms
a
necessary
and
fitting
prologue
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
the
veil
of
the
Future
may
be
drawn
aside
.
<EOS>
That
infant
and
her
progeny
became

CHAPTER
I.--THE
MAY
QUEEN
.
  
<EOS>
On
a
May
-
day
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
,
and
a
most
lovely
May
-
day
,
too
,
admirably
adapted
to
usher
in
the
merriest
month
of
the
year
,
and
seemingly
made
expressly
for
the
occasion
,
a
wake
was
held
at
Whalley
,
to
which
all
the
neighbouring
country
folk
resorted
,
and
indeed
many
of
the
gentry
as
well
,
for
in
the
good
old
times
,
when
England
was
still
merry
England
,
a
wake
had
attractions
for
all
classes
alike
,
and
especially
in
Lancashire
;
for
,
with
pride
I
speak
it
,
there
were
no
lads
who
,
in
running
,
vaulting
,
wrestling
,
dancing
,
or
in
any
other
manly
exercise
,
could
compare
with
the
Lancashire
lads
.
<EOS>
In
archery
,
above
all
,
none
could
match
them
;
for
were
not
their
ancestors
the
stout
bowmen
and
billmen
whose
cloth
-
yard
shafts
,
and
trenchant
weapons
,
won
the
day
at
Flodden
?
<EOS>
And
were
they
not
true
sons
of
their
fathers
?
<EOS>
And
then
,
I
speak
it
with
yet
greater
pride
<EOS>
,
there
were
few
,
if
any
,
lasses
who
could
compare
in
comeliness
with
the
rosy
-
cheeked
,
dark
-
haired
,
bright
-
eyed
lasses
of
Lancashire
.
 
<EOS>
Assemblages
of
this
kind
,
therefore
,
where
the
best
specimens
of
either
sex
were
to
be
met
with
,
were
sure
to
be
well
attended
,
and
in
spite
of
an
enactment
passed
in
the
preceding
reign
of
Elizabeth
,
prohibiting
"
piping
,
playing
,
bear
-
baiting
,
and
bull
-
baiting
on
the
Sabbath
-
days
,
or
on
any
other
days
,
and
also
superstitious
ringing
of
bells
,
wakes
,
and
common
feasts
,
"
they
were
not
only
not
interfered
with
,
but
rather
encouraged
by
the
higher
orders
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
well
known
that
the
reigning
monarch
,
James
the
First
,
inclined
the
other
way
,
and
,
desirous
of
checking
the
growing
spirit
of
Puritanism
throughout
the
kingdom
,
had
openly
expressed
himself
in
favour
of
honest
recreation
after
evening
prayers
and
upon
holidays
;
and
,
furthermore
,
had
declared
that
he
liked
well
the
spirit
of
his
good
subjects
in
Lancashire
,
and
would
not
see
them
punished
for
indulging
in
lawful
exercises
,
but
that
ere
long
he
would
pay
them
a
visit
in
one
of
his
progresses
,
and
judge
for
himself
,
and
if
he
found
all
things
as
they
had
been
represented
to
him
,
he
would
grant
them
still
further
licence
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
this
expression
of
the
royal
opinion
removed
every
restriction
,
and
old
sports
and
pastimes
,
May
-
games
,
Whitsun
-
ales
,
and
morris
-
dances
,
with
rush
-
bearings
,
bell
-
ringings
,
wakes
,
and
feasts
,
were
as
much
practised
as
before
the
passing
of
the
obnoxious
enactment
of
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
The
Puritans
and
Precisians
discountenanced
them
,
it
is
true
,
as
much
as
ever
,
and
would
have
put
them
down
,
if
they
could
,
as
savouring
of
papistry
and
idolatry
,
and
some
rigid
divines
thundered
against
them
from
the
pulpit
;
but
with
the
king
and
the
authorities
in
their
favour
,
the
people
little
heeded
these
denunciations
against
them
,
and
abstained
not
from
any
"
honest
recreation
"
whenever
a
holiday
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
If
Lancashire
was
famous
for
wakes
,
the
wakes
of
Whalley
were
famous
even
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
The
men
of
the
district
were
in
general
a
hardy
,
handsome
race
,
of
the
genuine
Saxon
breed
,
and
passionately
fond
of
all
kinds
of
pastime
,
and
the
women
had
their
full
share
of
the
beauty
indigenous
to
the
soil
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
a
secluded
spot
,
in
the
heart
of
a
wild
mountainous
region
,
and
though
occasionally
visited
by
travellers
journeying
northward
,
or
by
others
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
,
retained
a
primitive
simplicity
of
manners
,
and
a
great
partiality
for
old
customs
and
habits
.
 
<EOS>
The
natural
beauties
of
the
place
,
contrasted
with
the
dreary
region
around
it
,
and
heightened
by
the
picturesque
ruins
of
the
ancient
abbey
,
part
of
which
,
namely
,
the
old
abbot
's
lodgings
,
had
been
converted
into
a
residence
by
the
Asshetons
,
and
was
now
occupied
by
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
while
the
other
was
left
to
the
ravages
of
time
,
made
it
always
an
object
of
attraction
to
those
residing
near
it
;
but
when
on
the
May
-
day
in
question
,
there
was
not
only
to
be
a
wake
,
but
<EOS>
a
May
-
pole
set
on
the
green
,
and
a
rush
-
bearing
with
morris
-
dancers
besides
,
together
with
Whitsun
-
ale
at
the
abbey
,
crowds
flocked
to
Whalley
from
Wiswall
,
Cold
Coates
,
and
Clithero
,
from
Ribchester
and
Blackburn
,
from
Padiham
and
Pendle
,
and
even
from
places
more
remote
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
John
Lawe
's
of
the
Dragon
full
,
but
the
Chequers
,
and
the
Swan
also
,
and
the
roadside
alehouse
to
boot
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
had
several
guests
at
the
abbey
,
and
others
were
expected
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
while
Doctor
Ormerod
had
friends
staying
with
him
at
the
vicarage
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
midnight
,
on
the
morning
of
the
festival
,
many
young
persons
of
the
village
,
of
both
sexes
,
had
arisen
,
and
,
to
the
sound
of
horn
,
had
repaired
to
the
neighbouring
woods
,
and
there
gathered
a
vast
stock
of
green
boughs
and
flowering
branches
of
the
sweetly
-
perfumed
hawthorn
,
wild
roses
,
and
honeysuckle
,
with
baskets
of
violets
,
cowslips
,
primroses
,
blue
-
bells
,
and
other
wild
flowers
,
and
returning
in
the
same
order
they
went
forth
,
fashioned
the
branches
into
green
bowers
within
the
churchyard
,
or
round
about
the
May
-
pole
set
up
on
the
green
,
and
decorated
them
afterwards
with
garlands
and
crowns
of
flowers
.
<EOS>
This
morning
ceremonial
ought
to
have
been
performed
without
wetting
the
feet
:
<EOS>
but
though
some
pains
were
taken
in
the
matter
,
few
could
achieve
the
difficult
task
,
except
those
carried
over
the
dewy
grass
by
their
lusty
swains
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
before
the
rushes
had
been
gathered
,
and
the
rush
cart
piled
,
shaped
,
trimmed
,
and
adorned
by
those
experienced
in
the
task
,
(
and
it
was
one
requiring
both
taste
and
skill
,
as
will
be
seen
when
the
cart
itself
shall
come
forth
,
)
while
others
had
borrowed
for
its
adornment
,
from
the
abbey
and
elsewhere
,
silver
tankards
,
drinking
-
cups
,
spoons
,
ladles
,
brooches
,
watches
,
chains
,
and
bracelets
,
so
as
to
make
an
imposing
show
.
 
<EOS>
Day
was
ushered
in
by
a
merry
peal
of
bells
from
the
tower
of
the
old
parish
church
,
and
the
ringers
practised
all
kinds
of
joyous
changes
during
the
morning
,
and
fired
many
a
clanging
volley
.
<EOS>
The
whole
village
was
early
astir
;
and
as
these
were
times
when
good
hours
were
kept
;
and
as
early
rising
is
a
famous
sharpener
of
the
appetite
,
especially
when
attended
with
exercise
,
so
an
hour
before
noon
the
rustics
one
and
all
sat
down
to
dinner
,
the
strangers
being
entertained
by
their
friends
,
and
if
they
had
no
friends
,
throwing
themselves
upon
the
general
hospitality
.
<EOS>
The
alehouses
were
reserved
for
tippling
at
a
later
hour
,
for
it
was
then
customary
for
both
gentleman
and
commoner
,
male
as
well
as
female
,
as
will
be
more
fully
shown
hereafter
,
to
take
their
meals
at
home
,
and
repair
afterwards
to
houses
of
public
entertainment
for
wine
or
other
liquors
.
<EOS>
Private
chambers
were
,
of
course
,
reserved
for
the
gentry
;
but
not
unfrequently
the
squire
and
his
friends
would
take
their
bottle
with
the
other
guests
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
invariable
practice
in
the
northern
counties
in
the
reign
of
James
the
First
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
mid
-
day
,
and
when
the
bells
began
to
peal
merrily
again
(
for
even
ringers
must
recruit
themselves
)
,
at
a
small
cottage
in
the
outskirts
of
the
village
,
and
close
to
the
Calder
,
whose
waters
swept
past
the
trimly
kept
garden
attached
to
it
,
two
young
girls
were
employed
in
attiring
a
third
,
who
was
to
represent
Maid
Marian
,
or
Queen
of
May
,
in
the
pageant
then
about
to
ensue
.
<EOS>
And
,
certainly
,
by
sovereign
and
prescriptive
right
of
beauty
,
no
one
better
deserved
the
high
title
and
distinction
conferred
upon
her
than
this
fair
girl
.
<EOS>
Lovelier
maiden
in
the
whole
county
,
and
however
high
her
degree
,
than
this
rustic
damsel
<EOS>
,
it
was
impossible
to
find
;
and
though
the
becoming
and
fanciful
costume
in
which
she
was
decked
could
not
heighten
her
natural
charms
,
it
certainly
displayed
them
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
Upon
her
smooth
and
beautiful
brow
sat
a
gilt
crown
,
while
her
dark
and
luxuriant
hair
,
covered
behind
with
a
scarlet
coif
,
embroidered
with
gold
;
and
tied
with
yellow
,
white
,
and
crimson
ribands
,
but
otherwise
wholly
unconfirmed
,
swept
down
almost
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Slight
and
fragile
,
her
figure
was
of
such
just
proportion
that
every
movement
and
gesture
had
an
indescribable
charm
.
<EOS>
The
most
courtly
dame
might
have
envied
her
fine
and
taper
fingers
,
and
fancied
she
could
improve
them
by
protecting
them
against
the
sun
,
or
by
rendering
them
snowy
white
with
paste
or
cosmetic
,
but
this
was
questionable
;
nothing
certainly
could
improve
the
small
foot
and
finely
-
turned
ankle
,
so
well
displayed
in
the
red
hose
and
smart
little
yellow
buskin
,
fringed
with
gold
.
<EOS>
A
stomacher
of
scarlet
cloth
,
braided
with
yellow
lace
in
cross
bars
,
confined
her
slender
waist
.
<EOS>
Her
robe
was
of
carnation
-
coloured
silk
,
with
wide
sleeves
,
and
the
gold
-
fringed
skirt
descended
only
a
little
below
the
knee
,
like
the
dress
of
a
modern
Swiss
peasant
,
so
as
to
reveal
the
exquisite
symmetry
of
her
limbs
.
<EOS>
Over
all
she
wore
a
surcoat
of
azure
silk
,
lined
with
white
,
and
edged
with
gold
.
<EOS>
In
her
left
hand
she
held
a
red
pink
as
an
emblem
of
the
season
.
<EOS>
So
enchanting
was
her
appearance
altogether
,
so
fresh
the
character
of
her
beauty
,
so
bright
the
bloom
that
dyed
her
lovely
checks
,
that
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
personification
of
May
herself
.
<EOS>
She
was
indeed
in
the
very
May
of
life
--
the
mingling
of
spring
and
summer
in
womanhood
;
and
the
tender
blue
eyes
,
bright
and
clear
as
diamonds
of
purest
water
,
the
soft
regular
features
,
and
the
merry
mouth
,
whose
ruddy
parted
lips
ever
and
<EOS>
anon
displayed
two
rows
of
pearls
,
completed
the
similitude
to
the
attributes
of
the
jocund
month
.
 
<EOS>
Her
handmaidens
,
both
of
whom
were
simple
girls
,
and
though
not
destitute
of
some
pretensions
to
beauty
themselves
,
in
nowise
to
be
compared
with
her
,
were
at
the
moment
employed
in
knotting
the
ribands
in
her
hair
,
and
adjusting
the
azure
surcoat
.
 
<EOS>
Attentively
watching
these
proceedings
sat
on
a
stool
,
placed
in
a
corner
,
a
little
girl
,
some
nine
or
ten
years
old
,
with
a
basket
of
flowers
on
her
knee
.
<EOS>
The
child
was
very
diminutive
,
even
for
her
age
,
and
her
smallness
was
increased
by
personal
deformity
,
occasioned
by
contraction
of
the
chest
,
and
spinal
curvature
,
which
raised
her
back
above
her
shoulders
;
but
her
features
were
sharp
and
cunning
,
indeed
almost
malignant
,
and
there
was
a
singular
and
unpleasant
look
about
the
eyes
,
which
were
not
placed
evenly
in
the
head
.
<EOS>
Altogether
she
had
a
strange
old
-
fashioned
look
,
and
from
her
habitual
bitterness
of
speech
,
as
well
as
from
her
vindictive
character
,
which
,
young
as
she
was
,
had
been
displayed
,
with
some
effect
,
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
she
was
no
great
favourite
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
curious
now
to
watch
<EOS>
the
eager
and
envious
interest
she
took
in
the
progress
of
her
sister
's
adornment
--
for
such
was
the
degree
of
relationship
in
which
she
stood
to
the
May
Queen
--
and
when
the
surcoat
was
finally
adjusted
,
and
the
last
riband
tied
,
she
broke
forth
,
having
hitherto
preserved
a
sullen
silence
.

Alizon

by

the

in
which

disposed
to
indulge--"so

Jennet

words
,
"

"
she
added
,
shaking
her
thin
fingers

armed
with
talon

like

threateningly
at

,
"

"
 
<EOS>
At
the
mention
of
this
name
a
sudden
shade
came
over
Susan
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
Changing
colour
,
and
slightly
trembling
,
she
turned
away
from
the
child
,
who
,
noticing
the
effect
of
her
threat
,
could
not
repress
her
triumph
.
<EOS>
But
again
Alizon
interposed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do

Susan

"
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
my

I

indeed

she
will
never

and
do
not

what

Jennet

for
she

Alizon

taking

<EOS>
"

Jennet

<EOS>
You

"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'm

"
rejoined
the
little
girl
,
laughing
;
"

<EOS>
It

"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
didna

sobbed
Susan
,
"
boh

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Weel

replied
the

;
"
boh
let
it
be
a
lesson
to

,
to

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It

"
replied
Susan
,
drying
her

.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
door
opened
,
and
a
woman
entered
from
an
inner
room
,
having
a
high
-
crowned
,
conical
-
shaped
hat
on
her
head
,
and
broad
white
pinners
over
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
of
dark
red
camlet
,
with
high
-
heeled
shoes
.
<EOS>
She
stooped
slightly
,
and
being
rather
lame
,
supported
herself
on
a
crutch
-
handled
stick
.
<EOS>
In
age
she
might
be
between
forty
and
fifty
,
but
she
looked
much
older
,
and
her
features
were
not
at
all
prepossessing
from
a
hooked
nose
and
chin
,
while
their
sinister
effect
was
increased
by
a
formation
of
the
eyes
similar
to
that
in
Jennet
,
only
more
strongly
noticeable
in
her
case
.
<EOS>
This
woman
was
Elizabeth
Device
,
widow
of
John
Device
,
about
whose
death
there
was
a
mystery
to
be
inquired
into
hereafter
,
and
mother
of
Alizon
and
Jennet
,
though
how
she
came
to
have
a
daughter
so
unlike
herself
in
all
respects
as
the
former
,
no
one
could
conceive
;
but
so
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
"
Soh
,
ye
ha
donned
your
finery
at
last
,
Alizon
,
"
said
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
brother
Jem
has
just
run
up
to
say
that
t

that
Robin
Hood
and
his
merry
men

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
their
Queen
is
quite
ready
for
them
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
moving
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neigh

a
look
at

cried
Elizabeth
,
staying
her
;

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
queen
of
a
day
,
mother
;
a
queen
of
a
little
village
festival
;
nothing
more
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
I
were
a
queen
in
right
earnest
,
or
even
a
great
lady--
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whot
would
yo
do

"
demanded
Elizabeth
Device
,
sourly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
make
you
rich
,
mother
,
and
build
you
a
grand
house
to
live
in
,
"
replied
Alizon
;
"
much
grander
than
Browsholme
,
or
Downham
,
or
Middleton
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pity
yo're
nah

replied
Elizabeth
,
relaxing
her
harsh
features
into
a
wintry
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whot
would
ye
do
fo
me
,
Alizon
,
if
ye
were
a
queen
?
<EOS>
"
asked
little
Jennet
,
looking
up
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
let
me
see
,
"
was
the
reply
;
"
I
'd
indulge
every
one
of
your
whims
and
wishes
.
<EOS>
You
should
only
need
ask
to
have
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
--
poh
--
yo'd
never

"
observed
Elizabeth
,
testily
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
nah
your
way
to
try
an
content

,
mother
,
even
whon
ye
might

"
rejoined
Jennet
,
who
,
if
she
loved
few
people
,
loved
her
mother
least
of
all
,
and
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
testifying
her
dislike
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Awt

cried
her
mother
;

"
interposed
Susan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
n't
thought
about
myself
,
"
replied
the
other
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
con
tell
ye
<EOS>
what
she
'd
do
,
Suky
,
"
replied
little
Jennet
,
knowingly
;
"
she
'd
marry
Master
Richard
Assheton
,
o
'
Middleton
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jennet
!
"
exclaimed
Alizon
,
blushing
crimson
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
true
,
"
replied
the
little
girl
;
<EOS>
"
ye
knoa
ye
would
,
Alizon
,
Look
at
her
feace
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
screaming
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
d
te
tongue
,
little
plague
,
"
cried
Elizabeth
,
rapping
her
knuckles
with
her
stick
,
"
and
behave
thyself
,
or
theaw
shanna
go
out
to
t
'
wake
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jennet
dealt
her
mother
a
bitterly
vindictive
look
,
but
she
neither
uttered
cry
,
nor
made
remark
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
momentary
silence
that
ensued
the
blithe
jingling
of
bells
was
heard
,
accompanied
by
the
merry
sound
of
tabor
and
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
here
come
the
rush
-
cart
and
the
morris
-
dancers
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
rushing
joyously
to
the
window
,
which
,
being
left
partly
open
,
admitted
the
scent
of
the
woodbine
and
eglantine
by
which
it
was
overgrown
,
as
well
as
the
humming
sound
of
the
bees
by
which
the
flowers
were
invaded
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
immediately
afterwards
a
frolic
troop
,
like
a
band
of
masquers
,
approached
the
cottage
,
and
drew
up
before
it
,
while
the
jingling
of
bells
ceasing
at
the
same
moment
,
told
that
the
rush
-
cart
had
stopped
likewise
.
<EOS>
Chief
amongst
the
party
was
Robin
Hood
clad
in
a
suit
of
Lincoln
green
,
with
a
sheaf
of
arrows
at
his
back
,
a
bugle
dangling
from
his
baldric
,
a
bow
in
his
hand
,
and
a
broad
-
leaved
green
hat
on
his
head
,
looped
up
on
one
side
,
and
decorated
with
a
heron
's
feather
.
<EOS>
The
hero
of
Sherwood
was
personated
by
a
tall
,
well
-
limbed
fellow
,
to
whom
,
being
really
a
forester
of
Bowland
,
the
character
was
natural
.
<EOS>
Beside
him
stood
a
very
different
figure
,
a
jovial
friar
,
with
shaven
crown
,
rubicund
cheeks
,
bull
throat
,
and
mighty
paunch
,
covered
by
a
russet
habit
,
and
girded
in
by
a
red
cord
,
decorated
with
golden
twist
and
tassel
.
<EOS>
He
wore
red
hose
and
sandal
shoon
,
and
carried
in
his
girdle
a
Wallet
,
to
contain
a
roast
capon
,
a
neat
's
tongue
,
or
any
other
dainty
given
him
.
<EOS>
Friar
Tuck
,
for
such
he
was
,
found
his
representative
in
Ned
Huddlestone
,
porter
at
the
abbey
,
who
,
as
the
largest
and
stoutest
man
in
the
village
,
was
chosen
on
that
account
to
the
part
.
<EOS>
Next
to
him
came
a
character
of
no
little
importance
,
and
upon
whom
much
of
the
mirth
of
the
pageant
depended
,
and
this
devolved
upon
the
village
cobbler
,
Jack
Roby
,
a
dapper
little
fellow
,
who
fitted
the
part
of
the
Fool
to
a
nicety
.
<EOS>
With
bauble
in
hand
,
and
blue
coxcomb
hood
adorned
with
long
white
asses
'
ears
on
head
,
with
jerkin
of
green
,
striped
with
yellow
;
hose
of
different
colours
,
the
left
leg
being
yellow
,
with
a
red
pantoufle
,
and
the
right
blue
,
terminated
with
a
yellow
shoe
;
with
bells
hung
upon
various
parts
of
his
motley
attire
,
so
that
he
could
not
move
without
producing
a
jingling
sound
,
Jack
Roby
looked
wonderful
indeed
;
and
was
constantly
dancing
about
,
and
dealing
a
blow
with
his
bauble
.
<EOS>
Next
came
<EOS>
Will
Scarlet
,
Stukely
,
and
Little
John
,
all
proper
men
and
tall
,
attired
in
Lincoln
green
,
like
Robin
Hood
,
and
similarly
equipped
.
<EOS>
Like
him
,
too
,
they
were
all
foresters
of
Bowland
,
owning
service
to
the
bow
-
bearer
,
Mr.
Parker
of
Browsholme
hall
;
and
the
representative
of
Little
John
,
who
was
six
feet
and
a
half
high
,
and
stout
in
proportion
,
was
Lawrence
Blackrod
,
Mr.
Parker
's
head
keeper
.
<EOS>
After
the
foresters
came
Tom
the
Piper
,
a
wandering
minstrel
,
habited
for
the
occasion
in
a
blue
doublet
,
with
sleeves
of
the
same
colour
,
turned
up
with
yellow
,
red
hose
,
and
brown
buskins
,
red
bonnet
,
and
green
surcoat
lined
with
yellow
.
<EOS>
Beside
the
piper
was
another
minstrel
,
similarly
attired
,
and
provided
with
a
tabor
.
<EOS>
Lastly
came
one
of
the
main
features
of
the
pageant
,
and
which
,
together
with
the
Fool
,
contributed
most
materially
to
the
amusement
of
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
Hobby
-
horse
.
<EOS>
The
hue
of
this
,
spirited
charger
was
a
pinkish
white
,
and
his
housings
were
of
crimson
cloth
hanging
to
the
ground
,
so
as
to
conceal
the
rider
's
real
legs
,
though
a
pair
of
sham
ones
dangled
at
the
side
.
<EOS>
His
bit
was
of
gold
,
and
his
bridle
red
morocco
leather
,
while
his
rider
was
very
sumptuously
arrayed
in
a
purple
mantle
,
bordered
with
gold
,
with
a
rich
cap
of
the
same
regal
hue
on
his
head
,
encircled
with
gold
,
and
having
a
red
feather
stuck
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
hobby
-
horse
had
a
plume
of
nodding
feathers
on
his
head
,
and
careered
from
side
to
side
,
now
rearing
in
front
,
now
kicking
behind
,
now
prancing
,
now
gently
ambling
,
and
in
short
indulging
in
playful
fancies
and
vagaries
,
such
as
horse
never
indulged
in
before
,
to
the
imminent
danger
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
,
of
his
rider
,
and
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
beholders
.
<EOS>
Nor
must
it
be
omitted
,
as
it
was
matter
of
great
wonderment
to
the
lookers
-
on
,
that
by
some
legerdemain
contrivance
the
rider
of
the
hobby
-
horse
had
a
couple
of
daggers
stuck
in
his
cheeks
,
while
from
his
steed
's
bridle
hung
a
silver
ladle
,
which
he
held
now
and
then
to
the
crowd
,
and
in
which
,
when
he
did
so
,
a
few
coins
were
sure
to
rattle
.
<EOS>
After
the
hobby
-
horse
came
the
May
-
pole
,
not
the
tall
pole
so
called
and
which
was
already
planted
in
the
green
,
but
a
stout
staff
elevated
some
six
feet
above
the
head
of
the
bearer
,
with
a
coronal
of
flowers
atop
,
and
four
long
garlands
hanging
down
,
each
held
by
a
morris
-
dancer
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
May
Queen
's
gentleman
usher
,
a
fantastic
personage
in
habiliments
of
blue
guarded
with
white
,
and
holding
a
long
willow
wand
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
After
the
usher
came
the
main
troop
of
morris
-
dancers
--
the
men
attired
in
a
graceful
costume
,
which
set
off
their
light
active
figures
to
advantage
,
consisting
of
a
slashed
-
jerkin
of
black
and
white
velvet
,
with
cut
sleeves
left
open
so
as
to
reveal
the
snowy
shirt
beneath
,
white
hose
,
and
shoes
of
black
Spanish
leather
with
large
roses
.
<EOS>
Ribands
were
every
where
in
their
dresses
--
ribands
and
tinsel
adorned
their
caps
,
ribands
crossed
their
hose
,
and
ribands
were
tied
round
their
arms
.
<EOS>
In
either
hand
they
held
a
long
white
handkerchief
knotted
with
ribands
.
<EOS>
The
female
morris
-
dancers
were
habited
in
white
,
decorated
like
the
dresses
of
the
men
;
they
had
ribands
and
wreaths
of
flowers
round
their
heads
,
bows
in
their
hair
,
and
in
their
hands
long
white
knotted
kerchiefs
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
rear
of
the
performers
in
the
pageant
came
the
rush
-
cart
drawn
by
a
team
of
eight
stout
horses
,
with
their
manes
and
tails
tied
with
ribands
,
their
collars
fringed
with
red
and
yellow
worsted
,
and
hung
with
bells
,
which
jingled
blithely
at
every
movement
,
and
their
heads
decked
with
flowers
.
<EOS>
The
cart
itself
consisted
of
an
enormous
pile
of
rushes
,
banded
and
twisted
together
,
rising
to
a
considerable
height
,
and
terminated
in
a
sharp
ridge
,
like
the
point
of
a
Gothic
window
.
<EOS>
The
sides
and
top
were
decorated
with
flowers
and
ribands
,
and
there
were
eaves
in
front
and
at
the
back
,
and
on
the
space
within
them
,
which
was
covered
with
white
paper
,
were
strings
of
gaudy
flowers
,
embedded
in
moss
,
amongst
which
were
suspended
all
the
ornaments
and
finery
that
could
be
collected
for
the
occasion
:
to
wit
,
flagons
of
silver
,
spoons
,
ladles
,
chains
,
watches
,
and
bracelets
,
so
as
to
make
a
brave
and
resplendent
show
.
<EOS>
The
wonder
was
how
articles
of
so
much
value
would
be
trusted
forth
on
such
an
occasion
;
but
nothing
was
ever
lost
.
<EOS>
On
the
top
of
the
rush
-
cart
,
and
bestriding
its
sharp
ridges
,
sat
half
a
dozen
men
,
habited
somewhat
like
the
morris
-
dancers
,
in
garments
bedecked
with
tinsel
and
ribands
,
holding
garlands
formed
by
hoops
,
decorated
with
flowers
,
and
attached
to
poles
ornamented
with
silver
paper
,
cut
into
various
figures
and
devices
,
and
diminishing
gradually
in
size
as
they
rose
to
a
point
,
where
they
were
crowned
with
wreaths
of
daffodils
.
 
<EOS>
A
large
crowd
of
rustics
,
of
all
ages
,
accompanied
the
morris
-
dancers
and
rush
-
cart
.
 
<EOS>
This
gay
troop
having
come
to
a
halt
,
as
described
,
before
the
cottage
,
the
gentleman
-
usher
entered
it
,
and
,
tapping
against
the
inner
door
with
his
wand
,
took
off
his
cap
as
soon
as
it
was
opened
,
and
bowing
deferentially
to
the
ground
,
said
he
was
come
to
invite
the
Queen
of
May
to
join
the
pageant
,
and
that
it
only
awaited
her
presence
to
proceed
to
the
green
.
<EOS>
Having
delivered
this
speech
in
as
good
set
phrase
as
he
could
command
,
and
being
the
parish
clerk
and
schoolmaster
to
boot
,
Sampson
Harrop
by
name
,
he
was
somewhat
more
polished
than
the
rest
of
the
hinds
;
and
having
,
moreover
,
received
a
gracious
response
from
the
May
Queen
,
who
condescendingly
replied
that
she
was
quite
ready
to
accompany
him
,
he
took
her
hand
,
and
led
her
ceremoniously
to
the
door
,
whither
they
were
followed
by
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
Loud
was
the
shout
that
greeted
Alizon
's
appearance
,
and
tremendous
was
the
pushing
to
obtain
a
sight
of
her
;
and
so
much
was
she
abashed
by
the
enthusiastic
greeting
,
which
was
wholly
unexpected
on
her
part
,
that
she
would
have
drawn
back
again
,
if
it
had
been
possible
;
but
the
usher
led
her
forward
,
and
Robin
Hood
and
the
foresters
having
bent
the
knee
before
her
,
the
hobby
-
horse
began
to
curvet
anew
among
the
spectators
,
and
tread
on
their
toes
,
the
fool
to
rap
their
knuckles
with
his
bauble
,
the
piper
to
play
,
the
taborer
to
beat
his
tambourine
,
and
the
morris
-
dancers
to
toss
their
kerchiefs
over
their
heads
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
pageant
being
put
in
motion
,
the
rush
-
cart
began
to
roll
on
,
its
horses
'
bells
jingling
merrily
,
and
the
spectators
cheering
lustily
.

CHAPTER
II.--THE
BLACK
CAT
AND
THE
WHITE
DOVE
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Jennet
watched
her
sister
's
triumphant
departure
with
a
look
in
which
there
was
far
more
of
envy
than
sympathy
,
and
,
when
her
mother
took
her
hand
to
lead
her
forth
,
she
would
not
go
,
but
saying
she
did
not
care
for
any
such
idle
sights
,
went
back
sullenly
to
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
When
there
,
however
,
she
could
not
help
peeping
through
the
window
,
and
saw
Susan
and
Nancy
join
the
revel
rout
,
with
feelings
of
increased
bitterness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
wish
it
would
rain
an
spile
their
finery
,
"
she
said
,
sitting
down
on
her
stool
,
and
plucking
the
flowers
from
her
basket
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
yet
,
why
canna
ey
enjoy
such
seets
like
other
folk
?
<EOS>
Truth
is
,
ey've
nah
heart
for
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Folks
say
,
"
she
continued
,
after
a
pause
,
"
that
grandmother
Demdike
is
a
witch
,
an
con
do
<EOS>
os
she
pleases
.
<EOS>
Ey
wonder
if
she
made
Alizon
so
protty
.
<EOS>
Nah
,
that
canna
be
,
fo
'
Alizon
's
na
favourite
o
'
hern
.
<EOS>
If
she
loves
onny
one
it
's
me
.
<EOS>
Why
dunna
she
make
me
good
-
looking
,
then
?
<EOS>
They
say
it
's
sinfu
'
to
be
a
witch
--
<EOS>
if
so
,
how
comes
grandmother
Demdike
to
be
one
?
<EOS>
Boh
ey'n
observed
that
those
folks
os
caws
her
witch
are
afeard
on
her
,
so
it
may
be
pure
spite
<EOS>
o
'
their
pert
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
thus
mused
,
a
great
black
cat
belonging
to
her
mother
,
which
had
followed
her
into
the
room
,
rubbed
himself
against
her
,
putting
up
his
back
,
and
purring
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Tib
,
"
said
the
little
girl
,
<EOS>
"
how
are
ye
,
Tib
?
<EOS>
Ey
didna
knoa
ye
were
here
.
<EOS>
Lemme
ask
ye
some
questions
,
Tib
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
cat
mewed
,
looked
up
,
and
fixed
his
great
yellow
eyes
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
'
ud
think
ye
onderstud
whot
wos
said
to
ye
,
Tib
,
"
<EOS>
pursued
little
Jennet
.
"
<EOS>
We'n
see
whot
ye
say
to
this
!
<EOS>
Shan
ey
ever
be
<EOS>
Queen
o
'
<EOS>
May
,
like
sister
Alizon
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
cat
mewed
in
a
manner
that
the
little
girl
found
no
difficulty
in
interpreting
the
reply
into
"
No
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
's
that
,
Tib
?
"
cried
Jennet
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
If
ey
thought
ye
meant
it
,
ey'd
beat
ye
,
sirrah
.
<EOS>
Answer
me
another
question
,
ye
saucy
knave
.
<EOS>
Who
will
be
luckiest
,
Alizon
or
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
This
time
the
cat
darted
away
from
her
,
and
made
two
or
three
skirmishes
round
the
room
,
as
if
gone
suddenly
mad
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
con
may
nowt
o
<EOS>
'
that
,
"
observed
Jennet
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
the
cat
bounded
upon
the
chimney
board
,
over
which
was
placed
a
sampler
,
worked
with
the
name
"
ALIZON
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
Tib
really
seems
to
onderstond
me
,
ey
declare
,
"
observed
Jennet
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
Ey
should
like
to
ask
him
a
few
more
questions
,
if
ey
durst
,
"
she
added
,
regarding
with
some
distrust
the
animal
,
who
now
returned
,
and
began
rubbing
against
her
as
before
.
<EOS>
"
Tib
--
Tib
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
cat
looked
up
,
and
mewed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Protty
Tib
--
sweet
Tib
,
"
continued
the
little
girl
,
coaxingly
.
"
<EOS>
Whot
mun
one
do
to
be
a
witch
like
grandmother
Demdike
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
cat
again
dashed
twice
or
thrice
madly
round
the
room
,
and
then
stopping
suddenly
at
the
hearth
,
sprang
up
the
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'n
frightened
ye
away
ot
onny
rate
,
"
observed
Jennet
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
it
may
mean
summot
,
"
she
added
,
reflecting
a
little
,
"
fo
ey'n
heerd
say
os
how
witches
fly
up
chimleys
o
'
broomsticks
to
attend
their
sabbaths
.
<EOS>
Ey
should
like
to
fly
i
'
that
manner
,
an
change
myself
into
another
shape
--
<EOS>
onny
shape
<EOS>
boh
my

.
<EOS>
Oh
that
ey
could
be
os
protty
os
Alizon
!
<EOS>
Ey
dunna
knoa
whot
<EOS>
ey'd
nah
do
to
be
like
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
Again
the
great
black
cat
was
beside
her
,
rubbing
against
her
,
and
purring
.
<EOS>
The
child
was
a
good
deal
startled
,
for
she
had
not
seen
him
return
,
and
the
door
was
shut
,
though
he
might
have
come
in
through
the
open
window
,
only
she
had
been
looking
that
way
all
the
time
,
and
had
never
noticed
him
.
<EOS>
Strange
!
 
<EOS>
"
Tib
,
"
said
the
child
,
patting
him
,
"
thou
hasna
answered
my
last
question
<EOS>
--
how
is
one
to
become
a
witch
?
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
made
this
inquiry
the
cat
suddenly
scratched
her
in
the
arm
,
so
that
the
blood
came
.
<EOS>
The
little
girl
was
a
good
deal
frightened
,
as
well
as
hurt
,
and
,
withdrawing
her
arm
quickly
,
made
a
motion
of
striking
the
animal
.
<EOS>
But
starting
backwards
,
erecting
his
tail
,
and
spitting
,
the
cat
assumed
such
a
formidable
appearance
,
that
she
did
not
dare
to
touch
him
,
and
she
then
perceived
that
some
drops
of
blood
stained
her
white
sleeve
,
giving
the
spots
a
certain
resemblance
to
the
letters
J.
and
D.
,
her
own
initials
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
when
she
was
about
to
scream
for
help
,
though
she
knew
no
one
was
in
the
house
,
all
having
gone
away
with
the
May
-
day
revellers
,
a
small
white
dove
flew
in
at
the
open
window
,
and
skimming
round
the
room
,
alighted
near
her
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
the
cat
caught
sight
of
this
beautiful
bird
,
than
instead
of
preparing
to
pounce
upon
it
,
as
might
have
been
expected
,
he
instantly
abandoned
his
fierce
attitude
,
and
,
uttering
a
sort
of
howl
,
sprang
up
the
chimney
as
before
.
<EOS>
But
the
child
scarcely
observed
this
,
her
attention
being
directed
towards
the
bird
,
whose
extreme
beauty
delighted
her
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
quite
tame
too
,
and
allowed
itself
to
be
touched
,
and
even
drawn
towards
her
,
without
an
effort
to
escape
.
<EOS>
Never
,
surely
,
was
seen
so
beautiful
a
bird
--
with
such
milkwhite
feathers
,
such
red
legs
,
and
such
pretty
yellow
eyes
,
with
crimson
circles
round
them
!
<EOS>
So
thought
the
little
girl
,
as
she
gazed
at
it
,
and
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
gentle
and
good
thoughts
came
upon
her
,
and
she
reflected
what
a
nice
present
this
pretty
bird
would
make
to
her
sister
Alizon
on
her
return
from
the
merry
-
making
,
and
how
pleased
she
should
feel
to
give
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
thought
of
Alizon
's
constant
kindness
to
her
,
and
half
reproached
herself
with
the
poor
return
she
made
for
it
,
wondering
she
could
entertain
any
feelings
of
envy
towards
one
so
good
and
amiable
.
<EOS>
All
this
while
the
dove
nestled
in
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
While
thus
pondering
,
the
little
girl
felt
an
unaccountable
drowsiness
steal
over
her
,
and
presently
afterwards
dropped
asleep
,
when
she
had
a
very
strange
dream
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
a
contest
going
on
between
two
spirits
,
a
good
one
and
a
bad,--the
bad
one
being
represented
by
the
great
black
cat
,
and
the
good
spirit
by
the
white
dove
.
<EOS>
What
they
were
striving
about
she
could
not
exactly
tell
,
but
she
felt
that
the
conflict
had
some
relation
to
herself
.
<EOS>
The
dove
at
first
appeared
to
have
but
a
poor
chance
against
the
claws
of
its
sable
adversary
,
but
the
sharp
talons
of
the
latter
made
no
impression
upon
the
white
plumage
of
the
bird
,
which
now
shone
like
silver
armour
,
and
in
the
end
the
cat
fled
,
yelling
as
it
darted
off--"Thou
art
victorious
now
,
but
her
soul
shall
yet
be
mine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Something
awakened
the
little
sleeper
at
the
same
moment
,
and
she
felt
very
much
terrified
at
her
dream
,
as
she
could
not
help
thinking
her
own
soul
might
be
the
one
in
jeopardy
,
and
her
first
impulse
was
to
see
whether
the
white
dove
was
safe
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
it
was
still
nestling
in
her
bosom
,
with
its
head
under
its
wing
.
 
<EOS>
Just
then
she
was
startled
at
hearing
her
own
name
pronounced
by
a
hoarse
voice
,
and
,
looking
up
,
she
beheld
a
tall
young
man
standing
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
somewhat
gipsy
look
,
having
a
dark
olive
complexion
,
and
fine
black
eyes
,
though
set
strangely
in
his
head
,
like
those
of
Jennet
and
her
mother
,
coal
black
hair
,
and
very
prominent
features
,
of
a
sullen
and
almost
savage
cast
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
gaunt
but
very
muscular
,
his
arms
being
extremely
long
and
<EOS>
his
hands
unusually
large
and
bony
--
personal
advantages
which
made
him
a
formidable
antagonist
in
any
rustic
encounter
,
and
in
such
he
was
frequently
engaged
,
<EOS>
being
of
a
very
irascible
temper
,
and
turbulent
disposition
.
<EOS>
He
was
clad
in
a
holiday
suit
of
dark
-
green
serge
,
which
fitted
him
well
,
and
carried
a
nosegay
in
one
hand
,
and
a
stout
blackthorn
cudgel
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
This
young
man
was
James
Device
,
son
of
Elizabeth
,
and
some
four
or
five
years
older
than
Alizon
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
live
with
his
mother
in
Whalley
,
but
in
Pendle
Forest
,
near
his
old
relative
,
Mother
Demdike
,
and
had
come
over
that
morning
to
attend
the
wake
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whot
are
ye
abowt
,
Jennet
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
James
Device
,
in
tones
naturally
hoarse
and
deep
,
and
which
he
took
as
little
pains
to
soften
,
as
he
did
to
polish
his
manners
,
which
were
more
than
ordinarily
rude
and
churlish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whot

he
repeated
,

"

her

"

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
came
out
,
she
found
her
brother
whistling
the
blithe
air
of
"
Green
Sleeves
,
"
cutting
strange
capers
,
in
imitation
of
the
morris
-
dancers
,
and
whirling
his
cudgel
over
his
head
instead
of
a
kerchief
.
<EOS>
The
gaiety
of
the
day
seemed
infectious
,
and
to
have
seized
even
him
.
<EOS>
People
stared
to
see
Black
Jem
,
or
Surly
Jem
,
as
he
was
indifferently
called
,
so
joyous
,
and
wondered
what
it
could
mean
.
<EOS>
He
then
fell
to
singing
a
snatch
of
a
local
ballad
at
that
time
in
vogue
in
the
neighbourhood:--
            
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If

"
 
<EOS>
"
Cum

"
he
cried
stopping
suddenly
in
his
song
,
and
snatching
his
sister
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
What

"
 
<EOS>
"
A
white
dove
,
"
replied
Jennet
,
determined
not
to
tell
him
any
thing
about
her
strange
dream
.
 
<EOS>
"
A

"
echoed
Jem
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

blandly
,
"

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
"
Nah

said
Jennet
,
pressing
the
bird
gently
to
her
bosom
,
"
neaw

.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Cum

"
cried
Jem
,
rather
testily
,
and
mending
his
pace
,
"
or

<EOS>
fo

<EOS>
Whoy

"
he
added
,
noticing
the
red
spots
on
her
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
Han

<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
,
evasively
.
<EOS>
"
Oh

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tib

"
echoed
Jem
,
gravely
,
and
glancing
uneasily
at
the
marks
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
on
quitting
the
cottage
,
the
May
-
day
revellers
had
proceeded
slowly
towards
the
green
,
increasing
the
number
of
their
followers
at
each
little
tenement
they
passed
,
and
being
welcomed
every
where
with
shouts
and
cheers
.
<EOS>
The
hobby
-
horse
curveted
and
capered
;
the
Fool
fleered
at
the
girls
,
and
flouted
the
men
,
jesting
with
every
one
,
and
when
failing
in
a
point
rapping
the
knuckles
of
his
auditors
;
Friar
Tuck
chucked
the
pretty
girls
under
the
chin
,
in
defiance
of
their
sweethearts
,
and
stole
a
kiss
from
every
buxom
dame
that
stood
in
his
way
,
and
then
snapped
his
fingers
,
or
made
a
broad
grimace
at
the
husband
;
the
piper
played
,
and
the
taborer
rattled
his
tambourine
;
the
morris
-
dancers
tossed
their
kerchiefs
aloft
;
and
the
bells
of
the
rush
-
cart
jingled
merrily
;
the
men
on
the
top
being
on
a
level
with
the
roofs
of
the
cottages
,
and
the
summits
of
the
haystacks
they
passed
,
but
in
spite
of
their
exalted
position
jesting
with
the
crowd
below
.
<EOS>
But
in
spite
of
these
multiplied
attractions
,
and
in
spite
of
the
gambols
of
Fool
and
Horse
,
though
the
latter
elicited
prodigious
laughter
,
the
main
attention
was
fixed
on
the
May
Queen
,
who
tripped
lightly
along
by
the
side
of
her
faithful
squire
,
Robin
Hood
,
followed
by
the
three
bold
foresters
of
Sherwood
,
and
her
usher
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
reached
the
green
,
where
already
a
large
crowd
was
collected
to
see
them
,
and
where
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
above
the
heads
of
the
assemblage
,
rose
the
lofty
May
-
pole
,
with
all
its
flowery
garlands
glittering
in
the
sunshine
,
and
its
ribands
fluttering
in
the
breeze
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
was
it
to
see
those
cheerful
groups
,
composed
of
happy
rustics
,
youths
in
their
holiday
attire
,
and
maidens
neatly
habited
too
,
and
fresh
and
bright
as
the
day
itself
.
<EOS>
Summer
sunshine
sparkled
in
their
eyes
,
and
weather
and
circumstance
as
well
as
genial
natures
disposed
them
to
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Every
lass
above
eighteen
had
her
sweetheart
,
and
old
couples
nodded
and
smiled
at
each
other
when
any
tender
speech
,
broadly
conveyed
but
tenderly
conceived
,
reached
their
ears
,
and
said
it
recalled
the
days
of
their
youth
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
was
it
to
hear
such
honest
laughter
,
and
such
good
homely
jests
.
 
<EOS>
Laugh
on
,
my
merry
lads
,
you
are
made
of
good
old
English
stuff
,
loyal
to
church
and
king
,
and
while
you
,
and
such
as
you
,
last
,
our
land
will
be
in
no
danger
from
foreign
foe
!
<EOS>
Laugh
on
,
and
praise
your
sweethearts
how
you
will
.
<EOS>
Laugh
on
,
and
blessings
on
your
honest
hearts
!
 
<EOS>
The
frolic
train
had
just
reached
the
precincts
of
the
green
,
when
the
usher
waving
his
wand
aloft
,
called
a
momentary
halt
,
announcing
that
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
and
the
gentry
were
coming
forth
from
the
Abbey
gate
to
meet
them
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
III.--THE
ASSHETONS
.
  
<EOS>
Between
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
of
the
Abbey
and
the
inhabitants
of
Whalley
,
many
of
whom
were
his
tenants
,
he
being
joint
lord
of
the
manor
with
John
Braddyll
of
Portfield
,
the
best
possible
feeling
subsisted
;
for
though
somewhat
austere
in
manner
,
and
tinctured
with
Puritanism
,
the
worthy
knight
was
sufficiently
shrewd
,
or
,
more
correctly
speaking
,
<EOS>
sufficiently
liberal
-
minded
,
to
be
tolerant
of
the
opinions
of
others
,
and
being
moreover
sincere
in
his
own
religious
views
,
no
man
could
call
him
in
question
for
them
;
besides
which
,
he
was
very
hospitable
to
his
friends
,
very
bountiful
to
the
poor
,
a
good
landlord
,
and
a
humane
man
.
<EOS>
His
very
austerity
of
manner
,
tempered
by
stately
courtesy
,
added
to
the
respect
he
inspired
,
especially
as
he
could
now
and
then
relax
into
gaiety
,
and
,
when
he
did
so
,
his
smile
was
accounted
singularly
sweet
.
<EOS>
But
in
general
he
was
grave
and
formal
;
stiff
in
attire
,
and
stiff
in
gait
;
cold
and
punctilious
in
manner
,
precise
in
speech
,
and
exacting
in
due
respect
from
both
high
and
low
,
which
was
seldom
,
if
ever
,
refused
him
.
<EOS>
Amongst
Sir
Ralph
's
other
good
qualities
,
for
such
it
was
esteemed
by
his
friends
and
retainers
,
and
they
were
,
of
course
,
the
best
judges
,
was
a
strong
love
of
the
chase
,
and
perhaps
he
indulged
a
little
too
freely
in
the
sports
of
the
field
,
for
a
gentleman
of
a
character
so
staid
and
decorous
;
but
his
popularity
was
far
from
being
diminished
by
the
circumstance
;
neither
did
he
suffer
the
rude
and
boisterous
companionship
into
which
he
was
brought
by
indulgence
in
this
his
favourite
pursuit
in
any
way
to
affect
him
.
<EOS>
Though
still
young
,
Sir
Ralph
was
prematurely
grey
,
and
this
,
combined
with
the
sad
severity
of
his
aspect
,
gave
him
the
air
of
one
considerably
past
the
middle
term
of
life
,
though
this
appearance
was
contradicted
again
by
the
youthful
fire
of
his
eagle
eye
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
handsome
and
strongly
marked
,
and
he
wore
a
pointed
beard
and
mustaches
,
with
a
shaved
cheek
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
had
married
twice
,
his
first
wife
being
a
daughter
of
Sir
James
Bellingham
of
Levens
,
in
Northumberland
,
by
whom
he
had
two
children
;
while
his
second
choice
fell
upon
Eleanor
Shuttleworth
,
the
lovely
and
well
-
endowed
heiress
of
Gawthorpe
,
to
whom
he
had
been
recently
united
.
<EOS>
In
his
attire
,
even
when
habited
for
the
chase
or
a
merry
-
making
,
like
the
present
,
the
Knight
of
Whalley
affected
a
sombre
colour
,
and
ordinarily
wore
a
quilted
doublet
of
black
silk
,
immense
trunk
hose
of
the
same
material
,
stiffened
with
whalebone
,
puffed
out
well
-
wadded
sleeves
,
falling
bands
,
for
he
eschewed
the
ruff
as
savouring
of
vanity
,
boots
of
black
flexible
leather
,
ascending
to
the
hose
,
and
armed
with
spurs
with
gigantic
rowels
,
a
round
-
crowned
small
-
brimmed
black
hat
,
with
an
ostrich
feather
placed
in
the
side
and
hanging
over
the
top
,
a
long
rapier
on
his
hip
,
and
a
dagger
in
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
This
buckram
attire
,
it
will
be
easily
conceived
,
contributed
no
little
to
the
natural
stiffness
of
his
thin
tall
figure
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
was
great
grandson
of
Richard
Assheton
,
who
flourished
in
the
time
of
Abbot
Paslew
,
and
who
,
in
conjunction
with
John
Braddyll
,
fourteen
years
after
the
unfortunate
prelate
's
attainder
and
the
dissolution
of
the
monastery
,
had
purchased
the
abbey
and
domains
of
Whalley
from
the
Crown
,
subsequently
to
which
,
a
division
of
the
property
so
granted
took
place
between
them
,
<EOS>
the
abbey
and
part
of
the
manor
falling
to
the
share
of
Richard
Assheton
,
whose
descendants
had
now
for
three
generations
made
it
their
residence
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
whole
of
Whalley
belonged
to
the
families
of
Assheton
and
Braddyll
,
which
had
intermarried
;
the
latter
,
as
has
been
stated
,
dwelling
at
Portfield
,
a
fine
old
seat
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
different
person
from
Sir
Ralph
was
his
cousin
,
Nicholas
Assheton
of
Downham
,
who
,
except
as
regards
his
Puritanism
,
might
be
considered
a
type
of
the
Lancashire
squire
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
A
precisian
in
religious
notions
,
and
constant
in
attendance
at
church
and
lecture
,
he
put
no
sort
of
restraint
upon
himself
,
but
mixed
up
fox
-
hunting
,
otter
-
hunting
,
shooting
at
the
mark
,
and
perhaps
shooting
with
the
long
-
bow
,
foot
-
racing
,
horse
-
racing
,
and
,
in
fact
,
every
other
kind
of
country
diversion
,
not
forgetting
tippling
,
cards
,
and
dicing
,
with
daily
devotion
,
discourses
,
and
psalm
-
singing
in
the
oddest
way
imaginable
.
<EOS>
A
thorough
sportsman
was
Squire
Nicholas
Assheton
,
well
versed
in
all
the
arts
and
mysteries
of
hawking
and
hunting
.
<EOS>
Not
a
man
in
the
county
could
ride
harder
,
hunt
deer
,
unkennel
fox
,
unearth
badger
,
or
spear
otter
,
better
than
he
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
to
tippling
,
he
would
sit
you
a
whole
afternoon
at
the
alehouse
,
and
be
the
merriest
man
there
,
and
drink
a
bout
with
every
farmer
present
.
<EOS>
And
if
the
parson
chanced
to
be
out
of
hearing
,
he
would
never
make
a
mouth
at
a
round
oath
,
nor
choose
a
second
expression
when
the
first
would
serve
his
turn
.
<EOS>
Then
,
who
so
constant
at
church
or
lecture
as
Squire
Nicholas
--
though
he
did
snore
sometimes
during
the
long
sermons
of
his
cousin
,
the
Rector
of
Middleton
?
<EOS>
A
great
man
was
he
at
all
weddings
,
christenings
,
churchings
,
and
funerals
,
and
never
neglected
his
bottle
at
these
ceremonies
,
nor
any
sport
in
doors
or
out
of
doors
,
meanwhile
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
such
a
roystering
Puritan
was
never
known
.
<EOS>
A
good
-
looking
young
man
was
the
Squire
of
Downham
,
possessed
of
a
very
athletic
frame
,
and
a
most
vigorous
constitution
,
which
helped
him
,
together
with
the
prodigious
exercise
he
took
,
through
any
excess
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
sanguine
complexion
,
with
a
broad
,
good
-
natured
visage
,
which
he
could
lengthen
at
will
in
a
surprising
manner
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
cropped
close
to
his
head
,
and
the
razor
did
daily
duty
over
his
cheek
and
chin
,
giving
him
the
roundhead
look
,
some
years
later
,
characteristic
of
the
Puritanical
party
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
had
taken
to
wife
Dorothy
,
daughter
of
Richard
Greenacres
of
Worston
,
and
was
most
fortunate
in
his
choice
,
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
his
lady
,
for
I
can
not
uphold
the
squire
as
a
model
of
conjugal
fidelity
.
<EOS>
Report
affirmed
that
he
loved
more
than
one
pretty
girl
under
the
rose
.
<EOS>
Squire
Nicholas
was
not
particular
as
to
the
quality
or
make
of
his
clothes
,
provided
they
wore
well
and
protected
him
against
the
weather
,
and
was
generally
to
be
seen
in
doublet
and
hose
of
stout
fustian
,
which
had
seen
some
service
,
with
a
broad
-
leaved
hat
,
originally
green
,
but
of
late
bleached
to
a
much
lighter
colour
;
but
he
was
clad
on
this
particular
occasion
in
ash
-
coloured
habiliments
fresh
from
the
tailor
's
hands
,
with
buff
boots
drawn
up
to
the
knee
,
and
a
new
round
hat
from
York
with
a
green
feather
in
it
.
<EOS>
His
legs
were
slightly
embowed
,
and
he
bore
himself
like
a
man
rarely
out
of
the
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
Downham
,
the
residence
of
the
squire
,
was
a
fine
old
house
,
very
charmingly
situated
to
the
north
of
Pendle
Hill
,
of
which
it
commanded
a
magnificent
view
,
and
a
few
miles
from
Clithero
.
<EOS>
The
grounds
about
it
were
well
-
wooded
and
beautifully
broken
and
diversified
,
watered
by
the
Ribble
,
and
opening
upon
the
lovely
and
extensive
valley
deriving
its
name
from
that
stream
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
in
good
order
and
well
maintained
,
and
the
stables
plentifully
furnished
with
horses
,
while
the
hall
was
adorned
with
various
trophies
and
implements
of
the
chase
;
but
as
I
propose
paying
its
owner
a
visit
,
I
shall
defer
any
further
description
of
the
place
till
an
opportunity
arrives
for
examining
it
in
detail
.
 
<EOS>
A
third
cousin
of
Sir
Ralph
's
,
though
in
the
second
degree
,
likewise
present
on
the
May
-
day
in
question
,
was
the
Reverend
Abdias
Assheton
,
Rector
of
Middleton
,
a
very
worthy
man
,
who
,
though
differing
from
his
kinsmen
upon
some
religious
points
,
and
not
altogether
approving
of
the
conduct
of
one
of
them
,
was
on
good
terms
with
both
.
<EOS>
The
Rector
of
Middleton
was
portly
and
middle
-
aged
,
fond
of
ease
and
reading
,
and
by
no
means
indifferent
to
the
good
things
of
life
.
<EOS>
He
was
unmarried
,
and
passed
much
of
his
time
at
Middleton
Hall
,
the
seat
of
his
near
relative
Sir
Richard
Assheton
,
to
whose
family
he
was
greatly
attached
,
and
whose
residence
closely
adjoined
the
rectory
.
 
<EOS>
A
fourth
cousin
,
also
present
,
was
young
Richard
Assheton
of
Middleton
,
eldest
son
and
heir
of
the
owner
of
that
estate
.
<EOS>
Possessed
of
all
the
good
qualities
largely
distributed
among
his
kinsmen
,
with
none
of
their
drawbacks
,
this
young
man
was
as
tolerant
and
bountiful
as
Sir
Ralph
,
without
his
austerity
and
sectarianism
;
as
keen
a
sportsman
and
as
bold
a
rider
as
Nicholas
,
without
his
propensities
to
excess
;
as
studious
,
at
times
,
and
as
well
read
as
Abdias
,
without
his
laziness
and
self
-
indulgence
;
and
as
courtly
and
well
-
bred
as
his
father
,
Sir
Richard
,
who
was
esteemed
one
of
the
most
perfect
gentlemen
in
the
county
,
without
his
haughtiness
.
<EOS>
Then
he
was
the
handsomest
of
his
race
,
though
the
Asshetons
were
accounted
the
handsomest
family
in
Lancashire
,
and
no
one
minded
yielding
the
palm
to
young
Richard
,
even
if
it
could
be
contested
,
he
was
so
modest
and
unassuming
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
Richard
Assheton
was
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
,
tall
,
gracefully
and
slightly
formed
,
but
possessed
of
such
remarkable
vigour
,
that
even
his
cousin
Nicholas
could
scarcely
compete
with
him
in
athletic
exercises
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
fine
and
regular
,
with
an
almost
Phrygian
precision
of
outline
;
his
hair
was
of
a
dark
brown
,
and
fell
in
clustering
curls
over
his
brow
and
neck
;
and
his
complexion
was
fresh
and
blooming
,
and
set
off
by
a
slight
beard
and
mustache
,
carefully
trimmed
and
pointed
.
<EOS>
His
dress
consisted
of
a
dark
-
green
doublet
,
with
wide
velvet
hose
,
embroidered
and
fringed
,
descending
nearly
to
the
knee
,
where
they
were
tied
with
points
and
ribands
,
met
by
dark
stockings
,
and
terminated
by
red
velvet
shoes
with
roses
in
them
.
<EOS>
A
white
feather
adorned
his
black
broad
-
leaved
hat
,
and
he
had
a
rapier
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
Amongst
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
's
guests
were
Richard
Greenacres
,
of
Worston
,
Nicholas
Assheton
's
father
-
in
-
law
;
Richard
Sherborne
of
Dunnow
,
near
Sladeburne
,
who
had
married
Dorothy
,
Nicholas
's
sister
;
Mistress
Robinson
of
Raydale
House
,
aunt
to
the
knight
and
the
squire
,
and
two
of
her
sons
,
both
stout
youths
,
with
John
Braddyll
and
his
wife
,
of
Portfield
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
there
was
Master
Roger
Nowell
,
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
county
,
and
a
very
active
and
busy
one
too
,
who
had
been
invited
for
an
especial
purpose
,
to
be
explained
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Head
of
an
ancient
Lancashire
family
,
residing
at
Read
,
a
fine
old
hall
,
some
little
distance
from
Whalley
,
Roger
Nowell
,
though
a
worthy
,
well
-
meaning
man
,
dealt
hard
measure
from
the
bench
,
and
seldom
tempered
justice
with
mercy
.
<EOS>
He
was
sharp
-
featured
,
dry
,
and
sarcastic
,
and
being
adverse
to
country
sports
,
his
presence
on
the
occasion
was
the
only
thing
likely
to
impose
restraint
on
the
revellers
.
<EOS>
Other
guests
there
were
,
but
none
of
particular
note
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
of
the
party
consisted
of
Lady
Assheton
,
Mistress
Nicholas
Assheton
of
Downham
,
Dorothy
Assheton
of
Middleton
,
sister
to
Richard
,
a
lovely
girl
of
eighteen
,
with
light
fleecy
hair
,
summer
blue
eyes
,
and
a
complexion
of
exquisite
purity
,
Mistress
Sherborne
of
Dunnow
,
Mistress
Robinson
of
Raydale
,
and
Mistress
Braddyll
of
Portfield
,
before
mentioned
,
together
with
the
wives
and
daughters
of
some
others
of
the
neighbouring
gentry
;
most
noticeable
amongst
whom
was
Mistress
Alice
Nutter
of
Rough
Lee
,
in
Pendle
Forest
,
a
widow
lady
and
a
relative
of
the
Assheton
family
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
might
be
a
year
or
two
turned
of
forty
,
but
she
still
retained
a
very
fine
figure
,
and
much
beauty
of
feature
,
though
of
a
cold
and
disagreeable
cast
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
mourning
,
though
her
husband
had
been
dead
several
years
,
and
her
rich
dark
habiliments
well
became
her
pale
complexion
and
raven
hair
.
<EOS>
A
proud
poor
gentleman
was
Richard
Nutter
,
her
late
husband
,
and
his
scanty
means
not
enabling
him
to
keep
up
as
large
an
establishment
as
he
desired
,
or
to
be
as
hospitable
as
his
nature
prompted
,
his
temper
became
soured
,
and
he
visited
his
ill
humours
upon
his
wife
,
who
,
devotedly
attached
to
him
,
to
all
outward
appearance
at
least
,
never
resented
his
ill
treatment
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
and
without
any
previous
symptoms
of
ailment
,
or
apparent
cause
,
unless
it
might
be
over
-
fatigue
in
hunting
the
day
before
,
Richard
Nutter
was
seized
with
a
strange
and
violent
illness
,
which
,
after
three
or
four
days
of
acute
suffering
,
brought
him
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
During
his
illness
he
was
constantly
and
zealously
tended
by
his
wife
,
but
he
displayed
great
aversion
to
her
,
declaring
himself
bewitched
,
and
that
an
old
woman
was
ever
in
the
corner
of
his
room
mumbling
wicked
enchantments
against
him
.
<EOS>
But
as
no
such
old
woman
could
be
seen
,
these
assertions
were
treated
as
delirious
ravings
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
,
however
,
forgotten
after
his
death
,
and
some
people
said
that
he
had
certainly
been
bewitched
,
and
that
a
waxen
image
made
in
his
likeness
,
and
stuck
full
of
pins
,
had
been
picked
up
in
his
chamber
by
Mistress
Alice
and
cast
into
the
fire
,
and
as
soon
as
it
melted
he
had
expired
.
<EOS>
Such
tales
only
obtained
credence
with
the
common
folk
;
but
as
Pendle
Forest
was
a
sort
of
weird
region
,
many
reputed
witches
dwelling
in
it
,
they
were
the
more
readily
believed
,
even
by
those
who
acquitted
Mistress
Nutter
of
all
share
in
the
dark
transaction
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
gave
the
best
proof
that
she
respected
her
husband
's
memory
by
not
marrying
again
,
and
she
continued
to
lead
a
very
secluded
life
at
Rough
Lee
,
a
lonesome
house
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
She
lived
quite
by
herself
,
for
she
had
no
children
,
her
only
daughter
having
perished
somewhat
strangely
when
quite
an
infant
.
<EOS>
Though
a
relative
of
the
Asshetons
,
she
kept
up
little
intimacy
with
them
,
and
it
was
a
matter
of
surprise
to
all
that
she
had
been
drawn
from
her
seclusion
to
attend
the
present
revel
.
<EOS>
Her
motive
,
however
,
in
visiting
the
Abbey
,
was
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
in
settling
a
dispute
between
her
and
Roger
Nowell
,
relative
to
the
boundary
line
of
part
of
their
properties
which
came
together
;
and
this
was
the
reason
why
the
magistrate
had
been
invited
to
Whalley
.
<EOS>
After
hearing
both
sides
of
the
question
,
and
examining
plans
of
the
estates
,
which
he
knew
to
be
accurate
,
Sir
Ralph
,
who
had
been
appointed
umpire
,
pronounced
a
decision
in
favour
of
Roger
Nowell
,
but
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
refusing
to
abide
by
it
,
the
settlement
of
the
matter
was
postponed
till
the
day
but
one
following
,
between
which
time
the
landmarks
were
to
be
investigated
by
a
certain
little
lawyer
named
Potts
,
who
attended
on
behalf
of
Roger
Nowell
;
together
with
Nicholas
and
Richard
Assheton
,
on
behalf
of
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
Upon
their
evidence
it
was
agreed
by
both
parties
that
Sir
Ralph
should
pronounce
a
final
decision
,
to
be
accepted
by
them
,
and
to
that
effect
they
signed
an
agreement
.
<EOS>
The
three
persons
appointed
to
the
investigation
settled
to
start
for
Rough
Lee
early
on
the
following
morning
.
 
<EOS>
A
word
as
to
Master
Thomas
Potts
.
<EOS>
This
worthy
was
an
attorney
from
London
,
who
had
officiated
as
clerk
of
the
court
at
the
assizes
at
Lancaster
,
where
his
quickness
had
so
much
pleased
Roger
Nowell
,
that
he
sent
for
him
to
Read
to
manage
this
particular
business
.
<EOS>
A
sharp
-
witted
fellow
was
Potts
,
and
versed
in
all
the
quirks
and
tricks
of
a
very
subtle
profession
--
not
over
-
scrupulous
,
<EOS>
provided
a
client
would
pay
well
;
prepared
to
resort
to
any
expedient
to
gain
his
object
,
and
quite
conversant
enough
with
both
practice
and
precedent
to
keep
himself
straight
.
<EOS>
A
bustling
,
consequential
little
personage
was
he
,
moreover
;
very
fond
of
delivering
an
opinion
,
even
when
unasked
,
and
of
a
meddling
,
make
-
mischief
turn
,
constantly
setting
men
by
the
ears
.
<EOS>
A
suit
of
rusty
black
,
a
parchment
-
coloured
skin
,
small
wizen
features
,
a
turn
-
up
nose
,
scant
eyebrows
,
and
a
great
yellow
forehead
,
constituted
his
external
man
.
<EOS>
He
partook
of
the
hospitality
at
the
Abbey
,
but
had
his
quarters
at
the
Dragon
.
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
it
was
who
counselled
Roger
Nowell
to
abide
by
the
decision
of
Sir
Ralph
,
confidently
assuring
him
that
he
must
carry
his
point
.
 
<EOS>
This
dispute
was
not
,
however
,
the
only
one
the
knight
had
to
adjust
,
or
in
which
Master
Potts
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
A
claim
had
recently
been
made
by
a
certain
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
of
Nappay
,
in
Wensleydale
,
near
Bainbridge
,
to
the
house
and
manor
of
Raydale
,
belonging
to
his
neighbour
,
John
Robinson
,
whose
lady
,
as
has
been
shown
,
was
a
relative
of
the
Asshetons
.
<EOS>
Robinson
himself
had
gone
to
London
to
obtain
advice
on
the
subject
,
while
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
,
who
was
a
man
of
violent
disposition
,
had
threatened
to
take
forcible
possession
of
Raydale
,
if
it
were
not
delivered
to
him
without
delay
,
and
to
eject
the
Robinson
family
.
<EOS>
Having
consulted
Potts
,
however
,
on
the
subject
,
whom
he
had
met
at
Read
,
the
latter
strongly
dissuaded
him
from
the
course
,
and
recommended
him
to
call
to
his
aid
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
:
but
this
he
rejected
,
though
he
ultimately
agreed
to
refer
the
matter
to
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
and
for
this
purpose
he
had
come
over
to
Whalley
,
and
was
at
present
a
guest
at
the
vicarage
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
will
be
seen
that
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
had
his
hands
full
,
while
the
little
London
lawyer
,
Master
Potts
,
was
tolerably
well
occupied
.
<EOS>
Besides
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
,
Sir
Richard
Molyneux
,
and
Mr.
Parker
of
Browsholme
,
were
guests
of
Dr.
Ormerod
at
the
vicarage
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
large
company
assembled
to
witness
the
May
-
day
revels
at
Whalley
,
and
if
harmonious
feelings
did
not
exist
amongst
all
of
them
,
little
outward
manifestation
was
made
of
enmity
.
<EOS>
The
dresses
and
appointments
of
the
pageant
having
been
provided
by
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
who
,
Puritan
as
he
was
,
encouraged
all
harmless
country
pastimes
,
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
pay
him
every
respect
,
even
if
no
other
feeling
would
have
prompted
the
attention
,
and
therefore
the
troop
had
stopped
on
seeing
him
and
his
guests
issue
from
the
Abbey
gate
.
<EOS>
At
pretty
nearly
the
same
time
Doctor
Ormerod
and
his
party
came
from
the
vicarage
towards
the
green
.
 
<EOS>
No
order
of
march
was
observed
,
but
Sir
Ralph
and
his
lady
,
with
two
of
his
children
by
the
former
marriage
,
walked
first
.
<EOS>
Then
came
some
of
the
other
ladies
,
with
the
Rector
of
Middleton
,
John
Braddyll
,
and
the
two
sons
of
Mistress
Robinson
.
<EOS>
Next
came
Mistress
Nutter
,
Roger
Nowell
and
Potts
walking
after
her
,
eyeing
her
maliciously
,
as
her
proud
figure
swept
on
before
them
.
<EOS>
Even
if
she
saw
their
looks
or
overheard
their
jeers
,
she
did
not
deign
to
notice
them
.
<EOS>
Lastly
came
young
Richard
Assheton
,
of
Middleton
,
and
Squire
Nicholas
,
both
in
high
spirits
,
and
laughing
and
chatting
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
brave
day
for
the
morris
-
dancers
,
cousin
Dick
,
"
observed
Nicholas
Assheton
,
as
they
approached
the
green
,
"
and
plenty
of
folk
to
witness
the
sport
.
<EOS>
Half
my
lads
from
Downham
are
here
,
and
I
see
a
good
many
of
your
Middleton
chaps
among
them
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
,
Farmer
Tetlow
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
a
stout
,
hale
-
looking
man
,
with
a
blooming
country
woman
by
his
side--"brought
your
pretty
young
wife

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh

rejoined
the
farmer
,
"
an

"
 
<EOS>
"
Happy
to
hear

Master
Tetlow

replied
Nicholas
,
"
she
'll
be
better
pleased
before
the

I
'll
warrant
her

<EOS>
I
'll

<EOS>
"

said
Tetlow
,
nudging
his
pretty
wife
,
who
had
turned
away
,
rather
embarrassed
by
the
free
gaze
of
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
however
,
did
not
wait
for
the
curtsy
,
but
went
away
,
laughing
,
to
overtake
Richard
Assheton
,
who
had
walked
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
here
's
Frank
Garside
,
"
he
continued
,
espying
another
rustic
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Halloa
,
Frank
,
I
'll
come
over
one
day
next
week
,
and
try
for
a
fox
in
Easington
Woods
.
<EOS>
We
missed
the
last
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Tom
Brockholes
,
are
you
here
?
<EOS>
Just
ridden
over
from
Sladeburne
,
eh
?
<EOS>
When
is
that
shooting
match
at
the
bodkin
to
come
off
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Mind
,
it
is
to
be
at
twenty
-
two
roods
'
distance
.
<EOS>
Ride
over
to
Downham
on
Thursday
next
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
We
're
to
have
a
foot
-
race
,
and
I
'll
show
you
good
sport
,
and
at
night
we
'll
have
a
lusty
drinking
bout
at
the
alehouse
.
<EOS>
On
Friday
,
we
'll
take
out
the
great
nets
,
and
try
for
salmon
in
the
Ribble
.
<EOS>
I
took
some
fine
fish
on
Monday
--
one
salmon
of
ten
pounds
'
weight
,
<EOS>
the
largest
I
've
got
the
whole
season.--I
brought
it
with
me
to
-
day
to
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
There
's
an
otter
in
the
river
,
and
I
wo
n't
hunt
him
till
you
come
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
on
Thursday
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
Receiving
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
squire
Nicholas
walked
on
,
nodding
right
and
left
,
jesting
with
the
farmers
,
and
ogling
their
pretty
wives
and
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
cousin
Dick
,
"
he
said
,
calling
after
Richard
Assheton
,
who
had
got
in
advance
of
him
,
"
I
'll
match
my
dun
nag
against
your
grey
gelding
for
twenty
pieces

that
I

the
Rough

<EOS>
What

<EOS>
You

I
shall

<EOS>
Well
,
we
'll

tits
the
first
day
we
hunt
the
stag
in
Bowland
Forest
.
<EOS>
Odds
my

"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
suddenly
altering
his
deportment
and
lengthening
his
visage
,
"
if
there
is
n't
our
parson
here
.
<EOS>
Stay
with

,
cousin
Dick
,
stay
with
me
.
<EOS>
Give
you
good
-
day
,
worthy
Mr.
Dewhurst
,
"
he
added
,
taking
off
his
hat
to
the
divine
,
who
respectfully
returned
his
salutation
,
"
I
did
not
look
to
see
your
reverence
here
,
taking
part
in
these
vanities
and
idle
sports
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
call
on
you
on
Saturday
,
and
pass
an
hour
in
serious
discourse
.
<EOS>
I
would
call
to
-
morrow
,
but
I
have
to
ride
over
to
Pendle
on
business
.
<EOS>
Tarry
a
moment
for
me
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
good
cousin
Richard
.
<EOS>
I
fear
,
reverend
sir
,
that
you
will
see
much
here
that
will
scandalise
you
;
much
lightness
and
indecorum
.
<EOS>
Pleasanter
far
would
it
be
to
me
to
see
a
large
congregation
of
the
elders
flocking
together
to
a
godly
meeting
,
than
crowds
assembled
for
such
a
profane
purpose
.
<EOS>
Another
moment
,
Richard
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
is
a
young
man
,
Mr.
Dewhurst
,
and
wishes
to
join
the
revel
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
make
allowances
,
worthy
and
reverend
sir
,
until
the
world
shall
improve
.
<EOS>
An
excellent
discourse
you
gave
us
,
good
sir
,
on
Sunday
:
viii
.
<EOS>
Rom
.
<EOS>
12
and
13
verses
:
it
is
graven
upon
my
memory
,
but
I
have
made
a
note
of
it
in
my
diary
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
you
,
cousin
,
I
come
.
<EOS>
I
pray
you
walk
on
to
the
Abbey
,
<EOS>
good
Mr.
Dewhurst
,
where
you
will
be
right
welcome
,
and
call
for
any
refreshment
you
may
desire
--
a
glass
of
good
sack
,
and
a
slice
of
venison
pasty
,
on
which
we
have
just
dined
--
and
there
is
some
famous
old
ale
,
which
I
would
commend
to
you
,
but
that
I
know
you
care
not
,
any
more
than
myself
,
for
creature
comforts
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
reverend
sir
.
<EOS>
I
will
join
you
ere
long
,
for
these
scenes
have
little
attraction
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
take
care
that
my
young
cousin
falleth
not
into
harm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
divine
took
his
way
to
the
Abbey
,
he
added
,
laughingly
,
to
Richard,--"A
good
riddance
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
the
old
fellow
play
the
spy
upon
us.--Ah
,
Giles
Mercer
,
"
he
added
,
stopping
again,--"and
Jeff
Rushton
<EOS>
--
well
met
,
lads
!
<EOS>
what
,
are
you
come
to
the
wake
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
John
Lawe
's
in
the
evening
,
and
we
'll
have
a
glass
together
--
<EOS>
John
brews
sack
rarely
,
and
spareth
not
the
eggs

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Boh

th

dawncing
at
th

Abbey
,

"
said
one
of
the
farmers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Curse
the
dancing
!
"
<EOS>
cried
<EOS>
Nicholas--"I
hope
the
parson
did
n't
hear
me
,
"
he
added
,
turning
round
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
I
'll
come
down
when
the
dancing
's
over
,
and
we
'll
make
a
night
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
ran
on
to
overtake
Richard
Assheton
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
respective
parties
from
the
Abbey
and
the
Vicarage
having
united
,
they
walked
on
together
,
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
after
courteously
exchanging
salutations
with
Dr.
Ormerod
's
guests
,
still
keeping
a
little
in
advance
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
comported
himself
with
more
than
his
wonted
haughtiness
,
and
bowed
so
superciliously
to
Mistress
Robinson
,
that
her
two
sons
glanced
angrily
at
each
other
,
as
if
in
doubt
whether
they
should
not
instantly
resent
the
affront
.
<EOS>
Observing
this
,
as
well
as
what
had
previously
taken
place
,
Nicholas
Assheton
stepped
quickly
up
to
them
,
and
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
quiet
,
lads
.
<EOS>
Leave
this
dunghill
cock
to
me
,
and
I
'll
lower
his
crest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
pushed
forward
,
and
elbowing
Sir
Thomas
rudely
out
of
the
way
,
turned
round
,
and
,
instead
of
apologising
,
eyed
him
coolly
and
contemptuously
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
drunk
,
sir
,
that
you
forget
your
manners
?
"
asked
Sir
Thomas
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
drunk
but
that
I
know
how
to
conduct
myself
like
a
gentleman
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
"
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
a
certain
person
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
,
for
aught
I
know
,
has
only
taken
his
morning
pint
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
wish
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
,
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
,
stepping
close
up
to
him
,
"
and
I
will
not
disappoint
you
.
<EOS>
You
shall
render
me
good
reason
for
this
affront
before
I
leave
Whalley
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
and
where
you
please
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
hour
,
and
at
any
weapon
,
I
am
your
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Master
Potts
,
who
had
scented
a
quarrel
afar
,
and
who
would
have
liked
it
well
enough
if
its
prosecution
had
not
run
counter
to
his
own
interests
,
quitted
Roger
Nowell
,
and
ran
back
to
Metcalfe
,
and
plucking
him
by
the
sleeve
,
said
,
in
a
low
voice--
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
the
way
to
obtain
quiet
possession
of
Raydale
House
,
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
him
,
"
I
must
entreat
you
,
my
good
sir
,
to
be
moderate
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
both
,
I
caution
you
that
I
have
my
eye
upon
you
.
<EOS>
You
well
know
there
is
a
magistrate
here
,
my
singular
good
friend
and
honoured
client
,
Master
Roger
Nowell
,
and
if
you
pursue
this
quarrel
further
,
I
shall
hold
it
my
duty
to
have
you
bound
over
by
that
worthy
gentleman
in
sufficient
securities
to
keep
the
peace
towards
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
and
all
his
lieges
,
and
particularly
towards
each
other
.
<EOS>
You
understand
me
,
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
drink
at
John
Lawe
's
to
-
night
,
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
walked
away
.
<EOS>
Metcalfe
would
have
followed
him
,
but
was
withheld
by
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
go
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
said
the
little
man
of
law
;
"
let
him
go
.
<EOS>
Once
master
of
Raydale
,
you
can
do
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
Leave
the
settlement
of
the
matter
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
just
whisper
a
word
in
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
's
ear
,
and
you
'll
hear
no
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fire
and
fury
!
<EOS>
"
growled
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
not
this
mode
of
settling
a
quarrel
;
and
unless
this
hot
-
headed
psalm
-
singing
puritan
apologises
,
I
shall
assuredly
cut
his
throat
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Or
he
yours
,
good
Sir
Thomas
,
"
rejoined
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
Better
sit
in
Raydale
Hall
,
than
lie
in
the
Abbey
vaults
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
'll
talk
over
the
matter
,
Master
Potts
,
"
replied
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
nice
morning
's
work
I
've
made
of
it
,
"
mused
Nicholas
,
as
he
walked
along
;
"
here
I
have
a
dance
with
a
farmer
's
pretty

<EOS>
Nicholas
just
got
up
in
time
to
witness
the
presentation
of
the
May
Queen
to
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
and
his
lady
,
and
like
every
one
else
he
was
greatly
struck
by
her
extreme
beauty
and
natural
grace
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
ceremony
was
thus
conducted
.
<EOS>
When
the
company
from
the
Abbey
drew
near
the
troop
of
revellers
,
the
usher
taking
Alizon
's
hand
in
the
tips
of
his
fingers
as
before
,
strutted
forward
with
her
to
Sir
Ralph
and
his
lady
,
and
falling
upon
one
knee
before
them
,
said,--"Most
worshipful
and
honoured
knight
,
and
you
his
lovely
dame
,
and
you
the
tender
and
cherished
olive
branches
growing
round
about
their
tables
<EOS>
,
I
hereby
crave
your
gracious
permission
to
present
unto
your
honours
our
chosen
Queen
of
<EOS>
May.
"
 
Somewhat
fluttered
by
the
presentation
,
Alizon
yet
maintained
sufficient
composure
to
bend
gracefully
before
Lady
Assheton
,
and
say
in
a
very
sweet
voice
,
"
I
fear
your
ladyship
will
think
the
choice
of
the
village
hath
fallen
ill
in
alighting
upon
me
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
feel
myself
altogether
unworthy
the
distinction
;
nevertheless
I
will
endeavour
to
discharge
my
office
fittingly
,
and
therefore
pray
you
,
fair
lady
,
and
the
worshipful
knight
,
your
husband
,
together
with
your
beauteous
children
,
and
the
gentles
all
by
whom
you
are
surrounded
,
to
grace
our
little
festival
with
your
presence
,
hoping
you
may
find
as
much
pleasure
in
the
sight
as
we
shall
do
in
offering
it
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
fair
maid
,
and
modest
as
she
is
fair
,
"
observed
Sir
Ralph
,
with
a
condescending
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
sooth
is
she
,
"
replied
Lady
Assheton
,
raising
her
kindly
,
and
saying
,
as
she
did
so--
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
you
must
not
kneel
to
us
,
sweet
maid
.
<EOS>
You
are
queen
of
May
,
and
it
is
for
us
to
show
respect
to
you
during
your
day
of
sovereignty
.
<EOS>
Your
wishes
are
commands
;
and
,
in
behalf
of
my
husband
,
my
children
,
and
our
guests
,
I
answer
,
that
we
will
gladly
attend
your
revels
on
the
green
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
dear
Nell
,
"
observed
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
be
churlish
,
indeed
,
were
we
to
refuse
the
bidding
of
so
lovely
a
queen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
you
have
called
the
roses
in
earnest
to
her
cheek
,
now
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
observed
Lady
Assheton
,
smiling
.
"
<EOS>
Lead
on
,
fair
queen
,
"
she
continued
,
"
and
tell
your
companions
to
begin
their
sports
when
they
please.--Only
remember
this
,
that
we
shall
hope
to
see
all
your
gay
troop
this
evening
at
the
Abbey
,
to
a
merry
dance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
I
will
strive
to
find
her
majesty
a
suitable
partner
,
"
added
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
she
shall
make
her
choice
now
,
as
a
royal
personage
should
;
for
you
know
,
Nell
,
a
queen
ever
chooseth
her
partner
,
whether
it
be
for
the
throne
or
for
the
brawl
.
<EOS>
How
gay
you
,
fair
one
?
<EOS>
Shall
it
be
either
of
our
young
cousins
,
Joe
or
Will
Robinson
of
Raydale
;
or
our
cousin
who
still
thinketh
himself
young
,
Squire
Nicholas
of
Downham
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
let
it
be
me
,
I
implore
of
you
,
fair
queen
,
"
interposed
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
engaged
already
,
"
observed
Richard
Assheton
,
coming
forward
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
him
ask
pretty
Mistress
Tetlow
,
the
farmer
's
wife
,
to
dance
with
him
this
evening
at
the
Abbey
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
loud
laugh
from
those
around
followed
this
piece
of
information
,
but
Nicholas
was
in
no
wise
disconcerted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dick
would
have
her
choose
him
,
and
that
is
why
he
interferes
with
me
,
"
he
observed
.
<EOS>
"
How
say
you
,
fair
queen
!
<EOS>
Shall
it
be
our
hopeful
cousin
?
<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
him
that
he
danceth
the
coranto
and
lavolta
indifferently
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
hearing
Richard
Assheton
's
voice
,
all
the
colour
had
forsaken
Alizon
's
cheeks
;
but
at
this
direct
appeal
to
her
by
Nicholas
,
it
returned
with
additional
force
,
and
the
change
did
not
escape
the
quick
eye
of
Lady
Assheton
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
perplex
her
,
cousin
Nicholas
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
whit
,
Eleanor
,
"
answered
the
squire
;
"
but
if
she
like
not
Dick
Assheton
,
there
is
another
Dick
,
Dick
Sherburne
of
Sladeburn
;
or
our
cousin
,
Jack
Braddyll
;
or
,
if
she
prefer
an
older
and
discreeter
man
,
there
is
Father
Greenacres
of
Worston
,
or
Master
Roger
Nowell
of
Read
--
plenty
of
choice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
if
I
must
choose
a
partner
,
it
shall
be
a
young
one
,
"
said
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Right
,
fair
queen
,
right
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ever
choose
a
young
man
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
Who
shall
it
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
named
him
yourself
,
sir
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
in
a
voice
which
she
endeavoured
to
keep
firm
,
but
which
,
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
,
sounded
tremulously--"Master
Richard
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Next
to
choosing
me
,
you
could
not
have
chosen
better
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
approvingly
.
<EOS>
"
Dick
,
lad
,
I
congratulate
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
congratulate
myself
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
Fair
queen
,
"
he
added
,
advancing
,
"
highly
flattered
am
I
by
your
choice
,
and
shall
so
demean
myself
,
I
trust
,
as
to
prove
myself
worthy
of
it
.
<EOS>
Before
I
go
,
I
would
beg
a
boon
from
you
--
that
flower
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
pink
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
yours
,
fair
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
Young
Assheton
took
the
flower
and
took
the
hand
that
offered
it
at
the
same
time
,
and
pressed
the
latter
to
his
lips
;
while
Lady
Assheton
,
who
had
been
made
a
little
uneasy
by
Alizon
's
apparent
emotion
,
and
who
with
true
feminine
tact
immediately
detected
its
cause
,
called
out
:
"
<EOS>
Now
,
forward
--
forward
to
the
May
-
pole
!
<EOS>
We
have
interrupted
the
revel
too
long
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
May
Queen
stepped
blushingly
back
with
the
usher
,
who
,
with
his
white
wand
in
hand
,
had
stood
bolt
upright
behind
her
,
immensely
delighted
with
the
scene
in
which
his
pupil
--
for
Alizon
had
been
tutored
by
him
for
the
occasion
--
had
taken
part
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
then
clapped
his
hands
loudly
,
and
at
this
signal
the
tabor
and
pipe
struck
up
;
the
Fool
and
the
Hobby
-
horse
,
who
,
though
idle
all
the
time
,
had
indulged
in
a
little
quiet
fun
with
the
rustics
,
recommenced
their
gambols
;
the
Morris
-
dancers
their
lively
dance
;
and
the
whole
train
moved
towards
the
May
-
pole
,
followed
by
the
rush
-
cart
,
with
all
its
bells
jingling
,
and
all
its
garlands
waving
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Alizon
,
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
,
and
her
bosom
heaved
so
quickly
,
that
she
thought
she
should
faint
.
<EOS>
To
think
that
the
choice
of
a
partner
in
the
dance
at
the
Abbey
had
been
offered
her
,
and
that
she
should
venture
to
choose
Master
Richard
Assheton
!
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
credit
her
own
temerity
.
<EOS>
And
then
to
think
that
she
should
give
him
a
flower
,
and
,
more
than
all
,
that
he
should
kiss
her
hand
in
return
for
it
!
<EOS>
She
felt
the
tingling
pressure
of
his
lips
upon
her
finger
still
,
and
her
little
heart
palpitated
strangely
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
approached
the
May
-
pole
,
and
the
troop
again
halted
for
a
few
minutes
,
she
saw
her
brother
James
holding
little
Jennet
by
the
hand
,
standing
in
the
front
line
to
look
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
here
,
Jennet
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
ey'm
glad
to
see
yo
,
Alizon
,
"
replied
the
little
girl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jem
has
towd
me
whot
a
grand
partner
you
're
to
ha
'
this
e'en
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
she
added
,
with
playful
malice
,
"
Who
was
wrong
whon
<EOS>
she
said
the
queen
could
choose
Master
Richard--
"
 
"
Hush
,
Jennet
,
not
a
word
more
,
"
interrupted
Alizon
,
blushing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
ey
dunna
mean
to
vex
ye
<EOS>
,
ey'm
sure
,
"
replied
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
Ey've
got
a
present
for
ye
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
present
for
me
,
Jennet
,
"
cried
Alizon
;
"
what
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
beautiful
white
dove
,
"
replied
the
little
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
white
dove
!
<EOS>
Where
did
you
get
it
?
<EOS>
Let
me
see
it
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
in
a
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
,
"
replied
Jennet
,
opening
her
kirtle
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
beautiful
bird
,
indeed
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
it
for
me
till
I
come
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Which
winna
be
till
late
,
ey
fancy
,
"
rejoined
Jennet
,
roguishly
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
uttering
a
cry
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
the
sudden
flight
of
the
dove
,
which
,
escaping
from
her
hold
,
soared
aloft
.
<EOS>
Jennet
followed
the
course
of
its
silver
wings
,
as
they
cleaved
the
blue
sky
,
and
then
all
at
once
saw
a
large
hawk
,
which
apparently
had
been
hovering
about
,
swoop
down
upon
it
,
and
bear
it
off
.
<EOS>
Some
white
feathers
fell
down
near
the
little
girl
,
and
she
picked
up
one
of
them
and
put
it
in
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
bird
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
May
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eigh
,
poor
bird
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Jennet
,
tearfully
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,

Alizon
.
"
 
"
Weel
,

observed
Jem
,
gruffly
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
There

"
sobbed
the
little
girl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shoot

,

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How

<EOS>
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
dunna
understand

,
Jem
,
"
replied
the
child
,
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
the
music
,
which
had
ceased
while
some
arrangements
were
made
,
commenced
a
very
lively
tune
,
known
as
"
Round
about
the
May
-
pole
,
"
and
Robin
Hood
,
taking
the
May
Queen
's
hand
,
led
her
towards
the
pole
,
and
placing
her
near
it
,
the
whole
of
her
attendants
took
hands
,
while
a
second
circle
was
formed
by
the
morris
-
dancers
,
and
both
began
to
wheel
rapidly
round
her
,
the
music
momently
increasing
in
spirit
and
quickness
.
<EOS>
An
irresistible
desire
to
join
in
the
measure
seized
some
of
the
lads
and
lasses
around
,
and
they
likewise
took
hands
,
and
presently
a
third
and
still
wider
circle
was
formed
,
wheeling
gaily
round
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
Other
dances
were
formed
here
and
there
,
and
presently
the
whole
green
was
in
movement
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
come
off
heart
-
whole
to
-
night
,
Dick
,
I
shall
be
surprised
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
who
with
his
young
relative
had
approached
as
near
the
May
-
pole
as
the
three
rounds
of
dancers
would
allow
them
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
Assheton
made
no
reply
,
but
glanced
at
the
pink
which
he
had
placed
in
his
doublet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
May
Queen
?
"
inquired
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
,
who
had
likewise
drawn
near
,
of
a
tall
man
holding
a
little
girl
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
,
dowter
of
Elizabeth
Device
,
an
mey
sister
,
"
replied
James
Device
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Sir
Thomas
,
"
she
is
a
well
-
looking
lass
.
<EOS>
And
she
dwells
here
--
in
Whalley
,
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hoo
dwells
i
'
Whalley
,
"
responded
Jem
,
sullenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
find
her
abode
,
"
muttered
the
knight
,
walking
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
said
to
you
,
Jem
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Nicholas
,
who
had
watched
the
knight
's
gestures
,
coming
up
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
related
what
had
passed
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
does
he
want
with
her
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
good
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
spoil
his
sport
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Say

"
remarked
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Jem
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
your
pretty
sister
,
and
I
'll
take
care
of

"
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Sir
Thomas
,
who
,
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
pacific
Master
Potts
to
tranquillise
him
,
had
been
burning
with
wrath
at
the
affront
he
had
received
from
Nicholas
,
came
up
to
Richard
Assheton
,
and
,
noticing
the
pink
in
his
bosom
,
snatched
it
away
suddenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
a
flower
,
"
he
said
,
smelling
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Instantly
restore
it
,
Sir
Thomas
!
"
cried
Richard
Assheton
,
pale
with
rage
,
"
or--
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
do
,
young
sir
?
"
<EOS>
rejoined
the
knight
tauntingly
,
and
plucking
the
flower
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
get
another
from
the
fair
nymph
who
gave
you
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
Further
speech
was
not
allowed
the
knight
,
for
he
received
a
violent
blow
on
the
chest
from
the
hand
of
Richard
Assheton
,
which
sent
him
reeling
backwards
,
and
would
have
felled
him
to
the
ground
if
he
had
not
been
caught
by
some
of
the
bystanders
.
<EOS>
The
moment
he
recovered
,
Sir
Thomas
drew
his
sword
,
and
furiously
assaulted
young
Assheton
,
who
stood
ready
for
him
,
and
after
the
exchange
of
a
few
passes
,
for
none
of
the
bystanders
dared
to
interfere
,
sent
his
sword
whirling
over
their
heads
through
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
,
Dick
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
stepping
up
,
and
clapping
his
cousin
on
the
back
,
"
you
have
read
him
a
good
lesson
,
and
taught
him
that
he
can
not
always
insult
folks
with
impunity
,
ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
laughed
loudly
at
the
discomfited
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
an
insolent
coward
,
"
said
Richard
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
Give
him
his
sword
and
let
him
come
on
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
"
he
has
had
enough
this
time
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
has
not
,
he
must
settle
an
account
with
me
.
<EOS>
Put
up
your
blade
,
lad
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
revenged
upon
you
both
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
,
taking
his
sword
,
which
had
been
brought
him
by
a
bystander
,
and
stalking
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
leave
us
in
mortal
dread
,
doughty
knight
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
shouting
after
him
,
<EOS>
derisively--"ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
Assheton
's
attention
was
,
however
,
turned
in
a
different
direction
,
for
the
music
suddenly
ceasing
,
and
the
dancers
stopping
<EOS>
,
he
learnt
that
the
May
Queen
had
fainted
,
and
presently
afterwards
the
crowd
opened
to
give
passage
to
Robin
Hood
,
who
bore
her
inanimate
form
in
his
arms
.

CHAPTER
IV.--ALICE
NUTTER
.
  
<EOS>
The
quarrel
between
Nicholas
Assheton
and
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
had
already
been
made
known
to
Sir
Ralph
by
the
officious
Master
Potts
,
and
though
it
occasioned
the
knight
much
displeasure
;
as
interfering
with
the
amicable
arrangement
he
hoped
to
effect
with
Sir
Thomas
for
his
relatives
the
Robinsons
,
still
he
felt
sure
that
he
had
sufficient
influence
with
his
hot
-
headed
cousin
,
the
squire
,
to
prevent
the
dispute
from
being
carried
further
,
and
he
only
waited
the
conclusion
of
the
sports
on
the
green
,
to
take
him
to
task
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
knight
's
surprise
and
annoyance
,
therefore
,
to
find
that
a
new
brawl
had
sprung
up
,
and
,
ignorant
of
its
precise
cause
,
he
laid
it
entirely
at
the
door
of
the
turbulent
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
on
the
commencement
of
the
fray
he
imagined
that
the
squire
was
personally
concerned
in
it
,
and
full
of
wroth
,
flew
to
the
scene
of
action
;
but
before
he
got
there
,
the
affair
,
which
,
as
has
been
seen
,
was
of
short
duration
,
was
fully
settled
,
and
<EOS>
he
only
heard
the
jeers
addressed
to
the
retreating
combatant
by
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
Sir
Ralph
's
way
to
vent
his
choler
in
words
,
but
the
squire
knew
in
an
instant
,
from
the
expression
of
his
countenance
,
that
he
was
greatly
incensed
,
and
therefore
hastened
to
explain
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
means
this
unseemly
disturbance
,
Nicholas
?
"
cried
Sir
Ralph
,
not
allowing
the
other
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
ever
brawling
like
an
Alsatian
squire
.
<EOS>
Independently
of
the
ill
example
set
to
these
good
folk
,
who
have
met
here
for
tranquil
amusement
,
you
have
counteracted
all
my
plans
for
the
adjustment
of
the
differences
between
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
and
our
aunt
of
Raydale
.
<EOS>
If
you
forget
what
is
due
to
yourself
,
sir
,
do
not
forget
what
is
due
to
me
,
and
to
the
name
you
bear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
but
yourself
should
say
as
much
to
me
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
somewhat
haughtily
;
"
but
you
are
under
a
misapprehension
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
I
who
have
been
fighting
,
though
I
should
have
acted
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
our
cousin
Dick
,
if
I
had
received
the
same
affront
,
and
so
I
make
bold
to
say
would
you
.
<EOS>
Our
name
shall
suffer
no
discredit
from
me
;
and
as
a
gentleman
,
I
assert
,
that
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
has
only
received
due
chastisement
,
as
you
yourself
will
admit
,
cousin
,
when
you
know
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
to
be
overbearing
,
"
observed
Sir
Ralph
.
 
<EOS>
"
Overbearing
is
not
the
word
,
cousin
,
"
interrupted
Nicholas
;
"
he
is
as
proud
as
a
peacock
,
and
would
trample
upon
us
all
,
and
gore
us
too
,
like
one
of
the
wild
bulls
of
Bowland
,
if
we
would
let
him
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
treat
him
as
I
would
the
bull
aforesaid
,
a
wild
boar
,
or
any
other
savage
and
intractable
beast
,
hunt
him
down
,
and
poll
his
horns
,
or
pluck
out
his
tusks
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Nicholas
,
this
is
no
very
gentle
language
,
"
remarked
Sir
Ralph
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
speak
truth
,
cousin
,
I
do
not
feel
in
any
very
gentle
frame
of
mind
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
;
"
my
ire
has
been
roused
by
this
insolent
braggart
,
my
blood
is
up
,
and
I
long
to
be
doing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unchristian
feelings
,
Nicholas
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
,
severely
,
"
and
should
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
Turn
the
other
cheek
to
the
smiter
.
<EOS>
I
trust
you
bear
no
malice
to
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
bear
him
no
malice
,
for
I
hope
malice
is
not
in
my
nature
,
cousin
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
but
I
owe
him
a
grudge
,
and
when
a
fitting
opportunity
occurs--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
unless
you
would
really
incur
my
displeasure
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Ralph
;
"
the
matter
has
gone
far
enough
,
too
far
,
perhaps
for
amendment
,
and
if
you
know
it
not
,
I
can
tell
you
that
Sir
Thomas
's
claims
to
Raydale
will
be
difficult
to
dispute
,
and
<EOS>
so
our
uncle
Robinson
has
found
since
he
hath
taken
counsel
on
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Have
a
care
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
noticing
that
Master
Potts
was
approaching
them
,
with
his
ears
evidently
wide
open
,
"
there
is
that
little
London
lawyer
hovering
about
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
give
the
cunning
fox
a
double
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
tone
calculated
to
reach
Potts
,
"
and
since
our
uncle
Robinson
is
so
sure
of
his
cause
,
it
may
be
better
to
let
this
blustering
knight
be
.
<EOS>
Perchance
,
it
is
the
certainty
of
failure
that
makes
him
so
insensate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
meant
to
blind
me
,
but
it
shall
not
serve
your
turn
,
cautelous
squire
,
"
muttered
Potts
;
"
I
caught
enough
of
what
fell
just
now
from
Sir
Ralph
to
satisfy
me
that
he
hath
strong
misgivings
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
best
not
to
appear
too
secure.--Ah
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
he
added
,
coming
forward
,
"
I
was
right
,
you
see
,
in
my
caution
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
of
peace
,
and
strive
to
prevent
quarrels
and
bloodshed
.
<EOS>
Quarrel
if
you
please
--
and
unfortunately
men
are
prone
to
anger
--
but
always
settle
your
disputes
in
a
court
of
law
;
always
in
a
court
of
law
,
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
only
arena
where
a
sensible
man
should
ever
fight
.
<EOS>
Take
good
advice
,
fee
your
counsel
well
,
and
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
in
your
favour
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
I
say
to
my
worthy
and
singular
good
client
,
Sir
Thomas
;
but
he
is
somewhat
headstrong
and
vehement
,
and
will
not
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
for
settling
matters
by
the
sword
,
for
making
forcible
entries
and
detainers
,
and
ousting
the
tenants
in
possession
,
whereby
he
would
render
himself
liable
to
arrest
,
fine
,
ransom
,
and
forfeiture
;
instead
of
proceeding
cautiously
and
decorously
as
the
law
directs
,
and
as
I
advise
,
Sir
Ralph
,
by
writ
of
_
ejectione
firmæ
_
or
action
of
trespass
,
the
which
would
assuredly
establish
his
title
,
and
restore
him
the
house
and
lands
.
<EOS>
Or
he
may
proceed
by
writ
of
right
,
which
perhaps
,
in
his
case
,
considering
the
long
absence
of
possession
,
and
the
doubts
supposed
to
perplex
the
title
--
though
I
myself
have
no
doubts
about
it
--
would
be
the
most
efficacious
.
<EOS>
These
are
your
only
true
weapons
,
Sir
Ralph
--
your
writs
of
entry
,
assise
,
and
right
--
your
pleas
of
novel
disseisin
,
post
-
disseisin
,
and
re
-
disseisin
--
your
remitters
,
your
præcipes
,
your
pones
,
and
your
recordari
faciases
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
sword
,
shield
,
and
armour
of
proof
of
a
wise
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Zounds
!
<EOS>
you
take
away
one
's
breath
with
this
hail
-
storm
of
writs
and
pleas
,
master
lawyer
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
.
"
<EOS>
But
in
one
respect
I
am
of
your
'
worthy
and
singular
good
'
client
's
,
opinion
,
and
would
rather
trust
to
my
own
hand
for
the
defence
of
my
property
than
to
the
law
to
keep
it
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
would
do
wrong
,
good
Master
Nicholas
,
"
rejoined
Potts
,
with
a
smile
of
supreme
contempt
;
"
for
the
law
is
the
better
guardian
and
the
stronger
adversary
of
the
two
,
and
so
Sir
Thomas
will
find
if
he
takes
my
advice
,
and
obtains
,
as
he
can
and
will
do
,
a
perfect
title
_
juris
et
seisinæ
conjunctionem
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Thomas
is
still
willing
to
refer
the
case
to
my
arbitrament
,
I
believe
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sir
Ralph
,
uneasily
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
so
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
rejoined
Potts
,
"
unless
the
assaults
and
batteries
,
with
intent
to
do
him
grievous
corporeal
hurt
,
which
he
hath
sustained
from
your
relatives
,
have
induced
a
change
of
mind
in
him
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
premised
,
Sir
Ralph
,
I
am
a
man
of
peace
,
and
willing
to
intermediate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Provided
you
get
your
fee
,
master
lawyer
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
sarcastically
.
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
I
object
not
to
the
_
quiddam
honorarium
_
,
Master
Nicholas
,
"
rejoined
Potts
;
"
and
if
my
client
hath
the
_
quid
pro
quo
_
,
and
gaineth
his
point
,
he
can
not
<EOS>
complain.--But
what
is
this
?
<EOS>
Some
fresh
disturbance
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Something
hath
happened
to
the
May
Queen
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
not
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
,
with
real
concern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
she
has
fainted
.
<EOS>
They
are
bringing
her
this
way
.
<EOS>
Poor
maid
!
<EOS>
what
can
have
occasioned
this
sudden
seizure
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
give
a
guess
,
"
muttered
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
Better
remove
her
to
the
Abbey
,
"
he
added
aloud
to
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"
Our
cousin
Dick
is
near
her
,
I
observe
.
<EOS>
He
shall
see
her
conveyed
there
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Lady
Assheton
and
Mrs.
Nutter
,
with
some
of
the
other
ladies
,
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
in
time
,
Nell
,
"
cried
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
your
smelling
-
bottle
about
you
?
<EOS>
The
May
Queen
has
fainted
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Assheton
,
springing
towards
Alizon
,
who
was
now
sustained
by
young
Richard
Assheton
;
the
forester
having
surrendered
her
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
How
has
this
happened
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
giving
her
to
breathe
at
a
small
phial
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
can
not
tell
you
,
cousin
,
"
replied
Richard
Assheton
,
"
unless
from
some
sudden
fright
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
it
,
Master
Richard
,
"
cried
Robin
Hood
;
"
she
cried
out
on
hearing
the
clashing
of
swords
just
now
,
and
,
I
think
,
pronounced
your
name
,
on
finding
you
engaged
with
Sir
Thomas
,
and
immediately
after
turned
pale
,
and
would
have
fallen
if
I
had
not
caught
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Assheton
,
glancing
at
Richard
,
whose
eyes
fell
before
her
inquiring
gaze
.
"
<EOS>
But
see
,
she
revives
,
"
pursued
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
support
her
head
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
Alizon
opened
her
eyes
,
and
perceiving
Richard
Assheton
,
who
had
relinquished
her
to
his
relative
,
standing
beside
her
,
she
exclaimed
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
are
safe
!
<EOS>
I
feared"--And
<EOS>
then
she
stopped
,
greatly
embarrassed
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
feared
he
might
be
in
danger
from
his
fierce
adversary
,
"
supplied
Lady
Assheton
;
"
but
no
.
<EOS>
The
conflict
is
happily
over
,
and
he
is
unhurt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
said
Alizon
,
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
had
better
be
taken
to
the
Abbey
,
"
remarked
Sir
Ralph
,
coming
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
she
will
be
more
at
ease
at
home
,
"
observed
Lady
Assheton
with
a
significant
look
,
which
,
however
,
failed
in
reaching
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
truly
shall
I
,
gracious
lady
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
"
far
more
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
trouble
enough
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
trouble
at
all
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
,
kindly
;
"
her
ladyship
is
too
happy
to
be
of
service
in
a
case
like
this
.
<EOS>
Are
you
not
,
Nell
?
<EOS>
The
faintness
will
pass
off
presently
.
<EOS>
But
let
her
go
to
the
Abbey
at
once
,
and
remain
there
till
the
evening
's
festivities
,
in
which
she
takes
part
,
commence
.
<EOS>
Give
her
your
arm
,
Dick
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
's
word
was
law
,
and
therefore
Lady
Assheton
made
no
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
But
she
said
quickly
,
"
I
will
take
care
of
her
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
require
no
assistance
,
madam
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
"
since
Sir
Ralph
will
have
me
go
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
you
are
too
kind
,
too
condescending
,
"
she
added
,
reluctantly
taking
Lady
Assheton
's
proffered
arm
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
this
way
they
proceeded
slowly
towards
the
Abbey
,
escorted
by
Richard
Assheton
,
and
attended
by
Mistress
Braddyll
and
some
others
of
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Amongst
those
who
had
watched
the
progress
of
the
May
Queen
's
restoration
with
most
interest
was
Mistress
Nutter
,
though
she
had
not
interfered
;
and
as
Alizon
departed
with
Lady
Assheton
,
she
observed
to
Nicholas
,
who
was
standing
near
,
 
<EOS>
"
Can
this
be
the
daughter
of
Elizabeth
Device
,
and
grand
-
daughter
of--
"
 
"
Your
old
Pendle
witch
,
Mother
Demdike
,
"
supplied
Nicholas
;
"
the
very
same
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
Mistress
Nutter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
wholly
unlike
the
family
,
"
observed
the
lady
,
"
and
her
features
resemble
some
I
have
seen
before
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
does
not
resemble
her
mother
,
undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
though
what
her
grand
-
dame
may
have
been
some
sixty
years
ago
,
when
she
was
Alizon
's
age
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say.--She
<EOS>
is
no
beauty
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Those
finely
modelled
features
,
that
graceful
figure
,
and
those
delicate
hands
<EOS>
,
can
not
surely
belong
to
one
lowly
born
and
bred
?
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
differ
from
the
ordinary
peasant
mould
,
truly
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
ask
me
for
the
lineage
of
a
steed
,
I
can
give
a
guess
at
it
on
sight
of
the
animal
,
but
as
regards
our
own
race
<EOS>
I
'm
at
fault
,
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
question
Elizabeth
Device
about
her
,
"
observed
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Strange
,
I
should
never
have
seen
her
before
,
though
I
know
the
family
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
did
not
know
Mother
Demdike
quite
so
well
,
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
remarked
Nicholas--"a
mischievous
and
malignant
old
witch
,
who
deserves
the
tar
barrel
.
<EOS>
The
only
marvel
is
,
that
she
has
not
been
burned
long
ago
.
<EOS>
I
am
of
opinion
,
with
many
others
,
that
it
was
she
who
bewitched
your
poor
husband
,
Richard
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
a
mournful
shake
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
Alas
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
he
died
from
hard
riding
,
after
hard
drinking
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
only
witchcraft
in
his
case
.
<EOS>
Be
warned
by
his
fate
yourself
,
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hard
riding
after
drinking
was
more
likely
to
sober
him
than
to
kill
him
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
said
just
now
,
I
like
not
this
Mother
Demdike
,
nor
her
rival
in
iniquity
,
old
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
The
devil
only
knows
which
of
the
two
is
worst
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
former
hag
did
not
bewitch
your
husband
to
death
,
as
I
shrewdly
suspect
,
it
is
certain
that
the
latter
mumbling
old
miscreant
killed
my
elder
brother
,
Richard
,
by
her
sorceries
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
Chattox
did
you
a
good
turn
then
,
Nicholas
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
in
making
you
master
of
the
fair
estates
of
Downham
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
far
,
perhaps
,
she
might
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
"
but
I
do
not
like
the
manner
of
it
,
and
would
gladly
see
her
burned
;
nay
,
I
would
fire
the
fagots
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
superstitious
as
the
rest
,
Nicholas
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
I
do
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
witches
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
believe
in
witches
,
with
these
two
living
proofs
to
the
contrary
!
"
cried
Nicholas
,
in
amazement
.
"
Why
,
Pendle
Forest
swarms
with
witches
.
<EOS>
They
burrow
in
the
hill
-
side
like
rabbits
in
a
warren
.
<EOS>
They
are
the
terror
of
the
whole
country
.
<EOS>
No
man
's
cattle
,
goods
,
nor
even
life
,
are
safe
from
them
;
and
the
only
reason
why
these
two
old
hags
,
who
hold
sovereign
sway
over
the
others
,
have
'
scaped
justice
so
long
,
is
because
every
one
is
afraid
to
go
near
them
.
<EOS>
Their
solitary
habitations
are
more
strongly
guarded
than
fortresses
.
<EOS>
Not
believe
in
witches
!
<EOS>
Why
I
should
as
soon
misdoubt
the
Holy
Scriptures
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
because
I
reside
near
them
that
I
have
so
little
apprehension
,
or
rather
no
apprehension
at
all
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
but
to
me
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
and
Mother
Chattox
appear
two
harmless
old
women
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
're
a
couple
of
dangerous
and
damnable
old
hags
,
and
deserve
the
stake
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
discourse
had
been
swallowed
with
greedy
ears
by
the
ever
-
vigilant
Master
Potts
,
who
had
approached
the
speakers
unperceived
;
and
he
now
threw
in
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
there
are
suspected
witches
in
Pendle
Forest
<EOS>
,
I
find
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
it
my
business
to
institute
inquiries
concerning
them
,
when
I
visit
the
place
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Even
if
merely
ill
-
reputed
,
they
must
be
examined
,
and
if
found
innocent
cleared
;
if
not
,
punished
according
to
the
statute
.
<EOS>
Our
sovereign
lord
the
king
holdeth
witches
in
especial
abhorrence
,
and
would
gladly
see
all
such
noxious
vermin
extirpated
from
the
land
,
and
it
will
rejoice
me
to
promote
his
laudable
designs
.
<EOS>
I
must
pray
you
to
afford
me
all
the
assistance
you
can
in
the
discovery
of
these
dreadful
delinquents
,
good
Master
Nicholas
,
and
I
will
care
that
your
services
are
duly
represented
in
the
proper
quarter
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
just
said
,
the
king
taketh
singular
interest
in
witchcraft
,
as
you
may
judge
if
the
learned
tractate
he
hath
put
forth
,
in
form
of
a
dialogue
,
intituled
"
_
Dæmonologie
_
"
hath
ever
met
your
eye
;
and
he
is
never
so
well
pleased
as
when
the
truth
of
his
tenets
are
proved
by
such
secret
offenders
being
brought
to
light
,
and
duly
punished
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
king
's
known
superstitious
dread
of
witches
makes
men
seek
them
out
to
win
his
favour
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
wonderfully
increased
since
the
publication
of
that
baneful
book
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
madam
,
"
replied
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
Our
sovereign
lord
the
king
hath
a
wholesome
and
just
hatred
of
such
evil
-
doers
and
traitors
to
himself
and
heaven
,
and
it
may
be
dread
of
them
,
as
indeed
all
good
men
must
have
;
but
he
would
protect
his
subjects
from
them
,
and
therefore
,
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
,
which
I
trust
will
be
long
and
prosperous
<EOS>
,
he
hath
passed
a
statute
,
whereby
it
is
enacted
'
that
all
persons
invoking
any
evil
spirit
,
or
consulting
,
covenanting
with
,
entertaining
,
employing
,
feeding
,
or
rewarding
any
evil
spirit
;
or
taking
up
dead
bodies
from
their
graves
to
be
used
in
any
witchcraft
,
sorcery
,
charm
,
or
enchantment
;
or
killing
or
otherwise
hurting
any
person
by
such
infernal
arts
,
shall
be
guilty
of
felony
without
benefit
of
clergy
,
and
suffer
death
.
'
<EOS>
This
statute
,
madam
,
was
intended
to
check
the
crimes
of
necromancy
,
sorcery
,
and
witchcraft
,
and
not
to
increase
them
.
<EOS>
And
I
maintain
that
it
has
checked
them
,
and
will
continue
to
check
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
wicked
and
bloody
statute
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Nutter
,
in
a
deep
tone
,
"
and
many
an
innocent
life
will
be
sacrificed
thereby
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
,
madam
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Master
Potts
,
staring
aghast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
impugn
the
sagacity
and
justice
of
our
high
and
mighty
king
,
the
head
of
the
law
,
and
defender
of
the
faith
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
affirm
that
this
is
a
sanguinary
enactment
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
will
put
power
into
hands
that
will
abuse
it
,
and
destroy
many
guiltless
persons
.
<EOS>
It
will
make
more
witches
than
it
will
find
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Some
are
ready
made
,
methinks
,
"
muttered
Potts
,
"
and
we
need
not
go
far
to
find
them
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
zealous
advocate
for
witches
,
I
must
say
,
madam
,
"
he
added
aloud
,
"
and
I
shall
not
forget
your
arguments
in
their
favour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
my
prejudice
,
I
doubt
not
,
"
she
rejoined
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
to
the
credit
of
your
humanity
,
"
he
answered
,
bowing
,
with
pretended
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
will
aid
you
in
your
search
for
witches
,
Master
Potts
,
"
observed
Nicholas
;
"
for
I
would
gladly
see
the
country
rid
of
these
pests
.
<EOS>
But
I
warn
you
the
quest
will
be
attended
with
risk
,
and
you
will
get
few
to
accompany
you
,
for
all
the
folk
hereabouts
are
mortally
afraid
of
these
terrible
old
hags
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
nothing
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
,
"
replied
Master
Potts
,
courageously
,
"
for
as
our
high
and
mighty
sovereign
hath
well
and
learnedly
observed--'if
<EOS>
witches
be
but
apprehended
and
detained
by
any
private
person
,
upon
other
private
respects
,
their
power
,
no
doubt
,
either
in
escaping
,
or
in
doing
hurt
,
is
no
less
than
ever
<EOS>
it
was
before
.
<EOS>
But
if
,
on
the
other
part
,
their
apprehending
and
detention
be
by
the
lawful
magistrate
upon
the
just
respect
of
their
guiltiness
in
that
craft
,
their
power
is
then
no
greater
than
before
that
ever
they
meddled
with
their
master
.
<EOS>
For
where
God
begins
justly
to
strike
by
his
lawful
lieutenants
,
it
is
not
in
the
devil
's
power
to
defraud
or
bereave
him
of
the
office
or
effect
of
his
powerful
and
revenging
sceptre
.
'
<EOS>
Thus
I
am
safe
;
and
I
shall
take
care
to
go
armed
with
a
proper
warrant
,
which
I
shall
obtain
from
a
magistrate
,
my
honoured
friend
and
singular
good
client
,
Master
Roger
Newell
.
<EOS>
This
will
obtain
me
such
assistance
as
I
may
require
,
and
for
due
observance
of
my
authority
.
<EOS>
I
shall
likewise
take
with
me
a
peace

officer
,
or
constable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
do
well
,
Master
Potts
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
"
still
you
must
not
put
faith
in
all
the
idle
tales
<EOS>
told
you
,
for
the
common
folk
hereabouts
are
blindly
and
foolishly
superstitious
,
and
fancy
they
discern
witchcraft
in
every
mischance
,
however
slight
,
that
befalls
them
.
<EOS>
If
ale
turn
sour
after
a
thunder
-
storm
,
the
witch
hath
done
it
;
and
if
the
butter
cometh
not
quickly
,
she
hindereth
it
.
<EOS>
If
the
meat
roast
ill
the
witch
hath
turned
the
spit
;
and
if
the
lumber
pie
taste
ill
<EOS>
she
hath
had
a
finger
in
it
.
<EOS>
If
your
sheep
have
the
foot

rot

<EOS>
your
horses
the
staggers

halt

your
swine
<EOS>
the
measles
--
your
hounds
a
surfeit
--
or
your
cow
slippeth
her
calf
--
the
witch
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all

<EOS>
If
your
maid
hath
a
fit
of
the
sullens
,
or
doeth
<EOS>
her
work
amiss
,
or
your
man
breaketh
a
dish
<EOS>
,
the
witch
is
in
fault
,
and
her
shoulders
can
bear
the
blame
.
<EOS>
On
this
very
day
of
the
year
--
namely
,
May
Day,--the
foolish
folk
hold
any
aged
crone
who
fetcheth
fire
to
be
a
witch
,
and
if
they
catch
a
hedge

hog
among
their
cattle
,
they
will
instantly
beat
it
to
death
with
sticks
,
concluding
it
to
be
an
old
hag
in
that
form
<EOS>
come
to
dry
up
the
milk
of
their
kine

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

These
are
what
Master
Potts
's
royal
authority
would
style
'
mere
old
wives
'
trattles
about
the
fire

observed
Mistress
Nutter
,
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
be
over

credulous

sceptical

"
replied
Potts
.
"
<EOS>
Even
at
my
lodging
in
Chancery
Lane
<EOS>
I
have
a

One
can
not
be
too
cautious
when
one
has
to
fight
against
the
devil
,
or
those
in
league
with
him
.
<EOS>
Your
witch
should
be
put
to
every
ordeal
.
<EOS>
She
should
be
scratched
with
pins
to
draw
blood
from
her
;
weighed
against
the
church
bible
,
though
this
is
not
always
proof
;
forced
to
weep
,
for
a
witch
can
only
shed
three
tears
,
and
those
only
from
the
left
eye
;
or
,
as
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
truly
observeth
--
no
offence
to
you
,
Mistress
<EOS>
Nutter--'Not
so
much
as
their
eyes
are
able
to
shed
tears
,
albeit
the
womenkind
especially
be
able
otherwise
to
shed
tears
at
every
light
occasion
<EOS>
when
they
will
,
yea
,
although
it
were
dissemblingly
like
the
crocodile
;
'
and
set
on
a
stool
for
twenty
-
four
hours
,
with
her
legs
tied
across
,
and
suffered
neither
to
eat
,
drink
,
nor
sleep
during
the
time
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
surest
Way
to
make
her
confess
her
guilt
next
to
swimming
.
<EOS>
If
it
fails
,
then
cast
her
with
her
thumbs
and
toes
tied
across
into
a
pond
,
and
if
she
sink
not
then
<EOS>
is
she
certainly
a
witch
.
<EOS>
Other
trials
there
are
,
as
that
by
scalding
water
--
sticking
knives
across
--
heating
of
the
horseshoe
--
tying
of
knots
--
the
sieve
and
the
shears
;
but
the
only
ordeals
safely
to
be
relied
on
,
are
the
swimming
and
the
stool
before
mentioned
,
and
from
these
your
witch
shall
rarely
escape
.
<EOS>
Above
all
,
be
sure
and
search
carefully
for
the
witch
-
mark
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
we
shall
find
it
fairly
and
legibly
writ
in
the
devil
's
characters
on
Mother
Demdike
and
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
They
shall
undergo
the
stool
and
the
pool
,
and
other
trials
,
if
required
.
<EOS>
These
old
hags
shall
no
longer
vex
you
,
good
Master
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
Leave
them
to
me
,
and
doubt
not
I
will
bring
them
to
condign
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
do
us
good
service
then
,
Master
Potts
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
since
you
are
so
learned
in
the
matter
of
witchcraft
,
resolve
me
,
I
pray
you
,
how
it
is
,
that
women
are
so
much
more
addicted
to
the
practice
of
the
black
art
than
our
own
sex
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
answer
to
the
inquiry
hath
been
given
by
our
British
Solomon
,
"
replied
Potts
,
"
and
I
will
deliver
it
to
you
in
his
own
words
.
'
<EOS>
The
reason
is
easy
,
'
he
saith
;
'
for
as
that
sex
is
frailer
than
man
is
,
so
it
is
easier
to
be
entrapped
in
those
gross
snares
of
the
devil
,
as
was
overwell
proved
to
be
true
,
by
the
serpent
's
deceiving
of
Eva
at
the
beginning
,
which
makes
him
the
homelier
with
that
sex
sensine
.
'
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
and
sufficient
reason
,
Master
Potts
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
laughing
;
"
is
it
not
so
,
Mistress
Nutter
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
marry
,
if
it
satisfies
you
,
"
she
answered
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
the
reasoning
of
the
royal
pedant
,
whom
Master
Potts
styles
the
British
Solomon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
give
the
learned
monarch
the
title
by
which
he
is
recognised
throughout
Christendom
,
"
rejoined
Potts
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
there
is
comfort
in
the
thought
,
that
I
shall
never
be
taken
for
a
wizard
,
"
said
the
squire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
not
too
sure
of
that
,
good
Master
Nicholas
,
"
returned
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
Our
present
prince
seems
to
have
had
you
in
his
eye
when
he
penned
his
description
of
a
wizard
,
for
,
he
saith
,
'
A
great
number
of
them
that
ever
have
been
convict
or
confessors
of
witchcraft
,
as
may
be
presently
seen
by
many
that
have
at
this
time
confessed
,
are
some
of
them
rich
and
worldly
-
wise
;
some
of
them
fat
or
corpulent
in
their
bodies
;
and
most
part
of
them
altogether
given
over
to
the
pleasures
of
the
flesh
,
continual
haunting
of
company
,
and
all
kinds
of
merriness
,
lawful
and
unlawful
.
'
<EOS>
This
hitteth
you
exactly
,
Master
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Zounds
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
squire
,
"
if
this
be
exact
,
it
toucheth
me
too
nearly
to
be
altogether
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
passage
is
truly
quoted
,
Nicholas
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
a
cold
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
perfectly
remember
it
.
<EOS>
Master
Potts
seems
to
have
the
'
Dæmonologie
'
at
his
fingers
'
ends
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
it
my
study
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
lawyer
,
somewhat
mollified
by
the
remark
,
"
as
I
have
the
statute
on
witchcraft
,
and
indeed
most
other
statutes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
wasted
time
enough
in
this
unprofitable
talk
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
abruptly
quitting
them
without
bestowing
the
slightest
salutation
on
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
but
jesting
in
what
I
said
just
now
,
good
Master
Nicholas
,
"
observed
the
little
lawyer
,
nowise
disconcerted
at
the
slight
"
though
they
were
the
king
's
exact
words
I
quoted
.
<EOS>
No
one
would
suspect
you
of
being
a
wizard
--
ha!--ha
!
<EOS>
But
I
am
resolved
to
prosecute
the
search
,
and
I
calculate
upon
your
aid
,
and
that
of
Master
Richard
Assheton
,
who
goes
with
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
mine
,
at
all
events
,
Master
Potts
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
and
I
doubt
not
,
my
cousin
Dick
's
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Our
May
Queen
,
Alizon
Device
,
is
Mother
Demdike
's
grand
-
daughter
,
is
she
not
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Potts
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
why
do
you
ask
?
"
demanded
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
a
good
and
sufficing
reason
,
"
replied
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
She
might
be
an
important
witness
;
for
,
as
King
James
saith
,
'
bairns
or
wives
may
,
of
our
law
,
serve
for
sufficient
witnesses
and
proofs
.
'
<EOS>
And
he
goeth
on
to
say
,
'
For
who
but
witches
can
be
proofs
,
and
so
witnesses
of
the
doings
of
witches
?
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to
aver
that
Alizon
Device
is
a
witch
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
aver
nothing
,
"
replied
Potts
;
"
but
,
<EOS>
as
a
relative
of
a
suspected
witch
,
she
will
be
the
best
witness
against
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
design
to
meddle
with
Alizon
Device
,
expect
no
assistance
from
me
,
Master
Potts
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
sternly
,
"
but
rather
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
but
threw
out
the
hint
,
good
Master
Nicholas
,
"
replied
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Another
witness
will
do
equally
well
.
<EOS>
There
are
other
children
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
rely
on
you
,
sir
--
I
rely
on
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
go
in
search
of
Master
Nowell
,
and
obtain
the
warrant
and
the
constable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
shall
go
keep
my
appointment
with
Parson
Dewhurst
,
at
the
Abbey
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
bowing
slightly
to
the
attorney
,
and
taking
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
do
to
alarm
him
at
present
,
"
said
Potts
,
looking
after
him
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
'll
have
that
girl
as
a
witness
,
and
I
know
how
to
terrify
her
into
compliance
.
<EOS>
A
singular
woman
,
that
Mistress
Alice
Nutter
.
<EOS>
I
must
inquire
into
her
history
.
<EOS>
Odd
,
how
obstinately
she
set
her
face
against
witchcraft
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
lives
at
Rough
Lee
,
<EOS>
in
the
very
heart
of
a
witch
district
,
for
such
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
calls
this
Pendle
Forest
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
she
has
dealings
with
the
old
hags
she
defends
--
Mother
Demdike
and
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
Chattox
!
<EOS>
Lord
bless
us
,
what
a
name!--There
's
caldron
and
broomstick
in
the
very
sound
!
<EOS>
And
Demdike
is
little
better
.
<EOS>
Both
seem
of
diabolical
invention
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
unearth
a
pack
of
witches
,
I
shall
gain
much
credit
from
my
honourable
good
lords
the
judges
of
assize
in
these
northern
parts
,
besides
pleasing
the
King
himself
,
who
is
sure
to
hear
of
it
,
and
reward
my
praiseworthy
zeal
.
<EOS>
Look
to
yourself
,
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
take
care
<EOS>
you
are
not
caught
tripping
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
for
Master
Roger
Nowell
.
"
 
With
this
,
he
peered
about
among
the
crowd
in
search
of
the
magistrate
,
but
though
he
thrust
his
little
turned
-
up
nose
in
every
direction
,
he
could
not
find
him
,
and
therefore
set
out
for
the
Abbey
,
concluding
he
had
gone
thither
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mistress
Nutter
walked
along
,
she
perceived
James
Device
among
the
crowd
,
holding
Jennet
by
the
hand
,
and
motioned
him
to
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
Jem
instantly
understood
the
sign
,
and
quitting
his
little
sister
,
drew
near
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
thy
mother
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
in
a
tone
calculated
only
for
his
hearing
,
"
to
come
to
me
,
at
the
Abbey
,
quickly
and
secretly
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
in
the
ruins
of
the
old
convent
church
.
<EOS>
I
have
somewhat
to
say
to
her
,
that
concerns
herself
as
well
as
me
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
have
to
go
to
Rough
Lee
and
Malkin
Tower
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Jem
nodded
,
to
show
his
perfect
apprehension
of
what
was
said
and
his
assent
to
it
,
and
while
Mistress
Nutter
moved
on
with
a
slow
and
dignified
step
,
he
returned
to
Jennet
,
and
told
her
she
must
go
home
directly
,
a
piece
of
intelligence
which
was
not
received
very
graciously
by
the
little
maiden
;
but
nothing
heeding
her
unwillingness
,
Jem
walked
her
off
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
;
but
while
on
the
way
to
it
,
they
accidentally
encountered
their
mother
,
Elizabeth
Device
,
and
therefore
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo

Jem
,
with
a

<EOS>
And
as
he
and
his
little
sister
pursued
their
way
to
the
cottage
,
Elizabeth
hobbled
off
towards
the
Abbey
,
muttering
,
as
she
went
,
"
I

"
 
<EOS>
And
muttering
in
this
way
,
she
passed
through
the
Abbey
gateway
,
the
wicket
being
left
open
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
ruinous
convent
church
,
taking
care
as
much
as
possible
to
avoid
observation

CHAPTER
V.--MOTHER
CHATTOX
.
  
<EOS>
Not
far
from
the
green
where
the
May
-
day
revels
were
held
,
stood
the
ancient
parish
church
of
Whalley
,
its
square
tower
surmounted
with
a
flag
-
staff
and
banner
,
and
shaking
with
the
joyous
peals
of
the
ringers
.
<EOS>
A
picturesque
and
beautiful
structure
<EOS>
it
was
,
though
full
of
architectural
incongruities
;
and
its
grey
walls
and
hoary
buttresses
,
with
the
lancet
-
shaped
windows
of
the
choir
,
and
the
ramified
tracery
of
the
fine
eastern
window
,
could
not
fail
to
please
any
taste
not
quite
so
critical
as
to
require
absolute
harmony
and
perfection
in
a
building
.
<EOS>
Parts
of
the
venerable
fabric
were
older
than
the
Abbey
itself
,
dating
back
as
far
as
the
eleventh
century
,
when
a
chapel
occupied
the
site
;
and
though
many
alterations
had
been
made
in
the
subsequent
structure
at
various
times
,
and
many
beauties
destroyed
,
especially
during
the
period
of
the
Reformation
,
enough
of
its
pristine
character
remained
to
render
it
a
very
good
specimen
of
an
old
country
church
.
<EOS>
Internally
,
the
cylindrical
columns
of
the
north
aisle
,
the
construction
of
the
choir
,
and
the
three
stone
seats
supported
on
rounded
columns
near
the
altar
,
proclaimed
its
high
antiquity
.
<EOS>
Within
the
choir
were
preserved
the
eighteen
richly
-
carved
stalls
once
occupying
a
similar
position
in
the
desecrated
conventual
church
:
and
though
exquisite
in
themselves
,
they
seemed
here
sadly
out
of
place
,
not
being
proportionate
to
the
structure
.
<EOS>
Their
elaborately
-
carved
seats
projected
far
into
the
body
of
the
church
,
and
their
crocketed
pinnacles
shot
up
almost
to
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
well
<EOS>
they
had
not
shared
the
destruction
in
which
almost
all
the
other
ornaments
of
the
magnificent
fane
they
once
decorated
were
involved
.
<EOS>
Carefully
preserved
,
the
black
varnished
oak
well
displayed
the
quaint
and
grotesque
designs
with
which
many
of
them
--
the
Prior
's
stall
in
especial
--
were
embellished
.
<EOS>
Chief
among
them
was
the
abbot
's
stall
,
festooned
with
sculptured
vine
wreaths
and
clustering
grapes
,
and
bearing
the
auspicious
inscription
:
           
<EOS>
Semper
gaudentes
sint
ista
sede
sedentes
:
 
singularly
inapplicable
,
however
,
to
the
last
prelate
who
filled
it
.
<EOS>
Some
fine
old
monuments
,
and
warlike
trophies
of
neighbouring
wealthy
families
,
adorned
the
walls
,
and
within
the
nave
was
a
magnificent
pew
,
with
a
canopy
and
pillars
of
elaborately
-
carved
oak
,
and
lattice
-
work
at
the
sides
,
allotted
to
the
manor
of
Read
,
and
recently
erected
by
Roger
Nowell
;
while
in
the
north
and
south
aisles
were
two
small
chapels
,
converted
since
the
reformed
faith
had
obtained
,
into
pews
--
the
one
called
Saint
Mary
's
Cage
,
belonging
to
the
Assheton
family
;
and
the
other
appertaining
to
the
Catterals
of
Little
Mitton
,
and
designated
Saint
Nicholas
's
Cage
.
<EOS>
Under
the
last
-
named
chapel
were
interred
some
of
the
Paslews
of
Wiswall
,
and
here
lay
the
last
unfortunate
Abbot
of
Whalley
,
between
whoso
grave
,
and
the
Assheton
and
Braddyll
families
,
a
fatal
relation
was
supposed
to
subsist
.
<EOS>
Another
large
pew
,
allotted
to
the
Towneleys
,
and
designated
Saint
Anthony
's
Cage
,
was
rendered
remarkable
,
by
a
characteristic
speech
of
Sir
John
Towneley
,
which
gave
much
offence
to
the
neighbouring
dames
.
<EOS>
Called
upon
to
decide
as
to
the
position
of
the
sittings
in
the
church
,
the
discourteous
knight
made
choice
of
Saint
Anthony
's
Cage
,
already
mentioned
,
declaring
,
"
My
man
,
Shuttleworth
of
Hacking
,
made
this
form
,
and
here
will
I
sit
when
I
come
;
and
my
cousin
Nowell
may
make
a
seat
behind
me
if
he
please
,
and
my
son
Sherburne
shall
make
one
on
the
other
side
,
and
Master
Catteral
another
behind
him
,
and
for
the
residue
the
use
shall
be
,
first
come
first
speed
,
and
that
will
make
the
proud
wives
of
Whalley
rise
betimes
to
come
to
church
.
<EOS>
"
One
can
fancy
the
rough
knight
's
chuckle
,
as
he
addressed
these
words
to
the
old
clerk
,
certain
of
their
being
quickly
repeated
to
the
"
proud
wives
"
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
Within
the
churchyard
grew
two
fine
old
yew
-
trees
,
now
long
since
decayed
and
gone
,
but
then
spreading
their
dark
-
green
arms
over
the
little
turf
-
covered
graves
.
<EOS>
Reared
against
the
buttresses
of
the
church
was
an
old
stone
coffin
,
together
with
a
fragment
of
a
curious
monumental
effigy
,
likewise
of
stone
;
but
the
most
striking
objects
in
the
place
,
and
deservedly
ranked
amongst
the
wonders
of
Whalley
,
were
three
remarkable
obelisk
-
shaped
crosses
,
set
in
a
line
upon
pedestals
,
covered
with
singular
devices
in
fretwork
,
and
all
three
differing
in
size
and
design
.
<EOS>
Evidently
of
remotest
antiquity
,
these
crosses
were
traditionally
assigned
to
Paullinus
,
who
,
according
to
the
Venerable
Bede
,
first
preached
the
Gospel
in
these
parts
,
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventh
century
;
but
other
legends
were
attached
to
them
by
the
vulgar
,
and
dim
mystery
brooded
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
Vestiges
of
another
people
and
another
faith
were
likewise
here
discernible
,
for
where
the
Saxon
forefathers
of
the
village
prayed
and
slumbered
in
death
,
the
Roman
invaders
of
the
isle
had
trodden
,
and
perchance
performed
their
religious
rites
;
some
traces
of
an
encampment
being
found
in
the
churchyard
by
the
historian
of
the
spot
,
while
the
north
boundary
of
the
hallowed
precincts
was
formed
by
a
deep
foss
,
once
encompassing
the
nigh
-
obliterated
fortification
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
records
of
an
elder
people
,
there
was
another
memento
of
bygone
days
and
creeds
,
in
a
little
hermitage
and
chapel
adjoining
it
,
founded
in
the
reign
of
Edward
III
.
,
by
Henry
,
Duke
of
Lancaster
,
for
the
support
of
two
recluses
and
a
priest
to
say
masses
daily
for
him
and
his
descendants
;
but
this
pious
bequest
being
grievously
abused
in
the
subsequent
reign
of
Henry
VI
.
,
by
Isole
de
Heton
,
a
fair
widow
,
who
in
the
first
transports
of
grief
,
vowing
herself
to
heaven
,
took
up
her
abode
in
the
hermitage
,
and
led
a
very
disorderly
life
therein
,
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
Abbey
,
and
the
great
prejudice
of
the
morals
of
its
brethren
,
and
at
last
,
tired
even
of
the
slight
restraint
imposed
upon
her
,
fled
away
"
contrary
to
her
oath
and
profession
,
not
willing
,
nor
intending
to
be
restored
again
;
"
the
hermitage
was
dissolved
by
the
pious
monarch
,
and
masses
ordered
to
be
said
daily
in
the
parish
church
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
the
founder
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
legend
attached
to
the
little
cell
,
and
tradition
went
on
to
say
that
the
anchoress
broke
her
leg
in
crossing
Whalley
Nab
,
and
limped
ever
afterwards
;
a
just
judgment
on
such
a
heinous
offender
.
<EOS>
Both
these
little
structures
were
picturesque
objects
,
being
overgrown
with
ivy
and
woodbine
.
<EOS>
The
chapel
was
completely
in
ruins
,
while
the
cell
,
profaned
by
the
misdoings
of
the
dissolute
votaress
Isole
,
had
been
converted
into
a
cage
for
vagrants
and
offenders
,
and
made
secure
by
a
grated
window
,
and
a
strong
door
studded
with
broad
-
headed
nails
.
 
<EOS>
The
view
from
the
churchyard
,
embracing
the
vicarage
-
house
,
a
comfortable
residence
,
surrounded
by
a
large
walled
-
in
garden
,
well
stocked
with
fruit
-
trees
,
and
sheltered
by
a
fine
grove
of
rook
-
haunted
timber
,
extended
on
the
one
hand
over
the
village
,
and
on
the
other
over
the
Abbey
,
and
was
bounded
by
the
towering
and
well
-
wooded
heights
of
Whalley
Nab
.
<EOS>
On
the
side
of
the
Abbey
,
the
most
conspicuous
objects
were
the
great
north
-
eastern
gateway
,
with
the
ruined
conventual
church
.
<EOS>
Ever
beautiful
,
the
view
was
especially
so
on
the
present
occasion
,
from
the
animated
scene
combined
with
it
;
and
the
pleasant
prospect
was
enjoyed
by
a
large
assemblage
,
who
had
adjourned
thither
to
witness
the
concluding
part
of
the
festival
.
 
<EOS>
Within
the
green
and
flower
-
decked
bowers
which
,
as
has
before
been
mentioned
,
were
erected
in
the
churchyard
,
were
seated
Doctor
Ormerod
and
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
with
such
of
their
respective
guests
as
had
not
already
retired
,
including
Richard
and
Nicholas
Assheton
,
<EOS>
both
of
whom
had
returned
from
the
abbey
;
the
former
having
been
dismissed
by
Lady
Assheton
from
further
attendance
upon
Alizon
,
and
the
latter
having
concluded
his
discourse
with
Parson
Dewhurst
,
who
,
indeed
,
accompanied
him
to
the
church
,
and
was
now
placed
between
the
Vicar
and
the
Rector
of
Middleton
.
<EOS>
From
this
gentle
elevation
the
gay
company
on
the
green
could
be
fully
discerned
,
the
tall
May
-
pole
,
with
its
garlands
and
ribands
,
forming
a
pivot
,
about
which
the
throng
ever
revolved
,
while
stationary
amidst
the
moving
masses
,
the
rush
-
cart
reared
on
high
its
broad
green
back
,
as
if
to
resist
the
living
waves
constantly
dashed
against
it
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
a
new
kind
of
movement
was
perceptible
,
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
a
procession
was
being
formed
.
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
,
the
rush
-
cart
was
put
in
motion
,
and
winded
slowly
along
the
narrow
street
leading
to
the
church
,
preceded
by
the
morris
-
dancers
and
the
other
May
-
day
revellers
,
and
followed
by
a
great
concourse
of
people
,
shouting
,
dancing
,
and
singing
.
 
<EOS>
On
came
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
The
jingling
of
bells
,
and
the
sound
of
music
grew
louder
and
louder
,
and
the
procession
,
lost
for
awhile
behind
some
intervening
habitations
,
though
the
men
bestriding
the
rush
-
cart
could
be
discerned
over
their
summits
,
burst
suddenly
into
view
;
and
the
revellers
entering
the
churchyard
,
drew
up
on
either
side
of
the
little
path
leading
to
the
porch
,
while
the
rush
-
cart
coming
up
the
next
moment
,
stopped
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Then
four
young
maidens
dressed
in
white
,
and
having
baskets
in
their
hands
,
advanced
and
scattered
flowers
along
the
path
;
after
which
ladders
were
reared
against
the
sides
of
the
rush
-
cart
,
and
the
men
,
descending
from
their
exalted
position
,
bore
the
garlands
to
the
church
,
preceded
by
the
vicar
and
the
two
other
divines
,
and
followed
by
Robin
Hood
and
his
band
,
the
morris
-
dancers
,
and
a
troop
of
little
children
singing
a
hymn
.
<EOS>
The
next
step
was
to
unfasten
the
bundles
of
rushes
,
of
which
the
cart
was
composed
,
and
this
was
very
quickly
and
skilfully
performed
,
the
utmost
care
being
taken
of
the
trinkets
and
valuables
with
which
it
was
ornamented
.
<EOS>
These
were
gathered
together
in
baskets
and
conveyed
to
the
vestry
,
and
there
locked
up
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
bundles
of
rushes
were
taken
up
by
several
old
women
,
who
strewed
the
aisles
with
them
,
and
placed
such
as
had
been
tied
up
as
mats
in
the
pews
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
two
casks
of
ale
set
near
the
gate
,
and
given
for
the
occasion
by
the
vicar
,
were
broached
,
and
their
foaming
contents
freely
distributed
among
the
dancers
and
the
thirsty
crowd
.
<EOS>
Very
merry
were
they
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
in
consequence
,
but
their
mirth
was
happily
kept
within
due
limits
of
decorum
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
rush
-
cart
was
wellnigh
unladen
Richard
Assheton
entered
the
church
,
and
greatly
pleased
with
the
effect
of
the
flowery
garlands
with
which
the
various
pews
were
decorated
,
said
as
much
to
the
vicar
,
who
smilingly
replied
,
that
he
was
glad
to
find
he
approved
of
the
practice
,
"
even
though
it
might
savour
of
superstition
;
"
and
as
the
good
doctor
walked
away
,
being
called
forth
,
the
young
man
almost
unconsciously
turned
into
the
chapel
on
the
north
aisle
.
<EOS>
Here
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
gazing
round
the
church
,
wrapt
in
pleasing
meditation
,
in
which
many
objects
,
somewhat
foreign
to
the
place
and
time
,
passed
through
his
mind
,
when
,
chancing
to
look
down
,
he
saw
a
small
funeral
wreath
,
of
mingled
yew
and
cypress
,
lying
at
his
feet
,
and
a
slight
tremor
passed
over
his
frame
,
as
he
found
he
was
standing
on
the
ill
-
omened
grave
of
Abbot
Paslew
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
ask
himself
by
whom
this
sad
garland
had
been
so
deposited
,
Nicholas
Assheton
came
up
to
him
,
and
with
a
look
of
great
uneasiness
cried
,
"
Come
away
instantly
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
where
you
are
standing
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
grave
of
the
last
Abbot
of
Whalley
,
"
replied
Richard
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
forgotten
the
common
saying
,
"
cried
<EOS>
Nicholas--"that
the
Assheton
who
stands
on
that
unlucky
grave
shall
die
within
the
year
?
<EOS>
Come
away
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
,
"
replied
Richard
,
"
I
have
incurred
the
fate
,
if
such
a
fate
be
attached
to
the
tomb
;
and
as
my
moving
away
will
not
preserve
me
,
so
my
tarrying
here
can
not
injure
me
further
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
more
courage
than
I
possess
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
set
foot
on
that
accursed
stone
for
half
the
county
.
<EOS>
Its
malign
influence
on
our
house
has
been
approved
too
often
.
<EOS>
The
first
to
experience
the
fatal
destiny
were
Richard
Assheton
and
John
Braddyll
,
the
purchasers
of
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Both
met
here
together
on
the
anniversary
of
the
abbot
's
execution
--
some
forty
years
after
its
occurrence
,
it
is
true
,
and
when
they
were
both
pretty
well
stricken
in
years
--
and
within
that
year
,
namely
1578
,
both
died
,
and
were
buried
in
the
vault
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
church
,
not
many
paces
from
their
old
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
last
instance
was
my
poor
brother
Richard
,
who
,
being
incredulous
as
you
are
,
was
resolved
to
brave
the
destiny
,
and
stationed
himself
upon
the
tomb
during
divine
service
,
but
he
too
died
within
the
appointed
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
bewitched
to
death
--
so
,
at
least
,
it
is
affirmed
,
"
said
Richard
Assheton
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
believe
in
one
evil
influence
just
as
much
as
in
the
other
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
matters
not
how
the
destiny
be
accomplished
,
so
it
come
to
pass
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
,
turning
away
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
shield
you
from
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
said
Richard
,
picking
up
the
wreath
.
<EOS>
"
Who
,
think
you
,
can
have
placed
this
funeral
garland
on
the
abbot
's
grave
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
guess
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
,
staring
at
it
in
amazement--"an
enemy
of
ours
,
most
likely
.
<EOS>
It
is
neither
customary
nor
lawful
in
our
Protestant
country
so
to
ornament
graves
.
<EOS>
Put
it
down
,
Dick
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
displace
it
,
certainly
,
"
replied
Richard
,
laying
it
down
again
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
as
little
think
it
has
been
placed
here
by
a
hostile
hand
,
<EOS>
as
I
do
that
harm
will
ensue
to
me
from
standing
here
.
<EOS>
To
relieve
your
anxiety
,
however
,
I
will
come
forth
,
"
he
added
,
stepping
into
the
aisle
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
an
enemy
deposit
a
garland
on
the
abbot
's
tomb
,
since
it
was
by
mere
chance
that
it
hath
met
my
eyes
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mere
chance
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
;
"
every
thing
is
mere
chance
with
you
philosophers
.
<EOS>
There
is
more
than
chance
in
it
.
<EOS>
My
mind
misgives
me
strangely
.
<EOS>
That
terrible
old
Abbot
Paslew
is
as
troublesome
to
us
in
death
,
as
he
was
during
life
to
our
predecessor
,
Richard
Assheton
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
making
his
tombstone
a
weapon
of
destruction
to
us
,
he
pays
the
Abbey
itself
an
occasional
visit
,
and
his
appearance
always
betides
some
disaster
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
seen
him
myself
,
and
trust
I
never
shall
;
but
other
people
have
,
and
have
been
nigh
scared
out
of
their
senses
by
the
apparition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Idle
tales
,
the
invention
of
overheated
brains
,
"
rejoined
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Trust
me
,
the
abbot
's
rest
will
not
be
broken
till
the
day
when
all
shall
rise
from
their
tombs
;
though
if
ever
the
dead
(
supposing
such
a
thing
possible
)
could
be
justified
in
injuring
and
affrighting
the
living
,
it
might
be
in
his
case
,
since
he
mainly
owed
his
destruction
to
our
ancestor
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
principle
it
has
been
held
that
church
-
lands
are
unlucky
to
their
lay
possessors
;
but
see
how
this
superstitious
notion
has
been
disproved
in
our
own
family
,
to
whom
Whalley
Abbey
and
its
domains
have
brought
wealth
,
power
,
and
worldly
happiness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
something
in
the
notion
,
nevertheless
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
and
though
our
case
may
,
I
hope
,
continue
an
exception
to
the
rule
,
most
grantees
of
ecclesiastical
houses
have
found
them
a
curse
,
and
the
time
may
come
when
the
Abbey
may
prove
so
to
our
descendants
.
<EOS>
But
,
without
discussing
the
point
,
there
is
one
instance
in
which
the
malignant
influence
of
the
vindictive
abbot
has
undoubtedly
extended
long
after
his
death
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
,
I
suppose
,
that
he
pronounced
a
dreadful
anathema
upon
the
child
of
a
man
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
wizard
,
and
who
afterwards
acted
as
his
executioner
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
the
whole
particulars
of
the
dark
story
,
but
I
know
that
Paslew
fixed
a
curse
upon
the
child
,
declaring
it
should
become
a
witch
,
and
the
mother
of
witches
.
<EOS>
And
the
prediction
has
been
verified
.
<EOS>
Nigh
eighty
years
have
flown
by
since
then
,
and
the
infant
still
lives
--
a
fearful
and
mischievous
witch
--
and
all
her
family
are
similarly
fated
--
all
are
witches
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
the
story
before
,
"
said
Richard
,
somewhat
thoughtfully
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
guess
to
whom
you
allude
--
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
of
Pendle
Forest
,
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Precisely
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
they
are
a
brood
of
witches
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
Alizon
Device
must
be
a
witch
,
"
cried
Richard
;
"
and
I
think
you
will
hardly
venture
upon
such
an
assertion
after
what
you
have
seen
of
her
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
If
she
be
a
witch
,
I
would
there
were
many
such
--
as
fair
and
gentle
.
<EOS>
And
see
you
not
how
easily
the
matter
is
explained
?
'
<EOS>
Give
a
dog
an
ill
name
and
hang
him'--a
proverb
with
which
you
are
familiar
enough
.
<EOS>
So
with
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
Whether
really
uttered
or
not
,
the
abbot
's
curse
upon
her
and
her
issue
has
been
bruited
abroad
,
and
hence
she
is
made
a
witch
,
and
her
children
are
supposed
to
inherit
the
infamous
taint
.
<EOS>
So
it
is
with
yon
tomb
.
<EOS>
It
is
said
to
be
dangerous
to
our
family
,
and
dangerous
no
doubt
it
is
to
those
who
believe
in
the
saying
,
which
,
luckily
,
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
The
prophecy
works
its
own
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
The
absurdity
and
injustice
of
yielding
to
the
opinion
are
manifest
.
<EOS>
No
wrong
can
have
been
done
the
abbot
by
Mother
Demdike
,
any
more
than
by
her
children
,
and
yet
they
are
to
be
punished
for
the
misdeeds
of
their
predecessor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
just
as
you
and
I
,
who
are
of
the
third
and
fourth
generation
,
may
be
punished
for
the
sins
of
our
fathers
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
Scripture
against
you
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
I
see
in
favour
of
your
argument
is
,
the
instance
you
allege
of
Alizon
.
<EOS>
She
does
not
look
like
a
witch
,
certainly
;
but
there
is
no
saying
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
only
the
more
dangerous
for
her
rare
beauty
,
and
apparent
innocence
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
answer
for
her
truth
with
my
life
,
"
cried
Richard
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
look
at
her
countenance
,
in
which
candour
and
purity
shine
forth
,
and
doubt
her
goodness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
hath
cast
her
spells
over
you
,
Dick
,
that
is
certain
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
laughing
;
"
but
to
be
serious
.
<EOS>
Alizon
,
I
admit
,
is
an
exception
to
the
rest
of
the
family
,
but
that
only
strengthens
the
general
rule
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
remark
the
strange
look
they
all
--
save
the
fair
maid
in
question
--
<EOS>
have
about
the
eyes
?
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
answered
in
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
singular
,
and
I
wonder
you
have
not
noticed
it
,
"
pursued
Nicholas
;
"
but
the
question
of
reputed
witchcraft
in
Mother
Demdike
has
some
chance
of
being
speedily
settled
;
for
Master
Potts
,
the
little
London
lawyer
,
who
goes
with
us
to
Pendle
Forest
to
-
morrow
,
is
about
to
have
her
arrested
and
examined
before
a
magistrate
.
"
 
"
Indeed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Richard
,
"
this
must
be
prevented
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
so
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Nicholas
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
the
prejudice
existing
against
her
is
sure
to
convict
and
destroy
her
,
"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
great
age
,
infirmities
,
and
poverty
,
will
be
proofs
against
her
.
<EOS>
How
can
she
,
or
any
old
enfeebled
creature
like
her
,
whose
decrepitude
and
misery
should
move
compassion
rather
than
excite
fear
--
how
can
such
a
person
defend
herself
against
charges
easily
made
,
and
impossible
to
refute
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
deny
the
possibility
of
witchcraft
,
even
in
our
own
days
,
though
I
think
it
of
very
unlikely
occurrence
;
but
I
would
determinately
resist
giving
credit
to
any
tales
told
by
the
superstitious
vulgar
,
who
,
naturally
prone
to
cruelty
,
have
so
many
motives
for
revenging
imaginary
wrongs
.
<EOS>
It
is
placing
a
dreadful
weapon
in
their
hands
,
of
which
they
have
cunning
enough
to
know
the
use
,
but
neither
mercy
nor
justice
enough
to
restrain
them
from
using
it
.
<EOS>
Better
let
one
guilty
person
escape
,
than
many
innocent
perish
.
<EOS>
So
many
undefined
charges
have
been
brought
against
Mother
Demdike
,
that
at
last
they
have
fixed
a
stigma
on
her
name
,
and
made
her
an
object
of
dread
and
suspicion
.
<EOS>
She
is
endowed
with
mysterious
power
,
which
would
have
no
effect
if
not
believed
in
;
and
now
must
be
burned
because
she
is
called
a
witch
,
and
is
doting
and
vain
enough
to
accept
the
title
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
something
in
a
witch
difficult
,
nay
,
almost
impossible
to
describe
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
"
but
you
can
not
be
mistaken
about
her
.
<EOS>
By
her
general
ill
course
of
life
,
by
repeated
acts
of
mischief
,
and
by
threats
,
followed
by
the
consequences
menaced
,
she
becomes
known
.
<EOS>
There
is
much
mystery
in
the
matter
,
not
permitted
human
knowledge
entirely
to
penetrate
;
but
,
as
we
know
from
the
Scriptures
that
the
sin
of
witchcraft
did
exist
,
and
as
we
have
no
evidence
that
it
has
ceased
,
so
it
is
fair
to
conclude
,
that
there
may
be
practisers
of
the
dark
offence
in
our
own
days
,
and
such
I
hold
to
be
Mother
Demdike
and
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
Rival
potentates
in
evil
<EOS>
,
they
contend
which
shall
do
most
mischief
,
but
it
must
be
admitted
the
former
bears
away
the
bell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
all
the
ill
attributed
to
her
were
really
caused
by
her
machinations
,
this
might
be
correct
,
"
replied
Richard
,
"
but
it
only
shows
her
to
be
more
calumniated
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
cousin
Nicholas
,
I
look
upon
them
as
two
poor
old
creatures
,
who
,
persuaded
they
really
possess
the
supernatural
power
accorded
to
them
by
the
vulgar
,
strive
to
act
up
to
their
parts
,
and
are
mainly
assisted
in
doing
so
by
the
credulity
and
fears
of
their
audience
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Admitting
the
blind
credulity
of
the
multitude
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
"
and
their
proneness
to
discern
the
hand
of
the
witch
in
the
most
trifling
accidents
;
admitting
also
,
their
readiness
to
accuse
any
old
crone
unlucky
enough
to
offend
them
of
sorcery
<EOS>
;
I
still
believe
that
there
are
actual
practisers
of
the
black
art
,
who
,
for
a
brief
term
of
power
,
have
entered
into
a
league
with
Satan
,
worship
him
and
attend
his
sabbaths
,
and
have
a
familiar
,
in
the
shape
of
a
cat
,
dog
,
toad
,
or
mole
,
to
obey
their
behests
,
transform
themselves
into
various
shapes
--
as
a
hound
,
horse
,
or
hare,--raise
storms
of
wind
or
hail
,
maim
cattle
,
bewitch
and
slay
human
beings
,
and
ride
whither
they
will
on
broomsticks
.
<EOS>
But
,
holding
the
contrary
opinion
,
you
will
not
,
I
apprehend
,
aid
Master
Potts
in
his
quest
of
witches
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
"
rejoined
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
I
will
oppose
him
.
<EOS>
But
enough
of
this
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
forth
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
they
quitted
the
church
together
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
issued
into
the
churchyard
,
they
found
the
principal
arbours
occupied
by
the
morris
-
dancers
,
Robin
Hood
and
his
troop
,
Doctor
Ormerod
and
Sir
Ralph
having
retired
to
the
vicarage
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
Many
merry
groups
were
scattered
about
,
talking
,
laughing
,
and
singing
;
but
two
persons
,
seemingly
objects
of
suspicion
and
alarm
,
and
shunned
by
every
one
who
crossed
their
path
,
were
advancing
slowly
towards
the
three
crosses
of
Paullinus
,
which
stood
in
a
line
,
not
far
from
the
church
-
porch
.
<EOS>
They
were
females
,
one
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
very
comely
,
and
habited
in
smart
holiday
attire
,
put
on
with
considerable
rustic
coquetry
,
so
as
to
display
a
very
neat
foot
and
ankle
,
and
with
plenty
of
ribands
in
her
fine
chestnut
hair
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
a
very
different
person
,
far
advanced
in
years
,
bent
almost
double
,
palsy
-
stricken
,
her
arms
and
limbs
shaking
,
her
head
nodding
,
her
chin
wagging
,
her
snowy
locks
hanging
about
her
wrinkled
visage
,
her
brows
and
upper
lip
frore
,
and
her
eyes
almost
sightless
,
the
pupils
being
cased
with
a
thin
white
film
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
,
of
antiquated
make
and
faded
stuff
,
had
been
once
deep
red
in
colour
,
and
her
old
black
hat
was
high
-
crowned
and
broad
-
brimmed
.
<EOS>
She
partly
aided
herself
in
walking
with
a
crutch
-
handled
stick
,
and
partly
leaned
upon
her
younger
companion
for
support
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
is
one
of
the
old
women
we
have
just
been
speaking
of
--
Mother
Chattox
,
"
said
Richard
,
pointing
them
out
,
"
and
with
her
,
her
grand
-
daughter
,
pretty
Nan
Redferne
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
"
what
makes
the
old
hag
here
,
I
marvel
!
<EOS>
I
will
go
question
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
strode
quickly
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
now
,
Mother
Chattox
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
What
mischief
is
afoot
?
<EOS>
What
makes
the
darkness
-
loving
owl
abroad
in
the
glare
of
day
?
<EOS>
What
brings
the
grisly
she
-
wolf
from
her
forest
lair
?
<EOS>
Back
to
thy
den
,
old
witch
!
<EOS>
Ar't
crazed

as
well
as
blind
and
palsied
,
that
thou
knowest
not
that
this
is
a
merry

making
,
and
not
a
devil
's
sabbath

<EOS>
Back
to
thy
hut
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
These
sacred
precincts
are
no
place
for
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
speaks
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
old
hag
,
halting
,
and
fixing
her
glazed
eyes
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
thou
hast
much
injured
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
One
into
whose
house
thou
hast
brought
quick
-
wasting
sickness
and
death
by
thy
infernal
arts
.
<EOS>
One
thou
hast
good
reason
to
fear
;
for
learn
,
to
thy
confusion
,
thou
damned
and
murtherous
witch
,
it
is
Nicholas
,
brother
to
thy
victim
,
Richard
Assheton
of
Downham
,
who
speaks
to
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
none
I
have
reason
to
fear
,
"
replied
Mother
Chattox
;
"
<EOS>
especially
thee
,
Nicholas
Assheton
.
<EOS>
Thy
brother
was
no
victim
of
mine
.
<EOS>
Thou
wert
<EOS>
the
gainer
by
his
death

not
I.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
slay
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
thee
why
,
old
hag
,
"
cried
Nicholas
;
"
he
was
inflamed
by
the
beauty
of
thy
grand
-
daughter
Nancy
here
,
and
it
was
to
please
Tom
Redferne
,
her
sweetheart
then
,
but
her
spouse
<EOS>
since
,
that
thou
bewitchedst
him
to
death

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
reason
will
not
avail
thee
,
Nicholas
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Chattox
,
with
a
derisive
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
any
hand
in
his
death
,
it
was
to
serve
and
pleasure
thee

and
that
all
men
shall
know

if
I
am
questioned
on
the
subject

<EOS>
Take
me
to
the

Nance

"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
shalt
not

scape
thus

thou
murtherous
hag

cried
Nicholas
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
let
her
go
her
way
,
"
said
Richard
,
who
had
drawn
near
during
the
colloquy
.
<EOS>
"
No
good
will
come
of
meddling
with
her

"
 
<EOS>
"
Who

asked
Mother

quickly

Is
it
to
pray
to
Beelzebub
,
thy
master
,
that
thou
wouldst
go
to
the
crosses
?
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Out
of
my
way
,
pestilent
fool
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
shalt
not
stir
till
I
have
had
an
answer
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
They
say
those
are
Runic
obelisks
,
and
not
Christian
crosses
,
and
that
the
carvings
upon
them
have
a
magical
signification
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
it
is
averred
,
is
written
o'er
with
deadly
curses
,
and
the
forms
in
which
they
are
traced
,
as
serpentine
,
triangular
,
or
round
,
indicate
and
rule
their
swift
or
slow
effect
.
<EOS>
The
second
bears
charms
against
diseases
,
storms
,
and
lightning
.
<EOS>
And
on
the
third
is
inscribed
a
verse
which
will
render
him
who
can
read
it
rightly
,
invisible
to
mortal
view
.
<EOS>
Thou
shouldst
be
learned
in
such
lore
,
old
Pythoness
.
<EOS>
Is
it
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
hag
's
chin
wagged
fearfully
,
and
her
frame
trembled
with
passion
,
but
she
spoke
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
in
the
church
,
old
woman
?
"
<EOS>
interposed
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
wherefore
?
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
one
has
placed
a
cypress
wreath
on
Abbot
Paslew
's
grave
.
<EOS>
Was
it
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
hast
thou
found
it
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
It
shall
bring
thee
rare
luck
,
lad
--
<EOS>
rare
luck
.
<EOS>
Now
let
me
pass
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Not
yet
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
forcibly
grasping
her
withered
arm
.
 
<EOS>
The
hag
uttered
a
scream
of
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
Nicholas
Assheton
,
"
she
shrieked
,
"
or
thou
shalt
rue
it
.
<EOS>
Cramps
and
aches
shall
wring
and
rack
thy
flesh
and
bones
;
fever
shall
consume
thee
;
ague
shake
thee
--
shake
thee
--
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
Nicholas
recoiled
,
appalled
by
her
fearful
gestures
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
carry
your
malignity
too
far
,
old
woman
,
"
said
Richard
severely
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
thou
darest
tell
me
so
,
"
cried
the
hag
.
"
<EOS>
Set
me
before
him
,
Nance
,
that
I
may
curse
him
,
"
she
added
,
raising
her
palsied
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nah
,
nah
--
yo'n
cursed
ower
much
already
,
grandmother

"
cried
Nan
Redferne
,
endeavouring
to
drag
her
away
.
<EOS>
But
the
old
woman
resisted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
teach
him
to
cross
my
path
,
"
she
vociferated
,
in
accents
shrill
and
jarring
as
the
cry
of
the
goat
-
sucker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Handsome
he
is
,
it
may
be
,
now
,
but
he
shall
not
be
so
long
.
<EOS>
The
bloom
shall
fade
from
his
cheek
,
the
fire
be
extinguished
in
his
eyes
,
the
strength
depart
from
his
limbs
.
<EOS>
Sorrow
shall
be
her
portion
who
loves
him
--
sorrow
and
shame
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Horrible
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
,
endeavouring
to
exclude
the
voice
of
the
crone
,
which
pierced
his
ears
like
some
sharp
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
you
fear
me
now
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
By
this
,
and
this
,
the
spell
shall
work
,
"
she
added
,
describing
a
circle
in
the
air
with
her
stick
,
then
crossing
it
twice
,
and
finally
scattering
over
him
a
handful
of
grave
dust
,
snatched
from
an
adjoining
hillock
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
lead
me
quickly
to
the
smaller
cross
,
Nance
,
"
she
added
,
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
Her
grand
-
daughter
complied
,
with
a
glance
of
deep
commiseration
at
Richard
,
who
remained
stupefied
at
the
ominous
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
this
must
indeed
be
a
witch
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
recovering
from
the
momentary
shock
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
you
are
convinced
at
last
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
take
breath
now
<EOS>
the
old
hell
-
cat
is
gone
.
<EOS>
But
she
shall
not
escape
us
.
<EOS>
Keep
an
eye
upon
her
,
while
I
see
if
Simon
Sparshot
,
the
beadle
,
be
within
the
churchyard
,
and
if
so
he
shall
take
her
into
custody
,
and
lock
her
in
the
cage
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
ran
towards
the
throng
,
shouting
lustily
for
the
beadle
.
<EOS>
Presently
a
big
,
burly
fellow
,
in
a
scarlet
doublet
,
laced
with
gold
,
a
black
velvet
cap
trimmed
with
red
ribands
,
yellow
hose
,
and
shoes
with
great
roses
in
them
,
and
bearing
a
long
silver
-
headed
staff
,
answered
the
summons
,
and
upon
being
told
why
his
services
were
required
,
immediately
roared
out
at
the
top
of
a
stentorian
voice
,
"
A
witch
,
lads!--a
witch
!
"
 
<EOS>
All
was
astir
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Robin
Hood
and
his
merry
men
,
with
the
morris
-
dancers
,
rushed
out
of
their
bowers
,
and
the
whole
churchyard
was
in
agitation
.
<EOS>
Above
the
din
was
heard
the
loud
voice
of
Simon
Sparshot
,
still
shouting
,
"
A
witch!--witch!--Mother
Chattox
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
--
where
?
"
demanded
several
voices
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yonder
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
pointing
to
the
further
cross
.
 
<EOS>
A
general
movement
took
place
in
that
direction
,
the
crowd
being
headed
by
the
squire
and
the
beadle
,
but
when
they
came
up
,
they
found
only
Nan
Redferne
standing
behind
the
obelisk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
the
devil
is
the
old
witch
gone
,
Dick
?
"
cried
Nicholas
,
in
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
saw
her
standing
there
with
her
grand
-
daughter
,
"
replied
Richard
;
"
but
in
truth
I
did
not
watch
very
closely
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Search
for
her
--
search
for
her
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
But
neither
behind
the
crosses
,
nor
behind
any
monument
,
nor
in
any
hole
or
corner
,
nor
on
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
wall
,
nor
at
the
back
of
the
little
hermitage
or
chapel
,
though
all
were
quickly
examined
,
could
the
old
hag
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
On
being
questioned
,
Nan
Redferne
refused
to
say
aught
concerning
her
grandmother
's
flight
or
place
of
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
there
is
some
truth
in
that
strange
legend
of
the
cross
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
Notwithstanding
her
blindness
,
the
old
hag
must
have
managed
to
read
the
magic
verse
upon
it
,
and
so
have
rendered
herself
invisible
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
got
the
young
witch
safe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
,
squoire
!
"
<EOS>
responded
Sparshot
,
who
had
seized
hold
of
Nance--"hoo
be
safe
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nan
Redferne
is
no
witch
,
"
said
Richard
Assheton
,
authoritatively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw
witch
,
Mester
Ruchot
!
"
cried
the
beadle
in
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
than
any
of
these
lasses
around
us
,
"
said
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Release
her
,
Sparshot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
forbid
him
to
do
so
,
till
she
has
been
examined
,
"
cried
a
sharp
voice
.
<EOS>
And
the
next
moment
Master
Potts
was
seen
pushing
his
way
through
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
found
a
witch
,
my
masters
.
<EOS>
I
heard
your
shouts
,
and
hurried
on
as
fast
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
Just
in
time
,
Master
Nicholas
--
just
in
time
,
"
he
added
,
rubbing
his
hands
gleefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lemme
go
,
Simon
,
"
besought
Nance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw
,
neaw
,
lass
,
that
munnot
be
,
"
rejoined
Sparshot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help
--
save
me
,
Master
Richard
!
"
cried
the
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
crowd
had
gathered
round
her
,
yelling
,
hooting
,
and
shaking
their
hands
at
her
,
as
if
about
to
tear
her
in
pieces
;
but
Richard
Assheton
planted
himself
resolutely
before
her
,
and
pushed
back
the
foremost
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Remove
her
instantly
to
the
Abbey
,
Sparshot
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
let
her
be
kept
in
safe
custody
till
Sir
Ralph
has
time
to
examine
her
.
<EOS>
Will
that
content
you
,
masters
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw
--
neaw
,
"
responded
several
rough
voices
;
"
swim
her!--swim
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
my
worthy
friends
,
quite
right
,
"
said
Potts
.
"
<EOS>
_
Primo
_
,
let
us
make
sure
she
is
a
witch--_secundo
_
,
let
us
take
her
to
the
Abbey
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
her
being
a
witch
,
Master
Potts
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
her
old
grand
-
dame
,
Mother
Chattox
,
has
just
vanished
from
our
sight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
Mother
Chattox
been
here
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Potts
,
opening
his
round
eyes
to
their
widest
extent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
many
minutes
since
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
fact
,
she
may
be
here
still
for
aught
I
know
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here!--where
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Potts
,
looking
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
discover
her
for
all
your
quickness
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
rendered
herself
invisible
,
by
reciting
the
magical
verses
inscribed
on
that
cross
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
the
attorney
,
closely
examining
the
mysterious
inscriptions
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
strange
,
uncouth
characters
!
<EOS>
I
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
,
unless
it
be
the
devil
's
tail
,
of
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
whoop
was
raised
by
Jem
Device
,
who
,
having
taken
his
little
sister
home
,
had
returned
to
the
sports
on
the
green
,
and
now
formed
part
of
the
assemblage
in
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Between
the
rival
witch
potentates
,
Mothers
Demdike
and
Chattox
,
it
has
already
been
said
a
deadly
enmity
existed
,
and
the
feud
was
carried
on
with
equal
animosity
by
their
descendants
;
and
though
Jem
himself
came
under
the
same
suspicion
as
Nan
Redferne
,
that
circumstance
created
no
tie
of
interest
between
them
,
but
the
contrary
,
and
he
was
the
most
active
of
her
assailants
.
<EOS>
He
had
set
up
the
above
-
mentioned
cry
from
observing
a
large
rat
running
along
the
side
of
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
"
Theere
hoo
goes
,
<EOS>
"
whooped
Jem
,
"
t'owd
witch
,
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
shape
ov
a
rotten!--loo
-
loo
-
loo
!
"
 
<EOS>
Half
the
crowd
started
in
pursuit
of
the
animal
,
and
twenty
sticks
were
thrown
at
it
,
but
a
stone
cast
by
Jem
stayed
its
progress
,
and
it
was
instantly
despatched
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
change
,
however
,
as
was
expected
by
the
credulous
hinds
,
into
an
old
woman
,
and
they
gave
vent
to
their
disappointment
and
rage
in
renewed
threats
against
Nan
Redferne
.
<EOS>
The
dead
rat
was
hurled
at
her
by
Jem
,
but
missing
its
mark
,
it
hit
Master
Potts
on
the
head
,
and
nearly
knocked
him
off
the
cross
,
upon
which
he
had
mounted
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
the
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Irritated
by
this
circumstance
,
as
well
as
by
the
failure
of
the
experiment
,
the
little
attorney
jumped
down
and
fell
to
kicking
the
unfortunate
rat
,
after
which
,
his
fury
being
somewhat
appeased
,
he
turned
to
Nance
,
who
had
sunk
for
support
against
the
pedestal
,
and
said
to
her--"If
you
will
tell
us
what
has
become
of
the
old
witch
your
grandmother
,
and
undertake
to
bear
witness
against
her
,
you
shall
be
set
free
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'n
tell
ye
nowt
,

"
replied
Nance
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"
Put
me
to
onny
trial
ye
like
,
ye
shanna
get
a
word
fro
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
retorted
Potts
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
apprehend
we
shall
make
you
speak
,
and
pretty
plainly
too
,
before
we
've
done
with
you.--You
hear
what
this
perverse
and
wrong
-
headed
young
witch
declares
,
masters
,
"
he
shouted
,
again
clambering
upon
the
cross
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
offered
her
liberty
,
on
condition
of
disclosing
to
us
the
manner
of
her
diabolical
old
relative
's
evasion
,
and
she
rejects
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
An
angry
roar
followed
,
mixed
with
cries
from
Jem
Device
,
of
"
swim
her!--swim
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
tell
them
what
you
know
,
Nance
,
"
said
Richard
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
or
I
shall
have
difficulty
in
preserving
you
from
their
fury
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
darena
,
Master
Richard
,
"
she
replied
,
shaking
her
head
;
and
then
she
added
firmly
,
"
Ey
winna
.
"
 
<EOS>
Finding
it
useless
to
reason
with
her
,
and
fearing
also
that
the
infuriated
crowd
might
attempt
to
put
their
threats
into
execution
,
Richard
turned
to
his
cousin
Nicholas
,
and
said
:
"
We
must
get
her
away
,
or
violence
will
be
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
does
not
deserve
your
compassion
,
Dick
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
she
is
only
a
few
degrees
better
than
the
old
hag

escaped

<EOS>
Sparshot

<EOS>
cried
Nance
;
regarding
him
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
head
were
off
,
Simon
,
I
do
n't
see
how
the
likeness
to
my
poor
brother
could
well
be
recognised
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
with
a
half
smile
.
<EOS>
"
But
let
her
be
put
to
some
mild
trial
--
weighed
against
the
church
Bible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
replied
Potts
,
jumping
down
;
"
but
if
that
fail
,
we
must
have
recourse
to
stronger
measures
.
<EOS>
Take
notice
that
,
with
all
her
fright
,
she
has
not
been
able
to
shed
a
tear
,
not
a
single
tear
--
a
clear
witch
--
a
clear
witch
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'd

to
weep

"
<EOS>
cried
Nance
,
disdainfully
,
having
now
completely
recovered
her
natural
audacity
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
soon
break
your
spirit
,
young
woman
,
I
can
promise
you
,
"
rejoined
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
it
was
known
what
was
about
to
occur
,
the
whole
crowd
moved
towards
the
church
porch
,
Nan
Redferne
walking
between
Richard
Assheton
and
the
beadle
,
who
kept
hold
of
her
arm
to
prevent
any
attempt
at
escape
;
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
appointed
place
,
Ben
Baggiley
,
the
baker
,
who
had
been
despatched
for
the
purpose
,
appeared
with
an
enormous
pair
of
wooden
scales
,
while
Sampson
Harrop
,
the
clerk
,
having
visited
the
pulpit
,
came
forth
with
the
church
Bible
,
an
immense
volume
,
bound
in
black
,
with
great
silver
clasps
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
that
's
a
good
big
Bible
at
all
events
,
"
cried
Potts
,
eyeing
it
with
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
It
looks
like
my
honourable
and
singular
good
Lord
Chief
-
Justice
Sir
Edward
Coke
's
learned
'
Institutes
of
the
Laws
of
England
,
'
only
that
that
great
legal
tome
is
generally
bound
in
calf
--
law
calf
,
as
we
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Large
as
the
book
is
,
it
will
scarce
prove
heavy
enough
to
weigh
down
the
witch
<EOS>
,
I
opine
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
sir
,
"
replied
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
scales
having
been
affixed
to
a
hook
in
the
porch
by
Baggiley
,
the
sacred
volume
was
placed
on
one
side
,
and
Nance
set
down
by
the
beadle
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
the
experiment
was
precisely
what
might
have
been
anticipated
--
the
moment
the
young
woman
took
her
place
in
the
balance
,
it
sank
down
to
the
ground
,
while
the
other
kicked
the
beam
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
satisfied
now
,
Master
Potts
,
"
cried
Richard
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
By
your
own
trial
her
innocence
is
approved
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
pardon
,
Master
Richard
,
this
is
Squire
Nicholas
's
trial
,
not
mine

replied
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
for
the
ordeal
of
swimming

<EOS>
How
say
you

masters
!
<EOS>
Shall
we
be
content
with
this
doubtful
experiment
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw

responded
Jem
Device
,
who
acted
as
spokesman
to
the
crowd
,
"
<EOS>

!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
have
it
so

"
said
Potts
,
approvingly
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
a

place
for
the
trial

"
Th

"
The

said
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
Let

to
bind

"
 
<EOS>
"
Run

said
Jem
to
Baggiley
,
who
was
very
zealous
in
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
groaned
Nance
,
again
losing
courage
,
and
glancing
piteously
at
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
outrage
like
this
shall
be
perpetrated
,
"
cried
the
young
man
,
firmly
;
"
I
call
upon
you
,
cousin
Nicholas
,
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
Go
into
the
church
,
"
he
added
,
thrusting
Nance
backward
,
and
presenting
his
sword
at
the
breast
of
Jem
Device
,
who
attempted
to
follow
her
,
and
who
retired
muttering
threats
and
curses
;
"
I
will
run
the
first
man
through
the
body
who
attempts
to
pass
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Nan
Redferne
made
good
her
retreat
,
and
shut
the
church
-
door
after
her
,
Master
Potts
,
pale
with
rage
,
cried
out
to
Richard
,
"
You
have
aided
the
escape
of
a
desperate
and
notorious
offender
--
actually
in
custody
,

rendered
yourself
liable
to

it

<EOS>
Do

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
the
consequences
of
my
act
to
those
empowered
to
question
it

"
replied
Richard
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
have
given
you
notice
,
"
rejoined
Potts
,
"
due
notice

<EOS>
We
shall
hear
what
Sir
Ralph
will
say
to
the
matter

and
Master
Roger
Nowell
,
and--
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
forget
me
,
good
Master
Potts
,
"
interrupted
Nicholas
,
laughingly
;
"
I
entirely
disapprove
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
most
flagrant
breach
of
duty
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
am
glad
the
poor
wench
has
got
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
safe
within
the
church
,
"
said
Potts
,
"
and
I
command
Master
Richard
,
in
the
king
's
name
,
to
let
us
pass
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
Richard
put
an
end
to
further
altercation
,
by
stepping
back
quickly
,
locking
the
door
,
and
then
taking
out
the
key
,
and
putting
it
into
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
quite
safe
now
,
"
he
cried
,
with
a
smile
at
the
discomfited
lawyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
no
other
door
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Potts
of
the
beadle
,
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
,
theere

ot

"
replied
Sparshot
,
"

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quick
,
quick
,
and
let
's
see
,
"
cried
Potts
;
"
justice
must
not
be
thwarted
in
this
shameful
manner
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
the
greater
part
of
the
crowd
set
off
after
Potts
and
the
beadle
,
Richard
Assheton
,
anxious
to
know
what
had
become
of
the
fugitive
,
and
determined
not
to
abandon
her
while
any
danger
existed
,
unlocked
the
church
-
door
,
and
entered
the
holy
structure
,
followed
by
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
On
looking
around
,
Nance
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
,
neither
did
she
answer
to
his
repeated
calls
,
and
Richard
concluded
she
must
have
escaped
,
when
all
at
once
a
loud
exulting
shout
was
heard
without
,
leaving
no
doubt
that
the
poor
young
woman
had
again
fallen
into
the
hands
of
her
captors
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
a
sharp
,
piercing
scream
in
a
female
key
confirmed
the
supposition
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
cry
,
Richard
instantly
flew
to
the
opposite
door
,
through
which
Nance
must
have
passed
,
but
on
trying
it
he
found
it
fastened
outside
;
and
filled
with
sudden
misgiving
,
for
he
now
recollected
leaving
the
key
in
the
other
door
<EOS>
,
he
called
to
Nicholas
to
come
with
him
,
and
hurried
back
to
it
.
<EOS>
His
apprehensions
were
verified
;
the
door
was
locked
.
<EOS>
At
first
Nicholas
was
inclined
to
laugh
at
the
trick
played
them
;
but
a
single
look
from
Richard
checked
his
tendency
to
merriment
,
and
he
followed
his
young
relative
,
who
had
sprung
to
a
window
looking
upon
that
part
of
the
churchyard
whence
the
shouts
came
,
and
flung
it
open
.
<EOS>
Richard
's
egress
,
however
,
was
prevented
by
an
iron
bar
,
and
he
called
out
loudly
and
fiercely
to
the
beadle
,
whom
he
saw
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
,
to
unlock
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
a
little
patience
,
good
Master
Richard
,
"
replied
Potts
,
turning
up
his
provoking
little
visage
,
now
charged
with
triumphant
malice
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
come
out
presently
.
<EOS>
We
are
busy
just
now
--
engaged
in
binding
the
witch
,
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
Both
keys
are
safely
in
my
pocket
,
and
I
will
send
you
one
of
them
when
we
start
for
the
river
,
good
Master
Richard
.
<EOS>
We
lawyers
are
not
to
be
overreached
you
see
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
repent
this
conduct
when
I
do
get
out
,
"
cried
Richard
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sparshot
,
I
command
you
to
bring
the
key
instantly
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
encouraged
by
the
attorney
,
the
beadle
affected
not
to
hear
Richard
's
angry
vociferations
,
and
the
others
were
unable
to
aid
the
young
man
,
if
they
had
been
so
disposed
,
and
all
were
too
much
interested
in
what
was
going
forward
to
run
off
to
the
vicarage
,
and
acquaint
Sir
Ralph
with
the
circumstances
in
which
his
relatives
were
placed
,
even
though
enjoined
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
On
being
set
free
by
Richard
,
Nance
had
flown
quickly
through
the
church
,
and
passed
out
at
the
side
door
,
and
was
making
good
her
retreat
at
the
back
of
the
edifice
,
when
her
flying
figure
was
descried
by
Jem
Device
,
who
,
failing
in
his
first
attempt
,
had
run
round
that
way
,
fancying
he
should
catch
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
instantly
dashed
after
her
with
all
the
fury
of
a
bloodhound
,
and
,
being
possessed
of
remarkable
activity
,
speedily
overtook
her
,
and
,
heedless
of
her
threats
and
entreaties
,
secured
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lemme
go
,
Jem
,
"
she
cried
,
"
<EOS>
an
ey
win
do
thee
a
good
turn
one
<EOS>
o

these
days
,
when

i
'
th
'
same
strait
<EOS>
os

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
seeing
him
inexorable
,
she
added
,
"
My
granddame
shan
rack
thy
boans
sorely
,
lad
,
for
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jem
replied
by
a
coarse
laugh
of
defiance
,
and
,
dragging
her
along
,
delivered
her
to
Master
Potts
and
the
beadle
,
who
were
then
hurrying
to
the
other
door
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
To
prevent
interruption
,
the
cunning
attorney
,
having
ascertained
that
the
two
Asshetons
were
inside
,
instantly
gave
orders
to
have
both
doors
locked
,
and
the
injunctions
being
promptly
obeyed
,
he
took
possession
of
the
keys
himself
,
chuckling
at
the
success
of
the
stratagem
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
fair
reprisal
<EOS>
,
"
he
muttered
;
"
this
young
milksop
shall
find
he
is
no
match
for
a
skilful
lawyer
like
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
cords
--
the
cords
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
sight
of
the
bonds
,
which
were
quickly
brought
by
Baggiley
,
that
Nance
uttered
the
piercing
cry
that
had
roused
Richard
's
indignation
.
<EOS>
Feeling
secure
of
his
prisoner
,
and
now
no
longer
apprehensive
of
interruption
,
Master
Potts
was
in
no
hurry
to
conclude
the
arrangements
,
but
rather
prolonged
them
to
exasperate
Richard
.
<EOS>
Little
consideration
was
shown
the
unfortunate
captive
.
<EOS>
The
new
shoes
and
stockings
of
which
she
had
been
so
vain
a
short
time
before
,
were
torn
from
her
feet
and
limbs
by
the
rude
hands
of
the
remorseless
Jem
and
the
beadle
,
and
bent
down
by
the
main
force
of
these
two
strong
men
,
her
thumbs
and
great
toes
were
tightly
bound
together
,
crosswise
,
by
the
cords
.
<EOS>
The
churchyard
rang
with
her
shrieks
,
and
,
with
his
blood
boiling
with
indignation
at
the
sight
,
Richard
redoubled
his
exertions
to
burst
through
the
window
and
fly
to
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
But
though
Nicholas
now
lent
his
powerful
aid
to
the
task
,
their
combined
efforts
to
obtain
liberation
were
unavailing
;
and
with
rage
almost
amounting
to
frenzy
,
Richard
beheld
the
poor
young
woman
borne
shrieking
away
by
her
captors
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
Nicholas
much
less
incensed
,
and
he
swore
a
deep
oath
when
he
did
get
at
liberty
that
Master
Potts
should
pay
dearly
for
his
rascally
conduct
.

CHAPTER
VI.--THE
ORDEAL
BY
SWIMMING
.
  
<EOS>
Bound
hand
and
foot
in
the
painful
posture
before
described
,
roughly
and
insolently
handled
on
all
sides
,
in
peril
of
her
life
from
the
frightful
ordeal
to
which
she
was
about
to
be
subjected
,
the
miserable
captive
was
borne
along
on
the
shoulders
of
Jem
Device
and
Sparshot
,
her
long
,
fine
chestnut
hair
trailing
upon
the
ground
,
her
white
shoulders
exposed
to
the
insolent
gaze
of
the
crowd
,
and
her
trim
holiday
attire
torn
to
rags
by
the
rough
treatment
she
had
experienced
.
<EOS>
Nance
Redferne
,
it
has
been
said
,
was
a
very
comely
young
woman
;
but
neither
her
beauty
,
her
youth
,
nor
her
sex
,
had
any
effect
upon
the
ferocious
crowd
,
who
were
too
much
accustomed
to
such
brutal
and
debasing
exhibitions
,
to
feel
any
thing
but
savage
delight
in
the
spectacle
of
a
fellow
-
creature
so
scandalously
treated
and
tormented
,
and
the
only
excuse
to
be
offered
for
their
barbarity
,
is
the
firm
belief
they
entertained
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
witch
.
<EOS>
And
when
even
in
our
own
day
so
many
revolting
scenes
are
enacted
to
gratify
the
brutal
passions
of
the
mob
,
while
prize
-
fights
are
tolerated
,
and
wretched
animals
goaded
on
to
tear
each
other
in
pieces
,
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
,
in
times
of
less
enlightenment
and
refinement
,
greater
cruelties
should
be
practised
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
may
be
well
to
consider
how
far
we
have
really
advanced
in
civilisation
since
then
;
for
until
cruelty
,
whether
to
man
or
beast
,
be
wholly
banished
from
our
sports

we
can
not
justly
reproach
our
ancestors

or
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
improvement

<EOS>
Nance
's
cries
of
distress
were
only
answered
by
jeers
,
and
renewed
insults
,
and
wearied
out
at
length
,
the
poor
creature
ceased
struggling
and
shrieking
,
the
dogged
resolution
she
had
before
exhibited
again
coming
to
her
aid
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
fortitude
was
to
be
yet
more
severely
tested
.
<EOS>
Revealed
by
the
disorder
of
her
habiliments
,
and
contrasting
strongly
with
the
extreme
whiteness
of
her
skin
,
a
dun
-
coloured
mole
was
discovered
upon
her
breast
.
<EOS>
It
was
pointed
out
to
Potts
by
Jem
Device
,
who
declared
it
to
be
a
witch
-
mark
,
and
the
spot
where
her
familiar
drained
her
blood
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
one
of
the
'
good
helps
'
to
the
discovery
of
a
witch
,
pointed
out
by
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
,
"
said
the
attorney
,
narrowly
examining
the
spot
.
"
<EOS>
'
The
one
,
'
saith
our
wise
prince
,
'
is
the
finding
of
their
mark
,
and
the
trying
the
insensibleness
thereof
.
<EOS>
The
other
is
their
fleeting
on
the
water
.
'
<EOS>
The
water
-
ordeal
will
come
presently
,
but
the
insensibility
of
the
mark
might
be
at
once
attested
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
,
that
con
soon
be
tried
,
"
cried
Jem
,
with
a
savage
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
And
taking
a
pin
from
his
sleeve
,
the
ruffian
plunged
it
deeply
into
the
poor
creature
's
flesh
.
<EOS>
Nance
winced
,
but
she
set
her
teeth
hardly
,
and
repressed
the
cry
that
must
otherwise
have
been
wrung
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
clear
witch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jem
,
drawing
forth
the
pin
;
"
not
a
drop
<EOS>
o
'
blood
flows
,
an
hoo
feels
nowt

"
 
<EOS>
"
Feel

"
rejoined
Nance
,
between
her
ground
teeth
.
"
<EOS>
May

"
 
<EOS>
After
this
barbarous
test
,
the
crowd
,
confirmed
by
it
in
their
notions
of
Nan
's
guiltiness
,
hurried
on
,
their
numbers
increasing
as
they
proceeded
along
the
main
street
of
the
village
leading
towards
the
river
;
all
the
villagers
left
at
home
rushing
forth
on
hearing
a
witch
<EOS>
was
about
to
be
swum
,
and
when
they
came
within
a
bow
-
shot
of
the
stream
,
Sparshot
called
to
Baggiley
to
lay
hold
of
Nance
,
while
he
himself
,
accompanied
by
several
of
the
crowd
,
ran
over
the
bridge
,
the
part
he
had
to
enact
requiring
him
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
main
party
turned
down
a
little
footpath
protected
by
a
gate
on
the
left
,
which
led
between
garden
hedges
to
the
grassy
banks
of
the
Calder
,
and
in
taking
this
course
they
passed
by
the
cottage
of
Elizabeth
Device
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
shouts
of
the
rabble
,
little
Jennet
,
who
had
been
in
no
very
happy
frame
of
mind
since
she
had
been
brought
home
,
came
forth
,
and
seeing
her
brother
,
called
out
to
him
,
in
her
usual
sharp
tones
,
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Jem
?
<EOS>
Who

"
 
<EOS>
"
A

replied
Jem
,
gruffly
.
"
<EOS>
Nance
Redferne

Mother

<EOS>
Come

"
 
<EOS>
Jennet
readily
complied
,
for
her
curiosity
was
aroused
,
and
she
shared
in
the
family
feelings
of
dislike
to
Mother
Chattox
and
her
descendants
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
Nance
Redferne

"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
keeping
close
to
her
brother
,
"
Ey'm

<EOS>

<EOS>
"

with

cried

looking
at
the
little
girl
,
"
So

"
 
<EOS>
"
A

;

"

Jem
,
in
a
tone
of
deep

.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

,
almost
fiercely

<EOS>
"
That
's
where

"
replied
Jennet
,
hiding
her
arm
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good!--very
good
!
"
<EOS>
observed
Potts
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
"
<EOS>
'
Who
but

can
be

'
<EOS>
saith
our
sagacious
sovereign
.
<EOS>
I
shall
make
something
of
this
girl
.
<EOS>
She
seems
a
remarkably
quick
child
--
remarkably
quick
--

!
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
party
having
gained
the
broad
flat
mead
through
which
the
Calder
flowed
,
took
their
way
quickly
towards
its
banks
,
the
spot
selected
for
the
ordeal
lying
about
fifty
yards
above
the
weir
,
where
the
current
,
ordinarily
rapid
,
was
checked
by
the
dam
,
offering
a
smooth
surface
,
with
considerable
depth
of
water
.
<EOS>
If
soft
natural
beauties
could
have
subdued
the
hearts
of
those
engaged
in
this
cruel
and
wicked
experiment
,
never
was
scene
better
calculated
for
the
purpose
than
that
under
contemplation
.
<EOS>
Through
a
lovely
green
valley
meandered
the
Calder
,
now
winding
round
some
verdant
knoll
,
now
washing
the
base
of
lofty
heights
feathered
with
timber
to
their
very
summits
,
now
lost
amid
thick
woods
,
and
only
discernible
at
intervals
by
a
glimmer
amongst
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Immediately
in
front
of
the
assemblage
rose
Whalley
Nab
,
its
steep
sides
and
brow
partially
covered
with
timber
,
with
green
patches
in
the
uplands
where
sheep
and
cattle
fed
.
<EOS>
Just
below
the
spot
where
the
crowd
were
collected
,
the
stream
,
here
of
some
width
,
passed
over
the
weir
,
and
swept
in
a
foaming
cascade
over
the
huge
stones
supporting
the
dam
,
giving
the
rushing
current
the
semblance
and
almost
the
beauty
of
a
natural
waterfall
.
<EOS>
Below
this
the
stream
ran
brawling
on
in
a
wider
,
but
shallower
channel
,
making
pleasant
music
as
it
went
,
and
leaving
many
dry
beds
of
sand
and
gravel
in
the
midst
;
while
a
hundred
yards
lower
down
,
it
was
crossed
by
the
arches
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Further
still
,
a
row
of
tall
cypresses
lined
the
bank
of
the
river
,
and
screened
that
part
of
the
Abbey
,
converted
into
a
residence
by
the
Asshetons
;
and
after
this
came
the
ruins
of
the
refectory
,
the
cloisters
,
the
dormitory
,
the
conventual
church
,
and
other
parts
of
the
venerable
structure
,
overshadowed
by
noble
lime
-
trees
and
elms
.
<EOS>
Lovelier
or
more
peaceful
scene
could
not
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
The
green
meads
,
the
bright
clear
stream
,
with
its
white
foaming
weir
,
the
woody
heights
reflected
in
the
glassy
waters
,
the
picturesque
old
bridge
,
and
the
dark
grey
ruins
beyond
it
,
all
might
have
engaged
the
attention
and
melted
the
heart
.
<EOS>
Then
the
hour
,
when
evening
was
coming
on
,
and
when
each
beautiful
object
,
deriving
new
beauty
from
the
medium
through
which
it
was
viewed
,
exercised
a
softening
influence
,
and
awakened
kindly
emotions
.
<EOS>
To
most
the
scene
was
familiar
,
and
therefore
could
have
no
charm
of
novelty
.
<EOS>
To
Potts
,
however
,
it
was
altogether
new
;
but
he
was
susceptible
of
few
gentle
impressions
,
and
neither
the
tender
beauty
of
the
evening
,
nor
the
wooing
loveliness
of
the
spot
,
awakened
any
responsive
emotion
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
He
was
dead
to
every
thing
except
the
ruthless
experiment
about
to
be
made
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
same
time
that
Jem
Device
and
his
party
reached
the
near
bank
of
the
stream
,
the
beadle
and
the
others
appeared
on
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
Little
was
said
,
but
instant
preparations
were
made
for
the
ordeal
.
<EOS>
Two
long
coils
of
rope
having
been
brought
by
Baggiley
,
one
of
them
was
made
fast
to
the
right
arm
of
the
victim
,
and
the
other
to
the
left
;
and
this
done
,
Jem
Device
,
shouting
to
Sparshot
to
look
out
,
flung
one
coil
of
rope
across
the
river
,
where
it
was
caught
with
much
dexterity
by
the
beadle
.
<EOS>
The
assemblage
then
spread
out
on
the
bank
,
while
Jem
,
taking
the
poor
young
woman
in
his
arms
,
who
neither
spoke
nor
struggled
,
but
held
her
breath
tightly
,
approached
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dunna
drown
her
,
Jem
,
"
said
Jennet
,
who
had
turned
very
pale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
quiet
,
wench
,
"
rejoined
Jem
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
And
without
bestowing
further
attention
upon
her
,
he
let
down
his
burden
carefully
into
the
water
;
and
this
achieved
,
he
called
out
to
the
beadle
,
who
drew
her
slowly
towards
him
,
while
Jem
guided
her
with
the
other
rope
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
watched
the
experiment
for
a
few
moments
in
profound
silence
,
but
as
the
poor
young
woman
,
who
had
now
reached
the
centre
of
the
stream
,
still
floated
,
being
supported
either
by
the
tension
of
the
cords
,
or
by
her
woollen
apparel
,
a
loud
shout
was
raised
that
she
could
not
sink
,
and
was
,
therefore
,
an
undeniable
witch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Steady
,
lads
--
steady
a
moment
,
"
cried
Potts
,
enchanted
with
the
success
of
the
experiment
;
"
leave
her
where
she
is
,
that
her
buoyancy
may
be
fully
attested
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
masters
,
"
he
cried
,
with
a
loud
voice
,
"
the
meaning
of
this
water
ordeal
.
<EOS>
Our
sovereign
lord
and
master
the
king
,
in
his
wisdom
,
hath
graciously
vouchsafed
to
explain
the
matter
thus
:
'
Water
,
'
he
saith
,
'
shall
refuse
to
receive
them
(
meaning
witches
,
of
course
)
in
her
bosom
,
that
have
shaken
off
their
sacred
water
of
baptism
,
and
wilfully
refused
the
benefit
thereof
.
'
<EOS>
It
is
manifest
,
you
see
,
that
this
diabolical
young
woman
hath
renounced
her
baptism
,
for
the
water
rejecteth
her
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Non
<EOS>
potest
mergi
_
,
as
Pliny
saith
.
<EOS>
She
floats
like
a
cork
,
or
as
if
the
clear
water
of
the
Calder
had
suddenly
become
like
the
slab
,
salt
waves
of
the
Dead
Sea
,
in
which
,
nothing
can
sink
.
<EOS>
You
behold
the
marvel
with
your
own
eyes
,
my
masters
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
"
rejoined
Baggiley
and
several
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hoo
be
a
witch
fo
sartin
,
"
cried
Jem
Device
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
spoke
,
chancing
slightly
to
slacken
the
rope
,
the
tension
of
which
maintained
the
equilibrium
of
the
body
,
the
poor
woman
instantly
sank
.
 
<EOS>
A
groan
,
as
much
of
disappointment
as
sympathy
,
broke
from
the
spectators
,
but
none
attempted
to
aid
her
;
and
on
seeing
her
sink
,
Jem
abandoned
the
rope
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
But
assistance
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
rushed
quickly
and
furiously
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
They
were
Richard
and
Nicholas
Assheton
.
<EOS>
The
iron
bar
had
at
length
yielded
to
their
efforts
,
and
the
first
use
they
made
of
their
freedom
was
to
hurry
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
A
glance
showed
them
what
had
occurred
,
and
the
younger
Assheton
,
unhesitatingly
plunging
into
the
water
,
seized
the
rope
dropped
by
Jem
,
and
calling
to
the
beadle
to
let
go
his
hold
,
dragged
forth
the
poor
half
-
drowned
young
woman
,
and
placed
her
on
the
bank
,
hewing
asunder
the
cords
that
bound
her
hands
and
feet
with
his
sword
.
<EOS>
But
though
still
sensible
,
Nance
was
so
much
exhausted
by
the
shock
she
had
undergone
,
and
her
muscles
were
so
severely
strained
by
the
painful
and
unnatural
posture
to
which
she
had
been
compelled
,
that
she
was
wholly
unable
to
move
.
<EOS>
Her
thumbs
were
blackened
and
swollen
,
and
the
cords
had
cut
into
the
flesh
,
while
blood
trickled
down
from
the
puncture
in
her
breast
.
<EOS>
Fixing
a
look
of
inexpressible
gratitude
upon
her
preserver
,
she
made
an
effort
to
speak
,
but
the
exertion
was
too
great
;
violent
hysterical
sobbing
came
on
,
and
her
senses
soon
after
forsook
her
.
<EOS>
Richard
called
loudly
for
assistance
,
and
the
sentiments
of
the
most
humane
part
of
the
crowd
having
undergone
a
change
since
the
failure
of
the
ordeal
,
some
females
came
forward
,
and
took
steps
for
her
restoration
.
<EOS>
Sensibility
having
returned
,
a
cloak
was
wrapped
around
her
,
and
she
was
conveyed
to
a
neighbouring
cottage
and
put
to
bed
,
where
her
stiffened
limbs
were
chafed
and
warm
drinks
administered
,
and
it
began
to
be
hoped
that
no
serious
consequences
would
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
a
catastrophe
had
wellnigh
occurred
in
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
With
eyes
flashing
with
fury
,
Nicholas
Assheton
pushed
aside
the
crowd
,
and
made
his
way
to
the
bank
whereon
Master
Potts
stood
.
<EOS>
Not
liking
his
looks
,
the
little
attorney
would
have
taken
to
his
heels
,
but
finding
escape
impossible
,
he
called
upon
Baggiley
to
protect
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
instantly
in
the
forcible
gripe
of
the
squire
,
who
shouted
,
"
I
'll
teach
you
,
mongrel
hound
,
to
play
tricks
with
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Master
Nicholas
,
"
cried
the
terrified
and
half
-
strangled
attorney
,
"
my
very
good
sir
,
I
entreat
you
to
let
me
alone
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
breach
of
the
king
's
peace
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Assault
and
battery
,
under
aggravated
circumstances
,
and
punishable
with
ignominious
corporal
penalties
,
besides
fine
and
imprisonment
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
take
you
to
witness
the
assault
,
Master
Baggiley
.
<EOS>
I
shall
bring
my
ac
--
<EOS>
ac
--
ah
--
o

<EOS>
o
--
<EOS>
oh

"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
shall
have
something
to
bring
your
ac
--
<EOS>
ac
--
action
for
,
rascal
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
And
,
seizing
the
attorney
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
with
one
hand
,
and
the
hind
wings
of
his
doublet
with
the
other
,
he
cast
him
to
a
considerable
distance
into
the
river
,
where
he
fell
with
a
tremendous
splash
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
no
wizard
,
at
all
events
,
"
laughed
Nicholas
,
as
Potts
went
down
like
a
lump
of
lead
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
attorney
was
not
born
to
be
drowned
;
at
least
,
at
this
period
of
his
career
.
<EOS>
On
rising
to
the
surface
,
a
few
seconds
after
his
immersion
,
he
roared
lustily
for
help
,
but
would
infallibly
have
been
carried
over
the
weir
,
if
Jem
Device
had
not
flung
him
the
rope
now
disengaged
from
Nance
Redferne
,
and
which
he
succeeded
in
catching
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
was
dragged
out
;
and
as
he
crept
up
the
bank
,
with
the
wet
pouring
from
his
apparel
,
which
now
clung
tightly
to
his
lathy
limbs
,
he
was
greeted
by
the
jeers
of
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
like
you
the
water
-
ordeal
--
eh
,
Master
Attorney
?
<EOS>
No
occasion
for
a
second
trial
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
If
Jem
Device
had
known
his
own
interest
,
he
would
have
left
you
to
fatten
the
Calder
eels
;
but
he
will
find
it
out
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
it
out
too
,
Master
Nicholas
,
"
rejoined
Potts
,
clapping
on
his
wet
cap
.
<EOS>
"
Take
me
to
the
Dragon
quickly
,
good
fellow
,
"
he
added
,
to
Jem
Device
,
"
and
I
will
recompense
thee
for
thy
pains
,
as
well
as
for
the
service
thou
hast
just
rendered
me

<EOS>
I
shall
have
rheumatism
in
my
joints

pains
in
my
loins

and
rheum
in
my
head

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
oh

"
 
<EOS>
"
In
which
case
you
will
not
be
able
to
pay
Mother
Demdike
your
purposed
visit
to

morrow
,
"
jeered
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
You
forgot
you
were
to
arrest
her
,
and
bring
her
before
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thy

"
said
Potts
,
to
Jem
Device
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
fiend

thee

"
cried
Jem
,
shaking
him
off
roughly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
squoire

reet

<EOS>
Wouldee

"
 
<EOS>
"
What

have
you
changed
your
mind
already

Jem

"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
,
in
a
taunting
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
your

thanks
for

<EOS>
"
Fo

o

two
pins
<EOS>
ey'd
pitch

again

"
growled
Jem
,
eyeing
the
attorney
askance
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Jem
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
"
things
must
take
their
course
.
<EOS>
What
's
done
is
done
.
<EOS>
But
if
Master
Potts
be
wise
,
he
'll
take
himself
out
of
court
without
delay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
glad
to
get
me
out
of
court
one
of
these
days

squire
,
"
muttered
Potts
,
"
and
so
will
you
too
,
Master
James
Device.--A
day
of
reckoning
will
come
for
both
--
heavy
reckoning
.
<EOS>
Ugh
!
<EOS>
ugh

"
<EOS>
he
added
,
shivering
,
"
how
my
teeth
chatter
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Make
what
haste
you
can
to
the
Dragon
,
"
cried
the
good
-
natured
squire
;
"
get
your
clothes
dried
,
and
bid
John
Lawe
brew
you
a
pottle
of

swallow
it

hot

you

"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
before
me
either
,
"
retorted
Potts
,
"
Scalding
sack
!
<EOS>
This
bloodthirsty
squire
has
a
new
design
upon
my
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'n
go
wi
'
ye
to
th

said
Baggiley
;
"
lean
o

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thanke'e
friend

"
replied
Potts
,
taking
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
word
at
parting
,
Master
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
only
discovery
of
witchcraft
I
've
made
.
<EOS>
I
've
another
case

somewhat
nearer
home

<EOS>
Ha

ha

"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
hobbled
off
in
the
direction
of
the
alehouse
,
his
steps
being
traceable
along
the
dusty
road
like
the
course
of
a
watering
-
cart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'n
go
efter
him
,
"
growled
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
you
wo
n't
,
lad
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
"
and
if
you
'll
take
my
advice
,
you
'll
get
out
of
Whalley
as
fast
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
safer
on
the
heath
of
Pendle
than
here
,
when
Sir
Ralph
and
Master
Roger
Nowell
come
to
know
what
has
taken
place
.
<EOS>
And
mind
this
,
sirrah
--
the
hounds
will
be
out
in
the
forest
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
D'ye
heed
?
"
 
<EOS>
Jem
growled
something
in
reply
,
and
,
seizing
his
little
sister
's
hand
,
strode
off
with
her
towards
his
mother
's
dwelling
,
uttering
not
a
word
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Having
seen
Nance
Redferne
conveyed
to
the
cottage
,
as
before
mentioned
,
Richard
Assheton
,
regardless
of
the
wet
state
of
his
own
apparel
,
now
joined
his
cousin
,
the
squire
,
and
they
walked
to
the
Abbey
together
,
conversing
on
what
had
taken
place
,
while
the
crowd
dispersed
,
some
returning
to
the
bowers
in
the
churchyard
,
and
others
to
the
green
,
their
merriment
in
nowise
damped
by
the
recent
occurrences
,
which
they
looked
upon
as
part
of
the
day
's
sport
.
<EOS>
As
some
of
them
passed
by
,
laughing
,
singing
,
and
dancing
,
Richard
Assheton
remarked
,
"
I
can
scarcely
believe
these
to
be
the
same
people
I
so
lately
saw
in
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
They
then
seemed
totally
devoid
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
they
are
humane
enough
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
but
you
can
not
expect
them
to
show
mercy
to
a
witch
,
any
more
than
to
a
wolf
,
or
other
savage
and
devouring
beast
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
means
taken
to
prove
her
guilt
were
as
absurd
as
iniquitous
,
"
said
Richard
,
"
and
savour
of
the
barbarous
ages
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
perished
,
all
concerned
in
the
trial
would
have
been
guilty
of
murder
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
no
judge
would
condemn
them
,
"
returned
Nicholas
;
"
and
they
have
the
highest
authority
in
the
realm
to
uphold
them
.
<EOS>
As
to
leniency
to
witches
,
in
a
general
way
,
I
would
show
none
.
<EOS>
Traitors
alike
to
God
and
man
,
and
bond
slaves
of
Satan
,
they
are
out
of
the
pale
of
Christian
charity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
criminal
,
however
great
,
is
out
of
the
pale
of
Christian
charity
,
"
replied
Richard
;
"
but
such
scenes
as
we
have
just
witnessed
are
a
disgrace
to
humanity
,
and
a
mockery
of
justice
.
<EOS>
In
seeking
to
discover
and
punish
one
offence
,
a
greater
is
committed
.
<EOS>
Suppose
this
poor
young
woman
really
guilty
--
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
Our
laws
are
made
for
protection
,
as
well
as
punishment
of
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
should
he
arraigned
,
convicted
,
and
condemned
before
punishment
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Our
laws
admit
of
torture
,
Richard
,
"
observed
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
with
a
shudder
,
"
and
it
is
another
relic
of
a
ruthless
age
.
<EOS>
But
torture
is
only
allowed
under
the
eye
of
the
law
,
and
can
be
inflicted
by
none
but
its
sworn
servants
.
<EOS>
But
,
supposing
this
poor
young
woman
innocent
of
the
crime
imputed
to
her
,
which
I
really
believe
her
to
be
,
how
,
then
,
will
you
excuse
the
atrocities
to
which
she
has
been
subjected
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
her
innocent
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
her
relationship
to
a
notorious
witch
,
and
her
fabrication
of
clay
images
,
make
her
justly
suspected
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
let
her
be
examined
by
a
magistrate
,
"
said
Richard
;
"
but
,
even
then
,
woe
betide
her
!
<EOS>
When
I
think
that
Alizon
Device
is
liable
to
the
same
atrocious
treatment
,
in
consequence
of
her
relationship
to
Mother
Demdike
,
I
can
scarce
contain
my
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
unlucky
for
her
,
indeed
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
but
of
all
Nance
's
assailants
the
most
infuriated
<EOS>
was
Alizon
's
brother
,
Jem
Device
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
it
,
"
cried
Richard
--
an
uneasy
expression
passing
over
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
she
could
be
removed
from
that
family
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
what
purpose
?
"
demanded
Nicholas
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
family
are
more
likely
to
be
removed
from
her
if
Master
Potts
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
girl
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
fell
into
a
reverie
which
was
not
broken
till
they
reached
the
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
to
Jem
Device
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
cottage
,
the
ruffian
flung
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
for
a
time
seemed
lost
in
reflection
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
looked
up
,
and
said
gruffly
to
Jennet
,
who
stood
watching
him
,
"
See
if
mother
be
come
whoam
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Eigh

said
Elizabeth

,
opening
the
inner
door
and
coming
forth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So

<EOS>
Ey'm

"
 
<EOS>
Jem
gave
her
a
significant
look
,
upon
which
she
motioned
Jennet
to
withdraw
,
and
the
injunction
being
complied
with
,
though
with
evident
reluctance
,
by
the
little
girl
,
she
closed
the
door
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now

Jem
,
what
hast
got
to
say
to

demanded
Elizabeth

stepping

And

set

with

did
not
answer
in
words
,
but
her
significant
looks
were
quite
response
enough
for
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
Os
ye
win
,
mother
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
in
an
altered
tone
.
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
employed
in
eating
,
he
added
,
"
Did
Mistress
Nutter

questions

ye

"
 
<EOS>
"
More
nor

"
replied
Elizabeth
;
"
<EOS>
fo

<EOS>
She
praised
her

,
an
said

Except

"
interrupted
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
Except

"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
exclaimed
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
echoed
the
voice
that
had
previously
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
looked
at
his
mother
,
and
took
a
long
pull
at
the
ale
-
jug
.
 
<EOS>
"
Any
more
messages
to
Malkin
Tower
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
getting
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw
--
mother

onderstond
,
"
replied
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
Bid
her

on
her

,

"
 
<EOS>
"
Meanin

"
said
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
Meaning
Potts
,
"
answered
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
strange
echoes
here
,
"
said
Jem
,
looking
round
suspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Tib
came
from
under
a
piece
of
furniture
,
where
he
had
apparently
been
lying
,
and
rubbed
himself
familiarly
against
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
needna

afeerd
o
'
owt

"
said
Jem
,
patting
the
cat

back
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Eigh

<EOS>
,
"
replied
Elizabeth
,
bending
down
to
pat
him
,
"
he
's
a
trusty
cat
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
ill
-
tempered
animal
would
not
be
propitiated
,
but
erected
his
back
,
and
menaced
her
with
his
claws
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
han
offended
him
,

,
"
said
Jem
.
<EOS>
"
One
word
efore

<EOS>
Are

"
 
<EOS>
"
Why

"
<EOS>
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fro

<EOS>

to
Squoire
Nicholas

"
rejoined
Jem
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
he

<EOS>
Whot
<EOS>
could

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whot
,
indeed
?
"
cried
Elizabeth
,
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
Tib
,
"
exclaimed
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
cat
sprang
towards
the
inner
door
,
and
scratched
violently
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
immediately
raised
the
latch
,
and
found
Jennet
behind
it
,
with
a
face
like
scarlet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo'n
been
listenin
,
ye
young
eavesdropper
,
"
cried
Elizabeth
,
boxing
her
ears
soundly
;
"
take
that
fo

your
pains
--
an
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Touch
me
again
,
an
Mester
Potts

knoa
aw
ey'n

"
said
the
little
girl
,
repressing
her
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
regarded
her
angrily
;
but
the
looks
of
the
child
were
so
spiteful
,
that
she
did
not
dare
to
strike
her
.
<EOS>
She
glanced
too
at
Tib
;
but
the
uncertain
cat
was
now
rubbing
himself
in
the
most
friendly
manner
against
Jennet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
shan
pay
for
this
,
lass
,
presently
,
"
said
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Best
nah

"
rejoined
Jennet
in
a
determined
tone
;
"

<EOS>
Ey

"
 
<EOS>
"
How

"
cried
her
mother
,
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
Jennet
replied
with
a
mocking
laugh
,
while
Tib
rubbed
against
her
more
fondly
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let

"
interposed
Jem
.
"

<EOS>
So

"
<EOS>
And
with
this
,
he
put
on
his
cap
,
seized
his
cudgel
,
and
quitted
the
cottage

CHAPTER
VII.--THE
RUINED
CONVENTUAL
CHURCH
.
  
<EOS>
Beneath
a
wild
cherry
-
tree
,
planted
by
chance
in
the
Abbey
gardens
,
and
of
such
remarkable
size
that
it
almost
rivalled
the
elms
and
lime
trees
surrounding
it
,
and
when
in
bloom
resembled
an
enormous
garland
,
stood
two
young
maidens
,
both
of
rare
beauty
,
though
in
totally
different
styles;--the
one
being
fair
-
haired
and
blue
-
eyed
,
with
a
snowy
skin
tinged
with
delicate
bloom
,
like
that
of
roses
seen
through
milk
,
to
borrow
a
simile
from
old
Anacreon
;
while
the
other
far
eclipsed
her
in
the
brilliancy
of
her
complexion
,
the
dark
splendour
of
her
eyes
,
and
the
luxuriance
of
her
jetty
tresses
,
which
,
unbound
and
knotted
with
ribands
,
flowed
down
almost
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
In
age
,
there
was
little
disparity
between
them
,
though
perhaps
the
dark
-
haired
girl
might
be
a
year
nearer
twenty
than
the
other
,
and
somewhat
more
of
seriousness
,
though
not
much
,
sat
upon
her
lovely
countenance
than
on
the
other
's
laughing
features
.
<EOS>
Different
were
they
too
,
in
degree
,
and
here
social
position
was
infinitely
in
favour
of
the
fairer
girl
,
but
no
one
would
have
judged
it
so
if
not
previously
acquainted
with
their
history
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
rather
the
one
having
least
title
to
be
proud
(
<EOS>
if
any
one
has
such
title
)
who
now
seemed
to
look
up
to
her
companion
with
mingled
admiration
and
regard
;
the
latter
being
enthralled
at
the
moment
by
the
rich
notes
of
a
thrush
poured
from
a
neighbouring
lime
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Pleasant
was
the
garden
where
the
two
girls
stood
,
shaded
by
great
trees
,
laid
out
in
exquisite
parterres
,
with
knots
and
figures
,
quaint
flower
-
beds
,
shorn
trees
and
hedges
,
covered
alleys
and
arbours
,
terraces
and
mounds
,
in
the
taste
of
the
time
,
and
above
all
an
admirably
kept
bowling
-
green
.
<EOS>
It
was
bounded
on
the
one
hand
by
the
ruined
chapter
-
house
and
vestry
of
the
old
monastic
structure
,
and
on
the
other
by
the
stately
pile
of
buildings
formerly
making
part
of
the
Abbot
's
lodging
,
in
which
the
long
gallery
was
situated
,
some
of
its
windows
looking
upon
the
bowling
-
green
,
and
then
kept
in
excellent
condition
,
but
now
roofless
and
desolate
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
,
on
the
right
,
half
hidden
by
trees
,
lay
the
desecrated
and
despoiled
conventual
church
.
<EOS>
Reared
at
such
cost
,
and
with
so
much
magnificence
,
by
thirteen
abbots
--
the
great
work
having
been
commenced
,
as
heretofore
stated
,
by
Robert
de
Topcliffe
,
in
1330
,
and
only
completed
in
all
its
details
by
John
Paslew
;
this
splendid
structure
,
surpassing
,
according
to
Whitaker
,
"
many
cathedrals
in
extent
,
"
was
now
abandoned
to
the
slow
ravages
of
decay
.
<EOS>
Would
it
had
never
encountered
worse
enemy
!
<EOS>
But
some
half
century
later
,
the
hand
of
man
was
called
in
to
accelerate
its
destruction
,
and
it
was
then
almost
entirely
rased
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
At
the
period
in
question
though
partially
unroofed
,
and
with
some
of
the
walls
destroyed
,
it
was
still
beautiful
and
picturesque
--
<EOS>
more
picturesque
,
indeed
than
in
the
days
of
its
pride
and
splendour
.
<EOS>
The
tower
with
its
lofty
crocketed
spire
was
still
standing
,
though
the
latter
was
cracked
and
tottering
,
and
the
jackdaws
roosted
within
its
windows
and
belfry
.
<EOS>
Two
ranges
of
broken
columns
told
of
the
bygone
glories
of
the
aisles
;
and
the
beautiful
side
chapels
having
escaped
injury
better
than
other
parts
of
the
fabric
,
remained
in
tolerable
preservation
.
<EOS>
But
the
choir
and
high
altar
were
stripped
of
all
their
rich
carving
and
ornaments
,
and
the
rain
descended
through
the
open
rood
-
loft
upon
the
now
grass
-
grown
graves
of
the
abbots
in
the
presbytery
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
the
ramified
mullions
still
retained
their
wealth
of
painted
glass
,
and
the
grand
eastern
window
shone
gorgeously
as
of
yore
.
<EOS>
All
else
was
neglect
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
Briers
and
turf
usurped
the
place
of
the
marble
pavement
;
many
of
the
pillars
were
festooned
with
ivy
;
and
,
in
some
places
,
the
shattered
walls
were
covered
with
creepers
,
and
trees
had
taken
root
in
the
crevices
of
the
masonry
.
<EOS>
Beautiful
at
all
times
were
these
magnificent
ruins
;
but
never
so
beautiful
as
when
seen
by
the
witching
light
of
the
moon
--
the
hour
,
according
to
the
best
authority
,
when
all
ruins
should
be
viewed
--
when
the
long
lines
of
broken
pillars
,
the
mouldering
arches
,
and
the
still
glowing
panes
over
the
altar
,
had
a
magical
effect
.
 
<EOS>
In
front
of
the
maidens
stood
a
square
tower
,
part
of
the
defences
of
the
religious
establishment
,
erected
by
Abbot
Lyndelay
,
in
the
reign
of
Edward
III
.
,
but
disused
and
decaying
.
<EOS>
It
was
sustained
by
high
and
richly
groined
arches
,
crossing
the
swift
mill
-
race
,
and
faced
the
river
.
<EOS>
A
path
led
through
the
ruined
chapter
-
house
to
the
spacious
cloister
quadrangle
,
once
used
as
a
cemetery
for
the
monks
,
but
now
converted
into
a
kitchen
garden
,
its
broad
area
being
planted
out
,
and
fruit
-
trees
trained
against
the
hoary
walls
.
<EOS>
Little
of
the
old
refectory
was
left
,
except
the
dilapidated
stairs
once
conducting
to
the
gallery
where
the
brethren
were
wo
nt
to
take
their
meals
,
but
the
inner
wall
still
served
to
enclose
the
garden
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
Of
the
dormitory
,
formerly
constituting
the
eastern
angle
of
the
cloisters
,
the
shell
was
still
left
,
and
it
was
used
partly
as
a
grange
,
partly
as
a
shed
for
cattle
,
the
farm
-
yard
and
tenements
lying
on
this
side
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
garden
and
grounds
,
filling
up
the
ruins
of
Whalley
Abbey
,
offered
abundant
points
of
picturesque
attraction
,
all
of
which
--
with
the
exception
of
the
ruined
conventual
church
--
had
been
visited
by
the
two
girls
.
<EOS>
They
had
tracked
the
labyrinths
of
passages
,
scaled
the
broken
staircases
,
crept
into
the
roofless
and
neglected
chambers
,
peered
timorously
into
the
black
and
yawning
vaults
,
and
now
,
having
finished
their
investigations
,
had
paused
for
awhile
,
previous
to
extending
their
ramble
to
the
church
,
beneath
the
wild
cherry
-
tree
to
listen
to
the
warbling
of
the
birds
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
hear
the
nightingales
at
Middleton
,
Alizon
,
"
observed
Dorothy
Assheton
,
breaking
silence
;
"
they
sing
even
more
exquisitely
than
yon
thrush
.
<EOS>
You
must
come
and
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
show
you
the
old
house
and
gardens
,
though
they
are
very
different
from
these
,
and
we
have
no
ancient
monastic
ruins
to
ornament
them
.
<EOS>
Still
,
they
are
very
beautiful
;
and
,
as
I
find
you
are
fond
of
flowers
,
I
will
show
you
some
I
have
reared
myself
,
<EOS>
for
I
am
something
of
a
gardener
,
Alizon
.
<EOS>
Promise
you
will
come
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
dared
promise
it
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
,
then
?
"
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
What
should
prevent
you
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
Alizon
,
what
I
should
like
better
than
all
?
<EOS>
You
are
so
amiable
,
and
so
good
,
and
so
--
so
very
pretty
;
nay
,
do
n't
blush
--
there
is
no
one
by
to
hear
me
--
you
are
so
charming
altogether
,
that
I
should
like
you
to
come
and
live
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
my
handmaiden
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
desire
nothing
better
,
sweet
young
lady
,
"
replied
Alizon
;
"
but--
"
 
"
But
what
?
"
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
only
your
own
consent
to
obtain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
that
be
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dorothy
,
with
a
disappointed
look
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
likely
your
mother
will
stand
in
the
way
of
your
advancement
,
and
you
have
not
,
I
suppose
,
any
other
tie
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
forgive
me
if
I
appear
too
inquisitive
.
<EOS>
My
curiosity
only
proceeds
from
the
interest
I
take
in
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
--
I
feel
it
,
dear
,
kind
young
lady
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
with
the
colour
again
mounting
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
tie
in
the
world
except
my
family
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
persuaded
my
mother
will
never
allow
me
to
quit
her
,
however
great
the
advantage
might
be
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
though
sorry
,
I
am
scarcely
surprised
at
it
,
"
said
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
love
you
too
dearly
to
part
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
think
so
,
"
sighed
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Proud
of
me
in
some
sort
,
though
with
little
reason
,
she
may
be
,
but
love
me
,
most
assuredly
,
she
does
not
.
<EOS>
Nay
more
,
I
am
persuaded
she
would
be
glad
to
be
freed
from
my
presence
,
which
is
an
evident
restraint
and
annoyance
to
her
,
were
it
not
for
some
motive
stronger
than
natural
affection
that
binds
her
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
in
good
sooth
,
you
amaze
me
,
Alizon
!
"
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
What
possible
motive
can
it
be
,
if
not
of
affection
?
"
 
"
Of
interest
,
I
think
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
I
speak
to
you
without
reserve
,
dear
young
lady
,
for
the
sympathy
you
have
shown
me
deserves
and
demands
confidence
on
my
part
,
and
there
are
none
with
whom
I
can
freely
converse
,
so
that
every
emotion
has
been
locked
up
in
my
own
bosom
.
<EOS>
My
mother
fancies
I
shall
one
day
be
of
use
to
her
,
and
therefore
keeps
me
with
her
.
<EOS>
Hints
to
this
effect
she
has
thrown
out
,
when
indulging
in
the
uncontrollable
fits
of
passion
to
which
she
is
liable
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
have
no
just
reason
to
complain
;
for
though
she
has
shown
me
little
maternal
tenderness
,
and
repelled
all
exhibition
of
affection
on
my
part
,
she
has
treated
me
very
differently
from
her
other
children
,
and
with
much
greater
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
slight
boast
of
education
,
but
the
best
the
village
could
afford
has
been
given
me
;
and
I
have
derived
much
religious
culture
from
good
Doctor
Ormerod
.
<EOS>
The
kind
ladies
of
the
vicarage
proposed
,
as
you
have
done
,
that
I
should
live
with
them
,
but
my
mother
forbade
it
;
enjoining
me
,
on
the
peril
of
incurring
her
displeasure
,
not
to
leave
her
,
and
reminding
me
of
all
the
benefits
I
have
received
from
her
,
and
of
the
necessity
of
making
an
adequate
return
.
<EOS>
And
,
ungrateful
indeed
I
should
be
,
if
I
did
not
comply
;
for
,
though
her
manner
is
harsh
and
cold
to
me
<EOS>
,
she
has
never
ill
-
used
me
,
as
she
has
done
her
favourite
child
,
my
little
sister
Jennet
,
but
has
always
allowed
me
a
separate
chamber
,
where
I
can
retire
when
I
please
,
to
read
,
or
meditate
,
or
pray
.
<EOS>
For
,
alas
!
<EOS>
dear
young
lady
,
I
dare
not
pray
before
my
mother
.
<EOS>
Be
not
shocked
at
what
I
tell
you
,
but
I
can
not
hide
it
.
<EOS>
My
poor
mother
denies
herself
the
consolation
of
religion
--
never
addresses
herself
to
Heaven
in
prayer
--
never
opens
the
book
of
Life
and
Truth
--
never
enters
church
.
<EOS>
In
her
own
mistaken
way
she
has
brought
up
poor
little
Jennet
,
who
has
been
taught
to
make
a
scoff
at
religious
truths
and
ordinances
,
and
has
never
been
suffered
to
keep
holy
the
Sabbath
-
day
.
<EOS>
Happy
and
thankful
am
I
,
that
no
such
evil
lessons
have
been
taught
me
,
but
rather
,
that
I
have
profited
by
the
sad
example
.
<EOS>
In
my
own
secret
chamber
I
have
prayed
,
daily
and
nightly
,
for
both
--
prayed
that
their
hearts
might
be
turned
.
<EOS>
Often
have
I
besought
my
mother
to
let
me
take
Jennet
to
church
,
but
she
never
would
consent
.
<EOS>
And
in
that
poor
misguided
child
,
dear
young
lady
,
there
is
a
strange
mixture
of
good
and
ill
.
<EOS>
Afflicted
with
personal
deformity
,
and
delicate
in
health
,
the
mind
perhaps
sympathising
with
the
body
,
she
is
wayward
and
uncertain
in
temper
,
but
sensitive
and
keenly
alive
to
kindness
,
and
with
a
shrewdness
beyond
her
years
.
<EOS>
At
the
risk
of
offending
my
mother
,
for
I
felt
confident
I
was
acting
rightly
,
I
have
endeavoured
to
instil
religious
principles
into
her
heart
,
and
to
inspire
her
with
a
love
of
truth
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
has
listened
to
me
;
and
I
have
observed
strange
struggles
in
her
nature
,
as
if
the
good
were
obtaining
mastery
of
the
evil
principle
,
and
I
have
striven
the
more
to
convince
her
,
and
win
her
over
,
but
never
with
entire
success
,
for
my
efforts
have
been
overcome
by
pernicious
counsels
,
and
sceptical
sneers
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
young
lady
,
what
would
I
not
do
to
be
the
instrument
of
her
salvation
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
pain
me
much
by
this
relation
,
Alizon
,
"
said
Dorothy
Assheton
,
who
had
listened
with
profound
attention
,
"
and
I
now
wish
more
ardently
than
ever
to
take
you
from
such
a
family
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
leave
them
,
dear
young
lady
,
"
replied
Alizon
;
"
for
I
feel
I
may
be
of
infinite
service
--
especially
to
Jennet
--
by
staying
with
them
.
<EOS>
Where
there
is
a
soul
to
be
saved
,
especially
the
soul
of
one
dear
as
a
sister
,
no
sacrifice
can
be
too
great
to
make
--
<EOS>
no
price
too
heavy
to
pay
.
<EOS>
By
the
blessing
of
Heaven
I
hope
to
save
her
!
<EOS>
And
that
is
the
great
tie
that
binds
me
to
a
home
,
only
so
in
name
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
oppose
your
virtuous
intentions
,
dear
Alizon
,
"
replied
Dorothy
;
"
but
I
must
now
mention
a
circumstance
in
connexion
with
your
mother
,
of
which
you
are
perhaps
in
ignorance
,
but
which
it
is
right
you
should
know
,
and
therefore
no
false
delicacy
on
my
part
shall
restrain
me
from
mentioning
it
.
<EOS>
Your
grandmother
,
Old
Demdike
,
is
in
very
ill
depute
in
Pendle
,
and
is
stigmatised
by
the
common
folk
,
and
even
by
others
,
as
a
witch
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
,
too
,
shares
in
the
opprobrium
attaching
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dreaded
this
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
turning
deadly
pale
,
and
trembling
violently
,
"
<EOS>
I
feared
you
had
heard
the
terrible
report
.
<EOS>
But
oh
,
believe
it
not
!
<EOS>
My
poor
mother
is
erring
enough
,
but
she
is
not
so
bad
as
that
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
believe
it
not
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
believe
it
,
"
said
Dorothy
,
"
since
she
is
blessed
with
such
a
daughter
as
you
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
fear
is
that
you
--
you
so
kind
,
so
good
,
so
beautiful
--
may
come
under
the
same
ban
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
run
this
risk
also
,
in
the
good
work
I
have
appointed
myself
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
ill
thought
of
by
men
,
I
shall
have
the
approval
of
my
own
conscience
to
uphold
me
.
<EOS>
Whatever
betide
,
and
whatever
be
said
,
do
not
you
think
ill
of
me
,
dear
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fear
it
not
,
"
returned
Dorothy
,
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
While
thus
conversing
,
they
gradually
strayed
away
from
the
cherry
-
tree
,
and
taking
a
winding
path
leading
in
that
direction
,
entered
the
conventual
church
,
about
the
middle
of
the
south
aisle
.
<EOS>
After
gazing
with
wonder
and
delight
at
the
still
majestic
pillars
,
that
,
like
ghosts
of
the
departed
brethren
,
seemed
to
protest
against
the
desolation
around
them
,
they
took
their
way
along
the
nave
,
through
broken
arches
,
and
over
prostrate
fragments
of
stone
,
to
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
fane
,
and
having
admired
the
light
shafts
and
clerestory
windows
of
the
choir
,
as
well
as
the
magnificent
painted
glass
over
the
altar
,
they
stopped
before
an
arched
doorway
on
the
right
,
with
two
Gothic
niches
,
in
one
of
which
was
a
small
stone
statue
of
Saint
Agnes
with
her
lamb
,
and
in
the
other
a
similar
representation
of
Saint
Margaret
,
crowned
,
and
piercing
the
dragon
with
a
cross
.
<EOS>
Both
were
sculptures
of
much
merit
,
and
it
was
wonderful
they
had
escaped
destruction
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
closed
,
but
it
easily
opened
when
tried
by
Dorothy
,
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
small
but
beautiful
chapel
.
<EOS>
What
struck
them
chiefly
in
it
was
a
magnificent
monument
of
white
marble
,
enriched
with
numerous
small
shields
,
painted
and
gilt
,
supporting
two
recumbent
figures
,
representing
Henry
de
Lacy
,
one
of
the
founders
of
the
Abbey
,
and
his
consort
.
<EOS>
The
knight
was
cased
in
plate
armour
,
covered
with
a
surcoat
,
emblazoned
with
his
arms
,
and
his
feet
resting
upon
a
hound
.
<EOS>
This
superb
monument
was
wholly
uninjured
,
the
painting
and
gilding
being
still
fresh
and
bright
.
<EOS>
Behind
it
a
flag
had
been
removed
,
discovering
a
flight
of
steep
stone
steps
,
leading
to
a
vault
,
or
other
subterranean
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
After
looking
round
this
chapel
,
Dorothy
remarked
,
"
There
is
something
else
that
has
just
occurred
to
me
.
<EOS>
When
a
child
,
a
strange
dark
tale
was
told
me
,
to
the
effect
that
the
last
ill
-
fated
Abbot
of
Whalley
laid
his
dying
curse
upon
your
grandmother
,
then
an
infant
,
predicting
that
she
should
be
a
witch
,
and
the
mother
of
witches
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
the
dread
tradition
,
too
,
"
rejoined
Alizon
;
"
but
I
can
not
,
will
not
,
believe
it
.
<EOS>
An
all
-
benign
Power
will
never
sanction
such
terrible
imprecations
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Far
be
it
from
me
to
affirm
the
contrary
,
"
replied
Dorothy
;
"
but
it
is
undoubted
that
some
families
have
been
,
and
are
,
under
the
influence
of
an
inevitable
fatality
.
<EOS>
In
one
respect
,
connected
also
with
the
same
unfortunate
prelate
,
I
might
instance
our
own
family
.
<EOS>
Abbot
Paslew
is
said
to
be
unlucky
to
us
even
in
his
grave
.
<EOS>
If
such
a
curse
,
as
I
have
described
,
hangs
over
the
head
of
your
family
,
all
your
efforts
to
remove
it
will
be
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
not
,
"
said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
young
lady
,
you
have
now
penetrated
the
secret
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
of
my
life
is
laid
open
to
you
.
<EOS>
Disguise
it
as
I
may
,
I
can
not
but
believe
my
mother
to
be
under
some
baneful
influence
.
<EOS>
Her
unholy
life
,
her
strange
actions
,
all
impress
me
with
the
idea
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
the
same
tendency
in
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
brother
,
have
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
returned
Alizon
,
slightly
colouring
;
"
but
I
see
little
of
him
,
for
he
lives
near
my
grandmother
,
in
Pendle
Forest
,
and
always
avoids
me
in
his
rare
visits
here
.
<EOS>
You
will
think
it
strange
when
I
tell
you
I
have
never
beheld
my
grandmother
Demdike
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
exclaimed
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
even
been
to
Pendle
,
"
pursued
Alizon
,
"
though
Jennet
and
my
mother
go
there
frequently
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
I
much
wished
to
see
my
aged
relative
,
and
pressed
my
mother
to
take
me
with
her
;
but
she
refused
,
and
now
I
have
no
desire
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Strange
!
"
exclaimed
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Every
thing
you
tell
me
strengthens
the
idea
I
conceived
,
the
moment
I
saw
you
,
and
which
my
brother
also
entertained
,
that
you
are
not
the
daughter
of
Elizabeth
Device
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
your
brother
think
this
?
"
cried
Alizon
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
But
she
immediately
cast
down
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
,
"
replied
Dorothy
,
not
noticing
her
confusion
.
"
<EOS>
'
It
is
impossible
,
'
he
said
,
'
that
that
lovely
girl
can
be
sprung
from'--but
<EOS>
I
will
not
wound
you
by
adding
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
disown
my
kindred
,
"
said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Still
,
I
must
confess
that
some
notions
of
the
sort
have
crossed
me
,
arising
,
probably
,
from
my
mother
's
extraordinary
treatment
,
and
from
many
other
circumstances
,
which
,
though
trifling
in
themselves
,
were
not
without
weight
in
leading
me
to
the
conclusion
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
I
have
treated
it
only
as
a
passing
fancy
,
but
if
you
and
Master
Richard
<EOS>
Assheton"--and
<EOS>
her
voice
slightly
faltered
as
she
pronounced
the
name--"think
<EOS>
so
,
it
may
warrant
me
in
more
seriously
considering
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
consider
it
most
seriously
,
dear
Alizon
,
"
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
up
my
mind
,
and
Richard
has
made
up
his
mind
,
too
,
that
you
are
not
Mother
Demdike
's
grand
-
daughter
,
nor
Elizabeth
Device
's
daughter
,
nor
Jennet
's
sister
--
nor
any
relation
of
theirs
.
<EOS>
We
are
sure
of
it
,
and
we
will
have
you
of
our
mind
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
fair
and
animated
speaker
could
not
help
noticing
the
blushes
that
mantled
Alizon
's
cheeks
as
she
spoke
,
but
she
attributed
them
to
other
than
the
true
cause
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
mend
the
matter
as
she
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
are
well
born
,
Alizon
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
so
it
will
be
found
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
And
Richard
thinks
so
,
too
,
for
he
said
so
to
me
;
and
Richard
is
my
oracle
,
Alizon
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
herself
Alizon
's
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
;
but
she
speedily
checked
the
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
indulge
the
dream
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
strict
inquiries
made
as
to
your
history
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
consent
to
it
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
leave
one
who
,
if
she
be
not
my
parent
,
has
stood
to
me
in
that
relation
.
<EOS>
Neither
can
I
have
her
brought
into
trouble
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
What
will
she
think
of
me
,
if
she
learns
I
have
indulged
such
a
notion
?
<EOS>
She
will
say
,
and
with
truth
,
that
I
am
the
most
ungrateful
of
human
beings
,
as
well
as
the
most
unnatural
of
children
.
<EOS>
No
,
dear
young
lady
,
it
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
These
fancies
are
brilliant
,
but
fallacious
,
and
,
like
bubbles
<EOS>
,
burst
as
soon
as
formed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
admire
your
sentiments
,
though
I
do
not
admit
the
justice
of
your
reasoning
,
"
rejoined
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
on
your
own
account
merely
,
though
that
is
much
,
that
the
secret
of
your
birth
--
if
there
be
one
--
ought
to
be
cleared
up
;
but
,
for
the
sake
of
those
with
whom
you
may
be
connected
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
a
mother
,
like
mine
,
weeping
for
you
as
lost
--
a
brother
,
like
Richard
,
mourning
you
as
dead
.
<EOS>
Think
of
the
sad
hearts
your
restoration
will
make
joyful
.
<EOS>
As
to
Elizabeth
Device
,
no
consideration
should
be
shown
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
has
stolen
you
from
your
parents
,
as
I
suspect
,
she
deserves
no
pity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
this
is
mere
surmise
,
dear
young
lady
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
they
were
startled
,
by
seeing
an
old
woman
come
from
behind
the
monument
and
plant
herself
before
them
.
<EOS>
Both
uttered
a
cry
,
and
would
have
fled
,
but
a
gesture
from
the
crone
detained
them
.
<EOS>
Very
old
was
she
,
and
of
strange
and
sinister
aspect
,
almost
blind
,
bent
double
,
with
frosted
brows
and
chin
,
and
shaking
with
palsy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
where
you
are
,
"
cried
the
hag
,
in
an
imperious
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
Come
nearer
to
me
,
my
pretty
wheans
;
nearer
--
nearer
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
they
complied
,
drawn
towards
her
by
an
impulse
they
could
not
resist
,
the
old
woman
caught
hold
of
Alizon
's
arm
,
and
said
with
a
chuckle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
you
are
the
wench
they
call
Alizon
Device
,
eh
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
trembling
like
a
dove
in
the
talons
of
a
hawk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
who
I
am
?
"
cried
the
hag
,
grasping
her
yet
more
tightly
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
who
I
am
,
I
say
?
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
Mother
Chattox
of
Pendle
Forest
,
the
rival
of
Mother
Demdike
,
and
the
enemy
of
all
her
accursed
brood
.
<EOS>
Now
,
do
you
know
me
,
wench
?
<EOS>
Men
call
me
witch
.
<EOS>
Whether
I
am
so
or
not
,
I
have
some
power
,
as
they
and
you
shall
find
.
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
has
often
defied
me
--
often
injured
me
,
but
I
will
have
my
revenge
upon
her
--
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
greatly
terrified
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
run
and
bring
assistance
,
"
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
And
she
flew
to
the
door
,
but
it
resisted
her
attempts
to
open
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
back
,
"
screamed
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
You
strive
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
door
is
fast
shut
--
fast
shut
.
<EOS>
Come
back
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Who
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
as
the
maid
drew
near
,
ready
to
sink
with
terror
.
"
<EOS>
Your
voice
is
an
Assheton
's
voice
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
now
.
<EOS>
You
are
Dorothy
Assheton
--
whey
-
skinned
,
blue
-
eyed
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
I
owe
your
family
a
grudge
,
and
,
if
you
provoke
me
,
I
will
pay
it
off
in
part
on
you
.
<EOS>
Stir
not
,
as
you
value
your
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
did
not
dare
to
move
,
and
Alizon
remained
as
if
fascinated
by
the
terrible
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
has
happened
,
Dorothy
,
"
pursued
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
hither
to
Whalley
on
business
of
my
own
;
meddling
with
no
one
;
harming
no
one
.
<EOS>
Tread
upon
the
adder
and
it
will
bite
;
and
,
when
molested
,
I
bite
like
the
adder
.
<EOS>
Your
cousin
,
Nick
Assheton
,
came
in
my
way
,
called
me
'
witch
,
'
and
menaced
me
.
<EOS>
I
cursed
him
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
And
then
your
brother
,
Richard--

<EOS>
"
What
of
him
,
in
Heaven
's
name
?
"
almost
shrieked
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
's
this
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mother
Chattox
,
placing
her
hand
on
the
beating
heart
of
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
of
Richard
Assheton
?
"
repeated
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
love
him
<EOS>
,
I
feel
you
do
,
wench
,
"
cried
the
old
crone
with
fierce
exultation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Release
me
,
wicked
woman
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wicked
,
am
I
?
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
rejoined
Mother
Chattox
,
chuckling
maliciously
,
"
because
,
forsooth
,
I
read
thy
heart
,
and
betray
its
secrets
.
<EOS>
Wicked
,
eh
!
<EOS>
I
tell
thee
wench
again
,
Richard
Assheton
is
lord
and
master
here
.
<EOS>
Every
pulse
in
thy
bosom
beats
for
him
--
for
him
alone
.
<EOS>
But
beware
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
Beware
of
it
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
It
shall
bring
thee
ruin
and
despair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
pity
's
sake
,
release
me
,
"
implored
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
"
replied
the
inexorable
old
woman
,
"
not
yet
.
<EOS>
My
tale
is
not
half
told
.
<EOS>
My
curse
fell
on
Richard
's
head
,
as
it
did
on
Nicholas
's
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
hell
-
hounds
thought
to
catch
me
;
but
they
were
at
fault
.
<EOS>
I
tricked
them
nicely
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
However
,
they
took
my
Nance
--
my
pretty
Nance
--
they
seized
her
,
bound
her
,
bore
her
to
the
Calder
--
and
there
swam
her
.
<EOS>
Curses
light
on
them
<EOS>
all!--all!--but
chief
on
him
<EOS>
who
did
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
was
he
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Alizon
,
tremblingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jem
Device
,
"
replied
the
old
woman--"it
was
he
who
bound
her
--
he
who
plunged
her
in
the
river
,
he
who
swam
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
pinch
and
plague
him
for
it
,
I
will
strew
his
couch
with
nettles
,
and
all
wholesome
food
shall
be
poison
to
him
.
<EOS>
His
blood
shall
be
as
water
,
and
his
flesh
shrink
from
his
bones
.
<EOS>
He
shall
waste
away
slowly
--
slowly
--
slowly
--
till
he
drops
like
a
skeleton
into
the
grave
ready
digged
for
him
.
<EOS>
All
connected
with
him
shall
feel
my
fury
.
<EOS>
I
would
kill
thee
now
,
if
thou
wert
aught
of
his
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aught
of
his
!
<EOS>
What
mean
you
,
old
woman
?
"
demanded
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
this
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Chattox
,
"
and
let
the
knowledge
work
in
thee
,
to
the
confusion
of
Bess
Device
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
not
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
I
thought
,
"
cried
Dorothy
Assheton
,
roused
by
the
intelligence
from
her
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
thee
not
this
secret
to
pleasure
thee
,
"
continued
Mother
Chattox
,
"
but
to
confound
Elizabeth
Device
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
motive
.
<EOS>
She
hath
provoked
my
vengeance
,
and
she
shall
feel
it
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
not
her
child
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
The
secret
of
thy
birth
is
known
to
me
,
but
the
time
is
not
yet
come
for
its
disclosure
.
<EOS>
It
shall
out
,
one
day
,
to
the
confusion
of
those
who
offend
me
.
<EOS>
When
thou
goest
home
tell
thy
reputed
mother
what
I
have
said
,
and
mark
how
she
takes
the
information
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
who
comes
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
hag
's
last
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
opened
the
door
of
the
chapel
,
and
,
staring
in
astonishment
at
the
group
,
came
quickly
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
here
,
Mother
Chattox
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
here
to
avoid
pursuit
,
"
replied
the
old
hag
,
with
a
cowed
manner
,
and
in
accents
sounding
strangely
submissive
after
her
late
infuriated
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
been
saying
to
these
girls
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Mistress
Nutter
,
authoritatively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
them
,
"
the
hag
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
declares
that
Alizon
is
not
the
daughter
of
Elizabeth
Device
,
"
cried
Dorothy
Assheton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Mistress
Nutter
quickly
,
and
as
if
a
spring
of
extraordinary
interest
had
been
suddenly
touched
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
reason
hast
thou
for
this
assertion
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
good
reason
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
evasively
,
yet
with
evident
apprehension
of
her
questioner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
reason
or
bad
,
I
will
have
it
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
you
,
too
,
take
an
interest
in
the
wench
,
like
the
rest
!
"
returned
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
so
very
winning
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
no
answer
to
my
question
,
"
said
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Whose
child
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
Bess
Device
,
or
Mother
Demdike
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Mother
Chattox
;
"
they
know
more
about
the
matter
than
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
thee
speak
,
and
to
the
purpose
,
"
cried
the
lady
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Many
an
one
has
lost
a
child
who
would
gladly
have
it
back
again
,
"
said
the
old
hag
,
mysteriously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
has
lost
one
?
"
asked
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
it
passeth
me
to
tell
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
with
affected
ignorance
.
"
<EOS>
Question
those
who
stole
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
set
you
on
the
track
.
<EOS>
If
you
fail
in
pursuing
it
,
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
know
where
to
find
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
go
thus
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
a
direct
answer
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
she
waved
her
hands
twice
or
thrice
over
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
her
figure
seemed
to
dilate
,
and
her
countenance
underwent
a
marked
and
fearful
change
.
<EOS>
All
her
beauty
vanished
,
her
eyes
blazed
,
and
terror
sat
on
her
wrinkled
brow
.
<EOS>
The
hag
,
on
the
contrary
,
crouched
lower
down
,
and
seemed
to
dwindle
less
than
her
ordinary
size
.
<EOS>
Writhing
as
from
heavy
blows
,
and
with
a
mixture
of
malice
and
fear
in
her
countenance
,
she
cried
,
"
Were
I
to
speak
,
you
would
not
thank
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Answer
,
"
vociferated
Mistress
Nutter
,
disregarding
the
caution
,
and
speaking
in
a
sharp
piercing
voice
,
strangely
contrasting
with
her
ordinary
utterance
.
<EOS>
"
Answer
,
I
say
,
or
I
will
beat
thee
to
the
dust
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
continued
her
gestures
,
while
the
sufferings
of
the
old
hag
evidently
increased
,
and
she
crouched
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
ground
,
moaning
out
the
words
,
"
Do
not
force
me
to
speak
.
<EOS>
You
will
repent
it!--you
will
repent
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
torment
her
thus
,
madam
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
who
with
Dorothy
looked
at
the
strange
scene
with
mingled
apprehension
and
wonderment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Much
as
I
desire
to
know
the
secret
of
my
birth
,
I
would
not
obtain
it
thus
.
<EOS>
"
 
As
she
uttered
these
words
,
the
old
woman
contrived
to
shuffle
off
,
and
disappeared
behind
the
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
interpose
,
Alizon
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
somewhat
angrily
,
and
dropping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
You
broke
the
power
I
had
over
her
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
compelled
her
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
gracious
lady
,
for
your
consideration
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
gratefully
;
"
but
the
sight
was
too
painful
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
become
of
her
--
<EOS>
where
is
she
gone
?
"
cried
Dorothy
,
peeping
behind
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
crept
into
this
vault
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
trouble
yourelf
about
her
more
,
Dorothy
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
resuming
her
wonted
voice
and
wonted
looks
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
return
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Thus
much
is
ascertained
,
Alizon
,
that
you
are
no
child
of
your
supposed
parent
.
<EOS>
Wait
a
little
,
and
the
rest
shall
be
found
out
for
you
.
<EOS>
And
,
meantime
,
be
assured
that
I
take
strong
interest
in
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
we
all
do
,
"
added
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
!
<EOS>
thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Alizon
,
almost
overpowered
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
they
went
forth
,
and
,
traversing
the
shafted
aisle
,
quitted
the
conventual
church
,
and
took
their
way
along
the
alley
leading
to
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
not
a
word
at
present
to
Elizabeth
Device
of
the
information
you
have
obtained
,
Alizon
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
reasons
for
this
counsel
,
which
I
will
afterwards
explain
to
you
.
<EOS>
And
do
you
keep
silence
on
the
subject
,
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
not
tell
Richard
?
"
said
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
Richard
--
not
any
one
,
"
returned
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
or
you
may
seriously
affect
Alizon
's
prospects
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
cautioned
me
in
time
,
"
cried
Dorothy
,
"
for
here
<EOS>
comes
my
brother
with
our
cousin
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
a
turn
in
the
alley
showed
Richard
and
Nicholas
Assheton
advancing
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
A
strange
revolution
had
been
produced
in
Alizon
's
feelings
by
the
events
of
the
last
half
hour
.
<EOS>
The
opinions
expressed
by
Dorothy
Assheton
,
as
to
her
birth
,
had
been
singularly
confirmed
by
Mother
Chattox
;
but
could
reliance
be
placed
on
the
old
woman
's
assertions
?
<EOS>
Might
they
not
have
been
made
with
mischievous
intent
?
<EOS>
And
was
it
not
possible
,
nay
,
probable
,
that
,
in
her
place
of
concealment
behind
the
tomb
,
the
vindictive
hag
had
overheard
the
previous
conversation
with
Dorothy
,
and
based
her
own
declaration
upon
it
?
<EOS>
All
these
suggestions
occurred
to
Alizon
,
but
the
previous
idea
having
once
gained
admission
to
her
breast
,
soon
established
itself
firmly
there
,
in
spite
of
doubts
and
misgivings
,
and
began
to
mix
itself
up
with
new
thoughts
and
wishes
,
with
which
other
persons
were
connected
;
for
she
could
not
help
fancying
she
might
be
well
-
born
,
and
if
so
the
vast
distance
heretofore
existing
between
her
and
Richard
Assheton
might
be
greatly
diminished
,
if
not
altogether
removed
.
<EOS>
So
rapid
is
the
progress
of
thought
,
that
only
a
few
minutes
were
required
for
this
long
train
of
reflections
to
pass
through
her
mind
,
and
it
was
merely
put
to
flight
by
the
approach
of
the
main
object
of
her
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
On
joining
the
party
,
Richard
Assheton
saw
plainly
that
something
had
happened
;
but
as
both
his
sister
and
Alizon
laboured
under
evident
embarrassment
,
he
abstained
from
making
inquiries
as
to
its
cause
for
the
present
,
hoping
a
better
opportunity
of
doing
so
would
occur
,
and
the
conversation
was
kept
up
by
Nicholas
Assheton
,
who
described
,
in
his
wonted
lively
manner
,
the
encounter
with
Mother
Chattox
and
Nance
Redferne
,
the
swimming
of
the
latter
,
and
the
trickery
and
punishment
of
Potts
.
<EOS>
During
the
recital
Mistress
Nutter
often
glanced
uneasily
at
the
two
girls
,
but
neither
of
them
offered
any
interruption
until
Nicholas
had
finished
,
when
Dorothy
,
taking
her
brother
's
hand
,
said
,
with
a
look
of
affectionate
admiration
,
"
You
acted
like
yourself
,
dear
Richard
.
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
did
not
venture
to
give
utterance
to
the
same
sentiment
,
but
her
looks
plainly
expressed
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
you
had
punished
that
cruel
James
Device
,
as
well
as
saved
poor
Nance
,
"
added
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
,
glancing
at
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
be
afraid
of
hurting
her
feelings
,
"
cried
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
She
does
not
mind
him
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Dorothy
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Richard
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nothing
--
nothing
,
"
she
replied
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
explain
,
"
said
Richard
to
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
can
not
,
"
she
answered
in
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
laughed
to
see
Potts
creep
out
of
the
river
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
turning
to
Dorothy
;
"
he
looked
just
like
a
drowned
rat
--
ha!--ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
a
bitter
enemy
of
him
,
Nicholas
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
so
look
well
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
heed
him
not
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
;
"
he
knows
me
now
too
well
to
meddle
with
me
again
,
and
I
shall
take
good
care
how
I
put
myself
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
One
thing
I
may
mention
,
to
show
the
impotent
malice
of
the
knave
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
setting
off
,
he
said
,
'
This
is
not
the
only
discovery
of
witchcraft
I
have
made
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
another
case
nearer
home
.
'
<EOS>
What
could
he
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
a
shade
of
disquietude
passing
over
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
quite
capable
of
bringing
the
charge
against
you
or
any
of
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
so
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
what
has
occurred
,
I
wonder
whether
he
will
go
over
to
Rough
Lee
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
not
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
in
that
case
Master
Roger
Nowell
must
provide
some
other
person
competent
to
examine
the
boundary
-
line
of
the
properties
on
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
confident
of
the
adjudication
being
in
your
favour
?
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
so
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
a
self
-
satisfied
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
result
,
I
hope
,
may
justify
your
expectation
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
"
but
it
is
right
to
tell
you
,
that
Sir
Ralph
,
in
consenting
to
postpone
his
decision
,
has
only
done
so
out
of
consideration
to
you
.
<EOS>
If
the
division
of
the
properties
be
as
represented
by
him
,
Master
Nowell
will
unquestionably
obtain
an
award
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Under
such
circumstances
he
may
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
but
you
will
find
the
contrary
turn
out
to
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
will
show
you
a
plan
I
have
had
lately
prepared
,
and
you
can
then
judge
for
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
thus
conversing
,
the
party
passed
through
a
door
in
the
high
stone
wall
dividing
the
garden
from
the
court
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
principal
entrance
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Built
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
Abbey
,
which
had
served
as
a
very
convenient
quarry
for
the
construction
of
this
edifice
,
as
well
as
for
Portfield
,
the
house
was
large
and
irregular
,
planned
chiefly
with
the
view
of
embodying
part
of
the
old
abbot
's
lodging
,
and
consisting
of
a
wide
front
,
with
two
wings
,
one
of
which
looked
into
the
court
,
and
the
other
,
comprehending
the
long
gallery
,
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
The
old
north
-
east
gate
of
the
Abbey
,
with
its
lofty
archway
and
embattled
walls
,
served
as
an
entrance
to
the
great
court
-
yard
,
and
at
its
wicket
ordinarily
stood
Ned
Huddlestone
,
the
porter
,
though
he
was
absent
on
the
present
occasion
,
being
occupied
with
the
May
-
day
festivities
.
<EOS>
Immediately
opposite
the
gateway
sprang
a
flight
of
stone
steps
,
with
a
double
landing
-
place
and
a
broad
balustrade
of
the
same
material
,
on
the
lowest
pillar
of
which
was
placed
a
large
escutcheon
sculptured
with
the
arms
of
the
family
--
argent
,
a
mullet
sable
--
with
a
rebus
on
the
name
--
an
ash
on
a
tun
.
<EOS>
The
great
door
to
which
these
steps
conducted
stood
wide
open
,
and
before
it
,
on
the
upper
landing
-
place
,
were
collected
Lady
Assheton
,
Mistress
Braddyll
,
Mistress
Nicholas
Assheton
,
and
some
other
dames
,
laughing
and
conversing
together
.
<EOS>
Some
long
-
eared
spaniels
,
favourites
of
the
lady
of
the
house
,
were
chasing
each
other
up
and
down
the
steps
,
disturbing
the
slumbers
of
a
couple
of
fine
blood
-
hounds
in
the
court
-
yard
;
or
persecuting
the
proud
peafowl
that
strutted
about
to
display
their
gorgeous
plumage
to
the
spectators
.
 
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
party
approach
,
Lady
Assheton
came
down
to
meet
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
long
absent
,
"
she
said
to
Dorothy
;
"
but
I
suppose
you
have
been
exploring
the
ruins
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
have
not
left
a
hole
or
corner
unvisited
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
right
,
"
said
Lady
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
make
a
good
guide
,
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
have
often
seen
the
old
conventual
church
before
,
Alizon
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
ashamed
to
say
I
have
not
,
your
ladyship
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Assheton
;
"
and
yet
you
have
lived
all
your
life
in
the
village
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
your
ladyship
,
"
answered
Alizon
;
"
but
these
ruins
have
been
prohibited
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
by
us
,
"
said
Lady
Assheton
;
"
they
are
open
to
every
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
forbidden
to
visit
them
by
my
mother
,
"
said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
And
for
the
first
time
the
word
"
mother
"
seemed
strange
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Assheton
looked
surprised
,
but
made
no
remark
,
and
mounting
the
steps
,
led
the
way
to
a
spacious
though
not
very
lofty
chamber
,
with
huge
uncovered
rafters
,
and
a
floor
of
polished
oak
.
<EOS>
Over
a
great
fireplace
at
one
side
,
furnished
with
immense
andirons
,
hung
a
noble
pair
of
antlers
,
and
similar
trophies
of
the
chase
were
affixed
to
other
parts
of
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
were
likewise
hung
rusty
skull
-
caps
,
breastplates
,
two
-
handed
and
single
-
handed
swords
,
maces
,
halberts
,
and
arquebusses
,
with
chain
-
shirts
,
buff
-
jerkins
,
matchlocks
,
and
other
warlike
implements
,
amongst
which
were
several
shields
painted
with
the
arms
of
the
Asshetons
and
their
alliances
.
<EOS>
High
-
backed
chairs
of
gilt
leather
were
ranged
against
the
walls
,
and
ebony
cabinets
inlaid
with
ivory
were
set
between
them
at
intervals
,
supporting
rare
specimens
of
glass
and
earthenware
.
<EOS>
Opposite
the
fireplace
,
stood
a
large
clock
,
curiously
painted
and
decorated
with
emblematical
devices
,
with
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
,
and
provided
with
movable
figures
to
strike
the
hours
on
a
bell
;
while
from
the
centre
of
the
roof
hung
a
great
chandelier
of
stag
's
horn
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Assheton
did
not
tarry
long
within
the
entrance
hall
,
for
such
it
was
,
but
conducted
her
guests
through
an
arched
doorway
on
the
right
into
the
long
gallery
.
<EOS>
One
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
,
and
proportionately
wide
and
lofty
,
this
vast
chamber
had
undergone
little
change
since
its
original
construction
by
the
old
owners
of
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Panelled
and
floored
with
lustrous
oak
,
and
hung
in
some
parts
with
antique
tapestry
,
representing
scriptural
subjects
,
one
side
was
pierced
with
lofty
pointed
windows
,
looking
out
upon
the
garden
,
while
the
southern
extremity
boasted
a
magnificent
window
,
with
heavy
stone
mullions
,
though
of
more
recent
workmanship
than
the
framework
,
commanding
Whalley
Nab
and
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
of
the
apartment
was
grand
but
gloomy
,
and
consisted
of
antique
chairs
and
tables
belonging
to
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Some
curious
ecclesiastical
sculptures
,
wood
carvings
,
and
saintly
images
,
were
placed
at
intervals
near
the
walls
,
and
on
the
upper
panels
were
hung
a
row
of
family
portraits
.
 
<EOS>
Quitting
the
rest
of
the
company
,
and
proceeding
to
the
southern
window
,
Dorothy
invited
Alizon
and
her
brother
to
place
themselves
beside
her
on
the
cushioned
seats
of
the
deep
embrasure
.
<EOS>
Little
conversation
,
however
,
ensued
;
Alizon
's
heart
being
too
full
for
utterance
,
and
recent
occurrences
engrossing
Dorothy
's
thoughts
,
to
the
exclusion
of
every
thing
else
.
<EOS>
Having
made
one
or
two
unsuccessful
efforts
to
engage
them
in
talk
,
Richard
likewise
lapsed
into
silence
,
and
gazed
out
on
the
lovely
scenery
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
evening
has
been
described
as
beautiful
;
and
the
swift
Calder
,
as
it
hurried
by
,
was
tinged
with
rays
of
the
declining
sun
,
whilst
the
woody
heights
of
Whalley
Nab
were
steeped
in
the
same
rosy
light
.
<EOS>
But
the
view
failed
to
interest
Richard
in
his
present
mood
,
and
after
a
brief
survey
,
he
stole
a
look
at
Alizon
,
and
was
surprised
to
find
her
in
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
saddening
thoughts
cross
you
,
fair
girl
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
with
deep
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
account
for
my
sudden
despondency
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
I
have
heard
that
great
happiness
is
the
precursor
of
dejection
,
and
the
saying
I
suppose
must
be
true
,
for
I
have
been
happier
to
-
day
than
I
ever
was
before
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
But
the
feeling
of
sadness
is
now
past
,
"
she
added
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
said
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
not
know
what
has
occurred
to
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
present
,
"
interposed
Dorothy
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
am
sure
you
will
be
pleased
when
you
are
made
acquainted
with
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
would
tell
you
now
if
I
might
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
guess
?
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
rejoined
Dorothy
,
who
was
dying
to
tell
him
.
"
<EOS>
May
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
no
!
"
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
perverse
,
"
said
Richard
,
with
a
look
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
harm
in
guessing
;
and
you
can
please
yourself
as
to
giving
an
answer
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
,
then
,
that
Alizon
has
made
some
discovery
.
"
 
<EOS>
Dorothy
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Relative
to
her
parentage
?
"
pursued
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
Another
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
found
out
she
is
not
Elizabeth
Device
's
daughter
?
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
witch
must
have
told
you
this
,
"
exclaimed
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
indeed
guessed
rightly
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Richard
,
with
an
eagerness
that
startled
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
Speak
plainly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
answer
him
,
Alizon
?
"
said
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
do
not
appeal
to
me
,
dear
young
lady
,
"
she
answered
,
blushing
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
gone
too
far
to
retreat
,
"
rejoined
Dorothy
,
"
and
therefore
,
despite
Mistress
Nutter
's
interdiction
,
the
truth
shall
out
.
<EOS>
You
have
guessed
shrewdly
,
Richard
.
<EOS>
A
discovery
_
has
_
been
made
--
a
very
great
discovery
.
<EOS>
Alizon
is
not
the
daughter
of
Elizabeth
Device
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
intelligence
delights
me
,
though
it
scarcely
surprises
me
,
"
cried
Richard
,
gazing
with
heartfelt
pleasure
at
the
blushing
girl
;
"
<EOS>
for
I
was
sure
of
the
fact
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
Nothing
so
good
and
charming
as
Alizon
could
spring
from
so
foul
a
source
.
<EOS>
How
and
by
what
means
you
have
derived
this
information
,
as
well
as
whose
daughter
you
are
,
I
shall
wait
patiently
to
learn
.
<EOS>
Enough
for
me
you
are
not
the
sister
of
James
Device
--
enough
you
are
not
the
grandchild
of
Mother
Demdike
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
all
I
know
,
in
knowing
thus
much
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
timidly
.
"
<EOS>
And
secrecy
has
been
enjoined
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
in
order
that
the
rest
may
be
found
out
.
<EOS>
But
oh
!
should
the
hopes
I
have
--
perhaps
too
hastily
--
indulged
,
prove
fallacious--
<EOS>
"
 
"
They
can
not
be
fallacious
,
Alizon
,
"
interrupted
Richard
,
eagerly
.
"
<EOS>
On
that
score
rest
easy
.
<EOS>
Your
connexion
with
that
wretched
family
is
for
ever
broken
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
see
the
necessity
of
caution
,
and
shall
observe
it
.
<EOS>
And
so
Mistress
Nutter
takes
an
interest
in
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
strongest
,
"
replied
Dorothy
;
"
but
see
!
<EOS>
she
comes
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
we
must
now
go
back
for
a
short
space
.
 
<EOS>
While
Mistress
Nutter
and
Nicholas
were
seated
at
a
table
examining
a
plan
of
the
Rough
Lee
estates
,
the
latter
was
greatly
astonished
to
see
the
door
open
and
give
admittance
to
Master
Potts
,
who
he
fancied
snugly
lying
between
a
couple
of
blankets
,
at
the
Dragon
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
was
clad
in
a
riding
-
dress
,
which
he
had
exchanged
for
his
wet
habiliments
,
and
was
accompanied
by
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
and
Master
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Nicholas
,
he
instantly
stepped
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
squire
<EOS>
,
"
he
cried
,
"
you
did
not
expect
to
see
me
again
so
soon
,
eh
!
<EOS>
A
pottle
of
hot
sack
put
my
blood
into
circulation
,
and
having
,
luckily
,
a
change
of
raiment
in
my
valise
,
I
am
all
right
again
.
<EOS>
Not
so
easily
got
rid
of
,
you
see
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
it
appears
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
trifling
account
to
settle
together
,
sir
,
"
said
the
attorney
,
putting
on
a
serious
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whenever
you
please
,
sir
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
good
-
humouredly
,
tapping
the
hilt
of
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
that
way
,
"
cried
Potts
,
darting
quickly
back
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
fight
with
those
weapons
--
never
.
<EOS>
Our
dispute
must
be
settled
in
a
court
of
law
,
sir
--
in
a
court
of
law
.
<EOS>
You
understand
,
Master
Nicholas
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
shrewd
maxim
,
Master
Potts
,
that
he
who
is
his
own
lawyer
has
a
fool
for
his
client
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
drily
.
"
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
better
to
stick
to
the
defence
of
others
,
rather
than
practise
in
your
own
behalf
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
expressed
my
opinion
,
Master
Nicholas
,
"
observed
Roger
Nowell
;
"
and
I
hope
Master
Potts
will
not
commence
any
action
on
his
own
account
till
he
has
finished
my
business
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
not
,
sir
,
since
you
desire
it
,
"
replied
the
attorney
,
obsequiously
.
"
<EOS>
But
my
motives
must
not
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
clear
case
of
assault
and
battery
against
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
,
or
I
may
proceed
against
him
criminally
for
an
attempt
on
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
given
him
no
provocation
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sir
Ralph
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
provocation
can
justify
the
treatment
I
have
experienced
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
replied
Potts
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
to
show
I
am
a
man
of
peace
,
and
harbour
no
resentment
,
however
just
grounds
I
may
have
for
such
a
feeling
,
I
am
willing
to
make
up
the
matter
with
Master
Nicholas
,
provided--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
offers
you
a
handsome
consideration
,
eh
?
"
said
the
squire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Provided
he
offers
me
a
handsome
apology
--
such
as
a
gentleman
may
accept
,
"
rejoined
Potts
,
consequentially
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
which
he
will
not
refuse
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
,
glancing
at
his
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
certainly
be
sorry
to
have
drowned
you
,
"
said
the
squire--"very
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
--
enough
--
I
am
content
,
"
cried
Potts
,
holding
out
his
hand
,
which
Nicholas
grasped
with
an
energy
that
brought
tears
into
the
little
man
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
the
matter
is
amicably
adjusted
,
"
observed
Roger
Nowell
,
"
for
I
suspect
both
parties
have
been
to
blame
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
now
request
you
,
Master
Potts
,
to
forego
your
search
,
and
inquiries
after
witches
,
till
such
time
as
you
have
settled
this
question
of
the
boundary
line
for
me
.
<EOS>
One
matter
at
a
time
,
my
good
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
cried
Potts
,
"
my
much
esteemed
and
singular
good
client--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
no
nay
,
"
interrupted
Nowell
,
peremptorily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Potts
;
"
I
shall
lose
the
best
chance
of
distinction
ever
thrown
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
,
"
said
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
as
you
came
up
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
"
I
was
examining
a
plan
of
the
disputed
estates
in
Pendle
Forest
.
<EOS>
It
differs
from
yours
,
and
,
if
correct
,
certainly
substantiates
Mistress
Nutter
's
claim
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
mine
with
me
,
"
replied
Nowell
,
producing
a
plan
,
and
opening
it
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
compare
the
two
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
The
line
runs
thus:--From
the
foot
of
Pendle
Hill
,
beginning
with
Barley
Booth
,
the
boundary
is
marked
by
a
stone
wall
,
as
far
as
certain
fields
in
the
occupation
of
John
Ogden
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
comparing
the
statement
with
the
other
plan
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
then
runs
on
in
a
northerly
direction
,
"
pursued
Nowell
,
"
towards
Burst
Clough
,
and
<EOS>
here
the
landmarks
are
certain
stones
placed
in
the
moor
,
one
hundred
yards
apart
,
and
giving
me
twenty
acres
of
this
land
,
and
Mistress
Nutter
ten
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
plan
gives
Mistress
Nutter
twenty
acres
,
and
you
ten
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
the
plan
is
wrong
,
"
cried
Nowell
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
carefully
prepared
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
had
approached
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
;
it
is
wrong
,
I
say
,
"
cried
Nowell
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
where
the
landmarks
are
placed
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
pointing
to
the
measurement
.
<EOS>
"
I
merely
go
by
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
landmarks
are
improperly
placed
in
that
plan
,
"
cried
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
examine
them
myself
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Potts
,
taking
out
a
large
memorandum
-
hook
;
"
there
can
not
be
an
error
of
ten
acres
--
ten
perches
--
or
ten
feet
,
possibly
,
but
acres
--
pshaw
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Laugh
as
you
please
;
but
go
on
,
"
said
Mrs.
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
pursued
Nicholas
,
"
the
line
approaches
the
bank
of
a
rivulet
,
called
Moss
Brook
--
a
rare
place
for
woodcocks
and
snipes
that
Moss
Brook
,
I
may
remark
--
the
land
on
the
left
consisting
of
five
acres
of
waste
land
,
marked
by
a
sheepfold
,
and
two
posts
set
up
in
a
line
with
it
,
belonging
to
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
Mistress
Nutter
!
"
exclaimed
Nowell
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
To
me
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
here
set
down
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
set
down
wrongfully
,
"
cried
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
That
plan
is
altogether
incorrect
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
which
side
of
the
field
does
the
rivulet
flow
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
right
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
left
,
"
cried
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
must
be
some
extraordinary
mistake
,
"
said
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
a
note
of
that
,
and
examine
it
to
-
morrow.--N.B.
Waste
land
--
<EOS>
sheepfold--
rivulet
called
Moss
Brook
,
flowing
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
right
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
rejoined
Potts
,
"
I
have
made
the
entry
as
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
Master
Nicholas
,
"
said
Nowell
,
"
I
should
like
to
see
how
many
other
errors
that
plan
contains
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Passing
the
rivulet
,
"
pursued
the
squire
,
"
we
come
to
a
footpath
leading
to
the
limestone
quarry
,
about
which
there
can
be
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
Then
by
Cat
Gallows
Wood
and
Swallow
Hole
;
and
then
by
another
path
to
Worston
Moor
,
skirting
a
hut
in
the
occupation
of
James
Device
--
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
Master
Jem
,
are
you
here
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
dwelt
with
your
grandmother
at
Malkin
Tower
--
excuse
me
,
Master
Nowell
,
but
one
must
relieve
the
dulness
of
this
plan
by
an
exclamation
or
so
--
and
here
being
waste
land
again
,
the
landmarks
are
certain
stones
set
at
intervals
towards
Hook
Cliff
,
and
giving
Mistress
Nutter
two
-
thirds
of
the
whole
moor
,
and
Master
Roger
Nowell
one
-
third
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
False
again
,
"
cried
Nowell
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
two
-
thirds
are
mine
,
the
one
-
third
Mistress
Nutter
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Somebody
must
be
very
wrong
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
wrong
indeed
,
"
added
Potts
;
<EOS>
"
and
I
suspect
that
that
somebody
is--
"
 
"
Master
Nowell
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
cried
Master
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Both
are
wrong
and
both
right
,
according
to
your
own
showing
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
will
decide
the
question
,
"
said
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
wait
till
then
,
"
interposed
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"
Take
both
plans
with
you
,
and
you
will
then
ascertain
which
is
correct
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed
,
"
cried
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
here
is
mine
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
abide
by
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
Master
Potts
and
I
will
verify
the
statements
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
attorney
,
putting
his
memorandum
book
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
plans
were
then
delivered
to
the
custody
of
Sir
Ralph
,
who
promised
to
hand
them
over
to
Potts
and
Nicholas
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
then
separated
;
Mistress
Nutter
shaping
her
course
towards
the
window
where
Alizon
and
the
two
other
young
people
were
seated
,
while
Potts
,
plucking
the
squire
's
sleeve
,
said
,
with
a
very
mysterious
look
,
that
he
desired
a
word
with
him
in
private
.
<EOS>
Wondering
what
could
be
the
nature
of
the
communication
the
attorney
desired
to
make
,
Nicholas
withdrew
with
him
into
a
corner
,
and
Nowell
,
who
saw
them
retire
,
and
could
not
help
watching
them
with
some
curiosity
,
remarked
that
the
squire
's
hilarious
countenance
fell
as
he
listened
to
the
attorney
,
while
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
features
of
the
latter
gleamed
with
malicious
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mistress
Nutter
approached
Alizon
,
and
beckoning
her
towards
her
,
they
quitted
the
room
together
.
<EOS>
As
the
young
girl
went
forth
,
she
cast
a
wistful
look
at
Dorothy
and
her
brother
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
with
me
,
that
that
lovely
girl
is
well
born
?
"
said
Dorothy
,
as
Alizon
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
were
heresy
to
doubt
it
,
"
answered
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
you
another
secret
?
"
<EOS>
she
continued
,
regarding
him
<EOS>
fixedly--"if
,
indeed
,
it
be
a
secret
,
for
you
must
be
sadly
wanting
in
discernment
if
you
have
not
found
it
out
ere
this
.
<EOS>
She
loves
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dorothy
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
would
not
tell
you
this
,
if
I
were
not
quite
equally
sure
that
you
love
her
in
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
my
faith
,
Dorothy
,
you
give
yourself
credit
for
wonderful
penetration
,
"
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
whit
more
than
I
am
entitled
to
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
it
will
not
do
to
attempt
concealment
with
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
been
certain
of
the
matter
before
,
your
manner
now
would
convince
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
will
make
a
charming
sister
,
and
I
shall
he
very
fond
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
you
do
run
on
,
madcap
!
"
<EOS>
cried
her
brother
,
trying
to
look
displeased
,
but
totally
failing
in
assuming
the
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stranger
things
have
come
to
pass
,
"
said
Dorothy
;
"
and
one
reads
in
story
-
hooks
of
young
nobles
marrying
village
maidens
in
spite
of
parental
opposition
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
will
get
nobody
's
consent
to
the
marriage
but
mine
,
Richard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
,
"
he
replied
,
rather
blankly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
if
she
should
not
turn
out
to
be
somebody
's
daughter
,
"
pursued
Dorothy
;
"
somebody
,
I
mean
,
quite
as
great
as
the
heir
of
Middleton
,
which
I
make
no
doubt
she
will
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
may
,
"
replied
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
would
n't
marry
her
if
she
did
n't
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
ashamed
of
you
,
Richard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
remove
all
opposition
,
at
all
events
,
"
said
her
brother
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
it
would
,
"
said
Dorothy
;
"
and
now
I
'll
tell
you
another
notion
of
mine
,
Richard
.
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
,
it
has
come
into
my
head
that
Alizon
is
the
daughter
of
--
whom
do
you
think
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whom
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Guess
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
'll
tell
you
without
more
ado
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
it
's
only
my
notion
,
and
I
've
no
precise
grounds
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
my
opinion
,
she
's
the
daughter
of
the
lady
who
has
just
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
Mistress
Nutter
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Richard
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
think
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
extraordinary
and
otherwise
unaccountable
interest
she
takes
in
her
,
"
replied
Dorothy
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
if
you
recollect
,
Mistress
Nutter
had
an
infant
daughter
who
was
lost
in
a
strange
manner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
the
child
died
,
"
replied
Richard
;
"
but
it
may
be
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Time
will
show
,
"
said
Dorothy
;
"
but
I
have
made
up
my
mind
about
the
matter
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Nicholas
Assheton
came
up
to
them
,
looking
grave
and
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
?
"
asked
Richard
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
received
some
very
unpleasant
intelligence
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
of
a
menace
uttered
by
that
confounded
Potts
,
on
quitting
me
after
his
ducking
.
<EOS>
He
has
now
spoken
out
plainly
,
and
declares
he
overheard
part
of
a
conversation
between
Mistress
Nutter
and
Elizabeth
Device
,
which
took
place
in
the
ruins
of
the
convent
church
this
morning
,
and
he
is
satisfied
that--
"
 
"
Well
!
"
cried
Richard
,
breathlessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
Mistress
Nutter
is
a
witch
,
and
in
league
with
witches
,
"
continued
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
,
turning
deathly
pale
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
the
rascal
has
invented
the
charge
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
"
but
he
is
quite
unscrupulous
enough
to
make
it
;
and
,
if
made
,
it
will
be
fatal
to
our
relative
's
reputation
,
if
not
to
her
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
,
I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
cried
Richard
,
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
I
could
think
so
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dorothy
,
suddenly
recollecting
Mistress
Nutter
's
strange
demeanour
in
the
little
chapel
,
and
the
unaccountable
influence
she
seemed
to
exercise
over
the
old
crone
.
<EOS>
"
But
something
has
occurred
to
-
day
that
leads
me
to
a
contrary
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
now
--
not
now
,
"
replied
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whatever
suspicions
you
may
entertain
,
keep
silence
,
or
you
will
destroy
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fear
me
not
,
"
rejoined
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Alizon
!
<EOS>
"
she
murmured
,
"
that
this
unhappy
question
should
arise
at
such
a
moment
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
indeed
believe
the
charge
,
Dorothy
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Richard
,
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
she
answered
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
If
Alizon
be
her
daughter
,
she
can
never
be
your
wife
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
--
never
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Dorothy
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
daughter
of
a
witch
,
be
that
witch
named
Elizabeth
Device
or
Alice
Nutter
,
is
no
mate
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
prejudge
Mistress
Nutter
,
Dorothy
,
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
Richard
.
<EOS>
I
have
too
good
reason
for
what
I
say
,
"
she
answered
,
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
uttered
an
exclamation
of
despair
.
<EOS>
And
on
the
instant
the
lively
sounds
of
tabor
and
pipe
,
mixed
with
the
jingling
of
bells
,
arose
from
the
court
-
yard
,
and
presently
afterwards
an
attendant
entered
to
announce
that
the
May
-
day
revellers
were
without
,
and
directions
were
given
by
Sir
Ralph
that
they
should
be
shown
into
the
great
banqueting
-
hall
below
the
gallery
,
which
had
been
prepared
for
their
reception
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIII.--THE
REVELATION
.
  
<EOS>
On
quitting
the
long
gallery
,
Mistress
Nutter
and
Alizon
ascended
a
wide
staircase
,
and
,
traversing
a
corridor
,
came
to
an
antique
,
tapestried
chamber
,
richly
but
cumbrously
furnished
,
having
a
carved
oak
bedstead
with
sombre
hangings
,
a
few
high
-
backed
chairs
of
the
same
material
,
and
a
massive
wardrobe
,
with
shrine
-
work
atop
,
and
two
finely
sculptured
figures
,
of
the
size
of
life
,
in
the
habits
of
Cistertian
monks
,
placed
as
supporters
at
either
extremity
.
<EOS>
At
one
side
of
the
bed
the
tapestry
was
drawn
aside
,
showing
the
entrance
to
a
closet
or
inner
room
,
and
opposite
it
there
was
a
great
yawning
fireplace
,
with
a
lofty
mantelpiece
and
chimney
projecting
beyond
the
walls
.
<EOS>
The
windows
were
narrow
,
and
darkened
by
heavy
transom
bars
and
small
diamond
panes
while
the
view
without
,
looking
upon
Whalley
Nab
,
was
obstructed
by
the
contiguity
of
a
tall
cypress
,
whose
funereal
branches
added
to
the
general
gloom
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
one
of
those
formerly
allotted
to
their
guests
by
the
hospitable
abbots
,
and
had
undergone
little
change
since
their
time
,
except
in
regard
to
furniture
;
and
even
that
appeared
old
and
faded
now
.
<EOS>
What
with
the
gloomy
arras
,
the
shrouded
bedstead
,
and
the
Gothic
wardrobe
with
its
mysterious
figures
,
the
chamber
had
a
grim
,
ghostly
air
,
and
so
the
young
girl
thought
on
entering
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
you
hither
,
Alizon
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
motioning
her
to
a
seat
,
"
that
we
may
converse
without
chance
of
interruption
,
for
I
have
much
to
say
.
<EOS>
On
first
seeing
you
to
-
day
,
your
appearance
,
so
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
May
-
day
mummers
,
struck
me
forcibly
,
and
I
resolved
to
question
Elizabeth
Device
about
you
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
bade
her
join
me
in
the
Abbey
gardens
.
<EOS>
She
did
so
,
and
had
not
long
left
me
when
I
accidentally
met
you
and
the
others
in
the
Lacy
Chapel
.
<EOS>
When
questioned
,
Elizabeth
affected
great
surprise
,
and
denied
positively
that
there
was
any
foundation
for
the
idea
that
you
were
other
than
her
child
;
but
,
notwithstanding
her
asseverations
,
I
could
see
from
her
confused
manner
that
there
was
more
in
the
notion
than
she
chose
to
admit
,
and
I
determined
to
have
recourse
to
other
means
of
arriving
at
the
truth
,
little
expecting
my
suspicions
would
be
so
soon
confirmed
by
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
To
my
interrogation
of
that
old
woman
,
you
were
yourself
a
party
,
and
I
am
now
rejoiced
that
you
interfered
to
prevent
me
from
prosecuting
my
inquiries
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
present
from
whom
the
secret
of
your
birth
must
be
strictly
kept
--
at
least
,
for
awhile
--
and
my
impatience
carried
me
too
far
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
obeyed
a
natural
impulse
,
madam
,
"
said
Alizon
;
"
but
I
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
what
claim
I
can
possibly
have
to
the
consideration
you
show
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
and
you
shall
learn
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
sad
tale
,
and
its
recital
will
tear
open
old
wounds
,
but
it
must
not
be
withheld
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
you
to
bury
the
secrets
I
am
about
to
impart
in
the
recesses
of
your
bosom
.
<EOS>
You
will
do
so
when
you
learn
them
,
without
my
telling
you
.
<EOS>
When
little
more
than
your
age
I
was
wedded
;
but
not
to
him
I
would
have
chosen
if
choice
had
been
permitted
me
.
<EOS>
The
union
I
need
scarcely
say
was
unhappy
--
most
unhappy
--
though
my
discomforts
were
scrupulously
concealed
,
and
I
was
looked
upon
as
a
devoted
wife
,
and
my
husband
as
a
model
of
conjugal
affection
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
merely
the
surface
--
internally
all
was
strife
and
misery
.
<EOS>
Erelong
my
dislike
of
my
husband
increased
to
absolute
hate
,
while
on
his
part
,
though
he
still
regarded
me
with
as
much
passion
as
heretofore
,
he
became
frantically
jealous
--
and
above
all
of
Edward
Braddyll
of
Portfield
,
who
,
as
his
bosom
friend
,
and
my
distant
relative
,
was
a
frequent
visiter
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
To
relate
the
numerous
exhibitions
of
jealousy
that
occurred
would
answer
little
purpose
,
and
it
will
be
enough
to
say
that
not
a
word
or
look
passed
between
Edward
and
myself
but
was
misconstrued
.
<EOS>
I
took
care
never
to
be
alone
with
our
guest
--
nor
to
give
any
just
ground
for
suspicion
--
but
my
caution
availed
nothing
.
<EOS>
An
easy
remedy
would
have
been
to
forbid
Edward
the
house
,
but
this
my
husband
's
pride
rejected
.
<EOS>
He
preferred
to
endure
the
jealous
torment
occasioned
by
the
presence
of
his
wife
's
fancied
lover
,
and
inflict
needless
anguish
on
her
,
rather
than
brook
the
jeers
of
a
few
indifferent
acquaintances
.
<EOS>
The
same
feeling
made
him
desire
to
keep
up
an
apparent
good
understanding
with
me
;
and
so
far
I
seconded
his
views
,
for
I
shared
in
his
pride
,
if
in
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
Our
quarrels
were
all
in
private
,
when
no
eye
could
see
us
--
no
ear
listen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yours
is
a
melancholy
history
,
madam
,
"
remarked
Alizon
,
in
a
tone
of
profound
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
think
so
ere
<EOS>
I
have
done
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
The
only
person
in
my
confidence
,
and
aware
of
my
secret
sorrows
,
was
Elizabeth
Device
,
who
with
her
husband
,
John
Device
,
then
lived
at
Rough
Lee
.
<EOS>
Serving
me
in
the
quality
of
tire
-
woman
and
personal
attendant
,
she
could
not
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
what
took
place
,
and
the
poor
soul
offered
me
all
the
sympathy
in
her
power
.
<EOS>
Much
was
it
needed
,
for
I
had
no
other
sympathy
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
,
I
know
not
from
what
cause
,
unless
from
some
imprudence
on
the
part
of
Edward
Braddyll
,
who
was
wild
and
reckless
,
my
husband
conceived
worse
suspicions
than
ever
of
me
,
and
began
to
treat
me
with
such
harshness
and
cruelty
,
that
,
unable
longer
to
endure
his
violence
,
I
appealed
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
of
a
stern
and
arbitrary
nature
,
and
,
having
forced
me
into
the
match
,
would
not
listen
to
my
complaints
,
but
bade
me
submit
.
'
<EOS>
It
was
my
duty
to
do
so
,
'
he
said
,
and
he
added
some
cutting
expressions
to
the
effect
that
I
deserved
the
treatment
I
experienced
,
and
dismissed
me
.
<EOS>
Driven
to
desperation
,
I
sought
counsel
and
assistance
from
one
I
should
most
have
avoided
--
from
Edward
Braddyll
--
and
he
proposed
flight
from
my
husband
's
roof
--
flight
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
were
saved
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
,
greatly
shocked
by
the
narration
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
saved
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
out
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
"
<EOS>
Outraged
as
my
feelings
were
,
and
loathsome
as
my
husband
was
to
me
,
I
spurned
the
base
proposal
,
and
instantly
quitted
my
false
friend
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
I
have
seen
him
more
,
if
permitted
;
but
that
secret
interview
with
him
was
my
first
<EOS>
and
last;--for
it
had
been
witnessed
by
my
husband
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Concealed
behind
the
arras
,
Richard
Nutter
heard
enough
to
confirm
his
worst
suspicions
,
"
pursued
the
lady
;
"
but
he
did
not
hear
my
justification
.
<EOS>
He
saw
Edward
Braddyll
at
my
feet
--
he
heard
him
urge
me
to
fly
--
but
he
did
not
wait
to
learn
if
I
consented
,
and
,
looking
upon
me
as
guilty
,
left
his
hiding
-
place
to
take
measures
for
frustrating
the
plan
,
he
supposed
concerted
between
us
.
<EOS>
That
night
I
was
made
prisoner
in
my
room
,
and
endured
treatment
the
most
inhuman
.
<EOS>
But
a
proposal
was
made
by
my
husband
,
that
promised
some
alleviation
of
my
suffering
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
we
were
to
meet
only
in
public
,
when
a
semblance
of
affection
was
to
be
maintained
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
,
he
said
,
to
save
my
character
,
and
preserve
his
own
name
unspotted
in
the
eyes
of
others
,
however
tarnished
it
might
be
in
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
willingly
consented
to
the
arrangement
;
and
thus
for
a
brief
space
I
became
tranquil
,
if
not
happy
.
<EOS>
But
another
and
severer
trial
awaited
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Alizon
,
sympathisingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
cup
of
sorrow
,
I
thought
,
was
full
,
"
pursued
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
but
the
drop
was
wanting
to
make
it
overflow
.
<EOS>
It
came
soon
enough
.
<EOS>
Amidst
my
griefs
I
expected
to
be
a
mother
,
and
with
that
thought
how
many
fond
and
cheering
anticipations
mingled
!
<EOS>
In
my
child
I
hoped
to
find
a
balm
for
my
woes
:
in
its
smiles
and
innocent
endearments
a
compensation
for
the
harshness
and
injustice
<EOS>
I
had
experienced
.
<EOS>
How
little
did
I
foresee
that
it
was
to
be
a
new
instrument
of
torture
to
me
;
and
that
I
should
be
cruelly
robbed
of
the
only
blessing
ever
vouchsafed
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
the
child
die
,
madam
?
"
asked
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
daughter
was
born
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
made
happy
by
its
birth
.
<EOS>
A
new
existence
,
bright
and
unclouded
,
seemed
dawning
upon
me
;
but
it
was
like
a
sunburst
on
a
stormy
day
.
<EOS>
Some
two
months
before
this
event
Elizabeth
Device
had
given
birth
to
a
daughter
,
and
she
now
took
my
child
under
her
fostering
care
;
for
weakness
prevented
me
from
affording
it
the
support
it
is
a
mother
's
blessed
privilege
to
bestow
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
as
fond
of
it
as
myself
;
and
never
was
babe
more
calculated
to
win
love
than
my
little
Millicent
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
go
on
?
<EOS>
The
retrospect
I
am
compelled
to
take
is
frightful
,
but
I
can
not
shun
it
.
<EOS>
The
foul
and
false
suspicions
entertained
by
my
husband
began
to
settle
on
the
child
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
believe
it
to
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
With
violent
oaths
and
threats
he
first
announced
his
odious
suspicions
to
Elizabeth
Device
,
and
she
,
full
of
terror
,
communicated
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
tidings
filled
me
with
inexpressible
alarm
;
for
I
knew
,
if
the
dread
idea
had
once
taken
possession
of
him
,
it
would
never
be
removed
,
while
what
he
threatened
would
be
executed
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
fled
at
once
with
my
poor
babe
if
I
had
known
where
to
go
;
but
I
had
no
place
of
shelter
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
in
vain
to
seek
refuge
with
my
father
;
and
I
had
no
other
relative
or
friend
whom
I
could
trust
.
<EOS>
Where
then
should
I
fly
?
<EOS>
At
last
I
bethought
me
of
a
retreat
,
and
arranged
a
plan
of
escape
with
Elizabeth
Device
.
<EOS>
Vain
were
my
precautions
.
<EOS>
On
that
very
night
,
I
was
startled
from
slumber
by
a
sudden
cry
from
the
nurse
,
who
was
seated
by
the
fire
,
with
the
child
on
her
knees
.
<EOS>
It
was
long
past
midnight
,
and
all
the
household
were
at
rest
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
had
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
One
was
my
ruthless
husband
,
Richard
Nutter
;
the
other
was
John
Device
,
a
powerful
ruffianly
fellow
,
who
planted
himself
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Marching
quickly
towards
Elizabeth
,
who
had
arisen
on
seeing
him
,
my
husband
snatched
the
child
from
her
before
I
could
seize
it
,
and
with
a
violent
blow
on
the
chest
felled
me
to
the
ground
,
where
I
lay
helpless
,
speechless
.
<EOS>
With
reeling
senses
I
heard
Elizabeth
cry
out
that
it
was
her
own
child
,
and
call
upon
her
husband
to
save
it
.
<EOS>
Richard
Nutter
paused
,
but
re
-
assured
by
a
laugh
of
disbelief
from
his
ruffianly
follower
,
he
told
Elizabeth
the
pitiful
excuse
would
not
avail
to
save
the
brat
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
saw
a
weapon
gleam
--
there
was
a
feeble
piteous
cry
--
a
cry
that
might
have
moved
a
demon
--
but
it
did
not
move
_
<EOS>
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
With
wicked
words
and
blood
-
imbrued
hands
he
cast
the
body
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
horrid
sight
was
too
much
for
me
,
and
I
became
senseless
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
dreadful
tale
,
indeed
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
,
frozen
with
horror
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
crime
was
hidden
--
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
men
,
but
mark
the
retribution
that
followed
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
her
eyes
sparkling
with
vindictive
joy
.
<EOS>
"
Of
the
two
murderers
both
perished
miserably
.
<EOS>
John
Device
was
drowned
in
a
moss
-
pool
.
<EOS>
Richard
Nutter
's
end
was
terrible
,
sharpened
by
the
pangs
of
remorse
,
and
marked
by
frightful
suffering
.
<EOS>
But
another
dark
event
preceded
his
death
,
which
may
have
laid
a
crime
the
more
on
his
already
heavily
-
burdened
soul
.
<EOS>
Edward
Braddyll
,
the
object
of
his
jealousy
and
hate
,
suddenly
sickened
of
a
malady
so
strange
and
fearful
,
that
all
who
saw
him
affirmed
it
the
result
of
witchcraft
.
<EOS>
None
thought
of
my
husband
's
agency
in
the
dark
affair
except
myself
;
but
knowing
he
had
held
many
secret
conferences
about
the
time
with
Mother
Chattox
,
I
more
than
suspected
him
.
<EOS>
The
sick
man
died
;
and
from
that
hour
Richard
Nutter
knew
no
rest
.
<EOS>
Ever
on
horseback
,
or
fiercely
carousing
,
he
sought
in
vain
to
stifle
remorse
.
<EOS>
Visions
scared
him
by
night
,
and
vague
fears
pursued
him
by
day
.
<EOS>
He
would
start
at
shadows
,
and
talk
wildly
.
<EOS>
To
me
his
whole
demeanour
was
altered
;
and
he
strove
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
win
my
love
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
give
me
back
the
treasure
he
had
taken
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
to
life
my
murdered
babe
.
<EOS>
Like
his
victim
,
he
fell
ill
on
a
sudden
,
and
of
a
strange
and
terrible
sickness
.
<EOS>
I
saw
he
could
not
recover
,
and
therefore
tended
him
carefully
.
<EOS>
He
died
;
and
I
shed
no
tear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Alizon
,
"
though
guilty
,
I
can
not
but
compassionate
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
to
do
so
,
Alizon
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
rising
,
while
the
young
girl
rose
too
;
"
for
he
was
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
father
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
my
mother
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
--
I
am
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
straining
her
to
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
child!--my
dear
child
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
The
voice
of
nature
from
the
first
pleaded
eloquently
in
your
behalf
,
and
I
should
have
been
deaf
to
all
impulses
of
affection
if
I
had
not
listened
to
the
call
.
<EOS>
I
now
trace
in
every
feature
the
lineaments
of
the
babe
I
thought
lost
for
ever
.
<EOS>
All
is
clear
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
exclamation
of
Elizabeth
Device
,
which
,
like
my
ruthless
husband
,
I
looked
upon
as
an
artifice
to
save
the
infant
's
life
,
I
now
find
to
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Her
child
perished
instead
of
mine
.
<EOS>
How
or
why
she
exchanged
the
infants
on
that
night
remains
to
be
explained
,
but
that
she
did
so
is
certain
;
while
that
she
should
afterwards
conceal
the
circumstance
is
easily
comprehended
,
from
a
natural
dread
of
her
own
husband
as
well
as
of
mine
.
<EOS>
It
is
possible
that
from
some
cause
she
may
still
deny
the
truth
,
but
I
can
make
it
her
interest
to
speak
plainly
.
<EOS>
The
main
difficulty
will
lie
in
my
public
acknowledgment
of
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
whatever
cost
,
it
shall
be
made
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
consider
it
well
;
"
said
Alizon
,
"
I
will
be
your
daughter
in
love
--
in
duty
--
in
all
but
name
.
<EOS>
But
sully
not
my
poor
father
's
honour
,
which
even
at
the
peril
of
his
soul
he
sought
to
maintain
!
<EOS>
How
can
I
be
owned
as
your
daughter
without
involving
the
discovery
of
this
tragic
history
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Alizon
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
,
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
bring
the
dark
deed
to
light
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
never
return
to
Elizabeth
Device
.
<EOS>
You
shall
go
with
me
to
Rough
Lee
,
and
take
up
your
abode
in
the
house
where
I
was
once
so
wretched
--
but
where
I
shall
now
be
full
of
happiness
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
shall
see
the
dark
spots
on
the
hearth
,
which
I
took
to
be
your
blood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
not
mine
,
it
was
blood
spilt
by
my
father
,
"
said
Alizon
,
with
a
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
fancy
,
or
did
a
low
groan
break
upon
her
ear
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
imaginary
,
for
Mistress
Nutter
seemed
unconscious
of
the
dismal
sound
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
growing
rapidly
dark
,
and
the
more
distant
objects
in
the
room
were
wrapped
in
obscurity
;
but
Alizon
's
gaze
rested
on
the
two
monkish
figures
supporting
the
wardrobe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
there
,
mother
,
"
she
said
to
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
cried
the
lady
,
turning
round
quickly
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
.
<EOS>
You
alarm
yourself
needlessly
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
Those
are
only
carved
figures
of
two
brethren
of
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
They
are
said
,
I
know
not
with
what
truth
--
to
be
statues
of
John
Paslew
and
Borlace
Alvetham
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
stirred
,
"
said
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
mere
fancy
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
Calm
yourself
,
sweet
child
.
<EOS>
Let
us
think
of
other
things
--
of
our
newly
discovered
relationship
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
,
to
me
you
are
Millicent
Nutter
;
though
to
others
you
must
still
be
Alizon
Device
.
<EOS>
My
sweet
Millicent
,
"
she
cried
,
embracing
her
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
little
--
little
did
I
think
to
see
you
more
!
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
's
fears
were
speedily
chased
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
,
dear
mother
,
"
she
cried
,
"
if
I
have
failed
to
express
the
full
delight
I
experience
in
my
restitution
to
you
.
<EOS>
The
shock
of
your
sad
tale
at
first
deadened
my
joy
,
while
the
suddenness
of
the
information
respecting
myself
so
overwhelmed
me
,
that
like
one
chancing
upon
a
hidden
treasure
,
and
gazing
at
it
confounded
,
I
was
unable
to
credit
my
own
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
Even
now
I
am
quite
bewildered
;
and
no
wonder
,
for
many
thoughts
,
each
of
different
import
,
throng
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Independently
of
the
pleasure
and
natural
pride
<EOS>
I
must
feel
in
being
acknowledged
by
you
as
a
daughter
,
it
is
a
source
of
the
deepest
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
that
I
am
not
,
in
any
way
,
connected
with
Elizabeth
Device
--
not
from
her
humble
station
--
<EOS>
for
poverty
weighs
little
with
me
in
comparison
with
virtue
and
goodness
--
but
from
her
sinfulness
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
dark
offence
laid
to
her
charge
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
in
a
low
deep
tone
,
"
but
I
do
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
,
"
returned
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Still
,
she
acts
as
if
she
were
the
wicked
thing
she
is
called
;
avoids
all
religious
offices
;
shuns
all
places
of
worship
;
and
derides
the
Holy
Scriptures
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
mother
!
<EOS>
you
will
comprehend
the
frequent
conflict
of
feelings
I
must
have
endured
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
my
horror
when
I
have
sometimes
thought
myself
the
daughter
of
a
witch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
leave
her
if
you
thought
so
?
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
frowning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
leave
her
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
"
for
I
then
thought
her
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
fell
upon
her
daughter
's
neck
,
and
wept
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
an
excellent
heart
,
my
child
,
"
she
said
at
length
,
checking
her
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
complain
of
in
Elizabeth
Device
,
dear
mother
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
What
she
denied
herself
,
she
did
not
refuse
me
;
and
though
I
have
necessarily
many
and
great
deficiencies
,
you
will
find
in
me
,
I
trust
,
no
evil
principles
.
<EOS>
And
,
oh
!
shall
we
not
strive
to
rescue
that
poor
benighted
creature
from
the
pit
?
<EOS>
We
may
yet
save
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
in
a
sombre
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
too
late
,
"
said
Alizon
,
confidently
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
be
beyond
redemption
.
<EOS>
But
even
if
she
should
prove
intractable
,
poor
little
Jennet
may
be
preserved
.
<EOS>
She
is
yet
a
child
,
with
some
good
--
though
,
alas
!
<EOS>
much
evil
,
also
--
in
her
nature
.
<EOS>
Let
our
united
efforts
be
exerted
in
this
good
work
,
and
we
must
succeed
.
<EOS>
The
weeds
extirpated
,
the
flowers
will
spring
up
freely
,
and
bloom
in
beauty
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
in
a
freezing
<EOS>
tone--"nor
must
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
say
not
so
,
mother
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
You
rob
me
of
half
the
happiness
I
feel
in
being
restored
to
you
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
Jennets
sister
,
I
devoted
myself
to
the
task
of
reclaiming
her
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
to
be
her
guardian
angel
--
to
step
between
her
and
the
assaults
of
evil
--
and
I
can
not
,
will
not
,
now
abandon
her
.
<EOS>
If
no
longer
my
sister
,
she
is
still
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
recollect
that
I
owe
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
to
her
mother
--
a
debt
I
can
never
pay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
so
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
You
owe
her
nothing
--
but
the
contrary
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
owe
her
a
life
,
"
said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Was
not
her
infant
's
blood
poured
out
for
mine
!
<EOS>
And
shall
I
not
save
the
child
<EOS>
left
her
,
if
I
can
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
oppose
your
inclinations
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
reluctant
assent
;
"
but
Elizabeth
,
I
suspect
,
will
thank
you
little
for
your
interference
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Not
now
,
perhaps
,
"
returned
Alizon
;
"
but
a
time
will
come
when
she
will
do
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
this
conversation
took
place
,
it
had
been
rapidly
growing
dark
,
and
the
gloom
at
length
increased
so
much
,
that
the
speakers
could
scarcely
see
each
other
's
faces
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
and
portentous
darkness
was
accounted
for
by
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
,
followed
by
a
low
growl
of
thunder
rumbling
over
Whalley
Nab
.
<EOS>
The
mother
and
daughter
drew
close
together
,
and
Mistress
Nutter
passed
her
arm
round
Alizon
's
neck
.
 
<EOS>
The
storm
came
quickly
on
,
with
forked
and
dangerous
lightning
,
and
loud
claps
of
thunder
threatening
mischief
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
all
its
fury
seemed
collected
over
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
The
red
flashes
hissed
,
and
the
peals
of
thunder
rolled
overhead
.
<EOS>
But
other
terrors
were
added
to
Alizon
's
natural
dread
of
the
elemental
warfare
.
<EOS>
Again
she
fancied
the
two
monkish
figures
,
which
had
before
excited
her
alarm
,
moved
,
and
even
shook
their
arms
menacingly
at
her
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
attributed
this
wild
idea
to
her
overwrought
imagination
,
and
strove
to
convince
herself
of
its
fallacy
by
keeping
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
them
.
<EOS>
But
each
succeeding
flash
only
served
to
confirm
her
superstitious
apprehensions
.
 
<EOS>
Another
circumstance
contributed
to
heighten
her
alarm
.
<EOS>
Scared
most
probably
by
the
storm
,
a
large
white
owl
fluttered
down
the
chimney
,
and
after
wheeling
twice
or
thrice
round
the
chamber
,
settled
upon
the
bed
,
hooting
,
puffing
,
ruffling
its
feathers
,
and
glaring
at
her
with
eyes
that
glowed
like
fiery
coals
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
seemed
little
moved
by
the
storm
,
though
she
kept
a
profound
silence
,
but
when
Alizon
gazed
in
her
face
,
she
was
frightened
by
its
expression
,
which
reminded
her
of
the
terrible
aspect
she
had
worn
at
the
interview
with
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
Mistress
Nutter
arose
,
and
,
rapid
as
the
lightning
playing
around
her
and
revealing
her
movements
,
made
several
passes
,
with
extended
hands
,
over
her
daughter
;
and
on
this
the
latter
instantly
fell
back
,
as
if
fainting
,
though
still
retaining
her
consciousness
;
and
,
what
was
stranger
still
,
though
her
eyes
were
closed
,
her
power
of
sight
remained
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
condition
she
fancied
invisible
forms
were
moving
about
her
.
<EOS>
Strange
sounds
seemed
to
salute
her
ears
,
like
the
gibbering
of
ghosts
,
and
she
thought
she
felt
the
flapping
of
unseen
wings
around
her
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
her
attention
was
drawn
--
she
knew
not
why
--
towards
the
closet
,
and
from
out
it
she
fancied
she
saw
issue
the
tall
dark
figure
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
She
was
sure
she
saw
him
;
for
her
imagination
could
not
body
forth
features
charged
with
such
a
fiendish
expression
,
or
eyes
of
such
unearthly
lustre
.
<EOS>
He
was
clothed
in
black
,
but
the
fashion
of
his
raiments
was
unlike
aught
she
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
His
stature
was
gigantic
,
and
a
pale
phosphoric
light
enshrouded
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
advanced
,
forked
lightnings
shot
into
the
room
,
and
the
thunder
split
overhead
.
<EOS>
The
owl
hooted
fearfully
,
quitted
its
perch
,
and
flew
off
by
the
way
it
had
entered
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dark
Shape
came
on
.
<EOS>
It
stood
beside
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
she
prostrated
herself
before
it
.
<EOS>
The
gestures
of
the
figure
were
angry
and
imperious
--
those
of
Mistress
Nutter
supplicating
.
<EOS>
Their
converse
was
drowned
by
the
rattling
of
the
storm
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
figure
pointed
to
Alizon
,
and
the
word
"
midnight
"
broke
in
tones
louder
than
the
thunder
from
its
lips
.
<EOS>
All
consciousness
then
forsook
her
.
 
<EOS>
How
long
she
continued
in
this
state
she
knew
not
,
but
the
touch
of
a
finger
applied
to
her
brow
seemed
to
recall
her
suddenly
to
animation
.
<EOS>
She
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
looked
around
.
<EOS>
A
wondrous
change
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
storm
had
passed
off
,
and
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
over
the
top
of
the
cypress
-
tree
,
flooding
the
chamber
with
its
gentle
radiance
,
while
her
mother
was
bending
over
her
with
looks
of
tenderest
affection
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
better
now
,
sweet
child
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
overcome
by
the
storm
.
<EOS>
It
was
sudden
and
terrible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Terrible
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Alizon
,
imperfectly
recalling
what
had
passed
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
not
alone
the
storm
that
frightened
me
.
<EOS>
This
chamber
has
been
invaded
by
evil
beings
.
<EOS>
Methought
I
beheld
a
dark
figure
come
from
out
yon
closet
,
and
stand
before
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
thrown
into
a
state
of
stupor
by
the
influence
of
the
electric
fluid
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
while
in
that
condition
visions
have
passed
through
your
brain
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
,
my
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
hope
so
,
"
said
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
ecstasies
are
of
frequent
occurrence
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
since
you
are
quite
recovered
,
we
will
descend
to
Lady
Assheton
,
who
may
wonder
at
our
absence
.
<EOS>
You
will
share
this
room
with
me
to
-
night
,
my
child
;
for
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
you
can
not
return
to
Elizabeth
Device
.
<EOS>
I
will
make
all
needful
explanations
to
Lady
Assheton
,
and
will
see
Elizabeth
in
the
morning
--
perhaps
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Reassure
yourself
,
sweet
child
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
to
fear
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
not
,
mother
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
would
ease
my
mind
to
look
into
that
closet
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
so
,
then
,
by
all
means
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
with
a
forced
smile
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
peeped
timorously
into
the
little
room
,
which
was
lighted
up
by
the
moon
's
rays
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
faded
white
habit
,
like
the
robe
of
a
Cistertian
monk
,
hanging
in
one
corner
,
and
beneath
it
an
old
chest
.
<EOS>
Alizon
would
fain
have
opened
the
chest
,
but
Mistress
Nutter
called
out
to
her
impatiently
,
"
You
will
discover
nothing
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
Come
,
let
us
go
down
-
stairs
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
they
quitted
the
room
together
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IX.--THE
TWO
PORTRAITS
IN
THE
BANQUETING
-
HALL
.
  
<EOS>
The
banqueting
-
hall
lay
immediately
under
the
long
gallery
,
corresponding
with
it
in
all
but
height
;
and
though
in
this
respect
it
fell
somewhat
short
of
the
magnificent
upper
room
,
it
was
quite
lofty
enough
to
admit
of
a
gallery
of
its
own
for
spectators
and
minstrels
.
<EOS>
Great
pains
had
been
taken
in
decorating
the
hall
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Between
the
forest
of
stags
'
horns
that
branched
from
the
gallery
rails
were
hung
rich
carpets
,
intermixed
with
garlands
of
flowers
,
and
banners
painted
with
the
arms
of
the
Assheton
family
,
were
suspended
from
the
corners
.
<EOS>
Over
the
fireplace
,
where
,
despite
the
advanced
season
,
a
pile
of
turf
and
wood
was
burning
,
were
hung
two
panoplies
of
arms
,
and
above
them
,
on
a
bracket
,
was
set
a
complete
suit
of
mail
,
once
belonging
to
Richard
Assheton
,
the
first
possessor
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
wall
hung
two
remarkable
portraits
--
the
one
representing
a
religious
votaress
in
a
loose
robe
of
black
,
with
wide
sleeves
,
holding
a
rosary
and
missal
in
her
hand
,
and
having
her
brow
and
neck
entirely
concealed
by
the
wimple
,
in
which
her
head
and
shoulders
were
enveloped
.
<EOS>
Such
of
her
features
as
could
be
seen
were
of
extraordinary
loveliness
,
though
of
a
voluptuous
character
,
the
eyes
being
dark
and
languishing
,
and
shaded
by
long
lashes
,
and
the
lips
carnation
-
hued
and
full
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
fair
votaress
,
Isole
de
Heton
,
who
brought
such
scandal
on
the
Abbey
in
the
reign
of
Henry
VI
.
<EOS>
The
other
portrait
was
that
of
an
abbot
,
in
the
white
gown
and
scapulary
of
the
Cistertian
order
.
<EOS>
The
countenance
was
proud
and
stern
,
but
tinctured
with
melancholy
.
<EOS>
In
a
small
shield
at
one
corner
the
arms
were
blazoned
--
argent
,
a
fess
between
three
mullets
,
sable
,
pierced
of
the
field
,
a
crescent
for
difference
--
proving
it
to
be
the
portrait
of
John
Paslew
.
<EOS>
Both
pictures
had
been
found
in
the
abbot
's
lodgings
,
when
taken
possession
of
by
Richard
Assheton
,
but
they
owed
their
present
position
to
his
descendant
,
Sir
Ralph
,
who
discovering
them
in
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
closet
,
where
they
had
been
cast
aside
,
and
struck
with
their
extraordinary
merit
,
hung
them
up
as
above
stated
.
 
<EOS>
The
long
oaken
table
,
usually
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
had
been
removed
to
one
side
,
to
allow
free
scope
for
dancing
and
other
pastimes
,
but
it
was
still
devoted
to
hospitable
uses
,
being
covered
with
trenchers
and
drinking
-
cups
,
and
spread
for
a
substantial
repast
.
<EOS>
Near
it
stood
two
carvers
,
with
aprons
round
their
waists
,
brandishing
long
knives
,
while
other
yeomen
of
the
kitchen
and
cellar
were
at
hand
to
keep
the
trenchers
well
supplied
,
and
the
cups
filled
with
strong
ale
,
or
bragget
,
as
might
suit
the
taste
of
the
guests
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
these
the
only
festive
preparations
.
<EOS>
The
upper
part
of
the
hall
was
reserved
for
Sir
Ralph
's
immediate
friends
,
and
here
,
on
a
slightly
raised
elevation
,
stood
a
cross
table
,
spread
for
a
goodly
supper
,
the
snowy
napery
being
ornamented
with
wreaths
and
ropes
of
flowers
,
and
shining
with
costly
vessels
.
<EOS>
At
the
lower
end
of
the
room
,
beneath
the
gallery
,
which
it
served
to
support
,
was
a
Gothic
screen
,
embellishing
an
open
armoury
,
which
made
a
grand
display
of
silver
plates
and
flagons
.
<EOS>
Through
one
of
the
doorways
contrived
in
this
screen
,
the
May
-
day
revellers
were
ushered
into
the
hall
by
old
Adam
Whitworth
,
the
white
-
headed
steward
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
pray
you
be
seated
,
good
masters
,
and
you
<EOS>
,
too
,
comely
dames
,
"
said
Adam
,
leading
them
to
the
table
,
and
assigning
each
a
place
with
his
wand
.
<EOS>
"
Fall
to
,
and
spare
not
,
for
it
is
my
honoured
master
's
desire
you
should
sup
well
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
that
venison
pasty
worth
a
trial
,
and
the
baked
red
deer
in
the
centre
of
the
table
is
a
noble
dish
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
to
it
was
served
at
Sir
Ralph
's
own
table
at
dinner
,
and
was
pronounced
excellent
.
<EOS>
I
pray
you
try
it
,
masters.--Here
,
<EOS>
Ned
Scargill
,
mind
your
office
,
good
fellow
,
and
break
me
that
deer
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
Paul
Pimlot
,
exercise
your
craft
on
the
venison
pasty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
trencher
after
trencher
was
rapidly
filled
by
the
two
carvers
,
who
demeaned
themselves
in
their
task
like
men
acquainted
with
the
powers
of
rustic
appetite
,
the
old
steward
addressed
himself
to
the
dames
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
fair
mistresses
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Here
be
sack
possets
,
junkets
and
cream
,
for
such
as
like
them
--
French
puffs
and
Italian
puddings
,
right
good
,
I
warrant
you
,
and
especially
admired
by
my
honourable
good
lady
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
not
sure
she
hath
not
lent
a
hand
herself
in
their
preparation
.
<EOS>
Then
here
be
fritters
in
the
court
fashion
,
made
with
curds
of
sack
posset
,
eggs
and
ale
,
and
seasoned
with
nutmeg
and
pepper
.
<EOS>
You
will
taste
them
,
I
am
sure
,
for
they
are
favourites
with
our
sovereign
lady
,
the
queen
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Gregory
,
Dickon
--
bestir
yourselves
,
knaves
,
and
pour
forth
a
cup
of
sack
for
each
of
these
dames
.
<EOS>
As
you
drink
,
mistresses
,
neglect
not
the
health
of
our
honourable
good
master
Sir
Ralph
,
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
--
it
is
well
.
<EOS>
I
will
convey
to
them
both
your
dutiful
good
wishes
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
see
all
your
wants
supplied
.
<EOS>
Good
Dame
Openshaw
,
you
have
nought
before
you
.
<EOS>
Be
prevailed
upon
to
taste
these
dropt
raisins
or
a
fond
pudding
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
too
,
sweet
Dame
Tetlow
.
<EOS>
Squire
Nicholas
gave
me
special
caution
to
take
care
of
you
,
but
the
injunction
was
unneeded
,
as
I
should
have
done
so
without
it.--Another
cup
of
canary
to
Dame
Tetlow
,
Gregory
.
<EOS>
Fill
to
the
brim
,
knave
--
to
the
very
brim
.
<EOS>
To
the
health
of
Squire
Nicholas
,
"
he
added
in
a
low
tone
,
as
he
handed
the
brimming
goblet
to
the
blushing
dame
;
"
and
be
sure
and
tell
him
,
if
he
questions
you
,
that
I
obeyed
his
behests
to
the
best
of
my
ability
.
<EOS>
I
pray
you
taste
this
pippin
jelly
,
dame
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
red
as
rubies
,
but
not
so
red
as
your
lips
,
or
some
leach
of
almonds
,
which
,
lily
-
white
though
it
be
,
is
not
to
be
compared
with
the
teeth
that
shall
touch
it

"

"
Odd

replied

,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
the
recollection
of
something
<EOS>
said
to
me
by
him
,
brought
to
mind
by
your
presence
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Adam
Whitworth
,
gallantly
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
serve
you
in
aught
else
,
sign
to
me
,
dame.--Now
,
knaves
,
fill
the
cups
--
ale
or
bragget
,
at
your
pleasure
,
masters
.
<EOS>
Drink
and
stint
not
,
and
you
will
the
better
please
your
liberal
entertainer
and
my
honoured
master
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
exhorted
,
the
guests
set
seriously
to
work
to
fulfil
the
hospitable
intentions
of
the
provider
of
the
feast
.
<EOS>
Cups
flowed
fast
and
freely
,
and
erelong
little
was
left
of
the
venison
pasty
but
the
outer
crust
,
and
nothing
more
than
a
few
fragments
of
the
baked
red
deer
.
<EOS>
The
lighter
articles
then
came
in
for
a
share
of
attention
,
and
salmon
from
the
Ribble
,
jack
,
trout
,
and
eels
from
the
Hodder
and
Calder
,
boiled
,
broiled
,
stewed
,
and
pickled
,
and
of
delicious
flavour
,
were
discussed
with
infinite
relish
.
<EOS>
Puddings
and
pastry
were
left
to
more
delicate
stomachs
--
the
solids
only
being
in
request
with
the
men
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
the
demolition
of
the
viands
had
given
sufficient
employment
,
but
now
the
edge
of
appetite
beginning
to
be
dulled
,
tongues
were
unloosed
,
and
much
merriment
prevailed
.
<EOS>
More
than
eighty
in
number
,
the
guests
were
dispersed
without
any
regard
to
order
,
and
thus
the
chief
actors
in
the
revel
were
scattered
promiscuously
about
the
table
,
diversifying
it
with
their
gay
costumes
.
<EOS>
Robin
Hood
sat
between
two
pretty
female
morris
-
dancers
,
whose
partners
had
got
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
;
while
Ned
Huddlestone
,
the
representative
of
Friar
Tuck
,
was
equally
fortunate
,
having
a
buxom
dame
on
either
side
of
him
,
towards
whom
he
distributed
his
favours
with
singular
impartiality
.
<EOS>
As
porter
to
the
Abbey
,
Ned
made
himself
at
home
;
and
,
next
to
Adam
Whitworth
,
was
perhaps
the
most
important
personage
present
,
continually
roaring
for
ale
,
and
pledging
the
damsels
around
him
.
<EOS>
From
the
way
he
went
on
,
it
seemed
highly
probable
he
would
be
under
the
table
before
supper
was
over
;
but
Ned
Huddlestone
,
like
the
burly
priest
whose
gown
he
wore
,
had
a
stout
bullet
head
,
proof
against
all
assaults
of
liquor
;
and
the
copious
draughts
he
swallowed
,
instead
of
subduing
him
,
only
tended
to
make
him
more
uproarious
.
<EOS>
Blessed
also
with
lusty
lungs
,
his
shouts
of
laughter
made
the
roof
ring
again
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
strong
liquor
failed
to
make
due
impression
upon
him
,
the
like
can
not
be
said
of
Jack
Roby
,
who
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
took
the
part
of
the
Fool
,
and
who
,
having
drunk
overmuch
,
mistook
the
hobby
-
horse
for
a
real
steed
,
and
in
an
effort
to
bestride
it
,
fell
head
-
foremost
on
the
floor
,
and
,
being
found
incapable
of
rising
,
was
carried
out
to
an
adjoining
room
,
and
laid
on
a
bench
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
the
only
case
of
excess
;
for
though
the
Sherwood
foresters
emptied
their
cups
often
enough
to
heighten
their
mirth
,
none
of
them
seemed
the
worse
for
what
they
drank
.
<EOS>
Lawrence
Blackrod
,
Mr.
Parker
's
keeper
,
had
fortunately
got
next
to
his
old
flame
,
Sukey
Worseley
;
while
Phil
Rawson
,
the
forester
,
who
enacted
Will
Scarlet
,
and
Nancy
Holt
,
between
whom
an
equally
tender
feeling
subsisted
,
had
likewise
got
together
.
<EOS>
A
little
beyond
them
sat
the
gentleman
usher
and
parish
clerk
,
Sampson
Harrop
,
who
,
piquing
himself
on
his
good
manners
,
drank
very
sparingly
,
and
was
content
to
sup
on
sweetmeats
and
a
bowl
of
fleetings
,
as
curds
separated
from
whey
are
termed
in
this
district
.
<EOS>
Tom
the
piper
,
and
his
companion
the
taborer
,
ate
for
the
next
week
,
but
were
somewhat
more
sparing
in
the
matter
of
drink
,
their
services
as
minstrels
being
required
later
on
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
various
guests
enjoyed
themselves
according
to
their
bent
,
and
universal
hilarity
prevailed
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
strange
indeed
if
it
had
been
otherwise
;
for
what
with
the
good
cheer
,
and
the
bright
eyes
around
them
,
the
rustics
had
attained
a
point
of
felicity
not
likely
to
be
surpassed
.
<EOS>
Of
the
numerous
assemblage
more
than
half
were
of
the
fairer
sex
;
and
of
these
the
greater
portion
were
young
and
good
-
looking
,
while
in
the
case
of
the
morris
-
dancers
,
their
natural
charms
were
heightened
by
their
fanciful
attire
.
 
<EOS>
Before
supper
was
half
over
,
it
became
so
dark
that
it
was
found
necessary
to
illuminate
the
great
lamp
suspended
from
the
centre
of
the
roof
,
while
other
lights
were
set
on
the
board
,
and
two
flaming
torches
placed
in
sockets
on
either
side
of
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
was
this
accomplished
when
the
storm
came
on
,
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
weatherwise
,
who
had
not
calculated
upon
such
an
occurrence
,
not
having
seen
any
indications
whatever
of
it
in
the
heavens
.
<EOS>
But
all
were
too
comfortably
sheltered
,
and
too
well
employed
,
to
pay
much
attention
to
what
was
going
on
without
;
and
,
unless
when
a
flash
of
lightning
more
than
usually
vivid
dazzled
the
gaze
,
or
a
peal
of
thunder
more
appalling
than
the
rest
broke
overhead
,
no
alarm
was
expressed
,
even
by
the
women
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
a
little
pretty
trepidation
was
now
and
then
evinced
by
the
younger
damsels
;
but
even
this
was
only
done
with
the
view
of
exacting
attention
on
the
part
of
their
swains
,
and
never
failed
in
effect
.
<EOS>
The
thunder
-
storm
,
therefore
,
instead
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
general
enjoyment
,
only
tended
to
increase
it
.
<EOS>
However
the
last
peal
was
loud
enough
to
silence
the
most
uproarious
.
<EOS>
The
women
turned
pale
,
and
the
men
looked
at
each
other
anxiously
,
listening
to
hear
if
any
damage
had
been
done
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
nothing
transpired
,
their
spirits
revived
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
afterwards
word
was
brought
that
the
Conventual
Church
had
been
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
,
but
this
was
not
regarded
as
a
very
serious
disaster
.
<EOS>
The
bearer
of
the
intelligence
was
little
Jennet
,
who
said
she
had
been
caught
in
the
ruins
by
the
storm
,
and
after
being
dreadfully
frightened
by
the
lightning
,
had
seen
a
bolt
strike
the
steeple
,
and
heard
some
stones
rattle
down
,
after
which
she
ran
away
.
<EOS>
No
one
thought
of
inquiring
what
she
had
been
doing
there
at
the
time
,
but
room
was
made
for
her
at
the
supper
-
table
next
to
Sampson
Harrop
,
while
the
good
steward
,
patting
her
on
the
head
,
filled
her
a
cup
of
canary
with
his
own
hand
,
and
gave
her
some
cates
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
dunna
see
Alizon
"
observed
the
little
girl
,
looking
round
the
table
,
after
she
had
drunk
the
wine
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
is
not
here
,
Jennet
,
"
replied
Adam
Whitworth
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
too
great
a
lady
for
us
now
.
<EOS>
Since
she
came
up
with
her
ladyship
from
the
green
she
has
been
treated
quite
like
one
of
the
guests
,
and
has
been
walking
about
the
garden
and
ruins
all
the
afternoon
with
young
Mistress
Dorothy
,
who
has
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
her
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
all
the
ladies
seem
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
her
,
and
she
is
now
closeted
with
Mistress
Nutter
in
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
Jennet
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
'll
be
hard
to
please
when
she
goes
home
again
,
after
playing
the
fine
dame
here
,
"
pursued
the
steward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
ey
hope
she
'll
never
come
home
again
,
"
rejoined
Jennet
;
spitefully
,
"
fo
'
we
dunna
want
fine
dames
<EOS>
i
'
our
poor
cottage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
I
do
not
wonder
Alizon
pleases
the
gentle
folks
,
"
observed
Sampson
Harrop
,
"
since
such
pains
have
been
taken
with
her
manners
and
education
;
and
I
must
say
she
does
great
credit
to
her
instructor
,
who
,
for
reasons
unnecessary
to
mention
,
shall
be
nameless
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same
for
you
,
Jennet
;
but
though
you
're
not
deficient
in
ability
,
you
've
no
perseverance
or
pleasure
in
study
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
<EOS>

<EOS>

"
replied
Jennet
,
"
an
more
than
yo

teach
me
,
Mester
Harrop
.
<EOS>
Why
is
Alizon
always
to
be
thrown
<EOS>
i
'
my
teeth
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
she
's
the
best
model
you
can
have
,
"
rejoined
Sampson
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
if
I
'd
my
own
way
wi
'
ye
,
lass
,
I
'd
mend
your
temper
and
manners

<EOS>
But
you

ye
saucy
hussy

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

'
th
'
same
stock
as
Alizon
,
onny
<EOS>
how
,
"
said
Jennet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Unluckily
that
can
not
be
denied
,
"
replied
Sampson
;
"
but
you
're
as
different
from
her
as
light
from
darkness
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Jennet
eyed
him
bitterly
,
and
then
rose
from
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'n
go
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
no
;
sit
down
,
"
interposed
the
good
-
natured
steward
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
dancing
and
pastimes
will
begin
presently
,
and
you
will
see
your
sister
.
<EOS>
She
will
come
down
with
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
very
reason
she
wishes
to
go
,
"
said
Sampson
Harrop
.
<EOS>
"
The
spiteful
little
creature
can
not
bear
to
see
her
sister
better
treated
than
herself
.
<EOS>
Go
your
ways
,
then
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
best
thing
you
can
do
.
<EOS>
Alizon
would
blush
to
see
you
here

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
ey'n
een

vex

"
replied
Jennet
,
sharply
;
"

<EOS>
"
You

Master
Harrop
,
"
said
the
steward
,
laughing
,
as
the
little
girl
walked
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
account
it
a
disgrace
to
bandy
words
with
the
like
of

,
Adam
,
"
rejoined
the
clerk
,
angrily
;
"
but
I
'm
greatly
out
in
my
reckoning
,
if
she
does
not
make
a
second
Mother
Demdike

and
worse
could
not
well
befall
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jennet
's
society
could
have
been
very
well
dispensed
with
by
her
two
friends
,
but
she
would
not
be
shaken
off
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
finding
herself
in
the
way
,
she
only
determined
the
more
pertinaciously
to
remain
,
and
began
to
exercise
all
her
powers
of
teasing
,
which
have
been
described
as
considerable
,
and
which
on
this
occasion
proved
eminently
successful
.
<EOS>
And
the
worst
of
it
was
,
there
was
no
crushing
<EOS>
the
plaguy
little
insect
;
any
effort
made
to
catch
her
only
resulting
in
an
escape
on
her
part
,
and
a
new
charge
on
some
undefended
quarter
,
with
sharper
stinging
and
more
intolerable
buzzing
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Out
of
all
patience
,
Sukey
Worseley
at
length
exclaimed
,
"
Ey

,

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed

Sukey
,
"
said
Blackrod
,
unable
to
resist
a
laugh
,
though
the
poor
girl
was
greatly
discomfited
by
this
personal
allusion
;
"
ye
may

"
 
<EOS>
This
assurance
was
a
balm
to
poor
Sukey
's
wounded
spirit
,
and
she
replied
with
a
well
-
pleased
smile
,
"

Not

lifting

said
Phil

putting

drawing

gently
down

said
Nancy
Holt
,
noticing
with
alarm
the
malignant
look
fixed
upon
her
lover
by
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
She

"
 
<EOS>
"

Phil

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
The
latter
observation
was
occasioned
by
the
entrance
of
a
tall
personage
,
in
the
garb
of
a
Cistertian
monk
,
who
issued
from
one
of
the
doorways
in
the
screen
,
and
glided
towards
the
upper
table
,
attracting
general
attention
and
misgiving
as
he
proceeded
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
cadaverous
,
his
lips
livid
,
and
his
eyes
black
and
deep
sunken
in
their
sockets
,
with
a
bistre
-
coloured
circle
around
them
.
<EOS>
His
frame
was
meagre
and
bony
.
<EOS>
What
remained
of
hair
on
his
head
was
raven
black
,
but
either
he
was
bald
on
the
crown
,
or
carried
his
attention
to
costume
so
far
as
to
adopt
the
priestly
tonsure
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
was
lofty
and
sallow
,
and
seemed
stamped
,
like
his
features
,
with
profound
gloom
.
<EOS>
His
garments
were
faded
and
mouldering
,
and
materially
contributed
to
his
ghostly
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Sukey
and
Nance
together
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
one
could
answer
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
dusna

loike
a
bein
'
o
'
this
warld
,
"
observed
Blackrod
,
gaping
with
alarm
,
for
the
stout
keeper
was
easily
assailable
on
the
side
of
superstition
;
"
an
there
is
a
mowdy
air
about
him
,
that
gies
one
the
shivers
to
see
.
<EOS>
Ey've
often
heer'd
say
the

an
that
pale

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
An

cried
Phil
Rawson
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Is

said
Sukey
,
drawing
nearer
to
the
stalwart
keeper
.

ejaculated
Nancy

,
pressing
close
to
her

side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eigh

rejoined
the
forester
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

tenderly

<EOS>
"
Then

"
replied
Phil
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ghost

said
Jennet
,
who
had
been
occupied
in
regarding
the
new
-
comer
attentively
,
"

<EOS>
"

"
said
Blackrod
,
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
in
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Adam
Whitworth
,
coming
up
at
the
moment
,
and
overhearing
what
was
said--"you
must
not
go
near
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
him
molested
,
or
even
spoken
with
,
till
Sir
Ralph
appears
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
stranger
,
without
returning
the
glances
fixed
upon
him
,
or
deigning
to
notice
any
of
the
company
,
pursued
his
way
,
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
at
the
upper
table
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
entrance
had
been
witnessed
by
others
besides
the
rustic
guests
and
servitors
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
and
Richard
Assheton
chanced
to
be
in
the
gallery
at
the
time
,
and
,
greatly
struck
by
the
singularity
of
his
appearance
,
immediately
descended
to
make
inquiries
respecting
him
.
<EOS>
As
they
appeared
below
,
the
old
steward
advanced
to
meet
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
<EOS>
the
devil
have
you
got
there
,
Adam
?
"
asked
the
squire
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
passeth
me
almost
to
tell
you
,
Master
Nicholas
,
"
replied
the
steward
;
"
and
,
not
knowing
whether
the
gentleman
be
invited
or
not
,
I
am
fain
to
wait
Sir
Ralph
's
pleasure
in
regard
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
notion
who
he
is
?
"
inquired
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
I
know
about
him
may
be
soon
told
,
Master
Richard
,
"
replied
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
stranger
in
these
parts
,
and
hath
very
recently
taken
up
his
abode
in
Wiswall
Hall
,
which
has
been
abandoned
of
late
years
,
as
you
know
,
and
suffered
to
go
to
decay
.
<EOS>
Some
few
months
ago
an
aged
couple
from
Colne
,
named
Hewit
,
took
possession
of
part
of
the
hall
,
and
were
suffered
to
remain
there
,
though
old
Katty
Hewit
,
or
Mould
-
heels
,
as
she
is
familiarly
termed
by
the
common
folk
,
is
in
no
very
good
repute
hereabouts
,
and
was
driven
,
it
is
said
from
Colne
,
owing
to
her
practices
as
a
witch
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
soon
after
these
Hewits
were
settled
at
Wiswall
,
comes
this
stranger
,
and
fixes
himself
in
another
part
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
How
he
lives
no
one
can
tell
,
but
it
is
said
he
rambles
all
night
long
,
like
a
troubled
spirit
,
about
the
deserted
rooms
,
attended
by
Mother
Mould
-
heels
;
while
in
the
daytime
he
is
never
seen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
he
be
of
sound
mind
?
"
asked
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hardly
so
,
I
should
think
,
Master
Richard
,
"
replied
the
steward
.
<EOS>
"
As
to
who
he
may
be
there
are
many
opinions
;
and
some
aver
he
is
Francis
Paslew
,
grandson
of
Francis
,
brother
to
the
abbot
,
and
being
a
Jesuit
priest
,
for
you
know
the
Paslews
have
all
strictly
adhered
to
the
old
faith
--
and
that
is
why
they
have
fled
the
country
and
abandoned
their
residence
--
he
is
obliged
to
keep
himself
concealed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
such
be
the
case
,
he
must
be
crazed
indeed
to
venture
here
,
"
observed
Nicholas
;
"
and
yet
I
am
half
inclined
to
credit
the
report
.
<EOS>
Look
at
him
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
very
image
of
the
old
abbot
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Yon
portrait
might
have
been
painted
for
him
,
"
said
Richard
,
gazing
at
the
picture
on
the
wall
,
and
from
it
to
the
monk
as
he
spoke
;
"
the
very
same
garb
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
an
old
monastic
robe
up
-
stairs
,
in
the
closet
adjoining
the
room
occupied
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
observed
the
steward
,
"
said
to
be
the
garment
in
which
Abbot
Paslew
suffered
death
.
<EOS>
Some
stains
are
upon
it
,
supposed
to
be
the
blood
of
the
wizard
Demdike
,
who
perished
in
an
extraordinary
manner
on
the
same
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
it
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
"
and
the
monk
's
habit
looks
precisely
like
it
,
and
,
if
my
eyes
deceive
me
not
,
is
stained
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
the
spots
plainly
on
the
breast
,
"
cried
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
he
have
procured
the
robe
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
only
knows
,
"
replied
the
old
steward
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
strange
occurrence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
question
him
,
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
proceeded
to
the
upper
table
,
accompanied
by
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
As
they
drew
near
,
the
stranger
arose
,
and
fixed
a
grim
look
upon
Richard
,
who
was
a
little
in
advance
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
abbot
's
ghost
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
,
stopping
,
and
detaining
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
address
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
During
the
contention
that
ensued
,
the
monk
glided
towards
a
side
-
door
at
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
,
and
passed
through
it
.
<EOS>
So
general
was
the
consternation
,
that
no
one
attempted
to
stay
him
,
nor
would
any
one
follow
to
see
whither
he
went
.
<EOS>
Released
,
at
length
,
from
the
strong
grasp
of
the
squire
,
Richard
rushed
forth
,
and
not
returning
,
Nicholas
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
,
went
in
search
of
him
,
but
came
back
presently
,
and
told
the
old
steward
he
could
neither
find
him
nor
the
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Master
Richard
will
be
back
anon
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
Adam
,
"
he
remarked
;
"
if
not
,
I
will
make
further
search
for
him
;
but
you
had
better
not
mention
this
mysterious
occurrence
to
Sir
Ralph
,
at
all
events
not
until
the
festivities
are
over
,
and
the
ladies
have
retired
.
<EOS>
It
might
disturb
them
.
<EOS>
I
fear
the
appearance
of
this
monk
bodes
no
good
to
our
family
;
and
what
makes
it
worse
is
,
it
is
not
the
first
ill
omen
that
has
befallen
us
to
-
day
,
Master
Richard
was
unlucky
enough
to
stand
on
Abbot
Paslew
's
grave
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
that
was
unlucky
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Adam
,
in
great
trepidation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
dear
young
gentleman
!
<EOS>
Bid
him
take
especial
care
of
himself
,
good
Master
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
just
now
,
that
yon
fearsome
monk
regarded
him
more
attentively
than
you
.
<EOS>
Bid
him
be
careful
<EOS>
,
I
conjure
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
But
here
comes
my
honoured
master
and
his
guests
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Gregory
,
Dickon
,
bestir
yourselves
,
knaves
;
and
serve
supper
at
the
upper
table
in
a
trice
.
"
 
<EOS>
Any
apprehensions
Nicholas
might
entertain
for
Richard
were
at
this
moment
relieved
,
for
as
Sir
Ralph
and
his
guests
came
in
at
one
door
,
the
young
man
entered
by
another
.
<EOS>
He
looked
deathly
pale
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
in
token
of
silence
--
a
gesture
which
the
other
signified
that
he
understood
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
and
his
guests
having
taken
their
places
at
the
table
,
an
excellent
and
plentiful
repast
was
speedily
set
before
them
,
and
if
they
did
not
do
quite
such
ample
justice
to
it
as
the
hungry
rustics
at
the
lower
board
had
done
to
the
good
things
provided
for
them
,
the
cook
could
not
reasonably
complain
.
<EOS>
No
allusion
whatever
being
made
to
the
recent
strange
occurrence
,
the
cheerfulness
of
the
company
was
uninterrupted
;
but
the
noise
in
the
lower
part
of
the
hall
had
in
a
great
measure
subsided
,
partly
out
of
respect
to
the
host
,
and
partly
in
consequence
of
the
alarm
occasioned
by
the
supposed
supernatural
visitation
.
<EOS>
Richard
continued
silent
and
preoccupied
,
and
neither
ate
nor
drank
;
but
Nicholas
appearing
to
think
his
courage
would
be
best
sustained
by
an
extra
allowance
of
clary
and
sack
,
applied
himself
frequently
to
the
goblet
with
that
view
,
and
erelong
his
spirits
improved
so
wonderfully
,
and
his
natural
boldness
was
so
much
increased
,
that
he
was
ready
to
confront
Abbot
Paslew
,
or
any
other
abbot
of
them
all
,
wherever
they
might
chance
to
cross
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
enterprising
frame
of
mind
he
drew
Richard
aside
,
and
questioned
him
as
to
what
had
taken
place
in
his
pursuit
of
the
mysterious
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
overtook
him
,
Dick
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
and
put
it
to
him
roundly
why
he
came
hither
,
where
neither
ghosts
nor
Jesuit
priests
,
whichever
he
may
be
,
are
wanted
.
<EOS>
What
answered
he
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Would
I
had
been
there
to
interrogate
him
!
<EOS>
He
should
have
declared
how
he
became
possessed
of
that
old
moth
-
eaten
,
blood
-
stained
,
monkish
gown
,
or
I
would
have
unfrocked
him
,
even
if
he
had
proved
to
be
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
But
I
interrupt
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
told
me
what
occurred
at
the
interview
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
interview
,
"
replied
Richard
,
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
interview
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
S'blood
<EOS>
,
man!--but
<EOS>
I
must
be
careful
,
for
Doctor
Ormerod
and
Parson
Dewhurst
are
within
hearing
,
and
may
lecture
me
on
the
wantonness
and
profanity
of
swearing
.
<EOS>
By
Saint
Gregory
de
Northbury!--no
,
that
's
an
oath
too
,
and
,
what
is
worse
,
a
Popish
oath
.
<EOS>
By
--
I
have
several
tremendous
imprecations
at
my
tongue
's
end
,
but
they
shall
not
out
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sinful
propensity
,
and
must
be
controlled
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
then
,
you
let
him
escape
,
Dick
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
so
anxious
to
stay
him
,
I
wonder
you
came
not
with
me
,
"
replied
Richard
;
"
but
you
now
hold
very
different
language
from
what
you
used
when
I
quitted
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
true
--
right
--
Dick
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
my
sentiments
have
undergone
a
wonderful
change
since
then
.
<EOS>
I
now
regret
having
stopped
you
.
<EOS>
By
my
troth
!
<EOS>
if
I
meet
that
confounded
monk
again
,
he
shall
give
a
good
account
of
himself
,
I
promise
him
.
<EOS>
But
what
said
he
to
you
,
Dick
?
<EOS>
Make
an
end
of
your
story
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
begun
it
yet
,
"
replied
Richard
.
"
<EOS>
But
pay
attention
,
and
you
shall
hear
what
occurred
.
<EOS>
When
I
rushed
forth
,
the
monk
had
already
gained
the
entrance
-
hall
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
within
it
at
the
time
,
all
the
serving
-
men
being
busied
here
with
the
feasting
.
<EOS>
I
summoned
him
to
stay
,
but
he
answered
not
,
and
,
still
grimly
regarding
me
,
glided
towards
the
outer
door
,
which
(
I
know
not
by
what
chance
)
stood
open
,
and
passing
through
it
,
closed
it
upon
me
.
<EOS>
This
delayed
me
a
moment
;
and
when
I
got
out
,
he
had
already
descended
the
steps
,
and
was
moving
towards
the
garden
.
<EOS>
It
was
bright
moonlight
,
so
I
could
see
him
distinctly
.
<EOS>
And
mark
this
,
Nicholas
--
the
two
great
blood
-
hounds
were
running
about
at
large
in
the
court
-
yard
,
but
they
slunk
off
,
as
if
alarmed
at
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
monk
had
now
gained
the
garden
,
and
was
shaping
his
course
swiftly
towards
the
ruined
Conventual
Church
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
overtake
him
,
I
quickened
my
pace
;
but
he
gained
the
old
fane
before
me
,
and
threaded
the
broken
aisles
with
noiseless
celerity
.
<EOS>
In
the
choir
he
paused
and
confronted
me
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
few
yards
of
him
,
I
paused
,
arrested
by
his
fixed
and
terrible
gaze
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
his
look
froze
my
blood
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
spoken
,
but
I
could
not
.
<EOS>
My
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
for
very
fear
.
<EOS>
Before
I
could
shake
off
this
apprehension
the
figure
raised
its
hand
menacingly
thrice
,
and
passed
into
the
Lacy
Chapel
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
my
courage
returned
,
and
I
followed
.
<EOS>
The
little
chapel
was
brilliantly
illuminated
by
the
moon
;
but
it
was
empty
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
see
the
white
monument
of
Sir
Henry
de
Lacy
glistening
in
the
pale
radiance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
a
cup
of
wine
after
this
horrific
relation
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
replenishing
his
goblet
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
chilled
my
blood
,
as
the
monk
's
icy
gaze
froze
yours
.
<EOS>
Body
o
'
me
!
<EOS>
but
this
is
strange
indeed
.
<EOS>
Another
oath
.
<EOS>
Lord
help
me!--I
shall
never
get
rid
of
the
infernal
--
I
mean
,
the
evil
habit
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
pledge
me
,
Dick
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
wrong
,
"
pursued
Nicholas,--"decidedly
wrong
.
<EOS>
Wine
gladdeneth
the
heart
of
man
,
and
restoreth
courage
.
<EOS>
A
short
while
ago
I
was
downcast
as
you
,
melancholy
as
an
owl
,
and
timorous
as
a
kid
,
but
now
I
am
resolute
as
an
eagle
,
stout
of
heart
,
and
cheerful
of
spirit
;
and
all
owing
to
a
cup
of
wine
.
<EOS>
Try
the
remedy
,
Dick
,
and
get
rid
of
your
gloom
.
<EOS>
You
look
like
a
death's
-
head
at
a
festival
.
<EOS>
What
if
you
have
stumbled
on
an
ill
-
omened
grave
!
<EOS>
What
if
you
have
been
banned
by
a
witch
!
<EOS>
What
if
you
have
stood
face
to
face
with
the
devil
--
or
a
ghost
!
<EOS>
Heed
them
not
!
<EOS>
Drink
,
and
set
care
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
And
,
not
to
gainsay
my
own
counsel
,
I
shall
fill
my
cup
again
.
<EOS>
For
,
in
good
sooth
,
this
is
rare
clary
,
Dick
;
and
,
talking
of
wine
,
you
should
taste
some
of
the
wonderful
Rhenish
found
in
the
abbot
's
cellar
by
our
ancestor
,
Richard
Assheton
--
a
century
old
if
it
be
a
day
,
and
yet
cordial
and
corroborative
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Those
monks
were
lusty
tipplers
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
wish
I
had
been
an
abbot
myself
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
made
a
rare
father
confessor
--
especially
to
a
pretty
penitent
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Gregory
,
hie
thee
to
the
master
cellarer
,
and
bid
him
fill
me
a
goblet
of
the
old
Rhenish
--
the
wine
from
the
abbot
's
cellar
.
<EOS>
Thou
understandest
--
or
,
stay
,
better
bring
the
flask
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
profound
respect
for
the
venerable
bottle
,
and
would
pay
my
devoirs
to
it
.
<EOS>
Hie
away
,
good
fellow
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
drink
too
much
if
you
go
on
thus
,
"
remarked
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
drop
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
blithe
as
a
lark
,
and
would
keep
so
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
I
drink
.
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
our
ghosts
.
<EOS>
Since
this
place
must
be
haunted
,
I
would
it
were
visited
by
spirits
of
a
livelier
kind
than
old
Paslew
.
<EOS>
There
is
Isole
de
Heton
,
for
instance
.
<EOS>
The
fair
votaress
would
be
the
sort
of
ghost
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
turn
my
back
on
her
,
but
face
her
manfully
.
<EOS>
Look
at
her
picture
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
Was
ever
countenance
sweeter
than
hers
--
lips
more
tempting
,
or
eyes
more
melting
!
<EOS>
Is
she
not
adorable
?
<EOS>
Zounds
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
suddenly
pausing
,
and
staring
at
the
portrait--"Would
<EOS>
you
believe
it
,
Dick
?
<EOS>
The
fair
Isole
winked
at
me
--
I'll
swear
she
did
.
<EOS>
I
mean
--
I
will
venture
to
affirm
upon
oath
,
if
required
,
that
she
winked
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
The
fumes
of
the
wine
have
mounted
to
your
brain
,
and
disordered
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
such
thing
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
regarding
the
picture
as
steadily
as
he
could--"she
's
leering
at
me
now
.
<EOS>
By
the
Queen
of
Paphos
!
<EOS>
another
wink
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
you
doubt
me
,
watch
her
well
yourself
.
<EOS>
A
pleasant
adventure
this
--
ha!--ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
truce
to
this
drunken
foolery
,
"
cried
Richard
,
moving
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Drunken
!
s'death
!
<EOS>
recall
that
epithet
,
Dick
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
more
drunk
than
yourself
,
you
dog
.
<EOS>
I
can
walk
as
steadily
,
and
see
as
plainly
,
as
you
;
and
I
will
maintain
it
at
the
point
of
the
sword
,
that
the
eyes
of
that
picture
have
lovingly
regarded
me
;
nay
,
that
they
follow
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
common
delusion
with
a
portrait
,
"
said
Richard
;
"
they
appear
to
follow
_
me
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
they
do
not
wink
at
you
as
they
do
at
me
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
"
neither
do
the
lips
break
into
smiles
,
and
display
the
pearly
teeth
beneath
them
,
as
occurs
in
my
case
.
<EOS>
Grim
old
abbots
frown
on
you
,
but
fair
,
though
frail
,
votaresses
smile
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
favoured
mortal
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Were
it
as
you
represent
,
Nicholas
,
"
replied
Richard
,
gravely
,
"
I
should
say
,
indeed
,
that
some
evil
principle
was
at
work
to
lure
you
through
your
passions
to
perdition
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
they
are
all
fancies
engendered
by
your
heated
brain
,
which
in
your
calmer
moments
you
will
discard
,
as
I
discard
them
now
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
any
weight
with
you
,
I
counsel
you
to
drink
no
more
,
or
you
will
commit
some
mad
foolery
,
of
which
you
will
be
ashamed
hereafter
.
<EOS>
The
discreeter
course
would
be
to
retire
altogether
;
and
for
this
you
have
ample
excuse
,
as
you
will
have
to
arise
betimes
to
-
morrow
,
to
set
out
for
Pendle
Forest
with
Master
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Retire
!
"
exclaimed
Nicholas
,
bursting
into
a
loud
,
contemptuous
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
thy
counsel
,
lad
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
will
retire
when
I
have
finished
the
old
monastic
Rhenish
which
Gregory
is
bringing
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
retire
when
I
have
danced
the
Morisco
with
the
May
Queen
--
the
Cushion
Dance
with
Dame
Tetlow
--
and
the
Brawl
with
the
lovely
Isole
de
Heton
.
<EOS>
Another
wink
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
By
our
Lady
!
<EOS>
she
assents
to
my
proposition
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
done
all
this
,
and
somewhat
more
,
it
will
be
time
to
think
of
retiring
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
the
night
before
me
,
Dick
--
not
to
be
spent
in
drowsy
unconsciousness
,
as
thou
recommendest
,
but
in
active
,
pleasurable
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
No
man
requires
less
sleep
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
Ordinarily
,
I
'
retire
,
'
as
thou
termest
it
,
at
ten
,
and
rise
with
the
sun
.
<EOS>
In
summer
I
am
abroad
soon
after
three
,
and
mend
that
if
thou
canst
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
I
shall
seek
my
couch
about
midnight
,
and
yet
I
'll
warrant
me
<EOS>
I
shall
be
the
first
stirring
in
the
Abbey
;
and
,
in
any
case
,
I
shall
be
in
the
saddle
before
thee
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
"
replied
Richard
;
"
but
it
was
to
preserve
you
from
extravagance
to
-
night
that
I
volunteered
advice
,
which
,
from
my
knowledge
of
your
character
,
I
might
as
well
have
withheld
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
caution
you
on
another
point
.
<EOS>
Dance
with
Dame
Tetlow
,
or
any
other
dame
you
please
<EOS>
--
dance
with
the
fair
Isole
de
Heton
,
if
you
can
prevail
upon
her
to
descend
from
her
frame
and
give
you
her
hand
;
but
I
object
--
<EOS>
most
decidedly
object
--
to
your
dancing
with
Alizon
Device
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
so
?
"
cried
Nicholas
;
"
why
should
I
not
dance
with
whom
I
please
?
<EOS>
And
what
right
<EOS>
hast
thou
to
forbid
me
Alizon
?
<EOS>
Troth
,
lad
,
art
thou
<EOS>
so
ignorant
of
human
nature
as
not
to
know
that
forbidden
fruit
is
the
sweetest
.
<EOS>
It
hath
ever
been
so
since
the
fall
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
only
the
more
bent
upon
dancing
with
the
prohibited
damsel
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
fain
know
the
principle
on
which
thou
erectest
thyself
into
her
guardian
.
<EOS>
Is
it
because
she
fainted
when
thy
sword
was
crossed
with
that
hot
-
headed
fool
,
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
,
that
thou
flatterest
thyself
<EOS>
she
is
in
love
with
thee
?
<EOS>
Be
not
too
sure
of
it
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
Many
a
timid
wench
has
swooned
at
the
sight
of
a
naked
weapon
,
without
being
enamoured
of
the
swordsman
.
<EOS>
The
fainting
proves
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
grant
she
loves
thee
--
<EOS>
what
then
!
<EOS>
An
end
must
speedily
come
of
it
;
so
better
finish
at
once
,
before
she
be
entangled
in
a
mesh
from
which
she
can
not
be
extricated
without
danger
.
<EOS>
For
hark
thee
,
Dick
,
whatever
thou
mayst
think
,
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
far
gone
that
I
know
not
what
I
say
,
<EOS>
neither
is
my
vision
so
much
obscured
that
I
see
not
some
matters
plainly
enough
,
and
I
understand
thee
and
Alizon
well
,
and
see
through
you
both
.
<EOS>
This
matter
must
go
no
further
.
<EOS>
It
has
gone
too
far
already
.
<EOS>
After
to
-
night
you
must
see
her
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
am
serious
in
this
--
serious
_
inter
pocula
<EOS>
_
,
if
such
a
thing
can
be
.
<EOS>
It
is
necessary
to
observe
caution
,
for
reasons
that
will
at
once
occur
to
thee
.
<EOS>
Thou
canst
not
we
d
this
girl
--
then
why
trifle
with
her
till
her
heart
be
broken
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Broken
it
shall
never
be
by
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
you
it
will
be
broken
,
if
you
do
not
desist
at
once
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
but
jesting
when
I
said
I
would
rob
you
of
her
in
the
Morisco
,
though
it
would
be
charity
to
both
,
and
spare
you
many
a
pang
hereafter
,
were
I
to
put
my
threat
into
execution
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
have
a
soft
heart
where
aught
of
love
is
concerned
,
and
,
having
pointed
out
the
risk
you
will
incur
,
I
shall
leave
you
to
follow
your
own
devices
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
Alizon
's
sake
,
stop
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
now
speak
soberly
and
sensibly
enough
,
Nicholas
,
"
replied
Richard
,
"
and
I
thank
you
heartily
for
your
counsel
;
and
if
I
do
not
follow
it
by
withdrawing
at
once
from
a
pursuit
which
may
appear
to
you
hopeless
,
if
not
dangerous
,
you
will
,
I
hope
,
give
me
credit
for
being
actuated
by
worthy
motives
.
<EOS>
I
will
at
once
,
and
frankly
admit
,
that
I
love
Alizon
;
and
loving
her
,
you
may
rest
assured
I
would
sacrifice
my
life
a
thousand
times
rather
than
endanger
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
point
in
her
history
,
with
which
if
you
were
acquainted
,
it
might
alter
your
view
of
the
case
;
but
this
is
not
the
season
for
its
disclosure
,
neither
,
I
am
bound
to
say
,
does
the
circumstance
so
materially
alter
the
apparent
posture
of
affairs
as
to
remove
all
difficulty
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
leaves
an
insurmountable
obstacle
behind
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
wise
,
then
,
in
going
on
?
"
asked
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
answered
Richard
,
"
but
I
feel
as
if
I
were
the
sport
of
fate
.
<EOS>
Uncertain
whither
to
turn
for
the
best
,
I
leave
the
disposition
of
my
course
to
chance
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
sadly
,
"
all
seems
to
point
out
that
this
meeting
with
Alizon
will
be
my
last
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
cheer
up
,
lad
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
These
afflictions
are
hard
to
bear
,
it
is
true
;
but
somehow
they
are
got
over
.
<EOS>
Just
as
if
your
horse
should
fling
you
in
the
midst
of
a
hedge
when
you
are
making
a
flying
leap
,
you
get
scratched
and
bruised
,
but
you
scramble
out
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
are
on
your
legs
again
.
<EOS>
Love
breaks
no
bones
,
that
's
one
comfort
.
<EOS>
When
at
your
age
,
I
was
desperately
in
love
,
not
with
Mistress
Nicholas
Assheton
--
<EOS>
Heaven
help
the
fond
soul
!
<EOS>
but
with
--
never
mind
with
whom
;
but
it
was
not
a
very
prudent
match
,
and
so
,
in
my
worldly
wisdom
,
I
was
obliged
to
cry
off
.
<EOS>
A
sad
business
it
was
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
have
died
of
it
,
and
I
made
quite
sure
that
the
devoted
girl
would
die
first
,
in
which
case
we
were
to
occupy
the
same
grave
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
not
driven
to
such
a
dire
extremity
,
for
before
I
had
kept
house
a
week
,
Jack
Walker
,
the
keeper
of
Downham
,
made
his
appearance
in
my
room
,
and
after
telling
me
of
the
mischief
done
by
a
pair
of
otters
in
the
Ribble
,
finding
me
in
a
very
desponding
state
,
ventured
to
inquire
if
I
had
heard
the
news
.
<EOS>
Expecting
to
hear
of
the
death
of
the
girl
,
I
prepared
myself
for
an
outburst
of
grief
,
and
resolved
to
give
immediate
directions
for
a
double
funeral
,
when
he
informed
me
--
what
do
you
think
,
Dick?--that
<EOS>
she
was
going
to
be
married
to
himself
.
<EOS>
I
recovered
at
once
,
and
immediately
went
out
to
hunt
the
otters
,
and
rare
sport
we
had
.
<EOS>
But
here
comes
Gregory
with
the
famous
old
Rhenish
.
<EOS>
Better
take
a
cup
,
Dick
;
this
is
the
best
cure
for
the
heartache
,
and
for
all
other
aches
and
grievances
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
glorious
stuff
--
miraculous
wine
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
smacking
his
lips
with
extraordinary
satisfaction
after
a
deep
draught
;
"
those
worthy
fathers
were
excellent
judges
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
reverence
for
them
.
<EOS>
But
where
can
Alizon
be
all
this
while
?
<EOS>
Supper
is
wellnigh
over
,
and
the
dancing
and
pastimes
will
commence
anon
,
and
yet
she
comes
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
here
,
"
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
Mistress
Nutter
and
Alizon
entered
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
endeavoured
to
read
in
the
young
girl
's
countenance
some
intimation
of
what
had
passed
between
her
and
Mistress
Nutter
,
but
he
only
remarked
that
she
was
paler
than
before
,
and
had
traces
of
anxiety
about
her
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
also
looked
gloomy
and
thoughtful
,
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
manner
or
deportment
of
either
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
,
that
a
discovery
of
relationship
between
them
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
As
Alizon
moved
on
,
her
eyes
met
those
of
Richard
--
but
the
look
was
intercepted
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
instantly
called
off
her
daughter
's
attention
to
herself
;
and
,
while
the
young
man
hesitated
to
join
them
,
his
sister
came
quickly
up
to
him
,
and
drew
him
away
in
another
direction
.
<EOS>
Left
to
himself
,
Nicholas
tossed
off
another
cup
of
the
miraculous
Rhenish
,
which
improved
in
flavour
as
he
discussed
it
,
and
then
,
placing
a
chair
opposite
the
portrait
of
Isole
de
Heton
,
filled
a
bumper
,
and
,
uttering
the
name
of
the
fair
votaress
,
drained
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
This
time
he
was
quite
certain
he
received
a
significant
glance
in
return
,
and
no
one
being
near
to
contradict
him
,
he
went
on
indulging
the
idea
of
an
amorous
understanding
between
himself
and
the
picture
,
till
he
had
finished
the
bottle
,
and
obtained
as
many
ogles
as
he
swallowed
draughts
of
wine
,
upon
which
he
arose
and
staggered
off
in
search
of
Dame
Tetlow
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mistress
Nutter
having
made
her
excuses
to
Lady
Assheton
for
not
attending
the
supper
,
walked
down
the
hall
with
her
daughter
,
until
such
time
as
the
dancing
and
pastimes
should
commence
.
<EOS>
As
will
be
readily
supposed
under
the
circumstances
,
this
part
of
the
entertainment
was
distasteful
to
both
of
them
;
but
it
could
not
be
avoided
without
entering
into
explanations
,
which
Mistress
Nutter
was
unwilling
to
make
,
and
she
,
therefore
,
counselled
her
daughter
to
act
in
all
respects
as
if
she
were
still
Alizon
Device
,
and
in
no
way
connected
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
an
early
opportunity
of
announcing
my
intention
to
adopt
you
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
then
you
can
act
differently
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
keep
near
me
as
much
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
Say
little
to
Dorothy
or
Richard
Assheton
,
and
prepare
to
retire
early
;
for
this
noisy
and
riotous
assemblage
is
not
much
to
my
taste
,
and
I
care
not
how
soon
I
quit
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
assented
to
what
was
said
,
and
stole
a
timid
glance
towards
Richard
and
Dorothy
;
but
the
latter
,
who
alone
perceived
it
,
instantly
averted
her
head
,
in
such
way
as
to
make
it
evident
she
wished
to
shun
her
regards
.
<EOS>
Slight
as
it
was
,
this
circumstance
occasioned
Alizon
much
pain
,
for
she
could
not
conceive
how
she
had
offended
her
new
-
made
friend
,
and
it
was
some
relief
to
encounter
a
party
of
acquaintances
who
had
risen
from
the
lower
table
at
her
approach
,
though
they
did
not
presume
to
address
her
while
she
was
with
Mistress
Nutter
,
but
waited
respectfully
at
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
Alizon
,
however
,
flew
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Susan!--ah
,
Nancy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
taking
the
hand
of
each--"how
glad
I

<EOS>
"

replied
Alizon
,
blushing
;
"
and
in

<EOS>
"
And

"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Mistress
Nutter
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
friends
,
"
she
said
,
"
as
you
appear
to
take
so
much
interest
in
Alizon
,
you
may
be
glad
to
learn
that
it
is
my
intention
to
adopt
her
as
a
daughter
,
having
no
child
of
my
own
;
and
,
though
her
position
henceforth
will
be
very
different
from
what
it
has
been
,
I
am
sure
she
will
never
forget
her
old
friends
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
indeed
,
never
!
"
cried
Alizon
,
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
good
news
,
indeed
,
"
cried
Sampson
Harrop
,
joyfully
,
while
the
others
joined
in
his
exclamation
.
<EOS>
"
We
all
rejoice
in
Alizon
's
good
fortune
,
and
think
she
richly
deserves
it
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
was
always
sure
she
would
have
rare
luck
,
but
I
did
not
expect
such
luck
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
become
o
'
me
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Jennet
,
coming
from
behind
a
chair
,
<EOS>
where
she
had
hitherto
concealed
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
always
take
care
of
you
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
stooping
,
and
kissing
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
promise
more
than
you
may
be
able
to
perform
,
Alizon
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
,
coldly
,
and
regarding
the
little
girl
with
a
look
of
disgust
;
"
an
ill
-
favour'd
little
creature
,
with
the
Demdike
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
as
ill
-
tempered
as
she
is
ill
-
favoured
,
"
rejoined
Sampson
Harrop
;
"
and
,
though
she
can
not
help
being
ugly
,
she
might
help
being
malicious
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jennet
gave
him
a
bitter
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
her
injustice
,
Master
Harrop
,
"
said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Poor
little
Jennet
is
quick
-
tempered
,
but
not
malevolent
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

Jennet
,

"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is

of

"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

rejoined
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
If

"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing

she
could
do
would
surprise
me
,
"
remarked
Harrop
.
"
<EOS>
But

<EOS>
"
Ey

replied
the
little

<EOS>
"
Mother

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
do
<EOS>

know

"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
and
,
from
my
experience
of
her
temper
in
former
days
,
I
should
be
loath
to
have
you

who

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Peace

cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
losing
all
patience
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall

take

away
?
"
said
Harrop
--
seizing
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay

"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
No

"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
,
quickly
<EOS>
;
"
I
shall
be
miserable
if
she
goes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,

quite

said
Jennet
,
"

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
want

Jennet
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Onny
to
tell
him

gone

"
replied
the
little
girl
,
with
a
significant
and
malicious
look
at
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
muttered
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
more
malice
in
this
little
wasp
than
I
thought
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
rob
it
of
its
sting
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
while
thus
communing
with
herself
,
she
fixed
a
searching
look
on
Jennet
,
and
then
raising
her
hand
quickly
,
waved
it
in
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
the
little
girl
,
falling
suddenly
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Alizon
,
flying
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
dunna
reetly
knoa
,
"
replied
Jennet
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
seized
with
a
sudden
faintness
,
"
said
Harrop
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Better
she
should
go
home
then
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
'll
find
somebody
to
take
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw

said
Jennet
;
"
ey

soon

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
Alizon
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
apparently
unconcerned
at
the
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
Having
confided
the
little
girl
,
who
was
now
recovered
from
the
shock
,
to
the
care
of
Nancy
Holt
,
Alizon
followed
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Sir
Ralph
,
who
had
quitted
the
supper
-
table
,
clapped
his
hands
loudly
,
thus
giving
the
signal
to
the
minstrels
,
who
,
having
repaired
to
the
gallery
,
now
struck
up
a
merry
tune
,
and
instantly
the
whole
hall
was
in
motion
.
<EOS>
Snatching
up
his
wand
Sampson
Harrop
hurried
after
Alizon
,
beseeching
her
to
return
with
him
,
and
join
a
procession
about
to
be
formed
by
the
revellers
,
and
of
course
,
as
May
Queen
,
and
the
most
important
personage
in
it
,
she
could
not
refuse
.
<EOS>
Very
short
space
sufficed
the
morris
-
dancers
to
find
their
partners
;
Robin
Hood
and
the
foresters
got
into
their
places
;
the
hobby
-
horse
curveted
and
capered
;
Friar
Tuck
resumed
his
drolleries
;
and
even
Jack
Roby
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
get
on
his
legs
,
though
he
could
not
walk
very
steadily
.
<EOS>
Marshalled
by
the
gentleman
-
usher
,
and
headed
by
Robin
Hood
and
the
May
Queen
,
the
procession
marched
round
the
hall
,
the
minstrels
playing
merrily
the
while
,
and
then
drew
up
before
the
upper
table
,
where
a
brief
oration
was
pronounced
by
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
A
shout
that
made
the
rafters
ring
again
followed
the
address
,
after
which
a
couranto
was
called
for
by
the
host
,
who
,
taking
Mistress
Nicholas
Assheton
by
the
hand
,
led
her
into
the
body
of
the
hall
,
whither
he
was
speedily
followed
by
the
other
guests
,
who
had
found
partners
in
like
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Before
relating
how
the
ball
was
opened
a
word
must
be
bestowed
upon
Mistress
Nicholas
Assheton
,
whom
I
have
neglected
nearly
as
much
as
she
was
neglected
by
her
unworthy
spouse
,
and
I
therefore
hasten
to
repair
the
injustice
by
declaring
that
she
was
a
very
amiable
and
very
charming
woman
,
and
danced
delightfully
.
<EOS>
And
recollect
,
ladies
,
these
were
dancing
days
--
<EOS>
I
mean
days
when
knowledge
of
figures
as
well
as
skill
was
required
,
more
than
twenty
forgotten
dances
being
in
vogue
,
the
very
names
of
which
may
surprise
you
as
I
recapitulate
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
Passamezzo
,
a
great
favourite
with
Queen
Elizabeth
,
who
used
to
foot
it
merrily
,
when
,
as
you
are
told
by
Gray--
           
"
The
great
Lord
-
keeper
led
the
brawls
,
          
And
seals
and
maces
danced
before
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
grave
Pavane
,
likewise
a
favourite
with
the
Virgin
Queen
,
and
which
I
should
like
to
see
supersede
the
eternal
polka
at
Almack
's
and
elsewhere
,
and
in
which--
           
<EOS>
"
Five
was
the
number
of
the
music
's
feet
          
<EOS>
Which
still
the
dance
did
with
live
paces
meet
;
"
 
the
Couranto
,
with
its
"
current
traverses
,
"
"
sliding
passages
,
"
and
solemn
tune
,
wherein
,
according
to
Sir
John
Davies--
           
--"that
dancer
greatest
praise
hath
won
          
<EOS>
Who
with
best
order
can
all
order
shun
;
"
 
the
Lavolta
,
also
delineated
by
the
same
knowing
hand--
           
<EOS>
"
Where
arm
in
arm
two
dancers
are
entwined
,
          
And
whirl
themselves
with
strict
embracements
bound
,
          
their
feet
an
anapest
do
sound
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Is
not
this
very
much
like
a
waltz
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
ladies
,
you
have
been
dancing
the
lavolta
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
without
being
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
another
waltz
still
older
,
called
the
Sauteuse
,
which
I
suspect
answered
to
your
favourite
polka
.
<EOS>
Then
there
were
brawls
,
galliards
,
paspys
,
sarabands
,
country
-
dances
of
various
figures
,
cushion
dances
(
<EOS>
another
dance
I
long
to
see
revived
)
,
kissing
dances
,
and
rounds
,
any
of
which
are
better
than
the
objectionable
polka
.
<EOS>
Thus
you
will
see
that
there
was
infinite
variety
at
least
at
the
period
under
consideration
,
and
that
you
have
rather
retrograded
than
advanced
in
the
saltatory
art
.
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nicholas
Assheton
<EOS>
,
I
have
said
,
excelled
in
the
graceful
accomplishment
of
dancing
,
and
that
was
probably
the
reason
why
she
had
been
selected
for
the
couranto
by
Sir
Ralph
,
who
knew
the
value
of
a
good
partner
.
<EOS>
By
many
persons
she
was
accounted
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
room
,
and
in
dignity
of
carriage
she
was
certainly
unrivalled
.
<EOS>
This
was
precisely
what
Sir
Ralph
required
,
and
having
executed
a
few
"
current
traverses
and
sliding
passages
"
with
her
,
with
a
gravity
and
stateliness
worthy
of
Sir
Christopher
Hatton
himself
,
when
graced
by
the
hand
of
his
sovereign
mistress
,
he
conducted
her
,
amid
the
hushed
admiration
of
the
beholders
,
to
a
seat
.
<EOS>
Still
the
dance
continued
with
unabated
spirit
;
all
those
engaged
in
it
running
up
and
down
,
or
"
turning
and
winding
with
unlooked
-
for
change
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alizon
's
hand
had
been
claimed
by
Richard
Assheton
,
and
next
to
the
stately
host
and
his
dignified
partner
,
they
came
in
for
the
largest
share
of
admiration
and
attention
;
and
if
the
untutored
girl
fell
short
of
the
accomplished
dame
in
precision
and
skill
,
she
made
up
for
the
want
of
them
in
natural
grace
and
freedom
of
movement
,
for
the
display
of
which
the
couranto
,
with
its
frequent
and
impromptu
changes
,
afforded
ample
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Even
Sir
Ralph
was
struck
with
her
extreme
gracefulness
,
and
pointed
her
out
to
Mistress
Nicholas
,
who
,
unenvying
and
amiable
,
joined
heartily
in
his
praises
.
<EOS>
Overhearing
what
was
said
,
Mrs.
Nutter
thought
it
a
fitting
opportunity
to
announce
her
intention
of
adopting
the
young
girl
;
and
though
Sir
Ralph
seemed
a
good
deal
surprised
at
the
suddenness
of
the
declaration
,
he
raised
no
objection
to
the
plan
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
applauded
it
.
<EOS>
But
another
person
,
by
no
means
disposed
to
regard
it
in
an
equally
favourable
light
became
acquainted
with
the
intelligence
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
This
was
Master
Potts
,
who
instantly
set
his
wits
at
work
to
discover
its
import
.
<EOS>
Ever
on
the
alert
,
his
little
eyes
,
sharp
as
needles
,
had
detected
Jennet
amongst
the
rustic
company
,
and
he
now
made
his
way
towards
her
,
resolved
,
by
dint
of
cross
-
questioning
and
otherwise
,
to
extract
all
the
information
he
possibly
could
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
dance
over
,
Richard
and
his
partner
wandered
towards
a
more
retired
part
of
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
does
your
sister
shun
me
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Alizon
,
with
a
look
of
great
distress
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
have
done
to
offend
her
?
<EOS>
Whenever
I
regard
her
she
averts
her
head
,
and
as
I
approached
her
just
now
,
she
moved
away
,
making
it
evident
she
designed
to
avoid
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
think
myself
in
any
way
different
from
what
I
was
this
morning
,
when
she
treated
me
with
such
unbounded
confidence
and
kindness
,
or
accuse
myself
of
any
offence
towards
her
,
even
in
thought
,
I
could
understand
it
;
but
as
it
is
,
her
present
coldness
appears
inexplicable
and
unreasonable
,
and
gives
me
great
pain
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
forfeit
her
regard
for
worlds
,
and
therefore
beseech
you
to
tell
me
what
I
have
done
amiss
,
that
I
may
endeavour
to
repair
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
nothing
--
nothing
whatever
,
sweet
girl
,
"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
caprice
on
Dorothy
's
part
,
and
except
that
it
distresses
you
,
her
conduct
,
which
you
justly
call
'
unreasonable
,
'
does
not
deserve
a
moment
's
serious
consideration
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
deceive
me
thus
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
too
kind
--
too
well
-
judging
,
to
be
capricious
.
<EOS>
Something
must
have
occurred
to
make
her
change
her
opinion
of
me
,
though
what
it
is
<EOS>
I
can
not
conjecture
.
<EOS>
I
have
gained
much
to
-
day
--
more
than
I
had
any
right
to
expect
;
but
if
I
have
forfeited
the
good
opinion
of
your
sister
,
the
loss
of
her
friendship
will
counterbalance
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
not
lost
it
,
Alizon
,
"
replied
Richard
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dorothy
has
got
some
strange
notions
into
her
head
,
which
only
require
to
be
combated
.
<EOS>
She
does
not
like
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
is
piqued
and
displeased
by
the
extraordinary
interest
which
that
lady
displays
towards
you
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
she
not
like
Mistress
Nutter
?
"
inquired
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
there
is
no
accounting
for
fancies
,
"
returned
Richard
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
attempt
to
defend
her
,
but
simply
offer
the
only
excuse
in
my
power
for
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
concerned
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Alizon
,
sadly
,
"
because
henceforth
I
shall
be
so
intimately
connected
with
Mistress
Nutter
,
that
this
estrangement
,
which
I
hoped
arose
only
from
some
trivial
cause
,
and
merely
required
a
little
explanation
to
be
set
aside
,
may
become
widened
and
lasting
.
<EOS>
Owing
every
thing
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
I
must
espouse
her
cause
;
and
if
your
sister
likes
her
not
,
she
likes
me
not
in
consequence
,
and
therefore
we
must
continue
divided
.
<EOS>
But
surely
her
dislike
is
of
very
recent
date
,
and
can
not
have
any
strong
hold
upon
her
;
for
when
she
and
Mistress
Nutter
met
this
morning
,
a
very
different
feeling
seemed
to
animate
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
indeed
,
it
did
,
"
replied
Richard
,
visibly
embarrassed
and
distressed
.
"
<EOS>
And
since
you
have
made
me
acquainted
with
the
new
tie
and
interests
you
have
formed
,
I
can
only
regret
alluding
to
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
may
not
misunderstand
me
,
"
said
Alizon
,
"
I
will
explain
the
extent
of
my
obligations
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
then
you
will
perceive
how
much
I
am
bounden
to
her
.
<EOS>
Childless
herself
,
greatly
interested
in
me
,
and
feeling
for
my
unfortunate
situation
,
with
infinite
goodness
of
heart
<EOS>
she
has
declared
her
intention
of
removing
me
from
all
chance
of
baneful
influence
,
from
the
family
with
whom
I
have
been
heretofore
connected
,
by
adopting
me
as
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
indeed
rejoice
at
this
,
"
said
Richard
,
"
were
it
not
that--
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
stopped
,
gazing
anxiously
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
not
what
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
,
alarmed
by
his
looks
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
press
me
further
,
"
he
rejoined
;
"
I
can
not
answer
you
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
have
said
too
much
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
too
much
or
too
little
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
I
implore
you
.
<EOS>
What
mean
these
dark
hints
which
you
throw
out
,
and
which
like
shadows
elude
all
attempts
to
grasp
them
!
<EOS>
Do
not
keep
me
in
this
state
of
suspense
and
agitation
.
<EOS>
Your
looks
speak
more
than
your
words
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
give
your
thoughts
utterance
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
what
I
have
heard
,
and
therefore
will
not
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
only
increase
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
But
oh
!
tell
me
this
!
<EOS>
Was
it
,
indeed
,
to
remove
you
from
the
baneful
influence
of
Elizabeth
Device
that
Mistress
Nutter
adopted
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Other
motives
may
have
swayed
her
,
and
I
have
said
they
did
so
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Alizon
;
"
but
that
wish
,
no
doubt
,
had
great
weight
with
her
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
notwithstanding
her
abhorrence
of
the
family
,
she
has
kindly
consented
to
use
her
best
endeavours
to
preserve
little
Jennet
from
further
ill
,
as
well
as
to
reclaim
poor
misguided
Elizabeth
herself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
weight
you
have
taken
from
my
heart
,
"
cried
Richard
,
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
Dorothy
what
you
say
,
and
it
will
at
once
remove
all
her
doubts
and
suspicions
.
<EOS>
She
will
now
be
the
same
to
you
as
ever
,
and
to
Mistress
Nutter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
ask
you
what
those
doubts
and
suspicions
were
,
since
you
so
confidently
promise
me
this
,
which
is
all
I
desire
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
smiling
;
"
but
any
unfavourable
opinions
entertained
of
Mistress
Nutter
are
wholly
undeserved
.
<EOS>
Poor
lady
!
<EOS>
she
has
endured
many
severe
trials
and
sufferings
,
and
whenever
you
learn
the
whole
of
her
history
,
she
will
,
I
am
sure
,
have
your
sincere
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
certainly
produced
a
complete
revolution
in
my
feelings
towards
her
,
"
said
Richard
,
"
and
I
shall
not
be
easy
till
I
have
made
a
like
convert
of
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
loud
clapping
of
hands
was
heard
,
and
Nicholas
was
seen
marching
towards
the
centre
of
the
hall
,
preceded
by
the
minstrels
,
who
had
descended
for
the
purpose
from
the
gallery
,
and
bearing
in
his
arms
a
large
red
velvet
cushion
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
dancers
had
formed
a
wide
circle
round
him
,
a
very
lively
tune
called
"
Joan
Sanderson
,
"
from
which
the
dance
about
to
be
executed
sometimes
received
its
name
,
was
struck
up
,
and
the
squire
,
after
a
few
preliminary
flourishes
,
set
down
the
cushion
,
and
gave
chase
to
Dame
Tetlow
,
who
,
threading
her
way
rapidly
through
the
ring
,
contrived
to
elude
him
.
<EOS>
This
chase
,
accompanied
by
music
,
excited
shouts
of
laughter
on
all
hands
,
and
no
one
knew
which
most
to
admire
,
the
eagerness
of
the
squire
,
or
the
dexterity
of
the
lissom
dame
in
avoiding
him
.
 
<EOS>
Exhausted
at
length
,
and
baffled
in
his
quest
<EOS>
,
Nicholas
came
to
a
halt
before
Tom
the
Piper
,
and
,
taking
up
the
cushion
,
thus
preferred
his
complaint:--"This
dance
it
can
no
further
go
--
no
further
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
piper
chanted
in
reply,--"I
pray
you
,
good
sir
<EOS>
,
why
say
you
so
--
why
say
you
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
Amidst
general
laughter
,
the
squire
tenderly
and
touchingly
<EOS>
responded--"Because
<EOS>
Dame
Tetlow
will
not
come
to
--
will
not
come
to
.
"
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
Tom
the
Piper
,
waxing
furious
,
blew
a
shrill
whistle
,
accompanied
by
an
encouraging
rattle
of
the
tambarine
,
and
enforcing
the
mandate
by
two
or
three
energetic
stamps
on
the
floor
,
delivered
himself
in
this
fashion:--"She
<EOS>
_
must

And

"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
two
of
the
prettiest
female
morris
-
dancers
,
taking
each
a
hand
of
the
blushing
and
overheated
Dame
Tetlow
,
for
she
had
found
the
chase
rather
warm
work
,
led
her
forward
;
while
the
squire
advancing
very
gallantly
placed
the
cushion
upon
the
ground
before
her
,
and
as
she
knelt
down
upon
it
,
bestowed
a
smacking
kiss
upon
her
lips
.
<EOS>
This
ceremony
being
performed
amidst
much
tittering
and
flustering
,
accompanied
by
many
knowing
looks
and
some
expressed
wishes
among
the
swains
,
who
hoped
that
their
turn
might
come
next
,
Dame
Tetlow
arose
,
and
the
squire
seizing
her
hand
,
they
began
to
whisk
round
in
a
sort
of
jig
,
singing
merrily
as
they
danced--
           
<EOS>
"
Prinkum
prankum
is
a
fine
dance
,
          
<EOS>
And
we
shall
go
dance
it
once
again
!
                                   
<EOS>
Once
again
,
          
And
we
shall
go
dance
it
once
again
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
they
made
good
the
words
too
;
for
on
coming
to
a
stop
,
Dame
Tetlow
snatched
up
the
cushion
,
and
ran
in
search
of
the
squire
,
who
retreating
among
the
surrounding
damsels
,
made
sad
havoc
among
them
,
scarcely
leaving
a
pretty
pair
of
lips
unvisited
.
<EOS>
Oh
Nicholas
!
<EOS>
Nicholas
!
<EOS>
I
am
thoroughly
ashamed
of
you
,
and
regret
becoming
your
historian
.
<EOS>
You
get
me
into
an
infinitude
of
scrapes
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
rod
in
pickle
for
you
,
sir
,
which
shall
be
used
with
good
effect
presently
.
<EOS>
Tired
of
such
an
unprofitable
quest
,
Dame
Tetlow
came
to
a
sudden
halt
,
addressed
the
piper
as
Nicholas
had
addressed
him
,
and
receiving
a
like
answer
,
summoned
the
delinquent
to
come
forward
;
but
as
he
knelt
down
on
the
cushion
,
instead
of
receiving
the
anticipated
salute
,
he
got
a
sound
box
on
the
ears
,
the
dame
,
actuated
probably
by
some
feeling
of
jealousy
,
taking
advantage
of
the
favourable
opportunity
afforded
her
of
avenging
herself
.
<EOS>
No
one
could
refrain
from
laughing
at
this
unexpected
turn
in
affairs
,
and
Nicholas
,
to
do
him
justice
,
took
it
in
excellent
part
,
and
laughed
louder
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Springing
to
his
feet
,
he
snatched
the
kiss
denied
him
by
the
spirited
dame
,
and
led
her
to
obtain
some
refreshment
at
the
lower
table
,
of
which
they
both
stood
in
need
,
while
the
cushion
being
appropriated
by
other
couples
,
other
boxes
on
the
ear
and
kisses
were
interchanged
,
leading
to
an
infinitude
of
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
Long
before
this
Master
Potts
had
found
his
way
to
Jennet
,
and
as
he
drew
near
,
affecting
to
notice
her
for
the
first
time
,
he
made
some
remarks
upon
her
not
looking
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
"

Your

<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
"
Your
comparison
is
not
very
flattering

Jennet
,
"
replied
Potts
;
"
but
I
pass
it
by
for
the
sake
of
its
cleverness

<EOS>
You
are
a
sharp

Jennet
--
a
very
sharp
child

<EOS>
I
remarked
that
from
the
first
moment
I
saw
you
.
<EOS>
But
in
regard
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
she
seems
a
very
nice
lady
--
and
must
be
a
very
kind
lady
,
since
she
has
made
up
her
mind
to
adopt
your

<EOS>
Not
that
I
am
surprised
at
her
determination

<EOS>
so

"
Me

<EOS>
"
Dunna

"
 
<EOS>
"
No

no

"
replied
Potts
,
"
on
the
contrary
,
there
's
a
very
great
likeness

you

<EOS>
I
saw
you

<EOS>
I
do

<EOS>

perhaps
you

<EOS>
Yes

you
are
the
sharpest

undoubtedly

Jennet

<EOS>
If
I
wished

unfortunately
I
'm
not

having
only
bachelor

chambers

it
should

you

<EOS>
But
I
can
put
you
in
a
way
of
making
your
fortune

Jennet
,
and
that
's
the
next
best

adopting
you

<EOS>
Indeed

Potts

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pay
particular
attention
to
what
I

it
over
carefully

when
you

by

<EOS>
You
are
quite
aware
that
there
is
a
great
talk
about
witches
in
these
parts
;
and
,
I
may
speak
it
without
offence
to
you
,
your

family

under
the
charge

<EOS>
There
is
your
grandmother
Demdike

for

a
notorious
witch

your

Dame

suspected

your

<EOS>
"

eyeing

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You

returned
Potts

<EOS>
"
It
would
not

if
every

be

shut
up

Alack

<EOS>
"
Listen
to

pursued
Potts
,
chuckling
,
"
and
I
will
point
out
to
you
a
way
of
escaping
the
general
fate
of
your

not
merely
of
escaping
it
--
<EOS>
but
of
acquiring
a
large
reward

<EOS>
And
that
is
by
giving
evidence

<EOS>
"
Yeigh

"
<EOS>
An

this

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
scheme

Jennet

"
said
Potts
,
"
and
a
notable
scheme
it
is

my
little
lass

<EOS>
Think
it
over

<EOS>
You
're
an
admissible
and
indeed
a
desirable
witness
;
for
our
sagacious
sovereign
has
expressly
observed
that
'
bairns
,
'
(
I
believe
you
call
children
'
bairns
'
in
Lancashire
,
Jennet
;
your
uncouth
dialect
very
much
resembles
the
Scottish
language
,
in
which
our
learned
monarch
writes
as
well
as
speaks)--'bairns
,
'
says
he
,
'
or
wives
,
or
never
so
defamed
persons
,
may
of
our
law
serve
for
sufficient
witnesses
and
proofs
;
for
who
but
witches
can
be
proofs
,
and
so
witnesses
of
the
doings
of
witches
.

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Boh

ey

neaw

<EOS>
ey

cried
Jennet
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
're
a
witch
's
bairn
,
my
little
lassy
,
"
replied
Potts
,
"
and
that
's
just
as
bad
,
and
you
'll
grow
up
to
be
a
witch
in
due
time
--
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
your
career
be
not
cut
short
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
must
have
witnessed
some
strange
things
when
you
visited
your
grandmother
at
Malkin
Tower
--
that
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
is
the
name
of
her
abode?--and
a
fearful
and
witch
-
like
name
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
is;--you
must
have
heard
frequent
mutterings
and
curses
,
spells
,
charms
,
and
diabolical
incantations
--
beheld
strange
and
monstrous
visions
--
listened
to
threats
uttered
against
people
who
have
afterwards
perished
unaccountably
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey've
heerd
an
seen
nowt
o't

"
replied
Jennet
;
"
boh
ey
'
<EOS>
han
heerd
my
mother
threaten
yo
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
indeed
,
"
cried
Potts
,
forcing
a
laugh
,
but
looking
rather
blank
afterwards
<EOS>
;
"
and
how
did
she
threaten
me
,
Jennet
,
<EOS>
eh?--But
no
matter
.
<EOS>
Let
that
pass
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
As
I
was
saying
,
you
must
have
seen
mysterious
proceedings
both
at
Malkin
Tower
and
your
own
house
.
<EOS>
A
black
gentleman
with
a
club
foot
must
visit
you
occasionally
,
and
your
mother
must
,
now
and
then
--
say
once
a
week
--
take
a
fancy
to
riding
on
a
broomstick
.
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
sure
you
have
never
ridden
on
one
yourself
,
Jennet
,
and
got
whisked
up
the
chimney
without
being
aware
of
it
?
<EOS>
It
's
the
common
witch
conveyance
,
and
said
to
be
very
expeditious
and
agreeable
--
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
vouch
for
it
myself
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Possibly
--
though
you
are
rather
young
--
but
possibly
,
I
say
,
you
may
have
attended
a
witch
's
Sabbath
,
and
seen
a
huge
He
-
Goat
,
with
four
horns
on
his
head
,
and
a
large
tail
,
seated
in
the
midst
of
a
large
circle
of
devoted
admirers
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
seen
this
,
and
can
recollect
the
names
and
faces
of
the
assembly
,
it
would
be
highly
important
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
ey
see
it
,
ey
shanna

"
replied
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
Boh
ey

Owd
Scrat
os

<EOS>
"
 
"
Has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
Alizon
might
be
addicted
to
these
practices
?
"
pursued
Potts
,
"
and
that
she
obtained
her
extraordinary
and
otherwise
unaccountable
beauty
by
some
magical
process
--
some
charm
--
some
diabolical
unguent
prepared
,
as
the
Lord
Keeper
of
the
Privy
Seals
,
the
singularly
learned
Lord
Bacon
,
declares
,
from
fat
of
unbaptised
babes

compounded
with
henbane
,
hemlock
,
mandrake
,
moonshade

and
other
terrible
ingredients

<EOS>
She
could
not

so
beautiful
without
some
such
aid

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
shows
how

Jennet

<EOS>
"

Alizon

<EOS>
"
Very
praiseworthy
,
indeed

my

replied
Potts
,
ironically
.
<EOS>
"
I
honour
you
for
your
sisterly
affection

,
notwithstanding
all
this

I

not

"
 
<EOS>
"
Licker
,
Mistress
Nutter
has
bewitched
her
,
"
replied
Jennet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you

Mistress
Nutter
is
a
witch
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Potts
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'st

rejoined
Jennet
,
doggedly

<EOS>
"
But

me

"
cried
Potts
,
"
I
have
my

nay

more
than

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
ye're

yo

said
Jennet
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
want

pursued
Potts
,
"
and
if
you
'll
serve
as
one--
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whot'll

"
said
Jennet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you

"
rejoined
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
name
the
sum
.
<EOS>
So
you
can
prove
the
practice
of
witchcraft
against
Mistress
Nutter
--
eh

"
 
<EOS>
Jennet
nodded
.
"
<EOS>
Wad

why
brother
Jem

gone
to
Pendle
to

<EOS>
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
much

indeed

"
replied
Potts
,
drawing
still
nearer
to
her
.
"
Very
much
,
indeed

"
 
The
little
girl
was
about
to
speak
,
but
on
a
sudden
a
sharp
convulsion
agitated
her
frame
;
her
utterance
totally
failed
her
;
and
she
fell
back
in
the
seat
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
Very
much
startled
,
Potts
flew
in
search
of
some
restorative
,
and
on
doing
so
,
he
perceived
Mistress
Nutter
moving
away
from
this
part
of
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
done
it
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
piece
of
witchcraft
before
my
very
eyes
.
<EOS>
Has
she
killed
the
child
?
<EOS>
No
;
she
breathes
,
and
her
pulse
beats
,
though
faintly
.
<EOS>
She
is
only
in
a
swoon
,
but
a
deep
and
deathlike
one
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
revive
her
;
she
must
come
to
in
her
own
way
,
or
at
the
pleasure
of
the
wicked
woman
who
has
thrown
her
into
this
condition
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
an
assured
witness
in
this
girl
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
keep
watch
upon
Mistress
Nutter
's
further
movements
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
walked
cautiously
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
Richard
had
anticipated
,
his
explanation
was
perfectly
satisfactory
to
Dorothy
;
and
the
young
lady
,
who
had
suffered
greatly
from
the
restraint
she
had
imposed
upon
herself
,
flew
to
Alizon
,
and
poured
forth
excuses
,
which
were
as
readily
accepted
as
they
were
freely
made
.
<EOS>
They
were
instantly
as
great
friends
as
before
,
and
their
brief
estrangement
only
seemed
to
make
them
dearer
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
could
not
forgive
herself
,
and
Alizon
assured
her
there
was
nothing
to
be
forgiven
,
and
so
they
took
hands
upon
it
,
and
promised
to
forget
all
that
had
passed
.
<EOS>
Richard
stood
by
,
delighted
with
the
change
,
and
wrapped
in
the
contemplation
of
the
object
of
his
love
,
who
,
thus
engaged
,
<EOS>
seemed
to
him
more
beautiful
than
he
had
ever
beheld
her
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
the
close
of
the
evening
,
while
all
three
were
still
together
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
came
up
and
took
Richard
aside
.
<EOS>
The
squire
looked
flushed
;
and
there
was
an
undefined
expression
of
alarm
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Richard
,
dreading
to
hear
of
some
new
calamity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
not
noticed
it
,
Dick
?
"
said
Nicholas
,
in
a
hollow
tone
.
<EOS>
"
The
portrait
is
gone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
portrait
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Richard
,
forgetting
the
previous
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
portrait
of
Isole
de
Heton
,
"
returned
Nicholas
,
becoming
more
sepulchral
in
his
accents
as
he
proceeded
;
"
it
has
vanished
from
the
wall
.
<EOS>
See
and
believe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
has
taken
it
down
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Richard
,
remarking
that
the
picture
had
certainly
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
mortal
hand
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
come
down
of
itself
.
<EOS>
I
knew
what
would
happen
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
the
fair
votaress
gave
me
the
_
clin
d'oeil_--the
wink
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
believe
me
then
--
and
now
you
see
your
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
nothing
but
the
bare
wall
,
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
see
something
anon
,
Dick
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
with
a
hollow
laugh
,
and
in
a
dismally
deep
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
Isole
herself
.
<EOS>
I
was
foolhardy
enough
to
invite
her
to
dance
the
brawl
with
me
.
<EOS>
She
smiled
her
assent
,
and
winked
at
me
thus
--
very
significantly
<EOS>
,
I
protest
to
you
--
and
she
will
be
as
good
as
her
word
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Absurd
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Absurd
,
sayest
thou
--
thou
art
<EOS>
an
infidel
,
and
believest
nothing
,
Dick
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dost
thou
not
see
that
the
picture
is
gone
?
<EOS>
She
will
be
here
presently
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
the
brawl
is
called
for
--
the
very
dance
I
invited
her
to
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
in
the
room
now
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
in
search
of
her
.
<EOS>
Look
out
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
behold
a
sight
presently
shall
make
thine
hair
stand
on
end
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
moved
away
with
a
rapid
but
uncertain
step
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
potent
wine
has
confused
his
brain
,
"
said
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
that
no
mischance
befalls
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
waving
his
hand
to
his
sister
,
he
followed
the
squire
,
who
moved
on
,
staring
inquisitively
into
the
countenance
of
every
pretty
damsel
he
encountered
.
 
<EOS>
Time
had
flown
fleetly
with
Dorothy
and
Alizon
,
who
,
occupied
with
each
other
,
had
taken
little
note
of
its
progress
,
and
were
surprised
to
find
how
quickly
the
hours
had
gone
by
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
several
dances
had
been
performed
;
a
Morisco
,
in
which
all
the
May
-
day
revellers
took
part
,
with
the
exception
of
the
queen
herself
,
who
,
notwithstanding
the
united
entreaties
of
Robin
Hood
and
her
gentleman
-
usher
,
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
join
it
:
a
trenchmore
,
a
sort
of
long
country
-
dance
,
extending
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
hall
,
and
in
which
the
whole
of
the
rustics
stood
up
:
a
galliard
,
confined
to
the
more
important
guests
,
and
in
which
both
Alizon
and
Dorothy
were
included
,
the
former
dancing
,
of
course
,
with
Richard
,
and
the
latter
with
one
of
her
cousins
,
young
Joseph
Robinson
:
and
a
jig
,
quite
promiscuous
and
unexclusive
,
and
not
the
less
merry
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
what
with
the
dances
,
which
were
of
some
duration
--
the
trenchmore
alone
occupying
more
than
an
hour
--
and
the
necessary
breathing
-
time
between
them
,
it
was
on
the
stroke
of
ten
without
any
body
being
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
Now
this
,
though
a
very
early
hour
for
a
modern
party
,
being
about
the
time
when
the
first
guest
would
arrive
,
was
a
very
late
one
even
in
fashionable
assemblages
at
the
period
in
question
,
and
the
guests
began
to
think
of
retiring
,
when
the
brawl
,
intended
to
wind
up
the
entertainment
,
was
called
.
<EOS>
The
highest
animation
still
prevailed
throughout
the
company
,
for
the
generous
host
had
taken
care
that
the
intervals
between
the
dances
should
be
well
filled
up
with
refreshments
,
and
large
bowls
of
spiced
wines
,
with
burnt
oranges
and
crabs
floating
in
them
,
were
placed
on
the
side
-
table
,
and
liberally
dispensed
to
all
applicants
.
<EOS>
Thus
all
seemed
destined
to
be
brought
to
a
happy
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
Throughout
the
evening
Alizon
had
been
closely
watched
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
remarked
,
with
feelings
akin
to
jealousy
and
distrust
,
the
marked
predilection
exhibited
by
her
for
Richard
and
Dorothy
Assheton
,
as
well
as
her
inattention
to
her
own
expressed
injunctions
in
remaining
constantly
near
them
.
<EOS>
Though
secretly
displeased
by
this
,
she
put
a
calm
face
upon
it
,
and
neither
remonstrated
by
word
or
look
.
<EOS>
Thus
Alizon
,
feeling
encouraged
in
the
course
she
had
adopted
,
and
prompted
by
her
inclinations
,
soon
forgot
the
interdiction
she
had
received
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
even
went
so
far
in
her
duplicity
as
to
promise
Dorothy
,
that
Alizon
should
pay
her
an
early
visit
at
Middleton
--
though
inwardly
resolving
no
such
visit
should
ever
take
place
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
now
received
the
proposal
very
graciously
,
and
made
Alizon
quite
happy
in
acceding
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
fain
have
her
go
back
with
me
to
Middleton
when
I
return
,
"
said
Dorothy
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
fear
you
would
not
like
to
part
with
your
newly
-
adopted
daughter
so
soon
;
neither
would
it
be
quite
fair
to
rob
you
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
hold
you
to
your
promise
of
an
early
visit
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
replied
by
a
bland
smile
,
and
then
observed
to
Alizon
that
it
was
time
for
them
to
retire
,
and
that
she
had
stayed
on
her
account
far
later
than
she
intended
--
a
mark
of
consideration
duly
appreciated
by
Alizon
.
<EOS>
Farewells
for
the
night
were
then
exchanged
between
the
two
girls
,
and
Alizon
looked
round
to
bid
adieu
to
Richard
,
but
unfortunately
,
at
this
very
juncture
,
he
was
engaged
in
pursuit
of
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
the
hall
she
made
inquiries
after
Jennet
,
and
receiving
for
answer
that
she
was
still
in
the
hall
,
but
had
fallen
asleep
in
a
chair
at
one
corner
of
the
side
-
table
,
and
could
not
be
wakened
,
she
instantly
flew
thither
and
tried
to
rouse
her
,
but
in
vain
;
when
Mistress
Nutter
,
coming
up
the
next
moment
,
merely
touched
her
brow
,
and
the
little
girl
opened
her
eyes
and
gazed
about
her
with
a
bewildered
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
unused
to
these
late
hours
,
poor
child
,
"
said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Some
one
must
be
found
to
take
her
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
go
far
in
search
of
a
convoy
,
"
said
Potts
,
who
had
been
hovering
about
,
and
now
stepped
up
;
"
I
am
going
to
the
Dragon
myself
,
and
shall
be
happy
to
take
charge
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
over
-
officious
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
,
coldly
;
"
when
we
need
your
assistance
we
will
ask
it
.
<EOS>
My
own
servant
,
Simon
Blackadder
,
will
see
her
safely
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
at
a
sign
from
her
,
a
tall
fellow
with
a
dark
,
scowling
countenance
,
came
from
among
the
other
serving
-
men
,
and
,
receiving
his
instructions
from
his
mistress
,
seized
Jennet
's
hand
,
and
strode
off
with
her
.
<EOS>
During
all
this
time
,
Mistress
Nutter
kept
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
little
girl
,
who
spoke
not
a
word
,
nor
replied
even
by
a
gesture
to
Alizon
's
affectionate
good
-
night
,
retaining
her
dazed
look
to
the
moment
of
quitting
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
her
thus
before
,
"
said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
be
the
matter
with
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
tell
you
,
"
rejoined
Potts
,
glancing
maliciously
and
significantly
at
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
darted
an
ireful
and
piercing
look
at
him
,
which
seemed
to
produce
much
the
same
consequences
as
those
experienced
by
Jennet
,
for
his
visage
instantly
elongated
,
and
he
sank
back
in
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
putting
his
hand
to
his
head
;
"
I
'm
struck
all
of
a
heap
.
<EOS>
I
feel
a
sudden
qualm
--
a
giddiness
--
a
sort
of
don't
-
know-
howishness
.
<EOS>
Ho
,
there
!
<EOS>
some
aquavitæ
--
or
imperial
water
--
or
cinnamon
water
--
or
whatever
reviving
cordial
may
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
I
feel
very
ill
--
very
ill
,
indeed
--
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
While
his
requirements
were
attended
to
,
Mistress
Nutter
moved
away
with
her
daughter
;
but
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
they
encountered
Richard
,
who
,
having
fortunately
descried
them
,
came
up
to
say
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
brawl
,
meanwhile
,
had
commenced
,
and
the
dancers
were
whirling
round
giddily
in
every
direction
,
somewhat
like
the
couples
in
a
grand
polka
,
danced
after
a
very
boisterous
,
romping
,
and
extravagant
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Nicholas
dancing
with
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mistress
Nutter
suddenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
dancing
with
any
one
?
"
rejoined
Richard
,
looking
amidst
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
see
her
?
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
a
very
beautiful
woman
with
flashing
eyes
:
<EOS>
they
move
so
quickly
,
that
I
can
scarce
discern
her
features
;
but
she
is
habited
like
a
nun
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Like
a
nun
!
"
cried
Richard
,
his
blood
growing
chill
in
his
veins
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
she
indeed
,
then
!
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yonder
,
yonder
,
whirling
madly
round
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
now
,
"
said
Richard
,
"
but
he
is
alone
.
<EOS>
He
has
lost
his
wits
to
dance
in
that
strange
manner
by
himself
.
<EOS>
How
wild
,
too
,
is
his
gaze
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
he
is
dancing
with
a
very
beautiful
woman
in
the
habit
of
a
nun
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
Strange
I
should
never
have
remarked
her
before
.
<EOS>
No
one
in
the
room
is
to
be
compared
with
her
in
loveliness
--
not
even
Alizon
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
seem
to
flash
fire
,
and
she
bounds
like
the
wild
roe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Does
she
resemble
the
portrait
of
Isole
de
Heton
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Richard
,
shuddering
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
does
--
she
does
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
See
!
<EOS>
she
whirls
past
us
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
no
one
but
Nicholas
,
"
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
,
"
added
Alizon
,
who
shared
in
the
young
man
's
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
you
behold
that
figure
?
"
said
Richard
,
drawing
Mistress
Nutter
aside
,
and
breathing
the
words
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
it
is
a
phantom
--
or
he
is
in
the
power
of
the
fiend
.
<EOS>
He
was
rash
enough
to
invite
that
wicked
votaress
,
Isole
de
Heton
,
condemned
,
it
is
said
,
to
penal
fires
for
her
earthly
enormities
,
to
dance
with
him
,
and
she
has
come
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
will
whirl
him
round
till
he
expires
,
"
cried
Richard
;
"
I
must
free
him
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
it
is
I
who
have
been
deceived
.
<EOS>
Now
I
look
again
,
I
see
that
Nicholas
is
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
nun
's
dress
--
the
wondrous
beauty
--
the
flashing
eyes
!
"
cried
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
You
described
Isole
exactly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
mere
fancy
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
just
been
looking
at
her
portrait
,
and
it
dwelt
on
my
mind
,
and
created
the
image
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
portrait
is
gone
,
"
cried
Richard
,
pointing
to
the
empty
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
looked
confounded
.
 
<EOS>
And
without
a
word
more
,
she
took
Alizon
,
who
was
full
of
alarm
and
astonishment
,
by
the
arm
,
and
hurried
her
out
of
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
disappeared
,
the
young
man
flew
towards
Nicholas
,
whose
extraordinary
proceedings
had
excited
general
amazement
.
<EOS>
The
other
dancers
had
moved
out
of
the
way
,
so
that
free
space
was
left
for
his
mad
gyrations
.
<EOS>
Greatly
scandalised
by
the
exhibition
,
which
he
looked
upon
as
the
effect
of
intoxication
,
Sir
Ralph
called
loudly
to
him
to
stop
,
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
summons
,
but
whirled
on
with
momently
-
increasing
velocity
,
oversetting
old
Adam
Whitworth
,
Gregory
,
and
Dickon
,
who
severally
ventured
to
place
themselves
in
his
path
,
to
enforce
their
master
's
injunctions
,
until
at
last
,
just
as
Richard
reached
him
,
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
and
fell
to
the
ground
insensible
.
<EOS>
By
Sir
Ralph
's
command
he
was
instantly
lifted
up
and
transported
to
his
own
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
This
unexpected
and
extraordinary
incident
put
an
end
to
the
ball
,
and
the
whole
of
the
guests
,
after
taking
a
respectful
and
grateful
leave
of
the
host
,
departed
--
not
in
"
most
admired
"
disorder
,
but
full
of
wonder
.
<EOS>
By
most
persons
the
squire
's
"
fantastical
vagaries
,
"
as
they
were
termed
,
were
traced
to
the
vast
quantity
of
wine
he
had
drunk
,
but
a
few
others
shook
their
heads
,
and
said
he
was
evidently
bewitched
,
and
that
Mother
Chattox
and
Nance
Redferne
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
portrait
of
Isole
de
Heton
,
it
was
found
under
the
table
,
and
it
was
said
that
Nicholas
himself
had
pulled
it
down
;
but
this
he
obstinately
denied
,
when
afterwards
taken
to
task
for
his
indecorous
behaviour
;
and
to
his
dying
day
he
asserted
,
and
believed
,
that
he
had
danced
the
brawl
with
Isole
de
Heton
.
<EOS>
"
And
never
,
"
he
would
say
,
"
had
mortal
man
such
a
partner
.
"
 
<EOS>
From
that
night
the
two
portraits
in
the
banqueting
-
hall
were
regarded
with
great
awe
by
the
inmates
of
the
Abbey
.

CHAPTER
X.--THE
NOCTURNAL
MEETING
.
  
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
head
of
the
staircase
leading
to
the
corridor
,
Mistress
Nutter
,
whose
movements
had
hitherto
been
extremely
rapid
,
paused
with
her
daughter
to
listen
to
the
sounds
arising
from
below
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
was
heard
a
loud
cry
,
and
the
music
,
which
had
waxed
fast
and
furious
in
order
to
keep
pace
with
the
frenzied
boundings
of
the
squire
,
ceased
at
once
,
showing
some
interruption
had
occurred
,
while
from
the
confused
noise
that
ensued
,
it
was
evident
the
sudden
stoppage
had
been
the
result
of
accident
.
<EOS>
With
blanched
cheek
Alizon
listened
,
scarcely
daring
to
look
at
her
mother
,
whose
expression
of
countenance
,
revealed
by
the
lamp
she
held
in
her
hand
,
almost
frightened
her
;
and
it
was
a
great
relief
to
hear
the
voices
and
laughter
of
the
serving
-
men
as
they
came
forth
with
Nicholas
,
and
bore
him
towards
another
part
of
the
mansion
;
and
though
much
shocked
,
she
was
glad
when
one
of
them
,
who
appeared
to
be
Nicholas
's
own
servant
,
assured
the
others
"
that
it
was
only
a
drunken
fit
and
that
the
squire
would
wake
up
next
morning
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
"
 
<EOS>
Apparently
satisfied
with
this
explanation
,
Mistress
Nutter
moved
on
;
but
a
new
feeling
of
uneasiness
came
over
Alizon
as
she
followed
her
down
the
long
dusky
corridor
,
in
the
direction
of
the
mysterious
chamber
,
where
they
were
to
pass
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
fitful
flame
of
the
lamp
fell
upon
many
a
grim
painting
depicting
the
sufferings
of
the
early
martyrs
;
and
these
ghastly
representations
did
not
serve
to
re
-
assure
her
.
<EOS>
The
grotesque
carvings
on
the
panels
and
ribs
of
the
vaulted
roof
,
likewise
impressed
her
with
vague
terror
,
and
there
was
one
large
piece
of
sculpture
--
Saint
Theodora
subjected
to
diabolical
temptation
,
as
described
in
the
Golden
Legend
--
that
absolutely
scared
her
.
<EOS>
Their
footsteps
echoed
hollowly
overhead
,
and
more
than
once
,
deceived
by
the
sound
,
Alizon
turned
to
see
if
any
one
was
behind
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
corridor
lay
the
room
once
occupied
by
the
superior
of
the
religious
establishment
,
and
still
known
from
that
circumstance
as
the
"
Abbot
's
Chamber
.
<EOS>
"
Connected
with
this
apartment
was
the
beautiful
oratory
built
by
Paslew
,
wherein
he
had
kept
his
last
vigils
;
and
though
now
no
longer
applied
to
purposes
of
worship
,
still
wearing
from
the
character
of
its
architecture
,
its
sculptured
ornaments
,
and
the
painted
glass
in
its
casements
,
a
dim
religious
air
.
<EOS>
The
abbot
's
room
was
allotted
to
Dorothy
Assheton
;
and
from
its
sombre
magnificence
,
as
well
as
the
ghostly
tales
connected
with
it
,
had
impressed
her
with
so
much
superstitious
misgiving
,
that
she
besought
Alizon
to
share
her
couch
with
her
,
but
the
young
girl
did
not
dare
to
assent
.
<EOS>
Just
,
however
,
as
Mistress
Nutter
was
about
to
enter
her
own
room
,
Dorothy
appeared
on
the
corridor
,
and
,
calling
to
Alizon
to
stay
a
moment
,
flew
quickly
towards
her
,
and
renewed
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
Alizon
looked
at
her
mother
,
but
the
latter
decidedly
,
and
somewhat
sternly
,
negatived
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
girls
then
said
good
-
night
,
kissing
each
other
affectionately
,
after
which
Alizon
entered
the
room
with
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
the
door
was
closed
.
<EOS>
Two
tapers
were
burning
on
the
dressing
-
table
,
and
their
light
fell
upon
the
carved
figures
of
the
wardrobe
,
which
still
exercised
the
same
weird
influence
over
her
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
neither
seemed
disposed
to
retire
to
rest
immediately
,
nor
willing
to
talk
,
but
sat
down
,
and
was
soon
lost
in
thought
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
,
an
impulse
of
curiosity
which
she
could
not
resist
,
prompted
Alizon
to
peep
into
the
closet
,
and
pushing
aside
the
tapestry
,
partly
drawn
over
the
entrance
,
she
held
the
lamp
forward
so
as
to
throw
its
light
into
the
little
chamber
.
<EOS>
A
mere
glance
was
all
she
was
allowed
,
but
it
sufficed
to
show
her
the
large
oak
chest
,
though
the
monkish
robe
lately
suspended
above
it
,
and
which
had
particularly
attracted
her
attention
,
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
had
noticed
the
movement
,
and
instantly
and
somewhat
sharply
recalled
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
Alizon
obeyed
,
a
slight
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
young
girl
turned
pale
,
for
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
any
little
matter
affected
her
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
her
apprehensions
materially
allayed
by
the
entrance
of
Dorothy
,
who
,
looking
white
as
a
sheet
,
said
she
did
not
dare
to
remain
in
her
own
room
,
having
been
terribly
frightened
,
by
seeing
a
monkish
figure
in
mouldering
white
garments
,
exactly
resembling
one
of
the
carved
images
on
the
wardrobe
,
issue
from
behind
the
hangings
on
the
wall
,
and
glide
into
the
oratory
,
and
she
entreated
Mistress
Nutter
to
let
Alizon
go
back
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
request
was
peremptorily
refused
,
and
the
lady
,
ridiculing
Dorothy
for
her
fears
,
bade
her
return
;
but
she
still
lingered
.
<EOS>
This
relation
filled
Alizon
with
inexpressible
alarm
,
for
though
she
did
not
dare
to
allude
to
the
disappearance
of
the
monkish
gown
,
she
could
not
help
connecting
the
circumstance
with
the
ghostly
figure
seen
by
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
Unable
otherwise
to
get
rid
of
the
terrified
intruder
,
whose
presence
was
an
evident
restraint
to
her
,
Mistress
Nutter
,
at
length
,
consented
to
accompany
her
to
her
room
,
and
convince
her
of
the
folly
of
her
fears
,
by
an
examination
of
the
oratory
.
<EOS>
Alizon
went
with
them
,
her
mother
not
choosing
to
leave
her
behind
,
and
indeed
she
herself
was
most
anxious
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
The
abbot
's
chamber
was
large
and
gloomy
,
nearly
twice
the
size
of
the
room
occupied
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
but
resembling
it
in
many
respects
,
as
well
as
in
the
No
interdusky
hue
of
its
hangings
and
furniture
,
most
of
which
had
been
undisturbed
since
the
days
of
Paslew
.
<EOS>
The
very
bed
,
of
carved
oak
,
was
that
in
which
he
had
slept
,
and
his
arms
were
still
displayed
upon
it
,
and
on
the
painted
glass
of
the
windows
.
<EOS>
As
Alizon
entered
she
looked
round
with
apprehension
,
but
nothing
occurred
to
justify
her
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
Having
raised
the
arras
,
from
behind
which
Dorothy
averred
the
figure
had
issued
,
and
discovering
nothing
but
a
panel
of
oak
;
with
a
smile
of
incredulity
,
Mistress
Nutter
walked
boldly
towards
the
oratory
,
the
two
girls
,
hand
in
hand
,
following
tremblingly
after
her
;
but
no
fearful
object
met
their
view
.
<EOS>
A
dressing
-
table
,
with
a
large
mirror
upon
it
,
occupied
the
spot
where
the
altar
had
formerly
stood
;
but
,
in
spite
of
this
,
and
of
other
furniture
,
the
little
place
of
prayer
,
as
has
previously
been
observed
,
retained
much
of
its
original
character
,
and
seemed
more
calculated
to
inspire
sentiments
of
devotional
awe
than
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
After
remaining
for
a
short
time
in
the
oratory
,
during
which
she
pointed
out
the
impossibility
of
any
one
being
concealed
there
,
Mistress
Nutter
assured
Dorothy
she
might
rest
quite
easy
that
nothing
further
would
occur
to
alarm
her
,
and
recommending
her
to
lose
the
sense
of
her
fears
as
speedily
as
she
could
in
sleep
,
took
her
departure
with
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
recommendation
was
of
little
avail
.
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
's
heart
died
within
her
,
and
all
her
former
terrors
returned
,
and
with
additional
force
.
<EOS>
Sitting
down
,
she
looked
fixedly
at
the
hangings
till
her
eyes
ached
,
and
then
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
,
and
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
,
she
listened
intently
for
the
slightest
sound
.
<EOS>
A
rustle
would
have
made
her
scream
--
but
all
was
still
as
death
,
so
profoundly
quiet
,
that
the
very
hush
and
silence
became
a
new
cause
of
disquietude
,
and
longing
for
some
cheerful
sound
to
break
it
,
she
would
have
spoken
aloud
but
from
a
fear
of
hearing
her
own
voice
.
<EOS>
A
book
lay
before
her
,
and
she
essayed
to
read
it
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
was
ever
glancing
fearfully
round
--
ever
listening
intently
.
<EOS>
This
state
could
not
endure
for
ever
,
and
feeling
a
drowsiness
steal
over
her
she
yielded
to
it
,
and
at
length
dropped
asleep
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
Her
dreams
,
however
,
were
influenced
by
her
mental
condition
,
and
slumber
was
no
refuge
,
as
promised
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
from
the
hauntings
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
a
jarring
sound
aroused
her
,
and
she
found
she
had
been
awakened
by
the
clock
striking
twelve
.
<EOS>
Her
lamp
required
trimming
and
burnt
dimly
,
but
by
its
imperfect
light
she
saw
the
arras
move
.
<EOS>
This
could
be
no
fancy
,
for
the
next
moment
the
hangings
were
raised
,
and
a
figure
looked
from
behind
them
;
and
this
time
it
was
not
the
monk
,
but
a
female
robed
in
white
.
<EOS>
A
glimpse
of
the
figure
was
all
Dorothy
caught
,
for
it
instantly
retreated
,
and
the
tapestry
fell
back
to
its
place
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Scared
by
this
apparition
,
Dorothy
rushed
out
of
the
room
so
hurriedly
that
she
forgot
to
take
her
lamp
,
and
made
her
way
,
she
scarcely
knew
how
,
to
the
adjoining
chamber
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
tap
at
the
door
,
but
trying
it
,
and
finding
it
unfastened
,
opened
it
softly
,
and
closed
it
after
her
,
resolved
if
the
occupants
of
the
room
were
asleep
not
to
disturb
them
,
but
to
pass
the
night
in
a
chair
,
the
presence
of
some
living
beings
beside
her
sufficing
,
in
some
degree
,
to
dispel
her
terrors
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
buried
in
darkness
,
the
tapers
being
extinguished
.
 
<EOS>
Advancing
on
tiptoe
she
soon
discovered
a
seat
,
when
what
was
her
surprise
to
find
Alizon
asleep
within
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
sure
it
was
Alizon
--
for
she
had
touched
her
hair
and
face
,
and
she
felt
surprised
that
the
contact
had
not
awakened
her
.
<EOS>
Still
more
surprised
<EOS>
did
she
feel
that
the
young
girl
had
not
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Again
she
stepped
forward
in
search
of
another
chair
,
when
a
gleam
of
light
suddenly
shot
from
one
side
of
the
bed
,
and
the
tapestry
,
masking
the
entrance
to
the
closet
,
was
slowly
drawn
aside
.
<EOS>
From
behind
it
,
the
next
moment
,
appeared
the
same
female
figure
,
robed
in
white
,
that
she
had
previously
beheld
in
the
abbot
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
figure
held
a
lamp
in
one
hand
,
and
a
small
box
in
the
other
,
and
,
to
her
unspeakable
horror
,
disclosed
the
livid
and
contorted
countenance
of
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
[

ALARMED

AT

THE
APPEARANCE
OF
MRS
.
NUTTER
.
]
 
<EOS>
Dreadful
though
undefined
suspicions
crossed
her
mind
,
and
she
feared
,
if
discovered
,
she
should
be
sacrificed
to
the
fury
of
this
strange
and
terrible
woman
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
where
she
stood
,
though
Mistress
Nutter
was
revealed
to
her
,
she
herself
was
screened
from
view
by
the
hangings
of
the
bed
,
and
looking
around
for
a
hiding
-
place
,
she
observed
that
the
mysterious
wardrobe
,
close
behind
her
,
was
open
,
and
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
she
slipped
into
the
covert
and
drew
the
door
to
,
noiselessly
.
<EOS>
But
her
curiosity
overmastered
her
fear
,
and
,
firmly
believing
some
magical
rite
was
about
to
be
performed
,
she
sought
for
means
of
beholding
it
;
nor
was
she
long
in
discovering
a
small
eyelet
-
hole
in
the
carving
which
commanded
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Unconscious
of
any
other
presence
than
that
of
Alizon
,
whose
stupor
appeared
to
occasion
her
<EOS>
no
uneasiness
,
Mistress
Nutter
,
placed
the
lamp
upon
the
table
,
made
fast
the
door
,
and
,
muttering
some
unintelligible
words
,
unlocked
the
box
.
<EOS>
It
contained
two
singularly
-
shaped
glass
vessels
,
the
one
filled
with
a
bright
sparkling
liquid
,
and
the
other
with
a
greenish
-
coloured
unguent
.
<EOS>
Pouring
forth
a
few
drops
of
the
liquid
into
a
glass
near
her
,
Mistress
Nutter
swallowed
them
,
and
then
taking
some
of
the
unguent
upon
her
hands
,
proceeded
to
anoint
her
face
and
neck
with
it
,
exclaiming
as
she
did
so
,
"
Emen
hetan
!
<EOS>
Emen
hetan!"--words
that
fixed
themselves
upon
the
listener
's
memory
.
 
<EOS>
Wondering
what
would
follow
,
Dorothy
gazed
on
,
when
she
suddenly
lost
sight
of
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
after
looking
for
her
as
far
as
her
range
of
vision
,
limited
by
the
aperture
,
would
extend
,
she
became
convinced
that
she
had
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
All
remaining
quiet
,
she
ventured
,
after
awhile
,
to
quit
her
hiding
-
place
,
and
flying
to
Alizon
,
tried
to
waken
her
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
retained
the
same
moveless
attitude
,
and
appeared
plunged
in
a
deathly
stupor
.
 
<EOS>
Much
frightened
,
Dorothy
resolved
to
alarm
the
house
,
but
some
fears
of
Mistress
Nutter
restrained
her
,
and
she
crept
towards
the
closet
to
see
whether
that
dread
lady
could
be
there
.
<EOS>
All
was
perfectly
still
;
and
somewhat
emboldened
,
she
returned
to
the
table
,
where
the
box
,
which
was
left
open
and
its
contents
unguarded
,
attracted
her
attention
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
the
liquid
in
the
phial
?
<EOS>
What
could
it
do
?
<EOS>
These
were
questions
she
asked
herself
,
and
longing
to
try
the
effect
,
she
ventured
at
last
to
pour
forth
a
few
drops
and
taste
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
a
potent
distillation
,
and
she
became
instantly
sensible
of
a
strange
bewildering
excitement
.
<EOS>
Presently
her
brain
reeled
,
and
she
laughed
wildly
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
she
felt
so
light
and
buoyant
,
and
wings
seemed
scarcely
wanting
to
enable
her
to
fly
.
<EOS>
An
idea
occurred
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
wondrous
liquid
might
arouse
Alizon
.
<EOS>
The
experiment
should
be
tried
at
once
,
and
,
dipping
her
finger
in
the
phial
,
she
touched
the
lips
of
the
sleeper
,
who
sighed
deeply
and
opened
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Another
drop
,
and
Alizon
was
on
her
feet
,
gazing
at
her
in
astonishment
,
and
laughing
wildly
as
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
girls
!
<EOS>
how
wild
and
strange
they
looked
--
and
how
unlike
themselves
!
 
<EOS>
"
Whither
are
you
going
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
moon
!
<EOS>
to
the
stars!--any
where
!
"
rejoined
Dorothy
,
with
a
laugh
of
frantic
glee
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
with
you
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
echoing
the
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
and
there!--here
and
there
!
"
exclaimed
Dorothy
,
taking
her
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Emen
hetan
!
<EOS>
Emen
hetan
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
mystic
words
were
uttered
they
started
away
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
no
impediments
could
stop
them
;
how
they
crossed
the
closet
,
passed
through
a
sliding
panel
into
the
abbot
's
room
,
entered
the
oratory
,
and
from
it
descended
,
by
a
secret
staircase
,
to
the
garden
,
they
knew
not
--
but
there
they
were
,
gliding
swiftly
along
in
the
moonlight
,
like
winged
spirits
.
<EOS>
What
took
them
towards
the
conventual
church
they
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
drawn
thither
,
as
the
ship
was
irresistibly
dragged
towards
the
loadstone
rock
described
in
the
Eastern
legend
.
<EOS>
Nothing
surprised
them
then
,
or
they
might
have
been
struck
by
the
dense
vapour
,
enveloping
the
monastic
ruins
,
and
shrouding
them
from
view
;
nor
was
it
until
they
entered
the
desecrated
fabric
,
that
any
consciousness
of
what
was
passing
around
returned
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Their
ears
were
then
assailed
by
a
wild
hubbub
of
discordant
sounds
,
hootings
and
croakings
as
of
owls
and
ravens
,
shrieks
and
jarring
cries
as
of
night
-
birds
,
bellowings
as
of
cattle
,
groans
and
dismal
sounds
,
mixed
with
unearthly
laughter
.
<EOS>
Undefined
and
extraordinary
shapes
,
whether
men
or
women
,
beings
of
this
world
or
of
another
they
could
not
tell
,
though
they
judged
them
the
latter
,
flew
past
with
wild
whoops
and
piercing
cries
,
flapping
the
air
as
if
with
great
leathern
bat
-
like
wings
,
or
bestriding
black
,
monstrous
,
misshapen
steeds
.
<EOS>
Fantastical
and
grotesque
were
these
objects
,
yet
hideous
and
appalling
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
a
red
and
fiery
star
would
whiz
crackling
through
the
air
,
and
then
exploding
break
into
numerous
pale
phosphoric
lights
,
that
danced
awhile
overhead
,
and
then
flitted
away
among
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
The
ground
seemed
to
heave
and
tremble
beneath
the
footsteps
,
as
if
the
graves
were
opening
to
give
forth
their
dead
,
while
toads
and
hissing
reptiles
crept
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Appalled
,
yet
partly
restored
to
herself
by
this
confused
and
horrible
din
,
Alizon
stood
still
and
kept
fast
hold
of
Dorothy
,
who
,
seemingly
under
a
stronger
influence
than
herself
,
was
drawn
towards
the
eastern
end
of
the
fane
,
where
a
fire
appeared
to
be
blazing
,
a
strong
ruddy
glare
being
cast
upon
the
broken
roof
of
the
choir
,
and
the
mouldering
arches
around
it
.
<EOS>
The
noises
around
them
suddenly
ceased
,
and
all
the
uproar
seemed
concentrated
near
the
spot
where
the
fire
was
burning
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
besought
her
friend
so
earnestly
to
let
her
see
what
was
going
forward
,
that
Alizon
reluctantly
and
tremblingly
assented
,
and
they
moved
slowly
towards
the
transept
,
taking
care
to
keep
under
the
shelter
of
the
columns
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
last
pillar
,
behind
which
they
remained
,
an
extraordinary
and
fearful
spectacle
burst
upon
them
.
<EOS>
As
they
had
supposed
,
a
large
fire
was
burning
in
the
midst
of
the
choir
,
the
smoke
of
which
,
ascending
in
eddying
wreaths
,
formed
a
dark
canopy
overhead
,
where
it
was
mixed
with
the
steam
issuing
from
a
large
black
bubbling
caldron
set
on
the
blazing
embers
.
<EOS>
Around
the
fire
were
ranged
,
in
a
wide
circle
,
an
assemblage
of
men
and
women
,
but
chiefly
the
latter
,
and
of
these
almost
all
old
,
hideous
,
and
of
malignant
aspect
,
their
grim
and
sinister
features
looking
ghastly
in
the
lurid
light
.
<EOS>
Above
them
,
amid
the
smoke
and
steam
,
wheeled
bat
and
flitter
-
mouse
,
horned
owl
and
screech
-
owl
,
in
mazy
circles
.
<EOS>
The
weird
assemblage
chattered
together
in
some
wild
jargon
,
mumbling
and
muttering
spells
and
incantations
,
chanting
fearfully
with
hoarse
,
cracked
voices
a
wild
chorus
,
and
anon
breaking
into
a
loud
and
long
-
continued
peal
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
more
mumbling
,
chattering
,
and
singing
,
and
one
of
the
troop
producing
a
wallet
,
hobbled
forward
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
fearful
old
crone
;
hunchbacked
,
toothless
,
blear
-
eyed
,
bearded
,
halt
,
with
huge
gouty
feet
swathed
in
flannel
.
<EOS>
As
she
cast
in
the
ingredients
one
by
one
,
she
chanted
thus:--
            
"
Head
of
monkey
,
brain
of
cat
,
           
Eye
of
weasel
,
tail
of

Juice
of
mugwort
,
mastic
,
myrrh--
           
<EOS>
All
within
the
pot
I
stir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
sung
,
Mother
Mould
-
heels
,
"
cried
a
little
old
man
,
whose
doublet
and
hose
were
of
rusty
black
,
with
a
short
cloak
,
of
the
same
hue
,
over
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
sung
,
Mother
Mould
-
heels
,
"
he
cried
,
advancing
as
the
old
witch
retired
,
amidst
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
others
,
and
chanting
as
he
filled
the
caldron
:
           
<EOS>
"
Here
is
foam
from
a
mad
dog
's
lips
,
           
Gather'd
beneath
the
moon

eclipse
,
           
Ashes
of
a
shroud
consumed
,
           
<EOS>
And
with
deadly
vapour
fumed
.
           
<EOS>
These
within
the
mess
<EOS>
I
cast--
           
Stir
the
caldron
--
stir
it
fast
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
red
-
haired
witch
then
took
his
place
,
singing
,
           
<EOS>
"
Here
are
snakes
from
out
the
river
,
           
Bones

<EOS>
Nance
Redferne
then
advanced
,
and
,
taking
from
her
wallet
a
small
clay
image
,
tricked
out
in
attire
intended
to
resemble
that
of
James
Device
,
plunged
several
pins
deeply
into
its
breast
,
singing
as
she
did
so
,
thus,--
           
<EOS>
"
In
his

In

<EOS>
Ye
may
know
it
,
as
I
show
it
!
           
<EOS>
In
its
breast
sharp
pins
I
stick
,
           
<EOS>
And
I
drive
them
to
the
quick
.
           
<EOS>
They
are
in
<EOS>
--
they
are
in--
           
<EOS>
And
the
wretch

begin
.
           
<EOS>
Now
his
heart
,
           
Feels
the
smart
;
           
Through
his
marrow
,
           
Sharp
as

,
           
<EOS>
Torments

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Unavailingly
.
           
<EOS>
Aches
shall
rack
him
,
           
Cramps
attack
him
,

He

<EOS>
Strength

Till

Miserably

"
 
<EOS>
As
Nance
retired
,
another
witch
advanced
,
and
sung
thus
:
           
"
Over

over

we
have
come

frantic

<EOS>
And
the
reason

is
to

<EOS>
Who
this

shall
               
added
be

"
 
<EOS>
A
wild
burst
of
laughter
followed
this
address
,
and
another
wizard
succeeded
,
chanting
thus
:
           
<EOS>
"
Beat
the
water
,
Demdike

daughter

<EOS>
Till
the

o'er
us
;
           
Till

And

<EOS>
Ruin

"
 
<EOS>
As
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
woman
stepped
from
out
the
circle
,
and
throwing
back
the
grey
-
hooded
cloak
in
which
she
was
enveloped
,
disclosed
the
features
of
Elizabeth
Device
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
in
that
fearful
assemblage
occasioned
no
surprise
to
Alizon
,
though
it
increased
her
horror
.
<EOS>
A
pail
of
water
was
next
set
before
the
witch
,
and
a
broom
being
placed
in
her
hand
,
she
struck
the
lymph
with
it
,
sprinkling
it
aloft
,
and
uttering
this
spell
:
           
"
Mount

<EOS>
Bid

Bid

Bid

the

Bid

Bid

the

amain

Thunder

THE
INCANTATION

<EOS>
As
she
concluded
,
clouds
gathered
thickly
overhead
,
obscuring
the
stars
that
had
hitherto
shone
down
from
the
heavens
.
<EOS>
The
wind
suddenly
arose
,
but
in
lieu
of
dispersing
the
vapours
it
seemed
only
to
condense
them
.
<EOS>
A
flash
of
forked
lightning
cut
through
the
air
,
and
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
rolled
overhead
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
whole
troop
sang
together--
           
<EOS>
"
Beat
the
water
,
Demdike
's
daughter
!

Lightning

<EOS>
thunder
crashes

<EOS>
Wild
winds
sing
in
lusty
chorus
!
"
 
<EOS>
For
a
brief
space
the
storm
raged
fearfully
,
and
recalled
the
terror
of
that
previously
witnessed
by
Alizon
,
which
she
now
began
to
think
might
have
originated
in
a
similar
manner
.
<EOS>
The
wind
raved
around
the
ruined
pile
,
but
its
breath
was
not
felt
within
it
,
and
the
rain
was
heard
descending
in
deluging
showers
without
,
though
no
drop
came
through
the
open
roof
.
<EOS>
The
thunder
shook
the
walls
and
pillars
of
the
old
fabric
,
and
threatened
to
topple
them
down
from
their
foundations
,
but
they
resisted
the
shocks
.
<EOS>
The
lightning
played
around
the
tall
spire
springing
from
this
part
of
the
fane
,
and
ran
down
from
its
shattered
summit
to
its
base
,
without
doing
any
damage
.
<EOS>
The
red
bolts
struck
the
ground
innocuously
,
though
they
fell
at
the
very
feet
of
the
weird
assemblage
,
who
laughed
wildly
at
the
awful
tumult
.
 
<EOS>
Whilst
the
storm
was
at
its
worst
,
while
the
lightning
was
flashing
fiercely
,
and
the
thunder
rattling
loudly
,
Mother
Chattox
,
with
a
chafing
-
dish
in
her
hand
,
advanced
towards
the
fire
,
and
placing
the
pan
upon
it
,
threw
certain
herbs
and
roots
into
it
,
chanting
thus:--
            
<EOS>
"
Here
is
juice
of
poppy
bruised
,
           
With
black
hellebore
infused
;
           
Here
is
mandrake
's
bleeding
root
,
           
Mixed
with
moonshade
's
deadly
fruit
;
           
Viper
's
bag
with
venom
fill'd
,
           
<EOS>
Taken
ere
the
beast
was
kill'd
;
           
Adder
's
skin
and
raven
's
feather
,
           
With
shell
of
beetle
blent
together
;
           
Dragonwort
and
barbatus
,
           
Hemlock
black
and
poisonous
;
           
Horn
of
hart
,
and
storax
red
,
           
Lapwing
's
blood
,
at
midnight
shed
.
           
<EOS>
In
the
heated
pan
they
burn
,
           
And
to
pungent
vapours
turn
.
           
<EOS>
By
this
strong
suffumigation
,
           
By
this
potent
invocation
,
           
Spirits
!
<EOS>
I
compel
you
here
!
           
<EOS>
All
who
list
may
call
appear
!
"
 
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
pause
,
she
resumed
as
follows:--
           
"
White
-
robed
brethren
,
who
of
old
,
           
Nightly
paced
yon
cloisters
cold
,
           
Sleeping
now
beneath
the
mould
!
                              
<EOS>
I
bid
ye
rise
.
           
<EOS>
"
Abbots
!
<EOS>
by
the
weakling
fear'd
,
           
<EOS>
By
the
credulous
revered
,
           
Who
this
mighty
fabric
rear'd
!
                              
<EOS>
I
bid
ye
rise
!
           
<EOS>
"
And
thou
last
and
guilty
one
!
           
<EOS>
By
thy
lust
of
power
undone
,
           
Whom
in
death
thy
fellows
shun
!
                              
<EOS>
I
bid
thee
come
!
           
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
thou
fair
one
,
who
disdain'd
           
<EOS>
To
keep
the
vows
thy
lips
had
feign'd
;
           
And
<EOS>
thy
snowy
garments
stain'd
!
                              
<EOS>
I
bid
thee
come
!
"
 
<EOS>
During
this
invocation
,
the
glee
of
the
assemblage
ceased
,
and
they
looked
around
in
hushed
expectation
of
the
result
.
<EOS>
Slowly
then
did
a
long
procession
of
monkish
forms
,
robed
in
white
,
glide
along
the
aisles
,
and
gather
round
the
altar
.
<EOS>
The
brass
-
covered
stones
within
the
presbytery
were
lifted
up
,
as
if
they
moved
on
hinges
,
and
from
the
yawning
graves
beneath
them
arose
solemn
shapes
,
sixteen
in
number
,
each
with
mitre
on
head
and
crosier
in
hand
,
which
likewise
proceeded
to
the
altar
.
<EOS>
Then
a
loud
cry
was
heard
,
and
from
a
side
chapel
burst
the
monkish
form
,
in
mouldering
garments
,
which
Dorothy
had
seen
enter
the
oratory
,
and
which
would
have
mingled
with
its
brethren
at
the
altar
,
but
they
waved
it
off
menacingly
.
<EOS>
Another
piercing
shriek
followed
,
and
a
female
shape
,
habited
like
a
nun
,
and
of
surpassing
loveliness
,
issued
from
the
opposite
chapel
,
and
hovered
near
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Content
with
this
proof
of
her
power
,
Mother
Chattox
waved
her
hand
,
and
the
long
shadowy
train
glided
off
as
they
came
.
<EOS>
The
ghostly
abbots
returned
to
their
tombs
,
and
the
stones
closed
over
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
shades
of
Paslew
and
Isole
de
Heton
still
lingered
.
 
<EOS>
The
storm
had
wellnigh
ceased
,
the
thunder
rolled
hollowly
at
intervals
,
and
a
flash
of
lightning
now
and
then
licked
the
walls
.
<EOS>
The
weird
crew
had
resumed
their
rites
,
when
the
door
of
the
Lacy
chapel
flew
open
,
and
a
tall
female
figure
came
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
doubted
if
she
beheld
aright
.
<EOS>
Could
that
terrific
woman
in
the
strangely
-
fashioned
robe
of
white
,
girt
by
a
brazen
zone
graven
with
mystic
characters
,
with
a
long
glittering
blade
in
her
hand
,
infernal
fury
in
her
wildly
-
rolling
orbs
,
the
livid
hue
of
death
on
her
cheeks
,
and
the
red
brand
upon
her
brow
--
could
that
fearful
woman
,
with
the
black
dishevelled
tresses
floating
over
her
bare
shoulders
,
and
whose
gestures
were
so
imperious
,
be
Mistress
Nutter
?
<EOS>
Mother
no
longer
,
if
it
indeed
were
she
!
<EOS>
How
came
she
there
amid
that
weird
assemblage
?
<EOS>
Why
did
they
so
humbly
salute
her
,
and
fall
prostrate
before
her
,
kissing
the
hem
of
her
garment
?
<EOS>
Why
did
she
stand
proudly
in
the
midst
of
them
,
and
extend
her
hand
,
armed
with
the
knife
,
over
them
?
<EOS>
Was
she
their
sovereign
mistress
,
that
they
bent
so
lowly
at
her
coming
,
and
rose
so
reverentially
at
her
bidding
?
<EOS>
Was
this
terrible
woman
,
now
seated
oh
a
dilapidated
tomb
,
and
regarding
the
dark
conclave
with
the
eye
of
a
queen
who
held
their
lives
in
her
hands
--
<EOS>
was
she
her
mother
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
no!--no!--it
could
not
be
!
<EOS>
It
must
be
some
fiend
that
usurped
her
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
though
Alizon
thus
strove
to
discredit
the
evidence
of
her
senses
,
and
to
hold
all
she
saw
to
be
delusion
,
and
the
work
of
darkness
,
she
could
not
entirely
convince
herself
,
but
imperfectly
recalling
the
fearful
vision
she
had
witnessed
during
her
former
stupor
,
began
to
connect
it
with
the
scene
now
passing
before
her
.
<EOS>
The
storm
had
wholly
ceased
,
and
the
stars
again
twinkled
down
through
the
shattered
roof
.
<EOS>
Deep
silence
prevailed
,
broken
only
by
the
hissing
and
bubbling
of
the
caldron
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
's
gaze
was
riveted
upon
her
mother
,
whose
slightest
gestures
she
watched
.
<EOS>
After
numbering
the
assemblage
thrice
,
Mistress
Nutter
majestically
arose
,
and
motioning
Mother
Chattox
towards
her
,
the
old
witch
tremblingly
advanced
,
and
some
words
passed
between
them
,
the
import
of
which
did
not
reach
the
listener
's
ear
.
<EOS>
In
conclusion
,
however
,
Mistress
Nutter
exclaimed
aloud
,
in
accents
of
command--"Go
,
bring
it
at
once
,
the
sacrifice
must
be
made
.
<EOS>
"--And
on
this
,
Mother
Chattox
hobbled
off
to
one
of
the
side
chapels
.
 
<EOS>
A
mortal
terror
seized
Alizon
,
and
she
could
scarcely
draw
breath
.
<EOS>
Dark
tales
had
been
told
her
that
unbaptised
infants
were
sometimes
sacrificed
by
witches
,
and
their
flesh
boiled
and
devoured
at
their
impious
banquets
,
and
dreading
lest
some
such
atrocity
was
now
about
to
be
practised
,
she
mustered
all
her
resolution
,
determined
,
at
any
risk
,
to
interfere
,
and
,
if
possible
,
prevent
its
accomplishment
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
Mother
Chattox
returned
bearing
some
living
thing
,
wrapped
in
a
white
cloth
,
which
struggled
feebly
for
liberation
,
apparently
confirming
Alizon
's
suspicions
,
and
she
was
about
to
rush
forward
,
when
Mistress
Nutter
,
snatching
the
bundle
from
the
old
witch
,
opened
it
,
and
disclosed
a
beautiful
bird
,
with
plumage
white
as
driven
snow
,
whose
legs
were
tied
together
,
so
that
it
could
not
escape
.
<EOS>
Conjecturing
what
was
to
follow
,
Alizon
averted
her
eyes
,
and
when
she
looked
round
again
the
bird
had
been
slain
,
while
Mother
Chattox
was
in
the
act
of
throwing
its
body
into
the
caldron
,
muttering
a
charm
as
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
held
the
ensanguined
knife
aloft
,
and
casting
some
ruddy
drops
upon
the
glowing
embers
,
pronounced
,
as
they
hissed
and
smoked
,
<EOS>
the
following
adjuration:--
           
"
Thy
aid
I
seek
,
infernal
Power
!
           
<EOS>
Be
thy
word
sent
to
Malkin
Tower
,
           
<EOS>
That
the
beldame
old
may
know
           
Where
I
will
,
thou'dst
have
her
go--
           
<EOS>
What
I
will
,
thou'dst
have
her
do
!
"
 
<EOS>
An
immediate
response
was
made
by
an
awful
voice
issuing
apparently
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
.
           
<EOS>
"
Thou
who
seek'st
the
Demon
's
aid
,
           
Know'st
<EOS>
the
price
that
must
be
paid
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
queen
witch
rejoined--
           
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
But
grant
the
aid
I
crave
,
           
And
that
thou
wishest
thou
shalt
have
.
           
<EOS>
Another
worshipper
is
won
,
           
<EOS>
Thine
to
be
,
when
all
is
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
Again
the
deep
voice
spake
,
with
something
of
mockery
in
its
accents:--
            
"
Enough
proud
witch
,
I
am
content
.
           
<EOS>
To
Malkin
Tower
<EOS>
the
word
is
sent
,
           
Forth
to
her
task
the
beldame
goes
,
           
And
<EOS>
where
she
points
the
streamlet
flows
;
           
Its
customary
bed
forsaking
,
           
Another
distant
channel
making
.
           
<EOS>
Round
about
like
elfets
tripping
,
           
Stock
and
stone
,
and
tree
are
skipping
;
           
<EOS>
Halting
where
she
plants
her
staff
,
           
With
a
wild
exulting
laugh
.
               
<EOS>
Ho

the

and
the
herd

To

stirr'd

<EOS>
And
the
rugged
limestone
quarry
,
           
<EOS>
Where
'
twas
digg'd
may
no
more
tarry
;
           
While
the
goblin
haunted
dingle
,
           
<EOS>
With
another
dell
must
mingle
.
           
<EOS>
Pendle
Moor
is
in
commotion
,
           
Like
the
billows
of
the
ocean

When

In

Without

<EOS>
Now

<EOS>
How

burrowing

The

Winds

differently,--the

The

<EOS>
Lies
on

nigh
the

The

fenced

Wcll

stock'd
with

a

hath
flown

The

gone

Through

new
the

rushes

Its

course
conceal'd
by
bushes

<EOS>
Where

a

Rises

Doubting

After
a

pause
the
voice
added
,
           
"
I

replied
Mistress

whose

gleamed
with
fierce
exultation

<EOS>
"
Bring

<EOS>
she
shouted

<EOS>
And
at
the
words
,
her
swarthy
serving
-
man
,
Blackadder
,
came
forth
from
the
Lacy
chapel
,
leading
Jennet
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
Tib
,
who
,
dilated
to
twice
his
former
size
,
walked
with
tail
erect
,
and
eyes
glowing
like
carbuncles
.
 
<EOS>
At
sight
of
her
daughter
a
loud
cry
of
rage
and
astonishment
burst
from
Elizabeth
Device
,
and
,
rushing
forward
,
she
would
have
seized
her
,
if
Tib
had
not
kept
her
off
by
a
formidable
display
of
teeth
and
talons
.
<EOS>
Jennet
made
no
effort
to
join
her
mother
,
but
regarded
her
with
a
malicious
and
triumphant
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
chilt
,
"
screamed
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
canna

baptised
without

<EOS>
Ey

<EOS>
"
Ey

replied
Jennet
,
with
affected
simplicity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then

,
and

,
"
rejoined
Elizabeth
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay

"
replied
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ey'd

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ho

"
laughed
the
voice
from
below
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nah

"
shrieked
Elizabeth
,
"

<EOS>
Whoy

<EOS>

she
added
to
Mistress
Nutter
.
"
<EOS>
Yo

<EOS>
Boh

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
consent
is
not
required
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
waving
her
off
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
daughter
is
anxious
to
become
a
witch
.
<EOS>
That
is
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
owd
enough
to
act
for

,
"
said
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Age

,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
mun
<EOS>
ey
do
to
become
a
witch
?
"
asked
Jennet
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
renounce
all
hopes
of
heaven
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
devote
yourself
to
Satan
.
<EOS>
You
will
then
be
baptised
in
his
name
,
and
become
one
of
his
worshippers
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
power
to
afflict
all
persons
with
bodily
ailments
--
to
destroy
cattle
--
blight
corn
--
<EOS>
burn
dwellings
--
and
,
if
you
be
so
minded
,
kill
those
you
hate
,
or
who
molest
you
.
<EOS>
Do
you
desire
to
do
all
this
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Eigh
,
that
ey
do
,
"
replied
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ey

more
pleasure
in

an

<EOS>
"
All
this
you
shall
do
,
and
more
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
You
renounce
all
hopes
of

to
the
Powers
of
Darkness

"
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
who
was
still
kept
at
bay
by
Tib
,
shaking
her
arms
,
and
gnashing
her
teeth
,
in
impotent
rage
,
now
groaned
aloud
;
but
ere
Jennet
could
answer
,
a
piercing
cry
was
heard
,
which
thrilled
through
Mistress
Nutter
's
bosom
,
and
Alizon
,
rushing
from
her
place
of
concealment
,
passed
through
the
weird
circle
,
and
stood
beside
the
group
in
the
midst
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forbear
,
Jennet
,
"
she
cried
;
"
forbear
!
<EOS>
Pronounce
not
those
impious
words
,
or
<EOS>
you
are
lost
for
ever

Come

I

<EOS>
"
Sister
Alizon
,
"
cried
Jennet
,
staring
at
her
in
surprise
<EOS>
,
"
what
makes
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
ask
--
but
come
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
trying
to
take
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
what
is
this
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
now
partly
recovered
from
the
consternation
and
astonishment
into
which
she
had
been
thrown
by
Alizon
's
unexpected
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
here
?
<EOS>
How
have
you
broken
the
chains
of
slumber
in
which
I
bound
you

Fly

--
at

this

<EOS>
You

She

<EOS>
Fly

I

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ho

<EOS>
"
laughed
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
hear
that
laughter
?
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
a
haggard
look
.
"
<EOS>
Go
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
without
Jennet

"
replied
Alizon
,
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
child
--
my
child
--
on
my
knees
I
implore
you
to
depart

cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
throwing
herself
before
her--"You
know
not
your
danger
--
<EOS>
oh
,
fly
--
fly
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
Alizon
continued
inflexible
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo

caught

i

your

cried
Elizabeth
Device
,
with
a
taunting
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sin

Your

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Curses
upon
thy
malice
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
be
done
in
this
extremity
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"
Jennet
is
mine
already
.
<EOS>
If
not
brought
hither
by
thee
,
or
by
her
mother
,
she
would
have
come
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
I
have
watched
her
,
and
marked
her
for
my
own
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
is
fated
.
<EOS>
The
curse
of
Paslew
clings
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
words
were
uttered
,
the
shade
of
the
abbot
glided
forwards
,
and
,
touching
the
shuddering
child
upon
the
brow
with
its
finger
,
vanished
with
a
lamentable
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Kneel
,
Jennet
,
"
cried
Alizon
;
"
kneel
,
and
pray
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
me
,
"
rejoined
the
voice
;
"
she
can
bend
to
no
other
power
.
<EOS>
Alice
Nutter
,
thou
hast
sought
to
deceive
me
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
I
bade
<EOS>
thee
bring
thy
daughter
here
,
and
in
place
of
her
thou
offerest
me
<EOS>
the
child
of
another
,
who
is
mine
already
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
to
be
thus
trifled
with
.
<EOS>
Thou
knowest
my
will
.
<EOS>
Sprinkle
water
over
her
head
,
and
devote
her
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
would
fain
have
thrown
herself
on
her
knees
,
but
extremity
of
horror
,
or
some
overmastering
influence
,
held
her
fast
;
and
she
remained
with
her
gaze
fixed
upon
her
mother
,
who
seemed
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
no
way
to
avoid
this
?
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
way
but
one
,
"
replied
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
offered
a
new
devotee
,
and
I
claim
fulfilment
of
the
promise
.
<EOS>
Thy
daughter
or
another
,
it
matters
not
--
but
not
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
embrace
the
alternative
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
done
upon
the
instant
,
"
said
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
And
,
stretching
her
arm
in
the
direction
of
the
mansion
,
she
called
in
a
loud
imperious
voice
,
"
<EOS>
Dorothy
Assheton
,
come
hither
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
minute
elapsed
,
but
no
one
appeared
,
and
,
with
a
look
of
disappointment
,
Mistress
Nutter
repeated
the
gesture
and
the
words
.
 
<EOS>
Still
no
one
came
.
 
<EOS>
"
Baffled
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
"
what
can
it
mean
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
maiden
within
the
south
transept
,
who
is
not
one
of
my
servants
,
"
cried
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Call
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
she
!
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
stretching
her
arm
towards
the
transept
.
<EOS>
"
This
time
I
am
answered
,
"
she
added
,
as
with
a
wild
laugh
Dorothy
obeyed
the
summons
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
anointed
myself
with
the
unguent
,
and
drank
of
the
potion
,
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dorothy
,
with
a
wild
gesture
,
and
wilder
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
this
accounts
for
her
presence
here
,
"
muttered
Mistress
Nutter
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
could
not
be
better
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
no
mood
to
offer
resistance
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
,
thou
shalt
be
a
witch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
witch
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
bewildered
maiden
.
"
<EOS>
Is
Alizon
a
witch
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
witches
here
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
had
no
power
to
contradict
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
merry
company
!
"
exclaimed
Dorothy
,
laughing
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
say
so
anon
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
waving
her
hand
over
her
,
and
muttering
a
spell
;
"
but
you
see
them
not
in
their
true
forms
,
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
Look
again
--
what
do
you
behold
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
place
of
a
troop
of
old
wrinkled
crones
in
wretched
habiliments
,
"
replied
Dorothy
,
"
I
behold
a
band
of
lovely
nymphs
in
light
gauzy
attire
,
wreathed
with
flowers
,
and
holding
myrtle
and
olive
branches
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
See
they
rise
,
and
prepare
for
the
dance
.
<EOS>
Strains
of
ravishing
music
salute
the
ear
.
<EOS>
I
never
heard
sounds
so
sweet
and
stirring
.
<EOS>
The
round
is
formed
.
<EOS>
The
dance
begins
.
<EOS>
How
gracefully
--
how
lightly
they
move
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
could
not
check
her
--
could
not
undeceive
her
--
for
power
of
speech
as
of
movement
was
denied
her
,
but
she
comprehended
the
strange
delusion
under
which
the
poor
girl
laboured
.
<EOS>
The
figures
Dorothy
described
as
young
and
lovely
,
were
still
to
her
the
same
loathsome
and
abhorrent
witches
;
the
ravishing
music
jarred
discordantly
on
her
ear
,
as
if
produced
by
a
shrill
cornemuse
;
and
the
lightsome
dance
was
a
fantastic
round
,
performed
with
shouts
and
laughter
by
the
whole
unhallowed
crew
.
 
<EOS>
Jennet
laughed
immoderately
,
and
seemed
delighted
by
the
antics
of
the
troop
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
never
wished
to
dance
efore
,
"
she
cried
,
"
boh
ey
should
like
to
try
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Join
them
,
then
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
the
little
girl
's
infinite
delight
a
place
was
made
for
her
in
the
round
,
and
,
taking
hands
with
Mother
Mould
-
heels
and
the
red
-
haired
witch
,
she
footed
it
as
merrily
as
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
she
in
the
nunlike
habit
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Dorothy
,
pointing
to
the
shade
of
Isole
de
Heton
,
which
still
hovered
near
the
weird
assemblage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
seems
more
beautiful
than
all
the
others
.
<EOS>
Will
she
not
dance
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
her
not
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothy
,
however
,
would
not
be
gainsaid
,
but
,
spite
of
the
caution
,
beckoned
the
figure
towards
her
.
<EOS>
It
came
at
once
,
and
in
another
instant
its
arms
were
enlaced
around
her
.
<EOS>
The
same
frenzy
that
had
seized
Nicholas
now
took
possession
of
Dorothy
,
and
her
dance
with
Isole
might
have
come
to
a
similar
conclusion
,
if
it
had
not
been
abruptly
checked
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
,
waving
her
hand
,
and
pronouncing
a
spell
,
the
figure
instantly
quitted
Dorothy
,
and
,
with
a
wild
shriek
,
fled
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
like
you
these
diversions
?
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
to
the
panting
and
almost
breathless
maiden
.
 
<EOS>
"
Marvellously
,
"
replied
Dorothy
;
"
but
why
have
you
scared
my
partner
away
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
she
would
have
done
you
a
mischief
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
"
<EOS>
But
now
let
me
put
a
question
to
you
.
<EOS>
Are
you
willing
to
renounce
your
baptism
,
and
enter
into
a
covenant
with
the
Prince
of
Darkness
?
"
 
<EOS>
Dorothy
did
not
seem
in
the
least
to
comprehend
what
was
said
to
her
;
but
she
nevertheless
replied
,
"
I
am
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
water
and
salt
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
to
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
By
these
drops
I
baptise
you
,
"
she
added
,
dipping
her
fingers
in
the
liquid
,
and
preparing
to
sprinkle
it
over
the
brow
of
the
proselyte
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
Alizon
,
by
an
almost
superhuman
effort
,
burst
the
spell
that
bound
her
,
and
clasped
Dorothy
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
not
what
you
do
,
dear
Dorothy
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
answer
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
yield
to
the
snares
and
temptations
of
Satan
,
however
subtly
devised
.
<EOS>
You
defy
him
and
all
his
works
.
<EOS>
You
will
make
no
covenant
with
him
.
<EOS>
Though
surrounded
by
his
bond
-
slaves
,
you
fear
him
not
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
Dorothy
could
only
answer
with
an
insane
laugh--"I
<EOS>
will
be
a
witch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
,
"
interposed
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
save
her
.
<EOS>
And
,
remember
!
<EOS>
she
stands
in
your
place
.
<EOS>
Or
you
or
she
must
be
devoted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
desert
her
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
twining
her
arms
round
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dorothy
--
dear
Dorothy
--
address
yourself
to
Heaven
.
"
 
<EOS>
An
angry
growl
of
thunder
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beware
!
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
to
be
discouraged
,
"
rejoined
Alizon
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
gain
a
victory
over
a
soul
in
this
condition
,
and
I
shall
effect
her
deliverance
.
<EOS>
Heaven
will
aid
us
,
Dorothy
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
louder
roll
of
thunder
was
heard
,
followed
by
a
forked
flash
of
lightning
.
 
<EOS>
"
Provoke
not
the
vengeance
of
the
Prince
of
Darkness
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fear
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Cling
to
me
,
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
No
harm
shall
befall
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
speedy
!
"
cried
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
her
go
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
to
Alizon
,
"
or
you
will
rue
this
disobedience
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
interfere
with
my
projects
,
and
bring
ruin
on
yourself
!
<EOS>
I
would
save
you
.
<EOS>
What
,
still
obstinate
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
then
,
I
will
no
longer
show
forbearance
.
<EOS>
Help
me
,
sisters
.
<EOS>
Force
the
new
witch
from
her
.
<EOS>
But
beware
how
you
harm
my
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
these
words
the
troop
gathered
round
the
two
girls
.
<EOS>
But
Alizon
only
clasped
her
hands
more
tightly
round
Dorothy
;
while
the
latter
,
on
whose
brain
the
maddening
potion
still
worked
,
laughed
frantically
at
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
moment
that
Elizabeth
Device
,
who
had
conceived
a
project
of
revenge
,
put
it
into
execution
.
<EOS>
While
near
Dorothy
,
she
stamped
,
spat
on
the
ground
,
and
then
cast
a
little
mould
over
her
,
breathing
in
her
ear
,
"
Thou
art
bewitched
--
bewitched
by
Alizon
Device
.
"
 
<EOS>
Dorothy
instantly
struggled
to
free
herself
from
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
not
you
strive
against
me
,
dear
Dorothy
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Remain
with
me
,
or
you
are
lost
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hence
!
off
!
<EOS>
set
me
free
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Dorothy
;
"
you
have
bewitched
me
.
<EOS>
I
heard
it
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
believe
the
false
suggestion
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
exclaimed
all
the
other
witches
together
.
"
<EOS>
Alizon
has
bewitched
you
,
and
will
kill
you
.
<EOS>
Shake
her
off
--
shake
her
off
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Away
!
"
cried
Dorothy
,
mustering
all
her
force
.
"
<EOS>
Away
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
Alizon
was
still
too
strong
for
her
,
and
,
in
spite
of
her
efforts
at
liberation
,
detained
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
patience
is
wellnigh
exhausted
,
"
exclaimed
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
!
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
imploringly
.
 
<EOS>
And
again
the
witches
gathered
<EOS>
furiously
round
the
two
girls
.
 
<EOS>
"
Kneel
,
Dorothy
,
kneel
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Alizon
.
<EOS>
And
forcing
her
down
,
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
her
,
exclaiming
,
with
uplifted
hands
,
"
Gracious
heaven
!
<EOS>
deliver
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
fearful
cry
was
heard
,
and
the
weird
troop
fled
away
screaming
,
like
ill
-
omened
birds
.
<EOS>
The
caldron
sank
into
the
ground
;
the
dense
mist
arose
like
a
curtain
;
and
the
moon
and
stars
shone
brightly
down
upon
the
ruined
pile
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
prayed
long
and
fervently
,
with
clasped
hands
and
closed
eyes
,
for
deliverance
from
evil
.
<EOS>
When
she
looked
round
again
,
all
was
so
calm
,
so
beautiful
,
so
holy
in
its
rest
,
that
she
could
scarcely
believe
in
the
recent
fearful
occurrences
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
and
garments
were
damp
with
the
dews
of
night
;
and
at
her
feet
lay
Dorothy
,
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
She
tried
to
raise
her
--
to
revive
her
,
but
in
vain
;
when
at
this
moment
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
,
and
the
next
moment
Mistress
Nutter
,
accompanied
by
Adam
Whitworth
and
some
other
serving
-
men
,
entered
the
choir
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
them
--
they
are
here
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
lady
,
rushing
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
you
have
found
them
,
madam
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
old
steward
,
coming
quickly
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
what
an
alarm
you
have
given
me
,
Alizon
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
What
could
induce
you
to
go
forth
secretly
at
night
in
this
way
with
Dorothy
!
<EOS>
I
dreamed
you
were
here
,
and
missing
you
when
I
awoke
,
roused
the
house
and
came
in
search
of
you
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
with
Dorothy
?
<EOS>
She
has
been
frightened
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
her
to
breathe
at
this
phial
.
<EOS>
It
will
revive
her
.
<EOS>
See
,
she
opens
her
eyes
.
"
 
<EOS>
Dorothy
looked
round
wildly
for
a
moment
,
and
then
pointing
her
finger
at
Alizon
,
said--
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
bewitched
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
she
rambles
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
to
Adam
Whitworth
,
who
,
with
the
other
serving
-
men
,
stared
aghast
at
the
accusation
;
"
she
has
been
scared
out
of
her
senses
by
some
fearful
sight
.
<EOS>
Let
her
be
conveyed
quickly
to
my
chamber
,
and
I
will
see
her
cared
for
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
orders
were
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
was
raised
gently
by
the
serving
-
men
,
but
she
still
kept
pointing
to
Alizon
,
and
repeatedly
exclaimed--
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
bewitched
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
serving
-
men
shook
their
heads
,
and
looked
significantly
at
each
other
,
while
Mistress
Nutter
lingered
to
speak
to
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
look
greatly
disturbed
,
Alizon
,
as
if
you
had
been
visited
by
a
nightmare
in
your
sleep
,
and
were
still
under
its
influence
.
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
made
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
few
hours
'
tranquil
sleep
will
restore
you
,
"
pursued
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
you
will
forget
your
fears
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
indulge
in
these
nocturnal
rambles
again
,
or
they
may
be
attended
with
dangerous
consequences
.
<EOS>
I
may
not
have
a
second
warning
dream
.
<EOS>
Come
to
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
Alizon
followed
her
along
the
garden
path
,
she
could
not
help
asking
herself
,
though
with
little
hope
in
the
question
,
if
all
she
had
witnessed
was
indeed
nothing
more
than
a
troubled
dream
.

CHAPTER
I.--FLINT
.
  
<EOS>
A
lovely
morning
succeeded
the
strange
and
terrible
night
.
<EOS>
Brightly
shone
the
sun
upon
the
fair
Calder
as
it
winded
along
the
green
meads
above
the
bridge
,
as
it
rushed
rejoicingly
over
the
weir
,
and
pursued
its
rapid
course
through
the
broad
plain
below
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
A
few
white
vapours
hung
upon
the
summit
of
Whalley
Nab
,
but
the
warm
rays
tinging
them
with
gold
,
and
tipping
with
fire
the
tree
-
tops
that
pierced
through
them
,
augured
their
speedy
dispersion
.
<EOS>
So
beautiful
,
so
tranquil
,
looked
the
old
monastic
fane
,
that
none
would
have
deemed
its
midnight
rest
had
been
broken
by
the
impious
rites
of
a
foul
troop
.
<EOS>
The
choir
,
where
the
unearthly
scream
and
the
demon
laughter
had
resounded
,
was
now
vocal
with
the
melodies
of
the
blackbird
,
the
thrush
,
and
other
songsters
of
the
grove
.
<EOS>
Bells
of
dew
glittered
upon
the
bushes
rooted
in
the
walls
,
and
upon
the
ivy
-
grown
pillars
;
and
gemming
the
countless
spiders
'
webs
stretched
from
bough
to
bough
,
showed
they
were
all
unbroken
.
<EOS>
No
traces
were
visible
on
the
sod
where
the
unhallowed
crew
had
danced
their
round
;
nor
were
any
ashes
left
where
the
fire
had
burnt
and
the
caldron
had
bubbled
.
<EOS>
The
brass
-
covered
tombs
of
the
abbots
in
the
presbytery
looked
as
if
a
century
had
passed
over
them
without
disturbance
;
while
the
graves
in
the
cloister
cemetery
,
obliterated
,
and
only
to
be
detected
when
a
broken
coffin
or
a
mouldering
bone
was
turned
up
by
the
tiller
of
the
ground
,
preserved
their
wonted
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
face
of
nature
had
received
neither
impress
nor
injury
from
the
fantastic
freaks
and
necromantic
exhibitions
of
the
witches
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
looked
as
it
was
left
overnight
;
and
the
only
footprints
to
be
detected
were
those
of
the
two
girls
,
and
of
the
party
who
came
in
quest
of
them
.
<EOS>
All
else
had
passed
by
like
a
vision
or
a
dream
.
<EOS>
The
rooks
cawed
loudly
in
the
neighbouring
trees
,
as
if
discussing
the
question
of
breakfast
,
and
the
jackdaws
wheeled
merrily
round
the
tall
spire
,
which
sprang
from
the
eastern
end
of
the
fane
.
 
<EOS>
Brightly
shone
the
sun
upon
the
noble
timber
embowering
the
mansion
of
the
Asshetons
;
upon
the
ancient
gateway
,
in
the
upper
chamber
of
which
<EOS>
Ned
Huddlestone
,
the
porter
,
and
the
burly
representative
of
Friar
Tuck
,
was
rubbing
his
sleepy
eyes
,
preparatory
to
habiting
himself
in
his
ordinary
attire
;
and
upon
the
wide
court
-
yard
,
across
which
Nicholas
was
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
stables
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
excesses
overnight
,
the
squire
was
astir
,
as
he
had
declared
he
should
be
,
before
daybreak
;
and
a
plunge
into
the
Calder
had
cooled
his
feverish
limbs
and
cured
his
racking
headache
,
while
a
draught
of
ale
set
his
stomach
right
.
<EOS>
Still
,
in
modern
parlance
,
he
looked
rather
"
seedy
,
"
and
his
recollection
of
the
events
of
the
previous
night
was
somewhat
confused
.
<EOS>
Aware
he
had
committed
many
fooleries
,
he
did
not
desire
to
investigate
matters
too
closely
,
and
only
hoped
he
should
not
be
reminded
of
them
by
Sir
Ralph
,
or
worse
still
,
by
Parson
Dewhurst
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
poor
,
dear
,
uncomplaining
wife
,
he
never
once
troubled
his
head
about
her
,
feeling
quite
sure
she
would
not
upbraid
him
.
<EOS>
On
his
appearance
in
the
court
-
yard
,
the
two
noble
blood
-
hounds
and
several
lesser
dogs
came
forward
to
greet
him
,
and
,
attended
by
this
noisy
pack
,
he
marched
up
to
a
groom
,
who
was
rubbing
down
his
horse
at
the
stable
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Robin
,
"
he
cried
to
the
steed
,
who
neighed
at
his
approach
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Robin
,
"
he
said
,
patting
his
neck
affectionately
,
"
there
is
not
thy
match
for
speed
or
endurance
,
for
fence
or
ditch
,
for
beck
or
stone
wall
,
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
on
thy
back
will
make
all
right
with
me
;
but
I
would
rather
take
thee
to
Bowland
Forest
,
and
hunt
the
stag
there
,
than
go
and
perambulate
the
boundaries
of
the
Rough
Lee
estates
with
a
rascally
attorney
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
the
fellow
will
be
mounted
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
yo
be
speering
about
Mester
Potts
,
squoire
,
"
observed
the
groom
,
"
ey
<EOS>
con
tell
ye
.
<EOS>
He
's
to
ha
'
little
Flint
,
the
Welsh
pony
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
zounds
,
you
do
n't
say
,
Peter
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Nicholas
,
laughing
;
"
he
'll
never
be
able
to
manage
him
.
<EOS>
Flint
's
the
wickedest
and
most
wilful
little
brute
<EOS>
I
ever
knew
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
Master
Potts
run
away
with
,
or
thrown
into
a
moss
-
pit
.
<EOS>
Better
give
him
something
quieter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
Sir
Roaph
's
orders
,
"
replied
Peter
,
"
<EOS>
an
ey
darna
disobey
'em
.
<EOS>
Boh
Flint
's
far
steadier
than
when
yo
seed
him
last
,
squoire
.
<EOS>
Ey
dar
say
he
'll
carry
Mester
Potts
<EOS>
weel
enough
,
if
he
dusna
mislest
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
nothing
of
the
sort
,
Peter
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
You
expect
to
see
the
little
gentleman
fly
over
the
pony
's
head
,
and
perhaps
break
his
own
at
starting
.
<EOS>
But
if
Sir
Ralph
has
ordered
it
,
he
must
abide
by
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
interfere
further
.
<EOS>
How
goes
on
the
young
colt
you
were
breaking
in
?
<EOS>
You
should
take
care
to
show
him
the
saddle
in
the
manger
,
let
him
smell
it
,
and
jingle
the
stirrups
in
his
ears
,
before
you
put
it
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
Better
ground
for
his
first
lessons
could
not
be
desired
than
the
field
below
the
grange
,
near
the
Calder
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
was
saying
yesterday
,
that
the
roan
mare
had
pricked
her
foot
.
<EOS>
You
must
wash
the
sore
well
with
white
wine
and
salt
,
rub
it
with
the
ointment
the
farriers
call
ægyptiacum
,
and
then
put
upon
it
a
hot
plaster
compounded
of
flax
hards
,
turpentine
,
oil
and
wax
,
bathing
the
top
of
the
hoof
with
bole
armeniac
and
vinegar
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
best
and
quickest
remedy
.
<EOS>
And
recollect
,
Peter
,
that
for
a
new
strain
,
vinegar
,
bole
armeniac
,
whites
of
eggs
,
and
bean
-
flour
,
make
the
best
salve
.
<EOS>
How
goes
on
Sir
Ralph
's
black
charger
,
Dragon
?
<EOS>
A
brave
horse
that
,
Peter
,
and
the
only
one
in
your
master
's
whole
stud
to
compare
with
my
Robin
!
<EOS>
But
Dragon
,
though
of
high
courage
and
great
swiftness
,
has
not
the
strength
and
endurance
of
Robin
--
neither
can
he
leap
so
well
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Robin
would
almost
clear
the
Calder
,
Peter
,
and
makes
nothing
of
Smithies
Brook
,
near
Downham
,

you
know
how
wide
that
stream

<EOS>
I
once
tried
him
at
the
Ribble
,
at
a
narrow
point
,
and
if
horse
could
have
done
it
,
he
would
--
<EOS>
but
it
was
too
much
to
expect
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
,
ey
should
say
,
squoire
,
"
replied
the
groom
,
opening
his
eyes
to
their
widest
extent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whoy

th
'
Ribble
,
where

it

and
no

onless

<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
n't
allude
to
witches
,
Peter
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
had
enough
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
to
come
back
to
our
steeds
.
<EOS>
Colour
is
matter
of
taste
,
and
a
man
must
please
his
own
eye
with
bay
or
grey
,
chestnut
,
sorrel
,
or
black
;
but
dun
is
my
fancy
.
<EOS>
A
good
horse
,
Peter
,
should
be
clean
-
limbed
,
short
-
jointed
,
strong
-
hoofed
,
out
-
ribbed
,
broad
-
chested
,
deep
-
necked
,
loose
-
throttled
,
thin
-
crested
,
lean
-
headed
,
full
-
eyed
,
with
wide
nostrils
.
<EOS>
A
horse
with
half
these
points
would
not
be
wrong
,
and
Robin
has
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So

"
replied
Peter
,
regarding
the
animal
with
an
approving
eye
,
as
Nicholas
enumerated
his
merits
.
<EOS>
"
Boh

<EOS>
"
Nah

replied
the
groom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

Peter

"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
May

said
the
groom
,
"

returned
Nicholas
,
"
and
they
wo
n't
remain
long
together
,
I
'll
warrant
you
.
<EOS>
I
offered
to
make
a
match
for
twenty
pieces
with
Master
Richard
,
but
he
declined
the
offer
.
<EOS>
Harkee

Peter

break
an

<EOS>
It

and

power
of

<EOS>
You
understand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Parfitly
,
squoire
,
"
replied
the
groom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
"
No

"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
set

in
an
hour
--
or
it
may
be
sooner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aw
shan
be

"
said
Peter
.
<EOS>
And
he
added
to
himself
,
as
Nicholas
moved
away
,
"
Ey'st

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
Nicholas
returned
to
the
house
,
he
perceived
to
his
dismay
Sir
Ralph
and
Parson
Dewhurst
standing
upon
the
steps
;
and
convinced
,
from
their
grave
looks
,
that
they
were
prepared
to
lecture
him
,
he
endeavoured
to
nerve
himself
for
the
infliction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
to
one
are
awkward
odds
,
"
said
the
squire
to
himself
,
"
especially
when
they
have
the
'
vantage
ground
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
face
them
,
and
make
the
best
fight
circumstances
will
allow
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
able
to
explain
that
mad
dance
with
Isole
de
Heton
.
<EOS>
No
one
but
Dick
will
believe
me
,
and
the
chances
are
he
will
not
support
my
story
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
put
on
an
air
of
penitence
,
and
sooth
to
say
,
in
my
present
state
,
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
assume
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
pondering
,
with
slow
step
,
affectedly
humble
demeanour
,
and
surprisingly
-
lengthened
visage
,
he
approached
the
pair
who
were
waiting
for
him
,
and
regarding
him
with
severe
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Thinking
it
the
best
plan
to
open
the
fire
himself
,
Nicholas
saluted
them
,
and
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Give
you
good
-
day
,
Sir
Ralph
,
and
you
too
,
worthy
Master
Dewhurst
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
expected
to
see
you
so
early
astir
,
good
sirs
;
but
the
morning
is
too
beautiful
to
allow
us
to
be
sluggards
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
I
have
been
awake
for
hours
,
and
have
passed
the
time
wholly
in
self
-
reproaches
for
my
folly
and
sinfulness
last
night
,
as
well
as
in
forming
resolutions
for
self
-
amendment
,
and
better
governance
in
future
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
adhere
to
those
resolutions
,
then
,
Nicholas
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Ralph
,
sternly
;
"
for
change
of
conduct
is
absolutely
necessary
,
if
you
would
maintain
your
character
as
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
allowance
for
high
animal
spirits
,
and
can
excuse
some
licence
,
though
I
do
not
approve
of
it
;
But
I
will
not
permit
decorum
to
be
outraged
in
my
house
,
and
suffer
so
ill
an
example
to
be
set
to
my
tenantry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fortunately
I
was
not
present
at
the
exhibition
,
"
said
Dewhurst
;
"
but
I
am
told
you
conducted
yourself
like
one
possessed
,
and
committed
such
freaks
as
are
rarely
,
if
ever
,
acted
by
a
rational
being
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
offer
no
defence
,
worthy
sir
,
and
you
my
respected
relative
,
"
returned
Nicholas
,
with
a
contrite
air
;
"
neither
can
you
reprove
me
more
strongly
than
I
deserve
,
nor
than
I
upbraid
myself
.
<EOS>
I
allowed
myself
to
be
overcome
by
wine
,
and
in
that
condition
was
undoubtedly
guilty
of
follies
I
must
ever
regret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amongst
others
,
I
believe
you
stood
upon
your
head
,
"
remarked
Dewhurst
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
aware
of
the
circumstance
,
reverend
sir
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
with
difficulty
repressing
a
smile
;
"
but
as
I
certainly
lost
my
head
,
I
may
have
stood
upon
it
unconsciously
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
recollect
enough
to
make
me
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
,
and
determine
to
avoid
all
such
excesses
in
future
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Dewhurst
,
"
the
occurrences
of
last
night
,
though
sufficiently
discreditable
to
you
,
will
not
be
without
profit
;
for
I
have
observed
to
my
infinite
regret
,
that
you
are
apt
to
indulge
in
immoderate
potations
,
and
when
under
their
influence
to
lose
due
command
of
yourself
,
and
commit
follies
which
your
sober
reason
must
condemn
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
I
scarcely
recognise
you
.
<EOS>
You
speak
with
unbecoming
levity
,
and
even
allow
oaths
to
escape
your
lips
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
true
,
reverend
sir
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
"
but
,
zounds!--a
plague
upon
my
tongue
--
it
is
an
unruly
member
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
good
sir
,
but
my
brain
is
a
little
confused
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
,
from
the
grievous
assaults
made
upon
it
last
night
,
Nicholas
,
"
observed
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
your
crowning
act
was
whisking
wildly
round
the
room
by
yourself
,
like
a
frantic
dervish
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
dancing
with
Isole
de
Heton
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
whom
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Dewhurst
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
a
wicked
votaress
,
who
has
been
dead
nearly
a
couple
of
centuries
,
"
interposed
Sir
Ralph
;
"
and
who
,
by
her
sinful
life
,
merited
the
punishment
she
is
said
to
have
incurred
.
<EOS>
This
delusion
shows
how
dreadfully
intoxicated
you
were
,
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
For
the
time
you
had
quite
lost
your
reason
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sober
enough
now
,
at
all
events
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
and
I
am
convinced
that
Isole
did
dance
with
me
,
nor
will
any
arguments
reason
me
out
of
that
belief
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
,
Nicholas
,
"
returned
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"
That
you
were
under
the
impression
at
the
time
I
can
easily
understand
;
but
that
you
should
persist
in
such
a
senseless
and
wicked
notion
is
more
than
I
can
comprehend
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
her
with
my
own
eyes
as
plainly
as
I
see
you
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
warmly
;
"
that
I
declare
upon
my
honour
and
conscience
,
and
I
also
felt
the
pressure
of
her
arms
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
may
not
have
been
the
Fiend
in
her
likeness
<EOS>
I
will
not
take
upon
me
to
declare
--
and
indeed
I
have
some
misgivings
on
the
subject
;
but
that
a
beautiful
creature
,
exactly
resembling
the
votaress
,
danced
with
me
,
I
will
ever
maintain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
she
was
invisible
to
others
,
for
I
beheld
her
not
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
;
"
and
,
though
I
can
not
yield
credence
to
your
explanation
,
yet
,
granting
it
to
be
correct
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
see
how
it
mends
your
case
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
it
only
proves
that
Master
Nicholas
yielded
to
the
snares
of
Satan
,
"
said
Dewhurst
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
recommend
you
long
fasting
and
frequent
prayer
,
my
good
sir
,
and
I
shall
prepare
a
lecture
for
your
special
edification
,
which
I
will
propound
to
you
on
your
return
to
Downham
,
and
,
if
it
fails
in
effect
,
I
will
persevere
with
other
godly
discourses
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
your
aid
,
I
trust
to
be
set
free
,
reverend
sir
,
"
returned
Nicholas
;
"
but
,
as
I
have
already
passed
two
or
three
hours
in
prayer
<EOS>
,
I
hope
they
may
stand
me
in
lieu
of
any
present
fasting
,
and
induce
you
to
omit
the
article
of
penance
,
or
postpone
it
to
some
future
occasion
,
when
I
may
be
better
able
to
perform
it
;
for
I
am
just
now
particularly
hungry
,
and
am
always
better
able
to
resist
temptation
with
a
full
stomach
than
an
empty
one
.
<EOS>
As
I
find
it
displeasing
to
Sir
Ralph
,
I
will
not
insist
upon
my
visionary
partner
in
the
dance
,
at
least
until
I
am
better
able
to
substantiate
the
fact
;
and
I
shall
listen
to
your
lectures
,
worthy
sir
,
with
great
delight
,
and
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
with
equal
benefit
;
but
in
the
meantime
,
as
carnal
wants
must
be
supplied
,
and
mundane
matters
attended
to
,
I
propose
,
with
our
excellent
host
's
permission
,
that
we
proceed
to
breakfast
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
made
no
answer
,
but
ascended
the
steps
,
and
was
followed
by
Dewhurst
,
heaving
a
deep
sigh
,
and
turning
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
,
and
by
Nicholas
,
who
felt
his
bosom
eased
of
half
its
load
,
and
secretly
congratulated
himself
upon
getting
out
of
the
scrape
so
easily
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
hall
they
found
Richard
Assheton
habited
in
a
riding
-
dress
,
booted
,
spurred
,
and
in
all
respects
prepared
for
the
expedition
.
<EOS>
There
were
such
evident
traces
of
anxiety
and
suffering
about
him
,
that
Sir
Ralph
questioned
him
as
to
the
cause
,
and
Richard
replied
that
he
had
passed
a
most
restless
night
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
add
,
that
he
had
been
made
acquainted
by
Adam
Whitworth
with
the
midnight
visit
of
the
two
girls
to
the
conventual
church
,
because
he
was
well
aware
Sir
Ralph
would
be
greatly
displeased
by
the
circumstance
,
and
because
Mistress
Nutter
had
expressed
a
wish
that
it
should
be
kept
secret
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
,
however
,
saw
there
was
more
upon
his
young
relative
's
mind
than
he
chose
to
confess
,
but
he
did
not
urge
any
further
admission
into
his
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
party
had
been
increased
by
the
arrival
of
Master
Potts
,
who
was
likewise
equipped
for
the
ride
.
<EOS>
The
hour
was
too
early
,
it
might
be
,
for
him
,
or
he
had
not
rested
well
like
Richard
,
or
had
been
troubled
with
bad
dreams
,
but
certainly
he
did
not
look
very
well
,
or
in
very
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
He
had
slept
at
the
Abbey
,
having
been
accommodated
with
a
bed
after
the
sudden
seizure
which
he
attributed
to
the
instrumentality
of
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
The
little
attorney
bowed
obsequiously
to
Sir
Ralph
,
who
returned
his
salutation
very
stiffly
,
nor
was
he
much
better
received
by
the
rest
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
At
a
sign
from
Sir
Ralph
,
his
guests
then
knelt
down
,
and
a
prayer
was
uttered
by
the
divine
--
or
rather
a
discourse
,
for
it
partook
more
of
the
latter
character
than
the
former
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
it
he
took
occasion
to
paint
in
strong
colours
the
terrible
consequences
of
intemperance
,
and
Nicholas
was
obliged
to
endure
a
well
-
merited
lecture
of
half
an
hour
's
duration
.
<EOS>
But
even
Parson
Dewhurst
could
not
hold
out
for
ever
,
and
,
to
the
relief
of
all
his
hearers
,
he
at
length
brought
this
discourse
to
a
close
.
 
<EOS>
Breakfast
at
this
period
was
a
much
more
substantial
affair
than
a
modern
morning
repast
,
and
differed
little
from
dinner
or
supper
,
except
in
respect
to
quantity
.
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
,
there
were
carbonadoes
of
fish
and
fowl
,
a
cold
chine
,
a
huge
pasty
,
a
capon
,
neat
's
tongues
,
sausages
,
botargos
,
and
other
matters
as
provocative
of
thirst
as
sufficing
to
the
appetite
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
set
to
work
bravely
.
<EOS>
Broiled
trout
,
steaks
,
and
a
huge
slice
of
venison
pasty
,
disappeared
quickly
before
him
,
and
he
was
not
quite
so
sparing
of
the
ale
as
seemed
consistent
with
his
previously
-
expressed
resolutions
of
temperance
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Parson
Dewhurst
filled
a
goblet
with
water
,
and
looked
significantly
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
take
the
hint
,
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
admonitory
cough
of
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
He
had
little
help
from
the
others
,
for
Richard
ate
sparingly
,
and
Master
Potts
made
a
very
poor
figure
beside
him
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
having
cleared
his
plate
,
emptied
his
cup
,
and
wiped
his
lips
,
the
squire
arose
,
and
said
he
must
bid
adieu
to
his
wife
,
and
should
then
be
ready
to
attend
them
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
quitted
the
hall
for
this
purpose
,
Mistress
Nutter
entered
it
.
<EOS>
She
looked
paler
than
ever
,
and
her
eyes
seemed
larger
,
darker
,
and
brighter
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
shuddered
slightly
as
she
approached
,
and
even
Potts
felt
a
thrill
of
apprehension
pass
through
his
frame
.
<EOS>
He
scarcely
,
indeed
,
ventured
a
look
at
her
,
for
he
dreaded
her
mysterious
power
,
and
feared
she
could
fathom
the
designs
he
secretly
entertained
against
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
took
no
notice
whatever
of
him
.
<EOS>
Acknowledging
Sir
Ralph
's
salutation
,
she
motioned
Richard
to
follow
her
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
is
very
ill
,
Richard
,
"
she
said
,
as
the
young
man
attended
her
,
"
feverish
,
and
almost
light
-
headed
.
<EOS>
Adam
Whitworth
has
told
you
,
I
know
,
that
she
was
imprudent
enough
,
in
company
with
Alizon
,
to
visit
the
ruins
of
the
conventual
church
late
last
night
,
and
she
there
sustained
some
fright
,
which
has
produced
a
great
shock
upon
her
system
.
<EOS>
When
found
,
she
was
fainting
,
and
though
I
have
taken
every
care
of
her
,
she
still
continues
much
excited
,
and
rambles
strangely
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
surprised
as
well
as
grieved
when
I
tell
you
,
that
she
charges
Alizon
with
having
bewitched
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
,
madam
!
"
cried
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alizon
bewitch
her
!
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Richard
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
the
thing
is
impossible
;
but
the
accusation
will
find
easy
credence
among
the
superstitious
household
here
,
and
may
be
highly
prejudicial
,
if
not
fatal
to
poor
Alizon
.
<EOS>
It
is
most
unlucky
she
should
have
gone
out
in
this
way
,
for
the
circumstance
can
not
be
explained
,
and
in
itself
serves
to
throw
suspicion
upon
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
Dorothy
before
I
go
,
"
said
Richard
;
"
perhaps
I
may
be
able
to
soothe
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
for
that
end
I
came
hither
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
but
I
thought
it
well
you
should
be
prepared
.
<EOS>
Now
come
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
they
left
the
hall
together
,
and
proceeded
to
the
abbot
's
chamber
,
where
Dorothy
was
lodged
.
<EOS>
Richard
was
greatly
shocked
at
the
sight
of
his
sister
,
so
utterly
changed
was
she
from
the
blithe
being
of
yesterday
--
then
so
full
of
health
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
burnt
with
fever
,
her
eyes
were
unnaturally
bright
,
and
her
fair
hair
hung
about
her
face
in
disorder
.
<EOS>
She
kept
fast
hold
of
Alizon
,
who
stood
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Richard
!
"
she
cried
on
seeing
him
,
"
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
come
.
<EOS>
You
will
persuade
this
girl
to
restore
me
to
reason
--
to
free
me
from
the
terrors
that
beset
me
.
<EOS>
She
can
do
so
if
she
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Calm
yourself
,
dear
sister
,
"
said
Richard
,
gently
endeavouring
to
free
Alizon
from
her
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
do
not
take
her
from
me
,
"
said
Dorothy
,
wildly
;
<EOS>
"
I
am
better
when
she
is
near
me
--
much
better
.
<EOS>
My
brow
does
not
throb
so
violently
,
and
my
limbs
are
not
twisted
so
painfully
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
ails
me
,
Richard
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
caught
cold
from
wandering
out
indiscreetly
last
night
,
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
bewitched
!
"
rejoined
Dorothy
,
in
tones
that
pierced
her
brother
's
brain--"bewitched
by
Alizon
Device
--
by
your
love
--
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
She
wishes
to
kill
me
,
Richard
,
because
she
thinks
I
am
in
her
way
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
not
let
her
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
dear
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
She
means
you
no
harm
,
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
how
much
I
grieve
for
her
,
and
how
fondly
I
love
her
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Alizon
,
tearfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
tell
a
different
tale
when
you
are
gone
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
witch
,
and
you
shall
never
marry
her
,
Richard
--
never!--never
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
,
anxiously
observing
what
was
passing
,
waved
her
hand
several
times
towards
the
sufferer
,
but
without
effect
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
influence
over
her
,
"
she
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
really
bewitched
.
<EOS>
I
must
find
other
means
to
quieten
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Though
both
greatly
distressed
,
Alizon
and
Richard
redoubled
their
attentions
to
the
poor
sufferer
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
she
remained
quiet
,
but
with
her
eyes
constantly
fixed
on
Alizon
,
and
then
said
,
quickly
and
fiercely
,
"
I
have
been
told
,
if
you
scratch
one
who
has
bewitched
you
till
you
draw
blood
,
you
will
be
cured
.
<EOS>
I
will
plunge
my
nails
in
her
flesh
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
oppose
you
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
gently
;
"
tear
my
flesh
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
my
life
's
blood
if
it
would
cure
you
;
but
if
the
success
of
the
experiment
depends
on
my
having
bewitched
you
,
it
will
assuredly
fail
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
dreadful
,
"
interposed
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Leave
her
,
Alizon
,
I
entreat
of
you
.
<EOS>
She
will
do
you
an
injury
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
,
"
replied
the
young
maid
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
stay
by
her
till
she
voluntarily
releases
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
almost
tigress
fury
with
which
Dorothy
had
seized
upon
the
unresisting
girl
here
suddenly
deserted
her
,
and
,
sobbing
hysterically
<EOS>
,
she
fell
upon
her
neck
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
with
what
delight
Alizon
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
!
 
<EOS>
"
Dorothy
,
dear
Dorothy
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
,
dear
Alizon
!
"
responded
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
could
I
suspect
you
of
any
ill
design
against
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
no
witch
,
dear
sister
,
be
assured
of
that
!
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
--
no
--
no
!
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
she
is
not
,
"
cried
Dorothy
,
kissing
her
affectionately
.
 
<EOS>
This
change
had
been
wrought
by
the
low
-
breathed
spells
of
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
access
is
over
,
"
she
mentally
ejaculated
;
"
but
I
must
get
him
away
before
the
fit
returns
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
now
,
Richard
,
"
she
added
aloud
,
and
touching
his
arm
,
"
I
will
answer
for
your
sister
's
restoration
.
<EOS>
An
opiate
will
produce
sleep
,
and
if
possible
,
she
shall
return
to
Middleton
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
go
,
Alizon
must
go
with
me
,
"
said
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
I
will
not
thwart
your
desires
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
And
she
made
a
sign
to
Richard
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
pressed
his
sister
's
hand
,
bade
a
tender
farewell
to
Alizon
,
and
,
infinitely
relieved
by
the
improvement
which
had
taken
place
in
the
former
,
and
which
he
firmly
believed
would
speedily
lead
to
her
entire
restoration
,
<EOS>
descended
to
the
entrance
-
hall
,
where
he
found
Sir
Ralph
and
Parson
Dewhurst
,
who
told
him
that
Nicholas
and
Potts
were
in
the
court
-
yard
,
and
impatient
to
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
Shouts
of
laughter
saluted
the
ears
of
the
trio
as
they
descended
the
steps
.
<EOS>
The
cause
of
the
merriment
was
speedily
explained
when
they
looked
towards
the
stables
,
and
beheld
Potts
struggling
for
mastery
with
a
stout
Welsh
pony
,
who
showed
every
disposition
,
by
plunging
,
kicking
,
and
rearing
,
to
remove
him
from
his
seat
,
though
without
success
,
for
the
attorney
was
not
quite
such
a
contemptible
horseman
as
might
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
A
wicked
-
looking
little
fellow
was
Flint
,
with
a
rough
,
rusty
-
black
coat
,
a
thick
tail
that
swept
the
ground
,
a
mane
to
match
,
and
an
eye
of
mixed
fire
and
cunning
.
<EOS>
When
brought
forth
he
had
allowed
Potts
to
mount
him
quietly
enough
;
but
no
sooner
was
the
attorney
comfortably
in
possession
,
than
he
was
served
with
a
notice
of
ejectment
.
<EOS>
Down
went
Flint
's
head
and
up
went
his
heels
;
while
on
the
next
instant
he
was
rearing
aloft
,
with
his
fore
-
feet
beating
the
air
,
so
nearly
perpendicular
,
that
the
chances
seemed
in
favour
of
his
coming
down
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
Then
he
whirled
suddenly
round
,
shook
himself
violently
,
threatened
to
roll
over
,
and
performed
antics
of
the
most
extraordinary
kind
,
to
the
dismay
of
his
rider
,
but
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
the
spectators
,
who
were
ready
to
split
their
sides
with
laughter
--
indeed
,
tears
fairly
streamed
down
the
squire
's
cheeks
.
<EOS>
However
,
when
Sir
Ralph
appeared
,
it
was
thought
desirable
to
put
an
end
to
the
fun
;
and
Peter
,
the
groom
,
advanced
to
seize
the
restive
little
animal
's
bridle
,
but
,
eluding
the
grasp
,
Flint
started
off
at
full
gallop
,
and
,
accompanied
by
the
two
blood
-
hounds
,
careered
round
the
court
-
yard
,
as
if
running
in
a
ring
.
<EOS>
Vainly
did
poor
Potts
tug
at
the
bridle
.
<EOS>
Flint
,
having
the
bit
firmly
between
his
teeth
,
defied
his
utmost
efforts
.
<EOS>
Away
he
went
with
the
hounds
at
his
heels
,
as
if
,
said
Nicholas
,
"
the
devil
were
behind
him
.
"
<EOS>
Though
annoyed
and
angry
,
Sir
Ralph
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ridiculous
scene
,
and
even
a
smile
crossed
Parson
Dewhurst
's
grave
countenance
as
Flint
and
his
rider
scampered
madly
past
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
called
to
the
grooms
,
and
attempts
were
instantly
made
to
check
the
furious
pony
's
career
;
but
he
baffled
them
all
,
swerving
suddenly
round
when
an
endeavour
was
made
to
intercept
him
,
leaping
over
any
trifling
obstacle
,
and
occasionally
charging
any
one
who
stood
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
What
with
the
grooms
running
hither
and
thither
,
vociferating
and
swearing
,
the
barking
and
springing
of
the
hounds
,
the
yelping
of
lesser
dogs
,
and
the
screaming
of
poultry
,
the
whole
yard
was
in
a
state
of
uproar
and
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Flint
mun
be
possessed
,
"
cried
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
Ey
never
seed
him
go
on
i
'
this
way
efore
.
<EOS>
Ey
noticed
Elizabeth
Device
near
th
'
stables
<EOS>
last
neet
,
an
ey
shouldna
wonder
if
hoo
ha
'
bewitched
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw
doubt
on't
,
"
replied
another
groom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Howsomever
we
mun
contrive
to
ketch
him
,
or
Sir
Roaph
win
send
us
aw
abowt
our
business
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
wish
yo'd
contrive
to
do
it
,
then
,
Tum
Lomax
,
"
replied
Peter
,
"
fo
'
ey'm
fairly
blowd
.
<EOS>
Dang
me
,
if
ey
ever
seed
sich
<EOS>
hey
-
go
<EOS>
-
mad
wark
<EOS>
i
'
my
born
days
.
<EOS>
What
's
to
be
done
,
squoire
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
devil
only
knows
,
"
replied
the
latter
;
"
but
it
seems
we
must
wait
till
the
little
rascal
chooses
to
stop
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
occurred
sooner
than
was
expected
.
<EOS>
Thinking
,
possibly
,
that
he
had
done
enough
to
induce
Master
Potts
to
give
up
all
idea
of
riding
him
,
Flint
suddenly
slackened
his
pace
,
and
trotted
,
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
to
the
stable
-
door
;
but
if
he
had
formed
any
such
notion
as
the
above
,
he
was
deceived
,
for
the
attorney
,
who
was
quite
as
obstinate
and
wilful
as
himself
,
and
who
through
all
his
perils
had
managed
to
maintain
his
seat
,
was
resolved
not
to
abandon
it
,
and
positively
refused
to
dismount
when
urged
to
do
so
by
Nicholas
and
the
grooms
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
go
quietly
enough
now
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
"
observed
Potts
,
"
and
if
not
,
and
you
will
lend
me
a
hunting
-
whip
,
I
will
undertake
to
cure
him
of
his
tricks
.
"
 
<EOS>
Flint
seemed
to
understand
what
was
said
,
for
he
laid
back
his
ears
as
if
meditating
more
mischief
;
but
being
surrounded
by
the
grooms
,
he
deemed
it
advisable
to
postpone
the
attempt
to
a
more
convenient
opportunity
.
<EOS>
In
compliance
with
his
request
,
a
heavy
hunting
-
whip
was
handed
to
Potts
,
and
,
armed
with
this
formidable
weapon
,
the
little
attorney
quite
longed
for
an
opportunity
of
effacing
his
disgrace
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Sir
Ralph
had
come
up
and
ordered
a
steady
horse
out
for
him
;
but
Master
Potts
adhered
to
his
resolution
,
and
Flint
remaining
perfectly
quiet
,
the
baronet
let
him
have
his
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
Nicholas
and
Richard
having
mounted
their
steeds
,
the
party
set
forth
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
passing
through
the
gateway
,
which
had
been
thrown
wide
open
by
Ned
Huddlestone
,
they
were
joined
by
Simon
Sparshot
,
who
had
been
engaged
by
Potts
to
attend
him
on
the
expedition
in
his
capacity
of
constable
.
<EOS>
Simon
was
mounted
on
a
mule
,
and
brought
word
that
Master
Roger
Nowell
begged
they
would
ride
round
by
Read
Hall
,
where
he
would
be
ready
to
accompany
them
,
as
he
wished
to
be
present
at
the
perambulation
of
the
boundaries
.
<EOS>
Assenting
to
the
arrangement
,
the
party
set
forth
in
that
direction
,
Richard
and
Nicholas
riding
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
.

CHAPTER
II.--READ
HALL
.
  
<EOS>
The
road
taken
by
the
party
on
quitting
Whalley
led
up
the
side
of
a
hill
,
which
,
broken
into
picturesque
inequalities
,
and
partially
clothed
with
trees
,
sloped
down
to
the
very
brink
of
the
Calder
.
<EOS>
Winding
round
the
broad
green
plain
,
heretofore
described
,
with
the
lovely
knoll
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
which
formed
,
with
the
woody
hills
encircling
it
,
a
perfect
amphitheatre
,
the
river
was
ever
an
object
of
beauty
--
<EOS>
sometimes
lost
beneath
over
-
hanging
boughs
or
high
banks
,
anon
bursting
forth
where
least
expected
,
now
rushing
swiftly
over
its
shallow
and
rocky
bed
,
now
subsiding
into
a
smooth
full
current
.
<EOS>
The
Abbey
and
the
village
were
screened
from
view
by
the
lower
part
of
the
hill
which
the
horsemen
were
scaling
;
but
the
old
bridge
and
a
few
cottages
at
the
foot
of
Whalley
Nab
,
with
their
thin
blue
smoke
mounting
into
the
pure
morning
air
,
gave
life
and
interest
to
the
picture
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
from
base
to
summit
,
Whalley
Nab
stood
revealed
,
and
the
verdant
lawns
opening
out
amidst
the
woods
feathering
its
heights
,
were
fully
discernible
.
<EOS>
Placed
by
Nature
as
the
guardian
of
this
fair
valley
,
the
lofty
eminence
well
became
the
post
assigned
to
it
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
belt
of
hills
connected
with
it
were
so
well
wooded
as
their
leader
,
nor
so
beautiful
in
form
;
while
some
of
them
were
overtopped
by
the
bleak
fells
of
Longridge
,
rising
at
a
distance
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
were
those
exquisite
contrasts
wanting
,
which
are
only
to
be
seen
in
full
perfection
when
the
day
is
freshest
and
the
dew
is
still
heavy
on
the
grass
.
<EOS>
The
near
side
of
the
hill
was
plunged
in
deep
shade
;
thin
,
gauzy
vapour
hung
on
the
stream
beneath
,
while
on
the
opposite
heights
,
and
where
the
great
boulder
stones
were
visible
in
the
bed
of
the
river
,
all
was
sparkling
with
sunshine
.
<EOS>
So
enchanting
was
the
prospect
,
that
though
perfectly
familiar
with
it
,
the
two
foremost
horsemen
drew
in
the
rein
to
contemplate
it
.
<EOS>
High
above
them
,
on
a
sandbank
,
through
which
their
giant
roots
protruded
,
shot
up
two
tall
silver
-
stemm'd
beech
-
trees
,
forming
with
their
newly
opened
foliage
a
canopy
of
tenderest
green
.
<EOS>
Further
on
appeared
a
grove
of
oaks
scarcely
in
leaf
;
and
below
were
several
fine
sycamores
,
already
green
and
umbrageous
,
intermingled
with
elms
,
ashes
,
and
horse
-
chestnuts
,
and
overshadowing
brakes
,
covered
with
maples
,
alders
,
and
hazels
.
<EOS>
The
other
spaces
among
the
trees
were
enlivened
by
patches
of
yellow
flowering
and
odorous
gorse
.
<EOS>
Mixed
with
the
warblings
of
innumerable
feathered
songsters
were
heard
the
cheering
notes
of
the
cuckoo
;
and
the
newly
-
arrived
swallows
were
seen
chasing
the
flies
along
the
plain
,
or
skimming
over
the
surface
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Already
had
Richard
's
depression
yielded
to
the
exhilarating
freshness
of
the
morning
,
and
the
same
kindly
influence
produced
a
more
salutary
effect
on
Nicholas
than
Parson
Dewhurst
's
lecture
had
been
able
to
accomplish
.
<EOS>
The
worthy
squire
was
a
true
lover
of
Nature
;
admiring
her
in
all
her
forms
,
whether
arrayed
in
pomp
of
wood
and
verdure
,
as
in
the
lovely
landscape
before
him
,
or
dreary
and
desolate
,
as
in
the
heathy
forest
wastes
they
were
about
to
traverse
.
<EOS>
While
breathing
the
fresh
morning
air
,
inhaling
the
fragrance
of
the
wild
-
flowers
,
and
listening
to
the
warbling
of
the
birds
,
he
took
a
well
-
pleased
survey
of
the
scene
,
commencing
with
the
bridge
,
passing
over
Whalley
Nab
and
the
mountainous
circle
conjoined
with
it
,
till
his
gaze
settled
on
Morton
Hall
,
a
noble
mansion
finely
situated
on
a
shoulder
of
the
hill
beyond
him
,
and
commanding
the
entire
valley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
I
not
owner
of
Downham
,
"
he
observed
to
Richard
,
"
I
should
wish
to
be
master
of
Morton
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
pointing
to
the
green
area
below
,
he
added
,
"
What
a
capital
spot
for
a
race
!
<EOS>
There
we
might
try
the
speed
of
our
nags
for
the
twenty
pieces
I
talked
of
yesterday
;
and
the
judges
of
the
match
and
those
who
chose
to
look
on
might
station
themselves
on
yon
knoll
,
which
seems
made
for
the
express
purpose
.
<EOS>
Three
years
ago
I
remember
a
fair
was
held
upon
that
plain
,
and
the
foot
-
races
,
the
wrestling
matches
,
and
the
various
sports
and
pastimes
of
the
rustics
,
viewed
from
the
knoll
,
formed
the
prettiest
sight
ever
looked
upon
.
<EOS>
But
,
pleasant
as
the
prospect
is
,
we
must
not
tarry
here
all
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
Before
setting
forward
,
he
cast
a
glance
towards
Pendle
Hill
,
which
formed
the
most
prominent
object
of
view
on
the
left
,
and
lay
like
a
leviathan
basking
in
the
sunshine
.
<EOS>
The
vast
mass
rose
up
gradually
until
at
its
further
extremity
it
attained
an
altitude
of
more
than
1800
feet
above
the
sea
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
it
was
without
a
cloud
,
and
the
whole
of
its
broad
outline
was
distinctly
visible
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
love
Pendle
Hill
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
enthusiastically
;
"
and
from
whatever
side
I
view
it
--
whether
from
this
place
,
where
I
see
it
from
end
to
end
,
from
its
lowest
point
to
its
highest
;
from
Padiham
,
where
it
frowns
upon
me
;
from
Clithero
,
where
it
smiles
;
or
from
Downham
,
where
it
rises
in
full
majesty
before
me
--
from
all
points
and
under
all
aspects
,
whether
robed
in
mist
or
radiant
with
sunshine
,
I
delight
in
it
.
<EOS>
Born
beneath
its
giant
shadow
,
I
look
upon
it
with
filial
regard
.
<EOS>
Some
folks
say
Pendle
Hill
wants
grandeur
and
sublimity
,
but
they
themselves
must
be
wanting
in
taste
.
<EOS>
Its
broad
,
round
,
smooth
mass
is
better
than
the
roughest
,
craggiest
,
shaggiest
,
most
sharply
splintered
mountain
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
And
then
what
a
view
it
commands!--Lancaster
with
its
grey
old
castle
on
one
hand
;
York
with
its
reverend
minster
on
the
other
--
the
Irish
Sea
and
its
wild
coast
--
fell
,
forest
,
moor
,
and
valley
,
watered
by
the
Ribble
,
the
Hodder
,
the
Calder
,
and
the
Lime
--
rivers
not
to
be
matched
for
beauty
.
<EOS>
You
recollect
the
old
distich--
           
'
Ingleborough
,
Pendle
Hill
,
and
Pennygent
,
           
Are
the
highest
hills
between
Scotland
and
Trent
.
'
 
<EOS>
This
vouches
for
its
height
,
but
there
are
two
other
doggerel
lines
still
more
to
the
purpose--
           
<EOS>
'
Pendle
Hill
,
Pennygent
,
and
Ingleborough
,
           
Are
three
such
hills
as
you
'll
not
find
by
seeking
England
               
thorough
.
'
 
<EOS>
With
this
opinion
I
quite
agree
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
hill
in
England
like
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Every
man
to
his
taste
,
squire
,
"
observed
Potts
;
"
but
to
my
mind
,
Pendle
Hill
has
no
other
recommendation
than
its
size
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
a
great
,
brown
,
ugly
,
lumpy
mass
,
without
beauty
of
form
or
any
striking
character
.
<EOS>
I
hate
your
bleak
Lancashire
hills
,
with
heathy
ranges
on
the
top
,
fit
only
for
the
sustenance
of
a
few
poor
half
-
starved
sheep
;
and
as
to
the
view
from
them
,
it
is
little
else
than
a
continuous
range
of
moors
and
dwarfed
forests
.
<EOS>
Highgate
Hill
is
quite
mountain
enough
for
me
,
and
Hampstead
Heath
wild
enough
for
any
civilised
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
veritable
son
of
Cockayne
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Nicholas
,
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
Riding
on
,
and
entering
the
grove
of
oaks
,
he
lost
sight
of
his
favourite
hill
,
though
glimpses
were
occasionally
caught
through
the
trees
of
the
lovely
valley
below
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
the
party
turned
off
on
the
left
,
and
presently
arrived
at
a
gate
which
admitted
them
to
Read
Park
.
<EOS>
Five
minutes
'
canter
over
the
springy
turf
then
brought
them
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
manor
of
Reved
or
Read
came
into
the
possession
of
the
Nowell
family
in
the
time
of
Edward
III
.
,
and
extended
on
one
side
,
within
a
mile
of
Whalley
,
from
which
township
it
was
divided
by
a
deep
woody
ravine
,
taking
its
name
from
the
little
village
of
Sabden
,
and
on
the
other
stretched
far
into
Pendle
Forest
.
<EOS>
The
hall
was
situated
on
an
eminence
forming
part
of
the
heights
of
Padiham
,
and
faced
a
wide
valley
,
watered
by
the
Calder
,
and
consisting
chiefly
of
barren
tracts
of
moor
and
forest
land
,
bounded
by
the
high
hills
near
Accrington
and
Rossendale
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
,
some
half
-
dozen
miles
off
,
lay
Burnley
,
and
the
greater
part
of
the
land
in
this
direction
,
being
uninclosed
and
thinly
peopled
,
had
a
dark
dreary
look
,
that
served
to
enhance
the
green
beauty
of
the
well
-
cultivated
district
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
Behind
the
mansion
,
thick
woods
extended
to
the
very
confines
of
Pendle
Forest
,
of
which
,
indeed
,
they
originally
formed
part
,
and
here
,
if
the
course
of
the
stream
,
flowing
through
the
gully
of
Sabden
,
were
followed
,
every
variety
of
brake
,
glen
,
and
dingle
,
might
be
found
.
<EOS>
Read
Hall
was
a
large
and
commodious
mansion
,
forming
,
with
a
centre
and
two
advancing
wings
,
three
sides
of
a
square
,
between
which
was
a
grass
-
plot
ornamented
with
a
dial
.
<EOS>
The
gardens
were
laid
out
in
the
taste
of
the
time
,
with
trim
alleys
and
parterres
,
terraces
and
steps
,
stone
statues
,
and
clipped
yews
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
kept
up
well
and
consistently
by
its
owner
,
who
lived
like
a
country
gentleman
with
a
good
estate
,
entertained
his
friends
hospitably
,
but
without
any
parade
,
and
was
never
needlessly
lavish
in
his
expenditure
,
unless
,
perhaps
,
in
the
instance
of
the
large
ostentatious
pew
erected
by
him
in
the
parish
church
of
Whalley
;
and
which
,
considering
he
had
a
private
chapel
at
home
,
and
maintained
a
domestic
chaplain
to
do
duty
in
it
,
seemed
little
required
,
and
drew
upon
him
the
censure
of
the
neighbouring
gossips
,
who
said
there
was
more
of
pride
than
religion
in
his
pew
.
<EOS>
With
the
chapel
at
the
hall
a
curious
history
was
afterwards
connected
.
<EOS>
Converted
into
a
dining
-
room
by
a
descendant
of
Roger
Nowell
,
the
apartment
was
incautiously
occupied
by
the
planner
of
the
alterations
before
the
plaster
was
thoroughly
dried
;
in
consequence
of
which
he
caught
a
severe
cold
,
and
died
in
the
desecrated
chamber
,
his
fate
being
looked
upon
as
a
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
With
many
good
qualities
<EOS>
Roger
Nowell
was
little
liked
.
<EOS>
His
austere
and
sarcastic
manner
repelled
his
equals
,
and
his
harshness
made
him
an
object
of
dislike
and
dread
among
his
inferiors
.
<EOS>
Besides
being
the
terror
of
all
evil
-
doers
,
he
was
a
hard
man
in
his
dealings
,
though
he
endeavoured
to
be
just
,
and
persuaded
himself
he
was
so
.
<EOS>
A
year
or
two
before
,
having
been
appointed
sheriff
of
the
county
,
he
had
discharged
the
important
office
with
so
much
zeal
and
ability
,
as
well
as
liberality
,
that
he
rose
considerably
in
public
estimation
.
<EOS>
It
was
during
this
period
that
Master
Potts
came
under
his
notice
at
Lancaster
,
and
the
little
attorney
's
shrewdness
gained
him
an
excellent
client
in
the
owner
of
Read
.
<EOS>
Roger
Newell
was
a
widower
;
but
his
son
,
who
resided
with
him
,
was
married
,
and
had
a
family
,
so
that
the
hall
was
fully
occupied
.
 
<EOS>
Roger
Nowell
was
turned
sixty
,
but
he
was
still
in
the
full
vigour
of
mind
and
body
,
his
temperate
and
active
habits
keeping
him
healthy
;
he
was
of
a
spare
muscular
frame
,
somewhat
bent
in
the
shoulders
,
and
had
very
sharp
features
,
keen
grey
eyes
,
a
close
mouth
,
and
prominent
chin
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
white
as
silver
,
but
his
eyebrows
were
still
black
and
bushy
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
the
party
approach
,
the
lord
of
the
mansion
came
forth
to
meet
them
,
and
begged
them
to
dismount
for
a
moment
and
refresh
themselves
.
<EOS>
Richard
excused
himself
,
but
Nicholas
sprang
from
his
saddle
,
and
Potts
,
though
somewhat
more
slowly
,
imitated
his
example
.
<EOS>
An
open
door
admitted
them
to
the
entrance
hall
,
where
a
repast
was
spread
,
of
which
the
host
pressed
his
guests
to
partake
;
but
Nicholas
declined
on
the
score
of
having
just
breakfasted
,
notwithstanding
which
he
was
easily
prevailed
upon
to
take
a
cup
of
ale
.
<EOS>
Leaving
him
to
discuss
it
,
Nowell
led
the
attorney
to
a
well
-
furnished
library
,
where
he
usually
transacted
his
magisterial
business
,
and
held
a
few
minutes
'
private
conference
with
him
,
after
which
they
returned
to
Nicholas
,
and
by
this
time
the
magistrate
's
own
horse
being
brought
round
,
the
party
mounted
once
more
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
regretted
abandoning
his
seat
;
for
Flint
indulged
him
with
another
exhibition
somewhat
similar
to
the
first
,
though
of
less
duration
,
for
a
vigorous
application
of
the
hunting
-
whip
brought
the
wrong
-
headed
little
animal
to
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Elated
by
the
victory
he
had
obtained
over
Flint
,
and
anticipating
a
successful
issue
to
the
expedition
,
Master
Potts
was
in
excellent
spirits
,
and
found
a
great
deal
to
admire
in
the
domain
of
his
honoured
and
singular
good
client
.
<EOS>
Though
not
very
genuine
,
his
admiration
was
deservedly
bestowed
.
<EOS>
The
portion
of
the
park
they
were
now
traversing
was
extremely
diversified
and
beautiful
,
with
long
sweeping
lawns
studded
with
fine
trees
,
among
which
were
many
ancient
thorns
,
now
in
full
bloom
,
and
richly
scenting
the
gale
.
<EOS>
Herds
of
deer
were
nipping
the
short
grass
,
browsing
the
lower
spray
of
the
ashes
,
or
couching
amid
the
ferny
hollows
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
that
Nicholas
,
who
had
been
all
along
anxious
to
try
the
speed
of
his
horse
,
proposed
to
Richard
a
gallop
towards
a
clump
of
trees
about
a
mile
off
,
and
the
young
man
assenting
,
<EOS>
away
they
started
.
<EOS>
Master
Potts
started
too
,
for
Flint
did
not
like
to
be
left
behind
,
but
the
mettlesome
pony
was
soon
distanced
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
the
two
horses
kept
so
closely
together
,
that
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
would
arrive
at
the
goal
first
;
but
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
Robin
got
a
-
head
.
<EOS>
Though
at
first
indifferent
to
the
issue
of
the
race
,
the
spirit
of
emulation
soon
seized
upon
Richard
,
and
spurring
Merlin
,
the
noble
animal
sprang
forward
,
and
was
once
again
by
the
side
of
his
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
ground
had
been
tolerably
level
,
and
the
sod
firm
;
but
they
now
approached
a
swamp
,
and
,
in
his
eagerness
,
Nicholas
did
not
take
sufficient
precaution
,
and
got
involved
in
it
before
he
was
aware
.
<EOS>
Richard
was
more
fortunate
,
having
kept
on
the
right
,
where
the
ground
was
hard
.
<EOS>
Seeing
Nicholas
struggling
out
of
the
marshy
soil
,
he
would
have
stayed
for
him
;
but
the
latter
bade
him
go
on
,
saying
he
would
soon
be
up
with
him
,
and
he
made
good
his
words
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
their
course
was
intercepted
by
a
brook
,
and
both
horses
having
cleared
it
excellently
,
they
kept
well
together
again
for
a
short
time
,
when
they
neared
a
deep
dyke
which
lay
between
them
and
the
clump
of
trees
.
<EOS>
On
descrying
it
,
Richard
pointed
out
a
course
to
the
left
,
but
Nicholas
held
on
,
unheeding
the
caution
.
<EOS>
Fully
expecting
to
see
him
break
his
neck
,
for
the
dyke
was
of
formidable
width
,
Richard
watched
him
with
apprehension
,
but
the
squire
gave
him
a
re
-
assuring
nod
,
and
went
on
.
<EOS>
Neither
horse
nor
man
faltered
,
though
failure
would
have
been
certain
destruction
to
both
.
<EOS>
The
wide
trench
now
yawned
before
them
--
they
were
upon
its
edge
,
and
without
trusting
himself
to
measure
it
with
his
eye
,
Nicholas
clapped
spurs
into
Robin
's
sides
.
<EOS>
The
brave
horse
sprang
forward
and
landed
him
safely
on
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
Hallooing
cheerily
,
as
soon
as
he
could
check
his
courser
the
squire
wheeled
round
,
and
rode
back
to
look
at
the
dyke
he
had
crossed
.
<EOS>
Its
width
was
terrific
,
and
fairly
astounded
him
.
<EOS>
Robin
snorted
loudly
,
as
if
proud
of
his
achievement
,
and
showed
some
disposition
to
return
,
but
the
squire
was
quite
content
with
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
The
exploit
afterwards
became
a
theme
of
wonder
throughout
the
country
,
and
the
spot
was
long
afterwards
pointed
out
as
"
Squire
Nicholas
's
Leap
"
;
but
there
was
not
another
horseman
found
daring
enough
to
repeat
the
experiment
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
had
to
make
a
considerable
circuit
to
join
his
cousin
,
and
,
while
he
was
going
round
,
Nicholas
looked
out
for
the
others
.
<EOS>
In
the
distance
,
he
could
see
Roger
Nowell
riding
leisurely
on
,
followed
by
Sparshot
and
a
couple
of
grooms
,
who
had
come
with
their
master
from
the
hall
;
while
midway
,
to
his
surprise
,
he
perceived
Flint
galloping
without
a
rider
.
<EOS>
A
closer
examination
showed
the
squire
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Like
himself
,
Master
Potts
had
incautiously
approached
the
swamp
,
and
,
getting
entangled
in
it
,
was
thrown
,
head
foremost
,
into
the
slough
;
out
of
which
he
was
now
floundering
,
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
inky
-
coloured
slime
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
aware
of
the
accident
,
the
two
grooms
pushed
forward
,
and
one
of
them
galloped
after
Flint
,
whom
he
succeeded
at
last
in
catching
;
while
the
other
,
with
difficulty
preserving
his
countenance
at
the
woful
plight
of
the
attorney
,
who
looked
as
black
as
a
negro
,
pointed
out
a
cottage
in
the
hollow
which
belonged
to
one
of
the
keepers
,
and
offered
to
conduct
him
thither
.
<EOS>
Potts
gladly
assented
,
and
soon
gained
the
little
tenement
,
where
he
was
being
washed
and
rubbed
down
by
a
couple
of
stout
wenches
when
the
rest
of
the
party
came
up
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
help
laughing
at
him
,
but
Potts
took
the
merriment
in
good
part
;
and
,
to
show
he
was
not
disheartened
by
the
misadventure
,
as
soon
as
circumstances
would
permit
he
mounted
the
unlucky
pony
,
and
the
cavalcade
set
forward
again
.

CHAPTER
III.--THE
BOGGART
'S
GLEN
.
  
<EOS>
The
manor
of
Read
,
it
has
been
said
,
was
skirted
by
a
deep
woody
ravine
of
three
or
four
miles
in
length
,
extending
from
the
little
village
of
Sabden
,
in
Pendle
Forest
,
to
within
a
short
distance
of
Whalley
;
and
through
this
gully
flowed
a
stream
which
,
taking
its
rise
near
Barley
,
at
the
foot
of
Pendle
Hill
,
added
its
waters
to
those
of
the
Calder
at
a
place
called
Cock
Bridge
.
<EOS>
In
summer
,
or
in
dry
seasons
,
this
stream
proceeded
quietly
enough
,
and
left
the
greater
part
of
its
stony
bed
unoccupied
;
but
in
winter
,
or
after
continuous
rains
,
it
assumed
all
the
character
of
a
mountain
torrent
,
and
swept
every
thing
before
it
.
<EOS>
A
narrow
bridle
road
led
through
the
ravine
to
Sabden
,
and
along
it
,
after
quitting
the
park
,
the
cavalcade
proceeded
,
headed
by
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
river
danced
merrily
past
them
,
singing
as
it
went
,
the
sunshine
sparkling
on
its
bright
clear
waters
,
and
glittering
on
the
pebbles
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
Now
the
stream
would
chafe
and
foam
against
some
larger
impediment
to
its
course
;
now
it
would
dash
down
some
rocky
height
,
and
form
a
beautiful
cascade
;
then
it
would
hurry
on
for
some
time
with
little
interruption
,
till
stayed
by
a
projecting
bank
it
would
form
a
small
deep
basin
,
where
,
beneath
the
far
-
cast
shadow
of
an
overhanging
oak
,
or
under
its
huge
twisted
and
denuded
roots
,
the
angler
might
be
sure
of
finding
the
speckled
trout
,
the
dainty
greyling
,
or
their
mutual
enemy
,
the
voracious
jack
.
<EOS>
The
ravine
was
well
wooded
throughout
,
and
in
many
parts
singularly
beautiful
,
from
the
disposition
of
the
timber
on
its
banks
,
as
well
as
from
the
varied
form
and
character
of
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Here
might
be
seen
an
acclivity
covered
with
waving
birch
,
or
a
top
crowned
with
a
mountain
ash
--
there
,
on
a
smooth
expanse
of
greensward
,
stood
a
range
of
noble
elms
,
whose
mighty
arms
stretched
completely
across
the
ravine
.
<EOS>
Further
on
,
there
were
chestnut
and
walnut
trees
;
willows
,
with
hoary
stems
and
silver
leaves
,
almost
encroaching
upon
the
stream
;
larches
upon
the
heights
;
and
here
and
there
,
upon
some
sandy
eminence
,
a
spreading
beech
-
tree
.
<EOS>
For
the
most
part
the
bottom
of
the
glen
was
overgrown
with
brushwood
,
and
,
where
its
sides
were
too
abrupt
to
admit
the
growth
of
larger
trees
,
they
were
matted
with
woodbine
and
brambles
.
<EOS>
Out
of
these
would
sometimes
start
a
sharp
pinnacle
,
or
fantastically
-
formed
crag
,
adding
greatly
to
the
picturesque
beauty
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
On
such
points
were
not
unfrequently
found
perched
a
hawk
,
a
falcon
,
or
some
large
bird
of
prey
;
for
the
gully
,
with
its
brakes
and
thickets
,
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
the
feathered
tribe
.
<EOS>
The
hollies
,
of
which
there
were
plenty
,
with
their
green
prickly
leaves
and
scarlet
berries
,
afforded
shelter
and
support
to
the
blackbird
;
the
thorns
were
frequented
by
the
thrush
;
and
numberless
lesser
songsters
filled
every
other
tree
.
<EOS>
In
the
covert
there
were
pheasants
and
partridges
in
abundance
,
and
snipe
and
wild
-
fowl
resorted
to
the
river
in
winter
.
<EOS>
Thither
also
,
at
all
seasons
,
repaired
the
stately
heron
,
to
devour
the
finny
race
;
and
thither
came
,
on
like
errand
,
the
splendidly
-
plumed
kingfisher
.
<EOS>
The
magpie
chattered
,
the
jay
screamed
and
flew
deeper
into
the
woods
as
the
horsemen
approached
,
and
the
shy
bittern
hid
herself
amid
the
rushes
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
too
,
was
heard
the
deep
ominous
croaking
of
a
raven
.
 
<EOS>
[

POTTS
AFTER
BEING
THROWN
FROM
HIS
HORSE
.
]
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
the
glen
had
been
remarkable
for
its
softness
and
beauty
,
but
it
now
began
to
assume
a
savage
and
sombre
character
.
<EOS>
The
banks
drew
closer
together
,
and
became
rugged
and
precipitous
;
while
the
trees
met
overhead
,
and
,
intermingling
their
branches
,
formed
a
canopy
impervious
to
the
sun
's
rays
.
<EOS>
The
stream
was
likewise
contracted
in
its
bed
,
and
its
current
,
which
,
owing
to
the
gloom
,
looked
black
as
ink
,
flowed
swiftly
on
,
as
if
anxious
to
escape
to
livelier
scenes
.
<EOS>
A
large
raven
,
which
had
attended
the
horsemen
all
the
way
,
now
alighted
near
them
,
and
croaked
ominously
.
 
<EOS>
This
part
of
the
glen
was
in
very
ill
repute
,
and
was
never
traversed
,
even
at
noonday
,
without
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Its
wild
and
savage
aspect
,
its
horrent
precipices
,
its
shaggy
woods
,
its
strangely
-
shaped
rocks
and
tenebrous
depths
,
where
every
imperfectly
-
seen
object
appeared
doubly
frightful
--
all
combined
to
invest
it
with
mystery
and
terror
.
<EOS>
No
one
willingly
lingered
here
,
but
hurried
on
,
afraid
of
the
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
.
<EOS>
No
one
dared
to
gaze
at
the
rocks
,
lest
he
should
see
some
hideous
hobgoblin
peering
out
of
their
fissures
.
<EOS>
No
one
glanced
at
the
water
,
for
fear
some
terrible
kelpy
,
with
twining
snakes
for
hair
and
scaly
hide
,
should
issue
from
it
and
drag
him
down
to
devour
him
with
his
shark
-
like
teeth
.
<EOS>
Among
the
common
folk
,
this
part
of
the
ravine
was
known
as
"
the
boggart
's
glen
"
,
and
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
by
mischievous
beings
,
who
made
the
unfortunate
wanderer
their
sport
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
last
half
-
mile
the
road
had
been
so
narrow
and
intricate
in
its
windings
,
that
the
party
were
obliged
to
proceed
singly
;
but
this
did
not
prevent
conversation
;
and
Nicholas
,
throwing
the
bridle
over
Robin
's
neck
,
left
the
surefooted
animal
to
pursue
his
course
unguided
,
while
he
himself
,
leaning
back
,
chatted
with
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
At
the
entrance
of
the
gloomy
gorge
above
described
,
Robin
came
to
a
stand
,
and
refusing
to
move
at
a
jerk
from
his
master
,
the
latter
raised
himself
,
and
looked
forward
to
see
what
could
be
the
cause
of
the
stoppage
.
<EOS>
No
impediment
was
visible
,
but
the
animal
obstinately
refused
to
go
on
,
though
urged
both
by
word
and
spur
.
<EOS>
This
stoppage
necessarily
delayed
the
rest
of
the
cavalcade
.
 
<EOS>
Well
aware
of
the
ill
reputation
of
the
place
,
when
Simon
Sparshot
and
the
grooms
found
that
Robin
would
not
go
on
,
they
declared
he
must
see
the
boggart
,
and
urged
the
squire
to
turn
back
,
or
some
mischief
would
befall
him
.
<EOS>
But
Nicholas
,
though
not
without
misgivings
,
did
not
like
to
yield
thus
,
especially
when
urged
on
by
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
party
could
not
get
out
of
the
ravine
without
going
back
nearly
a
mile
,
while
Sabden
was
only
half
that
distance
from
them
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
Robin
still
continued
obstinate
,
and
for
the
first
time
paid
no
attention
to
his
master
's
commands
.
<EOS>
The
poor
animal
was
evidently
a
prey
to
violent
terror
,
and
snorted
and
reared
,
while
his
limbs
were
bathed
in
cold
sweat
.
 
<EOS>
Dismounting
,
and
leaving
him
in
charge
of
Roger
Nowell
,
Nicholas
walked
on
by
himself
to
see
if
he
could
discover
any
cause
for
the
horse
's
alarm
;
and
he
had
not
advanced
far
,
when
his
eye
rested
upon
a
blasted
oak
forming
a
conspicuous
object
on
a
crag
before
him
,
on
a
scathed
branch
of
which
sat
the
raven
.
 
<EOS>
Croak
!
<EOS>
croak
!
<EOS>
croak
!
 
<EOS>
"
Accursed
bird
,
it
is
thou
who
hast
frightened
my
horse
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
I
had
a
crossbow
or
an
arquebuss
to
stop
thy
croaking
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
picked
up
a
stone
to
cast
at
the
raven
,
a
crashing
noise
was
heard
among
the
bushes
high
up
on
the
rock
,
and
the
next
moment
a
huge
fragment
dislodged
from
the
cliff
rolled
down
and
would
have
crushed
him
,
if
he
had
not
nimbly
avoided
it
.
 
<EOS>
Croak
!
<EOS>
croak
!
<EOS>
croak
!
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
almost
fancied
hoarse
laughter
was
mingled
with
the
cries
of
the
bird
.
 
<EOS>
The
raven
nodded
its
head
and
expanded
its
wings
,
and
the
squire
,
whose
recent
experience
had
prepared
him
for
any
wonder
,
fully
expected
to
hear
it
speak
,
but
it
only
croaked
loudly
and
exultingly
,
or
if
it
laughed
,
the
sound
was
like
the
creaking
of
rusty
hinges
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
did
not
like
it
at
all
,
and
he
resolved
to
go
back
;
but
ere
he
could
do
so
,
he
was
startled
by
a
buffet
on
the
ear
,
and
turning
angrily
round
to
see
who
had
dealt
it
<EOS>
,
he
could
distinguish
no
one
,
but
at
the
same
moment
received
a
second
buffet
on
the
other
ear
.
 
<EOS>
The
raven
croaked
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
I
could
wring
thy
neck
,
accursed
bird
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
enraged
squire
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
was
the
vindictive
wish
uttered
than
a
shower
of
blows
fell
upon
him
,
and
kicks
from
unseen
feet
were
applied
to
his
person
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
while
the
raven
croaked
merrily
,
and
flapped
his
big
black
wings
.
 
<EOS>
Infuriated
by
the
attack
,
the
squire
hit
right
and
left
manfully
,
and
dashed
out
his
feet
in
every
direction
;
but
his
blows
and
kicks
only
met
the
empty
air
,
while
those
of
his
unseen
antagonist
told
upon
his
own
person
with
increased
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
spectacle
seemed
to
afford
infinite
amusement
to
the
raven
.
<EOS>
The
mischievous
bird
almost
crowed
with
glee
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
standing
it
any
longer
.
<EOS>
So
,
amid
a
perfect
hurricane
of
blows
and
kicks
,
and
with
the
infernal
voice
of
the
raven
ringing
in
his
ears
,
the
squire
took
to
his
heels
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
his
companions
he
found
they
had
not
fared
much
better
than
himself
.
<EOS>
The
two
grooms
were
belabouring
each
other
lustily
;
and
Master
Potts
was
exercising
his
hunting
-
whip
on
the
broad
shoulders
of
Sparshot
,
who
in
return
was
making
him
acquainted
with
the
taste
of
a
stout
ash
-
plant
.
<EOS>
Assailed
in
the
same
manner
as
the
squire
,
and
naturally
attributing
the
attack
to
their
nearest
neighbours
,
they
waited
for
no
explanation
,
but
fell
upon
each
other
.
<EOS>
Richard
Assheton
and
Roger
Nowell
endeavoured
to
interfere
and
separate
the
combatants
,
and
in
doing
so
received
some
hard
knocks
for
their
pains
;
but
all
their
pacific
efforts
were
fruitless
,
until
the
squire
appeared
,
and
telling
them
they
were
merely
the
sport
of
hobgoblins
<EOS>
,
they
desisted
,
but
still
the
blows
fell
heavily
on
them
as
before
,
proving
the
truth
of
Nicholas
's
assertion
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
squire
had
mounted
Robin
,
and
,
finding
the
horse
no
longer
exhibit
the
same
reluctance
to
proceed
,
he
dashed
at
full
speed
through
the
haunted
glen
;
but
even
above
the
clatter
,
of
hoofs
,
and
the
noise
of
the
party
galloping
after
him
,
he
could
hear
the
hoarse
exulting
croaking
of
the
raven
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
gully
expanded
,
and
the
sun
once
more
found
its
way
through
the
trees
,
and
shone
upon
the
river
<EOS>
,
Nicholas
began
to
breathe
more
freely
;
but
it
was
not
until
fairly
out
of
the
wood
that
he
relaxed
his
speed
.
<EOS>
Not
caring
to
enter
into
any
explanation
of
the
occurrence
,
he
rode
a
little
apart
to
avoid
conversation
;
as
the
others
,
who
were
still
smarting
from
the
blows
they
had
received
,
were
in
no
very
good
-
humour
,
a
sullen
silence
prevailed
throughout
the
party
,
as
they
mounted
the
bare
hill
-
side
in
the
direction
of
the
few
scattered
huts
constituting
the
village
of
Sabden
.
 
<EOS>
A
blight
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
the
place
.
<EOS>
Roger
Nowell
,
who
had
visited
it
a
few
months
ago
,
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
,
so
changed
was
its
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
inquiries
as
to
the
cause
of
its
altered
condition
were
every
where
met
by
the
same
answer
--
the
poor
people
were
all
bewitched
.
<EOS>
Here
a
child
was
ill
of
a
strange
sickness
,
tossed
and
tumbled
in
its
bed
,
and
contorted
its
limbs
so
violently
,
that
its
parents
could
scarcely
hold
it
down
.
<EOS>
Another
family
was
afflicted
in
a
different
manner
,
two
of
its
number
pining
away
and
losing
strength
daily
,
as
if
a
prey
to
some
consuming
disease
.
<EOS>
In
a
third
,
another
child
was
sick
,
and
vomited
pins
,
nails
,
and
other
extraordinary
substances
.
<EOS>
A
fourth
household
was
tormented
by
an
imp
in
the
form
of
a
monkey
,
who
came
at
night
and
pinched
them
all
black
and
blue
,
spilt
the
milk
,
broke
the
dishes
and
platters
,
got
under
the
bed
,
and
,
raising
it
to
the
roof
,
let
it
fall
with
a
terrible
crash
;
putting
them
all
in
mental
terror
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
cottage
there
was
no
end
to
calamities
,
though
they
took
a
more
absurd
form
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
fire
would
not
burn
,
or
when
it
did
it
emitted
no
heat
,
so
that
the
pot
would
not
boil
,
nor
the
meat
roast
.
<EOS>
Then
the
oatcakes
would
stick
to
the
bake
-
stone
,
and
no
force
could
get
them
away
from
it
till
they
were
burnt
and
spoiled
;
the
milk
turned
sour
,
the
cheese
became
so
hard
that
not
even
rats
'
teeth
could
gnaw
it
,
the
stools
and
settles
broke
down
if
sat
upon
,
and
the
list
of
petty
grievances
was
completed
by
a
whole
side
of
bacon
being
devoured
in
a
single
night
.
<EOS>
Roger
Nowell
and
Nicholas
listened
patiently
to
a
detail
of
all
these
grievances
,
and
expressed
strong
sympathy
for
the
sufferers
,
promising
assistance
and
redress
if
possible
.
<EOS>
All
the
complainants
taxed
either
Mother
Demdike
or
Mother
Chattox
with
afflicting
them
,
and
said
they
had
incurred
the
anger
of
the
two
malevolent
old
witches
by
refusing
to
supply
them
with
poultry
,
eggs
,
milk
,
butter
,
or
other
articles
,
which
they
had
demanded
.
<EOS>
Master
Potts
made
ample
notes
of
the
strange
relations
,
and
took
down
the
name
of
every
cottager
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
they
arrived
at
the
last
cottage
,
and
here
a
man
,
with
a
very
doleful
countenance
,
besought
them
to
stop
and
listen
to
his
tale
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter

"
demanded
Roger
Nowell
,
halting
with
the
others
.
<EOS>
"

"

said
Potts
,
taking
out

and
making
a
note
in
it
.
<EOS>
"

"
Is

"
asked
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
more
would
you
have
?
"
said
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
The
description
is
sufficiently
particular

"
 
<EOS>
"
Scarcely
precise
enough
,
"
returned
Potts
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
it
may
do
.
<EOS>
We
will
help
you
in

good
Humphrey

<EOS>
You

pestilent

"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'm
reet
glad

"
replied
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
promise
much
,
Master
Potts
,
"
observed
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
jot
more
than
I
am
able
to
perform
,
"
replied
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
said
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
If
these
old
women
are
as
powerful
as
represented
,
they
will
not
be
so
readily
defeated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
in
error
,
Master
Richard
,
"
replied
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
devil
,
whose
vassals
they
are
,
will
deliver
them
into
our
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Granting
what
you
say
to
be
correct
,
the
devil
must
have
little
regard
for
his
servants
if
he
abandons
them
so
easily
,
"
observed
Richard
,
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
else
can
you
expect
from
him
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
his
custom
to
ensnare
his
victims
,
and
then
leave
them
to
their
fate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
rather
describing
the
course
pursued
by
certain
members
of
your
own
profession
,
Master
Potts
,
"
said
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
devil
behaves
with
greater
fairness
to
his
clients
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
to
defend
him
,
I
hope
,
sir
?
"
said
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
only
desire
to
give
him
his
due
,
"
returned
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
"
laughed
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
have
done
,
Master
Potts
;
you
will
never
get
the
better
in
the
argument
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
be
moving
,
or
we
shall
not
get
our
business
done
before
nightfall
.
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
Numps
,
"
he
added
,
to
the
poor
man
,
"
we
will
not
forget
you
.
<EOS>
If
any
thing
can
be
done
for
your
relief
,
rely
upon
it
,
it
shall
not
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
said
Nowell
,
"
the
matter
shall
be
looked
into
--
and
speedily
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
witches
brought
to
justice
,
"
said
Potts
;
"
comfort
yourself
with
that
,
good
Humphrey
Etcetera
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
comfort
yourself
with
that
,
"
observed
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
they
entered
a
wide
dreary
waste
forming
the
bottom
of
the
valley
,
lying
between
the
heights
of
Padiham
and
Pendle
Hill
,
and
while
wending
their
way
across
it
,
they
heard
a
shout
from
the
hill
-
side
,
and
presently
afterwards
perceived
a
man
,
mounted
on
a
powerful
black
horse
,
galloping
swiftly
towards
them
.
<EOS>
The
party
awaited
his
approach
,
and
the
stranger
speedily
came
up
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
small
man
habited
in
a
suit
of
rusty
black
,
and
bore
a
most
extraordinary
and
marked
resemblance
to
Master
Potts
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
same
perky
features
,
the
same
parchment
complexion
,
the
same
yellow
forehead
,
as
the
little
attorney
.
<EOS>
So
surprising
was
the
likeness
,
that
Nicholas
unconsciously
looked
round
for
Potts
,
and
beheld
him
staring
at
the
new
-
comer
in
angry
wonder
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IV.--THE
REEVE
OF
THE
FOREST
.
  
<EOS>
The
surprise
of
the
party
was
by
no
means
diminished
when
the
stranger
spoke
.
<EOS>
His
voice
exactly
resembled
the
sharp
cracked
tones
of
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
crave
pardon
for
the
freedom
I
have
taken
in
stopping
you
,
good
masters
,
"
he
said
,
doffing
his
cap
,
and
saluting
them
respectfully
;
"
<EOS>
but
,
being
aware
of
your
errand
,
I
am
come
to
attend
you
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
are
you
,
fellow
,
who
thus
volunteer
your
services
?
"
demanded
Roger
Nowell
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
one
of
the
reeves
of
the
forest
of
Blackburnshire
,
worshipful
sir
,
"
replied
the
stranger
,
"
and
as
such
my
presence
,
at
the
intended
perambulation
of
the
boundaries
of
her
property
,
has
been
deemed
necessary
by
Mrs.
Nutter
,
as
I
shall
have
to
make
a
representation
of
the
matter
at
the
next
court
of
swainmote
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Nowell
,
"
but
how
knew
you
we
were
coming
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mistress
Nutter
sent
me
word
last
night
,
"
replied
the
reeve
,
"
that
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
and
certain
other
gentlemen
,
would
come
to
Rough
Lee
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
marks
,
meres
,
and
boundaries
of
her
property
,
early
this
morning
,
and
desired
my
attendance
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
stationed
myself
on
yon
high
ground
to
look
out
for
you
,
and
have
been
on
the
watch
for
more
than
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
exclaimed
Roger
Nowell
,
"
and
you
live
in
the
forest
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
live
at
Barrowford
,
worshipful
sir
,
"
replied
the
reeve
,
"
but
I
have
only
lately
come
there
,
having
succeeded
Maurice
Mottisfont
,
the
other
reeve
,
who
has
been
removed
by
the
master
forester
to
Rossendale
,
where
I
formerly
dwelt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
may
account
for
my
not
having
seen
you
before
,
"
rejoined
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
well
mounted
,

<EOS>
I
did
not
know
the
master
forester
allowed
his
men
such
horses
as
the
one
you
ride
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
horse
does
not
belong
to
me
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
reeve
;
"
it
has
been
lent
me
by
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
<EOS>
I
see
how
it
is
now
,
"
cried
Nowell
;
"
you
are
suborned
to
give
false
testimony
,
knave
.
<EOS>
I
object
to
his
attendance
,
Master
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
think
you
do
the
man
injustice
,
"
said
the
squire
.
"
<EOS>
He
speaks
frankly
and
fairly
enough
,
and
seems
to
know
his
business
.
<EOS>
The
worst
that
can
be
said
against
him
is
,
that
he
resembles
somewhat
too
closely
our
little
legal
friend
there
.
<EOS>
That
,
however
,
ought
to
be
no
objection
to
you
,
Master
Nowell
,
but
rather
the
contrary
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
take
the
responsibility
of
the
matter
upon
your
own
shoulders
,
"
said
Nowell
;
"
if
any
ill
comes
of
it
I
shall
blame
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
replied
the
squire
;
"
my
shoulders
are
broad
enough
to
bear
the
burthen
.
<EOS>
You
may
ride
with
us
,
master
reeve
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
inquire
your
name
,
friend
?
<EOS>
"
said
Potts
,
as
the
stranger
fell
back
to
the
rear
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thomas
Potts
,
at
your
service
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
reeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
What!--Thomas
Potts
!
"
exclaimed
the
astonished
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
name
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
reeve
,
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
zounds
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Nicholas
,
who
overheard
the
reply
,
"
you
do
not
mean
to
say
your
name
is
Thomas
Potts
?
<EOS>
This
is
more
wonderful
still
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
this
gentleman
's
twin
brother
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
certainly
seems
to
resemble
me
very
strongly
,
"
replied
the
reeve
,
apparently
surprised
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
he
of
these
parts
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
,
"
returned
Potts
,
angrily
,
"
I
am
from
London
,
where
I
reside
in
Chancery
-
lane
,
and
practise
the
law
,
though
I
likewise
attend
as
clerk
of
the
court
at
the
assizes
at
Lancaster
,
where
I
may
possibly
,
one
of
these
days
,
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
,
my
pretended
namesake
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Possibly
,
sir
,
"
said
the
reeve
,
with
provoking
calmness
.
<EOS>
"
I
myself
am
from
Chester
,
and
like
yourself
was
brought
up
to
the
law
,
but
I
abandoned
my
profession
,
or
rather
it
abandoned
me
,
for
I
had
few
clients
;
so
I
took
to
an
honester
calling
,
and
became
a
forester
,
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
a
draper
in
the
city
I
have
mentioned
,
and
dwelt
in
Watergate
-
street
--
his
name
was
Peter
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peter
Potts
your
father
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
attorney
,
in
the
last
state
of
astonishment--"Why
,
he
was
mine
!
<EOS>
But
I
am
his
only
son
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Up
to
this
moment
I
conceived
myself
an
only
son
,
"
said
the
reeve
;
"
but
it
seems
I
was
mistaken
,
since
I
find
I
have
an
elder
brother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Elder
brother
!
"
exclaimed
Potts
,
wrathfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
older
than
I
am
by
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
all
a
fabrication
.
<EOS>
I
deny
the
relationship
entirely
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
make
me
other
than
the
son
of
my
father
,
"
said
the
reeve
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Master
Potts
,
"
interposed
Nicholas
,
laughing
,
"
I
see
no
reason
why
you
should
be
ashamed
of
your
brother
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
strong
family
likeness
between
you
.
<EOS>
So
old
Peter
Potts
,
the
draper
of
Chester
,
was
your
father
,
eh
?
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
of
the
circumstance
before
--
ha
,
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
but
for
this
intrusive
fellow
,
you
would
never
have
become
aware
of
it
,
"
muttered
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
Give
ear
to
me
,
squire
,
"
he
said
,
urging
Flint
close
up
to
the
other
's
side
,
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
,
"
I
do
not
like
the
fellow
's
looks
at
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
surprised
at
that
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
,
"
for
he
exactly
resembles
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
why
I
do
not
like
him
,
"
said
Potts
;
"
I
believe
him
to
be
a
wizard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
no
wizard
to
think
so
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
.
<EOS>
And
he
rode
on
to
join
Roger
Nowell
,
who
was
a
little
in
advance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
him
on
the
subject
of
witchcraft
,
"
thought
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
dwell
in
the
forest
,
"
he
said
to
the
reeve
,
"
you
have
no
doubt
seen
those
two
terrible
beings
,
Mothers
Demdike
and
Chattox
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Frequently
,
"
replied
the
reeve
,
"
but
I
would
rather
not
talk
about
them
in
their
own
territories
.
<EOS>
You
may
judge
of
their
power
by
the
appearance
of
the
village
you
have
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
that
unlucky
place
refused
them
their
customary
tributes
,
and
have
therefore
incurred
their
resentment
.
<EOS>
You
will
meet
other
instances
of
the
like
kind
before
you
have
gone
far
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
for
I
want
to
collect
as
many
cases
as
I
can
of
witchcraft
,
"
observed
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
will
be
of
little
use
to
you
,
"
observed
the
reeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
so
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
if
the
witches
discover
what
you
are
about
,
as
they
will
not
fail
to
do
,
you
will
never
leave
the
forest
alive
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
not
?
"
cried
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
replied
the
reeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
deterred
from
the
performance
of
my
duty
,
"
said
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
I
defy
the
devil
and
all
his
works
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
reason
to
repent
your
temerity
,
"
replied
the
reeve
.
 
<EOS>
And
anxious
,
apparently
,
to
avoid
further
conversation
on
the
subject
,
he
drew
in
the
rein
for
a
moment
,
and
allowed
the
attorney
to
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
boasting
,
Master
Potts
was
not
without
much
secret
misgiving
;
but
his
constitutional
obstinacy
made
him
determine
to
prosecute
his
plans
at
any
risk
,
and
he
comforted
himself
by
recalling
the
opinion
of
his
sovereign
authority
on
such
matters
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
ponder
over
the
exact
words
of
our
British
Solomon
,
"
he
thought
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
his
learned
treatise
by
heart
,
and
it
is
fortunate
my
memory
serves
me
so
well
,
for
the
sagacious
prince
's
dictum
will
fortify
me
in
my
resolution
,
which
has
been
somewhat
shaken
by
this
fellow
,
whom
I
believe
to
be
no
better
than
he
should
be
,
for
all
he
calls
himself
my
father
's
son
,
and
hath
assumed
my
likeness
,
doubtless
for
some
mischievous
purpose
.
'
<EOS>
If
the
magistrate
,
'
saith
the
King
,
'
be
slothful
towards
witches
,
God
is
very
able
to
make
them
instruments
to
waken
and
punish
his
sloth
.
'
<EOS>
No
one
can
accuse
me
of
slothfulness
and
want
of
zeal
.
<EOS>
My
best
exertions
have
been
used
against
the
accursed
creatures
.
<EOS>
And
now
for
the
rest
.
'
<EOS>
But
if
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
be
diligent
in
examining
and
punishing
them
,
God
will
not
permit
their
master
to
trouble
or
hinder
so
good
a
work
!
'
<EOS>
Exactly
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
easy
now
,
and
shall
go
on
fearlessly
as
before
.
<EOS>
I
am
one
of
the
'
lawful
lieutenants
'
described
by
the
King
,
and
can
not
be
'
defrauded
or
deprived
'
of
my
office
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
these
thoughts
passed
through
the
attorney
's
mind
a
low
derisive
laugh
sounded
in
his
ears
,
and
,
connecting
it
with
the
reeve
,
he
looked
back
and
found
the
object
of
his
suspicions
gazing
at
him
,
and
chuckling
maliciously
.
<EOS>
So
fiendishly
malignant
,
indeed
,
was
the
gaze
fixed
upon
him
,
that
Potts
was
glad
to
turn
his
head
away
to
avoid
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
confirmed
in
my
suspicions
<EOS>
,
"
he
thought
;
"
he
is
evidently
a
wizard
,
if
he
be
not--
"
 
<EOS>
Again
the
mocking
laugh
sounded
in
his
ears
,
but
he
did
not
venture
to
look
round
this
time
,
being
fearful
of
once
more
encountering
the
terrible
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
party
had
traversed
the
valley
,
and
to
avoid
a
dangerous
morass
stretching
across
its
lower
extremity
,
and
shorten
the
distance
--
for
the
ordinary
road
would
have
led
them
too
much
to
the
right
<EOS>
--
they
began
to
climb
one
of
the
ridges
of
Pendle
Hill
,
which
lay
between
them
and
the
vale
they
wished
to
gain
.
<EOS>
On
obtaining
the
top
of
this
eminence
,
an
extensive
view
on
either
side
opened
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Behind
was
the
sterile
valley
they
had
just
crossed
,
its
black
soil
,
hoary
grass
,
and
heathy
wastes
,
only
enlivened
at
one
end
by
patches
of
bright
sulphur
-
coloured
moss
,
which
masked
a
treacherous
quagmire
lurking
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
cottages
in
Sabden
were
visible
,
and
,
from
the
sad
circumstances
connected
with
them
,
and
which
oppressed
the
thoughts
of
the
beholders
,
added
to
the
dreary
character
of
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
The
day
,
too
,
had
lost
its
previous
splendour
,
and
there
were
clouds
overhead
which
cast
deep
shadows
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
crest
of
Pendle
Hill
,
which
rose
above
them
,
a
sun
-
burst
fell
,
and
attracted
attention
from
its
brilliant
contrast
to
the
prevailing
gloom
.
<EOS>
Before
them
lay
a
deep
gully
,
the
sinuosities
of
which
could
be
traced
from
the
elevated
position
where
they
stood
,
though
its
termination
was
hidden
by
other
projecting
ridges
.
<EOS>
Further
on
,
the
sides
of
the
mountain
were
bare
and
rugged
,
and
covered
with
shelving
stone
.
<EOS>
Beyond
the
defile
before
mentioned
,
and
over
the
last
mountain
ridge
,
lay
a
wide
valley
,
bounded
on
the
further
side
by
the
hills
overlooking
Colne
,
and
the
mountain
defile
,
now
laid
open
to
the
travellers
,
exhibiting
in
the
midst
of
the
dark
heathy
ranges
,
which
were
its
distinguishing
features
,
some
marks
of
cultivation
.
<EOS>
In
parts
it
was
inclosed
and
divided
into
paddocks
by
stone
walls
,
and
here
and
there
a
few
cottages
were
collected
together
,
dignified
,
as
in
the
case
of
Sabden
,
by
the
name
of
a
village
.
<EOS>
Amongst
these
were
the
Hey
-
houses
,
an
assemblage
of
small
stone
tenements
,
the
earliest
that
arose
in
the
forest
;
Goldshaw
Booth
,
now
a
populous
place
,
and
even
then
the
largest
hamlet
in
the
district
;
and
in
the
distance
Ogden
and
Barley
,
the
two
latter
scarcely
comprising
a
dozen
habitations
,
and
those
little
better
than
huts
.
<EOS>
In
some
sheltered
nook
on
the
hill
-
side
might
be
discerned
the
solitary
cottage
of
a
cowherd
,
and
not
far
from
it
the
certain
accompaniment
of
a
sheepfold
.
<EOS>
Throughout
this
weird
region
,
thinly
peopled
it
is
true
,
but
still
of
great
extent
,
and
apparently
abandoned
to
the
powers
of
darkness
,
only
one
edifice
could
be
found
where
its
inhabitants
could
meet
to
pray
,
and
this
was
an
ancient
chapel
at
Goldshaw
Booth
,
originally
erected
in
the
reign
of
Henry
III
.
,
though
subsequently
in
part
rebuilt
in
1544
,
and
which
,
with
its
low
grey
tower
peeping
from
out
the
trees
,
was
just
discernible
.
<EOS>
Two
halls
were
in
view
;
one
of
which
,
Sabden
,
was
of
considerable
antiquity
,
and
gave
its
name
to
the
village
;
and
the
other
was
Hoarstones
,
a
much
more
recently
erected
mansion
,
strikingly
situated
on
an
acclivity
of
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
In
general
,
the
upper
parts
of
this
mountain
monarch
of
the
waste
were
bare
and
heathy
,
while
the
heights
overhanging
Ogden
and
Barley
were
rocky
,
shelving
,
and
precipitous
;
but
the
lower
ridges
were
well
covered
with
wood
,
and
a
thicket
,
once
forming
part
of
the
ancieut
forest
,
ran
far
out
into
the
plain
near
Goldshaw
Booth
.
<EOS>
Numerous
springs
burst
from
the
mountain
side
,
and
these
collecting
their
forces
,
formed
a
considerable
stream
,
which
,
under
the
name
of
Pendle
Water
,
flowed
through
the
valley
above
described
,
and
,
after
many
picturesque
windings
,
entered
the
rugged
glen
in
which
Rough
Lee
was
situated
,
and
swept
past
the
foot
of
Mistress
Nutter
's
residence
.
 
<EOS>
Descending
the
hill
,
and
passing
through
the
thicket
,
the
party
came
within
a
short
distance
of
Goldshaw
Booth
,
when
they
were
met
by
a
cowherd
,
who
,
with
looks
of
great
alarm
,
told
them
that
John
Law
,
the
pedlar
,
had
fallen
down
in
a
fit
in
the
clough
,
and
would
perish
if
they
did
not
stay
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
As
the
poor
man
in
question
was
well
known
both
to
Nicholas
and
Roger
Nowell
,
they
immediately
agreed
to
go
to
his
assistance
,
and
accompanied
the
cowherd
along
a
by
-
road
which
led
through
the
clough
to
the
village
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
gone
far
when
they
heard
loud
groans
,
and
presently
afterwards
found
the
unfortunate
pedlar
lying
on
his
back
,
and
writhing
in
agony
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
large
,
powerfully
-
built
man
,
of
middle
age
,
and
had
been
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
health
and
vigour
,
so
that
his
sudden
prostration
was
the
more
terrible
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
greatly
disfigured
,
the
mouth
and
neck
drawn
awry
<EOS>
,
the
left
eye
pulled
down
,
and
the
whole
power
of
the
same

said
Richard--"especially

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
surely
doubt

it

so

Master

"
cried
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
offer
no
opinion
,
"
replied
the
young
man
;
"
but
a
paralytic
stroke
would
produce
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
But
,
instead
of
discussing
the
matter
,
the
best
thing
we
can
do
will
be
to
transport
the
poor
man
to
Bess
's
o
'
th
'
Booth
,
where
he
can
be
attended
to
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tom

I

if
Abel

charge
of

"
said
one
of
the
grooms
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
win
,
"
replied
the
cowherd
,
unstrapping
the
box
,
upon
which
the
sufferer
's
head
rested
,
and
placing
it
on
his
own
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
a
gate
having
been
taken
from
its
hinges
by
Sparshot
and
the
reeve
,
the
poor
pedlar
,
who
groaned
deeply
during
the
operation
,
was
placed
upon
it
by
the
men
,
and
borne
towards
the
village
,
followed
by
the
others
,
leading
their
horses
.
 
<EOS>
Great
consternation
was
occasioned
in
Goldshaw
Booth
by
the
entrance
of
the
cavalcade
,
and
still
more
,
when
it
became
known
that
John
Law
,
the
pedlar
,
who
was
a
favourite
with
all
,
had
had
a
frightful
seizure
.
<EOS>
Old
and
young
flocked
forth
to
see
him
,
and
the
former
shook
their
heads
,
while
the
latter
were
appalled
at
the
hideous
sight
.
<EOS>
Master
Potts
took
care
to
tell
them
that
the
poor
fellow
was
bewitched
by
Mother
Demdike
;
but
the
information
failed
to
produce
the
effect
he
anticipated
,
and
served
rather
to
repress
than
heighten
their
sympathy
for
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
concluded
,
and
justly
,
that
they
were
afraid
of
incurring
the
displeasure
of
the
vindictive
old
hag
by
an
open
expression
of
interest
in
his
fate
.
<EOS>
So
strongly
did
this
feeling
operate
,
that
after
bestowing
a
glance
of
commiseration
at
the
pedlar
,
most
of
them
returned
,
without
a
word
,
to
their
dwellings
.
 
<EOS>
On
their
way
to
the
little
hostel
,
whither
they
were
conveying
the
poor
pedlar
,
the
party
passed
the
church
,
and
the
sexton
,
who
was
digging
a
grave
in
the
yard
,
came
forward
to
look
at
them
;
but
on
seeing
John
Law
he
seemed
to
understand
what
had
happened
,
and
resumed
his
employment
.
<EOS>
A
wide
-
spreading
yew
-
tree
grew
in
this
part
of
the
churchyard
,
and
near
it
stood
a
small
cross
rudely
carved
in
granite
,
marking
the
spot
where
,
in
the
reign
of
Henry
VI
.
,
Ralph
Cliderhow
,
tenth
abbot
of
Whalley
,
held
a
meeting
of
the
tenantry
,
to
check
encroachments
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
this
ancient
cross
the
sexton
,
a
hale
old
man
,
with
a
fresh
complexion
and
silvery
hair
,
was
at
work
,
and
while
the
others
went
on
,
Master
Potts
paused
to
say
a
word
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
funeral
here
to
-
day
,
I
suppose
,
Master
Sexton
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh

"
replied
the
man
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
One

inquired
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw

replied
the

<EOS>
"
Where

"
<EOS>
persevered
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
The
sexton
seemed
disinclined
to
answer
;
but
at
length
said
,
"

<EOS>
and
he
brushed
the
dew
from
his
eyes
with
his
brawny
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was

"
asked
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"

asked
Potts
,
whose
curiosity
began
to
be
aroused
.
 
<EOS>
"
Becose--

replied
the
sexton
,
and
he
stopped
suddenly
short
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
bewitched

"
suggested
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
The
sexton
nodded
his
head
,
and
began
to
ply
his
mattock
vigorously
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
Mother
Demdike
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Potts
,
taking
out
his
memorandum
book
.
 
<EOS>
The
sexton
again
nodded
his
head
,
but
spake
no
word
,
and
,
meeting
some
obstruction
in
the
ground
,
took
up
his
pick
to
remove
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another

<EOS>
muttered
Potts
,
making
an
entry
.

"

replied
Potts

<EOS>
And
having
obtained
all
he
required
,
he
proceeded
to
the
little
hostel
,
where
,
finding
the
rest
of
the
party
had
dismounted

he
consigned
Flint

entered

CHAPTER
V.--BESS
<EOS>
'S
<EOS>
O
'
TH
'
BOOTH
.
  
<EOS>
Bess
's
o
'
th
'
Booth
--
for
so
the
little
hostel
at
Goldshaw
was
called
,
after
its
mistress
Bess
Whitaker
--
was
far
more
comfortable
and
commodious
than
its
unpretending
exterior
seemed
to
warrant
.
<EOS>
Stouter
and
brighter
ale
was
not
to
be
drunk
in
Lancashire
than
Bess
brewed
;
nor
was
better
sherris
or
clary
to
be
found
,
go
where
you
would
,
than
in
her
cellars
.
<EOS>
The
traveller
crossing
those
dreary
wastes
,
and
riding
from
Burnley
to
Clithero
,
or
from
Colne
to
Whalley
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
might
well
halt
at
Bess
's
,
and
be
sure
of
a
roast
fowl
for
dinner
,
with
the
addition
,
perhaps
,
of
some
trout
from
Pendle
Water
,
or
,
if
the
season
permitted
,
a
heath
-
cock
or
a
pheasant
;
or
,
if
he
tarried
there
for
the
night
,
he
was
equally
sure
of
a
good
supper
and
fair
linen
.
<EOS>
It
has
already
been
mentioned
,
that
at
this
period
it
was
the
custom
of
all
classes
in
the
northern
counties
,
men
and
women
,
to
resort
to
the
alehouses
to
drink
,
and
the
hostel
at
Goldshaw
was
the
general
rendezvous
of
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
For
those
who
could
afford
it
Bess
would
brew
incomparable
sack
;
but
if
a
guest
called
for
wine
,
and
she
liked
not
his
looks
,
she
would
flatly
tell
him
her
ale
was
good
enough
for
him
,
and
if
it
pleased
him
not
he
should
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
Submission
always
followed
in
such
cases
,
for
there
was
no
disputing
with
Bess
.
<EOS>
Neither
would
she
permit
the
frequenters
of
the
hostel
to
sit
later
than
she
chose
,
and
would
clear
the
house
in
a
way
equally
characteristic
and
effectual
.
<EOS>
At
a
certain
hour
,
and
that
by
no
means
a
late
one
,
she
would
take
down
a
large
horsewhip
,
which
hung
on
a
convenient
peg
in
the
principal
room
,
and
after
bluntly
ordering
her
guests
to
go
home
,
if
any
resistance
were
offered
,
she
would
lay
the
whip
across
their
shoulders
,
and
forcibly
eject
them
from
the
premises
;
but
,
as
her
determined
character
was
well
known
,
this
violence
was
seldom
necessary
.
<EOS>
In
strength
Bess
was
a
match
for
any
man
,
and
assistance
from
her
cowherds
--
for
she
was
a
farmer
as
well
as
hostess
<EOS>
--
was
at
hand
if
required
.
<EOS>
As
will
be
surmised
from
the
above
,
Bess
was
large
and
masculine
-
looking
,
but
well
-
proportioned
nevertheless
,
and
possessed
a
certain
coarse
kind
of
beauty
,
which
in
earlier
years
had
inflamed
Richard
Baldwyn
,
the
miller
of
Rough
Lee
,
who
made
overtures
of
marriage
to
her
.
<EOS>
These
were
favourably
entertained
,
but
a
slight
quarrel
occurring
between
them
,
the
lover
,
in
her
own
phrase
,
got
"
his
jacket
soundly
dusted
"
by
her
,
and
declared
off
,
taking
to
wife
a
more
docile
and
light
-
handed
maiden
.
<EOS>
As
to
Bess
,
though
she
had
given
this
unmistakable
proof
of
her
ability
to
manage
a
husband
,
she
did
not
receive
a
second
offer
,
nor
,
as
she
had
now
attained
the
mature
age
of
forty
,
did
it
seem
likely
she
would
ever
receive
one
.
 
<EOS>
Bess
's
o
'
th
'
Booth
was
an
extremely
clean
and
comfortable
house
.
<EOS>
The
floor
,
it
is
true
,
was
of
hard
clay
,
and
the
windows
little
more
than
narrow
slits
,
with
heavy
stone
frames
,
further
darkened
by
minute
diamond
panes
;
but
the
benches
were
scrupulously
clean
,
and
so
was
the
long
oak
table
in
the
centre
of
the
principal
and
only
large
room
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
A
roundabout
fireplace
occupied
one
end
of
the
chamber
,
sheltered
from
the
draught
of
the
door
by
a
dark
oak
screen
,
with
a
bench
on
the
warm
side
of
it
;
and
here
,
or
in
the
deep
ingle
-
nooks
,
on
winter
nights
,
the
neighbours
would
sit
and
chat
by
the
blazing
hearth
,
discussing
pots
of
"
nappy
ale
,
good
and
stale
,
"
as
the
old
ballad
hath
it
;
and
as
persons
of
both
sexes
came
thither
,
young
as
well
as
old
,
many
a
match
was
struck
up
by
Bess
's
cheery
fireside
.
<EOS>
From
the
blackened
rafters
hung
a
goodly
supply
of
hams
,
sides
of
bacon
,
and
dried
tongues
,
with
a
profusion
of
oatcakes
in
a
bread
-
flake
;
while
,
in
case
this
store
should
be
exhausted
,
means
of
replenishment
were
at
hand
in
the
huge
,
full
-
crammed
meal
-
chest
standing
in
one
corner
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
there
was
a
look
of
abundance
as
well
as
of
comfort
about
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Great
was
Bess
's
consternation
when
the
poor
pedlar
,
who
had
quitted
her
house
little
more
than
an
hour
ago
,
full
of
health
and
spirits
,
was
brought
back
to
it
in
such
a
deplorable
condition
;
and
when
she
saw
him
deposited
at
her
door
,
notwithstanding
her
masculine
character
,
she
had
some
difficulty
in
repressing
a
scream
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
however
,
yield
to
the
weakness
,
but
seeing
at
once
what
was
best
to
be
done
,
caused
him
to
be
transported
by
the
grooms
to
the
chamber
he
had
occupied
over
-
night
,
and
laid
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Medical
assistance
was
fortunately
at
hand
;
for
it
chanced
that
Master
Sudall
,
the
chirurgeon
of
Colne
,
was
in
the
house
at
the
time
,
having
been
brought
to
Goldshaw
by
the
great
sickness
that
prevailed
at
Sabden
and
elsewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Sudall
was
immediately
in
attendance
upon
the
sufferer
,
and
bled
him
copiously
,
after
which
the
poor
man
seemed
much
easier
;
and
Richard
Assheton
,
taking
the
chirurgeon
aside
,
asked
his
opinion
of
the
case
,
and
was
told
by
Sudall
that
he
did
not
think
the
pedlar
's
life
in
danger
,
but
he
doubted
whether
he
would
ever
recover
the
use
of
his
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
attribute
the
attack
to
witchcraft
,
I
suppose
,
Master
Sudall
?
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to
deliver
an
opinion
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
decide
,
when
all
the
appearances
are
precisely
like
those
of
an
ordinary
attack
of
paralysis
.
<EOS>
But
a
sad
case
has
recently
come
under
my
observation
,
as
to
which
I
can
have
no
doubt
--
<EOS>
I
mean
as
to
its
being
the
result
of
witchcraft
--
but
I
will
tell
you
more
about
it
presently
,
for
I
must
now
return
to
my
patient
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
being
agreed
among
the
party
to
rest
for
an
hour
at
the
little
hostel
,
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
,
Nicholas
went
to
look
after
the
horses
,
while
Roger
Nowell
and
Richard
remained
in
the
room
with
the
pedlar
.
<EOS>
Bess
Whitaker
owned
an
extensive
farm
-
yard
,
provided
with
cow
-
houses
,
stables
,
and
a
large
barn
;
and
it
was
to
the
latter
place
that
the
two
grooms
proposed
to
repair
with
Sparshot
and
play
a
game
at
loggats
on
the
clay
floor
.
<EOS>
No
one
knew
what
had
become
of
the
reeve
;
for
,
on
depositing
the
poor
pedlar
at
the
door
of
the
hostel
,
he
had
mounted
his
horse
and
ridden
away
.
<EOS>
Having
ordered
some
fried
eggs
and
bacon
,
Nicholas
wended
his
way
to
the
stable
,
while
Bess
,
assisted
by
a
stout
kitchen
wench
,
busied
herself
in
preparing
the
eatables
,
and
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
Master
Potts
entered
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Bess
eyed
him
narrowly
,
and
was
by
no
means
prepossessed
by
his
looks
,
while
the
muddy
condition
of
his
habiliments
did
not
tend
to
exalt
him
in
her
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo

"
she
observed
,
as
the
attorney
seated
himself
on
the
bench
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
rejoined
Potts
;
"
where
should
a
man
make
himself
at
home
,
if
not
at
an
inn
?
<EOS>
Those
eggs
and
bacon
look
very
tempting
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
some
presently
;
and
,
as
soon
as
you
've
done
with
the
frying

I

<EOS>
"
I

replied
Potts
,
"

have
no

<EOS>
But
what

"
 
<EOS>
"
Sherris

replied
Bess

<EOS>
"
Sherris

echoed
Potts
,
"

yet
you

I

<EOS>
Get

some
sugar

eggs

I
'll

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
Set

cried
Bess
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you

<EOS>
"
said
Potts
,
staring
at
her
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
to
fetch

I
now

<EOS>
"

Potts

<EOS>
"
Let

I
am
not

I

If

<EOS>
And
he
filled
a
flagon
near
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
yo
dun

yo
shan

said
Bess
,
putting
aside
the
frying

pan
and
taking
down
the
horsewhip
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

I

replied
Potts
merrily
;
"
you

<EOS>
"
Ey'n

cried
Bess

<EOS>
And
,
catching
the
attorney
by
the
collar
,
she
began
to
belabour
him
soundly
with
the
whip
.
 
<EOS>
"
Holloa

<EOS>
"
Why

<EOS>
this

cried
the

"
Help

<EOS>
roared
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Nicholas
returned
from
the
stables
,
and
,
seeing
how
matters
stood
,
flew
to
the
attorney
's
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come

Unluckily

he

pitched
into

No

cried

snatching
up
his
horsewhip

he
had
dropped
in

previous
scuffle

brandishing
it
fiercely

<EOS>
"
I

Nicholas
was
obliged
once
more
to
interfere

as
he
passed
his
arms
round
the
hostess

he
thought
a

"
Come

Nicholas
;

the

clapping

And
while
Bess
attended

these
requirements

he
observed

<EOS>
"
True

Bess

"
replied
the
squire
,
"
and
the
best
plan
therefore
is
,
to
make
the
most
of

<EOS>
So
brew

<EOS>
And
while
the
hostess
proceeded
to
prepare
the
sack
,
Potts
remarked
to
Nicholas
,

emptying
the

into
a

placing
the

on
the
fire

<EOS>

addressing
her

"

Bess
;

<EOS>

Then

<EOS>
cried
Potts,--"butter

,
and
milk
from

,
ale
and
wine

cellar

replied
Bess
,
adding
eggs
,
sugar
,
and
spice
to
the
now
boiling
wine
,
and
stirring
up
the
compound
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
where
your
brother
,
the
reeve
of
the
forest
,
can
be
,
Master
Potts
!
"
<EOS>
observed
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
see
either
him
or
his
horse
at
the
stables
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
the
arch
impostor
has
taken
himself
off
altogether

"
said
Potts
;
"
and
if
so
,
I
shall
be
sorry
,
for
I
have
not
done
with
him

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
sack
was
now
set
before
them
,
and
pronounced
excellent
,
and
while
they
were
engaged
in
discussing
it
,
together
with
a
fresh
supply
of
eggs
and
bacon
,
fried
by
the
kitchen
wench
,
Roger
Nowell
came
out
of
the
inner
room
,
accompanied
by
Richard
and
the
chirurgeon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Master
Sudall
,
how
goes
on
your
patient
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Nicholas
of
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
more
favourably
than
I
expected
,
squire
,
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
better
left
alone
for
awhile
,
and
,
as
I
shall
not
quit
the
village
till
evening

I
shall
be
able

look
well
after
him

<EOS>
"
You

attack
occasioned
by
witchcraft
of
course

sir

"
said
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
poor
fellow
affirms
it
to
be
so
,
but
I
can
give
no
opinion
,
"
replied
Sudall
,
evasively
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
make
up
your
mind
as
to
the
matter

for
I
think
it
right
to
tell
you
your
evidence
will
be
required

"
said
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
you
may
have
seen
poor
Mary
Baldwyn

the
miller
's
daughter
of
Rough
Lee
,
and
can
speak
more
positively
as
to
her
case
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
,
seating
himself
beside
Potts
,
while
Roger
Nowell
and
Richard
placed
themselves
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
case
I
referred
to
a
short
time
ago
,
when
answering
your
inquiries
on
the
same
subject
,
Master
Richard
,
and
a
most
afflicting
one
it
is
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
have
the
particulars
.
<EOS>
Six
months
ago
,
Mary
Baldwyn
was
as
lovely
and
blooming
a
lass
as
could
be
seen
,
the
joy
of
her
widowed
father
's
heart
.
<EOS>
A
hot
-
headed
,
obstinate
man
is
Richard
Baldwyn
,
and
he
was
unwise
enough
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
Mother
Demdike
,
by
favouring
her
rival
,
old
Chattox
,
to
whom
he
gave
flour
and
meal
,
while
he
refused
the
same
tribute
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
first
time
Mother
Demdike
was
dismissed
without
the
customary
dole
,
one
of
his
millstones
broke
,
and
,
instead
of
taking
this
as
a
warning
,
he
became
more
obstinate
.
<EOS>
She
came
a
second
time
,
and
he
sent
her
away
with
curses
.
<EOS>
Then
all
his
flour
grew
damp
and
musty
,
and
no
one
would
buy
it
.
<EOS>
Still
he
remained
obstinate
,
and
,
when
she
appeared
again
,
he
would
have
laid
hands
upon
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
raised
her
staff
,
and
the
blows
fell
short
.
'
<EOS>
I
have
given
thee
two
warnings
,
Richard
,
'
she
said
,
'
and
thou
hast
paid
no
heed
to
them
.
<EOS>
Now
I
will
make
thee
smart
,
lad
,
in
right
earnest
.
<EOS>
That
which
thou
lovest
best
thou
shalt
lose
.
'
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
bethinking
him
that
the
dearest
thing
he
had
in
the
world
was
his
daughter
Mary
,
and
afraid
of
harm
happening
to
her
,
Richard
would
fain
have
made
up
his
quarrel
with
the
old
witch
;
but
it
had
now
gone
too
far
,
and
she
would
not
listen
to
him
,
but
uttering
some
words
,
with
which
the
name
of
the
girl
was
mingled
,
shook
her
staff
at
the
house
and
departed
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
poor
Mary
was
taken
ill
,
and
her
father
,
in
despair
,
applied
to
old
Chattox
,
who
promised
him
help
,
and
did
her
best
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
--
for
she
would
have
willingly
thwarted
her
rival
,
and
robbed
her
of
her
prey
;
but
the
latter
was
too
strong
for
her
,
and
the
hapless
victim
got
daily
worse
and
worse
.
<EOS>
Her
blooming
cheek
grew
white
and
hollow
,
her
dark
eyes
glistened
with
unnatural
lustre
,
and
she
was
seen
no
more
on
the
banks
of
Pendle
water
.
<EOS>
Before
this
my
aid
had
been
called
in
by
the
afflicted
father
--
and
I
did
all
I
could
--
but
I
knew
she
would
die
--
and
I
told
him
so
.
<EOS>
The
information
I
feared
had
killed
him
,
for
he
fell
down
like
a
stone
--
and
I
repented
having
spoken
.
<EOS>
However
he
recovered
,
and
made
a
last
appeal
to
Mother
Demdike
;
but
the
unrelenting
hag
derided
him
and
cursed
him
,
telling
him
if
he
brought
her
all
his
mill
contained
,
and
added
to
that
all
his
substance
,
she
would
not
spare
his
child
.
<EOS>
He
returned
heart
-
broken
,
and
never
quitted
the
poor
girl
's
bedside
till
she
breathed
her
last
.
"

"
said
Bess
,
whose
tears
had
flowed
freely
during
the
narration
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
wellnigh
crazed
with
grief
,
"
said
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
commit
no
rash
act
.
"
 
<EOS>
Expressions
of
deep
commiseration
for
the
untimely
death
of
the
miller
's
daughter
had
been
uttered
by
all
the
party
,
and
they
were
talking
over
the
strange
circumstances
attending
it
,
when
they
were
roused
by
the
trampling
of
horses
'
feet
at
the
door
,
and
the
moment
after
,
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
clad
in
deep
mourning
,
but
put
on
in
a
manner
that
betrayed
the
disorder
of
his
mind
,
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
His
looks
were
wild
and
frenzied
,
his
cheeks
haggard
,
and
he
rushed
into
the
room
so
abruptly
that
he
did
not
at
first
observe
the
company
assembled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Richard
Baldwyn
,
is
that

"
cried
the
chirurgeon
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>

father
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Potts
,
taking
out
his
memorandum
-
book
;
"
I
must
prepare
to
interrogate
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sit

said
Bess
,
taking
his

kindly
,
and
leading

to
a
bench
.

cried
the
miller
,
rising
suddenly
,
and
stamping
his
foot
on
the
ground,--"that

<EOS>

<EOS>
right
--
<EOS>
my
good
friend
--
an
excellent
resolution
--

to
the
stake
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
enthusiasm
was
suddenly
checked
by
observing
the
reeve
of
the
forest
peeping
from
behind
the
wainscot
,
and
earnestly
regarding
the
miller
,
and
he
called
the
attention
of
the
latter
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
Baldwyn
mechanically
followed
the
expressive
gestures
of
the
attorney,--but
<EOS>
he
saw
no
one
,
for
the
reeve
had
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
incident
passed
unnoticed
by
the
others
,
who
had
been
,
too
deeply
moved
by
poor
Baldwyn
's
outburst
of
grief
to
pay
attention
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
while
Bess
Whitaker
succeeded
in
prevailing
upon
the
miller
to
sit
down
,
and
when
he
became
more
composed
he
told
her
that
the
funeral
procession
,
consisting
of
some
of
his
neighbours
who
had
undertaken
to
attend
his
ill
-
fated
daughter
to
her
last
home
,
was
coming
from
Rough
Lee
to
Goldshaw
,
but
that
,
unable
to
bear
them
company
,
he
had
ridden
on
by
himself
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
also
,
from
his
muttered
threats
,
that
he
had
meditated
some
wild
project
of
vengeance
against
Mother
Demdike
,
which
he
intended
to
put
into
execution
,
before
the
day
was
over
;
but
Master
Potts
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
this
course
,
assuring
him
that
the
most
certain
and
efficacious
mode
of
revenge
he
could
adopt
would
be
through
the
medium
of
the
law
,
and
that
he
would
give
him
his
best
advice
and
assistance
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
talking
thus
,
the
bell
began
to
toll
,
and
every
stroke
seemed
to
vibrate
through
the
heart
of
the
afflicted
father
,
who
was
at
last
<EOS>
so
overpowered
by
grief
,
that
the
hostess
deemed
it
expedient
to
lead
him
into
an
inner
room
,
where
he
might
indulge
his
sorrow
unobserved
.
 
<EOS>
Without
awaiting
the
issue
of
this
painful
scene
,
Richard
,
who
was
much
affected
by
it
,
went
forth
,
and
taking
his
horse
from
the
stable
,
with
the
intention
of
riding
on
slowly
before
the
others
,
led
the
animal
towards
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
short
distance
of
the
grey
old
fabric
he
paused
.
<EOS>
The
bell
continued
to
toll
mournfully
,
and
deepened
the
melancholy
hue
of
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
The
sad
tale
he
had
heard
held
possession
of
his
mind
,
and
while
he
pitied
poor
Mary
Baldwyn
,
he
began
to
entertain
apprehensions
that
Alizon
might
meet
a
similar
fate
.
<EOS>
So
many
strange
circumstances
had
taken
place
during
the
morning
's
ride
;
he
had
listened
to
so
many
dismal
relations
,
that
,
coupled
with
the
dark
and
mysterious
events
of
the
previous
night
,
he
was
quite
bewildered
,
and
felt
oppressed
as
if
by
a
hideous
nightmare
,
which
it
was
impossible
to
shake
off
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
Mothers
Demdike
and
Chattox
.
<EOS>
Could
these
dread
beings
be
permitted
to
exercise
such
baneful
influence
over
mankind
?
<EOS>
With
all
the
apparent
proofs
of
their
power
he
had
received
,
he
still
strove
to
doubt
,
and
to
persuade
himself
that
the
various
cases
of
witchcraft
described
to
him
were
only
held
to
be
such
by
the
timid
and
the
credulous
.
 
<EOS>
Full
of
these
meditations
,
he
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
and
entered
the
churchyard
,
and
while
pursuing
a
path
shaded
by
a
row
of
young
lime
-
trees
leading
to
the
porch
,
he
perceived
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
near
the
cross
erected
by
Abbot
Cliderhow
,
two
persons
who
attracted
his
attention
.
<EOS>
One
was
the
sexton
,
who
was
now
deep
in
the
grave
;
and
the
other
an
old
woman
,
with
her
back
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Neither
had
remarked
his
approach
,
and
,
influenced
by
an
unaccountable
feeling
of
curiosity
,
he
stood
still
to
watch
their
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
the
sexton
,
who
was
shovelling
out
the
mould
,
paused
in
his
task
;
and
the
old
woman
,
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
which
seemed
familiar
to
the
listener
,
said
,
"
What
hast

Zachariah
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
I

"
replied
the
hag
,
"
but
first
I
must
have
my
funeral
rites
performed
--
ha

<EOS>

!
<EOS>
Bury

for

Zachariah

"
she
said
,
giving
him
a
small
clay
figure
.
<EOS>
"
Bury
it
deep
,
and
as
it
moulders
away
,
may
she
it

pine

"
 
<EOS>
"
An
whoam
doth

represent

<EOS>
"
asked
the
sexton
,
regarding
the
image
with
curiosity
.
"
<EOS>
Ey
dunna
knoa
the
feace
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
should
you
know
it
,
fool
,
since
you
have
never
seen
her
in
whose
likeness
it
is
made
?
"
replied
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
connected
with
the
race
I
hate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wi
'
the
Demdikes
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
sexton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
the
hag
,
"
with
the
Demdikes
.
<EOS>
She
passes
for
one
of
them
--
but
she
is
not
of
them
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
hate
her
as
though
she
were
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
dunna
mean
Alizon
Device
?
"
said
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
Ey

hearted

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mary
Baldwyn
,
who
will
soon
lie
there
,
was
quite
as
comely
and
kind
-
hearted
as
Alizon
,
"
cried
the
hag
,
"
and
yet
Mother
Demdike
had
no
pity
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
that
's
true
,
"
replied
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
Weel
,
weel
;
ey'n
do
your
bidding
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
suffer
this
abomination
to
be
practised
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
speaks
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
hag
,
turning
round
,
and
disclosing
the
hideous
countenance
of
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
voice
is
that
of
Richard
Assheton
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
Richard
Assheton
who
speaks
,
"
cried
the
young
man
,
"
and
I
command
you
to
desist
from
this
wickedness
.
<EOS>
Give
me
that
clay
image
,
"
he
cried
,
snatching
it
from
the
sexton
,
and
trampling
it
to
dust
beneath
his
feet
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
I
destroy
thy
impious
handiwork
,
and
defeat
thy
evil
intentions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
think'st
thou
<EOS>
so
,
lad
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
find
thyself
mistaken
.
<EOS>
My
curse
has
already
alighted
upon
thee
,
and
it
shall
work
.
<EOS>
Thou
lov'st
Alizon.--I
know
it
.
<EOS>
But
she
shall
never
be
thine
.
<EOS>
Now
,
go
thy
ways
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
,
"
<EOS>
replied
<EOS>
Richard--"but
<EOS>
you
shall
come
with
me
,
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dare
<EOS>
you
lay
hands
on
me
?
<EOS>
"
screamed
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
let
her
be
,
mester
,
"
interposed
the
sexton
,
"
yo
had
better
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
bad
as
she
is
,
"
said
Richard
,
"
and
deserve
equal
punishment
.
<EOS>
You
escaped
yesterday
at
Whalley
,
old
woman
,
but
you
shall
not
escape
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
not
too
sure
of
that
,
"
cried
the
hag
,
disabling
him
for
the
moment
,
by
a
severe
blow
on
the
arm
from
her
staff
.
<EOS>
And
shuffling
off
with
an
agility
which
could
scarcely
have
been
expected
from
her
,
she
passed
through
a
gate
near
her
,
and
disappeared
behind
a
high
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
would
have
followed
,
but
he
was
detained
by
the
sexton
,
who
besought
him
,
as
he
valued
his
life
,
not
to
interfere
,
and
when
at
last
he
broke
away
from
the
old
man
,
he
could
see
nothing
of
her
,
and
only
heard
the
sound
of
horses
'
feet
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
Either
his
eyes
deceived
him
,
or
at
a
turn
in
the
woody
lane
skirting
the
church
he
descried
the
reeve
of
the
forest
galloping
off
with
the
old
woman
behind
him
.
<EOS>
This
lane
led
towards
Rough
Lee
,
and
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
Richard
flew
to
the
spot
where
he
had
left
his
horse
,
and
,
mounting
him
,
rode
swiftly
along
it
.

CHAPTER
VI.--THE
TEMPTATION
.
  
<EOS>
Shortly
after
Richard
's
departure
,
a
round
,
rosy
-
faced
personage
,
whose
rusty
black
cassock
,
hastily
huddled
over
a
dark
riding
-
dress
,
proclaimed
him
a
churchman
,
entered
the
hostel
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
rector
of
Goldshaw
,
Parson
Holden
,
a
very
worthy
little
man
,
though
rather
,
perhaps
,
too
fond
of
the
sports
of
the
field
and
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
To
Roger
Nowell
and
Nicholas
Assheton
<EOS>
he
was
of
course
well
known
,
and
was
much
esteemed
by
the
latter
,
often
riding
over
to
hunt
and
fish
,
or
carouse
,
at
Downham
.
<EOS>
Parson
Holden
had
been
sent
for
by
Bess
to
administer
spiritual
consolation
to
poor
Richard
Baldwyn
,
who
she
thought
stood
in
need
of
it
,
and
having
respectfully
saluted
the
magistrate
,
of
whom
he
stood
somewhat
in
awe
,
and
shaken
hands
cordially
with
Nicholas
,
who
was
delighted
to
see
him
,
he
repaired
to
the
inner
room
,
promising
to
come
back
speedily
.
<EOS>
And
he
kept
his
word
;
for
in
less
than
five
minutes
he
reappeared
with
the
satisfactory
intelligence
that
the
afflicted
miller
was
considerably
calmer
,
and
had
listened
to
his
counsels
with
much
edification
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
him
a
glass
of
aquavitæ
,
Bess
,
"
he
said
to
the
hostess
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
evidently
a
cup
too
low
,
and
will
be
the
better
for
it
.
<EOS>
Strong
water
is
a
specific
I
always
recommend
under
such
circumstances
,
Master
Sudall
,
and
indeed
adopt
myself
,
and
I
am
sure
you
will
approve
of
it.--Harkee
,
Bess
,
when
you
have
ministered
to
poor
Baldwyn
's
wants
,
I
must
crave
your
attention
to
my
own
,
and
beg
you
to
fill
me
a
tankard
with
your
oldest
ale
,
and
toast
me
an
oatcake
to
eat
with
it.--I
must
keep
up
my
spirits
,
worthy
sir
,
"
he
added
to
Roger
Nowell
,
"
for
I
have
a
painful
duty
to
perform
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
been
more
shocked
than
by
the
death
of
poor
Mary
Baldwyn
.
<EOS>
A
fair
flower
,
and
early
nipped
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nipped
,
indeed
,
if
all
we
have
heard
be
correct
,
"
rejoined
Newell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
forest
is
in
a
sad
state
,
reverend
sir
.
<EOS>
It
would
seem
as
if
the
enemy
of
mankind
,
by
means
of
his
abominable
agents
,
were
permitted
to
exercise
uncontrolled
dominion
over
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
,
the
forlorn
condition
of
the
people
reflects
little
credit
on
those
who
have
them
in
charge
.
<EOS>
The
powers
of
darkness
could
never
have
prevailed
to
such
an
extent
if
duly
resisted
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
lament
to
hear
you
say
so
,
good
Master
Nowell
,
"
replied
the
rector
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
my
best
,
I
assure
you
,
to
keep
my
small
and
widely
-
scattered
flock
together
,
and
to
save
them
from
the
ravening
wolves
and
cunning
foxes
that
infest
the
country
;
and
if
now
and
then
some
sheep
have
gone
astray
,
or
a
poor
lamb
,
as
in
the
instance
of
Mary
Baldwyn
,
hath
fallen
a
victim
,
I
am
scarcely
to
blame
for
the
mischance
.
<EOS>
Rather
let
me
say
,
sir
,
that
you
,
as
an
active
and
zealous
magistrate
,
should
take
the
matter
in
hand
,
and
by
severe
dealing
with
the
offenders
,
arrest
the
progress
of
the
evil
.
<EOS>
No
defence
,
spiritual
or
otherwise
,
as
yet
set
up
against
them
,
has
proved
effectual
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Justly
remarked
,
reverend
sir
,
"
observed
Potts
,
looking
up
from
the
memorandum
book
in
which
he
was
writing
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
am
sure
your
advice
will
not
be
lost
upon
Master
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
As
regards
the
persons
who
may
be
afflicted
by
witchcraft
,
hath
not
<EOS>
our
sagacious
monarch
observed
,
that
'
There
are
three
kind
of
folks
who
may
be
tempted
or
troubled
:
the
wicked
for
their
horrible
sins
,
to
punish
them
in
the
like
measure
;
the
godly
that
are
sleeping
in
any
great
sins
or
infirmities
,
and
weakness
in
faith
,
to
waken
them
up
the
faster
by
such
an
uncouth
form
;
and
even
some
of
the
best
,
that
their
patience
may
be
tried
before
the
world
as
Job
's
was
tried
.
<EOS>
For
why
may
not
God
use
any
kind
of
extraordinary
punishment
,
when
it
pleases
Him
,
as
well
as
the
ordinary
rods
of
sickness
,
or
other
adversities
?
'
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
sir
,
"
replied
Holden
.
<EOS>
"
And
we
are
undergoing
this
severe
trial
now
.
<EOS>
Fortunate
are
they
who
profit
by
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
what
is
said
further
,
sir
,
by
the
king
,
"
pursued
Potts
.
"
<EOS>
'
No
man
,
'
declares
that
wise
prince
,
'
ought
to
presume
so
far
as
to
promise
any
impunity
to
himself
.
'
<EOS>
But
further
on
he
gives
us
courage
,
for
he
adds
,
'
<EOS>
and
yet
we
ought
not
to
be
afraid
for
that
,
of
any
thing
that
the
devil
and
his
wicked
instruments
can
do
against
us
,
for
we
daily
fight
against
him
in
a
hundred
other
ways
,
and
therefore
as
a
valiant
captain
affrays
no
more
being
at
the
combat
,
nor
stays
from
his
purpose
for
the
rummishing
shot
of
a
cannon
,
nor
the
small
clack
of
a
pistolet
;
<EOS>
not
being
certain
what
may
light
on
him
;
even
so
ought
we
boldly
to
go
forward
in
fighting
against
the
devil
without
any
greater
terror
,
for
these
his
rarest
weapons
,
than
the
ordinary
,
whereof
we
have
daily
the
proof
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
majesty
is
quite
right
,
"
observed
Holden
,
"
and
I
am
glad
to
hear
his
convincing
words
so
judiciously
cited
.
<EOS>
I
myself
have
no
fear
of
these
wicked
instruments
of
Satan
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
what
manner
,
may
I
ask
,
have
you
proved
your
courage
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
Have
you
preached
against
them
,
and
denounced
their
wickedness
,
menacing
them
with
the
thunders
of
the
Church
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
I
have
,
"
replied
Holden
,
rather
abashed
,
"
but
I
shall
henceforth
adopt
a
very
different
course.--Ah
!
<EOS>
here
comes
the
ale
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
taking
the
foaming
tankard
from
Bess
;
"
this
is
the
best
cordial
wherewith
to
sustain
one
's
courage
in
these
trying
times
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Some
remedy
must
be
found
for
this
intolerable
grievance
,
"
observed
Roger
Nowell
,
after
a
few
moments
'
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Till
this
morning
I
was
not
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
evil
,
but
supposed
that
the
two
malignant
hags
,
who
seem
to
reign
supreme
here
,
confined
their
operations
to
blighting
corn
,
maiming
cattle
,
turning
milk
sour
;
and
even
these
reports
I
fancied
were
greatly
exaggerated
;
but
I
now
find
,
from
what
I
have
seen
at
Sabden
and
elsewhere
,
that
they
fall
very
far
short
of
the
reality
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
difficult
to
increase
the
darkness
of
the
picture
,
"
said
the
chirurgeon
;
"
but
what
remedy
will
you
apply
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
cautery
,
sir
,
"
replied
Potts,--"the
actual
cautery
--
we
will
burn
out
this
plague
-
spot
.
<EOS>
The
two
old
hags
and
their
noxious
brood
shall
be
brought
to
the
stake
.
<EOS>
That
will
effect
a
radical
cure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
when
it
is
accomplished
,
but
I
fear
it
will
be
long
ere
that
happens
,
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
,
shaking
his
head
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
acquainted
with
Mother
Demdike
's
history
,
sir
?
"
he
added
to
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
part
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
"
but
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
any
thing
you
may
have
to
bring
forward
on
the
subject
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
peculiarity
in
her
case
,
"
observed
Sudall
,
"
and
the
circumstance
distinguishing
her
dark
and
dread
career
from
that
of
all
other
witches
is
,
that
it
has
been
shaped
out
by
destiny
.
<EOS>
When
an
infant
,
a
malediction
was
pronounced
upon
her
head
by
the
unfortunate
Abbot
Paslew
.
<EOS>
She
is
also
the
offspring
of
a
man
reputed
to
have
bartered
his
soul
to
the
Enemy
of
Mankind
,
while
her
mother
was
a
witch
.
<EOS>
Both
parents
perished
lamentably
,
about
the
time
of
Paslew
's
execution
at
Whalley
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
their
miserable
infant
did
not
perish
with
them
,
"
observed
Holden
.
<EOS>
"
How
much
crime
and
misery
would
have
been
spared
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
otherwise
ordained
,
"
replied
Sudall
.
<EOS>
"
Bereft
of
her
parents
in
this
way
,
the
infant
was
taken
charge
of
and
reared
by
Dame
Croft
,
the
miller
's
wife
of
Whalley
;
but
even
in
those
early
days
she
exhibited
such
a
malicious
and
vindictive
disposition
,
and
became
so
unmanageable
,
that
the
good
dame
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
her
,
and
sent
her
into
the
forest
,
where
she
found
a
home
at
Rough
Lee
,
then
occupied
by
Miles
Nutter
,
the
grandfather
of
the
late
Richard
Nutter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
exclaimed
Potts
,
"
was
Mother
Demdike
so
early
connected
with
that
family
?
<EOS>
I
must
make
a
note
of
that
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
remained
at
Rough
Lee
for
some
years
,
"
returned
Sudall
,
"
and
though
accounted
of
an
ill
disposition
,
there
was
nothing
to
be
alleged
against
her
at
the
time
;
though
afterwards
,
it
was
said
,
that
some
mishaps
that
befell
the
neighbours
were
owing
to
her
agency
,
and
that
she
was
always
attended
by
a
familiar
in
the
form
of
a
rat
or
a
mole
.
<EOS>
Whether
this
were
so
or
not
,
I
can
not
say
;
but
it
is
certain
that
she
helped
Miles
Nutter
to
get
rid
of
his
wife
,
and
procured
him
a
second
spouse
,
in
return
for
which
services
he
bestowed
upon
her
an
old
ruined
tower
on
his
domains
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
Malkin
Tower
?
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Malkin
Tower
,
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
legend
connected
with
that
structure
,
which
I
will
relate
to
you
anon
,
if
you
desire
it
.
<EOS>
But
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
Bess
Demdike
taken
up
her
abode
in
this
lone
tower
,
than
it
began
to
be
rumoured
that
she
was
a
witch
,
and
attended
sabbaths
on
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
,
and
on
Rimington
Moor
.
<EOS>
Few
would
consort
with
her
,
and
ill
-
luck
invariably
attended
those
with
whom
she
quarrelled
.
<EOS>
Though
of
hideous
and
forbidding
aspect
,
and
with
one
eye
lower
set
than
the
other
,
she
had
subtlety
enough
to
induce
a
young
man
named
Sothernes
to
marry
her
,
and
two
children
,
a
son
and
a
daughter
,
were
the
fruit
of
the
union
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
daughter
I
have
seen
at
Whalley
,
"
observed
Potts
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
have
never
encountered
the
son
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Christopher
Demdike
still
lives
,
I
believe
,
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
,
"
though
what
has
become
of
him
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
for
he
has
quitted
these
parts
.
<EOS>
He
is
as
ill
-
reputed
as
his
mother
,
and
has
the
same
strange
and
fearful
look
about
the
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
recognise
him
if
I
see
him
,
"
observed
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
scarcely
likely
to
meet
him
,
"
returned
Sudall
,
"
for
,
as
I
have
said
,
he
has
left
the
forest
.
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
my
story
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
state
was
little
suitable
to
Bess
Demdike
,
and
in
five
years
she
contrived
to
free
herself
from
her
husband
's
restraint
,
and
ruled
alone
in
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Her
malignant
influence
now
began
to
be
felt
throughout
the
whole
district
,
and
by
dint
of
menaces
and
positive
acts
of
mischief
,
she
extorted
all
she
required
.
<EOS>
Whosoever
refused
her
requests
speedily
experienced
her
resentment
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
in
the
fulness
of
her
power
,
a
rival
sprang
up
in
the
person
of
Anne
Whittle
,
since
known
by
the
name
of
Chattox
,
which
she
obtained
in
marriage
,
and
this
woman
disputed
Bess
Demdike
's
supremacy
.
<EOS>
Each
strove
to
injure
the
adherents
of
her
rival
--
and
terrible
was
the
mischief
they
wrought
.
<EOS>
In
the
end
,
however
,
Mother
Demdike
got
the
upper
hand
.
<EOS>
Years
have
flown
over
the
old
hag
's
head
,
and
her
guilty
career
has
been
hitherto
attended
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
Plans
have
been
formed
to
bring
her
to
justice
,
but
they
have
ever
failed
.
<EOS>
And
so
in
the
case
of
old
Chattox
.
<EOS>
Her
career
has
been
as
baneful
and
as
successful
as
that
of
Mother
Demdike
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
their
course
is
wellnigh
run
,
"
said
Potts
,
"
and
the
time
is
come
for
the
extirpation
of
the
old
serpents
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
who
is
that
at
the
window
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Sudall
;
"
but
that
you
are
sitting
near
me
,
I
should
declare
you
were
looking
in
at
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
Master
Potts
's
brother
,
the
reeve
of
the
forest
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
him
not
,
"
cried
the
attorney
,
angrily
,
"
but
let
us
have
the
promised
legend
of
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Willingly
!
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
.
"
<EOS>
But
before
I
begin
I
must
recruit
myself
with
a
can
of
ale
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
flagon
being
set
before
him
,
Sudall
commenced
his
story
:
     
<EOS>
The
Legend
of
Malkin
Tower
.
     
<EOS>
"
On
the
brow
of
a
high
hill
forming
part
of
the
range
of
    
Pendle
,
and
commanding
an
extensive
view
over
the
forest
,
and
    
the
wild
and
mountainous
region
around
it
,
stands
a
stern
    
solitary
tower
.
<EOS>
Old
as
the
Anglo
-
Saxons
,
and
built
as
a
    
stronghold
by
Wulstan
,
a
Northumbrian
thane
,
in
the
time
of
    
Edmund
or
Edred
,
it
is
circular
in
form
and
very
lofty
,
and
    
serves
as
a
landmark
to
the
country
round
.
<EOS>
Placed
high
up
in
    
the
building
<EOS>
the
door
was
formerly
reached
by
a
steep
flight
    
of
stone
steps
,
but
these
were
removed
some
fifty
or
sixty
    
years
ago
by
Mother
Demdike
,
and
a
ladder
capable
of
being
    
raised
or
let
down
at
pleasure
substituted
for
them
,
    
affording
the
only
apparent
means
of
entrance
.
<EOS>
The
tower
is
    
otherwise
inaccessible
,
the
walls
being
of
immense
thickness
,
    
with
no
window
lower
than
five
-
and
-
twenty
feet
from
the
    
ground
,
though
it
is
thought
there
must
be
a
secret
outlet
;
    
for
the
old
witch
,
when
she
wants
to
come
forth
,
does
not
    
wait
for
the
ladder
to
be
let
down
.
<EOS>
But
this
may
be
otherwise
    
explained
.
<EOS>
Internally
there
are
three
floors
,
the
lowest
    
being
placed
on
a
level
with
the
door
,
and
this
is
the
    
apartment
chiefly
occupied
by
the
hag
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
this
    
room
is
a
trapdoor
opening
upon
a
deep
vault
,
which
forms
the
    
basement
story
of
the
structure
,
and
which
was
once
used
as
a
    
dungeon
,
but
is
now
tenanted
,
it
is
said
,
by
a
fiend
,
who
can
    
be
summoned
by
the
witch
on
stamping
her
foot
.
<EOS>
Round
the
room
    
<EOS>
runs
a
gallery
contrived
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
,
while
    
the
upper
chambers
are
gained
by
a
secret
staircase
,
and
    
closed
by
movable
stones
,
the
machinery
of
which
is
only
    
known
to
the
inmate
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
All
the
rooms
are
lighted
    
by
narrow
loopholes
.
<EOS>
Thus
you
will
see
that
the
fortress
is
    
still
capable
of
sustaining
a
siege
,
and
old
Demdike
has
been
    
heard
to
declare
that
she
would
hold
it
for
a
month
against
a
    
hundred
men
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
it
has
proved
impregnable
.
     
<EOS>
"
On
the
Norman
invasion
,
Malkin
Tower
was
held
by
Ughtred
,
a
    
descendant
of
Wulstan
,
who
kept
possession
of
Pendle
Forest
    
and
the
hills
around
it
,
and
successfully
resisted
the
    
aggressions
of
the
conquerors
.
<EOS>
His
enemies
affirmed
he
was
    
assisted
by
a
demon
,
whom
he
had
propitiated
by
some
fearful
    
sacrifice
made
in
the
tower
,
and
the
notion
seemed
borne
out
    
by
the
success
uniformly
attending
his
conflicts
.
<EOS>
Ughtred
's
    
prowess
was
stained
by
cruelty
and
rapine
.
<EOS>
Merciless
in
the
    
treatment
of
his
captives
,
putting
them
to
death
by
horrible
    
tortures
,
or
immuring
them
in
the
dark
and
noisome
dungeon
of
    
his
tower
<EOS>
,
he
would
hold
his
revels
over
their
heads
,
and
    
deride
their
groans
.
<EOS>
Heaps
of
treasure
,
obtained
by
pillage
,
    
were
secured
by
him
in
the
tower
.
<EOS>
From
his
frequent
acts
of
    
treachery
,
and
the
many
foul
murders
he
perpetrated
,
Ughtred
    
was
styled
the
'
Scourge
of
the
Normans
.
'
<EOS>
For
a
long
period
he
    
enjoyed
complete
immunity
from
punishment
;
but
after
the
    
siege
of
York
,
and
the
defeat
of
the
insurgents
,
his
    
destruction
was
vowed
by
Ilbert
de
Lacy
,
lord
of
    
Blackburnshire
,
and
this
fierce
chieftain
set
fire
to
part
of
    
the
forest
in
which
the
Saxon
thane
and
his
followers
were
    
concealed
;
drove
them
to
Malkin
Tower
;
took
it
after
an
    
obstinate
and
prolonged
defence
,
and
considerable
loss
to
    
himself
,
and
put
them
all
to
the
sword
,
except
the
leader
,
    
whom
he
hanged
from
the
top
of
his
own
fortress
.
<EOS>
In
the
    
dungeon
were
found
many
carcasses
,
and
the
greater
part
of
    
Ughtred
's
treasure
served
to
enrich
the
victor
.
     
<EOS>
"
Once
again
,
in
the
reign
of
Henry
VI
.
,
Malkin
Tower
became
a
    
robber
's
stronghold
,
and
gave
protection
to
a
freebooter
    
named
Blackburn
,
who
,
with
a
band
of
daring
and
desperate
    
marauders
,
took
advantage
of
the
troubled
state
of
the
    
country
,
ravaged
it
far
and
wide
,
and
committed
unheard
of
    
atrocities
,
even
levying
contributions
upon
the
Abbeys
of
    
Whalley
and
Salley
,
and
the
heads
of
these
religious
    
establishments
were
glad
to
make
terms
with
him
to
save
their
    
herds
and
stores
,
the
rather
that
all
attempts
to
dislodge
    
him
from
his
mountain
fastness
,
and
destroy
his
band
,
had
    
failed
.
<EOS>
Blackburn
seemed
to
enjoy
the
same
kind
of
protection
    
as
Ughtred
,
and
practised
the
same
atrocities
,
torturing
and
    
imprisoning
his
captives
unless
they
were
heavily
ransomed
.
    
<EOS>
He
also
led
a
life
of
wildest
licence
,
and
,
when
not
engaged
    
in
some
predatory
exploit
,
spent
his
time
in
carousing
with
    
his
followers
.
     
<EOS>
"
Upon
one
occasion
it
chanced
that
he
made
a
visit
in
    
disguise
to
Whalley
Abbey
,
and
,
passing
the
little
hermitage
    
near
the
church
,
beheld
the
votaress
who
tenanted
it
.
<EOS>
This
    
was
Isole
de
Heton
.
<EOS>
Ravished
by
her
wondrous
beauty
,
    
Blackburn
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
making
his
passion
    
known
to
her
,
and
his
handsome
though
fierce
lineaments
    
pleasing
her
,
he
did
not
long
sigh
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
frequently
    
visited
her
in
the
garb
of
a
Cistertian
monk
,
and
,
being
    
taken
for
one
of
the
brethren
,
his
conduct
brought
great
    
scandal
upon
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
The
abandoned
votaress
bore
him
a
    
daughter
,
and
the
infant
was
conveyed
away
by
the
lover
,
and
    
placed
under
the
care
of
a
peasant
's
wife
,
at
Barrowford
.
    
<EOS>
From
that
child
sprung
Bess
Blackburn
,
the
mother
of
old
    
Demdike
;
so
that
the
witch
is
a
direct
descendant
of
Isole
de
    
Heton
.
     
<EOS>
"
Notwithstanding
all
precautions
,
Isole
's
dark
offence
became
    
known
,
and
she
would
have
paid
the
penalty
of
it
at
the
    
stake
,
if
she
had
not
fled
.
<EOS>
In
scaling
Whalley
Nab
,
in
the
    
woody
heights
of
which
she
was
to
remain
concealed
till
her
    
lover
could
come
to
her
,
she
fell
from
a
rock
,
shattering
her
    
limbs
,
and
disfiguring
her
features
.
<EOS>
Some
say
she
was
lamed
    
for
life
,
and
became
as
hideous
as
she
had
heretofore
been
    
lovely
;
but
this
is
erroneous
,
for
apprehensive
of
such
a
    
result
,
attended
by
the
loss
of
her
lover
,
she
invoked
the
    
powers
of
darkness
,
and
proffered
her
soul
in
return
for
five
    
years
of
unimpaired
beauty
.
     
<EOS>
"
The
compact
was
made
,
and
when
Blackburn
came
he
found
her
    
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Enraptured
,
he
conveyed
her
to
    
Malkin
Tower
,
and
lived
with
her
there
in
security
,
laughing
    
to
scorn
the
menaces
of
Abbot
Eccles
,
by
whom
he
was
    
excommunicated
.
     
<EOS>
"
Time
went
on
,
and
as
Isole
's
charms
underwent
no
change
,
her
    
lover
's
ardour
continued
unabated
.
<EOS>
Five
years
passed
in
    
guilty
pleasures
,
and
the
last
day
of
the
allotted
term
    
arrived
.
<EOS>
No
change
was
manifest
in
Isole
's
demeanour
;
neither
    
remorse
nor
fear
were
exhibited
by
her
.
<EOS>
Never
had
she
    
appeared
more
lovely
,
never
in
higher
or
more
exuberant
    
spirits
.
<EOS>
She
besought
her
lover
,
who
was
still
madly
    
intoxicated
by
her
infernal
charms
,
to
give
a
banquet
that
    
night
to
ten
of
his
trustiest
followers
.
<EOS>
He
willingly
    
assented
,
and
bade
them
to
the
feast
.
<EOS>
They
ate
and
drank
    
merrily
,
and
the
gayest
of
the
company
was
the
lovely
Isole
.
    
<EOS>
Her
spirits
seemed
somewhat
too
wild
even
to
Blackburn
,
but
    
he
did
not
check
her
,
though
surprised
at
the
excessive
    
liveliness
and
freedom
of
her
sallies
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
flashed
like
    
fire
,
and
there
was
not
a
man
present
but
was
madly
in
love
    
with
her
,
and
ready
to
dispute
for
her
smiles
with
his
    
captain
.
     
<EOS>
"
The
wine
flowed
freely
,
and
song
and
jest
went
on
till
    
midnight
.
<EOS>
When
the
hour
struck
,
Isole
filled
a
cup
to
the
    
brim
,
and
called
upon
them
to
pledge
her
.
<EOS>
All
arose
,
and
    
drained
their
goblets
enthusiastically
.
'
<EOS>
It
was
a
farewell
    
cup
,
'
she
said
;
'
I
am
going
away
with
one
of
you
.
'
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
How
!
'
    
exclaimed
Blackburn
,
in
angry
surprise
.
'
<EOS>
Let
any
one
but
    
touch
your
hand
,
and
I
will
strike
him
dead
at
my
feet
.

<EOS>
The
    
rest
of
the
company
regarded
each
other
with
surprise
,
and
it
    
was
then
discovered
that
a
stranger
was
amongst
them
;
a
tall
    
dark
man
,
whose
looks
were
so
terrible
and
demoniacal
that
no
    
one
dared
lay
hands
upon
him
.

I
am
come
,
'
he
said
,
with
    
fearful
significance
,
to
Isole
.
'
<EOS>
And
I
am
ready
,
'
she
    
answered
boldly
.
'
<EOS>
I
will
go
with
you
<EOS>
were
it
to
the
    
bottomless
pit
,
'
cried
Blackburn
catching
hold
of
her
.
'
<EOS>
It
is
    
thither
I
am
going
,
'
she
answered
with
a
scream
of
laughter
.
    
<EOS>
'
I
shall
be
glad
of
a
companion
.
'
     
<EOS>
"
When
the
paroxysm
of
laughter
was
over
,
she
fell
down
on
the
    
floor
.
<EOS>
Her
lover
would
have
raised
her
,
when
what
was
his
    
horror
to
find
that
he
held
in
his
arms
an
old
woman
,
with
    
frightfully
disfigured
features
,
and
evidently
in
the
agonies
    
of
death
.
<EOS>
She
fixed
one
look
upon
him
and
expired
.
     
<EOS>
"
Terrified
by
the
occurrence
the
guests
hurried
away
,
and
    
when
they
returned
next
day
,
they
found
Blackburn
stretched
    
on
the
floor
,
and
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
They
cast
his
body
,
together
    
with
that
of
the
wretched
Isole
,
into
the
vault
beneath
the
    
room
where
they
were
lying
,
and
then
,
taking
possession
of
    
his
treasure
,
removed
to
some
other
retreat
.
     
<EOS>
"
Thenceforth
,
Malkin
Tower
became
haunted
.
<EOS>
Though
wholly
    
deserted
,
lights
were
constantly
seen
shining
from
it
at
    
night
,
and
sounds
of
wild
revelry
,
succeeded
by
shrieks
and
    
groans
,
issued
from
it
.
<EOS>
The
figure
of
Isole
was
often
seen
to
    
come
forth
,
and
flit
across
the
wastes
in
the
direction
of
    
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
On
stormy
nights
a
huge
black
cat
,
with
    
flaming
eyes
,
was
frequently
descried
on
the
summit
of
the
    
structure
,
whence
it
obtained
its
name
of
Grimalkin
,
or
    
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
The
ill
-
omened
pile
ultimately
came
into
the
    
possession
of
the
Nutter
family
,
but
it
was
never
tenanted
,
    
until
assigned
,
as
I
have
already
mentioned
,
to
Mother
    
Demdike
.

The
chirurgeon
's
marvellous
story
was
listened
to
with
great
attention
by
his
auditors
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
were
familiar
with
different
versions
of
it
;
but
to
Master
Potts
it
was
altogether
new
,
and
he
made
rapid
notes
of
it
,
questioning
the
narrator
as
to
one
or
two
points
which
appeared
to
him
to
require
explanation
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
was
particularly
interested
in
that
part
of
the
legend
which
referred
to
Isole
de
Heton
.
<EOS>
He
now
for
the
first
time
heard
of
her
unhallowed
intercourse
with
the
freebooter
Blackburn
,
of
her
compact
on
Whalley
Nab
with
the
fiend
,
of
her
mysterious
connection
with
Malkin
Tower
,
and
of
her
being
the
ancestress
of
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
The
consideration
of
all
these
points
,
coupled
with
a
vivid
recollection
of
his
own
strange
adventure
with
the
impious
votaress
at
the
Abbey
on
the
previous
night
,
plunged
him
into
a
deep
train
of
thought
,
and
he
began
seriously
to
consider
whether
he
might
not
have
committed
some
heinous
sin
,
and
,
indeed
,
jeopardised
his
soul
's
welfare
by
dancing
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
should
share
the
same
fate
as
the
robber
Blackburn
,
"
he
ruminated
,
"
and
be
dragged
to
perdition
by
her
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
awful
reflection
.
<EOS>
But
though
my
fate
might
operate
as
a
warning
to
others
,
I
am
by
no
means
anxious
to
be
held
up
as
a
moral
scarecrow
.
<EOS>
Rather
let
me
take
warning
myself
,
amend
my
life
,
abandon
intemperance
,
which
leads
to
all
manner
of
wickedness
,
and
suffer
myself
no
more
to
be
ensnared
by
the
wiles
and
delusions
of
the
tempter
in
the
form
of
a
fair
woman
.
<EOS>
No
--
<EOS>
no
--
I
will
alter
and
amend
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
regret
,
however
,
to
say
that
these
praiseworthy
resolutions
were
but
transient
,
and
that
the
squire
,
quite
forgetting
that
the
work
of
reform
,
if
intended
to
be
really
accomplished
,
ought
to
commence
at
once
,
and
by
no
means
be
postponed
till
the
morrow
,
yielded
to
the
seductions
of
a
fresh
pottle
of
sack
,
which
was
presented
to
him
at
the
moment
by
Bess
,
and
in
taking
it
could
not
help
squeezing
the
hand
of
the
bouncing
hostess
,
and
gazing
at
her
more
tenderly
than
became
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Nicholas
--
Nicholas
--
<EOS>
the
work
of
reform
,
I
am
afraid
,
proceeds
very
slowly
and
imperfectly
with
you
.
<EOS>
Your
friend
,
Parson
.
<EOS>
Dewhurst
,
would
have
told
you
that
it
is
much
easier
to
form
good
resolutions
than
to
keep
them
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
the
squire
,
however
,
to
his
cogitations
and
his
sack
,
the
attorney
to
his
memorandum
-
book
,
in
which
he
was
still
engaged
in
writing
,
and
the
others
to
their
talk
,
we
shall
proceed
to
the
chamber
whither
the
poor
miller
had
been
led
by
Bess
.
<EOS>
When
visited
by
the
rector
,
he
had
been
apparently
soothed
by
the
worthy
man
's
consolatory
advice
,
but
when
left
alone
he
speedily
relapsed
into
his
former
dark
and
gloomy
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
notice
Bess
,
who
,
according
to
Holden
's
directions
,
placed
the
aquavitæ
bottle
before
him
,
but
,
as
long
as
she
stayed
,
remained
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
gone
he
arose
,
and
began
to
pace
the
room
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
The
window
was
open
,
and
he
could
hear
the
funeral
bell
tolling
mournfully
at
intervals
.
<EOS>
Each
recurrence
of
the
dismal
sound
added
sharpness
and
intensity
to
his
grief
.
<EOS>
His
sufferings
became
almost
intolerable
,
and
drove
him
to
the
very
verge
of
despair
and
madness
.
<EOS>
If
a
weapon
had
been
at
hand
,
he
might
have
seized
it
,
and
put
a
sudden
period
to
his
existence
.
<EOS>
His
breast
was
a
chaos
of
fierce
and
troubled
thoughts
,
in
which
one
black
and
terrible
idea
arose
and
overpowered
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
desire
of
vengeance
,
deep
and
complete
,
upon
her
whom
he
looked
upon
as
the
murderess
of
his
child
.
<EOS>
He
cared
not
how
it
were
accomplished
so
it
were
done
;
but
such
was
the
opinion
he
entertained
of
the
old
hag
's
power
,
that
he
doubted
his
ability
to
the
task
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
the
bell
tolled
on
,
the
furies
at
his
heart
lashed
and
goaded
him
on
,
and
yelled
in
his
ear
revenge
--
revenge
!
<EOS>
Now
,
indeed
,
he
was
crazed
with
grief
and
rage
;
he
tore
off
handfuls
of
hair
,
plunged
his
nails
deeply
into
his
breast
,
and
while
committing
these
and
other
wild
excesses
,
with
frantic
imprecations
he
called
down
Heaven
's
judgments
on
his
own
head
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
that
lost
and
helpless
state
when
the
enemy
of
mankind
has
power
over
man
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
opportunity
neglected
;
for
when
the
wretched
Baldwyn
,
who
,
exhausted
by
the
violence
of
his
motions
,
had
leaned
for
a
moment
against
the
wall
,
he
perceived
to
his
surprise
that
there
was
a
man
in
the
room
--
a
small
personage
attired
in
rusty
black
,
whom
he
thought
had
been
one
of
the
party
in
the
adjoining
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
expression
of
mockery
about
this
person
's
countenance
which
did
not
please
the
miller
,
and
he
asked
him
,
sternly
,
what
he
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
off
grinnin
,
mon
,
"
he
said
,
fiercely
,
"
or

<EOS>
"
No

the
man
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Eigh

cried
the
miller--"vengeance

<EOS>

the

.
 
<EOS>
"

fro

what
yo
did
just
now

"
said
the
miller
,
regarding
him
narrowly
and
distrustfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An

too

<EOS>
There

glimmer
abowt

"
 
<EOS>
The
man
laughed
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
off
grinnin
'
or
begone
,
"
cried
Baldwyn
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
And
he
raised
his
hand
to
strike
the
man
,
but
he
instantly
dropped
it
,
appalled
by
a
look
which
the
other
threw
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
the
dule
are
yo
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
dule
must
answer
you
,
since
you
appeal
to
him
,
"
replied
the
other
,
with
the
same
mocking
smile
;
"
but
you
are
mistaken
in
supposing
that
you
have
spoken
to
me
before
.
<EOS>
He
with
whom
you
conversed
in
the
other
room
,
resembles
me
in
more
respects
than
one
,
but
he
does
not
possess
power
equal
to
mine
.
<EOS>
The
law
will
not
aid
you
against
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
She
will
escape
all
the
snares
laid
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
will
not
escape
_
me
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
ye
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
miller
,
his
hair
erecting
on
his
head
,
and
cold
damps
breaking
out
upon
his
brow
.
"
<EOS>
Yo

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
not
who
and
what
I
am
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
I
am
known
here
as
a
reeve
of
the
forest
--
that
is
enough
.
<EOS>
Would
you
have
vengeance
on
the
murtheress
of
your
child
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
,
"
rejoined
Baldwyn
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
willing
to
pay
for
it
at
the
price
of
your
soul
?
"
demanded
the
other
,
advancing
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
Baldwyn
reeled
.
<EOS>
He
saw
at
once
the
fearful
peril
in
which
he
was
placed
,
and
averted
his
gaze
from
the
scorching
glance
of
the
reeve
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
door
was
tried
without
,
and
the
voice
of
Bess
was
heard
,
saying
,
"
Who
ha
'
yo

and

<EOS>
"
Your

"
demanded
the
reeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

replied
the

.
<EOS>
"

said

"

said
the

.
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed

replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I

"
 
<EOS>
And
he
sprang
through
the
window
,
and
disappeared
before
Baldwyn
could
open

CHAPTER
VII.--THE
PERAMBULATION
OF
THE
BOUNDARIES
.
  
<EOS>
The
lane
along
which
Richard
Assheton
galloped
in
pursuit
of
Mother
Chattox
,
made
so
many
turns
,
and
was
,
moreover
,
so
completely
hemmed
in
by
high
banks
and
hedges
,
that
he
could
sec
nothing
on
either
side
of
him
,
and
very
little
in
advance
;
but
,
guided
by
the
clatter
of
hoofs
,
he
urged
Merlin
to
his
utmost
speed
,
fancying
he
should
soon
come
up
with
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
In
this
,
however
,
he
was
deceived
.
<EOS>
The
sound
that
had
led
him
on
became
fainter
and
fainter
,
till
at
last
it
died
away
altogether
;
and
on
quitting
the
lane
and
gaining
the
moor
,
where
the
view
was
wholly
uninterrupted
,
no
traces
either
of
witch
or
reeve
could
be
discerned
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
feeling
of
angry
disappointment
,
Richard
was
about
to
turn
back
,
when
a
large
black
greyhound
came
from
out
an
adjoining
clough
,
and
made
towards
him
.
<EOS>
The
singularity
of
the
circumstance
induced
him
to
halt
and
regard
the
dog
with
attention
.
<EOS>
On
nearing
him
,
the
animal
looked
wistfully
in
his
face
,
and
seemed
to
invite
him
to
follow
;
and
the
young
man
was
so
struck
by
the
dog
's
manner
,
that
he
complied
,
and
had
not
gone
far
when
a
hare
of
unusual
size
and
grey
with
age
bounded
from
beneath
a
gorse
-
bush
and
speeded
away
,
the
greyhound
starting
in
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
Aware
of
the
prevailing
notion
,
that
a
witch
most
commonly
assumed
such
a
form
when
desirous
of
escaping
,
or
performing
some
act
of
mischief
,
such
as
drying
the
milk
of
kine
,
<EOS>
Richard
at
once
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
hare
could
be
no
other
than
Mother
Chattox
;
and
without
pausing
to
inquire
what
the
hound
could
be
,
or
why
it
should
appear
at
such
a
singular
and
apparently
fortunate
juncture
,
he
at
once
joined
the
run
,
and
cheered
on
the
dog
with
whoop
and
holloa
.
 
<EOS>
Old
as
it
was
,
apparently
,
the
hare
ran
with
extraordinary
swiftness
,
clearing
every
stone
wall
and
other
impediment
in
the
way
,
and
more
than
once
cunningly
doubling
upon
its
pursuers
.
<EOS>
But
every
feint
and
stratagem
were
defeated
by
the
fleet
and
sagacious
hound
,
and
the
hunted
animal
at
length
took
to
the
open
waste
,
where
the
run
became
so
rapid
,
that
Richard
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
up
with
it
,
though
Merlin
,
almost
as
furiously
excited
as
his
master
,
strained
every
sinew
to
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
the
chasers
and
the
chased
scoured
the
dark
and
heathy
plain
,
skirting
moss
-
pool
and
clearing
dyke
,
till
they
almost
reached
the
but
-
end
of
Pendle
Hill
,
which
rose
like
an
impassable
barrier
before
them
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
chances
had
seemed
in
favour
of
the
hare
;
but
they
now
began
to
turn
,
and
as
it
seemed
certain
she
must
fall
into
the
hound
's
jaws
,
Richard
expected
every
moment
to
find
her
resume
her
natural
form
.
<EOS>
The
run
having
brought
him
within
,
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
Barley
,
the
rude
hovels
composing
which
little
booth
were
clearly
discernible
,
the
young
man
began
to
think
the
hag
's
dwelling
must
he
among
them
,
and
that
she
was
hurrying
thither
as
to
a
place
of
refuge
.
<EOS>
But
before
this
could
be
accomplished
,
he
hoped
to
effect
her
capture
,
and
once
more
cheered
on
the
hound
,
and
plunged
his
spurs
into
Merlin
's
sides
.
<EOS>
An
obstacle
,
however
,
occurred
which
he
had
not
counted
on
.
<EOS>
Directly
in
the
course
taken
by
the
hare
lay
a
deep
,
disused
limestone
quarry
,
completely
screened
from
view
by
a
fringe
of
brushwood
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
few
yards
of
this
pit
,
the
hound
made
a
dash
at
the
flying
hare
,
but
eluding
him
,
the
latter
sprang
forward
,
and
both
went
over
the
edge
of
the
quarry
together
.
<EOS>
Richard
had
wellnigh
followed
,
and
in
that
case
would
have
been
inevitably
dashed
in
pieces
;
but
,
discovering
the
danger
ere
it
was
too
late
,
by
a
powerful
effort
,
which
threw
Merlin
upon
his
haunches
,
he
pulled
him
back
on
the
very
brink
of
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
shuddered
as
he
gazed
into
the
depths
of
the
quarry
,
and
saw
the
jagged
points
and
heaps
of
broken
stone
that
would
have
received
him
;
but
he
looked
in
vain
for
the
old
witch
,
whose
mangled
body
,
together
with
that
of
the
hound
,
he
expected
to
behold
;
and
he
then
asked
himself
whether
the
chase
might
not
have
been
a
snare
set
for
him
by
the
hag
and
her
familiar
,
with
the
intent
of
luring
him
to
destruction
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
he
had
been
providentially
preserved
.
 
<EOS>
Quitting
the
pit
,
his
first
idea
was
to
proceed
to
Barley
,
which
was
now
only
a
few
hundred
yards
off
,
to
make
inquiries
respecting
Mother
Chattox
,
and
ascertain
whether
she
really
dwelt
there
;
but
,
on
further
consideration
,
he
judged
it
best
to
return
without
further
delay
to
Goldshaw
,
lest
his
friends
,
ignorant
as
to
what
had
befallen
him
,
might
become
alarmed
on
his
account
;
but
he
resolved
,
as
soon
as
he
had
disposed
of
the
business
in
hand
,
to
prosecute
his
search
after
the
hag
.
<EOS>
Riding
rapidly
,
he
soon
cleared
the
ground
between
the
quarry
and
Goldshaw
Lane
,
and
was
about
to
enter
the
latter
,
when
the
sound
of
voices
singing
a
funeral
hymn
caught
his
ear
,
and
,
pausing
to
listen
to
it
,
he
beheld
a
little
procession
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
readily
comprehended
,
wending
its
slow
and
melancholy
way
in
the
same
direction
as
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
headed
by
four
men
in
deep
mourning
,
bearing
upon
their
shoulders
a
small
coffin
,
covered
with
a
pall
,
and
having
a
garland
of
white
flowers
in
front
of
it
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
followed
about
a
dozen
young
men
and
maidens
,
likewise
in
mourning
,
walking
two
and
two
,
with
gait
and
aspect
of
unfeigned
affliction
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
women
,
though
merely
rustics
,
seemed
to
possess
considerable
personal
attraction
;
but
their
features
were
in
a
great
measure
concealed
by
their
large
white
kerchiefs
,
disposed
in
the
form
of
hoods
.
<EOS>
All
carried
sprigs
of
rosemary
and
bunches
of
flowers
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Plaintive
was
the
hymn
they
sang
,
and
their
voices
,
though
untaught
,
were
sweet
and
touching
,
and
went
to
the
heart
of
the
listener
.
 
<EOS>
Much
moved
,
Richard
suffered
the
funeral
procession
to
precede
him
along
the
deep
and
devious
lane
,
and
as
it
winded
beneath
the
hedges
,
the
sight
was
inexpressibly
affecting
.
<EOS>
Fastening
his
horse
to
a
tree
at
the
end
of
the
lane
,
Richard
followed
on
foot
.
<EOS>
Notice
of
the
approach
of
the
train
having
been
given
in
the
village
,
all
the
inhabitants
flocked
forth
to
meet
it
,
and
there
was
scarcely
a
dry
eye
among
them
.
<EOS>
Arrived
within
a
short
distance
of
the
church
,
the
coffin
was
met
by
the
minister
,
attended
by
the
clerk
,
behind
whom
came
Roger
Nowell
,
Nicholas
,
and
the
rest
of
the
company
from
the
hostel
.
<EOS>
With
great
difficulty
poor
Baldwyn
could
be
brought
to
take
his
place
as
chief
mourner
.
<EOS>
These
arrangements
completed
,
the
body
of
the
ill
-
fated
girl
was
borne
into
the
churchyard
,
the
minister
reading
the
solemn
texts
appointed
for
the
occasion
,
and
leading
the
way
to
the
grave
,
beside
which
stood
the
sexton
,
together
with
the
beadle
of
Goldshaw
and
Sparshot
.
<EOS>
The
coffin
was
then
laid
on
trestles
,
and
amidst
profound
silence
,
broken
only
by
the
sobs
of
the
mourners
,
the
service
was
read
,
and
preparations
made
for
lowering
the
body
into
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
poor
Baldwyn
,
with
a
wild
,
heart
-
piercing
cry
,
flung
himself
upon
the
shell
containing
all
that
remained
of
his
lost
treasure
,
and
could
with
difficulty
be
removed
from
it
by
Bess
and
Sudall
,
both
of
whom
were
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
The
bunches
of
flowers
and
sprigs
of
rosemary
having
been
laid
upon
the
coffin
by
the
maidens
,
amidst
loud
sobbing
and
audibly
expressed
lamentations
from
the
bystanders
,
it
was
let
down
into
the
grave
,
and
earth
thrown
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
Earth
to
earth
;
ashes
to
ashes
;
dust
to
dust
.
 
<EOS>
The
ceremony
was
over
,
the
mourners
betook
themselves
to
the
little
hostel
,
and
the
spectators
slowly
dispersed
;
but
the
bereaved
father
still
lingered
,
unable
to
tear
himself
away
.
<EOS>
Leaning
for
support
against
the
yew
-
tree
,
he
fiercely
bade
Bess
,
who
would
have
led
him
home
with
her
,
begone
.
<EOS>
The
kind
-
hearted
hostess
complied
in
appearance
,
but
remained
nigh
at
hand
though
concealed
from
view
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
the
dark
cloud
overshadowed
the
spirit
of
the
wretched
man
<EOS>
--
once
more
the
same
infernal
desire
of
vengeance
possessed
him
--
once
more
he
subjected
himself
to
temptation
.
<EOS>
Striding
to
the
foot
of
the
grave
he
raised
his
hand
,
and
with
terrible
imprecations
vowed
to
lay
the
murtheress
of
his
child
as
low
as
she
herself
was
now
laid
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
he
felt
an
eye
like
a
burning
-
glass
fixed
upon
him
,
and
,
looking
up
,
beheld
the
reeve
of
the
forest
standing
on
the
further
side
of
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
Kneel
down
,
and
swear
to
be
mine
,
and
your
wish
shall
be
gratified
,
"
said
the
reeve
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
himself
with
grief
and
rage
,
Baldwyn
would
have
complied
,
but
he
was
arrested
by
a
powerful
grasp
.
<EOS>
Fearing
he
was
about
to
commit
some
rash
act
,
Bess
rushed
forward
and
caught
hold
of
his
doublet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bethink

the

,
striking
his
breast
.

"

<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
reeve
had
sprung
across
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
answer

once
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
grasping
the
miller
's
arm
,
and
breathing
the
words
in
his
ears
.
<EOS>
"
Vengeance

<EOS>
A
word

and

"
 
<EOS>
The
miller
groaned
bitterly
.
<EOS>
He
was
sorely
tempted
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
that

<EOS>
inquired
Bess

<EOS>
"

sturdily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave

whispered
the

.
 
<EOS>
"

;

<EOS>
"
Fool

"
cried
the
reeve
,
in
the
same
low
tone
as
before
;
"
you
will
lose
your
revenge
,
but
you
will
not
escape
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
turned
away
,
while
Bess
almost
carried
the
trembling
and
enfeebled
miller
towards
the
hostel
.
 
<EOS>
Roger
Nowell
and
his
friends
had
only
waited
the
conclusion
of
the
funeral
to
set
forth
,
and
their
horses
being
in
readiness
,
they
mounted
them
on
leaving
the
churchyard
,
and
rode
slowly
along
the
lane
leading
towards
Rough
Lee
.
<EOS>
The
melancholy
scene
they
had
witnessed
,
and
the
afflicting
circumstances
connected
with
it
,
had
painfully
affected
the
party
,
and
little
conversation
occurred
until
they
were
overtaken
by
Parson
Holden
,
who
,
having
been
made
acquainted
with
their
errand
by
Nicholas
,
was
desirous
of
accompanying
them
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
also
,
the
reeve
of
the
forest
joined
them
,
and
on
seeing
him
,
Richard
sternly
demanded
why
he
had
aided
Mother
Chattox
in
her
night
from
the
churchyard
,
and
what
had
become
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
entirely
mistaken
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
reeve
,
with
affected
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
nothing
whatever
of
the
old
hag
,
and
would
rather
lend
a
hand
to
her
capture
than
abet
her
flight
.
<EOS>
I
hold
all
witches
in
abhorrence
,
and
Mother
Chattox
especially
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
horse
looks
fresh
enough
,
certainly
,
"
said
Richard
,
somewhat
shaken
in
his
suspicions
.
<EOS>
"
Where
have
you
been
during
our
stay
at
Goldshaw
?
<EOS>
You
did
not
put
up
at
the
hostel
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
went
to
Farmer
Johnson
's
,
"
replied
the
reeve
,
"
and
you
will
find
upon
inquiry
that
my
horse
has
not
been
out
of
his
stables
for
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
I
myself
have
been
loitering
about
Bess
's
grange
and
farmyard
,
as
your
grooms
will
testify
,
for
they
have
seen
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Richard
,
"
I
suppose
I
must
credit
assertions
made
with
such
confidence
,
but
I
could
have
sworn
I
saw
you
ride
off
with
the
hag
behind
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
never
be
caught
in
such
bad
company
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
reeve
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
ride
off
with
any
one
,
it
shall
not
be
with
an
old
witch
,
depend
upon
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Though
by
no
means
satisfied
with
the
explanation
,
Richard
was
forced
to
be
content
with
it
;
but
he
thought
he
would
address
a
few
more
questions
to
the
reeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
knowledge
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
the
boundaries
of
Pendle
Forest
were
first
settled
and
appointed
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
first
perambulation
was
made
by
Henry
de
Lacy
,
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
,
"
replied
the
reeve
.
"
<EOS>
Pendle
Forest
,
you
may
be
aware
,
sir
,
is
one
of
the
four
divisions
of
the
great
forest
of
Blackburnshire
,
of
which
the
Lacys
were
lords
,
the
three
other
divisions
being
Accrington
,
Trawden
,
and
Rossendale
,
and
it
comprehends
an
extent
of
about
twenty
-
five
miles
,
part
of
which
you
have
traversed
to

day
.
<EOS>
At
a
later
period
,
namely
in
1311
,
after
the
death
of
another
Henry
de
Lacy
,
Earl
of
Lincoln
,
the
last
of
his
line
,
and
one
of
the
bravest
of
Edward
the
First
's
barons
,
an
inquisition
was
held
in
the
forest
,
and
it
was
subdivided
into
eleven
vaccaries
,
one
of
which
is
the
place
to
which
you
are
bound
,
Rough
Lee
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
learned
Sir
Edward
Coke
defines
a
vaccary
to
signify
a
dairy
,
"
observed
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
it
means
the
farm
and
land
as
well
,
"
replied
the
reeve
;
"
and
the
word
'
booth
,
'
which
is
in
general
use
in
this
district
,
signifies
the
mansion
erected
upon
such
vaccary
:
Mistress
Nutter
's
residence
,
for
instance
,
being
nothing
more
than
the
booth
of
Rough
Lee
:
while
a
'
lawnd
,
'
another
local
term
,
is
a
park
inclosed
within
the
forest
for
the
preservation
of
the
deer
,
and
the
convenience
of
the
chase
,
and
of
such
inclosures
we
have
two
,

the
Old

New
Lawnd

<EOS>
By
a
commission
in
the
reign
of
Henry
VII
.
,
these
vaccaries
,
originally
granted
only
to
tenants
at
will
,
were
converted
into
copyholds
of
inheritance
,
but
--
and
here
is
a
legal
point
for
your
consideration
,
Master
Potts
--
as
it
seems
very
questionable
whether
titles
obtained
under
letters
-
patent
are
secure
,
not
unreasonable
fears
are
entertained
by
the
holders
of
the
lands
lest
they
should
be
seized
,
and
appropriated
by
the
crown
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
ah
!
<EOS>
an
excellent
idea
,
Master
Reeve
,
"
exclaimed
Potts
,
his
little
eyes
twinkling
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
Our
gracious
and
sagacious
monarch
would
grasp
at
the
suggestion
,
ay
,
and
grasp
at
the
lands
too
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Many
thanks
for
the
hint
,
<EOS>
good
reeve
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
fail
to
profit
by
it
.
<EOS>
If
their
titles
are
uncertain
,
the
landholders
would
be
glad
to
compromise
the
matter
with
the
crown
,
even
to
the
value
of
half
their
estates
rather
than
lose
the
whole
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
assuredly
they
would
,
"
replied
the
reeve
;
"
and
furthermore
,
they
would
pay
the
lawyer
well
<EOS>
who
could
manage
the
matter
adroitly
for
them
.
<EOS>
This
would
answer
your
purpose
better
than
hunting
up
witches
,
Master
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
pursuit
does
not
interfere
with
the
other
in
the
slightest
degree
,
worthy
reeve
,
"
observed
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
consent
to
give
up
my
quest
of
the
witches
.
<EOS>
My
honour
is
concerned
in
their
extermination
.
<EOS>
But
to
turn
to
Pendle
Forest
--
the
greater
part
of
it
has
been
disafforested
,
I
presume
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
,
"
replied
the
other--"and
we
are
now
in
one
of
the
purlieus
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pourallee
is
the
better
word
,
most
excellent
reeve
,
"
said
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
thus
much
,
because
you
appear
to
be
a
man
of
learning
.
<EOS>
Manwood
,
our
great
authority
in
such
matters
,
declares
a
pourallee
to
be
'
a
certain
territory
of
ground
adjoining
unto
the
forest
,
mered
and
bounded
with
immovable
marks
,
meres
,
and
boundaries
,
known
by
matter
of
record
only
.
'
<EOS>
And
as
it
applies
to
the
perambulation
we
are
about
to
make
,
I
may
as
well
repeat
what
the
same
learned
writer
further
saith
touching
marks
,
meres
,
and
boundaries
,
and
how
they
may
be
known
.
'
<EOS>
For
although
,
'
he
saith
,
'
a
forest
doth
lie
open
,
and
not
inclosed
with
hedge
,
ditch
,
pale
,
or
stone
-
wall
,
which
some
other
inclosures
have
;
yet
in
the
eye
and
consideration
of
the
law
,
the
same
hath
as
strong
an
inclosure
by
those
marks
,
meres
,
and
boundaries
,
as
if
there
were
a
brick
wall
to
encircle
the
same
.
'
<EOS>
Marks
,
learned
reeve
,
are
deemed
unremovable--
<EOS>
_
primo
,
quia
omnes
metæ
forestæ
sunt
integræ
domino
regi_--and
those
who
take
them
away
are
punishable
for
the
trespass
at
the
assizes
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
_
Secundo
_
,
because
the
marks
are
things
that
can
not
be
stirred
,
as
rivers
,
highways
,
hills
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
Now
,
such
unremoveable
marks
,
meres
,
and
boundaries
we
have
between
the
estate
of
my
excellent
client
,
Master
Roger
Nowell
,
and
that
of
Mistress
Nutter
,
so
that
the
matter
at
issue
will
be
easily
decided
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
singular
smile
crossed
the
reeve
's
countenance
,
but
he
made
no
observation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Unless
the
lady
can
turn
aside
streams
,
remove
hills
,
and
pluck
up
huge
trees
,
we
shall
win
,
"
pursued
Potts
,
with
a
chuckle
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
reeve
smiled
,
but
he
forebore
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
talk
of
marks
,
meres
,
and
boundaries
,
Master
Potts
,
"
remarked
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Are
not
the
words
synonymous
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
precisely
so
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
"
there
is
a
slight
difference
in
their
signification
,
which
I
will
explain
to
you
.
<EOS>
The
words
of
the
statute
are
'
_
metas
,
meras
,
et
<EOS>
bundas_,'--now
_
meta
_
,
or
mark
,
is
an
object
rising
from
the
ground
,
as
a
church
,
a
wall
,
or
a
tree
;
_
mera
_
,
or
mere
,
is
the
space
or
interval
between
the
forest
and
the
land
adjoining
,
whereupon
the
mark
may
chance
to
stand
;
and
_
bunda
_
is
the
boundary
,
lying
on
a
level
with
the
forest
,
as
a
river
,
a
highway
,
a
pool
,
or
a
bog
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
comprehend
the
distinction
,
"
replied
Richard
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
we
are
on
this
subject
,
"
he
added
to
the
reeve
,
"
I
would
gladly
know
the
precise
nature
of
your
office
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
duty
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
is
to
range
daily
throughout
all
the
purlieus
,
or
pourallees
,
as
Master
Potts
more
properly
terms
them
,
and
disafforested
lands
,
and
inquire
into
all
trespasses
and
offences
against
vert
or
venison
,
and
present
them
at
the
king
's
next
court
of
attachment
or
swainmote
.
<EOS>
It
is
also
my
business
to
drive
into
the
forest
such
wild
beasts
as
have
strayed
from
it
;
to
attend
to
the
lawing
and
expeditation
of
mastiffs
;
and
to
raise
hue
and
cry
against
any
malefactors
or
trespassers
within
the
forest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
the
exact
words
of
the
statute
,
"
said
Potts--'_Si
quis
viderit
malefactores
infra
metas
forestæ
,
debet
illos
capere
secundum
posse
suum
,
et
si
non
possit
;
debet
levare
hutesium
et
clamorem
_
.
'
<EOS>
And
the
penalty
for
refusing
to
follow
hue
and
cry
is
heavy
fine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
that
that
part
of
your
duty
relating
to
the
hock
-
sinewing
,
and
lawing
of
mastiffs
,
could
be
discontinued
,
"
said
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
I
grieve
to
see
a
noble
animal
so
mutilated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
Bowland
Forest
,
as
you
are
probably
aware
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
reeve
,
"
only
the
larger
mastiffs
are
lamed
,
a
small
stirrup
or
gauge
being
kept
by
the
master
forester
,
Squire
Robert
Parker
of
Browsholme
,
and
the
dog
whose
foot
will
pass
through
it
escapes
mutilation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
practice
is
a
cruel
one
,
and
I
would
it
were
abolished
with
some
of
our
other
barbarous
forest
laws
,
"
observed
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
conversation
had
been
going
on
,
the
party
had
proceeded
well
on
their
way
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
the
road
,
which
consisted
of
little
more
than
tracts
of
wheels
along
the
turf
,
led
along
a
plain
,
thrown
up
into
heathy
hillocks
,
and
then
passing
through
a
thicket
,
evidently
part
of
the
old
forest
,
it
brought
them
to
the
foot
of
a
hill
,
which
they
mounted
,
and
descended
into
another
valley
.
<EOS>
Here
they
came
upon
Pendle
Water
,
and
while
skirting
its
banks
,
could
see
at
a
great
depth
below
,
the
river
rushing
over
its
rocky
bed
like
an
Alpine
torrent
.
<EOS>
The
scenery
had
now
begun
to
assume
a
savage
and
sombre
character
.
<EOS>
The
deep
rift
through
which
the
river
ran
was
evidently
the
result
of
some
terrible
convulsion
of
the
earth
,
and
the
rocky
strata
were
strangely
and
fantastically
displayed
.
<EOS>
On
the
further
side
the
banks
rose
up
precipitously
,
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
bare
cliffs
,
though
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
tree
would
root
itself
in
some
crevice
.
<EOS>
Below
this
the
stream
sank
over
a
wide
shelf
of
rock
,
in
a
broad
full
cascade
,
and
boiled
and
foamed
in
the
stony
basin
that
received
it
,
after
which
,
grown
less
impetuous
,
it
ran
tranquilly
on
for
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
,
and
was
then
artificially
restrained
by
a
dam
,
which
,
diverting
it
in
part
from
its
course
,
caused
it
to
turn
the
wheels
of
a
mill
.
<EOS>
Here
was
the
abode
of
the
unfortunate
Richard
Baldwyn
,
and
here
had
blossomed
forth
the
fair
flower
so
untimely
gathered
.
<EOS>
An
air
of
gloom
hung
over
this
once
cheerful
spot
:
its
very
beauty
contributing
to
this
saddening
effect
.
<EOS>
The
mill
-
race
flowed
swiftly
and
brightly
on
;
but
the
wheel
was
stopped
,
windows
and
doors
were
closed
,
and
death
kept
his
grim
holiday
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
to
be
seen
about
the
premises
,
nor
was
any
sound
heard
except
the
bark
of
the
lonely
watch
-
dog
.
<EOS>
Many
a
sorrowing
glance
was
cast
at
this
forlorn
habitation
as
the
party
rode
past
it
,
and
many
a
sigh
was
heaved
for
the
poor
girl
who
had
so
lately
been
its
pride
and
ornament
;
but
if
any
one
had
noticed
the
bitter
sneer
curling
the
reeve
's
lip
,
or
caught
the
malignant
fire
gleaming
in
his
eye
,
it
would
scarcely
have
been
thought
that
he
shared
in
the
general
regret
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
cavalcade
had
passed
the
mill
,
one
or
two
other
cottages
appeared
on
the
near
side
of
the
river
,
while
the
opposite
banks
began
to
be
clothed
with
timber
.
<EOS>
The
glen
became
more
and
more
contracted
,
and
a
stone
bridge
crossed
the
stream
,
near
which
,
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
as
the
party
,
stood
a
cluster
of
cottages
constituting
the
little
village
of
Rough
Lee
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
bridge
,
Mistress
Nutter
's
habitation
came
in
view
,
and
it
was
pointed
out
by
Nicholas
to
Potts
,
who
contemplated
it
with
much
curiosity
.
<EOS>
In
his
eyes
it
seemed
exactly
adapted
to
its
owner
,
and
formed
to
hide
dark
and
guilty
deeds
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
stern
,
sombre
-
looking
mansion
,
built
of
a
dark
grey
stone
,
with
tall
square
chimneys
,
and
windows
with
heavy
mullions
.
<EOS>
High
stone
walls
,
hoary
and
moss
-
grown
,
ran
round
the
gardens
and
courts
,
except
on
the
side
of
the
river
,
where
there
was
a
terrace
overlooking
the
stream
,
and
forming
a
pleasant
summer
's
walk
.
<EOS>
At
the
back
of
the
house
were
a
few
ancient
oaks
and
sycamores
,
and
in
the
gardens
were
some
old
clipped
yews
.
 
<EOS>
Part
of
this
ancient
mansion
is
still
standing
,
and
retains
much
of
its
original
character
,
though
subdivided
and
tenanted
by
several
humble
families
.
<EOS>
The
garden
is
cut
up
into
paddocks
,
and
the
approach
environed
by
a
labyrinth
of
low
stone
walls
,
while
miserable
sheds
and
other
buildings
are
appended
to
it
;
the
terrace
is
wholly
obliterated
;
and
the
grange
and
offices
are
pulled
down
,
but
sufficient
is
still
left
of
the
place
to
give
an
idea
of
its
pristine
appearance
and
character
.
<EOS>
Its
situation
is
striking
and
peculiar
.
<EOS>
In
front
rises
a
high
hill
,
forming
the
last
link
of
the
chain
of
Pendle
,
and
looking
upon
Barrowford
and
Colne
,
on
the
further
side
of
which
,
and
therefore
not
discernible
from
the
mansion
,
stood
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
At
the
period
in
question
the
lower
part
of
this
hill
was
well
wooded
,
and
washed
by
the
Pendle
Water
,
which
swept
past
it
through
banks
picturesque
and
beautiful
,
though
not
so
bold
and
rocky
as
those
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mill
.
<EOS>
In
the
rear
of
the
house
the
ground
gradually
rose
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
when
it
obtained
a
considerable
elevation
,
following
the
course
of
the
stream
,
and
looking
down
the
gorge
,
another
hill
appeared
,
so
that
the
house
was
completely
shut
in
by
mountainous
acclivities
.
<EOS>
In
winter
,
when
the
snow
lay
on
the
heights
,
or
when
the
mists
hung
upon
them
for
weeks
together
,
or
descended
in
continuous
rain
,
Rough
Lee
was
sufficiently
desolate
,
and
seemed
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
the
outer
world
;
but
at
the
season
when
the
party
beheld
it
,
though
the
approaches
were
rugged
and
difficult
,
and
almost
inaccessible
except
to
the
horseman
or
pedestrian
,
bidding
defiance
to
any
vehicle
except
of
the
strongest
construction
,
still
the
place
was
not
without
a
certain
charm
,
mainly
,
however
,
derived
from
its
seclusion
.
<EOS>
The
scenery
was
stern
and
sombre
,
the
hills
were
dark
and
dreary
;
but
the
very
wildness
of
the
place
was
attractive
,
and
the
old
house
,
with
its
grey
walls
,
<EOS>
its
lofty
chimneys
,
its
gardens
with
their
clipped
yews
,
and
its
rook
-
haunted
trees
,
harmonised
well
with
all
around
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
party
drew
near
the
house
,
the
gates
were
thrown
open
by
an
old
porter
with
two
other
servants
,
who
besought
them
to
stay
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
;
but
Roger
Nowell
haughtily
and
peremptorily
declined
the
invitation
,
and
rode
on
,
and
the
others
,
though
some
of
them
would
fain
have
complied
,
followed
him
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
they
gone
,
than
James
Device
,
who
had
been
in
the
garden
,
issued
from
the
gate
and
speeded
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
through
a
close
at
the
back
of
the
mansion
,
and
tracking
a
short
narrow
lane
,
edged
by
stone
walls
,
the
party
,
which
had
received
some
accessions
from
the
cottages
of
Rough
Lee
,
as
well
as
from
the
huts
on
the
hill
-
side
,
again
approached
the
river
,
and
proceeded
along
its
banks
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
-
comers
,
being
all
of
them
tenants
of
Mrs.
Nutter
,
and
acting
apparently
under
the
directions
of
James
Device
,
who
had
now
joined
the
troop
,
stoutly
and
loudly
maintained
that
the
lady
would
be
found
right
in
the
inquiry
,
with
the
exception
of
one
old
man
named
Henry
Mitton
;
and
he
shook
his
head
gravely
when
appealed
to
by
Jem
,
and
could
by
no
efforts
be
induced
to
join
him
in
the
clamour
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
demonstration
,
Roger
Nowell
and
his
legal
adviser
were
both
very
sanguine
as
to
the
result
of
the
survey
being
in
their
favour
,
and
Master
Potts
turned
to
ascertain
from
Sparshot
that
the
two
plans
,
which
had
been
rolled
up
and
consigned
to
his
custody
,
were
quite
safe
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
party
having
followed
the
course
of
Pendle
Water
through
the
glen
for
about
half
a
mile
,
during
which
they
kept
close
to
the
brawling
current
,
entered
a
little
thicket
,
and
then
striking
off
on
the
left
,
passed
over
the
foot
of
a
hill
,
and
came
to
the
edge
of
a
wide
moor
,
where
a
halt
was
called
by
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
now
announced
that
they
were
on
the
confines
of
the
disputed
property
,
preparations
were
immediately
made
for
the
survey
;
the
plans
were
taken
out
of
a
quiver
,
in
which
they
had
been
carefully
deposited
by
Sparshot
,
and
handed
to
Potts
,
who
,
giving
one
to
Roger
Nowell
and
the
other
to
Nicholas
,
and
opening
his
memorandum
-
book
,
declared
that
all
was
ready
,
and
the
two
leaders
rode
slowly
forward
,
while
the
rest
of
the
troop
followed
,
their
curiosity
being
stimulated
to
the
highest
pitch
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
Roger
Nowell
again
stopped
,
and
pointed
to
a
woody
brake
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
now
come
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
a
wood
forming
part
of
my
property
,
and
which
from
an
eruption
,
caused
by
a
spring
,
that
took
place
in
it
many
years
ago
,
is
called
Burst
Clough
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
sir
--
exactly
,
"
cried
Potts
;
"
Burst
Clough
--
I
have
it
here
--
landmarks
,
five
grey
stones
,
lying
apart
at
a
distance
of
one
hundred
yards
or
thereabouts
,
and
giving
you
,
sir
,
twenty
acres
of
moor
land
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
,
Master
Nicholas
?
<EOS>
The
marks
are
such
as
I
have
described
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
squire
;
"
with
this
slight
difference
in
the
allotment
of
the
land
--
namely
,
that
Mistress
Nutter
claims
the
twenty
acres
,
while
she
assigns
you
only
ten
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ten
devils
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Roger
Nowell
,
furiously
.
"
<EOS>
Twenty
acres
are
mine
,
and
I
will
have
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
proof
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
The
first
of
the
grey
stones
is
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
second
on
the
left
,
in
that
hollow
,
"
said
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
Come
on
,
my
masters
,
come
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
come
on
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
;
"
this
perambulation
will
be
rare
sport
.
<EOS>
Who
wins
,
for
a
piece
of
gold
,
cousin
Richard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
will
place
no
wager
on
the
event
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
as
you
please
,
"
cried
the
squire
;
"
but
I
would
lay
five
to
one
that
Mistress
Nutter
beats
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
whole
troop
having
set
forward
,
they
soon
arrived
at
the
second
stone
.
<EOS>
Grey
and
moss
-
grown
,
it
was
deeply
imbedded
in
the
soil
,
and
to
all
appearance
had
rested
undisturbed
for
many
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
measure
from
the
clough
,
I
presume
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
remarked
Potts
to
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
replied
the
magistrate
;
"
but
how
is
this?--This
stone
seems
to
me
much
nearer
<EOS>
the
clough
than
it
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
,
so
it
dun
,
mester
,
"
observed
old
Mitton
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
appear
to
have
been
disturbed
,
at
all
events
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
dismounting
and
examining
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
seem
not
,
"
said
Nowell--"and
<EOS>
yet
it
certainly
is
not
in
its
old
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
are
mistaen
,
mester
,
"
observed
Jem
Device
;
"
<EOS>
ey
knoa
th
'
lond
weel
,
an
this
stoan
has
stood
where
it
does
fo

last
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
Ha'n't
it
,
neeburs
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
--
yeigh
,
"
responded
several
voices
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
let
us
go
on
to
the
next
stone
,
"
said
Potts
,
looking
rather
blank
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
went
forward
,
the
hinds
exchanging
significant
looks
,
and
Roger
Nowell
and
Nicholas
carefully
examining
their
respective
maps
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
landmarks
exactly
tally
with
my
plan
,
"
said
the
squire
,
as
they
arrived
at
the
third
stone
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
not
with
mine
,
"
said
Nowell
;
"
this
stone
ought
to
be
two
hundred
yards
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
Some
trickery
has
been
practised
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
exclaimed
the
squire
;
"
these
ponderous
masses
could
never
have
been
moved
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
are
several
persons
here
who
know
every
inch
of
the
ground
,
and
will
give
you
their
unbiassed
testimony
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
my
men
?
<EOS>
Are
these
the
old
boundary
stones
?
"
 
<EOS>
All
answered
in
the
affirmative
except
old
Mitton
,
who
still
raised
a
dissenting
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
th
'
owd
boundary
marks
,
sure
enough
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
boh
they
are
neaw
<EOS>
i
'
their
owd
places
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
clear
that
the
twenty
acres
belong
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
"
and
that
you
must
content
yourself
with
ten
,
Master
Nowell
.
<EOS>
Make
an
entry
to
that
effect
,
Master
Potts
,
unless
you
will
have
the
ground
measured
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
is
needless
,
"
replied
the
magistrate
,
sharply
;
"
let
us
go
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
During
this
survey
,
some
of
the
features
of
the
country
appeared
changed
to
the
rustics
,
but
how
or
in
what
way
they
could
not
precisely
tell
,
and
they
were
easily
induced
by
James
Device
to
give
their
testimony
in
Mistress
Nutter
's
favour
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
rivulet
was
now
reached
,
and
another
halt
being
called
upon
its
sedgy
banks
,
the
plans
were
again
consulted
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
we
here
,
Master
Potts
--
marks
or
boundaries
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Richard
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Both
,
"
replied
Potts
,
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
This
rivulet
,
which
I
take
to
be
Moss
Brook
,
is
a
boundary
,
and
that
sheepfold
and
the
two
posts
standing
in
a
line
with
it
are
marks
.
<EOS>
But
hold
!
<EOS>
how
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
regarding
the
plan
in
dismay
;
"
the
five
acres
of
waste
land
should
be
on
the
left
of
the
brook
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
doubtless
suit
Master
Nowell
better
if
it
were
so
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
"
<EOS>
but
as
they
chance
to
be
on
the
right
,
they
belong
to
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
I
merely
speak
from
the
plan
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
plan
is
naught
,
sir
,
"
cried
Nowell
,
furiously
,
"
<EOS>
By
what
foul
practice
these
changes
have
been
wrought
<EOS>
I
pretend
not
to
say
,
though
I
can
give
a
good
guess
;
but
the
audacious
witch
who
has
thus
deluded
me
shall
bitterly
rue
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
,
hold
,
Master
Nowell
!
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
I
can
make
great
allowance
for
your
anger
,
which
is
natural
considering
your
disappointment
,
but
I
will
not
permit
such
unwarrantable
insinuations
to
be
thrown
out
against
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
You
agreed
to
abide
by
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
's
award
,
and
you
must
not
complain
if
it
be
made
against
you
.
<EOS>
Do
you
imagine
that
this
stream
can
have
changed
its
course
in
a
single
night
;
or
that
yon
sheepfold
has
been
removed
to
the
further
side
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
do
I
,
"
cried
Potts
;
"
it
has
been
accomplished
by
the
aid
of--
"
 
But
feeling
himself
checked
by
a
glance
from
the
reeve
,
he
stammered
out
,
"
of
--
of
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
declared
just
now
that
marks
,
meres
,
and
boundaries
,
were
unremovable
,
Master
Potts
,
"
said
the
reeve
,
with
a
sneer
;
"
you
have
altered
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
crestfallen
attorney
was
dumb
.
 
<EOS>
"
Master
Roger
Nowell
must
find
some
better
plea
than
the
imputation
of
witchcraft
to
set
aside
Mistress
Nutter
's
claim
,
"
observed
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
,
that
he
mun

"
cried
James
Device
,
and
the
hinds
who
supported
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
magistrate
bit
his
lips
with
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
witchcraft
in
it
<EOS>
,
I
repeat
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
,
that
there
be

"
responded
old
Mitton
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
words
were
scarcely
uttered
,
when
he
was
felled
to
the
ground
by
the
bludgeon
of
James
Device
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'd

said
Jem
,
regarding
Potts
with
a
savage
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
violence
,
Jem
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
authoritatively--"you
do
harm
to
the
cause
you
would
serve
by
your
outrageous
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Beg

Jem

<EOS>
"
No

cried
the
hinds
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
"
are
you
willing
to
concede
the
matter
at
once
,
or
will
you
pursue
the
investigation
further
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
mischief
done
to
me
before
I
stop
,
"
rejoined
the
magistrate
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forward
,
then
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
Our
course
now
lies
along
this
footpath
,
with
a
croft
on
the
left
,
and
an
old
barn
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
Here
the
plans
correspond
,
I
believe
,
Master
Potts
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
attorney
yielded
a
reluctant
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
next
a
small
spring
and
trough
on
the
right
,
and
we
then
come
to
a
limestone
quarry
--
then
by
a
plantation
called
Cat
Gallows
Wood
--
so
named
,
because
some
troublesome
mouser
has
been
hanged
there
,
I
suppose
,
and
next
by
a
deep
moss
-
pit
,
called
Swallow
Hole
.
<EOS>
All
right
,
eh
,
Master
Potts
?
<EOS>
We
shall
now
enter
upon
Worston
Moor
,
and
come
to
the
hut
occupied
by
Jem
Device
,
who
can
,
it
is
presumed
,
speak
positively
as
to
its
situation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
true

cried
Potts
,
as
if
struck
by
an
idea
.
"
<EOS>
Let
the
rascal
step
forward
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
put
a
few
questions
to
him
respecting
his
tenement

<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
catch
him
now

he
added
in
a
low
tone
to
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
ey
be

cried
Jem
,
stepping
up
with
an
insolent
and
defying
look
.
<EOS>
"
Whot
d'ye
want
wi
'
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
First
of
all
I
would
caution
you
to
speak
the
truth

commenced
Potts
,
impressively
,
"
as
I
shall
take
down
your
answers
in
my
memorandum
book
,
and
they
will
be
produced
against
you
hereafter

<EOS>
"
If
he
utters
a

I
will
commit

said
Roger
Nowell

sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
ceevily

an
ey

rejoined
Jem
,
in
a
surly
tone
;
"
boh
ey'm

to
be
browbeaten

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
First
,
then
,
is
your
hut
in
sight
?
"
asked
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neaw
,
"
replied
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
can
point
out
its
situation
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sartinly
ey
con
,
"
replied
Jem
,
without
heeding
a
significant
glance
cast
at
him
by
the
reeve
.
<EOS>
"
It
stonds
behind
yon
kloof
,
ot
soide
o
'
t
'
moor
,
wi
'
a
rindle
in
front
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
mind
what
you
say
,
sirrah
,
"
cried
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
sure
the
hut
is
behind
the
clough
;
and
the
rindle
,
which
,
being
interpreted
from
your
base
vernacular
,
I
believe
means
a
gutter
,
in
front
of
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
reeve
coughed
slightly
,
but
failed
to
attract
Jem
's
attention
,
who
replied
quickly
,
that
he
was
quite
sure
of
the
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Potts--"you
have
all
heard
the
answer
.
<EOS>
He
is
quite
sure
as
to
what
he
states
.
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
I
suppose
you
can
tell
whether
the
hut
looks
to
the
north
or
the
south
;
whether
the
door
opens
to
the
moor
or
to
the
clough
;
and
whether
there
is
a
path
leading
from
it
to
a
spot
called
Hook
Cliff
?
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Jem
caught
the
eye
of
the
reeve
,
and
the
look
given
him
by
the
latter
completely
puzzled
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
dunna
reetly
recollect
which
way
it
looks
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
prevaricating
rascal
,
do
you
pretend
to
say
that
you
do
not
know
which
way
your
own
dwelling
stands
,
"
thundered
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
,
sirrah
,
or
Sparshot
shall
take
you
into
custody
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'm
ready
,
your
worship
,
"
replied
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
,
then
,
"
said
Jem
,
imperfectly
comprehending
the
signs
made
to
him
by
the
reeve
,
"
the
hut
looks
nather
to
t
'
south
naw
to
t
'
north
,
but
to
t
'
west
;
it
feaces
t
'
moor
;
an
there
is
a
path
fro
'
it
to
Hook
Cliff
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
finished
speaking
,
he
saw
from
the
reeve
's
angry
gestures
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
,
but
it
was
now
too
late
to
recall
his
words
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
determined
to
make
an
effort

<EOS>
"
Now
ey
bethink
me

ey'm

sure

"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
sure
,
sirrah
,
"
said
Roger
Nowell
,
bending
his
awful
brows
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
mistaken
as
to
your
own
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Take
down
his
description
,
Master
Potts
,
and
proceed
with
your
interrogatories
if
you
have
any
more
to
put
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
ask
him
whether
he
has
been
at
home
to
-
day
,
"
said
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Answer
,
fellow
,
"
thundered
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
Before
replying
,
Jem
would
fain
have
consulted
the
reeve
,
but
the
latter
had
turned
away
in
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Not
knowing
whether
a
lie
would
serve
his
turn
,
and
fearing
he
might
be
contradicted
by
some
of
the
bystanders
,
he
said
he
had
not
been
at
home
for
two
days
,
but
had
returned
the
night
before
at
a
late
hour
from
Whalley
,
and
had
slept
at
Rough
Lee
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
can
not
tell
what
changes
may
have
taken
place
in
your
dwelling
during
your
absence
?
"
said
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
replied
Jem
,
"
<EOS>
boh
<EOS>
ey

how

"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
,
if
you
do
not
,
sirrah
,
"
said
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
Be
pleased
to
give
me
your
plan
,
Master
Newell
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
further
question
to
ask
him
,
"
he
added
,
after
consulting
it
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
win
awnser
nowt
more
,
"
replied
Jem
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
answer
whatever
questions
Master
Potts
may
put
to
you
,
or
you
are
taken
into
custody
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
would
have
willingly
beaten
a
retreat
;
but
being
surrounded
by
the
two
grooms
and
Sparshot
,
who
only
waited
a
sign
from
Nowell
to
secure
him
,
or
knock
him
down
if
he
attempted
to
fly
,
he
gave
a
surly
intimation
that
he
was
ready
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
aware
that
a
dyke
intersects
the
heath
before
us
,
namely
,
Worston
Moor
?
"
said
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
nodded
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
request
particular
attention
to
your
plan
as
I
proceed
,
Master
Nicholas
,
"
pursued
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
I
now
wish
to
be
informed
by
you
,
James
Device
,
whether
that
dyke
cuts
through
the
middle
of
the
moor
,
or
traverses
the
side
;
and
if
so
,
which
side
?
<EOS>
I
desire
also
to
be
informed
where
it
commences
,
and
where
,
it
ends
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Jem
scratched
his
head
,
and
reflected
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
matter
does
not
require
consideration
,
sirrah
,
"
cried
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
an
instant
answer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
yo
shan
,
"
replied
Jem
;
<EOS>
"
weel
,
then

<EOS>
"
You

"
<EOS>
cried
Potts
,
scarcely
able
to
conceal
his
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Swere

replied
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eigh

"
chorused
the
hinds
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
delighted
to
hear
it
,
"
cried
Potts
,
radiant
with
delight
,
"
<EOS>
for
your
description
corresponds
exactly
with
Master
Nowell
's
plan
,
and
differs
materially
from
that
of
Mistress
Nutter
,
as
Squire
Nicholas
Assheton
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
deny
it
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
in
some
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

the

<EOS>
"
You

"
cried
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
Secure
him

"
he
added
to
the
grooms
and
Sparshot
,
"
and
do
not
let
him
go
till
we
have
completed
the
survey
.
<EOS>
We
will
now
see
how
far
the
reality
corresponds
with
the
description
,
and
what
further
devilish
tricks
have
been
played
with
the
property
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
troop
was
again
put
in
motion
,
James
Device
walking
between
the
two
grooms
,
with
Sparshot
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
wonderfully
elated
was
Master
Potts
by
the
successful
hit
he
had
just
made
,
and
which
,
in
his
opinion
,
quite
counterbalanced
his
previous
failure
,
that
he
could
not
help
communicating
his
satisfaction
to
Flint
,
and
this
in
such
manner
,
that
the
fiery
little
animal
,
who
had
been
for
some
time
exceedingly
tractable
and
good
-
natured
,
took
umbrage
at
it
,
and
threatened
to
dislodge
him
if
he
did
not
desist
from
his
vagaries
--
delivering
the
hint
so
clearly
and
unmistakeably
that
it
was
not
lost
upon
his
rider
,
who
endeavoured
to
calm
him
down
.
<EOS>
In
proportion
as
the
attorney
's
spirits
rose
,
those
of
James
Device
and
his
followers
sank
,
for
they
felt
they
were
caught
in
a
snare
,
from
which
they
could
not
easily
escape
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
the
borders
of
Worston
Moor
,
which
had
been
hitherto
concealed
by
a
piece
of
rising
ground
,
covered
with
gorse
and
brushwood
,
and
Jem
's
hut
,
together
with
the
clough
,
the
rindle
,
and
the
dyke
,
came
distinctly
into
view
.
<EOS>
The
plans
were
again
produced
,
and
,
on
comparing
them
,
it
appeared
that
the
various
landmarks
were
precisely
situated
as
laid
down
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
while
their
disposition
was
entirely
at
variance
with
James
Device
's
statement
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Potts
then
rose
in
his
stirrups
,
and
calling
for
silence
,
addressed
the
assemblage
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
stands
the
hut
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
instead
of
being
behind
the
clough
,
it
is
on
one
side
of
it
,
while
the
door
certainly
does
_
not
_
face
the
moor
,
neither
is
the
rindle
in
front
of
the
dwelling
or
near
it
;
while
the
dyke
,
which
is
the
main
and
important
boundary
line
between
the
properties
,
runs
above
two
hundred
yards
further
west
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
Now
,
observe
the
original
position
of
these
marks
,
meres
,
and
boundaries
--
that
is
,
of
this
hut
,
this
clough
,
this
rindle
,
and
this
dyke
--
exactly
corresponds
with
the
description
given
of
them
by
the
man
Device
,
who
dwells
in
the
place
,
and
who
is
,
therefore
,
a
person
most
likely
to
be
accurately
acquainted
with
the
country
;
and
yet
,
though
he
has
only
been
absent
two
days
,
changes
the
most
surprising
have
taken
place
--
changes
so
surprising
,
indeed
,
that
he
scarcely
knows
the
way
to
his
own
house
,
and
certainly
never
could
find
the
path
which
he
has
described
as
leading
to
Hook
Cliff
,
since
it
is
entirely
obliterated
.
<EOS>
Observe
,
further
,
all
these
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible
changes
in
the
appearance
of
the
country
,
and
in
the
situation
of
the
marks
,
meres
,
and
boundaries
,
are
favourable
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
give
her
the
advantage
she
seeks
over
my
honoured
and
honourable
client
.
<EOS>
They
are
set
down
in
Mistress
Nutter
's
plan
,
it
is
true
;
but
when
,
let
me
ask
,
was
that
plan
prepared
?
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
it
was
prepared
first
,
and
the
changes
in
the
land
made
after
it
by
diabolical
fraud
and
contrivance
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
have
to
declare
this
to
you
,
Master
Nicholas
,
and
to
you
,
Master
Richard
,
but
such
is
my
firm
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
mine
,
also
,
"
added
Nowell
;
"
and
I
here
charge
Mistress
Nutter
with
sorcery
and
witchcraft
,
and
on
my
return
I
will
immediately
issue
a
warrant
for
her
arrest
.
<EOS>
Sparshot
,
I
command
you
to
attach
the
person
of
James
Device
,
for
aiding
and
abetting
her
in
her
foul
practices
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
help
you
to
take
charge
of
him
,
"
said
the
reeve
,
riding
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Probably
this
was
done
to
give
Jem
a
chance
of
escape
,
and
if
so
,
it
was
successful
,
for
as
the
reeve
pushed
among
his
captors
,
and
thrust
Sparshot
aside
,
the
ruffian
broke
from
them
;
and
running
with
great
swiftness
across
the
moor
,
plunged
into
the
clough
,
and
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
and
Richard
instantly
gave
chase
,
as
did
Master
Potts
,
but
the
fugitive
led
them
over
the
treacherous
bog
in
such
a
manner
as
to
baffle
all
pursuit
.
<EOS>
A
second
disaster
here
overtook
the
unlucky
attorney
,
and
damped
him
in
his
hour
of
triumph
.
<EOS>
Flint
,
who
had
apparently
not
forgotten
or
forgiven
the
joyous
kicks
he
had
recently
received
from
the
attorney
's
heels
,
came
to
a
sudden
halt
by
the
side
of
the
quagmire
,
and
,
putting
down
his
head
,
and
flinging
up
his
legs
,
cast
him
into
it
.
<EOS>
While
Potts
was
scrambling
out
,
the
animal
galloped
off
in
the
direction
of
the
clough
,
and
had
just
reached
it
when
he
was
seized
upon
by
James
Device
,
who
suddenly
started
from
the
covert
,
and
vaulted
upon
his
back
.

CHAPTER
VIII.--ROUGH
LEE
.
  
<EOS>
On
returning
from
their
unsuccessful
pursuit
of
James
Device
,
the
two
Asshetons
found
Roger
Nowell
haranguing
the
hinds
,
who
,
on
the
flight
of
their
leader
,
would
have
taken
to
their
heels
likewise
,
if
they
had
not
been
detained
,
partly
by
the
energetic
efforts
of
Sparshot
and
the
grooms
,
and
partly
by
the
exhortations
and
menaces
of
the
magistrate
and
Holden
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
two
or
three
contrived
to
get
away
,
and
fled
across
the
moor
,
whither
the
reeve
pretended
to
pursue
them
;
while
those
left
behind
were
taken
sharply
to
task
by
Roger
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
take
good
heed
to
what
I
say
,
for
it
concerns
you
nearly
.
<EOS>
Strange
and
dreadful
things
have
come
under
my
observation
on
my
way
hither
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
whole
village
stricken
as
by
a
plague
--
a
poor
pedlar
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
and
put
in
peril
of
his
life
--
and
a
young
maiden
,
once
the
pride
and
ornament
of
your
own
village
,
snatched
from
a
fond
father
's
care
,
and
borne
to
an
untimely
grave
.
<EOS>
These
things
I
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
;
and
I
am
resolved
that
the
perpetrators
of
these
enormities
,
Mothers
Demdike
and
Chattox
,
shall
be
brought
to
justice
.
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
the
deluded
victims
of
the
impious
hags
,
I
can
easily
understand
why
you
shut
your
eyes
to
their
evil
doings
.
<EOS>
Terrified
by
their
threats
you
submit
to
their
exactions
,
and
so
become
their
slaves
--
slaves
of
the
bond
-
slaves
of
Satan
.
<EOS>
What
miserable
servitude
is
this
!
<EOS>
By
so
doing
you
not
only
endanger
the
welfare
of
your
souls
,
by
leaguing
with
the
enemies
of
Heaven
,
and
render
yourselves
unworthy
to
be
classed
with
a
religious
and
Christian
people
,
but
you
place
your
lives
in
jeopardy
by
becoming
accessories
to
the
crimes
of
those
great
offenders
,
and
render
yourselves
liable
to
like
punishment
with
them
.
<EOS>
Seeing
,
then
,
the
imminency
of
the
peril
in
which
you
stand
,
you
will
do
well
to
avoid
it
while
there
is
yet
time
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
your
only
risk
.
<EOS>
Your
servitude
to
Mistress
Nutter
is
equally
perilous
.
<EOS>
What
if
she
be
owner
of
the
land
you
till
,
and
the
flocks
you
tend
!
<EOS>
You
owe
her
no
fealty
.
<EOS>
She
has
forfeited
all
title
to
your
service
--
and
,
so
far
from
aiding
her
,
you
ought
to
regard
her
as
a
great
criminal
,
whom
you
are
bound
to
bring
to
justice
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
incontestable
proofs
of
her
dealing
in
the
black
art
,
and
can
show
that
by
witchcraft
she
has
altered
the
face
of
this
country
,
with
the
intent
to
rob
me
of
my
land
.
"
 
<EOS>
Holden
now
took
up
the
theme
.
<EOS>
"
The
finger
of
Heaven
is
pointed
against
such
robbery
,
"
he
cried
.
"
<EOS>
'
Cursed
is
he
,
'
saith
the
scripture
,
'
that
removeth
his
neighbour
's
landmark
.
'
<EOS>
And
again
,
it
is
written
,
'
Cursed
is
he
that
smiteth
his
neighbour
secretly
.
'
<EOS>
Both
these
things
hath
Mistress
Nutter
done
,
and
for
both
shall
she
incur
divine
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
shall
she
escape
that
of
man
,
"
added
Nowell
,
severely
;
"
for
our
sovereign
lord
hath
enacted
that
all
persons
employing
or
rewarding
any
evil
spirit
,
shall
be
held
guilty
of
felony
,
and
shall
suffer
death
.
<EOS>
And
death
will
be
her
portion
,
for
such
demoniacal
agency
<EOS>
most
assuredly
hath
she
employed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
magistrate
here
paused
for
a
moment
to
regard
his
audience
,
and
reading
in
their
terrified
looks
that
his
address
had
produced
the
desired
impression
,
he
continued
with
increased
severity--
 
<EOS>
"
These
wicked
women
shall
trouble
the
land
no
longer
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
arrested
and
brought
to
judgment
;
and
if
you
do
not
heartily
bestir
yourselves
in
their
capture
,
and
undertake
to
appear
in
evidence
against
them
,
you
shall
be
held
and
dealt
with
as
accessories
in
their
crimes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
hinds
,
who
were
greatly
alarmed
,
declared
with
one
accord
their
willingness
to
act
as
the
magistrate
should
direct
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
wisely
,
"
cried
Potts
,
who
by
this
time
had
made
his
way
back
to
the
assemblage
,
covered
from
head
to
foot
with

on
his
former
misadventure

"
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
and
the
two
old
hags
who
hold
you
in
thrall
would
lead
you
to
destruction
.
<EOS>
For
understand
it
is
the
firm
determination
of
my
respected
client
,
Master
Roger
Nowell
,
as
well
as
of
myself
,
not
to
relax
in
our
exertions
till
the
whole
of
these
pestilent
witches
who
trouble
the
country
be
swept
away
,
and
to
spare
none
who
assist
and
uphold
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
hinds
stared
aghast
,
for
so
grim
was
the
appearance
of
the
attorney
,
that
they
almost
thought
Hobthurst
,
the
lubber
-
fiend
,
was
addressing
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
old
Henry
Mitton
came
up
.
<EOS>
He
had
partially
recovered
from
the
stunning
effects
of
the
blow
dealt
him
by
James
Device
,
but
his
head
was
cut
open
,
and
his
white
locks
were
dabbled
in
blood
.
<EOS>
Pushing
his
way
through
the
assemblage
,
he
stood
before
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
yo

a
witness
agen

foul
murtheress
and
witch

"
 
<EOS>
A
thrill
of
horror
pervaded
the
assemblage
at
this
denunciation
;
and
Master
Potts
,
who
was
being
cleansed
from
his
sable
stains
by
one
of
the
grooms
,
cried
out--
 
<EOS>
"
This

said
Potts
;
"
and
,
if

they

<EOS>
"

rejoined
Mitton
;
"

It
be
high

"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
my
worthy
friend
--
very
true
,
"
assented
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
An
immediate
return
to
Whalley
was
now
proposed
by
Nowell
;
but
Master
Potts
was
of
opinion
that
,
as
they
were
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Malkin
Tower
,
they
should
proceed
thither
at
once
,
and
effect
the
arrest
of
Mother
Demdike
,
after
which
Mother
Chattox
could
be
sought
out
and
secured
.
<EOS>
The
presence
of
these
two
witches
would
be
most
important
,
he
declared
,
in
the
examination
of
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
Hue
and
cry
for
the
fugitive
,
James
Device
,
ought
also
to
be
made
throughout
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
Confounded
by
what
they
heard
,
Richard
and
Nicholas
had
hitherto
taken
no
part
in
the
proceedings
,
but
they
now
seconded
Master
Potts
's
proposition
,
hoping
that
the
time
occupied
by
the
visit
to
Malkin
Tower
would
prove
serviceable
to
Mistress
Nutter
;
for
they
did
not
doubt
that
intelligence
would
be
conveyed
to
her
by
some
of
her
agents
,
of
Nowell
's
intention
to
arrest
her
.
 
<EOS>
Additional
encouragement
was
given
to
the
plan
by
the
arrival
of
Richard
Baldwyn
,
who
,
at
this
juncture
,
rode
furiously
up
to
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
,
han
yo
settled
your
business
here
,
Mester
Nowell
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
breathless
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
so
far
settled
it
,
that
we
have
established
proofs
of
witchcraft
against
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
replied
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Can
you
speak
to
her
character

Baldwyn

<EOS>
"
Yeigh

<EOS>
"
You

opportunely

Baldwyn

"
observed
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
just
considering
whether
we
should
go
to
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then

I

take

Baldwyn

said
Potts
;
"
but
I
am
decidedly
of
opinion
that
we
should
go
thither
without
delay

<EOS>
Is
Malkin
Tower
far
off

"
 
<EOS>
"
About
a
mile
fro

Rough
Lee

replied
the
miller
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Go

"
 
<EOS>
"
A

good
suggestion

"
said
Potts
;
"
and
no
doubt
Master
Nowell
will
accede
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
force
enough
already
,
it
appears
to
me
,
"
observed
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Some
dozen
men
,
armed
,
against
a
poor
defenceless
old
woman
,
are
surely
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Owd

rejoined
Baldwyn
.
"
<EOS>
Yo

<EOS>
Malkin

place
,

yo'n

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Nowell
,
"
since
we
are
here
,
I
agree
with
Master
Potts
,
that
it
would
be
better
to
secure
these
two
offenders
,
and
convey
them
to
Whalley
,
where
their
examination
can
be
taken
at
the
same
time
with
that
of
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
We
therefore
accept
your
offer
of
refreshment
,
Baldwyn
,
as
some
of
our
party
may
stand
in
need
of
it
,
and
will
at
once
proceed
to
the
mill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well

said
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
We'n
tae
th

"
cried
Baldwyn
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alive
--
we
must
have
her
alive
,
good
Baldwyn
,
"
said
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
see
her
perish
at
the
stake
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Reet
,
mon
,
"
cried
the
miller
,
his
eyes
blazing
with
fury
;
"
that
's
true
vengeance

<EOS>
Ey'n

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
and
galloped
off
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
was
he
gone
than
the
reeve
,
who
had
kept
out
of
his
sight
,
came
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
have
resolved
upon
going
to
Malkin
Tower
,
"
he
said
to
Nowell
,
"
and
have
a
sufficiently
numerous
party
for
the
purpose
,
my
further
attendance
can
be
dispensed
with
.
<EOS>
I
will
ride
in
search
of
James
Device
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
so
,
"
replied
the
magistrate
,
"
and
let
hue
and
cry
be
made
after
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
,
"
replied
the
reeve
,
"
and
,
if
taken
,
he
shall
be
conveyed
to
Whalley
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
made
towards
the
clough
,
as
if
with
the
intention
of
putting
his
words
into
execution
.
 
<EOS>
Word
was
now
given
to
set
forward
,
and
Master
Potts
having
been
accommodated
with
a
horse
by
one
of
the
grooms
,
who
proceeded
on
foot
,
the
party
began
to
retrace
their
course
to
the
mill
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
soon
again
by
the
side
of
Pendle
Water
,
and
erelong
reached
Rough
Lee
.
<EOS>
As
they
rode
through
the
close
at
the
back
of
the
mansion
,
Roger
Nowell
halted
for
a
moment
,
and
observed
with
a
grim
smile
to
Richard--
 
<EOS>
"
Never
more
shall
Mistress
Nutter
enter
that
house
.
<EOS>
Within
a
week
she
shall
be
lodged
in
Lancaster
Castle
,
as
a
felon
of
the
darkest
dye
,
and
she
shall
meet
a
felon
's
fate
.
<EOS>
And
not
only
shall
she
be
sent
thither
,
but
all
her
partners
in
guilt
--
Mother
Demdike
and
her
accursed
brood
,
the
Devices
;
old
Chattox
and
her
grand
-
daughter
,
Nance
Redferne
:
not
one
shall
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
include
Alizon
Device
in
your
list
?
"
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
include
all
--
I
will
spare
none
,
"
rejoined
Nowell
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
move
no
further
with
you
,
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
!
"
cried
Newell
,
"
are
you
an
upholder
of
these
witches
?
<EOS>
Beware
what
you
do
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
Beware
how
you
take
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
You
will
bring
suspicion
upon
yourself
,
and
get
entangled
in
a
net
from
which
you
will
not
easily
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
what
may
happen
to
me
,
"
rejoined
Richard
;
"
I
will
never
lend
myself
to
gross
injustice
--
such
as
you
are
about
to
practise
.
<EOS>
Since
you
announce
your
intention
of
including
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
,
of
exterminating
a
whole
family
for
the
crimes
of
one
or
two
of
its
members
,
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
dark
accusations
against
Mistress
Nutter
,
but
you
have
proved
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
assert
that
,
by
witchcraft
,
she
has
changed
the
features
of
your
land
,
but
in
what
way
can
you
make
good
the
charge
?
<EOS>
Old
Mitton
has
,
indeed
,
volunteered
himself
as
a
witness
against
her
,
and
has
accused
her
of
most
heinous
offences
;
but
he
has
at
the
same
time
shown
that
he
is
her
enemy
,
and
his
testimony
will
be
regarded
with
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
believe
her
guilty
on
mere
suspicion
,
and
I
deny
that
you
have
aught
more
to
proceed
upon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
argue
the
point
with
you
now
,
sir
,
"
replied
Nowell
;
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
will
be
fairly
tried
,
and
if
I
fail
in
my
proofs
against
her
,
she
will
be
acquitted
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
little
fear
of
such
a
result
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
sinister
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
confident
,
sir
,
because
you
know
there
would
be
every
disposition
to
find
her
guilty
,
"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
be
fairly
tried
.
<EOS>
All
the
prejudices
of
ignorance
and
superstition
,
heightened
by
the
published
opinions
of
the
King
,
will
be
arrayed
against
her
.
<EOS>
Were
she
as
free
from
crime
,
or
thought
of
crime
,
as
the
new
-
born
babe
,
once
charged
with
the
horrible
and
inexplicable
offence
of
witchcraft
,
she
would
scarce
escape
.
<EOS>
You
go
determined
to
destroy
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
deny
it
,
"
said
Roger
Newell
,
"
and
I
am
satisfied
that
I
shall
render
good
service
to
society
by
freeing
it
from
so
vile
a
member
.
<EOS>
So
abhorrent
is
the
crime
of
witchcraft
,
that
were
my
own
son
suspected
,
I
would
be
the
first
to
deliver
him
to
justice
.
<EOS>
Like
a
noxious
and
poisonous
plant
,
the
offence
has
taken
deep
root
in
this
country
,
and
is
spreading
its
baneful
influence
around
,
so
that
,
if
it
be
not
extirpated
,
it
may
spring
up
anew
,
and
cause
incalculable
mischief
.
<EOS>
But
it
shall
now
be
effectually
checked
.
<EOS>
Of
the
families
I
have
mentioned
,
not
one
shall
escape
;
and
if
Mistress
Nutter
herself
had
a
daughter
,
she
should
be
brought
to
judgment
.
<EOS>
In
such
cases
,
children
must
suffer
for
the
sins
of
the
parents
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
regard
,
then
,
for
their
innocence
?
"
said
Richard
,
who
felt
as
if
a
weight
of
calamity
was
crushing
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
Their
innocence
must
be
proved
at
the
proper
tribunal
,
"
rejoined
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
for
me
to
judge
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
judge
them
,
"
cried
Richard
,
sharply
.
"
<EOS>
In
making
the
charge
,
you
know
that
you
pronounce
the
sentence
of
condemnation
as
well
.
<EOS>
This
is
why
the
humane
man
--
why
the
just
--
would
hesitate
to
bring
an
accusation
even
where
he
suspected
guilt
--
but
where
suspicion
could
not
possibly
attach
,
he
would
never
suffer
himself
,
however
urged
on
by
feelings
of
animosity
,
to
injure
the
innocent
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
ascribe
most
unworthy
motives
to
me
,
young
sir
,
"
rejoined
Nowell
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
influenced
only
by
a
desire
to
see
justice
administered
,
and
I
shall
not
swerve
from
my
duty
,
because
my
humanity
may
be
called
in
question
by
a
love
-
sick
boy
.
<EOS>
I
understand
why
you
plead
thus
warmly
for
these
infamous
persons
.
<EOS>
You
are
enthralled
by
the
beauty
of
the
young
witch
,
Alizon
Device
.
<EOS>
I
noted
how
you
were
struck
by
her
yesterday
--
and
I
heard
what
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
said
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
But
take
heed
what
you
do
.
<EOS>
You
may
jeopardise
both
soul
and
body
in
the
indulgence
of
this
fatal
passion
.
<EOS>
Witchcraft
is
exercised
in
many
ways
.
<EOS>
Its
professors
have
not
only
power
to
maim
and
to
kill
,
and
to
do
other
active
mischief
,
but
to
ensnare
the
affections
and
endanger
the
souls
of
their
victims
,
by
enticing
them
to
unhallowed
love
.
<EOS>
Alizon
Device
is
comely
to
view
,
no
doubt
,
but
who
shall
say
whence
her
beauty
is
derived
?
<EOS>
Hell
may
have
arrayed
her
in
its
fatal
charms
.
<EOS>
Sin
is
beautiful
,
but
all
-
destructive
.
<EOS>
And
the
time
will
come
when
you
may
thank
me
for
delivering
you
from
the
snares
of
this
seductive
siren
.
"
<EOS>
Richard
uttered
an
angry
exclamation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
now
--
I
do
not
expect
it
--
you
are
too
much
besotted
by
her
,
"
pursued
Nowell
;
"
but
I
conjure
you
to
cast
off
this
wicked
and
senseless
passion
,
which
,
unless
checked
,
will
lead
you
to
perdition
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
what
abominable
rites
are
practised
at
those
unholy
meetings
called
Devil
's
Sabbaths
,
and
how
can
you
say
that
some
demon
may
not
be
your
rival
in
Alizon
's
love
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
pass
all
licence
,
sir
,
"
cried
Richard
,
infuriated
past
endurance
;
"
and
,
if
you
do
not
instantly
retract
the
infamous
accusation
you
have
made
,
neither
your
age
nor
your
office
shall
protect
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
fortunately
protect
myself
,
young
man
,
"
replied
Nowell
,
coldly
;
"
and
if
aught
were
wanting
to
confirm
my
suspicions
that
you
were
under
some
evil
influence
,
it
would
be
supplied
by
your
present
conduct
.
<EOS>
You
are
bewitched
by
this
girl
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
raised
his
hand
against
the
magistrate
,
when
Nicholas
quickly
interposed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
cousin
Dick
,
"
cried
the
squire
,
"
this
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
other
means
of
defending
the
poor
girl
,
whose
innocence
I
will
maintain
as
stoutly
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
,
since
Master
Roger
Nowell
is
resolved
to
proceed
to
extremities
,
I
shall
likewise
take
leave
to
retire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Nowell
;
"
you
will
not
withdraw
till
I
think
fit
.
<EOS>
Master
Richard
Assheton
,
forgetful
alike
of
the
respect
due
to
age
and
constituted
authority
,
has
ventured
to
raise
his
hand
against
me
,
for
which
,
if
I
chose
,
I
could
place
him
in
immediate
arrest
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
such
intention
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
willing
to
overlook
the
insult
,
attributing
it
to
the
frenzy
by
which
he
is
possessed
.
<EOS>
But
both
he
and
you
,
Master
Nicholas
,
are
mistaken
if
you
suppose
I
will
permit
you
to
retire
.
<EOS>
As
a
magistrate
in
the
exercise
of
my
office
,
I
call
upon
you
both
to
aid
me
in
the
capture
of
the
two
notorious
witches
,
Mothers
Demdike
and
Chattox
,
and
not
to
desist
or
depart
from
me
till
such
capture
be
effected
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
penalty
of
refusal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heavy
fine
or
imprisonment
,
at
the
option
of
the
magistrate
,
"
remarked
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
Nicholas
will
do
as
he
pleases
,
"
observed
Richard
;
"
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
will
not
stir
a
step
further
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
will
I
,
"
added
Nicholas
,
"
unless
I
have
Master
Nowell
's
solemn
pledge
that
he
will
take
no
proceedings
against
Alizon
Device
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
give
no
such
assurance
,
sir
,
"
whispered
Potts
,
seeing
that
the
magistrate
wavered
in
his
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
,
then
,
"
said
Nowell
,
"
and
take
the
consequences
of
your
refusal
to
act
with
me
.
<EOS>
Your
relationship
to
Mistress
Nutter
will
not
tell
in
your
favour
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
the
implied
threat
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
"
and
laugh
at
it
.
<EOS>
Richard
,
lad
,
I
am
with
you
.
<EOS>
Let
him
catch
the
witches
himself
,
if
he
can
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
budge
an
inch
further
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
then
,
gentlemen
,
"
replied
Roger
Nowell
;
"
I
am
sorry
to
part
company
with
you
thus
,
but
when
next
we
meet--
"
and
he
paused
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
meet
as
enemies
,
I
presume
"
supplied
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
meet
no
longer
as
friends
,
"
rejoined
the
magistrate
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
moved
forward
with
the
rest
of
the
troop
,
while
the
two
Asshetons
,
after
a
moment
's
consultation
,
passed
through
a
gate
and
made
their
way
to
the
back
of
the
mansion
,
where
they
found
one
or
two
men
on
the
look
-
out
,
from
whom
they
received
intelligence
,
which
induced
them
immediately
to
spring
from
their
horses
and
hurry
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
principal
entrance
of
the
mansion
,
which
was
formed
by
large
gates
of
open
iron
-
work
,
admitting
a
view
of
the
garden
and
front
of
the
house
,
Roger
Nowell
again
called
a
halt
,
and
Master
Potts
,
at
his
request
,
addressed
the
porter
and
two
other
serving
-
men
who
were
standing
in
the
garden
,
in
this
fashion--
 
<EOS>
"
Pay
attention
to
what
I
say
to
you
,
my
men
,
"
he
cried
in
a
loud
and
authoritative
voice--"a
warrant
<EOS>
will
this
day
be
issued
for
the
arrest
of
Alice
Nutter
of
Rough
Lee
,
in
whose
service
you
have
hitherto
dwelt
,
and
who
is
charged
with
the
dreadful
crime
of
witchcraft
,
and
with
invoking
,
consulting
,
and
covenanting
with
,
entertaining
,
employing
,
feeding
,
and
rewarding
evil
spirits
,
contrary
to
the
laws
of
God
and
man
,
and
in
express
violation
of
his
Majesty
's
statute
.
<EOS>
Now
take
notice
,
that
if
the
said
Alice
Nutter
shall
at
any
time
hereafter
return
to
this
her
former
abode
,
or
take
refuge
within
it
,
you
are
hereby
bound
to
deliver
her
up
forthwith
to
the
nearest
constable
,
to
be
by
him
brought
before
the
worshipful
Master
Roger
Nowell
of
Read
,
in
this
county
,
so
that
she
may
be
examined
by
him
on
these
charges
.
<EOS>
You
hear
what
I
have
said
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
men
exchanged
significant
glances
,
but
made
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Potts
was
about
to
address
them
,
but
to
his
surprise
he
saw
the
central
door
of
the
house
thrown
open
,
and
Mistress
Nutter
issue
from
it
.
<EOS>
She
marched
slowly
and
majestically
down
the
broad
gravel
walk
towards
the
gate
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
,
and
he
exclaimed
to
the
magistrate
with
a
chuckle--
 
<EOS>
"
Who
would
have
thought
of
this
!
<EOS>
We
have
her
safe
enough
now
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
no
corresponding
smile
played
upon
Nowell
's
hard
lips
.
<EOS>
His
gaze
was
fixed
inquiringly
upon
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Another
surprise
.
<EOS>
From
the
same
door
issued
Alizon
Device
,
escorted
by
Nicholas
and
Richard
Assheton
,
who
walked
on
either
side
of
her
,
and
the
three
followed
Mistress
Nutter
slowly
down
the
broad
walk
.
<EOS>
Such
a
display
seemed
to
argue
no
want
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
Alizon
did
not
look
towards
the
group
outside
the
gates
,
but
seemed
listening
eagerly
to
what
Richard
was
saying
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
boldly
,
"
since
you
find
yourself
defeated
in
the
claims
you
have
made
against
my
property
,
you
are
seeking
to
revenge
yourself
,
I
understand
,
by
bringing
charges
against
me
as
false
as
they
are
calumnious
.
<EOS>
But
I
defy
your
malice
,
and
can
defend
myself
against
your
violence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
be
astonished
at
any
thing
in
you
,
madam
,
I
should
be
at
your
audacity
,
"
rejoined
Nowell
,
"
but
I
am
glad
that
you
have
presented
yourself
before
me
;
for
it
was
my
fixed
intention
,
on
my
return
to
Whalley
,
to
cause
your
arrest
,
and
your
unexpected
appearance
here
enables
me
to
put
my
design
into
execution
somewhat
sooner
than
I
anticipated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
laughed
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sparshot
,
"
vociferated
Nowell
,
"
enter
those
gates
,
and
arrest
the
lady
in
the
King
's
name
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
beadle
looked
irresolute
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
like
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gates
are
fastened
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Force
them
open
,
then
,
"
roared
Nowell
,
dismounting
and
shaking
them
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
me
a
heavy
stone
.
<EOS>
By
heaven
I
I
will
not
be
baulked
of
my
prey
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
servants
are
armed
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
the
first
man
who
enters
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
has
rashness
with
life
.
<EOS>
Bring
me
a
petronel
,
Blackadder
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
order
was
promptly
obeyed
by
the
ill
-
favoured
attendant
,
who
was
stationed
near
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
earnest
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
aiming
the
petronel
,
"
and
seldom
miss
my
mark
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
attention
to
me
,
my
men
,
"
cried
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
I
charge
you
in
the
King
's
name
to
throw
open
the
gate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
charge
you
in
mine
to
keep
it
fast
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
who
will
be
obeyed
.
"
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
grooms
now
advanced
with
a
large
stone
taken
from
an
adjoining
wall
,
which
he
threw
with
great
force
against
the
gates
,
but
though
it
shook
them
violently
the
fastenings
continued
firm
.
<EOS>
Blackadder
and
the
two
other
serving
-
men
,
all
of
whom
were
armed
with
halberts
,
now
advanced
to
the
gates
,
and
,
thrusting
the
points
of
their
weapons
through
the
bars
,
drove
back
those
who
were
near
them
.
 
<EOS>
A
short
consultation
now
took
place
between
Nowell
and
Potts
,
after
which
the
latter
,
taking
care
to
keep
out
of
the
reach
of
the
halberts
,
thus
delivered
himself
in
a
loud
voice:--
 
<EOS>
"
Alice
Nutter
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
serious
consequences
which
might
ensue
were
the
necessary
measures
taken
to
effect
a
forcible
entrance
into
your
habitation
,
the
worshipful
Master
Nowell
has
thought
fit
to
grant
you
an
hour
's
respite
for
reflection
;
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
he
trusts
that
you
,
seeing
the
futility
of
resisting
the
law
,
will
quietly
yield
yourself
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
no
further
leniency
will
be
shown
you
and
those
who
may
uphold
you
in
your
contumacy
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
laughed
loudly
and
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
the
same
time
,
"
pursued
Potts
,
on
a
suggestion
from
the
magistrate
,
"
Master
Roger
Nowell
demands
that
Alizon
Device
,
daughter
of
Elizabeth
Device
,
whom
he
beholds
in
your
company
,
and
who
is
likewise
suspected
of
witchcraft
,
be
likewised
delivered
up
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aught
more
?
"
inquired
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
this
,
"
replied
Potts
,
in
a
taunting
tone
,
"
the
worshipful
magistrate
would
offer
a
friendly
counsel
to
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
,
and
Master
Richard
Assheton
,
whom
,
to
his
infinite
surprise
,
he
perceives
in
a
hostile
position
before
him
,
that
they
in
nowise
interfere
with
his
injunctions
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
lend
their
aid
in
furtherance
of
them
,
otherwise
he
may
be
compelled
to
adopt
measures
towards
them
,
which
must
be
a
source
of
regret
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
furthermore
to
state
,
on
the
part
of
his
worship
,
that
strict
watch
will
be
kept
at
all
the
approaches
of
your
house
,
and
that
no
one
,
on
any
pretence
whatever
,
during
the
appointed
time
of
respite
,
will
be
suffered
to
enter
it
,
or
depart
from
it
.
<EOS>
In
an
hour
his
worship
will
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
in
an
hour
he
shall
have
my
answer
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
turning
away
.

CHAPTER
IX.--HOW
ROUGH
LEE
WAS
DEFENDED
BY
NICHOLAS
.
  
<EOS>
When
skies
are
darkest
,
and
storms
are
gathering
thickest
overhead
,
the
star
of
love
will
oft
shine
out
with
greatest
brilliancy
;
and
so
,
while
Mistress
Nutter
was
hurling
defiance
against
her
foes
at
the
gate
,
and
laughing
their
menaces
to
scorn
--
while
those
very
foes
were
threatening
Alizon
's
liberty
and
life
--
she
had
become
wholly
insensible
to
the
peril
environing
her
,
and
almost
unconscious
of
any
other
presence
<EOS>
save
that
of
Richard
,
now
her
avowed
lover
;
for
,
impelled
by
the
irresistible
violence
of
his
feelings
,
the
young
man
had
chosen
that
moment
,
apparently
so
unpropitious
,
and
so
fraught
with
danger
and
alarm
,
for
the
declaration
of
his
passion
,
and
the
offer
of
his
life
in
her
service
.
<EOS>
A
few
low
-
murmured
words
were
all
Alizon
could
utter
in
reply
,
but
they
were
enough
.
<EOS>
They
told
Richard
his
passion
was
requited
,
and
his
devotion
fully
appreciated
.
<EOS>
Sweet
were
those
moments
to
both
--
sweet
,
though
sad
.
<EOS>
Like
Alizon
,
her
lover
had
become
insensible
to
all
around
him
.
<EOS>
Engrossed
by
one
thought
and
one
object
,
he
was
lost
to
aught
else
,
and
was
only
at
last
aroused
to
what
was
passing
by
the
squire
,
who
,
having
good
-
naturedly
removed
to
a
little
distance
from
the
pair
,
now
gave
utterance
to
a
low
whistle
,
to
let
them
know
that
Mistress
Nutter
was
coming
towards
them
.
<EOS>
The
lady
,
however
,
did
not
stop
,
but
motioning
them
to
follow
,
entered
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
what
has
passed
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
In
an
hour
Master
Nowell
threatens
to
return
and
arrest
me
and
Alizon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
shall
never
be
,
"
cried
Richard
,
with
a
passionate
look
at
the
young
girl
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
defend
you
with
our
lives
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Much
may
be
done
in
an
hour
,
"
observed
Nicholas
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
my
advice
to
you
is
to
use
the
time
allowed
you
in
making
good
your
retreat
,
so
that
,
when
the
hawks
come
back
,
they
may
find
the
doves
flown
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
intention
of
quitting
my
dovecot
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
a
bitter
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
are
forcibly
taken
from
it
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
the
squire
;
"
a
contingency
not
impossible
if
you
await
Roger
Nowell
's
return
.
<EOS>
This
time
,
be
assured
,
he
will
not
go
away
empty
-
handed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
not
go
away
at
all
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
mean
to
make
a
determined
resistance
?
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Recollect
that
you
are
resisting
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
induce
you
to
resort
to
the
safer
expedient
of
flight
.
<EOS>
This
affair
is
already
dark
and
perplexed
enough
,
and
does
not
require
further
complication
.
<EOS>
Find
any
place
of
concealment
,
no
matter
where
,
till
some
arrangement
can
be
made
with
Roger
Nowell
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
rather
urge
you
to
fly
,
Nicholas
,
"
rejoined
the
lady
;
"
for
it
is
evident
you
have
strong
misgivings
as
to
the
justice
of
my
cause
,
and
would
not
willingly
compromise
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
surrender
to
this
magistrate
,
because
,
by
so
doing
,
my
life
would
assuredly
be
forfeited
,
for
my
innocence
could
never
be
established
before
the
iniquitous
and
bloody
tribunal
to
which
I
should
be
brought
.
<EOS>
Neither
,
for
the
same
reason
,
will
I
surrender
Alizon
,
who
,
with
a
refinement
of
malignity
,
has
been
similarly
accused
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
proceed
to
make
preparations
for
my
defence
.
<EOS>
Go
,
if
you
think
fitting
--
or
stay
--
but
if
you
_
do
<EOS>
_
stay
<EOS>
,
I
shall
calculate
upon
your
active
services
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
"
replied
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
I
may
think
,
I
admire
your
spirit
,
and
will
stand
by
you
.
<EOS>
But
time
is
passing
,
and
the
foe
will
return
and
find
us
engaged
in
deliberation
when
we
ought
to
be
prepared
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
dozen
men
on
the
premises
on
whom
you
can
rely
.
<EOS>
Half
of
these
must
be
placed
at
the
back
of
the
house
to
prevent
any
entrance
from
being
effected
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
rest
can
remain
within
the
entrance
hall
,
and
be
ready
to
rush
forth
when
summoned
by
us
;
but
we
will
not
so
summon
them
unless
we
are
hardly
put
to
it
,
and
their
aid
is
indispensable
.
<EOS>
All
should
be
well
armed
,
but
I
trust
they
will
not
have
to
use
their
weapons
.
<EOS>
Are
you
agreed
to
this
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
I
will
give
instant
directions
that
your
wishes
are
complied
with
.
<EOS>
All
approaches
to
the
back
of
the
house
shall
be
strictly
guarded
as
you
direct
,
and
my
trusty
man
,
Blackadder
,
on
whose
fidelity
and
courage
<EOS>
I
can
entirely
rely
,
shall
take
the
command
of
the
party
in
the
hall
,
and
act
under
your
orders
.
<EOS>
Your
prowess
will
not
be
unobserved
,
for
Alizon
<EOS>
and
I
shall
be
in
the
upper
room
commanding
the
garden
,
<EOS>
whence
we
can
see
all
that
takes
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
slight
smile
was
exchanged
between
the
lovers
;
but
it
was
evident
,
from
her
anxious
looks
,
that
Alizon
did
not
share
in
Richard
's
confidence
.
<EOS>
An
opportunity
,
however
,
was
presently
afforded
him
of
again
endeavouring
to
reassure
her
,
for
Mistress
Nutter
went
forth
to
give
Blackadder
his
orders
,
and
Nicholas
betook
himself
to
the
back
of
the
house
to
ascertain
,
from
personal
inspection
,
its
chance
of
security
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
still
uneasy
,
dear
Alizon
,
"
said
Richard
,
taking
her
hand
;
"
but
do
not
be
cast
down
.
<EOS>
No
harm
shall
befall
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
for
myself
I
am
apprehensive
,
"
she
replied
,
"
but
for
you
,
who
are
about
to
expose
yourself
to
needless
risk
in
this
encounter
;
and
,
if
any
thing
should
happen
to
you
,
I
shall
be
for
ever
wretched
.
<EOS>
I
would
<EOS>
far
rather
you
left
me
to
my
fate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
can
you
think
I
would
allow
you
to
be
borne
away
a
captive
to
ignominy
and
certain
destruction
?
"
cried
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
will
shed
my
heart
's
best
blood
before
such
a
calamity
shall
occur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
"
said
Alizon
,
"
I
have
no
means
of
requiting
your
devotion
.
<EOS>
All
I
can
offer
you
in
return
is
my
love
,
and
that
,
I
fear
,
will
prove
fatal
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
not
say
so
,
"
cried
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
this
sad
presentiment
still
haunt
you
?
<EOS>
I
strove
to
chase
it
away
just
now
,
and
hoped
I
had
succeeded
.
<EOS>
You
are
dearer
to
me
than
life
.
<EOS>
Why
,
therefore
,
should
I
not
risk
it
in
your
defence
?
<EOS>
And
why
should
your
love
prove
fatal
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
in
a
tone
of
deepest
anguish
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
feel
as
if
my
destiny
were
evil
;
and
that
,
against
my
will
,
I
shall
drag
those
I
most
love
on
earth
into
the
same
dark
gulf
with
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
greatest
affection
for
your
sister
Dorothy
,
and
yet
I
have
been
the
unconscious
instrument
of
injury
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
you
too
,
Richard
,
who
are
yet
dearer
to
me
,
are
now
put
in
peril
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
I
fear
,
too
,
when
you
know
my
whole
history
,
you
will
think
of
me
as
a
thing
of
evil
,
and
shun
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
mean
you
,
Alizon
?
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Richard
,
I
can
have
no
secrets
from
you
,
"
she
replied
;
"
and
though
I
was
forbidden
to
tell
you
what
I
am
now
about
to
disclose
,
I
will
not
withhold
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
born
in
this
house
,
and
am
the
daughter
of
its
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
only
what
I
guessed
,
Alizon
,
"
rejoined
the
young
man
;
"
but
I
see
nothing
in
this
why
I
should
shun
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
hid
her
face
for
a
moment
in
her
hands
;
and
then
looking
up
,
said
wildly
and
hurriedly
,
"
Would
I
had
never
known
the
secret
of
my
birth
;
or
,
knowing
it
,
had
never
seen
what
I
beheld
last
night
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
behold
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Richard
,
greatly
agitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
to
convince
me
,
that
in
gaining
a
mother
I
was
lost
myself
,
"
replied
Alizon
;
"
for
oh
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
survive
the
shock
of
telling
you
I
am
bound
,
by
ties
that
can
never
be
dissevered
,
to
one
abandoned
alike
of
God
and
man
--
who
has
devoted
herself
to
the
Fiend
!
<EOS>
Pity
me
,
Richard
--
pity
me
,
and
shun
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
's
dreadful
pause
,
which
the
young
man
was
unable
to
break
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
I
not
right
in
saying
my
love
would
be
fatal
to
you
?
"
continued
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Fly
from
me
while
you
can
,
Richard
.
<EOS>
Fly
from
this
house
,
or
you
are
lost
for
ever
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
never
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
stir
without
you
,
"
cried
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
and
escape
all
the
dangers
by
which
you
are
menaced
,
and
leave
your
sinning
parent
to
the
doom
she
so
richly
merits
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
sinful
though
she
be
,
she
is
still
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
leave
her
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
stay
,
I
stay
,
be
the
consequences
<EOS>
what
they
may
,
"
replied
the
young
man
;
"
but
you
have
rendered
my
arm
powerless
by
what
you
have
told
me
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
defend
one
whom
I
know
to
be
guilty
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Therefore
I
urge
you
to
fly
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
reconcile
myself
to
it
thus
,
"
said
Richard--"in
defending
you
,
whom
I
know
to
be
innocent
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
avoid
defending
her
.
<EOS>
The
plea
is
not
a
good
one
,
but
it
will
suffice
to
allay
my
scruples
of
conscience
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Mistress
Nutter
entered
the
hall
,
followed
by
Blackadder
and
three
other
men
,
armed
with
calivers
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
is
ready
,
Richard
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
it
wants
but
<EOS>
a
few
minutes
of
the
appointed
time
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
shrink
from
the
task
you
have
undertaken
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
regarding
him
sharply
;
"
if
so
,
say
so
at
once
,
and
I
will
adopt
my
own
line
of
defence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
shall
be
ready
to
go
forth
in
a
moment
,
"
rejoined
the
young
man
,
glancing
at
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Nicholas
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
replied
the
squire
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
All
is
secure
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
and
the
horses
are
coming
round
.
<EOS>
We
must
mount
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
arose
without
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blackadder
will
attend
to
your
orders
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
he
only
waits
a
sign
from
you
to
issue
forth
with
his
three
companions
,
or
to
fire
through
the
windows
upon
the
aggressors
,
if
you
see
occasion
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
it
will
not
come
to
such
a
pass
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
;
"
a
few
blows
from
these
weapons
will
convince
them
we
are
in
earnest
,
and
will
,
I
hope
,
save
further
trouble
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
he
took
down
a
couple
of
stout
staves
,
and
gave
one
of
them
to
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
then
,
_
preux
chevaliers
_
<EOS>
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
affected
gaiety
;
"
demean
yourselves
valiantly
,
and
remember
that
bright
eyes
will
be
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Alizon
,
to
our
chamber
.
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
did
not
hazard
a
look
at
the
young
girl
as
she
quitted
the
hall
with
her
mother
,
but
followed
the
squire
mechanically
into
the
garden
,
where
they
found
the
horses
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
they
mounted
than
a
loud
hubbub
,
arising
from
the
little
village
,
proclaimed
that
their
opponents
had
arrived
,
and
presently
after
a
large
company
of
horse
and
foot
appeared
at
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
At
sight
of
the
large
force
brought
against
them
,
the
countenance
of
the
squire
lost
its
confident
and
jovial
expression
.
<EOS>
Pie
counted
nearly
forty
men
,
each
of
whom
was
armed
in
some
way
or
other
,
and
began
to
fear
the
affair
would
terminate
awkwardly
,
and
entail
unpleasant
consequences
upon
himself
and
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
therefore
,
by
no
means
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
As
to
Richard
,
he
did
not
dare
to
ask
himself
how
things
would
end
,
neither
did
he
know
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
His
mind
was
in
utter
confusion
,
and
his
breast
oppressed
as
if
by
a
nightmare
.
<EOS>
He
cast
one
look
towards
the
upper
window
,
and
beheld
at
it
the
white
face
of
Mistress
Nutter
,
intently
gazing
at
what
was
going
forward
,
but
Alizon
was
not
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Within
the
last
half
hour
the
sky
had
darkened
,
and
a
heavy
cloud
hung
over
the
house
,
threatening
a
storm
.
<EOS>
Richard
hoped
it
would
come
on
fiercely
and
fast
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Roger
Newell
had
dismounted
and
advanced
to
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
he
cried
,
addressing
the
two
Asshetons
,
"
I
expected
to
find
free
access
given
to
me
and
my
followers
;
but
as
these
gates
are
still
barred
against
me
,
I
call
upon
you
,
as
loyal
subjects
of
the
King
,
not
to
resist
or
impede
the
course
of
law
,
but
to
throw
them
instantly
open
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
unbar
them
yourself
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
give
you
no
help
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
offer
any
opposition
,
I
hope
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
magistrate
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
twenty
to
one
,
or
thereabout
,
"
returned
the
squire
,
with
a
laugh
;
"
we
shall
stand
a
poor
chance
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
other
defensive
and
offensive
preparations
have
been
made
,
I
doubt
not
,
"
said
Nowell
;
"
nay
,
I
descry
some
armed
men
through
the
windows
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Before
coming
to
extremities
,
I
will
make
a
last
appeal
to
you
and
your
kinsman
.
<EOS>
I
have
granted
Mistress
Nutter
and
the
girl
with
her
an
hour
's
delay
,
in
the
hope
that
,
seeing
the
futility
of
resistance
,
they
would
quietly
surrender
.
<EOS>
But
I
find
my
clemency
thrown
away
,
and
undue
advantage
taken
of
the
time
allowed
for
respite
;
therefore
,
I
shall
show
them
no
further
consideration
.
<EOS>
But
to
you
,
my
friends
,
I
would
offer
a
last
warning
.
<EOS>
Forget
not
that
you
are
acting
in
direct
opposition
to
the
law
;
that
we
are
here
armed
with
full
authority
and
power
to
carry
out
our
intentions
;
and
that
all
opposition
on
your
part
will
be
fruitless
,
and
will
be
visited
upon
you
hereafter
with
severe
pains
and
penalties
.
<EOS>
Forget
not
,
also
,
that
your
characters
will
be
irrecoverably
damaged
from
your
connexion
with
parties
charged
with
the
heinous
offence
of
witchcraft
.

not
,
therefore
,
in
the
matter
,
but
go
your
ways
,
or
,
if
you
would
act
as
best
becomes
you
,
aid
me
in
the
arrest
of
the
offenders
.
<EOS>
"

Master
Roger
Nowell
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
walking
his
horse
slowly
towards
the
gate
,
"
as
you
have
given
me
a
caution
,
I
will
give
you
one
in
return
;
and
that
is
,
to
put
a
bridle
on
your
tongue
when
you
address
gentlemen
,
or
,
by
my
fay
,
you
are
likely
to
get
answers
little
to
your
taste
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
that
our
characters
are
likely
to
suffer
in
this
transaction
,
but
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
they
will
not
suffer
so
much
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
who
uses
the
arm
of
the
law
for
purposes
of
private
vengeance
,
and
who
brings
a
false
and
foul
charge
against
his
enemy
,
knowing
that
it
can
not
be
repelled
,
is
not
entitled
to
any
particular
respect
or
honour
.
<EOS>
Thus
have
you
acted
towards
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
Defeated
by
her
in
the
boundary
question
,
without
leaving
its
decision
to
those
to
whom
you
had
referred
it
,
you
instantly
accuse
her
of
witchcraft
,
and
seek
to
destroy
her
,
as
well
as
an
innocent
and
unoffending
girl
,
by
whom
she
is
attended
.
<EOS>
Is
such
conduct
worthy
of
you
,
or
likely
to
redound
to
your
credit
?
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
all
.
<EOS>
Aided
by
your
crafty
and
unscrupulous
ally
,
Master
Potts
,
you
get
together
a
number
of
Mistress
Nutter
's
tenants
,
and
,
by
threats
and
misrepresentations
,
induce
them
to
become
instruments
of
your
vengeance
.
<EOS>
But
when
these
misguided
men
come
to
know
the
truth
of
the
case
--
when
they
learn
that
you
have
no
proofs
whatever
against
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
that
you
are
influenced
solely
by
animosity
to
her
,
they
are
quite
as
likely
to
desert
you
as
to
stand
by
you
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
we
are
determined
to
resist
this
unjust
arrest
,
and
,
at
the
hazard
of
our
lives
,
to
oppose
your
entrance
into
the
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nowell
and
Potts
were
greatly
exasperated
by
this
speech
,
but
they
were
little
prepared
for
its
consequences
.
<EOS>
Many
of
those
who
had
been
induced
to
accompany
them
,
as
has
been
shown
,
wavered
in
their
resolution
of
acting
against
Mistress
Nutter
,
but
they
now
began
to
declare
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Potts
repeated
all
his
former
arguments
.
<EOS>
They
were
no
longer
of
any
avail
.
<EOS>
Of
the
troop
assembled
at
the
gate
more
than
half
marched
off
,
and
shaped
their
course
towards
the
rear
of
the
house
--
with
what
intention
it
was
easy
to
surmise
--
while
of
those
who
remained
<EOS>
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
the
whole
of
them
would
act
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
of
his
oration
was
quite
as
surprising
to
Nicholas
as
to
his
opponents
,
and
,
enchanted
by
the
effect
of
his
eloquence
,
he
could
not
help
glancing
up
at
the
window
,
where
he
perceived
Mistress
Nutter
,
whose
smiles
showed
that
she
was
equally
well
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
that
,
if
any
further
desertions
took
place
,
his
chances
would
be
at
an
end
,
with
a
menacing
gesture
at
the
squire
,
Roger
Nowell
ordered
the
attack
to
commence
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
While
some
of
his
men
,
amongst
whom
were
Baldwyn
and
old
Mitton
,
battered
against
the
gate
with
stones
,
another
party
,
headed
by
Potts
,
scaled
the
walls
,
which
,
though
of
considerable
height
,
presented
no
very
serious
obstacles
in
the
way
of
active
assailants
.
<EOS>
Elevated
on
the
shoulders
of
Sparshot
,
Potts
was
soon
on
the
summit
of
the
wall
,
and
was
about
to
drop
into
the
garden
,
when
he
heard
a
sound
that
caused
him
to
suspend
his
intention
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
about
to
do
,
cousin
Nicholas
?
"
inquired
Richard
,
as
the
word
of
assault
was
given
by
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
loose
Mistress
Nutter
's
stag
-
hounds
upon
them
,
"
replied
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
kept
in
leash
by
a
varlet
stationed
behind
yon
yew
-
tree
hedge
,
who
only
awaits
my
signal
to
let
them
slip
;
and
by
my
faith
it
is
time
he
had
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
applied
a
dog
-
whistle
to
his
lips
,
and
,
blowing
a
loud
call
,
it
was
immediately
answered
by
a
savage
barking
,
and
half
a
dozen
hounds
,
rough
-
haired
,
of
prodigious
size
and
power
,
resembling
in
make
,
colour
,
and
ferocity
,
the
Irish
wolf
-
hound
bounded
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
exclaimed
Nicholas
,
clapping
his
hands
to
encourage
them
:
"
we
could
have
dispersed
the
whole
rout
with
these
assistants
.
<EOS>
Hyke
,
Tristam!--hyke
,
Hubert
!
<EOS>
Upon
them!--upon
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
savage
barking
of
the
hounds
that
had
caught
the
ears
of
the
alarmed
attorney
,
and
made
him
desirous
to
scramble
back
again
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
no
such
easy
matter
.
<EOS>
Sparshot
's
broad
shoulders
were
wanting
to
place
his
feet
upon
,
and
while
he
was
bruising
his
knees
against
the
roughened
sides
of
the
wall
in
vain
attempts
to
raise
himself
to
the
top
of
it
unaided
,
Hubert
's
sharp
teeth
met
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
,
while
those
of
Tristam
were
fixed
in
the
skirts
of
his
doublet
,
and
penetrated
deeply
into
the
flesh
that
filled
it
.
<EOS>
A
terrific
yell
proclaimed
the
attorney
's
anguish
and
alarm
,
and
he
redoubled
his
efforts
to
escape
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
before
it
was
difficult
to
get
up
,
the
feat
was
now
impossible
.
<EOS>
All
he
could
do
was
to
cling
with
desperate
tenacity
to
the
coping
of
the
wall
,
for
he
made
no
doubt
,
if
dragged
down
,
he
should
be
torn
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
Roaring
lustily
for
help
,
he
besought
Nicholas
to
have
compassion
upon
him
;
but
the
squire
appeared
little
moved
by
his
distress
,
and
laughed
heartily
at
his
yells
and
vociferations
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
come
again
on
a
like
errand
,
in
a
hurry
,
I
fancy
Master
Potts
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
good
Master
Nicholas
,
"
rejoined
Potts
;
"
for
pity
's
sake
call
off
these
infernal
hounds
.
<EOS>
They
will
rend
me
asunder
as
they
would
a
fox
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
a
cunning
fox
,
in
good
sooth
,
to
come
hither
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
in
a
taunting
tone
;
"
but
will
you
go
hence
if
I
liberate
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
--
indeed
I
will
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
will
no
more
molest
Mistress
Nutter
?
"
thundered
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
what
you
promise
,
"
roared
Nowell
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
_
not
_
promise
it
,
the
hounds
shall
pull
you
down
,
and
make
a
meal
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
--
I
swear
--
whatever
you
desire
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
terrified
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
The
hounds
were
then
called
off
by
the
squire
,
and
,
nerved
by
fright
,
Potts
sprang
upon
the
wall
,
and
tumbled
over
it
upon
the
other
side
,
alighting
upon
the
head
of
his
respected
and
singular
good
client
,
whom
he
brought
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
all
those
unlucky
persons
who
had
succeeded
in
scaling
the
wall
were
attacked
by
the
hounds
,
and
,
unable
to
stand
against
them
,
were
chased
round
the
garden
,
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Frightened
to
death
,
and
unable
otherwise
to
escape
,
for
the
gate
allowed
them
no
means
of
exit
,
the
poor
wretches
fled
towards
the
terrace
overlooking
Pendle
Water
,
and
,
leaping
into
the
stream
,
gained
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
There
they
were
safe
,
for
the
hounds
were
not
allowed
to
follow
them
further
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
the
garden
was
completely
cleared
of
the
enemy
,
and
Nicholas
and
Richard
were
left
masters
of
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
Leaning
out
of
the
window
,
Mistress
Nutter
laughingly
congratulated
them
on
their
success
,
and
,
as
no
further
disposition
was
manifested
on
the
part
of
Nowell
and
such
of
his
troop
that
remained
to
renew
the
attack
,
the
contest
,
for
the
present
at
least
,
was
supposed
to
be
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
also
,
intimation
had
been
conveyed
by
the
deserters
from
Nowell
's
troop
,
who
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
had
made
their
way
to
the
back
of
the
premises
,
that
they
were
anxious
to
offer
their
services
to
Mistress
Nutter
;
and
,
as
soon
as
this
was
told
her
,
she
ordered
them
to
be
admitted
,
and
descended
to
give
them
welcome
.
<EOS>
Thus
things
wore
a
promising
aspect
for
the
besieged
,
while
the
assailing
party
were
proportionately
disheartened
.
 
<EOS>
Long
ere
this
,
<EOS>
Baldwyn
and
old
Mitton
had
desisted
from
their
attempts
to
break
open
the
gate
,
and
,
indeed
,
rejoiced
that
such
a
barrier
was
interposed
between
them
and
the
hounds
,
whose
furious
onslaughts
they
witnessed
.
<EOS>
A
bolt
was
launched
against
these
four
-
footed
guardians
of
the
premises
by
the
bearer
of
the
crossbow
,
but
the
man
proved
but
an
indifferent
marksman
,
for
,
instead
of
hitting
the
hound
,
he
disabled
one
of
his
companions
who
was
battling
with
him
.
<EOS>
Finding
things
in
this
state
,
and
that
neither
Nowell
nor
Potts
returned
to
their
charge
,
while
their
followers
were
withdrawn
from
before
the
gate
,
Nicholas
thought
he
might
fairly
infer
that
a
victory
had
been
obtained
.
<EOS>
But
,
like
a
prudent
leader
,
he
did
not
choose
to
expose
himself
till
the
enemy
had
absolutely
yielded
,
and
he
therefore
signed
to
Blackadder
and
his
men
to
come
forth
from
the
hall
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
obeyed
,
not
only
by
them
,
but
by
the
seceders
from
the
hostile
troop
,
and
some
thirty
men
issued
from
the
principal
door
,
and
,
ranging
themselves
upon
the
lawn
,
set
up
a
deafening
and
triumphant
shout
,
very
different
from
that
raised
by
the
same
individuals
when
under
the
command
of
Nowell
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
Mistress
Nutter
and
Alizon
appeared
at
the
door
,
and
at
the
sight
of
them
the
shouting
was
renewed
.
 
<EOS>
The
unexpected
turn
in
affairs
had
not
been
without
its
effect
upon
Richard
and
Alizon
,
and
tended
to
revive
the
spirits
of
both
.
<EOS>
The
immediate
danger
by
which
they
were
threatened
had
vanished
,
and
time
was
given
for
the
consideration
of
new
plans
.
<EOS>
Richard
had
been
firmly
resolved
to
take
no
further
part
in
the
affray
than
should
be
required
for
the
protection
of
Alizon
,
and
,
consequently
,
it
was
no
little
satisfaction
to
him
to
reflect
that
the
victory
had
been
accomplished
without
him
,
and
by
means
which
could
not
afterwards
be
questioned
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mistress
Nutter
had
joined
Nicholas
,
and
the
gates
being
unbarred
by
Blackadder
,
they
passed
through
them
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
distance
stood
Roger
Nowell
,
now
altogether
abandoned
,
except
by
his
own
immediate
followers
,
with
Baldwyn
and
old
Mitton
.
<EOS>
Poor
Potts
was
lying
on
the
ground
,
piteously
bemoaning
the
lacerations
<EOS>
his
skin
had
undergone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
have
got
the
worst
of
it
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
as
he
and
Mistress
Nutter
approached
the
discomfited
magistrate
,
"
and
must
own
yourself
fairly
defeated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Defeated
as
I
am
,
I
would
rather
be
in
my
place
than
in
yours
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Nowell
,
sourly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
a
wholesome
lesson
read
you
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
come
hither
to
taunt
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
satisfied
with
the
victory
I
have
obtained
,
and
am
anxious
to
put
an
end
to
the
misunderstanding
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
misunderstanding
with
you
,
madam
,
"
replied
Nowell
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quarrel
with
persons
like
you
.
<EOS>
But
be
assured
,
though
you
may
escape
now
,
a
day
of
reckoning
will
come
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
chief
cause
of
grievance
against
me
<EOS>
,
I
am
aware
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
calmly
,
"
is
,
that
I
have
beaten
you
in
the
matter
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
respecting
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
listen
to
it
,
"
rejoined
Nowell
,
sternly
;
"
I
can
have
no
dealings
with
a
witch
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
his
cloak
was
plucked
behind
by
Potts
,
who
looked
at
him
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Do
not
exasperate
her
.
<EOS>
Hear
what
she
has
got
to
offer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
happy
to
act
as
mediator
between
you
,
if
possible
,
"
observed
Nicholas
;
"
but
in
that
case
I
must
request
you
,
Master
Nowell
,
to
abstain
from
any
offensive
language
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
you
have
to
propose
to
me
,
then
,
madam
!
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
magistrate
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
into
the
house
,
and
you
shall
hear
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
Nowell
was
about
to
refuse
peremptorily
,
when
his
cloak
was
again
plucked
by
Potts
,
who
whispered
him
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
a
snare
laid
to
entrap
me
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
regarding
the
lady
suspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
her
good
faith
,
"
interposed
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
Nowell
still
hesitated
,
but
the
counsel
of
his
legal
adviser
was
enforced
by
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
,
which
just
then
began
to
descend
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
take
shelter
beneath
my
roof
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
and
before
the
shower
is
over
we
can
settle
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
my
wounds
can
be
dressed
at
the
same
time
,
"
said
Potts
,
with
a
groan
,
"
for
they
pain
me
sorely
.

Blackadder

sovereign
balsam

which
,
with
a
patch

two
of
diachylon

all

Nicholas
,
unable
to
repress
a
laugh

Here

lift
him
up

you

added
to

him
into

house

<EOS>
The
orders
were
obeyed
,
and
Mistress
Nutter
led
the
way
through
the
now
wide
-
opened
gates
;
her
slow
and
majestic
march
by
no

accelerated
by
the
drenching
shower

Roger
Nowell

sensations
were
at

way

CHAPTER
X.--ROGER
NOWELL
AND
HIS
DOUBLE
.
  
<EOS>
The
magistrate
was
ushered
by
the
lady
into
a
small
chamber
,
opening
out
of
the
entrance
-
hall
,
which
,
in
consequence
of
having
only
one
small
narrow
window
,
with
a
clipped
yew
-
tree
before
it
,
was
extremely
dark
and
gloomy
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
covered
with
sombre
tapestry
,
and
on
entering
,
Mistress
Nutter
not
only
carefully
closed
the
door
,
but
drew
the
arras
before
it
,
so
as
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
their
conversation
being
heard
outside
.
<EOS>
These
precautions
taken
,
she
motioned
the
magistrate
to
a
chair
,
and
seated
herself
opposite
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
now
deal
unreservedly
with
each
other
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
she
said
,
fixing
her
eyes
steadily
upon
him
;
"
and
,
as
our
discourse
can
not
be
overheard
and
repeated
,
may
use
perfect
freedom
of
speech
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
replied
Nowell
,
"
because
it
will
save
circumlocution
,
which
I
dislike
;
and
therefore
,
before
proceeding
further
,
I
must
tell
you
,
directly
and
distinctly
,
that
if
there
be
aught
of
witchcraft
in
what
you
are
about
to
propose
to
me
,
I
will
have
nought
to
do
with
it
,
and
our
conference
may
as
well
never
begin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
really
believe
me
to
be
a
witch
?
"
said
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Nowell
,
unflinchingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
believe
this
,
you
must
also
believe
that
I
have
absolute
power
over
you
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
might
strike
you
with
sickness
,
cripple
you
,
or
kill
you
if
I
thought
fit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
that
,
"
returned
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
limits
even
to
the
power
of
evil
beings
;
and
your
charms
and
enchantments
,
however
strong
and
baneful
,
may
be
wholly
inoperative
against
a
magistrate
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
not
so
,
you
would
scarcely
think
it
worth
while
to
treat
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
exclaimed
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
tell
me
frankly
,
what
you
will
do
when
you
depart
hence
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ride
off
with
the
utmost
speed
to
Whalley
,
"
replied
Nowell
,
"
and
,
acquainting
Sir
Ralph
with
all
that
has
occurred
,
claim
his
assistance
;
and
then
,
with
all
the
force
we
can
jointly
muster
,
return
hither
,
and
finish
the
work
I
have
left
undone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
forego
this
intention
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
a
bitter
smile
.
 
<EOS>
The
magistrate
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
easily
turned
from
my
purpose
,
"
he
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
not
yet
quitted
Rough
Lee
,
"
said
the
lady
,
"
and
after
such
an
announcement
I
shall
scarce
think
of
parting
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
dare
not
detain
me
,
"
replied
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
Nicholas
Assheton
's
word
for
my
security
,
and
I
know
he
will
not
break
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
will
gain
nothing
by
my
detention
.
<EOS>
My
absence
will
soon
be
discovered
,
and
if
living
I
shall
be
set
free
;
if
dead
,
avenged
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
may
,
or
may
not
be
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
and
in
any
case
I
can
,
if
I
choose
,
wreak
my
vengeance
upon
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
have
ascertained
your
intentions
,
for
I
now
know
how
to
treat
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
go
hence
,
except
on
certain
conditions
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
you
will
proclaim
me
a
witch
,
and
will
come
back
with
sufficient
force
to
accomplish
my
arrest
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
doing
this
,
I
advise
you
to
return
to
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
and
admit
to
him
that
you
find
yourself
in
error
in
respect
to
the
boundaries
of
the
land--
"
 
"
Never
,
"
interrupted
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
to
do
this
,
"
pursued
the
lady
,
calmly
,
"
and
I
advise
you
,
also
,
on
quitting
this
room
,
to
retract
all
you
have
uttered
to
my
prejudice
,
in
the
presence
of
Nicholas
Assheton
and
other
credible
witnesses
;
in
which
case
I
will
not
only
lay
aside
all
feelings
of
animosity
towards
you
,
but
will
make
over
to
you
the
whole
of
the
land
under
dispute
,
and
that
without
purchase
money
on
your
part
.
"
 
<EOS>
Roger
Nowell
was
of
an
avaricious
nature
,
and
caught
at
the
bait
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
the
whole
of
the
land
mine
without
payment
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
whole
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
she
should
be
arraigned
and
convicted
it
will
be
forfeited
to
the
crown
,
"
thought
Nowell
;
"
the
offer
is
tempting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
attorney
is
here
,
and
can
prepare
the
conveyance
at
once
,
"
pursued
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
a
sum
can
be
stated
to
lend
a
colour
to
the
proceeding
,
and
I
will
give
you
a
private
memorandum
that
I
will
not
claim
it
.
<EOS>
All
I
require
is
,
that
you
clear
me
completely
from
the
dark
aspersions
cast
upon
my
character
,
and
you
abandon
your
projects
against
my
adopted
daughter
,
Alizon
,
as
well
as
against
those
two
poor
old
women
,
Mothers
Demdike
and
Chattox
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
be
sure
that
I
shall
not
be
deluded
in
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Nowell
;
"
the
writing
may
disappear
from
the
parchment
you
give
me
,
or
the
parchment
itself
may
turn
to
ashes
.
<EOS>
Such
things
have
occurred
in
transactions
with
witches
.
<EOS>
Or
it
be
that
,
by
consenting
to
the
compact
,
I
may
imperil
my
own
soul
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tush
!
"
exclaimed
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
these
are
idle
fears
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
no
idle
threat
on
my
part
,
when
I
tell
you
you
shall
not
go
forth
unless
you
consent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
hinder
me
,
woman
,
"
cried
Nowell
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
,
"
rejoined
the
lady
,
making
two
or
three
rapid
passes
before
him
,
which
instantly
stiffened
his
limbs
,
and
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
motion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
stir
if
you
can
,
"
she
added
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
Nowell
essayed
to
cry
out
,
but
his
tongue
refused
its
office
.
<EOS>
Hearing
and
sight
,
however
,
were
left
him
,
and
he
saw
Mistress
Nutter
take
a
large
volume
,
bound
in
black
,
from
the
shelf
,
and
open
it
at
a
page
covered
with
cabalistic
characters
,
after
which
she
pronounced
some
words
that
sounded
like
an
invocation
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
concluded
,
the
tapestry
against
the
wall
was
raised
,
and
from
behind
it
appeared
a
figure
in
all
respects
resembling
the
magistrate
:
it
had
the
same
sharp
features
,
the
same
keen
eyes
and
bushy
eyebrows
,
the
same
stoop
in
the
shoulders
,
the
same
habiliments
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
short
,
his
double
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
regarded
him
with
a
look
of
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
refuse
,
with
my
injunctions
,
"
she
said
,
"
your
double
will
prove
more
tractable
.
<EOS>
He
will
go
forth
and
do
all
I
would
have
you
do
,
while
I
have
but
to
stamp
upon
the
floor
and
a
dungeon
will
yawn
beneath
your
feet
,
where
you
will
lie
immured
till
doomsday
.
<EOS>
The
same
fate
will
attend
your
crafty
associate
,
Master
Potts
--
so
that
neither
of
you
will
be
missed
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
magistrate
fully
comprehended
his
danger
,
but
he
could
now
neither
offer
remonstrance
nor
entreaty
.
<EOS>
What
was
passing
in
his
breast
seemed
known
to
Mistress
Nutter
;
for
she
motioned
the
double
to
stay
,
and
,
touching
the
brow
of
Nowell
with
the
point
of
her
forefinger
,
instantly
restored
his
power
of
speech
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
a
last
chance
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
obey
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
perforce
,
"
replied
Nowell
:
"
the
contest
is
too
unequal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
retire
,
then
,
"
she
cried
to
the
double
.
<EOS>
And
stepping
backwards
,
the
figure
lifted
up
the
tapestry
,
and
disappeared
behind
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
breathe
,
now
that
infernal
being
is
gone
,
"
cried
Nowell
,
sinking
into
the
chair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
madam
,
you
have
indeed
terrible
power
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
do
well
not
to
brave
it
again
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
summon
Master
Potts
to
prepare
the
conveyance
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
--
no
!
"
cried
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
desire
the
land
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
pay
too
dearly
for
it
.
<EOS>
Only
let
me
get
out
of
this
horrible
place
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
quickly
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
Before
you
go
hence
,
I
must
bind
you
to
the
performance
of
my
injunctions
.
<EOS>
Pronounce
these
words
after
me,--'May
<EOS>
I
become
subject
to
the
Fiend
if
I
fail
in
my
promise
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
utter
them
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nowell
,
shuddering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
recall
your
double
,
"
said
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
,
hold
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
know
what
you
require
of
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
require
absolute
silence
on
your
part
,
as
to
all
you
have
seen
and
heard
here
,
and
cessation
of
hostility
towards
me
and
the
persons
I
have
already
named
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
and
I
require
a
declaration
from
you
,
in
the
presence
of
the
two
Asshetons
,
that
you
are
fully
satisfied
of
the
justice
of
my
claims
in
respect
to
the
land
;
and
that
,
mortified
by
your
defeat
,
you
have
brought
a
false
charge
against
me
,
which
you
now
sincerely
regret
.
<EOS>
This
I
require
from
you
;
and
you
must
ratify
the
promise
by
the
abjuration
I
have
proposed
.
'
<EOS>
May
I
become
subject
to
the
Fiend
if
I
fail
in
my
promise
.
'
"
 
<EOS>
The
magistrate
repeated
the
words
after
her
.
<EOS>
As
he
finished
,
mocking
laughter
,
apparently
resounding
from
below
,
smote
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
triumphantly
;
"
and
now
take
good
heed
that
you
swerve
not
in
the
slightest
degree
from
your
word
,
or
you
are
for
ever
lost
.
"
 
<EOS>
Again
the
mocking
laughter
was
heard
,
and
Nowell
would
have
rushed
forth
,
if
Mistress
Nutter
had
not
withheld
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
"
I
have
not
done
with
you
yet
!
<EOS>
My
witnesses
must
hear
your
declaration
.
<EOS>
Remember
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
placing
her
finger
upon
her
lips
,
in
token
of
silence
,
she
stepped
backwards
,
drew
aside
the
tapestry
,
and
,
opening
the
door
,
called
to
the
two
Asshetons
,
both
of
whom
instantly
came
to
her
,
and
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
learn
that
all
differences
had
been
adjusted
,
and
that
Roger
Nowell
acknowledged
himself
entirely
in
error
,
retracting
all
the
charges
he
had
brought
against
her
;
while
,
on
her
part
,
she
was
fully
satisfied
with
his
explanations
and
apologies
,
and
promised
not
to
entertain
any
feelings
of
resentment
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
up
the
matter
,
indeed
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
"
and
,
as
Master
Roger
Nowell
is
a
widower
,
perhaps
a
match
may
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
Such
an
arrangement"--
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
no
occasion
for
jesting
,
Nicholas
,
"
interrupted
the
lady
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
but
threw
out
a
hint
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
set
the
question
of
the
land
for
ever
at
rest
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
set
at
rest
--
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
replied
the
lady
,
with
a
side
look
at
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
May
I
become
subject
to
the
Fiend
if
I
fail
in
my
promise
,
'
"
repeated
Nowell
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Those
words
bind
me
like
a
chain
of
iron
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
out
of
this
accursed
house
as
fast
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
if
his
thoughts
had
been
divined
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
she
here
observed
to
him
,
"
To
make
our
reconciliation
complete
,
Master
Nowell
,
I
must
entreat
you
to
pass
the
day
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
the
best
entertainment
my
house
affords
--
<EOS>
nay
,
I
will
take
no
denial
;
and
you
too
,
Nicholas
,
and
you
,
Richard
,
you
will
stay
and
keep
the
worthy
magistrate
company
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
two
Asshetons
willingly
assented
,
but
Roger
Nowell
would
fain
have
been
excused
.
<EOS>
A
look
,
however
,
from
his
hostess
enforced
compliance
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
proposal
will
be
highly
agreeable
,
I
am
sure
,
to
Master
Potts
,
"
remarked
Nicholas
,
with
a
laugh
;
"
for
though
much
better
,
in
consequence
of
the
balsam
applied
by
Blackadder
,
he
is
scarcely
in
condition
for
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
warrant
him
well
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
library
with
Parson
Holden
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
making
himself
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
will
permit
,
with
a
flask
of
Rhenish
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
him
,
then
,
"
said
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
<EOS>
what
you
say
to
him
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
,
in
a
low
tone
,
and
raising
her
finger
to
her
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Heaving
a
deep
sigh
,
the
magistrate
then
repaired
to
the
library
,
a
small
room
panelled
with
black
oak
,
and
furnished
with
a
few
cases
of
ancient
tomes
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
and
the
divine
were
seated
at
a
table
,
with
a
big
square
-
built
bottle
and
long
-
stemmed
glasses
before
them
,
and
Master
Potts
,
with
a
wry
grimace
,
excused
himself
from
rising
on
his
respected
and
singular
good
client
's
approach
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
disturb
yourself
,
"
said
Nowell
,
gruffly
;
"
we
shall
not
leave
Rough
Lee
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Potts
,
moving
the
cushions
on
his
chair
and
eyeing
the
square
-
built
bottle
affectionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
to
-
morrow
,
it
may
be
--
nor
the
day
after
--
nor
at
all
,
possibly
,
"
said
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Potts
,
starting
,
and
wincing
with
pain
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
,
worthy
sir
?
"
 
"
'
May
I
become
the
subject
of
the
Fiend
if
I
fail
in
my
promise
,
'
"
rejoined
Nowell
,
with
a
groan
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
promise
,
worshipful
sir
?
"
cried
Potts
,
staring
with
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
The
magistrate
got
out
the
words
,
"
My
promise
to--
"
and
then
he
stopped
suddenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
Mistress
Nutter
?
"
suggested
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
,
"
exclaimed
Nowell
,
fiercely
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
draw
any
erroneous
conclusions
,
man
.
<EOS>
I
mean
nothing
--
I
say
nothing
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
certainly
bewitched
,
"
observed
Parson
Holden
in
an
under
-
tone
to
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
by
your
advice
<EOS>
I
entered
this
house
,
"
thundered
Nowell
,
"
and
may
all
the
ill
arising
from
it
alight
upon
your
head
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
respected
client
!
"
<EOS>
implored
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
longer
your
client
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
the
infuriated
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"
I
dismiss
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
nought
to
do
with
you
more
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
never
seen
your
ugly
little
face
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
quite
right
,
reverend
sir
,
"
observed
Potts
aside
to
the
divine
;
"
he
is
certainly
bewitched
,
or
he
never
would
behave
in
this
way
to
his
best
friend
.
<EOS>
My
excellent
sir
,
"
he
added
to
Nowell
,
"
I
beseech
you
to
calm
yourself
,
and
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
motive
for
wishing
you
to
comply
with
Mistress
Nutter
's
request
was
this
:
We
were
in
a
dilemma
from
which
there
was
no
escape
,
my
wounded
condition
preventing
me
from
flight
,
and
all
your
followers
being
dispersed
.
<EOS>
Knowing
your
discretion
,
I
apprehended
that
,
finding
the
tables
turned
against
you
,
you
would
not
desire
to
play
a
losing
game
,
and
I
therefore
counselled
apparent
submission
as
the
best
means
of
disarming
your
antagonist
.
<EOS>
Whatever
arrangement
you
have
made
with
Mistress
Nutter
is
neither
morally
nor
legally
binding
upon
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
not
!
"
cried
Nowell
.
"
<EOS>
'
May
I
become
subject
to
the
Fiend
if
I
violate
my
promise
!
'
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
promise
have
you
made
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Potts
and
Holden
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
question
me
,
"
cried
Nowell
;
"
it
is
sufficient
that
I
am
tied
and
bound
by
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
attorney
reflected
a
little
,
and
then
observed
to
Holden
,
"
It
is
evident
some
unfair
practices
have
been
resorted
to
with
our
respected
friend
,
to
extort
a
promise
from
him
which
he
can
not
violate
.
<EOS>
It
is
also
possible
,
from
what
he
let
fall
at
first
,
that
an
attempt
may
be
made
to
detain
us
prisoners
within
this
house
,
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
Master
Nowell
may
have
given
his
word
not
to
go
forth
without
Mistress
Nutter
's
permission
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
I
would
beg
of
you
,
reverend
sir
,
as
an
especial
favour
to
us
both
,
to
ride
over
to
Whalley
,
and
acquaint
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
with
our
situation
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
this
suggestion
was
made
,
Nowell
's
countenance
brightened
up
.
<EOS>
The
expression
was
not
lost
upon
the
attorney
,
who
perceived
he
was
on
the
right
tack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
the
worthy
baronet
,
"
continued
Potts
,
"
that
his
old
and
esteemed
friend
,
Master
Roger
Nowell
,
is
in
great
jeopardy
--
am
I
not
right
,
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
magistrate
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
he
is
forcibly
detained
a
prisoner
,
and
requires
sufficient
force
to
effect
his
immediate
liberation
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
,
also
,
that
Master
Nowell
charges
Mistress
Nutter
with
robbing
him
of
his
land
by
witchcraft
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Nowell
;
"
do
not
tell
him
that
.
<EOS>
I
no
longer
charge
her
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
tell
him
that
I
do
,
"
cried
Potts
;
"
and
that
Master
Nowell
has
strangely
,
very
strangely
,
altered
his
mind
.
"
 
"
'
May
I
become
subject
to
the
Fiend
if
I
violate
my
promise
!
'
"
said
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
tell
him
that
,
"
cried
the
attorney--"tell
him
<EOS>
the
worthy
gentleman
is
constantly
repeating
that
sentence
.
<EOS>
It
will
explain
all
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
reverend
sir
,
let
me
entreat
you
to
set
out
without
delay
,
or
your
departure
may
be
prevented
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
at
once
,
"
said
Holden
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
about
to
quit
the
apartment
,
Mistress
Nutter
appeared
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Confusion
was
painted
on
the
countenances
of
all
three
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whither
go
you
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
demanded
the
lady
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
a
mission
which
can
not
be
delayed
,
madam
,
"
replied
Holden
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
quit
my
house
at
present
,
"
she
rejoined
,
peremptorily
.
"
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
stay
to
dine
with
me
,
and
I
can
not
dispense
with
your
company
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
duty
calls
me
hence
,
"
returned
the
divine
.
<EOS>
"
With
all
thanks
for
your
proffered
hospitality
,
I
must
perforce
decline
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
when
I
command
you
to
stay
,
"
she
rejoined
,
raising
her
hand
;
"
I
am
absolute
mistress
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Not
over
the
servants
of
heaven
,
madam
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
divine
,
taking
a
Bible
from
his
pocket
,
and
placing
it
before
him
.
"
By
this
sacred
volume
I
shield
myself
against
your
spells
,
and
command
you
to
let
me
pass
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
went
forth
,
Mistress
Nutter
,
unable
to
oppose
him
,
shrank
back
.

CHAPTER
XI.--MOTHER
DEMDIKE
.
  
<EOS>
The
heavy
rain
,
which
began
to
fall
as
Roger
Nowell
entered
Rough
Lee
,
had
now
ceased
,
and
the
sun
shone
forth
again
brilliantly
,
making
the
garden
look
so
fresh
and
beautiful
that
Richard
proposed
a
stroll
within
it
to
Alizon
.
<EOS>
The
young
girl
seemed
doubtful
at
first
whether
to
comply
with
the
invitation
;
but
she
finally
assented
,
and
they
went
forth
together
alone
,
for
Nicholas
,
fancying
they
could
dispense
with
his
company
,
only
attended
them
as
far
as
the
door
,
where
he
remained
looking
after
them
,
laughing
to
himself
,
and
wondering
how
matters
would
end
.
"
<EOS>
No
good
will
come
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
"
mused
the
worthy
squire
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
and
I
am
scarcely
doing
right
in
allowing
Dick
to
entangle
himself
in
this
fashion
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
the
use
of
giving
advice
to
a
young
man
who
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
?
<EOS>
He
will
never
listen
to
it
,
and
will
only
resent
interference
.
<EOS>
Dick
must
take
his
chance
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
pointed
out
the
danger
to
him
,
and
if
he
chooses
to
run
headlong
into
the
pit
,
why
,
I
can
not
hinder
him
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
am
not
much
surprised
.
<EOS>
Alizon
's
beauty
is
quite
irresistible
,
and
,
were
all
smooth
and
straightforward
in
her
history
,
there
could
be
no
reason
why
--
pshaw
!
<EOS>
I
am
as
foolish
as
the
lad
himself
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Assheton
,
the
proudest
man
in
the
shire
,
would
disown
his
son
if
he
married
against
his
inclinations
.
<EOS>
No
,
my
pretty
youthful
pair
,
since
nothing
but
misery
awaits
you
,
I
advise
you
to
make
the
most
of
your
brief
season
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
do
so
were
the
case
my
own
.
"
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
objects
of
these
ruminations
had
reached
the
terrace
overlooking
Pendle
Water
,
and
were
pacing
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
along
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
might
be
very
happy
in
this
sequestered
spot
,
Alizon
,
"
observed
Richard
.
"
<EOS>
To
some
persons
it
might
appear
dull
,
but
to
me
,
if
blessed
with
you
,
it
would
be
little
short
of
Paradise
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
Richard
,
"
she
replied
,
forcing
a
smile
,
"
why
conjure
up
visions
of
happiness
which
never
can
be
realised
?
<EOS>
But
even
with
you
I
do
not
think
I
could
be
happy
here
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
about
the
house
which
,
when
I
first
beheld
it
,
filled
me
with
unaccountable
terror
.
<EOS>
Never
since
I
was
a
mere
infant
<EOS>
have
I
been
within
it
till
to
-
day
,
and
yet
it
was
quite
familiar
to
me
--
horribly
familiar
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
hall
in
which
we
stood
together
,
with
its
huge
arched
fireplace
,
and
the
armorial
bearings
upon
it
,
and
could
point
out
the
stone
on
which
were
carved
my
father
's
initials
'
R.N.
,
'
with
the
date
'
1572
.
'
<EOS>
I
knew
the
tapestry
on
the
walls
,
and
the
painted
glass
in
the
long
range
windows
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
old
oak
staircase
,
and
the
gallery
beyond
it
,
and
the
room
to
which
my
mother
led
me
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
portraits
painted
on
the
panels
,
and
at
once
recognised
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
great
carved
oak
bedstead
in
this
room
,
and
the
high
chimney
-
piece
,
and
the
raised
hearthstone
,
and
shuddered
as
I
gazed
at
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
ask
me
how
these
things
could
be
familiar
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
them
repeatedly
in
my
dreams
.
<EOS>
They
have
haunted
me
for
years
,
but
I
only
to
-
day
knew
they
had
an
actual
existence
,
or
were
in
any
way
connected
with
my
own
history
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
that
house
inspired
me
with
a
horror
I
have
not
been
able
to
overcome
;
and
I
have
a
presentiment
that
some
ill
will
befall
me
within
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
never
willingly
dwell
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
warning
voice
within
you
,
which
should
never
be
despised
,
prompts
you
to
quit
it
,
"
cried
Richard
;
"
and
I
also
urge
you
in
like
manner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
vain
,
"
sighed
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
This
terrace
is
beautiful
,
"
she
added
,
as
they
resumed
their
walk
,
"
and
I
shall
often
come
hither
,
if
I
am
permitted
.
<EOS>
At
sunset
,
this
river
,
and
the
woody
heights
above
it
,
must
be
enchanting
;
and
I
do
not
dislike
the
savage
character
of
the
surrounding
scenery
.
<EOS>
It
enhances
,
by
contrast
,
the
beauty
of
this
solitude
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
the
spot
commanded
a
view
of
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
like
my
cousin
Nicholas
,
who
thinks
no
prospect
complete
unless
that
hill
forms
part
of
it
,
"
said
Richard
;
"
but
since
I
find
that
you
will
often
come
hither
at
sunset
,
I
shall
not
despair
of
seeing
and
conversing
with
you
again
,
even
if
I
am
forbidden
the
house
by
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
That
thicket
is
an
excellent
hiding
-
place
,
and
this
stream
is
easily
crossed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
have
no
secret
interviews
,
Richard
,
"
replied
Alizon
;
"
I
shall
come
hither
to
think
of
you
,
but
not
to
meet
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
never
return
to
Rough
Lee
again
--
that
is
,
not
unless
some
change
takes
place
,
which
I
dare
not
anticipate
--
but
,
hist
!
<EOS>
I
am
called
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
voice
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
"
said
Richard--"and
,
hark
!
<EOS>
it
calls
again
.
<EOS>
Who
can
it
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
Jennet
,
"
replied
Alizon
;
"
I
see
her
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
pointed
out
the
little
girl
standing
beside
an
alder
on
the
opposite
bank
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
didna
notice
me
efore
,
Alizon
,
"
cried
Jennet
in
her
sharp
tone
,
and
with
her
customary
provoking
laugh
,
"
boh
ey
seed
yo
plain
enuff
,
an
heer'd
yo
too
;
and
ey
<EOS>
heer'd

Mester

this
thicket

the

Alizon
;

said
Richard
,
about

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
,
"
she

asked

<EOS>
"
On

whispered
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Do

"
 
<EOS>
"
Speak

said
Alizon
,
in
a
tone
of
kind
persuasion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

replied
the

"

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
cross
,
"
observed
Alizon
to
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Those
stones
seem
placed
on
purpose
.
"
 
Upon
this
,
descending
from
the
terrace
to
the
river
's
brink
,
and
springing
lightly
upon
the
first
stone
which
reared
its
head
above
the
foaming
tide
,
she
bounded
to
another
,
and
so
in
an
instant
was
across
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Richard
saw
her
ascend
the
opposite
bank
,
and
approach
Jennet
,
who
withdrew
behind
the
alder
;
and
then
he
fancied
he
perceived
an
old
beldame
,
partly
concealed
by
the
intervening
branches
of
the
tree
,
advance
and
seize
hold
of
her
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
scream
;
and
the
sound
had
scarcely
reached
the
young
man
's
ears
before
he
was
down
the
bank
and
across
the
river
,
but
when
he
reached
the
alder
,
neither
Alizon
,
nor
Jennet
,
nor
the
old
beldame
were
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
The
terrible
conviction
that
she
had
been
carried
off
by
Mother
Demdike
then
smote
him
,
and
though
he
continued
his
search
for
her
among
the
adjoining
bushes
,
it
was
with
fearful
misgivings
.
<EOS>
No
answer
was
returned
to
his
shouts
,
nor
could
he
discover
any
trace
of
the
means
by
which
Alizon
had
been
spirited
away
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
time
spent
in
ineffectual
search
,
uncertain
what
course
to
pursue
,
and
with
a
heart
full
of
despair
,
Richard
crossed
the
river
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
house
,
in
front
of
which
he
found
Mistress
Nutter
and
Nicholas
,
both
of
whom
seemed
surprised
when
they
perceived
he
was
unaccompanied
by
Alizon
.
<EOS>
The
lady
immediately
,
and
somewhat
sharply
,
questioned
him
as
to
what
had
become
of
her
adopted
daughter
,
and
appeared
at
first
to
doubt
his
answer
;
but
at
length
,
unable
to
question
his
sincerity
,
she
became
violently
agitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
poor
girl
has
been
conveyed
away
by
Mother
Demdike
,
"
she
cried
,
"
though
for
what
purpose
I
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
.
<EOS>
The
old
hag
could
not
cross
the
running
water
,
and
therefore
resorted
to
that
stratagem
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
must
not
be
left
in
her
hands
,
madam
,
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
must
not
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
Blackadder
,
whom
I
have
sent
after
Parson
Holden
,
were
here
,
I
would
despatch
him
instantly
to
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
instead
,
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
accept
his
offer
,
"
interposed
Nicholas
;
"
he
will
serve
you
as
well
as
Blackadder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
<EOS>
I
shall
,
madam
,
"
cried
Richard
;
"
if
not
on
your
account
,
on
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
,
with
me
,
"
said
the
lady
,
entering
the
house
,
"
and
I
will
furnish
you
with
that
which
shall
be
your
safeguard
in
the
enterprise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
she
proceeded
to
the
closet
where
her
interview
with
Roger
Nowell
had
been
held
;
and
,
unlocking
an
ebony
cabinet
,
took
from
a
drawer
within
it
a
small
flat
piece
of
gold
,
graven
with
mystic
characters
,
and
having
a
slender
chain
of
the
same
metal
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
Throwing
the
chain
over
Richard
's
neck
,
she
said
,
"
Place
this
talisman
,
which
is
of
sovereign
virtue
,
near
your
heart
,
and
no
witchcraft
shall
have
power
over
you
.
<EOS>
But
be
careful
that
you
are
not
by
any
artifice
deprived
of
it
,
for
the
old
hag
will
soon
discover
that
you
possess
some
charm
to
protect
you
against
her
spells
.
<EOS>
You
are
impatient
to
be
gone
,
but
I
have
not
yet
done
,
"
she
continued
,
taking
down
a
small
silver
bugle
from
a
hook
,
and
giving
it
him
.
"
<EOS>
On
reaching
Malkin
Tower
,
wind
this
horn
thrice
,
and
the
old
witch
will
appear
at
the
upper
window
.
<EOS>
Demand
admittance
in
my
name
,
and
she
will
not
dare
to
refuse
you
;
or
,
if
she
does
,
tell
her
you
know
the
secret
entrance
to
her
stronghold
,
and
will
have
recourse
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
in
case
this
should
be
needful
<EOS>
,
I
will
now
disclose
it
to
you
,
but
you
must
not
use
it
till
other
means
fail
.
<EOS>
When
opposite
the
door
,
which
you
will
find
is
high
up
in
the
building
,
take
ten
paces
to
the
left
,
and
if
you
examine
the
masonry
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
,
you
will
perceive
one
stone
somewhat
darker
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
At
the
bottom
of
this
stone
,
and
concealed
by
a
patch
of
heath
,
you
will
discover
a
knob
of
iron
.
<EOS>
Touch
it
,
and
it
will
give
you
an
opening
to
a
vaulted
chamber
,
whence
you
can
mount
to
the
upper
room
.
<EOS>
Even
then
you
may
experience
some
difficulty
,
but
with
resolution
you
will
surmount
all
obstacles
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fear
of
success
,
madam
,
"
replied
Richard
,
confidently
.
 
<EOS>
And
quitting
her
,
he
proceeded
to
the
stables
,
and
calling
for
his
horse
,
vaulted
into
the
saddle
,
and
galloped
off
towards
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
Fast
as
Richard
rode
up
the
steep
hill
-
side
,
still
faster
did
the
black
clouds
gather
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
No
natural
cause
could
have
produced
so
instantaneous
a
change
in
the
aspect
of
the
sky
,
and
the
young
man
viewed
it
with
uneasiness
,
and
wished
to
get
out
of
the
thicket
in
which
he
was
now
involved
,
before
the
threatened
thunder
-
storm
commenced
.
<EOS>
But
the
hill
was
steep
and
the
road
bad
,
being
full
of
loose
stones
,
and
crossed
in
many
places
by
bare
roots
of
trees
.
<EOS>
Though
ordinarily
surefooted
,
Merlin
stumbled
frequently
,
and
Richard
was
obliged
to
slacken
his
pace
.
<EOS>
It
grew
darker
and
darker
,
and
the
storm
seemed
ready
to
burst
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
smaller
birds
ceased
singing
,
and
screened
themselves
under
the
thickest
foliage
;
the
pie
chattered
incessantly
;
the
jay
screamed
;
the
bittern
flew
past
,
booming
heavily
in
the
air
;
the
raven
croaked
;
the
heron
arose
from
the
river
,
and
speeded
off
with
his
long
neck
stretched
out
;
and
the
falcon
,
who
had
been
hovering
over
him
,
sweeped
sidelong
down
and
sought
shelter
beneath
an
impending
rock
;
the
rabbit
scudded
off
to
his
burrow
in
the
brake
;
and
the
hare
,
erecting
himself
for
a
moment
,
as
if
to
listen
to
the
note
of
danger
,
crept
timorously
off
into
the
long
dry
grass
.
 
<EOS>
It
grew
so
dark
at
last
that
the
road
was
difficult
to
discern
,
and
the
dense
rows
of
trees
on
either
side
assumed
a
fantastic
appearance
in
the
deep
gloom
.
<EOS>
Richard
was
now
more
than
half
-
way
up
the
hill
,
and
the
thicket
had
become
more
tangled
and
intricate
,
and
the
road
narrower
and
more
rugged
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
Merlin
stopped
,
quivering
in
every
limb
,
as
if
in
extremity
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
rider
,
and
right
in
his
path
,
glared
a
pair
of
red
fiery
orbs
,
with
something
dusky
and
obscure
linked
to
them
;
but
whether
of
man
or
beast
he
could
not
distinguish
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
called
to
it
.
<EOS>
No
answer
.
<EOS>
He
struck
spurs
into
the
reeking
flanks
of
his
horse
.
<EOS>
The
animal
refused
to
stir
.
<EOS>
Just
then
there
was
a
moaning
sound
in
the
wood
,
as
of
some
one
in
pain
.
<EOS>
He
turned
in
the
direction
,
shouted
,
but
received
no
answer
.
<EOS>
When
he
looked
back
the
red
eyes
were
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Merlin
moved
forward
of
his
own
accord
,
but
ere
he
had
gone
far
,
the
eyes
were
visible
again
,
glaring
at
the
rider
from
the
wood
.
<EOS>
This
time
they
approached
,
dilating
,
and
increasing
in
glowing
intensity
,
till
they
scorched
him
like
burning
-
glasses
.
<EOS>
Bethinking
him
of
the
talisman
,
Richard
drew
it
forth
.
<EOS>
The
light
was
instantly
extinguished
,
and
the
indistinct
figure
accompanying
it
melted
into
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
Merlin
resumed
his
toilsome
way
,
and
Richard
was
marvelling
that
the
storm
so
long
suspended
its
fury
,
when
the
sky
was
riven
by
a
sudden
blaze
,
and
a
crackling
bolt
shot
down
and
struck
the
earth
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
The
affrighted
steed
reared
aloft
,
and
was
with
difficulty
prevented
from
falling
backwards
upon
his
rider
.
<EOS>
Almost
before
he
could
be
brought
to
his
feet
,
an
awful
peal
of
thunder
burst
overhead
,
and
it
required
Richard
's
utmost
efforts
to
prevent
him
from
rushing
madly
down
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
The
storm
had
now
fairly
commenced
.
<EOS>
Flash
followed
flash
,
and
peal
succeeded
peal
,
without
intermission
.
<EOS>
The
rain
descended
hissing
and
spouting
,
and
presently
ran
down
the
hill
in
a
torrent
,
adding
to
the
horseman
's
other
difficulties
and
dangers
.
<EOS>
To
heighten
the
terror
of
the
scene
,
strange
shapes
,
revealed
by
the
lightning
,
were
seen
flitting
among
the
trees
,
and
strange
sounds
were
heard
,
though
overpowered
by
the
dreadful
rolling
of
the
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
But
Richard
's
resolution
continued
unshaken
,
and
he
forced
Merlin
on
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
proceeded
far
,
however
,
when
the
animal
uttered
a
cry
of
fright
,
and
began
beating
the
air
with
his
fore
hoofs
.
<EOS>
The
lightning
enabled
Richard
to
discern
the
cause
of
this
new
distress
.
<EOS>
Coiled
round
the
poor
beast
's
legs
,
all
whose
efforts
to
disengage
himself
from
the
terrible
assailant
were
ineffectual
,
was
a
large
black
snake
,
seemingly
about
to
plunge
its
poisonous
fangs
into
the
flesh
.
<EOS>
Again
having
recourse
to
the
talisman
,
and
bending
down
,
Richard
stretched
it
towards
the
snake
,
upon
which
the
reptile
instantly
darted
its
arrow
-
shaped
head
against
him
,
but
instead
of
wounding
him
,
its
forked
teeth
encountered
the
piece
of
gold
,
and
,
as
if
stricken
a
violent
blow
,
it
swiftly
untwined
itself
,
and
fled
,
hissing
,
into
the
thicket
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
was
now
obliged
to
dismount
and
lead
his
horse
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
toiled
slowly
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
The
storm
continued
with
unabated
fury
:
the
red
lightning
played
around
him
,
the
brattling
thunder
stunned
him
,
and
the
pelting
rain
poured
down
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
no
more
molested
.
<EOS>
Save
for
the
vivid
flashes
,
it
had
become
dark
as
night
,
but
they
served
to
guide
him
on
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
got
out
of
the
thicket
,
and
trod
upon
the
turf
,
but
it
was
rendered
so
slippery
by
moisture
,
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
feet
,
while
the
lightning
no
longer
aided
him
.
<EOS>
Fearing
he
had
taken
a
wrong
course
,
he
stood
still
,
and
while
debating
with
himself
a
blaze
of
light
illumined
the
wide
heath
,
and
showed
him
the
object
of
his
search
,
Malkin
Tower
,
standing
alone
,
like
a
beacon
,
at
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
's
distance
,
on
the
further
side
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Was
it
disturbed
fancy
,
or
did
he
really
behold
on
the
summit
of
the
structure
a
grisly
shape
resembling
--
if
it
resembled
any
thing
human
--
a
gigantic
black
cat
,
with
roughened
staring
skin
,
and
flaming
eyeballs
?
 
<EOS>
Nerved
by
the
sight
of
the
tower
,
Richard
was
on
his
steed
's
back
in
an
instant
,
and
the
animal
,
having
in
some
degree
recovered
his
spirits
,
galloped
off
with
him
,
and
kept
his
feet
in
spite
of
the
slippery
state
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
Erelong
,
another
flash
showed
the
young
man
that
he
was
drawing
rapidly
near
the
tower
,
and
dismounting
,
he
tied
Merlin
to
a
tree
,
and
hurried
towards
the
unhallowed
pile
.
<EOS>
When
within
twenty
paces
of
it
,
mindful
of
Mistress
Nutter
's
injunctions
,
he
placed
the
bugle
to
his
lips
,
and
winded
it
thrice
.
<EOS>
The
summons
,
though
clear
and
loud
,
sounded
strangely
in
the
portentous
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
last
notes
died
away
,
when
a
light
shone
through
the
dark
red
curtains
hanging
before
a
casement
in
the
upper
part
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
these
were
drawn
aside
,
and
a
face
appeared
,
so
frightful
,
so
charged
with
infernal
wickedness
and
malice
,
that
Richard
's
blood
grew
chill
at
the
sight
.
<EOS>
Was
it
man
or
woman
?
<EOS>
The
white
beard
,
and
the
large
,
broad
,
masculine
character
of
the
countenance
,
seemed
to
denote
the
,
former
,
but
the
garb
was
that
of
a
female
.
<EOS>
The
face
was
at
once
hideous
and
fantastic
--
the
eyes
set
across
--
the
mouth
awry
--
the
right
cheek
marked
by
a
mole
shining
with
black
hair
,
and
horrible
from
its
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
visage
,
and
the
brow
branded
as
if
by
a
streak
of
blood
.
<EOS>
A
black
thrum
cap
constituted
the
old
witch
's
head
-
gear
,
and
from
beneath
it
her
hoary
hair
escaped
in
long
elf
-
locks
.
<EOS>
The
lower
part
of
her
person
was
hidden
from
view
,
but
she
appeared
to
be
as
broad
-
shouldered
as
a
man
,
and
her
bulky
person
was
wrapped
in
a
tawny
-
coloured
robe
.
<EOS>
Throwing
open
the
window
,
she
looked
forth
,
and
demanded
in
harsh
imperious
tones--
 
<EOS>
"
Who
dares
to
summon
Mother
Demdike
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
messenger
from
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
in
her
name
to
demand
the
restitution
of
Alizon
Device
,
whom
thou
hast
forcibly
and
wrongfully
taken
from
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
Device
is
my
grand
-
daughter
,
and
,
as
such
,
belongs
to
me
,
and
not
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
knowest
thou
speakest
false
,
foul
hag
!
"
cried
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alizon
is
no
blood
of
thine
.
<EOS>
Open
the
door
and
cast
down
the
ladder
,
or
I
will
find
other
means
of
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Try
them
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
And
she
closed
the
casement
sharply
,
and
drew
the
curtains
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
reconnoitring
the
building
for
a
moment
,
Richard
moved
quickly
to
the
left
,
and
counting
ten
paces
,
as
directed
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
began
to
search
among
the
thick
grass
growing
near
the
base
of
the
tower
for
the
concealed
entrance
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
any
difference
in
the
colour
of
the
masonry
,
but
he
was
sure
he
could
not
be
far
wrong
,
and
presently
his
hand
came
in
contact
with
a
knob
of
iron
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
it
,
but
it
did
not
yield
to
the
touch
.
<EOS>
Again
more
forcibly
,
but
with
like
ill
success
.
<EOS>
Could
he
be
mistaken
?
<EOS>
He
tried
the
next
stone
,
and
discovered
another
knob
upon
it
,
but
this
was
as
immovable
as
the
first
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
,
and
then
found
that
each
stone
was
alike
,
and
that
if
amongst
the
number
he
had
chanced
upon
the
one
worked
by
the
secret
spring
,
it
had
refused
to
act
.
<EOS>
On
examining
the
structure
so
far
as
he
was
able
to
do
in
the
gloom
,
he
found
he
had
described
the
whole
circle
of
the
tower
,
and
was
about
to
commence
the
search
anew
,
when
a
creaking
sound
was
heard
above
,
and
a
light
streamed
suddenly
down
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
door
had
been
opened
by
the
old
witch
,
and
she
stood
there
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
,
its
yellow
flame
illumining
her
hideous
visage
,
and
short
,
square
,
powerfully
built
frame
.
<EOS>
Her
throat
was
like
that
of
a
bull
;
her
hands
of
extraordinary
size
;
and
her
arms
,
which
were
bare
to
the
shoulder
,
brawny
and
muscular
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
still
outside
?
"
she
cried
in
a
jeering
tone
,
and
with
a
wild
discordant
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Methought
thou
affirmedst
thou
couldst
find
a
way
into
my
dwelling
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
yet
despair
of
finding
it
,
"
replied
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fool
!
"
screamed
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
thee
it
is
in
vain
to
attempt
it
without
my
consent
.
<EOS>
With
a
word
,
I
could
make
these
walls
one
solid
mass
,
without
window
or
outlet
from
base
to
summit
.
<EOS>
With
a
word
,
I
could
shower
stones
upon
thy
head
,
and
crush
thee
to
dust
.
<EOS>
With
a
word
,
I
could
make
the
earth
swallow
thee
up
.
<EOS>
With
a
word
,
I
could
whisk
thee
hence
to
the
top
of
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Dost
fear
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Richard
,
undauntedly
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
word
thou
menacest
me
with
shall
never
be
uttered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
asked
Mother
Demdike
,
derisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
thou
wouldst
not
brave
the
resentment
of
one
whose
power
is
equal
to
thine
own
--
if
not
greater
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Greater
<EOS>
it
is
not
--
neither
equal
,
"
rejoined
the
old
hag
,
haughtily
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
desire
a
quarrel
with
Alice
Nutter
.
<EOS>
Only
let
her
not
meddle
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Once
more
,
art
thou
willing
to
admit
me
?
"
demanded
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
upon
one
condition
,
"
replied
Mother
Demdike
.
"
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
learn
it
anon
.
<EOS>
Stand
aside
while
I
let
down
the
ladder
.
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
obeyed
,
and
a
pair
of
narrow
wooden
steps
dropped
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
mount
,
if
thou
hast
the
courage
,
"
cried
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
was
instantly
beside
her
,
but
she
stood
in
the
doorway
,
and
barred
his
further
progress
with
her
extended
staff
.
<EOS>
Now
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
her
,
he
wondered
at
his
own
temerity
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
human
in
her
countenance
,
and
infernal
light
gleamed
in
her
strangely
-
set
eyes
.
<EOS>
Her
personal
strength
,
evidently
unimpaired
by
age
,
or
preserved
by
magical
art
,
seemed
equal
to
her
malice
;
and
she
appeared
as
capable
of
executing
any
atrocity
,
as
of
conceiving
it
.
<EOS>
She
saw
the
effect
produced
upon
him
,
and
chuckled
with
malicious
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Saw'st
thou
ever
face
like
mine
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wot
not
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
rather
inspire
aversion
and
terror
than
love
.
<EOS>
Love!--foh
!
<EOS>
I
would
rather
see
men
shrink
from
me
,
and
shudder
at
my
approach
,
than
smile
upon
me
and
court
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
freeze
the
blood
in
their
veins
,
than
set
it
boiling
with
passion
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
a
fearful
being
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Richard
,
appalled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fearful
,
am
I
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
old
witch
,
with
renewed
laughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
last
thou
own'st
it
.
<EOS>
Why
,
ay
,
I
_
am
_
fearful
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
wish
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
live
to
plague
mankind
--
to
blight
and
blast
them
--
to
scare
them
with
my
looks
--
to
work
them
mischief
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
let
us
look
at
thee
,
"
she
continued
,
holding
the
lamp
over
him
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
soh?--a
comely
youth
!
<EOS>
And
the
young
maids
doat
upon
thee
,
I
doubt
not
,
and
praise
thy
blooming
cheeks
,
thy
bright
eyes
,
thy
flowing
locks
,
and
thy
fine
limbs
.
<EOS>
I
hate
thy
beauty
,
boy
,
and
would
mar
it!--would
canker
thy
wholesome
flesh
,
dim
thy
lustrous
eyes
,
and
strike
thy
vigorous
limbs
with
palsy
,
till
they
should
shake
like
mine
!
<EOS>
I
am
half
-
minded
to
do
it
,
"
she
added
,
raising
her
staff
,
and
glaring
at
him
with
inconceivable
malignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
,
taking
the
talisman
from
his
breast
,
and
displaying
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
armed
against
thy
malice
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
's
staff
fell
from
her
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
thou
wert
<EOS>
in
some
way
protected
,
"
she
cried
furiously
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
it
is
a
piece
of
gold
--
with
magic
characters
upon
it
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
suddenly
changing
her
tone
;
"
Let
me
look
at
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
seest
it
plain
enough
,
"
rejoined
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
stand
aside
and
let
me
pass
,
for
thou
perceivest
<EOS>
I
have
power
to
force
an
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
--
I
see
it
,
"
replied
Mother
Demdike
,
with
affected
humility
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
is
in
vain
to
struggle
with
thee
,
or
rather
with
the
potent
lady
who
sent
thee
.
<EOS>
Tarry
where
thou
art
,
and
i
will
bring
Alizon
to
thee
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
almost
mistrust
thee
,
"
said
Richard--"but
be
speedy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
scarce
a
moment
,
"
said
the
witch
;
"
but
I
must
warn
thee
that
she
is--
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
--
what
hast
thou
done
to
her
,
thou
wicked
hag
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Richard
,
in
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
distraught
,
"
said
Mother
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Distraught
!
"
echoed
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
thou
canst
easily
cure
her
,
"
said
the
old
hag
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
so
I
can
,
"
cried
Richard
with
sudden
joy--"the
talisman
!
<EOS>
Bring
her
to
me
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
departed
,
leaving
him
in
a
state
of
indescribable
agitation
.
<EOS>
The
walls
of
the
tower
were
of
immense
thickness
,
and
the
entrance
to
the
chamber
towards
which
the
arched
doorway
led
was
covered
by
a
curtain
of
old
arras
,
behind
which
the
hag
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
she
entered
the
room
when
a
scream
was
heard
,
and
Richard
heard
his
own
name
pronounced
by
a
voice
which
,
in
spite
of
its
agonised
tones
,
he
at
once
recognised
.
<EOS>
The
cries
were
repeated
,
and
he
then
heard
Mother
Demdike
call
out
,
"
Come
hither
!
<EOS>
come
hither
!
"
 
<EOS>
Instantly
rushing
forward
and
dashing
aside
the
tapestry
,
he
found
himself
in
a
mysterious
-
looking
circular
chamber
,
with
a
massive
oak
table
in
the
midst
of
it
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
strange
objects
in
the
room
,
but
he
saw
only
Alizon
,
who
was
struggling
with
the
old
witch
,
and
clinging
desperately
to
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
called
to
her
by
name
as
he
advanced
,
but
her
bewildered
looks
proved
that
she
did
not
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
--
dear
Alizon
!
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
free
you
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
place
of
answering
him
she
uttered
a
piercing
scream
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
talisman
,
the
talisman
?
"
cried
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
undo
my
own
work
.
<EOS>
Place
the
chain
round
her
neck
,
and
the
gold
near
her
heart
,
that
she
may
experience
its
full
virtue
.
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
unsuspectingly
complied
with
the
suggestion
of
the
temptress
;
but
the
moment
he
had
parted
with
the
piece
of
gold
<EOS>
the
figure
of
Alizon
vanished
,
the
chamber
was
buried
in
gloom
,
and
,
amidst
a
hubbub
of
wild
laughter
,
he
was
dragged
by
the
powerful
arm
of
the
witch
through
the
arched
doorway
,
and
flung
from
it
to
the
ground
,
the
shock
of
the
fall
producing
immediate
insensibility
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XII.--THE
MYSTERIES
OF
MALKIN
TOWER
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
subterranean
chamber
;
gloomy
,
and
of
vast
extent
;
the
roof
low
,
and
supported
by
nine
ponderous
stone
columns
,
to
which
rings
and
rusty
chains
were
attached
,
still
retaining
the
mouldering
bones
of
those
they
had
held
captive
in
life
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
was
a
gigantic
skeleton
,
quite
entire
,
with
an
iron
girdle
round
the
middle
.
<EOS>
Fragments
of
mortality
were
elsewhere
scattered
about
,
showing
the
numbers
who
had
perished
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
On
either
side
were
cells
closed
by
massive
doors
,
secured
by
bolts
and
locks
.
<EOS>
At
one
end
were
three
immense
coffers
made
of
oak
,
hooped
with
iron
,
and
fastened
by
large
padlocks
.
<EOS>
Near
them
stood
a
large
armoury
,
likewise
of
oak
,
and
sculptured
with
the
ensigns
of
Whalley
Abbey
,
proving
it
had
once
belonged
to
that
establishment
.
<EOS>
Probably
it
had
been
carried
off
by
some
robber
band
.
<EOS>
At
the
opposite
end
of
the
vault
were
two
niches
,
each
occupied
by
a
rough
-
hewn
statue
--
the
one
representing
a
warlike
figure
,
with
a
visage
of
extraordinary
ferocity
,
and
the
other
an
anchoress
,
in
her
hood
and
wimple
,
with
a
rosary
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
On
the
ground
beneath
lay
a
plain
flag
,
covering
the
mortal
remains
of
the
wicked
pair
,
and
proclaiming
them
to
be
Isole
de
Heton
and
Blackburn
,
the
freebooter
.
<EOS>
The
pillars
were
ranged
in
three
lines
,
so
as
to
form
,
with
the
arches
above
them
,
a
series
of
short
passages
,
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
an
altar
,
and
near
it
a
large
caldron
.
<EOS>
In
front
,
elevated
on
a
block
of
granite
,
was
a
marvellous
piece
of
sculpture
,
wrought
in
jet
,
and
representing
a
demon
seated
on
a
throne
.
<EOS>
The
visage
was
human
,
but
the
beard
that
of
a
goat
,
while
the
feet
and
lower
limbs
were
like
those
of
the
same
animal
.
<EOS>
Two
curled
horns
grew
behind
the
ears
,
and
a
third
,
shaped
like
a
conch
,
sprang
from
the
centre
of
the
forehead
,
from
which
burst
a
blue
flame
,
throwing
a
ghastly
light
on
the
objects
surrounding
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
discernible
approach
to
the
vault
was
a
steep
narrow
stone
staircase
,
closed
at
the
top
by
a
heavy
trapdoor
.
<EOS>
Other
outlet
apparently
there
was
none
.
<EOS>
Some
little
air
was
admitted
to
this
foul
abode
through
flues
contrived
in
the
walls
,
the
entrances
to
which
were
grated
,
but
the
light
of
day
never
came
there
.
<EOS>
The
flame
,
however
,
issuing
from
the
brow
of
the
demon
image
,
like
the
lamps
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
disciples
of
the
Rosy
Cross
,
was
ever
-
burning
.
<EOS>
Behind
the
sable
statue
was
a
deep
well
,
with
water
as
black
as
ink
,
wherein
swarmed
snakes
,
and
toads
,
and
other
noxious
reptiles
;
and
as
the
lurid
light
fell
upon
its
surface
it
glittered
like
a
dusky
mirror
,
unless
when
broken
by
the
horrible
things
that
lurked
beneath
,
or
crawled
about
upon
its
slimy
brim
.
<EOS>
But
snakes
and
toads
were
not
the
only
tenants
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
the
steps
squatted
a
monstrous
and
misshapen
animal
,
bearing
some
resemblance
to
a
cat
,
but
as
big
as
a
tiger
.
<EOS>
Its
skin
was
black
and
shaggy
;
its
eyes
glowed
like
those
of
the
hyæna
;
and
its
cry
was
like
that
of
the
same
treacherous
beast
.
<EOS>
Among
the
gloomy
colonnades
other
swart
and
bestial
shapes
could
be
indistinctly
seen
moving
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
abode
of
horror
were
two
human
beings
--
one
,
a
young
maiden
of
exquisite
beauty
;
and
the
other
,
almost
a
child
,
and
strangely
deformed
.
<EOS>
The
elder
,
overpowered
by
terror
,
was
clinging
to
a
pillar
for
support
,
while
the
younger
,
who
might
naturally
be
expected
to
exhibit
the
greatest
alarm
,
appeared
wholly
unconcerned
,
and
derided
her
companion
's
fears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Jennet
!
"
exclaimed
the
elder
of
the
two
,
"
is
there
no
means
of
escape
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Yo
mun
stay
here
till
Granny
Demdike

ye

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
that
the
earth
would
open
and
snatch
me
from
these
horrors
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
My
reason
is
forsaking
me
.
<EOS>
Would
I
could
kneel
and
pray
for
deliverance
!
<EOS>
But
something
prevents
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Reet
!
"
replied
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
os
mitch

"
 
<EOS>
"
Kneel
to
that
idol
--
never
!
"
exclaimed
Alizon
.
<EOS>
And
while
striving
to
call
upon
heaven
for
aid
,
a
sharp
convulsion
seized
her
,
and
deprived
her
of
the
power
of
utterance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
towd
yo
<EOS>
how
it

"
remarked
Jennet
,
who
watched
her
narrowly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Tell

"
<EOS>
inquired
Alizon
,
after
a
brief
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Granny
Demdike
will
tell
yo
that
,
"
replied
the
little
girl
;
"
boh

"
she
added
,
with
a
mocking
laugh
,
"

"
 
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
do
that
without
my
consent
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
"
and
I
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
yield
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
replied
Jennet
,
tauntingly
.
<EOS>
"
Yo

<EOS>
"
Oh

"
cried
Alizon
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo

"
responded
Jennet
,
with
a
loud
unfeeling
laugh
;
"

<EOS>
"
Is

cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
"
Boh

replied
the

,
spitefully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
will
never
be
,
Jennet
,
"
said
Alizon
,
sadly
,
but
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
grandmother
may
immure
me
in
this
dungeon
,
and
scare
away
my
senses
;
but
she
will
never
rob
me
of
my
hopes
of
salvation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
clang
like
that
produced
by
a
stricken
gong
shook
the
vault
;
the
beasts
roared
fiercely
;
the
black
waters
of
the
fountain
bubbled
up
,
and
were
lashed
into
foam
by
the
angry
reptiles
;
and
a
larger
jet
of
flame
than
before
burst
from
the
brow
of
the
demon
statue
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
ha
'
warned
ye
,
Alizon
,
"
said
Jennet
,
alarmed
by
these
demonstrations
;
"
boh
since

"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
stay
with
me
,
stay
with
me
,
Jennet
!
"
shrieked
Alizon
,
"
<EOS>
By
our
past
sisterly
affection
I
implore
you
to
remain
!
<EOS>
You
are
some
protection
to
me
from
these
dreadful
beings
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
dunna

to
protect
yo
<EOS>
onless
yo
<EOS>
do

"
replied
Jennet
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whoy
should
yo
be
better
than
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
why
,
indeed
?
"
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Would
I
had
the
power
to
turn
your
heart
--
to
open
your
eyes
to
evil
--
to
save
you
,
Jennet
.
"
 
<EOS>
These
words
were
followed
by
another
clang
,
louder
and
more
brattling
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
The
solid
walls
of
the
dungeon
were
shaken
,
and
the
heavy
columns
rocked
;
while
,
to
Alizon
's
affrighted
gaze
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
sable
statue
arose
upon
its
ebon
throne
,
and
stretched
out
its
arm
menacingly
towards
her
.
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
was
saved
from
further
terror
by
insensibility
.
 
<EOS>
How
long
she
remained
in
this
condition
she
could
not
tell
,
nor
did
it
appear
that
any
efforts
were
made
to
restore
her
;
but
when
she
recovered
,
she
found
herself
stretched
upon
a
rude
pallet
within
an
arched
recess
,
the
entrance
to
which
was
screened
by
a
piece
of
tapestry
.
<EOS>
On
lifting
it
aside
she
perceived
she
was
no
longer
in
the
vault
,
but
in
an
upper
chamber
,
as
she
judged
,
and
not
incorrectly
,
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
lofty
and
circular
,
and
the
walls
of
enormous
thickness
,
as
shown
by
the
deep
embrasures
of
the
windows
;
in
one
of
which
,
the
outlet
having
been
built
up
,
the
pallet
was
placed
.
<EOS>
A
massive
oak
table
,
two
or
three
chairs
of
antique
shape
,
and
a
wooden
stool
,
constituted
the
furniture
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
stool
was
set
near
the
fireplace
,
and
beside
it
stood
a
strangely
-
fashioned
spinning
-
wheel
,
which
had
apparently
been
recently
used
;
but
neither
the
old
hag
nor
her
grand
-
daughter
were
visible
.
<EOS>
Alizon
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
night
or
day
;
but
a
lamp
was
burning
upon
the
table
,
its
feeble
light
only
imperfectly
illumining
the
chamber
,
and
scarcely
revealing
several
strange
objects
dangling
from
the
huge
beams
that
supported
the
roof
.
<EOS>
Faded
arras
were
hung
against
the
walls
,
representing
in
one
compartment
the
last
banquet
of
Isole
de
Heton
and
her
lover
,
Blackburn
;
in
another
,
the
Saxon
Ughtred
hanging
from
the
summit
of
Malkin
Tower
;
and
in
a
third
,
the
execution
of
Abbot
Paslew
.
<EOS>
The
subjects
were
as
large
as
life
,
admirably
depicted
,
and
evidently
worked
at
wondrous
looms
.
<EOS>
As
they
swayed
to
and
fro
in
the
gusts
,
that
found
entrance
into
the
chamber
through
some
unprotected
loopholes
,
the
figures
had
a
grim
and
ghostly
air
.
 
<EOS>
Weak
,
trembling
,
bewildered
,
Alizon
stepped
forth
,
and
staggering
towards
the
table
sank
upon
a
chair
beside
it
.
<EOS>
A
fearful
storm
was
raging
without
--
thunder
,
lightning
,
deluging
rain
.
<EOS>
Stunned
and
blinded
,
she
covered
her
eyes
,
and
remained
thus
till
the
fury
of
the
tempest
had
in
some
degree
abated
.
<EOS>
She
was
roused
at
length
by
a
creaking
sound
not
far
from
her
,
and
found
it
proceeded
from
a
trapdoor
rising
slowly
on
its
hinges
.
 
<EOS>
A
thrum
cap
first
appeared
above
the
level
of
the
floor
;
then
a
broad
,
bloated
face
,
the
mouth
and
chin
fringed
with
a
white
beard
like
the
whiskers
of
a
cat
;
then
a
thick
,
bull
throat
;
then
a
pair
of
brawny
shoulders
;
then
a
square
,
thick
-
set
frame
;
and
Mother
Demdike
stood
before
her
.
<EOS>
A
malignant
smile
played
upon
her
hideous
countenance
,
and
gleamed
from
her
eyes
--
those
eyes
so
strangely
placed
by
nature
,
as
if
to
intimate
her
doom
,
and
that
of
her
fated
race
,
to
whom
the
horrible
blemish
was
transmitted
.
<EOS>
As
the
old
witch
leaped
heavily
upon
the
ground
,
the
trapdoor
closed
behind
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Soh
,
you
are
better
,
Alizon
,
and
have
quitted
your
couch
<EOS>
,
I
find
,
"
she
cried
,
striking
her
staff
upon
the
floor
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
look
faint
and
feeble
still
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
something
to
revive
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
wondrous
cordial
in
yon
closet
--
a
rare
restorative
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
It
will
make
you
well
<EOS>
the
moment
it
has
passed
your
lips
.
<EOS>
I
will
fetch
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
none
of
it
,
"
replied
Alizon
;
"
I
would
rather
die
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rather
die
!
"
echoed
Mother
Demdike
,
sarcastically
,
"
because
,
forsooth
,
you
are
crossed
in
love
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
have
the
man
of
your
heart
yet
,
if
you
will
only
follow
my
counsel
,
and
do
as
I
bid
you
.
<EOS>
Richard
Assheton
shall
be
yours
,
and
with
your
mother
's
consent
,
provided--
"
 
"
I
understand
the
condition
you
annex
to
the
promise
,
"
interrupted
Alizon
,
"
and
the
terms
upon
which
you
would
fulfil
it
:
<EOS>
but
you
seek
in
vain
to
tempt
me
,
old
woman
.
<EOS>
I
now
comprehend
why
I
am
brought
hither
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
indeed
!
"
exclaimed
the
old
witch
.
"
<EOS>
And
why
is
it
,
then
,
since
you
are
so
quick
-
witted
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
desire
to
make
an
offering
to
the
evil
being
you
serve
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
with
sudden
energy
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
entered
into
some
dark
compact
,
which
compels
you
to
deliver
up
a
victim
in
each
year
to
the
Fiend
,
or
your
own
soul
becomes
forfeit
.
<EOS>
Thus
you
have
hitherto
lengthened
out
your
wretched
life
,
and
you
hope
to
extend
the
term
yet
farther
through
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
this
tale
before
,
but
I
would
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
Now
I
do
.
<EOS>
This
is
why
you
have
stolen
me
from
my
mother
--
have
braved
her
anger
--
and
brought
me
to
this
impious
tower
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
old
hag
laughed
hoarsely
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
tale
thou
hast
heard
respecting
me
is
true
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
_
have
_
a
compact
which
requires
me
to
make
a
proselyte
to
the
power
I
serve
within
each
year
,
and
if
I
fail
in
doing
so
,
I
must
pay
the
penalty
thou
hast
mentioned
.
<EOS>
A
like
compact
exists
between
Mistress
Nutter
and
the
Fiend
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
paused
for
a
moment
,
to
watch
the
effect
of
her
words
on
Alizon
,
and
then
resumed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
mother
would
have
sacrificed
thee
if
thou
hadst
been
left
with
her
;
but
I
have
carried
thee
off
,
because
I
conceive
I
am
best
entitled
to
thee
.
<EOS>
Thou
wert
brought
up
as
my
grand
-
daughter
,
and
therefore
I
claim
thee
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
think
to
deal
with
me
as
if
I
were
a
puppet
in
your
hands
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
marry
,
do
I
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Demdike
,
with
a
scream
of
laughter
,
"
Thou
art
nothing
more
than
a
puppet
--
a
puppet
--
ho
!
ho
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
deem
you
can
dispose
of
my
soul
without
my
consent
?
"
said
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
full
consent
will
be
obtained
,
"
rejoined
the
old
hag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Think
it
not
!
<EOS>
think
it
not
!
"
exclaimed
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
shall
yet
be
delivered
from
this
infernal
bondage
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
notes
of
a
bugle
were
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Saved
!
<EOS>
saved
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
poor
girl
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Richard
come
to
my
rescue
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
know'st
thou
<EOS>
that
?
"
cried
Mother
Demdike
,
with
a
spiteful
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
an
instinct
that
never
deceives
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
as
the
blast
was
again
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
stopped
,
"
said
the
hag
,
waving
her
staff
over
the
maiden
,
and
transfixing
her
where
she
sat
;
after
which
she
took
up
the
lamp
,
and
strode
towards
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
The
few
words
that
passed
between
her
and
Richard
have
been
already
recounted
.
<EOS>
Having
closed
the
casement
and
drawn
the
curtain
before
it
,
Mother
Demdike
traced
a
circle
on
the
floor
,
muttered
a
spell
,
and
then
,
waving
her
staff
over
Alizon
,
restored
her
power
of
speech
and
motion
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Twas
he
!
"
exclaimed
the
young
girl
,
as
soon
as
she
could
find
utterance
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
his
voice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
ay
,
'
twas
<EOS>
he
,
sure
enough
,
"
rejoined
the
beldame
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
come
on
a
fool
's
errand
,
but
he
shall
never
return
from
it
.
<EOS>
Does
Mistress
Nutter
think
I
will
give
up
my
prize
the
moment
I
have
obtained
it
,
for
the
mere
asking
?
<EOS>
Does
she
imagine
she
can
frighten
me
as
she
frightens
others
?
<EOS>
Does
she
know
whom
she
has
to
deal
with
?
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
will
tell
her
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
oldest
,
the
boldest
,
and
the
strongest
of
the
witches
.
<EOS>
No
mystery
of
the
black
art
but
is
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
what
mischief
I
will
,
and
my
desolating
hand
has
been
felt
throughout
this
district
.
<EOS>
You
may
trace
it
like
a
pestilence
.
<EOS>
No
one
has
offended
me
<EOS>
but
I
have
terribly
repaid
him
.
<EOS>
I
rule
over
the
land
like
a
queen
.
<EOS>
I
exact
tributes
,
and
,
if
they
are
not
rendered
,
I
smite
with
a
sharper
edge
than
the
sword
.
<EOS>
My
worship
is
paid
to
the
Prince
of
Darkness
.
<EOS>
This
tower
is
his
temple
,
and
yon
subterranean
chamber
the
place
where
the
mystical
rites
,
which
thou
wouldst
call
impious
and
damnable
,
are
performed
.
<EOS>
Countless
sabbaths
have
I
attended
within
it
;
or
upon
Rumbles
Moor
,
or
on
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
,
or
within
the
ruins
of
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Many
proselytes
have
I
made
;
many
unbaptised
babes
offered
up
in
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
I
am
high
-
priestess
to
the
Demon
,
and
thy
mother
would
usurp
mine
office
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
spare
me
this
horrible
recital
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Alizon
,
vainly
trying
to
shut
out
the
hag
's
piercing
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
spare
thee
nothing
,
"
pursued
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thy
mother
,
I
say
,
would
be
high
-
priestess
in
my
stead
.
<EOS>
There
are
degrees
among
witches
,
as
among
other
sects
,
and
mine
is
the
first
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
would
deprive
me
of
mine
office
;
but
not
till
her
hair
is
as
white
as
mine
,
her
knowledge
equal
to
mine
,
and
her
hatred
of
mankind
as
intense
as
mine
--
not
till
then
shall
she
have
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
in
pity
!
"
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Often
have
I
aided
thy
mother
in
her
dark
schemes
,
"
pursued
the
implacable
hag
;
"
nay
,
no
later
than
last
night
I
obliterated
the
old
boundaries
of
her
land
,
and
erected
new
marks
to
serve
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
strong
exercise
of
power
;
but
the
command
came
to
me
,
and
I
obeyed
it
.
<EOS>
No
other
witch
could
have
achieved
so
much
,
not
even
the
accursed
Chattox
,
and
she
is
next
to
myself
.
<EOS>
And
how
does
thy
mother
purpose
to
requite
me
?
<EOS>
By
thrusting
me
aside
,
and
stepping
into
my
throne
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
in
error
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
scarcely
knowing
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
information
never
fails
me
,
"
replied
the
hag
,
with
a
disdainful
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
plans
are
made
known
to
me
as
soon
as
formed
.
<EOS>
I
have
those
about
her
who
keep
strict
watch
upon
her
actions
,
and
report
them
faithfully
.
<EOS>
I
know
why
she
brought
thee
so
suddenly
to
Rough
Lee
,
though
thou
know'st
it
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
brought
me
there
for
safety
,
"
remarked
the
young
girl
,
hoping
to
allay
the
beldame
's
fury
,
"
and
because
she
herself
desired
to
know
how
the
survey
of
the
boundaries
would
end
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
brought
thee
there
to
sacrifice
thee
to
the
Fiend
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
hag
,
infernal
rage
and
malice
blazing
in
her
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
She
failed
in
propitiating
him
at
the
meeting
in
the
ruined
church
of
Whalley
last
night
,
when
thou
thyself
wert
present
,
and
deliveredst
Dorothy
Assheton
from
the
snare
in
which
she
was
taken
.
<EOS>
And
since
then
all
has
gone
wrong
with
her
.
<EOS>
Having
demanded
from
her
familiar
the
cause
why
all
things
ran
counter
<EOS>
,
she
was
told
she
had
failed
in
the
fulfilment
of
her
promise
--
that
a
proselyte
was
required
--
and
that
thou
alone
wouldst
be
accepted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
exclaimed
Alizon
,
horror
-
stricken
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
thou
!
"
cried
the
hag
.
"
<EOS>
No
choice
was
allowed
her
,
and
the
offering
must
be
made
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
and
painful
struggle
,
thy
mother
consented
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
--
impossible
!
<EOS>
you
deceive
me
,
"
cried
the
wretched
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
thee
she
consented
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Demdike
,
coldly
;
"
and
on
this
she
made
instant
arrangements
to
return
home
,
and
in
spite
--
as
thou
know'st
--
of
Sir
Ralph
and
Lady
Assheton
's
efforts
to
detain
her
,
set
forth
with
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
this
I
know
,
"
observed
Alizon
,
sadly--"and
intelligence
of
our
departure
from
the
Abbey
was
conveyed
to
you
,
I
conclude
,
by
Jennet
,
to
whom
I
bade
adieu
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
right
<EOS>
--
it
was
,
"
returned
the
hag
;
"
but
I
have
yet
more
to
tell
thee
,
for
I
will
lay
the
secrets
of
thy
mother
's
dark
breast
fully
before
thee
.
<EOS>
Her
time
is
wellnigh
run
.
<EOS>
Thou
wert
made
the
price
of
its
extension
.
<EOS>
If
she
fails
in
offering
thee
up
to
-
night
,
and
thou
art
here
in
my
keeping
,
the
Fiend
,
her
master
,
will
abandon
her
,
and
she
will
be
delivered
up
to
the
justice
of
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
covered
her
face
with
horror
.
 
<EOS>
After
awhile
she
looked
up
,
and
exclaimed
,
with
unutterable
anguish--
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
can
not
help
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
unpitying
hag
laughed
derisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
be
utterly
lost
,
"
continued
the
young
girl
.
<EOS>
"
Were
I
near
her
,
I
would
show
her
that
heaven
is
merciful
to
the
greatest
sinner
who
repents
;
and
teach
her
how
to
regain
the
lost
path
to
salvation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
thundered
the
witch
,
shaking
her
huge
hand
at
her
,
and
stamping
her
heavy
foot
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
Such
words
must
not
be
uttered
here
.
<EOS>
They
are
an
offence
to
me
.
<EOS>
Thy
mother
has
renounced
all
hopes
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
baptised
in
the
baptism
of
hell
,
and
branded
on
the
brow
by
the
red
finger
of
its
ruler
,
and
can
not
be
wrested
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
late
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
--
it
never
can
be
too
late
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
even
too
late
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
know'st
not
what
thou
talk'st
about
,
foolish
wench
,
"
rejoined
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
Our
master
would
tear
us
instantly
in
pieces
if
but
a
thought
of
penitence
,
as
thou
callest
it
,
crossed
our
minds
.
<EOS>
We
are
both
doomed
to
an
eternity
of
torture
.
<EOS>
But
thy
mother
will
go
first
--
ay
,
first
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
yielded
thee
up
to
-
night
,
another
term
would
have
been
allowed
her
;
but
as
I
hold
thee
instead
,
the
benefit
of
the
sacrifice
will
be
mine
.
<EOS>
But
,
hist
!
<EOS>
what
was
that
?
<EOS>
The
youth
again
!
<EOS>
Alice
Nutter
must
have
given
him
some
potent
counter
-
charm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
comes
to
deliver
me
,
"
cried
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
Richard
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
arose
,
and
would
have
flown
to
the
window
,
but
Mother
Demdike
waved
her
staff
over
her
,
and
rooted
her
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
there
till
I
require
thee
,
"
chuckled
the
hag
,
moving
,
with
ponderous
footsteps
,
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
After
parleying
with
Richard
,
as
already
related
,
Mother
Demdike
suddenly
returned
to
Alizon
,
and
,
restoring
her
to
sensibility
,
placed
her
hideous
face
close
to
her
,
breathing
upon
her
,
and
uttering
these
words
,
"
<EOS>
Be
<EOS>
thine
eyes
blinded
and
thy
brain
confused
,
so
that
thou
mayst
not
know
him
when
thou
seest
him
,
but
think
him
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
spell
took
instant
effect
.
<EOS>
Alizon
staggered
towards
the
table
,
Richard
was
summoned
,
and
on
his
appearance
the
scene
took
place
which
has
already
been
detailed
,
and
which
ended
in
his
losing
the
talisman
,
and
being
ejected
from
the
tower
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
had
been
rendered
invisible
by
the
old
witch
,
and
was
afterwards
dragged
into
the
arched
recess
by
her
,
where
,
snatching
the
piece
of
gold
from
the
young
girl
's
neck
,
she
exclaimed
triumphantly--
 
"
Now
I
defy
thee
,
Alice
Nutter
.
<EOS>
Thou
canst
never
recover
thy
child
.
<EOS>
The
offering
shall
be
made
to
-
night
,
and
another
year
be
added
to
my
long
term
.
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
groaned
deeply
,
but
,
at
a
gesture
from
the
hag
,
she
became
motionless
and
speechless
.
 
<EOS>
A
dusky
indistinctly
-
seen
figure
hovered
near
the
entrance
of
the
embrasure
.
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
beckoned
it
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Convey
this
girl
to
the
vault
,
and
watch
over
her
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
descend
anon
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
shadowy
arms
enveloped
Alizon
,
the
trapdoor
flew
open
,
and
the
figure
disappeared
with
its
inanimate
burthen
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIII.--THE
TWO
FAMILIARS
.
  
<EOS>
After
seeing
Richard
depart
on
his
perilous
mission
to
Malkin
Tower
,
Mistress
Nutter
retired
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
held
long
and
anxious
self
-
communion
.
<EOS>
The
course
of
her
thoughts
may
be
gathered
from
the
terrible
revelations
made
by
Mother
Demdike
to
Alizon
.
<EOS>
A
prey
to
the
most
agonising
emotions
,
it
may
be
questioned
if
she
could
have
endured
greater
torment
if
her
heart
had
been
consumed
by
living
fire
,
as
in
the
punishment
assigned
to
the
damned
in
the
fabled
halls
of
Eblis
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
remorse
assailed
her
,
and
she
felt
compunction
for
the
evil
she
had
committed
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
her
dark
career
passed
in
review
before
her
.
<EOS>
The
long
catalogue
of
her
crimes
unfolded
itself
like
a
scroll
of
flame
,
and
at
its
foot
were
written
in
blazing
characters
the
awful
words
,
JUDGMENT
AND
CONDEMNATION
!
<EOS>
There
was
no
escape
--
none
!
<EOS>
Hell
,
with
its
unquenchable
fires
and
unimaginable
horrors
,
yawned
to
receive
her
;
and
she
felt
,
with
anguish
and
self
-
reproach
not
to
be
described
,
how
wretched
a
bargain
she
had
made
,
and
how
dearly
the
brief
gratification
of
her
evil
passions
had
been
purchased
at
the
cost
of
an
eternity
of
woe
and
torture
.
 
<EOS>
This
change
of
feeling
had
been
produced
by
her
newly
-
awakened
affection
for
her
daughter
,
long
supposed
dead
,
and
now
restored
to
her
,
only
to
be
snatched
away
again
in
a
manner
which
added
to
the
sharpness
of
the
loss
.
<EOS>
She
saw
herself
the
sport
of
a
juggling
fiend
,
whose
aim
was
to
win
over
her
daughter
's
soul
through
her
instrumentality
,
and
she
resolved
,
if
possible
,
to
defeat
his
purposes
.
<EOS>
This
,
she
was
aware
,
could
only
be
accomplished
by
her
own
destruction
,
but
even
this
dread
alternative
she
was
prepared
to
embrace
.
<EOS>
Alizon
's
sinless
nature
and
devotion
to
herself
had
so
wrought
upon
her
,
that
,
though
she
had
at
first
resisted
the
better
impulses
kindled
within
her
bosom
,
in
the
end
they
completely
overmastered
her
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
<EOS>
,
she
asked
herself
,
too
late
to
repent
?
<EOS>
Was
there
no
way
of
breaking
her
compact
?
<EOS>
She
remembered
to
have
read
of
a
young
man
who
had
signed
away
his
own
soul
,
being
restored
to
heaven
by
the
intercession
of
the
great
reformer
of
the
church
,
Martin
Luther
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
had
heard
of
many
others
,
who
,
on
the
slightest
manifestation
of
penitence
,
had
been
rent
in
pieces
by
the
Fiend
.
<EOS>
Still
the
idea
recurred
to
her
.
<EOS>
Might
not
her
daughter
,
armed
with
perfect
purity
and
holiness
,
with
a
soul
free
from
stain
as
an
unspotted
mirror
;
might
not
she
,
who
had
avouched
herself
ready
to
risk
all
for
her
--
for
she
had
overheard
her
declaration
to
Richard;--might
<EOS>
not
she
be
able
to
work
out
her
salvation
?
<EOS>
Would
confession
of
her
sins
and
voluntary
submission
to
earthly
justice
save
her
?
<EOS>
Alas!--no
.
<EOS>
She
was
without
hope
.
<EOS>
She
had
an
inexorable
master
to
deal
with
,
who
would
grant
her
no
grace
,
except
upon
conditions
she
would
not
assent
to
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
thrown
herself
on
her
knees
,
but
they
refused
to
bend
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
prayed
,
but
the
words
turned
to
blasphemies
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
wept
,
but
the
fountains
of
tears
were
dry
.
<EOS>
The
witch
could
never
weep
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
despair
and
frenzy
,
and
,
like
furies
,
lashed
her
with
whips
of
scorpions
,
goading
her
with
the
memory
of
her
abominations
and
idolatries
,
and
her
infinite
and
varied
iniquities
.
<EOS>
They
showed
her
,
as
in
a
swiftly
-
fleeting
vision
,
all
who
had
suffered
wrong
by
her
,
or
whom
her
malice
had
afflicted
in
body
or
estate
.
<EOS>
They
mocked
her
with
a
glimpse
of
the
paradise
she
had
forfeited
.
<EOS>
She
saw
her
daughter
in
a
beatified
state
about
to
enter
its
golden
portals
,
and
would
have
clung
to
her
robes
in
the
hope
of
being
carried
in
with
her
,
but
she
was
driven
away
by
an
angel
with
a
flaming
sword
,
who
cried
out
,
"
Thou
hast
abjured
heaven
,
and
heaven
rejects
thee
.
<EOS>
Satan
's
brand
is
upon
thy
brow
and
,
unless
it
be
effaced
,
thou
canst
never
enter
here
.
<EOS>
Down
to
Tophet
,
thou
witch
!
"
<EOS>
Then
she
implored
her
daughter
to
touch
her
brow
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
;
and
,
as
the
latter
was
about
to
comply
,
a
dark
demoniacal
shape
suddenly
rose
,
and
,
seizing
her
by
the
hair
,
plunged
with
her
down
--
down
--
millions
of
miles
--
till
she
beheld
a
world
of
fire
appear
beneath
her
,
consisting
of
a
multitude
of
volcanoes
,
roaring
and
raging
like
furnaces
,
boiling
over
with
redhot
lava
,
and
casting
forth
huge
burning
stones
.
<EOS>
In
each
of
these
beds
of
fire
thousands
upon
thousands
of
sufferers
were
writhing
,
and
their
groans
and
lamentations
arose
in
one
frightful
,
incessant
wail
,
too
terrible
for
human
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
Over
this
place
of
torment
the
demon
held
her
suspended
.
<EOS>
She
shrieked
aloud
in
her
agony
,
and
,
shaking
off
the
oppression
,
rejoiced
to
find
the
vision
had
been
caused
by
her
own
distempered
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
storm
,
which
had
obstructed
Richard
as
he
climbed
the
hill
,
had
come
on
,
though
Mistress
Nutter
had
not
noticed
it
;
but
now
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
room
,
and
rousing
herself
she
walked
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
sight
she
beheld
increased
her
alarm
.
<EOS>
Heavy
thunder
-
clouds
rested
upon
the
hill
-
side
,
and
seemed
ready
to
discharge
their
artillery
upon
the
course
which
she
knew
must
be
taken
by
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
chamber
in
which
she
stood
,
it
has
been
said
,
was
large
and
gloomy
,
with
a
wainscoting
of
dark
oak
.
<EOS>
On
one
of
the
panels
was
painted
a
picture
of
herself
in
her
days
of
youth
,
innocence
,
and
beauty
;
and
on
another
,
a
portrait
of
her
unfortunate
husband
,
who
appeared
a
handsome
young
man
,
with
a
stern
countenance
,
attired
in
a
black
velvet
doublet
and
cloak
,
of
the
fashion
of
Elizabeth
's
day
.
<EOS>
Between
these
paintings
stood
a
carved
oak
bedstead
,
with
a
high
tester
and
dark
heavy
drapery
,
opposite
which
was
a
wide
window
,
occupying
almost
the
whole
length
of
the
room
,
but
darkened
by
thick
bars
and
glass
,
crowded
with
armorial
bearings
,
or
otherwise
deeply
dyed
.
<EOS>
The
high
mantelpiece
and
its
carvings
have
been
previously
described
,
as
well
as
the
bloody
hearthstone
,
where
the
tragical
incident
occurred
connected
with
Alizon
's
early
history
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mistress
Nutter
returned
to
the
fireplace
,
a
plaintive
cry
arose
from
it
,
and
starting
--
for
the
sound
revived
terrible
memories
within
her
breast
--
she
beheld
the
ineffaceable
stains
upon
the
flag
traced
out
by
blue
phosphoric
fire
,
while
above
them
hovered
the
shape
of
a
bleeding
infant
.
<EOS>
Horror
-
stricken
,
she
averted
her
gaze
,
but
it
encountered
another
object
,
equally
appalling
--
her
husband
's
portrait
;
or
rather
,
it
would
seem
,
a
phantom
in
its
place
;
for
the
eyes
,
lighted
up
by
infernal
fire
,
glared
at
her
from
beneath
the
frowning
and
contracted
brows
,
while
the
hand
significantly
pointed
to
the
hearthstone
,
on
which
the
sanguinary
stains
had
now
formed
themselves
into
the
fatal
word
"
VENGEANCE
!
"
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
fiery
characters
died
away
,
and
the
portrait
resumed
its
wonted
expression
;
but
ere
Mistress
Nutter
had
recovered
from
her
terror
the
back
of
the
fireplace
opened
,
and
a
tall
swarthy
man
stepped
out
from
it
.
<EOS>
As
he
appeared
,
a
flash
of
lightning
illumined
the
chamber
,
and
revealed
his
fiendish
countenance
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
him
,
the
lady
immediately
regained
her
courage
,
and
addressed
him
in
a
haughty
and
commanding
tone--
 
<EOS>
"
Why
this
intrusion
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
summon
thee
,
and
do
not
require
thee
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
;
"
you
had
never
more
occasion
for
me
than
at
this
moment
;
and
,
so
far
from
intruding
upon
you
,
I
have
avoided
coming
near
you
,
even
though
enjoined
to
do
so
by
my
lord
.
<EOS>
He
is
perfectly
aware
of
the
change
which
has
just
taken
place
in
your
opinions
,
and
the
anxiety
you
now
feel
to
break
the
contract
you
have
entered
into
with
him
,
and
which
he
has
scrupulously
fulfilled
on
his
part
;
but
he
wishes
you
distinctly
to
understand
,
that
he
has
no
intention
of
abandoning
his
claims
upon
you
,
but
will
most
assuredly
enforce
them
at
the
proper
time
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
remind
you
that
your
term
draws
to
a
close
,
and
ere
many
months
must
expire
;
but
means
of
extending
it
have
been
offered
you
,
if
you
choose
to
avail
yourself
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
intention
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
in
a
decided
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
be
it
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
but
you
will
not
preserve
your
daughter
,
who
is
in
the
hands
of
a
tried
and
faithful
servant
of
my
lord
,
and
what
you
hesitate
to
do
that
servant
will
perform
,
and
so
reap
the
benefit
of
the
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
yea
,
"
retorted
the
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
my
slave
<EOS>
,
I
command
thee
to
bring
Alizon
hither
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
familiar
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
refusest
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
menacingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Knows't
thou
<EOS>
not
I
have
the
means
of
chastising
thee
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
but
the
moment
a
thought
of
penitence
crossed
your
breast
,
the
power
you
were
invested
with
departed
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
however
,
is
willing
to
give
you
an
hour
of
grace
,
when
,
if
you
voluntarily
renew
your
oaths
to
him
,
he
will
accept
them
,
and
place
me
at
your
disposal
once
more
;
but
if
you
still
continue
obstinate--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
abandon
me
,
"
interrupted
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
I
knew
it
.
<EOS>
Fool
that
I
was
to
trust
one
who
,
from
the
beginning
,
has
been
a
deceiver
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
short
memory
,
and
but
little
gratitude
,
madam
and
seem
entirely
to
forget
the
important
favour
conferred
upon
you
last
night
.
<EOS>
At
your
solicitation
,
the
boundaries
of
your
property
were
changed
,
and
large
slips
of
land
filched
from
another
,
to
be
given
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
fail
in
your
duty
,
you
can
not
expect
this
to
continue
.
<EOS>
The
boundary
marks
will
be
set
up
in
their
old
places
,
and
the
land
restored
to
its
rightful
owner
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
expected
as
much
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
,
disdainfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thus
all
our
pains
will
be
thrown
away
,
"
pursued
the
familiar
;
"
and
though
you
may
make
light
of
the
labour
,
it
is
no
easy
task
to
change
the
face
of
a
whole
country
--
to
turn
streams
from
their
course
,
move
bogs
,
transplant
trees
,
and
shift
houses
,
all
of
which
has
been
done
,
and
will
now
have
to
be
undone
,
because
of
your
inconstancy
.
<EOS>
I
,
myself
,
have
been
obliged
to
act
as
many
parts
as
a
poor
player
to
please
you
,
and
now
you
dismiss
me
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
as
if
I
had
played
them
indifferently
,
whereas
the
most
fastidious
audience
would
have
been
ravished
with
my
performance
.
<EOS>
This
morning
I
was
the
reeve
of
the
forest
,
and
as
such
obliged
to
assume
the
shape
of
a
rascally
attorney
.
<EOS>
I
felt
it
a
degradation
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
I
better
pleased
when
you
compelled
me
to
put
on
the
likeness
of
old
Roger
Nowell
;
for
,
whatever
you
may
think
,
I
am
not
so
entirely
destitute
of
personal
vanity
as
to
prefer
either
of
their
figures
to
my
own
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
showed
no
disinclination
to
oblige
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
strangely
unreasonable
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Is
it
my
lord
's
fault
if
your
desire
of
vengeance
expires
in
its
fruition
--
if
,
when
you
have
accomplished
an
object
,
you
no
longer
care
for
it
?
<EOS>
You
ask
for
revenge
--
for
power
.
<EOS>
You
have
them
,
and
cast
them
aside
like
childish
baubles
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
lord
is
an
arch
deceiver
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
and
can
not
perform
his
promises
.
<EOS>
They
are
empty
delusions
--
profitless
,
unsubstantial
as
shadows
.
<EOS>
His
power
prevails
not
against
any
thing
holy
,
as
I
myself
have
just
now
experienced
.
<EOS>
His
money
turns
to
withered
leaves
;
his
treasures
are
dust
and
ashes
.
<EOS>
Strong
only
is
he
in
power
of
mischief
,
and
even
his
mischief
,
like
curses
,
recoils
on
those
who
use
it
.
<EOS>
His
vengeance
is
no
true
vengeance
,
for
it
troubles
the
conscience
,
and
engenders
remorse
;
whereas
the
servant
of
heaven
heaps
coals
of
fire
on
the
head
of
his
adversary
by
kindness
,
and
satisfies
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
thought
of
all
this
before
you
vowed
yourself
to
him
,
"
said
the
familiar
;
"
it
is
too
late
to
reflect
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perchance
not
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beware
!
"
thundered
the
demon
,
with
a
terrible
gesture
;
"
any
overt
act
of
disobedience
,
and
your
limbs
shall
be
scattered
over
this
chamber
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
not
dare
thee
to
it
,
it
is
not
because
I
fear
thee
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
in
no
way
dismayed
by
the
threat
.
"
<EOS>
Thou
canst
not
control
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
Thou
speakest
of
the
services
rendered
by
thy
lord
,
and
I
repeat
they
are
like
his
promises
,
naught
.
<EOS>
Show
me
the
witch
he
has
enriched
.
<EOS>
Of
what
profit
is
her
worship
of
the
false
deity
--
of
what
avail
the
sacrifices
she
makes
at
his
foul
altars
?
<EOS>
It
is
ever
the
same
spilling
of
blood
,
ever
the
same
working
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
The
wheels
Of
crime
roll
on
like
the
car
of
the
Indian
idol
,
crushing
all
before
them
.
<EOS>
Doth
thy
master
ever
help
his
servants
in
their
need
?
<EOS>
Doth
he
not
ever
abandon
them
when
they
are
no
longer
useful
,
and
can
win
him
no
more
proselytes
?
<EOS>
Miserable
servants
--
miserable
master
!
<EOS>
Look
at
the
murtherous
Demdike
and
the
malignant
Chattox
,
and
examine
the
means
whereby
they
have
prolonged
their
baleful
career
.
<EOS>
Enormities
of
all
kinds
committed
,
and
all
their
families
devoted
to
the
Fiend
--
all
wizards
or
witches
!
<EOS>
Look
at
them
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
What
profit
to
them
is
their
long
service
?
<EOS>
Are
they
rich
?
<EOS>
Are
they
in
possession
of
unfading
youth
and
beauty
?
<EOS>
Are
they
splendidly
lodged
?
<EOS>
Have
they
all
they
desire
?
<EOS>
No!--the
one
dwells
in
a
solitary
turret
,
and
the
other
in
a
wretched
hovel
;
and
both
are
miserable
creatures
,
living
only
on
the
dole
wrung
by
threats
from
terrified
peasants
,
and
capable
of
no
gratification
but
such
as
results
from
practices
of
malice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
nothing
?
"
asked
the
familiar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
them
it
is
every
thing
.
<EOS>
They
care
neither
for
splendid
mansions
,
nor
wealth
,
nor
youth
,
nor
beauty
.
<EOS>
If
they
did
,
they
could
have
them
all
.
<EOS>
They
care
only
for
the
dread
and
mysterious
power
they
possess
,
to
be
able
to
fascinate
with
a
glance
,
to
transfix
by
a
gesture
,
to
inflict
strange
ailments
by
a
word
,
and
to
kill
by
a
curse
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
privilege
they
seek
,
and
this
privilege
they
enjoy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
the
end
of
it
all
?
"
demanded
Mistress
Nutter
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Erelong
,
they
will
be
unable
to
furnish
victims
to
their
insatiate
master
,
who
will
then
abandon
them
.
<EOS>
Their
bodies
will
go
to
the
hangman
,
and
their
souls
to
endless
bale
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
familiar
laughed
as
if
a
good
joke
had
been
repeated
to
him
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
"
he
said
;
"
very
true
.
<EOS>
You
have
stated
the
case
exactly
,
madam
.
<EOS>
Such
will
certainly
be
the
course
of
events
.
<EOS>
But
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
The
old
hags
will
have
enjoyed
a
long
term
--
much
longer
than
might
have
been
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
,
however
,
as
I
have
intimated
,
will
extend
hers
,
and
it
is
fortunate
for
her
she
is
enabled
to
do
so
,
as
it
would
otherwise
expire
an
hour
after
midnight
,
and
could
not
be
renewed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
liest
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mistress
Nutter--"liest
like
thy
lord
,
who
is
the
father
of
lies
.
<EOS>
My
innocent
child
can
never
be
offered
up
at
his
impious
shrine
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
fear
for
her
.
<EOS>
Neither
he
,
nor
Mother
Demdike
,
nor
any
of
the
accursed
sisterhood
,
can
harm
her
.
<EOS>
Her
goodness
will
cover
her
like
armour
,
which
no
evil
can
penetrate
.
<EOS>
Let
him
wreak
his
vengeance
,
if
he
will
,
on
me
.
<EOS>
Let
him
treat
me
as
a
slave
who
has
cast
off
his
yoke
.
<EOS>
Let
him
abridge
the
scanty
time
allotted
me
,
and
bear
me
hence
to
his
burning
kingdom
;
but
injure
my
child
,
he
cannot
--
shall
not
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
to
Malkin
Tower
at
midnight
,
and
thou
wilt
see
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
familiar
,
with
a
mocking
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
there
,
but
it
shall
be
to
deliver
her
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
get
thee
gone
!
<EOS>
I
need
thee
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
not
deceived
,
proud
woman
,
"
said
the
familiar
.
<EOS>
"
Once
dismissed
,
I
may
not
be
recalled
,
while
thou
wilt
be
wholly
unable
to
defend
thyself
against
thy
enemies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
,
"
she
rejoined
;
"
begone
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
familiar
stepped
back
,
and
,
stamping
upon
the
hearthstone
,
it
sank
like
a
trapdoor
,
and
he
disappeared
beneath
it
,
a
flash
of
lightning
playing
round
his
dusky
figure
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
her
vaunted
resolution
,
and
the
boldness
with
which
she
had
comported
herself
before
the
familiar
,
Mistress
Nutter
now
completely
gave
way
,
and
for
awhile
abandoned
herself
to
despair
.
<EOS>
Aroused
at
length
by
the
absolute
necessity
of
action
,
she
again
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
forth
.
<EOS>
The
storm
still
raged
furiously
without
--
<EOS>
so
furiously
,
indeed
,
that
it
would
be
madness
to
brave
it
,
now
that
she
was
deprived
of
her
power
,
and
reduced
to
the
ordinary
level
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
Its
very
violence
,
however
,
assured
her
it
must
soon
cease
,
and
she
would
then
set
out
for
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
But
what
chance
had
she
now
in
a
struggle
with
the
old
hag
,
with
all
the
energies
of
hell
at
her
command?--what
hope
was
there
of
her
being
able
to
effect
her
daughter
's
liberation
?
<EOS>
No
matter
,
however
desperate
,
the
attempt
should
be
made
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
it
would
be
necessary
<EOS>
so
see
what
was
going
on
below
,
and
ascertain
whether
Blackadder
had
returned
with
Parson
Holden
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
she
descended
to
the
hall
,
where
she
found
Nicholas
Assheton
fast
asleep
in
a
great
arm
-
chair
,
and
rocked
rather
than
disturbed
by
the
loud
concussions
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
The
squire
was
,
no
doubt
,
overcome
by
the
fatigues
of
the
day
,
or
it
might
be
by
the
potency
of
the
wine
he
had
swallowed
,
for
an
empty
flask
stood
on
the
table
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
did
not
awaken
him
,
but
proceeded
to
the
chamber
where
she
had
left
Nowell
and
Potts
prisoners
,
both
of
whom
rose
on
her
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
seated
,
gentlemen
,
I
pray
you
,
"
she
said
,
courteously
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
see
if
you
need
any
thing
;
for
when
this
fearful
storm
abates
,
I
am
going
forth
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
madam
,
"
replied
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
myself
I
require
nothing
further
;
but
perhaps
another
bottle
of
wine
might
be
agreeable
to
my
honoured
and
singular
good
client
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
for
yourself
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Roger
Nowell
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
,
"
interposed
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
of
a
word
with
you
before
I
go
,
Master
Nowell
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
this
dispute
has
arisen
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
exclaimed
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
sorry
,
"
pursued
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
wish
to
make
every
reparation
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Reparation
,
madam
!
"
cried
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
Give
back
the
land
you
have
stolen
from
me
--
restore
the
boundary
lines
--
sign
the
deed
in
Sir
Ralph
's
possession
--
that
is
the
only
reparation
you
can
make
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
!
"
exclaimed
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
Then
the
fellow
did
not
deceive
us
,
Master
Potts
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
any
one
been
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
lady
,
uneasily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
the
reeve
of
the
forest
,
"
replied
Nowell
.
"
<EOS>
He
told
us
you
would
be
with
us
presently
,
and
would
make
fair
offers
to
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
told
us
also
_
why
_
you
would
make
them
,
madam
,
"
added
Potts
,
in
an
insolent
and
menacing
tone
;
"
he
told
us
you
would
make
a
merit
of
doing
what
you
could
not
help
--
that
your
power
had
gone
from
you
--
that
your
works
of
darkness
would
be
destroyed
--
and
that
,
in
a
word
,
you
were
abandoned
by
the
devil
,
your
master
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
deceived
you
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
you
the
offer
out
of
pure
good
-
will
,
and
you
can
reject
it
or
not
,
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
All
I
stipulate
,
if
you
do
accept
it
,
is
,
that
you
pledge
me
your
word
not
to
bring
any
charge
of
witchcraft
against
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
give
the
pledge
,
"
whispered
a
voice
in
the
ear
of
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
speak
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
turning
to
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
attorney
,
in
a
low
tone
;
"
but
I
thought
you
cautioned
me
against--
<EOS>
"
 
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Nowell
;
"
it
must
be
the
reeve
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
comply
with
your
request
,
madam
,
"
he
added
,
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
said
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
make
no
bargain
with
an
avowed
witch
.
<EOS>
We
should
gain
nothing
by
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
we
should
be
losers
,
for
we
have
the
positive
assurance
of
a
gentleman
whom
we
believe
to
be
upon
terms
of
intimacy
with
a
certain
black
gentleman
of
your
acquaintance
,
madam
,
that
the
latter
has
given
you
up
entirely
,
and
that
law
and
justice
may
,
therefore
,
take
their
course
.
<EOS>
We
protest
against
our
unlawful
detention
;
but
we
give
ourselves
small
concern
about
it
,
as
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
who
will
be
advised
of
our
situation
by
Parson
Holden
,
will
speedily
come
to
our
liberation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
are
now
quite
easy
on
that
score
,
madam
,
"
added
Nowell
;
"
and
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
we
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
escorting
you
to
Lancaster
Castle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
your
trial
will
come
on
at
the
next
assizes
,
about
the
middle
of
August
,
"
said
Potts
,
"
You
have
only
four
months
to
run
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
indeed
my
term
,
"
muttered
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
tarry
to
listen
to
your
taunts
,
"
she
added
,
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
possibly
regret
rejecting
my
proposal
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
quitted
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
returned
to
the
hall
,
Nicholas
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
devil
of
a
storm
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
stretching
himself
and
rubbing
his
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
Zounds
!
<EOS>
that
flash
of
lightning
was
enough
to
blind
me
,
and
the
thunder
wellnigh
splits
one
's
ears
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
you
have
slept
through
louder
peals
,
Nicholas
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
coming
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
Richard
has
not
returned
from
his
mission
,
and
I
must
go
myself
to
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
In
my
absence
,
I
must
entrust
you
with
the
defence
of
my
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
willing
to
undertake
it
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
provided
no
witchcraft
be
used
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
you
need
not
fear
that
,
"
said
the
lady
,
with
a
forced
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
leave
it
to
me
,
"
said
the
squire
;
"
but
you
will
not
set
out
till
the
storm
is
over
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
there
seems
no
likelihood
of
its
cessation
,
and
each
moment
is
fraught
with
peril
to
Alizon
.
<EOS>
If
aught
happens
to
me
,
Nicholas
--
if
I
should
--
whatever
mischance
may
befall
me
--
promise
me
you
will
stand
by
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
squire
gave
the
required
promise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
I
hold
you
to
your
word
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
Take
this
parchment
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
deed
of
gift
,
assigning
this
mansion
and
all
my
estates
to
her
.
<EOS>
Under
certain
circumstances
you
will
produce
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
circumstances
?
<EOS>
I
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
you
,
madam
,
"
said
the
squire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
question
me
further
,
but
take
especial
care
of
the
deed
,
and
produce
it
,
as
I
have
said
,
at
the
fitting
moment
.
<EOS>
You
will
know
when
that
arrives
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
I
am
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
latter
exclamation
had
been
occasioned
by
the
appearance
of
an
old
woman
at
the
further
end
of
the
hall
,
beckoning
to
her
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
her
,
Mistress
Nutter
immediately
quitted
the
squire
,
and
followed
her
into
a
small
chamber
opening
from
this
part
of
the
hall
,
and
into
which
she
retreated
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
brings
you
here
,
Mother
Chattox
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
lady
,
closing
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
not
guess
?
"
replied
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
help
you
,
not
for
any
love
I
bear
you
,
but
to
avenge
myself
on
old
Demdike
.
<EOS>
Do
not
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
My
familiar
,
Fancy
,
has
told
me
all
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
you
are
circumstanced
.
<EOS>
I
know
Alizon
is
in
old
Demdike
's
clutches
,
and
you
are
unable
to
extricate
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
,
and
will
;
because
if
the
hateful
old
hag
fails
in
offering
up
her
sacrifice
before
the
first
hour
of
day
,
her
term
will
be
out
,
and
I
shall
be
rid
of
her
,
and
reign
in
her
stead
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
she
will
be
on
her
way
to
Lancaster
Castle
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
The
dungeon
is
prepared
for
her
--
the
stake
driven
into
the
ground
--
the
fagots
heaped
around
it
.
<EOS>
The
torch
has
only
to
be
lighted
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
Ho
!

THE

<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
to
Malkin
Tower
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mistress
Nutter
,
shuddering
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
to
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Chattox
;
"
for
there
the
girl
will
be
taken
,
and
there
only
can
we
secure
her
.
<EOS>
But
first
we
must
proceed
to
my
hut
,
and
make
some
preparations
.
<EOS>
I
have
three
scalps
and
eight
teeth
,
taken
from
a
grave
in
<EOS>
Goldshaw
churchyard
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
We
can
make
a
charm
with
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
prepare
it
alone
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
I
can
have
nought
to
do
with
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
--
true
--
I
had
forgotten
,
"
cried
the
hag
,
with
a
chuckling
<EOS>
laugh--"you
are
no
longer
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
I
will
do
it
alone
.
<EOS>
But
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
object
to
mount
upon
my
broomstick
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
only
safe
conveyance
in
this
storm
of
the
devil
's
raising
.
<EOS>
Come
--
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
threw
open
the
window
and
sprang
forth
,
followed
by
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
murky
air
,
and
borne
as
if
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
,
two
dark
forms
are
flying
swiftly
.
<EOS>
Over
the
tops
of
the
tempest
-
shaken
trees
they
go
,
and
as
they
gain
the
skirts
of
the
thicket
an
oak
beneath
is
shivered
by
a
thunderbolt
.
<EOS>
They
hear
the
fearful
crash
,
and
see
the
splinters
fly
far
and
wide
;
and
the
foremost
of
the
two
,
who
,
with
her
skinny
arm
extended
,
seems
to
direct
their
course
,
utters
a
wild
scream
of
laughter
,
while
a
raven
,
speeding
on
broad
black
wing
before
them
,
croaks
hoarsely
.
<EOS>
Now
the
torrent
rages
below
,
and
they
see
its
white
waters
tumbling
over
a
ledge
of
rock
;
now
they
pass
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
;
now
skim
over
a
dreary
waste
and
dangerous
morass
.
<EOS>
Fearful
it
is
to
behold
those
two
flying
figures
,
as
the
lightning
shows
them
,
bestriding
their
fantastical
steed
;
the
one
an
old
hag
with
hideous
lineaments
and
distorted
person
,
and
the
other
a
proud
dame
,
still
beautiful
,
though
no
longer
young
,
pale
as
death
,
and
her
loose
jetty
hair
streaming
like
a
meteor
in
the
breeze
.
 
<EOS>
The
ride
is
over
,
and
they
alight
near
the
door
of
a
solitary
hovel
.
<EOS>
The
raven
has
preceded
them
,
and
,
perched
on
the
chimney
top
,
flies
down
it
as
they
enter
,
and
greets
them
with
hoarse
croaking
.
<EOS>
The
inside
of
the
hut
corresponds
with
its
miserable
exterior
,
consisting
only
of
two
rooms
,
in
one
of
which
is
a
wretched
pallet
;
in
the
other
are
a
couple
of
large
chests
,
a
crazy
table
,
a
bench
,
a
three
-
legged
stool
,
and
a
spinning
-
wheel
.
<EOS>
A
caldron
is
suspended
above
a
peat
fire
,
smouldering
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
There
is
only
one
window
,
and
a
thick
curtain
is
drawn
across
it
,
to
secure
the
inmate
of
the
hut
from
prying
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
Chattox
closes
and
bars
the
door
,
and
,
motioning
Mistress
Nutter
to
seat
herself
upon
the
stool
,
kneels
down
near
the
hearth
,
and
blows
the
turf
into
a
flame
,
the
raven
helping
her
,
by
flapping
his
big
black
wings
,
and
uttering
a
variety
of
strange
sounds
,
as
the
sparks
fly
about
.
<EOS>
Heaping
on
more
turf
,
and
shifting
the
caldron
,
so
that
it
may
receive
the
full
influence
of
the
flame
,
the
hag
proceeds
to
one
of
the
chests
,
and
takes
out
sundry
small
matters
,
which
she
places
one
by
one
with
great
care
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
raven
has
now
fixed
his
great
talons
on
her
shoulder
,
and
chuckles
and
croaks
in
her
ear
as
she
pursues
her
occupation
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
piece
of
bone
attracts
his
attention
,
and
darting
out
his
beak
,
he
seizes
it
,
and
hops
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
that
scalp
,
thou
mischievous
imp
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
hag
,
"
<EOS>
I
need
it
for
the
charm
I
am
about
to
prepare
.
<EOS>
Give
it
me
,
I
say
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
raven
still
held
it
fast
,
and
hopped
here
and
there
so
nimbly
that
she
was
unable
to
catch
him
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
he
had
exhausted
her
patience
,
he
alighted
on
Mistress
Nutter
's
shoulder
,
and
dropped
it
into
her
lap
.
<EOS>
Engrossed
by
her
own
painful
thoughts
,
the
lady
had
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
passing
,
and
she
shuddered
as
she
took
up
the
fragment
of
mortality
,
and
placed
it
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
A
few
tufts
of
hair
,
the
texture
of
which
showed
they
had
belonged
to
a
female
,
still
adhered
to
the
scalp
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
regarded
it
fixedly
,
and
with
an
interest
for
which
she
could
not
account
.
 
<EOS>
After
sharply
chiding
the
raven
,
Mother
Chattox
put
forth
her
hand
to
grasp
the
prize
she
had
been
robbed
of
,
when
Mistress
Nutter
checked
her
by
observing
,
"
You
said
you
got
this
scalp
from
Goldshaw
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Know
<EOS>
you
ought
concerning
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
a
good
deal
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
,
chuckling
.
<EOS>
"
It
comes
from
a
grave
near
the
yew
-
tree
,
and
not
far
from
Abbot
Cliderhow
's
cross
.
<EOS>
Old
Zachariah
Worms
,
the
sexton
,
digged
it
up
for
me
.
<EOS>
That
yellow
skull
had
once
a
fair
face
attached
to
it
,
and
those
few
dull
tufts
were
once
bright
flowing
tresses
.
<EOS>
She
who
owned
them
died
young
;
but
,
young
as
she
was
,
she
survived
all
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
Hollow
cheeks
and
hollow
eyes
,
wasted
flesh
,
and
cruel
cough
,
were
hers
--
and
she
pined
and
pined
away
.
<EOS>
Folks
said
she
was
forespoken
,
and
that
I
had
done
it
.
<EOS>
I
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
She
had
never
done
me
harm
.
<EOS>
You
know
whether
I
was
rightly
accused
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Take
it
away
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
hurriedly
,
and
as
if
struggling
against
some
overmastering
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
to
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
not
this
horrible
reminder
of
my
crimes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
was
the
reason
,
then
,
why
Ralph
stole
the
scalp
from
me
,
"
muttered
the
hag
,
as
she
threw
it
,
together
with
some
other
matters
,
into
the
caldron
.
"
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
show
you
his
sagacity
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
guessed
as
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
into
the
other
room
while
you
make
your
preparations
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
rising
;
"
the
sight
of
them
disturbs
me
.
<EOS>
You
can
summon
me
when
you
are
ready
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
old
hag
,
"
and
you
must
control
your
impatience
,
for
the
spell
requires
time
for
its
confection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
made
no
reply
,
but
,
walking
into
the
inner
room
,
closed
the
door
,
and
threw
herself
upon
the
pallet
.
<EOS>
Here
,
despite
her
anxiety
,
sleep
stole
upon
her
,
and
though
her
dreams
were
troubled
,
she
did
not
awake
till
Mother
Chattox
stood
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
slept
long
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
More
than
three
hours
,
"
replied
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Three
hours
!
"
exclaimed
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
wake
me
before
?
<EOS>
You
would
have
saved
me
from
terrible
dreams
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
too
late
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
Mother
Chattox
;
"
there
is
plenty
of
time
.
<EOS>
Come
into
the
other
room
.
<EOS>
All
is
ready
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Mistress
Nutter
followed
the
old
hag
into
the
adjoining
room
,
a
strong
odour
,
arising
from
a
chafing
-
dish
,
in
which
herbs
,
roots
,
and
other
ingredients
were
burning
,
assailed
her
,
and
,
versed
in
all
weird
ceremonials
,
she
knew
that
a
powerful
suffumigation
had
been
made
,
though
with
what
intent
she
had
yet
to
learn
.
<EOS>
The
scanty
furniture
had
been
cleared
away
,
and
a
circle
was
described
on
the
clay
floor
by
skulls
and
bones
,
alternated
by
dried
toads
,
adders
,
and
other
reptiles
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
magical
circle
,
the
caldron
,
which
had
been
brought
from
the
chimney
,
was
placed
,
and
,
the
lid
being
removed
,
a
thick
vapour
arose
from
it
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
looked
around
for
the
raven
,
but
the
bird
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
,
nor
did
any
other
living
thing
appear
to
be
present
beside
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
the
lady
's
hand
,
Mother
Chattox
drew
her
into
the
circle
,
and
began
to
mutter
a
spell
;
after
which
,
still
maintaining
her
hold
of
her
companion
,
she
bade
her
look
into
the
caldron
,
and
declare
what
she
saw
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
nothing
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
after
she
had
gazed
upon
the
bubbling
waters
for
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
yes
--
<EOS>
I
discern
certain
figures
,
but
they
are
confused
by
the
steam
,
and
broken
by
the
agitation
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Caldron
--
cease
boiling
!
<EOS>
and
smoke
--
disperse
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mother
Chattox
,
stamping
her
foot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
can
you
see
more
plainly
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
I
behold
the
subterranean
chamber
beneath
Malkin
Tower
,
with
its
nine
ponderous
columns
,
its
altar
in
the
midst
of
them
,
its
demon
image
,
and
the
well
with
waters
black
as
Lethe
beside
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
water
within
the
caldron
came
from
that
well
,
"
said
Mother
Chattox
,
with
a
chuckling
laugh
;
"
my
familiar
risked
his
liberty
to
bring
it
,
but
he
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
My
precious
Fancy
,
thou
art
the
best
of
servants
,
and
shalt
have
my
best
blood
to
reward
thee
to
-
morrow
--
thou
shalt
,
my
sweetheart
,
my
chuck
,
my
dandyprat
.
<EOS>
But
hie
thee
back
to
Malkin
Tower
,
and
contrive
that
this
lady
may
hear
,
as
well
as
see
,
all
that
passes
.
<EOS>
Away
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
concluded
that
the
injunction
would
be
obeyed
;
but
,
as
the
familiar
was
invisible
to
her
,
she
could
not
detect
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
no
one
within
the
dungeon
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
yes
,
"
exclaimed
the
lady
;
"
I
have
at
last
discovered
Alizon
.
<EOS>
She
was
behind
one
of
the
pillars
.
<EOS>
A
little
girl
is
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
Jennet
Device
,
and
,
from
the
spiteful
looks
of
the
latter
,
I
judge
she
is
mocking
her
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
malice
lurks
in
the
breast
of
that
hateful
child
!
<EOS>
She
is
a
true
descendant
of
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
But
Alizon
--
sweet
,
patient
Alizon
--
she
seems
to
bear
all
her
taunts
with
a
meekness
and
resignation
enough
to
move
the
hardest
heart
.
<EOS>
I
would
weep
for
her
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
And
now
Jennet
shakes
her
hand
at
her
,
and
leaves
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
alone
.
<EOS>
What
will
she
do
now
?
<EOS>
Has
she
<EOS>
no
thoughts
of
escape
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
She
looks
about
her
distractedly
--
<EOS>
runs
round
the
vault
--
tries
the
door
of
every
cell
:
they
are
all
bolted
and
barred
<EOS>
--
there
is
no
outlet
--
none
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
next
?
"
inquired
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
shrieks
aloud
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
the
cry
thrills
through
every
fibre
in
my
frame
.
<EOS>
She
calls
upon
me
for
aid
--
upon
me
,
her
mother
,
and
little
thinks
I
hear
her
,
and
am
unable
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
is
horrible
.
<EOS>
Take
me
to
her
,
good
Chattox
--
take
me
to
her
,
I
implore
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
replied
the
hag
:
<EOS>
"
you
must
await
the
fitting
time
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
not
control
yourself
,
I
shall
remove
the
caldron
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
,
no
,
"
cried
the
distracted
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
calm
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
I
see
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
belying
her
former
words
by
sudden
vehemence
,
while
rage
and
astonishment
were
depicted
upon
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
What
infernal
delusion
is
practised
upon
my
child
!
<EOS>
This
is
monstrous--
intolerable
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
could
undeceive
her
--
could
warn
her
of
the
snare
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
nature
of
the
delusion
?
"
asked
Mother
Chattox
,
with
some
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
blind
I
can
not
see
the
figures
on
the
water
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
evil
spirit
in
my
likeness
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
your
likeness
!
"
exclaimed
the
hag
.
"
<EOS>
A
cunning
device
--
and
worthy
of
old
Demdike
--
ho
!
ho
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
scarce
bear
to
look
on
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
but
I
must
,
though
it
tears
my
heart
in
pieces
to
witness
such
cruelty
.
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
has
rushed
to
her
false
parent
--
has
thrown
her
arms
around
her
,
and
is
weeping
on
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
is
a
maddening
sight
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
nothing
to
what
follows
.
<EOS>
The
temptress
,
with
the
subtlety
of
the
old
serpent
,
is
pouring
lies
into
her
ear
,
telling
her
they
both
are
captives
,
and
both
will
perish
unless
she
consents
to
purchase
their
deliverance
at
the
price
of
her
soul
,
and
she
offers
her
a
bond
to
sign
--
such
a
bond
as
,
alas
!
<EOS>
thou
and
I
,
Chattox
,
have
signed
.
<EOS>
But
Alizon
rejects
it
with
horror
,
and
gazes
at
her
false
mother
as
if
she
suspected
the
delusion
.
<EOS>
But
the
temptress
is
not
to
be
beaten
thus
.
<EOS>
She
renews
her
entreaties
,
casts
herself
on
the
ground
,
and
clasps
my
child
's
knees
in
humblest
supplication
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
Alizon
would
place
her
foot
upon
her
neck
and
crush
her
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
so
the
good
act
.
<EOS>
She
raises
her
,
and
tells
her
she
will
willingly
die
for
her
;
but
her
soul
was
given
to
her
by
her
Creator
,
and
must
be
returned
to
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
had
thought
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
answer
makes
the
spirit
?
"
asked
the
witch
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
laughs
derisively
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
and
proceeds
to
use
all
those
sophistical
arguments
,
which
we
have
so
often
heard
,
to
pervert
her
mind
,
and
overthrow
her
principles
.
<EOS>
But
Alizon
is
proof
against
them
all
.
<EOS>
Religion
and
virtue
support
her
,
and
make
her
more
than
a
match
for
her
opponent
.
<EOS>
Equally
vain
are
the
spirit
's
attempts
to
seduce
her
by
the
offer
of
a
life
of
sinful
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
She
rejects
it
with
angry
scorn
.
<EOS>
Failing
in
argument
and
entreaty
,
the
spirit
now
endeavours
to
work
upon
her
fears
,
and
paints
,
in
appalling
colours
,
the
tortures
she
will
have
to
endure
,
contrasting
them
with
the
delight
she
is
voluntarily
abandoning
,
with
the
lover
she
might
espouse
,
with
the
high
worldly
position
she
might
fill
.
'
<EOS>
What
are
worldly
joys
and
honours
compared
with
those
of
heaven
!
'
<EOS>
exclaims
Alizon
;
'
I
would
not
exchange
them
.
'
<EOS>
The
spirit
then
,
in
a
vision
,
shows
her
her
lover
,
Richard
,
and
asks
her
if
she
can
resist
his
entreaties
.
<EOS>
The
trial
is
very
sore
,
as
she
gazes
on
that
beloved
form
,
seeming
,
by
its
passionate
gestures
,
to
implore
her
to
assent
,
but
she
is
firm
,
and
the
vision
disappears
.
<EOS>
The
ordeal
is
now
over
.
<EOS>
Alizon
has
triumphed
over
all
their
arts
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
in
my
likeness
resumes
its
fiendish
shape
,
and
,
with
a
dreadful
menace
against
the
poor
girl
,
vanishes
from
her
sight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
Demdike
has
not
done
with
her
yet
,
"
observed
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
old
hag
descends
the
staircase
leading
to
the
vault
,
and
approaches
the
miserable
captive
.
<EOS>
With
her
there
are
no
supplications
--
no
arguments
;
but
commands
and
terrible
threats
.
<EOS>
She
is
as
unsuccessful
as
her
envoy
.
<EOS>
Alizon
has
gained
courage
and
defies
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
does
she
so
?
"
exclaimed
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
solid
floor
resounds
with
the
stamping
of
the
enraged
witch
,
"
pursued
Mistress
Nutter
.
"
<EOS>
She
tells
Alizon
she
will
take
her
to
Pendle
Hill
at
midnight
,
and
there
offer
her
up
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
Fiend
.
<EOS>
My
child
replies
that
she
trusts
for
her
deliverance
to
Heaven
--
that
her
body
may
be
destroyed
--
that
her
soul
can
not
be
harmed
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
are
the
words
uttered
than
a
terrible
clangour
is
heard
.
<EOS>
The
walls
of
the
dungeon
seem
breaking
down
,
and
the
ponderous
columns
reel
.
<EOS>
The
demon
statue
rises
on
its
throne
,
and
a
stream
of
flame
issues
from
its
brow
.
<EOS>
The
doors
of
the
cells
burst
open
,
and
with
the
clanking
of
chains
,
and
other
dismal
noises
,
skeleton
shapes
stalk
forth
,
from
them
,
each
with
a
pale
blue
light
above
its
head
.
<EOS>
Monstrous
beasts
,
like
tiger
-
cats
,
with
rough
black
skins
and
flaming
eyes
,
are
moving
about
,
and
looking
as
if
they
would
spring
upon
the
captive
.
<EOS>
Two
gravestones
are
now
pushed
aside
,
and
from
the
cold
earth
arise
the
forms
of
Blackburn
,
the
robber
,
and
his
paramour
,
the
dissolute
Isole
de
Heton
.
<EOS>
She
joins
the
grisly
throng
now
approaching
the
distracted
girl
,
who
falls
insensible
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
see
aught
more
?
"
asked
the
hag
,
as
Mistress
Nutter
still
bent
eagerly
over
the
caldron
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
the
whole
chamber
is
buried
in
darkness
,
"
replied
the
lady
;
"
I
can
see
nothing
of
my
poor
child
.
<EOS>
What
will
become
of
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
question
Fancy
,
"
replied
the
hag
,
throwing
some
fresh
ingredients
into
the
chafing
-
dish
;
and
,
as
the
smoke
arose
,
she
vociferated
,
"
Come
hither
,
Fancy
<EOS>
;
I
want
thee
,
my
fondling
,
my
sweet
.
<EOS>
Come
quickly
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
thou
art
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
familiar
was
still
invisible
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
but
a
slight
sound
made
her
aware
of
his
presence
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
my
sweet
Fancy
,
"
pursued
the
hag
,
"
tell
us
,
if
thou
canst
,
what
will
be
done
with
Alizon
,
and
what
course
we
must
pursue
to
free
her
from
old
Demdike
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
present
she
is
in
a
state
of
insensibility
,
"
replied
a
harsh
voice
,
"
and
she
will
be
kept
in
that
condition
till
she
is
conveyed
to
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
told
you
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
take
her
from
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
well
guarded
.
<EOS>
Your
only
chance
will
be
to
interrupt
the
sacrifice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how
,
my
sweet
Fancy
?
<EOS>
how
,
my
little
darling
?
"
inquired
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
perplexing
question
,
"
replied
the
voice
;
"
for
,
by
showing
you
how
to
obtain
possession
of
the
girl
,
I
disobey
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
you
serve
me
--
<EOS>
you
please
me
,
<EOS>
my
pretty
Fancy
,
"
cried
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
quaff
your
fill
of
blood
on
the
morrow
,
if
you
do
this
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
get
rid
of
my
old
enemy
--
to
catch
her
in
her
own
toils
--
to
send
her
to
a
dungeon
--
to
burn
her
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
You
must
help
me
,
my
little
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
all
I
can
,
"
replied
the
voice
;
"
but
Mother
Demdike
is
cunning
and
powerful
,
and
high
in
favour
with
my
lord
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
mortal
aid
as
well
as
mine
.
<EOS>
The
officers
of
justice
must
be
there
to
seize
her
at
the
moment
when
the
victim
is
snatched
from
her
,
or
she
will
baffle
all
your
schemes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
shall
we
accomplish
this
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
to
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
put
on
the
form
of
Richard
Assheton
,
and
in
that
guise
hasten
to
Rough
Lee
,
where
he
will
find
the
young
man
's
cousin
,
Nicholas
,
to
whom
he
must
make
known
the
dreadful
deed
about
to
be
enacted
on
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
will
at
once
engage
to
interrupt
it
.
<EOS>
He
can
arm
himself
with
the
weapons
of
justice
by
taking
with
him
Roger
Nowell
,
the
magistrate
,
and
his
myrmidon
,
Potts
,
the
attorney
,
both
of
whom
are
detained
prisoners
in
the
house
by
my
orders
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
scheme
promises
well
,
and
shall
be
adopted
,
"
replied
the
hag
;
"
but
suppose
Richard
himself
should
appear
first
on
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Dost
know
where
he
is
,
my
sweet
Fancy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
last
saw
him
,
"
replied
the
voice
,
"
he
was
lying
senseless
on
the
ground
,
at
the
foot
of
Malkin
Tower
,
having
been
precipitated
from
the
doorway
by
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
You
need
apprehend
no
interference
from
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
,
"
replied
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
Then
take
his
form
,
my
pet
,
though
it
is
not
half
as
handsome
as
thy
own
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
black
skin
and
goat
-
like
limbs
are
to
thy
taste
<EOS>
,
I
know
,
"
replied
the
familiar
,
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
look
upon
him
before
he
goes
,
that
I
may
be
sure
the
likeness
is
exact
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
hearest
,
Fancy
!
<EOS>
Become
visible
to
her
,
"
cried
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
,
a
figure
in
all
respects
resembling
Richard
stood
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
think
you
of
him
?
<EOS>
Will
he
do
?
"
said
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
the
lady
;
"
and
now
send
him
off
at
once
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
time
to
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
there
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
"
said
the
familiar
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
own
I
like
not
the
task
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
help
for
it
,
my
sweet
Fancy
,
"
cried
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
forego
my
triumph
over
old
Demdike
.
<EOS>
Now
,
away
with
thee
,
and
when
thou
hast
executed
thy
mission
,
return
and
tell
us
how
thou
hast
sped
in
the
matter
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
familiar
promised
obedience
to
her
commands
,
and
disappeared
.

CHAPTER
XIV.--HOW
ROUGH
LEE
WAS
AGAIN
BESIEGED
.
  
<EOS>
Parson
Holden
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
left
Rough
Lee
,
charged
by
Potts
with
a
message
to
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
informing
him
of
his
detention
and
that
of
Roger
Nowell
,
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
imploring
him
to
come
to
their
assistance
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Congratulating
himself
on
his
escape
,
but
apprehensive
of
pursuit
,
the
worthy
rector
,
who
,
as
a
keen
huntsman
,
was
extremely
well
mounted
,
made
the
best
of
his
way
,
and
had
already
passed
the
gloomy
gorge
through
which
Pendle
Water
swept
,
had
climbed
the
hill
beyond
it
,
and
was
crossing
the
moor
now
alone
lying
between
him
and
Goldshaw
,
when
he
heard
a
shout
behind
him
,
and
,
turning
at
the
sound
,
beheld
Blackadder
and
another
mounted
serving
-
man
issuing
from
a
thicket
,
and
spurring
furiously
after
him
.
<EOS>
Relying
upon
the
speed
of
his
horse
,
he
disregarded
their
cries
,
and
accelerated
his
pace
;
but
,
in
spite
of
this
,
his
pursuers
gained
upon
him
rapidly
.
 
<EOS>
While
debating
the
question
of
resistance
or
surrender
,
the
rector
descried
Bess
Whitaker
coming
towards
him
from
the
opposite
direction
--
a
circumstance
that
greatly
rejoiced
him
;
for
,
aware
of
her
strength
and
courage
,
he
felt
sure
he
could
place
as
much
dependence
upon
her
in
this
emergency
as
on
any
man
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
Bess
was
riding
a
stout
,
rough
-
looking
nag
,
apparently
well
able
to
sustain
her
weight
,
and
carried
the
redoubtable
horsewhip
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
Holden
had
been
recognised
by
Bess
,
who
came
up
just
as
he
was
overtaken
and
seized
by
his
assailants
,
one
of
whom
caught
hold
of
his
cassock
,
and
tore
it
from
his
back
,
while
the
other
,
seizing
hold
of
his
bridle
,
endeavoured
,
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
the
contrary
,
to
turn
his
horse
round
.
<EOS>
Many
oaths
,
threats
,
and
blows
were
exchanged
during
the
scuffle
,
which
no
doubt
would
have
terminated
in
the
rector
's
defeat
,
and
his
compulsory
return
to
Rough
Lee
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
opportune
arrival
of
Bess
,
who
,
swearing
as
lustily
as
the
serving
-
men
,
and
brandishing
the
horsewhip
,
dashed
into
the
scene
of
action
,
and
,
with
a
few
well
-
applied
cuts
,
liberated
the
divine
.
<EOS>
Enraged
at
her
interference
,
and
smarting
from
the
application
of
the
whip
,
Blackadder
drew
a
petronel
from
his
girdle
,
and
levelled
it
at
her
head
;
but
,
ere
he
could
discharge
it
,
the
weapon
was
stricken
from
his
grasp
,
and
a
second
blow
on
the
head
from
the
but
-
end
of
the
whip
felled
him
from
his
horse
.
<EOS>
Seeing
the
fate
of
his
companion
,
the
other
serving
-
man
fled
,
leaving
Bess
mistress
of
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
The
rector
thanked
her
heartily
for
the
service
she
had
rendered
him
,
and
complimented
her
on
her
prowess
.
 
<EOS>
"

with

modesty
.

and
carry

replied
Holden
.
<EOS>
"
They
wished

"
 
<EOS>
"
A
most
praiseworthy
resolution
,
Bess
,
"
said
the
rector
;
"
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
this
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
pointing
to
Blackadder
,
who
,
though
badly
hurt
,
was
trying
to
creep
towards
the
petronel
,
which
was
lying
at
a
little
distance
from
him
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Perceiving
his
intention
,
Bess
quickly
dismounted
,
and
possessing
herself
of
the
weapon
,
stepped
aside
,
and
slipping
off
one
of
the
bands
that
confined
the
hose
on
her
well
-
shaped
leg
,
grasped
the
wounded
man
by
the
shoulders
,
and
with
great
expedition
tied
his
hands
behind
his
back
.
<EOS>
She
then
lifted
him
up
with
as
much
ease
as
if
he
had
been
an
infant
,
and
set
him
upon
his
horse
,
with
his
face
towards
the
tail
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
gave
the
bridle
to
the
rector
,
and
handing
him
the
petronel
at
the
same
time
,
told
him
to
take
care
of
his
prisoner
,
for
she
must
pursue
her
journey
.
<EOS>
And
with
this
,
in
spite
of
his
renewed
entreaties
that
she
would
go
back
with
him
,
she
sprang
on
her
horse
and
rode
off
.
 
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
Goldshaw
with
his
prisoner
,
the
rector
at
once
proceeded
to
the
hostel
,
in
front
of
which
<EOS>
he
found
several
of
the
villagers
assembled
,
attracted
by
the
numerous
company
within
doors
,
whose
shouts
and
laughter
could
be
heard
at
a
considerable
distance
.
<EOS>
Holden
's
appearance
with
Blackadder
occasioned
considerable
surprise
,
and
all
eagerly
gathered
round
him
to
learn
what
had
occurred
;
but
,
without
satisfying
their
curiosity
,
beyond
telling
them
he
had
been
attacked
by
the
prisoner
,
he
left
him
in
their
custody
and
entered
the
house
,
where
he
found
all
the
benches
in
the
principal
room
occupied
by
a
crew
of
half
-
drunken
roysterers
,
with
flagons
of
ale
before
them
;
for
,
after
Bess
's
departure
with
the
key
,
they
had
broken
into
the
cellar
,
and
,
broaching
a
cask
,
helped
themselves
to
its
contents
.
<EOS>
Various
weapons
were
scattered
about
the
tables
or
reared
against
the
walls
,
and
the
whole
scene
looked
like
a
carouse
by
a
band
of
marauders
.
<EOS>
Little
respect
was
shown
the
rector
,
and
he
was
saluted
by
many
a
ribald
jest
as
he
pushed
his
way
towards
the
inner
room
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
was
drinking
with
a
couple
of
desperadoes
,
whose
long
rapiers
and
tarnished
military
equipments
seemed
to
announce
that
they
had
,
at
some
time
or
other
,
belonged
to
the
army
,
though
their
ruffianly
looks
and
braggadocio
air
and
discourse
,
strongly
seasoned
with
oaths
and
slang
,
made
it
evident
that
they
were
now
little
better
than
Alsatian
bullies
.
<EOS>
They
had
,
in
fact
,
been
hired
by
Sir
Thomas
for
the
expedition
on
which
he
was
bent
,
as
he
could
find
no
one
in
the
country
upon
whom
he
could
so
well
count
as
on
them
.
<EOS>
Eyeing
the
rector
fiercely
,
as
he
intruded
upon
their
privacy
,
they
glanced
at
their
leader
to
ask
whether
they
should
turn
him
out
;
but
,
receiving
no
encouragement
for
such
rudeness
,
they
contented
themselves
with
scowling
at
him
from
beneath
their
bent
brows
,
twisting
up
their
shaggy
mustaches
,
and
trifling
with
the
hilts
of
their
rapiers
.
<EOS>
Holden
opened
his
business
at
once
;
and
as
soon
as
Sir
Thomas
heard
it
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
,
swearing
a
great
oath
,
declared
he
would
storm
Rough
Lee
,
and
burn
it
to
the
ground
,
if
Mistress
Nutter
did
not
set
the
two
captives
free
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
to
the
audacious
witch
herself
,
I
will
carry
her
off
,
in
spite
of
the
devil
,
her
master
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
Captain
Gauntlet
--
and
you
too
,
Captain
Storks
,
is
not
this
an
expedition
to
your
tastes
--
ha
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
two
worthies
appealed
to
responded
joyously
,
that
it
was
so
;
and
it
was
then
agreed
that
Blackadder
should
be
brought
in
and
interrogated
,
as
some
important
information
might
be
obtained
from
him
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Captain
Gauntlet
left
the
room
to
fetch
him
,
and
presently
afterwards
returned
dragging
in
the
prisoner
,
who
looked
dogged
and
angry
,
by
the
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
Harkye
,
fellow
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
,
sternly
,
"
if
you
do
not
answer
the
questions
I
shall
put
to
you
,
truly
and
satisfactorily
<EOS>
,
I
will
have
you
taken
out
into
the
yard
,
and
shot
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
Thus
much
premised
,
I
shall
proceed
with
my
examination
.
<EOS>
Master
Roger
Nowell
and
Master
Thomas
Potts
<EOS>
,
you
are
aware
,
are
unlawfully
detained
prisoners
by
Mistress
Alice
Nutter
.
<EOS>
Now
I
have
been
called
upon
by
the
reverend
gentleman
here
to
undertake
their
liberation
,
but
,
before
doing
so
,
I
desire
to
know
from
you
what
defensive
and
offensive
preparations
your
mistress
has
made
,
and
whether
you
judge
it
likely
she
will
attempt
to
hold
out
her
house
against
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
assuredly
she
will
,
"
replied
Blackadder
,
"
and
against
twice
your
force
.
<EOS>
Rough
Lee
is
as
strong
as
a
castle
;
and
as
those
within
it
are
well
-
armed
,
vigilant
,
and
of
good
courage
,
there
is
little
fear
of
its
capture
.
<EOS>
If
your
worship
should
propose
terms
to
my
mistress
for
the
release
of
her
prisoners
,
she
may
possibly
assent
to
them
;
but
if
you
approach
her
in
hostile
fashion
,
and
demand
their
liberation
,
I
am
well
assured
she
will
resist
you
,
and
well
assured
,
also
<EOS>
,
she
will
resist
you
effectually
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
approach
her
in
no
other
sort
than
that
of
an
enemy
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Thomas
;
"
but
thou
art
over
confident
,
knave
.
<EOS>
Unless
thy
mistress
have
a
legion
of
devils
at
her
back
,
and
they
hold
us
in
check
,
we
will
force
a
way
into
her
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Fire
and
fury
!
<EOS>
dost
presume
to
laugh
at
me
,
fellow
?
<EOS>
Take
him
hence
,
and
let
him
be
soundly
cudgeled
for
his
insolence
,
Gauntlet
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
your
worship
,
"
cried
Blackadder
,
"
<EOS>
I
only
smiled
at
the
strange
notions
you
entertain
of
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
dost
mean
to
deny
that
she
is
a
witch
?
"
demanded
Metcalfe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
if
your
worship
will
have
it
so
,
it
is
not
for
me
to
contradict
you
,
"
replied
Blackadder
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
ask
thee
is
she
not
a
servant
of
<EOS>
Satan?--dost
<EOS>
thou
not
know
it?--canst
<EOS>
thou
not
prove
it
?
"
cried
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
put
him
to
the
torture
to
make
him
confess
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
tie
his
thumbs
together
till
the
blood
burst
forth
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
said
Gauntlet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
hang
him
up
to
yon
beam
by
the
heels
,
"
suggested
Captain
Storks
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
,
"
interposed
Holden
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
bring
him
hither
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
way
,
and
I
will
not
permit
it
.
<EOS>
If
torture
is
to
be
administered
it
must
be
by
the
hands
of
justice
,
into
which
I
require
him
to
be
delivered
;
and
then
,
if
he
can
testify
aught
against
his
mistress
,
he
will
be
made
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Torture
shall
never
wring
a
word
from
me
,
whether
wrongfully
or
rightfully
applied
,
"
said
Blackadder
,
doggedly
;
"
though
I
could
tell
much
if
I
chose
.
<EOS>
Now
give
heed
to
me
,
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
take
Rough
Lee
,
still
less
its
mistress
,
without
my
help
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
thy
terms
,
knave
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
knight
,
pondering
upon
the
offer
.
"
<EOS>
And
take
heed
thou
triflest
not
with
me
,
or
I
will
have
thee
flogged
within
an
inch
of
thy
life
,
in
spite
of
parson
or
justice
.
<EOS>
What
are
thy
terms
,
I
repeat
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
for
your
worship
's
ear
alone
,
"
replied
Blackadder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beware
what
you
do
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
interposed
Holden
.
<EOS>
"
I
hold
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
,
you
are
compromising
justice
in
listening
to
the
base
proposals
of
this
man
,
who
,
while
offering
to
betray
his
mistress
,
will
assuredly
deceive
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
equally
deceive
him
in
feigning
to
agree
to
terms
which
you
can
not
fulfil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
not
fulfil
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
knight
,
highly
offended
;
"
I
would
have
you
to
know
,
sir
,
that
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
's
word
is
his
bond
,
and
that
whatsoever
he
promises
he
_
will
<EOS>
_
fulfil
in
spite
of
the
devil
!
<EOS>
Body
o
'
me
!
<EOS>
but
for
the
respect
I
owe
your
cloth
,
I
would
give
you
a
very
different
answer
,
reverend
sir
.
<EOS>
But
since
you
have
chosen
to
thrust
yourself
unasked
into
the
affair
,
I
take
leave
to
say
that
I
_
<EOS>
will
_
hear
this
knave
's
proposals
,
and
judge
for
myself
of
the
expediency
of
acceding
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
must
pray
you
therefore
,
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
you
will
not
go
hence
peaceably
,
you
shall
perforce
.
<EOS>
Take
him
away
,
gentlemen
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
enjoined
,
the
Alsatian
captains
took
each
an
arm
of
the
rector
,
and
forced
him
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
Sir
Thomas
alone
with
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Greatly
incensed
at
the
treatment
he
had
experienced
,
Holden
instantly
quitted
the
house
,
hastened
to
the
rectory
,
which
adjoined
the
church
,
and
having
given
some
messages
to
his
household
,
rode
off
to
Whalley
,
with
the
intention
of
acquainting
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
with
all
that
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
remained
closeted
with
the
prisoner
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
then
coming
forth
,
issued
orders
that
all
should
get
ready
to
start
for
Rough
Lee
without
delay
;
whereupon
each
man
emptied
his
flagon
,
pocketed
the
dice
he
had
been
cogging
,
pushed
aside
the
shuffle
-
board
,
left
the
loggats
on
the
clay
floor
of
the
barn
,
and
,
grasping
his
weapon
--
halbert
or
caliver
,
as
it
might
be
--
prepared
to
attend
his
leader
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
did
not
relate
,
even
to
the
Alsatian
captains
,
what
had
passed
between
him
and
Blackadder
;
but
it
did
not
appear
that
he
placed
entire
confidence
in
the
latter
;
for
though
he
caused
his
hands
to
be
unbound
,
and
allowed
him
in
consideration
of
his
wounded
state
to
ride
,
he
secretly
directed
Gauntlet
and
Storks
to
keep
near
him
,
and
shoot
him
through
the
head
if
he
attempted
to
escape
.
<EOS>
Both
these
personages
were
provided
with
horses
as
well
as
their
leader
,
but
all
the
rest
of
the
party
were
on
foot
.
<EOS>
Metcalfe
made
some
inquiries
after
the
rector
,
but
finding
he
was
gone
,
he
did
not
concern
himself
further
about
him
.
<EOS>
Before
starting
,
the
knight
,
who
,
with
all
his
recklessness
,
had
a
certain
sense
of
honesty
,
called
the
girl
who
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
hostel
by
Bess
,
and
gave
her
a
sum
amply
sufficient
to
cover
all
the
excesses
of
his
men
,
adding
a
handsome
gratuity
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
part
of
the
journey
was
accomplished
without
mischance
,
and
the
party
bade
fair
to
arrive
at
the
end
of
it
in
safety
;
but
as
they
entered
the
gorge
,
at
the
extremity
of
which
Rough
Lee
was
situated
,
a
terrific
storm
burst
upon
them
,
compelling
them
to
seek
shelter
in
the
mill
,
from
which
they
were
luckily
not
far
distant
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
completely
deserted
,
but
they
were
well
able
to
shift
for
themselves
,
and
not
over
scrupulous
in
the
manner
of
doing
so
;
and
as
the
remains
of
the
funeral
feast
were
not
removed
from
the
table
,
some
of
the
company
sat
down
to
them
,
while
others
found
their
way
to
the
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
The
storm
was
of
long
continuance
,
much
longer
than
was
agreeable
to
Sir
Thomas
,
and
he
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
impatiently
,
ever
and
anon
walking
to
the
window
or
door
,
to
see
whether
it
had
in
any
degree
abated
,
and
was
constantly
doomed
to
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
diminishing
,
it
increased
in
violence
,
and
it
was
now
impossible
to
quit
the
house
with
safety
.
<EOS>
The
lightning
blazed
,
the
thunder
rattled
among
the
overhanging
rocks
,
and
the
swollen
stream
of
Pendle
Water
roared
at
their
feet
.
<EOS>
Blackadder
was
left
under
the
care
of
the
two
Alsatians
,
but
while
they
had
shielded
their
eyes
from
the
glare
of
the
lightning
,
he
threw
open
the
window
,
and
,
springing
through
it
,
made
good
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
storm
it
was
in
vain
to
follow
him
,
even
if
they
had
dared
to
attempt
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
fumed
and
fretted
--
in
vain
he
heaped
curses
upon
the
bullies
for
their
negligence
--
<EOS>
in
vain
he
hurled
menaces
after
the
fugitive
:
the
former
paid
little
heed
to
his
imprecations
,
and
the
latter
was
beyond
his
reach
.
<EOS>
The
notion
began
to
gain
ground
amongst
the
rest
of
the
troop
that
the
storm
was
the
work
of
witchcraft
,
and
occasioned
general
consternation
.
<EOS>
Even
the
knight
's
anger
yielded
to
superstitious
fear
,
and
as
a
terrific
explosion
shook
the
rafters
overhead
,
and
threatened
to
bring
them
down
upon
him
,
he
fell
on
his
knees
,
and
essayed
,
with
unaccustomed
lips
,
to
murmur
a
prayer
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
interrupted
;
for
amid
the
deep
silence
succeeding
the
awful
crash
,
a
mocking
laugh
was
heard
,
and
the
villainous
countenance
of
Blackadder
,
rendered
doubly
hideous
by
the
white
lightning
,
was
seen
at
the
casement
.
<EOS>
The
sight
restored
Sir
Thomas
at
once
.
<EOS>
Drawing
his
sword
he
flew
to
the
window
,
but
before
he
could
reach
it
Blackadder
was
gone
.
<EOS>
The
next
flash
showed
what
had
befallen
him
.
<EOS>
In
stepping
backwards
,
he
tumbled
into
the
mill
-
race
;
and
the
current
,
increased
in
depth
and
force
by
the
deluging
rain
,
instantly
swept
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
after
this
,
the
violence
of
the
storm
had
perceptibly
diminished
,
and
Sir
Thomas
and
his
companions
began
to
hope
that
their
speedy
release
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Latterly
the
knight
had
abandoned
all
idea
of
attacking
Rough
Lee
,
but
with
the
prospect
of
fair
weather
his
courage
returned
,
and
he
once
more
resolved
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
moving
about
among
his
followers
,
striving
to
dispel
their
fears
,
and
persuade
them
that
the
tempest
was
only
the
result
of
natural
causes
,
when
the
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
,
giving
entrance
to
Bess
Whitaker
,
who
bore
the
miller
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
She
stared
on
seeing
the
party
assembled
,
and
knit
her
brows
,
but
said
nothing
till
she
had
deposited
Baldwyn
in
a
seat
,
when
she
observed
to
Sir
Thomas
,
that
he
seemed
to
have
little
scruple
in
taking
possession
of
a
house
in
its
owner
's
absence
.
<EOS>
The
knight
excused
himself
for
the
intrusion
by
saying
,
he
had
been
compelled
by
the
storm
to
take
refuge
there
with
his
followers
--
a
plea
readily
admitted
by
Baldwyn
,
who
was
now
able
to
speak
for
himself
;
and
the
miller
next
explained
that
he
had
been
to
Rough
Lee
,
and
after
many
perilous
adventures
,
into
the
particulars
of
which
he
did
not
enter
,
had
been
brought
away
by
Bess
,
who
had
carried
him
home
.
<EOS>
That
home
he
now
felt
would
be
a
lonely
and
insecure
one
unless
she
would
consent
to
occupy
it
with
him
;
and
Bess
,
on
being
thus
appealed
to
,
affirmed
that
the
only
motive
that
would
induce
her
to
consent
to
such
an
arrangement
would
be
her
desire
to
protect
him
from
his
mischievous
neighbours
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
discoursing
,
Old
Mitton
,
who
it
appeared
had
followed
them
,
arrived
wellnigh
exhausted
,
and
Baldwyn
went
in
search
of
some
refreshment
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
storm
had
sufficiently
cleared
off
to
allow
the
others
to
take
their
departure
;
and
though
the
miller
and
Bess
would
fain
have
dissuaded
the
knight
from
the
enterprise
,
he
was
not
to
be
turned
aside
,
but
,
bidding
his
men
attend
him
,
set
forth
.
<EOS>
The
rain
had
ceased
,
but
it
was
still
very
dark
.
<EOS>
Under
cover
of
the
gloom
,
however
,
they
thought
they
could
approach
the
house
unobserved
,
and
obtain
an
entrance
before
Mistress
Nutter
could
be
aware
of
their
arrival
.
<EOS>
In
this
expectation
they
pursued
their
way
in
silence
,
and
soon
stood
before
the
gates
.
<EOS>
These
were
fastened
,
but
as
no
one
appeared
to
be
on
the
watch
,
Sir
Thomas
,
in
a
low
tone
,
ordered
some
of
his
men
to
scale
the
walls
,
with
the
intention
of
following
himself
;
but
scarcely
had
a
head
risen
above
the
level
of
the
brickwork
than
the
flash
of
an
arquebuss
was
seen
,
and
the
man
jumped
backwards
,
luckily
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
bullet
that
whistled
over
him
.
<EOS>
An
alarm
was
then
instantly
given
,
voices
were
heard
in
the
garden
,
mingled
with
the
furious
barking
of
hounds
.
<EOS>
A
bell
was
rung
from
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
and
lights
appeared
at
the
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
some
of
the
men
,
less
alarmed
than
their
comrade
,
contrived
to
scramble
over
the
wall
,
and
were
soon
engaged
hand
to
hand
with
those
on
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
But
not
alone
had
they
to
contend
with
adversaries
like
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
stag
-
hounds
,
which
had
done
so
much
execution
during
the
first
attack
upon
the
house
by
Roger
Nowell
,
raged
amongst
them
like
so
many
lions
,
rending
their
limbs
,
and
seizing
their
throats
.
<EOS>
To
free
themselves
from
these
formidable
antagonists
was
their
first
business
,
and
by
dint
of
thrust
from
pike
,
cut
from
sword
,
and
ball
from
caliver
,
they
succeeded
in
slaughtering
two
of
them
,
and
driving
the
others
,
badly
wounded
,
and
savagely
howling
,
away
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
however
,
they
themselves
had
sustained
considerable
injury
.
<EOS>
Three
of
their
number
were
lying
on
the
ground
,
in
no
condition
,
from
their
broken
heads
,
or
shattered
limbs
,
for
renewing
the
combat
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
so
far
as
the
siege
had
gone
,
success
seemed
to
declare
itself
rather
for
the
defenders
than
the
assailants
,
when
a
new
impulse
was
given
to
the
latter
,
by
the
bursting
open
of
the
gates
,
and
the
sudden
influx
of
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
and
the
rest
of
his
troop
.
<EOS>
The
knight
was
closely
followed
by
the
Alsatian
captains
,
who
,
with
tremendous
oaths
in
their
mouths
,
and
slashing
blades
in
their
hands
,
declared
they
would
make
minced
meat
of
any
one
opposing
their
progress
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
was
equally
truculent
in
expression
and
ferocious
in
tone
,
and
as
the
whole
party
laid
about
them
right
and
left
,
they
speedily
routed
the
defenders
of
the
garden
,
and
drove
them
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
Flushed
by
their
success
,
the
besiegers
shouted
loudly
,
and
Sir
Thomas
roared
out
,
that
ere
many
minutes
Nowell
and
Potts
should
be
set
free
,
and
Alice
Nutter
captured
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
could
reach
the
main
door
,
Nicholas
Assheton
,
well
armed
,
and
attended
by
some
dozen
men
,
presented
himself
at
it
.
<EOS>
These
were
instantly
joined
by
the
retreating
party
,
and
the
whole
offered
a
formidable
array
of
opponents
,
quite
sufficient
to
check
the
progress
of
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
of
the
men
near
Nicholas
carried
torches
,
and
their
light
revealed
the
numbers
on
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
is
it
you
,
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
commit
such
outrages
as
this
--
do
you
break
into
habitations
like
a
robber
,
rifle
them
,
and
murder
their
inmates
?
<EOS>
Explain
yourself
,
sir
,
or
I
will
treat
you
as
I
would
a
common
plunderer
;
shoot
you
through
the
head
,
or
hang
you
to
the
first
tree
if
I
take
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Zounds
and
fury
!
"
rejoined
Metcalfe
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
dare
to
liken
me
to
a
common
robber
and
murderer
?
<EOS>
Take
care
<EOS>
you
do
not
experience
the
same
fate
as
that
with
which
you
threaten
me
,
with
this
difference
only
,
that
the
hangman
--
the
common
hangman
of
Lancaster
--
shall
serve
your
turn
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
hither
to
arrest
a
notorious
witch
,
and
to
release
two
gentlemen
who
are
unlawfully
detained
prisoners
by
her
;
and
if
you
do
not
instantly
deliver
her
up
to
me
,
and
produce
the
two
individuals
in
question
,
Master
Roger
Nowell
and
Master
Potts
,
I
will
force
my
way
into
the
house
,
and
all
injury
done
to
those
who
oppose
me
will
rest
on
your
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
two
gentlemen
you
have
named
are
perfectly
safe
and
contented
in
their
quarters
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
and
as
to
the
foul
and
false
aspersions
you
have
thrown
out
against
Mistress
Nutter
,
I
cast
them
back
in
your
teeth
.
<EOS>
Your
purpose
in
coming
hither
is
to
redress
some
private
wrong
.
<EOS>
How
is
it
you
have
such
a
rout
with
you
?
<EOS>
How
is
it
I
behold
two
notorious
bravos
by
your
side
--
men
who
have
stood
in
the
pillory
,
and
undergone
other
ignominious
punishment
for
their
offences
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
answer
,
and
their
oaths
and
threats
go
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
now
tell
you
,
Sir
Thomas
,
if
you
do
not
instantly
withdraw
your
men
,
and
quit
these
premises
,
grievous
consequences
will
ensue
to
you
and
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
hear
no
more
,
"
cried
Sir
Thomas
,
infuriated
to
the
last
degree
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Follow
me
into
the
house
,
and
spare
none
who
oppose
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
in
yet
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
a
row
of
pikes
bristled
around
him
,
holding
the
knight
at
bay
,
while
a
hook
was
fixed
in
the
doublet
of
each
of
the
Alsatian
captains
,
and
they
were
plucked
forward
and
dragged
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
Nicholas
and
his
men
quickly
retreated
,
and
the
door
was
closed
and
barred
upon
the
enraged
and
discomfited
knight
.

CHAPTER
XV.--THE
PHANTOM
MONK
.
  
<EOS>
Many
hours
had
passed
by
,
and
night
had
come
on
--
a
night
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
Richard
was
still
lying
where
he
had
fallen
at
the
foot
of
Malkin
Tower
;
for
though
he
had
regained
his
sensibility
,
he
was
so
bruised
and
shaken
as
to
be
wholly
unable
to
move
.
<EOS>
His
limbs
,
stiffened
and
powerless
,
refused
their
office
,
and
,
after
each
unsuccessful
effort
,
he
sank
back
with
a
groan
.
 
<EOS>
His
sole
hope
was
that
Mistress
Nutter
,
alarmed
by
his
prolonged
absence
,
might
come
to
her
daughter
's
assistance
,
and
so
discover
his
forlorn
situation
;
but
as
time
flew
by
,
and
nothing
occurred
,
he
gave
himself
up
for
lost
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
sudden
the
gloom
was
dispersed
,
and
a
silvery
light
shed
over
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
moon
had
broken
through
a
rack
of
clouds
,
and
illumined
the
tall
mysterious
tower
,
and
the
dreary
waste
around
it
.
<EOS>
With
the
light
a
ghostly
figure
near
him
became
visible
to
Richard
,
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
excited
terror
in
his
breast
,
but
which
now
only
filled
him
with
wonder
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
a
Cistertian
monk
;
the
vestments
were
old
and
faded
,
the
visage
white
and
corpse
-
like
.
<EOS>
Richard
at
once
recognised
the
phantom
he
had
seen
in
the
banquet
-
hall
at
the
Abbey
,
and
had
afterwards
so
rashly
followed
to
the
conventual
church
.
<EOS>
It
touched
him
with
its
icy
fingers
,
and
a
dullness
like
death
shot
through
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
dost
thou
trouble
me
thus
,
unhappy
spirit
?
"
said
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
I
adjure
thee
,
and
let
me
die
in
peace
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
wilt
not
die
yet
,
Richard
Assheton
,
"
returned
the
phantom
;
"
and
my
intention
is
not
to
trouble
thee
,
but
to
serve
thee
.
<EOS>
Without
my
aid
thou
wouldst
perish
where
thou
liest
,
but
I
will
raise
thee
up
,
and
set
thee
on
thy
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wilt
thou
help
me
to
liberate
Alizon
?
"
demanded
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
concern
thyself
further
about
her
,
"
replied
the
phantom
;
"
she
must
pass
through
an
ordeal
with
which
nothing
human
may
interfere
.
<EOS>
If
she
escape
it
you
will
meet
again
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
it
were
better
thou
shouldst
<EOS>
be
in
thy
grave
than
see
her
.
<EOS>
Take
this
phial
.
<EOS>
Drink
thou
<EOS>
the
liquid
it
contains
,
and
thy
strength
will
return
to
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
know
thou
art
not
sent
hither
by
Mother
Demdike
to
tempt
me
?
"
demanded
Richard
,
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
fallen
into
her
snares
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
groan
.
 
<EOS>
[

THE
PHANTOM
MONK
.
]
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
Mother
Demdike
's
enemy
,
and
the
appointed
instrument
of
her
punishment
,
"
replied
the
monk
,
in
a
tone
that
did
not
admit
of
question
.
<EOS>
"
Drink
,
and
fear
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
obeyed
,
and
the
next
moment
sprang
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
hast
indeed
restored
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
fain
reach
the
secret
entrance
to
the
tower
.
"
 
"
Attempt
it
not
,
I
charge
thee
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
phantom
;
"
but
depart
instantly
for
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wherefore
should
I
go
thither
?
"
demanded
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
wilt
learn
anon
,
"
returned
the
monk
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
thee
more
now
.
<EOS>
Dismount
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
and
proceed
to
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
Thou
know'st
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
There
a
fire
was
lighted
which
was
meant
to
set
all
England
in
a
blaze
.
"
 
"
<EOS>
And
which
led
many
good
men
to
destruction
,
"
said
the
monk
,
in
a
tone
of
indescribable
sadness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
for
him
who
kindled
it
.
<EOS>
The
offence
is
not
yet
worked
out
.
<EOS>
But
depart
without
more
delay
;
and
look
not
back
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Richard
hastened
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
left
Merlin
,
he
fancied
he
was
followed
by
the
phantom
;
but
,
obedient
to
the
injunction
he
received
,
he
did
not
turn
his
head
.
<EOS>
As
he
mounted
the
horse
,
who
neighed
cheerily
as
he
drew
near
,
he
found
he
was
right
in
supposing
the
monk
to
be
behind
him
,
for
he
heard
his
voice
calling
out
,
"
Linger
not
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
To
the
beacon!--to
the
beacon
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
exhorted
,
the
young
man
dashed
off
,
and
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
found
Merlin
as
fresh
as
if
he
had
undergone
no
fatigue
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
would
almost
seem
,
from
his
spirit
,
that
he
had
partaken
of
the
same
wondrous
elixir
which
had
revived
his
master
.
<EOS>
Down
the
hill
he
plunged
,
regardless
of
the
steep
descent
,
and
soon
entered
the
thicket
where
the
storm
had
fallen
upon
them
,
and
where
so
many
acts
of
witchcraft
were
performed
.
<EOS>
Now
,
neither
accident
nor
obstacle
occurred
to
check
the
headlong
pace
of
the
animal
,
though
the
stones
rattled
after
him
as
he
struck
them
with
his
flying
hoof
.
<EOS>
The
moonlight
quivered
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
,
and
on
the
tender
spray
,
and
all
looked
as
tranquil
and
beautiful
as
it
had
so
lately
been
gloomy
and
disturbed
.
<EOS>
The
wood
was
passed
,
and
the
last
and
steepest
descent
cleared
.
<EOS>
The
little
bridge
was
at
hand
,
and
beneath
was
Pendle
Water
,
rushing
over
its
rocky
bed
,
and
glittering
like
silver
in
the
moon
's
rays
.
<EOS>
But
here
Richard
had
wellnigh
received
a
check
.
<EOS>
A
party
of
armed
men
,
it
proved
,
occupied
the
road
leading
to
Rough
Lee
,
about
a
bow
-
shot
from
the
bridge
,
and
as
soon
as
they
perceived
he
was
taking
the
opposite
course
,
with
the
apparent
intention
of
avoiding
them
,
they
shouted
to
him
to
stay
.
<EOS>
This
shout
made
Richard
aware
of
their
presence
,
for
he
had
not
before
observed
them
,
as
they
were
concealed
by
the
intervention
of
some
small
trees
;
but
though
surprised
at
the
circumstance
,
and
not
without
apprehension
that
they
might
be
there
with
a
hostile
design
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
he
did
not
slacken
his
pace
.
<EOS>
A
horseman
,
who
appeared
to
be
their
leader
,
rode
after
him
for
a
short
distance
,
but
finding
pursuit
futile
,
he
desisted
,
pouring
forth
a
volley
of
oaths
and
threats
,
in
a
voice
that
proclaimed
him
as
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
.
<EOS>
This
discovery
confirmed
Richard
in
his
supposition
that
mischief
was
intended
Mistress
Nutter
;
but
even
this
conviction
,
strengthened
by
his
antipathy
to
Metcalfe
,
was
not
sufficiently
strong
to
induce
him
to
stop
.
<EOS>
Promising
himself
to
return
on
the
morrow
,
and
settle
accounts
with
the
insolent
knight
,
he
speeded
on
,
and
,
passing
the
mill
,
tracked
the
rocky
gorge
above
it
,
and
began
to
mount
another
hill
.
<EOS>
Despite
the
ascent
,
Merlin
never
slackened
his
pace
,
but
,
though
his
master
would
have
restrained
him
,
held
on
as
before
.
<EOS>
But
the
brow
of
the
hill
attained
,
Richard
compelled
him
to
a
brief
halt
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
sky
was
comparatively
clear
,
but
small
clouds
were
sailing
across
the
heavens
,
and
at
one
moment
the
moon
would
be
obscured
by
them
,
and
the
next
,
burst
forth
with
sudden
effulgence
.
<EOS>
These
alternations
produced
corresponding
effects
on
the
broad
,
brown
,
heathy
plain
extending
below
,
and
fantastic
shadows
were
cast
upon
it
,
which
it
needed
not
Richard
's
heated
imagination
to
liken
to
evil
beings
flying
past
.
<EOS>
The
wind
,
too
,
lay
in
the
direction
of
the
north
end
of
Pendle
Hill
,
whither
Richard
was
about
to
shape
his
course
,
and
the
shadows
consequently
trooped
off
towards
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
vast
mass
of
Pendle
rose
in
gloomy
majesty
before
him
,
being
thrown
into
shade
,
except
at
its
crown
,
where
a
flood
of
radiance
rested
.
 
<EOS>
Like
an
eagle
swooping
upon
his
prey
,
Richard
descended
into
the
valley
,
and
like
a
stag
pursued
by
the
huntsman
he
speeded
across
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
dyke
,
morass
,
nor
stone
wall
checked
him
,
or
made
him
turn
aside
;
and
almost
as
fast
as
the
clouds
hurrying
above
him
,
and
their
shadows
travelling
at
his
feet
,
did
he
reach
the
base
of
Pendle
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Making
up
to
a
shed
,
which
,
though
empty
,
luckily
contained
a
wisp
or
two
of
hay
,
he
turned
Merlin
into
it
,
and
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
hill
on
foot
.
<EOS>
After
attaining
a
considerable
elevation
,
he
looked
down
from
the
giddy
heights
upon
the
valley
he
had
just
traversed
.
<EOS>
A
few
huts
,
forming
the
little
village
of
Barley
,
lay
sleeping
in
the
moonlight
beneath
him
,
while
further
off
could
be
just
discerned
Goldshaw
,
with
its
embowered
church
.
<EOS>
A
line
of
thin
vapour
marked
the
course
of
Pendle
Water
,
and
thicker
mists
hovered
over
the
mosses
.
<EOS>
The
shadows
were
still
passing
over
the
plain
.
 
<EOS>
Pressing
on
,
Richard
soon
came
among
the
rocks
protruding
from
the
higher
part
of
the
hill
,
and
as
the
path
was
here
not
more
than
a
foot
wide
,
rarely
taken
except
by
the
sheep
and
their
guardians
,
it
was
necessary
to
proceed
with
the
utmost
caution
,
as
a
single
false
step
would
have
been
fatal
.
<EOS>
After
some
toil
,
and
not
without
considerable
risk
,
he
reached
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
bounded
over
the
springy
turf
,
and
inhaled
the
pure
air
of
that
exalted
region
,
his
spirits
revived
,
and
new
elasticity
was
communicated
to
his
limbs
.
<EOS>
He
shaped
his
course
near
the
edge
of
the
hill
,
so
that
the
extensive
view
it
commanded
was
fully
displayed
.
<EOS>
But
his
eye
rested
on
the
mountainous
range
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
,
where
Malkin
Tower
was
situated
.
<EOS>
Even
in
broad
day
the
accursed
structure
would
have
been
invisible
,
as
it
stood
on
the
further
side
of
the
hill
,
overlooking
Barrowford
and
Colne
;
but
Richard
knew
its
position
well
,
and
while
his
gaze
was
fixed
upon
the
point
,
he
saw
a
star
shoot
down
from
the
heavens
and
apparently
alight
near
the
spot
.
<EOS>
The
circumstance
alarmed
him
,
for
he
could
not
help
thinking
it
ominous
of
ill
to
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
followed
to
increase
his
misgivings
,
and
erelong
he
came
in
sight
of
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
The
ground
had
been
gradually
rising
,
and
if
he
had
proceeded
a
few
hundred
yards
further
,
a
vast
panorama
would
have
opened
upon
him
,
comprising
a
large
part
of
Lancashire
on
the
one
hand
,
and
on
the
other
an
equally
extensive
portion
of
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
Forest
and
fell
,
black
moor
and
bright
stream
,
old
castle
and
stately
hall
,
would
have
then
been
laid
before
him
as
in
a
map
.
<EOS>
But
other
thoughts
engrossed
him
,
and
he
went
straight
on
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
he
could
discern
he
was
alone
on
the
hill
top
;
and
the
silence
and
solitude
,
coupled
with
the
ill
report
of
the
place
,
which
at
this
hour
was
said
to
be
often
visited
by
foul
hags
,
for
the
performance
of
their
unhallowed
rites
,
awakened
superstitious
fears
in
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
soon
by
the
side
of
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
The
stones
were
still
standing
as
they
had
been
reared
by
Paslew
,
and
on
looking
at
them
he
was
astonished
to
find
the
hollow
within
them
filled
with
dry
furze
,
brushwood
,
and
fagots
,
as
if
in
readiness
for
another
signal
.
<EOS>
In
passing
round
the
circle
,
his
surprise
was
still
further
increased
by
discovering
a
torch
,
and
not
far
from
it
,
in
one
of
the
interstices
of
the
stones
,
a
dark
lantern
,
in
which
,
on
removing
the
shade
,
he
found
a
candle
burning
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
clear
the
beacon
was
to
be
kindled
that
night
,
though
for
what
end
he
could
not
conjecture
,
and
equally
clear
that
he
was
brought
thither
to
fire
it
.
<EOS>
He
put
back
the
lantern
into
its
place
,
took
up
the
torch
,
and
held
himself
in
readiness
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
elapsed
,
and
nothing
occurred
.
<EOS>
During
this
interval
it
had
become
dark
.
<EOS>
A
curtain
of
clouds
was
drawn
over
the
moon
and
stars
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
a
hurtling
noise
was
heard
in
the
air
,
and
it
seemed
to
the
watcher
as
if
a
troop
of
witches
were
alighting
at
a
distance
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
loud
hubbub
of
voices
ensued
--
then
there
was
a
trampling
of
feet
,
accompanied
by
discordant
strains
of
music
--
after
which
a
momentary
silence
ensued
,
and
a
harsh
voice
asked--
 
<EOS>
"
Why
are
we
brought
hither
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
for
a
sabbath
,
"
shouted
another
voice
,
"
for
there
is
neither
fire
nor
caldron
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
Demdike
would
not
summon
us
without
good
reason
,
"
cried
a
third
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
learn
presently
what
we
have
to
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
more
mischief
the
better
,
"
rejoined
another
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
mischief
!
mischief
!
mischief
!
"
echoed
the
rest
of
the
crew
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
enough
of
it
to
content
you
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
called
you
hither
to
be
present
at
a
sacrifice
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hideous
screams
of
laughter
followed
this
announcement
,
and
the
voice
that
had
spoken
first
asked--
 
<EOS>
"
A
sacrifice
of
whom
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
unbaptised
babe
,
stolen
from
its
sleeping
mother
's
breast
,
"
rejoined
another
.
"
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
has
often
played
that
trick
before
--
ho
!
ho
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
thundered
the
hag--"It
is
no
babe
I
am
about
to
kill
,
but
a
full
-
grown
maid
--
<EOS>
ay
,
and
one
of
rarest
beauty
,
too
.
<EOS>
What
think
ye
of
Alizon
Device
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
grand
-
daughter
!
"
cried
several
voices
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alice
Nutter
's
daughter
--
for
such
she
is
,
"
rejoined
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
held
her
captive
in
Malkin
Tower
,
and
have
subjected
her
to
every
trial
and
temptation
I
could
devise
,
but
I
have
failed
in
shaking
her
courage
,
or
in
winning
her
over
to
our
master
.
<EOS>
All
the
horrors
of
the
vault
have
been
tried
upon
her
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Even
the
last
terrible
ordeal
,
which
no
one
has
hitherto
sustained
,
proved
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
She
went
through
it
unmoved
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
I
have
no
power
over
her
soul
"
pursued
the
hag
;
"
but
I
have
over
her
body
,
and
she
shall
die
here
,
and
by
my
hand
.
<EOS>
But
mind
me
,
not
a
drop
of
blood
must
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
fear
,
"
cried
several
voices
,
"
we
will
catch
it
in
our
palms
and
quaff
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hast
thou
thy
knife
,
Mould
-
heels
?
"
asked
Mother
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
it
is
long
and
sharp
,
and
will
do
thy
business
well
.
<EOS>
Thy
grandson
,
Jem
Device
,
notched
it
by
killing
swine
,
and
my
goodman
ground
it
only
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Take
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
plunge
it
to
her
heart
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mother
Demdike
,
with
an
infernal
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
I
will
tell
you
why
we
have
neither
fire
nor
caldron
.
<EOS>
On
questioning
the
ebon
image
in
the
vault
as
to
the
place
where
the
sacrifice
should
be
made
,
I
received
for
answer
that
it
must
be
here
,
and
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
No
human
eye
but
our
own
must
behold
it
.
<EOS>
We
are
safe
on
this
score
,
for
no
one
is
likely
to
come
hither
at
this
hour
.
<EOS>
No
fire
must
be
kindled
,
or
the
sacrifice
will
result
in
destruction
to
us
all
.
<EOS>
Ye
have
heard
,
and
understand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
,
"
replied
several
husky
voices
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
do
I
,
"
said
Richard
,
taking
hold
of
the
dark
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
for
the
girl
,
"
cried
Mother
Demdike
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVI.--ONE
O'CLOCK
!
  
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
and
Mother
Chattox
were
still
at
the
hut
,
impatiently
awaiting
the
return
of
Fancy
.
<EOS>
But
nearly
an
hour
elapsed
before
he
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
detained
thee
so
long
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
hag
,
sharply
,
as
he
stood
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
mistress
,
"
replied
Fancy
:
"
I
have
had
a
busy
time
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
and
thought
I
should
never
accomplish
my
errand
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
Rough
Lee
,
I
found
the
place
invested
by
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
and
a
host
of
armed
men
,
who
had
been
sent
thither
by
Parson
Holden
,
for
the
joint
purpose
of
arresting
you
,
madam
,
"
addressing
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
liberating
Nowell
and
Potts
.
<EOS>
The
knight
was
in
a
great
fume
;
for
,
in
spite
of
the
force
brought
against
it
,
the
house
had
been
stoutly
defended
by
Nicholas
Assheton
,
who
had
worsted
the
besieging
party
,
and
captured
two
Alsatian
captains
,
hangers
on
of
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
Appearing
in
the
character
of
an
enemy
,
I
was
immediately
surrounded
by
Metcalfe
and
his
men
,
who
swore
they
would
cut
my
throat
unless
I
undertook
to
procure
the
liberation
of
the
two
bravos
in
question
,
as
well
as
that
of
Nowell
and
Potts
.
<EOS>
I
told
them
I
was
come
for
the
express
purpose
of
setting
free
the
two
last
-
named
gentlemen
;
but
,
with
respect
to
the
former
,
I
had
no
instructions
,
and
they
must
arrange
the
matter
with
Master
Nicholas
himself
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
Sir
Thomas
became
exceedingly
wroth
and
insolent
,
and
proceeded
to
such
lengths
that
I
resolved
to
chastise
him
,
and
in
so
doing
performed
a
feat
which
will
tend
greatly
to
exalt
Richard
's
character
for
courage
and
strength
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hear
it
,
my
doughty
champion
,
"
cried
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
While
Metcalfe
was
pouring
forth
his
rage
,
and
menacing
me
with
uplifted
hand
,
"
pursued
the
familiar
,
"
I
seized
him
by
the
throat
,
dragged
him
from
his
horse
,
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
his
men
,
whose
blows
fell
upon
me
thick
as
hail
,
and
quite
as
harmlessly
,
I
bore
him
through
the
garden
to
the
back
of
the
house
,
where
my
shouts
soon
brought
Nicholas
and
others
to
my
assistance
,
and
after
delivering
my
captive
to
them
,
I
dismounted
.
<EOS>
The
squire
,
you
will
imagine
,
was
astonished
to
see
me
,
and
greatly
applauded
my
prowess
.
<EOS>
I
replied
,
with
the
modesty
becoming
my
assumed
character
,
that
I
had
done
nothing
,
and
,
in
reality
,
the
feat
was
nothing
to
me
;
but
I
told
him
I
had
something
of
the
utmost
importance
to
communicate
,
and
which
could
not
be
delayed
a
moment
;
whereupon
he
led
me
to
a
small
room
adjoining
the
hall
,
while
the
crestfallen
knight
was
left
to
vent
his
rage
and
mortification
on
the
grooms
to
whose
custody
he
was
committed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
acted
your
part
to
perfection
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
trust
my
sweet
Fancy
for
that
,
"
said
the
hag--"there
is
no
familiar
like
him
--
none
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
praises
make
me
blush
,
"
rejoined
Fancy
.
"
<EOS>
But
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
I
fulfilled
your
instructions
to
the
letter
,
and
excited
Nicholas
's
horror
and
indignation
by
the
tale
I
told
him
.
<EOS>
I
laughed
in
my
sleeve
all
the
while
,
but
I
maintained
a
very
different
countenance
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
thought
me
full
of
anguish
and
despair
.
<EOS>
He
questioned
me
as
to
my
proceedings
at
Malkin
Tower
,
and
I
amazed
him
with
the
description
of
a
fearful
storm
I
had
encountered
--
of
my
interview
with
old
Demdike
,
and
her
atrocious
treatment
of
Alizon
--
to
all
of
which
he
listened
with
profound
interest
.
<EOS>
Richard
himself
could
not
have
moved
him
more
--
perhaps
not
so
much
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
had
finished
,
he
vowed
he
would
rescue
Alizon
from
the
murtherous
hag
,
and
prevent
the
latter
from
committing
further
mischief
;
and
bidding
me
come
with
him
,
we
repaired
to
the
room
in
which
Nowell
and
Potts
were
confined
.
<EOS>
We
found
them
both
fast
asleep
in
their
chairs
;
but
Nicholas
quickly
awakened
them
,
and
some
explanations
ensued
,
which
did
not
at
first
appear
very
clear
and
satisfactory
to
either
magistrate
or
attorney
,
but
in
the
end
they
agreed
to
accompany
us
on
the
expedition
,
Master
Potts
declaring
it
would
compensate
him
for
all
his
mischances
if
he
could
arrest
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
may
have
his
wish
,
"
said
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
he
declared
that
his
next
step
should
be
to
arrest
you
,
mistress
,
"
observed
Fancy
,
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Arrest
me
!
"
cried
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Marry
,
let
him
touch
me
,
if
he
dares
.
<EOS>
My
term
is
not
out
yet
,
and
,
with
thee
to
defend
me
,
<EOS>
my
brave
Fancy
,
I
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Right
!
"
replied
the
familiar
;
"
but
to
go
on
with
my
story
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
was
next
brought
forward
;
and
after
some
warm
altercation
,
peace
was
at
length
established
between
him
and
the
squire
,
and
hands
were
shaken
all
round
.
<EOS>
Wine
was
then
called
for
by
Nicholas
,
who
,
at
the
same
time
,
directed
that
the
two
Alsatian
captains
should
be
brought
up
from
the
cellar
,
where
they
had
been
placed
for
safety
.
<EOS>
The
first
part
of
the
order
was
obeyed
,
but
the
second
was
found
impracticable
,
inasmuch
as
the
two
heroes
had
found
their
way
to
the
inner
cellar
,
and
had
emptied
so
many
flasks
that
they
were
utterly
incapable
of
moving
.
<EOS>
While
the
wine
was
being
discussed
,
an
unexpected
arrival
took
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
arrival!--of
whom
?
"
inquired
Mistress
Nutter
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
and
a
large
party
,
"
replied
Fancy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Parson
Holden
,
it
seems
,
not
content
with
sending
Sir
Thomas
and
his
rout
to
the
aid
of
his
friends
,
had
proceeded
for
the
same
purpose
to
Whalley
,
and
the
result
was
the
appearance
of
the
new
party
.
<EOS>
A
brief
explanation
from
Nicholas
and
myself
served
to
put
Sir
Ralph
in
possession
of
all
that
had
occurred
,
and
he
declared
his
readiness
to
accompany
the
expedition
to
Pendle
Hill
,
and
to
take
all
his
followers
with
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
expressed
an
equally
strong
desire
to
go
with
him
,
and
of
course
it
was
acceded
to
.
<EOS>
I
am
bound
to
tell
you
,
madam
,
"
added
Fancy
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
that
your
conduct
is
viewed
in
a
most
suspicious
light
by
every
one
of
these
persons
,
except
Nicholas
,
who
made
an
effort
to
defend
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
what
happens
to
me
,
if
I
succeed
in
rescuing
my
child
,
"
said
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
have
they
set
out
on
the
expedition
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
this
time
,
no
doubt
they
have
,
"
replied
Fancy
.
<EOS>
"
I
got
off
by
saying
I
would
ride
on
to
Pendle
Hill
,
and
,
stationing
myself
on
its
summit
,
give
them
a
signal
when
they
should
advance
upon
their
prey
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
good
mistress
,
I
pray
you
dismiss
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
cast
off
this
shape
,
which
I
find
an
incumbrance
,
and
resume
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
will
return
when
it
is
time
for
you
to
set
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
hag
waved
her
hand
,
and
the
familiar
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
elapsed
,
and
he
returned
not
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
became
fearfully
impatient
.
<EOS>
Three
-
quarters
,
and
even
the
old
hag
was
uneasy
.
<EOS>
An
hour
,
and
he
stood
before
them
--
dwarfish
,
fiendish
,
monstrous
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
time
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
harsh
voice
;
but
the
tones
were
music
in
the
wretched
mother
's
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
,
"
she
cried
,
rushing
wildly
forth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
I
come
,
"
replied
the
hag
,
following
her
.
"
<EOS>
Not
so
fast
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
go
without
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
either
of
you
without
me
,
"
added
Fancy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
good
mistress
,
is
your
broomstick
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Away
for
Pendle
Hill
!
"
screamed
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
for
Pendle
Hill
!
"
echoed
Fancy
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
whirling
of
dark
figures
through
the
air
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
they
alighted
on
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
,
which
seemed
to
be
wrapped
in
a
dense
cloud
,
for
Mistress
Nutter
could
scarcely
see
a
yard
before
her
.
<EOS>
Fancy
's
eyes
,
however
,
were
powerful
enough
to
penetrate
the
gloom
,
for
stepping
back
a
few
yards
<EOS>
,
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
The
expedition
is
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
where
they
have
made
a
halt
.
<EOS>
We
must
wait
a
few
moments
,
till
I
can
ascertain
what
they
mean
to
do
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
.
<EOS>
They
are
dividing
into
three
parties
.
<EOS>
One
detachment
,
headed
by
Nicholas
Assheton
,
with
whom
are
Potts
and
Nowell
,
is
about
to
make
the
ascent
from
the
spot
where
they
now
stand
;
another
,
commanded
by
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
is
moving
towards
the
but
-
end
of
the
hill
;
and
the
third
,
headed
by
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
,
is
proceeding
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
These
are
goodly
preparations
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
But
,
what
do
I
behold
?
<EOS>
The
first
detachment
have
a
prisoner
with
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
Jem
Device
,
whom
they
have
captured
on
the
way
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
from
the
rascal
's
looks
that
he
is
planning
an
escape
.
<EOS>
Patience
,
madam
,
I
must
see
how
he
executes
his
design
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
hurry
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
scrambling
up
the
hill
-
sides
.
<EOS>
Some
one
slips
,
and
rolls
down
,
and
bruises
himself
severely
against
the
loose
stones
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
it
is
Master
Potts
.
<EOS>
He
is
picked
up
by
James
Device
,
who
takes
him
on
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
What
means
the
knave
by
such
attention
?
<EOS>
We
shall
see
anon
.
<EOS>
They
continue
to
fight
their
way
upward
,
and
have
now
reached
the
narrow
path
among
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
Take
heed
,
or
your
necks
will
be
broken
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
Well
done
,
Jem,--bravo
!
<EOS>
lad
.
<EOS>
Thy
scheme
is
out
now
--
ho
!
ho
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
he
done
?
"
asked
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
Run
off
with
the
attorney
--
with
Master
Potts
,
"
replied
Fancy
;
"
disappeared
in
the
gloom
,
so
that
it
is
impossible
Nicholas
can
follow
him
--
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
my
child!--where
is
my
child
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
in
agitated
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
and
I
will
lead
you
to
her
,
"
replied
Fancy
,
taking
her
hand
;
"
and
do
you
keep
close
to
us
,
mistress
,
"
he
added
to
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
Moving
quickly
along
the
heathy
plain
,
they
soon
reached
a
small
dry
hollow
,
about
a
hundred
paces
from
the
beacon
,
in
the
midst
of
which
,
as
in
a
grave
,
was
deposited
the
inanimate
form
of
Alizon
.
<EOS>
When
the
spot
was
indicated
to
her
by
Fancy
,
the
miserable
mother
flew
to
it
,
and
,
with
indescribable
delight
,
clasped
her
child
to
her
breast
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
moment
,
a
new
fear
seized
her
,
for
the
limbs
were
stiff
and
cold
,
and
the
heart
had
apparently
ceased
to
beat
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
dead
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mistress
Nutter
,
frantically
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
she
is
only
in
a
magical
trance
,
"
said
Fancy
;
"
my
mistress
can
instantly
revive
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Prithee
do
so
,
then
,
good
Chattox
,
"
implored
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
defer
it
till
we
have
taken
her
hence
,
"
rejoined
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
no
,
now
--
now
!
<EOS>
Let
me
be
assured
she
lives
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
Chattox
reluctantly
assented
,
and
,
touching
Alizon
with
her
skinny
finger
,
first
upon
the
heart
and
then
upon
the
brow
,
the
poor
girl
began
to
show
symptoms
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
child
--
my
child
!
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
straining
her
to
her
breast
;
"
I
am
come
to
save
thee
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
scarce
succeed
,
if
you
tarry
here
longer
,
"
said
Fancy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Away
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
come
away
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
the
hag
,
seizing
Alizon
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
about
to
take
her
?
"
asked
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
my
hut
,
"
replied
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
--
she
shall
not
go
there
,
"
returned
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
wherefore
not
?
"
screamed
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
is
mine
now
,
and
I
say
she
_
shall
_
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Right
,
mistress
,
"
said
Fancy
;
"
and
leave
the
lady
here
if
she
objects
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
But
be
quick
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
take
her
from
me
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Mistress
Nutter
,
holding
her
daughter
fast
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
through
your
diabolical
purpose
.
<EOS>
You
have
the
same
dark
design
as
Mother
Demdike
,
and
would
sacrifice
her
;
but
she
shall
not
go
with
you
,
neither
will
I.
"
 
"
Tut
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
hag
,
"
you
have
lost
your
senses
on
a
sudden
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
come
away
,
or
Mother
Demdike
will
surprise
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
trifle
with
her
longer
,
"
whispered
Fancy
to
the
hag
;
"
drag
the
girl
away
,
or
you
will
lose
her
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
,
and
it
will
be
too
late
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mother
Chattox
made
an
attempt
to
obey
him
,
but
Mistress
Nutter
resisted
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Curses
on
her
!
"
<EOS>
she
muttered
,
"
she
is
too
strong
for
me
.
<EOS>
Do
thou
help
me
,
"
she
added
,
appealing
to
Fancy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
he
replied
;
"
I
have
done
all
I
dare
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
accomplish
the
rest
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
sweet
imp
,
recollect--
"
 
"
I
recollect
I
have
a
master
,
"
interrupted
the
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
a
mistress
,
too
,
"
cried
the
hag
;
"
and
she
will
chastise
thee
if
thou
art
disobedient
.
<EOS>
I
command
thee
to
carry
off
this
girl
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
told
you
I
dare
not
,
and
I
now
say
I
will
not
,
"
replied
Fancy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
not
!
"
shrieked
the
hag
.
"
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
smart
for
this
.
<EOS>
I
will
bury
thee
in
the
heart
of
this
mountain
,
and
make
thee
labour
within
it
like
a
gnome
.
<EOS>
I
will
set
thee
to
count
the
sands
on
the
river
's
bed
,
and
the
leaves
on
the
forest
trees
.
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
know
neither
rest
nor
respite
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ho
!
ho
!
ho
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
Fancy
,
mockingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dost
deride
me
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
,
thou
saucy
jackanapes
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
time
,
wilt
obey
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Fancy
,
"
and
for
this
reason
--
<EOS>
your
term
is
out
.
<EOS>
It
expired
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
the
hag
,
in
accents
of
mixed
terror
and
rage
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
months
to
run
,
and
will
renew
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Before
midnight
,
you
might
have
done
so
;
but
it
is
now
too
late
--
<EOS>
your
reign
is
over
,
"
rejoined
Fancy
.
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
sweet
mistress
.
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
once
again
,
though
scarcely
under
such
pleasant
circumstances
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
,
<EOS>
my
darling
Fancy
;
thou
art
jesting
with
me
,
"
whimpered
the
hag
;
"
thou
wouldst
not
delude
thy
doating
mistress
thus
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
with
thee
,
foul
hag
,
"
rejoined
the
familiar
,
"
and
am
right
glad
my
service
is
ended
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
saved
thee
,
but
would
not
,
and
delayed
my
return
for
that
very
purpose
.
<EOS>
Thy
soul
was
forfeited
when
I
came
back
to
thy
hut
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
curses
on
thee
for
thy
treachery
,
"
cried
the
hag
,
"
and
on
thy
master
,
who
deceived
me
in
the
bond
he
placed
before
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
familiar
laughed
hoarsely
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
of
Mother
Demdike
?
"
pursued
the
hag
.
"
<EOS>
Hast
thou
<EOS>
no
comfort
for
me
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
her
hour
is
likewise
come
,
and
I
will
forgive
thee
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
let
her
triumph
over
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
familiar
made
no
answer
,
but
,
laughing
derisively
,
stamped
upon
the
ground
,
and
it
opened
to
receive
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
!
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
in
the
mean
time
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
rouse
her
daughter
to
full
consciousness
,
"
fly
with
me
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
enemy
?
"
asked
Alizon
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
so
many
,
that
I
know
not
whom
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
the
worst
of
all
--
this
is
Mother
Demdike
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
take
your
life
.
<EOS>
If
we
can
but
conceal
ourselves
for
a
short
while
,
we
are
safe
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
too
weak
to
move
,
"
said
Alizon
;
"
besides
,
I
dare
not
trust
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
deceived
already
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
an
evil
spirit
in
the
likeness
of
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
,
I
am
indeed
your
own
--
own
mother
,
"
rejoined
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ask
this
old
woman
if
it
is
not
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
witch
herself
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
trust
either
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
both
in
league
with
Mother
Demdike
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
in
league
to
save
thee
from
her
,
foolish
wench
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mother
Chattox
,
"
but
thy
perverseness
will
defeat
all
our
schemes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
will
not
fly
,
my
child
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
kneel
down
,
and
pray
earnestly
for
deliverance
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
while
there
is
yet
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
a
growl
like
thunder
was
heard
in
the
air
,
and
the
earth
trembled
beneath
their
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
now
I
am
sure
you
are
my
mother
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
,
flinging
herself
into
Mistress
Nutter
's
arms
;
"
and
I
will
go
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
before
they
could
move
,
several
dusky
figures
were
seen
rushing
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
on
your
guard
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mother
Chattox
;
"
here
comes
old
Demdike
with
her
troop
.
<EOS>
I
will
aid
you
all
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Down
on
your
knees
!
"
exclaimed
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
obeyed
,
but
ere
a
word
could
pass
her
lips
,
the
infuriated
hag
,
attended
by
her
beldame
band
,
stood
beside
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
who
is
here
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
who
dares
interrupt
my
mystic
rites
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
raising
her
hand
,
the
black
cloud
hanging
over
the
hill
was
rent
asunder
,
and
the
moon
shone
down
upon
them
,
revealing
the
old
witch
,
armed
with
the
sacrificial
knife
,
her
limbs
shaking
with
fury
,
and
her
eyes
flashing
with
preternatural
light
.
<EOS>
It
revealed
,
also
,
her
weird
attendants
,
as
well
as
the
group
before
her
,
consisting
of
the
kneeling
figure
of
Alizon
,
protected
by
the
outstretched
arms
of
her
mother
,
and
further
defended
by
Mother
Chattox
,
who
planted
herself
in
front
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
eyed
the
group
for
a
moment
as
if
she
would
,
annihilate
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Out
of
my
way
,
Chattox
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
vociferated--"out
of
my
way
,
or
I
will
drive
my
knife
to
thy
heart
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
her
old
antagonist
maintained
her
ground
,
she
unhesitatingly
advanced
upon
her
,
smote
her
with
the
weapon
,
and
,
as
she
fell
to
the
ground
,
stepped
over
her
bleeding
body
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
what
dost
thou
here
,
Alice
Nutter
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
menacing
her
with
the
reeking
blade
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
for
my
child
,
whom
thou
hast
stolen
from
me
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
come
to
witness
her
slaughter
,
"
replied
the
witch
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Begone
,
or
I
will
serve
thee
as
I
have
just
served
old
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
sped
yet
,
"
cried
the
wounded
hag
;
"
I
shall
live
to
see
thee
bound
hand
and
foot
by
the
officers
of
justice
,
and
,
certain
thou
wilt
perish
miserably
,
I
shall
die
content
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Spit
out
thy
last
drops
of
venom
,
black
viper
,
"
rejoined
Mother
Demdike
;
"
when
I
have
done
with
the
others
,
I
will
return
and
finish
thee
.
<EOS>
Alice
Nutter
,
thou
knowest
it
is
vain
to
struggle
with
me
.
<EOS>
Give
me
up
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wilt
thou
accept
my
life
for
hers
?
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
what
account
would
thy
life
be
to
me
?
"
rejoined
Mother
Demdike
,
disdainfully
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
would
profit
me
to
take
it
,
I
would
do
so
without
thy
consent
,
but
I
am
about
to
make
an
oblation
to
our
master
,
and
thou
art
his
already
.
<EOS>
Snatch
her
child
from
her
--
we
waste
time
,
"
she
added
,
to
her
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
And
immediately
the
weird
crew
rushed
forward
,
and
in
spite
of
the
miserable
mother
's
efforts
tore
Alizon
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
it
was
in
vain
to
contend
with
me
,
"
said
Mother
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
I
could
call
down
heaven
's
vengeance
upon
thy
accursed
head
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
but
I
am
forsaken
alike
of
God
and
man
,
and
shall
die
despairing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rave
on
<EOS>
,
thou
wilt
have
ample
leisure
,
"
replied
the
hag
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
bring
the
girl
this
way
,
"
she
added
to
the
beldames
;
"
the
sacrifice
must
be
made
near
the
beacon
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
Alizon
was
borne
away
,
Mistress
Nutter
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
stay
here
,
"
said
Mother
Chattox
,
raising
herself
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
Go
after
her
;
you
may
yet
save
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
how
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
power
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
a
dusky
form
rose
up
beside
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
return
to
your
duty
if
I
help
you
in
this
extremity
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
do
,
do
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
Anything
to
avenge
yourself
upon
that
murtherous
hag
.
"
 
"
Peace
!
"
cried
the
familiar
,
spurning
her
with
his
cloven
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
vengeance
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
I
only
want
to
save
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
consent
on
that
condition
?
"
said
the
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
now
perceive
I
am
not
utterly
lost
,
since
you
try
to
regain
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
renounced
thy
master
,
and
will
make
no
new
bargain
with
him
.
<EOS>
Get
hence
,
tempter
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Think
not
to
escape
us
,
"
cried
the
familiar
;
"
no
penitence
--
no
absolution
can
save
thee
.
<EOS>
Thy
name
is
written
on
the
judgment
scroll
,
and
can
not
be
effaced
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
aided
thee
,
but
,
since
my
offer
is
rejected
,
I
leave
thee
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
let
him
go
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
that
the
chance
were
mine
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
silent
,
or
I
will
beat
thy
brains
out
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
familiar
.
<EOS>
"
Once
more
,
am
I
dismissed
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
for
ever
!
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
familiar
disappeared
,
she
flew
to
the
spot
where
her
child
had
been
taken
.
 
<EOS>
About
twenty
paces
from
the
beacon
,
a
circle
had
again
been
formed
by
the
unhallowed
crew
,
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
Mother
Demdike
,
with
the
gory
knife
in
her
hand
,
muttering
spells
and
incantations
,
and
performing
mystical
ceremonials
.
 
<EOS>
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
her
companions
joined
in
these
rites
,
and
chanted
a
song
couched
in
a
wild
,
unintelligible
jargon
.
<EOS>
Beside
the
witch
knelt
Alizon
,
with
her
hands
tied
behind
her
back
,
so
that
she
could
not
raise
them
in
supplication
;
her
hair
unbound
,
and
cast
loosely
over
her
person
,
and
a
thick
bandage
fastened
over
her
eyes
and
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
The
initiatory
ceremonies
over
<EOS>
,
the
old
hag
approached
her
victim
,
when
Mistress
Nutter
forced
herself
through
the
circle
,
and
cast
herself
at
her
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spare
her
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
clinging
to
her
knees
;
"
it
shall
be
well
for
thee
if
thou
dost
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Again
interrupted
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
witch
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
time
I
will
show
thee
no
mercy
.
<EOS>
Take
thy
fate
,
meddlesome
woman
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
raised
the
knife
,
but
ere
the
weapon
could
descend
<EOS>
,
it
was
seized
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
wrested
from
her
grasp
.
<EOS>
In
another
instant
,
Alizon
's
arms
were
liberated
,
and
the
bandage
removed
from
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
it
is
my
turn
to
threaten
.
<EOS>
I
have
thee
in
my
power
,
infernal
hag
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
holding
the
knife
to
the
witch
's
throat
,
and
clasping
her
daughter
with
the
other
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wilt
let
us
go
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
replied
Mother
Demdike
,
springing
nimbly
backwards
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
both
die
.
<EOS>
I
will
soon
disarm
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
making
one
or
two
passes
with
her
hands
,
Mistress
Nutter
dropped
the
weapon
,
and
instantly
became
fixed
and
motionless
,
with
her
daughter
,
equally
rigid
,
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
They
looked
as
if
suddenly
turned
to
marble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
to
complete
the
ceremonial
,
"
cried
Mother
Demdike
,
picking
up
the
knife
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
she
began
to
mutter
an
impious
address
preparatory
to
the
sacrifice
,
when
a
loud
clangour
was
heard
like
the
stroke
of
a
hammer
upon
a
bell
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
was
that
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
witch
,
in
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
there
a
clock
here
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
it
had
struck
one
,
"
replied
Mould
-
heels
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
our
master
's
timepiece
,
"
said
another
witch
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
o'clock
!
"
exclaimed
Mother
Demdike
,
who
appeared
stupefied
with
fear
,
"
and
the
sacrifice
not
made
--
then
I
am
lost
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
derisive
laugh
reached
her
ears
.
<EOS>
It
proceeded
from
Mother
Chattox
,
who
had
contrived
to
raise
herself
to
her
feet
,
and
,
tottering
forward
,
now
passed
through
the
appalled
circle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
thy
term
is
out
--
<EOS>
thy
soul
is
forfeited
like
mine
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
fell
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
may
not
be
too
late
,
"
cried
Mother
Demdike
,
grasping
the
knife
,
and
rushing
towards
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
this
moment
a
bright
flame
shot
up
from
the
beacon
.
 
<EOS>
Astonishment
and
terror
seized
the
hag
,
and
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
which
was
echoed
by
the
rest
of
the
crew
.
 
<EOS>
The
flame
mounted
higher
and
higher
,
and
burnt
each
moment
more
brightly
,
illumining
the
whole
summit
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
By
its
light
could
be
seen
a
band
of
men
,
some
of
whom
were
on
horseback
,
speeding
towards
the
place
of
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Scared
by
the
sight
,
the
witches
fled
,
but
were
turned
by
another
band
advancing
from
the
opposite
quarter
.
<EOS>
They
then
made
towards
the
spot
where
their
broomsticks
were
deposited
,
but
ere
they
could
reach
it
,
a
third
party
gained
the
summit
of
the
hill
at
this
precise
point
,
and
immediately
started
in
pursuit
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
a
young
man
issuing
from
behind
the
beacon
,
flew
towards
Mistress
Nutter
and
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
moment
the
flame
burst
forth
,
the
spell
cast
over
them
by
Mother
Demdike
was
broken
,
and
motion
and
speech
restored
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
!
"
exclaimed
the
young
man
,
as
he
came
up
<EOS>
,
"
your
trials
are
over
.
<EOS>
You
are
safe
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Richard
!
"
she
replied
,
falling
into
his
arms
,
"
have
we
been
preserved
by
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
mere
instrument
in
the
hands
of
Heaven
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
made
no
attempt
at
flight
with
the
rest
of
the
witches
,
but
remained
for
a
few
moments
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
flaming
beacon
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
still
grasped
the
murderous
weapon
she
had
raised
against
Alizon
,
but
it
had
dropped
to
her
side
when
the
fire
burst
forth
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
turned
fiercely
to
Richard
,
and
demanded--
 
<EOS>
"
Was
it
thou
who
kindled
the
beacon
?
"
 
"
It
was
!
"
replied
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
bade
thee
do
it
--
who
brought
thee
hither
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
the
witch
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
enemy
of
thine
,
old
woman
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Richard
,
"
His
vengeance
has
been
slow
in
coming
,
but
it
has
arrived
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
who
is
he
?
<EOS>
I
see
him
not
!
"
rejoined
Mother
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
him
before
yon
flame
expires
,
"
said
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
come
to
your
assistance
sooner
,
Alizon
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
her
,
"
but
I
was
forbidden
.
<EOS>
And
I
knew
I
should
best
ensure
your
safety
by
compliance
with
the
injunctions
I
had
received
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Some
guardian
spirit
must
have
interposed
to
preserve
us
,
"
replied
Alizon
;
"
for
such
only
could
have
successfully
combated
with
the
evil
beings
from
whom
we
have
been
delivered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
spirit
is
unable
to
preserve
thee
now
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mother
Demdike
,
aiming
a
deadly
blow
at
her
with
the
knife
.
<EOS>
But
,
fortunately
,
the
attempt
was
foreseen
by
Richard
,
who
caught
her
arm
,
and
wrested
the
weapon
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Curses
on
thee
,
Richard
Assheton
!
"
cried
the
infuriated
hag,--"and
on
thee
too
,
Alizon
Device
,
I
can
not
work
ye
<EOS>
the
immediate
ill
I
wish
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
ye
loathsome
in
one
another
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
maim
your
limbs
,
or
blight
your
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
deliver
you
over
to
devilish
possession
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
bequeath
you
a
legacy
of
hate
.
<EOS>
What
I
say
will
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Thou
,
Alizon
,
wilt
never
we
d
Richard
Assheton
--
never
!
<EOS>
Vainly
shall
ye
struggle
with
your
destiny
--
vainly
indulge
hopes
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
Misery
and
despair
,
and
an
early
grave
,
are
in
store
for
both
of
you
.
<EOS>
He
shall
be
to
you
your
worst
enemy
,
and
you
shall
be
to
him
destruction
.
<EOS>
Think
of
the
witch
's
prediction
and
tremble
,
and
may
her
deadliest
curse
rest
upon
your
heads
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Richard
!
"
exclaimed
Alizon
,
who
would
have
sunk
to
the
ground
if
he
had
not
sustained
her
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
prevent
this
terrible
malediction
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
could
not
,
"
replied
Mother
Demdike
,
with
a
laugh
of
exultation
;
"
it
shall
work
,
and
thy
doom
shall
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
And
now
to
make
an
end
of
old
Chattox
,
and
then
they
may
take
me
where
they
please
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
was
approaching
her
old
enemy
with
the
intention
of
putting
her
threat
into
execution
,
when
James
Device
,
who
appeared
to
start
from
the
ground
,
rushed
swiftly
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
art
thou
doing
here
,
Jem
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
hag
,
regarding
him
with
angry
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dost
thou
not
see
we
are
surrounded
by
enemies
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
escape
them
--
but
thou
art
young
and
active
.
<EOS>
Away
with
thee
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
without
yo
,
granny
,
"
replied
Jem
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ey
ha
'
run
os
<EOS>
fast
os
<EOS>
ey
could
to
help
yo
.
<EOS>
Stick
fast
howld
on
me
,
"
he
added
,
snatching
her
up
in
his
arms
,
"
an
ey'n
bring
yo
clear
off
yet
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
set
off
at
a
rapid
pace
with
his
burthen
,
<EOS>
Richard
being
too
much
occupied
with
Alizon
to
oppose
him
.

CHAPTER
XVII.--HOW
<EOS>
THE
BEACON
FIRE
WAS
EXTINGUISHED
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
Nicholas
Assheton
,
attended
by
two
or
three
men
,
came
up
,
and
asked
whither
the
old
witch
had
flown
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
pointed
out
the
course
taken
by
the
fugitive
,
who
had
run
towards
the
northern
extremity
of
the
hill
,
down
the
sides
of
which
he
had
already
plunged
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
carried
off
by
her
grandson
,
Jem
Device
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
be
quick
,
or
you
will
lose
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
be
quick
--
be
quick
!
"
<EOS>
added
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yonder
they
went
,
to
the
back
of
the
beacon
.
"
 
<EOS>
Casting
a
look
at
the
wretched
speaker
,
and
finding
she
was
too
grievously
wounded
to
be
able
to
move
,
Nicholas
bestowed
no
further
thought
upon
her
,
but
set
off
with
his
companions
in
the
direction
pointed
out
.
<EOS>
He
speedily
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
hill
,
and
,
looking
down
it
,
sought
in
vain
for
any
appearance
of
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
The
sides
were
here
steep
and
shelving
,
and
some
hundred
yards
lower
down
were
broken
into
ridges
,
behind
one
of
which
it
was
possible
the
old
witch
and
her
grandson
might
be
concealed
;
so
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
the
squire
descended
,
and
began
to
search
about
in
the
hollows
,
scrambling
over
the
loose
stones
,
or
sliding
down
for
some
paces
with
the
uncertain
boggy
soil
,
when
he
fancied
he
heard
a
plaintive
cry
.
<EOS>
He
looked
around
,
but
could
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
The
whole
side
of
the
mountain
was
lighted
up
by
the
fire
from
the
beacon
,
which
,
instead
of
diminishing
,
burnt
with
increased
ardour
,
so
that
every
object
was
as
easily
to
be
discerned
as
in
the
day
-
time
;
but
,
notwithstanding
this
,
he
could
not
detect
whence
the
sound
proceeded
.
<EOS>
It
was
repeated
,
but
more
faintly
than
before
,
and
Nicholas
almost
persuaded
himself
it
was
the
voice
of
Potts
calling
for
help
.
<EOS>
Motioning
to
his
followers
,
who
were
engaged
in
the
search
like
himself
,
to
keep
still
,
the
squire
listened
intently
,
and
again
caught
the
sound
,
being
this
time
convinced
it
arose
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
the
unfortunate
attorney
had
been
buried
alive
?
<EOS>
Or
had
he
been
thrust
into
some
hole
,
and
a
stone
placed
over
it
,
which
he
found
it
impossible
to
remove
?
<EOS>
The
latter
idea
seemed
the
more
probable
,
and
Nicholas
was
guided
by
a
feeble
repetition
of
the
noise
towards
a
large
fragment
of
rock
,
which
,
on
examination
,
had
evidently
been
rolled
from
a
point
immediately
over
the
mouth
of
a
hollow
.
<EOS>
The
squire
instantly
set
himself
to
work
to
dislodge
the
ponderous
stone
,
and
,
aided
by
two
of
his
men
,
who
lent
their
broad
shoulders
to
the
task
,
quickly
accomplished
his
object
,
disclosing
what
appeared
to
be
the
mouth
of
a
cavernous
recess
.
<EOS>
From
out
of
this
,
as
soon
as
the
stone
was
removed
,
popped
the
head
of
Master
Potts
,
and
Nicholas
,
bidding
him
be
of
good
cheer
,
laid
hold
of
him
to
draw
him
forth
,
as
he
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
in
extricating
himself
,
when
the
attorney
cried
out--
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
pull
so
hard
,
squire
!
<EOS>
That
accursed
Jem
Device
has
got
hold
of
my
legs
.
<EOS>
Not
so
hard
,
sir
,
I
entreat
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bid
him
let
go
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
unable
to
refrain
from
laughing
,
"
or
we
will
unearth
him
from
his
badger
's
hole
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
pays
no
heed
to
what
I
say
to
him
,
"
cried
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
he
is
dragging
me
down
again
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
spoke
,
the
attorney
,
notwithstanding
all
Nicholas
's
efforts
to
restrain
him
,
was
pulled
down
into
the
hole
.
<EOS>
The
squire
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
,
and
was
considering
whether
he
should
resort
to
the
tedious
process
of
digging
him
out
,
when
a
scrambling
noise
was
heard
,
and
the
captive
's
head
once
more
appeared
above
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
coming
out
now
?
"
asked
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
,
no
!
"
replied
the
attorney
,
"
unless
you
will
make
terms
with
the
rascal
.
<EOS>
He
declares
he
will
strangle
me
,
if
you
do
not
promise
to
set
him
and
his
grandmother
free
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
Mother
Demdike
with
him
?
"
asked
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
replied
Potts
;
"
and
we
are
as
badly
off
for
room
as
three
foxes
in
a
hole
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
is
no
other
outlet
said
the
squire
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
conclude
not
,
"
replied
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
I
groped
about
like
a
mole
when
I
was
first
thrust
into
the
cavern
by
Jem
Device
,
but
I
could
find
no
means
of
exit
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
was
blocked
up
by
the
great
stone
which
you
had
some
difficulty
in
moving
,
but
which
Jem
could
shift
at
will
;
for
he
pushed
it
aside
in
a
moment
,
and
brought
it
back
to
its
place
,
when
he
returned
just
now
with
the
old
hag
;
but
probably
that
was
effected
by
witchcraft
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
likely
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
"
<EOS>
But
for
your
being
in
it
,
we
would
stop
up
this
hole
,
and
bury
the
two
wretches
alive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Get
me
out
first
,
good
Master
Nicholas
,
I
implore
of
you
,
and
then
do
what
you
please
,
"
cried
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
Jem
is
tugging
at
my
legs
as
if
he
would
pull
them
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
try
who
is
strongest
,
"
said
Nicholas
,
again
seizing
hold
of
Potts
by
the
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
it
--
let
go
!
"
shrieked
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
stretched
to
twice
my
natural
length
.
<EOS>
My
joints
are
starting
from
their
sockets
,
my
legs
are
coming
off
--
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lend
a
hand
here
,
one
of
you
,
"
cried
Nicholas
to
the
men
;
"
we
'll
have
him
out
,
whatever
be
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
wo
n't
come
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
right
to
use
me
thus
.
<EOS>
Torture
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
loins
are
ruptured
--
my
back
is
breaking
--
I
am
a
dead
man.--The
hag
has
got
hold
of
my
right
leg
,
while
Jem
is
tugging
with
all
his
force
at
the
left
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pull
away
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
;
"
he
is
coming
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
legs
are
off
,
"
yelled
Potts
,
as
he
was
plucked
suddenly
forth
,
with
a
jerk
that
threw
the
squire
and
his
assistants
on
their
backs
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
able
to
walk
more
.
<EOS>
No
,
Heaven
be
praised
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
looking
down
on
his
lower
limbs
,
"
I
have
only
lost
my
boots
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
it
,
then
,
"
cried
Nicholas
;
"
but
thank
your
stars
<EOS>
you
are
above
ground
once
more
.
<EOS>
Hark'ee
,
Jem
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
shouting
down
the
hole
;
"
If
you
do
n't
come
forth
at
once
,
and
bring
Mother
Demdike
with
you
,
we
'll
close
up
the
mouth
of
this
hole
in
such
a
way
that
you
sha'n't
require
another
grave
.
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yeigh
,
"
replied
Jem
,
his
voice
coming
hoarsely
and
hollowly
up
like
the
accents
of
a
ghost
.
"
<EOS>
Am
ey
to
go
free
if
ey
comply
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
choice
between
this
hole
and
the
hangman
's
cord
at
Lancaster
,
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
In
either
case
you
will
die
by
suffocation
.
<EOS>
But
be
quick
--
we
have
wasted
time
enough
already
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
if
that
's
aw
<EOS>
yo'll
do
<EOS>
fo
<EOS>
'
me
,
squire
,
eyn
e'en

"
rejoined
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
my
man
,
stop
up
this
hole
with
earth
and
stones
.
<EOS>
Master
Potts
,
you
will
lend
a
hand
to
the
task
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Readily
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
attorney
,
"
though
I
shall
lose
the
pleasure
I
had
anticipated
of
seeing
that
old
carrion
crow
roasted
alive
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
a
bit
,
squoire
,
"
roared
Jem
,
as
preparations
were
actively
made
for
carrying
Nicholas
's
orders
into
execution
.
"
<EOS>
Stay
a
bit
,
an
ey'n
cum
owt
,
an
bring
t
'
owd
woman
wi
'
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
'd
change
your
mind
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
laughing
.
"
<EOS>
Be
upon
your
guard
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
low
tone
to
the
others
,
"
and
seize
him
the
moment
he
appears
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Jem
evidently
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
perform
his
promise
,
for
stifled
shrieks
and
other
noises
<EOS>
proclaimed
that
a
desperate
struggle
was
going
on
between
him
and
his
grandmother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
exclaimed
Nicholas
,
placing
his
ear
to
the
hole
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
old
hag
is
unwilling
to
come
forth
,
and
spits
and
scratches
like
a
cat
-
a
-
mountain
,
while
Jem
gripes
her
like
a
terrier
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
hard
tussle
between
them
,
but
he
is
getting
the
better
of
it
,
and
is
pushing
her
forth
.
<EOS>
Now
look
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
Mother
Demdike
's
terrible
head
protruded
from
the
ground
,
and
,
despite
of
the
execrations
she
poured
forth
upon
her
enemies
,
she
was
instantly
seized
by
them
,
drawn
out
of
the
cavern
,
and
secured
.
<EOS>
While
the
men
were
thus
engaged
,
and
while
Nicholas
's
attention
was
for
an
instant
diverted
,
Jem
bounded
forth
as
suddenly
as
a
wolf
from
his
lair
,
and
,
dashing
aside
all
opposition
,
plunged
down
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
to
pursue
him
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
escape
.
<EOS>
The
whole
country
will
be
roused
by
the
beacon
fire
,
and
hue
and
cry
shall
be
made
after
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Right
!
"
exclaimed
Potts
;
"
and
now
let
some
one
creep
into
that
cavern
,
and
bring
out
my
boots
,
and
then
I
shall
be
in
a
better
condition
to
attend
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
request
being
complied
with
,
and
the
attorney
being
once
more
equipped
for
walking
,
the
party
climbed
the
hill
-
side
,
and
,
bringing
Mother
Demdike
with
them
,
shaped
their
course
towards
the
beacon
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
to
see
what
had
taken
place
in
the
interim
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
squire
quitted
Mistress
Nutter
than
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
rode
up
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
loiter
here
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
stern
tone
,
somewhat
tempered
by
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
held
back
to
give
you
an
opportunity
of
escape
.
<EOS>
The
hill
is
invested
by
your
enemies
.
<EOS>
On
that
side
Roger
Nowell
is
advancing
,
and
on
this
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
and
his
followers
.
<EOS>
You
may
possibly
effect
a
retreat
in
the
opposite
direction
,
but
not
a
moment
must
be
lost
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
with
you
,
"
said
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
interposed
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
strength
for
the
effort
,
and
will
only
retard
her
.
"

"
I
thank
you
for
your
devotion
,
my
child
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
a
look
of
grateful
tenderness
;
"
but
it
is
unneeded
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
intention
of
flying
.
<EOS>
I
shall
surrender
myself
into
the
hands
of
justice
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
mistake
the
matter
,
madam
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
,
"
and
delude
yourself
with
the
notion
that
either
your
rank
or
wealth
will
screen
you
from
punishment
.
<EOS>
Your
guilt
is
too
clearly
established
to
allow
you
a
chance
of
escape
,
and
,
though
I
myself
am
acting
wrongfully
in
counselling
flight
to
you
,
I
am
led
to
do
so
from
the
friendship
once
subsisting
between
us
,
and
the
relationship
which
,
unfortunately
,
I
can
not
destroy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
you
who
are
mistaken
,
not
I
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
thought
of
turning
aside
the
sword
of
justice
,
but
shall
court
its
sharpest
edge
,
hoping
by
a
full
avowal
of
my
offences
,
in
some
degree
to
atone
for
them
.
<EOS>
My
only
regret
is
,
that
I
shall
leave
my
child
unprotected
,
and
that
my
fate
will
bring
dishonour
upon
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
think
not
of
me
,
dear
mother
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
,
"
but
persist
unhesitatingly
in
the
course
you
have
laid
down
.
<EOS>
Far
rather
would
I
see
you
act
thus
--
far
rather
hear
the
sentiments
you
have
uttered
,
even
though
they
may
be
attended
by
the
saddest
,
consequences
,
than
behold
you
in
your
former
proud
position
,
and
impenitent
.
<EOS>
Think
not
of
me
,
then
.
<EOS>
Or
,
rather
,
think
only
how
I
rejoice
that
your
eyes
are
at
length
opened
,
and
that
you
have
cast
off
the
bonds
of
iniquity
.
<EOS>
I
can
now
pray
for
you
with
the
full
hope
that
my
intercessions
will
prevail
,
and
in
parting
with
you
in
this
world
shall
be
sustained
by
the
conviction
that
we
shall
meet
in
eternal
happiness
hereafter
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
threw
her
arms
about
her
daughter
's
neck
,
and
they
mingled
their
tears
together
,
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
was
much
moved
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
she
should
fall
into
their
hands
,
"
he
observed
to
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
to
advise
,
"
replied
the
latter
,
greatly
troubled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
is
too
late
,
"
exclaimed
the
knight
;
"
here
come
Nowell
and
Metcalfe
.
<EOS>
The
poor
lady
's
firmness
will
be
severely
tested
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
the
magistrate
and
the
knight
came
up
,
with
such
of
their
attendants
as
were
not
engaged
in
pursuing
the
witches
,
several
of
whom
had
already
been
captured
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Mistress
Nutter
,
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
sprang
from
his
horse
,
and
would
have
seized
her
,
but
Sir
Ralph
interposed
,
saying
"
She
has
surrendered
herself
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
answerable
for
her
safe
custody
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
pardon
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
observed
Nowell
;
"
the
arrest
must
be
formally
made
,
and
by
a
constable
.
<EOS>
Sparshot
,
execute
your
warrant
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
official
,
leaping
from
his
horse
,
displayed
his
staff
and
a
piece
of
parchment
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
telling
her
she
was
his
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
bowed
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shan
<EOS>
ey
tee
her
hands
,
yer
warship
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
constable
of
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
,
fellow
,
"
interposed
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
no
indignity
offered
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
said
I
will
be
responsible
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
recollect
she
is
arrested
for
witchcraft
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
observed
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
shall
answer
to
the
charges
brought
against
her
.
<EOS>
I
pledge
myself
to
that
,
"
replied
Sir
Ralph
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
by
a
full
confession
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
pledge
yourself
to
that
also
,
Sir
Ralph
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
avows
her
guilt
,
"
cried
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
I
take
you
all
to
witness
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
forget
it
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
--
nor
I
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sparshot
,
and
two
or
three
others
of
the
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
girl
is
my
prisoner
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
,
dismounting
,
and
advancing
towards
Alizon
,
"
She
is
a
witch
,
as
well
as
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
,
"
cried
Richard
!
"
<EOS>
and
if
you
attempt
to
lay
hands
upon
her
I
will
strike
you
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sdeath
!
"
exclaimed
Metcalfe
,
drawing
his
sword
,
"
I
will
not
let
this
insolence
pass
unpunished
.
<EOS>
I
have
other
affronts
to
chastise
.
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
or
I
will
cut
your
throat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
cried
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Settle
your
quarrels
hereafter
,
if
you
have
any
to
adjust
;
but
I
will
have
no
fighting
now
.
<EOS>
Alizon
is
no
witch
.
<EOS>
You
are
well
aware
that
she
was
about
to
be
impiously
and
cruelly
sacrificed
by
Mother
Demdike
,
and
her
rescue
was
the
main
object
of
our
coming
hither
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Still
suspicion
attaches
to
her
,
"
said
Metcalfe
;
"
whether
she
be
the
daughter
of
Elizabeth
Device
or
Alice
Nutter
,
she
comes
of
a
bad
stock
,
and
I
protest
against
her
being
allowed
to
go
free
.
<EOS>
However
,
if
you
are
resolved
upon
it
,
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
shall
find
other
time
and
place
to
adjust
my
differences
with
Master
Richard
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
please
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
young
man
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
will
answer
for
the
propriety
of
the
course
I
have
pursued
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
;
"
but
here
comes
Nicholas
with
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Demdike
taken
!
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
cried
Mother
Chattox
,
slightly
raising
herself
as
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
Kill
her
,
or
she
will
'
scape
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
When
Nicholas
came
up
with
the
old
hag
,
both
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
and
Roger
Nowell
put
several
questions
to
her
,
but
she
refused
to
answer
their
interrogations
;
and
,
horrified
by
her
blasphemies
and
imprecations
,
they
caused
her
to
be
removed
to
a
short
distance
,
while
a
consultation
was
held
as
to
the
course
to
be
pursued
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
made
half
a
dozen
of
these
miscreants
prisoners
,
"
said
Roger
Nowell
,
"
and
the
whole
of
them
had
better
be
taken
to
Whalley
,
where
they
can
be
safely
confined
in
the
old
dungeons
of
the
Abbey
,
and
after
their
examination
on
the
morrow
can
be
removed
to
Lancaster
Castle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
replied
Sir
Ralph
;
"
but
must
yon
unfortunate
lady
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
be
taken
with
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
,
"
replied
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
make
no
distinction
among
such
offenders
;
or
,
if
there
are
any
degrees
in
guilt
,
hers
is
of
the
highest
class
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
take
leave
of
your
daughter
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
to
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
the
hint
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
dear
Alizon
,
"
she
added
,
straining
her
to
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
part
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Once
more
before
I
quit
this
world
,
in
which
I
have
played
so
wicked
a
part
,
I
would
fain
look
upon
you
--
<EOS>
fain
bless
you
,
if
I
have
the
power
--
but
this
must
be
at
the
last
,
when
my
trials
are
wellnigh
over
,
and
when
all
is
about
to
close
upon
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
must
it
be
thus
?
"
exclaimed
Alizon
,
in
a
voice
half
suffocated
by
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
,
"
replied
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
attempt
to
shake
my
resolution
,
my
sweet
child
--
do
not
weep
for
me
.
<EOS>
Amidst
all
the
terrors
that
surround
me
,
I
am
happier
now
than
I
have
been
for
years
.
<EOS>
I
shall
strive
to
work
out
my
redemption
by
prayers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
succeed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
!
"
shrieked
Mother
Demdike
;
"
the
Fiend
will
have
his
own
.
<EOS>
She
is
bound
to
him
by
a
compact
which
nought
can
annul
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
the
instrument
,
"
said
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
I
might
give
a
legal
opinion
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
might
be
avoided
;
and
in
any
case
its
production
in
court
would
have
an
admirable
effect
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
the
counsel
examining
it
,
and
hear
the
judges
calling
for
it
to
be
placed
before
them
.
<EOS>
His
infernal
Majesty
's
signature
must
be
a
curiosity
in
its
way
.
<EOS>
Our
gracious
and
sagacious
monarch
would
delight
in
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
exclaimed
Nicholas
;
"
and
take
care
,
"
he
cried
,
"
that
no
further
interruptions
are
offered
by
that
infernal
hag
.
<EOS>
Have
you
done
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
still
remained
with
her
daughter
folded
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
happiness
I
have
thrown
away
!
<EOS>
What
anguish
--
what
remorse
brought
upon
myself
by
the
evil
life
I
have
led
!
<EOS>
As
I
gaze
on
this
fair
face
,
and
think
it
might
long
,
long
have
brightened
my
dark
and
desolate
life
with
its
sunshine
--
as
I
think
upon
all
this
,
my
fortitude
wellnigh
deserts
me
,
and
I
have
need
of
support
from
on
high
to
carry
me
through
my
trial
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
it
will
be
denied
me
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
Assheton
,
you
have
the
deed
of
the
gift
of
Rough
Lee
in
your
possession
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
Alizon
is
mistress
of
the
mansion
and
domains
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Provided
always
they
are
not
forfeited
to
the
crown
,
which
I
apprehend
will
be
the
case
,
"
suggested
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
she
is
put
in
possession
of
them
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
to
you
,
Richard
,
"
continued
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
the
time
may
come
when
your
devotion
to
my
daughter
may
be
rewarded
and
I
could
not
bestow
a
greater
boon
upon
you
than
by
giving
you
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
well
I
should
give
my
consent
now
,
and
,
if
no
other
obstacle
should
arise
to
the
union
,
may
she
be
yours
,
and
happiness
I
am
sure
will
attend
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Overpowered
by
conflicting
emotions
,
Alizon
hid
her
face
in
her
mother
's
bosom
,
and
Richard
,
who
was
almost
equally
overcome
,
was
about
to
reply
,
when
Mother
Demdike
broke
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
will
never
be
united
!
"
she
screamed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
!
<EOS>
I
have
said
it
,
and
my
words
will
come
true
.
<EOS>
Think'st
thou
<EOS>
a
witch
like
thee
can
bless
an
union
,
Alice
Nutter
?
<EOS>
Thy
<EOS>
blessings
are
curses
,
thy
wishes
disappointments
and
despair
.
<EOS>
Thriftless
love
shall
be
Alizon
's
,
and
the
grave
shall
be
her
bridal
bed
.
<EOS>
The
witch
's
daughter
shall
share
the
witch
's
fate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
These
boding
words
produced
a
terrible
effect
upon
the
hearers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
her
not
,
my
sweet
child
<EOS>
--
she
speaks
falsely
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
endeavouring
to
re
-
assure
her
daughter
;
but
the
tone
in
which
the
words
were
uttered
showed
that
she
herself
was
greatly
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
cursed
them
both
,
and
I
will
curse
them
again
,
"
yelled
Mother
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Away
with
the
old
screech
-
owl
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
Take
her
to
the
beacon
,
and
,
if
she
continues
troublesome
,
hurl
her
into
the
flame
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
notwithstanding
the
hag
's
struggles
and
imprecations
,
she
was
removed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whatever
may
betide
,
Alizon
,
"
cried
Richard
,
"
my
life
shall
be
devoted
to
you
;
and
,
if
you
should
not
be
mine
,
I
will
have
no
other
bride
.
<EOS>
With
your
permission
,
madam
,
"
he
added
,
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
I
will
take
your
daughter
to
Middleton
,
where
she
will
find
companionship
and
solace
,
I
trust
,
in
the
attentions
of
my
sister
,
who
has
the
strongest
affection
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
wish
nothing
better
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
"
and
now
to
put
an
end
to
this
harrowing
scene
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
Take
her
,
Richard
,
take
her
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
as
she
disengaged
herself
from
the
relaxing
embrace
of
her
daughter
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Master
Nowell
,
I
am
ready
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
join
the
other
prisoners
,
and
we
will
set
forth
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
at
this
juncture
a
terrific
shriek
was
heard
,
which
drew
all
eyes
towards
the
beacon
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mother
Demdike
had
been
removed
,
in
accordance
with
the
squire
's
directions
,
her
conduct
became
more
violent
and
outrageous
than
ever
,
and
those
who
had
charge
of
her
threatened
,
if
she
did
not
desist
,
to
carry
out
the
full
instructions
they
had
received
,
and
cast
her
into
the
flames
.
<EOS>
The
old
hag
defied
and
incensed
them
to
such
a
degree
by
her
violence
and
blasphemies
,
that
they
carried
her
to
the
very
edge
of
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
figure
of
a
monk
,
in
mouldering
white
habiliments
,
came
from
behind
the
beacon
,
and
stood
beside
the
old
hag
.
<EOS>
He
slowly
raised
his
hood
,
and
disclosed
features
that
looked
like
those
of
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
hour
is
come
,
accursed
woman
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
phantom
,
in
thrilling
accents
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thy
term
on
earth
is
ended
,
and
thou
shalt
be
delivered
to
unquenchable
fire
.
<EOS>
The
curse
of
Paslew
is
fulfilled
upon
thee
,
and
will
be
fulfilled
upon
all
thy
viperous
brood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Art
thou
the
abbot
's
shade
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
hag
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
thy
implacable
enemy
,
"
replied
the
phantom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thy
judgment
and
thy
punishment
are
committed
to
me
.
<EOS>
To
the
flames
with
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
awe
inspired
by
the
monk
,
and
such
the
authority
of
his
tones
and
gesture
,
that
the
command
was
unhesitatingly
obeyed
,
and
the
witch
was
cast
,
shrieking
,
into
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
instantly
swallowed
up
as
in
a
gulf
of
flame
,
which
raged
,
and
roared
,
and
shot
up
in
a
hundred
lambent
points
,
as
if
exulting
in
its
prey
.
 
<EOS>
The
wretched
creature
was
seen
for
a
moment
to
rise
up
in
it
in
extremity
of
anguish
,
with
arms
extended
,
and
uttering
a
dreadful
yell
,
but
the
flames
wreathed
round
her
,
and
she
sank
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
When
those
who
had
assisted
at
this
fearful
execution
looked
around
for
the
mysterious
being
who
had
commanded
it
,
they
could
nowhere
behold
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
was
heard
a
laugh
of
gratified
hate
--
such
a
laugh
as
only
a
demon
,
or
one
bound
to
a
demon
,
can
utter
--
and
the
appalled
listeners
looked
around
,
and
beheld
Mother
Chattox
standing
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
rival
is
gone
!
"
cried
the
hag
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
the
last
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
burnt
--
ah
!
ah
!
"
 
<EOS>
Further
triumph
was
not
allowed
her
.
<EOS>
With
one
accord
,
and
as
if
prompted
by
an
irresistible
impulse
,
the
men
rushed
upon
her
,
seized
her
,
and
cast
her
into
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Her
wild
laughter
was
heard
for
a
moment
above
the
roaring
of
the
flames
,
and
then
ceased
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
flame
shot
high
in
air
<EOS>
,
again
roared
and
raged
,
again
broke
into
a
multitude
of
lambent
points
,
after
which
it
suddenly
expired
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
darkness
on
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
silence
and
in
gloom
scarcely
more
profound
than
that
Weighing
in
every
breast
,
the
melancholy
troop
pursued
its
way
to
Whalley
.

CHAPTER
I.--DOWNHAM
MANOR
-
HOUSE
.
  
<EOS>
On
a
lovely
morning
,
about
the
middle
of
July
,
in
the
same
year
as
the
events
previously
narrated
,
Nicholas
Assheton
,
always
astir
with
the
lark
,
issued
from
his
own
dwelling
,
and
sauntered
across
the
smooth
lawn
in
front
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
green
eminence
on
which
he
stood
was
sheltered
on
the
right
by
a
grove
of
sycamores
,
forming
the
boundary
of
the
park
,
and
sloped
down
into
a
valley
threaded
by
a
small
clear
stream
,
whose
murmuring
,
as
it
danced
over
its
pebbly
bed
,
distinctly
reached
his
ear
in
the
stillness
of
early
day
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
,
partly
in
the
valley
,
and
partly
on
the
side
of
the
acclivity
on
which
the
hall
was
situated
,
nestled
the
little
village
whose
inhabitants
owned
Nicholas
as
lord
;
and
,
to
judge
from
their
habitations
,
they
had
reason
to
rejoice
in
their
master
;
for
certainly
there
was
a
cheerful
air
about
Downham
which
the
neighbouring
hamlets
,
especially
those
in
Pendle
Forest
,
sadly
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
left
of
the
mansion
,
and
only
separated
from
it
by
the
garden
walls
,
stood
the
church
,
a
venerable
structure
,
dating
back
to
a
period
more
remote
even
than
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
From
the
churchyard
a
view
,
almost
similar
to
that
enjoyed
by
the
squire
,
was
obtained
,
though
partially
interrupted
by
the
thick
rounded
foliage
of
a
large
tree
growing
beneath
it
;
and
many
a
traveller
who
came
that
way
lingered
within
the
hallowed
precincts
to
contemplate
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
a
small
stone
bridge
crossing
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
Across
the
road
,
and
scarce
thirty
paces
from
the
church
-
gate
,
stood
a
little
alehouse
,
whose
comfortable
fireside
nook
and
good
liquors
were
not
disdained
by
the
squire
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
to
his
shame
be
it
spoken
,
he
was
quite
as
often
to
be
found
there
of
an
evening
as
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
This
had
more
particularly
been
the
case
since
the
house
was
tenanted
by
Richard
Baldwyn
,
who
having
given
up
the
mill
at
Rough
Lee
,
and
taken
to
wife
Bess
Whitaker
of
Goldshaw
Booth
,
had
removed
with
her
to
Downham
,
where
he
now
flourished
under
the
special
protection
of
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Bess
had
lost
none
of
her
old
habits
of
command
,
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
poor
Richard
played
a
very
secondary
part
in
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
was
permitted
considerable
licence
by
her
,
but
even
he
had
limits
,
which
she
took
good
care
he
should
not
exceed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Downham
domains
were
well
cultivated
;
the
line
of
demarcation
between
them
and
the
heathy
wastes
adjoining
,
being
clearly
traced
out
,
and
you
had
only
to
follow
the
course
of
the
brook
to
see
at
a
glance
where
the
purlieus
of
the
forest
ended
,
and
where
Nicholas
Assheton
's
property
commenced
:
the
one
being
a
dreary
moor
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
thicket
upon
it
,
but
more
frequently
a
dangerous
morass
,
covered
with
sulphur
-
coloured
moss
;
and
the
other
consisting
of
green
meadows
,
bordered
in
most
instances
by
magnificent
timber
.
<EOS>
The
contrast
,
however
,
was
not
without
its
charm
;
and
while
the
sterile
wastes
set
off
the
fair
and
fertile
fields
around
them
,
and
enhanced
their
beauty
,
they
offered
a
wide
,
uninterrupted
expanse
,
over
which
the
eye
could
range
at
will
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
further
side
of
the
valley
,
and
immediately
opposite
the
lawn
whereon
<EOS>
Nicholas
stood
,
the
ground
gradually
arose
,
until
it
reached
the
foot
of
Pendle
Hill
,
which
here
assuming
its
most
majestic
aspect
,
constituted
the
grand
and
peculiar
feature
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Nowhere
could
the
lordly
eminence
be
seen
to
the
same
advantage
as
from
this
point
,
and
Nicholas
contemplated
it
with
feelings
of
rapture
,
which
no
familiarity
could
diminish
.
<EOS>
The
sun
shone
brightly
upon
its
rounded
summit
,
and
upon
its
seamy
sides
,
revealing
all
its
rifts
and
ridges
;
adding
depth
of
tint
to
its
dusky
soil
,
laid
bare
in
places
by
the
winter
torrents
;
lending
new
beauty
to
its
purple
heath
,
and
making
its
grey
sod
glow
as
with
fire
.
<EOS>
So
exhilarating
was
the
prospect
,
that
Nicholas
felt
half
tempted
to
cross
the
valley
and
scale
the
hill
before
breaking
his
fast
;
but
other
feelings
checked
him
,
and
he
turned
towards
the
right
.
<EOS>
Here
,
beyond
a
paddock
and
some
outbuildings
,
lay
the
park
,
small
in
extent
,
but
beautifully
diversified
,
<EOS>
well
stocked
with
deer
,
and
boasting
much
noble
timber
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
was
an
exquisite
knoll
,
which
,
besides
commanding
a
fine
view
of
Pendle
Hill
,
Downham
,
and
all
the
adjacent
country
,
brought
within
its
scope
,
on
the
one
hand
,
the
ancient
castle
of
Clithero
and
the
heights
overlooking
Whalley
;
and
,
on
the
other
,
the
lovely
and
extensive
vale
through
which
the
Ribble
wandered
.
<EOS>
This
,
also
,
was
a
favourite
point
of
view
with
the
squire
,
and
he
had
some
idea
of
walking
towards
it
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
person
who
came
from
the
house
,
and
who
shouted
to
him
,
hoarsely
but
blithely
,
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
-
comer
was
a
man
of
middle
age
,
with
a
skin
almost
as
tawny
as
a
gipsy
's
,
a
hooked
nose
,
black
beetling
brows
,
and
eyes
so
strangely
set
in
his
head
,
that
they
communicated
a
sinister
expression
to
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
possessed
a
burly
frame
,
square
,
and
somewhat
heavy
,
though
not
so
much
so
as
to
impede
his
activity
.
<EOS>
In
deportment
and
stature
,
though
not
in
feature
,
he
resembled
the
squire
himself
;
and
the
likeness
was
heightened
by
his
habiliments
being
part
of
Nicholas
's
old
wardrobe
,
the
doublet
and
hose
,
and
even
the
green
hat
and
boots
,
being
those
in
which
Nicholas
made
his
first
appearance
in
this
history
.
<EOS>
The
personage
who
thus
condescended
to
be
fed
and
clothed
at
the
squire
's
expense
,
and
who
filled
a
situation
something
between
guest
and
menial
,
without
receiving
the
precise
attention
of
the
one
or
the
wages
of
the
other
,
but
who
made
himself
so
useful
to
Nicholas
that
he
could
not
dispense
with
him
--
neither
,
perhaps
would
he
have
been
shaken
off
,
even
if
it
had
been
desired
--
was
named
Lawrence
Fogg
,
an
entire
stranger
to
the
country
,
whom
Nicholas
had
picked
up
at
Colne
,
and
whom
he
had
invited
to
Downham
for
a
few
weeks
'
hunting
,
and
had
never
been
able
to
get
rid
of
him
since
.
 
<EOS>
Lawrence
Fogg
liked
his
quarters
immensely
,
and
determined
to
remain
in
them
;
and
as
a
means
to
so
desirable
an
end
,
he
studied
all
the
squire
's
weak
points
and
peculiarities
,
and
these
not
being
very
difficult
to
be
understood
,
he
soon
mastered
them
,
and
mastered
the
squire
into
the
bargain
,
but
without
allowing
his
success
to
become
manifest
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
was
delighted
to
find
one
with
tastes
so
congenial
to
his
own
,
who
was
so
willing
to
hunt
or
fish
with
him
--
who
could
train
a
hawk
as
well
as
Phil
Royle
,
the
falconer
--
<EOS>
diet
a
fighting
-
cock
as
well
as
Tom
Shaw
,
the
cock
-
master
--
enter
a
hound
better
than
Charlie
Crouch
,
the
old
huntsman
--
<EOS>
shoot
with
the
long
-
bow
further
than
any
one
except
himself
,
and
was
willing
to
toss
off
a
pot
with
him
,
or
sing
a
merry
stave
whenever
he
felt
inclined
.
<EOS>
Such
a
companion
was
invaluable
,
and
Nicholas
congratulated
himself
upon
the
discovery
,
especially
when
he
found
Lawrence
Fogg
not
unwilling
to
undertake
some
delicate
commissions
for
him
,
which
he
could
not
well
execute
himself
,
and
which
he
was
unwilling
should
reach
Mistress
Assheton
's
ears
.
<EOS>
These
were
managed
with
equal
adroitness
and
caution
.
<EOS>
About
the
same
time
,
too
,
Nicholas
finding
money
scarce
,
and
,
not
liking
to
borrow
it
in
person
,
delegated
Fogg
,
and
sent
him
round
to
his
friends
to
ask
for
a
loan
;
but
,
in
this
instance
,
the
mission
was
attended
with
very
indifferent
success
,
for
not
one
of
them
would
lend
him
so
small
<EOS>
a
sum
as
thirty
pounds
,
all
averring
they
stood
in
need
of
it
quite
as
much
as
himself
.
<EOS>
Though
somewhat
inconvenienced
by
their
refusal
,
Nicholas
bore
the
disappointment
with
his
customary
equanimity
,
and
made
merry
with
his
friend
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Fogg
showed
an
equal
accommodating
spirit
in
all
religious
observances
,
and
,
though
much
against
his
inclination
,
attended
morning
discourses
and
lectures
with
his
patron
,
and
even
made
an
attempt
at
psalm
-
singing
;
but
on
one
occasion
,
missing
the
tune
and
coming
in
with
a
bacchanalian
chorus
,
he
was
severely
rebuked
by
the
minister
,
and
enjoined
to
keep
silence
in
future
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
friendly
relation
subsisting
between
the
parties
when
they
met
together
on
the
lawn
on
the
morning
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Fogg
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
after
exchanging
salutations
with
his
friend
,
"
what
say
you
to
hunting
the
otter
in
the
Ribble
after
breakfast
?
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
rare
day
for
the
sport
,
and
the
hounds
are
in
excellent
order
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
old
dam
and
her
litter
whom
we
must
kill
,
for
she
has
been
playing
the
very
devil
with
the
fish
for
a
space
of
more
than
two
miles
;
and
if
we
let
her
off
for
another
week
,
we
shall
have
neither
salmon
,
trout
,
nor
umber
,
as
all
will
have
passed
down
the
maws
of
her
voracious
brood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
that
would
be
a
pity
,
in
good
sooth
,
squire
,
"
replied
Fogg
;
"
for
there
are
no
fish
like
those
of
the
Ribble
.
<EOS>
Nothing
I
should
prefer
to
the
sport
you
promise
;
but
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
other
business
for
me
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
Another
attempt
to
borrow
money
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
from
my
cousin
,
Dick
Assheton
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
he
will
lend
me
the
thirty
pounds
,
I
am
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
But
you
had
better
defer
the
visit
till
to
-
morrow
,
when
his
father
,
Sir
Richard
,
will
be
at
Whalley
,
and
when
you
can
have
him
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
Dick
will
not
say
you
nay
,
depend
on't
;
he
is
too
good
a
fellow
for
that
.
<EOS>
A
murrain
on
those
close
-
fisted
curmudgeons
,
Roger
Nowell
,
Nicholas
Townley
,
and
Tom
Whitaker
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
be
delighted
to
oblige
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
they
declare
they
have
no
money
,
"
said
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
money!--pshaw
!
"
exclaimed
Nicholas
;
"
an
idle
excuse
.
<EOS>
They
have
chests
full
.
<EOS>
Would
I
had
all
Roger
Nowell
's
gold
,
I
should
not
require
another
supply
for
years
.
<EOS>
But
,
'
sdeath
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
myself
for
a
paltry
thirty
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
might
venture
to
suggest
,
squire
,
while
you
are
about
it
,
I
would
ask
for
a
hundred
pounds
,
or
even
two
or
three
hundred
,

Fogg

<EOS>
"
Your
friends
will
think
all
the
better
of
you
,
and
feel
more
satisfied
you
intend
to
repay
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
by
Plutus
,
it
shall
be
three
hundred
pounds
--
three
hundred
at
interest
.
<EOS>
Dick
will
have
to
borrow
the
amount
to
lend
it
to
me
;
but
,
no
matter
,
he
will
easily
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
Harkye
,
Fogg
,
while
you
are
at
Middleton
,
endeavour
to
ascertain
whether
any
thing
has
been
arranged
about
the
marriage
of
a
certain
young
lady
to
a
certain
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
am
curious
to
know
the
precise
state
of
affairs
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
arrive
at
the
truth
,
if
possible
,
squire
,
"
replied
Fogg
;
"
but
I
should
scarcely
think
Sir
Richard
would
assent
to
his
son
's
union
with
the
daughter
of
a
notorious
witch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Richard
's
son
is
scarcely
likely
to
ask
Sir
Richard
's
consent
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
"
and
as
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
though
heavy
charges
have
been
brought
against
her
,
nothing
has
been
proved
,
for
you
know
she
escaped
,
or
rather
was
rescued
,
on
her
way
to
Lancaster
Castle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
fully
aware
of
it
,
squire
,
"
<EOS>
replied
Fogg
;
"
and
I
more
than
suspect
a
worthy
friend
of
mine
had
a
hand
in
her
deliverance
and
could
tell
where
to
find
her
if
needful
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
.
<EOS>
The
lady
is
quite
innocent
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
quite
sure
of
it
,
since
you
espouse
her
cause
so
warmly
.
<EOS>
But
the
world
is
malicious
,
and
strange
things
are
reported
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
not
the
world
,
Fogg
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
world
speaks
well
of
no
man
,
be
his
deserts
what
they
may
.
<EOS>
The
world
says
that
I
waste
my
estate
in
wine
,
women
,
and
horseflesh
--
that
I
spend
time
in
pleasures
which
might
be
profitably
employed
--
that
I
neglect
my
wife
,
forget
my
religious
observances
,
am
on
horseback
when
I
should
be
afoot
,
at
the
alehouse
when
I
should
be
at
home
,
at
a
marriage
when
I
should
be
at
a
funeral
,
shooting
when
I
should
be
keeping
my
books
--
in
short
,
it
has
not
a
good
word
to
say
for
me
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
thee
,
Fogg
,
it
says
thou
art
an
idle
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
fellow
;
or
,
if
thou
art
good
for
aught
,
it
is
only
for
something
that
leads
to
evil
.
<EOS>
It
says
thou
drinkest
prodigiously
,
liest
confoundedly
,
and
swearest
most
profanely
;
that
thou
art
ever
more
ready
to
go
to
the
alehouse
than
to
church
,
and
that
none
of
the
girls
can
'
scape
thee
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
slanderers
even
go
so
far
as
to
assert
thou
wouldst
not
hesitate
to
say
,
'
Stand
and
deliver
!
'
<EOS>
to
a
true
man
on
the
highway
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
the
world
says
of
thee
.
<EOS>
But
,
hang
it
!
<EOS>
never
look
chapfallen
,
man
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
to
the
stables
,
and
then
we
will
in
to
breakfast
;
after
which
we
will
proceed
to
the
Ribble
,
and
spear
the
old
otter
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
fine
old
manorial
residence
was
Downham
,
and
beautifully
situated
,
as
has
been
shown
,
on
a
woody
eminence
to
the
north
of
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
great
antiquity
,
and
first
came
into
the
possession
of
the
Assheton
family
in
1558
.
<EOS>
Considerable
additions
had
been
made
to
it
by
its
present
owner
,
Nicholas
,
and
the
outlay
necessarily
required
,
combined
with
his
lavish
expenditure
,
had
contributed
to
embarrass
him
.
<EOS>
The
stables
were
large
,
and
full
of
horses
;
the
kennels
on
the
same
scale
,
and
equally
well
supplied
with
hounds
;
and
there
was
a
princely
retinue
of
servants
in
the
yard
--
grooms
,
keepers
,
falconers
,
huntsmen
,
and
their
assistants
--
to
say
nothing
of
their
fellows
within
doors
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
if
it
had
been
your
fortune
to
accompany
the
squire
and
his
friend
round
the
premises
--
if
you
had
walked
through
the
stables
and
counted
the
horses
--
if
you
had
viewed
the
kennels
and
examined
the
various
hounds
--
the
great
Lancashire
dogs
,
tall
,
shaggy
,
and
heavy
,
a
race
now
extinct
;
the
Worcestershire
hounds
,
then
also
in
much
repute
;
the
greyhounds
,
the
harriers
,
the
beagles
,
the
lurchers
,
and
,
lastly
,
the
verminers
,
or
,
as
we
should
call
them
,
the
terriers,--if
you
had
seen
all
these
,
you
would
not
have
wondered
that
money
was
scarce
with
him
.
<EOS>
Still
further
would
your
surprise
at
such
a
consequence
have
diminished
if
you
had
gone
on
to
the
falconry
,
and
seen
on
the
perches
the
goshawk
and
her
tercel
,
the
sparrowhawk
and
her
musket
,
under
the
care
of
the
ostringer
;
and
further
on
the
falcon
-
gentle
,
the
gerfalcon
,
the
lanner
,
the
merlin
,
and
the
hobby
,
all
of
which
were
attended
to
by
the
head
falconer
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
done
you
good
to
hear
Nicholas
inquiring
from
his
men
if
they
had
"
set
out
their
birds
that
morning
,
and
weathered
them
;
"
if
they
had
mummy
powder
in
readiness
,
then
esteemed
a
sovereign
remedy
;
if
the
lures
,
hoods
,
jesses
,
buets
,
and
all
other
needful
furniture
,
were
in
good
order
;
and
if
the
meat
were
sweet
and
wholesome
.
<EOS>
You
might
next
have
followed
him
to
the
pens
where
the
fighting
cocks
were
kept
,
and
where
you
would
have
found
another
source
of
expense
in
the
cock
-
master
,
Tom
Shaw
--
a
knave
who
not
only
got
high
wages
from
his
master
,
but
understood
so
well
the
dieting
of
his
birds
that
he
could
make
them
win
or
lose
a
battle
as
he
thought
proper
.
<EOS>
Here
,
again
,
Nicholas
had
much
to
say
,
and
was
in
raptures
with
one
cock
,
which
he
told
Fogg
he
would
back
to
any
amount
,
utterly
unconscious
of
a
significant
look
that
passed
between
his
friend
and
the
cock
-
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
him
,
"
cried
the
squire
;
"
how
proud
and
erect
he
stands
!
<EOS>
His
head
is
as
small
as
that
of
a
sparrowhawk
,
his
eye
large
and
quick
,
his
body
thick
,
his
leg
strong
in
the
beam
,
and
his
spurs
long
,
rough
,
and
sharp
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
bird
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
him
over
to
the
cockpit
at
Prescot
next
week
,
and
match
him
against
any
bird
Sir
John
Talbot
,
or
my
cousin
Braddyll
,
can
bring
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yo'n
win
,
squoire
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
cock
-
master
;
"
<EOS>
ey
ha
'
been
<EOS>
feedin
'
him
<EOS>
these
five
weeks
,
so
he
'll
be
<EOS>
i
'
rare
condition
then
,
and
winna
fail
yo
.
<EOS>
Yo
may
lay
what
yo
loike
upon
him
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
sly
wink
at
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
win
the
thirty
pounds
you
want
,
"
observed
the
latter
,
in
a
low
tone
to
the
squire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
,
mayhap
,
lose
it
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
risk
so
much
,
unless
I
get
the
three
hundred
from
Dick
Assheton
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
unlucky
of
late
.
<EOS>
You
beat
me
constantly
at
tables
now
,
Fogg
,
and
when
I
first
knew
you
this
was
not
wo
nt
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
never
make
any
excuses
,
man
;
you
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
Let
us
in
to
breakfast
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
proceeded
towards
the
house
,
followed
by
Fogg
and
a
couple
of
large
Lancashire
hounds
,
and
,
entering
at
the
back
of
the
premises
,
made
his
way
through
the
scullery
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Here
there
were
plentiful
evidences
of
the
hospitality
,
not
to
say
profusion
,
reigning
throughout
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
An
open
door
showed
a
larder
stocked
with
all
kinds
of
provisions
,
and
before
the
fire
joints
of
meat
and
poultry
were
roasting
.
<EOS>
Pies
were
baking
in
the
oven
;
and
over
the
flames
,
in
the
chimney
,
was
suspended
a
black
pot
large
enough
for
a
witch
's
caldron
.
<EOS>
The
cook
was
busied
in
preparing
for
the
gridiron
some
freshly
-
caught
trout
,
intended
for
the
squire
's
own
breakfast
;
and
a
kitchen
-
maid
was
toasting
oatcakes
,
of
which
there
was
a
large
supply
in
the
bread
-
flake
depending
from
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
Casting
a
look
around
,
and
exchanging
a
few
words
with
the
cook
,
Nicholas
moved
on
,
still
followed
by
Fogg
and
the
hounds
,
and
,
tracking
a
long
stone
passage
,
entered
the
great
hall
.
<EOS>
Here
the
same
disorder
and
irregularity
prevailed
as
in
his
own
character
and
conduct
.
<EOS>
All
was
litter
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
Around
the
walls
were
hung
breastplates
and
buff
-
coats
,
morions
,
shields
,
and
two
-
handed
swords
;
but
they
were
half
hidden
by
fishing
-
nets
,
fowling
-
nets
,
dogs
'
collars
,
saddles
and
bridles
,
housings
,
cross
-
bows
,
long
-
bows
,
quivers
,
baldricks
,
horns
,
spears
,
guns
,
and
every
other
implement
then
used
in
the
sports
of
the
river
or
the
field
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
in
an
equal
state
of
disorder
.
<EOS>
The
rushes
were
filled
with
half
-
gnawed
bones
,
brought
thither
by
the
hounds
;
and
in
one
corner
,
on
a
mat
,
was
a
favourite
spaniel
and
her
whelps
.
<EOS>
The
squire
however
was
,
happily
,
insensible
to
the
condition
of
the
chamber
,
and
looked
around
it
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
,
as
if
he
thought
it
the
perfection
of
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
A
table
was
spread
for
breakfast
,
near
a
window
looking
out
upon
the
lawn
,
and
two
covers
only
were
laid
,
for
Mistress
Nicholas
Assheton
did
not
make
her
appearance
at
this
early
hour
.
<EOS>
And
now
was
exhibited
one
of
those
strange
contradictions
of
which
the
squire
's
character
was
composed
.
<EOS>
Kneeling
down
by
the
side
of
the
table
,
and
without
noticing
the
mocking
expression
of
Fogg
's
countenance
as
he
followed
his
example
,
Nicholas
prayed
loudly
and
fervently
for
upwards
of
ten
minutes
,
after
which
he
arose
and
gave
a
shout
which
proved
that
his
lungs
were
unimpaired
,
and
not
only
roused
the
whole
house
,
but
set
all
the
dogs
barking
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
a
couple
of
serving
-
men
answered
this
lusty
summons
,
and
the
table
was
covered
with
good
and
substantial
dishes
,
which
he
and
his
companion
attacked
with
a
vigour
such
as
only
the
most
valiant
trencherman
can
display
.
<EOS>
Already
has
it
been
remarked
that
a
breakfast
at
the
period
in
question
resembled
a
modern
dinner
;
and
better
proof
could
not
have
been
afforded
of
the
correctness
of
the
description
than
the
meal
under
discussion
,
which
comprised
fish
,
flesh
,
and
fowl
,
boiled
,
broiled
,
and
roast
,
together
with
strong
ale
and
sack
.
<EOS>
After
an
hour
thus
agreeably
employed
,
and
while
they
were
still
seated
,
though
breakfast
had
pretty
nearly
come
to
an
end
,
a
serving
-
man
entered
,
announcing
Master
Richard
Sherborne
of
Dunnow
.
<EOS>
The
squire
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
hastened
to
welcome
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
good
-
day
to
you
,
Dick
,
"
he
cried
,
shaking
him
heartily
by
the
hand
;
"
what
happy
chance
brings
you
here
so
early
?
<EOS>
But
first
sit
down
and
eat
--
eat
,
and
talk
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Roger
,
Harry
,
bring
another
platter
and
napkin
,
and
let
us
have
more
broiled
trout
and
a
cold
capon
,
a
pasty
,
or
whatever
you
can
find
in
the
larder
.
<EOS>
Try
some
of
this
gammon
meanwhile
,
Dick
.
<EOS>
It
will
help
down
a
can
of
ale
.
<EOS>
And
now
what
brings
thee
hither
,
lad
?
<EOS>
Pressing
business
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Thou
mayest
speak
before
Fogg
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
secrets
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
my
second
self
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
secrets
to
divulge
,
Nicholas
,
"
replied
Sherborne
,
"
and
I
will
tell
you
at
once
what
I
am
come
about
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
that
the
King
is
about
to
visit
Hoghton
Tower
in
August
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
this
is
news
to
me
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
does
your
business
relate
to
his
visit
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
,
"
replied
Sherborne
.
<EOS>
"
Last
night
a
messenger
came
to
me
from
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
entreating
me
to
move
you
to
do
him
the
favour
and
courtesy
to
attend
him
at
the
King
's
coming
,
and
wear
his
livery
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wear
his
livery
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Nicholas
,
indignantly
.
"
<EOS>
'
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
take
me
for
,
cousin
Dick
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
a
right
good
fellow
,
who
I
am
sure
will
comply
with
his
friend
's
request
,
especially
when
he
finds
there
is
no
sort
of
degradation
in
it
,
"
replied
Sherborne
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
shall
wear
Sir
Richard
's
cloth
,
and
so
will
several
others
of
our
friends
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
rare
doings
at
Hoghton
--
masquings
,
mummings
,
and
all
sorts
of
revels
,
besides
hunting
,
shooting
,
racing
,
wrestling
,
and
the
devil
knows
what
.
<EOS>
You
may
feast
and
carouse
to
your
heart
's
content
.
<EOS>
The
Dukes
of
Buckingham
and
Richmond
will
be
there
,
and
the
Earls
of
Nottingham
and
Pembroke
,
and
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
the
King
's
great
favourite
,
who
married
the
Duchess
of
Buckingham
's
sister
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
you
will
have
all
the
beauty
of
Lancashire

I
would
not
miss
the
sight
for
thirty
pounds

Thirty
pounds

<EOS>
"
echoed
Nicholas
,
as
if
struck
with
a
sudden
thought
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
Sir
Thomas
Hoghton
would
lend
me
that
sum
if
I
consent
to
wear
his
cloth
,
and
attend
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
,
"
replied
Sherborne
;
"
and
if
he
wo
n't
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
put
my
pride
in
my
pocket
,
and
go
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Dick
,
dispatch
your
breakfast
as
quickly
as
you
can
,
and
then
I
will
take
you
to
the
Ribble
,
and
show
you
some
sport
with
an
otter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Sherborne
was
not
long
in
concluding
his
repast
,
and
having
received
an
otter
spear
from
the
squire
,
who
had
already
provided
himself
and
Fogg
with
like
weapons
,
all
three
adjourned
to
the
kennels
,
where
they
found
the
old
huntsman
,
Charlie
Crouch
,
awaiting
them
,
attended
by
four
stout
varlets
,
armed
with
forked
staves
,
meant
for
the
double
purpose
of
beating
the
river
's
banks
,
and
striking
the
poor
beast
they
were
about
to
hunt
,
and
each
man
having
a
couple
of
hounds
,
well
entered
for
the
chase
,
in
leash
.
<EOS>
Old
Crouch
was
a
thin
,
grey
-
bearded
fellow
,
but
possessed
of
a
tough
,
muscular
frame
,
which
served
him
quite
as
well
in
the
long
run
as
the
younger
,
and
apparently
more
vigorous
,
limbs
of
his
assistants
.
<EOS>
His
cheek
was
hale
,
and
his
eye
still
bright
and
quick
,
and
a
certain
fierceness
was
imparted
to
his
countenance
by
a
large
aquiline
nose
.
<EOS>
He
was
attired
in
a
greasy
leathern
jerkin
,
tight
hose
of
the
same
material
,
and
had
a
bugle
suspended
from
his
neck
,
and
a
sharp
hunting
-
knife
thrust
into
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
In
his
hand
he
bore
a
spear
like
his
master
,
and
was
followed
by
a
grey
old
lurcher
,
who
,
though
wanting
an
ear
and
an
eye
,
and
disfigured
by
sundry
scars
on
throat
and
back
,
was
hardy
,
untiring
,
and
sagacious
.
<EOS>
This
ancient
dog
was
called
Grip
,
from
his
tenacity
in
holding
any
thing
he
set
his
teeth
upon
,
and
he
and
Crouch
were
inseparable
.
 
<EOS>
Great
was
the
clamour
occasioned
by
the
squire
's
appearance
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
The
coupled
hounds
gave
tongue
at
once
,
and
sang
out
most
melodiously
,
and
all
the
other
dogs
within
the
kennels
,
or
roaming
at
will
about
the
yard
,
joined
the
concert
.
<EOS>
After
much
swearing
,
cracking
of
whips
,
and
yelping
consequent
upon
the
cracking
,
silence
was
in
some
degree
restored
,
and
a
consultation
was
then
held
between
Nicholas
and
Crouch
as
to
where
their
steps
should
first
be
bent
.
<EOS>
The
old
huntsman
was
for
drawing
the
river
near
a
place
called
Bean
Hill
Wood
,
as
the
trees
thereabouts
,
growing
close
to
the
water
's
edge
<EOS>
,
it
was
pretty
certain
<EOS>
the
otter
would
have
her
couch
amid
the
roots
of
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
This
was
objected
to
by
one
of
the
varlets
,
who
declared
that
the
beast
lodged
in
a
hollow
tree
,
standing
on
a
bank
nearly
a
mile
higher
up
the
stream
,
and
close
by
the
point
of
junction
between
Swanside
Beck
and
the
Ribble
.
<EOS>
He
was
certain
of
the
fact
,
he
avouched
,
because
he
had
noticed
her
marks
on
the
moist
grass
near
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hoo
goes
theere
to
fish
,
mon
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Crouch
,
"
<EOS>
for
it
is
the
natur
o
'
the
wary
varmint
to
feed
at
a
distance
fro

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
put
myself
entirely
under
your
guidance
,
Crouch
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
An

"
replied
the
huntsman
;
"

"
 
<EOS>
"
A
brave
dog
,
but
confoundedly
ugly
!
"
exclaimed
the
squire
,
regarding
the
old
one
-
eared
,
one
-
eyed
lurcher
with
mingled
admiration
and
disgust
;
"
and
now
,
that
all
is
arranged
,
let
us
be
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
quitted
the
court
-
yard
,
and
,
shaping
their
course
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
huntsman
,
entered
the
park
,
and
proceeded
along
a
glade
,
checkered
by
the
early
sunbeams
.
<EOS>
Here
the
noise
they
made
in
their
progress
speedily
disturbed
a
herd
of
deer
browsing
beneath
the
trees
,
and
,
as
the
dappled
foresters
darted
off
to
a
thicker
covert
,
great
difficulty
was
experienced
by
the
varlets
in
restraining
the
hounds
,
who
struggled
eagerly
to
follow
them
,
and
made
the
welkin
resound
with
their
baying
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yonder
is
a
tall
fellow
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
pointing
out
a
noble
buck
to
Crouch
;
"
I
must
kill
him
next
week
,
for
I
want
to
send
a
haunch
of
venison
to
Middleton
,
and
another
to
Whalley
Abbey
for
Sir
Ralph
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Better
hunt
him
,
squoire
,
"
said
Crouch
;
"
he
will
gi
'
ye
good
sport
.
"
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
they
attained
an
eminence
,
where
a
charming
sweep
of
country
opened
upon
them
,
including
the
finest
part
of
Ribblesdale
,
with
its
richly
-
wooded
plains
,
and
the
swift
and
beautiful
river
from
which
it
derived
its
name
.
<EOS>
The
view
was
enchanting
,
and
the
squire
and
his
companions
paused
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
it
,
and
then
,
stepping
gleefully
forward
,
made
their
way
over
the
elastic
turf
towards
a
small
thicket
skirting
the
park
.
<EOS>
All
were
in
high
spirits
,
for
the
freshness
and
beauty
of
the
morning
had
not
been
without
effect
,
and
the
squire
's
tongue
kept
pace
with
his
legs
as
he
strode
briskly
along
;
but
as
they
entered
the
thicket
in
question
,
and
caught
sight
of
the
river
through
the
trees
,
the
old
huntsman
enjoined
silence
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
put
a
check
upon
his
loquacity
.
 
<EOS>
When
within
a
bowshot
from
the
water
,
the
party
came
to
a
halt
,
and
two
of
the
men
were
directed
by
Crouch
to
cross
the
stream
at
different
points
,
and
then
commence
beating
the
banks
,
while
the
other
two
were
ordered
to
pursue
a
like
course
,
but
to
keep
on
the
near
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
hounds
were
next
uncoupled
,
and
the
men
set
off
to
execute
the
orders
they
had
received
,
and
soon
afterwards
the
crashing
of
branches
,
and
the
splashing
of
water
,
accompanied
by
the
deep
baying
of
the
hounds
,
told
they
were
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Nicholas
and
the
others
had
not
remained
idle
.
<EOS>
As
the
varlets
struck
off
in
different
directions
,
they
went
straight
on
,
and
forcing
their
way
through
the
brushwood
,
came
to
a
high
bank
overlooking
the
Ribble
,
on
<EOS>
the
top
of
which
grew
<EOS>
three
or
four
large
trees
,
whose
roots
,
laid
bare
on
the
further
side
by
the
swollen
currents
of
winter
,
formed
a
convenient
resting
-
place
for
the
fish
-
loving
creature
they
hoped
to
surprise
.
<EOS>
Receiving
a
hint
from
Crouch
to
make
for
the
central
tree
,
Nicholas
grasped
his
spear
,
and
sprang
forward
;
but
,
quick
as
he
was
,
he
was
too
late
,
though
he
saw
enough
to
convince
him
that
the
crafty
old
huntsman
had
been
correct
in
his
judgment
;
for
a
dark
,
slimy
object
dropped
from
out
the
roots
of
the
tree
beneath
him
,
and
glided
into
the
water
as
swiftly
and
as
noiselessly
as
if
its
skin
had
been
oiled
.
<EOS>
A
few
bubbles
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
water
,
but
these
were
all
the
indications
marking
the
course
of
the
wondrous
diver
.
 
<EOS>
But
other
eyes
,
sharper
than
those
of
Nicholas
,
were
on
the
watch
,
and
the
old
huntsman
shouted
out
,
"
There
hoo
goes
,
Grip
--
efter
her
,
lad
,
efter
her
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
the
dog
sprang
from
the
top
of
the
bank
and
sank
under
the
water
.
<EOS>
For
some
seconds
no
trace
could
be
observed
of
either
animal
,
and
then
the
shaggy
nose
of
the
lurcher
was
seen
nearly
fifty
yards
higher
up
the
river
,
and
after
sniffing
around
for
a
moment
,
and
fixing
his
single
eye
on
his
master
,
who
was
standing
on
the
bank
,
and
encouraging
him
with
his
voice
and
gesture
,
he
dived
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Station
yourselves
on
the
bank
,
fifty
paces
apart
,
"
cried
Crouch
;
"
run
,
run
,
or
yo'n
be
too
late
,
an
'
strike
os
quick
<EOS>
os
leet
if
yo've
a
chance
.
<EOS>
Stay
wheere
you
are
,
squoire
,
"
he
added
,
to
Nicholas
.
"
<EOS>
Yo
canna
be
better
placed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
All
was
now
animation
and
excitement
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
from
the
noise
that
the
otter
had
been
found
,
the
four
varlets
hastened
towards
the
scene
of
action
,
and
,
by
their
shouts
and
the
clatter
of
their
staves
,
contributed
greatly
to
its
spirit
.
<EOS>
Two
were
on
one
side
of
the
stream
,
and
two
on
the
other
,
and
up
to
this
moment
the
hounds
were
similarly
separated
;
but
now
most
of
them
had
taken
to
the
water
,
some
swimming
about
,
others
standing
up
to
the
middle
in
the
shallower
part
of
the
current
,
watching
with
keen
gaze
for
the
appearance
of
their
anticipated
victim
.
 
<EOS>
Having
descended
the
bank
,
Nicholas
had
so
placed
himself
among
the
huge
twisted
roots
of
the
tree
,
that
if
the
otter
,
alarmed
by
the
presence
of
so
many
foes
,
and
unable
to
escape
either
up
or
down
the
river
,
should
return
to
her
couch
,
he
made
certain
of
striking
her
.
<EOS>
At
first
there
seemed
little
chance
of
such
an
occurrence
,
for
Fogg
,
who
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
higher
up
,
suddenly
dashed
into
the
stream
,
and
,
plunging
his
spear
into
the
mud
,
cried
out
that
he
had
hit
the
beast
;
but
the
next
moment
,
when
he
drew
the
weapon
forth
,
and
exhibited
a
large
rat
which
he
had
transfixed
,
his
mistake
excited
much
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Crouch
,
meantime
,
did
not
suffer
his
attention
to
be
drawn
from
his
dog
.
<EOS>
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
saw
him
come
to
the
surface
to
breathe
,
but
as
he
kept
within
a
short
distance
,
though
rising
at
different
points
,
the
old
huntsman
felt
certain
the
otter
had
not
got
away
,
and
,
having
the
utmost
reliance
upon
Grip
's
perseverance
and
sagacity
<EOS>
,
he
felt
confident
he
would
bring
the
quarry
to
him
if
the
thing
were
possible
.
<EOS>
The
varlets
kept
up
an
incessant
clatter
,
beating
the
water
with
their
staves
,
and
casting
large
stones
into
it
,
while
the
hounds
bayed
furiously
,
so
that
the
poor
fugitive
was
turned
on
whichever
side
<EOS>
she
attempted
a
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
Nicholas
was
cautioned
by
the
huntsman
to
look
out
,
and
scarcely
had
the
admonition
reached
him
than
the
sleek
shining
body
of
the
otter
emerged
from
the
water
,
and
wreathed
itself
among
the
roots
.
<EOS>
The
squire
instantly
dealt
a
blow
which
he
expected
to
prove
fatal
,
but
his
mortification
was
excessive
when
he
found
he
had
driven
the
spear
-
head
so
deeply
into
the
tree
that
he
could
scarcely
disengage
it
,
while
an
almost
noiseless
plunge
told
that
his
prey
had
escaped
.
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
same
moment
that
the
poor
hunted
beast
had
sought
its
old
lodging
,
the
untiring
lurcher
had
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
bank
,
and
,
as
the
former
again
went
down
,
he
dived
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
Secretly
laughing
at
the
squire
's
failure
,
the
old
huntsman
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
a
similar
opportunity
if
it
should
present
itself
,
and
with
this
view
ensconced
himself
behind
a
pollard
willow
,
which
stood
close
beside
the
stream
,
and
whence
he
could
watch
closely
all
that
passed
,
without
being
exposed
to
view
.
<EOS>
The
prudence
of
the
step
was
soon
manifest
.
<EOS>
After
the
lapse
of
a
few
seconds
,
during
which
neither
dog
nor
otter
had
risen
to
breathe
,
a
slight
,
very
slight
,
undulation
was
perceptible
on
the
surface
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
Crouch
's
grasp
tightened
upon
his
staff
--
he
waited
another
moment
--
then
dashed
forward
,
struck
down
his
spear
,
and
raised
it
aloft
,
with
the
poor
otter
transfixed
and
writhing
upon
its
point
.
 
<EOS>
Loudly
and
exultingly
did
the
old
man
shout
at
his
triumph
,
and
loudly
were
his
vociferations
answered
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
All
flew
to
the
spot
where
he
was
standing
,
and
the
hounds
,
gathering
round
him
,
yelled
furiously
at
the
otter
,
and
showed
every
disposition
to
tear
her
in
pieces
,
if
they
could
get
at
her
.
<EOS>
Kicking
the
noisiest
and
fiercest
of
them
out
of
the
way
,
Crouch
approached
the
river
's
brink
,
and
lowered
the
spear
-
head
till
it
came
within
reach
of
his
favourite
Grip
,
who
had
not
yet
come
out
of
the
water
,
but
stood
within
his
depth
,
with
his
one
red
eye
fixed
on
the
enemy
he
had
so
hotly
pursued
,
and
fully
expecting
his
reward
.
<EOS>
It
now
came
;
his
sharp
teeth
instantly
met
in
the
otter
's
throat
,
and
when
Crouch
swung
them
both
in
the
air
,
he
still
maintained
his
hold
,
showing
how
well
he
deserved
his
name
,
nor
could
he
be
disengaged
until
long
after
the
sufferings
of
the
tortured
animal
had
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
To
say
that
Nicholas
was
neither
chagrined
at
his
ill
success
,
nor
jealous
of
the
old
huntsman
's
superior
skill
,
would
be
to
affirm
an
untruth
;
but
he
put
the
best
face
he
could
upon
the
matter
,
and
praised
Grip
very
highly
,
alleging
that
the
whole
merit
of
the
hunt
rested
with
him
.
<EOS>
Old
Crouch
let
him
go
on
,
and
when
he
had
done
,
quietly
observed
that
the
otter
they
had
destroyed
was
not
the
one
they
came
in
search
of
,
as
they
had
seen
nothing
of
her
litter
;
and
that
,
most
likely
,
the
beast
that
had
done
so
much
mischief
had
her
lodging
in
the
hollow
tree
near
the
Swanside
Beck
,
as
described
by
the
varlet
,
and
he
wished
to
know
whether
the
squire
would
like
to
go
and
hunt
her
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
replied
that
he
was
quite
willing
to
do
so
,
and
hoped
he
should
have
better
luck
on
the
second
occasion
;
and
with
this
they
set
forward
again
,
taking
their
way
along
the
side
of
the
stream
,
beating
the
banks
as
they
went
,
but
without
rousing
any
thing
beyond
an
occasional
water
-
rat
,
which
was
killed
almost
as
soon
as
found
by
Grip
.
 
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
,
without
any
one
being
aware
what
led
to
it
the
conversation
fell
upon
the
two
old
witches
,
Mothers
Demdike
and
Chattox
,
and
the
strange
manner
in
which
their
career
had
terminated
on
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
--
if
,
indeed
it
could
be
said
to
have
terminated
,
when
their
spirits
were
reported
to
haunt
the
spot
,
and
might
be
seen
,
it
was
asserted
,
at
midnight
,
flitting
round
the
beacon
,
and
shrieking
dismally
.
<EOS>
The
restless
shades
were
pursued
,
it
was
added
,
by
the
figure
of
a
monk
in
white
mouldering
robes
,
supposed
to
be
the
ghost
of
Paslew
.
<EOS>
It
was
difficult
to
understand
how
these
apparitions
could
be
witnessed
,
since
no
one
,
even
for
a
reward
,
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
ascend
Pendle
Hill
after
nightfall
;
but
the
shepherds
affirmed
they
had
seen
them
from
below
,
and
that
was
testimony
sufficient
to
shake
the
most
sceptical
.
<EOS>
One
singular
circumstance
was
mentioned
,
which
must
not
be
passed
by
without
notice
;
and
this
was
,
that
when
the
cinders
of
the
extinct
beacon
-
fire
came
to
be
examined
,
no
remains
whatever
of
the
two
hags
could
be
discovered
,
though
the
ashes
were
carefully
sifted
,
and
it
was
quite
certain
that
the
flames
had
expired
long
before
their
bodies
could
be
consumed
.
<EOS>
The
explanation
attempted
for
this
marvel
was
,
that
Satan
had
carried
them
off
while
yet
living
,
to
finish
their
combustion
in
a
still
more
fiery
region
.
 
<EOS>
Mention
of
Mother
Demdike
naturally
led
to
her
grandson
,
Jem
Device
,
who
,
having
escaped
in
a
remarkable
manner
on
the
night
in
question
,
notwithstanding
the
hue
and
cry
made
after
him
,
had
not
,
as
yet
,
been
captured
,
though
he
had
been
occasionally
seen
at
night
,
and
under
peculiar
circumstances
,
by
various
individuals
,
and
amongst
others
by
old
Crouch
,
who
,
however
,
declared
he
had
been
unable
to
lay
hands
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Allusion
was
then
made
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
whereupon
it
was
observed
that
the
squire
changed
the
conversation
quickly
;
while
sundry
sly
winks
and
shrugs
were
exchanged
among
the
varlets
of
the
kennel
,
seeming
to
intimate
that
they
knew
more
about
the
matter
than
they
cared
to
admit
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
,
however
,
was
elicited
than
that
the
escort
conducting
her
to
Lancaster
Castle
,
together
with
the
other
witches
,
after
their
examination
before
the
magistrates
at
Whalley
,
and
committal
,
had
been
attacked
,
while
it
was
passing
through
a
woody
defile
in
Bowland
Forest
,
by
a
party
of
men
in
the
garb
of
foresters
,
and
the
lady
set
free
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
she
been
heard
of
since
.
<EOS>
What
made
this
rescue
the
more
extraordinary
was
,
that
none
of
the
other
witches
were
liberated
at
the
same
time
,
but
some
of
them
who
seemed
disposed
to
take
advantage
of
the
favourable
interposition
,
and
endeavoured
to
get
away
,
were
brought
back
by
the
foresters
to
the
officers
of
justice
;
thus
clearly
proving
that
the
attempt
was
solely
made
on
Mistress
Nutter
's
account
,
and
must
have
been
undertaken
by
her
friends
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
it
was
asserted
,
could
equal
the
rage
and
mortification
of
Roger
Nowell
and
Potts
,
on
learning
that
their
chief
prey
had
thus
escaped
them
;
and
by
their
directions
,
for
more
than
a
week
,
the
strictest
search
was
made
for
the
fugitive
throughout
the
neighbourhood
,
but
without
effect
--
no
clue
could
be
discovered
to
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
Suspicion
naturally
fell
upon
the
two
Asshetons
,
Nicholas
and
Richard
,
and
Roger
Nowell
roundly
taxed
them
with
contriving
and
executing
the
enterprise
in
person
;
while
Potts
told
them
they
were
guilty
of
misprision
of
felony
,
and
threatened
them
with
imprisonment
for
life
,
forfeiture
of
goods
and
of
rents
,
for
the
offence
;
but
as
the
charge
could
not
be
proved
against
them
,
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
of
the
magistrate
and
attorney
,
it
fell
to
the
ground
;
and
Master
Potts
,
full
of
chagrin
at
this
unexpected
and
vexatious
termination
of
the
affair
,
returned
to
London
,
and
settled
himself
in
his
chambers
in
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
His
duties
,
however
,
as
clerk
of
the
court
,
would
necessarily
call
him
to
Lancaster
in
August
,
when
the
assizes
commenced
,
and
when
he
would
assist
at
the
trials
of
such
of
the
witches
as
were
still
in
durance
.
 
<EOS>
From
Mother
Demdike
it
was
natural
that
the
conversation
should
turn
to
her
weird
retreat
,
Malkin
Tower
;
and
Richard
Sherborne
expressed
his
surprise
that
the
unhallowed
structure
should
be
suffered
to
remain
standing
after
her
removal
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
said
he
was
equally
anxious
with
his
brother
-
in
-
law
for
its
demolition
,
but
it
was
not
so
easily
to
be
accomplished
as
it
might
appear
;
for
the
deserted
structure
was
in
such
ill
repute
with
the
common
folk
,
as
well
as
every
one
else
,
that
no
one
dared
approach
it
,
even
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
A
boggart
,
it
was
said
,
had
taken
possession
of
its
vaults
,
and
scared
away
all
who
ventured
near
it
;
sometimes
showing
himself
in
one
frightful
shape
,
and
sometimes
in
another
;
now
as
a
monstrous
goat
,
now
as
an
equally
monstrous
cat
,
uttering
fearful
cries
,
glaring
with
fiery
eyes
from
out
of
the
windows
,
or
appearing
in
all
his
terror
on
the
summit
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
haunted
structure
was
frequently
lighted
up
at
dead
of
night
,
strains
of
unearthly
music
were
heard
resounding
from
it
,
and
wild
figures
were
seen
flitting
past
the
windows
,
as
if
engaged
in
dancing
and
revelry
;
so
that
it
appeared
that
no
alteration
for
the
better
had
taken
place
there
,
and
that
things
were
still
quite
as
improperly
conducted
now
,
as
they
had
been
in
the
time
of
Mother
Demdike
,
or
in
those
of
her
predecessors
,
Isole
de
Heton
and
Blackburn
,
the
robber
.
<EOS>
The
common
opinion
was
,
that
Satan
and
all
his
imps
had
taken
up
their
abode
in
the
tower
,
and
,
as
they
liked
their
quarters
,
led
a
jolly
life
there
,
dancing
and
drinking
all
night
long
,
it
would
be
useless
at
present
to
give
them
notice
to
quit
,
still
less
to
attempt
to
pull
down
the
house
about
their
ears
.
<EOS>
Richard
Sherborne
heard
this
wondrous
relation
in
silence
,
but
with
a
look
of
incredulity
;
and
when
it
was
done
he
winked
slily
at
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
A
strange
expression
,
half
comical
,
half
suspicious
,
might
also
have
been
observed
on
Fogg
's
countenance
;
and
he
narrowly
watched
the
squire
as
the
latter
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
with
the
disappearance
of
the
malignant
old
hags
who
had
so
long
infested
the
neighbourhood
,
had
all
mischief
and
calamity
ceased
,
or
were
people
as
much
afflicted
as
heretofore
?
<EOS>
Were
there
,
in
short
,
so
many
cases
of
witchcraft
,
real
or
supposed
?
<EOS>
"
This
was
the
question
next
addressed
by
Sherborne
to
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
The
squire
answered
decidedly
there
were
not
.
<EOS>
Since
the
burning
of
the
two
old
beldames
,
and
the
imprisonment
of
the
others
,
the
whole
district
of
Pendle
had
improved
.
<EOS>
All
those
who
had
been
smitten
with
strange
illnesses
had
recovered
;
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
little
village
of
Sabden
,
who
had
experienced
the
fullest
effects
of
their
malignity
,
were
entirely
free
from
sickness
.
<EOS>
And
not
only
had
they
and
their
families
suddenly
regained
health
and
strength
,
but
all
belonging
to
them
had
undergone
a
similar
beneficial
change
.
<EOS>
The
kine
that
had
lost
their
milk
now
yielded
it
abundantly
;
the
lame
horse
halted
no
longer
;
the
murrain
ceased
among
the
sheep
;
the
pigs
that
had
grown
lean
amidst
abundance
fattened
rapidly
;
and
though
the
farrows
that
had
perished
during
the
evil
ascendency
of
the
witches
could
not
be
brought
back
again
,
their
place
promised
speedily
to
be
supplied
by
others
.
<EOS>
The
corn
blighted
early
in
the
year
had
sprung
forth
anew
,
and
the
trees
nipped
in
the
bud
were
laden
with
fruit
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
all
was
as
fair
and
as
flourishing
as
it
had
recently
been
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
John
Law
,
the
pedlar
,
who
had
been
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
by
the
damnable
arts
of
Mother
Demdike
,
had
marvellously
recovered
on
the
very
night
of
her
destruction
,
and
was
now
as
strong
and
as
active
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
Such
happy
results
having
followed
the
removal
of
the
witches
,
it
was
to
be
hoped
,
"
Sherborne
said
,
"
that
the
riddance
would
be
complete
,
and
that
none
of
the
obnoxious
brood
would
be
left
to
inflict
future
miseries
on
their
fellows
.
<EOS>
This
could
not
be
the
case
so
long
as
James
Device
was
allowed
to
go
at
large
;
nor
while
his
mother
,
Elizabeth
Device
,
a
notorious
witch
,
was
suffered
to
escape
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
Jennet
,
Elizabeth
's
daughter
,
a
mischievous
and
ill
-
favoured
little
creature
,
who
inherited
all
the
ill
qualities
of
her
parents
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
spawn
of
the
old
snake
,
and
,
until
they
were
entirely
exterminated
,
there
could
be
no
security
against
a
recurrence
of
the
evil
.
<EOS>
Again
,
there
was
Nance
Redferne
,
old
Chattox
's
grand
-
daughter
,
a
comely
woman
enough
,
but
a
reputed
witch
,
and
an
undoubted
fabricator
of
clay
images
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
at
liberty
,
though
she
ought
to
be
with
the
rest
in
the
dungeons
of
Lancaster
Castle
.
<EOS>
It
was
useless
to
allege
that
with
the
destruction
of
the
old
hags
all
danger
had
ceased
.
<EOS>
Common
prudence
would
keep
the
others
quiet
now
;
but
the
moment
the
storm
passed
over
,
they
would
resume
their
atrocious
practices
,
and
all
would
be
as
bad
as
ever
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
the
tree
must
be
utterly
uprooted
,
or
it
would
inevitably
burst
forth
anew
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
opinions
Nicholas
generally
concurred
;
but
he
expressed
some
sympathy
for
Nance
Redferne
,
whom
he
thought
far
too
good
-
looking
to
be
as
wicked
and
malicious
as
represented
.
<EOS>
But
however
that
might
be
,
and
however
much
he
might
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
family
of
the
Devices
<EOS>
,
he
feared
such
a
step
might
be
attended
with
danger
to
Alizon
,
and
that
she
might
in
some
way
or
other
be
implicated
with
them
.
<EOS>
This
last
remark
he
addressed
in
an
under
-
tone
to
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Sherborne
did
not
at
first
feel
any
apprehension
on
that
score
,
but
,
on
reflection
,
he
admitted
that
Nicholas
was
perhaps
right
;
and
though
Alizon
was
now
the
recognised
daughter
of
Mistress
Nutter
,
yet
her
long
and
intimate
connection
with
the
Device
family
might
operate
to
her
prejudice
,
while
her
near
relationship
to
an
avowed
witch
would
not
tend
to
remove
the
unfavourable
impression
.
<EOS>
Sherborne
then
went
on
to
speak
in
the
most
rapturous
terms
of
the
beauty
and
goodness
of
the
young
girl
who
formed
the
subject
of
their
conversation
,
and
declared
he
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
that
Richard
Assheton
was
so
much
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
he
added
,
a
most
extraordinary
change
had
taken
place
in
her
since
the
dreadful
night
on
Pendle
Hill
,
when
her
mother
's
guilt
had
been
proclaimed
,
and
when
her
arrest
had
taken
place
as
an
offender
of
the
darkest
dye
.
<EOS>
Alizon
,
he
said
,
had
lost
none
of
her
beauty
,
but
her
light
and
joyous
expression
of
countenance
had
been
supplanted
by
a
look
of
profound
sadness
,
which
nothing
could
remove
.
<EOS>
Gentle
and
meek
in
her
deportment
<EOS>
,
she
seemed
to
look
upon
herself
as
under
a
ban
,
and
as
if
she
were
unfit
to
associate
with
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Richard
Assheton
and
his
sister
endeavoured
to
remove
this
impression
by
the
tenderest
assiduities
;
in
vain
they
sought
to
induce
her
to
enter
into
amusements
consistent
with
her
years
;
she
declined
all
society
but
their
own
,
and
passed
the
greater
part
of
her
time
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
Sherborne
had
seen
her
so
engaged
,
and
the
expression
of
her
countenance
,
he
declared
,
was
seraphic
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
extreme
verge
of
a
high
bank
situated
at
the
point
of
junction
between
Swanside
Beck
and
the
Ribble
,
stood
an
old
,
decayed
oak
.
<EOS>
Little
of
the
once
mighty
tree
beyond
the
gnarled
trunk
was
left
,
and
this
was
completely
hollow
;
while
there
was
a
great
rift
near
the
bottom
through
which
a
man
might
easily
creep
,
and
,
when
once
in
,
stand
erect
without
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
Beneath
the
bank
the
river
was
deep
and
still
,
forming
a
pool
,
where
the
largest
and
fattest
fish
were
to
be
met
with
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
this
,
the
spot
was
extremely
secluded
,
being
rarely
visited
by
the
angler
on
account
of
the
thick
copse
by
which
it
was
surrounded
and
which
extended
along
the
back
,
from
the
point
of
confluence
between
the
lesser
and
the
larger
stream
,
to
Downham
mill
,
nearly
half
a
mile
distant
.
 
<EOS>
The
sides
of
the
Ribble
were
here
,
as
elsewhere
,
beautifully
wooded
,
and
as
the
clear
stream
winded
along
through
banks
of
every
diversity
of
shape
and
character
,
and
covered
by
forest
trees
of
every
description
,
and
of
the
most
luxuriant
growth
,
the
effect
was
enchanting
;
the
more
so
,
that
the
sun
,
having
now
risen
high
in
the
heavens
,
poured
down
a
flood
of
summer
heat
and
radiance
,
that
rendered
these
cool
shades
inexpressibly
delightful
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
was
it
,
as
the
huntsmen
leaped
from
stone
to
stone
,
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
waters
rushing
past
them
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
as
they
sprang
upon
some
green
holm
or
fairy
islet
,
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
stream
,
and
dividing
its
lucid
waters
,
to
suffer
the
eye
to
follow
the
course
of
the
rapid
current
,
and
to
see
it
here
sparkling
in
the
bright
sunshine
,
there
plunged
in
shade
by
the
overhanging
trees
--
now
fringed
with
osiers
and
rushes
,
now
embanked
with
smoothest
sward
of
emerald
green
;
<EOS>
anon
defended
by
steep
rocks
,
sometimes
bold
and
bare
,
but
more
frequently
clothed
with
timber
;
then
sinking
down
by
one
of
those
sudden
but
exquisite
transitions
,
which
nature
alone
dares
display
,
from
this
savage
and
sombre
character
into
the
softest
and
gentlest
expression
;
every
where
varied
,
yet
every
where
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
Through
such
scenes
of
silvan
loveliness
had
the
huntsmen
passed
on
their
way
to
the
hollow
oak
,
and
they
had
ample
leisure
to
enjoy
them
,
because
the
squire
and
his
brother
-
in
-
law
being
engaged
in
conversation
,
as
before
related
,
made
frequent
pauses
,
and
,
during
these
,
the
others
halted
likewise
;
and
even
the
hounds
,
glad
of
a
respite
,
stood
still
,
or
amused
themselves
by
splashing
about
amid
the
shallows
without
any
definite
object
unless
of
cooling
themselves
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
the
leaders
once
more
moved
forward
,
arose
the
cheering
shout
,
the
loud
deep
bay
,
the
clattering
of
staves
,
the
crashing
of
branches
,
and
all
the
other
inspiriting
noises
accompanying
the
progress
of
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
But
for
some
minutes
these
had
again
ceased
,
and
as
Nicholas
and
Sherborne
lingered
beneath
the
shade
of
a
wide
-
spread
beech
-
tree
growing
on
a
sandy
hillock
near
the
stream
,
and
seemed
deeply
interested
in
their
talk
--
as
well
they
might
,
for
it
related
to
Alizon
--
the
whole
troop
,
including
Fogg
,
held
respectfully
aloof
,
and
awaited
their
pleasure
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
signal
to
move
was
,
at
length
,
given
by
the
squire
,
who
saw
they
were
now
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
the
bank
on
which
stood
the
hollow
tree
they
were
anxious
to
reach
.
<EOS>
As
the
river
here
made
a
turn
,
and
swept
round
the
point
in
question
,
forming
,
owing
to
this
detention
,
the
deep
pool
previously
mentioned
,
the
bank
almost
faced
them
,
and
,
as
nothing
intervened
,
they
could
almost
look
into
the
rift
near
the
base
of
the
tree
,
forming
<EOS>
,
they
supposed
,
the
entrance
to
the
otter
's
couch
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
this
was
easily
distinguished
,
no
traces
of
the
predatory
animal
could
be
seen
;
and
though
many
sharp
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
spot
during
the
prolonged
discourse
of
the
two
gentlemen
,
nothing
had
occurred
to
attract
their
attention
,
and
to
prove
that
the
object
of
their
quest
was
really
there
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
little
consultation
between
the
squire
and
Crouch
,
it
was
agreed
that
the
former
should
alone
force
his
way
to
the
tree
,
while
the
others
were
to
station
themselves
with
the
hounds
at
various
points
of
the
stream
,
above
and
below
the
bank
,
so
that
,
if
the
otter
and
her
litter
escaped
their
first
assailant
,
they
should
infallibly
perish
by
the
hands
of
some
of
the
others
.
<EOS>
This
being
agreed
upon
,
the
plan
was
instantly
put
into
execution
--
two
of
the
varlets
remaining
where
they
were
--
two
going
higher
up
;
while
Sherborne
and
Fogg
stationed
themselves
on
great
stones
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
,
whence
they
could
command
all
around
them
,
and
Crouch
,
wading
on
with
Grip
,
planted
himself
at
the
entrance
of
Swanside
Beck
into
the
Ribble
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
squire
having
scaled
the
bank
,
entered
the
thick
covert
encircling
it
,
and
,
not
without
some
damage
to
his
face
and
hands
from
the
numerous
thorns
and
brambles
growing
amongst
it
,
forced
his
way
upwards
until
he
reached
the
bare
space
surrounding
the
hollow
tree
;
and
this
attained
,
his
first
business
was
to
ascertain
that
all
was
in
readiness
below
before
commencing
the
attack
.
<EOS>
A
glance
showed
him
on
one
side
old
Crouch
standing
up
to
his
middle
in
the
beck
,
grasping
his
long
otter
spear
,
and
with
Grip
beating
the
water
in
front
of
him
in
anxious
expectation
of
employment
;
and
in
front
Fogg
,
Sherborne
,
and
two
of
the
varlets
,
with
their
hounds
so
disposed
that
they
could
immediately
advance
upon
the
otter
if
it
plunged
into
the
river
,
while
its
passage
up
or
down
would
be
stopped
by
their
comrades
.
<EOS>
All
this
he
discerned
at
a
glance
;
and
comprehending
from
a
sign
made
him
by
the
old
huntsman
that
he
should
not
delay
<EOS>
,
he
advanced
towards
the
tree
,
and
was
about
to
plunge
his
spear
into
the
hole
,
hoping
to
transfix
one
at
least
of
its
occupants
,
when
he
was
startled
by
hearing
a
deep
voice
apparently
issue
from
the
hollows
of
the
timber
,
bidding
him
"
Beware
!
"
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
recoiled
aghast
,
for
he
thought
it
might
be
Hobthurst
,
or
the
demon
of
the
wood
,
who
thus
bespoke
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
accursed
thing
addresses
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
standing
on
his
guard
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Get
hence
,
Nicholas
Assheton
,
"
replied
the
voice
;
"
an
'
meddle
not
wi
'
them
<EOS>
os
meddles
not
wi
'
thee
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
exclaimed
the
squire
,
recovering
courage
,
for
he
thought
this
did
not
sound
like
the
language
of
a
demon
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
known
am
I
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
go
hence
,
and
at
whose
bidding
?
"
 
"
Ask
neaw
questions

"
replied
the
voice
,
"
or
<EOS>

<EOS>
Ey

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha

<EOS>

<EOS>

"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
For
a
spirit
,
thou
usest
the
vernacular
of
the
county
fairly
enough
.
<EOS>
But
before
trying
whether
thy
hide
be
proof
against
mortal
weapons
I
command
thee
to
come
forth
and
declare
thyself
,
that
I
may
judge
what
manner
of

art
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thoud'st
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
ey

,
"
replied
the
boggart
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
methinks
I
should
know
those
accents
,
"
exclaimed
the
squire
;
"
they
marvellously
resemble
the
voice
of
an
offender
who
has
too
long
evaded
justice
,
and
whom
I
have
now
fairly
entrapped
.
<EOS>
Jem
Device
,
thou
art
known
,
lad
,
and
if
thou
dost
not
surrender
at
discretion
,
I
will
strike
my
spear
through
this
rotten
tree
,
and
spit
thee
<EOS>
as
I
would
the
beast
<EOS>
I
came
in
quest
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
'
which
yo
wad
more
easily
than
me
,
"
retorted
Jem
.
<EOS>
And
suddenly
springing
from
the
hole
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
,
he
passed
between
the
squire
's
legs
with
great
promptitude
,
and
flinging
him
face
foremost
upon
the
ground
,
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
,
and
thence
dropped
into
the
deep
pool
below
.
 
<EOS>
The
plunge
roused
all
the
spectators
,
who
,
though
they
had
heard
what
had
passed
,
and
had
seen
the
squire
upset
in
the
manner
described
,
had
been
so
much
astounded
that
they
could
render
no
assistance
;
but
they
now
,
one
and
all
,
bestirred
themselves
actively
to
seize
the
diver
when
he
should
rise
to
the
surface
.
<EOS>
But
though
every
eye
was
on
the
look
-
out
,
and
every
arm
raised
;
though
the
hounds
were
as
eager
as
their
masters
,
and
yelling
fiercely
,
swam
round
the
pool
,
ready
to
pounce
upon
the
swimmer
as
upon
a
duck
,
all
were
disappointed
;
for
,
even
after
a
longer
interval
than
their
patience
could
brook
,
he
did
not
appear
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Nicholas
had
regained
his
legs
,
and
,
infuriated
by
his
discomfiture
,
approached
the
edge
of
the
bank
,
and
peering
down
below
,
hoped
to
detect
the
fugitive
immediately
beneath
him
,
resolved
to
show
him
no
mercy
when
he
caught
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
equally
at
fault
with
the
others
,
and
after
more
than
five
minutes
spent
in
ineffectual
search
,
he
ordered
Crouch
to
send
Grip
into
the
pool
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
keeper
replied
that
the
dog
was
not
used
to
this
kind
of
chase
,
and
might
not
display
his
usual
skill
in
it
;
but
as
the
squire
would
take
no
nay
,
he
was
obliged
to
consent
,
and
the
other
hounds
were
called
off
lest
they
should
puzzle
him
.
<EOS>
Twice
did
the
shrewd
lurcher
swim
round
the
pool
,
sniffing
the
air
,
after
which
he
approached
the
shore
,
and
scented
close
to
the
bank
;
still
it
was
evident
he
could
detect
nothing
,
and
Nicholas
began
to
despair
,
when
the
dog
suddenly
dived
.
<EOS>
Expectation
was
then
raised
to
the
utmost
,
and
all
were
on
the
watch
again
,
Nicholas
leaning
over
the
edge
of
the
bank
with
his
spear
in
hand
,
prepared
to
strike
;
but
the
dog
was
so
long
in
reappearing
,
that
all
had
given
him
up
for
lost
,
and
his
master
was
giving
utterance
to
ejaculations
of
grief
and
rage
,
and
vowing
vengeance
against
the
warlock
,
when
Grip
's
grisly
head
was
once
more
seen
above
the
surface
of
the
water
,
and
this
time
he
had
a
piece
of
blue
serge
in
his
jaws
,
proving
that
he
had
had
hold
of
the
raiments
of
the
fugitive
,
and
that
therefore
the
latter
could
not
be
far
off
,
but
had
most
probably
got
into
some
hole
beneath
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
this
notion
suggested
than
it
was
acted
on
by
the
old
huntsman
and
Fogg
,
and
,
wading
forward
,
they
pricked
the
bank
with
their
spears
at
various
points
below
the
level
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
Fogg
fell
forward
.
<EOS>
His
spear
had
entered
a
hole
,
and
had
penetrated
so
deeply
that
he
had
lost
his
balance
.
<EOS>
But
though
,
soused
over
head
and
ears
,
he
had
made
a
successful
hit
,
for
the
next
moment
Jem
Device
appeared
above
the
water
,
and
ere
he
could
dive
again
his
throat
was
seized
by
Grip
,
and
while
struggling
to
free
himself
from
the
fangs
of
the
tenacious
animal
,
he
was
laid
hold
of
by
Crouch
,
and
the
varlets
rushing
forward
to
the
latter
's
assistance
,
the
ruffian
was
captured
.
 
<EOS>
Some
difficulty
was
experienced
in
rescuing
the
captive
from
the
jaws
of
the
hounds
,
who
,
infuriated
by
his
struggles
,
and
perhaps
mistaking
him
for
some
strange
beast
of
chase
,
made
their
sharp
teeth
meet
in
various
parts
of
his
person
,
rending
his
garments
from
his
limbs
,
and
would
no
doubt
have
rent
the
flesh
also
,
if
they
had
been
permitted
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
much
fighting
and
struggling
,
mingled
with
yells
and
vociferations
,
Jem
was
borne
ashore
,
and
flung
on
the
ground
,
where
he
presented
a
wretched
spectacle
;
bleeding
,
half
-
drowned
,
and
covered
with
slime
acquired
during
his
occupation
of
the
hole
in
the
bank
.
<EOS>
But
though
unable
to
offer
further
resistance
,
his
spirit
was
not
quelled
,
and
his
eye
glared
terribly
at
his
captors
.
<EOS>
Fearing
they
might
have
further
trouble
with
him
when
he
recovered
from
his
present
exhausted
condition
,
Crouch
had
his
hands
bound
tightly
together
with
one
of
the
dog
leashes
,
and
then
would
fain
have
questioned
him
as
to
how
he
managed
to
breathe
in
a
hole
below
the
level
of
the
water
;
but
Jem
refused
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
,
and
returned
only
a
sullen
rejoinder
to
any
questions
addressed
to
him
,
until
the
squire
,
who
had
crossed
the
river
at
some
stepping
-
stones
lower
down
,
came
up
,
and
the
ruffian
then
inquired
,
in
a
half
-
menacing
tone
,
what
he
meant
to
do
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
mean
to
do
with
you
?
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
lad
.
<EOS>
I
shall
send
you
at
once
to
Whalley
to
be
examined
before
the
magistrates
;
and
,
as
the
proofs
are
pretty
clear
against

,
you
will
be
forwarded
without
any
material
delay

Castle

"

replied
Nicholas
;
"
but
thy
vindictive

be
frustrated

<EOS>
No

"
 
<EOS>
"
Heed
him
not
,
"
interposed
Sherborne
,
seeing
that
the
squire
was
shaken
by
his
threat
,
and
taking
him
apart
;
"
it
will
not
do
to
let
such
a
villain
escape
.
<EOS>
He
can
do
you
no
injury
,
and
as
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
if
you
know
where
she
is
,
it
will
be
easy
to
give
her
a
hint
to
get
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
ey
might
be
so
bowd
os
offer
my
advice
,
squoire

"
said
old
Crouch
,
advancing
towards
his
master
,
"
<EOS>
ey'd

<EOS>
a

round

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
would
silence
him
effectually
,
no
doubt
,
Crouch
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
laughing
;
"
but
a
dog
's
death
is
too
good
for
him
,
and
besides
I
am
pretty
sure
his
destiny
is
not
drowning
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
--
at
all
risks
he
shall
go
to
Whalley
.
<EOS>
Harkee
,
Fogg
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
<EOS>
beckoning
that
worthy
to
him
,
"
I
commit
the
conduct
and
custody
of
the
prisoner
to
you
.
<EOS>
Clap
him
on
a
horse
,
get
on
another
yourself
,
take
these
four
varlets
with
you
,
and
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
who
will
relieve
you
of
all
further
trouble
and
responsibility
.
<EOS>
But
you
may
add
this
to
the
baronet
from
me
,
"
he
continued
,
in
an
under
-
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
recommend
him
to
place
under
immediate
arrest
Elizabeth
Device
,
the
prisoner
's
mother
,
and
her
daughter
Jennet
.
<EOS>
You
understand
,
<EOS>
Fogg
--
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
returned
the
other
,
with
a
somewhat
singular
look
;
"
and
your
instructions
shall
be
fulfilled
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
thing
more
to
commit
to
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Only
this
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
"
you
may
tell
Sir
Ralph
that
I
propose
to
sleep
at
the
Abbey
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
shall
ride
over
to
Middleton
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
to
confer
with
Dick
Assheton
upon
what
has
just
occurred
,
and
get
the
money
from
him
--
the
three
hundred
pounds
,
you
understand
--
and
when
my
errand
is
done
,
I
will
turn
bridle
towards
Whalley
.
<EOS>
I
shall
return
by
Todmorden
,
and
through
the
gorge
of
Cliviger
.
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
tarry
for
me
at
the
Abbey
,
for
Sir
Ralph
will
be
glad
of
thy
company
,
and
we
can
return
together
to
Downham
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
squire
thus
spoke
,
he
noticed
a
singular
sparkle
in
Fogg
's
ill
-
set
eyes
;
but
he
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
,
though
it
subsequently
occurred
to
his
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
prisoner
,
finding
no
grace
likely
to
be
shown
him
,
shouted
out
to
the
squire
,
that
if
he
were
set
free
,
he
would
make
certain
important
disclosures
to
him
respecting
Fogg
,
who
was
not
what
he
represented
himself
;
but
Nicholas
treated
the
offer
with
disdain
;
and
the
individual
mainly
interested
in
the
matter
,
who
appeared
highly
incensed
by
Jem
's
malignity
,
cut
a
short
peg
by
way
of
gag
,
and
,
thrusting
it
into
the
ruffian
's
mouth
,
effectually
checked
any
more
revelations
on
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
Fogg
then
ordered
the
varlets
to
bring
on
the
prisoner
;
but
as
Jem
obstinately
refused
to
move
,
they
were
under
the
necessity
of
taking
him
on
their
shoulders
,
and
transporting
him
in
this
manner
to
the
stables
,
where
he
was
placed
on
a
horse
,
as
directed
by
the
squire
.

CHAPTER
II.--THE
PENITENT
'S
RETREAT
.
  
<EOS>
Nicholas
and
Sherborne
returned
by
a
different
road
from
that
taken
by
the
others
,
and
loitered
so
much
by
the
way
that
they
did
not
arrive
at
the
manor
-
house
until
the
prisoner
and
his
escort
had
set
out
.
<EOS>
Probably
this
was
designed
,
as
Nicholas
seemed
relieved
when
he
learnt
they
were
gone
.
<EOS>
Having
entered
the
house
with
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
conducted
him
to
an
apartment
opening
out
of
the
hall
,
usually
occupied
by
Mistress
Assheton
,
and
where
,
in
fact
,
they
found
that
amiable
lady
employed
at
her
embroidery
,
he
left
Sherborne
with
her
,
and
,
making
some
excuse
for
his
own
hasty
retreat
,
betook
himself
to
another
part
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Mounting
the
principal
staircase
,
which
was
of
dark
oak
,
with
richly
-
carved
railing
,
he
turned
into
a
gallery
communicating
with
the
sleeping
apartments
,
and
,
after
proceeding
more
than
half
-
way
down
it
,
halted
before
a
door
,
which
he
unlocked
,
and
entered
a
spacious
but
evidently
disused
chamber
,
hung
round
with
faded
tapestry
,
and
containing
a
large
gloomy
-
looking
bedstead
.
<EOS>
Securing
the
door
carefully
after
him
,
Nicholas
raised
the
hangings
in
one
corner
of
the
room
,
and
pressing
against
a
spring
,
a
sliding
panel
flew
open
.
<EOS>
A
screen
was
placed
within
,
so
as
to
hide
from
view
the
inmate
of
the
secret
chamber
,
and
Nicholas
,
having
coughed
slightly
,
to
announce
his
presence
,
and
received
an
answer
in
a
low
,
melancholy
female
voice
,
stepped
through
the
aperture
,
and
stood
within
a
small
closet
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
tenanted
by
a
lady
,
whose
features
and
figure
bore
the
strongest
marks
of
affliction
.
<EOS>
Her
person
was
so
attenuated
that
she
looked
little
more
than
a
skeleton
--
<EOS>
her
fingers
were
long
and
thin
--
her
cheeks
hollow
and
deathly
pale
--
<EOS>
her
eyes
lustreless
and
deep
sunken
in
their
sockets
--
and
her
hair
,
once
jetty
as
the
raven
's
wing
,
prematurely
blanched
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
profound
gloom
stamped
upon
her
countenance
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
look
upon
her
without
compassion
;
while
,
in
spite
of
her
wo
-
begone
looks
,
there
was
a
noble
character
about
her
that
elevated
the
feeling
into
deep
interest
,
blended
with
respect
.
<EOS>
She
was
kneeling
beside
a
small
desk
,
with
an
open
Bible
laid
upon
it
,
which
she
was
intently
studying
when
the
squire
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
terrible
text
for
you
,
Nicholas
,
"
she
said
,
regarding
him
,
mournfully
.
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
it
,
and
judge
of
its
effect
on
me
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
is
written
in
Deuteronomy:--'There
<EOS>
shall
not
be
found
among
you
any
one
that
maketh
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
,
or
that
useth
divination
,
or
an
observer
of
times
,
or
an
enchanter
,
or
a
witch
.
'
<EOS>
A
witch
,
Nicholas
--
do
you
mark
the
word
?
<EOS>
And
yet
more
particular
is
the
next
verse
<EOS>
,
wherein
it
is
said;--'Or
a
charmer
,
or
a
consulter
with
familiar
spirits
,
or
a
wizard
,
or
a
necromancer
.
'
<EOS>
And
then
cometh
the
denunciation
of
divine
anger
against
such
offenders
in
these
awful
words:--'For
all
that
do
these
things
<EOS>
are
an
abomination
unto
the
Lord
:
and
because
of
these
abominations
,
the
Lord
thy
God
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
.
'
<EOS>
Again
,
it
is
said
in
Leviticus
,
that
'
the
Lord
setteth
his
face
against
such
,
to
cut
them
off
.
'
<EOS>
And
in
Exodus
,
the
law
is
expressly
laid
down
thus--'THOU
SHALT
NOT
SUFFER
A
WITCH
TO
LIVE
.
'
<EOS>
There
is
no
escape
for
her
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
By
the
divine
command
she
must
perish
,
and
human
justice
must
;
carry
out
the
decree
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
I
am
one
of
the
offenders
thus
denounced
,
thus
condemned
.
<EOS>
I
have
practised
witchcraft
,
consulted
with
familiar
spirits
,
and
done
other
abominations
in
the
sight
of
Heaven
;
and
I
ought
to
pay
the
full
penalty
of
my
offences
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
,
I
beseech
you
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
squire
,
"
continue
to
take
this
view
of
your
case
.
<EOS>
However
you
have
sinned
,
you
have
made
amends
by
the
depth
and
sincerity
of
your
repentance
.
<EOS>
Your
days
and
nights
--
for
you
allow
yourself
only
such
rest
as
nature
forces
on
you
,
and
take
even
that
most
unwillingly
--
are
passed
in
constant
prayer
.
<EOS>
Your
abstinence
is
severer
than
any
anchoress
ever
practised
,
for
I
am
sure
for
the
last
month
you
have
not
taken
as
much
food
altogether
as
I
consume
in
a
day
;
while
,
not
content
with
this
,
you
perform
acts
of
penance
that
afflict
me
beyond
measure
to
think
upon
,
and
which
I
have
striven
in
vain
to
induce
you
to
forego
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
occasion
to
deliver
yourself
up
to
justice
,
madam
;
for
,
if
you
go
on
thus
,
and
do
not
deal
with
yourself
a
little
more
mildly
,
your
accounts
with
this
world
will
be
speedily
settled
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
should
rejoice
to
think
so
,
Nicholas
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
if
I
had
any
hope
in
the
world
to
come
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
none
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
by
any
act
of
penitence
and
contrition
,
expiate
my
offences
.
<EOS>
My
soul
is
darkened
by
despair
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
ought
to
give
myself
up
--
that
Heaven
and
man
alike
require
my
life
,
and
I
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
avoiding
my
just
doom
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
Evil
One
who
puts
these
thoughts
into
your
head
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
and
who
fills
your
heart
with
promptings
of
despair
,
that
he
may
again
obtain
the
mastery
over
it
.
<EOS>
But
take
a
calmer
and
more
consolatory
view
of
your
condition
.
<EOS>
Human
justice
may
require
a
public
sacrifice
as
an
example
,
but
Heaven
,
will
be
satisfied
with
contrition
in
secret
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
so
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
vainly
striving
to
draw
comfort
from
his
words
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Nicholas
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
the
temptations
I
am
exposed
to
in
this
chamber
--
<EOS>
the
difficulty
I
experience
in
keeping
my
thoughts
fixed
on
one
object
--
the
distractions
I
undergo
--
the
mental
obscurations
--
the
faintings
of
spirit
--
the
bodily
prostration
--
the
terrors
,
the
inconceivable
terrors
,
that
assail
me
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
wish
my
spirit
would
flee
away
,
and
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
Rest
!
<EOS>
there
is
none
for
me
--
none
in
the
grave
--
none
beyond
the
grave
--
and
therefore
I
am
afraid
of
death
,
and
still
more
of
the
judgment
after
death
!
<EOS>
Man
might
inflict
all
the
tortures
he
could
devise
upon
this
poor
frame
.
<EOS>
I
would
bear
them
all
with
patience
,
with
delight
,
if
I
thought
they
would
purchase
me
immunity
hereafter
!
<EOS>
But
with
the
dread
conviction
,
the
almost
certainty
,
that
it
will
be
otherwise
<EOS>
,
I
can
only
look
to
the
final
consummation
with
despair
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Again
I
tell
you
these
suggestions
are
evil
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Son
of
God
,
who
sacrificed
himself
for
man
,
and
by
whose
atonement
all
mankind
hope
for
salvation
,
has
assured
us
that
the
greatest
sinner
who
repents
shall
be
forgiven
,
and
,
indeed
,
is
more
acceptable
in
the
eyes
of
Heaven
than
him
who
has
never
erred
.
<EOS>
Far
be
it
from
me
to
attempt
to
exculpate
you
in
your
own
eyes
,
or
extenuate
your
former
criminality
.
<EOS>
You
have
sinned
deeply
,
so
deeply
that
you
may
well
shrink
aghast
from
the
contemplation
of
your
past
life
--
may
well
recoil
in
abhorrence
from
yourself
--
and
may
fitly
devote
yourself
to
constant
prayer
and
acts
of
penitence
.
<EOS>
But
having
cast
off
your
iniquity
,
and
sincerely
repented
,
I
bid
you
hope
--
<EOS>
I
bid
you
place
a
confident
reliance
in
the
clemency
of
an
all
-
merciful
power
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
much
comfort
,
Nicholas
,
"
said
the
lady
,
"
and
if
tears
of
blood
can
wash
away
my
sin
they
shall
be
shed
;
but
much
as
you
know
of
my
wickedness
,
even
you
can
not
conceive
its
extent
.
<EOS>
In
my
madness
,
for
it
was
nothing
else
,
I
cast
off
all
hopes
of
heaven
,
renounced
my
Redeemer
,
was
baptised
by
the
demon
,
and
entered
into
a
compact
by
which
--
I
shudder
to
speak
it
--
my
soul
was
surrendered
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
placed
yourself
in
fearful
jeopardy
,
no
doubt
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
but
you
have
broken
the
contract
in
time
,
and
an
all
righteous
judge
will
not
permit
the
penalty
of
the
bond
to
be
exacted
.
<EOS>
Seeing
your
penitence
,
Satan
has
relinquished
all
claim
to
your
soul
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
contest
the
point
to
the
last
,
and
it
is
only
at
the
last
that
it
will
be
decided
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
a
sound
like
mocking
laughter
reached
the
ears
of
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
that
?
"
demanded
Mistress
Nutter
,
in
accents
of
wildest
terror
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
ever
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
--
I
knew
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Clasping
her
hands
together
,
and
fixing
her
looks
on
high
<EOS>
she
then
addressed
the
most
fervent
supplications
to
Heaven
for
deliverance
from
evil
,
and
erelong
her
troubled
countenance
began
to
resume
its
former
serenity
,
proving
that
the
surest
balm
for
a
"
mind
diseased
"
is
prayer
.
<EOS>
Her
example
had
been
followed
by
Nicholas
,
who
,
greatly
alarmed
,
had
dropped
upon
his
knees
likewise
,
and
now
arose
with
somewhat
more
composure
in
his
demeanour
and
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
I
do
not
bring
you
good
news
,
madam
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
Jem
Device
has
been
arrested
this
morning
,
and
as
the
fellow
is
greatly
exasperated
against
me
,
he
threatens
to
betray
your
retreat
to
the
officers
;
and
though
he
is
,
probably
,
unacquainted
with
it
notwithstanding
his
boasting
,
still
he
may
cause
search
to
be
made
,
and
,
therefore
,
I
think
you
had
better
be
removed
to
some
other
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Deliver
me
up
without
more
ado
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
Nicholas
,
"
said
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
resolution
on
that
point
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
,
"
and
,
therefore
,
it
is
idle
to
attempt
to
shake
it
.
<EOS>
For
your
daughter
's
sake
,
if
not
for
your
own
,
I
will
save
you
,
in
spite
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
fix
a
brand
for
ever
on
Alizon
's
name
;
you
would
not
destroy
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
,
"
replied
the
wretched
lady
.
"
<EOS>
But
have
you
heard
from
her
--
have
you
seen
her
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
is
she
well
and
happy
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
well
,
and
would
be
happy
,
were
it
not
for
her
anxiety
about
you
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
evasively
.
"
<EOS>
But
for
her
sake
--
mine
--
your
own
--
I
must
urge
you
to
seek
some
other
place
of
refuge
to
night
,
for
if
you
are
discovered
here
you
will
bring
ruin
on
us
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
no
longer
debate
the
point
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
Where
shall
I
go
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
place
of
absolute
security
,
but
I
do
not
like
to
mention
it
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
still
,
as
it
will
only
be
necessary
to
remain
for
a
day
or
two
,
till
the
search
is
over
,
when
you
can
return
here
,
it
can
not
much
matter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
it
?
"
asked
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Malkin
Tower
,
"
answered
the
squire
,
with
some
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
go
to
that
accursed
place
,
"
cried
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Send
me
hence
when
you
will
--
now
,
or
at
midnight
--
and
let
me
seek
shelter
on
the
bleak
fells
or
on
the
desolate
moors
,
but
bid
me
not
go
there
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
it
is
the
best
and
safest
place
for
you
,
"
returned
Nicholas
,
somewhat
testily
;
"
and
for
this
reason
,
that
,
being
reputed
to
be
haunted
,
no
one
will
venture
to
molest
you
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mother
Demdike
,
I
suppose
you
are
not
afraid
of
her
ghost
;
and
if
the
evil
beings
you
apprehend
were
able
or
inclined
to
do
you
mischief
,
they
would
not
wait
till
you
got
there
to
execute
their
purpose
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
I
was
wrong
to
hesitate
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
as
safe
there
as
here
--
ay
,
and
safer
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
"
or
I
would
not
urge
the
retreat
upon
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
about
to
ride
over
to
Middleton
this
morning
to
see
your
daughter
and
Richard
Assheton
,
and
shall
sleep
at
Whalley
,
so
that
I
shall
not
be
able
to
accompany
you
to
the
tower
to
-
night
;
but
old
Crouch
the
huntsman
shall
be
in
waiting
for
you
,
as
soon
as
it
grows
dusk
,
in
the
summer
-
house
,
with
which
,
as
you
know
,
the
secret
staircase
connected
with
this
room
communicates
,
and
he
shall
have
a
horse
in
readiness
to
take
you
,
together
with
such
matters
as
you
may
require
,
to
the
place
of
refuge
.
<EOS>
Heaven
guard
you
,
madam
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
responded
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
farewell
!
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hope
to
see
you
back
again
ere
<EOS>
many
days
be
gone
,
when
your
quietude
will
not
again
be
disturbed
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
stepped
back
,
and
,
passing
through
the
panel
,
closed
it
after
him
.

CHAPTER
III.--MIDDLETON
HALL
.
  
<EOS>
Middleton
Hall
,
the
residence
of
Sir
Richard
Assheton
,
was
a
large
quadrangular
structure
,
built
entirely
of
timber
,
and
painted
externally
in
black
and
white
checker
-
work
,
fanciful
and
varied
in
design
,
in
the
style
peculiar
to
the
better
class
of
Tudor
houses
in
South
Lancashire
and
Cheshire
.
<EOS>
Surrounded
by
a
deep
moat
,
supplied
by
a
neighbouring
stream
,
and
crossed
by
four
drawbridges
,
each
faced
by
a
gateway
,
this
vast
pile
of
building
was
divided
into
two
spacious
courts
,
one
of
which
contained
the
stables
,
barns
,
and
offices
,
while
the
other
was
reserved
for
the
family
and
the
guests
by
whom
the
hospitable
mansion
was
almost
constantly
crowded
.
<EOS>
In
the
last
-
mentioned
part
of
the
house
was
a
great
gallery
,
with
deeply
embayed
windows
filled
with
painted
glass
,
a
floor
of
polished
oak
,
walls
of
the
same
dark
lustrous
material
,
hung
with
portraits
of
stiff
beauties
,
some
in
ruff
and
farthingale
,
and
some
in
a
costume
of
an
earlier
period
among
whom
was
Margaret
Barton
,
who
brought
the
manor
of
Middleton
into
the
family
;
frowning
warriors
,
beginning
with
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
knight
-
marshal
of
England
in
the
reign
of
Edward
IV
.
,
and
surnamed
"
the
black
of
Assheton
-
under
-
line
,
"
the
founder
of
the
house
,
and
husband
of
Margaret
Barton
before
mentioned
,
and
ending
with
Sir
Richard
Assheton
,
grandfather
of
the
present
owner
of
the
mansion
,
and
one
of
the
heroes
of
Flodden
;
grave
lawyers
,
or
graver
divines
--
a
likeness
running
through
all
,
and
showing
they
belonged
to
one
line
--
a
huge
carved
mantelpiece
,
massive
tables
of
walnut
or
oak
,
and
black
and
shining
as
ebony
,
set
round
with
high
-
backed
chairs
.
<EOS>
Here
,
also
,
above
stairs
,
there
were
long
corridors
looking
out
through
lattices
upon
the
court
,
and
communicating
with
the
almost
countless
dormitories
;
while
,
on
the
floor
beneath
,
corresponding
passages
led
to
all
the
principal
chambers
,
and
terminated
in
the
grand
entrance
hall
,
the
roof
of
which
being
open
and
intersected
by
enormous
rafters
,
and
crooks
of
oak
,
like
the
ribs
of
some
"
tall
ammiral
,
"
was
thought
from
this
circumstance
,
as
well
as
from
its
form
,
to
resemble
"
a
ship
turned
upside
down
.
"
<EOS>
The
lower
beams
were
elaborately
carved
and
ornamented
with
gilded
bosses
and
sculptured
images
,
sustaining
shields
emblazoned
with
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
Asshetons
.
<EOS>
As
many
as
three
hundred
matchlocks
,
in
good
and
serviceable
condition
,
were
ranged
round
the
entrance
-
hall
,
besides
corselets
,
Almayne
rivets
,
steel
caps
,
and
other
accoutrements
;
<EOS>
this
stand
of
arms
having
been
collected
by
Sir
Richard
's
predecessor
,
during
the
military
muster
made
in
the
country
in
1574
,
when
he
had
raised
and
equipped
a
troop
of
horse
for
Queen
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
Outside
the
mansion
was
a
garden
,
charmingly
laid
out
in
parterres
and
walks
,
and
not
only
carried
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
,
but
continued
beyond
it
till
it
reached
a
high
knoll
crowned
with
beech
-
trees
.
<EOS>
A
crest
of
tall
twisted
chimneys
,
a
high
roof
with
quaintly
carved
gables
,
surmounted
by
many
gilt
vanes
,
may
serve
to
complete
the
picture
of
Middleton
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
lovely
summer
evening
,
two
young
persons
of
opposite
sexes
were
seated
on
a
bench
placed
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
largest
and
most
umbrageous
of
the
beech
-
trees
crowning
the
pleasant
eminence
before
mentioned
;
and
though
differing
in
aspect
and
character
,
the
one
being
excessively
fair
,
with
tresses
as
light
and
fleecy
as
the
clouds
above
them
,
and
eyes
as
blue
and
tender
as
the
skies
--
and
the
other
distinguished
by
great
manly
beauty
,
though
in
a
totally
different
style
;
still
there
was
a
sufficiently
strong
likeness
between
them
,
to
proclaim
them
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
Profound
melancholy
pervaded
the
countenance
of
the
young
man
,
whose
handsome
brow
was
clouded
by
care
--
while
the
girl
,
though
sad
,
seemed
so
only
from
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
conversing
together
in
deep
and
earnest
tones
,
showing
how
greatly
they
were
interested
;
and
,
as
they
proceeded
,
many
an
involuntary
sigh
was
heaved
by
Richard
Assheton
,
while
a
tear
,
more
than
once
,
dimmed
the
brightness
of
his
sister
's
eyes
,
and
her
hand
sought
by
its
gentle
pressure
to
re
-
assure
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
talking
of
Alizon
,
of
her
peculiar
and
distressing
situation
,
and
of
the
young
man
's
hopeless
love
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
general
theme
of
their
discourse
,
for
Richard
's
sole
comfort
was
in
pouring
forth
his
griefs
into
his
sister
's
willing
ear
;
but
new
causes
of
anxiety
had
been
given
them
by
Nicholas
,
who
had
arrived
that
afternoon
,
bringing
intelligence
of
James
Device
's
capture
,
and
of
his
threats
against
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
The
squire
had
only
just
departed
,
having
succeeded
in
the
twofold
object
of
his
visit
--
which
was
,
firstly
,
to
borrow
three
hundred
pounds
from
his
cousin
--
and
,
secondly
,
to
induce
him
to
attend
the
meeting
at
Hoghton
Tower
.
<EOS>
With
the
first
request
Richard
willingly
complied
,
and
he
assented
,
though
with
some
reluctance
,
to
the
second
,
provided
nothing
of
serious
moment
should
occur
in
the
interim
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
tried
to
rally
him
on
his
despondency
,
endeavouring
to
convince
him
all
would
come
right
in
time
,
and
that
his
misgivings
were
causeless
;
but
his
arguments
were
ineffectual
,
and
he
was
soon
compelled
to
desist
.
<EOS>
The
squire
would
fain
also
have
seen
Alizon
,
but
,
understanding
she
always
remained
secluded
in
her
chamber
till
eventide
,
he
did
not
press
the
point
.
<EOS>
Richard
urged
him
to
stay
over
the
night
,
alleging
the
length
of
the
ride
,
and
the
speedy
approach
of
evening
,
as
inducements
to
him
to
remain
;
but
on
this
score
the
squire
was
resolute
--
and
having
carefully
secured
the
large
sum
of
money
he
had
obtained
beneath
his
doublet
,
he
mounted
his
favourite
steed
,
Robin
,
who
seemed
as
fresh
as
if
he
had
not
achieved
upwards
of
thirty
miles
that
morning
,
and
rode
off
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
watched
him
cross
the
drawbridge
,
and
take
the
road
towards
Rochdale
,
and
,
after
exchanging
a
farewell
wave
of
the
hand
with
him
,
returned
to
the
hall
and
sought
out
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothy
was
easily
persuaded
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
with
her
brother
,
and
during
their
walk
he
confided
to
her
all
he
had
heard
from
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
Her
alarm
at
Jem
Device
's
threat
was
much
greater
than
his
own
;
and
,
though
she
entertained
a
strong
and
unconquerable
aversion
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
could
not
be
brought
to
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
her
penitence
,
still
,
for
Alizon
's
sake
,
she
dreaded
lest
any
harm
should
befall
her
,
and
more
particularly
desired
to
avoid
the
disgrace
which
would
be
inflicted
by
a
public
execution
.
<EOS>
Alizon
<EOS>
she
was
sure
would
not
survive
such
a
catastrophe
,
and
therefore
,
at
all
risks
,
it
must
be
averted
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
did
not
share
,
to
the
same
extent
,
in
her
apprehensions
,
because
he
had
been
assured
by
Nicholas
that
Mistress
Nutter
would
be
removed
to
a
place
of
perfect
security
,
and
because
he
was
disposed
,
with
the
squire
,
to
regard
the
prisoner
's
threats
as
mere
ravings
of
impotent
malice
.
<EOS>
Still
he
could
not
help
feeling
great
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
Vague
fears
,
too
,
beset
him
,
which
he
found
it
in
vain
to
shake
off
,
but
he
did
not
communicate
them
to
his
sister
,
as
he
knew
the
terrifying
effect
they
would
have
upon
her
timid
nature
;
and
he
,
therefore
,
kept
the
mental
anguish
he
endured
to
himself
,
hoping
erelong
it
would
diminish
in
intensity
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
he
was
deceived
,
for
,
instead
of
abating
,
his
gloom
and
depression
momently
increased
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
unconsciously
,
Richard
and
his
sister
had
quitted
the
garden
,
proceeding
with
slow
and
melancholy
steps
to
the
beech
-
crowned
knoll
.
<EOS>
The
seat
they
had
chosen
was
a
favourite
one
with
Alizon
,
and
she
came
thither
on
most
evenings
,
either
accompanied
by
Dorothy
or
alone
.
<EOS>
Here
it
was
that
Richard
had
more
than
once
passionately
besought
her
to
become
his
bride
,
receiving
on
both
occasions
a
same
meek
yet
firm
refusal
.
<EOS>
To
Dorothy
also
,
who
pleaded
her
brother
's
cause
with
all
the
eloquence
and
fervour
of
which
she
was
mistress
,
Alizon
replied
that
her
affections
were
fixed
upon
Richard
;
but
that
,
while
her
mother
lived
,
and
needed
her
constant
prayers
,
they
must
not
be
withheld
;
and
that
,
looking
upon
any
earthly
passion
as
a
criminal
interference
with
this
paramount
duty
,
she
did
not
dare
to
indulge
it
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
represented
to
her
that
the
sacrifice
was
greater
than
she
was
called
upon
to
make
,
that
her
health
was
visibly
declining
,
and
that
she
might
fall
a
victim
to
her
over
-
zeal
;
but
Alizon
was
deaf
to
her
remonstrances
,
as
she
had
been
to
the
entreaties
of
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
With
hearts
less
burthened
,
the
contemplation
of
the
scene
before
them
could
not
have
failed
to
give
delight
to
Richard
and
his
sister
,
and
,
even
amid
the
adverse
circumstances
under
which
it
was
viewed
,
its
beauty
and
tranquillity
produced
a
soothing
influence
.
 
<EOS>
Evening
was
gradually
stealing
on
,
and
all
the
exquisite
tints
marking
that
delightful
hour
,
were
spreading
over
the
landscape
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
setting
gorgeously
,
and
a
flood
of
radiance
fell
upon
the
old
mansion
beneath
them
,
and
upon
the
grey
and
venerable
church
,
situated
on
a
hill
adjoining
it
.
<EOS>
The
sounds
were
all
in
unison
with
the
hour
,
and
the
lowing
of
cattle
,
the
voices
of
the
husbandmen
returning
from
their
work
,
mingled
with
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
newly
alighted
on
the
high
trees
near
the
church
,
told
them
that
bird
,
man
,
and
beast
were
seeking
their
home
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
But
though
Richard
's
eye
dwelt
upon
the
fair
garden
beneath
him
,
embracing
all
its
terraces
,
green
slopes
,
and
trim
pastures
;
though
it
fell
upon
the
moat
belting
the
hall
like
a
glittering
zone
;
though
it
rested
upon
the
church
tower
;
and
,
roaming
over
the
park
beyond
it
,
finally
settled
upon
the
range
of
hills
bounding
the
horizon
,
which
have
not
inaptly
been
termed
the
English
Apennines
;
though
he
saw
all
these
things
,
he
thought
not
of
them
,
neither
was
he
conscious
of
the
sounds
that
met
his
ear
,
and
which
all
spoke
of
rest
from
labour
,
and
peace
.
<EOS>
Darker
and
deeper
grew
his
melancholy
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
persuade
himself
he
was
not
long
for
this
world
;
and
,
while
gazing
upon
the
beautiful
prospect
before
him
,
was
perhaps
looking
upon
it
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
Dorothy
watched
him
anxiously
,
and
at
last
receiving
no
answer
to
her
questions
,
and
alarmed
by
the
expression
of
his
countenance
,
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
Richard
's
turn
to
console
her
,
and
he
inquired
with
much
anxiety
as
to
the
cause
of
this
sudden
outburst
of
grief
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
yourself
are
the
cause
of
it
,
dear
Richard
,
"
replied
Dorothy
,
regarding
him
with
brimming
eyes
;
"
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
unhappy
.
<EOS>
If
you
suffer
this
melancholy
to
grow
upon
you
,
it
will
affect
both
mind
and
body
.
<EOS>
Just
now
your
countenance
wore
an
expression
most
distressing
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
Try
to
smile
,
dear
Richard
,
if
only
to
cheer
me
,
or
else
I
shall
grow
as
sad
as
you
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
known
the
day
,
and
not
long
since
either
,
when
on
a
pleasant
summer
evening
like
this
you
would
propose
a
stroll
into
the
park
with
me
;
and
,
when
there
,
would
trip
along
the
glades
as
fleetly
as
a
deer
,
and
defy
me
to
catch
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
always
took
care
<EOS>
I
should
,
though
--
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
Come
,
there
is
a
little
attempt
at
a
smile
.
<EOS>
That
's
something
.
<EOS>
You
look
more
like
yourself
now
.
<EOS>
How
happy
we
used
to
be
in
those
days
,
to
be
sure!--and
<EOS>
how
merry
!
<EOS>
You
would
make
the
courts
ring
with
your
blithe
laughter
,
and
wellnigh
kill
me
with
your
jests
.
<EOS>
If
love
is
to
make
one
mope
like
an
owl
,
and
sigh
like
the
wind
through
a
half
-
shut
casement
;
if
it
is
to
cause
one
to
lose
one
's
rosy
complexion
and
gay
spirit
,
and
forget
how
to
dance
and
sing
--
take
no
pleasure
in
hawking
and
hunting
,
or
any
kind
of
sport
--
walk
about
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
,
muttering
,
and
with
disordered
attire
--
if
it
is
to
make
one
silent
when
one
should
be
talkative
,
grave
when
one
should
be
gay
,
heedless
when
one
should
listen
--
if
it
is
to
do
all
this
,
defend
me
from
the
tender
passion
!
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
never
fall
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
never
will
,
dear
Dorothy
,
"
replied
Richard
,
pressing
her
hand
affectionately
,
"
if
your
love
is
to
be
attended
with
such
unhappy
results
as
mine
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
it
is
,
but
I
feel
unusually
despondent
this
evening
,
and
am
haunted
by
a
thousand
dismal
fancies
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
do
my
best
to
dismiss
them
,
and
with
your
help
no
doubt
I
shall
succeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There!--there
was
a
smile
in
earnest
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dorothy
,
brightening
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Richard
!
<EOS>
I
am
quite
happy
now
.
<EOS>
And
after
all
I
do
not
see
why
you
should
take
such
a
gloomy
view
of
things
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
there
is
a
great
deal
,
a
very
great
deal
,
of
happiness
in
store
for
you
and
Alizon
<EOS>
--
I
must
couple
her
name
with
yours
,
or
you
will
not
allow
it
to
be
happiness
--
if
you
can
only
be
brought
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
of
it
;
and
you
shall
see
how
nicely
I
can
make
the
matter
out
.
<EOS>
As
thus
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
is
certain
to
die
soon
--
such
a
wicked
woman
can
not
live
long
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
for
calling
her
wicked
,
Richard
;
but
you
know
I
never
can
forget
her
unhallowed
proceedings
in
the
convent
church
at
Whalley
,
<EOS>
where
I
was
so
nearly
becoming
a
witch
myself
.
<EOS>
Well
,
as
I
was
saying
,
she
can
not
live
long
,
and
when
she
goes
--
and
Heaven
grant
it
may
be
soon!--Alizon
,
no
doubt
,
will
mourn
for
her
though
I
shall
not
,
and
after
a
decent
interval
--
then
,
Richard
,
then
she
will
no
longer
say
you
nay
,
but
will
make
you
happy
as
your
wife
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
do
not
look
so
sad
again
,
dear
brother
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
make
you
quite
cheerful
by
the
picture
I
was
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
I
fear
it
will
never
be
realized
that
I
am
sad
,
Dorothy
,
"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
My
own
anticipations
are
the
opposite
of
yours
,
and
paint
Alizon
sinking
into
an
early
grave
before
her
mother
;
while
as
to
myself
,
if
such
be
the
case
,
I
shall
not
long
survive
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
now
you
will
make
me
weep
again
,
"
cried
Dorothy
,
her
tears
flowing
afresh
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
allow
you
to
indulge
such
gloomy
ideas
,
Richard
.
<EOS>
If
I
seriously
thought
Mistress
Nutter
likely
to
occasion
all
this
fresh
mischief
,
I
would
cause
her
to
be
delivered
up
to
justice
,
and
hanged
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
You
may
look
cross
at
me
,
but
I
would
.
<EOS>
What
is
an
old
witch
like
her
,
compared
with
two
young
handsome
persons
,
dying
for
love
of
each
other
,
and
yet
not
able
to
marry
on
her
account
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dorothy
,
Dorothy
,
you
must
put
some
restraint
on
your
tongue
,
"
said
Richard
;
"
you
give
it
sadly
too
much
licence
.
<EOS>
You
forget
it
is
the
wish
of
the
unhappy
lady
you
refer
to
,
to
expiate
her
offences
at
the
stake
,
and
that
it
is
only
out
of
consideration
to
her
daughter
that
she
has
been
induced
to
remain
in
concealment
.
<EOS>
What
will
be
the
issue
of
it
all
,
I
dare
scarcely
conjecture
.
<EOS>
Wo
to
her
,
I
fear
!
<EOS>
Wo
to
Alizon
!
<EOS>
Wo
to
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
Richard
,
that
you
should
link
yourself
to
her
fate
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Dorothy
,
half
mournfully
,
half
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
it
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
destiny
--
a
deplorable
destiny
,
if
you
will
--
but
not
to
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
That
Mistress
Nutter
will
escape
the
consequences
of
her
crimes
,
I
can
scarcely
believe
.
<EOS>
Her
penitence
is
profound
and
sincere
,
and
that
is
a
great
consolation
;
for
I
trust
she
will
not
perish
,
body
and
soul
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
her
to
have
some
spiritual
assistance
,
but
this
Nicholas
will
not
for
the
present
permit
,
alleging
that
no
churchman
would
consent
to
screen
her
from
justice
when
he
became
aware
,
as
he
must
by
her
confession
,
of
the
nature
and
magnitude
of
her
offences
.
<EOS>
This
may
be
true
;
but
when
the
wretches
who
have
been
leagued
with
her
in
iniquity
are
disposed
of
,
the
reason
will
no
longer
exist
,
and
I
will
see
that
she
is
cared
for
.
<EOS>
But
,
apart
from
her
mother
,
I
have
another
source
of
anxiety
respecting
Alizon
.
<EOS>
It
is
this
:
orders
have
been
this
day
given
for
the
arrest
of
Elizabeth
Device
and
her
daughter
,
Jennet
,
and
Alizon
will
be
the
chief
witness
against
them
.
<EOS>
This
will
be
a
great
trouble
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
,
"
rejoined
Dorothy
,
with
much
concern
.
<EOS>
"
But
can
it
not
be
avoided
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
,
"
said
Richard
,
"
and
I
blamed
Nicholas
much
for
his
precipitancy
in
giving
the
order
;
but
he
replied
he
had
been
held
up
latterly
as
a
favourer
of
witches
,
and
must
endeavour
to
redeem
his
character
by
a
display
of
severity
.
<EOS>
Were
it
not
for
Alizon
,
I
should
rejoice
that
the
noxious
brood
should
at
last
be
utterly
exterminated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
should
I
,
in
good
sooth
,
"
responded
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
Elizabeth
Device
,
she
is
bad
enough
for
any
thing
,
and
capable
of
almost
any
mischief
:
but
she
is
nothing
to
Jennet
,
who
,
I
am
persuaded
,
would
become
a
second
Mother
Demdike
if
her
career
were
not
cut
short
.
<EOS>
You
have
seen
the
child
,
and
know
what
an
ill
-
favoured
,
deformed
little
creature
she
is
,
with
round
high
shoulders
,
eyes
set
strangely
in
her
face
,
and
such
a
malicious
expression
--
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
shudder
to
think
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
,
as
if
to
shut
out
some
unpleasant
object
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
,
predestined
child
of
sin
,
branded
by
nature
from
her
birth
,
and
charged
with
wicked
passions
,
as
the
snake
with
venom
,
I
can
not
but
pity
her
!
"
exclaimed
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Compassion
is
entirely
thrown
away
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
,
and
as
if
trying
to
shake
off
a
weakness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
poisonous
fruit
must
,
however
,
be
nipped
in
the
bud
.
<EOS>
Better
she
should
perish
now
,
even
though
comparatively
guiltless
,
than
hereafter
with
a
soul
stained
with
crime
,
like
her
mother
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
concluded
,
he
put
his
hand
quickly
to
his
side
,
for
a
sharp
and
sudden
pang
shot
through
his
heart
;
and
so
acute
was
the
pain
,
that
,
after
struggling
against
it
for
a
moment
,
he
groaned
deeply
,
and
would
have
fallen
,
if
his
sister
,
greatly
alarmed
,
and
with
difficulty
repressing
a
scream
,
had
not
lent
him
support
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
were
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
little
girl
,
who
had
approached
the
place
where
they
were
sitting
,
with
footsteps
so
light
that
the
grass
scarcely
seemed
to
bend
beneath
them
,
and
who
,
ensconcing
herself
behind
the
tree
,
drank
in
their
discourse
with
eager
ears
.
<EOS>
She
was
attended
by
a
large
black
cat
,
who
,
climbing
the
tree
,
placed
himself
on
a
bough
above
her
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
latter
part
of
the
conversation
,
and
when
it
turned
upon
the
arrest
of
Jennet
and
her
mother
,
the
expression
of
the
child
's
countenance
,
malicious
enough
to
begin
with
,
became
desperately
malignant
,
and
she
was
only
restrained
by
certain
signs
from
the
cat
,
which
appeared
to
be
intelligible
to
her
,
from
some
act
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
At
last
even
this
failed
,
and
before
the
animal
could
descend
and
check
her
,
she
crept
round
the
bole
of
the
tree
,
so
as
to
bring
herself
close
to
Richard
,
and
muttering
a
spell
,
made
one
or
two
passes
behind
his
back
,
touched
him
with
the
point
of
her
finger
,
but
so
lightly
that
he
was
unconscious
of
the
pressure
,
and
then
hastily
retreated
with
the
cat
,
who
glared
furiously
at
her
from
his
flaming
orbs
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
moment
she
touched
him
that
Richard
felt
as
if
an
arrow
were
quivering
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dorothy
's
alarm
was
so
great
that
she
could
not
even
scream
for
assistance
,
and
she
feared
,
if
she
quitted
her
brother
,
he
would
expire
before
her
return
;
but
the
agony
,
though
great
,
was
speedily
over
,
and
as
the
spasm
ceased
,
he
looked
up
,
and
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
strove
to
re
-
assure
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
be
alarmed
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
it
is
nothing
--
a
momentary
faintness
--
that
is
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
damp
upon
his
brow
,
and
the
deathly
hue
of
his
cheek
,
contradicted
the
assertion
,
and
showed
how
much
he
had
endured
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
more
than
momentary
faintness
,
dear
Richard
,
"
replied
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
frightful
seizure
--
so
frightful
that
I
almost
feared
;
but
no
matter
--
you
know
I
am
easily
alarmed
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
<EOS>
here
is
some
colour
coming
into
your
cheeks
.
<EOS>
You
are
better
now
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
Lean
upon
me
,
and
let
us
return
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
walk
unassisted
,
"
said
Richard
,
rising
with
an
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
despise
my
feeble
aid
,
"
replied
Dorothy
,
taking
his
arm
under
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
quite
well
soon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
well
now
,
"
said
Richard
,
halting
after
he
had
advanced
a
few
paces
,
"
<EOS>
The
attack
is
altogether
passed
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
see
Alizon
coming
towards
us
?
<EOS>
Not
a
word
of
this
sudden
seizure
to
her
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
,
Dorothy
?
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
was
soon
close
behind
them
,
and
though
,
in
obedience
to
Richard
's
injunctions
,
no
allusion
was
made
to
his
recent
illness
,
she
at
once
perceived
he
was
suffering
greatly
,
and
with
much
solicitude
inquired
into
the
cause
.
<EOS>
Richard
avoided
giving
a
direct
answer
,
and
,
immediately
entering
upon
Nicholas
's
visit
,
tried
to
divert
her
attention
from
himself
.
 
<EOS>
So
great
a
change
had
been
wrought
in
Alizon
's
appearance
and
manner
during
the
last
few
weeks
,
that
she
could
scarcely
be
recognised
.
<EOS>
Still
beautiful
as
ever
,
her
beauty
had
lost
its
earthly
character
,
and
had
become
in
the
highest
degree
spiritualised
and
refined
.
<EOS>
Humility
of
deportment
and
resignation
of
look
,
blended
with
an
expression
of
religious
fervour
,
gave
her
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
early
martyrs
.
<EOS>
Unremitting
ardour
in
the
pursuance
of
her
devotional
exercises
by
day
,
and
long
vigils
at
night
,
had
worn
down
her
frame
,
and
robbed
it
of
some
of
its
grace
and
fulness
of
outline
;
but
this
attenuation
had
a
charm
of
its
own
,
and
gave
a
touching
interest
to
her
figure
,
which
was
wanting
before
.
<EOS>
If
her
check
was
thinner
and
paler
,
her
eyes
looked
larger
and
brighter
,
and
more
akin
to
the
stars
in
splendour
;
and
if
she
appeared
less
childlike
,
less
joyous
,
less
free
from
care
,
the
want
of
these
qualities
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
increased
gentleness
,
resignation
,
and
serenity
.
 
<EOS>
Deeply
interested
in
all
Richard
told
her
of
her
mother
<EOS>
,
she
was
greatly
concerned
to
hear
of
the
intended
arrest
of
Elizabeth
and
Jennet
Device
,
especially
the
latter
.
<EOS>
For
this
unhappy
and
misguided
child
she
had
once
entertained
the
affection
of
a
sister
,
and
it
could
not
but
be
a
source
of
grief
to
her
to
reflect
upon
her
probable
fate
.
 
<EOS>
Little
more
passed
between
them
,
for
Richard
,
feeling
his
strength
again
fail
him
,
was
anxious
to
reach
the
house
,
and
Dorothy
was
quite
unequal
to
conversation
.
<EOS>
They
parted
at
the
door
,
and
as
Alizon
,
after
taking
leave
of
her
friends
,
turned
to
continue
her
walk
in
the
garden
,
Richard
staggered
into
the
entrance
-
hall
,
and
sank
upon
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
desired
to
be
alone
,
for
she
did
not
wish
to
have
a
witness
to
the
grief
that
overpowered
her
,
and
which
,
when
she
had
gained
a
retired
part
of
the
garden
,
where
she
supposed
herself
free
from
all
observation
,
found
relief
in
a
flood
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
she
was
a
prey
to
violent
and
irrepressible
emotion
,
and
had
scarcely
regained
a
show
of
composure
,
when
she
heard
herself
addressed
,
as
she
thought
,
in
the
voice
of
the
very
child
whose
unlucky
fate
she
was
deploring
.
<EOS>
Looking
round
in
surprise
,
and
seeing
no
one
,
she
began
to
think
fancy
must
have
cheated
her
,
when
a
low
malicious
laugh
,
arising
from
a
shrubbery
near
her
,
convinced
her
that
Jennet
was
hidden
there
.
<EOS>
And
the
next
moment
the
little
girl
stepped
from
out
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
's
first
impulse
was
to
catch
the
child
in
her
arms
,
and
press
her
to
her
bosom
;
but
there
was
something
in
Jennet
's
look
that
deterred
her
,
and
so
embarrassed
her
,
that
she
was
unable
to
bestow
upon
her
the
ordinary
greeting
of
affection
,
or
even
approach
her
.
 
<EOS>
Jennet
seemed
to
enjoy
her
confusion
,
and
laughed
spitefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
dunna
seem
ower
glad
to
see
me
,
sister
Alizon
,
"
said
Jennet
,
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Sister
_
Alizon
!
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
in
the
term
that
now
jarred
upon
the
young
girl
's
ears
,
but
she
strove
to
conquer
the
feeling
,
as
unworthy
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
once
my
sister
,
"
she
thought
,
"
and
shall
be
so
still
.
<EOS>
I
will
save
her
,
if
it
be
possible
.
"
<EOS>
"
Jennet
,
"
she
added
aloud
,
"
I
know
not
what
chance
brings
you
here
,
and
though
I
may
not
give
you
the
welcome
you
expect
,
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
,
because
I
may
be
the
means
of
serving
you
.
<EOS>
Do
not
be
alarmed
at
what
I
am
going
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
The
danger
I
hope
is
passed
,
or
at
all
events
may
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
Your
liberty
is
threatened
,
and
at
the
very
moment
I
see
you
here
I
was
lamenting
your
supposed
condition
as
a
prisoner
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jennet
laughed
louder
and
more
spitefully
than
before
,
and
looked
so
like
a
little
fury
that
Alizon
's
blood
ran
cold
at
the
sight
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey

she
cried

<EOS>
"
How

asked
Alizon
,
greatly
alarmed

<EOS>
"
Yo

replied
Jennet
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

"
rejoined
Alizon
,
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Varry

cried
Jennet
,
with
a
look
of
concentrated
malice
and
fury
;
<EOS>
"

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I

"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Defy

<EOS>
"
screamed
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What

"
 
<EOS>
And
at
the
call
the
huge
black
cat
sprang
from
out
the
shrubbery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tear
her
flesh
from
her
bones

"
cried
the
little
girl
,
pointing
to
Alizon
,
and
stamping
furiously
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Tib
erected
his
back
,
and
glared
like
a
tiger
,
but
he
seemed
unwilling
or
unable
to
obey
the
order
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
,
who
had
completely
recovered
her
courage
,
regarded
him
fixedly
,
and
apparently
without
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whoy

"
cried
the
infuriated
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
He

"
said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
cast

<EOS>
Your

"
 
<EOS>
"
Off

cried
Jennet
,
repelling
her
with
furious
gestures
.
"

"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
sprang
into
the
shrubbery
,
followed
by
the
cat
,
leaving
Alizon
appalled
by
her
frightful
malignity
.

CHAPTER
IV.--THE
GORGE
OF
CLIVIGER
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
had
already
set
as
Nicholas
Assheton
reached
Todmorden
,
then
a
very
small
village
indeed
,
and
alighting
at
a
little
inn
near
the
church
,
found
the
ale
so
good
,
and
so
many
boon
companions
assembled
to
discuss
it
,
that
he
would
fain
have
tarried
with
them
for
an
hour
or
so
;
but
prudence
,
for
once
,
getting
the
better
of
inclination
,
and
suggesting
that
he
had
fifteen
or
sixteen
miles
still
to
ride
,
over
a
rough
and
lonely
road
,
part
of
which
lay
through
the
gorge
of
Cliviger
,
a
long
and
solitary
pass
among
the
English
Apennines
,
and
,
moreover
,
had
a
large
sum
of
money
about
him
,
he
tore
himself
away
by
a
great
effort
.
 
<EOS>
On
quitting
the
smiling
valley
of
Todmorden
,
and
drawing
near
the
dangerous
defile
before
mentioned
,
some
misgivings
crossed
him
,
and
he
almost
reproached
himself
with
foolhardiness
in
venturing
within
it
at
such
an
hour
,
and
wholly
unattended
.
<EOS>
Several
recent
cases
of
robbery
,
some
of
them
attended
by
murder
,
had
occurred
within
the
pass
;
and
these
now
occurred
so
forcibly
to
the
squire
,
that
he
was
half
inclined
to
ride
back
to
Todmorden
,
and
engage
two
or
three
of
the
topers
he
had
left
at
the
inn
to
serve
him
as
an
escort
as
far
as
Burnley
,
but
he
dismissed
the
idea
almost
as
soon
as
formed
,
and
,
casting
one
look
at
the
green
and
woody
slopes
around
him
,
struck
spurs
into
Robin
,
and
dashed
into
the
gorge
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
right
towered
a
precipice
,
on
the
bare
crest
of
which
stood
a
heap
of
stones
piled
like
a
column
--
the
remains
,
probably
,
of
a
cairn
.
<EOS>
On
this
commanding
point
Nicholas
perceived
a
female
figure
,
dilated
to
gigantic
proportions
against
the
sky
,
who
,
as
far
as
he
could
distinguish
,
seemed
watching
him
,
and
making
signs
to
him
,
apparently
to
go
back
;
but
he
paid
little
regard
to
them
,
and
soon
afterwards
lost
sight
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Precipitous
and
almost
inaccessible
rocks
,
of
every
variety
of
form
and
hue
;
some
springing
perpendicularly
up
like
the
spire
of
a
church
,
others
running
along
in
broken
ridges
,
or
presenting
the
appearance
of
high
embattled
walls
<EOS>
;
here
riven
into
deep
gullies
,
there
opening
into
wild
savage
glens
,
fit
spots
for
robber
ambuscade
;
now
presenting
a
fair
smooth
surface
,
now
jagged
,
shattered
,
shelving
,
roughened
with
brushwood
;
sometimes
bleached
and
hoary
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
pinnacled
crag
called
the
White
Kirk
;
sometimes
green
with
moss
or
grey
with
lichen
;
sometimes
,
though
but
rarely
,
shaded
with
timber
,
as
in
the
approach
to
the
cavern
named
the
Earl
's
Bower
;
but
generally
bold
and
naked
,
and
sombre
in
tint
as
the
colours
employed
by
the
savage
Rosa
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
distinguishing
features
of
the
gorge
of
Cliviger
when
Nicholas
traversed
it
.
<EOS>
Now
the
high
embankments
and
mighty
arches
of
a
railway
fill
up
its
recesses
and
span
its
gullies
;
the
roar
of
the
engine
is
heard
where
the
cry
of
the
bird
of
prey
alone
resounded
;
and
clouds
of
steam
usurp
the
place
of
the
mist
-
wreaths
on
its
crags
.
 
<EOS>
Formerly
,
the
high
cliffs
abounded
with
hawks
;
the
rocks
echoed
with
their
yells
and
screeches
,
and
the
spots
adjoining
their
nests
resembled
,
in
the
words
of
the
historian
of
the
district
,
Whitaker
,
"
little
charnel
-
houses
for
the
bones
of
game
.
"
<EOS>
Formerly
,
also
,
on
some
inaccessible
point
built
the
rock
-
eagle
,
and
reared
its
brood
from
year
to
year
.
<EOS>
The
gaunt
wolf
had
once
ravaged
the
glens
,
and
the
sly
fox
and
fierce
cat
-
a
-
mountain
still
harboured
within
them
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
those
the
only
objects
of
dread
.
<EOS>
The
superstitious
declared
the
gorge
was
haunted
by
a
frightful
,
hirsute
demon
,
yclept
Hobthurst
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
savage
character
of
the
ravine
was
relieved
by
some
spots
of
exquisite
beauty
,
where
the
traveller
might
have
lingered
with
delight
,
if
apprehension
of
assault
from
robber
,
or
visit
from
Hobthurst
,
had
not
urged
him
on
.
<EOS>
Numberless
waterfalls
,
gushing
from
fissures
in
the
hills
,
coursed
down
their
seamy
sides
,
looking
like
threads
of
silver
as
they
sprang
from
point
to
point
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
beautiful
of
these
cascades
,
issuing
from
a
gully
in
the
rocks
near
the
cavern
called
the
Earl
's
Bower
,
fell
,
in
rainy
seasons
,
in
one
unbroken
sheet
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
.
<EOS>
Through
the
midst
of
the
gorge
ran
a
swift
and
brawling
stream
,
known
by
the
appellation
of
the
Calder
;
but
it
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
river
flowing
past
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
The
course
of
this
impetuous
current
was
not
always
restrained
within
its
rocky
channel
,
and
when
swollen
by
heavy
rains
,
it
would
frequently
invade
the
narrow
causeway
running
beside
it
,
and
,
spreading
over
the
whole
width
of
the
gorge
,
render
the
road
almost
impassable
.
 
<EOS>
Through
this
rocky
and
sombre
defile
,
and
by
the
side
of
the
brawling
Calder
,
which
dashed
swiftly
past
him
,
Nicholas
took
his
way
.
<EOS>
The
hawks
were
yelling
overhead
;
the
rooks
were
cawing
on
the
topmost
branches
of
some
tall
timber
,
on
which
they
built
;
a
raven
was
croaking
lustily
in
the
wood
;
and
a
pair
of
eagles
were
soaring
in
the
still
glowing
sky
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
the
glen
contracted
,
and
a
wall
of
steep
rocks
on
either
side
hemmed
the
shuddering
traveller
in
.
<EOS>
Instinctively
,
he
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
,
and
accelerated
his
pace
.
 
<EOS>
The
narrow
glen
expands
,
the
precipices
fall
further
back
,
and
the
traveller
breathes
more
freely
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
does
not
relax
his
speed
,
for
his
imagination
has
been
at
work
in
the
gloom
,
peopling
his
path
with
lurking
robbers
or
grinning
boggarts
.
<EOS>
He
begins
to
fear
he
shall
lose
his
gold
,
and
execrates
his
folly
for
incurring
such
heedless
risk
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
too
late
now
to
turn
back
.
 
<EOS>
It
grows
rapidly
dusk
,
and
objects
became
less
and
less
distinct
,
assuming
fantastical
and
fearful
forms
.
<EOS>
A
blasted
tree
,
clinging
to
a
rock
,
and
thrusting
a
bare
branch
across
the
road
,
looks
to
the
squire
like
a
bandit
;
and
a
white
owl
bursting
from
a
bush
,
scares
him
as
if
it
had
been
Hobthurst
himself
.
<EOS>
However
,
in
spite
of
these
and
other
alarms
,
for
which
he
is
indebted
to
excited
fancy
,
he
hurries
on
,
and
is
proceeding
at
a
thundering
pace
,
when
all
at
once
his
horse
comes
to
a
stop
,
arrested
by
a
tall
female
figure
,
resembling
that
seen
near
the
mountain
cairn
at
the
entrance
of
the
gorge
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
's
blood
ran
cold
,
for
though
in
this
case
he
could
not
apprehend
plunder
,
he
was
fearful
of
personal
injury
,
for
he
believed
the
woman
to
be
a
witch
.
<EOS>
Mustering
up
courage
,
however
,
he
forced
Robin
to
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
progress
was
meant
to
be
barred
,
a
better
spot
for
the
purpose
could
not
have
been
selected
.
<EOS>
A
narrow
road
,
scarcely
two
feet
in
width
,
ran
round
the
ledge
of
a
tremendous
crag
,
jutting
so
far
into
the
glen
that
it
almost
met
the
steep
barrier
of
rocks
opposite
it
.
<EOS>
Between
these
precipitous
crags
dashed
the
river
in
a
foaming
cascade
,
nearly
twelve
feet
in
height
,
and
the
steep
narrow
causeway
winding
beside
it
,
as
above
described
,
was
rendered
excessively
slippery
and
dangerous
from
the
constant
cloud
of
spray
arising
from
the
fall
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
highest
and
narrowest
point
of
the
ledge
,
and
occupying
nearly
the
whole
of
its
space
,
with
an
overhanging
rock
on
one
side
of
her
,
and
a
roaring
torrent
on
the
other
,
stood
the
tall
woman
,
determined
apparently
,
from
her
attitude
and
deportment
,
to
oppose
the
squire
's
further
progress
.
<EOS>
As
Nicholas
advanced
,
he
became
convinced
that
it
was
the
same
person
he
had
seen
near
the
cairn
;
but
,
when
her
features
grew
distinguishable
,
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
it
was
Nance
Redferne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
<EOS>
Nance
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
What

you

,

"
 
<EOS>
"
Cum

she
replied
;

<EOS>
"
In

my

"
demanded
the
squire
uneasily
.
 
<EOS>
"
O

,
and
plundered

"
replied
Nance
;

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed

exclaimed
Nicholas
;
"
they
will
get

for
their

<EOS>
I

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Dunna

Nance
;

<EOS>
"
I

Nance

"
replied
the
squire
;
"
quite
the
contrary

<EOS>
But
how
the
devil
should
these
rascals
expect
me
?
<EOS>
And
,
above
all
,
how
should
they
conjecture
I

come
so
well
provided

<EOS>
For

sooth

such

not

<EOS>
"
There

cried
Nicholas
;
"

I

in

rage

"
I

"
And

the
squire
--
new
lights
breaking
upon
him
,
"
I

<EOS>
He

cried
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
But
is
he
one
of

ambuscade

"
 
<EOS>
Nance
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
will
confront

I

pursued
Nicholas

griping

of

<EOS>

What

cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is

"
 
<EOS>
"
Maybe
yo
ha
heerd
tell
that
Mother
Demdike
had
a
son

a
dowter

replied
Nance
;
"
the
dowter
bein
'
,
of
course
,
Elizabeth
Device
;
and
the
son

Christopher
Demdike

being
supposed

be
dead

<EOS>
Howsomever
,
this
is
not
the
case

for
<EOS>
Lawrence
Fogg
is
he
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
guessed
as
much
when
you
began
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
a
cursedly
bad
look
about
the
eyes
--
a
damned
Demdike
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
What
an
infernal
villain
the
fellow
must
be
!
<EOS>
without
a
jot
of
natural
feeling
.
<EOS>
Why
,
he
has
this
very
day
assisted
at
his
nephew
's
capture
,
and
caused
his
own
sister
to
be
arrested
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
have
been
properly
duped
!
<EOS>
To
lodge
a
son
of
that
infernal
hag
in
my
house

feed
him

clothe
him

,
make
him
my

take
him

the
viper
!
<EOS>
to
my
bosom
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
rightly
served
.
<EOS>
But
he
shall
hang!--he
shall
hang
!
<EOS>
That
is
some
consolation
,
though
slight
.
<EOS>
But
how
do
you
know
all
this
,
Nance
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dunna

<EOS>
An

Malkin
Tower

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Malkin
Tower
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
squire
,
in
fresh
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
have
these
robbers
taken
up
their
quarters
there
?
<EOS>
This
accounts
for
all
the
strange
sights
said
to
have
been
seen
there
of
late
,
and
which
I
treated
as
mere
fables
.
<EOS>
But
,
ah
!
a
terrible
thought
crosses
me
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
will
be
there
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
sent
her
.
<EOS>
Death
and
destruction
!
<EOS>
she
will
fall
into
their
hands
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
there
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
take
any
assistance
with
me
.
<EOS>
That
would
betray
the
poor
lady
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
yo'n
trust
me
,
ey'n
help
yo
through
the
difficulty
,
"
replied
Nance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
up
then
quickly
,
lass
,
since
it
must
be
so
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
he
moved
forward
,
and
giving
her
his
hand
,
she
was
instantly
seated
behind
him
upon
Robin
,
who
seemed
no
way
incommoded
by
his
double
burthen
,
but
dashed
down
the
further
side
of
the
causeway
,
in
answer
to
a
sharp
application
of
the
spur
.
<EOS>
Passing
her
arms
round
the
squire
's
waist
,
Nance
maintained
her
seat
well
;
and
in
this
way
they
rattled
along
,
heedless
of
the
increasing
difficulties
of
the
road
,
or
the
fast
-
gathering
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
The
mile
was
quickly
passed
,
and
Nance
whispered
in
the
squire
's
ear
that
they
were
approaching
the
Boulder
Stones
.
<EOS>
Presently
they
came
to
a
narrow
glen
,
half
-
filled
with
huge
rocky
fragments
,
detached
from
the
toppling
precipices
on
either
side
,
and
forming
an
admirable
place
of
ambuscade
.
<EOS>
One
rock
,
larger
than
the
rest
,
completely
commanded
the
pass
,
and
,
as
the
squire
advanced
,
a
thundering
voice
from
it
called
to
him
to
stay
;
and
the
injunction
being
disregarded
,
the
barrel
of
a
gun
was
protruded
from
the
bushes
covering
its
brow
,
and
a
shot
fired
at
him
.
<EOS>
Though
well
aimed
,
the
ball
struck
the
ground
beneath
his
horse
's
feet
,
and
Nicholas
continued
his
way
unmoved
,
while
the
faulty
marksman
jumped
down
the
crag
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
four
other
men
started
from
their
places
of
concealment
behind
the
stones
,
and
,
levelling
their
calivers
at
the
fugitives
,
fired
.
<EOS>
The
sharp
discharges
echoed
along
the
gorge
,
and
the
shots
rattled
against
the
rocks
,
but
none
of
them
took
effect
,
and
Nicholas
might
have
gone
on
without
further
hindrance
;
but
,
despite
Nance
's
remonstrances
,
who
urged
him
to
go
on
,
he
pulled
up
to
await
the
coming
of
the
person
who
had
first
challenged
him
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
an
instant
elapsed
before
he
was
beside
the
squire
,
and
presented
a
petronel
at
his
head
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
gloom
,
Nicholas
recognised
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
is
it
thou
,
accursed
traitor
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
scarcely
believe
in
thy
villainy
,
but
now
I
am
convinced
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
jade
you
have
got
behind
you
has
told
you
who
I
am
,
I
see
,
"
replied
Fogg
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
settle
with
her
anon
.
<EOS>
But
this
will
save
further
explanations
with
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
discharged
the
petronel
full
at
the
squire
.
<EOS>
But
the
ball
rebounded
,
as
if
his
doublet
had
been
quilted
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
fact
lined
with
gold
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
squire
unhurt
,
the
robber
captain
uttered
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
you
see
,
perfidious
villain
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
yet
to
render
an
account
of
all
the
wrongs
you
have
done
me
,
but
meantime
you
shall
not
pass
unpunished
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
snatched
the
petronel
from
Fogg
,
and
with
the
but
-
end
dealt
him
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
head
,
felling
him
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
other
robbers
had
descended
from
the
rocks
,
and
,
seeing
the
fall
of
their
leader
,
rushed
forward
to
avenge
him
,
but
Nicholas
did
not
tarry
for
any
further
encounter
;
but
,
fully
satisfied
with
what
he
had
done
,
struck
spurs
into
Robin
,
and
galloped
off
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
he
could
hear
the
shouts
of
the
men
,
but
they
soon
afterwards
died
away
.
 
<EOS>
Little
more
than
half
the
ravine
had
been
traversed
when
the
rencounter
above
described
took
place
;
but
,
though
the
road
was
still
difficult
and
dangerous
,
and
rendered
doubly
so
by
the
obscurity
,
no
further
hindrance
occurred
till
just
as
Nicholas
was
quitting
the
gloomy
intricacies
of
the
gorge
,
and
approaching
the
more
open
country
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
At
this
point
Robin
fell
,
throwing
both
him
and
Nance
,
and
when
the
animal
rose
again
<EOS>
he
was
found
to
be
so
much
injured
that
it
was
impossible
to
mount
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
resource
but
to
proceed
to
Burnley
,
which
was
still
three
or
four
miles
distant
,
on
foot
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
,
Nance
volunteered
to
provide
the
squire
with
another
steed
,
but
he
resolutely
refused
the
offer
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
--
none
of
your
broomsticks
for
me
,
"
he
cried
;
"
no
devil
's
horses
--
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
they
may
carry
me
.
<EOS>
My
own
legs
must
serve
me
now
.
<EOS>
I
'll
just
take
poor
Robin
out
of
the
road
,
and
then
trudge
off
for
Burnley
as
fast
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
led
the
horse
to
a
small
green
mead
skirting
the
stream
,
and
taking
off
his
saddle
and
bridle
,
and
depositing
them
carefully
under
a
tree
,
he
patted
the
animal
on
the
neck
,
promising
to
return
for
him
on
the
morrow
,
and
then
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
,
with
Nance
walking
beside
him
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
gone
far
,
however
,
when
the
clattering
of
hoofs
was
heard
behind
them
,
and
it
was
evident
that
several
horsemen
were
rapidly
approaching
.
<EOS>
Nance
stopped
,
listened
for
a
moment
,
and
then
declaring
that
it
was
Demdike
and
his
band
in
pursuit
,
seized
the
squire
's
arm
and
drew
him
out
of
the
road
,
and
under
the
shelter
of
some
bushes
of
hazel
.
<EOS>
The
robber
captain
could
only
have
been
stunned
,
it
appeared
;
and
,
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
,
had
mounted
his
horse
,
which
was
concealed
,
with
those
of
his
men
,
behind
the
rocks
,
and
started
after
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
construction
put
upon
the
matter
by
Nance
,
and
the
event
proved
it
correct
.
<EOS>
A
loud
shout
from
the
horsemen
,
and
a
sudden
halt
,
proclaimed
that
poor
Robin
had
been
discovered
;
and
this
circumstance
seemed
to
give
great
satisfaction
to
Demdike
,
who
loudly
declared
that
they
were
now
sure
of
overtaking
the
runaways
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
can
not
be
far
off
,
"
he
cried
;
"
but
they
will
most
likely
attempt
to
hide
themselves
,
so
look
well
about
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
rode
on
,
and
it
was
evident
from
the
noise
,
that
the
men
implicitly
obeyed
his
injunctions
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
was
found
,
and
ere
many
minutes
Demdike
came
up
,
and
glancing
at
the
hazels
,
behind
which
the
fugitives
were
hidden
,
he
discharged
a
petronel
into
the
largest
tree
,
but
as
no
movement
followed
the
report
,
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
saw
something
move
here
,
but
I
suppose
I
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
they
have
got
on
further
than
we
expected
,
or
have
retired
into
some
of
the
cloughs
,
in
which
case
it
will
be
useless
to
search
for
them
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
will
make
sure
of
them
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
Two
of
you
shall
form
an
ambuscade
near
Holme
and
two
further
on
within
half
a
mile
of
Burnley
,
and
shall
remain
on
the
watch
till
dawn
,
so
that
you
will
be
sure
to
capture
them
,
and
when
taken
,
make
away
with
them
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
Unless
my
skull
had
been
of
the
strongest
,
that
butcherly
squire
would
have
cracked
it
,
so
he
shall
have
no
grace
from
me
;
and
as
to
that
treacherous
witch
,
Nance
Redferne
,
she
deserves
death
at
our
hands
,
and
she
shall
have
her
deserts
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
suspected
her
,
and
,
indeed
,
was
a
fool
to
trust
one
of
the
vile
Chattox
brood
,
who
are
all
my
natural
enemies
--
but
no
matter
,
I
shall
have
my
revenge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
men
having
promised
compliance
with
their
captain
's
command
,
he
went
on--
 
"
<EOS>
As
to
myself
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
shall
go
forthwith
,
and
as
fast
as
my
horse
can
carry
me
,
to
Malkin
Tower
,
and
I
will
tell
you
why
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
dislike
the
game
we
are
upon
,
but
I
have
better
to
play
just
now
.
<EOS>
Tom
Shaw
,
the
cock
-
master
at
Downham
,
who
is
in
my
pay
,
rode
over
to
Whalley
this
afternoon
,
to
bring
me
word
that
a
certain
lady
,
who
has
long
been
concealed
in
the
Manor
-
house
,
will
be
taken
to
Malkin
Tower
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
The
intelligence
is
certain
,
for
he
had
obtained
it
from
Old
Crouch
,
the
huntsman
,
who
is
to
escort
her
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
Mistress
Nutter
,
for
you
all
know
whom
I
mean
,
will
fall
naturally
into
our
hands
,
and
we
can
wring
any
sums
of
money
we
like
out
of
her
;
for
though
she
has
abandoned
her
property
to
her
daughter
,
Alizon
,
she
can
no
doubt
have
as
much
as
she
wants
,
and
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
she
asks
for
plenty
,
or
I
will
try
the
effect
of
some
of
those
instruments
of
torture
which
I
was
lucky
enough
to
find
in
the
dungeons
of
Malkin
Tower
,
and
which
were
used
for
a
like
purpose
by
my
predecessor
,
Blackburn
,
the
freebooter
.
<EOS>
Are
you
content
,
my
lads
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
Captain
Demdike
,
"
they
replied
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
whole
party
set
forward
,
and
were
speedily
out
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
thought
it
prudent
to
come
forth
,
the
squire
and
Nance
emerged
from
their
place
of
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
?
"
exclaimed
the
former
,
who
was
almost
in
a
state
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
villain
has
announced
his
intention
of
going
to
Malkin
Tower
,
and
Mistress
Nutter
will
assuredly
fall
into
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
could
stop
him
,
or
get
there
before
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
shan
,
if
yo
like
to
ride
wi
'
me
,
"
said
Nance
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
how
--
in
what
way
?
"
asked
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
that
to
me
,
"
replied
Nance
,
breaking
off
a
long
branch
of
hazel
.
"
<EOS>
Tak
howld
o
'
this
,
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
The
squire
obeyed
,
and
was
instantly
carried
off
his
legs
,
and
whisked
through
the
air
at
a
prodigious
rate
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
giddy
and
confused
,
but
did
not
dare
to
leave
go
,
lest
he
should
be
dashed
in
pieces
,
while
Nance
's
wild
laughter
rang
in
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
bleached
and
perpendicular
crag
--
startling
the
eagle
from
his
eyry
--
over
the
yawning
gully
with
the
torrent
roaring
beneath
him
--
over
the
sharp
ridges
of
the
hill
--
over
Townley
park
--
over
Burnley
steeple
--
over
the
wide
valley
beyond
,
he
went
--
until
at
last
,
bewildered
,
out
of
breath
,
and
like
one
in
a
dream
,
he
alighted
on
a
brown
,
bare
,
heathy
expanse
,
and
within
a
hundred
yards
of
a
tall
,
circular
stone
structure
,
which
he
knew
to
be
Malkin
Tower
.

CHAPTER
V.--THE
END
OF
MALKIN
TOWER
.
  
<EOS>
The
shades
of
night
had
fallen
on
Downham
manor
-
house
,
and
with
an
aching
heart
,
and
a
strong
presentiment
of
ill
,
Mistress
Nutter
prepared
to
quit
the
little
chamber
which
had
sheltered
her
for
more
than
two
months
,
and
where
she
would
willingly
have
breathed
her
latest
sigh
,
if
it
had
been
so
permitted
her
.
<EOS>
Closing
the
Bible
<EOS>
she
had
been
reading
,
she
placed
the
sacred
volume
under
her
arm
,
and
taking
up
a
small
bundle
,
containing
her
slender
preparations
for
travel
,
extinguished
the
taper
,
and
then
descending
by
a
secret
staircase
,
passed
through
a
door
,
fashioned
externally
like
a
cupboard
,
and
entered
a
summer
-
house
,
where
she
found
old
Crouch
awaiting
her
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
whispered
words
only
passed
between
her
and
the
huntsman
,
and
informing
her
that
the
horses
were
in
waiting
at
the
back
of
the
garden
<EOS>
,
he
took
the
bundle
from
her
,
and
would
fain
have
relieved
her
also
of
the
Bible
,
but
she
would
not
part
with
it
,
and
pressing
it
more
closely
to
her
bosom
,
said
she
was
quite
ready
to
attend
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
,
starlight
night
;
the
air
soft
and
balmy
,
and
laden
with
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
.
<EOS>
A
nightingale
was
singing
plaintively
in
an
adjoining
tree
,
and
presently
came
a
response
equally
tender
from
another
part
of
the
grove
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
could
not
choose
but
listen
,
and
the
melody
so
touched
her
that
she
was
half
suffocated
by
repressed
emotion
,
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
relief
of
tears
was
denied
her
.
 
<EOS>
Motioning
her
somewhat
impatiently
to
come
on
,
Crouch
struck
into
a
sombre
alley
,
edged
by
clipped
yew
-
trees
,
and
terminating
in
a
plantation
,
through
which
a
winding
path
led
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
<EOS>
whereon
the
mansion
was
situated
.
<EOS>
By
daylight
this
was
a
beautiful
walk
,
affording
exquisite
glimpses
through
the
trees
of
the
surrounding
scenery
,
and
commanding
a
noble
view
of
Pendle
Hill
,
the
dominant
point
in
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
But
even
now
to
the
poor
lady
,
so
long
immured
in
her
cell
-
like
chamber
,
and
deprived
of
many
of
nature
's
choicest
blessings
,
it
appeared
delightful
.
<EOS>
The
fresh
air
,
redolent
of
new
-
mown
hay
,
fanned
her
pale
cheek
and
feverish
brow
,
and
allayed
her
agitation
and
excitement
.
<EOS>
The
perfect
stillness
,
broken
only
by
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
in
the
adjoining
pastures
,
by
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
dor
-
fly
,
or
the
rippling
of
the
beck
in
the
valley
,
further
calmed
her
;
and
the
soothing
influence
was
completed
by
a
contemplation
of
the
serene
heavens
,
wherein
were
seen
the
starry
host
,
with
the
thin
bright
crescent
of
the
new
moon
in
the
midst
of
them
,
diffusing
a
pearly
light
around
her
.
<EOS>
One
blot
alone
appeared
in
the
otherwise
smiling
sky
,
and
this
was
a
great
,
ugly
,
black
cloud
lowering
over
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
noticed
the
portentous
cloud
,
and
noticed
also
its
shadow
on
the
hill
,
which
might
have
been
cast
by
the
Fiend
himself
,
so
like
was
it
to
a
demoniacal
shape
with
outstretched
wings
;
but
,
though
shuddering
at
the
idea
it
suggested
,
she
would
not
suffer
it
to
obtain
possession
of
her
mind
,
but
resolutely
fixed
her
attention
on
other
and
more
pleasing
objects
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
and
a
gate
admitted
them
to
a
road
running
by
the
side
of
Downham
beck
.
<EOS>
Here
they
found
the
horses
in
charge
of
a
man
in
the
dark
red
livery
of
Nicholas
Assheton
,
and
who
was
no
other
than
Tom
Shaw
,
the
rascally
cock
-
master
.
<EOS>
Delivering
the
bridles
to
Crouch
,
the
knave
hastily
strode
away
,
but
he
lingered
at
a
little
distance
to
see
the
lady
mount
;
and
then
leaping
the
hedge
,
struck
through
the
plantation
towards
the
hall
,
chinking
the
money
in
his
pockets
as
he
went
,
and
thinking
how
cleverly
he
had
earned
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
go
unpunished
;
for
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
record
that
,
in
walking
through
the
woods
,
he
was
caught
in
a
gin
placed
there
by
Crouch
,
which
held
him
fast
in
its
iron
teeth
till
morning
,
when
he
was
discovered
by
one
of
the
under
-
keepers
while
going
his
rounds
,
in
a
deplorable
condition
,
and
lamed
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
unconscious
either
of
the
manner
in
which
she
had
been
betrayed
,
or
of
the
punishment
awaiting
her
betrayer
,
Mistress
Nutter
followed
her
conductor
in
silence
.
<EOS>
For
a
while
the
road
continued
by
the
side
of
the
brook
,
and
then
quitting
it
,
commenced
a
long
and
tedious
ascent
,
running
between
high
banks
fringed
with
trees
.
<EOS>
The
overhanging
boughs
rendered
it
so
dark
that
Mistress
Nutter
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
old
huntsman
,
though
he
was
not
many
yards
in
advance
of
her
,
but
she
heard
the
tramp
of
his
horse
,
and
that
was
enough
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
where
the
boughs
were
thickest
,
and
the
road
darkest
,
she
perceived
a
small
fiery
object
on
the
bank
,
and
in
her
alarm
called
out
to
the
huntsman
,
who
,
looking
back
for
a
moment
,
laughed
,
and
told
her
not
to
be
uneasy
,
for
it
was
only
a
glow
-
worm
.
<EOS>
Ashamed
of
her
idle
fears
she
rode
on
,
but
had
not
proceeded
far
,
when
,
looking
again
at
the
bank
,
she
saw
it
studded
with
the
same
lights
.
<EOS>
This
time
she
did
not
call
out
or
scream
,
but
gazed
steadily
at
the
twinkling
fires
,
hoping
to
get
the
better
of
her
fears
.
<EOS>
Her
alarm
,
however
,
rose
to
absolute
terror
,
as
she
beheld
the
glow
-
worms
--
if
glow
-
worms
they
were
--
twist
together
and
form
themselves
into
a
flaming
brand
,
such
as
she
had
seen
in
her
vision
,
grasped
by
the
angel
who
had
driven
her
from
the
gates
of
Paradise
.
 
<EOS>
Averting
her
gaze
,
she
would
have
hastened
on
,
but
a
hand
suddenly
laid
upon
her
bridle
,
held
back
her
horse
;
and
she
then
perceived
a
tall
dark
man
,
mounted
on
a
sable
steed
,
riding
beside
her
.
<EOS>
The
supernatural
character
of
the
horseman
was
manifest
,
inasmuch
as
no
sound
was
caused
by
the
tread
of
his
steed
,
nor
did
he
appear
to
be
visible
to
Crouch
when
the
latter
looked
back
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
maintained
her
seat
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
well
knew
who
was
her
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Soh
,
Alice
Nutter
,
"
said
the
horseman
at
length
,
in
a
low
deep
tone
,
"
you
have
chosen
to
shut
yourself
up
in
a
narrow
cell
,
like
a
recluse
,
for
more
than
two
months
,
denying
yourself
all
sort
of
enjoyment
,
practising
severest
abstinence
,
and
passing
your
whole
time
in
useless
prayer
--
ay
,
useless
,
for
if
you
were
to
pray
from
now
till
doomsday
--
come
when
it
will
,
a
thousand
years
hence
,
or
to
-
morrow
--
it
will
not
save
you
.
<EOS>
When
you
signed
that
bond
to
my
master
,
sentence
was
recorded
against
you
,
and
no
power
can
recall
it
.
<EOS>
Why
,
then
,
these
unavailing
lamentations
?
<EOS>
Why
utter
prayers
which
are
rejected
,
and
supplications
which
are
scorned
?
<EOS>
Shake
off
this
weakness
,
Alice
,
and
be
yourself
again
.
<EOS>
Once
you
had
pride
enough
,
and
a
little
of
it
would
now
be
of
service
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
would
then
see
the
folly
of
this
abject
conduct
--
humbling
yourself
to
the
dust
only
to
be
spurned
,
and
suing
for
mercy
only
to
be
derided
.
<EOS>
Pray
as
loud
and
as
long
as
you
will
,
the
ears
of
Heaven
will
remain
ever
deaf
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
otherwise
,
"
rejoined
the
lady
,
meekly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
deceive
yourself
,
"
replied
the
horseman
.
<EOS>
"
The
term
granted
you
by
your
compact
will
not
be
abridged
,
but
it
is
your
own
fault
if
it
be
not
extended
.
<EOS>
Your
daughter
is
destroying
herself
in
the
vain
hope
of
saving
you
.
<EOS>
Her
prayers
are
unavailing
as
your
own
,
and
recoil
from
the
Judgment
Throne
unheard
.
<EOS>
The
youth
upon
whom
her
affections
are
fixed
is
stricken
with
a
deadly
ailment
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
your
power
to
save
them
both
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
groaned
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
in
your
power
,
I
say
,
to
save
them
,
"
continued
the
horseman
,
"
by
returning
to
your
allegiance
to
your
master
.
<EOS>
He
will
forgive
your
disobedience
if
you
prove
yourself
zealous
in
his
service
;
will
restore
you
to
your
former
worldly
position
;
avenge
you
of
your
enemies
;
and
accomplish
all
you
may
desire
with
respect
to
your
daughter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
do
it
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
not
!
"
echoed
the
horseman
.
<EOS>
"
Try
him
!
<EOS>
For
many
years
I
have
served
you
as
familiar
;
and
you
have
never
set
me
the
task
I
have
failed
to
execute
.
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
become
your
servant
again
,
and
to
offer
you
a
yet
larger
range
of
control
.
<EOS>
Put
no
limits
to
your
desires
or
ambition
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
tired
of
this
narrow
sphere
,
take
a
wider
.
<EOS>
Look
abroad
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
shut
yourself
up
in
a
narrow
cell
,
and
persuade
yourself
you
are
accomplishing
your
ultimate
deliverance
,
when
you
are
only
wasting
precious
time
,
which
might
be
more
advantageously
and
far
more
agreeably
employed
.
<EOS>
While
laughing
at
your
folly
,
my
master
deplores
it
;
and
he
has
,
therefore
,
sent
me
as
to
one
for
whom
notwithstanding
all
derelictions
from
duty
,
he
has
still
a
regard
,
with
an
offer
of
full
forgiveness
,
provided
you
return
to
him
at
once
,
and
renew
your
covenant
,
proving
your
sincerity
by
casting
from
you
the
book
you
hold
under
your
arm
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
snares
are
not
laid
subtle
enough
to
catch
me
,
"
replied
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
part
with
this
holy
volume
,
which
is
my
present
safeguard
,
and
on
which
I
build
my
hopes
of
salvation
--
hopes
which
your
very
proposals
have
revived
in
my
breast
;
for
I
am
well
assured
your
master
would
not
make
them
if
he
felt
confident
of
his
power
over
me
.
<EOS>
No
;
I
defy
him
and
you
,
and
I
command
you
in
Heaven
's
name
to
get
hence
,
and
to
tempt
me
no
longer
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
words
were
uttered
,
with
a
howl
of
rage
and
mortification
,
like
the
roar
of
a
wild
beast
,
the
dark
horseman
and
his
steed
vanished
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
sound
,
Crouch
stopped
,
and
questioned
the
lady
as
to
its
cause
;
but
receiving
no
satisfactory
explanation
from
her
,
he
bade
her
ride
quickly
on
,
affirming
it
must
be
the
boggart
of
the
clough
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
they
again
came
upon
Downham
beck
,
and
were
about
to
cross
it
,
when
their
purpose
was
arrested
by
a
joyous
barking
,
and
the
next
moment
Grip
came
up
.
<EOS>
The
dog
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
shut
up
in
the
stable
,
his
company
not
being
desired
on
the
expedition
;
but
contriving
in
some
way
or
other
to
get
out
,
he
had
scented
his
master
's
course
,
and
in
the
end
overtaken
him
.
<EOS>
Crouch
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
or
pleased
,
and
at
first
gave
utterance
to
an
oath
,
and
raised
his
whip
to
chastise
him
,
but
almost
instantly
the
latter
feeling
predominated
,
and
he
welcomed
the
faithful
animal
with
a
few
kind
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
suppose
theaw
thowt
ey
couldna
do
without
thee
,
Grip
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
mayhap
theaw'rt
reet
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
are
now
across
the
beck
,
and
speeding
over
the
wide
brown
waste
.
<EOS>
The
huntsman
warily
shapes
his
course
so
as
to
avoid
any
limestone
-
quarries
or
turf
-
pits
.
<EOS>
He
points
out
a
jack
-
o'-lantern
dancing
merrily
on
the
surface
of
a
dangerous
morass
,
and
tells
a
dismal
tale
of
a
traveller
lured
into
it
by
the
delusive
light
,
and
swallowed
up
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
pays
little
heed
to
him
,
but
ever
and
anon
looks
back
,
as
if
in
dread
of
some
one
behind
her
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
is
visible
,
and
she
only
sees
the
great
black
cloud
still
hovering
over
Pendle
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
On
--
on
--
they
go
;
their
horses
'
hoofs
now
splashing
through
the
wet
sod
,
now
beating
upon
the
firm
but
elastic
turf
.
<EOS>
A
merry
ride
it
would
be
if
their
errand
were
different
,
and
their
hearts
free
from
care
.
<EOS>
The
air
is
fresh
and
reviving
,
and
the
rapid
motion
exhilarating
.
<EOS>
The
stars
shine
out
,
and
the
crescent
moon
is
still
glittering
in
the
heavens
,
but
the
black
cloud
hangs
motionless
on
Pendle
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Now
<EOS>
and
then
some
bird
of
night
flies
past
them
,
and
they
hear
the
whooping
of
the
owl
,
and
see
him
skimming
like
a
ghost
over
the
waste
.
<EOS>
Then
more
fen
fires
arise
,
showing
that
other
treacherous
quagmires
are
at
hand
;
but
Crouch
skirts
them
safely
.
<EOS>
Now
the
bull
-
frog
croaks
in
the
marsh
,
and
a
deep
booming
tells
of
a
bittern
passing
by
.
<EOS>
They
see
the
mighty
bird
above
them
,
with
his
wide
heavy
wings
and
long
neck
.
<EOS>
Grip
howls
at
him
,
but
is
instantly
checked
by
his
master
,
and
they
gallop
on
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
now
by
the
side
of
Pendle
Water
,
and
within
sight
of
Rough
Lee
.
<EOS>
What
tumultuous
thoughts
agitate
the
lady
's
breast
!
<EOS>
The
ground
she
tramples
on
was
once
her
own
;
the
woods
by
the
river
side
were
planted
by
her
;
the
mansion
before
her
once
owned
her
as
mistress
,
and
now
she
dares
not
approach
it
.
<EOS>
Nor
does
she
desire
to
do
so
,
for
the
sight
of
it
brings
back
terrible
recollections
,
and
fills
her
again
with
despair
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
now
close
upon
it
,
and
it
appears
dark
,
silent
,
and
deserted
.
<EOS>
How
different
from
what
it
was
of
yore
in
her
husband
's
days
--
the
husband
she
had
foully
slain
!
<EOS>
Speed
on
,
old
huntsman!--lash
your
panting
horse
,
or
the
remorseful
lady
will
far
outstrip
you
,
for
she
rides
as
if
the
avenging
furies
were
at
her
heels
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
rattling
over
the
bridge
,
and
<EOS>
Crouch
,
toiling
after
her
,
and
with
Grip
toiling
after
him
,
shouts
to
her
to
moderate
her
pace
.
<EOS>
She
looks
back
,
and
beholds
the
grim
old
house
frowning
full
upon
her
,
and
hurries
on
.
<EOS>
Huntsman
and
dog
are
left
behind
for
awhile
,
but
the
steep
ascent
soon
compels
her
to
slacken
speed
,
and
they
come
up
,
Crouch
swearing
lustily
,
and
Grip
,
with
his
tongue
out
of
his
mouth
,
<EOS>
limping
as
if
foot
-
sore
.
 
<EOS>
The
road
now
leads
through
a
thicket
.
<EOS>
The
horses
stumble
frequently
,
for
the
stones
are
loose
,
and
the
footing
consequently
uncertain
.
<EOS>
Crouch
has
a
fall
,
and
ere
he
can
remount
the
lady
is
gone
.
<EOS>
It
is
useless
to
hurry
after
her
,
and
he
is
proceeding
slowly
,
when
Grip
,
who
is
a
little
in
advance
,
growls
fiercely
,
and
looks
back
at
his
master
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
danger
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
The
huntsman
presses
on
,
but
he
is
too
late
,
if
,
indeed
,
he
could
at
any
time
have
rendered
effectual
assistance
.
<EOS>
A
clearing
in
the
thicket
shows
him
the
lady
dismounted
,
and
surrounded
by
several
wild
-
looking
men
armed
with
calivers
.
<EOS>
Part
of
the
band
bear
her
shrieking
off
,
and
the
rest
fire
at
him
,
but
without
effect
,
and
then
chase
him
as
far
as
the
steepest
part
of
the
hill
,
down
which
he
dashes
,
followed
by
Grip
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
bottom
,
he
pauses
to
listen
if
he
is
pursued
,
and
hearing
nothing
further
to
alarm
him
,
debates
with
himself
what
is
best
to
be
done
;
and
,
not
liking
to
alarm
the
village
,
for
that
would
be
to
betray
Mistress
Nutter
,
he
gets
off
his
horse
,
ties
him
to
a
tree
,
and
with
Grip
close
at
his
heels
,
commences
the
ascent
of
the
hill
by
a
different
road
from
that
he
had
previously
taken
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mistress
Nutter
's
captors
dragged
her
forcibly
towards
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Their
arms
and
appearance
left
her
no
doubt
they
were
depredators
,
and
she
sought
to
convince
them
she
had
neither
money
nor
valuables
in
her
possession
.
<EOS>
They
laughed
at
her
assertions
,
but
made
no
other
reply
.
<EOS>
Her
sole
consolation
was
,
that
they
did
not
seek
to
deprive
her
of
her
Bible
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
tower
,
a
signal
was
given
by
one
of
the
foremost
of
the
band
,
and
the
steps
being
lowered
from
the
high
doorway
,
she
was
compelled
to
ascend
them
,
and
being
pushed
along
a
short
passage
,
obscured
by
a
piece
of
thick
tapestry
,
but
which
was
drawn
aside
as
she
advanced
,
she
found
herself
in
a
circular
chamber
,
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
massive
table
covered
with
flasks
and
drinking
-
cups
,
and
stained
with
wine
.
<EOS>
From
the
roof
,
which
was
crossed
by
great
black
beams
of
oak
,
was
suspended
a
lamp
with
three
burners
,
whose
light
showed
that
the
walls
were
garnished
with
petronels
,
rapiers
,
poniards
,
and
other
murderous
weapons
;
besides
these
there
were
hung
from
pegs
long
riding
-
cloaks
,
sombreros
,
vizards
,
and
other
robber
accoutrements
,
including
a
variety
of
disguises
,
from
the
clown
's
frieze
jerkin
to
the
gentleman
's
velvet
doublet
,
ready
to
be
assumed
on
an
emergency
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
was
an
open
valise
,
or
a
pair
of
saddle
-
bags
with
their
contents
strewn
about
the
floor
,
and
on
a
bench
were
a
dice
-
box
and
shuffle
-
board
,
showing
,
with
the
flasks
and
goblets
on
the
table
,
how
the
occupants
of
the
tower
passed
their
time
.
 
<EOS>
A
steep
ladder
-
like
flight
of
steps
led
to
the
upper
chamber
,
and
down
these
,
at
the
very
moment
of
Mistress
Nutter
's
entrance
,
descended
a
stalwart
personage
,
who
eyed
her
fiercely
as
he
leapt
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
man
's
truculent
physiognomy
,
and
strange
and
oblique
vision
,
that
reminded
her
of
Mother
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Welcome
to
Malkin
Tower
,
madam
,
"
said
the
robber
with
a
grin
,
and
doffing
his
cap
with
affected
courtesy
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
met
before
,
but
it
is
many
years
ago
,
and
I
dare
say
you
have
forgotten
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
guess
who
I
am
when
I
tell
you
my
mother
occupied
this
tower
before
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Finding
Mistress
Nutter
made
no
remark
,
he
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
Christopher
Demdike
,
madam
--
Captain
Demdike
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
The
brave
fellows
who
have
brought
you
hither
are
part
of
my
band
,
and
till
lately
Northumberland
and
the
borders
of
Scotland
used
to
be
our
scene
of
action
;
but
chancing
to
hear
of
my
worthy
old
mother
's
death
<EOS>
,
I
thought
we
could
not
do
better
than
take
possession
of
her
stronghold
,
which
devolved
upon
me
by
right
of
inheritance
.
<EOS>
Since
our
arrival
here
we
have
kept
ourselves
very
quiet
,
and
the
country
folk
,
taking
us
for
spirits
or
demons
,
never
approach
our
hiding
-
place
;
while
,
as
all
our
depredations
are
confined
to
distant
parts
,
our
retreat
has
never
been
suspected
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
concerns
me
little
,
"
observed
Mistress
Nutter
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
madam
<EOS>
,
it
concerns
you
much
,
as
you
will
learn
anon
.
<EOS>
But
be
seated
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
"
he
said
,
with
mock
civility
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
keeping
you
standing
all
this
while
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
as
the
lady
declined
the
attention
,
he
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
fortunate
enough
,
on
first
coming
back
to
this
part
of
the
country
,
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
your
relative
,
Nicholas
Assheton
,
who
invited
me
to
stay
with
him
at
Downham
,
and
was
so
well
pleased
with
my
society
that
he
could
not
endure
to
part
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
<EOS>
are
you
the
person
he
called
Lawrence
Fogg
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
same
,
"
replied
Demdike
;
"
and
no
doubt
you
would
hear
a
good
report
of
me
,
madam
.
<EOS>
Well
,
it
suited
my
purpose
to
stay
;
for
I
was
very
hospitably
entertained
by
the
squire
,
who
,
except
being
rather
too
much
addicted
to
lectures
and
psalm
-
singing
,
is
as
pleasant
a
host
as
one
could
desire
;
besides
which
,
he
was
obliging
enough
to
employ
me
to
borrow
money
for
him
,
and
what
I
got
,
I
kept
,
you
may
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
willingly
be
spared
the
details
of
your
knavery
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
,
somewhat
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
coming
to
an
end
,
"
rejoined
Demdike
,
"
and
then
,
perhaps
,
you
may
wish
I
had
prolonged
them
.
<EOS>
All
the
squire
's
secrets
were
committed
to
me
,
and
I
was
fully
aware
of
your
concealment
in
the
hall
,
but
I
could
never
ascertain
precisely
where
you
were
lodged
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
carry
you
off
,
and
only
awaited
the
opportunity
which
has
presented
itself
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
to
obtain
money
from
me
,
you
will
find
yourself
mistaken
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
parted
with
all
my
possessions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
to
whom
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Demdike
,
with
a
sinister
smile--"to
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
sure
she
is
too
gentle
,
too
tender
-
hearted
,
to
allow
you
to
suffer
when
she
can
relieve
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
get
us
a
good
round
sum
from
her
or
you
will
be
detained
here
long
.
<EOS>
The
dungeons
are
dark
and
unwholesome
,
and
my
band
are
apt
to
be
harsh
in
their
treatment
of
captives
.
<EOS>
They
have
found
in
the
vaults
some
instruments
of
torture
belonging
to
old
Blackburn
,
the
freebooter
,
the
efficacy
of
which
in
an
obstinate
case
I
fear
they
might
be
inclined
to
try
.
<EOS>
You
now
begin
to
see
the
drift
of
my
discourse
,
madam
,
and
understand
the
sort
of
men
you
have
to
deal
with
--
barbarous
fellows
,
madam
--
inhuman
dogs
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
laughed
coarsely
at
his
own
jocularity
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
put
an
end
to
this
discussion
,
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
firmly
,
"
if
I
declare
that
no
torture
shall
induce
me
to
make
any
such
demand
from
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
perhaps
,
I
am
jesting
with
you
,
madam
,
"
rejoined
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
,
I
believe
you
capable
of
any
atrocity
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
,
either
in
feature
or
deeds
,
belie
your
parentage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
say
you
so
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
sharp
tongue
,
I
find
.
<EOS>
Courtesy
is
thrown
away
upon
you
.
<EOS>
What
,
ho
!
<EOS>
lads
--
Kenyon
and
Lowton
,
take
the
lady
down
to
the
vaults
,
and
there
let
her
have
an
hour
for
solitary
reflection
.
<EOS>
She
may
change
her
mind
in
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
not
think
it
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
resolutely
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
continue
obstinate
,
we
will
find
means
to
move
you
,
"
rejoined
Demdike
,
in
a
taunting
tone
.
"
<EOS>
But
what
has
she
got
beneath
her
arm
?
<EOS>
Give
me
the
book
.
<EOS>
What
's
this?--a
Bible
!
<EOS>
A
witch
with
a
Bible
!
<EOS>
It
should
be
a
grimoire
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
it
me
back
,
I
implore
of
you
,
"
shrieked
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
destroyed
,
soul
and
body
,
if
I
have
it
not
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
are
afraid
the
devil
may
carry
you
off
without
it
--
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
that
would
not
suit
my
purpose
at
present
.
<EOS>
Here
,
take
it
--
and
now
off
with
her
,
lads
,
without
more
ado
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
a
trapdoor
was
opened
by
one
of
the
robbers
,
disclosing
a
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
subterranean
chambers
,
down
which
the
miserable
lady
was
dragged
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
the
two
men
re
-
appeared
with
a
grim
smile
on
their
ruffianly
countenances
,
and
,
as
they
closed
the
trapdoor
,
one
of
them
observed
to
the
captain
that
they
had
chained
her
to
a
pillar
,
by
removing
the
band
from
the
great
skeleton
,
and
passing
it
round
her
body
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
well
,
lads
,
"
replied
Demdike
,
approvingly
;
"
and
now
go
all
of
you
and
scour
the
hill
-
top
,
and
return
in
an
hour
,
and
we
will
decide
upon
what
is
to
be
done
with
this
woman
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
two
men
then
joined
the
rest
of
their
comrades
outside
,
and
the
whole
troop
descended
the
steps
,
which
were
afterwards
drawn
up
by
Demdike
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
robber
captain
returned
to
the
circular
chamber
,
and
for
some
time
paced
to
and
fro
,
revolving
his
dark
schemes
.
<EOS>
He
then
paused
,
and
placing
his
ear
near
the
trapdoor
,
listened
,
but
as
no
sound
reached
him
,
he
sat
down
at
the
table
,
and
soon
grew
so
much
absorbed
as
to
be
unconscious
that
a
dark
figure
was
creeping
stealthily
down
the
narrow
staircase
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
get
rid
of
Nicholas
Assheton
,
"
he
exclaimed
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
I
somehow
fancy
we
shall
meet
again
;
and
yet
all
should
be
over
with
him
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Look
round
!
"
thundered
a
voice
behind
him
.
"
<EOS>
Nicholas
Assheton
is
not
to
be
got
rid
of
so
easily
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
unexpected
summons
,
Demdike
started
to
his
feet
,
and
recoiled
aghast
,
as
he
saw
what
he
took
to
be
the
ghost
of
the
murdered
squire
standing
before
him
.
<EOS>
A
second
look
,
however
,
convinced
him
that
it
was
no
phantom
he
beheld
,
but
a
living
man
,
armed
for
vengeance
,
and
determined
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
a
weapon
,
villain
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
in
tones
of
concentrated
fury
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
to
take
unfair
advantage
,
even
of
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
Without
a
word
of
reply
,
Demdike
snatched
a
sword
from
the
wall
,
and
the
next
moment
was
engaged
in
deadly
strife
with
the
squire
.
<EOS>
They
were
well
matched
,
for
both
were
powerful
men
,
both
expert
in
the
use
of
their
weapons
,
and
the
combat
might
have
been
protracted
and
of
doubtful
issue
but
for
the
irresistible
fury
of
Nicholas
,
who
assaulted
his
adversary
with
such
vigour
and
determination
that
he
speedily
drove
him
against
the
wall
,
where
the
latter
made
an
attempt
to
seize
a
petronel
hanging
beside
him
,
but
his
purpose
being
divined
,
he
received
a
thrust
through
the
arm
,
and
,
dropping
his
blade
,
lay
at
the
squire
's
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
shortened
his
sword
,
but
forbore
to
strike
.
<EOS>
Seizing
his
enemy
by
the
throat
,
he
hurled
him
to
the
ground
,
and
,
planting
his
knee
on
his
chest
,
called
out
,
"
What
,
ho
,
Nance
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nance
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
<EOS>
Demdike,--"then
it
was
that
mischievous
jade
who
brought
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
the
squire
,
as
the
young
woman
came
quickly
down
the
steps,--"and
<EOS>
I
refused
her
aid
in
the
conflict
because
I
felt
certain
of
mastering
thee
,
and
because
I
would
not
take
odds
even
against
such
a
treacherous
villain
as
thou
art
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Better
dispatch
him
,
squire
,
"
said
Nance
;
"
he
may
do
yo
a
mischief
yet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
no
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
he
is
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
's
sword
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
have
sworn
to
hang
him
,
and
I
will
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
Go
down
into
the
vaults
and
liberate
Mistress
Nutter
,
while
I
bind
him
,
for
we
must
take
him
with
us
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
he
shall
lie
in
Lancaster
Castle
with
his
kinsfolk
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
muttered
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
on
your
guard
,
squire
,
"
cried
Nance
,
as
she
lifted
a
small
lamp
,
and
raised
the
trapdoor
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
caution
,
she
descended
to
the
vaults
,
while
Nicholas
looked
about
for
a
thong
,
and
perceiving
a
rope
dangling
down
the
wall
near
him
,
he
seized
it
,
drawing
it
with
some
force
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
sudden
sound
reached
his
ears
--
clang
!
<EOS>
clang
!
<EOS>
He
had
rung
the
alarm
-
bell
violently
.
 
<EOS>
Clang
!
<EOS>
clang
!
<EOS>
clang
!
<EOS>
Would
it
never
stop
?
 
<EOS>
Taking
advantage
of
his
surprise
and
consternation
,
Demdike
got
from
under
him
,
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
rushing
to
the
doorway
<EOS>
,
instantly
let
fall
the
steps
,
roaring
out,--
 
"
Treason
!
<EOS>
to
the
rescue
,
my
men
!
<EOS>
to
the
rescue
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
cries
were
immediately
answered
from
without
,
and
it
was
evident
from
the
tumult
that
the
whole
of
the
band
were
hurrying
to
his
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
by
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Plunging
through
the
trapdoor
,
he
closed
it
after
him
,
and
bolted
it
underneath
at
the
very
moment
the
robbers
entered
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
Demdike
's
rage
at
finding
him
gone
was
increased
,
when
all
the
combined
efforts
of
his
men
failed
in
forcing
open
the
trapdoor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
hatchets
and
<EOS>
hew
it
open
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
"
we
must
have
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
there
is
a
secret
outlet
below
,
and
though
I
have
never
been
able
to
discover
it
,
it
may
be
known
to
Nance
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
outside
,
and
watch
.
<EOS>
If
you
hear
me
whistle
,
come
forth
instantly
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
rushing
forth
,
he
was
making
the
circuit
,
of
the
tower
,
and
examining
some
bushes
at
its
base
,
when
his
throat
was
suddenly
seized
by
a
dog
,
and
before
he
could
even
utter
an
exclamation
,
much
less
sound
his
whistle
,
or
use
his
arms
,
he
was
grappled
by
the
old
huntsman
,
and
dragged
off
to
a
considerable
distance
,
the
dog
still
clinging
to
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Nicholas
had
hurried
down
into
the
vaults
,
where
he
found
Nance
sustaining
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
was
half
fainting
,
and
hastily
explaining
what
had
occurred
,
she
consigned
the
lady
to
him
,
and
then
led
the
way
through
the
central
range
of
pillars
,
and
past
the
ebon
image
,
until
she
approached
the
wall
,
when
,
holding
up
the
lamp
,
she
revealed
a
black
marble
slab
between
the
statues
of
Blackburn
and
Isole
.
<EOS>
Pressing
against
it
,
the
slab
moved
on
one
side
,
and
disclosed
a
flight
of
steps
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
up
there
,
"
cried
Nance
to
the
squire
,
"
and
when
ye
get
to
th
'
top
,
yo'n
find
another
stoan
,
wi
'
a
nob
in
it
.
<EOS>
Yo
canna
miss
it
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
!
"
cried
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
come
with
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'n
come
presently
,
"
replied
Nance
,
with
a
strange
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Ey
ha
summat
to
do
first
.
<EOS>
That
cunning
fox
Demdike
has
set
a
trap
fo
'
himsel
an
aw
his
<EOS>
followers,--and
<EOS>
it
's
fo
'
me
to
ketch
'em
.
<EOS>
Wait
fo
'
me
about
a
hundert
yorts
fro
'
th
'
tower
.
<EOS>
Nah
nearer
--
yo
onderstand
?
"
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
did
not
very
clearly
understand
,
but
concluding
Nance
had
some
hidden
meaning
in
what
she
said
,
he
resolved
unhesitatingly
to
obey
her
.
<EOS>
Having
got
clear
of
the
tower
,
as
directed
,
with
Mistress
Nutter
,
he
ran
on
with
her
to
some
distance
,
when
what
was
his
surprise
to
find
Crouch
and
Grip
keeping
watch
over
the
prostrate
robber
chief
.
<EOS>
A
few
words
from
the
huntsman
sufficed
to
explain
how
this
had
come
about
,
but
they
were
scarcely
uttered
when
Nance
rushed
up
in
breathless
haste
,
crying
out--"Off
!
<EOS>
further
off
!
<EOS>
as
yo
value
your
lives
!
"
 
<EOS>
Seeing
from
her
manner
<EOS>
that
delay
would
be
dangerous
,
Nicholas
and
Crouch
laid
hold
of
the
prisoner
and
bore
him
away
between
them
,
while
Nance
assisted
Mistress
Nutter
along
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
not
gone
far
when
a
rumbling
sound
like
that
preceding
an
earthquake
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
All
looked
back
towards
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
The
structure
was
seen
to
rock
--
flames
burst
from
the
earth
--
and
with
a
tremendous
explosion
heard
for
miles
ground
,
and
which
shook
the
ground
even
where
Nicholas
and
the
others
stood
,
the
whole
of
the
unhallowed
fabric
,
from
base
to
summit
,
was
blown
into
the
air
,
some
of
the
stones
being
projected
to
an
extraordinary
distance
.
 
<EOS>
A
mine
charged
with
gunpowder
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
laid
beneath
its
vaults
by
Demdike
,
with
a
view
to
its
destruction
at
some
future
period
,
and
this
circumstance
being
known
to
Nance
<EOS>
,
she
had
fired
the
train
.
 
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
robbers
within
the
tower
escaped
.
<EOS>
The
bodies
of
all
were
found
next
day
,
crushed
,
burned
,
or
frightfully
mutilated
.

TOWER
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
month
after
the
occurrence
last
described
,
and
early
on
a
fine
morning
in
August
,
Nicholas
Assheton
and
Richard
Sherborne
rode
forth
together
from
the
proud
town
of
Preston
.
<EOS>
Both
were
gaily
attired
in
doublets
and
hose
of
yellow
velvet
,
slashed
with
white
silk
,
with
mantles
to
match
,
the
latter
being
somewhat
conspicuously
embroidered
on
the
shoulder
with
a
wild
bull
worked
in
gold
,
and
underneath
it
the
motto
,
"
_
Malgré
le
Tort
_
.
"
<EOS>
Followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
four
mounted
attendants
,
the
two
gentlemen
had
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
Ribble
,
and
were
wending
their
way
along
the
banks
of
a
tributary
stream
,
the
Darwen
,
within
a
short
distance
of
the
charming
village
of
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
,
when
they
perceived
a
horseman
advancing
slowly
towards
them
,
whom
they
instantly
hailed
as
Richard
Assheton
,
and
pushing
forward
,
were
soon
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Both
were
much
shocked
by
the
young
man
's
haggard
looks
,
and
inquired
anxiously
as
to
his
health
,
but
Richard
bade
them
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
,
not
be
uneasy
,
for
all
would
be
well
with
him
erelong
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
will
be
over
with
you
,
lad
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
;
and
that
's
,
perhaps
,
what
you
mean
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
but
as
soon
as
the
royal
festivities
at
Hoghton
are
over
,
I
'll
set
about
your
cure
;
and
,
what
's
more
,
I
'll
accomplish
it
--
for
I
know
where
the
seat
of
the
disease
lies
better
than
Dr.
Morphew
,
your
family
physician
at
Middleton
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
near
the
heart
,
Dick
--
near
the
heart
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
I
see
I
have
touched
you
,
lad
.
<EOS>
But
,
beshrew
me
,
you
are
very
strangely
attired
--
in
a
suit
of
sable
velvet
,
with
a
black
Spanish
hat
and
feather
,
for
a
festival
!
<EOS>
You
look
as
if
going
to
a
funeral
<EOS>
I
am
fearful
his
Majesty
may
take
it
amiss
.
<EOS>
Why
not
wear
the
livery
of
our
house
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
if
it
comes
to
that
,
"
rejoined
Richard
,
"
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
and
Sherborne
wear
it
,
instead
of
flaunting
like
daws
in
borrowed
plumage
?
<EOS>
I
scarce
know
you
in
your
strange
garb
,
and
certainly
should
not
take
you
for
an
Assheton
,
or
aught
pertaining
to
our
family
,
from
your
gaudy
colours
and
the
strange
badge
on
your
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
,
Dick
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
<EOS>
"
I
scarce
know
myself
;
and
though
the
clothes
I
wear
are
well
made
enough
,
they
seem
to
sit
awkwardly
on
me
,
and
trouble
me
as
much
as
the
shirt
of
Nessus
did
Hercules
of
old
.
<EOS>
For
the
nonce
I
am
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
's
retainer
.
<EOS>
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
was
angry
with
myself
when
I
saw
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
with
his
long
train
of
gentlemen
,
all
in
murrey
-
coloured
cloaks
and
doublets
,
at
Myerscough
Lodge
,
while
I
,
his
cousin
,
was
habited
like
one
of
another
house
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
would
have
excused
my
apparent
defection
to
Sir
Ralph
,
he
answered
coldly
,
'
It
was
better
as
it
was
,
for
he
could
scarcely
have
found
room
for
me
among
his
friends
.
'
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
fret
yourself
,
Nicholas
,
"
rejoined
Sherborne
;
"
Sir
Ralph
can
not
reasonably
take
offence
at
a
mere
piece
of
good
-
nature
on
your
part
.
<EOS>
But
this
does
not
explain
why
Richard
affects
a
colour
so
sombre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
retainer
of
one
whose
livery
is
sombre
,
"
replied
the
young
man
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
.
<EOS>
"
But
enough
of
this
,
"
he
added
,
endeavouring
to
assume
a
livelier
air
;
"
I
suppose
you
are
on
the
way
to
Hoghton
Tower
.
<EOS>
I
thought
to
reach
Preston
before
you
were
up
,
but
I
might
have
recollected
you
are
no
lag
-
a
-
bed
,
Nicholas
,
not
even
after
hard
drinking
<EOS>
overnight
,
as
witness
your
feats
at
Whalley
.
<EOS>
To
be
frank
with
you
,
I
feared
being
led
into
like
excesses
,
and
so
preferred
passing
the
night
at
the
quiet
little
inn
at
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
,
to
coming
on
to
you
at
the
Castle
at
Preston
,
which
I
knew
would
be
full
of
noisy
roysterers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Full
it
was
,
even
to
overflowing
,
"
replied
the
squire
;
"
but
you
should
have
come
,
Dick
,
for
,
by
my
troth
!
<EOS>
we
had
a
right
merry
night
of
it
.
<EOS>
Stephen
Hamerton
,
of
Hellyfield
Peel
,
with
his
wife
,
and
her
sister
,
sweet
Mistress
Doll
Lister
,
supped
with
us
;
and
we
had
music
,
dancing
,
and
singing
,
and
abundance
of
good
cheer
.
<EOS>
Nouns
!
<EOS>
Dick
,
Doll
Lister
is
a
delightful
lass
,
and
if
you
can
only
get
Alizon
out
of
your
head
,
would
be
just
the
wife
for
you
.
<EOS>
She
sings
like
an
angel
,
has
the
most
captivating
sigh
-
and
-
die
-
away
manner
,
and
the
prettiest
rounded
figure
ever
bodice
kept
in
.
<EOS>
Were
I
in
your
place
<EOS>
I
should
know
where
to
choose
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
see
her
at
Hoghton
to
-
day
,
for
she
is
to
be
at
the
banquet
and
masque
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
description
does
not
tempt
me
,
"
said
Richard
;
"
I
have
no
taste
for
sigh
-
and
-
die
-
away
damsels
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
Lister
,
however
,
is
accounted
fair
enough
;
but
,
were
she
fascinating
as
Venus
herself
,
in
my
present
mood
I
should
not
regard
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'
faith
,
lad
,
I
pity
you
,
if
such
be
the
case
,
"
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
more
in
contempt
than
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Waste
not
your
sympathy
upon
me
,
"
replied
Richard
;
"
but
,
tell
me
,
how
went
the
show
at
Preston
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Excellently
well
,
and
much
to
his
Majesty
's
satisfaction
,
"
answered
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Proud
Preston
never
was
so
proud
before
,
and
never
with
such
good
reason
;
for
if
the
people
be
poor
,
according
to
the
proverb
,
they
take
good
care
to
hide
their
poverty
.
<EOS>
Bombards
were
fired
from
the
bridge
,
and
the
church
bells
rang
loud
enough
to
crack
the
steeple
,
and
bring
it
down
about
the
ears
of
the
deafened
lieges
.
<EOS>
The
houses
were
hung
with
carpets
and
arras
;
the
streets
strewn
ankle
deep
with
sand
and
sawdust
;
the
cross
in
the
market
-
place
was
bedecked
with
garlands
of
flowers
like
a
May
-
pole
;
and
the
conduit
near
it
ran
wine
.
<EOS>
At
noon
there
was
more
firing
;
and
,
amidst
flourishes
of
trumpets
,
rolling
of
drums
,
squeaking
of
fifes
,
and
prodigious
shouting
,
bonnie
King
Jamie
came
to
the
cross
,
where
a
speech
was
made
him
by
Master
Breares
,
the
Recorder
;
after
which
the
corporation
presented
his
Majesty
with
a
huge
silver
bowl
,
in
token
of
their
love
and
loyalty
.
<EOS>
The
King
seemed
highly
pleased
with
the
gift
,
and
observed
to
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
bystanders
,
who
reported
his
speech
to
me
,
'
God
's
santie
!
<EOS>
it
's
a
braw
bicker
,
Steenie
,
and
might
serve
for
a
christening
-
cup
,
if
we
had
need
of
siccan
a
vessel
,
which
,
Heaven
be
praised
,
we
ha'e
na
!
'
<EOS>
After
this
there
was
a
grand
banquet
in
the
town
-
hall
;
and
when
the
heat
of
the
day
was
over
the
King
left
with
his
train
for
Hoghton
Tower
,
visiting
the
alum
mines
on
the
way
thither
.
<EOS>
We
are
bidden
to
breakfast
by
Sir
Richard
,
so
we
must
push
on
,
Dick
,
for
his
Majesty
<EOS>
is
an
early
riser
,
like
myself
.
<EOS>
We
are
to
have
rare
sport
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Hunting
in
the
morning
,
a
banquet
,
and
,
as
I
have
already
intimated
,
a
masque
at
night
,
in
which
Sir
George
Goring
and
Sir
John
Finett
will
play
,
and
in
which
I
have
been
solicited
to
take
the
drolling
part
of
Jem
Tospot
--
nay
,
laugh
not
,
Dick
,
Sherborne
says
I
shall
play
it
to
the
life
--
as
well
as
to
find
some
mirthful
dame
to
enact
the
companion
part
of
Doll
Wango
.
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
with
two
or
three
on
the
subject
,
and
fancy
one
of
them
will
oblige
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
another
matter
on
which
I
am
engaged
.
<EOS>
I
am
to
present
a
petition
to
his
Majesty
from
a
great
number
of
the
lower
orders
in
this
county
,
praying
they
may
be
allowed
to
take
their
diversions
,
as
of
old
accustomed
,
after
divine
service
on
Sundays
;
and
,
though
I
am
the
last
man
to
desire
any
violation
of
the
Sabbath
,
being
somewhat
puritanically
inclined
as
they
now
phrase
it
,
yet
I
can
not
think
any
harm
can
ensue
from
lawful
recreation
and
honest
exercise
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
would
any
one
were
chosen
to
present
the
petition
rather
than
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
misgivings
on
the
subject
,
"
said
Richard
,
"
but
urge
the
matter
strongly
;
and
if
you
need
support
,
I
will
give
you
all
I
can
,
for
I
feel
we
are
best
observing
the
divine
mandate
by
making
the
Sabbath
a
day
of
rest
,
and
observing
it
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
And
this
,
I
apprehend
,
is
the
substance
of
your
petition
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
whole
sum
and
substance
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
his
Majesty
's
wishes
are
in
accordance
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
known
to
be
so
,
"
said
Sherborne
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
cried
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
God
save
King
James
,
the
friend
of
the
people
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
God
save
King
James
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Nicholas
;
"
and
if
he
<EOS>
I
grant
this
petition
he
will
prove
himself
their
friend
,
for
he
will
I
have
all
the
clergy
against
him
,
and
will
be
preached
against
from
half
the
pulpits
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Little
harm
will
ensue
if
it
should
be
so
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Richard
;
"
for
he
will
be
cheered
and
protected
by
the
prayers
of
a
grateful
and
happy
people
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
then
rode
on
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
,
after
which
;
Richard
inquired--
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
brave
doings
at
Myerscough
Lodge
,
I
suppose
,
Nicholas
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
marry
had
we
,
"
answered
the
squire
,
"
and
the
feasting
must
have
cost
Ned
Tyldesley
a
pretty
penny
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
King
and
his
own
particular
attendants
,
there
were
some
dozen
noblemen
and
their
followers
,
including
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
who
moves
about
like
a
king
himself
,
and
I
know
not
how
many
knights
and
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Sherborne
and
I
rode
over
from
Dunnow
,
and
reached
the
forest
immediately
after
the
King
had
entered
it
in
his
coach
;
so
we
took
a
short
cut
through
the
woods
,
and
came
up
just
in
time
to
join
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
's
train
as
he
was
riding
up
to
his
Majesty
.
<EOS>
Fancy
a
wide
glade
,
down
which
a
great
gilded
coach
is
slowly
moving
,
drawn
by
eight
horses
,
and
followed
by
a
host
of
noblemen
and
gentlemen
in
splendid
apparel
,
their
esquires
and
pages
equally
richly
arrayed
,
and
equally
well
mounted
;
and
,
after
these
,
numerous
falconers
,
huntsmen
,
prickers
,
foresters
,
and
yeomen
,
with
staghounds
in
leash
,
and
hawk
on
fist
,
all
ready
for
the
sport
.
<EOS>
Fancy
all
this
if
you
can
,
Dick
,
and
then
conceive
what
a
brave
sight
it
must
have
been
.
<EOS>
Well
,
as
I
said
,
we
came
up
in
the
very
nick
of
time
,
for
presently
the
royal
coach
stopped
,
and
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
calling
all
his
gentlemen
around
him
,
and
bidding
us
dismount
,
and
we
followed
him
,
and
drew
up
,
bareheaded
,
before
the
King
,
while
Sir
Richard
pointed
out
to
his
Majesty
the
boundaries
of
the
royal
forest
,
and
told
him
he
would
find
it
as
well
stocked
with
deer
as
any
in
his
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Before
putting
an
end
to
the
conference
,
the
King
complimented
the
worthy
Knight
on
the
gallant
appearance
of
his
train
,
and
on
learning
we
were
all
gentlemen
,
graciously
signified
his
pleasure
that
some
of
us
should
be
presented
to
him
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
I
was
brought
forward
by
Sir
Richard
,
and
liking
my
looks
,
I
suppose
,
the
King
was
condescending
enough
to
enter
into
conversation
with
me
;
and
as
his
discourse
chiefly
turned
on
sporting
matters
,
I
was
at
home
with
him
at
once
,
and
he
presently
grew
so
familiar
with
me
,
that
I
almost
forgot
the
presence
in
which
I
stood
.
<EOS>
However
,
his
Majesty
seemed
in
no
way
offended
by
my
freedom
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
,
'
Maister
Assheton
,
for
a
country
gentleman
,
you
're
weel
-
mannered
and
weel
-
informed
,
and
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
more
of
you
while
I
stay
in
these
parts
.
'
<EOS>
After
this
,
the
good
-
natured
monarch
mounted
his
horse
,
and
the
hunting
began
,
and
a
famous
day
's
work
we
made
of
it
,
his
Majesty
killing
no
fewer
than
five
fine
bucks
with
his
own
hand
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
clearly
on
the
road
to
preferment
,
Nicholas
,
"
observed
Richard
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
outstrip
Buckingham
himself
,
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
tell
him
,
"
observed
Sherborne
,
laughing
;
"
and
,
by
my
faith
!
<EOS>
young
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
who
,
owing
to
his
connexion
by
marriage
with
Buckingham
,
is
a
greater
man
than
his
father
,
Sir
Richard
,
looked
quite
jealous
;
for
the
King
more
than
once
called
out
to
Nicholas
in
the
chase
,
and
took
the
wood
-
knife
from
him
when
he
broke
up
the
last
deer
,
which
is
accounted
a
mark
of
especial
favour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
squire
,
"
I
shall
not
stand
in
my
own
light
,
depend
upon
it
;
and
,
if
I
should
bask
in
court
-
sunshine
,
you
shall
partake
of
the
rays
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
become
master
of
the
household
,
in
lieu
of
the
Duke
of
Richmond
,
or
master
of
the
horse
and
cupbearer
to
his
Majesty
,
in
place
of
his
Grace
of
Buckingham
,
I
will
not
forget
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
greatly
indebted
to
you
,
my
Lord
Marquess
of
Downham
and
Duke
of
Pendle
Hill
,
that
is
to
be
,
"
rejoined
Sherborne
,
taking
off
his
cap
with
mock
reverence
;
"
and
perhaps
,
for
the
sake
of
your
sweet
sister
and
my
spouse
,
Dorothy
,
you
will
make
interest
to
have
me
appointed
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Doubt
it
not
--
doubt
it
not
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
in
a
patronising
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
ambition
soars
higher
than
yours
,
Sherborne
,
"
said
Richard
;
"
I
must
be
lord
-
keeper
of
the
privy
seal
,
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
you
will
,
gentlemen
,
what
you
will
!
"
cried
Nicholas
;
"
you
can
ask
me
nothing
I
will
not
grant
--
always
provided
I
have
the
means
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
turn
in
the
road
now
showed
them
Hoghton
Tower
,
crowning
the
summit
of
an
isolated
and
conical
hill
,
about
two
miles
off
.
<EOS>
Rising
proudly
in
the
midst
of
a
fair
and
fertile
plain
,
watered
by
the
Ribble
and
the
Darwen
,
the
stately
edifice
seemed
to
command
the
whole
country
.
<EOS>
And
so
King
James
thought
,
as
,
from
the
window
of
his
chamber
,
he
looked
down
upon
the
magnificent
prospect
around
him
,
comprehending
on
the
one
hand
the
vast
forests
of
Myerscough
and
Bowland
,
stretching
as
far
as
the
fells
near
Lancaster
;
and
,
on
the
other
,
an
open
but
still
undulating
country
,
beautifully
diversified
with
wood
and
water
,
well
-
peopled
and
well
-
cultivated
,
green
with
luxuriant
pastures
,
yellow
with
golden
grain
,
or
embowered
with
orchards
,
boasting
many
villages
and
small
towns
,
as
well
as
two
lovely
rivers
,
which
,
combining
their
currents
at
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
,
gradually
expanded
till
they
neared
the
sea
,
which
could
be
seen
gleaming
through
openings
in
the
distant
hills
.
<EOS>
As
the
King
surveyed
this
fair
scene
,
and
thought
how
strong
was
the
position
of
the
mansion
,
situated
as
it
was
upon
high
cliffs
springing
abruptly
from
the
Darwen
,
and
how
favourably
circumstanced
,
with
its
forests
and
park
,
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
chase
,
of
which
he
was
passionately
fond
,
how
capable
of
defence
,
and
how
well
adapted
for
a
hunting
-
seat
,
he
sighed
to
think
it
did
not
belong
to
the
crown
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
its
strength
,
for
in
after
years
,
during
the
civil
wars
,
it
held
out
stoutly
against
the
parliamentary
forces
,
and
was
only
reduced
at
last
by
treachery
,
when
part
of
its
gate
-
tower
was
blown
up
,
destroying
an
officer
and
two
hundred
men
,
"
in
that
blast
most
wofully
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Though
the
hour
was
so
early
,
the
road
was
already
thronged
,
not
only
with
horsemen
and
pedestrians
of
every
degree
from
Preston
,
but
with
rude
lumbering
vehicles
from
the
neighbouring
villages
of
Plessington
,
Brockholes
and
Cuerden
,
driven
by
farmers
,
who
,
with
their
buxom
dames
and
cherry
-
cheeked
daughters
,
decked
out
in
holiday
finery
,
hoped
to
gain
admittance
to
Hoghton
Tower
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
obtain
a
peep
of
the
King
as
he
rode
out
to
hunt
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
were
saluted
by
Nicholas
,
who
scrupled
not
to
promise
them
admission
to
the
outer
court
of
the
Tower
,
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
offer
some
of
the
comelier
damsels
a
presentation
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
the
road
was
enlivened
by
strains
of
music
from
a
band
of
minstrels
,
by
a
song
or
a
chorus
from
others
,
or
by
the
gamesome
tricks
of
a
party
of
mummers
.
<EOS>
At
one
place
,
a
couple
of
tumblers
and
a
clown
were
performing
their
feats
on
a
cloth
stretched
on
the
grass
beneath
a
tree
.
<EOS>
Here
the
crowd
collected
for
a
few
minutes
,
but
presently
gave
way
to
loud
shouts
,
attended
by
the
cracking
of
whips
,
proceeding
from
two
grooms
in
the
yellow
and
white
livery
of
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
who
headed
some
half
-
dozen
carts
filled
with
provisions
,
carcases
of
sheep
and
oxen
,
turkeys
and
geese
,
pullets
and
capons
,
fish
,
bread
,
and
vegetables
,
all
bent
for
Hoghton
Tower
;
for
though
Sir
Richard
had
made
vast
preparations
for
his
guests
,
he
found
his
supplies
,
great
as
they
were
,
wholly
inadequate
to
their
wants
.
<EOS>
Cracking
their
whips
in
answer
to
the
shouts
with
which
they
were
greeted
,
the
purveyors
galloped
on
,
many
a
hungry
wight
looking
wistfully
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
and
his
companions
were
now
at
the
entrance
to
Hoghton
Park
,
through
which
the
Darwen
coursed
,
after
washing
the
base
of
the
rocky
heights
on
which
the
mansion
was
situated
.
<EOS>
Here
four
yeomen
of
the
guard
,
armed
with
halberts
,
and
an
officer
,
were
stationed
,
and
no
one
was
admitted
without
an
order
from
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
.
<EOS>
Possessing
a
pass
,
the
squire
and
his
companions
with
their
attendants
were
,
of
course
,
allowed
to
enter
;
but
the
throng
accompanying
them
were
sent
over
the
bridge
,
and
along
a
devious
road
skirting
the
park
,
which
,
though
it
went
more
than
a
mile
round
,
eventually
brought
them
to
their
destination
.
 
<EOS>
Hoghton
Park
,
though
not
very
extensive
,
boasted
a
great
deal
of
magnificent
timber
,
and
in
some
places
was
so
thickly
wooded
,
that
,
according
to
Dr.
Kuerden
,
"
a
man
passing
through
it
could
scarcely
have
seen
the
sun
shine
at
middle
of
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Into
one
of
these
tenebrous
groves
the
horsemen
now
plunged
,
and
for
some
moments
were
buried
in
the
gloom
produced
by
matted
and
overhanging
boughs
.
<EOS>
Issuing
once
more
into
the
warm
sunshine
,
they
traversed
a
long
and
beautiful
silvan
glade
,
skirted
by
ancient
oaks
,
with
mighty
arms
and
gnarled
limbs
--
the
patriarchs
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
In
the
open
ground
on
the
left
were
scattered
a
few
ash
-
trees
,
and
beneath
them
browsed
a
herd
of
fallow
deer
;
while
crossing
the
lower
end
of
the
glade
was
a
large
herd
of
red
deer
,
for
which
the
park
was
famous
,
the
hinds
tripping
nimbly
and
timidly
away
,
but
the
lordly
stags
,
with
their
branching
antlers
,
standing
for
a
moment
at
gaze
,
and
disdainfully
regarding
the
intruders
on
their
domain
.
<EOS>
Little
did
they
think
how
soon
and
severely
their
courage
would
be
tried
,
or
how
soon
the
_
mort
<EOS>
_
would
be
sounded
for
their
_
pryse
_
by
the
huntsman
.
<EOS>
But
if
,
happily
for
themselves
,
the
poor
leathern
-
coated
fools
could
not
foresee
their
doom
,
it
was
not
equally
hidden
from
Nicholas
,
who
predicted
what
would
ensue
,
and
pointed
out
one
noble
hart
which
he
thought
worthy
to
die
by
the
King
's
own
hand
.
<EOS>
As
if
he
understood
him
,
the
stately
beast
tossed
his
antlered
head
aloft
,
and
plunged
into
the
adjoining
thicket
;
but
the
squire
noted
the
spot
where
he
had
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
glade
led
them
into
the
chase
,
a
glorious
hunting
-
ground
of
about
two
miles
in
circumference
,
surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
wood
,
and
studded
by
noble
forest
trees
.
<EOS>
Variety
and
beauty
were
lent
to
it
by
an
occasional
knoll
crowned
with
timber
,
or
by
numerous
ferny
dells
and
dingles
.
<EOS>
As
the
horsemen
entered
upon
the
chase
,
they
observed
at
a
short
distance
from
them
a
herd
of
the
beautiful
,
but
fierce
wild
cattle
,
originally
from
Bowland
Forest
,
and
still
preserved
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
White
and
spangled
in
colour
,
with
short
sharp
horns
,
fine
eyes
,
and
small
shapely
limbs
,
these
animals
were
of
untameable
fierceness
,
possessed
of
great
cunning
,
and
ever
ready
to
assault
any
one
who
approached
them
.
<EOS>
They
would
often
attack
a
solitary
individual
,
gore
him
,
and
trample
him
to
death
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
they
were
far
more
dreaded
than
the
wild
-
boars
,
with
which
,
as
with
every
other
sort
of
game
,
the
neighbouring
woods
were
plentifully
stocked
.
<EOS>
Well
aware
of
the
danger
they
ran
,
the
party
watched
the
herd
narrowly
and
distrustfully
,
and
would
have
galloped
on
;
but
this
would
only
have
provoked
pursuit
,
and
the
wild
cattle
were
swifter
than
any
horses
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
a
milkwhite
bull
trotted
out
from
the
rest
of
the
herd
,
bellowing
fiercely
,
lashing
his
sides
with
his
tail
,
and
lowering
his
head
to
the
ground
,
as
if
meditating
an
attack
.
<EOS>
His
example
was
speedily
followed
by
the
others
,
and
the
whole
herd
began
to
beat
ground
and
roar
loudly
.
<EOS>
Much
alarmed
by
these
hostile
manifestations
,
the
party
were
debating
whether
to
stand
the
onset
,
or
trust
to
the
fleetness
of
their
steeds
for
safety
;
when
just
as
the
whole
herd
,
with
tails
erect
and
dilated
nostrils
,
were
galloping
towards
them
,
assistance
appeared
in
the
persons
of
some
ten
or
a
dozen
mounted
prickers
,
who
,
armed
with
long
poles
pointed
with
iron
,
issued
with
loud
shouts
from
an
avenue
opening
upon
the
chase
.
<EOS>
At
sight
of
them
,
the
whole
herd
wheeled
round
and
fled
,
but
were
pursued
by
the
prickers
till
they
were
driven
into
the
depths
of
the
furthest
thicket
.
<EOS>
Six
of
the
prickers
remained
watching
over
them
during
the
day
,
in
order
that
the
royal
hunting
-
party
might
not
be
disturbed
,
and
the
woods
echoed
with
the
bellowing
of
the
angry
brutes
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
forward
,
the
squire
and
his
companions
,
congratulating
themselves
on
their
narrow
escape
,
galloped
off
,
and
entered
the
long
avenue
of
sycamores
,
from
which
the
prickers
had
emerged
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
a
steep
ascent
,
partly
hewn
out
of
the
rock
,
and
partly
skirted
by
venerable
and
majestic
trees
,
forming
a
continuation
of
the
avenue
,
rose
the
embattled
gate
-
tower
of
the
proud
edifice
they
were
approaching
,
and
which
now
held
the
monarch
of
the
land
,
and
the
highest
and
noblest
of
his
court
as
guests
within
its
halls
.
<EOS>
From
the
top
of
the
central
tower
of
the
gateway
floated
the
royal
banner
,
while
at
the
very
moment
the
party
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
they
were
saluted
by
a
loud
peal
of
ordnance
discharged
from
the
side
-
towers
,
proclaiming
that
the
King
had
arisen
;
and
,
as
the
smoke
from
the
culverins
wreathed
round
the
standard
,
a
flourish
of
trumpets
was
blown
from
the
walls
,
and
martial
music
resounded
from
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
Roused
by
these
stirring
sounds
,
Nicholas
spurred
his
horse
up
the
rocky
ascent
;
and
followed
closely
by
his
companions
,
who
were
both
nearly
as
much
excited
as
himself
,
speedily
gained
the
great
gateway
--
a
massive
and
majestic
structure
,
occupying
the
centre
of
the
western
front
of
the
mansion
,
and
consisting
of
three
towers
of
great
strength
and
beauty
,
the
mid
-
tower
far
overtopping
the
other
two
,
as
in
the
arms
of
Old
Castile
,
and
sustaining
,
as
was
its
right
,
the
royal
standard
.
<EOS>
On
the
platform
stood
the
trumpeters
with
their
silk
-
fringed
clarions
,
and
the
iron
mouths
of
the
culverins
,
which
had
been
recently
discharged
,
protruded
through
the
battlements
.
<EOS>
The
arms
and
motto
of
the
Hoghtons
,
carved
in
stone
,
were
placed
upon
the
gateway
,
with
the
letters
T.H.
,
the
initials
of
the
founder
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Immediately
above
the
arched
entrance
was
the
sculptured
figure
of
a
knight
slaying
a
dragon
.
 
<EOS>
In
front
of
the
gateway
a
large
crowd
of
persons
were
assembled
,
consisting
of
the
inferior
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
,
with
their
wives
,
daughters
,
and
servants
,
clergymen
,
attorneys
,
chirurgeons
,
farmers
,
and
tradesmen
of
all
kind
from
the
adjoining
towns
of
Blackburn
,
Preston
,
Chorley
,
Haslingden
,
Garstang
,
and
even
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Representatives
in
some
sort
or
other
of
almost
every
town
and
village
in
the
county
might
be
found
amongst
the
motley
assemblage
,
which
,
early
as
it
was
,
numbered
several
hundreds
,
many
of
those
from
the
more
distant
places
having
quitted
their
homes
soon
after
midnight
.
<EOS>
Admittance
was
naturally
sought
by
all
;
but
here
the
same
rule
was
observed
as
at
the
park
gate
,
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
enter
,
even
the
base
court
,
without
authority
from
the
lord
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
The
great
gates
were
closed
,
and
two
files
of
halberdiers
were
drawn
up
under
the
deep
archway
,
to
keep
the
passage
clear
,
and
quell
disturbance
in
case
any
should
occur
;
while
a
gigantic
porter
,
stationed
in
front
of
the
wicket
,
rigorously
scrutinised
the
passes
.
<EOS>
These
precautions
naturally
produced
delay
;
and
,
though
many
of
the
better
part
of
the
crowd
were
entitled
to
admission
,
it
was
not
without
much
pushing
and
squeezing
,
and
considerable
detriment
to
their
gay
apparel
,
that
they
were
enabled
to
effect
their
object
.
 
<EOS>
The
comfort
of
those
outside
the
walls
had
not
,
however
,
been
altogether
neglected
by
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
for
sheds
were
reared
under
the
trees
,
where
stout
March
beer
,
together
with
cheese
and
bread
,
or
oaten
cakes
and
butter
,
were
freely
distributed
to
all
applicants
;
so
that
,
if
some
were
disappointed
,
few
were
discontented
,
especially
when
told
that
the
gates
would
be
thrown
open
at
noon
,
when
,
during
the
time
the
King
and
the
nobles
feasted
in
the
great
banquet
-
hall
,
they
might
partake
of
a
wild
bull
from
the
park
,
slaughtered
expressly
for
the
occasion
,
which
was
now
being
roasted
whole
within
the
base
court
.
<EOS>
That
the
latter
was
no
idle
promise
they
had
the
assurance
of
thick
smoke
rising
above
the
walls
,
laden
with
the
scent
of
roast
meat
,
and
,
moreover
,
they
could
see
through
the
wicket
a
great
fire
blazing
and
crackling
on
the
green
,
with
a
huge
carcass
on
an
immense
spit
before
it
,
and
a
couple
of
turn
-
broaches
basting
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
Nicholas
and
his
companions
forced
their
way
through
this
crowd
,
which
was
momently
receiving
additions
as
fresh
arrivals
took
place
,
the
squire
recognised
many
old
acquaintances
,
and
was
nodding
familiarly
right
and
left
,
when
he
encountered
a
woman
's
eye
fixed
keenly
upon
him
,
and
to
his
surprise
beheld
Nance
Redferne
.
<EOS>
Nance
,
who
had
lost
none
of
her
good
looks
,
was
very
gaily
attired
,
with
her
fine
chestnut
hair
knotted
with
ribbons
,
her
stomacher
similarly
adorned
,
and
her
red
petticoat
looped
up
,
so
as
to
display
an
exceedingly
trim
ankle
and
small
foot
;
and
,
under
other
circumstances
,
Nicholas
might
not
have
minded
staying
to
chat
with
her
,
but
just
now
it
was
out
of
the
question
,
and
he
hastily
turned
his
head
another
way
.
<EOS>
As
ill
luck
,
however
,
would
have
it
,
a
stoppage
occurred
at
the
moment
,
during
which
Nance
forced
her
way
up
to
him
,
and
,
taking
hold
of
his
arm
,
said
in
a
low
tone--
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
mun
tae
me
in
wi
'
ye
,
squoire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
you
in
with
me
--
impossible
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nah
!
<EOS>
it
's
neaw
impossible
,
"
rejoined
Nance
,
pertinaciously
;
"
yo
con
do
it
,
an
yo
shan
.
<EOS>
Yo
owe
me
a
good
turn
,
and
mun
repay
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
the
devil
do
you
want
to
go
in
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
King
is
the
sworn
enemy
of
all
witches
,
and
,
amongst
this
concourse
,
some
one
is
sure
to
recognise
you
and
betray
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
answer
for
your
safety
if
I
do
take
you
in
.
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
,
you
were
extremely
unwise
to
venture
here
at
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ne'er
heed
my
wisdom
or
my
folly
,
boh
do
as
ey
bid
yo
,
or
yo'n
repent
it
,
"
said
Nance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
can
get
in
without
my
aid
,
"
observed
the
squire
,
trying
to
laugh
it
off
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
easily
fly
over
the
walls
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
ha
'
left
my
broomstick
a
-
whoam
,
"
replied
Nance--"boh
no
more
jesting
.
<EOS>
Win
yo
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
suppose
I
must
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
but
I
wash
my
hands
of
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
If
ill
comes
of
it
,
I
am
not
to
blame
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
in
as
Doll
Wango
--
<EOS>
that
is
,
as
a
character
in
the
masque
to
be
enacted
to
-
night
--
d'ye
mark
?
"
 
<EOS>
Nance
signified
that
she
perfectly
understood
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
of
this
hurried
discourse
,
conducted
in
an
under
-
tone
,
passed
unheard
and
unnoticed
by
the
bystanders
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
an
opening
took
place
amid
the
crowd
,
and
the
squire
pushed
through
it
,
hoping
to
get
rid
of
his
companion
,
but
he
hoped
in
vain
,
for
,
clinging
to
his
saddle
<EOS>
,
she
went
on
along
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
soon
under
the
deep
groined
and
ribbed
arch
of
the
gate
,
and
Nance
would
have
been
here
turned
back
by
the
foremost
halberdier
,
if
Nicholas
had
not
signified
somewhat
hastily
that
she
belonged
to
his
party
.
<EOS>
The
man
smiled
,
and
offered
no
further
opposition
;
and
the
gigantic
porter
next
advancing
,
Nicholas
exhibited
his
pass
to
him
,
which
appearing
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
procure
admission
for
Richard
and
Sherborne
,
they
instantly
availed
themselves
of
the
licence
,
while
the
squire
fumbled
in
his
doublet
for
a
further
order
for
Nance
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
produced
it
,
and
after
reading
it
,
the
gigantic
warder
exclaimed
,
with
a
smile
illumining
his
broad
features--
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see;--this
is
an
order
from
his
worship
,
Sir
Richard
,
to
admit
a
certain
woman
,
who
is
to
enact
Doll
Wango
in
the
masque
.
<EOS>
This
is
she
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
looking
at
Nance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
"
replied
the
squire
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
comely
wench
,
by
the
mass
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
porter
.
"
<EOS>
Open
the
gate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
not
yet
--
not
yet
,
good
porter
,
till
my
claim
be
adjusted
,
"
cried
another
woman
,
pushing
forward
,
quite
as
young
and
comely
as
Nance
,
and
equally
gaily
dressed
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
real
Doll
Wango
,
though
I
be
generally
known
as
Dame
Tetlow
.
<EOS>
The
squire
engaged
me
to
play
the
part
before
the
King
,
and
now
this
saucy
hussy
has
taken
my
place
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
have
my
rights
,
that
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Odd
's
heart
!
<EOS>
two
Doll
Wangos
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
porter
,
opening
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two!--Nay
,
beleedy
!
<EOS>
boh
there
be
three
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
an
immensely
tall
,
stoutly
proportioned
woman
,
stepping
up
,
to
the
increased
confusion
of
the
squire
,
and
the
infinite
merriment
of
the
bystanders
,
whose
laughter
had
been
already
excited
by
the
previous
part
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
"
Didna
yo
tell
me
at
Myerscough
to
come
here
,
squire
,
an
ey
,
Bess
Baldwyn
,
should
play
Doll
Wango
to
your
Jem
Tospot
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Play
the
devil
!
<EOS>
for
that
's
what
you
all
seem
bent
upon
doing
,
"
exclaimed
the
squire
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Away
with
you
!
<EOS>
I
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
gave
me
the
same
promise
at
the
Castle
at
Preston
last
night
,
"
said
Dame
Tetlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
been
drinking
,
and
knew
not
what
I
said
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Boh
yo
promised
me
a
few
minutes
ago
,
an
yo're
sober
enough
now
,
"
cried
Nance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
dunna
knoa
<EOS>
that
,
"
rejoined
Dame
Baldwyn
,
looking
reproachfully
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Boh
what
ey
<EOS>
dun
knoa
is
,
that
nother
o
'
these
squemous
queans
shan
ge
in
efore
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
looked
menacingly
at
them
,
as
if
determined
to
oppose
their
ingress
,
much
to
the
alarm
of
the
timorous
Dame
Tetlow
,
though
Nance
returned
her
angry
glances
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
my
good
fellow
,
let
them
all
three
in
!
"
<EOS>
said
Nicholas
,
in
a
low
tone
to
the
porter
,
at
the
same
time
slipping
a
gold
piece
into
his
hand
,
"
or
<EOS>
there
's
no
saying
what
may
be
the
consequence
,
for
they
're
three
infernal
viragos
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
the
responsibility
of
their
admittance
upon
myself
with
Sir
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
as
your
worship
says
,
I
do
n't
like
to
see
quarrelling
amongst
women
,
"
returned
the
porter
,
in
a
bland
tone
,
"
<EOS>
so
all
three
shall
go
in
;
and
as
to
who
is
to
play
Doll
Wango
,
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
will
settle
that
,
so
you
need
give
yourself
no
more
concern
about
it
;
but
if
I
were
called
on
to
decide
,
"
he
added
,
with
an
amorous
leer
at
Dame
Baldwyn
,
whose
proportions
so
well
matched
his
own
,
"
I
know
where
my
choice
would
light
.
<EOS>
There
,
now
!
<EOS>
"
he
shouted
,
"
Open
wide
the
gate
for
Squire
Nicholas
Assheton
of
Downham
,
and
the
three
Doll
Wangos
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
all
obstacles
being
thus
removed
,
Nicholas
passed
on
with
the
three
females
amidst
the
renewed
laughter
of
the
bystanders
.
<EOS>
But
he
got
rid
of
his
plagues
as
soon
as
he
could
;
for
,
dismounting
and
throwing
his
bridle
to
an
attendant
,
he
vouchsafed
not
a
word
to
any
of
them
,
but
stepped
quickly
after
Richard
and
Sherborne
,
who
had
already
reached
the
great
fire
with
the
bull
roasting
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
Appropriated
chiefly
to
stables
and
other
offices
,
the
base
court
of
Hoghton
Tower
consisted
of
buildings
of
various
dates
,
the
greater
part
belonging
to
Elizabeth
's
time
,
though
some
might
be
assigned
to
an
earlier
period
,
while
many
alterations
and
additions
had
been
recently
made
,
in
anticipation
of
the
king
's
visit
.
<EOS>
Dating
back
as
far
as
Henry
II
.
<EOS>
,
the
family
had
originally
fixed
their
residence
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
on
the
banks
of
the
Darwen
;
but
in
process
of
time
,
swayed
by
prouder
notions
,
they
mounted
the
craggy
heights
above
,
and
built
a
tower
upon
their
crest
.
<EOS>
It
is
melancholy
to
think
that
so
glorious
a
pile
,
teeming
with
so
many
historical
recollections
,
and
so
magnificently
situated
,
should
be
abandoned
,
and
suffered
to
go
to
decay;--the
<EOS>
family
having
,
many
years
ago
,
quitted
it
for
Walton
Hall
,
near
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
,
and
consigned
it
to
the
occupation
of
a
few
gamekeepers
.
<EOS>
Bereft
of
its
venerable
timber
,
its
courts
grass
-
grown
,
its
fine
oak
staircase
rotting
and
dilapidated
,
its
domestic
chapel
neglected
,
its
marble
chamber
broken
and
ruinous
,
its
wainscotings
and
ceilings
cracked
and
mouldering
,
<EOS>
its
paintings
mildewed
and
half
effaced
,
Hoghton
Tower
presents
only
the
wreck
of
its
former
grandeur
.
<EOS>
Desolate
indeed
are
its
halls
,
and
their
glory
for
ever
departed
!
<EOS>
However
,
this
history
has
to
do
with
it
in
the
season
of
its
greatest
splendour
;
when
it
glistened
with
silks
and
velvets
,
and
resounded
with
loud
laughter
and
blithe
music
;
when
stately
nobles
and
lovely
dames
were
seen
in
the
gallery
,
and
a
royal
banquet
was
served
in
the
great
hall
;
when
its
countless
chambers
were
filled
to
overflowing
,
and
its
passages
echoed
with
hasty
feet
;
when
the
base
court
was
full
of
huntsmen
and
falconers
,
and
enlivened
by
the
neighing
of
steeds
and
the
baying
of
hounds
;
when
there
was
daily
hunting
in
the
park
,
and
nightly
dancing
and
diversion
in
the
hall,--it
is
with
Hoghton
Tower
at
this
season
that
the
present
tale
has
to
do
,
and
not
with
it
as
it
is
now
--
silent
,
solitary
,
squalid
,
saddening
,
but
still
whispering
of
the
glories
of
the
past
,
still
telling
of
the
kingly
pageant
that
once
graced
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
base
court
was
divided
from
the
court
of
lodging
by
the
great
hall
and
domestic
chapel
.
<EOS>
A
narrow
vaulted
passage
on
either
side
led
to
the
upper
quadrangle
,
the
facade
of
which
was
magnificent
,
and
far
superior
in
uniformity
of
design
and
style
to
the
rest
of
the
structure
,
the
irregularity
of
which
,
however
,
was
not
unpleasing
.
<EOS>
The
whole
frontage
of
the
upper
court
was
richly
moulded
and
filleted
,
with
ranges
of
mullion
and
transom
windows
,
capitals
,
and
carved
parapets
crowned
with
stone
balls
.
<EOS>
Marble
pillars
,
in
the
Italian
style
,
had
been
recently
placed
near
the
porch
,
with
two
rows
of
pilasters
above
them
,
supporting
a
heavy
marble
cornice
,
on
which
rested
the
carved
escutcheon
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
A
flight
of
stone
steps
led
up
to
the
porch
,
and
within
was
a
wide
oak
staircase
,
so
gentle
of
ascent
that
a
man
on
horseback
could
easily
mount
it
--
a
feat
often
practised
in
later
days
by
one
of
the
descendants
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
In
this
part
of
the
mansion
all
the
principal
apartments
were
situated
,
and
here
James
was
lodged
.
<EOS>
Here
also
was
the
green
room
,
so
called
from
its
hangings
,
which
he
used
for
private
conferences
,
and
which
was
hung
round
with
portraits
of
his
unfortunate
mother
,
Mary
,
Queen
of
Scots
;
of
her
implacable
enemy
,
Queen
Elizabeth
;
of
his
consort
,
Anne
of
Bohemia
:
and
of
Sir
Thomas
Hoghton
,
the
founder
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Adjoining
it
was
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
occupied
by
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
with
its
napkin
panelling
,
and
ceiling
"
fretted
with
golden
fires
;
"
and
in
the
same
angle
were
rooms
occupied
by
the
Duke
of
Richmond
,
the
Earls
of
Pembroke
and
Nottingham
,
and
Lord
Howard
of
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Below
was
the
library
,
whither
Doctor
Thomas
Moreton
,
Bishop
of
Chester
,
and
his
Majesty
's
chaplain
,
with
the
three
puisné
judges
of
the
King
's
Bench
,
Sir
John
Doddridge
,
Sir
John
Crooke
,
and
Sir
Robert
Hoghton
,
all
of
whom
were
guests
of
Sir
Richard
,
resorted
;
and
in
the
adjoining
wing
was
the
great
gallery
,
where
the
whole
of
the
nobles
and
courtiers
passed
such
of
their
time
--
and
that
was
not
much
--
as
was
not
occupied
in
feasting
or
out
-
of
-
doors
'
amusements
.
 
<EOS>
Long
corridors
ran
round
the
upper
stories
in
this
part
of
the
mansion
,
and
communicated
with
an
endless
series
of
rooms
,
which
,
numerous
as
they
were
,
were
all
occupied
,
and
,
accommodation
being
found
impossible
for
the
whole
of
the
guests
,
many
were
sent
to
the
new
erections
in
the
base
court
,
which
had
been
planned
to
meet
the
emergency
by
the
magnificent
and
provident
host
.
<EOS>
The
nobles
and
gentlemen
were
,
however
,
far
outnumbered
by
their
servants
,
and
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
running
to
and
fro
of
the
various
grooms
of
the
chambers
,
was
indescribable
.
<EOS>
Doublets
had
to
be
brushed
,
ruffs
plaited
,
hair
curled
,
beards
trimmed
,
and
all
with
the
greatest
possible
expedition
;
so
that
,
as
soon
as
day
dawned
upon
Hoghton
Tower
,
there
was
a
prodigious
racket
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Many
favoured
servants
slept
in
truckle
-
beds
in
their
masters
'
rooms
;
but
others
,
not
so
fortunate
,
and
unable
to
find
accommodation
even
in
the
garrets
--
for
the
smallest
rooms
,
and
those
nearest
the
roof
,
were
put
in
requisition
--
slept
upon
the
benches
in
the
hall
,
while
several
sat
up
all
night
carousing
in
the
great
kitchen
,
keeping
company
with
the
cooks
and
their
assistants
,
who
were
busied
all
the
time
in
preparations
for
the
feasting
of
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
state
of
things
inside
Hoghton
Tower
early
on
the
eventful
morning
in
question
,
and
out
of
doors
,
especially
in
the
base
court
which
Nicholas
was
traversing
,
the
noise
,
bustle
,
and
confusion
were
equally
great
.
<EOS>
Wide
as
was
the
area
,
it
was
filled
with
various
personages
,
some
newly
arrived
,
and
seeking
information
as
to
their
quarters
--
not
very
easily
obtained
,
<EOS>
for
it
seemed
every
body
's
business
to
ask
questions
,
and
no
one
's
to
answer
them
--
<EOS>
some
gathered
in
groups
round
the
falconers
and
huntsmen
,
who
had
suddenly
risen
into
great
importance
;
others
,
and
these
were
for
the
most
part
smart
young
pages
,
in
brilliant
liveries
,
chattering
,
and
making
love
to
every
pretty
damsel
they
encountered
,
putting
them
out
of
countenance
by
their
licence
and
strange
oaths
,
and
rousing
the
anger
of
their
parents
,
and
the
jealousy
of
their
rustic
admirers
;
others
,
of
a
graver
sort
,
with
dress
of
formal
cut
,
and
puritanical
expression
of
countenance
,
shrugging
their
shoulders
,
and
looking
sourly
on
the
whole
proceedings
--
luckily
they
were
in
the
minority
,
for
the
generality
of
the
groups
were
composed
of
lively
and
light
-
hearted
people
,
bent
apparently
upon
amusement
,
and
tolerably
certain
of
finding
it
.
<EOS>
Through
these
various
groups
numerous
lackeys
were
passing
swiftly
and
continuously
to
and
fro
,
bearing
a
cap
,
a
mantle
,
or
a
sword
,
and
pushing
aside
all
who
interfered
with
their
progress
,
with
a
"
by
your
leave
,
my
masters
--
your
pardon
,
fair
mistress"--or
,
"
out
of
my
way
,
knave
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
as
the
stables
occupied
one
entire
angle
of
the
court
,
there
were
grooms
without
end
dressing
the
horses
at
the
doors
,
watering
them
at
the
troughs
,
or
leading
them
about
amid
the
admiring
or
criticising
bystanders
.
<EOS>
The
King
's
horses
were
,
of
course
,
objects
of
special
attraction
,
and
such
as
could
obtain
a
glimpse
of
them
and
of
the
royal
coach
thought
themselves
especially
favoured
.
<EOS>
Besides
what
was
going
forward
below
,
the
windows
looking
into
the
court
were
all
full
of
curious
observers
,
and
much
loud
conversation
took
place
between
those
placed
at
them
and
their
friends
underneath
.
<EOS>
From
all
this
some
idea
will
be
formed
of
the
tremendous
din
that
prevailed
;
but
though
with
much
confusion
there
was
no
positive
disorder
,
still
less
brawling
,
for
yeomen
of
the
guard
being
stationed
at
various
points
,
perfect
order
was
maintained
.
<EOS>
Several
minstrels
,
mummers
,
and
merry
-
makers
,
in
various
fantastic
habits
,
swelled
the
throng
,
enlivening
it
with
their
strains
or
feats
;
and
amongst
other
privileged
characters
admitted
was
a
Tom
o
'
Bedlam
,
a
half
-
crazed
licensed
beggar
,
in
a
singular
and
picturesque
garb
,
with
a
plate
of
tin
engraved
with
his
name
attached
to
his
left
arm
,
and
a
great
ox
's
horn
,
which
he
was
continually
blowing
,
suspended
by
a
leathern
baldric
from
his
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
Nicholas
joined
his
companions
,
than
word
was
given
that
the
king
was
about
to
attend
morning
prayers
in
the
domestic
chapel
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
an
immediate
rush
was
made
in
that
direction
by
the
crowd
;
but
the
greater
part
were
kept
back
by
the
guard
,
who
crossed
their
halberts
to
prevent
their
ingress
,
and
a
few
only
were
allowed
to
enter
the
antechamber
leading
to
the
chapel
,
amongst
whom
were
the
squire
and
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
were
detained
within
it
till
service
was
over
,
and
,
as
prayers
were
read
by
the
Bishop
of
Chester
,
and
the
whole
Court
was
present
,
this
was
a
great
disappointment
to
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
two
very
courtly
personages
came
forth
,
each
bearing
a
white
wand
,
and
,
announcing
that
the
King
was
coming
forth
,
the
assemblage
immediately
divided
into
two
lines
to
allow
a
passage
for
the
monarch
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
Assheton
informed
Richard
in
a
whisper
that
the
foremost
and
stateliest
of
the
two
gentlemen
was
Lord
Stanhope
of
Harrington
,
the
vice
-
chamberlain
,
and
the
other
,
a
handsome
young
man
of
slight
figure
and
somewhat
libertine
expression
of
countenance
,
was
the
renowned
Sir
John
Finett
,
master
of
the
ceremonies
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
licentiousness
,
however
,
which
was
the
vice
of
the
age
and
the
stain
of
the
court
,
Sir
John
was
a
man
of
wit
and
address
,
and
perfectly
conversant
with
the
duties
of
his
office
,
of
which
he
has
left
satisfactory
evidence
in
an
amusing
tractate
,
"
Finetti
Philoxenis
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Some
little
time
elapsed
before
the
King
made
his
appearance
,
during
which
the
curiosity
of
such
as
had
not
seen
him
,
as
was
the
case
with
Richard
,
was
greatly
excited
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
wondered
whether
the
pedantic
monarch
,
whose
character
perplexed
the
shrewdest
,
would
answer
his
preconceived
notions
,
and
whether
it
would
turn
out
that
his
portraits
were
like
him
.
<EOS>
While
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
mind
,
a
shuffling
noise
was
heard
without
,
and
King
James
appeared
at
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
He
paused
there
for
a
moment
to
place
his
plumed
and
jewelled
cap
upon
his
head
,
and
to
speak
a
word
with
Sir
John
Finett
,
and
during
this
Richard
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
him
.
<EOS>
The
portraits
_
were
_
like
,
but
the
artists
had
flattered
him
,
though
not
much
.
<EOS>
There
was
great
shrewdness
of
look
,
but
there
was
also
a
vacant
expression
,
which
seemed
to
contradict
the
idea
of
profound
wisdom
generally
ascribed
to
him
.
<EOS>
When
in
perfect
repose
,
which
they
were
not
for
more
than
a
minute
,
the
features
were
thoughtful
,
benevolent
,
and
pleasing
,
and
Richard
began
to
think
him
quite
handsome
,
when
another
change
was
wrought
by
some
remark
of
Sir
John
Finett
.
<EOS>
As
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
told
his
tale
,
the
King
's
fine
dark
eyes
blazed
with
an
unpleasant
light
,
and
he
laughed
so
loudly
and
indecorously
at
the
close
of
the
narrative
,
with
his
great
tongue
hanging
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
,
that
the
young
man
was
quite
sickened
.
<EOS>
The
King
's
face
was
thin
and
long
,
the
cheeks
shaven
,
but
the
lips
clothed
with
mustaches
,
and
a
scanty
beard
covered
his
chin
.
<EOS>
The
hair
was
brushed
away
from
the
face
,
and
the
cap
placed
at
the
back
of
the
head
,
so
as
to
exhibit
a
high
bald
forehead
,
of
which
he
was
prodigiously
vain
.
<EOS>
James
was
fully
equipped
for
the
chase
,
and
wore
a
green
silk
doublet
,
quilted
,
as
all
his
garments
were
,
so
as
to
be
dagger
-
proof
,
enormous
trunk
-
hose
,
likewise
thickly
stuffed
,
and
buff
boots
,
fitting
closely
to
the
leg
,
and
turned
slightly
over
at
the
knee
,
with
the
edges
fringed
with
gold
.
<EOS>
This
was
almost
the
only
appearance
of
finery
about
the
dress
,
except
a
row
of
gold
buttons
down
the
jerkin
.
<EOS>
Attached
to
his
girdle
he
wore
a
large
pouch
,
with
the
mouth
drawn
together
by
silken
cords
,
and
a
small
silver
bugle
was
suspended
from
his
neck
by
a
baldric
of
green
silk
.
<EOS>
Stiffly
-
starched
bands
,
edged
with
lace
,
and
slightly
turned
down
on
either
side
of
the
face
,
completed
his
attire
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
majestic
,
but
the
very
reverse
,
in
the
King
's
deportment
,
and
he
seemed
only
kept
upright
by
the
exceeding
stiffness
of
his
cumbersome
clothes
.
<EOS>
With
the
appearance
of
being
corpulent
,
he
was
not
so
in
reality
,
and
his
weak
legs
and
bent
knees
were
scarcely
able
to
support
his
frame
.
<EOS>
He
always
used
a
stick
,
and
generally
sought
the
additional
aid
of
a
favourite
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
instance
the
person
selected
was
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
the
eldest
son
of
Sir
Richard
,
and
subsequent
owner
of
Hoghton
Tower
.
<EOS>
Indebted
for
the
high
court
favour
he
enjoyed
partly
to
his
graceful
person
and
accomplishments
,
and
partly
to
his
marriage
,
having
espoused
a
daughter
of
Sir
John
Aston
of
Cranford
,
who
,
as
sister
of
the
Duchess
of
Buckingham
,
and
a
descendant
of
the
blood
royal
of
the
Stuarts
,
was
a
great
help
to
his
rapid
rise
,
the
handsome
young
knight
was
skilled
in
all
manly
exercises
,
and
cited
as
a
model
of
grace
in
the
dance
.
<EOS>
Constant
in
attendance
upon
the
court
,
he
frequently
took
part
in
the
masques
performed
before
it
.
<EOS>
Like
the
King
,
he
was
fully
equipped
for
hunting
;
but
greater
contrast
could
not
have
been
found
than
between
his
tall
fine
form
and
the
King
's
ungainly
figure
.
<EOS>
Sir
Gilbert
had
remained
behind
with
the
rest
of
the
courtiers
in
the
chapel
;
but
,
calling
him
,
James
seized
his
arm
,
and
set
forward
at
his
usual
shambling
pace
.
<EOS>
As
he
went
on
,
nodding
his
head
in
return
to
the
profound
salutations
of
the
assemblage
,
his
eye
rolled
round
them
until
it
alighted
on
Richard
Assheton
,
and
,
nudging
Sir
Gilbert
,
he
asked--
 
<EOS>
"
Wha
's
that?--a
bonnie
lad
,
but
waesome
pale
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Gilbert
,
however
,
was
unable
to
answer
the
inquiry
;
but
Nicholas
,
who
stood
beside
the
young
man
,
was
determined
not
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
introducing
him
,
and
accordingly
moved
a
step
forward
,
and
made
a
profound
obeisance
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
youth
,
may
it
please
your
Majesty
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
my
cousin
,
Richard
Assheton
,
son
and
heir
of
Sir
Richard
Assheton
of
Middleton
,
one
of
your
Majesty
's
most
loyal
and
devoted
servants
,
and
who
,
I
trust
,
will
have
the
honour
of
being
presented
to
you
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
trust
so
,
too
,
Maister
Nicholas
Assheton
--
for
that
,
if
we
dinna
forget
,
is
your
ain
name
,
"
replied
James
;
"
and
if
the
sire
resembles
the
son
,
whilk
is
not
always
the
case
,
as
our
gude
freend
,
Sir
Gilbert
,
is
evidence
,
being
as
unlike
his
worthy
father
as
a
man
weel
can
be
;
if
,
as
we
say
,
Sir
Richard
resembles
this
callant
,
he
must
be
a
weel
-
faur'd
gentleman
.
<EOS>
But
,
God
's
santie

lad

<EOS>
how
cam
you
in
sic
sad
and
sombre
abulyiements
?
<EOS>
Hae
ye
<EOS>
nae
braw
claes
to
put
on
to
grace
our
coming

<EOS>
Black
isna
the
fashion
at
our
court
,
as
Sir
Gilbert
will
tell
ye
,
and
,
though
a
suit
<EOS>
o
'
sables
may
become
you
,
it
's
no
pleasing
in
our
sight
.
<EOS>
Let
us
see
you
in
gayer
apparel
at
dinner
.
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
,
who
was
considerably
embarrassed
by
the
royal
address
,
merely
bowed
,
and
Nicholas
again
took
upon
himself
to
answer
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Majesty
will
be
pleased
to
pardon
him
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
he
is
unaccustomed
to
court
fashions
,
having
passed
all
his
time
in
a
wild
and
uncivilized
district
,
where
,
except
on
rare
and
happy
occasions
like
the
present
,
the
refined
graces
of
life
seldom
reach
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
,
we
wouldna
be
hard
upon
him
,
"
said
the
King
,
good
-
naturedly
;
"
and
mayhap
the
family
has
sustained
some
recent
loss
,
and
he
is
in
mourning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
offer
that
excuse
for
him
,
sire
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
who
began
to
flatter
himself
<EOS>
he
was
making
considerable
progress
in
the
monarch
's
good
graces
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
simply
an
affair
of
the
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Puir
chiel
!
<EOS>
we
pity

cried
the
King
.
"
<EOS>
And
sae
it
is
a
hopeless
suit

young
sir

<EOS>
"
he
added
to
Richard
.
"
<EOS>
Canna

throw
in
a
good

<EOS>
Do

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
your
Majesty
's
questions
,
"
replied
Richard
,
"
and
my
cousin
Nicholas
has
very
unfairly
betrayed
my
secret

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hoot

toot

<EOS>
na

exclaimed
James
;
"
it
wasna
he
wha
betrayed
your

our

that
revealed
it
to

We
kenned
your

at
a
glance

<EOS>
Few
things
are
hidden
from
the

tell

other

break

though
the
latter
should

Later

"
Oh

cried
Richard

<EOS>
"
Her

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
What

exclaimed
James

"
The

replied
Nicholas

much
surprised
at
the
extent

information
manifested
by

<EOS>
"
cried
the
King
,
with
a
look
of
abhorrence
;
"
a
mischievous
and
malignant
vermin
,
with
which
this
pairt
of
our
realm
is
sair
plagued
,
but
which
,
with
God
's
help
,
we
will
thoroughly
extirpate
.
<EOS>
Sae
the
lass
is
a
daughter
of
Alice
Nutter
,
ha
!
<EOS>
That
accounts
for
your
grewsome
looks
,
lad
.
<EOS>
Odd
's
life
!
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
now
.
<EOS>
I
understand
what
is
the
matter
with
you
.
<EOS>
Look
at
him
,
Sir
Gilbert
--
look
at
him
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
Does
naething
strike
you
as
strange
about
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
than
that
he
is
naturally
embarrassed
by
your
Majesty
's
mode
of
speech
,
"
replied
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
lack
the
penetration
of
the
King
,
Sir
Gilbert
,
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
ails
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
bewitchit
--
forespoken
.
"
 
<EOS>
Exclamations
were
uttered
by
all
the
bystanders
,
and
every
eye
was
fixed
on
Richard
,
who
felt
ready
to
sink
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
affirm
he
is
bewitchit
,
"
continued
the
King
;
"
and
wha
sae
likely
to
do
it
as
the
glamouring
hizzie
that
has
ensnared
him
?
<EOS>
She
has
ill
bluid
in
her
veins
,
and
can
chant
deevil
's
cantrips
as
weel
as
the
mither

or
ony
gyre

carline
o

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
sire
,
"
cried
Richard
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
Alizon
will
be
here
to
-
day
with
my
father
and
sister
,
and
,
if
you
deign
to
receive
her
,
I
am
sure
you
will
judge
her
differently
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
perpend
the
point
of
receiving
her
,
"
replied
the
King
,
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
But
we
are
rarely
mista'en
,
young
man
,
and
seldom
change
our
opinion
except
upon
gude
grounds
,
and
those
you
arena
like
to
offer
us
.
<EOS>
Belike
ye
hae
been
lang
ill
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
,
your
Majesty
,
I
was
suddenly
seized
,
about
a
month
ago
,
"
replied
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suddenly
seized
--
eh
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
James
,
winking
cunningly
at
those
near
him
;
"
and
ye
swarfit
awa
'
<EOS>
wi
'
the
pain
?
<EOS>
I
guessed
it
.
<EOS>
And
whaur
was
Alizon
the
while
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
that
time
she
was
a
guest
at
Middleton
,
"
replied
Richard
;
"
but
it
is
impossible
my
illness
can
in
any
way
be
attributed
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
answer
with
my
life
for
her
perfect
innocence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
to
answer
wi
'
your
life
for
your
misplaced
faith
in
her
,
"
said
the
King
;
"
but
I
tell
you
naething
--
<EOS>
naething
wicked
,
at
all
events
--
is
impossible
to
witches
,
and
the
haill
case
,
even
by
your
own
showin
'
,
is
very
suspicious
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
somewhat
of
the
story
of
Alice
Nutter
,
but
not
the
haill
truth
--
but
there
are
folk
here
<EOS>
wha
can
enlighten
us
mair
fully
.
<EOS>
Thus
much
I
do
ken
--
that
she
is
a
notorious
witch
,
and
a
fugitive
from
justice
;
though
siblins
you
,
Maister
Nicholas
Assheton
,
could
give
an
inkling
of
her
hiding

place
if
you
were
so
disposed

<EOS>
Nay

never

doited

he
added
,
laughing
,
"
I
bring
nae
charges
against
you

<EOS>
Ye
arena
on
your
trial
<EOS>
noo

<EOS>
But
this
is
a
serious
matter
,

maun
be
seriously
considered

it

You

Alizon

Maister

<EOS>
"

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
Nay

continued
James

<EOS>
"
We

our

Richard

<EOS>
"
And
mine

Nicholas

"

<EOS>

rejoined
the
King
,
laughing

and
shuffling
on

<EOS>
"
But
we

our

"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Majesty
talks

going

is
famished

"
observed
Nicholas
to
Sherborne
,
as
the
King
departed
;

he

completely

No

CHAPTER
VII.--THE
ROYAL
DECLARATION
CONCERNING
LAWFUL
SPORTS
ON
THE
SUNDAY
.
  
<EOS>
Not
many
paces
after
the
King
marched
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
then
in
the
zenith
of
his
power
,
and
in
the
full
perfection
of
his
unequalled
beauty
,
eclipsing
all
the
rest
of
the
nobles
in
splendour
of
apparel
,
as
he
did
in
stateliness
of
deportment
.
<EOS>
Haughtily
returning
the
salutations
made
him
,
which
were
scarcely
less
reverential
than
those
addressed
to
the
monarch
himself
,
the
prime
favourite
moved
on
,
all
eyes
following
his
majestic
figure
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
walked
alone
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
prince
of
the
blood
;
but
after
him
came
a
throng
of
nobles
,
consisting
of
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
,
high
chamberlain
;
the
Duke
of
Richmond
,
master
of
the
household
;
the
Earl
of
Nottingham
,
lord
high
admiral
;
Viscount
Brackley
,
Lord
Howard
of
Effingham
,
Lord
Zouche
,
president
of
Wales
;
with
the
Lords
Knollys
,
Mordaunt
,
Conipton
,
and
Grey
of
Groby
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
the
noblemen
seemed
inclined
to
question
Richard
as
to
what
had
passed
between
him
and
the
King
;
but
the
young
man
's
reserved
and
somewhat
stern
manner
deterred
them
.
<EOS>
Next
came
the
three
judges
,
Doddridge
,
Crooke
,
and
Hoghton
,
whose
countenances
wore
an
enforced
gravity
;
for
if
any
faith
could
be
placed
in
rubicund
cheeks
and
portly
persons
,
they
were
not
indisposed
to
self
-
indulgence
and
conviviality
.
<EOS>
After
the
judges
came
the
Bishop
of
Chester
,
the
King
's
chaplain
,
who
had
officiated
on
the
present
occasion
,
and
who
was
in
his
full
pontifical
robes
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
the
lord
of
the
mansion
,
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
a
hale
handsome
man
between
fifty
and
sixty
,
with
silvery
hair
and
beard
,
a
robust
but
commanding
person
,
a
fresh
complexion
,
and
features
,
by
no
means
warranting
,
from
any
marked
dissimilarity
to
those
of
his
son
,
the
King
's
scandalous
jest
.
 
<EOS>
A
crowd
of
baronets
and
knights
succeeded
,
including
Sir
Arthur
Capel
,
Sir
Thomas
Brudenell
,
Sir
Edward
Montague
,
Sir
Edmund
Trafford
,
sheriff
of
the
county
,
Sir
Edward
Mosley
,
and
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
.
<EOS>
The
latter
looked
grave
and
anxious
,
and
,
as
he
passed
his
relatives
,
said
in
a
low
tone
to
Richard--
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
told
Alizon
is
to
be
here
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Is
it
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
,
"
replied
the
young
man
;
"
but
why
do
you
ask
?
<EOS>
Is
she
in
danger
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
let
her
be
warned
against
coming
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
,
"
replied
Sir
Ralph
;
"
that
would
only
increase
the
suspicion
already
attaching
to
her
.
<EOS>
No
;
she
must
face
the
danger
,
and
I
hope
will
be
able
to
avert
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
_
is
_
the
danger
?
"
asked
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
Heaven
's
name
,
speak
more
plainly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
do
so
now
,
"
replied
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
take
counsel
together
anon
.
<EOS>
Her
enemies
are
at
work
;
and
,
if
you
tarry
here
a
few
minutes
longer
,
you
will
understand
whom
I
mean
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
passed
on
.
 
<EOS>
A
large
crowd
now
poured
indiscriminately
out
of
the
chapel
and
amongst
it
Nicholas
perceived
many
of
his
friends
and
neighbours
,
Mr.
Townley
of
Townley
Park
,
Mr.
Parker
of
Browsholme
,
Mr.
Shuttleworth
of
Gawthorpe
,
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
,
and
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
With
the
latter
was
Master
Potts
,
and
Richard
was
then
at
no
loss
to
understand
against
whom
Sir
Ralph
had
warned
him
.
<EOS>
A
fierce
light
blazed
in
Roger
Nowell
's
keen
eyes
as
he
first
remarked
the
two
Asshetons
,
and
a
smile
of
gratified
vengeance
played
about
his
lips
;
but
he
quelled
the
fire
in
a
moment
,
and
,
compressing
his
hard
mouth
more
closely
,
bowed
coldly
and
ceremoniously
to
them
.
<EOS>
Metcalfe
did
the
same
.
<EOS>
Not
so
Master
Potts
.
<EOS>
Halting
for
a
moment
,
he
said
,
with
a
spiteful
look
,
"
Look
to
yourself
,
Master
Nicholas
;
and
you
too
,
Master
Richard
.
<EOS>
A
day
of
reckoning
is
coming
for
both
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
this
he
sprang
nimbly
after
his
client
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
means
the
fellow
?
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
But
that
we
are
here
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
precincts
of
a
palace
,
I
would
after
him
and
cudgel
him
soundly
for
his
insolence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
wha
's
that
ye'd
be
after
dinging
,
man
?
<EOS>
"
cried
a
sharp
voice
behind
him
.
"
<EOS>
No
that
puir
feckless
body
that
has
jist
skippit
aff
.
<EOS>
If
sae
,
ye'll
tak
the
wrang
soo
by
the
lugg
,
and
I
counsel
you
to
let
him
bide
,
for
he
's
high
<EOS>
i
'
favour
<EOS>
wi
'
the
King
.
"
 
<EOS>
Turning
at
this
address
,
Nicholas
recognised
the
king
's
jester
,
Archie
Armstrong
,
a
merry
little
knave
,
with
light
blue
eyes
,
long
yellow
hair
hanging
about
his
ears
,
and
a
sandy
beard
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
deal
of
mother
wit
about
Archie
,
and
quite
as
much
shrewdness
as
folly
.
<EOS>
He
wore
no
distinctive
dress
as
jester
--
the
bauble
and
coxcomb
having
been
long
discontinued
--
but
was
simply
clad
in
the
royal
livery
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
Master
Potts
is
in
favour
with
his
Majesty
,
eh
,
Archie
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
squire
,
hoping
to
obtain
some
information
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
sae
war
you
<EOS>
the
day
efore
yesterday
,
when
you
hunted
at
Myerscough
,
"
replied
the
jester
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
how
have
I
forfeited
the
King
's
good
opinion
?
"
asked
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
you
are
a
good
fellow
,
Archie
,
and
will
tell
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dinna
think
to
fleech
me
,
man
,
"
replied
the
jester
,
<EOS>
cunningly.--"I
ken
what
I
ken
,
and
that
's
mair
than
you
'll
get
frae
me
<EOS>
wi
'
a
'
your
speering
.
<EOS>
The
King
's
secrets
are
safe
wi
'
Archie
--
and
for
a
good
reason
,
that
he
is
never
tauld
them
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
gude
huntsman
,
and
sae
is
his
Majesty
;
but
there
's
ae
<EOS>
kind
o
'
game
<EOS>
he
likes
better
than
anither
,
and
that
's
to
be
found
maistly
i
'
these
pairts
--
I
mean
witches
,
and
sic
like
fearfu
'
carlines
.
<EOS>
We
maun
hae
<EOS>
the
country
rid
o
'
them
,
and
that
's
what
his
Majesty
intends
,
and
if
you
're
a
wise
man
you
'll
lend
him
a
helping
hand
.
<EOS>
But
I
maun
in
to
disjune
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
this
the
jester
capered
off
,
leaving
Nicholas
like
one
stupefied
.
<EOS>
He
was
roused
,
however
,
by
a
smart
slap
on
the
shoulder
from
Sir
John
Finett
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
pondering
over
the
masque
,
Master
Nicholas
,
or
thinking
of
the
petition
you
have
to
present
to
his
Majesty
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
,
"
Let
neither
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
The
one
will
be
well
played
,
I
doubt
not
,
and
the
other
well
received
,
I
am
sure
,
for
I
know
the
king
's
sentiments
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
But
touching
the
dame
,
Master
Nicholas
--
have
you
found
one
willing
and
able
to
take
part
in
the
masque
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
several
willing
,
Sir
John
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
but
as
to
their
ability
that
is
another
question
.
<EOS>
However
,
one
of
them
may
do
as
a
make
-
shift
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
in
the
base
court
,
and
shall
wait
on
you
when
you
please
,
and
then
you
can
make
your
election
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
far
well
,
"
replied
Finett
;
"
it
may
be
that
we
shall
have
Ben
Jonson
here
to
-
day
--
rare
Ben
,
the
prince
of
poets
and
masque
-
writers
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
expects
him
.
<EOS>
Ben
is
preparing
a
masque
for
Christmas
,
to
be
called
'
The
Vision
of
Delight
,
'
in
which
his
highness
the
prince
is
to
be
a
principal
actor
,
and
some
verses
which
have
been
recited
to
me
are
amongst
the
daintiest
ever
indited
by
the
bard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
singular
pleasure
to
me
to
see
him
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
"
for
I
hold
Ben
Jonson
in
the
highest
esteem
as
a
poet
--
ay
,
above
them
all
,
unless
it
be
Will
Shakspeare
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
you
do
well
to
except
Shakspeare
,
"
rejoined
Sir
John
Finett
.
<EOS>
"
Great
as
Ben
Jonson
is
,
and
for
wit
and
learning
no
man
surpasses
him
,
he
is
not
to
be
compared
with
Shakspeare
,
who
for
profound
knowledge
of
nature
,
and
of
all
the
highest
qualities
of
dramatic
art
,
is
unapproachable
.
<EOS>
But
ours
is
a
learned
court
,
Master
Nicholas
,
and
therefore
we
have
a
learned
poet
;
but
a
right
good
fellow
is
Ben
Jonson
,
and
<EOS>
a
boon
companion
,
though
somewhat
prone
to
sarcasm
,
as
you
will
find
if
you
drink
with
him
.
<EOS>
Over
his
cups
he
will
rail
at
courts
and
courtiers
in
good
set
terms
,
I
promise
you
,
and
I
myself
have
come
in
for
his
gibes
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
love
him
none
the
less
for
his
quips
,
for
I
know
it
is
his
humour
to
utter
them
,
and
so
overlook
what
in
another
and
less
deserving
person
I
should
assuredly
resent
.
<EOS>
But
is
not
that
young
man
,
who
is
now
going
forth
,
your
cousin
,
Richard
Assheton
?
<EOS>
I
thought
so
.
<EOS>
The
King
has
had
a
strange
tale
whispered
in
his
ear
,
that
the
youth
has
been
bewitched
by
a
maiden
--
Alizon
Nutter
,
I
think
she
is
named
--
of
whom
he
is
enamoured
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
truth
may
be
in
the
charge
,
but
the
youth
himself
seems
to
warrant
it
,
for
he
looks
ghastly
ill
.
<EOS>
A
letter
was
sent
to
his
Majesty
at
Myerscough
,
communicating
this
and
certain
other
particulars
with
which
I
am
not
acquainted
;
but
I
know
they
relate
to
some
professors
of
the
black
art
in
your
country
,
the
soil
of
which
seems
favourable
to
the
growth
of
such
noxious
weeds
,
and
at
first
he
was
much
disturbed
by
it
,
but
in
the
end
decided
that
both
parties
should
be
brought
hither
without
being
made
aware
of
his
design
,
that
he
might
see
and
judge
for
himself
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
a
messenger
was
sent
over
to
Middleton
Hall
as
from
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
inviting
the
whole
family
to
the
Tower
,
and
giving
Sir
Richard
Assheton
to
understand
it
was
the
King
's
pleasure
<EOS>
he
should
bring
with
him
a
certain
young
damsel
,
named
Alizon
Nutter
,
of
whom
mention
had
been
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
had
no
choice
but
to
obey
,
and
promised
compliance
with
his
Majesty
's
injunctions
.
<EOS>
An
officer
,
however
,
was
left
on
the
watch
,
and
this
very
morning
reported
to
his
Majesty
that
young
Richard
Assheton
had
already
set
out
with
the
intention
of
going
to
Preston
,
but
had
passed
the
night
at
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
,
and
that
Sir
Richard
,
his
daughter
Dorothy
,
and
Alizon
Nutter
,
would
be
here
before
noon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Majesty
has
laid
his
plans
carefully
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
and
I
can
easily
conjecture
from
whom
he
received
the
information
,
which
is
as
false
as
it
is
malicious
.
<EOS>
But
are
you
aware
,
Sir
John
,
upon
what
evidence
the
charge
is
supported
--
for
mere
suspicion
is
not
enough
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
cases
of
witchcraft
suspicion
_
is
_
enough
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
Slender
proofs
are
required
.
<EOS>
The
girl
is
the
daughter
of
a
notorious
witch
--
<EOS>
that
is
against
her
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
is
ailing
--
that
is
against
her
,
too
.
<EOS>
But
a
witness
,
I
believe
,
will
be
produced
,
though
who
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
what
wickedness
there
must
be
in
the
world
when
such
a
charge
can
be
brought
against
one
so
good
and
so
unoffending
,
"
cried
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
maiden
more
devout
than
Alizon
never
existed
,
nor
one
holding
the
crime
she
is
charged
with
in
greater
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
She
injure
Richard
!
<EOS>
she
would
lay
down
her
life
for
him
--
and
would
have
been
his
wife
,
but
for
scruples
the
most
delicate
and
disinterested
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
establish
her
innocence
before
his
Majesty
,
and
confound
her
enemies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
with
that
hope
that
I
have
given
you
this
information
,
sir
,
of
which
I
am
sure
you
will
make
no
improper
use
,
"
replied
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
a
similar
character
to
that
you
have
given
of
Alizon
,
and
am
unwilling
she
should
fall
a
victim
to
art
or
malice
.
<EOS>
Be
upon
your
guard
,
too
,
Master
Nicholas
;
for
other
investigations
will
take
place
at
the
same
time
,
and
some
matters
may
come
forth
in
which
you
are
concerned
.
<EOS>
The
King
's
arms
are
long
,
and
reach
and
strike
far
--
and
his
eyes
see
clearly
when
not
hoodwinked
--
or
when
other
people
see
for
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
good
sir
,
you
must
want
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Here
Faryngton
,
"
he
added
to
an
attendant
,
"
show
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
to
his
lodging
in
the
base
court
,
and
attend
upon
him
as
if
he
were
your
master
.
<EOS>
I
will
come
for
you
,
sir
,
when
it
is
time
to
present
the
petition
to
the
King
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
bowed
and
walked
forth
,
turning
into
the
upper
quadrangle
,
while
Nicholas
followed
Faryngton
into
the
lower
court
,
where
he
found
his
friends
waiting
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Speedily
ascertaining
where
their
lodgings
were
situated
,
Faryngton
led
them
to
a
building
on
the
left
,
almost
opposite
to
the
great
bonfire
,
and
,
ascending
a
flight
of
steps
,
ushered
them
into
a
commodious
and
well
-
furnished
room
,
looking
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
disappeared
,
but
soon
afterwards
returned
with
two
yeomen
of
the
kitchen
,
one
carrying
a
tray
of
provisions
upon
his
head
,
and
the
other
sustaining
a
basket
of
wine
under
his
arm
,
and
a
snowy
napkin
being
laid
upon
the
table
,
trenchers
viands
,
and
flasks
were
soon
arranged
in
very
tempting
order
--
<EOS>
so
tempting
,
indeed
,
that
the
squire
,
notwithstanding
his
assertion
,
that
his
appetite
had
been
taken
away
,
fell
to
work
with
his
customary
vigour
,
and
plied
a
flask
of
excellent
Bordeaux
so
incessantly
,
that
another
had
to
be
placed
before
him
.
<EOS>
Sherborne
did
equal
justice
to
the
good
cheer
,
and
Richard
not
only
forced
himself
to
eat
,
but
to
the
squire
's
great
surprise
swallowed
more
than
one
deep
draught
of
wine
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
administered
to
the
wants
of
the
guests
,
and
seeing
his
presence
was
no
longer
either
necessary
or
desired
,
Faryngton
vanished
,
first
promising
to
go
and
see
that
all
was
got
ready
for
them
in
the
sleeping
apartments
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
man
's
civility
,
there
was
an
over
-
officiousness
about
him
that
made
Nicholas
suspect
he
was
placed
over
them
by
Sir
John
Finett
to
watch
their
movements
,
and
he
resolved
to
be
upon
his
guard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
drink
,
lad
,
"
he
observed
to
Richard
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
;
"
a
cup
of
wine
will
do
you
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Richard
,
filling
his
goblet
anew
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
get
back
my
spirits
and
strength
--
to
sustain
myself
no
matter
how
--
to
look
well
--
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
If
I
can
only
make
this
frail
machine
carry
me
stoutly
through
the
King
's
visit
,
I
care
not
how
soon
it
falls
to
pieces
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
your
motive
,
Dick
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
You
hope
to
turn
away
suspicion
from
Alizon
by
this
device
;
but
you
must
not
go
to
excess
,
or
you
will
defeat
your
scheme
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
something
to
convince
the
King
<EOS>
he
is
mistaken
in
me
--
<EOS>
that
I
am
not
bewitched
,
"
cried
Richard
,
rising
and
striding
across
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Bewitched
!
<EOS>
and
by
Alizon
,
too
!
<EOS>
I
could
laugh
at
the
charge
,
but
that
it
is
too
horrible
.
<EOS>
Had
any
other
than
the
King
breathed
it
,
I
would
have
slain
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
Majesty
has
been
abused
by
the
malice
of
that
knavish
attorney
,
Potts
,
who
has
always
manifested
the
greatest
hostility
towards
Alizon
,
"
said
Nicholas
;
"
but
he
will
not
prevail
,
for
she
has
only
to
show
herself
to
dispel
all
prejudice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Nicholas
,
"
cried
Richard
;
"
and
yet
the
King
seems
already
to
have
prejudged
her
,
and
his
obstinacy
may
lead
to
her
destruction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
not
so
loudly
,
Dick
,
in
Heaven
's
name
!
"
said
the
squire
,
in
alarm
;
"
these
walls
may
have
ears
,
and
echoes
may
repeat
every
word
you
utter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
let
them
tell
the
King
that
Alizon
is
innocent
,
"
cried
Richard
,
stopping
,
and
replenishing
his
goblet
,
"
<EOS>
Here
's
to
her
health
,
and
confusion
to
her
enemies
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
drink
that
toast
with
pleasure
,
Dick
,
"
replied
the
squire
;
"
but
I
must
forbid
you
more
wine
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
used
to
it
,
and
the
fumes
will
mount
to
your
brain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
and
sit
down
beside
us
,
that
we
may
talk
,
"
said
Sherborne
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
obeyed
,
and
,
leaning
over
the
table
,
asked
in
a
low
deep
tone
,
"
Where
is
Mistress
Nutter
,
Nicholas
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
squire
looked
towards
the
door
before
he
answered
,
and
then
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
After
the
destruction
of
Malkin
Tower
and
the
band
of
robbers
,
she
was
taken
to
a
solitary
hut
near
Barley
Booth
,
at
the
foot
of
Pendle
Hill
,
and
the
next
day
was
conveyed
across
Bowland
Forest
to
Poulton
in
the
Fyld
,
on
the
borders
of
Morecambe
Bay
,
with
the
intention
of
getting
her
on
board
some
vessel
bound
for
the
Isle
of
Man
.
<EOS>
Arrangements
were
made
for
this
purpose
;
but
when
the
time
came
,
she
refused
to
go
,
and
was
brought
secretly
back
to
the
hut
near
Barley
,
where
she
has
been
ever
since
,
though
her
place
of
concealment
was
hidden
even
from
you
and
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
captain
of
the
robbers
,
Fogg
or
Demdike
,
escaped
--
did
he
not
?
"
said
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
in
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
blowing
up
of
the
Tower
he
managed
to
get
away
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
and
we
were
unable
to
follow
him
,
as
our
attentions
had
to
be
bestowed
upon
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
more
unlucky
,
as
through
his
instrumentality
Jem
and
his
mother
Elizabeth
were
liberated
from
the
dungeon
in
which
they
were
placed
in
Whalley
Abbey
,
prior
to
their
removal
to
Lancaster
Castle
,
and
none
of
them
have
been
heard
of
since
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
hope
will
never
be
heard
of
again
,
"
cried
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
But
is
Mistress
Nutter
's
retreat
secure
,
think
you?--May
it
not
be
discovered
by
some
of
Nowell
's
emissaries
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
not
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
but
her
voluntary
surrender
is
more
to
be
apprehended
,
for
when
I
last
saw
her
,
on
the
night
before
starting
for
Myerscough
,
she
told
me
she
was
determined
to
give
herself
up
for
trial
;
and
her
motives
could
scarce
be
combated
,
for
she
declares
that
,
unless
she
submits
herself
to
the
justice
of
man
,
and
expiates
her
offences
,
she
can
not
be
saved
.
<EOS>
She
now
seems
as
resolute
in
good
as
she
was
heretofore
resolute
in
evil
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
she
perishes
thus
,
her
self
-
sacrifice
,
for
thus
it
becomes
,
will
be
Alizon
's
death
-
blow
,
"
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
told
her
,
"
replied
Nicholas--"but
<EOS>
she
continued
inflexible
.
'
<EOS>
I
am
born
to
be
the
cause
of
misery
to
others
,
and
most
to
those
I
love
most
,
'
she
said
;
'
but
I
can
not
fly
from
justice
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
escape
for
me
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
right
,
"
cried
Richard
;
"
there
is
no
escape
but
the
grave
<EOS>
,
whither
we
are
all
three
hurrying
.
<EOS>
A
terrible
fatality
attaches
to
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
say
not
so
,
Dick
,
"
rejoined
Nicholas
;
"
you
are
young
,
and
,
though
this
shock
may
be
severe
,
yet
when
it
is
passed
,
you
will
be
recompensed
,
I
hope
,
by
many
years
of
happiness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
to
be
deceived
,
"
said
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Look
me
in
the
face
,
and
say
honestly
if
you
think
me
long
-
lived
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
smitten
by
a
mortal
illness
,
and
am
wasting
gradually
away
.
<EOS>
I
am
dying
--
<EOS>
I
feel
it
--
<EOS>
know
it
;
but
though
it
may
abridge
my
brief
term
of
life
,
I
will
purchase
present
health
and
spirits
at
any
cost
,
and
save
Alizon
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
putting
his
hand
to
his
heart
,
with
a
fearful
expression
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
cried
the
two
gentlemen
,
greatly
alarmed
,
and
springing
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
young
man
could
not
reply
.
<EOS>
Another
and
another
agonising
spasm
shook
his
frame
,
and
cold
damps
broke
out
upon
his
pallid
brow
,
showing
the
intensity
of
his
suffering
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
and
Sherborne
regarded
each
other
anxiously
,
as
if
doubtful
how
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
summon
assistance
?
"
said
the
latter
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
But
,
softly
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
they
reached
the
ears
of
Richard
.
<EOS>
Rousing
himself
by
a
great
effort
,
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
--
the
fit
is
over
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
it
has
seized
me
now
,
for
I
shall
not
be
liable
to
a
recurrence
of
it
throughout
the
day
.
<EOS>
Lead
me
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
air
will
presently
revive
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
friends
complied
with
the
request
,
and
placed
him
at
the
open
casement
.
 
<EOS>
Great
bustle
was
observable
below
,
and
the
cause
was
soon
manifest
,
as
the
chief
huntsman
,
clad
in
green
,
with
buff
boots
drawn
high
up
on
the
thigh
,
a
horn
about
his
neck
,
and
mounted
on
a
strong
black
curtal
,
rode
forth
from
the
stables
.
<EOS>
He
was
attended
by
a
noble
bloodhound
,
and
on
gaining
the
middle
of
the
court
,
put
his
bugle
to
his
lips
,
and
blew
a
loud
blithe
call
that
made
the
walls
ring
again
.
<EOS>
The
summons
was
immediately
answered
by
a
number
of
grooms
and
pages
,
leading
a
multitude
of
richly
-
caparisoned
horses
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
court
,
where
a
gallant
troop
of
dames
,
nobles
,
and
gentlemen
,
all
attired
for
the
chase
,
awaited
them
;
and
where
,
amidst
much
mirth
,
and
bandying
of
lively
jest
and
compliment
,
a
general
mounting
took
place
,
the
ladies
,
of
course
,
being
placed
first
on
their
steeds
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
forward
,
the
hounds
were
brought
from
the
kennel
in
couples
--
relays
having
been
sent
down
into
the
park
more
than
an
hour
before
--
and
the
yard
resounded
with
their
joyous
baying
,
and
the
neighing
of
the
impatient
steeds
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
also
,
the
chief
huntsman
had
collected
his
forces
,
consisting
of
a
dozen
prickers
,
six
habited
like
himself
in
green
,
and
six
in
russet
,
and
all
mounted
on
stout
curtals
.
<EOS>
Those
in
green
were
intended
to
hunt
the
hart
,
and
those
in
russet
the
wild
-
boar
,
the
former
being
provided
with
hunting
-
poles
,
and
the
latter
with
spears
.
<EOS>
Their
girdles
were
well
lined
with
beef
and
pudding
,
and
each
of
them
,
acting
upon
the
advice
of
worthy
Master
George
Turbervile
,
had
a
stone
bottle
of
good
wine
at
the
pummel
of
his
saddle
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
a
whole
host
of
varlets
of
the
chase
on
foot
.
<EOS>
The
chief
falconer
,
with
a
long
-
winged
hawk
in
her
hood
and
jesses
upon
his
wrist
,
was
stationed
somewhat
near
the
gateway
,
and
close
to
him
were
his
attendants
,
each
having
on
his
fist
a
falcon
gentle
,
a
Barbary
falcon
,
a
merlin
,
a
goshawk
,
or
a
sparrowhawk
.
<EOS>
Thus
all
was
in
readiness
,
and
hound
,
hawk
,
and
man
seemed
equally
impatient
for
the
sport
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
Faryngton
,
who
announced
Sir
John
Finett
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
time
,
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
,
"
said
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
to
attend
you
,
Sir
John
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
taking
a
parchment
from
his
doublet
,
and
unfolding
it
,
"
the
petition
is
well
signed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
see
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
glancing
at
it
.
"
<EOS>
Will
not
your
friends
come
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
assuredly
,
"
replied
Richard
,
who
had
risen
on
the
knight
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
And
he
followed
the
others
down
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
By
direction
of
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
,
nearly
a
hundred
of
the
more
important
gentlemen
of
the
county
had
been
got
together
,
and
this
train
was
subsequently
swelled
to
thrice
the
amount
,
from
the
accessions
it
received
from
persons
of
inferior
rank
when
its
object
became
known
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
this
large
assemblage
Nicholas
was
now
placed
,
and
,
accompanied
by
Sir
John
Finett
,
who
gave
the
word
to
the
procession
to
follow
them
,
he
moved
slowly
up
the
court
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
the
brilliant
crowd
of
equestrians
,
the
procession
halted
at
a
short
distance
from
the
doorway
of
the
great
hall
,
and
James
,
who
had
been
waiting
for
its
approach
within
,
now
came
forth
,
amid
the
cheers
and
plaudits
of
the
spectators
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
Finett
then
led
Nicholas
forward
,
and
the
latter
,
dropping
on
one
knee
,
said--
 
<EOS>
"
May
it
please
your
Majesty
,
I
hold
in
my
hand
a
petition
,
signed
as
,
if
you
will
deign
to
cast
your
eyes
over
it
,
you
will
perceive
,
by
many
hundreds
of
the
lower
orders
of
your
loving
subjects
in
this
your
county
of
Lancaster
,
representing
that
they
are
debarred
from
lawful
recreations
upon
Sunday
after
afternoon
service
,
and
upon
holidays
,
and
praying
that
the
restrictions
imposed
in
1579
,
by
the
Earls
of
Derby
and
Huntingdon
,
and
by
William
,
Bishop
of
Chester
,
commissioners
to
her
late
Highness
,
Elizabeth
,
of
glorious
memory
,
your
Majesty
's
predecessor
,
may
be
withdrawn
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
this
he
placed
in
the
King
's
hands
the
petition
,
which
Was
very
graciously
received
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
complaint
of
our
loving
subjects
in
Lancashire
shall
not
pass
unnoticed
,
sir
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"
Sorry
are
we
to
say
it
,
but
this
county
of
ours
is
sair
infested
wi
'
folk
inclining
to
Puritanism
and
Papistry
,
baith
of
which
sects
are
adverse
to
the
cause
of
true
religion
.
<EOS>
Honest
mirth
is
not
only
tolerable
but
praiseworthy
,
and
the
prohibition
of
it
is
likely
to
breed
discontent
,
and
this
our
enemies
ken
fu
'
weel
;
for
when
,
"
he
continued
,
loudly
and
emphatically--"when
shall
the
common
people
have
leave
to
exercise
if
not
upon
Sundays
and
holidays
,
seeing
they
must
labour
and
win
their
living
on
all
other
days
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Majesty
speaks
like
King
Solomon
himself
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
amid
the
loud
cheering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
will
and
pleasure
<EOS>
then
is
,
"
pursued
James
,
"
that
our
good
people
be
not
deprived
of
any
lawful
recreation
that
shall
not
tend
to
a
breach
of
the
laws
,
or
a
violation
of
the
Kirk
;
but
that
,
after
the
end
of
divine
service
,
they
shall
not
be
disturbed

letted

or
discouraged
from

,
therewith

provided
the

be
had
in
due
and
convenient
time

without
impediment

<EOS>
And
our
will
further
is

have
leave

carry
rushes
to
the
church
,
for
the
decoring

But

<EOS>
"[3
]
 
<EOS>
The
royal
declaration
was
received
with
loud
and
reiterated
cheers
,
amidst
which
James
mounted
his
steed
,
a
large
black
docile
-
looking
charger
,
and
rode
out
of
the
court
,
followed
by
the
whole
cavalcade
.
 
<EOS>
Trumpets
were
sounded
from
the
battlements
as
he
passed
through
the
gateway
,
and
shouting
crowds
attended
him
all
the
way
down
the
hill
,
until
he
entered
the
avenue
leading
to
the
park
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
conclusion
of
the
royal
address
,
the
procession
headed
by
Nicholas
immediately
dispersed
,
and
such
as
meant
to
join
the
chase
set
off
in
quest
of
steeds
.
<EOS>
Foremost
amongst
these
was
the
squire
himself
,
and
on
approaching
the
stables
,
he
was
glad
to
find
Richard
and
Sherborne
already
mounted
,
<EOS>
the
former
holding
his
horse
by
the
bridle
,
so
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
vault
upon
his
back
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
impatience
about
Richard
,
very
different
from
his
ordinary
manner
,
that
surprised
and
startled
him
,
and
the
expression
of
the
young
man
's
countenance
long
afterwards
haunted
him
.
<EOS>
The
face
was
deathly
pale
,
except
that
on
either
cheek
burned
a
red
feverish
spot
,
and
the
eyes
blazed
with
unnatural
light
.
<EOS>
So
much
was
the
squire
struck
by
his
cousin
's
looks
,
that
he
would
have
dissuaded
him
from
going
forth
;
but
he
saw
from
his
manner
that
the
attempt
would
fail
,
while
a
significant
gesture
from
his
brother
-
in
-
law
told
him
he
was
equally
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
principal
nobles
passed
through
the
gateway
,
than
,
in
spite
of
all
efforts
to
detain
him
,
Richard
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
,
and
dashed
amidst
the
cavalcade
,
creating
great
disorder
,
and
rousing
the
ire
of
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
,
to
whom
the
marshalling
of
the
train
was
entrusted
.
<EOS>
But
Richard
paid
little
heed
to
his
wrath
,
and
perhaps
did
not
hear
the
angry
expressions
addressed
to
him
;
for
no
sooner
was
he
outside
the
gate
,
than
instead
of
pursuing
the
road
down
which
the
King
was
proceeding
,
and
which
has
been
described
as
hewn
out
of
the
rock
,
he
struck
into
a
thicket
on
the
right
,
and
,
in
defiance
of
all
attempts
to
stop
him
,
and
at
the
imminent
risk
of
breaking
his
neck
,
rode
down
the
precipitous
sides
of
the
hill
,
and
reaching
the
bottom
in
safety
,
long
before
the
royal
cavalcade
had
attained
the
same
point
,
took
the
direction
of
the
park
.
 
<EOS>
His
friends
watched
him
commence
this
perilous
descent
in
dismay
;
but
,
though
much
alarmed
,
they
were
unable
to
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
lad
!
<EOS>
I
am
fearful
he
has
lost
his
senses
,
"
said
Sherborne
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
what
the
King
would
call
'
fey
,
'
and
not
long
for
this
world
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
shaking
his
head
.

CHAPTER
VIII.--HOW
KING
JAMES
HUNTED
THE
HART
<EOS>
AND
THE
WILD
-
BOAR
IN
HOGHTON
PARK
.
  
<EOS>
Galloping
on
fast
and
furiously
,
Richard
tracked
a
narrow
path
of
greensward
,
lying
between
the
tall
trees
composing
the
right
line
of
the
avenue
and
the
adjoining
wood
.
<EOS>
Within
it
grew
many
fine
old
thorns
,
diverting
him
now
and
then
from
his
course
,
but
he
still
held
on
until
he
came
within
a
short
distance
of
the
chase
,
when
his
attention
was
caught
by
a
very
singular
figure
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
man
,
clad
in
a
robe
of
coarse
brown
serge
,
with
a
cowl
drawn
partly
over
his
head
,
a
rope
girdle
like
that
used
by
a
cordelier
,
sandal
shoon
,
and
a
venerable
white
beard
descending
to
his
waist
.
<EOS>
The
features
of
the
hermit
,
for
such
he
seemed
,
were
majestic
and
benevolent
.
<EOS>
Seated
on
a
bank
overgrown
with
wild
thyme
,
beneath
the
shade
of
a
broad
-
armed
elm
,
he
appeared
so
intently
engaged
in
the
perusal
of
a
large
open
volume
laid
on
his
knee
,
that
he
did
not
notice
Richard
's
approach
.
<EOS>
Deeply
interested
,
however
,
by
his
appearance
,
the
young
man
determined
to
address
him
,
and
,
reining
in
his
horse
,
said
respectfully
,
"
Save
you
,
father
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pass
on
,
my
son
,
"
replied
the
old
man
,
without
raising
his
eyes
,
"
and
hinder
not
my
studies
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Richard
would
not
be
thus
dismissed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perchance
you
are
not
aware
,
father
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
the
King
is
about
to
hunt
within
the
park
this
morning
.
<EOS>
The
royal
cavalcade
has
already
left
Hoghton
Tower
,
and
will
be
here
ere
many
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
king
and
his
retinue
will
pass
along
the
broad
avenue
,
as
you
should
have
done
,
and
not
through
this
retired
road
,
"
replied
the
hermit
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
disturb
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
fain
know
the
subject
of
your
studies
,
father
?
"
inquired
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
inquisitive
,
young
man
,
"
returned
the
hermit
,
looking
up
and
fixing
a
pair
of
keen
grey
eyes
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
will
satisfy
your
curiosity
,
if
by
so
doing
I
shall
rid
me
of
your
presence
.
<EOS>
I
am
reading
the
Book
of
Fate
.
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
in
it
your
destiny
is
written
,
"
pursued
the
old
man
;
"
and
a
sad
one
it
is
.
<EOS>
Consumed
by
a
strange
and
incurable
disease
,
which
may
at
any
moment
prove
fatal
,
you
are
scarcely
likely
to
survive
the
next
three
days
,
in
which
case
she
you
love
better
than
existence
will
perish
miserably
,
being
adjudged
to
have
destroyed
you
by
witchcraft
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
indeed
be
the
Book
of
Fate
that
tells
you
this
,
"
cried
Richard
,
springing
from
his
horse
,
and
approaching
close
to
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
May
I
cast
eyes
upon
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
son
,
"
replied
the
old
man
,
closing
the
volume
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
comprehend
the
mystic
characters
--
but
no
eye
,
except
my
own
,
must
look
upon
them
.
<EOS>
What
is
written
will
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
Again
,
I
bid
you
pass
on
.
<EOS>
I
must
speedily
return
to
my
hermit
cell
in
the
forest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
attend
you
thither
,
father
?
"
asked
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
what
purpose
?
"
rejoined
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
many
hours
of
life
.
<EOS>
Go
,
then
,
and
pass
them
in
the
fierce
excitement
of
the
chase
.
<EOS>
Pull
down
the
lordly
stag
--
slaughter
the
savage
boar
;
and
,
as
you
see
the
poor
denizens
of
the
forest
perish
,
think
that
your
own
end
is
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
that
boding
cry
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
croak
of
a
raven
newly
alighted
in
the
tree
above
us
,
"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
The
sagacious
bird
will
ever
attend
the
huntsman
in
the
chase
,
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
morsel
when
they
break
up
deer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Such
is
the
custom
of
the
bird
I
wot
well
,
"
said
the
old
man
;
"
but
it
is
not
in
joyous
expectation
of
the
raven's
-
bone
that
he
croaks
now
,
but
because
his
fell
instinct
informs
him
that
the
living
-
dead
is
beneath
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
if
in
answer
to
the
remark
,
the
raven
croaked
exultingly
;
and
,
rising
from
the
tree
,
wheeled
in
a
circle
above
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
no
way
of
averting
my
terrible
destiny
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Richard
,
despairingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
if
you
choose
to
adopt
it
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
I
said
your
ailment
was
incurable
,
I
meant
by
ordinary
remedies
,
but
it
will
yield
to
such
as
I
alone
can
employ
.
<EOS>
The
malignant
and
fatal
influence
under
which
you
labour
may
be
removed
,
and
then
your
instant
restoration
to
health
and
vigour
will
follow
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
how
,
father
--
how
?
"
cried
Richard
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
simply
to
sign
your
name
in
this
book
,
"
rejoined
the
hermit
,
"
and
what
you
desire
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
pen
,
"
he
added
,
taking
one
from
his
girdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
ink
?
"
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Prick
your
arm
with
your
dagger
,
and
dip
the
pen
in
the
blood
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
That
will
suffice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
follows
if
I
sign
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Richard
,
staring
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
instant
cure
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
to
drink
of
a
wondrous
elixir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
to
what
do
I
bind
myself
?
"
asked
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
serve
me
,
"
replied
the
hermit
,
smiling
;
"
but
it
is
a
light
service
,
and
only
involves
your
appearance
in
this
wood
once
a
-
year
.
<EOS>
Are
you
agreed
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
replied
the
young
man
distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
make
up
your
mind
speedily
,
"
said
the
hermit
;
"
for
I
hear
the
approach
of
the
royal
cavalcade
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
the
mellow
notes
of
a
bugle
,
followed
by
the
baying
of
hounds
,
the
jingling
of
bridles
,
and
the
trampling
of
a
large
troop
of
horse
,
were
heard
at
a
short
distance
down
the
avenue
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
who
you
are
?
"
cried
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
hermit
of
the
wood
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
Some
people
call
me
Hobthurst
,
and
some
by
other
names
,
but
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
me
out
.
<EOS>
Look
yonder
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
pointing
through
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
glancing
in
the
direction
indicated
,
Richard
beheld
a
small
party
on
horseback
advancing
across
the
plain
,
consisting
of
his
father
,
his
sister
,
and
Alizon
,
with
their
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
she!--'tis
she
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
hesitate
,
when
it
is
to
save
_
her
_
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
help
me
,
or
I
am
lost
!
"
<EOS>
fervently
ejaculated
Richard
,
gazing
on
high
while
making
the
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
looked
down
again
the
old
man
was
gone
,
and
he
saw
only
a
large
black
snake
gliding
off
among
the
bushes
.
<EOS>
Muttering
a
few
words
of
thankfulness
for
his
deliverance
,
he
sprang
upon
his
horse
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
<EOS>
the
arch
-
tempter
is
right
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
that
but
few
hours
of
life
remain
to
me
;
but
if
so
,
they
shall
be
employed
in
endeavours
to
vindicate
Alizon
,
and
defeat
the
snares
by
which
she
is
beset
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
resolve
,
he
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
,
and
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
little
troop
.
<EOS>
Before
,
however
,
he
could
come
up
to
them
,
their
progress
was
arrested
by
a
pursuivant
,
who
,
riding
in
advance
of
the
royal
cavalcade
,
motioned
them
to
stay
till
it
had
passed
,
and
the
same
person
also
perceiving
Richard
's
purpose
,
called
to
him
,
authoritatively
,
to
keep
back
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
might
have
disregarded
the
injunction
,
but
at
the
same
moment
the
King
himself
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
avenue
,
and
remarking
Richard
,
who
was
not
more
than
fifty
yards
off
on
the
right
,
instantly
recognised
him
,
and
shouted
out
,
"
Come
hither
,
young
man
--
come
hither
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
baffled
in
his
design
,
Richard
was
forced
to
comply
,
and
,
uncovering
his
head
,
rode
slowly
towards
the
monarch
.
<EOS>
As
he
approached
,
James
fixed
on
him
a
glance
of
sharpest
scrutiny
.
 
<EOS>
"
Odds
life
!
<EOS>
ye
hae
been
ganging
a
fine
gait
,
young
sir
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
maun
be
demented
to
ride
down
a
hill
<EOS>
i
'
that
fashion
,
<EOS>
and

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Nay

then

I
'll
gi'e

<EOS>
The

will
draw

out

there

strang

<EOS>
Stands

magnet
yonder
,
eh

"
<EOS>
he
added
,
glancing
towards
the
little
group
before
them
.
"
<EOS>
Gude
faith
!
<EOS>
the
lass
maun
be
a
potent
witch
to
exercise
sic
influence
,
and
we
wad
fain
see
the
effect
she
has
on
you
when
near
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
"
he
called
out
to
the
knight
,
who
rode
a
few
paces
behind
him
,
"
we
pray
you
present
Sir
Richard
Assheton
and
his
daughter
to
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
Had
he
dared
so
to
do
,
Richard
would
have
thrown
himself
at
the
King
's
feet
,
but
all
he
could
venture
upon
was
to
say
in
a
low
earnest
tone
,
"
Do
not
prejudge
Alizon
,
sire
.
<EOS>
On
my
soul
she
is
innocent
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
King
prejudges
nae
man
<EOS>
,
"
replied
James
,
in
a
tone
of
rebuke
;
"
and
like
the
wise
prince
of
Israel
,
whom
it
is
his
wish
to
resemble
,
he
sees
with
his
ain
een
,

hears

afore

forms

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
I
can
desire

sire

"
replied
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
Far
be
it
from
me
to
doubt
your
majesty
's
discrimination
or
love
of
justice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ye
shall
hae
proofs

said
James
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah

here
comes
our

an
the
twa

But

We

"
 
<EOS>
The
party
now
came
on
,
and
were
formally
presented
to
the
monarch
by
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Assheton
,
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
,
with
handsome
features
,
though
somewhat
haughty
in
expression
,
and
stately
deportment
,
was
very
graciously
received
,
and
James
thought
fit
to
pay
a
few
compliments
to
Dorothy
,
covertly
regarding
Alizon
<EOS>
the
while
,
yet
not
neglecting
Richard
,
being
ready
to
intercept
any
signal
that
should
pass
between
them
.
<EOS>
None
,
however
,
was
attempted
,
for
the
young
man
felt
he
should
only
alarm
and
embarrass
Alizon
by
any
attempt
to
caution
her
,
and
he
therefore
endeavoured
to
assume
an
unconcerned
aspect
and
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
hae
heard
the
beauty
of
the
Lancashire
lassies
highly
commended
,
"
said
the
King
;
"
but
,
faith
!
<EOS>
it
passes
expectation
.
<EOS>
Twa
lovelier
damsels
than
these
we
never
beheld
.
<EOS>
Baith
are
rare
specimens
o
'
Nature
's
handiwark
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Majesty
is
pleased
to
be
complimentary
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Richard
Assheton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Na
,
Sir
Richard
,
"
returned
James
.
<EOS>
"
We
arena
gien
to
flichtering
,
though
aften
beflummed
oursel
'
.
<EOS>
Baith
are
bonnie
lassies
,
we
repeat
.
<EOS>
An
sae
this
is
Alizon
Nutter
--
it
wad
be
Ailsie
in
our
ain
Scottish
tongue
,
to
which
your
Lancashire
vernacular
closely
approximates
,
Sir
Richard
.
<EOS>
Aweel
,
fair
Alizon
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
eyeing
her
narrowly
,
"
ye
hae
lost
your
mither
,
we
understand
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
girl
was
not
discomposed
by
this
question
,
but
answered
in
a
firm
,
melancholy
tone--"Your
Majesty
,
I
fear
,
is
too
well
acquainted
with
my
unfortunate
mother
's
history
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aweel
,
we
winna
deny
having
heard
somewhat
to
her
disadvantage
,
"
replied
the
King--"but
your
ain
looks
gang
far
to
contradict
the
reports
,
fair
maid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Place
no
faith
in
them
then
,
sire
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
what!--then
you
admit
your
mother
's
guilt
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
King
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
neither
admit
it
nor
deny
it
,
sire
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
for
your
Majesty
to
judge
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
answered
,
"
muttered
<EOS>
James,--"but
I
mustna
forget
,
that
the
deil
himsel
'
can
quote
Scripture
to
serve
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
you
hold
in
abhorrence
the
crime
laid
to
your
mother
's
charge
--
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
utter
abhorrence
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gude
--
vera
gude
,
"
rejoined
the
King
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
entertaining
this
feeling
,
how
conies
it
you
screen
so
heinous
an
offender
frae
justice
?
<EOS>
Nae
natural
feeling
should
be
allowed
to
weigh
in
sic
a
case
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
should
it
,
sire
,
with
me
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Alizon--"because
<EOS>
I
believe
my
poor
mother
's
eternal
welfare
would
be
best
consulted
if
she
underwent
temporal
punishment
.
<EOS>
Neither
is
she
herself
anxious
to
avoid
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
why
does
she
keep
out
of
the
way
--
why
does
she
not
surrender
herself
?
"
cried
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because--
"
and
Alizon
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
what
?
"
demanded
James
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
sire
<EOS>
,
I
must
decline
answering
further
questions
on
the
subject
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whatever
concerns
myself
or
my
mother
alone
,
I
will
state
freely
,
but
I
can
not
compromise
others
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
<EOS>
then
there
are
others
concerned
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
We
thought
as
much
.
<EOS>
We
will
interrogate
you
further
hereafter
--
but
a
word
mair
.
<EOS>
We
trust
ye
are
devout
,
and
constant
in
your
religious
exercises
,
damsel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
that
,
sire
,
"
interposed
Sir
Richard
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alizon
's
whole
time
is
spent
in
prayer
for
her
unfortunate
mother
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
a
fault
it
is
that
she
goes
too
far
,
and
injures
her
health
by
her
zeal
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
gude
fault
that
,
Sir
Richard
,
"
observed
the
King
,
approvingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
beseems
me
not
to
speak
of
myself
,
sire
,
"
said
Alizon
,
"
and
I
am
loth
to
do
so
<EOS>
--
but
I
beseech
your
majesty
to
believe
,
that
if
my
life
might
be
offered
as
an
atonement
for
my
mother
,
I
would
freely
yield
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'
gude
faith
<EOS>
she
staggers
me
in
my
opinion
,
"
muttered
James
,
"
and
I
maun
look
into
the
matter
mair
closely
.
<EOS>
The
lass
is
far
different
frae
what
I
imagined
her
.
<EOS>
But
the
wiles
o
'
Satan
arena
to
be
comprehended
,
and
he
will
put
on
the
semblance
of
righteousness
when
seeking
to
beguile
the
righteous
.

Aweel

damsel

he
added
aloud
,
"
ye
speak
feelingly

properly

we
respect
your

ye
represent

<EOS>
And
now
dispose
yourselves

chase

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
pray
your
Majesty
to
dismiss
me
,

said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
sight
in
which
at
any
time
I
take
small
pleasure

now
it

me

With

I

Dorothy

Richard

Sir
John
Finett

he
added
,
calling
to
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
,
and
speaking
in
his
ear
,
"
see
that
they
be
followed

and
that
a
special
watch
be
kept
over
Alizon
,
and
also
over
this
youth,--d'ye
mark
me?--in
fact
,
ower
a
'
the
Assheton
clan
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
let
them
blaw
the
strake
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
chief
huntsman
having
placed
the
bugle
to
his
lips
,
and
blown
a
strike
with
two
winds
,
a
short
consultation
was
held
between
him
and
James
,
who
loved
to
display
his
knowledge
as
a
woodsman
;
and
while
this
was
going
forward
,
Nicholas
and
Sherborne
having
come
up
,
the
squire
dismounted
,
and
committing
Robin
to
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
approached
the
monarch
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
put
in
a
word
,
my
liege
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
can
show
you
where
a
hart
of
ten
is
assuredly
harboured
.
<EOS>
I
viewed
him
as
I
rode
through
the
park
this
morning
,
and
can
not
,
therefore
,
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
His
head
is
high
and
well
palmed
,
great
beamed
and
in
good
proportion
,
well
burred
and
well
pearled
.
<EOS>
He
is
stately
in
height
,
long
,
and
well
fed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
mark
the
slot
,
sir
?
"
inquired
James
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
"
<EOS>
And
a
long
slot
it
was
;
the
toes
great
,
with
round
short
joint
-
bones
,
large
shin
-
bones
,
and
the
dew
-
claws
close
together
.
<EOS>
I
will
uphold
him
for
a
great
old
hart
as
ever
proffered
,
and
one
that
shall
shew
your
Majesty
rare
sport
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
we
'll
tak
your
word
for
the
matter
,
sir
,
"
said
James
;
"
for
ye're
as
gude
a
woodman
as
any
we
hae
in
our
dominions
.
<EOS>
Bring
us
to
him
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Will
it
please
your
Majesty
to
ride
towards
yon
glade
?
"
said
Nicholas
,
"
and
,
before
you
reach
it
,
the
hart
shall
be
roused
.
"
 
<EOS>
James
,
assenting
to
the
arrangement
,
Nicholas
sprang
upon
his
steed
,
and
,
calling
to
the
chief
huntsman
,
they
galloped
off
together
,
accompanied
by
the
bloodhound
,
the
royal
cavalcade
following
somewhat
more
slowly
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
A
fair
sight
<EOS>
it
was
to
see
that
splendid
company
careering
over
the
plain
,
their
feathered
caps
and
gay
mantles
glittering
in
the
sun
,
which
shone
brightly
upon
them
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
lovely
,
giving
promise
that
the
day
,
when
further
advanced
,
would
be
intensely
hot
,
but
at
present
it
was
fresh
and
delightful
,
and
the
whole
company
,
exhilarated
by
the
exercise
,
and
by
animated
conversation
,
were
in
high
spirits
;
and
perhaps
amongst
the
huge
party
,
which
numbered
nearly
three
hundred
persons
,
one
alone
was
a
prey
to
despair
.
<EOS>
But
though
Richard
Assheton
suffered
thus
internally
,
he
bore
his
anguish
with
Spartan
firmness
,
resolved
,
if
possible
,
to
let
no
trace
of
it
be
visible
in
his
features
or
deportment
;
and
he
so
far
succeeded
in
conquering
himself
,
that
the
King
,
who
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
him
,
remarked
to
Sir
John
Finett
as
they
rode
along
,
that
a
singular
improvement
had
taken
place
in
the
young
man
's
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
was
rapidly
approaching
the
glade
at
the
lower
end
of
the
chase
,
when
the
lively
notes
of
a
horn
were
heard
from
the
adjoining
wood
,
followed
by
the
deep
baying
of
a
bloodhound
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
<EOS>
they
have
roused
him
,
"
cried
the
King
,
joyfully
placing
his
own
bugle
to
his
lips
,
and
sounding
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
whole
company
halted
in
anxious
expectation
,
the
hounds
baying
loudly
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
a
noble
hart
burst
from
the
wood
,
whence
he
had
been
driven
by
the
shouts
of
Nicholas
and
the
chief
huntsman
,
both
of
whom
appeared
immediately
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
my
faith
!
<EOS>
a
great
hart
as
ever
was
hunted
,
"
exclaimed
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
There
boys
,
there
!
<EOS>
to
him
!
<EOS>
to
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
Dashing
after
the
flying
hart
,
the
hounds
made
the
welkin
ring
with
their
cries
.
<EOS>
Many
lovely
damsels
were
there
,
but
none
thought
of
the
cruelty
of
the
sport
--
none
sympathised
with
the
noble
animal
they
were
running
to
death
.
<EOS>
The
cries
of
the
hounds
--
now
loud
and
ringing
--
now
deep
and
doling
,
accompanied
by
the
whooping
of
the
huntsmen
,
formed
a
stirring
concert
,
which
found
a
response
in
many
a
gentle
bosom
.
<EOS>
The
whole
cavalcade
was
spread
widely
about
,
for
none
were
allowed
to
ride
near
the
King
.
<EOS>
Over
the
plain
they
scoured
,
fleet
as
the
wind
,
and
the
hart
seemed
making
for
a
fell
,
forming
part
of
the
hill
near
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
But
ere
he
reached
it
,
the
relays
stationed
within
a
covert
burst
forth
,
and
,
turning
him
aside
,
he
once
more
dashed
fleetly
across
the
broad
expanse
,
as
if
about
to
return
to
his
old
lair
.
<EOS>
Now
he
was
seen
plunging
into
some
bosky
dell
;
and
,
after
being
lost
to
view
for
a
moment
,
bounding
up
the
opposite
bank
,
and
stretching
across
a
tract
thickly
covered
with
fern
.
<EOS>
Here
he
gained
upon
the
hounds
,
who
were
lost
in
the
green
wilderness
,
and
their
cries
were
hushed
for
a
brief
space
--
but
anon
they
burst
forth
anew
,
and
the
pack
were
soon
again
in
full
cry
,
and
speeding
over
the
open
ground
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
the
cavalcade
had
kept
pretty
well
together
,
but
on
the
return
the
case
was
very
different
;
and
many
of
the
dames
,
being
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
hounds
,
fell
off
,
and
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
many
of
the
gallants
lingered
behind
,
too
.
<EOS>
Thus
only
the
keenest
huntsmen
held
on
.
<EOS>
Amongst
these
,
and
about
fifty
yards
behind
the
King
,
were
Richard
and
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
The
squire
was
right
when
he
predicted
that
the
hart
would
show
them
good
sport
.
<EOS>
Plunging
into
the
wood
,
the
hard
-
pressed
beast
knocked
up
another
stag
,
and
took
possession
of
his
lair
,
but
was
speedily
roused
again
by
Nicholas
and
the
chief
huntsman
.
<EOS>
Once
more
he
is
crossing
the
wide
plain
,
with
hounds
and
huntsmen
after
him
--
once
more
he
is
turned
by
a
new
relay
;
but
this
time
he
shapes
his
course
towards
the
woods
skirting
the
Darwen
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
piteous
sight
to
see
him
now
;
his
coat
black
and
glistening
with
sweat
,
his
mouth
embossed
with
foam
,
<EOS>
his
eyes
dull
,
big
tears
coursing
down
his
cheeks
,
and
his
noble
head
carried
low
.
<EOS>
His
end
seems
nigh
--
for
the
hounds
,
though
weary
too
,
redouble
their
energies
,
and
the
monarch
cheers
them
on
.
<EOS>
Again
the
poor
beast
erects
his
head
--
if
he
can
only
reach
yon
coppice
he
is
safe
.
<EOS>
Despair
nerves
him
,
and
with
gigantic
bounds
he
clears
the
intervening
space
,
and
disappears
beneath
the
branches
.
<EOS>
Quickly
as
the
hounds
come
after
him
,
they
are
at
fault
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
taken
to
the
soil
,
sire
,
"
cried
Nicholas
coming
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
the
river
--
to
the
river
!
<EOS>
You
may
see
by
the
broken
branches
he
has
gone
this
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
Forcing
his
way
through
the
wood
,
James
was
soon
on
the
banks
of
the
Darwen
,
which
here
ran
deep
and
slow
.
<EOS>
The
hart
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
,
nor
was
there
any
slot
on
the
further
side
to
denote
that
he
had
gone
forth
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
therefore
,
that
he
had
swam
down
the
stream
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
shout
was
heard
a
hundred
yards
lower
down
,
proceeding
from
Nicholas
;
and
,
riding
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
the
King
found
the
hart
at
bay
on
the
further
side
of
the
stream
,
and
nearly
up
to
his
haunches
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
The
King
regarded
him
for
a
moment
anxiously
.
<EOS>
The
poor
animal
was
now
in
his
last
extremity
,
but
he
seemed
determined
to
sell
his
life
dearly
.
<EOS>
He
stood
on
a
bank
projecting
into
the
stream
,
round
which
the
water
flowed
deeply
,
and
could
not
be
approached
without
difficulty
and
danger
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
gored
several
hounds
,
whose
bleeding
bodies
were
swept
down
the
current
;
and
,
though
the
others
bayed
round
him
,
they
did
not
dare
to
approach
him
,
and
could
not
get
behind
him
,
as
a
high
bank
arose
in
his
rear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
your
Majesty
's
permission
to
despatch
him
?
"
asked
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
marry
,
if
you
can
,
sir
,
"
replied
James
.
<EOS>
"
But
'
ware
the
tynes!--'ware
the
tynes!--'If
thou
be
hurt
with
hart
it
brings
thee
to
thy
bier
,
'
as
the
auld
ballad
hath
it
,
and
the
adage
is
true
,
as
we
oursel
's
have
seen
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
however
,
heeded
not
the
caution
,
but
,
drawing
his
wood
-
knife
,
and
disencumbering
himself
of
his
cloak
,
he
plunged
into
the
stream
,
and
with
one
or
two
strokes
reached
the
bank
.
<EOS>
The
hart
watched
his
approach
,
as
if
divining
his
purpose
,
with
a
look
half
menacing
,
half
reproachful
,
and
when
he
came
near
,
dashed
his
antlered
head
at
him
.
<EOS>
Nimbly
eluding
the
blow
,
which
,
if
it
had
taken
effect
,
might
have
proved
serious
,
Nicholas
plunged
his
weapon
into
the
poor
brute
's
throat
,
who
instantly
fell
with
a
heavy
splash
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
stricken
!
<EOS>
weel
stricken
!
"
shouted
James
,
who
had
witnessed
the
performance
from
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
"
But
how
shall
we
get
the
carcase
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
easily
done
,
sire
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
And
taking
hold
of
the
horns
,
he
guided
the
body
to
a
low
bank
,
a
little
below
where
the
King
stood
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
it
was
dragged
ashore
by
the
prickers
,
James
put
his
bugle
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
mort
.
<EOS>
A
pryse
was
thrice
sounded
by
Nicholas
,
and
soon
afterwards
the
whole
company
came
flocking
round
the
spot
,
whooping
the
death
-
note
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
hounds
had
gathered
round
the
fallen
hart
,
and
were
allowed
to
wreak
their
fury
on
him
by
tearing
his
throat
,
happily
after
sensibility
was
gone
;
while
Nicholas
,
again
baring
his
knife
,
cut
off
the
right
fore
-
foot
,
and
presented
it
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
While
this
ceremony
was
performed
,
the
varlets
of
the
kennel
having
cut
down
a
great
heap
of
green
branches
,
and
strewn
them
on
the
ground
,
laid
the
hart
upon
them
,
on
his
back
,
and
then
bore
him
to
an
open
space
in
the
wood
,
where
he
was
broken
up
by
the
King
,
who
prided
himself
upon
his
skill
in
all
matters
of
woodcraft
.
<EOS>
While
this
office
was
in
course
of
execution
a
bowl
of
wine
was
poured
out
for
the
monarch
,
which
he
took
,
adverting
,
as
he
did
so
,
to
the
common
superstition
,
that
if
a
huntsman
should
break
up
a
deer
without
drinking
,
the
venison
would
putrefy
.
<EOS>
Having
drained
the
cup
,
he
caused
it
to
be
filled
again
,
and
gave
it
to
Nicholas
,
saying
the
liquor
was
needful
to
him
after
the
drenching
he
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
James
then
proceeded
with
his
task
,
and
just
before
he
completed
it
,
he
was
reminded
,
by
a
loud
croak
above
him
,
that
a
raven
was
at
hand
,
and
accordingly
taking
a
piece
of
gristle
from
the
spoon
of
the
brisket
,
he
cast
it
on
the
ground
,
and
the
bird
immediately
pounced
down
upon
it
and
carried
it
off
in
his
huge
beak
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
brief
interval
,
the
seek
was
again
winded
,
another
hart
was
roused
,
and
after
a
short
but
swift
chase
,
pulled
down
by
the
hounds
,
and
dispatched
with
his
own
hand
by
James
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
then
besought
the
King
to
follow
him
,
and
led
the
way
to
a
verdant
hollow
surrounded
by
trees
,
in
which
shady
and
delicious
retreat
preparations
had
been
made
for
a
slight
silvan
repast
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
mossy
bank
beneath
a
tree
,
a
cushion
was
placed
for
the
King
,
and
before
it
on
the
sward
was
laid
a
cloth
spread
with
many
dainties
,
including
           
"
Neats
'
tongues
powder'd
<EOS>
well
,
and
jambons
of
the
hog
,
           
With
sausages
and
savoury
knacks
to
set
men
's
minds
agog"--
 
cold
capons
,
and
pigeon
pies
.
<EOS>
Close
at
hand
was
a
clear
cold
spring
,
in
which
numerous
flasks
of
wine
were
immersed
.
<EOS>
A
few
embers
,
too
,
had
been
lighted
,
on
which
carbonadoes
of
venison
were
prepared
.
 
<EOS>
No
great
form
or
ceremony
was
observed
at
the
entertainment
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Finett
and
Sir
Thomas
Hoghton
were
in
close
attendance
upon
the
monarch
,
and
ministered
to
his
wants
;
but
several
of
the
nobles
and
gentlemen
stretched
themselves
on
the
sward
,
and
addressed
themselves
to
the
viands
set
before
them
by
the
pages
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
dames
dismounted
,
and
few
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
any
refreshment
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
flasks
of
wine
,
there
were
two
barrels
of
ale
in
a
small
cart
,
drawn
by
a
mule
,
both
of
which
were
broached
.
<EOS>
The
whole
scene
was
picturesque
and
pleasing
,
and
well
calculated
to
gratify
one
so
fond
of
silvan
sports
as
the
monarch
for
whom
it
was
provided
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
tranquillity
and
enjoyment
an
incident
occurred
which
interrupted
it
as
completely
as
if
a
thunder
-
storm
had
suddenly
come
on
.
<EOS>
Just
when
the
mirth
was
at
the
highest
,
and
when
the
flowing
cup
was
at
many
a
lip
,
a
tremendous
bellowing
,
followed
by
the
crashing
of
branches
,
was
heard
in
the
adjoining
thicket
.
<EOS>
All
started
to
their
feet
at
the
appalling
sound
,
and
the
King
himself
turned
pale
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
in
Heaven
's
name
can
it
be
,
Sir
Richard
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
drove
of
wild
cattle
,
"
replied
the
baronet
,
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wild
cattle
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
James
,
in
great
alarm
;
"
and
sae
near
us
.
<EOS>
Zounds
!
<EOS>
we
shall
be
trampled
and
gored
to
death
by
these
bulls
of
Basan
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
,
ye
are
a
fause
traitor
thus
to
endanger
the
safety
o
'
your
sovereign
,
and
ye
shall
answer
for
it
,
if
harm
come
o
'
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
unable
to
account
for
it
,
sire
,
"
stammered
the
frightened
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
I
gave
special
directions
to
the
prickers
to
drive
the
beasts
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ye
shouldna
keep
sic
deevils
i
'
your
park
,
man
,
"
cried
the
monarch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
what
's
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
Amidst
all
this
consternation
and
confusion
the
bellowing
was
redoubled
,
and
the
crashing
of
branches
drew
nearer
and
nearer
,
and
Nicholas
Assheton
rushed
forward
with
the
King
's
horse
,
saying
,
"
Mount
,
sire
;
mount
,
and
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
James
was
so
much
alarmed
that
his
limbs
refused
to
perform
their
office
,
and
he
was
unable
to
put
foot
in
the
stirrup
.
<EOS>
Seeing
his
condition
,
Nicholas
cried
out
,
"
Pardon
,
my
liege
;
but
at
a
moment
of
peril
like
the
present
,
one
must
not
stand
on
ceremony
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
took
the
King
round
the
waist
,
and
placed
him
on
his
steed
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
a
loud
cry
was
heard
,
and
a
man
in
extremity
of
terror
issued
from
the
wood
,
and
dashed
towards
the
hollow
.
<EOS>
Close
on
his
heels
came
the
drove
of
wild
cattle
,
and
,
just
as
he
gained
the
very
verge
of
the
descent
,
the
foremost
of
the
herd
overtook
him
,
and
lowering
his
curled
head
,
caught
him
on
the
points
of
his
horns
,
and
threw
him
forwards
to
such
a
distance
that
he
alighted
with
a
heavy
crash
almost
at
the
King
's
feet
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
,
apparently
,
with
their
vengeance
,
or
alarmed
by
the
numerous
assemblage
,
the
drove
instantly
turned
tail
and
were
pursued
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
by
the
prickers
.
 
<EOS>
Having
recovered
his
composure
,
James
bade
some
of
the
attendants
raise
the
poor
wretch
,
who
was
lying
groaning
upon
the
ground
,
evidently
so
much
injured
as
to
be
unable
to
move
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
His
garb
was
that
of
a
forester
,
and
his
bulk
--
for
he
was
stoutly
and
squarely
built
--
had
contributed
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
severity
of
the
fall
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
lifted
from
the
ground
,
Nicholas
instantly
recognised
in
his
blackened
and
distorted
features
those
of
Christopher
Demdike
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
rushing
towards
him
.
"
<EOS>
Is
it
thou
,
villain
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
sufferer
only
replied
by
a
look
of
intense
malignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
what
--
d'ye
ken
wha
it
is
?
"
demanded
James
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
my
saul
!
<EOS>
I
fear
the
puir
fellow
has
maist
of
his
banes
broken
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
great
matter
if
they
be
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
and
it
may
save
the
application
of
torture
in
case
your
Majesty
desires
to
put
any
question
to
him
.
<EOS>
Chance
has
most
strangely
thrown
into
your
hands
one
of
the
most
heinous
offenders
in
the
kingdom
,
who
has
long
escaped
justice
,
but
who
will
at
length
meet
the
punishment
of
his
crimes
.
<EOS>
The
villain
is
Christopher
Demdike
,
son
of
the
foul
hag
who
perished
in
the
flames
on
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
,
and
captain
of
a
band
of
robbers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
is
the
knave
a
warlock
and
a
riever
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
James
,
regarding
Demdike
with
abhorrence
,
mingled
with
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Both
,
sire
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
"
and
an
assassin
to
boot
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
diabolical
villain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
be
taken
to
Hoghton
Tower
,
and
kept
in
some
strong
and
secure
place
till
we
have
leisure
to
examine
him
,
"
said
<EOS>
James,--"and
see
that
he
be
visited
by
some
skilful
chirurgeon
,
for
we
wadna
<EOS>
hae
him
dee
,
and
sae
rob
the
woodie
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Demdike
,
who
appeared
to
be
in
great
agony
,
now
forced
himself
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
make
important
disclosures
to
your
Majesty
,
"
he
said
,
in
hoarse
and
broken
tones
,
"
if
you
will
hear
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
only
offender
who
has
escaped
from
justice
,
"
he
added
,
glancing
vindictively
at
Nicholas--"there
is
another
,
a
notorious
witch
and
murderess
,
who
is
still
screened
from
justice
.
<EOS>
I
can
reveal
her
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Majesty
will
not
give
heed
to
such
a
villain
's
fabrications
?
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
they
fabrications
,
sir
?
"
rejoined
James
,
somewhat
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
We
maun
hear
and
judge
.
<EOS>
The
snake
,
though
scotched
,
will
still
bite
,
it
seems
.
<EOS>
We
hae
hangit
a
Highland
cateran
without
trial
afore
this
,
and
we
may
be
tempted
to
tak
the
law
into
our
ain
hands
again
.
<EOS>
Bear
the
villain
hence
.
<EOS>
See
he
be
disposed
of
as
already
directed
,
and
take
good
care
he
is
strictly
guarded
.
<EOS>
And
now
gie
us
a
crossbow
,
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
and
bid
the
prickers
drive
the
deer
afore
us
,
for
we
wad
try
our
skill
as
a
marksman
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
while
Demdike
was
placed
on
the
litter
of
green
boughs
which
had
recently
sustained
a
nobler
burthen
in
the
fallen
hart
,
and
in
this
sort
was
conveyed
to
Hoghton
Tower
,
James
rode
with
his
retinue
towards
a
long
glade
,
where
,
receiving
a
crossbow
from
the
huntsman
,
he
took
up
a
favourable
position
behind
a
large
oak
,
and
several
herds
of
deer
being
driven
before
him
,
he
selected
his
quarries
,
and
deliberately
took
aim
at
them
,
contriving
in
the
course
of
an
hour
to
bring
down
four
fat
bucks
,
and
to
maim
as
many
others
,
which
were
pulled
down
by
the
hounds
.
<EOS>
And
with
this
slaughter
he
was
content
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
then
informed
his
Majesty
that
a
huge
boar
,
which
,
in
sporting
phrase
,
had
left
the
sounder
five
years
,
had
broken
into
the
park
the
night
before
,
and
had
been
routing
amongst
the
fern
.
<EOS>
The
age
and
size
of
the
animal
were
known
by
the
print
of
the
feet
,
the
toes
being
round
and
thick
,
the
edge
of
the
hoof
worn
and
blunt
,
the
heel
large
,
and
the
guards
,
or
dew
-
claws
,
great
and
open
,
from
all
which
appearances
it
was
adjudged
by
the
baronet
to
be
"
a
great
old
boar
,
not
to
be
refused
.
"
 
<EOS>
James
at
once
agreed
to
hunt
him
,
and
the
hounds
being
taken
away
,
six
couples
of
magnificent
mastiffs
,
of
the
Lancashire
breed
,
were
brought
forward
,
and
the
monarch
,
under
the
guidance
of
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
and
the
chief
huntsman
,
repaired
to
an
adjoining
thicket
,
in
which
the
boar
fed
and
couched
.
 
<EOS>
On
arriving
near
his
den
,
a
boar
-
spear
was
given
to
the
King
,
and
the
prickers
advancing
into
the
wood
,
presently
afterwards
reared
the
enormous
brute
.
<EOS>
Sallying
forth
,
and
freaming
furiously
,
he
was
instantly
assailed
by
the
mastiffs
;
but
,
notwithstanding
the
number
of
his
assailants
,
he
made
light
of
them
,
shaking
them
from
his
bristly
hide
,
crushing
them
beneath
his
horny
feet
,
thrusting
at
them
with
his
sharpened
tusks
,
and
committing
terrible
devastation
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
Repeated
charges
were
made
upon
the
savage
animal
by
James
,
but
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
get
a
blow
at
him
for
some
time
;
and
when
at
length
the
monarch
made
the
attempt
,
he
struck
too
low
,
and
hit
him
on
the
snout
,
upon
which
the
infuriated
boar
,
finding
himself
wounded
,
sprang
towards
the
horse
,
and
ripped
him
open
with
his
tusks
.
 
<EOS>
The
noble
charger
instantly
rolled
over
on
his
side
,
exposing
the
royal
huntsman
to
the
fury
of
his
merciless
assailant
,
whose
tusks
must
have
ploughed
his
flesh
,
if
at
this
moment
a
young
man
had
not
ridden
forward
,
and
at
the
greatest
personal
risk
approached
the
boar
,
and
,
striking
straight
downwards
,
cleft
the
heart
of
the
fierce
brute
with
his
spear
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
King
,
having
been
disengaged
by
the
prickers
from
his
wounded
steed
,
which
was
instantly
put
out
of
its
agony
by
the
sword
of
the
chief
huntsman
,
looked
for
his
deliverer
,
and
,
discovering
him
to
be
Richard
Assheton
,
was
loud
in
his
expressions
of
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
"
Faith
!
<EOS>
ye
maun
claim
a
boon
at
our
hands
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"
It
maun
never
be
said
the
King
is
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
What
can
we
do
for
you
,
lad
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
myself
nothing
,
sire
,
"
replied
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
for
another
meikle
--
is
that
what
ye
wad
<EOS>
hae
us
infer
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
King
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Aweel
,
the
lassie
shall
hae
strict
justice
done
her
;
but
for
your
ain
sake
we
maun
inquire
into
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
wear
this
,
"
he
added
,
taking
a
magnificent
sapphire
ring
from
his
finger
,
"
and
,
if
you
should
ever
need
our
aid
,
send
it
to
us
as
a
token
.
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
took
the
gift
,
and
knelt
to
kiss
the
hand
so
graciously
extended
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
another
horse
had
been
provided
for
the
monarch
,
and
the
enormous
boar
,
with
his
feet
upwards
and
tied
together
,
was
suspended
upon
a
pole
,
and
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
four
stout
varlets
as
the
grand
trophy
of
the
chase
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
royal
company
issued
from
the
wood
a
strike
of
nine
was
blown
by
the
chief
huntsman
,
and
such
of
the
cavalcade
as
still
remained
on
the
field
being
collected
together
,
the
party
crossed
the
chase
,
and
took
the
direction
of
Hoghton
Tower
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IX.--THE
BANQUET
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
King
's
return
to
Hoghton
Tower
,
orders
were
given
by
Sir
Richard
for
the
immediate
service
of
the
banquet
;
it
being
the
hospitable
baronet
's
desire
that
festivities
should
succeed
each
other
so
rapidly
as
to
allow
of
no
tedium
.
 
<EOS>
The
_
coup
-
d'oeil
_
of
the
banquet
hall
on
the
monarch
's
entrance
was
magnificent
.
<EOS>
Panelled
with
black
lustrous
oak
,
and
lighted
by
mullion
windows
,
filled
with
stained
glass
and
emblazoned
with
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
family
,
the
vast
and
lofty
hall
was
hung
with
banners
,
and
decorated
with
panoplies
and
trophies
of
the
chase
.
<EOS>
Three
long
tables
ran
down
it
,
each
containing
a
hundred
covers
.
<EOS>
At
the
lower
end
were
stationed
the
heralds
,
the
pursuivants
,
and
a
band
of
yeomen
of
the
guard
,
with
the
royal
badge
,
a
demi
-
rose
crowned
,
impaled
with
a
demi
-
thistle
,
woven
in
gold
on
their
doublets
,
and
having
fringed
pole
-
axes
over
their
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
was
a
richly
carved
oak
screen
,
concealing
the
passages
leading
to
the
buttery
and
kitchens
,
in
which
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
,
the
pantlers
,
and
the
yeomen
of
the
cellar
and
ewery
,
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
Above
the
screen
was
a
gallery
,
occupied
by
the
trumpeters
and
minstrels
;
and
over
all
was
a
noble
rafter
roof
.
<EOS>
The
tables
were
profusely
spread
,
and
glittered
with
silver
dishes
of
extraordinary
size
and
splendour
,
as
well
as
with
flagons
and
goblets
of
the
same
material
,
and
rare
design
.
<EOS>
The
guests
,
all
of
whom
were
assembled
,
were
outnumbered
by
the
prodigious
array
of
serving
-
men
,
pages
,
and
yeomen
waiters
in
the
yellow
and
red
liveries
of
the
Stuart
.
 
<EOS>
Flourishes
of
trumpets
announced
the
coming
of
the
monarch
,
who
was
preceded
by
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
bearing
a
white
wand
,
and
ushered
with
much
ceremony
to
his
place
.
<EOS>
At
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
was
a
raised
floor
,
and
on
either
side
of
it
<EOS>
an
oriel
window
,
glowing
with
painted
glass
.
<EOS>
On
this
dais
the
King
's
table
was
placed
,
underneath
a
canopy
of
state
,
embroidered
with
the
royal
arms
,
and
bearing
James
's
kindly
motto
,
"
_
Beati
Pacifici
_
.
<EOS>
"
Seats
were
reserved
at
it
for
the
Dukes
of
Buckingham
and
Richmond
,
the
Earls
of
Pembroke
and
Nottingham
,
the
Lords
Howard
of
Effingham
and
Grey
of
Groby
,
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
and
the
Bishop
of
Chester
.
<EOS>
These
constituted
the
favoured
guests
.
<EOS>
Grace
having
been
said
by
the
bishop
,
the
whole
company
took
their
seats
,
and
the
general
stillness
hitherto
prevailing
throughout
the
vast
hall
was
broken
instantaneously
by
the
clatter
of
trenchers
.
 
<EOS>
A
famous
feast
<EOS>
it
was
,
and
worthy
of
commemoration
.
<EOS>
Masters
Morris
and
Miller
,
the
two
cooks
who
contrived
it
,
as
well
as
the
labourers
for
the
ranges
,
for
the
pastries
,
for
the
boiled
meats
,
and
for
the
pullets
,
performed
their
respective
parts
to
admiration
.
<EOS>
The
result
was
all
that
could
be
desired
.
<EOS>
The
fare
was
solid
and
substantial
,
consisting
of
dishes
which
could
be
cut
and
come
to
again
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
roast
meats
were
chines
of
beef
,
haunches
of
venison
,
gigots
of
mutton
,
fatted
geese
,
capons
,
turkeys
,
and
sucking
pigs
;
amongst
the
boiled
,
pullets
,
lamb
,
and
veal
;
but
baked
meats
chiefly
abounded
,
and
amongst
them
were
to
be
found
red
-
deer
pasty
,
hare
-
pie
,
gammon
-
of

<EOS>
With
the
salads
,
which
were
nothing
more
than
what
would
,
now
-
a
-
days
be
termed
"
vegetables
,
"
were
mixed
all
kinds
of
soused
fish
,
arranged
according
to
the
sewer

directions--"the

<EOS>
"
This
was
the
first
course
merely
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
were
all
kinds
of
game
and
wild
-
fowl
,
roast
herons

in
a
dish
,
bitterns
,
cranes
,
bustards
,
curlews
,

<EOS>
Besides
these
there
were
lumbar
pies
,
marrow
pies
,
quince
pies
,
artichoke
pies
,
florentines
,
and
innumerable
other
good
things
.
<EOS>
Some
dishes
were
specially
reserved
for
the
King
's
table
,
as
a
baked
swan
,
a
roast
peacock
,
and
the
jowl
of
a
sturgeon
soused
.
<EOS>
These
and
a
piece
of
roast
beef
formed
the
principal
dishes
.
 
<EOS>
The
attendants
at
the
royal
table
comprised
such
gentlemen
as
wore
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
's
liveries
,
and
amongst
these
,
of
course
,
were
Nicholas
Assheton
and
Sherborne
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
former
,
the
King
immediately
inquired
about
his
deliverer
,
and
on
hearing
he
was
at
the
lower
tables
,
desired
he
might
be
sent
for
,
and
,
as
Richard
soon
afterwards
appeared
,
having
on
his
return
from
the
chase
changed
his
sombre
apparel
for
gayer
attire
,
James
smiled
graciously
upon
him
,
and
more
than
once
,
as
a
mark
of
especial
favour
,
took
the
wine
-
cup
from
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
did
ample
justice
to
the
good
things
before
him
,
and
especially
to
the
beef
,
which
he
found
so
excellent
,
that
the
carver
had
to
help
him
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
ventured
to
express
his
gratification
that
his
Majesty
found
the
meat
good--"Indeed
,
it
is
generally
admitted
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
our
Lancashire
beef
is
well
fed
,
and
well
flavoured
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
flavoured
!
"
exclaimed
James
,
as
he
swallowed
the
last
juicy
morsel
;
"
it
is
delicious
!
<EOS>
Finer
beef
nae
man
ever
put
teeth
into
,
an
I
only
wish
a
'
my
loving
subjects
had
as
gude
a
dinner
as
I
hae
this
day
eaten
.
<EOS>
What
joint
do
ye
ca
'
it
,
Sir
Richard
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
with
eyes
evidently
twinkling
with
a
premeditated
jest
.
"
<EOS>
This
dish
,
"
replied
the
host
,
somewhat
surprised
"
this
,
sire
,
is
a
loin
of
beef
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
loin
!
"
exclaimed
James
,
taking
the
carving
-
knife
from
the
sewer
,
who
stood
by
,
"
by
my
faith
that
is
not
title
honourable
enough
for
joint
sae
worthy
.
<EOS>
It
wants
a
dignity
,
and
it
shall
hae
it
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
,
"
he
added
,
touching
the
meat
with
the
flat
of
the
long
blade
,
as
if
placing
the
sword
on
the
back
of
a
knight
expectant
,
"
henceforth
,
it
shall
be
SIR
-
LOIN
,
an

ye
ca
'
it
sae

<EOS>
Give
me
a
cup
of
wine
,
Master
Richard
Assheton
.
"
 
<EOS>
All
the
nobles
at
the
table
laughed
loudly
at
the
monarch
's
jest
,
and
as
it
was
soon
past
down
to
those
at
the
lower
table
,
the
hall
resounded
with
laughter
,
in
which
page
and
attendant
of
every
degree
joined
,
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
good
-
natured
originator
of
the
merriment.[4

<EOS>
"
My
dear
dad
and
gossip
appears
in
unwonted
good
spirits
to

"
observed
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
.
 
<EOS>
"
An

replied
the
King
,
"

he
added
,
pointing
to
Richard

"
<EOS>
Ye

"
 
<EOS>
"
Your

have
only
to

"
replied
Buckingham
,
somewhat
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were

remarked
Archie
Armstrong
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
your
Majesty
made
any
further
inquiries
about
the
girl
suspected
of
witchcraft
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Buckingham
,
renewing
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whist
,
Steenie
,
whist
!
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Didna
ye
see
her
yoursel
'
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
in
a
low
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
recollect
ye
werena
at
the
chase
.
<EOS>
Aweel
<EOS>

I

conferred

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
Sooth
to
say
,
her
looks
and
manners
are
mightily
in
her

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
mean
to
dismiss
the
matter
without
further
investigation
?
<EOS>
"
observed
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
thought
your
Majesty
delighted
to
exercise
your
sagacity
in
detecting
the
illusions
practised
by
Satan
and
his
worshippers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
sae
we
do
,
"
replied
James
.
"
<EOS>
But
bend
your
bonnie
head
this
way
till
we
whisper
in
your
ear
.
<EOS>
We
hae
a
device
for
finding
it
a
'
out
,
which
canna
fail
;
and
when
you
ken
it
you
will
applaud
your

,
and
perfit
maistery
o

the

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
your
Majesty
would
make
me
acquainted
with
this
notable
scheme
,
"
replied
Buckingham
,
with
ill
-
concealed
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
I
might
make
it
more
certain
of
success
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Na
--
<EOS>
na
--
we
shanna
let
the
cat
out
of

just
yet

"
returned
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
We
mean
it
as
a
surprise
to
ye
a
'
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
whatever
be
the
result
,
it
is
certain
to
answer
the
effect
intended
,
"
observed
the
Duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gae
wa
'
!
<EOS>
ye
are
ever
sceptical
,
Steenie
--
ever
misdoubting
your
ain
dear
dad
and
gossip
,
"
rejoined
James
;
"
but
ye
shall
find
we
haena
earned
the
title
o
'
the
British
Solomon
for
naething
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
the
King
arose
,
and
was
ushered
to
his
apartments
by
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
with
the
same
ceremony
as
had
been
observed
on
his
entrance
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
all
the
nobles
;
and
Nicholas
and
the
others
,
being
released
from
their
duties
,
repaired
to
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
to
dine
.
<EOS>
The
revel
was
now
sufficiently
boisterous
;
for
,
as
the
dames
had
departed
at
the
same
time
as
the
monarch
,
all
restraint
was
cast
aside
.
<EOS>
The
wine
-
cup
flowed
freely
,
and
the
rafters
rang
with
laughter
.
<EOS>
Under
ordinary
circumstances
Richard
would
have
shrunk
from
such
a
scene
;
but
he
had
now
a
part
to
play
,
and
therefore
essayed
to
laugh
at
each
jest
,
and
to
appear
as
reckless
as
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
He
was
glad
,
however
,
when
the
signal
for
general
dispersion
was
given
;
for
though
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
was
unwilling
to
stint
his
guests
,
he
was
fearful
,
if
they
sat
too
long
over
their
wine
,
some
disturbances
might
ensue
;
and
indeed
,
when
the
revellers
came
forth
and
dispersed
within
the
base
court
,
their
flushed
cheeks
,
loud
voices
,
and
unsteady
gait
,
showed
that
their
potations
had
already
been
deep
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
quite
as
much
mirth
was
taking
place
out
of
doors
as
had
occurred
within
the
banqueting
-
hall
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
King
sat
down
to
dinner
,
according
to
promise
the
gates
were
thrown
open
,
and
the
crowd
outside
admitted
.
<EOS>
The
huge
roast
was
then
taken
down
,
carved
,
and
distributed
among
them
;
the
only
difficulty
experienced
being
in
regard
to
trenchers
,
and
various
and
extraordinary
were
the
contrivances
resorted
to
to
supply
the
deficiency
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
,
however
,
served
to
heighten
the
fun
,
and
,
as
several
casks
of
stout
ale
were
broached
at
the
same
time
,
universal
hilarity
prevailed
.
<EOS>
Still
,
in
the
midst
of
so
vast
a
concourse
,
many
component
parts
of
which
had
now
began
to
experience
the
effects
of
the
potent
liquor
,
some
little
manifestation
of
disorder
might
naturally
be
expected
;
but
all
such
was
speedily
quelled
by
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
,
and
other
officials
appointed
for
the
purpose
,
and
,
amidst
the
uproar
and
confusion
,
harmony
generally
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
While
elbowing
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
Nicholas
felt
his
sleeve
plucked
,
and
turning
,
perceived
Nance
Redferne
,
who
signed
him
to
follow
her
,
and
there
was
something
in
her
manner
that
left
him
no
alternative
but
compliance
.
<EOS>
Nance
passed
on
rapidly
,
and
entered
the
doorway
of
a
building
,
where
it
might
be
supposed
they
would
be
free
from
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
with
me
,
Nance
?
"
asked
the
squire
,
somewhat
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
beg
to
observe
that
I
can
not
be
troubled
further
on
your
account
,
and
am
greatly
afraid
aspersions
may
be
thrown
on
my
character
,
if
I
am
seen
talking
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
few
words
wi
'
<EOS>
me
winna
injure
your
character
,
squire
,
"
rejoined
Nance
,
<EOS>
"
an
it
's
on
your
account
an
naw
on
my
own
that
ey

brought
you

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
ejaculated
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eigh

promise
ye

onless
their

said
Nance
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
can
be
easily
done
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
cause
them
to
be
arrested
at
once

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nah

rejoined
Nance--"Yo

<EOS>
"
What

such
miscreants

replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Show
me
where
they
are

Nance
,
or
I
must
make
you
a

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nah

yo
winna
do
that

squire

"
she
replied
in
a
tone
of
good
-
humoured
defiance
.
"
<EOS>
Ye
winna
do
it
for
two
good
reasons
:
first
,
becose
yo'd
be
harming
a
freend
who
wants
to
sarve
yo
,
and
_
win
<EOS>
_
do

if

and
secondly
,
becose
if
yo

ey'd
deprive

an
motion

When

The

<EOS>
Ey
am

an

if

"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
commit
the
matter
entirely
to
you
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Apparently
,
it
can
not
be
in
better
hands
.
<EOS>
But
are
you
aware
that
Christopher
Demdike
is
a
prisoner
here
in
Hoghton
Tower
?
<EOS>
He
was
taken
this
morning
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
knoa
it
,
"
replied
Nance
;
"
an
ey
knoa
also
why
he
went
there
,
<EOS>
an
it
wur
my
intention

<EOS>
However

<EOS>
Boh

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
injunctions
shall
be
obeyed
implicitly

Nance
,
"
rejoined
,
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
perfect
reliance

<EOS>
But
when
shall
I
see
you
again
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That

she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
To

My

Boh

"
 
<EOS>
And
,
without
waiting
an
answer
,
she
rushed
out
of
the
doorway
,
and
,
mingling
with
the
crowd
,
was
instantly
lost
to
view
;
while
Nicholas
,
full
of
the
intelligence
he
had
received
,
betook
himself
slowly
to
his
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
they
gone
when
a
door
,
which
had
been
standing
ajar
,
near
them
,
was
opened
wide
,
and
disclosed
the
keen
visage
of
Master
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
pretty
plot
hatching
<EOS>
--
here
's
a
nice
discovery
I
have
made
!
"
<EOS>
soliloquised
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
whole
Demdike
family
,
with
the
exception
of
the
old
witch
herself
,
whom
I
saw
burnt
on
Pendle
Hill
,
are
at
Hoghton
Tower
.
<EOS>
This
shall
be
made
known
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
Nicholas
Assheton
arrested
at
once
,
and
the
woman
with
him
,
whom
I
recognise
as
Nance
Redferne
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
wonderful
stroke
,
and
will
raise
me
highly
in
his
Majesty
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
Yet
stay
!
<EOS>
Will
not
this
interfere
with
my
other
plans
with
Jennet
?
<EOS>
Let
me
reflect
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
cautiously
to
work
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
I
cause
Nicholas
to
be
arrested
,
Nance
will
escape
,
and
then
I
shall
have
no
clue
to
the
others
.
<EOS>
No
--
<EOS>
no
;
I
must
watch
Nicholas
closely
,
and
take
upon
myself
all
the
credit
of
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
through
Jennet
I
may
be
able
to
detect
their
disguises
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
will
keep
a
sharp
look
-
out
.
<EOS>
Affairs
are
now
drawing
to
a
close
,
and
I
have
only
,
like
a
wary
and
experienced
fowler
,
to
lay
my
nets
cleverly
to
catch
the
whole
covey
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
these
ruminations
,
he
likewise
went
forth
into
the
base
court
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
day
was
one
round
of
festivity
and
enjoyment
,
in
which
all
classes
participated
.
<EOS>
There
were
trials
of
skill
and
strength
,
running
,
wrestling
,
and
cudgeling
-
matches
,
with
an
infinite
variety
of
country
games
and
shows
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
five
o'clock
<EOS>
a
rush
-
cart
,
decked
with
flowers
and
ribbons
,
and
bestridden
by
men
bearing
garlands
,
was
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
central
building
of
the
tower
,
in
an
open
window
of
which
<EOS>
sat
James
--
a
well
-
pleased
spectator
of
the
different
pastimes
going
forward
;
and
several
lively
dances
were
executed
by
a
troop
of
male
and
female
morris
-
dancers
,
accompanied
by
a
tabor
and
pipe
.
<EOS>
But
though
this
show
was
sufficiently
attractive
,
it
lacked
the
spirit
of
that
performed
at
Whalley
;
while
the
character
of
Maid
Marian
,
which
then
found
so
charming
a
representative
in
Alizon
,
was
now
personated
by
a
man
--
and
if
Nicholas
Assheton
,
who
was
amongst
the
bystanders
,
was
not
deceived
,
that
man
was
Jem
Device
.
<EOS>
Enraged
by
this
discovery
,
the
squire
was
about
to
seize
the
ruffian
;
but
,
calling
to
mind
Nance
's
counsel
,
he
refrained
,
and
Jem
<EOS>
(
if
it
indeed
were
he
)
retired
with
a
largess
,
bestowed
by
the
royal
hand
as
a
reward
for
his
uncouth
gambols
.
 
<EOS>
The
rush
-
cart
and
morris
-
dancers
having
disappeared
,
another
drollery
was
exhibited
,
called
the
"
Fool
and
his
Five
Sons
,
"
the
names
of
the
hopeful
offspring
of
the
sapient
sire
being
<EOS>
Pickle
Herring
,
Blue
Hose
,
Pepper
Hose
,
Ginger
Hose
,
and
Jack
Allspice
.
<EOS>
The
humour
of
this
piece
,
though
not
particularly
refined
,
seemed
to
be
appreciated
by
the
audience
generally
,
as
well
as
by
the
monarch
,
who
laughed
heartily
at
its
coarse
buffoonery
.
 
<EOS>
Next
followed
"
The
Plough
and
Sword
Dance
;
"
the
principal
actors
being
a
number
of
grotesque
figures
armed
with
swords
,
some
of
whom
were
yoked
to
a
plough
,
on
which
sat
a
piper
,
playing
lustily
while
dragged
along
.
<EOS>
The
plough
was
guided
by
a
man
clothed
in
a
bear
-
skin
,
with
a
fur
cap
on
his
head
,
and
a
long
tail
,
like
that
of
a
lion
,
dangling
behind
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
hirsute
personage
,
who
was
intended
to
represent
the
wood
-
demon
,
Hobthurst
,
Nicholas
again
detected
Jem
Device
,
and
again
was
strongly
tempted
to
disobey
Nance
's
injunctions
,
and
denounce
him
--
the
rather
that
he
recognised
in
an
attendant
female
,
in
a
fantastic
dress
,
the
ruffian
's
mother
,
Elizabeth
;
but
he
once
more
desisted
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
mummers
arrived
in
front
of
the
King
,
the
dance
began
.
<EOS>
With
their
swords
held
upright
,
the
party
took
hands
and
wheeled
rapidly
round
the
plough
,
keeping
time
to
a
merry
measure
played
by
the
piper
,
who
still
maintained
his
seat
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
ring
was
enlarged
to
double
its
former
size
,
each
man
extending
his
sword
to
his
neighbour
,
who
took
hold
of
the
point
;
after
which
an
hexagonal
figure
was
formed
,
all
the
blades
being
brought
together
.
<EOS>
The
swords
were
then
quickly
withdrawn
,
flashing
like
sunbeams
,
and
a
four
square
figure
was
presented
,
the
dancers
vaulting
actively
over
each
other
's
heads
.
<EOS>
Other
variations
succeeded
,
not
necessary
to
be
specified
--
and
the
sport
concluded
by
a
general
clashing
of
swords
,
intended
to
represent
a
melee
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Nicholas
had
been
joined
by
Richard
Assheton
,
and
the
latter
was
not
long
in
detecting
the
two
Devices
through
their
disguises
.
<EOS>
On
making
this
discovery
he
mentioned
it
to
the
squire
,
and
was
surprised
to
find
him
already
aware
of
the
circumstance
,
and
not
less
astonished
when
he
was
advised
to
let
them
alone
;
the
squire
adding
he
was
unable
at
that
time
to
give
his
reasons
for
such
counsel
,
but
,
being
good
and
conclusive
<EOS>
,
Richard
would
be
satisfied
of
their
propriety
hereafter
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
,
however
,
thought
otherwise
,
and
,
notwithstanding
his
relative
's
attempts
to
dissuade
him
,
announced
his
intention
of
causing
the
parties
to
be
arrested
at
once
;
and
with
this
design
he
went
in
search
of
an
officer
of
the
guard
,
that
the
capture
might
be
effected
without
disturbance
.
<EOS>
But
the
throng
was
so
close
round
the
dancers
that
he
could
not
pierce
it
,
and
being
compelled
to
return
and
take
another
course
,
he
got
nearer
to
the
mazy
ring
,
and
was
unceremoniously
pushed
aside
by
the
mummers
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
both
his
arms
were
forcibly
grasped
,
and
a
deep
voice
on
the
right
whispered
in
his
ear--"Meddle
not
with
us
,
and
we
will
not
meddle
with
you
,
"
while
similar
counsel
was
given
him
in
other
equally
menacing
tones
,
though
in
a
different
key
,
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
Richard
would
have
shaken
off
his
assailants
,
and
seized
them
in
his
turn
,
but
power
to
do
so
was
wanting
to
him
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
he
was
deprived
of
speech
and
motion
;
but
while
thus
situated
he
felt
that
the
sapphire
ring
given
him
by
the
King
was
snatched
from
his
finger
by
the
first
speaker
,
whom
he
knew
to
be
Jem
Device
,
while
a
fearful
spell
was
muttered
over
him
by
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
occurred
at
the
time
when
the
rattling
of
the
swords
engaged
the
whole
attention
of
the
spectators
,
no
one
noticed
what
was
going
forward
except
Nicholas
,
and
,
before
he
could
get
up
to
the
young
man
,
the
two
miscreants
were
gone
,
nor
could
any
one
tell
what
had
become
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
the
wretches
done
you
a
mischief
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
squire
,
in
a
low
tone
,
of
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
stolen
the
King
's
ring
,
which
I
meant
to
use
in
Alizon
's
behalf
,
"
replied
the
young
man
,
who
by
this
time
had
recovered
his
speech
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
unlucky
,
indeed
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
can
defeat
any
ill
design
they
may
intend
,
by
acquainting
Sir
John
Finett
with
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
them
be
,
"
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
time
is
not
yet
come
.
<EOS>
"
The
squire
did
not
look
round
,
for
he
well
knew
that
<EOS>
the
caution
proceeded
from
Nance
Redferne
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
accordingly
,
he
observed
to
Richard--"Tarry
awhile
,
and
you
will
be
amply
avenged
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
this
assurance
the
young
man
was
fain
to
be
content
.
 
<EOS>
Just
then
a
trumpet
was
sounded
,
and
a
herald
stationed
on
the
summit
of
the
broad
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
great
hall
,
proclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
that
a
tilting
-
match
was
about
to
take
place
between
Archie
Armstrong
,
jester
to
his
most
gracious
Majesty
,
and
Davy
Droman
,
who
filled
the
same
honourable
office
to
his
Grace
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
and
that
a
pair
of
gilt
-
heel'd
chopines
would
be
the
reward
of
the
successful
combatant
.
<EOS>
This
announcement
was
received
with
cheers
,
and
preparations
were
instantly
made
for
the
mock
tourney
.
<EOS>
A
large
circle
being
formed
by
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
,
with
an
alley
leading
to
it
on
either
side
,
the
two
combatants
,
mounted
on
gaudy
-
caparisoned
hobby
-
horses
,
rode
into
the
ring
.
<EOS>
Both
were
armed
to
the
teeth
,
each
having
a
dish
-
cover
braced
around
him
in
lieu
of
a
breastplate
,
a
newly
-
scoured
brass
porringer
on
his
head
,
a
large
pewter
platter
instead
of
a
buckler
,
and
a
spit
with
a
bung
at
the
point
,
to
prevent
mischief
,
in
place
of
a
lance
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
's
jester
was
an
obese
little
fellow
,
and
his
appearance
in
this
warlike
gear
was
so
eminently
ridiculous
,
that
it
provoked
roars
of
laughter
,
while
Archie
was
scarcely
less
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
After
curveting
round
the
arena
in
imitation
of
knights
of
chivalry
,
and
performing
"
their
careers
,
their
prankers
,
their
false
trots
,
their
smooth
ambles
,
and
Canterbury
paces
,
"
the
two
champions
took
up
a
position
opposite
each
other
,
with
difficulty
,
as
it
seemed
,
reining
in
their
pawing
chargers
,
and
awaiting
the
signal
of
attack
to
be
given
by
Sir
John
Finett
,
the
judge
of
the
tournament
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
long
delayed
,
and
the
"
laissez
aller
"
being
pronounced
,
the
preux
chevaliers
started
forward
with
so
much
fury
,
and
so
little
discretion
,
that
meeting
half
-
way
with
a
tremendous
shock
,
and
butting
against
each
other
like
two
rams
,
both
were
thrown
violently
backwards
,
exhibiting
,
amid
the
shouts
of
the
spectators
,
their
heels
,
no
longer
hidden
by
the
trappings
of
their
steeds
,
kicking
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
Encumbered
as
they
were
,
some
little
time
elapsed
before
they
could
regain
their
feet
,
and
their
lances
having
been
removed
in
the
mean
time
,
by
order
of
Sir
John
Finett
,
as
being
weapons
of
too
dangerous
a
description
for
such
truculent
combatants
,
they
attacked
each
other
with
their
broad
lathen
daggers
,
dealing
sounding
blows
upon
helm
,
habergeon
,
and
shield
,
but
doing
little
personal
mischief
.
<EOS>
The
strife
raged
furiously
for
some
time
,
and
,
as
the
champions
appeared
pretty
well
matched
,
it
was
not
easy
to
say
how
it
would
terminate
,
when
chance
seemed
to
decide
in
favour
of
Davy
Droman
;
for
,
in
dealing
a
heavier
blow
than
usual
,
Archie
's
dagger
snapped
in
twain
,
leaving
him
at
the
mercy
of
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
On
this
the
doughty
Davy
,
crowing
lustily
like
chanticleer
,
called
upon
him
to
yield
;
but
Archie
was
so
wroth
at
his
misadventure
,
that
,
instead
of
complying
,
he
sprang
forward
,
and
with
the
hilt
of
his
broken
weapon
dealt
his
elated
opponent
a
severe
blow
on
the
side
of
the
head
,
not
only
knocking
off
the
porringer
,
but
stretching
him
on
the
ground
beside
it
.
<EOS>
The
punishment
he
had
received
was
enough
for
poor
Davy
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
attempt
to
rise
,
and
Archie
,
crowing
in
his
turn
,
trampling
upon
the
body
of
his
prostrate
foe
,
and
then
capering
joyously
round
it
,
was
declared
the
victor
,
and
received
the
gilt
chopines
from
the
judge
,
amidst
the
laughter
and
acclamations
of
the
beholders
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
the
public
sports
concluded
;
and
,
as
evening
was
drawing
on
apace
,
such
of
the
guests
as
were
not
invited
to
pass
the
night
within
the
Tower
,
took
their
departure
;
while
shortly
afterwards
,
supper
being
served
in
the
banqueting
-
hall
on
a
scale
of
profusion
and
magnificence
quite
equal
to
the
earlier
repast
,
<EOS>
the
King
and
the
whole
of
his
train
sat
down
to
it
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
X.--EVENING
ENTERTAINMENTS
.
  
<EOS>
Other
amusements
were
reserved
for
the
evening
.
<EOS>
While
revelry
was
again
held
in
the
great
hall
;
while
the
tables
groaned
,
for
the
third
time
since
morning
,
with
good
cheer
,
and
the
ruby
wine
,
which
seemed
to
gush
from
inexhaustible
fountains
,
mantled
in
the
silver
flagons
;
while
seneschal
,
sewer
,
and
pantler
,
with
the
yeomen
of
the
buttery
and
kitchen
,
were
again
actively
engaged
in
their
vocations
;
while
of
the
three
hundred
guests
more
than
half
,
as
if
insatiate
,
again
vied
with
each
other
in
prowess
with
the
trencher
and
the
goblet
;
while
in
the
words
of
old
Taylor
,
the
water
poet
,
but
who
was
no
water
-
drinker
--
and
who
thus
sang
of
the
hospitality
of
the
men
of
Manchester
,
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
--
they
had
           
<EOS>
"
Roast
,
boil'd
,
bak'd
,
too
,
too
much
,
white
,
claret
,
sack
.
           
<EOS>
Nothing
they
thought
too
heavy
or
too
hot
,
           
<EOS>
Can
follow'd
can
,
and
pot
succeeded
pot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
--during
this
time
preparations
were
making
for
fresh
entertainments
out
of
doors
.
 
<EOS>
The
gardens
at
Hoghton
Tower
,
though
necessarily
confined
in
space
,
owing
to
their
situation
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
,
were
beautifully
laid
out
,
and
commanded
from
their
balustred
terraces
magnificent
views
of
the
surrounding
country
.
<EOS>
Below
them
lay
the
well
-
wooded
park
,
skirted
by
the
silvery
Darwen
,
with
the
fair
village
of
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
immediately
beyond
it
,
the
proud
town
of
Preston
further
on
,
and
the
single
-
coned
Nese
Point
rising
majestically
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
The
principal
garden
constituted
a
square
,
and
was
divided
with
mathematical
precision
,
according
to
the
formal
taste
of
the
time
,
into
smaller
squares
,
with
a
broad
well
-
kept
gravel
walk
at
each
angle
.
<EOS>
These
plots
were
arranged
in
various
figures
and
devices
--
such
as
the
cinq
-
foil
,
the
flower
-
de
-
luce
,
the
trefoil
,
the
lozenge
,
the
fret
,
the
diamond
,
the
crossbow
,
and
the
oval
--
all
very
elaborate
and
intricate
in
design
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
knots
,
as
they
were
termed
,
there
were
labyrinths
,
and
clipped
yew
-
tree
walks
,
and
that
indispensable
requisite
to
a
garden
at
the
period
,
a
maze
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
was
a
grassy
eminence
,
surmounted
by
a
pavilion
,
in
front
of
which
spread
a
grass
-
plot
of
smoothest
turf
,
ordinarily
used
as
a
bowling
-
green
.
<EOS>
At
the
lower
end
of
this
a
temporary
stage
was
erected
,
for
the
masque
about
to
be
represented
before
the
King
.
<EOS>
Torches
were
kindled
,
and
numerous
lamps
burned
in
the
branches
of
the
adjoining
trees
;
but
they
were
scarcely
needed
,
for
the
moon
being
at
the
full
,
the
glorious
effulgence
shed
by
her
upon
the
scene
rendered
all
other
light
pale
and
ineffectual
.
 
<EOS>
After
supper
,
at
which
the
drinking
was
deeper
than
at
dinner
,
the
whole
of
the
revellers
repaired
to
the
garden
,
full
of
frolic
and
merriment
,
and
well
-
disposed
for
any
diversion
in
store
for
them
.
<EOS>
The
King
was
conducted
to
the
bowling
-
green
by
his
host
,
preceded
by
a
crowd
of
attendants
bearing
odoriferous
torches
;
but
the
royal
gait
being
somewhat
unsteady
,
the
aid
of
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
's
arm
was
required
to
keep
the
monarch
from
stumbling
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
bacchanalians
followed
,
and
,
elated
as
they
were
,
it
will
not
be
wondered
that
they
put
very
little
restraint
upon
themselves
,
but
shouted
,
sang
,
danced
,
and
indulged
in
all
kinds
of
licence
.
 
<EOS>
Opposite
the
stage
prepared
for
the
masquers
a
platform
had
been
reared
,
in
front
of
which
was
a
chair
for
the
King
,
with
seats
for
the
nobles
and
principal
guests
behind
it
.
<EOS>
The
sides
were
hung
with
curtains
of
crimson
velvet
fringed
with
gold
;
the
roof
decorated
like
a
canopy
;
so
that
it
had
a
very
magnificent
effect
.
<EOS>
James
lolled
back
in
his
chair
,
and
jested
loudly
and
rather
indecorously
with
the
various
personages
as
they
took
their
places
around
him
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
five
minutes
the
whole
of
the
green
was
filled
with
revellers
,
and
great
was
the
pushing
and
jostling
,
the
laughing
and
screaming
,
that
ensued
among
them
.
<EOS>
Silence
was
then
enjoined
by
Sir
John
Finett
,
who
had
stationed
himself
on
the
steps
of
the
stage
,
and
at
this
command
the
assemblage
became
comparatively
quiet
,
though
now
and
then
a
half
-
suppressed
titter
or
a
smothered
scream
would
break
out
.
<EOS>
Amid
this
silence
the
King
's
voice
could
be
distinctly
heard
,
and
his
coarse
jests
reached
the
ears
of
all
the
astonished
audience
,
provoking
many
a
severe
comment
from
the
elders
,
and
much
secret
laughter
from
the
juniors
.
 
<EOS>
The
masque
began
.
<EOS>
Two
tutelar
deities
appeared
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
a
band
of
foresters
clad
in
Lincoln
green
,
with
bows
at
their
backs
.
<EOS>
The
first
deity
wore
a
white
linen
tunic
,
with
flesh
-
coloured
hose
and
red
buskins
,
and
had
a
purple
taffeta
mantle
over
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
In
his
hand
he
held
a
palm
branch
,
and
a
garland
of
the
same
leaves
was
woven
round
his
brow
.
<EOS>
The
second
household
god
was
a
big
brawny
varlet
,
wild
and
shaggy
in
appearance
,
being
clothed
in
the
skins
of
beasts
,
with
sandals
of
untanned
cowhide
.
<EOS>
On
his
head
was
a
garland
of
oak
leaves
;
and
from
his
neck
hung
a
horn
.
<EOS>
He
was
armed
with
a
hunting
-
spear
and
wood
-
knife
,
and
attended
by
a
large
Lancashire
mastiff
.
<EOS>
Advancing
to
the
front
of
the
stage
,
the
foremost
personage
thus
addressed
the
Monarch--
           
<EOS>
"
This
day
--
great
King
for
government
admired
!
           
<EOS>
Which
these
thy
subjects
have
so
much
<EOS>
desired--
           
<EOS>
Shall
be
kept
holy
in
their
heart
's
best
treasure
,
           
And
vow'd
to
JAMES
as
is
this
month
to
Cæsar
.
           
<EOS>
And
now
the
landlord
of
this
ancient
Tower
,
           
<EOS>
Thrice
fortunate
to
see
this
happy
hour
,
           
<EOS>
Whose
trembling
heart
thy
presence
sets
on
fire
,
           
<EOS>
Unto
this
house
--
the
heart
of
all
our
shire--
           
Does
bid
thee
cordial
welcome
,
and
would
speak
it
           
In
higher
notes
,
but
extreme
joy
doth
break
it
.
           
<EOS>
He
makes
his
guests
most
welcome
,
in
his
eyes
           
<EOS>
Love
tears
do
sit
,
not
he
that
shouts
and
cries
.
           
<EOS>
And
we
the
antique
guardians
of
<EOS>
this
place,--
           
<EOS>
I
of
this
house
--
he
of
the
fruitful
chase,--
           
<EOS>
Since
the
bold
Hoghtons
from
this
hill
took
name
,
           
<EOS>
Who
with
the
stiff
,
unbridled
Saxons
came
,
           
And
so
have
flourish'd
<EOS>
in
this
fairer
clime
           
Successively
from
that
to
this
our
time
,
           
Still
offering
up
to
our
immortal
powers
           
Sweet
incense
,
wine
,
and
odoriferous
flowers
;
           
While
sacred
Vesta
,
in
her
virgin
tire
,
           
With
vows
and
wishes
tends
the
hallow'd
fire
.
           
<EOS>
Now
seeing
that
thy
Majesty
is
thus
           
Greater
than
household
deities
like
us
,
           
We
render
up
to
thy
more
powerful
guard
,
           
This
Tower
.
<EOS>
This
knight
is
thine
--
he
is
thy
ward
,
           
<EOS>
For
by
thy
helping
and
auspicious
hand
,
           
He
and
his
home
shall
ever
,
ever
stand
           
And
flourish
,
in
despite
of
envious
fate
;
           
And
then
live
,
like
Augustus
,
fortunate
.
           
<EOS>
And
long
,
long
mayst
thou
live!--To
which
both
men
           
And
guardian
angels
<EOS>
cry--"Amen
!
<EOS>
amen
!
"
 
<EOS>
James
,
who
had
demeaned
himself
critically
during
the
delivery
of
the
address
,
observed
at
its
close
to
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
who
was
standing
immediately
behind
his
chair
<EOS>
,
"
We
can
not
say
meikle
for
the
rhymes
,
which
are
but
indifferently
strung
together
,
but
the
sentiments
are
leal
and
gude
,
and
that
is
a
'
we
care
for
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
this
the
second
tutelar
divinity
advanced
,
and
throwing
himself
into
an
attitude
,
as
if
bewildered
by
the
august
presence
in
which
he
stood
,
exclaimed--
           
"
Thou
greatest
of
mortals!"--
 
And
then
stopped
,
as
if
utterly
confounded
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
,
and
then
roared
out--"Weel
,
gudeman
,
your
commencement
is
pertinent
and
true
enough
;
and
though
we
be
'
the
greatest
of
mortals
,
'
as
ye
style
us
,
dinna
fash
yoursel
'
about
our
grandeur
,
but
go
on
,
as
if
we
were
nae
better
nor
wiser
than
your
ain
simple
sel
'
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
instead
of
encouraging
the
dumbfounded
deity
,
this
speech
completely
upset
him
.
<EOS>
He
hastily
retreated
;
and
,
in
trying
to
screen
himself
behind
the
huntsman
,
fell
back
from
the
stage
,
and
his
hound
leapt
after
him
.
<EOS>
The
incident
,
whether
premeditated
or
not
,
amused
the
spectators
much
more
than
any
speech
he
could
have
delivered
,
and
the
King
joined
heartily
in
the
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
Silence
being
again
restored
,
the
first
divinity
came
forward
once
more
,
and
spoke
thus:--
           
'
Dread
lord
!
<EOS>
thy
Majesty
hath
stricken
dumb
           
<EOS>
His
weaker
god
-
head
;
if
to
himself
he
come
,
           
<EOS>
Unto
thy
service
straight
he
will
commend
           
<EOS>
These
foresters
,
and
charge
them
to
attend
           
Thy
pleasure
in
this
park
,
and
show
such
sport
;
           
To
the
chief
huntsman
and
thy
princely
court
,
           
<EOS>
As
the
small
circle
of
this
round
affords
,
           
And
be
more
ready
than
he
was
in
words
.
<EOS>
"[5
]
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
spoken
,
and
to
the
purpose
,
gude
fallow
,
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
And
we
take
this
opportunity
of
assuring
our
worthy
host
,
in
the
presence
of
his
other
guests
,
that
we
have
never
had
better
sport
in
park
or
forest
than
we
have
this
day
enjoyed
--
have
never
eaten
better
cheer
,
nor
quaffed
better
wine
than
at
his
board
--
and
,
altogether
,
have
never
been
more
hospitably
welcomed
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
was
overwhelmed
by
his
Majesty
's
commendation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
nothing
,
my
gracious
liege
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
merit
such
acknowledgment
on
your
part
,
and
the
delight
I
experience
is
only
tempered
by
my
utter
unworthiness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hoot
-
toot
!
<EOS>
man
,
"
replied
James
,
jocularly
,
"
ye
merit
a
vast
deal
mair
than
we
hae
said
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
gude
folk
dinna
always
get
their
deserts
.
<EOS>
Ye
ken
that
,
Sir
Richard
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
hae
ye
not
some
ither
drolleries
in
store
for
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
baronet
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
soon
afterwards
the
stage
was
occupied
by
a
new
class
of
performers
,
and
a
drollery
commenced
which
kept
the
audience
in
one
continual
roar
of
laughter
so
long
as
it
lasted
.
<EOS>
And
yet
none
of
the
parts
had
been
studied
,
the
actors
entirely
trusting
to
their
own
powers
of
comedy
to
carry
it
out
.
<EOS>
The
principal
character
was
the
Cap
Justice
,
enacted
by
Sir
John
Finett
,
who
took
occasion
in
the
course
of
the
performance
to
lampoon
and
satirise
most
of
the
eminent
legal
characters
of
the
day
,
mimicking
the
voices
and
manner
of
the
three
justices
--
Crooke
,
Hoghton
,
and
Doddridge
--
so
admirably
,
that
his
hearers
were
wellnigh
convulsed
;
and
the
three
learned
gentlemen
,
who
sat
near
the
King
,
though
fully
conscious
of
the
ridicule
applied
to
them
,
were
obliged
to
laugh
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
But
the
unsparing
satirist
was
not
content
with
this
,
but
went
on
,
with
most
of
the
other
attendants
upon
the
King
,
and
being
intimately
versed
in
court
scandal
,
he
directed
his
lash
with
telling
effect
.
<EOS>
As
a
contrast
to
the
malicious
pleasantry
of
the
Cap
Justice
,
were
the
gambols
and
jests
of
Robin
Goodfellow
--
a
merry
imp
,
who
,
if
he
led
people
into
mischief
,
was
always
ready
to
get
them
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
dance
by
Bill
Huckler
,
old
Crambo
,
and
Tom
o
<EOS>
'
Bedlam
,
the
half
-
crazed
individual
already
mentioned
as
being
among
the
crowd
in
the
base
court
.
<EOS>
This
was
applauded
to
the
echo
,
and
consequently
repeated
.
<EOS>
But
the
most
diverting
scene
of
all
was
that
in
which
Jem
Tospot
and
the
three
Doll
Wangos
appeared
.
<EOS>
Though
given
in
the
broadest
vernacular
of
the
county
,
and
scarcely
intelligible
to
the
whole
of
the
company
,
the
dialogue
of
this
part
of
the
piece
was
so
lifelike
and
natural
,
that
every
one
recognised
its
truth
;
while
the
situations
,
arranged
with
the
slightest
effort
,
and
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
were
extremely
ludicrous
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
supposed
to
take
place
in
a
small
Lancashire
alehouse
,
where
a
jovial
pedlar
was
carousing
,
and
where
,
being
visited
by
his
three
sweethearts
--
each
of
whom
he
privately
declared
to
be
the
favourite
--
he
had
to
reconcile
their
differences
,
and
keep
them
all
in
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
Familiar
with
the
character
in
all
its
aspects
,
Nicholas
played
it
to
the
life
;
and
,
to
do
them
justice
,
Dames
Baldwyn
,
Tetlow
,
and
Nance
Redferne
,
were
but
little
if
at
all
inferior
to
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
reality
in
their
jealous
quarrelling
that
gave
infinite
zest
to
the
performance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Saul
o
'
my
body
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
James
,
admiringly
,
"
those
are
three
braw
women
.
<EOS>
Ane
of
them
maun
be
sax
feet
if
she
is
an

and
weel

and
weel

<EOS>
Zounds
!
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
,
there
's
nae
standing
the
spells
<EOS>
o
'
your
Lancashire
Witches
.
<EOS>
High
-
born
and
low
-
born
,
they
are
a
'
alike
.
<EOS>
I
wad
their
only
witchcraft
lay
in
their
een
.
<EOS>
I
should
then
hae
the
less
fear
of
'em
.
<EOS>
But
have
you
aught
mair
?
<EOS>
for
it
is
growing
late
,
and
ye
ken
we
hae
something
to
do
in
that
pavilion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Only
a
merry
dance
,
my
liege
,
in
which
a
man
will
appear
in
a
dendrological
foliage
of
fronds
,
"
replied
the
baronet
.
 
<EOS>
James
laughed
at
the
description
,
and
soon
afterwards
a
party
of
mummers
,
male
and
female
,
clad
in
various
grotesque
garbs
,
appeared
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
them
was
the
"
dendrological
man
,
"
enclosed
in
a
framework
of
green
boughs
,
like
that
borne
by
a
modern
Jack
-
in
-
the
-
green
.
<EOS>
A
ring
was
formed
by
the
mummers
,
and
the
round
commenced
to
lively
music
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
mazy
measure
was
proceeding
,
Nance
Redferne
,
who
had
quitted
the
stage
with
Nicholas
,
and
now
stood
close
to
him
among
the
spectators
,
said
in
a
low
tone
,
"
Look
there
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
squire
glanced
in
the
direction
indicated
,
and
to
his
surprise
and
terror
,
distinguished
,
among
the
crowd
at
a
little
distance
,
the
figure
of
a
Cistertian
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
invisible
to
every
eye
except
our
own
,
"
whispered
Nance
,
"
and
is
come
to
tell
me
it
is
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Time
for
what
?
"
demanded
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Time
for
you
to
seize
those
two
accursed
Devices
,
Jem
and
his
mother
,
"
replied
Nance
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
both
on
yon
boards
.
<EOS>
Jem
is
the
man
in
the
tree
,
and
Elizabeth
is
the
owd
crone
in
the
red
kirtle
and
high

crowned
hat

<EOS>
Yo

The
monk
is
gone
,
"
cried
Nicholas
;
"
I
have
kept
my
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
him
,
and
he
has
melted
into
air
.
<EOS>
What
has
he
to
do
with
the
Devices
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
their
fate
,
"
returned
Nance
,
"
an
ey
<EOS>

'
acted
under
his
orders
.
<EOS>
Boh

,
an
seize
them
.
<EOS>
Ey

"
 
<EOS>
Forcing
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
Nicholas
ran
up
the
steps
,
and
,
followed
by
Nance
,
sprang
upon
the
stage
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
occasioned
considerable
surprise
;
but
as
he
was
recognised
by
the
spectators
as
the
jolly
Jem
Tospot
,
who
had
so
recently
diverted
them
,
and
his
companion
as
one
of
the
three
Doll
Wangos
,
in
anticipation
of
some
more
fun
they
received
him
with
a
round
of
applause
.
<EOS>
But
without
stopping
to
acknowledge
it
,
or
being
for
a
moment
diverted
from
his
purpose
,
Nicholas
seized
the
old
crone
,
and
,
consigning
her
to
Nance
,
caught
hold
of
the
leafy
frame
in
which
the
man
was
encased
,
and
pulled
him
from
under
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
began
to
think
he
had
unkennelled
the
wrong
fox
,
for
the
man
,
though
a
tall
fellow
,
bore
no
resemblance
to
Jem
Device
;
while
,
when
the
crone
's
mask
was
plucked
off
,
she
was
found
to
be
a
comely
young
woman
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
all
around
was
in
an
uproar
,
and
amidst
a
hurricane
of
hisses
,
yells
,
and
other
indications
of
displeasure
from
the
spectators
,
several
of
the
mummers
demanded
the
meaning
of
such
a
strange
and
unwarrantable
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
a
couple
of
witches
,
"
cried
Nicholas
;
"
this
is
Jem
Device
and
his
mother
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
nother
Jem
nor
Device
,
"
cried
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
mine
Elizabeth
,
"
screamed
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
the
Devices
,
"
cried
two
or
three
voices
,
"
and
these
are
none
of
'
em
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
was
perplexed
.
<EOS>
The
storm
increased
;
threats
accompanied
the
hisses
;
when
luckily
he
espied
a
ring
on
the
man
's
finger
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
seized
his
hand
,
and
held
it
up
to
the
general
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
proof!--a
proof
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
This
sapphire
ring
was
given
by
the
King
to
my
cousin
,
Richard
Assheton
,
this
morning
,
and
stolen
from
him
by
Jem
Device
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Examine
their
features
again
,
"
said
Nance
Redferne
,
waving
her
hands
over
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yo
win
<EOS>
aw
knoa
them
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
woman
's
face
instantly
altered
.
<EOS>
Many
years
being
added
to
it
in
a
breath
.
<EOS>
The
man
changed
equally
.
<EOS>
The
utmost
astonishment
was
evinced
by
all
at
the
transformation
,
and
the
bystanders
who
had
spoken
before
,
now
cried
out
loudly--"We
know
them
perfectly
now
.
<EOS>
They
are
the
two
Devices
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
an
officer
,
attended
by
a
party
of
halberdiers
,
had
mounted
the
boards
,
and
the
two
prisoners
were
delivered
to
their
custody
by
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
d
!
"
cried
the
man
;
"
Ey

no

<EOS>
Ey

This

<EOS>

"
 
<EOS>
And
as
Nance
was
secured
,
he
laughed
malignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
care
not
,
"
replied
Nance
.
<EOS>
"
Ey
am
now
revenged
on
you

.
"
 
<EOS>
While
this
impromptu
performance
took
place
,
as
much
to
the
surprise
of
James
as
of
any
one
else
,
and
while
he
was
desiring
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
to
ascertain
what
it
all
meant
--
at
the
very
moment
that
the
two
Devices
and
Nance
removed
from
the
stage
,
an
usher
approached
the
monarch
,
and
said
that
Master
Potts
entreated
a
moment
's
audience
of
his
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Potts
!
"
exclaimed
James
,
somewhat
confused
.
<EOS>
"
Wha
is
he?--ah
,
yes
!
<EOS>
I
recollect
--
a
witch
-
finder
.
<EOS>
Weel
,
let
him
approach
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
next
moment
the
little
attorney
,
whose
face
was
evidently
charged
with
some
tremendous
intelligence
,
was
ushered
into
the
king
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
profound
reverence
,
he
said
,
"
May
it
please
your
Majesty
,
I
have
something
for
your
private
ear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aweel
,
then
,
"
replied
James
,
"
approach
us
mair
closely
.
<EOS>
What
hae
ye
got
to
say
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Aught
mair
anent
these
witches
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
,
sire
,
"
said
Potts
,
in
an
impressive
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Something
dreadful
has
happened
--
something
terrible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
James
,
looking
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
is
it
,
man
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Murder
?
<EOS>
sire,--murder
has
been
done
,
"
said
Potts
,
in
low
thrilling
accents
.
 
<EOS>
"
Murder
!
"
exclaimed
James
,
horror
-
stricken
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tell
us
a
'
about
it
,
and
without
more
ado
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Potts
was
still
circumspect
.
<EOS>
With
an
air
of
deepest
mystery
,
he
approached
his
head
as
near
as
he
dared
to
that
of
the
monarch
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
this
be
true
?
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
If
sae
--
it
's
very
shocking
--
very
sad
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
true
,
as
your
Majesty
will
find
on
investigation
,
"
replied
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
little
girl
I
told
you
of
,
Jennet
Device
,
saw
it
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
,
weel
<EOS>
,
there
is
nae
accounting
for
human
frailty
and
wickedness
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"
Let
a
'
necessary
steps
be
taken
at
once
.
<EOS>
We
will
consider
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
--
d'ye
hear
,
sir?--dinna
let
the
bairn
Jennet
go
.
<EOS>
Haud
her
fast
.
<EOS>
D'ye
mind
that
?
<EOS>
Now
go
,
and
cause
the
guilty
party
to
be
put
under
arrest
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
on
receiving
this
command
Master
Potts
departed
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
was
he
gone
than
Nicholas
Assheton
came
up
to
the
railing
of
the
platform
,
and
,
imploring
his
Majesty
's
forgiveness
for
the
disturbance
he
had
occasioned
<EOS>
,
explained
that
it
had
been
owing
to
the
seizure
of
the
two
Devices
,
who
,
for
some
wicked
but
unexplained
purpose
,
had
contrived
to
introduce
themselves
,
under
various
disguises
,
into
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ye
did
right
to
arrest
the
miscreants
,
sir
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"
But
hae
ye
heard
what
has
happened
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Nicholas
,
alarmed
by
the
King
's
manner
;
"
what
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
nearer
,
and
ye
shall
learn
,
"
replied
James
;
"
for
we
wadna
hae
<EOS>
it
bruited
abroad
,
though
if
true
,
as
we
canna
doubt
,
it
will
be
known
soon
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
squire
bent
forward
,
he
imparted
some
intelligence
to
him
,
which
instantly
changed
the
expression
of
the
latter
to
one
of
mingled
horror
and
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
,
sire
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
her
innocence
with
my
life
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
Your
Majesty
's
patience
is
abused
.
<EOS>
It
is
Jennet
who
has
done
it
--
not
she
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
unravel
the
terrible
mystery
.
<EOS>
You
have
the
other
two
wretches
prisoners
,
and
can
enforce
the
truth
from
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
essay
to
do
so
,
"
replied
James
;
"
but
we
have
also
another
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Christopher
Demdike
?
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Christopher
Demdike
,
"
rejoined
James
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
another
besides
him
--
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
You
stare
,
sir
;
but
it
is
true
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
yonder
pavilion
.
<EOS>
We
ken
fu
'
weel
wha
assisted
her
flight
,
and
wha
concealed
her
.
<EOS>
Maister
Potts
has
told
us
a
'
.
<EOS>
It
is
weel
for
you
that
your
puir
kinsman
,
Richard
Assheton
,
did
us
sic
gude
service
at
the
boar
-
hunt
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
now
be
unmindful
of
it
,
even
though
he
can
not
send
us
the
ring
we
gave
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
here
,
sire
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
stolen
from
him
by
the
villain
,
Jem
Device
.
<EOS>
The
poor
youth
meant
to
use
it
for
Alizon
.
<EOS>
I
now
deliver
it
to
your
Majesty
as
coming
from
him
in
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
we
sae
receive
it
,
"
replied
the
monarch
,
brushing
away
the
moisture
that
gathered
thickly
in
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
tall
personage
,
wrapped
in
a
cloak
,
who
appeared
to
be
an
officer
of
the
guard
,
approached
the
railing
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
inform
your
Majesty
that
Christopher
Demdike
has
just
died
of
his
wounds
,
"
said
this
personage
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
sae
he
has
had
a
strae
death
,
after
a
'
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
James
.
<EOS>
"
Weel
,
we
are
sorry
for
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
portion
will
be
eternal
bale
,
"
observed
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
know
you
that
,
sir
?
"
demanded
the
King
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
his
judge
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
witnessed
his
end
,
sire
,
"
replied
the
officer
;
"
and
no
man
who
died
as
he
died
can
be
saved
.
<EOS>
The
Fiend
was
beside
him
at
the
death
-
throes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Save
us
!
"
exclaimed
James
.
"
<EOS>
Ye
dinna
say
so
?
<EOS>
God
's
santie
!
<EOS>
man
,
but
this
is
grewsome
,
and
gars
the
flesh
creep
on
one
's
banes
.
<EOS>
Let
his
foul
carcase
be
taen
awa

,
and
hangit
on
a
gibbet
on
the
hill
where
Malkin
Tower
aince
stood
,
as
a
warning
to
a
'
sic
heinous
offenders
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
King
ceased
speaking
,
Master
Potts
appeared
out
of
breath
,
and
greatly
excited
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
escaped
,
sire
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wha
!
Jennet
!
"
exclaimed
James
.
<EOS>
"
If
sae
,
we
will
tang
you
in
her
stead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sire
--
Alizon
,
"
replied
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
nowhere
find
her
;
nor--
"
and
he
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
--
weel
--
it
is
nae
great
matter
,
"
replied
James
,
as
if
relieved
,
and
with
a
glance
of
satisfaction
at
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
Alizon
is
,
sire
,
"
said
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
James
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
fellow
is
strangely
officious
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
And
where
may
she
be
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
produce
her
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
yonder
pavilion
,
"
replied
the
officer
,
"
and
all
that
Master
Potts
has
been
unable
to
find
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Majesty
may
trust
him
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
who
had
attentively
regarded
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
he
will
make
good
his
words
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
?
"
cried
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
Then
we
will
put
him
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
You
will
engage
to
confront
Alizon
with
her
mother
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
to
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
sire
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
require
the
assistance
of
a
dozen
men
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tak
twenty
,
if
you
will
,
"
replied
the
King,--"I
am
impatient
to
see
what
you
can
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
quarter
of
a
minute
all
shall
be
ready
within
the
pavilion
,
sire
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
one
masque
to
-
night;--but
you
shall
now
behold
a
different
one
--
the
masque
of
death
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
felt
sure
he
would
accomplish
his
task
,
for
he
had
recognised
in
him
the
Cistertian
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Sir
Richard
Assheton
of
Middleton
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
left
the
Tower
with
his
daughter
Dorothy
,
immediately
after
the
banquet
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
--
right
glad
,
"
replied
the
monarch
;
"
the
terrible
intelligence
can
be
the
better
broken
to
them
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
come
upon
them
suddenly
,
it
might
have
been
fatal
--
especially
to
the
puir
lassie
.
<EOS>
Let
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
of
Whalley
come
to
me
--
and
Master
Roger
Nowell
of
Read
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Majesty
shall
be
obeyed
,
"
replied
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
then
gave
some
instructions
respecting
the
prisoners
,
and
bade
Master
Potts
have
Jennet
in
readiness
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
to
see
what
terrible
thing
had
happened
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XI.--FATALITY
.
  
<EOS>
Along
the
eastern
terrace
a
youth
and
maiden
were
pacing
slowly
.
<EOS>
They
had
stolen
forth
unperceived
from
the
revel
,
and
,
passing
through
a
door
standing
invitingly
open
,
had
entered
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Though
overjoyed
in
each
other
's
presence
,
the
solemn
beauty
of
the
night
,
so
powerful
in
its
contrast
to
the
riotous
scene
they
had
just
quitted
,
profoundly
impressed
them
.
<EOS>
Above
,
were
the
deep
serene
heavens
,
lighted
up
by
the
starry
host
and
their
radiant
queen
--
below
,
the
immemorial
woods
,
steeped
in
silvery
mists
arising
from
the
stream
flowing
past
them
.
<EOS>
All
nature
was
hushed
in
holy
rest
.
<EOS>
In
opposition
to
the
flood
of
soft
light
emanating
from
the
lovely
planet
overhead
,
and
which
turned
all
it
fell
on
,
whether
tree
,
or
tower
,
or
stream
,
to
beauty
,
was
the
artificial
glare
caused
by
the
torches
near
the
pavilion
;
while
the
discordant
sounds
occasioned
by
the
minstrels
tuning
their
instruments
,
disturbed
the
repose
.
<EOS>
As
they
went
on
,
however
,
these
sounds
were
lost
in
the
distance
,
and
the
glare
of
the
torches
was
excluded
by
intervening
trees
.
<EOS>
Then
the
moon
looked
down
lovingly
upon
them
,
and
the
only
music
that
reached
their
ears
arose
from
the
nightingales
.
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
they
walked
on
again
,
hand
-
in
-
hand
,
gazing
at
each
other
,
at
the
glorious
heavens
,
and
drinking
in
the
thrilling
melody
of
the
songsters
of
the
grove
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
angle
of
the
terrace
was
a
small
arbour
placed
in
the
midst
of
a
bosquet
,
and
they
sat
down
within
it
.
<EOS>
Then
,
and
not
till
then
,
did
their
thoughts
find
vent
in
words
.
<EOS>
Forgetting
the
sorrows
they
had
endured
,
and
the
perils
by
which
they
were
environed
,
they
found
in
their
deep
mutual
love
a
shield
against
the
sharpest
arrows
of
fate
.
<EOS>
In
low
gentle
accents
they
breathed
their
passion
,
solemnly
plighting
their
faith
before
all
-
seeing
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
souls
!
<EOS>
they
were
happy
then
--
intensely
happy
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
that
their
happiness
should
be
so
short
;
for
those
few
moments
of
bliss
,
stolen
from
a
waste
of
tears
,
were
all
that
were
allowed
them
.
<EOS>
Inexorable
fate
still
dogged
their
footsteps
.
 
<EOS>
Amidst
the
bosquet
stood
a
listener
to
their
converse
--
a
little
girl
with
high
shoulders
and
sharp
features
,
on
which
diabolical
malice
was
stamped
.
<EOS>
Two
yellow
eyes
glistened
through
the
leaves
beside
her
,
marking
the
presence
of
a
cat
.
<EOS>
As
the
lovers
breathed
their
vows
,
and
indulged
in
hopes
never
to
be
realised
,
the
wicked
child
grinned
,
clenched
her
hands
,
and
,
grudging
them
their
short
-
lived
happiness
,
seemed
inclined
to
interrupt
it
.
<EOS>
Some
stronger
motive
,
however
,
kept
her
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
the
pair
talking
of
now?--She
hears
<EOS>
her
own
name
mentioned
by
the
maiden
,
who
speaks
of
her
with
pity
,
almost
with
affection
--
pardons
her
for
the
mischief
she
has
done
her
,
and
hopes
Heaven
will
pardon
her
likewise
.
<EOS>
But
she
knows
not
the
full
extent
of
the
girl
's
malignity
,
or
even
her
gentle
heart
must
have
been
roused
to
resentment
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
girl
,
however
,
feels
no
compunction
.
<EOS>
Infernal
malice
has
taken
possession
of
her
heart
,
and
crushed
every
kindly
feeling
within
it
.
<EOS>
She
hates
all
those
that
compassionate
her
,
and
returns
evil
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
the
lovers
talking
of
now
?
<EOS>
Of
their
first
meeting
at
Whalley
Abbey
,
when
one
was
May
Queen
,
and
by
her
beauty
and
simplicity
won
the
other
's
heart
,
losing
her
own
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
A
bright
unclouded
career
seemed
to
lie
before
them
then
.
<EOS>
Wofully
had
it
darkened
since
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
The
little
girl
smiles
.
<EOS>
She
hopes
they
will
go
on
.
<EOS>
She
likes
to
hear
them
talk
thus
.
<EOS>
Past
happiness
is
ever
remembered
with
a
pang
by
the
wretched
,
and
they
_
were
_
happy
then
.
<EOS>
Go
on
--
go
on
!
 
<EOS>
But
they
are
silent
for
awhile
,
for
they
wish
to
dwell
on
that
hopeful
,
that
blissful
season
.
<EOS>
And
a
nightingale
,
alighting
on
a
bough
above
them
,
pours
forth
its
sweet
plaint
,
as
if
in
response
to
their
tender
emotions
.
<EOS>
They
praise
the
bird
's
song
,
and
it
suddenly
ceases
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
little
girl
,
full
of
malevolence
,
stretches
forth
her
hand
,
and
it
drops
to
the
ground
,
as
if
stricken
by
a
dart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
thy
heart
broken
,
poor
bird
?
"
exclaimed
the
young
man
,
taking
up
the
hapless
songster
,
yet
warm
and
palpitating
.
"
<EOS>
To
die
in
the
midst
of
thy
song--'tis
hard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
hard
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
maiden
,
tearfully
.
"
<EOS>
Its
fate
seems
a
type
of
our
own
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
little
girl
laughed
,
but
in
a
low
tone
,
and
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
The
pair
then
grew
sad
.
<EOS>
This
slight
incident
had
touched
them
deeply
,
and
their
conversation
took
a
melancholy
turn
.
<EOS>
They
spoke
of
the
blights
that
had
nipped
their
love
in
the
bud
--
of
the
canker
that
had
eaten
into
its
heart
--
of
the
destiny
that
so
relentlessly
pursued
them
,
threatening
to
separate
them
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
girl
laughed
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
spoke
of
the
grave
--
and
of
hope
beyond
the
grave
;
and
they
spoke
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
girl
could
laugh
no
longer
,
for
with
her
all
beyond
the
grave
was
despair
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
they
spoke
of
the
terrible
power
that
Satan
had
lately
obtained
in
that
unhappy
district
,
of
the
arts
he
had
employed
,
and
of
the
votaries
he
had
won
.
<EOS>
Both
prayed
fervently
that
his
snares
might
be
circumvented
,
and
his
rule
destroyed
.
 
<EOS>
During
this
part
of
the
discourse
the
cat
swelled
to
the
size
of
a
tiger
,
and
his
eyes
glowed
like
fiery
coals
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
motion
as
if
he
would
spring
forward
,
but
the
voice
of
prayer
arrested
him
,
and
he
shrank
back
to
his
former
size
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Jennet
is
ensnared
by
the
Fiend
,
"
murmured
the
maiden
,
"
and
will
perish
eternally
.
<EOS>
Would
I
could
save
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
beyond
redemption
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
little
girl
gnashed
her
teeth
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
my
mother
--
I
do
not
now
<EOS>
despair
of
her
,
"
said
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
broken
the
bondage
by
which
she
was
enchained
,
and
,
if
she
resists
temptation
to
the
last
,
I
am
assured
will
be
saved
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
aid
her
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
the
words
uttered
,
than
the
cat
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Tib!--where
are
yo
,
Tib
?
<EOS>
Ey
want
yo
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
little
girl
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
familiar
did
not
respond
to
the
call
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
con
he
ha
'
gone
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Jennet
;
"
Tib
!
Tib
!
"
 
<EOS>
Still
the
cat
came
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
ey
mun
do
the
wark
without
him
,
"
pursued
the
little
girl
;
"
an
ey
win
no
longer
delay
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
this
she
crept
stealthily
round
the
arbour
,
and
,
approaching
the
side
where
Richard
sat
,
watched
an
opportunity
of
touching
him
unperceived
.
 
<EOS>
As
her
finger
came
in
contact
with
his
frame
,
a
pang
like
death
shot
through
his
heart
,
and
he
fell
upon
Alizon
's
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
ill
?
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
gazing
at
his
pallid
features
,
rendered
ghastly
white
by
the
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
could
make
no
reply
,
and
Alizon
,
becoming
dreadfully
alarmed
,
was
about
to
fly
for
assistance
,
but
the
young
man
,
by
a
great
effort
,
detained
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey
mun
now
run
an
tell
Mester
Potts
,
so
that
hoo
may
be
found
wi
'
him
,
"
muttered
Jennet
,
creeping
away
.
 
<EOS>
Just
then
Richard
recovered
his
speech
,
but
his
words
were
faintly
uttered
,
and
with
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
will
not
attempt
to
disguise
my
condition
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
dying
.
<EOS>
And
my
death
will
be
attributed
to
you
--
for
evil
-
minded
persons
have
persuaded
the
King
that
you
have
bewitched
me
,
and
he
will
believe
the
charge
now
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
would
ease
the
pangs
of
death
for
me
--
if
you
would
console
my
latest
moments
--
leave
me
,
and
quit
this
place
,
before
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Richard
,
"
she
cried
distractedly
;
"
you
ask
more
than
I
can
perform
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
indeed
in
such
imminent
danger
,
I
will
stay
with
you
--
will
die
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
live
for
me
--
live
--
save
yourself
,
Alizon
,
"
implored
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
Your
danger
is
greater
than
mine
.
<EOS>
A
dreadful
death
awaits
you
at
the
stake
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
mercy
,
mercy
,
heaven
!
<EOS>
Spare
her
--
in
pity
<EOS>
spare
<EOS>
her!--Have
<EOS>
we
not
suffered
enough
?
<EOS>
I
can
no
more
.
<EOS>
Farewell
for
ever
,
Alizon
--
one
kiss
--
the
last
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
their
lips
met
,
his
strength
utterly
forsook
him
,
and
he
fell
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
grave
!
"
<EOS>
he
murmured
;
"
one
grave
,
Alizon!"--And
<EOS>
so
,
without
a
groan
,
he
expired
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
neither
screamed
nor
swooned
,
but
remained
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
,
gazing
at
the
body
.
<EOS>
As
the
moon
fell
upon
the
placid
features
,
they
looked
as
if
locked
in
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
lay
--
<EOS>
the
young
,
the
brave
,
the
beautiful
,
the
loving
,
the
beloved
.
<EOS>
Fate
had
triumphed
.
<EOS>
Death
had
done
his
work
;
but
he
had
only
performed
half
his
task
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
grave
--
one
grave
<EOS>
--
it
was
his
last
wish
--
it
shall
be
so
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
in
frenzied
tones
,
"
I
shall
thus
escape
my
enemies
,
and
avoid
the
horrible
and
shameful
death
to
which
they
would
doom
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
snatched
the
dagger
from
the
ill
-
fated
youth
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
fate
,
I
defy
thee
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
with
a
fearful
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
One
last
look
at
that
calm
beautiful
face
--
one
kiss
of
the
cold
lips
,
which
can
no
more
return
the
endearment
--
and
<EOS>
the
dagger
is
pointed
at
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
is
withheld
by
an
arm
of
iron
,
and
the
weapon
falls
from
her
grasp
.
<EOS>
She
looks
up
.
<EOS>
A
tall
figure
,
clothed
in
the
mouldering
habiliments
of
a
Cistertian
monk
,
stands
beside
her
.
<EOS>
She
knows
the
vestments
at
once
,
for
she
has
seen
them
before
,
hanging
up
in
the
closet
adjoining
her
mother
's
chamber
at
Whalley
Abbey
--
and
the
features
of
the
ghostly
monk
seem
familiar
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Raise
not
thy
hand
against
thyself
,
"
said
the
phantom
,
in
a
tone
of
awful
reproof
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
Fiend
prompts
thee
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
advantage
of
thy
misery
to
destroy
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
took
thee
for
the
Fiend
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
gazing
at
him
with
wonder
rather
than
with
terror
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
art
thou
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
enemy
of
thy
enemies
,
and
therefore
thy
friend
,
"
replied
the
monk
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
saved
thy
lover
if
I
could
,
but
his
destiny
was
not
to
be
averted
.
<EOS>
But
,
rest
content
,
I
will
avenge
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
vengeance
--
I
want
to
be
with
him
,
"
she
replied
,
frantically
embracing
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
wilt
soon
be
with
him
,
"
said
the
phantom
,
in
tones
of
deep
significance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Arise
,
and
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
Thy
mother
needs
thy
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
mother
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Alizon
,
clearing
the
blinding
tresses
from
her
brow
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Follow
me
,
and
I
will
bring
thee
to
her
,
"
said
the
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
leave
him
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
,
gazing
wildly
at
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
.
<EOS>
A
soul
is
at
stake
,
and
will
perish
if
you
come
not
,
"
said
the
monk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
at
rest
,
and
you
will
speedily
rejoin
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
that
assurance
I
will
go
,
"
replied
Alizon
,
with
a
last
look
at
the
object
of
her
love
.
"
<EOS>
One
grave
--
lay
us
in
one
grave
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
done
according
to
your
wish
,
"
said
the
monk
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
glided
on
with
noiseless
footsteps
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
followed
him
along
the
terrace
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
they
came
to
a
dark
yew
-
tree
walk
,
leading
to
a
labyrinth
,
and
tracking
it
swiftly
,
as
well
as
the
overarched
and
intricate
path
to
which
it
conducted
,
they
entered
a
grotto
,
whence
a
flight
of
steps
descended
to
a
subterranean
passage
,
hewn
out
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
Along
this
passage
,
which
was
of
some
extent
,
the
monk
proceeded
,
and
Alizon
followed
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
they
came
to
another
flight
of
steps
,
and
here
the
monk
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
now
beneath
the
pavilion
,
where
you
will
find
your
mother
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Mount
!
<EOS>
the
way
is
clear
before
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
other
work
to
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
obeyed
;
and
,
as
she
advanced
,
was
surprised
to
find
the
monk
gone
.
<EOS>
He
had
neither
passed
her
nor
ascended
the
steps
,
and
must
,
therefore
,
have
sunk
into
the
earth
.

CHAPTER
XII.--THE
LAST
HOUR
.
  
<EOS>
Within
the
pavilion
sat
Alice
Nutter
.
<EOS>
She
was
clad
in
deep
mourning
,
but
her
dress
seemed
disordered
as
if
by
hasty
travel
.
<EOS>
Her
looks
were
full
of
anguish
and
terror
;
her
blanched
tresses
,
once
so
dark
and
beautiful
,
hung
dishevelled
over
her
shoulders
;
and
her
thin
hands
were
clasped
in
supplication
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
were
ashy
pale
,
but
on
her
brow
was
a
bright
red
mark
,
as
if
traced
by
a
finger
dipped
in
blood
.
 
<EOS>
A
lamp
was
burning
on
the
table
beside
her
.
<EOS>
Near
it
was
a
skull
,
and
near
this
emblem
of
mortality
an
hourglass
,
running
fast
.
 
<EOS>
The
windows
and
doors
of
the
building
were
closed
,
and
it
would
seem
the
unhappy
lady
was
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
brought
there
secretly
that
night
,
with
what
intent
<EOS>
she
knew
not
;
but
she
felt
sure
it
was
with
no
friendly
design
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
day
three
horsemen
had
arrived
at
her
retreat
in
Pendle
Forest
,
and
without
making
any
charge
against
her
,
or
explaining
whither
they
meant
to
take
her
,
or
indeed
answering
any
inquiry
,
had
brought
her
off
with
them
,
and
,
proceeding
across
the
country
,
had
arrived
at
a
forester
's
hut
on
the
outskirts
of
Hoghton
Park
.
<EOS>
Here
they
tarried
till
evening
,
placing
her
in
a
room
by
herself
,
and
keeping
strict
watch
over
her
;
and
when
the
shadows
of
night
fell
,
they
conveyed
her
through
the
woods
,
and
by
a
private
entrance
to
the
gardens
of
the
Tower
,
and
with
equal
secresy
to
the
pavilion
,
where
,
setting
a
lamp
before
her
,
they
left
her
to
her
meditations
.
<EOS>
All
refused
to
answer
her
inquiries
,
but
one
of
them
,
with
a
sinister
smile
,
placed
the
hourglass
and
skull
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
the
wretched
lady
vainly
sought
some
solution
of
the
enigma
--
why
she
had
been
brought
thither
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
solve
it
;
but
she
determined
,
if
her
capture
had
been
made
by
any
lawful
authorities
,
to
confess
her
guilt
and
submit
to
condign
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
windows
and
doors
were
closed
as
before
mentioned
,
sounds
from
without
reached
her
,
and
she
heard
confused
and
tumultuous
noises
as
if
from
a
large
assemblage
.
<EOS>
For
what
purpose
were
they
met
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
for
her
execution
?
<EOS>
No
--
there
were
strains
of
music
,
and
bursts
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
had
heard
that
the
burning
of
a
witch
was
a
spectacle
in
which
the
populace
delighted
--
that
they
looked
upon
it
as
a
show
,
like
any
other
;
and
why
should
they
not
laugh
,
and
have
music
at
it
?
<EOS>
But
could
she
be
executed
without
trial
,
without
judgment
?
<EOS>
She
knew
not
.
<EOS>
All
she
knew
was
she
was
guilty
,
and
deserved
to
die
.
<EOS>
But
when
this
idea
took
possession
of
her
,
the
laughter
sounded
in
her
ears
like
the
yells
of
demons
,
and
the
strains
like
the
fearful
harmonies
she
had
heard
at
weird
sabbaths
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
she
recollected
with
indescribable
terror
,
that
on
this
very
night
the
compact
she
had
entered
into
with
the
Fiend
expired
.
<EOS>
That
at
midnight
,
unless
by
her
penitence
and
prayers
she
had
worked
out
her
salvation
,
he
could
claim
her
.
<EOS>
She
recollected
also
,
and
with
increased
uneasiness
,
that
the
man
who
had
set
the
hourglass
on
the
table
,
and
who
had
regarded
her
with
a
sinister
smile
as
he
did
so
,
had
said
it
was
eleven
o'clock
!
<EOS>
Her
last
hour
then
had
arrived
--
nay
,
was
partly
spent
,
and
the
moments
were
passing
swiftly
by
.
 
<EOS>
The
agony
she
endured
at
this
thought
was
intense
.
<EOS>
She
felt
as
if
reason
were
forsaking
her
,
and
,
but
for
her
determined
efforts
to
resist
it
,
such
a
crisis
might
have
occurred
.
<EOS>
But
she
knew
that
her
eternal
welfare
depended
upon
the
preservation
of
her
mental
balance
,
and
she
strove
to
maintain
it
,
and
in
the
end
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
Her
gaze
was
fixed
intently
on
the
hourglass
.
<EOS>
She
saw
the
sand
trickling
silently
but
swiftly
down
,
like
a
current
of
life
-
blood
,
which
,
when
it
ceased
,
life
would
cease
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
saw
the
shining
grains
above
insensibly
diminishing
in
quantity
,
and
,
as
if
she
could
arrest
her
destiny
by
the
act
,
she
seized
the
glass
,
and
would
have
turned
it
,
but
the
folly
of
the
proceeding
arrested
her
,
and
she
set
it
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
Then
horrible
thoughts
came
upon
her
,
crushing
her
and
overwhelming
her
,
and
she
felt
by
anticipation
all
the
torments
she
would
speedily
have
to
endure
.
<EOS>
Oceans
of
fire
,
in
which
miserable
souls
were
for
ever
tossing
,
rolled
before
her
.
<EOS>
Yells
,
such
as
no
human
anguish
can
produce
,
smote
her
ears
.
<EOS>
Monsters
of
frightful
form
yawned
to
devour
her
.
<EOS>
Fiends
,
armed
with
terrible
implements
of
torture
,
such
as
the
wildest
imagination
can
not
paint
,
menaced
her
.
<EOS>
All
hell
,
and
its
horrors
,
was
there
,
its
dreadful
gulf
,
its
roaring
furnaces
,
its
rivers
of
molten
metal
,
ever
burning
,
yet
never
consuming
its
victims
.
<EOS>
A
hot
sulphureous
atmosphere
oppressed
her
,
and
a
film
of
blood
dimmed
her
sight
.
 
<EOS>
She
endeavoured
to
pray
,
but
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
She
looked
about
for
her
Bible
,
but
it
had
been
left
behind
when
she
was
taken
from
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
safeguard
--
none
.
 
<EOS>
Still
the
sand
ran
on
.
 
<EOS>
New
agonies
assailed
her
.
<EOS>
Hell
was
before
her
again
,
but
in
a
new
form
,
and
with
new
torments
.
<EOS>
She
closed
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
shut
her
ears
.
<EOS>
But
she
saw
it
still
,
and
heard
its
terrific
yells
.
 
<EOS>
Again
she
consults
the
hourglass
.
<EOS>
The
sand
is
running
on
--
ever
diminishing
.
 
<EOS>
New
torments
assail
her
.
<EOS>
She
thinks
of
all
she
loves
most
on
earth
--
of
her
daughter
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
Alizon
were
near
her
,
she
might
pray
for
her
--
might
scare
away
these
frightful
visions
--
might
save
her
.
<EOS>
She
calls
to
her
--
but
she
answers
not
.
<EOS>
No
,
she
is
utterly
abandoned
of
God
and
man
,
and
must
perish
eternally
.
 
<EOS>
Again
she
consults
the
hourglass
.
<EOS>
One
quarter
of
an
hour
is
all
that
remains
to
her
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
that
she
could
employ
it
in
prayer
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
she
could
kneel
--
or
even
weep
!
 
<EOS>
A
large
mirror
hangs
against
the
wall
,
and
she
is
drawn
towards
it
by
an
irresistible
impulse
.
<EOS>
She
sees
a
figure
within
it
--
but
she
does
not
know
herself
.
<EOS>
Can
that
cadaverous
object
,
with
the
white
hair
,
that
seems
newly
-
arisen
from
the
grave
,
be
she
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
a
phantom
.
<EOS>
No
--
she
touches
her
cheek
,
and
finds
it
is
real
.
<EOS>
But
,
ah
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
red
brand
upon
her
brow
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
seal
of
the
demon
.
<EOS>
She
tries
to
efface
it
--
but
it
will
not
come
out
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
becomes
redder
and
deeper
.
 
<EOS>
Again
she
consults
the
glass
.
<EOS>
The
sand
is
still
running
on
.
<EOS>
How
many
minutes
remain
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
"
Ten
!
"
cried
a
voice
,
replying
to
her
mental
inquiry.--"Ten
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
turning
,
she
perceived
her
familiar
standing
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
time
is
wellnigh
out
,
Alice
Nutter
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
In
ten
minutes
my
lord
will
claim
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
compact
with
thy
master
is
broken
,
"
she
replied
,
summoning
up
all
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
long
ceased
to
use
the
power
bestowed
upon
me
;
but
,
even
if
I
had
wished
it
,
thou
hast
refused
to
serve
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
refused
to
serve
you
,
madam
,
because
you
have
disobeyed
the
express
injunctions
of
my
master
,
"
replied
the
familiar
;
"
but
your
apostasy
does
not
free
you
from
bondage
.
<EOS>
You
have
merely
lost
advantages
which
you
might
have
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
If
you
chose
to
dismiss
me
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
I
nor
my
lord
have
been
to
blame
.
<EOS>
We
have
performed
our
part
of
the
contract
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
am
I
brought
hither
?
"
demanded
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
"
replied
the
familiar
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
brought
here
by
order
of
the
King
.
<EOS>
Your
retreat
was
revealed
to
him
by
Master
Potts
,
who
learnt
it
from
Jennet
Device
.
<EOS>
The
sapient
sovereign
intended
to
confront
you
with
your
daughter
Alizon
,
who
,
like
yourself
,
is
accused
of
witchcraft
;
but
he
will
be
disappointed
--
for
when
he
comes
for
you
,
you
will
be
out
of
his
reach
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
rubbed
his
hands
at
the
jest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
accused
of
witchcraft
--
say'st
thou
?
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
the
familiar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
is
suspected
of
bewitching
Richard
Assheton
,
who
has
been
done
to
death
by
Jennet
Device
.
<EOS>
For
one
so
young
,
the
little
girl
has
certainly
a
rare
turn
for
mischief
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
will
know
the
real
author
of
the
crime
,
and
Alizon
will
suffer
for
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
will
not
suffer
such
iniquity
,
"
said
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
heaven
,
madam
,
it
is
needless
to
refer
to
it
,
"
said
the
familiar
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
certainly
is
rather
hard
that
one
so
young
as
Alizon
should
perish
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
save
her
?
"
asked
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
_
could
_
save
her
,
but
she
will
not
let
me
,
"
replied
the
familiar
,
with
a
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
no
--
it
is
impossible
,
"
cried
the
wretched
woman
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
help
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
might
,
"
observed
the
tempter
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
,
whom
you
accuse
of
harshness
,
is
ever
willing
to
oblige
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
few
minutes
left
--
do
you
wish
him
to
aid
her
?
<EOS>
Command
me
,
and
I
will
obey
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
some
snare
,
"
thought
Mistress
Nutter
;
"
I
will
resist
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
worse
off
than
you
are
,
"
remarked
the
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
that
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
would'st
thou
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
command
me
,
madam
.
<EOS>
I
can
,
do
nothing
of
my
own
accord
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
bring
your
daughter
here
?
<EOS>
Say
so
,
and
it
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
thou
would'st
ensnare
me
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
well
know
<EOS>
thou
hast
<EOS>
no
power
over
her
.
<EOS>
Thou
would'st
place
some
phantasm
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
see
her
,
but
not
through
thy
agency
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
here
,
"
cried
Alizon
,
opening
the
door
of
a
closet
,
and
rushing
towards
her
mother
,
who
instantly
locked
her
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
for
me
,
my
child
,
"
cried
Mistress
Nutter
,
mastering
her
emotion
,
"
or
I
shall
be
snatched
from
you
for
ever
.
<EOS>
My
moments
are
numbered
.
<EOS>
Pray
--
pray
!
"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
fell
on
her
knees
,
and
prayed
fervently
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
waste
your
breath
,
"
cried
the
familiar
,
in
a
mocking
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Never
till
the
brand
shall
disappear
from
her
brow
,
and
the
writing
,
traced
in
her
blood
,
shall
vanish
from
this
parchment
,
can
she
be
saved
.
<EOS>
She
is
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Alizon
,
pray
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tear
her
in
pieces
if
she
does
not
cease
,
"
cried
the
familiar
,
assuming
a
terrible
shape
,
and
menacing
her
with
claws
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
thou
,
mother
!
"
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
kill
her
if
she
but
makes
the
attempt
,
"
howled
the
demon
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
try
,
mother
,
try
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
lady
dropped
on
her
knees
,
and
raised
her
hands
in
humble
supplication--"Heaven
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
The
demon
seized
the
hourglass
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
sand
is
out
--
her
term
has
expired
--
she
is
mine
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Clasp
thy
arms
tightly
round
me
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
take
me
from
thee
,
"
shrieked
the
agonised
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Release
her
,
Alizon
,
or
I
will
slay
thee
likewise
,
"
roared
the
demon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
she
replied
;
"
thou
canst
not
overcome
me
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
joyfully
,
"
the
brand
has
disappeared
from
her
brow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
writing
from
the
parchment
,
"
howled
the
demon
;
"
but
I
will
have
her
notwithstanding
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
plunged
his
claws
into
Alice
Nutter
's
flesh
.
<EOS>
But
her
daughter
held
her
fast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
hold
me
,
my
child
--
hold
me
,
or
I
am
lost
!
"
shrieked
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
warned
,
and
let
her
go
,
or
thy
life
shall
pay
for
her
's
,
"
cried
the
demon
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
life
for
her
's
,
willingly
,
"
replied
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
take
thy
fate
,
"
rejoined
the
evil
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
And
placing
his
hand
upon
her
heart
,
it
instantly
ceased
to
beat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
thou
art
saved
--
saved
!
"
exclaimed
Alizon
,
throwing
out
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
And
gazing
at
her
for
an
instant
with
a
seraphic
look
,
she
fell
backwards
,
and
expired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
mine
,
"
roared
the
demon
,
seizing
Mistress
Nutter
by
the
hair
,
and
dragging
her
from
her
daughter
's
body
,
to
which
she
clung
desperately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help!--help
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
mayst
call
,
but
thy
cries
will
be
unheeded
,
"
rejoined
the
familiar
with
mocking
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
liest
,
false
fiend
!
"
said
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
will
help
me
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
she
spoke
,
the
Cistertian
monk
stood
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hence
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
with
an
imperious
gesture
to
the
demon
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
no
longer
in
thy
power
.
<EOS>
Hence
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
a
howl
of
rage
and
disappointment
the
familiar
vanished
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alice
Nutter
,
"
continued
the
monk
,
"
thy
safety
has
been
purchased
at
the
price
of
thy
daughter
's
life
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
of
little
moment
,
for
she
could
not
live
long
.
<EOS>
Her
gentle
heart
was
broken
,
and
,
when
the
demon
stopped
it
for
ever
,
he
performed
unintentionally
a
merciful
act
.
<EOS>
She
must
rest
in
the
same
grave
with
him
<EOS>
she
loved
so
well
during
life
.
<EOS>
This
tell
to
those
who
will
come
to
thee
anon
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
delivered
from
the
yoke
of
Satan
.
<EOS>
Full
expiation
has
been
made
.
<EOS>
But
earthly
justice
must
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Thou
must
pay
the
penalty
for
crimes
committed
in
the
flesh
,
but
what
thou
sufferest
here
shall
avail
thee
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
content
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pass
the
rest
of
thy
life
in
penitence
and
prayer
,
"
pursued
the
monk
,
"
and
let
nothing
divert
thee
from
it
;
for
,
though
free
now
,
thou
wilt
be
subject
to
evil
influence
and
temptations
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Remember
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
--
I
will
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
he
said
,
"
kneel
beside
thy
daughter
's
body
and
pray
.
<EOS>
I
will
return
to
thee
ere
many
minutes
be
passed
.
<EOS>
One
task
more
,
<EOS>
and
then
my
mission
is
ended
.

CHAPTER
XIII.--THE
MASQUE
OF
DEATH
.
  
<EOS>
Short
time
as
he
had
to
await
,
James
was
unable
to
control
his
impatience
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
arose
,
and
,
completely
sobered
by
the
recent
strange
events
,
descended
the
steps
of
the
platform
,
and
walked
on
without
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
keep
back
the
crowd
,
"
he
said
to
an
officer
,
"
and
let
none
follow
me
but
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
,
and
Master
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
When
I
call
,
let
the
prisoners
be
brought
forward
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
Majesty
shall
be
obeyed
,
"
replied
the
baronet
,
giving
the
necessary
directions
.
 
<EOS>
James
then
moved
slowly
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
pavilion
;
and
,
as
he
went
,
called
Nicholas
Assheton
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wha
was
that
officer
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
pardon
,
my
liege
,
but
<EOS>
I
can
not
answer
the
question
,
"
replied
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
,
sir
?
"
demanded
the
monarch
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
reasons
I
will
hereafter
render
to
your
Majesty
,
and
which
I
am
persuaded
you
will
find
satisfactory
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
,
weel
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
you
are
right
,
"
said
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
think
he
will
keep
his
word
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
returned
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
time
is
come
,
then
!
"
exclaimed
James
impatiently
,
and
looking
up
at
the
pavilion
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
time
is
come
!
"
echoed
a
sepulchral
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
speak
?
"
inquired
the
monarch
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sire
,
"
replied
Nicholas
;
"
but
some
one
seemed
to
give
you
intimation
that
all
is
ready
.
<EOS>
Will
it
please
you
to
go
on
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enter
!
"
cried
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wha
speaks
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
King
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
no
answer
was
returned
,
he
continued--"I
will
not
set
foot
in
the
structure
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
snare
of
Satan
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
the
shutters
of
the
windows
flew
open
,
showing
that
the
pavilion
was
lighted
up
by
many
tapers
within
,
while
solemn
strains
of
music
issued
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enter
!
"
repeated
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
no
fear
,
sire
,
"
said
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
canna
be
<EOS>
the
wark
o
'
the
deil
,
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
He
does
not
delight
in
holy
hymns
and
sweet
music
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
solemn
dirge
for
the
dead
,
"
observed
Nicholas
,
as
melodious
voices
mingled
with
the
music
.
 
<EOS>
"
Weel
,
weel
,
I
will
go
on
at
a
'
hazards
,
"
said
James
.
 
<EOS>
The
doors
flew
open
as
the
King
and
his
attendants
approached
,
and
,
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
through
them
,
the
valves
swung
back
to
their
places
.
 
<EOS>
A
strange
sad
spectacle
met
their
gaze
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
chamber
stood
a
bier
,
covered
with
a
velvet
pall
,
and
on
it
the
bodies
of
a
youth
and
maiden
were
deposited
.
<EOS>
Pale
and
beautiful
were
they
as
sculptured
marble
,
and
a
smile
sat
upon
their
features
.
<EOS>
Side
by
side
they
were
lying
,
with
their
arms
enfolded
,
as
if
they
had
died
in
each
other
's
embrace
.
<EOS>
A
wreath
of
yew
and
cypress
was
placed
above
their
heads
,
and
flowers
were
scattered
round
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
Richard
and
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
deeply
touching
sight
,
and
for
some
time
none
spake
.
<EOS>
The
solemn
dirge
continued
,
interrupted
only
by
the
stifled
sobs
of
the
listeners
.
 
<EOS>
"
Both
gone
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Nicholas
,
in
accents
broken
by
emotion
;
"
and
so
young
--
so
good
--
so
beautiful
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
have
bewitched
him
,
"
said
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
was
all
purity
and
goodness
,
"
cried
Nicholas
,
"
and
is
now
numbered
with
the
angels
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
guilty
one
is
in
thy
hands
,
O
King
!
"
said
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
for
thee
to
punish
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
will
not
hold
my
hand
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Devices
shall
assuredly
perish
.
<EOS>
When
I
go
from
this
chamber
,
I
will
have
them
conveyed
under
a
strong
escort
to
Lancaster
Castle
.
<EOS>
They
shall
die
by
the
hands
of
the
common
executioner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
mission
,
then
,
is
complete
,
"
replied
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
rest
in
peace
.
"
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
art
thou
?
"
demanded
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
who
sinned
deeply
,
but
is
now
pardoned
,
"
replied
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
for
a
moment
lost
in
reflection
,
and
then
turned
to
depart
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
kneeling
figure
,
whom
no
one
had
hitherto
noticed
,
arose
from
behind
the
bier
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
lady
,
robed
in
mourning
.
<EOS>
So
ghastly
pale
were
her
features
,
and
<EOS>
so
skeleton
-
like
her
attenuated
frame
,
that
James
thought
he
beheld
a
spectre
,
and
recoiled
in
terror
.
<EOS>
The
figure
advanced
slowly
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
,
and
what
art
thou
,
in
Heaven
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
he
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
Alice
Nutter
,
sire
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
prostrating
herself
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alice
Nutter
,
the
witch
!
"
cried
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
Why
--
ay
,
I
recollect
thou
wert
here
.
<EOS>
I
sent
for
thee
,
but
recent
terrible
events
had
put
thee
clean
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
But
expect
no
grace
from
me
,
evil
woman
.
<EOS>
I
will
show
thee
none
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
none
,
sire
,
"
replied
the
penitent
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
place
myself
in
your
hands
,
that
justice
may
be
done
upon
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
James
.
<EOS>
"
Dost
thou
,
indeed
,
repent
thee
of
thy
iniquities
?
<EOS>
Dost
thou
abjure
<EOS>
the
devil
and
all
his
works
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
"
My
compact
with
the
Evil
One
has
been
broken
by
the
prayers
of
my
devoted
daughter
,
who
sacrificed
herself
for
me
,
and
thereby
saved
my
soul
alive
.
<EOS>
But
human
justice
requires
an
expiation
,
and
I
am
anxious
to
make
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Arise
,
ill
-
fated
woman
,
"
said
the
king
,
much
moved
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
to
Lancaster
,
but
,
in
consideration
of
your
penitence
,
no
indignity
shall
be
shown
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
strictly
guarded
,
but
you
shall
not
be
taken
with
the
other
prisoners
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
humbly
thank
your
Majesty
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
May
I
take
a
last
farewell
of
my
child
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
so
,
"
replied
James
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
Nutter
then
approached
the
bier
,
and
,
after
gazing
for
a
moment
with
deepest
fondness
upon
the
features
of
her
daughter
,
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
her
marble
brow
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
her
tears
fell
fast
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
weep
,
I
see
,
"
observed
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
witch
no
longer
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
I
can
weep
,
"
she
replied
;
"
and
so
ease
my
over
-
burthened
heart
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
sire
,
none
but
those
who
have
experienced
it
can
tell
the
agony
of
being
denied
this
relief
of
nature
.
<EOS>
Farewell
for
ever
,
my
blessed
child
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
kissing
her
brow
again
;
"
and
you
,
too
,
her
beloved
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
Assheton
--
it
was
her
wish
to
be
buried
in
the
same
grave
with
Richard
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
it
done
,
Nicholas
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
--
I
will
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
squire
,
in
a
voice
of
deepest
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
likewise
promise
it
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
They
shall
rest
together
in
Whalley
churchyard
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
that
Sir
Richard
and
Dorothy
are
gone
,
"
he
observed
to
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
indeed
,
"
said
the
squire
,
"
or
we
should
have
had
another
funeral
to
perform
.
<EOS>
Pray
Heaven
<EOS>
it
be
not
so
now
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
other
request
to
prefer
?
"
demanded
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
sire
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
"
except
that
I
wish
to
make
full
restitution
of
all
the
land
I
have
robbed
him
of
,
to
Master
Roger
Nowell
;
and
,
as
some
compensation
,
I
would
fain
add
certain
lands
adjoining
,
which
have
been
conveyed
over
to
Sir
Ralph
and
Nicholas
Assheton
,
only
annexing
the
condition
that
a
small
sum
annually
be
given
in
dole
to
the
poor
of
the
parish
,
that
I
may
be
remembered
in
their
prayers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
it
done
,
"
said
Sir
Ralph
and
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
will
see
my
part
fulfilled
,
"
said
Nowell
.
<EOS>
"
For
any
wrong
you
have
done
me
I
now
freely
and
fully
forgive
you
,
and
may
Heaven
in
its
infinite
mercy
forgive
you
likewise
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
ejaculated
the
monarch
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
others
joined
in
the
ejaculation
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
then
moved
to
the
door
,
which
was
opened
for
him
by
the
two
Asshetons
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
the
steps
stood
Master
Potts
,
attended
by
an
officer
of
the
guard
and
a
party
of
halberdiers
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
them
,
with
their
hands
tied
behind
their
backs
,
were
Jem
Device
,
his
mother
,
Jennet
,
and
poor
Nance
Redferne
.
<EOS>
Jem
looked
dogged
and
sullen
,
Elizabeth
downcast
,
but
Jennet
retained
her
accustomed
malignant
expression

<EOS>
Poor
Nance
was
the
only
one
who
excited
any
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Jennet
's
malice
seemed
now
directed
against
Master
Potts
,
whom
she
charged
with
having
betrayed
and
deceived
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
Tib

tear
thee

she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Monster

"
exclaimed
the
indignant
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
If

opprobrious
epithets
I

<EOS>
You

Yo

Jennet
,
"

"
she
vociferated
,
as
James
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
pavilion
.
"
<EOS>
Yo

ensnare
Alizon

<EOS>
"
Stop

cried
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nah

cried
Jennet

<EOS>
"
All

your
Majesty

all

cried
the
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Malice
,
nae

,
in
great
pairt

"
replied
James
;
"
but
some
truth
as
weel
,
I
fear
,
sir
.
<EOS>
And
in
any
case
it
will
prevent
my
doing
any

"
 
<EOS>
"
There
,
you
have
ruined

<EOS>
cried
Potts
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ey'm

said
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Take
the
prisoners
away
,
and
let
them
be
conveyed
under
a
strict
escort
to
Lancaster
Castle
,
"
said
James
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
as
the
assizes
commence
next
week
,
quick
work
will
be
made
with
them
,
your
Majesty
,
"
observed
Potts
.
<EOS>
"
Their
guilt
can
be
incontestably
proved
,
so
they
are
sure
to
be
found
guilty
,
sure
to
be
hanged
,
sire
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
prisoners
were
removed
,
Nance
Redferne
looked
round
her
,
and
,
catching
the
eye
of
Nicholas
,
made
a
slight
motion
with
her
head
,
as
if
bidding
him
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
The
squire
returned
the
mute
valediction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Nance
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
compassionately
,
"
I
sincerely
pity
her
.
<EOS>
Would
there
was
any
means
of
saving
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
none
,
"
observed
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
may
be
thankful
<EOS>
you
are
not
brought
in
as
her
accomplice
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Jennet
was
taken
away
,
she
continued
to
hurl
threats
and
imprecations
against
Potts
.
 
<EOS>
Another
officer
of
the
guard
was
then
summoned
,
and
when
he
came
,
James
said
,
"
One
other
prisoner
remains
within
the
pavilion
.
<EOS>
She
likewise
must
be
conveyed
to
Lancaster
Castle
but
in
a
litter
,
and
not
with
the
other
prisoners
.
"
 
<EOS>
Attended
by
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
the
monarch
then
proceeded
to
his
lodgings
in
the
Tower
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIV.--"ONE
GRAVE
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
sad
occurrences
above
detailed
,
James
remained
for
two
more
days
the
guest
of
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
enjoying
his
princely
hospitality
,
hunting
in
the
park
,
carousing
in
the
great
hall
,
and
witnessing
all
kinds
of
sports
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
,
indeed
,
was
left
to
remind
him
of
the
sad
events
that
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
prisoners
were
taken
that
night
to
Lancaster
Castle
,
and
Master
Potts
accompanied
the
escort
,
to
be
ready
for
the
assizes
.
<EOS>
The
three
judges
proceeded
thither
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
The
attendance
of
Roger
Nowell
,
Nicholas
,
and
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
was
also
required
as
witnesses
at
the
trial
of
the
witches
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Assheton
and
Dorothy
had
returned
,
as
already
stated
,
to
Middleton
;
and
,
though
the
intelligence
of
the
death
of
Richard
and
Alizon
was
communicated
to
them
with
infinite
caution
,
the
shock
to
both
was
very
great
,
especially
to
Dorothy
,
who
was
long
--
very
long
--
in
recovering
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
's
vivacity
of
temperament
made
him
feel
the
loss
of
his
cousin
at
first
very
keenly
,
but
it
soon
wore
off
.
<EOS>
He
vowed
amendment
and
reformation
on
the
model
of
John
Bruen
,
whose
life
offered
so
striking
a
contrast
to
his
own
,
that
it
has
very
properly
been
placed
in
opposition
by
a
reverend
moralist
;
but
I
regret
to
say
that
he
did
not
carry
out
his
praiseworthy
intentions
.
<EOS>
He
was
apt
to
make
a
joke
of
John
Bruen
,
instead
of
imitating
his
example
.
<EOS>
He
professed
to
devote
himself
to
his
excellent
wife
--
but
his
old
habits
would
break
out
;
and
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
he
was
often
to
be
found
in
the
alehouse
,
and
was
just
as
fond
of
horse
-
racing
,
cock
-
fighting
,
hunting
,
fishing
,
and
all
other
sports
,
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
he
occupied
a
leisure
or
a
rainy
day
with
a
Journal,[6
]
<EOS>
parts
of
which
have
been
preserved
;
but
he
set
down
in
it
few
of
the
terrible
events
here
related
,
probably
because
they
were
of
too
painful
a
nature
to
be
recorded
.
<EOS>
He
died
in
1625
-
-at
the
early
age
of
thirty
-
five
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
the
tragical
events
at
Hoghton
Tower
,
the
whole
village
of
Whalley
was
astir
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
no
festive
occasion
--
no
merry
-
making
--
<EOS>
that
called
forth
the
inhabitants
,
for
grief
sat
upon
every
countenance
.
<EOS>
The
day
,
too
,
was
gloomy
.
<EOS>
The
feathered
summits
of
Whalley
Nab
were
wreathed
in
mist
,
and
a
fine
rain
descended
in
the
valley
.
<EOS>
The
Calder
looked
dull
and
discoloured
as
it
flowed
past
the
walls
of
the
ancient
Abbey
.
<EOS>
The
church
bell
tolled
mournfully
,
and
a
large
concourse
was
gathered
in
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
one
of
the
three
crosses
of
Paulinus
,
which
stood
nearest
the
church
porch
,
a
grave
had
been
digged
,
and
almost
every
one
looked
into
it
.
<EOS>
The
grave
,
it
was
said
,
was
intended
to
hold
two
coffins
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
a
train
of
mourners
issued
from
the
ancient
Abbey
gateway
,
and
sure
enough
there
were
two
coffins
on
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
;
They
were
met
at
the
gate
by
Doctor
Ormerod
,
who
was
so
deeply
affected
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
perform
the
needful
offices
for
the
dead
.
<EOS>
The
principal
mourners
were
Sir
Richard
Assheton
of
Middleton
,
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
and
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
Amid
the
tears
and
sobs
of
all
the
bystanders
,
the
bodies
of
Richard
and
Alizon
were
committed
to
the
earth
--
laid
together
in
one
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
was
their
latest
wish
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
Flowers
grew
upon
the
turf
that
covered
them
,
and
there
was
the
earliest
primrose
seen
,
and
the
latest
violet
.
<EOS>
Many
a
fond
youth
and
trusting
maiden
have
visited
their
lowly
tomb
,
and
many
a
tear
,
fresh
from
the
heart
,
has
dropped
upon
the
sod
covering
the
ill
-
fated
lovers
.

CHAPTER
XV.--LANCASTER
CASTLE
.
  
<EOS>
Behold
the
grim
and
giant
fabric
,
rebuilt
and
strengthened
by
           
<EOS>
"
Old
John
of
Gaunt
,
time
-
honour'd
Lancaster
!
"
 
<EOS>
Within
one
of
its
turrets
called
John
of
Gaunt
's
Chair
,
and
at
eventide
,
stands
a
lady
under
the
care
of
a
jailer
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
last
sunset
she
will
ever
see
--
the
last
time
she
will
look
upon
the
beauties
of
earth
;
for
she
is
a
prisoner
,
condemned
to
die
an
ignominious
and
terrible
death
,
and
her
execution
will
take
place
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Leaving
her
alone
within
the
turret
,
the
jailer
locks
the
door
and
stands
outside
it
.
<EOS>
The
lady
casts
a
long
,
lingering
look
around
.
<EOS>
All
nature
seems
so
beautiful
--
so
attractive
.
<EOS>
The
sunset
upon
the
broad
watery
sands
of
Morecambe
Bay
is
exquisite
in
varied
tints
.
<EOS>
The
fells
of
Furness
look
black
and
bold
,
and
the
windings
of
the
Lune
are
clearly
traced
out
.
<EOS>
But
she
casts
a
wistful
glance
towards
the
mountainous
ridges
of
Lancashire
,
and
fancies
she
can
detect
amongst
the
heights
the
rounded
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
Then
her
gaze
settles
upon
the
grey
old
town
beneath
her
,
and
,
as
her
glance
wanders
over
it
<EOS>
,
certain
terrible
objects
arrest
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
area
before
the
Castle
she
sees
a
ring
of
tall
stakes
.
<EOS>
She
knows
well
their
purpose
,
and
counts
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
thirteen
in
number
.
<EOS>
Thirteen
wretched
beings
are
to
be
burned
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
the
stakes
are
an
enormous
pile
of
fagots
.
<EOS>
All
is
prepared
.
<EOS>
Fascinated
by
the
sight
,
she
remains
gazing
at
the
place
of
execution
for
some
time
,
and
when
she
turns
,
she
beholds
a
tall
dark
man
standing
beside
her
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
thinks
it
is
the
jailer
,
and
is
about
to
tell
the
man
she
is
ready
to
descend
to
her
cell
,
when
she
recognises
him
,
and
recoils
in
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
here
--
again
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
save
thee
from
the
stake
,
if
thou
wilt
,
Alice
Nutter
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hence
!
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Thou
temptest
me
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Hence
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
a
howl
of
rage
the
demon
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
Conveyed
back
to
her
cell
,
situated
within
the
dread
Dungeon
Tower
<EOS>
,
Alice
Nutter
passed
the
whole
of
that
night
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
Towards
four
o'clock
,
wearied
out
,
she
dropped
into
a
slumber
;
and
when
the
clergyman
,
from
whom
she
had
received
spiritual
consolation
,
came
to
her
cell
,
he
found
her
still
sleeping
,
but
with
a
sweet
smile
upon
her
lips
--
the
first
he
had
ever
beheld
there
.
 
<EOS>
Unwilling
to
disturb
her
,
he
knelt
down
and
prayed
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
jailer
came
,
and
the
executioner
's
aids
.
<EOS>
The
divine
then
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
,
and
she
instantly
arose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
,
"
she
said
,
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
a
happy
dream
,
daughter
,
"
he
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
blessed
dream
,
reverend
sir
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
saw
my
children
,
Richard
and
Alizon
,
in
a
fair
garden
--
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
angelic
they
looked
--
and
they
told
me
I
should
be
with
them
soon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
doubt
not
the
vision
will
be
realised
,
"
replied
the
clergyman
.
<EOS>
"
Your
redemption
is
fully
worked
out
,
and
your
salvation
,
I
trust
,
secured
.
<EOS>
And
now
you
must
prepare
for
your
last
trial
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
fully
prepared
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
will
you
not
go
to
the
others
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
daughter
,
"
he
replied
,
"
they
all
,
excepting
Nance
Redferne
,
refuse
my
services
,
and
will
perish
in
their
iniquities
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
go
to
her
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
entreat
of
you
,
"
she
said
;
"
she
may
yet
be
saved
.
<EOS>
But
what
of
Jennet
?
<EOS>
Is
she
,
too
,
to
die
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
divine
;
"
being
evidence
against
her
relatives
,
her
life
is
spared
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
grant
<EOS>
she
do
no
more
mischief
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Alice
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
submitted
herself
to
the
executioner
's
assistants
,
and
was
led
forth
.
<EOS>
On
issuing
into
the
open
air
a
change
came
over
her
,
and
such
an
exceeding
faintness
that
she
had
to
be
supported
.
<EOS>
She
was
led
towards
the
stake
in
this
state
;
but
she
grew
fainter
and
fainter
,
and
at
last
fell
back
in
the
arms
of
the
men
that
supported
her
.
<EOS>
Still
they
carried
her
on
.
<EOS>
When
the
executioner
put
out
his
hand
to
receive
her
from
his
aids
,
she
was
found
to
be
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
tied
her
to
the
stake
,
and
her
body
was
consumed
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
spectators
beheld
those
terrible
fires
,
and
exulted
in
the
torments
of
the
miserable
sufferers
.
<EOS>
Their
shrieks
and
blasphemies
were
terrific
,
and
the
place
resembled
a
hell
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Jennet
escaped
,
to
the
dismay
of
Master
Potts
,
who
feared
she
would
wreak
her
threatened
vengeance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
he
did
suffer
from
aches
and
cramps
,
which
he
attributed
to
her
;
but
which
were
more
reasonably
supposed
to
be
owing
to
rheum
caught
in
the
marshes
of
Pendle
Forest
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
the
pleasure
of
assisting
at
her
execution
,
when
some
years
afterwards
retributive
justice
overtook
her
.
 
<EOS>
Jennet
was
the
last
of
the
Lancashire
Witches
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
then
witchcraft
has
taken
a
new
form
with
the
ladies
of
the
county
--
though
their
fascination
and
spells
are
as
potent
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Few
can
now
escape
them,--few
desire
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
to
all

A
similar
eruption
occurred
at
Pendle
Hill
in
August
,
1669
,
and
has
been
described
by
Mr.
Charles
Townley
,
in
a
letter
cited
by
Dr.
Whitaker
in
his
excellent
"
History
of
Whalley
.
<EOS>
"
Other
and
more
formidable
eruptions
had
taken
place
previously
,
occasioning
much
damage
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
The
cause
of
the
phenomenon
is
thus
explained
by
Mr.
Townley
:
"
The
colour
of
the
water
,
its
coming
down
to
the
place
where
it
breaks
forth
between
the
rock
and
the
earth
,
with
that
other
particular
of
its
bringing
nothing
along
but
stones
and
earth
,
are
evident
signs
that
it
hath
not
its
origin
from
the
very
bowels
of
the
mountain
;
but
that
it
is
only
rain
water
coloured
first
in
the
moss
-
pits
,
of
which
the
top
of
the
hill
,
being
a
great
and
considerable
plain
,
is
full
,
shrunk
down
into
some
receptacle
fit
to
contain
it
,
until
at
last
by
its
weight
,
or
some
other
cause
,
it
finds
a
passage
to
the
sides
of
the
hill
,
and
then
away
between
the
rock
and
swarth
,
until
it
break
the
latter
and
violently
rush
out
.

This
speech
is
in
substance
the
monarch
's
actual
Declaration
concerning
Lawful
Sports
,
promulgated
in
1618
,
in
a
little
Tractate
,
generally
known
as
the
"
Book
of
Sports
;
"
by
which
he
would
have
conferred
a
great
boon
on
the
lower
orders
,
if
his
kindly
purpose
had
not
been
misapprehended
by
some
,
and
ultimately
defeated
by
bigots
and
fanatics

King
James
deserves
to
be
remembered
with
gratitude
,
if
only
for
this
manifestation
of
sympathy
with
the
enjoyments
of
the
people
.

He
had
himself
discovered
that
the
restrictions
imposed
upon
them
had
"
setup
filthy
tipplings
and
drunkenness
,

bred
a
number
of
idle
and
discontented
speeches
in

alehouses

"
There
is
a
laughable
tradition
,
"
says
Nichols
,
"
still
generally
current
in
Lancashire
,
that
our
knight
-
making
monarch
knighted
at
the
banquet
in
Hoghton
Tower
a
loin
of
beef
;
the
part
ever
since
called
the
sir
-
loin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
is
added
by
the
same
authority
,
"
If
the
King
did
not
give
the
sir
-
loin
its
name
,
he
might
,
notwithstanding
,
have
indulged
in
a
pun
on
the
already
coined
word
,
the
etymology
of
which
was
then
,
as
now
,
as
little
regarded
as
the
thing
signified
is
well
approved
.
