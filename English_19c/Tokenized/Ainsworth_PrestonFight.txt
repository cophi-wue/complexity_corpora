THE
EARL
OF
DERWENTWATERCHAPTER
IDilston
<EOS>
CastleA
<EOS>
SPLENDID
place
was
Dilston
Castle
in
Northumberland
,
the
seat
of
the
young
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
in
the
early
part
of
the
last
century
.
<EOS>
Crowning
an
eminence
,
overlooking
a
most
picturesque
district
,
approached
by
a
long
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
,
and
surrounded
by
woods
,
extending
to
the
banks
of
the
Tyne
,
the
mansion
formed
a
conspicuous
object
from
whichever
side
it
might
be
viewed
.
<EOS>
Dilston
Castle
could
not
boast
antiquity
,
having
only
been
built
some
sixty
years
prior
to
the
date
of
our
story
,
by
Sir
James
Radclyffe
,
subsequently
created
Earl
of
Derwentwater
by
James
the
Second
,
but
it
occupied
the
site
of
an
old
Border
fortress
,
called
Devilstone
—
since
modified
to
Dilston
—
that
had
often
resisted
the
incursions
of
the
Scots
.
<EOS>
Of
this
stronghold
,
which
dated
back
to
the
time
of
Henry
the
First
,
only
a
single
memorial
was
left
,
in
the
shape
of
a
grey
stone
tower
—
all
the
rest
having
been
demolished
.
<EOS>
The
mansion
formed
a
square
,
and
enclosed
a
spacious
court
with
a
fountain
in
the
centre
.
<EOS>
The
principal
entrance
,
approached
by
a
large
perron
,
was
inside
the
court
,
and
faced
a
grand
gateway
,
that
terminated
the
chestnut
avenue
.
<EOS>
Close
by
,
though
screened
by
trees
,
was
a
little
chapel
,
wherein
the
rites
of
Rome
were
performed
—
the
Radclyffes
being
strict
adherents
to
the
old
religion
.
<EOS>
Hereabouts
,
also
,
stood
the
grey
stone
tower
,
before
alluded
to
,
and
some
chambers
within
it
were
still
used
.
<EOS>
As
may
be
supposed
,
from
its
size
,
the
mansion
contained
some
magnificent
apartments
,
and
these
were
sumptuously
furnished
.
<EOS>
Large
gardens
,
laid
out
in
the
formal
French
style
,
and
ornamented
with
terraces
,
flights
of
stone
steps
,
statues
,
and
fountains
,
added
to
the
attractions
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Beneath
the
acclivity
,
whereon
stood
the
castle
,
was
a
romantic
and
beautiful
dell
,
the
sides
of
which
were
clothed
with
brushwood
.
<EOS>
Through
the
midst
of
the
ravine
rushed
a
stream
,
called
the
Devil
's
Water
—
bright
and
clear
,
despite
its
name
—
that
hurried
on
,
unless
checked
by
a
huge
rock
,
or
some
other
impediment
,
when
it
spread
out
into
a
pool
.
<EOS>
In
places
,
the
glen
had
a
weird
look
,
and
many
strange
legends
were
connected
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
picturesque
beauty
of
the
spot
was
materially
heightened
by
a
lofty
bridge
flung
across
the
hollow
,
and
leading
from
the
castle
to
the
deer
-
park
.
<EOS>
From
this
bridge
,
the
stately
structure
,
with
the
charming
and
diversified
scenery
around
it
,
could
be
contemplated
to
the
greatest
advantage
.
<EOS>
The
park
boasted
many
ancient
oaks
and
ash
-
trees
,
and
was
well
stocked
with
deer
;
the
neighbouring
moors
abounded
with
grouse
,
the
smaller
streams
with
trout
,
and
the
Tyne
with
salmon
.
<EOS>
Better
shooting
and
fishing
could
not
be
had
than
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
The
noble
owner
of
this
proud
mansion
,
and
the
extensive
domains
attached
to
it
,
had
succeeded
to
the
title
and
estates
on
the
death
of
his
father
,
the
second
earl
,
some
five
years
previously
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
Dilston
,
Langley
Castle
,
and
Simonburn
in
Northumberland
,
he
had
large
estates
in
Cumberland
,
and
one
side
of
the
lovely
lake
of
Derwentwater
,
from
which
he
derived
his
title
,
belonged
to
him
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
lead
mines
at
Alston
Moor
that
produced
a
very
large
revenue
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
immense
wealth
and
importance
in
the
county
,
the
young
earl
led
a
very
retired
life
.
<EOS>
As
a
Roman
Catholic
,
he
laboured
under
disabilities
that
prevented
him
from
taking
part
in
public
affairs
.
<EOS>
But
he
maintained
a
numerous
establishment
,
and
was
extremely
hospitable
,
and
his
chaplain
and
almoner
,
Father
Norman
,
distributed
a
tithe
of
his
large
income
in
charity
.
<EOS>
Loyal
to
the
sovereign
he
recognised
,
firm
in
the
faith
he
professed
,
devout
,
charitable
,
courteous
,
courageous
—
<EOS>
such
was
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
at
twenty-
two
,
when
we
first
meet
him
.
<EOS>
The
young
earl
's
personal
appearance
was
extremely
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
Tall
,
and
well
-
proportioned
,
he
had
finely
-
formed
features
,
with
blue
eyes
and
fair
locks
.
<EOS>
He
was
fond
of
all
manly
exercises
,
a
daring
horseman
,
a
master
of
fence
,
and
a
good
shot
.
<EOS>
Several
important
alliances
had
been
proposed
to
him
,
but
he
was
still
unmarried
.
<EOS>
Charles
Radclyffe
,
his
only
brother
,
and
his
junior
by
a
year
and
a
half
,
resided
with
him
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
personal
resemblance
between
them
.
<EOS>
Like
his
brother
,
Charles
Radclyffe
was
an
enthusiastic
Jacobite
,
and
ready
to
run
any
risk
for
the
restoration
of
the
Stuarts
.
<EOS>
Viscount
Radclyffe
and
Langley
,
as
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
was
styled
in
his
father
's
lifetime
,
had
been
brought
up
at
the
court
of
the
exiled
monarch
,
James
the
Second
,
at
Saint
Germains
,
as
a
companion
to
the
young
prince
,
James
Edward
,
who
was
about
his
own
age
,
and
to
whom
he
was
nearly
allied
by
consanguinity
—
Lord
Radclyffe
's
mother
being
a
natural
daughter
of
Charles
the
Second
,
Constantly
together
,
and
sharing
the
same
studies
and
the
same
sports
,
the
cousins
,
as
they
were
called
,
became
greatly
attached
to
each
other
,
and
no
change
had
taken
place
in
their
sentiments
when
James
the
Second
breathed
his
last
,
dying
,
as
those
in
attendance
on
him
avouched
,
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
.
<EOS>
By
the
express
desire
of
Queen
Mary
of
Modena
,
Lord
Radclyffe
remained
at
Saint
Germains
until
after
the
death
of
William
the
Third
,
and
the
accession
of
Anne
,
mixed
up
in
the
various
Jacobite
plots
,
of
which
that
court
was
then
the
hot
-
bed
,
until
the
decease
of
his
own
father
,
in
1705
,
compelled
him
to
return
to
England
,
in
order
to
take
possession
of
his
estates
.
<EOS>
On
his
departure
the
young
earl
renewed
his
professions
of
loyalty
and
devotion
to
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
as
the
prince
was
now
designated
,
and
promised
to
hold
himself
in
constant
readiness
for
a
summons
to
rise
.
<EOS>
He
also
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
the
queen
,
who
embraced
him
like
a
mother
,
and
gave
him
her
blessing
.
<EOS>
Five
years
flew
by
,
during
which
an
attempt
at
invasion
was
made
by
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
with
a
squadron
under
the
command
of
the
renowned
Forbin
,
but
the
prince
was
unable
to
disembark
,
and
consequently
Lord
Derwentwater
was
not
called
upon
to
join
him
.
<EOS>
Discouraged
by
this
ill
-
success
,
and
receiving
no
further
support
from
Louis
the
Fourteenth
,
the
prince
joined
the
French
army
under
Villars
,
and
fought
bravely
at
Malplaquet
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
his
return
from
Saint
Germains
Lord
Derwentwater
had
resided
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
He
lacked
a
mother
's
care
,
for
the
countess
had
long
been
dead
,
but
he
was
watched
over
and
counselled
by
Father
Norman
,
an
excellent
man
,
who
had
been
chaplain
to
the
late
earl
.
<EOS>
In
anticipation
of
a
sudden
summons
,
Lord
Derwentwater
kept
a
large
collection
of
arms
concealed
in
the
old
tower
previously
described
.
<EOS>
He
had
plenty
of
horses
in
his
stables
and
elsewhere
,
and
with
his
servants
and
retainers
,
and
the
number
of
miners
in
his
employ
,
he
could
at
any
time
raise
two
or
three
hundred
men
,
and
arm
and
equip
them
.
<EOS>
Until
lately
,
a
secret
correspondence
had
been
constantly
kept
up
between
the
earl
and
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
but
for
some
months
no
letter
had
been
received
from
the
prince
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIThe
Chevalier
de
Saint
GeorgeONE
morning
,
at
this
juncture
,
the
young
earl
,
mounted
on
his
favourite
dapple-
grey
steed
,
rode
out
from
the
castle
,
and
took
his
way
down
the
chestnut
avenue
,
accompanied
by
his
brother
,
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
The
two
young
equestrians
made
a
very
gallant
appearance
,
being
attired
in
scarlet
riding
-
coats
,
edged
with
gold
lace
,
feathered
hats
,
long
neck
-
cloths
,
laced
ruffles
,
and
boots
ascending
above
the
knee
.
<EOS>
The
grooms
wore
<EOS>
green
riding-
coats
laced
with
gold
,
and
green
velvet
caps
.
<EOS>
The
earl
,
who
was
riding
to
Corbridge
,
which
was
not
very
far
off
,
proceeded
at
a
leisurely
pace
,
and
occasionally
halted
to
examine
some
object
in
the
grounds
,
or
listen
to
an
appeal
to
his
charity
.
<EOS>
In
the
latter
case
the
applicant
was
sent
on
to
the
castle
to
state
his
case
to
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
bright
and
clear
,
and
the
country
looked
so
charming
that
the
earl
determined
to
extend
his
ride
along
the
banks
of
the
Tyne
as
soon
as
his
business
at
Corbridge
was
finished
;
but
he
had
not
quitted
the
avenue
when
a
horseman
entered
it
,
who
was
evidently
proceeding
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
This
person
might
be
a
courier
,
for
he
rode
a
post
-
horse
,
and
was
followed
by
a
post
-
boy
,
who
carried
his
portmanteau
;
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
grey
riding
-
dress
to
indicate
rank
.
<EOS>
He
had
pistols
in
his
girdle
,
and
a
hanger
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
But
he
rode
well
,
though
provided
only
with
a
sorry
hack
,
and
had
a
military
bearing
.
<EOS>
In
age
he
could
not
be
more
than
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
if
so
much
.
<EOS>
He
was
rather
above
the
middle
height
,
and
slightly
built
,
and
his
features
were
handsome
and
expressive
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
earl
and
his
brother
the
stranger
immediately
slackened
his
pace
,
and
rode
slowly
towards
them
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
,
and
as
if
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
turned
to
his
brother
and
exclaimed:"By
Heaven
,
'
tis
<EOS>
he!""He
!
<EOS>
who
?
"
cried
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
under
his
breath
.
"Impossible
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
He
would
never
come
here
in
this
manner
,
and
without
giving
us
some
notice
of
his
design
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
the
prince
,
I
repeat
,
"
cried
Derwentwater
;
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
But
the
greatest
caution
must
be
observed
,
or
the
post
-
boy
's
suspicions
may
be
aroused
.
<EOS>
"Next
<EOS>
moment
the
stranger
came
up
,
and
respectfully
saluting
the
earl
,
told
him
he
was
the
bearer
of
an
important
despatch
,
whereupon
Lord
Derwentwater
invited
him
to
the
castle
,
and
turning
round
,
proceeded
in
that
direction
,
keeping
the
supposed
courier
near
him
,
while
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
had
now
recognised
the
stranger
from
his
likeness
to
the
portraits
of
the
prince
,
rode
at
a
little
distance
behind
them
.
<EOS>
The
meeting
was
so
cleverly
managed
that
the
grooms
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
it
,
and
the
post
-
boy
was
completely
duped
.
<EOS>
"I
never
had
a
harder
task
than
to
repress
my
delight
at
beholding
your
majesty
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
indeed
taken
me
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
""Had
<EOS>
it
been
possible
I
would
have
given
you
some
intimation
of
my
arrival
and
intended
visit
to
you
,
"
replied
the
prince
,
"
but
I
only
landed
at
Sunderland
yesterday
,
and
came
on
betimes
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Do
not
imagine
I
am
come
to
summon
you
to
arms
,
though
my
partisans
in
Scotland
are
ready
to
rise
,
and
would
at
once
join
my
standard
were
I
to
display
it
.
<EOS>
No
,
cousin
,
my
errand
is
pacific
.
<EOS>
""Pacific
!
"
exclaimed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
purpose
is
to
obtain
an
interview
with
my
sister
,
Queen
Anne
;
and
if
I
succeed
,
I
believe
no
insurrection
will
be
necessary
,
for
I
am
persuaded
she
will
agree
to
appoint
me
her
successor
.
<EOS>
You
must
accompany
me
to
London
,
cousin
.
<EOS>
""I
will
do
whatever
your
majesty
enjoins
,
"
replied
Lord
Derwentwater
,
greatly
astonished
by
what
he
heard
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
you
will
run
great
risk
,
while
I
very
much
fear
you
will
not
accomplish
your
object
.
<EOS>
Did
you
consult
the
queen
,
your
mother
,
before
setting
out
on
this
expedition?""I
did
,
cousin
,
and
must
frankly
own
that
she
endeavoured
to
dissuade
me
from
the
attempt
,
for
,
as
you
are
aware
,
her
majesty
deems
Anne
an
unnatural
daughter
,
and
destitute
of
all
feeling
for
the
brother
whose
throne
she
has
usurped
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
cold
as
she
is
,
Anne
can
not
be
insensible
to
the
king
,
our
father
's
,
dying
message
,
which
I
propose
to
deliver
to
her
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
will
move
her
,
sire
,
depend
upon
it
,
"
said
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Queen
Anne
is
so
strongly
opposed
to
the
Roman
Catholic
religion
,
that
unless
your
majesty
will
consent
to
change
your
faith
she
will
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
your
entreaties
.
<EOS>
""We
shall
see
,
"
replied
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
.
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
I
shall
have
an
answer
from
her
own
lips
,
and
shall
then
know
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
just
told
you
,
the
queen
,
my
mother
,
strove
to
combat
my
determination
,
but
,
finding
I
was
not
to
be
shaken
,
she
entreated
me
to
take
you
with
me
.
<EOS>
To
this
I
readily
agreed
,
as
I
knew
I
could
rely
on
your
devotion
.
<EOS>
I
embarked
at
Dunkerque
without
a
single
attendant
,
and
in
this
disguise
,
and
landed
yesterday
at
Sunderland
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
right
glad
I
am
to
welcome
your
majesty
to
Dilston
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
let
me
implore
you
to
change
your
plans
,
and
instead
of
supplicating
Queen
Anne
for
the
crown
,
that
of
right
belongs
to
yourself
,
snatch
it
from
her
brow
!
<EOS>
Should
you
decide
thus
—
and
I
believe
it
will
be
for
the
best
—
I
will
undertake
,
within
a
week
,
to
raise
a
large
force
—
while
thousands
will
flock
to
your
standard
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Your
majesty
will
do
well
to
weigh
my
proposal
,
ere
setting
out
on
a
hazardous
expedition
to
London
.
<EOS>
Here
you
have
a
mansion
you
can
call
your
own
—
servants
you
can
command
—
friends
at
your
disposal
—
and
in
a
few
days
you
will
have
an
army
.
<EOS>
Be
advised
by
me
,
my
gracious
liege
,
and
abandon
this
wild
scheme
.
<EOS>
Suffer
me
to
get
together
your
adherents
.
<EOS>
Let
me
send
off
messengers
without
delay
to
Lord
Widdrington
,
Tom
Errington
,
of
Beaufront
,
John
Shaftoe
,
Swinbourn
,
Charleton
,
Clavering
,
and
others
in
the
county
,
to
collect
all
their
retainers
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
they
are
unprepared
,
"
remarked
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"Pardon
<EOS>
me
,
my
liege
.
<EOS>
The
friends
I
have
named
are
always
prepared
,
and
the
news
that
your
majesty
is
here
would
rouse
them
all
to
come
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
added
to
the
list
Jack
Hall
of
Otterburn
,
and
Tom
Forster
of
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
They
are
High
Church
Tories
,
and
will
bring
many
others
with
them
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
doubt
,
they
would
prove
an
important
acquisition
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
try
to
dethrone
Anne
till
I
have
given
her
the
chance
of
acting
fairly
towards
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sanguine
as
to
the
result
of
my
interview
with
her
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
grant
your
majesty
may
not
be
disappointed
!
"
rejoined
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
Whenever
it
shall
please
you
to
set
out
to
London
,
I
shall
be
ready
to
attend
you
.
<EOS>
""I
will
remain
here
till
to
-
morrow
,
cousin
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
On
some
future
occasion
I
hope
to
be
your
guest
for
a
longer
time
;
but
though
Dilston
is
a
charming
place
,
and
I
should
like
to
see
all
its
beauties
,
it
must
not
detain
me
now
.
<EOS>
"They
were
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
,
but
<EOS>
,
before
passing
through
the
gateway
,
Lord
Derwentwater
said
to
the
prince:"Your
majesty
had
best
dismount
here
,
and
get
rid
of
the
post
-
boy
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
this
the
prince
sprang
from
his
horse
,
while
the
gate
-
porter
by
the
earl
's
directions
paid
the
post
-
boy
,
and
took
the
portmanteau
from
him
.
<EOS>
Having
received
a
handsome
gratuity
for
himself
,
the
man
then
departed
with
his
horses
in
tolerably
good
humour
;
though
,
aware
of
the
earl
's
hospitality
,
he
had
hoped
to
be
regaled
in
the
servants
'
hall
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Lord
Derwentwater
and
his
brother
having
alighted
,
the
party
walked
across
the
great
quadrangular
court
—
the
prince
pausing
occasionally
to
look
around
,
and
express
his
admiration
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
my
faith
!
<EOS>
cousin
,
you
have
a
splendid
house
,
"
he
cried
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
quite
a
palace
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
not
take
possession
of
it
,
my
liege
?
"
replied
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"You
tempt
me
greatly
.
<EOS>
But
no
!
<EOS>
I
must
not
be
diverted
from
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
"They
<EOS>
then
ascended
the
magnificent
flight
of
stone
steps
,
and
entered
a
spacious
hall
—
the
door
being
thrown
open
by
a
butler
and
several
other
servants
in
the
earl
's
rich
livery
.
<EOS>
"Little
<EOS>
did
I
dream
,
when
I
set
forth
an
hour
ago
,
whom
I
should
bring
back
as
my
guest
,
"
observed
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"You
have
often
told
me
at
Saint
Germains
how
rejoiced
you
would
be
to
see
me
here
,
"
rejoined
the
prince
;
"
and
now
you
perceive
I
have
taken
you
at
your
word
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
very
remiss
,
cousin
—
pray
present
your
brother
to
me!"The
presentation
then
took
place
,
but
without
any
ceremony
,
on
account
of
the
servants
,
and
the
prince
shook
hands
very
heartily
with
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
an
elderly
personage
,
with
silver
locks
,
that
fell
over
his
shoulders
,
and
wearing
a
priestly
garb
,
entered
the
hall
.
<EOS>
It
was
Father
Norman
,
who
had
come
to
see
whom
the
earl
had
brought
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
good
priest
had
a
kindly
and
benevolent
expression
of
countenance
,
and
fixed
his
keen
grey
eyes
inquiringly
on
the
stranger
,
with
whose
appearance
he
was
greatly
struck
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
'
scrutiny
he
consulted
Lord
Derwentwater
by
a
look
,
and
his
suspicions
being
confirmed
,
he
most
respectfully
returned
the
reverence
made
to
him
by
the
prince
.
<EOS>
Having
given
some
orders
to
the
butler
,
Lord
Derwentwater
conducted
his
guest
to
the
library
which
opened
from
the
hall
,
and
they
were
followed
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Further
disguise
was
now
unnecessary
,
and
no
inquisitive
observer
being
present
,
the
prince
was
treated
by
all
with
the
respect
that
was
his
due
.
<EOS>
The
impression
of
the
priest
and
Charles
Radclyffe
was
that
he
was
come
to
prepare
a
rising
,
and
when
they
learnt
his
real
design
they
could
scarcely
conceal
their
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
,
however
,
ventured
to
offer
a
remonstrance
,
till
Father
Norman
,
being
urged
by
the
prince
to
speak
out
<EOS>
,
said:"I
fear
your
majesty
will
find
the
queen
impracticable
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
has
already
named
the
Elector
of
Hanover
her
successor
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
she
may
change
her
mind
,
good
father
.
<EOS>
""Her
<EOS>
ministers
will
not
allow
her
to
do
so
,
my
liege
.
<EOS>
They
are
resolved
upon
a
Protestant
succession
—
and
so
is
she
.
<EOS>
Renounce
your
religion
,
and
you
will
succeed
—
not
otherwise
.
<EOS>
""I
have
already
said
as
much
to
his
majesty
,
"
observed
Lord
Derwentwater
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
entertains
a
better
opinion
of
the
queen
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
""I
am
unwilling
to
believe
that
she
will
disregard
her
father
's
dying
injunctions
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
Bear
in
mind
that
she
has
never
seen
me
.
<EOS>
When
we
meet
the
voice
of
natural
affection
will
make
itself
heard
.
<EOS>
She
will
then
become
sensible
of
the
great
wrong
she
has
done
me
,
and
hasten
to
make
atonement
.
<EOS>
She
will
feel
that
by
her
wicked
and
unnatural
conduct
she
has
incurred
Heaven
's
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Her
own
children
have
been
taken
from
her
.
<EOS>
Other
severe
chastisements
may
follow
,
if
not
averted
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
arguments
I
shall
employ
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
they
will
fail
in
effect
,
my
liege
,
because
her
heart
is
hardened
,
and
she
is
blind
to
her
sinfulness
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
rather
sacrifice
her
brother
than
help
to
re
-
establish
our
religion
.
<EOS>
""Trust
me
<EOS>
,
my
liege
,
Father
Norman
has
formed
a
just
estimate
of
the
queen
's
character
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
vain
to
appeal
to
good
feelings
,
where
none
exist
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
she
is
so
utterly
devoid
of
natural
affection
as
her
conduct
would
seem
to
bespeak
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
judge
from
what
I
am
about
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
solicited
a
private
interview
with
her
in
Saint
James
's
Palace
,
and
she
has
granted
my
request
.
<EOS>
""Granted
it
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Lord
Derwentwater
in
astonishment
,
that
was
shared
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
replied
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
My
letter
was
conveyed
by
a
faithful
friend
,
and
the
answer
to
it
was
that
her
majesty
would
see
me
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
all
I
asked
.
<EOS>
She
felt
compunction
for
her
ill
-
doing
,
or
she
would
have
refused
my
request
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
will
you
obtain
admittance
to
her
,
my
liege
?
"
asked
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"Easily
,
"
replied
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Mar
will
usher
me
into
her
presence
.
<EOS>
""This
certainly
seems
favourable
,
and
alters
my
view
of
the
matter
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Yet
it
may
be
a
device
of
Harley
to
ensnare
your
majesty
.
<EOS>
Are
you
certain
that
your
letter
reached
the
queen?""My
emissary
would
not
deceive
me
,
"
replied
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
as
loyal
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
may
speak
plainly
to
your
majesty
,
"
remarked
Charles
Radclyffe
,
"
I
would
say
that
I
have
still
great
doubts
.
<EOS>
The
queen
may
delude
you
with
false
hopes
,
to
keep
you
quiet
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
she
will
keep
her
promise
if
she
makes
it
.
<EOS>
Of
that
I
am
convinced
,
"
said
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
butler
entered
to
say
that
luncheon
was
served
,
upon
which
the
earl
conducted
his
guest
to
the
dining
-
room
,
where
a
very
substantial
repast
awaited
them
.
<EOS>
The
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
had
not
breakfasted
,
and
his
early
morning
's
ride
having
given
him
a
good
appetite
,
he
did
ample
justice
to
the
broiled
trout
from
the
Devil
's
Water
,
and
the
cutlets
of
Tyne
salmon
set
before
him
.
<EOS>
As
the
servants
were
present
during
the
repast
,
he
was
treated
merely
as
an
ordinary
visitor
,
and
the
conversation
between
him
and
the
earl
was
conducted
entirely
in
French
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
excited
the
suspicion
of
Mr.
Newbiggin
,
the
butler
,
who
from
the
first
had
been
struck
by
the
stranger
's
appearance
and
manner
,
and
he
soon
became
convinced
that
Mr.
Johnson
,
as
the
prince
was
called
,
was
a
very
important
personage
.
<EOS>
On
quitting
the
dining
-
room
,
the
butler
found
the
earl
's
chief
valet
in
the
entrance
-
hall
,
and
said
to
him:"I
ca
n't
make
out
this
Mr.
Johnson
,
Thirlwall
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
<EOS>
him?""I'm
puzzled
,
I
own
,
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
He
seems
to
me
like
a
Frenchman
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
more
a
Frenchman
than
his
lordship
is
,
Thirlwall
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
n't
wonder
,
"
said
the
butler
,
knowingly
,
"
if
he
has
been
brought
up
at
a
French
court
.
<EOS>
""At
<EOS>
the
Court
of
Saint
Germains
?
"
cried
Thirlwall
.
<EOS>
"Precisely
,
"
said
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
you
seem
to
insinuate
that
it
's
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
in
person
,
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
""I've
<EOS>
my
own
idea
on
that
point
,
Thirlwall
,
"
said
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
should
turn
out
as
I
suspect
,
we
're
on
the
eve
of
an
insurrection
.
<EOS>
The
prince
would
n't
come
here
on
a
trifling
errand
.
<EOS>
But
keep
quiet
for
the
present
—
this
is
mere
conjecture
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
butler
then
returned
to
the
dining
-
room
,
while
Mr.
Thirlwall
hurried
to
the
servants
'
hall
,
where
he
retailed
all
he
had
just
heard
,
with
some
additions
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
half
an
hour
it
was
known
among
the
whole
household
that
his
majesty
,
King
James
the
Third
,
had
arrived
,
in
disguise
,
at
the
castle
.

CHAPTER
IIINicholas
RibbletonIF
<EOS>
any
confirmation
were
wanted
of
the
suspicions
now
generally
entertained
by
Mr.
Newbiggin
and
the
rest
of
the
servants
that
a
rising
was
imminent
,
it
was
afforded
by
the
earl
,
who
took
his
guest
,
as
soon
as
luncheon
was
over
,
to
see
the
arms
stored
in
the
old
tower
.
<EOS>
The
inspection
occupied
some
time
,
for
three
or
four
chambers
had
to
be
visited
,
each
full
of
muskets
,
calivers
,
pistols
,
cartouche
-
boxes
,
powder-
horns
,
shot
-
bags
,
belts
,
swords
of
various
sizes

hatchets

pikes

halberts

black
leather
caps
,
drums
,
kettle
-
drums
,
trumpets
,
fifes
,
and
other
martial
instruments
.
<EOS>
In
a
vault
beneath
the
basement
floor
were
bestowed
several
barrels
of
gunpowder
.
<EOS>
When
the
examination
was
finished
the
prince
expressed
himself
delighted
with
the
preparations
made
.
<EOS>
"You
told
me
you
could
arm
and
equip
two
or
three
hundred
men
,
cousin
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
now
perceive
you
did
not
exaggerate
.
<EOS>
But
where
are
the
men?""I
have
but
to
ride
to
Alston
Moor
,
my
liege
,
to
find
them
,
and
bring
them
back
with
me
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"Men
<EOS>
and
arms
are
ready
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
raise
the
standard
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
lifting
up
the
flag
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
as
if
in
response
to
the
appeal
,
shouts
were
heard
outside
,
and
several
voices
exclaimed:"Long
live
King
James
<EOS>
the
Third!""Is
this
premeditated
,
cousin
?
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"No
,
by
my
faith
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
seems
your
majesty
's
presence
has
been
discovered
—
how
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
away
the
troublesome
varlets?""'Twere
needless
,
since
the
discovery
has
been
made
,
"
said
the
prince
,
who
did
not
seem
much
displeased
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
majesty
need
feel
no
uneasiness
,
"
observed
Father
Norman
,
who
formed
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
no
traitors
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
All
here
are
loyal
,
and
would
die
rather
than
betray
you
.
<EOS>
""On
that
assurance
<EOS>
I
shall
not
hesitate
to
show
myself
to
them
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
Attend
me
,
I
pray
you
,
cousin
.
"The
<EOS>
massive
door
being
thrown
open
,
a
singular
spectacle
was
seen
.
<EOS>
In
front
of
the
tower
was
collected
a
large
number
of
the
household
,
with
several
out
-
door
servants
—
grooms
,
game
-
keepers
,
huntsmen
,
gardeners
,
and
their
assistants
—
most
of
them
young
and
active
-
looking
,
though
the
coachman
was
old
and
stout
,
and
there
were
three
or
four
others
,
who
must
have
lived
in
the
family
for
half
a
century
.
<EOS>
But
these
were
just
as
enthusiastic
as
their
comrades
.
<EOS>
When
the
prince
appeared
another
loud
shout
arose
,
and
would
have
been
renewed
had
not
the
earl
commanded
silence
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
thank
you
heartily
,
my
good
friends
,
for
this
manifestation
of
your
zeal
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
imagine
,
because
I
have
come
hither
in
disguise
,
that
I
am
afraid
to
trust
myself
with
you
,
or
,
in
the
slightest
degree
,
doubt
your
fidelity
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
your
master
,
is
my
best
friend
,
and
dear
to
me
as
a
brother
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
live
with
him
without
sharing
his
sentiments
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
therefore
,
have
any
distrust
.
<EOS>
But
I
feared
that
in
the
excess
of
your
zeal
you
might
not
keep
guard
upon
your
tongues
,
and
I
am
very
desirous
that
my
landing
in
England
,
and
arrival
at
Dilston
,
should
not
be
known
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Secrecy
,
as
you
will
easily
understand
,
is
essential
to
the
success
of
my
projects
.
<EOS>
"A
murmur
of
delight
arose
from
the
assemblage
,
but
further
shouting
was
checked
by
Newbiggin
,
who
,
stepping
forward
,
made
a
profound
obeisance
to
the
prince
,
and
said:"Your
majesty
need
fear
no
indiscretion
on
our
part
.
<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
my
fellow
-
servants
.
<EOS>
We
know
the
importance
of
our
trust
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
that
we
do
,
"
cried
several
voices
.
<EOS>
"I
am
perfectly
satisfied
,
"
said
the
prince
;
"
and
I
shall
feel
easier
now
that
this
explanation
has
taken
place
.
<EOS>
Again
accept
my
thanks
for
your
manifestation
of
sympathy
and
attachment
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
speak
to
you
all
,
but
there
is
one
among
you
to
whom
I
would
fain
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
designated
a
tall
,
fine
old
man
,
standing
at
the
back
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
"That
is
Nicholas
Ribbleton
,
my
liege
,
"
said
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
lived
with
his
lordship
's
grandfather
.
<EOS>
""And
was
much
liked
by
him
,
and
by
my
father
,
"
added
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Nicholas
Ribbleton
will
always
have
a
home
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
""Bring
him
to
me
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
Summoned
by
the
butler
,
old
Ribbleton
would
have
thrown
himself
at
the
prince
's
feet
,
but
the
latter
prevented
him
,
and
gave
him
his
hand
,
which
the
old
man
pressed
devotedly
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"I
never
expected
such
an
honour
as
this
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Your
majesty
is
too
gracious
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
been
devoted
to
your
royal
house
,
and
shall
continue
so
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
It
may
sound
boastful
when
I
say
that
both
King
Charles
the
Second
,
and
your
august
father
,
King
James
,
deigned
to
notice
me
.
<EOS>
Long
have
I
desired
to
behold
your
majesty
,
and
now
the
wish
is
gratified
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
emotion
choked
his
utterance
for
a
moment
,
but
he
added
,
"
If
I
live
to
see
your
majesty
on
the
throne
I
shall
die
content
.
<EOS>
Long
have
we
looked
for
your
coming
,
but
now
you
are
come
,
do
n't
turn
back
till
you
have
won
the
victory
.
<EOS>
You
have
right
on
your
side
.
<EOS>
The
crown
belongs
to
your
majesty
,
and
not
to
Queen
Anne
.
<EOS>
If
she
wo
n't
surrender
it
,
take
it
!
<EOS>
Such
is
the
advice
that
an
old
man
,
who
has
spoken
to
the
king
your
father
,
and
your
royal
uncle
,
dares
to
give
you
.
<EOS>
Pardon
my
freedom
,
sire!""I
not
only
pardon
it
,
but
am
obliged
to
you
for
speaking
so
freely
,
"
replied
the
prince
,
in
a
gracious
and
encouraging
tone
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
say
if
Queen
Anne
should
surrender
the
crown
to
me?""I
shall
say
that
a
miracle
has
been
worked
,
"
said
Ribbleton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
judging
by
her
conduct
,
it
seems
very
unlikely
that
she
will
act
justly
.
<EOS>
Were
I
your
majesty
,
I
would
n't
trust
her
promises
,
however
fair
they
may
be
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
art
too
bold
,
Ribbleton
<EOS>
,
"
interposed
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
I
am
not
offended
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
wisdom
in
the
old
man
's
words
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
some
further
talk
with
you
anon
,
my
good
friend
,
"
he
added
to
Ribbleton
,
who
made
an
obeisance
,
and
retired
highly
pleased
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
Newbiggin
gave
a
sign
to
the
rest
of
the
household
,
and
the
place
was
quickly
cleared
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVThe
Little
ChapelLORD
DERWENTWATER
then
took
his
royal
guest
to
the
stables
,
and
showed
him
his
fine
stud
of
horses
,
with
which
the
prince
was
greatly
pleased
.
<EOS>
After
looking
over
the
collection
,
his
highness
made
choice
of
a
strong
hackney
for
his
proposed
journey
.
<EOS>
The
earl
offered
him
his
own
dapple
-
grey
steed
,
but
the
prince
would
not
deprive
him
of
his
favourite
.
<EOS>
No
precise
orders
were
given
,
but
two
of
the
grooms
were
told
that
they
might
have
to
set
out
for
London
on
the
morrow
,
and
must
therefore
make
all
needful
arrangements
.
<EOS>
The
men
asked
no
questions
,
but
promised
that
his
lordship
's
injunctions
should
be
attended
to
.
<EOS>
Father
Norman
had
not
accompanied
the
party
to
the
stables
,
but
proceeded
to
the
little
chapel
before
alluded
to
,
where
he
was
joined
by
the
prince
,
and
received
his
highness
's
confession
.
<EOS>
Mass
was
afterwards
performed
,
at
which
most
of
the
household
assisted
—
several
of
the
female
servants
being
present
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pleasing
sight
to
see
the
little
place
of
worship
on
that
interesting
occasion
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
many
of
the
persons
there
assembled
thought
more
of
the
prince
than
of
their
devotions
,
but
their
behaviour
was
extremely
decorous
.
<EOS>
The
chapel
was
not
larger
than
an
ordinary
room
,
and
very
simply
furnished
.
<EOS>
In
a
small
oaken
pew
at
the
upper
end
,
on
the
right
of
the
altar
,
sat
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
—
almost
concealed
from
view
.
<EOS>
In
a
similar
pew
on
the
left
were
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
his
brother
.
<EOS>
On
wooden
benches
behind
were
collected
the
servants
—
the
women
sitting
by
themselves
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
Many
a
curious
eye
was
fixed
on
the
prince
whenever
he
arose
.
<EOS>
The
solemn
service
was
admirably
performed
by
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
Strange
thoughts
possessed
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
In
the
family
vault
beneath
the
chapel
lay
his
sire
and
grandsire
,
both
of
whom
had
been
devoted
to
the
Stuarts
.
<EOS>
Might
not
their
shades
be
hovering
around
?
<EOS>
Exceedingly
superstitious
,
the
earl
thought
so
,
and
so
did
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
The
congregation
had
dispersed
—
long
to
remember
the
event
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
the
chapel
,
the
prince
said
to
the
earl:"Are
not
some
of
your
family
buried
here
,
my
lord?""My
father
and
my
grandfather
,
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
aught
could
rouse
them
from
their
slumbers
it
would
be
your
majesty
's
presence
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
prince
remained
silent
for
a
moment
,
looking
very
grave
,
and
then
said:"You
will
scarce
credit
me
when
I
tell
you
that
I
saw
—
or
fancied
I
saw
—
two
figures
standing
between
me
and
the
altar
.
<EOS>
Their
mournful
looks
seemed
to
convey
a
warning
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
They
pointed
to
you
and
your
brother
,
and
then
disappeared
.
<EOS>
What
think
you
of
this
?
<EOS>
Were
they
phantoms?""I
know
not
what
to
think
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
No
such
appearances
have
ever
been
beheld
before
,
but
then
no
prince
of
your
royal
house
has
ever
before
knelt
within
this
chapel
.
<EOS>
We
will
consult
Father
Norman
anon
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
let
me
take
your
majesty
to
the
garden
.
<EOS>
You
must
banish
these
gloomy
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"A
stroll
through
the
charming
gardens
quickly
produced
the
desired
effect
.
<EOS>
As
yet
the
prince
had
seen
nothing
of
the
beauties
of
the
place
,
and
was
unacquainted
with
the
commanding
position
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
The
view
from
the
terrace
enchanted
him
,
and
he
remained
for
some
time
contemplating
the
lovely
scene
in
silence
,
and
then
broke
out
into
raptures
.
<EOS>
By
his
own
request
he
was
next
taken
to
the
deer
-
park
,
and
halted
on
the
bridge
to
look
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
It
has
already
been
mentioned
that
this
was
the
best
point
from
which
the
stately
structure
could
be
surveyed
,
and
the
prince
was
of
that
opinion
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
well
the
castle
looks
as
it
towers
above
us
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
what
a
striking
picture
it
makes
,
combined
with
this
deep
glen
,
the
rushing
stream
,
and
yonder
woods
,
with
the
Tyne
in
the
distance
!
<EOS>
You
could
not
have
a
nobler
residence
,
cousin
.
<EOS>
""Undoubtedly
,
my
liege
,
I
ought
to
be
content
with
it
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
;
"
and
so
I
am
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
should
prefer
the
old
stronghold
that
once
stood
there
,
and
of
which
you
have
just
seen
a
relic
;
and
had
it
not
been
demolished
by
my
grandfather
,
Earl
Francis
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
preserved
it
.
<EOS>
Imagine
how
well
the
stern
old
pile
must
have
looked
,
perched
on
that
height
,
and
how
completely
it
must
have
harmonised
with
this
ravine
,
and
with
the
woods
.
<EOS>
Its
position
and
strength
considered
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
Scottish
marauders
,
though
they
often
came
in
force
,
could
never
take
it
.
<EOS>
The
fortress
might
have
stood
a
siege
in
our
own
time
.
<EOS>
""Very
true
,
"
replied
the
prince
,
smiling
.
"
<EOS>
And
on
that
account
its
destruction
may
be
regretted
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
the
modern
building
is
most
to
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
could
desire
nothing
better
.
<EOS>
""I
trust
,
ere
long
,
Windsor
Castle
may
be
yours
,
my
liege
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
;
"
and
then
you
will
think
little
of
Dilston
.
<EOS>
""Dilston
can
not
vie
with
Windsor
,
that
is
certain
,
cousin
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
is
a
splendid
place
,
and
you
are
fortunate
in
possessing
it
.
<EOS>
The
mansion
only
wants
one
thing
to
make
it
perfect
.
<EOS>
You
can
guess
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
tell
you
plainly
.
<EOS>
A
lady
ought
to
grace
it
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
wait
till
your
majesty
is
restored
before
I
take
a
wife
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
wait
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
.
"
<EOS>
Has
no
fair
Northumbrian
damsel
caught
your
eye
?
<EOS>
I
am
told
Tom
Forster
's
sister
,
Dorothy
,
is
marvellously
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
may
not
be
rich
,
but
you
do
not
want
a
dower
.
<EOS>
""Dorothy
<EOS>
Forster
is
a
very
charming
girl
,
I
admit
,
and
has
many
agreeable
qualities
,
but
I
never
thought
seriously
of
her
.
<EOS>
""Strange
<EOS>
you
should
have
alluded
to
her
in
one
of
your
letters
to
me
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
majesty
reminds
me
that
I
compared
her
very
advantageously
with
her
brother
,
who
is
a
mere
country
squire
,
and
not
remarkable
for
wit
,
whereas
Dorothy
is
extremely
lively
and
clever
,
besides
being
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
n't
mean
to
intimate
that
I
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
gave
me
that
impression
,
I
confess
,
cousin
,
"
said
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
fully
expected
your
next
letter
would
tell
me
you
were
engaged
to
her
.
<EOS>
Is
she
very
young?""About
eighteen
,
<EOS>
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
""Just
<EOS>
the
age
.
<EOS>
And
she
rides
well
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
said?""Admirably
.
<EOS>
Tom
Forster
keeps
the
best
pack
of
hounds
in
the
county
,
and
she
goes
out
with
them
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
only
see
one
objection
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
does
not
belong
to
our
religion
.
<EOS>
""But
she
does
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Then
you
can
not
do
better
than
make
choice
of
her
.
<EOS>
""Even
<EOS>
if
I
were
to
take
your
majesty
's
advice
,
it
does
not
follow
I
should
be
accepted
.
<EOS>
""Bah
!
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
is
not
likely
to
be
refused
.
<EOS>
""Dorothy
<EOS>
Forster
will
we
d
no
one

does
not
love

<EOS>

we
d
her

""Have

point

majesty
is
pleased
to
rally
me

<EOS>
""I
want
an
answer
to
the
question

<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
an
interruption
to
their
discourse
was
offered
by
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
came
hurriedly
down
to
the
bridge
to
announce
that
some
visitors
had
arrived
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
"Newbiggin
<EOS>
could
n't
send
them
away
,
and
was
driven
to
his
wit
's
end
,
for
they
would
come
in
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
are
they
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Mr

<EOS>
Forster
of
Bamborough
,
and
his
sister
,
"
replied
Charles
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
lucky
chance
.
<EOS>
""It
would
have
mattered
little
if
they
had
been
alone

my
liege

said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
Sir
John
Webb
of
Canford
,
Lady
Webb
,
and
their
daughter
are
with
them
,
and
the
whole
party
evidently
intend
to
stay
here
till
to-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
and
Lady
Webb
have
brought
a
great
coach
with
them
and
a
pack
of
servants
,
but
the
two
girls
and
Tom
Forster
came
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
Forster
would
n't
hear
a
word
from
Newbiggin
,
but
told
him
he
was
sure
his
lordship
would
be
glad
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
so
I
should
,
under
other
circumstances
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Heed
me
not
<EOS>
,
"
cried
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
pleased
at
this
opportunity
of
meeting
Mr.
Forster
and
Sir
John
Webb
,
both
of
whom
I
know
are
my
warm
partisans
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
your
majesty
does
not
object
,
I
feel
quite
easy
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
visitors
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
to
his
brother
.
<EOS>
"I
left
them
on
the
lawn
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
them
you
had
a
friend
with
you
—
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
prepare
them
,
my
liege?""No
,
"
replied
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
choose
my
own
time
for
the
disclosure
.
<EOS>
""Haste
<EOS>
back
,
then
,
and
say
I
will
be
with
them
anon
,
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
be
careful
to
give
them
no
hint
.
<EOS>
""Your
majesty
may
rely
on
me
,
"
replied
Charles
,
as
he
bowed
and
departed
.
<EOS>
"This
is
our
North
Country
custom
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
We
visit
each
other
without
the
slightest
ceremony
—
take
friends
with
us
—
and
stay
as
long
as
we
please
.
<EOS>
In
coming
to
me
thus
,
uninvited
,
and
bringing
Sir
John
Webb
and
his
family
with
him
,
Tom
Forster
is
only
doing
what
I
should
not
hesitate
to
do
,
were
I
inclined
to
pay
him
a
visit
at
Bamborough
Castle
.
<EOS>
""I
am
very
glad
he
has
come
,
for
it
will
give
me
an
opportunity
of
beholding
the
fair
Dorothy
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"Your
majesty
will
also
behold
Anna
Webb
,
who
,
in
my
opinion
,
is
far
more
beautiful
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
have
seen
her
?
"
cried
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
saw
her
only
a
few
days
ago
at
Bamborough
,
and
admired
her
greatly
.
<EOS>
She
is
really
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
I
think
Tom
Forster
is
épris
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
Sir
John
Webb
is
returning
to
Dorsetshire
with
his
family
,
and
Tom
is
escorting
them
on
their
journey
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
we
shall
hear
of
an
engagement
by
-
and
-
bye
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
she
is
as
handsome
as
you
describe
her
,
Anna
Webb
ought
not
to
be
a
rude
fox
-
hunter
's
wife
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
But
come
!
<EOS>
let
us
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
two
beauties
.
<EOS>
You
have
roused
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
VAnna
Webb
and
Dorothy
ForsterHow
<EOS>
well
the
two
beauties
looked
in
their
gay
riding-
dresses
of
scarlet
and
blue
,
trimmed
with
gold
and
silver
lace
,
and
plumed
hats
!
<EOS>
Slight
and
graceful
in
figure
,
and
nearly
of
an
age
<EOS>
,
Anna
Webb
was
a
few
months
older
than
Dorothy
,
but
she
could
not
be
more
than
nineteen
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
had
cheeks
like
a
blush
-
rose
,
tender
blue
eyes
,
and
flaxen
tresses
,
with
features
that
could
not
be
called
regular
,
but
were
,
nevertheless
,
excessively
pretty
;
while
Anna
's
locks
were
of
a
raven
hue
,
her
eyes
large
,
black
,
and
lustrous
,
and
fringed
with
silken
lashes
,
her
tint
pale
,
yet
clear
,
and
her
face
classically
faultless
in
outline
.
<EOS>
If
the
palm
of
beauty
could
not
be
assigned
to
Dorothy
,
it
must
be
owned
that
she
had
a
more
agreeable
expression
than
Anna
,
whose
short
curling
upper
lip
gave
her
a
somewhat
disdainful
look
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
both
lovely
creatures
,
and
quite
enchanted
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
as
he
first
beheld
them
standing
near
a
marble
fountain
at
the
edge
of
the
large
,
smooth
-
shaven
lawn
near
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
Close
beside
them
was
Lady
Webb
—
a
fine
,
stately
,
middle
-
aged
dame
,
richly
dressed
in
damask
,
and
having
a
hoop
-
petticoat
,
long
stiff
bodice
,
and
a
lofty
head
-
dress
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
few
patches
on
her
face
,
and
a
large
fan
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Lady
Webb
had
a
haughty
manner
,
and
did
not
forget
that
she
came
of
a
noble
family
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Webb
,
who
paid
great
deference
to
his
lady
,
was
about
sixty
,
and
had
a
marked
countenance
,
dark
eyes
,
and
a
large
aquiline
nose
.
<EOS>
His
bearing
was
soldierlike
,
which
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
since
he
had
served
under
James
the
Second
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
nothing
military
in
his
attire
,
which
consisted
of
a
square
-
cut
,
claret
-
coloured
coat
,
richly
embroidered
with
lace
,
and
laced
waistcoat
with
long
flaps
,
cream
-
coloured
silk
stockings
,
shoes
with
high
red
heels
,
a
long
neckcloth
bordered
with
Brussels
lace
,
lace
ruffles
at
his
wrist
,
a
sword
by
his
side
,
and
a
well
-
powdered
periwig
on
his
head
,
surmounted
by
a
small
three
-
cornered
hat
.
<EOS>
He
carried
a
gold
-
headed
clouded
cane
in
his
hand
,
and
occasionally
produced
a
very
handsome
gold
snuff
-
box
.
<EOS>
The
Webbs
were
strict
Roman
Catholics
,
and
devoted
to
the
house
of
Stuart
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Sir
John
had
followed
the
exiled
monarch
for
a
short
time
to
Saint
Germains
.
<EOS>
Tom
Forster
,
who
was
talking
to
him
,
and
pointing
out
the
beauties
of
the
place
with
his
riding
-
whip
,
looked
exactly
like
what
he
was
—
a
country
squire
,
who
rode
hard
,
lived
well
,
and
drank
hard
.
<EOS>
In
age
,
he
could
not
be
more
than
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
would
have
been
considered
very
good
-
looking
if
the
hue
of
his
skin
had
not
been
somewhat
too
florid
.
<EOS>
Decidedly
,
he
was
like
his
sister
,
if
a
rather
coarse
man
can
be
said
to
resemble
a
delicate
girl
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
better
horses
than
Tom
Forster
—
not
even
Lord
Derwentwater
—
no
one
had
better
claret
,
and
you
might
have
plenty
of
it
—
perhaps
,
rather
too
much
.
<EOS>
Tom
Forster
kept
a
pack
of
fox
-
hounds
,
and
hunted
regularly
;
and
as
he
was
hospitable
,
jovial
,
and
good
-
humoured
,
he
was
exceedingly
popular
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
constantly
rode
to
hounds
,
and
was
greatly
admired
for
courage
and
skill
,
for
she
often
gained
the
brush
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
we
have
endeavoured
to
show
,
there
was
nothing
masculine
about
her
—
nothing
that
could
be
objected
to
in
her
liveliness
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
her
presence
operated
as
a
restraint
upon
her
brother
's
guests
,
and
kept
them
within
bounds
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Webb
and
his
family
had
been
staying
for
some
little
time
at
Bamborough
Castle
,
and
had
been
delighted
with
the
ancient
structure
,
which
,
whether
from
its
situation
on
a
lofty
and
almost
perpendicular
rock
,
overlooking
the
Northern
Ocean
,
or
from
its
well
-
preserved
walls
and
square
massive
keep
,
may
be
justly
considered
one
of
the
grandest
castles
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Another
opportunity
may
occur
for
describing
it
more
fully
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
we
may
say
that
Anna
Webb
,
who
was
of
a
somewhat
romantic
turn
,
had
been
especially
delighted
with
the
place
.
<EOS>
She
remained
for
hours
upon
the
ramparts
gazing
upon
the
sea
,
there
studded
with
islands
,
and
had
even
mounted
with
Dorothy
to
the
summit
of
the
keep
,
whence
Lindisfarne
and
its
ancient
churches
could
be
clearly
descried
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
no
shipwrecks
occurred
at
the
time
on
that
dangerous
and
rock
-
bound
coast
,
so
that
she
was
spared
any
such
dreadful
sight
,
and
no
half
-
drowned
mariners
were
brought
for
shelter
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Though
Bamborough
Castle
belonged
to
Mr.
Forster
,
he
did
not
inhabit
the
ancient
structure
.
<EOS>
His
residence
,
which
was
comparatively
modern
,
was
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
But
several
of
the
old
towers
were
furnished
,
and
in
one
of
these
Anna
and
Dorothy
were
lodged
,
at
the
particular
desire
of
the
former
,
who
thus
escaped
the
racket
of
a
great
house
full
of
company
,
as
well
as
the
attentions
of
the
host
,
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
,
but
whom
she
could
not
tolerate
.
<EOS>
Every
day
there
was
a
large
party
at
dinner
,
and
at
these
entertainments
Anna
was
forced
to
be
present
,
but
she
was
always
glad
to
get
back
to
the
quiet
old
tower
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
an
important
visitor
unexpectedly
arrived
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
having
described
him
to
her
,
and
painted
him
in
glowing
colours
,
she
was
prepared
for
a
very
distinguished
-
looking
personage
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
far
handsomer
than
she
expected
,
and
she
was
greatly
struck
by
his
manner
as
well
as
by
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
To
her
surprise
and
mortification
,
however
,
he
paid
her
very
little
attention
,
and
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
Dorothy
,
next
to
whom
he
was
placed
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
That
evening
there
were
cards
and
music
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
begged
of
Dorothy
to
sing
,
and
she
readily
complied
,
and
charmed
him
with
a
lively
ditty
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
done
Tom
Forster
came
up
,
and
made
his
sister
relinquish
her
place
at
the
harpsichord
to
Anna
.
<EOS>
Piqued
by
Lord
Derwentwater
's
indifference
,
and
really
possessing
a
splendid
voice
,
Miss
Webb
exerted
herself
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
Never
had
she
sung
or
played
more
brilliantly
than
on
this
occasion
—
never
had
she
looked
more
lovely
:
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
was
electrified
,
and
suddenly
conscious
of
her
transcendent
beauty
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
had
scarcely
observed
her
,
but
now
she
riveted
his
regards
.
<EOS>
Warmly
applauding
her
performance
,
he
prayed
her
to
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
doing
so
,
she
struck
up
a
little
French
lay
,
with
which
he
was
familiar
,
but
which
he
had
never
before
heard
sung
with
such
liveliness
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
At
Lady
Webb
's
instance
,
Anna
gave
some
further
proofs
of
her
extraordinary
vocal
power
.
<EOS>
Her
triumph
was
complete
.
<EOS>
She
felt
sure
she
had
captivated
the
young
earl
,
who
remained
by
her
side
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Indeed
she
fully
expected
a
proposal
on
the
morrow
—
but
when
the
morrow
came
,
Lord
Derwentwater
was
gone
.
<EOS>
He
had
set
off
at
an
early
hour
,
long
before
she
and
Dorothy
came
from
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Why
had
he
departed
so
suddenly
?
<EOS>
No
one
could
tell
.
<EOS>
Anna
was
greatly
put
out
;
but
she
was
not
half
so
much
disappointed
as
Lady
Webb
,
who
thought
her
daughter
had
secured
a
great
prize
.
<EOS>
Good
-
natured
Dorothy
had
manifested
no
resentment
at
being
cut
out
by
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Tom
Forster
had
felt
rather
jealous
,
but
as
he
really
had
received
no
encouragement
from
Miss
Webb
,
he
could
not
complain
.
<EOS>
The
Webbs
remained
ten
days
longer
at
Bamborough
Castle
,
and
during
this
time
nothing
was
heard
of
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Webb
was
determined
not
to
give
him
up
without
another
effort
.
<EOS>
So
she
told
Tom
Forster
that
she
should
like
immensely
to
see
Dilston
,
and
he
promised
to
take
them
all
there
,
on
their
return
to
Dorsetshire
.
<EOS>
The
plan
was
carried
out
,
as
we
have
shown
.
<EOS>
Some
on
horseback
,
some
in
Sir
John
's
great
family
coach
,
encumbered
by
an
immense
quantity
of
luggage
,
attended
by
a
couple
of
female
servants
,
the
party
left
Bamborough
Castle
after
an
early
dinner
,
supped
and
slept
at
Morpeth
,
and
set
out
next
morning
for
Dilston
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
VILady
<EOS>
WebbANNA
WEBB
,
who
rode
a
capital
horse
,
provided
for
her
from
the
Bamborough
stables
,
and
was
accompanied
by
Tom
Forster
and
his
sister
,
was
greatly
struck
by
the
view
of
the
castle
at
the
end
of
the
vista
formed
by
the
long
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
;
and
if
we
may
venture
to
reveal
the
secrets
of
her
breast
,
we
must
state
that
she
ardently
desired
to
become
the
mistress
of
that
stately
mansion
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
desire
lessened
when
she
entered
the
great
quadrangular
court
and
gazed
around
it
.
<EOS>
Certain
of
a
hearty
welcome
,
Tom
Forster
rode
in
first
,
and
cracked
his
hunting
-
whip
loudly
,
as
he
passed
through
the
gateway
,
to
summon
the
servants
.
<EOS>
Newbiggin
and
three
or
four
footmen
rushed
down
the
perron
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
He
contented
himself
with
announcing
to
the
butler
that
he
had
come
to
dine
with
his
lordship
,
and
pass
the
night
at
the
castle
,
and
had
brought
Miss
Forster
and
Sir
John
Webb
and
his
family
with
him
,
and
then
jumping
from
the
saddle
,
gave
his
horse
to
one
of
the
servants
.
<EOS>
To
his
surprise
,
Newbiggin
looked
rather
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
"What!—not
at
home
?
"
cried
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
yes
,
his
lordship
is
at
the
castle
,
but
he
is
engaged
on
rather
particular
business
,
"
replied
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"
Some
one
is
with
him
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
never
mind
!
"
cried
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
He
'll
get
his
business
done
before
dinner-
time
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Charles
Radclyffe
will
take
care
of
us
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
<EOS>
Dorothy
and
Anna
rode
into
the
court
,
and
immediately
afterwards
the
great
lumbering
coach
followed
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
consideration
Newbiggin
made
up
his
mind
to
admit
them
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
Mr.
Forster
was
a
Jacobite
,
and
also
aware
that
Sir
John
Webb
was
a
Roman
Catholic
and
a
staunch
adherent
of
the
Stuarts
,
he
thought
he
could
n't
be
doing
wrong
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
flew
to
the
carriage
,
and
helped
its
occupants
to
alight
,
leaving
the
young
ladies
to
the
care
of
the
grooms
,
and
,
by
the
time
he
had
fulfilled
his
duties
,
Charles
Radclyffe
made
his
appearance
with
Father
Norman
,
and
welcoming
the
party
with
great
cordiality
in
his
brother
's
name
,
led
them
to
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Having
brought
them
to
the
lawn
,
he
left
them
there
with
Father
Norman
,
and
went
in
search
of
the
earl
.
<EOS>
If
Anna
had
been
pleased
with
what
she
had
seen
of
the
castle
,
she
was
quite
enraptured
now
.
<EOS>
Never
,
she
declared
to
Dorothy
,
had
she
beheld
anything
finer
than
the
prospect
from
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
What
charming
scenery
!
<EOS>
what
a
lovely
park
!
<EOS>
what
brown
moors
!
<EOS>
what
woods
!
<EOS>
And
how
well
the
Tyne
looked
in
the
distance!She
next
praised
the
romantic
beauty
of
the
glen
,
with
its
trees
,
and
rushing
stream
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
picturesque
old
bridge
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
everything
delighted
her
.
<EOS>
And
though
she
said
least
about
it
,
she
was
,
perhaps
,
best
pleased
with
the
mansion
itself
.
<EOS>
It
was
larger
and
more
imposing
than
she
expected
,
and
she
again
thought
what
a
fine
thing
it
would
be
to
be
mistress
of
such
a
splendid
place
.
<EOS>
Lady
Webb
was
just
as
much
struck
with
the
castle
and
its
surroundings
as
her
daughter
,
and
fondly
hoped
that
she
might
soon
have
a
stronger
interest
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
was
conversing
with
Father
Norman
,
and
all
she
heard
about
the
young
earl
heightened
her
desire
to
call
him
her
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Father
Norman
spoke
with
the
greatest
warmth
of
his
lordship
's
goodness
of
heart
,
noble
qualities
,
and
chivalrous
character
.
<EOS>
"He
is
like
Bayard
himself
,
"
he
said
;
"
a
chevalier
without
fear
and
without
reproach
.
<EOS>
""With
such
a
splendid
mansion
as
this
,
and
with
such
wealth
as
his
lordship
possesses
,
'
tis
a
wonder
he
does
,
not
marry
,
"
remarked
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
lordship
will
never
marry
except
for
love
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"That
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
noble
and
disinterested
character
you
have
given
him
,
"
said
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
have
thought
,
"
she
added
,
glancing
towards
Dorothy
,
"
that
a
very
charming
young
friend
of
ours
might
have
touched
his
heart
.
<EOS>
""Apparently
not
,
"
replied
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"
I
myself
should
have
been
well
pleased
if
such
had
been
the
case
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
think
Lord
Derwentwater
will
marry
till
our
rightful
king
is
restored
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
he
may
have
to
wait
long
,
"
said
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Charles
Radclyffe
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
Seeing
him
return
alone
,
Lady
Webb
and
her
daughter
began
to
have
some
misgivings
,
but
they
were
quickly
set
at
rest
by
Charles
,
and
a
few
minutes
later
his
lordship
himself
was
seen
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
was
,
of
course
,
accompanied
by
the
prince
,
but
he
left
him
at
the
further
end
of
the
lawn
,
and
went
quickly
on
alone
to
welcome
his
visitors
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
Anna
's
heart
fluttered
as
she
beheld
him
.
<EOS>
His
devoirs
were
first
paid
to
Lady
Webb
,
and
then
to
the
younger
ladies
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
was
quite
easy
in
her
manner
,
and
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
,
but
Anna
courtesied
deeply
to
the
formal
bow
he
addressed
to
her
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
the
flush
on
her
cheek
betrayed
the
state
of
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
could
not
fail
to
perceive
this
,
and
we
doubt
not
he
was
much
gratified
by
the
discovery
,
but
he
was
obliged
to
turn
to
the
others
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
prince
had
come
up
,
and
in
compliance
with
the
instructions
he
had
received
,
Lord
Derwentwater
introduced
him
as
Mr.
Johnson
—
but
without
another
word
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Webb
bowed
rather
stiffly
to
the
stranger
,
and
Forster
was
scarcely
more
polite
;
indeed
,
very
little
notice
was
taken
of
him
,
except
by
the
young
ladies
,
both
of
whom
were
struck
by
his
manner
,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
soon
found
out
that
he
was
a
person
of
distinction
,
and
,
learning
that
he
had
only
just
come
from
France
,
felt
sure
he
must
be
a
messenger
from
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
and
began
to
question
him
about
the
prince
,
displaying
an
interest
in
the
cause
,
that
could
not
but
be
agreeable
to
the
hearer
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
probably
see
the
prince
ere
long
,
"
said
the
Chevalier
,
"
and
will
not
fail
to
tell
him
what
warm
partisans
he
has
among
the
ladies
of
Northumberland
.
<EOS>
""Tell
him
that
Dorothy
Forster
,
of
Bamborough
Castle
,
will
do
her
best
to
aid
him
whenever
he
comes
<EOS>
,
"
cried
that
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"Tell
him
that
Anna
Webb
begins
to
think
he
never
means
to
come
at
all
,
and
fears
he
has
forgotten
his
friends
,
"
added
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Both
messages
shall
reach
him
,
I
promise
you
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
he
learns
how
surpassingly
beautiful
are
the
two
damsels
who
sent
them
he
will
be
doubly
gratified
.
<EOS>
""We
need
no
compliments
,
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
I
am
out
of
patience
with
the
prince
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
so?""Because
he
neglects
so
many
opportunities
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
on
the
throne
now
,
had
he
chosen
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
prince
has
neglected
no
chance
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
not
aware
of
the
difficulties
he
has
had
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
""I
can
partly
guess
them
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
nothing
.
<EOS>
Were
I
in
his
place
I
would
have
made
twenty
attempts
,
and
either
have
succeeded
or
perished
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
admire
your
spirit
.
<EOS>
But
to
win
a
kingdom
,
you
must
have
an
army
.
<EOS>
And
the
prince
has
no
army
.
<EOS>
""He
could
have
one
very
soon
,
"
cried
Anna
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
,
that
is
certain
,
"
added
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
A
small
army
could
be
raised
in
this
county
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
could
bring
five
hundred
men
.
<EOS>
And
my
brother
,
Mr.
Forster
,
could
raise
a
troop
.
<EOS>
""Tell
this
to
the
prince
<EOS>
,
when
you
go
back
,
"
cried
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
Say
that
the
Jacobite
ladies
of
England
are
dying
to
behold
him
.
<EOS>
""That
will
bring
him
,
if
anything
will
,
"
laughed
the
prince
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Lord
Derwentwater
came
up
,
and
said
to
Anna:"May
I
ask
what
message
you
are
sending
to
the
prince?""That
<EOS>
we
are
all
tired
of
waiting
for
him
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
so
often
disappointed
,
that
we
begin
to
think
he
will
never
come
.
<EOS>
""Then
let
me
inform
you
that
I
have
just
received
certain
intelligence
that
his
majesty
is
in
England
at
this
moment
.
"Dorothy
<EOS>
and
Anna
uttered
exclamations
of
surprise
and
delight
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
hear
that
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
latter
to
Sir
John
Webb
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
says
that
his
majesty
,
King
James
the
Third
,
is
now
in
England
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
good
news?""Wonderfully
good
news
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
Where
has
he
landed?""I
ca
n't
tell
you
where
he
has
landed
,
"
cried
Tom
Forster
,
scarcely
repressing
a
joyous
shout
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
tell
you
where
he
is
now
.
<EOS>
Since
none
of
you
have
discovered
him
,
I
'll
be
first
to
kiss
hands
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
rushing
forward
,
he
bent
before
the
prince
,
who
graciously
extended
his
hand
towards
him
.
<EOS>
On
this
there
was
a
general
movement
towards
the
prince
,
who
had
now
entirely
changed
his
deportment
,
and
received
them
all
with
dignified
affability
.
<EOS>
To
Lady
Webb
he
showed
marked
attention
,
and
to
each
of
the
young
ladies
he
had
something
pleasant
to
say
,
and
soon
relieved
any
uneasiness
they
might
feel
as
to
the
freedom
with
which
they
had
spoken
to
him
.
<EOS>
This
little
ceremony
over
,
he
took
Sir
John
Webb
and
Mr.
Forster
apart
,
and
remained
in
earnest
conversation
with
them
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
He
then
returned
to
the
ladies
,
and
proposed
a
walk
in
the
garden
,
to
which
they
delightedly
assented
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIThe
ProposalTHE
gardens
at
Dilston
,
though
somewhat
formally
laid
out
,
as
previously
mentioned
,
were
very
beautiful
,
and
were
just
then
in
perfection
.
<EOS>
The
prince
admired
them
very
much
,
and
of
course
everybody
else
was
enchanted
.
<EOS>
After
wandering
about
for
some
time
—
now
stopping
to
look
at
one
object
,
now
at
another
—
the
prince
walked
on
with
Lady
Webb
,
and
the
party
began
to
disperse
,
moving
about
in
different
directions
.
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
,
Lord
Derwentwater
found
himself
alone
with
Anna
.
<EOS>
He
looked
about
for
Dorothy
,
but
she
was
a
long
way
off
with
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
no
one
was
near
them
.
<EOS>
Close
to
where
they
stood
was
a
rustic
bench
,
shaded
by
a
tree
,
and
saying
she
felt
a
little
fatigued
<EOS>
,
Anna
sat
down
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
could
not
do
otherwise
than
take
a
place
beside
her
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
say
what
thoughts
agitated
her
breast
,
but
she
felt
that
the
critical
moment
had
arrived
,
and
trembled
lest
any
interruption
should
occur
before
the
word
was
uttered
that
might
decide
her
fate
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
look
at
the
lovely
parterre
of
flowers
before
her
—
nor
listen
to
the
plashing
of
the
fountain
—
she
heard
nothing
—
saw
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
the
accents
she
longed
for
were
not
breathed
,
and
Lord
Derwentwater
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
Why
did
he
not
speak?Fearing
the
moment
might
pass
,
she
raised
her
magnificent
eyes
,
which
had
been
thrown
upon
the
ground
,
and
fixed
them
full
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Though
he
spoke
not
,
he
had
been
watching
her
,
and
the
glance
he
now
encountered
pierced
his
breast
.
<EOS>
How
much
was
conveyed
in
that
long
,
passionate
look
!
<EOS>
How
eloquent
was
the
earl
's
reply
!
<EOS>
An
instantaneous
revelation
was
made
to
each
of
the
state
of
the
other
's
heart
.
<EOS>
No
longer
any
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
knew
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
She
felt
he
was
won
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
as
if
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
,
he
took
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
withdraw
it
,
and
still
gazing
tenderly
at
her
,
he
said
in
a
low
voice
,
but
which
was
distinctly
audible:"Can
<EOS>
you
love
me
,
Anna?"Her
glance
became
even
more
passionate
,
as
she
answered:"I
can
—
I
do
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
be
mine
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
earl
,
passing
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
and
drawing
her
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Her
reply
must
have
been
in
the
affirmative
,
yet
it
was
almost
stifled
by
the
kiss
imprinted
on
her
lips
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
just
released
her
from
this
fond
embrace
,
when
they
became
conscious
that
they
were
not
unobserved
.
<EOS>
So
engrossed
were
they
by
each
other
that
they
had
not
hitherto
<EOS>
noticed
the
prince
and
Lady
Webb
on
the
further
side
of
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
,
in
a
moment
,
decided
on
the
course
he
ought
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
"Come
with
me
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
to
Anna
.
<EOS>
And
taking
her
hand
,
he
led
her
towards
her
mother
,
whose
feelings
of
pride
and
satisfaction
may
be
easily
imagined
when
the
announcement
was
made
,
and
her
consent
asked
to
their
union
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
asked
in
a
manner
that
does
not
belong
to
the
present
age
,
and
her
consent
was
given
with
equal
formality
,
and
accompanied
by
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
As
they
arose
from
their
half
-
kneeling
posture
,
the
prince
embraced
the
earl
,
and
said
to
him:"Accept
my
sincere
congratulations
,
cousin
.
<EOS>
Lovelier
bride
you
could
not
have
found
,
and
in
every
other
respect
she
is
worthy
of
you
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
fair
damsel
,
"
he
added
to
Anna
,
who
blushed
deeply
at
the
high
compliments
paid
her
,
"
you
may
likewise
be
heartily
congratulated
on
your
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
You
have
won
a
husband
as
noble
by
nature
as
he
is
by
birth
.
<EOS>
All
happiness
attend
you!"These
gracious
observations
produced
a
strong
effect
on
the
young
pair
to
whom
they
were
addressed
.
<EOS>
The
prince
did
not
,
however
,
tarry
for
their
thanks
,
but
hastened
away
,
saying
he
desired
to
be
first
to
communicate
the
joyful
intelligence
to
Sir
John
Webb
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
party
were
assembled
on
the
terrace
,
and
when
they
saw
the
prince
approaching
,
and
noticed
the
peculiar
expression
of
his
countenance
,
some
suspicion
of
the
truth
crossed
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
,
therefore
,
was
not
surprised
,
though
secretly
enchanted
,
when
a
sign
was
given
them
to
come
forward
,
and
on
obeying
it
,
he
learnt
from
his
highness
's
lips
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
attempt
to
disguise
his
satisfaction
,
and
his
loud
exclamations
soon
let
the
rest
of
the
party
into
the
secret
.
<EOS>
That
the
news
was
perfectly
agreeable
to
all
the
others
can
not
be
asserted
.
<EOS>
The
hopes
of
Tom
Forster
and
his
charming
sister
were
annihilated
.
<EOS>
But
since
the
blow
had
fallen
,
it
must
be
borne
.
<EOS>
So
they
concealed
their
disappointment
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
quite
sure
that
Charles
Radclyffe
was
anxious
that
the
earl
should
marry
,
as
his
own
position
in
the
house
might
be
changed
by
the
event
—
but
at
all
events
,
he
looked
pleased
.
<EOS>
And
Father
Norman
,
who
had
an
almost
paternal
affection
for
his
noble
patron
,
was
certainly
pleased
,
for
he
believed
Lord
Derwentwater
had
taken
a
wise
step
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Webb
,
who
had
been
made
the
happiest
of
men
by
the
success
of
his
wife
's
scheme
,
hurried
off
to
embrace
his
daughter
and
the
earl
,
and
give
them
his
blessing
,
and
all
the
others
followed
to
witness
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Again
certain
painful
feelings
were
stirred
in
the
breasts
of
Forster
and
his
sister
,
but
these
were
controlled
,
and
all
went
off
very
well
.
<EOS>
A
proposition
was
next
made
by
the
prince
,
that
met
with
ready
acceptance
from
all
concerned
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
the
earl
and
his
chosen
bride
should
be
solemnly
contracted
together
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
"Lord
Derwentwater
and
myself
were
brought
up
together
like
brothers
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Long
ago
,
I
promised
to
find
him
a
wife
.
<EOS>
He
has
now
found
one
for
himself
,
and
I
entirely
approve
his
choice
.
<EOS>
Since
I
can
scarce
hope
to
be
present
at
his
lordship
's
marriage
<EOS>
,
it
will
be
specially
agreeable
to
me
to
witness
his
betrothal
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
intimation
was
quite
sufficient
,
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
ceremony
should
be
performed
by
Father
Norman
,
and
should
take
place
,
next
morning
,
in
the
little
chapel
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIIColonel
Oxburgh
and
his
CompanionsMEANWHILE
,
another
arrival
had
taken
place
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
A
party
of
horsemen
,
all
well
mounted
,
and
well
armed
,
rode
into
the
court-
yard
,
and
claimed
the
earl
's
hospitality
,
which
could
not
be
refused
.
<EOS>
The
party
consisted
of
half
a
dozen
Roman
Catholic
gentlemen
—
staunch
Jacobites
—
who
had
banded
together
,
and
were
in
the
habit
of
riding
about
the
country
to
see
how
matters
stood
—
sometimes
stopping
at
one
house
,
sometimes
at
another
—
and
always
heartily
welcome
,
wherever
they
went
.
<EOS>
The
leader
of
the
party
was
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
who
had
fought
and
distinguished
himself
under
James
the
Second
.
<EOS>
His
companions
were
Captain
Nicholas
Wogan
,
Charles
Wogan
,
and
three
other
Jacobite
gentlemen
,
named
Talbot
,
Clifton
,
and
Beaumont
.
<EOS>
They
had
pistols
in
their
holsters
,
and
swords
at
the
side
,
and
presented
a
very
formidable
appearance
,
as
they
rode
together
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Oxburgh
was
an
elderly
man
,
but
in
possession
of
all
his
energies
,
and
expected
a
command
,
if
a
rising
should
take
place
in
favour
of
James
the
Third
.
<EOS>
He
was
tall
and
well
-
built
,
and
though
equipped
in
a
plain
riding
-
suit
,
had
an
unmistakable
military
air
.
<EOS>
His
companions
were
very
much
younger
,
and
all
of
them
looked
like
gentlemen
—
as
indeed
they
were
—
<EOS>
the
most
noticeable
being
the
two
Wogans
.
<EOS>
Both
of
these
young
men
were
very
good
-
looking
,
and
graceful
in
figure
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wogan
had
a
very
interesting
countenance
.
<EOS>
As
they
had
no
servants
with
them
,
each
carried
a
small
valise
attached
to
his
saddle
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Oxburgh
was
an
old
friend
of
Sir
John
Webb
<EOS>
—
indeed
,
they
had
served
together
in
Ireland
—
and
wishing
to
see
him
before
he
left
the
North
,
he
was
proceeding
to
Bamborough
Castle
with
that
object
,
when
he
learnt
that
Sir
John
and
his
family
had
just
taken
their
departure
,
but
meant
to
halt
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
the
colonel
changed
his
course
,
and
went
to
the
latter
place
.
<EOS>
On
his
arrival
,
his
first
inquiries
were
whether
Sir
John
was
there
,
and
being
quickly
satisfied
on
this
point
by
Newbiggin
,
he
dismounted
,
and
his
companions
followed
his
example
.
<EOS>
The
horses
were
taken
to
the
stables
,
and
the
bags
ordered
to
be
brought
into
the
house
,
as
if
it
had
been
an
inn
,
and
while
this
was
being
done
,
the
colonel
again
addressed
Newbiggin
,
and
asked
if
there
was
any
other
company
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
The
butler
smiled
significantly
.
<EOS>
"We
have
a
very
important
person
indeed
here
,
colonel
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
need
keep
no
secret
from
you
and
your
friends
,
because
you
are
all
loyal
.
<EOS>
What
will
you
say
,
gentlemen
,
"
addressing
the
whole
party
,
"
when
I
tell
you
that
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
is
here?""I
should
say
the
statement
is
scarcely
likely
to
be
correct
,
my
good
friend
,
"
rejoined
the
colonel
,
dryly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
jesting
with
us
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
true
,
I
assure
you
,
colonel
,
"
said
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
majesty
is
at
Dilston
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
be
convinced
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
""I
am
convinced
now
,
"
cried
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
can
not
wonder
at
my
incredulity
,
and
you
see
it
was
shared
by
all
my
friends
.
<EOS>
Since
such
is
the
case
,
gentlemen
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
the
others
,
"
we
must
remain
where
we
are
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
present
ourselves
to
the
king
till
we
learn
that
it
is
his
majesty
's
pleasure
to
receive
us
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
doubt
upon
the
point
,
colonel
,
"
said
the
butler
;
"
and
I
will
venture
to
take
you
to
his
majesty
at
once
,
if
you
will
allow
me
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
punctilious
colonel
,
however
,
could
not
be
moved
from
his
position
,
nor
would
he
enter
the
house
,
so
Newbiggin
was
obliged
to
leave
him
and
his
friends
in
order
to
make
the
necessary
announcement
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
Lord
Derwentwater
appeared
,
and
welcomed
them
with
the
utmost
cordiality
,
stating
at
the
same
time
that
his
majesty
would
be
delighted
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
then
conducted
them
to
the
garden
,
and
presented
them
to
the
prince
,
who
accorded
them
a
most
gratifying
reception
,
shaking
hands
with
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
and
treating
him
like
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
"I
have
often
heard
the
king
,
my
father
,
speak
of
you
,
colonel
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
always
with
regard
.
<EOS>
He
was
deeply
sensible
of
your
attachment
to
him
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
attachment
<EOS>
I
ever
felt
towards
his
majesty
is
now
transferred
to
his
son
,
"
replied
the
colonel
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
hope
the
time
has
come
when
I
can
prove
my
loyalty
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
""We
will
talk
of
that
anon
,
my
dear
colonel
,
"
replied
the
prince
.
<EOS>
And
he
then
addressed
himself
to
the
others
,
to
each
of
whom
he
had
something
agreeable
to
say
.
<EOS>
His
highness
seemed
particularly
pleased
with
Captain
Wogan
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
exchanged
a
greeting
with
Sir
John
Webb
and
Forster
,
nor
did
he
omit
to
pay
his
devoirs
to
Lady
Webb
and
the
younger
ladies
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IXConfessionFEELING
<EOS>
that
their
presence
might
be
some
restraint
upon
the
meeting
,
the
ladies
soon
afterwards
withdrew
,
and
entered
the
house
,
accompanied
by
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
,
Lady
Webb
embraced
her
daughter
with
more
than
her
customary
warmth
,
and
again
congratulated
her
on
her
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
"You
are
now
in
the
most
enviable
position
in
which
a
girl
can
be
placed
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
obtained
as
a
husband
one
of
the
richest
and
most
powerful
nobles
in
the
land
,
and
who
,
in
addition
to
these
recommendations
,
has
youth
,
good
looks
,
and
extreme
amiability
.
<EOS>
Could
you
desire
more?""No
,
dearest
mamma
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
be
grateful
,
and
I
am
grateful
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
deserve
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
return
thanks
to
Heaven
for
its
great
goodness
towards
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
Father
Norman
alone
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
entirely
approve
of
your
resolution
,
my
dear
child
,
"
replied
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Remain
here
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
the
holy
father
to
you
.
"She
<EOS>
then
left
her
,
and
the
interval
between
her
departure
,
and
the
good
priest
's
appearance
,
was
passed
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
Father
Norman
found
her
on
her
knees
before
a
small
image
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
which
was
in
the
room
,
and
did
not
interrupt
her
.
<EOS>
When
she
arose
,
he
expressed
his
great
satisfaction
at
finding
her
thus
employed
.
<EOS>
"I
am
now
certain
his
lordship
has
chosen
well
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
hope
he
will
never
regret
the
step
he
has
taken
,
father
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Strive
<EOS>
earnestly
to
make
him
happy
,
dear
daughter
,
and
you
can
not
fail
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
aught
to
say
to
me?""I
desire
to
disburden
my
conscience
father
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
much
upon
it
,
but
I
shall
feel
easier
when
I
have
spoken
.
<EOS>
""You
will
do
well
,
daughter
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
He
then
sat
down
,
and
she
knelt
beside
him
,
and
cleared
her
breast
of
all
that
weighed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
more
than
many
a
maiden
would
have
to
avow
,
but
the
good
father
was
strict
,
and
imposed
a
slight
penance
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"You
must
debar
yourself
from
the
society
of
him
you
love
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
She
uttered
an
exclamation
,
but
the
priest
went
on:"For
the
rest
of
the
day
you
must
remain
in
the
seclusion
of
this
chamber
,
so
that
your
thoughts
may
be
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
Part
of
the
night
must
be
passed
in
vigil
and
prayer
.
<EOS>
This
will
be
a
fitting
preparation
for
the
ceremony
you
are
about
to
go
through
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
will
Lord
Derwentwater
think
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"I
will
take
care
<EOS>
he
receives
such
explanation
as
may
be
necessary
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
again
enjoin
solitude
and
reflection
.
<EOS>
Later
on
,
I
will
take
you
to
the
chapel
,
where
your
vigils
must
be
kept
till
midnight
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
not
to
quit
this
room
,
without
my
sanction
.
<EOS>
""I
will
obey
you
,
father
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XA
BanquetA
GRAND
dinner
was
given
that
day
in
the
great
banqueting-
hall
of
the
castle
,
at
which
the
prince
and
all
the
guests
assisted
with
the
exception
of
her
,
whom
the
noble
host
would
have
preferred
to
all
the
others
.
<EOS>
Being
told
by
Lady
Webb
that
her
daughter
was
rather
overcome
by
the
excitement
of
the
morning
,
and
deemed
it
best
to
keep
her
room
,
he
submitted
to
the
disappointment
with
the
best
grace
he
could
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
was
magnificent
,
though
little
time
had
been
allowed
for
its
preparation
.
<EOS>
Still
,
with
the
resources
at
Lord
Derwentwater
's
command
,
a
great
deal
can
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
The
prince
sat
on
the
right
of
the
earl
,
and
on
his
lordship
's
left
was
placed
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
Next
to
her
ladyship
was
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
and
next
to
the
prince
,
on
the
right
,
was
Sir
John
Webb
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
Squire
of
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
record
how
the
rest
of
the
company
was
placed
,
but
we
must
mention
that
the
fair
Dorothy
was
not
very
far
from
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
,
the
party
lacked
its
chief
attraction
—
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
Lord
Derwentwater
—
but
he
was
so
much
occupied
by
the
prince
that
he
had
not
much
time
to
think
of
the
fair
absentee
;
and
besides
,
Lady
Webb
assured
him
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
cause
for
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
The
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
was
in
high
spirits
.
<EOS>
No
contretemps
of
any
kind
had
occurred
since
his
arrival
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
All
the
guests
were
devoted
to
his
cause
,
and
some
of
them
were
his
warmest
partisans
.
<EOS>
Of
the
attachment
of
Sir
John
Webb
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
he
had
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Of
Forster
's
loyalty
he
was
not
quite
so
sure
,
and
he
therefore
paid
him
particular
attention
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
a
gracious
word
for
every
one
,
and
<EOS>
not
a
single
person
present
could
complain
that
the
prince
had
overlooked
him
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
his
highness
took
care
to
make
it
understood
that
he
desired
his
presence
should
be
no
restraint
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
therefore
passed
off
admirably
,
and
as
the
wine
was
not
stinted
,
and
bumpers
were
quaffed
according
to
the
good
old
custom
,
the
enthusiasm
of
the
guests
rose
to
a
very
high
pitch
,
and
could
scarcely
be
repressed
.
<EOS>
But
it
soon
found
vent
when
the
cloth
was
drawn
,
and
glasses
were
filled
to
the
brim
.
<EOS>
The
noble
host
arose
,
and
with
him
rose
every
guest
—
save
one
—
and
the
hall
rang
with
shouts
of
"
Long
live
King
James
the
Third
.
<EOS>
"Lady
<EOS>
Webb
and
Dorothy
then
disappeared
,
and
all
the
servants
having
left
the
room
,
except
Newbiggin
,
whose
discretion
could
be
relied
on
,
some
serious
discussion
took
place
.
<EOS>
As
yet
the
prince
had
not
made
known
his
design
of
seeking
an
interview
with
the
queen
,
his
sister
;
and
it
was
now
,
at
his
highness
's
request
,
disclosed
by
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
A
deep
silence
ensued
.
<EOS>
"It
appears
that
you
do
not
approve
my
plan
,
gentlemen
,
"
remarked
the
prince
,
after
a
short
pause
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
liege
,
"
replied
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
answering
for
the
others
,
"
we
all
hoped
and
believed
that
you
were
come
to
call
us
to
arms
,
and
we
can
not
conceal
our
disappointment
when
we
find
that
,
instead
of
making
a
determined
attempt
to
recover
the
throne
,
which
we
are
persuaded
would
be
successful
,
your
majesty
is
about
to
appeal
to
the
queen
,
who
has
no
sympathy
or
affection
for
you
,
and
is
hostile
to
our
religion
.
<EOS>
Rest
assured
,
the
attempt
will
be
useless
,
if
it
does
not
lead
to
other
ill
consequences
.
<EOS>
Abandon
it
,
therefore
,
I
pray
you
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
an
insurrection
in
your
majesty
's
favour
would
be
attended
with
success
.
<EOS>
That
we
are
fully
prepared
for
it
,
I
will
not
assert
.
<EOS>
But
a
very
short
time
will
enable
us
to
get
ready
a
sufficient
force
to
march
towards
London
,
and
we
shall
gather
strength
as
we
go
on
.
<EOS>
None
can
be
better
acquainted
with
the
feeling
of
the
country
than
myself
and
my
friends
,
who
have
visited
the
houses
of
half
the
Jacobites
and
High
Church
Tories
in
the
North
of
England
,
and
I
can
state
positively
that
a
rising
would
be
hailed
by
many
influential
persons
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
Should
your
majesty
decide
on
leading
the
army
in
person
—
as
I
trust
you
will
—
thousands
will
flock
to
your
standard
,
and
you
will
find
yourself
resistless
as
well
from
the
number
of
your
followers
as
from
the
justice
of
your
cause
.
<EOS>
That
your
majesty
is
the
rightful
King
of
England
can
not
be
denied
.
<EOS>
Why
then
allow
the
crown
to
be
kept
from
you
—
even
for
a
day
?
<EOS>
Do
not
sue
for
it
,
but
demand
it
;
and
if
it
be
refused
,
take
it!"The
exclamations
that
arose
from
the
company
<EOS>
made
it
evident
that
they
all
agreed
with
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
But
though
stirred
by
the
colonel
's
energetic
language
,
the
prince
was
not
to
be
turned
from
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
"I
have
already
explained
to
Lord
Derwentwater
my
reasons
for
the
course
I
am
about
to
pursue
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Like
yourselves
he
has
endeavoured
to
dissuade
me
from
my
design
—
but
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
set
out
for
London
tomorrow
,
or
next
day
,
at
the
latest
—
and
his
lordship
will
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
""Without
an
escort
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
That
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
Since
your
majesty
is
resolved
on
this
rash
step
,
my
friends
and
myself
will
attend
you
.
<EOS>
Do
I
not
express
your
wishes
,
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
to
the
others
.
<EOS>
"Most
certainly
,
"
replied
Captain
Wogan
,
answering
for
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
proud
to
escort
his
majesty
,
if
he
will
permit
us
.
<EOS>
""I
accept
your
offer
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
calculate
on
such
good
company
.
<EOS>
""We
may
be
of
use
to
your
majesty
on
the
journey
,
"
remarked
Captain
Wogan
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
doubt
it
not
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Forster
.
<EOS>
"I
pray
your
majesty
to
excuse
me
,
"
replied
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
frankly
own
I
would
rather
not
be
engaged
in
the
expedition
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
the
prince
,
with
affected
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
very
well
without
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
see
that
I
have
not
made
myself
understood
,
my
liege
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
to
fight
for
you
,
and
if
need
be
,
die
for
you
,
but
I
will
not
be
instrumental
in
delivering
you
to
your
enemies
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
I
have
done
you
an
injustice
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
then
took
another
turn
,
and
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
was
manifested
both
by
Sir
John
Webb
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
as
to
the
prince
's
future
plans
,
but
his
highness
displayed
considerable
reserve
on
this
point
,
and
did
not
choose
to
gratify
them
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
soon
afterwards
retired
,
and
Lord
Derwentwater
went
with
him
,
leaving
Charles
Radclyffe
to
attend
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
Those
were
hard
-
drinking
days
,
and
the
Jacobites
were
as
fond
of
good
claret
,
as
their
predecessors
the
Cavaliers
.
<EOS>
We
are
afraid
to
say
how
many
magnums
were
emptied
on
the
occasion
,
but
before
the
party
broke
up
,
which
it
did
not
do
till
a
late
hour
,
a
general
resolution
was
come
to
,
that
a
more
strenuous
effort
should
be
made
on
the
morrow
,
to
induce
his
majesty
to
forego
his
ill-
advised
journey
to
London
,
and
instead
of
endangering
his
safety
by
such
a
senseless
attempt
,
to
set
up
his
standard
,
and
summon
all
his
adherents
to
join
him
.
<EOS>
Then
he
might
proceed
to
London
,
as
soon
as
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
A
loud
shout
,
with
which
his
majesty
's
name
was
coupled
,
concluded
a
vehement
harangue
made
by
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
and
the
party
broke
up
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
retired
to
rest
,
but
Tom
Forster
and
two
or
three
others
adjourned
to
a
smaller
room
not
far
from
the
butler
's
pantry
;
where
a
bowl
of
capital
punch
was
provided
for
them
by
Newbiggin
.

CHAPTER
XIA
Mysterious
Occurrence
in
the
ChapelANNA
WEBB
submitted
unrepiningly
to
the
penance
enjoined
by
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
She
remained
in
her
own
room
,
and
was
not
distracted
by
a
visit
either
from
her
mother
,
or
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
Some
refreshments
were
brought
her
by
a
female
servant
,
but
they
were
untouched
.
<EOS>
Several
hours
were
thus
passed
in
solitude
and
prayer
,
and
night
had
come
on
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
when
the
priest
would
come
,
according
to
his
promise
,
to
take
her
to
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
appeared
,
and
desired
her
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
Wishing
to
avoid
the
servants
,
who
were
crowded
in
the
great
hall
,
he
led
her
down
a
back
staircase
to
a
small
room
on
the
ground
floor
,
where
he
obtained
a
lantern
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
,
they
had
crossed
the
court
,
and
reached
the
door
of
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
The
little
structure
,
it
has
been
said
,
was
screened
by
trees
,
and
the
place
was
so
dark
,
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
the
door
,
save
with
the
lantern
's
aid
.
<EOS>
A
slight
shiver
ran
through
Anna
's
frame
as
she
entered
the
building
,
but
she
attributed
the
feeling
to
the
damp
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Father
Norman
had
lighted
a
couple
of
tapers
at
the
altar
,
and
their
feeble
glimmer
enabled
her
to
survey
the
place
.
<EOS>
Its
simplicity
and
diminutive
size
pleased
her
,
and
reassured
her
.
<EOS>
Knowing
she
would
have
to
remain
there
alone
till
midnight
,
she
might
have
felt
some
misgivings
had
the
room
been
large
and
sombre
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
she
was
not
aware
that
there
was
a
vault
beneath
,
in
which
rested
the
earl
's
ancestors
.
<EOS>
Marble
tablets
were
on
the
walls
,
but
she
did
not
read
them
.
<EOS>
After
an
exhortation
,
to
which
she
listened
devoutly
,
the
priest
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Thus
left
alone
,
she
knelt
down
at
the
altar
,
and
was
soon
engrossed
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
For
awhile
she
continued
thus
employed
,
but
at
length
a
feeling
of
drowsiness
came
over
her
,
which
she
found
it
impossible
to
resist
.
<EOS>
How
long
she
slept
she
could
not
tell
,
but
when
she
awoke
the
place
was
buried
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
What
had
happened
while
she
slumbered
?
<EOS>
And
how
came
the
tapers
to
be
extinguished?Very
much
alarmed
,
she
started
to
her
feet
,
and
somehow
—
though
she
scarcely
knew
how
—
made
her
way
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
fastened
.
<EOS>
Father
Norman
must
have
locked
it
when
he
went
out
.
<EOS>
She
was
thus
to
be
kept
in
that
dreadful
place
—
<EOS>
for
dreadful
it
now
seemed
to
her
—
till
his
return
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
guess
the
hour
,
but
she
might
have
to
wait
long
—
very
long
!
<EOS>
Moments
seemed
ages
now
.
<EOS>
Her
terror
was
insupportable
.
<EOS>
Just
then
she
heard
the
castle
clock
,
and
counted
the
strokes
.
<EOS>
Eleven
!
<EOS>
Another
agonising
hour
had
to
be
borne!—another
hour!—when
five
minutes
had
been
intolerable!Rendered
desperate
by
terror
<EOS>
,
she
went
back
to
the
altar
,
and
kneeling
down
once
more
,
prayed
for
deliverance
.
<EOS>
Becoming
somewhat
calmer
,
she
felt
ashamed
of
her
weakness
,
and
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
the
tapers
might
have
gone
out
by
accident
.
<EOS>
The
notion
gave
her
momentary
courage
.
<EOS>
But
her
fears
returned
with
greater
force
than
before
as
she
heard
a
deep
sigh
,
seemingly
proceeding
from
some
one
close
beside
her
,
and
she
fancied
she
discerned
a
dusky
figure
.
<EOS>
"Who
is
there
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
,
holy
father?"No
answer
was
returned
,
but
a
slight
sound
was
heard
,
and
the
figure
seemed
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
She
heard
and
saw
no
more
.
<EOS>
Uttering
a
cry
,
she
fell
senseless
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
,
where
she
was
found
shortly
afterwards
by
Father
Norman
and
her
mother
.
<EOS>
The
former
having
brought
the
lantern
with
him
,
her
situation
was
perceived
at
once
,
and
the
prompt
application
of
a
smelling
-
bottle
by
Lady
Webb
quickly
restored
her
to
consciousness
.
<EOS>
She
was
able
to
walk
back
to
the
mansion
,
but
begged
not
to
be
questioned
as
to
the
cause
of
<EOS>
her
fright
till
the
morrow
,
when
she
should
have
quite
recovered
from
its
effects
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIIA
Letter
from
the
Earl
of
MarNEXT
morning
she
related
the
mysterious
occurrence
to
them
both
,
but
they
treated
it
very
lightly
,
though
neither
could
understand
how
the
tapers
had
been
extinguished
.
<EOS>
All
the
rest
they
regarded
as
the
effect
of
an
over
-
excited
imagination
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
one
could
have
entered
the
chapel
,
"
remarked
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
locked
the
door
,
and
took
the
key
with
me
.
<EOS>
However
,
you
must
dismiss
all
these
thoughts
from
your
mind
,
daughter
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
the
chapel
will
present
a
very
different
appearance
from
what
it
did
last
night
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
—
it
will
be
the
scene
of
your
betrothal
,
"
said
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
would
rather
the
ceremony
took
place
elsewhere
,
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"It
can
not
be
,
"
said
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"
His
lordship
has
arranged
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
prince
will
be
present
,
and
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
the
household
to
be
deprived
of
the
sight
.
<EOS>
""It
would
also
be
a
great
disappointment
to
Sir
John
and
myself
,
"
observed
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
are
several
guests
in
the
castle
who
ought
not
to
be
excluded
.
<EOS>
For
many
reasons
,
therefore
,
there
must
be
no
change
in
the
plan
.
<EOS>
""Don't
say
a
word
,
mamma
,
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
convinced
.
<EOS>
My
objections
were
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
The
morning
is
delightful
,
and
a
walk
in
the
garden
will
set
me
quite
right
.
<EOS>
""You
will
find
Lord
Derwentwater
,
his
majesty
,
and
almost
all
the
company
assembled
on
the
lawn
,
"
said
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
I
will
take
you
thither
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
Father
Norman
will
accompany
us
.
<EOS>
""With
the
greatest
pleasure
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
On
Anna
's
appearance
,
Lord
Derwentwater
,
who
was
standing
with
the
company
on
the
terrace
,
came
forward
to
meet
her
;
and
as
he
approached
,
he
remarked
that
she
looked
very
pale
.
<EOS>
This
did
not
detract
from
her
beauty
,
but
rather
gave
interest
to
her
countenance
—
at
least
,
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
made
some
slight
allusion
to
the
circumstance
,
but
she
laughed
it
off
.
<EOS>
Not
much
passed
between
them
,
for
the
prince
presently
came
up
to
offer
her
his
greetings
,
and
by
this
time
her
cheek
was
flushed
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
news
for
you
,
fair
lady
,
"
said
his
highness
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
desire
to
be
the
first
to
communicate
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
rob
you
of
your
lover
,
so
you
may
rest
quite
easy
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
My
proposed
journey
to
London
will
not
be
undertaken
.
<EOS>
A
messenger
has
just
arrived
at
the
castle
bringing
me
a
letter
from
the
Earl
of
Mar
,
Secretary
of
State
to
Queen
Anne
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
had
engaged
that
I
should
see
the
queen
,
and
led
me
to
hope
that
great
results
would
follow
from
the
interview
.
<EOS>
These
confident
expectations
are
now
at
an
end
,
and
my
project
must
be
given
up
.
<EOS>
Lord
Mar
writes
that
the
queen
,
forgetful
of
her
promises
,
refuses
to
receive
me
,
and
that
if
I
should
present
myself
at
Saint
James
's
Palace
,
he
will
not
answer
for
my
safety
.
<EOS>
Under
such
circumstances
,
it
would
be
madness
to
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
that
I
arranged
with
the
Earl
of
Mar
to
write
to
me
here
,
as
if
I
had
not
heard
from
him
,
I
should
have
started
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
What
might
then
have
befallen
me
<EOS>
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
Perchance
,
imprisonment
in
the
Tower
,
in
the
hope
of
compelling
me
to
relinquish
my
pretentions
to
the
crown
—
but
that
I
never
would
have
done
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
majesty
need
not
give
us
that
assurance
,
"
cried
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
But
imprisonment
would
have
been
grievous
,
and
might
have
disheartened
your
friends
.
<EOS>
""From
the
first
I
have
been
opposed
to
the
scheme
,
as
your
majesty
is
aware
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
;
"
and
I
can
not
,
therefore
,
affect
to
regret
its
abandonment
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
wonder
you
are
better
pleased
to
remain
where
you
are
,
cousin
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
be
far
better
pleased
if
your
majesty
will
decide
upon
summoning
all
your
partisans
to
arms
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
<EOS>
would
rejoice
me
more
than
to
see
ten
thousand
men
assembled
at
the
castle
,
"
said
Anna
with
increased
enthusiasm
,
"
and
eager
for
their
king
to
lead
them
on
to
victory
.
<EOS>
That
is
how
I
should
like
to
see
your
majesty
march
to
London
—
and
Lord
Derwentwater
with
you
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
I
will
never
be
left
behind
,
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Fire
lighted
up
the
prince
's
eyes
as
they
spoke
,
but
it
faded
away
.
<EOS>
"It
can
not
be
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
""What
can
not
be
,
my
liege
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Anna
,
regarding
him
fixedly
.
"
<EOS>
Not
the
insurrection
?
<EOS>
Not
the
march
to
London?""No
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Mar
,
in
his
letter
,
counsels
me
to
make
no
immediate
movement
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
what
reason
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Lord
Derwentwater
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"He
gives
no
reason
,
"
rejoined
the
prince
.
"
<EOS>
But
Lord
Mar
knows
the
feeling
of
the
clans
,
and
evidently
deems
the
present
juncture
unpropitious
to
a
rising
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
tell
what
may
be
the
state
of
the
clans
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
,
scarcely
able
to
repress
his
impatience
,
"
but
I
am
certain
the
opportunity
is
favourable
in
the
North
of
England
—
as
can
soon
be
shown
,
if
your
majesty
will
give
the
signal
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
commit
myself
to
any
decisive
step
now
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
prince
,
who
when
thus
urged
,
seemed
to
shrink
from
the
enterprise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
think
it
will
be
prudent
for
me
to
remain
here
long
.
<EOS>
""What
danger
does
your
majesty
apprehend
?
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
All
are
devoted
to
you
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
traitors
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
have
many
enemies
in
the
country
,
and
the
Earl
of
Mar
bids
me
'
beware
,
'
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"We
will
defend
you
against
your
enemies
,
my
liege
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
fear
them
.
<EOS>
Immediate
preparations
shall
be
made
.
<EOS>
""No
haste
is
needful
,
cousin
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
strong
guard
enough
,
"
he
added
,
glancing
at
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
his
friends
,
who
were
standing
at
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
the
day
pass
tranquilly
—
if
it
will
.
<EOS>
To-
morrow
,
we
will
consider
what
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
grant
your
majesty
may
change
your
mind
in
the
interim
!
"
<EOS>
observed
Anna
.
<EOS>
"If
you
exercise
your
powers
of
persuasion
,
fair
lady
,
there
is
no
saying
what
you
may
accomplish
,
"
said
the
prince
,
gallantly
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
bell
was
heard
,
and
Newbiggin
came
forth
with
two
other
servants
in
livery
,
and
respectfully
announced
breakfast
.
<EOS>
The
prince
offered
his
hand
to
Anna
and
led
her
to
the
house
,
and
the
rest
of
the
party
followed
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIIIThe
BetrothalA
PROFUSE
breakfast
,
served
in
the
good
old
style
,
awaited
them
in
the
dining-
room
.
<EOS>
The
sideboard
groaned
with
the
weight
of
huge
cold
joints
,
hams
,
tongues
,
and
pasties
;
and
broiled
trout
and
salmon
in
abundance
appeared
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
How
many
good
things
there
were
besides
in
the
shape
of
cutlets
and
omelettes
,
we
can
not
tell
,
but
nothing
seemed
wanting
.
<EOS>
Chocolate
was
handed
to
the
ladies
,
but
claret
suited
the
gentlemen
best
,
though
in
some
instances
a
flagon
of
strong
ale
was
preferred
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
over
,
the
ladies
withdrew
to
prepare
for
the
ceremony
appointed
to
take
place
in
the
chapel
,
while
the
prince
again
walked
forth
on
the
terrace
,
in
company
with
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Sir
John
Webb
,
and
gazed
with
fresh
delight
at
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
his
companions
,
with
Tom
Forster
,
adjourned
to
the
stables
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
deal
of
conjecture
among
them
as
to
the
prince
's
plans
,
which
now
seemed
quite
undecided
;
but
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
rising
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
they
all
rejoiced
that
the
hazardous
—
<EOS>
and
as
they
deemed
it
,
useless
—
journey
to
London
had
been
abandoned
.
<EOS>
"Something
<EOS>
ought
to
be
done
,
"
cried
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
puzzles
me
to
say
what
.
<EOS>
""Have
patience
,
"
said
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
we
sha
n't
remain
long
idle
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
will
be
forced
to
make
a
move
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
"Long
<EOS>
before
the
hour
appointed
for
the
betrothal
,
the
little
chapel
was
filled
.
<EOS>
All
the
household
craved
permission
to
witness
the
ceremony
,
and
none
were
refused
.
<EOS>
The
guests
entered
at
the
same
time
,
and
found
places
where
they
could
.
<EOS>
But
little
room
was
left
,
as
may
be
imagined
,
when
all
these
persons
were
accommodated
.
<EOS>
In
the
large
pew
were
the
prince
with
Charles
Radclyffe
,
Mr.
Forster
and
his
sister
—
the
latter
looking
bright
and
blooming
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
little
edifice
in
momentary
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
her
to
whom
he
was
about
to
be
affianced
.
<EOS>
She
came
,
leaning
on
her
father
's
arm
,
and
attended
by
her
mother
—
not
decked
in
bridal
attire
—
not
draped
in
a
bridal
veil
—
for
such
adornments
would
have
been
unsuitable
to
the
occasion
,
but
arrayed
in
a
charming
costume
of
azure
satin
and
lace
.
<EOS>
After
salutations
had
passed
,
Sir
John
Webb
consigned
his
lovely
daughter
to
the
earl
,
and
followed
them
with
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
An
irrepressible
murmur
of
admiration
burst
forth
as
the
youthful
pair
moved
towards
the
altar
,
where
they
immediately
knelt
down
,
and
a
group
was
formed
behind
them
of
which
the
prince
was
the
principal
figure
—
his
highness
having
come
with
the
others
from
the
pew
.
<EOS>
Not
till
a
prayer
was
recited
could
the
spectators
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
scene
at
the
altar
,
and
if
this
was
quickly
hidden
from
their
sight
they
heard
the
vow
pronounced
that
bound
the
pair
together
,
and
they
likewise
heard
Father
Norman
's
benediction
.
<EOS>
Those
near
the
altar
saw
the
earl
embrace
his
affianced
bride
as
they
rose
together
,
and
some
of
them
remarked
that
she
looked
strangely
pale
.
<EOS>
Only
for
a
minute
,
for
her
colour
quickly
returned
.
<EOS>
The
prince
,
however
,
noticed
the
circumstance
,
and
so
did
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
But
both
attributed
it
to
deep
emotion
.
<EOS>
Nothing
whatever
marred
the
ceremony
,
the
sole
fault
of
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
those
present
,
was
that
it
was
too
brief
.
<EOS>
Several
of
the
household
grouped
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
path
leading
to
the
gate
to
offer
their
good
wishes
to
the
newly
-
affianced
pair
as
they
passed
by
.
<EOS>
Among
these
were
old
Nicholas
Ribbleton
,
and
an
elderly
dame
who
,
like
himself
,
had
lived
in
the
family
for
years
.
<EOS>
"Eh
!
<EOS>
she
's
a
bonnie
lass
!
"
<EOS>
cried
this
old
woman
,
after
scrutinising
her
sharply
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
if
she
'll
make
his
lordship
happy
.
<EOS>
He
had
better
have
chosen
Dorothy
Forster
.
<EOS>
""Why
,
what
ails
her
?
"
said
Ribbleton
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
can
not
exactly
tell
—
but
there
's
a
look
about
her
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
it
's
too
late
to
change
now
,
Grace
,
"
observed
Ribbleton
.
<EOS>
"
The
troth
is
plighted
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
that
's
the
worst
of
it
,
"
rejoined
the
old
woman
.
"
<EOS>
But
a
time
may
come
,
when
his
lordship
will
wish
what
's
done
were
undone
.
<EOS>
"This
was
the
only
discordant
note
uttered
,
and
it
reached
no
other
ear
<EOS>
but
Ribbleton
's
,
and
him
<EOS>
it
made
angry
.
<EOS>
So
he
walked
off
,
and
left
the
old
prophetess
of
ill
to
herself
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIVThe
SpyTHE
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
in
festivity
and
amusement
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
and
his
affianced
bride
did
not
stray
beyond
the
garden
,
and
seemed
so
perfectly
happy
in
each
other
's
society
that
no
one
went
near
them
.
<EOS>
The
prince
explored
the
mysterious
glen
,
and
Charles
Radclyffe
acted
as
his
guide
,
introducing
him
to
all
the
beauties
of
the
place
,
and
relating
all
the
legends
connected
with
it
.
<EOS>
A
large
party
accompanied
his
highness
,
including
Lady
Webb
and
Dorothy
Forster
—
the
latter
of
whom
had
often
seen
the
place
before
,
but
was
quite
as
much
enchanted
with
it
as
ever
.
<EOS>
The
visit
to
this
picturesque
dell
,
which
has
been
previously
described
,
occupied
some
time
,
for
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
But
neither
the
prince
,
nor
any
of
those
with
him
,
were
aware
,
that
while
they
were
tracking
the
course
of
the
Devil
's
Water
over
its
rocky
channel
,
or
standing
near
the
pool
,
they
were
watched
by
a
person
concealed
amid
the
brushwood
on
its
banks
.
<EOS>
This
person
was
an
emissary
of
Sir
William
Lorraine
of
Bywell
Park
,
high
sheriff
of
the
county
,
and
a
strong
supporter
of
the
Government
.
<EOS>
That
very
morning
,
Sir
William
had
received
the
astounding
information
that
the
Pretender
had
arrived
at
Dilston
Castle
,
and
that
a
rising
in
his
favour
was
imminent
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
county
;
but
as
the
news
came
from
a
suspicious
source
,
the
high
sheriff
,
though
alarmed
,
did
not
entirely
credit
it
,
and
before
taking
any
active
measures
—
such
as
raising
a
posse
-
comitatus
,
or
calling
out
the
militia
—
he
determined
to
send
a
couple
of
spies
to
Dilston
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
the
report
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
emissaries
was
now
concealed
,
as
we
have
stated
,
among
the
trees
overhanging
the
glen
.
<EOS>
Without
betraying
himself
,
he
got
sufficiently
near
the
party
to
hear
their
discourse
,
and
soon
learnt
enough
to
convince
him
that
the
plainly
attired
,
but
distinguished
-
looking
young
man
,
whom
he
beheld
,
and
to
whom
so
much
attention
was
paid
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
the
rest
,
was
no
other
than
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
clearly
ascertained
this
point
,
he
stole
away
,
mounted
his
horse
,
which
he
had
left
in
a
thicket
near
the
moor
,
and
galloped
off
to
convey
the
important
information
to
Sir
William
Lorraine
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
Bywell
Park
,
he
found
the
high
sheriff
anxiously
expecting
him
,
and
called
out:"I
have
seen
the
Pretender
,
Sir
William
—
seen
him
with
my
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
""You
are
certain
of
it
,
Jesmond?""I
<EOS>
saw
him
in
the
glen
by
the
side
of
the
Devil
's
Water
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
large
party
with
him
,
and
I
heard
several
of
'em
address
him
as
'
your
majesty
.
<EOS>
'""Enough
,
"
cried
the
high
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
your
work
well
,
Jesmond
.
<EOS>
But
where
have
you
left
Hedgeley?""I've
seen
nothing
of
him
since
we
got
to
Dilston
,
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
castle
,
and
I
went
to
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
right
course
it
appears
,
for
I
soon
found
the
person
I
was
looking
for
,
and
without
asking
any
questions
,
or
letting
myself
be
seen
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
Hedgeley
has
not
been
seized
as
a
spy
,
"
said
the
high
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
he
has
,
he
'll
tell
nothing
,
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
fear
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
take
the
place
by
surprise
to
-
morrow
,
you
can
do
it
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
has
taken
no
precautions
.
<EOS>
With
half
a
dozen
mounted
men
I
could
have
taken
the
Pretender
prisoner
myself
,
and
have
carried
him
off
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
you
had
done
so
,
Jesmond
,
"
laughed
the
high
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
saved
me
the
trouble
of
getting
a
party
of
men
together
.
<EOS>
I
must
set
about
the
task
without
delay
.
<EOS>
You
think
all
will
be
safe
at
Dilston
till
to
-
morrow?""Not
<EOS>
a
doubt
about
it
,
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
's
guests
seem
to
be
amusing
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
think
—
from
what
I
overheard
—
that
his
lordship
has
a
grand
banquet
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Certainly
,
some
festivities
are
taking
place
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""It
would
be
a
pity
to
disturb
them
,
"
said
the
high
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
I
will
present
myself
at
the
castle
with
sufficient
force
to
render
all
resistance
useless
.
<EOS>
"Hedgeley
<EOS>
,
the
emissary
to
Dilston
,
had
not
fared
so
well
as
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
Stopped
at
the
gate
,
and
unable
to
explain
his
business
entirely
to
the
porter
's
satisfaction
,
he
was
locked
up
in
a
strong
room
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
by
Colonel
Oxburgh
's
order
,
who
chanced
to
be
in
the
court
at
the
time
,
and
interrogated
him
.
<EOS>
Except
detention
,
the
spy
had
nothing
to
complain
of
,
for
he
had
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
.
<EOS>
Jesmond
had
correctly
informed
the
high
sheriff
,
when
he
told
him
that
a
grand
dinner
would
be
given
that
day
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
A
vast
deal
of
handsome
plate
was
displayed
at
the
banquet
,
which
was
far
more
agreeable
to
the
noble
host
than
the
dinner
of
the
previous
day
,
since
it
was
graced
by
the
presence
of
his
affianced
bride
,
who
now
sat
next
to
him
,
and
looked
more
charming
than
ever
,
being
beautifully
dressed
,
and
in
high
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
prince
was
likewise
in
a
very
lively
mood
,
and
contributed
to
the
general
gaiety
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
there
was
music
in
the
grand
saloon
,
which
was
brilliantly
lighted
up
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Anna
produced
a
great
effect
,
and
her
magnificent
voice
enraptured
the
prince
as
much
as
it
had
enraptured
Lord
Derwentwater
when
he
first
heard
it
.
<EOS>
Very
different
in
style
,
but
equally
effective
in
their
way
,
were
some
simple
ditties
sung
with
great
taste
and
feeling
by
Dorothy
Forster
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
intimated
,
the
prince
was
in
a
very
gay
humour
and
seemed
to
take
no
thought
of
the
morrow
—
though
that
morrow
had
much
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
talked
lightly
with
Anna
and
Dorothy
,
laughed
and
jested
with
Sir
John
Webb
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
and
Forster
,
but
he
talked
seriously
with
no
one
.
<EOS>
So
passed
his
last
night
at
Dilston
Castle
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVA
General
DepartureA
BRIGHT
day
dawned
on
Dilston
.
<EOS>
Fair
looked
the
garden
with
its
lawn
and
terrace
,
inviting
those
within
the
mansion
to
stroll
forth
and
enjoy
the
freshness
of
the
morn
.
<EOS>
So
calm
and
still
was
all
around
that
the
rippling
of
the
hidden
burn
could
be
distinctly
heard
in
the
deep
glen
.
<EOS>
Within
the
park
,
beyond
the
old
grey
bridge
that
linked
it
with
the
grounds
,
the
deer
could
be
seen
couched
beneath
the
oaks
.
<EOS>
The
neighbouring
woods
,
the
dark
moorland
in
the
distance
,
over
which
hung
a
thin
mist
,
the
river
glistening
here
and
there
through
the
trees
—
all
completed
a
picture
which
was
seen
by
more
than
one
of
the
earl
's
guests
,
and
often
recalled
by
them
.
<EOS>
The
prince
was
amongst
those
who
brushed
the
dew
from
the
lawn
,
and
gazed
at
the
charming
prospect
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
attended
matins
in
the
little
chapel
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
returning
from
the
service
with
Lord
Derwentwater
,
he
met
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
and
was
struck
by
the
grave
expression
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
"Good
morrow
,
colonel
,
"
he
said
,
returning
the
other
's
military
salute
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
from
your
looks
,
that
you
have
some
bad
news
to
give
me
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
I
have
to
tell
your
majesty
demands
instant
consideration
and
decision
,
"
replied
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
By
some
means
or
other
,
your
arrival
has
been
discovered
by
Sir
William
Lorraine
,
the
high
sheriff
of
the
county
,
and
yesterday
afternoon
he
sent
a
spy
here
to
make
sure
that
he
had
not
been
misinformed
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
was
suspected
and
locked
up
for
the
night
,
but
it
was
only
this
morning
that
I
forced
him
by
threats
to
confess
his
errand
.
<EOS>
It
is
certain
from
what
he
says
that
the
sheriff
will
come
here
with
a
strong
party
of
men
to
secure
your
majesty
's
person
.
<EOS>
"Lord
Derwentwater
looked
aghast
at
this
startling
intelligence
,
but
the
prince
did
not
seem
much
disturbed
by
it
.
<EOS>
"Instant
<EOS>
measures
must
be
taken
for
the
defence
of
the
place
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"It
can
not
be
defended
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
His
majesty
must
not
remain
here
.
<EOS>
""Do
you
counsel
flight
,
colonel
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"Not
flight
—
but
a
retreat
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
need
to
fly
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
undertake
to
conceal
his
majesty
from
any
search
that
can
be
made
for
him
.
<EOS>
""Better
<EOS>
he
should
seek
shelter
in
some
fortified
house
or
castle
,
"
observed
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
where
?
"
demanded
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
Where
would
you
have
me
go?""If
<EOS>
your
majesty
will
not
remain
here
,
and
trust
yourself
to
me
,
I
advise
you
to
go
to
Bamborough
Castle
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"But
is
Forster
to
be
relied
on
?
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
thoroughly
loyal?""I'll
answer
for
him
with
my
life
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
will
I
,
my
liege
,
"
added
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
'll
trust
him
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
I
acquaint
him
with
your
majesty
's
determination
?
"
inquired
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
No
time
must
be
lost
.
<EOS>
""I'll
go
to
him
,
myself
,
"
rejoined
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
here
he
comes
!
"
exclaimed
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
Forster
was
seen
descending
the
steps
with
Sir
John
Webb
,
and
immediately
obeyed
a
summons
given
him
by
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
much
alarmed
as
the
others
when
he
learnt
the
prince
's
jeopardy
,
and
before
his
highness
signified
his
intention
,
offered
him
an
asylum
at
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
decided
that
the
prince
's
departure
should
take
place
forthwith
,
and
it
was
likewise
arranged
that
Lord
Derwentwater
with
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
his
troop
should
escort
his
highness
.
<EOS>
Some
further
arrangements
were
subsequently
made
,
but
these
were
sufficient
in
the
meantime
,
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
Forster
hurried
off
to
the
stables
to
give
directions
about
the
horses
,
while
the
prince
and
Lord
Derwentwater
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
prince
's
intended
departure
became
known
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
The
news
was
quickly
communicated
to
the
ladies
,
who
very
soon
came
down
-
stairs
,
and
another
consultation
was
held
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
Anna
and
Dorothy
were
determined
not
to
be
left
behind
.
<EOS>
Since
the
prince
was
going
to
Bamborough
,
and
Lord
Derwentwater
,
and
almost
everybody
else
were
going
with
him
,
they
would
go
too
.
<EOS>
Both
were
such
perfect
equestrians
that
they
could
be
trusted
to
keep
up
with
the
fugitives
,
while
their
spirit
was
equal
to
any
unforeseen
difficulty
or
danger
that
might
arise
.
<EOS>
So
the
proposition
was
acceded
to
.
<EOS>
Then
came
a
suggestion
from
Lady
Webb
,
to
the
effect
that
she
and
Sir
John
should
drive
back
to
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
This
was
likewise
adopted
.
<EOS>
Preparations
for
a
general
start
were
then
made
at
once
.
<EOS>
Trunks
and
valises
were
packed
up
.
<EOS>
Riding
-
dresses
donned
,
horses
brought
round
,
Sir
John
Webb
's
carriage
got
ready
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
prince
and
a
large
party
consisting
of
Lord
Derwentwater
and
his
betrothed
,
Tom
Forster
and
his
fair
sister
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
his
companions
,
were
speeding
down
the
chestnut
avenue
,
with
the
intent
of
shaping
their
course
to
Bamborough
Castle
,
which
they
hoped
to
reach
before
night
.
<EOS>
Some
quarter
of
an
hour
later
,
Sir
John
Webb
's
great
lumbering
coach
took
the
same
route
.
<EOS>
Charles
Radclyffe
was
left
in
charge
of
Dilston
,
and
empowered
to
act
as
he
deemed
best
,
in
his
brother
's
absence
.
<EOS>
Hedgeley
,
the
spy
,
was
detained
for
some
time
after
the
prince
's
departure
,
and
then
liberated
.

BAMBOROUGH
CASTLECHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
High
SheriffABOUT
ten
o'clock
on
the
same
day
,
the
high
sheriff
,
accompanied
by
a
score
of
well
-
mounted
yeomen
,
armed
with
various
weapons
,
arrived
at
Dilston
Castle
.
<EOS>
The
gate
was
open
,
and
without
saying
a
word
to
the
porter
,
he
rode
into
the
court
,
followed
by
Jesmond
and
a
groom
,
leaving
the
yeomen
on
guard
outside
.
<EOS>
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
was
standing
at
the
entrance
of
the
mansion
,
came
down
the
steps
to
meet
him
,
and
a
formal
salutation
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
be
surprised
at
my
visit
,
Mr.
Radclyffe
,
"
said
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
in
the
execution
of
a
painful
duty
,
and
desire
to
discharge
it
as
lightly
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
Be
pleased
to
tell
your
brother
,
Lord
Derwentwater
,
that
a
certain
important
person
,
whom
I
am
aware
is
his
guest
,
must
be
delivered
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
reply
to
your
demand
,
Sir
William
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Charles
Radclyffe
,
firmly
,
"
I
have
to
inform
you
that
there
are
no
guests
in
the
castle
,
and
that
Lord
Derwentwater
himself
is
absent
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
sheriff
looked
confounded
,
and
consulted
Jesmond
by
a
glance
.
<EOS>
The
latter
shook
his
head
to
intimate
that
the
assertion
ought
not
to
be
credited
.
<EOS>
"Excuse
<EOS>
me
,
Mr.
Radclyffe
,
"
said
the
sheriff
,
"
I
can
understand
that
you
consider
yourself
justified
in
denying
that
the
Pretender
is
here
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
proof
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
This
man
beheld
him
yesterday
.
<EOS>
""I
saw
him
in
your
company
,
Mr.
Radclyffe
,
"
said
Jesmond
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
you
and
several
others
address
him
as
your
majesty
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
have
you
to
say
to
this
,
sir
?
"
said
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"I
might
say
that
the
man
is
mistaken
,
but
I
will
not
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
content
myself
with
stating
that
the
person
he
beheld
,
and
whom
he
fancied
was
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
is
gone
.
<EOS>
""This
will
be
vexatious
,
if
it
should
turn
out
correct
,
"
muttered
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
believe
it
,
Sir
William
,
"
cried
Jesmond
.
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
,
we
shall
find
him
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
given
you
my
positive
assurance
,
which
ought
to
be
sufficient
,
Sir
William
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
still
entertain
any
doubts
,
pray
search
the
house
—
question
the
servants
—
take
any
steps
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
""I
intend
to
do
so
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
sheriff
,
dismounting
,
and
giving
his
horse
to
the
groom
.
<EOS>
Jesmond
likewise
dismounted
,
and
followed
him
.
<EOS>
On
the
steps
the
sheriff
encountered
Newbiggin
,
and
some
others
of
the
servants
,
who
corroborated
Charles
Radclyffe
's
assertions
;
and
in
the
entrance
hall
he
found
Father
Norman
,
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
,
and
whom
he
respectfully
saluted
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
reverence
knows
my
business
,
"
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
aid
me?""You
can
not
expect
me
to
do
so
,
Sir
William
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
tell
you
frankly
,
that
no
one
is
concealed
here
.
<EOS>
""Has
<EOS>
the
Pretender
fled
?
"
demanded
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Pretender
has
never
been
here
,
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
""This
is
mere
equivocation
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
trifled
with
.
<EOS>
I
will
search
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
,
but
I
will
find
him
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
Attended
by
the
butler
,
and
assisted
by
Jesmond
,
he
then
went
up
-
stairs
,
and
peered
into
a
great
many
rooms
,
but
soon
gave
up
the
fruitless
search
.
<EOS>
"I
told
you
how
it
would
be
,
Sir
William
,
"
observed
the
priest
,
amused
by
his
discomfited
air
,
as
he
returned
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
large
house
,
and
if
you
were
to
search
every
room
in
it
you
would
find
it
a
tedious
business
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
I
tell
you
the
person
you
seek
is
not
here
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
tell
me
whither
<EOS>
he
is
gone?""No
;
you
must
find
that
out
for
yourself
,
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
You
will
act
wisely
if
you
abandon
the
quest
altogether
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
-
no
!
<EOS>
that
must
not
be
,
"
cried
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"Certainly
<EOS>
not
,
Sir
William
,
"
said
Jesmond
.
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
to
make
further
investigations
.
<EOS>
I
warrant
you
I
'll
discover
something
.
"Receiving
<EOS>
permission
to
do
as
he
pleased
<EOS>
,
Jesmond
proceeded
to
the
stables
,
and
in
about
ten
minutes
came
back
to
the
sheriff
,
whom
he
found
in
the
court-
yard
.
<EOS>
The
smile
on
his
countenance
betokened
success
.
<EOS>
"I've
found
it
all
out
,
Sir
William
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
A
large
party
on
horseback
left
this
morning
—
but
the
Pretender
was
not
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
he
is
here
,
still?""No
,
Sir
William
;
he
went
away
in
Sir
John
Webb
's
coach
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
a
coach!—then
we
may
overtake
him!""Undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
is
large
and
heavy
,
and
does
n't
travel
more
than
three
or
four
miles
an
hour
.
<EOS>
We
shall
catch
him
before
he
gets
to
Morpeth
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
he
gone
in
that
direction?""He
<EOS>
is
,
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
'd
find
out
something
,
and
you
must
own
that
I
've
managed
to
put
you
on
the
right
scent
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
,
"
cried
the
sheriff
,
jumping
on
his
horse
.
"
<EOS>
Follow
me
,
gentlemen
!
—
<EOS>
follow
me!"—he
called
out
to
the
yeomen
,
who
had
been
waiting
all
this
time
outside
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Next
minute
they
were
rattling
down
the
avenue
,
with
the
sheriff
at
their
head
.
<EOS>
We
may
be
sure
Jesmond
was
not
left
behind
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIPursuitON
arriving
at
Corbridge
,
the
sheriff
found
that
the
carriage
had
taken
the
high
road
to
Newcastle
,
the
cross
-
road
by
Whittingham
and
Stamfordham
being
impracticable
,
and
accordingly
he
and
his
troop
galloped
off
in
that
direction
;
but
when
they
reached
the
extensive
moor
that
skirts
the
town
,
they
discovered
that
a
deviation
from
the
direct
course
had
been
made
on
the
left
,
and
that
the
travellers
had
crossed
,
or
attempted
to
cross
the
moor
to
Gosforth
.
<EOS>
The
road
chosen
was
so
bad
,
that
it
seemed
almost
certain
the
carriage
would
be
found
buried
up
to
the
axle
-
tree
in
a
bog
,
and
with
that
confident
expectation
the
pursuers
took
the
same
route
.
<EOS>
From
appearances
on
the
road
,
it
was
sufficiently
clear
that
the
heavy
vehicle
had
been
more
than
once
partially
engulfed
,
and
could
only
have
been
extricated
with
difficulty
—
but
it
had
reached
firm
ground
at
last
,
and
had
gone
on
to
Gosforth
.
<EOS>
About
three
miles
further
on
the
pursuers
descried
it
slowly
rumbling
on
towards
Blagdon
Park
.
<EOS>
Cheered
by
the
sight
,
they
accelerated
their
pace
,
and
shouting
loudly
as
they
went
on
,
soon
caused
the
carriage
to
stop
.
<EOS>
Anxious
to
make
the
intended
arrest
without
any
appearance
of
violence
,
the
sheriff
ordered
a
halt
of
his
followers
,
and
rode
up
to
the
carriage
,
attended
merely
by
Jesmond
.
<EOS>
Lady
Webb
and
the
two
women
-
servants
inside
had
been
greatly
alarmed
by
the
shouting
of
the
pursuers
and
sudden
stoppage
of
the
vehicle
,
and
Sir
John
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Just
then
the
sheriff
came
up
,
and
saluting
him
formally
explained
his
business
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
replied
rather
angrily
,
and
declared
in
positive
terms
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
carriage
beside
himself
and
Lady
Webb
and
their
two
women
-
servants
.
<EOS>
As
the
sheriff
expressed
a
doubt
,
Sir
John
called
to
his
man
-
servant
to
come
down
and
open
the
door
,
and
immediately
got
out
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
,
Sir
William
—
pray
satisfy
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"I
must
trouble
Lady
Webb
to
alight
—
and
the
two
women
,
"
said
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
The
injunction
was
obeyed
by
her
ladyship
,
though
not
without
strong
expressions
of
displeasure
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
had
all
come
forth
,
Jesmond
got
into
the
carriage
,
and
looked
under
the
seats
,
but
found
only
trunks
and
boxes
.
<EOS>
As
he
emerged
with
a
crestfallen
look
,
he
was
jeered
by
Sir
John
and
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
The
sheriff
,
too
,
blamed
him
for
the
blunder
he
had
made
.
<EOS>
"I
am
certain
the
Pretender
is
in
the
carriage
,
Sir
William
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"Then
find
him
,
"
cried
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
find
him
,
fellow
,
if
you
can
,
"
added
Sir
John
,
derisively
.
<EOS>
"He
is
here
,
"
cried
Jesmond
,
pointing
to
the
footman
,
a
tall
,
handsome
young
man
.
<EOS>
An
exclamation
from
Sir
John
was
checked
by
her
ladyship
,
who
made
a
private
sign
to
the
footman
to
hold
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
"You
are
not
making
a
second
blunder
,
I
trust
?
"
said
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
no
!
<EOS>
rest
easy
,
Sir
William
!
<EOS>
All
right
now
!
<EOS>
I
did
n't
recognise
him
at
first
in
his
disguise
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
'll
swear
to
him
.
<EOS>
""You
will
swear
that
I
am
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
whom
you
call
the
Pretender
?
"
cried
the
footman
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
,
"
said
Jesmond
.
<EOS>
Again
Sir
John
would
have
interfered
,
if
a
look
from
her
ladyship
had
not
kept
him
quiet
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
need
have
no
hesitation
,
Sir
William
,
"
said
Jesmond
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
all
consequences
on
my
own
head
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
your
head
is
nothing
,
"
rejoined
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
consideration
,
he
told
Sir
John
Webb
he
must
turn
back
,
and
accompany
him
to
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
protested
vehemently
against
the
order
,
and
declared
it
would
put
him
to
the
greatest
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
help
that
,
"
said
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"
I
own
I
am
somewhat
perplexed
,
but
a
great
responsibility
rests
with
me
,
and
I
am
afraid
of
committing
an
error
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
warn
you
that
you
will
commit
a
very
great
error
indeed
,
if
you
take
me
to
Newcastle
,
"
said
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"We
are
wasting
time
here
,
"
cried
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
will
be
pleased
to
re
-
enter
the
carriage
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
polite
,
but
authoritative
tone
to
Lady
<EOS>
Webb—"and
you
,
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
women
servants
followed
,
and
the
footman
was
about
to
shut
the
door
,
when
the
sheriff
told
him
he
must
get
in
likewise
.
<EOS>
Finding
Sir
John
was
about
to
resist
the
intrusion
,
Jesmond
pushed
the
young
man
in
,
vociferating
in
a
mocking
voice:"Room
for
his
majesty
,
King
James
the
Third!"Irritated
to
the
last
point
,
Sir
John
would
certainly
have
resented
the
insult
if
Lady
Webb
had
not
held
him
fast
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
however
,
prevent
him
from
putting
his
head
from
the
window
,
and
shouting
out
to
the
sheriff:"Where
is
this
farce
to
end
,
Sir
William?""Most
likely
at
the
Tower
of
London
,
"
was
the
sarcastic
reply
.
<EOS>
"Make
<EOS>
no
rejoinder
,
Sir
John
,
"
said
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
the
laugh
against
him
by
-
and
-
bye
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
coach
was
then
turned
round
,
and
guarded
by
the
troop
of
yeomen
,
proceeded
slowly
towards
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIILord
WiddringtonVERY
different
was
the
progress
of
the
prince
and
his
party
from
that
made
by
the
occupants
of
the
coach
.
<EOS>
While
the
latter
were
crawling
along
the
highway
,
the
others
were
flying
across
the
country
,
as
if
chasing
the
deer
.
<EOS>
Over
broad
wide
moors
they
speeded
—
across
valley
,
and
through
wood
—
past
ancient
castles
,
and
along
the
banks
of
rushing
streams
—
allowing
nothing
to
stop
them
—
not
even
the
Picts
'
wall
,
through
a
gap
in
which
they
dashed
—
till
after
traversing
many
a
wild
and
waste
such
as
only
can
be
seen
in
Northumberland
,
they
came
in
sight
of
the
great
German
Ocean
,
and
the
rugged
coast
that
bounds
it
.
<EOS>
Sixteen
miles
and
upwards
had
been
accomplished
in
a
marvellously
short
space
of
time
,
but
then
all
were
well
mounted
.
<EOS>
Throughout
this
long
stretch
,
Anna
,
who
we
have
said
rode
splendidly
,
kept
by
the
side
of
Lord
Derwentwater
,
and
as
he
led
the
way
,
she
shared
any
risk
he
might
run
.
<EOS>
A
pretty
sight
<EOS>
it
was
to
see
them
together
,
and
drew
forth
the
admiration
of
those
who
followed
in
their
course
.
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
,
they
got
ahead
,
and
the
Prince
and
Dorothy
Forster
,
who
were
next
behind
,
made
no
effort
to
come
up
with
them
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
party
kept
well
together
.
<EOS>
At
length
a
point
was
reached
from
which
,
as
we
have
just
mentioned
,
the
broad
expanse
of
the
ocean
could
be
surveyed
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
was
Camboise
Bay
,
spreading
out
with
all
its
rocky
headlands
as
far
as
Tynemouth
and
South
Shields
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
was
Druridge
Bay
with
Coquet
Island
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
a
few
miles
off
was
Morpeth
,
with
the
ruins
of
its
castle
,
and
its
old
church
,
and
beyond
Morpeth
lay
the
wild
district
they
had
traversed
.
<EOS>
As
yet
they
had
made
no
halt
,
Lord
Derwentwater
's
intention
being
to
stop
at
Widdrington
Castle
,
which
could
now
be
descried
about
a
mile
off
,
beautifully
situated
near
the
coast
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
picturesque
structure
,
surrounded
by
fine
timber
,
and
though
of
great
antiquity
,
seemed
in
excellent
repair
.
<EOS>
Lord
Widdrington
was
a
devoted
partisan
of
the
House
of
Stuart
,
and
it
was
therefore
certain
that
his
castle
would
be
thrown
open
to
the
prince
,
and
that
his
highness
might
tarry
there
as
long
as
he
pleased
if
he
deemed
it
as
safe
as
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
After
contemplating
the
fine
old
structure
with
delight
for
a
few
minutes
,
the
prince
moved
on
,
and
followed
by
the
whole
party
rode
down
the
eminence
,
and
entered
the
park
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
gone
far
,
when
they
met
the
noble
owner
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Lord
Widdrington
chanced
to
be
riding
about
his
grounds
at
the
time
,
and
seeing
the
party
enter
the
lodge
-
gate
,
he
hastened
towards
them
.
<EOS>
How
great
was
his
astonishment
when
he
learnt
who
was
his
visitor
!
<EOS>
He
instantly
flung
himself
from
his
horse
to
pay
homage
to
him
whom
he
regarded
as
his
king
.
<EOS>
But
the
prince
was
as
quick
as
himself
,
and
anticipating
his
design
,
dismounted
and
embraced
him
,
expressing
the
greatest
delight
at
beholding
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
Widdrington
had
quite
the
air
of
a
country
gentleman
.
<EOS>
About
five
-
and-
thirty
,
he
was
well
-
made
,
though
somewhat
robust
,
with
good
features
,
lighted
up
by
grey
eyes
,
and
characterised
by
a
frank
,
manly
expression
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
blue
riding
-
dress
trimmed
with
silver
,
a
blonde
peruke
and
riding
-
boots
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Lord
Derwentwater
had
come
up
,
and
explanations
were
quickly
given
as
to
the
position
in
which
the
prince
was
placed
.
<EOS>
Lord
Widdrington
looked
grave
,
and
after
a
few
moments
'
deliberation
said:"Your
majesty
must
be
certain
that
nothing
would
gratify
me
more
than
to
receive
you
as
my
guest
,
but
your
safety
is
the
first
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
am
bound
,
therefore
,
to
state
<EOS>
,
that
in
case
of
pursuit
,
you
would
not
be
as
safe
here
as
at
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
""Such
is
my
own
opinion
,
"
remarked
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
are
a
hundred
hiding
-
places
in
the
old
castle
,
"
pursued
Lord
Widdrington
;
"
and
besides
,
a
boat
can
be
always
in
readiness
,
so
that
your
majesty
could
be
taken
to
Lindisfarne
,
where
you
might
be
concealed
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
""Whatever
<EOS>
course
you
advise
,
<EOS>
my
lord
,
I
will
adopt
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
not
be
deprived
of
the
power
of
retreat
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
therein
especially
that
Bamborough
has
the
advantage
over
this
mansion
,
my
liege
,
"
said
Forster
,
who
had
come
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
with
my
life
that
you
shall
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
your
enemies
.
<EOS>
""And
I
dare
not
assert
as
much
,
since
I
might
not
be
able
to
make
good
my
words
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"That
decides
me
,
"
cried
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
up
my
quarters
at
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
trust
your
majesty
will
tarry
awhile
,
and
accept
such
hospitality
as
I
am
able
to
offer
you
,
"
entreated
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
say
you
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
prince
,
appealing
to
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
stay
?
<EOS>
I
am
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
lordship
thought
an
hour
's
halt
might
be
risked
,
so
the
whole
of
the
party
dismounted
,
and
were
conducted
to
a
large
antique
dining
-
hall
,
adorned
with
portraits
of
the
family
,
commencing
with
Gerard
de
Widdrington
,
who
flourished
in
the
time
of
Edward
the
Third
.
<EOS>
Here
a
goodly
repast
was
served
with
remarkable
promptitude
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
viands
were
cold
,
but
those
who
partook
of
them
were
too
hungry
to
care
for
that
—
for
they
had
breakfasted
but
slightly
before
starting,—and
even
the
two
fair
damsels
had
gained
a
good
appetite
by
the
ride
.
<EOS>
Claret
there
was
in
abundance
,
and
a
goblet
was
devoted
to
a
young
pair
of
whose
recent
betrothal
Lord
Widdrington
had
just
heard
.
<EOS>
The
health
of
King
James
was
drunk
at
the
close
of
the
repast
,
which
was
not
prolonged
beyond
an
hour
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
that
time
the
horses
were
brought
round
.
<EOS>
After
glancing
round
the
entrance
-
hall
,
which
was
panelled
with
oak
,
and
decked
with
trophies
of
the
chase
and
ancient
weapons
,
and
admiring
the
carved
oak
staircase
,
the
prince
went
forth
,
and
mounted
his
steed
—
Lord
Widdrington
holding
the
bridle
.
<EOS>
With
graceful
gallantry
,
his
lordship
next
assisted
the
two
fair
equestrians
to
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
mounted
his
own
horse
,
with
the
purpose
of
attending
the
prince
to
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
ordered
half
a
dozen
well
-
armed
men
to
follow
at
the
rear
of
the
troop
.
<EOS>
With
this
additional
force
the
party
proceeded
on
its
way
—
though
not
at
the
same
rapid
pace
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVDunstanborough
CastleNO
longer
feeling
any
uneasiness
,
the
prince
greatly
enjoyed
the
ride
along
this
remarkable
coast
,
which
,
besides
being
studded
with
ancient
castles
,
commands
unequalled
sea
-
views
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
fine
,
with
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
from
the
North
Sea
.
<EOS>
Many
vessels
were
in
sight
,
giving
life
to
the
picture
.
<EOS>
Before
them
lay
Warkworth
Castle
,
finely
situated
on
a
peninsula
,
at
the
mouth
of
the
lovely
river
Coquet
,
and
the
sight
of
the
tall
grey
towers
of
this
imposing
structure
so
full
of
historical
recollections
,
greatly
moved
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"From
that
proud
castle
of
the
Percys
I
should
like
to
be
proclaimed
,
"
he
cried
aloud
.
<EOS>
"Your
wish
shall
be
gratified
,
my
liege
,
that
we
promise
you
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Widdrington
and
Mr.
Forster
,
who
overheard
the
exclamation
.
<EOS>
And
they
fulfilled
their
promise
,
but
not
till
a
later
date
.
<EOS>
An
ancient
stone
bridge
across
the
Coquet
brought
the
prince
in
front
of
the
castle
,
and
he
paused
for
a
few
minutes
to
gaze
at
it
.
<EOS>
Fain
would
he
have
visited
the
Hermitage
,
but
the
wish
could
not
be
gratified
,
and
he
rode
on
through
the
little
town
.
<EOS>
No
interference
was
offered
to
the
party
since
Lord
Widdrington
and
Mr.
Forster
were
at
its
head
.
<EOS>
To
Warkworth
quickly
succeeded
a
still
finer
castle
—
Alnwick
;
and
the
prince
was
again
lost
in
admiration
of
the
second
magnificent
feudal
structure
reared
on
a
height
above
the
town
,
and
lording
it
over
the
surrounding
country
.
<EOS>
Guessing
his
highness
's
thoughts
,
Lord
Widdrington
said:"Had
<EOS>
your
majesty
<EOS>
these
two
castles
,
with
Dunstanborough
and
Bamborough
,
and
all
four
well
garrisoned
,
you
might
hold
your
own
till
an
army
could
be
raised
,
that
should
win
you
your
kingdom
.
<EOS>
""Bamborough
is
yours
already
,
my
liege
,
"
added
Forster
.
"
<EOS>
And
doubt
not
the
others
will
be
gained
.
<EOS>
"Several
<EOS>
fresh
objects
interested
the
prince
as
he
rode
on
.
<EOS>
Amongst
them
was
Howick
Tower
,
now
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
Dunstanborough
Castle
could
be
descried
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
As
the
prince
advanced
,
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
the
enormous
pile
was
in
ruins
,
but
it
still
looked
strong
,
and
its
position
on
a
ridge
of
rocks
overlooking
the
sea
was
strikingly
grand
.
<EOS>
Several
towers
and
a
large
portion
of
the
walls
were
left
;
but
that
the
castle
could
be
rendered
capable
of
defence
seemed
very
doubtful
to
the
prince
,
though
both
Lord
Widdrington
and
Mr.
Forster
were
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
your
majesty
had
time
to
inspect
the
stronghold
,
I
would
convince
you
of
its
importance
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
Ruined
as
it
is
,
it
is
so
immensely
strong
that
I
would
undertake
to
hold
it
for
a
month
,
and
with
a
few
large
guns
it
would
command
the
sea
.
<EOS>
""There
are
some
extraordinary
caverns
beneath
the
castle
,
where
any
amount
of
arms
and
ammunition
sent
from
France
could
be
stored
,
"
observed
Forster
.
<EOS>
"Obtain
possession
of
the
place
as
soon
as
you
can
,
"
remarked
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
It
ought
to
belong
to
us
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
belong
to
your
majesty
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
During
the
ride
along
the
coast
,
Lord
Derwentwater
had
not
deemed
it
necessary
to
pay
especial
attention
to
the
prince
,
since
Lord
Widdrington
was
better
able
than
himself
to
furnish
any
information
his
highness
might
require
.
<EOS>
The
enamoured
earl
,
therefore
,
felt
at
liberty
to
devote
himself
exclusively
to
the
object
of
his
affections
.
<EOS>
To
enjoy
greater
freedom
,
the
young
pair
separated
themselves
from
the
troop
,
and
pursued
their
course
along
the
turf
that
skirted
the
road
—
halting
,
occasionally
,
to
gaze
at
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Attracted
by
Dunstanborough
Castle
,
they
galloped
towards
the
grand
old
ruin
,
and
after
a
brief
survey
of
the
gateway
and
towers
were
hastening
back
across
the
plain
,
when
Anna
's
horse
stumbled
and
fell
.
<EOS>
Before
the
earl
could
dismount
and
come
to
her
assistance
,
she
had
regained
her
feet
,
but
her
horse
had
sprained
his
shoulder
so
badly
that
he
could
scarcely
move
.
<EOS>
Deeming
it
the
best
thing
that
could
be
done
,
Lord
Derwentwater
proposed
to
ride
as
quickly
as
he
could
after
the
party
,
and
bring
back
another
horse
for
her
.
<EOS>
"Dare
<EOS>
you
remain
here
alone
till
I
return
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
am
not
in
the
slightest
degree
afraid
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
not
be
away
many
minutes
,
"
he
cried
,
dashing
off
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
party
had
disappeared
,
but
he
soon
overtook
them
,
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
returned
with
one
of
Lord
Widdrington
's
grooms
.
<EOS>
But
Anna
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
The
poor
disabled
horse
had
never
stirred
from
the
spot
.
<EOS>
But
its
mistress
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
gazed
anxiously
in
every
direction
,
but
could
see
nothing
of
her
.
<EOS>
Thinking
she
might
have
gone
to
the
castle
,
he
hurried
thither
,
followed
by
the
groom
,
dashed
through
the
gateway
,
and
through
an
inner
gate
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
Here
he
gazed
distractedly
around
,
but
could
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
any
answer
returned
to
his
cries
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VHow
the
Prince
was
lodged
in
the
old
FortressMEANWHILE
,
the
prince
and
his
attendants
had
proceeded
tranquilly
on
their
way
to
Bamborough
Castle
,
which
is
not
more
than
an
hour
's
ride
from
Dunstanborough
.
<EOS>
But
nearly
double
that
time
was
consumed
on
the
present
occasion
,
for
the
prince
made
several
halts
,
being
greatly
struck
by
the
imposing
aspect
and
commanding
position
of
the
old
stronghold
.
<EOS>
No
uneasiness
was
felt
at
the
non
-
appearance
of
the
earl
and
his
betrothed
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
an
accident
had
befallen
the
young
lady
's
horse
—
and
all
were
aware
that
a
groom
had
gone
back
with
his
lordship
to
Dunstanborough
—
but
no
importance
was
attached
to
this
circumstance
.
<EOS>
On
his
arrival
at
Bamborough
the
prince
was
ceremoniously
received
by
Mr.
Forster
who
had
ridden
on
in
advance
with
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
He
was
first
ushered
into
the
hall
of
the
modern
mansion
which
was
thronged
with
servants
,
who
bowed
reverently
as
he
appeared
,
and
everything
looked
so
cheerful
and
comfortable
,
and
so
like
the
abode
of
a
country
squire
—
all
the
doors
were
wide
open
—
there
were
so
many
dogs
about
—
and
such
an
air
of
free
and
easy
hospitality
pervaded
the
place
—
that
he
would
fain
have
taken
up
his
quarters
there
,
had
it
been
judged
prudent
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
Forster
would
have
readily
acceded
to
his
highness
's
wishes
,
and
have
assigned
him
the
best
rooms
in
the
mansion
,
but
Lord
Widdrington
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
declared
that
he
must
be
lodged
in
the
old
castle
.
<EOS>
There
he
might
sleep
in
security
—
surrounded
by
lofty
walls
,
and
protected
by
strong
gates
.
<EOS>
In
the
daytime
there
was
comparatively
little
danger
.
<EOS>
Quite
reconciled
to
the
arrangement
,
the
prince
was
shortly
afterwards
conducted
by
his
host
to
the
lower
ward
of
the
castle
,
and
thence
to
one
of
the
towers
,
the
chambers
within
which
were
comfortably
furnished
,
and
with
this
accommodation
he
was
very
well
content
.
<EOS>
As
a
guard
to
his
highness
,
it
was
next
arranged
that
Colonel
Oxburgh
should
occupy
the
lower
chamber
of
the
same
tower
,
and
that
the
adjoining
fortifications
should
be
tenanted
by
Captain
Wogan
and
the
rest
of
the
troop
,
together
with
some
of
Mr.
Forster
's
retainers
on
whose
courage
and
fidelity
perfect
reliance
could
be
placed
.
<EOS>
These
arrangements
made
,
the
prince
walked
round
the
walls
of
the
castle
,
attended
by
his
host
,
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
and
was
greatly
struck
by
the
strength
of
its
position
.
<EOS>
Though
the
sea
was
tolerably
calm
,
the
waves
came
dashing
against
the
precipitous
rock
on
which
the
edifice
was
reared
.
<EOS>
The
Farne
Islands
looked
close
at
hand
,
and
Holy
Island
could
be
seen
looming
in
the
distance
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
Turning
from
the
sea
,
the
prince
contemplated
for
awhile
the
square
massive
keep
,
and
then
descended
to
the
court
.
<EOS>
Here
they
were
met
by
the
butler
,
who
brought
the
welcome
intelligence
that
dinner
was
served
.
<EOS>
Though
it
was
judged
expedient
that
the
prince
should
lodge
within
the
castle
,
it
was
not
thought
necessary
that
he
should
dine
there
.
<EOS>
"If
I
am
not
able
to
entertain
your
majesty
as
well
as
I
could
desire
,
"
said
Mr.
Forster
,
"
I
trust
you
will
excuse
me
on
the
ground
that
I
have
had
little
time
for
preparation
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
give
you
a
banquet
such
as
we
partook
of
yesterday
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
""Make
<EOS>
no
apologies
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
epicure
,
and
care
not
how
plain
the
fare
may
be
.
<EOS>
Apropos
of
the
feast
of
yesterday
!
<EOS>
where
is
Lord
Derwentwater?"Mr
.
<EOS>
Forster
could
not
answer
the
question
,
but
the
butler
being
applied
to
,
said
that
neither
his
lordship
nor
the
young
lady
with
him
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
"This
is
strange
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
majesty
need
not
feel
uneasy
,
"
laughed
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
be
here
presently
.
<EOS>
Is
it
your
pleasure
to
wait
dinner
for
them?"His
highness
did
not
deem
that
necessary
,
but
thought
some
one
ought
to
go
in
quest
of
them
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
will
I
,
"
cried
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
And
hieing
at
once
to
the
stable
,
he
called
for
his
horse
,
and
attended
by
a
couple
of
grooms
,
set
off
towards
Dunstanborough
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIAnna
's
Adventure
in
the
CavernHE
had
got
more
than
half
way
<EOS>
thither
,
when
he
thought
he
descried
them
in
the
distance
,
but
as
night
was
now
coming
on
,
he
did
not
feel
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
,
however
,
all
doubts
were
removed
.
<EOS>
The
persons
he
beheld
were
Lord
Derwentwater
and
his
betrothed
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
the
parties
met
,
and
Lord
Widdrington
exclaimed:"I
am
greatly
rejoiced
to
see
both
of
you
safe
and
sound
,
for
we
began
to
fear
that
something
must
have
happened
.
<EOS>
""Something
very
extraordinary
has
happened
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
lordship
will
scarcely
credit
me
when
I
tell
you
that
I
have
been
lost
in
a
cavern
underneath
Dunstanborough
Castle
,
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"Lost
in
a
cavern
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Lord
Widdrington
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
came
that
to
pass?""You
shall
hear
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
left
by
myself
for
a
short
time
near
the
castle
—
Lord
Derwentwater
having
ridden
off
to
bring
me
another
horse
,
my
own
having
got
injured
by
a
fall
—
when
I
thought
I
would
take
a
peep
at
the
ruins
which
were
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Foolishly
acting
upon
the
impulse
,
I
flew
thither
—
meaning
to
get
back
in
a
few
minutes
—
and
never
stopped
till
I
got
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
After
gazing
at
Queen
Margaret
's
Tower
and
Lilburne
's
Tower
,
I
looked
round
the
walls
,
when
my
eye
fell
upon
a
cavity
at
a
little
distance
from
me
.
<EOS>
Within
the
hollow
was
a
flight
of
steps
,
leading
,
as
I
fancied
,
to
some
vault
or
dungeon
,
and
prompted
by
curiosity
,
I
hastily
descended
them
.
<EOS>
The
steps
brought
me
to
an
arched
passage
,
and
still
under
the
influence
of
curiosity
I
ventured
on
,
and
soon
found
that
other
passages
branched
off
on
the
right
and
left
.
<EOS>
Into
one
of
these
I
turned
and
advanced
a
few
yards
,
and
inadvertently
stepping
forward
—
for
I
could
now
see
nothing
—
slipped
down
a
rapid
descent
,
that
landed
me
in
what
I
knew
to
be
a
spacious
cavern
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
I
was
not
so
much
alarmed
,
because
I
fancied
I
could
extricate
myself
from
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
remount
the
place
down
which
I
had
fallen
,
and
being
now
greatly
frightened
,
I
endeavoured
to
find
another
exit
.
<EOS>
But
the
attempt
was
fruitless
.
<EOS>
My
outstretched
hand
only
encountered
a
wall
of
rock
,
and
I
soon
became
so
perplexed
and
confused
that
I
could
not
even
find
my
way
back
to
the
spot
I
had
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
""A
terrible
position
to
be
placed
in
!
"
exclaimed
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
have
recovered
so
soon
from
the
effects
of
the
fright
.
<EOS>
""I
thought
I
should
have
sunk
at
the
time
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
But
fortunately
my
spirits
supported
me
.
<EOS>
I
addressed
a
prayer
to
Saint
Anna
,
and
then
felt
easier
.
<EOS>
But
deliverance
did
not
come
so
soon
as
I
expected
,
and
there
was
an
interval
of
dreadful
suspense
.
<EOS>
You
seemed
long
—
long
in
coming
,
"
she
added
to
Lord
Derwentwater
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
when
I
heard
your
voice
,
I
knew
I
was
saved
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
your
response
gave
me
new
life
,
"
he
said
;
"
for
hope
was
almost
extinct
within
my
breast
.
<EOS>
That
cavern
was
the
last
place
I
searched
,
for
though
I
had
noticed
the
stone
steps
<EOS>
,
I
never
thought
you
would
venture
down
them
.
<EOS>
""I
can
guess
all
the
rest
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
a
joyful
meeting
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
adventure
was
not
an
agreeable
one
,
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
has
tested
his
lordship
's
affection
for
me
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
promise
to
be
more
careful
in
future
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
you
have
had
a
pretty
good
lesson
,
and
will
do
well
to
profit
by
it
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
unlucky
steed
is
to
blame
for
it
all
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Had
he
not
stumbled
,
nothing
would
have
happened
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
left
him
at
Dunstanborough
,
I
suppose
?
"
observed
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
in
charge
of
your
groom
,
"
she
replied
"
Your
lordship
's
horse
carries
me
capitally
.
<EOS>
""Then
pray
use
him
as
long
as
you
will
!
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
on
,
and
relieve
the
anxiety
of
our
friends
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
they
quickened
their
pace
,
and
made
such
good
way
that
dinner
was
not
quite
over
when
they
reached
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
Great
rejoicing
was
manifested
on
their
appearance
,
and
when
Anna
's
adventure
became
known
,
the
feeling
rose
to
excitement
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
could
not
contain
herself
,
but
springing
from
her
seat
,
rushed
up
to
her
friend
and
embraced
her
.
<EOS>
We
need
scarcely
say
that
under
such
unusual
circumstances
another
health
was
drunk
,
in
addition
to
the
grand
toast
,
which
was
never
omitted
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
claret
was
generally
drunk
at
Mr.
Forster
's
dinners
,
as
we
have
already
remarked
,
and
the
custom
would
probably
not
have
been
neglected
on
the
present
occasion
if
the
prince
had
not
risen
early
from
table
,
and
proceeded
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
there
was
music
and
singing
.
<EOS>
The
prince
retired
early
,
and
proceeded
to
his
lodgings
in
the
old
fortress
,
attended
by
his
host
,
Lord
Derwentwater
,
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
several
others
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
to
be
a
fine
moonlight
night
,
and
the
appearance
of
the
massive
keep
,
partly
lighted
up
by
the
beams
,
partly
in
shadow
,
was
so
striking
,
that
his
highness
remained
for
some
time
contemplating
the
massive
pile
.
<EOS>
He
then
mounted
the
walls
to
gaze
at
the
sea
,
which
was
brilliantly
illumined
—
a
broad
track
of
light
leading
across
its
unruffled
surface
to
the
Farne
Islands
,
and
producing
a
truly
magical
effect
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
able
to
tear
himself
away
from
this
bewitching
scene
,
the
prince
,
at
last
,
bade
his
attendants
good
night
,
and
sought
his
chamber
in
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Though
no
real
danger
was
apprehended
,
unwonted
precautions
were
taken
for
his
security
.
<EOS>
The
gates
were
barred
,
and
watch
was
kept
upon
the
walls
throughout
the
night
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
his
companions
were
prepared
to
act
on
any
sudden
emergency
,
and
the
colonel
had
arranged
his
plans
with
the
two
nobles
,
who
had
likewise
decided
upon
passing
the
night
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIAn
<EOS>
AlarmMORNING
came
,
and
nothing
had
occurred
to
cause
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
prince
slept
soundly
in
the
tower
,
and
was
up
betimes
,
and
on
the
walls
,
enjoying
the
view
,
and
inhaling
the
fresh
sea
-
breeze
.
<EOS>
So
well
pleased
was
he
that
the
thought
that
he
must
speedily
quit
the
castle
pained
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
delude
himself
with
the
idea
,
that
,
strong
as
was
the
fortress
,
it
would
be
possible
to
maintain
it
against
a
regular
attack
.
<EOS>
Flight
,
therefore
,
was
his
only
alternative
.
<EOS>
A
vessel
must
be
procured
to
convey
him
to
France
—
and
this
must
be
accomplished
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Widdrington
joined
him
,
he
made
known
his
wishes
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
both
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
,
but
finding
him
resolved
,
Lord
Widdrington
undertook
to
proceed
forthwith
to
Berwick
-
upon
-
Tweed
,
and
make
all
necessary
arrangements
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
many
friends
at
Berwick
—
some
of
them
partisans
of
your
majesty
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
doubt
not
I
shall
be
able
to
hire
a
small
vessel
to
convey
you
to
Dunkerque
,
but
it
may
perhaps
be
necessary
for
you
to
embark
from
Holy
Island
,
or
the
Farne
Islands
,
but
this
will
depend
,
in
some
measure
,
on
the
master
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
have
succeeded
in
making
an
arrangement
I
will
return
,
and
let
your
majesty
know
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
""I
should
like
to
start
to
-
night
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"That
is
allowing
very
short
time
for
preparation
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
do
my
best
to
carry
out
your
majesty
's
wishes,""I
am
sorry
to
give
your
lordship
so
much
trouble
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
know
you
make
light
of
it
in
your
zealous
desire
to
serve
me
.
<EOS>
""That
is
perfectly
true
,
my
liege
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
regret
that
I
can
not
give
stronger
proof
of
my
devotion
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
your
majesty
would
stay
where
you
are
,
but
since
you
are
determined
to
leave
us
,
I
will
do
my
best
to
expedite
your
departure
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
bent
before
the
prince
,
the
latter
passed
his
arms
affectionately
round
his
neck
and
bade
him
adieu
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
ten
minutes
the
loyal
noble
,
though
greatly
disliking
his
mission
,
was
speeding
along
the
road
to
Berwick
-
upon
-
Tweed
,
followed
by
a
groom
.
<EOS>
The
early
part
of
the
day
passed
without
any
incident
worth
narrating
.
<EOS>
The
prince
did
not
quit
the
castle
,
but
breakfasted
in
his
tower
,
and
later
on
,
visited
the
keep
attended
by
Lord
Derwentwater
and
the
two
young
ladies
,
and
thus
obtained
a
more
perfect
notion
than
he
had
hitherto
formed
of
the
strength
of
King
Ida
's
castle
.
<EOS>
From
the
summit
of
the
lofty
structure
he
looked
down
upon
the
islands
that
studded
the
sea
in
front
of
him
,
and
was
amazed
by
the
multitude
of
sea
-
birds
that
covered
their
rocks
and
precipices
,
and
occasionally
rose
in
clouds
,
uttering
shrieks
and
cries
that
could
be
distinctly
heard
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
The
sea
was
calm
now
,
but
Anna
described
its
terrific
appearance
in
a
storm
when
tremendous
waves
were
dashed
against
those
rocks
,
and
columns
of
spray
were
thrown
up
through
their
fissures
to
a
prodigious
height
.
<EOS>
The
islands
consisted
of
two
groups
,
and
the
more
distant
of
them
seemed
entirely
whitened
by
sea
-
birds
.
<EOS>
The
Home
Island
,
as
the
nearest
of
the
Farne
Islands
is
designated
,
is
not
much
more
than
a
mile
from
the
mainland
,
and
on
that
bright
,
sunshiny
day
looked
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
pointed
out
Prior
Castell
's
Tower
,
which
served
as
a
beacon
.
<EOS>
While
the
prince
was
examining
the
little
bay
almost
shut
in
by
rocks
that
formed
an
entrance
to
the
Home
Island
,
he
observed
a
boat
come
forth
.
<EOS>
It
was
large
and
roomy
,
strongly
built
and
well
calculated
for
a
rough
sea
,
and
seemed
to
contain
a
dozen
men
armed
with
muskets
or
fowling
-
pieces
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
this
boat
and
its
crew
excited
some
misgiving
on
the
part
of
those
who
watched
it
,
especially
when
they
found
it
was
steering
direct
for
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
was
preparing
to
descend
to
the
court
and
give
the
alarm
,
when
the
boat
,
which
had
now
got
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
shore
,
suddenly
changed
its
course
,
and
turned
off
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
Its
movements
were
anxiously
watched
in
the
apprehension
that
the
men
might
be
landed
,
but
it
went
on
,
and
after
rounding
Beadnell
Point
was
lost
to
view
.
<EOS>
The
prince
then
breathed
more
freely
.
<EOS>
"I
thought
those
men
were
about
to
attack
the
castle
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
seems
they
had
no
such
design
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
so
sure
of
that
,
my
liege
,
"
observed
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
evidently
reconnoitring
the
place
,
but
something
caused
them
to
change
their
plans
,
and
steer
off
.
<EOS>
Yet
a
rumour
that
your
majesty
is
here
can
scarcely
have
reached
yonder
remote
island
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
island
is
not
so
remote
as
your
lordship
supposes
,
"
remarked
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
Boats
are
constantly
passing
to
and
fro
over
the
Fairway
,
as
the
strait
is
called
,
and
it
is
highly
probable
the
islanders
have
heard
the
news
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
have
thought
they
were
more
likely
to
aid
his
majesty
than
to
attack
him
.
<EOS>
""They
may
be
stimulated
by
the
hope
of
a
reward
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
But
be
that
as
it
may
,
I
am
glad
they
have
given
up
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
""We
may
have
another
visit
from
them
,
so
it
will
be
well
to
be
on
our
guard
,
"
observed
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
Next
time
they
may
approach
by
land
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
be
glad
when
our
carriage
arrives
,
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
no
accident
has
occurred
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
need
not
be
uneasy
,
"
said
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
John
and
Lady
Webb
would
probably
pass
the
night
at
Morpeth
,
and
in
that
case
they
could
not
be
here
till
late
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
a
noise
was
heard
at
the
entrance
to
the
roof
of
the
keep
,
and
Lord
Widdrington
made
his
appearance
,
accompanied
by
Mr.
Forster
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
Everybody
seemed
surprised
to
see
his
lordship
,
and
no
one
more
so
than
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
so
soon
returned
from
Berwick
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
his
highness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
succeeded
in
your
errand?""Perfectly
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
hired
a
sloop
now
in
Berwick
harbour
,
which
was
to
sail
this
evening
for
London
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
induced
Captain
Hawker
of
the
Saint
Abbs
,
as
the
sloop
is
called
,
to
alter
his
plan
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
he
has
engaged
to
take
your
majesty
to
Dunkerque
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
rendered
me
a
great
service
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
where
am
I
to
go
on
board
the
sloop?—at
Berwick?""No
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Since
there
is
almost
a
certainty
of
fine
weather
,
Captain
Hawker
will
weigh
anchor
at
nine
o'clock
,
and
fire
a
gun
to
let
you
know
when
he
gets
off
the
castle
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
prince
signified
his
approval
of
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"A
boat
shall
be
ready
to
take
you
to
the
sloop
,
so
that
your
majesty
may
embark
immediately
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
Again
the
prince
expressed
his
satisfaction
,
but
he
asked
Mr.
Forster
if
he
had
noticed
the
boat
containing
the
armed
men
,
that
had
crossed
the
Fairway
,
apparently
to
reconnoitre
the
castle
.
<EOS>
"Those
<EOS>
men
were
only
fishermen
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
I
felt
sure
they
would
move
off
,
and
so
they
did
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
by
those
poor
fellows
that
your
majesty
's
departure
will
be
hindered
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
<EOS>
VIIIHow
the
Sheriff
and
his
Troop
were
cared
forEARLY
in
the
morning
,
Captain
Wogan
with
his
brother
,
and
Mr.
Talbot
and
his
brother
,
set
forth
on
horseback
to
patrol
the
country
,
and
proceeded
towards
Dunstanborough
stationing
themselves
at
various
points
commanding
the
road
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
return
till
late
in
the
afternoon
,
and
then
they
brought
no
alarming
intelligence
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
signs
whatever
of
the
approach
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
had
seen
Sir
John
Webb
's
carriage
in
the
distance
,
but
it
came
on
so
slowly
that
they
had
not
waited
for
it
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
afterwards
the
carriage
arrived
,
and
then
the
prince
learnt
what
had
happened
,
and
was
greatly
amused
by
Sir
John
's
description
of
the
arrest
made
by
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
the
supposed
royal
prisoner
was
taken
to
Newcastle
,
where
the
mistake
was
quickly
discovered
,
and
the
man
set
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
was
likewise
allowed
to
proceed
on
his
journey
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
sheriff
was
very
much
mortified
by
the
great
blunder
he
had
made
,
"
remarked
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
think
he
will
give
up
the
pursuit
,
and
I
fear
your
majesty
may
expect
a
visit
from
him
at
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
I
shall
be
gone
before
he
makes
his
appearance
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To-
night
I
set
sail
for
France
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
such
is
the
case
<EOS>
,
I
have
only
to
wish
your
majesty
a
safe
and
speedy
voyage
,
"
said
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
sincerely
trust
nothing
may
occur
to
interfere
with
your
departure
.
<EOS>
"A
plan
to
be
adopted
in
the
event
of
any
sudden
emergency
having
been
decided
upon
,
the
prince
agreed
to
dine
at
the
mansion
,
and
the
whole
of
the
party
assembled
as
before
,
with
the
addition
of
Sir
John
and
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
All
the
servants
had
received
their
orders
,
so
no
apprehension
was
entertained
of
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
prince
was
not
in
very
good
spirits
,
and
Dorothy
,
who
sat
next
to
him
,
did
her
best
to
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
The
repast
was
about
half
over
,
when
a
servant
hastily
entered
the
room
,
and
informed
his
master
that
the
sheriff
had
arrived
with
a
large
posse
of
men
.
<EOS>
On
this
the
prince
immediately
arose
,
and
in
pursuance
of
the
plan
previously
arranged
passed
through
a
window
into
the
garden
,
where
a
servant
was
waiting
to
conduct
him
by
a
private
entrance
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
No
one
else
attended
his
highness
.
<EOS>
The
company
remained
at
table
;
the
prince
's
chair
being
instantly
removed
,
and
the
vacancy
filled
up
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
the
work
of
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
sheriff
was
ushered
into
the
room
,
and
seemed
greatly
surprised
by
the
sight
of
so
large
a
party
,
for
which
he
was
evidently
unprepared
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
hesitating
what
to
do
,
Mr.
Forster
arose
,
and
greeting
him
in
a
friendly
manner
<EOS>
,
said:"I
hope
you
are
come
to
dine
with
me
,
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
company
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
have
business
of
importance
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"We
will
discuss
that
after
dinner
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"I
am
very
sorry
to
interrupt
you
,
sir
,
but—""Nay
<EOS>
,
I
will
take
no
refusal
,
"
cried
Forster
,
leading
him
to
the
table
.
<EOS>
At
a
sign
from
Forster
a
chair
was
then
brought
,
and
placed
next
his
own
,
and
the
sheriff
was
almost
forced
into
it
.
<EOS>
Jesmond
,
who
had
entered
the
dining
-
room
at
the
same
time
as
his
superior
officer
,
stationed
himself
behind
the
chair
,
wondering
what
would
happen
next
,
but
not
venturing
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
will
you
take
,
Sir
William
—
some
venison
?
<EOS>
There
is
a
fine
haunch
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
""You
ought
to
take
a
prisoner
,
Sir
William
,
"
whispered
Jesmond
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
will
presently
,
"
replied
the
sheriff
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
begin
with
the
venison
.
<EOS>
Is
the
Pretender
here?""I
do
n't
see
him
,
Sir
William
,
"
replied
the
official
,
looking
round
inquisitively
at
the
guests
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
quite
distinguish
the
features
of
the
persons
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
there
is
some
one
rather
like
him
next
to
Sir
John
Webb
.
<EOS>
""Be
<EOS>
quite
sure
you
are
right
,
"
said
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
do
to
make
a
second
mistake
.
<EOS>
"Meantime
<EOS>
,
the
venison
was
brought
,
and
proved
so
good
that
the
sheriff
made
no
objection
to
a
few
more
slices
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
very
readily
accepted
Mr.
Forster
's
challenge
to
a
glass
of
claret
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
in
a
much
better
humour
,
and
partook
of
several
other
dishes
,
and
repeatedly
emptied
the
goblet
which
was
constantly
replenished
by
the
butler
.
<EOS>
The
generous
wine
did
its
duty
,
and
he
almost
forgot
his
errand
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
one
now
to
remind
him
of
it
,
for
Jesmond
had
been
lured
to
the
sideboard
by
the
butler
,
and
a
flask
of
claret
proffered
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
decline
the
attention
.
<EOS>
Since
his
chief
was
enjoying
himself
,
he
did
not
see
why
he
should
not
follow
his
example
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
merely
Mr.
Forster
who
was
attentive
in
the
extreme
to
his
unwelcome
guest
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Widdrington
,
with
both
of
whom
<EOS>
Sir
William
Lorraine
was
well
acquainted
,
though
political
and
religious
differences
kept
them
apart
—
these
two
proud
nobles
,
we
say
,
quite
unbent
,
and
were
excessively
complaisant
,
inviting
him
to
take
wine
,
and
conversing
very
familiarly
with
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Webb
pursued
the
same
course
,
and
as
he
drank
a
glass
of
wine
with
the
sheriff
,
he
gave
him
a
knowing
look
,
just
to
remind
him
of
the
recent
adventure
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
laughed
very
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
dinner
went
on
,
and
the
sheriff
became
yet
more
cheerful
,
as
was
naturally
to
be
expected
,
for
he
had
now
drunk
a
good
deal
of
claret
.
<EOS>
With
the
removal
of
the
cloth
,
the
ladies
disappeared
,
for
they
knew
what
was
likely
to
occur
,
and
then
an
immense
bowl
of
punch
was
placed
before
the
host
for
the
delectation
of
such
as
preferred
that
pleasant
beverage
to
claret
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
for
himself
,
Sir
William
yielded
to
the
seduction
.
<EOS>
At
that
precise
juncture
he
meant
to
have
assumed
an
authoritative
air
,
preparatory
to
carrying
out
the
business
that
brought
him
thither
;
but
a
bumper
of
punch
caused
him
to
postpone
it
to
a
later
moment
.
<EOS>
Jesmond
was
no
longer
there
to
watch
over
him
,
and
incite
him
by
his
observations
.
<EOS>
That
vigilant
official
had
been
taken
to
the
butler
's
pantry
,
where
he
,
too
,
had
his
share
—
somewhat
more
than
his
share
of
a
strong
bowl
of
punch
.
<EOS>
Punch
was
his
weakness
,
as
well
as
that
of
the
sheriff
,
and
he
found
the
temptation
irresistible
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
while
their
leader
was
thus
cared
for
,
the
yeomen
were
neglected
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
they
were
very
well
attended
to
.
<EOS>
They
were
told
that
the
sheriff
had
ordered
them
to
dismount
,
and
they
very
readily
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Their
horses
were
accommodated
in
the
squire
's
roomy
stables
,
and
they
themselves
were
conducted
to
the
spacious
servants
'
hall
,
where
all
that
was
left
—
and
it
was
no
slight
matter
—
of
the
abundant
dinner
was
set
before
them
,
together
with
as
much
strong
ale
as
they
chose
to
drink
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
served
with
punch
,
like
their
betters
,
but
they
were
offered
usquebaugh
,
and
we
may
be
sure
they
did
not
refuse
the
stimulating
liquor
,
which
nearly
resembled
whisky
,
pretty
freely
.

CHAPTER
IXThe
Prince
's
parting
Injunctions
to
Lord
Derwentwater
and
AnnaON
quitting
the
dining
-
room
before
the
scene
of
revelry
commenced
,
the
ladies
left
the
mansion
to
its
noisy
occupants
,
and
repaired
to
the
castle
—
gaining
admittance
in
the
same
manner
as
the
prince
.
<EOS>
They
found
his
highness
in
the
guard
-
room
alone
,
pacing
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
He
questioned
them
eagerly
as
to
how
all
was
going
on
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
scheme
has
completely
succeeded
,
"
said
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
two
hours
'
time
—
if
they
go
on
as
they
are
now
doing
—
the
sheriff
and
his
party
will
be
quite
incapable
of
offering
any
opposition
to
your
majesty
's
departure
.
<EOS>
As
to
their
attacking
the
castle
,
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
""Your
majesty
may
depend
that
my
brother
will
take
good
care
of
your
chief
enemy
,
"
said
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
The
others
will
be
entertained
in
the
servants
'
hall
—
so
well
entertained
that
they
are
not
likely
to
stir
till
your
majesty
is
safe
on
board
the
Saint
Abbs
.
<EOS>
""Excellent
!
"
cried
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
wine
has
never
been
turned
to
better
account
than
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
doubted
the
success
of
the
scheme
,
but
I
did
not
know
the
habits
of
my
Northumbrian
lieges
so
well
as
Mr.
Forster
.
<EOS>
The
sheriff
appears
to
have
fallen
very
easily
into
the
snare
.
<EOS>
""He
was
skilfully
dealt
with
,
"
laughed
Anna—"caught
<EOS>
before
he
knew
what
he
was
about
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
a
little
further
discourse
,
they
came
forth
into
the
court
,
where
they
continued
till
such
time
as
it
began
to
grow
dark
,
when
they
mounted
the
outer
walls
,
and
gazed
at
the
dusky
,
yet
glimmering
expanse
spread
out
before
them
.
<EOS>
The
tide
was
coming
in
,
and
they
could
distinguish
the
white
line
formed
by
the
waves
,
and
hear
their
sound
as
they
broke
upon
the
shore
.
<EOS>
As
had
been
anticipated
,
the
night
was
fine
,
and
the
wind
favourable
for
the
prince
's
voyage
.
<EOS>
Already
,
the
beacon
had
been
lighted
on
Prior
Castell
's
Tower
,
so
that
the
position
of
the
rocky
islands
could
be
discerned
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
could
be
made
out
,
there
were
no
ships
or
smaller
craft
in
the
Fairway
.
<EOS>
The
boat
destined
for
the
prince
was
lying
upon
the
beach
,
but
could
be
easily
pushed
into
the
sea
,
and
two
men
were
standing
near
it
.
<EOS>
Having
made
these
observations
,
the
prince
and
the
ladies
with
him
returned
to
the
basement
court
where
they
found
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
The
tidings
brought
by
the
two
nobles
were
highly
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
No
fear
now
of
any
interruption
from
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
He
was
discussing
a
second
bowl
of
punch
with
Mr.
Forster
,
and
when
that
was
finished
,
a
third
would
be
brought
in
.
<EOS>
His
followers
were
equally
well
employed
.
<EOS>
So
much
boisterous
merriment
was
going
on
in
the
house
,
Lord
Derwentwater
declared
,
that
he
was
right
glad
to
escape
from
it
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
and
since
no
interference
could
be
expected
,
the
prince
determined
to
repair
at
once
to
the
beach
,
and
there
await
the
signal
from
the
ship
.
<EOS>
All
his
slight
preparations
for
the
voyage
being
completed
he
had
only
to
bid
adieu
to
his
fair
companions
;
for
the
two
nobles
,
of
course
,
would
not
quit
him
till
the
last
moment
.
<EOS>
But
the
ladies
were
equally
desirous
to
attend
him
,
and
he
could
not
refuse
their
request
.
<EOS>
So
the
whole
party
quitted
the
castle
by
the
private
entrance
,
and
followed
by
the
gate
-
porter
carrying
the
prince
's
valise
proceeded
towards
the
shore
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
,
as
already
stated
,
but
the
windows
of
the
mansion
were
lighted
up
,
and
the
din
of
merriment
resounded
from
within
.
<EOS>
The
noise
was
welcome
to
the
prince
,
as
it
convinced
him
that
his
enemies
were
occupied
.
<EOS>
Lord
Widdrington
guided
the
party
through
the
heaps
of
sand
collected
at
the
foot
of
the
lofty
rock
on
which
stood
the
fortress
,
until
they
gained
the
beach
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
nearly
high
water
,
and
only
a
strip
of
sand
intervened
between
the
sea
and
the
rock
.
<EOS>
But
the
boat
was
still
lying
where
the
prince
had
descried
it
from
above
,
and
the
men
were
close
beside
it
,
awaiting
orders
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
the
prince
addressed
a
few
parting
words
to
Lord
Derwentwater
and
his
betrothed
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
I
come
back
,
and
I
mean
to
come
back
soon
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
trust
I
shall
find
that
the
contract
which
I
witnessed
has
been
followed
by
a
yet
more
binding
ceremony
,
and
that
two
persons
in
whom
I
take
the
deepest
interest
have
been
for
ever
united
in
the
silken
bonds
of
matrimony
by
our
Holy
Church
.
<EOS>
Do
not
delay
.
<EOS>
When
a
matter
like
this
has
been
settled
,
the
sooner
it
is
carried
out
the
better
.
<EOS>
""There
<EOS>
shall
be
no
delay
on
my
part
—
<EOS>
that
I
promise
your
majesty
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
none
on
yours
,
I
trust
,
fair
lady?""None
,
"
she
replied
,
but
in
accents
so
low
that
they
were
scarce
heard
above
the
sound
of
the
waves
as
they
flowed
within
a
few
yards
of
them
.
"All
<EOS>
then
will
go
well
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
May
our
next
merry
meeting
be
at
Dilston
!
<EOS>
where
the
lovely
bride
,
as
well
as
her
noble
consort
,
will
,
I
am
certain
,
give
me
a
hearty
welcome
.
<EOS>
""That
<EOS>
I
will
,
my
gracious
liege
,
most
assuredly
,
if
I
am
there
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
are
not
there
,
I
wo
n't
enter
the
castle
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
find
you
<EOS>
I
shall
—
<EOS>
or
there
is
no
truth
in
man
or
woman
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
my
liege
,
I
only
meant
that
you
may
perchance
return
before
the
marriage
has
been
solemnised
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
I
not
said
that
it
must
not
be
delayed
?
"
rejoined
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
now
lay
my
commands
upon
you
both
to
that
effect
,
and
I
trust
I
shall
not
be
disobeyed
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
care
that
your
majesty
's
injunctions
are
fulfilled
,
"
said
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
that
assurance
I
shall
depart
in
better
humour
with
myself
than
I
should
have
done
otherwise
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
My
voyage
has
not
been
altogether
fruitless
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
not
succeeded
in
my
own
design
I
have
helped
a
dear
friend
to
a
charming
wife
—
and
that
is
something
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
,
a
flash
of
light
was
seen
in
the
Fairway
,
and
next
moment
the
sound
of
a
gun
was
heard
;
the
loud
report
being
echoed
by
the
rocks
behind
the
party
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
X.The
EscapeALL
<EOS>
eyes
were
turned
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
the
sound
had
come
,
and
a
single
masted
vessel
could
be
imperfectly
distinguished
,
about
half
a
mile
off
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
the
sloop
!
"
exclaimed
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
I
am
summoned
,
and
must
go
,
"
cried
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
farewell!"On
hearing
the
signal
,
the
two
men
instantly
pushed
down
the
boat
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
All
was
ready
,
for
the
valise
had
been
previously
placed
inside
it
by
the
porter
,
together
with
a
couple
of
firelocks
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
arranged
that
the
two
nobles
should
accompany
the
prince
to
the
sloop
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
entered
the
boat
with
him
.
<EOS>
As
the
bark
quitted
the
strand
,
the
prince
stood
up
to
wave
an
adieu
to
the
ladies
—
but
they
were
soon
lost
to
sight
.
<EOS>
Rowed
by
two
strong
men
,
the
boat
made
good
way
towards
the
sloop
,
and
it
seemed
would
soon
reach
her
,
when
an
unlooked
for
interruption
occurred
.
<EOS>
A
dark
object
was
seen
lying
directly
in
their
course
,
and
as
there
could
be
no
doubt
it
was
a
boat
,
much
larger
than
their
own
,
they
turned
aside
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
As
they
did
so
,
the
larger
boat
was
put
in
motion
,
with
the
evident
design
of
giving
chase
,
while
a
loud
authoritative
voice
called
out
to
the
occupants
of
the
smaller
bark
to
stop
.
<EOS>
As
may
be
imagined
,
the
order
was
entirely
disregarded
,
while
Lord
Widdrington
urged
the
oarsmen
to
pull
their
hardest
for
the
ship
,
and
they
made
such
exertion
that
they
appeared
to
gain
upon
their
pursuers
.
<EOS>
Of
the
purpose
of
the
latter
no
doubt
could
now
be
entertained
.
<EOS>
It
was
certain
they
were
endeavouring
to
intercept
the
prince
's
flight
,
and
effect
his
capture
.
<EOS>
How
they
had
obtained
information
could
only
be
surmised
,
but
they
had
laid
their
plans
well
.
<EOS>
The
prince
's
companions
were
greatly
alarmed
,
but
he
himself
maintained
perfect
composure
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
the
boat
I
beheld
this
morning
from
the
castle
walls
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
felt
sure
it
meant
mischief
,
though
Mr.
Forster
thought
otherwise
.
<EOS>
The
men
within
it
are
armed
.
<EOS>
""Luckily
,
we
have
arms
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
,
giving
Lord
Widdrington
one
of
the
muskets
and
keeping
the
other
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
use
them?""Certainly
,
"
replied
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
surrender
to
those
men
.
<EOS>
"A
conflict
,
indeed
,
appeared
inevitable
,
if
they
were
overtaken
,
for
a
voice
called
out
from
the
larger
boat:"Stop
!
<EOS>
or
we
will
fire
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
no
notice
was
taken
of
the
threat
,
except
that
the
rowers
redoubled
their
efforts
,
a
shot
was
fired
,
and
a
bullet
whistled
past
the
prince
's
head
,
but
without
doing
any
injury
.
<EOS>
Exasperated
by
the
audacious
act
the
two
nobles
discharged
their
muskets
,
and
with
good
effect
,
as
was
shown
by
the
outcries
that
followed
.
<EOS>
Evidently
a
couple
of
men
were
wounded
,
and
great
confusion
was
caused
among
the
rest
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
they
lost
way
,
and
the
distance
between
the
boats
was
perceptibly
increased
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
soon
recovered
,
and
continued
the
chase
with
fresh
ardour
,
again
shouting
to
the
fugitives
to
stop
.
<EOS>
"Stand
<EOS>
off
,
villains
,
or
<EOS>
we
will
fire
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
molesting
us
thus?""We
<EOS>
want
the
Pretender
,
and
will
have
him
,
"
rejoined
the
voice
that
had
first
spoken
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
best
deliver
him
up
quietly
.
<EOS>
He
shall
not
escape
.
<EOS>
"Though
<EOS>
very
well
inclined
to
answer
this
insolent
speech
by
a
shot
,
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
forbore
,
but
the
pursuers
again
fired
,
and
this
time
one
of
the
rowers
was
hit
in
the
arm
,
so
that
he
could
not
pull
at
the
oars
,
whereupon
Lord
Widdrington
took
his
place
.
<EOS>
But
the
change
,
though
quickly
effected
,
caused
some
little
delay
,
and
the
pursuers
gained
upon
them
.
<EOS>
An
encounter
now
seemed
imminent
,
and
since
the
prince
was
determined
not
to
yield
,
it
might
be
fraught
with
most
serious
consequences
.
<EOS>
To
avert
these
if
possible
,
Lord
Derwentwater
shouted
lustily
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
captain
of
the
sloop
which
was
now
not
more
than
a
furlong
off
.
<EOS>
Captain
Hawker
was
already
on
the
alert
,
and
prepared
to
render
assistance
.
<EOS>
The
firing
had
shown
him
the
relative
position
of
the
boats
,
and
comprehending
exactly
how
matters
stood
,
he
thought
it
high
time
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
Putting
a
speaking
-
trumpet
,
therefore
,
to
his
mouth
,
he
roared
out:"Sheer
off
,
or
I
'll
sink
you!"The
<EOS>
warning
reached
the
ears
for
which
it
was
intended
,
but
produced
no
effect
.
<EOS>
The
men
went
on
,
as
boldly
as
ever
,
determined
not
to
be
baulked
of
their
prey
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
were
speedily
checked
,
for
Captain
Hawker
turned
a
swivel
-
gun
upon
them
,
and
sent
a
shot
through
the
bottom
of
their
boat
,
which
began
presently
to
fill
,
and
compelled
them
to
look
to
their
own
safety
.
<EOS>
Being
now
disembarrassed

the
prince

safely
on

the

after
taking
an
affectionate
leave
of
his

<EOS>
Their
duty
being
now
performed
,
the
two
nobles
returned
to
Bamborough
Castle
without
concerning
themselves
further
about
their
pursuers
,
whose
vociferations
proved
they
were
still
afloat

able
no

The

safe

Free

peril

the
sloop
,
with
its
important
burden
,
passed
tranquilly
through
the
Fairway

entered

THE
INSURRECTION
IN
SCOTLANDCHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
Hunting
in
BraemarNOT
till
the
accession
of
George
<EOS>
the
First
did
the
general
insurrection
take
place
,
for
which
the
partisans
of
the
Pretender
had
been
preparing
so
long
.
<EOS>
During
the
latter
years
of
Anne
,
who
was
so
much
and
so
deservedly
beloved
by
the
people
,
the
Jacobites
had
remained
quiescent
,
believing
that
in
the
political
crisis
certain
to
arise
on
the
queen
's
death
,
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
would
be
called
to
the
throne
.
<EOS>
Disappointed
in
this
expectation
,
they
determined
not
to
tolerate
a
rule
adverse
to
the
religion
of
the
majority
,
and
hateful
to
all
.
<EOS>
In
the
year
1715
,
at
which
date
we
shall
resume
our
story
,
a
formidable
plot
spread
throughout
England
and
Scotland
,
causing
the
greatest
alarm
to
the
Government
by
the
avowed
intention
of
the
conspirators
to
depose
the
reigning
monarch
,
whom
they
described
as
a
tyrannous
usurper
,
and
restore
the
ancient
sovereignty
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
the
designs
of
his
enemies
,
King
George
made
an
appeal
to
the
Nation
,
in
which
he
said
,
that
after
his
solemn
assurances
,
and
the
opportunities
he
had
taken
to
do
everything
that
might
tend
to
benefit
the
Church
of
England
,
it
was
unjust
and
ungrateful
to
doubt
him
,
and
he
refused
to
believe
that
the
people
could
be
so
far
misled
by
false
representations
as
to
desire
to
place
a
Popish
Pretender
on
the
throne
.
<EOS>
In
an
address
to
his
majesty
by
the
Lord
Mayor
,
James
the
Third
was
denounced
as
an
impostor
,
who
proposed
to
govern
the
kingdom
by
Popish
maxims
,
while
the
High
Church
Tories
,
who
were
regarded
as
the
Pretender
's
main
supporters
in
England
,
and
more
dangerous
than
the
Roman
Catholics
themselves
,
were
stigmatised
as
"
Non
-
resisting
rebels
,
passive
-
obedience
rioters
,
abjuring
Jacobites
,
and
Frenchified
Englishmen
;
monsters
,
whom
no
age
or
country
ever
produced
till
now
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
first
movements
of
the
Jacobites
were
checked
by
the
death
of
Louis
the
Fourteenth
,
and
the
appointment
of
the
Duke
of
Orleans
as
Regent
;
thus
precluding
any
hope
of
immediate
assistance
from
France
,
as
had
been
previously
calculated
upon
,
since
the
Regent
,
on
assuming
the
government
,
had
at
once
entered
into
friendly
relations
with
George
the
First
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
unpropitious
circumstance
,
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
who
felt
that
his
position
had
become
critical
,
sent
orders
to
the
Earl
of
Mar
and
some
others
of
his
adherents
that
a
general
rising
should
take
place
without
delay
.
<EOS>
The
prince
's
command
was
promptly
obeyed
by
the
Earl
of
Mar
,
who
embarked
in
disguise
in
a
coal
-
sloop
at
Gravesend
,
accompanied
by
Major
General
Hamilton
and
Colonel
John
Hay
,
brother
of
the
Earl
of
Kinnoul
.
<EOS>
Eventually
the
earl
and
his
companions
reached
Braemar
Castle
in
Aberdeenshire
in
safety
.
<EOS>
The
forests
of
Braemar
were
celebrated
for
red
deer
,
and
under
the
pretext
of
a
grand
hunting
-
match
,
the
earl
invited
all
the
principal
Scottish
nobles
,
and
chiefs
of
clans
,
whom
he
knew
to
be
opposed
to
the
Union
,
and
attached
to
the
Stuarts
.
<EOS>
His
list
of
guests
included
the
Marquis
of
Huntly
,
eldest
son
of
the
Duke
of
Gordon
,
the
Marquis
of
Tullibardine
,
eldest
son
of
the
Duke
of
Athole
;
the
Earls
of
Nithsdale
,
Marischal
,
Traquair
,
Errol
,
Southesk
,
Carnwath
,
Seaforth
,
Linlithgow
,
and
Panmure
,
with
nearly
a
dozen
others
.
<EOS>
Among
the
chiefs
of
clans
were
Glengarry
,
Campbell
of
Glendarule
,
and
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
They
well
knew
why
they
were
invited
,
and
came
attended
by
numerous
followers
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
grand
sight
to
see
all
these
nobles
and
chiefs
in
full
Highland
costume
,
and
attended
by
their
vassals
and
retainers
,
likewise
in
Highland
dress
,
and
all
carrying
guns
upon
the
shoulder
,
assembled
in
front
of
the
castle
,
preparatory
to
setting
out
on
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
With
them
were
several
couples
of
large
deer
-
hounds
held
in
leash
by
the
huntsmen
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
better
pleased
with
the
sight
than
the
Earl
of
<EOS>
Mar.
Such
a
goodly
attendance
augured
well
for
the
cause
.
<EOS>
Full
of
glee
,
and
expecting
famous
sport
,
the
hunting
party
set
out
for
a
defile
in
the
forest
into
which
they
knew
the
deer
would
be
driven
.
<EOS>
Here
the
terrified
animals
were
found
,
and
great
slaughter
was
made
among
them
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
day
was
devoted
to
feasting
and
carousing
.
<EOS>
Much
venison
was
eaten
—
much
wine
drunk
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
vassals
neglected
—
but
fared
as
well
as
their
lords
.
<EOS>
As
they
could
not
,
however
,
be
accommodated
in
the
castle
,
they
found
a
couch
amid
the
heather
.
<EOS>
Early
next
day
,
the
party
again
set
out
for
the
defile
,
and
a
repetition
of
the
previous
scene
of
slaughter
took
place
.
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
the
hunt
was
over
,
the
nobles
and
chiefs
attended
by
their
vassals
repaired
to
a
rendezvous
agreed
upon
in
the
forest
,
where
they
found
the
Earl
of
Mar
with
General
Hamilton
and
Colonel
Hay
.
<EOS>
When
the
entire
party
had
assembled
,
the
earl
mounted
upon
a
fragment
of
rock
,
jutting
from
the
turf
,
and
addressed
them
.
<EOS>
He
told
them
that
the
honour
and
independence
of
Scotland
were
at
stake
,
and
that
all
true
Scotsmen
who
prized
their
liberty
,
must
fly
to
arms
to
deliver
their
beloved
country
from
the
oppression
under
which
it
groaned
,
and
restore
their
deeply
-
wronged
sovereign
to
the
throne
,
now
occupied
by
the
tyrannous
Hanoverian
Usurper
.
<EOS>
The
Union
—
that
bane
of
Scotland
—
must
be
abolished
.
<EOS>
Bitterly
did
he
regret
that
he
had
ever
countenanced
the
hateful
measure
,
but
he
would
make
amends
by
helping
to
effect
its
dissolution
.
<EOS>
But
they
must
not
stop
there
.
<EOS>
Scotland
had
many
other
grievances
,
all
of
which
would
be
redressed
when
their
rightful
king
was
restored
—
and
restored
he
should
be
soon
.
<EOS>
On
this
,
an
extraordinary
scene
ensued
.
<EOS>
All
the
nobles
and
chiefs
clustered
around
the
speaker
,
drew
their
claymores
,
and
their
example
being
instantly
followed
by
the
vassals
,
more
than
two
hundred
broad
-
swords
flashed
in
the
sun
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
shouts
were
heard
of
"
No
Union
!
"
<EOS>
"
Down
with
the
Hanoverian
Usurper
.
"
"
Long
live
King
James
the
Eighth!"Pausing
till
the
shouting
was
over
,
the
Earl
of
Mar
then
went
on
.
<EOS>
"Thousands
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
England
,
as
well
as
in
Scotland
,
are
leagued
together
to
accomplish
the
end
we
have
in
view
,
and
only
wait
the
signal
to
rise
,
which
will
now
be
given
them
.
<EOS>
Material
assistance
may
be
expected
from
France
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Ormond
and
Lord
Bolingbroke
have
gone
to
Paris
to
induce
the
Regent
to
supply
us
with
men
and
arms
,
and
they
hope
to
return
with
a
French
fleet
.
<EOS>
Furthermore
,
the
Duke
of
Berwick
has
engaged
to
make
a
descent
upon
our
western
coast
,
with
a
large
force
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Duke
of
Berwick
's
name
would
counterbalance
that
of
Marlborough
,
"
said
the
Marquis
of
Huntly
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
not
count
upon
the
great
Marshal
of
France
till
he
has
landed
.
<EOS>
Neither
must
we
depend
upon
the
fleet
to
be
brought
by
Ormond
and
Bolingbroke
.
<EOS>
These
are
doubtful
.
<EOS>
But
we
can
confidently
rely
upon
our
English
allies
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
the
Northumbrian
Jacobites
yet
risen
?
"
inquired
the
Marquis
of
Tullibardine
.
<EOS>
"They
are
on
the
eve
of
rising
,
"
replied
the
Earl
of
Mar.
<EOS>
"
All
the
disaffected
gentlemen
throughout
the
kingdom
are
ready
for
action
.
<EOS>
""Lord
<EOS>
Derwentwater
,
I
presume
,
will
take
the
command
of
the
Northumbrian
force
?
"
observed
the
Earl
of
Nithsdale
.
<EOS>
"He
is
the
fittest
to
do
so
,
"
replied
the
Earl
of
Mar.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
Forster
of
Bamborough
,
who
is
a
High
Church
Tory
,
will
probably
be
preferred
.
<EOS>
Forster
is
very
popular
with
his
party
,
and
as
the
Tories
are
more
influential
with
the
commonalty
in
England
than
the
Roman
Catholics
,
we
must
have
them
heartily
with
us
.
<EOS>
""Lord
<EOS>
Derwentwater
resembles
a
Cavalier
of
Charles
the
First
's
time
,
"
observed
Lord
Nithsdale
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
him
at
the
head
of
a
division
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
so
should
I
,
"
said
the
Earl
of
Mar.
<EOS>
"
But
it
can
not
be
for
the
reasons
I
have
just
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Neither
he
nor
Lord
Widdrington
must
have
a
command
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Marquis
of
Huntly
then
addressed
the
assemblage
,
and
told
them
that
before
proceeding
further
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
appoint
a
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
of
the
Scottish
Forces
,
by
which
thenceforward
the
war
could
be
conducted
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
doubt
,
"
he
said
,
"
on
whom
your
choice
will
fall
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Earl
of
Mar
,
"
responded
a
hundred
voices
;
"
the
Earl
of
Mar
must
be
our
commander
-
in
-
chief
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
again
the
swords
were
waved
.
<EOS>
"I
am
proud
,
indeed
,
to
be
thus
unanimously
chosen
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
consent
to
hold
the
post
for
the
Duke
of
Berwick
,
to
whom
I
shall
at
once
relinquish
it
.
<EOS>
What
I
lack
in
military
skill
and
experience
will
be
supplied
by
veteran
warriors
,
one
of
whom
I
rejoice
to
see
here
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
he
directed
his
glance
towards
a
lofty
figure
,
standing
at
the
outskirts
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
So
tall
was
this
personage
,
who
like
all
the
others
was
arrayed
in
full
Highland
costume
,
that
he
towered
almost
head
and
shoulders
above
those
in
front
of
him
,
and
of
course
could
easily
be
distinguished
.
"'Tis
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
to
whom
I
specially
alluded
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
had
sufficient
experience
,
for
he
has
served
,
and
with
the
greatest
distinction
,
in
Holland
,
Ireland
,
and
France
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
a
word
to
say
to
him
anon
.
<EOS>
"Then
addressing
the
Marquis
of
Huntly
,
he
said:"I
would
not
deprive
myself
of
the
great
satisfaction
your
lordship
has
just
given
me
,
but
I
must
mention
that
I
had
previously
received
a
commission
from
King
James
,
appointing
me
his
lieutenant
-
general
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
taking
a
letter
from
his
breast
he
placed
it
in
his
lordship
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"This
confirms
our
choice
,
"
said
the
marquis
,
after
reading
the
letter
aloud
,
amid
great
applause
and
reiterated
expressions
of
satisfaction
from
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
first
step
,
"
said
the
earl
,
when
silence
was
restored
,
"
shall
be
to
set
up
the
standard
at
Castletown
,
and
proclaim
King
James
.
<EOS>
The
Fiery
Cross
shall
then
be
sent
round
to
summon
the
clans
to
war
.
<EOS>
My
head
-
quarters
will
be
fixed
at
Dunkeld
.
<EOS>
""Within
<EOS>
a
month
I
will
join
you
there
with
three
thousand
men
,
"
said
the
Earl
of
Seaforth
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
arrival
will
be
impatiently
expected
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Mar.
"
But
by
that
time
I
hope
to
be
in
possession
of
Perth
.
<EOS>
How
many
men
will
your
father
,
the
Duke
of
Athole
,
give
us
,
marquis
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Tullibardine
.
<EOS>
"Very
few
,
in
comparison
with
Lord
Seaforth
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
bring
all
I
can
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
duke
,
I
know
,
is
lukewarm
in
the
cause
,
"
said
Mar.
"
<EOS>
But
since
both
his
sons
are
pledged
,
there
can
be
no
fear
of
him
.
<EOS>
""None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
replied
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
the
Duke
of
Athole
's
younger
son
.
<EOS>
Promises
of
substantial
aid
were
then
given
by
the
Earls
of
Southesk
,
Panmure
,
and
other
nobles
,
and
by
the
chiefs
Glengarry
,
and
Gordon
of
Glendarule
.
<EOS>
Last
of
all
came
Colonel
Mackintosh
,
head
of
the
powerful
Clan
Chattan
.
<EOS>
He
engaged
to
raise
six
or
seven
hundred
well
-
disciplined
Highlanders
,
but
stipulated
that
his
kinsman
,
Brigadier
Mackintosh
of
Borlum
,
should
have
the
command
of
the
regiment
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so
,
colonel
,
since
you
desire
it
,
"
said
Mar.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
a
more
important
command
for
your
brave
kinsman
.
<EOS>
Tell
Brigadier
Mackintosh
that
I
desire
to
speak
to
him
,
"
he
added
to
Colonel
Hay
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
order
,
those
who
were
grouped
around
retired
to
a
little
distance
,
and
a
vacant
space
was
thus
left
for
the
old
Highland
warrior
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIBrigadier
Mackintosh
of
BorlumA
VERY
remarkable
person
was
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
Laird
of
Borlum
,
and
since
he
is
destined
to
play
a
conspicuous
part
in
our
story
,
it
may
be
proper
to
describe
him
.
<EOS>
The
redoubted
Laird
of
Borlum
,
then
,
was
an
old
campaigner
,
having
served
in
Holland
years
ago
,
in
Ireland
under
James
the
Second
,
where
he
gained
laurels
,
but
little
pay
,
and
in
France
,
where
he
had
attained
the
rank
of
brigadier
,
which
he
still
held
.
<EOS>
Devotedly
attached
to
James
the
Second
,
on
the
death
of
that
monarch
,
he
had
transferred
all
his
loyalty
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
The
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
had
no
more
zealous
adherent
than
the
brave
Laird
of
Borlum
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
when
we
first
behold
him
,
standing
beside
the
Earl
of
Mar
,
who
had
quitted
his
elevated
position
on
the
rock
to
talk
to
him
,
could
not
be
far
from
sixty
.
<EOS>
Yet
despite
the
hardships
he
had
undergone
,
he
had
few
traces
of
age
about
him
.
<EOS>
His
step
was
free
,
his
glance
piercing
,
<EOS>
his
muscular
power
prodigious
,
and
he
could
still
run
as
fleetly
,
and
endure
as
much
fatigue
as
the
youngest
of
his
clan
.
<EOS>
His
personal
appearance
was
very
striking
—
features
strongly
marked
and
prominent
,
high
cheek
bones
,
a
very
firmly
set
mouth
,
and
square
chin
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
grey
and
keen
,
and
shaded
by
black
brows
,
though
his
locks
were
blanched
.
<EOS>
His
close
-
shaven
cheeks
were
marked
by
many
a
scar
.
<EOS>
The
brigadier
's
expression
was
cautious
,
perhaps
crafty
,
and
sometimes
so
grim
as
to
inspire
terror
.
<EOS>
But
on
occasions
his
habitual
sternness
disappeared
,
and
gave
way
to
a
winning
bonhomie
.
<EOS>
Though
a
rigorous
disciplinarian
,
he
had
always
been
liked
by
those
who
served
under
him
.
<EOS>
His
enemies
said
that
the
brigadier
did
not
object
to
plunder
,
and
that
his
maxim
was
that
war
should
pay
its
own
expenses
;
but
this
was
a
principle
pretty
generally
recognised
by
the
Highlanders
of
the
period
.
"Why
<EOS>
have
you
kept
aloof
,
brigadier
?
"
asked
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
your
lordship
has
others
of
mair
importance
to
attend
to
than
an
auld
trooper
,
who
has
only
his
sword
to
offer
you
.
<EOS>
""Hout
<EOS>
awa
!
<EOS>
your
sword
is
worth
a
thousand
men
,
brigadier
,
and
that
ye
ken
fu
'
weel
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
man
of
all
others
I
must
have
with
me
,
heart
and
hand
.
<EOS>
""I
am
a
man
of
few
words
as
your
lordship
kens
—
I
am
ready
to
do
your
bidding
.
<EOS>
""Aweel
<EOS>
then
,
your
kinsman
,
Colonel
Mackintosh
,
has
promised
to
raise
a
regiment
of
six
or
seven
hundred
Highland
men
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
so
wad
<EOS>
I
,
if
I
could
only
find
the
callants
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
few
and
far
to
seek
at
Borlum
.
<EOS>
""What
say
you
to
taking
the
command
of
the
Clan
Chattan?""That
belongs
to
our
chief
,
unless—""He
chooses
to
resign
it
to
another
,
and
I
approve
his
choice
.
<EOS>
Will
you
take
it?""Gladly
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
,
his
eyes
sparkling
with
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
this
a
'
<EOS>
your
lordship
has
to
say
to
me
,
at
present?""Ye
are
in
a
confounded
hurry
,
"
cried
the
earl
,
detaining
him
.
"
<EOS>
Hear
me
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
lord
,
I
am
all
attention
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
all
our
forces
have
assembled
,
a
strong
detachment
,
to
consist
of
five
or
six
regiments
,
will
be
sent
south
to
march
with
the
Lowlanders
and
the
Northumbrian
insurgents
to
London
.
<EOS>
You
shall
command
the
detachment
.
<EOS>
If
any
man
can
make
a
rapid
march
,
you
can
,
brigadier
.
<EOS>
Long
before
you
reach
London
,
you
will
have
a
considerable
army
,
for
you
are
certain
to
receive
large
reinforcements
in
every
county
through
which
you
pass?especially
in
Lancashire
and
Cheshire
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
therefore
,
be
able
to
give
battle
to
all
the
forces
the
Hanoverian
usurper
can
bring
against
you
.
<EOS>
Win
that
battle
and
the
crown
is
gained
for
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
brigadier
drew
his
broadsword
and
kissed
the
hilt
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
swear
to
devote
myself
to
this
enterprise
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Turn
back
who
may
,
I
never
will!"Thereupon
,
he
bowed
and
retired
,
looking
greatly
elated
.

CHAPTER
IIIHow
the
Standard
was
set
up
,
and
King
James
proclaimed
at
CastletownSHORTLY
afterwards
the
whole
party
proceeded
to
the
castle
,
where
a
grand
banquet
awaited
them
.
<EOS>
Even
more
wine
was
drunk
on
this
occasion
than
on
the
previous
day
,
and
the
company
vied
with
each
other
in
demonstrations
of
loyalty
.
<EOS>
But
the
crowning
act
,
that
was
to
confound
their
enemies
and
confirm
their
friends
,
took
place
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
The
whole
party
assembled
after
breakfast
,
but
without
hounds
or
huntsmen
.
<EOS>
A
dozen
sturdy
bagpipers
made
the
court
ring
with
their
shrill
strains
,
announcing
that
the
Earl
of
Mar
was
about
to
proceed
to
Castletown
,
which
was
not
more
than
a
mile
off
,
attended
by
all
the
nobles
and
chiefs
,
and
all
their
vassals
and
retainers
,
to
set
up
the
standard
and
proclaim
King
James
.
<EOS>
The
principal
personages
were
on
horseback?the
rest
on
foot
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
the
cavalcade
was
the
Earl
of
Mar
,
and
on
his
right
rode
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
who
carried
the
standard
.
<EOS>
The
standard
,
which
made
a
very
splendid
appearance
,
and
excited
general
admiration
,
was
of
blue
satin
,
embroidered
on
one
side
with
the
arms
of
Scotland
,
in
gold
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
was
a
thistle
,
underneath
which
were
the
words
,
"
No
Union
.
<EOS>
"Pendants
<EOS>
of
white
ribbon
were
attached
to
the
banner
:
<EOS>
one
of
them
bore
the
inscription
,
"
For
our
wronged
king
and
oppressed
country
:
"
the
other
,
"
<EOS>
For
our
lives
and
liberties
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
pipers
marched
on
in
advance
,
playing
vigorously
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
fine
,
but
gusty
,
and
Craigendarroch
seemed
to
frown
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Several
Highlanders
joined
the
party
as
they
marched
on
,
and
some
old
men
,
bare-
legged
women
,
young
girls
,
and
children
,
followed
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
few
inhabitants
in
that
wild
region
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
Castletown
,
the
cavalcade
rode
into
the
market
-
place
,
where
all
the
townsfolk
were
assembled
,
and
the
pipers
,
who
had
marched
in
first
and
taken
up
a
good
position
,
played
with
redoubled
vigour
,
while
the
standard
was
set
up
on
the
market
-
cross
.
<EOS>
A
loud
shout
was
then
raised
by
the
whole
concourse
,
after
which
silence
was
authoritatively
enjoined
,
and
a
trumpet
being
sounded
,
the
Earl
of
Mar
read
the
proclamation
in
a
loud
clear
voice
that
vibrated
through
every
breast
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
the
decease
of
the
late
King
James
the
Seventh
<EOS>
,
the
imperial
crown
of
these
realms
has
lineally
descended
to
his
lawful
heir
and
son
our
sovereign
James
the
Eighth
,
and
we
the
lords
and
others
do
accordingly
declare
him
to
be
the
lawful
king
over
Scotland
,
England
,
and
Ireland
.
<EOS>
We
are
bound
by
unalienable
right
to
his
family
and
person
,
and
it
is
to
be
lamented
that
our
fundamental
constitution
has
been
destroyed
by
factions
.
<EOS>
The
unhappy
Union
of
Scotland
and
England
is
also
to
be
deeply
lamented
—
with
many
other
matters
,
such
as
the
bringing
in
a
foreign
prince
unacquainted
with
British
manners
,
customs
,
and
language
—
the
support
of
his
designs
by
foreign
troops
—
and
the
contempt
with
which
the
military
services
of
British
troops
are
treated
.
<EOS>
We
are
determined
to
resort
to
the
last
extremities
,
in
order
to
remedy
these
grievances
,
and
have
our
laws
,
liberties
,
and
properties
secured
by
the
Parliaments
of
both
kingdoms
.
<EOS>
In
conclusion
,
we
hope
that
undisturbed
by
a
Usurper
's
interests
and
council
from
abroad
,
or
by
a
restless
faction
at
home
,
the
blessing
and
aid
of
Heaven
will
be
extended
to
the
succour
of
the
Royal
Family
of
Stuart
and
their
country
from
sinking
under
oppression
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
foregoing
manifesto
produced
a
very
powerful
effect
,
and
the
whole
assemblage
,
having
listened
to
it
with
profound
attention
,
were
about
to
give
vent
to
their
feelings
,
when
a
circumstance
occurred
that
filled
them
all
with
superstitious
terror
.
<EOS>
By
a
sudden
and
violent
gust
,
the
silken
banner
was
rent
,
and
the
gilded
ball
blown
from
the
point
of
the
spear
,
and
falling
at
the
feet
of
Mar
's
horse
,
caused
the
animal
to
rear
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
consternation
was
occasioned
by
this
inauspicious
occurrence
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
blanched
faces
were
seen
around
,
and
the
shouts
died
away
on
every
lip
.
<EOS>
Men
shook
their
heads
,
and
said
it
was
ominous
of
ill
,
and
even
Mar
himself
was
not
free
from
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"When
King
Charles
the
First
's
standard
was
blown
down
at
Nottingham
,
"
observed
Lord
Charles
Murray
to
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
"
it
was
thought
to
presage
ill
.
<EOS>
What
does
this
signify?"The
brigadier
made
no
answer
,
but
looked
very
grave
.
<EOS>
The
ill
-
omened
incident
cast
a
gloom
over
the
party
,
from
which
they
did
not
recover
as
long
as
they
stayed
together
.
<EOS>
On
quitting
Castletown
,
the
nobles
and
chiefs
took
leave
of
their
host
,
and
departed
each
to
his
respective
home
,
to
get
together
his
men
,
and
make
all
needful
preparations
for
taking
the
field
.
<EOS>
Subsequently
,
King
James
was
proclaimed
at
divers
other
places
,
and
once
again
by
the
Earl
of
Mar
at
Kirkmichael
,
near
Dumfries
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
whole
of
the
Highlands
were
literally
in
a
flame
—
the
Fiery
Cross
having
been
sent
round
in
every
direction
to
summon
the
clans
.
<EOS>
Such
vassals
as
neglected
the
mandate
of
their
chief
conveyed
by
this
terrible
sign
—
a
cross
,
dipped
in
blood
,
and
burning
—
were
liable
to
the
penalty
of
fire
and
sword
.
<EOS>
Rarely
was
the
summons
disobeyed
,
and
never
unpunished
,
until
the
passing
of
the
Clan
Act
by
the
Government
.
<EOS>
Returning
slowly
from
Dumfries
,
at
the
head
of
a
thousand
men
—
more
than
half
of
whom
had
joined
him
on
the
way
—
the
Earl
of
Mar
found
his
camp
pitched
by
Colonel
Hamilton
and
Clephane
of
Carslogie
,
in
a
beautiful
situation
on
the
side
of
the
Tay
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
such
large
reinforcements
were
brought
him
by
the
Earls
of
Strathern
,
Southesk
,
Marischal
,
and
Panmure
,
that
he
found
himself
at
the
head
of
twelve
thousand
fighting
men
.
<EOS>
A
most
important
achievement
performed
at
this
juncture
by
Colonel
Hay
gave
additional
éclat
to
the
insurgents
.
<EOS>
This
gallant
officer
had
often
boasted
that
he
would
capture
Perth
,
and
he
now
made
good
his
word
by
surprising
the
garrison
,
and
enabling
Mar
to
occupy
the
city
.
<EOS>
Thenceforward
Perth
formed
the
head
-
quarters
of
the
Scottish
commander
-
in
-
chief
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
rapid
progress
of
the
rebellion
,
the
Government
of
King
George
now
began
to
take
energetic
measures
for
the
repression
of
the
outbreak
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Argyle
hastened
to
Stirling
,
where
troops
were
quickly
concentrated
,
in
order
to
keep
the
Highlanders
in
check
,
and
prevent
them
from
crossing
the
Forth
.
<EOS>
All
Scottish
noblemen
or
gentlemen
,
actually
in
arms
,
or
suspected
of
favouring
the
Pretender
,
were
summoned
to
appear
forthwith
in
Edinburgh
,
and
find
bail
for
their
future
good
conduct
.
<EOS>
But
very
few
surrendered
themselves
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
were
eager
to
take
the
field
,
and
displeased
that
Mar
did
not
give
battle
to
Argyle
,
before
further
succours
could
reach
him
at
Stirling
.
<EOS>
The
Scottish
commander
-
in
-
chief
hesitated
,
though
Colonel
Hay
and
others
of
his
advisers
remonstrated
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
received
a
letter
from
Mr.
Forster
,
praying
him
to
send
a
couple
of
regiments
to
help
them
to
make
a
rising
in
Northumberland
.
<EOS>
This
request
he
was
quite
willing
to
grant
—
indeed
,
he
did
more
than
was
asked
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
sent
off
the
detachment
,
which
he
had
prepared
to
march
through
England
,
under
the
command
of
Brigadier
Mackintosh
.

THE
RISING
IN
NORTHUMBERLANDCHAPTER
IDilston
<EOS>
revisitedSINCE
our
last
visit
to
Dilston
Castle
,
the
place
had
acquired
a
new
interest
from
the
marriage
of
the
young
Earl
of
Derwentwater
with
the
beautiful
Anna
Webb
.
<EOS>
The
event
occurred
about
three
years
previously
,
and
was
productive
of
unalloyed
happiness
to
the
earl
,
who
made
it
his
entire
study
to
please
his
lovely
wife
.
<EOS>
In
his
eyes
her
charms
had
improved
,
and
as
she
was
scarcely
two-
<EOS>
and
-
twenty
,
she
might
not
yet
have
attained
the
point
of
perfection
.
<EOS>
Mistress
of
this
proud
mansion
and
all
belonging
to
it
,
adored
by
the
husband
who
had
raised
her
to
this
exalted
position
,
the
countess
ought
to
have
been
happy
—
and
to
all
appearance
she
was
so
.
<EOS>
Yet
were
we
to
search
her
breast
,
we
should
find
a
secret
sorrow
there
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
every
effort
to
banish
the
feeling
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
The
consciousness
that
she
had
a
secret
from
her
husband
troubled
her
,
but
she
dared
not
reveal
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
Even
to
Father
Norman
,
she
had
not
entirely
laid
bare
her
heart
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
when
she
was
at
confession
in
the
small
chamber
,
employed
for
her
private
devotions
,
and
which
was
furnished
with
an
altar
and
a
crucifix
,
the
good
priest
thus
addressed
her:"I
grieve
to
find
,
dear
daughter
,
that
you
still
keep
back
from
the
earl
,
your
husband
,
the
secret
that
has
so
long
weighed
upon
your
breast
.
<EOS>
This
ought
not
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
is
entitled
to
your
fullest
confidence
,
and
any
concealment
from
him
even
of
a
trivial
matter
is
sinful
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
,
father
,
"
she
replied
;
"
and
I
ardently
desire
to
relieve
my
breast
of
its
burden
by
disclosing
all
to
him
,
and
am
only
deterred
by
the
fear
of
giving
him
pain
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
you
are
right
,
daughter
,
"
said
the
priest
,
after
some
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
no
good
purpose
can
be
answered
by
this
disclosure
,
and
it
is
possible
it
might
cause
temporary
estrangement
of
the
earl
's
affections
,
I
will
not
urge
you
to
incur
that
hazard
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
be
glad
to
learn
that
you
have
at
last
entirely
dismissed
the
silly
fancy
which
you
have
so
long
allowed
to
occupy
your
breast
.
<EOS>
Give
me
an
assurance
to
that
effect
,
and
I
shall
be
content
.
<EOS>
""I
am
far
easier
than
I
was
,
father
,
"
she
rejoined
,
with
a
sigh
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
entirely
subdued
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
""Persevere
,
daughter
,
and
you
will
succeed
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
Fasting
and
prayer
will
do
much
.
<EOS>
""I
am
willing
to
undergo
any
penance
you
may
enjoin
,
father
,
"
she
replied
;
"
and
,
however
severe
it
may
be
,
I
shall
not
complain
—
<EOS>
provided
I
obtain
relief
.
<EOS>
""With
these
good
resolutions
you
can
not
fail
,
daughter
,
and
you
shall
have
my
best
assistance
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
good
father
's
injunctions
were
strictly
obeyed
by
the
countess
,
and
after
a
time
she
told
him
her
breast
was
tranquillised
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
earl
's
felicity
was
entirely
undisturbed
,
except
by
some
misgivings
as
to
the
future
.
<EOS>
Since
his
marriage
a
remarkable
change
had
taken
place
in
his
sentiments
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
he
had
been
chiefly
engrossed
by
the
thought
of
accomplishing
the
restoration
of
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
and
no
peril
would
have
deterred
him
from
making
the
effort
.
<EOS>
He
now
dreaded
being
engaged
in
a
civil
war
.
<EOS>
He
had
everything
that
could
contribute
to
happiness
—
a
lovely
wife
,
to
whom
he
was
passionately
attached
—
high
rank
,
great
wealth
,
large
possessions
,
a
splendid
mansion
—
all
of
which
would
be
sacrificed
,
if
the
enterprise
should
fail
.
<EOS>
The
game
was
too
hazardous
—
the
stake
too
high
.
<EOS>
Never
,
since
his
marriage
,
had
he
been
separated
from
his
beautiful
countess
,
and
the
thought
of
quitting
her
—
even
for
a
brief
season
—
was
intolerable
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
of
his
fears
,
and
she
laughed
at
them
.
<EOS>
"I
should
not
love
you
half
so
well
as
I
do
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
I
did
not
believe
you
would
fight
for
King
James
—
fight
for
him
to
the
death
.
<EOS>
Should
a
rising
take
place
,
you
must
join
it
—
must
take
a
prominent
part
in
it
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
I
wedded
you
,
dearest
Anna
<EOS>
,
life
has
acquired
such
value
in
my
eyes
,
that
I
am
not
disposed
to
throw
it
away
lightly
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
call
it
throwing
life
away
lightly
to
die
for
your
king?""'Twould
<EOS>
be
worse
than
death
to
lose
you
,
Anna
.
<EOS>
""This
is
mere
weakness
.
<EOS>
Shut
me
from
your
heart
.
<EOS>
The
king
's
claim
is
paramount
.
'
<EOS>
Twould
be
a
crime
to
desert
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
to
preserve
my
love
,
you
will
draw
the
sword
for
King
James
,
when
called
upon
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
she
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
Much
irritated
by
the
scornful
tone
in
which
the
countess
had
spoken
,
the
earl
walked
forth
into
the
wood
,
and
did
not
return
till
he
had
regained
his
calmness
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
countess
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
She
received
him
with
a
smile
,
that
dissipated
any
lingering
feelings
of
anger
,
and
no
further
allusion
was
made
to
the
subject
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
Still
,
her
observations
rankled
in
his
breast
,
and
produced
the
effect
she
had
designed
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
if
he
did
not
support
King
James
,
he
should
not
retain
her
love
,
and
that
would
be
a
death
-
blow
to
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
Whatever
course
he
might
take
seemed
to
lead
to
difficulty
and
danger
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
he
was
not
called
upon
for
an
immediate
decision
.
<EOS>
Another
year
of
wedded
bliss
was
allowed
him
.
<EOS>
Not
till
the
expiration
of
that
term
did
the
storm
begin
to
gather
that
was
destined
to
burst
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIA
Warrant
issued
for
the
Earl
's
ArrestAT
length
,
the
mandate
came
.
<EOS>
A
letter
arrived
from
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
enjoining
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
to
prepare
for
immediate
action
.
<EOS>
"So
soon
as
the
standard
is
set
up
in
Scotland
by
Mar
,
you
must
rise
,
"
ran
the
missive
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
the
earl
had
received
a
despatch
from
France
,
the
countess
flew
to
his
cabinet
,
and
found
him
pacing
to
and
fro
within
it
,
in
a
state
of
great
perturbation
.
<EOS>
"Read
<EOS>
that
,
"
he
said
,
giving
her
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
flushed
as
she
scanned
it
,
and
she
exclaimed
almost
joyfully,"You
will
obey
his
majesty
's
orders
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
no
hesitation
now
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
one
man
in
England
on
whose
zeal
and
fidelity
<EOS>
King
James
ought
to
be
able
to
count
,
it
is
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
with
whom
he
is
connected
by
birth
,
and
whom
he
regards
as
a
brother
.
<EOS>
Would
you
disappoint
all
the
hopes
he
has
formed
of
you
!
<EOS>
Shake
off
this
worse
than
womanish
weakness
if
you
would
not
have
me
despise
you
.
<EOS>
""No
more
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
earl
,
almost
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
enough
.
<EOS>
You
have
hardened
my
breast
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
now
what
ensues
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
I
have
roused
you
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Had
you
been
wanting
in
the
hour
of
action
,
you
would
have
been
deemed
a
traitor
to
your
king
,
and
have
lost
the
respect
of
all
honourable
men
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
Father
Norman
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
I
have
come
at
an
unlucky
moment
,
"
he
said
,
perceiving
from
their
looks
that
some
misunderstanding
had
occurred
between
them
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
would
at
once
retire
,
had
I
not
important
news
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
received
private
information
from
Newcastle
that
a
warrant
has
been
issued
for
your
lordship
's
arrest
on
a
charge
of
high
treason
.
<EOS>
The
officers
will
be
here
tomorrow
,
and
as
they
will
be
accompanied
by
a
party
of
horse
-
militia
,
you
must
either
resist
them
,
or
keep
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Since
you
are
not
fully
prepared
for
a
rising
,
I
would
counsel
the
latter
course
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
advise
resistance
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
—
that
would
precipitate
the
outbreak
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
concert
measures
with
my
friends
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
I
take
up
arms
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
remain
in
the
castle
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
A
most
rigorous
search
will
be
made
,
and
if
you
are
discovered
,
you
will
be
apprehended
,
and
placed
in
confinement
.
<EOS>
""Where
<EOS>
shall
I
find
a
secure
retreat
?
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"You
ought
not
to
be
too
far
off
,
in
case
of
a
sudden
emergency
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
lordship
would
be
perfectly
safe
in
Nathan
the
woodcutter
's
hut
in
the
thicket
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
No
one
will
seek
you
there
—
and
even
if
the
place
should
be
visited
,
you
can
easily
escape
into
the
wood
.
<EOS>
""Nathan
<EOS>
Blacklaw
is
a
trusty
fellow
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
perfectly
depend
upon
him
.
<EOS>
His
hut
will
afford
me
an
excellent
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
When
inquiries
are
made
for
me
,
the
servants
can
say
that
I
am
gone
to
visit
some
Roman
Catholic
friends
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
The
statement
will
be
credited
,
since
the
magistrates
must
have
learnt
that
Lord
Widdrington
is
now
staying
with
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Mr.
Townley
,
of
Townley
,
in
that
county
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
go
and
see
Nathan
Blacklaw
,
and
direct
him
to
prepare
for
me
tomorrow
morning
.
<EOS>
""Take
me
with
you
<EOS>
,
I
entreat
!
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
how
you
will
be
lodged
in
the
hut
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
bear
you
company
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
that
can
not
be
!
"
sighed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Your
presence
would
reconcile
me
to
any
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
infallibly
lead
to
my
discovery
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
must
be
at
the
castle
to
see
how
things
go
on
,
and
communicate
with
me
.
<EOS>
""I
quite
understand
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
my
brother
returns
from
Corbridge
,
acquaint
him
with
my
purpose
,
"
said
the
earl
to
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
is
in
any
danger
of
arrest
.
<EOS>
""I
have
received
no
caution
respecting
Mr.
Charles
Radclyffe
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
your
lordship
to
be
the
only
person
threatened
.
<EOS>
But
I
may
hear
further
at
night
,
as
I
expect
a
second
messenger
.
<EOS>
""Long
<EOS>
before
then
,
Charles
will
have
returned
,
"
said
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
for
the
hut
,
"
he
added
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
melancholy
foreboding
that
when
I
once
quit
the
castle
,
I
shall
never
come
back
to
it
.
<EOS>
""Dismiss
<EOS>
these
thoughts
,
my
dear
lord
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rest
assured
that
better
days
are
in
store
for
you

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIIThe
Woodcutter
's
HutPASSING
through
the
garden
,
the
earl
and
countess
took
a
path
that
led
them
along
the
rocky
edge
of
the
ravine
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
flowed
the
Devil
's
Water
.
<EOS>
At
length
they
reached
the
wood
,
and
entered
a
sombre
alley
,
arched
over
by
boughs
,
and
designated
the
"
Maiden
's
Walk
.
<EOS>
"According
<EOS>
to
a
legend
connected
with
the
place
,
a
phantom
,
wearing
the
form
of
a
beautiful
female
,
was
sometimes
seen
in
the
alley
,
and
the
appearance
of
the
"
Maiden
"
was
thought
to
bode
ill
to
any
member
of
the
Radclyffe
family
.
<EOS>
Not
without
some
superstitious
terror
did
the
earl
track
this
darksome
walk
.
<EOS>
He
had
often
been
there
,
but
had
never
beheld
the
phantom
,
but
this
seemed
an
occasion
,
when
,
if
ever
,
the
Maiden
might
be
expected
to
appear
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
alley
,
a
narrow
path
turned
off
on
the
left
,
that
brought
them
,
after
several
windings
,
to
an
open
space
in
the
heart
of
the
thicket
.
<EOS>
Here
stood
the
hut
;
and
thus
buried
,
it
was
not
likely
that
the
little
habitation
would
be
discovered
,
unless
its
situation
were
pointed
out
.
<EOS>
As
the
noble
pair
drew
near
the
hut
,
a
savage
growl
was
heard
,
and
a
large
,
fierce
-
looking
dog
rushed
from
behind
a
great
stack
of
wood
.
<EOS>
The
moment
,
however
,
the
savage
animal
beheld
the
earl
,
he
became
quiet
,
and
crouched
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
the
woodcutter
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
Nathan
Blacklaw
was
strongly
built
,
and
had
a
manly
,
resolute
look
.
<EOS>
On
his
shoulder
he
carried
a
hatchet
,
and
his
costume
consisted
of
a
leather
jacket
,
a
leather
cap
,
and
long
leather
gaiters
,
reaching
considerably
above
the
knee
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
forward
on
hearing
his
dog
bark
,
and
immediately
recognising
the
earl
and
countess
,
doffed
his
cap
,
and
made
a
rough
obeisance
.
<EOS>
"Cheviot
<EOS>
knows
me
as
well
as
you
do
,
Nathan
,
"
observed
the
earl
,
patting
the
dog
's
large
head
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
he
wad
no
ha
'
allowed
any
one
but
your
lordship
and
my
lady
to
come
nigh
the
hut
,
"
said
the
woodcutter
.
<EOS>
"You
must
find
him
a
good
companion
in
this
solitary
spot
,
Nathan
,
"
remarked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Deed
<EOS>
I
do
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
I
dunna
know
what
I
and
my
dame
should
do
without
Cheviot
.
<EOS>
""We
have
come
to
have
a
look
at
the
hut
,
Nathan
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Show
us
inside
it
,
will
you?"Just
then
<EOS>
a
good
-
looking
woman
—
not
more
than
thirty-
five
—
plainly
,
yet
not
unbecomingly
dressed
,
came
forth
.
<EOS>
Without
any
hesitation
or
embarrassment
Dame
Blacklaw
at
once
ushered
the
noble
pair
into
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Necessarily
it
was
very
small
,
but
it
looked
clean
and
tidy
.
<EOS>
It
contained
only
a
couple
of
rooms
:
in
the
largest
,
on
which
the
door
opened
,
the
inmates
had
their
meals
;
it
was
furnished
with
a
chest
of
drawers
,
a
small
oak
table
,
an
arm
-
chair
,
a
rush
-
bottomed
chair
,
and
a
settle
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
there
was
a
clock
,
and
in
one
corner
was
a
cupboard
containing
pewter
plates
,
three
or
four
drinking
-
mugs
,
certain
articles
of
crockery
,
and
a
brace
of
squat
-
looking
Dutch
bottles
.
<EOS>
Fixed
against
the
wall
on
the
side
opposite
the
cupboard
was
a
crucifix
,
for
Nathan
and
his
wife
were
Papists
.
<EOS>
On
the
hearth
burnt
a
cheerful
wood
fire
,
and
above
it
hung
a
large
iron
pot
.
<EOS>
Over
the
mantelpiece
was
placed
a
gun
.
<EOS>
The
inner
room
,
about
half
the
size
of
the
other
,
held
the
bed
of
the
worthy
couple
,
who
had
no
family
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
will
you
say
,
dame
,
when
I
tell
you
that
I
am
coming
to
spend
a
few
days
with
you
?
"
remarked
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
lordship
is
pleased
to
jest
,
"
she
replied
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
very
likely
you
will
stay
here
.
<EOS>
""Likely
or
not
,
you
may
expect
me
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
She
held
up
her
hands
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
speak
plainly
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
find
it
safe
at
the
castle
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
remain
there
I
shall
be
arrested
,
so
I
mean
to
take
refuge
in
your
cottage
.
<EOS>
""I
thought
as
much
,
"
cried
Nathan
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
proud
,
indeed
,
to
afford
your
lordship
a
hiding
-
place
,
and
I
think
you
will
be
quite
safe
here
.
<EOS>
""The

coming
with
a
party
of
horse
-
militia
to
-
morrow
,
and
as
they
wo
n't
find
me
at
the
castle
,
they
are
sure
to
make
a
strict
search
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
'em
try
.
<EOS>
We
'll
baffle
'
em
,
"
said
the
wood
-
cutter
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
however
shall
we
accommodate
his
lordship
?
"
said
Dame
Blacklaw
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
condescend
to
occupy
our
bed
.
<EOS>
""Give
yourself
<EOS>
no
trouble
about
me
,
dame
<EOS>
,
"
interposed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
sleep
very
well
in
that
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
With
Cheviot
to
watch
over
me
,
I
shall
fear
no
nocturnal
intruder
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
lordship
will
have
timely
warning
should
any
one
come
near
the
place
.
<EOS>
Of
that
you
may
rest
assured
,
"
said
the
woodcutter
.
<EOS>
Having
made
all
the
arrangements
he
thought
necessary
,
the
earl
then
left
with
the
countess
.
<EOS>
His
parting
injunction
to
the
woodcutter
and
his
wife
was
to
look
out
for
him
early
in
the
morning
,
and
not
to
breathe
a
word
to
any
one
that
they
expected
him
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVThe
Maiden
's
WalkDESPITE
his
melancholy
forebodings
,
the
earl
little
dreamed
<EOS>
this
would
be
the
last
night
he
should
ever
pass
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
He
attended
mass
in
the
little
chapel
,
and
held
a
long
consultation
with
his
brother
,
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
had
now
returned
from
Corbridge
,
as
to
the
best
steps
to
be
taken
.
"'Tis
<EOS>
unlucky
that
our
friends
are
scattered
at
this
moment
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
we
been
able
to
unite
,
instead
of
flying
from
arrest
,
we
might
have
attacked
Newcastle
,
and
,
if
we
had
succeeded
in
capturing
the
place
,
we
should
have
been
masters
of
the
county
.
<EOS>
""This
may
yet
be
accomplished
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
unless
we
can
get
together
a
sufficient
force
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Forster
and
Lord
Widdrington
may
not
like
to
make
the
attempt
,
as
I
know
they
both
deem
it
very
hazardous
.
<EOS>
We
shall
hear
what
Widdrington
says
on
his
return
from
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
""Shall
I
appoint
a
meeting
if
I
can
find
means
of
communicating
with
them
?
"
asked
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"
And
where
shall
the
place
of
rendezvous
be
fixed?""At
Plainfield
or
thereabouts
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ten
days
hence
I
will
be
there
,
unless
I
am
prevented
,
and
will
bring
with
me
all
the
men
I
can
muster
.
<EOS>
""I
will
find
some
means
of
sending
this
information
to
Forster
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
;
"
and
he
will
communicate
with
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
If
the
Earl
of
Mar
would
send
us
a
Highland
regiment
it
would
help
us
greatly
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
write
to
him
in
your
name?""Do
<EOS>
so
without
delay
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
The
rising
will
never
be
successful
unless
our
force
is
materially
strengthened
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
your
instructions
shall
be
attended
to
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
,
"
and
I
trust
nothing
will
go
wrong
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
affectionate
converse
by
the
earl
and
countess
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
guests
in
the
house
,
so
they
sat
together
till
supper
,
when
they
were
joined
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
The
countess
was
in
excellent
spirits
,
and
laughed
at
the
threatened
visit
of
the
magistrates
.
<EOS>
If
the
earl
was
not
equally
free
from
apprehension
he
contrived
to
assume
a
cheerful
aspect
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
soon
after
daybreak
,
Lord
Derwentwater
arose
.
<EOS>
The
countess
was
still
slumbering
,
but
before
he
took
his
departure
he
stooped
down
to
print
a
kiss
on
her
brow
.
<EOS>
Instantly
awakened
,
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
bade
him
adieu
.
<EOS>
"I
have
had
a
very
happy
dream
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
I
hope
it
may
come
true
.
<EOS>
I
thought
the
king
was
restored
,
and
chiefly
by
your
instrumentality
.
<EOS>
""Much
has
to
be
done
ere
that
can
be
accomplished
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
despair
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
you
could
remain
here
,
and
resist
the
officers
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
How
pleased
I
should
be
to
see
them
driven
hence!""There
is
no
chance
of
such
a
result
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
bide
our
time
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
days
we
shall
take
the
field
.
<EOS>
"Tenderly
embracing
her
,
he
then
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
household
were
astir
as
Lord
Derwentwater
went
forth
.
<EOS>
He
gave
one
look
at
the
mansion
,
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
wood
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
grey
and
misty
,
the
trees
in
the
park
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
,
and
the
brook
at
the
bottom
of
the
glen
was
hidden
by
vapour
.
<EOS>
Gloomy
thoughts
likewise
possessed
him
,
and
as
he
tracked
the
sombre
alley
,
he
thought
he
beheld
a
female
figure
,
arrayed
in
white
,
advancing
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Not
doubting
it
was
the
Maiden
,
he
instantly
stopped
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
the
phantom
stood
before
him
.
<EOS>
Its
looks
were
sad
and
compassionate
,
but
it
spoke
not
,
and
terror
kept
him
dumb
.
<EOS>
After
remaining
thus
transfixed
for
a
few
moments
,
he
broke
the
spell
and
moved
forwards
,
but
the
phantom
waved
him
back
,
and
he
again
halted
.
<EOS>
With
another
warning
gesture
,
accompanied
by
a
look
of
indescribable
pity
,
the
figure
vanished
.
<EOS>
Not
for
some
minutes
after
issuing
from
the
alley
,
did
the
earl
recover
from
the
shock
he
had
received
,
and
he
was
still
leaning
for
support
against
a
tree
,
when
he
was
roused
by
the
approach
of
the
woodcutter
and
his
dog
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
your
lordship
is
unwell
?
"
remarked
Nathan
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
"
but
I
have
been
much
alarmed
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
seen
the
Maiden
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wonder
your
lordship
is
disturbed
,
"
said
the
woodcutter
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
venture
to
ask
what
occurred?""The
spirit
warned
me
to
turn
back
,
"
said
the
earl
,
"
<EOS>
But
it
is
now
too
late
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
woodcutter
made
no
remark
,
but
seemed
to
think
that
the
warning
ought
not
to
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
hut
,
Lord
Derwentwater
threw
himself
into
the
arm
-
chair
and
presently
fell
asleep
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
awake
for
some
hours
.
<EOS>
During
this
interval
,
Dame
Blacklaw
moved
about
as
noiselessly
as
she
could
,
so
as
not
to
disturb
him
—
Cheviot
crouched
at
his
feet
—
and
Nathan
went
on
with
his
work
outside
;
but
he
left
it
,
ever
and
anon
,
for
a
short
space
,
while
he
flew
to
the
skirts
of
the
woods
to
reconnoitre
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VHow
Charles
Radclyffe
provoked
Sir
William
LorraineABOUT
nine
o'clock
on
the
same
morning
,
the
Newcastle
magistrates
arrived
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
They
were
attended
by
certain
subordinate
officers
,
armed
with
sword
and
pistol
,
and
by
a
party
of
horse
-
militia
.
<EOS>
As
the
gate
had
been
thrown
wide
open
by
the
porter
,
they
all
rode
into
the
court
,
and
the
chief
persons
—
three
in
number
—
proceeded
to
the
entrance
and
dismounted
.
<EOS>
Among
them
was
Sir
William
Lorraine
,
who
though
he
had
long
ceased
to
be
high
sheriff
,
was
still
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
As
on
the
former
expedition
,
Sir
William
was
accompanied
by
his
active
agent
,
Jesmond
,
who
was
determined
not
to
be
duped
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
While
the
magistrates
and
the
others
entered
the
court
,
Jesmond
and
his
comrade
Hedgeley
fastened
up
their
horses
and
proceeded
to
the
garden
to
look
about
them
.
<EOS>
As
may
well
be
supposed
,
the
noise
and
clatter
caused
by
this
large
party
of
horsemen
,
had
brought
forth
all
the
servants
,
and
when
the
magistrates
dismounted
at
the
steps
,
they
were
met
by
Newbiggin
and
two
or
three
others
.
<EOS>
In
return
to
their
obeisances
,
Sir
William
,
as
the
principal
magistrate
,
said
in
a
loud
authoritative
tone
to
Newbiggin:"Conduct
us
at
once
to
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
We
hold
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
lordship
is
not
within
,
"
replied
the
butler
,
with
formal
politeness
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
see
him
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
see
how
that
can
be
managed
,
Sir
William
,
seeing
that
his
lordship
is
in
Lancashire
,
"
rejoined
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
Lancashire
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
William
.
"
<EOS>
He
must
have
travelled
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
was
here
yesterday
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
Sir
William
,
<EOS>
but
he
intended
to
ride
throughout
the
night
,
and
I
make
no
doubt
he
is
in
Lancashire
this
morning
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
he
has
fled?""Pardon
me
,
Sir
William
<EOS>
,
he
has
gone
on
a
visit
to
some
of
his
Roman
Catholic
friends
.
<EOS>
""Harkee
,
sirrah
!
"
cried
Mr.
Woodburn
,
another
of
the
magistrates
.
<EOS>
"
Take
care
how
you
attempt
to
deceive
us
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
go
unpunished
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
her
ladyship
,
gentlemen
—
or
Mr.
Charles
Radclyffe
?
"
said
Mr.
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
"It
will
be
necessary
to
see
them
both
,
and
to
search
the
house
as
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Woodburn
.
<EOS>
"You
will
be
good
enough
to
state
your
wishes
to
her
ladyship
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
will
make
no
objection
.
<EOS>
Be
pleased
to
step
this
way
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"He
then
conducted
them
across
the
hall
to
the
dining
-
room
,
where
they
found
Lady
Derwentwater
,
Mr.
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
Father
Norman
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
looked
very
charming
in
her
morning
toilette
,
and
seemed
in
no
way
discomposed
by
the
entrance
of
the
magistrates
.
<EOS>
Still
holding
the
cup
of
chocolate
,
from
which
she
was
sipping
,
she
arose
and
made
them
a
formal
courtesy
.
<EOS>
"These
<EOS>
gentlemen
are
Newcastle
magistrates
,
my
lady
,
"
said
the
butler
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"I
understand
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
explained
that
his
lordship
is
not
at
home?""Yes
,
my
lady
;
but
they
are
not
content
with
my
assurance
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
ladyship
must
be
fully
aware
,
"
said
Sir
William
,
sententiously
,
"
that
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
has
incurred
the
suspicion
of
Government
,
and
will
not
therefore
be
surprised
to
learn
that
we
hold
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
depart
without
him
.
<EOS>
""That
implies
a
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
you
have
just
heard
,
that
his
lordship
is
not
at
home
,
"
observed
the
countess
.
"Where
<EOS>
her
husband
's
safety
is
concerned
,
a
wife
may
perhaps
consider
herself
justified
in
duping
the
authorities
,
"
remarked
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
seem
to
doubt
your
ladyship
's
word
,
you
must
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
will
say
no
more
,
but
leave
you
to
take
your
own
course
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"We
will
put
your
ladyship
to
as
little
inconvenience
as
we
can
,
"
said
Mr.
Woodburn
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
search
the
house
.
<EOS>
""Search
as
much
as
you
please
,
gentlemen
,
you
will
be
disappointed
"
remarked
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
my
head
if
you
find
Lord
Derwentwater
here
.
<EOS>
""I
know
you
to
be
a
man
of
honour
,
sir
,
"
said
Sir
William
,
"
and
therefore
am
inclined
to
believe
you
.
<EOS>
""Inclined
to
believe
me
,
sir
!
"
exclaimed
Charles
Radclyffe
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
'
Sdeath
,
sir
,
you
shall
believe
me
,
or
render
an
immediate
account
of
your
incredulity
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
have
a
quarrel
to
arrange
,
pray
step
out
upon
the
lawn
,
"
remarked
Lady
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
any
other
time
,
I
should
not
refuse
Mr.
Charles
Radclyffe
's
challenge
,
"
said
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
"
But
just
now
I
have
a
duty
to
perform
,
and
shall
not
be
deterred
by
an
idle
threat
.
<EOS>
I
must
again
express
my
conviction
that
Lord
Derwentwater
is
concealed
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
""Then
make
a
careful
search
,
Sir
William
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
can
not
disprove
Mr.
Charles
Radclyffe
's
assertion
,
you
are
bound
to
offer
him
an
apology
.
<EOS>
"Turning
to
Father
Norman
<EOS>
,
she
added
,
"
Your
reverence
will
be
good
enough
to
conduct
these
gentlemen
over
the
house
.
<EOS>
Go
with
them
,
likewise
,
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
take
leave
to
make
one
of
the
party
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
they
quitted
the
dining
-
room
,
leaving
the
countess
alone
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
second
time
that
Sir
William
Lorraine
had
made
a
perquisition
of
the
house
,
and
he
was
able
,
therefore
,
to
get
through
the
business
with
despatch
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
to
brook
a
great
many
insolent
observations
from
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
lost
no
opportunity
of
provoking
him
.
<EOS>
The
search
occupied
more
than
an
hour
,
and
when
it
was
concluded
,
and
the
magistrates
were
obliged
to
confess
their
failure
,
Charles
burst
into
a
contemptuous
laugh
,
and
said:"This
is
on
a
par
with
your
great
feat
at
Bamborough
,
Sir
William
,
which
gained
you
so
much
reputation
in
the
county
,
when
you
were
high
sheriff
.
<EOS>
""You
do
well
to
remind
me
of
the
trick
played
upon
me
at
that
time
,
"
said
Sir
William
,
greatly
exasperated
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
forgotten
it
,
though
Mr.
Forster
and
some
others
may
wish
I
had
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
sir
,
you
will
be
safest
at
Newcastle
,
and
since
I
can
not
secure
Lord
Derwentwater
,
I
will
take
you
with
me
,
and
hold
you
as
a
hostage
for
your
brother
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
imagine
I
will
accompany
you
,
Sir
William
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"You
will
have
no
option
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
taken
as
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""I
scarcely
think
so
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
warrant
,
and
I
will
resist
any
attempt
to
arrest
me
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
angry
colloquy
took
place
in
the
hall
,
and
was
overheard
by
several
of
the
servants
,
who
were
ready
to
rush
to
Charles
Radclyffe
's
assistance
,
should
he
need
them
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
Jesmond
and
Hedgeley
came
in
,
and
the
magistrates
called
out
to
them
.
<EOS>
Profiting
by
this
interval
,
Father
Norman
urged
the
rash
young
man
to
fly
,
and
he
yielded
to
the
counsel
.
<EOS>
Drawing
his
sword
,
he
ran
along
a
passage
communicating
with
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
quickly
followed
both
by
the
magistrates
and
the
officers
,
and
it
seemed
that
a
conflict
would
take
place
on
the
terrace
,
for
the
servants
were
likewise
hurrying
to
the
same
spot
.
<EOS>
The
windows
of
the
dining
-
room
,
in
which
the
countess
was
still
sitting
,
commanded
the
scene
of
action
,
and
hearing
a
noise
she
came
forward
to
see
what
was
taking
place
.
<EOS>
She
beheld
Charles
Radclyffe
standing
there
,
with
his
drawn
sword
,
threatening
any
one
who
approached
him
.
<EOS>
Feeling
,
however
,
that
if
any
catastrophe
occurred
,
the
consequences
would
be
disastrous
,
he
formed
a
different
resolution
,
and
at
once
acted
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Springing
to
the
side
of
the
terrace
,
that
bordered
the
ravine
,
he
flung
his
sword
into
the
hollow
,
and
then
plunged
down
the
rocky
sides
of
the
abyss
,
certain
no
one
would
follow
him
in
this
perilous
descent
.
<EOS>
Those
who
looked
down
from
the
terrace
,
saw
him
reach
the
banks
of
the
Devil
's
Water
in
safety
,
pick
up
his
sword
,
and
then
disappear
among
the
bushes
.
<EOS>
Jesmond
,
who
had
drawn
a
pistol
would
have
fired
at
him
,
but
this
Sir
William
Lorraine
would
not
allow
.
<EOS>
"Capture
<EOS>
him
,
if
you
can
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
must
not
be
wounded
—
unless
he
resists
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
it
did
not
appear
likely
that
anything
more
would
be
seen
of
him
.

CHAPTER
VIHow
Charles
Radclyffe
joined
the
Earl
at
the
HutAFTER
slumbering
tranquilly
for
three
or
four
hours
in
the
arm
-
chair
Lord
Derwentwater
roused
himself
,
and
breakfasted
with
a
very
good
appetite
on
the
simple
fare
provided
for
him
by
Dame
Blacklaw
.
<EOS>
He
next
occupied
himself
in
examining
some
papers
which
he
carried
in
a
small
portfolio
,
and
was
still
thus
employed
when
Cheviot
,
who
had
never
left
him
,
suddenly
raised
his
head
,
and
gave
a
low
growl
.
<EOS>
"He
hears
something
,
"
observed
Dame
Blacklaw
.
<EOS>
But
there
can
be
no
danger
,
or
Nathan
would
have
come
to
warn
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
listening
for
a
moment
,
Cheviot
got
up
and
began
to
whine
,
and
the
door
being
opened
,
he
rushed
forth
,
and
a
joyous
bark
was
instantly
heard
outside
.
<EOS>
Curious
to
learn
who
was
there
,
Lord
Derwentwater
hastily
put
up
his
papers
,
and
went
out
.
<EOS>
To
his
great
surprise
,
he
found
the
new
-
comer
was
his
brother
,
who
told
him
in
a
few
words
what
had
taken
place
,
and
though
the
earl
blamed
him
for
his
imprudence
,
he
felt
greatly
enraged
against
Sir
William
Lorraine
.
<EOS>
"I
should
like
to
drive
these
magistrates
from
the
castle
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"If
you
are
of
that
mind
,
it
may
still
be
done
,
"
rejoined
Charles
.
"
<EOS>
But
for
your
express
orders
to
the
contrary
,
I
would
have
shut
the
gates
,
and
shown
them
fight
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
no
preparations
had
been
made
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
you
are
mistaken
,
"
returned
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
quite
ready
.
<EOS>
All
the
tenants
and
retainers
are
stationed
at
the
farm
;
all
the
horses
have
been
taken
there
;
all
the
arms
and
ammunition
have
been
removed
from
the
old
tower
,
and
deposited
in
one
of
the
barns
;
all
the
grooms
and
active
men
-
servants
are
likewise
at
the
farm
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
have
done
all
this
without
consulting
me
?
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"It
was
done
at
the
urgent
request
of
the
countess
,
"
replied
Charles
.
"
<EOS>
She
said
,
'
It
is
not
fitting
that
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
should
hide
in
hovels
,
when
the
gentry
are
in
arms
for
their
lawful
sovereign
.
<EOS>
It
shall
never
be
said
that
the
officers
came
to
Dilston
to
arrest
him
,
and
were
allowed
to
depart
as
they
came
.
<EOS>
If
no
one
else
will
do
it
,
I
will
drive
them
hence
.
'
<EOS>
I
dissuaded
her
from
this
bold
step
,
but
I
agreed
to
get
all
ready
with
the
design
of
effecting
your
rescue
if
you
should
fall
into
their
hands
.
<EOS>
""You
have
done
well
,
Charles
,
"
cried
the
earl
,
"
and
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
Let
us
to
the
farm
at
once
,
and
if
the
enemy
are
still
at
the
castle
we
will
soon
expel
them
.
<EOS>
""This
resolution
is
worthy
of
you
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
your
flight
might
have
been
misconstrued
.
<EOS>
"Thinking
<EOS>
Nathan
might
be
useful
,
the
earl
bade
him
follow
,
and
hastened
away
with
his
brother
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
VIIHow
<EOS>
the
Magistrates
and
the
Militiamen
were
forced
to
quit
the
CastleTHE
farm
to
which
reference
has
just
been
made
,
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
castle
,
and
was
distant
about
half
a
mile
from
the
woodcutter
's
hut
.
<EOS>
The
earl
and
his
companions
,
however
,
proceeded
so
expeditiously
that
they
were
soon
there
,
but
as
they
were
tracking
a
lane
that
led
to
the
farm
buildings
they
encountered
a
man
,
who
had
evidently
been
reconnoitring
the
place
,
and
instantly
secured
him
.
<EOS>
This
proved
to
be
Jesmond
,
and
though
armed
,
he
did
not
offer
any
resistance
—
probably
thinking
it
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
Disarming
him
,
and
giving
the
weapons
to
Nathan
,
the
earl
told
the
latter
to
shoot
the
man
if
he
attempted
to
fly
.
<EOS>
An
additional
guard
was
found
in
Cheviot
,
who
had
followed
his
master
,
and
cut
off
all
chance
of
the
prisoner
's
escape
.
<EOS>
In
some
respects
this
was
an
important
capture
,
and
the
earl
hoped
to
turn
it
to
account
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
had
ascertained
that
the
party
were
still
at
the
castle
,
and
felt
sure
he
should
take
them
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
farm
-
yard
the
earl
found
between
thirty
and
forty
stalwart
yeomen
collected
there
.
<EOS>
All
of
them
had
got
good
strong
horses
,
and
had
pistols
in
their
holsters
and
swords
by
the
side
.
<EOS>
With
them
were
half
a
dozen
grooms
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
these
sturdy
fellows
sent
a
thrill
through
the
earl
's
breast
,
and
he
reproached
himself
with
not
having
confided
to
them
the
defence
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
set
up
a
shout
on
his
appearance
,
but
he
checked
them
.
<EOS>
Very
few
minutes
sufficed
to
arrange
matters
.
<EOS>
All
the
yeomen
were
quickly
in
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
Mounted
on
his
favourite
dapple
-
grey
steed
,
which
had
been
brought
to
the
farm-
yard
,
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
troop
,
and
bade
them
follow
him
to
the
castle
—
<EOS>
but
ere
they
arrived
there
<EOS>
they
received
an
important
reinforcement
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
Captain
Wogan
,
and
the
rest
of
that
gallant
little
band
,
who
still
held
together
,
were
then
at
Hexham
,
and
having
learnt
that
the
magistrates
of
Newcastle
,
attended
by
a
party
of
horse
-
militia
,
designed
to
arrest
Lord
Derwentwater
,
they
set
off
to
the
earl
's
assistance
,
and
arrived
in
the
very
nick
of
time
.
<EOS>
They
were
galloping
up
the
chestnut
avenue
at
the
very
time
when
the
earl
brought
his
troop
from
the
farm
.
<EOS>
An
immediate
explanation
took
place
;
and
on
hearing
how
matters
stood
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
exclaimed
,
"
I
think
we
can
take
them
prisoners
.
<EOS>
"They
then
rode
quickly
forward
,
and
finding
that
the
whole
of
the
militiamen
were
in
the
court
,
they
drew
up
in
front
of
the
gate
,
so
as
to
prevent
the
departure
of
the
intruders
.
<EOS>
After
this
successful
manoeuvre
,
which
was
very
quickly
executed
,
Lord
Derwentwater
and
the
principal
persons
with
him
advanced
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
Here
all
was
confusion
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
militiamen
had
dismounted
,
and
were
scattered
about
the
court
in
a
very
disorderly
manner
.
<EOS>
While
their
leader
was
shouting
to
them
to
mount
,
Lord
Derwentwater
dashed
up
to
him
,
and
seizing
his
bridle
,
demanded
his
sword
.
<EOS>
The
officer
held
back
for
a
moment
,
but
seeing
that
the
gate
was
strongly
guarded
,
and
retreat
impossible
,
he
yielded
,
and
the
men
did
not
seem
inclined
to
offer
any
further
opposition
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
magistrates
had
been
inside
the
house
,
but
they
now
came
forth
to
see
what
was
going
on
,
and
no
sooner
had
they
done
so
than
the
door
was
shut
and
barred
behind
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
contemplating
the
scene
with
dismay
,
when
Lord
Derwentwater
and
his
friends
came
up
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
tables
are
turned
,
you
perceive
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
earl
,
in
a
mocking
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
here
to
arrest
me
,
and
are
made
prisoners
yourselves
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
your
lordship
wo
n't
detain
us
,
"
rejoined
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
"I
have
no
wish
to
put
you
to
inconvenience
,
but
I
shall
not
let
you
go
,
unless
you
engage
to
return
direct
to
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
a
short
consultation
with
his
brother
magistrates
,
Sir
William
said
,
"
We
agree
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
must
also
deliver
up
the
warrant
,
and
undertake
that
no
further
attempt
shall
be
made
to
arrest
me
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
lordship
must
feel
that
we
can
not
enter
into
such
an
engagement
,
"
replied
Mr.
Woodburn
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
deliver
up
the
warrant
,
but
we
can
not
tell
what
steps
may
be
taken
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
advise
you
not
to
come
again
on
the
like
errand
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
your
officers
has
fallen
into
my
hands
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
him
as
a
hostage
,
and
if
aught
happens
contrary
to
our
present
understanding
,
I
will
most
assuredly
shoot
him
.
<EOS>
Now
,
gentlemen
,
you
are
free
to
depart
as
soon
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"Thereupon
,
the
magistrates
came
down
from
the
perron
,
on
the
summit
of
which
they
had
been
standing
,
and
mounted
their
horses
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
all
the
militiamen
were
in
the
saddle
,
and
ready
for
departure
.
<EOS>
They
muttered
threats
against
the
Jacobites
,
but
were
glad
to
escape
a
conflict
with
them
.
<EOS>
When
Jesmond
found
he
was
to
be
detained
,
he
begged
hard
to
be
set
free
;
but
his
entreaties
were
disregarded
.
<EOS>
The
yeomen
who
had
hitherto
blocked
up
the
gateway
were
now
removed
by
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
departure
of
the
intruders
,
when
a
large
upper
window
of
the
mansion
was
opened
,
and
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
appeared
at
it
.
<EOS>
In
her
hand
she
bore
a
silken
banner
,
embroidered
with
the
badge
of
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
.
<EOS>
Waving
the
banner
above
the
assemblage
,
she
called
out
in
a
loud
clear
voice
,
distinctly
heard
by
all
,
"
Long
live
King
James
the
Third
!
<EOS>
and
down
with
the
Hanoverian
Usurper!"Deafening
shouts
arose
from
the
Jacobites
,
amidst
which
the
magistrates
and
the
militiamen
passed
through
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIIHow
the
Earl
took
leave
of
the
Countess"AT
length
the
decisive
step
is
taken
,
"
cried
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
Now
there
can
be
no
turning
back
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
will
be
safe
to
remain
longer
at
Dilston
,
and
I
would
join
Forster
if
I
knew
where
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
""Two
<EOS>
days
hence
he
will
be
at
Rothbury
,
"
said
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
letter
from
him
by
express
this
very
morning
.
<EOS>
He
is
moving
about
the
country
,
picking
up
all
the
recruits
he
can
.
<EOS>
He
has
now
,
it
seems
,
got
forty
or
fifty
gentlemen
with
him
—
all
High
Church
Tories
,
of
course
—
and
all
well
mounted
and
well
armed
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
good
beginning
,
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
set
out
at
once
for
Rothbury
,
and
take
all
my
own
men
with
me
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
we
shall
largely
increase
our
force
,
as
soon
as
we
take
the
field
.
<EOS>
""That
is
certain
,
"
said
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
get
together
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Since
Forster
will
not
come
here
,
we
must
go
to
him
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
your
resolution
cool
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Let
us
start
at
once!""It
shall
be
so
,
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
The
determination
was
acted
upon
.
<EOS>
The
men
displayed
great
loyalty
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
On
being
informed
by
the
earl
that
he
was
about
to
take
the
field
forthwith
,
they
expressed
the
utmost
willingness
to
follow
him
,
and
fight
for
King
James
.
<EOS>
As
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
was
too
devout
to
start
on
such
an
expedition
as
the
present
,
without
invoking
Divine
aid
and
protection
,
and
as
all
his
tenants
and
retainers
were
of
the
same
religion
as
himself
,
mass
was
performed
by
Father
Norman
in
the
little
chapel
,
at
which
the
whole
party
assisted
.
<EOS>
The
countess
likewise
was
present
,
and
was
deeply
affected
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
touching
sight
to
see
all
those
rude
soldiers
kneeling
there
and
imploring
Heaven
's
blessing
upon
their
arms
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
others
there
,
equally
earnest
in
their
prayers
—
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
his
brave
companions
,
with
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
All
these
were
gathered
in
front
of
the
altar
near
the
earl
,
and
received
the
priestly
benediction
.
<EOS>
When
the
service
was
over
,
all
immediately
left
the
chapel
,
except
the
earl
and
countess
,
who
remained
there
for
a
short
time
longer
.
<EOS>
Their
parting
was
sorrowful
,
for
both
felt
they
might
never
meet
again
.
<EOS>
The
countess
was
more
overcome
than
she
expected
.
<EOS>
During
the
visit
of
the
magistrates
she
had
been
greatly
excited
,
but
a
reaction
had
since
taken
place
,
and
she
was
now
proportionately
depressed
.
<EOS>
Her
beautiful
head
fell
upon
the
earl
's
breast
,
and
she
wept
aloud
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
like
to
leave
you
thus
,
dearest
Anna
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"Heed
me
not
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
rejoined
,
gazing
at
him
with
streaming
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
This
will
soon
be
past
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
defer
your
departure
for
an
hour
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
Come
back
as
soon
as
you
can
—
but
come
not
back
till
you
have
restored
the
king!""Then
<EOS>
I
may
never
return
,
"
said
the
earl
,
gloomily
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
despair
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Be
of
good
heart
,
and
you
will
triumph
.
<EOS>
Night
and
morn
,
I
will
pray
at
this
altar
for
success
to
your
arms
.
<EOS>
And
since
your
cause
is
just
,
Heaven
will
grant
my
prayer
!
<EOS>
And
now
farewell
!
<EOS>
If
you
stay
too
long
here
,
your
resolution
may
waver
.
<EOS>
""No
fear
of
that
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
earl
,
again
straining
her
to
his
breast
.
"
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
farewell!"He
then
tore
himself
away
,
but
when
he
reached
the
door
of
the
chapel
,
he
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
again
kneeling
at
the
altar
,
and
did
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
yeomen
had
been
taken
to
the
butler
's
pantry
,
where
they
lost
no
time
in
discussing
the
plentiful
repast
prepared
for
them
,
and
having
washed
down
the
viands
with
some
jugs
of
strong
ale
,
re
-
mounted
their
horses
.
<EOS>
Refreshments
and
wine
were
likewise
served
in
the
entrance
-
hall
,
of
which
the
Jacobite
gentlemen
partook
.
<EOS>
Before
going
forth
each
drank
the
king
's
health
in
a
large
goblet
of
claret
,
and
each
drew
his
sword
and
devoted
it
to
the
king
's
service
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
the
court
was
empty
,
and
the
various
horsemen
,
who
had
lately
filled
it
,
were
seen
speeding
along
the
chestnut
avenue
,
with
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
at
their
head
,
mounted
on
his
dapple
-
grey
steed
.

CHAPTER
IXMad
Jack
Hall
of
OtterburnHALTING
at
Corbridge
,
the
earl
and
his
companions
drew
their
swords
,
and
proclaimed
James
the
Third
.
<EOS>
Here
half
a
dozen
gentlemen
joined
them
,
and
they
obtained
some
further
recruits
as
they
went
on
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
chief
partisans
of
the
Stuarts
in
the
county
was
Mr.
Hall
,
of
Otterburn
,
in
Redesdale
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
ancient
family
and
considerable
property
,
but
of
eccentric
character
and
ungovernable
temper
,
he
was
known
by
the
name
of
"
Mad
Jack
Hall
of
Otterburn
.
<EOS>
"Under
<EOS>
ordinary
circumstances
it
was
difficult
to
get
on
with
a
person
so
quarrelsome
,
and
he
was
therefore
left
out
of
many
Jacobite
meetings
;
but
it
being
now
necessary
that
every
friend
of
the
cause
should
be
mustered
,
Squire
Hall
was
far
too
important
to
be
omitted
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
had
therefore
resolved
to
visit
Otterburn
,
and
see
what
could
be
done
with
the
crazy
laird
.
<EOS>
He
mentioned
his
design
to
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
the
others
,
who
entirely
approved
of
it
.
<EOS>
About
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
after
riding
for
the
most
part
across
the
country
,
they
entered
a
wild
district
,
erstwhile
the
scene
of
many
a
Border
foray
;
and
after
tracking
it
for
some
miles
reached
the
picturesque
village
of
Otterburn
,
where
the
famous
battle
was
fought
.
<EOS>
Before
them
rose
the
still
proud
pile
that
had
so
stoutly
resisted
the
attack
of
the
Scots
.
<EOS>
Through
the
valley
flowed
the
now
clear
Otter
,
once
been
dyed
red
with
blood
,
while
its
banks
were
covered
with
slain
.
<EOS>
The
approach
of
the
party
had
evidently
been
observed
,
for
as
they
drew
near
the
castle
,
a
tall
man
sallied
forth
from
the
gateway
,
and
greeted
them
with
a
loud
shout
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
and
those
with
him
at
once
recognised
the
Laird
of
Otterburn
,
and
were
glad
to
find
him
at
home
.
<EOS>
In
age
,
Squire
Hall
might
be
forty
-
five
—
perhaps
not
quite
so
much
—
but
his
deep
red
complexion
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
drank
hard
,
and
his
countenance
had
certainly
a
wild
expression
.
<EOS>
But
his
deportment
was
quite
that
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
green
riding
-
dress
laced
with
silver
,
a
black
riding
-
wig
,
and
a
small
three
-
cornered
hat
,
likewise
bound
with
silver
lace
,
and
had
a
sword
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
That
he
understood
what
had
brought
the
party
to
Otterburn
was
clear
,
as
also
,
that
he
was
quite
ready
to
join
them
,
for
he
took
off
his
hat
,
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
a
stentorian
voice
,
"
Long
live
<EOS>
King
James!"The
shout
was
repeated
by
the
new
-
comers
,
and
so
lustily
that
all
the
villagers
rushed
to
their
doors
.
<EOS>
After
cordially
greeting
Lord
Derwentwater
and
those
with
him
,
all
of
whom
were
friends
,
the
squire
led
the
whole
party
into
the
court
-
yard
of
the
castle
,
and
then
told
them
they
must
not
think
of
leaving
him
till
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
imagine
you
will
incommode
me
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
plenty
of
room
in
the
old
castle
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
we
will
drink
the
king
's
health
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
we
will
muster
our
forces
,
and
prepare
to
fight
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
Forster
,
I
hear
,
is
at
Rothbury
,
and
if
I
had
n't
joined
your
lordship
,
I
should
have
joined
him
.
<EOS>
"Very
<EOS>
well
satisfied
with
their
hearty
reception
,
the
earl
and
his
friends
with
the
whole
troop
dismounted
,
and
were
shortly
afterwards
installed
in
various
parts
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
That
beds
were
found
for
all
of
them
—
or
even
half
—
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
in
some
way
or
other
they
were
accommodated
.
<EOS>
Later
on
in
the
day
a
substantial
dinner
was
served
in
the
old
banqueting-
hall
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
wine
was
drunk
that
night
,
as
was
generally
the
case
at
Otterburn
,
and
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
if
a
quarrel
had
not
occurred
between
the
choleric
laird
and
some
of
his
guests
.
<EOS>
For
a
time
,
Squire
Hall
appeared
in
remarkably
good
humour
.
<EOS>
He
proposed
a
great
number
of
Jacobite
toasts
,
all
of
which
were
drunk
with
enthusiasm
,
but
at
length
he
propounded
a
plan
for
taking
Newcastle
by
surprise
,
and
its
absurdity
being
pointed
out
to
him
by
Colonel
Oxburgh
he
flew
into
a
violent
rage
,
and
told
the
colonel
he
was
not
fit
to
command
a
regiment
.
<EOS>
The
colonel
immediately
arose
to
leave
the
table
,
and
Lord
Derwentwater
insisted
that
the
squire
should
at
once
withdraw
the
offensive
observation
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
doing
so
,
the
squire
sprang
from
his
chair
,
drew
his
sword
,
and
dared
Colonel
Oxburgh
to
meet
him
;
but
while
gesticulating
fiercely
he
fell
to
the
ground
,
and
could
not
get
up
again
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
he
was
carried
off
to
bed
,
and
next
morning
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
occurrence
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XThe
Race
on
SimonsideAFTER
a
capital
breakfast
,
the
whole
party
—
now
increased
by
Squire
Hall
and
half
a
dozen
men
—
rode
from
Otterburn
to
Simonside
,
one
of
the
loftiest
and
most
striking
hills
in
Northumberland
.
<EOS>
The
summit
of
this
remarkable
eminence
is
a
complete
plateau
,
and
the
views
commanded
from
it
on
all
sides
are
extraordinarily
fine
,
the
whole
range
of
the
Cheviots
being
visible
on
the
west
,
and
the
German
Ocean
on
the
east
.
<EOS>
As
the
party
were
riding
across
this
wide
plain
,
with
the
intention
of
descending
the
north
side
,
and
proceeding
to
Rothbury
,
Squire
Hall
,
who
had
been
tolerably
quiet
during
the
morning
,
proposed
to
ride
a
race
with
Charles
Radclyffe
for
twenty
guineas
.
<EOS>
"We
will
ride
from
here
to
Rothbury
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
whoever
gets
there
first
,
shall
be
deemed
the
winner
.
<EOS>
"Charles
<EOS>
Radclyffe
instantly
accepted
the
challenge
;
but
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
very
reluctantly
allowed
the
match
to
take
place
,
and
only
consented
from
the
fear
of
causing
a
fresh
quarrel
with
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Without
loss
of
time
,
the
two
gentlemen
were
placed
together
,
and
started
at
once
by
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Both
were
well
mounted
—
both
excellent
horsemen
—
but
Charles
Radclyffe
was
much
the
lighter
weight
,
though
undoubtedly
the
squire
had
the
stronger
horse
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
pretty
sight
,
to
see
them
as
they
scoured
over
the
plain
,
accompanied
by
the
whole
troop
.
<EOS>
The
earl
's
dapple
-
grey
being
fleeter
than
either
of
the
contending
steeds
,
he
could
have
easily
led
them
,
had
he
thought
proper
,
but
he
did
not
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
go
beyond
the
edge
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
On
looking
down
the
steep
slopes
,
he
called
to
the
others
to
stop
,
but
neither
of
them
heeded
him
.
<EOS>
Both
dashed
headlong
down
the
hill
,
and
all
the
lookers
-
on
thought
they
would
come
rolling
to
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
If
ever
Squire
Hall
merited
the
epithet
applied
to
his
name
,
it
was
on
that
day
,
and
Charles
Radclyffe
appeared
little
less
crazy
—
the
general
impression
being
that
both
would
break
their
necks
.
<EOS>
But
somehow
,
the
horses
kept
their
feet
.
<EOS>
The
squire
shouted
lustily
,
as
he
continued
his
mad
descent
,
and
Charles
was
equally
excited
.
<EOS>
To
the
astonishment
of
all
the
beholders
they
got
down
in
safety
,
and
were
soon
afterwards
seen
crossing
the
bridge
;
being
then
so
close
together
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
who
had
won
the
race
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
his
companions
took
an
easier
and
more
secure
route
down
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
the
old
bridge
over
the
Coquet
leading
to
the
charming
little
town
,
they
met
the
two
crazy
riders
coming
to
meet
them
,
and
inquired
who
had
won
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
ca
n't
settle
the
point
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
squire
;
"
it
seems
to
have
been
a
dead
-
heat
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
to
ride
the
race
over
again
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
on
Simonside
Hill
,
"
replied
Lord
Derwentwater
,
laughing
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
where
Mr.
Forster
has
fixed
his
head
-
quarters
?
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
of
him
or
his
troop
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
head
-
quarters
are
now
at
Wanny
Crags
,
"
replied
the
squire
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
gone
there
to
meet
some
friends
.
<EOS>
""Does
<EOS>
he
return
to
Rothbury
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"That
seems
doubtful
,
"
replied
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"
No
one
can
answer
for
his
movements
.
<EOS>
Probably
,
he
will
proceed
to
Warkworth
to
meet
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
we
must
follow
him
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Fain
would
Lord
Derwentwater
have
tarried
for
a
day
at
Rothbury
,
which
offered
many
attractions
to
him
,
but
wishing
to
effect
an
immediate
junction
with
Forster
,
he
only
halted
long
enough
to
allow
his
men
to
refresh
themselves
at
the
comfortable
little
hostel
near
the
church
,
where
they
found
good
ale
.
<EOS>
To
reach
Wanny
Crags
,
they
had
again
to
cross
Simonside
,
and
the
deciding
race
was
run
on
the
summit
,
and
won
by
Squire
Hall
,
who
was
extraordinarily
proud
of
the
achievement
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIWanny
CragsON
descending
the
south
side
of
the
hill
the
earl
and
his
troop
passed
through
a
thick
forest
,
and
then
entered
upon
a
moor
,
in
the
midst
of
which
could
be
seen
a
remarkable
cluster
of
rocks
.
<EOS>
These
were
Wanny
Crags
,
and
on
the
highest
of
them
floated
the
king
's
banner
,
showing
that
the
insurgents
had
taken
up
a
position
there
.
<EOS>
On
a
nearer
approach
to
this
singular
station
,
Forster
and
his
men
could
be
descried
,
grouped
like
bandits
on
the
rocks
;
while
a
great
cleft
served
as
a
stable
for
their
horses
.
<EOS>
As
the
earl
drew
nigh
this
natural
fortress
,
Forster
came
down
from
the
lofty
point
he
had
occupied
and
bade
him
welcome
,
expressing
the
greatest
satisfaction
at
beholding
him
and
his
friends
,
and
adding
,
that
no
doubt
now
they
were
come
,
all
would
go
well
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
do
not
mean
to
pass
the
night
among
these
rocks
,
I
presume
?
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"I
came
hither
in
the
hope
of
gaining
some
recruits
,
"
replied
Forster
,
"
but
have
been
disappointed
.
<EOS>
If
your
lordship
had
not
joined
me
,
I
should
have
returned
to
Rothbury
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
think
it
will
be
best
to
proceed
to
Warkworth
.
<EOS>
The
castle
is
in
our
hands
,
and
Lord
Widdrington
will
be
there
to
-
morrow
with
a
troop
of
horse
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
soon
be
strong
enough
to
besiege
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
can
be
decided
upon
till
our
forces
are
organised
,
and
we
can
ascertain
what
assistance
we
are
likely
to
receive
from
Scotland
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
what
you
say
,
we
shall
be
able
to
hold
a
consultation
with
Lord
Widdrington
to
-
morrow
,
and
can
be
guided
by
his
advice
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
,
a
sentinel
stationed
on
the
highest
crag
,
called
out
that
a
troop
of
horse
-
militia
was
coming
across
the
moor
on
the
road
from
Morpeth
,
and
after
Charles
Radclyffe
had
examined
the
party
through
a
spy
-
glass
he
declared
it
was
Sir
William
Lorraine
,
and
the
party
he
had
brought
with
him
to
Dilston
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
recognise
Sir
William
perfectly
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
do
I
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Squire
Hall
,
taking
the
spy
-
glass
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
quite
certain
he
is
now
on
his
way
to
Otterburn
to
arrest
me
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
to
deal
with
him
.
<EOS>
Let
the
men
conceal
themselves
behind
the
rocks
,
so
that
he
may
not
suspect
the
presence
of
so
large
a
party
.
"Since
<EOS>
no
harm
could
be
done
by
humouring
the
eccentric
squire
,
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Mr.
Forster
complied
with
his
request
,
and
as
he
rode
off
they
concealed
their
men
as
he
had
suggested
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Sir
William
Lorraine
—
for
he
it
undoubtedly
was
—
came
in
sight
of
Wanny
Crags
,
he
was
made
aware
by
the
flag
that
a
party
of
insurgents
must
be
posted
there
.
<EOS>
But
this
discovery
did
not
prevent
him
from
going
on
,
as
he
had
no
idea
the
rebels
were
in
any
force
,
and
did
not
imagine
they
could
muster
more
than
a
dozen
at
the
outside
.
<EOS>
As
Squire
Hall
advanced
,
he
recognised
him
,
and
called
out
to
him
to
stop
,
but
the
injunction
being
disregarded
he
repeated
it
more
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"You
are
my
prisoner
,
sir
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
hold
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
think
you
are
likely
to
execute
the
warrant
,
Sir
William
,
"
rejoined
the
squire
,
laughing
disdainfully
.
<EOS>
"I
would
not
advise
you
to
offer
resistance
,
sir
,
"
said
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
"
And
since
there
is
no
chance
of
escape
you
had
better
surrender
at
discretion,""I
surrender
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
I
defy
you
and
all
your
men
to
arrest
me
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
wheeled
round
,
and
galloped
back
as
fast
as
he
could
to
Wanny
Crags
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
followed
with
the
whole
of
his
troop
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
them
to
fire
,
or
the
career
of
the
fugitive
would
soon
have
been
checked
.
<EOS>
The
squire
called
out
loudly
as
he
drew
near
the
crags
,
and
in
answer
to
the
cry
,
forty
or
fifty
armed
insurgents
suddenly
appeared
at
various
points
;
while
an
equal
number
of
horsemen
,
headed
by
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Mr.
Forster
,
came
from
behind
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
Confounded
by
this
unexpected
sight
,
and
instantly
comprehending
the
snare
into
which
he
had
fallen
,
the
magistrate
would
have
fled
,
but
before
he
could
stir
,
his
bridle
was
seized
by
Squire
Hall
,
who
exclaimed:"You
threatened
to
arrest
me
,
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
Now
you
are
my
prisoner
.
"While
<EOS>
the
magistrate
was
hesitating
,
Lord
Derwentwater
called
out:"Bid
your
men
lay
down
their
arms
instantly
,
Sir
William
,
or
we
shall
fire
upon
them
.
<EOS>
""Hold
!
<EOS>
my
lord
!
"
exclaimed
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
mistaken
if
these
worthy
fellows
are
not
inclined
to
join
us
.
<EOS>
Save
your
lives
,
"
he
added
to
the
militiamen
,
"
and
shout
for
James
the
Third!""Long
live
King
James
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
whole
of
the
troop
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
traitors
!
<EOS>
ah
,
rebels
!
<EOS>
is
it
thus
you
support
your
king
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"Harkee
<EOS>
,
Sir
William
!
"
cried
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
recommend
you
a
little
more
prudence
.
<EOS>
If
you
try
to
take
our
recruits
from
us
we
shall
make
short
work
with
you
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
"
he
added
,
to
the
others
,
"
you
are
now
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
Let
neither
threats
nor
persuasions
lure
you
from
it
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
propose
to
detain
me
,
my
lord
,
if
I
consent
to
deliver
up
my
arms
?
"
said
the
magistrate
to
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"No
,
Sir
William
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
anxious
you
should
take
back
tidings
of
your
own
defeat
to
Morpeth
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
conceal
it
,
since
you
will
not
have
your
militiamen
with
you
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
a
deeply
mortified
look
<EOS>
Sir
William
then
delivered
his
sword
to
Squire
Hall
,
by
whom
it
was
handed
to
Lord
Derwentwater
,
after
which
the
magistrate
rode
off
by
himself
,
and
returned
to
Morpeth
.
<EOS>
A
very
curious
scene
now
took
place
,
as
the
late
enemies
fraternised
,
and
professed
the
greatest
regard
for
each
other
.
<EOS>
All
the
militiamen
seemed
now
to
be
ardent
Jacobites
.
<EOS>
Greatly
rejoiced
at
obtaining
such
an
unexpected
reinforcement
,
the
two
leaders
did
all
in
their
power
to
conciliate
the
new
recruits
,
and
were
by
no
means
sparing
in
promises
.
<EOS>
The
party
did
not
remain
much
longer
at
Wanny
Crags
,
but
proceeded
to
a
hill
called
the
Waterfalls
,
from
the
circumstance
of
a
spring
running
in
two
different
directions
.
<EOS>
Here
they
halted
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
a
large
farm-
house
.
<EOS>
Thence
they
marched
to
Warkworth
,
their
road
lying
for
the
most
part
along
the
banks
of
the
beautiful
river
Coquet
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIIWarkworth
CastleNEXT
day
,
the
two
insurgent
chiefs
,
who
were
lodged
with
all
their
followers
in
Warkworth
Castle
,
were
joined
by
Lord
Widdrington
with
thirty
horsemen
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
would
have
brought
double
that
number
of
men
,
but
horses
and
equipments
for
them
were
wanting
.
<EOS>
Plenty
of
raw
undisciplined
infantry
could
be
found
,
but
cavalry
were
required
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
however
,
the
prospects
of
the
insurgents
were
very
encouraging
.
<EOS>
They
had
plenty
of
friends
at
Alnwick
and
Morpeth
,
and
an
insurrection
would
undoubtedly
have
taken
place
in
Newcastle
,
had
it
not
been
checked
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
Sir
Charles
Hotham
's
regiment
of
foot
from
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
From
accounts
received
from
every
quarter
it
was
certain
that
the
whole
country
was
in
a
most
disturbed
state
,
and
reinforcements
,
though
on
a
somewhat
small
scale
,
were
constantly
arriving
.
<EOS>
The
insurgents
had
not
been
many
hours
in
Warkworth
when
their
numbers
were
augmented
by
a
hundred
horse
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
the
arrival
of
Lord
Widdrington
at
Warkworth
,
the
first
business
of
the
insurgent
leaders
was
to
collect
all
their
forces
in
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
,
and
proclaim
King
James
.
<EOS>
A
large
concourse
likewise
assembled
,
and
great
enthusiasm
prevailed
.
<EOS>
No
locality
could
have
been
better
chosen
for
the
ceremonial
,
which
produced
a
very
striking
effect
,
and
no
ill
omen
attended
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
everything
appeared
auspicious
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
fine
,
and
the
proud
old
castle
looked
its
best
,
and
seemed
to
smile
upon
the
scene
.
<EOS>
After
the
proclamation
had
been
made
—
amid
loud
flourishes
of
trumpets
and
beating
of
drums
,
accompanied
by
the
shouts
of
the
assemblage
—
the
royal
banner
was
placed
on
the
Lion
Tower
.
<EOS>
Later
on
in
the
day
,
a
banquet
was
given
in
the
great
baronial
hall
in
the
keep
,
at
which
all
the
insurgent
officers
assisted
.
<EOS>
The
entertainment
was
intended
to
celebrate
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Forster
as
General
of
the
Northumbrian
forces
,
which
had
taken
place
that
day
at
the
recommendation
of
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Widdrington
,
the
only
persons
who
could
have
opposed
him
.
<EOS>
But
they
both
felt
that
the
commander
of
the
English
army
must
not
be
a
Roman
Catholic
,
and
therefore
withdrew
their
own
claims
,
and
supported
the
High
Tory
squire
,
who
was
generally
very
popular
in
the
county
,
and
to
whom
objections
on
the
score
of
religion
could
not
be
raised
.
<EOS>
However
deficient
Mr.
Forster
might
be
in
military
knowledge
and
skill
,
it
was
thought
he
would
be
saved
from
any
grave
error
by
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
whom
he
proposed
to
have
constantly
near
him
.
<EOS>
The
banquet
passed
off
very
well
,
and
the
best
feeling
towards
the
new
commander
was
manifested
on
all
hands
.
<EOS>
Some
little
disturbance
was
made
by
the
Laird
of
Otterburn
,
but
it
was
quickly
set
right
,
and
General
Forster
put
more
constraint
upon
himself
than
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
in
former
days
at
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
the
castle
began
to
assume
the
appearance
of
a
garrison
.
<EOS>
The
court
-
yard
was
filled
with
recruits
,
who
were
continually
arriving
,
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
Captain
Wogan
were
entirely
occupied
in
examining
them
.
<EOS>
As
much
discipline
as
possible
was
observed
,
but
in
the
present
state
of
things
it
was
very
difficult
to
maintain
it
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
rode
to
Alnwick
,
accompanied
by
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
attended
by
a
strong
guard
,
and
brought
back
with
him
some
necessary
supplies
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
he
was
welcomed
by
the
arrival
of
a
troop
of
Scottish
cavalry
(
known
as
the
Merse
Troop
)
,
under
the
command
of
the
Honourable
James
Hume
,
brother
to
the
Earl
of
Hume
.
<EOS>
This
was
one
of
the
five
troops
composing
the
division
of
South
Country
Scots
now
marching
into
England
,
from
Moffat
in
Annandale
,
and
commanded
by
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
The
Merse
troop
,
it
appeared
,
had
marched
from
Jedburgh
,
over
a
mountainous
and
marshy
country
to
Rothbury
,
where
Captain
Hume
heard
of
Forster
and
Lord
Derwentwater
,
and
finding
they
were
now
posted
at
Warkworth
,
came
on
thither
.
<EOS>
Behind
,
but
following
the
same
route
,
were
the
four
other
troops
,
respectively
commanded
by
the
Honourable
Basil
Hamilton
of
Beldoun
,
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
Captain
James
Dalziel
,
brother
of
the
Earl
of
Carnwath
,
and
Captain
Lockhart
.
<EOS>
The
chief
command
of
the
South
Country
Scots
,
as
we
have
said
,
belonged
to
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
The
Merse
troop
did
not
remain
long
at
Warkworth
,
but
after
conferring
with
General
Forster
,
Captain
Hume
moved
off
with
his
men
to
Felton
,
there
to
await
instructions
from
his
commander
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
agreed
that
an
early
meeting
should
take
place
at
Rothbury
between
the
Northumbrian
insurgents
and
the
battalion
of
the
South
Country
Scots
.
<EOS>
By
noon
next
day
,
so
many
reinforcements
had
arrived
that
General
Forster
found
himself
at
the
head
of
nearly
five
hundred
men
.
<EOS>
Unfavourable
news
,
however
,
from
Newcastle
,
caused
Forster
to
postpone
his
meditated
attack
on
the
town
.
<EOS>
Extraordinary
exertions
had
been
made
by
Sir
William
Lorraine
and
the
other
magistrates
,
who
had
raised
train
-
bands
,
seized
and
imprisoned
all
the
Papists
,
and
shut
the
gates
.
<EOS>
Furthermore
,
it
was
stated
that
seven
hundred
of
the
inhabitants
had
formed
themselves
into
a
company
of
volunteers
,
and
that
the
keelmen
,
most
of
whom
were
Presbyterians
,
and
strongly
opposed
to
the
Stuarts
,
had
offered
an
additional
body
of
seven
hundred
men
.
<EOS>
But
by
far
the
most
alarming
piece
of
intelligence
was
,
that
General
Carpenter
had
been
sent
by
Government
in
pursuit
of
the
rebels
,
with
three
regiments
of
dragoons
and
Sir
Charles
Hotham
's
regiment
of
foot
,
and
was
now
within
a
day
's
march
of
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
After
consultation
with
his
advisers
,
General
Forster
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
give
battle
to
Carpenter
till
he
could
be
certain
of
the
support
of
Lord
Kenmure
and
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
and
he
therefore
determined
to
move
to
Hexham
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
on
the
following
day
,
he
marched
with
his
whole
force
to
Morpeth
,
and
on
the
common
near
the
town
was
joined
by
the
Merse
troop
.
<EOS>
Learning
that
General
Carpenter
had
reached
Newcastle
,
he
continued
his
march
to
Hexham
.
<EOS>
Not
without
great
reluctance
was
the
proposed
attack
on
Newcastle
abandoned
by
the
insurgents
,
for
had
they
gained
that
important
town
,
they
would
have
been
masters
of
the
county
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIIIOrganisation
of
the
ForceLORD
DERWENTWATER
was
close
to
his
own
domains
,
and
a
messenger
having
been
sent
to
Dilston
to
acquaint
the
countess
with
the
arrival
of
the
insurgent
army
at
Hexham
,
she
immediately
rode
over
thither
,
accompanied
by
Dorothy
Forster
,
who
was
staying
with
her
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
Though
rejoiced
to
see
her
husband
,
the
countess
appeared
greatly
disappointed
that
so
little
had
been
achieved
,
and
told
the
earl
she
would
rather
have
heard
from
him
at
Newcastle
,
than
have
seen
him
at
Hexham
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
Dorothy
Forster
show
more
consideration
to
her
brother
,
but
blamed
him
severely
for
quitting
Warkworth
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
could
we
do
there
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
general
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
have
been
cut
off
from
a
junction
with
our
Scottish
allies
and
compelled
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
""Now
<EOS>
you
have
lost
the
whole
of
the
coast
from
Bamborough
to
Newcastle
,
"
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
daring
deed
has
been
done
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
The
fort
on
Holy
Island
has
been
surprised
by
Lancelot
Errington
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
he
will
not
be
able
to
hold
it
.
<EOS>
""You
ought
to
go
to
his
succour
,
"
said
Dorothy
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"You
expect
impossibilities
from
us
,
"
replied
the
general
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
is
impossible
,
"
rejoined
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
content
till
you
have
fought
a
battle
and
gained
a
victory
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
""Women
know
nothing
of
warfare
,
"
said
the
general
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Just
then
an
express
arrived
from
Lord
Kenmure
,
saying
that
he
had
arrived
at
Rothbury
with
the
whole
of
his
force
,
and
desired
to
know
whether
he
should
remain
there
,
or
advance
.
<EOS>
"Bid
<EOS>
him
advance
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"Methinks
<EOS>
I
had
best
resign
my
command
to
you
,
"
observed
the
general
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
beg
you
to
cease
this
interference
.
"
<EOS>
Then
addressing
the
messenger
,
he
said
,
"
Go
back
to
his
lordship
,
and
say
I
will
join
him
to
-
morrow
at
Rothbury
.
<EOS>
""Hold
,
general
<EOS>
,
"
cried
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
you
not
better
give
this
matter
<EOS>
some
consideration?""It
requires
none
,
"
replied
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
message
to
Lord
Kenmure
,
"
he
added
to
the
messenger
,
who
immediately
departed
.
<EOS>
After
some
further
conversation
,
the
countess
and
Dorothy
,
who
had
not
dismounted
,
rode
back
through
the
woods
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Captain
John
Shaftoe
had
set
off
to
Dilston
with
a
dozen
men
,
and
after
searching
the
old
tower
and
some
other
places
,
brought
back
all
the
arms
they
could
find
.
<EOS>
A
very
important
matter
had
now
to
be
settled
,
which
had
already
been
too
long
deferred
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
organisation
of
the
force
,
and
in
carrying
out
this
necessary
measure
Colonel
Oxburgh
was
of
utmost
use
.
<EOS>
After
some
deliberation
it
was
decided
that
the
division
commanded
by
General
Forster
should
consist
of
five
troops
,
of
which
that
of
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
ranked
first
,
and
was
to
be
commanded
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Captain
John
Shaftoe
,
whom
we
have
just
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
second
troop
,
belonging
to
Lord
Widdrington
,
was
to
be
commanded
by
Captain
Thomas
Errington
of
Beaufront
,
who
had
formerly
been
in
the
French
service
,
and
was
brother
of
Lancelot
Errington
,
<EOS>
who
had
just
surprised
Holy
Island
.
<EOS>
The
third
and
fourth
troops
were
respectively
commanded
by
Captain
John
Hunter
and
Captain
Robert
Douglas
,
the
first
of
whom
had
been
a
contraband
trader
of
great
daring
and
skill
,
and
the
other
a
Border
farmer
,
who
had
been
employed
by
Forster
in
searching
for
horses
and
arms
,
and
had
been
extraordinarily
successful
.
<EOS>
Some
objection
was
made
to
these
two
persons
on
the
score
of
position
,
but
it
was
urged
by
Forster
that
they
would
be
of
great
use
.
<EOS>
The
fifth
and
last
troop
was
commanded
by
Captain
Wogan
.
<EOS>
The
first
and
second
troops
were
composed
of
gentlemen
,
who
were
quite
as
well
mounted
and
well
armed
as
their
leaders
.
<EOS>
Many
of
them
had
thoroughbred
horses
—
much
better
adapted
for
speed
than
endurance
—
and
the
rest
were
provided
with
hunters
.
<EOS>
Not
being
able
to
procure
military
saddles
,
they
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
those
in
ordinary
use
;
and
their
equipments
were
by
no
means
complete
.
<EOS>
Still
,
in
spite
of
these
drawbacks
,
they
presented
a
very
gallant
appearance
when
drawn
up
in
the
market
-
place
to
proclaim
King
James
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIVThe
Earl
's
brief
Visit
to
DilstonAFTER
the
business
of
the
day
was
concluded
General
Forster
and
the
officers
sat
down
to
dinner
,
but
Lord
Derwentwater
excused
himself
from
joining
the
party
as
he
wished
to
ride
over
to
Dilston
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
take
a
servant
with
him
,
and
said
he
should
return
by
midnight
.
<EOS>
It
was
growing
dusk
as
he
rode
through
the
woods
that
skirted
his
domains
,
but
it
was
quite
light
enough
to
enable
him
to
distinguish
the
castle
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
sad
as
he
gazed
at
it
,
for
he
felt
he
could
not
remain
there
.
<EOS>
The
place
seemed
his
own
no
longer
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
strove
to
stifle
those
painful
feelings
,
and
they
soon
gave
way
to
other
emotions
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
could
not
banish
the
notion
that
the
place
was
changed
,
though
in
what
respect
he
could
scarcely
tell
,
for
a
groom
came
to
take
his
horse
,
and
Newbiggin
welcomed
him
at
the
entrance
,
and
with
a
manifestation
of
delight
that
could
not
fail
to
touch
his
master
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
your
lordship
is
coming
to
remain
with
us
—
at
least
,
for
a
few
days
?
"
said
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
return
to
Hexham
to
-
night
,
and
to-
morrow
morning
we
march
to
Rothbury
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
butler
looked
quite
cast
down
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
Dilston
will
never
again
be
what
it
was
,
my
lord
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
How
I
wish
your
lordship
could
give
up
this
perilous
expedition
and
return
to
us
.
<EOS>
""That
is
impossible
,
Newbiggin
,
"
said
the
earl
,
scarcely
able
to
repress
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
on
now
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
the
countess?""She
is
here
,
"
cried
a
well
-
known
voice
.
<EOS>
And
next
moment
she
flew
towards
him
,
and
was
clasped
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
questionable
whether
Lord
Derwentwater
's
brief
visit
to
his
mansion
was
not
productive
of
more
pain
to
him
than
pleasure
.
<EOS>
So
many
fresh
anxieties
were
aroused
that
they
marred
his
happiness
,
and
the
moments
flew
by
so
quickly
that
they
seemed
gone
ere
they
could
be
numbered
.
<EOS>
How
much
had
he
to
say
to
the
countess
!
<EOS>
And
yet
how
little
was
said
.
<EOS>
Half
the
time
they
sat
together
they
were
silent
,
but
it
was
a
silence
more
eloquent
than
words
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
countess
spoke
it
was
ever
to
incite
him
to
brave
deeds
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
they
were
joined
by
Dorothy
Forster
and
Father
Norman
,
and
then
the
conversation
turned
chiefly
on
the
incidents
of
the
march
.
<EOS>
The
countess
and
Dorothy
still
believed
that
the
insurrection
would
be
successful
,
but
the
priest
was
less
hopeful
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
where
and
when
will
the
battle
be
fought
that
is
to
give
the
crown
to
King
James
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
think
it
will
be
fought
in
Scotland
,
though
we
shall
probably
march
there
to
meet
our
allies
.
<EOS>
However
,
a
few
days
may
decide
.
<EOS>
General
Carpenter
is
now
at
Newcastle
,
with
four
regiments
of
dragoons
,
and
we
have
yet
to
learn
his
plans
.
<EOS>
Should
he
not
find
out
we
have
flown
,
he
may
march
to
attack
us
at
Hexham
,
and
then
you
will
see
him
here
.
<EOS>
"Never
<EOS>
did
the
devout
Earl
of
Derwentwater
neglect
his
religious
duties
.
<EOS>
Mass
was
therefore
performed
at
the
little
chapel
before
his
departure
,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
he
did
not
reenter
the
mansion
,
but
tenderly
embracing
the
countess
,
bade
farewell
to
her
and
Dorothy
,
and
mounting
his
dapple
-
grey
steed
took
his
way
alone
through
the
wood
to
Hexham
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XVHow
the
Earl
was
rescued
by
Nathan
<EOS>
the
WoodcutterTHE
moon
was
shining
brightly
,
but
her
beams
could
not
penetrate
the
depths
of
the
narrow
forest
road
along
which
he
had
proceeded
for
nearly
a
mile
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
horses
'
feet
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Not
for
a
moment
imagining
it
could
be
an
enemy
,
but
thinking
it
highly
probable
a
messenger
might
have
been
sent
after
him
by
the
countess
,
he
halted
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
your
lordship
there
?
"
cried
a
voice
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
with
me?""You
must
be
pleased
to
come
back
with
us
,
"
rejoined
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
wanted
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""What
has
happened
,
"
cried
the
earl
uneasily
.
<EOS>
No
immediate
answer
being
returned
,
his
suspicions
were
aroused
—
especially
as
he
could
hear
the
two
horsemen
,
who
had
now
come
up
,
talking
together
in
a
low
tone
—
and
he
was
just
about
to
gallop
off
,
when
one
of
the
men
dashed
suddenly
forward
,
seized
his
bridle
,
and
presenting
a
pistol
at
his
head
,
told
him
he
was
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
I
now
know
who
and
what
you
are
,
villains
,
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"We
are
loyal
subjects
of
King
George
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
man
who
held
his
bridle
,
"
and
as
such
are
bound
to
capture
all
those
who
appear
in
arms
against
him
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
very
lucky
tonight
in
arresting
a
rebel
leader
.
<EOS>
Your
lordship
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
we
intend
to
take
you
as
a
prisoner
to
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
earl
suppressed
the
wrathful
exclamation
that
rose
to
his
lips
,
and
said:"Have
any
of
my
household
turned
traitors?""No
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
set
your
mind
at
ease
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
All
your
servants
are
true
to
you
.
<EOS>
We
are
Sir
William
Lorraine
's
officers
,
and
have
been
employed
by
him
to
watch
Dilston
.
<EOS>
We
were
therefore
aware
of
your
visit
this
evening
,
and
followed
you
on
your
return
to
Hexham
,
being
resolved
on
your
arrest
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
your
lordship
is
content
to
go
with
us
quietly
,
"
said
the
other
man
,
"
we
will
show
you
every
attention
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
attempt
to
escape
,
we
will
shoot
you
through
the
head
,
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
And
now
be
pleased
to
deliver
up
your
arms
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
arms
except
my
sword
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
"
and
I
will
part
with
life
rather
than
with
it
.
"While
<EOS>
the
man
,
whose
hands
were
disengaged
,
was
striving
to
take
the
weapon
from
him
,
the
fierce
barking
of
a
dog
was
heard
,
accompanied
by
shouts
,
and
the
earl
at
once
comprehending
from
the
sounds
that
Nathan
the
woodcutter
was
at
hand
with
Cheviot
,
called
out
loudly:"To
the
rescue
,
Nathan
;
to
the
rescue!""Here
<EOS>
I
am
,
my
lord
,
"
responded
the
sturdy
woodcutter
,
as
he
and
his
hound
burst
through
the
trees
.
<EOS>
A
bullet
whistled
past
his
head
,
as
he
appeared
on
the
scene
,
but
luckily
did
him
no
injury
.
<EOS>
Next
moment
,
however
,
the
stout
cudgel
he
grasped
was
falling
heavily
upon
the
earl
's
captors
,
while
Cheviot
's
fierce
barking
terrified
their
horses
so
much
,
that
the
animals
broke
away
in
spite
of
their
riders
'
efforts
to
restrain
them
,
and
being
allowed
no
rest
by
the
hound
who
continued
to
attack
their
heels
,
were
soon
driven
off
altogether
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
not
forget
the
great
service
you
have
just
rendered
me
,
Nathan
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
But
for
you
these
villains
would
have
carried
me
off
as
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""I
am
right
glad
I
arrived
in
time
,
"
replied
the
woodcutter
.
"
<EOS>
Cheviot
warned
me
of
your
lordship
's
danger
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
did
he
so
?
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
faithful
animal
came
back
from
the
chase
,
he
warmly
praised
him
and
caressed
him
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
,
hie
thee
to
the
castle
,
Nathan
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
See
her
ladyship
,
and
tell
her
from
what
a
peril
you
have
rescued
me
.
<EOS>
She
will
know
how
to
recompense
you
.
<EOS>
""I
want
no
recompense
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
honest
woodcutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
I
could
always
be
at
hand
to
succour
your
lordship
when
in
need
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
you
could
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
galloped
off
and
arrived
without
further
molestation
at
Hexham
;
while
Nathan
proceeded
,
as
bidden
,
to
the
castle
,
and
related
the
earl
's
adventure
in
the
forest
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
A
good
supper
for
each
of
them
was
the
immediate
reward
of
himself
and
his
hound

THE
MARCH
FROM
HEXHAM
TO
LONGTOWNCHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
Junction
with
the
South
Country
<EOS>
ScotsNext
morning
,
at
a
very
early
hour
,
the
whole
of
the
insurgent
troops
assembled
in
the
marketplace
of
the
ancient
town
of
Hexham
,
preparatory
to
marching
to
Rothbury
.
<EOS>
Here
Lord
Widdrington
took
leave
of
his
friends
for
a
time
,
having
,
at
General
Forster
's
earnest
request
,
undertaken
another
journey
into
Lancashire
to
confer
with
the
Jacobites
and
High
Church
Tories
in
that
county
,
and
endeavour
to
induce
them
to
rise
without
delay
.
<EOS>
The
chief
command
of
his
troop
was
therefore
temporarily
given
to
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
Precisely
as
the
abbey
church
clock
struck
six
the
insurgents
rode
out
of
Hexham
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
fine
,
and
the
men
in
good
spirits
.
<EOS>
They
met
with
no
misadventure
on
the
road
,
nor
did
they
hear
any
tidings
of
the
enemy
,
but
after
a
long
halt
at
Kirkharle
,
they
reached
Rothbury
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Lord
Kenmure
,
the
commander
of
the
South
Country
Scots
,
accompanied
by
the
Earl
of
Nithsdale
,
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
the
Earl
of
Carnwath
,
and
Lord
Nairn
rode
out
to
meet
them
,
and
the
greatest
satisfaction
was
evinced
on
both
sides
that
a
junction
of
their
forces
had
,
at
length
,
been
effected
.
<EOS>
Still
,
it
was
the
opinion
of
Lord
Kenmure
and
the
other
Scottish
nobles
that
they
must
not
venture
upon
an
encounter
with
the
Government
troops
till
they
were
further
strengthened
by
a
junction
with
Mackintosh
and
the
Highlanders
,
and
they
therefore
proposed
to
set
out
to
Wooler
next
day
.
<EOS>
This
proposition
being
agreed
to
by
General
Forster
and
his
officers
,
the
horses
were
stabled
,
and
the
men
quartered
as
well
as
circumstances
would
admit
,
while
their
leaders
sat
down
to
an
excellent
supper
provided
for
them
by
the
Scottish
nobles
at
the
Blue
Star
.
<EOS>
Capital
claret
,
it
appeared
,
could
be
had
at
Rothbury
,
and
a
good
deal
of
it
was
drunk
that
night
.
<EOS>
Before
they
separated
,
the
English
and
Scottish
commanders
became
boon
companions
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
the
combined
forces
proceeded
to
Wooler
,
and
being
greatly
fatigued
by
their
march
<EOS>
remained
there
during
the
whole
of
the
next
day
,
though
their
quarters
were
far
from
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
At
Wooler
they
were
joined
by
the
Reverend
Robert
Patten
of
Allendale
,
whom
General
Forster
appointed
his
chaplain
,
and
by
Mr.
Lancelot
Errington
,
the
gallant
young
gentleman
who
had
succeeded
in
capturing
a
fort
on
Holy
Island
,
as
already
related
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Errington
,
however
,
not
receiving
any
supplies
,
was
attacked
,
and
taken
prisoner
by
the
Governor
of
Berwick
,
but
speedily
effected
his
escape
,
and
procuring
a
horse
,
joined
his
friends
at
Wooler
.
<EOS>
His
brother
,
Captain
Thomas
Errington
now
commanded
Lord
Widdrington
's
troop
,
so
that
he
was
at
once
appointed
one
of
the
officers
.
<EOS>
Intelligence
was
brought
by
this
gentleman
that
Brigadier
Mackintosh
and
the
Highlanders
had
reached
Dunse
,
and
meant
to
attack
Kelso
,
which
was
occupied
by
Sir
William
Bennet
of
Grubet
,
with
a
strong
party
of
militia
and
some
volunteers
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
,
it
was
said
,
had
barricaded
the
town
,
and
made
other
preparations
for
its
defence
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
Lord
Kenmure
and
General
Forster
decided
upon
marching
to
Kelso
to
aid
Mackintosh
in
storming
the
town
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
set
out
next
morning
,
passing
by
Humbledon
Heugh
,
Akeld
,
and
over
the
hill
ridges
near
Kirk
Newton
.
<EOS>
As
they
proceeded
,
Captain
Douglas
,
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
country
,
and
accustomed
to
Border
forays
,
as
we
have
already
stated
,
managed
to
seize
several
horses
,
and
likewise
captured
Mr.
Selby
of
Kilham
,
a
volunteer
,
who
was
repairing
to
Kelso
,
to
Sir
William
Bennet
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
About
mid
-
day
the
insurgents
came
in
sight
of
the
beautiful
town
of
Kelso
,
with
its
ancient
abbey
so
charmingly
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
Tweed
,
and
before
proceeding
further
,
halted
on
a
moor
to
call
over
the
rolls
of
the
men
.
<EOS>
While
the
leaders
of
each
troop
were
thus
employed
,
word
was
brought
by
a
scout
,
that
Sir
William
Bennet
,
alarmed
by
the
report
of
the
advance
of
the
Highlanders
,
had
abandoned
the
town
,
whereupon
they
at
once
resumed
their
march
,
and
fording
the
Tweed
,
entered
the
town
without
opposition
—
the
barricades
being
already
pulled
down
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
inhabitants
offered
no
resistance
,
they
received
them
with
great
coldness
,
and
eyed
them
with
sullen
looks
.
<EOS>
No
shouts
were
heard
,
as
the
insurgents
rode
along
one
of
the
main
streets
to
the
market
-
place
where
they
drew
up
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
had
not
yet
arrived
,
but
he
was
known
to
be
close
at
hand
,
and
Lord
Kenmure
feeling
that
the
compliment
was
due
to
the
valiant
Highland
commander
,
went
to
meet
him
,
leaving
General
Forster
and
the
English
division
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
Lord
Kenmure
and
the
Lowlanders
had
not
ridden
further
than
Ednam
Bridge
when
the
shrill
notes
of
the
bagpipes
announced
the
approach
of
the
Highlanders
,
and
in
another
minute
Mackintosh
and
his
detachment
came
in
sight
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
Highlanders
understood
that
the
troops
in
front
of
them
were
friends
,
they
set
up
a
great
shout
,
and
quickened
their
pace
.
<EOS>
The
Lowlanders
responded
with
equal
vigour
,
and
the
greatest
enthusiasm
was
displayed
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
cordial
than
the
meeting
between
the
two
commanders
.
<EOS>
Lord
Kenmure
was
loud
in
his
praises
of
the
brigadier
's
skill
and
bravery
,
and
told
him
that
he
looked
upon
the
crossing
of
the
Firth
,
under
the
circumstances
,
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
exploits
ever
performed
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
then
turned
to
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
Lord
Nairn
,
Major
Forbes
,
Logie
Drummond
,
and
others
who
were
standing
by
,
and
expressed
his
admiration
of
their
gallantry
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
the
Earl
of
Carnwath
,
Captain
Hume
,
and
the
other
Lowland
officers
had
come
up
,
and
salutations
were
exchanged
on
all
hands
.
<EOS>
When
these
greetings
were
over
,
the
two
detachments
,
which
had
now
to
a
certain
extent
become
mixed
together
,
marched
to
Kelso
—
the
pipers
taking
the
lead
,
and
playing
lustily
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIMackintosh
's
AchievementsBEFORE
proceeding
,
it
may
be
necessary
briefly
to
explain
what
the
brigadier
had
accomplished
since
he
quitted
Perth
about
ten
days
previously
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
,
the
detachment
under
his
command
consisted
of
six
regiments
,
and
with
a
number
of
gentlemen
volunteers
formed
a
total
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
men
.
<EOS>
The
brigadier
's
orders
from
the
Earl
of
Mar
were
to
get
as
many
men
as
he
could
over
the
Firth
,
and
though
the
channel
was
defended
by
ships
of
war
,
smacks
,
and
boats
filled
with
armed
men
,
Mackintosh
courageously
made
the
attempt
,
and
despite
all
the
exertions
of
the
cruisers
to
prevent
him
,
succeeded
in
reaching
the
East
Lothian
coast
with
fifteen
hundred
men
—
the
Earl
of
Strathmore
's
battalion
being
forced
back
and
compelled
to
go
on
shore
on
the
Isle
of
<EOS>
May.
This
was
the
exploit
to
which
Lord
Kenmure
had
referred
in
terms
of
such
high
admiration
.
<EOS>
With
the
troops
he
had
thus
brought
across
the
Firth
,
the
brigadier
at
once
marched
to
Haddington
,
where
he
was
invited
by
the
Scottish
Jacobites
to
make
an
attempt
on
Edinburgh
,
and
unhesitatingly
complied
with
the
request
.
<EOS>
He
advanced
as
far
as
Jock
's
Lodge
,
but
not
meeting
with
the
promised
support
,
he
turned
to
Leith
,
and
took
possession
of
a
partly
-
demolished
fort
,
built
by
Oliver
Cromwell
,
and
proceeded
to
barricade
it
.
<EOS>
Next
day
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
who
had
hastened
from
Stirling
to
the
protection
of
Edinburgh
,
summoned
him
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
On
his
refusal
,
the
duke
threatened
to
bombard
the
fort
on
the
morrow
,
but
in
the
night
Mackintosh
withdrew
,
and
conducted
his
men
cautiously
along
the
sands
at
low
water
to
Seaton
House
—
a
castle
belonging
to
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
Here
he
posted
himself
securely
with
his
force
,
and
laughed
at
the
threats
of
Lord
Torpichen
and
the
Earl
of
Rothes
,
who
came
from
Edinburgh
to
dislodge
him
with
two
hundred
dragoons
and
three
hundred
volunteers
.
<EOS>
At
Seaton
House
he
remained
for
a
couple
of
days
,
and
in
that
short
interval
stored
it
with
provisions
to
stand
a
siege
,
when
he
learnt
that
the
South
Country
Scots
and
Northumbrians
had
risen
,
and
received
an
express
from
Forster
praying
him
to
meet
him
at
Coldstream
or
Kelso
.
<EOS>
Another
express
came
from
the
Earl
of
Mar
bidding
him
march
south
,
and
join
the
English
insurgents
.
<EOS>
The
latter
order
could
not
be
disobeyed
,
and
he
therefore
quitted
the
stronghold
he
had
gained
,
and
marched
to
Longformacus
,
harassed
in
the
rear
by
the
Government
troops
.
<EOS>
But
this
pursuit
did
not
prevent
him
from
plundering
the
house
of
Doctor
Sinclair
,
who
had
incurred
the
animosity
of
the
Jacobites
by
shooting
young
Hepburn
of
Keith
.
<EOS>
Continuing
his
march
to
Dunse
,
the
brigadier
rested
there
for
a
day
,
proclaimed
James
the
Third
,
collected
the
excise
dues
,
and
received
the
very
satisfactory
intelligence
that
Sir
William
Bennet
had
abandoned
Kelso
.
<EOS>
No
longer
troubled
by
the
Government
troops
,
and
renovated
by
the
much
-
needed
repose
,
he
marched
on
next
day
to
Kelso
,
and
was
met
at
Ednam
Bridge
,
as
we
have
related
,
by
the
Lowlanders
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
main
incidents
that
had
occurred
during
Mackintosh
's
memorable
march
towards
the
south
.
<EOS>
He
had
proved
himself
a
thoroughly
good
soldier
,
equal
to
every
emergency
,
and
not
to
be
checked
by
danger
or
difficulty
,
and
fully
deserved
the
encomiums
passed
upon
him
by
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
As
the
Highlanders
entered
Kelso
,
with
bagpipes
playing
,
colours
flying
,
and
drums
beating
,
the
inhabitants
flocked
forth
to
gaze
at
them
,
and
were
greatly
struck
by
the
stalwart
appearance
and
martial
bearing
of
the
men
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
of
whose
doings
so
much
had
been
heard
,
excited
great
curiosity
,
and
the
tall
figure
,
strongly
marked
features
,
and
athletic
limbs
of
the
veteran
warrior
would
have
pointed
him
out
to
all
beholders
,
even
if
he
had
not
marched
at
the
head
of
his
detachment
.
<EOS>
Throughout
their
progress
neither
the
brigadier
nor
any
of
his
officers
had
mounted
a
horse
,
but
marched
on
foot
with
the
men
and
crossed
all
rivers
in
their
Highland
garb
.
<EOS>
Amongst
those
who
attracted
most
attention
was
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
who
was
remarkable
for
his
graceful
person
and
good
looks
.
<EOS>
Lord
Nairn
and
some
of
the
subaltern
officers
were
also
thought
very
fine
men
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
Highlanders
generally
produced
a
favourable
impression
on
the
good
folks
of
Kelso
,
who
gave
them
a
far
warmer
welcome
than
they
had
accorded
to
their
allies
.
<EOS>
The
junction
between
the
confederate
forces
formed
a
curious
and
interesting
scene
.
<EOS>
When
the
brigadier
first
beheld
the
Northumbrian
detachment
drawn
up
in
the
market
-
place
,
he
was
struck
by
the
handsome
show
made
by
both
horses
and
men
,
but
when
he
began
to
scrutinise
them
,
he
quickly
changed
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
"Saul
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
body
!
<EOS>
this
will
never
do
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
to
Lord
Charles
Murray
.
"
<EOS>
Those
abalyiements
are
na
fit
for
war
.
<EOS>
Saw
ye
ever
before
a
dragoon
with
a
hunting
-
saddle
on
his
horse
's
back
,
a
toasting
-
fork
by
his
side
,
or
a
riding-
whip
in
his
hand
?
<EOS>
I
trow
not
.
<EOS>
They
should
get
basket
-
hilted
broad
swords
like
our
ain
,
saddles
wi
'
high
pommels
and
holsters
,
and
as
to
those
riding
-
whips
,
I
should
like
to
lay
them
across
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
men
certainly
look
better
equipped
for
flight
than
for
attack
,
"
replied
Lord
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
not
judge
them
too
harshly
.
<EOS>
They
may
fight
well
in
spite
of
their
dress
swords
,
and
charge
even
with
race
-
horses
.
<EOS>
""Vera
true
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
,
laughing
.
"
<EOS>
And
here
comes
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
""By
my
faith
!
<EOS>
he
looks
more
like
an
English
fox
-
hunter
than
a
soldier
,
"
remarked
Lord
Charles
,
in
an
undertone
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
how
they
came
to
choose
him
.
<EOS>
""They
<EOS>
couldna
help
it
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
was
the
right
man
,
yet
being
a
Papist
,
he
would
n't
do
.
<EOS>
"Attended
<EOS>
by
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
Lord
Nairn
,
Major
Forbes
,
and
Logie
Drummond
,
the
brigadier
stepped
forward
to
meet
General
Forster
,
who
was
closely
followed
by
Lord
Derwentwater
and
the
other
Northumbrian
officers
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
Lord
Kenmure
came
forward
,
and
presented
the
two
commanders
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
meeting
was
very
friendly
,
and
the
brigadier
praised
Forster
's
troops
,
but
told
him
plainly
he
ought
to
get
different
saddles
and
better
swords
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
we
will
,
as
soon
as
we
can
procure
them
,
"
replied
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
But
they
are
not
to
be
had
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
English
officers
were
next
presented
to
the
brigadier
,
who
seemed
best
pleased
with
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
moment
,
the
rough
old
soldier
conceived
a
friendship
for
the
young
noble
,
which
he
never
afterwards
lost
.
<EOS>
The
various
troops
marched
past
the
three
commanders
,
who
remained
for
some
time
longer
in
the
market
-
place
,
and
then
proceeded
to
their
quarters
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIISunday
at
KelsoAFTER
the
junction
of
the
confederate
forces
had
been
effected
,
it
was
found
that
they
formed
an
army
of
two
thousand
men
,
of
whom
the
majority
were
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
Though
the
force
was
still
small
,
so
much
confidence
was
now
felt
in
Mackintosh
,
and
such
strong
hopes
were
entertained
that
large
additions
would
soon
be
received
,
that
no
misgivings
were
felt
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
of
the
junction
,
the
commanders
and
officers
dined
together
,
and
the
best
feeling
was
manifested
.
<EOS>
All
old
jealousies
,
if
any
had
existed
,
were
banished
.
<EOS>
A
warm
tribute
was
paid
by
Lord
Derwentwater
to
the
valour
and
skill
of
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
with
which
the
veteran
warrior
was
much
gratified
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
being
Sunday
,
great
discretion
had
to
be
used
by
the
leaders
of
an
army
composed
of
Presbyterians
,
High
Church
Tories
,
and
Roman
Catholics
.
<EOS>
That
such
discordant
elements
could
be
reconciled
—
even
for
a
brief
season
—
seemed
impossible
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
by
the
judicious
management
of
Lord
Kenmure
,
who
retained
the
command
of
the
confederate
force
so
long
as
it
continued
in
Scotland
,
the
thing
was
accomplished
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
three
clergymen
were
attached
to
the
expedition
—
the
Reverend
William
Irvine
,
chaplain
to
the
Earl
of
Carnwath
,
an
Episcopalian
and
Nonjuror
—
the
Reverend
Robert
Patten
,
of
Allendale
,
who
belonged
to
the
High
Church
,
and
had
just
been
appointed
chaplain
to
General
Forster
—
and
<EOS>
the
Reverend
Mr.
Buxton
,
likewise
a
Church
of
England
divine
,
who
might
be
considered
chaplain
to
the
entire
English
force
,
since
there
was
no
Roman
Catholic
priest
.
<EOS>
By
Lord
Kenmure
's
orders
all
the
officers
and
men
attended
at
the
Great
Kirk
,
where
the
Church
of
England
service
was
performed
.
<EOS>
The
large
congregation
thus
assembled
presented
an
extraordinary
sight
,
and
the
behaviour
of
the
men
was
extremely
decorous
—
that
of
the
Highlanders
especially
so
.
<EOS>
They
nearly
filled
the
body
of
the
sacred
edifice
,
and
listened
with
devout
attention
to
the
discourse
of
Mr.
Patten
,
who
took
for
his
text
,
"
<EOS>
The
right
of
the
first
-
born
is
his"—applying
it
to
the
cause
for
which
they
were
fighting
.
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
,
an
equally
large
congregation
assembled
,
consisting
chiefly
of
Highlanders
,
to
hear
the
Reverend
William
Irvine
,
the
Scottish
Nonjuror
,
who
treated
them
to
a
sermon
he
had
preached
to
Lord
Dundee
before
the
battle
of
Killiecrankie
.
<EOS>
It
was
thought
that
this
fiery
sermon
was
given
in
deference
to
the
wishes
of
Brigadier
Mackintosh
;
and
it
would
almost
seem
so
,
since
the
old
Highlander
listened
to
it
with
profound
attention
,
and
afterwards
expressed
his
satisfaction
to
the
preacher
.
<EOS>
A
very
favourable
impression
was
produced
on
the
Kelso
folk
by
the
exemplary
conduct
of
the
troops
on
the
Sabbath
;
but
they
were
not
quite
so
well
pleased
when
Mackintosh
next
morning
,
while
searching
for
arms
,
discovered
several
barrels
of
gunpowder
concealed
in
the
vaults
of
the
kirk
,
and
swore
if
he
could
catch
the
traitors
who
had
placed
them
there
,
he
would
hang
them
like
dogs
.
<EOS>
The
brigadier
was
likewise
extraordinarily
active
in
foraging
and
plundering
,
and
seized
all
the
public
revenues
without
scruple
.
<EOS>
Under
other
circumstances
Lord
Derwentwater
would
have
enjoyed
his
visit
to
Kelso
,
but
his
mind
was
so
troubled
,
that
even
Roxburgh
Castle
,
Floors
,
or
the
charming
views
of
the
Tweed
and
the
Teviot
afforded
him
very
little
pleasure
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVA
Council
of
WarON
the
third
day
after
their
arrival
at
Kelso
,
one
of
the
scouts
sent
by
Lord
Kenmure
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
Government
troops
,
brought
word
that
General
Carpenter
had
reached
Wooler
with
a
force
of
nine
hundred
men
,
consisting
of
Hotham
's
regiment
of
foot
,
and
three
regiments
of
dragoons
,
and
intended
next
day
to
attack
Kelso
.
<EOS>
On
receipt
of
this
important
intelligence
,
a
council
of
war
was
immediately
summoned
,
which
was
attended
by
all
the
commanders
and
officers
.
<EOS>
The
main
point
to
be
considered
was
whether
they
should
await
the
English
general
's
attack
at
Kelso
,
and
barricade
the
town
,
or
cross
the
Tweed
,
and
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
was
decidedly
of
opinion
that
the
latter
course
should
be
adopted
,
and
maintained
that
their
force
being
double
that
of
Carpenter
,
<EOS>
the
result
of
an
engagement
could
not
be
doubtful
—
although
the
Government
general
possessed
three
regiments
of
experienced
dragoons
.
<EOS>
But
his
advice
,
though
approved
by
General
Forster
and
the
English
officers
,
was
opposed
by
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Scotsmen
,
"
said
his
lordship
,
"
we
are
best
able
to
serve
the
king
's
cause
in
our
own
country
,
and
are
therefore
most
reluctant
to
cross
the
Border
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
appealing
to
his
compatriots
—
all
of
whom
assented
,
except
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
have
the
Earl
of
Mar
's
orders
to
advance
,
"
remarked
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
disobey
<EOS>
them?""The
<EOS>
Earl
of
Mar
is
not
aware
of
our
exact
position
,
"
replied
Lord
Wintoun
,
"
or
his
orders
would
be
countermanded
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
all
communication
with
him
is
difficult
,
and
if
we
enter
England
it
will
be
entirely
cut
off
.
<EOS>
But
it
may
be
opened
—
and
this
is
the
plan
of
operation
I
would
recommend
.
<EOS>
Falling
back
to
the
north
-
west
,
attacking
Dumfries
and
Glasgow
on
our
way
,
we
shall
be
able
to
join
the
Western
Clans
,
and
,
combining
with
them
,
can
either
cross
the
Firth
above
Stirling
,
or
proceed
as
the
Earl
of
Mar
may
direct
.
<EOS>
"This
proposition
was
manifestly
to
the
taste
of
the
Scottish
leaders
,
most
of
whom
signified
their
approval
of
it
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
why
throw
away
our
present
chance
?
"
cried
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
attack
Carpenter
when
we
can
do
so
with
every
advantage
?
<EOS>
From
the
report
just
received
he
is
greatly
our
inferior
in
numbers
,
and
his
troops
are
exhausted
.
<EOS>
The
prestige
of
a
victory
would
be
of
immense
service
to
the
cause
.
<EOS>
""We
do
not
care
to
cross
the
Tweed
,
"
again
objected
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"If
you
wo
n't
cross
the
Tweed
,
my
lord
,
General
Carpenter
will
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Derwentwater
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"He
will
gain
little
by
the
movement
,
"
retorted
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
find
Kelso
evacuated
,
and
will
not
dare
follow
us
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
the
sort
of
fighting
<EOS>
we
are
to
expect
?
"
cried
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
Are
we
always
to
retreat
on
the
appearance
of
the
foe
?
<EOS>
We
Northumbrians
did
not
come
to
Scotland
to
join
the
Western
Clans
,
but
to
meet
our
brave
ally
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
who
is
pledged
to
march
with
us
to
London
,
and
we
claim
fulfilment
of
his
promise
.
<EOS>
As
to
General
Carpenter
,
if
our
allies
wo
n't
help
us
,
we
will
attack
him
alone
.
<EOS>
Do
I
not
express
your
sentiments
,
general
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
to
Forster
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
opinion
decidedly
is
,
that
Carpenter
ought
to
be
met
by
the
whole
confederate
force
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
My
own
division
is
not
strong
enough
to
encounter
him
,
and
would
incur
certain
defeat
.
<EOS>
""Again
,
I
say
,
the
Scots
will
not
cross
the
Tweed
,
"
remarked
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"
If
our
English
allies
choose
to
sacrifice
themselves
,
we
may
grieve
,
but
we
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
"Restraining
himself
with
difficulty
,
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
turned
to
Mackintosh
,
who
had
not
hitherto
spoken
,
and
said:"Do
you
mean
to
desert
us
,
brigadier?""No
,
my
lord
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"Then
let
the
Lowlanders
join
the
Western
Clans
if
they
will
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
do
without
them
.
<EOS>
"Lord
Wintoun
placed
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
the
other
Lowland
leaders
would
have
fiercely
resented
the
remark
,
if
Lord
Kenmure
had
not
interposed
.
<EOS>
"We
must
have
no
quarrels
among
ourselves
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
When
Lord
Derwentwater
becomes
calmer
,
he
will
regret
having
spoken
thus
hastily
.
<EOS>
As
yet
,
I
am
chief
in
command
of
the
whole
insurgent
force
,
and
my
orders
must
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
""They
shall
be
obeyed
by
me
,
my
lord
,
"
said
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
pray
you
not
to
take
us
further
into
Scotland
.
<EOS>
My
troops
will
assuredly
revolt
.
<EOS>
""We
will
come
to
a
decision
at
Jedburgh
,
"
said
Lord
Kenmure
,
somewhat
evasively
.
<EOS>
"
Meantime
,
precise
information
must
be
obtained
as
to
the
movements
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
You
shall
go
on
the
errand
,
Captain
Gordon
,
"
he
added
,
addressing
a
tall
,
exceedingly
handsome
young
man
in
the
Lowland
garb
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gordon
,
an
officer
in
the
Merse
troop
,
commanded
by
the
Honourable
Captain
Hume
,
and
distinguished
for
his
courage
and
activity
,
seemed
well
pleased
at
being
chosen
for
the
dangerous
expedition
.
<EOS>
"I
will
rejoin
your
lordship
at
Jedburgh
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
find
General
Carpenter
and
his
force
on
the
move
,
you
will
see
me
sooner
.
<EOS>
"With
this
<EOS>
he
bowed
and
quitted
the
room
,
and
almost
before
the
council
had
broken
up
,
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
Tweed
.
<EOS>
"Brigadier
,
"
said
General
Forster
,
addressing
Mackintosh
,
after
some
further
discussion
had
taken
place
;
"
before
we
separate
,
I
must
ask
you
plainly
if
you
mean
to
march
with
us
to
London?""I
will
answer
frankly
,
general
,
"
replied
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
My
men
will
never
enter
England
,
unless
they
are
certain
of
their
pay
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
that
the
only
difficulty
?
<EOS>
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
I
feared
from
what
has
been
said
,
that
they
might
be
averse
to
a
campaign
in
England
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
they
are
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
.
"
<EOS>
But
possibly
their
aversion
may
be
overcome
by
the
certainty
of
good
pay
.
<EOS>
""Make
<EOS>
them
quite
easy
on
that
score
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
provide
the
money
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
my
men
learn
your
lordship
's
generous
promise
,
"
said
Mackintosh
,
"
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
they
will
be
very
grateful
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
but
a
small
subsidy
to
the
king
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
my
whole
property
to
set
him
on
the
throne
.
<EOS>
""Truly
,
your
lordship
sets
us
all
a
good
example
,
which
we
ought
to
follow
,
"
said
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
for
Jedburgh!"About
an
hour
later
,
much
to
the
relief
of
the
inhabitants
,
who
began
to
fear
that
a
battle
would
be
fought
under
their
walls
,
the
whole
insurgent
force
quitted
Kelso
,
having
stayed
there
three
days
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VFurther
<EOS>
DissensionsTHE
<EOS>
Northumbrians
reached
their
destination
first
,
and
as
the
others
did
not
arrive
,
they
rode
back
to
see
what
had
happened
to
them
,
and
found
the
South
Country
Scots
drawn
up
on
the
road
about
two
miles
from
the
town
,
and
waiting
for
the
Highlanders
,
who
,
in
their
turn
,
had
halted
to
receive
General
Carpenter
—
believing
he
was
in
pursuit
.
<EOS>
These
false
alarms
caused
some
delay
,
but
eventually
the
whole
force
reached
Jedburgh
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
another
council
of
war
was
held
,
and
the
same
dissension
prevailed
as
before
,
threatening
to
end
in
a
rupture
among
the
chiefs
.
<EOS>
Previously
to
the
meeting
Lord
Wintoun
,
who
had
had
a
private
conference
with
Mackintosh
,
was
persuaded
that
the
brigadier
would
support
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
mistaken
—
the
old
warrior
would
not
desert
the
Northumbrians
,
though
it
was
evident
he
himself
was
unwilling
to
quit
Scotland
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
still
engaged
in
angry
and
fruitless
discussion
,
Captain
Gordon
returned
.
<EOS>
"What
news
<EOS>
do
you
bring
us
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Lord
Kenmure
.
"
<EOS>
Has
General
Carpenter
crossed
the
Border?""He
has
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Captain
Gordon
;
"
and
the
greater
part
of
his
force
is
quartered
at
the
Yetholms
within
eight
miles
of
this
place
.
<EOS>
Troops
are
cantoned
at
Hounham
,
Mendrum
,
Town
-
Yetholm
,
Kirk
-
Yetholm
,
and
Morbattle
,
as
I
myself
have
ascertained
.
<EOS>
I
ventured
so
near
them
at
Morbattle
,
that
I
was
discovered
,
and
pursued
by
a
dozen
of
Churchill
's
dragoons
,
within
two
miles
of
Jedburgh
,
when
they
gave
up
the
chase
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
they
believed
we
were
still
at
Kelso
,
but
they
must
now
have
found
out
their
mistake
.
<EOS>
""Captain
<EOS>
Gordon
,
"
said
Mackintosh
,
"
so
far
as
you
can
judge
,
what
is
the
condition
of
the
enemy?""Their
horses
are
jaded
,
or
I
should
not
have
escaped
,
"
replied
Gordon
,
"
and
I
am
certain
the
foot
,
of
whom
there
must
be
five
or
six
hundred
,
are
fatigued
with
their
long
march
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
feel
convinced
there
will
be
no
general
attack
today
,
and
I
think
we
might
surprise
them
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
hear
what
Captain
Gordon
says
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mackintosh
,
turning
to
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"
From
the
observations
he
has
just
made
,
he
is
of
opinion
we
may
surprise
the
enemy
.
""General
<EOS>
Carpenter
himself
is
at
Kirk
-
Yetholm
,
"
remarked
Captain
Gordon
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
much
the
better
,
"
said
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
Having
taken
up
a
position
there
,
he
will
make
no
further
advance
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Our
whole
force
is
in
marching
order
.
<EOS>
Let
us
make
the
attack
at
once
.
<EOS>
By
using
the
utmost
expedition
,
we
shall
take
him
unprepared
.
<EOS>
""That
is
certain
,
"
said
Captain
Gordon
;
"
and
<EOS>
I
do
not
<EOS>
for
a
moment
doubt
that
the
attack
will
be
successful
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
the
plan
meets
with
your
lordship
's
approval
?
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
to
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
The
chief
commander
,
however
,
made
no
direct
answer
,
but
turning
to
the
Northumbrian
leader
,
observed:"What
says
General
Forster?""'Tis
a
bold
step
,
and
requires
consideration
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
blow
must
be
struck
at
once
,
or
not
at
all
,
"
said
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
While
we
are
deliberating
,
the
chance
will
be
lost
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
have
not
sufficient
horse
,
"
rejoined
Forster
.
<EOS>
"We
have
enow
for
our
purpose
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
in
the
king
's
name
,
I
ask
you
to
make
the
attack
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
this
sounds
like
a
command
,
"
cried
Lord
Kenmure
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
own
general
hesitates
—
if
he
will
go
on
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
Heaven
's
sake
,
come
to
a
speedy
decision
!
"
said
the
earl
to
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
Every
minute
is
precious
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
risk
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
replied
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
run
headlong
into
a
danger
that
can
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
We
may
find
General
Carpenter
better
prepared
for
us
than
we
expect
.
<EOS>
His
dragoons
are
far
more
numerous
than
our
cavalry
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
our
horses
are
fresh
,
general
,
"
observed
Captain
Gordon
.
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
my
opinion
that
a
prompt
attack
would
be
successful
.
<EOS>
""I
wo
n't
hazard
it
,
"
said
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
your
lordship
refuses
to
lead
us
to
certain
victory
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
Lord
Kenmure
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"I
have
given
you
my
decision
,
and
I
shall
adhere
to
it
.
<EOS>
"Lord
Derwentwater
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
rage
.
<EOS>
Mackintosh
looked
equally
angry
,
but
felt
it
was
useless
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
"We
shall
be
better
prepared
on
some
future
day
,
"
observed
Forster
.
<EOS>
"Never
!
"
exclaimed
the
brigadier
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
Never
shall
we
be
better
prepared
than
now
!
<EOS>
Never
shall
we
have
the
enemy
at
greater
advantage!""At
<EOS>
all
events
,
let
us
stay
where
we
are
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
General
Carpenter
will
think
we
are
retreating
,
if
we
march
to
Hawick
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
will
he
be
far
wide
of
the
truth
,
if
he
does
think
so
,
"
said
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
But
these
expressions
of
disapproval
were
entirely
unheeded
,
and
the
march
to
Hawick
took
place
,
greatly
to
the
annoyance
of
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
,
his
lordship
requested
Captain
Gordon
to
accompany
him
,
and
set
off
with
a
small
party
of
horse
towards
the
Yetholms
.
<EOS>
Nothing
occurred
to
indicate
that
the
enemy
were
on
the
move
till
he
came
within
a
couple
of
miles
of
Kirk
-
Yetholm
,
when
,
from
the
brow
of
a
hill
,
he
distinguished
their
vanguard
,
and
at
once
comprehended
that
a
part
of
the
force
,
if
not
the
whole
,
must
be
marching
to
Kelso
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
what
he
had
seen
,
and
beginning
to
be
of
opinion
that
General
Carpenter
would
not
have
been
so
easily
surprised
as
he
imagined
,
he
turned
back
,
and
riding
quickly
,
overtook
the
insurgent
army
before
it
reached
Hawick
.
<EOS>
It
afterwards
appeared
that
the
earl
had
narrowly
escaped
capture
,
and
that
he
and
his
companions
were
indebted
for
their
escape
to
the
swiftness
of
their
horses
.
<EOS>
Had
he
descended
the
hill
whence
<EOS>
he
descried
the
enemy
,
he
must
have
been
taken
prisoner
.

CHAPTER
VIThe
Highlanders
refuse
to
cross
the
BorderNEXT
day
,
symptoms
of
revolt
began
to
appear
among
the
Highlanders
,
who
had
been
told
by
Lord
Wintoun
that
if
they
went
to
England
they
would
infallibly
be
defeated
by
the
superior
force
brought
against
them
,
and
would
either
be
cut
to
pieces
,
taken
prisoners
and
hanged
,
or
sold
as
slaves
to
the
plantations
.
<EOS>
Assembling
on
the
Moot
Hill
,
at
the
head
of
the
town
,
they
refused
to
come
down
,
even
at
the
orders
of
their
chief
,
and
told
him
if
they
were
led
against
the
enemy
they
would
fight
,
but
that
they
would
not
cross
the
Border
.
"Wherefore
<EOS>
not
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Why
the
devil
are
you
afraid
to
fight
the
Southrons
on
their
ain
ground
?
<EOS>
You
are
ready
to
meet
them
here
,
but
not
south
of
the
Solway
Firth
.
<EOS>
Your
pay
is
assured
you
,
and
it
will
be
your
ain
faut
if
ye
dinna
double
it
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
they
tell
us
we
shall
never
come
back
,
"
rejoined
the
sergeant
,
who
acted
as
spokesman
.
"Who
<EOS>
tells
you
so
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
who
knows
what
he
says
,
and
would
n't
deceive
us
,
"
replied
the
sergeant
.
<EOS>
"Zounds
,
man
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
would
deceive
you
?
"
cried
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
in
England
you
will
get
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
—
plenty
of
plunder
—
whereas
in
Scotland
you
have
nothing
but
starvation
to
expect
.
<EOS>
Now
choose
!
<EOS>
Will
you
follow
me
,
who
have
led
you
on
thus
far
triumphantly
,
and
will
lead
you
on
to
further
conquest
—
or
desert
me
,
when
I
most
need
your
services
,
for
one
who
has
neither
the
will
,
nor
the
power
to
reward
you?""We
will
follow
you
,
brigadier
,
"
shouted
the
majority
of
the
men
.
<EOS>
"
Take
us
where
you
will
.
<EOS>
""I
will
first
take
you
where
each
of
you
can
get
a
mutchkin
of
whisky
to
drink
the
king
's
health
.
<EOS>
You
will
then
prepare
to
march
to
Langholm
,
on
the
road
to
Longtown!"After
resting
for
the
night
at
Langholm
,
where
they
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
quarters
,
the
insurgents
continued
their
march
next
day
,
uncertain
whether
they
should
proceed
to
Langholm
or
Ecclefechan
,
when
a
decision
was
unexpectedly
brought
about
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIILord
Widdrington
returns
from
LancashireWHILE
crossing
a
wide
moor
,
they
perceived
a
party
of
horsemen
coming
towards
them
,
and
understood
from
the
shouts
of
these
persons
that
they
must
be
friends
.
<EOS>
On
a
nearer
approach
the
insurgents
discovered
that
the
leader
of
the
party
was
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
returned
from
his
visit
to
Lancashire
,
and
had
brought
with
him
a
very
important
document
,
which
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
show
to
the
leaders
of
the
expedition
,
as
it
could
not
fail
to
govern
their
future
plans
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
a
general
halt
was
called
,
and
the
commanders
and
officers
having
assembled
,
Lord
Widdrington
read
his
paper
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
the
effect
,
that
if
the
combined
forces
of
the
Scottish
Lowlanders
and
Highlanders
,
who
had
risen
for
King
James
the
Third
,
would
direct
their
march
to
Lancashire
,
the
High
Church
Tories
of
Manchester
and
the
neighbourhood
,
and
the
whole
of
the
Roman
Catholic
gentry
of
Lancashire
and
Cheshire
,
would
rise
in
a
mass
,
and
join
them
with
an
army
of
twenty
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
"Twenty
thousand
men
!
"
exclaimed
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
certain
of
this
,
my
lord?""I
am
certain
that
our
appearance
in
Lancashire
will
be
the
signal
of
a
general
rising
,
"
replied
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
very
strong
Jacobite
feeling
throughout
the
county
.
<EOS>
But
the
inhabitants
will
not
rise
till
we
appear
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
we
must
go
to
Lancashire
,
"
said
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
three
days
we
shall
be
in
the
heart
of
the
county
,
"
said
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
surrounded
by
a
host
of
friends
,
"
cried
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
promises
from
all
quarters
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
see
that
this
document
bears
a
number
of
important
names
.
<EOS>
The
first
signature
is
that
of
my
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Mr.
Townley
,
of
Townley
.
<EOS>
The
second
is
that
of
Mr.
Ralph
Standish
,
of
Standish
.
<EOS>
Next
follows
Sir
Francis
Anderton
,
of
Lostock
.
<EOS>
Then
come
Mr.
Shuttleworth
,
of
Shuttleworth
,
Mr.
Richard
Chorley
,
of
Chorley
,
Mr.
Gabriel
Hesketh
,
of
Whitehall
,
near
St.
Michael's
-
le
-
Wyre
,
and
Mr.
John
Leyburne
,
of
Natesby
—
all
men
of
good
family
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
all
Roman
Catholics
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"True
,
my
lord
—
but
they
are
none
the
worse
for
their
religion
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
many
other
names
on
the
list
.
<EOS>
Pray
look
at
the
document
.
<EOS>
""It
is
not
needful
,
"
replied
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
the
others
,
he
added
,
"
I
am
of
opinion
that
we
ought
forthwith
to
quit
Scotland
and
march
to
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
my
lords
and
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
Shall
it
be
so?"A
<EOS>
hearty
response
was
given
in
the
affirmative
,
with
but
one
dissentient
voice
—
that
of
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"I
am
still
as
much
opposed
to
the
plan
as
ever
,
"
said
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
entire
faith
in
Lord
Widdrington
's
representations
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
is
incapable
of
deceiving
us
;
but
I
place
no
reliance
on
the
promises
of
support
he
has
received
.
<EOS>
If
the
Lancashire
Jacobites
meant
to
rise
,
they
would
not
wait
for
our
coming
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
know
them
as
well
as
I
do
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
they
are
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
""If
you
<EOS>
despair
of
the
expedition
,
my
lord
,
leave
it
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
not
throw
cold
water
upon
it
.
<EOS>
""No
,
it
shall
never
be
said
that
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
deserted
King
James
's
cause
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
bitterly
regret
that
you
did
not
follow
my
counsel
.
<EOS>
""Meantime
,
we
are
well
content
to
march
to
Lancashire
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
to
Lancashire
!
<EOS>
to
Lancashire
!
"
cried
several
voices
.
<EOS>
The
matter
being
now
settled
,
orders
were
given
to
march
to
Langholm
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
however
,
had
a
difficult
task
to
get
his
men
to
move
.
<EOS>
When
they
understood
it
was
decided
that
the
force
should
march
into
England
,
a
portion
of
the
Highlanders
again
rebelled
,
and
refused
to
proceed
further
.
<EOS>
Once
more
the
brigadier
tried
the
effect
of
persuasion
,
and
partly
by
promises
—
partly
by
threats
—
induced
the
men
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
They
went
on
very
reluctantly
for
three
or
four
miles
,
till
they
drew
near
the
Esk
,
when
the
mutineers
separating
themselves
from
their
comrades
,
ran
towards
the
river
,
with
the
intention
of
crossing
it
and
flying
towards
Ecclefechan
.
<EOS>
But
the
brigadier
was
beforehand
with
them
,
and
plunging
into
the
stream
,
drew
his
sword
,
and
swore
he
would
cut
down
the
first
who
entered
the
water
.
<EOS>
His
aspect
was
so
grim
and
terrible
that
he
held
them
in
check
for
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
he
was
able
to
reassert
his
authority
,
and
eventually
he
succeeded
in
driving
a
great
number
of
them
back
to
the
ranks
.
<EOS>
The
confederate
forces
halted
at
Langholm
,
but
did
not
rest
there
for
the
night
,
as
it
was
deemed
advisable
by
the
Scottish
leaders
to
enter
England
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
marched
on
to
Longtown
,
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
On
that
very
day
,
Brigadier
Stanwix
,
Governor
of
Carlisle
,
with
sixty
militiamen
,
had
ridden
over
to
Longtown
,
but
could
obtain
no
precise
information
respecting
the
movements
of
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
heard
of
at
Hawick
,
but
it
was
thought
they
would
turn
to
the
west
,
and
crossing
the
mountains
join
the
Earl
of
Mar.
<EOS>
No
suspicion
was
entertained
that
they
were
marching
into
England
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
as
we
have
shown
,
their
own
plans
were
undecided
,
until
they
met
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
General
Carpenter
likewise
was
misled
by
the
intelligence
he
received
,
and
followed
the
insurgents
no
further
than
Jedburgh
.
<EOS>
Receiving
no
further
tidings
,
and
being
in
great
want
of
forage
for
his
troops
,
he
then
returned
to
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
Thus
owing
to
a
variety
of
circumstances
,
the
rebels
gained
two
days
on
their
enemies
.
<EOS>
They
took
every
possible
precaution
to
prevent
their
arrival
at
Longtown
from
becoming
known
,
and
were
marching
joyously
to
Brampton
,
in
Gilsland
—
a
small
place
near
Naworth
Castle
—
before
it
was
even
suspected
they
were
in
England
.

THE
MARCH
FROM
PENRITH
TO
PRESTONCHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
Rout
on
Penrith
FellHAVING
achieved
a
great
point
,
as
they
thought
,
the
insurgents
were
now
in
very
good
spirits
.
<EOS>
Even
the
Highlanders
had
quite
recovered
from
their
superstitious
dread
of
crossing
the
Border
,
and
gazed
with
curiosity
at
the
country
as
they
marched
along
—
thinking
it
very
like
Scotland
.
<EOS>
But
they
abstained
from
any
acts
of
pillage
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
regarded
them
with
terror
,
and
fancied
they
were
the
first
part
of
a
large
invading
army
.
<EOS>
Brampton
offered
them
very
poor
quarters
and
a
scanty
supply
of
provisions
,
and
they
thought
of
seizing
Naworth
Castle
,
which
was
only
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
,
but
some
prudential
considerations
deterred
them
.
<EOS>
James
the
Third
having
been
proclaimed
,
Mr.
Forster
opened
his
commission
to
act
as
General
of
the
Confederate
Forces
in
England
,
and
Lord
Kenmure
resigned
the
post
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
the
insurgents
quitted
Brampton
betimes
,
and
continued
their
march
along
the
banks
of
the
Eden
.
<EOS>
At
Kirkoswald
they
halted
in
expectation
of
being
joined
by
Mr.
Dacre
,
a
Roman
Catholic
gentleman
,
with
forty
men
.
<EOS>
While
at
Kirkoswald
,
they
received
information
from
Captain
Gordon
,
who
had
gone
on
to
reconnoitre
,
that
Lord
Lonsdale
,
commander
of
the
militia
of
Westmoreland
,
Cumberland
,
and
Northumberland
,
with
five
or
six
hundred
horse
militia
,
and
accompanied
by
the
Bishop
of
Carlisle
,
and
Sir
Christopher
Musgrave
,
high
sheriff
of
the
county
,
with
an
immense
posse
-
comitatus
,
consisting
probably
of
eight
or
ten
thousand
men
,
armed
with
bills
and
pitchforks
and
such
implements
as
they
could
procure
,
were
assembled
on
Penrith
Fell
,
to
dispute
their
further
advance
.
<EOS>
Little
danger
was
to
be
apprehended
from
this
vast
but
disorderly
host
,
in
Captain
Gordon
's
opinion
,
as
,
except
the
militia
,
which
formed
only
a
small
proportion
of
it
,
the
men
were
entirely
undisciplined
,
and
scarcely
under
control
.
<EOS>
Since
it
was
clear
from
this
statement
that
the
hostile
force
would
be
as
easily
dispersed
as
a
mob
,
strict
orders
were
given
that
no
injury
should
be
done
to
the
common
men
,
except
in
case
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
All
eagerness
for
the
fight
<EOS>
—
if
fight
there
was
to
be
—
the
insurgents
set
forward
,
Lord
Derwentwater
commanding
the
advanced
guard
,
and
having
with
him
—
besides
his
brother
—
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
Captain
Gordon
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
commanded
the
main
force
,
and
rode
with
Lord
Widdrington
and
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
Neither
commanders
nor
officers
had
the
slightest
anxiety
as
to
the
result
of
the
engagement
,
and
felt
as
if
they
were
going
to
a
race
,
while
the
Highlanders
were
in
very
good
spirits
,
fancying
they
should
obtain
some
booty
.
<EOS>
After
passing
through
a
woody
district
,
they
came
to
a
common
,
when
they
perceived
the
immense
host
described
by
Capain
Gordon
,
drawn
up
on
the
side
of
Penrith
Fell
—
the
horse
militia
being
stationed
in
front
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
rebels
came
in
sight
,
the
Royalists
set
up
a
great
shout
,
and
a
charge
being
ordered
by
Lord
Lonsdale
,
the
militia
dashed
forward
,
sword
in
hand
,
as
if
meaning
to
cut
down
the
invaders
.
<EOS>
But
when
they
beheld
Lord
Derwentwater
at
the
head
of
his
troop
,
galloping
to
meet
them
,
they
suddenly
stopped
,
and
despite
Lord
Lonsdale
's
remonstrances
,
fairly
turned
round
,
and
fled
.
<EOS>
Their
cowardice
saved
the
rebels
the
trouble
of
dispersing
the
multitude
behind
them
,
for
no
sooner
did
the
militia
fly
,
than
the
others
took
to
their
heels
,
and
throwing
down
their
weapons
,
hurried
off
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
Ere
many
minutes
the
whole
common
was
covered
with
fugitives
,
crying
out
piteously
for
quarter
if
a
Highlander
pursued
them
,
and
offering
all
they
had
—
which
was
not
much
—
if
their
lives
were
spared
.
<EOS>
A
great
number
of
prisoners
were
taken
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
foremost
to
save
themselves
were
Lord
Lonsdale
and
the
Bishop
of
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
Both
were
greatly
afraid
of
being
captured
.
<EOS>
Sir
Christopher
Musgrave
made
a
vigorous
effort
to
check
the
flight
of
the
posse
-
comitatus
,
but
being
utterly
unable
to
do
so
,
he
rode
off
himself
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
half
an
hour
the
plain
was
completely
cleared
of
all
but
the
confederate
forces
and
their
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Several
horses
belonging
to
the
militia
were
taken
,
a
few
swords
and
pistols
,
and
a
vast
number
of
pitchforks
.
<EOS>
When
the
prisoners
,
who
amounted
to
three
or
four
hundred
,
were
brought
before
General
Forster
,
he
upbraided
them
—
though
in
a
good
-
humoured
manner
—
with
their
folly
in
opposing
their
friends
,
saying
they
—
the
so
-
called
rebels
—
were
come
to
deliver
them
from
a
tyrannical
usurper
,
and
restore
their
lawful
king
to
the
throne
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
prove
that
we
mean
you
no
harm
,
"
he
said
,
"
not
one
of
you
has
been
injured
—
not
a
single
man
has
been
killed
in
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
Had
we
caught
Lord
Lonsdale
,
or
the
Bishop
of
Carlisle
,
who
ought
not
to
have
appeared
on
a
field
of
battle
,
or
Sir
Christopher
Musgrave
,
we
might
have
made
each
of
them
pay
a
heavy
ransom
;
but
we
shall
deal
differently
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
free
.
<EOS>
Return
quietly
to
your
homes
.
<EOS>
Take
back
your
implements
of
husbandry
,
and
employ
them
to
a
better
purpose
in
future
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
speech
produced
a
very
good
effect
on
the
countrymen
to
whom
it
was
addressed
.
<EOS>
They
huzzaed
loudly
,
and
shouted:"God
save
King
James
the
Third
,
and
prosper
<EOS>
his
merciful
army!"Their
pitchforks
were
then
given
back
to
them
,
and
they
departed
,
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
Three
parties
of
horse
were
next
sent
off
in
different
directions
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
commanded
by
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
whose
orders
were
to
proceed
to
Lowther
Castle
,
which
was
not
more
than
three
or
four
miles
distant
,
and
search
for
his
lordship
,
and
take
him
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
second
party
,
commanded
by
Captain
Wogan
,
attended
by
the
Reverend
Mr.
Patten
,
who
was
acquainted
with
the
country
,
had
orders
to
proceed
to
Rose
Castle
,
the
residence
of
the
Bishop
of
Carlisle
,
and
arrest
him
.
<EOS>
The
third
party
was
commanded
by
Captain
Gordon
,
who
had
displayed
extraordinary
zeal
of
late
,
and
had
risen
greatly
in
favour
with
General
Forster
and
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gordon
's
orders
were
to
proceed
to
Edenhall
,
and
make
Sir
Christopher
Musgrave
prisoner
.
<EOS>
He
was
also
to
bring
away
any
arms
he
might
find
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Charged
with
these
orders
the
three
officers
in
question
immediately
rode
off
.
<EOS>
Elated
by
their
success
,
the
insurgents
marched
on
to
Penrith
,
and
entered
the
town
with
colours
flying
,
drums
beating
,
bagpipes
playing
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIMadam
BellinghamTHE
news
of
their
victory
had
preceded
them
,
and
disposed
the
inhabitants
—
many
of
whom
were
Jacobites
—
to
receive
them
cordially
.
<EOS>
Even
by
the
leading
men
of
the
opposite
party
the
greatest
civility
was
shown
them
.
<EOS>
In
anticipation
of
the
defeat
of
the
rebels
,
a
plentiful
supper
had
been
provided
at
the
principal
inn
for
the
Bishop
of
Carlisle
,
Lord
Lonsdale
,
Sir
Christopher
Musgrave
,
and
their
chief
followers
.
<EOS>
To
this
supper
General
Forster
and
the
whole
of
the
insurgent
leaders
—
except
those
absent
on
duty
—
sat
down
;
and
as
circumstances
gave
peculiar
zest
to
the
entertainment
,
they
passed
the
merriest
evening
they
had
done
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
The
party
sat
late
,
and
had
not
broken
up
when
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
the
two
other
officers
returned
.
<EOS>
Some
arms
were
brought
from
Lowther
Castle
and
Edenhall
—
but
no
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Lord
Lowther
,
it
appeared
,
had
fled
to
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
What
had
become
of
the
Bishop
of
Carlisle
and
Sir
Christopher
Musgrave
could
not
be
ascertained
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
was
greatly
disappointed
,
as
he
felt
that
the
capture
of
three
such
important
personages
—
or
even
one
of
them
—
would
have
given
him
great
credit
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
was
fain
to
be
content
with
the
success
he
had
achieved
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
the
general
performed
an
act
that
raised
him
considerably
in
the
estimation
of
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
Having
found
out
that
some
High
Church
Tories
belonging
to
his
own
division
intended
to
pull
down
,
or
burn
a
Presbyterian
meeting
-
house
in
the
town
,
he
peremptorily
forbade
them
,
declaring
he
would
punish
any
who
disobeyed
his
orders
.
<EOS>
"I
will
never
sanction
religious
outrages
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
show
the
country
that
all
sects
can
live
tranquilly
together
.
<EOS>
My
maxim
is
toleration
.
<EOS>
Though
I
differ
with
the
Presbyterians
,
I
will
,
on
no
account
,
allow
them
to
be
molested
.
<EOS>
"This
expression
,
which
was
repeated
,
did
him
great
service
.
<EOS>
During
their
stay
in
Penrith
,
the
insurgents
were
very
well
treated
,
and
made
many
friends
.
<EOS>
They
expected
to
be
joined
by
several
important
Roman
Catholics
—
Mr.
Howard
of
Corby
Castle
,
Mr.
Warwick
of
Warwick
Hall
,
Mr.
Henry
Curwen
of
Workington
,
and
Sir
James
Graham
of
Inchbrachy
—
but
learnt
to
their
dismay
that
they
had
all
been
arrested
by
the
Governor
of
Carlisle
,
and
secured
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
Penrith
,
they
collected
five
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
At
the
charming
town
of
Appleby
,
always
noted
for
its
loyalty
,
they
were
very
well
received
,
and
took
possession
of
the
church
and
castle
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
immediately
caused
James
the
Third
to
be
proclaimed
,
and
so
much
enthusiasm
was
manifested
that
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
inhabitants
were
all
devoted
to
the
Stuarts
.
<EOS>
Gratified
by
their
reception
,
and
delighted
by
the
beauty
of
the
town
,
the
insurgents
passed
their
time
very
pleasantly
,
and
were
reluctant
to
proceed
on
their
march
.
<EOS>
At
Appleby
,
Mr.
Wyburgh
,
captain
of
the
train
-
bands
,
was
taken
prisoner
,
and
Lord
Nairn
,
a
relation
of
Sir
James
Graham
,
wished
to
effect
an
exchange
,
but
the
Governor
of
Carlisle
would
not
listen
to
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
Several
persons
,
suspected
of
being
spies
,
were
seized
and
detained
,
and
an
impracticable
officer
was
confined
in
the
Moot
Hall
till
he
confessed
where
the
excise
money
was
lodged
.
<EOS>
Their
next
march
was
to
Kendal
,
where
General
Forster
was
quartered
at
the
house
of
Alderman
Simpson
,
in
Strickland
Gate
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
his
godmother
,
Mrs.
Bellingham
,
was
staying
there
at
the
time
,
and
hearing
this
the
general
desired
to
pay
his
respects
to
her
,
but
she
refused
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
he
was
going
up
-
stairs
to
his
room
,
she
rushed
forth
,
and
met
him
on
the
landing
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
furious
expression
of
her
countenance
,
Forster
would
have
turned
back
,
but
she
commanded
him
to
stay
.
<EOS>
Thinking
to
deprecate
her
wrath
,
the
general
expressed
his
great
pleasure
at
seeing
her
,
and
hoped
she
was
quite
well
.
"Quite
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
be
well
when
I
'm
driven
almost
out
of
my
senses
by
your
shameful
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Tom
,
Tom
!
<EOS>
never
did
I
think
you
would
serve
the
Pretender!""I
serve
King
James
the
Third
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
And
however
disagreeable
it
may
be
to
you
to
hear
it
,
I
must
say
that
I
look
upon
the
Elector
of
Hanover
as
a
usurper
,
and
I
shall
do
my
best
to
drive
him
from
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
""You
may
try
,
but
you
'll
never
succeed
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Bellingham
,
becoming
still
more
exasperated
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
've
lost
by
your
folly
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
leave
you
all
my
fortune
;
but
you
sha
n't
have
a
penny
.
<EOS>
I
'll
leave
it
all
to
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
""I'm
<EOS>
sorry
to
have
offended
you
,
madam
,
but
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
think
you
can
have
heard
of
our
great
success
at
Penrith
Fells
,
or
you
would
n't
speak
so
disparagingly
of
us
.
<EOS>
""I've
heard
that
you
dispersed
an
army
of
peasants
,
"
she
rejoined
,
contemptuously
.
"
<EOS>
But
when
you
face
a
regular
army
,
the
result
will
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mistaken
,
madam
,
"
he
rejoined
,
beginning
to
feel
angry
himself
,
for
he
saw
Lord
Derwentwater
,
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
and
felt
sure
they
must
be
laughing
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
Before
a
month
we
shall
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
you
will
be
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
You
and
the
rebel
lords
will
be
safely
lodged
in
the
Tower
,
and
if
you
come
out
,
it
will
only
be
to
have
your
heads
cut
off
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
richly
deserve
your
fate
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
good
word
may
be
said
for
the
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
It
was
reported
that
the
muskets
of
the
militia
were
concealed
in
the
church
,
and
a
party
of
these
brave
fellows
went
in
search
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
discovered
no
arms
,
but
they
found
the
plate
in
the
vestry
,
and
left
it
untouched
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
being
Sunday
,
the
insurgents
marched
early
to
Kirkby
-
Lonsdale
.
<EOS>
Service
was
performed
at
the
church
in
the
afternoon
by
the
Reverend
Mr.
Patten
,
and
as
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Widdrington
were
standing
in
the
churchyard
contemplating
the
beautiful
view
it
commands
of
the
valley
of
the
Lune
,
they
were
surprised
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
Lord
Widdrington
's
brother
,
who
had
just
returned
from
Lancaster
,
whither
he
had
been
sent
to
prepare
the
inhabitants
for
the
approach
of
the
insurgent
force
.
<EOS>
Charles
Widdrington
's
report
was
that
there
was
a
strong
feeling
in
their
favour
,
and
that
they
would
certainly
be
joined
by
many
gentlemen
of
the
county
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
brought
a
letter
to
Lord
Widdrington
from
Mr.
Charles
Beswicke
,
of
Manchester
,
in
which
the
writer
mentioned
that
King
James
the
Third
had
just
been
proclaimed
in
that
town
,
and
a
troop
of
fifty
men
raised
and
armed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Beswicke
hoped
to
join
the
insurgent
army
with
some
volunteers
at
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
This
satisfactory
intelligence
was
immediately
communicated
to
the
other
chiefs
and
officers
,
and
greatly
raised
their
spirits
.
<EOS>
Before
leaving
Kirkby
-
Lonsdale
,
they
were
joined
by
an
important
Roman
Catholic
gentleman
,
Mr.
Carus
,
of
Halton
Hall
,
and
his
two
sons
,
who
were
appointed
officers
in
Lord
Derwentwater
's
troop
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIIHornby
CastleWHILE
the
rest
of
the
force
proceeded
to
Lancaster
,
shaping
their
course
along
the
lovely
valley
of
the
Lune
,
and
keeping
near
the
banks
of
the
river
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
with
a
party
of
horse
,
composed
entirely
of
gentlemen
,
went
to
Hornby
Castle
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
its
owner
,
Colonel
Charteris
,
and
taking
him
a
prisoner
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Charteris
,
condemned
to
deathless
infamy
by
Hogarth
,
belonged
to
a
Scotch
family
,
and
had
rendered
himself
so
odious
to
his
countrymen
by
his
vices
,
that
,
if
the
Highlanders
had
been
allowed
to
visit
Hornby
Castle
,
they
would
undoubtedly
have
burnt
it
to
the
ground
,
and
have
shot
its
owner
if
they
had
caught
him
.
<EOS>
A
profligate
debauchee
of
the
worst
kind
,
Colonel
Charteris
was
also
one
of
the
meanest
of
men
,
and
cunning
as
mean
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
very
rich
,
and
about
two
years
prior
to
the
date
of
our
story
,
he
had
purchased
Hornby
Castle
,
where
he
now
dwelt
,
from
the
Earl
of
Cardigan
,
for
fifteen
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
some
alterations
—
but
not
improvements
—
in
the
place
,
and
had
disfigured
the
old
keep
by
rearing
a
watch
-
tower
on
its
summit
,
above
which
he
fixed
a
great
gilt
eagle
.
<EOS>
From
its
bold
position
on
a
craggy
hill
,
the
sides
of
which
were
clothed
with
timber
,
while
its
base
was
washed
by
the
river
Wenning
,
Hornby
Castle
,
before
its
partial
demolition
in
the
Civil
Wars
,
must
have
presented
a
very
striking
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
ancient
part
of
the
structure
was
now
in
ruins
—
all
that
remained
of
it
being
a
few
picturesque
walls
overgrown
with
ivy
,
and
the
great
square
tower
,
to
which
allusion
has
just
been
made
.
<EOS>
Adjoining
these
ruins
,
and
to
a
certain
degree
combined
with
them
,
was
a
large
modern
stone
mansion
,
in
front
of
which
a
steep
lawn
descended
,
between
avenues
of
timber
,
to
the
park
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
No
information
respecting
Colonel
Charteris
could
be
obtained
at
the
pretty
little
village
of
Hornby
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
tell
whether
he
was
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
uncertainty
that
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
his
troop
mounted
the
steep
ascent
.
<EOS>
The
probability
,
indeed
,
seemed
that
a
person
so
cautious
as
Colonel
Charteris
would
have
decamped
on
hearing
that
the
insurgents
were
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
the
castle
,
which
he
thought
much
too
good
for
its
unworthy
owner
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
rode
up
to
the
principal
entrance
and
caused
the
bell
to
be
loudly
rung
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
no
servants
had
appeared
from
whom
inquiries
could
be
made
,
and
it
would
almost
seem
that
the
place
was
deserted
.
<EOS>
The
summons
,
however
,
was
promptly
answered
by
a
porter
,
who
stated
that
his
master
had
gone
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
"Who
is
in
the
castle
,
then
?
"
demanded
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
Take
care
you
do
n't
deceive
me
,
fellow
.
<EOS>
""Only
<EOS>
Mr.
Bancroft
,
the
steward
,
and
two
old
women
,
"
replied
the
porter
.
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Charteris
has
taken
all
the
rest
of
the
servants
with
him
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
But
here
comes
Mr.
Bancroft
.
<EOS>
"As
he
spoke
,
a
singular
-
looking
individual
made
his
appearance
,
and
descending
the
steps
respectfully
saluted
the
insurgent
leader
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Bancroft
was
an
elderly
man
,
rather
high
-
shouldered
,
and
clad
in
an
old-
fashioned
,
snuff
-
coloured
suit
.
<EOS>
He
wore
what
was
then
called
a
night
-

and
on
his
large
and
prominent
nose
rested
a
pair
of
green
spectacles
,
through
which
he
eyed
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
"Colonel
<EOS>
Charteris
is
absent
,
sir
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
went
to
Lancaster
yesterday
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
have
just
heard
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
you
must
excuse
me
,
Mr.
Bancroft
,
if
I
decline
to
take
your
assurance
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
My
men
will
search
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
please
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
steward
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
may
depend
upon
it
they
wo
n't
find
him
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
please
to
alight
,
and
come
in?""Such
<EOS>
is
my
intention
,
"
replied
the
colonel
,
springing
from
his
horse
and
giving
the
bridle
to
the
trooper
nearest
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
a
dozen
men
follow
me
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
The
rest
will
take
the
horses
to
the
stable
-
feed
them
—
and
then
come
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
,
colonel
,
"
said
the
trooper
.
<EOS>
"Excuse
<EOS>
me
,
colonel
,
"
said
Bancroft
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
find
the
stable
doors
locked
.
<EOS>
My
master
has
taken
the
keys
with
him
.
<EOS>
""Break
<EOS>
open
the
doors
,
"
cried
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
they
do
,
they
'll
find
no
forage
inside
,
"
said
Bancroft
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
hay
and
corn
has
been
removed
.
<EOS>
""Never
was
there
such
a
rascal
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
do
the
best
you
can
,
"
he
added
,
to
his
followers
.
<EOS>
"
Put
up
the
horses
,
and
then
come
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
""To
prevent
disappointment
,
"
said
Bancroft
,
with
a
malicious
grin
,
"
I
had
better
mention
beforehand
that
they
will
find
no
provisions
.
<EOS>
""No
provisions
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
colonel
,
while
the
troopers
who
were
within
hearing
looked
aghast
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
larder
's
empty
,
sir
,
I
'm
sorry
to
say
,
"
pursued
the
steward
;
"
and
what
's
worse
,
there
's
not
a
bottle
of
wine
in
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
"Murmurs
<EOS>
and
threats
arose
from
the
men
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
your
master
acts
thus
,
he
must
take
the
consequences
,
"
observed
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
deserves
the
bad
character
he
has
acquired
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
steward
did
not
like
the
tone
in
which
the
remark
was
made
,
and
looked
as
if
he
would
be
glad
to
escape
,
but
this
being
impossible
,
he
asked
Colonel
Oxburgh
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
hall
with
his
men
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
stopped
him
,
and
said:"A
word
with
you
,
Mr.
Bancroft
.
<EOS>
You
say
there
are
no
provisions
in
the
house
—
no
food
for
the
horses
in
the
stables
.
<EOS>
""I
do
,
colonel
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"I
wo
n't
dispute
the
truth
of
your
statement
,
but
I
have
some
orders
to
give
you
,
which
you
will
be
pleased
to
execute
.
<EOS>
While
I
search
the
house
see
that
a
plentiful
repast
is
set
out
for
me
and
my
followers
in
the
dining
-
room—""I
can
not
accomplish
impossibilities
,
colonel
,
"
interrupted
the
steward
.
<EOS>
"I
require
good
wine
for
myself
and
my
men
.
<EOS>
No
discussion
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
done
.
<EOS>
Two
of
my
party
will
attend
upon
you
,
and
shoot
you
through
the
head
if
you
attempt
to
escape
.
<EOS>
The
rest
will
remain
with
me
.
"Leaving
<EOS>
the
steward
quite
confounded
by
what
he
had
heard
,
in
charge
of
a
couple
of
troopers
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
made
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
,
peering
into
every
room
,
but
he
did
not
find
the
person
he
sought
,
and
began
to
think
Colonel
Charteris
had
really
fled
.
<EOS>
On
repairing
to
the
dining
-
room
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
a
cold
collation
laid
out
on
a
long
table
.
<EOS>
"Aha
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Bancroft
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
"
you
have
performed
wonders
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
Is
this
the
work
of
magic?""It
turned
out
on
examination
that
the
larder
was
better
furnished
than
I
imagined
,
colonel
,
"
said
the
steward
.
<EOS>
"I
thought
as
much
,
"
rejoined
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
we
shall
not
fare
badly
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
will
the
horses
,
colonel
,
"
observed
one
of
the
gentlemen
troopers
coming
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
found
plenty
of
fodder
in
the
stable
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
colonel
laughed
heartily
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
do
you
say
to
this
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
remarked
to
the
steward
.
<EOS>
"Simply
,
that
I
obeyed
my
master
's
orders
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Your
master
is
a
miserable
niggard
,
"
said
the
colonel
,
signing
to
his
followers
to
sit
down
,
and
taking
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
They
were
waited
on
by
a
couple
of
men
servants
,
who
had
been
discovered
in
the
butler
's
pantry
,
and
were
supplied
with
abundance
of
claret
.
<EOS>
At
the
conclusion
of
the
repast
King
James
's
health
was
drunk
by
the
whole
party
with
loud
cheers
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
the
steward
compelled
to
join
in
the
toast
,
but
to
drink
"
Success

the
insurgent
army
.
<EOS>
"When
the
moment
of
departure
arrived
,
and
the
steward
thought
he
was
about
to
get
rid
of
his
unwelcome
visitors
<EOS>
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
said
to
him:"We
sha
n't
part
company
at
present
,
Mr.
Bancroft
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
compelled
to
take
you
with
me
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
""As
a
prisoner
,
colonel?""As
a
prisoner
,
sir!""But
<EOS>
what
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
What
crime
have
I
committed?""That
General
Forster

<EOS>
I
have
his
orders
to
arrest
you

<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
orders
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
are
to
arrest
Colonel
Charteris
.
<EOS>
""Exactly
.
<EOS>
But
in
arresting
you
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
be
far
wrong
.
<EOS>
""I
can
assure
you
,
sir?""Nay
,
'
tis
vain
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
I
suspected
you
were
Colonel
Charteris
,
and
my
suspicions
have
since
become
confirmed
.
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Twill
be
best
to
accompany
me
quietly
.
<EOS>
Resistance
will
be
useless
.
<EOS>
""Very
<EOS>
well
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
Since
you
have
seen
through
my
disguise
,
I
wo
n't
attempt
to
maintain
it
longer
.
<EOS>
I
am
Colonel
Charteris
.
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
put
up
a
few
things
,
and
I
will
go
with
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
alarmed
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
my
word
of
honour
I
will
return
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
word
of
honour
!
"
exclaimed
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
contemptuously
,
"
I
place
little
reliance
upon
it
.
<EOS>
A
guard
must
accompany
you
while
you
make
your
preparations
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
wrong
me
by
this
distrust
,
colonel
,
"
said
Charteris
,
as
he
quitted
the
room
,
closely
followed
by
a
couple
of
troopers
.
<EOS>
Ascending
the
great
staircase
,
he
proceeded
deliberately
along
a
corridor
,
until
he
came
to
a
particular
bed
-
chamber
,
where
he
stopped
,
saying
to
the
guard
,
as
he
went
in
,
"
I
wo
n't
detain
you
long
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
troopers
remained
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
did
not
come
forth
within
a
reasonable
time
,
they
entered
the
room
,
and
to
their
astonishment
and
dismay
found
it
empty
.
<EOS>
They
searched
about
—
in
the
closets
,
behind
the
curtains
,
under
the
bed
,
and
in
every
place
,
likely
and
unlikely
,
but
failed
to
find
him
—
nor
could
they
comprehend
how
he
had
got
off
,
since
there
appeared
to
be
no
other
exit
but
the
door
.
<EOS>
On
going
down
-
stairs
,
they
found
Colonel
Oxburgh
impatiently
awaiting
them
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
door
was
standing
wide
open
,
and
showed
the
troop
drawn
up
outside
,
and
ready
for
instant
departure
.
<EOS>
The
colonel
was
greatly
exasperated
when
he
learnt
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
"I
ought
to
have
known
better
,
"
he
mentally
ejaculated
,
"
than
to
trust
a
man
without
a
spark
of
honour
.
<EOS>
However
,
if
he
falls
into
my
hands
again
,
he
shall
not
escape
so
easily
.
<EOS>
"Though
<EOS>
despairing
of
success
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
would
not
leave
without
making
an
effort
to
recapture
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
On
careful
examination
of
the
bed
-
chamber
in
question
,
he
discovered
a
secret
door
,
connected
with
a
passage
leading
to
the
ruins
of
the
old
castle
,
where
no
doubt
the
fugitive
had
found
a
safe
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
evident
further
search
would
be
useless
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
departed
with
his
men
.
<EOS>
Little
did
he
think
as
he
rode
down
the
hill
that
Colonel
Charteris
was
watching
him
from
the
summit
of
the
keep
,
and
laughing
at
the
clever
manner
in
which
he
had
outwitted
his
visitor

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IVSir
Henry
Hoghton
and
the
QuakerAWARE
that
the
rebels
were
marching
towards
Lancaster
,
the
Whig
inhabitants
of
the
town
endeavoured
to
make
some
defensive
preparations
,
and
were
materially
aided
in
their
efforts
by
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
,
of
Hoghton
Tower
,
member
of
Parliament
for
Preston
,
and
Colonel
of
the
Lancashire
Militia
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
that
a
ship
called
the
Robert
,
of
five
hundred
tons
burthen
,
belonging
to
Mr.
Lawson
,
a
wealthy
Quaker
of
Lancaster
,
was
lying
at
Sunderland
—
a
small
sea
-
port
situated
at
the
estuary
of
the
Lune
—
Sir
Henry
went
to
Mr.
Lawson
to
endeavour
to
negotiate
with
him
for
the
use
of
the
guns
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
Mr.
Lawson
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
those
cannon
of
yours
will
enable
us
to
keep
the
rebels
out
of
the
town
,
I
am
sure
you
will
let
us
have
them
.
<EOS>
""Thou
shalt
have
them
on
one
condition
,
friend
,
"
replied
the
Quaker
.
"
<EOS>
And
on
one
condition
only
.
<EOS>
""Name
it
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Sir
Henry
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"Thou
shalt
give
me
a
bond
for
ten
thousand
pounds
to
insure
my
ship
,
the
Robert
,
against
any
damage
she
may
sustain
from
the
rebels
,
when
they
learn
I
have
parted
with
the
cannon
to
be
used
against
them
.
<EOS>
""Zounds
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Lawson
,
"
exclaimed
Sir
Henry
,
"
excuse
my
swearing
—
but
you
are
enough
to
provoke
a
saint
<EOS>
—
how
the
deuce
can
you
expect
me
to
agree
to
such
absurd
conditions
?
<EOS>
I
refuse
them
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
tell
you
as
a
magistrate
,
that
the
cargo
on
board
the
Robert
shall
at
once
be
seized
,
unless
you
consent
to
surrender
the
cannon
.
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
what
have
you
to
say
to
that?"After
a
moment
's
reflection
,
the
Quaker
replied
,
"
I
have
simply
to
say
,
friend
,
that
I
agree
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
observed
Sir
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
deserve
the
thanks
of
your
fellow
-
townsmen
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
recollect
,
friend
,
"
said
the
Quaker
,
"
that
the
cannon
will
be
of
no
use
to
thee
,
unless
thou
hast
sufficient
men
to
cover
the
town
.
<EOS>
Thou
hast
six
hundred
militiamen
at
Preston
.
<EOS>
Thou
must
bring
them
forthwith
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
There
is
also
,
unless
I
am
misinformed
,
a
regiment
of
dragoons
at
Preston
,
commanded
by
Colonel
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
useful
here
.
<EOS>
""Colonel
<EOS>
Stanhope
can
not
move
his
dragoons
without
an
order
from
General
Wills
,
"
said
Sir
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
militia
,
I
ca
n't
bring
them
here
because
I
should
deprive
Preston
of
its
main
defence
.
<EOS>
""That
is
unfortunate
,
"
observed
the
Quaker
.
<EOS>
"
The
best
fighting
men
in
Lancaster
are
Jacobites
,
and
likely
to
help
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
trust
them
to
serve
the
cannon
.
<EOS>
""I
begin
to
think
you
are
a
Jacobite
yourself
,
Mr.
Lawson
,
"
observed
Sir
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
Since
you
raise
all
these
difficulties
you
must
order
the
Robert
to
leave
Sunderland
,
and
move
to
some
other
port
.
<EOS>
""I
ca
n't
do
it
,
friend
,
"
observed
the
Quaker
.
<EOS>
"
The
rebels
would
consider
the
step
as
an
injustice
to
themselves
,
and
assuredly
resent
it
.
<EOS>
""This
<EOS>
truckling
to
the
rebels
proves
you
to
be
a
Jacobite
,
"
said
Sir
Henry
,
angrily
;
"
but
I
will
consult
my
brother
magistrates
,
Mr.
Rigby
and
Colonel
Charteris
,
and
if
they
are
of
my
opinion
,
we
will
issue
a
warrant
and
seize
the
arms
.
<EOS>
""Do
as
it
seems
good
to
thee
,
in
regard
to
the
cannon
,
friend
,
"
rejoined
the
Quaker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
counsel
thy
brother
magistrates
not
to
blow
up
the
bridge
,
as
I
hear
is
their
intention
.
<EOS>
They
will
not
thereby
hinder
the
entrance
of
the
rebels
,
since
the
river
is
passable
at
low
water
both
for
horse
and
foot
,
and
will
do
great
damage
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
""There
<EOS>
you
are
right
,
"
said
Sir
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
The
bridge
shall
not
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
further
complaints
to
<EOS>
make?""Yea
,
verily
,
"
replied
the
Quaker
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
complain
that
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
hath
been
improperly
and
imprudently
wasted
by
him
thou
callest
Colonel
Charteris
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
so
?
"
demanded
Sir
Henry
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
he
hath
caused
Samuel
Satterthwaite
to
cast
it
into
the
town-
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
<EOS>
he
thought
Sam
Satterthwaite
might
sell
it
to
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
""Wherefore
<EOS>
not
use
it
against
them
himself
?
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
of
peace
,
and
Colonel
Charteris
is
a
man
of
war
.
<EOS>
Yet
methinks
,
the
order
to
spoil
the
powder
would
have
come
more
aptly
from
me
,
than
from
him
.
<EOS>
Most
assuredly
,
however
,
I
would
have
given
no
such
direction
.
<EOS>
""I
can
easily
believe
it
,
Mr.
Lawson
,
"
replied
Sir
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
value
of
gunpowder
,
having
an
armed
vessel
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
""I
know
its
utility
at
this
moment
,
"
rejoined
the
Quaker
,
"
when
an
insurrection
has
to
be
quelled
.
<EOS>
""Or
aided
,
"
said
Sir
Henry
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
wo
n't
argue
with
you
further
,
Mr.
Lawson
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
due
notice
when
the
arms
are
seized
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
much
afraid
of
that
,
"
muttered
the
Quaker
,
as
Sir
Henry
took
his
departure
.

CHAPTER
VHow
the
Prisoners
in
Lancaster
Castle
<EOS>
were
releasedFAR
from
presenting
a
stern
and
threatening
aspect
to
the
rebels
,
the
old
town
of
Lancaster
seemed
to
smile
upon
them
as
they
approached
it
.
<EOS>
The
sun
shone
brightly
on
the
castle
hill
,
giving
a
cheerful
air
to
the
ancient
fortress
that
crowned
it
,
and
no
cannon
were
planted
at
its
walls
.
<EOS>
No
militia
,
no
dragoons
,
were
drawn
to
dispute
the
passage
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
a
great
number
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
collected
there
,
mingled
with
the
townsfolk
—
most
of
whom
were
in
their
holiday
attire
—
to
give
them
welcome
.
<EOS>
Headed
by
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
mounted
on
his
dapple
-
grey
steed
which
had
borne
him
well
throughout
the
whole
of
the
long
march
,
the
insurgents
came
joyously
on
,
and
were
received
with
shouts
by
the
concourse
assembled
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
—
the
ladies
waving
their
kerchiefs
enthusiastically
.
<EOS>
The
good
looks
and
chivalrous
appearance
of
the
earl
were
well
calculated
to
impress
the
female
portion
of
the
beholders
,
who
manifested
their
admiration
in
the
way
we
have
stated
.
<EOS>
Riding
with
his
sword
unsheathed
,
Lord
Derwentwater
occasionally
bowed
in
acknowledgment
of
the
attention
paid
him
.
<EOS>
Close
behind
him
rode
his
brother
,
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
Captain
Wogan
,
both
of
whom
were
thought
handsome
men
,
but
nothing
compared
with
the
earl
,
who
captivated
all
the
ladies
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Entirely
composed
of
gentlemen
of
good
family
,
almost
all
of
them
young
,
very
well
dressed
,
and
extremely
well
mounted
,
and
of
course
not
having
at
all
the
air
of
common
soldiers
,
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
's
regiment
caused
great
excitement
.
<EOS>
Flattered
by
their
reception
,
these
young
gentlemen
bowed
to
the
ladies
,
and
in
some
instances
persuaded
themselves
that
their
salutations
were
returned
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
might
have
been
so
,
since
it
is
certain
the
ladies
were
not
displeased
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
was
not
so
much
admired
,
and
the
ladies
declared
he
was
not
fit
to
have
the
command
of
such
an
army
;
but
they
praised
Lord
Widdrington
's
regiment
,
and
wondered
how
so
many
fine
young
men
could
have
been
got
together
.
<EOS>
The
Scottish
nobles
and
the
Lowland
corps
delighted
them
,
but
they
were
quite
astounded
by
the
Highlanders
,
with
whose
picturesque
garb
they
were
not
familiar
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
help
contrasting
these
fierce
-
looking
savages
,
as
they
styled
them
,
with
the
handsome
Englishmen
,
and
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
with
his
tall
,
stalwart
figure
and
grim
countenance
filled
them
with
terror
.
<EOS>
After
crossing
the
bridge
without
any
other
interruption
,
except
the
very
agreeable
one
described
,
the
insurgent
army
marched
to
the
market
-
place
,
followed
by
an
immense
concourse
.
<EOS>
Here
the
Highlanders
formed
themselves
in
a
body
round
the
cross
,
and
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
,
having
their
swords
bared
,
drew
up
around
them
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
with
the
English
and
Scottish
nobles
were
stationed
in
the
centre
of
the
throng
.
<EOS>
King
James
the
Third
was
then
proclaimed
amid
the
hearty
cheers
of
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
troops
moved
away
,
and
were
billeted
and
quartered
in
every
part
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
While
the
proclamation
was
being
made
,
Captain
Gordon
had
remarked
a
person
at
the
open
window
of
a
stationer
's
shop
,
kept
by
a
certain
Christopher
Hopkins
,
evidently
engaged
in
counting
the
numbers
of
the
insurgents
,
and
entering
the
particulars
with
great
care
in
a
small
memorandum
book
.
<EOS>
Suspecting
that
the
man
's
design
was
to
afford
information
to
the
Government
,
Captain
Gordon
went
to
the
shop
as
soon
as
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
,
and
then
found
that
the
individual
he
had
seen
preparing
the
report
was
Christopher
Hopkins
himself
.
<EOS>
Interrogated
by
Captain
Gordon
,
Hopkins
admitted
that
he
had
taken
down
the
numbers
of
the
insurgent
army
,
and
,
moreover
,
had
given
the
report
to
his
friend
Ralph
Fairbrother
,
who
was
about
to
take
it
to
General
Carpenter
at
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
As
Hopkins
refused
to
give
any
further
information
,
Captain
Gordon
ordered
his
immediate
arrest
,
and
directed
that
he
should
be
kept
in
strict
custody
till
Ralph
Fairbrother
was
found
.
<EOS>
Fairbrother
's
residence
was
discovered
,
but
he
had
already
set
out
on
his
errand
.
<EOS>
A
reward
of
thirty
pounds
was
offered
for
his
capture
,
but
proved
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
Amongst
those
who
witnessed
the
entrance
of
the
insurgent
army
into
the
town
were
the
prisoners
in
the
castle
,
who
had
contrived
to
get
upon
the
leads
of
the
building
,
and
saluted
their
deliverers
,
as
they
styled
them
,
with
loud
cheers
.
<EOS>
Several
of
these
unlucky
individuals
had
been
confined
for
political
offences
,
and
as
most
of
them
were
Jacobites
,
they
confidently
calculated
upon
liberation
.
<EOS>
Amongst
them
was
the
celebrated
Tom
Syddall
,
a
blacksmith
of
Manchester
,
who
had
headed
the
mob
at
the
time
of
the
Sacheverel
riots
,
and
assisted
in
pulling
down
the
Presbyterian
meeting
-
houses
in
that
town
.
<EOS>
For
these
offences
the
"
Mob
Captain
,
"
as
he
was
styled
,
was
placed
in
the
pillory
,
and
imprisoned
in
Lancaster
Castle
.
<EOS>
Tom
Syddall
,
we
may
mention
,
had
a
son
quite
as
ardent
a
Jacobite
as
himself
,
whose
exploits
during
the
rebellion
of
1745
have
been
recounted
in
another
work
.
<EOS>
A
consultation
was
held
by
General
Forster
with
Lord
Derwentwater
and
the
other
leaders
as
to
the
propriety
of
releasing
the
debtors
as
well
as
the
Crown
prisoners
in
the
castle
,
when
it
was
decided
that
the
former
only
should
be
set
free
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
who
by
this
time
had
returned
from
his
unsuccessful
visit
to
Hornby
Castle
,
was
directed
to
order
their
immediate
discharge
,
and
for
this
purpose
went
up
to
the
castle
,
without
a
guard
and
only
accompanied
by
Mr.
Patten
,
the
chaplain
of
the
force
.
<EOS>
On
entering
by
the
portal
of
the
Gateway
Tower
,
above
which
was
an
effigy
of
John
of
Gaunt
,
they
were
respectfully
received
by
an
officer
,
to
whom
Colonel
Oxburgh
gave
General
Forster
's
order
for
the
liberation
of
the
Crown
prisoners
,
and
while
the
colonel
and
the
chaplain
walked
on
into
the
spacious
castle
-
yard
,
the
order
was
taken
to
the
governor
.
<EOS>
Ere
many
minutes
had
elapsed
,
loud
shouts
,
that
made
the
old
towers
ring
,
announced
that
the
order
had
been
complied
with
,
and
soon
afterwards
some
thirty
individuals
,
most
of
them
very
shabbily
attired
,
rushed
tumultuously
into
the
court
,
and
gathering
round
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
shouted
"
Long
live
King
James
<EOS>
the
Third!"Foremost
among
them
was
a
short
,
strongly
built
man
,
with
a
plain
,
honest
countenance
,
marked
by
a
bold
determined
expression
,
who
looked
like
what
he
had
been
—
a
blacksmith
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
not
Tom
Syddall
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
The
man
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
whereupon
the
colonel
shook
hands
with
him
,
as
did
the
chaplain
,
and
both
expressed
their
satisfaction
at
being
instrumental
in
setting
him
and
his
fellow
-
prisoners
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
all
been
imprisoned
for
your
attachment
to
your
rightful
sovereign
,
"
said
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
"
and
it
is
our
duty
to
liberate
you
.
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
Syddall
,
"
he
added
,
"
I
know
you
to
be
a
brave
fellow
,
and
I
expect
you
will
join
us
.
<EOS>
""Such
<EOS>
is
my
design
,
colonel
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
more
,
I
can
bring
all
these
my
friends
with
me
.
<EOS>
Have
I
said
too
much
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
appealing
to
them
.
<EOS>
"No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
"
they
responded
unanimously
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
all
join
.
<EOS>
""I
am
right
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
friends
will
form
a
small
troop
,
Syddall
,
and
I
make
no
doubt
General
Forster
will
give
you
the
command
of
it
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
being
now
arranged
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
the
chaplain
quitted
the
castle
,
and
proceeded
to
the
general
's
quarters
,
followed
by
the
newly
-
liberated
prisoners
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
was
very
much
pleased
by
this
accession
of
force
,
and
confirmed
Colonel
Oxburgh
's
promise
by
appointing
Syddall
captain
of
the
little
troop
.
<EOS>
That
night
,
Brigadier
Mackintosh
sent
a
party
of
Highlanders
to
search
for
arms
at
every
house
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
took
with
them
Mr.
Parkinson
,
the
mayor
,
a
staunch
supporter
of
the
Government
,
and
compelled
him
to
assist
in
the
search
.
<EOS>
Their
orders
were
to
plunder
the
houses
of
all
such
persons
as
refused
compliance
with
their
commands
.
<EOS>
While
the
search
for
arms
was
still
going
on
,
Captain
Wogan
came
to
Forster
's
quarters
,
and
said:"General
,
I
have
just
received
information
of
six
pieces
of
cannon
on
board
the
ship
Robert
,
now
lying
at
Sunderland
,
five
miles
from
this
town
,
and
propose
,
with
your
sanction
,
to
take
a
detachment
with
me
to
-
morrow
morning
and
seize
them
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
so
,
by
all
means
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Henry
Hoghton
intended
to
seize
these
ship
guns
,
and
bring
them
here
for
the
defence
of
the
town
,
"
continued
Captain
Wogan
,
"
and
for
that
purpose
had
taken
off
the
wheels
of
some
of
his
carriages
.
<EOS>
But
his
design
being
frustrated
by
our
approach
,
I
have
got
possession
of
the
carriage
-
wheels
,
and
mean
to
use
them
as
he
intended
for
the
cannon
.
""Capital
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Forster
,
laughing
heartily
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
something
must
be
done
to
remunerate
Mr.
Lawson
,
the
owner
of
the
ship
,
general
,
"
said
Wogan
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
make
his
claim
,
and
we
will
give
him
our
note
for
the
amount
to
be
made
payable
when
our
master
's
concerns
are
settled
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
Taking
a
strong
detachment
with
him
,
Captain
Wogan
went
,
next
morning
,
to
Sunderland
,
where
he
found
the
Robert
,
and
demanded
the
cannon
in
the
name
of
King
James
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Lawson
was
on
board
at
the
time
,
and
at
once
surrendered
the
guns
receiving
a
note
of
hand
for
six
hundred
pounds
,
as
suggested
by
General
Forster
,
with
which
he
appeared
perfectly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
how
wilt
thou
get
the
guns
to
Lancaster
,
friend
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
.
<EOS>
"Very
easily
,
"
replied
Captain
Wogan
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
with
me
the
wheels
of
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
three
carriages
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
hast
done
well
,
"
observed
the
Quaker
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
That
insolent
baronet
has
been
rightly
served
.
<EOS>
""I
begin
to
think
you
have
a
friendly
feeling
towards
our
party
,
Mr.
Lawson
,
"
observed
Captain
Wogan
.
<EOS>
"I
am
of
no
party
,
friend
,
"
replied
the
cautious
Quaker
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
tell
thee
one
thing
—
thou
hast
got
the
cannon
far
cheaper
than
I
would
have
sold
them
to
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
<EOS>
VILancashire
WitchesNEVER
had
Lancaster
been
so
gay
as
during
its
occupation
by
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
showing
themselves
hostile
,
as
had
been
apprehended
,
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
proved
exceedingly
friendly
.
<EOS>
At
many
houses
where
the
young
insurgents
were
quartered
,
they
were
treated
like
guests
.
<EOS>
Tea
parties
were
given
to
which
they
were
invited
,
and
they
were
thus
enabled
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
female
members
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
As
these
young
troopers
could
not
be
distinguished
either
in
manner
or
attire
from
their
officers
,
they
were
frequently
questioned
as
to
their
actual
military
rank
,
and
gave
something
like
the
following
explanation
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
our
regiment
there
are
no
common
men
.
<EOS>
We
serve
as
gentlemen
,
and
are
treated
like
gentlemen
by
our
officers
.
<EOS>
But
though
we
consider
ourselves
quite
equal
to
our
leaders
,
we
unhesitatingly
obey
them
.
<EOS>
By
us
the
word
of
command
is
never
disputed
.
<EOS>
Though
most
of
us
have
grooms
,
each
of
us
attends
to
his
own
horse
,
and
you
see
how
well
the
horses
look
,
in
spite
of
our
long
march
.
<EOS>
We
are
never
out
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
We
take
the
rough
and
the
smooth
,
as
they
come
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
we
have
had
plenty
of
rough
work
,
and
very
little
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
The
'
smooth
'
has
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
The
kindness
and
courtesy
of
the
gentlemen
of
Lancaster
,
and
the
attentions
shown
us
by
the
ladies
,
make
ample
amends
for
previous
hardships
.
<EOS>
"Such
was
the
account
of
themselves
given
by
the
handsome
young
troopers
,
and
listened
to
with
the
greatest
interest
by
the
ladies
,
who
thought
that
a
regiment
composed
entirely
of
gentlemen
must
be
victorious
either
in
love
or
war
.
<EOS>
It
happened
,
singularly
enough
,
at
the
time
of
the
Jacobite
expedition
,
that
Lancaster
and
Preston
abounded
in
pretty
girls
.
<EOS>
Always
famed
for
the
beauty
and
fascinations
of
the
fair
sex
—
who
have
been
designated
the
"
Lancashire
witches
"
—
the
whole
county
was
remarkably
rich
in
feminine
attraction
at
that
particular
juncture
.
<EOS>
Of
the
Preston
belles
we
shall
speak
hereafter
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
the
beauties
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
If
we
said
there
were
a
hundred
really
handsome
young
women
in
Lancaster
at
the
time
of
which
we
speak
,
we
should
be
under
the
mark
.
<EOS>
We
believe
there
were
double
the
number
,
and
they
were
all
as
gay
and
good
-
humoured
as
they
were
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Since
we
can
not
describe
them
all
,
we
shall
select
three
of
the
most
attractive
—
namely
,
Dryope
Dutton
,
Nicola
Glasson
,
and
Aurelia
Heysham
.
<EOS>
Had
they
not
been
nearly
of
an
age
,
these
three
lovely
girls
might
have
been
taken
for
sisters
,
so
much
were
they
alike
.
<EOS>
Each
was
between
nineteen
and
twenty
—
each
had
delicately
-
formed
features
,
blonde
tresses
,
and
blue
eyes
,
capable
of
the
tenderest
expression
—
and
each
was
tall
and
graceful
.
<EOS>
All
three
knew
how
to
set
off
their
charms
to
advantage
by
dress
.
<EOS>
Dryope
Dutton
,
however
,
was
considered
the
prettiest
girl
in
Lancaster
,
and
had
the
greatest
number
of
admirers
,
all
of
whom
were
sent
about
their
business
on
the
arrival
of
the
rebel
army
,
their
places
being
immediately
filled
by
gallant
young
insurgents
.
<EOS>
None
of
her
new
suitors
were
discouraged
by
Dryope
,
but
she
appeared
to
have
a
decided
preference
for
Captain
Shaftoe
.
<EOS>
Following
Dryope
's
example
,
Nicola
and
Aurelia
,
dismissed
their
lovers
,
and
laid
themselves
out
to
captivate
the
new
-
comers
,
in
which
design
they
were
eminently
successful
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
pretty
girls
did
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
None
of
them
would
now
be
seen
without
a
Jacobite
admirer
.
<EOS>
During
their
stay
at
Lancaster
nothing
was
thought
of
but
flirting
by
the
amorous
youths
,
who
were
completely
enthralled
by
their
lady
-
loves
,
and
had
these
syrens
desired
to
turn
them
from
their
cause
,
we
fear
they
might
have
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
all
the
girls
professed
themselves
ardent
Jacobites
,
and
if
they
fancied
their
lovers
were
lukewarm
,
strenuously
urged
them
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
intimated
,
the
town
now
presented
a
very
lively
appearance
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
the
terrace
near
the
castle
thronged
with
handsome
young
troopers
and
charming
girls
;
but
when
the
promenade
was
over
,
the
company
wandered
about
the
streets
,
visiting
the
market
-
place
,
the
town
-
hall
,
the
custom
-
house
,
the
quays
and
the
bridge
,
and
strolling
on
the
banks
of
the
Lune
.
<EOS>
On
Sunday
,
Saint
Mary
's
Church
was
crowded
by
the
same
young
ladies
,
who
expressed
a
great
desire
to
hear
the
Reverend
Mr.
Paul
,
who
had
recently
joined
the
expedition
,
read
prayers
,
and
Mr.
Patten
preach
;
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
they
were
not
still
more
anxious
to
meet
their
admirers
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
when
the
service
was
over
,
the
ladies
congregated
in
the
churchyard
,
and
each
fair
girl
was
escorted
home
by
the
trooper
she
preferred
.
<EOS>
Whether
all
this
flirting
was
approved
of
by
the
mammas
of
the
young
ladies
in
question
we
will
not
pretend
to
say
.
<EOS>
No
effort
was
made
to
check
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
the
officers
of
the
regiments
to
which
the
young
men
belonged
interfere
—
<EOS>
well
knowing
interference
would
be
useless
—
so
it
went
on
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
day
of
parting
came
,
and
a
very
sad
day
it
was
both
for
the
enamoured
young
troopers
and
their
lady
-
loves
.
<EOS>
How
many
tears
were
shed
!
<EOS>
how
many
tender
adieux
taken
!
<EOS>
how
many
protestations
made
of
undying
affection!"We
shall
never
see
you
again
!
"
cried
the
heartbroken
girls
.
<EOS>
"
Military
men
are
always
inconstant
.
<EOS>
You
will
forget
us
as
soon
as
you
arrive
at
Preston
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
young
troopers
vowed
they
were
an
exception
to
the
rule
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
no
doubts
as
to
our
constancy
!
<EOS>
"
they
cried
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
always
remain
faithful
.
<EOS>
Preston
may
be
full
of
pretty
girls
—
as
they
say
it
is
—
but
they
will
have
no
attraction
for
us
.
<EOS>
""Don't
<EOS>
be
surprised
if
we
come
to
look
after
you
,
"
said
Dryope
,
to
Captain
Shaftoe
;
"
and
if
we
find
you
false
and
forsworn?""How
<EOS>
can
you
suppose
I
could
be
false
to
you
,
sweetest
Dryope
?
"
said
Shaftoe
;
stopping
her
mouth
with
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
"
Think
it
not
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
you
wo
n't
come
to
Preston
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
I
will
—
<EOS>
if
I
can
—
that
I
promise
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
I
will
only
bid
you
adieu
for
a
short
time
,
"
he
said
,
kissing
her
once
more
as
he
sprang
to
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
Many
more
partings
,
equally
tender
,
took
place
.
<EOS>
Many
a
bright
eye
was
dimmed
,
as
the
regiments
to
which
the
handsome
troopers
belonged
quitted
Lancaster
,
and
took
the
road
to
Preston
.
<EOS>
Full
of
sadness
were
the
young
men
as
they
looked
back
at
the
fair
creatures
they
were
leaving
;
and
had
they
been
told
at
the
moment
that
they
would
soon
forget
them
they
would
have
resented
the
imputation
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
how
they
behaved
at
Preston
.
<EOS>
In
quitting
Lancaster
,
where
he
was
so
well
received
,
and
where
he
was
constantly
receiving
slight
accessions
to
his
force
,
General
Forster
committed
a
grave
error
.
<EOS>
At
Lancaster
he
had
a
strong
castle
which
might
have
been
garrisoned
and
provisioned
,
and
could
certainly
have
been
held
till
assistance
arrived
from
Scotland
;
while
not
far
from
the
town
was
a
seaport
whence
succours
could
be
obtained
from
France
.
<EOS>
These
advantages
were
pointed
out
to
him
by
Lord
Derwentwater
,
but
he
replied
that
his
object
in
marching
to
Preston
was
to
secure
Warrington
Bridge
before
the
enemy
could
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
The
possession
of
this
bridge
,
he
thought
,
would
give
him
both
Manchester
and
Liverpool
,
and
these
important
towns
gained
,
the
whole
surrounding
country
would
flock
to
his
standard
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Lord
Derwentwater
showed
him
the
difficulties
he
would
have
to
encounter
,
and
explained
that
the
inhabitants
of
Liverpool
were
decidedly
adverse
to
the
Jacobite
cause
.
<EOS>
A
totally
different
view
was
taken
by
Lord
Widdrington
,
who
assured
the
general
he
might
depend
upon
receiving
the
support
of
the
High
Church
Tories
of
Manchester
,
and
Mr.
Charles
Beswicke
,
who
had
just
arrived
from
that
town
,
confirmed
the
idea
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
,
therefore
,
resolved
to
go
on
,
despite
Lord
Derwentwater
's
opposition
.
<EOS>
Several
important
additions
,
as
we
have
just
stated
,
had
been
made
to
the
rebel
force
.
<EOS>
Amongst
these
were
five
gentlemen
belonging
to
some
of
the
oldest
and
most
distinguished
families
in
the
county
,
whose
adhesion
could
not
fail
to
be
serviceable
to
the
cause
.
<EOS>
They
were
Albert
Hodgson
of
Leighton
Hall
,
John
Dalton
of
Thurnham
Hall
,
Edward
Tyldesley
of
the
Lodge
,
Henry
Butler
of
Rawcliffe
,
and
Thomas
Walton
of
Walton
Hall
.
<EOS>
They
all
brought
retainers
with
them
,
and
each
was
made
a
captain
.
<EOS>
Charles
Beswicke
,
previously
mentioned
,
who
likewise
joined
at
Lancaster
,
was
son
of
the
Reverend
Charles
Beswicke
,
rector
of
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
A
dull
and
gloomy
morning
harmonised
with
the
feelings
of
the
insurgents
as
they
quitted
Lancaster
,
but
as
they
advanced
on
their
march
the
day
improved
,
and
by
the
time
they
reached
Garstang
it
had
become
quite
fine
.
<EOS>
Here
the
infantry
proposed
to
halt
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
They
brought
with
them
the
six
pieces
of
cannon
seized
on
board
the
Robert
,
and
likewise
some
casks
of
brandy
taken
from
the
custom
-
house
.
<EOS>
At
Garstang
,
Brigadier
Mackintosh
set
free
Christopher
Hopkins
,
who
had
been
hitherto
detained
a
prisoner
,
telling
him
if
he
again
fell
into
his
hands
,
he
would
shoot
him
.
<EOS>
Long
before
the
cavalry
reached
Preston
they
came
in
sight
of
the
town
,
delightfully
situated
on
a
ridge
overlooking
the
flat
district
they
were
traversing
,
and
the
aspect
of
the
town
was
so
cheerful
,
that
the
spirits
of
the
young
troopers
began
to
revive
.
<EOS>
They
had
heard
much
of
the
beauty
of
the
ladies
,
and
curiosity
to
behold
them
was
suddenly
awakened
in
their
breasts
.
<EOS>
Could
they
compare
with
the
lovely
girls
they
had
left
behind
?
<EOS>
That
was
a
question
which
would
very
soon
be
answered
.
<EOS>
The
young
troopers
now
became
impatient
to
get
to
Preston
,
and
wondered
whether
the
ladies
would
come
forth
to
meet
them
as
had
been
the
case
at
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
In
this
respect
they
were
disappointed
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
ladies
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
—
none
on
Friargate
brow
—
but
in
the
market
-
place
an
agreeable
surprise
awaited
them
.

THE

IProud
PrestonPROUD
Preston
—
or
Priests
'
Town
,
as
it
was
originally
called
from
the
number
of
its
religious
houses
—
merited
the
epithet
applied
to
it
,
albeit
somewhat
derisively
.
<EOS>
Proud
were
its
inhabitants
—
proud
of
their
town
—
of
its
fine
situation
,
its
beauty
,
its
salubrity
—
proud
of
their
wives
and
daughters
,
whom
they
deemed
,
and
not
erroneously
,
the
handsomest
women
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
As
a
place
of
fashionable
resort
,
where
the
best
society
could
be
found
,
Preston
,
at
the
period
of
our
story
,
ranked
higher
than
any
other
town
in
the
North
of
England
.
<EOS>
A
great
number
of
gentry
resided
there
—
many
of
them
belonging
to
the
oldest
Catholic
families
of
the
county
,
and
these
persons
gave
an
aristocratic
character
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
But
the
Preston
gentry
were
not
as
wealthy
as
they
were
proud
.
<EOS>
High
Churchmen
as
well
as
<EOS>
Roman
Catholics
abounded
in
the
town
,
and
the
only
thing
low
about
the
parish
church
was
the
steeple
.
<EOS>
Hence
the
old
rhyme
:
Proud
Preston
,
poor
people
,
High
church
,
and
low
steeple!Delightfully
situated
on
the
summit
of
a
ridge
,
rising
gradually
from
the
Ribble
,
which
sweeps
round
it
on
the
south
,
and
commanding
extensive
and
beautiful
views
in
every
direction
,
Preston
,
from
its
salubrious
climate
,
and
contiguity
to
the
sea
,
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
most
agreeable
and
healthy
towns
in
England
.
<EOS>
In
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
Preston
was
but
a
small
place
,
and
could
boast
little
regularity
of
construction
,
but
it
had
a
remarkably
clean
and
cheerful
aspect
.
<EOS>
Attached
to
many
of
the
houses
were
good
gardens
,
and
these
being
laid
out
on
the
slopes
of
the
eminence
on
which
the
town
was
reared
,
contributed
materially
to
its
beauty
.
<EOS>
The
best
houses
were
in
Church
-
street
and
Fishergate
,
running
from
east
to
west
on
the
south
side
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
A
few
of
the
habitations
were
old
,
but
the
greater
part
were
modern
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
latter
were
two
large
mansions
,
standing
nearly
opposite
each
other
in
Church
-
street
,
and
belonging
respectively
to
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
and
Mr.
Eyre
.
<EOS>
Both
these
mansions
possessed
large
gardens
and
good
stables
,
and
are
specially
referred
to
because
we
shall
have
to
speak
of
them
hereafter
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
also
some
good
old
houses
in
Friargate
,
which
led
from
the
Lancaster
road
on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
to
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
In
the
market
-
place
,
which
formed
a
large
square
,
with
an
obelisk
in
the
midst
instead
of
a
cross
,
there
were
several
good
old
houses
;
and
here
,
also
,
was
the
town
-
hall
,
an
extremely
picturesque
old
edifice
,
four
stories
high
,
and
each
story
projecting
above
the
other
,
painted
black
and
white
,
and
having
great
gables
and
large
windows
.
<EOS>
At
the
corner
of
one
of
the
streets
communicating
with
the
market
-
place
stood
the
Mitre
,
the
principal
hostel
of
the
town
,
and
noted
for
its
good
cheer
and
good
wines
.
<EOS>
Not
far
off
was
the
White
Bull
,
another
good
inn
,
much
frequented
by
the
townsfolk
.
<EOS>
The
parish
church
,
dedicated
in
the
first
instance
to
Saint
Wilfrid
,
but
more
recently
to
Saint
John
,
stood
on
the
south
side
of
Church
-
street
.
<EOS>
A
fine
old
structure
,
it
had
undergone
repairs
,
not
altogether
judicious
,
and
was
disfigured
by
a
low
tower
.
<EOS>
A
large
churchyard
separated
it
from
the
street
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
Reverend
Samuel
Peploe
,
a
staunch
supporter
of
the
reigning
family
,
and
greatly
opposed
to
the
Jacobites
,
was
vicar
of
Preston
.
<EOS>
On
Fishergate
brow
stood
a
small
Roman
Catholic
chapel
,
dedicated
to
Saint
Mary
.
<EOS>
At
the
Grey
Friars
was
the
old
prison
;
but
a
house
of
correction
had
been
recently
erected
in
the
fields
on
the
west
side
of
the
town
—
rather
a
large
building
for
so
small
a
place
.
<EOS>
From
the
eastern
extremity
of
Church
-
street
,
a
road
leading
to
Wigan
descended
the
hill
,
and
after
passing
through
some
pleasant
fields
bordered
by
high
hedges
,
crossed
the
old
bridge
over
the
Ribble
near
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
.
<EOS>
Such
was
Preston
when
garrisoned
by
the
insurgent
forces
.
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
the
vicar
,
to
whom
we
have
just
alluded
,
all
their
enemies
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Stanhope
had
gone
with
his
regiment
of
dragoons
to
join
General
Wills
at
Warrington
;
and
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
had
abandoned
his
large
mansion
,
and
taken
the
militia
to
Wigan
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
,
therefore
,
to
prevent
the
inhabitants
from
giving
them
a
hearty
welcome
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
municipal
authorities
,
from
prudential
reasons
,
declined
to
act
,
the
office
of
receiving
them
devolved
on
private
individuals
.
<EOS>
As
General
Forster
and
the
other
leaders
rode
into
the
market
-
place
,
they
were
met
by
a
large
party
of
gentlemen
,
who
welcomed
them
to
the
town
,
and
professed
their
desire
to
show
them
every
hospitality
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
,
the
noble
lords
,
and
all
the
officers
were
invited
to
dine
that
day
at
the
town
-
hall
,
and
it
was
likewise
intimated
to
the
general
that
a
grand
dinner
,
to
be
followed
by
a
ball
,
would
be
given
at
the
same
place
on
the
following
day
,
by
which
time
it
was
expected
the
infantry
and
Highlanders
would
have
arrived
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
quarters
,
Mr.
Eyre
's
large
house
in
Church
-
street
was
assigned
to
General
Forster
and
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
mansion
was
offered
to
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
Good
quarters
,
it
appeared
,
had
likewise
been
provided
for
all
the
officers
.
<EOS>
Greatly
pleased
by
their
reception
,
the
rebel
leaders
repaired
to
their
quarters
,
with
which
they
were
well
satisfied
.
<EOS>
In
the
mansion
assigned
to
them
,
General
Forster
and
Lord
Widdrington
found
everything
they
could
desire
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
house
at
all
inferior
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
presented
a
far
handsomer
appearance
from
the
street
,
as
it
occupied
a
more
elevated
position
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
internal
accommodation
belie
the
exterior
.
<EOS>
The
house
possessed
a
spacious
entrance
hall
,
and
several
commodious
and
well
furnished
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
.
<EOS>
Attached
to
it
were
excellent
stables
,
and
at
the
back
there
was
a
large
garden
.
<EOS>
Sir
Henry
had
taken
his
grooms
and
coachman
with
him
,
but
part
of
the
establishment
was
left
behind
.
<EOS>
After
settling
themselves
comfortably
in
their
new
quarters
,
the
rebel
leaders
proceeded
to
the
town
-
hall
,
where
a
sumptuous
dinner
awaited
them
,
and
so
well
pleased
was
General
Forster
with
the
entertainment
,
with
the
attentions
paid
him
,
and
with
his
quarters
,
that
he
resolved
to
stay
as
long
as
he
could
at
Preston
.
<EOS>
At
the
very
time
when
the
rebels
were
taking
possession
of
the
town
,
the
vicar
,
of
whose
attachment
to
the
House
of
Brunswick
we
have
spoken
,
happened
to
be
engaged
on
his
duties
in
the
church
,
and
he
seized
the
opportunity
of
reading
prayers
for
King
George
and
the
royal
family
.
<EOS>
For
this
display
of
zeal
and
courage
,
he
was
made
Warden
of
Manchester
,
and
subsequently
Bishop
of
Chester
.
<EOS>
No
molestation
or
interruption
were
offered
by
the
rebels
,
but
when
the
Reverend
Mr.
Paul
,
the
new
chaplain
of
the
regiment
,
heard
of
the
circumstance
,
he
begged
General
Forster
to
order
the
troops
to
attend
prayers
at
the
church
forthwith
.
<EOS>
Within
half
an
hour
after
Mr.
Peploe
had
quitted
it
,
the
church
was
entirely
filled
by
the
rebel
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wogan
,
Captain
Shaftoe
,
and
most
of
the
officers
were
present
.
<EOS>
While
the
bell
was
ringing
to
summon
this
second
congregation
,
Mr.
Paul
took
the
prayer
-
book
,
just
used
by
the
vicar
,
and
erased
the
name
of
King
George
,
substituting
for
it
the
name
of
King
James
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
prayer
for
the
royal
family
,
he
scratched
out
the
name
of
the
Princess
Sophia
,
and
introduced
that
of
Queen
Mary
of
Modena
.
<EOS>
Habited
in
a
blue
coat
,
wearing
a
long
wig
,
and
having
a
sword
by
his
side
,
this
stout
church
militant
proceeded
to
the
reading
-
desk
,
and
in
tones
quite
as
fervent
as
those
of
the
vicar
prayed
for
the
Pretender
and
his
mother
.
<EOS>
Had
James
the
Third
come
to
the
throne
,
no
doubt
Mr.
Paul
would
have
been
rewarded
with
a
bishopric
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
young
gentlemen
troopers
found
capital
quarters
in
the
Fishergate
and
Friargate
,
and
as
a
great
number
of
tea
-
parties
were
given
that
evening
,
to
which
they
were
bidden
,
they
had
an
opportunity
of
comparing
the
belles
of
Preston
with
those
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Till
then
they
had
believed
it
impossible
that
lovelier
girls
could
be
found
than
those
they
had
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
Now
they
confessed
their
mistake
.
<EOS>
That
morning
the
inconstant
youths
tore
themselves
away
distractedly
from
their
Lancaster
loves
,
but
at
night
an
entire
change
had
taken
place
in
their
sentiments
,
and
they
retired
to
rest
deeply
enamoured
of
the
Preston
girls
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIHow
King
James
was
proclaimed
for
the
last
TimeNEXT
morning
,
the
town
,
never
dull
,
presented
a
gayer
appearance
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
the
weather
was
propitious
,
and
enabled
the
ladies
to
come
forth
and
see
the
troops
paraded
.
<EOS>
After
this
pretty
sight
,
they
proceeded
to
the
Lancaster
road
to
witness
the
entrance
of
the
Highlanders
,
whom
they
were
very
curious
to
see
.
<EOS>
They
laughed
a
great
deal
at
the
strange
dresses
of
the
men
,
and
stopped
their
ears
to
shut
out
the
shrill
sound
of
the
bagpipes
;
but
,
on
the
whole
,
they
were
pleased
.
<EOS>
As
was
the
case
wherever
he
went
,
Brigadier
Mackintosh
produced
a
strong
effect
upon
the
beholders
.
<EOS>
His
tall
martial
figure
riveted
their
regards
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
the
rigid
muscles
of
the
grim
old
warrior
's
countenance
were
somewhat
relaxed
,
and
he
even
attempted
to
smile
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
he
was
gratified
by
the
undisguised
admiration
of
the
Preston
beauties
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
fair
spectators
were
best
pleased
by
a
party
of
young
recruits
who
followed
the
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
Raw
soldiers
they
might
be
,
but
they
were
very
pretty
fellows
,
and
had
plenty
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
Number
,
three
dozen
—
not
including
captain
.
<EOS>
Height
,
rather
below
the
average
—
features
delicate
and
feminine
—
figures
slight
,
but
remarkably
well
formed
.
<EOS>
Never
did
scarlet
coats
,
laced
cocked
-
hats
,
flaxen
wigs
,
and
all
the
rest
of
their
accoutrements
find
more
graceful
wearers
.
<EOS>
Red
and
white
cockades
showed
they
were
English
recruits
—
the
Scots
being
distinguished
by
cockades
of
blue
and
white
.
<EOS>
All
carried
muskets
,
except
the
captain
,
who
alone
had
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
been
chosen
on
account
of
his
good
looks
.
<EOS>
Certainly
he
was
the
handsomest
,
as
well
as
the
tallest
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
The
whole
troop
presented
a
very
animated
appearance
,
and
none
of
them
looked
fatigued
by
the
march
.
<EOS>
Highly
diverted
by
the
notice
they
excited
,
they
ogled
the
ladies
very
freely
,
and
occasionally
paid
them
a
passing
compliment
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
knowing
what
to
think
of
these
singular
recruits
,
a
crowd
of
young
damsels
followed
them
,
laughing
and
jesting
with
them
as
they
marched
along
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
market
-
place
,
where
the
troops
were
assembling
to
proclaim
King
James
,
the
recruits
created
quite
a
sensation
—
especially
among
certain
young
gentlemen
in
Lord
Derwentwater
's
regiment
,
who
stared
at
them
in
astonishment
,
and
could
scarcely
believe
their
eyes
.
<EOS>
Their
perplexity
afforded
the
recruits
great
amusement
,
but
they
pretended
not
to
recognise
them
,
and
did
not
return
their
signs
and
gestures
.
<EOS>
Equally
astonished
was
Captain
Shaftoe
when
he
beheld
the
troop
;
but
quickly
recovering
himself
,
he
rode
up
to
General
Forster
and
obtained
his
permission
to
place
the
recruits
near
the
cross
.
<EOS>
For
this
service
he
received
the
thanks
of
the
handsome
young
captain
,
but
he
did
not
tarry
to
talk
to
him
then
,
or
ask
for
any
explanation
,
for
the
Highlanders
were
gathering
around
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
better
than
the
position
thus
gained
by
the
recruits
,
for
they
were
close
to
General
Forster
and
the
English
and
Scottish
nobles
,
and
could
see
everything
.
<EOS>
What
is
more
,
they
themselves
could
be
seen
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
they
were
conspicuous
objects
in
the
picture
,
and
really
contributed
to
its
effect
.
<EOS>
Stationed
elsewhere
,
they
would
have
been
lost
,
for
the
place
was
entirely
filled
with
the
military
and
the
townsfolk
.
<EOS>
When
the
proclamation
was
made
such
a
shout
arose
as
had
never
been
heard
in
that
place
before
.
<EOS>
Kerchiefs
were
waved
from
the
windows
of
the
town
-
hall
,
which
were
garnished
with
fair
dames
,
and
a
host
of
gentlemen
ranged
in
front
of
the
building
,
made
their
voices
heard
above
the
general
din
.
<EOS>
The
enthusiasm
pervaded
all
classes
,
and
a
more
exciting
scene
can
not
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
last
time
that
such
shouts
were
heard
in
England
.
<EOS>
Never
again
was
King
James
proclaimed
by
the
insurgent
forces
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIIThe
Countess
and
Dorothy
arrive
at
PrestonGENERAL
FORSTER
'S
utter
incapacity
as
a
leader
had
now
become
manifest
to
all
.
<EOS>
He
drank
as
hard
during
the
march
,
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
at
Bamborough
,
and
after
these
potations
his
head
could
not
be
very
clear
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
who
acted
for
him
,
many
ruinous
mistakes
must
have
occurred
.
<EOS>
Remonstrances
,
however
,
were
useless
.
<EOS>
To
argue
with
him
only
made
him
more
determinately
obstinate
.
<EOS>
Right
or
wrong
,
he
would
have
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
The
only
person
he
would
listen
to
was
Lord
Widdrington
,
who
knew
how
to
humour
him
.
<EOS>
This
state
of
things
at
head
-
quarters
filled
Lord
Derwentwater
with
the
gravest
apprehension
,
for
he
foresaw
that
the
general
's
blundering
and
obstinacy
must
expose
them
to
a
chance
of
defeat
,
whenever
an
engagement
with
the
enemy
should
occur
.
<EOS>
But
Forster
's
indifference
to
the
danger
of
his
position
was
quite
as
remarkable
as
his
stupidity
.
<EOS>
Although
informed
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
Preston
,
that
General
Wills
was
marching
to
Wigan
with
several
regiments
of
dragoons
,
and
some
regiments
of
foot
,
he
refused
to
believe
the
intelligence
,
and
took
no
pains
to
verify
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
he
seem
willing
to
credit
the
report
that
General
Carpenter
was
marching
against
him
from
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
So
delighted
was
he
with
Preston
,
with
his
quarters
,
with
the
hospitality
of
the
inhabitants
,
and
the
general
attractions
of
the
place
,
that
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
leave
.
<EOS>
Like
the
gentlemen
troopers
he
had
submitted
to
feminine
fascination
,
and
short
as
had
been
his
stay
,
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
a
charming
young
widow
,
already
held
him
in
thrall
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
indeed
,
to
be
the
design
of
the
Preston
belles
to
captivate
all
the
insurgent
leaders
,
and
many
a
tender
glance
was
thrown
at
Lord
Derwentwater
by
some
of
the
fairest
ladies
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
proof
against
all
their
allurements
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
the
proclamation
had
taken
place
,
when
the
crowd
dispersed
,
and
the
soldiers
had
returned
to
their
quarters
,
two
ladies
,
both
young
,
and
very
handsome
,
well
mounted
,
habited
in
elegant
riding
-
dresses
,
attended
by
an
elderly
personage
,
who
almost
looked
like
a
priest
,
and
followed
by
a
middle-
aged
man
-
servant
and
a
couple
of
grooms
,
each
having
a
valise
fastened
to
the
saddle
,
entered
Preston
by
the
avenue
connected
with
the
Lancaster
road
,
and
proceeded
to
the
market
-
place
,
where
they
halted
to
make
inquiries
respecting
Lord
Derwentwater
's
quarters
,
and
having
ascertained
that
he
occupied
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
house
in
Church
-
street
,
they
went
thither
.
<EOS>
These
ladies
attracted
considerable
attention
as
they
rode
along
,
but
no
one
could
tell
who
they
were
,
until
they
were
recognised
by
some
of
the
gentlemen
soldiers
,
as
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
and
Miss
Forster
,
the
general
's
sister
.
<EOS>
It
was
conjectured
that
the
grave
-
looking
personage
who
rode
beside
them
might
be
Father
Norman
,
the
earl
's
chaplain
,
and
the
old
man
-
servant
Mr.
Newbiggin
,
the
butler
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
When
the
arrival
of
the
countess
and
Miss
Forster
became
known
it
caused
a
great
sensation
in
the
place
,
and
the
news
soon
reached
General
Forster
,
who
chanced
to
be
walking
at
the
time
with
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
in
the
Fishergate
.
<EOS>
The
news
did
not
seem
altogether
agreeable
to
him
,
but
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
was
delighted
,
and
said
she
should
be
enchanted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
two
ladies
;
whereupon
,
the
complaisant
general
offered
to
introduce
her
to
them
forthwith
,
and
begged
her
to
accompany
him
to
Lord
Derwentwater
's
quarters
,
where
it
was
certain
they
would
be
found
.
<EOS>
As
the
countess
wished
to
take
her
husband
by
surprise
,
no
announcement
of
her
arrival
was
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
Alone
,
in
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
and
engaged
in
writing
a
letter
,
he
did
not
perceive
her
entrance
;
but
when
he
raised
his
eyes
,
and
beheld
her
standing
beside
him
,
he
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
,
and
springing
up
,
clasped
her
to
his
breast
.
"How
<EOS>
strange
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
after
the
first
expressions
of
delight
were
over
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
writing
to
you
to
say
I
wished
I
had
the
power
to
conjure
you
here
,
and
as
if
in
answer
to
the
summons
,
you
appear
.
<EOS>
""You
are
certainly
the
enchanter
,
who
has
brought
me
here
,
"
she
replied
,
smiling
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
alone
,
"
she
cried
.
"
<EOS>
Father
Norman
is
with
me
,
and
Newbiggin
;
and
I
have
also
brought
Dorothy
Forster
to
see
her
brother
.
<EOS>
""Dorothy
is
much
wanted
,
"
he
replied
.
"
<EOS>
But
tell
me
how
you
got
here
?
<EOS>
Have
you
experienced
any
hindrance
or
annoyance
on
the
road?""None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
We
set
out
from
Dilston
two
days
ago
,
and
got
to
Lancaster
yesterday
,
just
after
you
had
left
,
but
were
too
tired
to
follow
,
so
we
rested
there
,
and
came
on
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Do
not
imagine
that
I
intend
to
accompany
you
in
your
campaign
.
<EOS>
My
sole
object
in
coming
here
is
to
see
you
once
more
.
<EOS>
Left
by
myself
at
Dilston
<EOS>
I
became
so
unhappy
that
I
thought
I
should
have
died
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Father
Norman
offered
me
all
the
consolation
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
I
consulted
Dorothy
—
told
her
how
wretched
I
was
—
that
I
was
resolved
to
see
you
again
,
cost
what
it
might
—
and
she
agreed
to
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
Finding
nothing
could
turn
me
from
my
purpose
,
Father
Norman
likewise
volunteered
to
attend
me
—
nor
could
I
leave
Newbiggin
behind
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
not
done
wrong
in
bringing
him
.
<EOS>
There
are
plenty
of
faithful
servants
to
take
care
of
the
castle
during
my
absence
.
<EOS>
But
what
excellent
quarters
you
have
got
.
<EOS>
This
is
really
a
charming
house
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
I
believe
it
is
the
best
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
belongs
to
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
,
who
commands
the
Lancashire
militia
.
<EOS>
He
is
gone
to
Wigan
,
where
he
expects
to
be
joined

if
he
has
not
been
already
joined
—
by
General
Wills
,
with
several
regiments
of
dragoons
.
<EOS>
Our
foes
you
see
are
close
at
hand
,
yet
they
might
be
a
hundred
miles
off
for
aught
Forster
seems
to
care
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
the
command
of
the
army
,
I
should
have
fortified
myself
at
Lancaster
,
but
Forster
decided
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Now
we
may
have
to
stand
an
assault
here
.
<EOS>
And
Wills
is
not
our
only
enemy
.
<EOS>
General
Carpenter
is
advancing
from
Newcastle
,
and
possibly
may
overtake
us
,
ere
<EOS>
we
leave
Preston
.
<EOS>
""What
if
he
does
?
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
reason
to
fear
him
.
<EOS>
""With
Forster
at
our
head
,
we
shall
never
win
a
battle
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"You
are
dispirited
,
my
dear
lord
,
"
observed
the
countess
;
"
and
I
think
without
reason
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
I
could
think
so
<EOS>
,
"
he
rejoined
,
sadly
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
With
such
a
general
as
Forster
we
shall
do
no
good
.
<EOS>
But
where
are
Dorothy
and
Father
Norman?""I
<EOS>
left
them
in
the
large
room
opening
from
the
hall
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"I
must
go
and
bid
them
welcome
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
rejoiced
that
Dorothy
has
come
.
<EOS>
She
has
great
influence
with
her
brother
,
and
may
extricate
us
from
the
dreadful
dilemma
in
which
we
are
placed
.
<EOS>
""Finding
<EOS>
your
quarters
so
good
<EOS>
,
I
have
asked
her
to
stay
with
me
here
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
she
will
be
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
""Not
in
the
least
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
room
for
a
dozen
more
.
<EOS>
My
brother
Charles
is
the
only
person
in
the
house
with
me
,
and
nothing
can
be
more
agreeable
to
him
than
Dorothy
's
society
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
I
must
tell
you
that
since
his
arrival
here
,
the
general
has
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
a
fair
widow
—
Mrs
.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
I
mention
the
matter
because
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
soon
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
really
very
handsome
,
as
are
all
the
Preston
women
,
who
have
made
sad
work
with
most
of
the
young
men
in
my
regiment
.
<EOS>
They
are
half
crazed
about
them
.
<EOS>
But
come
along
,
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
remain
talking
here
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
Dorothy
and
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"Newbiggin
was
standing
in
the
passage
as
the
earl
came
forth
with
the
countess
,
and
received
a
very
kindly
greeting
from
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
,
Newbiggin
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
time
to
talk
to
you
now
,
but
I
shall
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
you
,
when
I
am
more
at
leisure
.
<EOS>
""Has
<EOS>
your
lordship
any
orders
to
give
me
?
"
inquired
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"Yes
.
<EOS>
Select
a
good
room
for
Miss
Forster
,
and
another
for
Father
Norman
,
and
let
all
be
got
ready
for
them
without
delay
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
lordship
will
find
them
in
this
room
,
"
he
added
,
opening
the
door
of
a
spacious
and
well
-
furnished
apartment
.

CHAPTER
IVMrs
.
<EOS>
ScarisbrickAs
<EOS>
the
earl
entered
Father
Norman
advanced
to
meet
him
,
and
saluting
him
affectionately
,
gave
him
his
benediction
.
<EOS>
This
little
ceremony
over
,
Lord
Derwentwater
addressed
himself
to
Dorothy
,
expressing
his
delight
at
seeing
her
,
and
thanking
her
for
her
kindness
in
accompanying
the
countess
on
the
hazardous
expedition
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
only
hope
you
will
have
no
cause
to
regret
your
obliging
compliance
with
her
wishes
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
stay
with
her
here
,
for
I
really
think
you
will
be
better
off
in
this
house
than
in
the
general
's
quarters
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
Dorothy
will
stay
with
me
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
sure
,
"
cried
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
part
with
her
.
"Dorothy
<EOS>
gladly
assented
to
the
arrangement
,
which
indeed
was
very
agreeable
to
her
,
and
this
matter
being
settled
,
the
earl
again
addressed
himself
to
Father
Norman
,
and
told
him
he
was
happy
in
being
able
to
offer
him
such
excellent
accommodation
.
<EOS>
"You
shall
have
as
good
a
room
as
you
have
been
accustomed
to
at
Dilston
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
beg
your
lordship
not
to
trouble
yourself
on
my
account
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
where
I
am
lodged
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
,
Newbiggin
came
in
and
announced
General
Forster
and
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
and
next
moment
the
general
made
his
appearance
with
the
young
widow
.
<EOS>
While
he
presented
her
to
the
countess
and
his
sister
,
the
priest
retired
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Both
ladies
were
very
much
struck
by
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
's
beauty
and
liveliness
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
seem
more
than
five
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
blonde
,
with
very
fine
eyes
and
pretty
features
,
and
had
a
graceful
figure
,
set
off
by
a
charming
dress
.
<EOS>
She
appeared
exceedingly
good
-
natured
,
and
was
certainly
very
desirous
to
please
.
<EOS>
Indeed
her
manner
was
so
engaging
that
both
ladies
were
delighted
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
that
surprised
Lady
Derwentwater
was
that
she
could
tolerate
such
a
man
as
Forster
.
<EOS>
"I
hope
your
lordship
and
Miss
Forster
will
like
Preston
,
"
she
said
after
her
presentation
to
them
by
the
general
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
do
our
best
to
amuse
you
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
war
's
alarms
,
a
good
deal
is
going
on
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
there
will
be
a
grand
ball
at
the
town
-
hall
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
a
very
gay
affair
.
<EOS>
All
the
officers
will
be
present
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
some
of
the
loveliest
women
you
ever
beheld
,
"
said
the
general
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
what
beauty
was
till
I
came
to
Preston
.
<EOS>
""Don't
<EOS>
mind
what
the
general
says
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
"
<EOS>
He
thinks
too
much
of
us
.
<EOS>
""I
ca
n't
think
too
much
of
you
,
"
sighed
Forster
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
you
flatter
,
"
said
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
if
Lady
Derwentwater
and
Miss
Forster
will
honour
the
ball
with
their
presence
,
they
will
be
able
to
judge
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
""Shall
we
go
to
this
ball
?
"
said
the
countess
to
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
all
means
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
very
numerously
attended
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
officers
,
all
my
gentlemen
soldiers
will
be
there
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
there
will
be
plenty
of
military
,
"
observed
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
may
think
I
am
jesting
,
but
I
assure
you
there
is
not
an
officer
or
a
trooper
in
the
Northumbrian
regiments
,
who
is
n't
in
love
.
<EOS>
""Beginning
with
the
general
himself
,
"
remarked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
,
I
own
the
soft
impeachment
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
Scarisbrick
affected
not
to
hear
the
observation
,
and
said
to
Lady
Derwentwater:"I
must
congratulate
your
ladyship
on
the
house
you
have
got
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
the
best
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
fancied
,
"
said
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
must
have
been
very
sorry
to
quit
it
.
<EOS>
""He
was
driven
out
by
General
Forster
's
approach
,
"
laughed
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
know
him
?
"
inquired
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Intimately
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
;
"
and
like
him
very
much
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
one
great
fault
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
Whig
and
a
Hanoverian
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
presume
you
are
a
Jacobite
?
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"As
ardent
a
Jacobite
as
your
ladyship
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
you
are
very
well
informed
,
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
"
observed
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
think
you
of
the
news
that
General
Wills
has
arrived
at
Wigan?""I
<EOS>
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
it
been
the
case
,
I
must
have
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
all
sorts
of
disquieting
rumours
at
present
—
but
General
Forster
need
n't
trouble
himself
about
them
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
n't
,
"
said
Forster
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"You
may
depend
upon
having
early
information
from
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
friends
at
Wigan
who
will
be
sure
to
send
me
word
if
anything
is
to
be
apprehended
.
<EOS>
You
may
therefore
rest
quite
easy
.
<EOS>
""Nevertheless
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
ought
to
advance
to
-
morrow
,
general
,
"
observed
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"To
-
morrow
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
Lady
Derwentwater
will
never
consent
to
that
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
would
if
there
were
any
necessity
for
the
step
,
"
rejoined
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
there
is
none
—
none
whatever
!
"
said
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
say
you
are
a
particular
friend
of
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
,
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
"
remarked
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
whether
you
have
heard
from
him
since
he
left?""I
had
a
letter
from
him
this
very
morning
,
"
she
replied
.
"Indeed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
countess
and
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"I
showed
it
to
General
Forster
,
as
he
will
tell
you
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
"
<EOS>
But
Sir
Henry
does
n't
say
a
word
about
General
Wills
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
very
likely
he
would
,
"
remarked
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
I
differ
with
you
,
"
said
the
general
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
certain
he
would
.
<EOS>
""So
am
I
,
"
said
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
have
other
correspondents
as
well
as
Sir
Henry
,
and
I
am
confident
they
would
have
sent
me
information
of
so
important
a
circumstance
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
think
we
may
rest
easy
for
the
present
?
"
observed
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"Perfectly
,
"
said
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
timely
information
of
any
danger
from
me
.
<EOS>
""No
need
to
send
a
spy
to
Wigan
to
watch
the
enemy
's
movements
,
"
observed
Forster
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
get
all
the
information
I
require
without
trouble
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
it
seems
,
"
remarked
Lord
Derwentwater
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
again
counsel
an
immediate
march
on
Wigan
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
nay
,
let
us
rest
quietly
here
for
a
day
or
two
,
and
enjoy
ourselves
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
have
better
quarters
.
<EOS>
Preston
has
a
hundred
recommendations
that
no
other
place
possesses
.
<EOS>
And
since
the
countess
has
joined
us
,
I
should
n't
have
thought
your
lordship
would
desire
to
move
.
<EOS>
What
says
your
ladyship
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
appealing
to
her
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
should
certainly
like
to
remain
here
for
a
day
or
two
,
if
it
can
be
done
with
safety
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"It
can
—
I'll
answer
for
it
,
"
said
Forster
;
"
and
since
I
am
responsible
for
any
mistake
,
you
may
be
sure
I
shall
be
careful
.
<EOS>
""Trust
to
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
I
will
procure
information
of
the
enemy
's
movements
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
she
to
be
relied
on
?
<EOS>
"
whispered
Dorothy
to
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
tell
,
"
he
replied
in
the
same
tone
.
"
<EOS>
But
your
brother
is
so
bewitched
that
he
will
never
move
.
<EOS>
You
must
look
after
him
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
<EOS>
VImportant
RecruitsJUST
then
a
great
tumult
was
heard
outside
,
and
the
ladies
flew
to
the
windows
,
which
looked
upon
the
street
,
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
disturbance
was
caused
by
the
arrival
of
some
five
or
six
well
-
mounted
gentlemen
,
each
attended
by
a
dozen
armed
retainers
on
horseback
,
so
that
they
formed
quite
a
troop
.
<EOS>
A
shouting
crowd
followed
them
,
adding
to
the
noise
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
,
who
had
likewise
rushed
to
the
window
,
was
greatly
delighted
by
the
sight
,
since
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
these
gentlemen
had
come
to
join
his
forces
.
<EOS>
They
had
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
his
quarters
,
and
were
told
by
one
of
the
sentinels
stationed
at
the
gate
,
that
the
general
was
then
at
Lord
Derwentwater
's
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
however
,
Lord
Widdrington
came
forth
,
and
shook
hands
very
heartily
with
one
of
the
recruits
,
a
very
fine
-
looking
man
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
is
that
handsome
and
distinguished
-
looking
person
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
countess
to
her
lord
,
who
had
followed
her
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
"That
is
Mr.
Townley
,
of
Townley
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
Lord
Widdrington
's
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
belongs
to
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
him
here
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
so
am
I
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Forster
,
joyfully
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Townley
is
a
great
acquisition
.
<EOS>
But
who
is
the
person
next
him?""I
can
tell
you
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
Mr.
Shuttleworth
of
Shuttleworth
Hall
,
and
belongs
to
as
old
a
family
as
Mr.
Townley
.
""Bravo
!
"
exclaimed
Forster
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
gentleman
next
him
,
"
said
Father
Norman
,
who
had
now
come
up
,
"
is
Sir
Francis
Anderton
,
of
Lostock
Hall
—
a
strict
Roman
Catholic
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
well
.
<EOS>
Next
him
is
another
Roman
Catholic
,
Mr.
Richard
Chorley
,
of
Chorley
.
<EOS>
""Who
comes
next
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Forster
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
Hesketh
,
of
Whitehall
,
near
St.
Michael's
-
le
-
Wyre
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
with
him
is
his
son
,
Mr.
Cuthbert
Hesketh
.
<EOS>
Then
comes
Mr.
John
Leyburne
,
of
Natesby
Hall
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
one
remains
—
Mr
.
<EOS>
Ralph
Standish
,
of
Standish
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
,
"
He
is
nearly
related
to
Mr.
Townley
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
these
gentlemen
belong
to
the
old
religion
,
"
observed
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"It
must
be
owned
that
the
Roman
Catholics
have
proved
loyal
to
King
James
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
the
High
Church
Tories
support
us
<EOS>
equally
well
we
can
not
fail
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
we
are
quite
sure
of
them
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
go
and
receive
our
distinguished
recruits
.
<EOS>
I
must
beg
your
lordship
to
come
with
me
,
"
he
added
to
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
They
were
about
to
leave
the
room
,
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
Lord
Widdrington
entered
with
Mr.
Townley
,
whom
he
presented
to
General
Forster
,
stating
that
he
was
come
to
join
the
insurgent
force
,
and
Forster
had
scarcely
welcomed
him
,
when
the
other
gentlemen
came
in
,
and
were
presented
in
like
manner
.
<EOS>
This
little
ceremony
gone
through
,
Forster
expressed
his
high
gratification
at
the
adherence
of
such
distinguished
persons
,
and
said:"To
prove
how
sensible
I
am
of
the
importance
of
your
accession
,
gentlemen
,
you
will
understand
that
you
all
join
with
the
rank
of
captain
,
and
I
am
quite
certain
you
will
do
credit
to
the
troops
you
will
command
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
courteous
act
,
as
judicious
as
good
-
natured
,
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
gentlemen
,
and
was
suitably
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
then
came
forward
,
and
welcomed
them
in
his
turn
,
offering
to
provide
them
all
with
quarters
in
his
large
house
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
servants
will
show
you
the
rooms
I
have
to
spare
,
gentlemen
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
if
you
like
them
,
they
are
quite
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
"Thanks
were
offered
his
lordship
for
the
obliging
offer
,
but
it
was
eventually
arranged
that
Mr.
Townley
and
Mr.
Standish
should
be
quartered
with
General
Forster
,
while
the
others
gladly
agreed
to
become
Lord
Derwentwater
's
guests
.
<EOS>
These
matters
being
arranged
,
the
gentlemen
were
presented
by
his
lordship
to
the
countess
,
and
by
General
Forster
to
his
sister
and
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
another
arrival
took
place
.
<EOS>
This
was
Mr.
Richard
Gascoigne
,
a
Roman
Catholic
gentleman
,
belonging
to
an
Irish
family
of
some
distinction
.
<EOS>
A
person
of
very
refined
manners
,
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
a
friend
of
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
by
whom
he
was
presented
to
General
Forster
,
and
like
those
who
had
preceded
him
was
complimented
with
the
rank
of
captain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
very
handsome
,
and
seemed
to
make
a
favourable
impression
upon
the
ladies
—
particularly
upon
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
The
general
offered
him
quarters
,
which
he
very
gladly
accepted
.
<EOS>
Several
other
important
additions
were
made
to
the
force
in
the
course
of
the
day
;
but
it
was
remarked
that
they
were
all
Roman
Catholics
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
promises
of
support
from
that
party
,
not
a
single
High
Church
Tory
joined
.
<EOS>
When
questioned
as
to
this
strange
falling
off
on
the
part
of
his
friends
,
General
Forster
declared
he
could
not
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
However
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
insurgent
army
was
considerably
augmented
.
<EOS>
On
the
second
day
after
their
arrival
at
Preston
,
the
rebels
numbered
more
than
four
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIThe
Ball
at
the
Town
-
HallTHOUGH
little
time
had
been
allowed
for
its
preparation
,
the
ball
at
the
town-
hall
was
really
very
brilliant
.
<EOS>
The
rooms
were
large
,
but
crowded
to
excess
,
and
space
could
with
difficulty
be
found
for
the
dancers
.
<EOS>
As
the
greater
part
of
the
male
guests
were
military
,
their
varied
costumes
added
materially
to
the
effect
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
leaders
of
all
the
English
and
Scottish
regiments
were
present
,
and
though
Brigadier
Mackintosh
rarely
appeared
at
such
an
assembly
,
his
tall
figure
could
be
descried
amid
the
gay
throng
.
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
course
,
General
Forster
was
there
—
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
most
important
guest
,
and
the
greatest
attention
was
paid
him
by
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
the
stewards
,
but
he
seemed
entirely
engrossed
by
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
who
attracted
most
attention
by
their
beauty
and
grace
were
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
and
Dorothy
Forster
.
<EOS>
Both
looked
charming
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
come
prepared
for
such
a
ball
,
but
their
dresses
were
very
becoming
.
<EOS>
They
were
attended
by
Lord
Widdrington
,
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
several
of
the
Scottish
nobles
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
was
not
very
far
off
,
but
he
was
engaged
in
converse
with
Mr.
Townley
,
Mr.
Standish
,
and
Sir
Francis
Anderton
.
<EOS>
At
this
ball
all
the
beauty
of
Preston
was
displayed
,
and
no
town
in
the
county
—
perhaps
no
town
in
the
kingdom
—
could
have
made
such
a
display
.
<EOS>
The
Preston
ladies
had
a
witchery
about
them
that
very
few
of
the
opposite
sex
could
resist
.
<EOS>
Wherein
the
charm
consisted
we
can
not
say
exactly
—
but
since
most
of
them
had
extremely
fine
eyes
,
their
glances
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
the
effect
of
the
fascination
was
manifest
.
<EOS>
All
submitted
to
the
influence
—
the
old
campaigner
as
well
as
the
young
recruit
.
<EOS>
Every
damsel
appeared
to
have
an
admirer
—
some
half
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
Whatever
political
opinions
they
had
heretofore
entertained
,
the
ladies
were
all
now
staunch
adherents
of
King
James
,
who
could
not
,
they
declared
,
be
better
represented
than
by
his
army
,
and
that
army
must
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
depart
.
<EOS>
So
far
from
desiring
to
go
,
the
gallant
young
troopers
declared
they
should
like
to
remain
at
Preston
for
ever
.
<EOS>
At
the
special
request
of
Captain
Shaftoe
,
the
handsome
young
recruits
from
Lancaster
had
been
invited
,
and
they
caused
quite
as
great
a
sensation
as
they
had
done
on
their
arrival
at
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
partners
,
for
all
the
young
ladies
were
anxious
to
dance
with
them
,
and
it
must
be
owned
that
they
danced
with
remarkable
spirit
and
grace
.
<EOS>
A
cotillon
in
which
they
figured
with
some
of
the
prettiest
girls
in
the
room
,
was
the
great
success
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
are
those
smart
young
fellows
?
"
inquired
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
who
was
looking
on
at
the
dance
with
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
"I
know
nothing
about
them
,
except
that
they
are
recruits
from
Lancaster
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
been
introduced
by
Captain
Shaftoe
.
<EOS>
You
must
apply
to
him
for
information
.
<EOS>
""They
<EOS>
dance
charmingly
,
"
observed
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
But
they
look
like
women
.
<EOS>
""They
may
be
women
for
aught
I
know
,
"
said
the
general
.
<EOS>
"
But
they
have
joined
as
troopers
—
at
least
,
Shaftoe
tells
me
so
.
<EOS>
He
is
speaking
to
their
captain
now
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
if
the
so
-
called
captain
is
not
a
woman
in
disguise
,
I
am
very
much
mistaken
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
The
music
having
struck
up
for
another
dance
the
young
sparks
ought
to
have
surrendered
their
partners
,
who
were
engaged
three
or
four
deep
,
instead
of
which
they
stood
up
with
them
again
—
a
course
of
proceeding
that
gave
great
umbrage
to
the
claimants
;
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
disturbance
arose
that
threw
the
whole
room
into
confusion
.
<EOS>
The
Lancaster
recruits
showed
great
spirit
,
and
refused
to
give
up
their
partners
,
defying
the
claimants
to
take
them
.
<EOS>
The
challenge
was
accepted
,
and
a
struggle
ensued
,
in
the
midst
of
which
screams
arose
,
and
it
was
found
that
three
of
the
Lancashire
youths
had
fainted
.
<EOS>
Their
sex
could
,
therefore
,
no
longer
be
concealed
;
and
it
then
came
out
,
as
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
had
suspected
,
that
they
were
a
party
of
young
damsels
,
who
had
followed
their
lovers
from
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
The
occurrence
caused
much
merriment
,
and
Captain
Shaftoe
had
to
undergo
a
good
deal
of
raillery
from
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
more
distinguished
guests
were
summoned
to
a
magnificent
supper
,
which
was
served
in
an
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
evening
there
were
several
Highland
dances
,
which
from
their
novelty
produced
a
great
effect
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
was
a
Highland
reel
,
in
which
Lady
Derwentwater
and
Dorothy
took
part
.
<EOS>
The
countess
danced
with
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
and
Dorothy
with
Colonel
Farquharson
of
Invercauld
,
and
acquitted
themselves
admirably
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
two
other
ladies
joined
the
reel
and
found
partners
in
the
Master
of
Nairn
and
Captain
Gordon
.
<EOS>
All
danced
with
great
spirit
to
the
stirring
accompaniment
of
the
pipes
.
<EOS>
A
Highland
fling
,
executed
by
Lord
Charles
Murray
and
Captain
Gordon
,
was
rewarded
by
the
applause
of
Brigadier
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
crowded
state
of
the
room
some
inconvenience
was
experienced
by
the
dancers
,
and
interruptions
occasionally
occurred
;
but
,
on
the
whole
,
the
ball
went
off
remarkably
well
,
and
was
long
afterwards
remembered
at
Preston
.
<EOS>
Many
ladies
,
then
in
their
bloom
,
used
to
boast
to
their
grand
-
daughters
,
that
they
had
danced
with
the
rebels
in
1715
,
and
they
invariably
added
,
"
Never
was
seen
such
a
fine
set
of
young
fellows
.
<EOS>
"Amid
<EOS>
that
scene
of
gaiety
and
excitement
,
when
all
the
young
men
yielded
to
the
soft
influence
of
beauty
,
few
thought
that
vigorous
preparations
for
attacking
them
were
being
made
by
their
foes
,
and
that
within
three
days
many
of
them
would
be
slain
,
and
the
rest
exiled
.
<EOS>
Had
such
thoughts
intruded
they
would
have
been
quickly
banished
.
<EOS>
But
the
revellers
were
not
troubled
by
any
such
disagreeable
reflections
.
<EOS>
Content
with
the
enjoyment
of
the
moment
,
they
gave
themselves
no
thought
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
otherwise
,
when
their
general
and
most
of
their
officers
set
them
such
an
example!But
<EOS>
there
was
one
person
amid
that
thoughtless
crowd
who
was
oppressed
with
care
,
and
felt
the
danger
in
which
the
invading
army
stood
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
,
if
this
culpable
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
general
should
continue
,
they
were
lost
.
<EOS>
Of
all
that
large
assemblage
which
boasted
the
presence
of
so
many
Scottish
nobles
and
gentlemen
—
so
many
wealthy
English
gentlemen
—
there
was
not
one
who
had
so
much
at
stake
as
he
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
at
his
lovely
wife
,
who
was
then
calling
forth
rapturous
admiration
in
the
Highland
dance
,
and
felt
how
soon
he
might
lose
her
,
he
could
scarcely
repress
the
pang
that
crossed
his
breast
.
<EOS>
But
she
seemed
full
of
excitement
,
and
when
she
came
back
to
him
with
Dorothy
,
he
strove
to
receive
them
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
was
not
allowed
much
repose
after
her
fatiguing
dance
.
<EOS>
She
was
carried
off
by
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
since
her
arrival
seemed
to
have
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
that
her
image
had
been
constantly
before
him
during
the
march
,
and
earnestly
besought
her
to
enter
into
an
engagement
with
him
.
<EOS>
To
this
Dorothy
replied
that
she
would
not
make
any
immediate
engagement
,
but
if
he
survived
the
campaign
,
and
renewed
his
suit
,
she
would
consider
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
promise
did
not
altogether
satisfy
him
,
but
he
was
obliged
to
be
content
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIRalph
FairbrotherSOMEWHAT
late
in
the
evening
,
Captain
Douglas
,
who
,
it
may
be
remembered
,
had
the
command
of
one
of
the
Northumbrian
regiments
,
informed
General
Forster
that
a
spy
had
been
arrested
,
but
the
general
was
so
much
engrossed
by
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
information
.
<EOS>
Captain
Douglas
then
spoke
to
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
who
at
once
went
with
him
to
a
small
room
where
the
man
was
detained
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
spy
had
been
recognised
as
Ralph
Fairbrother
,
for
whose
capture
a
reward
had
been
offered
,
and
who
was
supposed
to
have
gone
to
General
Carpenter
at
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
On
being
searched
a
letter
was
found
on
him
addressed
to
General
Wills
,
giving
particulars
of
the
exact
state
of
the
forces
,
and
making
some
remarks
on
Forster
's
incompetency
.
<EOS>
The
letter
bore
no
signature
,
but
was
in
a
female
hand
.
<EOS>
A
few
lines
,
traced
in
pencil
,
had
evidently
been
added
at
the
ball
,
and
this
important
postscript
recommended
an
immediate
attack
of
the
town
,
stating
that
it
must
be
successful
,
since
Forster
was
unprepared
.
<EOS>
After
reading
this
letter
,
and
considering
it
for
a
moment
,
the
brigadier
handed
it
to
Captain
Douglas
,
who
likewise
read
it
carefully
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
ye
guess
by
whom
it
is
written
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mackintosh
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
can
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Hark
ye
,
sirrah
!
"
said
Mackintosh
to
the
prisoner
,
who
was
looking
on
anxiously
,
"
if
you
desire
to
save
your
life
,
you
will
tell
us
who
wrote
this
letter
,
and
from
whom
you
received
it
.
<EOS>
""It
was
slipped
into
my
hand
,
"
replied
the
spy
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
I
know
about
it
.
<EOS>
""Were
<EOS>
you
not
engaged
by
a
lady
to
convey
it
to
General
Wills
?
<EOS>
Answer
plainly
.
<EOS>
""I
betray
no
confidences
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Fairbrother
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
General
Wills
at
Wigan
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Captain
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
And
how
many
regiments
of
infantry
,
horse
,
and
dragoons
,
has
he
got
with
him?""You
ask
questions
I
can
not
answer
,
captain
,
"
replied
Fairbrother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
would
not
answer
them
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
""Very
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
then
you
must
take
the
consequences
,
"
said
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
In
my
opinion
,
brigadier
,
this
man
ought
to
be
shot
.
<EOS>
""Humph
!
"
ejaculated
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
hear
what
General
Forster
says
.
<EOS>
""I
have
nothing
to
fear
from
General
Forster
,
"
observed
Fairbrother
.
<EOS>
"Aha
!
say
you
so
?
"
exclaimed
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
.
<EOS>
"They
then
left
him
in
custody
,
and
returned
to
the
ball
-
room
.
<EOS>
Forster
was
still
at
supper
with
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
and
declined
to
have
a
private
consultation
with
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"I
will
attend
to
business
in
the
morning
—
not
now
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
we
have
discovered
a
spy
,
"
observed
Mackintosh
,
looking
fixedly
at
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
;
"
and
have
found
this
letter
upon
him
.
<EOS>
""Give
it
<EOS>
me
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
snatching
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
read
it
to
the
general
.
<EOS>
""Madam
,
"
cried
the
brigadier
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
I
insist
that
you
place
that
letter
in
the
general
's
own
hands
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
want
to
see
it
,
"
observed
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
troubled
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
To-
morrow
,
will
be
quite
time
enough
.
<EOS>
Keep
it
for
me
till
then
.
<EOS>
""You
will
never
see
it
,
"
cried
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
I
desire
,
madam
,
that
the
letter
may
be
at
once
returned
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
shall
be
compelled
to
take
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
""Am
I
to
be
exposed
to
this
insult
,
general
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"Certainly
<EOS>
not
,
"
replied
Forster
,
rising
from
his
seat
—
though
not
without
some
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
Brigadier
,
I
must
request
you
to
retire
.
<EOS>
""I
obey
,
"
replied
Mackintosh
.
"
<EOS>
But
understand
that
I
will
shoot
this
spy
.
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
of
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
""Do
as
you
please
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
Shoot
half
a
dozen
spies
if
you
find
them
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
do
n't
let
him
shoot
the
man
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
be
alarmed
,
"
said
Forster
,
sitting
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
will
only
be
kept
in
the
guardhouse
to
night
.
<EOS>
I
'll
settle
the
matter
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Take
some
more
champagne
.
<EOS>
"Reassured
<EOS>
by
this
promise
,
and
having
got
the
letter
,
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
nothing
to
fear
from
poor
Fairbrother
.
<EOS>
At
break
of
day
,
he
was
taken
by
a
file
of
Highlanders
to
the
fields
near
the
Wigan
-
lane
,
and
there
shot
.
<EOS>
The
new
chaplain
of
the
forces
attended
him
in
his
last
moments
.
<EOS>
In
explanation
of
this
summary
act
of
justice
,
Brigadier
Mackintosh
caused
it
to
be
announced
that
the
man
was
a
spy
.
<EOS>
This
act
might
have
been
blamed
,
but
circumstances
occurred
that
seemed
to
justify
its
severity
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIIApathy
of
General
ForsterON
<EOS>
the
same
morning
,
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
accompanied
by
the
countess
and
Dorothy
,
and
attended
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Captain
Gordon
,
but
without
any
guard
,
rode
down
to
the
Ribble
Bridge
.
<EOS>
While
the
earl
was
inspecting
the
bridge
,
and
the
ladies
were
admiring
the
river
,
and
the
view
of
the
town
from
the
spot
,
their
attention
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
horse
's
footsteps
,
and
immediately
afterwards
a
man
galloped
up
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
ridden
on
,
but
Captain
Gordon
stopped
him
,
and
led
him
to
the
earl
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
he
had
left
Wigan
early
in
the
morning
,
and
brought
very
important
intelligence
.
<EOS>
General
Wills
was
undoubtedly
there
,
and
having
been
joined
by
six
more
regiments
of
dragoons
on
the
preceding
evening
,
it
was
certain
he
would
make
immediate
arrangements
to
attack
the
insurgents
,
so
that
they
must
be
prepared
for
him
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
this
intelligence
,
the
earl
at
once
returned
to
the
town
,
and
proceeded
to
General
Forster
's
quarters
,
but
could
not
see
him
,
as
the
general
had
not
yet
risen
,
being
much
fatigued
by
the
ball
.
<EOS>
Instigated
by
the
countess
and
Dorothy
,
the
earl
determined
to
take
all
the
responsibility
upon
himself
,
and
ordered
Charles
Radclyffe
to
take
his
regiment
to
defend
Ribble
Bridge
.
<EOS>
But
before
the
order
could
be
obeyed
,
Forster
appeared
and
countermanded
it
.
<EOS>
"It
seems
to
me
,
"
said
the
general
,
"
that
my
authority
is
set
at
naught
.
<EOS>
A
man
has
been
shot
as
a
spy
by
Brigadier
Mackintosh
without
consulting
me
,
and
now
orders
are
given
that
a
guard
shall
advance
towards
Wigan
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
next
order
will
be
that
the
whole
army
shall
get
ready
to
march
.
<EOS>
""It
ought
to
be
,
"
said
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
loitering
here
far
too
long
,
and
will
be
surprised
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Are
you
aware
that
General
Wills
has
just
been
joined
by
several
more
regiments?""I
<EOS>
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
,
"
rejoined
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
such
been
the
case
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
been
informed
of
it
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
a
scout
has
just
returned
from
Wigan
,
"
cried
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
seen
him
,
and
spoken
with
him
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
question
him
yourself?""'Tis
needless
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
has
been
imposed
upon
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
will
neither
march
against
the
enemy
,
nor
take
any
steps
for
the
defence
of
the
town
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
"Not
unless
I
receive
accurate
intelligence
,
"
rejoined
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
under
no
apprehension
.
<EOS>
""Was
<EOS>
there
ever
such
obstinacy
?
"
exclaimed
the
earl
,
turning
away
in
disgust
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
'
tis
in
vain
to
reason
with
him
,
"
he
added
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
lordship
will
understand
,
"
said
Forster
,
"
that
to
-
morrow
I
shall
commence
the
march
to
Manchester
.
<EOS>
""To
-
morrow
we
shall
not
be
able
to
leave
Preston
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
shall
see
,
"
replied
Forster
,
laughing
.
"
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
I
recommend
you
to
make
the
most
of
your
time
,
and
enjoy
yourself
while
you
can
.
<EOS>
There
is
another
banquet
at
the
town
-
hall
today
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
the
last
time
,
I
ask
you
if
you
are
resolved
not
to
move?""Not
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
replied
Forster
,
positively
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
about
to
give
general
orders
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
countess
and
Dorothy
looked
aghast
.
<EOS>
"What
is
to
be
done
?
"
cried
the
former
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
We
are
doomed
.
<EOS>
"The
announcement
that
the
general
did
not
mean
to
continue
his
march
south
till
the
morrow
was
very
agreeable
to
the
majority
of
the
army
—
indeed
a
great
many
of
the
gentlemen
troopers
hoped
that
when
the
morrow
came
there
would
be
another
delay
.
<EOS>
They
were
quite
as
infatuated
as
the
general
,
and
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
the
society
of
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
A
large
party
collected
on
the
Ribble
Bridge
,
but
it
was
with
no
intention
of
defending
it
.
<EOS>
Another
banquet
was
given
at
the
town
-
hall
,
to
which
the
leaders
and
officers
were
bidden
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
few
ladies
invited
,
were
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
,
Dorothy
Forster
,
and
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
Since
the
last
-
mentioned
lady
was
present
,
the
general
was
quite
happy
,
and
perfectly
indifferent
to
the
future
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
festive
meeting
,
there
were
innumerable
tea
-
parties
,
where
the
gentlemen
troopers
were
very
agreeably
entertained
;
while
the
Mitre
,
the
White
Bull
,
and
the
Windmill
were
filled
to
overflowing
with
guests
.
<EOS>
With
this
pleasant
evening
passed
away
the
gaieties
of
Preston
.
<EOS>
No
more
flirting
—
no
more
carousing
.
<EOS>
All
merriment
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
morrow
's
sun
arose
on
a
day
of
strife
and
slaughter
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IXParson
Woods
of
ChowbentWHILE
the
whole
insurgent
army
is
feasting
and
carousing
,
we
shall
repair
to
Wigan
,
and
see
what
General
Wills
is
about
.
<EOS>
Wigan
,
a
very
different
town
from
what
it
is
at
present
,
was
filled
with
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Besides
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
six
hundred
militiamen
,
and
three
regiments
of
foot
,
respectively
commanded
by
Captains
Sabine
,
Fane
,
and
Preston
,
there
was
a
fine
regiment
of
horse
,
commanded
by
Colonel
Pitt
,
and
five
regiments
of
dragoons
,
commanded
by
Major
-
General
Wynn
,
Colonels
Honeywood
,
Dormer
,
Munden
,
and
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
Whether
Wills
was
an
able
general
may
be
questioned
,
but
he
was
an
active
and
very
determined
man
.
<EOS>
Strongly
built
and
well
made
,
he
had
a
military
bearing
,
and
a
stern
,
inflexible
countenance
.
<EOS>
Obstinate
he
was
,
but
his
obstinacy
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
incompetent
Forster
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
turned
from
his
purpose
by
advice
,
but
his
plans
were
carefully
considered
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
constant
communication
with
General
Carpenter
,
but
feeling
certain
he
could
defeat
the
rebels
unaided
,
his
great
desire
was
to
attack
them
before
Carpenter
came
up
,
so
that
he
might
gain
all
the
glory
of
the
victory
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
he
hurried
on
his
preparations
—
though
not
unduly
so
.
<EOS>
Having
a
secret
correspondent
in
Preston
,
he
knew
the
exact
numbers
of
the
force
,
and
was
also
aware
of
the
utter
incompetency
of
Forster
,
but
he
thought
the
chief
command
might
be
taken
,
at
the
last
moment
,
by
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
He
had
likewise
some
fears
of
Mackintosh
,
with
whose
valour
and
skill
he
was
well
acquainted
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
felt
sure
of
an
easy
conquest
,
and
was
impatient
to
achieve
it
.
<EOS>
While
General
Wills
was
arranging
his
plans
for
the
attack
,
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
came
into
his
room
,
and
said:"Acting
on
a
suggestion
of
your
own
,
general
,
I
have
begged
the
Presbyterian
ministers
in
this
neighbourhood
—
many
of
whom
are
well
known
to
me
—
to
induce
their
congregations
to
assist
me
in
this
struggle
against
Popery
,
and
I
am
extremely
happy
to
say
I
have
succeeded
—
at
least
,
in
one
instance
.
<EOS>
The
Reverend
James
Woods
,
Presbyterian
minister
of
Chowbent
,
has
promptly
and
energetically
responded
to
my
appeal
.
<EOS>
The
worthy
man
has
used
such
exertions
that
he
has
already
got
together
a
troop
of
some
forty
or
fifty
active
young
men
.
<EOS>
For
the
most
part
they
are
armed
with
scythes
,
fixed
on
straight
poles
,
and
bill
-
hooks
,
but
they
are
stout
active
young
fellows
,
and
will
undoubtedly
do
good
service
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
they
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Wills
.
<EOS>
"They
are
,
general
,
"
replied
Sir
Henry
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
is
their
pastor
,
the
Reverend
James
Woods
.
<EOS>
""I
will
see
him
at
once
,
"
replied
Wills
.
<EOS>
He
then
went
forth
with
Sir
Henry
,
and
in
front
of
the
old
house
,
where
he
had
fixed
his
quarters
,
he
found
a
large
party
of
stalwart
-
looking
young
fellows
armed
with
the
weapons
described
.
<EOS>
At
their
head
was
a
sturdy
-
looking
individual
,
of
middle
age
,
clad
in
a
suit
of
black
,
and
having
a
well
-
powdered
wig
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
decidedly
clerical
appearance
,
he
had
a
brace
of
pistols
in
his
belt
,
and
a
sword
girt
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
General
Wills
could
not
help
smiling
when
he
beheld
him
.
<EOS>
Still
he
perceived
at
a
glance
that
the
parson
would
prove
serviceable
,
and
he
therefore
gave
him
a
hearty
welcome
.
<EOS>
"I
am
very
glad
to
find
,
Mr.
Woods
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
you
have
come
to
assist
the
Government
at
this
crisis
.
<EOS>
Rest
assured
your
conduct
will
be
appreciated
in
the
right
quarter
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
and
a
portion
of
my
flock
have
come
to
fight
for
the
king
,
general
,
"
replied
the
minister
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
uphold
him
against
a
Popish
Pretender
.
<EOS>
We
are
ready
to
take
any
part
you
may
be
pleased
to
assign
us
,
and
I
promise
you
the
rebels
shall
meet
with
a
stout
resistance
from
us
.
<EOS>
""They
<EOS>
shall
,
"
cried
the
men
,
brandishing
their
scythes
and
bill
-
hooks
.
<EOS>
"I
thankfully
accept
your
offer
,
"
said
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
promise
no
more
than
you
will
perform
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
morning
,
at
an
early
hour
,
I
shall
march
to
Preston
to
give
battle
to
the
rebels
,
and
you
shall
go
with
me
,
or
rather
shall
march
on
before
me
—
so
that
you
can
take
up
a
position
before
I
come
up
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
Penwortham
—
about
two
miles
below
the
bridge
over
the
Ribble?""I
<EOS>
know
the
place
<EOS>
well
,
general
,
"
replied
Woods
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
,
which
is
there
fordable
.
<EOS>
""Exactly
.
<EOS>
It
is
that
ford
I
wish
you
to
guard
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
that
it
may
become
a
post
of
danger
,
as
some
of
the
rebels
may
attempt
to
escape
that
way
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
care
for
danger
,
"
said
the
valiant
pastor
;
"
and
I
hope
I
shall
take
many
prisoners
.
<EOS>
""If
necessary
,
a
party
of
men
shall
be
sent
to
support
you
,
"
said
Wills
.
<EOS>
"I
trust
we
shall
not
need
support
,
general
,
"
said
the
pastor
,
resolutely
.
<EOS>
"
Before
the
day
is
over
I
fancy
my
followers
will
have
got
some
better
arms
than
they
now
possess
.
<EOS>
""Decidedly
,
you
ought
to
have
been
a
soldier
,
reverend
sir
,
"
observed
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
done
credit
to
the
profession
.
<EOS>
Now
,
will
you
remain
here
for
the
night
,
or
march
on
with
your
men
to
Chorley
,
so
as
to
have
less
to
do
to-
<EOS>
morrow?""We
will
adopt
the
latter
course
,
general
,
"
replied
the
pastor
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
halt
for
the
night
at
a
small
place
called
Whittle
-
in
-
the
-
Woods
,
about
six
miles
from
Penwortham
.
<EOS>
We
can
take
up
our
post
early
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
further
orders
to
give
me?""None
,
"
replied
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
you
will
take
some
refreshment
before
you
set
out
on
your
march
.
<EOS>
""All
is
ready
for
you
,
"
said
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
,
advancing
.
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me

bring
your

with
you

"Parson
<EOS>
Woods
willingly
complied
with

the

accompanied
Sir

Thoroughly

CHAPTER
XGeneral
Wills
arrives
at
PrestonHAVING
fully
arranged
his
plans
,
General
Wills
,
summoned
the
various
commanders
,
and
after
explaining
to
them
his
views
,
made
the
following
disposition
of
his
forces
.
<EOS>
The
horse
and
dragoons
were
to
be
formed
into
three
brigades
:
the
first
to
consist
of
Wynn
's
and
Honeywood
's
regiments
,
under
the
command
of
Brigadier
Honeywood
;
the
second
to
comprise
Munden
's
and
Stanhope
's
regiments
,
under
the
command
of
Brigadier
Munden
;
and
the
third
to
comprehend
Pitt
and
Dormer
's
regiments
,
under
the
command
of
Brigadier
Dormer
.
"We
<EOS>
shall
set
out
at
break
of
day
,
"
said
the
general
,
"
and
this
will
be
the
order
of
march
.
<EOS>
In
the
front
will
be
Preston
's
foot
,
with
a
vanguard
of
fifty
men
from
the
regiment
,
commanded
by
Lord
Forrester
.
<EOS>
Then
will
follow
the
three
brigades
I
have
appointed
,
while
the
whole
of
the
militia
,
under
the
command
of
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
,
will
bring
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
""Am
I
to
cross
the
bridge
,
general
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Sir
Henry
,
who
was
present
.
<EOS>
"Most
<EOS>
probably
the
bridge
and
the
approaches
to
it
will
be
defended
,
"
replied
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
Post
your
men
at
various
points
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Station
two
parties
of
horse
about
a
hundred
yards
apart
on
the
left
of
the
bridge
,
and
place
small
parties
along
the
bank
as
far
as
the
ferry
-
house
,
extending
them
,
if
necessary
,
in
the
direction
of
Penwortham
,
where
Parson
Woods
will
be
posted
with
his
men
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
whole
of
the
bank
will
be
guarded
,
and
no
supplies
can
be
conveyed
to
the
rebels
—
nor
can
any
of
them
escape
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
quite
understand
,
general
,
"
said
Sir
Henry
,
"
and
will
carefully
attend
to
your
instructions
.
<EOS>
""One
<EOS>
word
more
,
gentlemen
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
done
,
"
said
Wills
,
looking
round
.
<EOS>
"
As
we
shall
set
out
as
soon
as
it
is
light
,
you
must
all
be
on
the
alert
an
hour
before
daybreak
,
so
as
to
prevent
any
chance
of
delay
.
<EOS>
This
applies
particularly
to
the
foot
and
the
advanced
guard
,
who
ought
to
start
half
an
hour
before
the
horse
.
<EOS>
We
shall
halt
for
an
hour
at
Chorley
,
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
anticipation
of
the
day
they
had
before
them
,
the
commanders
and
officers
retired
early
to
rest
.
<EOS>
But
not
till
he
had
satisfied
himself
by
personal
inspection
that
all
the
regiments
under
his
command
were
in
good
marching
order
did
General
Wills
seek
his
couch
.
<EOS>
Fully
an
hour
before
daybreak
the
reveillé
was
sounded
,
and
it
was
scarcely
light
when
the
vanguard
,
commanded
by
Lord
Forrester
,
marched
out
of
Wigan
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
interval
,
the
advanced
guard
was
followed
by
Preston
's
regiment
of
foot
—
known
as
the
Old
Cameronians
—
which
could
boast
some
of
the
finest
men
in
the
service
.
<EOS>
Then
followed
,
after
another
pause
,
the
three
brigades
of
cavalry
;
and
both
men
and
horses
being
in
excellent
condition
,
these
regiments
looked
remarkably
well
.
<EOS>
General
Wills
rode
with
Brigadier
Honeywood
at
the
head
of
the
first
brigade
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
train
of
baggage
wagons
came
the
militia
,
numbering
some
six
hundred
horse
and
foot
,
commanded
by
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
.
<EOS>
Like
the
regular
soldiers
,
the
militiamen
looked
exceedingly
well
,
and
were
loudly
cheered
by
the
inhabitants
,
most
of
whom
—
though
the
hour
was
so
early
—
had
assembled
to
witness
the
march
forth
of
the
troops
.
<EOS>
The
spectacle
was
rendered
infinitely
more
impressive
by
the
circumstance
that
the
men
were
about
to
fight
a
battle
.
<EOS>
The
result
,
however
,
of
the
impending
contest
seemed
scarcely
doubtful
,
and
the
general
opinion
was
that
the
rebellion
would
be
effectually
crushed
.
<EOS>
Confident
in
their
leader
,
and
animated
by
their
officers
,
who
promised
them
an
easy
victory
over
the
insurgents
,
with
the
plunder
of
the
rich
town
of
Preston
,
the
king
's
soldiers
were
in
excellent
spirits
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
anything
occur
in
the
march
to
disquiet
them
.
<EOS>
The
morning
being
fine
and
the
roads
in
tolerably
good
order
,
the
infantry
got
on
very
well
,
and
were
very
little
fatigued
on
reaching
Chorley
.
<EOS>
During
the
halt
at
Chorley
,
word
was
brought
to
General
Wills
by
a
scout
that
the
bridge
over
the
Ribble
was
defended
by
Colonel
John
Farquharson
of
Invercauld
,
with
a
hundred
picked
men
belonging
to
Colonel
Mackintosh
's
battalion
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
had
likewise
come
forth
to
reconnoitre
,
and
had
been
seen
with
a
party
of
horse
about
two
miles
south
of
the
bridge
,
on
the
Wigan
road
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
did
not
seem
to
necessitate
any
alteration
in
General
Wills
's
plans
,
but
he
ordered
Lord
Forrester
and
Captain
Preston
to
halt
at
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
till
he
himself
should
come
up
.
<EOS>
After
this
short
halt
the
march
was
resumed
,
and
on
arriving
at
Walton
-
le-
Dale
,
the
general
learnt
that
Colonel
Farquharson
had
been
strengthened
by
three
hundred
men
sent
to
support
him
by
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
Under
the
impression
that
the
bridge
would
be
stoutly
defended
,
Wills
prepared
to
attack
it
with
Honeywood
's
brigade
,
but
what
was
his
surprise
,
on
arriving
at
the
spot
,
to
find
the
passage
entirely
unoccupied!What
had
become
of
Colonel
Farquharson
and
his
Highlanders
?
<EOS>
Where
were
Lord
Derwentwater
's
three
hundred
men
?
<EOS>
Not
one
of
them
was
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Though
there
was
nothing
to
impede
his
progress
,
Wills
hesitated
for
a
few
minutes
,
suspecting
some
stratagem
might
be
intended
.
<EOS>
He
then
rode
boldly
across
the
bridge
,
and
was
followed
by
his
whole
force
,
with
the
exception
of
the
militia
,
which
remained
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
,
and
took
up
the
position
assigned
.
<EOS>
After
crossing
the
bridge
Wills
again
halted
before
entering
the
deep
lane
that
led
to
the
town
,
and
thinking
the
hedges
might
be
lined
,
he
caused
them
to
be
examined
,
but
no
skirmishers
could
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
Unable
,
otherwise
,
to
account
for
such
strange
neglect
of
all
precautions
,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
rebels
must
have
abandoned
the
town
,
and
commenced
a
retreat
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Should
this
prove
to
be
the
case
,
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
him
,
as
well
as
to
his
soldiery
,
since
it
would
deprive
him
of
victory
,
and
the
men
of
the
plunder
they
expected
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
However
,
his
alarm
was
quickly
dispelled
.
<EOS>
A
prisoner
had
been
taken
,
and
was
brought
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
refused
to
answer
the
sergeant
who
first
interrogated
him
,
but
as
Wills
threatened
to
have
him
shot
,
he
became
more
compliant
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
are
the
rebels
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
general
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
town
,
"
replied
the
man
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
General
Forster
there
?
<EOS>
"
continued
Wills
.
<EOS>
"I
suppose
so
,
"
said
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater?""Maybe
,
"
replied
the
man
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
seen
him
.
<EOS>
""Take
<EOS>
care
how
you
answer
,
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wills
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
quite
sure
Brigadier
Mackintosh
has
not
set
out
for
Scotland?""Quite
<EOS>
sure
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
not
half
an
hour
ago
—
helping
to
make
a
barricade
.
<EOS>
""A
barricade
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Wills
,
glancing
at
Brigadier
Honeywood
.
<EOS>
"
Now
we
are
coming
to
it
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
barricade
formed
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
Churchgate
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
that
the
only
barrier?""No
,
there
are
three
others
.
<EOS>
All
the
entrances
to
the
town
are
barricaded
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
the
rebels
mean
to
defend
themselves
?
"
said
Wills
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
last
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
expect
them
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
they
do
n't
,
I
shall
cut
them
to
pieces
,
"
said
Wills
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Go
back
to
the
town
and
tell
them
so
.
<EOS>
""I
wo
n't
deliver
any
such
message
.
<EOS>
It
would
cost
me
my
life
.
<EOS>
""No
matter
,
"
cried
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
Obey
me
.
<EOS>
Recollect
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
rebels
shall
escape
me
—
unless
their
leaders
surrender
at
discretion
.
<EOS>
Now
begone!"The
man
was
then
set
free
,
and
driven
towards
the
town
,
but
he
did
not
re-
enter
it
.
<EOS>
General
Wills
then
quitted
the
lane
,
which
was
shut
in
,
as
we
have
said
,
by
high
hedges
,
and
led
his
troops
to
some
fields
on
the
left
that
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
How
peaceful
and
beautiful
it
looked
!
<EOS>
Even
the
stern
Wills
,
who
was
about
to
deliver
it
up
to
fire
and
sword
,
felt
a
certain
regret
at
the
thought
of
destroying
so
pleasant
a
place
.
<EOS>
Very
few
evidences
of
preparation
on
the
part
of
the
insurgents
were
visible
,
the
barriers
and
intrenchments
being
all
in
the
interior
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
A
few
soldiers
could
be
descried
at
the
outskirts
,
but
no
guard
was
placed
at
the
extremity
of
the
avenues
.
<EOS>
Wills
quite
understood
what
this
meant
,
and
judged
correctly
that
the
houses
on
either
side
of
the
streets
must
be
filled
with
troops
ready
to
pour
a
murderous
fire
upon
the
assailants
as
they
entered
the
town
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
cavalry
could
not
act
within
the
town
,
Wills
gave
orders
that
two
regiments
of
dragoons
should
dismount
,
when
the
attack
was
made
,
in
order
to
support
the
foot
.
<EOS>
His
first
business
,
however
,
was
to
dispose
his
men
so
as
to
prevent
the
rebels
from
sallying
forth
,
and
cut
off
their
retreat
in
case
they
should
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
ordered
two
attacks
to
be
made
simultaneously
upon
the
town
;
one
by
Brigadier
Honeywood
from
the
Wigan
road
on
the
south
—
the
other
by
Brigadiers
Dormer
and
Munden
from
the
Lancaster
road
on
the
north
.
<EOS>
His
directions
were
thus
conveyed
to
Honeywood:"You
will
have
with
you
Preston
's
regiment
of
foot
to
be
commanded
by
Lord
Forrester
,
likewise
two
hundred
and
fifty
dismounted
dragoons
,
commanded
by
five
captains
.
<EOS>
These
are
to
support
Preston
's
foot
.
<EOS>
You
will
sustain
the
whole
with
your
regiment
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
orders
shall
be
obeyed
,
general
,
"
replied
Honeywood
.
<EOS>
Wills
then
gave
similar
directions
to
Brigadiers
Dormer
and
Munden
,
telling
them
they
would
have
under
their
joint
command
three
hundred
dismounted
dragoons
for
the
attack
on
the
Lancaster
avenue
,
which
would
be
sustained
by
two
mounted
regiments
.
<EOS>
Then
addressing
the
brigadiers
he
added,"Obtain
possession
of
the
ends
of
the
town
as
speedily
as
may
be
,
and
set
fire
to
the
houses
,
in
order
to
dislodge
the
rebels
,
who
no
doubt
occupy
them
.
<EOS>
Next
make
lodgments
for
your
own
men
,
so
as
to
prevent
the
sallying
forth
of
the
rebels
upon
them
,
and
check
the
escape
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
,
general
,
"
said
Brigadier
Dormer
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
commencing
hostilities
,
however
,
I
shall
send
a
summons
of
surrender
to
General
Forster
,
"
said
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
think
he
will
comply
with
it
.
<EOS>
"Scarcely
<EOS>
were
the
words
spoken
,
than
several
shots
were
fired
from
a
farm-
yard
near
the
town
,
by
which
an
orderly
near
the
general
was
killed
,
and
another
officer
wounded
.
"Soh
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wills
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
There
will
now
be
no
summons
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
Let
the
attack
commence
forthwith
.
<EOS>
"Brigadiers
<EOS>
Dormer
and
Munden
with
the
regiments
under
their
command
,
then
rode
off
to
the
north
side
of
the
town
to
attack
the
Lancaster
avenue
;
while
Lord
Forrester
led
Preston
's
foot
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
Wigan
avenue
,
followed
by
the
dismounted
dragoons
,
and
sustained
by
Brigadier
Honeywood
's
regiment
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
sharp
firing
announced
that
the
attack
had
commenced
on
both
sides
of
the
town

THE
DEFENCECHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
BarricadesRUDELY
awakened
from
his
slumbers
at
a
far
earlier
hour
than
he
usually
allowed
himself
to
be
disturbed
,
by
the
intelligence
that
Wills
was
marching
to
attack
him
with
his
whole
force
,
and
scarcely
able
,
even
then
,
to
credit
the
unwelcome
news
,
and
with
an
aching
head
,
General
Forster
attired
himself
in
haste
,
and
,
ordering
a
small
troop
of
horse
to
attend
him
,
rode
forth
to
reconnoitre
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
Ribble
Bridge
,
he
found
a
party
of
Highlanders
placed
there
,
and
was
informed
by
Colonel
Farquharson
,
who
commanded
them
,
that
the
king
's
army
was
certainly
approaching
.
<EOS>
Still
doubting
,
the
general
rode
on
for
a
few
miles
further
,
when
he
descried
the
vanguard
of
the
enemy
,
and
quickly
turned
back
.
<EOS>
In
the
interval
the
Highlanders
had
left
the
bridge
,
their
place
being
taken
by
three
hundred
of
Lord
Derwentwater
's
men
,
under
the
command
of
Captain
Shaftoe
.
<EOS>
Angry
that
this
change
should
have
been
made
without
his
sanction
,
Forster
ordered
Shaftoe
to
abandon
the
bridge
and
return
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
very
reluctantly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Captain
Shaftoe
would
fain
have
proceeded
to
Penwortham
to
dislodge
Parson
Woods
,
but
was
not
allowed
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
his
return
to
the
town
,
General
Forster
summoned
a
council
of
war
,
which
was
attended
by
all
the
English
and
Scottish
leaders
.
<EOS>
They
were
quite
alive
to
the
danger
of
their
position
,
and
evidently
had
very
little
reliance
either
on
the
judgment
or
skill
of
their
commander
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
the
advice
of
Brigadier
Mackintosh
was
urgently
requested
by
Lord
Derwentwater
and
others
.
<EOS>
"You
have
greater
military
experience
than
any
of
us
,
brigadier
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
What
plan
do
you
suggest?""Will
you
follow
out
my
plan
,
if
I
offer
it
?
"
said
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
will
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
waste
time
in
discussion
,
the
enemy
will
be
upon
us
.
<EOS>
""Aweel
,
then
,
"
said
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
useless
to
defend
the
bridge
,
since
the
river
is
fordable
in
many
places
,
nor
do
I
think
it
would
be
safe
to
risk
a
battle
outside
the
town
,
because
the
Highlanders
have
not
yet
learned
to
face
cavalry
.
<EOS>
Nothing
frightens
them
so
much
as
a
charge
of
horse
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
I
would
have
the
battle
take
place
within
the
town
,
where
the
cavalry
,
of
which
the
enemy
's
force
chiefly
consists
,
will
be
least
serviceable
,
and
where
the
Highlanders
will
fight
well
.
<EOS>
Barricades
and
intrenchments
can
be
thrown
up
in
different
parts
of
the
streets
so
as
to
impede
the
advance
of
the
enemy
,
and
a
destructive
fire
can
be
poured
upon
them
from
the
roofs
and
windows
of
the
houses
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
approved
of
the
plan
,
except
Forster
,
and
he
was
overruled
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
many
barricades
shall
<EOS>
we
require?—and
where
do
you
propose
to
erect
them
?
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"Four
will
suffice
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
In
fact
,
we
have
n't
time
to
form
more
.
<EOS>
The
first
shall
be
placed
a
little
below
the
church
,
and
as
it
is
likely
to
be
the
chief
object
of
attack
,
I
will
take
the
command
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
not
make
it
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
street
,
so
as
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
the
enemy
?
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"There
are
so
many
lanes
and
avenues
thereabouts
that
I
should
require
more
men
than
I
possess
to
defend
the
post
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
The
second
barrier
will
be
best
placed
,
in
my
opinion
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
now
occupied
by
Lord
Derwentwater
,
and
I
would
have
it
commanded
by
Lord
Charles
Murray
.
<EOS>
""I
accept
the
post
,
"
replied
the
gallant
young
nobleman
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
third
barrier
should
be
in
the
Fishergate
,
"
pursued
the
brigadier
;
"
and
it
would
be
well
served
by
Lord
Strathmore
's
men
,
under
the
command
of
Captain
Douglas
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
you
have
named
me
to
a
post
of
danger
,
brigadier
,
"
said
Captain
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
my
best
to
maintain
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
last
battery
must
be
near
the
windmill
in
the
Lancaster
avenue
,
"
said
the
brigadier
;
"
and
I
will
confide
it
to
my
kinsman
,
Colonel
Mackintosh
,
and
his
men
.
<EOS>
""I'll
<EOS>
take
it
,
"
replied
the
colonel
;
"
and
keep
it
—
as
long
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
now
let
us
set
to
work
at
once
,
"
said
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
n't
a
minute
to
lose
.
<EOS>
"Thereupon
they
all
went
forth
,
and
each
person
,
to
whom
the
construction
and
command
of
a
barricade
had
been
committed
,
called
his
men
together
,
and
proceeded
to
the
appointed
spot
.
<EOS>
Such
extraordinary
exertions
were
made
,
and
so
many
hands
employed
,
that
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
intrenchments
were
thrown
up
,
and
strong
barriers
formed
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
Charles
Radclyffe
assisted
in
person
in
the
formation
of
the
Churchgate
barrier
.
<EOS>
Stripping
off
their
coats
they
worked
like
pioneers
,
and
were
greatly
encouraged
by
the
presence
of
the
countess
and
Dorothy
Forster
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
Churchgate
barrier
was
completed
,
two
of
the
ship
guns
brought
from
Lancaster
were
placed
upon
it
and
entrusted
to
the
management
of
Tom
Syddall
and
some
of
his
men
.
<EOS>
While
these
defensive
preparations
were
going
on
,
all
the
houses
in
Church-
street
and
the
Fishergate
were
filled
with
Highlanders
and
dismounted
troopers
,
ready
to
fire
upon
the
enemy
from
window
,
roof
,
and
cellar
.
<EOS>
In
these
two
streets
were
the
best
houses
of
the
town
,
and
here
Brigadier
Mackintosh
anticipated
that
the
chief
attack
would
be
made
.
<EOS>
The
church
,
as
already
mentioned
,
was
surrounded
by
an
extensive
churchyard
,
and
here
—
as
the
most
available
place
for
the
purpose
—
a
strong
force
was
collected
.
<EOS>
On
the
north
side
of
the
edifice
were
posted
the
Lowlanders
and
Northumbrian
gentlemen
—
the
latter
being
now
dismounted
—
under
the
command
of
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
Colonel
Brereton
,
who
had
lately
joined
as
a
volunteer
.
<EOS>
On
the
south
side
were
planted
the
Borderers
,
likewise
dismounted
,
under
the
command
of
Captains
Douglas
and
Hunter
.
<EOS>
In
a
small
street
adjoining
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
house
a
small
barrier
had
been
formed
by
Captain
Wogan
and
his
regiment
.
<EOS>
All
the
reserves
were
posted
in
the
marketplace
,
and
here
were
kept
the
horses
of
the
dismounted
troopers
.
<EOS>
While
the
barriers
were
being
formed
,
General
Forster
,
attended
by
a
small
party
of
men
,
rode
from
point
to
point
to
give
directions
,
which
were
not
always
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Having
finished
his
survey
he
entered
the
town
-
hall
,
where
a
great
number
of
ladies
had
taken
refuge
—
among
whom
was
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
—
and
assured
them
they
had
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
enemy
will
never
be
able
to
penetrate
the
centre
of
the
town
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
fighting
will
take
place
at
the
barricades
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
force
them
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
find
you
are
so
confident
,
"
said
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
I
confess
I
feel
very
uneasy
—
though
I
do
n't
doubt
the
bravery
of
our
troops
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
preparations
are
so
well
made
that
we
are
quite
unassailable
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
The
barriers
will
never
be
passed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Derwentwater
and
my
sister
entertain
so
little
apprehension
of
the
result
of
the
attack
that
they
do
not
mean
to
quit
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
house
,
but
will
station
themselves
on
the
roof
to
witness
the
attack
on
the
battery
.
<EOS>
""I
begin
to
think
I
should
like
to
see
the
commencement
of
the
attack
,
"
remarked
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
very
curious
sight
.
<EOS>
And
since
you
say
there
is
no
danger?""I
do
n't
say
so
,
"
interrupted
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
there
is
very
great
danger
.
<EOS>
Stay
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
You
are
quite
safe
here
.
<EOS>
""No
,
I
will
go
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
My
curiosity
is
aroused
.
<EOS>
You
shall
take
me
to
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
house
.
<EOS>
""Don't
ask
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
lady
,
however
,
being
determined
,
he
was
obliged
to
comply
.
<EOS>
Ordering
a
trooper
to
follow
him
with
his
horse
,
he
conducted
her
to
Church-
street
,
which
was
now
full
of
soldiers
,
and
left
her
at
the
entrance
to
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
allow
him
to
go
further
,
saying
,
she
could
easily
find
her
way
to
the
roof
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIWhat
<EOS>
the
Countess
and
Dorothy
beheld
from
the
summit
of
the
MansionNO
position
in
the
town
,
except
,
perhaps
,
the
tower
of
the
church
,
commanded
so
good
a
view
of
the
proceedings
as
was
obtained
from
the
summit
of
this
lofty
mansion
.
<EOS>
Part
of
the
roof
was
flat
,
and
protected
by
a
balustrade
,
and
it
was
here
that
the
countess
and
Dorothy
Forster
were
stationed
.
<EOS>
They
had
come
there
,
after
witnessing
the
completion
of
the
barricade
at
which
the
earl
had
assisted
,
and
contemplated
the
scene
with
extraordinary
interest
.
<EOS>
From
this
spot
they
could
clearly
distinguish
the
movements
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
saw
General
Wills
issue
from
the
Wigan
lane
with
his
infantry
and
cavalry
,
and
draw
up
in
the
fields
to
survey
the
town
,
and
they
could
not
help
contrasting
the
appearance
of
the
king
's
soldiers
with
that
of
their
own
undisciplined
troops
.
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
they
saw
two
brigades
of
horse
and
dragoons
move
off
towards
the
other
side
of
the
town
,
and
though
these
troops
soon
disappeared
,
the
object
of
the
movement
was
clear
.
<EOS>
An
attack
was
about
to
be
made
on
the
Lancaster
avenue
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
it
be
doubted
that
a
simultaneous
attack
would
be
made
on
the
south
by
the
forces
left
behind
.
<EOS>
This
conviction
sent
a
thrill
of
terror
through
the
breasts
of
the
two
lookers-
on
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
reassured
when
they
perceived
that
both
streets
were
now
very
strongly
guarded
—
that
the
trenches
were
completed
and
cannon
mounted
on
the
barricades
—
<EOS>
that
not
only
were
troops
thickly
planted
at
the
barriers
,
but
the
roofs
and
windows
of
all
the
houses
were
occupied
by
Highlanders
and
other
soldiers
—
that
the
churchyard
,
which
was
almost
opposite
them
,
was
full
of
troops
—
showing
that
if
the
enemy
was
ready
to
make
the
attack
,
their
friends
were
prepared
for
a
gallant
defence
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
all
.
<EOS>
Looking
towards
the
Broadway
at
the
back
of
the
garden
,
they
could
descry
the
barricade
commanded
by
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
and
saw
that
it
was
guarded
by
a
large
party
of
Highlanders
,
while
the
advanced
guard
of
Northumbrian
gentlemen
,
commanded
by
Captain
Wogan
,
could
likewise
be
seen
posted
at
the
end
of
a
narrow
street
at
the
left
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
all
the
approaches
,
so
far
as
discernible
,
seemed
well
protected
.
<EOS>
The
access
to
the
market
-
place
from
Church
-
street
was
blocked
up
by
cavalry
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
they
entertain
any
doubt
that
the
preparations
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
were
equally
efficient
.
<EOS>
They
felt
sure
that
the
Lancaster
avenue
would
be
well
guarded
by
Colonel
Mackintosh
and
the
Clan
Chattan
.
<EOS>
The
spectacle
thus
presented
to
their
gaze
dispelled
any
misgivings
,
and
filled
them
with
ardour
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
Lord
Derwentwater
appeared
on
the
roof
,
attended
by
Father
Norman
and
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
"You
must
quit
this
place
immediately
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
attack
is
about
to
commence
.
<EOS>
Father
Norman
and
Newbiggin
will
take
you
to
the
town
-
hall
,
where
you
will
be
safe
.
<EOS>
""We
shall
see
nothing
at
the
town
-
hall
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
we
are
in
the
least
danger
here
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
remain
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
The
lower
part
of
the
house
is
occupied
by
Captain
Innes
with
a
party
of
Highlanders
,
and
when
the
attack
commences
,
some
of
them
will
come
to
the
roof
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
us
stay
till
then
,
"
entreated
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
see
the
commencement
of
the
attack
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
stir
from
the
post
at
present
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
never
forgive
myself
if
any
disaster
occurs
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
ought
not
to
have
consented
to
your
remaining
here
so
long
.
<EOS>
Why
did
you
not
yield
to
my
entreaties
?
<EOS>
Had
you
set
out
yesterday
,
you
would
now
be
far
on
the
road
to
Dilston
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
must
blame
me
more
than
the
countess
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
I
besought
her
to
stay
,
and
she
yielded
to
my
request
.
<EOS>
""Commit
<EOS>
no
further
errors
,
"
said
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quit
this
dangerous
position
immediately
,
and
repair
to
the
town
-
hall
as
suggested
by
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
""Must
<EOS>
we
really
go
?
"
said
the
countess
,
with
an
appealing
look
to
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Do
let
us
stay
for
a
few
minutes
<EOS>
longer!""Well
,
I
consent
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
only
on
the
condition
that
you
depart
when
Father
Norman
deems
it
prudent
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I

your
care
,
father
.
<EOS>
""Be
<EOS>
sure
I
will
watch
over
them
,
my
son
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"Newbiggin
,
I
need
not
give
any
commands
to
you
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
attend
to
your
lady
and
Miss
Forster
.
<EOS>
""With
my
life
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
butler
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
earl
taken
his
departure
than
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
made
her
appearance
on
the
roof
,
and
took
up
her
station
by
the
other
ladies
.
<EOS>
"I
am
just
in
time
,
"
she
said
,
after
greetings
had
passed
between
them
.
"
<EOS>
General
Forster
says
there
is
no
danger
here
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
not
,
"
replied
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
shall
not
remain
here
long
.
<EOS>
"Meantime
<EOS>
,
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
had
proceeded
to
the
adjacent
barrier
,
and
taken
up
a
position
with
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
who
had
likewise
been
joined
by
Lord
Kenmure
and
the
Earls
of
Wintoun
and
Nithsdale
.

CHAPTER
IIIThe
Commencement
of
the
AssaultA
STRANGE
and
portentous
quietude
now
prevailed
,
like
the
awful
hush
preceding
a
storm
.
<EOS>
All
the
insurgent
troops
were
in
position
,
and
in
momentary
expectation
of
the
attack
.
<EOS>
The
barricades
were
manned
,
the
houses
occupied
with
soldiers
as
we
have
mentioned
,
and
the
churchyard
filled
with
troops
.
<EOS>
But
not
a
sound
proceeded
from
this
vast
collection
of
men
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
Preston
beheld
such
a
sight
.
<EOS>
Except
in
the
market
-
place
,
all
business
was
suspended
throughout
the
town
,
but
here
the
houses
were
open
,
and
the
Mitre
and
the
Bull
were
thronged
.
<EOS>
Terrified
to
death
at
the
thought
of
the
approaching
conflict
,
almost
all
the
residents
in
Church
-
street
and
Fishergate
had
quitted
their
houses
,
and
repaired
to
the
centre
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
thing
in
Friargate
,
and
in
many
houses
in
the
Lancaster
avenue
.
<EOS>
Thus
in
fear
and
trembling
did
the
inhabitants
of
Preston
await
the
commencement
of
the
assault
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
murmur
arose
from
those
stationed
on
the
roofs
of
houses
,
and
everywhere
were
heard
the
words
,
"
They
come
.
<EOS>
"Then
the
countess
and
Dorothy
,
with
hundreds
of
others
who
were
gazing
eagerly
towards
the
Wigan
avenue
,
beheld
a
body
of
red
-
coated
foot
soldiers
issue
from
the
lane
,
and
march
towards
the
street
.
<EOS>
These
were
Preston
's
foot
.
<EOS>
Captain
Preston
was
with
them
himself
,
but
on
this
occasion
the
regiment
was
commanded
by
Lord
Forrester
,
who
rode
at
their
head
.
<EOS>
The
men
looked
very
well
,
and
presented
a
very
gallant
appearance
.
<EOS>
They
were
supported
by
two
hundred
and
fifty
dragoons
,
selected
from
five
different
regiments
,
each
party
being
commanded
by
a
captain
,
and
the
whole
being
commanded
by
Major
Bland
and
Major
Lawson
.
<EOS>
Then
came
two
regiments
of
dragoons
under
the
command
of
Brigadier
Honeywood
.
<EOS>
Casting
a
rapid
glance
along
the
street
,
Lord
Forrester
instantly
saw
how
matters
stood
,
but
ordered
his
men
to
attack
the
barricade
,
which
presented
a
very
formidable
appearance
with
the
cannon
mounted
upon
it
,
and
the
troops
collected
behind
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
assailants
had
not
advanced
far
,
when
such
a
terrible
fire
was
poured
upon
them
from
the
barricade
,
and
from
the
roofs
and
windows
of
the
houses
,
that
they
halted
.
<EOS>
By
this
deadly
discharge
nearly
fifty
men
were
killed
,
or
severely
wounded
.
<EOS>
Loud
shouts
arose
from
the
defenders
of
the
barricade
,
and
stifled
the
groans
of
the
wounded
.
<EOS>
The
fire
of
the
defenders
was
instantly
returned
by
the
assailants
,
but
with
comparatively
little
effect
.
<EOS>
Urged
on
by
Lord
Forrester
and
Captain
Preston
the
assailants
marched
on
,
but
were
checked
by
a
second
discharge
quite
as
terrible
as
the
first
,
while
the
cannon
being
well
directed
by
Tom
Syddall
and
his
men
,
did
great
execution
.
<EOS>
Thus
much
did
the
countess
and
Dorothy
see
,
but
they
beheld
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
spectacle
of
that
street
,
filled
with
dying
and
dead
,
was
too
much
for
them
,
and
they
covered
their
eyes
to
shut
out
the
dreadful
sight
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
I
take
you
hence
?
"
said
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
—
yes
!
"
cried
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Casting
one
look
at
the
barricade
,
and
seeing
that
the
earl
was
safe
,
she
instantly
quitted
the
roof
with
the
priest
and
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
The
other
ladies
followed
.
<EOS>
The
party
did
not
venture
into
the
street
,
but
made
their
way
through
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
speeding
along
,
another
discharge
of
musketry
took
place
,
accompanied
by
the
roar
of
the
cannon
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
distant
firing
was
heard
on
the
north
side
of
the
town
,
showing
that
the
attack
had
likewise
begun
in
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
A
sergeant
,
despatched
by
Captain
Innes
,
made
way
for
them
through
the
crowded
street
to
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
they
reached
the
town
-
hall
than
the
countess
and
Dorothy
withdrew
to
a
private
room
,
with
the
priest
,
and
spent
some
time
in
earnest
devotions
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVAltercation
between
Forster
and
MackintoshFINDING
it
impossible
to
force
his
men
to
attack
the
barricade
in
the
face
of
this
incessant
fire
<EOS>
,
Lord
Forrester
did
not
attempt
any
further
advance
for
the
present
,
but
retiring
to
the
end
of
the
street
,
where
he
was
sustained
by
the
dismounted
dragoons
and
Honeywood
's
regiment
,
directed
Captain
Preston
to
lead
a
party
of
men
through
a
narrow
passage
which
he
had
observed
to
the
back
of
the
street
,
and
,
if
possible
,
get
possession
of
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
House
.
<EOS>
Captain
Preston
at
once
obeyed
the
order
,
but
on
reaching
a
thoroughfare
,
called
the
Broadway
,
at
the
back
of
the
houses
<EOS>
,
he
found
his
advance
checked
by
the
small
barrier
commanded
by
Captain
Wogan
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
unhesitatingly
attacked
it
,
but
was
repulsed
.
<EOS>
While
heading
a
second
assault
he
was
struck
down
by
a
shot
,
and
would
have
instantly
been
cut
to
pieces
if
Captain
Wogan
,
at
the
hazard
of
his
own
life
,
had
not
dashed
to
his
assistance
,
and
saved
him
from
the
swords
raised
against
him
.
<EOS>
Having
succeeded
in
bringing
off
his
wounded
foe
,
the
generous
Wogan
consigned
him
to
the
care
of
a
surgeon
.
<EOS>
But
all
aid
was
unavailing
.
<EOS>
Preston
,
than
whom
there
was
not
a
better
or
a
braver
officer
in
the
king
's
service
,
was
dead
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
General
Forster
had
taken
no
part
in
the
defence
,
but
during
a
cessation
of
firing
he
rode
up
to
the
Churchgate
battery
,
and
called
out
to
Mackintosh
in
a
loud
authoritative
tone:"Brigadier
!
<EOS>
sally
out
at
once
with
your
Highlanders
upon
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""Na
,
na
,
general
,
"
replied
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
Were
I
to
part
my
foot
from
the
horse
,
they
might
be
cut
off
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
see
why
that
should
be
,
"
rejoined
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
are
afraid
of
the
foot
,
sally
out
with
the
horse
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
obey
you
,
general
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
;
"
and
for
this
reason
.
<EOS>
In
sallying
out
,
as
you
suggest
,
the
cavalry
wad
have
to
pass
through
the
fire
of
our
ain
foot
to
their
great
detriment
;
and
if
they
failed
in
the
attempt
,
they
would
be
unable
to
retreat
,
and
thus
the
Highlanders
would
be
pent
up
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
see
the
reason
,
"
cried
Forster
,
angrily
;
"
but
I
perceive
you
are
resolved
not
to
obey
me
.
<EOS>
""I
wo
n't
sacrifice
my
men
,
general
,
"
rejoined
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
you
will
take
the
consequences
,
sir
,
"
said
Forster
;
"
for
,
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
if
I
survive
this
day
,
and
the
king
comes
to
his
own
,
I
'll
have
you
tried
by
a
court
-
martial
.
<EOS>
"Mackintosh
<EOS>
shrugged
his
shoulders
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
Just
then
the
firing
recommenced
,
and
Forster
withdrew
to
vent
his
anger
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Learning
that
Mackintosh
had
stationed
Captain
Innes
with
a
party
of
Highlanders
in
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
house
,
he
immediately
removed
them
,
without
alleging
any
reason
for
the
step
,
and
ordered
Captain
Maclean
,
with
a
company
of
gentlemen
volunteers
,
to
take
the
post
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VHow
the
two
large
Houses
in
Church
-
street
were
taken
by
the
AssailantsDURING
Forster
's
altercation
with
the
brigadier
,
Lord
Derwentwater
proceeded
to
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
no
fears
respecting
the
countess
and
Dorothy
,
for
he
knew
they
had
reached
the
town
-
hall
in
safety
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
he
entered
the
churchyard
,
when
he
perceived
Captain
Gordon
,
and
calling
him
<EOS>
,
said:"You
are
the
very
man
I
want
.
<EOS>
Go
instantly
to
the
top
of
the
church
-
tower
,
and
let
me
know
the
movements
of
the
enemy
.
"Captain
<EOS>
Gordon
obeyed
,
and
as
soon
as
he
reached
this
exalted
position
he
looked
carefully
around
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
mentioned
that
the
tower
in
question
was
singularly
low
,
but
from
its
position
it
commanded
an
entire
view
of
the
operations
.
<EOS>
From
this
post
of
observation
Captain
Gordon
could
see
Brigadier
Honeywood
with
his
regiment
of
dragoons
stationed
at
the
end
of
the
street
,
but
he
did
not
concern
himself
with
them
,
his
attention
being
particularly
attracted
to
the
movements
of
Major
Bland
,
with
a
large
party
of
dismounted
dragoons
,
attacking
the
battery
commanded
by
Lord
Charles
Murray
.
<EOS>
Lord
Charles
was
defending
himself
vigorously
and
successfully
,
when
another
party
was
seen
approaching
to
attack
him
in
the
flank
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
Captain
Gordon
gave
a
signal
to
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
who
immediately
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
of
his
gentlemen
and
hastened
to
Lord
Charles
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
appearing
in
the
back
lane
,
and
flanking
the
enemy
with
a
close
fire
,
the
earl
quickly
put
them
to
confusion
and
flight
.
<EOS>
But
,
while
retreating
,
the
dragoons
burst
open
the
door
at
the
back
of
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
garden
,
drove
out
Captain
Maclean
and
the
volunteers
placed
there
by
General
Forster
,
and
took
possession
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
same
time
,
the
large
house
belonging
to
Mr.
Eyre
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
which
had
served
as
General
Forster
's
headquarters
,
fell
into
the
hands
of
Brigadier
Honeywood
.
<EOS>
On
observing
this
,
Captain
Gordon
immediately
descended
from
the
church-
tower
,
and
sought
out
General
Forster
,
whom
he
found
near
the
entrance
to
the
market-
place
,
and
told
him
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
the
possession
of
these
two
houses
,
general
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
enemy
have
secured
most
commanding
positions
,
which
will
not
only
afford
them
shelter
from
our
fire
,
but
enable
them
to
do
us
great
damage
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
retaken
at
any
cost
,
but
I
would
recommend
as
the
shortest
way
that
both
houses
be
demolished
by
our
cannon
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
consent
to
their
destruction
,
sir
,
"
replied
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
The
body
of
the
town
is
the
security
of
the
army
.
<EOS>
We
must
dislodge
the
enemy
—
not
destroy
the
houses
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
do
you
not
perceive
,
general
,
that
by
this
course
you
are
affording
security
to
the
besiegers
,
"
said
Captain
Gordon
.
<EOS>
"
Reinforcements
are
sure
to
arrive
,
and
then
we
shall
never
be
able
to
drive
out
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""At
<EOS>
all
events
,
the
attempt
shall
be
made
before
I
have
recourse
to
cannon
,
"
rejoined
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
Let
both
houses
be
attacked
in
front
and
rear
—
but
mind
!
<EOS>
cannon
must
not
be
used
.
<EOS>
"Scarcely
able
to
control
his
anger
,
Captain
Gordon
went
away
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
,
he
found
that
a
vigorous
attempt
was
being
made
by
Lord
Derwentwater
to
dislodge
the
enemy
from
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
house
,
and
a
sharp
conflict
was
then
going
on
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
An
attempt
was
likewise
being
made
to
recover
Mr.
Eyre
's
house
by
a
large
party
of
dismounted
troopers
headed
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Captain
Shaftoe
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
would
have
quickly
knocked
down
both
these
houses
,
but
on
learning
that
General
Forster
had
positively
prohibited
the
use
of
cannon
,
he
desisted
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIHouses
burnt
by
the
AssailantsWITH
the
exception
of
the
loss
sustained
by
the
capture
of
these
two
important
houses
,
and
which
had
been
entirely
caused
by
Forster
's
gross
mismanagement
,
the
insurgents
had
not
only
held
their
own
,
but
obtained
decided
advantages
over
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
three
batteries
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
,
though
all
had
been
repeatedly
and
vigorously
attacked
,
had
been
taken
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
in
every
instance
,
the
assailants
had
been
repulsed
,
and
with
great
loss
.
<EOS>
Neither
by
stratagem
,
nor
direct
assault
,
had
any
portion
of
the
king
's
forces
been
able
to
penetrate
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
All
the
damage
they
had
done
was
at
the
outskirts
.
<EOS>
The
church
,
which
constituted
the
most
important
position
on
the
south
,
was
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
insurgents
,
and
so
trifling
had
been
the
loss
sustained
by
them
,
that
it
had
not
been
necessary
,
as
yet
,
to
call
upon
the
reserves
stationed
in
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
brunt
of
the
fight
had
been
borne
by
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
who
had
planned
the
able
defence
of
the
town
,
and
had
stood
as
firm
as
a
rock
beside
the
barrier
he
had
reared
,
but
a
most
courageous
defence
of
the
Fishergate
barrier
was
made
by
Captain
Douglas
and
Captain
Hunter
,
and
their
moss
-
troopers
and
Borderers
.
<EOS>
Individual
acts
of
valour
were
performed
by
these
hardy
fellows
worthy
of
another
age
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
firing
upon
the
assailants
from
roof
and
window
,
they
occasionally
sallied
forth
,
and
then
some
most
desperate
encounters
took
place
between
them
and
Colonel
Pitt
's
dismounted
dragoons
.
<EOS>
Captain
Douglas
,
who
was
a
very
powerful
man
,
killed
three
dragoons
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
In
another
sally
Captain
Hunter
and
half
a
dozen
men
with
him
advanced
too
far
,
and
being
completely
surrounded
,
must
have
been
captured
,
or
slain
,
had
they
not
been
rescued
at
great
personal
risk
by
Captain
Douglas
.
<EOS>
Some
barns
and
small
habitations
,
at
the
end
of
the
Fishergate
avenue
,
occupied
by
the
moss
-
troopers
,
were
set
fire
to
and
burnt
by
Pitt
's
men
,
but
no
real
damage
was
done
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
several
much
larger
houses
were
set
on
fire
at
the
end
of
Church
-
street
by
order
of
Brigadier
Honeywood
,
so
as
to
drive
out
the
Highlanders
who
occupied
them
,
and
compel
them
to
take
refuge
in
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
the
wind
being
in
the
north
at
the
time
,
the
conflagration
did
not
spread
far
.
<EOS>
Had
it
blown
from
the
opposite
quarter
,
and
the
wind
been
strong
,
the
whole
town
would
probably
have
been
destroyed
.
<EOS>
No
efforts
being
made
to
extinguish
the
fires
,
the
houses
continued
burning
for
several
hours
,
and
long
after
it
became
dark
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIThe
Windmill
BarricadeWE
must
now
repair
to
the
Windmill
barricade
,
situated
at
the
end
of
the
Lancaster
road
,
and
commanded
by
Colonel
Mackintosh
,
kinsman
of
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Dormer
with
three
hundred
dismounted
dragoons
attempted
to
approach
this
barricade
by
a
narrow
street
or
lane
called
the
Back
Wynd
,
but
they
were
thwarted
in
their
design
by
the
vigilant
Highlanders
,
who
screened
by
garden
walls
,
hedges
,
and
ditches
,
killed
nearly
half
their
number
,
and
forced
the
rest
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
A
direct
attack
was
then
made
on
the
barricade
,
but
with
no
better
success
.
<EOS>
The
Mackintoshes
proved
themselves
splendid
marksmen
.
<EOS>
After
a
third
ineffectual
attack
by
a
back
road
,
during
which
he
again
sustained
considerable
loss
,
Brigadier
Dormer
ordered
Sergeant
Johnstone
and
Corporal
Marlow
,
with
a
score
of
Stanhope
's
dragoons
,
to
set
on
fire
all
the
houses
and
outbuildings
.
<EOS>
While
seeing
the
order
executed
Brigadier
Dormer
was
shot
in
the
leg
,
the
sergeant
and
corporal
were
killed
,
and
some
of
the
men
wounded
,
but
the
work
of
destruction
proceeded
—
and
the
houses
and
cottages
were
burnt
close
up
to
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
was
gained
.
<EOS>
The
valiant
Highland
chief
and
his
clansmen
laughed
at
the
futile
attempts
to
drive
them
from
their
post
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
taken
a
survey
of
the
defences
of
the
town
,
it
will
be
seen
that
they
were
all
intact
,
and
able
to
hold
out
.
<EOS>
But
the
besiegers
were
under
the
impression
that
the
insurgents
would
attempt
to
cut
their
way
out
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
Lancaster
avenue
was
very
strongly
guarded
.
<EOS>
An
express
had
been
sent
by
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
to
General
Carpenter
,
who
had
reached
Clitheroe
,
to
inform
him
that
hostilities
had
commenced
,
and
it
was
therefore
certain
he
would
arrive
next
day
.
<EOS>
Should
this
news
reach
the
rebels
,
it
would
quicken
their
desire
to
escape
,
and
it
behoved
the
besiegers
to
be
doubly
vigilant
—
especially
on
the
north
side
of
the
town
,
where
the
exit
was
most
likely
to
be
made
.
<EOS>
Several
hundreds
of
the
king
's
troops
,
as
we
have
stated
,
had
been
shot
down
in
the
ineffectual
attacks
on
the
barriers
.
<EOS>
Among
the
wounded
were
Major
Bland
and
Major
Lawson
,
and
,
as
we
have
just
mentioned
,
Brigadier
Dormer
was
slightly
hurt
.
<EOS>
Captain
Preston
expired
as
he
was
being
conveyed
to
the
White
Bull
,
where
all
the
wounded
insurgents
were
taken
.
<EOS>
At
this
place
died
Colonel
Brereton
,
Mr.
Clifton
,
and
two
or
three
others
whose
names
are
not
recorded
.
<EOS>
When
Captain
Peter
Farquharson
,
of
Rochaley
,
whose
leg
had
been
badly
shattered
by
a
bullet
,
was
brought
in
by
half
a
dozen
Highlanders
,
and
laid
down
on
a
bench
,
he
called
for
brandy
for
the
men
,
and
taking
a
glass
himself
,
said:"Come
,
lads
<EOS>
,
here
's
to
our
master
's
health
!
<EOS>
I
can
fight
no
longer
,
but
I
wish
you
success
.
<EOS>
"With
mingled
feelings
was
the
health
drunk
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
this
gallant
officer
died
under
the
operation
,
which
was
unskilfully
performed
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIIHow
<EOS>
the
two
large
Houses
were
illuminatedUNTIL
<EOS>
it
grew
dark
,
platoon
-
firing
constantly
took
place
from
the
two
large
houses
captured
by
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
When
night
came
on
,
the
firing
of
course
ceased
,
though
even
then
occasional
shots
were
heard
.
<EOS>
At
all
the
barriers
the
men
rested
on
their
arms
,
the
strictest
watch
being
kept
to
prevent
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
churchyard
was
still
filled
with
troops
.
<EOS>
A
strange
and
terrible
light
was
afforded
by
the
still
burning
houses
,
and
as
these
fires
were
not
confined
to
one
quarter
,
but
could
be
seen
at
different
points
,
it
appeared
as
if
the
whole
town
was
burning
.
<EOS>
The
red
reflection
of
the
fire
in
the
adjacent
street
on
the
tower
and
windows
of
the
church
produced
a
very
striking
effect
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
,
Brigadier
Honeywood
caused
the
windows
of
the
two
large
mansions
,
just
mentioned
,
to
be
brilliantly
lighted
up
,
and
the
illumination
revealed
every
person
in
the
street
,
and
exposed
them
to
the
musketeers
;
but
he
soon
found
this
told
against
himself
,
for
the
marksmen
were
quickly
discovered
and
driven
from
their
position
,
while
the
windows
were
broken
by
showers
of
bullets
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
a
council
of
war
was
held
at
the
Mitre
,
but
nothing
was
determined
upon
,
except
that
a
vigilant
watch
should
be
kept
throughout
the
night
,
and
a
determined
defence
maintained
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
took
very
little
part
in
the
discussion
,
and
complained
bitterly
that
Brigadier
Mackintosh
had
disobeyed
his
orders
.
<EOS>
"I
suppose
it
was
through
my
fault
,
general
,
that
the
two
large
houses
in
Church
-
street
were
lost
?
"
remarked
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"Undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Forster
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
then
,
I
'll
repair
my
fault
,
"
said
Mackintosh
;
"
for
as
I
'm
a
living
man
,
I
'll
demolish
them
baith
,
or
burn
them
to
the
ground
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
defiance
of
my
orders
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Forster
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
defiance
of
anybody
's
orders
,
"
rejoined
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
have
no
disputes
,
I
pray
,
"
interposed
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
""So
confident
am
I
of
success
,
"
said
Mackintosh
,
"
that
I
am
about
to
write
to
the
Earl
of
Mar
that
I
expect
to
gain
a
victory
over
General
Wills
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
A
battle
is
imminent
between
his
lordship
and
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
and
may
possibly
take
place
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
and
success
should
attend
our
arms
both
at
Stirling
and
Preston
,
the
Jacobite
cause
must
be
triumphant
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
grant
it
may
!
<EOS>
"
cried
several
voices
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
further
discourse
,
the
council
broke
up
,
some
proceeding
to
an
adjoining
room
where
supper
was
laid
out
,
and
others
returning
to
their
posts
.
<EOS>
Only
three
persons
were
left
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
These
were
Lord
Derwentwater
,
General
Forster
,
and
Captain
Douglas
.
<EOS>
The
earl
had
told
the
others
that
he
wished
to
confer
with
them
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
trust
all
will
go
well
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
said
;
"
indeed
,
I
do
not
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
Still
I
feel
the
greatest
anxiety
respecting
the
countess
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
wonder
at
it
,
my
lord
,
"
remarked
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
just
as
anxious
about
my
sister
.
<EOS>
Would
we
could
get
them
both
safely
out
of
the
town
—
but
I
fear
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
now
,
since
all
the
avenues
are
guarded
.
<EOS>
""I
will
insure
their
escape
from
the
Fishergate
barrier
,
of
which
I
have
the
command
,
"
said
Captain
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
attempt
must
not
be
made
before
midnight
.
<EOS>
By
crossing
the
ford
,
they
will
be
able
to
gain
the
Liverpool
road
.
<EOS>
Will
the
ladies
be
alone?""They
will
be
attended
by
my
chaplain
,
Father
Norman
,
and
my
butler
,
Newbiggin
,
"
replied
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
send
my
grooms
with
them
,
unless
General
Forster
desires
it
.
<EOS>
""No
,
no
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fewer
the
better
.
<EOS>
""Of
course
,
the
party
will
be
on
horseback
?
"
said
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
conduct
them
to
the
ford
—
but
there
I
must
leave
them
.
<EOS>
""That
will
suffice
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
shall
be
eternally
obliged
to
you
for
the
service
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
so
shall
I
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
midnight
,
then
,
I
should
be
fully
prepared
,
"
said
Douglas
.
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
and
Forster
joined
the
others
at
supper
in
the
next
room
,
while
Lord
Derwentwater
proceeded
to
the
town
-
hall
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
informed
of
the
arrangements
made
for
their
flight
,
the
countess
and
Dorothy
seemed
dissatisfied
rather
than
pleased
,
but
the
earl
was
quite
resolved
upon
their
departure
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
no
telling
what
the
morrow
may
bring
forth
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
if
fortune
should
prove
adverse
,
I
should
bitterly
reproach
myself
for
allowing
you
to
remain
.
<EOS>
Go
you
must
.
<EOS>
"All
arrangements
having
been
made
,
Dorothy
retired
,
and
the
earl
and
countess
were
left
alone
together
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
they
both
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
The
earl
then
spoke:"I
hope
we
may
meet
again
at
Dilston
as
in
former
days
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
great
misgivings
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
will
decide
.
<EOS>
We
shall
then
either
be
victorious
,
or
utterly
defeated
,
and
prisoners
,
for
we
are
shut
up
in
this
town
.
<EOS>
In
the
latter
event
I
well
know
what
my
fate
will
be
,
and
I
confess
that
I
can
not
shake
off
a
dread
presentiment
that
it
will
happen
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
thus
be
despondent
,
my
dear
lord
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
me
everything
seems
to
look
well
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
one
great
danger
.
<EOS>
Should
General
Carpenter
arrive
before
we
have
beaten
Wills
,
we
are
lost
.
<EOS>
Had
a
victory
been
gained
to-
day
—
as
it
might
and
would
have
been
had
<EOS>
we
not
been
thwarted
by
Forster
—
all
would
have
been
well
.
<EOS>
But
now
we
must
trust
to
chance
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
Forster
has
betrayed
us
,
but
he
has
been
excessively
indiscreet
in
confiding
his
secrets
to
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
think
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
has
given
secret
intelligence
to
the
enemy?""I
am
almost
sure
of
it
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
But
let
us
not
trouble
our
parting
with
gloomy
anticipations
.
<EOS>
"They
then
endeavoured
to
talk
cheerfully
,
but
the
effort
was
in
vain
,
and
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
both
of
them
when
Father
Norman
entered
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
heard
from
Dorothy
of
their
proposed
flight
,
and
came
to
inquire
further
about
it
.
"Has
<EOS>
your
lordship
any
instructions
to
give
me
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"None
whatever
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
ever
watch
over
the
countess
during
my
absence
—
and
if
aught
happens
,
console
her
.
<EOS>
""I
will
teach
her
how
to
bear
her
affliction
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perchance
this
may
be
your
last
interview
,
"
he
added
,
looking
steadily
at
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
aught
to
communicate
to
your
husband?""We
have
never
had
any
secrets
from
each
other
,
good
father
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
,
sweetheart?"The
countess
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
A
slight
pause
ensued
,
after
which
the
earl
said:"Am
<EOS>
I
to
understand
you
have
a
secret
from
me?"Another
pause
ensued
,
which
was
broken
by
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Tell
him
all
,
father
<EOS>
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
cannot
.
<EOS>
""What
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
earl
,
astonished
,
and
looking
at
the
priest
for
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
to
tell
me?""Speak
!
<EOS>
daughter
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Father
Norman
,
imperiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
secret
must
be
told,""Keep
me
not
in
suspense
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
earl
,
looking
at
her
.
<EOS>
"You
will
think
me
very
deceitful
when
I
tell
you
that
my
heart
was
not
wholly
yours
when
I
wedded
you
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
wholly
mine
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
fury
.
<EOS>
"
Who
then
was
my
rival?""The
prince
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"The
prince
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
with
a
sudden
burst
of
rage
.
"
<EOS>
Since
he
was
capable
of
this
perfidy
,
I
renounce
him
—
I
throw
off
my
allegiance
—
I
will
break
the
sword
I
have
borne
for
him—""Hear
me
,
my
lord
,
"
she
cried
,
clinging
to
him
.
<EOS>
"Away
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
casting
her
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
How
fondly
I
have
loved
you
,
you
well
know
,
but
now
you
are
hateful
to
me
.
<EOS>
Never
let
me
behold
you
<EOS>
more!""Hold
!
<EOS>
my
lord
,
"
interposed
Father
Norman
,
in
a
tone
of
authority
which
the
earl
could
not
resist
.
<EOS>
"
There
must
be
no
misunderstanding
between
you
and
the
countess
.
<EOS>
By
my
counsel
she
has
made
this
confession
to
you
,
because
the
secret
has
long
weighed
upon
her
heart
,
and
because
you
may
never
meet
again
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
The
love
conceived
by
the
countess
for
the
prince
was
simply
an
ardent
feeling
of
loyalty
,
carried
,
perchance
,
to
excess
;
but
in
no
way
culpable
.
<EOS>
If
the
prince
's
image
was
placed
above
your
own
in
her
breast
,
you
need
feel
no
jealousy
.
<EOS>
Nor
can
the
prince
be
blamed
,
for
word
of
love
never
passed
his
lips
—
nor
was
he
aware
of
the
passion
he
inspired
.
<EOS>
""Is
this
<EOS>
so
?
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"It
is
so
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
have
told
you
all
this
long
ago
—
but
hesitated
from
a
silly
fear
,
till
my
heart
had
become
so
burdened
that
I
dared
not
speak
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
felt
that
the
confession
must
not
be
delayed
,
or
it
might
never
be
made
.
<EOS>
Can
you
forgive
me?""Come
to
my
heart
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
straining
her
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IXThe
FordMIDNIGHT
had
come
.
<EOS>
Very
dark
was
the
night
,
and
favourable
to
the
purpose
of
those
who
sought
to
fly
from
the
beleaguered
town
.
<EOS>
The
fires
in
the
burning
houses
were
nearly
extinguished
,
but
the
course
of
the
conflagration
could
still
be
traced
by
a
red
glow
along
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
two
large
houses
,
now
in
the
hands
of
the
king
's
forces
,
were
no
longer
illuminated
,
but
looked
sombre
and
threatening
—
the
approaches
to
them
in
front
and
at
the
rear
being
strongly
guarded
.
<EOS>
The
church
-
tower
could
be
indistinctly
seen
in
the
gloom
,
and
a
close
survey
of
the
churchyard
would
have
shown
that
it
was
filled
with
troops
who
were
resting
on
their
arms
,
to
be
ready
for
action
at
break
of
day
.
<EOS>
The
barrier
in
this
quarter
was
strongly
guarded
by
the
Highlanders
,
many
of
whom
were
lying
on
their
plaids
beside
the
trenches
while
their
comrades
kept
watch
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
town
it
was
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
At
the
Windmill
battery
,
where
Wynn
's
and
Pitt
's
regiments
were
posted
,
so
as
completely
to
block
up
the
Lancaster
road
,
and
prevent
all
chance
of
escape
in
that
direction
,
the
brave
Clan
Chattan
were
gathered
—
most
of
them
lying
on
the
ground
,
but
ready
to
spring
to
their
feet
on
the
slightest
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
barrier
commanded
by
Lord
Charles
Murray
was
likewise
strongly
guarded
,
and
by
a
vigilant
force
—
<EOS>
this
being
a
position
exposed
to
much
peril
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
Fishergate
barricade
,
it
was
better
watched
by
the
defenders
than
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
the
outlet
connected
with
this
battery
,
and
which
led
to
a
lane
communicating
with
a
ford
over
the
Ribble
,
was
not
blocked
up
like
the
other
avenues
.
<EOS>
Three
squadrons
of
horse
belonging
to
Brigadier
Pitt
were
posted
at
intervals
in
the
fields
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
—
Pitt
's
own
quarters
being
fixed
at
a
large
farm
-
house
on
the
rise
of
the
hill
—
but
the
lane
we
have
mentioned
had
been
left
unguarded
.
<EOS>
This
unaccountable
piece
of
negligence
had
been
accidentally
discovered
by
Captain
Douglas
,
while
reconnoitring
the
road
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
had
not
ventured
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
.
<EOS>
Midnight
had
just
tolled
,
and
the
besieged
town
presented
the
appearance
we
have
endeavoured
to
describe
,
when
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
embraced
her
lord
,
and
with
his
aid
mounted
the
steed
that
was
waiting
for
her
outside
the
Fishergate
barrier
.
<EOS>
"Farewell
,
my
best
beloved
!
"
cried
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
it
may
be
for
ever
!
<EOS>
To-
morrow
will
decide
my
fate
.
<EOS>
Should
the
worst
happen
,
be
sure
my
last
thought
will
be
of
you
.
<EOS>
""Farewell
,
my
dearest
lord
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
for
ever
!
<EOS>
for
I
am
certain
we
shall
meet
again!"Dorothy
<EOS>
was
already
on
horseback
,
and
beside
her
was
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
was
resolved
to
see
them
safely
across
the
ford
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
mentioned
that
since
Dorothy
's
arrival
in
Preston
,
Charles
had
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
her
;
but
owing
to
circumstances
,
they
had
been
little
together
,
and
now
they
were
compelled
to
part
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
did
not
despair
of
an
early
meeting
.
<EOS>
In
attendance
on
the
ladies
were
Father
Norman
and
Newbiggin
,
both
of
whom
were
well
mounted
.
<EOS>
As
the
conductor
of
the
party
,
Captain
Douglas
rode
a
little
in
advance
—
but
the
countess
was
not
far
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Almost
instantly
the
party
disappeared
in
the
gloom
,
and
then
the
earl
listened
intently
for
any
sounds
that
might
tell
how
they
got
on
;
but
nothing
to
occasion
alarm
being
heard
,
after
waiting
for
a
few
minutes
<EOS>
,
he
retired
—
though
with
a
sad
heart
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
party
proceeded
in
the
order
described
,
and
in
silence
.
<EOS>
If
a
word
was
exchanged
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Dorothy
,
it
reached
no
other
ears
but
their
own
.
<EOS>
No
interruption
was
offered
as
they
rode
down
the
narrow
lane
,
and
even
a
gate
that
led
to
a
field
skirting
the
river
seemed
left
purposely
open
.
<EOS>
Here
Captain
Douglas
rode
alone
to
reconnoitre
,
but
returned
almost
immediately
to
say
that
the
way
was
clear
.
<EOS>
During
his
brief
absence
,
the
countess
cast
a
look
back
at
the
hill
,
and
could
just
distinguish
the
dark
outline
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
it
could
be
seen
from
the
reflection
that
a
house
was
still
burning
.
<EOS>
As
they
advanced
,
a
slight
glimmer
showed
that
the
river
was
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Before
descending
the
bank
,
Captain
Douglas
took
hold
of
the
countess
's
bridle
,
and
then
led
her
horse
cautiously
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
His
example
was
followed
by
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
the
two
ladies
were
soon
crossing
the
ford
.
<EOS>
Evidently
the
river
was
not
very
deep
at
this
point
,
and
there
seemed
nothing
to
occasion
uneasiness
,
when
the
figure
of
a
man
armed
with
a
musket
could
be
suddenly
descried
on
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
As
will
be
surmised
,
this
was
no
other
than
Parson
Woods
of
Chowbent
,
who
had
undertaken
to
watch
the
ford
.
<EOS>
"Stop
!
"
he
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
you
can
not
pass
here
.
<EOS>
Attempt
to
advance
further
,
and
I
shall
fire
upon
you
.
<EOS>
""Look
to
yourself
,
friend
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Captain
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
Retire
at
once
,
or
I
will
send
a
bullet
through
your
head
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
drawing
a
pistol
he
prepared
to
execute
his
threat
.
<EOS>
"Hold
!
"
said
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
let
us
pass
,
when
he
knows
we
are
ladies
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
said
Parson
Woods
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you?""Make
way
for
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
and
Miss
Forster
,
"
cried
Captain
Douglas
,
thinking
to
overawe
him
.
<EOS>
Precisely
the
contrary
effect
was
produced
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
Parson
Woods
hear
those
important
names
,
than
he
called
to
his
men
who
were
concealed
by
the
bank
behind
him:"Arise
,
and
follow
me
!
<EOS>
Heaven
has
delivered
into
our
hands
the
wife
and
sister
of
the
principal
rebels
!
<EOS>
Come
with
me
,
I
say
,
that
we
may
prevent
the
flight
of
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
and
Miss
Forster
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
dashed
into
the
river
,
followed
by
his
men
,
and
though
Captain
Douglas
fired
at
him
,
he
was
not
harmed
,
but
seized
the
countess
's
bridle
,
and
detained
her
;
while
Dorothy
was
captured
in
like
manner
by
some
of
his
men
,
despite
Charles
Radclyffe
's
resistance
.
<EOS>
What
might
have
ensued
it
is
impossible
to
say
,
since
Captain
Douglas
and
his
companion
were
compelled
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
party
of
Pitt
's
dragoons
.
<EOS>
Father
Norman
and
Newbiggin
offered
no
resistance
,
and
were
captured
with
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XBy
whom
the
Countess
and
Dorothy
were
liberatedTHE
leader
of
the
troop
seemed
an
important
personage
,
since
he
was
treated
with
marked
deference
by
Parson
Woods
.
<EOS>
After
putting
a
few
questions
in
an
undertone
to
the
minister
,
he
turned
to
the
ladies
,
and
said:"Am
I
to
understand
that
I
am
addressing
Lady
Derwentwater
and
Miss
Forster?""You
<EOS>
are
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
are
satisfied
on
the
point
,
I
presume
we
shall
not
be
<EOS>
detained?"The
officer
made
no
direct
reply
,
but
said
rather
bluntly
:
"
Who
are
these
persons
with
you?""One
is
Lord
Derwentwater
's
chaplain
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
other
is
a
private
servant
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
ladyship
must
excuse
me
if
I
appear
inquisitive
,
but
I
am
obliged
to
ask
where
you
are
going
?
"
said
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
must
request
a
precise
answer
to
the
inquiry?""It
is
not
my
habit
to
equivocate
,
sir
,
"
replied
she
.
<EOS>
"
My
destination
is
Dilston
,
and
if
we
are
allowed
to
proceed
,
Miss
Forster
will
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
""I
presume
your
ladyship
thinks
Preston
unsafe
,
or
you
would
not
quit
it
in
this
manner
?
"
<EOS>
remarked
the
officer
.
<EOS>
Lady
Derwentwater
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
"That
question
ought
not
to
have
been
put
,
"
said
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
called
upon
to
explain
the
cause
of
our
departure
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
when
General
Forster
's
sister
flies
,
it
may
be
presumed
that
the
place
is
not
likely
to
hold
out
long
,
"
remarked
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"You
may
draw
any
inference
you
please
,
"
rejoined
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
My
own
opinion
is
that
General
Wills
will
be
driven
away
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
has
certainly
had
the
worst
of
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
his
defeat
,
"
said
the
officer
;
"
for
I
propose
to
send
you
back
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
Parson
Woods
,
"
he
added
to
the
minister
,
"
since
you
have
made
this
important
capture
,
you
shall
conduct
the
ladies
to
the
Fishergate
avenue
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
a
party
of
horse
to
sustain
you
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
require
support
,
general
,
"
said
the
minister
.
<EOS>
"General
!
"
exclaimed
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
<EOS>
we
are
speaking
to
General
Wills?""Has
<EOS>
your
ladyship
only
just
made
that
discovery
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Parson
Woods
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"I
suspected
it
from
the
first
,
"
observed
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"You
can
tell
your
brother
,
the
general
,
that
you
have
had
a
conference
with
me
,
"
said
Wills
;
"
and
that
you
told
me
to
my
face
that
I
should
be
defeated
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
""I
told
you
the
truth
,
general
,
however
disagreeable
it
may
be
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
time
will
show
,
"
rejoined
Wills
;
"
but
I
rather
think
that
before
to-
morrow
night
General
Forster
will
have
surrendered
,
and
in
that
event
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
will
be
given
up
as
a
hostage
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
a
horseman
,
who
proved
to
be
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
,
rode
up
,
having
with
him
a
lady
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
I
have
found
you
,
general
,
"
said
Sir
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
This
lady
has
something
important
to
communicate
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Pray
<EOS>
come
this
way
,
madam
,
"
said
Wills
,
taking
the
lady
aside
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
a
whispered
conversation
took
place
between
them
.
<EOS>
"I
know
that
voice
,
"
observed
the
countess
to
Dorothy
.
"
<EOS>
But
surely
it
can
not
be—""It
is
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
"
was
the
reply
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
thought
she
played
my
brother
false
.
<EOS>
Now
we
have
positive
proof
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
has
come
to
give
information
respecting
the
state
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
"Dorothy
was
quite
right
in
the
conjecture
.
<EOS>
When
the
conference
between
Wills
and
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
was
ended
,
and
the
lady
found
that
the
countess
and
Dorothy
were
close
at
hand
,
she
became
very
uneasy
,
and
begged
General
Wills
to
set
them
free
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
they
go
back
,
I
can
not
,
"
she
observed
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
tell
General
Forster
they
have
seen
me
here
,
and
what
explanation
can
I
give
him?""It
matters
<EOS>
little
now
what
explanation
is
given
,
"
replied
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
shall
not
be
exposed
to
any
annoyance
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Tomorrow
,
you
are
certain
to
have
important
information
to
give
me
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
fail
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
General
Wills
then
called
to
Sir
Henry
,
and
after
consigning
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
to
his
care
turned
to
Parson
Woods
,
who
was
waiting
for
final
orders
,
and
said:"I
have
altered
my
plans
,
parson
.
<EOS>
Take
Lady
Derwentwater
and
Miss
Forster
with
their
attendants
across
the
river
,
and
then
set
them
free
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
,
general
,
"
replied
Woods
,
with
a
military
salute
.
"
<EOS>
Be
pleased
to
follow
me
,
ladies
.
<EOS>
"He
was
not
quite
so
civil
to
Father
Norman
and
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
we
are
not
liberated
at
that
lady
's
request
;
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
willingly
be
under
any
obligation
to
her
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
need
not
be
uneasy
,
"
said
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
under
no
obligation
to
any
one
but
me
.
<EOS>
Goodnight
,
ladies
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
safe
journey
to
Dilston
.
<EOS>
When
I
tell
you
that
General
Carpenter
will
be
here
with
two
thousand
men
to
-
morrow
,
you
may
be
glad
to
be
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
rode
off
,
while
the
ladies
and
their
companions
were
taken
across
the
ford
by

CHAPTER
XIAn
Unlucky
ShotAFTER
their
unsuccessful
attempt
to
cross
the
ford
,
<EOS>
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Captain
Douglas
did
not
return
to
the
town
,
but
concealed
themselves
among
some
trees
till
they
had
ascertained
that
the
countess
and
Dorothy
were
to
be
liberated
.
<EOS>
They
then
went
back
tolerably
well
satisfied
with
the
issue
of
the
adventure
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
riding
slowly
up
the
lane
leading
to
the
Fishergate
avenue
,
they
caught
the
sound
of
horses
'
feet
behind
them
,
and
stopped
to
listen
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
dark
that
nothing
could
be
seen
distinctly
,
but
they
heard
voices
,
and
Captain
Douglas
drew
a
pistol
and
called
out
,
"
Who
goes
there?""A
friend
,
"
replied
a
voice
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
whom
?
"
demanded
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
King
James
,
or
King
George
.
<EOS>
""I
am
no
rebel
,
"
replied
the
person
who
had
spoken
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
seems
you
are
,
and
I
am
therefore
bound
to
make
you
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
useless
to
resist
,
for
I
have
a
dozen
men
with
me
.
<EOS>
""I
would
not
yield
if
you
had
twice
the
number
,
"
rejoined
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
Advance
a
step
further
,
and
I
will
shoot
you
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
him
go
,
Sir
Henry
,
"
cried
a
female
voice
.
"'Tis
<EOS>
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
it
seems
,
"
said
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Sir
Henry
,
"
he
cried
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
for
you
to
yield
—
not
me
.
<EOS>
""This
is
my
answer
,
"
replied
Sir
Henry
,
firing
at
him
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
this
my
rejoinder
,
"
cried
Douglas
,
firing
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
A
shriek
followed
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
have
I
done
?
"
cried
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"Wounded
<EOS>
a
lady
,
"
replied
Sir
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
much
hurt
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Mortally
,
I
fear
,
"
she
replied
,
in
a
faint
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Support
me
,
or
I
shall
fall
from
my
horse
.
""'Tis
<EOS>
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
!
"
cried
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
most
unlucky
accident
.
<EOS>
But
there
must
be
a
truce
between
us
,
"
he
added
,
ordering
back
his
men
,
who
were
preparing
to
advance
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
would
you
have
us
do
?
"
asked
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"Bid
<EOS>
them
take
me
to
the
town
,
"
said
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
not
die
here
.
<EOS>
"She
was
then
placed
on
the
saddle
before
Captain
Douglas
,
who
rode
on
as
fast
as
he
could
under
such
distressing
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Long
ere
he
reached
the
barrier
Douglas
<EOS>
thought
his
burden
felt
inanimate
,
but
when
she
was
lifted
down
,
and
a
light
fell
upon
her
pallid
face
,
it
was
found
she
was
quite
dead

THE
SURRENDERCHAPTER
<EOS>
IHow
<EOS>
a
Party
of
Dragoons
was
routed
by
Captain
GordonAs
soon
as
it
began
to
grow
light
next
morning
,
Captain
Gordon
mounted
the
church
-
tower
to
survey
the
town
.
<EOS>
All
seemed
quiet?besiegers
and
defenders
.
<EOS>
The
Highlanders
were
still
lying
stretched
on
their
plaids
near
the
barricade
;
but
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
,
who
did
not
possess
the
hardihood
of
the
Scots
,
had
quitted
the
churchyard
,
and
sought
shelter
in
sonic
of
the
adjacent
houses
.
<EOS>
No
signs
of
movement
were
visible
in
the
two
large
houses
in
possession
of
the
enemy
;
but
the
sentinels
were
at
their
posts
,
and
no
doubt
the
men
could
be
summoned
instantly
to
arms
.
<EOS>
The
street
presented
a
ghastly
sight
—
the
dead
not
having
been
removed
,
and
the
ground
being
covered
with
blood
.
<EOS>
Turning
from
this
painful
spectacle
he
surveyed
the
fields
outside
the
town
,
but
could
not
perceive
that
any
change
had
been
made
in
the
disposition
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
A
mist
arose
from
the
marshy
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
river
,
and
partially
concealed
the
militia
stationed
near
the
bridge
,
but
the
two
squadrons
of
Pitt
's
dragoons
could
be
distinguished
in
the
fields
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
be
the
design
of
the
enemy
,
it
seemed
to
Captain
Gordon
that
no
immediate
attack
was
intended
.
<EOS>
But
while
he
continued
his
survey
,
and
carefully
reconnoitred
the
outskirts
of
the
town
,
he
perceived
some
dismounted
dragoons
creeping
along
the
Wigan
lane
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
Watching
them
carefully
for
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
it
got
lighter
,
he
found
their
numbers
increase
,
and
became
convinced
that
they
were
the
head
of
a
large
party
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
quickly
descended
from
the
tower
,
and
gave
the
alarm
to
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
whom
he
found
at
his
post
,
and
who
ordered
him
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
Fishergate
barrier
—
the
only
outlet
not
blocked
up
—
and
take
a
troop
of
horse
and
attack
them
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gordon
instantly
obeyed
—
nor
was
he
detained
at
the
barrier
in
question
.
<EOS>
Fifty
stout
Borderers
,
who
were
sleeping
beside
their
steeds
,
bridle
in
hand
,
were
quickly
in
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
A
horse
was
found
for
him
,
and
the
party
sallied
forth
.
<EOS>
The
Wigan
lane
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
,
and
to
reach
it
they
had
to
cross
the
field
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
got
there
just
as
the
dragoons
had
quitted
the
lane
,
but
had
not
formed
,
and
immediately
charged
them
—
throwing
them
into
confusion
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
.
<EOS>
The
conflict
only
lasted
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
ended
in
the
complete
rout
of
the
dragoons
,
several
of
whom
were
killed
,
including
the
captain
.
<EOS>
Very
little
loss
was
sustained
by
the
insurgents
.
<EOS>
Quite
surprised
with
what
he
had
done
,
and
fearing
his
retreat
might
be
cut
off
if
he
attempted
pursuit
,
Captain
Gordon
galloped
back
as
hard
as
he
could
to
the
Fishergate
avenue
.
<EOS>
He
was
only
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
The
encounter
had
been
witnessed
by
the
two
squadrons
of
Pitt
's
dragoons
stationed
near
the
river
,
and
they
both
endeavoured
to
intercept
him
,
but
he
and
the
Borderers
were
safe
behind
the
barriers
before
either
could
come
up
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gordon
gained
great
credit
by
this
achievement
,
which
was
one
of
the
last
performed
by
the
insurgents
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIMeeting
of
Carpenter
and
WillsPREPARATIONS
were
made
by
the
insurgent
leaders
at
all
the
barricades
for
a
renewal
of
hostilities
,
and
Brigadier
Mackintosh
had
just
given
orders
to
Tom
Syddall
to
commence
the
demolition
of
the
two
large
houses
in
Church
-
street
,
when
word
was
brought
that
a
very
large
force
,
consisting
of
more
than
two
thousand
horse
,
could
be
seen
approaching
from
the
north
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
could
be
entertained
that
this
force
belonged
to
General
Carpenter
,
who
must
have
made
an
early
march
from
Clitheroe
in
order
to
effect
a
junction
with
Wills
before
the
attack
was
resumed
.
<EOS>
All
was
now
consternation
among
the
besieged
,
who
felt
that
some
immediate
step
must
be
taken
,
or
they
would
be
shut
in
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Mackintosh
proposed
to
sally
forth
with
his
men
,
and
consulted
the
brigadier
,
who
dissuaded
him
from
the
attempt
,
declaring
it
impracticable
.
<EOS>
As
usual
,
General
Forster
was
completely
undecided
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
,
General
Carpenter
arrived
,
and
took
up
a
position
on
the
north
side
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
the
Earl
of
Carlisle
and
Lord
Lumley
,
and
rode
at
the
head
of
Churchill
's
,
Molesworth
's
,
and
Cobham
's
dragoons
.
<EOS>
With
these
were
several
regiments
of
horse
,
making
a
total
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
men
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
such
an
accession
of
force
should
have
utterly
extinguished
the
hopes
of
the
insurgents
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
his
arrival
,
General
Carpenter
rode
up
an
eminence
,
and
was
looking
at
the
Windmill
barricade
,
when
a
shot
fired
from
the
cannon
planted
on
that
barrier
fell
very
near
him
,
and
caused
him
to
shift
his
position
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
giving
some
directions
to
Colonel
Churchill
,
<EOS>
General
Wills
rode
up
,
attended
by
Colonel
Pitt
,
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
seeing
him
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
resigning
the
command
of
the
force
to
you
,
general
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
hope
you
will
approve
of
the
manner
in
which
I
have
conducted
the
operations
of
the
siege
.
<EOS>
Even
if
I
had
not
had
the
advantage
of
your
assistance
,
I
doubt
not
that
I
should
have
been
able
to
conclude
the
affair
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
The
rebels
,
I
am
bound
to
say
,
have
fought
very
bravely
,
and
have
made
a
very
gallant
defence
,
especially
the
Highlanders
;
but
I
have
determined
,
at
any
cost
,
to
take
the
barricade
commanded
by
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
and
then
they
must
surrender
.
<EOS>
""You
have
done
very
well
,
general
,
"
replied
Carpenter
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
could
be
better
.
<EOS>
Retain
your
command
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
deprive
you
of
the
victory
you
have
so
nearly
achieved
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
,
general
,
and
am
proud
to
receive
your
commendation
,
"
replied
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
bow
to
your
experience
,
and
any
suggestions
you
may
offer
shall
be
immediately
adopted
.
<EOS>
Before
the
decisive
attack
is
made
,
I
should
wish
you
to
survey
the
town
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
propose
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Carpenter
.
<EOS>
Having
posted
six
squadrons
of
dragoons
under
the
command
of
Colonel
Churchill
to
prevent
any
attempt
at
flight
from
the
Windmill
barricade
,
General
Carpenter
rode
down
towards
the
south
side
of
the
town
with
Wills
.
<EOS>
They
were
attended
by
a
strong
guard
,
and
accompanied
by
the
two
noblemen
previously
mentioned
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
they
met
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
with
a
party
of
militia
,
and
while
General
Carpenter
was
conversing
with
Sir
Henry
,
Parson
Woods
and
a
dozen
of
his
men
came
up
from
the
ford
,
with
some
fugitive
insurgents
,
whom
they
had
just
captured
.
<EOS>
Learning
from
Woods
that
constant
escapes
were
taking
place
from
the
Fishergate
avenue
,
General
Carpenter
gave
orders
that
the
outlet
should
be
effectually
blocked
up
without
delay
,
so
as
not
only
to
check
any
further
flight
,
but
prevent
supplies
of
provisions
from
being
brought
in
.
<EOS>
Finding
that
the
entrance
to
the
Churchgate
avenue
was
inconveniently
crowded
so
that
the
troops
could
not
act
,
Carpenter
made
a
different
disposition
of
the
troops
;
and
deeming
it
probable
that
a
most
determined
attempt
at
escape
might
be
made
from
the
north
of
the
town
,
he
caused
this
outlet
to
be
still
more
strongly
guarded
.
<EOS>
When
all
these
orders
had
been
executed
,
and
every
outlet
was
blocked
up
,
the
two
generals
divided
their
forces
,
and
completely
surrounded
the
town
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIIGeneral
Forster
wishes
to
capitulateFROM
his
post
on
the
church
-
tower
,
Captain
Gordon
had
witnessed
these
proceedings
and
reported
them
to
Brigadier
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
Though
not
disheartened
,
the
brave
old
Highlander
felt
that
the
situation
was
one
of
the
utmost
peril
,
and
could
perceive
only
one
way
of
extricating
himself
from
it
,
but
this
he
was
unwilling
to
adopt
,
unless
joined
by
his
English
allies
,
and
he
felt
sure
that
Forster
had
not
resolution
enough
for
such
a
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
His
men
,
however
,
could
hardly
be
restrained
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
they
discover
that
they
were
pent
up
in
the
town
,
than
they
wished
to
sally
forth
,
sword
in
hand
,
and
cut
their
way
through
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
brigadier
told
them
it
was
too
soon
—
that
they
must
wait
till
night
—
and
if
nothing
happened
in
the
interim
,
he
would
lead
them
forth
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Mackintosh
's
men
were
equally
impatient
,
and
though
they
saw
the
squadrons
of
dragoons
posted
near
the
Lancaster
avenue
,
they
would
have
attempted
to
cut
a
passage
through
them
,
if
allowed
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
a
conference
took
place
at
the
Mitre
between
General
Forster
,
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
now
evident
that
the
town
was
completely
blocked
up
,
and
could
not
hold
out
long
,
it
was
necessary
that
some
terms
of
surrender
should
immediately
be
made
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
recommended
that
a
council
of
war
should
be
called
at
once
,
at
which
all
the
Scottish
leaders
should
assist
,
but
Forster
would
not
accede
to
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
Mackintosh
and
the
rest
are
consulted
,
we
shall
never
be
able
to
make
good
terms
with
Carpenter
and
Wills
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
Let
them
treat
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
it
will
not
be
fair
to
treat
without
them
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
<EOS>
whatever
will
be
done
,
if
Mackintosh
is
consulted
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
Our
estates
I
fear
will
be
confiscated
,
but
we
must
make
an
effort
to
save
our
lives
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
the
attempt
will
be
useless
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
would
die
rather
than
do
aught
dishonourable
.
<EOS>
""There
is
nothing
dishonourable
in
what
I
propose
,
"
said
Forster
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
feel
certain
the
Scots
will
never
consent
to
a
surrender
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
they
would
consider
themselves
degraded
by
such
submission
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"If
they
choose
to
throw
away
their
lives
<EOS>
they
must
do
so
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
not
let
us
act
thus
rashly
.
<EOS>
""I
am
acquainted
with
General
Wills
,
"
said
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
"
and
if
you
desire
it
,
I
will
propose
a
treaty
to
him
.
<EOS>
Rest
assured
,
I
will
assent
to
no
disgraceful
terms
.
<EOS>
"Lord
Derwentwater
was
still
very
unwilling
that
the
step
should
be
taken
without
consulting
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
but
he
yielded
at
last
to
the
representations
of
Lord
Widdrington
and
Forster
.

half
an

preceded
by
a
trumpeter
on
horseback
,
rode
out
of
the
Fishergate
.
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
stopped
by
the
guard
,
but
on
explaining
his
errand
,
was
conducted
by
a
sergeant
and
two
dragoons
to
Wills
's
tent
,
which
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
.
<EOS>
General
Wills
was
seated
at
a
small
table
in
the
centre
of
the
tent
,
when
Colonel
Oxburgh
was
announced
by
a
sentinel
.
<EOS>
Wills
raised
his
head
,
and
looking
at
him
very
sternly
,
demanded
his
business
.
<EOS>
"You
will
guess
it
without
difficulty
,
I
think
,
general
,
"
replied
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
propose
that
the
insurgent
force
shall
lay
down
their
arms
in
the
confident
expectation
that
you
will
recommend
them
for
pardon
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
""Entertain
<EOS>
no
such
expectation
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Wills
,
still
more
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
treat
with
rebels
.
<EOS>
Those
for
whom
you
plead
have
killed
many
of
the
king
's
subjects
,
and
deserve
death
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
since
they
are
willing
to
submit
,
general
,
I
hope
that
consideration
may
be
shown
them
,
"
said
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"Expect
<EOS>
none
from
me
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Wills
,
harshly
.
<EOS>
"
Clemency
is
thrown
away
on
rebels
.
<EOS>
Go
back
to
those
who
sent
you
.
<EOS>
Tell
them
,
if
they
lay
down
their
arms
,
and
submit
themselves
prisoners
at
discretion
,
I
will
prevent
my
soldiers
from
cutting
them
to
pieces
,
and
spare
their
lives
till
his
majesty
's
pleasure
is
known
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
I
will
promise
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
require
an
immediate
decision
,
general?"I
will
give
you
an
hour
—
no
more
,
"
replied
Wills
.
<EOS>
"I
am
greatly
disappointed
,
general
,
"
said
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
I
expected
very
different
terms
from
you
.
<EOS>
""I
have
already
told
you
that
I
will
make
no
terms
with
rebels
such
as
you
,
"
rejoined
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
not
satisfied
,
return
to
the
town
,
and
an
hour
hence
—
to
the
minute
—
I
will
attack
you
,
and
put
you
to
the
sword
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
mean
me
to
understand
,
general
,
"
said
Oxburgh
,
looking
at
him
steadfastly
,
"
that
King
George
will
show
us
no
mercy?""I
do
not
say
that
,
"
replied
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
Nor
do
I
hold
out
any
promise
.
<EOS>
Your
best
chance
of
obtaining
mercy
is
by
surrendering
yourselves
prisoners
at
discretion
.
<EOS>
"Finding
<EOS>
nothing
more
could
be
obtained
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
departed

CHAPTER
VCaptain
Dalziel
has
a
Conference
with
WillsINQUIRING
glances
were
thrown
at
the
envoy
as
he
rode
through
the
Fishergate
barricade
,
but
he
went
on
till
he
was
stopped
by
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
who
said
to
him
in
a
fierce
voice:"What
means
this
cessation
of
arms
?
<EOS>
Why
have
you
quitted
the
town
?
<EOS>
You
have
been
sent
by
Forster
to
propose
a
treaty
for
capitulation
—
and
without
privity
or
concurrence
of
the
Scots
.
<EOS>
""General
<EOS>
Forster
has
betrayed
us
—
has
sold
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
several
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
shoot
him
.
<EOS>
""No
treaty
has
been
agreed
upon
,
"
cried
Oxburgh
in
a
loud
voice
,
so
that
all
might
hear
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
General
Wills
,
who
demands
an
unconditional
surrender
from
all
—
Scotsmen
as
well
as
Englishmen
.
<EOS>
An
hour
is
granted
for
consideration
—
but
a
fourth
part
of
the
time
has
already
expired
,
"
he
added
,
consulting
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"What
say
you
,
my
men
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
surrender?""Never
!
"
<EOS>
they
cried
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
die
sword
in
hand
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
warn
you
that
no
quarter
will
be
given
,
"
said
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"We
will
neither
give
nor
take
quarter
,
"
cried
the
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
show
the
Southrons
how
brave
men
can
die
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
am
to
understand
,
brigadier
,
that
you
utterly
refuse
the
terms
?
"
said
Oxburgh
.
"Utterly
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
Just
then
General
Forster
was
seen
coming
along
on
horseback
,
accompanied
by
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
Fearing
some
mischief
might
happen
in
the
present
infuriated
state
of
the
Highlanders
,
Oxburgh
signed
to
the
general
to
go
back
,
and
the
brigadier
also
called
to
his
men
energetically
to
keep
quiet
,
but
despite
the
interdiction
,
several
shots
were
fired
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
Forster
escaped
,
but
he
would
not
expose
himself
further
.
<EOS>
Turning
round
,
he
galloped
back
towards
the
market
-
place
,
followed
more
deliberately
by
the
two
noblemen
.
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
,
the
Earl
of
Nithsdale
,
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
the
Earl
of
Carnwath
,
and
his
brother
Captain
Dalziel
,
rode
up
to
the
spot
,
and
stopping
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
who
was
about
to
depart
,
demanded
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
"We
have
been
betrayed
by
Forster
—
that
is
all
that
can
be
told
,
"
cried
Mackintosh
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"General
<EOS>
Forster
is
no
traitor
,
my
lords
,
"
said
Oxburgh
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
seen
Wills
,
who
refuses
to
make
any
treaty
with
us
,
and
insists
that
we
shall
lay
down
our
arms
.
<EOS>
Our
answer
must
be
given
within
an
hour
,
and
but
little
of
it
now
remains
.
<EOS>
""We
have
had
no
time
for
deliberation
,
"
said
Lord
Carnwath
.
<EOS>
"Perchance
<EOS>
,
if
you
go
to
General
Wills
in
person
,
my
lords
,
you
may
obtain
some
further
respite
,
"
said
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
obtain
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Shall
<EOS>
I
go
as
representative
of
the
Scottish
forces
?
"
said
Captain
Dalziel
.
<EOS>
"Go
<EOS>
at
once
,
or
it
will
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
many
minutes
left
,
"
said
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
agree
to
the
step
,
brigadier
?
"
asked
Captain
Dalziel
.
<EOS>
"Act
<EOS>
as
those
desire
who
have
more
to
lose
than
I
have
,
"
said
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"Then
go
,
"
cried
the
three
Scottish
nobles
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
Captain
Dalziel
rode
forth
,
and
preceded
by
the
same
trumpeter
who
had
attended
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
made
all
haste
to
General
Wills
's
tent
.
<EOS>
A
conference
was
granted
him
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
aware
of
the
terms
I
have
offered
to
Colonel
Oxburgh
?
"
said
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
They
apply
to
the
whole
rebel
army
—
English
and
Scots
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
no
distinction
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
the
Scottish
chiefs
,
whom
I
represent
,
request
some
further
time
—
say
till
seven
o'clock
tomorrow
morning
—
to
consult
as
to
the
best
mode
of
delivering
up
our
forces
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
an
easy
matter
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
find
it
difficult
,
leave
it
to
me
,
"
said
Wills
,
with
a
stern
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
grant
the
delay
you
request
without
consulting
General
Carpenter
—
but
you
shall
hear
from
me
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
a
haughty
bow
he
dismissed
him
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIHow
Forster
learnt
that
he
had
been
betrayedAFTER
riding
away
from
the
exasperated
Highlanders
<EOS>
,
Forster
alighted
at
the
town
-
hall
,
and
meeting
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Captain
Shaftoe
told
them
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
believe
Brigadier
Mackintosh
has
ordered
his
Highlanders
to
shoot
me
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
life
will
not
be
safe
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
think
it
,
general
,
"
rejoined
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"
The
brigadier
is
incapable
of
such
an
act
.
<EOS>
But
you
had
better
not
expose
yourself
while
the
negotiation
for
the
surrender
is
going
on
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
take
care
not
to
do
so
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
remain
here
for
an
hour
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
""Mrs
.
<EOS>
Scarisbrick
!
"
exclaimed
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"
Have
you
not
heard?""Heard
what
?
"
exclaimed
Forster
,
looking
at
him
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
her
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
expected
to
find
her
here
.
<EOS>
""She
is
here
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
not
explain
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
,
and
you
shall
know
all
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
without
a
strange
misgiving
did
Forster
follow
him
along
a
passage
on
the
ground
floor
,
at
a
door
in
which
an
elderly
female
was
stationed
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
you
will
find
her
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
,
in
a
strangely
significant
tone
.
"Impossible
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Forster
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
general
,
she
is
here
<EOS>
,
"
remarked
the
old
woman
,
opening
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
not
been
disturbed
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
room
was
darkened
,
but
there
was
light
enough
to
discern
a
very
startling
object
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
dead
body
of
a
very
beautiful
woman
lying
extended
upon
a
couch
.
<EOS>
Her
habiliments
were
those
in
which
she
had
died
,
and
her
profuse
golden
tresses
were
unbound
,
and
scattered
over
her
bosom
where
she
had
received
the
deadly
hurt
.
<EOS>
Giving
utterance
to
a
cry
,
Forster
rushed
forward
,
and
seizing
her
hand
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"This
completes
my
misery
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
losing
her
I
have
lost
all
that
was
dear
to
me
,
and
I
care
not
how
soon
I
follow
.
<EOS>
""She
deserved
her
fate
,
"
said
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"
She
betrayed
you
and
us
to
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
She
was
accidentally
shot
last
night
,
while
returning
from
a
secret
visit
to
General
Wills
.
<EOS>
I
brought
her
here
myself
.
<EOS>
I
found
letters
upon
her
which
prove
her
guilt
.
<EOS>
I
intended
to
conceal
this
catastrophe
from
you
—
but
it
is
better
you
should
know
it
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
affirm
the
truth
of
what
you
have
just
stated
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Forster
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
every
particular
,
"
rejoined
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
completely
duped
by
her
.
<EOS>
"Forster
dropped
the
hand
he
had
hitherto
held
,
and
without
a
word
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIColonel
CottonIN
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
,
General
Forster
,
Lord
Derwentwater
,
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
and
all
the
rebel
lords
and
leaders
were
assembled
at
the
Mitre
,
engaged
in
a
very
angry
discussion
,
when
a
chamade
beaten
at
the
door
,
produced
a
sudden
quietude
,
and
<EOS>
a
tall
,
fine
-
looking
officer
in
the
accoutrements
of
the
king
's
dragoons
came
into
the
room
,
being
announced
by
the
sentinel
as
Colonel
Cotton
.
<EOS>
All
bowed
as
he
advanced
towards
the
centre
of
the
room
,
when
looking
round
,
he
said
courteously:"You
will
guess
my
errand
,
my
lords
and
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
I
am
sent
by
General
Wills
to
receive
your
positive
answer
to
his
proposition
.
<EOS>
""We
are
unable
to
send
a
precise
answer
to
General
Wills
,
"
said
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
"
because
the
Scots
are
unwilling
to
capitulate
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
and
the
Scottish
nobles
will
tell
you
that
this
is
the
case
.
<EOS>
""My
men
absolutely
refuse
to
lay
down
their
arms
,
"
said
the
brigadier
,
"
and
it
is
the
same
with
the
Clan
Chattan
,
commanded
by
my
kinsman
,
Colonel
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
,
by
to
-
morrow
morning
,
we
may
bring
them
to
reason
,
"
said
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"
Just
now
,
it
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
""I
will
report
what
you
tell
me
to
General
Wills
,
"
said
Cotton
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
about
to
depart
,
word
was
brought
that
the
drummer
had
been
shot
while
beating
a
chamade
before
a
house
,
whence
firing
had
taken
place
subsequent
to
the
cessation
of
arms
.
<EOS>
This
unlucky
incident
seemed
likely
to
put
an
end
to
the
negotiation
,
but
it
was
counterbalanced
by
another
great
provocation
to
the
rebels
,
which
they
were
disposed
to
resent
.
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
insurgents
,
led
by
Cornet
Shuttleworth
,
had
managed
to
reach
the
ford
at
Penwortham
,
when
they
were
attacked
,
and
in
consequence
of
their
resistance
,
put
to
death
.
<EOS>
After
these
events
had
been
referred
to
,
Colonel
Cotton
addressed
the
English
and
Scottish
lords
and
chiefs
,
and
said
,
in
order
to
prevent
further
bloodshed
,
he
would
agree
—
in
General
Wills
's
name
—
to
grant
the
time
required
,
<EOS>
provided
they
pledged
their
word
that
no
new
works
should
be
thrown
up
,
and
no
further
attempt
be
made
to
escape
.
<EOS>
Promises
to
this
effect
being
given
,
Colonel
Cotton
departed
.

CHAPTER
VIIIHostages
requiredGENERAL
WILLS
,
however
,
did
not
appear
satisfied
with
what
had
been
done
.
<EOS>
About
an
hour
later
,
Colonel
Churchill
and
Colonel
Nassau
entered
the
town
,
and
on
the
part
of
Generals
Carpenter
and
Wills
,
declared
that
an
English
and
a
Scottish
nobleman
must
be
delivered
up
as
hostages
for
the
due
fulfilment
of
the
conditions
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
require
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
on
the
part
of
the
English
,
and
Lord
Kenmure
on
that
of
the
Scots
,
"
said
Colonel
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
not
take
General
Forster
?
"
asked
Captain
Dalziel
.
<EOS>
"We
prefer
Lord
Derwentwater
or
Lord
Widdrington
,
"
replied
Churchill
,
with
a
singular
smile
.
<EOS>
"I
must
tell
you
frankly
,
colonel
,
"
said
Dalziel
,
"
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
Scots
,
General
Forster
has
made
an
arrangement
for
himself
through
Colonel
Oxburgh
with
General
Wills
.
<EOS>
It
has
clearly
been
ascertained
that
a
lady
of
great
personal
beauty
,
who
had
extraordinary
influence
over
General
Forster
,
gave
secret
information
to
General
Wills
.
<EOS>
Last
night
she
was
accidentally
shot
while
returning
from
a
visit
<EOS>
—
it
is
supposed
—
to
your
camp
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
we
find
that
a
proposal
for
surrender
is
made
by
General
Forster
without
consulting
us
—
and
that
when
a
hostage
is
required
,
it
is
not
Forster
,
but
Lord
Derwentwater
who
is
selected
,
can
you
wonder
we
believe
we
are
betrayed
?
<EOS>
Here
is
a
general
who
refuses
to
march
or
fight
—
who
declares
the
enemy
is
at
a
distance
when
he
proves
to
be
close
at
hand
—
who
has
intimate
relations
with
a
lady
,
who
acts
as
a
spy
—
and
who
proposes
to
surrender
,
and
makes
terms
for
himself
,
while
we
desire
to
continue
the
contest
—
can
we
doubt
that
he
is
a
traitor?""You
do
not
expect
us
to
sympathise
with
you
because
you
have
an
incompetent
leader
?
"
said
Colonel
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"Incapacity
<EOS>
is
one
thing
—
treachery
another
,
colonel
,
"
said
Captain
Dalziel
.
<EOS>
"
We
Scots
all
believe
Forster
has
played
us
false
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
his
life
is
secure
.
<EOS>
Take
him
with
you
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
safer
with
you
than
with
us
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
orders
are
explicit
,
"
said
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
bring
either
of
the
English
lords
I
have
mentioned
,
and
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
""Lord
<EOS>
Kenmure
will
not
come
out
,
"
said
Dalziel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
will
my
brother
,
Lord
Carnwath
—
or
any
other
Scottish
noble
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
must
come
with
me
,
"
said
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
brigadier
is
gone
to
bed
,
greatly
fatigued
,
"
replied
Dalziel
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
regard
that
as
a
mere
excuse
,
"
said
Churchill
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
the
treaty
will
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
For
the
sake
of
the
garrison
,
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
If
the
attack
is
recommenced
,
none
will
be
spared
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
Colonel
Mackintosh
alighted
at
the
door
of
the
inn
,
and
were
announced
by
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
Both
saluted
Colonel
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"Colonel
<EOS>
Mackintosh
and
myself
are
come
to
offer
ourselves
as
hostages
if
required
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
desire
that
any
needless
difficulties
should
be
raised
,
and
are
therefore
ready
to
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
surrender
myself
with
his
lordship
,
"
said
Colonel
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"I
should
be
sorry
if
the
treaty
were
sacrificed
,
"
said
Churchill
;
"
and
am
therefore
obliged
to
your
lordship
and
Colonel
Mackintosh
for
the
humane
step
you
have
taken
.
<EOS>
You
have
saved
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
""Had
<EOS>
not
General
Forster
been
our
leader
,
the
garrison
would
never
have
been
in
this
strait
,
"
said
Colonel
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
We
might
have
been
overcome
,
but
we
would
not
have
died
without
inflicting
some
loss
on
our
assailants
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
better
as
it
is
,
"
said
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
receive
the
paroles
of
honour
of
certain
gentlemen
that
they
will
perform
their
promises
,
and
then
I
will
conduct
you
to
General
Wills

<EOS>
""We
will
ride
on
to
the
Fishergate
outlet
and
await
you
there
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
We
care
not
to
parade
ourselves
as
prisoners

<EOS>
"Colonel
<EOS>
Churchill
signified
his
assent
,
and
the
party
separated
.

CHAPTER
IXIn
what
Manner
the
Hostages
were
received
by
General
WillsGENERAL
CARPENTER
was
not
present
when
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
Colonel
Mackintosh
were
brought
as
hostages
to
Wills
,
but
Brigadier
Munden
,
Colonels
Pitt
,
Wynn
,
and
Stanhope
were
with
him
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
The
severe
commander
received
the
hostages
very
haughtily
,
and
knitted
his
dark
brows
as
he
regarded
them
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
comported
himself
with
great
dignity
,
but
Colonel
Mackintosh
could
scarcely
restrain
his
anger
,
especially
when
Wills
asked:"Why
have
we
not
a
Scotch
nobleman
?
<EOS>
I
required
Lord
Nithsdale
or
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
""They
declined
to
come
,
general
,
"
replied
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"Methinks
,
the
chief
of
the
Clan
Chattan
might
suffice
,
"
said
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
I
refused
to
surrender
not
a
Highlander
would
have
laid
down
his
arms
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
not
one
would
have
escaped
,
"
rejoined
Wills
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
you
can
stand
against
the
king
's
troops
go
back
to
the
town
,
and
I
will
immediately
attack
you
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
take
you
at
your
word
,
I
presume
you
will
give
General
Forster
a
safe-
conduct
?
"
rejoined
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
Wills
looked
fiercely
at
him
,
but
made
no
response
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
Colonel
Mackintosh
returns
,
I
shall
return
,
general
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
,
"
and
then
the
truce
will
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Attack
us
when
you
please
,
we
shall
be
prepared
for
you
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
your
decision
,
my
lord
,
"
cried
Mackintosh
,
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
""Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Wills
,
who
did
not
desire
that
matters
should
take
this
turn
.
"
<EOS>
Since
the
arrangement
is
partly
concluded
,
I
will
not
disturb
it
.
<EOS>
By
to-
morrow
these
feelings
of
irritation
will
have
calmed
down
,
and
then
you
will
see
that
I
have
granted
all
I
could
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
has
been
granted
,
"
said
Colonel
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
worse
off
to-
morrow
than
we
are
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Let
us
die
together
at
Preston
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
depart
,
"
said
Wills
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
you
may
have
an
opportunity
of
proving
your
bravery
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
you
must
remain
here
.
<EOS>
Let
them
be
taken
to
their
quarters
,
colonel
,
"
he
added
to
Churchill
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
I
can
not
offer
you
better
accommodation
.
<EOS>
""Make
<EOS>
no
apologies
,
general
,
"
said
Lord
Derwentwater
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
We
know
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
.
<EOS>
"They
were
then
taken
to
a
farm
-
house
,
where
Parson
Woods
and
his
men
were
quartered
,
and
where
very
inconvenient
lodgings
were
found
for
them
.

CHAPTER
XBrigadier
Mackintosh
dissuades
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
from
sallying
forthNO
sooner
did
it
become
known
that
a
capitulation
had
been
agreed
on
than
Lord
Wintoun
went
to
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
who
so
far
from
having
retired
to
rest
,
was
greatly
on
the
alert
,
and
entreated
him
to
allow
a
strong
body
of
his
Highlanders
to
line
the
hedges
on
the
Lancaster
avenue
,
while
he
made
a
determined
attempt
at
escape
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
be
accompanied
by
Major
Nairn
,
Captain
Philip
Lockhart
,
Captain
Shaftoe
,
and
a
dozen
others
,
and
we
will
either
effect
an
escape
or
sell
our
lives
dearly
.
<EOS>
""It
is
too
late
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
My
Highlanders
could
render
you
little
assistance
.
<EOS>
The
Lancaster
avenue
is
now
guarded
by
six
squadrons
of
dragoons
in
addition
to
the
former
guard
,
so
that
you
will
infallibly
be
cut
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
hostages
have
been
given
,
and
that
alone
ought
to
deter
you
from
making
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
we
must
remain
tamely
here
?
"
said
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"There
is
no
help
for
it
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
had
my
own
way
,
things
should
never
have
come
to
this
pass
.
<EOS>
We
ought
to
have
cut
our
way
out
before
the
arrival
of
General
Carpenter
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
we
any
chance
of
escape
now
,
think
you
?
"
asked
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"Very
little
,
I
fear
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
be
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
any
unforeseen
circumstances
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
that
any
will
occur
—
but
it
may
be!"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIThe
Terms
of
the
Treaty
are
<EOS>
acceptedA
DISMAL
day
dawned
on
Preston
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
had
heard
of
the
capitulation
;
but
did
not
feel
sure
it
would
be
carried
out
—
many
of
the
more
timid
being
apprehensive
that
the
town
would
still
be
the
scene
of
a
most
sanguinary
conflict
.
<EOS>
In
the
opinion
of
these
persons
the
Highlanders
would
not
submit
,
but
would
make
a
most
desperate
attempt
to
sally
forth
,
which
would
end
in
their
extermination
.
<EOS>
The
English
insurgents
had
made
up
their
minds
to
surrender
,
and
seemed
hardly
able
to
realise
the
position
in
which
they
were
placed
,
for
most
of
them
displayed
unaccountable
indifference
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
they
persuaded
themselves
that
clemency
would
be
shown
them
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
they
were
mistaken
.
<EOS>
The
town
-
hall
was
crowded
with
ladies
who
had
passed
the
night
there
,
and
did
not
mean
to
quit
the
asylum
till
all
was
settled
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
and
for
the
last
time
,
Captain
Gordon
ascended
the
church
-
tower
at
break
of
day
,
and
looked
around
.
<EOS>
The
besiegers
had
drawn
so
much
nearer
to
the
town
,
that
they
seemed
now
quite
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
The
militia
had
likewise
quitted
their
position
on
the
south
bank
of
the
Ribble
,
and
stationed
themselves
near
the
upper
end
of
the
Wigan
road
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
town
was
completely
invested
,
and
Captain
Gordon
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
break
through
such
a
cordon
.
<EOS>
In
the
Churchgate
and
Fishergate
the
barricades
were
undisturbed
,
but
no
preparations
were
made
for
the
renewal
of
the
fight
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
was
no
longer
at
his
post
,
and
most
of
the
Highlanders
had
retired
to
the
houses
,
anxious
to
snatch
a
few
hours
'
rest
,
and
certain
they
would
be
summoned
when
required
.
<EOS>
No
sound
of
bagpipes
was
heard
.
<EOS>
The
neglected
batteries
,
deserted
streets
,
and
dejected
air
of
such
troopers
as
could
be
seen
,
offered
a
marked
contrast
to
the
formidable
appearance
of
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gordon
felt
that
the
contest
was
over
,
and
desired
to
see
no
more
.
<EOS>
Later
on
,
all
the
English
and
Scottish
leaders
,
with
the
exception
of
the
two
who
had
surrendered
themselves
as
hostages
,
assembled
at
the
Mitre
,
when
it
was
finally
agreed
that
the
terms
of
the
treaty
should
be
accepted
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
men
are
willing
to
submit
,
"
said
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
But
they
look
upon
themselves
as
sacrificed
.
<EOS>
Bitterly
do
I
now
reproach
myself
that
I
ever
brought
them
to
England
against
their
will
,
and
that
I
did
not
turn
back
at
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
They
might
have
helped
the
Earl
of
Mar
to
win
a
battle
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellows
!
<EOS>
they
will
now
be
transported
and
sold
as
slaves
.
<EOS>
My
heart
bleeds
for
them
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
Scots
have
all
cause
to
regret
that
we
ever
crossed
the
Border
,
"
said
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
have
done
our
best
for
King
James
,
and
if
we
had
been
supported
,
we
might
have
succeeded
.
<EOS>
We
have
had
a
High
Tory
general
,
yet
not
one
of
the
party
has
joined
us
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
one
can
have
been
more
disappointed
than
myself
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
had
only
reached
Manchester—""Why
did
we
not
reach
that
town
?
<EOS>
tell
us
that
,
"
cried
Brigadier
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
admit
we
ought
not
to
have
stayed
so
long
in
Preston
,
"
said
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
all
seemed
unwilling
to
quit
your
quarters
,
and
I
apprehended
no
danger
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
idle
to
regret
the
past
,
"
said
Lord
Widdrington
;
"
you
have
complained
of
the
absence
of
the
High
Church
Tories
,
my
lord
,
"
he
added
,
to
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
can
not
say
that
the
Roman
Catholics
have
failed
you
.
<EOS>
""No
,
they
have
proved
our
staunchest
friends
,
"
replied
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
"
And
a
braver
and
a
better
commander
can
not
be
found
than
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
that
we
all
agree
,
"
said
Lord
Nithsdale
and
the
other
Scottish
nobles
.
<EOS>
"The
hour
at
which
the
armistice
expires
is
close
at
hand
,
"
said
Forster
,
"
and
we
must
therefore
prepare
to
conclude
this
painful
business
properly
.
<EOS>
We
will
remain
here
,
but
all
the
officers
—
English
and
Scotch
—
must
forthwith
assemble
within
the
churchyard
to
deliver
up
their
arms
.
<EOS>
Let
immediate
orders
be
given
to
that
effect
,
"
he
added
to
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Captain
Dalziel
,
who
at
once
departed
on
the
errand
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIIThe
Insurgent
Officers
deliver
up
their
SwordsSHORTLY
afterwards
,
in
obedience
to
Forster
's
orders
,
all
the
officers
of
the
insurgent
force
assembled
in
the
churchyard
,
and
though
they
endeavoured
to
assume
a
careless
air
many
of
them
looked
very
downcast
.
<EOS>
Among
them
were
all
those
who
had
recently
joined
at
Lancaster
and
Preston
,
and
received
the
rank
of
captain
—
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Townley
,
of
Townley
,
Sir
Francis
Anderton
,
Ralph
Standish
,
Gabriel
Hesketh
,
John
Tyldesley
,
John
Dalton
,
and
several
others
.
<EOS>
They
had
had
but
a
short
campaign
,
and
might
now
have
to
pay
for
their
devotion
with
their
lives
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
bore
themselves
bravely
under
the
distressing
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
annoyance
of
the
ceremonial
was
heightened
by
its
publicity
.
<EOS>
A
large
concourse
was
collected
in
the
churchyard
,
and
among
the
spectators
were
a
great
number
of
the
fair
sex
who
flocked
thither
to
manifest
their
sympathy
with
their
lovers
.
<EOS>
They
expressed
their
grief
in
the
liveliest
manner
.
<EOS>
Dryope
was
there
,
and
Captain
Shaftoe
had
some
difficulty
in
inducing
her
to
stand
back
.
<EOS>
But
she
remained
at
a
short
distance
gazing
at
him
through
her
tears
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
these
fair
damsels
,
who
formed
the
foremost
rank
of
the
spectators
,
gave
a
curious
character
to
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Precisely
at
the
appointed
hour
,
Lord
Forrester
,
preceded
by
a
trumpet
and
a
drum
,
and
attended
by
a
guard
,
entered
the
town
,
and
rode
to
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Alighting
at
the
gate
,
and
followed
by
a
couple
of
men
,
he
marched
up
to
the
rebel
officers
.
<EOS>
Lord
Forrester
was
a
tall
,
fine
-
looking
man
,
well
suited
to
the
office
,
which
he
performed
with
courtesy
.
<EOS>
"Gentlemen
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
them
,
"
I
have
a
very
painful
duty
to
discharge
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
receive
the
arms
of
brave
and
honourable
men
,
which
ought
to
have
been
used
for
their
king
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
this
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
who
stood
next
him
,
replied
as
he
delivered
up
his
sword:"Our
arms
have
been
used
,
my
lord
,
for
our
rightful
sovereign
and
against
a
usurper
.
<EOS>
"Lord
Forrester
made
no
remark
but
consigned
the
sword
to
the
custody
of
one
of
his
men
,
and
passed
on
.
<EOS>
He
had
received
more
than
twenty
swords
,
when
he
came
to
Captain
Shaftoe
,
and
as
there
seemed
to
be
some
hesitation
on
Shaftoe
's
part
,
he
said:"Your
sword
,
Sir?""Take
it
,
"
cried
Shaftoe
.
<EOS>
And
plucking
the
blade
from
the
sheath
,
he
broke
it
,
and
flung
the
pieces
at
Lord
Forrester
's
feet
.
<EOS>
On
this
there
were
shouts
of
applause
from
the
female
spectators
.
<EOS>
"I
suppose
it
was
to
win
that
applause
that
this
foolish
act
was
done
,
Captain
Shaftoe
,
"
observed
Lord
Forrester
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
broken
the
treaty
,
and
have
rendered
yourself
liable
to
the
punishment
of
death
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
these
words
were
uttered
,
Dryope
and
three
or
four
of
the
fair
spectators
rushed
forward
,
and
threw
themselves
at
Lord
Forrester
's
feet
exclaiming:"Spare
him
!
<EOS>
spare
him!""Rise
,
ladies
!
"
said
Lord
Forrester
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
about
to
order
Captain
Shaftoe
's
immediate
execution
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
<EOS>
so
great
<EOS>
a
favourite
of
your
sex
should
refuse
to
submit
—
but
no
doubt
you
can
bring
him
to
reason
.
<EOS>
I
leave
him
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
passed
on
to
Sir
Francis
Anderton
and
Mr.
Townley
,
who
were
next
,
and
received
their
swords
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
gentlemen
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
sorry
to
find
you
here
.
<EOS>
Had
you
remained
quiet
for
a
few
days
you
would
have
escaped
this
disaster
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
followed
the
example
of
the
cautious
High
Church
Tories!""We
have
done
what
seems
right
to
us
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Mr.
Townley
,
haughtily
,
"
and
are
prepared
for
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
last
sword
received
by
Lord
Forrester
was
that
of
Captain
Wogan
,
who
said
to
him:"Your
looks
reproach
me
,
my
lord
,
but
I
do
not
reproach
myself
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
had
fifty
swords
,
they
should
all
have
been
devoted
to
King
James
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
a
military
salute
to
the
unfortunate
officers
<EOS>
,
Lord
Forrester
then
quitted
the
churchyard
,
followed
by
his
men
,
bearing
two
large
bundles
of
swords
,
and
proceeded
to
the
Mitre
,
there
to
go
through
a
like
ceremony
with
General
Forster
and
the
lords

XIIIHow
Brigadier
Mackintosh
parted
with
his
ClaymoreBy
this
time
,
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Colonel
Mackintosh
had
returned
,
but
were
merely
spectators
of
the
scene
—
their
swords
having
been
delivered
up
at
the
time
of
their
surrender
.
<EOS>
The
Scottish
nobles
behaved
with
great
dignity
,
and
were
treated
with
the
utmost
respect
by
Lord
Forrester
,
who
made
no
remark
calculated
to
give
them
pain
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
Brigadier
Mackintosh
's
courage
forsook
him
.
<EOS>
Kissing
the
hilt
of
his
claymore
,
as
he
gave
up
the
weapon
,
he
said
in
broken
accents:"Farewell
,
old
friend
!
<EOS>
I
never
thought
to
part
with
you
,
save
with
life!"The
ceremony
was
soon
over
,
for
Lord
Forrester
did
not
needlessly
prolong
it
.
<EOS>
Before
departing
,
he
said
,
addressing
the
assemblage:"An
hour
hence
,
General
Carpenter
will
enter
the
town
to
receive
his
prisoners
.
<EOS>
By
that
time
,
the
entire
rebel
force
must
be
drawn
up
in
the
market-
place
to
surrender
arms
.
<EOS>
None
must
be
absent
,
on
any
pretence
whatever
,
and
on
pain
of
severe
punishment
.
<EOS>
For
the
execution
of
this
order
,
I
look
to
you
,
General
Forster
,
to
you
,
my
Lord
Derwentwater
,
to
you
,
my
Lord
Widdrington
,
to
you
my
lords
,
"
turning
to
the
Scottish
nobles
,
"
to
you
,
brigadier
,
and
to
you
,
Colonel
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
""My
lord
,
"
remonstrated
the
brigadier
,
"
an
hour
is
but
a
short
time
to
bring
together
a
number
of
unruly
Highlanders—""It
must
suffice
,
"
interrupted
Lord
Forrester
.
<EOS>
"
You
could
get
them
ready
for
action
in
that
time
.
<EOS>
""True
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
But
a
surrender
is
different
.
<EOS>
They
will
have
to
be
driven
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
""Colonel
<EOS>
Mackintosh
,
I
trust
you
see
no
difficulty
?
"
said
Lord
Forrester
,
turning
to
the
chief
.
<EOS>
"None
,
my
lord
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"
My
clansmen
will
die
with
me
,
if
I
bid
them
.
<EOS>
""In
an
hour
,
then
,
"
said
Forrester
as
he
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mounting
his
horse
,
and
attended
by
the
guard
,
bearing
the
arms
,
he
galloped
off
to
General
Carpenter
's
quarters
.
<EOS>
"What
has
been
done
?
"
asked
Carpenter
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
business
is
settled
,
"
replied
Lord
Forrester
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
hour
hence
the
entire
rebel
force
will
surrender
in
the
market
-
place
.

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIVThe
Two
Generals
enter
the
TownAMID
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
drums
,
General
Carpenter
entered
the
conquered
town
at
the
head
of
two
regiments
of
dragoons
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
the
Earl
of
Carlisle
and
Lord
Lumley
,
and
had
with
him
Colonels
Churchill
and
Molesworth
,
and
a
brilliant
staff
of
officers
.
<EOS>
As
he
rode
slowly
along
Church
-
street
,
by
which
avenue
he
made
his
entrance
,
he
looked
with
some
curiosity
at
the
blackened
remains
of
the
houses
,
and
other
evidences
of
the
fight
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
he
halted
on
the
spot
where
the
barricade
had
been
reared
,
and
explained
what
had
been
done
to
the
noblemen
with
him
,
giving
Brigadier
Mackintosh
full
credit
for
his
plan
of
defence
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
barriers
could
not
have
been
better
placed
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
though
the
town
must
have
succumbed
to
Wills
,
it
might
have
held
out
for
another
day
—
perhaps
till
now
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
these
remarks
,
with
which
Churchill
and
Molesworth
entirely
concurred
<EOS>
,
he
proceeded
towards
the
market
-
place
,
noticing
everything
as
he
rode
on
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
martial
strains
resounding
at
the
north
side
of
the
town
,
announced
the
entrance
of
General
Wills
and
four
regiments
of
dragoons
by
the
Lancaster
avenue
.
<EOS>
Wills
was
attended
by
Brigadiers
Pitt
and
Dormer
,
and
,
like
General
Carpenter
,
had
a
staff
of
officers
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
the
curiosity
to
look
around
,
and
scarcely
troubled
himself
to
consider
where
the
Windmill
barricade
had
been
situated
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
dragoons
,
just
mentioned
,
three
regiments
of
foot
,
commanded
by
Lord
Forrester
,
Captain
Sabine
,
and
Captain
Fane
,
entered
by
the
Fishergate
avenue
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
imposing
military
display
,
very
few
persons
were
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
,
and
but
few
shouts
welcomed
the
victors
.
<EOS>
In
the
market
-
place
,
a
very
striking
,
but
very
sad
spectacle
was
to
be
seen
,
and
this
attracted
all
the
townsfolk
who
could
find
access
thither
.
<EOS>
Here
,
as
enjoined
by
the
conquerors
,
all
the
insurgent
troops
were
drawn
up
preparatory
to
a
general
surrender
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
they
were
all
there
—
with
the
exception
of
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
's
troop
,
commanded
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Captain
Shaftoe
,
and
comprising
all
the
handsome
young
gentlemen
,
of
whom
so
much
has
been
said
—
Lord
Widdrington
's
troop
,
commanded
by
Captain
Errington
and
Captain
Gascoigne
—
the
moss
-
troopers
and
Borderers
,
commanded
by
Captains
Douglas
and
Hunter
,
and
the
troop
commanded
by
the
brave
Wogan
.
<EOS>
Here
also
were
the
five
troops
of
South
Country
Scots
,
respectively
commanded
by
Lord
Kenmure
,
the
Honourable
James
Hume
,
Lord
Wintoun
,
Lord
Carnwath
,
and
Captain
Lockhart
.
<EOS>
Here
,
also
,
were
the
whole
of
the
Highlanders
,
with
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
and
his
kinsman
,
Colonel
Mackintosh
,
at
their
head
.
<EOS>
We
have
said
that
General
Forster
was
absent
.
<EOS>
He
excused
himself
on
the
plea
that
his
life
was
in
danger
from
the
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
On
this
very
spot
,
only
a
few
days
ago
,
all
these
troops
had
been
assembled
to
proclaim
King
James
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
they
were
confident
of
success
.
<EOS>
They
felt
certain
of
receiving
large
reinforcements
,
and
believed
they
should
be
able
to
reach
London
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
And
,
perhaps
,
they
might
.
<EOS>
But
the
delay
at
Preston
proved
fatal
.
<EOS>
Caught
in
a
snare
,
they
had
allowed
their
enemies
to
check
them
—
to
overtake
them
.
<EOS>
The
most
painful
reflection
that
forced
itself
upon
all
the
insurgent
officers
and
gentlemen
was
that
they
were
destroyed
by
their
own
folly
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
they
had
not
yielded
to
the
allurements
of
the
fair
sex
,
but
had
marched
on
resolutely!As
the
ladies
gazed
at
their
lovers
from
the
windows
overlooking
the
place
,
they
thought
them
woefully
changed
.
<EOS>
Their
gay
galliard
air
was
quite
gone
.
<EOS>
Some
appeared
indifferent
,
but
it
was
easy
to
be
seen
that
their
levity
was
assumed
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
two
victorious
generals
arrived
in
the
market
-
place
,
and
had
satisfied
themselves
that
the
whole
of
the
rebel
force
was
assembled
,
all
the
men
were
ordered
to
pile
their
arms
,
and
this
done
the
officers
and
gentlemen
volunteers
belonging
to
the
Northumbrian
force
were
secured
,
and
removed
to
commodious
houses
,
where
they
were
strictly
guarded
,
but
allowed
to
see
their
fair
friends
,
who
quickly
paid
them
a
visit
.
<EOS>
The
noblemen
and
superior
officers
were
taken
to
the
inns
and
various
private
houses
;
but
the
common
soldiers
and
Highlanders
were
marched
off
to
the
church
,
which
served
as
their
prison
during
their
stay
in
Preston
.
<EOS>
Here
they
were
allowed
no
better
fare
than
bread
and
water
,
supplied
to
them
at
the
expense
of
the
town
,
and
as
they
suffered
frightfully
from
the
cold
,
they
tore
the
linings
from
the
pews
to
afford
themselves
a
scanty
covering
.

CHAPTER
XVThe
Town
is
plundered
by
the
SoldieryHaving
seen
the
prisoners
disposed
of
,
and
given
all
necessary
orders
respecting
them
,
the
two
generals
,
accompanied
by
the
Earl
of
Carlisle
,
Lord
Lumley
,
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
,
Brigadier
Honeywood
,
Colonel
Stanhope
,
and
several
others
,
entered
the
town
-
hall
,
where
a
cold
collation
was
laid
out
for
them
.
<EOS>
To
this
repast
Parson
Woods
,
who
had
been
presented
to
General
Carpenter
,
was
invited
,
and
received
many
compliments
on
,
his
bravery
.
<EOS>
The
generals
were
still
at
table
,
when
they
were
informed
that
a
deputation
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
was
without
,
and
prayed
for
an
immediate
audience
.
<EOS>
Wills
guessed
their
errand
,
and
if
left
to
himself
,
would
have
refused
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
But
General
Carpenter
caused
half
a
dozen
of
the
applicants
to
be
admitted
,
and
then
found
that
their
object
was
to
prevent
the
town
from
being
plundered
by
the
soldiery
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
pillage
has
already
commenced
,
"
said
one
of
the
persons
,
who
acted
as
spokesman
,
"
and
unless
the
men
are
restrained
,
all
our
goods
will
be
carried
off
.
<EOS>
As
faithful
subjects
of
his
Majesty
King
George
we
ought
to
be
protected
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
prevent
the
occupation
of
the
town
by
the
rebels
,
and
it
will
be
a
great
hardship
if
we
suffer
for
their
misdeeds
.
<EOS>
""You
must
address
yourselves
to
General
Wills
—
not
to
me
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Carpenter
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
had
the
conduct
of
the
siege
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
listen
to
the
appeal
,
"
remarked
Wills
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
By
the
rules
of
war
the
men
are
entitled
to
the
plunder
of
a
captured
town
,
and
I
shall
not
restrain
them
.
<EOS>
You
profess
fidelity
to
the
king
,
but
you
have
afforded
every
assistance
to
the
rebels
,
and
if
you
have
not
actually
taken
part
with
them
,
you
have
furnished
them
with
provisions
and
supplies
.
<EOS>
""We
were
forced
to
do
so
,
general
,
"
said
the
others
.
"
<EOS>
And
we
earnestly
beseech
you
to
spare
our
property
.
<EOS>
"Wills
<EOS>
,
however
,
refused
to
listen
to
them
,
and
they
departed
.
<EOS>
Thus
was
the
ill
-
fated
town
delivered
over
to
pillage
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
no
excesses
were
committed
by
the
soldiers
,
all
license
being
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
.
<EOS>
The
plunderers
commenced
with
the
shops
of
the
goldsmiths
,
silversmiths
,
and
jewellers
,
where
they
expected
to
find
the
greatest
quantity
of
valuables
.
<EOS>
These
shops
were
all
shut
up
,
but
were
quickly
broken
open
,
and
stripped
of
their
contents
—
plate
,
watches
,
rings
,
and
chains
being
carried
off
.
<EOS>
From
this
booty
alone
the
soldiers
obtained
several
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
They
next
entered
all
the
best
private
houses
in
Church
-
street
and
Fishergate
,
breaking
open
closets
and
chests
,
and
abstracting
all
the
plate
and
valuables
they
could
find
.
<EOS>
While
one
set
of
plunderers
were
thus
engaged
,
others
were
similarly
employed
in
different
parts
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
houses
were
ransacked
,
and
no
portable
article
was
left
behind
.
<EOS>
Not
till
a
late
hour
in
the
day
,
when
they
had
carried
off
all
they
could
,
did
the
soldiers
desist
from
the
work
.
<EOS>
Great
was
the
indignation
of
the
inhabitants
at
this
treatment
,
but
they
did
not
dare
to
resist
.
<EOS>
However
,
there
were
no
cases
of
intoxication
,
for
the
men
were
prevented
by
the
sergeants
and
corporals
from
breaking
open
the

But
it
was
a
woeful
day
for
Preston
,
and
such
as
its
inhabitants
never
thought
to
experience
.
<EOS>
Wills
's
severity
caused
him
to
be
held
in
universal
detestation
.
<EOS>
General
Carpenter
did
not
remain
long
in
the
town

<EOS>
Finding
it
inconveniently
crowded
,
he
set
out
for
Wigan
,
immediately
after
the
surrender
,
with
the
regiments
under
his
command
.
<EOS>
None
of
his
men
,
therefore
,
shared
in
the
plunder
—
nor
would
he
have
allowed
them
to
share
in
it

<EOS>
Without
counting
the
Government
troops
,
fifteen
hundred
and
fifty
prisoners
of
all
ranks
were
detained
within
the
town
.
<EOS>
Some
few
escapes
took
place
,
and
amongst
those
who
got
off
was
Tom
Syddall
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
he
was
afterwards
captured
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
days
'
detention
,
General
Forster
,
Lord
Derwentwater
,
Lord
Widdrington
,
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
the
Scottish
lords
and
chiefs
,
with
the
leading
Northumbrian
officers
,
were
sent
under
a
strong
guard
to
Wigan
on
the
way
to
London
.
<EOS>
Other
less
important
prisoners
were
sent
to
Lancaster
,
Chester
,
and
Liverpool
,
and
confined
in
the
jails
of
those
towns
.
<EOS>
Six
insurgent
officers
were
detained
at
Preston
,
and
subsequently
tried
by
court
-
martial
for
desertion
and
taking
up
arms
against
the
king
.
<EOS>
These
were
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
Captain
Dalziel
,
Major
Nairn
,
Captain
Philip
Lockhart
,
Ensign
Erskine
,
and
Captain
Shaftoe
.
<EOS>
The
lives
of
the
two
first
were
spared
,
but
the
others
were
condemned
to
be
shot
next
day
.
<EOS>
As
Captain
Shaftoe
was
a
great
favourite
in
Preston
,
his
sentence
caused
profound
grief
,
and
application
was
made
for
a
reprieve
,
but
General
Wills
refused
to
grant
it
unless
Shaftoe
would
acknowledge
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
rebellion
,
and
sue
for
mercy
from
King
George
.
<EOS>
Captain
Shaftoe
,
however
,
absolutely
refused
,
declaring
he
had
simply
done
his
duty
,
and
would
not
renounce
King
James
,
even
if
a
pardon
were
offered
him
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
at
an
early
hour
,
the
rebel
officers
were
taken
by
a
party
of
foot
soldiers
to
a
field
below
the
church
.
<EOS>
Among
the
spectators
,
were
some
young
women
,
whose
distressed
condition
touched
the
hearts
of
all
who
beheld
them
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
were
spent
by
the
rebel
officers
in
preparation
.
<EOS>
After
they
had
embraced
,
and
bade
each
other
farewell
,
Major
Nairn
came
forward
,
and
begged
of
the
officer
in
command
that
his
eyes
might
not
be
bandaged
,
and
that
he
himself
might
give
the
order
to
the
men
to
fire
.
<EOS>
Neither
request
was
accorded
.
<EOS>
Not
till
he
had
laid
Major
Nairn
in
his
coffin
,
with
his
own
hands
,
would
Captain
Lockhart
submit
to
his
fate
,
and
when
all
was
over
,
he
was
cared
for
as
anxiously
as
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Only
one
was
left
.
<EOS>
As
the
spectators
beheld
the
tall
handsome
figure
standing
erect
before
them
an
irrepressible
murmur
arose
.
<EOS>
Looking
around
,
Shaftoe
at
once
discovered
the
young
women
,
and
as
his
eye
settled
upon
one
of
them
he
called
out:"Do
not
forget
.
<EOS>
"A
white
kerchief
was
waved
in
reply
.
<EOS>
A
proud
smile
lighted
up
his
handsome
countenance
when
his
eyes
were
bound
,
and
<EOS>
his
last
words
,
distinctly
heard
by
all
were:"Long
live
King
James
the
Third
.
<EOS>
"Half
<EOS>
a
dozen
bullets
were
instantly
lodged
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
stood
erect
,
and
then
fell
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
,
whose
features
were
as
white
as
her
attire
,
stepped
quickly
forward
,
followed
by
two
others
,
and
motioning
back
the
soldiers
,
took
up
Shaftoe
's
body
and
placed
it
in
his
coffin
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
who
had
first
come
forward
,
and
who
was
no
other
than
Dryope
,
knelt
down
,
and
fixing
a
look
of
unalterable
affection
upon
her
dead
lover
,
kissed
his
brow
.
<EOS>
Placing
a
few
flowers
beside
him
,
she
then
arose
and
disappeared
with
her
companions
.
<EOS>
Thus
died
,
and
thus
was
mourned
,
one
of
the
most
gallant
gentlemen
of
the
rebel
army

THE
DUNGEONCHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
Chief
Insurgent
Prisoners
are
taken
to
LondonSORROWFUL
was
the
ride
of
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
from
Preston
to
Wigan
;
and
his
favourite
dapple
-
grey
steed
that
had
borne
him
throughout
the
campaign
,
seemed
to
share
his
despondency
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
weather
was
gloomy
,
and
in
accordance
with
the
earl
's
sombre
thoughts
.
<EOS>
And
,
truly
,
there
was
enough
to
make
him
sad
.
<EOS>
All
was
lost
.
<EOS>
All
his
great
estates
would
be
confiscated
,
and
the
journey
he
had
just
commenced
would
inevitably
end
in
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
To
add
poignancy
to
his
affliction
,
he
could
not
help
reflecting
how
different
the
result
might
have
been
,
but
for
Forster
's
deplorable
ignorance
and
obstinacy
,
and
though
he
acquitted
the
general
of
absolute
treachery
,
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
the
insurgent
army
was
entirely
sacrificed
by
him
.
<EOS>
These
thoughts
forced
themselves
upon
the
earl
as
he
crossed
the
Ribble
Bridge
,
and
did
not
leave
him
till
he
reached
Wigan
.
<EOS>
Here
Lord
Derwentwater
learnt
that
Forster
had
been
allowed
a
carriage
,
and
a
seat
was
offered
to
him
in
the
same
conveyance
,
but
he
declined
it
—
preferring
to
ride
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
Scottish
lords
would
travel
with
Forster
,
but
he
found
companions
in
his
chaplain
,
Mr.
Patten
,
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derwentwater
performed
the
whole
journey
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
From
Wigan
the
rebel
prisoners
were
conducted
to
Warrington
,
where
a
division
took
place
,
and
upwards
of
a
hundred
were
sent
on
to
London
,
guarded
by
several
detachments
of
horse
.
<EOS>
Amongst
these
prisoners
were
Sir
Francis
Anderton
,
Mr.
Townley
,
Mr.
Standish
,
Mr.
Tyldesley
,
and
other
Lancashire
gentlemen
who
had
joined
at
Preston
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
halt
at
Warrington
,
they
proceeded
by
slow
stages
to
Coventry
,
and
Lord
Derwentwater
in
some
degree
recovered
his
spirits
,
being
cheered
by
the
society
of
Sir
Francis
Anderton
and
Mr.
Townley
.
<EOS>
At
Coventry
,
the
escort
was
relieved
by
another
detachment
of
a
hundred
troopers
commanded
by
Brigadier
Ponton
,
by
whom
General
Forster
was
deprived
of
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
As
an
excuse
for
the
indignity
thus
offered
to
the
late
general
,
it
was
said
that
on
his
arrival
at
London
an
attempt
would
be
made
to
rescue
him
by
a
High
Church
Tory
mob
.
<EOS>
But
Forster
fell
ill
and
could
not
sit
his
horse
,
and
the
carriage
became
indispensable
.
<EOS>
At
Highgate
Major
General
Tatton
was
waiting
with
two
battalions
of
foot-
guards
to
take
charge
of
the
prisoners
who
were
consigned
to
him
,
and
without
consideration
to
rank
,
pinioned
.
<EOS>
Each
prisoner
's
horse
had
a
halter
placed
round
his
neck
,
and
was
led
by
a
grenadier
.
<EOS>
In
this
ignominious
manner
the
prisoners
were
conducted
in
four
separate
divisions
to
the
Tower
,
Newgate
,
the
Fleet
,
and
the
Marshalsea
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
,
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
the
Scottish
nobles
were
taken
to
the
state
prison
,
while
Forster
,
to
his
great
mortification
,
was
lodged
with
the
others
in
Newgate
.
<EOS>
Drums
were
beaten
loudly
as
the
unfortunate
captives
were
taken
through
the
streets
,
exposed
to
the
insults
and
derision
of
the
populace
,
and
in
some
cases
seriously
injured
by
the
numerous
missiles
hurled
at
them
.
<EOS>
Incessant
cries
resounded
on
all
sides
of
"
No
Popish
Pretender
!
"
<EOS>
"
Down
with
the
rebels
!
"
<EOS>
"
Long
live
King
George
!
"
<EOS>
But
not
a
single
voice
shouted
"
Long
live
King
James!"The
composure
and
dignity
of
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
combined
with
his
remarkable
good
looks
,
could
not
fail
to
produce
a
favourable
impression
upon
the
spectators
;
but
quite
a
sensation
was
caused
by
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
whose
gigantic
figure
and
stern
looks
completely
bore
out
all
the
descriptions
that
had
been
given
of
him
.
<EOS>
The
old
warrior
had
been
allowed
to
walk
,
so
that
his
muscular
frame
could
be
fully
seen
,
and
though
his
arms
were
pinioned
,
his
aspect
was
so
terrible
that
none
dared
insult
him
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIThe
Earl
of
Derwentwater
is
imprisoned
in
the
Devereux
TowerTHE
rebel
lords
were
confined
in
different
prison
lodgings
in
the
Tower
,
but
were
not
treated
with
any
sort
of
rigour
,
being
allowed
by
the
Lieutenant
to
visit
each
other
,
when
accompanied
by
a
guard
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derwentwater
had
a
large
chamber
on
the
upper
story
of
the
Devereux
Tower
,
with
a
cell
connected
with
it
,
wherein
he
slept
,
and
he
passed
his
time
wholly
in
reading
and
devotional
exercises
.
<EOS>
Thus
his
mind
,
greatly
troubled
at
first
,
became
gradually
tranquillised
.
<EOS>
The
earl
had
been
imprisoned
for
nearly
a
fortnight
when
the
countess
,
to
whom
he
had
written
,
praying
her
to
come
to
him
,
arrived
in
London
.
<EOS>
She
was
accompanied
by
Dorothy
Forster
,
who
hoped
to
be
useful
to
her
brother
,
and
was
likewise
attended
by
Father
Norman
and
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
Without
difficulty
Lady
Derwentwater
obtained
an
order
to
visit
her
consort
in
the
Tower
,
and
was
furthermore
permitted
to
bring
Father
Norman
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
sad
meeting
,
but
the
frame
of
mind
attained
by
the
earl
enabled
him
to
support
it
,
and
to
offer
the
countess
consolation
.
<EOS>
Though
scarcely
indulging
a
hope
,
Lord
Derwentwater
was
not
unwilling
that
every
effort
should
be
made
to
obtain
a
pardon
for
him
,
for
he
could
not
deny
,
when
gazing
at
the
countess
,
that
life
was
still
dear
to
him
.
<EOS>
Father
Norman
,
however
,
who
feared
the
worst
,
urged
him
to
wean
his
heart
as
much
as
possible
from
earth
,
and
fix
it
upon
heaven
.
<EOS>
This
the
earl
earnestly
strove
to
do
,
and
he
was
greatly
assisted
by
the
good
priest
.
<EOS>
His
life
had
always
been
devout
,
and
now
he
felt
the
inexpressible
comfort
derived
from
religious
observances
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
countess
was
using
all
her
efforts
to
procure
her
husband
a
pardon
,
but
she
was
deterred
from
applying
in
the
highest
quarter
,
being
informed
that
the
king
was
greatly
incensed
against
the
rebel
lords
,
and
would
not
listen
to
her
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
the
meeting
of
Parliament
,
General
Forster
was
expelled
from
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
the
English
and
Scottish
noblemen
concerned
in
the
rebellion
were
impeached
of
high
treason
.
<EOS>
All
pleaded
guilty
,
except
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
who
petitioned
for
a
delay
.
<EOS>
They
were
next
conveyed
by
water
from
the
Tower
to
Westminster
Hall
,
and
being
brought
into
the
court
,
presided
over
by
Lord
Chancellor
Cowper
,
as
Lord
High
Steward
,
received
sentence
of
death
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
the
noble
prisoners
conducted
themselves
with
great
firmness
and
dignity
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
crowd
insult
them
as
they
were
taken
back
to
the
barge
.
<EOS>
Many
spectators
indeed
regarded
them
with
sympathy
,
but
did
not
dare
to
make
any
demonstration
in
their
favour
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
of
Derwentwater
no
longer
hesitated
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
the
Duchesses
of
Cleveland
and
Bolton
,
and
several
other
ladies
of
the
highest
rank
,
she
was
introduced
by
the
Dukes
of
Richmond
and
St.
Albans
into
the
king
's
bedchamber
,
and
flinging
herself
at
his
majesty
's
feet
,
addressed
him
in
French
,
imploring
his
clemency
for
her
husband
.
<EOS>
The
king
raised
her
immediately
,
and
said
in
an
inflexible
voice:"What
has
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
done
to
merit
clemency
on
my
part
?
<EOS>
He
has
been
guilty
of
a
most
heinous
treason
.
<EOS>
He
has
set
up
a
Popish
Pretender
.
<EOS>
He
has
raised
my
subjects
in
rebellion
—
has
made
war
against
me
—
and
now
that
he
is
vanquished
,
he
sues
humbly
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
I
cannot
—
will
not
pardon
him
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
him
as
the
guiltiest
of
the
rebel
lords
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
say
not
so
,
my
liege
!
"
<EOS>
supplicated
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
His
nature
is
loyal
and
generous
.
<EOS>
""He
has
not
proved
loyal
to
me
,
"
cried
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
traitor
—
a
vile
traitor
—
and
I
will
not
pardon
him
.
<EOS>
No
more
,
madame
!
<EOS>
You
plead
in
vain
.
<EOS>
I
pity
you
—
but
I
can
not
help
you
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derwentwater
must
die
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
she
still
continued
to
clasp
his
hand
,
and
bathe
it
with
her
tears
,
the
king
signed
to
the
Duke
of
Richmond
,
who
raised
her
and
took
her
away
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
only
effort
made
by
the
unhappy
countess
.
<EOS>
She
subsequently
went
to
the
lobby
of
the
House
of
Peers
,
accompanied
by
the
Countess
of
Nithsdale
,
Lady
Nairn
,
and
many
other
ladies
of
distinction
,
but
their
petition
was
refused
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
of
Derwentwater
was
filled
with
despair
when
she
had
to
communicate
this
sad
news
to
the
earl
,
but
he
bore
it
firmly
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
sorry
you
knelt
to
the
usurper
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
am
the
guiltiest
of
all
the
insurgent
lords
in
his
eyes
,
because
I
am
most
attached
to
King
James
,
and
because
King
James
is
most
attached
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
promised
too
much
for
me
,
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
sworn
allegiance
to
the
Hanoverian
usurper
,
and
never
will
.
<EOS>
I
might
engage
not
to
conspire
against
him
,
but
I
refuse
to
serve
him
.
<EOS>
""What
is
to
be
done
?
"
cried
the
countess
,
despairingly
.
"Nothing
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
forbid
you
to
make
any
further
appeal
to
the
tyrant
.
<EOS>
My
death
is
resolved
on
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
think
otherwise
,
daughter
,
"
observed
Father
Norman
,
who
was
present
.
<EOS>
"Perhaps
<EOS>
your
escape
may
be
accomplished
?
"
cried
the
countess
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"That
is
wholly
different
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
aid
in
my
deliverance
,
I
shall
rejoice
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
the
attempt
will
not
be
successful
.
<EOS>
""Wherefore
<EOS>
not
?
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
I
believe
that
my
destiny
is
otherwise
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
"Yield
<EOS>
not
to
such
fancies
,
my
son
,
"
said
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"
Nor
let
any
scruple
hinder
you
from
freeing
yourself
,
if
you
can
,
from
the
tyrant
's
power
.
<EOS>
Break
his
bonds
I
counsel
you
,
and
escape
from
captivity
and
death
.
<EOS>
You
may
still
be
able
to
serve
King
James
,
and
the
great
services
you
have
rendered
him
,
and
the
sacrifices
you
have
made
for
him
,
may
be
rewarded
.
<EOS>
""Whatever
is
done
,
must
be
done
quickly
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
time
approaches
when
escape
will
no
longer
be
possible
—
unless
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
strange
smile
,
"
I
could
walk
,
like
Saint
Denis
,
with
my
head
off
.
"Though
<EOS>
the
earl
never
quitted
the
Devereux
Tower
except
for
the
scaffold
,
two
remarkable
escapes
occurred
from
adjoining
fortifications
,
to
which
we
shall
refer
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIIThe
Earl
of
Nithsdale
's
EscapeHAVING
vainly
solicited
a
pardon
for
her
husband
,
the
Countess
of
Nithsdale
,
a
woman
of
great
courage
,
as
well
as
of
great
personal
attractions
,
resolved
to
make
an
attempt
to
liberate
him
.
<EOS>
Before
putting
her
project
in
execution
she
found
a
place
of
refuge
,
where
the
earl
might
remain
safely
concealed
till
he
could
embark
for
France
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
on
the
last
day
it
was
thought
he
had
to
live
<EOS>
,
she
drove
to
the
Tower
gate
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
dismissed
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
She
was
accompanied
by
two
female
attendants
,
and
seemed
so
utterly
prostrated
by
grief
,
that
she
needed
their
assistance
.
<EOS>
Her
attendants
wore
hoods
and
cloaks
,
but
not
in
such
a
manner
as
to
appear
like
a
disguise
.
<EOS>
The
earl
was
confined
in
a
distant
fortification
situated
in
the
north
-
west
angle
of
the
inner
ward
,
and
it
seemed
certain
that
the
countess
would
never
have
got
there
without
support
.
<EOS>
A
sentinel
was
stationed
at
the
entrance
of
the
prison
-
lodging
,
but
as
the
party
were
preceded
by
a
jailer
they
passed
without
question
.
<EOS>
When
the
massive
door
of
his
prison
-
chamber
was
unlocked
,
Lord
Nithsdale
came
forth
from
a
small
inner
room
,
or
cell
,
and
perceiving
his
wife
uttered
a
cry
,
and
clasped
her
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
jailer
who
was
stationed
outside
,
was
summoned
by
one
of
the
female
attendants
.
<EOS>
She
told
him
her
services
were
no
longer
required
,
and
after
a
very
slight
scrutiny
he
suffered
her
to
depart
.
<EOS>
But
this
active
confidante
had
stayed
long
enough
to
divest
herself
of
an
additional
dress
with
which
she
was
provided
.
<EOS>
This
dress
was
meant
as
a
disguise
for
the
earl
,
while
it
was
intended
that
her
fellow
-
servant
should
personate
the
afflicted
countess
.
<EOS>
The
exchanges
of
attire
were
quickly
made
.
<EOS>
The
earl
,
whose
slight
figure
and
small
stature
suited
the
part
he
had
to
play
,
was
transformed
into
a
lady
's
maid
;
and
the
representative
of
the
countess
was
duly
prepared
for
the
part
she
had
to
enact
.
<EOS>
All
was
now
ready
,
but
it
was
deemed
prudent
to
wait
nearly
an
hour
,
and
it
will
be
guessed
what
anxiety
was
felt
in
the
interval
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
jailer
was
called
.
<EOS>
On
unlocking
the
door
,
he
beheld
the
earl
as
he
thought
,
in
an
attitude
of
despair
,
leaning
on
the
table
,
with
his
face
covered
by
his
hands
.
<EOS>
The
unhappy
countess
was
overwhelmed
by
grief
,
and
had
to
be
led
forth
by
her
attendant
,
who
was
muffled
up
in
her
hood
to
hide
her
own
tears
.
<EOS>
The
jailer
's
stony
heart
was
touched
by
so
much
grief
.
<EOS>
He
let
them
out
without
a
word
,
fastened
the
door
,
and
following
them
down
the
circular
stone
steps
,
offered
in
a
kindly
tone
to
conduct
them
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
The
countess
murmured
her
thanks
,
and
the
man
marched
on
before
them
,
and
saved
them
from
any
interference
,
receiving
a
piece
of
gold
for
his
pains
,
when
he
left
them
at
the
Bulwark
Gate
.
<EOS>
"Tell
your
lady
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
to
the
attendant
,
who
gave
him
the
gratuity
,
"
that
I
will
do
all
I
can
for
his
lordship
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"He
would
have
called
a
coach
,
but
they
took
a
boat
,
and
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
first
person
to
enter
the
prison
-
chamber
after
the
earl
's
flight
was
the
Lieutenant
of
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
He
was
filled
with
consternation
on
perceiving
that
its
sole
occupant
was
a
very
handsome
woman
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Countess
of
Nithsdale
here
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
earl
then
has
escaped?""Solely
by
my
connivance
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
No
one
here
has
been
concerned
in
the
flight
.
<EOS>
""That
remains
to
be
ascertained
,
"
rejoined
the
Lieutenant
.
"
<EOS>
But
your
ladyship
's
life
will
be
responsible
for
that
of
your
husband
.
<EOS>
""My
husband
is
safe
,
and
that
is
enough
for
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
countess
,
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
he
may
be
recaptured
,
"
said
the
Lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"I
have
no
uneasiness
on
that
score
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
My
precautions
have
been
too
well
taken
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
must
detain
your
ladyship
,
"
said
the
Lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
know
not
what
course
may
be
pursued
;
but
I
will
frankly
own
that
I
hope
you
may
be
able
to
rejoin
your
lord
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
good
wish
was
eventually
fulfilled
.

CHAPTER
IVThe
Earl
of
Wintoun
's
EscapeANOTHER
important
escape
must
be
recounted
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
the
noble
fugitive
was
indebted
entirely
to
his
own
exertions
for
deliverance
.
<EOS>
The
youth
of
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
was
passed
in
a
manner
that
might
have
given
him
extraordinary
notoriety
in
our
own
time
;
but
though
he
ran
away
to
France
,
and
disappeared
for
some
years
,
his
claim
to
the
title
was
never
disputed
.
<EOS>
Incredible
as
it
may
seem
,
during
this
period
of
his
career
,
he
hired
himself
to
a
blacksmith
,
and
served
as
a
mere
bellows
-
blower
for
some
years
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
acquired
considerable
mechanical
skill
,
which
was
subsequently
improved
,
when
he
abandoned
the
hammer
and
the
forge
,
and
his
talent
now
stood
him
in
good
stead
.
<EOS>
He
was
imprisoned
in
the
upper
part
of
the
Hall
Tower
,
formerly
,
as
its
name
imported
,
connected
with
the
old
palace
,
and
the
windows
of
his
rooms
looked
into
the
inner
and
outer
wards
.
<EOS>
These
windows
were
strongly
grated
,
but
Lord
Wintoun
derided
this
obstacle
to
escape
.
<EOS>
Carefully
concealed
about
his
person
,
he
had
a
couple
of
small
files
,
and
setting
to
work
with
these
implements
,
he
so
nearly
cut
through
the
bars
,
that
he
could
immediately
remove
them
when
needful
.
<EOS>
The
main
difficulty
was
now
overcome
,
but
the
windows
were
at
a
considerable
height
from
the
ground
;
and
,
moreover
,
there
were
sentinels
both
at
the
back
and
front
,
who
must
be
eluded
before
an
escape
could
be
effected
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
however
,
was
confident
in
his
own
ability
to
manage
the
matter
,
and
did
not
doubt
he
should
find
an
opportunity
of
getting
off
.
<EOS>
The
opportunity
occurred
.
<EOS>
During
the
day
a
fog
had
prevailed
in
the
City
,
and
of
course
extended
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
thicker
there
than
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Towards
night
the
vapour
increased
in
density
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
the
White
Tower
completely
hidden
,
but
all
the
surrounding
buildings
were
obscured
.
<EOS>
The
sentinels
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
on
their
posts
.
<EOS>
Links
were
lighted
,
but
only
served
to
make
the
darkness
more
palpable
.
<EOS>
When
the
fog
first
came
on
,
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
the
chance
thus
offered
him
,
but
he
waited
patiently
till
night
.
<EOS>
No
extra
precaution
seemed
to
be
taken
by
the
jailers
,
except
that
the
entrance
to
the
Hall
Tower
from
the
inner
ward
was
fastened
,
but
this
mattered
little
,
since
the
fugitive
proposed
to
descend
from
the
window
looking
towards
the
outer
ward
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
the
jailer
paid
his
last
visit
for
the
night
than
the
earl
removed
the
bars
from
the
window
,
tied
a
couple
of
sheets
together
and
fastened
them
,
and
then
listened
intently
for
the
sound
of
the
sentinel
's
footsteps
,
who
was
pacing
to
and
fro
beneath
.
<EOS>
So
dark
was
it
that
Lord
Wintoun
could
not
see
the
man
,
but
he
could
hear
him
,
and
when
he
judged
by
the
sound
that
the
sentinel
was
at
the
greatest
distance
,
he
let
himself
down
as
quickly
and
noiselessly
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
A
sound
reached
the
man
's
ear
,
for
he
suddenly
halted
,
and
called
out
,
"
<EOS>
Who
goes
there?"But
receiving
no
answer
,
and
hearing
no
further
noise
,
he
did
not
think
it
needful
to
give
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
who
had
remained
perfectly
quiet
at
this
critical
juncture
,
now
stole
to
the
further
side
of
the
ward
,
and
crept
along
the
edge
of
the
wall
till
he
got
within
a
short
distance
of
the
Gate
Tower
.
<EOS>
Here
fortune
favoured
him
.
<EOS>
At
the
very
moment
of
his
arrival
,
a
warder
who
had
just
come
from
the
guard-
room
was
opening
the
wicket
to
let
out
some
half
-
dozen
persons
.
<EOS>
Without
hesitation
,
the
earl
mixed
with
the
party
,
and
though
a
link
was
brought
,
he
escaped
without
attracting
the
warder
's
attention
.
<EOS>
But
another
portal
had
still
to
be
passed
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
bridge
,
and
as
Lord
Wintoun
was
marching
towards
it
with
his
companions
,
he
felt
his
arm
grasped
,
while
a
voice
whispered
in
his
ear:"You
are
one
of
the
rebel
lords
.
<EOS>
Your
life
is
worth
a
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
that
sum
,
or
I
will
prevent
your
escape
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
the
money
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
in
the
same
tone
.
"Enough
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
fulfil
your
promise
.
<EOS>
Take
that
letter
.
<EOS>
It
will
tell
you
who
I
am
.
"But
<EOS>
for
this
timely
aid
the
earl
might
have
been
stopped
by
the
guard
at
the
Middle
Tower
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
soon
got
clear
of
the
fortress
,
and
passing
through
the
Bulwark
Gate
,
plunged
into
the
fog
that
enveloped
Tower
Hill
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VGeneral
Forster
's
Escape
from
NewgateA
VERY
jovial
time
the
prisoners
in
Newgate
had
of
it
.
<EOS>
Supplied
with
plenty
of
money
by
their
friends
,
they
could
obtain
whatever
they
wanted
;
and
better
wine
and
better
punch
were
drunk
in
Newgate
than
at
any
tavern
in
town
.
<EOS>
The
prison
,
indeed
,
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
large
inn
,
where
the
numerous
guests
were
feasting
and
carousing
from
morning
till
night
.
<EOS>
The
majority
of
the
prisoners
persuaded
themselves
that
in
consequence
of
their
surrender
they
should
be
very
leniently
treated
,
but
come
what
might
,
they
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
Ordinarily
a
sort
of
barrack
,
called
the
King
's
Bench
Ward
,
was
occupied
by
debtors
,
but
in
consequence
of
the
excessively
crowded
state
of
the
jail
,
this
large
chamber
,
which
was
partitioned
off
for
beds
,
served
as
a
dormitory
for
a
portion
of
the
rebels
,
while
they
dined
,
supped
,
drank
punch
,
smoked
pipes
,
played
cards
,
dice
,
and
draughts
,
in
the
Debtor
's
Hall
.
<EOS>
Driven
from
their
quarters
,
the
luckless
debtors
took
refuge
on
the
felons
'
side
or
in
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
Private
bed
-
chambers
,
and
small
private
apartments
,
for
which
enormous
fees
were
demanded
by
the
governor
,
Mr.
Pitts
,
were
provided
for
some
of
the
insurgent
leaders
.
<EOS>
The
best
bedroom
in
the
prison
,
which
had
formerly
been
occupied
by
Lord
Russell
and
Count
Koningsmark
,
and
more
recently
by
Count
Guiscard
,
was
let
to
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
were
each
furnished
with
a
good
room
,
but
Brigadier
Mackintosh
did
not
care
how
he
was
accommodated
.
<EOS>
The
chief
officers
had
their
own
mess
-
table
,
at
which
they
were
very
well
served
,
and
friends
constantly
dined
with
them
.
<EOS>
The
prison
,
indeed
,
was
as
full
of
visitors
as
inmates
,
and
the
prisoners
were
just
as
cheerful
as
their
guests
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
sympathy
was
felt
for
the
unfortunate
Jacobite
gentlemen
by
the
fair
sex
,
who
flocked
to
Newgate
to
express
it
.
<EOS>
The
prisoners
were
highly
gratified
by
their
attention
,
and
exceedingly
delighted
to
see
them
,
and
the
lodge
was
so
beset
by
sedan
-
chairs
and
coaches
,
and
so
thronged
by
ladies
in
fine
dresses
and
loo
-
masks
that
it
looked
more
like
the
entrance
to
a
masquerade
than
the
approach
to
a
gloomy
dungeon
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
reverses
,
and
though
he
was
severely
censured
by
his
own
party
,
General
Forster
maintained
his
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
On
Dorothy
's
arrival
in
town
he
was
constantly
visited
by
her
,
and
it
is
probable
<EOS>
she
suggested
a
plan
of
escape
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
certain
she
brought
him
a
large
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
How
it
was
employed
can
only
be
conjectured
,
though
we
do
not
think
we
shall
be
far
wrong
in
asserting
that
a
considerable
portion
of
it
found
its
way
into
the
pockets
of
Mr.
Pitts
.
<EOS>
By
whatever
means
he
procured
them
,
and
,
as
we
have
intimated
,
suspicion
attached
to
the
governor
,
Forster
obtained
false
keys
,
and
they
were
successfully
employed
by
him
immediately
after
a
bill
of
high
treason
had
been
found
against
him
.
<EOS>
The
comedy
,
it
must
be
owned
,
was
well
played
.
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
his
evasion
,
Forster
invited
Sir
Francis
Anderton
,
who
was
likewise
a
prisoner
in
Newgate
,
to
sup
with
him
,
and
they
sat
together
carousing
to
a
late
hour
.
<EOS>
They
were
still
enjoying
themselves
when
the
governor
came
in
to
remind
them
that
it
was
not
far
from
midnight
.
<EOS>
Forster
begged
him
to
sit
down
,
as
he
wished
him
to
taste
some
very
fine
old
brandy
,
and
stepped
into
the
adjoining
chamber
to
fetch
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
Apparently
he
could
not
find
what
he
sought
,
for
he
did
not
immediately
return
,
and
the
governor
,
feigning
to
become
alarmed
,
went
to
look
after
him
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
was
gone
,
and
had
evidently
made
his
exit
by
the
door
communicating
with
the
passage
,
which
ought
to
have
been
locked
outside
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
was
locked
,
as
was
the
door
of
the
other
room
,
for
when
the
governor
hurried
thither
,
and
tried
to
get
out
,
he
found
himself
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
consternation
into
which
Mr.
Pitts
was
thrown
by
this
discovery
,
if
not
real
,
was
extremely
well
simulated
,
and
imposed
upon
Sir
Francis
Anderton
,
who
,
however
,
laughed
very
heartily
.
<EOS>
The
governor
knocked
against
the
door
,
and
shouted
loudly
for
assistance
,
but
some
minutes
elapsed
before
the
turnkey
came
,
and
then
it
was
found
that
a
double
-
lock
had
been
placed
outside
.
<EOS>
Search
was
made
for
the
fugitive
,
but
no
traces
whatever
could
be
found
of
him
.
<EOS>
Every
door
through
which
he
had
to
pass
had
been
unlocked
and
re
-
fastened
,
and
if
their
statements
were
to
be
credited
,
not
one
of
the
turnkeys
had
seen
him
pass
out
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
How
he
got
through
the
lodge
—
how
he
passed
the
usually
vigilant
porter
at
the
gate
—
has
never
been
satisfactorily
<EOS>
explained!But
<EOS>
it
is
certain
he
proceeded
to
Blackfriars
,
where
he
found
Dorothy
waiting
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
hired
a
boat
for
Gravesend
,
whence
her
brother
embarked
before
dawn
for
France
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
,
however
,
did
not
accompany
him
in
his
flight
.
<EOS>
A
reward
of
one
thousand
pounds
was
immediately
offered
for
Forster
's
apprehension
,
but
he
was
safe
on
the
other
side
of
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Pitts
was
tried
for
his
life
at
the
Old
Bailey
for
conniving
at
Forster
's
escape
,
but
was
acquitted
.

CHAPTER
VIBrigadier
Mackintosh
's
EscapeOWING
to
his
prodigious
strength
and
daring
Brigadier
Mackintosh
was
more
feared
than
any
other
of
the
rebels
confined
in
Newgate
,
and
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
place
him
in
irons
.
<EOS>
Highly
indignant
at
such
treatment
,
he
complained
of
it
in
the
strongest
terms
to
the
governor
,
but
was
told
it
was
done
by
the
express
order
of
Lord
Townshend
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
lordship
wishes
to
inflict
a
disgrace
upon
me
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
he
simply
dishonours
himself
by
treating
a
Highland
commander
like
a
common
felon
.
<EOS>
Tell
his
lordship
his
contemptible
fetters
will
not
prevent
my
escape
.
"After
<EOS>
Forster
's
escape
,
which
had
caused
an
extraordinary
sensation
throughout
London
,
the
vigilance
of
the
jailers
was
doubled
,
and
Brigadier
Mackintosh
delayed
the
execution
of
the
daring
project
he
had
conceived
till
the
latest
moment
.
<EOS>
Not
till
the
night
before
his
trial
was
fixed
to
take
place
at
Westminster
Hall
did
he
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Already
he
had
partly
sawn
through
the
hateful
fetters
,
so
that
he
could
cast
them
off
in
a
moment
,
and
they
were
now
rather
advantageous
to
him
than
otherwise
,
as
they
procured
him
greater
freedom
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Mackintosh
,
who
was
likewise
a
prisoner
,
Charles
Wogan
,
Robert
Hepburn
of
Keith
,
with
several
others
,
chiefly
Scotsmen
,
were
to
be
partners
in
the
flight
,
but
the
entire
conduct
of
the
enterprise
was
left
to
the
brigadier
himself
.
<EOS>
About
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
Mackintosh
,
having
freed
himself
from
his
irons
,
cautiously
descended
the
stairs
leading
from
the
upper
ward
to
the
press-
yard
,
and
stationed
himself
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
friends
remained
in
the
dormitory
,
but
were
ready
to
join
him
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
the
door
was
unlocked
as
he
expected
it
would
be
,
by
the
governor
's
black
servant
,
Caliban
,
bearing
a
lantern
.
<EOS>
Caliban
was
a
powerful
fellow
,
but
no
match
for
the
brigadier
,
who
seized
him
by
the
throat
with
a
gripe
like
that
of
a
vice
,
and
hurled
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
cries
of
the
half
-
strangled
black
brought
the
governor
,
and
Mr.
Ballard
,
the
head
turnkey
,
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
They
were
struck
with
amazement
at
seeing
the
brigadier
,
but
did
not
dare
to
grapple
with
him
,
now
that
he
was
free
from
his
irons
.
<EOS>
Leaving
them
to
be
dealt
with
by
his
followers
,
who
were
now
thronging
the
press
-
room
,
the
brigadier
hurried
on
—
his
object
being
to
disarm
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
Before
the
man
could
raise
the
musket
to
his
shoulder
,
Mackintosh
sprang
upon
him
like
a
tiger
,
and
forced
the
weapon
from
his
grasp
,
while
young
Hepburn
pinioned
the
man
's
arms
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Ballard
had
been
deprived
of
his
keys
,
and
he
and
Mr.
Pitts
were
thrust
through
the
door
leading
to
the
staircase
from
the
press
-
room
,
and
locked
out
.
<EOS>
The
porter
in
the
lodge
alone
remained
—
at
least
,
it
was
thought
so
by
the
fugitives
—
but
he
chanced
to
have
a
watchman
with
him
at
the
time
,
and
this
gossipping
guardian
of
the
night
,
hearing
the
disturbance
,
endeavoured
to
rush
out
and
spring
his
rattle
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
caught
and
deprived
of
his
coat
,
lantern
,
and
hat
by
the
brigadier
,
who
thought
the
disguise
might
prove
serviceable
to
some
of
his
followers
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
the
fugitives
were
out
in
the
street
,
which
was
fortunately
quite
deserted
at
the
time
,
and
the
lodge
gate
being
locked
outside
,
immediate
pursuit
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
Bidding
each
other
a
hasty
farewell
,
the
fugitives
then
separated
,
each
seeking
the
asylum
which
he
knew
had
been
provided
for
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
was
uncertain
where
to
go
,
when
a
light
in
a
window
at
that
late
hour
attracted
his
attention
,
and
he
perceived
an
antique
silver
tankard
of
peculiar
shape
,
which
he
knew
belonged
to
his
family
.
<EOS>
Without
hesitation
he
entered
the
house
and
found
his
wife
,
who
had
placed
the
cup
in
the
window
,
hoping
it
might
catch
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Forster
's
flight
from
Newgate
was
completely
eclipsed
by
that
of
Brigadier
Mackintosh
and
his
companions
.
<EOS>
That
the
first
escape
had
been
effected
by
bribery
,
very
few
persons
doubted
;
but
this
was
a
bold
dashing
affair
,
well
calculated
to
excite
public
admiration
,
and
nothing
else
was
talked
about
for
a
few
days
.
<EOS>
As
previously
mentioned
,
the
trial
of
the
rebels
was
to
have
taken
place
in
Westminster
Hall
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
The
court
and
juries
met
,
but
—
but
not
till
life
was
extinct
,
he
was
drawn
and
quartered
,
and
his
head
fixed
on
the
market
cross
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
punishment
inflicted
upon
all
the
rebels
of
lower
rank
,
who
were
not
transported
to
the
colonies
.

THE
SCAFFOLDCHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
last
Parting
between
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
the
CountessTHE
last
sad
parting
between
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
the
countess
must
now
be
detailed
.
<EOS>
The
interview
took
place
in
the
prison
-
chamber
in
the
Devereux
Tower
,
and
on
the
day
before
the
execution
.
<EOS>
After
his
condemnation
,
the
earl
had
passed
most
of
his
time
in
prayer
,
and
had
so
completely
succeeded
in
reconciling
himself
to
his
fate
,
that
he
forbade
the
countess
to
make
any
further
efforts
for
his
deliverance
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
after
the
escapes
that
had
taken
place
,
any
fresh
attempt
would
have
been
futile
.
<EOS>
The
unhappy
countess
was
staying
at
Dagenham
Park
,
an
old
manorial
mansion
,
near
Romford
in
Essex
,
belonging
to
a
Roman
Catholic
family
,
and
she
came
over
every
day
to
the
Tower
,
accompanied
by
Father
Norman
,
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Latterly
,
permission
had
been
refused
her
,
but
,
on
the
day
before
the
execution
,
she
was
allowed
to
visit
him
with
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Not
having
seen
him
for
a
few
days
,
she
was
much
struck
by
the
change
in
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
had
a
very
serene
expression
.
<EOS>
All
trouble
had
vanished
from
it
,
and
it
was
plain
from
his
looks
that
his
thoughts
were
fixed
on
high
.
<EOS>
"You
have
no
longer
any
fear
of
death
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
,
my
son
,
"
said
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"I
have
no
desire
for
life
,
father
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
better
prepared
to
die
than
I
might
be
at
a
future
time
,
were
my
days
prolonged
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
soon
rejoin
you
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
live!—I
would
have
you
live
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
young
,
beautiful
—
and
I
trust
have
many
years
of
happiness
before
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
them
abridged
.
<EOS>
But
think
of
me
always
<EOS>
—
think
how
fondly
I
have
loved
you
—
think
how
entirely
happy
I
have
been
in
your
society
.
<EOS>
Never
for
a
single
moment
has
my
heart
swerved
from
its
devotion
to
you
.
<EOS>
Fate
has
separated
us
for
a
time
—
but
it
was
against
my
will
.
<EOS>
My
love
has
been
sacrificed
to
my
sense
of
duty
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
,
my
dearest
lord
,
"
she
cried
,
with
a
look
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
how
bitterly
I
reproach
myself
that
I
urged
you
to
join
this
fatal
expedition
.
<EOS>
Would
I
could
recall
the
past
!
<EOS>
Would
we
could
be
at
Dilston
together
as
in
former
days
!
<EOS>
Never
!
<EOS>
never
should
you
leave
it
!
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
speak
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
it
does
not
pain
me
,
"
said
the
earl
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
quit
this
dungeon
for
a
moment
in
thought
,
and
transport
ourselves
to
Dilston
.
<EOS>
Let
us
stand
together
—
as
we
have
so
often
stood
—
upon
the
terrace
,
and
gaze
upon
the
far-
spreading
prospect
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
scene
rises
before
me
,
as
I
speak
!
<EOS>
We
are
in
the
glen
,
wandering
by
the
side
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
We
are
in
the
forest
,
and
I
enter
the
Maiden
's
Walk
,
and
receive
a
warning
.
<EOS>
""What
more
?
"
cried
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
The
vision
has
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
my
sweet
love
,
Dilston
will
be
yours
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
house
you
have
brightened
with
your
presence
will
be
taken
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bequeath
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
should
wish
to
be
laid
with
my
fathers
in
the
vault
beneath
the
little
chapel
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
,
my
dearest
lord
,
"
she
cried
,
earnestly
.
"
<EOS>
Your
wishes
shall
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
think
that
resting
-
place
will
be
denied
me
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
no
fear
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
"
The
malice
of
your
enemies
will
not
extend
to
that
length
.
<EOS>
All
shall
be
done
as
you
desire
.
<EOS>
When
the
tragedy
is
over
,
the
body
shall
be
conveyed
by
slow
stages
—
and
only
by
night
—
to
Dilston
.
<EOS>
During
the
day
it
shall
rest
in
some
Catholic
chapel
,
and
masses
shall
be
said
.
<EOS>
""I
will
accompany
it
,
and
see
the
last
sad
rites
performed
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
give
me
inexpressible
comfort
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
sole
request
I
had
to
prefer
.
<EOS>
"Shortly
<EOS>
afterwards
the
earl
retired
with
Father
Norman
into
the
cell
adjoining
the
prison
-
chamber
,
where
the
priest
heard
his
confession
,
and
gave
him
absolution
.
<EOS>
During
this
interval
,
the
countess
knelt
down
and
prayed
fervently
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
earl
came
forth
,
and
she
arose
,
perceiving
from
his
looks
that
the
moment
of
parting
was
come
.
<EOS>
He
extended
his
arms
,
and
flying
towards
him
,
she
was
clasped
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Thus
they
remained
for
some
minutes
amid
a
silence
,
broken
only
by
her
sobs
.
<EOS>
He
then
made
a
slight
effort
to
loosen
her
embrace
,
but
she
clung
to
him
even
more
tenaciously
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
must
part
,
my
best
beloved
,
"
he
said
,
printing
a
kiss
upon
her
brow
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
I
knew
not
the
anguish
of
this
hour
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Would
my
heart
would
break
and
relieve
me!""For
your
husband
's
sake
,
calm
yourself
,
dear
daughter
,
I
implore
you
!
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
But
her
grief
was
too
violent
to
be
restrained
,
and
a
paroxysm
ensued
that
found
vent
in
a
fearful
shriek
,
that
burst
through
the
grated
windows
of
the
fortification
,
and
almost
froze
the
blood
of
such
as
heard
it
.
<EOS>
She
then
became
insensible
.
<EOS>
On
regaining
consciousness
,
she
no
longer
beheld
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
had
parted
from
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
carefully
removed
to
the
Lieutenant
's
lodgings
,
where
restoratives
were
applied
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
her
strength
permitted
,
she
left
the
Tower
with
Father
Norman
,
and
returned
to
Dagenham
Park
;
feeling
as
if
her
heart
were
broken
.

Lord
Widdrington
took

Leave

<EOS>
was
the
morn
,
and
in
unison
with
the
sombre
deed
about
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
Already
a
scaffold
,
draped
in
black
,
on
which
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Kenmure
were
to
pay
the
forfeit
of
their
lives

had
been
erected
on
Tower-

At
an
early
hour
three
strong

Guards
marched
from
Whitehall
,
and
posted
themselves
round
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
a
crowd
of
curious
observers
of
both
sexes
began
to
assemble
,
and
increased
so
rapidly
that
within
an
hour
the
whole
summit
of
the
eminence
was
densely
thronged
.
<EOS>
Some
sympathy
was
expressed
for
the
unfortunate
lords
about
to
suffer
,
but
it
would
almost
seem
that
the
majority
of
the
spectators
were
drawn
thither
by
curiosity
rather
than
by
any
other
feeling
.
<EOS>
Like
all
other
crowds
they
exhibited
great
impatience
because
they
supposed
they
were
kept
waiting
,
and
manifested
their
displeasure
by
groaning
at
the
Life
-
Guards
,
who
,
however
,
treated
them
with
supreme
contempt
.
<EOS>
Not
till
ten
o'clock
did
the
sheriffs
make
their
appearance
,
and
way
was
cleared
for
them
by
their
guard
through
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
They
proceeded
to
the
Transport
Office
—
a
building
at
the
rear
of
the
scaffold
—
where
rooms
were
prepared
for
those
about
to
die
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
a
bell
within
the
Tower
began
to
toll
,
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
,
a
party
of
grenadiers
issued
from
the
Bulwark
Gate
,
followed
by
two
hackney
-
coaches
in
which
were
the
condemned
nobles
and
their
chaplains
.
<EOS>
With
Lord
Derwentwater
was
Father
Norman
;
with
Lord
Kenmure
was
the
Reverend
Mr.
Sharp
,
a
Presbyterian
minister
.
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
the
coaches
marched
javelin
men
to
keep
off
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Had
not
Lord
Derwentwater
been
attended
by
a
Romish
priest
,
his
youth
and
good
looks
would
have
excited
extraordinary
sympathy
among
the
beholders
,
but
the
sight
of
Father
Norman
irritated
them
,
and
they
expressed
their
hatred
of
Popery
by
hootings
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
seemed
wholly
undisturbed
by
the
clamour
.
<EOS>
Lord
Kenmure
met
with
a
much
better
reception
,
and
Mr.
Sharp
contrived
to
let
the
mob
know
that
his
lordship
held
Popery
in
abomination
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
the
two
lords
were
conducted
to
the
Transport
Office
,
where
they
alighted
,
and
were
separately
conducted
to
their
rooms
.
<EOS>
In
the
room
prepared
for
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
Lord
Widdrington
,
who
had
been
reprieved
,
was
waiting
to
take
a
last
leave
of
his
friend
,
and
was
so
deeply
affected
that
Father
Norman
deemed
it
advisable
that
the
interview
should
not
be
prolonged
.
<EOS>
While
bidding
farewell
to
the
earl
,
Lord
Widdrington
said
,
in
accents
of
profound
emotion:"Were
<EOS>
I
to
live
a
thousand
years
<EOS>
I
should
never
forget
you
!
<EOS>
You
will
always
remain
to
me
an
example
of
fortitude
and
resignation
.
<EOS>
Your
heroism
makes
me
regret
that
I
have
accepted
life
,
since
it
would
be
a
privilege
to
die
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
wish
you
firmness
at
the
last
,
<EOS>
for
I
know
you
will
not
want
it
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
embraced
him
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIIHow
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
was
beheadedLORD
DERWENTWATER
then
addressed
himself
to
his
devotions
,
and
remained
in
earnest
prayer
with
Father
Norman
,
till
the
hour
approached
,
when
the
good
priest
thus
recommended
his
soul
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
thy
soul
shall
depart
from
thy
body
,
may
thy
Redeemer
appear
to
thee
,
and
appoint
thee
a
place
amongst
those
who
are
to
stand
before
him
for
ever!"The
earl
then
arose
,
and
since
the
priest
was
not
allowed
to
be
with
him
to
the
last
,
he
bade
him
an
eternal
adieu
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
the
door
was
opened
,
and
Sir
John
Fryer
,
one
of
the
sheriffs
,
came
in
,
and
,
with
a
grave
salutation
,
inquired
if
he
was
ready
.
<EOS>
"Perfectly
,
"
replied
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
Casting
a
farewell
look
at
the
good
priest
he
then
followed
the
sheriff
,
who
marched
before
him
with
his
men
,
through
two
lines
of
foot
guards
to
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
All
was
prepared
.
<EOS>
The
executioner
was
standing
beside
the
block
with
the
axe
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
him
were
two
assistants
,
and
near
them
was
the
coffin
.
<EOS>
A
slight
murmur
arose
from
the
vast
concourse
as
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
appeared
on
the
scaffold
,
but
it
was
a
murmur
of
admiration
—
all
being
struck
by
his
slight
,
graceful
figure
,
seen
to
the
greatest
advantage
in
his
black
velvet
attire
.
<EOS>
"May
<EOS>
I
say
a
few
words
to
the
assemblage
,
Sir
John
?
"
asked
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Assuredly
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
sheriff
.
<EOS>
The
earl
then
advanced
towards
the
rail
of
the
scaffold
,
and
as
it
was
evident
<EOS>
he
was
about
to
address
them
,
the
concourse
became
instantly
silent
,
and
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
In
a
clear
voice
,
that
was
heard
afar
,
and
vibrated
through
the
breasts
of
all
near
to
him
,
he
thus
spoke:"Being
in
a
few
minutes
about
to
appear
before
the
tribunal
of
Heaven
,
where
,
though
most
unworthy
,
I
hope
to
find
mercy
which
I
have
not
found
from
men
in
power
,
I
have
endeavoured
to
make
my
peace
by
humbly
begging
pardon
for
all
the
sins
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
"I
have
never
had
any
other
sovereign
save
King
James
the
Third
,
whom
I
have
served
from
infancy
;
and
if
his
religion
had
been
different
from
mine
,
I
should
still
have
done
all
I
could
for
him
,
as
my
ancestors
did
for
his
predecessors
.
<EOS>
I
intended
wrong
to
none
,
and
only
to
serve
my
king
and
country
,
and
if
the
sacrifice
of
my
life
could
contribute
to
that
end
,
I
shall
consider
it
well
paid
.
<EOS>
"I
die
a
Roman
Catholic
,
and
in
perfect
charity
with
all
the
world
,
even
with
those
most
instrumental
in
my
destruction
,
and
I
hope
to
be
forgiven
the
trespasses
of
my
youth
by
the
Father
of
Infinite
Mercy
,
into
whose
hands
I
commend
my
spirit
.
<EOS>
"Delivered
as
we
have
described
,
this
brief
address
produced
a
powerful
effect
upon
the
multitude
,
and
however
much
they
might
differ
from
the
earl
,
they
could
not
help
admiring
his
constancy
.
<EOS>
As
he
retired
,
a
loud
wail
arose
from
the
female
portion
of
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
lord
,
"
observed
Sir
John
Fryer
,
"
I
must
beg
you
now
to
prepare
yourself
.
<EOS>
""Grant
<EOS>
me
a
few
moments
more
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
And
the
request
being
accorded
,
he
knelt
down
and
prayed
fervently
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
he
arose
,
and
stepped
towards
the
executioner
,
one
of
whose
men
would
have
helped
him
to
take
off
a
portion
of
his
attire
,
but
he
refused
the
assistance
.
<EOS>
The
executioner
then
besought
his
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
"With
all
my
heart
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
all
my
enemies
—
even
the
most
malicious
of
them
—
and
I
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
"Seeing
<EOS>
the
man
look
hard
at
him
,
he
added:"Thou
wilt
find
a
purse
in
my
pocket
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
thine
with
its
contents
.
<EOS>
""I
thank
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
Will
you
now
try
how
the
block
fits
you?"Thereupon
the
earl
made
the
essay
.
<EOS>
Apparently
satisfied
,
he
turned
to
the
executioner
,
and
said:"Is
thine
axe
sharp?""So
sharp
that
it
will
take
off
a
head
at
a
blow
.
<EOS>
I
pray
your
lordship
to
feel
the
edge
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
I
shall
feel
it
soon
enough
,
"
replied
the
earl
with
a
slight
shudder
.
<EOS>
After
a
momentary
pause
,
he
added:"I
would
die
with
the
holiest
name
on
my
lips
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
thrice
pronounced
it
,
strike!""My
<EOS>
lord
,
I
will
not
fail
,
"
said
the
headsman
.
<EOS>
Laying
himself
upon
the
block
,
the
earl
then
ejaculated:"Lord
Jesu
!
receive
my
spirit
!
<EOS>
Lord
Jesu
!
<EOS>
be
merciful
to
me
!
<EOS>
Lord
Jesu
!
—
"
At
this
juncture
the
axe
descended
.
<EOS>
Next
moment
the
head
was
held
up
to
the
concourse
,
while
the
executioner
called
out
in
trumpet
tones:"Behold
the
head
of
a
traitor
!
<EOS>
God
save
King
George!"An
irrepressible
groan
broke
from
the
concourse
.
<EOS>
The
body
was
instantly
placed
in
the
coffin
,
and
conveyed
to
a
hearse
,
which
was
waiting
for
it
at
a
short
distance
.
<EOS>
But
the
head
was
disposed
of
differently
.
<EOS>
Wrapped
in
black
baize
by
the
direction
of
Sir
John
Fryer
,
it
was
taken
to
a
hackney
-
coach
,
stationed
near
the
hearse
,
and
delivered
to
a
lady
,
habited
in
deep
mourning
,
and
shrouded
in
a
veil
.
<EOS>
With
her
was
a
priest
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
she
receive
the
terrible
bundle
than
she
raised
her
veil
,
and
pressed
her
lips
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
hearse
and
the
coach
then
quitted
Tower
Hill
,
and
were
driven
slowly
to
Dagenham
Park
.
<EOS>
But
the
headsman
had
only
half
finished
his
task
.
<EOS>
When
fresh
sawdust
had
been
strewn
on
the
gory
scaffold
,
another
head
—
that
of
Lord
Kenmure
—
was
fitted
to
the
block
,
and
the
axe
again
fell
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVWhat
happened
in
the
Chapel
at
Dagenham
ParkNOT
till
the
second
night
after
the
earl
's
body
had
been
brought
to
Dagenham
Park
did
the
countess
commence
her
journey
to
Dilston
.
<EOS>
During
the
interval
the
coffin
was
placed
upon
a
catafalque
in
the
chapel
attached
to
the
mansion
,
and
tapers
were
lighted
around
it
—
<EOS>
masses
being
said
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
the
departed
by
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
The
head
had
now
been
replaced
by
the
body
,
but
the
countess
would
not
allow
the
coffin
to
be
closed
,
and
at
night
she
was
left
alone
in
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
After
praying
for
some
time
she
arose
and
gazing
at
her
dead
lord
,
invoked
him
either
to
appear
to
her
,
or
give
her
some
sign
that
he
was
conscious
of
her
presence
.
<EOS>
But
the
pale
features
retained
their
fixed
expression
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
,
she
sat
down
,
and
despite
all
her
efforts
to
resist
it
,
sleep
stole
over
her
.
<EOS>
Then
she
dreamed
that
the
earl
stood
beside
her
,
looking
as
he
had
done
in
life
.
<EOS>
After
contemplating
her
for
a
few
minutes
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
fascinate
her
<EOS>
he
said
in
low
solemn
<EOS>
accents:"Weep
<EOS>
no
more
for
me
,
Anna
!
<EOS>
weep
no
more
!
<EOS>
my
suffering
is
over
.
<EOS>
But
let
my
last
wishes
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
Till
my
body
is
laid
where
I
have
desired
my
spirit
will
wander
near
its
earthly
tabernacle
.
<EOS>
Then
it
will
rest
.
<EOS>
""Give
me
<EOS>
some
token
that
I
have
really
beheld
you
,
my
lord
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"Look
at
my
right
hand
,
and
you
will
be
satisfied
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
phantom
vanished
.
<EOS>
Not
for
some
hours
could
she
rouse
herself
from
the
heavy
slumber
into
which
she
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
She
then
recalled
the
vision
,
but
thought
it
must
have
been
a
dream
.
<EOS>
To
convince
herself
of
the
truth
she
went
to
the
coffin
,
and
raised
the
right
hand
of
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
On
one
of
the
fingers
was
a
ring
which
she
had
not
observed
before
.
<EOS>
Removing
it
,
she
placed
it
on
her
own
finger
.
<EOS>
Reluctant
to
allude
to
the
mysterious
occurrence
,
she
did
not
even
mention
it
to
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
Next
day
she
was
joined
by
Dorothy
Forster
,
who
desired
to
accompany
her
to
Dilston
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VThe
Journey
to
DilstonAT
the
head
of
the
funeral
procession
rode
the
faithful
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
Then
followed
the
hearse
drawn
by
four
horses
,
with
the
coachman
and
two
assistants
,
and
lastly
came
the
countess
in
a
carriage
likewise
drawn
by
four
horses
.
<EOS>
With
her
were
Dorothy
Forster
and
Father
Norman
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
on
which
they
set
forth
,
and
they
tracked
many
weary
miles
through
country
roads
,
making
slow
progress
,
but
meeting
with
no
hindrance
,
till
towards
dawn
,
they
halted
at
a
large
mansion
near
Chelmsford
belonging
to
a
Roman
Catholic
gentleman
,
where
they
halted
and
remained
during
the
day
—
the
coffin
being
removed
from
the
hearse
,
and
placed
in
a
small
private
chapel
,
where
tapers
were
lighted
,
and
masses
said
as
at
Dagenham
.
<EOS>
Here
the
day
was
passed
.
<EOS>
On
the
second
night
,
they
proceeded
to
Cambridge
—
and
on
the
third
to
a
mansion
near
Saint
Ives
,
in
Huntingdonshire
.
<EOS>
Thence
they
moved
on
to
Peterborough
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
they
pursued
the
road
towards
Newcastle
,
journeying
entirely
by
night
,
and
halting
during
the
day
at
some
Roman
Catholic
mansion
,
where
hospitality
was
afforded
them
,
and
where
religious
rites
could
be
performed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
,
long
journey
.
<EOS>
But
the
countess
did
not
find
it
wearisome
.
<EOS>
Rather
she
grieved
to
think
it
must
soon
be
ended
.
<EOS>
She
derived
great
solace
from
the
affectionate
companionship
of
Dorothy
Forster
.
<EOS>
Seven
nights
had
thus
been
passed
in
travel
,
and
they
were
proceeding
on
the
eighth
night
from
Thirsk
towards
Darlington
,
when
a
horseman
rode
up
to
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
At
first
his
appearance
caused
alarm
,
but
fear
quickly
gave
way
to
surprise
when
they
found
it
was
Charles
Radclyffe
.
<EOS>
They
knew
he
had
escaped
from
prison
,
but
supposed
he
was
in
France
.
<EOS>
He
entered
into
no
explanation
then
,
but
contented
himself
with
saying
that
he
should
accompany
them
to
Dilston
,
and
rode
on
with
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
At
Darlington
he
had
a
private
interview
with
Dorothy
,
and
told
her
that
he
could
not
leave
England
without
seeing
her
again
,
and
besought
her
to
accompany
him
in
his
flight
.
<EOS>
"This
is
not
the
moment
to
urge
my
suit
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
option
.
<EOS>
Will
you
fly
with
me
?
<EOS>
Will
you
embrace
the
fortunes
of
a
ruined
man?""I
can
not
decide
now
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
an
answer
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
"From
her
grave
manner
<EOS>
Charles
had
very
little
hope
of
a
favourable
response
.
<EOS>
The
journey
occupied
two
more
nights
,
but
on
the
third
morning
,
they
came
in
sight
of
Dilston
.
<EOS>
Newbiggin
had
ridden
on
to
prepare
the
household
,
and
Charles
Radclyffe
did
not
think
it
safe
to
accompany
the
procession
,
though
fully
intending
to
be
present
at
the
interment
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
VIThe
IntermentTHOUGH
it
was
known
that
the
earl
's
estates
were
forfeited
,
the
confiscation
had
not
yet
taken
place
,
and
,
consequently
,
the
household
still
remained
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
execution
they
had
been
filled
with
superstitious
dread
.
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
that
terrible
day
,
most
remarkable
Northern
Lights
were
seen
,
and
the
reflection
of
the
crimson
sky
seemed
to
turn
the
water
of
the
brook
in
the
haunted
glen
to
blood
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
a
violent
tempest
occurred
,
accompanied
by
thunder
and
lightning
.
<EOS>
Several
trees
were
blown
down
,
and
the
finest
oak
in
the
park
was
struck
—
the
trunk
being
completely
shattered
.
<EOS>
All
the
household
was
now
assembled
to
watch
the
funeral
procession
as
it
made
its
way
slowly
up
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
Groans
and
lamentations
were
heard
when
the
hearse
arrived
at
the
gate
,
and
the
coffin
was
taken
out
,
and
conveyed
to
the
little
chapel
.
<EOS>
Not
till
this
had
been
done
did
the
countess
and
Dorothy
enter
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Completely
prostrated
,
they
strove
to
prepare
themselves
for
the
closing
ceremonial
that
was
to
take
place
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
A
doleful
place
was
Dilston
during
that
day
.
<EOS>
Its
inmates
were
bowed
down
with
grief
,
and
moved
about
like
ghosts
.
<EOS>
All
needful
preparations
for
the
interment
were
made
by
Newbiggin
.
<EOS>
The
vault
was
opened
.
<EOS>
The
coffin
was
laid
upon
a
bier
not
far
from
the
altar
,
and
tapers
were
lighted
around
it
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
old
servants
and
dependents
,
among
whom
were
Nicholas
Ribbleton
and
Nathan
Blacklaw
,
went
to
the
chapel
to
pray
beside
the
body
of
their
lord
.
<EOS>
Not
till
night
did
Charles
Radclyffe
appear
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
He
sought
out
Dorothy
and
said
to
her:"I
shall
quit
Dilston
immediately
after
the
interment
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
with
me?""I
can
not
leave
Lady
Derwentwater
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
.
<EOS>
At
midnight
the
little
chapel
was
filled
with
the
late
earl
's
retainers
.
<EOS>
The
countess
and
Dorothy
knelt
in
front
of
the
altar
,
and
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Newbiggin
were
stationed
near
the
coffin
.
<EOS>
The
solemn
service
was
performed
by
Father
Norman
,
and
amid
the
tears
of
all
present
the
last
Lord
of
Derwentwater
was
laid
with
his
ancestors
.
