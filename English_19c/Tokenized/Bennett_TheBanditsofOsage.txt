THE
TRAVELERS.A
few
years
since
,
most
of
the
western
States
and
Territories
—
particularly
those
bordering
upon
the
great
Mississippi
—
were
infested
with
bands
of
lawless
desperadoes
,
collected
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
,
who
,
having
become
criminals
in
their
native
land
,
here
sought
an
asylum
,
either
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
entirely
,
or
where
stern
Justice
being
weak
,
was
relaxed
from
that
severity
which
she
exercised
in
the
more
populous
sections
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Here
,
in
many
cases
,
they
formed
themselves
into
bands
,
choosing
some
one
of
the
more
bold
and
daring
of
their
party
for
leader
—
their
purpose
,
doubtless
,
being
the
greater
facility
of
proceeding
in
their
depredations
,
as
well
as
firmer
security
against
apprehension
.
<EOS>
But
,
although
,
as
we
have
remarked
,
they
formed
themselves
into
bands
or
parties
,
yet
rarely
,
in
fact
we
believe
only
in
extreme
cases
,
did
they
openly
act
in
concert
;
their
policy
being
to
conceal
from
their
more
honest
neighbors
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
regular
organized
combination
of
men
for
outlawry
purposes
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
It
was
their
policy
,
also
,
to
disperse
themselves
throughout
the
country
;
to
meet
only
at
certain
intervals
,
and
then
in
secret
,
under
cover
of
night
;
by
which
means
they
would
appear
as
honest
citizens
;
live
,
many
of
them
,
unsuspected
,
and
in
all
cases
be
among
the
first
to
learn
of
whatever
movement
might
chance
to
be
in
progress
detrimental
to
their
interests
as
a
body
,
or
to
any
member
individually
,
and
thus
be
enabled
to
take
measures
to
prevent
,
or
lay
secret
plans
to
counteract
it
.
<EOS>
This
will
,
we
think
,
sufficiently
account
for
their
,
in
many
cases
,
long
and
sometimes
undisturbed
career
of
dissipation
and
crime
.
<EOS>
Our
story
opens
a
few
years
subsequent
to
the
close
of
the
last
war
with
England
,
and
at
a
period
when
the
interior
of
Missouri
—
the
theatre
of
the
scenes
,
incidents
and
characters
which
are
about
to
follow
—
was
,
comparatively
,
but
little
known
;
in
fact
,
we
believe
we
may
with
propriety
say
,
there
were
portions
within
its
territorial
boundaries
at
this
time
unseen
and
untrod
by
the
eye
and
foot
of
the
white
man
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
there
were
sections
of
it
uninhabited
,
there
was
already
a
tide
of
emigration
setting
in
from
the
eastward
,
which
rendered
it
probable
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
,
at
the
farthest
,
it
would
not
only
be
fully
explored
,
but
settled
,
by
some
of
the
more
enterprising
and
industrious
inhabitants
of
the
States
lying
east
of
the
great
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
Even
now
the
eastern
portion
of
it
was
beginning
to
exhibit
signs
of
settlement
and
civilization
,
and
already
the
blue
smoke
arose
from
many
a
cot
which
here
<EOS>
and
there
dotted
the
long
line
of
forest
bordering
on
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
This
forest
followed
the
windings
of
the
river
and
extended
back
some
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
,
opening
,
in
some
places
,
upon
the
large
and
beautiful
prairie
,
where
the
tall
grass
waved
to
and
fro
in
the
breeze
,
containing
its
legions
of
wild
animals
,
and
where
the
eye
could
range
uninterruptedly
for
miles
on
miles
,
as
over
some
vast
sea
,
until
finally
shut
in
by
the
far
distant
horizon
.
<EOS>
In
some
parts
of
this
forest
the
ground
for
miles
was
nearly
level
,
and
only
required
the
removal
of
the
underbrush
to
make
it
a
beautiful
grove
,
while
other
parts
were
wild
,
rocky
and
mountainous
,
presenting
to
the
eye
of
the
beholder
many
grand
and
romantic
scenes
,
as
though
Nature
had
designed
to
soothe
,
awe
and
display
her
power
by
strong
and
varying
contrasts
.
<EOS>
As
before
remarked
,
that
region
of
country
known
as
Missouri
,
was
fast
emerging
from
savage
to
civilized
life
—
from
a
gloomy
wilderness
to
the
abodes
of
civilization
.
<EOS>
The
axe
might
now
be
heard
in
the
forests
where
,
but
a
few
years
before
,
echoed
the
wild
war
-
whoop
of
the
Indian
.
<EOS>
On
the
banks
of
that
rapid
and
mighty
stream
,
from
which
Missouri
takes
her
name
,
a
few
regular
settlements
had
sprung
up
—
among
the
most
prominent
of
which
we
will
mention
the
old
town
of
Franklin
,
a
place
that
has
long
since
disappeared
,
having
been
literally
swept
away
by
the
eternal
knawings
of
this
river
whose
bed
is
continually
changing
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
Missouri
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
as
must
naturally
be
the
case
in
every
new
settlement
,
were
composed
of
all
classes
,
from
the
refined
,
educated
and
intellectual
,
to
the
coarse
,
ignorant
,
demi
-
savage
race
,
which
are
ever
found
to
exist
as
a
kind
of
medium
between
refinement
and
utter
barbarity
.
<EOS>
Having
made
these
few
preliminary
remarks
,
so
that
the
reader
may
form
an
idea
of
the
then
existing
state
of
the
country
,
we
will
now
at
once
proceed
with
our
story
.
<EOS>
It
was
near
the
close
of
a
hot
sultry
day
,
in
the
summer
of
18
—
,
that
two
travelers
were
slowly
wending
their
way
over
a
wild
and
somewhat
mountainous
tract
of
land
,
some
thirty
miles
distant
and
in
a
south
-
westerly
direction
from
St.
Louis
.
<EOS>
The
elder
of
the
two
was
a
man
<EOS>
about
thirty
-
five
years
of
age
,
whose
height
rather
exceeded
six
feet
,
<EOS>
and
although
not
what
might
be
termed
of
handsome
proportions
,
yet
of
that
close
knit
and
sinewy
build
which
gives
evidence
of
great
muscular
strength
and
a
capability
of
enduring
much
hardship
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
,
which
was
visible
from
his
hat
being
partly
removed
,
was
of
medium
proportions
,
on
one
side
of
which
was
carelessly
parted
his
long
raven
colored
hair
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
long
,
thin
and
rather
strongly
marked
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
was
large
,
around
which
played
a
peculiar
smile
which
,
to
convey
an
idea
of
,
we
shall
term
a
philosophical
one
.
<EOS>
His
lips
were
thick
—
cheeks
somewhat
hollow
—
nose
long
and
pointed
—
eyes
small
and
grey
,
with
a
peculiar
twinkle
in
the
latter
,
when
speaking
,
which
led
one
to
fancy
there
was
more
meant
than
said
—
and
altogether
the
whole
expression
of
his
features
was
a
combination
of
cunning
,
shrewdness
and
candor
,
mingled
with
a
quiet
,
thoughtful
and
humorous
turn
of
mind
.
<EOS>
In
speech
he
was
very
deliberate
,
and
no
matter
by
what
circumstances
surrounded
,
would
never
fail
to
give
each
word
its
proper
bearing
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
a
plain
home
-
spun
suit
of
sheep
's
grey
—
an
article
much
worn
by
the
yeomen
of
that
day
—
and
his
dialect
partook
strongly
of
that
peculiarity
which
distinguishes
the
people
of
New
England
—
particularly
those
who
have
little
access
to
society
—
from
almost
every
other
;
and
was
,
besides
,
of
that
uncouth
form
of
speech
,
which
is
engendered
from
habit
,
when
not
polished
by
the
refinement
of
education
.
<EOS>
His
companion
was
a
very
different
personage
;
in
fact
,
of
an
entirely
opposite
cast
.
<EOS>
In
years
he
was
some
five
the
other
's
junior
—
some
three
inches
less
in
stature
—
of
a
form
full
of
grace
and
elasticity
—
a
face
almost
round
—
a
complexion
ruddy
—
large
,
restless
grey
eyes
—
with
much
hauteur
in
his
bearing
,
and
of
an
active
and
rather
irritable
temperament
.
<EOS>
His
articulation
corresponded
with
his
temperament
,
being
quick
and
impetuous
,
and
his
language
gave
evidence
of
his
superiority
over
the
other
in
point
of
education
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
a
plain
suit
of
black
,
a
little
the
worse
for
wear
perhaps
,
but
of
an
excellent
fit
,
which
,
together
with
the
fine
texture
of
the
cloth
,
the
graceful
ease
with
which
it
was
worn
,
had
been
proof
sufficient
the
wearer
was
no
laborer
,
even
were
not
the
soft
white
hand
,
holding
a
light
fancy
cane
,
to
be
taken
as
evidence
.
<EOS>
To
some
,
perhaps
,
it
may
appear
singular
that
two
individuals
,
so
directly
opposite
in
personal
appearance
,
manners
,
dress
and
temperament
,
should
be
companions
,
and
what
is
more
,
friends
;
yet
such
was
the
case
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
old
adage
that
"
like
clings
to
like
,
"
it
must
be
admitted
we
have
a
great
many
exceptions
,
and
that
like
clings
to
unlike
may
be
said
with
propriety
of
the
social
relations
and
connections
of
mankind
in
general
.
<EOS>
It
is
by
this
process
the
great
strings
of
Nature
are
made
to
blend
their
sounds
in
harmony
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
near
the
close
of
the
day
,
and
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
had
been
intercepted
by
a
thick
,
black
thunder
cloud
,
which
,
approaching
rapidly
,
threatened
our
travelers
with
a
heavy
shower
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
neither
spoke
,
but
silently
glancing
toward
the
west
,
both
immediately
advanced
from
a
slow
to
a
rapid
pace
.
<EOS>
The
younger
was
the
first
to
break
silence
with
the
exclamation
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
as
a
flash
of
lightning
,
more
vivid
than
any
previous
,
flung
its
red
lurid
glare
over
them
,
and
for
a
moment
seemed
to
put
the
forest
in
a
blaze
,
followed
almost
instantaneously
by
a
heavy
crash
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
heavens
!
<EOS>
Bernard
,
there
is
no
mistaking
that
!
<EOS>
How
far
are
we
now
from
Webber's?""Wal
,
I
should
guess
about
five
miles
,
"
replied
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"Five
miles
!
"
echoed
the
other
quickly
,
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Harvey
,
what
are
you
thinking
about
?
<EOS>
It
was
only
ten
miles
when
we
last
enquired
,
nearly
two
hours
since
,
and
now
you
think
we
have
only
reached
half
way
!
<EOS>
—
Pshaw!""Wal
,
"
remarked
Bernard
,
coolly
and
quietly
,
"
this
ere
's
a
free
country
,
and
every
body
's
got
a
right
to
their
own
opinion
<EOS>
any
how
;
and
so
,
as
the
feller
said
,
if
you
do
n't
like
the
distance
at
five
miles
,
you
can
have
it
for
any
distance
<EOS>
you
're
a
mind
to
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
a
moment
a
half
angry
smile
played
around
the
mouth
of
the
younger
,
as
though
he
would
have
laughed
,
but
was
checked
by
some
opposite
feeling
,
while
he
bit
his
nether
lip
and
tapped
his
cane
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
a
quick
,
nervous
motion
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
"
rejoined
he
,
quickly
,
"
if
we
have
yet
five
miles
to
travel
,
our
pace
must
be
still
increased
,
for
the
night
gathers
<EOS>
fast!""I
calculate
we
'd
about
as
well
be
seeking
for
a
shelter
,
"
remarked
Bernard
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"A
shelter
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
other
in
surprise
;
"
surely
you
do
not
dream
of
spending
the
night
in
this
lonely
place?""Wal
,
as
to
the
matter
o
'
that
,
"
answered
Bernard
,
"
I
reckon
I
do
n't
dream
<EOS>
no
how
,
'cause
I
'm
awake
and
its
a
sartin
thing
;
and
when
a
body
's
awake
and
sartin
,
ye
see
he
ai
n't
a
dreaming
;
but"—and
he
looked
coolly
at
the
other
,
speaking
slowly
<EOS>
and
impressively—"if
you
want
to
tell
your
friends
of
your
adventures
,
and
put
this
'
ere
night
in
as
one
of
'em
<EOS>
,
you
haint
got
a
minute
to
lose
'
tween
this
and
the
time
your
head
's
under
something
more
powerful
to
protect
it
than
that
are
beaver
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
what
mean
you
?
"
cried
the
other
,
turning
somewhat
pale
.
<EOS>
"D'ye
see
that
are
cloud
?
"
said
Bernard
,
elevating
his
finger
to
an
angle
of
some
forty
-
five
degrees
;
"
now
mark
all
the
twists
in't
,
and
keep
tally
for
about
a
minute
all
them
are
streaks
o
'
lightning
dancing
up
and
down
,
and
I
reckon
you
'll
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
safest
place
for
Marcus
Tyrone
do
n't
lay
in
the
open
air
by
any
means
.
<EOS>
""Ay
!
<EOS>
true
,
true
!
"
returned
Tyrone
,
with
a
start
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Bernard
,
right
;
for
there
is
something
awful
in
yonder
cloud
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
We
can
reach
no
habitation
,
and
to
remain
here
is
,
<EOS>
I
fear
,
but
to
expose
ourselves
to
certain
death
!
<EOS>
Can
we
not
find
shelter
under
some
of
these
rocks?""Why
,
ye
see
,
Mark
,
I
'll
jest
tell
ye
<EOS>
how
'
tis
,
"
answered
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
do
n't
find
some
place
to
git
our
heads
under
soon
,
its
my
opinion
<EOS>
they
wo
nt
be
no
further
use
to
us
;
for
that
are
storm
ai
nt
a
going
to
be
no
common
one
,
or
else
I
ai
nt
no
judge
.
<EOS>
Now
right
away
here
to
the
left
o
'
<EOS>
us
is
a
cave
;
for
a
feller
pointed
it
out
to
me
when
I
traveled
this
way
afore
,
and
said
folks
kind
o
'
reckened
as
how
it
were
a
ren
—
ren
—
something
,
for
robbers
.
<EOS>
""Rendezvous
,
doubtless
,
"
remarked
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"O
<EOS>
yes
,
that
's
it
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
what
makes
folks
use
such
tarnal
hard
names
now
-
a
-
days
;
they
did
n't
use
to
when
I
got
edicated
.
'
<EOS>
Spect
they
're
gitting
a
great
deal
smarter
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mark?""Doubtless
,
"
replied
the
other
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
of
the
cave
,
Harvey?""O
yes
;
wal
,
I
calculate
we
'd
about
as
well
be
putting
our
heads
inside
on't
,
for
we
wo
nt
<EOS>
no
more'n
git
killed
if
its
got
robbers
in
it
,
and
if
we
stay
out
here

I
swow
we
'll
git
blown
clean
into
a
jiffy
,
for
that
<EOS>

yonder
ai

<EOS>
a
going
to
be
over
nice
about
what
it
does

,
that
's
a
fact

<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
where
is
this
cave
,
Harvey?""D'ye
see
that
are
rough
pile

stones

right
away

ca
n't
git
there
too
soon
,
for
<EOS>
that
are
<EOS>
last
streak
o
'
lightning
fairly
felt
hot
.
<EOS>
Come
on
,
Mark
,
do
n't
go
to
getting
skeered
now
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
<EOS>
!
"
returned
Tyrone
,
his
features
becoming
a
shade
more
pale
;
and
following
Bernard
,
he
proceeded
directly
towards
the
spot
designated
;
though
,
perhaps
,
with
feelings
less
at
ease
than
he
would
have
his
companion
imagine
.
<EOS>
The
cave
alluded
to
,
was
situated
near
the
brow
of
a
steep
,
rocky
hill
or
bluff
,
some
several
rods
distant
to
the
left
of
the
road
,
which
our
travelers
had
just
quitted
,
and
appeared
to
have
been
formed
by
some
great
convulsion
of
nature
,
in
the
rending
and
upheaving
of
rocks
,
which
had
fallen
together
so
as
to
leave
a
cavity
sufficiently
large
to
contain
several
persons
.
<EOS>
The
mouth
of
this
cave
fronted
the
south
,
and
overlooked
the
beautiful
Maramee
,
which
rolled
sparkling
along
some
fifty
yards
below
,
and
was
surrounded
by
scenery
romantic
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
The
hill
on
which
it
stood
was
a
portion
of
a
ridge
which
extended
in
an
irregular
line
far
away
to
the
southwest
and
northeast
.
<EOS>
Immediately
above
and
below
this
cave
were
large
projecting
rocks
,
which
,
to
all
appearance
,
were
so
slightly
bedded
in
the
earth
,
that
<EOS>
but
little
force
was
necessary
to
send
them
thundering
to
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
A
dwarfish
growth
of
shrub
-
oaks
had
struggled
up
between
them
,
and
presented
their
rough
,
shaggy
tops
above
,
as
though
to
give
the
scene
an
air
of
wildness
and
desolation
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
this
,
there
was
a
fine
redeeming
trait
in
the
surrounding
scenery
—
viewed
from
the
brow
of
the
hill
—
whose
beauty
was
heightened
by
contrasts
the
most
pleasing
.
<EOS>
At
its
base
on
the
western
side
,
was
a
finely
timbered
forest
,
stretching
far
away
northward
,
and
finally
opening
upon
a
beautiful
strip
of
meadow
or
prairie
land
,
over
which
the
eye
might
wander
for
miles
,
to
rest
at
last
upon
a
blue
hazy
ridge
of
mountains
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
The
view
towards
the
east
and
south
was
not
so
extensive
,
but
this
likewise
had
its
attractions
.
<EOS>
A
distant
perspective
was
cut
off
by
another
ridge
,
running
almost
parallel
to
the
one
just
described
;
but
the
loss
was
amply
compensated
,
by
the
wild
picturesque
scenery
presented
,
and
the
gentle
murmur
which
stole
sweetly
upon
the
ear
,
as
the
Maramee
sent
its
waters
foaming
and
dashing
over
its
rocky
bed
between
,
anon
to
glance
off
into
a
still
silvery
belt
and
for
a
time
mirror
surrounding
objects
ere
forever
lost
in
the
bosom
of
the
mighty
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
The
road
of
which
mention
has
already
been
made
—
though
it
would
,
perhaps
,
poorly
compare
with
some
of
the
present
day
—
was
,
for
this
period
and
section
of
country
,
uncommonly
good
—
being
mostly
clear
of
stones
,
stumps
,
brush
and
the
like
—
so
that
a
skilful
horseman
might
dash
rapidly
over
it
with
little
danger
of
life
or
limb
.
<EOS>
To
the
eastward
it
followed
the
windings
of
the
Maramee
,
for
some
considerable
distance
,
through
a
thick
,
dark
ravine
,
and
then
branched
off
through
a
level
and
extensive
forest
.
<EOS>
As
light
one
horse
vehicles
were
not
in
use
at
this
period
,
and
more
especially
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
the
horse
was
ridden
instead
by
those
who
prefered
an
easier
and
more
speedy
locomotion
than
walking
,
and
in
consequence
every
settler
of
note
was
supplied
with
a
number
of
these
noble
animals
,
for
the
use
of
himself
and
family
.
<EOS>
But
we
fear
the
reader
will
think
us
digressing
,
and
so
let
us
return
to
our
travelers
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
II.THE
STORM
—
<EOS>
THE
KIDNAPPERS.Although
Bernard
approached
the
cave
with
a
firm
step
,
apparently
indifferent
as
to
what
might
be
therein
concealed
,
yet
it
must
be
admitted
there
were
feelings
within
his
breast
strangely
at
variance
with
his
calm
,
unmoved
exterior
.
<EOS>
Twice
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
coming
to
a
halt
,
but
then
,
as
though
actuated
by
some
counteracting
feeling
,
he
strode
steadily
onward
,
and
was
soon
standing
at
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
fast
growing
dark
,
for
the
coming
storm
had
considerably
advanced
the
night
,
and
although
the
sun
had
barely
set
,
objects
at
<EOS>
but
a
little
distance
appeared
dim
and
indistinct
,
save
when
thrown
into
bold
relief
,
for
a
moment
,
by
some
vivid
flash
of
lightning
,
when
,
as
if
to
repair
the
error
,
they
apparently
sunk
into
a
deeper
gloom
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Casting
a
hasty
glance
behind
him
,
and
perceiving
his
companion
close
at
hand
,
Bernard
motioned
him
to
silence
,
and
had
cautiously
began
his
entrance
,
when
a
hurried
exclamation
from
the
other
caused
him
to
look
around
,
and
seeing
him
gazing
steadily
towards
the
west
,
he
turned
his
eyes
in
that
direction
,
and
soon
became
transfixed
as
though
by
a
spell
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
remarked
it
was
growing
dark
,
but
below
the
gloom
had
deepened
into
night
,
which
lay
like
a
pall
along
the
valley
,
into
which
even
the
lightning
,
as
it
played
along
the
tops
of
the
trees
with
a
lurid
glare
,
seemed
unable
to
penetrate
.
<EOS>
But
the
scene
higher
up
was
what
had
caught
and
riveted
the
attention
of
our
travelers
.
<EOS>
Just
over
the
summit
of
another
hill
,
towards
the
west
,
was
a
white
misty
streak
,
which
lay
spread
along
the
horizon
,
like
in
appearance
a
bank
of
snow
seen
through
a
fog
,
above
which
awful
black
clouds
were
rolling
,
and
tumbling
,
and
twisting
themselves
into
the
most
angry
shapes
possible
—
belching
forth
their
forked
tongues
of
lightning
—
seeming
like
some
dark
and
mighty
spirits
of
the
etherial
,
enraged
,
and
charging
with
all
Heaven
's
artillery
against
this
nether
world
.
<EOS>
During
the
intervals
between
each
clap
of
thunder
,
a
roaring
sound
,
like
that
of
some
distant
waterfall
,
was
borne
to
the
ears
of
the
travelers
with
a
startling
distinctness
,
gradually
increasing
each
moment
,
until
it
sounded
like
the
roll
of
an
hundred
drums
.
<EOS>
During
this
brief
space
—
for
brief
indeed
it
was
—
not
a
twig
was
seen
to
move
—
not
a
leaf
to
stir
—
but
all
,
all
was
motionless
,
us
though
Nature
were
holding
her
breath
in
awe
of
some
great
and
mighty
convulsion
.
<EOS>
The
air
felt
hot
,
thick
and
oppressive
,
as
from
the
breath
of
an
evil
spirit
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
trees
on
the
other
hill
became
dreadfully
agitated
—
bowing
their
heads
,
and
writhing
,
and
twisting
themselves
into
all
manner
of
shapes
possible
,
while
a
dark
misty
shadow
crept
,
or
rather
swept
along
,
and
buried
them
in
terrible
night
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
appeared
to
our
travelers
,
who
,
warned
by
this
and
a
few
heavy
drops
of
rain
,
now
eagerly
sought
their
shelter
;
Bernard
,
as
previously
,
taking
the
precedence
.
<EOS>
Moving
cautiously
forward
,
after
entering
the
mouth
of
the
cave
—
for
caution
was
a
part
of
his
nature
—
he
presently
gained
the
interior
,
where
he
was
immediately
joined
by
his
companion
.
<EOS>
A
flash
of
lightning
at
this
moment
discovered
to
our
travellers
that
they
were
the
only
occupants
of
the
cave
,
when
something
like
a
sigh
from
Bernard
,
and
the
ejaculation
of
"
Thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
from
Tyrone
,
attested
the
relief
felt
by
both
.
<EOS>
"I
say
,
Mark
,
"
began
Bernard
,
who
was
the
first
to
speak
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
this
ere
cave
's
a
ren
—
what
d'ye
call
it?""Rendezvous
,
"
answered
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"O
<EOS>
yes
,
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
do
n't
believe
this
ere
cave
's
a
rendezvous
for
robbers
,
for
when
that
are
last
streak
<EOS>
o
'
lightning
danced
around
in
here
<EOS>
,
I
could'nt
see
no
traces
of
its
being
inhabited
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
led
you
to
think
inhabited
,
Harvey?""Why
,
when
I
's
out
here
afore
,
I
hearn
a
good
deal
o
'
talk
about
a
banditti
,
which
had
been
skeering
people
round
here
,
and
some
feller
told
me
they
used
to
meet
in
this
ere
cave
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
?
<EOS>
But
why
did
not
the
citizens
take
measures
to
apprehend
them
?
<EOS>
"
enquired
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Wal
<EOS>
,
there
was
some
such
kind
o
'
talk
,
but
I
do
n't
know
how
it
come
out
,
for
jest
about
that
time
<EOS>
I
went
back
to
the
East
,
and
haint
never
heard
nothing
on't
since
.
<EOS>
But
I
say
,
Mark
,
its
lucky
<EOS>
we
've
got
in
here
<EOS>
,
I
swow
—
robbers
or
not
—
for
that
are
harrycane
's
ripping
every
thing
afore
it
.
<EOS>
Jest
listen
how
it
roars
.
<EOS>
I
never
—
"
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
,
if
spoken
,
was
drowned
in
a
terrible
crash
of
thunder
,
that
shook
the
ground
beneath
them
,
and
caused
both
the
speaker
and
his
companion
to
start
involuntarily
.
<EOS>
During
the
conversation
just
recorded
,
the
storm
had
been
rushing
on
with
all
the
wild
fury
of
a
tornado
,
and
now
came
sweeping
down
the
opposite
hill
—
tearing
along
through
the
valley
—
up
the
hill
—
dashing
against
the
cave
,
as
though
to
rend
it
asunder
—
snapping
lofty
trees
like
twigs
—
tearing
them
,
in
many
instances
,
quite
up
by
the
roots
--
hissing
,
and
foaming
,
and
roaring
—
<EOS>
on
,
on
it
went
in
its
mad
career
,
seeking
new
victims
amid
the
quiet
glades
,
and
making
the
very
earth
beneath
it
tremble
in
its
fierce
carousal
!
<EOS>
For
some
half
hour
our
travelers
stood
mute
—
awed
to
silence
by
the
raging
of
the
elements
—
gazing
forth
through
the
aperture
,
assisted
by
the
incessant
flashes
of
lightning
,
upon
the
awful
devastation
going
on
without
.
<EOS>
"A
fortunate
escape
,
truly
!
"
remarked
Tyrone
,
at
length
,
drawing
a
long
breath
.
<EOS>
"Jest
<EOS>
what
I
's
a
thinking
on
exactly
,
"
returned
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"
I
knowed
when
I
seed
it
a
coming
up
,
that
there
would
n't
be
no
child
's
play
about
it
;
but
its
gone
clean
ahead
<EOS>
o
'
my
calculations
altogether
.
<EOS>
How
them
are
streaks
o
'
lightning
did
dance
around
us
here
,
and
cut
capers
'
mong
the
trees
.
<EOS>
I
never
seed
the
like
on't
afore
in
all
my
born
days
.
<EOS>
For
the
matter
o
'
that
,
they
haint
done
yet
,
"
added
he
,
as
a
bright
flash
for
a
moment
<EOS>
blinded
him
,
and
a
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
cave
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
his
companion
made
no
reply
,
and
then
in
a
complaining
,
petulent
tone
said
:
"
Was
there
ever
any
thing
so
unlucky
?
<EOS>
Only
to
think
of
our
being
literally
forced
to
pass
the
night
in
such
a
place
as
this
,
and
so
near
our
destination
too
!
<EOS>
I
declare
it
vexes
me
.
<EOS>
""Hello
!
<EOS>
What
's
all
this
ere
gammon
about
now
?
"
cried
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
strangest
,
queerest
chap
<EOS>
I
ever
seed
in
all
my
life
;
one
minute
all
thankfulness
and
the
next
all
grumbles
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
ye
larn
a
little
patience
?
<EOS>
A
body'd
think
when
you
'd
jest
'
scaped
with
your
life
,
you
<EOS>
would'nt
,
in
all
human
probability
,
set
up
grumbling
for
half
an
hour
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
""Well
<EOS>
,
well
,
Bernard
,
say
no
more
,
"
replied
Tyrone
,
in
a
voice
of
contrition
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
hasty
,
impatient
nature
,
and
must
overlook
my
language
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
was
wrong
in
me
to
complain
;
but
I
had
set
my
heart
so
much
on
reaching
Webber
's
to
-
night
,
that
it
seemed
hard
to
relinquish
the
design
.
<EOS>
""Now
<EOS>
you
speak
a
little
more
sensible
like
,
"
rejoined
Bernard
;
"
and
as
to
gitting
to
Webber
's
,
I
guess
we
'll
be
able
to
do
it
<EOS>
yit
.
<EOS>
The
moon
'll
be
up
in
about
an
hour
,
and
I
reckon
this
ere
storm
will
clear
away
by
that
time
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
Bernard
was
right
.
<EOS>
In
an
hour
the
storm
had
passed
on
to
the
east
,
leaving
behind
it
a
few
broken
,
scattered
clouds
,
sailing
lazily
through
the
air
—
above
which
Heaven
's
diamonds
gleamed
and
sparkled
—
now
hidden
from
the
sight
,
now
shining
out
merrily
—
while
the
far
off
flashes
and
distant
rumble
betokened
the
storm
still
speeding
on
in
its
fury
.
<EOS>
Anon
the
moon
arose
,
slowly
and
majestically
,
to
pour
her
silvery
flood
of
light
upon
the
scene
,
While
here
and
there
a
modest
starDrew
back
from
Luna
's
ray
,
Yet
shining
in
its
realm
afar
,
Perchance
the
queen
of
day
.
<EOS>
Our
travelers
,
now
that
the
storm
was
passed
and
moon
risen
,
deeming
it
expedient
to
resume
their
journey
,
emerged
at
once
from
the
cave
,
and
had
advanced
a
few
paces
towards
the
road
,
when
their
attention
and
progress
were
arrested
by
the
sound
of
voices
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
At
first
the
sounds
were
indistinct
,
but
gradually
they
seemed
to
grow
louder
,
denoting
thereby
the
approach
of
the
speakers
.
<EOS>
At
length
they
descried
two
figures
descending
the
hill
,
and
instantly
crouching
behind
a
rock
,
were
enabled
to
overhear
a
few
sentences
as
they
passed
.
<EOS>
"I
do
n't
believe
a
word
on't
,
"
growled
a
gruff
voice
,
accompanied
with
an
oath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Its
only
one
of
the
old
fool
's
freaks
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
've
served
him
long
enough
,
and
blast
me
if
I
do
n't
slit
his
wesand
,
as
soon
as
I
find
out
whar
he
stows
the
shiners
,
and
then
make
off
and
set
up
for
a
gentleman
in
some
foreign
part
;
hey
,
Bill
?
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
,
ha!""Hist
!
"
returned
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
Thar
's
no
perticular
use
in
telling
every
body
else
what
you
're
going
to
do
,
as
I
knows
on
;
and
besides
,
if
the
gal
and
her
lover
should
happen
to
hear
ye
,
why
ye
see
its
all
up
at
once
.
<EOS>
Curses
on
that
ar
'
storm
,
"
he
added
;
"
I
'm
feard
as
how
they
'll
bunk
somewhere
and
take
daylight
for't
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
like
'em
to
slip
me
now
,
for
such
a
chance
<EOS>
do
n't
come
every
day
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
can
the
old
fool
want
of
the
gal
?
<EOS>
"
growled
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
I
've
told
ye
once
,
you
—
but
hark
!
<EOS>
they
're
coming
,
and
so
—
"
here
the
conversation
became
so
indistinct
that
our
travelers
could
make
out
nothing
further
,
save
the
word
"
pistols
,
"
which
occured
shortly
after
;
but
enough
had
been
gleaned
to
denote
foul
play
,
and
simultaneously
grasping
their
weapons
,
both
advanced
cautiously
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
The
moon
as
yet
had
not
risen
sufficiently
to
be
of
any
material
service
in
distinguishing
objects
even
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
and
the
ravine
below
still
lay
in
the
gloomy
repose
of
solitude
and
darkness
.
<EOS>
Gliding
quickly
forward
,
but
at
the
same
time
as
stealthily
as
possible
,
our
travelers
soon
gained
sufficient
on
the
ruffians
to
enable
them
to
see
their
dusky
forms
,
and
overhear
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
foremost
two
came
to
a
halt
,
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
just
where
you
enter
the
ravine
already
mentioned
,
and
separating
<EOS>
,
each
took
his
station
opposite
the
other
—
one
on
either
side
of
the
road
—
which
being
at
this
point
uncommonly
narrow
,
owing
to
some
rocks
having
been
removed
and
piled
up
on
either
hand
,
made
it
a
desirable
place
for
their
attack
upon
the
individuals
approaching
,
who
must
necessarily
pass
within
their
reach
.
<EOS>
Ensconsing
themselves
behind
some
bushes
,
which
grew
by
the
way
side
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
awaited
in
anxious
suspense
the
moment
when
they
would
,
probably
—
in
defence
of
others
—
be
called
into
action
of
no
enviable
nature
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
all
was
still
,
and
then
the
silence
was
broken
by
one
of
the
ruffians
.
<EOS>
"I
say
,
Bill
Riley
!
"
<EOS>
began
he
of
the
gruff
voice
,
"
blast
me
,
but
your
ears
is
a
little
over
-
keen
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Per'aps
<EOS>
you
hears
'em
coming
now
,
but
hang
me
if
I
do
,
and
what
's
more
,
haint
heard
'
em
.
<EOS>
""Per'aps
<EOS>
I
's
mistaken
,
"
answered
the
other
;
"
at
least
I
thought
I
heard
'em
.
<EOS>
However
,
thar
's
no
perticular
harm
in
being
ready
'
gin
they
do
come
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
""You're
<EOS>
right
thar
'
,
my
trump
.
<EOS>
But
what
d'ye
think
,
croney
;
is't
best
to
leave
the
younker
in
Heaven?""No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
Curdish
,
"
replied
the
other
vehenently
;
"
no
murder
,
if
we
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
Tap
the
feller
over
,
but
no
killing
;
that
's
a
perticularly
agly
business
,
brings
ugly
consequences
,
and
a
feller
's
mighty
apt
to
catch
hemp
fever
arter
it
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
Jack
,
my
boy
,
we
musn't
have
no
killing
.
<EOS>
Jest
knock
the
younker
over
gently
—
mount
his
horse
—
I'll
mount
behind
the
gal
,
and
then
we
'll
sort
o
'
travel
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
hang
me
for
a
green
un
,
but
I
think
—
rayther
think
,
Bill
—
we'll
travel
then
,
ha
,
ha
,

.
<EOS>
But
'
sposin
,
my
ace
o
'
trumps
,
the
younker
happens
to
take
it
into
his
head
not
to
be
knocked
over
gently?""Why
<EOS>
then
,
Jack
,
you
must
kind
<EOS>
o
'
take
it
out
agin
,
you

,

<EOS>
""Well
,
well
,
"
growled
Curdish
,
do
n't
be
gittin
'
foolish
over
it
.
<EOS>
""No
!
"
returned
the
other
drily
;
"
one
fool
in
a
party'll
do
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
"Following
<EOS>
this
last
remark
,
was
a
pause
of
some
minutes
,
when
the
conversation
was
again
renewed
by
Curdish
.
<EOS>
"I
say
,
Bill
,
what
's
yer
honest
,
disinterested
,
confidential
and
most
perticular
opinion

Ben

how?""Why
that

at
without
any

"
answered
Bill
.
<EOS>
"
I
jest
think
he
's
an
arrant
knave

<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
what?""A
<EOS>
bloody
rascal!""I'll
take
yer
fist

Bill

"
and
the
speaker
uttered
an
oath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
long
hooked
nose
he
's
got
,
haint
he
?
<EOS>
If

myself

""Hush

""Like

Jack

The

maybe
you
'll
have

<EOS>
What
is
the

goin'
to
do
with

<EOS>
I
've
told

I
ai
n't
sure
,
but
<EOS>
I
'
spect
thar
's
a
curious
design
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
bin
<EOS>
kind
o
'
watching

a

up

here

thar

guessin

on
the

,
and
<EOS>
it
looks
rayther
mysterious
,
I
tell
ye
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
old
feller
we
stuck
and
fleeced
a
few
months
back
,
and
how
old
Ben
,
not
satisfied
,
stuck
him
twice
more
,
and
then
saved
his
life
—
a
thing
he
warn't
never
known
to
do
afore
;
well
you
know
as
how
he
got
hold
o
'
some
papers
too
,
which
he
said
warn't
<EOS>
o
'
no
account
to
us
,
and
so
took
'em
for
his
share
,
which
looked
sort
o
'
curious
agin
,
and
which
bein
'
all
put
together
,
makes
me
think
as
how
them
ar
<EOS>
'
papers
,
this
gal
,
and
the
'
tother
old
feller
ar
'
all
kind

mixed
up
into
a
secret
;
for
ever
since
he
's
bin
mighty
anxious
to
git
hold
o
'
the
gal
,
and
I
overhearn
him
say
one
time
,
when
talkin
'
to
himself
,
that
he
'd
sometime
be
a
great
man
,
and
as
soon
he
could
get
the
gal
he
was
goin'
to
mizzle
and
set
sail
on
the
big
brine
.
<EOS>
""Set
<EOS>
sail
,
eh
!
"
growled
Curdish
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
as
how
he
'd
set
sail
,
did
he
?
<EOS>
Well
,
blast
me
,
if
he
do
n't
too
;
but
it
'll
be
an
ugly
voyage
he
'll
be
goin'
,
by

Curdish

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
conversation
after
this
for
something
over
an
hour
,
was
carried
on
in
a
tone
so
low
,
that
our
travelers
were
unable
to
distinguish
what
was
said
,
when
the
voice
of
Riley
was
again
heard
to
articulate:"I'm
afeard
<EOS>
this
ere
storm
's
knocked
our
calculations
all
in
the
head
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
""Hark
!
"
returned
the
other
;
"
do
n't
you
hear
'
em?""Ha
!
<EOS>
yes
,
'
tis
they
at
last
.
<EOS>
Now
be
careful
,
my
boy
,
and
jest
do
up
the
thing
safe
and
genteel
,
for
thar
's
a
few
shiners
at
stake
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
As
he
spoke
,
horses
were
heard
approaching
at
a
quick
pace
,
and
presently
the
voices
of
their
riders
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
then
,
Mark
,
"
whispered
Bernard
,
grasping
a
pistol
with
one
hand
and
his
companion
's
arm
with
the
other
,
"
jest
let
us
show
these
ere
chaps
that
there
's
other
folks
about
.
<EOS>
""Ay
!
"
returned
Tyrone
,
setting
his
teeth
hard
,
"
they
need
an
honest
man
's
lesson
.
<EOS>
"A
thrilling
scream
aroused
them
to
action
,
and
both
sprang
forward
at
once
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
was
heard
the
sharp
report
of
a
pistol
—
a
groan
—
another
scream
,
and
the
clatter
of
a
horse
's
hoofs
on
through
the
ravine
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
III.THE
LOVERS
—
THE
WARNING
—
<EOS>
THE
CAPTURE.We
must
now
go
back
in
our
narrative
,
to
a
short
time
previous
to
its
opening
in
the
first
chapter
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
road
already
mentioned
as
leading
on
through
the
ravine
,
about
ten
miles
to
the
northeast
of
the
place
described
in
the
foregoing
chapter
,
and
on
the
same
day
the
events
just
recorded
took
place
,
were
two
personages
,
well
mounted
on
a
couple
of
beautiful
horses
,
riding
along
at
a
leisure
pace
.
<EOS>
Of
the
two
,
one
was
a
young
man
,
apparently
about
twenty
years
of
age
,
of
a
fine
form
and
manly
bearing
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
well
shaped
,
open
,
frank
and
noble
,
and
of
a
high
intellectual
cast
;
while
his
bright
,
hazel
eye
sparkled
with
a
true
poetic
expression
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
was
smooth
,
broad
and
high
,
surmounted
by
dark
brown
hair
,
which
hung
in
graceful
curls
far
down
his
neck
,
giving
to
him
a
somewhat
feminine
,
though
not
unpleasing
,
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
well
dressed
—
uncommonly
so
for
this
section
of
the
country
—
in
a
fine
suit
of
black
;
the
lower
extremity
of
his
pantaloons
being
encased
in
fine
buckskin
leggins
,
while
his
head
was
covered
by
a
beautiful
cap
of
dark
silk
velvet
,
on
either
side
of
which
a
couple
of
gold
mounted
buttons
shone
conspicuously
.
<EOS>
He
rode
his
high
mettled
steed
in
that
easy
,
graceful
,
dignified
manner
,
which
sets
forth
the
rider
to
so
much
advantage
,
and
which
is
only
acquired
by
constant
practice
,
together
with
a
knowledge
of
the
rules
of
horsemanship
.
<EOS>
His
companion
was
a
female
,
elegantly
attired
in
a
riding
suit
,
and
likewise
rode
very
gracefully
.
<EOS>
Of
years
she
had
seen
some
eighteen
,
was
medium
in
stature
,
and
beautifully
formed
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
,
strictly
speaking
,
could
scarce
be
account
ed
handsome
,
for
her
features
were
not
entirely
regular
;
yet
there
was
something
so
noble
,
so
intelligent
in
the
expression
,
her
dark
blue
eyes
were
so
lit
up
with
the
fires
of
an
earnest
soul
,
that
ten
to
one
you
would
pronounce
her
beautiful
,
ere
<EOS>
the
form
of
her
features
was
distinctly
recognised
;
thus
unconsciously
awarding
another
proof
of
the
mind
's
immortal
triumph
over
matter
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
a
glossy
auburn
,
the
front
of
which
was
neatly
braided
,
brought
down
with
a
graceful
curve
below
her
ears
,
and
fastened
behind
.
<EOS>
Her
checks
were
slightly
dimpled
,
and
around
her
mouth
lingered
one
of
those
pleasing
expressions
—
a
sort
of
half
smile
—
which
,
combined
with
a
bright
flashing
eye
,
invariably
wins
upon
the
beholder
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
leads
us
to
fancy
<EOS>
there
is
an
influence
of
a
Mesmeric
nature
connected
therewith
.
<EOS>
The
country
through
which
the
two
were
traveling
,
was
mostly
level
,
and
heavily
shaded
by
thick
,
dark
woods
,
stretching
far
away
on
either
hand
,
occasionally
broken
a
little
in
places
by
the
clearing
up
of
some
settler
,
whereby
the
beams
of
the
sun
poured
gently
in
,
refreshing
to
the
eyes
of
civilization
,
as
the
cool
springs
of
water
to
the
thirsty
traveler
of
the
Arabian
Desert
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
exceedingly
warm
day
,
and
the
travelers
would
have
suffered
much
,
had
they
not
been
so
well
protected
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
,
which
already
far
advanced
toward
the
western
horizon
,
threw
the
shade
of
the
lofty
trees
directly
across
their
path
.
<EOS>
Still
the
air
was
hot
and
sultry
,
unaccompanied
by
any
cooling
breeze
,
and
although
jogging
along
at
a
very
moderate
pace
,
both
horse
and
rider
perspired
freely
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
how
refreshing
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
lady
,
as
a
cool
breeze
fanned
for
an
instant
her
heated
brow
,
rustling
the
leaves
with
that
pleasing
sound
so
delightful
in
a
forest
.
<EOS>
"
See
,
even
my
noble
Fanny
pricks
up
her
ears
,
and
seems
greatly
rejoiced
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
and
so
does
Sir
Harry
,
"
returned
her
companion
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
delightful
truly
,
after
this
intense
and
almost
suffocating
heat
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
dies
away
again
;
I
would
it
were
to
continue
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
Edward
,
let
us
be
thankful
for
a
little
,
you
know
that
is
my
motto
.
<EOS>
""True
,
Emily
,
and
<EOS>
I
agree
with
all
my
heart
.
""All
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Emily
with
emphasis
,
casting
her
head
a
little
one
side
,
and
throwing
on
him
one
of
her
peculiar
,
fascinating
glances
;
"
with
all
your
heart
,
Edward?""That
is
,
all
there
is
left
me
,
"
replied
Edward
,
with
a
meaning
smile
,
gracefully
bowing
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
,
that
indeed
!
<EOS>
well
put
in
,
Sir
Knight
!
<EOS>
but
a
little
late
withal
.
<EOS>
However
,
better
late
than
never
,
says
the
adage
,
and
I
trust
you
will
be
a
little
more
circumspect
of
speech
hereafter
.
<EOS>
""I
will
do
any
thing
you
require
,
Emily
,
"
returned
Edward
gallantly
;
"
you
have
only
to
command
to
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
,
Sir
Knight
!
<EOS>
you
are
very
proficient
in
promises
;
you
have
yielded
to
a
hard
task
-
master
,
and
I
fear
me
if
put
to
the
test
,
your
actions
would
much
belie
your
words
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
indeed
,
Emily
,
you
are
in
error
;
only
give
me
the
trial
,
and
see
if
I
do
not
produce
the
proof
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
sir
,
since
you
require
it
,
please
ride
forward
and
announce
to
the
good
inhabitants
—
if
you
should
chance
to
meet
any
—
that
a
lady
is
approaching
,
in
the
person
of
Emily
Novance
,
whose
gallant
by
her
orders
goes
before
as
a
herall
.
<EOS>
—
What
?
<EOS>
you
hesitate
!
<EOS>
is
this
the
way
I
am
to
be
obeyed
?
<EOS>
Go
,
sir
!
<EOS>
it
is
my
command!""Nay
,
but
Emily
,
this
is
unfair
.
<EOS>
""So
,
then
,
you
question
my
orders
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
fear
you
are
like
all
the
rest
of
your
sex
—
full
of
promises
,
which
doubtless
you
all
fulfil
,
when
the
fulfilment
proves
agreeable
to
yourselves
;
but
<EOS>
when
otherwise
,
ah
me
!
<EOS>
for
our
sex
;
"
and
the
speaker
shook
her
head
with
an
arch
look
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
,
now
,
Emily
;
but
I
see
you
are
determined
to
carry
the
point
your
own
way
,
so
I
will
fain
give
in
,
lest
I
get
worsted
by
argument
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
do
if
you
please
,
Sir
Knight
!
<EOS>
and
you
will
oblige
me
much
,
very
much
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
some
minutes
after
this
both
rode
along
in
silence
,
when
the
conversation
was
again
opened
by
Edward
.
<EOS>
"I
say
,
Emily
,
"
began
he
,
at
length
,
"
to
one
of
your
refined
taste
,
does
not
this
country
life
,
<EOS>
so
tone
,
so
solitary
,
in
the
woods
as
it
were
,
seem
very
irksome
?
<EOS>
Methinks
to
one
of
your
light
turn
of
mind
,
that
had
been
used
to
the
gay
crowds
which
throng
the
city
,
it
must
be
very
tiresome
,
full
of
sameness
,
causing
ennvi
and
discontent
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
lady
,
a
slight
flush
singing
her
fair
noble
features
,
while
her
eyes
sparkled
with
more
than
wonted
brilliancy
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
think
you
so
?
<EOS>
then
have
I
given
you
more
credit
for
discernment
than
you
really
possess
,
if
thus
you
judge
the
heart
of
Emily
Nevance
!
<EOS>
What
are
the
gay
crowds
of
the
city
,
of
which
you
speak
?
<EOS>
Of
what
are
they
composed
,
but
of
fops
and
fools
—
apes
of
fashion
—
walking
advertisements
for
tailors
and
milliners
—
whose
mirrors
are
their
prophets
,
and
themselves
the
only
God
they
worship!—whose
very
souls
are
confined
within
the
trappings
of
dress
,
and
know
as
little
of
what
human
beings
should
be
,
as
the
insects
that
crawl
beneath
our
feet
!
<EOS>
And
do
you
think
I
sigh
for
their
society
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
give
me
Nature
in
her
wildest
,
grandest
,
seul
-
inspiring
moods
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
away
from
the
haunts
of
men
,
let
me
contemplate
her
in
silence
,
and
in
awe
!
'
<EOS>
Tis
then
,
far
from
loncliness
,
I
feel
I
hold
communion
with
the
All
Pervading
Spirit
!
<EOS>
I
look
around
me
,
and
behold
the
works
of
One
,
compared
with
whom
,
I
sink
into
utter
insignificance
.
<EOS>
Ay
!
<EOS>
away
with
dusty
cities
!
<EOS>
Give
me
the
hills
,
the
dales
,
the
rocky
steeps
,
the
level
plains
,
the
tall
,
majestic
,
sighing
forests
,
with
the
music
of
their
creating
—
the
laughing
,
rippling
,
sunay
streams
,
that
dance
along
in
childish
glee
—
and
with
a
soul
pure
,
sinless
in
the
sight
of
God
,
I
will
rest
content
to
spend
my
days
in
holy
contemplation
.
<EOS>
""Spoken
<EOS>
like
yourself
,
Emily!—my
sentiments
,
for
the
world
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Edward
,
with
a
bright
,
enthusiastic
animation
of
countenance
that
told
the
feelings
within
more
eloquently
far
than
words
"
I
was
but
jesting
,
dear
Emily
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
,
at
all
events
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
have
you
form
such
an
opinion
of
me
as
you
first
expressed
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
said
in
a
sad
,
almost
mournful
tone
of
voice
,
while
the
speaker
bent
her
head
forward
,
and
appeared
to
be
examining
some
of
the
trappings
of
the
saddle
.
"Nay
,
never
fear
,
dear
Emily
,
that
I
will
think
aught
of
you
but
what
is
most
worthy
,
"
replied
Edward
,
in
that
deep
,
earnest
tone
of
voice
which
invariably
carries
conviction
with
it
the
speaker
is
sincere
.
"
<EOS>
But
why
,
"
continued
he
,
after
a
pause
of
some
moments
,
during
which
each
seemed
buried
in
some
deep
study
,
"
why
,
dearest
Emily
,
when
every
thing
concurs
to
prove
us
so
fitly
adapted
to
each
other
,
why
will
you
withhold
your
consent
to
be
mine
?
<EOS>
O
,
if
you
did
but
know
the
deep
,
ardent
passion
I
possess
for
you
,
methinks
you
would
not
turn
<EOS>
so
deaf
an
ear
to
all
my
<EOS>
pleadings!""There
,
Edward
,
you
do
me
wrong
,
"
replied
Emily
;
"
I
am
not
deaf
to
your
pleadings
,
far
from
it
;
nor
do
I
in
the
least
doubt
the
passion
of
which
you
speak
;
but
<EOS>
Edward
,
as
I
told
you
before
,
we
are
both
as
yet
young
,
and
I
would
rather
,
ere
you
bind
yourself
by
a
solemn
promise
,
that
you
look
more
about
you
,
lest
by
too
hasty
nuptials
you
do
an
act
which
you
may
repent
the
remainder
of
your
days
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
know
you
are
wealthy
;
I
am
not
;
and
your
parents
will
,
perchance
,
object
to
your
wedding
one
so
far
beneath
you
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
Emily
,
"
sighed
Edward
,
"
that
is
the
unkindest
word
of
all
.
<EOS>
Beneath
me
,
"
cried
he
suddenly
,
"
by
heavens
!
<EOS>
it
were
not
well
for
any
to
utter
that
in
my
presence
,
save
Emily
Nevance
!
<EOS>
Beneath
me
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
in
what
am
I
your
superior
?
<EOS>
In
gold
!
<EOS>
And
did
not
you
yourself
despise
it
but
now
,
and
all
its
idle
<EOS>
votaries?""But
<EOS>
then
,
Edward
,
you
know
the
world—""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
what
care
I
for
the
world
?
<EOS>
The
world
—
nonsense
!
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
,
and
I
stand
on
my
own
opinions
,
in
matters
of
my
own
concern
!
<EOS>
Surely
I
would
be
mad
,
or
worse
than
mad
,
to
sacrifice
my
own
happiness
to
please
the
world!""But
then
,
Edward
,
you
know
your
parents
may
think
differently
in
regard
to
the
opinions
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
some
minutes
Edward
,
mused
thoughtfully
,
before
making
a
reply
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
Emily
was
correct
in
her
surmises
,
for
his
parents
were
both
rich
and
proud
—
his
father
more
especially
—
and
he
knew
too
that
the
latter
,
in
his
own
mind
,
had
already
disposed
of
his
hand
,
to
one
he
had
never
seem
,
simply
because
she
was
a
personage
of
wealth
;
and
consequently
,
that
it
would
be
a
difficult
matter
,
even
if
done
at
all
,
to
gain
their
consent
to
his
union
with
another
,
and
furthermore
too
,
when
that
other
was
poor
;
but
still
he
loved
Emily
sincerely
,
deeply
,
and
was
fully
determined
not
to
sacrifice
his
own
happiness
to
gratify
the
caprices
of
others
,
even
were
those
others
his
parents
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
,
Emily
,
"
he
at
length
replied
,
"
depend
upon
it
,
whatever
my
parents
may
think
,
my
views
and
sentiments
shall
,
at
least
,
ever
remain
unaltered
;
and
since
you
will
not
now
sacredly
promise
to
become
mine
,
I
will
live
on
the
joyful
hope
of
some
day
winning
your
consent
—
some
day
calling
you
so
,
with
the
sanction
of
the
laws
of
both
God
and
man
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
,
"
rejoined
Emily
,
in
a
low
sweet
tone
,
with
her
eyes
cast
down
,
"
I
will
live
on
in
the
sincere
hope
,
that
should
that
day
ever
come
,
I
may
be
worthy
of
you
.
<EOS>
""Ah
,
then
you
admit—""No
!
<EOS>
for
the
present
I
admit
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
see
!
<EOS>
the
sun
is
already
nearing
the
western
horizon
,
where
black
clouds
are
looming
up
in
sullen
majesty
,
and
we
have
a
goocly
distance
yet
to
ride
.
<EOS>
Let
us
put
our
horses
to
the
spur
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
you
are
right
,
"
returned
Edward
;
"
time
flies
so
rapidly
when
with
those
we
love
we
scarcely
head
it
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
make
amends
for
our
delay
in
this
instance
,
as
I
like
not
the
looks
of
yonder
claud
,
and
methought
<EOS>
but
now
I
heard
the
distant
sound
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
"Accordingly
<EOS>
putting
spurs
to
the
noble
animals
,
they
rode
forward
at
a
fast
gallop
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
of
good
riding
brought
them
to
an
humble
cottage
,
where
,
finding
the
storm
was
likely
to
prove
detrimental
if
they
continued
their
journey
,
they
concluded
to
await
its
termination
.
<EOS>
Alighting
,
Edward
secured
the
horses
under
a
sort
of
shed
,
and
then
led
the
way
into
the
hovel
,
which
was
a
rough
,
homely
fabric
,
composed
of
logs
,
put
together
in
the
rude
,
half
-
civilized
manner
common
to
the
first
settlers
of
the
West
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
,
or
entrance
,
they
were
met
by
a
female
—
the
hostess
—
a
woman
somewhat
past
the
middle
age
,
of
rather
an
unprepossessing
appearance
,
who
gave
them
a
cold
salutation
,
and
learning
the
object
of
their
visit
,
civilly
bade
them
enter
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
the
simplest
,
coarsest
garb
of
the
day
,
and
wore
a
stern
,
haughty
,
or
rather
an
angry
look
,
which
made
her
person
appear
to
her
guests
anything
but
agreeable
.
<EOS>
The
room
which
they
entered
waslow
,
dark
,
and
dirty
;
the
ground
—
for
it
could
not
boast
of
a
floor
—
being
strewed
with
damp
,
filthy
straw
.
<EOS>
In
one
corner
was
some
of
a
fresher
,
cleanlier
appearance
;
used
,
undoubtedly
,
as
a
place
of
rest
for
the
occupants
.
<EOS>
Several
rough
benches
promiscuously
standing
about
,
together
with
a
plain
deal
table
,
a
few
pots
and
kettles
,
apparently
completed
the
stock
of
furniture
.
<EOS>
"You're
<EOS>
jest
in
time
,
"
remarked
the
hostess
,
retreating
within
,
and
pointing
our
travelers
to
one
of
the
benches
;
"
you
haint
bin
<EOS>
a
minnet
too
quick
;
for
sich
a
guster
as
we
're
goin'
to
have
<EOS>
,

seen
in
these
diggins
often
.
<EOS>
""Do
you
think
,
<EOS>
madam
,
we
shall
have
a
severe
shower
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Edward
,
casually
.
"Think
!
<EOS>
"
cried
she
contemptuously
,
drawing
herself
up
,
her
small
black
eyes
flashing
angrily
,
"
I
arn't
one
to
think
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Thar
's
goin'
to

<EOS>
Listen

The
thunder

Thar

<EOS>
d'ye
<EOS>

that
?
"
<EOS>
screamed
she
,
as
a
tremendous
crash
of
thunder
broke
over
their
heads
.
<EOS>
"
That
ar
's
the
speret
o

<EOS>
the
storm

cheering
it
on

danger
in
your

<EOS>
I
see
it
—
the
storm
—
the
woods
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
strode
to
and
fro
the
apartment
<EOS>
,
her
eyes
turned
upward
,
apparently
fixed
on
some
distant
object
,
gesticulating
,
the
while
,
in
that
wild
manner
,
which
led
our
travelers
to
believe
her
touched
with
insanity
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
stretching
out
her
long
bony
arm
,
pausing
,
and
pointing
with
her
finger
in
the
direction
she
was
gazing
,
while
with
the
other
she
seemed
to
brush
a
mist
from
before
her
eyes
,
she
exclaimed
with
vehemence
,
"
I
see
it
again
!
<EOS>
the
woods!—the
ambush
—
all
—
all
!
<EOS>
Young
folks
bewar
'
!
<EOS>
thar
's
danger
in
your
way!—be
—
"
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
,
followed
instantaneously
by
another
crash
of
thunder
,
that
made
the
old
cabin
tremble
,
here
cut
her
speech
short
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
enough
,
"
muttered
she
to
herself
,
"
if
Jack
and
Bill
only
manage
to
play
their
parts
,
I
'll
git
more
credit
for
witcheraft
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
storm
now
howled
in
all
its
fury
,
making
the
rough
old
timbers
of
the
cabin
creak
and
tremble
,
as
though
about
to
be
demolished
,
while
a
thick
,
heavy
darkness
shut
in
every
object
,
save
when
relieved
by
the
lurid
glare
of
lightaing
.
<EOS>
Edward
and
Emily
sat
mute
,
gazing
upon
the
scene
with
that
sense
of
awe
,
which
intelligent
and
sensitive
minds
ever
experience
,
when
brought
by
the
fierce
combat
of
the
elements
into
the
presence
of
the
Almighty
Spirit
of
the
Universe
.
<EOS>
Something
less
than
two
hours
served
to
clear
away
the
storm
,
when
our
travelers
prepared
to
leave
.
<EOS>
The
horses
were
found
safe
,
though
the
saddles
were
rendered
disagreeable
from
being
saturated
with
the
rain
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
being
of
minor
importance
,
they
mounted
,
thanked
the
hostess
for
her
accommodation
,
and
rode
away
—
she
the
while
repeating
:
"
Bewar
'
,
thar
's
danger
on
yer
way
!
"
<EOS>
so
long
as
they
were
within
hearing
.
<EOS>
"What
think
you
of
that
old
woman
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Emily
,
as
they
rode
along
,
carefully
picleing
their
way
,
it
still
being
dark
,
while
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
tree
felled
directly
across
their
path
,
warned
them
to
move
cautiously
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
I
scarcely
gave
her
a
thought
,
except
to
think
her
a
little
deranged
,
"
answered
Edward
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
if
what
she
vaguely
hinted
should
prove
true—""Poh
!
<EOS>
Emily
,
"
interrupted
Edward
,
"
do
not
give
it
a
thought
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
you
are
not
frightened
at
the
idle
outpourings
of
such
an
illiterate
old
woman
as
that?""I
scarcely
know
,
Edward
,
whether
I
am
or
not
.
<EOS>
But
something
weighs
heavily
on
my
spirits
,
and
I
feel
a
strange
foreboding
of
some
coming
ill
.
<EOS>
""O
,
the
effect
of
the
storm
no
doubt
;
it
will
soon
pass
away
;
come
,
come
,
do
not
be
down
-
hearted
,
the
moon
will
be
up
presently
,
and
then
we
can
move
forward
with
greater
facility
.
<EOS>
"They
now
rode
on
for
some
time
in
silence
,
occasionally
venturing
their
horses
into
a
trot
,
whenever
the
road
appeared
a
little
more
open
,
until
they
entered
the
ravine
,
where
the
trees
being
of
much
smaller
growth
,
of
a
swampy
nature
,
had
made
little
or
no
obstruction
to
their
progress
,
when
giving
their
steeds
the
reins
,
they
moved
forward
at
a
much
faster
pace
.
<EOS>
The
Maramee
,
running
along
to
their
left
,
being
much
swolen
by
the
late
rains
,
now
rolled
on
with
that
sullen
,
gloomy
,
monotonous
sound
,
which
the
turbulent
waters
of
a
flood
will
invariably
produce
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
how
gloomy
!
<EOS>
"
began
Emily
,
breaking
the
silence
they
had
for
some
time
maintained
;
"
I
shall
feel
much
relieved
when
we
pass
this
lonely
place
,
for
here
<EOS>
every
sound
seems
to
send
a
chill
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
my
spirits
,
"
returned
Edward
,
"
from
some
cause
,
are
less
buoyant
than
is
common
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
that
old
woman
could
have
any
secret
meaning
in
what
she
said
?
<EOS>
But
no
!
pshaw
!
<EOS>
what
a
foolish
idea
;
"
and
he
tried
to
laugh
,
as
if
to
shake
off
his
thoughts
,
but
the
attempt
ended
in
a
hollow
tone
,
that
sounded
strange
and
unnatural
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
,
Edward
<EOS>
,
there
was
more
in
her
words
than
you
are
willing
to
eredence
.
<EOS>
But
here
we
are
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
:
now
then
,
we
shall
leave
this
—
"
what
more
she
would
have
added
was
interrupted
by
a
scream
,
as
two
figures
,
springing
from
either
side
of
the
path
,
grasped
the
bridles
of
both
Edward
's
horse
and
her
own
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
Emily
felt
herself
seized
by
one
of
the
raffians
,
who
instantly
mounted
behind
her
—
saw
her
companion
felled
to
the
ground
—
saw
two
more
figures
rush
forward
—
heard
the
report
of
a
pistol
—
a
groan
,
and
uttering
another
wild
scream
of
fear
and
despair
,
she
was
rapidly
borne
away
into
the
dark
ravine
.
<EOS>
In
the
execution
of
this
nefarious
design
,
Curdish
was
less
successful
than
Riley
;
for
having
struck
Edward
from
his
horse
,
and
just
as
his
foot
was
placed
in
the
stirrup
to
mount
,
a
shot
from
the
pistol
of
Bernard
disabled
him
,
and
he
was
immediately
taken
prisoner
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
Edward
,
recovering
from
the
stunning
effects
of
the
blow
,
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
learning
from
Tyrone
how
matters
were
,
in
an
agitated
voice
of
deep
emotion
,
said:"Gentlemen
,
you
are
both
strangers
to
me
,
but
you
have
acted
like
men
,
and
from
my
heart
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
Some
five
miles
from
here
,
on
this
road
,
you
will
find
a
cottage
occupied
by
one
Webber
,
where
you
can
confine
this
villain
,
and
take
such
measures
as
you
may
think
proper
.
<EOS>
Inform
Webber
of
the
circumstances
,
and
say
that
Edward
Merton
has
gone
in
pursuit
of
his
ward
.
<EOS>
""His
ward
!
"
echoed
Bernard
and
Tyrone
in
a
breath
.
<EOS>
"Even
<EOS>
so
;
adieu
!
"
<EOS>
and
mounting
his
horse
,
which
stood
by
him
,
while
speaking
,
he
drove
the
spurs
into
his
sides
,
and
dashed
on
in
pursuit
of
the
kidnapper
,
with
that
wild
,
reckless
daring
,
that
uncertainty
of
purpose
,
which
hot
-
brained
youth
ever
exhibits
,
ere
subdued
by
the
stern
,
calm
teachings
of
experience
.
"Heavens
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Tyrone
,
as
Merton
rode
away
,
ere
he
was
fully
aware
of
his
purpose
;
"
his
rashness
may
spoil
all
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
<EOS>
Bernard
,
let
us
take
this
cut
-
throat
along
,
and
forward
to
Webber
's
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
""Wal
<EOS>
,
that
's
to
my
notion
exactly
,
"
returned
Bernard
.
"
<EOS>
So
,
Mr.
Jack
Curdish
,
you
did
n't
quite
come
it
<EOS>
this
ere
time
,
I
guess
,
did
ye
?
<EOS>
Pre'aps
<EOS>
you
'll
have
better
luck
agin
<EOS>

git
another
such
a
chance
.
<EOS>
If
I
's
you
,
I
would
n't
holler
and
laugh
quite
so
loud
next
time
;
I
'd
du
it
all
a
great
deal
<EOS>
more
stiller
like
<EOS>
;
I
would
,
I
swow
,
that
's
a
fact
.
<EOS>
""Curses
on
ye
!
"
growled
Curdish
between
his
clenched
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pay
ye
some
day
,
hang
me
if
I
don't!""O
<EOS>
,

no

not
a

<EOS>
I
guess
I
've
seen
chaps
<EOS>
afore
to

day
git
cured
,
when
they
got
a
little
obstropulous
,
mighty
tarnal
quick
too
;
so
come
along
with
ye
;
"
and
taking
hold
of
one
arm
,
while
Tyrone
walked
on
the
other
side
,
the
arm
of
which
was
broken
by
the
shot
of
Bernard
,
they
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
Webber
's
,
where
they
arrived
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
,
and
where
for
the
present
we
shall
leave
them

CHAPTER
IV.THE
PURSUIT
—
<EOS>
THE
INFORMATION
—
<EOS>
THE
MYSTERIOUS
STRANGERS.Wild
and
turbulent
as
the
waters
that
rushed
along
by
his
side
,
were
the
thoughts
and
feelings
crowding
the
breast
of
Edward
Merton
,
as
he
spurred
his
noble
animal
on
through
the
ravine
.
<EOS>
His
mind
was
now
a
perfect
chaos
,
where
hope
and
fear
,
love
and
revenge
,
were
alternately
struggling
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
One
thought
,
however
,
was
ever
uppermost
:
Emily
Nevance
must
be
rescued
;
but
as
to
the
manner
time
and
place
,
he
scarcely
gave
a
thought
;
for
amid
the
whirlwind
of
ideas
crowding
his
brain
,
there
were
none
of
calm
delit
ration
,
so
essential
to
the
effecting
of
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
As
he
cleared
the
ravine
and
entered
the
forest
,
he
was
very
forcibly
reminded
of
his
headlong
speed
,
by
the
stumbling
of
his
horse
against
a
tree
that
had
been
blown
partly
across
the
road
,
by
which
he
was
nearly
thrown
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Immediately
dismounting
,
and
finding
his
horse
not
materially
injured
—
having
only
in
one
or
two
places
slightly
ruptured
the
skin
—
Merton
seated
himself
upon
the
fallen
tree
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
seemed
to
hold
a
consultation
with
himself
.
<EOS>
Whatever
this
consultation
was
,
it
probably
savored
more
of
reason
than
his
former
transactions
;
for
on
remounting
he
proceeded
at
a
much
slower
pace
,
his
mind
evidently
occupied
with
matters
which
at
first
had
been
overlooked
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
,
she
must
be
saved
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
,
at
length
,
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how
is
this
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
where
can
I
find
her
?
<EOS>
for
what
purpose
is
she
thus
taken
away
?
<EOS>
Doubtless
for
some
foul
end
!
<EOS>
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
if
she
but
come
to
harm
—
but
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
think
it
—
<EOS>
it
must
not
,
shall
not
be!—and
yet
,
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
it
should
be"—and
Edward
pressed
his
hands
to
his
throbbing
,
burning
temples
,
in
an
agony
of
mind
almost
insupportable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
villain
!
<EOS>
if
he
do
but
wrong
her
,
I
swear
his
heart
's
blood
shall
answer
for
it
,
though
I
spend
a
life
in
search
for
him
!
<EOS>
But
why
do
I
idle
here
,
when
perhaps
I
may
overtake
the
ruffian
—
may
save
her
from
death
,
or
what
is
worse
,
dishonor
?
<EOS>
Gods
!
<EOS>
if
he
wrong
her
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
spoke
,
Merton
buried
the
rowels
in
the
flanks
of
the
gallant
horse
which
bore
him
,
and
again
he
was
wildly
dashing
forward
,
seemingly
forgetful
of
the
former
accident
.
<EOS>
But
he
remained
unharmed
,
and
a
few
minutes
hard
riding
brought
him
to
the
cot
which
had
protected
him
from
the
storm
,
when
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
,
he
ejaculated
,
"
Ha
!
<EOS>
I
will
know
,
"
and
immediately
reined
in
his
noble
beast
,
already
covered
with
foam
,
close
to
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
A
loud
hallo
not
serving
to
bring
any
one
to
the
door
,
he
sprang
to
the
ground
and
for
some
time
vigorously
applied
his
fist
to
it
with
no
better
success
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
about
to
remount
,
however
,
thinking
there
was
no
one
within
,
the
sound
of
smothered
voices
caught
his
ear
and
determined
him
to
continue
.
<EOS>
His
efforts
were
at
last
rewarded
by
a
somewhat
husky
voice
calling
out:"Who
's
thar'?""A
friend
!
"
replied
Merton
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
d'ye
want?""To
gain
an
entrance
.
<EOS>
""We
do
n't
never
admit
strangers
arter
night
;
call
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
delay!—my
business
is
urgent
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
d'ye
want
to
see?""Hetty
Brogan
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
the
smothered
conversation
was
again
renewed
,
which
at
length
resulted
in
the
door
being
unbolted
,
and
a
man
's
head
peeping
cautiously
out
.
<EOS>
"Ar
<EOS>
'
ye
alone
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
the
same
husky
voice
.
<EOS>
"I
am
!
"
replied
Merton
.
<EOS>
"What
brings
ye
here?""I
wish
to
question
Hetty
Brogan
.
<EOS>
""Consarning
fortins?""Yes!""Come
in
.
"Merton
<EOS>
immediately
secured
his
horse
and
entered
.
<EOS>
Some
half
smothered
embers
on
a
rude
hearth
cast
forth
a
sombrous
light
,
and
served
to
relieve
the
various
objects
from
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
Hetty
immediately
came
forward
and
enquired
of
Merton
his
business
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
I
was
here
a
short
time
since
,
"
answered
he
,
"
you
warned
me
of
danger
lying
on
my
path
,
to
which
I
then
gave
little
heed
—
for
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
thought
you
deranged
;
but
I
have
since
learned
the
sad
reality
.
<EOS>
I
was
felled
from
my
horse
by
a
ruffianly
blow
,
while
my
companion
was
kidnapped
and
borne
I
know
not
whither
.
<EOS>
It
matters
not
to
me
at
present
how
you
gained
the
knowledge
you
imparted
,
but
I
wish
to
know
more
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
if
indeed
you
can
tell
,
where
she
is
at
the
present
moment
,
or
whither
her
destination
,
and
you
shall
be
richly
rewarded
.
<EOS>
""To
tell
you
whar
'
she
is
do
n't
lay
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
Her
destination
is—""Where
?
<EOS>
where?—for
Heaven
's
sake
speak
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Merton
,
as
the
old
woman
paused
.
<EOS>
"Thar
'
,
thar
'
,
do
n't
git
in
a
passion
:
<EOS>
you
hain't
said
what
you
'd
give
to
know
;
and
I
reckon
as
how
Hetty
Brogan
arn't
one
as
tells
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Speak
,
then
!
<EOS>
old
woman
;
there
is
gold
to
unloose
the
hinges
of
your
tongue
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Merton
,
placing
in
the
hands
of
Hetty
a
well
filled
purse
,
which
she
grasped
with
avidity
and
dropped
into
a
side
pocket
;
then
motioning
him
to
a
seat
,
she
resumed:"Why
,
ye
see
,
mister
<EOS>
—
what
's
yer
name
,
sir?""No
matter
!
<EOS>
go
on
with

"
<EOS>
said
Merton
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"Ye
<EOS>
see
,
this
ere
ar
'
rather
ticklish
business
;
and
I
do
n't
much
like
the
idea
<EOS>
o
'
gitting
myself
into
a
scrape
,
which
prehaps
I
might
do
by
telling
a

want

the

,
without

<EOS>
""Do

to
say

going
to
refuse
me
the
information

you
are
already

enquired
Merton
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"Now
,
now
,
do
n't
be
gitting
angry
,
do
n't

<EOS>

only
wanted

if
some
folks
should
find
it
out

my
head

be
worth
that

"
and
she
snapped
her
fingers
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
go
on
!
<EOS>
I
promise
all
you
desire
,
on
the
honor
of

returned
Merton
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"Well

the
Jew
,
what
lives
on
the
bank
of
the
Mississippi?""Ay
!
<EOS>
heard
of
him
for
a
cut
-
throat!""Hush
!
<EOS>
not
so
loud
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
well!—speak
,
speak
!
<EOS>
what
of
him?""Thar
's
whar
'
the
gal
's
gone
.
<EOS>
""Gracious
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Merton
,
wildly
,
springing
from
his
seat
and
clasping
his
forehead
with
his
hand
;
"
surely
,
surely
not
there
!
<EOS>
My
God
!
<EOS>
what
can
be
done
?
<EOS>
I
will
fly
to
her
instantly
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
but
how
gained
you
this
information?—yet
<EOS>
no
matter!—I
will
fly
this
instant
!
"
and
Edward
bounded
to
the
door
,
where
he
suddenly
recoiled
as
though
met
by
some
repulsive
obstacle
,
while
at
the
same
instant
the
dark
figure
of
a
man
filled
the
entrance
,
and
a
deep
voice
cried
,
"
Hold
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
next
moment
the
figure
had
advanced
into
the
centre
of
the
room
and
the
door
was
again
closed
.
<EOS>
"Hetty
,
what
means
this
?
<EOS>
who
have
we
here
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
same
deep
,
stern
voice
.
<EOS>
"A
—
<EOS>
a
—
gen
—
a
stranger
,
sir
!
<EOS>
as
was
just
enquiring
his
way
to
the
river
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
stammered
Hetty
,
confusedly
,
who
on
the
entrance
of
the
last
comer
had
retreated
to
the
farther
-
side
of
the
apartment
,
where
the
darkness
screened
her
from
observation
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
you
seem
agitated
!
<EOS>
Beware
now
you
deceive
me
!
<EOS>
A
light
here!—quick
—
a
light!"The
individual
whom
we
first
noticed
as
questioning
Merton
previous
to
his
entrance
,
and
who
had
since
remained
a
silent
spectator
,
advanced
to
the
fire
and
placed
thereon
a
pine
knot
,
which
immediately
sent
forth
a
ruddy
gleam
,
lighting
the
whole
cabin
and
producing
a
picturesque
effect
.
<EOS>
A
momentary
pause
ensued
,
during
which
the
gaze
of
Merton
and
the
stranger
met
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
tall
,
commanding
in
figure
,
with
broad
massive
chest
and
limbs
to
correspond
.
<EOS>
The
outline
of
his
form
was
decidedly
handsome
,
as
was
also
that
of
his
features
,
which
although
of
a
dark
,
almost
dingy
hue
,
were
very
expressive
,
and
seemed
lit
up
with
the
fires
of
a
mighty
,
and
<EOS>
but
for
a
certain
slight
sinister
expression
,
a
noble
soul
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
dark
and
brilliant
—
his
forehead
broad
and
high
,
surmounted
by
jet
-
black
hair
,
which
fell
down
around
his
neck
in
long
glossy
ringlets
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
medium
in
length
,
with
rather
prominent
cheek
-
bones
,
cheeks
a
little
dimpled
,
from
which
ran
two
gently
curved
lines
,
terminating
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
His
lips
were
thin
and
generally
compressed
—
though
when
otherwise
,
turned
up
with
something
of
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
His
chin
rose
prominently
from
a
graceful
curve
below
his
mouth
,
on
which
was
a
handsome
imperial
,
and
ended
with
an
oval
turn
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
fashioned
much
like
a
sailor
's
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
roundabout
of
dark
blue
cloth
,
richly
embroidered
with
silk
and
tassel
,
tastefully
set
off
by
two
rows
of
gold
mounted
buttons
.
<EOS>
Underneath
of
this
<EOS>
he
wore
a
fine
blue
shirt
,
with
large
open
collar
,
falling
negligently
back
from
the
neck
,
secured
by
a
dark
silk
cravat
,
which
was
in
turn
secured
by
running
through
a
plain
gold
ring
.
<EOS>
His
nether
garments
were
in
singular
contrast
with
his
upper
.
<EOS>
His
pantaloons
of
coarse
,
dark
cloth
,
were
fastened
around
the
waist
by
a
sort
of
wampum
helt
,
in
which
were
confined
a
knife
and
two
pistols
.
<EOS>
They
came
a
little
below
his
knees
,
where
they
were
met
by
leggins
from
the
skin
of
deer
,
which
connecting
with
moceasins
,
formed
a
sort
of
rough
boot
.
<EOS>
On
his
head
he
wore
a
singular
covering
of
untanned
leather
,
shaped
something
between
a
hat
and
cap
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
his
whole
appearance
bespoke
a
man
of
a
wild
,
reckless
,
yet
withal
,
fanciful
disposition
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
stood
gazing
on
Merton
with
a
severe
expression
—
his
dark
eyes
gleaming
with
unusual
brightness
—
his
broad
forehead
gradually
contracting
into
a
frown
,
as
he
found
his
bold
gaze
returned
by
one
equally
bold
and
unquailing
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
are
you
,
and
what
is
your
business
here
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
he
,
in
the
tone
of
one
who
deems
he
has
a
right
to
know
.
<EOS>
"Ere
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
replied
Merton
,
somewhat
haughtily
,
without
removing
his
gaze
,
"
I
would
know
by
what
right
you
question
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
the
right
of
might
!
"
rejoined
the
other
quickly
,
his
dark
eyes
flashing
.
<EOS>
"Indeed!""Ay
,
sir
,
indeed
!
"
and
his
lips
parted
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
sir
,
do
not
trifle
!
"
<EOS>
he
resumed
,
again
compressing
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
unfortunate
,
speak
out
,
and
if
it
is
in
my
power
I
will
assist
you
;
but
if
you
are
beat
on
an
evil
errand
"
—
and
his
eyes
flashed
fiercely—"beware!""My
errand
is
truly
not
one
of
evil
,
and
I
am
rather
unfortunate
,
"
returned
Merton
,
struck
by
a
singular
frankness
about
the
other
,
and
thinking
he
might
perhaps
render
him
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
But
whom
have
I
the
honor
of
addressing?""I
am
called
Barton
.
<EOS>
But
go
on
!
<EOS>
go
on
!
<EOS>
I
would
know
your
story
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
hastily
.
<EOS>
Merton
simply
related
some
of
the
incidents
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Barton
—
as
Edward
concluded
his
account
of
the
kidnapping
of
<EOS>
Emily—"and
<EOS>
you
are
now
in
pursuit?""I
am
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
where
can
the
villain
have
borne
her
?
<EOS>
Here
,
Hetty
,
you
pretend
in
second
sight
,
give
us
the
desired
information!""Why
rea
-
really
sir
,
I—""Speak
,
woman
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Barton
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
;
"
he
muttered
in
an
under
tone
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
-
I
thinks
to
-
to
-
David
's
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
stammered
Hetty
,
turning
pale
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
"What
,
the
Jew
!
"
cried
Barton
,
with
a
start
.
"
<EOS>
Here
,
young
man
;
"
and
turning
to
Edward
,
he
hastily
drew
from
his
finger
a
curiously
wrought
ring
;
"
take
this
,
and
speed
!
<EOS>
speed
!
<EOS>
for
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
the
residence
of
the
Jew?""I
know
the
vicinity
,
and
can
find
it
,
"
answered
Edward
.
<EOS>
"Enough
,
then
!
<EOS>
away
,
away
!
<EOS>
for
you
have
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
Find
the
Jew
,
present
this
ring
,
and
demand
the
girl
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
refuse
your
demand
.
<EOS>
He
dare
not
!
"
<EOS>
added
Barton
,
with
strong
emphasis
,
as
he
saw
Edward
look
incredulous
.
<EOS>
"But—""Nay
,
young
man
,
no
questions
now
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
you
anon
and
explain
all
.
<EOS>
Enough
,
that
I
have
taken
a
fancy
,
and
am
willing
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
come
—
away
,
away
,
or
you
may
be
too
late
!
"
and
hurrying
Merton
from
the
house
,
Barton
assisted
him
to
mount
,
and
then
turned
away
with
an
abrupt
"
adieu
!
"
<EOS>
Once
more
burying
the
rowels
in
his
horse
,
in
an
instant
Merton
was
rapidly
speeding
on
to
the
great
river
,
lost
in
vague
conjectures
concerning
this
singular
individual
,
and
how
his
own
strange
adventure
might
terminate
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
V.THE
JEW
—
THE
KIDNAPPER
—
THE
RESCUE.On
<EOS>
the
margin
of
the
Mississippi
,
some
eight
or
ten
miles
below
St.
Louis
,
stood
,
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
an
old
,
somewhat
dilapidated
,
and
apparently
untenanted
log
hut
.
<EOS>
Although
standing
on
the
bank
of
the
river
,
it
was
well
screened
from
observation
by
thick
branching
trees
and
a
dense
shrubbery
,
which
completely
surrounded
it
.
<EOS>
The
ground
in
the
rear
of
it
was
mostly
level
;
but
in
front
,
it
abruptly
descended
to
the
river
,
which
came
sweeping
along
some
thirty
yards
below
.
<EOS>
The
hut
itself
,
on
close
inspection
,
presented
both
externally
and
internally
a
very
disagreeable
appearance
.
<EOS>
It
contained
but
one
apartment
,
if
we
except
a
place
partitioned
off
at
one
end
,
for
what
purpose
may
,
perhaps
,
be
seen
hereafter
.
<EOS>
However
ugly
and
disagreeable
the
matter
may
prove
,
dear
reader
,
it
now
becomes
necessary
for
us
to
introduce
you
within
the
precints
of
this
old
dwelling
—
for
dwelling
indeed
<EOS>
it
was
—
at
an
hour
not
the
most
agreeable
,
were
you
obliged
to
enter
corporeally
.
<EOS>
Seated
upon
an
old
stool
,
beside
a
small
table
,
on
which
his
elbow
rested
,
his
head
in
turn
resting
upon
his
hand
,
was
a
man
over
whom
some
sixty
years
had
made
their
circling
rounds
.
<EOS>
One
hand
held
a
paper
,
on
which
he
was
intently
gazing
,
while
some
few
others
were
scattered
carelessly
over
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
near
the
"
witching
time
of
night
,
"
and
a
dim
,
flickering
candle
served
to
show
the
outline
of
his
form
,
and
bring
his
features
into
a
more
bold
relief
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
strongly
marked
by
several
lines
which
depicted
cunning
and
avarice
to
a
remarkable
degree
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
small
,
dark
and
piercing
,
and
were
surmounted
by
heavy
beetling
brows
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
was
low
,
and
deeply
wrinkled
;
and
his
head
,
though
a
little
bald
,
was
generally
covered
with
long
hair
,
besprinkled
with
the
silver
touches
of
time
.
<EOS>
The
most
striking
feature
of
his
face
,
was
his
nose
;
being
long
,
pointed
and
aquiine
—
denoting
him
to
be
one
of
that
often
despised
race
,
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
His
beard
was
suffered
to
grow
,
unmolested
by
the
civilizing
touches
of
a
razor
;
was
rough
,
of
a
dirty
brown
color
;
and
came
below
his
chin
sufficiently
,
with
his
head
bent
forward
,
to
rest
on
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
His
skin
was
dark
and
filthy
,
deeply
wrinkled
,
and
begrimed
with
dirt
.
<EOS>
Altogether
his
whole
appearance
betokeued
a
man
full
of
treachery
and
deceit
;
of
dark
sinister
motives
;
and
one
who
,
to
a
person
of
the
least
refined
taste
,
would
prove
repugnant
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
He
was
seated
as
before
said
,
intently
gazing
on
a
paper
held
in
his
hand
,
which
trembling
in
the
light
,
threw
over
his
swarthy
,
hideous
features
a
flitting
shade
;
making
them
,
if
possible
,
even
more
hideous
in
expression
.
<EOS>
Gradually
his
small
,
while
a
sinister
smile
hovered
around
the
corners
of
his
mouth
,
as
he
uttered
a
low
,
chuckling
laugh
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Suddenly
starting
,
a
paleness
overspread
his
countenance
,
the
paper
dropped
from
his
hand
,
and
he
looked
hurriedly
around
the
room
,
vainly
endeavoring
to
peer
into
the
darkness
,
his
limbs
trembling
with
cowardly
fear
,
exclaiming:"Ha
!
<EOS>
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
vot
wash

?
<EOS>
O

<EOS>

<EOS>
—

hurtish

"
and
turning
to
the
table
,
he
again
took
up
the
paper
,
muttering
—
"
<EOS>
Dis

<EOS>
De

Jew
vill

mans
,
mid
a
young
handsome
wifes
;
"
and
again
he
chuckled
,
with
a
fiendish
glee
.
<EOS>
Scanning
the
papers
for
a
few
minutes
,
he
commenced
rolling
them
carefully
together
,
and
ended
by
securing
them
with
a
string
.
<EOS>
When
done
,
he
laid
the
roll
upon
the
table
before
him
,
and
gazed
upon
it
long
and
wistfully:—then
rising
from
his
seat
,
he
shuffled
slowly
across
the
apartment
,
to
the
place
already
mentioned
as
being
partitioned
off
,
where
disappearing
for
a
few
minutes
,
he
reappeared
,
returned
,
reseated
himself
on
his
stool
,
crossed
his
arms
an
the
table
,
bent
his
head
forward
,
and
,
judging
from
his
vacant
stare
,
was
soon
engaged
in
some
deep
study
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
but
dey
mush
succeeds
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
,
at
length
,
as
though
speaking
from
a
train
of
thought:—"yet
I
fears
dat
infernal
showers
will
make
it
too
mush
bad
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
vot
wash
dat
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
cried
he
suddenly
,
starting
up
and
bending
forward
in
alistening
attitude
.
<EOS>
"
Blessed
pe
Fader
Abram
!
<EOS>
dat

"
continued
he
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
chuckling
,
and
advancing
towards
the
door
,
as
a
clear
,
shrill
whistle
rang
through
the
hovel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,

Gott
!
<EOS>
mine
<EOS>
Gott
!
<EOS>
von

nows
I

"
and
he
attempted
a
feeble
imitation
at
dancing
,
which
,
with
his
stooped
figure
and
trembling
limbs
,
presented
a
spectacle
disgusting
as
it
was
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
Advancing
to
the
door
,
the
opened
it
,
gave
an
answering
signal
from
a
piece
of
ivory
which
he
applied
to
his
mouth
,
and
then
leaned
against
the
door
post
,
as
if
in
expectation
of
some
visitor
.
<EOS>
—
For
some
minutes
all
was
silent
,
and
then
came
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
,
with
which
was
occasionally
mingled
a
grunt
and
a
deep
muttered
curse
,
as
though
the
comer
was
toiling
with
some
heavy
burthen
.
<EOS>
Directly
the
figure
of
a
man
was
seen
struggling
through
the
bushes
,
bearing
a
human
body
in
his
arms
,
and
a
moment
after
,
entering
the
hovel
,
he
deposited
it
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>

.
<EOS>
""Vare
<EOS>
ish
Mistoor
Jacks
?
"
enquired
the
Jew
.
"Why
<EOS>
ye
see
,
old
feller
,
that
ar
's
much
easier
axed
,
than
answered
.
<EOS>
Most
likely
he
's
in
a
straight
jacket
by
this
time
,
if
he
arn't
already
bored
through
the
body
.
<EOS>
I
did'nt
wait
to
see
how
it
come
out
,
for
I
thought
one
was
about
as
many
as
I
could
tend
on
,
conveniently
.
<EOS>
""Vy
,
vot
dosh
you
means
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
Jew
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"O
,
nothing
much
,
only
somebody
happened
to
hear
what
was
a
goin'
on
,
and
come
up
in
a
hurry
,
pistol
in
hand
,
which
probably
went
off
accidentally
,
and
ye
see
Jack
arn't
here
;
that
's
all
I
know
about
it
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
do
you
thinks
Jacks
vosh
kilt
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
the
Jew
,
his
dark
eyes
gleaming
strangely
.
<EOS>
"Can't
<EOS>
say
—
most
likely
he
's
dead
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"A
low
,
half
-
smothered
chuckle
escaped
the
Jew
,
which
Bill
overheard
,
and
turning
fiercely
to
him
,
exclaimed:"Look
ye
here
,
old
rough
-
head
!
<EOS>
I
believe
you
're
a
most
outrageous
,
old
villainous
cut
-
throat
!
<EOS>
I
do
upon
my
honor
.
<EOS>
""Vot
<EOS>
fors
<EOS>
you
shays
dat
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
Jew
,
with
a
savage
grin
.
<EOS>
"Cause
<EOS>
I
jest
think
so
,
and
I
al'ays
like
to
speak
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Here
you
are
now
,
laughing
to
yerself
,
for
ye
darn't
<EOS>
to
laugh
out
like
a
man
,
thinking
Jack
,
poor
feller
's
,
dead
.
<EOS>
Well
,
it
's
lucky
for
you
if
he
is
:
that
's
my
opinion
about
it
.
<EOS>
""Vot
<EOS>
for
you
shays
dat
?
"
repeated
the
Jew
,
turning
a
little
pale
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
come
,
old
feller
,
not
so
fast
.
<EOS>
Bill
Riley
do
n't
peach
;
if
he
did"—and
he
looked
keenly
at
the
Jew
,
drawing
his
right
hand
obliquely
across
his
throat
,
making
a
gurgling
sound
—
"
somebody
might
get
that
ar
'
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
"
he
added
,
"
I
've
done
the
job
,
and
now
I
'll
trouble
you
for
the
chinkers
—
a
cool
hundred
,
you
remember
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
it
vosh
but
fifty
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Jew
,
starting
back
.
<EOS>
"Fifty
<EOS>
apiece
,
old
covey
,
and
thar
's
two
on
us
,
which
jest
makes
it
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
As
Jack
's
not
here
,
I
'll
jest
take
his
for
him
,
and
in
case
I
cum
across
him
,
its
easily
paid
over
,
ye
see
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
I
vill
not
not
do
so
,
"
whimpered
the
Jew
,
who
in
Jack
's
absence
thought
he
might
cheat
him
of
his
share
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
wo
n't
,
eh
?
"
exclaimed
Bill
,
advancing
to
the
table
and
returning
with
the
light
,
which
he
held
close
to
the
features
of
Emily
,
who
lay
extended
on
the
ground
,
pale
and
motionless
,
yet
even
lovely
withal
:
"
<EOS>
Look
thar
,
'
Jew
!
<EOS>
d'ye
<EOS>
see
that
ar
'
innocent
young
lady
,
whom
God
forgive
me
,
for
bringing
into
harm
's
way
!
<EOS>
D'ye
see
her
?
<EOS>
Now
look
at
me
;
"
and
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
,
bringing
the
light
full
in
front
of
his
face
,
while
the
Jew
stood
wondering:—"Look
well
!
<EOS>
d'ye
<EOS>
see
me
?
<EOS>
do
I
look
like
a
feller
that
can
be
trifled
with
?
"
<EOS>
Then
drawing
a
pistol
,
he
raised
it
to
a
level
with
the
head
of
David
,
who
turned
pale
,
trembled
,
and
threw
up
his
hands
in
an
imploring
attitude
as
he
continued
:
"
<EOS>
Now
mark
me
,
Jew
David
,
if
them
ar
'
chinkers
arn't
forthcoming
in
about
two
minutes
,
I
'll
send
a
bullet
through
your
head
,
by
—
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
concluded
with
an
oath
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
Fader
Abram
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
Jew
,
trembling
like
an
aspen
leaf
;
"
poot
down
de
pishtools
,
Mistoor
Rileys
,
and
you
shall
haves
de
monish
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
a
moment
the
other
stood
gazing
on
him
with
a
look
of
ineffable
scorn
,
and
as
he
did
so
,
the
trio
formed
a
scene
worthy
the
pencil
of
an
artist
.
<EOS>
Near
the
centre
of
the
room
was
Riley
,
his
tall
straight
form
drawn
proudly
up
,
one
foot
thrown
a
little
back
,
his
right
hand
grasping
a
pistol
,
his
left
the
light
,
which
throwing
its
gleams
upon
his
countenance
,
exhibited
it
in
strong
relief
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
not
handsome
—
strictly
speaking
—
and
yet
they
were
well
formed
;
the
outlines
bold
and
rather
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
Their
expression
was
stern
,
rather
than
villainous
,
and
his
clear
,
bold
,
grey
eyes
,
which
were
now
fastened
with
intensity
upon
the
Jew
,
spoke
more
the
courage
of
a
man
,
than
the
braggadocio
of
a
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
his
look
which
told
you
he
would
do
what
he
said
;
and
one
that
to
trifle
with
under
circumstances
like
the
present
,
would
prove
a
dangerous
individual
.
<EOS>
His
lips
thin
,
and
generally
close
drawn
over
his
teeth
,
were
now
parted
and
slightly
drawn
up
with
a
sneer
,
wherein
was
concentrated
all
the
scorn
which
a
truly
brave
man
feels
at
the
sight
of
a
whimpering
,
cowardly
ruffian
.
<EOS>
Some
two
or
three
feet
in
front
of
Riley
,
stood
the
Jew
;
his
withered
form
,
blanched
cheeks
,
quivering
lips
and
trembling
limbs
,
presenting
a
striking
contrast
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
he
,
the
dastardly
cutthroat
,
who
would
not
flinch
from
burying
the
murderer
's
dagger
in
the
heart
of
some
poor
,
unsuspecting
victim
,
now
quaked
and
trembled
at
only
the
bare
thought
of
death
overtaking
his
shriveled
,
worthless
carcase
!
<EOS>
A
little
to
the
left
of
Riley
,
lay
the
apparently
lifeless
form
of
Emily
Nevance
;
her
pale
features
looking
even
more
pale
and
death
-
like
,
as
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
fell
faintly
upon
her
lovely
,
upturned
countenance
;
while
night
formed
the
back
-
ground
,
and
compietely
encircling
them
,
threw
a
dark
veil
over
surrounding
objects
.
<EOS>
After
gazing
a
moment
on
the
Jew
,
Riley
advanced
to
the
table
,
replaced
the
light
,
seated
himself
on
the
stool
,
and
then
bade
the
Israelite
"
make
haste
with
the
chinkers
.
<EOS>
"Old
<EOS>
David
tottered
slowly
across
the
apartment
,
to
the
closet
before
spoken
of
,
groaning
at
the
very
idea
of
parting
with
so
much
money
;
but
presently
he
returned
,
bringing
with
him
a
leathern
purse
,
which
he
emptied
on
the
table
,
exclaiming;"Dare
,
Mistoor
Rileys
,
ish
all
my
monish
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
I
shall
always
more
pe
one
ruined
mans
.
<EOS>
"Riley
deigned
no
reply
,
but
cooly
commenced
counting
the
money
and
transferring
it
to
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
the
Jew
,
he
enquired
what
he
intended
to
do
with
the
lady
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
looked
at
him
steadily
for
a
moment
,
and
then
as
if
satisfied
there
was
nothing
to
fear
,
replied
,
with
a
grin
,
his
small
black
eyes
twinkling
with
savage
humor:"Vy
,
Mistoor
Rileys
<EOS>
,
I
tinks
<EOS>
I
shall
makes
her
my
vife
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
what
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Bill
,
half
starting
up
.
<EOS>
"My
vife
,
"
repeated
the
Jew
,
scarcely
knowing
whether
to
be
alarmed
or
not
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
wife
,
eh
?
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
,
ha!—that
's
capital
;
a
mighty
good
joke
that
,
old

—
ha

—
You
're
such
a
good
looking
,
soft
eyed
,
clean
faced
old
beauty
,
that
if
the

do
n't
fall
in

with

at

,
you
'll
have
the
perticular
satisfaction

knowing

<EOS>

,
anyhow
—
ha
,
ha
,
ha!""He
,
he
,

"
laughed
the
Jew
,
grinning
hideously
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
say
,
Jew
,
what
's
yer
object
in
<EOS>
throwin
'
yerself
away
at
such
a
tender
age?""Vot

"
repeated
the
Jew
,
enquiringly
.
<EOS>
"Yes

<EOS>
what
'll
ye
get
by
marryin
'
this

<EOS>
for
in

ye'll

<EOS>
""O
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
I
shall
marrys
for

,
Mistoor
Rileys
;
"
replied
the
Jew
,
with
stoical
gravity
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
love
,
eh?—ha
,
ha
,
ha!—ho
,
ho
,
ho
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Bill
,
holding
his
sides:—"For
love
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
and
again
he
went
into
convulsive
fits
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
"
Why
you
confounded
,
stupid
old
heathen
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
as
how
you
can
make

Bill

<EOS>
Do
you
really
think

anything
perticularly
verdant
about

?
<EOS>
Love

<EOS>
paugh

<EOS>
your
shrivelled
old
carcase
never
fell
in

with

unless

was
"
monish
"
attached

<EOS>
Now
jest
mark
me
!
"
<EOS>
continued
he
,
looking
steadily
at
the
Jew
,
raising
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
,
and
assuming
a
serious
tone
of
voice
:
"
Thar
's
a
mystery
connected
with
this
ere
business
,
and
per'aps
<EOS>
you
thinks
as
how
you
can
blind

,
and
per'aps
<EOS>
you
may
;
<EOS>
but
I
tell
you
one
thing
,
bewar
'
what
you
do
!
<EOS>
for
if
this
ere
gal
comes
to
harm
,
through
your
doings
,
I
,
Bill
Riley
,
swear
by
the
honor
of
a

,
to
send
a
bullet
through

loathsome

<EOS>
I
do
,
by

<EOS>
And
Jew

I
know

<EOS>
Thar

some

connected

this

's
birth
,
and
you

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Jew
started
back
,
exclaiming
:
"
<EOS>
Vy
,
how
you
finds
dat
<EOS>
outs?""Ha
!
<EOS>
then
I
'm
right
there
,
"
thought
Bill
.
—
<EOS>
"
No
matter
how
I
found
it
out
,
"
he
replied
;
"
but
<EOS>
ye
see
I
know
a
little
<EOS>
what
's
a
goin'
on
,
so
have
a
care
friend
David

<EOS>
But
enough
!
<EOS>
I
'll
have
to
begin
to
travel
;
so
good
bye
,
old
boy
,
and
jest
keep
yer
eye
skinned
for
squalls
;
"
and
rising
as
he
spoke
,
he
moved
for
the
door
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Emily
,
whom
they
supposed
lay
in
a
swoon
,
but
who
in
reality
bad
feigned
it
,
in
order
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
regarding
the
wherefore
of
her
capture
;
and
who
,
thinking
from
the
foregoing
conversation
there
might
be
something
gained
by
appealing
to
the
feelings
of
Riley
;
uttered
a
scream
,
and
sprang
into
a
sitting
posture
,
exclaiming:"Save
me
,
save
me
!
"
<EOS>
But
her
plan
did
not
succeed
.
<EOS>
Riley
,
either
fearful
of
being
discovered
,
or
that
she
might
work
upon
his
feelings
,
pushed
quickly
forward
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
As
the
door
closed
behind
the
kidnapper
,
the
Jew
looked
hurriedly
around
,
gave
a
low
chuckle
,
rubbed
his
hands
together
,
and
advanced
towards
Emily
,
who
instantly
sprang
to
her
feet
.
<EOS>
Recoiling
a
step
or
two
,
he
gazed
upon
her
with
undisguised
admiration
,
as
well
he
might
.
<EOS>
Her
beauful
figure
drawn
gracefully
up
,
the
flush
of
excitement
mounting
her
face
and
neck
with
a
ruddy
glow
,
her
proud
lip
curling
with
a
look
of
scorn
,
again
reflected
from
her
brilliant
,
dark
blue
eyes
,
as
she
crossed
her
arms
on
her
breast
and
stood
regarding
him
;
formed
a
picture
which
might
win
the
admiration
of
even
a
miserly
cutthroat
.
<EOS>
"O
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
she
does
looks
so
mush
pooty
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Jew—"Vot
a
fine
wifes!""Jew
,
"
began
Emily
,
in
a
dignified
tone
,
"
<EOS>
what
means
this
?
<EOS>
why
have
I
been
brought
hither?"For
a
moment
the
Jew
looked
at
her
steadily
,
and
as
he
did
so
,
his
ugly
features
contracted
into
a
grin
,
followed
by
a
low
chuckle
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
ish
very
mush
pootish
,
gal
<EOS>
,
"
he
replied
,
"
and
Ben
David
vill
makes
you
his
wifes
.
<EOS>
""Never
!
"
cried
Emily
,
in
a
voice
so
loud
,
bold
and
firm
,
that
the
Jew
involuntarily
started
back
"
Never
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
become
your
wife
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
sooner
would
I
die
a
thousand
deaths!""O
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
she
does
looks
so
mush
pootish

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
old
David
,
recovering
from
his
surprise
as
Emily
ceased
,
and
gazing
upon
her
with
a
doting
look
of
exultation
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
young
ladish
,
we
vill
takes
a
walk
,
"
continued
he
,
approaching
and
taking
hold
of
her
arm
,
which
she
threw
off
with
a
contemptuous
look,—at
the
same
time
drawing
a
dagger
from
the
folds
of
her
dress
,
while
the
Jew
again
started
suddenly
back
,
she
exclaimed
:
<EOS>
Beware
,
Jew
,
beware
!
<EOS>
It
were
better
for
you
to
beard
a
lion
in
his
den
,
than
a
woman
armed
,
in
my
situation
.
<EOS>
Do
not
attempt
to
touch
me
with
your
foul
,
polluted
hands
,
or
your
much
fouler
soul
,
thrice
damned
with
sin
,
with
all
its
hideous
weight
of
guilt
,
shall
wing
its
flight
and
stand
arraigned
before
the
bar
of
the
eternal
God
!
<EOS>
And
Jew
,
"
continued
she
solemnly
,
"
there
is
a
God

<EOS>
and
one
of
justice
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
sudden
the
action
,
so
bold
the
movement
,
so
solemn
the
tone
of
Emily
,
all
combined
,
took
the
Jew
completely
by
surprise
;
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
,
gazing
upon
her
dark
blue
,
soul
-
speaking
eyes
,
with
alook
<EOS>
wherein
was
blended
all
the
awe
,
admiration
and
respect
,
which
one
like
him
was
capable
of
expressing
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
for
a
moment
however
.
<EOS>
A
dark
shade
suddenly
flitted
across
his
forehead
;
his
eyes
shot
forth
strange
,
savage
gleams
;
his
lips
quivered
,
as
he
attempted
to
compress
them
over
his
almost
toothless
gums
,
and
he
bent
on
Emily
a
look
so
full
of
the
expression
of
a
fiend
,
that
she
felt
her
eye
quail
,
while
the
blood
receded
to
her
heart
and
a
tremor
of
secret
terror
ran
throughout
her
system
.
<EOS>
Applying
the
ivory
to
his
lips
,
the
Jew
gave
a
peculiar
whistle
,
which
was
immediately
answered
from
without
.
<EOS>
A
minute
later
,
two
figures
entered
the
doorway
;
and
ere
Emily
had
fairly
comprehended
what
was
going
forward
,
she
found
herself
pinioned
in
the
grasp
of
two
ruffians
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
she
,
"
all
is
lost
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
uttered
a
heart
-
piercing
scream
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
chuckled
merrily
,
and
advancing
toward
her
,
until
she
felt
his
very
breath
on
her
face
,
said:"You
looks
very
mush
more
pootish
;
"
and
he
attempted
to
press
his
loathsome
lips
against
her
face
.
<EOS>
Recoiling
as
much
as
lay
in
her
power
—
each
wrist
being
grasped
by
the
strong
arm
of
a
man
—
Emily
managed
to
evade
what
she
would
have
suffered
death
sooner
than
permitted
,
a
kiss
from
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
she
thought
of
Edward
,
and
scarcely
knowing
why
,
she
called
upon
his
name
for
help
.
"Vot
<EOS>
fors
<EOS>
you
calls
?
"
chuckled
the
Jew
.
"
<EOS>
Mistoor
Edwards
vill
not
comes!""'Tis
a
lie
!
<EOS>
"
uttered
a
deep
,
manly
voice
,
that
made
Emily
scream
for
joy
,
as
the
figure
of
a
man
sprang
quickly
forward
,
a
pistol
in
either
hand
,
still
exclaiming:—"Back
,
fiends
of
hell
!
<EOS>
back
!
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
I
send
a
bullet
through
your
brains
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
next
instant
Emily
was
clasped
in
the
arms
of
Edward
Merton
,
who
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
with
all
the
wild
foundness
of
a
first
passionate
love
.
<EOS>
After
leaving
Merton
in
the
previous
chapter
,
he
had
ridden
quickly
forward
,
but
had
been
somewhat
delayed
,
as
the
exact
location
of
the
old
hut
was
unknown
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
secured
his
horse
at
a
short
distance
,
and
was
searching
along
the
bank
of
the
river
,
assisted
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
which
pouring
down
her
silvery
flood
of
light
,
gave
to
each
thing
a
calm
and
pleasing
effect
—
when
the
scream
of
Emily
arresting
his
attention
,
effectually
enabled
him
to
find
the
house
;
which
being
completely
surrounded
by
trees
and
bushes
,
had
thus
far
eluded
his
observation
.
<EOS>
Instantly
springing
forward
,
he
reached
the
entrance
just
in
time
to
hear
the
voice
of
her
he
loved
,
in
tones
that
went
to
his
very
soul
,
calling
on
him
for
help
,
and
the
taunting
reply
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
Mad
,
almost
,
with
hope
,
rage
and
fear
combined
,
he
entered
as
described
;
but
so
suddenly
,
and
unexpectedly
,
that
the
ruffians
relaxed
their
hold
and
retreated
to
the
farther
side
of
the
apartment
;
while
the
Jew
,
not
knowing
what
he
had
to
fear
,
stood
trembling
with
very
fright
.
<EOS>
Seeing
there
was
but
one
,
however
,
he
somewhat
recovered
,
exclaiming:"Vy
you
do
n't
sheize
him
?
<EOS>
vot
fors
you
ish
afraids?""Off
,
ruffians
,
off
!
<EOS>
or
by
heavens
you
journey
to
another
world
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Merton
,
springing
in
front
of
Emily
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
for
you
,
old
dastardly
cutthroat
!
"
continued
he
,
turning
to
David
,
as
the
ruffians
paused—"I
have
a
word
to
say
,
which
you
will
do
well
to
heed
!
<EOS>
This
girl
I
demand
by
virtue
of
this
ring
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
spoke
,
he
presented
the
one
given
him
by
Barton
.
<EOS>
Whether
Merton
expected
this
to
have
any
effect
on
the
Jew
or
not
,
certain
it
is
that
he
was
very
much
surprised
at
the
singular
change
it
did
effect
;
for
the
Jew
instantly
advanced
in
a
fawning
manner
,
while
the
ruffians
slunk
quietly
away
.
<EOS>
Content
that
his
purpose
was
gained
,
without
seeking
the
mysterious
cause
,
Merton
,
accompanied
by
Emily
,
quitted
the
hovel
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
followed
them
to
the
door
,
whispering
them
a
good
night
,
pleasant
journey
and
so
forth
,
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
offer
his
service
as
a
guide
,
which
of
course
was
declined
.
<EOS>
As
Merton
entered
the
bushes
,
he
looked
back
and
saw
the
Jew
standing
in
the
doorway
,
his
face
upturned
as
though
gazing
at
the
stars
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
cloud
which
had
obseured
the
rays
of
the
moon
passed
,
and
the
light
streaming
full
upon
his
countenance
,
exhibited
features
so
wrought
up
in
expression
with
all
that
was
dark
,
treacherous
and
devilish
,
that
in
Merton
's
estimation
the
owner
was
well
worthy
to
become
the
master
fiend
of
hell
itself
.
<EOS>
A
short
walk
of
a
few
minutes
brought
them
to
the
spot
where
Merton
had
left
his
horse
,
when
to
the
surprise
of
both
,
they
found
the
one
Emily
had
ridden
standing
along
side
.
<EOS>
Merton
accounted
for
this
by
supposing
that
the
kidnapper
,
either
forgetting
,
or
not
having
any
further
use
,
had
left
her
at
liberty
,
when
attracted
by
the
neighing
of
Sir
Harry
she
had
sought
him
out
.
<EOS>
Assisting
Emily
to
mount
,
he
was
soon
once
more
astride
his
own
fine
steed
;
and
moving
away
with
lightened
hearts
,
they
were
shortly
traversing
a
path
which
led
on
toward
Webber
's
,
engaged
in
mutual
explanations
of
what
had
occurred
to
each
in
the
others
absence
;
and
if
in
doing
so
,
Merton
did
ride
a
little
closer
to
the
side
of
Emily
than
was
actually
necessary
—
and
if
when
the
moon
shone
full
on
her
fair
countenance
,
he
did
bend
forward
and
gaze
thereon
with
a
look
of
fondness
that
told
of
holy
love
,
drinking
in
the
glances
of
her
dark
blue
eyes
—
and
if
in
attempting
to
lay
hold
of
her
bridle
-
rein
,
to
guide
her
horse
in
the
better
path
,
he
sometimes
touched
her
hand
,
pressing
it
within
his
own
,
and
whispered
words
so
soft
and
low
<EOS>
the
very
zephyrs
could
not
catch
their
import
,
causing
her
head
to
droop
,
while
a
rosy
tint
sprang
brightly
o'er
<EOS>
her
face
,
—
is
it
anything
that
the
reader
should
stop
to
wonder
at
?
<EOS>
We
think
not
.
<EOS>
Very
few
but
would
have
done
the
same
under
like
circumstances
.

CHAPTER
VI.WEBBER
AND
HIS
FAMILY
—
RETROSPECTION
—
MYSTERY
—
EMILY
NEVANCE.About
five
miles
from
the
place
where
our
tale
first
opens
and
in
a
southwesterly
direction
,
stood
a
neat
cottage
,
in
size
and
appearance
greatly
the
superior
of
the
generality
of
these
buildings
,
erected
in
this
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
It
was
composed
of
logs
<EOS>
it
is
true
,
but
then
parts
of
them
were
hewn
and
put
together
with
compactness
and
regularity
,
while
the
crevices
were
neatly
filled
with
a
clay
-
like
substance
.
<EOS>
The
roof
was
pierced
by
a
chimney
built
of
stone
,
and
was
well
thatched
with
straw
.
<EOS>
A
stranger
,
after
traveling
through
much
of
the
surrounding
country
,
would
have
been
struck
with
the
air
of
taste
and
elegant
neatness
belonging
to
it
,
compared
with
the
more
slovenly
appearance
of
many
of
its
neighbors
.
<EOS>
The
ground
round
about
,
was
generally
level
,
of
a
fertile
order
,
and
exhibited
marks
of
fruitful
tillage
.
<EOS>
In
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
cottage
,
grass
had
sprung
up
,
forming
a
thick
green
sward
,
a
sure
indicative
of
civilization
.
<EOS>
A
few
fences
,
rough
it
is
true
,
but
still
answering
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
designed
,
marked
out
the
fields
of
tillage
,
and
secured
the
crops
from
the
invasion
of
cattle
.
<EOS>
In
the
rear
of
the
cottage
,
was
formed
a
garden
;
back
of
which
,
in
orchard
regularity
,
were
set
out
various
kinds
of
domestic
trees
—
such
as
the
apple
,
pear
,
peach
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
Opposite
the
house
,
some
hundred
yards
distant
,
was
a
barn
,
built
of
logs
,
where
the
cattle
could
find
shelter
from
the
rough
storms
of
winter
.
<EOS>
In
front
of
the
house
ran
the
road
before
mentioned
,
which
wound
over
a
hill
a
short
distance
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
the
whole
betokened
the
owner
a
farmer
of
the
first
class
,
bred
in
some
of
the
Eastern
States
,
who
had
come
to
the
"
Far
West
"
with
the
intention
of
here
passing
the
remainder
of
his
days
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
fact
;
and
although
in
speaking
of
him
and
his
family
,
we
may
digress
a
little
from
the
main
story
,
we
trust
the
reader
will
deem
such
digression
pardonable
.
<EOS>
William
Webber
was
a
man
in
size
far
above
the
ordinary
—
standing
six
feet
one
inch
,
with
limbs
and
body
well
proportioned
.
<EOS>
In
years
he
numbered
some
forty
-
five
,
with
a
robust
,
healthy
look
about
his
face
that
would
have
set
him
five
years
younger
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
remarkable
in
his
countenance
,
which
was
open
and
frank
in
expression
,
wherein
was
likewise
written
a
look
of
honest
hospitality
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
light
,
with
light
-
brown
hair
,
cut
close
and
combed
up
above
a
high
,
intellectual
forehead
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
grey
,
full
,
and
very
expressive
,
as
were
his
features
generally
.
<EOS>
Around
his
mouth
were
a
few
lines
that
denoted
firmness
,
when
roused
,
with
courage
to
act
;
while
his
features
exhibited
a
calm
self
-
possession
that
would
be
of
very
material
service
to
one
in
the
hour
of
peril
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
born
and
bred
in
the
good
old
State
of
Massachusetts
,
where
he
lived
in
comfortable
circumstances
,
until
about
five
years
previous
to
the
opening
of
our
story
;
when
following
up
a
desire
he
had
for
sometime
entertained
,
he
came
to
the
West
,
purchased
the
land
where
he
now
resided
,
built
the
cottage
,
returned
,
and
soon
removed
his
family
hither
;
which
consisted
of
a
wife
and
two
sons
—
one
now
aged
twenty
,
the
other
some
three
years
his
elder
.
<EOS>
His
wife
was
a
robust
,
healthy
looking
woman
,
some
five
years
his
junior
,
of
the
medium
height
,
very
fleshy
,
with
a
full
,
round
,
good
-
natured
-
looking
countenance
,
such
as
we
behold
almost
daily
,
and
one
to
whom
the
adage
,
"
fat
,
fair
and
forty
,
"
would
be
truly
applicable
.
<EOS>
The
eldest
son
,
John
,
in
some
respects
resembled
his
father
—
tall
,
well
-
built
,
with
features
of
a
similar
shape
,
though
in
expression
far
different
.
<EOS>
In
saying
there
was
a
resemblance
between
him
and
his
father
,
we
wish
the
reader
to
distinctly
understand
it
was
only
in
the
formation
of
the
features
—
all
else
being
totally
different
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
dark
,
with
jet
black
hair
,
and
eyes
somewhat
shaded
by
dark
,
heavy
,
overhanging
brows
.
<EOS>
Around
his
mouth
were
lines
similar
to
those
of
his
father
,
yet
taking
more
of
a
sinister
turn
.
<EOS>
His
look
generally
,
was
that
of
a
man
dark
,
deep
,
and
treacherous
,
and
one
little
likely
to
inspire
confidence
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
when
he
smiled
,
which
he
did
but
seldom
,
that
you
would
have
been
the
most
struck
by
an
expression
from
which
you
would
involuntarily
recoil
,
as
from
the
gaze
of
a
deadly
serpent
.
<EOS>
From
youth
up
,
John
had
been
a
being
isolated
as
it
were
from
the
world
,
wrapped
up
in
his
own
dark
thoughts
,
communing
but
seldom
with
any
,
and
then
with
those
of
a
disposition
like
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
Already
had
he
caused
his
father
much
anxiety
and
trouble
;
and
was
,
in
fact
,
one
cause
of
his
removing
to
the
West
,
where
he
thought
he
would
be
free
from
the
snares
and
temptations
likely
to
be
thrown
around
him
in
the
East
,
and
where
as
he
supposed
he
would
be
free
at
least
from
companions
in
vice
,
and
where
,
to
sum
up
,
he
would
in
all
probability
spend
his
days
in
honest
pursuits
.
<EOS>
Could
the
first
design
of
his
father
have
been
strictly
carried
out
,
viz
:
that
of
removing
him
from
temptation
,
bad
company
,
and
so
forth
,
the
latter
might
perchance
have
followed
.
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
in
selecting
the
West
,
and
more
especially
this
part
of
it
,
he
undesignedly
opened
a
field
for
the
cultivation
of
his
son
's
natural
disposition
,
by
throwing
him
among
the
most
depraved
villains
of
which
society
could
boast
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
an
apt
scholar
,
the
sequel
of
our
story
will
probably
show
.
<EOS>
His
brother
Rufus
,
younger
by
three
years
,
was
of
a
make
and
disposition
in
every
respect
totally
different
.
<EOS>
In
stature
he
was
of
the
medium
size
,
straight
and
slim
,
with
light
hair
,
and
a
fair
,
sunny
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
regular
,
approaching
perhaps
a
little
too
much
<EOS>
the
feminine
,
with
such
an
open
,
expressive
frankness
of
look
,
that
your
confidence
was
immediately
won
.
<EOS>
His
disposition
was
mild
and
affable
,
his
voice
rich
and
musical
in
tone
,
while
his
full
blue
eyes
not
unfrequently
flashed
forth
gleams
of
a
lofty
intellect
.
<EOS>
Around
his
mouth
also
,
were
lines
similar
to
those
of
his
father
,
expressive
of
firmness
and
a
determination
of
character
.
<EOS>
There
is
one
other
of
whom
we
must
speak
to
complete
the
family
,
in
order
to
do
which
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
go
back
somewhat
in
our
narrative
.
<EOS>
About
fifteen
years
prior
to
the
date
of
our
story
,
a
stranger
,
accompanied
by
a
little
girl
some
three
years
of
age
<EOS>
,
cailed
late
one
evening
at
the
residence
of
Webber
,
and
requested
permission
to
tarry
through
the
night
,
which
request
was
granted
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
dark
,
stern
looking
man
,
some
thirty
-
five
years
of
age
,
and
of
a
moody
,
taciturn
disposition
.
<EOS>
But
little
was
gleaned
from
his
conversation
,
as
to
who
he
was
or
<EOS>
whence
he
came
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
he
asked
permission
for
the
child
to
remain
a
few
days
,
stating
as
a
reason
that
business
of
importance
called
him
away
.
<EOS>
The
permission
was
granted
and
he
took
his
leave
,
since
when
he
had
never
been
heard
from
.
<EOS>
Enquiries
were
instituted
by
Webber
,
but
nothing
authentic
had
ever
been
heard
concerning
him
.
<EOS>
A
man
answering
his
description
was
seen
a
short
time
after
in
the
western
part
of
New
York
,
apparently
bound
for
the
West
;
and
Webber
came
to
the
conclusion
the
child
had
been
voluntarily
deserted
;
the
more
so
,
as
on
questioning
her
,
the
account
she
gave
was
of
harsh
treatment
,
and
sometimes
severe
chastisement
,
for
asking
of
home
.
<EOS>
The
child
was
too
young
to
give
even
a
succinct
detail
of
her
adventures
,
remembering
only
some
of
the
more
glaring
,
such
as
the
dark
man
carrying
her
away
from
home
,
putting
her
in
a
house
that
floated
on
the
water
,
and
the
like
—
from
all
of
which
Webber
drew
his
conclusions
that
she
had
been
brought
from
another
country
,
perhaps
across
the
Atlantic
,
by
an
intrigueing
design
he
was
unable
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
riddle
too
deep
for
the
gossips
infesting
the
neighborhood
of
Webber
(
as
what
place
do
they
not
)
to
solve
,
concerning
who
was
the
child
,
who
were
her
parents
,
where
she
came
from
,
and
so
forth
;
and
after
various
conjectures
,
probable
and
improbable
,
they
finally
agreed
that
her
parents
were
no
better
than
they
should
be
,
and
that
being
of
that
doubtful
cast
,
it
were
better
to
shun
the
company
of
the
child
,
lest
by
intercourse
their
prudish
decorum
should
be
vielated
,
and
their
over
-
wise
virtuous
principles
become
contaminated
.
<EOS>
So
much
for
ye
,
moth
-
eaters
of
reputation
colleagues
of
idleness
and
breeders
of
scandal
!
<EOS>
—
who
"
strain
at
a
knat
and
swallow
a
camel
"
—
blasting
all
with
your
polluted
breath
whom
the
world
hath
not
acknowledged
above
your
reach
—
preying
upon
society
as
the
worm
will
sooner
or
later
prey
upon
your
corrupted
flesh!—God
send
that
the
innocent
and
harmless
wanderer
be
not
caught
within
your
damning
toils!If
the
child
was
shunned
by
some
,
she
was
not
by
all
;
for
Webber
,
to
whom
she
soon
became
an
object
of
affection
,
determined
to
rear
her
as
though
she
were
his
own
;
and
as
she
grew
older
,
he
had
no
cause
to
regret
it
;
for
naturally
of
a
sweet
,
affectionate
disposition
,
she
won
friends
among
those
who
were
at
first
disposed
to
treat
her
uncivilly
,
while
to
Webber
she
clung
with
all
the
fondness
of
a
child
to
a
parent
.
<EOS>
Time
in
the
meanwhile
rolled
on
,
and
what
at
first
created
a
great
commotion
among
the
gossips
,
gradually
wore
away
,
settled
down
into
a
shake
of
the
head
whenever
the
object
of
calumny
approached
,
until
at
length
,
won
over
in
spite
of
themselves
by
her
angel
disposition
,
even
the
retailers
of
scandal
ceased
their
persecutions
and
the
unknown
wanderer
<EOS>
became
an
object
of
general
regard
.
<EOS>
About
this
period
an
event
took
place
,
which
created
another
mighty
sensation
,
although
gossip
this
time
ran
in
a
very
different
channel
from
the
previous
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
calm
summer
evening
in
the
month
of
August
.
<EOS>
The
sun
had
just
retired
behind
the
Western
hill
,
and
was
yet
tipping
the
mountain
tops
with
a
rich
golden
tint
;
the
songsters
were
singing
their
farewell
songs
for
the
night
;
the
breeze
came
with
that
gentle
,
soothing
effect
,
so
delightful
on
such
an
eve
,
making
one
feel
that
placid
,
yet
saddened
happiness
,
which
wins
our
thoughts
from
the
darker
things
of
life
,
and
directs
them
into
a
higher
,
nobler
,
holier
vein
.
<EOS>
Around
the
porch
of
Webber
's
dwelling
were
seated
himself
,
wife
,
and
two
children
—
one
a
fair
-
haired
boy
of
winning
appearance
,
the
other
a
girl
of
bright
eyes
and
golden
tresses
,
whose
age
might
be
thirteen
.
<EOS>
In
the
countenance
of
the
latter
there
was
something
so
noble
,
so
fascinating
,
combined
with
such
a
quiet
,
thoughtful
,
almost
melancholy
air
,
that
ten
to
one
a
stranger
would
have
paused
to
wonder
why
one
so
young
should
bear
the
look
of
maturer
years
.
<EOS>
As
Webber
gazed
upon
her
,
and
mused
on
her
sad
,
singular
fate
—
torn
from
home
and
friends
at
so
early
an
age
—
thrown
upon
the
world
for
protection
,
and
thought
what
if
such
had
been
the
case
with
one
of
his
own
children
,
he
involuntarily
hove
a
sigh
,
and
vowed
to
watch
over
her
with
more
than
a
parent
's
care
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
attention
of
the
group
,
which
had
been
occupied
in
various
ways
,
was
arrested
by
the
rapid
approach
of
a
horseman
.
<EOS>
A
minute
later
he
was
standing
among
them
,
his
horse
foaming
and
panting
from
hard
riding
,
while
with
his
own
head
uncovered
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
heated
brow
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
your
name
Webber
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
he
of
that
individual
.
<EOS>
"It
is
.
<EOS>
""William
<EOS>
Webber?""The
same
.
<EOS>
""Ten
years
ago
a
stranger
left
with
you
a
little
girl
:
<EOS>
am
I
<EOS>
right?""You
are
,
"
answered
Webber
,
wondering
what
was
to
be
revealed
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
child
;
"
and
he
pointed
towards
her
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
turned
an
enquiring
glance
,
examined
her
attentively
from
head
to
foot
,
apparently
much
struck
by
her
appearance
,
and
then
said
abruptly
:
"
Enough
!
<EOS>
I
am
commanded
to
deliver
you
this
packet
;
"
saying
which
he
placed
a
sealed
package
in
Webber
's
hand
—
turned
—
mounted
his
horse
—
dashed
the
spurs
into
his
sides
,
and
ere
the
astonished
group
had
recovered
from
their
surprise
,
he
was
fast
speeding
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"Strange
<EOS>
,
"
remarked
Webber
,
breaking
the
seal
;
"
what
new
mystery
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
opened
the
parcel
,
and
was
surprised
to
find
ten
one
hundred
dollar
notes
,
accompanied
with
the
following
singular
epistle:"To
William
Webber
,
<EOS>
greeting:—Ten
years
since

placed

your

In

<EOS>
"CHAPTER
VI.Great
was
the
wonderment
among
the
gossips
,
when
the
news
went
forth
of
Emily
's
great
fortune
,
—
for
rumor
soon
swelled
it
into
a
fortune
—
and
the
following
six
months
were
employed
by
all
the
unmarriageable
spinsters
and
old
ladies
with
spectacles
,
in
conjectures
and
discussions
as
to
the
strange
singularity
of
such
an
event
;
and
she
who
had
in
her
earlier
years
been
considered
in
birth
far
beneath
them
,
was
now
,
by
this
incident
,
placed
far
above
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
inconsistency
of
human
beings!A
new
epoch
was
now
opened
to
Emily
;
for
Webber
,
punctual
to
what
he
considered
a
duty
,
took
immediate
steps
to
place
her
in
one
of
the
best
institutions
in
the
city
of
New
York
,
in
charge
of
a
distant
relative
,
who
,
moving
in
the
best
circles
of
society
,
gave
her
not
only
the
advantages
of
intellectual
education
,
but
also
that
of
acquiring
the
ease
,
grace
and
dignity
belonging
to
the
true
etiquette
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
disposition
of
Emily
,
Webber
made
a
tour
to
the
West
,
purchased
a
farm
as
already
shown
,
and
removed
thither
with
his
family
.
<EOS>
Four
years
passed
,
and
Emily
saw
nothing
of
the
Webbers
.
<EOS>
During
this
period
she
had
grown
to
womanhood
,
and
what
had
promised
so
well
when
young
,
was
amply
fulfilled
in
maturer
years
.
<EOS>
She
became
attractive
in
person
,
graceful
in
accomplishments
,
while
her
intellectual
faculties
far
exceeded
ordinary
minds
.
<EOS>
Her
temperament
was
truly
poetic
,
with
nothing
of
affectation
or
coquetry
(
which
spoils
so
many
)
in
her
manner
.
<EOS>
—
She
was
a
warm
patriot
and
enthusiast
;
and
when
conversing
on
some
noble
theme
,
dull
must
be
the
eye
that
would
not
flash
,
or
the
mind
that
would
not
fire
,
with
the
inspiration
thrown
from
her
speaking
eyes
and
glowing
flowery
language
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
New
York
that
Edward
Merton
,
then
a
student
in
the
University
,
first
became
acquainted
with
Emily
;
and
struck
,
we
might
add
fascinated
,
with
manners
and
appearance
so
far
above
the
gay
flirting
things
with
which
she
was
surrounded
<EOS>
,
he
sought
,
gained
an
introduction
,
and
almost
immediately
commenced
paying
her
his
addresses
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
those
addresses
,
thus
far
,
the
reader
has
already
seen
.
<EOS>
Although
it
was
generally
believed
that
Emily
was
rich
,
yet
she
knew
to
the
contrary
;
and
possessed
of
a
pride
too
noble
to
take
advantage
of
such
a
reputation
,
she
,
through
a
sensitive
delicacy
,
repulsed
the
advancements
often
made
by
those
whom
she
considered
her
superiors
in
point
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
Wealth
was
certainly
a
great
bar
to
the
progress
of
Merton
;
a
bar
<EOS>
,
in
fact
,
which
he
found
far
more
difficult
to
pass
than
he
at
first
supposed
;
and
although
his
nobleness
of
heart
,
his
sincere
,
ardent
passion
,
inspired
within
her
own
breast
feelings
of
affection
—
of
love
—
yet
pride
prevailed
;
and
Merton
,
to
whom
she
revealed
her
scruples
,
saw
with
painful
regret
that
unless
there
were
some
counteracting
power
,
Emily
might
love
,
but
would
never
consent
to
be
his
.
<EOS>
Tired
of
city
life
,
and
the
gay
frivolties
of
the
day
,
Emily
longed
for
the
quiet
retreat
of
her
guardian
;
and
having
made
preparations
to
that
effect
,
about
six
months
prior
to
the
opening
of
our
story
,
she
,
accompanied
by
Merton
,
whose
father
resided
in
St.
Louis
,
set
out
for
the
West
.
<EOS>
Happy
,
most
happy
,
was
the
meeting
between
Emily
and
her
friends
,
who
had
been
to
her
as
parents
and
brothers
.
<EOS>
Webber
,
when
he
came
fairly
to
recognise
the
"
long
lost
one
,
"
as
he
termed
her
,
could
scarcely
restrain
himself
for
joy
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Even
John
,
as
he
extended
the
hand
of
welcome
,
seemed
to
smile
with
less
of
deceit
and
more
of
earnestness
than
was
his
wo
nt
;
while
Rufus
approached
her
with
that
bashful
timidity
,
almost
amounting
to
awe
,
which
persons
of
sensitive
minds
often
exhibit
when
they
fancy
themselves
in
the
presence
of
their
superiors
.
<EOS>
A
great
change
had
been
wrought
in
the
personal
appearance
of
Emily
.
<EOS>
She
had
left
them
as
it
were
a
child
,
and
as
such
they
remembered
her
;
consequently
there
was
surprise
mingled
with
their
joy
,
to
behold
such
a
fine
,
graceful
,
lady
-
like
form
,
combined
with
such
ease
and
dignity
of
manner
,
returned
in
place
of
the
image
on
which
memory
still
dwelt
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
enter
into
details
here
,
therefore
let
it
suffice
,
that
up
to
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
our
story
,
things
had
run
on
smoothly
.
<EOS>
Merton
,
whose
collegiate
course
was
finished
,
was
now
preparing
to
practice
law
in
St.
Louis
;
but
sometimes
finding
bright
eyes
a
much
more
pleasing
study
,
not
unfrequently
wandered
off
in
the
direction
of
Webber
's
;
and
almost
as
frequently
,
through
a
singular
coincidence
,
he
and
Emily
might
be
seen
mounted
on
their
fine
steeds
,
scouring
the
country
in
various
directions:—in
fact
<EOS>
,
it
was
on
one
of
these
excursions
,
in
which
they
were
first
introduced
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
As
their
proceedings
since
then
have
been
made
known
,
we
trust
sufficient
has
been
said
to
justify
us
in
proceeding
with
our
tale
.

WITH

—
<EOS>
MORE
MYSTERY.At
<EOS>
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
the
unsettled
state
of
the
country
required
every
settler
to
be
as
much
as
possible
on
his
guard
,
and
for
this
purpose
Webber
had
provided
his
house
with
a
heavy
oaken
door
,
strengthened
still
more
by
cross
bars
of
iron
,
through
which
passed
bolts
of
the
same
solid
material
.
<EOS>
The
windows
were
protected
by
shutters
similar
to
the
door
,
and
when
closed
,
which
could
be
done
almost
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
the
house
,
manned
by
a
few
within
,
seemed
of
sufficient
strength
to
withstand
a
regular
seige
.
<EOS>
A
few
loop
-
holes
,
cut
here
and
there
,
would
enable
those
within
to
fire
on
an
attacking
party
,
with
but
little
danger
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
main
,
in
fact
the
only
entrance
to
the
house
,
was
by
the
door
already
mentioned
,
which
opened
into
a
hall
running
through
the
centre
of
the
building
,
on
either
side
of
which
was
a
door
,
opening
in
turn
into
other
apartments
.
<EOS>
To
the
right
of
the
entrance
was
a
room
of
good
dimensions
,
comfortably
furnished
,
containing
an
old
fashioned
fire
-
place
,
where
the
meals
were
cooked
and
served
,
and
where
the
family
generally
assembled
.
<EOS>
From
this
apartment
was
a
stair
-
case
leading
to
a
floor
above
,
which
ran
along
under
the
roof
,
forming
a
place
of
deposit
for
old
rubbish
,
and
which
,
if
necessary
,
could
be
used
as
a
sleeping
room
.
<EOS>
The
cottage
was
well
furnished
throughout
,
better
than
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
in
this
part
of
the
country
—
Webber
having
brought
much
of
the
furniture
with
him
from
the
East
.
<EOS>
In
the
apartment
to
the
right
,
just
spoken
of
,
on
the
evening
of
the
day
which
opens
our
tale
,
were
assembled
Webber
,
his
wife
and
younger
son
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
the
floor
stood
a
table
,
covered
with
a
clean
white
cloth
,
on
which
were
ranged
various
dishes
,
some
evidently
used
,
while
others
remained
untouched
in
their
places
,
indicating
that
a
part
of
the
family
,
and
a
part
only
,
had
partaken
of
the
evening
's
repast
.
<EOS>
A
candle
placed
on
the
table
,
served
to
light
the
apartment
and
exhibit
the
features
of
the
occupants
,
all
of
whom
seemed
to
wear
an
air
of
gloomy
apprehension
.
<EOS>
—
The
doors
and
windows
being
thrown
open
,
admitted
the
breeze
,
which
came
with
a
cool
and
invigorating
effect
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
the
silence
remained
unbroken
,
while
Webber
arose
from
his
seat
,
and
paced
with
anxious
strides
the
floor
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
"I
wonder
they
do
not
arrive
!
"
<EOS>
at
length
he
exclaimed
;
"
they
surely
have
had
time
enough
since
the
shower
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
spoke
he
strode
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
moon
had
sufficiently
risen
to
throw
light
upon
a
scene
,
where
the
work
of
devastation
had
been
carried
on
to
a
remarkable
degree
.
<EOS>
As
Webber
gazed
around
him
,
he
beheld
in
every
direction
tall
,
lofty
trees
torn
from
their
foundations
—
<EOS>
limbs
torn
from
the
trunks
of
others
—
fences
leveled
to
the
ground
,
and
the
crops
,
the
toil
of
a
season
,
beat
to
the
earth
as
though
trampled
by
a
caravan
.
<EOS>
But
with
this
it
was
evident
<EOS>
his
mind
was
but
little
occupied
;
for
after
casting
a
hasty
glance
over
the
scene
,
he
turned
in
another
direction
,
and
his
eye
followed
the
road
,
<EOS>
which
at
some
little
distance
to
the
east
wound
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
.
<EOS>
Here
he
gazed
intently
for
a
few
moments
,
while
the
gloom
which
had
been
settling
over
his
features
,
gradually
deepened
.
<EOS>
As
he
stood
gazing
thus
,
a
sigh
,
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
heart
,
caused
him
to
turn
his
head
,
when
he
beheld
Rufus
—
who
had
noiselessly
followed
him
to
the
door
—
with
his
eyes
fixed
in
the
same
direction
,
his
features
pale
,
almost
ghastly
—
while
the
workings
of
his
countenance
,
and
the
quivering
of
his
lips
,
denoted
a
strange
nervous
excitability
.
<EOS>
"Rufus
!
<EOS>
Rufus
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Webber
,
taking
hold
of
his
arm
;
"
what
means
this
,
my
son?—why
are
you
so
agitated?"The
young
man
started
,
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
looked
hurriedly
around
,
as
one
suddenly
awakened
from
a
dream
;
and
then
,
while
a
slight
flush
tinged
his
handsome
features
,
quietly
withdrew
without
deigning
a
reply
.
<EOS>
At
another
time
such
singularity
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
his
son
,
would
have
attracted
the
attention
of
Webber
to
know
the
cause
;
but
under
the
present
circumstances
,
his
own
mind
was
too
much
occupied
to
give
it
heed
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
longer
,
he
stood
,
his
eyes
fixed
in
the
direction
mentioned
,
and
then
,
as
if
sadly
disappointed
,
with
slow
and
musing
pace
returned
to
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
"Strange
!
"
said
he
,
"
that
they
do
not
return
.
<EOS>
I
fear
they
have
met
with
some
serious
accident
;
for
this
storm
has
been
most
alarming
in
its
consequences
.
<EOS>
""Had
we
not
better
go
in
search
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Rufus
,
his
voice
trembling
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
"True
,
my
son
,
we
must
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Webber
,
with
decision
.
<EOS>
"
Can
the
horses
be
found
conveniently?""I
observed
two
,
but
a
few
paces
distant
,
"
rejoined
Rufus
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
will
not
both
leave
?
"
said
Mrs.
Webber
,
enquiringly
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
no
,
"
answered
Webber
,
thoughtfully
;
"
one
I
think
will
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
will
go
,
"
said
Rufus
,
with
energy
.
"Why
<EOS>
so
,
my
son?""Ask
me
not
,
father
;
I
have
reasons
,
"
replied
he
,
confusedly
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
be
it
so
;
but
be
speedy
.
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
started
,
for
he
fancied
he
heard
voices
in
conversation
;
and
moving
quickly
to
the
door
,
both
father
and
son
listened
attentively
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
they
come
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Webber
,
as
some
figures
were
descried
descending
the
hill
.
<EOS>
"She
is
not
there
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rufus
,
quickly
.
"How
<EOS>
know
you
that
?
<EOS>
"
enquired
Webber
!
"
<EOS>
With
my
eyes
I
can
not
distinguish
individuals
at
that
distance
.
<EOS>
How
know
you
Emily
is
not
there
,
Rufus?"But
Rufus
was
gone
;
and
his
father
discerned
his
figure
,
at
some
little
distance
,
gliding
swiftly
on
in
the
direction
of
the
horses
.
<EOS>
A
moment
or
two
later
,
he
heard
the
clattering
of
hoofs
,
and
his
son
rode
quickly
past
.
<EOS>
He
called
to
him
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
heard
not
,
heeded
not
,
but
urged
his
horse
to
his
utmost
speed
.
"Why
<EOS>
the
youth
is
insane
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Webber
,
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
he
stops!—he
has
met
them
returning
.
<EOS>
But
no
!
<EOS>
on
he
goes
again
!
<EOS>
—
now
he
dashes
over
the
hill!—surely
,
something
has
happened
,
or
he
would
have
returned
;
"
and
with
an
agitated
step
,
he
moved
on
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
The
voices
of
the
approaching
party
were
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
growing
louder
as
they
neared
him
,
and
Webber
was
soon
enabled
to
hear
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
He
paused
to
listen
,
for
he
fancied
he
heard
a
voice
with
which
he
was
not
unfamiliar
.
"Now
<EOS>
jest
keep
right
on
,
Mr.
Jack
;
you
haint
got
a
great
ways
furder
to
go
,
no
how
;
and
I
kind
o
<EOS>
'
guess
you
'll
git
rested
by
the
time
you
'll
be
wanted
to
travel
agin
.
<EOS>
Now
ye
need
n't
look
so
tarnal
cross
about
it;—I
do
n't
much
like
the
idea
<EOS>
o
'
bragging
over
a
chap
that
's
hampered
,
but
I
'll
jest
tell
ye
<EOS>
what
'
tis
,
Mr.
Jack
Curdish
,
I
jest
think
I
could
lick
you
in
a
fair
rough
and
tumble
fight
in
about
two
minutes
;
I
do
,
<EOS>
I
swow!""Hush
!
"
said
another
voice
.
<EOS>
"
Be
not
too
over
-
bearing
—
remember
the
man
is
your
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""Wal
<EOS>
so
I
do
,
Mark
;
but
the
feller
wo
n't
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
stuffey
as
a
mule
,
and
I
's
jest
trying
to
see
if
I
could'nt
brag
something
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
him
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
Harvey
Bernard
!
"
cried
Webber
,
springing
forward
,
as
he
fully
recognised
the
speaker
,
and
grasping
his
hand,—"welcome
,
most
welcome
,
friend
Harvey
.
<EOS>
""Jest
<EOS>
the
same
old
Webber
yit
,
"
returned
Bernard
,
giving
his
hand
a
hearty
shake
.
<EOS>
"
Why
you
look
jest
as
naternal
as
life
.
<EOS>
This
ere
's
Marcus
Tyrone
,
a
friend
o
'
mine
.
<EOS>
""Welcome
,
Tyrone
,
"
said
Webber
,
cordially
extending
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"This
other
chap
's
name
's
Jack
Curdish
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
shake
hands
with
him
;
for
he
's
jest
as
big
a
rascal
as
ever
run
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
what
mean
you
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Webber
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Tell
<EOS>
him
,
Mark
;
you
can
git
at
it
<EOS>
a
great
deal
quicker
than
I
can
.
<EOS>
"Tyrone
accordingly
explained
,
in
as
few
words
as
possible
,
how
matters
stood
.
<EOS>
"Gods
!
"
exclaimed
Webber
,
as
he
heard
of
Emily
's
capture
,
his
features
working
with
the
most
powerful
emotion
;
and
for
a
moment
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
,
while
his
whole
frame
shook
convulsively
.
<EOS>
Again
resuming
his
outward
calmness
,
he
walked
close
to
the
side
of
Curdish
,
who
glanced
uneasily
about
him
,
and
in
a
voice
of
suppressed
passion
,
between
his
clenched
teeth
,
said
:
"
Curdish
,
by
the
living
God
above
us
!
<EOS>
if
that
girl
come
to
harm
,
I
will
make
such
an
example
of
you
,
that
it
shall
find
a
place
on
history
's
page
for
its
atrocity
!
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
where
is
the
girl
?
<EOS>
and
if
I
succeed
in
finding
her
,
unharmed
,
it
shall
go
much
better
with
you
.
<EOS>
""I'll
<EOS>
tell
you
nothing
to
-
night
,
"
growled
Curdish
;
<EOS>
who
fearful
of
consequences
,
if
they
went
in
pursuit
,
thought
he
would
gain
time
by
delaying
the
search
.
"Why
<EOS>
not
to
-
night?""'Cause
<EOS>
I
won't
<EOS>
—
that
's
why!—hang
<EOS>
me
,
if
I
'm
goin'
to
give
ye
any
more
explanations
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
your
blood
be
on
your
own
head
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Webber
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
the
house
with
him
,
as
fast
as
possible
!
<EOS>
I
will
hurry
forward
and
prepare
a
place
for
his
reception
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
a
few
minutes
Curdish
was
placed
in
the
room
on
the
left
of
the
hall
,
the
door
and
windows
made
fast
,
and
there
left
to
pass
the
remainder
of
the
night
,
in
communion
with
his
own
dark
thoughts
.
<EOS>
And
dark
and
dreadful
are
the
thoughts
of
the
guilty!—for
<EOS>
their
conscience
is
a
hell
,
from
which
there
is
no
escape
.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
consultation
,
Webber
and
his
friends
concluded
it
were
better
to
wait
till
morning
,
ere
they
set
out
in
search
of
Emily
;
the
more
so
,
as
both
Edward
and
Rufus
had
already
gone
in
pursuit
,
and
perchance
,
by
awaiting
,
tidings
might
be
gained
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
little
was
said
,
for
all
felt
a
heaviness
of
heart
;
and
wearied
by
traveling
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
partook
of
the
food
set
before
them
,
in
gloomy
silence
.
<EOS>
"This
is
a
sad
meeting
!
"
<EOS>
began
Webber
,
after
a
long
pause
,
in
a
voice
so
changed
that
both
Bernard
and
Tyrone
involuntarily
started
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
sad
meeting
!
<EOS>
If
this
girl
comes
to
harm
,
I
fear
my
reason
will
desert
me
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
William
!
"
cried
his
wife
;
"
are
your
thoughts
more
bound
up
in
the
child
of
a
stranger
,
than
in
your
own
flesh
and
<EOS>
blood?""Yes
,
Sarah
,
I
confess
it
is
even
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
struggled
hard
against
it
—
I
have
sought
to
share
my
affection
alike
with
each
member
of
my
family
;
but
why
,
I
know
not
—
perhaps
by
her
angel
disposition
—
the
gentle
forsaken
has
been
the
idol
of
my
secret
thoughts
.
<EOS>
But
enough
of
this
,
Sarah
;
the
subject
is
painful
to
me
;
"
and
he
pressed
his
hands
against
his
heated
temples
,
as
though
to
still
their
throbbing
.
<EOS>
"What
course
do
you
intend
to
pursue
with
your
prisoner
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Tyrone
,
anxious
to
draw
his
thoughts
into
another
channel
.
"Death
!
"
exclaimed
Webber
,
quickly
and
fiercely
,
while
his
teeth
clenched
,
and
his
brow
contracted
into
a
frown
of
unshaken
resolve
.
"Death
!
<EOS>
"
cried
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
death
!
<EOS>
there
must
be
an
example
made
!
"
said
Webber
,
in
a
deep
,
stern
tone
.
"William
!
<EOS>
"
cried
his
wife
,
rushing
to
him
:
—
"
You
are
not
yourself,—do
not
talk
thus!""Sarah
,
"
returned
Webber
,
gently
pushing
her
from
him
,
while
the
frown
grew
darker
on
his
brow
,
"
seek
not
to
alter
it
;
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
""But
why
not
appeal
to
the
law
for
redress
?
"
asked
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
overlook
,
Tyrone
,
that
our
laws
here
are
almost
ineffective
,
and
force
us
,
in
a
measure
,
to
make
our
own
.
<EOS>
""True
!
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
""Now
<EOS>
,
Bill
Webber
,
I
'll
jest
tell
you
what
'
tis
,
"
began
Bernard
:
"
<EOS>
I
know
my
opinion
ai
nt
o
'
no
great
account
,
<EOS>
any
how
;
<EOS>
but
I
've
known
you
ever
since
I
was
a
leetle
boy
,
and
<EOS>
somehow
I
kind
o
'
feel
I
have
a
right
to
say
something
;
and
I
'm
jest
agoing
to
say
,
<EOS>
if
you
could
manage
to
punish
this
ere
infernal
scoundrel
some
way
,
without
taking
his
life
,
you
'll
feel
a
great
deal
better
when
you
come
to
die
yourself

<EOS>
I
haint
the
least
doubt
but
the
feller
oughter
die
,
to
get
his
deserts
;
but
ye
see
,
the
Almighty
made
him
,
and
has
kept
him
alive
,
so
far
,
and
will
undoubtedly
punish
him
,
some
day
or
other
;
and
now
the
question
is
,
whether
you
had
n't
better
let
the
Almighty
take
his
own
way
about
it
,
instead
of
taking
all
o
'
the
responsibility
yourself?""I
know
your
honest
heart
,
Bernard
,
"
said
Webber
,
approaching
and
grasping
his
hand
;
"
I
know
in
all
you
say
,
you
aim
for
my
own
good
;
but
in
this
I
am
resolved
,
and
must
have
my
own
way
,
therefore
seek
not
to
alter
me
.
<EOS>
""Wal
,
if
your
mind
's
made
up
,
"
rejoined
Bernard
,
"
I
ai
nt
the
chap
to
say
anything
furder
;
only
if
you
want
any
help
,
Harvey
Bernard
's
right
here
,
and
he
haint
never
been
known
to
refuse
a
friend
assistance
<EOS>
yit
.
<EOS>
I
jest
spoke
,
'cause
I
kind

considered
it
a
duty
to
do
it

bein

as
how
I
've
eased
my

I
haint
nothing
furder

<EOS>
"Just
at
this
instant
was
heard
the
clatter
of
a
horse
's
hoofs
,
and
all
sprang
eagerly
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
news
,
my
son
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Webber
,
as
Rufus
,
pale
and
breathless
,
leaped
from
his
panting
steed
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
—
they
are
safe
and
coming
!
"
<EOS>
replied
he
,
almost
wildly
.
<EOS>
"Thank
<EOS>
God
,
and
you
!
"
exclaimed
Webber
,
clasping
him
in
his
arms
,
as
though
he
were
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
relieved
my
brain
of
a
weight
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
the
matter
,
my
son
?
"
—
added
he
in
alarm
,
as
he
became
aware
of
an
increasing
languor
on
the
part
of
Rufus
.
<EOS>
"Father
,
I
am
ill
!
"
<EOS>
sighed
Rufus
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"You
are
indeed
,
my
son
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
bore
him
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Cordials
,
such
as
they
had
,
were
administered
,
but
to
no
effect
.
<EOS>
He
grew
wild
,
delirious
,
and
was
finally
placed
in
bed
,
in
a
high
state
of
fever
.
<EOS>
His
mother
,
whose
whole
soul
seemed
bound
up
in
him
,
paced
the
room
,
wringing
her
hands
in
an
agony
of
grief
,
and
crying
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
my
God
!
<EOS>
spare
me
<EOS>
this!"There
are
some
people
so
constituted
by
nature
,
that
they
possess
no
feelings
in
common
with
the
rest
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
With
those
around
them
they
have
no
kindred
ties
,
no
sympathetic
chord
that
vibrates
at
the
slightest
touch
,
linking
soul
with
soul
in
the
holy
bond
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
They
live
in
,
yet
separate
as
it
were
,
from
the
world
;
and
are
thought
by
the
rest
of
mankind
to
be
cold
,
unsocial
,
unfeeling
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
in
a
great
measure
they
are
so
;
yet
notwithstanding
,
they
have
their
objects
of
affection
,
for
the
heart
must
cling
to
something
,
and
in
proportion
as
they
isolate
themselves
from
the
many
,
<EOS>
so
does
their
soul
embrace
the
few
,
or
the
one
,
with
a
violence
of
passion
others
<EOS>
deem
not
they
possess
.
<EOS>
Such
was
,
in
part
,
the
case
with
Mrs.
Webber
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
she
liked
her
husband
,
she
liked
her
family
,
her
friends
,
but
Rufus
was
the
idol
,
the
only
idol
of
her
soul
.
<EOS>
In
him
were
her
hopes
,
fears
and
joys
centered
.
<EOS>
A
woman
that
said
very
little
,
she
was
not
one
to
make
an
outward
show
of
affection
,
by
a
thousand
little
demonstrations
that
count
so
much
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
and
a
stranger
might
have
thought
she
felt
alike
toward
all
.
<EOS>
She
would
steal
away
unseen
,
and
hour
by
hour
watch
,
concentrating
her
very
soul
on
him
,
with
all
the
deep
,
holy
devotion
of
a
mother
's
love
.
<EOS>
And
well
was
he
worthy
—
for
within
his
breast
beat
a
pure
,
a
high
-
minded
,
noble
heart
.
<EOS>
What
then
were
her
feelings
when
she
saw
him
stretched
on
a
bed
of
sickness
—
pain
—
with
reason
,
the
immortal
endowment
of
God
,
tottering
upon
its
throne
?
<EOS>
Who
shall
tell
—
who
describe
a
mother
's
anguish
in
a
scene
like
this
?
<EOS>
when
she
beholds
the
beloved
of
her
soul
in
the
jaws
of
earth
's
mightiest
foe
,
Death
!
<EOS>
Words
fail
,
the
pen
droops
,
and
we
veil
the
feelings
from
the
eyes
of
all
but
imagination
.
<EOS>
An
hour
or
two
later
Merton
and
Emily
arrived
.
<EOS>
They
were
warmly
greeted
,
but
there
was
no
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
Over
all
hung
the
cold
icy
gloom
which
pervades
the
house
of
mourning
.
<EOS>
—
Words
were
said
in
whispers
,
and
each
glided
stealthily
about
,
with
that
mysterious
air
which
reminds
one
of
the
fabled
spectres
of
tradition
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Emily
,
like
a
ministering
spirit
,
immediately
took
her
place
at
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
She
felt
grieved
to
the
heart
,
for
she
loved
him
with
a
sister
's
love
.
<EOS>
Both
herself
and
Merton
were
surprised
to
learn
he
had
been
in
pursuit
of
them
.
<EOS>
—
They
had
never
seen
him
.
<EOS>
Once
they
had
fancied
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
somewhat
distant
,
but
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
This
annunciation
surprised
all
,
for
it
was
evident
that
he
had
seen
them
,
as
he
had
told
of
their
coming
.
<EOS>
Webber
mused
on
the
singular
conduct
of
Rufus
,
prior
to
his
departure
,
which
now
struck
him
with
force
,
shook
his
head
gravely
,
but
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Merton
had
partaken
of
some
refreshment
,
he
mounted
another
horse
and
rode
swiftly
to
St.
Louis
for
a
physician
,
who
arrived
toward
night
of
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
He
felt
of
the
sufferer
's
pulse
—
looked
grave
—
felt
of
his
pulse
again
—
shook
his
head
,
and
pronounced
it
a
severe
case
of
intermittent
fever
.
<EOS>
On
opening
the
door
of
the
apartment
where
Curdish
had
been
confined
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
it
was
found
empty
,
which
was
the
more
unaccountable
,
as
everything
was
fast
just
as
it
had
been
left
the
evening
before
.
<EOS>
Webber
was
both
vexed
and
perplexed
that
the
villain
had
thus
escaped
;
but
after
reasoning
awhile
with
himself
,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
under
the
present
circumstances
it
was
all
for
the
best
;
and
his
thoughts
of
vengeance
gradually
emerged
into
fears
for
the
life
of
his
youngest
born
.
<EOS>
We
must
now
leave
all
for
the
present
,
and
turn
to
another
scene
.

PART

<EOS>
I.THE
GRAND
RENDEZVOUS
OF
THE
BANDITTI
—
THE
BANDIT
CHIEF
AND
HIS
WIFE
—
THE
SONG
—
<EOS>
THE
TALE.On
<EOS>
the
banks
of
the
Osage
,
some
several
miles
from
where
it
empties
into
the
dark
and
muddy
Missouri
,
is
a
wild
,
gloomy
and
romantic
spot
.
<EOS>
—
Even
at
the
present
day
it
has
not
been
reached
by
civilization
,
and
still
stands
alone
in
the
solemn
grandeur
of
nature
.
<EOS>
Here
mountains
rear
their
rugged
heads
steep
and
stupendous
;
there
fearful
chasms
yawn
as
if
awaiting
some
prey
for
their
mighty
jaws
;
while
anon
dashes
along
some
sparkling
rivulet
,
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
,
making
music
in
its
devious
course
,
until
finally
plunging
into
some
larger
stream
,
its
tiny
youthful
song
is
forever
buried
in
oblivion
.
<EOS>
From
the
Osage
,
back
for
some
little
distance
,
flows
a
creek
—
reflecting
its
rugged
banks
in
its
silvery
bosom
as
in
a
mirror
—
and
terminates
in
a
semi
,
or
three
-
quarter
circled
cove
,
surrounded
by
tall
,
majestic
,
overhanging
cliffs
.
<EOS>
This
water
is
supplied
from
the
Osage
,
and
passing
as
it
does
between
such
craggy
steeps
,
forms
a
dark
,
lonely
,
silent
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
rocks
surrounding
its
termination
are
high
and
arching
,
so
that
their
base
can
only
be
approached
by
water
.
<EOS>
Within
this
cove
,
beneath
these
rocks
,
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
was
an
extensive
cavern
—
known
at
the
present
day
by
the
name
of
"
The
Robber
's
Cave
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
well
calculated
as
a
fugitive
retreat
;
for
defended
by
a
few
,
it
would
be
a
risky
attack
for
a
combined
force
,
even
though
possessed
of
overwhelming
numbers
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
approached
only
by
boats
coming
from
the
Osage
,
as
the
sides
of
the
creek
were
lined
with
precipitous
rocks
,
where
descent
would
be
at
the
imminent
peril
of
the
hardy
adventurer
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
fact
,
a
spot
which
seemed
as
it
were
planned
and
fortified
by
Nature
,
in
one
of
her
wildest
moods
,
for
some
great
and
daring
enterprise
.
<EOS>
Standing
on
the
summit
of
one
of
the
surrounding
cliffs
,
the
eye
embraced
an
extensive
scope
of
country
,
whose
ragged
,
picturesque
surface
presented
scenes
sublimely
beautiful
,
and
as
variegated
as
the
wildest
conceptions
of
the
most
vivid
imagination
.
<EOS>
Here
you
beheld
a
stunted
growth
of
trees
overhanging
some
frightful
precipice
;
there
rocks
piled
topling
up
,
until
they
seemed
ready
to
fall
with
a
crashing
vengeance
upon
minor
objects
below
;
while
winding
like
a
silvery
belt
between
,
at
some
little
distance
,
was
the
dark
and
silent
Osage
,
gliding
on
to
be
united
with
one
of
earth
's
mightiest
rivers
,
and
then
forever
lost
in
its
last
long
home
of
the
boundless
deep
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
in
contemplating
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
Nature
,
something
so
fascinating
,
so
holy
,
so
inspiring
—
we
feel
so
drawn
away
from
the
many
petty
trifles
of
common
life
,
that
to
die
amid
such
scenes
appears
to
us
as
it
were
robbing
Death
of
half
his
terrors
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
then
we
feel
purified
—
elevated
;
we
feel
that
we
are
alone
in
the
presence
of
God
—
Almighty
God
!
<EOS>
and
when
it
shall
be
our
fate
,
as
sooner
or
later
it
must
be
,
(
and
with
all
)
to
pass
the
bourne
whence
none
return
,
O
!
<EOS>
let
our
body
be
consigned
to
dust
beside
the
dashing
of
some
stream
,
away
from
the
haunts
of
men
,
where
the
soul
,
the
sublime
soul
of
Nature
herself
pervades!The
cavern
of
which
we
have
made
mention
,
and
to
which
we
must
now
turn
our
attention
,
was
entered
from
the
creek
,
through
a
small
aperture
some
two
feet
above
the
water
.
<EOS>
From
this
you
descended
rather
abruptly
some
ten
or
fifteen
feet
,
when
you
found
yourself
in
a
large
,
arching
cave
of
stone
,
sufficient
in
size
to
contain
an
hundred
and
fifty
persons
.
<EOS>
From
this
was
a
low
arched
passage
through
the
rock
,
leading
into
another
apartment
,
some
twenty
by
thirty
feet
.
<EOS>
This
secret
retreat
,
at
the
date
of
our
story
,
was
the
grand
rendezvous
of
a
numerous
banditti
,
of
whom
mention
has
been
made
in
the
opening
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Along
the
sides
of
the
cave
were
ranged
pistols
,
knives
,
rifles
,
carbines
,
powder
-
flasks
,
and
all
the
various
insignia
of
warfare
.
<EOS>
At
one
end
was
erected
a
platform
,
whereon
the
chief
of
the
banditti
sat
or
stood
,
when
holding
public
council
.
<EOS>
Along
the
sides
were
ranged
oaken
benches
,
where
the
members
could
be
seated
,
and
the
whole
together
wore
an
air
of
comfort
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
But
of
the
Inner
Cave
,
or
Chieftain
's
Chamber
,
as
it
was
generally
called
,
we
wish
for
the
present
to
speak
more
particularly
.
<EOS>
Could
one
have
been
introduced
into
it
privately
,
or
without
knowing
where
he
was
,
and
seen
it
lighted
in
all
its
brilliancy
,
he
would
have
fancied
himself
in
the
gorgeous
apartment
of
some
palace
,
rather
than
in
a
robber
's
cave
.
<EOS>
Everything
in
the
shape
of
splendor
and
luxury
was
there
.
<EOS>
A
rich
damask
silk
curtain
,
arranged
in
graceful
folds
,
extended
round
and
completely
screened
the
walls
;
against
which
,
from
floor
to
ceiling
,
extended
four
splendid
mirrors
,
in
gilt
frames
,
each
placed
opposite
the
other
,
occupying
the
four
sides
of
the
apartment
and
reflecting
every
object
in
it
.
<EOS>
Much
of
the
intervening
space
on
the
walls
was
filled
with
paintings
of
various
and
fanciful
designs
,
but
all
evidently
executed
by
artists
of
no
ordinary
talent:—in
fact
,
some
of
them
were
from
the
great
masters
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
On
the
floor
,
which
was
dark
,
of
marble
polish
,
stood
several
sofas
,
of
elegant
workmanship
,
together
with
a
table
of
solid
stone
,
most
beautifully
carved
,
on
which
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
were
piled
books
and
music
.
<EOS>
A
guitar
and
violin
,
evidently
in
much
requisition
,
were
lying
carelessly
on
one
of
the
sofas
,
beside
which
,
in
seeming
contrast
,
lay
a
brace
of
pistols
,
a
gold
mounted
short
sword
and
a
silver
handled
dirk
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
In
fact
,
several
of
the
last
mentioned
articles
were
occupying
positions
in
different
parts
of
the
Chamber
,
strangely
at
variance
with
its
otherwise
poetical
aspect
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
outlet
to
this
apartment
,
save
the
aperture
already
mentioned
as
connecting
it
with
the
larger
cave
,
and
consequently
the
light
,
which
must
of
necessity
be
artificial
,
proceeded
from
a
gold
mounted
chandelier
,
suspended
midway
of
the
ceiling
,
and
gave
to
each
thing
a
soft
,
dreamy
,
voluptuous
appearance
.
<EOS>
We
have
said
there
was
no
outlet
,
save
one
;
but
in
addition
to
what
the
reader
has
already
seen
,
was
a
recess
,
entered
by
drawing
aside
the
folds
of
the
curtain
,
sufficiently
large
for
a
sleeping
apartment
,
and
was
doubtless
used
for
this
purpose
,
as
it
contained
the
requisites
.
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
appear
strange
to
the
reader
,
that
so
much
of
luxury
,
civilization
,
and
even
refinement
,
should
be
found
at
this
period
,
so
far
back
in
the
wilds
of
Missouri
,
and
what
is
more
,
in
a
robber
's
cave
.
<EOS>
But
to
the
very
circumstance
of
its
being
a
robber
's
cave
,
let
it
be
attributed
;
for
the
access
that
an
organized
banditti
would
have
to
various
kinds
of
plunder
,
may
be
said
to
be
almost
limitless
.
<EOS>
That
such
things
as
we
have
mentioned
could
have
been
procured
and
brought
hither
,
no
one
will
question
—
that
they
were
,
we
assert
.
<EOS>
There
is
also
another
thing
to
be
taken
into
consideration
.
<EOS>
That
the
chief
of
these
outlaws
was
no
ordinary
individual
,
that
he
was
a
man
of
some
learning
,
taste
and
refinement
—
of
a
fanciful
,
poetical
temperament
—
<EOS>
the
selection
and
arrangement
of
the
articles
in
his
private
apartment
go
to
prove
.
<EOS>
But
this
will
doubtless
be
developed
in
the
progress
of
our
story
,
therefore
we
will
not
anticipate
,
but
turn
our
attention
to
the
present
occupants
of
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
.
<EOS>
On
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
with
which
we
closed
the
preceding
chapter
,
reclining
in
an
easy
,
graceful
attitude
on
one
of
the
sofas
of
this
elegant
apartment
,
was
a
beautiful
female
of
some
twenty
summers
.
<EOS>
To
give
anything
like
a
perfect
description
of
her
dress
and
appearance
,
will
,
we
fear
,
be
an
impossibility
;
yet
we
may
be
able
to
draw
a
sketch
,
from
which
the
imagination
of
the
reader
may
fill
the
picture
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
cast
in
nature
's
finest
mould
,
and
though
not
strictly
classic
,
yet
possessing
an
appearance
of
delicate
chiseling
,
if
we
may
so
express
it
,
which
is
never
seen
save
in
those
whose
mental
power
predominates
over
their
physical
—
or
,
in
other
words
,
whose
intellectual
commands
our
respect
,
where
otherwise
the
animal
would
excite
our
passions
.
<EOS>
Her
skin
was
dark
and
spoke
her
Spanish
origin
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
black
,
and
fell
in
a
sort
of
graceful
negligence
around
a
beautiful
rounded
neck
,
which
was
bared
low
,
and
gave
her
a
somewhat
voluptuous
appearance
;
nor
was
this
lessened
by
her
round
,
plump
,
soft
arms
—
bare
nearly
to
her
shoulders
—
one
of
which
was
thrown
gracefully
under
her
head
,
and
ended
in
a
small
pretty
hand
,
with
gently
tapering
fingers,—the
latter
,
by
the
way
,
glittering
with
rings
of
great
value
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
black
—
sparkling
black
—
in
whose
liquid
depths
you
could
see
the
fire
of
passion
,
the
jealousy
of
love
and
the
revenge
of
hate
.
<EOS>
Love
was
there
—
wild
passionate
love
—
but
it
was
love
that
must
know
no
rival
,
else
the
fawn
would
be
changed
to
the
tigress
.
<EOS>
It
was
love
that
would
dare
all
,
sacrifice
all
,
for
the
object
on
which
it
was
fixed
;
but
that
object
must
love
in
return
,
or
be
itself
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
There
was
about
her
mouth
a
peculiar
expression
,
which
we
can
not
forbear
to
notice
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
smile
,
but
then
it
was
a
smile
<EOS>
wherein
you
could
read
to
a
certain
extent
the
mind
which
governed
it
.
<EOS>
Was
she
sad
,
it
was
mournful
;
was
she
happy
,
it
was
pleasing
;
was
she
angry
,
it
was
full
of
scorn
,
defiance
and
revenge
;
but
in
all
moods
,
all
changes
of
feeling
,
it
was
ever
there
,
it
was
ever
a
smile
Her
dress
was
cut
low
around
the
neck
,
leaving
the
arms
also
bare
,
and
was
fancifully
trimmed
with
gold
lace
,
which
gave
it
a
very
singular
effect
.
<EOS>
The
other
occupant
of
the
Chamber
was
a
female
slave
—
a
mulatto
—
who
was
standing
before
one
of
the
mirrors
,
arranging
her
curly
hair
with
great
precision
,
and
viewing
her
comely
features
with
no
small
degree
of
pride
.
<EOS>
She
was
of
good
proportions
,
some
twenty
-
five
years
of
age
,
possessed
a
rather
pleasing
countenance
,
and
,
for
one
of
her
race
,
of
more
than
ordinary
intellect
.
<EOS>
She
was
gaily
and
somewhat
fantastically
dressed
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
the
lady
on
the
sofa
gazed
upon
her
slave
in
that
languid
manner
which
bespeaks
the
mind
occupied
in
some
pleasing
reverie
,
and
then
slightly
raising
herself
and
altering
her
position
,
in
a
voice
peculiar
for
its
musical
tones
,
said:"Cyntha
<EOS>
,
do
you
hear
the
dip
of
oars?"The
other
listened
a
moment
,
and
then
made
answer
:
"
<EOS>
No
,
missus
.
<EOS>
""I
think
your
ears
are
<EOS>
a
little
dull
,
Cyntha
.
—
Question
<EOS>
the
sentinel!"The
other
instantly
disappeared
into
the
larger
cave
and
quickly
returned
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
yes
,
missus
right
,
massa
coming
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
I
thought
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
with
a
pleasing
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Cyntha
,
the
ears
of
love
are
quick
.
<EOS>
""O
yesum
,
missus
<EOS>
,
I
knows
'em
berry
quick
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
now
,
arrange
my
hair
,
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
slave
sprang
to
her
mistress
,
with
the
agility
of
one
accustomed
to
obey
with
promptness
the
slightest
command
of
her
superiors
,
and
in
a
few
moments
all
was
arranged
in
tasteful
order
.
<EOS>
—
Scarcely
was
it
completed
,
when
a
heavy
tread
was
heard
in
the
Outer
Cave
,
and
the
next
moment
a
figure
of
commanding
appearance
stood
full
in
the
light
of
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
.
<EOS>
The
lady
arose
,
flew
to
his
arms
,
and
the
lips
of
both
met
:
<EOS>
then
leading
her
to
a
sofa
,
he
seated
himself
beside
her
,
removing
at
the
same
time
from
his
head
a
cap
of
very
singular
construction
,
and
exhibiting
a
forehead
broad
and
high
,
surmounted
by
glossy
raven
hair
,
which
fell
in
ringlets
adown
his
face
and
around
a
neck
,
whose
full
,
handsome
proportions
were
indicitive
of
great
muscular
power
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
dark
,
darker
even
than
the
lady
's
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
black
and
brilliant
—
<EOS>
his
features
bold
,
though
in
outline
rather
handsome
,
and
his
chin
was
graced
with
an
imperial
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
of
a
strange
order
,
and
seemed
to
combine
the
sailor
and
the
back
-
woodsman
—
in
fact
he
was
a
man
that
the
most
casual
observer
would
not
have
passed
without
a
second
notice
.
<EOS>
—
Turning
to
the
lady
with
a
look
of
tender
admiration
,
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
waist
,
drew
her
fondly
to
him
,
and
again
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
,
saying
at
the
same
time
,
in
a
low
tone:"My
Inez
looks
beautiful
to
-
day!""And
<EOS>
Inez
is
proud
that
Ronald
thinks
so
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
with
a
smile
of
sweetness
,
her
eyes
beaming
with
love
,
and
fixed
earnestly
upon
his
.
"
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
Ronald
,
why
have
you
been
thus
long
away
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
wearily
the
hours
have
passed
,
and
methought
last
night
would
never
bring
a
morn
.
<EOS>
""Business
<EOS>
,
Inez
,
business
prolonged
my
absence
,
"
answered
the
other
somewhat
hurriedly
.
"
<EOS>
But
come
,
"
he
added
,
as
though
to
change
the
theme
,
"
let
us
have
some
music
!
<EOS>
I
am
sighing
for
a
tender
strain
,
to
drown
a
world
of
thought!""Thought
,
Ronald
,
thought
!
<EOS>
what
makes
you
think
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Inez
,
gazing
into
his
face
with
a
look
of
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
,
love
,
nothing
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
Cyntha
—
the
music
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
the
slave
brought
forward
the
guitar
,
he
continued:—"There
Inez
,
my
pretty
one
,
come
,
music
,
music!—a
song
,
love
,
a
song!"Inez
<EOS>
took
the
guitar
,
still
eyeing
him
steadily
,
as
though
there
was
something
in
his
humor
unnatural
and
which
she
could
not
comprehend
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
not
accompany
me
,
Ronald?""No
,
<EOS>
Inez
,
I
will
listen
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
shall
I
play
and
sing?""Anything
!
<EOS>
something
wild!""Wild
,
Ronald?""Wild
and
sweet
,
Inez
.
<EOS>
""Ronald
,
you
are
not
yourself
;
"
and
Inez
ran
her
fingers
over
the
strings
,
paused
and
gazed
tenderly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
Something
troubles
you
,
Ronald
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
tell
your
Inez
the
secret
;
"
and
the
smile
was
mournful
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
swear
to
you
<EOS>
it
is
nothing
—
I
am
cheerful
;
"
and
he
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
song
!
<EOS>
the
song!""Shall
it
be
The
Rover?""Ay
!
<EOS>
The
Rover
.
<EOS>
"Inez
made
no
further
remark
,
but
tuning
her
instrument
,
in
a
voice
rich
in
melody
<EOS>
sangTHE
<EOS>
ROVER.Thoughtful
<EOS>
he
stoodOn
<EOS>
the
mountain
's
high
brow
—
Sadly
he
gazedOn
<EOS>
the
valley
below;For
there
,
'
mid
a
grove
,
by
a
silvery
stream
,
Was
the
spot
of
his
childhood
,
his
youth
's
happy
dream
.
<EOS>
Sadly
he
musedAs
<EOS>
his
look
wandered
o'erChildhood
's
bright
scenes
,
That
must
know
him
<EOS>
no
more;And
his
eyes
<EOS>
they
grew
dim
,
and
his
cheeks
they
grew
pale
,
For
he
felt
he
was
gazing
his
last
on
the
vale
.
<EOS>
Slowly
he
turnedFrom
that
sweet
quiet
spot;One
struggle
and
allLife
's
bright
scenes
seemed
forgot;And
far
down
the
mountain
the
Rover
's
voice
rang
,
<EOS>
As
in
musical
tones
thus
wildly
he
sang:`Ha
,
ha
,
ha!—ha
,
ha
,
ha!I'm
a
Rover
and
free;And
the
wide
world
is
mine

Over

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ronald
,
with
animation
,
as
the
last
notes
died
away
.
"
<EOS>
Well
sung
!
<EOS>
and
apropos
<EOS>
:
there
is
something
in
the
song
much
in
unison
with
my
own
feelings
;
and
somehow
there
seems
a
connection
between
the
Rover
and
myself
.
<EOS>
Where
learned
you
the
song?""In
a
southern
city
,
of
a
traveling
minstrel
.
<EOS>
""It
reminds
me
forcibly
of
my
boyhood
days
,
"
returned
Ronald
,
with
a
half
-
stifled
sigh
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
said
Inez
,
gazing
earnestly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
You
have
often
promised
me
the
story
of
your
birth
,
Ronald
;
why
not
tell
it
me
now?""I
would
have
told
you
ere
this
,
love
;
but
somehow
the
recalling
of
the
golden
days
of
youth
,
the
revival
of
the
past
,
ever
tends
to
make
me
sad
;
and
you
know
I
dislike
being
sad
,
Inez
.
<EOS>
But
no
matter
—
you
shall
have
the
story
now
;
there
will
perhaps
never
be
a
time
more
appropriate
.
<EOS>
Cyntha
,
you
may
leave
us
;
"
and
as
the
slave
departed
,
he
continued
:
"
Prepare
yourself
to
listen
—
so
runs
the
tale:"England
is
the
land
of
my
nativity
.
<EOS>
My
mother
,
God
rest
her
soul
!
<EOS>
I
well
remember
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
those
sweet
,
gentle
,
affectionate
,
sensitive
beings
,
that
occasionally
find
their
way
into
this
world
of
sorrow
and
strife
,
as
though
to
remind
man
if
the
picture
be
dark
,
it
has
its
bright
,
sunny
spots
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
woman
on
whom
none
could
gaze
with
feelings
of
indifference
.
<EOS>
She
was
herself
all
soul
,
all
feeling
;
one
whose
eyes
would
ever
grow
dim
at
a
tale
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
I
loved
her!—with
<EOS>
what
wild
,
passionate
devotion
!
<EOS>
My
very
existence
seemed
centered
in
hers
;
and
the
very
idea
of
a
separation
by
death
would
often
fill
my
young
eyes
with
tears
.
<EOS>
I
remember
we
lived
in
comfortable
circumstances
.
<EOS>
We
occupied
a
beautiful
little
cottage
,
surrounded
by
a
landscape
variegated
and
pleasing
,
stretching
far
away
in
gentle
undulations
,
like
the
swell
of
the
ocean
in
a
calm
,
and
ending
in
hills
,
which
to
my
young
fancy
seemed
rising
as
guardians
to
overlook
and
watch
the
valley
below
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
delightful
quiet
about
the
spot
,
which
even
as
I
recall
it
lends
a
soothing
influence
to
my
restless
,
turbulent
spirit
.
<EOS>
Near
to
our
cottage
was
a
shady
grove
,
through
which
slowly
meandered
a
lovely
stream
,
on
whose
velvet
-
like
banks
I
have
lingered
many
an
hour
,
angling
for
the
finy
tribe
in
its
placid
bosom
.
<EOS>
In
the
more
immediate
vicinity
of
the
cottage
was
a
garden
of
flowers
,
of
all
kinds
and
hues
,
and
the
walls
themselves
were
shaded
by
the
creeping
,
clinging
ivy
.
<EOS>
The
whole
scene
might
be
described
as
a
perfect
picture
of
domestic
happiness
;
and
to
this
and
my
mother
's
gentle
disposition
,
I
have
ever
felt
myself
indebted
for
those
finer
feelings
which
are
so
foreign
to
my
present
occupation
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
seeming
happiness
<EOS>
(
<EOS>
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
reality
has
taught
me
that
if
we
fathom
the
human
heart
we
shall
find
in
most
cases
that
what
we
took
for
happiness
was
but
the
seeming
)
<EOS>
there
was
sorrow
even
in
that
cottage
—
in
the
heart
of
my
own
beloved
mother
.
<EOS>
It
often
appeared
strange
to
me
,
even
in
my
earliest
days
,
that
I
never
saw
my
father
,
that
I
never
heard
my
mother
speak
of
him
;
and
when
curiosity
excited
me
to
enquire
of
her
—
as
it
sometimes
would
—
the
reason
,
she
ever
grew
sad
,
melancholy
,
and
put
me
off
with
the
answer
that
she
would
inform
me
at
some
future
time
—
that
I
was
not
yet
enough
advanced
in
years
to
understand
.
<EOS>
This
of
course
but
added
fuel
to
the
flame
;
<EOS>
but
as
I
saw
the
question
ever
pained
her
,
I
finally
dropped
it
altogether
,
trusting
that
she
would
inform
me
in
her
own
good
time
.
<EOS>
"She
was
a
woman
of
fine
taste
and
education
,
and
under
her
own
instructions
I
was
early
taught
to
read
and
write
;
and
possessing
a
choice
library
of
poetry
and
romance
,
and
my
mind
being
naturally
bent
in
that
channel
<EOS>
,
I
took
to
books
with
great
avidity
,
and
whiled
away
many
a
long
evening
,
or
what
would
otherwise
have
been
so
,
in
reading
to
her
such
passages
as
I
fancied
most
in
accordance
with
her
gentle
spirit
.
<EOS>
Thus
passed
the
first
twelve
and
happiest
years
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
"Feeling
<EOS>
that
I
had
now
arrived
at
the
proper
age
,
and
that
it
was
a
duty
she
owed
me
<EOS>
,
she
determined
on
sending
me
to
school
;
and
though
the
idea
of
parting
with
me
was
painful
,
yet
as
she
felt
it
was
for
my
own
benefit
<EOS>
she
did
so
,
the
pleadings
of
duty
became
paramount
to
feeling
,
and
unknown
to
myself
every
thing
was
arranged
for
my
departure
.
<EOS>
When
she
first
broke
the
news
to
me
,
it
came
like
the
shock
of
an
unexpected
thunder
-
bolt
;
nor
could
I
believe
her
really
in
earnest
until
she
had
thrice
reiterated
it
.
<EOS>
Never
shall
I
forget
the
feelings
which
the
thought
of
separation
occasioned
.
<EOS>
Separation
had
been
the
one
secret
dread
of
my
life
;
but
it
had
been
the
separation
of
death
only
—
voluntary
separation
having
never
entered
my
mind
.
<EOS>
She
at
once
perceived
my
feelings
—
for
they
found
a
sad
echo
in
her
own
heart
,
and
by
gentle
reasoning
sought
to
convince
me
of
the
necessity
and
benefit
of
our
parting
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
She
informed
me
it
was
in
her
power
to
give
me
an
education
;
but
beyond
that
little
or
nothing
;
and
she
felt
anxious
I
should
gain
that
,
which
,
whatever
misfortunes
might
befal
me
in
after
years
,
would
ever
be
mine
.
<EOS>
I
listened
to
<EOS>
her,—I
saw
her
mind
was
bent
upon
it
,
and
I
acquiesced
,
without
a
word
of
murmur
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
<EOS>
and
we
parted
;
but
sad
,
most
sad
,
was
the
parting
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
Inez
,
but
the
thought
of
it
makes
me
childish
,
"
and
Ronald
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
and
for
a
few
moments
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
"Never
<EOS>
,
"
he
resumed
at
length
,
"
shall
I
forget
her
sweet
,
mournful
features
,
as
she
stood
gazing
upon
me
,
on
the
morning
of
my
departure
,
with
a
look
wherein
was
concentrated
all
the
deep
yearnings
of
a
mother
's
heart
,
for
a
son
she
might
never
behold
again
;
and
doubtless
there
was
a
presentiment
of
this
kind
at
work
within
her
,
—
for
when
we
came
to
the
final
adieu
,
she
clasped
me
to
her
heart
,
almost
convulsively,—the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks,—and
<EOS>
it
was
with
difficulty
she
could
utter
,
`
God
bless
you
,
my
son!—farewell
!
<EOS>
If
we
never
meet
again'—she
paused
—
`
forget
not
my
memory
!
'
<EOS>
My
feelings
,
Inez
,
you
may
imagine
;
I
can
not
describe
them
—
words
are
too
weak
.
<EOS>
Thus
we
parted"—Ronald
paused
as
if
struggling
with
some
deep
emotion
,
and
them
added
,
faintly—"forever!""Forever
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Inez
,
involuntarily
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
forever
!
<EOS>
But
—
the
story:—I
must
be
more
brief
.
<EOS>
The
school
to
which
I
was
sent
was
some
hundred
miles
distant
,
and
was
one
,
if
truth
must
be
said
,
better
calculated
to
learn
me
in
the
ways
and
vices
of
the
world
,
than
in
knowledge
of
books
.
<EOS>
I
was
there
thrown
among
all
classes
,
and
left
without
a
guide
to
choose
my
companions
.
<EOS>
Naturally
of
a
bold
,
reckless
disposition
,
I
unfortunately
became
a
favorite
of
the
worst
class
;
and
by
degrees
was
led
into
scenes
of
revelry
and
wickedness
,
of
the
existence
of
which
,
ere
<EOS>
I
went
there
,
I
had
never
even
dreamed
.
<EOS>
It
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
dwell
in
detail
;
suffice
it
,
therefore
,
that
at
the
end
of
three
years
I
left
the
school
in
disgrace
.
<EOS>
An
hour
after
my
dismissal
,
I
received
the
news
of
the
death
of
my
mother
,
the
only
friend
I
had
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
were
my
feelings
!
<EOS>
I
have
an
indistinct
recollection
of
a
pressure
—
a
whirl
—
a
fire
in
my
brain
,
and
I
knew
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
was
mad
—
raving
mad
!
<EOS>
The
messenger
who
bore
me
the
news
,
bore
me
home
a
maniac
.
<EOS>
Home
,
no
!
<EOS>
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
it
was
home
no
longer
!
<EOS>
Ere
I
recovered
my
reason
,
my
mother
was
mouldering
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
dwell
on
my
feelings
of
grief
and
utter
desolation
,
when
I
again
comprehended
all:—the
subject
is
too
painful
,
and
other
matters
press
me
for
narration
.
<EOS>
The
only
legacy
left
me
was
a
sealed
package
,
which
I
opened
with
a
trembling
hand
—
the
contents
I
distinctly
remember
,
<EOS>
for
they
are
engraved
upon
the
very
tablets
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
A
letter
within
,
ran
thus:"`My
<EOS>
dear
son
,
God
be
with
you
!
<EOS>
I
am
dying
,
and
can
never
see
you
again
on
earth
,
but
will
in
the
land
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
My
strength
is
failing
—
I
have
but
a
few
minutes
to
live
,
and
will
devote
them
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
often
questioned
me
of
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
have
delayed
answering
<EOS>
you,—but
<EOS>
the
time
has
now
come
when
it
is
necessary
you
should
know
all
.
<EOS>
God
give
me
strength
to
pen
,
and
you
to
read
the
secret
of
my
life!—and
Ronald
,
dear
Ronald
,
whatever
you
do
,
do
not
reproach
,
do
not
curse
my
memory
!
<EOS>
I
shall
enter
but
little
into
detail
,
for
time
and
strength
will
not
permit
.
<EOS>
At
the
age
of
twelve
I
was
left
an
orphan
,
and
was
taken
in
charge
of
some
distant
relatives
of
my
mother
,
with
whom
I
lived
in
easy
circumstances
,
until
the
age
of
sixteen
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
wealthy
,
and
yet
had
enough
wherewithal
to
live
independent
.
<EOS>
They
treated
me
with
much
affection
,
and
life
passed
pleasantly
for
four
years
.
<EOS>
At
the
age
of
sixteen
,
I
accidentally
became
acquainted
with
Walter
Langdon
,
only
son
of
Sir
Edgar
Langdon
,
whose
large
estate
and
residence
—
for
he
was
very
wealthy
—
was
but
a
few
miles
distant
.
<EOS>
He
found
opportunity
and
declared
his
attachment
,
but
at
the
same
time
informed
me
that
our
relations
on
either
side
would
be
opposed
to
our
union
,
and
begged
me
to
make
no
mention
of
it
,
but
to
prepare
myself
and
elope
with
him
;
that
when
the
ceremony
was
over
,
and
no
alternative
,
all
parties
would
become
reconciled
.
<EOS>
He
was
young
,
handsome
,
and
accomplished
—
his
powers
of
conversation
brilliant
.
<EOS>
He
plead
with
a
warmth
of
passion
I
could
not
withstand
—
for
know
,
<EOS>
Ronald
,
I
loved
him
,
with
the
ardent
first
love
of
a
girl
of
sixteen
,
and
I
consented
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Ronald
,
that
I
am
forced
to
tell
you
more
:
this
rash
act
was
my
ruin!"`My
strength
is
failing
<EOS>
so
rapidly
I
can
not
enter
into
particulars
,
my
son,—and
<EOS>
yet
,
why
should
I?—they
would
only
pain
you
to
read
,
and
me
to
write
.
<EOS>
Suffice
,
Ronald
,
that
he
deceived
me
—
<EOS>
I
became
his
victim
--
and
you
,
<EOS>
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
you
are
the
offspring
of
our
guilt
.
<EOS>
"`Shortly
<EOS>
after
this
I
learned
,
to
my
horror
,
that
he
had
united
himself
with
a
lady
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
He
afterward
saw
me
and
offered
me
the
reparation
of
money:—alas
!
<EOS>
what
a
reparation
to
one
whose
hopes
were
ruined
!
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
you
,
my
son
,
I
never
would
have
lived
to
feel
my
disgrace
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
I
accepted
his
offer
,
on
condition
that
he
would
never
see
me
more
.
<EOS>
To
this
he
reluctantly
consented
,
and
gave
me
a
life
lease
of
the
place
where
you
were
reared
,
and
settled
on
me
a
certain
annuity
,
which
ceases
at
my
death
.
<EOS>
By
economy
I
have
been
enabled
to
save
a
thousand
pounds
,
which
is
here
enclosed
.
<EOS>
Take
it
,
Ronald
,
and
may
God
enable
you
to
live
an
honest
life
.
<EOS>
Poor
boy
!
<EOS>
you
are
homeless
—
friendless
,
—
for
she
who
has
watched
over
and
loved
you
as
only
a
mother
can
,
will
,
ere
<EOS>
this
reaches
you
,
be
in
her
grave
.
<EOS>
God
support
you
,
dear
Ronald
!
<EOS>
But
for
the
thought
of
your
grief
and
suffering
,
I
could
die
contented
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
save
you
,
no
friend
on
earth,—all
have
thrown
me
off
and
treated
me
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
it
is
all
for
the
best
;
may
God
forgive
them
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
just
punishment
for
my
sin
;
and
yet
it
is
hard
—
very
,
very
hard
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Ronald
--
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
Ronald!--
<EOS>
that
I
could
see
you
once
again
—
could
clasp
you
once
more
to
this
broken
heart
—
could
feel
you
close
my
aching
<EOS>
eyes!—but
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
it
can
not
be
—
death
is
upon
me
!
<EOS>
I
feel
it
in
my
palsying
limbs
—
my
leaden
eye
-
lids
--
my
struggling
breath
.
<EOS>
I
would
advise
you
,
but
I
can
not
;
I
leave
you
to
act
as
you
think
proper
;
but
,
my
son
,
do
nothing
rash
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Ronald
,
do
not
curse
me!—will
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
but
knew
you
would
forgive
me!—but
—
ah!—God!—I
am
going
.
<EOS>
Adieu
!
<EOS>
adieu!—Ronald
,
bear
your
mother
's
name
,
and
drop
a
tear
upon
the
earth
that
covers
her

Farewell

farewell!Clarrisse

'CHAPTER
<EOS>
I."Oh
!
<EOS>
Gods
!
<EOS>
Inez
,
what
think
you
were
my
feelings
,
when
I
read
this
?
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
all
the
demons
of
hell
itself
were
at
work
within
my
heart
!
<EOS>
Is
this
the
world
?
<EOS>
cried
<EOS>
I.
Do
men
live
and
pass
unpunished
—
ay
!
<EOS>
and
more!—are
they
courted
by
the
world
,
<EOS>
that
trample
upon
and
break
the
hearts
of
God
's
loveliest
images
?
<EOS>
Does
society
uphold
men
in
deeds
of
wickedness
that
would
even
blacken
the
character
of
hell
's
archfiend
?
<EOS>
Do
they
drag
man
before
their
mock
tribunals
,
and
sentence
him
to
rot
in
prison
,
because
necessity
forced
him
to
take
a
morsel
of
bread
to
save
himself
and
offspring
from
starvation
?
<EOS>
Is
this
society?—is
<EOS>
this
the
boasted
land
of
justice
and
religion
?
<EOS>
Then
deliver
me
from
it!—then
let
me
war
against
it!—ay
!
<EOS>
let
me
be
an
outlaw
from
that
society
,
which
is
itself
an
outlaw
from
all
that
is
good
!
<EOS>
Such
were
the
thoughts
,
Inez
,
that
rushed
forth
from
my
burning
brain
!
<EOS>
Boy
I
was
in
years
,
but
boy
no
longer
!
<EOS>
I
felt
I
was
alone
in
a
world
black
,
with
sin
,
and
must
choose
and
act
for
myself
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
I
without
experience
.
<EOS>
The
last
three
years
of
my
life
,
if
not
in
book
learning
,
had
advanced
me
much
in
knowledge
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
A
change
had
come
over
me
.
<EOS>
Once
I
thought
of
nothing
but
innocent
affections
and
happy
dreams
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
Now
clouds
dark
and
gloomy
rose
in
wild
fantastic
shapes
before
me
.
<EOS>
And
life
,
what
was
it
?
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
and
what
was
I
?
<EOS>
What
hopes
had
I
of
brightness
?
<EOS>
A
being
of
noble
birth
,
but
not
I
galized
by
the
laws
of
the
land
,
sent
into
the
world
to
be
the
jeer
of
my
fellows
!
<EOS>
I
,
son
of
Sir
Walter
Langdon
—
for
he
had
now
assumed
the
title
of
his
father
,
deceased
—
who
by
right
should
claim
his
affection
,
to
be
looked
upon
by
him
—
by
my
own
father
—
as
a
being
low
-
born
,
and
perhaps
spurned
from
his
presence
,
should
I
seek
him
out
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
these
thoughts
crowded
upon
me!"I
went
abroad
,
young
as
I
was
,
and
visited
the
principal
cities
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
three
years
I
returned
to
England
,
exhausted
in
funds
,
and
for
the
first
time
determined
on
visiting
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
sought
him
out
and
stood
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
demanded
my
name
and
business
.
<EOS>
My
name
,
I
replied
,
is
one
you
will
long
remember
:
<EOS>
Ronald
Bonardi
,
or
Ronald
Langdon
,
as
circumstances
may
be
.
<EOS>
He
turned
pale
and
his
eye
sunk
before
my
steady
gaze
;
then
recovering
his
self
-
possession
,
he
bade
me
begone
and
never
enter
his
presence
again
—
said
he
knew
me
not
—
that
I
was
a
base
imposter
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Inez
,
that
moment
had
nearly
been
fatal
to
him
,
such
a
wild
passion
was
aroused
within
me
!
<EOS>
I
could
feel
the
blood
drop
by
drop
retreating
to
my
heart
,
and
I
fairly
reeled
.
<EOS>
Such
words
from
my
father
—
from
the
author
of
my
existence
—
nearly
dethroned
my
reason
!
<EOS>
By
a
mighty
effort
I
conquered
myself
and
replied
,
my
lips
quivering
with
suppressed
passion
,
that
I
would
leave
on
one
condition
and
never
see
him
more
.
<EOS>
He
demanded
it
.
<EOS>
Money
!
<EOS>
was
my
only
answer
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
money
<EOS>
and
I
left
;
<EOS>
but
ere
<EOS>
I
did
,
I
told
him
the
orphan
's
curse
was
on
him
;
ay
!
<EOS>
father
though
he
was
,
I
cursed
and
left
him
trembling
.
<EOS>
That
curse
,
Inez
,
was
fulfilled
—
terribly
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
then
in
the
bloom
of
health
,
shortly
after
died
.
<EOS>
His
son
,
near
my
own
age
,
was
murdered
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
,
then
some
three
years
of
age
,
disappeared
suddenly
;
and
he
,
to
sum
up
,
survived
but
a
few
months
—
dying
a
maniac
—
and
his
estate
passed
into
the
hands
of
another
.
<EOS>
By
what
singular
fatality
<EOS>
I
was
avenged
,
I
know
not
<EOS>
;
but
so
was
the
termination
.
<EOS>
"I
came
to
America
,
and
caring
little
what
became
of
me
,
led
a
dissolute
life
.
<EOS>
For
twelve
years
I
traveled
through
the
States
a
professional
gambler
.
<EOS>
This
course
of
life
tended
to
harden
me
to
almost
any
deed
whereby
I
might
be
the
gainer
in
the
shape
of
gold
,
that
glittering
earth
to
which
all
classes
bow
in
humble
reverence
.
<EOS>
By
chance
I
fell
in
with
a
lawless
band
of
desperadoes
,
who
,
through
a
fancy
I
never
could
account
for
,
chose
me
for
their
leader
.
<EOS>
I
accepted
the
office
on
condition
that
I
should
have
absolute
sway
so
long
as
remained
their
chief
,
and
that
they
would
allow
me
to
organize
them
as
I
saw
proper
.
<EOS>
To
this
,
without
a
dissenting
voice
,
they
consented
,
and
I
was
elected
captain
for
the
term
of
five
years
.
<EOS>
My
first
proceeding
was
to
find
a
safe
rendezvous
and
establish
such
a
code
of
laws
as
I
deemed
most
beneficial
to
us
as
a
body
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
,
and
it
is
needless
to
tell
you
this
was
the
place
chosen
for
our
secret
retreat
.
<EOS>
For
two
years
,
Inez
,
ere
I
saw
you
,
I
led
a
wild
life
;
and
though
by
my
deeds
I
made
myself
an
outlaw
,
yet
to
this
day
my
hands
are
free
from
the
stain
of
blood
;
still
I
fear
,
if
,
I
remain
much
longer
chief
,
I
shall
have
to
put
in
force
a
law
,
which
,
as
executioner
,
will
not
leave
me
guiltless
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
you
,
Ronald
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Inez
,
quickly
,
who
had
been
listening
to
his
story
with
breathless
attention
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
disaffection
creeping
into
our
ranks
,
which
I
fear
will
result
in
treachery
and
mutiny
.
<EOS>
Some
evidences
I
have
already
seen
.
<EOS>
To
the
offender
the
punishment
is
death
by
the
hands
of
the
chief
.
<EOS>
""God
<EOS>
save
you
from
such
a
crime
!
<EOS>
dear
Ronald
,
"
cried
Inez
,
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
gazing
tenderly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
gentle
Inez
,
"
said
Ronald
,
with
deep
emotion
,
tenderly
embracing
her
,
"
why
should
fate
doom
you
to
be
linked
to
a
bandit
chief
?
—
<EOS>
Was
there
no
better
destiny
in
store
for
you?""I
murmur
not
,
Ronald
,
"
replied
Inez
,
sweetly
.
<EOS>
"True
,
you
do
not
;
yet
am
I
not
blind
to
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
When
first
I
saw
you
,
dearest
Inez
,
<EOS>
three
years
since
,
I
felt
what
it
was
to
love
—
never
till
then
.
<EOS>
In
disguise
I
sought
your
acquaintance
;
in
disguise
I
won
your
affections
;
but
my
love
was
deep
and
true
,
and
in
disguise
I
could
not
we
d
you
.
<EOS>
No
!
base
as
I
had
been
—
base
as
I
then
was
—
a
bandit
chief
—
an
outlaw
from
society
<EOS>
—
I
could
not
farther
deceive
the
only
being
I
loved
on
earth
.
<EOS>
It
was
painful
,
very
painful
,
to
think
that
I
must
tear
myself
from
you
,
and
perchance
never
see
you
more
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
many
sleepless
nights
it
cost
me
!
<EOS>
how
much
heart
rending
misery
!
<EOS>
But
my
resolution
was
taken
.
<EOS>
I
loved
you
,
and
would
not
drag
you
to
perdition
.
<EOS>
I
would
tell
you
all
and
part
forever
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
all
;
but
O
,
what
was
my
surprise
—
my
joy
—
when
instead
of
spurning
me
from
your
sight
,
you
told
me
with
your
own
sweet
lips
our
fates
were
one
!
<EOS>
For
a
time
,
sweet
Inez
,
I
could
not
believe
it
reality
;
that
there
was
for
the
outcast
so
much
joy
in
store
;
but
the
altar
proved
it
true
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
Inez
,
I
have
never
been
the
same
being
.
<EOS>
Then
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
long
career
of
crime
,
did
I
feel
guilt
;
for
the
first
time
sighed
to
be
an
honest
man
.
<EOS>
But
my
oath
as
bandit
chief
bound
me
for
five
years
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
break
it
,
and
three
years
had
yet
to
expire
.
<EOS>
Those
three
years
,
Inez
,
you
have
shared
with
me
;
have
been
the
sunlight
of
my
existence
;
have
tended
to
make
me
a
better
man
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
my
term
of
office
expires
,
and
I
am
released
from
my
oath
.
<EOS>
""To
-
day
,
Ronald
,
dear
Ronald
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Inez
,
in
a
transport
of
joy
;
"
and
you
will
leave
this
place
then
,
will
you
not?""Ah
!
<EOS>
Inez
,
that
is
what
troubles
me
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
a
leader
must
be
chosen
.
<EOS>
By
a
law
which
with
us
is
as
unchangeable
as
those
of
the
Medes
and
Persians
,
if
one
of
our
band
be
chosen
without
a
dissenting
vote
,
to
the
office
of
chief
,
he
is
bound
to
accept
.
<EOS>
If
but
one
vote
be
cast
against
him
he
can
act
his
pleasure
—
two
-
thirds
of
the
members
present
being
sufficient
,
if
in
favor
,
to
constitute
him
duly
elected
.
<EOS>
I
fear
a
re
-
election
without
a
dissenting
voice
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
can
you
not
bribe
some
one
to
vote
against
you?""The
offer
,
Inez
,
is
punishable
with
death
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
must
bide
the
result
,
and
that
result
I
fear
.
<EOS>
I
would
that
I
could
be
released
and
left
to
retire
to
some
secluded
spot
in
quiet
to
enjoy
the
company
of
my
own
dear
Inez
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
a
child
of
fate
and
must
submit
to
the
decree
of
destiny
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
again
elected
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
fear
I
shall
,
in
my
official
capacity
,
be
compelled
to
act
in
a
manner
foreign
to
my
present
feelings
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
we
have
of
late
been
very
inactive
,
and
there
has
been
dissatisfaction
expressed
in
regard
to
it
by
some
of
the
members
.
<EOS>
Already
preparations
are
being
made
for
an
attack
on
a
rich
planter
,
whose
estate
lying
in
Tennessee
,
borders
on
the
Mississippi
in
a
manner
favorable
to
our
design
;
and
I
,
as
captain
of
the
banditti
,
must
head
the
expedition
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
Ronald
,
"
sighed
Inez
,
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
Inez
,
"
returned
Ronald
,
"
that
fate
should
will
it
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
fate
!
<EOS>
fate
!
<EOS>
Without
there
,
ho
!
<EOS>
who
knocks
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
some
one
in
the
Outer
Cave
,
who
had
given
the
signal
for
the
chief
,
by
three
distinct
raps
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
presence
of
our
captain
is
needed
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"I
come
,
"
returned
Ronald
;
and
pressing
his
lips
once
more
to
those
of
Inez
,
he
hastily
arose
and
quitted
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
Inez
gazed
after
him
in
silence
for
a
time
;
and
then
bending
over
her
guitar
,
sung
a
low
,
sweet
,
mournful
strain
.

CHAPTER
II.THE
MEETING
OF
THE
BANDITTI
—
THE
ADDRESS
—
<EOS>
THE
SUSPICION
—
THE
ELECTION
—
<EOS>
THE
APPOINTMENT
THE
INITIATION
—
<EOS>
THE
OATH.The
night
succeeding
the
day
in
which
we
have
introduced
the
reader
into
the
grand
rendezvous
of
the
banditti
,
was
densely
dark
.
<EOS>
Clouds
low
and
heavy
canopied
the
heavens
and
veiled
the
light
of
moon
and
stars
.
<EOS>
To
add
to
the
gloom
without
,
was
a
thick
fog
and
drizzly
rain
,
which
completely
forbade
all
objects
to
the
eye
,
unless
aided
by
artificial
light
.
<EOS>
Within
the
larger
cave
,
running
through
its
centre
,
was
a
row
of
torches
,
whose
red
,
flickering
glare
gave
each
thing
a
somewhat
sombre
and
fantastical
appearance
.
<EOS>
Near
the
farther
end
stood
a
group
of
four
figures
,
coarsely
habited
,
whose
large
statures
and
brawny
limbs
gave
evidence
of
great
animal
power
.
<EOS>
Their
features
,
by
the
light
of
the
torches
,
were
anything
but
preposessing
,
and
varied
in
expression
only
by
the
inner
workings
of
fierce
passions
.
<EOS>
They
were
evidently
on
some
exciting
topic
,
for
their
gesticulations
were
quick
and
fierce
,
their
language
low
and
energetic
,
occasionally
mingled
with
a
guttural
oath
,
which
,
like
the
distant
sound
of
thunder
,
told
of
the
accumulating
storm
of
passion
ere
long
to
burst
in
fury
on
some
devoted
head
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
wore
coat
or
vest
;
but
a
coarse
shirt
covered
their
shoulders
,
and
being
entirely
open
in
front
,
left
their
broad
,
bronzed
bosoms
free
.
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
one
,
their
muscular
arms
were
bare
;
this
exception
being
doubtless
caused
by
an
accident
,
as
the
owner
carried
his
arm
in
a
sling
.
<EOS>
Around
each
waist
passed
a
belt
,
in
which
,
convenient
to
the
hand
,
were
placed
pistols
,
knives
and
daggers
,
ready
for
use
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
the
conversation
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
low
and
hurried
;
but
at
length
a
voice
,
as
though
passion
had
got
the
better
of
prudence
,
exclaimed
somewhat
loudly:"Hang
me
,
but
they
shall
both
die
!
<EOS>
I—""Hush
,
fool
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
another
;
"
would
ye
spoil
all
with
your
imprudence
?
<EOS>
We
may
be
overheard
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
and
again
the
voices
died
away
to
a
murmur
.
<EOS>
Leaving
them
to
the
plotting
of
their
own
dark
deeds
,
we
will
now
turn
our
attention
to
another
part
of
the
cave
.
<EOS>
We
have
previously
mentioned
,
that
to
enter
this
retreat
,
you
must
descend
abruptly
some
fifteen
feet
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
by
means
of
a
ladder
,
which
could
be
removed
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
this
ladder
,
day
and
night
,
paced
a
sentinel
,
whose
imperious
orders
were
to
admit
no
one
,
not
even
the
chief
himself
,
without
the
password
and
countersign
;
and
furthermore
,
should
any
individual
,
be
he
chief
or
not
,
persist
in
advancing
without
giving
both
pass
-
word
and
countersign
,
after
being
three
times
warned
of
the
consequences
,
it
should
be
the
duty
of
the
sentinel
to
fire
on
said
person
with
intent
to
take
life
;
in
failure
whereof
,
or
being
found
asleep
on
his
post
,
his
own
life
was
the
forfeit
.
<EOS>
For
farther
safety
against
a
sudden
attack
,
was
a
trap
door
exactly
under
the
entrance
,
so
constructed
,
that
by
touching
a
secret
spring
it
would
fly
open
and
leave
an
aperture
some
fifty
feet
in
depth
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
were
sharp
stones
,
so
placed
that
no
living
body
could
fall
on
them
from
above
and
survive
the
shock
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
the
ladder
mentioned
,
on
the
evening
in
question
,
paced
the
sentinel
,
with
the
steady
gait
and
regular
wheel
of
an
old
soldier
—
bearing
on
his
shoulder
a
rifle
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
nothing
was
heard
but
the
murmur
of
the
voices
already
spoken
of
,
and
his
own
measured
tread
.
<EOS>
At
length
a
sound
,
like
the
plash
of
an
oar
,
fell
upon
his
ear
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
pausing
,
he
bent
his
head
forward
in
a
listening
attitude
;
and
then
,
as
if
satisfied
all
was
right
,
resumed
his
walk
.
<EOS>
But
little
time
elapsed
ere
the
sound
of
oars
was
heard
distinctly
,
and
the
hum
of
voices
from
without
.
<EOS>
Directly
came
a
sound
like
the
striking
of
an
oar
three
times
flatwise
upon
the
water
,
when
the
sentinel
paused
,
and
in
a
quick
,
sharp
voice
,
sung
out:"Heta
benare?""Ele
lio
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"Come
forward
and
give
the
pass
and
countersign!"A
figure
instantly
stood
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
crossed
his
arms
on
his
breast
,
drew
a
dagger
from
his
belt
,
passed
it
across
his
neck
,
touched
the
point
to
his
heart
,
and
returned
it
;
all
of
which
was
done
with
a
rapid
motion
,
uttering
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
pass
-
word
:
"
Eliona!""All
right
—
descend
!
"
returned
the
sentinel
;
and
as
the
figure
passed
down
,
another
stood
in
the
entrance
,
went
through
the
same
ceremony
,
and
was
followed
in
quick
succession
by
some
fifty
others
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
signal
was
given
that
all
had
entered
,
and
the
last
comer
took
up
his
position
as
sentinel
on
the
outside
of
the
cave
,
while
the
other
kept
his
round
within
as
usual
.
<EOS>
The
group
we
have
mentioned
previously
,
on
the
entrance
of
the
new
comers
dispersed
and
mingled
with
them
.
<EOS>
For
some
ten
minutes
there
was
a
general
hum
of
voices
,
engaged
on
different
topics
,
when
suddenly
Ronald
came
forth
from
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
,
and
all
was
silent
.
<EOS>
With
a
dignified
step
he
proceeded
to
and
mounted
the
platform
or
stand
,
where
he
was
greeted
with
three
loud
,
hearty
cheers
.
<EOS>
As
he
listened
to
this
spontaneous
tribute
to
his
popularity
,
his
dark
eye
flashed
,
a
look
of
pride
shot
across
his
stern
,
dark
features
,
and
raising
his
hand
to
command
silence
<EOS>
,
he
thus
addressed
the
assemblage:"Gentlemen
and
brothers:—To
me
<EOS>
,
I
must
confess
,
the
present
moment
is
a
proud
one
;
for
it
revives
the
time
when
,
with
one
universal
voice
as
it
were
,
you
proclaimed
me
your
captain
—
<EOS>
gave
me
,
a
stranger
,
your
confidence
;
which
you
are
aware
,
as
well
as
myself
,
was
no
less
than
placing
your
lives
at
my
disposal
;
and
shows
that
your
confidence
in
me
is
still
unshaken
.
<EOS>
Five
years
ago
,
this
night
,
I
was
elected
your
chief
;
in
doing
which
you
made
my
simplest
word
an
imper
ative
law
.
<EOS>
That
you
should
confer
at
a
venture
<EOS>
such
honor
,
such
absolute
rule
,
on
myself
,
on
one
you
had
never
even
proved
,
was
,
and
remains
to
this
day
with
me
a
matter
of
surprise
and
mystery
.
<EOS>
What
I
had
done
previously
to
merit
your
confidence
,
I
know
not
;
but
I
felt
at
that
moment
,
gentlemen
,
that
as
you
considered
me
worthy
to
govern
you
,
I
would
throw
the
whole
strength
of
my
mind
,
would
concentrate
my
whole
thoughts
upon
one
theme
,
which
should
be
for
your
prosperity
;
and
to
prove
,
if
possible
,
your
confidence
not
misplaced
.
<EOS>
That
I
have
succeeded
,
I
feel
in
the
welcome
sound
of
your
glad
voices
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
,
and
a
universal
shout
echoed
through
the
cave
.
"For
<EOS>
five
years
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
I
have
been
your
leader
;
and
by
this
means
,
as
you
are
well
aware
,
have
made
myself
an
outlaw
,
and
a
price
has
been
set
on
the
head
of
the
bandit
chief
.
<EOS>
That
I
do
not
fear
being
betrayed
—
that
I
do
not
fear
,
notwithstanding
this
,
to
mingle
in
society
,
even
where
danger
is
the
most
apparent
—
you
,
gentlemen
,
from
my
actions
,
can
bear
ample
witness
:
but
,
gentlemen
,
in
regard
to
this
matter
for
the
future
,
I
would
ask
a
favor
.
<EOS>
"You
are
aware
,
at
least
most
of
you
,
that
three
years
ago
I
married
Inez
Orlandi
—
a
lady
of
noble
descent
,
<EOS>
whose
self
-
sacrificing
love
was
such
that
she
chose
life
with
me
,
a
bandit
,
rather
than
a
higher
destiny
—
or
at
least
what
the
world
would
term
a
higher
—
with
another
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
gentlemen
,
as
you
have
doubtless
perceived
,
I
have
never
been
the
same
being
—
have
never
taken
the
same
interest
in
the
rough
sports
of
our
wild
life
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
you
again
choose
a
leader
for
another
five
years
;
and
the
favor
I
would
ask
of
you
is
,
that
you
will
exempt
me
from
your
choice
.
<EOS>
Let
a
division
of
all
our
spoils
be
made
,
and
let
me
,
gentlemen
,
retire
into
private
life
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
wish
,
save
your
prosperity
,
nearest
my
heart
;
and
I
await
your
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Again
he
paused
,
and
the
cave
was
silent
as
the
hall
of
death
;
not
even
so
much
as
a
whisper
relieved
the
stillness
.
<EOS>
Each
appeared
taken
by
surprise
,
and
awaiting
the
answer
of
his
neighbor
.
<EOS>
Ronald
cast
a
hurried
glance
over
the
assemblage
,
and
read
in
their
grave
and
saddened
countenances
,
as
one
used
to
reading
the
thoughts
of
the
heart
by
the
features
,
that
he
would
meet
with
opposition
in
this
respect
,
even
from
those
who
loved
him
best
;
that
save
him
<EOS>
there
was
no
one
in
whom
they
would
be
united
;
that
,
in
short
,
he
was
the
man
of
their
choice
,
without
whom
disorganization
must
take
place
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
in
all
,
who
possess
strong
feelings
,
an
innate
pride
in
being
thought
the
first
in
his
profession
—
even
though
that
profession
be
to
gamble
or
steal
;
a
secret
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
in
his
line
he
is
popular
,
and
feeling
himself
that
he
excels
.
<EOS>
Such
thoughts
,
such
feelings
,
were
busy
in
the
breast
of
Ronald
,
as
his
eye
ran
over
the
group
;
and
pride
and
regret
were
struggling
within
him
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
Pride
,
that
his
services
were
held
in
such
high
esteem
by
those
who
had
tried
him
—
regret
,
that
he
could
not
retire
in
seclusion
to
enjoy
life
with
his
own
loved
Inez
.
<EOS>
But
the
struggle
was
but
momentary
.
<EOS>
Pride
was
,
perhaps
,
his
ruling
passion
;
and
even
here
pride
prevailed
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
look
upon
their
earnest
,
saddened
faces
,
at
his
loss
,
unmoved
;
and
with
an
animated
eye
,
and
a
flush
on
his
strongly
marked
features
,
that
gave
him
an
almost
noble
look
,
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion
,
he
said
.
<EOS>
"Gentlemen
,
you
speak
not
,
and
yet
I
am
answered
;
ay
,
loudly
answered
,
in
the
silence
that
reigns
around
me
—
<EOS>
in
the
sad
faces
of
those
who
were
wo
nt
to
be
joyous
in
my
success;—and
,
gentlemen
,
let
me
tell
you
,
whatever
may
have
been
my
feelings
in
asking
,
I
am
truly
proud
of
your
answer
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
gentlemen
,
you
have
decided
my
fate
!
<EOS>
Henceforth
I
am
with
you
—
<EOS>
with
my
life
will
I
serve
you!"It
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
scene
of
joyous
excitement
that
followed
this
announcement
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
Suffice
,
that
never
before
had
the
cave
echoed
such
prolonged
and
deafening
cheers
;
and
even
Inez
,
who
sat
with
her
head
bent
forward
,
in
the
Inner
Cave
,
raised
it
with
a
look
of
pride
,
although
she
felt
her
fondest
hopes
were
forever
destroyed
.
<EOS>
When
the
tumult
had
a
little
subsided
,
so
that
he
could
be
heard
,
Ronald
resumed:"Gentlemen
,
let
us
to
business
!
<EOS>
I
pray
you
be
seated
,
that
we
may
proceed
in
order
.
<EOS>
Piketon
,
you
will
call
the
roll
!
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
each
quietly
took
his
seat
on
one
of
the
benches
before
spoken
of
as
ranging
along
the
walls
,
with
the
exception
of
the
one
called
Piketon
,
who
stepped
forward
and
mounted
the
platform
beside
the
captain
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
broad
-
shouldered
,
muscular
man
,
with
tolerably
good
features,—an
eye
black
and
piercing
,
dark
hair
,
Roman
nose
—
of
a
look
rather
stern
than
villainous
,
and
some
thirty
years
of
age
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
too
,
about
him
an
expression
of
intelligence
superior
to
most
of
those
present
.
<EOS>
As
he
came
upon
the
stand
,
Ronald
handed
him
a
paper
,
containing
the
names
of
the
members
,
which
he
called
off
in
a
clear
,
distinct
voice
,
pricking
those
from
whom
no
answer
was
returned
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
many
present
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Ronald
.
<EOS>
Piketon
ran
his
eye
over
the
list
and
answered
:
"
Sixty
-
seven
,
excluding
the
sentinels
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
stands
on
duty
at
the
cave?""Moorehead
and
Farrar
.
<EOS>
""Morris
<EOS>
and
Parker
guard
the
Entrance
,
"
returned
Ronald
,
"
which
adds
four
,
leaving
absent
twenty
-
one
:
<EOS>
am
I
right?"Piketon
again
ran
his
eye
over
the
list
,
counting
the
names
pricked
,
and
answered
:
"
You
are
,
captain
.
<EOS>
""Four
of
the
absent
<EOS>
—
Lemly
,
Davis
,
Sulton
and
Vance
—
you
may
strike
off
altogether
,
"
said
Ronald
,
sadly:—"they
are
written
on
the
roll
of
eternity
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
poor
fellows
!
<EOS>
they
met
with
untimely
fates
—
the
first
two
shot
,
the
last
two
hung
—
a
warning
that
we
should
be
prudent
,
or
like
fates
may
be
our
own
.
<EOS>
Fourteen
of
the
absent
I
can
account
for
;
"
and
he
mentioned
their
names
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
scattered
throughout
the
United
States
—
two
in
New
Orleans
,
five
in
New
York
,
one
in
Boston
,
two
in
Philadelphia
,
two
in
Baltimore
,
and
two
in
Cincinnati
.
<EOS>
They
are
on
secret
service
,
acting
under
my
instructions
,
and
with
whom
I
am
holding
regular
correspondence
;
by
which
means
I
am
informed
of
every
thing
that
tends
to
the
benefit
of
our
society
—
such
as
the
description
of
travelers
bound
for
the
West
,
who
are
supposed
to
carry
money
,
and
the
best
method
of
obtaining
it
;
which
,
as
you
are
aware
,
gentlemen
,
we
have
not
unfrequently
done
by
gambling
.
<EOS>
Many
of
you
have
,
at
different
times
,
expressed
wonder
that
I
knew
so
well
how
to
choose
my
victims
;
and
I
have
deemed
it
no
more
than
right
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
to
explain
;
for
I
feel
you
are
all
entitled
to
my
confidence
.
<EOS>
"A
murmur
of
delighted
surprise
,
at
their
captain
's
ingenuity
,
now
ran
among
the
assemblage
,
and
ended
in
a
hearty
cheer
,
with
:
"
Long
live
<EOS>
Ronald
Bonardi!""Great
astonishment
,
I
ween
,
"
continued
the
captain
,
with
a
smile
,
"
would
some
of
the
nabobs
feel
,
did
they
know
,
when
sitting
down
to
a
quiet
game
of
cards
with
me
,
a
fellow
-
traveler
,
that
they
would
rise
completely
fleeced
by
Ronald
Bonardi
,
a
bandit
chief
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
Piketon
,
"
let
us
finish
our
business
.
<EOS>
There
are
three
names
not
yet
accounted
for
:
you
will
call
them!"Again
<EOS>
Piketon
scanned
the
list
closely
,
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
said
:
"
The
missing
are
Garrish
,
Riley
,
and
David
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Ronald
,
pressing
his
nether
lip
between
his
teeth
,
as
though
struck
by
a
sudden
thought:—"The
Jew
!
<EOS>
not
here
?
<EOS>
I
know
not
why
,
but
I
half
suspect
Ben
David
meditates
foul
play
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
'll
swear
to
'
t
,
cap'en
,
"
spoke
a
gruff
voice
,
from
one
of
the
benches
.
<EOS>
An
electric
thrill
appeared
to
run
through
the
assemblage
,
and
several
of
the
party
sprang
to
their
feet
,
grasping
the
handles
of
their
weapons
as
though
to
draw
them
.
<EOS>
"Pray
,
be
seated
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Ronald
,
waiving
his
hand
,
"
and
let
the
accuser
stand
forth
.
<EOS>
"
The
request
was
immediately
obeyed
;
and
the
individual
previously
mentioned
as
having
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
stepped
forward
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
large
frame
,
mostly
bone
and
muscle
,
having
a
head
much
too
large
for
his
body
,
with
features
coarse
and
repulsive
—
partly
covered
by
a
rough
,
dirt
-
brown
beard
—
a
large
nose
,
and
an
eye
every
way
villainous
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
of
a
similar
color
to
his
beard
—
was
long
,
coarse
and
matted
;
and
he
was
,
besides
,
stoop
-
shouldered
and
bow
-
legged
;
in
short
,
a
man
where
the
animal
was
wholly
predominant
.
<EOS>
His
age
might
be
forty
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
Curdish
,
"
continued
Ronald
,
eyeing
him
steadily
,
"
is
it
you
,
his
friend
,
that
accuse
him?""I
<EOS>
do
n't
exactly
reckon
myself
his
friend
,
"
growled
Curdish
,
with
an
oath
;
"
though
I
have
did
him
some
favors
.
<EOS>
""By
reason
of
which
you
have
doubtless
suffered
some
of
late
,
"
added
Ronald
,
pointing
to
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
happened
it
,
Jack?"Curdish
glanced
at
his
arm
,
and
his
features
grew
more
fierce
and
his
eye
more
villainous
,
as
he
replied
:
"
Well
,
yes
,
I
got
a
little
hurt
thar
'
,
in
a
scrimmage
on
his
account
;
but
—
"
and
he
uttered
a
horrible
oath—"I'll
be
even
with
the
rascals
<EOS>
yit
,
or
<EOS>
I
ai
nt
what
I
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
all
I
learn
is
true
,
Curdish
,
you
deserved
what
you
got
,
and
more
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Ronald
,
knitting
his
brows
,
and
eyeing
him
sternly
;
"
but
of
this
another
time
.
<EOS>
Of
what
do
you
accuse
the
Jew
?
<EOS>
Beware
,
now
,
of
your
accusation
!
<EOS>
for
if
false
,
you
know
the
penalty
.
<EOS>
""I
ca
n't
read
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
the
law
runs
,
"
said
Curdish
,
somewhat
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"I
will
inform
you
then
,
"
rejoined
Ronald
;
and
stooping
down
,
he
unlocked
a
small
trap
-
door
in
the
floor
of
the
ptatform
on
which
he
stood
,
took
therefrom
a
parchment
,
turned
to
the
light
,
examined
it
a
moment
,
and
read
as
follows:"Sec

<EOS>
If
any

not
strictly
true

or
which
may
be
proved
to
be
false
,
he
shall
suffer
death
,
as
provided
under
the
Black
Law
,
in
Article
XV
of
Section
<EOS>
I

which
is

"
added
Ronald
,
"
to
be
publicly
shot
by
the
captain
of
the
band
,
and
his
body
thrown
to
wild
beasts
.
<EOS>
You
understand
the
law
on
this
point
now
,
Curdish
,
so
proceed
!
<EOS>
Of
what
do
you
accuse
the
Jew?"Curdish
appeared
somewhat
staggered
at
the
consequences
of
a
false
statement
,
and
his
face
grew
a
shade
paler
,
as
he
replied
:
"
I
'm
not
exactly
ready
to
prove
what
I
's
going
to
say
,
cap'en
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
had
better
not
say
it
,
"
answered
Ronald
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
tell
me
of
your
suspicions
privately
,
and
I
will
take
measures
to
learn
whether
or
no
they
be
well
founded
.
<EOS>
You
may
resume
your
place
;
and
I
trust
,
for
the
future
<EOS>
,
ere
you
offer
to
swear
to
a
thing
,
you
will
at
least
know
yourself
of
what
you
intend
to
swear
,
or
the
terminus
may
not
be
agreeable
.
<EOS>
As
I
said
,
you
may
resume
your
place
and
take
part
in
the
business
of
the
evening
;
after
which
you
will
consider
yourself
under
arrest
,
as
there
are
other
matters
of
which
I
wish
to
question
you!""But
<EOS>
cap'en—""No
more
!
"
said
Ronald
,
sternly
,
waiving
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Curdish
bit
his
lips
and
slowly
retired.—`Gentlemen
,
"
continued
the
captain
,
"
trust
me
,
all
shall
be
properly
looked
to
;
and
if
I
find
a
traitor
among
us"—he
set
his
teeth
close
and
laid
his
hand
upon
a
pistol
in
his
belt—"by
Heaven
,
he
dies
!
<EOS>
But
to
our
business
.
<EOS>
You
will
now
proceed
,
gentlemen
,
to
the
election
of
your
captain
.
<EOS>
Let
each
vote
for
him
he
deems
most
capable
and
worthy
of
holding
the
office
.
<EOS>
Piketon
,
you
will
go
to
each
member
present
and
take
down
the
name
of
his
choice
.
"
<EOS>
Piketon
obeyed
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
to
the
stand
and
said:"Ronald
Bonardi
is
re
-
elected
captain
of
this
band
,
for
the
term
of
five
years
,
without
a
dissenting
vote
.
<EOS>
"
The
announcement
was
followed
by
three
hearty
cheers
,
and
"
Long
live
Ronald
Bonardi!"When
<EOS>
the
noise
had
again
subsided
,
Bonardi
said
:
"
Contrary
to
my
wish
,
gentlemen
,
when
I
came
before
you
this
evening
,
I
find
that
I
have
been
unanimously
chosen
your
leader
for
another
term
.
<EOS>
I
shall
endeavor
to
fulfil
my
duties
faithfully
;
and
,
gentlemen
,
let
me
add
,
strictly
.
<EOS>
I
fear
,
by
some
evidences
which
have
of
late
come
before
me"—and
<EOS>
he
glanced
at
Curdish—"that
<EOS>
I
have
been
heretofore
too
lenient
—
too
negligent
.
<EOS>
I
shall
make
the
future
atone
for
the
past
;
and
whoever
among
you
breaks
a
law
,
though
he
be
my
bosom
friend
,
I
swear
to
you
he
shall
suffer
the
penalty
—
even
though
that
penalty
be
his
death
by
my
hands
!
<EOS>
Let
each
and
all
of
you
bear
this
in
mind
and
seriously
reflect
upon
it
.
<EOS>
""We
,
gentlemen
,
are
outlaws
;
we
war
upon
society
;
but
,
mark
me
,
<EOS>
we
war
only
upon
the
rich
and
avaricious
!
<EOS>
Most
of
us
have
had
causes
for
forsaking
that
society
,
those
laws
which
govern
the
mass
.
<EOS>
Those
causes
have
been
various
;
and
yet
,
in
the
end
,
they
almost
invariably
resolve
themselves
into
one
cause
;
which
is
,
that
society
and
its
laws
did
not
protect
,
did
not
do
us
justice
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
we
separate
from
the
mass
,
we
must
have
laws
of
our
own
;
and
by
those
laws
we
must
abide
.
<EOS>
Notwitstanding
we
are
outlaws
,
warring
against
the
nabobs
of
the
world
;
against
those
who
,
had
they
the
power
,
would
trample
us
under
their
feet
;
let
us
not
forget
that
we
are
men
,
and
that
we
have
no
right
to
touch
the
humble
,
the
innocent
,
the
defenceless
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
whatever
we
do
,
let
us
bear
in
mind
that
they
are
exempt
from
our
encroachments
.
<EOS>
But
above
all
,
gentlemen
,
under
no
circumstances
whatever
let
our
hands
be
raised
against
women
!
<EOS>
Let
them
be
sacred
in
our
eyes
!
<EOS>
Let
us
remember
that
what
they
are
,
so
are
,
or
were
,
our
mothers
,
our
sisters
and
,
with
many
of
you
I
can
add
,
our
wives
!
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
ask
this
of
you
as
men
,
as
brothers
,
with
whose
fate
my
own
is
now
linked
!
<EOS>
I
ask
it
of
you
in
formal
declaration
!
<EOS>
I
ask
you
to
swear
it
,
by
rising
to
your
feet
!
"
<EOS>
He
paused
,
and
almost
simultaneously
the
assemblage
arose
.
<EOS>
Some
few
were
rather
tardy
—
among
whom
was
Curdish
—
but
all
finally
stood
upon
their
feet
.
<EOS>
"Be
seated
,
gentlemen
,
"
resumed
Ronald
;
"
it
is
enough
;
you
have
all
sworn
,
and
it
is
now
become
a
law
;
and
a
law
let
him
break
who
dares!—for
by
all
I
hold
<EOS>
sacred
<EOS>
,
I
swear
to
you
,
whoever
shall
dare
to
violate
it
,
I
will
slay
,
so
help
me
God
!
"
<EOS>
—
and
his
close
shut
teeth
,
his
compressed
lips
and
flashing
eyes
,
as
he
gazed
on
his
audience
,
told
them
it
was
no
idle
threat
.
<EOS>
"As
I
find
,
gentlemen
,
"
continued
he
,
"
in
tending
to
my
various
business
affairs
,
that
I
require
some
one
to
fill
my
place
when
absent
,
I
have
concluded
to
appoint
me
a
lieutenant
,
whom
you
will
all
respect
and
obey
as
myself
.
<EOS>
He
is
one
well
known
among
you
,
well
tried
and
proved
to
be
worthy
of
the
responsible
office
,
and
I
trust
you
will
approve
my
choice
.
<EOS>
Piketon
,
"
added
he
,
turning
to
that
individual
,
"
henceforth
you
are
second
in
command
;
let
your
duty
be
done
faithfully!"A
prolonged
cheer
of
satisfaction
responded
to
this
announcement
.
<EOS>
Piketon
,
much
embarrassed
,
was
about
to
reply
,
but
Ronald
stopped
him
with:"Nay
,
no
remarks
;
"
and
approaching
,
he
put
upon
his
finger
a
ring
,
adding
:
"
This
,
Piketon
,
is
your
badge
of
office
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
you
will
all
remember
it
,
there
is
but
one
other
like
it
,
and
you
will
all
respect
either
whenever
seen
.
<EOS>
"
Turning
to
Piketon
,
in
a
low
voice
not
heard
by
the
others
,
he
continued
:
"
You
will
order
Garrish
,
Riley
and
David
under
arrest
,
to
meet
here
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
If
they
dispute
your
authority
,
show
them
the
ring
.
<EOS>
If
they
refuse
then
to
comply
,
make
their
lives
the
penalty
!
<EOS>
If
you
choose
,
take
with
you
some
trusty
followers
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
orders
,
captain
,
shall
be
obeyed
to
the
letter
,
"
returned
the
lieutenant
,
respectfully
.
<EOS>
Ronald
again
turned
to
the
audience
.
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
the
attack
we
have
of
late
been
planning
on
the
Tennessee
planter
,
I
shall
not
touch
upon
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
advantageous
and
it
may
not
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
more
upon
it
,
and
mayhap
something
better
will
take
its
place
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
other
business
before
the
meeting?"Piketon
whispered
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
true
,
true
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
I
had
forgotten
;
where
is
he?""He
waits
in
a
boat
on
the
creek
,
"
answered
Piketon
.
<EOS>
"Gentlemen
<EOS>
,
John
Webber
wishes
to
become
a
member
of
our
fraternity
.
<EOS>
You
know
him
,
some
of
you
have
tried
him
,
<EOS>
know
you
ought
why
we
should
not
admit
him?""We
<EOS>
do
not
,
"
answered
several
voices
.
"Enough
!
<EOS>
Moorehead
,
give
Farrar
the
signal
to
admit
Webber!"The
sentinel
within
made
a
low
peculiar
whistle
,
which
was
answered
from
without
,
and
directly
a
figure
stood
in
the
entrance
,
gave
the
pass
and
countersign
,
and
descended
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
wet
,
for
it
still
continued
raining
;
and
as
he
came
forward
,
the
torches
threw
their
lurid
glare
upon
features
which
a
close
observer
might
have
seen
were
pale
from
excitement
.
<EOS>
Piketon
stepped
forward
and
conducted
him
to
the
stand
.
<EOS>
Bonardi
addressed
him:"Webber
,
I
understand
you
wish
to
join
our
fraternity
.
<EOS>
You
of
course
are
not
ignorant
that
in
doing
so
you
are
joining
a
band
outlawed
by
society
;
that
in
doing
so
you
become
an
outlaw
also
,
and
place
yourself
in
a
position
not
envied
by
those
who
have
received
from
society
proper
treatment
.
<EOS>
What
object
may
have
induced
you
to
this
step
,
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
enquire
;
enough
that
you
have
desired
to
take
it
,
knowing
that
you
are
becoming
a
brother
with
those
whose
deeds
by
the
world
are
considered
crimes
—
crimes
too
,
which
are
punished
with
imprisonment
and
sometimes
death
.
<EOS>
You
are
doubtless
aware
also
,
that
in
joining
us
you
are
binding
yourself
to
us
in
a
manner
that
makes
your
life
no
longer
your
own
,
but
a
property
of
the
whole
;
ready
to
be
sacrificed
in
defence
of
the
whole
,
should
necessity
require
it
,
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
As
you
are
bound
to
us
,
so
are
we
bound
to
you
;
and
if
in
difficulty
,
we
are
bound
as
a
body
,
if
possible
,
to
rescue
you
,
even
at
the
peril
of
our
own
lives
.
<EOS>
In
joining
us
you
become
a
partner
in
all
our
spoils
,
in
all
our
dangers
,
in
all
our
triumphs
,
in
all
our
troubles
.
<EOS>
These
matters
of
course
you
understand?"Webber
bowed
.
<EOS>
"It
now
only
remains
,
then
,
for
me
to
administer
the
oath
.
<EOS>
You
will
please
hold
up
your
right
hand!"Webber
complied
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
this
token
of
assent
,
you
,
John
Webber
,
in
the
presence
of
Almighty
God
,
and
these
witnesses
,
solemnly
swear
that
you
will
devote
your
life
to
us
and
our
cause
,
so
long
as
we
remain
a
band
;
that
you
will
abide
by
all
our
laws
,
stand
ready
to
uphold
them
under
all
difficulties
,
under
all
circumstances
whatever
;
in
failure
whereof
,
you
ardently
pray
us
to
take
your
life
as
a
sacrifice
,
and
the
Author
of
your
being
to
condemn
you
to
eternal
torments
forever
and
ever!—in
further
confirmation
of
which
,
you
will
kneel
,
repeat
this
oath
and
sign
our
constitution
.
<EOS>
"These
<EOS>
requisitions
being
complied
with
<EOS>
,
Ronald
continued
:
"
You
are
now
a
brother
;
"
and
after
a
pause
,
added
emphatically
:
"
Forget
not
your
oath
!
<EOS>
Piketon
,
you
will
read
our
laws
and
bylaws
,
that
he
may
not
plead
ignorance
<EOS>
should
he
transgress
,
which
I
pray
God
he
may
not
do
!
<EOS>
for
I
have
sworn
to
inflict
the
penalty
set
to
each
law
,
on
him
who
breaks
it
;
and
I
now
again
swear
that
I
will
keep
my
oath!—and
,
Piketon
<EOS>
,
you
will
add
the
law
of
this
evening
,
regarding
women
,
the
innocent
and
defenceless
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
this
had
been
gone
through
with
—
occupying
some
half
hour
more
—
Ronald
said
:
"
Gentlemen
,
for
your
attention
this
evening
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
Our
business
is
now
closed
.
<EOS>
What
,
ho
!
<EOS>
Cyntha!—the
wine
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
the
slave
came
forth
from
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
,
he
added
:
"
Gentlemen
,
make
yourselves
happy
;
there
is
wine
,
and
cards
for
those
who
wish
to
play
;
but
I
pray
you
be
as
quiet
as
possible
,
and
no
quarreling
!
—
<EOS>
When
through
with
your
pastime
,
return
peaceably
to
your
homes
,
and
when
anything
of
importance
occurs
you
shall
be
duly
warned
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
retire
.
<EOS>
Piketon
,
you
will
preside
in
my
place
;
"
and
with
a
graceful
bow
,
Ronald
entered
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
and
joined
his
own
beloved
Inez
,
who
was
sitting
expectant
.
<EOS>
All
passed
off
quietly
,
and
ere
daylight
<EOS>
most
of
the
party
were
on
their
way
to
their
several
places
of
abode
,
which
were
scattered
throughout
the
adjoining
country
—
many
of
them
being
regular
settlers
.
<EOS>
Some
few
,
however
,
remained
—
having
partaken
rather
too
freely
of
the
wine
;
but
with
the
exception
of
Curdish
and
four
others
retained
as
sentinels
,
all
departed
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
III.THE
CRISIS
OF
THE
INVALID
—
<EOS>
THE
STROLL
—
THE
MEDITATION
—
THE
LANDSCAPE
—
THE
VILLAIN
—
<EOS>
THE
TERRIBLE
<EOS>
THREAT.It
may
be
said
and
with
truth
,
that
the
heart
in
a
great
measure
governs
the
vision
,
and
gives
to
objects
coming
before
the
eye
their
light
and
dark
phases
.
<EOS>
But
few
stop
to
reason
and
realize
how
much
this
is
the
case
in
our
every
day
life
.
<EOS>
One
day
every
thing
we
behold
is
bright
and
joyous
,
another
day
dark
and
gloomy,—and
<EOS>
yet
the
same
heavens
are
above
us
,
the
same
earth
at
our
feet
,
the
same
sounds
of
tuneful
nature
around
us
.
<EOS>
—
One
day
every
person
we
meet
wears
a
cheerful
smile
,
another
day
all
seem
to
frown
;
and
we
are
apt
to
think
,
like
the
man
,
who
,
becoming
intoxicated
,
regretted
that
all
his
friends
were
so
,
and
wondered
much
the
very
trees
should
keep
them
company
,
while
he
walked
perfectly
sober
;
we
are
apt
,
we
say
,
to
think
all
others
at
fault
,
when
in
fact
the
whole
change
lies
with
ourself
,
and
the
discord
arises
from
our
own
heart
-
strings
being
out
of
tune
.
<EOS>
The
transition
from
gloom
to
joy
is
oftentimes
rapid
;
and
when
so
,
always
exhilerating
.
<EOS>
It
gives
elasticity
to
all
our
movements
,
and
we
feel
running
through
our
whole
being
a
thrill
of
indiscribable
pleasure
,
almost
amounting
to
intoxication
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
feelings
pervading
the
different
members
,
now
constituting
the
family
of
Webber
,
some
ten
days
from
the
preceding
events
.
<EOS>
—
The
day
was
beautiful
;
one
of
those
that
ever
seem
to
harmonize
best
with
the
upreaching
poetry
of
a
rejoicing
heart
.
<EOS>
One
of
those
days
that
seem
to
let
Heaven
down
a
little
nearer
to
us
—
making
us
feel
as
though
we
could
love
every
thing
we
see
,
rejoice
in
every
sound
we
hear
.
<EOS>
—
The
sun
rose
in
splendor
and
poured
his
bright
beams
through
a
deep
blue
sky
,
where
not
a
cloud
floated
to
intercept
his
rays
even
for
a
moment
,
like
a
young
heart
free
from
the
cloud
-
spots
of
a
yet
untried
world
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
soft
,
and
as
it
gently
floated
along
,
stirring
the
leaves
and
kissing
the
flowers
,
it
stole
the
perfume
of
the
latter
and
bore
it
on
to
refresh
all
who
should
inhale
it
.
<EOS>
The
little
birds
had
not
forgotten
it
was
a
joyous
day
,
and
their
sweet
songs
went
up
in
gentle
chorus
to
their
Maker
,
filling
the
air
with
melody
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
In
the
cottage
of
Webber
we
have
said
there
was
cheerfulness
on
every
countenance
.
<EOS>
Each
moved
with
an
elastic
step
and
bounding
heart
,
and
each
in
their
own
way
felt
happy
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
we
never
experience
happiness
equal
to
that
which
succeeds
a
time
of
gloom
and
desponcy
;
and
the
reader
will
remember
we
left
the
family
of
Webber
in
gloom
,
caused
by
the
sudden
illness
of
one
beloved
by
all
.
<EOS>
It
is
natural
to
infer
then
,
that
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
feelings
of
all
,
sprung
from
the
change
for
the
better
which
had
taken
place
in
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
For
nine
days
Rufus
had
lain
in
a
state
so
critical
that
life
and
death
might
be
said
to
be
in
an
equal
contest
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
Night
and
day
a
watcher
had
stood
by
his
bedside
,
fearful
to
turn
away
for
a
moment
,
lest
the
slightest
negligence
should
prove
fatal
.
<EOS>
For
several
days
and
nights
his
mother
never
quitted
his
side
—
watching
him
with
all
the
deep
anguish
a
mother
's
heart
can
feel
for
one
she
loves
,
when
beholding
that
one
racked
by
pains
she
would
give
her
own
life
to
alleviate
—
and
then
leaving
only
because
worn
out
nature
forced
her
to
repose
.
<EOS>
—
But
her
place
had
been
supplied
by
one
,
who
,
if
she
did
not
love
him
so
deeply
,
at
least
loved
him
with
a
tender
sister
's
love
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
the
noble
hearted
,
gentle
Emily
Nevance
had
stood
by
his
side
,
like
some
angel
of
the
Spirit
Land
awaiting
to
bear
him
to
the
abode
of
the
blest
;
and
what
is
strange
too
,
he
had
ever
seemed
more
at
ease
,
had
ever
remained
more
quiet
when
she
was
present
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
at
times
wild
and
delirious
,
and
for
hours
would
rave
incoherently
when
she
was
absent
,
occasionally
uttering
a
detached
sentence
so
as
to
be
understood
:
"
God
,
it
is
my
doom
!
<EOS>
Emily
—
never
more
:
'
Tis
past
—
tis
past!"—from
<EOS>
which
those
who
heard
him
could
glean
nothing
,
save
that
there
was
some
deep
trouble
on
his
mind
,
<EOS>
some
inward
working
<EOS>
they
could
not
fathom,—but
strange
<EOS>
,
we
say
,
it
was
,
that
when
Emily
was
present
,
although
he
did
not
seem
to
recognise
her
,
he
ever
remained
quiet
;
and
sometimes
a
wan
smile
would
steal
over
his
pale
,
thin
features
,
like
a
faint
ray
of
sunlight
lingering
upon
some
decaying
structure
.
<EOS>
What
was
there
in
her
presence
that
could
so
effect
the
invalid
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
her
gentle
spirit
had
action
upon
his?—that
<EOS>
there
was
a
secret
communion
,
unknown
to
either
,
between
them
?
<EOS>
It
had
been
noticed
by
Emily
,
had
been
noticed
by
others
,
and
had
been
commented
on
by
the
different
members
of
the
household
—
among
whom
we
must
reckon
our
former
acquaintances
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
,
who
still
remained
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
noticed
too
by
the
physician
;
but
noticed
only
as
a
fact
he
could
not
account
for
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
cause
for
it
undoubtedly
;
and
perhaps
one
,
the
father
of
the
sick
one
,
had
vaguely
divined
that
cause
;
but
if
so
,
he
told
it
not
,
and
with
the
rest
,
even
with
Emily
herself
,
it
yet
remained
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
The
evening
previous
to
the
opening
of
this
chapter
had
been
an
eventful
one
.
<EOS>
Nine
days
of
anxiety
had
passed
wearily
away
,
when
the
physician
foresaw
that
a
crisis
was
at
hand
which
must
terminate
in
life
or
death
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
as
before
stated
,
marked
the
effect
of
Emily
's
presence
on
the
invalid
,
and
consequently
gave
orders
that
in
this
trial
none
should
be
present
but
herself
—
no
,
not
even
the
mother
.
<EOS>
The
order
had
been
obeyed
;
but
oh
!
who
can
tell
that
mother
's
feelings
,
when
she
knew
that
a
few
hours
must
decide
the
fate
of
her
darling
child
—
perhaps
to
terminate
in
death
—
and
she
not
be
with
him
to
gaze
upon
his
treasured
features
,
nor
press
her
lips
again
to
his
in
life
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
years
of
agony
were
in
those
few
hours
of
suspense!On
the
evening
in
question
then,—the
ninth
from
his
attack
—
Emily
took
her
position
,
alone
,
by
the
side
of
Rufus
,
and
watched
him
with
painful
feelings
.
<EOS>
He
had
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
,
a
sleep
almost
like
death
itself
,
for
scarcely
was
his
breathing
perceptible
.
<EOS>
She
knew
from
that
sleep
he
would
never
wake
,
or
wake
to
life
free
from
danger
.
<EOS>
All
was
silent
,
as
though
death
were
already
there
.
<EOS>
A
dim
light
,
standing
some
distance
back
,
gave
a
twilight
shade
to
the
whole
apartment
;
and
she
could
barely
discern
the
outline
of
his
pale
,
marble
-
like
features
,
which
she
sometimes
fancied
were
already
stiffening
in
death
.
<EOS>
As
she
occasionally
gazed
upon
him
,
an
indescribable
awe
crept
over
her
.
<EOS>
Was
he
dead
—
had
his
bright
spirit
gone
forever
?
<EOS>
she
would
sometimes
question
herself
;
and
then
the
thought
,
if
such
was
the
case
,
what
agony
would
be
hers
to
witness
in
beholding
the
anguish
of
his
mother
,
—
who
with
the
rest
of
the
occupants
were
waiting
in
gloomy
silence
the
signal
from
her
to
weep
or
rejoice
—
made
her
feel
more
gloomy
and
depressed
.
<EOS>
Thus
passed
two
hours
—
two
long
trying
hours
—
and
yet
no
change
;
the
sufferer
had
moved
not
,
and
she
began
to
fancy
his
spirit
had
passed
quietly
away
.
<EOS>
With
a
trembling
hand
she
raised
the
light
,
approached
,
and
held
it
near
his
features
.
<EOS>
—
All
was
calm
—
he
did
not
seem
to
breathe
.
<EOS>
She
bent
down
her
head
,
but
could
hear
no
sound
indicating
life
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
gone
,
"
she
thought
,
and
tears
of
anguish
filled
her
eyes
;
and
as
she
raised
her
head
,
a
drop
fell
on
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
of
itself
,
and
yet
,
as
it
had
been
the
Promethean
spark
,
the
invalid
started
,
drew
a
long
breath
,
opened
his
eyes
,
fixing
them
intently
upon
Emily
,
who
stood
perfectly
motionless
,
fearful
lest
in
his
weak
state
<EOS>
a
sudden
move
might
prove
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
gazed
upon
her
with
a
sign
of
recognition
in
his
intelligent
features
,
and
then
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
as
one
assuring
himself
whether
he
be
dreaming
or
not
.
<EOS>
Again
he
gazed
upon
her
intently
,
and
a
bright
flush
mounted
his
cheek
,
as
he
said:"Emily
,
is
it
you
,
or
a
spirit
I
behold?""Thank
God
,
he
is
safe
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Emily
,
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
upward
,
while
tears
of
joy
stole
down
her
sweet
features
;
and
bending
over
,
she
pressed
her
lips
to
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
"O
,
Emily
,
is
this
reality
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Rufus
,
with
a
thrill
of
joy
lighting
up
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
—
"
O
say
it
is
not
a
dream!""It
<EOS>
is
no
dream
,
Rufus
,
"
said
she
,
looking
tenderly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
have
been
dreaming
,
"
returned
he
,
gazing
slowly
around
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
slept
long
,
and
yet
it
is
still
dark
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
coming
into
this
room
.
<EOS>
How
came
I
here
,
and
why
were
you
watching
me?""You
have
been
ill
,
Rufus
,
very
ill
.
<EOS>
For
nine
days
you
have
stood
on
the
verge
of
the
grave!""Ill
—
nine
days
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
he
,
looking
incredulously
,
and
placing
his
hand
to
his
head
,
as
though
to
collect
his
thoughts
:
"
I
do
feel
weak
.
<EOS>
"
As
he
took
his
hand
down
,
it
caught
his
eye
,
and
starting
at
the
sight
of
its
thin
,
bony
appearance
,
he
murmured
:
"
I
have
indeed
been
ill
.
<EOS>
But
where
was
I
taken
,
Emily
?
<EOS>
I
remember
nothing
.
<EOS>
""At
<EOS>
the
door
here
,
just
as
you
had
returned
from
a
search
for
me
.
<EOS>
""Search
<EOS>
for
you
,
Emily
!
"
repeated
he
,
earnestly
,
partly
raising
himself
in
bed—"a
search
for
you
!
<EOS>
Then
it
was
no
dream
,
Emily
,
it
was
no
dream
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
added
he
,
pressing
one
hand
to
his
forehead
,
while
a
look
of
mental
anguish
hovered
on
his
features
:
"
I
—
I
remember
now
,
it
was
no
dream
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
that
it
were
anything
but
reality
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Emily
—
"
he
paused
and
fell
back
on
the
pillow
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
Rufus
,
what
means
this
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Emily
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"I
must
not
tell
you
—
it
was
nothing
—
it
is
over
now
,
"
he
replied
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
had
fears
for
me
<EOS>
,
you
perceive
I
have
safely
returned
,
"
said
she
,
soothingly
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
with
another
!
"
added
he
emphatically
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
thought
flashed
across
her
brain
,
but
instantly
discarding
it
,
she
rejoined
:
"
<EOS>
True
,
with
another
;
but
why
should
that
trouble
you
,
Rufus
?
<EOS>
I
was
with
a
friend
,
whom
you
know
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
I
went
forth
with
Edward
Merton
and
returned
with
him
.
<EOS>
What
see
you
wrong
in
that
,
Rufus?"Ero
he
could
reply
,
the
door
opened
and
his
mother
softly
entered
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
voices
in
conversation
—
his
voice
—
and
her
heart
would
let
her
wait
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"O
,
mother
,
dear
mother
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rufus
,
as
he
saw
her
approaching
.
<EOS>
"God
of
mercy!—he
lives
!
<EOS>
he
lives
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
she
;
and
rushing
forward
,
she
clasped
him
to
her
bosom
,
raised
her
eyes
to
Heaven
,
and
poured
out
her
heart
in
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
to
the
Supreme
Ruler
.
<EOS>
Webber
was
next
to
enter
,
and
with
tearful
eyes
he
pressed
his
lips
to
the
pale
cheek
of
Rufus
and
uttered
:
"
God
be
praised
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
physician
followed
Webber
,
accompanied
by
Bernard
and
Tyrone
;
but
all
three
paused
as
they
entered
the
apartment
—
which
we
should
have
mentioned
was
the
same
from
which
Curdish
escaped
—
and
gazed
upon
the
scene
with
heartfelt
emotion
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
dwell
longer
here
;
suffice
,
that
that
night
was
one
of
rejoicing
,
and
the
next
morning
one
,
as
we
have
shown
,
well
calculated
to
add
to
the
joy
of
lightened
hearts
.
<EOS>
Each
rose
refreshed
in
body
and
mind
;
and
the
invalid
,
as
he
gazed
forth
through
the
open
windows
,
heard
the
song
of
birds
,
and
felt
the
soft
air
upon
his
wasted
features
with
a
thrill
of
delight
.
<EOS>
After
paying
Rufus
a
morning
visit
,
and
finding
him
gradually
recovering
,
Emily,—who
on
his
account
had
of
late
closely
confined
herself
to
the
house
—
and
as
the
morning
was
so
fine
too
—
could
not
resist
the
inclination
of
walking
abroad
to
taste
the
fresh
air
,
and
view
nature
in
all
her
loveliness
;
for
she
was
one
whose
soul
was
ever
open
to
such
delights
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
,
she
stole
quietly
away
;
and
taking
a
path
which
led
through
the
farm
of
Webber
to
the
southward
,
she
made
her
way
with
a
light
step
toward
a
gentle
eminence
,
some
half
a
mile
distant
,
which
overlooked
a
beautiful
portion
of
the
country
,
and
where
she
was
wo
nt
to
spend
many
a
pleasant
hour
in
meditating
upon
the
handiwork
of
the
Supreme
Being
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
deep
,
inward
joy
in
her
heart
as
she
tripped
along
the
winding
path
;
now
beside
fields
of
grain
,
struggling
up
as
though
to
regain
what
they
had
lost
by
the
devastating
tornado
;
now
through
tall
,
rank
grass
,
where
occasionally
a
flower
might
be
seen
peeping
forth
,
like
a
modest
maiden
from
her
lattice
bower
;
now
through
bushes
rejoicing
in
beautiful
foliage
,
where
the
little
birds
made
their
nests
and
sung
their
songs:—there
was
deep
,
inward
joy
in
her
heart
,
we
say
,
as
she
tripped
along
;
a
sweet
,
dreamy
sensation
of
delight
,
such
as
she
had
not
felt
before
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
The
mind
of
Emily
was
one
of
those
deep
,
pure
,
earnest
,
sensitive
ones
,
that
in
a
measure
take
their
coloring
from
those
around
them
,
as
the
chameleon
from
the
objects
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
was
fickle
,
vacilating
,
governed
only
by
the
opinions
of
those
whose
words
fell
last
upon
her
ear
:
<EOS>
no
,
by
no
means
;
for
in
this
respect
she
could
be
swayed
only
by
the
best
of
reasoning
;
but
she
was
one
of
those
who
are
full
of
soul
and
feeling
,
and
she
was
acted
upon
by
the
feelings
of
others
.
<EOS>
Naturally
of
buoyant
spirits
,
full
of
vivacity
and
cheerfulness
,
she
delighted
to
see
every
one
around
her
in
the
same
mood
—
every
one
happy
;
and
she
could
not
rejoice
,
could
not
be
gay
,
where
she
knew
another
was
in
grief
,
or
any
way
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
quick
,
energetic
,
but
full
of
sympathy
;
and
the
latter
noble
virtue
was
,
perhaps
,
her
ruling
passion
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
while
she
knew
that
one
of
the
family
with
whom
she
had
been
reared,—to
whom
,
for
their
kindness
,
she
felt
she
owed
such
a
debt
of
gratitude
,
and
one
too
whom
she
loved
with
all
the
earnest
affection
of
a
sister
—
was
lying
in
such
a
critical
state
,
with
death
staring
him
in
the
face
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
feel
happy
—
could
not
remove
the
weight
of
anguish
that
lay
like
lead
upon
her
heart
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
case
was
altered
.
<EOS>
With
his
return
to
reason
and
convalescence
,
returned
her
buoyant
,
joyous
spirits
,
—
rising
just
in
proportion
to
their
long
and
severe
depression
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
day
too
,
above
all
others
,
that
she
loved
,
and
every
thing
seemed
to
conspire
to
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
for
a
time
,
as
we
have
said
,
she
tripped
along
with
a
gay
air
—
gazing
with
delight
upon
the
scene
around
her,—occasionally
stopping
to
pluck
a
flower
that
pleased
her
fancy
,
to
be
woven
into
a
garland
for
the
sick
one
,
with
whom
as
yet
her
gentle
thoughts
were
mostly
occupied
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
her
mind
turned
into
another
channel
—
a
shade
stole
over
her
sweet
features
,
and
her
step
grew
tardy
.
<EOS>
The
cause
was
a
natural
and
simple
one
.
<EOS>
By
one
of
those
sudden
flashes
which
an
active
temperament
is
subject
to
,
the
night
of
the
storm
and
her
capture
rose
up
before
her
;
and
for
a
moment
all
the
wild
feelings
of
that
terrible
time
came
back
with
the
vividness
of
reality
;
and
what
seems
strange
too
,
this
had
never
occurred
before
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
she
had
thought
of
it
at
times
;
but
then
her
thoughts
had
been
vague
and
transitory,—for
grief
was
at
her
heart
for
the
welfare
of
one
she
too
much
esteemed
to
think
of
herself
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
case
was
different
,
—
there
were
no
strong
emotions
to
throw
aside
those
scenes
of
alarm
and
terror
,
and
they
came
back
with
startling
force
.
<EOS>
She
saw
again
the
old
hut
,
where
she
and
Merton
had
remained
during
that
terrific
storm
;
she
saw
the
old
woman
standing
before
her
,
with
her
wild
looks
,
rapid
gesticulations
—
heard
her
prophetic
words
of
warning
,
and
felt
a
kind
of
awe
creeping
over
her
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
her
feelings
too
,
while
going
through
that
lonely
pass
—
her
seizure
by
Riley
,
and
wild
ride
to
the
river
—
her
interview
with
the
old
Jew
—
her
despair
,
when
pinioned
in
the
grasp
of
his
villainous
subordinates
;
and
,
finnally
,
the
sweet
charm
of
her
release
by
the
one
of
all
others
whom
she
loved
.
<EOS>
As
her
train
of
thoughts
led
Emily
to
think
of
Edward
,
she
dwelt
for
a
time
upon
his
noble
,
generous
nature
—
his
winning
ways
,
and
deep
,
ardent
love
for
her
;
love
which
she
felt
—
might
return
—
and
both
be
happy
,
but
for
the
disparity
in
their
positions
as
viewed
by
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
saw
him
an
only
heir
of
a
rich
,
aristocratic
father
,
whom
she
had
every
reason
to
believe
would
oppose
any
other
than
a
wealthy
alliance
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
She
feared
too
,
even
if
consent
were
gained
to
their
union
,
the
opposition
Edward
would
have
to
encounter
,
in
this
respect
,
would
tend
to
weaken
those
ties
of
affection
which
now
bound
him
so
strongly
to
her
,
and
make
him
regret
,
in
secret
at
least
—
for
she
believed
him
of
too
generous
and
noble
a
nature
to
show
it
openly
—
that
he
had
ever
sought
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
one
of
those
intuitive
ones
that
pierce
below
the
polished
surface
and
read
the
human
heart
as
it
is
,
with
its
good
and
bad
parts
commingled
;
and
she
felt
,
however
much
she
might
love
him,—and
<EOS>
love
him
<EOS>
she
certainly
did
—
<EOS>
she
must
,
as
a
duty
to
him
,
in
securing
his
happiness
,
discourage
his
suit
.
<EOS>
As
these
thoughts
came
up
before
her
,
with
all
the
force
of
her
good
sense
of
propriety
,
her
features
grew
sad
,
and
her
head
drooped
with
a
pensive
air
.
<EOS>
And
then
Emily
's
mind
reverted
to
herself
—
her
humble
condition
—
a
dependant
upon
the
charity
of
others
.
<EOS>
Who
was
she
?
<EOS>
She
had
often
heard
Webber
relate
the
story
of
how
she
became
an
inmate
of
his
house
—
a
member
of
his
family
—
and
there
was
a
mystery
about
it
which
troubled
her
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
was
of
low
birth
,
an
offspring
of
guilt
,
and
consequently
no
mate
for
Edward
Merton
,
even
setting
wealth
aside
;
and
this
reflection
but
made
her
feelings
more
sad
and
painful
.
<EOS>
From
this
her
mind
again
returned
to
her
capture
,
and
the
conversation
she
had
overheard
between
Riley
and
the
Jew
,
regarding
herself
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
Riley
's
assertion
that
there
was
some
secret
connected
with
her
birth
,
and
the
answer
of
the
Jew
by
asking
him
how
he
had
found
that
out
;
and
also
Riley
's
remark
that
he
would
make
money
by
marrying
her
,
by
which
a
ray
of
hope
sprung
up
that
she
might
be
of
good
descent
,
perhaps
one
of
a
wealthy
family
.
<EOS>
And
then
her
wonder
how
the
Jew
,
if
such
was
the
case
,
should
know
any
thing
of
this
;
and
if
not
,
why
he
should
wish
to
seize
upon
her
person
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
got
hold
of
proofs
—
some
paper
or
papers
which
would
establish
rights
wrongfully
wrested
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
of
such
things
happening
to
others
—
might
they
not
happen
to
herself
?
<EOS>
And
then
the
mysterious
note
Webber
had
received
some
five
years
ago
,
accompanied
with
money
,
charging
him
to
educate
her
for
any
station
in
society:—what
<EOS>
did
that
mean
?
<EOS>
Was
there
not
some
connection
between
that
and
the
knowledge
possessed
by
the
Jew
?
<EOS>
As
these
thoughts
came
to
her
,
overwhelmed
as
they
were
by
mystery
,
hope
revived
that
some
day
this
mystery
would
be
cleared
up
,
and
she
perhaps
would
then
stand
fair
before
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
then
again
,
how
was
this
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
What
probability
was
there
that
such
,
even
if
her
surmises
were
correct
,
would
ever
take
place
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
admit
to
herself
that
,
at
the
best
,
this
was
but
a
wild
speculation
—
a
vision
of
the
brain
—
a
sort
of
castle
in
the
air
affair
,
without
form
or
substance
;
in
fact
,
but
little
less
than
an
impossibility
;
and
again
all
hope
of
such
a
termination
died
away
,
leaving
her
if
any
thing
more
in
the
dark
,
more
in
gloom
,
for
the
faint
gleam
which
had
for
a
moment
shone
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Thus
musing
to
herself
upon
the
various
matters
recorded
,
Emily
came
to
a
rough
fence
,
which
shut
in
the
field
of
culture
,
and
ran
along
at
the
base
of
the
hill
or
eminence
previously
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
slightest
incident
at
times
is
enough
to
change
the
current
of
our
thoughts
;
and
as
Emily
looked
up
at
this
interruption
to
her
progress
,
and
marked
the
loveliness
of
every
thing
around
,
she
felt
a
sweet
thrill
of
pleasure
steal
through
her
veins
,
and
all
her
gloomy
feelings
emerged
into
an
intellectual
enthusiasm
for
the
beauties
of
nature
.
<EOS>
Crossing
the
fence
,
she
moved
at
a
quickened
pace
up
the
hill
,
whose
brow
was
some
hundred
yards
distant
,
and
there
paused
to
gaze
with
rapture
upon
the
beautiful
landscape
spread
out
before
her
.
<EOS>
The
scene
now
brought
to
her
view
<EOS>
was
indeed
a
delightful
one
,
and
one
worthy
of
a
description
.
<EOS>
The
summit
of
the
hill
itself
was
shaded
by
a
pleasant
grove
of
trees
,
underneath
which
were
several
large
,
flat
rocks
—
forming
to
one
weary
of
walking
various
tempting
seats
for
repose
.
<EOS>
Beside
one
of
these
rocks
was
a
large
old
oak
,
which
,
although
now
fast
verging
to
decay
,
still
bore
on
its
aged
limbs
a
goodly
covering
of
foliage
.
<EOS>
This
,
of
all
others
,
was
Emily
's
fa
vorite
spot
;
and
after
pausing
for
a
moment
,
she
approached
and
sprang
lightly
upon
the
stone
.
<EOS>
From
this
her
range
of
vision
was
somewhat
extended
;
for
being
on
the
farther
line
of
the
hill
from
her
approach
,
she
could
command
a
view
of
its
base
to
the
southward
.
<EOS>
The
hill
,
in
this
direction
,
was
unlike
its
northern
aspect
—
being
more
rough
and
precipitous
,
and
more
densely
shaded
by
a
growth
of
shrubby
trees
;
if
,
in
fact
,
they
might
be
allowed
the
appellation
of
trees
at
all
.
<EOS>
Directly
at
its
base
,
however
,
were
some
of
a
larger
kind
,
which
had
struggled
up
among
rocks
and
bushes
,
like
ambitious
men
to
overlook
their
fellows
.
<EOS>
Rippling
along
at
the
roots
of
these
,
over
a
rough
bed
,
was
the
Maramee
—
a
glimpse
and
sound
of
whose
limpid
waters
could
both
be
seen
and
heard
from
where
Emily
stood
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
of
this
stream
rose
another
hill
to
about
the
same
height
—
being
also
similar
in
appearance
to
the
one
just
described
.
<EOS>
Beyond
this
latter
,
to
the
southward
,
the
land
was
lower
for
a
considerable
distance
,
so
that
the
next
object
which
met
the
eye
was
the
dim
outline
of
a
range
of
mountains
far
away
.
<EOS>
To
the
left
,
or
eastward
,
the
eye
could
follow
the
bed
of
the
river
between
these
hills
for
something
like
a
mile
,
when
the
view
was
again
cut
off
by
a
sudden
turn
in
its
course
—
appearing
to
the
observer
as
though
the
two
ridges
met
and
formed
an
oval
termination
.
<EOS>
From
this
all
trace
of
the
opposite
hill
was
lost
;
but
the
one
on
which
Emily
stood
could
be
seen
making
an
angle
of
some
forty
-
five
degrees
,
and
shooting
off
in
a
serpentine
manner
to
the
northeast
—
forming
,
in
fact
,
the
same
ridge
,
a
part
of
which
we
described
in
the
commencement
of
our
story
.
<EOS>
About
half
way
from
where
Emily
stood
to
the
angle
mentioned
,
was
a
smaller
elevation
,
bearing
a
few
points
west
of
north
,
running
past
Webber
's
cottage
,
some
little
distance
to
the
east
,
and
forming
the
hill
from
which
was
first
descried
the
approach
of
Bernard
and
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
Turning
to
the
west
and
south
,
the
scene
presented
was
by
far
the
most
extended
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
A
few
hundred
yards
to
the
westward
,
the
hills
or
ridges
we
have
been
describing
made
a
handsome
curve
to
the
left
,
leaving
the
vision
free
scope
over
rather
a
level
country
for
a
goodly
number
of
miles
—
now
touching
on
a
strip
of
prairie
,
now
upon
a
dark
,
heavy
wood
—
relieved
here
and
there
by
a
glimpse
of
some
cottage
,
whose
light
blue
smoke
curling
slowly
upward
in
the
morning
sun
gave
a
pleasing
sensation
of
domestic
happiness
,
and
whose
clearings
around
told
that
settlement
and
civilization
were
slowly
creeping
into
the
late
abodes
of
the
savage
and
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
To
the
north
,
passing
over
the
farmer
-
like
appearance
of
Webber
's
fields
of
grain
,
mowing
lots
,
pasture
grounds
—
his
orchard
,
garden
,
dwelling
,
stabling
—
all
of
which
caused
the
eye
to
linger
awhile
,
and
particularly
Emily
's
,
with
a
quiet
sensation
of
pleasure,—passing
over
these
,
we
say
,
in
a
northern
direction
,
some
eight
or
ten
miles
distant
,
the
eye
fell
upon
what
appeared
a
long
narrow
strip
of
silver
;
but
which
a
close
examination
would
have
proved
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
small
portion
of
the
deep
,
dark
,
rapid
,
muddy
Missouri
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
throughout
the
landscape
,
some
smaller
streams
winding
about
here
and
there
,
appearing
like
silver
threads
thrown
carelessly
upon
a
carpet
,
added
their
little
to
the
perfection
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
Such
,
reader
,
is
but
an
imperfect
sketch
of
the
country
in
the
vicinity
of
Emily
's
new
home
,
and
the
scene
which
she
now
gazed
upon
with
feelings
known
only
to
the
lovers
of
nature
and
the
beautiful
.
<EOS>
If
we
have
failed
in
attempting
to
bring
to
the
view
of
the
reader
a
picture
of
what
Emily
saw
—
and
we
feel
we
have
—
for
what
is
description
after
all
,
but
description
;
and
how
far
short
it
falls
of
the
reality
—
of
those
thousand
little
things
which
in
themselves
are
nothing
,
but
which
are
needful
in
making
up
the
whole,—if
we
have
failed
,
we
say
,
in
describing
what
she
saw
,
we
utterly
despair
of
giving
the
sounds
she
heard
—
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
,
the
murmur
of
the
streamlet
,
the
humming
of
the
insects
,
the
singing
of
the
birds
,
the
ten
thousand
,
in
fact
,
indescribable
voices
by
which
nature
completes
her
inimitable
song
of
harmony
.
<EOS>
But
let
these
pass
;
suffice
that
she
saw
and
heard
enough
to
hold
her
too
much
enraptured
to
notice
the
approach
of
another
—
a
tall
dark
figure
—
who
,
finding
her
attention
so
much
occupied
,
came
to
a
pause
a
few
feet
distant
,
and
deliberately
folding
his
arms
on
his
breast
,
stood
for
some
moments
regarding
her
in
silence
,
but
evidently
with
no
ordinary
feelings
.
<EOS>
We
have
said
he
was
a
tall
dark
figure
;
but
in
the
latter
adjective
,
dark
,
we
have
reference
only
to
his
complexion
and
the
expression
of
his
features
,
which
were
of
a
sinister
cast
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
black
,
but
of
that
peculiar
black
which
is
most
repulsive
,
and
were
shaded
by
thick
,
overhanging
brows
,
that
gave
them
at
all
times
a
look
of
sullen
fierceness
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
further
remarkable
in
his
countenance
,
unless
a
few
singularly
drawn
lines
near
his
mouth
,
indicative
of
a
determination
to
carry
out
whatever
design
he
might
attempt
,
and
a
peculiar
smile
,
sometimes
seen
,
but
a
smile
so
devilish
that
those
who
saw
never
forgot
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
young
,
or
at
least
exceeded
not
twenty
-
four
years
,
and
in
person
well
and
even
handsomely
formed
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
rather
careless
,
consisting
of
coarse
pantaloons
fastened
around
the
waist
by
a
leather
belt
—
a
coarse
shirt
,
open
about
the
neck
—
a
sailor
-
like
jacket
—
a
light
straw
hat
and
heavy
boots
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
he
stood
regarding
Emily
with
a
strange
look
—
the
look
of
one
who
had
resolved
upon
a
certain
result
,
yet
was
almost
undetermined
how
to
proceed
,
should
all
not
succeed
to
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
a
look
of
tenderness
mingled
with
a
heavy
frown
,
as
though
nature
had
roused
to
combat
two
opposite
passions
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Emily
stood
gazing
upon
the
landscape
with
a
bright
eye
and
pleasing
smile
;
but
whether
her
thoughts
were
now
on
what
she
saw
,
or
appeared
to
see
,
or
whether
they
had
wandered
away
to
the
one
she
loved
,
we
shall
not
stop
to
analyze
;
though
we
might
,
perhaps
,
true
to
nature
,
premise
the
latter
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
started
,
as
by
some
sudden
thought
,
and
turning
a
little
,
started
again
on
beholding
the
person
we
have
described
.
<EOS>
There
seemed
a
sort
of
revulsion
at
once
in
her
feelings
;
for
the
blood
in
her
cheeks
returned
to
her
heart
,
leaving
them
pale
,
as
though
a
presentiment
of
trouble
had
came
over
her
,
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
trembled
.
<EOS>
This
was
but
momentary
however
,
for
the
next
instant
she
was
calm
;
and
as
if
half
ashamed
of
thus
betraying
herself
,
and
the
more
perfectly
to
regain
her
composure
,
or
secrete
her
real
thoughts
,
she
said
with
laugh:"Well
<EOS>
,
I
declare
,
John
,
I
hope
you
are
more
successful
with
the
ladies
generally
,
on
your
first
appearance
,
for
I
must
own
you
frightened
me
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
was
something
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
and
manner
of
speaking
,
notwithstanding
her
laugh
and
familiar
language
,
that
appeared
forced
and
unnatural
,
which
John
Webber
—
for
such
the
reader
has
doubtless
divined
him
to
be
—
noticed
.
<EOS>
He
had
noticed
too
her
sudden
start
when
she
first
beheld
him
—
her
paleness
—
her
tremulous
agitation
—
in
fact
,
nothing
had
escaped
him
;
but
he
had
attributed
to
all
these
a
very
different
cause
from
the
real
one
,
and
he
answered
accordingly:"I
did
not
intend
to
frighten
you
,
Emily
;
though
I
presume
a
pleasant
surprise
is
not
in
the
end
a
disagreeable
fright?""True
,
it
is
not
,
"
answered
Emily
,
who
felt
relieved
that
he
had
not
seen
her
repugnance
to
him
;
for
it
was
against
her
gentle
disposition
to
wound
the
feelings
of
any
;
and
although
there
ever
had
been
in
his
nature
something
dark
and
uncongenial
with
her
own
,
a
something
to
make
her
feel
reserved
and
oppressed
in
his
presence
,
yet
she
had
never
forgotten
he
was
the
son
of
her
benefactor
,
and
had
always
striven
to
keep
her
feelings
under
,
to
appear
if
anything
more
happy
than
usual
that
he
might
not
detect
it
.
<EOS>
In
this
she
had
over
acted
,
as
is
sometimes
the
case
;
or
rather
,
we
might
say
,
overreached
herself
;
for
had
she
shown
more
of
her
real
feelings
<EOS>
,
it
had
doubtless
been
better
for
her
in
the
end
—
had
saved
her
many
a
bitter
pang
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
to
make
him
think
her
not
displeased
in
his
company
,
she
had
,
without
intending
it
,
forced
him
to
think
his
company
more
agreeable
to
her
than
others
.
<EOS>
Perfectly
reckless
in
all
moral
principles
,
careless
about
searching
for
cause
,
he
stopped
at
effect
,
and
looked
upon
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Without
any
distinct
notions
of
love
,
congeniality
of
soul
,
and
the
like
,
he
had
formed
a
resolve
in
his
own
mind
that
Emily
some
day
should
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
A
resolve
with
him
was
almost
the
same
thing
as
a
certainty
,
for
he
never
counted
on
a
failure
;
and
having
once
set
it
down
as
a
fact
,
he
rarely
ever
thought
again
upon
it
,
until
the
time
came
round
for
its
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
The
resolve
concerning
Emily
he
had
made
some
three
months
after
her
arrival
from
New
York
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
and
appearance
had
struck
him
then
as
belonging
to
no
ordinary
person
,
and
from
thinking
of
this
a
fancy
had
sprung
up
that
she
would
suit
him
better
than
any
woman
he
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
This
with
him
was
enough
;
and
without
intimating
it
to
her
,
or
ascertaining
her
feelings
on
the
subject
,
he
had
dropped
it
,
with
the
idea
that
all
was
settled
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Had
he
been
of
a
different
temperament
,
he
would
doubtless
have
felt
uneasy
at
the
attentions
which
he
could
not
avoid
seeing
were
paid
her
by
Merton
,
and
her
apparent
pleasure
while
in
his
company
.
<EOS>
But
this
with
him
was
a
matter
of
course
affair
,
and
he
never
gave
it
a
thought
;
or
,
if
he
did
,
it
was
only
to
smile
to
himself
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
to
use
an
old
proverb
,
"
you
are
reckoning
without
your
host
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Another
than
him
,
too
,
would
have
felt
indignant
at
her
capture
,
and
would
have
revenged
himself
perhaps
on
the
actors
in
that
scene
;
but
he
never
suffered
a
word
to
escape
him
concerning
it
.
<EOS>
True
,
he
did
not
know
of
it
till
after
her
release
—
having
been
out
that
evening
,
as
was
customary
with
him
,
till
somewhat
late
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
he
had
found
the
family
up
in
a
state
of
agitation
,
occasioned
by
the
events
which
had
happened
,
and
the
sickness
of
his
brother
Rufus
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
the
whole
apparently
unmoved
;
and
learning
that
Curdish
was
a
prisoner
,
and
knowing
that
he
belonged
to
the
banditti
,
had
watched
his
opportunity
and
set
him
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
done
for
any
love
he
bore
Curdish
,
but
merely
for
a
selfish
motive
,
by
which
alone
he
was
governed
.
<EOS>
To
gratify
self
,
or
to
get
revenge
,
which
is
only
another
species
of
self
,
he
would
go
to
any
extreme
,
do
any
act
however
devilish
.
<EOS>
Some
months
previous
to
this
event
,
he
had
come
in
contact
with
several
rough
spirits
like
himself
,
and
by
an
intuitive
faculty
and
close
observation
,
had
divined
that
they
were
a
part
of
a
regular
organised
band
;
and
so
expressed
himself
to
them
,
accompanied
by
a
request
to
admit
him
as
a
member
.
<EOS>
This
they
would
not
do
without
putting
him
to
the
proof
;
and
consequently
his
liberation
of
Curdish
,
knowing
him
to
be
one
of
the
band
,
was
only
another
of
the
many
good
services
he
had
done
them
.
<EOS>
Such
is
but
an
imperfect
insight
into
the
character
and
motives
governing
him
who
now
stood
before
Emily
Nevance
;
and
although
we
may
have
digressed
somewhat
in
imparting
this
information
,
yet
as
he
is
destined
to
bear
a
conspicuous
part
in
our
story
,
we
felt
it
to
be
a
matter
with
which
the
reader
should
at
once
be
made
acquainted
.
<EOS>
With
John
Webber
the
time
had
now
come
wherein
he
had
resolved
to
communicate
to
Emily
his
design
of
making
her
his
partner
for
life
.
<EOS>
—
For
some
days
he
had
been
absent
from
home
,
and
was
even
that
very
morning
returning
,
pondering
this
in
his
mind
,
and
how
best
to
proceed
,
<EOS>
when
on
looking
up
he
was
both
surprised
and
rejoiced
to
behold
the
object
of
his
musings
before
him
.
<EOS>
This
was
only
so
much
in
his
favor
,
he
thought
,
and
too
good
an
opportunity
to
pass
unimproved
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
approached
,
as
we
have
shown
,
and
stood
for
some
time
regarding
her
in
silence
,
with
very
curious
feelings
.
<EOS>
—
Her
surprise
and
agitation
on
seeing
him
he
attributed
to
the
deep
interest
she
took
in
his
welfare
;
or
what
in
another
,
who
could
have
better
comprehended
the
meaning
of
the
word
,
would
have
been
termed
love
;
hence
the
answer
he
made
in
reply
to
her
remark
.
<EOS>
But
to
resume
the
conversation
from
which
we
have
digressed
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
after
Emily
spoke
,
there
was
a
silence
,
and
feeling
unless
something
was
said
it
would
become
very
embarrassing
,
and
resolving
to
change
the
subject
,
she
resumed:"But
you
seem
to
absent
yourself
from
us
lately
,
John
;
I
have
not
seen
you
for
some
days
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
Emily
,
for
some
days
I
have
been
absent
,
"
replied
he
,
still
drawing
from
this
remark
a
favorable
augury
to
the
success
of
his
design
.
<EOS>
"Good
news
at
home
—
<EOS>
have
you
learned
it?""No
<EOS>
,
I
was
but
<EOS>
now
on
my
way
there
.
<EOS>
Is
Rufus
dead?""Dead
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Emily
,
with
a
start
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
would
not
call
that
good
news
,
John?""I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
answered
he
,
coloring
at
the
manner
in
which
he
was
betraying
himself
;
"
perhaps
I
did
not
understand
you
.
<EOS>
Did
you
say
good
news?""I
did
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
Rufus
is
free
from
danger
and
recovering
rapidly
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
yes
,
"
returned
he
,
in
a
careless
tone
;
certainly
—
yes
—
free
from
danger
—
yes
—
that
is
good
news
.
<EOS>
"Emily
<EOS>
,
notwitstanding
she
knew
him
to
be
a
man
of
self
,
was
both
surprised
and
shocked
at
this
unnatural
tone
of
indifference
at
the
welfare
of
an
only
brother
;
but
by
a
mighty
effort
she
managed
to
prevent
her
feelings
from
making
themselves
manifest
,
and
continued:"Yes
,
the
crisis
in
his
fever
come
last
night
,
and
thank
God
,
he
lives
!
<EOS>
By
the
orders
of
the
physician
I
stood
by
his
side
and
had
the
joy
of
seeing
him
return
again
to
life
,
almost
as
one
from
the
dead
.
<EOS>
""Joy
,
Emily
,
"
replied
John
,
with
one
of
his
devilish
smiles
,
that
made
her
involuntarily
shudder
;
"
was
it
then
such
joy
to
see
him
return
to
life
,
as
you
say?""Why
,
<EOS>
John
,
what
mean
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
with
such
remarks!""Do
I
?
"
said
John
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"Indeed
you
do
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
with
warmth
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
such
expressions!""O
,
as
to
that
,
"
he
returned
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
"
it
was
merely
a
question,—that
is
all
—
let
it
pass!""But
it
was
an
unnatural
question
,
"
rejoined
Emily
,
with
a
flushed
cheek
;
"
and
one
I
am
surprised
to
hear
one
brother
ask
concerning
another!""Well
!
"
<EOS>
returned
John
,
with
emphasis
,
contracting
his
brows
and
speaking
through
his
teeth
,
<EOS>
"
I
say
let
it
pass
!
<EOS>
I
might
have
my
reasons
for
asking
it
,
you
know
;
"
and
he
fastened
his
dark
eyes
keenly
upon
her
.
"
<EOS>
But
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
I
came
here
to
speak
on
a
different
subject
,
and
one
that
,
if
truth
must
be
told
,
interests
me
more
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
on
,
then
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Emily
,
evidently
anxious
to
finish
the
conversation
as
soon
as
possible
:
"
I
listen
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
know
,
Emily
,
"
resumed
John
,
"
I
am
a
man
of
few
words
,
and
consequently
you
will
pardon
me
for
coming
at
once
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
""Proceed
!
"
said
Emily
,
as
he
paused
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
then
,
to
be
brief
,
I
came
here
to
tell
you
I
love
you
,
and
have
resolved
to
make
you
my
wife
.
<EOS>
""Good
God
!
"
exclaimed
Emily
,
staggering
back
at
this
sudden
and
altogether
unexpected
announcement
:
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
in
earnest
,
John?""Certainly
I
am
,
"
replied
he
,
coolly
;
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
I
like
you
better
than
any
woman
I
have
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
—
"
gasped
she
.
<EOS>
"O
,
never
mind
,
"
he
continued
,
interrupting
her
;
"
spare
your
remarks
—
it
is
all
settled
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
would
say
,
maiden
-
like
,
that
you
are
unworthy
and
all
that
:
but
I
will
spare
your
excuses
;
it
is
all
settled
;
we
will
be
married
in
a
month
,
and
then
if
you
choose
you
know
you
can
tell
me
afterward
.
"His
<EOS>
cool
impudent
manner
completely
puzzled
Emily
,
at
the
same
time
that
it
roused
her
indignation
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
believe
him
in
earnest
,
and
yet
a
kind
of
presentiment
whispered
her
he
was
so
.
<EOS>
If
he
was
in
earnest
,
she
foresaw
there
was
difficulty
in
embryo
,
and
how
to
extricate
herself
was
a
matter
of
serious
reflection
.
<EOS>
She
saw
at
once
,
that
in
either
case
,
whether
he
was
trifling
or
not
,
her
best
course
was
to
be
firm
and
decided
in
her
replies
,
and
<EOS>
accordingly
she
answered:"But
,
John
,
I
do
not
love
you
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
do
not
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Well
,
that
is
a
matter
of
small
moment
:
such
things
are
as
likely
to
come
after
marriage
as
before
.
<EOS>
""But
,
John
,
I
could
never
love
you!""May
-
be
,
though
that
can
best
be
proven
by
the
test
.
<EOS>
""But
,
surely
,
you
are
not
in
earnest
in
this
business
,
<EOS>
John?""Am
I
not
!
"
cried
he
,
somewhat
fiercely
,
with
a
black
look
.
"
<EOS>
Have
I
not
said
I
wasin
<EOS>
earnest?""But
<EOS>
you
have
not
consulted
my
feelings!""O
,
that
with
me
is
of
minor
importance!""But
not
with
me
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Emily
,
reddening
with
vexation
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
"
returned
he
,
sharply
,
"
on
that
point
suit
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
say
it
is
<EOS>
settled!""And
<EOS>
I
say
it
is
settled
—
"
rejoined
Emily
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
what
more
?
<EOS>
"
interrupted
he
.
"But
<EOS>
not
as
you
think
,
"
continued
she
,
finishing
the
sentence
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
as
I
<EOS>
think!—what
mean
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
glaring
upon
her
with
a
fierce
look
,
and
knitting
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"I
will
never
marry
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Never
marry
me
?
"
repeated
he
.
<EOS>
"Never
!
<EOS>
I
will
give
my
hand
only
where
I
love
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
,
taking
a
step
backward
—
his
whole
frame
shaking
with
fierce
passion
—
his
voice
trembling
so
he
could
scarcely
command
it
,
and
hissing
from
between
his
clenched
teeth
:
—
<EOS>
"
Are
you
in
earnest?""I
am
!
"
replied
she
,
firmly
,
though
inwardly
frightened
at
his
fierce
aspect
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
John
did
not
speak
,
during
which
his
features
underwent
contortions
awful
to
behold
and
impossible
to
describe
.
<EOS>
All
the
wild
demon
of
his
nature
was
aroused
,
and
every
evil
thought
and
passion
seemed
struggling
for
vent
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
grew
fiery
<EOS>
—
his
face
grew
livid
—
his
veins
swelled
,
marking
out
dark
blue
lines
—
his
brows
contracted
,
forming
a
black
streak
across
his
forehead
—
his
nostrils
expanded
—
his
bosom
heaved
—
<EOS>
his
teeth
closed
tightly
—
his
lips
contracted
,
from
which
issued
a
frothy
substance,—while
over
all
,
like
an
ignis
-
futuus
in
some
dismal
swamp
,
played
that
dark
,
sinister
,
devilish
smile
.
<EOS>
Emily
was
frightened
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
she
seen
or
dreamed
of
a
look
so
awful
.
<EOS>
Pale
and
breathless
<EOS>
she
stood
and
gazed
upon
him
,
as
one
hanging
over
some
mighty
chasm
might
be
supposed
to
gaze
upon
some
teriffic
monster
about
to
spring
and
hurl
both
to
destruction
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
nor
move
.
<EOS>
She
was
spell
-
bound
to
the
rock
.
<EOS>
—
For
some
moments
both
stood
thus
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
started
,
threw
up
both
hands
,
and
stamped
with
one
foot
fiercely
on
the
ground
;
and
then
from
between
his
teeth
hissed
these
words
,
which
made
her
blood
curdle:"You
have
said
!
<EOS>
you
have
rejected
me
!
<EOS>
Let
your
fate
save
you
if
it
can
!
<EOS>
Hear
me
:
<EOS>
By
every
thing
I
hold
most
sacred
,
I
swear
you
shall
be
mine
!
"
and
turning
away
he
rushed
like
a
madman
down
the
hill
toward
the
river
,
while
Emily
,
whose
nerves
had
been
held
rigid
by
fear
,
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
sank
fainting
upon
the
rock
.
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
Her
troubles
had
only
begun
.

CHAPTER
IV.THE
CONVERSATION
—
THE
MYSTERY
CANVASSED
—
<EOS>
THE
PLAN
TO
UNRAVEL
THE
MYSTERY
—
<EOS>
THE
PLOT
THICKENS.The
evening
succeeding
the
events
just
detailed
<EOS>
,
found
Webber
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
seated
in
the
room
to
the
right
of
the
entrance
of
the
residence
of
the
first
named
,
engaged
in
close
conversation
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
house
were
present
—
Emily
and
Mrs.
Webber
both
being
in
the
apartment
to
the
left
with
Rufus
,
—
who
by
the
way
was
considered
gradually
recovering
—
and
John
had
not
yet
returned
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
of
the
trio
referred
to
had
been
carried
on
for
some
time
on
various
topics
of
little
interest
to
the
reader
,
but
just
at
the
moment
we
have
chosen
to
again
introduce
them
,
it
had
taken
another
turn
,
which
,
as
it
has
a
bearing
on
our
story
,
is
necessary
for
us
to
relate
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
ask
me
,
"
remarked
Webber
,
in
reply
to
some
previous
question
of
Tyrone
,
"
what
I
know
of
her
history
?
<EOS>
I
answer
,
but
little
<EOS>
;
in
fact
,
absolutely
nothing
,
prior
to
her
being
left
in
my
charge
,
the
particulars
of
which
you
remember
I
gave
you
some
day
or
two
since
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
very
mysterious
about
the
matter
,
and
I
would
go
to
any
expense
within
my
power
to
have
it
cleared
up
.
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
I
often
grieve
for
her
;
for
although
she
in
my
presence
ever
appears
cheerful
and
contented
,
yet
I
have
watched
her
when
she
thought
herself
unseen
,
and
I
know
it
troubles
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
girl
of
thought
—
very
sensitive
withal
—
and
I
know
the
obscurity
of
her
birth
must
give
her
painful
feelings
.
<EOS>
Did
you
not
notice
how
pale
she
appeared
on
her
return
from
her
walk
in
the
morning?""I
did
,
"
answered
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"
She
looked
as
one
just
recovered
from
a
terrible
fright
.
<EOS>
""I
was
alarmed
myself
,
"
continued
Webber
,
"
and
thought
something
serious
had
taken
place
;
but
when
I
questioned
her
,
she
forced
a
smile
upon
her
pale
features
and
assured
me
it
was
nothing
but
a
little
dizziness
in
the
head
which
would
soon
pass
away
.
<EOS>
I
said
no
more
,
but
that
she
must
take
care
of
herself
—
thought
in
my
own
mind
the
disease
is
of
a
very
different
nature
.
<EOS>
—
Such
a
look
as
she
then
had
and
has
since
worn
,
notwithstanding
her
effort
to
conceal
it
,
is
never
produced
by
bodily
suffering
,
when
the
mind
is
in
the
proper
state
,
or
all
my
observations
have
gone
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
As
you
remarked
,
she
looked
as
a
person
who
had
been
frightened
;
though
what
should
occur
to
produce
that
I
do
not
know
,
unless
the
recalling
of
the
night
of
her
kidnapping
;
and
I
scarcely
know
how
that
,
at
this
time
,
should
so
effect
her
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
it
was
not
that
;
perhaps
she
saw
one
of
the
villains
concerned
in
that
business:—Gods
!
<EOS>
if
that
rascal
Curdish
had
not
escaped
me
!
"
<EOS>
(
here
Webber
shut
his
teeth
close
,
while
his
eyes
flashed
fiercely
)
"
yet
we
may
meet
again
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
;
and
then
resuming
the
conversation
where
he
had
broken
it
off
,
continued
:
—
"
But
if
she
had
seen
any
of
them
she
would
have
told
me
so
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
it
must
have
been
caused
by
her
own
serious
reflections
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
added
he
again
,
as
if
struck
by
some
new
thought
,
"
perhaps
Merton
—
but
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
Merton
is
an
honorable
man
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
—
"
he
was
about
to
say
something
concerning
Rufus
,
but
thinking
better
of
it
,
paused
.
<EOS>
"Speaking
<EOS>
of
that
night
,
Webber
,
"
remarked
Tyrone
,
"
have
you
ever
formed
any
idea
of
the
design
of
those
ruffians
in
seizing
upon
her
person?""Why
no
,
unless
for
sensual
gratification
.
<EOS>
""That
warnt
<EOS>
it
,
"
put
in
Bernard
,
who
had
for
some
time
been
a
listener
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
a
thinking
the
hull
matter
over
myself
,
and
I
tell
ye
for
sartain
that
warnt
it
.
<EOS>
There
's
something
plaguey
mysterious
about
it
;
and
since
you
've
been
a
talking
,
an
idea
's
popped
into
my
head
that
that
are
scrape
was
brought
about
by
a
different
cause
from
what
you
think
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
"
said
Webber
;
"
and
pray
what
cause
<EOS>
de
you
assign
for
it
,
Harvey?"At
<EOS>
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
John
Webber
entered
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
somewhat
pale
,
but
in
other
respects
much
as
usual
;
though
a
close
observer
might
have
detected
the
previous
workings
of
passion
,
as
little
marks
in
a
forest
tell
of
the
storm
that
has
just
swept
over
it
.
<EOS>
With
a
simple
nod
of
recognition
to
the
occupants
he
took
up
a
chair
and
seated
himself
some
distance
from
them
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
John
,
"
said
his
father
,
turning
to
him
,
"
why
do
you
absent
yourself
thus
of
late
?
<EOS>
and
at
a
time
too
when
you
are
most
wanted
at
home
?
<EOS>
You
know
there
is
much
labor
needed
on
the
farm
,
and
I
am
not
able
to
accomplish
it
alone
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Besides
,
too
,
your
brother
has
been
very
sick
,
but
by
God
's
blessing
is
now
better
!
<EOS>
though
he
might
have
been
dead
and
buried
without
you
being
the
wiser
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
you
but
twice
during
his
illness
.
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been?""I
have
had
business
to
keep
me
absent
,
"
replied
John
,
sullenly
,
evading
a
direct
answer
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
you
always
have
business
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Webber
,
rather
sharply
;
"
but
I
trust
you
will
close
your
business
soon
,
if
you
have
not
already
done
so
,
and
be
a
little
more
at
home!""I
trust
I
am
of
age
and
can
act
for
myself
!
"
<EOS>
grumbled
John
.
<EOS>
Webber
,
who
knew
too
well
his
son
's
morose
disposition
and
evil
temper
to
carry
the
matter
farther
at
present
,
made
no
reply
,
but
turning
to
Bernard
,
said
:
"
I
will
now
hear
your
answer
with
regard
to
what
you
suppose
the
cause
.
<EOS>
""Wal
,
as
I
was
saying
,
"
returned
Bernard
,
"
while
you
've
been
talking
,
I
've
been
a
thinking
the
matter
over
,
and
I
remember
hearing
one
o
'
<EOS>
them
are
rascals
,
in
his
conversation
with
the
tother
,
say
that
the
old
feller
what
hired
'em
,
and
the
gal
,
and
some
other
feller
was
all
kind
<EOS>
o
'
mixed
up
into
a
secret
—
at
least
he
guessed
so
,
from
knowing
the
first
old
feller'd
<EOS>
got
hold
o
'
some
papers
,
and
had
been
mighty
anxious
to
git
the
gal
ever
since
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
true
,
true
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Tyrone
;
"
I
remember
now
hearing
the
same
remark
;
but
not
knowing
then
to
whom
it
referred
,
had
quite
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
""Strange
!
<EOS>
strange
!
<EOS>
"
said
Webber
,
thoughtfully
;
"
more
mystery
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
possible
there
was
some
one
at
the
bottom
of
that
affair
who
knows
her
history
?
<EOS>
It
may
be
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
think
of
it
,
the
more
mysterious
everything
concerning
it
appears
.
<EOS>
My
mind
has
been
so
much
occupied
with
the
uncertain
fate
of
my
son
since
that
event
,
that
I
have
never
till
now
thought
of
it
so
seriously
;
and
have
never
even
questioned
Emily
or
Merton
on
the
subject
—
what
took
place
—
how
he
found
her
—
or
how
she
was
rescued
;
but
I
will
do
so
now
,
and
perhaps
she
will
be
able
to
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
As
he
spoke
,
he
arose
,
passed
out
of
the
room
,
and
presently
returned
with
the
object
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
The
features
of
Emily
as
she
entered
were
very
pale
,
their
expression
very
sad
;
and
though
she
strove
to
look
cheerful
,
it
was
evident
to
all
she
was
undergoing
severe
mental
suffering
.
<EOS>
As
she
came
forward
and
took
her
seat
,
her
eye
fell
upon
John
,
and
she
gave
an
involuntary
start
,
while
every
muscle
of
her
face
quivered
.
<EOS>
"Good
heavens
,
Emily
,
you
are
not
well
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Webber
,
as
he
noticed
the
change
in
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
my
child
,
truly
,
are
you
not
ill?""I
—
I
did
feel
a
little
unwell
,
just
at
this
moment
,
"
replied
Emily
,
by
a
mighty
effort
recover
ing
her
composure
;
"
but
I
am
better
now
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
"
she
added
,
seeing
Webber
looked
at
her
doubtfully
,
"
I
feel
quite
well
again
.
<EOS>
"Webber
<EOS>
shook
his
head
gravely
;
and
then
,
as
if
fearful
of
agitating
her
,
proceeded
directly
to
the
matter
in
point
.
<EOS>
"We
were
talking
,
Emily
,
of
the
events
of
that
night
of
your
seizure
by
those
ruffians
,
and
have
sent
for
you
to
give
us
the
particulars
of
what
you
saw
and
heard
.
<EOS>
"Glad
of
anything
that
would
for
a
moment
relieve
her
mind
of
the
painful
thoughts
now
agitating
her
,
Emily
proceeded
at
once
to
give
a
full
narration
of
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
herself
,
and
also
the
particulars
of
Edward
's
adventures
,
as
related
by
himself
on
that
eventful
night
,
all
of
which
matters
being
familiar
to
the
reader
,
we
shall
not
again
detail
.
<EOS>
"Depend
<EOS>
upon't
<EOS>
,
I
's
right
!
"
<EOS>
said
Bernard
,
triumphantly
,
as
Emily
concluded
.
<EOS>
"
That
are
stingy
old
Jew
warnt
doing
that
are
rascally
business
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
rejoined
Webber
,
thoughtfully
,
"
there
does
appear
a
mysterious
connection
between
that
and
what
has
gone
before
.
<EOS>
And
then
that
old
woman
's
warning
—
her
knowledge
of
what
was
taking
place
—
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
stranger
,
who
gave
his
name
as
Barton
—
the
ring
and
its
wonderful
effect
upon
the
Jew
,
are
matters
which
look
very
mysterious
,
and
show
a
deep
laid
plot
of
some
kind,—and
then
that
conversation
between
the
kidnapper
and
the
Jew
indicates
that
the
latter
has
some
,
or
at
least
thinks
he
has
some
,
secret
knowledge
of
Emily
.
<EOS>
This
affair
must
be
looked
into
at
once
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
again
,
that
counter
-
plot
of
the
ring
—
what
had
that
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
Barton
,
too
,
Barton
<EOS>
,
"
continued
he
,
musingly
,
"
why
I
know
one
of
that
name
—
a
gentleman
that
has
been
some
time
in
these
parts
—
a
speculator
in
land
—
can
it
be
that
he
is
the
same
?
<EOS>
But
no
—
pshaw
!
<EOS>
what
should
he
know
of
the
Jew
?
<EOS>
What
think
you
of
the
whole
affair
,
Tyrone?""Why
that
is
what
I
hardly
know
myself
,
"
answered
the
person
addressed
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
say
,
it
appears
like
a
deep
laid
scheme
in
the
first
instance
;
but
then
that
counter
-
plot
,
or
whatever
it
may
be
,
perplexes
me
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
an
idea
strikes
me
:
May
it
not
be
possible
that
these
ruffians
are
a
part
of
an
organised
band
,
who
were
acting
without
the
knowledge
of
their
leader
,
or
carrying
out
some
plan
of
his
before
it
was
fully
ripe
for
execution
,
and
so
were
interrupted
by
him?""Heavens
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Webber
,
starting
<EOS>
;
"
I
think
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
At
least
there
has
been
a
band
of
outlaws
in
this
quarter
;
for
when
I
first
came
here
,
it
was
almost
a
daily
occurence
to
hear
of
horse
-
stealing
,
robbery
,
and
even
murder
;
and
the
name
of
Ronald
Bonardi
,
the
bold
,
reckless
leader
of
this
banditti
,
was
passed
from
ear
to
ear
,
among
the
more
timid
,
with
feelings
of
superstitious
awe
and
horror
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
to
such
an
alarming
extent
were
his
depredations
carried
on
,
at
one
time
,
that
the
whole
country
became
aroused
,
private
meetings
were
held
among
the
more
peaceable
citizens
or
settlers
,
and
a
heavy
reward
was
offered
to
any
one
who
should
take
him
dead
or
alive
;
but
he
was
never
caught
.
<EOS>
It
was
supposed
he
got
information
of
their
proceedings
and
left
this
part
of
the
country
;
for
since
that
time
,
with
but
few
exceptions
,
the
settlers
have
remained
undisturbed
—
though
I
have
heard
of
some
few
exploits
since
,
that
smack
of
his
,
but
for
the
most
part
they
happened
east
of
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
jest
recollect
hearing
the
same
kind
<EOS>
o
'
yarns
told
about
that
are
chap
when
I
's
out
this
way
afore
,
"
said
Bernard
;
"
and
I
told
Mark
here
,
when
I
seed
that
are
harrycane
coming
up
,
and
knowed
we
'd
have
to
crawl
into
the
cave
,
that
like
as
not
we
'd
get
into
a
robber
's
nest
,
and
it
made
Mark
quite
skeery
like
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
"
exclaimed
Tyrone
,
with
an
angry
gesture
,
the
color
deepening
in
his
face
;
"
have
done
with
such
nonsense
,
Bernard!""Fact
,
I
swow
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Bernard
,
looking
slyly
at
Webber
and
giving
him
the
wink
.
<EOS>
Webber
smiled
,
but
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
"What
was
the
personal
appearance
of
this
bandit
chief
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Tyrone
,
not
heeding
the
last
remark
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
size
he
was
rather
large
and
well
formed
,
"
replied
Webber
;
"
at
least
that
seems
the
most
correct
information
on
the
subject
;
though
some
who
saw
him
solemnly
declared
him
to
be
a
monster
—
a
giant
;
but
doubtless
their
fears
made
them
exaggerate
.
<EOS>
His
features
I
believe
were
never
seen
,
as
he
always
wore
a
mask
.
<EOS>
In
some
of
his
exploits
—
in
fact
I
may
say
all
—
he
exhibited
a
wild
eccentricity
of
manner
,
that
distinguished
him
from
all
his
followers
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
described
by
some
as
bloodthirsty
and
utterly
ferocious
;
but
then
,
again
,
others
relate
anecdotes
which
prove
him
,
notwithstanding
,
to
have
been
a
man
of
feeling
;
for
he
has
been
known
to
rob
an
individual
and
then
return
him
his
money
,
when
he
saw
he
was
likely
to
be
distressed
by
the
loss
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
too
,
a
poor
man
has
been
surprised
at
having
a
purse
of
money
placed
in
his
hand
,
by
a
masked
stranger
,
accompanied
with
these
words
,
uttered
in
a
slow
,
solemn
tone
:
`
Remember
in
turn
the
needy
,
and
in
your
prayers
forget
not
Ronald
Bonardi
.
'
"
<EOS>
"
A
singular
being
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Tyrone
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
had
,
decidedly
,
some
fine
redeeming
traits
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
him
still
living?""As
to
that
<EOS>
I
am
undecided
,
"
answered
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
he
be
living
,
he
has
either
reformed
or
left
this
part
of
the
country
—
for
of
late
I
have
heard
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
the
opinion
,
however
,
that
he
is
living
,
but
has
quit
his
former
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
Were
he
still
in
this
vicinity
,
I
should
be
strongly
inclined
to
believe
him
the
person
who
gave
Merton
the
ring
—
<EOS>
it
being
somewhat
characteristic
of
the
man
—
were
it
not
for
one
or
two
reasons
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
Bonardi
would
not
have
revealed
his
features
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
this
person
gave
his
name
as
Barton
,
and
Bonardi
would
have
given
his
own
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
when
he
gave
his
name
as
Bonardi
,
his
features
,
by
your
account
,
were
always
masked
,
"
remarked
Tyrone
;
"
consequently
,
unmasked
,
no
person
would
know
him
as
Bonardi
;
and
might
he
not
,
under
such
circumstances
,
give
his
name
as
Barton?""Such
a
thing
might
be
,
it
is
true
,
"
replied
Webber
,
thoughtfully
,
"
but
I
do
not
think
it
likely
.
<EOS>
In
sooth
,
to
me
the
whole
affair
looks
improbable
,
from
the
fact
that
I
do
not
believe
Bonardi
to
be
in
this
section
,
or
we
should
ere
this
have
heard
of
him
.
<EOS>
No
,
now
that
I
think
of
it
again
,
Tyrone
,
your
suggestion
that
these
ruffians
are
a
part
of
an
organised
band
,
does
not
appear
so
plausible
.
<EOS>
I
should
rather
judge
them
to
be
some
low
,
desperate
characters
,
employed
for
the
occasion
by
the
Jew
,
whose
reputation
as
a
cowardly
villain
is
wide
spread
.
<EOS>
The
ring
business
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
that
this
was
a
signal
,
understood
among
themselves
as
indicating
danger
,
and
to
forego
their
design
,
whatever
it
was
,
until
a
better
opportunity
should
present
itself
.
<EOS>
If
this
was
the
case
,
their
cards
were
well
played
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
question
Merton
,
when
I
see
him
,
and
get
more
of
the
particulars
.
<EOS>
""Speaking
of
these
matters
,
Webber
,
did
you
not
feel
unsafe
here
,
with
your
family
,
when
you
first
settled
,
knowing
that
you
were
surrounded
by
such
a
band
of
desperadoes
,
and
in
a
country
too
so
thinly
populated
that
you
would
be
likely
to
get
no
assistance
,
even
if
attacked
,
with
no
laws
of
force
sufficient
to
protect
either
property
or
person
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Tyrone
.
"Why
<EOS>
,
such
matters
did
trouble
me
some
at
first
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Webber
;
"
and
in
consequence
of
this
I
built
my
cottage
very
strong
,
and
secured
me
some
dozen
of
good
rifles
and
plenty
of
ammunition
—
which
I
still
have
on
hand
—
though
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
molested
,
nor
had
occasion
to
use
them
.
<EOS>
The
seizure
of
Emily
is
the
first
trouble
of
the
kind
that
has
ever
happened
with
any
of
my
family
:
and
somehow
I
have
never
looked
on
this
so
seriously
as
I
do
now
;
for
since
all
the
circumstances
have
been
explained
,
I
think
there
will
be
more
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
be
alarmed
,
Emily
,
"
continued
he
,
addressing
himself
more
directly
to
her
;
"
you
shall
be
protected
;
only
do
not
venture
out
too
far
alone
—
at
least
not
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
""Rest
<EOS>
assured
I
shall
not
!
"
said
Emily
,
stealing
a
look
at
John
,
who
sat
perfectly
unmoved
,
apparently
heeding
nothing
that
was
said
.
<EOS>
"What
course
do
you
intend
to
pursue
,
in
regard
to
this
matter
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
I
depend
upon
you
to
assist
me
,
Tyrone?""You
can
,
to
all
that
lies
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
,
Harvey
<EOS>
,
I
know
will
stand
by
an
old
friend!""Wal
<EOS>
I
guess
I
will
now
,
"
answered
Bernard
,
his
cheeks
flushing
and
his
eye
brightening
at
this
complimentary
appeal
to
his
courage
:
"
<EOS>
I
guess
I
will
now
;
jest
try
me
and
see
if
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
Stand
by
ye
,
Bill
Webber
—
you
who
I
've
known
ever
since
I
was
a
leetle
boy
—
why
,
darn
me
for
a
sneaking
coward
,
if
I
wo
nt
go
it
clean
to
the
death
,
plum
!
<EOS>
I
swow
I
will
,
and
no
backing!""Well
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Webber
,
smiling
at
the
enthusiasm
of
his
friend
,
"
my
course
is
decided
.
<EOS>
We
will
arm
ourselves
and
proceed
at
once
to
the
hut
of
the
old
woman
,
who
seems
to
know
so
much
of
the
matter
,
and
force
her
to
reveal
the
full
particulars
,
who
were
the
instigators
,
actors
,
and
also
their
whereabouts
at
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
We
will
then
take
her
along
with
us
,
both
as
a
guide
and
to
prevent
her
communicating
with
any
of
the
villains
,
and
proceed
next
to
the
hut
of
the
old
Jew
,
whom
I
shall
take
into
custody
for
further
examination
;
and
if
he
has
any
secret
papers
,
concerning
Emily
,
I
will
have
them
,
and
know
how
he
obtained
them
.
<EOS>
We
will
then
return
,
and
if
it
be
necessary
for
more
help
,
in
order
to
secure
the
others
,
I
will
call
upon
neighbor
Winslow
—
who
has
lately
settled
within
a
mile
of
me
,
and
has
five
brave
,
hardy
sons
—
and
neighbor
Mason
,
living
some
half
a
mile
farther
on
,
who
has
four
more
;
and
between
the
two
families
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
raise
sufficient
force
to
teach
these
ruffians
better
manners
than
meddling
with
me
or
mine
!
<EOS>
By
heavens
!
<EOS>
and
I
will
so
teach
them
too
,
ere
<EOS>
I
have
done
with
them
,
or
my
name
is
not
William
Webber!""Jest
<EOS>
the
same
old
grit
in
ye
yit
!
"
remarked
Bernard
,
approvingly
.
"
<EOS>
Jest
the
same
Bill
Webber
you
used
to
be
!
<EOS>
You
always
had
a
go
-
a
-
head
-
a
-
tiveness
about
ye
,
when
there
was
any
pluck
needed
.
<EOS>
I
haint
forgot
how
you
gin
it
to
that
<EOS>
are
tarnal
horse
-
thief
<EOS>
,
that
was
so
plaguey
desperate
nobody
else
dared
to
touch
him
,
and
you
only
a
boy
then
,
as
one
may
say
.
<EOS>
""That
was
a
hard
fight
,
"
returned
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
could
not
handle
myself
so
well
now
,
as
then
;
but
still
I
think
I
could
do
something
,
if
forced
into
a
fight
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
when
do
you
think
of
proceeding
in
this
business
?
"
asked
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"Early
<EOS>
on
to
-
morrow
,
"
replied
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
too
long
delayed
already
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
the
severe
illness
of
Rufus
,
I
should
have
enquired
into
the
matter
sooner
,
and
long
ere
<EOS>
this
would
have
been
like
a
blood
-
hound
on
the
track
of
the
ruffians
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
better
though
,
as
it
is
;
for
they
would
then
,
doubtless
,
have
been
on
their
guard
—
expecting
,
as
they
naturally
would
,
a
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Now
I
trust
to
take
them
unawares
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
do
you
not
think
they
have
fled
the
country
?
"
asked
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"No
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
;
from
the
fact
,
as
it
appears
,
that
the
person
of
Emily
is
what
they
sought
;
and
they
will
be
likely
to
hover
in
the
vicinity
for
a
second
trial
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
the
way
,
Webber
,
a
thought
strikes
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tyrone
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
been
able
to
account
for
the
escape
of
Curdish?""No
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Webber
,
"
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
That
was
another
very
mysterious
affair
,
which
has
perplexed
me
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
No
one
could
have
entered
the
house
after
John
came
home
,
for
the
door
was
bolted
on
the
inside
;
and
after
that
I
looked
into
the
room
,
and
saw
Curdish
still
there
;
otherwise
I
should
have
supposed
he
escaped
by
means
of
a
false
key
;
but
had
he
done
so
<EOS>
,
the
outer
door
would
not
have
remained
bolted
on
the
inside
,
as
was
the
case
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
What
think
you
of
it
,
John?""I
know
nothing
about
it"—muttered
<EOS>
John
—
"
<EOS>
only
that
I
see
nothing
so
very
mysterious
concerning
it
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
door
being
bolted
on
the
inside
,
I
can
say
,
that
having
occasion
to
get
up
in
the
night
,
I
found
it
standing
open
,
and
bolted
it
myself
.
<EOS>
Curdy
,
or
Curdish
,
or
whatever
his
name
may
be
,
might
have
had
a
false
key
for
all
I
know
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
Such
things
are
too
common
,
I
think
,
to
be
very
mysterious
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
this
explains
it
then
!
"
rejoined
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
mention
this
before
,
<EOS>
John?""Because
<EOS>
I
'm
not
very
talkative
,
"
replied
John
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
said
Webber
,
with
a
stern
look
,
"
should
I
be
so
fortunate
as
to
again
have
him
in
my
power
,
it
will
require
something
more
than
false
keys
to
save
him
!
"
<EOS>
A
pause
followed
this
last
remark
,
and
each
individual
appeared
absorbed
in
thought
.
<EOS>
Webber
at
length
resumed
the
conversation
,
by
asking
Bernard
how
long
he
intended
to
remain
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
"Wal
<EOS>
,
as
to
that
,
"
replied
Bernard
,
"
it
depends
altogether
on
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
jest
cum
out
with
friend
Mark
,
here
,
to
look
at
the
land
in
these
ere
diggins
,
and
see
what
sort
of
a
speculation
I
might
make
;
but
as
you
've
got
into
a
bit
of
a
fuss
here
,
I
'll
jest
<EOS>
kind
o
'
keep
an
eye
in
this
ere
quarter
,
and
be
ready
to
do
all
I
can
for
ye
.
<EOS>
""Thank
<EOS>
you
,
Harvey
!
"
returned
Webber
,
warmly
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
Tyrone
,
how
is
it
with
you?""Why
,
as
Bernard
has
just
remarked
,
I
came
out
here
to
examine
the
state
of
the
country
,
and
attend
to
some
professional
business
in
St.
Louis
.
<EOS>
By
profession
,
as
you
are
aware
,
I
am
a
lawyer
—
though
but
lately
admitted
to
the
bar
.
<EOS>
I
had
an
opportunity
some
months
since
of
purchasing
a
section
of
land
—
north
of
,
but
bordering
on
the
Missouri
—
which
I
embraced
.
<EOS>
Some
time
after
,
I
received
a
letter
from
a
gentleman
in
St.
Louis
,
offering
me
for
it
four
times
the
amount
I
paid
.
<EOS>
This
excited
my
curiosity
to
know
what
had
induced
the
offer
;
and
as
I
had
a
desire
of
seeing
this
western
country
—
of
which
so
much
has
been
said
of
late
—
and
as
my
friend
Bernard
was
desirous
of
coming
out
here
also
,
I
concluded
to
be
his
companion
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
of
you
frequently
,
from
various
sources
,
and
Bernard
being
an
old
schoolmate
of
yours
,
I
determined
on
paying
you
a
visit
.
<EOS>
""I
am
right
glad
you
have
done
so
,
"
returned
Webber
,
cordially
;
"
and
there
seems
almost
a
Providence
in
your
very
conclusion
,
from
the
fact
that
you
came
so
opportune
;
for
without
your
timely
assistance
I
know
not
what
might
have
been
the
result
of
that
knavish
affair
.
<EOS>
I
trust
you
will
consider
my
house
your
home
,
so
long
as
you
choose
to
remain
in
the
West
;
and
for
the
invaluable
service
both
you
and
Bernard
have
already
rendered
me
and
mine
,
accept
my
warmest
thanks
,
and
hold
me
ever
gratful
.
<EOS>
""As
for
myself
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Emily
,
rising
<EOS>
,
"
I
can
not
express
what
I
feel
;
but
you
may
conceive
it
somewhat
,
when
I
say
that
to
both
of
you
,
under
God
,
I
hold
myself
indebted
—
though
perhaps
indirectly
—
for
the
preservation
of
my
honor
,
which
of
course
is
dearer
to
me
than
life
;
"
and
stepping
gracefully
forward
,
she
frankly
extended
a
hand
to
each
,
her
eyes
beaming
with
the
grateful
emotions
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Both
Bernard
and
Tyrone
were
affected
at
this
unexpected
elucidation
of
feeling
—
this
heart
-
touching
frankness
of
Webber
and
Emily
,
the
latter
more
especially
—
and
in
spite
of
themselves
both
felt
their
eyes
growing
moist
.
<EOS>
"Hang
it
all
!
<EOS>
"
returned
Bernard
,
at
length
,
drawing
his
hard
,
rough
hand
across
his
eyes
,
"
you
make
a
feller
soft
jest
for
nothing
,
Emily
,
I
swow
!
<EOS>
Why
we
did
n't
du
a
tarnal
thing
for
ye
,
hardly
,
and
<EOS>
yit
you
're
praising
on
us
jest
as
if
we
'd
done
some
great
things
.
<EOS>
Take
it
all
back
,
Emily
,
du
,
until
we
've
done
something
worth
talking
about
.
<EOS>
I
can
stand
fighting
putty
tolerable
well
,
but
<EOS>
a
woman
's
soft
talk
clean
upsets
me
altogether
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
but
be
affected
at
your
noble
frankness
,
Emily
,
"
said
Tyrone
,
gazing
tenderly
upon
her
;
"
<EOS>
but
as
Bernard
has
just
remarked
,
I
would
you
had
waited
until
we
did
something
more
deserving
;
though
God
knows
,
Emily
,
I
will
sacrifice
my
life
for
you
if
necessary!""Put
me
in
<EOS>
that
are
scrape
,
Mark
!
<EOS>
put
me
in
that
are
scrape
,
tu
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bernard
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
Emily
's
turn
to
be
affected
;
and
without
venturing
a
reply
,
she
pressed
their
hands
,
turned
away
and
abruptly
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
A
moment
after
,
John
arose
and
disappeared
also
—
for
what
purpose
will
be
seen
anon
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
,
a
horse
,
bearing
a
rider
,
might
have
been
heard
going
swiftly
toward
the
east
.
<EOS>
After
some
further
conversation
,
not
essential
to
our
story
,
Webber
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
,
together
with
Mrs.
Webber
and
Emily
,
retired
for
the
night
,
and
the
outer
door
was
strongly
bolted
,
though
John
had
not
returned
.

THE
OATH.The
detail
of
our

now
calls
us
to
the
old
hovel
made
somewhat
conspicuous
in
the
former
part
of
it
by
the
events
which
then
transpired
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
The
same
evening
on
which
the
foregoing
conversation
occurred
—
though
perhaps
at
a
later
hour
—
a
group
of
five
rough
,
villainous
looking
fellows
were
assembled
within
the
walls
of
the
hut
boasting
Hetty
Brogan
for
a
hostess
.
<EOS>
Four
of
these
ruffians
were
the
same
as
seen
at
the
cave
on
the
night
of
the
meeting
of
the
banditti
,
then
described
as
plotting
among
themselves
some
deed
of
wickedness
.
<EOS>
They
were
seated
on
rough
benches
,
around
a
plain
deal
table
,
whereon
lay
a
small
pile
of
money
,
the
owner
of
which
was
to
be
determined
by
the
cards
now
held
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Near
one
corner
of
the
table
stood
a
feeble
ligbt
,
seemingly
struggling
with
the
surrounding
darkness
,
while
opposite
it
was
a
bottle
,
evidently
more
for
use
than
ornament
,
judging
by
the
reddened
eyes
and
swollen
flushed
faces
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
The
fifth
person
—
for
there
were
five
besides
the
hostess
—
was
standing
a
little
back
,
so
much
in
the
shade
that
his
features
were
undiscernable
,
and
engaged
with
the
latter
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
The
game
at
the
table
just
at
this
point
had
become
very
interesting
,
if
one
were
to
judge
by
the
earnest
expression
in
each
of
their
faces
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
party
had
thrown
up
their
cards
,
and
were
watching
with
intense
interest
the
proceedings
of
the
other
two
,
who
were
drawing
their
money
preparatory
to
increasing
the
stakes
.
<EOS>
"Here
,
Saxton"—said
one
of
the
two
last
mentioned
,
whose
arm
was
confined
in
a
sling
,
addressing
one
of
the
others
,
and
placing
at
the
same
time
a
well
filled
purse
on
the
table—"jest
unloose
<EOS>
that
ar
'
a
bit
<EOS>
;
I
haint
got
the
use
of
my
fingers
enough
for
such
fine
work
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
other
complied
,
and
at
his
second
request
emptied
the
contents
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
Thar
's
the
shiners
for
ye
,
Niles"—he
continued—"jest
go
ahead
,
who
's
afeard?""I
<EOS>
ai
nt
,
"
answered
Niles
,
the
very
picture
of
a
ruffian
and
his
opponent
for
the
stakes
;
"
I
ai
nt
afeard
,
so
here
goes
five
shiners
better
;
"
and
he
added
a
handful
of
money
to
the
stakes
lying
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"You
want
to
brag
,
hey
!
<EOS>
do
ye
?
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha!—hang
me
,
but
you
shall
brag
for
something
,
then
!
<EOS>
Thar
's
yer
five
and
ten
better
;
"
and
Curdish
—
for
the
reader
has
doubtless
recognised
him
—
threw
down
fifteen
dollars
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
do
n't
blaff
me
that
way
,
croney
,
"
said
Niles
,
at
the
same
time
adding
seven
half
eagles
to
the
pile
;
"
thar
's
twenty
-
five
dollars
better
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
"
observed
Curdish
,
"
all
or
nothing
—
thems
my
sentiments
!
"
<EOS>
and
after
counting
what
money
still
remained
,
he
pushed
the
whole
into
the
centre
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
what
'
ve
ye
got
?
"
asked
Niles
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
reckon
<EOS>
it
takes
a
cool
ten
yit
,
Mr.
Niles
,
afore
you
'll
be
allowed
to
ask
that
ar
'
perticular
question
;
"
replied
Curdish
,
rather
sarcastically
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
broke
,
Jack
,
"
rejoined
the
other
;
"
jest
draw
out
that
ar
'
ten
of
yourn!""No
,
by
Jupiter
,
I
do
nt
!
"
<EOS>
growled
Curdish
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"Then
we
'll
jest
fight
for
stakes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Niles
,
grasping
the
money
with
one
hand
,
and
drawing
a
pistol
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
Curdish
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
oath
,
and
the
consequences
might
have
been
fatal
to
one
or
both
,
had
not
the
others
interfered
and
restrained
them
.
<EOS>
The
matter
was
finally
settled
by
Saxton
loaning
Niles
ten
dollars
,
which
made
the
stakes
even
,
and
a
decision
was
called
for
.
<EOS>
"Three
<EOS>
aces
and
a
pair
of
kings
!
"
said
Niles
,
throwing
down
his
hand
with
a
triumphant
look
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
roared
Curdish
,
throwing
down
a
flush
.
<EOS>
"
I
reckon
as
how
I
'll
take
them
<EOS>
ar
'
stakes
,
Mr.
Niles!""Beat
by
—
!
"
<EOS>
grumbled
the
other
,
uttering
an
oath
,
while
Curdish
with
one
hand
commenced
transferring
the
money
to
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"Hurray
,
old
woman
!
<EOS>
more
of
that
ar
'
licher
here
,
d'ye
hear
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Curdish
,
whose
success
made
him
feel
rather
elated
.
"
<EOS>
By
Jupiter
!
<EOS>
we
'll
have
a
merry
night
—
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Blast
me
,
but
we
'll
have
a
night
<EOS>
on't
—
<EOS>
hey
,
Bill
Riley!—ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
and
rising
from
his
seat
<EOS>
,
he
reached
forth
his
brawny
hand
and
gave
Riley
—
whom
we
have
noticed
as
the
one
standing
apart
in
conversation
with
Hetty
—
a
familiar
slap
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"Hush
!
<EOS>
Jack
,
"
returned
Riley
;
"
do
n't
go
to
bein
'
so
boisterous
now
.
<EOS>
""Boisterous!"—ha
,
ha
,
ha!—who
's
a
better
right
!
<EOS>
plenty
o
'
money
,
by
Jupiter
!
"
and
Curdish
brought
his
hand
down
with
force
on
his
pocket
,
making
the
contents
jingle
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
laugh
as
can
laugh
last
,
Jack
Curdish
!
"
said
Niles
,
somewhat
fiercely
,
who
felt
vexed
and
mortified
both
at
his
loss
and
the
hilarity
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Saxton
,
will
ye
jest
lend
me
another
five?""No
!
"
answered
Saxton
;
"
no
more
playing
to
-
night
!
<EOS>
We
've
got
other
business
to
look
to
.
<EOS>
""Right
,
thar
'
,
my
trump
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Curdish
,
with
an
oath
:
"
I
'd
like
to
have
forgot
it
.
<EOS>
Hurray
!
<EOS>
here
comes
Hetty
with
more
licker
.
<EOS>
Blast
me
,
but
she
's
an
ace
o
'
trumps
,
is
Hetty
!
<EOS>
Hurray
,
boys
!
<EOS>
take
another
pull
all
round
—
jest
to
steady
nerves
,
you
know
,
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
—
and
then
let
's
to
business
.
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
Hetty
,
who
according
to
Curdish
's
orders
had
taken
the
bottle
to
refill
,
returned
and
placed
it
on
the
table
,
saying:"Thar
's
the
rale
genewine
critter
,
gintlemen
,
for
them
as
wants
to
drink
:
none
better
in
the
United
States
of
Amerecay
,
although
I
sez
it
as
shouldn't
.
<EOS>
"Whether
<EOS>
the
gentlemen
thought
so
or
not
,
they
made
no
remark
,
but
the
bottle
went
round
until
its
contents
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
As
Curdish
,
who
was
the
last
to
drink
,
placed
it
again
on
the
table
,
he
turned
to
Riley
,
and
in
a
low
voice
<EOS>
said:"That
ar
'
fifty
of
the
old
Jew
told
tolerable
well
to
-
night
in
the
way
of
interest,—hey
,
Bill!—ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
So
the
old
villain
chuckled
did
he
,
to
think
as
how
I
's
dead
,
and
warnt
a
goin'
to
pay
over
the
chinkers
?
<EOS>
Hang
me
,
but
we
'll
have
a
settlement
some
day
!
<EOS>
I
jest
<EOS>
kind
o
'
owe
him
<EOS>
a
few"—here
Curdish
set
his
teeth
hard
,
and
uttered
a
horrible
oath
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
say
,
Bill
,
how
d'ye
come
out
with
the
cap'en?""O
<EOS>
,
I
jest
got
a
little
severe
talkin
'
to
,
and
caution
about
the
future
,
that
's
all
,
"
replied
Riley
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
what
's
the
reason
<EOS>
you
warnt
thar
'
<EOS>
the
night
of
the
meetin
'
?
"
asked
Curdish
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
ye
see
,
arter
<EOS>
I
got
my
money
of
old
David
<EOS>
,
I
put
off
to
St.
Louis
,
got
on
a
spree
,
and
forgot
all
about
it
till
the
thing
was
all
over
with
.
<EOS>
""Did
<EOS>
the
cap'en
want
to
know
anything
about
that
ar
'
scrape
with
the
gal?""Yes
,
he
axed
me
very
perticular
about
it
,
and
then
insiniwated
that
another
such
a
scrape
might
be
likely
to
injure
my
health
.
<EOS>
""Used
me
<EOS>
jest
the
same
way
,
"
said
Curdish
,
with
an
oath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Blast
me
,
but
he
's
gittin
'
a
leetle
too
perticular
!
<EOS>
Wonder
if
he
thinks
us
gentlemen
ar
'
a
goin'
to
be
idle
<EOS>
all
our
lives
?
<EOS>
Since
he
's
got
married
,
hang
me
if
he
does
anything
as
he
used
to
do
it
!
<EOS>
He
with
a
wife,—ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
—
Why
four
year
ago
,
I
'd
jest
as
soon
thought
of

<EOS>
Me

<EOS>
Bill
—
ha
,
ha
,
ha!—how'd
<EOS>
I
look
with
a
woman
tied
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
Here
Curdish
,
excited
by
the
liquor
he
had
drank
,
and
what
he
conceived
to
be
the
ridiculousness
of
such
an
idea
,
burst
into
a
hearty
roar
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
yer
perticular
opinion
about
it
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
he
at
length
,
recovering
his
gravity
,
and
turning
to
the
rest
of
the
party
,
who
were
conversing
among
themselves
:
"
do
nt
ye
think
the
cap'en
's
gittin
'
a
leetle
too
perticular
<EOS>
lately?""Why
that
's
my
opinion
,
"
answered
Saxton
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
them

my
sentiments
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Curdish
,
with
another
oath
;
"
and
blast
me
if
I
don't—""Hush
!
<EOS>

careful

<EOS>

Riley
<EOS>
;
"
remember

about
our
cap'en!""Well

"
<EOS>
growled
Curdish
,
frowning
;
"
he
arnt
no
more
than
a
man

and
I
'm
a

Sposin

I

<EOS>
d'ye
<EOS>
understand

I

"
answered
a
voice
,
"
we
understand

of
course

<EOS>
""Of
course
we
do

"
hiccoughed
another
of
the
party
,
called
Besley
,
on
whom
the
liquor
was
taking
effect
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we

we
does

—
hur

ray!""Well
,
then
,
gentlemen
,
"
resumed
Curdish
—
who
also
began
to
feel
quarrelsome
from
the
same
canse—"it
's
all
right
,
by
St.
Christopher
!
<EOS>
and
blast
me
,
but
I
'll
blow
his
brains—""Hold

<EOS>
cried
Riley
,
interrupting
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
do

<EOS>
Do
you
perticularly
want
to
get
us
all
shot

hey
?
<EOS>
The
cap'en
's
right
about

<EOS>
We
had
n't
no
business

innocent
women

<EOS>
""Hang
me
,
but
we
've
a
right
to
meddle
with
jest

"
rejoined
Curdish
,
with
an
oath
;
"
and
who
says
we
haint
,
is
a
liar
,
and
<EOS>
no

Jack

"
returned
Riley
;
"
but
I
ai
nt
a
-
goin

to
quarrel
with
ye
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""Come
,
come
,
"
said
Saxton
,
interposing
,
"
we
've
enemies
enough
,
without
quarrelling
among
ourselves
;
and
what
's
more
,
Jack
<EOS>
,
you
ought
to
be
the
last
one
to
raise
a
fight
—
seein
'
as
how
we
come
here
at
your
request

<EOS>
You
said
you
'd
got
a
plan
to
lay
afore
us
,
and
we
'd
jest
like
to
know
now
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
reckon
its
putty
soon
got
at
,

returned
Curdish
,
with
a
savage
look
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
more
nor
less
than
what
we
's
talkin

about

night

<EOS>
You
see
that
ar

arm
,
do
n't
ye
?
<EOS>
Well
,
that
ar
'
arm
was
shot
by
a
—
Yankee
,
when
him
and
another
feller
interfered
in
a
scrape
that
perticularly
belonged
to
me
and
Bill
Riley
;
and
what
I
want
's
revenge!—nothing
more
nor
less
than
their
heart
's
blood
,
by

!
"
and
he
closed
with
a
terrible
oath
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
,
Jack
,
you
know
that
's
a
perticularly
dangerous
business
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Riley
,
who
not
having
been
with
the
others
on
the
night
in
question
,
now
learned
of
the
intentions
of
Curdish
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
"'Sposing
<EOS>
'
tis?—by
St.
Christopher
!
<EOS>
who
's
afeared?""The
<EOS>
-
them
's
it

"
<EOS>
hiccoughed
Besley
—
who
was
already
too
far
gone
to
understand
much
of
what
was
said
,
but
who
occasionally
caught
at
a
phrase
and
fancied
he
must
say
something
in
return
:
"
The
-
them
's
it!—who
's
afeared
?
<EOS>
Hurhur
-
ray!""But
,
"
said
Saxton
,
"
what
's
the
plan
,
and
what
's
the
pay
if
we
succeed
?
<EOS>
Ye
see
the
affair
's
an
ugly
one
,
the
best
way
you
can
fix
it
,
Jack
,
and
the
temptation
must
be
good
,
you
know

for
us

gentlemen—""The

it

I

temptation
's
good

hur

hurray
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Bosley
,
who
fancied
the
temptation
somehow
referred
to
drinking
.
<EOS>
"As
to
the
plan
,
"
answered
Curdish
,
"
I
do
n't
know
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
Ye
see
I
haint
no
great
head
for
plans
,
<EOS>
any
how
;
though
John
Webber
's
offered
to
give
me
instruction
how
to
manage
,
provided
I
'll
jest
help
him
in
another
scrape

consarnin
'
that
'
ar

what
we
had
to
do
with
afore

He

to
carry
her
off
this

<EOS>
Blast
me

but
she
's
gittin

quite
pop'ler
<EOS>
somehow
—
ha
,
ha

ha
!
<EOS>
But
about
the
pay
—
that
's
all
right
.
<EOS>
Ye
see
its
'
spected
they
've
got
lots
of
chinkers
about
'em

and

<EOS>
I
want

revenge!""I'm
with
ye

"
<EOS>
cried
Niles
,
with
an
oath
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
in
!
"
returned
Saxton
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
-
them
's
it
!
"
<EOS>
hiccoughed
Besley
:
"
<EOS>
Hurray!""Well
,
all
as
goes
in
this
ere
business
,
will
have
to
help
in
tother
;
that
's
the
perticular
agreement
'
tween
me
and
John
.
<EOS>
What
d'ye
say
,
Bill?""I'll
have
nothin'
to
do
with

t
!
"
answered
Riley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
ar
'
other
scrape
did
me
;
besides
,
you
know
the
cap'en
's
orders—""Hang
the
cap'en
!
<EOS>
"
interrupted
Curdish
,
fiercesposin
'
"
<EOS>
He
need
n't
know
any
thing
about
it
;
and
sposin
<EOS>
'
he
did
,
it
arnt
none
<EOS>
o
'
his
business
!
<EOS>
I
reckon
we
've
got
a
right
to
make
an
honest
livin
'
.
<EOS>
without
askin
'
him
!
<EOS>
If
we
haint
,
why
blast
me
<EOS>
we
'll
make
a
right!""Well
<EOS>
,
I
say
I
'll
have
nothin'
to
do
with
'
it
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Riley
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"Per'aps
<EOS>
you
wants
to
peach
!
"
said
Curdish
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
gittin
'
altogether
over
nice
,
somehow
,
lately
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
know
me
well
enough
on
that
score
,
Jack
,
"
answered
Riley
,
"
to
know
you
're
insiniwatin
'
<EOS>
what
's
base
and
ungentlemanly
;
and
if
I
'd
a
notion
to
quarrel
,
you
'd
have
to
take
back
them
<EOS>
ar
'
words
,
or
one
or
both
on
us
would
be
<EOS>
gittin
'
cold
afore
five
minutes!""Some
folks
ar
'
<EOS>
perticularly
wonderful
smart
in
big
talk
,
"
retorted
Curdish
;
"
but
they
do
n't
skeer—""Come
,
come
,
Jack
,
"
interrupted
Saxton
;
<EOS>
"
I
'll
answer
for
Bill
's
honesty
;
and
if
he
do
n't
want
to
jine
us
,
why
jest
let
him
stay
away
—
the
fewer
<EOS>
the
number
the
greater
the
spoil
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
-
them
's
it
!
"
<EOS>
hiccoughed
Besley
,
again
.
<EOS>
"Thar
's
enough
on
us
,
any
how
,
"
put
in
Niles
;
"
and
I
'm
of
Sax
's
opinion
,
that
if
Bill
do
n't
want
to
jine
,
we
'd
better
jest
let
him
stay
away
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
haint
<EOS>
you
got
no
plan
how
to
go
to
work
?
"
asked
Saxton
.
<EOS>
"Hist
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Riley
,
suddenly
,
bending
his
head
forward
in
a
listening
attitude
:
"
Do
n't
you
hear
a
noise?""The
others
paused
and
listened
also
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
!
"
said
Saxton
,
shortly
.
"Comin
<EOS>
'
fast
!
"
remarked
Riley
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
game
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
wonder?"The
sound
which
at
first
was
rumbling
and
distant
,
now
came
clear
and
distinct
,
and
could
not
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
horse
urged
to
his
greatest
speed
.
<EOS>
A
moment
more
the
blow
of
the
animal
was
audible
to
the
listeners
,
and
the
clatter
of
his
hoofs
had
paused
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Curdish
and
Saxton
turned
a
little
pale
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
's
in
the
wind
!
"
said
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
we
haint
been
betrayed?""I
do
n't
know
,
"
answered
Curdish
,
"
unless
it
's
John
Webber
.
<EOS>
Nobody
else
knew
any
thing
about
our
comin
'
here
,
unless
Hetty"—here
<EOS>
he
cast
a
fierce
look
on
the
hostess
,
who
catching
the
expression
,
quickly
made
answer:"D'ye
spose
<EOS>
I
'd
peach
,
Jack
Curdish?""Not
and
live
!
"
<EOS>
growled
Curdish
,
with
an
oath
.
<EOS>
"It
's
only
one
,
any
how
,
"
said
Saxton
,
looking
to
the
pistols
in
his
belt
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
knock
was
heard
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
"Who
's
thar
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Hetty
,
in
a
shrill
voice
.
<EOS>
"Ele
<EOS>
lio
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"Blast
<EOS>
me
,
but
<EOS>
it
's
John
Webber
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Curdish
.
<EOS>
"
I
knows
the
voice
.
<EOS>
Ye
need
n't
fear
,
Hetty
;
open
the
door!"Hetty
immediately
complied
,
and
true
to
the
suggestion
of
Curdish
,
John
Webber
entered
.
<EOS>
—
There
was
a
lurking
devil
in
his
eye
,
if
we
may
be
allowed
an
old
expression
,
as
he
scanned
with
a
rapid
glance
both
the
apartment
and
its
occupants
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
that
eye
too
,
that
forbade
familiarity
,
which
each
of
the
party
—
for
all
they
knew
him
to
be
one
of
their
band
,
and
believed
him
as
great
a
villian
as
themselves
—
felt
;
<EOS>
a
something
that
awed
them
to
a
certain
respect
,
(
a
sort
of
devilish
mental
superiority
)
which
John
—
who
was
no
novice
in
reading
the
thoughts
of
kindred
spirits
—
perceived
;
and
for
a
moment
that
dark
smile
lingered
on
his
features
.
<EOS>
"We
's
<EOS>
jest
talkin
'
about
you
,
"
remarked
Curdish
,
who
was
the
first
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
They
say
talk
about
the
devil—""Well
?
"
interupted
John
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"O
,
nothing
,
"
added
Curdish
,
who
somehow
fancied
it
would
not
be
politic
to
finish
the
sentence
.
<EOS>
"You
were
talking
about
me
,
then
!
<EOS>
"
said
John
,
with
a
stern
look
:
"
<EOS>
Well?""Yes
,
we
's
jest
mentioning
over
that
ar
'
business
,
you
know
,
about
how
'
twas
best
to
git
at
them
<EOS>
ar
<EOS>
'
fellers
,
ye
see
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
I
know
and
see
!
"
<EOS>
returned
John
,
quickly
;
"
and
will
add
,
that
the
chance
you
are
looking
for
will
come
sooner
and
in
a
different
manner
than
you
expect
.
<EOS>
"Several
of
the
party
started
with
looks
of
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Curdish—"thar
's
some
meaning
in
that!""I
never
speak
without
meaning
!
"
returned
John
,
emphasizing
the
last
word
.
<EOS>
"What
's
in
the
wind
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Saxton
.
<EOS>
"Hark
ye
,
fellows
!
"
<EOS>
answered
John
;
"
before
I
proceed
farther
,
there
must
be
an
understanding
.
<EOS>
I
am
aware
,
and
doubtless
you
are
also
—
if
not
you
should
be
—
that
there
are
no
ties
of
friendship
between
us
.
<EOS>
We
are
drawn
together
and
act
together
only
so
far
as
our
separate
interests
make
it
necessary
.
<EOS>
Whatever
those
interests
are
,
matters
not
;
suffice
that
they
are
enough
for
our
present
union
.
<EOS>
To
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
I
am
willing
to
serve
you
,
so
far
as
lies
in
my
power
,
but
you
must
serve
me
in
return
!
<EOS>
Is
this
the
understanding?""Ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Curdish
,
Saxton
,
Niles
and
Besley
—
the
last
of
whom
,
by
the
way
,
owing
doubtless
to
the
turn
matters
had
taken
,
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
understand
what
was
going
forward
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
one
of
your
party
does
not
answer
,
"
remarked
John
,
glancing
at
Riley
.
<EOS>
"I've
told
'em
afore
,
I
'd
have
nothin'
to
do
with't
!
"
said
Riley
.
<EOS>
John
put
his
mouth
to
the
ear
of
Curdish
,
and
whispered
:
"
Can
he
be
trusted?""I'll
answer
for
him
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Curdish
,
in
a
whisper
also
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
Hetty?""She
's
right!""Enough
!
<EOS>
"
said
John
,
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Those
of
you
who
are
willing
to
enter
into
an
agreement
to
serve
me
,
when
called
upon
,
for
the
service
I
shall
render
you
,
will
now
swear
to
do
so
by
kissing
this
dagger
.
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
drew
from
his
breast
a
long
,
polished
weapon
,
of
the
kind
named
,
and
reached
it
to
Curdish
,
who
took
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Saxton
,
Niles
,
and
Besley
did
the
same
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
all
now
deliberately
sworn
!
"
resumed
John
,
as
he
again
took
the
weapon
.
"
<EOS>
Now
mark
me
,
fellows
!
"
<EOS>
continued
he
,
with
a
cold
,
stern
look
,
compressing
his
lips
and
speaking
through
his
clenched
teeth
:
"
I
never
trifle
myself
,
and
will
not
be
trifled
with
!
<EOS>
Whoever
among
you
shall
dare
wilfully
,
to
break
his
oath
,
by
that
dread
eternity
before
us
!
<EOS>
I
swear
he
shall
stain
this
steel
with
his
heart
's
blood
!
"
<EOS>
and
giving
it
a
flourish
,
so
that
it
sparkled
in
the
light
,
he
returned
it
to
its
sheath
,
while
the
others
gazed
upon
him
in
silence
with
an
awe
they
had
seldom
or
never
felt
before
in
the
presence
of
any
human
being
.
<EOS>
Villains
though
they
were
—
dark
,
treacherous
villains
<EOS>
—
they
inwardly
acknowledged
John
Webber
their
master
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
this
escape
his
piercing
eyes
;
and
<EOS>
with
that
devilish
smile
playing
for
a
moment
on
his
features
,
he
again
resumed:"I
see
you
understand
me
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
Now
to
business
.
<EOS>
I
accidentally
overheard
a
conversation
this
evening
which
concerns
you
all
.
<EOS>
A
project
is
under
way
to
seize
upon
the
person
of
Hetty
,
here
,
early
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
""What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
screamed
Hetty
,
who
had
been
listening
attentively
,
while
the
others
started
with
looks
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
"Peace
,
woman
!
<EOS>
"
said
John
,
sternly
,
"
and
listen
!
<EOS>
Their
object
in
seizing
her
is
to
force
her
to
tell
all
she
knows
concerning
that
kidnapping
affair
,
who
were
the
instigators
and
actors
in
it
,
and
also
where
they
may
be
found
,
which
mayhap
concerns
some
of
you
especially
—
I
know
not
but
all
.
<EOS>
""By
St.
Christopher
!
"
exclaimed
Curdish
,
springing
to
his
feet
:
"
I—""Hold
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
,
fiercely
;
"
I
have
no
time
to
dally
,
so
do
not
interrupt
me
again
!
<EOS>
The
party
for
this
business
consists
of
three,—two
of
them
are
the
men
you
seek
,
the
third
is
my
father
.
<EOS>
By
knowing
their
intentions
beforehand
,
you
will
be
able
to
mature
plans
to
your
liking
,
with
which
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
This
much
,
however
,
must
be
borne
in
mind
!
<EOS>
Of
the
two
with
my
father
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
—
you
will
deal
with
them
as
you
see
proper
;
but
with
regard
to
my
father
himself
,
understand
me:—Not
<EOS>
a
hair
of
his
head
must
be
harmed
!
<EOS>
Secure
him
if
you
can
,
from
doing
you
violence
,
but
raise
not
a
weapon
against
him
!
<EOS>
Understand
me
further:—Should
<EOS>
he
be
harmed
,
I
will
know
who
harmed
him
;
and
by
that
Heaven
above
,
and
that
Hell
beneath
us
!
<EOS>
I
swear
,
him
<EOS>
will
I
pursue
till
his
corse
lies
cold
beneath
my
feet
!
"
and
the
aspect
of
his
features
as
he
spoke
,
was
terrible
;
so
much
so
that
those
very
ruffians
,
bred
in
crime
,
felt
a
sense
of
secret
<EOS>
fear,—even
as
a
wild
,
savage
beast
has
been
known
to
tremble
before
the
awful
majesty
of
the
eye
and
mind
of
his
superior
,
man
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
after
John
spoke
all
was
silent
,
when
he
again
added
:
"
I
think
our
business
for
the
present
is
settled
.
<EOS>
When
your
services
are
required
,
you
will
be
informed
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
time
to
tarry
,
and
so
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Turning
away
,
as
he
spoke
,
he
abruptly
disappeared
,
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
swiftly
away
,
but
in
an
opposite
direction
whence
he
came
.
<EOS>
"Blast
<EOS>
me
,
what
a
look
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
first
exclamation
after
the
departure
of
John
,
which
proceeded
from
Curdish
.
<EOS>
"Never
<EOS>
saw
the
like
on't
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Niles
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
I
!
"
added
Saxton
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
I
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Besley
.
<EOS>
"'Twarnt
human
!
"
<EOS>
put
in
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
comrades
,
"
said
Riley
,
who
was
the
last
to
speak
,
"
it
was
devilish
enough
,
and
no
mistake
;
but
if
I
arnt
mistaken
,
you
've
got
other
matters
to
think
on
.
<EOS>
I
've
said
all
along
I
'd
have
nothin'
to
do
with't
,
when
you
talked
about
attacking
others
;
but
since
we
're
agoin
'
to
be
attacked
ourselves
,
I
arnt
one
as
will
flinch
;
so
you
may
jest
put
me
down
on
the
defence
,
though
somehow
I
've
got
a
presentiment
it
'll
be
my
last
undertakin'!""Good
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Curdish
.
<EOS>
"
I
jest
knowed
as
how
you
'd
come
up
trump
,
Bill
.
<EOS>
More
licker
,
Hetty
,
and
then
by
St.
Christopher
<EOS>
we
'll
lay
our
plans!"Whatever
<EOS>
those
plans
were
,
our
story
itself
in
its
progress
must
alone
develope
.

CHAPTER
II.THE
JEW
—
THE
PLAN
OF
REVENGE
—
<EOS>
THE
PAPERS
—
THE
PRISONER
—
THE
STRANGER
—
<EOS>
THE
SPY.On
that
same
night
old
<EOS>
David
<EOS>
the
Jew
sat
alone
in
the
hovel
wherein
we
first
introduced
him
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
His
features
bore
the
same
coarse
,
villainous
,
repulsive
aspect
as
then
,
and
the
apartment
the
same
dirty
,
gloomy
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
,
as
then
,
sat
by
a
sort
of
rough
table
,
whereon
stood
a
pale
,
sickly
light
of
his
own
construction
—
<EOS>
his
elbow
inclined
downward
and
resting
on
it
so
as
to
support
his
head
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
—
The
light
stood
some
little
distance
before
him
,
and
its
pale
gleam
fell
on
a
countenance
where
all
the
worst
passions
of
the
human
heart
were
manifesting
themselves
by
sudden
and
sometimes
awful
contortions
of
the
muscles
.
<EOS>
Now
a
heavy
frown
would
gather
over
his
features
,
like
some
black
,
portentous
cloud
over
a
dismal
swamp
,
and
his
small
black
eyes
would
look
cold
and
devilish
,
and
his
shrivelled
bloodless
lips
would
compress
,
and
his
lower
jaw
move
as
though
he
were
endeavoring
to
grate
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
Now
the
expression
would
take
a
wilder
,
fiercer
and
more
fiend
-
like
aspect
,
and
his
eyes
would
sparkle
with
a
strange
and
terrible
gleam
,
and
his
thin
,
bony
hand
would
clutch
at
the
air
,
as
though
he
felt
it
were
at
the
throat
of
some
victim
of
his
undying
hate
.
<EOS>
And
thus
he
sat
,
for
an
hour
,
buried
to
the
outer
world
in
the
gloom
of
his
own
dark
,
guilty
thoughts
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
—
motionless
,
save
the
nervous
agitations
we
have
described
—
alone
—
an
old
,
grey
headed
man
—
<EOS>
a
sad
and
revolting
picture
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
who
would
wish
to
enter
to
the
depths
of
such
a
soul
and
see
its
awful
workings
,
where
no
ray
of
God
's
sunshine
ever
entered
?
<EOS>
Better
be
in
the
dark
,
cold
and
cheerless
charnal
house
,
among
the
mouldering
remnants
of
mortality!Thus
,
as
we
have
said
,
for
an
hour
sat
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
started
to
his
feet
,
and
with
his
old
frame
shaking
with
age
and
debility
,
commenced
shuffling
to
and
fro
the
apartment
,
with
his
head
bent
forward
,
and
his
trembling
hands
locked
in
each
other
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
paused
,
and
reaching
forth
his
clenched
hand
,
shook
it
as
it
were
at
vacancy
,
while
his
countenance
assumed
that
same
fierce
,
terrible
expression
.
"Revenge
!
<EOS>
"
hissed
he
,
at
last
,
through
his
pale
quivering
lips
:
"
Revenge

<EOS>

he
again
commenced
shuffling
across
the
apartment
,
but
shortly
paused
and
again
resumed:"I

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
the
old
Jew
,
as
though
the
consummation
of
his
design
had
already
taken
place
,
chuckled
with
a
glee
that
partook
more
of
the
nature
of
a
fiend
than
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
Again
he
resumed:"Yish

takes

"
<EOS>
and
the
old
Jew
rubbed
together
his
hands
,
and
chuckled
merrily
until
a
severe
cough
interrupted
him
.
<EOS>
"Vell
,
now
I
shall
looks
to
mine
monish
,
"
said
he
,
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
speak
;
"
and
mine
papers
too
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
"
cried
he
,
starting
as
though
some
new
thought
had
come
over
him
suddenly
:
"
De
papers
!
<EOS>
yish
,

<EOS>

and
den
<EOS>
I
shall
haves
plenty
of

—
ha
,
ha!—plenty
of
monish
;
"
and
again
the
old
Jew
rubbed
his
bony
hands
together
and
chuckled
.
<EOS>
Glancing
cautiously
around
,
as
though
to
assure
himself
no
other
being
was
present
,
although
he
knew
the
outer
door
was
strongly
bolted
,
and
felt
perfectly
confident
he
was
alone
,
(
such
by
the
way
being
the
force
of
habit
)
he
proceeded
to
the
closet
we
have
before
had
occasion
to
notice
as
occupying
one
corner
of
the
apartment
,
and
for
a
moment
disappeared
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
for
a
moment
however
;
and
when
he
returned
,
he
bore
in
one
hand
a
roll
of
papers
,
and
in
the
other
a
bag
of
money
.
<EOS>
Approaching
with
a
feeble
step
he
deposited
both
on
the
table
,
and
then
reseated
himself
on
the
old
stool
.
<EOS>
Untying
the
bag
he
poured
forth
its
contents
,
and
then
for
a
few
minutes
sat
and
gazed
upon
the
pile
with
the
exulting
,
avaricious
look
of
a
miser
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
in
a
measure
was
excusable
;
for
the
pile
,
to
say
the
truth
,
was
by
no
means
an
invaluable
one
,
and
might
have
tempted
others
of
a
less
avaricious
nature
than
the
Jew
to
eye
it
with
delight
.
<EOS>
It
was
mostly
of
gold
—
old
genuine
coins
—
many
of
them
Spanish
doubloons
,
English
guineas
,
and
the
like
<EOS>
—
occasionally
interspersed
with
a
few
pieces
of
silver
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
,
we
say
,
the
old
Jew
sat
and
gazed
upon
his
treasure
,
and
then
commenced
handling
each
piece
separately
,
with
a
childish
delight
—
placing
each
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
or
on
the
end
of
his
fingers
,
and
then
moving
his
hand
up
and
down
as
though
to
ascertain
its
weight
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
passed
another
hour
—
perhaps
more
—
when
he
returned
the
money
piece
by
piece
to
the
bag
,
taking
due
note
of
the
exact
amount
that
none
might
be
missing
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
and
the
whole
secured
by
the
string
,
he
laid
it
gently
upon
the
table
,
took
up
the
papers
,
unrolled
and
examined
them
attentively
for
some
half
hour
more
;
when
,
as
if
satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
,
he
rolled
them
together
,
and
gathering
up
his
money
returned
again
to
the
closet
.
<EOS>
Here
,
feeling
along
the
side
next
to
the
wall
,
low
down
,
he
came
to
a
kind
of
panel
,
when
touching
a
secret
spring
it
immediately
flew
open
,
disclosing
a
small
iron
door
.
<EOS>
Touching
another
spring
,
this
door
opened
,
leaving
an
aperture
into
a
small
iron
safe
,
where
the
Jew
quickly
deposited
his
money
and
papers
,
and
then
reclosed
both
the
safe
door
and
panel
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
was
this
completed
,
when
a
deep
sepulchral
groan
seemed
to
issue
from
beneath
him
.
"Ha
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
starting
<EOS>
,
"
I
had
forgot
mine
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Vell
,
vot
fors
<EOS>
should
I
keeps
him
longers
?
<EOS>
Vot

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
No
,
he
will
pe
no
more
use
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
mine
papers
,
and
mine
monish
,
and
shall
come
pack
no
mores
.
<EOS>
Vell
,

<EOS>
Yish

<EOS>
he

<EOS>
and
den
he
will
tells
no

on

old
Jew
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
yish
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
dat
ish
rights
—
he
shall
dies
!
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
old
Jew
tottered
back
to
the
table
,
with
a
savage
look
on
his
grim
,
ugly
features
—
a
hellish
gleam
in
his
small
black
eyes
—
and
taking
up
the
light
returned
once
more
to
the
closet
.
<EOS>
Here
he
paused
,
and
taking
from
a
narrow
shelf
a
somewhat
rusty
dagger
,
he
examined
it
attentively
for
a
moment
,
with
a
fierce
gleam
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
Dat
shall
do
mine
pusiness
,
"
he
muttered
;
and
raising
a
trap
-
door
near
his
feet
,
he
slowly
commenced
his
descent
down
a
damp
,
mildewed
ladder
,
into
a
slimy
,
nauseous
vault
,
bearing
the
light
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
passage
which
the
Jew
descended
was
very
narrow
,
and
was
walled
up
on
either
hand
to
prevent
the
earth
from
caving
in
.
<EOS>
In
depth
it
might
have
been
some
fifteen
feet
,
and
in
extent
some
thirty
more
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
cold
,
for
both
the
ground
and
walls
were
moist
;
and
on
the
latter
stood
large
drops
,
which
glistened
as
the
pale
gleam
of
the
light
fell
upon
them
,
like
the
eyes
of
so
many
serpents
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
by
no
means
its
worst
feature
.
<EOS>
The
air
,
though
cold
,
was
close
and
heavy
;
so
much
so
as
to
be
difficult
of
respiration
;
and
was
,
besides
,
filled
with
a
stench
almost
insupportable
.
<EOS>
At
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
the
Jew
for
a
moment
paused
—
with
his
feet
sliding
upon
what
seemed
greasy
earth
—
and
then
turning
slowly
around
,
moved
cautiously
along
the
passage
,
with
the
light
held
before
him
in
one
hand
,
and
the
dagger
in
the
other
,
occasionally
resting
an
arm
against
the
walls
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
,
until
he
came
to
the
terminus
,
where
was
revealed
a
spectacle
of
the
most
piteous
,
revolting
,
and
inhuman
nature
.
<EOS>
On
a
bed
of
damp
,
filthy
straw
—
ground
into
the
earth
until
it
was
completely
coated
with
a
clayey
loam
,
and
chained
to
the
wall
—
lay
the
thin
,
sickly
,
wasted
figure
of
what
had
once
been
a
powerful
man
,
now
passed
the
middle
age
of
life
.
<EOS>
He
was
scarcely
more
than
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
His
once
strongly
marked
countenance
—
now
of
a
pale
livid
,
ghastly
hue
—
had
wasted
away
until
every
bone
stood
prominent
.
<EOS>
His
cheeks
had
fallen
in
;
and
his
large
,
dark
eyes,—as
they
rolled
in
their
hollow
,
bony
sockets
,
and
gleamed
out
from
between
his
long
,
grey
,
matted
,
dirty
hair
,
which
partly
screened
his
features
—
were
sepulchral
and
awful
to
behold
.
<EOS>
His
limbs
and
body
were
but
partially
covered
by
rags
of
the
most
filthy
description
,
while
—
as
if
to
complete
the
foulest
picture
of
human
wretchedness
imaginable
—
rusty
iron
chains
,
fastened
around
his
ankles
,
clanked
to
the
move
of
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
prisoner
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
awfully
loathsome
,
heart
sickening
sight
,
which
he
now
gazed
upon
with
a
savage
joy
.
<EOS>
—
Such
was
the
scene
before
him
;
but
worse
—
ay
,
worse
—
for
we
dare
not
describe
it
as
it
was
in
reality
.
<EOS>
It
would
shock
the
senses
.
<EOS>
And
who
was
this
man
?
<EOS>
and
how
came
he
there
in
the
power
of
the
Jew
?
<EOS>
Let
the
sequel
of
our
story
answer
.
<EOS>
As
the
prisoner
saw
the
Jew
approaching
,
he
partly
raised
himself
on
one
arm
and
groaned
.
<EOS>
As
the
Jew
paused
before
him
,
with
a
dagger
in
his
hand
,
and
murder
in
his
eye
,
the
prisoner
groaned
again
;
and
then
in
a
deep
,
hollow
voice
,
said:"Oh
,
or
God
-
sake
,
give
me
food
!
<EOS>
I
am
dying
—
I
am
dying
of
starvation
!
<EOS>
Days
I
know
have
passed
since
I
have
seen
you
—
since
aught
has
passed
these
lips
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
wretched
man
sunk
back
upon
his
wretched
bed
with
a
second
groan
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
the
Jew
returned
no
answer
,
but
stood
and
gazed
upon
him
with
a
fiendish
smile
.
<EOS>
Then
he
lookod
at
his
dagger
,
and
then
he
spoke:"You
<EOS>
shall
shee
me
no
more
nevers
.
<EOS>
You
shall
gets
no
more
foods
.
<EOS>
I
shall
kills
you
.
<EOS>
You
shall
dies
mid
mine
daggers
.
<EOS>
I
am

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
The

and
vot
for
<EOS>
should
you
lives
?
<EOS>
No
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
you
shall
dies
!
"
<EOS>
The
Jew
spoke
rapidly
,
in
short
sentences
,
and
as
he
concluded
he
raised
his
weapon
and
bent
forward
in
an
attitude
to
strike
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
spare
me
!
<EOS>
for
God
-
sake
,
spare
me
!
<EOS>
release
me
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
victim
,
glaring
wildly
upon
him
:
"
I
am
not
ready
to
die
now
.
<EOS>
""He
,
he
,
he
!
chuckled
the
Jew
,
with
a
hideous
grin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vot
for
you
tinks
<EOS>
I
shall
spares
you
?
—
<EOS>
You

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Shall

?
<EOS>
No
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
you

<EOS>
You
shall

!
"
and
placing
one
knee
on
the
ground
as
he
spoke
,
he
again
raised
the
dagger
,
bent
himself
forward
,
and
with
a
rapid
motion
struck
at
the
heart
of
his
victim
.
<EOS>
But
he
failed
of
his
mark
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
who
had
been
watching
him
intently
,
gathered
all
his
remaining
strength
for
a
final
effort
,
marked
the
blow
as
it
descended
,
caught
his
arm
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
wrenched
the
weapon
from
him
.
<EOS>
So
sudden
and
so
unexpected
was
this
,
that
the
Jew
started
to
his
feet
and
retreated
some
paces
in
absolute
terror
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
he
comprehended
all
,
and
saw
how
his
victim
had
foiled
him
,
he
uttered
a
volley
of
curses
at
his
own
stupidity
,
stamped
the
earth
with
his
foot
,
and
beat
his
head
with
his
clenched
hand
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
.
<EOS>
What
might
have
been
the
result
—
what
dark
and
inhuman
revenge
he
might
have
taken
on
the
unhappy
object
before
him
—
had
nothing
occurred
to
interrupt
and
draw
off
his
thoughts
<EOS>
—
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
just
at
this
instant
was
heard
a
noise
,
like
the
quick
tramp
of
a
horse
,
and
immediately
followed
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
above
.
<EOS>
As
the
Jew
heard
this
,
he
started
,
turned
pale
—
<EOS>
that
is
as
pale
as
his
brown
,
dirt
-
begrimed
features
would
permit
—
and
trembled
in
every
limb
.
<EOS>
Again
the
knocking
was
renewed
,
even
louder
than
before
,
and
not
daring
to
pause
longer
he
turned
and
made
haste
up
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
At
the
top
he
paused
to
reclose
the
door
of
the
vault
,
and
then
tottering
into
the
larger
apartment
placed
the
light
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
he
was
still
more
startled
by
hearing
a
deep
,
heavy
voice
say:"Open
this
door
,
or
I
will
burst
it
from
its
fastenings!""Who
ish
dare
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Jew
,
in
a
trembling
voice
.
<EOS>
"Ele
<EOS>
lio
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
,
though
still
frightened
,
felt
much
re
lieved
by
this
,
as
it
proved
the
person
,
whoever
he
was
,
to
be
one
of
the
banditti
;
and
shuffling
to
the
door
,
he
quickly
withdrew
the
bolts
and
admitted
a
tall
figure
,
whose
features
were
completely
concealed
under
a
black
mask
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
without
ceremony
,
walked
directly
into
the
middle
of
the
apartment
,
and
then
drawing
from
his
breast
a
long
,
polished
dagger
,
turned
quickly
round
and
abruptly
accosted
the
Jew
,
who
stood
with
his
hand
still
upon
the
door
,
a
perfect
picture
of
cowardly
fright
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
forward
,
Jew
;
I
have
a
few
words
to
say
,
and
but
little
time
to
say
them
in
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Jew
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"Must
<EOS>
I
force
you
to
obey
me
?
"
said
the
stranger
,
with
a
menacing
gesture
,
stamping
his
foot
fiercely
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
,
too
frightened
to
speak
,
reluctantly
complied
.
<EOS>
"You
are
an
old
man
,
Jew
,
"
continued
the
stranger
,
"
and
a
man
of
crime
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
that
convinces
me
there
is
a
Hell
in
the
future
world
,
is
in
gazing
upon
such
a
being
as
you
—
for
who
would
suppose
that
you
could
ever
inhabit
Heaven
?
<EOS>
But
enough
of
that
:
I
am
no
moralist
,
and
only
preach
what
I
practice
.
<EOS>
My
business
here
is
of
a
different
nature
,
and
quickly
told
.
<EOS>
—
You
have
in
your
possession
certain
papers
,
relating
to
a
certain
young
lady
,
whom
you
know
,
but
whose
name
it
is
unnecessary
to
mention
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
for
these
papers
.
<EOS>
""Me
haves
papers
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Jew
,
in
pretended
astonishment
:
"
I
haves
no
papers
.
<EOS>
""You
will
oblige
me
by
getting
them
as
soon
as
possible
,
"
returned
the
stranger
,
cooly
,
not
heeding
the
Jew
's
remark
,
"
as
I
have
but
little
time
to
tarry
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
tells
you
I
haves
no
papers
!
"
repeated
the
Jew
.
"Sorry
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
other
,
carelessly
feeling
of
the
point
of
the
dagger
still
held
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Sorry
you
have
not
got
them
,
Jew
,
as
I
shall
be
much
disappointed
.
<EOS>
""Vell
,
I
swears
to
you
I
haves
not
one
papers
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
Jew
,
feeling
somewhat
reassured
at
the
mild
tone
in
which
the
other
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
did
haves
papers
I
should
gives
thems
to
you
mid
pleasures
.
<EOS>
""How
far
below
the
surface
<EOS>
do
you
think
the
centre
of
an
honest
man
's
heart
lies
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
stranger
,
abruptly
.
<EOS>
"Vell
,
how
you
tinks
<EOS>
I
knows
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
Jew
,
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vot
fors
you
shays
<EOS>
dat?""Because
<EOS>
I
thought
it
likely
you
might
know
,
having
measured
the
distance
often
with
your
dagger
!
"
rejoined
the
other
,
still
toying
with
his
own
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
ish
vons
very
strange
beings
!
"
remarked
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
"As
you
do
not
know
,
"
resumed
the
stranger
,
"
how
far
the
distance
to
the
centre
of
an
honest
man
's
heart
,
how
far
do
you
judge
it
to
be
to
the
centre
of
your
own?""Eh
!
<EOS>
vot
fors
<EOS>
you
shays
dat
<EOS>
?
"
repeated
the
Jew
in
alarm
,
who
now
began
to
fancy
there
was
an
under
current
to
the
other
's
interrogations
.
<EOS>
"O
,
I
merely
enquired
,
"
replied
the
stranger
,
"
that
I
might
know
how
much
of
this
bright
steel
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
stain
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
mine
Gott
!
"
cried
the
Jew
,
shaking
with
fear
:
"
you
vills
not
kills
me?""Why
not
?
"
said
the
stranger
,
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
not
done
such
deeds
often
,
and
on
younger
men
—
men
too
whose
lives
were
valuable
to
society
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
spare
you
?
<EOS>
You
are
old
,
and
have
lived
long
enough
;
besides
,
would
I
not
be
benefitting
society
by
sending
you
to
your
last
account?""Oh
!
<EOS>
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
you
vills
not
kills
me
?
"
repeated
the
Jew
,
sinking
upon
his
knees
,
and
extending
his
shrivelled
old
hands
in
supplication
.
<EOS>
"Kill
you
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
other
fiercely
,
grasping
him
by
the
arm
,
and
raising
his
long
glittering
steel
:
"
Kill
you
!
<EOS>
ay
,
as
I
would
a
copper
snake
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
<EOS>
oh
,
oh
!
"
shrieked
the
Jew
,
who
now
believed
his
last
hour
had
come
.
"
<EOS>
Spares
me
—
spares
me
—
spares
me
!
<EOS>
and
you
shall
haves
monish
—
you
shall
haves
gold
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
oh
!
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
mine
Gott!""Money
!
"
returned
the
stranger
,
contemptuously
:
"
I
do
not
seek
your
money
:
your
blood
stained
coins
I
do
not
want
,
for
a
curse
is
on
them
.
<EOS>
There
is
but
one
consideration
for
which
I
would
spare
your
life
,
and
that
is
not
in
your
power
to
grant
;
at
least
so
you
have
sworn
,
and
of
course
you
would
not
swear
falsely
.
<EOS>
""O
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
yish
,
de
papers
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
Jew
,
with
a
ray
of
hope
breaking
in
upon
him
.
—
"
O
,
yish
,
Mistoor
Strangers
,
mine
Gott
!
<EOS>
yish
,
you
shall
haves

<EOS>
""O
,
then
you
did
swear
falsely
,
eh
?
<EOS>
and
you
really
have
the
papers
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
other
,
releasing
his
hold
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
lucky
you
thought
of
it
in
time
.
<EOS>
Up
,
then
,
and
get
them
—
for
I
am
in
haste
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
you
vills
not
takes—""Up
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
interrupted
the
stranger
,
fiercely
,
stamping
his
foot
violently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Up
I
say
,
quickly
!
<EOS>
or
by
—
!
<EOS>
you
rise
no
more
.
<EOS>
Quick
now
,
the
papers
!
<EOS>
"
added
he
,
as
the
Jew
started
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
David
,
who
saw
there
was
no
middle
course
,
turned
away
with
a
groan
to
obey
the
order
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Proceeding
to
the
safe
,
he
drew
forth
the
papers
,
returned
and
gave
them
to
the
stranger
,
with
a
sigh
and
a
mental
curse
.
<EOS>
Turning
to
the
light
,
the
figure
in
the
mask
examined
them
for
a
moment
with
evident
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
:
"
there
has
been
foul
play
here
,
Jew
;
but
I
have
no
time
to
enquire
into
it
now
—
another
time
will
do
;
"
and
rolling
them
together
as
he
spoke
,
without
another
word
he
turned
and
quitted
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
A
moment
later
the
tramp
of
a
horse
was
heard
speeding
westward
.
<EOS>
That
horse
bore
a
rider
—
that
rider
was
John
Webber
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
delay
to
picture
the
rage
of
the
Jew
,
when
he
found
he
had
again
been
imposed
upon
—
again
been
foiled
in
another
of
his
schemes
;
suffice
that
he
cursed
,
raved
,
stamped
,
and
beat
his
head
like
a
madman
.
<EOS>
Thirsting
for
revenge
on
the
banditti
,
whom
he
now
looked
upon
as
enemies
,
and
thinking
his
movoments
less
likely
to
be
observed
if
done
in
the
night
,
he
determined
to
start
for
St.
Louis
,
and
early
on
the
morrow
betray
the
band
and
seek
for
protection
under
the
law
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
took
his
money
,
the
only
thing
valuable
he
could
carry
with
him
,
and
within
an
hour
from
the
departure
of
John
,
set
forth
on
his
treacherous
mission
.
<EOS>
Engrossed
by
his
wild
thoughts
of
revenge
,
his
prisoner
had
been
forgotten
.
<EOS>
As
the
Jew
quitted
the
hovel
,
a
dark
,
crooked
object
came
out
from
beneath
the
table
—
straightened
itself
into
the
tall
figure
of
a
man
—
opened
the
door
softly
,
and
disappeared
after
him
.
<EOS>
Who
was
that
figure
?
<EOS>
how
came
he
there
?
<EOS>
and
for
what
purpose
?
<EOS>
Did
the
Jew
reach
St.
Louis
that
night
?
<EOS>
Did
he
ever
reach
<EOS>
St.
Louis?Who

THE

<EOS>
the
morning
<EOS>
following
that
night
of
events
,
the
sun
rose
in
splendor
,
and
as
his
golden
rays
rested
upon
the
ridge
where
our
story
first
opened
,
they
occasionally
,
from
between
the
branches
of
the
surrounding
trees
,
fell
with
a
mellow
gleam
upon
three
figures
,
well
mounted
on
three
noble
steeds
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
three
were
large
,
powerful
men
,
while
the
third
,
well
formed
,
full
of
grace
and
activity
,
was
by
no
means
an
inferior
individual
.
<EOS>
Each
of
the
party
was
well
armed
,
with
two
pistols
,
a
long
hunting
knife
,
and
a
rifle
slung
behind
him
,
across
his
shoulders
,
ready
for
immediate
use
when
necessary
.
<EOS>
That
they
had
ridden
fast
was
evident
from
the
expanded
nostrils
and
foaming
breasts
of
the
animals
beneath
them
;
but
at
the
moment
introduced
their
speed
was
only
a
fast
walk
,
and
they
were
gazing
in
various
directions
upon
the
beautiful
scenery
around
with
seeming
delight
.
<EOS>
"This
ere
's
a
putty
considerable
kind
o
'
a
country
of
yourn
,
Bill
Webber
,
"
remarked
Bernard
,
at
length
—
for
the
reader
has
doubtless
recognised
the
three
horsemen
as
Webber
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone:—"a
putty
<EOS>
considerable

I
swow
,

's

n't

<EOS>

Mark
?
<EOS>
Howsomever
,
I
seed
it
when
I
's
out
here
<EOS>
afore"—continued
<EOS>
he
,
without
waiting
for
a
reply
from
Tyrone
—
"
so
twasn't
exactly
new
to
me
,
though
I
looked
on't
with
jest
about
the
same
satisfaction
as
I
did
at
first
.
<EOS>
Mark
,
here
,

he

<EOS>
""Pshaw

<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Tyrone
,
who
was
not
particularly
fond
of
a
joke
;
"
you
always
exaggerate
,
Harvey
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
I
thought
it
a
great
stream
,
and
in
that
opinion
I
am
borne
out
by
geographical
facts
,
which
prove
it
one
of
the
first
in
the
world
,
but
I
did
not
mistake
it
for
the
ocean
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
""O
<EOS>
you
need
n't
try
to
creep
out
on't
now
,
Mark
;
it
's
all

swow

"
<EOS>
said
Bernard
,
casting
a
side
glance
at
Webber
,
who
smiled
and
changed
the
conversation
by
saying:"I
<EOS>
suppose
we
are
near
the
cave
you
mentioned
,
<EOS>
Harvey?""Right
<EOS>
down
there
's
the
spot
,
"
he
replied
pointing
to
the
right,—"where
you
see
them
are
stones
<EOS>
all
jumbled
up
together
,
jest
as
if
they
did
n't
care
'bout
how
they
looked
.
<EOS>
""I
remember
the
place
now
,
very
well
,
"
returned
Webber
;
"
for
only
a
short
time
since
a
man
was
supposed
to
have
been
murdered
there
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Tyrone
,
with
interest
:
"
happened
it
very
lately?""About
four
months
since
,
"
answered
Webber
.
<EOS>
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
Why
you
did
not
mention
this
before
,
to
my
recollection
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
fact
<EOS>
I
had
forgotten
it
,
"
said
Webber
,
in
reply
;
"
such
things
being
too
common
in
this
country
to
live
long
in
memory
,
unless
the
individual
be
well
known

and
this
one
was
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
known
for
a
certainty
that
he
was
murdered
,
but
circumstances
place
it
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
A
man
somewhat
past
the
middle
age
was
seen
in
this
vicinity
during
the
day
,
and
the
night
succeeding
one
of
my
neighbors
heard
a
shriek
and
cry
for
help
,
proceeding
as
near
as
he
could
judge
from
yonder
cave
;
but
being
unarmed
and
alone
<EOS>
he
dared
not
go
to
the
rescue
;
the
more
so
,
as
he
believed
there
would
be
more
than
one
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
A
search
wasinstituted
the
day
following
,
but
save
some
marks
of
blood
in
and
about
the
cave
,
nothing
was
discovered
of
importance
.
<EOS>
As
the
stranger
has
never
been
seen
since
,
it
is
believed
that
he
was
attacked
by
ruffians
,
murdered
for
his
money
,
and
his
body
sunk
in
the
Maramee
.
<EOS>
It
was
thought
by
many
that
the
old
Jew
could
tell
something
of
the
matter
if
so
disposed
;
and
now
I
think
of
it
,
doubtless
these
same
kidnappers
were
concerned
also
.
<EOS>
""Such
is
my
opinion
from
what
I
can
gather
by
your
narration
,
"
observed
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
returned
Webber
,
compressing
his
lips
,
"
a
day
of
retribution
is
at
hand
,
and
an
evenger
on
their
trail
—
let
them
<EOS>
beware!"The
party
had
by
this
time
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Right
here
's
the
place
where
I
had
the
satisfaction
of
trying
my
science
on
that
are
scoundrel
,
Curdish
!
"
said
Bernard
,
as
they
rode
past
where
the
attack
had
been
made
on
Edward
and
Emily
.
<EOS>
"Well
chosen
for
their
design
,
"
returned
Webber
;
"
but
I
trust
,
Harvey
,
when
you
display
your
science
again
,
you
will
make
a
better
shot
than
before
.
<EOS>
""I'd
<EOS>
jest
like
to
git
another
chance
to
display
it
like
,
"
rejoined
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"Doubtless
<EOS>
you
will
have
one
ere
long
,
"
said
Webber
;
"
but
come
,
we
waste
time
;
let
us
to
the
spur
.
<EOS>
"Accordingly
<EOS>
at
the
word
they
set
forward
at
a
rapid
gallop
,
through
the
ravine
previously
mentioned
,
nor
did
they
loose
rein
again
until
they
neared
the
old
hut
occupied
by
Hetty
Brogan
,
<EOS>
when
turning
aside
into
some
bushes
they
came
to
a
halt
,
and
Webber
said:"Look
well
<EOS>
to
your
weapons
,
comrades
;
for
somehow
I
have
a
presentiment
we
shall
have
difficulty
ere
we
have
done
here
.
<EOS>
The
door
is
closed
however
,
and
the
hut
has
the
appearance
of
being
deserted
;
nevertheless
we
are
on
an
ugly
mission
,
and
there
is
nothing
lost
by
being
cautious
.
<EOS>
It
is
possible
Hetty
may
not
have
arisen
,
though
the
sun
is
already
over
the
hill
;
and
it
is
possible
too
there
may
be
some
of
the
rascals
within
,
<EOS>
as
they
doubtless
,
at
times
,
make
this
place
a
rendezvous
;
but
I
will
soon
ascertain
;
"
saying
which
he
dismounted
and
threw
his
reins
to
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"Look
<EOS>
a
here
,
Bill
Webber
,
"
returned
the
latter
,
"
<EOS>
afore
you
go
to
work
in
this
ere
business
,
jest
listen
a
minute
.
<EOS>
Ye
see
,
Bill
,
you
're
putty
considerable
<EOS>
kind
o
'
apt
to
have
every
thing
jest
your
own
way
,
but
in
this
ere
perticular
case
I
want
mine
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
Harvey
,
what
is
it
?
"
asked
Webber
.
"Why
<EOS>
to
say
it
right
out
and
out
<EOS>
it
's
jest
<EOS>
this
:
—
<EOS>
You
're
somewhat
older
than
I
am
,
and
per'aps
ai
nt
quite
so
strong
,
<EOS>
though
you
're
a
putty
strong
man
,
that
's
a
fact
;
but
then
you
've
got
a
family
<EOS>
and
I
haint
,
<EOS>
and
what
's
more
,
never
expect
to
have
;
though
I
did
love
a
gal
<EOS>
Down
East
,
as
the
saying
is
,
but
then
she
kind
o
'
took
to
another
feller
,
and
so
I
jest
let
her
go
it
,
and
concluded
to
punish
the
hull
race
by
never
gitting
married
at
all
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
<EOS>
well
,
Harvey
,
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
this
affair
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Webber
,
a
little
impatiently
.
"Why
<EOS>
jest
<EOS>
this
:
that
you
'll
stay
out
here
with
the
horses
,
and
let
me
and
Mark
venter
in
;
'cause
per'aps
there
'll
be
trouble
,
and
like
enough
somebody'll
git
hurt
;
and
if
its
me
,
ye
see
,
why
I
haint
no
family
depending
on
me
,
and
twont
matter
much
.
<EOS>
""Noble
,
generous
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Webber
,
warmly
,
approaching
and
grasping
his
hand
,
while
a
tear
glistened
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
well
,
Bernard
,
and
I
know
that
you
would
give
your
life
for
a
friend
at
any
moment
;
still
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
any
more
claims
on
your
life
because
it
would
be
freely
given
,
nor
that
I
should
stand
back
and
let
you
run
all
the
risks
because
you
are
single
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
<EOS>
I
have
a
family
,
who
would
mourn
my
loss
<EOS>
should
I
meet
with
a
fatal
accident
;
but
then
I
have
no
right
to
sacrifice
a
friend
on
this
account
,
neither
will
I
do
it
.
<EOS>
""O
,
as
to
that
,
"
replied
Bernard
,
<EOS>
"
you
ai
nt
a
going
to
sacrifice
any
body
in
that
way
,
so
you
need
n't
be
afeard
;
but
one
thing
I
'm
jest
a
going
to
tell
you
,
and
that
is
,
if
you
do
n't
want
to
quarrel
with
me
,
you
'll
jest
stay
here
with
these
ere
animals
,
and
let
me
and
Mark
go
ahead
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
Bernard
spoke
,
both
himself
and
Tyrone
dismounted
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
add
my
voice
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
that
you
take
Bernard
's
advice
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
comrades
,
"
answered
Webber
,
"
since
you
are
both
determined
on
this
point
,
why
of
course
I
must
acquiesce
;
but
do
not
be
too
venturesome
,
and
bear
in
mind
<EOS>
I
hold
the
horses
here
,
ready
for
instant
mounting
if
necessary
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
right
,
"
returned
Bernard
,
drawing
his
pistols
and
looking
to
their
priming
,
while
Tyrone
did
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
right
,
I
say
;
and
now
Mark
,
we
'll
jest
go
ahead
;
"
and
at
the
word
both
started
forward
.
<EOS>
The
hut
was
only
some
hundred
yards
distant
,
and
but
little
time
elapsed
ere
Bernard
was
knocking
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
Not
receiving
an
answer
to
this
,
he
pressed
with
considerable
force
against
it
,
when
somewhat
to
his
surprise
it
quietly
swung
back
on
its
hinges
.
<EOS>
"I
guess
the
bird
's
flew
,
"
Tyrone
,
said
he
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
pistol
in
hand
he
entered
,
followed
in
like
manner
by
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
thing
is
certain
,
"
returned
Tyrone
,
as
having
entered
he
glanced
around
the
gloomy
apartment
,
"
and
that
is
that
nobody
is
here
but
ourselves
.
<EOS>
""True
's
preaching
,
Mark
,
"
rejoined
Bernard
;
"
but
I
can
tell
you
one
thing
more
,
they
haint
been
gone
long
,
and
there
's
been
a
number
on
'em
here
too
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
them
ere
cards
scattered
all
about
,
and
that
are
bottle
on
the
table
,
and
these
ere
wet
spots
,
where
they
've
spilt
their
licker
;
and
do
n't
you
smell
old
stinking
tobacker
smoke
too?""Right
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Tyrone
;
"
these
certainly
are
sure
indications
of
a
party
having
been
here
quite
lately
,
and
perhaps
even
now
are
not
far
off
-
<EOS>
Who
knows
—
"
<EOS>
His
speech
was
here
cut
short
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
three
figures
,
whose
faces
were
concealed
by
black
masks
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
by
St.
Christopher
,
we
've
got
you
now
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
foremost
,
whose
left
arm
was
bandaged
,
and
whom
of
course
the
reader
will
at
once
recognise
as
Curdish
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
'
scape
<EOS>
this
ar
'
<EOS>
perticular
time
,
you
—
Yankee
!
"
and
rushing
forward
,
he
fired
a
pistol
directly
at
the
head
of
Bernard
,
who
,
though
taken
by
surprise
,
and
but
a
moment
left
for
thought
,
still
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
cast
his
head
aside
,
just
at
the
instant
of
the
discharge
,
by
which
means
the
ball
slightly
grazed
his
cheek
,
carried
away
a
small
portion
of
his
ear
,
and
lodged
in
the
wall
beyond
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
's
such
a
thing
as
being
mistaken
in
this
ere
world
,
Mr.
Jack
Curdish
,
"
returned
Bernard
,
cooly
,
following
his
example
,
and
sending
a
ball
through
the
fleshy
portion
of
the
wounded
arm
of
his
antagonist
,
near
the
shoulder
,
who
staggered
back
with
a
howl
of
rage
and
pain
,
and
gnashed
his
teeth
together
in
terrible
fury
.
<EOS>
Instantly
recovering
himself
,
and
drawing
a
long
knife
from
his
belt
,
Curdish
again
sprang
forward
,
with
a
horrible
oath
,
and
aimed
a
rapid
blow
at
the
heart
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
here
again
Bernard
's
coolness
and
dexterity
saved
him
;
for
watching
the
movement
with
a
keen
,
sure
eye
,
he
sprang
suddenly
aside
—
the
blow
missed
its
object
—
and
Curdish
,
who
had
thrown
his
whole
force
into
it
,
fell
heavily
against
him
.
<EOS>
Quick
as
thought
Bernard
again
started
back
,
and
ere
the
other
had
time
to
regain
his
balance
,
with
a
tremendous
blow
he
drove
the
breech
of
the
discharged
pistol
full
in
his
face
,
destroying
his
mask
,
and
he
fell
backward
upon
the
ground
--
senseless
--
his
features
besmeared
with
blood
.
<EOS>
This
,
Bernard
was
on
the
point
of
following
up
with
severer
measures
,
when
a
cry
,
and
a
glance
at
Tyrone
,
arresting
him
,
he
sprang
quickly
to
his
relief
—
fortunately
just
in
time
to
save
his
life
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
manner
of
attack
on
Bernard
and
Tyrone
was
preconcerted
,
or
whether
the
ruffians
were
governed
by
circumstances
after
their
entrance
,
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
certain
it
is
,
in
either
case
,
there
was
a
grand
oversight
in
their
proceedings
;
<EOS>
for
had
two
attacked
Beruard
,
instead
of
Tyrone
,
the
result
might
have
been
more
to
their
liking
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
Curdish
,
thirsting
for
revenge
,
and
feeling
sure
of
his
man
,
had
chosen
Bernard
for
himself
—
alone
—
expecting
to
give
him
a
sudden
quietus
,
while
the
other
two
should
as
easily
despatch
his
companion
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
however
,
no
sooner
did
Curdish
rush
towards
Bernard
—
who
was
standing
near
the
centre
of
the
room
,
and
the
farthest
from
the
door
—
than
his
two
followers
,
Saxton
and
Riley
,
turned
upon
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
Saxton
being
the
foremost
of
the
two
,
instantly
snapped
a
pistol
at
the
breast
of
Tyrone
,
which
fortunately
missed
fire
,
when
Tyrone
,
seeing
how
matters
stood
,
and
knowing
his
life
depended
upon
his
greatest
exertions
,
discharged
each
of
his
pistols
in
quick
succession
,
but
with
no
other
effect
than
that
of
slightly
wounding
Riley
in
the
head
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
his
failure
—
owing
to
his
haste
—
and
knowing
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
,
as
his
enemies
were
close
upon
him
,
he
took
one
step
backward
,
and
then
suddenly
bounding
into
the
air
,
planted
both
feet
against
the
breast
of
Saxton
with
such
tremendous
force
that
he
fell
back
upon
Riley
,
who
,
not
being
prepared
for
the
shock
,
was
thrown
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Following
up
this
slight
advantage
,
Tyrone
instantly
drew
his
knife
and
made
a
pass
at
Saxton
's
throat
,
who
caught
his
arm
with
a
mighty
grasp
,
as
the
blow
was
in
progress
,
and
then
closing
in
with
,
endeavored
to
wrench
the
weapon
from
him
,
or
get
an
opportunity
to
draw
his
own
.
<EOS>
Saxton
,
although
a
powerful
man
,
and
far
superior
to
Tyrone
in
size
and
strength
,
was
yet
greatly
his
inferior
in
supleness
and
science
;
and
taking
advantage
of
his
knowledge
of
wrestling
,
Tyrone
had
no
sooner
fairly
closed
in
with
him
,
than
by
a
dexterous
movement
he
coiled
his
legs
around
the
other
's
,
took
a
sudden
lock
,
and
threw
him
upon
his
back
with
tremendous
violence
—
<EOS>
himself
falling
uppermost
.
<EOS>
Ere
he
could
make
use
of
this
advantage
,
Saxton
seized
upon
the
rifle
which
was
still
attached
to
Tyrone
's
shoulder
—
one
hand
on
either
side
—
and
by
this
means
drew
him
down
with
so
close
a
hug
,
that
his
breath
was
completely
suspended
,
and
all
power
of
action
.
<EOS>
Riley
had
by
this
time
regained
his
feet
;
and
on
a
call
from
Saxton
to
release
him
by
killing
Tyrone
,
and
somewhat
enraged
at
his
own
wound
and
fall
,
he
drew
a
pistol
,
cocked
,
presented
it
to
his
head
,
and
his
finger
was
already
pulling
upon
the
trigger
,
when
Bernard
,
who
had
seen
the
movement
in
time
to
reach
him
,
suddenly
hurled
him
backward
,
by
which
means
the
muzzle
was
elevated
sufficiently
,
as
it
went
off
,
to
clear
the
head
of
Tyrone
,
and
bury
the
ball
in
the
earth
a
few
feet
beyond
.
<EOS>
"You
wo
nt
try
that
are
motion
again
soon
,
I
guess
,
"
remarked
Bernard
,
cooly
,
as
he
deliberately
drew
his
other
pistol
,
pointed
it
at
the
head
of
Riley
,
and
glanced
steadily
along
the
barrel
.
<EOS>
"
Take
that
for
your
pains
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
and
with
the
word
came
a
sharp
report
.
<EOS>
Riley
bounded
from
the
earth
,
with
a
shriek
,
and
fell
dead
at
his
feet
—
his
forehead
pierced
by
a
ball
.
<EOS>
His
presentiment
had
proved
too
true
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
came
the
report
of
a
rifle
,
and
a
cry
from
without
.
<EOS>
Bernard
started
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
—
Webber
was
evidently
attacked
—
perhaps
killed
.
<EOS>
No
time
was
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Unslinging
his
rifle
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
,
he
dealt
Saxton
so
powerful
a
blow
with
the
breech
,
that
his
hold
instantly
relaxed
,
leaving
Tyrone
free
.
<EOS>
"Up
,
Mark
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bernard
;
"
I
guess
there
's
more
work
on
hand
out
<EOS>
o
'
doors
;
"
and
without
pausing
longer
he
rushed
forth
,
followed
by
Tyrone
,
both
of
whom
made
all
haste
possible
to
where
Webber
had
been
left
with
the
horses
.
—
<EOS>
Here
,
much
to
their
joy
,
they
found
Webber
,
rifle
in
hand
,
in
company
with
Edward
Merton
,
who
had
just
arrived
and
dismounted
from
his
horse
,
which
he
still
held
by
the
bridle
.
<EOS>
"Thank
<EOS>
God
,
friends
,
you
are
safe
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Webber
,
joyfully
,
as
they
approached
,
extending
a
hand
to
each
,
while
Merton
did
the
same
:
<EOS>
"
I
feared
you
were
killed
,
as
I
heard
the
report
of
several
pistols
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
we
've
had
a
putty
considerable
rough
time
on't
,
"
said
Bernard
in
reply
;
"
but
I
guess
as
how
them
are
chaps
have
had
a
rougher
—
though
one
on
'em
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
knows
much
about
it
now
,
or
ever
will
know
again
either
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
you
killed
one
,
Harvey
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Webber
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"Wal
<EOS>
I
rather
guess
as
how
one
on
'em
'll
be
gitting
cold
afore
long
,
"
he
answered
;
"
at
least
that
's
my
candid
opinion
about
it
;
but
I
thought
there
was
a
fuss
out
here
,
for
I
heerd
a
gun
go
off
,
and
heerd
somebody
holler
like
too
,
or
my
ears
deceived
me
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
yes
,
"
returned
Webber
,
"
there
was
some
trouble
here
a
few
minutes
since
;
but
thanks
to
the
timely
arrival
of
friend
Edward
,
here
,
nothing
serious
has
happened
on
our
part
,
though
whether
the
other
side
escaped
as
scatheless
is
somewhat
doubtful
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
were
attacked
also
?
"
said
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"I
was
,
"
answered
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
Scarcely
had
you
entered
the
hut
,
and
while
I
was
anxiously
looking
in
that
direction
,
anticipating
difficulty
for
you
,
two
men
crept
stealthily
behind
and
instantaneously
seized
me
,
one
hold
of
either
arm
,
which
they
crossed
upon
my
back
.
<EOS>
I
made
a
sudden
spring
forward
,
but
I
am
not
what
I
once
was
I
find
,
and
they
were
both
strong
men
and
held
me
firmly
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
I
saw
three
ruffians
enter
the
hut
,
and
immediately
heard
several
reports
of
firearms
in
quick
succession
,
and
believed
that
all
was
over
with
both
of
you
;
for
taken
as
you
were
by
surprise
,
I
did
not
deem
it
possible
for
you
to
escape
.
<EOS>
I
made
another
attempt
to
free
myself
,
but
in
vain
;
and
thinking
my
own
time
had
now
come
,
I
resigned
myself
to
my
fate
,
expecting
every
moment
to
be
shot
or
stabbed
in
the
back
.
<EOS>
But
much
to
my
surpise
however
,
instead
of
such
severe
measures
,
I
only
felt
my
captors
securing
my
hands
with
a
cord
,
and
hope
revived
that
they
were
not
perhaps
seeking
my
life
.
<EOS>
Why
they
used
no
other
violence
is
yet
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
horseman
dashed
suddenly
into
the
bushes
,
and
with
a
thrill
of
joy
I
recognised
in
the
rider
the
familiar
face
of
friend
Merton
.
<EOS>
At
sight
of
him
a
panic
seemed
to
seize
upon
my
captors
,
who
instantly
let
go
their
hold
and
fled
.
<EOS>
Determined
not
to
let
them
part
without
a
token
of
remembrance
,
I
unslung
my
rifle
,
which
they
had
left
untouched
,
and
with
a
hasty
aim
fired
at
the
nearest
,
just
as
he
was
leaving
my
sight
by
entering
some
thick
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
result
of
the
shot
I
know
not
;
but
he
appeared
to
stumble
forward
,
and
uttered
a
piercing
cry
as
of
pain
—
which
were
,
I
presume
,
the
sounds
you
heard
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
time
to
grasp
Edward
by
the
hand
,
tell
him
of
your
supposed
fates
,
and
the
necessity
,
if
living
,
of
our
coming
speedidy
to
your
assistance
,
when
,
to
my
astonishment
,
and
I
need
not
add
joy
,
I
saw
you
both
issue
forth
,
and
awaited
your
approach
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
we
have
already
talked
too
long
in
a
time
when
decided
action
is
so
necessary
.
<EOS>
Let
us
reload
as
speedily
as
possible
,
and
follow
up
our
so
far
good
fortune
.
""Right
!
"
said
Bernard
and
Tyrone
in
a
breath
;
and
all
four
instantly
commenced
carrying
out
Webber
's
suggestion
.
<EOS>
We
wish
the
reader
to
bear
in
mind
here
,
that
though
we
have
been
somewhat
long
in
describing
the
events
as
they
took
place
—
owing
to
our
relating
each
one
separately
—
the
whole
time
occupied
,
from
the
entrance
of
Curdish
,
Riley
and
Saxton
,
to
the
meeting
of
Webber
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
,
did
not
exceed
three
minutes
.
<EOS>
But
a
short
time
elapsed
ere
our
party
were
again
ready
for
action
;
and
nothing
daunted
by
what
had
taken
place
,
on
a
second
suggestion
from
Webber
,
they
made
the
bridles
of
their
horses
fast
to
some
of
the
shrubbery
,
and
all
four
set
forward
to
the
old
hut
,
to
secure
the
ruffians
—
not
doubting
they
were
still
there
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
they
were
mistaken
;
for
on
arriving
at
the
place
,
not
a
trace
of
either
,
with
the
exception
of
some
red
spots
of
blood
,
could
be
found,—Curdish
and
Saxton
having
recovered
in
their
absence
and
left
,
bearing
the
corpse
of
Riley
with
them
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
remarked
Webber
,
as
he
glanced
around
the
late
scene
of
strife
,
"
they
have
escaped
us
I
perceive
;
and
perhaps
it
is
better
that
it
is
so
,
as
we
still
have
other
very
important
matters
on
our
hands
,
which
they
might
have
prevented
us
from
attending
to
in
season
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
what
do
you
allude
?
"
asked
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
forgotten
the
Jew
and
those
papers
<EOS>
—
that
is
if
he
has
any
in
his
possession?""Ah
!
<EOS>
true
,
"
rejoined
<EOS>
Tyrone:—"But
<EOS>
do
you
think
of
proceeding
upon
that
business
at
once?""I
do
,
"
answered
Webber
,
"
as
soon
as
may
be
;
for
if
he
is
connected
with
these
fellows
,
as
I
doubt
not
he
is
,
he
will
be
likely
to
receive
from
them
information
of
what
has
happened
;
and
perhaps
,
expecting
a
like
visit
from
us
,
will
decamp
—
at
least
for
the
time
being
;
and
by
the
way
too
,
the
more
so
,
as
these
fellows
doubtless
—
though
I
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
where
they
got
it
--
had
knowledge
of
our
present
design
;
for
you
see
they
had
their
plans
all
laid
to
attack
us
,
while
Hetty
herself
,
whom
we
came
to
seek
,
is
absent
.
<EOS>
""It
does
certainly
appear
singular
,
"
observed
Tyrone
,
thoughtfully
,
after
a
short
pause
;
"
but
still
I
do
not
see
how
they
could
have
been
informed
;
for
it
was
only
last
evening
<EOS>
we
talked
the
matter
over
,
and
it
has
been
communicated
to
no
one
since
.
<EOS>
"Webber
<EOS>
suddenly
started
,
as
though
some
disagreeable
thought
had
flashed
through
his
mind
,
and
his
cheeks
grew
pale
and
red
,
and
he
hung
his
head
thoughtfully
for
some
time
,
but
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
a
vague
suspicion
of
his
son
John
—
whose
disposition
he
knew
too
well
—
troubled
him
.
<EOS>
But
whatever
it
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
he
returned
no
answer
Bernard
was
the
next
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"I've
been
a
thinking
it
all
over
,
Mark
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
I
rather
guess
I
can
'
splain
it
away
without
making
any
witchery
on't
.
<EOS>
Ye
see
its
been
tarnal
hot
weather
lately
,
and
all
the
winders
has
been
hysted
'bout
our
house
,
so
that
if
any
feller
was
about
as
chose
to
listen
,
he
could
hear
all
that
was
said
easy
enough
.
<EOS>
Now
this
ere
was
the
case
last
night
,
when
we
's
talking
it
all
over
,
and
like
as
not
one
of
these
ere
same
chaps
come
along
,
and
played
the
spy
,
and
got
hold
of
all
twas
said
;
and
like
as
not
too
he
's
done
it
all
along
afore
,
jest
to
know
like
how
things
was
a
going
on
.
<EOS>
""True
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Tyrone
,
"
I
did
not
think
of
this
before
;
but
now
it
strikes
me
very
forcibly
as
being
correct
.
<EOS>
What
is
your
opinion
on
the
subject
,
Webber?""It
may
be
so
,
"
answered
the
latter
;
"
I
hope
it
is
;
"
and
then
turning
abruptly
to
Merton
,
he
continued:—"By
the
way
,
<EOS>
Edward
,
you
are
the
very
person
I
wished
to
see
,
to
question
concerning
that
stranger
whom
you
met
here
,
and
who
gave
his
name
as
Barton
—
the
particulars
of
which
I
got
from
Emily
.
<EOS>
"
At
the
mention
of
the
name
of
Emily
,
there
was
a
brighter
glow
on
the
cheeks
of
Edward
,
which
Webber
apparently
heeded
not
as
he
continued:—"I
wish
you
to
describe
the
personal
appearance
of
this
Barton
.
<EOS>
"Merton
<EOS>
did
so
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
think
Barton
is
his
real
name
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Webber
,
as
the
other
concluded
his
description
.
<EOS>
"I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it
,
"
answered
Merton
.
<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
he
tell
you
his
occupation?""Not
at
our
first
interview
,
but
he
has
since
done
so
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
then
you
have
seen
him
again?""I
have
.
<EOS>
I
rode
in
company
with
him
awhile
this
morning
—
he
overtaking
me
shortly
after
my
leaving
St.
Louis
,
while
the
day
was
yet
grey
,
and
parting
from
me
some
three
miles
back
,
to
go
and
look
at
some
land
,
which
he
stated
he
had
lately
been
purchasing
.
<EOS>
""He
is
then
a
land
speculator?""Such
<EOS>
he
told
me
was
his
business
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
the
same
then
,
"
said
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
does
he
know
of
the
Jew
,
and
how
did
he
explain
that
matter
of
the
ring?""O
,
simply
as
thus
,
"
answered
Merton
.
"
<EOS>
He
stated
that
some
months
since
he
had
purchased
a
large
tract
of
land
,
at
a
very
low
price
,
from
the
fact
that
the
titles
to
it
were
considered
very
doubtful
,
on
account
of
a
supposed
prior
claim
;
that
afterward
,
examining
the
land
,
he
had
found
it
of
great
value
,
by
reason
of
its
lead
mines
;
that
determining
,
if
possible
,
to
find
whether
there
was
a
prior
claim
—
and
,
if
so
,
to
purchase
it
,
ere
<EOS>
his
discovery
leaked
out
—
he
had
advertised
the
same
in
the
papers
,
and
posted
bills
in
different
sections
of
the
country
—
the
result
of
which
had
been
his
receiving
a
call
from
the
Jew
,
who
held
the
papers
of
prior
right
,
and
who
offered
to
sell
,
but
on
high
terms:—that
on
asking
the
Jew
to
produce
his
documents
,
he
had
done
so
;
but
to
his
utter
astonishment
had
found
that
the
deed
—
though
drawn
up
in
proper
form
—
lacked
the
signatures
of
two
persons
necessary
to
make
it
valid,—said
<EOS>
persons
names
having
once
been
there
,
to
all
appearance
,
but
since
faded
out
,
owing
,
doubtless
,
to
their
having
been
written
with
a
villainous
ink
,
to
render
the
instrument
valueless:—that
at
this
discovery
<EOS>
the
rage
and
disappointment
of
the
Jew
had
been
great
:
and
he
had
declared
in
piteous
tones
that
he
was
a
ruined
man
—
having
exhausted
all
his
funds
in
the
purchase
of
this
now
worthless
paper
:
<EOS>
that
thinking
perhaps
the
Jew
had
been
duped
,
and
taking
pity
on
his
grey
hairs
,
he
had
agreed
to
pay
him
a
fair
price
for
his
papers
,
notwithstanding
,
but
on
condition
that
he
should
grant
him
any
favor
in
his
power
,
at
any
moment
,
upon
his
presenting
a
curious
ring
,
which
he
wore
on
his
finger
,
or
on
its
being
presented
by
any
one
he
might
see
proper
to
deputise:—that
to
this
the
Jew
had
sworn
most
solemnly
,
by
his
religion
,
and
by
everything
he
held
sacred
—
and
that
the
first
trial
of
his
oath
had
been
made
by
myself
,
in
the
release
of
Emily
.
<EOS>
Such
was
his
story
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
a
singular
one
,
"
added
Webber
,
in
reply
;
"
though
perhaps
a
true
one
.
""Wal
<EOS>
now
,
Bill
,
I
jest
do
n't
believe
a
darned
word
on't
,
"
said
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"
If
all
the
stories
'bout
that
are
tarnal
old
Jew
be
true
,
he
ai
nt
the
feller
that
would
mind
anything
'bout
an
oath
.
<EOS>
""Unless
<EOS>
for
his
interest
to
do
so
,
"
rejoined
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
You
overlook
,
Harvey
,
that
it
might
,
for
that
time
,
have
been
more
to
his
interest
to
let
the
girl
go
than
to
detain
her
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
his
intentions
were
,
and
still
are
,
to
recapture
her
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
cunning
knave
.
<EOS>
But
whether
true
or
false
,
it
is
the
best
and
only
explanation
we
have
of
the
matter
at
present
;
and
so
we
will
take
it
for
what
it
is
and
let
it
drop
—
for
time
wears
fast
,
and
we
should
even
now
be
on
the
road
;
"
saying
which
,
he
turned
and
led
the
way
from
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
need
my
services
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Merton
,
as
the
party
retraced
their
steps
to
their
horses
.
"No
!
<EOS>
"
answered
Webber
:
"
I
trust
our
force
is
sufficient
;
and
as
I
presume
you
were
on
your
way
to
see
Emily
,
you
had
better
ride
on
;
and
doubtless
your
presence
will
cheer
her
,
for
she
seems
exceedingly
low
spirited
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Merton
,
with
a
flushed
countenance
;
"
I
will
see
her
then
,
and
quickly
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
this
time
they
had
reached
the
bushes
,
where
the
animals
were
standing
,
and
each
selecting
his
own
,
all
four
were
presently
mounted
.
<EOS>
As
they
rode
out
into
the
path
and
separated
—
Merton
to
go
on
to
Webber
's
,
and
the
other
three
to
the
river
—
Webber
turned
in
his
saddle
,
and
said:"Do
not
mention
this
little
skirmish
,
Edward
,
to
any
of
my
family
,
as
it
would
only
alarm
them
needlessly
;
"
and
spurring
his
horse
as
he
spoke
,
he
started
off
in
full
gallop
,
while
the
others
imitated
his
example
.
<EOS>
A
good
ride
of
two
hours
brought
the
party
of
Webber
to
the
river
,
and
a
few
minutes
more
served
to
discover
the
residence
of
the
Jew
;
for
although
neither
of
them
had
seen
it
before
,
the
exact
location
had
been
clearly
pointed
out
.
<EOS>
Dismounting
at
a
little
distance
,
and
fastening
their
horses
,
they
together
proceeded
to
the
old
hovel
.
<EOS>
As
they
neared
the
entrance
,
they
were
somewhat
surprised
to
see
the
figure
of
a
man
—
a
little
distance
below
them
,
near
the
water
's
edge
—
his
face
turned
from
them
,
apparently
in
a
meditative
mood
.
<EOS>
At
sight
of
him
all
three
made
a
halt
,
and
Bernard
and
Tyrone
laid
their
hands
on
their
pistols
,
thinking
perhaps
it
was
another
of
the
gang
with
whom
they
had
been
contending
.
<EOS>
Webber
thought
differently
,
however
,
and
bidding
them
stand
where
they
were
,
he
started
cautiously
forward
to
ascertain
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
figure
turned
his
head
to
the
right
and
left
—
as
though
examining
the
exact
location
of
the
banks
and
stream
—
by
which
means
Webber
caught
a
side
view
of
his
features
,
and
at
once
recognised
him
as
Barton
.
<EOS>
Turning
to
his
friends
,
heinformed
them
who
he
was
,
and
all
three
proceeded
at
once
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Hearing
footsteps
behind
him
,
Barton
started
,
drew
a
pistol
from
a
wampum
belt
around
his
waist
,
and
suddenly
confronted
them
;
when
,
perceiving
the
familiar
face
of
Webber
,
and
nothing
in
the
looks
of
his
companions
of
a
hostile
nature
,
he
quickly
replaced
the
weapon
,
and
,
stepping
forward
,
frankly
extended
his
hand
,
saying
at
the
same
time
,
in
an
easy
,
cordial
tone:"I
give
you
good
morning
,
friend
Webber
;
and
you
also
,
gentlemen
,
"
politely
bowing
to
the
others
;
"
and
a
beautiful
morning
it
is
,
truly
.
<EOS>
"As
we
have
heretofore
,
on
his
first
introduction
to
the
reader
,
taken
much
pains
in
describing
the
personal
appearance
and
singular
dress
of
Barton
,
we
shall
not
do
so
now
,
but
refer
the
curious
to
that
;
merely
stating
,
by
the
way
,
that
his
look
and
dress
were
now
almost
exactly
as
then
—
save
perhaps
a
more
bland
expression
of
countenance
,
and
a
change
from
his
then
strange
cap
to
one
of
silk
velvet
,
from
which
hung
a
silver
corded
tassel
.
<EOS>
After
the
usual
salutations
were
over
,
Barton
said
:
"
I
trust
you
to
excuse
me
,
gentlemen
,
for
drawing
an
offensive
weapon
;
but
I
knew
not
who
were
approaching
,
and
this
part
of
the
country
is
not
entirely
free
,
as
you
are
aware
,
from
dangerous
individuals
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
may
well
say
as
we
are
aware
,
"
returned
Webber
;
"
for
scarcely
two
hours
since
we
were
contending
for
our
lives
with
a
party
of
villains
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Barton
,
with
a
start
,
his
dark
eye
brightening
;
"
pray
,
and
who
were
they?""I
know
not
,
"
answered
Webber
,
"
unless
the
same
gang
that
kidnapped
my
ward
Emily
,
who
through
your
interference
was
rescued
again
,
for
which
service
hold
me
ever
indebted
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
that
was
but
my
duty
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Barton
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
But
are
you
sure
that
any
of
these
persons
are
the
same
as
were
concerned
in
that
affair
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
with
interest
.
<EOS>
"I
could
not
tell
,
for
their
faces
were
concealed
by
masks
,
"
answered
Webber
;
"
though
I
doubt
not
two
of
them
are
the
same
—
in
fact
,
I
have
never
seen
but
<EOS>
one
myself
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
that
are
one
<EOS>
was
there
,
"
said
Bernard
,
"
for
sartin
;
for
when
I
knocked
him
down
with
the
butt
of
one
o
'
my
shooting
irons
,
his
tarnal
black
thing
come
off
,
so
as
I
could
see
his
face
;
and
,
besides
,
I
knowed
his
voice
.
<EOS>
""His
name
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Barton
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"Jack
Curdish!""Ha
!
"
ejaculated
Barton
,
mentally
,
with
a
start
:
"
<EOS>
So
,
so
,
as
I
feared
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
turning
to
Webber
,
while
his
features
exhibited
great
severity
of
expression
,
he
continued
:
"
<EOS>
But
how
did
the
fight
commence
,
and
how
terminate?"Webber
in
a
few
words
explained
all
—
telling
him
of
their
design
of
taking
Hetty
and
the
Jew
prisones
,
and
how
it
was
supposed
the
party
of
Curdish
got
wind
of
it
,
and
so
laid
in
wait
.
<EOS>
Barton
mused
for
a
few
moments
,
with
a
troubled
expression
,
and
then
said
:
"
<EOS>
And
so
one
was
killed
,
and
three
others
wounded
?
<EOS>
Truly
,
you
fought
well
,
gentlemen
!
<EOS>
And
so
Hetty
was
away
?
<EOS>
Well
,
and
the
Jew
is
also
away
.
""How
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Webber
;
"
the
Jew
gone
too?""So
you
will
find
,
when
you
enter
you
hovel
.
<EOS>
—
I
had
but
just
quitted
it
when
you
came
hither
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
our
plan
has
certainly
been
divulged
,
"
returned
Webber
,
gravely
,
placing
his
hand
to
his
brow
,
while
a
look
of
mental
anguish
swept
over
his
features
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
got
news
of
our
design
upon
him
and
fled
;
and
all
hope
of
obtaining
the
papers
,
<EOS>
should
he
have
any
,
is
lost
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
what
papers
do
you
allude
?
"
asked
Baton
.
<EOS>
Webber
here
informed
him
of
his
suspicion
in
regard
to
the
Jew
's
seizure
of
Emily
,
and
why
he
supposed
the
latter
held
proofs
of
her
parentage
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
then
there
is
a
mystery
about
her
birth
?
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Barton
,
enquiringly
.
<EOS>
"There
is
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Webber
;
and
then
in
a
few
words
he
related
the
most
prominent
events
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Barton
again
reflected
some
time
,
seriously
,
and
then
said
abruptly
:
"
I
must
see
her
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
assist
you
in
this
matter
I
will
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
adieu!""Whither
now
?
"
enquired
Webber
,
as
he
turned
to
depart
;
"
and
why
such
haste?""I
must
immediately
to
St.
Louis
,
"
replied
Barton
,
"
as
I
have
business
of
importance
there
that
will
not
brook
delay
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
you
anon
and
talk
this
matter
over
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
the
way
,
Barton
,
"
said
Webber
,
as
he
again
turned
to
go
,
"
you
are
much
about
the
country
,
in
various
sections
,
and
I
wish
to
enquire
if
you
have
heard
of
late
any
thing
of
that
strange
bandit
leader
,
Ronald
Bonardi
,
who
created
so
much
excitement
here
a
few
years
<EOS>
ago?"At
the
mention
of
Bonardi
,
there
was
a
perceptible
start
in
Barton
,
a
little
palor
in
his
cheek
,
and
a
slight
quiver
of
some
of
the
muscles
around
his
mouth
;
but
all
passed
instantly
—
was
noticed
by
Bernard
only
—
and
when
he
replied
,
all
was
again
calm
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
not
,
"
he
said
,
in
answer
to
Webber
's
question
;
"
<EOS>
but
wherefore
do
you
ask?""Merely
to
satisfy
a
curiosity
,
"
replied
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
relating
some
anecdotes
of
him
last
evening
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
strange
,
singular
being
;
but
I
do
not
think
myself
he
was
so
bad
as
he
has
been
represented
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
you
have
heard
much
of
him
in
your
travels?"For
a
moment
Barton
looked
Webber
steadily
in
the
eye
,
and
then
replied
:
"
I
have
heard
of
him
;
but
I
have
no
time
to
talk
of
him
now
:
<EOS>
I
will
,
as
I
said
before
,
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
A
happy
morning
to
you
all
,
gentlemen
;
"
and
turning
away
,
he
strode
forward
a
few
yards
to
where
his
horse
was
standing
concealed
amid
some
thick
shrubbery
,
when
hastily
mounting
,
he
touched
him
with
his
spurs
,
and
was
quickly
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"Barton
ai
nt
his
name
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Bernard
,
as
he
watched
him
disappear
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
"
said
Webber
,
"
if
the
Jew
has
gone
,
we
will
search
his
house
,
at
all
events
;
"
and
retracing
their
steps
up
the
hill
,
all
three
entered
the
hovel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
place
just
fit
for
such
an
old
villain
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Webber
,
as
he
glanced
around
the
dirty
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
"
continued
he
,
as
he
noticed
the
closet
at
the
farther
end
,
"
what
have
we
here
?
"
and
passing
through
the
door
<EOS>
,
he
examined
every
part
of
it
minutely
;
but
,
save
an
old
pistol
-
lock
lying
on
the
shelf
,
with
a
broken
,
rusty
dagger
beside
it
,
he
found
nothing
;
and
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
leaving
,
when
his
foot
struck
against
a
ring
in
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Stooping
down
,
he
took
hold
of
it
,
and
pulling
gently
,
was
surprised
to
find
it
raised
a
trap
-
door
.
"
<EOS>
Ho
,
comrades
,
"
cried
he
,
"
here
is
a
discovery
!
<EOS>
Ugh
,
what
a
stench
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
as
having
thrown
open
the
door
,
he
attempted
to
peer
into
the
darkness
below
.
<EOS>
"What
means
this
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Tyrone
,
as
he
entered
and
strove
also
to
look
down
.
<EOS>
"Some
of
the
old
Jew
's
villainy
<EOS>
,
I
presume
,
"
replied
Webber
;
"
but
we
must
explore
it
,
at
all
events
,
for
I
see
a
ladder
leading
down
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
"
he
added
,
"
we
have
no
light
,
and
it
were
useless
to
go
down
without
one
.
<EOS>
Ugh
!
<EOS>
it
smells
like
a
charnal
house
.
<EOS>
""There
is
a
sort
of
candle
on
the
table
that
would
serve
us
,
"
returned
Tyrone
,
"
if
we
only
had
the
means
of
lighting
it
.
<EOS>
""O
,
that
is
easily
done
,
"
rejoined
Webber
;
and
stepping
into
the
larger
apartment
,
he
drew
one
of
his
pistols
,
applied
some
fine
paper
to
the
pan
,
and
fired
the
charge
into
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
flash
ignited
the
paper
,
and
lighting
the
candle
,
he
shortly
returned
to
the
mouth
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
stay
without
,
by
the
horses
,
Bernard
,
"
continued
he
,
"
as
we
should
not
leave
our
watch
too
long
in
a
place
so
every
way
villainous
!
<EOS>
Will
you
descend
with
me
,
Tyrone?""I
will
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Webber
carefully
placed
his
feet
upon
the
ladder
,
and
about
half
of
his
body
had
disappeared
,
when
there
issued
from
below
a
deep
,
sepulchral
groan
.
<EOS>
Webber
was
a
brave
man
,
and
so
was
his
companion
;
but
there
was
something
awful
in
that
sound
,
and
both
turned
pale
.
"Heavens
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
former
,
after
listening
a
moment
,
"
what
was
that
,
Tyrone
?
"
<EOS>
Ere
the
other
could
reply
,
that
same
hollow
sound
came
up
again
.
"
<EOS>
God
of
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Webber
,
"
it
is
some
human
being
—
probably
one
stabbed
by
the
Jew
and
thrown
down
here
to
die
!
<EOS>
Follow
me
!
"
and
quickly
descending
the
ladder
,
he
was
immediately
joined
by
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
Holding
the
light
before
them
,
they
slowly
groped
their
way
along
the
passage
to
where
the
prisoner
lay
starving
to
death
in
his
rusty
chains
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
my
God
,
what
a
sight
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Webber
,
turning
pale
,
as
the
light
gleamed
full
upon
the
loathsome
spectacle
before
him
,
while
Tyrone
was
too
deeply
affected
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"Food
—
food
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
prisoner
,
in
an
unearthly
voice
,
unable
to
rise
for
his
weakness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
for
God
-
sake
give
me
food
,
or
kill
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
dying
for
food!""Great
Heaven
,
and
starving
to
death
in
this
land
of
plenty
!
"
<EOS>
said
Webber
,
turning
away
,
and
wiping
a
tear
from
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Be
quiet
,
poor
man
!
"
<EOS>
resumed
he
,
turning
to
the
prisoner
;
"
be
quiet
—
you
shall
have
food
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
"
cried
the
other
wildly
,
partly
rising
and
gazing
upon
Webber
;
"
who
speaks
in
that
kind
<EOS>
tone?""A
friend
,
"
replied
Webber
,
"
come
to
release
you
.
<EOS>
""Friend
!
"
screamed
the
prisoner
;
"
friend
—
release
—
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
—
I
know
you,—ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
overpowered
was
he
with
joy
,
at
the
thought
of
escape
from
his
dungeon
,
that
he
fainted
and
fell
back
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
raise
him
,
"
said
Webber
,
bending
down
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ho
!
chains
here
,
and
no
means
to
cut
them
—
<EOS>
what
is
to
be
done?""One
of
us
had
better
speed
instantly
to
St.
Louis
,
"
replied
Tyrone
,
"
and
get
tools
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
food
,
and
a
blanket
to
wrap
around
him
,
and
a
physician
also
,
"
rejoined
Webber
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
;
and
I
will
go
,
<EOS>
for
I
know
where
every
thing
can
be
found
.
<EOS>
Stay
you
here
,
Tyrone
,
stay
you
here
,
and
cheer
him
when
he
revives
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
back
presently
.
<EOS>
My
God
,
what
a
sight
—
what
misery
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Jew
,
Jew
,
your
cup
of
iniquity
is
full
!
<EOS>
God
forgive
you
,
for
I
can
not
!
"
<EOS>
saying
which
,
he
gave
Tyrone
the
light
,
darted
along
the
passage
,
up
the
ladder
,
and
was
soon
standing
by
Bernard
.
<EOS>
Hurriedly
explaining
what
he
had
seen
,
Webber
mounted
the
fleetest
horse
,
and
,
burying
the
spurs
in
his
flanks
,
away
bounded
the
noble
animal
in
the
direction
of
St.
Louis
,
distant
some
eight
or
ten
miles
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
dwell
longer
here
,
for
other
and
more
important
matters
are
pressing
hard
upon
us
.
<EOS>
Suffice
,
that
in
a
couple
of
hours
Webber
returned
—
his
horse
dripping
water
—
bringing
the
necessary
articles
,
and
a
physician
with
him
:
—
that
the
prisoner
was
somewhat
restored
,
his
chains
cut
,
and
,
wrapped
in
a
blanket
,
was
placed
upon
a
horse
in
front
of
Bernard
;
and
that
about
noon
<EOS>
the
whole
party
—
with
the
exception
of
the
physician
,
who
returned
to
St.
Louis
—
set
out
for
Webber
's
,
where
they
arrived
a
little
after
nightfall
,
only
to
feel
more
deeply
the
thrusts
of
villainy
,
and
pass
a
sleepless
night
of
activity
and
anguish
.

I.LOVE

<EOS>
THE
INVALID
—
THE
CONVERSATION
—
THE
PRESENTIMENT
—
THE
WARNING
—
<EOS>
THE
DEPARTURE.Love
—
mighty
love
—
deep
,
pure
,
inward
,
soul
-
stirring
love
!
<EOS>
Who
in
journeying
through
life
has
not
at
sometime
felt
its
rapturous
pleasures
—
its
mental
torturing
pains?—for
love
has
pleasures
,
and
love
has
pains:—pleasures
the
most
deeply
thrilling
—
pains
of
the
deepest
anguish
.
<EOS>
What
a
powerful
thing
is
love
!
<EOS>
How
it
stirs
up
all
the
secret
springs
of
our
being
—
rouses
into
action
energies
and
passions
that
we
knew
not
were
in
us
—
neutralizing
,
at
the
same
time
,
and
sometimes
almost
completely
destroying
,
others
that
we
deemed
were
all
powerful
.
<EOS>
All
potent
love
!
<EOS>
Monarch
of
the
mental
realm
;
to
which
all
—
high
or
low
,
rich
or
poor,—are
forced
to
bow
!
<EOS>
Confined
to
no
grade
or
clime
,
it
sweeps
through
the
universe
,
and
is
felt
in
the
soft
airs
of
Italy
—
in
the
frozen
regions
of
Lapland
.
<EOS>
It
stalks
through
the
palaces
of
the
mighty
ones
of
earth
—
it
lingers
in
the
hovel
of
the
peasant
and
the
outcast
.
<EOS>
It
softens
the
hearts
of
emperors
and
kings
,
and
bends
them
to
its
will
—
it
elevates
,
tranquilizes
,
and
makes
contentment
often
in
the
souls
of
the
lowly
born
.
<EOS>
It
abounds
in
savage
,
as
in
civilized
life
;
and
the
untutored
outpourings
of
the
artless
Indian
of
the
forest
are
as
sweet
to
the
ear
of
the
savage
maiden
,
as
the
most
refined
and
flowery
phrases
of
the
courtly
lover
to
her
who
is
polished
by
the
arts
of
civilization
.
<EOS>
All
conquering
love
!
<EOS>
Who
can
withstand
it
?
<EOS>
It
warms
into
new
life
the
heart
of
the
stoic
—
it
destroys
the
seeming
eternal
reason
raised
fallacies
of
the
great
philosopher
;
and
as
one
by
one
his
self
-
conquering
theories
melt
away
before
him
,
he
sighs
to
own
that
love
is
his
master
,
and
thus
prove
himself
a
frail
piece
of
mortality
.
<EOS>
All
pervading
love
!
<EOS>
Who
has
not
felt
its
presence?O
,
it
is
sweet
to
love
—
to
gaze
upon
some
gentle
or
noble
being
,
and
feel
all
the
deep
emotions
,
all
the
secret
sympathies
of
our
nature
centered
there
,
as
it
were
a
nucleus
to
our
own
vitality
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
And
then
to
feel
that
that
love
is
returned
;
to
know
,
to
realize
there
is
a
spontaneous
unity
,
a
sympathetic
yearning
of
soul
for
soul
;
that
there
is
in
this
cold
and
selfish
world
at
least
one
heart
in
which
we
may
place
confidence
—
one
being
on
whom
we
can
rely
,
to
stand
by
us
,
let
good
or
ill
betide
—
one
kindred
soul
that
will
ever
smile
when
we
rejoice
,
weep
when
we
do
mourn
--
O
,
this
,
this
is
sweet
—
ay
,
sweet
indeed
!
<EOS>
And
who
hath
not
at
some
time
of
his
or
her
life
felt
this
?
<EOS>
and
who
that
hath
felt
,
hath
not
sighed
a
rejoicing
sigh
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
love?But
love
without
hope
—
love
without
a
reciprocity
of
feeling
—
to
love
one
that
you
know
can
never
be
yours
;
one
that
you
know
loves
another
;
as
Shakspeare
says:"Ay
,
there
's
the
rub
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
love
without
hope
is
terrible
—
terrible
!
<EOS>
To
feel
your
whole
life
and
soul
centred
in
a
being
—
a
being
every
way
worthy
,
but
one
who
is
in
turn
fixed
upon
another
,
and
sees
you
not
,
knows
you
not
,
save
as
a
friend
—
a
friend
in
the
cold
,
worldly
meaning
of
the
term
,
and
perhaps
not
even
that
,
or
,
what
is
worse
,
loves
you
as
a
sister
or
a
brother
,
and
,
dreaming
not
of
a
warmer
feeling
in
your
own
breast
,
makes
you
perchance
a
repository
of
confidence
,
and
paints
in
glowing
colors
your
rival
to
your
face
—
<EOS>
oh
,
how
this
can
wring
the
heart!—how
make
it
heave
,
and
palpitate
,
and
burn
,
and
ache
;
and
the
brain
too
,
grow
hot
,
and
seeth
,
and
wither
,
and
strain
,
and
reel
with
this
one
mighty
,
terrible
truth
—
sapping
at
length
all
the
foundations
of
an
otherwise
noble
intellect
—
destroying
the
system
,
and
ending
in
the
cold
and
silent
grave
!
<EOS>
But
few
,
comparatively
speaking
,
feel
this
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
but
oh
,
to
those
few
,
how
terrible
the
feeling
!
<EOS>
We
may
talk
of
the
rack
,
and
the
dumnable
inventions
of
torture
for
the
physical
man
;
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
are
they
when
compared
with
the
rack
that
rends
the
soul?But
,
says
the
reader
,
on
with
the
story
!
<EOS>
Ay
,
and
on
with
the
story
say
we
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
morning
--
the
same
with
which
we
opened
the
chapter
preceeding
—
and
the
sun
,
as
he
rose
in
a
reddened
halo
,
and
peered
gently
over
the
eastern
hill
,
poured
his
soft
mild
rays
through
the
doorway
and
open
casements
of
Webber
's
cottage
,
traced
out
bright
spots
upon
the
curtains
and
floor
,
and
seemed
striving
to
give
every
thing
around
,
animate
and
inanimate
,
a
look
of
gladness
to
welcome
his
approach
.
<EOS>
All
nature
without
wore
a
cheerful
smile
;
and
every
little
zephyr
that
passed
went
loaded
with
perfume
and
song
;
but
with
these
bright
things
our
task
is
not
;
ah
,
no
!
ours
to
peer
into
the
depths
of
that
strange
thing
,
the
human
heart
,
to
decipher
the
characters
on
its
tablets
,
and
thus
trace
the
cause
of
outward
effects
.
<EOS>
Let
us
now
enter
the
apartment
of
the
invalid
,
some
half
hour
after
the
departure
of
Webber
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
But
two
persons
were
there
—
Emily
and
Rufus
--
<EOS>
Mrs
.
Webber
being
employed
with
the
morning
labor
of
the
house
-
wife
in
the
other
apartment
.
<EOS>
Emily
was
seated
by
a
table
—
a
few
feet
from
the
bed
on
which
reclined
Rufus
—
with
one
soft
pearly
hand
resting
upon
it
,
and
her
now
pale
,
sad
,
but
still
sweet
face
inclined
downwards
,
and
her
deep
blue
eyes
gazing
upon
the
floor
,
with
that
peculiar
expression
which
tells
the
mind
is
absent
.
<EOS>
Sad
though
she
was
,
and
with
that
touching
sadness
which
goes
at
once
to
the
heart
,
yet
one
in
gazing
upon
her
could
scarcely
wish
her
otherwise
,
she
looked
so
exceedingly
lovely
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
plain
,
but
neat
;
while
her
bright
auburn
hair
was
arranged
with
that
negligent
grace
which
gives
even
to
beauty
another
charm
;
and
as
the
rays
of
the
sun
,
occasionally
,
from
the
swaying
of
the
curtains
,
streamed
in
upon
it
,
and
deepened
its
golden
hue
,
one
could
easily
fancy
hers
the
head
of
an
angel
encircled
by
a
golden
halo
.
<EOS>
On
the
bed
,
with
his
head
slightly
raised
and
supported
by
his
hand
—
with
his
pale
,
wan
,
but
still
handsome
features
turned
towards
Emily
,
and
his
full
blue
eyes
fastened
tenderly
but
sadly
upon
her
—
lay
the
gentle
Rufus
,
a
prey
to
a
disease
—
a
disease
of
the
mind
—
that
was
destined
ere
long
to
bear
him
to
that
silent
<EOS>
home,"That
undiscovered
country
.
<EOS>
From
whose
bourne
no
traveler
returns
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
what
was
that
disease
—
that
strange
disease
of
the
mind
—
that
was
wearing
away
one
just
ripening
into
the
bloom
of
manhood
,
with
apparently
everything
before
him
to
make
life
happy
?
<EOS>
What
secret
trouble
in
one
so
young
could
be
draining
the
fountains
of
life
and
making
the
fertile
spot
a
desert
?
<EOS>
It
is
time
the
reader
should
know
,
if
he
or
she
(
as
we
doubt
not
)
have
not
already
divined
.
<EOS>
He
was
dying
of
hopeless
love
!
<EOS>
Ay
,
and
before
him
sat
the
being
in
whom
his
vitality
,
as
it
were
,
was
centered
—
totally
unconscious
of
his
consuming
passion
.
<EOS>
And
well
was
it
for
her
<EOS>
she
knew
it
not
;
for
it
would
have
been
another
pang
—
ay
,
and
a
terrible
one
—
to
a
gentle
heart
already
too
full
of
anguish
!
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
returned
his
passion
,
for
her
own
heart
was
set
upon
another
;
and
to
know
him
daily
wasting
away
—
and
to
know
,
too
,
that
she
was
the
cause
—
would
have
been
a
grief
almost
insupportable
.
<EOS>
This
he
knew
,
from
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
,
and
had
resolved
to
carry
his
secret
with
him
to
the
grave
,
which
he
now
felt
was
not
far
distant
.
<EOS>
Thrown
together
in
childhood
,
from
a
child
up
Rufus
had
loved
Emily
—
deeply
,
purely
loved
her
—
and
his
was
a
soul
to
love
but
one
,
and
that
one
with
an
intensity
of
passion
more
powerful
than
life
itself
.
<EOS>
His
playmate
in
youth
,
he
had
dreamed
bright
dreams
of
coming
years
—
had
painted
beautiful
and
happy
pictures
from
the
fancy
wrought
scenes
of
the
shaded
future
;
dreams
which
had
proved
but
dreams
—
pictures
in
which
there
was
no
reality
.
<EOS>
His
first
pang
had
been
on
their
first
separation
some
years
before
;
but
he
had
been
buoyed
up
and
soothed
by
the
charmer
Hope
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
of
her
daily
,
almost
hourly
,
during
her
absence
—
had
longed
for
,
and
yet
almost
dreaded
the
meeting
with
her
again
.
<EOS>
That
meeting
had
at
last
taken
place
,
and
he
had
seen
her
,
after
a
long
absence
,
blooming
in
all
the
graces
of
a
refined
,
noble
,
intellectual
woman
!
<EOS>
He
had
seen
her
more
polished
and
beautiful
than
even
an
ardent
fancy
had
painted
her
,
and
with
his
own
mind
more
expanded
and
matured
,
he
had
felt
his
passion
more
intense
;
which
,
like
the
pent
up
waters
of
a
spring
,
he
knew
must
find
vent
,
or
,
pressed
back
into
its
source
,
the
heart
,
undermine
,
and
finally
destroy
the
clayey
casement
around
it
.
<EOS>
But
alas
for
him
!
<EOS>
too
soon
he
discovered
another
had
at
least
fixed
her
attention
,
if
not
already
won
her
affections
,
and
a
strong
presentiment
had
told
him
the
result
.
<EOS>
Still
the
presentiment
had
not
proved
a
certainty
,
and
the
sweet
voice
of
the
charmer
Hope
had
occasionally
whispered
,
"
All
may
yet
be
well
.
<EOS>
"Thus
six
months
had
rolled
away
,
with
him
<EOS>
al
most
wearily
;
for
although
near
the
gentle
being
of
his
secret
love
,
yet
he
daily
had
seen
new
evidences
to
prove
him
farther
from
her
heart
than
ever
;
and
doubts
,
and
fears
,
with
occasionally
a
ray
of
hope
,
and
sleepless
nights
,
and
days
of
anguish
,
had
already
done
their
work
on
a
constitution
never
at
any
time
the
strongest
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
we
say
,
six
months
had
rolled
away
,
which
brings
us
to
the
opening
of
our
story
—
the
night
of
the
storm
,
and
of
Emily
's
capture
—
in
which
the
reader
will
remember
his
introduction
and
singular
conduct
.
<EOS>
And
yet
that
conduct
and
result
,
when
we
know
the
motive
power
—
the
state
of
his
constitution
,
and
temperament
—
appears
perfectly
simple
and
natural
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
is
,
we
may
add
,
with
every
thing
in
nature
—
everything
around
us
,
that
to
our
limited
vision
appears
mysterious
for
the
time,—no
sooner
do
we
learn
the
cause
,
than
we
admit
the
effect
could
not
have
been
otherwise
,
without
violating
some
law
of
nature
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
in
question
,
then
,
when
he
had
seen
Emily
ride
forth
with
Edward
,
a
presentiment
had
come
over
him
of
trouble
,
and
sorrow
to
come
;
and
his
steps
had
been
slow
,
his
brow
clouded
,
and
his
heart
heavy
;
and
hence
the
cause
of
his
wild
manner
,
which
had
so
surprised
his
father
,
when
it
became
evident
some
accident
had
occurred
to
prevent
their
return
.
<EOS>
Having
paused
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
,
a
moment
on
the
hill
,
he
had
learned
from
Tyrone
the
whole
state
of
the
case
,
and
again
dashed
on
with
a
wildness
bordering
on
insanity
.
<EOS>
Instinctively
—
for
reason
could
scarcely
be
deemed
paramount
with
him
then
—
he
had
shaped
his
course
directly
for
the
Mississippi
;
but
ere
he
could
reach
it
,
his
quick
ear
had
caught
the
sound
of
her
sweet
voice
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
by
the
light
of
the
moon
<EOS>
,
he
had
descried
both
Edward
and
Emily
approaching
.
<EOS>
Being
completely
in
the
shade
,
they
had
not
observed
him
;
and
instantly
reining
his
horse
to
one
side
,
he
had
waited
in
a
thicket
for
them
to
pass
.
<EOS>
And
then
and
there
,
in
that
lonely
place
,
with
his
mind
torn
on
the
rack
of
terrible
excitement
,
he
had
heard
soft
words
from
her
own
sweet
lips
that
went
like
daggers
to
his
heart
,
and
extinguished
the
last
faint
gleam
of
hope
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
after
that
magical
voice
had
died
away
in
the
distance
,
Rufus
had
sat
his
horse
more
like
a
statue
than
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
And
then
and
there
a
terrible
feeling
had
swept
over
him
;
a
feeling
of
despair
and
death
—
a
consciousness
of
life
,
but
life
with
heated
irons
on
his
brain
,
and
poisoned
arrows
in
his
heart
—
while
reason
,
like
a
candle
consumed
to
the
stick
,
was
flickering
in
the
socket
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
he
had
sat
thus
;
and
then
,
with
reason
and
instinct
combined
,
had
come
a
desire
to
reach
home
.
<EOS>
Mechauically
he
had
urged
his
high
-
spirited
beast
onward
,
and
taking
a
circuitous
route
,
had
come
into
the
road
ahead
of
Edward
and
Emily
,
who
,
in
consequence
,
had
never
seen
him
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
reached
home
,
as
we
have
previously
shown
,
long
in
advance
of
the
others
;
but
the
excitement
only
had
supported
him
;
and
when
the
foaming
steed
paused
at
the
door
,
and
he
had
announced
their
safety
,
his
nerves
relaxed
,
reason
for
the
time
fled
,
and
he
had
been
borne
into
the
house
in
a
high
state
of
fever
,
placed
upon
a
bed
,
from
which
he
was
destined
never
to
rise
.
<EOS>
That
there
were
other
causes
,
besides
these
we
have
mentioned
,
combined
to
produce
his
sickness
,
we
do
not
deny
;
but
that
these
were
the
only
preventatives
to
his
recovery
,
we
assert
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
laid
bare
the
secrets
of
his
heart
,
and
the
causes
of
what
might
otherwise
seem
mysterious
actions
,
let
us
new
turn
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
Rufus
gazed
upon
Emily
Nevance
—
who
still
sat
as
we
have
described
her
—
with
a
look
of
intense
sadness
;
and
then
with
a
deep
drawn
sigh
,
he
said:"Why
<EOS>
do
you
look
so
sad
,
Emily
?
<EOS>
I
fear
something
has
gone
wrong
with
you!"At
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
which
was
low
and
musical
,
Emily
started
,
raised
her
face
—
now
somewhat
flushed
—
and
turning
to
Rufus
,
looked
at
him
earnestly
a
moment
,
and
then
replied:"Sad
,
Rufus
;
do
I
then
look
sad?""Indeed
you
do
,
Emily
;
very
,
very
sad
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
it
yesterday
,
after
your
return
from
a
walk
;
and
I
have
noticed
,
too
,
that
you
have
not
smiled
since
,
as
you
used
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
fear
something
troubles
you
,
Emily!"Emily
's
face
grew
a
shade
paler
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Rufus
,
"
she
answered
;
"
something
does
trouble
me
—
though
I
did
not
intend
to
betray
it
by
my
looks
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
not
tell
me
what
it
is
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
Emily
shook
her
head
sadly
,
and
said
:
"
No
,
I
must
not
reveal
it
to
you
,
Rufus!""True
,
"
he
returned
,
while
a
look
of
anguish
swept
ever
his
pale
,
thin
,
but
still
handsome
features
:
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
remembered
,
ere
I
asked
,
that
I
am
not
your
confident
.
<EOS>
""Nor
is
any
one
my
confident
in
this
matter
,
Rufus
,
"
rejoined
Emily
,
quickly
,
a
little
touched
at
his
remark
,
while
the
color
again
tinged
her
fair
features
:
"
I
would
tell
you
as
soon
as
another
,
Rufus!""Forgive
me
,
Emily
,
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
returned
he
,
sinking
back
upon
the
pillow
,
and
placing
his
hand
to
his
head
as
though
in
pain
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
too
hasty
,
and
wronged
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
would
tell
me
if
it
was
proper
for
me
to
know
.
<EOS>
"Emily
was
affected
;
and
approaching
the
bed
,
she
took
one
of
his
thin
hands
in
hers
,
while
a
tear
glistened
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
so
sensitive
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
;
"
but
do
not
be
troubled
so
,
dear
Rufus
,
or
<EOS>
I
shall
grow
more
sad
myself
.
<EOS>
You
ask
me
to
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
gladly
do
so
,
had
I
any
thing
to
forgive
;
but
the
fault
was
all
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
spoken
so
hastily
,
knowing
your
almost
too
sensitive
nature
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
a
moment
Rufus
made
no
reply
,
while
Emily
stood
by
him
,
one
of
his
hands
pressed
in
hers
,
and
the
other
upon
his
eyes
;
and
then
,
with
a
great
effort
at
composure
,
in
a
voice
slightly
trembling
,
he
enquired:"Have
you
seen
Edward
,
of
late?""But
once
since
that
terrible
night
,
"
answered
Emily
,
casting
down
her
eyes
,
while
an
involuntary
sigh
escape
I
her
,
which
Rufus
noted
.
<EOS>
"
He
came
once
,
about
a
week
since
,
while
you
were
lying
in
that
dangerous
state
,
but
made
only
a
short
stay
,
as
we
were
all
too
much
engaged
to
talk
with
him
.
<EOS>
""Doubtless
<EOS>
ere
long
he
will
be
here
again
?
"
<EOS>
said
Rufus
,
enquiringly
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
mentioned
to
-
day
,
when
he
departed
,
"
returned
Emily
,
with
her
eyes
still
bent
downward
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
are
agitated
,
Rufus
,
"
continued
she
,
suddenly
looking
up
,
as
she
felt
his
hand
tremble
in
hers
:
<EOS>
"
What
troubles
you
thus
,
Rufus?""It
is
passed
,
"
he
answered
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
somewhat
subject
to
nervous
agitations
,
and
this
was
one
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
is
the
cause
of
these
?
"
asked
Emily
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
noticed
such
before
at
different
periods
during
your
illness
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
Emily
,
"
returned
he
sadly
,
"
I
can
not
answer
you
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
something
lies
heavy
on
your
mind
,
"
rejoined
Emily
,
soothingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
I
had
the
power
to
alleviate
,
and
restore
you
to
health
and
cheerfulness!"Rufus
withdrew
his
hand
from
his
eyes
as
Emily
spoke
,
and
gazed
upon
her
long
and
earnestly
,
with
an
expression
which
one
of
Emily
's
perception
,
but
less
occupied
than
she
with
painful
thoughts
,
would
never
have
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
think
of
me
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
it
I
divine
rightly
,
trouble
enough
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
As
to
health
and
cheerfulness
,
I
shall
see
them
no
more
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
do
not
—
do
not
talk
thus
!
<EOS>
"
returned
Emily
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Banish
,
Rufus
,
banish
all
such
gloomy
thoughts
!
<EOS>
You
are
young
,
and
I
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
have
before
you
a
long
life
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
"Rufus
<EOS>
shook
his
head
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
do
not
see
,
"
he
answered
,
"
because
you
can
not
see
,
Emily
;
but
he
not
deceived
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
presentiment
that
speaks
to
me
in
a
voice
you
can
not
hear
,
by
which
I
feel
certain
I
shall
never
recover
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
why
should
you
think
thus
,
Rufus
?
—
<EOS>
Your
physician
has
pronounced
you
out
of
danger
,
and
says
that
in
a
few
days
you
will
be
entirely
well
again
.
<EOS>
""Ah
,
Emily
,
I
repeat
,
be
not
deceived
.
<EOS>
My
physician
,
doubtless
,
is
a
very
good
and
skilful
one
,
but
in
this
he
is
mistaken
,
as
time
will
shortly
prove
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
feel
that
I
am
upon
a
bed
of
death
.
<EOS>
But
a
little
while
and
I
shall
pass
from
among
the
living
—
missed
and
mourned
by
a
few
only
—
and
quickly
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
""Oh
<EOS>
no
,
no
—
not
forgotten
,
Rufus
,
"
exclaimed
Emily
,
vehemently
;
"
not
forgotten
,
while
Emily
Nevance
lives
!
<EOS>
But
come
,
come
,
"
added
she
,
"
do
not
talk
of
such
things
;
they
make
me
more
and
more
sad!""Well
,
well
,
"
rejoined
Rufus
,
gently
,
"
we
will
talk
of
them
no
more
then
,
Emily
;
for
Heaven
knows
you
are
sad
enough
with
matters
of
your
own
,
without
being
burdened
with
an
additional
weight
from
me
!
<EOS>
We
will
strive
to
be
more
cheerful
,
Emily
;
we
will
talk
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
You
shall
tell
me
of
your
life
in
the
city
,
and
how
you
first
became
acquainted
with
the
noble
Edward
Merton
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
the
mention
of
the
name
of
Edward
<EOS>
,
Rufus
perceived
a
gentle
glow
suffuse
the
cheeks
of
Emily
;
and
a
brightening
of
the
eye
,
with
a
look
of
pleasure
,
told
plainly
that
the
task
he
had
assigned
her
was
by
no
means
a
hard
one
.
<EOS>
And
such
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Oppressed
by
a
weight
of
gloomy
thoughts
of
impending
evil
,
since
her
interview
with
John
the
day
previous
,
Emily
felt
glad
of
anything
that
would
for
the
time
relieve
her
;
and
seating
herself
by
the
side
of
Rufus
,
she
immediately
complied
with
his
request
;
and
began
by
telling
him
her
first
sensations
when
she
arrived
in
the
great
metropolis
—
spoke
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
citizens
—
of
the
different
grades
of
society
—
and
,
finally
,
touched
upon
Edward
—
their
first
interview
—
gradually
launching
out
upon
his
noble
appearance
,
manly
qualities
,
and
generous
nature
.
<EOS>
As
she
did
so
,
her
very
soul
appeared
to
run
in
her
voice
,
her
eyes
sparkled
,
her
features
became
animated
,
and
she
seemed
for
the
time
completely
carried
away
by
a
noble
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
little
did
she
know
that
every
word
she
uttered
went
like
pointed
steel
to
the
heart
of
Rufus
!
<EOS>
Little
<EOS>
did
she
dream
that
her
narration
was
placing
him
upon
a
rack
of
mental
torture
!
<EOS>
But
Rufus
knew
before
the
state
of
her
feelings
;
and
he
had
asked
her
to
speak
of
the
past
,
and
of
Edward
,
merely
to
relieve
her
of
the
gloomy
thoughts
which
he
knew
must
be
occupying
her
mind
,
to
cause
her
so
much
sadness
.
<EOS>
This
he
did
,
regardless
of
the
pain
it
occasioned
himself
,
which
he
bore
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
or
saddened
gladness
—
if
the
reader
will
allow
us
an
expression
so
paradoxical
.
<EOS>
Thus
passed
two
hours
,
when
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
Edward
himself
.
<EOS>
Emily
started
up
with
an
expression
of
joy
,
and
sprang
to
the
door
to
meet
him
,
while
Rufus
turned
his
head
away
,
for
a
few
moments
,
ere
his
entrance
,
with
a
look
of
deep
anguish
.
<EOS>
When
Edward
did
enter
,
however
,
all
was
calm
again
,
and
Rufus
turned
to
him
with
a
smile
,
and
friendly
greeting
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
forced
for
appearance
sake
as
one
might
suppose
;
for
in
his
heart
Rufus
cherished
for
his
rival
the
most
friendly
feelings
—
believing
him
to
be
a
warm
hearted
,
noble
fellow
—
and
the
cause
of
his
anguish
,
when
Emily
spoke
of
Edward
,
might
be
attributed
to
grief
at
his
own
hopeless
fate
,
rather
than
to
envy
or
jealousy
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
After
passing
the
usual
salutations
of
the
day
,
and
some
little
conversation
on
other
matters
had
occurred
,
Merton
proceeded
to
look
to
the
condition
of
his
horse
;
which
done
,
he
returned
to
the
house
,
and
passed
the
morning
in
a
social
way
,
in
company
with
Emily
and
Rufus
,
occasionally
joined
for
a
few
minutes
by
Mrs.
Webber
herself
.
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
as
the
day
was
so
fine
,
Edward
proposed
to
Emily
to
take
a
short
ride
through
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
somewhat
depressed
in
spirits
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
think
a
little
healthy
exercise
in
the
open
air
will
prove
highly
beneficial
to
you
.
<EOS>
"Emily
<EOS>
hesitated
some
moments
,
ere
making
a
reply
,
while
a
heavy
foreboding
of
coming
ill
depressed
her
even
more
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
somehow
do
not
think
it
advisable
to
go
forth
to
-
day
;
and
besides
,
did
I
wish
to
,
my
Fanny
is
absent
,
on
an
expedition
of
a
different
nature
,
<EOS>
so
you
percieve
I
have
no
animal
to
ride
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
you
shall
take
mine
then
,
"
returned
Edward
,
"
while
I
will
content
myself
to
walk
.
<EOS>
—
But
go
you
must
,
most
certainly
,
Emily
;
for
I
know
it
will
be
for
your
good
—
otherwise
I
would
not
urge
you
.
"After
<EOS>
some
farther
gentle
persuasion
,
Emily
consented
,
on
condition
they
should
not
go
far
,
and
return
ere
nightfall
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
distance
and
time
shall
be
mine
,
"
answered
Merton
;
and
proceeding
at
once
to
the
stable
,
he
shifted
the
saddle
,
and
directly
led
forth
his
noble
beast
,
which
seemed
to
walk
as
though
already
conscious
of
the
lovely
burden
he
was
about
to
bear
.
<EOS>
Emily
in
the
meantime
had
put
on
her
riding
dress
,
velvet
cap
,
and
stood
in
the
door
awaiting
his
return
—
with
her
green
veil
thrown
back
from
her
fair
features
,
which
now
looked
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
<EOS>
As
Merton
led
forth
the
graceful
animal
,
Emily
marked
with
an
experienced
eye
his
stately
step
,
his
full
breast
,
his
handsomely
curved
neck
,
and
,
as
she
did
so
,
a
smile
of
pride
lingered
around
the
corners
of
her
mouth
,
giving
an
animation
to
her
whole
face
—
pride
for
the
animal
of
which
she
was
soon
to
become
,
as
'
twere
,
a
part
.
<EOS>
While
standing
thus
,
and
when
Edward
had
approached
within
a
few
paces
,
she
heard
the
voice
of
Rufus
,
and
turned
back
to
know
what
was
required
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
hither
,
Emily
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
as
she
entered
the
room
,
partly
raising
himself
in
bed
<EOS>
;
"
come
hither
;
I
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
As
Emily
approached
,
she
perceived
he
was
a
good
deal
agitated
,
and
once
or
twice
he
pressed
his
hand
to
his
temples
as
though
in
pain
.
<EOS>
"You
seem
troubled
,
Rufus
,
"
remarked
she
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
more
ill
than
usual?""I
am
far
from
being
well
,
"
he
replied
,
taking
her
hand
,
and
gazing
upon
her
with
a
sad
,
carnest
expression
,
which
she
could
not
account
for
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
far
from
being
well
,
Emily
;
but
I
did
not
call
you
back
to
tell
you
of
my
ailings
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
then
,
Rufus
?
<EOS>
"
asked
she
mildly
,
with
a
tender
look
,
as
he
paused
;
"
what
then?""Perhaps
you
will
laugh
at
me
,
Emily
,
for
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
"
replied
he
solemnly
;
"
yet
I
beg
of
you
to
heed
it
<EOS>
well!""I
shall
not
laugh
,
Rufus
,
say
on
!
"
rejoined
Emily
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
see
by
your
dress
,
"
he
continued
;
"
you
are
going
forth
for
a
ride
.
<EOS>
Do
not
ride
far
,
and
make
sure
of
your
return
ere
the
shadows
stretch
their
full
length
toward
the
east!""Such
<EOS>
was
my
intention
,
Rufus
,
"
returned
Emily
,
surprised
at
his
carnest
look
and
tone
;
"
but
why
this
caution
from
you?""I
know
not
why
,
Emily
,
"
answered
he
sadly
,
"
but
something
tells
me
if
we
do
not
meet
again
ere
the
sun
has
sunk
to
rest
,
we
meet
no
more
in
time
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
this
is
strange
imagining
,
Rufus
—
very
strange
!
"
<EOS>
said
Emily
,
quickly
and
solemnly
,
her
own
foreboding
recurring
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
What
reason
have
you
for
thinking
thus
,
Rufus?""I
can
give
no
reason
,
Emily
,
save
that
God
,
who
orders
all
things
for
the
best
,
sees
proper
at
times
,
to
warn
us
of
approaching
danger
and
dissolution
,
by
what
is
called
a
presentiment
;
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
is
but
the
spirit
acting
for
a
short
period
without
the
physical
taking
cognizance
thereof
—
and
thus
pierces
and
shows
us
what
is
directly
impending
behind
the
veil
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
""I
too
have
had
some
strange
forebodings
of
late
,
"
said
Emily
,
thoughtfully
;
"
though
I
scarcely
know
to
what
they
tend
.
<EOS>
""Ah
,
that
accounts
for
your
sadness
,
then
!
"
rejoined
Rufus
;
"
but
if
you
feel
any
hesitation
now
,
Emily
,
I
beg
of
you
not
to
go
—
for
I
can
not
shake
off
the
idea
,
that
if
you
do
,
we
part
for
the
last
time!""Oh
,
do
not
think
and
say
thus
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Emily
,
with
emotion
,
who
in
spite
of
herself
felt
a
feeling
of
awe
creeping
over
her
.
"
<EOS>
Do
not
say
thus
,
Rufus
!
<EOS>
You
have
long
years
before
you
yet
.
<EOS>
"Rufus
shook
his
head
with
a
wan
smile
.
—
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
,
"
he
said
,
"
what
I
know
,
or
you
would
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
what
I
have
told
you
before
,
that
from
this
bed
I
shall
never
rise!""Are
you
nearly
ready
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
the
voice
of
Merton
from
without
.
<EOS>
"I
must
go
,
dear
Rufus
,
for
I
have
promised
him
I
would
;
otherwise
I
would
not
;
"
said
Emily
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
go
far
,
Rufus
,
and
will
return
ere
sunset
;
this
I
promise
you
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
"
returned
Rufus
,
sadly
,
his
eyes
filling
with
tears
,
"
God
enable
you
to
keep
your
promise
,
Emily
!
<EOS>
but
for
fear
of
the
worst
I
bid
you
farewell
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
pressed
her
hand
respectfully
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
do
not
meet
again
on
earth
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
trembling
voice
,
"
I
trust
we
shall
in
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Farewell
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
unnerve
me
,
Rufus
,
"
said
Emily
,
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
are
making
a
too
solemn
affair
of
this
—
or
are
you
in
reality
dying
,
Rufus
?
"
and
the
very
thought
seemed
to
startle
her
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
feel
myself
to
be
dying
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
term
,
"
answered
Rufus
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
live
weeks
,
even
months
to
come
;
and
I
may
scarcely
live
days
—
<EOS>
so
uncertain
do
I
look
upon
the
time
allotted
me
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
then
,
Rufus
,
"
returned
Emily
,
hastily
drying
her
tears
,
"
do
not
give
way
to
such
gloomy
thoughts
.
<EOS>
I
will
return
again
presently
;
but
I
see
Edward
is
getting
impatient
,
and
I
must
not
keep
him
longer
waiting
.
<EOS>
There
,
good
bye
!
"
and
bending
down
as
she
spoke
<EOS>
,
she
pressed
a
kiss
upon
his
forehead
,
and
turned
quickly
away
.
"Farewell
!
<EOS>
"
uttered
he
again
,
in
a
low
,
trembling
voice
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
should
never
meet
again
,
Emily
,
remember
I
—
I
can
not
tell
you
,
"
he
said
,
as
she
paused
near
the
door—"so
farewell
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
sunk
back
upon
his
pillow
,
and
turned
his
head
away
;
while
Emily
,
her
heart
beating
with
strange
emotions
,
quickly
joined
Edward
.
<EOS>
As
Emily
approached
,
Edward
could
not
but
perceive
that
she
had
been
weeping
;
but
wisely
choosing
to
make
no
comment
thereon
,
he
assisted
her
to
mount
,
and
merely
saying
,
"
To
the
north
,
Emily
,
"
he
led
her
horse
forward
in
that
direction
a
short
distance
,
and
then
yielding
the
guidance
wholly
to
her
,
walked
along
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
Their
departure
had
been
marked
with
an
eager
look
,
by
a
tall
figure
,
standing
a
little
distance
in
the
rear
of
the
cottage
—
on
whose
features
,
as
they
passed
from
his
sight
,
played
a
strange
,
dark
smile
;
and
muttering
,
"
Now
is
my
time
!
"
<EOS>
he
turned
quickly
round
,
and
abruptly
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Who
was
that
figure
?
<EOS>
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
those
singular
words?CHAPTER
II.THE
MEDITATION
—
THE
INTERRUPTION
—
THE
CONVERSATION
—
THE
ARBOR
OF
LOVE
—
THE
DECLARATION
—
THE
STORM
—
THE
MYSTERIOUS
DISAPPEARANCE
—
<EOS>
THE
SEARCH.For
some
time
Edward
and
Emily
pursued
their
way
slowly
and
in
silence
,
for
in
the
hearts
of
both
were
deep
and
powerful
feelings
.
<EOS>
With
Emily
herself
,
circumstances
had
combined
to
depress
her
spirits
with
a
gloominess
seldom
or
never
felt
before
;
for
each
thing
that
had
transpired
of
late
,
seemed
to
rush
in
upon
her
now
,
as
if
to
overwhelm
and
crush
her
beneath
the
gathering
weight
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
thoughts
,
black
and
portentous
as
the
clouds
that
herald
a
terrible
storm
,
came
flitting
like
evil
spirits
through
her
mind
—
<EOS>
each
bearing
its
own
dark
and
cheerless
aspect
—
enlivened
by
no
ray
of
hope
,
no
sunshine
of
gladness
.
<EOS>
Even
the
temporary
relief
she
had
found
while
talking
with
Rufus
of
the
past
and
of
Edward
,
had
,
from
her
after
thoughts
,
and
the
contrast
,
served
to
produce
only
a
painful
reaction
;
and
although
the
one
she
loved
—
the
one
she
had
extolled
in
such
glowing
language
—
was
now
by
her
side
,
yet
that
very
fact
itself
,
instead
of
making
her
joyful
,
only
added
to
her
grief
.
<EOS>
And
wherefore
this?We
have
,
on
a
previous
occasion
,
attempted
to
give
the
reader
an
insight
into
the
character
of
Emily
,
which
,
if
fully
borne
in
mind
,
will
be
sufficient
to
show
why
she
was
thus
actuated
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
we
described
her
as
very
sensitive
,
and
self
-
sacrificing
,
and
one
incapable
of
wounding
the
feelings
of
another
,
when
it
was
possible
for
her
to
avoid
doing
so
without
in
the
end
making
matters
still
worse
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
,
too
,
we
described
her
feelings
in
regard
to
herself
,
and
her
doubtful
parentage
,
as
being
very
painful
;
and
also
her
attachment
for
Edward
—
which
,
on
this
account
,
she
deemed
herself
compelled
by
a
sense
of
duty
to
break
off
—
as
being
no
less
so
.
<EOS>
These
were
enough
to
have
made
her
sad
,
if
not
gloomy
,
even
now
;
for
she
knew
the
result
of
her
decision
must
be
very
painful
both
to
Edward
and
herself
;
but
the
events
which
had
since
transpired
,
had
added
their
sombre
coloring
to
the
already
dark
picture
,
until
not
one
bright
spot
remained
.
<EOS>
The
strange
and
awful
appearance
of
John
—
as
he
stood
like
a
demon
before
her
,
overpowered
by
rage
—
was
still
present
to
her
vision
;
and
his
dark
and
terrible
words
of
threatening
were
still
ringing
in
her
ears
.
<EOS>
What
might
be
the
result
of
that
interview
—
to
what
act
of
villainy
on
his
part
it
might
tend
—
was
impossible
for
her
to
foresee
;
but
,
as
we
have
shown
,
a
heavy
foreboding
of
coming
ill
had
settled
on
her
spirit
—
a
foreboding
she
had
found
impossible
to
shake
off
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
a
stranger
who
thus
accosted
her
—
or
any
one
not
directly
in
the
family
with
whom
she
had
been
reared
,
and
to
whom
,
for
a
thousand
little
acts
of
kindness
,
she
felt
herself
so
much
indebted
<EOS>
—
she
would
have
related
at
once
the
whole
occurrence
,
that
proper
precautions
might
be
taken
to
secure
her
against
violence
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
case
stood
,
in
the
present
instance
,
she
did
not
feel
herself
at
liberty
to
do
so
—
from
the
fact
that
,
knowing
the
strong
temperaments
of
both
father
and
son
,
she
foresaw
consequences
of
a
disagreeable
nature
must
naturally
ensue
,
and
that
she
,
however
indirectly
,
would
be
the
moving
cause
of
a
rupture
,
and
perhaps
a
disunion
in
the
family
;
and
besides
,
too
,
she
vaguely
trusted
the
whole
affair
would
terminate
in
simply
a
threat
;
that
John
might
have
uttered
it
,
while
in
passion
,
merely
to
intimidate
her
;
and
that
when
he
should
come
to
himself
,
he
would
see
his
folly
and
let
it
pass
.
<EOS>
This
we
say
she
hoped
;
but
in
truth
she
doubted
,
and
feared
,
and
it
troubled
her
much
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
She
longed
to
make
some
one
her
confidant
,
and
take
advice
regarding
the
proper
course
for
her
to
pursue
;
but
she
knew
of
none
in
whose
keeping
the
secret
would
be
safe
—
no
,
not
even
with
Edward
himself
;
for
in
his
earnest
regard
for
her
welfare
,
she
knew
he
would
feel
himself
justified
in
at
once
laying
the
matter
before
Webber
,
and
even
confronting
John
himself
,
when
probably
a
quarrel
,
and
a
duel
,
perhaps
,
would
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
No
,
she
must
keep
it
locked
in
her
own
breast
,
and
bear
her
painful
thoughts
in
silence
.
<EOS>
All
these
things
,
together
with
the
grief
she
felt
for
Rufus
,
and
the
recollection
of
their
solemn
parting
,
and
his
seeming
prophetic
words
,
were
sufficient
,
as
we
have
said
,
to
cloud
Emily
's
naturally
bright
spirit
with
a
gloom
she
had
never
known
before
;
and
pondering
these
all
over
in
her
mind
,
as
she
rode
along
,
she
allowed
her
head
to
droop
,
and
gazed
upon
the
ground
with
an
abstracted
air
.
<EOS>
Edward
,
as
he
walked
along
by
her
side
,
was
also
busy
with
thoughts
of
his
own
;
and
his
eyes
,
too
,
were
bent
on
the
ground
,
while
the
expression
of
his
features
,
if
not
sad
,
was
at
least
solemn
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
there
to
cause
this
?
<EOS>
We
answer
,
many
things
.
<EOS>
As
the
reader
is
aware
,
Edward
's
first
interview
with
Emily
had
been
while
a
student
in
the
city
of
New
York
;
and
from
that
moment
he
had
felt
that
his
future
happiness
or
misery
rested
with
her
;
and
,
in
consequence
,
he
had
studiously
sought
to
win
her
affections
.
<EOS>
In
this
,
as
the
reader
is
also
aware
,
he
had
succeeded
;
and
twice
he
had
offered
her
his
hand
;
but
although
not
exactly
refused
,
he
had
been
put
off
with
the
plea
that
both
were
yet
too
young
,
and
that
she
could
not
think
of
wedding
him
until
he
had
asked
and
obtained
the
consent
of
his
parents
.
<EOS>
This
with
him
had
been
a
severe
drawback
;
for
although
he
felt
he
might
succeed
in
gaining
the
consent
of
his
mother
,
yet
he
knew
his
father
—
who
was
a
wealthy
merchant
in
St.
Louis
,
and
whose
soul
was
centered
on
gold
—
had
,
for
years
,
in
his
own
mind
,
destined
him
to
marry
,
so
soon
as
both
parties
were
of
the
proper
age
,
a
distant
relation
—
an
heiress
of
great
wealth
.
<EOS>
That
in
this
alliance
,
money
was
all
his
father
sought
or
cared
for
,
he
believed
;
and
the
very
thought
that
he
should
thus
give
his
hand
for
gold
,
was
,
to
one
of
his
proud
,
noble
spirit
,
repugnant
in
the
extreme
;
and
he
had
fully
determined
in
his
own
mind
such
an
event
should
never
take
place
;
and
to
such
an
extreme
will
prejudice
of
this
kind
sometimes
carry
a
person
of
his
temperament
,
that
it
is
a
questionable
point
whether
,
had
Emily
herself
been
the
heiress
,
and
he
known
it
previously
,
he
had
not
on
this
account
refused
even
her
.
<EOS>
Convinced
,
at
length
,
that
though
Emily
ardently
loved
him
,
she
on
this
one
point
would
remain
firm
in
her
first
decision
,
he
had
resolved
—
after
his
interview
with
her
on
the
night
of
the
opening
of
our
story
—
to
lay
the
whole
affair
before
his
father
,
tell
him
exactly
how
matters
were
in
every
particular
,
the
hopelessness
of
his
expecting
him
to
form
another
attachment
,
and
thus
endeavor
to
win
his
consent
.
<EOS>
This
he
had
done
,
or
rather
had
attempted
to
do
;
for
scarcely
had
he
broached
the
subject
,
so
that
his
father
understood
the
drift
of
it
,
ere
the
latter
,
in
a
terrible
passion
,
bade
him
begone
,
and
never
speak
to
him
of
the
like
again
—
telling
him
he
should
never
marry
one
poorer
than
himself
with
his
consent
,
and
that
should
he
dare
to
marry
without
his
consent
,
he
would
both
disown
and
disinherit
him
.
<EOS>
Although
Edward
had
been
in
part
prepared
for
this
,
from
knowing
his
father
's
worldly
motives
and
hasty
temper
,
yet
the
result
had
been
to
cause
him
great
pain
and
despondency
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
might
despond
,
Edward
was
not
one
to
despair
,
while
there
was
even
the
faintest
gleam
of
hope
remaining
;
and
he
had
determined
,
as
a
last
resource
,
to
see
Emily
,
tell
her
all
,
offer
her
his
hand
once
more
,
and
abide
her
decision
.
<EOS>
—
With
this
intent
he
had
called
upon
her
once
since
that
night
;
but
owing
to
the
severe
illness
of
Rufus
,
no
opportunity
had
presented
itself
for
conversation
on
the
subject
,
and
he
had
resolved
upon
to
-
day
for
his
next
meeting
—
which
meeting
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
has
already
taken
place
.
<EOS>
Not
being
sufficiently
in
private
in
the
cottage
for
his
purpose
Edward
,
on
this
account
,
partly
,
and
partly
on
account
of
her
gloomy
appearance
,
had
been
strenuous
in
urging
Emily
to
ride
forth
.
<EOS>
Occupied
in
thinking
on
this
subject
,
and
how
best
to
introduce
it
,
for
a
goodly
distance
kept
Edward
silent
,
while
Emily
,
as
we
have
shown
,
was
,
from
various
causes
,
silent
also
.
<EOS>
The
longest
soliloquy
or
meditation
must
come
to
an
end
;
and
both
Edward
and
Emily
found
themselves
suddenly
aroused
from
their
reveries
by
a
rather
ludicrous
circumstance
.
<EOS>
So
intently
had
their
minds
been
fixed
upon
the
matters
just
recorded
,
that
no
attention
whatever
had
been
paid
by
either
to
the
course
of
the
beast
;
which
having
been
left
entirely
free
,
thought
,
doubtless
,
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
choose
for
himself
,
and
accordingly
had
quitted
the
path
they
supposed
themselves
pursuing
,
and
was
,
at
this
moment
,
quietly
endeavoring
to
force
his
way
through
some
dense
shrubbery
—
the
limbs
of
which
coming
in
rather
severe
contact
with
his
more
reasoning
companions
,
and
some
what
startled
them
.
<EOS>
What
a
strange
,
vacillating
creature
is
a
human
being
!
<EOS>
How
changeable
,
and
what
an
embodied
medley
of
inconsistencies
!
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
Edward
and
Emily
look
up
at
this
interruption
,
see
the
predicament
in
which
they
were
placed
,
and
fully
comprehend
the
ridiculous
appearance
of
their
situation
,
than
,
in
spite
of
their
gloomy
thoughts
,
their
dark
forebodings
,
both
were
forced
into
a
gay
laugh
.
<EOS>
"Truly
,
Emily
,
"
said
Edward
,
with
a
smile
,
as
they
turned
back
to
retrace
their
steps
,
"
this
little
incident
should
prove
warning
sufficient
that
we
have
both
been
too
gloomy
for
a
day
so
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Look
—
how
bright
shines
the
sun
!
<EOS>
Listen
—
how
sweet
and
merrily
sing
the
birds!""Right
,
Edward
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Emily
,
with
animation
,
as
she
cast
her
eye
over
the
scene
,
and
felt
the
poetry
in
her
heart
giving
a
warm
glow
to
her
features
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Right
,
Edward
!
<EOS>
We
have
no
right
to
mar
so
joyful
a
scene
as
this
by
gloomy
thoughts
!
<EOS>
We
,
human
beings
,
the
noblest
creatures
of
Him
who
created
all!—creatures
endowed
with
reason
,
and
knowledge
to
comprehend
the
beauty
and
magnificence
of
His
works
!
<EOS>
alone
,
as
'
twere
,
too
,
with
great
Nature
herself
!
<EOS>
should
we
not
be
as
happy
as
these
sweet
warblers
that
comprehend
nothing
,
and
yet
sing
for
very
joy
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
"
she
continued
,
with
a
sparkling
eye
,
and
a
deeper
glow
on
her
sweet
features
,
while
her
very
form
seemed
to
expand
with
the
upreachings
of
a
full
,
a
noble
soul
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
these
very
songsters
rebuke
me
with
their
silvery
tones
,
for
being
east
down
,
and
seeing
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
is
black
and
cheerless
,
when
God
has
placed
me
in
a
world
so
bright
and
lovely
,
and
given
me
too
an
immortal
spirit
,
to
soar
when
done
with
these
into
a
brighter
and
more
glorious
realm
of
light
,
where
one
sad
thought
can
never
come
,
nor
pain
,
nor
aught
but
joy
eternal!""Ah
,
now
<EOS>
,
now
I
see
my
Emily
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Edward
,
joyfully
,
whose
eyes
,
bent
on
hers
,
were
sparkling
with
enthusiams
,
and
whose
features
were
radiant
with
delight
.
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
dear
Emily
,
go
on
!
<EOS>
I
could
listen
to
those
sweet
tones
forever!""Do
<EOS>
you
not
think
,
Edward
,
"
resumed
Emily
,
"
that
we
make
at
least
one
-
half
of
our
misery
by
letting
imagination
paint
dark
pictures
instead
of
bright
ones?""Ay
,
and
in
many
cases
all
,
"
answered
Merton
;
"
for
how
often
are
we
prone
to
imagine
dire
events
that
never
happen
,
and
in
that
imagination
undergo
more
real
misery
than
we
would
even
in
the
reality
itself
.
<EOS>
And
even
when
we
are
actually
suffering
,
if
we
look
closely
into
ourselves
,
we
shall
find
,
as
a
general
thing
,
that
that
very
suffering
rests
almost
entirely
in
the
manner
we
look
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Take
as
a
proof
of
this
,
the
terrible
fate
of
the
ancient
martyrs
—
who
,
when
hooted
and
reviled
at
by
a
barbarous
crowd
,
and
dragged
in
chains
to
the
stake
,
and
there
burnt
alive
,
sung
psalms
and
smiled
,
until
the
red
flames
,
more
mereiful
than
the
inhuman
monsters
around
,
released
them
.
<EOS>
Did
they
not
feel
the
pains
of
corporeal
punishment
?
<EOS>
They
were
flesh
and
blood
like
ourselves
,
and
just
as
sensitive
to
the
touch
;
but
still
they
believed
they
were
dying
in
a
holy
cause
,
and
hope
taught
them
to
look
beyond
the
present
,
and
,
aided
by
their
imagination
,
they
already
stood
on
the
very
threshold
of
Heaven
and
felt
happy
.
<EOS>
Let
us
then
,
Emily
,
if
the
present
seem
dark
,
take
a
lesson
from
those
martyrs
,
look
forward
with
bright
hope
to
the
future
,
and
thus
meet
our
troubles
with
a
smile!""Bright
hope
to
the
future
,
"
repeated
Emily
,
with
a
sigh
,
as
again
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
came
crowding
upon
her
;
"
the
future
in
spite
of
me
looks
dark
.
<EOS>
""Again
<EOS>
gloomy
,
Emily
,
"
returned
Merton
,
with
an
earnest
,
tender
look
;
"
<EOS>
you
who
were
wo
nt
to
be
so
buoyant
and
cheerful
;
there
is
some
deep
cause
for
this
,
Emily
,
and
I
would
fain
know
what
it
is
!
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
added
hastily
,
"
I
have
somewhat
to
tell
you
first
,
and
on
your
answer
perhaps
will
depend
my
right
to
question
you
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
slight
paleness
overspread
the
features
of
Emily
,
as
though
she
already
divined
the
nature
of
the
communication
,
her
hand
grasped
the
rein
tightly
,
and
there
was
a
slight
nervous
agitation
apparent
in
her
features
.
<EOS>
Recovering
herself
by
a
strong
effort
,
she
at
length
articulated
calmly
,
"
Go
on
,
Edward!""Not
here
,
"
said
Edward
.
<EOS>
"
Some
half
mile
,
in
this
direction
,
is
a
beautiful
spot
,
you
remember
,
near
a
murmuring
stream
,
where
we
once
whiled
away
two
of
the
sweetest
hours
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
there
,
Emily
,
for
no
other
place
seems
so
appropriate
.
"Emily
<EOS>
bowed
her
head
in
token
of
assent
,
and
for
some
time
rode
on
in
silence
,
while
Edward
kept
his
place
by
her
side
,
but
was
silent
also
.
<EOS>
—
About
a
quarter
of
a
mile
further
on
,
they
ascended
a
slight
elevation
,
which
commanded
a
fair
prospect
of
the
surrounding
country
,
for
a
goodly
distance
to
the
north
and
west
—
a
prospect
every
way
delightful
,
variegated
with
woods
and
plains
,
all
clothed
in
the
soft
green
robes
of
summer
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
some
sparkling
stream
winding
along
with
a
laughing
murmur
,
like
the
first
outpourings
of
a
young
,
free
heart
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
hot
and
somewhat
sultry
,
yet
as
their
course
had
been
mostly
through
a
deep
wood
,
it
had
not
been
particularly
oppressive
;
but
as
they
gazed
over
the
scene
described
,
each
thing
seemed
fairly
reeling
in
the
heat
,
while
the
sun
now
shone
bright
and
clear
upon
them
.
"How
<EOS>
beautiful
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Edward
,
shading
his
face
with
his
hand
,
to
let
his
eye
rest
for
a
moment
upon
the
landscape
.
<EOS>
"Very
,
very
beautiful
!
"
returned
Emily
,
drawing
rein
,
and
pausing
to
gaze
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
Emily
<EOS>
,
"
said
Edward
,
turning
to
her
,
"
do
not
tarry
here
—
the
heat
is
too
excessive
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Yonder
<EOS>
I
see
the
spot
,
which
,
since
I
rested
there
with
you
,
has
ever
lingered
in
my
memory
,
and
often
comes
up
in
my
dreams
,
like
a
something
too
bright
for
reality
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
be
there
again
with
you
,
even
though
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
was
a
tender
melancholy
in
the
voice
of
Edward
as
he
spoke
,
that
touched
the
heart
of
his
fair
hearer
,
and
caused
her
to
turn
her
head
away
with
a
sad
expression
—
but
she
returned
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Again
moving
onward
,
a
few
minutes
served
to
bring
them
to
the
place
mentioned
,
which
was
a
delightful
one
truly
,
and
seemed
just
fitted
for
an
arbor
of
love
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
flat
piece
of
ground
,
sloping
gently
to
the
north
,
shaded
by
tall
,
wide
-
branching
trees
,
and
free
from
underbrush
,
through
the
centre
of
which
glided
with
a
soothing
melody
,
a
clear
,
sparkling
streamlet
,
by
whose
side
lay
the
trunk
of
an
old
tree
,
fast
crumbling
back
to
that
dust
from
which
it
sprang
—
a
gentle
warning
,
as
'
twere
,
to
those
young
beings
now
approaching
,
that
at
the
longest
but
a
little
time
could
elapse
ere
a
similar
fate
would
be
theirs
.
<EOS>
The
ground
was
smooth
,
and
carpeted
with
rank
grass
,
interspersed
with
various
kinds
of
wild
flowers
,
which
added
a
beauty
to
what
must
even
otherwise
have
been
accounted
beautiful
.
<EOS>
—
Occasionally
throughout
the
grove
might
be
seen
some
gay
squirrel
,
bounding
merrily
away
with
a
ringing
chirup
,
while
handsome
plumed
birds
fluttered
and
sung
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
.
<EOS>
—
It
was
not
Paradise
,
and
yet
Paradise
need
scarcely
have
been
more
lovely
.
<EOS>
"Yonder
,
Emily
,
"
said
Edward
,
as
they
entered
the
grove
,
"
by
that
sweet
singing
streamlet
,
is
the
old
tree
which
served
us
for
a
seat
when
here
before
—
let
us
try
it
again
;
"
and
he
assisted
Emily
to
dismount
,
who
immediately
advanced
towards
it
with
a
trembling
step
and
a
palpitating
heart
,
for
she
felt
she
was
about
to
experience
the
most
trying
period
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Securing
his
horse
to
a
neighboring
tree
,
Merton
quickly
joined
her
.
<EOS>
"Here
,
"
he
resumed
,
in
a
voice
slightly
trembling
,
after
pausing
a
few
moments
to
collect
his
thoughts
,
and
,
if
truth
must
be
said
,
gain
courage
for
the
undertaking
;
"
here
,
Emily
,
where
we
are
alone
—
with
Nature
around
and
God
above
—
in
a
spot
that
is
lovely
enough
to
be
consecrated
to
love
and
all
things
holy
—
where
the
voice
of
man
but
seldom
intrudes
—
here
,
where
there
are
no
ears
to
listen
but
our
own
—
here
have
I
led
you
to
harken
to
my
tale
and
decide
my
fate
.
<EOS>
"Emily
<EOS>
bent
down
her
eyes
,
her
features
grew
pale
,
and
her
hands
trembled
—
but
she
answered
not
;
and
Edward
,
after
gazing
upon
her
a
moment
in
silence
,
again
resumed
.
<EOS>
"Two
years
since
,
Emily
,
as
you
are
aware
,
we
met
for
the
first
time
,
in
the
city
of
New
York
.
<EOS>
It
is
almost
needless
to
repeat
what
I
long
ere
this
have
told
you
,
and
more
than
once
,
that
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
knew
what
it
was
to
love
.
<EOS>
To
praise
each
particular
grace
or
charm
that
captivated
me
,
would
be
too
much
like
the
idle
flattery
of
the
world
;
suffice
,
that
I
saw
enough
in
you
to
win
my
affections
,
and
I
loved
you
—
<EOS>
loved
you
purely
—
as
I
never
more
can
love
another
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
too
,
and
not
without
cause
,
that
my
passion
was
returned
;
and
waiting
a
suitable
time
and
opportunity
,
I
declared
my
feelings
,
and
offered
you
my
hand
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
refuse
me
,
or
I
should
certainly
never
have
troubled
you
again
;
but
you
asked
if
my
parents
were
aware
of
this
;
and
on
my
replying
in
the
negative
,
said
that
perchance
they
would
refuse
their
consent
,
because
you
were
poor
;
that
we
were
both
too
young
to
fully
know
our
own
minds
;
that
in
an
undertaking
like
this
,
the
journeying
through
life
as
companions
,
we
should
be
well
assured
that
nothing
hereafter
would
cause
us
to
regret
having
chosen
hastily
;
that
time
would
be
the
proper
test
to
prove
whether
in
sincerity
we
both
loved
,
or
whether
it
was
merely
a
fancy
.
<EOS>
This
was
your
reply
;
and
although
I
was
then
fully
satisfied
that
for
one
I
should
never
so
love
another
,
yet
I
felt
the
force
of
your
answer
,
and
acquiesced
.
<EOS>
That
,
Emily
,
was
fifteen
months
ago
;
and
though
with
you
after
that
,
almost
daily
,
until
my
return
to
the
West
,
wherein
you
accompanied
me
—
and
very
often
in
your
society
since
—
yet
never
did
I
directly
speak
on
this
subject
again
,
till
the
evening
of
your
capture
,
when
I
again
asked
you
to
be
mine
—
again
offered
you
my
hand
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
refuse
me
then
—
no
,
you
even
told
me
you
loved
me
;
which
,
although
I
fully
believed
before
,
yet
hearing
from
your
own
sweet
lips
,
made
my
heart
bound
with
rapture
;
but
at
the
same
time
you
stated
you
were
poor
,
and
consequently
were
not
my
equal
in
this
;
and
that
you
could
not
consent
,
unless
assured
of
the
consent
of
my
parents
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
true
,
Emily
,
that
in
many
things
we
should
consult
and
take
the
advice
of
those
who
have
reared
us
from
infancy
—
but
it
does
not
follow
we
should
in
all
,
particularly
in
matters
of
the
heart
;
and
when
,
too
,
a
person
like
myself
has
arrived
at
the
age
of
discretion
,
and
knows
what
is
the
most
conducive
to
his
own
happiness
.
<EOS>
"Think
<EOS>
,
dear
Emily
,
think
even
for
a
moment
seriously
upon
it
,
and
your
kind
heart
will
tell
you
it
is
wrong
—
very
,
very
wrong
—
for
those
who
have
passed
,
or
are
passing
,
into
the
decline
of
life
,
and
have
lost
in
part
,
or
by
a
rude
contact
with
a
selfish
world
benumbed
,
those
fine
and
holy
feelings
of
love
,
which
entwining
around
the
heart
of
youth
,
soften
and
make
it
green
,
even
as
the
ivy
around
the
oak
adds
beauty
and
gentleness
to
its
appearance
;
wrong
,
I
say
,
for
those
to
dictate
to
the
young
—
who
are
full
of
the
joys
and
poetry
of
the
morning
of
life
—
where
they
shall
give
their
hand
;
and
this
,
too
,
when
mercenary
considerations
are
their
ruling
motives
for
so
doing
;
and
by
this
make
them
unhappy
,
and
destroy
all
the
sweets
of
existence
—
forcing
them
to
sigh
for
the
final
rest
of
the
cold
and
silent
grave
.
<EOS>
Think
upon
it
,
Emily
,
and
how
inconsistent
does
it
appear
.
<EOS>
What
has
money
to
do
with
the
heart
?
<EOS>
Can
it
ease
one
pang
?
<EOS>
Can
it
still
one
pulsation
?
<EOS>
Can
it
make
us
forget
to
think
upon
the
past
—
upon
those
we
have
loved
?
<EOS>
Can
it
make
us
escape
ourselves
?
<EOS>
Can
it
procure
us
a
higher
seat
in
Heaven
?
<EOS>
Can
it
add
to
our
devotions
to
an
all
-
seeing
God
?
<EOS>
Can
it
purchase
one
really
happy
moment
?
<EOS>
No
,
dear
Emily
,
it
can
do
none
of
these
.
<EOS>
Then
wherefore
<EOS>
should
we
make
ourselves
miserable
—
<EOS>
wherefore
throw
away
the
happiness
already
in
our
grasp
,
for
its
weight
of
misery
,
even
though
a
mine
of
gold
be
put
in
the
balance
?
<EOS>
And
then
,
too
,
how
inconsistent
that
we
should
be
forced
into
these
measures
by
those
who
should
seek
our
happiness
?
—
who
,
as
I
said
before
,
are
rapidly
approaching
old
age
and
dissolution
,
and
whom
we
have
a
right
to
suppose
,
by
the
regular
order
of
events
,
will
long
precede
us
to
the
tomb,—how
inconsistent
that
we
should
be
made
wretched
to
please
them
,
who
will
soon
leave
us
alone
,
to
drink
deep
of
sorrow
,
and
entail
it
upon
our
posterity
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
dear
Emily
,
this
should
not
be
!
<EOS>
Parents
may
advise
in
such
matters
,
but
they
have
no
right
,
by
the
laws
of
either
God
or
man
,
to
usurp
authority
,
and
become
dictators
and
tyrants
!
<EOS>
So
soon
as
they
do
this
,
they
overstep
their
proper
limits
,
and
sever
the
tie
of
consanguinity
.
<EOS>
"Edward
<EOS>
spoke
gently
,
in
a
calm
,
earnest
,
musical
tone
,
with
his
head
turned
towards
Emily
,
and
his
dark
hazel
eye
resting
tenderly
upon
her
while
she
,
as
he
went
on
,
becoming
deeply
interested
,
gradually
raised
her
head
,
and
now
sat
with
her
soft
blue
eyes
looking
with
a
mournful
sweetness
into
his
,
with
that
peculiar
expression
which
can
never
be
mistaken
for
other
than
one
of
love
.
<EOS>
Edward
noticed
these
changes
with
a
beating
heart
—
for
he
fancied
in
them
were
favorable
augeries
to
his
fondest
hopes
—
and
with
a
cheek
slightly
flushed
,
and
a
voice
perhaps
a
little
more
passionate
,
he
still
went
on
.
<EOS>
"Such
,
dear
Emily
,
as
I
have
pointed
out
as
most
reprehensible
in
parents
,
are
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
the
ruling
motives
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
say
aught
to
wrong
those
who
gave
me
birth
—
who
watched
over
me
in
infancy
,
and
reared
me
in
affluence
—
no
,
far
be
it
from
me
to
do
this
,
or
willingly
wound
their
feelings
;
yet
as
much
as
I
may
love
and
respect
them
,
I
must
respect
myself
,
nor
allow
myself
to
be
sold
for
gold
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
interrupt
me
not
—
I
see
you
do
not
understand
,
so
listen!"My
father
is
wealthy
—
very
wealthy
—
and
might
,
were
he
so
disposed
,
do
much
good
,
and
make
many
a
poor
being
around
him
,
as
well
as
his
own
son
,
happy
.
<EOS>
But
alas
and
alas
,
dear
Emily
,
he
has
made
money
his
God
—
at
whose
shrine
he
sacrifices
all
those
high
and
noble
feelings
,
which
,
rightly
exercised
,
almost
make
a
god
of
man
!
<EOS>
Without
seeking
to
know
my
feelings
on
the
subject
,
he
has
,
in
his
ambitious
dreams
,
bestowed
my
hand
where
my
heart
is
not
,
upon
one
whose
sufficient
merit
in
his
eyes
,
is
,
that
she
can
more
than
balance
the
scale
with
him
in
gold
.
<EOS>
—
You
grow
pale
,
Emily
—
but
fear
not
,
sweet
one
,
and
listen!"When
I
parted
with
you
on
that
eventful
night
,
I
did
so
with
the
determination
of
telling
my
father
all
,
and
gaining
,
if
possible
,
his
consent
to
our
union
.
<EOS>
To
this
end
I
seized
upon
the
first
opportunity
,
when
in
private
,
and
began
my
story
.
<EOS>
But
alas
,
Emily
,
all
hope
of
that
was
soon
over
!
<EOS>
He
heard
me
but
a
few
moments
,
and
then
in
rage
spurned
me
from
his
presence
,
and
said
that
did
I
marry
without
his
consent
,
he
would
both
disown
and
disinherit
me
,
and
that
his
consent
should
never
be
given
to
my
union
with
one
poorer
than
himself
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
not
he
was
my
father
,
and
quitted
his
sight
without
reply
—
never
to
speak
with
him
on
the
like
again
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
dear
Emily
,
my
fate
rests
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
sought
you
to
tell
you
all
,
and
offer
you
once
more
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
,
for
your
sweet
sake
,
I
have
not
wealth
to
offer
—
for
my
own
<EOS>
I
care
not
.
<EOS>
I
am
young
,
and
strong
,
and
thank
God
,
I
have
a
good
education
,
which
,
with
proper
energy
,
will
enable
me
to
go
through
the
world
with
ease
,
if
I
but
have
one
sweet
being
to
cheer
me
on
!
<EOS>
Wealth
<EOS>
I
do
not
seek
—
I
may
add
,
do
not
want
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
willing
to
share
with
me
the
struggles
of
life
—
the
good
and
ill—'tis
all
I
ask
to
make
me
happy
;
and
to
make
you
so
,
dear
Emily
,
I
will
toil
early
and
late
—
will
be
ambitious
,
and
seek
to
win
a
name
you
shall
be
proud
of
.
<EOS>
"Ponder
<EOS>
well
,
dear
Emily
,
ere
you
decide
—
and
let
no
false
notions
of
the
world
,
what
it
will
think
or
say
,
sway
you
now
—
for
by
your
answer
I
shall
abide
.
<EOS>
Remember
on
the
words
which
you
are
about
to
utter
hang
the
destiny
of
both
;
and
once
said
,
are
registered
in
God
's
book
in
Heaven
,
and
beyond
recall
!
<EOS>
You
have
had
time
sufficient
ere
this
,
to
know
your
own
mind
,
and
whether
you
will
be
content
to
be
mine
,
even
while
dark
clouds
are
lowering
around
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
poor
,
remember
so
am
I
,
and
therefore
in
this
shall
be
your
equal
;
<EOS>
but
above
all
,
dear
Emily
,
if
you
have
any
hesitation
,
I
charge
you
think
well
—
think
well
—
<EOS>
ere
you
pronounce
the
sentence
which
shall
sever
us
forever!—for
<EOS>
if
you
reject
me
now
,
in
this
world
we
shall
never
,
never
meet
again
;
and
whatever
my
unhappy
fate
may
be
,
it
shall
be
yours
to
bear
with
you
,
even
to
your
bed
of
death
,
the
solemn
reflection
that
it
was
once
in
your
power
to
have
elevated
and
made
me
happy
!
<EOS>
I
have
done
,
dear
Emily
,
and
tremblingly
listen
for
your
reply
.
<EOS>
"During
<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
his
remarks
,
Emily
's
head
had
sunk
upon
her
breast
,
her
eyes
were
bent
down
,
while
her
cheeks
paled
and
flushed
alternately
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
after
the
mournful
cadence
of
his
loved
voice
had
ceased
to
sound
in
her
ear
,
she
sat
mute
,
and
,
save
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
slight
tremor
,
immovable
<EOS>
;
while
Edward
,
with
his
eyes
intently
fastened
upon
her
,
gazed
as
one
who
awaits
an
answer
of
life
or
death
.
<EOS>
At
length
Emily
,
in
a
low
voice
,
without
raising
her
head
,
articulated:"Have
<EOS>
you
considered
,
Edward
,
that
I
am
almost
a
homeless
wanderer
,
who
knows
nothing
of
my
parentage?""I
have
considered
all
,
dear
Emily
—
everything
—
for
this
with
me
has
been
no
hasty
undertaking
.
<EOS>
""Then
take
me
,
Edward
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
,
impulsively
,
suddenly
looking
up
,
and
turning
her
soft
blue
eyes
,
moist
with
tears
,
sweetly
upon
him
:
—
"
Take
me
,
<EOS>
dear
Edward
,
I
am
thine
,
thine
forever!""Bless
you
,
bless
you
,
my
own
,
dearest
Emily
,
for
those
sweet
,
sweet
words
!
"
and
bounding
forward
,
Edward
caught
her
in
his
arms
,
strained
her
for
a
few
moments
to
his
heart
in
silence
,
and
then
bending
down
,
impressed
upon
her
soft
lips
the
first
rapturous
,
hely
kiss
of
love
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
moment
of
bliss
to
be
felt
,
but
never
to
be
described
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
I
came
here
,
dear
Edward
,
"
said
Emily
,
at
length
,
gazing
up
into
his
face
with
a
look
of
love
,
while
she
still
reclined
against
his
breast
<EOS>
,
"
it
was
to
tell
you
we
must
part
;
but
you
have
conquered
,
and
henceforth
and
forever
I
am
thine
.
<EOS>
"Edward
,
his
soul
too
full
to
vent
itself
in
idle
words
,
again
strained
her
to
his
heart
in
silence
,
while
the
soft
voice
of
the
bright
streamlet
that
colled
sweetly
along
at
their
feet
,
sent
up
a
quiet
melody
that
found
an
echo
in
the
hearts
of
both
.
<EOS>
Seating
themselves
once
more
upon
the
fallen
tree
,
Edward
and
Emily
,
fresh
in
the
mutual
and
holy
confidence
of
two
hearts
pledged
to
one
destiny
,
passed
two
bright
hours
unheeded
,
in
the
interchange
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
awakened
in
the
breasts
of
each
.
<EOS>
We
say
two
bright
hours
unheeded
—
for
when
did
love
take
note
of
time
?
<EOS>
Had
the
two
hours
been
four
,
to
them
it
had
been
the
same
,
and
would
have
seemed
but
as
many
minutes
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
time
mentioned
,
however
,
they
were
aroused
to
a
consciousness
of
the
outer
world
,
by
hearing
the
booming
sound
of
heavy
thunder
;
and
on
looking
up
with
a
start
,
from
a
conversation
the
most
happy
,
they
were
surprised
to
find
it
already
growing
dark
,
from
the
black
heavy
clouds
of
an
approaching
storm
having
already
obscured
the
rays
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
density
of
a
wood
covering
a
hill
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
streamlet
,
our
lovers
were
unable
to
obtain
a
view
of
the
shower
,
which
was
approaching
from
that
direction
.
<EOS>
"Ha
<EOS>
,
that
is
near
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Merton
,
starting
to
his
feet
,
as
following
not
long
after
a
bright
flash
,
came
the
heavy
booming
of
another
peal
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
make
all
haste
home
,
Emily
,
or
we
shall
be
caught
in
the
rain
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
again
,
pointing
to
the
west
,
"
I
see
the
point
of
an
angry
cloud
just
rising
over
the
brow
of
yon
hill
.
<EOS>
The
storm
is
nearer
than
I
thought
.
<EOS>
Come
,
dear
Emily
,
let
us
haste
—
let
us
haste
;
"
and
seizing
her
by
the
hand
as
he
spoke
,
both
sprang
quickly
towards
the
horse
,
which
stood
some
twenty
paces
distant
,
with
his
bridle
-
rein
made
fast
to
the
limb
of
a
tree
.
<EOS>
Whether
their
sudden
movements
startled
him
,
or
whether
he
was
just
at
this
instant
stung
by
some
insect
,
matters
not
;
but
scarcely
had
our
lovers
advanced
to
within
ten
paces
of
the
animal
,
when
he
threw
himself
suddenly
back
,
and
pulled
with
all
his
force
upon
the
bridle
.
<EOS>
Merton
instantly
darted
forward
,
but
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
rein
broke
,
and
with
a
roguish
shake
of
the
head
,
and
a
slight
neigh
,
Sir
Harry
bounded
gaily
away
.
<EOS>
"How
unfortunate
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Merton
;
"
just
at
this
moment
too
when
time
is
so
precious
.
<EOS>
But
be
not
alarmed
,
Emily
,
he
will
not
go
far
,
and
I
will
soon
overtake
him
.
<EOS>
Stay
you
here
.
<EOS>
In
five
minutes
I
will
be
with
you
;
and
then
we
must
both
ride
,
and
ride
hard!""Be
<EOS>
sure
you
be
not
long
,
"
returned
Emily
,
in
a
voice
that
trembled
from
a
sudden
fear
she
could
not
account
for
,
while
her
cheeks
grew
pale
from
the
same
cause
;
"
be
sure
you
be
not
long
,
Edward!"As
<EOS>
the
latter
predicted
,
the
beast
did
not
go
far
;
for
from
the
gallop
in
which
he
set
off
,
he
shortly
slackened
to
a
trot
,
finally
paused
altogether
,
and
amused
himself
by
cropping
some
herbage
until
his
master
came
up
,
which
,
notwithstanding
,
occupied
some
minutes
.
<EOS>
Hastily
tying
together
the
broken
reins
,
Edward
threw
them
over
Sir
Harry
's
neck
,
bounded
upon
the
saddle
,
and
rode
quickly
back
to
where
he
had
left
Emily
;
but
,
strange
to
say
,
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
At
first
astonishment
siezed
upon
Merton
that
she
should
absent
herself
at
such
a
critical
time
;
but
astonishment
soon
gave
way
to
alarm
—
alarm
to
horror
—
<EOS>
when
on
calling
her
name
loudly
several
times
no
answer
was
returned
but
the
gloomy
echo
of
his
own
voice
.
<EOS>
What
could
it
mean
—
where
had
she
gone
,
and
what
terrible
fate
had
befallen
her
,
that
she
did
not
return
?
<EOS>
were
questions
which
he
asked
himself
with
a
wildness
bordering
upon
insanity
,
while
he
rode
up
and
down
and
through
the
grove
,
still
calling
at
the
extent
of
his
voice
her
dearly
loved
name
.
<EOS>
Could
she
have
been
seized
by
some
wild
beast
?
<EOS>
Edward
thought
,
and
shuddered
,
and
felt
his
brain
reel
.
<EOS>
He
sprang
from
his
horse
and
examined
the
ground
around
where
she
had
stood
—
<EOS>
but
no
,
there
were
no
marks
of
blood
or
violence
;
besides
,
had
this
been
the
case
,
he
would
have
heard
her
screams
.
<EOS>
What
could
it
mean
?
<EOS>
Springing
upon
his
horse
again
,
for
some
three
quarters
of
an
hour
he
rode
wildly
to
and
fro
,
calling
upon
her
sweet
name
—
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
in
vain
—
she
answered
not
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
shower
had
been
steadily
approaching
,
and
already
now
a
few
large
drops
,
precursors
of
what
was
to
follow
,
fell
with
a
rattling
sound
upon
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Night
advancing
also
,
had
already
began
to
robe
objects
in
her
sombre
mantle
,
while
the
lightning
flashed
fiercely
,
and
the
thunder
followed
quickly
,
crash
on
crash
.
<EOS>
Merton
,
forced
into
the
belief
that
a
longer
search
was
useless
,
and
hurried
away
by
the
storm
and
a
faint
hope
that
she
might
,
fearing
delay
while
he
was
absent
,
have
started
for
home
,
alone
,
now
buried
the
rowels
in
the
animal
's
sides
;
and
although
the
distance
was
three
good
miles
,
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
his
horse
stood
panting
at
Webber
's
door
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
it
had
become
very
dark
,
and
the
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
,
while
the
lightning
flashed
and
the
thunder
roared
as
incessantly
as
ever
.
<EOS>
The
party
had
just
returned
,
and
their
horses
were
still
standing
in
front
of
the
cottage
,
where
they
had
been
left
until
the
storm
should
abate
.
<EOS>
Webber
was
standing
in
the
door
.
<EOS>
"Has
<EOS>
Emily
arrived
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Edward
,
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
Edward
,
"
exclaimed
he
,
"
is
she
not
with
you
?
<EOS>
Speak
—
speak!""Oh
God
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Merton
,
wringing
his
hands
in
agony
<EOS>
,
"
she
is
lost
—
she
is
lost!""Lost
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Webber
,
rushing
forth
;
"
great
God
!
<EOS>
what
mean
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
a
few
hurried
words
Merton
explained
what
had
chanced
,
while
Bernard
,
Tyrone
and
Mrs.
Webber
,
hearing
the
exclamations
,
reached
the
door
in
time
to
learn
all
.
<EOS>
"Mount
<EOS>
—
mount
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Webber
,
springing
upon
one
of
the
horses
,
while
Bernard
and
Tyrone
quickly
followed
his
example
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mount
and
away
,
for
we
must
find
her
!
"
<EOS>
A
minute
later
,
all
four
were
riding
as
if
for
life
—
Merton
in
advance
.
<EOS>
A
groan
drew
Mrs.
Webber
's
attention
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
room
she
found
Rufus
had
fainted
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
enough
to
know
that
Emily
was
lost
,
and
that
,
as
he
had
predicted
,
they
would
never
meet
again
on
earth
.
<EOS>
The
search
of
the
party
proved
fruitless
,
and
towards
morning
they
returned
.
<EOS>
It
was
renewed
the
next
day
,
and
the
next
,
and
the
next
;
and
yet
on
the
third
night
they
had
found
no
traces
—
gleaned
no
tidings
of
Emily
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
severe
blow
to
all
—
to
Webber
and
Merton
in
particular
.
<EOS>
Leaving
them
to
their
search
,
however
,
in
ignorance
of
her
fate
,
we
will
turn
to
the
cause
of
our
fair
heroine
's
sudden
and
mysterious
disappearance
,
and
the
wherefore
she
did
not
return
.

THE
CONSEQUENCES.Scarcely
had
Edward
departed
,
and
while
Emily
stood
gazing
on
his
retreating
form
,
with
a
secret
fear
,
the
cause
of
which
she
was
unable
to
divine
,
when
two
figures
,
their
faces
concealed
by
masks
,
approached
her
stealthily
from
behind
,
threw
a
bandage
over
her
mouth
to
prevent
her
cries
for
help
,
raised
her
in
their
brawny
arms
,
and
,
without
a
word
,
bore
her
speedily
away
—
<EOS>
directly
past
the
fallen
tree
,
where
she
had
but
a
few
minutes
before
in
a
happy
confidence
plighted
herself
to
him
she
loved
—
across
the
silvery
stream
that
had
the
while
sung
its
seeming
song
of
love
—
up
into
the
dark
wood
of
the
hill
beyond
.
<EOS>
Here
for
a
moment
they
paused
to
rest
,
and
then
,
without
speaking
,
again
bore
her
onward
some
three
hundred
yards
,
still
deeper
into
the
wood
,
and
farther
from
him
who
should
have
been
there
to
protect
her
.
<EOS>
When
they
paused
again
,
it
was
beside
two
powerful
horses
,
on
one
of
which
she
was
instantly
mounted
in
front
of
one
of
her
captors
,
while
his
companion
,
springing
into
the
sad
dle
,
led
the
way
,
as
fast
as
the
ground
would
permit
,
in
a
westerly
direction
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Emily
heard
in
the
distance
the
voice
of
Edward
calling
upon
her
name
,
and
a
keen
pang
shot
through
her
soul
.
<EOS>
Her
captors
heard
it
also
,
but
with
very
different
feelings
;
for
the
one
in
advance
,
turning
to
his
companion
,
said:"We
's
jest
in
time
<EOS>
Saxton
,
for
if
we
'd
a
been
a
little
sooner
or
a
little
later
,
we
'd
a
have
to
put
a
veto
on
the
tune
of
that
ar
'
gentleman
—
<EOS>
and
you
know
that
was
strictly
agin
orders
.
<EOS>
""Right
<EOS>
,
Niles
,
we
jest
hit
the
proper
moment
;
but
is
n't
that
the
feller
what
frightened
you
off
in
the
morning
,
afore
you
'd
got
the
old
gentleman
fairly
tied?""Why
<EOS>
that
's
the
chap
that
rode
up
,
it
's
true
;
but
I
do
n't
like
the
idea
of
your
callin
'
<EOS>
it
frightened
off
—
for
if
it
had
n't
a
bin
<EOS>
you
know
,
that
we
was
n't
to
hurt
him
<EOS>
,
I
'd
a
made
a
different
business
on't
altogether
.
<EOS>
As
'
twas
,
I
thought
I
'd
run
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
git
<EOS>
shot?""Yes
<EOS>
,
so
it
turned
out
it
seems
—
though
I
only
lost
two
fingers
by
the
operation
,
and
by
—
!
<EOS>
I
'll
be
even
for
them
<EOS>
yit
,
if
I
live
long
enough
.
<EOS>
—
But
you
did
n't
do
anything
to
brag
on
,
in
lettin
them
<EOS>
ar
'
two
fellers
whip
three
on
ye
,
and
kill
one
at
that!"The
other
replied
only
by
uttering
a
terrible
oath
,
and
setting
his
teeth
hard
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
resumed
Niles
,
"
it
was
an
ugly
business
,
take
it
all
round
,
and
we
got
the
worst
on'tBill
was
killed
—
<EOS>
Jack
had
his
face
badly
battered
,
and
another
ball
through
his
arm
,
which
may
be
'll
do
him
too
—
you
got
a
sore
head
,
and
I
lost
two
fingers
;
while
Besley
,
whose
legs
was
a
leetle
the
longest
,
got
off
clear
.
<EOS>
But
I
say
,
Sax
.
,
jest
tie
a
handkerchief
over
that
ar
'
gal
's
eyes
,
<EOS>
so
she
ca
n't
examine
directions
<EOS>
,
you
know
that
's
orders
,
and
then
let
's
ride
—
for
ye
see
its
gittin
'
dark
in
these
ere
woods
,
and
a
big
shower
to
back
it
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
a
moment
Emily
found
her
eyes
bandaged
,
and
then
she
could
feel
the
horses
urged
on
to
greater
speed
,
while
peal
on
peal
,
each
nearer
than
the
last
,
came
to
her
ear
the
thunder
of
the
approaching
storm
.
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
felt
it
was
useless
to
struggle
against
her
destiny
,
whatever
it
might
be
,
and
commending
herself
to
the
care
of
Him
who
watches
alike
over
the
powerful
and
defenceless
,
she
resigned
herself
to
her
fate
.
<EOS>
Her
captors
had
again
become
silent
,
and
on
,
on
they
rode
for
some
half
hour
,
as
fast
as
the
beasts
could
carry
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
time
mentioned
,
they
came
to
a
halt
by
some
dwelling
,
and
Emily
could
hear
the
low
murmur
of
several
other
voices
in
hurried
conversation
.
<EOS>
At
length
one
more
loud
,
and
in
dictation
,
struck
her
ear
with
a
familiar
sound
,
and
fairly
made
her
blood
run
cold
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
voice
of
John
Webber
.
<EOS>
"You
will
stop
here
and
refresh
until
this
storm
has
passed
,
which
it
will
have
done
in
less
than
two
hours
,
and
then
you
must
mount
and
on
again
till
you
reach
the
point
designated
,
for
this
side
of
there
<EOS>
it
will
not
do
to
remain
.
<EOS>
I
must
return
this
night
,
or
I
may
be
suspected
.
<EOS>
Jack
is
too
badly
wounded
to
be
your
company
.
<EOS>
Between
ourselves
,
I
fear
his
day
is
over
.
<EOS>
Hetty
will
go
with
you
,
and
in
her
charge
you
can
trust
her
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
route
,
so
that
you
can
follow
it
in
the
night
,
do
you
not?""We
do
,
"
answered
the
voice
of
Niles
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
your
parts
have
been
admirably
performed
.
<EOS>
Complete
as
well
,
and
you
shall
have
a
suitable
reward
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
your
services
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
come
,
dismount
and
enter
,
for
already
the
rain
I
see
approaching
.
<EOS>
Feed
well
your
horses
.
<EOS>
I
must
this
moment
away
.
<EOS>
"
As
the
voice
concluded
,
Emily
heard
the
tramping
of
another
horse
,
fast
growing
distant
,
and
felt
herself
seized
and
borne
under
some
shelter
,
on
which
,
a
few
moments
after
,
the
rain
dashed
violently
,
while
she
was
almost
stunned
by
the
oft
repeated
crashing
of
the
thunder
.
<EOS>
The
storm
raged
for
upwards
of
an
hour
,
and
then
ceased
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
two
hours
,
Emily
was
again
mounted
,
and
borne
away
,
while
she
became
aware
of
the
party
being
increased
by
an
additional
member
—
a
woman
—
which
was
at
all
events
some
consolation
,
although
she
could
neither
speak
nor
see
,
owing
to
the
bandages
being
still
kept
around
her
mouth
and
eyes
.
<EOS>
On
,
on
the
party
dashed
;
now
up
some
steep
bluff
;
now
down
into
some
deep
dingle
;
now
through
a
forest
and
tangled
brushwood
;
now
over
a
barren
,
sandy
,
open
plain
;
now
through
streams
whose
waters
swollen
by
the
late
rain
rolled
on
with
a
sullen
murmur
—
on
,
on
they
went
,
heeding
no
obstruction
,
rarely
ever
speaking
to
each
other
;
on
,
on
—
still
on
—
while
hour
after
hour
went
by
,
and
yet
no
pause
.
<EOS>
At
length
they
halted
once
more
to
gain
some
refreshment
,
and
Emily
felt
herself
removed
from
the
horse
she
had
ridden
to
another
,
and
again
they
went
on
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
wearied
by
excitement
and
travel
,
Emily
,
in
spite
of
her
struggles
to
the
contrary
,
gradually
sunk
into
the
arms
of
Morpheus
,
and
for
the
time
her
trials
and
troubles
were
forgotten
.
<EOS>
As
when
we
fall
asleep
in
some
quiet
spot
with
no
sounds
near
,
a
gentle
shake
or
noise
will
wake
us
,
so
when
we
sink
into
slumber
amid
confusion
,
silence
will
produce
the
same
effect
—
and
Emily
was
awakened
by
the
party
again
coming
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
On
opening
her
eyes
—
for
during
the
latter
part
of
her
ride
the
bandage
around
them
had
fallen
off
—
she
found
herself
in
a
wild
,
mountainous
region
,
with
nothing
cheering
around
,
no
habitation
and
no
human
beings
near
—
save
,
in
the
first
instance
,
a
kind
of
half
cave
and
hovel
in
the
side
of
a
steep
mountain
,
formed
of
wood
,
rocks
and
clay
;
and
,
in
the
last
,
the
rough
,
ugly
visages
of
her
two
captors
,
and
the
face
of
Hetty
Brogan
,
whom
she
recognised
with
a
thrill
of
joy
,
from
the
fact
that
she
was
a
woman
,
and
that
her
face
was
familiar
,
although
she
had
never
seen
it
but
once
before
,
and
then
under
circumstances
by
no
means
pleasant
;
still
it
was
at
least
the
face
of
a
woman
,
one
too
she
had
seen
before
,
and
it
gave
her
joy
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
we
're
here
at
last
,
Saxton
,
"
said
Niles
;
"
though
we
've
had
a
tolerable
tough
night
on't
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
we
've
had
all
o
'
that
,
Niles
,
and
I
reckon
as
how
he
'll
have
to
pay
well
for't
.
<EOS>
See
,
the
sun
already
shines
on
yonder
hill
,
and
we
've
traveled
all
night
.
<EOS>
Our
poor
horses
,
as
well
as
us
,
are
confoundedly
tired
,
although
we
've
changed
once
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
Well
,
let
's
in
with
the
gal
and
be
off
—
that
's
all
o
'
<EOS>
our
part
,
you
know
,
for
Hetty'll
have
to
tend
to
the
rest
.
<EOS>
About
five
miles
from
here
's
a
good
place
for
feedin
'
and
restin
'
<EOS>
,
so
let
's
be
a
movin
'
;
"
and
dismounting
while
speaking
,
Saxton
assisted
Emily
to
do
the
same
,
while
Hetty
,
following
his
example
,
threw
her
bridle
rein
to
Niles
,
who
still
remained
in
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
"
Thar
'
,
Hetty
,
"
continued
Saxton
,
turning
to
her
,
and
pointing
to
Emily
,
"
you
'll
be
responsible
for
the
rest
;
so
good
bye
,
old
woman
;
"
and
springing
upon
his
horse
again
,
he
turned
away
and
rode
slowly
down
the
hill
,
followed
by
Niles
,
who
also
led
the
beast
which
had
borne
Hetty
hither
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
glad
you
're
gone
,
"
said
Hetty
,
gazing
after
them
with
no
very
amiable
expression
<EOS>
;
"
for
I
can
al'ays
breathe
a
great
deal
easier
when
you
do
n't
breathe
the
same
air
.
<EOS>
Come
,
lady
,
you
've
had
a
hard
ride
for
one
of
your
tender
breeding
;
"
and
Hetty
turned
to
Emily
with
a
compassionate
look
,
"
and
you
're
pale
and
troubled
,
gal
;
so
come
,
come
,
let
's
in
;
but
stop
,
they
sha
n't
keep
that
ar
'
thing
round
your
jaws
no
longer
;
"
and
Hetty
removed
the
bandage
from
Emily
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
Hetty
,
good
Hetty
,
"
cried
Emily
,
in
an
entreating
tone
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
good
Hetty
,
where
am
I
,
and
why
was
I
brought
hither
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
speak
,
speak
,
and
tell
me
,
good
Hetty!""Thar
'
,
thar
'
,
jest
stop
now
,
and
do
n't
go
to
calling
me
good
Hetty
,
'cause
I
arn't
no
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
I
haint
did
nothin'
good
for
more'n
sixteen
year
,
so
do
n't
call
me
good
!
<EOS>
But
come
,
gal
,
come
,
let
's
in
;
"
and
taking
Emily
by
the
hand
,
she
led
the
way
into
the
hovel
-
cave
<EOS>
just
mentioned
,
without
giving
her
a
word
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
gloomy
place
—
part
natural
,
part
artificial
—
in
one
of
the
wildest
and
most
dismal
spots
to
be
found
on
the
mountains
lining
the
banks
of
the
Osage
.
<EOS>
It
had
evidently
but
just
been
constructed
or
refitted
,
for
the
earth
within
—
the
only
floor
it
could
boast
—
was
soft
and
fresh
,
as
though
lately
placed
there
by
the
spade
.
<EOS>
The
roof
was
formed
of
a
large
projecting
rock
,
partly
embedded
in
the
mountain
,
and
the
sides
and
front
of
stones
,
brush
and
earth
thrown
compactly
together
.
<EOS>
It
could
boast
a
rude
door
,
which
was
,
with
the
exception
of
two
loop
holes
,
the
only
place
to
admit
light
and
air
.
<EOS>
Within
was
a
rough
table
,
whereon
lay
a
tinder
box
and
candle
—
one
or
two
rough
benches
made
of
logs
—
and
a
rude
pen
at
one
end
,
filled
with
straw
,
which
was
to
answer
the
purpose
of
a
bed
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
apartment
into
which
Hetty
and
Emily
now
entered
—
the
latter
with
feelings
of
horror
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
Hetty
,
"
exclaimed
Emily
,
as
she
glanced
around
,
"
I
beseech
<EOS>
you
tell
me
what
this
means
,
and
why
I
have
been
stolen
from
home
and
brought
hither!""'Pon
my
soul
,
lady
,
"
answered
Hetty
,
"
I
do
n't
know
no
more'n
<EOS>
you
do
!
<EOS>
We
poor
womens
has
to
obey
orders
sometimes
without
asking
questions
;
and
all
I
knows
is
,
that
I
've
got
to
tend
'
pon
ye
till
he
comes
.
<EOS>
""Who
comes
?
"
cried
Emily
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
that
ar
'
young
man
as
had
you
stolen
.
<EOS>
""Was
<EOS>
it
John
Webber
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Emily
,
breathlessly
.
"Why
<EOS>
ye
see
I
arn't
to
mention
names
,
'cause
its
agin
orders
.
<EOS>
You
might
guess
worse
,
though
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
""Oh
Heaven
,
'
tis
he
!
"
exclaimed
Emily
,
clasping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
I
feared
,
I
feared
'
twas
so
!
<EOS>
—
Base
,
base
man
<EOS>
,
he
designs
to
work
my
ruin
!
<EOS>
Oh
God
,
Father
of
the
innocent
and
defenceless
,
I
pray
thee
protect
me
in
this
trying
hour
,
and
deliver
me
from
the
hands
of
those
who
would
do
me
wrong!""I
do
n't
think
as
how
he
means
to
hurt
you
,
lady
,
"
said
Hetty
;
"
<EOS>
though
'
twixt
us
I
think
he
's
a
bad
man
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
he
did
not
wish
to
do
me
wrong
,
why
did
he
tear
me
away
from
those
I
love
,
and
bear
me
beyond
the
reach
of
friends
?
"
asked
Emily
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
ca
n't
answer
ye
,
"
replied
Hetty
;
"
and
besides
,
I
've
broke
orders
in
what
I
've
done
already
—
<EOS>
so
you
<EOS>
musn't
<EOS>
ask
me
no
more
questions
,
gal
,
'cause
I
'll
have
to
refuse
to
speak
to
ye!""Heaven
help
me
!
"
<EOS>
groaned
Emily
;
and
casting
herself
upon
one
of
the
benches
,
she
bowed
her
face
in
her
hands
and
wept
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hate
to
see
ye
cry
,
lady
,
"
said
Hetty
,
in
a
softened
tone
;
"
I
do
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
she
gazed
upon
Emily
,
her
brown
,
ugly
,
weather
-
beaten
features
assumed
an
expression
of
tender
compassion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
,
gal
!
<EOS>
I
sometimes
tell
fortins
.
<EOS>
"Emily
<EOS>
mechanically
obeyed
,
and
Hetty
,
after
looking
on
the
palm
of
it
a
moment
,
continued
:
—
"
<EOS>
Thar
's
trouble
here
,
gal
,
and
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
lines
is
crossed
and
cut
up
badly
;
but
thar
's
one
,
the
line
of
life
,
as
runs
out
on't
smoothly
—
so
do
n't
be
afeard
,
cause
it
'll
all
turn
out
right
in
the
end
,
depend
on't!""But
<EOS>
when
is
he
to
come
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Emily
,
not
heeding
the
last
remarks
of
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"Thar
'
,
I
sha
n't
answer
ye
no
more
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Hetty
,
who
felt
offended
that
her
fortune
telling
powers
had
been
thus
slighted
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
answer
ye
agin
,
so
do
n't
speak
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
true
to
her
word
,
from
that
moment
Emily
could
get
nothing
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
Left
to
herself
and
her
own
gloomy
reflections
—
apprehending
something
terrible
to
come
—
with
Emily
,
the
day
,
as
might
be
conjectured
,
wore
wearily
away
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
to
happen
?
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
her
fate
—
away
from
home
and
friends
,
and
no
voice
to
whisper
in
her
ear
a
single
word
of
consolation
and
hope
?
<EOS>
And
John
—
a
man
she
believed
capable
of
any
act
however
devilish
—
what
was
his
design
upon
her
?
<EOS>
She
remembered
his
dark
,
mysterious
words
of
threatening
,
and
shuddered
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
why
had
she
not
made
them
known
,
and
been
saved
this
terrible
result
?
<EOS>
And
Edward
,
what
must
be
his
feelings
to
find
her
gone
so
suddenly
,
and
no
trace
left
whereby
he
could
glean
an
inkling
of
her
fate
?
<EOS>
And
her
guardian
too
<EOS>
,
how
must
he
feel?—and
Rufus
,
whose
prophetic
words
were
sounding
like
a
death
-
knell
in
her
ear
?
<EOS>
She
might
in
truth
never
see
him
again
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Alas
—
alas
—
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
as
one
by
one
such
thoughts
as
these
came
rushing
through
her
brain
,
she
felt
her
head
throb
and
ache
,
and
deemed
but
little
more
would
drive
her
mad
.
<EOS>
Thus
passed
one
of
the
longest
days
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Towards
night
Hetty
placed
some
refreshments
on
the
table
,
which
she
had
found
in
a
basket
;
but
Emily
refused
to
eat
,
and
early
retired
to
her
rude
bed
,
only
to
pass
a
horrible
night
of
feverish
anxiety
,
and
to
dream
,
whenever
she
slept
,
strange
fantastic
dreams
,
that
awoke
her
with
a
shuddering
start
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
she
arose
with
red
,
swollen
eyes
,
and
a
pale
,
sickly
look
.
<EOS>
She
endeavored
to
eat
a
little
to
support
nature
,
for
she
felt
herself
growing
weak
,
but
her
stomach
refused
food
;
and
faint
,
and
exhausted
,
she
retired
again
to
her
pallet
of
straw
.
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
Hetty
glanced
at
her
with
an
uneasy
,
anxious
look
,
but
still
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
As
the
day
wore
on
,
Emily
began
to
feel
more
and
more
the
horrors
of
her
situation
—
her
brain
was
pressed
to
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
her
fate
?
<EOS>
This
silent
suspense
was
terrible
—
terrible
!
<EOS>
It
was
taking
away
her
reason!—and
<EOS>
she
felt
that
any
fate
,
even
death
itself
,
would
be
preferable
to
this
brain
-
wrought
torture
.
<EOS>
Noon
came
,
but
brought
no
relief
;
and
as
the
afternoon
waned
away
,
Emily
felt
she
was
growing
mad
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
started
up
and
listened
.
<EOS>
She
fancied
she
heard
a
distant
footfall
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
of
anxiety
confirmed
it
,
and
she
could
hear
distinctly
the
tramp
of
a
horse
.
<EOS>
Then
it
paused
,
and
Emily
's
heart
beat
fast
.
<EOS>
Presently
she
heard
a
rustling
of
the
bushes
.
<EOS>
The
sound
came
nearer
and
nearer
.
<EOS>
—
It
was
a
joyful
sound
,
let
what
would
follow
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
relief
from
that
dull
,
death
-
like
weariness
of
suspense
.
<EOS>
Nearer
and
nearer
<EOS>
it
came
,
till
at
length
the
tall
,
dark
figure
of
John
Webber
filled
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
Emily
sunk
back
upon
her
pallet
with
strange
,
deep
feelings
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
one
she
wished
,
yet
dreaded
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
might
relieve
her
from
suspense
,
only
to
plunge
her
into
more
fearful
reality
.
<EOS>
Without
ceremony
,
without
even
noticing
Hetty
,
John
strode
directly
towards
Emily
,
and
when
within
a
few
feet
of
her
paused
.
<EOS>
—
As
he
caught
a
full
view
of
her
features
,
there
was
a
slight
start
of
surprise
apparent
in
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
could
scarcely
credit
so
great
a
change
,
in
so
short
a
time
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Emily
,
and
so
we
meet
here
!
<EOS>
"
were
the
first
words
he
uttered
,
in
a
tone
somewhat
stern
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
John
<EOS>
,
"
said
Emily
,
casting
upon
him
a
look
of
imploring
anguish
,
that
would
have
moved
to
tears
of
pity
any
heart
less
hard
than
his
:
—
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
John
,
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
—
to
take
me
,
who
have
been
reared
in
your
father
's
family
,
taught
to
look
upon
you
as
a
brother
,
and
treat
you
at
all
times
as
a
friend
<EOS>
—
how
could
you
take
me
away
from
home
,
and
all
I
love
,
by
the
hands
of
ruffians
,
and
bring
me
to
this
wild
,
uninhabited
region
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
have
I
ever
done
,
that
I
should
receive
such
treatment
at
your
hands?""Refused
me
!
"
<EOS>
replied
John
,
contracting
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"Refused
<EOS>
you
,
because
I
did
not
,
could
not
love
you
,
"
returned
Emily
,
"
and
because
I
would
not
perjure
myself
before
God
and
man
,
by
accepting
your
hand
,
and
swearing
to
love
and
cherish
you
.
<EOS>
But
is
this
to
excuse
you
before
high
Heaven
for
an
act
<EOS>
so
base?""I
seek
no
excuse
for
my
acts
!
<EOS>
"
answered
John
,
smiling
with
one
of
his
devilish
smiles
.
<EOS>
"
Rail
on
,
Emily
—
rail
on!—but
when
you
have
done
,
please
inform
me
why
you
think
you
were
brought
hither
by
my
commands
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
turned
his
dark
eye
upon
Hetty
,
who
trembled
and
grew
pale
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
myself
heard
you
giving
directions
,
at
the
place
where
my
captors
first
paused
,
"
replied
Emily
,
noticing
his
glance
and
the
agitation
of
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"
Blame
her
not
for
this
—
for
if
your
commands
to
her
were
silence
,
I
can
answer
that
you
have
been
strictly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Since
yesterday
morning
,
not
three
words
has
she
spoken
;
and
to
all
my
entreaties
to
the
contrary
has
turned
a
deaf
ear
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
well
,
"
said
John
,
"
that
she
has
not
forgotten
her
duty
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
seems
you
recognised
my
voice
.
<EOS>
Well
,
since
you
know
all
,
perhaps
'
tis
better
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
disguise
that
it
is
by
my
will
and
acts
you
are
here
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
when
you
departed
with
that
fellow
Merton
,
and
I
judged
by
the
course
you
took
where
you
might
be
found
.
<EOS>
I
knew
,
too
,
where
were
some
bold
spirits
,
who
would
not
fail
to
obey
my
commands
,
even
were
those
commands
to
murder
;
and
I
immediately
informed
them
of
your
whereabouts
,
and
what
they
must
perform
for
me
.
<EOS>
Their
task
has
been
well
executed
,
for
you
are
here
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
—
What
you
are
here
for
,
I
presume
you
know
;
but
lest
you
should
feign
ignorance
,
I
will
inform
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
remember
an
interview
we
had
a
short
time
since
,
during
which
I
offered
,
and
you
refused
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
then
swore
you
should
be
mine
,
and
you
are
here
to
fulfil
that
oath
.
<EOS>
The
matter
you
perceive
is
simple
,
and
easily
understood
.
<EOS>
""But
,
John
,
I
told
you
then
I
could
not
love
you!""And
<EOS>
I
told
you
then
,
Emily
,
it
mattered
not
.
<EOS>
Love
—
pshaw!—what
is
it
?
<EOS>
A
mere
fancy
of
a
brain
disordered
,
or
intoxicated
—
<EOS>
whichever
you
like
--
by
the
silly
romance
of
youth
,
ere
the
mind
has
fully
settled
upon
the
realities
of
life
.
<EOS>
A
strange
something
that
afflicts
some
people
in
the
head
,
as
the
nightmare
does
others
in
the
body
.
<EOS>
Thank
Heaven
,
I
was
never
troubled
with
either
complaint!""Even
were
I
to
set
love
aside
,
I
could
not
be
yours
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Emily
.
<EOS>
"Wherefore?""My
<EOS>
hand
is
pledged
to
another
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
is
it
so
?
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
you
must
break
that
pledge
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
surely
,
John
,
there
must
be
some
pity
in
your
heart
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
not
--
do
not
drive
me
to
hate
one
I
have
ever
been
taught
to
look
upon
as
a
brother
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
beg
of
you
,
release
me
—
return
me
to
my
home
,
and
I
will
bless
you
!
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
a
child
of
passion
,
and
one
who
in
moments
of
excitement
would
be
likely
to
err
;
but
oh
!
bring
calm
reflection
to
your
aid
,
and
retrieve
ere
too
late
the
wrong
you
have
done
me
!
<EOS>
Do
this
,
John
,
do
this
,
and
you
shall
never
have
cause
to
repent
it
!
<EOS>
I
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
make
you
happy
;
and
I
solemnly
swear
to
you
,
from
my
lips
shall
never
pass
an
accusation
or
reproach
!
<EOS>
I
will
strictly
conceal
,
as
I
have
concealed
your
threat
,
that
aught
of
anything
<EOS>
but
kind
regards
ever
passed
between
us
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
will
you
not
do
this
,
and
make
me
happy
,
and
others
,
and
yourself
happy
also?""On
<EOS>
one
condition
,
Emily
,
I
will
release
you
.
<EOS>
""Name
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
,
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
you
will
swear
to
be
mine
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
""Oh
<EOS>
,
you
know
I
can
not
do
this
,
John
,
<EOS>
so
wherefore
urge
me?""I
know
you
must
do
this
,
or
worse
!
"
<EOS>
returned
John
,
with
a
dark
look
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
no
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
;
"
you
can
not
,
can
not
be
so
cruel

<EOS>
John!""I
see
you
do
not
know
me
!
"
said
John
,
with
another
devilish
smile
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
what
motive
can
induce
you
to
destroy
the
happiness
of
a
poor
,
nameless
,
I
might
add
,
homeless
girl
,
who
never
did
you
wrong
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
you
cannot
<EOS>
—
I
will
believe
you
can
not
be
so
cruel!""I
<EOS>
see
you
do
not
know
me
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
John
;
"
no
—
nor
even
know
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
are
a
nameless
girl
—
<EOS>
but
therein
you
err
.
<EOS>
Listen
!
<EOS>
Six
months
ago
,
when
you
came
on
from
New
York
,
I
was
struck
with
your
appearance
;
and
thinking
much
on
you
,
your
kindness
to
me
in
days
gone
by
,
and
your
affability
then
<EOS>
,
I
felt
for
you
what
some
enthusiastic
youth
would
probably
term
love
;
but
which
I
,
in
a
more
matter
of
fact
way
,
simply
termed
a
fancy
,
or
an
attachment
.
<EOS>
Thinking
much
on
this
,
I
finally
resolved
you
should
be
mine
at
a
no
distant
day
.
<EOS>
A
resolve
with
me
is
but
the
precursor
of
a
result
—
as
I
do
not
like
to
break
one
,
for
fear
of
setting
myself
a
bad
example
.
<EOS>
Well
,
to
cut
matters
short
,
I
saw
you
a
few
days
since
—
alone
—
told
you
of
my
intention
,
and
you
refused
me
.
<EOS>
That
,
even
that
of
itself
,
Emily
,
had
been
enough
to
tempt
me
to
almost
any
extreme
,
rather
than
fail
in
my
design
—
but
to
that
was
shortly
added
another
and
more
important
inducement
.
<EOS>
You
of
course
remember
the
conversation
in
my
father
's
house
on
the
evening
of
that
day
.
<EOS>
You
will
remember
,
too
,
it
was
then
suggested
that
the
Jew
might
have
in
his
possession
proofs
of
your
parentage
.
<EOS>
The
suggestion
seemed
to
me
a
good
one
,
as
I
had
other
reasons
for
thinking
the
same
.
<EOS>
Well
,
on
that
same
night
—
while
you
were
probably
sleeping
and
dreaming
of
love
,
or
some
other
foolish
thing
--
I
saw
the
Jew
and
obtained
those
proofs
.
<EOS>
""Ah
,
then
he
had
proofs
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
,
suddenly
,
a
gleam
of
joy
passing
over
her
pale
,
careworn
features
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
he
had
proofs
,
"
answered
John
,
"
which
proofs
are
now
in
my
possession
,
and
<EOS>
I
trust
are
sufficient
to
establish
you
an
heiress
of
noble
birth
.
<EOS>
""O
joy
—
joy
!
"
exclaimed
Emily
,
with
a
radiant
smile
upon
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
then
I
am
not
of
mean
parentage
.
<EOS>
O
,
have
you
the
papers
with
you?""They
are
here
;
"
and
John
placed
his
hand
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"O
,
let
me
behold
them
,
and
learn
who
I
<EOS>
am!""On
<EOS>
the
one
condition
you
shall
have
the
full
benefit
of
them
—
without
complying
with
that
,
you
shall
never
see
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
in
your
power
to
choose
,
wealth
and
a
name
,
or
poverty
and
disgrace
.
<EOS>
If
you
accept
my
hand
,
you
shall
be
rich
—
refuse
,
and
you
shall
see
of
what
deeds
I
am
capable
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
your
decision
now
—
you
shall
have
a
few
hours
to
deliberate
.
<EOS>
I
have
business
which
calls
me
away
;
but
ere
to
-
morrow
's
dawn
I
shall
be
here
again
,
and
then
you
must
decide
!
<EOS>
Ponder
well
upon
it
,
girl
,
and
do
not
force
me
to
extremes
!
<EOS>
Remember
you
are
here
,
in
my
power
,
and
beyond
the
reach
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
If
you
decide
to
accept
my
hand
,
all
shall
be
well
;
but
if
you
persist
in
your
obstinacy
,
then
know
,
girl"--and
<EOS>
his
dark
eyes
fastened
upon
her
gleamed
strangely—"then
know
,
girl
,
there
is
a
way
to
make
even
one
as
proud
and
high
-
born
as
you
,
glad
to
accept
the
hand
even
of
a
man
as
base
and
low
-
born
as
I.
<EOS>
I
pray
you
drive
me
not
to
extremes
!
<EOS>
Mine
you
must
be
,
by
fair
means
or
foul!""Oh
,
God
!
"
groaned
Emily
,
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
,
while
a
cold
shudder
passed
over
her
.
"Remember
<EOS>
your
decision
!
"
<EOS>
and
John
turned
upon
his
heel
to
depart
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
his
eye
fell
upon
Hetty
,
and
with
a
start
he
advanced
rapidly
to
her
,
caught
her
by
the
wrist
,
while
she
trembled
and
grew
white
with
fear
.
<EOS>
"You
have
heard
what
you
should
not
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
low
,
hurried
tone
,
his
eyes
glaring
upon
her
with
an
awful
expression
.
<EOS>
"
My
secret
is
in
your
possession
.
<EOS>
Secrets
of
desperate
men
are
sometimes
dangerous
.
<EOS>
Beware
—
beware
!
<EOS>
Breathe
but
a
word
,
be
it
never
so
light
,
of
what
you
have
here
seen
and
heard
,
or
shall
see
and
hear
henceforth
,
and
this
bright
steel
(
partly
drawing
a
dagger
)
<EOS>
shall
revel
in
your
heart
's
blood
!
<EOS>
Remember
—
remember
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
this
he
strode
to
the
door
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
Hetty
remained
in
the
position
he
had
left
her
,
pale
and
trembling
;
and
then
proceeding
to
the
door
herself
,
she
gazed
down
the
hill
,
and
saw
him
mount
his
horse
and
ride
away
,
with
feelings
that
boded
him
no
good
.
<EOS>
When
fully
assured
he
was
gone
,
she
glanced
cautiously
around,—as
if
to
be
certain
no
person
was
lurking
about
the
premises
—
and
then
closing
the
door
,
with
a
trembling
step
she
hurriedly
returned
to
Emily
,
whom
she
found
sobbing
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"Lady
,
"
said
she
,
touching
her
on
the
arm
,
casting
upon
her
a
wild
glance
,
and
speaking
in
a
quick
,
fearful
tone
,
scarcely
above
her
breath
:
<EOS>
"
Lady
,
we
're
in
danger
,
both
on
us!"Emily
looked
up
with
a
start
.
<EOS>
"We're
<EOS>
in
danger
,
gal
,
"
repeated
Hetty
;
"
for
'
mong
all
the
villains
I
've
ever
known
,
I
've
never
seed
the
like
of
him
as
has
just
left
us!""We
are
indeed
in
danger
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Emily
,
earnestly
,
grasping
Hetty
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
dark
deed
of
which
John
Webber
,
to
gain
his
ends
,
is
incapable
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
,
<EOS>
I
know
it
,
gal
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Hetty
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
watched
him
while
he
were
a
talkin
'
to
you
;
I
've
heard
it
all
—
<EOS>
all
he
's
said
,
and
your
sweet
replies
<EOS>
,
that
moved
me
,
hard
as
I
am
,
to
tears
—
and
<EOS>
I
know
his
heart
's
a
rock
.
<EOS>
Lady
,
for
more'n
sixteen
year
<EOS>
I
've
been
mixed
with
bad
men
.
<EOS>
My
husband
was
a
robber
himself
,
and
got
shot
in
his
business
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
men
robbed
and
murdered
without
crying
a
bit
;
but
looking
on
you
,
somehow
's
made
me
a
child
agin
,
and
made
me
think
on
my
innocent
days
—
for
once
,
gal
,
I
were
as
innocent
as
you
be
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
lady
,
believe
me
,
I
pities
<EOS>
you!""Oh
then
,
dear
,
kind
Hetty
,
assist
me
to
escape
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Emily
,
springing
from
her
pallet
—
where
during
her
interview
with
John
she
had
remained
—
and
kneeling
at
the
other
's
feet
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
assist
me
to
escape
,
and
you
shall
be
rewarded
—
richly
rewarded
!
<EOS>
You
will
by
so
doing
save
me
from
a
fate
worse
than
death
itself
;
and
the
good
God
,
who
sees
all
things
,
will
reward
you
for
<EOS>
it!""My
will
's
good
enough
,
gal
,
but
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
You
're
a
great
many
miles
from
home
,
and
you
could
n't
never
reach
thar
'
without
being
discovered
,
and
then
my
life
would
n't
be
worth
a
button
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
and
is
it
so
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
,
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
come
,
lady
,
do
n't
cry
now
,
do
n't

it
makes
me
feel
bad

<EOS>
Rise

<EOS>
It

I
that
ought
to
be
kneeling
to
you

is
so
good

pure

<EOS>
Rise

I

I
'll
do

me
my

<EOS>
Thar
's
only
one
way
to
save
you

and
that
may
fail

<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
one
way
!
"
cried
Emily
,
starting
to
her
feet
.
"
<EOS>
One
way!—well
,
well!—speak
,
speak!""It
's
<EOS>
dangerous

pre'aps

it
'll
fail

it
's
the
only
one
as
I
thinks
on
now

<EOS>
""Well
,
well
—
speak!—what
is
it?""Did
ye
ever
here
gal"—and
<EOS>
Hetty
glanced
cautiously
around
,
as
if
fearful
of
listeners—"did
ye
ever
hear
o
'
Ronald
Bonardi
,
the
great
bandit
cap'en?""I
have
!

<EOS>
replied
Emily
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
lives
in
this
ere
quarter

<EOS>
""Lives
in
this
quarter

<EOS>
repeated
Emily
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
mean
you
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
Surely
,
Bonardi
and
his
band
are
not
in
this
country
now

<EOS>
You
mean
he
did
live
here?""Hush
,
gal
,
hush
—
not
so
loud
!
"
<EOS>
said
Hetty
,
trembling
with
fear
at
the
course
she
was
taking
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
're
heerd
,
it
's
all
up

me

The
great
cap'en
does
live
here
,

it
's
to
him

'll
have
to
go
to
git
you
rescued

<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Emily
,
with
a
start
.
"
<EOS>
Hetty
,
you
must
be
insane
!
<EOS>
Rescue
me
by
appealing
to
that
terrible
man?""It

the
only

returned
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
your
only
chance

so
terrible
towards

I
knows

"It

the
conclusion

was
whispered
in

Emily
,
pausing
thoughtfully

cried
Emily

throwing
up

starting
back

gazing
upon

in
astonishment

said
Emily
,
fervently
;

as
Hetty
disappeared
,
she
bent
her
knees
in
a
prayer
of
supplication
to
Him
who
holds
the

CHAPTER
IV.THE
BANDIT
AND
HIS
WIFE
—
THE
MEETING
OF
THE
BANDITTI
—
THE
TRIAL
—
THE
SENTENCE
—
<EOS>
THE
EXECUTION
—
THE
SECRET
DESIGN
—
THE
EXTRA
SIGNAL.On
the
same
day
of
the
events
immediately
preceding
,
and
at
the
hour
of
twilight
,
Ronald
Bonardi
was
seated
by
the
richly
carved
table
in
the
gorgeous
apartment
known
as
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
uncovered
,
and
his
long
,
black
,
curling
hair
,
thrown
back
from
his
high
,
broad
,
pale
forehead
,
in
rough
disorder
,
seemed
indicative
of
a
mind
disturbed
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
This
was
signally
apparent
in
his
features
.
<EOS>
His
brows
were
knit
together
,
and
there
was
a
combination
of
the
sad
and
sullen
in
his
eyes
,
as
though
by
one
thing
he
was
grieved
,
and
by
another
roused
to
a
severe
,
unshaken
determination
,
the
terminus
of
which
would
be
far
from
pleasant
.
<EOS>
There
was
great
severity
also
exhibited
around
his
mouth
,
the
lips
of
which
were
compressed
and
drawn
slightly
apart
,
leaving
visible
a
small
portion
of
his
front
teeth
.
<EOS>
He
was
seated
,
as
we
have
said
,
by
the
table
,
and
his
eyes
were
resting
with
the
expression
we
have
described
,
upon
some
two
or
three
letters
which
were
lying
open
thereon
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
distance
in
front
,
on
a
sofa
,
sat
his
wife
,
the
beautiful
Inez
,
<EOS>
her
large
dark
eyes
fastened
tenderly
upon
him
,
with
a
look
of
sorrow
,
while
the
smile
we
have
previously
described
around
her
mouth
,
was
mournful
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
pale
,
exhibiting
tokens
of
much
anxiety
,
and
one
would
easily
be
led
to
fancy
she
had
been
weeping
.
<EOS>
Behind
Inez
stood
the
slave
Cyntha
,
gazing
also
upon
the
bandit
captain
,
with
an
expression
little
less
sad
than
that
of
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
For
some
five
minutes
Bonardi
sat
in
the
same
position
,
during
which
time
not
a
muscle
of
his
features
changed
,
as
though
made
fast
by
the
spell
of
some
deep
revery
,
while
the
other
two
,
immoveable
as
himself
,
gazed
on
in
silence
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
started
,
and
with
a
deep
drawn
sigh
relaxed
his
rigidity
of
expression
,
and
his
eyes
wandered
to
those
of
Inez
with
a
softer
glance
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
Inez
notice
the
change
,
than
with
an
airy
bound
<EOS>
she
sprang
forward
,
threw
her
soft
arms
around
his
neck
,
buried
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
,
while
her
dark
curls
mingled
playfully
with
his
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
Inez
,
my
own
dear
Inez
,
"
said
Ronald
,
in
a
low
,
tender
voice
,
far
sweeter
to
her
ear
than
the
softest
notes
of
music
,
"
my
own
dear
Inez
,
you
at
least
are
true
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
threw
one
arm
around
her
waist
,
drew
her
fondly
to
him
,
and
,
as
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
him
,
now
moist
with
tears
,
pressed
a
kiss
of
love
upon
her
rosy
lips
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
own
dear
Inez
,
you
at
least
are
true!""True
,
Ronald
,
"
murmured
Inez
,
"
ay
,
true
,
true
,
forever
,
ever
true
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
bowed
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
wept
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
do
you
say
thus
,
dear
Ronald
,
and
why
do
you
look
so
grieved
and
angered
to
-
day
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
she
at
length
,
looking
up
with
a
sigh
.
"
<EOS>
Are
not
all
true
,
dear
Ronald?""No
,
dearest
,
"
replied
he
,
compressing
his
lips
,
"
all
are
not
true
:
I
would
to
Heaven
they
were
!
<EOS>
But
they
at
least
shall
find
me
true
to
what
I
have
sworn
.
<EOS>
""There
is
trouble
then
,
dear
Ronald
,
and
danger
perhaps
,
"
said
Inez
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
trouble
,
Inez
,
much
trouble
;
but
I
apprehend
no
danger
as
yet
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
treacherous
spirits
to
deal
with
,
and
then
I
trust
all
will
be
well
.
<EOS>
My
letters
from
abroad
bring
me
bad
news
.
<EOS>
Three
of
my
best
men
,
whom
I
sent
forth
as
spies
,
are
dead
,
through
their
own
imprudence
.
<EOS>
One
shot
in
a
street
fight
in
Cincinnati
;
one
killed
in
a
duel
in
New
Orleans
;
and
the
third
,
in
New
York
,
for
shooting
a
man
on
a
slight
provocation
,
has
been
tried
and
executed
.
<EOS>
This
is
sad
news
to
receive
by
one
post
,
for
they
were
all
tried
men
and
true
.
<EOS>
Each
had
in
his
possession
private
papers
of
great
moment
,
from
two
of
whom
they
were
recovered
by
their
comrades
,
immediately
after
their
death
;
but
with
regard
to
the
third
,
the
one
executed
in
New
York
,
it
has
not
turned
out
so
well
—
his
papers
having
been
seized
upon
by
the
authorities
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
fears
how
it
may
terminate
;
for
in
those
so
lost
,
was
a
secret
plan
of
extending
our
band
in
that
quarter
;
in
fact
,
of
establishing
a
league
,
the
head
quarters
of
which
should
be
here
,
throughout
different
sections
of
the
United
States
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
secret
correspondence
was
written
in
an
invisible
ink
,
which
will
only
show
when
the
paper
is
heated
,
while
in
ordinary
ink
was
written
something
entirely
foreign
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
probable
they
will
warm
the
papers
—
if
not
,
<EOS>
all
is
safe
;
and
even
should
they
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
the
contents
,
by
reason
of
the
characters
introduced
,
will
prevent
them
from
making
any
thing
of
them
that
will
lead
to
our
detection
:
still
I
would
they
had
them
not
.
<EOS>
In
the
neighborhood
of
Cincinnati
we
have
already
found
a
few
bold
hearts
who
are
ready
and
willing
to
join
us
.
<EOS>
But
enough
of
this
,
dear
Inez
,
for
it
is
matter
that
scarcely
concerns
,
and
of
course
can
not
interest
you
.
<EOS>
""Any
<EOS>
thing
that
concerns
or
interests
you
,
<EOS>
dear
Ronald
,
I
always
listen
to
with
delight
,
"
said
Inez
,
sweetly
.
<EOS>
"Ah
<EOS>
,
what
would
life
be
without
you
,
sweet
one
;
"
and
again
Ronald
,
bending
down
,
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Inez
,
I
must
no
longer
here
,
for
I
have
deep
matters
on
my
hands
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
our
band
meets
on
a
special
purpose
,
and
already
I
hear
them
assembling
in
the
Outer
Cave
.
<EOS>
There
,
there
,
dear
Inez
,
I
must
go
;
"
and
pressing
his
lips
again
to
hers
,
he
arose
and
gathered
up
the
letters
on
the
table
.
"
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
Cyntha
,
"
continued
he
,
turning
to
the
slave
,
"
bring
wine
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
the
latter
obeyed
,
he
took
the
cup
from
her
hand
and
drained
it
.
"
<EOS>
Again
!
"
he
added
,
reaching
it
forth
.
<EOS>
Again
it
was
filled
,
and
again
he
emptied
it
.
<EOS>
"
Once
more
,
Cyntha
,
"
said
he
,
with
a
wild
light
in
his
eyes
;
"
once
more
!
"
<EOS>
The
slave
obeyed
,
and
the
third
cup
was
drained
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
Ronald
,
dear
Ronald
,
what
means
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Inez
,
who
had
been
gazing
upon
him
with
a
look
of
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
yourself
,
dear
Ronald
!
<EOS>
Something
terrible
is
going
to
take
place
!
<EOS>
You
,
who
seldom
taste
liquor
,
have
drank
three
cups
,
and
there
is
an
awful
look
in
your
eye
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
Ronald
,
tell
me
,
tell
me
what
is
about
to
happen
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
,
as
though
to
detain
him
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
"
said
he
,
gently
disengaging
himself
,
"
there
are
things
,
dear
Inez
,
of
which
one
like
you
should
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
Question
not
,
but
remember
you
are
a
bandit
's
wife!""But
one
who
loves
him
to
whom
she
pledged
her
hand
no
less
for
that
,
"
returned
Inez
,
sweetly
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
are
about
to
encounter
danger
,
dear
Ronald
,
and
if
—
and
if
—
"
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
interrupted
he
,
"
fear
not
.
<EOS>
I
apprehend
no
danger
.
<EOS>
But
hark
!
<EOS>
there
is
the
signal
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
detained
no
longer
;
"
and
turning
hastily
away
,
without
further
ceremony
,
he
drew
aside
the
crimson
curtains
concealing
the
passage
,
and
entered
the
Outer
Cave
,
while
Inez
,
with
a
sad
expression
,
gazed
long
upon
the
spot
where
she
had
seen
him
disappear
.
<EOS>
As
Ronald
had
said
,
a
special
meeting
of
the
band
had
been
called
for
this
evening
,
and
already
a
large
number
had
assembled
when
he
appeared
among
them
,
with
an
expression
on
his
features
but
few
had
ever
seen
before
.
<EOS>
With
a
quick
,
firm
step
he
mounted
the
stand
,
where
the
lieutenant
already
was
before
him
.
"Has
<EOS>
the
roll
been
called
?
"
demanded
he
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"It
has
not
,
captain
,
"
answered
Piketon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
time
set
for
the
meeting
has
not
yet
expired
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
may
as
well
call
it
,
however
,
for
I
see
most
of
our
band
are
here
;
and
should
the
others
arrive
in
due
time
,
they
shall
be
exempted
from
disobedience
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
proceeded
to
obey
his
command
,
Bonardi
stepped
down
and
closed
the
door
of
the
Inner
Cave
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
massive
stone
,
some
ten
inches
in
thickness
,
and
swung
on
heavy
iron
hinges
.
<EOS>
Many
an
eye
of
that
reckless
band
of
outlaws
,
was
fastened
with
an
enquiring
look
upon
their
leader
as
he
did
this
,
for
it
was
a
something
done
only
on
rare
occasions
,
and
when
matters
were
of
a
too
private
nature
for
the
ears
of
women
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
me
the
roll
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bonardi
,
as
the
lieutenant
concluded
the
call
;
and
taking
it
in
his
hand
,
his
eye
ran
over
it
hastily
,
but
with
a
keen
,
sure
glance
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
all
here
,
"
he
continued
in
a
low
tone
to
Piketon
,
"
that
I
expected
,
with
the
exception
of
Saxton
,
Curdish
and
Niles
.
<EOS>
You
will
proceed
,
as
soon
as
circumstances
will
admit
,
to
find
and
order
them
under
arrest
,
to
meet
here
;
and
,
mark
you
!
<EOS>
put
spies
upon
them
,
that
they
may
not
escape
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
doubts
of
their
fidelity
;
but
not
a
word
of
this
to
any
one
—
you
understand?"Piketon
bowed
.
<EOS>
"Gentlemen
,
"
said
Bonardi
,
in
a
louder
tone
,
addressing
the
assemblage
,
"
you
are
here
met
for
a
special
purpose
,
as
of
course
you
are
aware
,
being
notified
out
of
your
regular
time
.
<EOS>
For
your
promptness
in
responding
to
the
call
,
I
thank
you
!
<EOS>
and
by
it
feel
assured
that
though
I
may
govern
some
traitors
,
most
of
my
band
are
true
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
surprise
on
your
countenances
,
by
which
I
know
that
most
of
you
do
not
understand
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
detain
you
with
any
long
explanation
,
but
rather
let
actions
speak
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
gentlemen
,
you
are
here
met
to
witness
the
trial
of
a
traitor!"At
the
last
words
,
a
sudden
start
was
visible
with
most
of
the
party
present
,
while
with
some
few
it
was
accompanied
with
a
slight
paleness
.
<EOS>
—
Bonardi
noticed
all
,
with
a
quick
,
searching
glance
,
and
turning
to
Piketon
,
added
:
"
Bring
up
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"Raising
<EOS>
a
trap
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
platform
—
which
by
the
way
was
some
fifteen
feet
in
length
<EOS>
—
Piketon
immediately
disappeared
,
while
every
eye
was
bent
in
that
direction
,
with
a
look
of
anxious
wonder
,
to
learn
who
was
the
one
suspected
of
a
crime
in
their
eyes
so
degrading
,
and
which
,
if
followed
by
conviction
,
must
end
in
a
manner
the
most
tragical
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
long
kept
in
suspense
,
for
Piketon
shortly
reappeared
;
and
low
curses
,
deep
imprecations
,
horrible
oaths
,
and
fierce
,
angry
gestures
succeeded
,
as
they
recognised
in
his
companion
,
<EOS>
the
ugly
,
quivering
,
coward'y
features
,
and
the
stooped
,
aged
,
trembling
form
of
David
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
As
Piketon
led
him
forward
in
front
of
the
stand
,
his
small
black
eyes
turned
with
a
rapid
,
sickly
glance
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
party
;
but
he
saw
nothing
,
save
such
dark
,
stern
,
angry
looks
,
as
made
his
very
heart
shrink
within
him
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
good
shentlemens
—
"
"
Silence
,
Jew
!
"
interrupted
Bonardi
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
here
to
speak
only
when
called
upon!""Oh
,
good
Mistoor
Captains
—
"
"
Silence
,
I
say
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bonardi
,
with
an
angry
gesture
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
insolence
in
the
face
of
my
commands
is
unbearable
!
<EOS>
Piketon
,
place
a
pistol
to
his
head
;
and
if
he
speak
again
ere
spoken
to
,
send
a
bullet
through
his
brain
!
"
<EOS>
Piketon
instantly
obeyed
,
and
the
Jew
,
knowing
the
command
would
be
promptly
executed
to
the
letter
,
stood
mute
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
remember
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Ronald
,
"
that
when
we
met
here
last
,
one
of
our
party
,
Curdish
—
who
I
am
sorry
to
say
is
now
absent
—
insinuated
in
rather
strong
terms
that
the
Jew
intended
to
betray
us
—
or
to
that
effect
—
but
at
the
same
time
was
not
willing
to
swear
to
it
.
<EOS>
—
You
will
also
recollect
that
I
ordered
him
under
arrest
,
and
told
you
the
matter
should
be
looked
to
.
<EOS>
I
questioned
him
in
private
,
and
learned
enough
to
be
satisfied
that
for
the
present
our
safety
might
depend
upon
having
the
Jew
closely
watched
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
I
wished
also
to
give
the
latter
a
fair
opportunity
to
forego
any
wicked
design
he
might
have
in
contemplation
,
and
to
talk
with
him
on
some
other
matters
,
I
ordered
him
under
arrest
likewise
.
<EOS>
During
my
examination
of
him
,
I
became
more
than
ever
convinced
that
he
was
meditating
treachery
;
and
my
last
words
to
him
were
,
`
go
Jew
,
but
beware
,
for
a
sleepless
eye
will
be
upon
you
!
'
<EOS>
He
made
no
reply
,
but
there
was
in
his
countenance
a
look
of
savage
cunning
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
`
I
shall
outwit
and
betray
you
.
'
<EOS>
So
I
interpreted
it
;
and
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
I
called
one
of
my
sentinels
—
a
man
in
whom
I
had
implicit
confidence
,
both
as
to
being
trusted
,
and
possessing
sufficient
cunning
to
overreach
the
Jew
—
related
the
whole
matter
,
bade
him
dog
his
steps
,
and
take
whatever
measures
he
might
see
proper
to
learn
if
my
suspicious
were
correct
;
and
,
if
so
,
so
soon
as
he
could
gather
proof
sufficient
,
to
bring
him
hither
—
which
latter
you
perceive
,
gentlemen
,
has
been
done
.
<EOS>
Now
for
the
proof
.
<EOS>
Hendrick
,
you
will
stand
forth
,
so
as
to
confront
the
prisoner!"At
the
word
,
a
tall
,
thin
faced
,
intellectual
,
cunning
looking
man
,
with
grey
eyes
,
came
forward
to
the
stand
.
<EOS>
"I
suppose
you
are
aware
,
Hendrick
,
"
continued
the
captain
,
addressing
him
,
"
of
the
penalty
of
giving
false
evidence?""I
am
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Hendrick
,
calmly
.
"Enough
!
<EOS>
Now
let
us
hear
your
testimony
in
regard
to
David
.
<EOS>
""Shall
I
relate
everything
that
occurred
,
captain?""No
,
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
waste
time
.
<EOS>
—
Relate
only
that
which
bears
directly
on
his
treasonable
design
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
then
,
"
began
Hendrick
,
"
after
following
the
Jew
through
all
his
crooks
and
turns
,
until
he
reached
his
place
of
abode
,
on
the
banks
of
the
Mississippi
,
which
he
did
about
dusk
on
the
third
day
from
his
leaving
here
—
having
traveled
the
whole
distance
on
foot
—
<EOS>
I
determined
,
if
possible
,
to
secrete
myself
within
his
hovel
,
where
I
judged
I
should
be
the
better
able
to
learn
of
his
private
intentions
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
his
own
imprudence
favored
me
in
the
first
,
as
his
tongue
afterwards
did
in
the
last
.
<EOS>
By
great
adroitness
I
managed
to
keep
him
within
sight
the
whole
distance
,
and
remain
myself
unseen
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
said
,
he
reached
his
hovel
about
dusk
of
the
third
day
;
and
the
shadows
of
the
coming
night
favoring
me
,
I
was
enabled
to
be
close
upon
him
when
he
entered
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
my
surprise
he
did
not
close
and
bolt
his
door
immediately
,
and
availing
myself
of
this
,
a
moment
or
two
after
<EOS>
,
I
noiselessly
followed
him
across
the
threshold
,
and
found
him
engaged
with
flint
and
steel
in
striking
a
light
.
<EOS>
The
flash
from
the
steel
enabled
me
to
perceive
a
table
,
which
I
succeeded
in
reaching
,
and
concealing
myself
under
,
without
alarming
him
.
<EOS>
After
having
lit
a
candle
,
he
proceeded
to
bolt
his
door
,
and
then
,
as
if
he
felt
himself
entirely
free
from
danger
,
let
off
a
volley
of
curses
and
all
manner
of
imprecations
on
the
banditti
,
its
captain
especially
,
which
he
finished
by
swearing
to
have
revenge
on
the
whole
party
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
for
a
time
,
he
became
more
quiet
,
and
proceeding
to
a
kind
of
closet
,
regaled
himself
with
food
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
seated
himself
by
the
table
,
underneath
which
I
was
lying
,
and
for
some
two
hours
was
silent
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
began
again
,
by
uttering
the
word
revenge
,
and
swearing
he
would
have
it
on
those
who
had
foiled
him
in
a
matter
concerning
some
girl
;
that
to
get
this
revenge
,
he
would
,
on
the
following
day
,
proceed
to
St.
Louis
,
betray
the
band
,
and
secure
the
reward
offered
for
our
captain
's
head
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Hendrick
said
this
,
several
of
the
party
present
,
unable
longer
to
smother
their
wrath
,
burst
into
a
yell
of
rage
,
with
cries
of
,
"
Death
—
death
!
<EOS>
Away
with
him
!
<EOS>
Enough
proof
!
<EOS>
Wretch
!
<EOS>
Villian!"—while
knives
and
pistols
flashed
in
the
light
of
the
torches
,
and
some
few
moved
forward
as
if
to
seize
the
Jew
,
who
,
ghastly
and
breathless
,
was
nearly
fainting
with
terror
.
<EOS>
"Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Bonardi
,
waiving
his
hand
with
dignity
.
"
<EOS>
Justice
shall
be
done
,
gentlemen
,
fear
not
.
"
<EOS>
In
an
instant
that
rough
sea
of
passion
was
calm
as
a
still
lake
,
when
Ronald
again
added
,
"
Go
on
,
Hendrick
,
but
be
brief
as
possible
.
<EOS>
""Railing
in
this
manner
for
awhile
<EOS>
,
"
resumed
Hendrick
,
"
he
finally
touched
upon
his
money
,
some
papers
in
his
possession
,
and
how
best
he
might
dispose
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
papers
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bonardi
,
quickly
,
interrupting
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
well
,
what
of
the
papers?""Why
,
as
I
did
not
understand
the
allusion
,
"
answered
Hendrick
,
"
I
paid
but
<EOS>
little
regard
to
his
remarks
;
though
I
remember
his
muttering
something
about
disposing
of
them
to
some
one
who
loved
the
girl
,
probably
meaning
the
same
one
he
had
alluded
to
before
.
<EOS>
""The
same
,
doubtless
,
but
continue
.
<EOS>
""After
going
on
in
this
manner
sometime
,
he
proceeded
to
the
closet
,
and
brought
forth
a
bag
and
some
papers
.
<EOS>
The
bag
contained
money
,
as
I
could
tell
by
hearing
him
empty
it
on
the
table
;
and
for
a
full
hour
he
amused
himself
,
as
nigh
as
I
could
judge
,
in
counting
and
handling
it
,
and
some
half
hour
more
in
examining
the
papers
,
when
he
returned
them
to
the
closet
.
<EOS>
While
there
,
I
heard
him
mutter
something
about
killing
some
one
;
then
he
came
for
the
light
,
and
seemed
much
agitated
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
he
went
back
,
the
light
disappeared
,
and
curiosity
prompting
me
,
I
crept
forth
to
learn
what
had
become
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
entered
the
closet
carefully
,
and
,
to
my
surprise
,
found
a
trap
-
door
raised
,
leading
down
into
a
vault
,
from
which
issued
a
stench
so
disagreeable
,
that
I
immediately
retired
,
but
not
until
I
had
heard
some
words
passed
with
one
below
,
whom
the
Jew
,
as
I
judged
,
had
gone
down
to
murder
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
<EOS>
!
"
remarked
Ronald
,
with
interest
,
"
here
is
mystery
,
truly
.
<EOS>
I
would
I
had
known
of
this
before
.
<EOS>
Speak
,
Jew
,
who
had
you
there
?
"
<EOS>
But
the
Jew
,
in
his
fright
and
astonishment
at
hearing
all
these
things
,
which
he
believed
known
only
to
himself
,
so
correctly
narrated
,
had
lost
all
power
of
speech
,
and
Ronald
nodded
to
Hendrick
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
it
terminated
below
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
,
"
continued
the
witness
;
"
but
just
at
this
moment
I
was
astonished
by
hearing
the
approach
of
a
horse
,
and
,
following
immediately
,
a
knocking
on
the
door
,
with
a
demand
for
admittance
,
and
I
crept
under
the
table
,
wondering
what
I
was
to
behold
next
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
shortly
appeared
,
evidently
much
alarmed
,
for
he
enquired
in
a
trembling
voice
who
was
there
.
<EOS>
The
answer
was
in
our
phrase
,
`
Ele
lio
.
'
"
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Bonardi
:
"
<EOS>
Well?""The
Jew
,
out
of
fear
,
then
opened
the
door
,
when
a
tall
figure
walked
in
,
and
,
after
some
prevar
ication
,
told
him
(
the
Jew
)
that
he
had
papers
concerning
a
young
girl
,
for
which
he
(
the
stranger
)
had
come
expressly
.
<EOS>
This
the
Jew
stoutly
denied
,
when
the
stranger
took
another
method
,
and
frightened
him
into
owning
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
result
was
that
the
Jew
brought
forward
the
papers
,
and
gave
them
to
the
other
,
who
immediately
departed
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
stranger
?
"
asked
Ronald
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
,
for
his
face
was
concealed
by
a
mask
.
<EOS>
""That
he
is
one
of
our
band
,
is
evident
from
his
reply
to
the
Jew
,
"
said
Ronald
.
<EOS>
"
See
you
in
any
person
present
a
figure
corresponding
with
his?"Hendrick
glanced
slowly
around
upon
the
assemblage
,
who
were
listening
with
breathless
interest
,
until
his
eye
fell
upon
John
Webber
,
where
it
rested
for
a
moment
,
while
the
latter
grew
deadly
pale
.
<EOS>
Hendrick
noticed
this
,
and
replied:"I
see
none
,
captain
,
that
better
corresponds
than
the
person
of
Webber
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
how
is
this
,
sir
?
"
asked
Ronald
,
quickly
,
fastening
his
eyes
keenly
upon
John
,
and
marking
the
change
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
is
this
,
sir?""I
know
nothing
of
it
,
"
replied
John
,
firmly
,
immediately
recovering
himself
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
voice
tallies
well
,
"
remarked
Hendrick
.
<EOS>
"Would
<EOS>
you
insinuate
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
began
John
,
with
a
flashing
eye
,
and
fierce
expression
.
<EOS>
"Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Ronald
,
interrupting
him
;
"
this
is
no
place
to
quarrel
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
know
nothing
of
it
—
so
let
it
pass
.
<EOS>
If
I
find
you
have
deceived
me
,
however,—beware
,
sir
,
beware
!
<EOS>
Hendrick
,
you
will
proceed
with
your
evidence
concerning
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
""After
<EOS>
the
stranger
had
departed
,
"
again
resumed
Hendrick
,
"
the
Jew
seemed
beside
himself
with
rage
;
and
instead
of
waiting
for
the
morrow
,
as
was
his
first
intention
,
he
swore
he
would
instantly
set
off
for
St.
Louis
,
betray
the
band
,
and
at
once
seek
security
from
the
law
.
<EOS>
With
this
intent
he
started
,
and
with
a
very
different
one
I
followed
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
reached
some
half
way
,
I
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
told
him
I
arrested
him
in
the
name
of
Ronald
Bonardi
.
<EOS>
He
trembled
violently
,
and
offered
me
his
bag
of
gold
to
let
him
go
.
<EOS>
I
answered
I
was
not
to
be
bought
,
and
brought
him
hither
.
<EOS>
Thus
ends
my
testimony
,
which
,
according
to
our
laws
,
I
affirm
before
God
and
man
is
true
,
and
stake
my
life
upon
the
oath!""You
have
done
well
,
Hendrick
,
"
said
Ronald
,
as
the
other
concluded
,
"
and
deserve
great
praise
,
with
a
suitable
reward
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
praise
is
sufficient
,
noble
captain
,
"
returned
Hendrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
reward
I
wish
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
but
my
duty
.
<EOS>
""Nevertheless
you
shall
not
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Promptly
to
reward
,
as
promptly
to
punish
,
shall
henceforth
be
the
justice
motto
of
Ronald
Bonardi
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
you
have
heard
the
testimony
against
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
one
or
more
among
you
,
who
doubts
the
evidence
just
given
,
or
who
believes
the
Jew
guiltless
of
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged
—
namely
,
intentional
perjury
,
and
treason
against
us
as
a
body
—
he
or
they
will
now
come
forward
and
make
known
the
same
.
<EOS>
"Silence
<EOS>
reigned
throughout
the
cave
.
<EOS>
Not
a
man
moved
.
<EOS>
"Jew
,
"
continued
Bonardi
,
solemnly
,
with
compressed
lips
,
"
before
this
body
,
in
the
hearts
of
each
<EOS>
,
you
stand
condemned
as
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
When
you
joined
us
,
you
took
a
solemn
oath
,
which
in
your
heart
you
have
broken
,
as
you
would
have
broken
by
your
deeds
,
had
not
our
interference
prevented
.
<EOS>
Your
minutes
are
numbered
.
<EOS>
You
are
an
old
,
grey
-
headed
,
grey
-
bearded
man
,
and
your
soul
is
black
with
crimes
,
which
,
if
not
repented
of
now
,
will
go
with
you
to
another
world
.
<EOS>
You
present
a
spectacle
at
once
pitiable
and
revolting
;
and
base
as
you
are
,
I
can
not
but
regret
that
it
falls
to
my
lot
to
fulfil
the
letter
of
our
law
,
and
make
you
an
example
to
others
;
but
I
have
sworn
to
do
my
duty
faithfully
;
and
were
you
my
own
brother
,
my
bosom
friend
,
I
would
keep
my
oath
.
<EOS>
Although
appearances
were
much
against
you
when
here
before
,
I
deemed
it
my
duty
to
warn
you
,
so
that
if
in
reality
you
meditated
treachery
,
you
might
have
a
chance
to
repent
of
your
base
design
in
season
.
<EOS>
You
heeded
not
my
warning
,
and
now
with
you
rest
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
Your
sentence
is
death
!
<EOS>
Have
you
any
request
to
make
ere
the
fatal
moment
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
speak
!
<EOS>
we
listen
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
oh
!
mine
Gott
!
mercys
—
mercys
!
<EOS>
"
gasped
the
Jew
,
sinking
upon
his
knees
.
<EOS>
"Coward
!
"
cried
Ronald
,
fiercely
;
"
base
,
paltry
coward!—you
were
unworthyto
belong
to
us
!
<EOS>
I
'll
hear
no
more
!
<EOS>
Piketon
,
you
will
put
a
bandage
around
his
eyes
,
and
lead
him
forward
.
<EOS>
If
he
attempt
to
cry
out
,
gag
him
!
"
<EOS>
But
this
latter
injunction
was
unnecessary
,
for
the
Jew
in
his
fright
had
actually
fainted
.
<EOS>
Piketon
instantly
passed
a
kerchief
around
the
Jew
's
eyes
;
and
then
,
placing
his
hands
under
his
armpits
,
raised
and
drew
him
forward
,
with
his
feet
trailing
on
the
ground
,
to
within
a
short
distance
of
where
paced
the
sentinel
,
while
every
eye
followed
the
movement
,
and
every
heart
felt
a
pressure
of
awe
upon
it
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
they
had
been
a
band
,
an
execution
they
had
never
yet
witnessed
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
only
remains
now
,
"
said
Bonardi
,
in
a
deep
,
solemn
voice
,
"
for
me
to
read
the
law
,
that
I
may
not
be
accused
hereafter
of
acting
illegally
;
"
and
taking
from
a
desk
before
him
a
roll
of
parchment
,
he
opened
it
and
read
as
follows:"Sec

found
guilty

<EOS>
Taking
up
another
roll
<EOS>
he
continued:"Black

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
now
,
gentlemen
,
"
continued
Bonardi
,
laying
down
the
roll
,
"
am
I
not
fully
justified
in
all
that
I
have
done
,
and
am
about
to
do
,
in
executing
yonder
<EOS>
traitor?""You
are
,
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
dozen
voices
.
<EOS>
"Enough!"Drawing
<EOS>
a
pistol
from
his
belt
<EOS>
,
Ronald
descended
from
the
stand
,
and
with
a
firm
step
,
and
compressed
lips
,
walked
forward
to
the
Jew
,
while
each
member
rose
to
his
feet
,
to
look
on
with
an
expression
peculiar
to
himself
.
<EOS>
And
strange
and
varying
were
those
expressions
.
<EOS>
Some
frowned
heavily
;
some
smiled
darkly
;
some
looked
pale
,
and
shut
their
teeth
hard
;
and
some
gazed
on
with
seeming
indifference
.
<EOS>
Bonardi
himself
seemed
composed
and
calm
,
with
a
look
of
unshaken
determination
;
but
there
was
,
notwithstanding
,
a
slight
paleness
in
his
features
,
an
unusual
compression
of
the
lips
,
as
though
requiring
an
effort
to
keep
them
firm
.
<EOS>
As
he
approached
the
Jew
,
who
was
lying
on
the
ground
,
the
latter
appeared
suddenly
to
recover
his
senses
,
and
with
one
hand
raised
himself
into
a
sitting
posture
,
while
with
the
other
he
removed
from
his
eyes
the
bandage
,
and
with
a
horror
stricken
look
glared
round
upon
the
assembly
.
"
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
,
Jew
!
"
said
Ronald
,
as
he
paused
by
his
side
,
while
the
cave
was
as
silent
as
the
chamber
of
death
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
see
once
more
the
faces
of
those
you
would
have
betrayed
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
,
Jew
,
'
tis
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
Look
well
on
each
,
and
bear
the
impression
with
you
to
eternity
,
for
on
earth
you
will
behold
them
no
more
.
<EOS>
Brothers
of
you
they
were
—
who
would
have
risked
life
for
you
,
many
of
them
,
if
necessary
—
but
they
are
your
brothers
no
more
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Jew
turned
his
old
eyes
upon
the
speaker
,
with
a
strange
,
bewildered
expression
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Ronald
ceased
,
and
then
said
solemnly:"Justice
waits
.
<EOS>
Your
time
,
Jew
,
has
come
.
<EOS>
—
Farewell
!
"
<EOS>
Raising
his
pistol
as
he
spoke
,
with
the
last
words
came
a
sharp
report
—
a
shudder
passed
through
the
assembly
—
and
the
Jew
,
with
a
ghastly
contortion
of
visage
,
fell
back
without
a
groan
.
<EOS>
His
soul
was
with
his
God
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
die
all
traitors
!
"
<EOS>
spoke
the
voice
of
Ronald
Bonardi
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
in
a
tone
so
deep
and
solemn
almost
sepulchral
,
that
it
thrilled
the
bosom
of
every
one
present
.
<EOS>
"
Comrades
,
"
and
he
moved
his
eyes
slowly
over
each
,
in
a
most
impressive
manner
,
"
comrades
,
whose
turn
among
you
next
?
'
<EOS>
Tis
the
first
blood
upon
my
hands
;
"
and
he
held
them
forth
,
and
gazed
sadly
upon
them
;
"
whose
blood
is
destined
to
cover
the
foul
stain
?
<EOS>
Be
warned
,
be
warned
in
time
!
"
and
turning
away
,
he
slowly
retraced
his
steps
to
the
farther
end
of
the
cave
,
and
again
mounted
the
stand
.
<EOS>
"
Bear
the
corpse
without
the
cave
until
you
depart
,
"
he
continued
,
"
when
some
of
you
will
take
it
in
a
boat
to
the
Osage
,
row
a
short
distance
up
the
stream
,
and
cast
it
upon
the
bank
,
far
above
high
water
mark
.
<EOS>
So
ends
the
career
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
four
men
laid
hold
of
the
body
and
bore
it
up
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
they
returned
,
when
Bonardi
resumed:"Here
,
"
he
said
,
taking
up
a
well
filled
bag
,
"
is
the
money
which
belonged
to
the
deceased
.
<EOS>
—
This
will
be
divided
among
you
,
when
our
other
business
for
the
evening
is
closed
.
<EOS>
Piketon
will
make
the
division
.
<EOS>
By
our
law
,
I
am
entitled
to
one
-
tenth
.
<EOS>
Hendrick
,
besides
your
share
,
you
will
accept
mine
.
<EOS>
""But
,
captain—""Nay
,
Hendrick
,
no
remark
:
I
would
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
comrades
,
I
have
something
important
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
Listen
!
<EOS>
You
will
remember
that
for
some
time
past
we
have
held
in
contemplation
an
attack
on
a
rich
planter
living
in
Tennessee
.
<EOS>
To
speak
candidly
my
own
mind
,
I
must
say
the
design
never
suited
me
;
and
in
its
place
I
have
one
to
offer
,
which
I
trust
will
meet
your
approbation
.
<EOS>
Some
two
or
three
days
since
,
I
received
a
letter
from
one
of
my
secret
agents
in
New
Orleans
,
which
informs
me
that
of
late
there
has
been
a
great
run
on
the
banks
there
for
specie
;
and
that
to
supply
the
demand
,
they
will
be
forced
to
borrow
,
for
a
time
,
from
neighboring
cities
;
and
that
he
believed
an
order
had
already
been
sent
to
St.
Louis
for
a
large
sum
,
which
doubtless
would
shortly
pass
down
on
one
of
the
steamers
,
and
which
,
should
we
be
fortunate
enough
to
capture
,
would
in
all
probability
make
our
fortunes
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
had
read
this
,
I
set
to
work
to
learn
the
truth
of
it
;
and
as
I
am
well
known
among
the
merchants
and
men
of
wealth
in
St.
Louis
,
as
a
speculator
in
land
,
under
a
different
cognomen
,
I
was
not
long
in
finding
it
fully
corroborated
.
<EOS>
By
dint
of
perseverence
,
I
have
been
enabled
to
learn
that
a
boat
,
which
leaves
within
a
few
days
,
will
carry
this
money
;
of
the
amount
I
am
yet
ignorant
,
though
without
question
the
sum
will
be
large
.
<EOS>
My
plan
is
this
:
I
will
ascertain
to
a
certainty
the
day
of
her
leaving
,
and
also
the
hour
.
<EOS>
I
will
learn
,
too
,
the
speed
of
the
boat
,
and
calculate
the
distance
,
so
that
we
may
find
a
good
point
to
station
ourselves
,
where
the
current
hugs
the
western
shore
,
and
where
she
will
pass
about
dark
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
I
will
procure
several
skiffs
,
and
have
them
floated
down
to
the
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
These
must
be
manned
,
and
lie
concealed
under
cover
of
the
bank
until
the
given
signal
.
<EOS>
As
the
steamer
heaves
in
sight
,
some
two
or
three
of
our
party
must
hail
her
from
the
bank
,
when
she
,
under
the
impression
that
they
wish
to
take
passage
,
will
lay
to
and
send
out
a
boat
.
<EOS>
As
the
latter
touches
the
shore
,
the
oarsman
must
be
seized
,
gagged
and
bound
,
quickly
and
quietly
,
while
some
three
of
our
party
will
instantly
leap
into
the
boat
and
row
back
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
approaching
the
larger
boat
direct
,
they
will
cross
her
bows
,
and
when
on
the
other
side
,
will
seemingly
get
into
a
fight
,
and
discharge
several
pistols
.
<EOS>
This
of
course
will
attract
the
attention
of
all
on
board
the
steamer
,
and
be
the
signal
for
the
concealed
boats
to
shoot
out
and
approach
her
on
the
larboard
side
—
her
head
being
up
stream
—
which
must
be
done
with
lightning
speed
,
but
without
noise
.
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
will
be
commanded
by
Piketon
and
myself
.
<EOS>
The
moment
we
come
along
side
,
some
of
the
boldest
and
most
agile
of
our
party
will
follow
me
in
leaping
on
board
,
where
will
be
found
three
of
our
band
,
who
have
come
down
from
St.
Louis
,
ready
to
show
us
where
the
money
is
stowed
,
and
assist
us
in
getting
it
into
our
boats
.
<EOS>
The
money
will
be
found
in
small
casks
,
which
can
be
easily
handled
,
and
,
to
succeed
,
must
be
handled
expeditiously
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
probable
that
we
can
remove
it
all
;
but
in
the
confusion
that
will
ensue
,
doubtless
enough
to
enrich
us
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
pressed
hard
,
we
must
discharge
some
of
our
pistols
,
not
with
the
intention
of
wounding
,
but
merely
to
frighten
,
and
thicken
the
confusion
,
while
at
the
same
time
we
will
add
the
old
cry
,
which
I
trust
is
not
yet
forgotten
:
`
<EOS>
Yield
to
the
attack
of
Ronald
Bonardi
!
'
<EOS>
We
must
keep
a
plenty
of
undischarged
pistols
by
us
,
however
,
to
be
used
only
in
cases
of
extreme
necessity
,
and
then
not
to
take
life
if
it
can
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
have
accomplished
our
design
,
I
will
give
the
signal
by
a
shrill
whistle
,
when
each
man
must
spring
for
his
boat
,
and
row
as
for
life
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
We
will
then
knock
out
the
heads
of
the
casks
,
empty
the
money
into
bags
,
throw
them
across
our
saddles
,
(
for
our
horses
must
be
in
waiting
,
close
at
hand
)
<EOS>
mount
and
away
,
in
various
directions
,
to
rendezvous
here
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Such
is
my
plan
.
<EOS>
"As
he
concluded
,
the
cave
echoed
with
three
tremendous
cheers
,
and
"
Long
live
Ronald
Bonardi
,
"
when
he
immediately
responded:"I
am
pleased
,
gentlemen
,
to
know
that
my
project
finds
with
you
so
much
favor
;
but
I
will
not
disguise
from
you
,
what
I
can
not
from
myself
,
that
my
plan
may
fail
;
and
at
the
best
,
will
be
attended
with
a
great
deal
of
danger
,
perhaps
loss
of
life
;
and
,
furthermore
,
that
it
will
in
all
probability
rouse
up
the
country
against
us
,
as
was
done
heretofore
.
<EOS>
In
the
latter
case
,
each
must
make
his
way
out
of
it
as
quietly
as
possible
,
and
remain
until
the
storm
has
blown
over
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
And
now
,
a
word
or
two
more
,
and
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
You
will
each
and
all
of
you
hold
yourselves
in
readiness
for
a
moment
's
warning
,
with
horses
well
fed
and
rested
for
a
long
journey
.
<EOS>
When
you
hear
the
signal
of
three
blasts
on
a
bugle
,
be
it
night
or
day
,
you
will
mount
and
ride
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
rendezvous
is
the
hut
of
the
traitor
Jew
,
where
you
will
learn
more
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
so
soon
as
Piketon
has
made
a
division
of
the
money
,
you
will
quietly
disperse
to
your
several
homes
,
and
hold
yourselves
,
as
I
said
before
,
prepared
for
any
event
.
<EOS>
For
your
kind
attention
,
I
thank
you
!
<EOS>
Adieu
.
<EOS>
"Descending
<EOS>
from
the
stand
,
Bonardi
opened
the
stone
door
and
entered
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
,
with
a
clouded
brow
and
heavy
heart
;
for
he
felt
there
was
blood
upon
his
hands
.
<EOS>
An
hour
later
,
he
was
seated
by
the
table
,
on
which
rested
his
arms
,
with
his
head
bowed
upon
them
,
while
Inez
,
standing
by
his
side
,
was
playing
upon
her
guitar
,
and
singing
a
tender
strain
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
raised
his
head
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
"
said
he
;
"
there
is
the
signal
for
me
again
!
<EOS>
What
can
it
mean
at
this
hour
?
"
and
rising
as
he
spoke
,
he
entered
the
larger
cave
,
where
he
found
the
sentinel
alone
,
the
remainder
of
the
party
having
departed
.
<EOS>
"A
woman
awaits
you
in
a
boat
without
,
captain
,
"
said
the
sentinel
,
bowing
respectfully
.
<EOS>
—
"
She
could
not
give
the
pass
and
countersign
,
and
so
I
could
not
admit
her
.
<EOS>
""A
woman
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Ronald
,
in
astonishment
.
"
<EOS>
To
see
me
—
a
woman!—what
wants
she
here
?
"
<EOS>
and
with
a
quick
step
,
he
moved
forward
and
mounted
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
he
returned
,
and
seemed
much
agitated
.
<EOS>
"Inez
,
"
said
he
,
entering
the
Inner
Cave
,
"
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
be
absent
now
.
<EOS>
Ere
morning
I
will
return
;
"
and
without
waiting
a
reply
,
he
seized
upon
a
brace
of
pistols
lying
on
the
ta
ble
and
withdrew
.
"
<EOS>
Did
Piketon
leave
word
where
he
should
rest
to
-
night
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
of
the
sentinel
,
as
he
again
mounted
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
captain
;
he
mentioned
the
Hollow
.
"
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
well
!
"
and
Ronald
disappeared
.

THE
RESULT.Never
had
Emily
experienced
such
loneliness
,
such
utter
desolation
,
as
she
did
after
the
disappearance
of
Hetty
,
as
recorded
in
a
previous
chapter
.
<EOS>
On
her
she
fancied
now
hung
her
destiny
,
life
or
death
.
<EOS>
Would
she
succeed
?
<EOS>
The
very
thought
of
a
failure
made
her
shudder
with
horror
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
lonely
and
desolate
while
Hetty
was
with
her
,
but
now
she
felt
doubly
so
.
<EOS>
Then
at
least
she
was
in
the
presence
of
a
human
being
—
one
of
her
own
sex
—
<EOS>
but
now
she
was
alone,—alone
,
too
,
in
a
wild
,
mountainous
region
;
not
only
far
from
friends
,
but
<EOS>
,
for
aught
she
knew
to
the
contrary
,
far
from
civilization
,
with
a
dark
and
awful
cloud
resting
upon
her
mental
sight
,
and
weighing
down
her
spirits
.
<EOS>
She
threw
herself
upon
her
pallet
and
tried
to
be
composed
;
but
she
only
rolled
to
and
fro
with
the
more
feverish
anxiety
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
hope
for
the
best
,
and
in
her
imagination
draw
bright
pictures
of
the
future
;
but
dark
,
shadowy
forms
,
like
evil
phantoms
,
would
come
between
,
and
the
sunny
spots
go
out
in
gloom
.
<EOS>
Thus
hour
on
hour
went
by
—
each
increasing
,
rather
than
diminishing
,
her
soul
-
torturing
anxiety
—
while
night
crept
gradually
on
,
to
add
its
horrors
,
until
Emily
felt
herself
drawn
to
the
very
verge
of
despair
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
some
two
hours
later
,
she
heard
steps
approaching
;
and
then
she
could
almost
hear
too
the
beatings
of
her
own
heart
,
so
wildly
it
palpitated
.
<EOS>
Were
they
steps
of
friend
or
foe
?
<EOS>
A
few
moments
served
to
decide
;
for
the
voice
of
him
she
feared
-
too
soon
heard
—
was
of
itself
sufficient
to
announce
the
worst
.
<EOS>
John
Webber
had
entered
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
is
this
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
pausing
in
the
doorway
:
"
No
light!—what
means
it?""Hetty
is
not
here
,
"
replied
Emily
,
in
a
faltering
voice
;
"
but
I
am
anxiously
looking
for
her
return
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
has
she
been
long
gone
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
John
,
as
a
suspicion
of
the
cause
of
her
absence
flitted
through
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
has
been
gone
some
minutes
,
"
answered
Emily
,
without
adding
the
whole
truth
,
that
those
minutes
had
already
run
into
hours
;
but
she
knew
,
for
Hetty
's
safety
and
her
own
,
it
was
necessary
to
dissemble
somewhat
—
though
she
would
not
have
been
guilty
of
a
direct
falsehood
,
even
to
have
prevented
the
worst
.
<EOS>
"I
will
teach
her
better
when
she
returns
,
"
said
John
,
angrily
,
proceeding
to
the
table
and
striking
a
light
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
as
well
though
,
perhaps
,
"
he
added
,
a
few
moments
after
,
"
for
our
conversation
will
not
require
the
ears
of
a
third
.
<EOS>
You
remember
,
I
presume
,
the
conditions
imposed
,
when
last
I
quitted
you?""Too
<EOS>
well
I
remember
them
,
"
answered
Emily
,
in
a
trembling
voice
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
have
come
for
my
answer!""But
give
me
more
time
,
John
,
to
deliberate!""Time
!
<EOS>
good
heavens
!
<EOS>
how
much
time
do
you
women
require
to
answer
a
simple
<EOS>
question?""But
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
distracted
since
you
left
,
that
my
mind
could
settle
steadily
upon
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Settle
it
now
,
then
!
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
decide
whether
you
will
be
mine
by
your
own
free
will
or
no
.
<EOS>
Mine
I
have
said
you
must
be!—but
<EOS>
of
course
I
prefer
your
free
consent
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
point
,
Emily
,
I
am
determined
;
and
to
show
you
something
of
the
strength
of
my
determination
,
I
now
swear
to
you
,
that
I
would
sacrifice
every
living
thing
that
should
stand
in
my
way
—
ay
,
even
my
soul
's
salvation
—
rather
than
be
foiled
in
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
Emily
,
I
am
a
desperate
man
,
and
I
beg
of
you
,
for
your
own
sake
,
force
me
not
to
extremes!""I
can
not
answer
you
now
,
John
,
"
said
Emily
,
anxious
to
prolong
the
time
as
much
as
possible
,
in
the
hope
of
receiving
assistance
:
"
Give
me
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
you
will
say
,
give
me
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
returned
John
,
"
and
so
forth
,
and
so
on
,
until
you
by
some
means
effect
your
escape
.
<EOS>
No
,
by
heavens
,
girl
,
this
shall
not
be!—your
answer
must
be
now
!
"
<EOS>
and
John
grasped
her
by
the
arm
,
and
gazed
upon
her
with
a
wicked
look
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
go
your
hold
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
,
her
indignation
fully
aroused
at
this
;
and
springing
from
a
sitting
posture
to
her
feet
,
she
threw
off
his
grasp
.
"
<EOS>
Shame
on
you
!
"
<EOS>
continued
she
,
with
a
flashing
eye
;
"
shame
on
you
,
for
a
villain
and
coward
!
<EOS>
Brave
deeds
these
,
truly
,
for
a
man
of
your
strength
,
to
attack
an
unprotected
female
!
<EOS>
Go
,
get
you
hence
,
and
repent
of
your
acts
!
<EOS>
Go
,
go
,
for
shame
on
you
,
go!""When
you
have
done
,
"
hissed
John
,
through
his
clenched
teeth
,
his
face
livid
with
passion
,
"
when
you
have
done
,
girl
,
let
me
know
your
decision!""You
will
have
it
,
then
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Emily
,
firmly
,
fixing
her
eye
unquailingly
upon
his
.
"
<EOS>
Then
hear
me
!
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
I
would
we
d
you
<EOS>
,
I
would
suffer
my
limbs
to
be
torn
from
me
one
by
one
!
<EOS>
Rather
than
embrace
you
,
I
would
go
into
some
old
charnel
house
,
and
clasp
to
my
bosom
the
loathsome
tenant
of
a
half
century
!
<EOS>
Sooner
than
endure
your
hateful
presence
,
I
would
seek
the
wildest
spot
on
these
mountains
,
and
make
my
bed
with
serpents
!
<EOS>
You
are
answered
.
<EOS>
"Astonishment
<EOS>
and
rage
for
a
time
kept
John
silent
;
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
Emily
went
on
.
<EOS>
"I
have
entreated
you
in
vain
to
restore
me
to
my
friends
and
home
.
<EOS>
You
have
mocked
me
by
your
replies
of
cowardly
threats
.
<EOS>
You
have
sought
to
intimidate
me
;
but
know
,
sir
,
I
have
a
spirit
,
when
roused
,
as
unbending
as
your
own
!
<EOS>
Now
hear
me
!
<EOS>
Let
me
go
in
peace
,
and
the
past
shall
be
forgotten
,
and
with
this
adventure
your
name
shall
never
be
coupled
.
<EOS>
Place
but
your
hand
upon
me
,
with
foul
intent
,
and
if
I
escape
,
I
will
expose
,
and
bring
you
to
that
justice
you
deserve
for
your
crimes!""Brave
girl
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
,
bursting
into
a
wild
,
fiendish
laugh
,
that
in
spite
of
her
,
made
Emily
's
blood
run
cold
,
and
her
heart
seem
to
shrink
within
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
talk
well
,
girl
,
well
;
but
do
you
know"—and
<EOS>
again
that
awful
smile
lingered
upon
his
features—"do
you
know
,
my
pretty
one
,
that
I
think
you
will
never
escape
to
put
your
threat
in
execution
.
<EOS>
You
think
,
then
,
that
my
threats
were
made
to
intimidate
you
?
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
said
you
did
not
know
me
!
<EOS>
Let
me
see
:
<EOS>
You
said
ere
<EOS>
you
would
we
d
me
<EOS>
,
you
would
be
torn
limb
from
limb
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha!—that
was
well
said
—
very
well
.
<EOS>
Again
:
Rather
than
embrace
me
,
you
would
clasp
to
your
innocent
bosom
some
mouldy
tenant
of
a
charnel
house
—
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Once
more
:
Sooner
than
endure
my
hateful
presence
,
you
would
make
a
bed
among
serpents
.
<EOS>
So
,
so
—
ha
,
ha
!
—
all
very
good
in
theory
;
but
I
presume
you
were
somewhat
excited
when
you
spoke
,
and
did
not
think
of
putting
them
in
practice
.
<EOS>
And
then
your
spirit
,
when
roused
,
is
as
unbending
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
we
shall
see
.
<EOS>
If
it
prove
so
,
girl
,
there
will
be
rare
sport
—
rare
sport
.
<EOS>
But
why
do
you
tremble
so
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
look
so
pale
?
<EOS>
Is
this
the
unbending
spirit
of
the
one
who
boasts
so
boldly
about
dying
?
<EOS>
I
trust
you
will
not
falter
now
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
Why
this
is
not
even
a
commeneement
.
<EOS>
Now
,
girl
,
you
must
know
that
I
care
as
little
about
life
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
seek
to
prolong
existence?—it
will
be
death
at
last
;
and
it
is
,
besides
,
sweet
to
die
to
get
revenge
;
and
it
will
be
doubly
sweet
to
die
in
your
sweet
company
,
girl!""Great
God
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
Emily
,
sinking
with
fright
upon
a
bench
,
as
,
having
listened
to
the
words
of
John
<EOS>
,
she
marked
the
awful
light
in
his
dark
,
snake
-
like
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
What
fearful
utterances
are
these?""I
was
simply
talking
about
dying
,
"
answered
John
;
"
and
thinking
how
pleasantly
we
could
die
together
.
<EOS>
I
regret
,
on
your
account
,
there
is
no
charnel
house
near
,
so
that
you
could
have
the
pleasure
of
hugging
a
corpse
;
but
as
to
the
snakes
,
I
think
you
can
be
well
accommodated
in
these
mountains!""For
God
-
sake
speak
the
worst
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Emily
,
who
felt
the
expressions
of
John
were
dethroning
her
reason
.
"Why
<EOS>
simply
this
,
"
replied
John
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
decided
to
put
me
to
extremes
.
<EOS>
Extremes
with
me
go
far
—
farther
,
perhaps
,
than
with
many
others
—
for
they
are
bounded
only
by
death
.
<EOS>
I
had
you
stolen
and
brought
hither
,
it
is
true
;
but
no
violence
was
offered
you
.
<EOS>
All
I
required
of
you
,
to
regain
your
liberty
,
was
merely
a
pledge
,
to
the
effect
that
you
would
be
mine
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
This
I
am
sure
was
honorable
,
though
you
saw
proper
to
think
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
waited
patiently
for
your
answer
,
and
at
length
received
it
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
In
that
answer
you
decided
the
fates
of
both
.
<EOS>
It
now
remains
for
me
to
fulfil
my
oath
;
which
was
,
you
remember
,
that
you
should
be
mine
;
whereby
I
implicitly
meant
you
should
be
mine
unto
death
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
dishonor
and
leave
you
here
,
you
would
escape
and
inform
on
me
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
murder
you
,
doubtless
it
would
leak
out
,
and
I
should
,
sooner
or
later
,
have
to
suffer
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
be
it
known
to
you
,
my
dear
girl
,
that
as
I
have
resolved
upon
what
the
world
would
term
your
dishonor
and
death
,
I
have
concluded
also
to
die
with
you
;
and
as
you
think
a
nest
of
serpents
an
agreeable
place
of
rest
,
compared
to
my
hateful
presence
,
why
I
have
concluded
to
find
one
,
and
rest
there
with
you
,
until
death
shall
rid
us
of
each
other
,
or
bind
us
more
strongly
together
in
another
state
.
<EOS>
"Emily
<EOS>
gasped
for
breath
,
and
placed
her
hands
before
her
eyes
,
as
if
to
shut
out
the
horrid
sight
imagination
had
already
conjured
up
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
show
you
I
am
in
earnest
,
"
continued
John
,
"
my
first
act
shall
be
one
of
justice
to
a
certain
rich
English
gentleman
,
now
probably
living
in
splendor
in
England
.
<EOS>
These
papers
,
dearest"—and
<EOS>
John
drew
forth
the
roll
he
had
received
from
the
Jew—"these
papers
speak
of
you
expressly
,
tell
who
you
are
,
who
were
your
parents
,
and
how
you
came
to
be
stolen
away
from
England
and
brought
to
this
country
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
interesting
documents
to
peruse
,
I
assure
you
,
and
are
signed
by
the
gentleman
who
had
the
honor
of
conducting
you
over
here
,
and
leaving
you
at
my
father
's
,
some
fifteen
years
ago
.
<EOS>
They
speak
well
of
you
,
and
seem
to
insinuate
your
birth
is
noble
.
<EOS>
Had
you
consented
to
marry
me
,
I
should
have
taken
great
pleasure
in
reading
them
to
you
;
but
as
matters
now
stand
,
I
do
not
like
to
waste
the
time
;
besides
,
as
you
and
I
are
not
long
for
this
world
,
it
were
better
not
to
set
our
minds
too
much
upon
worldly
things
;
therefore
you
will
excuse
me
for
putting
such
temptations
out
of
the
way
;
"
and
as
he
concluded
,
John
deliberately
tore
the
papers
into
a
thousand
pieces
,
and
cast
the
fragments
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
God
!
<EOS>
John
,
wherefore
this
torture
?
"
groaned
Emily
,
in
an
agony
of
mind
almost
insupportable
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
murder
me
at
once
—
for
death
to
this
is
a
thousand
times
<EOS>
preferable!""Do
<EOS>
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
Well
,
come
then
and
let
us
seek
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
approaching
,
John
grasped
her
by
the
arm
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
forth
,
girl
,
<EOS>
ere
Hetty
's
return
,
into
these
wild
woods
;
and
if
we
are
not
devoured
by
wild
beasts
ere
morning
,
we
will
in
company
,
on
the
morrow
,
seek
out
a
reptile
nest
,
and
there
die
quietly
together
.
<EOS>
Come
,
girl
,
come
!
"
<EOS>
and
quick
as
thought
John
raised
her
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Emily
uttered
one
wild
,
thrilling
scream
,
and
fainted
away
.
"
<EOS>
Screams
,
girl
,
will
avail
you
nothing
here
,
"
said
John
,
with
another
fiendish
laugh
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
started
,
and
Emily
slid
from
his
embrace
to
the
ground
,
in
a
state
of
insensibility
.
<EOS>
A
deep
voice
sounded
in
his
ear:"Ho
!
villain
and
traitor
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
next
moment
a
heavy
hand
laid
upon
his
shoulder
,
sent
him
reeling
to
the
farther
side
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
sir
,
then
you
are
caught
in
the
act!"John
<EOS>
looked
up
in
astonishment
and
rage
,
and
saw
before
him
the
powerful
and
commanding
form
of
Ronald
Bonardi
.
<EOS>
By
his
side
stood
the
lieutenant
,
and
between
himself
and
the
door
,
five
more
of
the
band
,
all
powerful
men
,
all
well
armed
,
with
pistols
and
hunting
knives
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
John
ran
his
dark
eye
rapidly
over
the
group
,
and
for
a
moment
seemed
to
waver
—
but
his
resolution
was
quickly
taken
.
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
was
to
shoot
down
Bonardi
,
and
trust
the
rest
to
chance
.
<EOS>
A
second
thought
altered
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
Resistance
now
would
be
followed
by
instant
death
—
duplicity
might
save
him
;
and
although
but
a
few
minutes
before
he
had
seemed
so
willing
to
die
,
yet
now
he
felt
differently
;
and
had
it
been
necessary
,
would
even
have
stooped
to
beg
his
life
,
were
it
only
to
get
revenge
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
said
,
John
's
resolution
was
quickly
taken
;
and
that
resolution
was
to
effect
by
duplicity
what
he
could
not
by
resistance
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
all
traces
of
anger
had
passed
from
his
features
,
and
in
a
calm
voice
he
said:"Captain
,
you
have
surprised
me
;
and
to
you
,
and
these
gentlemen
,
I
yield
myself
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
—
Circumstances
,
I
will
admit
,
are
against
me
;
but
all
I
ask
is
a
fair
trial
,
and
no
violence
.
<EOS>
You
have
disturbed
me
in
an
affair
of
love
;
and
who
of
you
,
gentlemen
,
has
not
at
sometime
had
one
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
know
our
laws
,
captain
,
and
am
willing
to
abide
by
them
.
<EOS>
Let
this
lady
bear
witness
,
and
I
am
content
.
<EOS>
I
crave
only
justice
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
that
,
John
Webber
,
you
shall
have
,
"
replied
Ronald
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Justice
you
shall
have
—
be
it
liberty
or
death
.
<EOS>
On
the
evidence
of
this
lady
,
and
another
,
shall
rest
your
fate
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
thing
further?""Only
,
most
noble
captain
,
that
I
may
be
treated
as
an
honorable
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
so
.
<EOS>
Piketon
,
you
will
conduct
him
,
guarded
by
these
men
,
to
the
cave
,
and
there
await
me
.
<EOS>
Unless
he
offer
resistance
,
touch
him
not
.
<EOS>
Should
he
do
so
,
shoot
him
on
the
spot!""Beware
on
him
,
beware
on
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hetty
,
rushing
in
,
<EOS>
who
thus
far
had
deemed
it
the
most
prudent
to
remain
without
.
<EOS>
"Silence
,
woman
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Bonardi
,
sternly
:
"
<EOS>
But
one
commands
here
!
<EOS>
Piketon
,
conduct
him
hence!""Ha
!
<EOS>
treachery
,
treachery
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
John
,
mentally
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fool,—fool
that
I
was
to
trust
in
woman
!
"
and
surrounded
by
Piketon
,
and
his
five
followers
,
he
disappeared
through
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
"Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
has
fainted
,
"
said
Ronald
,
turning
to
Emily
,
who
still
lay
upon
the
ground
;
and
carefully
raising
her
in
his
arms
,
he
laid
her
gently
upon
the
rude
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hetty
,
bring
the
light
hither
,
and
some
water
,
quick
!
"
<EOS>
Hetty
instantly
obeyed
,
and
as
the
light
gleamed
full
upon
her
fair
,
pale
,
marble
-
like
features
,
Ronald
started
,
and
his
brow
became
clouded
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
;
<EOS>
"
that
face
—
so
like
!
<EOS>
I
must
think
my
suspicions
correct
.
<EOS>
Hetty
,
sprinkle
the
water
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
There
,
there
,
that
is
sufficient
.
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
she
revives
.
<EOS>
How
is
she
called
,
Hetty?""She
's
called
Emily
Nevance
,
"
answered
Hetty
;
"
but
I
hearn
John
Webber
say
as
how
that
warn't
her
name
,
and
that
she
were
a
great
lady
.
<EOS>
""By
heavens
!
'
<EOS>
tis
so
.
<EOS>
How
strange
—
how
strange
,
that
we
should
meet
thus
,
for
the
first
time
!
<EOS>
Look
to
her
—
look
to
her
!
"
<EOS>
and
Ronald
turned
away
,
and
walked
to
and
fro
the
apartment
in
much
agitation
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Emily
revived
,
opened
her
eyes
with
a
shudder
,
and
fastened
them
upon
Hetty
,
who
was
bending
over
her
with
a
compassionate
look
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Emily
seemed
bewildered
;
and
then
,
with
a
scream
of
joy
,
she
sprang
up
and
clasped
Hetty
around
the
neck
,
crying
,
"
God
bless
you
,
Hetty
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
You
have
saved
me
,
good
woman
,
you
have
saved
me
from
a
fate
a
thousand
times
worse
than
death
!
"
and
overcome
by
her
feelings
,
she
sunk
back
completely
exhausted
.
<EOS>
"'Taint
<EOS>
me
that
's
done
it
,
gal
<EOS>
;
it
's
him
!
"
<EOS>
and
Hetty
pointed
to
Ronald
,
who
was
still
pacing
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
how
,
Hetty
?
"
enquired
Emily
,
as
soon
as
she
could
recover
strength
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
nothing
.
<EOS>
Where
is
John
Webber?""O
<EOS>
,
they
've
took
him
away
—
<EOS>
they've
got
<EOS>
him—"At
<EOS>
this
moment
came
the
sharp
report
of
two
pistols
,
followed
instantly
by
two
distinct
cries
of
distress
,
and
then
,
in
quick
succession
,
several
other
sharp
reports
,
and
louder
cries
of
a
different
nature
.
<EOS>
Emily
sprang
up
and
grasped
Hetty
in
terror
,
while
Ronald
bounded
to
the
door
,
and
rushed
forth
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
"What
ho
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
.
<EOS>
"
Piketon
,
what
ho
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
couple
of
minutes
<EOS>
and
he
was
joined
by
his
lieutenant
,
who
came
running
to
him
out
of
breath
.
<EOS>
"What
means
this
,
Piketon?—has
he
dared
to
resist?""He
has
escaped
,
captain!""Escaped
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Bonardi
,
in
astonishment
,
grasping
the
other
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
,
captain
;
he
shot
down
the
two
guards
nearest
him
and
fled
.
<EOS>
We
fired
several
shots
after
him
,
but
unluckily
all
missed
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
men
,
"
shouted
Ronald
,
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
;
"
fifty
guineas
to
him
who
takes
John
Webber
.
<EOS>
ere
morning
,
<EOS>
dead
or
alive!""The
offer
is
in
vain
,
captain
,
"
said
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
,
vain?""We
are
all
on
foot
.
<EOS>
His
horse
it
seems
was
in
waiting
below
,
which
he
reached
in
advance
of
us
,
and
mounted
ere
we
came
up
.
<EOS>
Ere
we
can
get
to
our
horses
,
he
will
have
full
twenty
miles
between
us
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
the
treacherous
villain
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Bonardi
,
with
a
terrible
oath
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
betray
,
and
have
the
country
roused
up
against
us
!
<EOS>
But
by
my
mother
's
soul
,
he
shall
not
escape
punishment
—
even
should
it
cost
me
my
own
life
!
<EOS>
Piketon
,
he
should
have
been
disarmed!""True
,
captain
.
<EOS>
""It
was
a
foolish
oversight
in
me
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
experience
is
a
good
teacher
.
<EOS>
The
smooth
-
tongued
hypocrite
!
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
he
would
venture
to
resist
—
least
of
all
,
escape
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
it
is
useless
whining
now
.
<EOS>
Call
in
your
men
,
Piketon
,
and
look
to
your
wounded
comrades
.
<EOS>
—
When
done
,
report
matters
,
and
I
will
give
you
farther
orders
.
<EOS>
So
,
so
—
dark
deeds
thicken
;
"
and
with
his
hand
pressed
upon
his
temples
,
Ronald
slowly
retraced
his
steps
up
the
hill
,
while
Piketon
sounded
the
recall
,
by
applying
a
piece
of
ivory
to
his
lips
,
that
gave
out
a
shrill
whistle
;
and
being
shortly
joined
by
three
of
his
party
,
proceeded
to
look
after
the
two
who
were
wounded
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Ronald
had
returned
and
entered
the
apartment
where
were
Emily
and
Hetty
,
both
pale
and
much
frightened
.
<EOS>
"Be
not
alarmed
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
mild
tone
;
"
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
.
<EOS>
""What
has
happened
,
kind
sir
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Emily
,
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"John
<EOS>
Webber
has
escaped
,
after
shooting
two
of
my
men
,
"
answered
Ronald
,
biting
his
nether
lip
.
<EOS>
"I
knowed
it
,
I
knowed
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hetty
.
—
<EOS>
"
He
's
the
greatest
villain
as
ever
run
!
<EOS>
I
told
you
beware
on
him!""And
<EOS>
I
should
have
heeded
your
warning
,
"
returned
Ronald
;
"
but
it
is
useless
to
repent
it
now
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
much
to
fear
from
him
,
"
said
Emily
,
respeetfully
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
;
and
you
,
Emily
—
for
such
I
am
told
is
your
name
—
have
had
much
to
fear
,
"
rejoined
Ronald
,
approaching
her
.
<EOS>
"Kind
<EOS>
sir
,
"
returned
Emily
,
casting
upon
him
a
grateful
look
,
and
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
her
late
narrow
escape
,
"
to
you
,
and
this
good
woman
<EOS>
,
I
owe
my
life
—
ay
,
more
than
life
—
and
I
lack
for
words
to
express
to
you
both
the
deep
thanks
I
feel
;
"
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
<EOS>
"Your
look
,
Emily
,
is
thanks
sufficient
,
"
replied
Ronald
,
affected
by
her
earnest
manner
.
<EOS>
"
In
my
heart
I
already
feel
more
than
repaid
for
what
little
I
have
done
;
and
besides
,
there
is
another
chord
touched
,
Emily
,
that
you
dream
not
of
.
<EOS>
I
regret
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
restore
you
to
your
anxious
friends
,
immediately
—
and
to
one
,
the
dearest
friend
of
all
—
but
I
will
do
so
as
soon
as
practicable
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
I
beg
of
you
to
put
yourself
under
my
guidance
,
and
accept
of
my
hospitality
.
<EOS>
My
wife
will
be
delighted
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
""You
are
then
,
married
?
"
said
Emily
.
<EOS>
"I
am
,
"
replied
Ronald
,
sadly
,
"
to
a
lovely
being
,
far
too
good
and
gentle
for
one
like
me
,
and
of
my
calling
.
<EOS>
But
let
that
pass
;
you
shall
see
her
and
judge
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
presume
<EOS>
Hetty
has
already
informed
you
who
I
am
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
my
name
is
familiar
to
your
ear
,
coupled
with
every
thing
that
is
wicked
and
base?""I
have
heard
somewhat
of
you
that
should
have
been
otherwise
,
"
answered
Emily
;
"
though
I
have
also
heard
of
many
acts
of
your
generosity
,
which
go
to
prove
you
possess
,
notwithstanding
,
a
kind
heart
.
<EOS>
""Thank
you
!
"
returned
Ronald
,
deeply
affected
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
man
of
circumstances
,
Emily
,
and
circumstances
have
made
me
what
I
am
.
<EOS>
You
little
dream
how
closely
you
are
connected
with
those
circumstances
.
<EOS>
""Me
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Emily
,
in
astonishment
.
"Ay
!
<EOS>
but
let
it
pass
now
.
<EOS>
Anon
I
will
explain
all
.
<EOS>
As
in
coming
here
,
and
by
what
will
follow
,
I
have
in
a
measure
placed
myself
and
others
—
or
at
least
the
secret
of
our
existence
and
rendezvous
—
in
your
power
,
you
will
,
I
trust
,
think
nothing
hard
of
me
,
if
I
exact
from
you
a
sacred
pledge
,
that
what
you
have
learned
,
seen
and
heard
,
or
shall
learn
,
see
and
hear
,
you
will
never
—
under
any
circumstances
whatever
—
divulge
while
I
am
living
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
this
most
solemnly
I
pledge
me
,
"
returned
Emily
,
"
and
call
God
to
witness
the
vow
!
<EOS>
What
you
have
done
,
has
been
to
save
me
from
an
awful
fate
;
and
were
I
to
take
advantage
of
this
against
you
,
I
should
truly
be
the
most
ungrateful
of
my
sex
—
ay
,
unworthy
the
name
of
woman
.
<EOS>
You
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
,
kind
sir
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
enough!—your
simple
word
is
enough
—
I
ask
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
so
soon
as
my
lieutenant
returns
,
you
will
with
me
to
the
cave
.
<EOS>
But
,
ha
!
what
have
we
here
,
torn
into
so
many
fragments
?
"
<EOS>
added
he
,
enquiringly
,
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
papers
destroyed
by
John
a
few
minutes
before
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
I
suppose
them
to
be
proofs
of
my
parentage
,
"
answered
Emily
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
this
too
was
the
work
of
<EOS>
John
Webber?""It
was
.
<EOS>
""The
villain
!
<EOS>
But
we
shall
meet
again
,
ere
long
;
and
then
there
will
be
a
reckoning
—
a
squaring
of
accounts
,
"
said
Ronald
,
with
quivering
lips
,
while
a
dark
shade
rested
on
his
counte
nance
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
what
was
written
thereon?""I
do
not
.
<EOS>
""Did
<EOS>
he
mention
the
names
of
your
parents?""He
did
not
;
and
said
unless
I
would
consent
to
marry
him
,
I
should
never
learn
them
.
<EOS>
""In
that
he
was
mistaken
<EOS>
—
for
I
will
inform
you
.
<EOS>
""You
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Emily
,
starting
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Ay
!
<EOS>
yet
hold
a
moment
!
<EOS>
Possibly
I
may
myself
be
mistaken
;
"
and
gathering
up
several
of
the
pieces
,
Ronald
examined
them
by
the
light
a
few
moments
,
attentively
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
"
continued
he
,
at
length
;
"
I
am
right
;
my
suspicions
were
correct
.
<EOS>
""Oh
<EOS>
then
,
sir
,
"
cried
Emily
,
breathlessly
,
"
I
beseech
<EOS>
you
inform
me!""I
will
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
legitimate
daughter
,
only
living
child
,
and
truly
legal
heir
of—""Fenton
is
dead
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Piketon
,
at
this
moment
rushing
in
and
interrupting
him
.
<EOS>
"Dead
!
"
echoed
Bonardi
,
staggering
back
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
captain
.
<EOS>
Webber
's
ball
entered
the
left
breast
,
near
the
heart
,
and
he
has
just
this
moment
expired
.
<EOS>
""A
thousand
curses
on
the
villain
!
<EOS>
And
the
other?""Is
not
mortally
wounded
.
<EOS>
His
shoulder
-
blade
is
broken
.
<EOS>
"Bonardi
<EOS>
pressed
his
hands
hard
against
his
temples
,
and
tried
to
look
calm
;
but
there
came
,
notwithstanding
,
a
dark
and
terrible
expression
upon
his
features
.
<EOS>
"This
,
Piketon
,
"
said
he
,
at
length
,
in
a
deep
,
heavy
voice
,
"
is
too
much
—
too
much
!
<EOS>
You
will
return
and
see
to
the
burial
of
Fenton
,
poor
fellow
,
and
that
the
other
is
well
attended
to
.
<EOS>
Better
leave
him
at
Mosley
's
,
as
he
is
something
of
a
surgeon
himself
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
all
is
complete
,
meet
me
at
the
cave
,
with
as
many
of
our
band
as
you
can
easily
collect
.
<EOS>
Webber
must
be
punished
!
<EOS>
—
Send
hither
Kelly
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
captain!"As
Piketon
departed
,
Bonardi
strode
to
and
fro
the
apartment
,
in
great
agitation
,
until
the
arrival
of
Kelly
,
when
turning
to
Emily
,
he
said:"Pardon
me
,
Emily
<EOS>
,
I
am
too
much
agitated
,
just
at
present
,
to
continue
the
subject
on
which
we
were
speaking
.
<EOS>
I
will
resume
it
anon
,
and
tell
you
all
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
ready
now
,
we
will
hence
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
regret
my
gallant
steed
is
not
with
me
,
as
I
fear
the
distance
will
fatigue
you
—
it
being
some
seven
miles
,
and
for
the
most
part
over
a
rough
country
.
<EOS>
""Thank
you
<EOS>
,
"
returned
Emily
,
"
for
the
generous
regard
you
are
pleased
to
express
in
my
behalf
;
but
I
doubt
not
I
can
easily
walk
it
;
I
have
sometimes
done
as
much
,
and
felt
it
not
.
<EOS>
""We
will
then
set
forth
.
<EOS>
Kelly
,
you
will
accompany
us
;
"
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
party
were
on
their
way
to
the
cave
.
<EOS>
Emily
,
however
,
had
counted
too
strongly
on
her
own
powers
;
for
worn
out
with
excitement
,
and
weakened
by
loss
of
rest
and
food
,
she
soon
found
her
limbs
failing
her
;
and
ere
they
had
reached
a
mile
,
she
sunk
down
completely
exhausted
.
<EOS>
Ronald
immediately
raised
her
in
his
arms
,
without
apparent
effort
,
and
the
party
again
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Kelly
occasionally
relieved
him
,
and
in
this
manner
they
reached
their
destination
,
in
something
over
two
hours
from
their
time
of
starting
.
<EOS>
The
sentinel
looked
much
surprised
,
on
seeing
Ronald
descend
the
ladder
with
a
lady
in
his
arms
,
but
as
it
was
no
business
of
his
,
he
made
no
remark
.
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
,
Inez
and
Cyntha
were
no
less
surprised
;
nor
was
their
surprise
lessened
by
the
manner
of
Ronald
,
who
was
laboring
under
great
mental
excitement
.
<EOS>
Placing
Emily
carefully
upon
one
of
the
sofas
,
he
turned
abruptly
to
his
wife
,
and
said:"Inez
,
as
you
love
me
,
look
well
to
this
lady
;
for
she
has
been
foully
dealt
with
,
and
has
need
of
your
most
tender
care
.
<EOS>
"Inez
looked
at
him
steadily
a
moment
,
and
her
features
assumed
a
strange
expression
.
<EOS>
Ronald
noticed
it
,
and
immediately
added:"Nay
,
love
,
no
jealousy
.
<EOS>
This
woman
will
explain
all
;
"
and
he
turned
to
Hetty
,
who
,
having
followed
him
in
,
now
stood
gazing
around
upon
the
splendor
of
the
apartment
,
with
a
surprised
and
bewildered
look
.
<EOS>
"O
<EOS>
yes
,
"
returned
Hetty
,
who
had
heard
the
allusion
to
herself
;
"
I
'll
tell
this
ar
'
beautiful
lady
all
as
I
knows
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
why
,
dear
Ronald
,
do
you
leave
me
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
Inez
,
sadly
,
as
he
turned
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"I
have
weighty
matters
to
which
I
must
attend
immediately
,
"
answered
Ronald
,
drawing
her
fondly
to
him
,
and
pressing
his
lips
to
hers
.
<EOS>
"
Be
not
uneasy
,
dear
Inez
,
I
shall
pass
the
night
in
the
Outer
Cave
.
<EOS>
But
look
to
that
young
lady
,
for
she
is
faint
and
sick
;
"
and
as
Inez
turned
to
Emily
,
Ronald
withdrew
,
and
closed
the
stone
door
behind
him
.
<EOS>
When
in
the
larger
cave
,
and
with
the
exception
of
the
sentinel
entirely
alone
,
Bonardi
paced
to
and
fro
in
an
excited
mood
,
while
the
muscles
of
his
face
underwent
various
changes
,
and
his
hands
clenched
and
unclenched
,
as
one
in
deep
agony
of
mind
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
he
continued
some
hour
and
a
half
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
Piketon
,
with
some
twenty
of
the
band
,
whom
he
had
found
in
the
Retreat
,
as
it
was
called
—
a
kind
of
hostlery
,
some
half
mile
distant
,
kept
by
one
of
the
party
,
where
,
on
the
nights
of
their
meetings
,
the
members
who
had
ridden
from
a
distance
,
generally
left
their
horses
to
be
fed
,
and
not
unfrequently
spent
the
night
themselves
,
in
drinking
,
card
playing
,
and
the
like
;
and
where
the
sentinels
boarded
and
slept
,
and
,
when
not
on
duty
,
could
generally
be
found
.
<EOS>
This
Retreat
was
kept
by
one
Mosley
,
who
was
the
one
designated
by
Bonardi
,
in
his
directions
to
Piketon
concerning
leaving
his
wounded
comrade
.
<EOS>
The
Hollow
,
where
Bonardi
had
found
Piketon
,
and
the
five
who
accompanied
him
,
was
another
place
of
a
similar
character
,
some
half
mile
farther
on
.
<EOS>
"Captain
,
"
said
Piketon
,
approaching
Bonardi
,
"
I
have
obeyed
your
orders
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
Do
these
fellows
know
what
has
taken
place?""They
know
that
John
Webber
has
proved
treacherous
,
and
shot
Fenton
and
Allen
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
say
they?""They
have
but
one
voice
:
`
Death
to
the
traitor
!
"
'
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
and
by
—
he
shall
not
escape
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bonardi
,
fiercely
,
uttering
an
oath
.
"
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
he
or
I
must
die!""I
trust
not
you
,
captain
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
know
,
"
said
Ronald
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
something
tells
me
I
am
not
long
for
this
world
.
<EOS>
—
It
may
be
only
a
foolish
fancy
—
but
let
it
pass
.
—
<EOS>
At
dawn
to
-
morrow
we
must
mount
and
follow
him
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
we
shall
find
him
at
his
father
's
.
<EOS>
No
matter
where
,
however
,
when
found
he
must
die
!
<EOS>
I
hope
we
may
meet
him
ere
<EOS>
he
has
betrayed
us
fully
,
but
I
fear
not
.
<EOS>
Ten
of
these
fellows
must
remain
here
,
to
guard
the
cave
—
the
others
will
with
us
.
<EOS>
You
will
divide
them
,
and
leave
the
truest
and
most
courageous
here
.
<EOS>
How
now
!
<EOS>
what
means
this
?
"
<EOS>
This
last
remark
was
occasioned
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
new
comer
,
who
,
having
descended
the
ladder
,
approached
Bonardi
direct
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
news
,
<EOS>
Ellis?""The
steamer
leaves
to
-
morrow
,
captain
,
between
the
hours
of
five
and
seven
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
,
Ellis?""I
had
it
from
the
officers
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
""So
soon
!
<EOS>
this
is
unlucky
.
<EOS>
When
got
you
the
information?""At
noon
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
started
out
of
St.
Louis
late
last
night
,
and
have
scarcely
been
out
of
my
saddle
since
.
<EOS>
I
have
fatigued
two
horses
,
and
am
now
rather
fatigued
myself
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
done
well

Ellis
,
for

tis
a
hard
ride
—
a
very
hard
ride

<EOS>
To
-
morrow
night
—
how
unlucky
!
<EOS>
What
could
have
induced
them
to
alter
their
time?—for
when
I
saw
them
,
they
positively
asserted
they
would
not
leave
within
a
week
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Piketon
,
what
can
be
done
?
<EOS>
It
is
almost
impossible
for
us
to
reach
the
rendezvous
in
time
—
certainly
we
can
not
without
a
relay
.
<EOS>
How
unlucky
this
news
did
not
arrive
sooner
,
ere
<EOS>
the
meeting
had
broken
up
!
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
we
must
do
our
best
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
we
must
let
Webber
pass
—
at
least
this
other
business
must
be
attended
to
first
.
<EOS>
Ellis
,
have
the
small
boats
been
dropped
down
to
old
Davids?""Ay
,
captain

that
was
done
last
night

<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
Piketon

leave
ten

singly
ride

them
they
must
reach
there
ere
<EOS>
sunset
to

morrow

or
the
prize
will
be
lost

<EOS>
By
going
singly
,
and
separate
routes
,
they
will
be
enabled
to
get
relays
among
the
settlers
,
without
exciting
suspicion
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
long
fatiguing
ride
of
a
hundred
miles
,
and
I
do
not
count
on
our
band
being
there
in
full
—
still
I
trust
there
will
be
enough
to
capture
the
money
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
yourself
give
the
signal
,
as
soon
as
possible

<EOS>
Doubtless
you
will
be
enabled
to
overtake
some
of
the
band
on
their
way
home

In
every
case
,
tell
them

must
reach
there

<EOS>
Where
is
Hendrick?""He
has
gone
with
four
comrades
to
arrest
Saxton

Niles

who
I
have
learned
are
in
this
vicinity

""Right

strictly
guarded

hither

now
to
spend
an
hour
with
Inez

then
for
action

I
have
a
noble
steed
at
the
Retreat

relays
on

route

so
that
doubtless
I
shall
be
there
in
advance
of
you

By
the
by

tell
those
who
remain
here
as
guards

that
if
we
are
successful

shall
share
equally
with

now
,
Piketon
,
speed
!
<EOS>
speed
!

there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost

<EOS>
saying
which

Bonardi
turned
abruptly
on
his
heel
,
and
entered

Inner
Cave

the
lieutenant

with
great
rapidity

precision

CHAPTER
II.THE
RENDEZVOUS
—
THE
ATTACK
—
THE
TERRIBLE
FIGHT
—
<EOS>
THE
AWFUL
EXPLOSION
—
THE
FLIGHT
AND
PURSUIT.In
<EOS>
something
less
than
an
hour
from
the
close
of
the
events
detailed
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
a
single
horseman
was
riding
swiftly
through
that
range
of
country
lying
between
the
Osage
and
the
great
"
Father
of
Waters"—as
it
is
sometimes
called
—
and
extending
south
of
the
Missouri
some
thirty
miles
.
<EOS>
Ever
and
anon
this
horseman
would
pause
beside
some
peace
-
looking
cottage
,
and
sound
three
clear
distinct
blasts
on
a
bugle
;
and
then
a
dark
figure
or
two
would
be
seen
to
glide
forth
from
his
covert
,
a
few
hurried
words
would
be
said
in
a
low
voice
;
and
then
again
the
single
horseman
would
dash
on
,
as
though
riding
for
life
,
while
shortly
after
,
from
the
place
he
had
just
quitted
,
another
horseman
—
sometimes
two
or
three
—
would
ride
forth
with
speed
,
as
though
in
hot
pursuit
of
the
one
who
had
gone
before
.
<EOS>
When
the
grey
dawn
of
morning
had
begun
to
trace
the
outline
of
hills
,
and
trees
,
and
streams
,
in
a
soft
,
hazy
relief
,
it
revealed
too
the
dim
outline
of
that
same
horseman
,
far
to
the
eastward
of
where
he
had
been
seen
at
the
hour
of
midnight
,
still
speeding
on
as
before
,
yet
ever
and
anon
pausing
to
sound
three
musical
blasts
on
a
bugle
,
which
he
bore
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
As
the
sun
rose
in
beauty
over
the
eastern
hills
,
and
poured
his
gentle
rays
into
deep
green
woods
,
into
pleasant
valleys
,
on
to
sparkling
streams
,
they
occasionally
cast
back
the
shadow
of
that
horseman
,
still
speeding
on
,
and
the
shadows
too
of
various
other
horsemen
—
some
directly
in
his
trail
,
some
in
different
points
of
compass
from
him
—
all
speeding
eastward
.
<EOS>
As
the
day
wore
on
,
he
was
seen
mounted
on
a
different
horse
,
still
urging
on
the
noble
animal
,
which
at
every
step
and
bound
neared
him
to
the
great
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
When
the
sun
had
far
declined
toward
the
western
horizon
,
that
horseman
drew
rein
beside
an
old
hovel
,
which
stood
on
the
west
bank
of
the
great
river
,
and
but
a
short
time
since
inhabited
by
old
David
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
he
paused
,
when
a
tall
figure
darted
out
of
the
hovel
,
and
Ronald
Bonardi
stood
beside
him
.
"Welcome
,
Piketon
,
welcome
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
latter
,
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
feared
you
would
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
should
be
here
before
you
;
but
your
task
has
been
much
the
hardest
,
as
I
can
perceive
by
your
wearied
looks
;
and
your
horse
too
hangs
his
head
sadly
,
and
drips
water
like
rain
.
<EOS>
But
what
news
of
the
others
?
<EOS>
Will
the
main
body
of
them
be
here
in
time?""I
trust
<EOS>
it
will
,
captain
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
be
far
behind
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
the
way
,
Piketon
,
ten
of
them
have
already
arrived
,
and
are
concealed
—
horses
and
all
—
in
the
bushes
just
below
here
.
<EOS>
As
the
boat
leaves
St.
Louis
at
an
hour
so
late
,
I
think
this
will
be
our
best
point
of
attack
;
and
by
heavens
!
<EOS>
since
we
are
here
,
the
attack
shall
be
made
,
whether
the
others
arrive
or
not
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
go
in
,
go
in
and
refresh
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
wine
and
food
on
the
table
;
for
the
one
who
came
down
with
the
small
boats
,
had
the
good
foresight
to
provide
both
,
as
well
as
plenty
of
grain
for
the
horses
.
<EOS>
Go
in
,
Piketon
,
while
I
lead
your
horse
into
the
covert
below
,
when
I
will
immediately
join
you
.
<EOS>
""Thank
<EOS>
you
,
captain
!
<EOS>
I
feel
that
wine
and
food
are
every
thing
to
me
now
;
"
and
Piketon
entered
the
hovel
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
Bonardi
was
with
him
.
<EOS>
"I
hear
the
tramp
of
more
horses
,
"
said
the
latter
,
as
he
entered
,
"
so
that
doubtless
our
party
will
soon
be
increased
;
and
in
fact
it
needs
be
soon
,
to
be
of
any
service
to
us
,
for
the
sun
al
ready
dips
in
the
trees
of
the
western
mountains
,
and
the
boat
will
probably
pass
here
at
early
dark
,
though
I
hope
not
till
a
later
hour
.
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
they
come
;
"
and
Bonardi
turned
back
to
the
door
,
just
as
three
horseman
rode
up
from
different
points
of
compass
—
<EOS>
their
horses
dripping
water
,
and
themselves
looking
much
fatigued
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
Bonardi
given
them
directions
how
to
dispose
of
themselves
,
when
up
rode
two
more
—
and
then
another
,
and
another
.
<EOS>
In
fact
they
were
now
gathering
fast
;
and
in
less
time
than
an
hour
,
the
party
of
twelve
had
swelled
to
upwards
of
forty
,
all
strong
and
well
armed
men
.
<EOS>
The
sun
,
in
the
meantime
,
had
gone
down
,
and
grey
twilight
was
already
deepening
into
night
,
when
Bonardi
,
thinking
that
longer
delay
might
prove
fatal
to
his
design
,
now
ordered
his
men
to
take
up
their
positions
,
and
be
in
readiness
for
action
.
<EOS>
Some
five
or
six
boats
,
lying
concealed
in
the
water
below
,
were
instantly
manned
,
while
four
of
the
party
were
stationed
above
,
at
different
points
,
as
look
-
outs
or
sentinels
,
ready
to
give
warning
in
case
of
danger
,
and
likewise
directions
to
the
new
comers
,
as
fast
as
they
should
arrive
,
which
they
were
continually
doing
.
<EOS>
Three
others
were
to
hail
the
steamer
,
and
,
should
she
send
out
a
small
boat
,
which
was
probable
,
six
more
were
to
be
in
attendance
to
seize
and
gag
the
oarsmen
.
<EOS>
In
fact
the
attack
was
to
be
made
precisely
according
to
the
plan
given
out
by
Bonardi
,
as
detailed
in
a
previous
chapter
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
his
men
disposed
of
according
to
his
directions
,
Bonardi
went
to
each
of
the
sentinels
,
and
charged
them
to
be
vigilant
,
as
it
was
not
impossible
that
Webber
,
in
a
spirit
of
revenge
,
had
already
blown
the
scheme
,
and
,
by
being
sharply
on
the
look
-
out
,
been
enabled
to
learn
of
their
sudden
movements
,
the
time
of
the
steamer
's
departure
,
and
also
to
collect
a
force
sufficient
to
attack
them
.
<EOS>
Should
they
see
or
hear
any
thing
they
might
judge
indicative
of
danger
,
without
being
positive
,
they
were
to
give
the
signal
by
a
shrill
whistle
—
if
positive
,
by
discharging
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
In
case
of
an
attack
,
they
were
to
fight
in
any
manner
they
might
see
proper
;
but
in
case
they
heard
a
blast
from
the
bugle
,
they
were
to
make
their
way
,
quickly
as
possible
,
to
the
spot
whence
it
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Having
given
these
directions
to
the
sentinels
,
Bonardi
repaired
to
the
members
whose
duty
it
was
to
act
on
land
—
told
them
his
suspicions
—
his
orders
to
the
sentinels
regarding
signals
,
and
an
attack
—
the
latter
of
which
referred
equally
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
returned
to
the
boats
,
repeated
all
he
had
said
,
and
took
his
station
in
one
of
them
,
ready
to
lead
them
on
when
the
proper
moment
should
arrive
.
<EOS>
All
now
gradually
sunk
into
deep
silence
,
for
each
one
of
that
band
of
outlaws
was
busy
with
thoughts
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
They
were
awaiting
,
under
cover
of
darkness
,
to
make
an
attack
,
where
,
in
all
probability
,
more
or
less
lives
would
be
lost
;
and
doubtless
many
a
one
felt
a
secret
foreboding
that
this
might
be
his
last
night
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Although
Bonardi
,
after
giving
his
orders
,
said
nothing
,
yet
he
appeared
very
restless
,
and
seemed
greatly
disturbed
by
some
inward
trouble
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
passed
some
fifteen
minutes
,
when
he
leaped
suddenly
ashore
,
and
merely
saying
he
would
be
with
them
again
presently
,
strode
directly
up
the
hill
,
and
entered
the
hovel
.
<EOS>
Here
he
found
a
bottle
,
which
he
applied
to
his
lips
,
and
,
judging
by
the
time
he
held
it
there
,
drank
much
.
<EOS>
He
then
returned
to
the
boats
with
a
heavy
step
.
<EOS>
"Strange
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
approached
,
"
that
I
hear
nothing
of
her
!
<EOS>
Piketon
,
it
is
possible
Ellis
may
have
been
mistaken
in
the
time
.
<EOS>
""It
is
possible
,
captain
,
"
answered
Piketon
,
"
though
<EOS>
but
now
I
fancied
I
heard
her
.
""Hark
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Bonardi
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Piketon
,
you
are
right
;
by
heavens
she
comes
!
<EOS>
Be
ready
,
men
,
be
ready
—
then
be
silent!"A
few
minutes
fully
confirmed
the
approach
of
a
steamer
;
for
although
not
in
sight
,
yet
the
puffing
sound
produced
by
the
escape
of
steam
,
was
clearly
audible
to
the
anxious
listeners
.
<EOS>
Ere
she
rounded
the
point
just
above
,
it
became
evident
by
the
change
of
sound
,
that
she
was
effecting
a
landing
;
but
presently
she
was
again
in
motion
;
and
then
on
she
came
,
like
some
terrific
monster
,
with
great
red
eyes
of
fire
,
and
smoke
and
flame
issuing
from
its
nostrils
.
<EOS>
On
,
on
she
came
,
bearing
down
apparently
directly
towards
those
dark
spirits
,
who
were
impatiently
waiting
their
time
for
action
.
<EOS>
Soon
she
was
within
speaking
distance
,
when
she
was
immediately
hailed
from
the
shore
,
which
was
answered
by
the
ringing
of
a
bell
.
<EOS>
The
steam
was
next
thrown
off
,
and
she
commenced
rounding
to
,
apparently
with
much
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"We
can
not
land
,
"
said
a
voice
from
on
board
,
"
and
our
boat
has
been
stove
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
no
boat
,
we
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
this
looks
suspicious
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Ronald
,
mentally
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
trial
must
be
made
.
<EOS>
Quick
,
Jeffrey
,
"
cried
he
,
leaping
ashore
,
and
running
up
to
the
group
of
three
,
who
stood
as
though
awaiting
further
orders
,
"
cry
back
there
is
a
boat
here
,
and
a
man
who
will
row
you
to
them
!
<EOS>
and
then
hie
to
it
,
and
do
not
forget
your
instructions
.
<EOS>
You
,
"
continued
he
,
turning
to
another
group
of
twelve
,
standing
a
few
feet
distant
,
six
of
whom
had
but
lately
arrived
,
"
will
remain
here
to
cover
us
.
<EOS>
I
am
suspicious
,
from
various
slight
causes
,
that
we
shall
be
attacked
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
,
fight
,
men
,
fight
like
devils
,
and
we
will
soon
join
you
!
"
<EOS>
—
Saying
this
in
a
low
,
rapid
tone
,
Bonardi
hurried
back
and
sprang
into
his
boat
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Jeffrey
had
done
the
captain
's
bidding
,
with
great
rapidity
,
and
was
even
now
,
with
his
two
comrades
,
shoving
off
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
this
time
so
dark
,
that
a
small
boat
on
the
water
could
be
seen
only
at
a
short
distance
,
save
when
it
crossed
the
lights
gleaming
out
from
the
larger
one
;
consequently
the
other
boats
remained
in
close
obscurity
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
a
minute
elapsed
,
ere
a
boat
,
containing
three
individuals
,
was
seen
crossing
the
bow
of
the
steamer
.
<EOS>
"Stand
<EOS>
to
your
oars
,
men
!
"
said
Bonardi
,
rapidly
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
hear
the
signal
in
a
moment
;
and
then
,
as
you
love
money
,
forget
not
to
row
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
there
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
there
came
several
reports
of
firearms
,
and
the
next
instant
five
boats
shot
out
into
the
stream
,
with
lightning
rapidity
.
<EOS>
But
a
few
seconds
elapsed
ere
they
were
alongside
the
steamer
,
when
,
just
as
Bonardi
was
on
the
point
of
leaping
aboard
,
the
engineer
suddenly
let
on
a
full
head
of
steam
,
the
wheels
turned
quickly
,
the
boat
shot
forwad
instantly
,
crushing
one
of
the
smaller
ones
,
and
at
the
same
time
a
murderous
fire
was
directed
among
the
bandits
,
from
a
hitherto
concealed
enemy
,
doing
terrible
execution
.
<EOS>
Several
of
them
sprang
up
and
fell
back
dead
,
against
their
comrades
,
or
into
the
water
,
while
others
sank
down
wounded
,
amid
shrieks
,
groans
,
and
direful
imprecations
.
<EOS>
To
add
to
the
consternation
and
horror
of
Ronald
and
his
men
,
the
pistols
of
the
sentinels
on
the
hill
were
now
heard
in
quick
succession
,
followed
by
a
roar
of
musketry
,
rapid
discharge
of
pistols
,
fierce
yells
and
groans
,
and
the
noise
of
a
hand
-
to
-
hand
combat
.
<EOS>
By
the
light
of
the
discharges
,
Ronald
saw
the
men
he
had
left
on
shore
,
hemmed
in
by
overwhelming
numbers
,
fighting
desperately
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
all
the
holy
saints
!
<EOS>
"
cried
he
,
"
we
are
betrayed
!
<EOS>
To
shore
!
<EOS>
To
horse!"Scarcely
were
the
words
uttered
,
ere
every
boat
seemed
almost
to
leap
from
the
water
—
so
powerfully
were
the
oars
applied
by
desperate
men
.
<EOS>
But
a
landing
was
not
to
be
effected
without
trouble
.
<EOS>
As
the
boats
touched
the
shore
,
a
party
in
waiting
poured
a
destructive
fire
among
them
,
and
numbers
fell
.
<EOS>
"Onward
!
"
shouted
Bonardi
;
and
leaping
on
to
the
bank
,
pistols
in
hand
,
he
shot
down
the
two
nearest
him
—
dashed
out
the
brains
of
a
third
with
one
of
his
discharged
weapons
—
seized
the
fourth
as
though
he
were
a
child
,
and
threw
him
over
his
head
into
the
Mississippi
—
drew
his
knife
,
and
literally
cut
his
way
through
them
,
unharmed
,
followed
by
Piketon
,
and
some
twenty
of
his
band
—
all
fighting
like
fiends
,
neither
giving
nor
asking
quarter
.
"Sound
<EOS>
the
bugle
,
and
to
horse
!
"
shouted
Bonardi
.
<EOS>
Instantly
a
loud
,
clear
blast
,
rang
out
upon
the
air
;
and
following
their
brave
leader
,
the
bandits
rushed
down
the
stream
some
thirty
yards
,
to
where
their
horses
stood
in
waiting
—
not
having
as
yet
been
discovered
by
the
attacking
party
.
<EOS>
—
Bounding
into
their
saddles
,
with
the
agility
of
men
<EOS>
well
trained
to
horsemanship
,
with
their
knives
still
in
their
hands
,
reeking
with
blood
,
they
cut
the
reins
that
attached
them
to
the
small
trees
of
the
thicket
,
in
which
they
were
concealed
,
and
,
plunging
their
spurs
into
their
sides
,
rode
wildly
out
,
with
a
fierce
yell
of
triumph
,
just
as
their
pursuers
were
coming
up
.
<EOS>
"Charge
,
comrades
,
charge
!
"
<EOS>
again
shouted
,
in
thunder
tones
,
the
voice
of
Bonardi
.
"
<EOS>
Down
in
your
saddles
,
and
knives
to
their
hearts!"Never
was
a
terrible
order
obeyed
more
rapidly
.
<EOS>
At
the
word
,
each
wheeled
into
a
line
with
his
leader
—
threw
himself
forward
,
until
his
head
touched
his
horse
's
neck
—
extended
his
arm
,
until
the
blade
of
his
knife
reached
beyond
the
nostrils
of
the
animal
he
rode
—
and
<EOS>
then
,
like
a
sweeping
avalanche
,
the
whole
party
spurred
down
upon
the
main
body
of
their
opponents
,
whom
they
stabbed
and
rode
over
,
with
a
havoc
that
,
in
honorable
warfare
,
would
have
rendered
the
charge
immortal
.
<EOS>
But
all
was
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
bandits
had
been
surprised
and
taken
at
too
great
a
disadvantage
to
themselves
,
by
nearly
double
their
numbers
,
to
cope
successfully
with
their
adversaries
now
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
the
latter
had
discovered
the
remaining
horses
,
and
were
already
mounting
them
.
<EOS>
In
the
charge
just
made
,
five
more
of
his
party
had
gone
down
;
so
that
out
of
all
his
stout
,
hardy
followers
,
Bonardi
found
,
on
sounding
the
bugle
again
,
only
some
fifteen
who
answered
to
the
summons
.
<EOS>
The
remainder
he
supposed
either
killed
,
wounded
,
or
taken
prisoners
,
as
the
firing
and
noise
of
combat
had
ceased
.
<EOS>
"We
are
lost
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
sadly
,
reining
in
his
horse
,
some
hundred
yards
from
the
scene
of
action
.
<EOS>
"
Comrades
,
our
day
is
over
.
<EOS>
All
that
men
could
do
,
under
the
circumstances
,
we
have
done
.
<EOS>
You
,
comrades
,
have
fought
like
men
—
most
bravely
—
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
to
what
avail
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
treachery
,
treachery
!
<EOS>
But
,
comrades
,
you
may
yet
escape
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
to
go
,
I
give
you
freedom
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
shall
back
to
the
cave
,
and
,
if
necessary
,
die
defending
it
.
<EOS>
My
time
I
feel
is
near
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Forty
brave
fellows
—
all
lost
—
all
lost
!
<EOS>
Oh
God
,
what
a
thought
!
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
comrades
;
will
you
leave
or
follow
me?""Follow
,
to
the
death
!
"
shouted
all
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
Let
us
away
then
,
ere
these
hellhounds
get
too
close
upon
our
track
;
for
they
have
mounted
our
own
horses
,
and
are
now
on
the
move
.
<EOS>
Ha!—the
steamer
—
look
!
<EOS>
Great
God
,
<EOS>
what
a
sight!"What
a
sight
indeed
!
<EOS>
for
just
as
Bonardi
spoke
,
there
came
a
tremendous
explosion
,
and
the
heads
,
legs
and
arms
of
some
fifty
human
beings
—
but
a
moment
before
in
all
the
vigor
and
passion
of
life
—
were
now
hissing
and
whizzing
through
the
air
,
in
every
direction
,
while
shrieks
and
groans
were
heard
,
of
the
most
agonizing
description
.
<EOS>
To
add
to
the
awful
spectacle
,
the
boat
immediately
took
fire
,
and
lay
perfectly
unmanageable
—
floating
down
with
the
current
—
while
some
few
,
who
had
escaped
the
explosion
,
could
be
seen
running
to
and
fro
,
calling
for
help
,
or
plunging
into
the
watery
element
,
and
thus
avoiding
one
terrible
death
only
to
meet
with
another
.
<EOS>
The
light
from
the
burning
wreck
now
gleamed
across
the
dark
,
rolling
waters
of
the
Mississippi
,
upon
the
banks
and
trees
,
with
a
sickly
effect
—
displaying
the
outlines
of
a
hundred
dark
figures
,
on
foot
and
on
horse
,
some
standing
,
some
running
to
the
small
boats
,
and
pushing
out
from
the
shore
,
to
the
assistance
of
their
fellow
creatures
,
while
others
were
lying
scattered
here
and
there
on
the
ground
,
mangled
and
bloody
,
dying
and
dead
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sight
to
be
seen
but
once
;
but
once
seen
,
never
to
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Had
we
time
and
space
,
we
might
call
up
the
picture
to
the
reader
's
eye
far
more
vividly
;
but
it
would
only
be
a
sad
,
heart
rending
,
bloody
picture
—
and
'
twere
better
that
it
pass
.
<EOS>
"So
,
"
said
Ronald
,
musingly
,
gazing
upon
the
scene
,
with
a
melancholy
air
:
"
<EOS>
So
,
then
;
in
attempting
our
destruction
,
they
have
sent
themselves
to
eternity
.
<EOS>
Well
,
one
God
sees
all
—
overrules
all
<EOS>
—
orders
all
—
at
least
my
mother
taught
me
so
when
a
child
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
I
were
a
child
again
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
and
turned
his
head
away
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
started
,
and
the
whole
aspect
of
his
features
changed
,
from
the
sad
and
mild
,
to
the
fierce
and
terrible
.
"
<EOS>
Look
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
rising
in
his
stirrups
,
and
grasping
the
arm
of
Piketon
,
who
was
sitting
his
horse
along
side
him
.
<EOS>
—
"
Look
!
<EOS>
Piketon
—
look
!
<EOS>
comrades
—
yonder
,
yonder
!
<EOS>
Gods
!
<EOS>
do
you
see
nothing?""I
see
nothing
but
men
on
horseback
,
quietly
gazing
on
the
burning
vessel
,
"
answered
Piketon
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
one
of
those
—
a
tall
figure
—
a
little
separated
from
the
rest
—
is
the
accursed
traitor
,
John
Webber
!
"
<EOS>
hissed
Ronald
,
rapidly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
does
not
see
us
,
and
thinks
,
doubtless
,
with
the
others
,
that
we
are
all
taken
,
killed
,
or
fled
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
remark
here
,
that
Ronald
and
his
men
were
now
occupying
a
position
on
the
hill
--
in
a
thicket
—
where
they
could
observe
all
that
was
taking
place
below
,
and
remain
themselves
concealed
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
comrades
,
"
continued
Bonardi
,
"
for
one
more
act
ere
we
die
.
<EOS>
Draw
your
knives
,
men
,
and
swear
by
the
mangled
corses
of
your
dead
comrades
,
that
unto
death
you
will
follow
yon
traitor
,
so
long
as
a
man
of
you
remain
alive!""We
swear
!
"
cried
all
,
vehemently
,
touching
the
blades
of
their
knives
to
their
lips
.
"Enough
!
<EOS>
Now
,
Piketon
,
to
cut
him
off
,
ere
he
joins
the
main
body
.
<EOS>
You
,
with
six
men
,
will
defile
carefully
down
on
this
side
;
but
slowly
,
so
as
not
to
attract
attention
.
<EOS>
I
,
with
the
rest
,
will
ride
around
and
suddenly
come
in
before
him
,
when
,
to
save
his
life
,
he
will
be
forced
to
turn
and
fly
.
<EOS>
—
If
he
do
so
,
follow
;
and
Heaven
save
him
if
he
escape
us!"In
a
moment
the
party
of
Bonardi
was
in
motion
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
more
,
his
manoeuvre
was
successfully
executed
;
and
John
—
who
supposed
Bonardi
either
killed
or
taken
,
and
was
now
quietly
gazing
upon
the
awful
sight
on
the
river
—
suddenly
found
himself
confronted
by
the
only
man
he
feared
,
and
cut
off
by
his
followers
from
joining
those
who
might
render
him
assistance
.
<EOS>
—
His
only
safety
was
now
in
flight
;
and
with
a
yell
of
despair
,
he
turned
and
fled
.
<EOS>
That
yell
was
echoed
by
some
fifteen
sturdy
horsemen
,
who
immediately
joined
in
pursuit
,
all
eager
for
his
heart
's
blood
.
<EOS>
The
cries
of
John
,
and
his
pursuers
,
were
heard
far
around
—
ringing
out
upon
the
night
air
like
those
of
so
many
fiends
;
but
they
were
quickly
drowned
by
still
louder
shouts
of
,
"
The
bandits
,
the
bandits!—Bonardi
,
Bonardi
!
"
and
suddenly
wheeling
their
animals
,
some
twenty
horsemen
dashed
madly
forward
,
to
join
in
the
wild
chase
.
<EOS>
Ere
we
follow
them
,
however
,
let
us
briefly
glance
at
the
causes
which
led
to
these
results
,
take
one
more
look
at
the
scene
before
us
,
and
then
close
it
forever
.
<EOS>
After
the
escape
of
John
,
from
Piketon
and
his
companions
—
as
related
in
the
chapter
preceding
—
he
had
ridden
directly
for
home
,
with
dark
thoughts
of
revenge
uppermost
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
knew
if
taken
,
death
would
assuredly
follow
,
as
he
had
that
evening
had
ample
witness
in
the
case
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
His
only
safety
he
now
felt
was
in
the
total
overthrow
of
Bonardi
and
the
banditti
;
and
to
effect
this
as
soon
as
possible
,
was
his
only
theme
,
as
he
spurred
rapidly
on
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
he
would
not
only
secure
his
own
life
,
but
obtain
the
revenge
he
sought
on
those
who
had
dared
to
come
between
him
and
his
victim
.
<EOS>
But
how
to
effect
this
suddenly
,
was
the
main
object
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
thought
of
seeking
his
father
,
and
acquainting
him
of
the
whereabouts
of
Emily
,
and
the
rendezvous
of
the
bandits
—
stating
that
she
had
been
seized
,
carried
off
,
and
was
now
held
in
durance
by
them
.
<EOS>
This
he
knew
would
rouse
the
ire
of
his
father
—
who
was
as
yet
ignorant
of
Bonardi
being
in
the
vicinity
—
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
,
he
would
raise
a
large
company
from
the
surrounding
country
,
go
forth
to
rescue
Emily
,
and
exterminate
the
band
.
<EOS>
But
this
,
even
at
the
best
,
would
consume
much
time
,
and
doubtless
prove
of
no
avail
;
from
the
fact
that
most
of
the
bandits
themselves
were
known
as
settlers
,
and
so
scattered
through
the
country
,
that
the
least
stir
of
this
kind
would
be
known
to
them
in
season
to
effect
an
escape
,
or
,
what
was
more
probable
,
rally
themselves
into
a
body
,
ambush
,
and
slaughter
their
opponents
.
<EOS>
This
project
,
therefore
,
was
a
hazardous
one
;
the
more
so
,
as
in
the
meantime
they
might
seek
him
out
and
kill
him
;
and
he
knew
sufficient
of
Ronald
Bonardi
,
to
render
this
thought
a
not
improbable
,
and
,
consequently
,
a
startling
one
.
<EOS>
They
might
even
now
be
on
his
trail
—
such
a
thing
was
not
unlikely
—
and
he
urged
his
beast
up
hill
and
down
,
over
hollow
and
plain
,
through
forest
,
thicket
and
stream
,
at
his
greatest
speed
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
found
,
to
his
regret
and
consternation
,
that
the
noble
animal
was
beginning
to
falter
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
course
—
his
place
must
be
supplied
by
another
;
and
in
this
,
chance
favored
him
;
for
shortly
after
,
he
rode
past
a
cottage
,
where
he
perceived
several
horses
lying
down
.
<EOS>
Immediately
reining
in
,
he
alighted
,
selected
the
best
,
transferred
bridle
and
saddle
,
and
,
in
less
than
five
minutes
,
was
again
speeding
on
,
leaving
his
own
horse
behind
him
.
<EOS>
When
the
sun
rose
,
he
was
within
twenty
miles
of
his
father
's
cottage
;
and
for
the
first
time
he
slackened
his
speed
,
to
meditate
upon
the
wisest
course
for
him
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
A
thought
struck
him
!
<EOS>
He
would
ride
at
once
to
St.
Louis
,
learn
at
what
time
the
steamer
was
to
leave
,
and
possibly
he
might
hear
of
something
advantageous
to
his
foul
design
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
home
,
some
two
hours
later
,
he
found
that
the
party
—
consisting
of
his
father
,
Merton
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
—
had
just
started
on
a
third
day
's
search
for
Emily
,
and
that
Rufus
was
lying
in
a
very
critical
state
.
<EOS>
This
latter
,
however
,
troubled
him
not
;
and
without
heeding
anything
further
,
he
changed
his
horse
,
and
immediately
set
off
for
St.
Louis
,
where
he
arrived
about
two
o'clock
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
He
knew
from
Bonardi
's
plan
,
that
three
of
the
band
were
to
be
on
board
when
the
boat
should
leave
;
and
accordingly
he
at
once
repaired
hither
,
to
learn
if
anything
new
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Two
of
them
he
found
without
difficulty
,
and
learned
,
to
his
surprise
and
joy
,
that
the
boat
was
to
leave
that
evening
;
that
the
third
had
been
gone
some
thirty
-
six
hours
to
inform
Bonardi
of
the
fact
;
and
that
it
was
supposed
the
latter
would
get
the
information
in
time
,
by
hard
riding
,
to
be
at
the
general
rendezvous
,
where
the
boat
,
owing
to
some
slight
delays
,
would
probably
pass
at
early
dark
.
<EOS>
Than
this
information
,
nothing
could
have
suited
John
's
purpose
better
;
and
he
immediately
hastened
to
a
magistrate
informed
him
of
the
whole
affair
,
and
,
to
give
it
an
air
of
truth
,
stated
that
he
himself
was
a
member
of
the
band
,
whose
conscience
had
forced
him
to
betray
the
wicked
course
his
fraternity
were
pursuing
.
<EOS>
This
information
of
course
was
of
the
most
startling
character
to
the
magistrate
—
who
believed
Bonardi
and
his
men
had
quitted
the
country
some
three
years
before
—
and
instantly
making
out
warrants
,
he
sent
off
and
had
the
two
men
on
the
boat
arrested
.
<EOS>
On
confronting
them
with
John
,
one
of
them
became
much
alarmed
,
and
,
on
the
promise
of
a
pardon
,
immediately
corroborated
his
statement
.
<EOS>
—
The
affair
resulted
in
the
whole
matter
being
speedily
made
known
to
the
governor
,
who
promptly
ordered
two
companies
of
militia
,
consisting
of
over
a
hundred
men
,
several
of
whom
had
served
in
the
late
war
,
to
act
as
a
posse
to
the
Sheriff
,
in
arresting
or
exterminating
the
outlaws
.
<EOS>
The
Sheriff
himself
was
a
man
of
extreme
measures
,
who
cared
little
for
the
sacrifice
of
life
,
so
his
ends
were
by
such
means
accomplished
.
<EOS>
His
plan
was
,
to
have
the
boat
start
at
the
given
time
,
as
though
nothing
had
been
discovered
,
and
,
with
his
posse
,
to
go
down
on
her
himself
;
that
ere
fully
in
sight
of
the
rendezvous
,
some
seventy
-
five
should
land
,
and
proceed
thence
on
foot
;
that
the
steamer
,
when
hailed
,
should
round
to
,
but
manage
to
avoid
sending
out
a
boat
—
<EOS>
well
judging
,
if
the
banditti
were
there
concealed
,
they
would
not
allow
their
scheme
to
be
frustrated
by
a
circumstance
so
trifling,—that
the
steam
should
be
compressed
until
the
boats
came
along
side
,
so
that
the
steamer
might
start
suddenly
,
and
by
this
means
throw
them
into
confusion
;
that
at
the
same
time
the
party
concealed
on
board
,
should
pour
among
them
a
well
directed
fire
,
which
was
also
to
be
a
signal
to
those
on
shore
to
be
ready
to
intercept
their
landing
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
attack
was
carried
out
exactly
as
planned
,
and
the
reader
has
already
seen
the
result
.
<EOS>
The
grand
oversight
was
in
compressing
the
steam
,
and
then
throwing
it
suddenly
upon
the
engine
,
which
shortly
after
produced
the
terrible
explosion
we
have
recorded
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
briefly
explained
the
matters
most
directly
connected
with
our
story
,
and
trusting
the
reader
is
as
anxious
to
quit
this
scene
of
wholesale
slaughter
as
ourself
,
we
shall
,
after
giving
a
slight
summary
of
what
followed
,
leave
it
at
once
and
forever
.
<EOS>
But
few
of
those
poor
beings
on
board
the
ill
fated
steamer
at
the
time
of
her
explosion
,
were
saved
;
and
these
mostly
by
the
aid
of
the
boats
,
which
had
been
brought
hither
by
the
orders
of
Bonardi
,
for
a
very
different
purpose
.
<EOS>
Some
two
or
three
of
the
number
who
leaped
into
the
stream
,
swam
to
the
shore
—
the
rest
were
drowned
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
an
hour
,
the
boat
burned
to
the
water
's
edge
and
sunk
--
bearing
down
with
her
the
gold
and
silver
coin
,
the
primary
cause
of
the
dire
mishap
and
loss
of
life
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
a
messenger
was
despatched
,
post
haste
,
to
St.
Louis
;
which
resulted
in
the
arrival
,
some
three
hours
later
,
of
another
steamer
.
<EOS>
This
,
ere
morning
,
bore
back
a
strange
medley
of
citizens
,
soldiers
,
and
bandits
;
some
well
,
some
wounded
,
some
dying
,
some
dead
.
<EOS>
Of
the
party
of
Bonardi
,
some
few
were
taken
prisoners
;
but
these
,
generally
speaking
,
consisted
of
those
who
were
too
severely
wounded
to
fight
or
escape
,
and
who
afterwards
,
with
but
few
exceptions
,
died
of
their
wounds
—
the
main
body
having
either
fled
or
been
killed
.
<EOS>
Of
the
soldiers
,
a
number
were
killed
in
the
fight
,
and
many
wounded
.
<EOS>
The
prisoners
who
survived
their
injuries
,
together
with
some
three
or
four
others
,
captured
unharmed
,
were
afterwards
tried
by
the
authorities
,
and
disposed
of
according
to
the
evidence
found
against
them
.
<EOS>
On
that
same
night
,
a
steamer
,
chartered
for
the
purpose
,
having
on
board
a
large
body
of
armed
men
,
and
two
six
-
pound
cannon
,
departed
for
the
Osage
;
the
object
of
the
expedition
being
to
find
the
grand
rendezvous
of
the
banditti
,
arrest
or
exterminate
the
remainder
of
the
band
,
and
,
particularly
to
secure
,
living
or
dead
,
the
body
of
Ronald
Bonardi
.

CHAPTER
III.THE
RETURN
—
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
INVALID
—
<EOS>
THE
ALARM
—
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
TRAITOR
—
THE
FIGHT
AND
FLIGHT
—
THE
RALLY
<EOS>
AND
EXPEDITION.An
hour
later
than
that
in
which
the
attack
was
made
on
the
bandits
,
through
the
treachery
of
John
,
the
party
of
his
father
returned
from
a
third
days
search
for
Emily
,
fatigued
in
body
and
depressed
in
spirits
.
<EOS>
Three
days
had
they
traversed
the
country
in
every
direction
,
making
diligent
enquiries
of
every
person
they
met
,
and
yet
,
of
what
had
become
of
her
,
not
the
slightest
cue
had
they
gained
;
and
consequently
,
as
we
have
said
,
they
returned
most
sadly
depressed
in
spirits
,
and
worn
out
in
body
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
hope
of
ever
beholding
her
again
had
almost
become
extinct
;
for
to
them
it
was
probable
<EOS>
she
had
been
seized
by
the
Jew
and
his
accomplices
,
and
taken
out
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
And
this
latter
seemed
the
more
probable
,
from
their
having
been
at
the
residence
of
the
Jew
,
on
the
day
she
disappeared
,
and
knew
him
to
have
been
absent
.
<EOS>
On
Webber
and
Merton
the
sad
truth
fell
with
a
crushing
effect
;
and
men
though
they
were
,
both
wept
for
grief
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
latter
,
when
he
found
all
search
had
been
in
vain
,
knew
it
would
have
to
be
relinquished
,
and
felt
the
sweet
being
of
his
soul
's
adoration
—
she
whose
heart
and
hand
in
the
holy
confidence
of
love
,
had
been
pledged
to
him
—
was
now
gone
,
forever
gone
,
pressed
his
hands
to
his
burning
temples
,
and
strove
,
as
a
man
,
but
vainly
strove
to
be
calm
.
<EOS>
Life
to
him
now
seemed
a
lonely
path
,
through
a
barren
waste
,
where
not
one
bright
flower
by
the
wayside
grew
,
to
relieve
it
of
utter
desolation
;
where
no
ray
of
sunlight
came
,
to
dispel
,
even
for
a
moment
,
the
oppressive
gloom
.
<EOS>
Slowly
,
sadly
,
and
in
silence
,
the
party
referred
to
,
reined
in
their
horses
on
the
night
in
question
,
at
the
cottage
of
Webber
—
<EOS>
litttle
dreaming
that
beneath
that
humble
roof
,
the
ingrate
,
the
black
hearted
villain
,
the
cause
of
their
present
trouble
,
had
been
sheltered
,
and
fed
;
and
that
there
too
,
their
sorrow
was
soon
to
find
an
additional
weight
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
they
were
met
by
Mrs.
Webber
,
who
was
pale
and
trembling
with
intense
grief
and
excitement
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
you
have
come
—
you
have
come
,
thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
uttered
she
,
in
the
low
,
rapid
accents
of
heart
touching
misery
.
<EOS>
"
I
feared
,
oh
God
!
<EOS>
I
feared
you
would
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
quick!""Sarah
,
Sarah
,
"
gasped
Webber
,
"
what
,
what
has
happened
?
<EOS>
Speak
,
Sarah
!
<EOS>
for
Heaven
-
sake
speak!""Alas
!
<EOS>
William
,
Rufus
—
"
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Sarah!""Is
dying
.
<EOS>
""Great
Heaven
!
"
and
staggering
back
,
Webber
would
have
fallen
,
had
not
the
arms
of
Bernard
,
who
was
close
behind
,
supported
him
.
<EOS>
Like
the
sudden
shock
of
an
earthquake
,
this
startling
announcement
came
upon
those
who
heard
it
;
for
they
believed
Rufus
free
of
danger
,
and
slowly
,
yet
gradually
recovering
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
pronounced
convalescent
by
his
physician
,
and
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
had
so
engrossed
their
attention
,
that
by
them
he
had
in
a
measure
been
forgotten
.
<EOS>
From
the
moment
of
his
fainting
,
on
hearing
of
the
disappearance
of
Emily
,
as
previously
mentioned
,
he
had
gradually
declined
.
<EOS>
His
mother
—
whose
very
existence
,
as
we
have
before
stated
,
seemed
bound
up
in
his
—
noticed
the
change
,
with
all
a
fond
mother
's
feelings
of
grief
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
Night
and
day
since
,
had
she
remained
almost
constantly
by
his
side
;
and
on
the
evening
previous
,
<EOS>
when
the
party
returned
,
she
had
made
known
to
her
husband
her
fears
.
<EOS>
Wearied
by
a
hard
day
's
ride
,
and
thinking
her
fears
had
made
her
exaggerate
,
Webber
,
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
,
had
seemed
almost
indifferent
to
his
wife
's
remarks
;
and
merely
saying
,
"
He
will
be
better
anon
,
"
retired
early
to
rest
,
to
be
in
readiness
to
pursue
his
search
for
Emily
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
Several
times
during
the
day
on
which
we
have
again
introduced
him
,
his
conscience
had
reproved
him
for
neglecting
his
son
;
and
it
was
not
without
considerable
anxiety
,
that
he
once
more
approached
home
;
<EOS>
consequently
the
powerful
effect
produced
by
the
sudden
and
alarming
announcement
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Recovering
,
somewhat
,
from
the
first
terrible
shock
,
Webber
sprang
forward
,
and
in
a
moment
stood
by
his
son
,
followed
by
his
wife
,
Merton
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
A
light
,
standing
on
the
table
by
the
bed
,
cast
a
mournful
gleam
—
if
we
may
so
be
allowed
the
expression
—
on
to
the
pale
,
calm
features
of
the
dying
youth
,
who
,
save
an
unnatural
breathing
,
seemed
like
one
asleep
.
"Rufus
!
<EOS>
"
gasped
his
father
,
grasping
his
thin
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Rufus
,
my
son!"Slowly
the
invalid
unclosed
his
eyes
,
and
for
a
moment
looked
up
with
a
vacant
stare
.
<EOS>
"Rufus
,
my
son
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
do
you
not
know
me?""Father
,
"
said
Rufus
,
calmly
,
a
look
of
recognition
lighting
up
his
thin
features
,
at
the
same
time
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
,
and
glancing
slowly
around
:
"
Father
—
mother
—
Edward
—
yes
,
yes
,
I
know
you
all
;
but
I
am
weak
,
father
,
"
and
he
sunk
back
on
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
started
,
and
a
bright
flush
passed
over
his
wan
features
.
<EOS>
"
Emily
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
quickly
:
"
Emily
!
<EOS>
what
of
her
?
<EOS>
have
you
found
her
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
gazed
with
an
intense
look
on
his
father
's
tearful
eye
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
my
son
,
we
have
not
.
<EOS>
""Too
<EOS>
well
—
<EOS>
too
well
I
knew
it
,
"
he
murmured
,
clasping
his
hands
,
and
gazing
upward
with
a
solemn
,
devout
look
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
meet
again
,
but
it
will
be
there
;
"
and
stretching
forth
his
wasted
,
bony
arm
<EOS>
,
he
pointed
above
:
"
It
will
be
there
—
in
Heaven!""Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
Rufus
,
"
cried
his
mother
,
springing
forward
,
unable
to
control
herself
longer
,
and
bending
on
him
a
look
of
the
most
intense
anguish
,
while
every
eye
in
the
room
filled
with
water
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
Rufus
,
say
you
will
meet
again
on
earth!"Rufus
gazed
upon
her
a
moment
,
and
shook
his
head
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
dear
mother
,
speak
not
thus
!
<EOS>
My
minutes
are
all
numbered
.
<EOS>
I
—
I
am
dying
,
mother
.
<EOS>
""Oh
God
,
support
me
!
"
<EOS>
returned
she
,
sinking
into
a
chair
,
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
mother
—
nay
,
father
—
nay
,
friends
"
—
continued
he
,
"
weep
not
!
<EOS>
We
must
all
die
,
sooner
or
later
,
and
death
is
only
terrible
when
we
are
not
prepared
to
meet
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
parting
for
a
time
,
to
meet
again
in
the
bright
and
glorious
land
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
I
feel
I
shall
be
happy
when
my
spirit
has
thrown
off
this
clayey
tenement
,
and
entered
upon
its
second
existence
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
dear
parents
and
friends
,
I
beseech
you
,
weep
not
for
me
!
<EOS>
for
I
was
not
,
could
not
be
happy
here
.
<EOS>
Edward
,
come
hither
;
I
have
somewhat
to
say
to
you
,
ere
<EOS>
I
set
out
upon
my
long
journey
.
"Edward
<EOS>
approached
with
tearful
eyes
,
and
took
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"You
,
<EOS>
my
noble
friend
,
"
continued
Rufus
,
"
are
sad
—
almost
heart
-
broken
—
for
the
sweet
being
you
love
is
gone
;
but
be
not
cast
down
—
be
not
disheartened
—
for
you
will
meet
again
,
and
see
many
happy
days
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
shake
not
your
head
with
that
despairing
look
,
for
what
I
tell
you
is
true
.
<EOS>
My
spirit
is
already
on
the
verge
of
eternity
,
and
looks
with
a
prophetic
eye
into
the
future
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
had
a
dream
;
and
in
that
dream
I
saw
you
and
Emily
meet
.
<EOS>
There
was
sadness
in
the
hearts
of
both
;
but
it
gradually
rolled
away
,
as
mist
from
the
mountain
tops
,
and
joy
,
like
sunlight
,
shone
in
your
faces
.
<EOS>
Mark
these
words
!
<EOS>
they
are
prophetic
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
her
,
you
will
love
her
,
you
will
cherish
and
guard
her
,
with
all
the
pure
,
deep
devotion
of
a
holy
love
,
emanating
from
a
high
minded
,
noble
,
manly
heart
.
<EOS>
Ere
that
time
,
however
,
these
frail
limbs
will
have
stiffened
in
death
—
this
soul
will
have
flown
to
the
presence
of
its
God
;
therefore
shall
I
give
you
my
secret
,
and
request
that
you
bear
to
her
my
dying
words
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
,
Edward
,
that
one
who
is
gone
,
loved
her
no
less
deeply
,
no
less
purely
,
no
less
sacredly
than
yourself
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
that
from
youth
up
she
was
the
sole
ideal
of
his
longings
,
the
angel
visitant
of
his
dreams
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
that
Hope
,
like
a
star
,
once
rose
and
shone
brightly
on
the
broad
field
of
his
future
imaginings
,
but
that
its
light
went
out
in
the
Hope
of
another
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
to
think
sometimes
on
this
,
and
sometimes
cast
a
glance
upon
the
lowly
grave
of
Rufus
Webber
.
<EOS>
You
will
tell
her
this
,
Edward?""Should
<EOS>
we
meet
again
,
my
gentle
friend
,
I
will
,
"
replied
Edward
,
pressing
the
hand
of
Rufus
.
<EOS>
"You
will
meet
again
,
Edward
,
and
in
that
thought
I
die
happy
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
loved
her
so
,
"
said
Edward
,
deeply
affected
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
knew
it
not
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
she
knew
it
not
,
"
returned
Rufus
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
she
loved
another
,
and
I
would
not
pain
her
with
the
story
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
now
past
,
and
so
forget
it
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
feel
my
voice
is
going
:
I
feel
myself
growing
fainter
;
and
so
,
dear
Edward
,
farewell!"Edward
pressed
his
hand
,
and
turned
away
with
a
burst
of
grief
.
<EOS>
"Father?""My
son!""I
am
going
fast
.
<EOS>
Where
is
John?""Alas
!
<EOS>
he
is
not
here
.
<EOS>
""Then
bid
him
farewell
for
me
,
and
tell
him
it
was
the
dying
request
of
his
brother
,
that
he
shun
bad
company
.
<EOS>
Father
,
farewell
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
pressed
his
hand
—
a
hand
that
shook
with
the
agonies
of
a
father
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mother
,
"
and
the
voice
of
Rufus
faltered
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
my
child
—
my
son
—
my
own
dear
Rufus
!
"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
,
and
pressing
kiss
after
kiss
upon
his
bloodless
,
quivering
lips
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
son
—
my
son
—
I
can
not
,
can
not
part
with
you!""Mother
,
dear
mother
,
"
returned
he
,
in
faltering
accents
:
"
<EOS>
Mother
,
be
calm
—
be
calm
!
<EOS>
Remember
it
is
the
will
of
God
,
who
orders
all
things
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
meet
again
in
another
,
in
a
better
world
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
death
is
coming
.
<EOS>
Mother
,
fare
—
<EOS>
fare
-
well
!
<EOS>
Friends
—
all
—
all
—
fare
—
farewell
!
<EOS>
In
—
in
Heaven
!
"
and
with
these
words
the
lips
of
the
gentle
Rufus
were
sealed
forever
.
<EOS>
For
an
hour
life
remained
in
his
body
;
but
from
that
moment
Rufus
spoke
no
more
,
nor
seemed
he
conscious
of
anything
that
transpired
afterward
,
although
his
mother
still
clung
to
,
and
entreated
him
in
the
most
heart
-
rending
tones
to
speak
to
her
again
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
the
time
mentioned
,
his
gentle
spirit
passed
away
,
as
one
sinking
into
a
quiet
sleep
.
<EOS>
His
mother
,
when
fully
convinced
that
he
was
gone
—
that
in
sad
truth
his
dearly
loved
voice
she
would
never
hear
again
—
slowly
unclasped
her
arms
from
his
neck
,
and
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
steadfastly
upon
him
,
sank
into
a
seat
by
his
side
,
seemingly
unconscious
of
everything
around
.
<EOS>
His
father
stood
and
gazed
upon
him
for
a
few
moments
with
folded
arms
,
while
his
features
writhed
in
agony
,
his
chest
heaved
,
and
his
heart
beat
fast
and
almost
audibly
.
<EOS>
In
silence
,
in
sorrow
,
stood
Merton
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
,
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
gazing
upon
the
corpse
—
forming
a
most
impressive
group
for
a
mournful
picture
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
each
started
,
and
gazed
into
each
others
faces
enquiringly
.
<EOS>
A
shrill
cry
came
borne
upon
the
air
,
and
with
it
a
sound
like
the
rushing
of
waters
.
<EOS>
Another
,
and
another
cry
,
and
nearer
and
louder
came
the
rushing
sound
.
<EOS>
What
could
it
mean
?
<EOS>
All
sprang
to
the
door
;
and
although
it
was
dark
,
yet
dashing
over
the
hill
to
the
right
,
they
could
trace
the
dim
outline
of
a
horseman
;
and
,
following
close
,
another
—
another
—
and
still
,
and
still
another
—
and
more
behind
.
<EOS>
"There
must
be
something
alarming
!
"
said
Webber
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
it
mean?"Scarcely
were
the
words
uttered
,
ere
the
foremost
horseman
dashed
up
to
the
door
,
leaped
from
his
steed
,
and
rushed
in
in
breathless
haste
.
<EOS>
"John
!
"
cried
Webber
,
in
astonishment
.
"Quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
<EOS>
father
—
close
the
door
—
or
I
shall
be
murdered
!
<EOS>
I
am
pursued
by
Ronald
Bonardi
and
his
men!""Ronald
Bonardi
!
"
<EOS>
echoed
all
,
in
a
breath
;
and
springing
back
,
<EOS>
the
door
was
bolted
just
as
the
other
horsemen
were
beginning
to
come
up
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
Ronald
Bonardi
,
"
answered
John
,
rapidly
.
"
<EOS>
He
and
his
band
are
the
kidnappers
of
Emiily
.
<EOS>
I
know
their
secret
retreat
,
and
for
this
they
would
murder
me!""Emily
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Merton
,
breathlessly
,
"
Emily
!
<EOS>
speak
—
speak!—where
is
she?""In
Bonardi
's
cave
,
on
the
Osage
river
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
John
,
you
give
me
new
life!""Then
use
it
defending
mine
,
by
killing
these
ruffians
,
and
I
will
restore
her
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
<EOS>
"
said
a
deep
voice
from
without
,
"
for
our
time
is
most
precious
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
next
moment
there
came
a
tremendous
crash
,
making
the
whole
house
tremble
—
the
door
,
bolts
,
bars
and
all
,
were
splintered
and
broken
into
a
hundred
pieces
—
while
a
tall
,
muscular
figure
leaped
forward
,
into
the
centre
of
the
astonished
group
,
and
the
same
deep
voice
shouted:"Ho
,
traitor!""'Tis
he
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
John
,
turning
to
fly
.
<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
,
'
tis
he
!
"
shouted
back
the
figure
;
and
then
there
came
a
flash
—
a
crack
—
and
with
a
yell
of
pain
John
sank
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"How!—Barton
!
<EOS>
"
gasped
Webber
,
in
astonishment
,
as
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
intruder
's
features
.
<EOS>
"Barton
<EOS>
and
Bonardi
are
one!"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
the
figure
seized
upon
the
body
of
John
,
with
the
strength
of
a
giant
,
and
,
turning
,
bounded
into
the
midst
of
his
followers
,
who
stood
crowded
around
the
doorway
to
cover
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
"To
horse
!
<EOS>
to
horse
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
;
and
darting
away
at
the
word
,
in
a
moment
more
each
man
was
in
his
saddle
.
<EOS>
So
rapidly
was
this
whole
movement
executed
—
for
it
occupied
far
less
time
in
action
,
than
we
have
in
description
—
that
neither
Webber
himself
,
Merton
,
Bernard
nor
Tyrone
,
recovered
from
the
torpor
of
a
sudden
astonishment
,
ere
the
bandits
had
escaped
them
—
actually
shooting
,
seizing
,
and
bearing
John
from
their
midst
.
<EOS>
"Good
God
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Webber
,
"
is
my
house
to
be
broken
into
,
my
son
murdered
and
borne
away
,
without
a
hand
being
raised
to
rescue
or
avenge
him
?
<EOS>
Follow
,
men
!
"
and
rushing
forth
,
he
was
quickly
joined
by
his
three
companions
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
bandits
were
all
mounted
,
and
Bonardi
,
still
supporting
John
,
was
just
balancing
himself
in
his
saddle
,
when
he
observed
Webber
rushing
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"Away
<EOS>
!
"
he
shouted
to
his
men
;
and
burying
his
own
spurs
in
his
horse
's
flanks
,
he
darted
off
.
<EOS>
Webber
instantly
drew
a
pistol
,
and
taking
aim
as
well
as
the
darkness
would
permit
,
pulled
the
trigger
.
<EOS>
A
flash
—
a
report
—
a
groan
succeeded
—
and
he
could
perceive
Bonardi
waver
in
his
saddle
;
but
still
he
sat
his
horse
—
the
animal
slackened
not
his
speed
—
and
in
a
few
seconds
both
horse
and
rider
disappeared
,
while
Webber
's
attention
was
suddenly
called
to
another
quarter
,
where
the
bandits
were
being
attacked
by
another
party
of
horsemen
that
had
just
come
up
.
<EOS>
From
the
flight
of
John
from
the
river
,
the
chase
had
been
a
desperate
,
and
an
equal
one
;
with
the
exception
,
that
in
the
hard
run
of
thirty
miles
,
the
bandits
had
succeeded
in
distancing
their
pursuers
some
quarter
of
a
mile
,
so
that
they
had
just
sufficient
time
,
after
John
entered
the
cottage
,
to
seize
upon
a
huge
stick
of
timber
,
break
open
the
door
,
capture
the
traitor
and
mount
,
before
the
others
were
upon
them
.
<EOS>
As
their
design
was
now
accomplished
,
they
turned
upon
their
pursuers
,
headed
by
Piketon
—
for
Bonardi
still
kept
upon
his
course
—
and
a
terrible
fight
ensued
.
<EOS>
Webber
and
his
companions
not
knowing
friend
from
foe
,
retreated
into
the
house
,
to
be
ready
to
defend
it
in
case
of
necessity
.
<EOS>
"I
guess
they
're
having
a
putty
hard
tussle
,
by
the
way
them
are
shooting
irons
are
going
off
,
"
remarked
Bernard
.
"
<EOS>
Had
n't
we
better
assist
them
are
fellers
that
come
up
last
,
eh
,
Bill?""Gladly
,
if
we
could
assist
them
;
but
to
attempt
it
now
would
be
fool
-
hardy
,
"
answered
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
this
fight
is
over
,
we
must
rally
as
large
a
company
as
possible
,
and
start
immediately
for
the
Osage
,
to
rescue
Emily
,
and
punish
the
murderers
of
my
son
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
am
I
to
be
made
childless
in
one
night
!
"
<EOS>
and
Webber
leaned
against
the
wall
of
his
cottage
for
support
.
"
<EOS>
And
to
think
,
too
,
"
continued
he
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
how
basely
I
have
been
deceived
!
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
realize
my
having
been
,
more
or
less
,
for
three
years
past
,
the
companion
of
that
notorious
bandit
,
Ronald
Bonardi
,
under
the
assumed
name
of
Barton!""Wal
,
when
I
seed
him
at
the
river
,
and
you
was
a
talking
to
him
about
himself
,
I
guessed
then
his
name
was
n't
Barton
,
"
said
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
he
shall
not
escape
again
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Webber
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
brought
to
justice
,
unless
he
die
defending
himself
;
for
I
will
follow
him
to
the
world
's
end
myself
,
sooner
than
suffer
him
to
go
unpunished
.
<EOS>
Fool
that
I
was
,
to
let
him
shoot
down
my
son
before
my
own
eyes
!
<EOS>
And
then
to
actually
bear
him
off
!
<EOS>
What
unheard
of
daring!""The
whole
affair
transpired
so
suddenly
,
"
remarked
Tyrone
,
"
that
for
one
I
really
knew
not
what
was
taking
place
,
until
he
had
fled
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
same
with
myself
,
"
said
Edward
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
much
mistaken
,
or
he
suffers
now
;
for
when
Webber
fired
,
I
heard
him
groan
,
and
fancied
I
saw
him
reel
in
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
kind
o
'
thought
as
how
that
are
shot
did
him
too
,
"
rejoined
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
did
n't
,
there
's
more
where
that
come
from
,
I
guess
,
as
will
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
"
rejoined
Webber
,
fiercely
,
"
there
is
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
But
hist
!
<EOS>
The
fighting
seems
to
have
ceased
,
and
there
is
a
horseman
approaching
.
<EOS>
""House
,
ho
!
"
shouted
a
voice
from
without
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
would
you
?
"
answered
Webber
,
interrogatively
.
<EOS>
"Rest
and
food
for
the
night
,
for
our
horses
and
ourselves
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
are
you
?
"
demanded
Webber
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
officer
of
justice
,
at
the
head
of
a
party
of
soldiers
,
sent
out
to
arrest
or
exterminate
these
accursed
bandits
,
who
,
with
the
exception
of
three
killed
,
have
again
escaped
us
.
<EOS>
We
would
tarry
here
until
daylight
,
ere
we
pursue
them
further
;
for
our
horses
are
fatigued
,
two
of
our
men
are
killed
,
and
three
or
four
others
wounded
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
accommodate
us
,
I
will
see
that
you
are
remunerated
,
and
will
also
give
you
the
full
particulars
of
what
has
occurred
.
<EOS>
""I
am
in
a
sad
condition
to
do
so
,
"
answered
Webber
,
gloomily
;
"
for
one
son
lies
a
corpse
in
the
house
,
another
has
just
been
shot
and
borne
away
,
my
wife
sits
buried
in
grief
,
and
I
am
nearly
distracted
myself
;
but
still
,
such
accommodation
as
I
have
<EOS>
,
you
are
most
welcome
to
;
and
we
will
endeavor
,
ere
morning
,
to
increase
your
party
for
the
pursuit
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
further
detail
seems
unnecessary
here
,
we
trust
the
reader
will
allow
us
to
substitute
a
brief
summary
of
what
followed
.
<EOS>
The
party
in
question
remained
at
Webber
's
through
the
night
—
all
resting
,
with
the
exception
of
the
wounded
,
in
the
out
-
houses
.
<EOS>
The
latter
were
cared
for
,
as
well
as
circumstances
would
permit
,
and
their
wounds
not
being
of
a
very
serious
nature
,
they
departed
the
next
morning
for
St.
Louis
,
bearing
their
two
dead
comrades
with
them
.
<EOS>
During
the
night
a
search
was
made
,
in
the
direction
taken
by
Bonardi
,
for
the
body
of
John
;
it
being
thought
probable
,
the
former
,
if
wounded
,
might
drop
him
on
the
way
,
and
possibly
with
life
remaining
--
though
for
the
latter
there
was
little
hope;—but
the
expedition
proved
fruitless
,
and
the
party
returned
some
three
hours
later
,
not
having
discovered
the
least
trace
.
<EOS>
Merton
,
anxious
to
start
early
on
the
morrow
to
the
rescue
of
her
he
loved
,
rode
most
of
the
night
from
farm
to
farm
,
among
the
settlers
,
giving
each
a
brief
account
of
what
had
happened
,
and
beseeching
them
to
join
in
ridding
the
country
of
the
outlaws
;
the
result
of
which
was
,
the
additional
force
of
some
twenty
-
five
,
able
bodied
,
determined
men
,
well
mounted
and
armed
,
who
,
with
the
party
at
Webber
's
,
set
out
at
daylight
on
a
journey
to
the
Osage
,
to
search
for
the
grand
rendezvous
,
apprehend
,
disperse
,
or
annihilate
the
banditti
.
<EOS>
In
this
expedition
,
Webber
and
Tyrone
did
not
join
;
the
former
,
because
he
did
not
consider
it
prudent
to
leave
his
house
in
a
totally
unguarded
state
,
with
the
corpse
of
his
son
within
,
and
his
wife
in
a
very
feeble
condition
,
but
little
better
than
a
stupid
insanity
,
caused
from
her
overwhelming
grief
;
and
the
latter
,
because
it
was
deemed
advisable
that
one
at
least
should
remain
as
a
companion
for
the
former
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Webber
had
learned
,
in
course
of
conversation
with
the
officer
mentioned
,
the
astounding
particulars
of
what
had
occurred
at
the
river
,
and
the
cause
of
hate
against
his
son
,
from
his
having
been
a
member
and
betrayed
the
band
,
the
which
had
served
to
completely
unnerve
,
and
almost
render
him
insane
also
.
<EOS>
Besides
Webber
,
his
wife
and
Tyrone
,
there
was
another
individual
within
that
house
of
mourning
,
whom
we
have
,
during
the
excitement
of
the
past
few
days
,
lost
sight
of
altogether
;
but
whom
we
shall
bring
once
more
before
the
reader
,
ere
<EOS>
we
close
our
now
nearly
completed
story
.
<EOS>
—
We
allude
to
the
prisoner
of
the
Jew
,
who
,
under
the
treatment
he
had
of
late
received
,
was
fast
regaining
health
and
strength
.
<EOS>
But
leaving
each
and
all
for
the
present
,
let
us
precede
the
party
just
departed
,
to
the
cave
on
the
Osage
.

<EOS>
THE
RETURN.On
<EOS>
the
afternoon
of
the
day
succeeding
the
fight
,
and
the
second
from
the
departure
of
Bonardi
,
<EOS>
a
rough
group
of
some
fifteen
outlaws
were
lounging
about
the
Outer
Cave
—
some
talking
,
some
polishing
their
weapons
,
and
some
playing
cards
.
<EOS>
These
consisted
of
the
ten
left
as
guards
,
with
the
addition
of
Hendrick
and
his
four
companions
,
who
returned
the
day
previous
,
bringing
in
Saxton
and
Niles
prisoners
,
both
of
whom
were
now
confined
in
the
dungeon
below
,
the
place
whence
Piketon
led
forth
the
Jew
on
the
night
of
his
trial
and
execution
.
<EOS>
In
the
Inner
Cave
were
four
females
—
consisting
of
Emily
,
Inez
,
Hetty
and
Cyntha
;
and
to
these
we
shall
,
for
the
present
,
direct
our
attention
.
<EOS>
Inez
and
Emily
,
at
the
moment
introduced
,
were
reclining
on
sofas
,
but
a
little
distance
apart
,
while
the
other
two
,
Hetty
and
Cyntha
,
were
occupying
one
corner
of
the
apartment
,
conversing
together
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
Since
the
departure
of
Ronald
,
Inez
had
lavished
upon
Emily
the
most
tender
care
,
anticipating
her
every
wish
,
and
doing
all
in
her
power
to
restore
her
strength
,
and
contribute
to
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
Partly
from
Ronald
,
ere
his
departure
,
and
afterwards
from
Hetty
and
Emily
herself
,
she
had
learned
the
story
of
the
wrongs
of
the
latter
,
and
all
the
gentle
sympathies
of
the
woman
had
been
elicited
in
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
From
Ronald
,
too
,
she
had
learned
a
secret
,
of
which
Emily
and
Hetty
were
as
yet
ignorant
,
accompanied
by
a
request
that
she
would
not
reveal
it
,
unless
some
unforeseen
accident
should
prevent
his
return
.
<EOS>
The
parting
between
Ronald
and
Inez
had
been
affecting
and
solemn
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
revealed
to
Inez
his
design
,
but
she
could
perceive
by
his
pale
features
,
and
an
agitation
which
he
vainly
strove
to
conceal
,
that
he
was
about
setting
forth
on
an
unusual
,
if
not
dangerous
mission
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
as
we
have
said
,
the
parting
had
been
affecting
and
solemn
;
and
since
that
time
,
Inez
,
although
she
strove
to
be
cheerful
,
and
paid
the
most
tender
regards
to
the
wants
of
Emily
,
could
not
banish
from
<EOS>
her
mind
thoughts
dark
and
painful
;
and
in
consequence
an
air
of
gloomy
abstraction
would
not
unfrequently
take
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
we
again
introduce
her
,
these
painful
reveries
had
become
more
frequent
than
before
—
more
prolonged
—
and
in
one
of
them
we
now
find
her
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
had
we
space
to
devote
it
,
we
might
moralize
upon
the
causes
producing
these
results
.
<EOS>
It
is
thought
the
spirit
,
in
many
cases
,
when
approaching
the
confines
of
that
vast
eternity
before
it
,
grows
brighter
,
more
etherial
,
and
is
less
allied
to
the
corporeal
substance
around
it
—
consequently
,
is
more
sensitive
to
events
about
to
happen
--
and
by
its
elevation
or
depression
,
prognosticates
,
many
times
,
the
good
or
evil
that
will
shortly
follow
:
moreover
,
too
,
that
with
an
intuitive
sense
,
it
sometimes
communicates
to
the
body
<EOS>
what
and
whom
this
good
or
evil
will
effect
,
and
what
will
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
Hence
the
spiritual
,
or
second
sight
.
<EOS>
We
believe
,
too
,
the
spirit
is
not
unfrequently
acted
upon
,
when
far
from
death
ourselves
,
with
regard
to
the
fate
of
some
dearly
beloved
friend
,
(
but
not
so
clearly
as
in
the
former
instance
)
which
is
to
influence
our
seeming
destiny
;
and
hence
our
gloomy
forebodings
,
or
presentiments
.
<EOS>
But
as
we
presume
the
reader
—
who
is
doubtless
anxious
for
the
conclusion
of
our
story
—
will
not
thank
us
for
stopping
to
moralize
or
philosophize
here
,
we
shall
pass
on
,
and
leave
a
subject
we
might
otherwise
be
tempted
to
investigate
farther
.
<EOS>
Inez
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
reclining
on
a
sofa
,
in
a
mood
of
gloomy
abstraction
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
ground
,
her
features
were
pale
and
very
sad
in
expression
,
and
there
was
a
slight
quiver
of
some
of
the
delicate
muscles
,
as
though
the
mind
was
laboring
with
painful
thought
.
<EOS>
—
She
had
been
sitting
thus
some
quarter
of
an
hour
,
motionless
and
mute
.
<EOS>
Emily
was
also
reclining
upon
a
sofa
,
but
a
little
distance
from
her
.
<EOS>
Her
features
,
too
,
were
pale
,
and
somewhat
care
-
worn
;
but
there
was
,
notwithstanding
,
a
more
animated
and
hopeful
look
than
when
we
saw
her
last
—
and
yet
,
withal
,
the
expression
was
sad
.
<EOS>
Under
the
kind
treatment
received
from
Inez
,
Emily
had
gradually
recovered
from
the
hardships
she
had
undergone
,
and
although
still
weak
,
was
fast
regaining
health
and
strength
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
introduced
,
her
eyes
were
resting
enquiringly
,
but
sadly
,
upon
Inez
,
as
though
she
sympathized
with
,
and
wished
,
yet
almost
feared
to
question
her
of
her
sorrows
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
strong
promptings
of
her
gentle
and
grateful
heart
got
the
better
of
her
reserve
,
and
approaching
,
she
bent
down
,
and
gently
taking
the
soft
,
delicate
hand
of
Inez
in
her
own
,
in
a
sweet
,
touching
,
musical
voice
,
she
said:"You
are
sad
,
dear
<EOS>
Inez?"There
are
words
,
and
ways
of
saying
them
,
which
at
times
,
with
a
sudden
and
resistless
impulse
,
will
stir
up
all
the
finer
emotions
of
the
heart
,
and
make
the
eye
grow
moist
and
dim
.
<EOS>
—
Such
was
the
effect
of
Emily
's
words
upon
Inez
.
<EOS>
She
started
,
a
flush
mantled
her
pale
features
,
and
she
looked
up
into
the
sweet
countenance
of
Emily
,
with
tearful
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
these
two
gentle
beings
were
locked
in
each
other
's
embrace
,
and
the
tears
of
both
mingled
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
will
you
not
open
your
heart
,
dear
Inez
,
and
tell
me
what
makes
you
so
sorrowful
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Emily
,
as
,
with
an
arm
thrown
around
the
others
waist
,
she
seated
herself
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
"I
hardly
know
myself
,
Emily
,
"
answered
Inez
,
with
a
sigh
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
feel
as
though
there
were
a
weight
upon
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
fear
something
has
happened
to
him
--
to
Ronald
--
though
why
I
can
not
tell
;
for
he
has
often
been
away
,
sometimes
for
a
week
,
and
yet
I
felt
not
so
depressed
as
now
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
dark
man
you
spoke
of
will
betray
him
,
perhaps
has
done
so
already
,
and
he
may
now
be
in
prison
,
or
dead
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
if
such
should
be
the
case
,
what
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
would
become
of
me
?
"
<EOS>
and
Inez
shuddered
,
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
borrow
trouble
,
dear
Inez
,
"
said
Emily
,
gently
,
and
soothingly
.
<EOS>
"
All
will
turn
out
for
the
best
,
rest
assured
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
in
the
hands
of
a
holy
,
omnipresent
God
,
whose
actions
can
not
err
.
<EOS>
""But
is
not
that
God
a
God
of
justice
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Inez
,
solemnly
.
"
<EOS>
And
will
he
not
punish
man
for
his
misdeeds
,
his
—
his
—
"
Inez
'
voice
faltered
—
"
his
crimes?""Man
will
doubtless
suffer
for
his
misdoings
,
"
answered
Emily
;
"
but
God
will
look
into
the
heart
and
judge
him
by
the
motive
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
Emily
,
dear
Emily
,
"
returned
Inez
,
weeping
,
"
to
you
I
will
say
what
I
have
never
yet
said
to
human
being
—
for
you
seem
so
gentle
and
pure
,
my
heart
yearns
for
your
sympathy
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
occupation
of
my
husband
,
and
that
it
is
criminal
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
His
heart
is
good
and
noble
;
and
yet
,
for
his
outward
acts
,
I
have
a
long
time
feared
,
and
of
late
more
than
ever
,
that
some
terrible
calamity
,
sooner
or
later
,
will
befal
him
.
<EOS>
""It
is
strange
,
"
replied
Emily
,
musingly
,
"
that
one
who
possesses
so
many
good
and
generous
qualities
as
he
,
should
lead
such
a
wild
,
daring
life
—
should
associate
with
men
so
far
inferior
to
himself
,
both
in
intellect
and
education
.
<EOS>
""Yet
<EOS>
judge
him
<EOS>
not
too
harshly
,
dear
Emily
,
"
returned
Inez
,
sorrowfully
,
"
for
circumstances
have
made
him
what
he
is
.
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
his
early
history
;
how
he
wept
over
the
death
of
a
beloved
mother
—
a
mother
who
was
foully
,
most
foully
wronged;—how
your
—
how
his
own
father
disowned
,
treated
him
with
contempt
,
and
spurned
him
from
his
presence
,
while
society
could
do
nought
less
than
point
at
him
with
the
finger
of
shame
,
because
he
was
a
bastard
son
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
know
not
how
such
things
can
try
a
proud
,
restless
spirit
like
his
—
a
spirit
that
,
turned
into
a
different
channel
,
had
led
him
to
honor
and
renown
—
and
make
him
turn
with
venomed
tooth
upon
that
society
,
as
the
viper
upon
the
foot
that
tramples
it
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
doubt
not
there
have
been
strong
causes
for
his
deeds
,
"
rejoined
Emily
;
"
yet
methinks
a
nature
like
his
should
have
paused
,
ere
he
brought
one
so
gentle
and
innocent
as
you
seem
to
be
,
into
a
career
the
laws
of
the
land
will
hold
most
criminal
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
him
wrong
there
,
dear
Emily
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
my
own
doing
.
<EOS>
He
frankly
and
nobly
told
me
all
;
that
we
must
never
meet
again
;
and
yet
I
married
him
,
and
gave
up
name
and
wealth
,
knowing
him
to
be
an
outlaw
.
<EOS>
""This
is
strange
,
very
strange
,
Inez
,
"
remarked
Emily
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Does
<EOS>
it
seem
strange
to
you?—to
me
it
is
simple
.
<EOS>
I
loved
him
;
and
had
it
been
to
the
gallows
direct
he
would
have
led
me
,
I
cheerfully
had
gone
to
die
with
him
.
<EOS>
""I
understand
,
"
replied
Emily
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
woman
's
love
!
<EOS>
what
will
it
not
do
?
<EOS>
where
can
its
bounds
be
set
?
<EOS>
But
strange
that
he
did
not
then
,
does
not
now
,
give
up
this
wild
,
terrible
life
,
and
retire
to
some
quiet
,
though
humble
spot
,
where
you
would
both
be
happy
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
"
sighed
Inez
,
"
his
oath
bound
him
then
—
his
oath
binds
him
yet
.
<EOS>
""Alas
,
indeed
!
"
sighed
Emily
;
and
<EOS>
for
some
minutes
both
sat
silent
,
buried
in
thought
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
Inez
started
to
her
feet
,
and
her
but
now
gloomy
countenance
became
radiant
with
joy
.
<EOS>
"He
comes
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
"
he
comes
!
<EOS>
I
hear
his
step
.
<EOS>
I
would
know
it
from
a
million
—
and
now
his
voice
!
"
<EOS>
and
tears
of
joy
streamed
from
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
remark
of
Inez
was
correct
;
for
Ronald
had
already
entered
the
Outer
Cave
,
and
was
now
giving
orders
in
a
low
,
rapid
tone
.
"Quick
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
quick
!
<EOS>
All
—
all
is
lost
.
<EOS>
If
there
are
any
here
afraid
to
die
,
they
may
now
escape
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
be
attacked
.
<EOS>
Those
of
you
who
are
willing
to
stand
the
brunt
of
the
peril
,
will
join
Piketon
,
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
him
at
the
Entrance
.
<EOS>
He
already
has
his
orders
.
<EOS>
You
will
obey
to
the
letter
his
commands
.
<EOS>
Go
,
men
!
<EOS>
I
am
wounded
and
faint
.
<EOS>
Should
we
never
meet
again
,
farewell
!
"
<EOS>
and
Ronald
extended
a
hand
to
each
of
those
bold
outlaws
,
who
grasped
it
in
silence
,
with
tearful
eyes
.
<EOS>
Then
seizing
their
weapons
,
they
rushed
forth
,
while
Bonardi
immediately
entered
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
,
where
the
bright
light
,
as
it
fell
upon
his
features
and
form
,
exhibited
a
sight
most
sad
to
behold
,
and
where
he
was
greeted
with
a
wiid
,
universal
shriek
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
pale
—
in
fact
bloody
,
bloodless
,
and
ghastly
.
<EOS>
His
features
exhibited
the
expression
of
great
mental
and
bodily
suffering
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
wild
and
blood
-
shot
—
his
hair
dishevelled
,
matted
,
and
in
some
places
stained
with
blood
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
disordered
,
torn
,
and
bloody
also
.
<EOS>
One
hand
,
bloody
likewise
,
was
pressed
upon
his
side
,
where
appeared
to
be
a
wound
.
<EOS>
"Ronald
!
<EOS>
My
God
,
Ronald
!
"
screamed
Inez
,
who
was
springing
forward
to
meet
him
;
and
throwing
up
her
hands
,
she
staggered
back
and
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
sir
,
you
are
wounded
—
are
killed
,
perhaps
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
my
death
wound
,
Emily
,
but
heed
it
not
.
<EOS>
You
,
Inez
,
Hetty
and
Cyntha
,
must
escape
!
<EOS>
We
shall
ere
long
be
attacked
.
<EOS>
I
have
time
to
explain
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
shall
die
here
.
<EOS>
How
is
Inez
,
Cyntha
?
"
<EOS>
enquired
he
,
turning
to
the
latter
,
who
with
Hetty
had
rushed
to
her
on
her
fall
,
and
was
now
placing
her
on
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
"Missus
<EOS>
dying
!
<EOS>
She
jus
gasp
um
once
,
massa
!
"
answered
the
terrified
Cyntha
.
<EOS>
"Inez
,
dear
Inez
!
"
cried
Ronald
,
darting
forward
,
placing
his
arm
under
her
head
,
and
supporting
her
against
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Inez
opened
her
eyes
,
and
looked
up
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
Then
she
uttered
a
wild
scream
,
and
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
,
where
she
clung
as
if
fearful
of
being
torn
away
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
Ronald
,
"
this
is
the
most
trying
moment
of
all
.
<EOS>
Inez
,
Inez,—dear
Inez
—
for
God
-
sake
,
Inez
,
look
up!—awake!—look
up!—you
must
escape!""Escape
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Inez
,
starting
back
her
head
,
and
gazing
into
his
face
in
terror
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
escape
!
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
be
attacked
,
and
you
must
not
be
here
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
accursed
minions
of
the
law!""And
<EOS>
you
,
Ronald?""I
<EOS>
can
not
escape
:
I
am
wounded
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
could
you
think
your
Inez
would
leave
you
thus
,
Ronald
?
<EOS>
Never
,
never
,
never
!
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
if
you
die
,
Inez
will
die
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
and
again
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
,
and
clung
to
him
wildly
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
started
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
wounded
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
me
see
it
!
<EOS>
I
will
staunch
the
blood
!
<EOS>
It
shall
not
,
shall
not
kill
you
,
dear
,
dear
<EOS>
Ronald!""'Tis
vain
,
Inez
,
'
<EOS>
tis
vain
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
groaned
he
,
straining
her
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
wound
is
mortal
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
Inez
,
you
must
fly
!
<EOS>
If
I
know
you
are
safe
,
I
can
die
content
.
<EOS>
""Never
,
never
,
never
,
Ronald
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
leave
you!""But
<EOS>
,
Inez"—and
Ronald
whispered
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
Inez
trembled
,
and
grew
a
shade
more
pale
;
but
still
she
answered
firmly
,
"
I
will
remain
.
<EOS>
""Enough
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
Ronald
strained
her
to
his
heart
again
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
easing
her
upon
the
sofa
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Emily
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
"
you
must
fly
this
moment
!
<EOS>
Hetty
and
Cyntha
will
go
with
you
!
"
and
turning
to
the
latter
<EOS>
,
he
placed
in
her
hand
a
purse
of
gold
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
my
faithful
Cyntha
,
go
!
<EOS>
and
may
you
escape
and
be
happy
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
leave
missus?""I
will
tend
on
her
,
Cyntha
,
so
no
more
.
<EOS>
Emily
,
here
,
"
and
he
drew
forth
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
In
this
you
will
find
the
explanation
I
promised
you
,
regarding
your
parents
.
<EOS>
Do
not
open
it
until
you
hear
of
my
death
,
which
will
not
be
long
.
<EOS>
It
is
brief
,
but
comprehensive
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
it
in
haste
,
since
I
saw
you
,
for
I
feared
we
should
never
meet
again
.
<EOS>
At
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
a
boat
awaits
you
,
manned
by
three
trusty
followers
,
who
will
conduct
you
to
a
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Emily
,
"
and
his
voice
faltered
,
"
it
only
remains
to
bid
you
farewell
!
"
<EOS>
and
taking
her
hand
,
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
,
respectfully
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Emily
,
weeping
bitterly
,
"
how
can
I
thank
you
for
your
generosity?""Nay
,
I
need
no
thanks
,
Emily
.
<EOS>
You
were
a
woman
,
in
the
hands
of
a
black
-
hearted
villain
,
and
I
did
but
my
duty
.
<EOS>
You
are
saved
,
and
that
villain
has
paid
the
penalty
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
John
is
—
"
"
Dead
!
"
<EOS>
said
Ronald
,
solemnly
,
concluding
the
sentence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
question
no
farther
;
you
will
learn
all
in
time
.
<EOS>
Oh
haste
,
Emily
,
and
away
,
ere
any
thing
happens
to
endanger
you!""Inez
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Emily
;
and
the
next
moment
they
were
in
each
others
arms
,
both
sobbing
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
Inez
,
sweet
lady
,
it
wrings
my
heart
to
leave
you
;
but
I
will
not
urge
you
to
go
,
for
I
can
understand
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
While
Emily
Nevance
lives
,
Inez
and
Ronald
Bonardi
will
never
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dear
Inez
;
farewell
,
farewell
!
"
<EOS>
and
straining
her
once
more
to
her
heart
,
she
pressed
a
kiss
upon
her
lips
,
sprang
away
,
and
disappeared
into
the
Outer
Cave
.
<EOS>
Hetty
and
Cyntha
took
an
affectionate
leave
,
and
disappeared
also
,
both
weeping
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
all
three
were
seated
in
a
boat
without
the
cave
.
<EOS>
"Farewell
,
"
uttered
Bonardi
,
who
had
followed
them
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
,
waiving
his
hand
solemnly
:
"
Farewell
!
"
<EOS>
The
next
moment
the
boat
shot
away
,
and
turning
,
Bonardi
descended
the
ladder
with
a
quick
step
.
<EOS>
Drawing
forth
a
key
,
attached
to
his
person
by
a
small
gold
chain
,
he
glided
behind
the
ladder
,
and
opened
an
iron
door
,
which
concealed
an
aperture
in
the
solid
rock
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
door
of
a
powder
magazine
.
<EOS>
Hastily
taking
thence
some
eight
or
ten
casks
,
he
gazed
on
them
a
moment
,
with
a
singular
smile
,
and
then
proceeded
to
arrange
them
along
the
wall
,
at
certain
distances
from
each
other
,
until
the
two
last
came
within
the
Inner
Cave
.
<EOS>
He
then
uncorked
,
and
attached
a
train
of
towe
,
soaked
in
turpentine
,
to
each
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
returned
to
Inez
,
clasped
her
in
his
arms
,
cast
himself
upon
a
sofa
,
and
whispered
in
her
ear:"Now
,
dear
Inez
,
let
them
come
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
meantime
,
the
boat
,
bearing
Emily
,
Hetty
and
Cyntha
,
reached
the
Entrance
,
which
was
the
juncture
of
the
creek
and
river
Osage
,
and
so
called
from
its
being
<EOS>
the
only
point
whence
<EOS>
the
cave
could
be
approached
.
<EOS>
On
either
hand
was
a
high
bluff
,
which
gave
the
channel
running
back
to
the
cave
an
appearance
of
being
artificial
.
<EOS>
The
bluff
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
Osage
,
and
immediately
around
the
Entrance
,
was
very
steep
and
rocky
,
covered
with
a
stunted
growth
of
trees
and
underbrush
,
so
that
a
large
party
might
be
there
concealed
in
ambush
.
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
Emily
,
and
the
two
females
with
her
,
were
landed
,
and
then
immediately
conducted
up
the
steep
.
<EOS>
As
she
went
up
the
winding
path
,
she
could
occasionally
perceive
,
on
either
hand
,
a
dark
figure
,
crouched
in
the
bushes
,
with
a
rifle
either
resting
against
his
shoulder
,
or
poised
and
pointed
toward
the
river
,
whom
she
rightly
conjectured
to
be
of
Bonardi
's
band
,
and
that
—
but
why
she
knew
not
—
they
expected
an
attack
from
below
.
<EOS>
When
she
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
she
could
perceive
the
sun
shining
upon
a
beautiful
and
variegated
landscape
,
through
a
crimson
mellow
haze
,
within
an
hour
of
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
—
At
another
time
perhaps
,
she
would
have
paused
to
admire
the
scenery
,
and
contemplate
the
rich
beauty
of
light
and
shade
,
as
,
striking
some
high
point
,
with
a
golden
sheen
,
the
rays
of
Sol
threw
a
long
line
of
shadow
into
the
quiet
valley
at
its
base
,
or
glanced
off
from
the
smooth
surface
of
many
a
stream
—
not
excepting
the
Osage
,
and
the
great
Missouri
,
the
latter
some
several
miles
distant
—
as
from
a
polished
mirror
;
but
now
her
thoughts
were
sad
and
painful
;
and
she
turned
from
this
to
her
conductor
—
who
here
come
to
a
halt
,
and
was
looking
eagerly
in
every
direction
—
with
an
enquiring
gaze
.
<EOS>
"You'll
have
to
mount
and
fly
,
gal
,
"
said
he
,
at
length
,
turning
to
her
;
"
for
if
I
arn't
mistaken
,
it
'll
be
no
place
for
you
here
shortly
.
<EOS>
Thar
's
a
body
of
men
coming
by
land
,
and
another
by
water
;
"
and
he
pointed
to
where
the
smoke
of
a
steamer
indicated
its
advance
up
the
Osage
,
some
three
miles
distant
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
latter
,
by
the
way
,
which
Bonardi
had
discovered
from
one
of
the
bluffs
,
that
had
made
him
so
apprehensive
of
a
sudden
attack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Right
round
this
ere
rock
,
"
continued
the
man
,
"
is
four
blooded
horses
;
but
as
thar
'
ai
nt
but
three
o
'
ye
,
I
suppose
the
cap'en
overrated
the
number
as
was
to
ride
'em
,
or
else
his
wife
'
scapes
another
way
.
<EOS>
"
As
he
spoke
,
the
party
turned
the
angle
of
a
huge
rock
,
where
were
found
four
fine
horses
,
well
caparisoned
for
riders
.
"
<EOS>
Mount
,
gal
,
and
ride
hard
to
the
east
,
and
you
'll
soon
be
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
way
of
a
scrimmage
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
a
few
minutes
all
three
were
mounted
,
and
thanking
him
kindly
for
his
services
,
Emily
led
the
way
down
the
hill
,
with
feelings
better
imagined
than
described
,
while
her
conductor
,
turning
short
around
,
speedily
rejoined
his
companions
.
<EOS>
The
party
in
ambush
was
commanded
by
Piketon
,
who
had
orders
from
Bonardi
to
annoy
the
party
attacking
as
much
as
possible
,
without
sacrificing
his
own
men
;
and
,
if
pressed
hard
,
to
escape
as
best
they
might
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
him
;
but
,
under
no
consideration
,
to
allow
a
man
of
them
to
return
to
the
cave
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
individual
who
conducted
Emily
up
the
hill
returned
,
he
immediately
sought
the
lieutenant
,
whom
he
found
leaning
against
a
tree
,
rifle
in
hand
—
for
since
their
return
,
the
party
,
in
addition
to
their
other
weapons
,
had
armed
themselves
with
rifles
and
short
swords
—
and
gazing
down
upon
the
dark
waters
of
the
Osage
,
with
a
gloomy
look
and
clouded
brow
.
"How
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
lieutenant
,
suddenly
starting
at
a
remark
the
other
now
whispered
in
his
ear
.
"
<EOS>
By
land
,
too
?
<EOS>
Are
you
sure?""Sure
!
"
answered
the
other
.
<EOS>
"What
distance
from
us?""About
five
miles
,
as
near
as
I
could
reckon
.
<EOS>
—
I
jest
catched
a
glimpse
on
'em
going
behind
a
hill
.
<EOS>
""I
feared
so
<EOS>
,
I
feared
so
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
lieutenant
,
biting
his
nether
lip
.
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
time
to
give
these
others
one
good
round
,
however
,
and
then
we
must
escape
.
<EOS>
What
ho
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
:
"
Listen
all
!
<EOS>
Comrades
,
there
are
two
parties
approaching
to
attack
us
.
<EOS>
One
comes
by
water
,
the
other
by
land
.
<EOS>
The
one
by
water
will
shortly
be
here
.
<EOS>
We
must
manage
to
give
the
latter
one
deadly
round
,
and
then
fly
to
the
Retreat
,
where
are
horses
in
waiting
,
and
thence
along
the
banks
of
the
Osage
,
following
the
course
of
the
stream
,
far
back
into
the
country
;
by
which
means
we
shall
avoid
the
others
,
with
whom
our
numbers
are
too
few
to
engage
in
conflict
,
and
where
we
will
remain
until
the
excitement
has
died
away
,
when
those
who
have
wives
and
children
can
return
for
them
,
and
then
quietly
leave
this
accursed
country
forever
.
<EOS>
Such
are
the
orders
of
our
noble
captain
,
Ronald
Bonardi
,
who
is
mortally
wounded
;
and
who
,
for
his
own
design
,
chooses
to
remain
in
the
cave
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
this
,
Piketon
proceeded
to
dispose
of
his
men
,
so
as
for
each
to
lie
in
perfect
concealment
to
those
below
,
with
orders
that
so
soon
as
practicable
,
each
was
to
select
his
man
,
and
,
at
the
word
,
to
pour
a
terrible
volley
of
death
among
them
,
and
then
rush
up
the
hill
and
escape
.
<EOS>
This
being
done
,
all
relapsed
into
silence
—
a
silence
to
be
shortly
broken
by
the
awful
mandate
of
death
.
<EOS>
The
steamer
which
left
St.
Louis
during
the
night
,
was
,
in
the
meantime
,
slowly
approaching
.
<EOS>
The
rendezvous
of
the
banditti
had
been
so
accurately
described
by
the
traitor
John
,
that
there
was
but
little
danger
of
those
in
command
mistaking
the
place
;
still
it
required
a
careful
examination
of
the
shore
,
as
they
approached
,
and
this
examination
they
were
now
making
.
<EOS>
In
about
twenty
minutes
she
hove
full
in
sight
of
the
concealed
bandits
,
who
clasped
their
rifles
with
the
nervous
grasp
of
determined
and
desperate
men
.
<EOS>
In
ten
more
she
had
thrown
off
her
steam
,
and
lay
floating,"Like
a
thing
of
life,"on
the
dark
bosom
of
the
Osage
below
them
.
<EOS>
"This
must
be
the
place
,
"
said
a
deep
voice
on
board
.
<EOS>
"
Yonder
is
the
inlet
.
<EOS>
Man
the
boats!"Instantly
a
dozen
boats
suspended
to
the
steamer
for
the
purpose
,
were
lowered
into
the
water
,
and
quickly
filled
with
armed
men
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
ere
we
proceed
,
let
us
give
a
word
or
two
in
explanation
.
<EOS>
From
the
information
conveyed
by
John
,
it
was
gathered
that
the
outlaws
,
who
might
chance
to
escape
the
attack
on
the
Mississippi
,
would
here
rally
as
their
stronghold
,
and
doubtless
here
make
their
last
desperate
<EOS>
resistance,—particularly
Bonardi
,
who
,
he
stated
,
would
return
hither
to
seek
his
wife
,
and
,
from
his
character
,
be
little
likely
to
fly,—consequently
this
was
the
place
to
be
immediately
sought
,
to
give
the
final
blow
of
extermination
to
the
banditti
.
<EOS>
On
this
information
the
authorities
had
acted
,
and
hence
the
arrival
of
the
steamer
for
this
purpose
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
boats
were
manned
,
a
stout
figure
sprang
into
the
forward
one
,
and
stood
erect
in
the
bow
.
<EOS>
"Six
of
you
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
,
quick
tone
,
"
will
remain
behind
to
cover
us
,
and
prevent
an
attack
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
The
six
with
myself
will
now
forward
to
the
cave
,
which
we
must
enter
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
Row
,
men
,
row
!
<EOS>
Fifty
dollars
to
him
who
first
enters
the
cave
!
<EOS>
An
hundred
to
him
who
captures
the
body
of
Barton
—
alias
Bonardi
—
living
or
<EOS>
dead!"The
words
were
scarcely
out
of
the
speaker
's
mouth
,
when
six
boats
shot
out
from
the
rest
,
and
entered
the
channel
,
each
straining
as
for
life
to
be
first
at
the
cave
.
"Now
<EOS>
then
,
comrades
,
"
whispered
Piketon
,
"
pick
your
men
on
the
river
,
and
do
not
waste
powder
!
<EOS>
One
farewell
volley
,
and
then
for
our
horses
,
as
the
others
must
be
near
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
our
captain
?
"
said
one
,
enquiringly
.
<EOS>
"Fear
not
for
him
,
"
answered
Piketon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
some
deep
design
in
view
,
doubtless
,
as
this
was
to
me
his
last
solemn
injunction
.
<EOS>
Now
then
,
comrades,—ready
<EOS>
—
fire!"The
<EOS>
last
word
was
drowned
in
a
roar
of
musketry
,
that
rolled
heavily
across
the
Osage
,
and
reverberated
from
cliff
to
cliff
,
echoing
far
away
into
the
solitary
retreat
of
many
a
wild
beast
,
startling
him
from
his
lair
,
while
groans
,
shrieks
,
and
curses
,
immediately
resounded
from
the
boats
,
where
all
was
consternation
and
confusion
—
<EOS>
not
less
than
twenty
having
fallen
under
the
fire
,
most
of
them
dead
,
and
the
others
,
with
but
three
exceptions
,
mortally
wounded
.
<EOS>
"Ho
!
<EOS>
pursue
them
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
a
hoarse
voice
,
from
one
of
the
boats
;
and
the
speaker
pointed
up
the
hill
,
where
the
bandits
were
seen
making
their
escape
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
a
minute
elapsed
,
ere
the
dead
and
wounded
were
placed
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
,
and
the
boats
touched
the
store
.
<EOS>
Leaping
at
once
upon
the
bank
,
they
darted
up
the
steep
acelivity
,
and
some
of
them
had
reached
within
a
few
yards
of
the
summit
,
when
suddenly
all
paused
,
as
by
common
consent
,
and
their
faces
blanched
with
absolute
terror
.
<EOS>
The
ground
beneath
them
trembled
,
as
by
the
throes
of
an
earthquake
;
and
then
there
came
a
tremendous
,
heavy
,
booming
sound
,
seemingly
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
below
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
a
dead
silence
ensued
;
and
then
wild
shrieks
,
from
distant
voices
,
rent
the
air
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
cave!—the
cave!—they
have
blown
up
the
cave!"Horror
stricken
at
this
awful
announcement
,
they
turned
and
rushed
back
to
their
boats
,
in
wild
dismay
,
only
to
find
,
shortly
after
,
this
terrible
intelligence
confirmed
by
their
own
observation
.
<EOS>
Of
the
party
that
entered
the
channel
,
upwards
of
fifty
in
number
,
some
thirty
had
reached
the
cave
and
disappeared
,
while
the
others
were
eagerly
pressing
forward
,
when
Bonardi
,
with
Inez
clasped
to
his
heart
,
fired
the
train
,
and
himself
,
with
every
soul
within
,
was
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
launched
into
eternity
.
<EOS>
As
the
explosion
took
place
,
and
the
cries
ascended
from
those
in
the
creek
,
who
had
escaped
,
announcing
the
awful
calamity
,
a
voice
from
the
brow
of
the
hill
shrieked:"Oh
God
!
<EOS>
oh
God
!
<EOS>
she
is
lost
!
"
and
Edward
Merton
reeled
to
and
fro
,
and
finally
sank
to
the
earth
;
while
the
tall
,
gaunt
figure
of
Harvey
Bernard
stood
over
him
,
with
a
look
of
the
most
intense
anguish
depicted
on
his
honest
,
open
features
.
<EOS>
"Poor
youth
!
"
<EOS>
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
poor
Emily
;
"
and
kneeling
by
Edward
,
he
wrung
his
horny
hands
,
and
gave
vent
to
his
grief
in
choking
sobs
,
that
made
his
strong
,
muscular
frame
quiver
.
<EOS>
A
quick
rustling
among
the
bushes
startled
him
.
<EOS>
On
looking
up
,
he
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
staggered
back
several
paces
,
and
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
.
"Emily
!
<EOS>
"
he
shrieked
,
"
alive?"At
the
word
Emily
,
Edward
bounded
to
his
feet
,
and
saw
her
,
but
a
few
paces
distant
,
rushing
toward
him
.
"Emily
!
"
<EOS>
he
gasped
,
scarcely
crediting
his
senses
.
"Edward
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
next
moment
they
were
locked
in
each
others
embrace
,
and
so
overcome
with
joy
,
that
for
a
time
all
power
of
utterance
was
lost
;
while
Bernard
,
in
a
delirium
of
ecstacy
,
fairly
danced
about
them
,
and
actually
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
kick
several
stones
down
the
hill
,
to
the
no
small
annoyance
of
some
of
the
party
hurrying
up
from
below
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
wild
meeting
,
that
of
the
lovers
,
in
that
wild
region
,
and
at
a
moment
too
so
awfully
terrible
,
when
not
less
than
forty
human
beings
,
without
a
second
's
warning
,
had
just
been
ushered
into
the
presence
of
their
Maker
;
when
groans
and
shrieks
from
the
dying
,
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
,
were
mingling
with
the
hoarse
shouts
and
cries
of
those
who
had
escaped
their
untimely
fate
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
wild
meeting
,
that
of
the
lovers
,
and
one
that
by
them
would
never
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
As
the
reader
is
aware
,
Merton
and
Bernard
had
set
out
in
the
morning
,
with
a
party
rising
of
forty
men
,
to
seek
the
rendezvous
of
the
banditti
,
rescue
Emily
,
and
punish
the
offenders
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
the
thoughts
and
emotions
,
the
hopes
and
fears
,
agitating
the
breast
of
the
former
,
during
that
eventful
day
,
(
when
his
mind
ran
on
the
perils
seemingly
surrounding
her
he
loved
,
)
but
leave
these
to
the
imagination
of
the
reader
,
for
our
space
is
already
limited
.
<EOS>
Suffice
,
that
a
hard
day
's
ride
of
bodily
fatigue
and
mental
anxiety
,
had
brought
him
to
the
spot
where
we
now
find
him
.
<EOS>
When
within
three
miles
of
the
place
,
Edward
had
descried
the
steamer
;
and
divining
at
once
her
purpose
,
had
become
very
much
alarmed
,
lest
there
should
be
a
fight
,
wherein
,
as
he
thought
,
Emily
must
necessarily
become
involved
.
<EOS>
Whispering
his
fears
to
his
companion
Bernard
,
both
instantly
drove
their
spurs
into
their
horses
'
sides
,
and
set
rapidly
forward
,
in
advance
of
the
others
.
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
whereon
they
now
stood
,
they
found
it
too
steep
for
a
speedy
ascent
with
their
horses
,
which
were
already
very
much
blown
,
and
leaping
from
their
backs
,
they
darted
up
on
foot
.
<EOS>
They
had
proceeded
but
<EOS>
a
few
paces
,
when
they
heard
the
report
of
a
volley
of
fire
-
arms
,
which
caused
them
to
redouble
their
speed
.
<EOS>
On
their
way
,
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
flying
bandits
,
some
distance
to
the
left
;
but
heeding
them
not
,
they
still
pressed
on
,
and
at
length
,
pale
with
excitement
,
and
breathless
with
bodily
exertion
,
they
reached
the
summit
.
<EOS>
As
they
came
in
full
view
of
the
steamer
,
the
awful
explosion
at
the
cave
took
place
;
and
Edward
,
thinking
Emily
was
within
,
and
now
lost
to
him
for
ever
,
uttered
the
words
recorded
,
and
sank
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
As
to
Emily
herself
,
she
had
ridden
,
in
company
with
Hetty
and
Cyntha
,
some
two
miles
,
when
she
perceived
a
body
of
men
,
about
a
mile
to
the
right
of
her
,
rapidly
advancing
toward
the
spot
she
had
but
lately
quitted
,
and
where
she
knew
the
bandits
were
lying
in
ambush
.
<EOS>
Some
little
distance
in
advance
of
the
main
body
,
she
descried
two
horsemen
,
whom
her
eyes
and
heart
at
once
told
her
were
Edward
and
Bernard
,
Fearful
lest
the
one
she
loved
,
with
his
compan
ion
,
might
heedlessly
run
into
an
ambush
,
that
would
cost
both
of
them
their
lives
,
she
suddenly
wheeled
her
animal
,
and
,
without
a
word
to
the
others
,
darted
away
to
intercept
them
.
<EOS>
But
in
laying
out
her
line
of
interception
,
the
angle
was
too
abruptly
formed
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
she
had
fallen
somewhat
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Had
they
even
for
a
moment
glanced
to
the
right
,
they
must
have
seen
her
;
but
with
their
eyes
intent
upon
one
point
,
she
had
escaped
their
observation
.
<EOS>
When
they
sprang
from
their
horses
,
at
the
base
of
the
hill
,
she
was
but
a
few
rods
distant
.
<EOS>
Ere
they
arrived
half
way
to
the
summit
,
she
had
dismounted
and
was
struggling
up
after
them
,
but
too
much
exhausted
to
gain
their
ears
with
her
voice
.
<EOS>
Their
meeting
the
reader
has
already
seen
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
leaving
Edward
and
Emily
to
the
holy
commune
of
love
,
and
the
relation
of
such
other
matters
as
are
already
familiar
to
the
reader
,
with
a
few
brief
remarks
we
shall
close
this
chapter
.
<EOS>
The
party
of
which
Merton
and
Bernard
formed
a
portion
,
on
seeing
them
ride
forward
in
such
haste
,
increased
their
speed
,
and
presently
joined
them
on
the
hill
,
where
they
received
the
sad
intelligence
of
what
had
taken
place
,
and
also
learned
that
the
bandits
had
effected
their
escape
,
without
the
loss
of
a
man
Of
those
who
were
in
the
cave
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
,
not
one
could
be
recognised
—
so
mangled
were
they
,
and
torn
,
and
blackened
with
powder
.
<EOS>
The
cave
itself
,
though
not
utterly
demolished
,
was
so
rent
and
shattered
—
both
apartments
being
blown
into
one
—
that
those
who
may
chance
to
view
it
at
the
present
day
,
will
fail
,
doubtless
,
to
recognise
that
almost
classic
beauty
belonging
to
it
prior
to
and
at
the
date
of
our
story
;
or
,
what
is
more
,
may
even
fail
to
recognise
the
cave
at
all
.
<EOS>
For
the
benefit
of
the
curious
,
however
,
and
lest
some
may
deem
it
a
fabulous
one
,
we
will
here
assert
that
the
cave
is
still
in
existence
,
and
can
be
seen
by
those
who
may
be
disposed
to
seek
it
.
<EOS>
As
the
party
just
arrived
soon
discovered
their
presence
was
no
longer
necessary
,
and
as
the
sun
was
already
near
the
line
of
the
western
horizon
,
they
immediately
set
out
upon
their
return
,
accompanied
by
Bernard
,
Edward
and
Emily
.
<EOS>
Hetty
and
Cyntha
soon
after
joined
them
,
both
of
whom
,
to
their
no
small
surprise
and
terror
,
were
immediately
taken
into
custody
,
to
be
conveyed
to
St.
Louis
for
examination
;
and
particularly
the
latter
,
who
had
no
papers
to
show
that
she
was
free
.
<EOS>
About
five
miles
from
the
Osage
,
the
party
found
a
convenient
place
,
and
quartered
for
the
night
,
during
which
Cyntha
effected
her
escape
,
and
was
never
afterwards
heard
from,—she
probably
having
again
joined
the
escaped
outlaws
.
<EOS>
At
daylight
on
the
following
morning
,
each
resumed
their
journey
,
much
refreshed
by
a
good
night
's
rest
,
and
for
some
thirty
miles
traveled
in
company
,
when
they
gradually
began
to
separate
,
as
here
and
there
one
after
another
turned
off
to
seek
their
nearest
course
home
.
<EOS>
Some
three
hours
after
nightfall
,
Bernard
,
Edward
and
Emily
arrived
at
Webber
's
,
having
traveled
the
last
five
miles
entirely
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
party
on
the
steamer
remained
at
the
cave
during
the
night
,
and
on
the
day
following
,
after
having
interred
the
remains
of
all
those
found
in
the
cave
,
started
upon
their
return
,
with
what
feelings
<EOS>
we
leave
the
reader
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
Of
the
party
of
Piketon
,
we
can
only
say
they
were
never
again
heard
of
in
that
country
.
<EOS>
—
What
became
of
them
is
unknown
.
<EOS>
Probably
they
sought
some
remote
place
,
and
perhaps
settled
down
,
many
of
them
,
into
peaceable
citizens
—
who
shall
say
?
<EOS>
No
little
wonderment
was
created
among
some
of
the
oldest
settlers
,
to
find
that
here
and
there
an
old
neighbor
had
suddenly
and
mysteriously
disappeared
—
in
many
cases
whole
families
also
—
and
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
reconcile
their
minds
to
the
fact
,
that
in
the
persons
of
those
neighbors
had
existed
many
of
the
most
formidable
members
of
the
dread
banditti
.
<EOS>
On
the
night
following
the
one
in
which
Bonardi
blew
up
the
cave
—
wherein
Saxton
and
Niles
perished
—
in
a
miserable
hoved
,
unfriended
and
alone
,
the
wretched
outcast
Curdish
breathed
his
last
.
<EOS>
The
wound
in
his
shoulder
,
given
by
Bernard
,
having
mortified
,
produced
his
death
.
<EOS>
So
perish
the
guilty
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
one
after
one
,
in
various
ways
,
have
we
seen
our
characters
disappear
,
until
but
a
few
remain
.
<EOS>
Well
,
like
to
them
,
one
after
one
,
shall
we
also
disappear
,
and
perchance
without
a
friendly
hand
being
raised
to
record
that
we
have
been
.
<EOS>
Let
us
now
turn
once
more
to
the
living
of
our
drama
of
life
,
take
a
farewell
view
,
and
then
let
the
curtain
descend
and
shut
them
from
our
sight
forever
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
V.THE
LOVERS
—
THE
MYSTERY
UNRAVELLED
—
THE
LETTER
—
THE
FINALE.It
was
a
beautiful
morning
,
about
a
week
from
the
return
of
Emily
,
and
every
thing
in
nature
looked
bright
and
animated
.
<EOS>
A
gentle
rain
had
fallen
during
the
night
,
and
the
drops
were
still
lingering
on
leaf
and
blade
and
flower
,
and
sparkling
in
the
morning
sunlight
,
like
so
many
diamonds
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
clear
,
soft
and
invigorating
;
and
the
light
-
footed
Zephyrs
sighed
through
the
forests
,
rustled
the
leaves
,
kissed
the
beautiful
flowers
,
and
caught
a
thousand
sweet
sounds
of
melody
to
bear
away
to
their
frolicsome
meetings
in
Fairy
Land
.
<EOS>
Before
Webber
's
cottage
,
on
the
morning
in
question
,
stood
a
gallant
steed
,
foaming
and
panting
from
hard
riding
;
while
the
rider
himself
,
having
entered
the
cottage
,
was
now
standing
in
the
apartment
where
the
gentle
Rufus
had
breathed
his
last
,
with
one
arm
thrown
lightly
around
the
waist
of
the
graceful
Emily
Nevance
,
who
,
with
her
soft
blue
eyes
turned
sweetly
upon
him
,
was
gazing
with
a
look
of
joy
,
somewhat
saddened
by
grief
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
Edward
<EOS>
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
with
animation
,
"
I
joy
that
you
have
come
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
watching
for
you
since
the
first
streak
of
morning
gilded
the
east
;
for
I
knew
you
would
select
the
cool
of
the
day
,
and
ride
long
ere
daylight
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
have
been
so
sad
since
we
buried
poor
Rufus
!
"
<EOS>
and
Emily
turned
away
her
head
to
conceal
a
tear
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
dearest
<EOS>
,
"
answered
Edward
,
drawing
her
fondly
to
him
,
and
pressing
a
kiss
upon
her
lips
,
"
let
us
not
forget
,
while
we
grieve
,
that
Rufus
is
happy
now
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
fact
that
we
are
prone
to
grieve
too
much
for
departed
friends
,
and
thereby
oppose
our
selfishness
to
the
Divine
Will
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
grieving
for
the
death
of
a
friend
,
we
should
rather
rejoice
that
all
his
troubles
are
at
an
end
,
and
that
he
is
now
singing
immortal
songs
in
the
bright
regions
of
glory
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
all
must
die
,
sooner
or
late
—
that
we
are
all
wending
to
the
Spirit
Land
<EOS>
—
then
wherefore
grieve
that
one
we
love
has
reached
the
bright
goal
before
us?""I
admit
your
philosophy
is
good
,
"
rejoined
Emily
,
"
but
still
you
will
allow
philosophy
has
but
little
to
do
with
the
heart
,
with
the
affections
.
<EOS>
Philosophy
is
the
cold
emanation
of
the
brain
—
love
the
warm
offspring
of
the
heart
;
and
the
latter
,
as
a
general
thing
,
will
triumph
over
the
former
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
remarks
are
true
,
"
returned
Edward
,
"
for
such
are
the
selfish
propensities
of
human
nature
.
<EOS>
The
heart
will
for
a
time
gain
ascendency
over
the
head
<EOS>
:
love
will
triumph
over
philosophy
:
<EOS>
such
are
facts
;
and
yet
,
as
I
said
before
,
we
should
strive
to
give
the
latter
the
asceudency
,
when
we
find
the
former
can
avail
us
nothing
.
<EOS>
—
To
this
end
I
would
fain
bring
philosophy
to
my
aid
here
;
and
yet
withal
I
deeply
,
most
deeply
grieve
,
that
one
so
gentle
,
so
noble
as
Rufus
,
should
be
taken
from
among
us
,
just
in
the
bright
flower
of
manhood
.
<EOS>
For
himself
I
deeply
grieve
,
and
for
his
almost
heart
-
broken
parents
,
my
heart
bleeds
in
sympathy
;
"
and
Edward
's
voice
trembled
,
and
tears
filled
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
"
sighed
Emily
;
"
his
mother
,
poor
woman
,
I
fear
will
never
recover
from
the
shock
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
she
then
no
better
?
"
asked
Edward
.
<EOS>
Emily
shook
her
head
mournfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
she
sighed
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
saw
her
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
,
as
you
saw
her
on
your
departure
,
three
days
since
,
you
will
find
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
sits
in
a
state
of
torpor
,
twirling
her
fingers
,
but
takes
no
heed
of
what
is
said
,
or
what
is
passing
around
her
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
fear
she
will
soon
follow
him
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
Webber
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Edward
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
bears
up
as
well
as
can
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
;
but
it
was
a
hard
blow
,
a
very
hard
blow
,
to
be
made
childless
in
one
night
,
and
one
son
,
too
,
to
be
murdered
before
his
own
eyes
,
in
his
own
house
,
and
then
borne
away
no
one
knows
whither
.
<EOS>
""It
was
indeed
,
"
said
Merton
,
solemnly
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
body
of
John
has
never
been
found?""It
<EOS>
has
not
.
<EOS>
It
is
supposed
to
have
been
devoured
by
wild
beasts
,
or
thrown
into
some
stream
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
"
said
Merton
,
somewhat
sternly
,
"
he
at
least
deserved
his
fate
.
<EOS>
What
a
black
hearted
villain!""Hush
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Emily
;
"
upbraid
not
the
dead
!
<EOS>
He
is
gone
to
be
judged
for
the
deeds
done
in
the
body
.
<EOS>
He
has
suffered
the
penalty
of
his
misdeeds
,
has
paid
the
last
great
debt
of
nature
,
and
so
let
us
be
charitable
,
and
say
,
`
Requiescat
in
pace
.
'
<EOS>
But
come
,
I
am
detaining
you
,
and
you
must
be
faint
with
your
long
ride
.
<EOS>
Let
us
enter
the
other
apartment
,
where
breakfast
awaits
us
.
<EOS>
""A
moment
,
"
returned
Edward
,
taking
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
news
,
both
good
and
bad
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
With
the
steamer
which
exploded
and
went
down
on
the
night
of
that
terrible
fight
on
the
Mississippi
,
went
my
father
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
had
borrowed
on
securities
,
a
large
amount
of
specie
to
send
to
New
Orleans
.
<EOS>
It
was
lost
,
and
he
is
now
a
ruined
man
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
bad
news
.
<EOS>
The
good
is
,
that
he
has
given
his
consent
to
our
union
,
which
I
trust
will
ere
long
be
consummated
.
"
—
As
he
spoke
,
Emily
bent
down
her
eyes
,
and
a
modest
blush
suffused
her
features
.
<EOS>
"It
lightens
my
heart
much
,
dear
Edward
,
"
she
replied
at
length
,
"
to
know
that
his
consent
is
gained
;
for
somehow
I
have
felt
as
though
I
were
doing
wrong
,
in
accepting
your
hand
contrary
to
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
For
his
sake
,
dear
Edward
,
I
regret
the
loss
of
his
wealth
;
as
it
must
be
a
severe
blow
to
one
who
has
labored
so
long
and
steadfastly
to
acquire
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
lesson
will
be
a
hard
,
but
doubtless
beneficial
one
,
"
returned
Edward
,
"
by
showing
him
the
mutability
of
the
fabric
on
which
he
has
concentrated
time
and
talents
that
might
have
been
used
more
worthily
,
not
only
to
the
elevation
of
himself
,
but
of
those
around
him
.
<EOS>
No
one
,
dear
Emily
,
should
set
their
heart
upon
gold
.
<EOS>
Man
has
nobler
duties
to
perform
than
the
hoarding
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
Wealth
,
properly
used
<EOS>
,
I
will
admit
is
a
blessing
,
because
by
it
so
many
poor
human
beings
can
be
made
comfortable
and
happy
;
and
yet
how
few
of
the
wealthy
think
of
this
,
or
act
upon
it
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
use
their
gold
to
oppress
,
to
grind
the
faces
of
those
who
are
dependent
upon
them
,
and
by
such
means
make
their
wealth
a
curse
.
<EOS>
""Too
<EOS>
true
—
too
true
,
"
said
Emily
,
musingly
;
and
then
looking
up
into
Edward
's
face
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
with
a
sweet
expression
,
she
added
:
"
By
your
father
's
consent
,
dear
Edward
,
I
feel
the
only
barrier
to
our
union
removed
—
for
I
have
already
learned
who
were
my
parents!""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Edward
:
<EOS>
And
pray
who
are
you
?
<EOS>
and
how
got
you
<EOS>
the
information?""The
latter
I
received
from
Ronald
Bonardi
.
<EOS>
""Ronald
Bonardi
,
Emily
?
<EOS>
you
astonish
me!""You
will
doubtless
be
more
astonished
,
when
you
peruse
the
letter
he
gave
me
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
to
breakfast
now
,
and
then
you
shall
know
all
.
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
you
remember
the
stranger
you
saw
here
,
whom
my
guardian
found
in
the
last
stages
of
starvation
,
in
the
vault
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
""I
do
.
<EOS>
""He
stated
to
my
guardian
,
on
last
evening
,
that
he
had
something
important
to
communicate
;
and
wished
all
,
but
myself
in
particular
,
to
be
present
.
<EOS>
As
I
had
retired
to
rest
,
it
was
deferred
until
this
morning
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
dear
Edward
,
"
said
Emily
,
playfully
,
"
who
knows
but
what
that
communication
concerns
me
very
particularly?""Who
knows
?
"
<EOS>
returned
Edward
,
and
they
passed
into
the
other
apartment
.
<EOS>
Some
two
hours
from
the
foregoing
conversation
,
a
group
of
six
individuals
were
seated
in
the
same
apartment
where
this
conversation
took
place
.
<EOS>
These
consisted
of
Webber
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
,
Edward
,
Emily
and
the
stranger
—
<EOS>
Mrs
.
Webber
not
being
present
.
<EOS>
The
expressions
on
the
faces
of
each
,
were
solemn
,
even
mournful
;
for
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
had
been
of
a
nature
to
give
a
gloomy
cast
to
their
countenances
,
not
easily
to
be
erased
.
<EOS>
The
features
of
Webber
himself
were
pale
,
sad
,
and
full
of
the
furrows
of
intense
grief
and
care
.
<EOS>
Those
of
the
stranger
were
thin
and
pale
also
,
but
exhibited
nothing
of
that
ghastliness
so
apparent
on
his
first
introduction
to
the
reader
as
the
prisoner
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
The
expression
of
his
countenance
was
naturally
stern
,
and
there
were
a
few
lines
in
it
of
a
sinister
cast
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
like
one
who
,
to
use
an
old
familiar
phrase
,
had
seen
better
days
;
but
one
whose
constitution
had
been
somewhat
broken
by
irregular
habits
and
dissipation
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
turned
the
middle
age
of
life
,
and
his
hair
was
somewhat
grey
.
<EOS>
After
the
party
had
become
seated
,
and
a
momentary
silence
elapsed
,
the
stranger
,
in
a
voice
deep
,
clear
,
but
slightly
faltering
,
said:"To
do
an
act
of
justice
,
and
thereby
make
a
partial
atonement
for
my
past
crimes
,
I
have
requested
each
and
all
of
you
to
be
present
,
and
listen
to
my
tale
.
<EOS>
"Every
<EOS>
eye
was
turned
upon
him
,
with
an
enquiring
gaze
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
noticed
this
,
and
seemed
for
a
moment
not
a
little
embarrassed
;
but
summoning
all
his
resolution
to
his
aid
,
he
proceeded:"My
story
I
shall
make
as
brief
as
possible
,
for
one
likes
not
to
dwell
on
ones
misdeeds
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
Charles
Walton
—
the
place
of
my
nativity
,
England
.
<EOS>
I
was
born
rich
—
entered
college
at
a
proper
age
,
with
bright
prospects
—
fell
into
bad
company
—
gambled
much
—
drank
much
—
and
was
finally
expelled
.
<EOS>
My
parents
shortly
after
died
,
and
I
was
left
a
wealthy
heir
.
<EOS>
In
horse
-
racing
,
drinking
,
and
petty
gambling
,
I
squandered
my
property
;
and
at
the
age
of
thirty
,
found
myself
a
beggar
,
a
vagabond
,
and
a
villain
—
ready
to
do
almost
any
deed
for
money
.
<EOS>
In
this
situation
I
was
discovered
by
one
who
had
known
me
in
better
days
—
a
villain
who
had
helped
to
fleece
me
—
and
knowing
my
character
,
habits
,
and
desperate
situation
,
he
opened
to
me
his
devilish
heart
,
offered
me
a
large
sum
to
carry
out
a
design
he
had
in
view
,
which
I
accepted
,
and
became
his
tool
.
<EOS>
This
design
was
no
less
than
the
murder
of
the
only
daughter
of
Sir
Walter
Langdon
,
for
which
I
received
in
advance
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
the
mention
of
the
name
of
Langdon
,
Emily
started
and
grew
pale
,
while
her
eyes
,
fastened
upon
Walton
,
and
her
head
bent
a
little
forward
,
exhibited
the
most
intense
eagerness
for
what
was
to
follow
.
<EOS>
"The
girl
,
"
continued
Walton
,
"
by
bribing
the
nurse
,
I
managed
to
get
in
my
possession
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
sweet
little
creature
,
of
three
years
—
my
conscience
smote
me
—
<EOS>
I
could
not
murder
her
—
and
I
fled
the
country
,
bearing
her
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
took
passage
for
America
,
and
fifteen
years
ago
landed
in
Boston
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
set
forth
on
a
tour
through
the
States
,
taking
the
child
with
me
,
determined
to
abandon
her
,
so
soon
as
a
suitable
opportunity
presented
,
whereby
she
would
be
bettered
by
the
change
.
<EOS>
Chance
favored
me
.
<EOS>
I
tarried
one
night
at
a
farmer
's
house
,
the
inmates
of
which
pleased
me
,
and
in
the
morning
I
departed
,
leaving
the
child
in
their
care
,
but
stating
I
would
return
in
a
few
days
.
<EOS>
That
farmer
's
name
was
William
Webber
—
the
child
bore
that
of
Emily
Nevance
.
<EOS>
""Good
heavens
!
"
exclaimed
Webber
,
while
Merton
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
there
was
a
look
of
surprise
on
the
faces
of
Bernard
and
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
Emily
,
pale
and
trembling
with
excitement
,
leaned
back
in
her
chair
,
unable
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
Go
on
—
go
on
!
"
said
Webber
,
quickly
;
"
for
I
perceive
the
deep
mystery
of
fifteen
years
is
being
unravelled
.
<EOS>
""After
leaving
your
house
<EOS>
,
"
resumed
Walton
,
addressing
Webber
,
"
I
came
to
the
West
,
and
for
ten
years
led
a
dissolute
life
.
<EOS>
My
conscience
,
meantime
,
often
upbraided
me
for
the
crime
I
had
been
guilty
of
,
and
at
length
I
resolved
to
make
at
least
some
slight
reparation
.
<EOS>
My
money
was
now
nearly
exhausted
,
but
still
I
had
some
few
thousand
dollars
remaining
,
and
I
returned
to
the
East
,
with
the
intent
of
seeking
Emily
,
proceeding
to
England
,
and
restoring
her
to
her
rights
;
for
I
had
learned
,
withal
,
that
her
family
were
all
dead
,
and
that
the
villain
who
employed
me
to
murder
her
,
being
next
akin
,
was
now
reveling
in
the
halls
of
her
father
,
rioting
upon
his
own
ill
-
gotten
gains
.
<EOS>
For
this
purpose
,
I
say
,
I
returned
to
the
East
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
when
there
,
my
good
resolution
failed
me
,
and
I
faltered
in
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
"It
is
hard
,
gentlemen
,
for
one
who
has
made
himself
a
villain
,
to
come
forward
and
acknowledge
it
to
the
world
,
and
be
the
by
-
word
of
jeer
in
the
mouths
of
his
associates
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
which
deterred
me
,
as
it
has
deterred
many
a
wretched
being
before
me
,
from
returning
to
the
paths
of
honesty
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
false
pride
,
I
will
admit
,
but
it
is
human
nature
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
"Determined
<EOS>
,
however
,
that
my
journey
should
not
be
all
in
vain
—
that
some
good
at
least
should
accrue
from
it
—
I
employed
a
trusty
messenger
to
convey
you
a
package
,
(
wherein
was
enclosed
the
sum
of
one
thousand
dollars
,
and
a
note
explanatory
,
)
with
positive
instructions
to
the
bearer
,
that
it
should
be
placed
in
no
hands
but
yours
,
that
he
should
learn
if
the
child
was
still
living
and
doing
well
,
that
he
should
answer
no
questions
,
and
return
as
speedily
as
possible
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Webber
<EOS>
,
"
this
clears
up
another
mysterious
event
.
<EOS>
But
go
on
—
go
on!""My
<EOS>
main
object
in
this
was
the
education
of
Emily
;
for
still
it
was
my
intent
at
some
future
day
to
do
her
justice
.
<EOS>
Again
I
returned
to
the
West
,
and
during
the
four
years
following
,
squandered
or
made
way
with
most
of
my
money
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
this
period
I
found
my
health
failing
rapidly
;
and
fearful
lest
death
might
overtake
me
,
ere
<EOS>
the
grand
error
of
my
life
should
be
repaired
,
I
sought
a
magistrate
,
in
Cincinnati
,
and
had
papers
drawn
up
,
stating
the
full
particulars
concerning
the
abduction
of
the
girl
,
how
to
prove
her
identity
—
in
fact
,
everything
essential
to
the
establishing
of
her
in
her
rights
—
which
I
swore
to
and
signed
,
in
the
presence
of
two
respectable
witnesses
,
who
,
together
with
the
magistrate
,
signed
the
papers
also
.
<EOS>
These
I
carried
about
my
person
,
superscribed
to
both
Emily
Nevance
and
yourself
—
so
that
in
the
event
of
my
dying
suddenly
,
you
would
probably
receive
them
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
I
somewhat
recovered
,
and
made
another
tour
to
the
East
,
with
the
full
determination
,
if
my
life
was
spared
long
enough
,
to
return
with
Emily
to
England
.
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
and
regret
,
I
found
you
not
,
and
learned
you
were
now
living
in
the
Far
West
.
<EOS>
Resolved
to
see
you
at
all
events
,
I
returned
again
to
the
West
—
after
having
received
a
full
description
of
the
part
of
the
country
where
you
were
located
—
and
had
actually
reached
within
a
few
miles
of
your
residence
,
when
,
it
being
just
at
dark
,
I
was
set
upon
by
some
three
or
four
ruffians
,
who
seized
,
stabbed
me
twice
,
and
drew
me
aside
into
a
rough
cave
,
where
they
proceeded
to
rifle
my
person
;
while
another
—
no
less
a
villain
than
that
accursed
Jew
,
from
whom
you
rescued
me
—
perceiving
<EOS>
I
was
still
alive
,
deliberately
,
in
cold
blood
,
grinning
upon
me
the
while
,
stabbed
me
twice
himself
,
and
I
knew
no
more
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Webber
,
breaking
in
upon
the
speaker
<EOS>
,
"
this
happened
some
four
or
five
months
since?""As
near
as
I
am
able
to
judge
,
"
answered
Walton
,
"
it
did
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
were
the
stranger
supposed
to
have
been
murdered
,
and
whose
body
had
been
sunk
in
the
Maramee
—
the
case
alluded
to
in
my
remarks
a
few
mornings
since
,
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
But
proceed
,
proceed
,
for
I
am
anxious
for
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
""What
followed
this
,
"
resumed
Walton
,
"
I
am
unable
to
say
;
for
when
consciousness
returned
,
I
was
in
that
loathsome
dungeon
,
where
you
found
me
,
with
the
Jew
standing
over
me
,
grinning
horribly
,
more
like
a
thing
of
hell
than
earth
.
<EOS>
Why
my
life
had
been
spared
,
and
wounds
dressed
<EOS>
,
I
knew
not
then
;
but
afterwards
gathered
,
from
different
remarks
dropped
,
and
hints
thrown
out
by
the
Jew
,
that
,
after
his
perusal
of
those
papers
,
the
strange
and
absurd
idea
of
some
day
marrying
Emily
,
had
taken
possession
of
him
;
and
that
my
life
was
preserved
to
be
a
living
witness
in
enabling
him
to
recover
her
property
and
rights
.
<EOS>
In
this
insane
design
I
encouraged
him
,
in
the
hope
of
some
day
being
released
.
<EOS>
What
I
suffered
until
that
release
,
is
beyond
the
power
of
language
to
describe
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
For
some
days
ere
you
found
me
,
I
had
not
tasted
food
,
nor
seen
a
living
being
,

the
hideous
Jew
,
who
came
down
but
a
few
hours
before
to
murder
me
,
which
something
interrupted
,
and
saved
my
life
.
<EOS>
Such
,
friends
,
"
concluded
Walton
,
"
for
you
all
seem
like
tried
friends
to
me
,
is
my
sad
,
eventful
tale
;
and
I
throw
myself
entirely
upon
your
generosity
to
pardon
me
the
past
,
by
pledging
myself
to
make
all
the
atonement
in
my
power
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
punishment
in
my
opinion
,
has
exceeded
your
crimes
,
"
replied
Webber
,
mildly
;
"
and
were
this
not
the
case
,
I
am
not
one
of
those
selfish
beings
that
can
withold
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
from
him
who
repents
and
seeks
to
atone
for
his
past
errors
.
<EOS>
Charles
Walton
,
there
is
my
hand
;
"
and
as
he
spoke
,
Webber
arose
and
extended
his
hand
,
which
the
other
grasped
with
warmth
,
while
a
tear
sparkled
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
there
is
mine
,
"
said
Tyrone
,
coming
forward
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
mine
,
"
said
Merton
,
following
his
example
.
<EOS>
"Wal
,
old
feller
,
"
said
Bernard
,
approaching
also
,
"
I
guess
as
how
I
'll
have
to
gin
ye
<EOS>
a
grip
<EOS>
on't
tu
;
for
darn
me
,
if
I
do
n't
think
there
's
some
good
streaks
about
ye
<EOS>
anyhow
,
if
they
be
a
little
mixed
up
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
Emily
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Walton
,
deeply
affected
.
<EOS>
"O
,
sir
,
"
answered
Emily
,
with
a
sweet
smile
,
"
I
am
too
happy
in
the
present
,
to
bewail
the
past
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
done
me
wrong
,
from
my
heart
I
forgive
you
,
and
trust
that
He
who
reigns
above
will
do
likewise
.
<EOS>
""This
is
too
much
,
"
said
Walton
,
drawing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
at
least
expect
rebuke
from
some
of
you
.
<EOS>
""He
who
can
rebuke
a
repentant
man
,
himself
needs
a
rebuke
,
"
rejoined
Merton
;
"
for
there
must
be
something
wrong
,
if
not
base
and
cowardly
in
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
""Them
's
jest
my
sentiments
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bernard
;
"
for
the
man
that
wo
nt
forgive
a
feller
when
he
up
and
acknowledges
he
's
done
wrong
,
ai
nt
no
man
at
all
,
whether
he
's
dressed
up
in
broadcloth
finery
and
talks
pious
or
not
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
incomprehensible
,
how
inscrutable
are
the
ways
of
Providence
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Webber
,
musingly
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
How
intricately
our
web
of
fate
is
woven
with
that
of
others
;
between
whom
and
ourselves
,
many
times
,
there
seems
not
the
slightest
connection
,
until
a
strange
order
of
events
reveals
to
us
perhaps
,
that
years
agone
,
and
miles
apart
,
unknown
to
each
,
each
was
secretly
exercising
an
influence
upon
the
destiny
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
""Most
<EOS>
true
,
dear
guardian
,
"
said
Emily
,
in
reply
;
"
and
in
my
own
case
,
how
strangely
and
strongly
this
is
verified
!
<EOS>
Read
that
,
dear
guardian
;
"
and
she
placed
in
his
hands
the
letter
given
her
by
Bonardi
.
<EOS>
Webber
glanced
over
it
hastily
,
and
,
as
he
did
so
,
there
was
a
perceptible
start
of
surprise
on
his
features
.
<EOS>
"
Strange
—
strange
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
"
can
it
be
possible
this
is
so
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
proceeded
to
read
aloud
as
follows:"Dear
Emily:—Pardon
the
liberty
I
take
in
thus
addressing
you
,
for
it
is
perhaps
the
only
favor
I
shall
ever
ask
at
the
hands
of
one
whom
the
ties
of
consanguinity
bid
me
hold
most
dear
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
see
you
start
with
surprise
,
at
the
idea
of
the
same
blood
flowing
in
the
veins
of
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Your
father
and
mine
were
one
;
but
fortune
placed
a
wide
disparity
between
us
.
<EOS>
You
were
born
to
wealth
and
honor
—
<EOS>
I
to
poverty
and
disgrace
.
<EOS>
You
were
born
to
be
the
courted
of
society
—
I
to
be
the
outcast
.
<EOS>
And
if
we
both
had
one
father
,
what
,
you
ask
,
made
this
disparity
?
<EOS>
I
answer
,
<EOS>
you
were
born
legally
—
I
illegally
.
<EOS>
Or
,
in
other
words
,
your
mother
was
married
by
the
laws
of
the
land
,
in
the
presence
of
earthly
witnesses
—
mine
,
by
the
laws
of
honor
,
in
the
presence
of
God
only
.
<EOS>
But
enough
of
this
,
for
my
minutes
are
all
numbered
.
<EOS>
Emily
,
I
am
dying
of
a
wound
received
from
the
hands
of
the
father
of
him
whom
I
have
punished
for
turning
traitor
to
us
,
and
attempting
to
wrong
you
.
<EOS>
John
Webber
is
dead
.
<EOS>
But
ha
!
<EOS>
I
am
wandering
from
my
subject
—
<EOS>
my
thoughts
are
almost
distracted
,
and
so
pardon
me
.
<EOS>
"Some
days
since
,
in
a
conversation
with
the
father
of
John
,
I
learned
of
you
,
and
that
your
birth
was
involved
in
mystery
.
<EOS>
Having
learned
the
whole
particulars
,
and
some
slight
coincidences
recurring
to
my
mind
,
a
vague
suspicion
crossed
me
that
you
might
be
the
daughter
of
Sir
Walter
Langdon,—who
<EOS>
,
if
living
,
must
be
of
the
same
age
with
yourself
;
and
who
,
fifteen
years
ago
—
about
the
period
when
you
were
brought
to
Webber's
—
mysteriously
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
I
saw
you
first
,
in
that
wild
retreat
on
the
mountains
of
the
Osage
,
I
felt
my
suspicion
at
once
made
reality
,
from
your
strong
resemblance
to
your
father
.
<EOS>
Gods
!
<EOS>
Emily
,
what
feelings
came
over
me
then
!
<EOS>
when
I
thought
how
that
father
had
spurned
me
,
his
own
son
,
from
his
presence
,
and
was
thus
the
indirect
instrument
in
making
me
the
outlaw
I
am
!
<EOS>
But
a
terrible
retribution
followed
,
Emily
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
soon
after
died
—
your
brother
was
murdered
—
you
were
stolen
away
,
and
your
father
and
mine
died
a
childless
maniac
,
and
his
estates
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
villain
.
<EOS>
By
those
papers
destroyed
by
John
,
doubtless
you
might
have
proven
your
identity
,
and
gained
possession
of
what
is
lawfully
your
own
.
<EOS>
As
matters
are
now
,
I
fear
this
can
not
be
done
—
still
I
think
it
worth
the
trial
;
but
,
at
least
,
you
may
rest
assured
your
birth
is
noble
and
honorable
;
and
this
,
to
one
as
sensitive
as
yourself
on
the
subject
,
can
not
but
be
joyful
tidings
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
dear
Emily
,
my
sister
,
I
must
bid
you
farewell,—for
time
presses
,
and
my
wound
grows
painful
.
<EOS>
I
write
this
a
few
miles
from
the
cave
,
which
I
shall
endeavor
to
reach
alive
,
and
see
my
own
loved
Inez
once
again
.
<EOS>
If
I
succeed
,
I
shall
probably
hand
you
this
myself,—if
<EOS>
not
,
you
will
get
it
from
the
hands
of
another
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
things
of
which
I
wish
to
speak
with
you,—but
<EOS>
it
is
now
too
late
,
too
late
.
<EOS>
You
will
doubtless
hear
my
name
a
by
-
word
of
terror
,
and
my
memory
cursed
;
but
you
at
least
will
be
char
itable
and
not
curse
me
;
you
at
least
will
take
into
consideration
the
circumstances
that
have
made
me
what
I
am
;
you
at
least
may
feel
the
poor
despised
outlaw
was
not
so
bad
as
he
seemed
.
<EOS>
If
you
never
behold
me
again
,
and
Inez
survives
the
loss
,
I
pray
you
,
<EOS>
dear
Emily
,
be
to
her
a
friend
and
sister
—
<EOS>
for
she
at
least
is
innocent
of
crime
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
farewell!Ronald
Bonardi

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
VI."How
strangely
wonderful
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Webber
,
thoughtfully
,
as
he
concluded
the
letter
.
—
"
<EOS>
Were
facts
like
these
detailed
in
a
novel
,
they
would
be
considered
wild
fancies
of
the
author
's
brain
.
<EOS>
But
reality
often
exceeds
romance
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
"
said
Tyrone
,
"
all
at
least
seems
tending
to
prove
the
hitherto
unknown
Emily
Nevance
,
is
henceforth
to
be
known
as
Lady
Langdon
;
this
I
am
sure
is
a
sweet
romance
of
reality
;
"
and
he
glanced
at
Emily
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
least
,
"
returned
Walton
,
"
if
God
spares
my
life
,
I
shall
endeavor
to
make
it
so
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Emily
,
archly
,
smiling
sweetly
,
rising
and
extending
her
hand
to
Edward
:
"
Not
Lady
Langdon
,
and
so
please
you
all
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Edward
,
rapturously
,
pressing
her
hand
in
his
,
"
have
you
forgotton
,
Emily
,
that
when
I
was
rich
you
were
about
to
refuse
me
,
because
you
were
poor
;
and
now
that
the
tables
are
turned
,
I
—
"
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Emily
,
placing
her
hand
upon
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
"That
's
right
,
<EOS>
Emily
,
that
's
right
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bernard
,
rubbing
his
hands
and
smiling
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
him
make
<EOS>
a
fool
o
'
<EOS>
himself
now
,
jest
at
the
windup
like
.
<EOS>
"Edward
made
no
reply
,
but
drawing
the
blushing
Emily
aside
,
whispered
something
in
her
ear
,
stole
a
kiss
,
and
both
were
happy
.
<EOS>
Six
months
from
the
foregoing
events
produced
a
great
change
in
the
positions
of
our
characters
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Webber
had
followed
her
son
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Bernard
had
returned
to
settle
in
the
East
--
where
he
afterwards
married
and
lived
a
happy
life
.
<EOS>
Tyrone
had
set
up
in
his
profession
of
lawyer
,
in
St.
Louis
—
a
profession
in
which
he
afterwards
distinguished
himself
.
<EOS>
Edward
had
been
united
to
the
lovely
Emily
;
and
accompanied
by
Webber,—who
,
after
the
death
of
his
family
,
had
disposed
of
his
property
—
and
by
Hetty
,
who
had
been
released
,
and
who
begged
to
accompany
Emily
in
the
capacity
of
a
servant
—
and
by
Walton
,
who
,
true
to
his
promise
,
determined
to
restore
Emily
to
<EOS>
her
rights,—they
had
set
sail
for
England
,
where
the
latter
soon
after
obtained
possession
of
what
was
rightfully
her
own
,
and
where
she
and
Edward
lived
in
happy
affluence
,
to
tell
their
children
many
a
wild
story
of
the
Backwoods
of
America
,
and
of
their
own
singular
connection
with
the
Bandits
of
the
Osage
.
