How
much
is
conveyed
in
those
two
short
words
---
"
The
Parish
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
how
many
tales
of
distress
and
misery
,
of
broken
fortune
and
ruined
hopes
,
too
often
of
unrelieved
wretchedness
and
successful
knavery
,
are
they
associated
!
 
<EOS>
A
poor
man
,
with
small
earnings
,
and
a
large
family
,
just
manages
to
live
on
from
hand
to
mouth
,
and
to
procure
food
from
day
to
day
;
he
has
barely
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
present
cravings
of
nature
,
and
can
take
no
heed
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
His
taxes
are
in
arrear
,
quarter
-
day
passes
by
,
another
quarter
-
day
arrives
:
 
he
can
procure
no
more
quarter
for
himself
,
and
is
summoned
by
---
the
parish
.
 
<EOS>
His
goods
are
distrained
,
his
children
are
crying
with
cold
and
hunger
,
and
the
very
bed
on
which
his
sick
wife
is
lying
,
is
dragged
from
beneath
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
he
do
?
 
<EOS>
To
whom
is
he
to
apply
for
relief
?
 
<EOS>
To
private
charity
?
 
<EOS>
To
benevolent
individuals
?
 
<EOS>
Certainly
not
---
there
is
his
parish
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
the
parish
vestry
,
the
parish
infirmary
,
the
parish
surgeon
,
the
parish
officers
,
the
parish
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
Excellent
institutions
,
and
gentle
,
kind
-
hearted
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
dies
---
she
is
buried
by
the
parish
.
<EOS>
The
children
have
no
protector
---
they
are
taken
care
of
by
the
parish
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
first
neglects
,
and
afterwards
can
not
obtain
,
work
<EOS>
---
he
is
relieved
by
the
parish
;
and
when
distress
and
drunkenness
have
done
their
work
upon
him
,
he
is
maintained
,
a
harmless
babbling
idiot
,
in
the
parish
asylum
.
   
<EOS>
The
parish
beadle
is
one
of
the
most
,
perhaps
THE
most
,
important
member
of
 
the
local
administration
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
so
well
off
as
the
churchwardens
,
certainly
,
nor
is
he
so
learned
as
the
vestry
-
clerk
,
nor
does
he
order
things
quite
so
much
his
own
way
as
either
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
power
is
very
great
,
notwithstanding
;
and
the
dignity
of
his
office
is
never
impaired
by
the
absence
of
efforts
on
his
part
to
maintain
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
beadle
of
our
parish
is
a
splendid
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
quite
delightful
to
hear
him
,
as
he
explains
the
state
of
the
existing
poor
laws
to
the
deaf
old
women
in
the
board
-
room
passage
on
business
nights
;
and
to
hear
what
he
said
to
the
senior
churchwarden
,
and
what
the
senior
churchwarden
said
to
him
;
and
what
"
we
"
(
the
beadle
and
the
other
gentlemen
)
came
to
the
determination
of
doing
.
 
<EOS>
A
miserable
-
looking
woman
is
called
into
the
boardroom
,
and
represents
a
case
of
extreme
destitution
,
affecting
herself
---
a
widow
,
with
six
small
children
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
live
?
<EOS>
"
inquires
one
of
the
overseers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
rents
a
two
-
pair
back
,
gentlemen
,
at
Mrs
Brown
's
,
Number
3
,
Little
King
William's
-
alley
,
which
has
lived
there
this
fifteen
year
,
and
knows
me
to
be
very
hard
-
working
and
industrious
,
and
when
my
poor
husband
was
alive
,
gentlemen
,
as
died
in
the
hospital
"
---
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
interrupts
the
overseer
,
taking
a
note
of
the
address
,
"
I
'll
send
Simmons
,
the
beadle
,
to
-
morrow
morning
,
to
ascertain
whether
your
story
is
correct
;
and
if
so
,
I
suppose
you
must
have
an
order
into
the
House
---
Simmons
<EOS>
,
go
to
this
woman
's
the
first
thing
to
-
morrow
morning
,
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
Simmons
bows
assent
,
and
ushers
the
woman
out
.
<EOS>
Her
previous
admiration
of
"
the
board
"
(
who
all
sit
behind
great
books
,
and
with
their
hats
on
)
fades
into
nothing
before
her
respect
for
her
lace
-
trimmed
conductor
;
and
her
account
of
what
has
passed
inside
,
increases
---
if
that
be
possible
---
the
marks
of
respect
,
shown
by
the
assembled
crowd
,
to
that
solemn
functionary
.
<EOS>
As
to
taking
out
a
summons
,
it
's
quite
a
hopeless
case
if
Simmons
attends
it
,
on
behalf
of
the
parish
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
all
the
titles
of
the
Lord
Mayor
by
heart
;
states
the
case
without
a
single
stammer
:
and
it
is
even
reported
that
on
one
occasion
he
ventured
to
make
a
joke
,
which
the
Lord
Mayor
's
head
footman
(
who
happened
to
be
present
)
<EOS>
afterwards
told
an
intimate
friend
,
confidentially
,
was
almost
equal
to
one
of
Mr
Hobler
's
.
   
<EOS>
See
him
again
on
Sunday
in
his
state
-
coat
and
cocked
-
hat
,
with
a
large
-
headed
staff
for
show
in
his
left
hand
,
and
a
small
cane
for
use
in
his
right
.
 
<EOS>
How
pompously
he
marshals
the
children
into
their
places
!
<EOS>
and
how
demurely
the
little
urchins
look
at
him
askance
as
he
surveys
them
when
they
are
all
seated
,
with
a
glare
of
the
eye
peculiar
to
beadles
!
<EOS>
The
churchwardens
and
overseers
being
duly
installed
in
their
curtained
pews
,
he
seats
himself
on
a
mahogany
bracket
,
erected
expressly
for
him
at
the
top
of
the
aisle
,
and
divides
his
attention
between
his
prayer
-
book
and
the
boys
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
just
at
the
commencement
of
the
communion
service
,
when
the
whole
congregation
is
hushed
into
a
profound
silence
,
broken
only
by
the
voice
of
the
officiating
clergyman
,
a
penny
is
heard
to
ring
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
aisle
with
astounding
clearness
.
 
<EOS>
Observe
the
generalship
of
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
His
involuntary
look
of
horror
is
instantly
changed
into
one
of
perfect
indifference
,
as
if
he
were
the
only
person
present
who
had
not
heard
the
noise
.
 
<EOS>
The
artifice
succeeds
.
 
<EOS>
After
putting
forth
his
right
leg
now
and
then
,
as
a
feeler
,
the
victim
who
dropped
the
money
ventures
to
make
one
or
two
distinct
dives
after
it
;
and
the
beadle
,
gliding
softly
round
,
salutes
his
little
round
head
,
when
it
again
appears
above
the
seat
,
with
divers
double
knocks
,
administered
with
the
cane
before
noticed
,
to
the
intense
delight
of
three
young
men
in
an
adjacent
pew
,
who
cough
violently
at
intervals
until
the
conclusion
of
the
sermon
.
   
<EOS>
Such
are
a
few
traits
of
the
importance
and
gravity
of
a
parish
beadle
---
a
gravity
which
has
never
been
disturbed
in
any
case
that
has
come
under
our
observation
,
except
when
the
services
of
that
particularly
useful
machine
,
a
parish
fire
-
engine
,
are
required
:
then
indeed
all
is
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
Two
little
boys
run
to
the
beadle
as
fast
as
their
legs
will
carry
them
,
and
report
from
their
own
personal
observation
that
some
neighbouring
chimney
is
on
fire
;
the
engine
is
hastily
got
out
,
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
boys
being
obtained
,
and
harnessed
to
it
with
ropes
,
away
they
rattle
over
the
pavement
,
the
beadle
,
running
<EOS>
---
we
do
not
exaggerate
---
running
at
the
side
,
until
they
arrive
at
some
house
,
smelling
strongly
of
soot
,
at
the
door
of
which
the
beadle
knocks
with
considerable
gravity
for
half
-
an
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
No
attention
being
paid
to
these
manual
applications
,
and
the
turn
-
cock
having
turned
on
the
water
,
the
engine
turns
off
amidst
the
shouts
of
the
boys
;
it
pulls
up
once
more
at
the
work
-
house
,
and
the
beadle
"
pulls
up
"
the
unfortunate
householder
next
day
,
for
the
amount
of
his
legal
reward
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
saw
a
parish
engine
at
a
regular
fire
but
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
up
in
gallant
style
---
three
miles
and
a
half
an
hour
,
<EOS>
at
least
;
there
was
a
capital
supply
of
water
,
and
it
was
first
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Bang
went
the
pumps
---
the
people
cheered
<EOS>
---
the
beadle
perspired
profusely
;
but
it
was
unfortunately
discovered
,
just
as
they
were
going
to
put
the
fire
out
,
that
nobody
understood
the
process
by
which
the
engine
was
filled
with
water
;
and
that
eighteen
boys
,
and
a
man
,
had
exhausted
themselves
in
pumping
for
twenty
minutes
,
without
producing
the
slightest
effect
!
   
<EOS>
The
personages
next
in
importance
to
the
beadle
,
are
the
master
of
the
workhouse
and
the
parish
schoolmaster
.
 
<EOS>
The
vestry
-
clerk
,
as
everybody
knows
,
is
a
short
,
pudgy
little
man
,
in
black
,
with
a
thick
gold
watch
-
chain
of
considerable
length
,
terminating
in
two
large
seals
and
a
key
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
an
attorney
,
and
generally
in
a
bustle
;
at
no
time
more
so
,
than
when
he
is
hurrying
to
some
parochial
meeting
,
with
his
gloves
crumpled
up
in
one
hand
,
and
a
large
red
book
under
the
other
arm
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
churchwardens
and
overseers
,
we
exclude
them
altogether
,
because
all
we
know
of
them
is
,
that
they
are
usually
respectable
tradesmen
,
who
wear
hats
with
brims
inclined
to
flatness
,
and
who
occasionally
testify
in
gilt
letters
on
a
blue
ground
,
in
some
conspicuous
part
of
the
church
,
to
the
important
fact
of
a
gallery
having
being
enlarged
and
beautified
,
or
an
organ
rebuilt
.
   
<EOS>
The
master
of
the
workhouse
is
not
,
in
our
parish
---
nor
is
he
usually
in
any
other
---
one
of
that
class
of
men
the
better
part
of
whose
existence
has
passed
away
,
and
who
drag
out
the
remainder
in
some
inferior
situation
,
with
just
enough
thought
of
the
past
,
to
feel
degraded
by
,
and
discontented
with
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
unable
to
guess
precisely
to
our
own
satisfaction
what
station
the
man
can
have
occupied
before
;
we
should
think
he
had
been
an
inferior
sort
of
attorney
's
clerk
,
or
else
the
master
of
a
national
school
<EOS>
---
whatever
he
was
,
it
is
clear
his
present
position
is
a
change
for
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
His
income
is
small
certainly
,
as
the
rusty
black
coat
and
threadbare
velvet
collar
demonstrate
:
 
but
then
he
lives
free
of
house
-
rent
,
has
a
limited
allowance
of
coals
and
candles
,
and
an
almost
unlimited
allowance
of
authority
in
his
petty
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
tall
,
thin
,
bony
man
;
always
wears
shoes
and
black
cotton
stockings
with
his
surtout
;
and
eyes
you
,
as
you
pass
his
parlour
-
window
,
as
if
he
wished
you
were
a
pauper
,
just
to
give
you
a
specimen
of
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
an
admirable
specimen
of
a
small
tyrant
:
 
morose
,
brutish
,
and
ill
-
tempered
;
bullying
to
his
inferiors
,
cringing
to
his
superiors
,
and
jealous
of
the
influence
and
authority
of
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
Our
schoolmaster
is
just
the
very
reverse
of
this
amiable
official
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
one
of
those
men
one
occasionally
hears
of
,
on
whom
misfortune
seems
to
have
set
her
mark
;
nothing
he
ever
did
,
or
was
concerned
in
,
appears
to
have
prospered
.
 
<EOS>
A
rich
old
relation
who
had
brought
him
up
,
and
openly
announced
his
intention
of
providing
for
him
,
left
him
10,000L.
in
his
will
,
and
revoked
the
bequest
in
a
codicil
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
unexpectedly
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
providing
for
himself
,
he
procured
a
situation
in
a
public
office
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
clerks
below
him
,
died
off
as
if
there
were
a
plague
among
them
;
but
the
old
fellows
over
his
head
,
for
the
reversion
of
whose
places
he
was
anxiously
waiting
,
lived
on
and
on
,
as
if
they
were
immortal
.
 
<EOS>
He
speculated
and
lost
.
 
<EOS>
He
speculated
again
and
won
---
but
never
got
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
His
talents
were
great
;
his
disposition
,
easy
,
generous
and
liberal
.
 
<EOS>
His
friends
profited
by
the
one
,
and
abused
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Loss
succeeded
loss
;
misfortune
crowded
on
misfortune
;
each
successive
day
brought
him
nearer
the
verge
of
hopeless
penury
,
and
the
quondam
friends
who
had
been
warmest
in
their
professions
,
grew
strangely
cold
and
indifferent
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
children
whom
he
loved
,
and
a
wife
on
whom
he
doted
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
turned
their
backs
on
him
;
the
latter
died
broken
-
hearted
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
with
the
stream
<EOS>
---
it
had
ever
been
his
failing
,
and
he
had
not
courage
sufficient
to
bear
up
against
so
many
shocks
---
he
had
never
cared
for
himself
,
and
the
only
being
who
had
cared
for
him
,
in
his
poverty
and
distress
,
was
spared
to
him
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
period
that
he
applied
for
parochial
relief
.
 
<EOS>
Some
kind
-
hearted
man
who
had
known
him
in
happier
times
,
chanced
to
be
churchwarden
that
year
,
and
through
his
interest
he
was
appointed
to
his
present
situation
.
   
<EOS>
He
is
an
old
man
now
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
many
who
once
crowded
round
him
in
all
the
hollow
friendship
of
boon
-
companionship
,
some
have
died
,
some
have
fallen
like
himself
,
some
have
prospered
---
all
have
forgotten
him
.
 
<EOS>
Time
and
misfortune
have
mercifully
been
permitted
to
impair
his
memory
,
and
use
has
habituated
him
to
his
present
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Meek
,
uncomplaining
,
and
zealous
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
<EOS>
,
he
has
been
allowed
to
hold
his
situation
long
beyond
the
usual
period
;
and
he
will
no
doubt
continue
to
hold
it
,
until
infirmity
renders
him
incapable
,
or
death
releases
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
grey
-
headed
old
man
feebly
paces
up
and
down
the
sunny
side
of
the
little
court
-
yard
between
school
hours
,
it
would
be
difficult
,
indeed
,
for
the
most
intimate
of
his
former
friends
to
recognise
their
once
gay
and
happy
associate

in
the
person
of
the
Pauper
Schoolmaster

The

<EOS>
We
commenced
our
last
chapter
with
the
beadle
of
our
parish
,
because
we
are
deeply
sensible
of
the
importance
and
dignity
of
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
begin
the
present
,
with
the
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
Our
curate
is
a
young
gentleman
of
such
prepossessing
appearance
,
and
fascinating
manners
,
that
within
one
month
after
his
first
appearance
in
the
parish
,
half
the
young
-
lady
inhabitants
were
melancholy
with
religion
,
and
the
other
half
,
desponding
with
love
.
<EOS>
Never
were
so
many
young
ladies
seen
in
our
parish
church
on
Sunday
before
;
and
never
had
the
little
round
angels
'
faces
on
Mr
Tomkins
's
monument
in
the
side
aisle
,
beheld
such
devotion
on
earth
as
they
all
exhibited
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
when
he
first
came
to
astonish
the
parishioners
.
 
<EOS>
He
parted
his
hair
on
the
centre
of
his
forehead
in
the
form
of
a
Norman
arch
,
wore
a
brilliant
of
the
first
water
on
the
fourth
finger
of
his
left
hand
(
which
he
always
applied
to
his
left
cheek
when
he
read
prayers
)
,
and
had
a
deep
sepulchral
voice
of
unusual
solemnity
.
 
<EOS>
Innumerable
were
the
calls
made
by
prudent
mammas
on
our
new
curate
,
and
innumerable
the
invitations
with
which
he
was
assailed
,
and
which
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
readily
accepted
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
manner
in
the
pulpit
had
created
an
impression
in
his
favour
,
the
sensation
was
increased
tenfold
,
by
his
appearance
in
private
circles
.
 
<EOS>
Pews
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
pulpit
or
reading
-
desk
rose
in
value
;
sittings
in
the
centre
aisle
were
at
a
premium
:
 
an
inch
of
room
in
the
front
row
of
the
gallery
could
not
be
procured
for
love
or
money
;
and
some
people
even
went
so
far
as
to
assert
,
that
the
three
Miss
Browns
,
who
had
an
obscure
family
pew
just
behind
the
churchwardens
'
,
were
detected
,
one
Sunday
,
in
the
free
seats
by
the
communion
-
table
,
actually
lying
in
wait
for
the
curate
as
he
passed
to
the
vestry
!
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
preach
extempore
sermons
,
and
even
grave
papas
caught
the
infection
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
out
of
bed
at
half
-
past
twelve
o'clock
one
winter
's
night
,
<EOS>
to
half
-
baptise
a
washerwoman
's
child
in
a
slop
-
basin
,
and
the
gratitude
of
the
parishioners
knew
no
bounds
---
the
very
churchwardens
grew
generous
,
and
insisted
on
the
parish
defraying
the
expense
of
the
watch
-
box
on
wheels
,
which
the
new
curate
had
ordered
for
himself
,
to
perform
the
funeral
service
in
,
in
wet
weather
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
three
pints
of
gruel
and
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
tea
to
a
poor
woman
who
had
been
brought
to
bed
of
four
small
children
,
all
at
once
---
the
parish
were
charmed
.
<EOS>
He
got
up
a
subscription
for
her
---
the
woman
's
fortune
was
made
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
for
one
hour
and
twenty
-
five
minutes
,
at
an
anti
-
slavery
meeting
at
the
Goat
and
Boots
---
the
enthusiasm
was
at
its
height
.
<EOS>
A
proposal
was
set
on
foot
for
presenting
the
curate
with
a
piece
of
plate
,
as
a
mark
of
esteem
for
his
valuable
services
rendered
to
the
parish
.
 
<EOS>
The
list
of
subscriptions
was
filled
up
in
no
time
;
the
contest
was
,
not
who
should
escape
the
contribution
,
but
who
should
be
the
foremost
to
subscribe
.
 
<EOS>
A
splendid
silver
inkstand
was
made
,
and
engraved
with
an
appropriate
inscription
;
the
curate
was
invited
to
a
public
breakfast
,
at
the
before
-
mentioned
Goat
and
Boots
;
the
inkstand
was
presented
in
a
neat
speech
by
Mr
Gubbins
,
the
ex
-
churchwarden
,
and
acknowledged
by
the
curate
in
terms
which
drew
tears
into
the
eyes
of
all
present
---
the
very
waiters
were
melted
.
   
<EOS>
One
would
have
supposed
that
,
by
this
time
,
the
theme
of
universal
admiration
was
lifted
to
the
very
pinnacle
of
popularity
.
 
<EOS>
No
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
The
curate
began
to
cough
;
four
fits
of
coughing
one
morning
between
the
Litany
and
the
Epistle
,
and
five
in
the
afternoon
service
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
a
discovery
---
the
curate
was
consumptive
.
 
<EOS>
How
interestingly
melancholy
!
 
<EOS>
If
the
young
ladies
were
energetic
before
,
their
sympathy
and
solicitude
now
knew
no
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
man
as
the
curate
---
such
a
dear
---
such
a
perfect
love
---
to
be
consumptive
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
Anonymous
presents
of
black
-
currant
jam
,
and
lozenges
,
elastic
waistcoats
,
bosom
friends
,
and
warm
stockings
,
poured
in
upon
the
curate
until
he
was
as
completely
fitted
out
with
winter
clothing
,
as
if
he
were
on
the
verge
of
an
expedition
to
the
North
Pole
:
 
verbal
bulletins
of
the
state
of
his
health
were
circulated
throughout
the
parish
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
a
day
;
and
the
curate
was
in
the
very
zenith
of
his
popularity
.
   
<EOS>
About
this
period
,
a
change
came
over
the
spirit
of
the
parish
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
quiet
,
respectable
,
dozing
old
gentleman
,
who
had
officiated
in
our
chapel
-
of
-
ease
for
twelve
years
previously
,
died
one
fine
morning
,
without
having
given
any
notice
whatever
of
his
intention
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
gave
rise
to
counter
-
sensation
the
first
;
and
the
arrival
of
his
successor
occasioned
counter
-
sensation
the
second
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
pale
,
thin
,
cadaverous
man
,
with
large
black
eyes
,
and
long
straggling
black
hair
:
 
his
dress
was
slovenly
in
the
extreme
,
his
manner
ungainly
,
his
doctrines
startling
;
in
short
,
he
was
in
every
respect
the
antipodes
of
the
curate
.
 
<EOS>
Crowds
of
our
female
parishioners
flocked
to
hear
him
;
at
first
,
because
he
was
SO
odd
-
looking
,
then
because
his
face
was
SO
expressive
,
then
because
he
preached
SO
well
;
and
at
last
,
because
they
really
thought
that
,
after
all
,
there
was
something
about
him
which
it
was
quite
impossible
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
curate
,
he
was
all
very
well
;
but
certainly
,
after
all
,
there
was
no
denying
that
---
that
---
in
short
,
the
curate
was
n't
a
novelty
,
and
the
other
clergyman
was
.
<EOS>
The
inconstancy
of
public
opinion
is
proverbial
:
 
the
congregation
migrated
one
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
curate
coughed
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
---
it
was
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
He
respired
with
difficulty
---
it
was
equally
ineffectual
in
awakening
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
Seats
are
once
again
to
be
had
in
any
part
of
our
parish
church
,
and
the
chapel
-
of
-
ease
is
going
to
be
enlarged
,
as
it
is
crowded
to
suffocation
every
Sunday
!
   
<EOS>
The
best
known
and
most
respected
among
our
parishioners
,
is
an
old
lady
,
who
resided
in
our
parish
long
before
our
name
was
registered
in
the
list
of
baptisms
.
 
<EOS>
Our
parish
is
a
suburban
one
,
and
the
old
lady
lives
in
a
neat
row
of
houses
in
the
most
airy
and
pleasant
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
is
her
own
;
and
it
,
and
everything
about
it
,
except
the
old
lady
herself
,
who
looks
a
little
older
than
she
did
ten
years
ago
,
is
in
just
the
same
state
as
when
the
old
gentleman
was
living
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
front
parlour
,
which
is
the
old
lady
's
ordinary
sitting
-
room
,
is
a
perfect
picture
of
quiet
neatness
;
the
carpet
is
covered
with
brown
Holland
,
the
glass
and
picture
-
frames
are
carefully
enveloped
in
yellow
muslin
;
the
table
-
covers
are
never
taken
off
,
except
when
the
leaves
are
turpentined
and
bees'-waxed
,
an
operation
which
is
regularly
commenced
every
other
morning
at
half
-
past
nine
o'clock
---
and
the
little
nicknacks
are
always
arranged
in
precisely
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
these
are
presents
from
little
girls
whose
parents
live
in
the
same
row
;
but
some
of
them
,
such
as
the
two
old
-
fashioned
watches
(
which
never
keep
the
same
time
,
one
being
always
a
quarter
of
an
hour
too
slow
,
and
the
other
a
quarter
of
an
hour
too
fast
)
,
the
little
picture
of
the
Princess
Charlotte
and
Prince
Leopold
as
they
appeared
in
the
Royal
Box
at
Drury
Lane
Theatre
,
and
others
of
the
same
class
,
have
been
in
the
old
lady
's
possession
for
many
years
.
<EOS>
Here
the
old
lady
sits
with
her
spectacles
on
,
busily
engaged
in
needlework
---
near
the
window
in
summer
time
;
and
if
she
sees
you
coming
up
the
steps
,
and
you
happen
to
be
a
favourite
,
she
trots
out
to
open
the
street
-
door
for
you
before
you
knock
,
and
as
you
must
be
fatigued
after
that
hot
walk
,
insists
on
your
swallowing
two
glasses
of
sherry
before
you
exert
yourself
by
talking
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
call
in
the
evening
you
will
find
her
cheerful
,
but
rather
more
serious
than
usual
,
with
an
open
Bible
on
the
table
,
before
her
,
of
which
"
Sarah
,
"
who
is
just
as
neat
and
methodical
as
her
mistress
,
regularly
reads
two
or
three
chapters
in
the
parlour
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
sees
scarcely
any
company
,
except
the
little
girls
before
noticed
,
each
of
whom
has
always
a
regular
fixed
day
for
a
periodical
tea
-
drinking
with
her
,
to
which
the
child
looks
forward
as
the
greatest
treat
of
its
existence
.
 
<EOS>
She
seldom
visits
at
a
greater
distance
than
the
next
door
but
one
on
either
side
;
and
when
she
drinks
tea
here
,
Sarah
runs
out
first
and
knocks
a
double
-
knock
,
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
her
"
Missis
's
"
catching
cold
by
having
to
wait
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
very
scrupulous
in
returning
these
little
invitations
,
and
when
she
asks
Mr
and
Mrs
So
-
and
-
so
,
to
meet
Mr
and
Mrs
Somebody
-
else
,
Sarah
and
she
dust
the
urn
,
and
the
best
china
tea
-
service
,
and
the
Pope
Joan
board
;
and
the
visitors
are
received
in
the
drawing
-
room
in
great
state
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
but
few
relations
,
and
they
are
scattered
about
in
different
parts
of
the
country
,
and
she
seldom
sees
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
a
son
in
India
,
whom
she
always
describes
to
you
as
a
fine
,
handsome
fellow
---
<EOS>
so
like
the
profile
of
his
poor
dear
father
over
the
sideboard
,
but
the
old
lady
adds
,
with
a
mournful
shake
of
the
head
,
that
he
has
always
been
one
of
her
greatest
trials
;
and
that
indeed
he
once
almost
broke
her
heart
;
but
it
pleased
God
to
enable
her
to
get
the
better
of
it
,
and
she
would
prefer
your
never
mentioning
the
subject
to
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
a
great
number
of
pensioners
:
 
and
on
Saturday
,
after
she
comes
back
from
market
,
there
is
a
regular
levee
of
old
men
and
women
in
the
passage
,
waiting
for
their
weekly
gratuity
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
always
heads
the
list
of
any
benevolent
subscriptions
,
and
hers
are
always
the
most
liberal
donations
to
the
Winter
Coal
and
Soup
Distribution
Society
.
 
<EOS>
She
subscribed
twenty
pounds
towards
the
erection
of
an
organ
in
our
parish
church
,
and
was
so
overcome
the
first
Sunday
the
children
sang
to
it
,
that
she
was
obliged
to
be
carried
out
by
the
pew
-
opener
.
 
<EOS>
Her
entrance
into
church
on
Sunday
is
always
the
signal
for
a
little
bustle
in
the
side
aisle
,
occasioned
by
a
general
rise
among
the
poor
people
,
who
bow
and
curtsey
until
the
pew
-
opener
has
ushered
the
old
lady
into
her
accustomed
seat
,
dropped
a
respectful
curtsey
,
and
shut
the
door
:
 
and
the
same
ceremony
is
repeated
on
her
leaving
church
,
when
she
walks
home
with
the
family
next
door
but
one
,
and
talks
about
the
sermon
all
the
way
,
invariably
opening
the
conversation
by
asking
the
youngest
boy
where
the
text
was
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
with
the
annual
variation
of
a
trip
to
some
quiet
place
on
the
sea
-
coast
,
passes
the
old
lady
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
rolled
on
in
the
same
unvarying
and
benevolent
course
for
many
years
now
,
and
must
at
no
distant
period
be
brought
to
its
final
close
.
 
<EOS>
She
looks
forward
to
its
termination
,
with
calmness
and
without
apprehension
.
<EOS>
She
has
everything
to
hope
and
nothing
to
fear
.
   
<EOS>
A
very
different
personage
,
but
one
who
has
rendered
himself
very
conspicuous
in
our
parish
,
is
one
of
the
old
lady
's
next
-
door
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
an
old
naval
officer
on
half
-
pay
,
and
his
bluff
and
unceremonious
behaviour
disturbs
the
old
lady
's
domestic
economy
,
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
WILL
smoke
cigars
in
the
front
court
,
and
when
he
wants
something
to
drink
with
them
---
which
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
circumstance
---
he
lifts
up
the
old
lady
's
knocker
with
his
walking
-
stick
,
and
demands
to
have
a
glass
of
table
ale
,
handed
over
the
rails
.
 
<EOS>
In
addition
to
this
cool
proceeding
,
he
is
a
bit
of
a
Jack
of
all
trades
,
or
to
use
his
own
words
,
"
a
regular
Robinson
Crusoe
;
"
and
nothing
delights
him
better
than
to
experimentalise
on
the
old
lady
's
property
.
 
<EOS>
One
morning
he
got
up
early
,
and
planted
three
or
four
roots
of
full
-
grown
marigolds
in
every
bed
of
her
front
garden
,
to
the
inconceivable
astonishment
of
the
old
lady
,
who
actually
thought
when
she
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
,
that
it
was
some
strange
eruption
which
had
come
out
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Another
time
he
took
to
pieces
the
eight
-
day
clock
on
the
front
landing
,
under
pretence
of
cleaning
the
works
,
which
he
put
together
again
,
by
some
undiscovered
process
,
in
so
wonderful
a
manner
,
that
the
large
hand
has
done
nothing
but
trip
up
the
little
one
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
took
to
breeding
silk
-
worms
,
which
he
WOULD
bring
in
two
or
three
times
a
day
,
in
little
paper
boxes
,
to
show
the
old
lady
,
generally
dropping
a
worm
or
two
at
every
visit
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
,
that
one
morning
a
very
stout
silk
-
worm
was
discovered
in
the
act
of
walking
up
-
stairs
---
probably
with
the
view
of
inquiring
after
his
friends
,
for
,
on
further
inspection
,
it
appeared
that
some
of
his
companions
had
already
found
their
way
to
every
room
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
old
lady
went
to
the
seaside
in
despair
,
and
during
her
absence
he
completely
effaced
the
name
from
her
brass
door
-
plate
,
in
his
attempts
to
polish
it
with
aqua
-
fortis
.
   
<EOS>
But
all
this
is
nothing
to
his
seditious
conduct
in
public
life
.
<EOS>
He
attends
every
vestry
meeting
that
is
held
;
always
opposes
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
parish
,
denounces
the
profligacy
of
the
churchwardens
,
contests
legal
points
against
the
vestry
-
clerk
,
will
make
the
tax
-
gatherer
call
for
his
money
till
he
wo
n't
call
any
longer
,
and
then
he
sends
it
:
 
<EOS>
finds
fault
with
the
sermon
every
Sunday
<EOS>
,
says
that
the
organist
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
,
offers
to
back
himself
for
any
amount
to
sing
the
psalms
better
than
all
the
children
put
together
,
male
and
female
;
and
,
in
short
,
conducts
himself
in
the
most
turbulent
and
uproarious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
of
it
is
,
that
having
a
high
regard
for
the
old
lady
,
he
wants
to
make
her
a
convert
to
his
views
,
and
therefore
walks
into
her
little
parlour
with
his
newspaper
in
his
hand
,
and
talks
violent
politics
by
the
hour
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
charitable
,
open
-
hearted
old
fellow
at
bottom
,
after
all
;
so
,
although
he
puts
the
old
lady
a
little
out
occasionally
,
they
agree
very
well
in
the
main
,
and
she
laughs
as
much
at
each
feat
of
his
handiwork
when
it
is
all
over
,
as
anybody
else
.
   
<EOS>
The
four
sisters
<EOS>
The
row
of
houses
in
which
the
old
lady
and
her
troublesome
neighbour
reside
,
comprises
,
beyond
all
doubt
,
a
greater
number
of
characters
within
its
circumscribed
limits
,
than
all
the
rest
of
the
parish
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
can
not
,
consistently
with
our
present
plan
,
however
,
extend
the
number
of
our
parochial
sketches
beyond
six
,
it
will
be
better
perhaps
,
to
select
the
most
peculiar
,
and
to
introduce
them
at
once
without
further
preface
.
   
<EOS>
The
four
Miss
Willises
,
then
,
settled
in
our
parish
thirteen
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
melancholy
reflection
that
the
old
adage
,
"
time
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
,
"
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
fairer
portion
of
the
creation
;
and
willingly
would
we
conceal
the
fact
,
that
even
thirteen
years
ago
the
Miss
Willises
were
far
from
juvenile
.
 
<EOS>
Our
duty
as
faithful
parochial
chroniclers
,
however
,
is
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
,
and
we
are
bound
to
state
,
that
thirteen
years
since
,
the
authorities
in
matrimonial
cases
,
considered
the
youngest
Miss
Willis
in
a
very
precarious
state
,
while
the
eldest
sister
was
positively
given
over
,
as
being
far
beyond
all
human
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
the
Miss
Willises
took
a
lease
of
the
house
;
it
was
fresh
painted
and
papered
from
top
to
bottom
:
 
the
paint
inside
was
all
wainscoted
,
the
marble
all
cleaned
,
the
old
grates
taken
down
,
and
register
-
stoves
,
you
could
see
to
dress
by
,
put
up
;
four
trees
were
planted
in
the
back
garden
,
several
small
baskets
of
gravel
sprinkled
over
the
front
one
,
vans
of
elegant
furniture
arrived
,
spring
blinds
were
fitted
to
the
windows
,
carpenters
who
had
been
employed
in
the
various
preparations
,
alterations
,
and
repairs
,
made
confidential
statements
to
the
different
maid
-
servants
in
the
row
,
relative
to
the
magnificent
scale
on
which
the
Miss
Willises
were
commencing
;
the
maid
-
servants
told
their
"
Missises
,
"
the
Missises
told
their
friends
,
and
vague
rumours
were
circulated
throughout
the
parish
,
that
No
.
25
,
in
Gordon
-
place
,
had
been
taken
by
four
maiden
ladies
of
immense
property
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
Miss
Willises
moved
in
;
and
then
the
"
calling
"
began
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
the
perfection
of
neatness
---
so
were
the
four
Miss
Willises
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
formal
,
stiff
,
and
cold
---
so
were
the
four
Miss
Willises
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
single
chair
of
the
whole
set
was
ever
seen
out
of
its
place
---
not
a
single
Miss
Willis
of
the
whole
four
was
ever
seen
out
of
hers
.
 
<EOS>
There
they
always
sat
,
in
the
same
places
,
doing
precisely
the
same
things
at
the
same
hour
.
 
<EOS>
The
eldest
Miss
Willis
used
to
knit
,
the
second
to
draw
,
the
two
others
to
play
duets
on
the
piano
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
have
no
separate
existence
,
but
to
have
made
up
their
minds
just
to
winter
through
life
together
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
three
long
graces
in
drapery
,
with
the
addition
,
like
a
school
-
dinner
,
of
another
long
grace
afterwards
---
<EOS>
the
three
fates
with
another
sister
---
the
Siamese
twins
multiplied
by
two
.
 
<EOS>
The
eldest
Miss
Willis
grew
bilious
---
the
four
Miss
Willises
grew
bilious
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
The
eldest
Miss
Willis
grew
ill
-
tempered
and
religious
---
the
four
Miss
Willises
were
ill
-
tempered
and
religious
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
the
eldest
did
,
the
others
did
,
and
whatever
anybody
else
did
,
they
all
disapproved
of
;
and
thus
they
vegetated
---
living
in
Polar
harmony
among
themselves
,
and
,
as
they
sometimes
went
out
,
or
saw
company
"
in
a
quiet
-
way
"
at
home
,
occasionally
icing
the
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
Three
years
passed
over
in
this
way
,
when
an
unlooked
for
and
extraordinary
phenomenon
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
The
Miss
Willises
showed
symptoms
of
summer
,
the
frost
gradually
broke
up
;
a
complete
thaw
took
place
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
?
<EOS>
one
of
the
four
Miss
Willises
was
going
to
be
married
!
   
<EOS>
Now
,
where
on
earth
the
husband
came
from
,
by
what
feelings
the
poor
man
could
have
been
actuated
,
or
by
what
process
of
reasoning
the
four
Miss
Willises
succeeded
in
persuading
themselves
that
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
marry
one
of
them
,
without
marrying
them
all
,
are
questions
too
profound
for
us
to
resolve
:
 
certain
it
is
,
however
,
that
the
visits
of
Mr
Robinson
(
a
gentleman
in
a
public
office
,
with
a
good
salary
and
a
little
property
of
his
own
,
besides
)
were
received
---
that
the
four
Miss
Willises
were
courted
in
due
form
by
the
said
Mr
Robinson
---
that
the
neighbours
were
perfectly
frantic
in
their
anxiety
to
discover
which
of
the
four
Miss
Willises
was
the
fortunate
fair
,
and
that
the
difficulty
they
experienced
in
solving
the
problem
was
not
at
all
lessened
by
the
announcement
of
the
eldest
Miss
Willis
,
---
"
WE
are
going
to
marry
Mr
Robinson
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
very
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
so
completely
identified
,
the
one
with
the
other
,
that
the
curiosity
of
the
whole
row
---
even
of
the
old
lady
herself
---
was
roused
almost
beyond
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
The
subject
was
discussed
at
every
little
card
-
table
and
tea
-
drinking
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
of
silk
-
worm
notoriety
did
not
hesitate
to
express
his
decided
opinion
that
Mr
Robinson
was
of
Eastern
descent
,
and
contemplated
marrying
the
whole
family
at
once
;
and
the
row
,
generally
,
shook
their
heads
with
considerable
gravity
,
and
declared
the
business
to
be
very
mysterious
.
 
<EOS>
They
hoped
it
might
all
end
well
;
---
it
certainly
had
a
very
singular
appearance
,
but
still
it
would
be
uncharitable
to
express
any
opinion
without
good
grounds
to
go
upon
,
and
certainly
the
Miss
Willises
were
QUITE
old
enough
to
judge
for
themselves
,
and
to
be
sure
people
ought
to
know
their
own
business
best
,
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
,
one
fine
morning
,
at
a
quarter
before
eight
o'clock
,
AM^
,
two
glass
-
coaches
drove
up
to
the
Miss
Willises
'
door
,
at
which
Mr
Robinson
had
arrived
in
a
cab
ten
minutes
before
,
dressed
in
a
light
-
blue
coat
and
double
-
milled
kersey
pantaloons
,
white
neckerchief
,
pumps
,
and
dress
-
gloves
,
his
manner
denoting
,
as
appeared
from
the
evidence
of
the
housemaid
at
No
.
23
,
who
was
sweeping
the
door
-
steps
at
the
time
,
a
considerable
degree
of
nervous
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
also
hastily
reported
on
the
same
testimony
,
that
the
cook
who
opened
the
door
,
wore
a
large
white
bow
of
unusual
dimensions
,
in
a
much
smarter
head
-
dress
than
the
regulation
cap
to
which
the
Miss
Willises
invariably
restricted
the
somewhat
excursive
tastes
of
female
servants
in
general
.
   
<EOS>
The
intelligence
spread
rapidly
from
house
to
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
clear
that
the
eventful
morning
had
at
length
arrived
;
the
whole
row
stationed
themselves
behind
their
first
and
second
floor
blinds
,
and
waited
the
result
in
breathless
expectation
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
the
Miss
Willises
'
door
opened
;
the
door
of
the
first
glass
-
coach
did
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Two
gentlemen
,
and
a
pair
of
ladies
to
correspond
---
friends
of
the
family
,
no
doubt
<EOS>
;
up
went
the
steps
,
bang
went
the
door
,
off
went
the
first
class
-
coach
,
and
up
came
the
second
.
   
<EOS>
The
street
door
opened
again
;
the
excitement
of
the
whole
row
increased
---
<EOS>
Mr
Robinson
and
the
eldest
Miss
Willis
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
,
"
said
the
lady
at
No
.
19
;
"
I
always
said
it
was
MISS
Willis
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
Well
,
I
never
!
"
ejaculated
the
young
lady
at
No
.
18
to
the
young
lady
at
No
.
17
.
<EOS>
---
"
Did
you
ever
,
dear
!
"
responded
the
young
lady
at
No
.
17
to
the
young
lady
at
No
.
18
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
too
ridiculous
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
a
spinster
of
an
UNcertain
age
,
at
No
.
16
,
joining
in
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
shall
portray
the
astonishment
of
Gordon
-
place
,
when
Mr
Robinson
handed
in
ALL
the
Miss
Willises
,
one
after
the
other
,
and
then
squeezed
himself
into
an
acute
angle
of
the
glass
-
coach
,
which
forthwith
proceeded
at
a
brisk
pace
,
after
the
other
glass
-
coach
,
which
other
glass
-
coach
had
itself
proceeded
,
at
a
brisk
pace
,
in
the
direction
of
the
parish
church
!
 
<EOS>
Who
shall
depict
the
perplexity
of
the
clergyman
,
when
ALL
the
Miss
Willises
knelt
down
at
the
communion
-
table
,
and
repeated
the
responses
incidental
to
the
marriage
service
in
an
audible
voice
---
or
who
shall
describe
the
confusion
which
prevailed
,
when
---
even
after
the
difficulties
thus
occasioned
had
been
adjusted
---
ALL
the
Miss
Willises
went
into
hysterics
at
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremony
,
until
the
sacred
edifice
resounded
with
their
united
wailings
!
   
<EOS>
As
the
four
sisters
and
Mr
Robinson
continued
to
occupy
the
same
house
after
this
memorable
occasion
,
and
as
the
married
sister
,
whoever
she
was
,
never
appeared
in
public
without
the
other
three
,
we
are
not
quite
clear
that
the
neighbours
ever
would
have
discovered
the
real
Mrs
Robinson
,
but
for
a
circumstance
of
the
most
gratifying
description
,
which
WILL
happen
occasionally
in
the
best
-
regulated
families
.
 
<EOS>
Three
quarter
-
days
elapsed
,
and
the
row
,
on
whom
a
new
light
appeared
to
have
been
bursting
for
some
time
,
began
to
speak
with
a
sort
of
implied
confidence
on
the
subject
,
and
to
wonder
how
Mrs
Robinson
---
the
youngest
Miss
Willis
that
was
---
got
on
;
and
servants
might
be
seen
running
up
the
steps
,
about
nine
or
ten
o'clock
every
morning
,
with
"
Missis
's
compliments
,
and
wishes
to
know
how
Mrs
Robinson
finds
herself
this
morning
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
answer
always
was
,
"
Mrs
Robinson
's
compliments
,
and
she
's
in
very
good
spirits
,
and
does
n't
find
herself
any
worse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
piano
was
heard
no
longer
,
the
knitting
-
needles
were
laid
aside
,
drawing
was
neglected
,
and
mantua
-
making
and
millinery
,
on
the
smallest
scale
imaginable
,
appeared
to
have
become
the
favourite
amusement
of
the
whole
family
.
 
<EOS>
The
parlour
was
n't
quite
as
tidy
as
it
used
to
be
,
and
if
you
called
in
the
morning
,
you
would
see
lying
on
a
table
,
with
an
old
newspaper
carelessly
thrown
over
them
,
two
or
three
particularly
small
caps
,
rather
larger
than
if
they
had
been
made
for
a
moderate
-
sized
doll
,
with
a
small
piece
of
lace
,
in
the
shape
of
a
horse
-
shoe
,
let
in
behind
:
 
or
perhaps
a
white
robe
,
not
very
large
in
circumference
,
but
very
much
out
of
proportion
in
point
of
length
,
with
a
little
tucker
round
the
top
,
and
a
frill
round
the
bottom
;
and
once
when
we
called
,
we
saw
a
long
white
roller
,
with
a
kind
of
blue
margin
down
each
side
,
the
probable
use
of
which
,
we
were
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
Then
we
fancied
that
Dr
Dawson
,
the
surgeon
,
&
c
,
who
displays
a
large
lamp
with
a
different
colour
in
every
pane
of
glass
,
at
the
corner
of
the
row
,
began
to
be
knocked
up
at
night
oftener
than
he
used
to
be
;
and
once
we
were
very
much
alarmed
by
hearing
a
hackney
-
coach
stop
at
Mrs
Robinson
's
door
,
at
half
-
past
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
out
of
which
there
emerged
a
fat
old
woman
,
in
a
cloak
and
night
-
cap
,
with
a
bundle
in
one
hand
,
and
a
pair
of
pattens
in
the
other
,
who
looked
as
if
she
had
been
suddenly
knocked
up
out
of
bed
for
some
very
special
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
got
up
in
the
morning
we
saw
that
the
knocker
was
tied
up
in
an
old
white
kid
glove
;
and
we
,
in
our
innocence
(
we
were
in
a
state
of
bachelorship
then
)
,
wondered
what
on
earth
it
all
meant
,
until
we
heard
the
eldest
Miss
Willis
,
IN
PROPRIA
PERSONA
say
,
with
great
dignity
,
in
answer
to
the
next
inquiry
,
"
MY
compliments
,
and
Mrs
Robinson
's
doing
as
well
as
can
be
expected
,
and
the
little
girl
thrives
wonderfully
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
row
,
our
curiosity
was
satisfied
,
and
we
began
to
wonder
it
had
never
occurred
to
us
what
the
matter
was
,
before
.

The
election
for
beadle
A
great
event
has
recently
occurred
in
our
parish
.
 
<EOS>
A
contest
of
paramount
interest
has
just
terminated
;
a
parochial
convulsion
has
taken
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
succeeded
by
a
glorious
triumph
,
which
the
country
---
or
at
least
the
parish
---
it
is
all
the
same
---
will
long
remember
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
an
election
;
an
election
for
beadle
.
<EOS>
The
supporters
of
the
old
beadle
system
have
been
defeated
in
their
stronghold
,
and
the
advocates
of
the
great
new
beadle
principles
have
achieved
a
proud
victory
.
   
<EOS>
Our
parish
,
which
,
like
all
other
parishes
,
is
a
little
world
of
its
own
,
has
long
been
divided
into
two
parties
,
whose
contentions
,
slumbering
for
a
while
,
have
never
failed
to
burst
forth
with
unabated
vigour
,
on
any
occasion
on
which
they
could
by
possibility
be
renewed
.
 
<EOS>
Watching
-
rates
,
lighting
-
rates
,
paving
-
rates
,
sewer's
-
rates
,
church
-
rates
,
poor's
-
rates
---
all
sorts
of
rates
,
have
been
in
their
turns
the
subjects
of
a
grand
struggle
;
and
as
to
questions
of
patronage
,
the
asperity
and
determination
with
which
they
have
been
contested
is
scarcely
credible
.
   
<EOS>
The
leader
of
the
official
party
---
the
steady
advocate
of
the
churchwardens
,
and
the
unflinching
supporter
of
the
overseers
---
is
an
old
gentleman
who
lives
in
our
row
.
 
<EOS>
He
owns
some
half
a
dozen
houses
in
it
,
and
always
walks
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
so
that
he
may
be
able
to
take
in
a
view
of
the
whole
of
his
property
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
tall
,
thin
,
bony
man
,
with
an
interrogative
nose
,
and
little
restless
perking
eyes
,
which
appear
to
have
been
given
him
for
the
sole
purpose
of
peeping
into
other
people
's
affairs
with
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
deeply
impressed
with
the
importance
of
our
parish
business
,
and
prides
himself
,
not
a
little
,
on
his
style
of
addressing
the
parishioners
in
vestry
assembled
.
 
<EOS>
His
views
are
rather
confined
than
extensive
;
his
principles
more
narrow
than
liberal
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
heard
to
declaim
very
loudly
in
favour
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
,
and
advocates
the
repeal
of
the
stamp
duty
on
newspapers
,
because
the
daily
journals
who
now
have
a
monopoly
of
the
public
,
never
give
VERBATIM
reports
of
vestry
meetings
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
appear
egotistical
for
the
world
,
but
at
the
same
time
he
must
say
,
that
there
are
SPEECHES
---
that
celebrated
speech
of
his
own
,
on
the
emoluments
of
the
sexton
,
and
the
duties
of
the
office
,
for
instance
---
which
might
be
communicated
to
the
public
,
greatly
to
their
improvement
and
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
His
great
opponent
in
public
life
is
Captain
Purday
,
the
old
naval
officer
on
half
-
pay
,
to
whom
we
have
already
introduced
our
readers
.
 
<EOS>
The
captain
being
a
determined
opponent
of
the
constituted
authorities
,
whoever
they
may
chance
to
be
,
and
our
other
friend
being
their
steady
supporter
,
with
an
equal
disregard
of
their
individual
merits
<EOS>
,
it
will
readily
be
supposed
,
that
occasions
for
their
coming
into
direct
collision
are
neither
few
nor
far
between
.
 
<EOS>
They
divided
the
vestry
fourteen
times
on
a
motion
for
heating
the
church
with
warm
water
instead
of
coals
:
and
made
speeches
about
liberty
and
expenditure
,
and
prodigality
and
hot
water
,
which
threw
the
whole
parish
into
a
state
of
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
captain
,
when
he
was
on
the
visiting
committee
,
and
his
opponent
overseer
,
brought
forward
certain
distinct
and
specific
charges
relative
to
the
management
of
the
workhouse
,
boldly
expressed
his
total
want
of
confidence
in
the
existing
authorities
,
and
moved
for
"
a
copy
of
the
recipe
by
which
the
paupers
'
soup
was
prepared
,
together
with
any
documents
relating
thereto
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
the
overseer
steadily
resisted
;
he
fortified
himself
by
precedent
,
appealed
to
the
established
usage
,
and
declined
to
produce
the
papers
,
on
the
ground
of
the
injury
that
would
be
done
to
the
public
service
,
if
documents
of
a
strictly
private
nature
,
passing
between
the
master
of
the
workhouse
and
the
cook
,
were
to
be
thus
dragged
to
light
on
the
motion
of
any
individual
member
of
the
vestry
.
 
<EOS>
The
motion
was
lost
by
a
majority
of
two
;
and
then
the
captain
,
who
never
allows
himself
to
be
defeated
,
moved
for
a
committee
of
inquiry
into
the
whole
subject
.
 
<EOS>
The
affair
grew
serious
:
 
<EOS>
the
question
was
discussed
at
meeting
after
meeting
,
and
vestry
after
vestry
;
speeches
were
made
,
attacks
repudiated
,
personal
defiances
exchanged
,
explanations
received
,
and
the
greatest
excitement
prevailed
,
until
at
last
,
just
as
the
question
was
going
to
be
finally
decided
,
the
vestry
found
that
somehow
or
other
,
they
had
become
entangled
in
a
point
of
form
,
from
which
it
was
impossible
to
escape
with
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
motion
was
dropped
,
and
everybody
looked
extremely
important
,
and
seemed
quite
satisfied
with
the
meritorious
nature
of
the
whole
proceeding
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
state
of
affairs
in
our
parish
a
week
or
two
since
,
when
Simmons
,
the
beadle
,
suddenly
died
.
 
<EOS>
The
lamented
deceased
had
over
-
exerted
himself
,
a
day
or
two
previously
,
in
conveying
an
aged
female
,
highly
intoxicated
,
to
the
strong
room
of
the
work
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
thus
occasioned
,
added
to
a
severe
cold
,
which
this
indefatigable
officer
had
caught
in
his
capacity
of
director
of
the
parish
engine
,
by
inadvertently
playing
over
himself
instead
of
a
fire
,
proved
too
much
for
a
constitution
already
enfeebled
by
age
;
and
the
intelligence
was
conveyed
to
the
Board
one
evening
that
Simmons
had
died
,
and
left
his
respects
.
   
<EOS>
The
breath
was
scarcely
out
of
the
body
of
the
deceased
functionary
,
when
the
field
was
filled
with
competitors
for
the
vacant
office
,
each
of
whom
rested
his
claims
to
public
support
,
entirely
on
the
number
and
extent
of
his
family
,
as
if
the
office
of
beadle
were
originally
instituted
as
an
encouragement
for
the
propagation
of
the
human
species
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>

<EOS>
Such
were
the
placards
in
large
black
letters
on
a
white
ground
,
which
were
plentifully
pasted
on
the
walls
,
and
posted
in
the
windows
of
the
principal
shops
.
 
<EOS>
Timkins
's
success
was
considered
certain
:
several
mothers
of
families
half
promised
their
votes
,
and
the
nine
small
children
would
have
run
over
the
course
,
but
for
the
production
of
another
placard
,
announcing
the
appearance
of
a
still
more
meritorious
candidate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spruggins
for
Beadle
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
small
children
(
two
of
them
twins
)
,
and
a
wife
!
!
!
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
resisting
this
;
ten
small
children
would
have
been
almost
irresistible
in
themselves
,
without
the
twins
,
but
the
touching
parenthesis
about
that
interesting
production
of
nature
,
and
the
still
more
touching
allusion
to
Mrs
Spruggins
,
must
ensure
success
.
 
<EOS>
Spruggins
was
the
favourite
at
once
,
and
the
appearance
of
his
lady
,
as
she
went
about
to
solicit
votes
(
which
encouraged
confident
hopes
of
a
still
further
addition
to
the
house
of
Spruggins
at
no
remote
period
)
,
increased
the
general
prepossession
in
his
favour
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
candidates
,
Bung
alone
excepted
,
resigned
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
of
election
was
fixed
;
and
the
canvass
proceeded
with
briskness
and
perseverance
on
both
sides
.
   
<EOS>
The
members
of
the
vestry
could
not
be
supposed
to
escape
the
contagious
excitement
inseparable
from
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
The
majority
of
the
lady
inhabitants
of
the
parish
declared
at
once
for
Spruggins
;
and
the
QUONDAM
overseer
took
the
same
side
,
on
the
ground
that
men
with
large
families
always
had
been
elected
to
the
office
,
and
that
although
he
must
admit
,
that
,
in
other
respects
,
Spruggins
was
the
least
qualified
candidate
of
the
two
,
still
it
was
an
old
practice
,
and
he
saw
no
reason
why
an
old
practice
should
be
departed
from
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
enough
for
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
sided
with
Bung
,
canvassed
for
him
personally
in
all
directions
,
wrote
squibs
on
Spruggins
,
and
got
his
butcher
to
skewer
them
up
on
conspicuous
joints
in
his
shop
-
front
;
frightened
his
neighbour
,
the
old
lady
,
into
a
palpitation
of
the
heart
,
by
his
awful
denunciations
of
Spruggins
's
party
;
and
bounced
in
and
out
,
and
up
and
down
,
and
backwards
and
forwards
,
until
all
the
sober
inhabitants
of
the
parish
thought
it
inevitable
that
he
must
die
of
a
brain
fever
,
long
before
the
election
began
.
   
<EOS>
The
day
of
election
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
an
individual
struggle
,
but
a
party
contest
between
the
ins
and
outs
.
 
<EOS>
The
question
was
,
whether
the
withering
influence
of
the
overseers
,
the
domination
of
the
churchwardens
,
and
the
blighting
despotism
of
the
vestry
-
clerk
,
should
be
allowed
to
render
the
election
of
beadle
a
form
---
a
nullity
:
 
whether
they
should
impose
a
vestry
-
elected
beadle
on
the
parish
,
to
do
their
bidding
and
forward
their
views
,
or
whether
the
parishioners
,
fearlessly
asserting
their
undoubted
rights
,
should
elect
an
independent
beadle
of
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
The
nomination
was
fixed
to
take
place
in
the
vestry
,
but
so
great
was
the
throng
of
anxious
spectators
,
that
it
was
found
necessary
to
adjourn
to
the
church
,
where
the
ceremony
commenced
with
due
solemnity
.
 
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
churchwardens
and
overseers
,
and
the
ex
-
churchwardens
and
ex
-
overseers
,
with
Spruggins
in
the
rear
,
excited
general
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Spruggins
was
a
little
thin
man
,
in
rusty
black
,
with
a
long
pale
face
,
and
a
countenance
expressive
of
care
and
fatigue
,
which
might
either
be
attributed
to
the
extent
of
his
family
or
the
anxiety
of
his
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
His
opponent
appeared
in
a
cast
-
off
coat
of
the
captain
's
---
a
blue
coat
with
bright
buttons
;
white
trousers
,
and
that
description
of
shoes
familiarly
known
by
the
appellation
of
"
high
-
lows
.
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
serenity
in
the
open
countenance
of
Bung
---
a
kind
of
moral
dignity
in
his
confident
air
---
<EOS>
an
"
I
wish
you
may
get
it
"
sort
of
expression
in
his
eye
---
which
infused
animation
into
his
supporters
,
and
evidently
dispirited
his
opponents
.
   
<EOS>
The
ex
-
churchwarden
rose
to
propose
Thomas
Spruggins
for
beadle
.
<EOS>
He
had
known
him
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
his
eye
upon
him
closely
for
years
;
he
had
watched
him
with
twofold
vigilance
for
months
.
 
<EOS>
(
A
parishioner
here
suggested
that
this
might
be
termed
"
taking
a
double
sight
,
"
but
the
observation
was
drowned
in
loud
cries
of
"
Order
!
"
)
 
<EOS>
He
would
repeat
that
he
had
had
his
eye
upon
him
for
years
,
and
this
he
would
say
,
that
a
more
well
-
conducted
,
a
more
well
-
behaved
,
a
more
sober
,
a
more
quiet
man
,
with
a
more
well
-
regulated
mind
,
he
had
never
met
with
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
with
a
larger
family
he
had
never
known
(
cheers
)
.
 
<EOS>
The
parish
required
a
man
who
could
be
depended
on
(
"
Hear
!
"
<EOS>
from
the
Spruggins
side
,
answered
by
ironical
cheers
from
the
Bung
party
)
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
man
he
now
proposed
(
"
No
,
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
"
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
allude
to
individuals
(
the
ex
-
churchwarden
continued
,
in
the
celebrated
negative
style
adopted
by
great
speakers
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
advert
to
a
gentleman
who
had
once
held
a
high
rank
in
the
service
of
his
majesty
;
he
would
not
say
,
that
that
gentleman
was
no
gentleman
;
he
would
not
assert
,
that
that
man
was
no
man
;
he
would
not
say
,
that
he
was
a
turbulent
parishioner
;
he
would
not
say
,
that
he
had
grossly
misbehaved
himself
,
not
only
on
this
,
but
on
all
former
occasions
;
he
would
not
say
,
that
he
was
one
of
those
discontented
and
treasonable
spirits
,
who
carried
confusion
and
disorder
wherever
they
went
;
he
would
not
say
,
that
he
harboured
in
his
heart
envy
,
and
hatred
,
and
malice
,
and
all
uncharitableness
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
He
wished
to
have
everything
comfortable
and
pleasant
,
and
therefore
,
he
would
say
---
nothing
about
him
(
cheers
)
.
   
<EOS>
The
captain
replied
in
a
similar
parliamentary
style
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
say
,
he
was
astonished
at
the
speech
they
had
just
heard
<EOS>
;
he
would
not
say
,
he
was
disgusted
(
cheers
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
retort
the
epithets
which
had
been
hurled
against
him
(
renewed
cheering
)
;
he
would
not
allude
to
men
once
in
office
,
but
now
happily
out
of
it
,
who
had
mismanaged
the
workhouse
,
ground
the
paupers
,
diluted
the
beer
,
slack
-
baked
the
bread
,
boned
the
meat
,
heightened
the
work
,
and
lowered
the
soup
(
tremendous
cheers
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
ask
what
such
men
deserved
(
a
voice
,
"
Nothing
a
-
day
,
and
find
themselves
!
"
)
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
say
,
that
one
burst
of
general
indignation
should
drive
them
from
the
parish
they
polluted
with
their
presence
<EOS>
(
"
Give
it
him
!
"
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
allude
to
the
unfortunate
man
who
had
been
proposed
---
he
would
not
say
,
as
the
vestry
's
tool
,
but
as
Beadle
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
advert
to
that
individual
's
family
;
he
would
not
say
,
that
nine
children
,
twins
,
and
a
wife
,
were
very
bad
examples
for
pauper
imitation
(
loud
cheers
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
advert
in
detail
to
the
qualifications
of
Bung
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
stood
before
him
,
and
he
would
not
say
in
his
presence
,
what
he
might
be
disposed
to
say
of
him
,
if
he
were
absent
.
 
<EOS>
(
Here
Mr
Bung
telegraphed
to
a
friend
near
him
,
under
cover
of
his
hat
,
by
contracting
his
left
eye
,
and
applying
his
right
thumb
to
the
tip
of
his
nose
)
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
objected
to
Bung
that
he
had
only
five
children
(
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
<EOS>
from
the
opposition
)
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
the
legislature
had
affixed
any
precise
amount
of
infantine
qualification
to
the
office
of
beadle
;
but
taking
it
for
granted
that
an
extensive
family
were
a
great
requisite
,
he
entreated
them
to
look
to
facts
,
and
compare
DATA
,
about
which
there
could
be
no
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
Bung
was
35
years
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
Spruggins
---
of
whom
he
wished
to
speak
with
all
possible
respect
---
was
50
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
not
more
than
possible
---
was
it
not
very
probable
---
that
by
the
time
Bung
attained
the
latter
age
,
he
might
see
around
him
a
family
,
even
exceeding
in
number
and
extent
,
that
to
which
Spruggins
at
present
laid
claim
(
deafening
cheers
and
waving
of
handkerchiefs
)
?
 
<EOS>
The
captain
concluded
,
amidst
loud
applause
,
by
calling
upon
the
parishioners
to
sound
the
tocsin
,
rush
to
the
poll
,
free
themselves
from
dictation
,
or
be
slaves
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
the
polling
began
,
and
we
never
have
had
such
a
bustle
in
our
parish
since
we
got
up
our
famous
anti
-
slavery
petition
,
which
was
such
an
important
one
,
that
the
House
of
Commons
ordered
it
to
be
printed
,
on
the
motion
of
the
member
for
the
district
.
 
<EOS>
The
captain
engaged
two
hackney
-
coaches
and
a
cab
for
Bung
's
people
---
the
cab
for
the
drunken
voters
,
and
the
two
coaches
for
the
old
ladies
,
the
greater
portion
of
whom
,
owing
to
the
captain
's
impetuosity
,
were
driven
up
to
the
poll
and
home
again
,
before
they
recovered
from
their
flurry
sufficiently
to
know
,
with
any
degree
of
clearness
,
what
they
had
been
doing
.
 
<EOS>
The
opposite
party
wholly
neglected
these
precautions
,
and
the
consequence
was
,
that
a
great
many
ladies
who
were
walking
leisurely
up
to
the
church
---
for
it
was
a
very
hot
day
---
to
vote
for
Spruggins
,
were
artfully
decoyed
into
the
coaches
,
and
voted
for
Bung
.
 
<EOS>
The
captain
's
arguments
,
too
,
had
produced
considerable
effect
:
 
the
attempted
influence
of
the
vestry
produced
a
greater
.
<EOS>
A
threat
of
exclusive
dealing
was
clearly
established
against
the
vestry
-
clerk
---
a
case
of
heartless
and
profligate
atrocity
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
the
delinquent
had
been
in
the
habit
of
purchasing
six
penn'orth
of
muffins
,
weekly
,
from
an
old
woman
who
rents
a
small
house
in
the
parish
,
and
resides
among
the
original
settlers
;
on
her
last
weekly
visit
,
a
message
was
conveyed
to
her
through
the
medium
of
the
cook
,
couched
in
mysterious
terms
,
but
indicating
with
sufficient
clearness
,
that
the
vestry
-
clerk
's
appetite
for
muffins
,
in
future
,
depended
entirely
on
her
vote
on
the
beadleship
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
sufficient
:
 
<EOS>
the
stream
had
been
turning
previously
,
and
the
impulse
thus
administered
directed
its
final
course
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bung
party
ordered
one
shilling's
-
worth
of
muffins
weekly
for
the
remainder
of
the
old
woman
's
natural
life
;
the
parishioners
were
loud
in
their
exclamations
;
and
the
fate
of
Spruggins
was
sealed
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
the
twins
were
exhibited
in
dresses
of
the
same
pattern
,
and
night
-
caps
,
to
match
,
at
the
church
door
:
 
<EOS>
the
boy
in
Mrs
Spruggins
's
right
arm
,
and
the
girl
in
her
left
---
<EOS>
even
Mrs
Spruggins
herself
failed
to
be
an
object
of
sympathy
any
longer
.
<EOS>
The
majority
attained
by
Bung
on
the
gross
poll
was
four
hundred
and
twenty
-
eight
,
and
the
cause
of
the
parishioners
triumphed
.
   
<EOS>
The

<EOS>
The
excitement
of
the
late
election
has
subsided
,
and
our
parish
being
once
again
restored
to
a
state
of
comparative
tranquillity
,
we
are
enabled
to
devote
our
attention
to
those
parishioners
who
take
little
share
in
our
party
contests
or
in
the
turmoil
and
bustle
of
public
life
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
feel
sincere
pleasure
in
acknowledging
here
,
that
in
collecting
materials
for
this
task
we
have
been
greatly
assisted
by
Mr
Bung
himself
,
who
has
imposed
on
us
a
debt
of
obligation
which
we
fear
we
can
never
repay
.
 
<EOS>
The
life
of
this
gentleman
has
been
one
of
a
very
chequered
description
:
 
he
has
undergone
transitions
---
not
from
grave
to
gay
,
for
he
never
was
grave
---
not
from
lively
to
severe
,
for
severity
forms
no
part
of
his
disposition
;
his
fluctuations
have
been
between
poverty
in
the
extreme
,
and
poverty
modified
,
or
,
to
use
his
own
emphatic
language
,
"
between
nothing
to
eat
and
just
half
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
,
as
he
forcibly
remarks
,
"
one
of
those
fortunate
men
who
,
if
they
were
to
dive
under
one
side
of
a
barge
stark
-
naked
,
would
come
up
on
the
other
with
a
new
suit
of
clothes
on
,
and
a
ticket
for
soup
in
the
waistcoat
-
pocket
:
"
neither
is
he
one
of
those
,
whose
spirit
has
been
broken
beyond
redemption
by
misfortune
and
want
.
<EOS>
He
is
just
one
of
the
careless
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
,
happy
fellows
,
who
float
,
cork
-
like
,
on
the
surface
,
for
the
world
to
play
at
hockey
with
:
 
<EOS>
knocked
here
,
and
there
,
and
everywhere
:
 
now
to
the
right
,
then
to
the
left
,
again
up
in
the
air
,
and
anon
to
the
bottom
,
but
always
reappearing
and
bounding
with
the
stream
buoyantly
and
merrily
along
.
 
<EOS>
Some
few
months
before
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
stand
a
contested
election
for
the
office
of
beadle
,
necessity
attached
him
to
the
service
of
a
broker
;
and
on
the
opportunities
he
here
acquired
of
ascertaining
the
condition
of
most
of
the
poorer
inhabitants
of
the
parish
,
his
patron
,
the
captain
,
first
grounded
his
claims
to
public
support
.
 
<EOS>
Chance
threw
the
man
in
our
way
a
short
time
since
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
,
in
the
first
instance
,
attracted
by
his
prepossessing
impudence
at
the
election
;
we
were
not
surprised
,
on
further
acquaintance
,
to
find
him
a
shrewd
,
knowing
fellow
,
with
no
inconsiderable
power
of
observation
;
and
,
after
conversing
with
him
a
little
,
were
somewhat
struck
<EOS>
(
as
we
dare
say
our
readers
have
frequently
been
in
other
cases
)
with
the
power
some
men
seem
to
have
,
not
only
of
sympathising
with
,
but
to
all
appearance
of
understanding
feelings
to
which
they
themselves
are
entire
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
been
expressing
to
the
new
functionary
our
surprise
that
he
should
ever
have
served
in
the
capacity
to
which
we
have
just
adverted
,
when
we
gradually
led
him
into
one
or
two
professional
anecdotes
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
are
induced
to
think
,
on
reflection
,
that
they
will
tell
better
in
nearly
his
own
words
,
than
with
any
attempted
embellishments
of
ours
,
we
will
at
once
entitle
them
.

MR
BUNG
'S
NARRATIVE
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
true
,
as
you
say
,
sir
,
"
Mr
Bung
commenced
,
"
that
a
broker
's
man
's
is
not
a
life
to
be
envied
;
and
in
course
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
though
you
do
n't
say
it
,
that
people
hate
and
scout
'em
because
they
're
the
ministers
of
wretchedness
,
like
,
to
poor
people
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
could
I
do
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
The
thing
was
no
worse
because
I
did
it
,
instead
of
somebody
else
;
and
if
putting
me
in
possession
of
a
house
would
put
me
in
possession
of
three
and
sixpence
a
day
,
and
levying
a
distress
on
another
man
's
goods
would
relieve
my
distress
and
that
of
my
family
,
it
ca
n't
be
expected
but
what
I
'd
take
the
job
and
go
through
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
liked
it
<EOS>
,
God
knows
;
I
always
looked
out
for
something
else
,
and
<EOS>
the
moment
I
got
other
work
to
do
,
I
left
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
is
anything
wrong
in
being
the
agent
in
such
matters
---
not
the
principal
,
mind
you
---
I
'm
sure
the
business
,
to
a
beginner
like
I
was
,
at
all
events
,
carries
its
own
punishment
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
wished
again
and
again
that
the
people
would
only
blow
me
up
,
or
pitch
into
me
---
that
I
would
n't
have
minded
<EOS>
,
it
's
all
in
my
way
;
but
it
's
the
being
shut
up
by
yourself
in
one
room
for
five
days
,
without
so
much
as
an
old
newspaper
to
look
at
,
or
anything
to
see
out
o
'
the
winder
but
the
roofs
and
chimneys
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
or
anything
to
listen
to
,
but
the
ticking
,
perhaps
,
of
an
old
Dutch
clock
,
the
sobbing
of
the
missis
,
now
and
then
,
the
low
talking
of
friends
in
the
next
room
,
who
speak
in
whispers
,
lest
"
the
man
"
should
overhear
them
,
or
perhaps
the
occasional
opening
of
the
door
,
as
a
child
peeps
in
to
look
at
you
,
and
then
runs
half
-
frightened
away
<EOS>
---
it
's
all
this
,
that
makes
you
feel
sneaking
somehow
,
and
ashamed
of
yourself
;
and
then
,
if
it
's
wintertime
,
they
just
give
you
fire
enough
to
make
you
think
you
'd
like
more
,
and
bring
in
your
grub
as
if
they
wished
it
'
ud
choke
you
---
as
I
dare
say
they
do
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
most
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
're
very
civil
,
they
make
you
up
a
bed
in
the
room
at
night
,
and
if
they
do
n't
,
your
master
sends
one
in
for
you
;
but
there
you
are
,
without
being
washed
or
shaved
all
the
time
,
shunned
by
everybody
,
and
spoken
to
by
no
one
,
unless
some
one
comes
in
at
dinner
-
time
,
and
asks
you
whether
you
want
any
more
,
in
a
tone
as
much
to
say
,
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
,
"
or
,
in
the
evening
,
to
inquire
whether
you
would
n't
rather
have
a
candle
,
after
you
've
been
sitting
in
the
dark
half
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
left
in
this
way
,
I
used
to
sit
,
think
,
think
,
thinking
,
till
I
felt
as
lonesome
as
a
kitten
in
a
wash
-
house
copper
with
the
lid
on
;
but
I
believe
the
old
brokers
'
men
who
are
regularly
trained
to
it
,
never
think
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
some
on
'em
<EOS>
say
,
indeed
,
that
they
do
n't
know
how
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
put
in
a
good
many
distresses
in
my
time
(
continued
Mr
Bung
)
,
and
in
course
I
was
n't
long
in
finding
,
that
some
people
are
not
as
much
to
be
pitied
as
others
are
,
and
that
people
with
good
incomes
who
get
into
difficulties
,
which
they
keep
patching
up
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
,
get
so
used
to
these
sort
of
things
in
time
,
that
at
last
they
come
scarcely
to
feel
them
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
very
first
place
I
was
put
in
possession
of
,
was
a
gentleman
's
house
in
this
parish
here
,
that
everybody
would
suppose
could
n't
help
having
money
if
he
tried
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
with
old
Fixem
,
my
old
master
,
'bout
half
arter
eight
in
the
morning
;
rang
the
area
-
bell
;
servant
in
livery
opened
the
door
:
 
<EOS>
"
Governor
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
Yes
,
he
is
,
"
says
the
man
;
"
but
he
's
breakfasting
just
now
.
"
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
says
Fixem
,
"
<EOS>
just
you
tell
him
there
's
a
gentleman
here
,
as
wants
to
speak
to
him
partickler
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
the
servant
he
opens
his
eyes
,
and
stares
about
him
all
ways
---
looking
for
the
gentleman
,
as
it
struck
me
,
for
I
do
n't
think
anybody
but
a
man
as
was
stone
-
blind
would
mistake
Fixem
for
one
;
and
as
for
me
,
I
was
as
seedy
as
a
cheap
cowcumber
.
 
<EOS>
Hows'ever
,
he
turns
round
,
and
goes
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
which
was
a
little
snug
sort
of
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
and
Fixem
(
as
we
always
did
in
that
profession
)
,
without
waiting
to
be
announced
,
walks
in
arter
him
,
and
before
the
servant
could
get
out
,
"
Please
,
sir
,
here
's
a
man
as
wants
to
speak
to
you
,
"
looks
in
at
the
door
as
familiar
and
pleasant
as
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
the
devil
are
you
,
and
how
dare
you
walk
into
a
gentleman
's
house
without
leave
?
"
says
the
master
,
as
fierce
as
a
bull
in
fits
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
name
,
"
says
Fixem
,
winking
to
the
master
to
send
the
servant
away
,
and
putting
the
warrant
into
his
hands
folded
up
like
a
note
,
"
My
name
's
Smith
,
"
says
he
,
"
and
I
called
from
Johnson
's
about
that
business
of
Thompson
's
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
Oh
,
"
says
the
other
,
quite
down
on
him
directly
,
"
<EOS>
How
IS
Thompson
?
"
says
he
;
"
Pray
sit
down
,
Mr
Smith
:
 
John
,
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Out
went
the
servant
;
and
the
gentleman
and
Fixem
looked
at
one
another
till
they
could
n't
look
any
longer
,
and
then
they
varied
the
amusements
by
looking
at
me
,
who
had
been
standing
on
the
mat
all
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hundred
and
fifty
pounds
,
I
see
,
"
said
the
gentleman
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
Hundred
and
fifty
pound
,
"
said
Fixem
,
"
besides
cost
of
levy
,
sheriff
's
poundage
,
and
all
other
incidental
expenses
.
<EOS>
"
---
"
Um
,
"
says
the
gentleman
,
"
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
settle
this
before
to
-
morrow
afternoon
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
Very
sorry
;
but
I
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
my
man
here
till
then
,
"
replies
Fixem
,
pretending
to
look
very
miserable
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
unfort'nate
,
"
says
the
gentleman
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
have
got
a
large
party
here
to
-
night
,
and
I
'm
ruined
if
those
fellows
of
mine
get
an
inkling
of
the
matter
---
<EOS>
just
step
here
,
Mr
Smith
,
"
says
he
,
after
a
short
pause
.
 
<EOS>
So
Fixem
walks
with
him
up
to
the
window
,
and
after
a
good
deal
of
whispering
,
and
a
little
chinking
of
suverins
,
and
looking
at
me
,
he
comes
back
and
says
,
"
Bung
,
you
're
a
handy
fellow
,
and
very
honest
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
wants
an
assistant
to
clean
the
plate
and
wait
at
table
to
-
day
,
and
if
you
're
not
particularly
engaged
,
"
says
old
Fixem
,
grinning
like
mad
,
and
shoving
a
couple
of
suverins
into
my
hand
,
"
he
'll
be
very
glad
to
avail
himself
of
your
services
.
"
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
laughed
:
 
and
the
gentleman
laughed
,
and
we
all
laughed
;
and
I
went
home
and
cleaned
myself
,
leaving
Fixem
there
,
and
when
I
went
back
,
Fixem
went
away
,
and
I
polished
up
the
plate
,
and
waited
at
table
,
and
gammoned
the
servants
,
and
nobody
had
the
least
idea
I
was
in
possession
,
though
it
very
nearly
came
out
after
all
;
for
one
of
the
last
gentlemen
who
remained
,
came
down
-
stairs
into
the
hall
where
I
was
sitting
pretty
late
at
night
,
and
putting
half
-
a
-
crown
into
my
hand
,
says
,
"
Here
,
my
man
,
"
says
he
,
"
run
and
get
me
a
coach
,
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
a
do
,
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
,
and
was
just
going
to
say
so
,
sulkily
enough
,
when
the
gentleman
(
who
was
up
to
everything
)
came
running
down
-
stairs
,
as
if
he
was
in
great
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bung
,
"
says
he
,
pretending
to
be
in
a
consuming
passion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
says
I.
 
"
<EOS>
Why
the
devil
<EOS>
an't
you
looking
after
that
plate
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
I
was
just
going
to
send
him
for
a
coach
for
me
,
"
says
the
other
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
was
just
a
-
going
to
say
,
"
says
I
---
<EOS>
"
Anybody
else
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
interrupts
the
master
of
the
house
,
pushing
me
down
the
passage
to
get
out
of
the
way
---
"
anybody
else
;
but
I
have
put
this
man
in
possession
of
all
the
plate
and
valuables
,
and
I
can
not
allow
him
on
any
consideration
whatever
,
to
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Bung
,
you
scoundrel
,
go
and
count
those
forks
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
went
laughing
pretty
hearty
when
I
found
it
was
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
The
money
was
paid
next
day
,
with
the
addition
of
something
else
for
myself
,
and
that
was
the
best
job
that
I
(
and
I
suspect
old
Fixem
too
)
<EOS>
ever
got
in
that
line
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
,
sir
,
after
all
,
"
resumed
Mr
Bung
,
laying
aside
the
knowing
look
and
flash
air
,
with
which
he
had
repeated
the
previous
anecdote
---
"
and
I
'm
sorry
to
say
<EOS>
,
it
's
the
side
one
sees
very
,
very
seldom
,
in
comparison
with
the
dark
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
civility
which
money
will
purchase
,
is
rarely
extended
to
those
who
have
none
;
and
there
's
a
consolation
even
in
being
able
to
patch
up
one
difficulty
,
to
make
way
for
another
,
to
which
very
poor
people
are
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
once
put
into
a
house
down
George's
-
yard
---
that
little
dirty
court
at
the
back
of
the
gas
-
works
;
and
I
never
shall
forget
the
misery
of
them
people
,
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
distress
for
half
a
year
's
rent
---
two
pound
ten
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
two
rooms
in
the
house
,
and
as
there
was
no
passage
,
the
lodgers
up
-
stairs
always
went
through
the
room
of
the
people
of
the
house
,
as
they
passed
in
and
out
;
and
every
time
they
did
so
<EOS>
-which
,
on
the
average
,
was
about
four
times
every
quarter
of
an
hour
---
they
blowed
up
quite
frightful
:
 
for
their
things
had
been
seized
too
,
and
included
in
the
inventory
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
piece
of
enclosed
dust
in
front
of
the
house
,
with
a
cinder
-
path
leading
up
to
the
door
,
and
an
open
rain
-
water
butt
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
A
dirty
striped
curtain
,
on
a
very
slack
string
,
hung
in
the
window
,
and
a
little
triangular
bit
of
broken
looking
-
glass
rested
on
the
sill
inside
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
was
meant
for
the
people
's
use
,
but
their
appearance
was
so
wretched
,
and
so
miserable
,
that
I
'm
certain
they
never
could
have
plucked
up
courage
to
look
themselves
in
the
face
a
second
time
,
if
they
survived
the
fright
of
doing
so
once
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
two
or
three
chairs
,
that
might
have
been
worth
,
in
their
best
days
,
from
eightpence
to
a
shilling
a
-
piece
;
a
small
deal
table
,
an
old
corner
cupboard
with
nothing
in
it
,
and
one
of
those
bedsteads
which
turn
up
half
way
,
and
leave
the
bottom
legs
sticking
out
for
you
to
knock
your
head
against
,
or
hang
your
hat
upon
;
no
bed
,
no
bedding
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
sack
,
by
way
of
rug
,
before
the
fireplace
,
and
four
or
five
children
were
grovelling
about
,
among
the
sand
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
execution
was
only
put
in
,
to
get
'em
out
of
the
house
,
for
there
was
nothing
to
take
to
pay
the
expenses
;
and
here
I
stopped
for
three
days
,
though
that
was
a
mere
form
too
:
 
for
,
in
course
,
I
knew
,
and
we
all
knew
,
they
could
never
pay
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
chairs
,
by
the
side
of
the
place
where
the
fire
ought
to
have
been
,
was
an
old
'
ooman
---
the
ugliest
and
dirtiest
I
ever
see
---
who
sat
rocking
herself
backwards
and
forwards
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
without
once
stopping
,
except
for
an
instant
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
clasp
together
the
withered
hands
which
,
with
these
exceptions
,
she
kept
constantly
rubbing
upon
her
knees
,
just
raising
and
depressing
her
fingers
convulsively
,
in
time
to
the
rocking
of
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
sat
the
mother
with
an
infant
in
her
arms
,
which
cried
till
it
cried
itself
to
sleep
,
and
when
it
"
woke
,
cried
till
it
cried
itself
off
again
.
<EOS>
The
old
'
ooman
's
voice
<EOS>
I
never
heard
:
 
<EOS>
she
seemed
completely
stupefied
;
and
as
to
the
mother
's
,
it
would
have
been
better
if
she
had
been
so
too
,
for
misery
had
changed
her
to
a
devil
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
heard
how
she
cursed
the
little
naked
children
as
was
rolling
on
the
floor
,
and
seen
how
savagely
she
struck
the
infant
when
it
cried
with
hunger
,
you
'd
have
shuddered
as
much
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
There
they
remained
all
the
time
:
 
<EOS>
the
children
ate
a
morsel
of
bread
once
or
twice
,
and
I
gave
'em
best
part
of
the
dinners
my
missis
brought
me
,
but
the
woman
ate
nothing
;
they
never
even
laid
on
the
bedstead
,
nor
was
the
room
swept
or
cleaned
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
neighbours
were
all
too
poor
themselves
to
take
any
notice
of
'em
,
but
from
what
I
could
make
out
from
the
abuse
of
the
woman
up
-
stairs
,
it
seemed
the
husband
had
been
transported
a
few
weeks
before
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
time
was
up
,
the
landlord
and
old
Fixem
too
,
got
rather
frightened
about
the
family
,
and
so
they
made
a
stir
about
it
,
and
had
'em
taken
to
the
workhouse
.
 
<EOS>
They
sent
the
sick
couch
for
the
old
'
ooman
,
and
Simmons
took
the
children
away
at
night
.
<EOS>
The
old
'
ooman
went
into
the
infirmary
,
and
very
soon
died
.
 
<EOS>
The
children
are
all
in
the
house
to
this
day
,
and
very
comfortable
they
are
in
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
mother
,
there
was
no
taming
her
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
a
quiet
,
hard
-
working
woman
,
I
believe
,
but
her
misery
had
actually
drove
her
wild
;
so
after
she
had
been
sent
to
the
house
of
correction
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
,
for
throwing
inkstands
at
the
overseers
,
blaspheming
the
churchwardens
,
and
smashing
everybody
as
come
near
her
,
she
burst
a
blood
-
vessel
one
mornin
'
,
and
died
too
;
and
a
happy
release
it
was
,
both
for
herself
and
the
old
paupers
,
male
and
female
,
which
she
used
to
tip
over
in
all
directions
,
as
if
they
were
so
many
skittles
,
and
she
the
ball
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
this
was
bad
enough
,
"
resumed
Mr
Bung
,
taking
a
half
-
step
towards
the
door
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
he
had
nearly
concluded
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
bad
enough
,
but
there
was
a
sort
of
quiet
misery
---
if
you
understand
what
I
mean
by
that
,
sir
---
about
a
lady
at
one
house
I
was
put
into
,
as
touched
me
a
good
deal
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
does
n't
matter
where
it
was
exactly
:
 
indeed
,
I
'd
rather
not
say
,
but
it
was
the
same
sort
o
'
job
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
with
Fixem
in
the
usual
way
---
there
was
a
year
's
rent
in
arrear
;
a
very
small
servant
-
girl
opened
the
door
,
and
three
or
four
fine
-
looking
little
children
was
in
the
front
parlour
we
were
shown
into
,
which
was
very
clean
,
but
very
scantily
furnished
,
much
like
the
children
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bung
,
"
says
Fixem
to
me
,
in
a
low
voice
,
when
we
were
left
alone
for
a
minute
,
"
I
know
something
about
this
here
family
,
and
my
opinion
is
,
it
's
no
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
they
ca
n't
settle
?
"
says
I
,
quite
anxiously
;
for
I
liked
the
looks
of
them
children
.
 
<EOS>
Fixem
shook
his
head
,
and
was
just
about
to
reply
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
in
come
a
lady
,
as
white
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
any
one
in
my
days
,
except
about
the
eyes
,
which
were
red
with
crying
.
 
<EOS>
She
walked
in
,
as
firm
as
I
could
have
done
;
shut
the
door
carefully
after
her
,
and
sat
herself
down
with
a
face
as
composed
as
if
it
was
made
of
stone
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
"
says
she
,
in
a
surprisin
'
steady
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
IS
this
an
execution
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
mum
,
"
says
Fixem
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
looked
at
him
as
steady
as
ever
:
 
<EOS>
she
did
n't
seem
to
have
understood
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
mum
,
"
says
Fixem
again
;
"
this
is
my
warrant
of
distress
,
mum
,
"
says
he
,
handing
it
over
as
polite
as
if
it
was
a
newspaper
which
had
been
bespoke
arter
the
next
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
lady
's
lip
trembled
as
she
took
the
printed
paper
.
 
<EOS>
She
cast
her
eye
over
it
,
and
old
Fixem
began
to
explain
the
form
,
but
saw
she
was
n't
reading
it
,
plain
enough
,
poor
thing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
God
!
"
says
she
,
suddenly
a
-
bursting
out
crying
,
letting
the
warrant
fall
,
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
noise
she
made
,
brought
in
a
young
lady
of
about
nineteen
or
twenty
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
had
been
a
-
listening
at
the
door
,
and
who
had
got
a
little
boy
in
her
arms
:
 
<EOS>
she
sat
him
down
in
the
lady
's
lap
,
without
speaking
,
and
she
hugged
the
poor
little
fellow
to
her
bosom
,
and
cried
over
him
,
till
even
old
Fixem
put
on
his
blue
spectacles
to
hide
the
two
tears
,
that
was
a
-
trickling
down
,
one
on
each
side
of
his
dirty
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
dear
ma
,
"
says
the
young
lady
,
"
you
know
how
much
you
have
borne
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
our
sakes
---
for
pa
's
sake
,
"
says
she
,
"
do
n't
give
way
to
this
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
No
,
no
,
I
wo
n't
!
"
says
the
lady
,
gathering
herself
up
,
hastily
,
and
drying
her
eyes
;
"
I
am
very
foolish
,
but
I
'm
better
now
---
much
better
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
roused
herself
up
,
went
with
us
into
every
room
while
we
took
the
inventory
,
opened
all
the
drawers
of
her
own
accord
,
sorted
the
children
's
little
clothes
to
make
the
work
easier
;
and
,
except
doing
everything
in
a
strange
sort
of
hurry
,
seemed
as
calm
and
composed
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
came
down
-
stairs
again
,
she
hesitated
a
minute
or
two
,
and
at
last
says
,
"
Gentlemen
,
"
says
she
,
"
I
am
afraid
I
have
done
wrong
,
and
perhaps
it
may
bring
you
into
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
secreted
just
now
,
"
she
says
,
"
the
only
trinket
I
have
left
in
the
world
---
here
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
she
lays
down
on
the
table
a
little
miniature
mounted
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
miniature
,
"
she
says
,
"
of
my
poor
dear
father
!
 
<EOS>
I
little
thought
once
,
that
I
should
ever
thank
God
for
depriving
me
of
the
original
,
but
I
do
,
and
have
done
for
years
back
,
most
fervently
.
<EOS>
Take
it
away
,
sir
,
"
she
says
,
"
it
's
a
face
that
never
turned
from
me
in
sickness
and
distress
,
and
I
can
hardly
bear
to
turn
from
it
now
,
when
,
God
knows
,
I
suffer
both
in
no
ordinary
degree
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
say
nothing
,
but
I
raised
my
head
from
the
inventory
which
I
was
filling
up
,
and
looked
at
Fixem
;
the
old
fellow
nodded
to
me
significantly
,
so
I
ran
my
pen
through
the
"
MINI
"
I
had
just
written
,
and
left
the
miniature
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
to
make
short
of
a
long
story
,
I
was
left
in
possession
,
and
in
possession
I
remained
;
and
though
I
was
an
ignorant
man
,
and
the
master
of
the
house
a
clever
one
<EOS>
,
I
saw
what
he
never
did
,
but
what
he
would
give
worlds
now
(
if
he
had
'em
)
to
have
seen
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
,
sir
,
that
his
wife
was
wasting
away
,
beneath
cares
of
which
she
never
complained
,
and
griefs
she
never
told
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
that
she
was
dying
before
his
eyes
;
I
knew
that
one
exertion
from
him
might
have
saved
her
,
but
he
never
made
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
blame
him
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
COULD
rouse
himself
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
so
long
anticipated
all
his
wishes
,
and
acted
for
him
,
that
he
was
a
lost
man
when
left
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
when
I
caught
sight
of
her
,
in
the
clothes
she
used
to
wear
,
which
looked
shabby
even
upon
her
,
and
would
have
been
scarcely
decent
on
any
one
else
,
that
if
I
was
a
gentleman
it
would
wring
my
very
heart
to
see
the
woman
that
was
a
smart
and
merry
girl
when
I
courted
her
,
so
altered
through
her
love
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Bitter
cold
and
damp
weather
it
was
,
yet
,
though
her
dress
was
thin
,
and
her
shoes
none
of
the
best
,
during
the
whole
three
days
,
from
morning
to
night
,
she
was
out
of
doors
running
about
to
try
and
raise
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
money
WAS
raised
and
the
execution
was
paid
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
family
crowded
into
the
room
where
I
was
,
when
the
money
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
was
quite
happy
as
the
inconvenience
was
removed
<EOS>
---
I
dare
say
he
did
n't
know
how
;
the
children
looked
merry
and
cheerful
again
;
the
eldest
girl
was
bustling
about
,
making
preparations
for
the
first
comfortable
meal
they
had
had
since
the
distress
was
put
in
;
and
the
mother
looked
pleased
to
see
them
all
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
ever
I
saw
death
in
a
woman
's
face
,
I
saw
it
in
hers
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
right
,
sir
,
"
continued
Mr
Bung
,
hurriedly
passing
his
coat
-
sleeve
over
his
face
;
"
the
family
grew
more
prosperous
,
and
good
fortune
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
Those
children
are
motherless
now
,
and
their
father
would
give
up
all
he
has
since
gained
---
house
,
home
,
goods
,
money
:
 
all
that
he
has
,
or
ever
can
have
,
to
restore
the
wife
he
has
lost
.

The
ladies
'
societies
Our
Parish
is
very
prolific
in
ladies
'
charitable
institutions
.
 
<EOS>
In
winter
,
when
wet
feet
are
common
,
and
colds
not
scarce
,
we
have
the
ladies
'
soup
distribution
society
,
the
ladies
'
coal
distribution
society
,
and
the
ladies
'
blanket
distribution
society
;
in
summer
,
when
stone
fruits
flourish
and
stomach
aches
prevail
,
we
have
the
ladies
'
dispensary
,
and
the
ladies
'
sick
visitation
committee
;
and
all
the
year
round
<EOS>
we
have
the
ladies
'
child
's
examination
society
,
the
ladies
'
bible
and
prayer
-
book
circulation
society
,
and
the
ladies
'
childbed
-
linen
monthly
loan
society
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
latter
are
decidedly
the
most
important
;
whether
they
are
productive
of
more
benefit
than
the
rest
,
it
is
not
for
us
to
say
,
but
we
can
take
upon
ourselves
to
affirm
,
with
the
utmost
solemnity
,
that
they
create
a
greater
stir
and
more
bustle
,
than
all
the
others
put
together
.
   
<EOS>
We
should
be
disposed
to
affirm
,
on
the
first
blush
of
the
matter
,
that
the
bible
and
prayer
-
book
society
is
not
so
popular
as
the
childbed
-
linen
society
;
the
bible
and
prayer
-
book
society
has
,
however
,
considerably
increased
in
importance
within
the
last
year
or
two
,
having
derived
some
adventitious
aid
from
the
factious
opposition
of
the
child
's
examination
society
;
which
factious
opposition
originated
in
manner
following
:
---
When
the
young
curate
was
popular
,
and
all
the
unmarried
ladies
in
the
parish
took
a
serious
turn
,
the
charity
children
all
at
once
became
objects
of
peculiar
and
especial
interest
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
Miss
Browns
(
enthusiastic
admirers
of
the
curate
)
taught
,
and
exercised
,
and
examined
,
and
re
-
examined
the
unfortunate
children
,
until
the
boys
grew
pale
,
and
the
girls
consumptive
with
study
and
fatigue
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
Miss
Browns
stood
it
out
very
well
,
because
they
relieved
each
other
;
but
the
children
,
having
no
relief
at
all
,
exhibited
decided
symptoms
of
weariness
and
care
.
 
<EOS>
The
unthinking
part
of
the
parishioners
laughed
at
all
this
,
but
the
more
reflective
portion
of
the
inhabitants
abstained
from
expressing
any
opinion
on
the
subject
until
that
of
the
curate
had
been
clearly
ascertained
.
   
<EOS>
The
opportunity
was
not
long
wanting
.
 
<EOS>
The
curate
preached
a
charity
sermon
on
behalf
of
the
charity
school
,
and
in
the
charity
sermon
aforesaid
,
expatiated
in
glowing
terms
on
the
praiseworthy
and
indefatigable
exertions
of
certain
estimable
individuals
.
 
<EOS>
Sobs
were
heard
to
issue
from
the
three
Miss
Browns
'
pew
;
the
pew
-
opener
of
the
division
was
seen
to
hurry
down
the
centre
aisle
to
the
vestry
door
,
and
to
return
immediately
,
bearing
a
glass
of
water
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
A
low
moaning
ensued
;
two
more
pew
-
openers
rushed
to
the
spot
,
and
the
three
Miss
Browns
,
each
supported
by
a
pew
-
opener
,
were
led
out
of
the
church
,
and
led
in
again
after
the
lapse
of
five
minutes
with
white
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
to
their
eyes
,
as
if
they
had
been
attending
a
funeral
in
the
churchyard
adjoining
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
doubt
had
for
a
moment
existed
,
as
to
whom
the
allusion
was
intended
to
apply
,
it
was
at
once
removed
.
 
<EOS>
The
wish
to
enlighten
the
charity
children
became
universal
,
and
the
three
Miss
Browns
were
unanimously
besought
to
divide
the
school
into
classes
,
and
to
assign
each
class
to
the
superintendence
of
two
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
A
little
learning
is
a
dangerous
thing
,
but
a
little
patronage
is
more
so
;
the
three
Miss
Browns
appointed
all
the
old
maids
,
and
carefully
excluded
the
young
ones
.
 
<EOS>
Maiden
aunts
triumphed
,
mammas
were
reduced
to
the
lowest
depths
of
despair
,
and
there
is
no
telling
in
what
act
of
violence
the
general
indignation
against
the
three
Miss
Browns
might
have
vented
itself
,
had
not
a
perfectly
providential
occurrence
changed
the
tide
of
public
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Johnson
Parker
,
the
mother
of
seven
extremely
fine
girls
---
all
unmarried
---
hastily
reported
to
several
other
mammas
of
several
other
unmarried
families
,
that
five
old
men
,
six
old
women
,
and
children
innumerable
,
in
the
free
seats
near
her
pew
,
were
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
church
every
Sunday
,
without
either
bible
or
prayer
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
Was
this
to
be
borne
in
a
civilised
country
?
 
<EOS>
Could
such
things
be
tolerated
in
a
Christian
land
?
 
<EOS>
Never
!
 
<EOS>
A
ladies
'
bible
and
prayer
-
book
distribution
society
was
instantly
formed
:
president
,
Mrs
Johnson
Parker
;
treasurers
,
auditors
,
and
secretary
,
the
Misses
Johnson
Parker
:
 
subscriptions
were
entered
into
,
books
were
bought
,
all
the
free
-
seat
people
provided
therewith
,
and
when
the
first
lesson
was
given
out
,
on
the
first
Sunday
succeeding
these
events
,
there
was
such
a
dropping
of
books
,
and
rustling
of
leaves
,
that
it
was
morally
impossible
to
hear
one
word
of
the
service
for
five
minutes
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
The
three
Miss
Browns
,
and
their
party
,
saw
the
approaching
danger
,
and
endeavoured
to
avert
it
by
ridicule
and
sarcasm
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
the
old
men
nor
the
old
women
could
read
their
books
,
now
they
had
got
them
,
said
the
three
Miss
Browns
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
;
they
could
learn
,
replied
Mrs
Johnson
Parker
.
 
<EOS>
The
children
could
n't
read
either
,
suggested
the
three
Miss
Browns
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
;
they
could
be
taught
,
retorted
Mrs
Johnson
Parker
.
 
<EOS>
A
balance
of
parties
took
place
.
<EOS>
The
Miss
Browns
publicly
examined
---
popular
feeling
inclined
to
the
child
's
examination
society
.
 
<EOS>
The
Miss
Johnson
Parkers
publicly
distributed
---
a
reaction
took
place
in
favour
of
the
prayer
-
book
distribution
.
 
<EOS>
A
feather
would
have
turned
the
scale
,
and
a
feather
did
turn
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
missionary
returned
from
the
West
Indies
;
he
was
to
be
presented
to
the
Dissenters
'
Missionary
Society
on
his
marriage
with
a
wealthy
widow
.
 
<EOS>
Overtures
were
made
to
the
Dissenters
by
the
Johnson
Parkers
.
 
<EOS>
Their
object
was
the
same
,
and
why
not
have
a
joint
meeting
of
the
two
societies
?
 
<EOS>
The
proposition
was
accepted
.
<EOS>
The
meeting
was
duly
heralded
by
public
announcement
,
and
the
room
was
crowded
to
suffocation
.
 
<EOS>
The
Missionary
appeared
on
the
platform
;
he
was
hailed
with
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
He
repeated
a
dialogue
he
had
heard
between
two
negroes
,
behind
a
hedge
,
on
the
subject
of
distribution
societies
;
the
approbation
was
tumultuous
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
an
imitation
of
the
two
negroes
in
broken
English
;
the
roof
was
rent
with
applause
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
period
we
date
(
with
one
trifling
exception
)
a
daily
increase
in
the
popularity
of
the
distribution
society
,
and
an
increase
of
popularity
,
which
the
feeble
and
impotent
opposition
of
the
examination
party
,
has
only
tended
to
augment
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
great
points
about
the
childbed
-
linen
monthly
loan
society
are
,
that
it
is
less
dependent
on
the
fluctuations
of
public
opinion
than
either
the
distribution
or
the
child
's
examination
;
and
that
,
come
what
may
,
there
is
never
any
lack
of
objects
on
which
to
exercise
its
benevolence
.
 
<EOS>
Our
parish
is
a
very
populous
one
,
and
,
if
anything
,
contributes
,
we
should
be
disposed
to
say
,
rather
more
than
its
due
share
to
the
aggregate
amount
of
births
in
the
metropolis
and
its
environs
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
is
,
that
the
monthly
loan
society
flourishes
,
and
invests
its
members
with
a
most
enviable
amount
of
bustling
patronage
.
 
<EOS>
The
society
(
whose
only
notion
of
dividing
time
,
would
appear
to
be
its
allotment
into
months
)
holds
monthly
tea
-
drinkings
,
at
which
the
monthly
report
is
received
,
a
secretary
elected
for
the
month
ensuing
,
and
such
of
the
monthly
boxes
as
may
not
happen
to
be
out
on
loan
for
the
month
,
carefully
examined
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
never
present
at
one
of
these
meetings
,
from
all
of
which
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
,
gentlemen
are
carefully
excluded
;
but
Mr
Bung
has
been
called
before
the
board
once
or
twice
,
and
we
have
his
authority
for
stating
,
that
its
proceedings
are
conducted
with
great
order
and
regularity
:
 
not
more
than
four
members
being
allowed
to
speak
at
one
time
on
any
pretence
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
The
regular
committee
is
composed
exclusively
of
married
ladies
,
but
a
vast
number
of
young
unmarried
ladies
of
from
eighteen
to
twenty
-
five
years
of
age
,
respectively
,
are
admitted
as
honorary
members
,
partly
because
they
are
very
useful
in
replenishing
the
boxes
,
and
visiting
the
confined
;
partly
because
it
is
highly
desirable
that
they
should
be
initiated
,
at
an
early
period
,
into
the
more
serious
and
matronly
duties
of
after
-
life
;
and
partly
,
because
prudent
mammas
have
not
unfrequently
been
known
to
turn
this
circumstance
to
wonderfully
good
account
in
matrimonial
speculations
.
   
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
loan
of
the
monthly
boxes
(
which
are
always
painted
blue
,
with
the
name
of
the
society
in
large
white
letters
on
the
lid
)
,
the
society
dispense
occasional
grants
of
beef
-
tea
,
and
a
composition
of
warm
beer
,
spice
,
eggs
,
and
sugar
,
commonly
known
by
the
name
of
"
candle
,
"
to
its
patients
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
again
the
services
of
the
honorary
members
are
called
into
requisition
,
and
most
cheerfully
conceded
.
 
<EOS>
Deputations
of
twos
or
threes
are
sent
out
to
visit
the
patients
,
and
on
these
occasions
there
is
such
a
tasting
of
candle
and
beef
-
tea
,
such
a
stirring
about
of
little
messes
in
tiny
saucepans
on
the
hob
,
such
a
dressing
and
undressing
of
infants
,
such
a
tying
,
and
folding
,
and
pinning
;
such
a
nursing
and
warming
of
little
legs
and
feet
before
the
fire
,
such
a
delightful
confusion
of
talking
and
cooking
,
bustle
,
importance
,
and
officiousness
,
as
never
can
be
enjoyed
in
its
full
extent
but
on
similar
occasions
.
   
<EOS>
In
rivalry
of
these
two
institutions
,
and
as
a
last
expiring
effort
to
acquire
parochial
popularity
,
the
child
's
examination
people
determined
,
the
other
day
,
on
having
a
grand
public
examination
of
the
pupils
;
and
the
large
school
-
room
of
the
national
seminary
was
,
by
and
with
the
consent
of
the
parish
authorities
,
devoted
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Invitation
circulars
were
forwarded
to
all
the
principal
parishioners
,
including
,
of
course
,
the
heads
of
the
other
two
societies
,
for
whose
especial
behoof
and
edification
<EOS>
the
display
was
intended
;
and
a
large
audience
was
confidently
anticipated
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
The
floor
was
carefully
scrubbed
the
day
before
,
under
the
immediate
superintendence
of
the
three
Miss
Browns
;
forms
were
placed
across
the
room
for
the
accommodation
of
the
visitors
,
specimens
in
writing
were
carefully
selected
,
and
as
carefully
patched
and
touched
up
,
until
they
astonished
the
children
who
had
written
them
,
rather
more
than
the
company
who
read
them
;
sums
in
compound
addition
were
rehearsed
and
re
-
rehearsed
until
all
the
children
had
the
totals
by
heart
;
and
the
preparations
altogether
were
on
the
most
laborious
and
most
comprehensive
scale
.
 
<EOS>
The
morning
arrived
:
 
the
children
were
yellow
-
soaped
and
flannelled
,
and
towelled
,
till
their
faces
shone
again
;
every
pupil
's
hair
was
carefully
combed
into
his
or
her
eyes
,
as
the
case
might
be
;
the
girls
were
adorned
with
snow
-
white
tippets
,
and
caps
bound
round
the
head
by
a
single
purple
ribbon
:
 
<EOS>
the
necks
of
the
elder
boys
were
fixed
into
collars
of
startling
dimensions
.
   
<EOS>
The
doors
were
thrown
open
,
and
the
Misses
Brown
and
Co.
were
discovered
in
plain
white
muslin
dresses
,
and
caps
of
the
same
---
the
child
's
examination
uniform
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
filled
:
 
the
greetings
of
the
company
were
loud
and
cordial
.
 
<EOS>
The
distributionists
trembled
,
for
their
popularity
was
at
stake
.
 
<EOS>
The
eldest
boy
fell
forward
,
and
delivered
a
propitiatory
address
from
behind
his
collar
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
from
the
pen
of
Mr
Henry
Brown
;
the
applause
was
universal
,
and
the
Johnson
Parkers
were
aghast
.
 
<EOS>
The
examination
proceeded
with
success
,
and
terminated
in
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
's
examination
society
gained
a
momentary
victory
,
and
the
Johnson
Parkers
retreated
in
despair
.
   
<EOS>
A
secret
council
of
the
distributionists
was
held
that
night
,
with
Mrs
Johnson
Parker
in
the
chair
,
to
consider
of
the
best
means
of
recovering
the
ground
they
had
lost
in
the
favour
of
the
parish
.
<EOS>
What
could
be
done
?
 
<EOS>
Another
meeting
!
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
who
was
to
attend
it
?
<EOS>
The
Missionary
would
not
do
twice
;
and
the
slaves
were
emancipated
.
<EOS>
A
bold
step
must
be
taken
.
 
<EOS>
The
parish
must
be
astonished
in
some
way
or
other
;
but
no
one
was
able
to
suggest
what
the
step
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
very
old
lady
was
heard
to
mumble
,
in
indistinct
tones
,
"
Exeter
Hall
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
sudden
light
broke
in
upon
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
It
was
unanimously
resolved
,
that
a
deputation
of
old
ladies
should
wait
upon
a
celebrated
orator
,
imploring
his
assistance
,
and
the
favour
of
a
speech
;
and
the
deputation
should
also
wait
on
two
or
three
other
imbecile
old
women
,
not
resident
in
the
parish
,
and
entreat
their
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
The
application
was
successful
,
the
meeting
was
held
;
the
orator
(
an
Irishman
)
came
.
 
<EOS>
He
talked
of
green
isles
---
other
shores
---
vast
Atlantic
---
bosom
of
the
deep
---
Christian
charity
---
blood
and
extermination
---
mercy
in
hearts
---
arms
in
hands
---
altars
and
homes
---
household
gods
.
 
<EOS>
He
wiped
his
eyes
,
he
blew
his
nose
,
and
he
quoted
Latin
.
 
<EOS>
The
effect
was
tremendous
---
the
Latin
was
a
decided
hit
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
knew
exactly
what
it
was
about
,
but
everybody
knew
it
must
be
affecting
,
because
even
the
orator
was
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
The
popularity
of
the
distribution
society
among
the
ladies
of
our
parish
is
unprecedented
;
and
the
child
's
examination
is
going
fast
to
decay
.
   
<EOS>
Our
next
-
door
neighbour
<EOS>
We
are
very
fond
of
speculating
as
we
walk
through
a
street
,
on
the
character
and
pursuits
of
the
people
who
inhabit
it
;
and
nothing
so
materially
assists
us
in
these
speculations
as
the
appearance
of
the
house
doors
.
 
<EOS>
The
various
expressions
of
the
human
countenance
afford
a
beautiful
and
interesting
study
;
but
there
is
something
in
the
physiognomy
of
street
-
door
knockers
,
almost
as
characteristic
,
and
nearly
as
infallible
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
we
visit
a
man
for
the
first
time
,
we
contemplate
the
features
of
his
knocker
with
the
greatest
curiosity
,
for
we
well
know
,
that
between
the
man
and
his
knocker
,
there
will
inevitably
be
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
resemblance
and
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
For
instance
,
there
is
one
description
of
knocker
that
used
to
be
common
enough
,
but
which
is
fast
passing
away
---
a
large
round
one
,
with
the
jolly
face
of
a
convivial
lion
smiling
blandly
at
you
,
as
you
twist
the
sides
of
your
hair
into
a
curl
or
pull
up
your
shirt
-
collar
while
you
are
waiting
for
the
door
to
be
opened
;
we
never
saw
that
knocker
on
the
door
of
a
churlish
man
---
so
far
as
our
experience
is
concerned
,
it
invariably
bespoke
hospitality
and
another
bottle
.
   
<EOS>
No
man
ever
saw
this
knocker
on
the
door
of
a
small
attorney
or
bill
-
broker
;
they
always
patronise
the
other
lion
;
a
heavy
ferocious
-
looking
fellow
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
savage
stupidity
---
a
sort
of
grand
master
among
the
knockers
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
the
selfish
and
brutal
.
   
<EOS>
Then
there
is
a
little
pert
Egyptian
knocker
,
with
a
long
thin
face
,
a
pinched
-
up
nose
,
and
a
very
sharp
chin
;
he
is
most
in
vogue
with
your
government
-
office
people
,
in
light
drabs
and
starched
cravats
;
little
spare
,
priggish
men
,
who
are
perfectly
satisfied
with
their
own
opinions
,
and
consider
themselves
of
paramount
importance
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
greatly
troubled
a
few
years
ago
,
by
the
innovation
of
a
new
kind
of
knocker
,
without
any
face
at
all
,
composed
of
a
wreath
depending
from
a
hand
or
small
truncheon
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
trouble
and
attention
,
however
,
enabled
us
to
overcome
this
difficulty
,
and
to
reconcile
the
new
system
to
our
favourite
theory
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
invariably
find
this
knocker
on
the
doors
of
cold
and
formal
people
,
who
always
ask
you
why
you
DON'T
come
,
and
never
say
DO
.
   
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
the
brass
knocker
is
common
to
suburban
villas
,
and
extensive
boarding
-
schools
;
and
having
noticed
this
genus
we
have
recapitulated
all
the
most
prominent
and
strongly
-
defined
species
.
   
<EOS>
Some
phrenologists
affirm
,
that
the
agitation
of
a
man
's
brain
by
different
passions
,
produces
corresponding
developments
in
the
form
of
his
skull
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
let
us
be
understood
as
pushing
our
theory
to
the
full
length
of
asserting
,
that
any
alteration
in
a
man
's
disposition
would
produce
a
visible
effect
on
the
feature
of
his
knocker
.
 
<EOS>
Our
position
merely
is
,
that
in
such
a
case
,
the
magnetism
which
must
exist
between
a
man
and
his
knocker
,
would
induce
the
man
to
remove
,
and
seek
some
knocker
more
congenial
to
his
altered
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
ever
find
a
man
changing
his
habitation
without
any
reasonable
pretext
,
depend
upon
it
,
that
,
although
he
may
not
be
aware
of
the
fact
himself
,
it
is
because
he
and
his
knocker
are
at
variance
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
new
theory
,
but
we
venture
to
launch
it
,
nevertheless
,
as
being
quite
as
ingenious
and
infallible
as
many
thousands
of
the
learned
speculations
which
are
daily
broached
for
public
good
and
private
fortune
-
making
.
   
<EOS>
Entertaining
these
feelings
on
the
subject
of
knockers
,
it
will
be
readily
imagined
with
what
consternation
we
viewed
the
entire
removal
of
the
knocker
from
the
door
of
the
next
house
to
the
one
we
lived
in
,
some
time
ago
,
and
the
substitution
of
a
bell
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
calamity
we
had
never
anticipated
.
 
<EOS>
The
bare
idea
of
anybody
being
able
to
exist
without
a
knocker
,
appeared
so
wild
and
visionary
,
that
it
had
never
for
one
instant
entered
our
imagination
.
   
<EOS>
We
sauntered
moodily
from
the
spot
,
and
bent
our
steps
towards
Eaton
-
square
,
then
just
building
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
our
astonishment
and
indignation
to
find
that
bells
were
fast
becoming
the
rule
,
and
knockers
the
exception
!
 
<EOS>
Our
theory
trembled
beneath
the
shock
.
 
<EOS>
We
hastened
home
;
and
fancying
we
foresaw
in
the
swift
progress
of
events
,
its
entire
abolition
,
resolved
from
that
day
forward
to
vent
our
speculations
on
our
next
-
door
neighbours
in
person
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
adjoining
ours
on
the
left
hand
was
uninhabited
,
and
we
had
,
therefore
,
plenty
of
leisure
to
observe
our
next
-
door
neighbours
on
the
other
side
.
   
<EOS>
The
house
without
the
knocker
was
in
the
occupation
of
a
city
clerk
,
and
there
was
a
neatly
-
written
bill
in
the
parlour
window
intimating
that
lodgings
for
a
single
gentleman
were
to
be
let
within
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
neat
,
dull
little
house
,
on
the
shady
side
of
the
way
,
with
new
,
narrow
floorcloth
in
the
passage
,
and
new
,
narrow
stair
-
carpets
up
to
the
first
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
paper
was
new
,
and
the
paint
was
new
,
and
the
furniture
was
new
;
and
all
three
,
paper
,
paint
,
and
furniture
,
bespoke
the
limited
means
of
the
tenant
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
red
and
black
carpet
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
with
a
border
of
flooring
all
the
way
round
;
a
few
stained
chairs
and
a
pembroke
table
.
 
<EOS>
A
pink
shell
was
displayed
on
each
of
the
little
sideboards
,
which
,
with
the
addition
of
a
tea
-
tray
and
caddy
,
a
few
more
shells
on
the
mantelpiece
,
and
three
peacock
's
feathers
tastefully
arranged
above
them
,
completed
the
decorative
furniture
of
the
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
room
destined
for
the
reception
of
the
single
gentleman
during
the
day
,
and
a
little
back
room
on
the
same
floor
was
assigned
as
his
sleeping
apartment
by
night
.
   
<EOS>
The
bill
had
not
been
long
in
the
window
,
when
a
stout
,
good
-
humoured
looking
gentleman
,
of
about
five
-
and
-
thirty
,
appeared
as
a
candidate
for
the
tenancy
.
 
<EOS>
Terms
were
soon
arranged
,
for
the
bill
was
taken
down
immediately
after
his
first
visit
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
day
or
two
the
single
gentleman
came
in
,
and
shortly
afterwards
his
real
character
came
out
.
   
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
he
displayed
a
most
extraordinary
partiality
for
sitting
up
till
three
or
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
drinking
whiskey
-
and
-
water
,
and
smoking
cigars
;
then
he
invited
friends
home
,
who
used
to
come
at
ten
o'clock
,
and
begin
to
get
happy
about
the
small
hours
,
when
they
evinced
their
perfect
contentment
by
singing
songs
with
half
-
a
-
dozen
verses
of
two
lines
each
,
and
a
chorus
of
ten
,
which
chorus
used
to
be
shouted
forth
by
the
whole
strength
of
the
company
,
in
the
most
enthusiastic
and
vociferous
manner
,
to
the
great
annoyance
of
the
neighbours
,
and
the
special
discomfort
of
another
single
gentleman
overhead
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
this
was
bad
enough
,
occurring
as
it
did
three
times
a
week
on
the
average
,
but
this
was
not
all
;
for
when
the
company
DID
go
away
,
instead
of
walking
quietly
down
the
street
,
as
anybody
else
's
company
would
have
done
,
they
amused
themselves
by
making
alarming
and
frightful
noises
,
and
counterfeiting
the
shrieks
of
females
in
distress
;
and
one
night
,
a
red
-
faced
gentleman
in
a
white
hat
knocked
in
the
most
urgent
manner
at
the
door
of
the
powdered
-
headed
old
gentleman
at
No
.
3
,
and
when
the
powdered
-
headed
old
gentleman
,
who
thought
one
of
his
married
daughters
must
have
been
taken
ill
prematurely
,
had
groped
down
-
stairs
,
and
<EOS>
after
a
great
deal
of
unbolting
and
key
-
turning
,
opened
the
street
door
,
the
red
-
faced
man
in
the
white
hat
said
he
hoped
he
'd
excuse
his
giving
him
so
much
trouble
,
but
he
'd
feel
obliged
if
he
'd
favour
him
with
a
glass
of
cold
spring
water
,
and
the
loan
of
a
shilling
for
a
cab
to
take
him
home
,
on
which
the
old
gentleman
slammed
the
door
and
went
up
-
stairs
,
and
threw
the
contents
of
his
water
jug
out
of
window
---
very
straight
,
only
it
went
over
the
wrong
man
;
and
the
whole
street
was
involved
in
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
A
joke
's
a
joke
;
and
even
practical
jests
are
very
capital
in
their
way
,
if
you
can
only
get
the
other
party
to
see
the
fun
of
them
;
but
the
population
of
our
street
were
so
dull
of
apprehension
,
as
to
be
quite
lost
to
a
sense
of
the
drollery
of
this
proceeding
:
and
the
consequence
was
,
that
our
next
-
door
neighbour
was
obliged
to
tell
the
single
gentleman
,
that
unless
he
gave
up
entertaining
his
friends
at
home
,
he
really
must
be
compelled
to
part
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
single
gentleman
received
the
remonstrance
with
great
good
-
humour
,
and
promised
from
that
time
forward
,
to
spend
his
evenings
at
a
coffee
-
house
---
a
determination
which
afforded
general
and
unmixed
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
night
passed
off
very
well
,
everybody
being
delighted
with
the
change
;
but
on
the
next
,
the
noises
were
renewed
with
greater
spirit
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
The
single
gentleman
's
friends
being
unable
to
see
him
in
his
own
house
every
alternate
night
,
had
come
to
the
determination
of
seeing
him
home
every
night
;
and
what
with
the
discordant
greetings
of
the
friends
at
parting
,
and
the
noise
created
by
the
single
gentleman
in
his
passage
up
-
stairs
,
and
his
subsequent
struggles
to
get
his
boots
off
,
the
evil
was
not
to
be
borne
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
our
next
-
door
neighbour
gave
the
single
gentleman
,
who
was
a
very
good
lodger
in
other
respects
,
notice
to
quit
;
and
the
single
gentleman
went
away
,
and
entertained
his
friends
in
other
lodgings
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
applicant
for
the
vacant
first
floor
,
was
of
a
very
different
character
from
the
troublesome
single
gentleman
who
had
just
quitted
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
thin
,
young
gentleman
,
with
a
profusion
of
brown
hair
,
reddish
whiskers
,
and
very
slightly
developed
moustaches
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
a
braided
surtout
,
with
frogs
behind
,
light
grey
trousers
,
and
wash
-
leather
gloves
,
and
had
altogether
rather
a
military
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
So
unlike
the
roystering
single
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Such
insinuating
manners
,
and
such
a
delightful
address
!
 
<EOS>
So
seriously
disposed
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
When
he
first
came
to
look
at
the
lodgings
,
he
inquired
most
particularly
whether
he
was
sure
to
be
able
to
get
a
seat
in
the
parish
church
;
and
when
he
had
agreed
to
take
them
,
he
requested
to
have
a
list
of
the
different
local
charities
,
as
he
intended
to
subscribe
his
mite
to
the
most
deserving
among
them
.
   
<EOS>
Our
next
-
door
neighbour
was
now
perfectly
happy
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
got
a
lodger
at
last
,
of
just
his
own
way
of
thinking
---
a
serious
,
well
-
disposed
man
,
who
abhorred
gaiety
,
and
loved
retirement
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
down
the
bill
with
a
light
heart
,
and
pictured
in
imagination
a
long
series
of
quiet
Sundays
,
on
which
he
and
his
lodger
would
exchange
mutual
civilities
and
Sunday
papers
.
   
<EOS>
The
serious
man
arrived
,
and
his
luggage
was
to
arrive
from
the
country
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
borrowed
a
clean
shirt
,
and
a
prayer
-
book
,
from
our
next
-
door
neighbour
,
and
retired
to
rest
at
an
early
hour
,
requesting
that
he
might
be
called
punctually
at
ten
o'clock
next
morning
---
not
before
,
as
he
was
much
fatigued
.
   
<EOS>
He
WAS
called
,
and
did
not
answer
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
called
again
,
but
there
was
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Our
next
-
door
neighbour
became
alarmed
,
and
burst
the
door
open
.
 
<EOS>
The
serious
man
had
left
the
house
mysteriously
;
carrying
with
him
the
shirt
,
the
prayer
-
book
,
a
teaspoon
,
and
the
bedclothes
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
this
occurrence
,
coupled
with
the
irregularities
of
his
former
lodger
,
gave
our
next
-
door
neighbour
an
aversion
to
single
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
we
know
not
;
we
only
know
that
the
next
bill
which
made
its
appearance
in
the
parlour
window
intimated
generally
,
that
there
were
furnished
apartments
to
let
on
the
first
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
bill
was
soon
removed
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
lodgers
at
first
attracted
our
curiosity
,
and
afterwards
excited
our
interest
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
a
young
lad
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
,
and
his
mother
,
a
lady
of
about
fifty
,
or
it
might
be
less
.
 
<EOS>
The
mother
wore
a
widow
's
weeds
,
and
the
boy
was
also
clothed
in
deep
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
poor
---
very
poor
;
for
their
only
means
of
support
arose
from
the
pittance
the
boy
earned
,
by
copying
writings
,
and
translating
for
booksellers
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
removed
from
some
country
place
and
settled
in
London
;
partly
because
it
afforded
better
chances
of
employment
for
the
boy
,
and
partly
,
perhaps
,
with
the
natural
desire
to
leave
a
place
where
they
had
been
in
better
circumstances
,
and
where
their
poverty
was
known
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
proud
under
their
reverses
,
and
above
revealing
their
wants
and
privations
to
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
How
bitter
those
privations
were
,
and
how
hard
the
boy
worked
to
remove
them
,
no
one
ever
knew
but
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Night
after
night
,
two
,
three
,
four
hours
after
midnight
,
could
we
hear
the
occasional
raking
up
of
the
scanty
fire
,
or
the
hollow
and
half
-
stifled
cough
,
which
indicated
his
being
still
at
work
;
and
day
after
day
,
<EOS>
could
we
see
more
plainly
that
nature
had
set
that
unearthly
light
in
his
plaintive
face
,
which
is
the
beacon
of
her
worst
disease
.
   
<EOS>
Actuated
,
we
hope
,
by
a
higher
feeling
than
mere
curiosity
,
we
contrived
to
establish
,
<EOS>
first
an
acquaintance
,
and
then
a
close
intimacy
,
with
the
poor
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
Our
worst
fears
were
realised
;
the
boy
was
sinking
fast
.
 
<EOS>
Through
a
part
of
the
winter
,
and
the
whole
of
the
following
spring
and
summer
,
his
labours
were
unceasingly
prolonged
:
 
and
the
mother
attempted
to
procure
needle
-
work
,
embroidery
---
anything
for
bread
.
   
<EOS>
A
few
shillings
now
and
then
,
were
all
she
could
earn
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
worked
steadily
on
;
dying
by
minutes
,
but
never
once
giving
utterance
to
complaint
or
murmur
.
   
<EOS>
One
beautiful
autumn
evening
we
went
to
pay
our
customary
visit
to
the
invalid
.
 
<EOS>
His
little
remaining
strength
had
been
decreasing
rapidly
for
two
or
three
days
preceding
,
and
he
was
lying
on
the
sofa
at
the
open
window
,
gazing
at
the
setting
sun
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
had
been
reading
the
Bible
to
him
,
for
she
closed
the
book
as
we
entered
,
and
advanced
to
meet
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
telling
William
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
we
must
manage
to
take
him
into
the
country
somewhere
,
so
that
he
may
get
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
ill
,
you
know
,
but
he
is
not
very
strong
,
and
has
exerted
himself
too
much
lately
.
"
 
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
The
tears
that
streamed
through
her
fingers
,
as
she
turned
aside
,
as
if
to
adjust
her
close
widow
's
cap
,
too
plainly
showed
how
fruitless
was
the
attempt
to
deceive
herself
.
   
<EOS>
We
sat
down
by
the
head
of
the
sofa
,
but
said
nothing
,
for
we
saw
the
breath
of
life
was
passing
gently
but
rapidly
from
the
young
form
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
At
every
respiration
,
his
heart
beat
more
slowly
.
   
<EOS>
The
boy
placed
one
hand
in
ours
,
grasped
his
mother
's
arm
with
the
other
,
drew
her
hastily
towards
him
,
and
fervently
kissed
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
He
sunk
back
upon
his
pillow
,
and
looked
long
and
earnestly
in
his
mother
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
William
,
William
!
"
murmured
the
mother
,
after
a
long
interval
,
"
do
n't
look
at
me
so
---
speak
to
me
,
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
boy
smiled
languidly
,
but
an
instant
afterwards
his
features
resolved
into
the
same
cold
,
solemn
gaze
.
   
<EOS>
"
William
,
dear
William
!
<EOS>
rouse
yourself
;
do
n't
look
at
me
so
,
love
---
<EOS>
pray
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
widow
,
clasping
her
hands
in
agony
---
"
my
dear
boy
!
<EOS>
he
is
dying
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
boy
raised
himself
by
a
violent
effort
,
and
folded
his
hands
together
---
"
Mother
!
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
mother
,
bury
me
in
the
open
fields
---
anywhere
but
in
these
dreadful
streets
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
where
you
can
see
my
grave
,
but
not
in
these
close
crowded
streets
;
they
have
killed
me
;
kiss
me
again
,
mother
;
put
your
arm
round
my
neck
---
"
   
<EOS>
He
fell
back
,
and
a
strange
expression
stole
upon
his
features
;
not
of
pain
or
suffering
,
but
an
indescribable
fixing
of
every
line
and
muscle
.
   
<EOS>
The
boy
was
dead
.

SCENES
 
<EOS>
The
streets
---
morning
The
appearance
presented
by
the
streets
of
London
an
hour
before
sunrise
,
on
a
summer
's
morning
,
is
most
striking
even
to
the
few
whose
unfortunate
pursuits
of
pleasure
,
or
scarcely
less
unfortunate
pursuits
of
business
,
cause
them
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
air
of
cold
,
solitary
desolation
about
the
noiseless
streets
which
we
are
accustomed
to
see
thronged
at
other
times
by
a
busy
,
eager
crowd
,
and
over
the
quiet
,
closely
-
shut
buildings
,
which
throughout
the
day
are
swarming
with
life
and
bustle
,
that
is
very
impressive
.
   
<EOS>
The
last
drunken
man
,
who
shall
find
his
way
home
before
sunlight
,
has
just
staggered
heavily
along
,
roaring
out
the
burden
of
the
drinking
song
of
the
previous
night
:
 
the
last
houseless
vagrant
whom
penury
and
police
have
left
in
the
streets
,
has
coiled
up
his
chilly
limbs
in
some
paved
comer
,
to
dream
of
food
and
warmth
.
 
<EOS>
The
drunken
,
the
dissipated
,
and
the
wretched
have
disappeared
;
the
more
sober
and
orderly
part
of
the
population
have
not
yet
awakened
to
the
labours
of
the
day
,
and
the
stillness
of
death
is
over
the
streets
;
its
very
hue
seems
to
be
imparted
to
them
,
cold
and
lifeless
as
they
look
in
the
grey
,
sombre
light
of
daybreak
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
-
stands
in
the
larger
thoroughfares
are
deserted
:
 
the
night
-
houses
are
closed
;
and
the
chosen
promenades
of
profligate
misery
are
empty
.
   
<EOS>
An
occasional
policeman
may
alone
be
seen
at
the
street
corners
,
listlessly
gazing
on
the
deserted
prospect
before
him
;
and
now
and
then
a
rakish
-
looking
cat
runs
stealthily
across
the
road
and
descends
his
own
area
with
as
much
caution
and
slyness
---
bounding
first
on
the
water
-
butt
,
then
on
the
dust
-
hole
,
and
then
alighting
on
the
flag
-
stones
---
as
if
he
were
conscious
that
his
character
depended
on
his
gallantry
of
the
preceding
night
escaping
public
observation
.
 
<EOS>
A
partially
opened
bedroom
-
window
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
bespeaks
the
heat
of
the
weather
,
and
the
uneasy
slumbers
of
its
occupant
;
and
the
dim
scanty
flicker
of
the
rushlight
,
through
the
window
-
blind
,
denotes
the
chamber
of
watching
or
sickness
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
few
exceptions
,
the
streets
present
no
signs
of
life
,
nor
the
houses
of
habitation
.
   
<EOS>
An
hour
wears
away
;
the
spires
of
the
churches
and
roofs
of
the
principal
buildings
are
faintly
tinged
with
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
;
and
the
streets
,
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
,
begin
to
resume
their
bustle
and
animation
.
 
<EOS>
Market
-
carts
roll
slowly
along
:
the
sleepy
waggoner
impatiently
urging
on
his
tired
horses
,
or
vainly
endeavouring
to
awaken
the
boy
,
who
,
luxuriously
stretched
on
the
top
of
the
fruit
-
baskets
,
forgets
,
in
happy
oblivion
,
his
long
-
cherished
curiosity
to
behold
the
wonders
of
London
.
   
<EOS>
Rough
,
sleepy
-
looking
animals
of
strange
appearance
,
something
between
ostlers
and
hackney
-
coachmen
,
begin
to
take
down
the
shutters
of
early
public
-
houses
;
and
little
deal
tables
,
with
the
ordinary
preparations
for
a
street
breakfast
,
make
their
appearance
at
the
customary
stations
.
 
<EOS>
Numbers
of
men
and
women
(
principally
the
latter
)
,
carrying
upon
their
heads
heavy
baskets
of
fruit
,
toil
down
the
park
side
of
Piccadilly
,
on
their
way
to
Covent
-
garden
,
and
,
following
each
other
in
rapid
succession
,
form
a
long
straggling
line
from
thence
to
the
turn
of
the
road
at
Knightsbridge
.
   
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
a
bricklayer
's
labourer
,
with
the
day
's
dinner
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
,
walks
briskly
to
his
work
,
and
occasionally
a
little
knot
of
three
or
four
schoolboys
on
a
stolen
bathing
expedition
rattle
merrily
over
the
pavement
,
<EOS>
their
boisterous
mirth
contrasting
forcibly
with
the
demeanour
of
the
little
sweep
,
who
,
having
knocked
and
rung
till
his
arm
aches
,
and
being
interdicted
by
a
merciful
legislature
from
endangering
his
lungs
by
calling
out
,
sits
patiently
down
on
the
door
-
step
,
until
the
housemaid
may
happen
to
awake
.
   
<EOS>
Covent
-
garden
market
,
and
the
avenues
leading
to
it
,
are
thronged
with
carts
of
all
sorts
,
sizes
,
and
descriptions
,
from
the
heavy
lumbering
waggon
,
with
its
four
stout
horses
,
to
the
jingling
costermonger
's
cart
,
with
its
consumptive
donkey
.
 
<EOS>
The
pavement
is
already
strewed
with
decayed
cabbage
-
leaves
,
broken
hay
-
bands
,
and
all
the
indescribable
litter
of
a
vegetable
market
;
men
are
shouting
,
carts
backing
,
horses
neighing
,
boys
fighting
,
basket
-
women
talking
,
piemen
expatiating
on
the
excellence
of
their
pastry
,
and
donkeys
braying
.
 
<EOS>
These
and
a
hundred
other
sounds
form
a
compound
discordant
enough
to
a
Londoner
's
ears
,
and
remarkably
disagreeable
to
those
of
country
gentlemen
who
are
sleeping
at
the
Hummums
for
the
first
time
.
   
<EOS>
Another
hour
passes
away
,
and
the
day
begins
in
good
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
The
servant
of
all
work
,
who
,
under
the
plea
of
sleeping
very
soundly
,
has
utterly
disregarded
"
Missis
's
"
ringing
for
half
an
hour
previously
,
is
warned
by
Master
(
whom
Missis
has
sent
up
in
his
drapery
to
the
landing
-
place
for
that
purpose
)
,
that
it
's
half
-
past
six
,
whereupon
she
awakes
all
of
a
sudden
,
with
well
-
feigned
astonishment
,
and
goes
down
-
stairs
very
sulkily
,
wishing
,
while
she
strikes
a
light
,
that
the
principle
of
spontaneous
combustion
would
extend
itself
to
coals
and
kitchen
range
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
fire
is
lighted
,
she
opens
the
street
-
door
to
take
in
the
milk
,
when
,
by
the
most
singular
coincidence
in
the
world
,
she
discovers
that
the
servant
next
door
has
just
taken
in
her
milk
too
,
and
that
Mr
Todd
's
young
man
over
the
way
,
is
,
by
an
equally
extraordinary
chance
,
taking
down
his
master
's
shutters
.
 
<EOS>
The
inevitable
consequence
is
,
that
she
just
steps
,
milk
-
jug
in
hand
,
as
far
as
next
door
,
just
to
say
"
good
morning
"
to
Betsy
Clark
,
and
that
Mr
Todd
's
young
man
just
steps
over
the
way
to
say
"
good
morning
"
to
both
of
'em
;
and
as
the
aforesaid
Mr
Todd
's
young
man
is
almost
as
good
-
looking
and
fascinating
as
the
baker
himself
,
the
conversation
quickly
becomes
very
interesting
,
and
probably
would
become
more
so
,
if
Betsy

her
about

did
n't
give
an
angry
tap
at
her
bedroom
window
,
on
which
Mr
Todd
's
young
man
tries
to
whistle
coolly
,
as
he
goes
back
to
his
shop
much
faster
than
he
came
from
it
;
and
the
two
girls
run
back
to
their
respective
places
,
and
shut
their
street
-
doors
with
surprising
softness
,
each
of
them
poking
their
heads
out
of
the
front
parlour
window
,
a
minute
afterwards
,
however
,
ostensibly
with
the
view
of
looking
at
the
mail
which
just
then
passes
by
,
but
really
for
the
purpose
of
catching
another
glimpse
of
Mr
Todd
's
young
man
,
who
being
fond
of
mails
,
but
more
of
females
,
takes
a
short
look
at
the
mails
,
and
a
long
look
at
the
girls
,
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
concerned
.
   
<EOS>
The
mail
itself
goes
on
to
the
coach
-
office
in
due
course
,
and
the
passengers
who
are
going
out
by
the
early
coach
,
stare
with
astonishment
at
the
passengers
who
are
coming
in
by
the
early
coach
,
who
look
blue
and
dismal
,
and
are
evidently
under
the
influence
of
that
odd
feeling
produced
by
travelling
,
which
makes
the
events
of
yesterday
morning
seem
as
if
they
had
happened
at
least
six
months
ago
,
and
induces
people
to
wonder
with
considerable
gravity
whether
the
friends
and
relations
they
took
leave
of
a
fortnight
before
,
have
altered
much
since
they
have
left
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
-
office
is
all
alive
,
and
the
coaches
which
are
just
going
out
,
are
surrounded
by
the
usual
crowd
of
Jews
and
nondescripts
,
who
seem
to
consider
,
Heaven
knows
why
,
that
it
is
quite
impossible
any
man
can
mount
a
coach
without
requiring
at
least
sixpenny
-
worth
of
oranges
,
a
penknife
,
a
pocket
-
book
,
a
last

a

a
piece
of
sponge

Half
an
hour
more
,
and
the
sun
darts
his
bright
rays
cheerfully
down
the
still
half
-
empty
streets
,
and
shines
with
sufficient
force
to
rouse
the
dismal
laziness
of
the
apprentice
,
who
pauses
every
other
minute
from
his
task
of
sweeping
out
the
shop
and
watering
the
pavement
in
front
of
it
,
to
tell
another
apprentice
similarly
employed
,
how
hot
it
will
be
to

day
,
or
to
stand
with
his
right
hand
shading
his
eyes

his

resting

gazing
at
the

envying
the

on
the
outside
of
the
fast
coach

and
thinking
of
the
old
red
brick
house
"
down
in

where
he
went
to
school
:
 
<EOS>
the
miseries
of
the
milk

and
thick
bread
and
scrapings

fading
into
nothing
before
the
pleasant
recollection
of
the
green

the

play

But
the
streets

very
height

should
be
seen
on
a
dark

dull

murky
winter

night

when
there
is
just
enough
damp
gently
stealing
down
to
make
the
pavement
greasy
,
without
cleansing
it
of
any
of
its
impurities
;
and
when
the
heavy
lazy
mist
,
which
hangs
over
every
object
,
makes
the
gas

lamps
look
brighter

and
the
brilliantly

more
splendid

from
the
contrast

present

All
the
people

are
at
home
on
such
a
night
as
this

seem
disposed
to
make
themselves
as
snug

comfortable
as
possible

the
passengers
in

have
excellent
reason
to
envy
the
fortunate

In

In

the

rings
his

opened

puts
her

out

Mrs

has
scarcely
got
the
words
out

than
Mrs

,
over
the

lets
loose
Master

who
darts
down
the
street

with
a
velocity
which
nothing

buttered
muffins

could
possibly
inspire

and
drags
the

back
by
main
force

whereupon
Mrs

Mrs

,
just
to
save
the

trouble

to
say
a
few
neighbourly
words

Mrs

run
over

buy
their

After

Master

Mrs

sees
her

as

after

from

she
instantly
runs
across

muffins

Mrs

does
the

after
a
few
words
to
Mrs

they
all
pop
into

<EOS>
The
crowds
which
have
been
passing
to
and
fro
during
the
whole
day
,
are
rapidly
dwindling
away
;
and
the
noise
of
shouting
and
quarrelling
which
issues
from
the
public
-
houses
,
is
almost
the
only
sound
that
breaks
the
melancholy
stillness
of
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
,
but
it
has
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
That
wretched
woman
with
the
infant
in
her
arms
,
<EOS>
round
whose
meagre
form
the
remnant
of
her
own
scanty
shawl
is
carefully
wrapped
,
has
been
attempting
to
sing
some
popular
ballad
,
in
the
hope
of
wringing
a
few
pence
from
the
compassionate
passer
-
by
.
 
<EOS>
A
brutal
laugh
at
her
weak
voice
is
all
she
has
gained
.
 
<EOS>
The
tears
fall
thick
and
fast
down
her
own
pale
face
;
the
child
is
cold
and
hungry
,
and
its
low
half
-
stifled
wailing
adds
to
the
misery
of
its
wretched
mother
,
as
she
moans
aloud
,
and
sinks
despairingly
down
,
on
a
cold
damp
door
-
step
.
   
<EOS>
Singing
!
 
<EOS>
How
few
of
those
who
pass
such
a
miserable
creature
as
this
,
think
of
the
anguish
of
heart
,
the
sinking
of
soul
and
spirit
,
which
the
very
effort
of
singing
produces
.
 
<EOS>
Bitter
mockery
!
<EOS>
Disease
,
neglect
,
and
starvation
,
faintly
articulating
the
words
of
the
joyous
ditty
,
that
has
enlivened
your
hours
of
feasting
and
merriment
,
God
knows
how
often
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
subject
of
jeering
.
 
<EOS>
The
weak
tremulous
voice
tells
a
fearful
tale
of
want
and
famishing
;
and
the
feeble
singer
of
this
roaring
song
may
turn
away
,
only
to
die
of
cold
and
hunger
.

One

Parties

through
the
muddy

cabs

roll
swiftly
by

watermen
with
dim
dirty

in
their

and
large

upon

who
have
been
shouting

retire

to

themselves
with

the

are
served
up
amidst
a
noise

confusion
of
smoking

running

knife

chattering

perfectly
indescribable
.
   
<EOS>
The
more
musical
portion
of
the
play
-
going
community
betake
themselves
to
some
harmonic
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
curiosity
let
us
follow
them
thither
for
a
few
moments
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
lofty
room
of
spacious
dimensions
,
are
seated
some
eighty
or
a
hundred
guests
knocking
little
pewter
measures
on
the
tables
,
and
hammering
away
,
with
the
handles
of
their
knives
,
as
if
they
were
so
many
trunk
-
makers
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
applauding
a
glee
,
which
has
just
been
executed
by
the
three
"
professional
gentlemen
"
at
the
top
of
the
centre
table
,
one
of
whom
is
in
the
chair
---
the
little
pompous
man
with
the
bald
head
just
emerging
from
the
collar
of
his
green
coat
.
 
<EOS>
The
others
are
seated
on
either
side
of
him
---
the
stout
man
with
the
small
voice
,
and
the
thin
-
faced
dark
man
in
black
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
man
in
the
chair
is
a
most
amusing
personage
,
---
such
condescending
grandeur
,
and
SUCH
a
voice
!
   
<EOS>
"
Bass
!
"
<EOS>
as
the
young
gentleman
near
us
with
the
blue
stock
forcibly
remarks
to
his
companion
,
"
bass
!
 
<EOS>
I
b'lieve
you
;
he
can
go
down
lower
than
any
man
:
 
so
low
sometimes
that
you
ca
n't
hear
him
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
To
hear
him
growling
away
,
gradually
lower
and
lower
down
,
till
he
ca
n't
get
back
again
,
is
the
most
delightful
thing
in
the
world
,
and
it
is
quite
impossible
to
witness
unmoved
the
impressive
solemnity
with
which
he
pours
forth
his
soul
in
"
My
"
art
's
in
the
"
ighlands
,
"
or
"
The
brave
old
Hoak
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
stout
man
is
also
addicted
to
sentimentality
,
and
warbles
"
Fly
,
fly
from
the
world
,
my
Bessy
,
with
me
,
"
or
some
such
song
,
with
lady
-
like
sweetness
,
and
in
the
most
seductive
tones
imaginable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
give
your
orders
,
gen'l'm'n
---
pray
give
your
orders
,
"
---
says
the
pale
-
faced
man
with
the
red
head
;
and
demands
for
"
goes
"
of
gin
and
"
goes
"
of
brandy
,
and
<EOS>
pints
of
stout
,
and
cigars
of
peculiar
mildness
,
are
vociferously
made
from
all
parts
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
professional
gentlemen
"
are
in
the
very
height
of
their
glory
,
and
bestow
condescending
nods
,
or
even
a
word
or
two
of
recognition
,
on
the
better
-
known
frequenters
of
the
room
,
in
the
most
bland
and
patronising
manner
possible
.
   
<EOS>
The
little
round
-
faced
man
,
with
the
small
brown
surtout
,
white
stockings
and
shoes
,
is
in
the
comic
line
;
the
mixed
air
of
self
-
denial
,
and
mental
consciousness
of
his
own
powers
,
with
which
he
acknowledges
the
call
of
the
chair
,
is
particularly
gratifying
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gen'l'men
,
"
says
the
little
pompous
man
,
accompanying
the
word
with
a
knock
of
the
president
's
hammer
on
the
table
---
"
Gen'l'men
,
allow
me
to
claim
your
attention
---
our
friend
,
Mr
Smuggins
,
will
oblige
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
Bravo
!
<EOS>
"
shout
the
company
;
and
Smuggins
,
after
a
considerable
quantity
of
coughing
by
way
of
symphony
,
and
a
most
facetious
sniff
or
two
,
which
afford
general
delight
,
sings
a
comic
song
,
with
a
fal
-
de
-
ral
---
tol
-
de
-
ral
chorus
at
the
end
of
every
verse
,
much
longer
than
the
verse
itself
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
received
with
unbounded
applause
,
and
after
some
aspiring
genius
has
volunteered
a
recitation
,
and
failed
dismally
therein
,
the
little
pompous
man
gives
another
knock
,
and
says
"
Gen'l'men
,
we
will
attempt
a
glee
,
if
you
please
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
announcement
calls
forth
tumultuous
applause
,
and
the
more
energetic
spirits
express
the
unqualified
approbation
it
affords
them
,
by
knocking
one
or
two
stout
glasses
off
their
legs
---
a
humorous
device
;
but
one
which
frequently
occasions
some
slight
altercation
when
the
form
of
paying
the
damage
is
proposed
to
be
gone
through
by
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
Scenes
like
these
are
continued
until
three
or
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
and
even
when
they
close
,
fresh
ones
open
to
the
inquisitive
novice
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
a
description
of
all
of
them
,
however
slight
,
would
require
a
volume
,
the
contents
of
which
,
however
instructive
,
would
be
by
no
means
pleasing
,
we
make
our
bow
,
and
drop
the
curtain
.
   
<EOS>
Shops
and
their
tenants
<EOS>
What
inexhaustible
food
for
speculation
,
do
the
streets
of
London
afford
!
 
<EOS>
We
never
were
able
to
agree
with
Sterne
in
pitying
the
man
who
could
travel
from
Dan
to
Beersheba
,
and
say
that
all
was
barren
;
we
have
not
the
slightest
commiseration
for
the
man
who
can
take
up
his
hat
and
stick
,
and
walk
from
Covent
-
garden
to
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
and
back
into
the
bargain
,
without
deriving
some
amusement
<EOS>
---
we
had
almost
said
instruction
---
from
his
perambulation
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
there
are
such
beings
:
 
<EOS>
we
meet
them
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Large
black
stocks
and
light
waistcoats
,
jet
canes
and
discontented
countenances
,
are
the
characteristics
of
the
race
;
other
people
brush
quickly
by
you
,
steadily
plodding
on
to
business
,
or
cheerfully
running
after
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
These
men
linger
listlessly
past
,
looking
as
happy
and
animated
as
a
policeman
on
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
seems
to
make
an
impression
on
their
minds
:
 
nothing
short
of
being
knocked
down
by
a
porter
,
or
run
over
by
a
cab
,
will
disturb
their
equanimity
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
meet
them
on
a
fine
day
in
any
of
the
leading
thoroughfares
:
 
peep
through
the
window
of
a
west
-
end
cigar
shop
in
the
evening
,
if
you
can
manage
to
get
a
glimpse
between
the
blue
curtains
which
intercept
the
vulgar
gaze
,
and
you
see
them
in
their
only
enjoyment
of
existence
.
 
<EOS>
There
they
are
lounging
about
,
on
round
tubs
and
pipe
boxes
,
in
all
the
dignity
of
whiskers
,
and
gilt
watch
-
guards
;
whispering
soft
nothings
to
the
young
lady
in
amber
,
with
the
large
ear
-
rings
,
who
,
as
she
sits
behind
the
counter
in
a
blaze
of
adoration
and
gas
-
light
,
is
the
admiration
of
all
the
female
servants
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
the
envy
of
every
milliner
's
apprentice
within
two
miles
round
.
   
<EOS>
One
of
our
principal
amusements
is
to
watch
the
gradual
progress
---
the
rise
or
fall
---
of
particular
shops
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
formed
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
several
,
in
different
parts
of
town
,
and
are
perfectly
acquainted
with
their
whole
history
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
name
off
-
hand
,
twenty
at
least
,
which
we
are
quite
sure
have
paid
no
taxes
for
the
last
six
years
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
never
inhabited
for
more
than
two
months
consecutively
,
and
,
we
verily
believe
,
have
witnessed
every
retail
trade
in
the
directory
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
one
,
whose
history
is
a
sample
of
the
rest
,
in
whose
fate
we
have
taken
especial
interest
,
having
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
it
ever
since
it
has
been
a
shop
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
on
the
Surrey
side
of
the
water
---
a
little
distance
beyond
the
Marsh
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
originally
a
substantial
,
good
-
looking
private
house
enough
;
the
landlord
got
into
difficulties
,
the
house
got
into
Chancery
,
the
tenant
went
away
,
and
the
house
went
to
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
period
our
acquaintance
with
it
commenced
;
the
paint
was
all
worn
off
;
the
windows
were
broken
,
the
area
was
green
with
neglect
and
the
overflowings
of
the
water
-
butt
;
the
butt
itself
was
without
a
lid
,
and
the
street
-
door
was
the
very
picture
of
misery
.
 
<EOS>
The
chief
pastime
of
the
children
in
the
vicinity
had
been
to
assemble
in
a
body
on
the
steps
,
and
to
take
it
in
turn
to
knock
loud
double
knocks
at
the
door
,
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
neighbours
generally
,
and
especially
of
the
nervous
old
lady
next
door
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
Numerous
complaints
were
made
,
and
several
small
basins
of
water
discharged
over
the
offenders
,
but
without
effect
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
things
,
the
marine
-
store
dealer
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
in
the
most
obliging
manner
took
the
knocker
off
,
and
sold
it
:
 
and
the
unfortunate
house
looked
more
wretched
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
We
deserted
our
friend
for
a
few
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
our
surprise
,
on
our
return
,
to
find
no
trace
of
its
existence
!
 
<EOS>
In
its
place
was
a
handsome
shop
,
fast
approaching
to
a
state
of
completion
,
and
on
the
shutters
were
large
bills
,
informing
the
public
that
it
would
shortly
be
opened
with
"
an
extensive
stock
of
linen
-
drapery
and
haberdashery
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
opened
in
due
course
;
there
was
the
name
of
the
proprietor
"
and
Co.
"
in
gilt
letters
,
almost
too
dazzling
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
Such
ribbons
and
shawls
!
<EOS>
and
two
such
elegant
young
men
behind
the
counter
,
each
in
a
clean
collar
and
white
neckcloth
,
like
the
lover
in
a
farce
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
proprietor
,
he
did
nothing
but
walk
up
and
down
the
shop
,
and
hand
seats
to
the
ladies
,
and
hold
important
conversations
with
the
handsomest
of
the
young
men
,
who
was
shrewdly
suspected
by
the
neighbours
to
be
the
<EOS>
"
Co.
"
 
We
saw
all
this
with
sorrow
;
we
felt
a
fatal
presentiment
that
the
shop
was
doomed
---
and
so
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Its
decay
was
slow
,
but
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Tickets
gradually
appeared
in
the
windows
;
then
rolls
of
flannel
,
with
labels
on
them
,
were
stuck
outside
the
door
;
then
a
bill
was
pasted
on
the
street
-
door
,
intimating
that
the
first
floor
was
to
let
unfurnished
;
then
one
of
the
young
men
disappeared
altogether
,
and
the
other
took
to
a
black
neckerchief
,
and
the
proprietor
took
to
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
The
shop
became
dirty
,
broken
panes
of
glass
remained
unmended
,
and
the
stock
disappeared
piecemeal
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
the
company
's
man
came
to
cut
off
the
water
,
and
then
the
linen
-
draper
cut
off
himself
,
leaving
the
landlord
his
compliments
and
the
key
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
occupant
was
a
fancy
stationer
.
 
<EOS>
The
shop
was
more
modestly
painted
than
before
,
still
it
was
neat
;
but
somehow
we
always
thought
,
as
we
passed
,
that
it
looked
like
a
poor
and
struggling
concern
.
 
<EOS>
We
wished
the
man
well
,
but
we
trembled
for
his
success
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
widower
evidently
,
and
had
employment
elsewhere
,
for
he
passed
us
every
morning
on
his
road
to
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
business
was
carried
on
by
his
eldest
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
needed
no
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
We
occasionally
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
or
three
children
,
in
mourning
like
herself
,
as
they
sat
in
the
little
parlour
behind
the
shop
;
and
we
never
passed
at
night
without
seeing
the
eldest
girl
at
work
,
either
for
them
,
or
in
making
some
elegant
little
trifle
for
sale
.
 
<EOS>
We
often
thought
,
as
her
pale
face
looked
more
sad
and
pensive
in
the
dim
candle
-
light
,
that
if
those
thoughtless
females
who
interfere
with
the
miserable
market
of
poor
creatures
such
as
these
,
knew
but
one
-
half
of
the
misery
they
suffer
,
and
the
bitter
privations
they
endure
,
in
their
honourable
attempts
to
earn
a
scanty
subsistence
,
they
would
,
perhaps
,
resign
even
opportunities
for
the
gratification
of
vanity
,
and
an
immodest
love
of
self
-
display
,
rather
than
drive
them
to
a
last
dreadful
resource
,
which
it
would
shock
the
delicate
feelings
of
these
CHARITABLE
ladies
to
hear
named
.
   
<EOS>
But
we
are
forgetting
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
we
continued
to
watch
it
,
and
every
day
showed
too
clearly
the
increasing
poverty
of
its
inmates
.
 
<EOS>
The
children
were
clean
,
it
is
true
,
but
their
clothes
were
threadbare
and
shabby
;
no
tenant
had
been
procured
for
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
from
the
letting
of
which
,
a
portion
of
the
means
of
paying
the
rent
was
to
have
been
derived
,
and
a
slow
,
wasting
consumption
prevented
the
eldest
girl
from
continuing
her
exertions
.
 
<EOS>
Quarter
-
day
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlord
had
suffered
from
the
extravagance
of
his
last
tenant
,
and
he
had
no
compassion
for
the
struggles
of
his
successor
;
he
put
in
an
execution
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
passed
one
morning
,
the
broker
's
men
were
removing
the
little
furniture
there
was
in
the
house
,
and
a
newly
-
posted
bill
informed
us
it
was
again
"
To
Let
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
What
became
of
the
last
tenant
we
never
could
learn
;
we
believe
the
girl
is
past
all
suffering
,
and
beyond
all
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
her
!
 
<EOS>
We
hope
she
is
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
somewhat
curious
to
ascertain
what
would
be
the
next
stage
---
for
that
the
place
had
no
chance
of
succeeding
now
,
was
perfectly
clear
.
 
<EOS>
The
bill
was
soon
taken
down
,
and
some
alterations
were
being
made
in
the
interior
of
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
in
a
fever
of
expectation
;
we
exhausted
conjecture
---
we
imagined
all
possible
trades
,
none
of
which
were
perfectly
reconcilable
with
our
idea
of
the
gradual
decay
of
the
tenement
.
 
<EOS>
It
opened
,
and
we
wondered
why
we
had
not
guessed
at
the
real
state
of
the
case
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
shop
---
not
a
large
one
at
the
best
of
times
---
had
been
converted
into
two
:
 
<EOS>
one
was
a
bonnet
-
shape
maker
's
,
the
other
was
opened
by
a
tobacconist
,
who
also
dealt
in
walking
-
sticks
and
Sunday
newspapers
;
the
two
were
separated
by
a
thin
partition
,
covered
with
tawdry
striped
paper
.
   
<EOS>
The
tobacconist
remained
in
possession
longer
than
any
tenant
within
our
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
red
-
faced
,
impudent
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
dog
,
evidently
accustomed
to
take
things
as
they
came
,
and
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
.
 
<EOS>
He
sold
as
many
cigars
as
he
could
,
and
smoked
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
He
occupied
the
shop
as
long
as
he
could
make
peace
with
the
landlord
,
and
when
he
could
no
longer
live
in
quiet
,
he
very
coolly
locked
the
door
,
and
bolted
himself
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
period
,
the
two
little
dens
have
undergone
innumerable
changes
.
<EOS>
The
tobacconist
was
succeeded
by
a
theatrical
hair
-
dresser
,
who
ornamented
the
window
with
a
great
variety
of
"
characters
,
"
and
terrific
combats
.
 
<EOS>
The
bonnet
-
shape
maker
gave
place
to
a
greengrocer
,
and
the
histrionic
barber
was
succeeded
,
in
his
turn
,
by
a
tailor
.
 
<EOS>
So
numerous
have
been
the
changes
,
<EOS>
that
we
have
of
late
done
little
more
than
mark
<EOS>
the
peculiar
but
certain
indications
of
a
house
being
poorly
inhabited
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
progressing
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
.
 
<EOS>
The
occupiers
of
the
shops
have
gradually
given
up
room
after
room
,
until
they
have
only
reserved
the
little
parlour
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
First
there
appeared
a
brass
plate
on
the
private
door
,
with
"
Ladies
'
School
"
legibly
engraved
thereon
;
shortly
afterwards
we
observed
a
second
brass
plate
,
then
a
bell
,
and
then
another
bell
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
paused
in
front
of
our
old
friend
,
and
observed
these
signs
of
poverty
,
which
are
not
to
be
mistaken
,
we
thought
as
we
turned
away
,
that
the
house
had
attained
its
lowest
pitch
of
degradation
.
<EOS>
We
were
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
last
passed
it
,
a
"
dairy
"
was
established
in
the
area
,
and
a
party
of
melancholy
-
looking
fowls
were
amusing
themselves
by
running
in
at
the
front
door
,
and
out
at
the
back
one
.
   
<EOS>
Scotland
-
Yard
Scotland
-
yard
is
a
small
---
a
very
small
-
tract
of
land
,
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
river
Thames
,
on
the
other
by
the
gardens
of
Northumberland
House
:
 
abutting
at
one
end
on
the
bottom
of
Northumberland
-
street
,
at
the
other
on
the
back
of
Whitehall
-
place
.
<EOS>
When
this
territory
was
first
accidentally
discovered
by
a
country
gentleman
who
lost
his
way
in
the
Strand
,
some
years
ago
,
the
original
settlers
were
found
to
be
a
tailor
,
a
publican
,
two
eating
-
house
keepers
,
and
a
fruit
-
pie
maker
;
and
it
was
also
found
to
contain
a
race
of
strong
and
bulky
men
,
who
repaired
to
the
wharfs
in
Scotland
-
yard
regularly
every
morning
,
about
five
or
six
o'clock
,
to
fill
heavy
waggons
with
coal
,
with
which
they
proceeded
to
distant
places
up
the
country
,
and
supplied
the
inhabitants
with
fuel
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
emptied
their
waggons
,
they
again
returned
for
a
fresh
supply
;
and
this
trade
was
continued
throughout
the
year
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
settlers
derived
their
subsistence
from
ministering
to
the
wants
of
these
primitive
traders
,
the
articles
exposed
for
sale
,
and
the
places
where
they
were
sold
,
bore
strong
outward
marks
of
being
expressly
adapted
to
their
tastes
and
wishes
.
 
<EOS>
The
tailor
displayed
in
his
window
a
Lilliputian
pair
of
leather
gaiters
,
and
a
diminutive
round
frock
,
while
each
doorpost
was
appropriately
garnished
with
a
model
of
a
coal
-
sack
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
eating
-
house
keepers
exhibited
joints
of
a
magnitude
,
and
puddings
of
a
solidity
,
which
coalheavers
alone
could
appreciate
;
and
the
fruit
-
pie
maker
displayed
on
his
well
-
scrubbed
window
-
board
large
white
compositions
of
flour
and
dripping
,
ornamented
with
pink
stains
,
giving
rich
promise
of
the
fruit
within
,
which
made
their
huge
mouths
water
,
as
they
lingered
past
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
choicest
spot
in
all
Scotland
-
yard
was
the
old
public
-
house
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
in
a
dark
wainscoted
-
room
of
ancient
appearance
,
cheered
by
the
glow
of
a
mighty
fire
,
and
decorated
with
an
enormous
clock
,
whereof
the
face
was
white
,
and
the
figures
black
,
sat
the
lusty
coalheavers
,
quaffing
large
draughts
of
Barclay
's
best
,
and
puffing
forth
volumes
of
smoke
,
which
wreathed
heavily
above
their
heads
,
and
involved
the
room
in
a
thick
dark
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
apartment
might
their
voices
be
heard
on
a
winter
's
night
,
penetrating
to
the
very
bank
of
the
river
,
as
they
shouted
out
some
sturdy
chorus
,
or
roared
forth
the
burden
of
a
popular
song
;
dwelling
upon
the
last
few
words
with
a
strength
and
length
of
emphasis
which
made
the
very
roof
tremble
above
them
.
   
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
would
they
tell
old
legends
of
what
the
Thames
was
in
ancient
times
,
when
the
Patent
Shot
Manufactory
was
n't
built
,
and
Waterloo
-
bridge
had
never
been
thought
of
;
and
then
they
would
shake
their
heads
with
portentous
looks
,
to
the
deep
edification
of
the
rising
generation
of
heavers
,
who
crowded
round
them
,
and
wondered
where
all
this
would
end
;
whereat
the
tailor
would
take
his
pipe
solemnly
from
his
mouth
,
and
say
,
how
that
he
hoped
it
might
end
well
,
but
he
very
much
doubted
whether
it
would
or
not
,
and
could
n't
rightly
tell
what
to
make
of
it
---
a
mysterious
expression
of
opinion
,
delivered
with
a
semi
-
prophetic
air
,
which
never
failed
to
elicit
the
fullest
concurrence
of
the
assembled
company
;
and
so
they
would
go
on
drinking
and
wondering
till
ten
o'clock
came
,
and
with
it
the
tailor
's
wife
to
fetch
him
home
,
when
the
little
party
broke
up
,
to
meet
again
in
the
same
room
,
and
say
and
do
precisely
the
same
things
,
on
the
following
evening
at
the
same
hour
.
   
<EOS>
About
this
time
the
barges
that
came
up
the
river
began
to
bring
vague
rumours
to
Scotland
-
yard
of
somebody
in
the
city
having
been
heard
to
say
,
that
the
Lord
Mayor
had
threatened
in
so
many
words
to
pull
down
the
old
London
-
bridge
,
and
build
up
a
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
these
rumours
were
disregarded
as
idle
tales
,
wholly
destitute
of
foundation
,
for
nobody
in
Scotland
-
yard
doubted
that
if
the
Lord
Mayor
contemplated
any
such
dark
design
,
he
would
just
be
clapped
up
in
the
Tower
for
a
week
or
two
,
and
then
killed
off
for
high
treason
.
   
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
however
,
the
reports
grew
stronger
,
and
more
frequent
,
and
at
last
a
barge
,
laden
with
numerous
chaldrons
of
the
best
Wallsend
,
brought
up
the
positive
intelligence
that
several
of
the
arches
of
the
old
bridge
were
stopped
,
and
that
preparations
were
actually
in
progress
for
constructing
the
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
What
an
excitement
was
visible
in
the
old
tap
-
room
on
that
memorable
night
!
<EOS>
Each
man
looked
into
his
neighbour
's
face
,
pale
with
alarm
and
astonishment
,
and
read
therein
an
echo
of
the
sentiments
which
filled
his
own
breast
.
 
<EOS>
The
oldest
heaver
present
proved
to
demonstration
,
that
the
moment
the
piers
were
removed
,
all
the
water
in
the
Thames
would
run
clean
off
,
and
leave
a
dry
gully
in
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
to
become
of
the
coal
-
barges
---
of
the
trade
of
Scotland
-
yard
---
of
the
very
existence
of
its
population
?
 
<EOS>
The
tailor
shook
his
head
more
sagely
than
usual
,
and
grimly
pointing
to
a
knife
on
the
table
,
bid
them
wait
and
see
what
happened
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
---
not
he
;
but
if
the
Lord
Mayor
did
n't
fall
a
victim
to
popular
indignation
,
why
he
would
be
rather
astonished
;
that
was
all
.
   
<EOS>
They
did
wait
;
barge
after
barge
arrived
,
and
still
no
tidings
of
the
assassination
of
the
Lord
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
stone
was
laid
:
 
it
was
done
by
a
Duke
---
the
King
's
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Years
passed
away
,
and
the
bridge
was
opened
by
the
King
himself
.
 
<EOS>
In
course
of
time
,
the
piers
were
removed
;
and
when
the
people
in
Scotland
-
yard
got
up
next
morning
in
the
confident
expectation
of
being
able
to
step
over
to
Pedlar
's
Acre
without
wetting
the
soles
of
their
shoes
,
they
found
to
their
unspeakable
astonishment
that
the
water
was
just
where
it
used
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
A
result
so
different
from
that
which
they
had
anticipated
from
this
first
improvement
,
produced
its
full
effect
upon
the
inhabitants
of
Scotland
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
eating
-
house
keepers
began
to
court
public
opinion
,
and
to
look
for
customers
among
a
new
class
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
He
covered
his
little
dining
-
tables
with
white
cloths
,
and
got
a
painter
's
apprentice
to
inscribe
something
about
hot
joints
from
twelve
to
two
,
in
one
of
the
little
panes
of
his
shop
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
Improvement
began
to
march
with
rapid
strides
to
the
very
threshold
of
Scotland
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
A
new
market
sprung
up
at
Hungerford
,
and
the
Police
Commissioners
established
their
office
in
Whitehall
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
traffic
in
Scotland
-
yard
increased
;
fresh
Members
were
added
to
the
House
of
Commons
<EOS>
,
the
Metropolitan
Representatives
found
it
a
near
cut
,
and
many
other
foot
passengers
followed
their
example
.
   
<EOS>
We
marked
the
advance
of
civilisation
,
and
beheld
it
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
The
eating
-
house
keeper
who
manfully
resisted
the
innovation
of
table
-
cloths
,
was
losing
ground
every
day
,
as
his
opponent
gained
it
,
and
a
deadly
feud
sprung
up
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
genteel
one
no
longer
took
his
evening
's
pint
in
Scotland
-
yard
,
but
drank
gin
and
water
at
a
"
parlour
"
in
Parliament
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
fruit
-
pie
maker
still
continued
to
visit
the
old
room
,
but
he
took
to
smoking
cigars
,
and
began
to
call
himself
a
pastrycook
,
and
to
read
the
papers
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
heavers
still
assembled
round
the
ancient
fireplace
,
but
their
talk
was
mournful
:
 
and
the
loud
song
and
the
joyous
shout
were
heard
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
And
what
is
Scotland
-
yard
now
?
 
<EOS>
How
have
its
old
customs
changed
;
and
how
has
the
ancient
simplicity
of
its
inhabitants
faded
away
!
<EOS>
The
old
tottering
public
-
house
is
converted
into
a
spacious
and
lofty
"
wine
-
vaults
;
"
gold
leaf
has
been
used
in
the
construction
of
the
letters
which
emblazon
its
exterior
,
and
the
poet
's
art
has
been
called
into
requisition
,
to
intimate
that
if
you
drink
a
certain
description
of
ale
,
you
must
hold
fast
by
the
rail
.
 
<EOS>
The
tailor
exhibits
in
his
window
the
pattern
of
a
foreign
-
looking
brown
surtout
,
with
silk
buttons
,
a
fur
collar
,
and
fur
cuffs
.
 
<EOS>
He
wears
a
stripe
down
the
outside
of
each
leg
of
his
trousers
:
 
and
we
have
detected
his
assistants
(
for
he
has
assistants
now
)
in
the
act
of
sitting
on
the
shop
-
board
in
the
same
uniform
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
other
end
of
the
little
row
of
houses
<EOS>
a
boot
-
maker
has
established
himself
in
a
brick
box
,
with
the
additional
innovation
of
a
first
floor
;
and
here
he
exposes
for
sale
,
boots
---
<EOS>
real
Wellington
boots
---
an
article
which
a
few
years
ago
,
none
of
the
original
inhabitants
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
<EOS>
but
the
other
day
,
that
a
dress
-
maker
opened
another
little
box
in
the
middle
of
the
row
;
and
,
when
we
thought
that
the
spirit
of
change
could
produce
no
alteration
beyond
that
,
a
jeweller
appeared
,
and
not
content
with
exposing
gilt
rings
and
copper
bracelets
out
of
number
,
put
up
an
announcement
,
which
still

The
dress

maker
employs
a
young
lady
who
wears
pockets
in
her
apron
;
and
the
tailor
informs
the
public
that
gentlemen
may
have
their
own

made
up

<EOS>
Amidst
all
this
change
,
and
restlessness
,
and
innovation
,
there
remains
but
one
old
man
,
who
seems
to
mourn
the
downfall
of
this
ancient
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
holds
no
converse
with
human
kind
,
but
,
seated
on
a
wooden
bench
at
the
angle
of
the
wall
which
fronts
the
crossing
from
Whitehall
-
place
,
watches
in
silence
the
gambols
of
his
sleek
and
well
-
fed
dogs
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
presiding
genius
of
Scotland
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
Years
and
years
have
rolled
over
his
head
;
but
,
in
fine
weather
or
in
foul
,
hot
or
cold
,
wet
or
dry
,
hail
,
rain
,
or
snow
,
he
is
still
in
his
accustomed
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Misery
and
want
are
depicted
in
his
countenance
;
his
form
is
bent
by
age
,
his
head
is
grey
with
length
of
trial
,
but
there
he
sits
from
day
to
day
,
brooding
over
the
past
;
and
thither
he
will
continue
to
drag
his
feeble
limbs
,
until
his
eyes
have
closed
upon
Scotland
-
yard
,
and
upon
the
world
together
.
   
<EOS>
A
few
years
hence
,
and
the
antiquary
of
another
generation
looking
into
some
mouldy
record
of
the
strife
and
passions
that
agitated
the
world
in
these
times
,
may
glance
his
eye
over
the
pages
we
have
just
filled
:
 
and
not
all
his
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
past
,
not
all
his
black
-
letter
lore
,
or
his
skill
in
book
-
collecting
,
not
all
the
dry
studies
of
a
long
life
,
or
the
dusty
volumes
that
have
cost
him
a
fortune
,
may
help
him
to
the
whereabouts
,
either
of
Scotland

yard
,
or
of
any
one
of
the
landmarks
we

Seven
Dials
<EOS>
We
have
always
been
of
opinion
that
if
Tom
King
and
the
Frenchman
had
not
immortalised
Seven
Dials
,
Seven
Dials
would
have
immortalised
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Seven
Dials
!
<EOS>
the
region
of
song
and
poetry
---
first
effusions
,
and
last
dying
speeches
:
 
hallowed
by
the
names
of
Catnach
and
of
Pitts
---
names
that
will
entwine
themselves
with
costermongers
,
and
barrel

organs
,
when
penny
magazines
shall
have
superseded
penny
yards
of

<EOS>
Look
at
the
construction
of
the
place

<EOS>
The
Gordian
knot
was
all
very
well
in
its
way
:
 
<EOS>
so
was
the
maze
of
Hampton
Court
:
 
<EOS>
so
is
the
maze
at
the
Beulah
Spa
:
 
<EOS>
so
were
the
ties
of
stiff
white
neckcloths
,
when
the
difficulty
of
getting
one
on
,
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
apparent
impossibility
of
ever
getting
it
off
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
involutions
can
compare
with
those
of
Seven
Dials
?
<EOS>
Where
is
there
such
another
maze
of
streets
,
courts
,
lanes
,
and
alleys
?
 
<EOS>
Where
such
a
pure
mixture
of
Englishmen
and
Irishmen
,
as
in
this
complicated
part
of
London
?
 
<EOS>
We
boldly
aver
that
we
doubt
the
veracity
of
the
legend
to
which
we
have
adverted
.
 
<EOS>
We
CAN
suppose
a
man
rash
enough
to
inquire
at
random
---
at
a
house
with
lodgers
too
---
for
a
Mr
Thompson
,
with
all
but
the
certainty
before
his
eyes
,
of
finding
at
least
two
or
three
Thompsons
in
any
house
of
moderate
dimensions
;
but
a
Frenchman
---
a
Frenchman
in
Seven
Dials
!
 
<EOS>
Pooh
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
Irishman
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
King
's
education
had
been
neglected
in
his
infancy
,
and
as
he
could
n't
understand
half
the
man
said
,
he
took
it
for
granted
he
was
talking
French
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
who
finds
himself
in
"
The

"
for

,
and
stands
Belzoni

like
,
at
the
entrance
of
seven
obscure
passages
,
uncertain
which
to
take
,
will
see
enough
around
him
to
keep
his
curiosity
and
attention
awake
for
no

From
the
irregular
square
into
which
he
has
plunged
,
the
streets
and
courts
dart
in
all
directions
,
until
they
are
lost
in
the
unwholesome
vapour
which
hangs
over
the
house

tops
,
and
renders
the
dirty
perspective
uncertain
and
confined
;
and
lounging
at
every
corner
,
as
if
they
came
there
to
take
a
few
gasps
of
such
fresh
air
as
has
found
its
way
so
far
,

is
too
much
exhausted
already
,
to
be
enabled

force
itself

the
narrow

<EOS>
a

Londoner
's
with
astonishment

<EOS>
On
one
side
,
a
little
crowd
has
collected
round
a
couple
of
ladies
,
who
having
imbibed
the
contents
of
various
"
three

outs
"
of
gin
and
bitters
in
the
course
of
the
morning
,
have
at
length
differed
on
some
point
of
domestic
arrangement
,
and
are
on
the
eve
of
settling
the
quarrel
satisfactorily
,
by
an
appeal
to
blows
,
greatly
to
the
interest
of
other

who
live
in

This
somewhat

not

to
the

intemperance

also
to

squabbling
in

every

It

odd

The
peculiar
character
of
these
streets

and
the
close
resemblance
each

bears
to

by

tends

streets

Here

a

hung
up

announce
the
entrance

betray
the

some
young

in
whom
a
passion
for
shop
tills
has
developed
itself
at
an
early
age
:
 
others
,
as
if
for
support
,
against
some
handsome
lofty
building
,
which
usurps
the
place
of
a
low
dingy
public

house
;
long
rows
of
broken
and
patched
windows
expose
plants
that

flourished
when
"

themselves

cleanliness
with
the
bird

fanciers

rabbit

which
one
might
fancy
so
many

for
the
irresistible
conviction
that
no
bird

its

Every

most

generally
the

The

live

The

leads
a

his

him

he
writes
poems

Mr

Now
anybody
who
passed
through

a
hot
summer

evening

saw
the
different

gossiping

would

all

harmony

attachment
towards
Monmouth
-
street
,
as
the
only
true
and
real
emporium
for
second
-
hand
wearing
apparel
.
 
<EOS>
Monmouth
-
street
is
venerable
from
its
antiquity
,
and
respectable
from
its
usefulness
.
 
<EOS>
Holywell
-
street
we
despise
;
the
red
-
headed
and
red
-
whiskered
Jews
who
forcibly
haul
you
into
their
squalid
houses
,
and
thrust
you
into
a
suit
of
clothes
,
whether
you
will
or
not
,
we
detest
.
   
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
Monmouth
-
street
are
a
distinct
class
;
a
peaceable
and
retiring
race
,
who
immure
themselves
for
the
most
part
in
deep
cellars
,
or
small
back
parlours
,
and
who
seldom
come
forth
into
the
world
,
except
in
the
dusk
and
coolness
of
the
evening
,
when
they
may
be
seen
seated
,
in
chairs
on
the
pavement
,
smoking
their
pipes
,
or
watching
the
gambols
of
their
engaging
children
as
they
revel
in
the
gutter
,
a
happy
troop
of
infantine
scavengers
.
 
<EOS>
Their
countenances
bear
a
thoughtful
and
a
dirty
cast
,
certain
indications
of
their
love
of
traffic
;
and
their
habitations
are
distinguished
by
that
disregard
of
outward
appearance
and
neglect
of
personal
comfort
,
so
common
among
people
who
are
constantly
immersed
in
profound
speculations
,
and
deeply
engaged
in
sedentary
pursuits
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
hinted
at
the
antiquity
of
our
favourite
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
Monmouth
-
street
laced
coat
"
was
a
by
-
word
a
century
ago
;
and
still
we
find
Monmouth
-
street
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Pilot
great
-
coats
with
wooden
buttons
,
have
usurped
the
place
of
the
ponderous
laced
coats
with
full
skirts
;
embroidered
waistcoats
with
large
flaps
,
have
yielded
to
double
-
breasted
checks
with
roll
-
collars
;
and
three
-
cornered
hats
of
quaint
appearance
,
have
given
place
to
the
low
crowns
and
broad
brims
of
the
coachman
school
;
but
it
is
the
times
that
have
changed
,
not
Monmouth
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
Through
every
alteration
and
every
change
,
Monmouth
-
street
has
still
remained
the
burial
-
place
of
the
fashions
;
and
such
,
to
judge
from
all
present
appearances
,
it
will
remain
until
there
are
no
more
fashions
to
bury
.
   
<EOS>
We
love
to
walk
among
these
extensive
groves
of
the
illustrious
dead
,
and
to
indulge
in
the
speculations
to
which
they
give
rise
;
now
fitting
a
deceased
coat
,
then
a
dead
pair
of
trousers
,
and
anon
the
mortal
remains
of
a
gaudy
waistcoat
,
upon
some
being
of
our
own
conjuring
up
,
and
endeavouring
,
from
the
shape
and
fashion
of
the
garment
itself
,
to
bring
its
former
owner
before
our
mind
's
eye
.
<EOS>
We
have
gone
on
speculating
in
this
way
,
until
whole
rows
of
coats
have
started
from
their
pegs
,
and
buttoned
up
,
of
their
own
accord
,
round
the
waists
of
imaginary
wearers
;
lines
of
trousers
have
jumped
down
to
meet
them
;
waistcoats
have
almost
burst
with
anxiety
to
put
themselves
on
;
and
half
an
acre
of
shoes
have
suddenly
found
feet
to
fit
them
,
and
gone
stumping
down
the
street
with
a
noise
which
has
fairly
awakened
us
from
our
pleasant
reverie
,
and
driven
us
slowly
away
,
with
a
bewildered
stare
,
an
object
of
astonishment
to
the
good
people
of
Monmouth
-
street
,
and
of
no
slight
suspicion
to
the
policemen
at
the
opposite
street
corner
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
occupied
in
this
manner
the
other
day
,
endeavouring
to
fit
a
pair
of
lace
-
up
<EOS>
half
-
boots
on
an
ideal
personage
,
<EOS>
for
whom
,
to
say
the
truth
,
they
were
full
a
couple
of
sizes
too
small
,
when
our
eyes
happened
to
alight
on
a
few
suits
of
clothes
ranged
outside
a
shop
-
window
,
which
it
immediately
struck
us
,
must
at
different
periods
have
all
belonged
to
,
and
been
worn
by
,
the
same
individual
,
and
had
now
,
by
one
of
those
strange
conjunctions
of
circumstances
which
will
occur
sometimes
,
come
to
be
exposed
together
for
sale
in
the
same
shop
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
seemed
a
fantastic
one
,
and
we
looked
at
the
clothes
again
with
a
firm
determination
not
to
be
easily
led
away
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
we
were
right
;
the
more
we
looked
,
the
more
we
were
convinced
of
the
accuracy
of
our
previous
impression
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
man
's
whole
life
written
as
legibly
on
those
clothes
,
as
if
we
had
his
autobiography
engrossed
on
parchment
before
us
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
was
a
patched
and
much
-
soiled
skeleton
suit
;
one
of
those
straight
blue
cloth
cases
in
which
small
boys
used
to
be
confined
,
before
belts
and
tunics
had
come
in
,
and
old
notions
had
gone
out
:
an
ingenious
contrivance
for
displaying
the
full
symmetry
of
a
boy
's
figure
,
by
fastening
him
into
a
very
tight
jacket
,
with
an
ornamental
row
of
buttons
over
each
shoulder
,
and
then
buttoning
his
trousers
over
it
,
so
as
to
give
his
legs
the
appearance
of
being
hooked
on
,
just
under
the
armpits
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
boy
's
dress
.
<EOS>
It
had
belonged
to
a
town
boy
,
we
could
see
;
there
was
a
shortness
about
the
legs
and
arms
of
the
suit
;
and
a
bagging
at
the
knees
,
peculiar
to
the
rising
youth
of
London
streets
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
day
-
school
he
had
been
at
,
evidently
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
a
regular
boys
'
school
they
would
n't
have
let
him
play
on
the
floor
so
much
,
and
rub
his
knees
so
white
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
an
indulgent
mother
too
,
and
plenty
of
halfpence
,
as
the
numerous
smears
of
some
sticky
substance
about
the
pockets
,
and
just
below
the
chin
,
which
even
the
salesman
's
skill
could
not
succeed
in
disguising
,
sufficiently
betokened
.
<EOS>
They
were
decent
people
,
but
not
overburdened
with
riches
,
or
he
would
not
have
so
far
outgrown
the
suit
when
he
passed
into
those
corduroys
with
the
round
jacket
;
in
which
he
went
to
a
boys
'
school
,
however
,
and
learnt
to
write
---
and
in
ink
of
pretty
tolerable
blackness
,
too
,
if
the
place
where
he
used
to
wipe
his
pen
might
be
taken
as
evidence
.
   
<EOS>
A
black
suit
and
the
jacket
changed
into
a
diminutive
coat
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
had
died
,
and
the
mother
had
got
the
boy
a
message
-
lad
's
place
in
some
office
.
 
<EOS>
A
long
-
worn
suit
that
one
;
rusty
and
threadbare
before
it
was
laid
aside
,
but
clean
and
free
from
soil
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
woman
!
 
<EOS>
We
could
imagine
her
assumed
cheerfulness
over
the
scanty
meal
,
and
the
refusal
of
her
own
small
portion
,
that
her
hungry
boy
might
have
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Her
constant
anxiety
for
his
welfare
,
her
pride
in
his
growth
mingled
sometimes
with
the
thought
,
almost
too
acute
to
bear
,
that
as
he
grew
to
be
a
man
his
old
affection
might
cool
,
old
kindnesses
fade
from
his
mind
,
and
old
promises
be
forgotten
---
the
sharp
pain
that
even
then
a
careless
word
or
a
cold
look
would
give
her
---
all
crowded
on
our
thoughts
as
vividly
as
if
the
very
scene
were
passing
before
us
.
   
<EOS>
These
things
happen
every
hour
,
and
we
all
know
it
;
and
yet
we
felt
as
much
sorrow
when
we
saw
,
or
fancied
we
saw
<EOS>
---
it
makes
no
difference
which
---
the
change
that
began
to
take
place
now
,
as
if
we
had
just
conceived
the
bare
possibility
of
such
a
thing
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
suit
,
smart
but
slovenly
;
meant
to
be
gay
,
and
yet
not
half
so
decent
as
the
threadbare
apparel
;
<EOS>
redolent
of
the
idle
lounge
,
and
the
blackguard
companions
,
told
us
,
we
thought
,
that
the
widow
's
comfort
had
rapidly
faded
away
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
imagine
that
coat
---
imagine
!
<EOS>
we
could
see
it
;
we
HAD
seen
it
a
hundred
times
---
sauntering
in
company
with
three
or
four
other
coats
of
the
same
cut
,
about
some
place
of
profligate
resort
at
night
.
   
<EOS>
We
dressed
,
from
the
same
shop
-
window
in
an
instant
,
half
a
dozen
boys
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
;
and
putting
cigars
into
their
mouths
,
and
their
hands
into
their
pockets
,
watched
them
as
they
sauntered
down
the
street
,
and
lingered
at
the
corner
,
with
the
obscene
jest
,
and
the
oft
-
repeated
oath
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
lost
sight
of
them
,
till
they
had
cocked
their
hats
a
little
more
on
one
side
,
and
swaggered
into
the
public
-
house
;
and
then
we
entered
the
desolate
home
,
where
the
mother
sat
late
in
the
night
,
alone
;
we
watched
her
,
as
she
paced
the
room
in
feverish
anxiety
,
and
every
now
and
then
opened
the
door
,
looked
wistfully
into
the
dark
and
empty
street
,
and
again
returned
,
to
be
again
and
again
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
We
beheld
the
look
of
patience
with
which
she
bore
the
brutish
threat
,
nay
,
even
the
drunken
blow
;
and
we
heard
the
agony
of
tears
that
gushed
from
her
very
heart
,
as
she
sank
upon
her
knees
in
her
solitary
and
wretched
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
A
long
period
had
elapsed
,
and
a
greater
change
had
taken
place
,
by
the
time
of
casting
off
the
suit
that
hung
above
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
a
stout
,
broad
-
shouldered
,
sturdy
-
chested
man
;
and
we
knew
at
once
,
as
anybody
would
,
who
glanced
at
that
broad
-
skirted
green
coat
,
with
the
large
metal
buttons
,
that
its
wearer
seldom
walked
forth
without
a
dog
at
his
heels
,
and
some
idle
ruffian
,
the
very
counterpart
of
himself
,
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
The
vices
of
the
boy
had
grown
with
the
man
,
and
we
fancied
his
home
then
---
if
such
a
place
deserve
the
name
.
   
<EOS>
We
saw
the
bare
and
miserable
room
,
destitute
of
furniture
,
crowded
with
his
wife
and
children
,
pale
,
hungry
,
and
emaciated
;
the
man
cursing
their
lamentations
,
staggering
to
the
tap
-
room
,
from
whence
he
had
just
returned
,
followed
by
his
wife
and
a
sickly
infant
,
clamouring
for
bread
;
and
heard
the
street
-
wrangle
and
noisy
recrimination
that
his
striking
her
occasioned
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
imagination
led
us
to
some
metropolitan
workhouse
,
situated
in
the
midst
of
crowded
streets
and
alleys
,
filled
with
noxious
vapours
,
and
ringing
with
boisterous
cries
,
where
an
old
and
feeble
woman
,
imploring
pardon
for
her
son
,
lay
dying
in
a
close
dark
room
,
with
no
child
to
clasp
her
hand
,
and
no
pure
air
from
heaven
to
fan
her
brow
.
 
<EOS>
A
stranger
closed
the
eyes
that
settled
into
a
cold
unmeaning
glare
,
and
strange
ears
received
the
words
that
murmured
from
the
white
and
half
-
closed
lips
.
   
<EOS>
A
coarse
round
frock
,
with
a
worn
cotton
neckerchief
,
and
other
articles
of
clothing
of
the
commonest
description
,
completed
the
history
.
 
<EOS>
A
prison
,
and
the
sentence
---
banishment
or
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
What
would
the
man
have
given
then
,
to
be
once
again
the
contented
humble
drudge
of
his
boyish
years
;
to
have
been
restored
to
life
,
but
for
a
week
,
a
day
,
an
hour
,
a
minute
,
only
for
so
long
a
time
as
would
enable
him
to
say
one
word
of
passionate
regret
to
,
and
hear
one
sound
of
heartfelt
forgiveness
from
,
the
cold
and
ghastly
form
that
lay
rotting
in
the
pauper
's
grave
!
 
<EOS>
The
children
wild
in
the
streets
,
the
mother
a
destitute
widow
;
both
deeply
tainted
with
the
deep
disgrace
of
the
husband
and
father
's
name
,
and
impelled
by
sheer
necessity
,
down
the
precipice
that
had
led
him
to
a
lingering
death
,
possibly
of
many
years
'
duration
,
thousands
of
miles
away
.
<EOS>
We
had
no
clue
to
the
end
of
the
tale
;
but
it
was
easy
to
guess
its
termination
.
   
<EOS>
We
took
a
step
or
two
further
on
,
and
by
way
of
restoring
the
naturally
cheerful
tone
of
our
thoughts
,
began
fitting
visionary
feet
and
legs
into
a
cellar
-
board
full
of
boots
and
shoes
,
with
a
speed
and
accuracy
that
would
have
astonished
the
most
expert
artist
in
leather
,
living
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
pair
of
boots
in
particular
---
a
jolly
,
good
-
tempered
,
hearty
-
looking
pair
of
tops
,
that
excited
our
warmest
regard
;
and
we
had
got
a
fine
,
red
-
faced
,
jovial
fellow
of
a
market
-
gardener
into
them
,
before
we
had
made
their
acquaintance
half
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
just
the
very
thing
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
his
huge
fat
legs
bulging
over
the
tops
,
and
fitting
them
too
tight
to
admit
of
his
tucking
in
the
loops
he
had
pulled
them
on
by
;
and
his
knee
-
cords
with
an
interval
of
stocking
;
and
his
blue
apron
tucked
up
round
his
waist
;
and
his
red
neckerchief
and
blue
coat
,
and
a
white
hat
stuck
on
one
side
of
his
head
;
and
there
he
stood
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
great
red
face
,
whistling
away
,
as
if
any
other
idea
but
that
of
being
happy
and
comfortable
had
never
entered
his
brain
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
very
man
after
our
own
heart
;
we
knew
all
about
him
;
we
had
seen
him
coming
up
to
Covent
-
garden
in
his
green
chaise
-
cart
,
with
the
fat
,
tubby
little
horse
,
half
a
thousand
times
;
and
even
while
we
cast
an
affectionate
look
upon
his
boots
,
at
that
instant
,
<EOS>
the
form
of
a
coquettish
servant
-
maid
suddenly
sprung
into
a
pair
of
Denmark
satin
shoes
that
stood
beside
them
,
and
we
at
once
recognised
the
very
girl
who
accepted
his
offer
of
a
ride
,
just
on
this
side
<EOS>
the
Hammersmith
suspension
-
bridge
,
the
very
last
Tuesday
morning
we
rode
into
town
from
Richmond
.
   
<EOS>
A
very
smart
female
,
in
a
showy
bonnet
,
stepped
into
a
pair
of
grey
cloth
boots
,
with
black
fringe
and
binding
,
that
were
studiously
pointing
out
their
toes
on
the
other
side
of
the
top
-
boots
,
and
seemed
very
anxious
to
engage
his
attention
,
but
we
did
n't
observe
that
our
friend
the
market
-
gardener
appeared
at
all
captivated
with
these
blandishments
;
for
beyond
giving
a
knowing
wink
when
they
first
began
,
as
if
to
imply
that
he
quite
understood
their
end
and
object
,
he
took
no
further
notice
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
indifference
,
however
,
was
amply
recompensed
by
the
excessive
gallantry
of
a
very
old
gentleman
with
a
silver
-
headed
stick
,
who
tottered
into
a
pair
of
large
list
shoes
,
that
were
standing
in
one
corner
of
the
board
,
and
indulged
in
a
variety
of
gestures
expressive
of
his
admiration
of
the
lady
in
the
cloth
boots
,
to
the
immeasurable
amusement
of
a
young
fellow
we
put
into
a
pair
of
long
-
quartered
pumps
,
who
we
thought
would
have
split
the
coat
that
slid
down
to
meet
him
,
with
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
been
looking
on
at
this
little
pantomime
with
great
satisfaction
for
some
time
,
when
,
to
our
unspeakable
astonishment
,
we
perceived
that
the
whole
of
the
characters
,
including
a
numerous
CORPS
DE
BALLET
of
boots
and
shoes
in
the
background
,
into
which
we
had
been
hastily
thrusting
as
many
feet
as
we
could
press
into
the
service
,
were
arranging
themselves
in
order
for
dancing
;
and
some
music
striking
up
at
the
moment
,
to
it
<EOS>
they
went
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
delightful
to
witness
the
agility
of
the
market
-
gardener
.
 
<EOS>
Out
went
the
boots
,
first
on
one
side
,
then
on
the
other
,
then
cutting
,
then
shuffling
,
then
setting
to
the
Denmark
satins
,
then
advancing
,
then
retreating
,
then
going
round
,
and
then
repeating
the
whole
of
the
evolutions
again
,
without
appearing
to
suffer
in
the
least
from
the
violence
of
the
exercise
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
Denmark
satins
a
bit
behindhand
,
for
they
jumped
and
bounded
about
,
in
all
directions
;
and
though
they
were
neither
so
regular
,
nor
so
true
to
the
time
as
the
cloth
boots
,
still
,
as
they
seemed
to
do
it
from
the
heart
,
and
to
enjoy
it
more
,
we
candidly
confess
that
we
preferred
their
style
of
dancing
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
old
gentleman
in
the
list
shoes
was
the
most
amusing
object
in
the
whole
party
;
<EOS>
for
,
besides
his
grotesque
attempts
to
appear
youthful
,
and
amorous
,
which
were
sufficiently
entertaining
in
themselves
,
the
young
fellow
in
the
pumps
managed
so
artfully
that
every
time
the
old
gentleman
advanced
to
salute
the
lady
in
the
cloth
boots
,
he
trod
with
his
whole
weight
on
the
old
fellow
's
toes
,
which
made
him
roar
with
anguish
,
and
rendered
all
the
others
like
to
die
of
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
these
festivities
when
we
heard
a
shrill
,
and
by
no
means
musical
voice
,
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
Hope
you
'll
know
me
agin
,
imperence
!
"
<EOS>
and
on
looking
intently
forward
to
see
from
whence
the
sound
came
,
we
found
that
it
proceeded
,
not
from
the
young
lady
in
the
cloth
boots
,
as
we
had
at
first
been
inclined
to
suppose
,
but
from
a
bulky
lady
of
elderly
appearance
who
was
seated
in
a
chair
at
the
head
of
the
cellar
-
steps
,
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
superintending
the
sale
of
the
articles
arranged
there
.
   
<EOS>
A
barrel
-
organ
,
which
had
been
in
full
force
close
behind
us
,
ceased
playing
;
the
people
we
had
been
fitting
into
the
shoes
and
boots
took
to
flight
at
the
interruption
;
and
as
we
were
conscious
that
in
the
depth
of
our
meditations
we
might
have
been
rudely
staring
at
the
old
lady
for
half
an
hour
without
knowing
it
,
we
took
to
flight
too
,
and
were
soon
immersed
in
the
deepest
obscurity
of
the
adjacent
"
Dials

Hackney
-
coach
stands
We
maintain
that
hackney
-
coaches
,
properly
so
called
,
belong
solely
to
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
be
told
,
that
there
are
hackney
-
coach
stands
in
Edinburgh
;
and
not
to
go
quite
so
far
for
a
contradiction
to
our
position
,
we
may
be
reminded
that
Liverpool
,
Manchester
,
"
and
other
large
towns
"
(
as
the
Parliamentary
phrase
goes
)
,
have
THEIR
hackney
-
coach
stands
.
 
<EOS>
We
readily
concede
to
these
places
the
possession
of
certain
vehicles
,
which
may
look
almost
as
dirty
,
and
even
go
almost
as
slowly
,
as
London
hackney
-
coaches
;
but
that
they
have
the
slightest
claim
to
compete
with
the
metropolis
,
either
in
point
of
stands
,
drivers
,
or
cattle
,
we
indignantly
deny
.
   
<EOS>
Take
a
regular
,
ponderous
,
rickety
,
London
hackney
-
coach
of
the
old
school
,
and
let
any
man
have
the
boldness
to
assert
,
if
he
can
,
that
he
ever
beheld
any
object
on
the
face
of
the
earth
which
at
all
resembles
it
,
unless
,
indeed
,
it
were
another
hackney
-
coach
of
the
same
date
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
recently
observed
on
certain
stands
,
and
we
say
it
with
deep
regret
,
rather
dapper
green
chariots
,
and
coaches
of
polished
yellow
,
with
four
wheels
of
the
same
colour
as
the
coach
,
whereas
it
is
perfectly
notorious
to
every
one
who
has
studied
the
subject
,
that
every
wheel
ought
to
be
of
a
different
colour
,
and
a
different
size
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
innovations
,
and
,
like
other
miscalled
improvements
,
awful
signs
of
the
restlessness
of
the
public
mind
,
and
the
little
respect
paid
to
our
time
-
honoured
institutions
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
hackney
-
coaches
be
clean
?
 
<EOS>
Our
ancestors
found
them
dirty
,
and
left
them
so
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
we
,
with
a
feverish
wish
to
"
keep
moving
,
"
desire
to
roll
along
at
the
rate
of
six
miles
an
hour
,
while
they
were
content
to
rumble
over
the
stones
at
four
?
 
<EOS>
These
are
solemn
considerations
.
 
<EOS>
Hackney
-
coaches
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
law
of
the
land
;
they
were
settled
by
the
Legislature
;
plated
and
numbered
by
the
wisdom
of
Parliament
.
   
<EOS>
Then
why
have
they
been
swamped
by
cabs
and
omnibuses
?
 
<EOS>
Or
why
should
people
be
allowed
to
ride
quickly
for
eightpence
a
mile
,
after
Parliament
had
come
to
the
solemn
decision
that
they
should
pay
a
shilling
a
mile
for
riding
slowly
?
 
<EOS>
We
pause
for
a
reply
;
---
and
,
having
no
chance
of
getting
one
,
begin
a
fresh
paragraph
.
   
<EOS>
Our
acquaintance
with
hackney
-
coach
stands
is
of
long
standing
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
a
walking
book
of
fares
,
feeling
ourselves
,
half
bound
,
as
it
were
,
to
be
always
in
the
right
on
contested
points
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
all
the
regular
watermen
within
three
miles
of
Covent
-
garden
by
sight
,
and
should
be
almost
tempted
to
believe
that
all
the
hackney
-
coach
horses
in
that
district
knew
us
by
sight
too
,
if
one
-
half
of
them
were
not
blind
.
 
<EOS>
We
take
great
interest
in
hackney
-
coaches
,
but
we
seldom
drive
,
having
a
knack
of
turning
ourselves
over
when
we
attempt
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
as
great
friends
to
horses
,
hackney
-
coach
and
otherwise
,
as
the
renowned
Mr
Martin
,
of
costermonger
notoriety
,
<EOS>
and
yet
we
never
ride
.
 
<EOS>
We
keep
no
horse
,
but
a
clothes
-
horse
;
enjoy
no
saddle
so
much
as
a
saddle
of
mutton
;
and
,
following
our
own
inclinations
,
have
never
followed
the
hounds
.
<EOS>
Leaving
these
fleeter
means
of
getting
over
the
ground
,
or
of
depositing
oneself
upon
it
,
to
those
who
like
them
,
by
hackney
-
coach
stands
we
take
our
stand
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
a
hackney
-
coach
stand
under
the
very
window
at
which
we
are
writing
;
there
is
only
one
coach
on
it
now
,
but
it
is
a
fair
specimen
of
the
class
of
vehicles
to
which
we
have
alluded
---
a
great
,
lumbering
,
square
concern
of
a
dingy
yellow
colour
(
like
a
bilious
brunette
)
,
with
very
small
glasses
,
but
very
large
frames
;
the
panels
are
ornamented
with
a
faded
coat
of
arms
,
in
shape
something
like
a
dissected
bat
,
the
axletree
is
red
,
and
the
majority
of
the
wheels
are
green
.
 
<EOS>
The
box
is
partially
covered
by
an
old
great
-
coat
,
with
a
multiplicity
of
capes
,
and
some
extraordinary
-
looking
clothes
;
and
the
straw
,
with
which
the
canvas
cushion
is
stuffed
,
is
sticking
up
in
several
places
,
as
if
in
rivalry
of
the
hay
,
which
is
peeping
through
the
chinks
in
the
boot
.
 
<EOS>
The
horses
,
with
drooping
heads
,
and
each
with
a
mane
and
tail
as
scanty
and
straggling
as
those
of
a
worn
-
out
rocking
-
horse
,
are
standing
patiently
on
some
damp
straw
,
occasionally
wincing
,
and
rattling
the
harness
;
and
now
and
then
,
one
of
them
lifts
his
mouth
to
the
ear
of
his
companion
,
as
if
he
were
saying
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
he
should
like
to
assassinate
the
coachman
.
 
<EOS>
The
coachman
himself
is
in
the
watering
-
house
;
and
the
waterman
,
with
his
hands
forced
into
his
pockets
as
far
as
they
can
possibly
go
,
is
dancing
the
"
double
shuffle
,
"
in
front
of
the
pump
,
to
keep
his
feet
warm
.
   
<EOS>
The
servant
-
girl
,
with
the
pink
ribbons
,
at
No
.
5
,
opposite
,
suddenly
opens
the
street
-
door
,
and
four
small
children
forthwith
rush
out
,
and
scream
"
Coach
!
"
<EOS>
with
all
their
might
and
main
.
 
<EOS>
The
waterman
darts
from
the
pump
,
seizes
the
horses
by
their
respective
bridles
,
and
drags
them
,
and
the
coach
too
,
round
to
the
house
,
shouting
all
the
time
for
the
coachman
at
the
very
top
,
or
rather
very
bottom
of
his
voice
,
for
it
is
a
deep
bass
growl
.
 
<EOS>
A
response
is
heard
from
the
tap
-
room
;
the
coachman
,
in
his
wooden
-
soled
shoes
,
makes
the
street
echo
again
as
he
runs
across
it
;
and
then
there
is
such
a
struggling
,
and
backing
,
and
grating
of
the
kennel
,
to
get
the
coach
-
door
opposite
the
house
-
door
,
that
the
children
are
in
perfect
ecstasies
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
commotion
!
 
<EOS>
The
old
lady
,
who
has
been
stopping
there
for
the
last
month
,
is
going
back
to
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
Out
comes
box
after
box
,
and
one
side
of
the
vehicle
is
filled
with
luggage
in
no
time
;
the
children
get
into
everybody
's
way
,
and
the
youngest
,
who
has
upset
himself
in
his
attempts
to
carry
an
umbrella
,
is
borne
off
wounded
and
kicking
.
<EOS>
The
youngsters
disappear
,
and
a
short
pause
ensues
,
during
which
the
old
lady
is
,
no
doubt
,
kissing
them
all
round
in
the
back
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
She
appears
at
last
,
followed
by
her
married
daughter
,
all
the
children
,
and
both
the
servants
,
who
,
with
the
joint
assistance
of
the
coachman
and
waterman
,
manage
to
get
her
safely
into
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
A
cloak
is
handed
in
,
and
a
little
basket
,
which
we
could
almost
swear
contains
a
small
black
bottle
,
and
a
paper
of
sandwiches
.
 
<EOS>
Up
go
the
steps
<EOS>
,
bang
goes
the
door
,
"
Golden
-
cross
,
Charing
-
cross
,
Tom
,
"
says
the
waterman
;
"
Good
-
bye
,
grandma
,
"
cry
the
children
,
off
jingles
the
coach
at
the
rate
of
three
miles
an
hour
,
and
the
mamma
and
children
retire
into
the
house
,
with
the
exception
of
one
little
villain
,
who
runs
up
the
street
at
the
top
of
his
speed
,
pursued
by
the
servant
;
not
ill
-
pleased
to
have
such
an
opportunity
of
displaying
her
attractions
.
 
<EOS>
She
brings
him
back
,
and
,
after
casting
two
or
three
gracious
glances
across
the
way
,
which
are
either
intended
for
us
or
the
potboy
(
we
are
not
quite
certain
which
)
,
shuts
the
door
,
and
the
hackney
-
coach
stand
is
again
at
a
standstill
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
been
frequently
amused
with
the
intense
delight
with
which
"
a
servant
of
all
work
,
"
who
is
sent
for
a
coach
,
deposits
herself
inside
;
and
the
unspeakable
gratification
which
boys
,
who
have
been
despatched
on
a
similar
errand
,
appear
to
derive
from
mounting
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
never
recollect
to
have
been
more
amused
with
a
hackney
-
coach
party
,
than
one
we
saw
early
the
other
morning
in
Tottenham
-
court
-
road
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wedding
-
party
,
and
emerged
from
one
of
the
inferior
streets
near
Fitzroy
-
square
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
bride
,
with
a
thin
white
dress
,
and
a
great
red
face
;
and
the
bridesmaid
,
a
little
,
dumpy
,
good
-
humoured
young
woman
,
dressed
,
of
course
,
in
the
same
appropriate
costume
;
and
the
bridegroom
and
his
chosen
friend
,
in
blue
coats
,
yellow
waist
-
coats
,
white
trousers
,
and
Berlin
gloves
to
match
.
 
<EOS>
They
stopped
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
called
a
coach
with
an
air
of
indescribable
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
they
were
in
,
the
bridesmaid
threw
a
red
shawl
,
which
she
had
,
no
doubt
,
brought
on
purpose
,
negligently
over
the
number
on
the
door
,
evidently
to
delude
pedestrians
into
the
belief
that
the
hackney
-
coach
was
a
private
carriage
;
and
away
they
went
,
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
imposition
was
successful
,
and
quite
unconscious
that
there
was
a
great
staring
number
stuck
up
behind
,
on
a
plate
as
large
as
a
schoolboy
's
slate
.
 
<EOS>
A
shilling
a
mile
!
<EOS>
---
the
ride
was
worth
five
,
at
least
,
to
them
.
   
<EOS>
What
an
interesting
book
a
hackney
-
coach
might
produce
,
if
it
could
carry
as
much
in
its
head
as
it
does
in
its
body
!
 
<EOS>
The
autobiography
of
a
broken
-
down
hackney
-
coach
,
would
surely
be
as
amusing
as
the
autobiography
of
a
broken
-
down
hackneyed
dramatist
;
and
it
might
tell
as
much
of
its
travels
WITH
the
pole
,
as
others
have
of
their
expeditions
TO
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
stories
might
be
related
of

it

conveyed

Cabs
are
all
very
well
in
cases
of
expedition
,
when
it
's
a
matter
of
neck
or
nothing
,
life
or
death
,
your
temporary
home
or
your
long
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
besides
a
cab
's
lacking
that
gravity
of
deportment
which
so
peculiarly
distinguishes
a
hackney
-
coach
,
let
it
never
be
forgotten
that
a
cab
is
a
thing
of
yesterday
,
and
that
he
never
was
anything
better

<EOS>
A
hackney
-
cab
has
always
been
a
hackney
-
cab
,
from
his
first
entry
into
life
;
whereas
a
hackney
-
coach
is
a
remnant
of
past
gentility
,
a
victim
to
fashion
,
a
hanger
-
on
of
an
old
English
family
,
wearing
their
arms
,
and
,
in
days
of
yore
,
escorted
by
men
wearing
their
livery
,
stripped
of
his
finery
,
and
thrown
upon
the
world
,
like
a
once

smart
footman
when
he
is
no

sufficiently
juvenile

Walking
without

definite

through
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
<EOS>
a
little
while
ago
,
we
happened
to
turn
down
a
street
entitled
"
Paul's
-
chain
,
"
and
keeping
straight
forward
for
a
few
hundred
yards
,
found
ourself
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
in
Doctors
'
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
Now
Doctors
'
Commons
being
familiar
by
name
to
everybody
,
as
the
place
where
they
grant
marriage
-
licenses
to

-
sick

and
divorces
to
unfaithful

;
register
the
wills
of
people
who
have
any
property
to

,
and
punish
hasty
gentlemen
who
call
ladies
by
unpleasant
names
,
we
no
sooner
discovered
that
we
were
really
within
its
precincts
,
than
we
felt
a
laudable
desire
to
become
better
acquainted
therewith
;
and
as
the
first
object
of
our
curiosity
was
the
Court
,
whose
decrees
can
even
unloose
the
bonds
of
matrimony
,
we
procured
a
direction
to
it
;
and
bent
our
steps
thither
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
Crossing
a
quiet
and
shady
court
-
yard
,
paved
with
stone
,
and
frowned
upon
by
old
red
brick
houses
,
on
the
doors
of
which
were
painted
the
names
of
sundry
learned
civilians
,
we
paused
before
a
small
,
green
-
baized
,
brass
-
headed
-
nailed
door
,
which
yielding
to
our
gentle
push
,
at
once
admitted
us
into
an
old
quaint
-
looking
apartment
,
with
sunken
windows
,
and
black
carved
wainscoting
,
at
the
upper
end
of
which
,
seated
on
a
raised
platform
,
of
semicircular
shape
,
were
about
a
dozen
solemn
-
looking
gentlemen
,
in
crimson
gowns
and
wigs
.
   
<EOS>
At
a
more
elevated
desk
in
the
centre
,
sat
a
very
fat
and
red
-
faced
gentleman
,
in
tortoise
-
shell
spectacles
,
whose
dignified
appearance
announced
the
judge
;
and
round
a
long
green
-
baized
table
below
,
something
like
a
billiard
-
table
without
the
cushions
and
pockets
,
were
a
number
of
very
self
-
important
-
looking
personages
,
in
stiff
neckcloths
,
and
black
gowns
with
white
fur
collars
,
whom
we
at
once
set
down
as
proctors
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
lower
end
of
the
billiard
-
table
was
an
individual
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
and
a
wig
,
whom
we
afterwards
discovered
to
be
the
registrar
;
and
seated
behind
a
little
desk
,
near
the
door
,
were
a
respectable
-
looking
man
in
black
,
of
about
twenty
-
stone
weight
or
thereabouts
,
and
a
fat
-
faced
,
smirking
,
civil
-
looking
body
,
in
a
black
gown
,
black
kid
gloves
,
knee
shorts
,
and
silks
,
with
a
shirt
-
frill
in
his
bosom
,
curls
on
his
head
,
and
a
silver
staff
in
his
hand
,
whom
we
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
as
the
officer
of
the
Court
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
,
indeed
,
speedily
set
our
mind
at
rest
upon
this
point
,
for
,
advancing
to
our
elbow
,
and
opening
a
conversation
forthwith
<EOS>
,
he
had
communicated
to
us
,
in
less
than
five
minutes
,
that
he
was
the
apparitor
,
and
the
other
the
court
-
keeper
;
that
this
was
the
Arches
Court
,
and
therefore
the
counsel
wore
red
gowns
,
and
the
proctors
fur
collars
;
and
that
when
the
other
Courts
sat
there
,
they
did
n't
wear
red
gowns
or
fur
collars
either
;
with
many
other
scraps
of
intelligence
equally
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
these
two
officers
,
there
was
a
little
thin
old
man
,
with
long
grizzly
hair
,
crouched
in
a
remote
corner
,
<EOS>
whose
duty
,
our
communicative
friend
informed
us
,
was
to
ring
a
large
hand
-
bell
when
the
Court
opened
in
the
morning
,
and
who
,
for
aught
his
appearance
betokened
to
the
contrary
,
might
have
been
similarly
employed
for
the
last
two
centuries
at
least
.
   
<EOS>
The
red
-
faced
gentleman
in
the
tortoise
-
shell
spectacles
had
got
all
the
talk
to
himself
just
then
,
and
very
well
he
was
doing
it
,
too
,
only
he
spoke
very
fast
,
but
that
was
habit
;
and
rather
thick
,
but
that
was
good
living
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
had
plenty
of
time
to
look
about
us
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
individual
who
amused
us
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
one
of
the
bewigged
gentlemen
in
the
red
robes
,
who
was
straddling
before
the
fire
in
the
centre
of
the
Court
,
in
the
attitude
of
the
brazen
Colossus
,
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
everybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gathered
up
his
robe
behind
,
in
much
the
same
manner
as
a
slovenly
woman
<EOS>
would
her
petticoats
on
a
very
dirty
day
,
in
order
that
he
might
feel
the
full
warmth
of
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
His
wig
was
put
on
all
awry
,
with
the
tail
straggling
about
his
neck
;
his
scanty
grey
trousers
and
short
black
gaiters
,
made
in
the
worst
possible
style
,
imported
an
additional
inelegant
appearance
to
his
uncouth
person
;
and
his
limp
,
badly
-
starched
shirt
-
collar
almost
obscured
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
We
shall
never
be
able
to
claim
any
credit
as
a
physiognomist
again
,
for
,
after
a
careful
scrutiny
of
this
gentleman
's
countenance
,
we
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
bespoke
nothing
but
conceit
and
silliness
,
when
our
friend
with
the
silver
staff
whispered
in
our
ear
that
he
was
no
other
than
a
doctor
of
civil
law
,
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
.
 
<EOS>
So
of
course
we
were
mistaken
,
and
he
must
be
a
very
talented
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
conceals
it
so
well
though
---
perhaps
with
the
merciful
view
of
not
astonishing
ordinary
people
too
much
---
that
you
would
suppose
him
to
be
one
of
the
stupidest
dogs
alive
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
in
the
spectacles
having
concluded
his
judgment
,
and
a
few
minutes
having
been
allowed
to
elapse
,
to
afford
time
for
the
buzz
of
the
Court
to
subside
,
the
registrar
called
on
the
next
cause
,
which
was
"
the
office
of
the
Judge
promoted
by
Bumple
against
Sludberry
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
general
movement
was
visible
in
the
Court
,
at
this
announcement
,
and
the
obliging
functionary
with
silver
staff
whispered
us
that
"
there
would
be
some
fun
now
,
for
this
was
a
brawling
case
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
were
not
rendered
much
the
wiser
by
this
piece
of
information
,
till
we
found
by
the
opening
speech
of
the
counsel
for
the
promoter
,
that
,
under
a
half
-
obsolete
statute
of
one
of
the
Edwards
,
the
court
was
empowered
to
visit
with
the
penalty
of
excommunication
,
any
person
who
should
be
proved
guilty
of
the
crime
of
"
brawling
,
"
or
"
smiting
,
"
in
any
church
,
or
vestry
adjoining
thereto
;
and
it
appeared
,
by
some
eight
-
and
-
twenty
affidavits
,
which
were
duly
referred
to
,
that
on
a
certain
night
,
at
a
certain
vestry
-
meeting
,
in
a
certain
parish
particularly
set
forth
,
Thomas
Sludberry
,
the
party
appeared
against
in
that
suit
,
had
made
use
of
,
and
applied
to
Michael
Bumple
,
the
promoter
,
the
words
"
You
be
blowed
;
"
and
that
,
on
the
said
Michael
Bumple
and
others
remonstrating
with
the
said
Thomas
Sludberry
,
on
the
impropriety
of
his
conduct
,
the
said
Thomas
Sludberry
repeated
the
aforesaid
expression
,
"
You
be
blowed
;
"
and
furthermore
desired
and
requested
to
know
,
whether
the
said
Michael
Bumple
"
wanted
anything
for
himself
;
"
adding
,
"
that
if
the
said
Michael
Bumple
did
want
anything
for
himself
,
he
,
the
said
Thomas
Sludberry
,
was
the
man
to
give
it
him
;
"
at
the
same
time
making
use
of
other
heinous
and
sinful
expressions
,
all
of
which
,
Bumple
submitted
,
came
within
the
intent
and
meaning
of
the
Act
;
and
therefore
he
,
for
the
soul
's
health
and
chastening
of
Sludberry
,
prayed
for
sentence
of
excommunication
against
him
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
these
facts
a
long
argument
was
entered
into
,
on
both
sides
,
to
the
great
edification
of
a
number
of
persons
interested
in
the
parochial
squabbles
,
who
crowded
the
court
;
and
when
some
very
long
and
grave
speeches
had
been
made
PRO
and
CON
,
the
red
-
faced
gentleman
in
the
tortoise
-
shell
spectacles
took
a
review
of
the
case
,
which
occupied
half
an
hour
more
,
and
then
pronounced
upon
Sludberry
the
awful
sentence
of
excommunication
for
a
fortnight
,
and
payment
of
the
costs
of
the
suit
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Sludberry
,
who
was
a
little
,
red
-
faced
,
sly
-
looking
,
ginger
-
beer
seller
,
addressed
the
court
,
and
said
,
if
they
'd
be
good
enough
to
take
off
the
costs
,
and
excommunicate
him
for
the
term
of
his
natural
life
instead
,
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
to
him
,
for
he
never
went
to
church
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
appeal
the
gentleman
in
the
spectacles
made
no
other
reply
than
a
look
of
virtuous
indignation
;
and
Sludberry
and
his
friends
retired
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
man
with
the
silver
staff
informed
us
that
the
court
was
on
the
point
of
rising
,
we
retired
too
---
pondering
,
as
we
walked
away
,
upon
the
beautiful
spirit
of
these
ancient
ecclesiastical
laws
,
the
kind
and
neighbourly
feelings
they
are
calculated
to
awaken
,
and
the
strong
attachment
to
religious
institutions
which
they
can
not
fail
to
engender
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
so
lost
in
these
meditations
,
that
we
had
turned
into
the
street
,
and
run
up
against
a
door
-
post
,
before
we
recollected
where
we
were
walking
.
 
<EOS>
On
looking
upwards
to
see
what
house
we
had
stumbled
upon
,
the
words
"
Prerogative
-
Office
,
"
written
in
large
characters
,
met
our
eye
;
and
as
we
were
in
a
sight
-
seeing
humour
and
the
place
was
a
public
one
,
we
walked
in
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
into
which
we
walked
,
was
a
long
,
busy
-
looking
place
,
partitioned
off
,
on
either
side
,
into
a
variety
of
little
boxes
,
in
which
a
few
clerks
were
engaged
in
copying
or
examining
deeds
.
<EOS>
Down
the
centre
of
the
room
were
several
desks
nearly
breast
high
,
at
each
of
which
,
three
or
four
people
were
standing
,
poring
over
large
volumes
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
knew
that
they
were
searching
for
wills
,
they
attracted
our
attention
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
curious
to
contrast
the
lazy
indifference
of
the
attorneys
'
clerks
who
were
making
a
search
for
some
legal
purpose
,
with
the
air
of
earnestness
and
interest
which
distinguished
the
strangers
to
the
place
,
who
were
looking
up
the
will
of
some
deceased
relative
;
the
former
pausing
every
now
and
then
with
an
impatient
yawn
,
or
raising
their
heads
to
look
at
the
people
who
passed
up
and
down
the
room
;
the
latter
stooping
over
the
book
,
and
running
down
column
after
column
of
names
in
the
deepest
abstraction
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
one
little
dirty
-
faced
man
in
a
blue
apron
,
who
after
a
whole
morning
's
search
,
extending
some
fifty
years
back
,
had
just
found
the
will
to
which
he
wished
to
refer
,
which
one
of
the
officials
was
reading
to
him
in
a
low
hurried
voice
from
a
thick
vellum
book
with
large
clasps
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
evident
that
the
more
the
clerk
read
,
the
less
the
man
with
the
blue
apron
understood
about
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
volume
was
first
brought
down
,
he
took
off
his
hat
,
smoothed
down
his
hair
,
smiled
with
great
self
-
satisfaction
,
and
looked
up
in
the
reader
's
face
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
recollect
every
word
he
heard
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
two
or
three
lines
were
intelligible
enough
;
but
then
the
technicalities
began
,
and
the
little
man
began
to
look
rather
dubious
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
a
whole
string
of
complicated
trusts
,
and
he
was
regularly
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
reader
proceeded
,
it
was
quite
apparent
that
it
was
a
hopeless
case
,
and
the
little
man
,
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
,
looked
on
with
an
expression
of
bewilderment
and
perplexity
irresistibly
ludicrous
.
   
<EOS>
A
little
further
on
,
a
hard
-
featured
old
man
with
a
deeply
-
wrinkled
face
,
was
intently
perusing
a
lengthy
will
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
horn
spectacles
:
 
occasionally
pausing
from
his
task
,
and
slily
noting
down
some
brief
memorandum
of
the
bequests
contained
in
it
.
<EOS>
Every
wrinkle
about
his
toothless
mouth
,
and
sharp
keen
eyes
,
told
of
avarice
and
cunning
.
 
<EOS>
His
clothes
were
nearly
threadbare
,
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
wore
them
from
choice
and
not
from
necessity
;
all
his
looks
and
gestures
down
to
the
very
small
pinches
of
snuff
which
he
every
now
and
then
took
from
a
little
tin
canister
,
told
of
wealth
,
and
penury
,
and
avarice
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
leisurely
closed
the
register
,
put
up
his
spectacles
,
and
folded
his
scraps
of
paper
in
a
large
leathern
pocket
-
book
<EOS>
,
we
thought
what
a
nice
hard
bargain
he
was
driving
with
some
poverty
-
stricken
legatee
,
who
,
tired
of
waiting
year
after
year
,
until
some
life
-
interest
should
fall
in
,
was
selling
his
chance
,
just
as
it
began
to
grow
most
valuable
,
for
a
twelfth
part
of
its
worth
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
speculation
---
a
very
safe
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
stowed
his
pocket
-
book
carefully
in
the
breast
of
his
great
-
coat
,
and
hobbled
away
with
a
leer
of
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
That
will
had
made
him
ten
years
younger
at
the
lowest
computation
.
   
<EOS>
Having
commenced
our
observations
,
we
should
certainly
have
extended
them
to
another
dozen
of
people
at
least
,
had
not
a
sudden
shutting
up
and
putting
away
of
the
worm
-
eaten
old
books
,
warned
us
that
the
time
for
closing
the
office
had
arrived
;
and
thus
deprived
us
of
a
pleasure
,
and
spared
our
readers
an
infliction
.
   
<EOS>
We
naturally
fell
into
a
train
of
reflection
as
we
walked
homewards
,
upon
the
curious
old
records
of
likings
and
dislikings
;
of
jealousies
and
revenges
;
of
affection
defying
the
power
of
death
,
and
hatred
pursued
beyond
the
grave
,
which
these
depositories
contain
;
silent
but
striking
tokens
,
some
of
them
,
of
excellence
of
heart
,
and
nobleness
of
soul
;
melancholy
examples
,
others
,
of
the
worst
passions
of
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
men
as
they
lay
speechless
and
helpless
on
the
bed
of
death
,
would
have
given
worlds
but
for
the
strength
and
power
to
blot
out
the
silent
evidence
of
animosity
and
bitterness
,
which
now
stands
registered
against
them
in
Doctors

Commons

The
wish
of
persons
in
the
humbler
classes
of
life
,
to
ape
the
manners
and
customs
of
those
whom
fortune
has
placed
above
them
,
is
often
the
subject
of
remark
,
and
not
unfrequently
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
The
inclination
may
,
and
no
doubt
does
,
exist
to
a
great
extent
,
among
the
small
gentility
---
the
would

be
aristocrats
---
of
the
middle
classes
.
 
<EOS>
Tradesmen
and
clerks
,
with
fashionable
novel
-
reading
families
,
and
circulating
-
library
-
subscribing
daughters
,
get
up
small
assemblies
in
humble
imitation
of
Almack

,
and
promenade
the
dingy
"
large
room
"
of
some
second

rate
hotel
with
as
much
complacency
as
the
enviable
few
who
are
privileged
to
exhibit
their
magnificence
in
that
exclusive
haunt
of
fashion
and
foolery
.
<EOS>
Aspiring
young
ladies
,
who
read
flaming
accounts
of
some
"
fancy
fair
in
high
life
,
"
suddenly
grow
desperately
charitable
;
visions
of
admiration
and
matrimony
float
before
their
eyes
;
some
wonderfully
meritorious
institution
,
which
,
by
the
strangest
accident
in
the
world
,
has
never
been
heard
of
before
,
is
discovered
to
be
in
a
languishing
condition
:
 
<EOS>
Thomson
's
great
room
,
or
Johnson
's
nursery
-
ground
,
is
forthwith
engaged
,
and
the
aforesaid
young
ladies
,
from
mere
charity
,
exhibit
themselves
for
three
days
,
from
twelve
to
four
,
for
the
small
charge
of
one
shilling
per
head
!
 
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
these
classes
of
society
,
however
,
and
a
few
weak
and
insignificant
persons
,
we
do
not
think
the
attempt
at
imitation
to
which
we
have
alluded
,
prevails
in
any
great
degree
.
 
<EOS>
The
different
character
of
the
recreations
of
different
classes
,
has
often
afforded
us
amusement
;
and
we
have
chosen
it
for
the
subject
of
our
present
sketch
,
in
the
hope
that
it
may
possess
some
amusement
for
our
readers
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
regular
City
man
,
who
leaves
Lloyd
's
at
five
o'clock
,
and
drives
home
to
Hackney
,
Clapton
,
Stamford
-
hill
,
or
elsewhere
,
can
be
said
to
have
any
daily
recreation
beyond
his
dinner
,
it
is
his
garden
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
does
anything
to
it
with
his
own
hands
;
but
he
takes
great
pride
in
it
notwithstanding
;
and
if
you
are
desirous
of
paying
your
addresses
to
the
youngest
daughter
,
be
sure
to
be
in
raptures
with
every
flower
and
shrub
it
contains
.
 
<EOS>
If
your
poverty
of
expression
compel
you
to
make
any
distinction
between
the
two
,
we
would
certainly
recommend
your
bestowing
more
admiration
on
his
garden
than
his
wine
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
takes
a
walk
round
it
,
before
he
starts
for
town
in
the
morning
,
and
is
particularly
anxious
that
the
fish
-
pond
should
be
kept
specially
neat
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
call
on
him
on
Sunday
in
summer
-
time
,
about
an
hour
before
dinner
,
you
will
find
him
sitting
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
on
the
lawn
behind
the
house
,
with
a
straw
hat
on
,
reading
a
Sunday
paper
.
 
<EOS>
A
short
distance
from
him
<EOS>
you
will
most
likely
observe
a
handsome
paroquet
in
a
large
brass
-
wire
cage
;
ten
to
one
but
the
two
eldest
girls
are
loitering
in
one
of
the
side
<EOS>
walks
accompanied
by
a
couple
of
young
gentlemen
,
who
are
holding
parasols
over
them
---
of
course
only
to
keep
the
sun
off
---
while
the
younger
children
,
with
the
under
nursery
-
maid
,
are
strolling
listlessly
about
,
in
the
shade
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
these
occasions
,
his
delight
in
his
garden
appears
to
arise
more
from
the
consciousness
of
possession
than
actual
enjoyment
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
drives
you
down
to
dinner
on
a
week
-
day
,
he
is
rather
fatigued
with
the
occupations
of
the
morning
,
and
tolerably
cross
into
the
bargain
;
but
when
the
cloth
is
removed
,
and
he
has
drank
three
or
four
glasses
of
his
favourite
port
,
he
orders
the
French
windows
of
his
dining
-
room
(
which
of
course
look
into
the
garden
)
to
be
opened
,
and
throwing
a
silk
handkerchief
over
his
head
,
and
leaning
back
in
his
arm
-
chair
,
descants
at
considerable
length
upon
its
beauty
,
and
the
cost
of
maintaining
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
to
impress
you
---
who
are
a
young
friend
of
the
family
---
with
a
due
sense
of
the
excellence
of
the
garden
,
and
the
wealth
of
its
owner
;
and
when
he
has
exhausted
the
subject
,
he
goes
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
another
and
a
very
different
class
of
men
,
whose
recreation
is
their
garden
.
 
<EOS>
An
individual
of
this
class
,
resides
some
short
distance
from
town
---
say
in
the
Hampstead
-
road
,
or
the
Kilburn
-
road
,
or
any
other
road
where
the
houses
are
small
and
neat
,
and
have
little
slips
of
back
garden
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
wife
---
who
is
as
clean
and
compact
a
little
body
as
himself
---
have
occupied
the
same
house
ever
since
he
retired
from
business
twenty
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
family
.
 
<EOS>
They
once
had
a
son
,
who
died
at
about
five
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
's
portrait
hangs
over
the
mantelpiece
in
the
best
sitting
-
room
,
and
a
little
cart
he
used
to
draw
about
,
is
carefully
preserved
as
a
relic
.
   
<EOS>
In
fine
weather
the
old
gentleman
is
almost
constantly
in
the
garden
;
and
when
it
is
too
wet
to
go
into
it
,
he
will
look
out
of
the
window
at
it
,
by
the
hour
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
always
something
to
do
there
,
and
you
will
see
him
digging
,
and
sweeping
,
and
cutting
,
and
planting
,
with
manifest
delight
.
 
<EOS>
In
spring
-
time
,
there
is
no
end
to
the
sowing
of
seeds
,
and
sticking
little
bits
of
wood
over
them
,
with
labels
,
which
look
like
epitaphs
to
their
memory
;
and
in
the
evening
,
when
the
sun
has
gone
down
,
the
perseverance
with
which
he
lugs
a
great
watering
-
pot
about
is
perfectly
astonishing
.
<EOS>
The
only
other
recreation
he
has
,
is
the
newspaper
,
which
he
peruses
every
day
,
from
beginning
to
end
,
generally
reading
the
most
interesting
pieces
of
intelligence
to
his
wife
,
during
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
lady
is
very
fond
of
flowers
,
as
the
hyacinth
-
glasses
in
the
parlour
-
window
,
and
geranium
-
pots
in
the
little
front
court
,
testify
.
 
<EOS>
She
takes
great
pride
in
the
garden
too
:
and
when
one
of
the
four
fruit
-
trees
produces
rather
a
larger
gooseberry
than
usual
,
it
is
carefully
preserved
under
a
wine
-
glass
on
the
sideboard
,
for
the
edification
of
visitors
,
who
are
duly
informed
that
Mr
So
-
and
-
so
planted
the
tree
which
produced
it
,
with
his
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
summer
's
evening
,
when
the
large
watering
-
pot
has
been
filled
and
emptied
some
fourteen
times
,
and
the
old
couple
have
quite
exhausted
themselves
by
trotting
about
<EOS>
,
you
will
see
them
sitting
happily
together
in
the
little
summerhouse
,
enjoying
the
calm
and
peace
of
the
twilight
,
and
watching
the
shadows
as
they
fall
upon
the
garden
,
and
gradually
growing
thicker
and
more
sombre
,
obscure
the
tints
of
their
gayest
flowers
---
no
bad
emblem
of
the
years
that
have
silently
rolled
over
their
heads
,
deadening
in
their
course
the
brightest
hues
of
early
hopes
and
feelings
which
have
long
since
faded
away
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
their
only
recreations
,
and
they
require
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
within
themselves
,
the
materials
of
comfort
and
content
;
and
the
only
anxiety
of
each
,
is
to
die
before
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
no
ideal
sketch
.
 
<EOS>
There
USED
to
be
many
old
people
of
this
description
;
their
numbers
may
have
diminished
,
and
may
decrease
still
more
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
course
female
education
has
taken
of
late
days
---
whether
the
pursuit
of
giddy
frivolities
,
and
empty
nothings
,
has
tended
to
unfit
women
for
that
quiet
domestic
life
,
in
which
they
show
far
more
beautifully
than
in
the
most
crowded
assembly
,
is
a
question
we
should
feel
little
gratification
in
discussing
:
 
we
hope
not
.
   
<EOS>
Let
us
turn
now
,
to
another
portion
of
the
London
population
,
whose
recreations
present
about
as
strong
a
contrast
as
can
well
be
conceived
---
we
mean
the
Sunday
pleasurers
;
and
let
us
beg
our
readers
to
imagine
themselves
stationed
by
our
side
in
some
well
-
known
rural
"
Tea
-
gardens

The
heat
is
intense
this
afternoon
,
and
the
people
,
of
whom
there
are
additional
parties
arriving
every
moment
,
look
as
warm
as
the
tables
which
have
been
recently
painted
,
and
have
the
appearance
of
being
red
-
hot
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
dust
and
noise

<EOS>
Men
and
women
---
boys
and
girls
---
sweethearts
and
married
people
---
babies

cigars

Gentlemen

in
alarming
waistcoats

box
facetiously
observes

"
cutting

uncommon
fat

---
ladies
,
with
great
,
long

white
pocket

handkerchiefs
like
small
table
-
cloths
,
in
their
hands
,
chasing
one
another
on
the
grass
in
the
most
playful
and
interesting
manner
,
with
the
view
of
attracting
the
attention
of
the
aforesaid
gentlemen
---
husbands
in
perspective
ordering
bottles
of
ginger
-
beer
for
the
objects
of
their

with
a

of
expense

and
the
said
objects
washing
down
huge
quantities
of
"
shrimps
"
and
"
winkles
,
"
with
an
equal
disregard
of
their
own
bodily
health
and
subsequent
comfort
---
boys
,
with
great
silk
hats
just
balanced
on
the
top
of
their
heads
,
smoking
cigars

and
trying
to
look
as

they
liked
them
---
<EOS>
gentlemen
in
pink
shirts
and
blue
waistcoats
,
occasionally
upsetting
either
themselves
,
or
somebody
else
,
with
their
own
canes
.

Some
of
the
finery
of
these
people
provokes
a
smile
,
but
they
are
all
clean
,
and
happy
,
and
disposed
to
be
good
-
natured
and
sociable
.
<EOS>
Those
two
motherly
-
looking
women
in
the
smart
pelisses
,
who
are
chatting
so
confidentially
,
inserting
a
"
ma'am
"
at
every
fourth
word
,
scraped
an
acquaintance
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
:
 
<EOS>
it
originated
in
admiration
of
the
little
boy
who
belongs
to
one
of
them
---
that
diminutive
specimen
of
mortality
in
the
three

cornered
pink
satin

The
two
men
in
the
blue
coats
and
drab
trousers
,
who
are
walking
up
and
down
,
smoking
their
pipes

are
their
husbands
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
in
the
opposite
box
are
a
pretty
fair
specimen
of
the
generality
of
the
visitors
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
the
father
and
mother
,
and
old
grandmother
:
 
a
young
man
and
woman
,
and
an
individual
addressed
by
the
euphonious
title
of
"
Uncle
Bill
,
"
who
is
evidently
the
wit
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
some
half
-
dozen
children
with
them
,
but
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
notice
the
fact
,
for
that
is
a
matter
of
course
here
.
 
<EOS>
Every
woman
in
"
the
gardens
,
"
who
has
been
married
for
any
length
of
time
,
must
have
had
twins
on
two
or
three
occasions
;
it
is
impossible
to
account
for
the
extent
of
juvenile
population
in
any
other
way
.
   
<EOS>
Observe
the
inexpressible
delight
of
the
old
grandmother
,
at
Uncle
Bill
's
splendid
joke
of
"
tea
for
four
:
 
bread
-
and
-
butter
for
forty

"
and
the
loud
explosion
of
mirth
which
follows
his
wafering
a
paper
"
pigtail
"
on
the
waiter
's
collar
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
is
evidently
"
keeping
company
"
with
Uncle
Bill
's
niece
:

Uncle
Bill
's
hints

such
as
"
Do

I
'll
be
godfather
to
your

wager
<EOS>
it

a

and
so
forth
,
are
equally
embarrassing
to
the
young
people

delightful
to
the
elder
ones
.

As

the
old

she
is

perfect

nothing

It

the

begin

move

The
field
leading

quite
full

the

amuse
themselves
and
the
company
generally
by
crying
,
or
resort
to
the
much
more
pleasant
expedient
of
going
to
sleep

the
mothers
begin
to
wish
they
were
at
home
again
---
sweethearts
grow
more
sentimental
than
ever
,
as
the
time
for
parting
arrives
---
the

look
mournful
enough
,
by
the
light
of
the
two
lanterns
which
hang
against
the
trees
for
the
convenience
of
smokers
---
and
the
waiters
who
have
been
running
about
incessantly
for
the
last
six
hours

think
they
feel
a
little
tired

as
they
count
their
glasses

their

The
river
"
Are
you
fond
of
the
water
?
"
is
a
question
very
frequently
asked
,
in
hot
summer
weather
,
by
amphibious
-
looking
young
men
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
is
the
general
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
An't
you
?
"
---
<EOS>
"
Hardly
ever
off
it
,
"
is
the
response
,
accompanied
by
sundry
adjectives
,
expressive
of
the
speaker
's
heartfelt
admiration
of
that
element
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
with
all
respect
for
the
opinion
of
society
in
general
,
and
cutter
clubs
in
particular
,
we
humbly
suggest
that
some
of
the
most
painful
reminiscences
in
the
mind
of
every
individual
who
has
occasionally
disported
himself
on
the
Thames
,
must
be
connected
with
his
aquatic
recreations
.
 
<EOS>
Who
ever
heard
of
a
successful
water
-
party
?
<EOS>
---
or
to
put
the
question
in
a
still
more
intelligible
form
,
who
ever
saw
one
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
on
water
excursions
out
of
number
,
but
we
solemnly
declare
that
we
can
not
call
to
mind
one
single
occasion
of
the
kind
,
which
was
not
marked
by
more
miseries
than
any
one
would
suppose
could
be
reasonably
crowded
into
the
space
of
some
eight
or
nine
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Something
has
always
gone
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Either
the
cork
of
the
salad
-
dressing
has
come
out
,
or
the
most
anxiously
expected
member
of
the
party
has
not
come
out
,
or
the
most
disagreeable
man
in
company
would
come
out
,
or
a
child
or
two
have
fallen
into
the
water
,
or
the
gentleman
who
undertook
to
steer
has
endangered
everybody
's
life
all
the
way
,
or
the
gentlemen
who
volunteered
to
row
have
been
"
out
of
practice
,
"
and
performed
very
alarming
evolutions
,
putting
their
oars
down
into
the
water
and
not
being
able
to
get
them
up
again
,
or
taking
terrific
pulls
without
putting
them
in
at
all
;
in
either
case
,
pitching
over
on
the
backs
of
their
heads
with
startling
violence
,
and
exhibiting
the
soles
of
their
pumps
to
the
"
sitters
"
in
the
boat
,
in
a
very
humiliating
manner
.
   
<EOS>
We
grant
that
the
banks
of
the
Thames
are
very
beautiful
at
Richmond
and
Twickenham
,
and
other
distant
havens
,
often
sought
though
seldom
reached
;
but
from
the
"
Red
-
us
"
back
to
Blackfriars
-
bridge
,
the
scene
is
wonderfully
changed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Penitentiary
is
a
noble
building
,
no
doubt
,
and
the
sportive
youths
who
"
go
in
"
at
that
particular
part
of
the
river
,
on
a
summer
's
evening
,
may
be
all
very
well
in
perspective
;
but
when
you
are
obliged
to
keep
in
shore
coming
home
,
and
the
young
ladies
will
colour
up
,
and
look
perseveringly
the
other
way
,
while
the
married
dittos
cough
slightly
,
and
stare
very
hard
at
the
water
,
you
feel
awkward
---
especially
if
you
happen
to
have
been
attempting
the
most
distant
approach
to
sentimentality
,
for
an
hour
or
two
previously
.
   
<EOS>
Although
experience
and
suffering
have
produced
in
our
minds
the
result
we
have
just
stated
,
we
are
by
no
means
blind
to
a
proper
sense
of
the
fun
which
a
looker
-
on
may
extract
from
the
amateurs
of
boating

What
can
be
more
amusing
than
Searle
's
yard
on
a
fine
Sunday
morning
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
Richmond
tide
,
and
some
dozen
boats
are
preparing
for
the
reception
of
the
parties
who
have
engaged
them
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
fellows
in
great
rough
trousers
and
Guernsey
shirts
,
are
getting
them
ready
by
easy
stages
;
now
coming
down
the
yard
with
a
pair
of
sculls
and
a
cushion
---
then
having
a
chat
with
the
"
Jack
,
"
who
,
like
all
his
tribe
,
seems
to
be
wholly
incapable
of
doing
anything
but
lounging
about
---
then
going
back
again
,
and
returning
with
a
rudder
-
line
and
a
stretcher
---
then
solacing
themselves
with
another
chat
---
and
then
wondering
,
with
their
hands
in
their
capacious
pockets
,
"
where
them
gentlemen
's
got
to
as
ordered
the
six
.
"
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
,
the
head
man
,
with
the
legs
of
his
trousers
carefully
tucked
up
at
the
bottom
,
to
admit
the
water
,
we
presume
---
<EOS>
for
it
is
an
element
in
which
he
is
infinitely
more
at
home
than
on
land
---
is
quite
a
character
,
and
shares
with
the
defunct
oyster
-
swallower
the
celebrated
name
of
"
Dando
.
"
 
<EOS>
Watch
him
,
as
taking
a
few
minutes
'
respite
from
his
toils
,
he
negligently
seats
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
boat
,
and
fans
his
broad
bushy
chest
with
a
cap
scarcely
half
so
furry
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
his
magnificent
,
though
reddish
whiskers
,
and
mark
the
somewhat
native
humour
with
which
he
"
chaffs
"
the
boys
and
'
prentices
,
or
cunningly
gammons
the
gen'lm'n
into
the
gift
of
a
glass
of
gin
,
of
which
we
verily
believe
he
swallows
in
one
day
as
much
as
any
six
ordinary
men
,
without
ever
being
one
atom
the
worse
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
party
arrives
,
and
Dando
,
relieved
from
his
state
of
uncertainty
,
starts
up
into
activity
.
 
<EOS>
They
approach
in
full
aquatic
costume
,
with
round
blue
jackets
,
striped
shirts
,
and
caps
of
all
sizes
and
patterns
,
from
the
velvet
skull
-
cap
of
French
manufacture
,
to
the
easy
head
-
dress
familiar
to
the
students
of
the
old
spelling
-
books
,
as
having
,
on
the
authority
of
the
portrait
,
formed
part
of
the
costume
of
the
Reverend
Mr
Dilworth
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
the
most
amusing
time
to
observe
a
regular
Sunday
water
-
party
.
 
<EOS>
There
has
evidently
been
up
to
this
period
no
inconsiderable
degree
of
boasting
on
everybody
's
part
relative
to
his
knowledge
of
navigation
;
the
sight
of
the
water
rapidly
cools
their
courage
,
and
the
air
of
self
-
denial
with
which
each
of
them
insists
on
somebody
else
's
taking
an
oar
,
is
perfectly
delightful
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
a
great
deal
of
changing
and
fidgeting
,
consequent
upon
the
election
of
a
stroke
-
oar
:
 
the
inability
of
one
gentleman
to
pull
on
this
side
,
of
another
to
pull
on
that
,
and
of
a
third
to
pull
at
all
,
the
boat
's
crew
are
seated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shove
her
off
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
cockswain
,
who
looks
as
easy
and
comfortable
as
if
he
were
steering
in
the
Bay
of
Biscay
.
 
<EOS>
The
order
is
obeyed
;
the
boat
is
immediately
turned
completely
round
,
and
proceeds
towards
Westminster
-
bridge
,
amidst
such
a
splashing
and
struggling
as
never
was
seen
before
,
except
when
the
Royal
George
went
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
Back

shouts
Dando
,
"
<EOS>
Back

"
upon
which
everybody
thinking
he
must
be
the
individual
referred
to
,
they
all
back
water
,
and
back
comes
the
boat
,
stern
first
,
to
the
spot
whence
it
started
.
 
<EOS>
"
Back

in

frenzy
of
excitement
.
<EOS>
"
Pull

echoes
one
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tom
an't
for'ad

"
replies
another
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes

is

cries
a
third
;
and
the
unfortunate
young
man
,
at
the
imminent
risk
of
breaking
a
blood
-
vessel
,
pulls
and
pulls
,
until
the
head
of
the
boat
fairly
lies
in
the
direction
of
Vauxhall
-
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
---
now
pull
all
on
you

"
<EOS>
shouts
Dando
again
,
adding
,
in
an
under

tone
,
to
somebody
by
him
,
"
Blowed
if
hever
<EOS>
I
see
sich
a
set
of
muffs
!
"
<EOS>
and
away
jogs
the
boat
in
a
zigzag
direction
,
every
one
of
the
six
oars
dipping
into
the
water
at
a
different
time
;
and
the
yard
is
once
more
clear
,
until
the
arrival
of
the
next
party
.
   
<EOS>
A
well
-
contested
rowing
-
match
on
the
Thames
,
is
a
very
lively
and
interesting
scene
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
is
studded
with
boats
of
all
sorts
,
kinds
,
and
descriptions
;
places
in
the
coal
-
barges
at
the
different
wharfs
are
let
to
crowds
of
spectators
,
beer
and
tobacco
flow
freely
about
;
men
,
women
,
and
children
wait
for
the
start
in
breathless
expectation
;
cutters
of
six
and
eight
oars
glide
gently
up
and
down
,
waiting
to
accompany
their
PROTEGES
during
the
race
;
bands
of
music
add
to
the
animation
,
if
not
to
the
harmony
of
the
scene
;
groups
of
watermen
are
assembled
at
the
different
stairs
,
discussing
the
merits
of
the
respective
candidates
;
and
the
prize
wherry
,
which
is
rowed
slowly
about
by
a
pair
of
sculls
,
is
an
object
of
general
interest
.
   
<EOS>
Two
o'clock
strikes
,
and
everybody
looks
anxiously
in
the
direction
of
the
bridge
through
which
the
candidates
for
the
prize
will
come
---
half
-
past
two
,
and
the
general
attention
which
has
been
preserved
so
long
begins
to
flag
,
when
suddenly
a
gun
is
heard
,
and
a
noise
of
distant
hurra'ing
along
each
bank
of
the
river
<EOS>
---
every
head
is
bent
forward
---
the
noise
draws
nearer
and
nearer
---
the
boats
which
have
been
waiting
at
the
bridge
start
briskly
up
the
river
,
and
a
well
-
manned
galley
shoots
through
the
arch
,
the
sitters
cheering
on
the
boats
behind
them
,
which
are
not
yet
visible

<EOS>
"
Here

is
the
general
cry
---
and
through
darts
the
first
boat
,
the
men
in
her
,
stripped
to
the
skin
,
and
exerting
every
muscle
to
preserve
the
advantage
they
have
gained
---
four
other
boats
follow
close
astern
;
there
are
not
two
boats
'
length
between
them
---
the
shouting
is
tremendous
,
and
the
interest
intense

Every
little
public
-
house
fires
its
gun
,
and
hoists
its
flag
;
and
the
men
who
win
the
heat
,
come
in
,
amidst
a
splashing
and
shouting
,
and
banging
and
confusion
,
which
no
one
can
imagine
who
has
not
witnessed
it
,
and
of
which
any
description
would
convey
a
very
faint
idea

<EOS>
One
of
the
most
amusing
places
we
know
is
the
steam
-
wharf
of
the
London
Bridge
,
or
St
Katharine
's
Dock
Company
,
on
a
Saturday
morning
in
summer
,
when
the
Gravesend
and
Margate
steamers
are
usually
crowded
to
excess
;
and
as
we
have
just
taken
a
glance
at
the
river
above
bridge
,
we
hope
our
readers
will
not
object
to
accompany
us
on
board
a
Gravesend
packet
.
   
<EOS>
Coaches
are
every
moment
setting
down
at
the
entrance
to
the
wharf
,
and
the
stare
of
bewildered
astonishment
with
which
the
"
fares
"
resign
themselves
and
their
luggage
into
the
hands
of
the
porters
,
who
seize
all
the
packages
at
once
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
run
away
with
them
,
heaven
knows
where
,
is
laughable
in
the
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
A
Margate
boat
lies
alongside
the
wharf
,
the
Gravesend
boat
(
which
starts
first
)
lies
alongside
that
again
;
and
as
a
temporary
communication
is
formed
between
the
two
,
by
means
of
a
plank
and
hand
-
rail
,
the
natural
confusion
of
the
scene
is
by
no
means
diminished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gravesend
?
"
inquires
a
stout
father
of
a
stout
family
,
who
follow
him
,
under
the
guidance
of
their
mother
,
and
a
servant
,
at
the
no
small
risk
of
two
or
three
of
them
being
left
behind
in
the
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gravesend
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pass
on
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
replies
the
attendant
---
"
other
boat
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Hereupon
the
stout
father
,
being
rather
mystified
,
and
the
stout
mother
rather
distracted
by
maternal
anxiety
<EOS>
,
the
whole
party
deposit
themselves
in
the
Margate
boat
,
and
after
having
congratulated
himself
on
having
secured
very
comfortable
seats
,
the
stout
father
sallies
to
the
chimney
to
look
for
his
luggage
,
which
he
has
a
faint
recollection
of
having
given
some
man
,
something
,
to
take
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
No
luggage
,
however
,
bearing
the
most
remote
resemblance
to
his
own
,
in
shape
or
form
,
is
to
be
discovered
;
on
which
the
stout
father
calls
very
loudly
for
an
officer
,
to
whom
he
states
the
case
,
in
the
presence
of
another
father
of
another
family
---
a
little
thin
man
---
who
entirely
concurs
with
him
(
the
stout
father
)
in
thinking
that
it
's
high
time
something
was
done
with
these
steam
companies
,
and
that
as
the
Corporation
Bill
failed
to
do
it
,
something
else
must
;
for
really
people
's
property
is
not
to
be
sacrificed
in
this
way
;
and
that
if
the
luggage
is
n't
restored
without
delay
,
he
will
take
care
it
shall
be
put
in
the
papers
,
for
the
public
is
not
to
be
the
victim
of
these
great
monopolies
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
,
the
officer
,
in
his
turn
,
replies
,
that
that
company
,
ever
since
it
has
been
St
Kat'rine
's
Dock
Company
,
has
protected
life
and
property
;
that
if
it
had
been
the
London
Bridge
Wharf
Company
,
indeed
,
he
should
n't
have
wondered
,
seeing
that
the
morality
of
that
company
(
they
being
the
opposition
)
ca
n't
be
answered
for
,
by
no
one
;
but
as
it
is
,
he
's
convinced
there
must
be
some
mistake
,
and
he
would
n't
mind
making
a
solemn
oath
afore
a

that
the

find

his

afore
<EOS>
he
gets
to
Margate
.
   
<EOS>
Here
the
stout
father
,
thinking
he
is
making
a
capital
point
,
replies
,
that
as
it
happens
,
he
is
not
going
to
Margate
at
all
,
and
that
"
Passenger
to
Gravesend
"
was
on
the
luggage
,
in
letters
of
full
two
inches
long
;
on
which
the
officer
rapidly
explains
the
mistake
,
and
the
stout
mother
,
and
the
stout
children
,
and
the
servant
,
are
hurried
with
all
possible
despatch
on
board
the
Gravesend
boat
,
which
they
reached
just
in
time
to
discover
that
their
luggage
is
there
,
and
that
their
comfortable
seats
are
not
.
<EOS>
Then
the
bell
,
which
is
the
signal
for
the
Gravesend
boat
starting
,
begins
to
ring
most
furiously
:
 
and
people
keep
time
to
the
bell
,
by
running
in
and
out
of
our
boat
at
a
double
-
quick
pace
.
 
<EOS>
The
bell
stops
;
the
boat
starts
:
 
people
who
have
been
taking
leave
of
their
friends
on
board
,
are
carried
away
against
their
will
;
and
people
who
have
been
taking
leave
of
their
friends
on
shore
,
find
that
they
have
performed
a
very
needless
ceremony
,
in
consequence
of
their
not
being
carried
away
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
regular
passengers
,
who
have
season
tickets
,
go
below
to
breakfast
;
people
who
have
purchased
morning
papers
,
compose
themselves
to
read
them
;
and
people
who
have
not
been
down
the
river
before
,
think
that
both
the
shipping
and
the
water
,
look
a
great
deal
better
at
a
distance
.
   
<EOS>
When
we

down
about
as
far
as
Blackwall

the

of

Old

plays
the

expression

partly

on

Mr

may
be

remarks
in
a
low
voice
that
he
has
been
quite
insensible
of
late
to
the
beauties
of

,
that
his

whereupon
the

looks
up

failing

looks
down
again

turns
over

Novel

of

are
generally
the
commencement
of
a

which
is
prolonged
until
the
conclusion

and
,
perhaps
,
lays
the
foundation
of
a

half

Astley
's
We
never
see
any
very
large
,
staring
,
black
Roman
capitals
,
in
a
book
,
or
shop
-
window
,
or
placarded
on
a
wall
,
without
their
immediately
recalling
to
our
mind
an
indistinct
and
confused
recollection
of
the
time
when
we
were
first
initiated
in
the
mysteries
of
the
alphabet
.
 
<EOS>
We
almost
fancy
<EOS>
we
see
the
pin
's
point
following
the
letter
,
to
impress
its
form
more
strongly
on
our
bewildered
imagination
;
and
wince
involuntarily
,
as
we
remember
the
hard
knuckles
with
which
the
reverend
old
lady
who
instilled
into
our
mind
the
first
principles
of
education
for
ninepence
per
week
,
or
ten
and
sixpence
per
quarter
,
was
wo
nt
to
poke
our
juvenile
head
occasionally
,
by
way
of
adjusting
the
confusion
of
ideas
in
which
we
were
generally
involved
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
kind
of
feeling
pursues
us
in
many
other
instances
,
but
there
is
no
place
which
recalls
so
strongly
our
recollections
of
childhood
as
Astley
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
"
Royal
Amphitheatre
"
in
those
days
,
nor
had
Ducrow
arisen
to
shed
the
light
of
classic
taste
and
portable
gas
over
the
sawdust
of
the
circus
;
but
the
whole
character
of
the
place
was
the
same
,
the
pieces
were
the
same
,
the
clown
's
jokes
were
the
same
,
the
riding
-
masters
were
equally
grand
,
the
comic
performers
equally
witty
,
the
tragedians
equally
hoarse
,
and
the
"
highly
-
trained
chargers
"
equally
spirited
.
 
<EOS>
Astley
's
has
altered
for
the
better
---
we
have
changed
for
the
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Our
histrionic
taste
is
gone
,
and
with
shame
we
confess
,
that
we
are
far
more
delighted
and
amused
with
the
audience
,
than
with
the
pageantry
we
once
so
highly
appreciated
.
   
<EOS>
We
like
to
watch
a
regular
Astley
's
party
in
the
Easter
or
Midsummer
holidays
---
pa
and
ma
,
and
nine
or
ten
children
,
varying
from
five
foot
six
to
two
foot
eleven
:
 
from
fourteen
years
of
age
to
four
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
just
taken
our
seat
in
one
of
the
boxes
,
in
the
centre
of
the
house
,
the
other
night
,
when
the
next
was
occupied
by
just
such
a
party
as
we
should
have
attempted
to
describe
,
had
we
depicted
our
BEAU
IDEAL
of
a
group
of
Astley
's
visitors
.
   
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
there
came
three
little
boys
and
a
little
girl
,
who
,
in
pursuance
of
pa
's
directions
,
issued
in
a
very
audible
voice
from
the
box
-
door
,
occupied
the
front
row
;
then
two
more
little
girls
were
ushered
in
by
a
young
lady
,
evidently
the
governess
.
<EOS>
Then
came
three
more
little
boys
,
dressed
like
the
first
,
in
blue
jackets
and
trousers
,
with
lay
-
down
shirt
-
collars
:
 
then
a
child
in
a
braided
frock
and
high
state
of
astonishment
,
with
very
large
round
eyes
,
opened
to
their
utmost
width
,
was
lifted
over
the
seats
---
a
process
which
occasioned
a
considerable
display
of
little
pink
legs
---
then
came
ma
and
pa
,
and
then
the
eldest
son
,
a
boy
of
fourteen
years
old
,
who
was
evidently
trying
to
look
as
if
he
did
not
belong
to
the
family
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
five
minutes
were
occupied
in
taking
the
shawls
off
the
little
girls
,
and
adjusting
the
bows
which
ornamented
their
hair
;
then
it
was
providentially
discovered
that
one
of
the
little
boys
was
seated
behind
a
pillar
and
could
not
see
,
so
the
governess
was
stuck
behind
the
pillar
,
and
the
boy
lifted
into
her
place
.
 
<EOS>
Then
pa
drilled
the
boys
,
and
directed
the
stowing
away
of
their
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
and
ma
having
first
nodded
and
winked
to
the
governess
to
pull
the
girls
'
frocks
a
little
more
off
their
shoulders
,
stood
up
to
review
the
little
troop
---
an
inspection
which
appeared
to
terminate
much
to
her
own
satisfaction
,
for
she
looked
with
a
complacent
air
at
pa
,
who
was
standing
up
at
the
further
end
of
the
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Pa
returned
the
glance
,
and
blew
his
nose
very
emphatically
;
and
the
poor
governess
peeped
out
from
behind
the
pillar
,
and
timidly
tried
to
catch
ma
's
eye
,
with
a
look
expressive
of
her
high
admiration
of
the
whole
family
.
 
<EOS>
Then
two
of
the
little
boys
who
had
been
discussing
the
point
whether
Astley
's
was
more
than
twice
as
large
as
Drury
Lane
,
agreed
to
refer
it
to
"
George
"
for
his
decision
;
at
which
"
George
,
"
who
was
no
other
than
the
young
gentleman
before
noticed
,
waxed
indignant
,
and
remonstrated
in
no
very
gentle
terms
on
the
gross
impropriety
of
having
his
name
repeated
in
so
loud
a
voice
at
a
public
place
,
on
which
all
the
children
laughed
very
heartily
,
and
one
of
the
little
boys
wound
up
by
expressing
his
opinion
,
that
"
George
began
to
think
himself
quite
a
man
now
,
"
whereupon
both
pa
and
ma
laughed
too
;
and
George
(
who
carried
a
dress
cane
and
was
cultivating
whiskers
)
muttered
that
"
William
always
was
encouraged
in
his
impertinence
;
"
and
assumed
a
look
of
profound
contempt
,
which
lasted
the
whole
evening
.
   
<EOS>
The
play
began
,
and
the
interest
of
the
little
boys
knew
no
bounds
.
<EOS>
Pa
was
clearly
interested
too
,
although
he
very
unsuccessfully
endeavoured
to
look
as
if
he
was
n't
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
ma
,
she
was
perfectly
overcome
by
the
drollery
of
the
principal
comedian
,
and
laughed
till
every
one
of
the
immense
bows
on
her
ample
cap
trembled
,
at
which
the
governess
peeped
out
from
behind
the
pillar
again
,
and
whenever
she
could
catch
ma
's
eye
,
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
,
and
appeared
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
to
be
in
convulsions
of
laughter
also
.
 
<EOS>
Then
when
the
man
in
the
splendid
armour
vowed
to
rescue
the
lady
or
perish
in
the
attempt
,
the
little
boys
applauded
vehemently
,
especially
one
little
fellow
who
was
apparently
on
a
visit
to
the
family
,
and
had
been
carrying
on
a
child
's
flirtation
,
the
whole
evening
,
with
a
small
coquette
of
twelve
years
old
,
who
looked
like
a
model
of
her
mamma
on
a
reduced
scale
;
and
who
,
in
common
with
the
other
little
girls
(
who
generally
speaking
have
even
more
coquettishness
about
them
than
much
older
ones
)
,
looked
very
properly
shocked
,
when
the
knight
's
squire
kissed
the
princess
's
confidential
chambermaid
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
scenes
in
the
circle
commenced
,
the
children
were
more
delighted
than
ever
;
and
the
wish
to
see
what
was
going
forward
,
completely
conquering
pa
's
dignity
,
he
stood
up
in
the
box
,
and
applauded
as
loudly
as
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Between
each
feat
of
horsemanship
,
the
governess
leant
across
to
ma
,
and
retailed
the
clever
remarks
of
the
children
on
that
which
had
preceded
:
 
and
ma
,
in
the
openness
of
her
heart
,
offered
the
governess
an
acidulated
drop
,
and
the
governess
,
gratified
to
be
taken
notice
of
,
retired
behind
her
pillar
again
with
a
brighter
countenance
:
 
and
<EOS>
the
whole
party
seemed
quite
happy
,
except
the
exquisite
in
the
back
of
the
box
,
who
,
being
too
grand
to
take
any
interest
in
the
children
,
and
too
insignificant
to
be
taken
notice
of
by
anybody
else
,
occupied
himself
,
from
time
to
time
,
in
rubbing
the
place
where
the
whiskers
ought
to
be
,
and
was
completely
alone
in
his
glory
.
   
<EOS>
We
defy
any
one
who
has
been
to
Astley
's
two
or
three
times
,
and
is
consequently
capable
of
appreciating
the
perseverance
with
which
precisely
the
same
jokes
are
repeated
night
after
night
,
and
season
after
season
,
not
to
be
amused
with
one
part
of
the
performances
at
least
---
we
mean
the
scenes
in
the
circle
.
 
<EOS>
For
ourself
,
we
know
that
when
the
hoop
,
composed
of
jets
of
gas
,
is
let
down
,
the
curtain
drawn
up
for
the
convenience
of
the
half
-
price
on
their
ejectment
from
the
ring
,
the
orange
-
peel
cleared
away
,
and
the
sawdust
shaken
,
with
mathematical
precision
,
into
a
complete
circle
,
we
feel
as
much
enlivened
as
the
youngest
child
present
;
and
actually
join
in
the
laugh
which
follows
the
clown
's
shrill
shout
of
"
Here
we
are
!
"
<EOS>
just
for
old
acquaintance
"
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
can
we
quite
divest
ourself
of
our
old
feeling
of
reverence
for
the
riding
-
master
,
who
follows
the
clown
with
a
long
whip
in
his
hand
,
and
bows
to
the
audience
with
graceful
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
none
of
your
second
-
rate
riding
-
masters
in
nankeen
dressing
-
gowns
,
with
brown
frogs
,
but
the
regular
gentleman
-
attendant
on
the
principal
riders
,
who
always
wears
a
military
uniform
with
a
table
-
cloth
inside
the
breast
of
the
coat
,
in
which
costume
<EOS>
he
forcibly
reminds
one
of
a
fowl
trussed
for
roasting
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
---
but
why
should
we
attempt
to
describe
that
of
which
no
description
can
convey
an
adequate
idea
?
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
the
man
,
and
everybody
remembers
his
polished
boots
,
his
graceful
demeanour
,
stiff
,
as
some
misjudging
persons
have
in
their
jealousy
considered
it
,
and
the
splendid
head
of
black
hair
,
parted
high
on
the
forehead
,
to
impart
to
the
countenance
an
appearance
of
deep
thought
and
poetic
melancholy
.
<EOS>
His
soft
and
pleasing
voice
,
too
,
is
in
perfect
unison
with
his
noble
bearing
,
as
he
humours
the
clown
by
indulging
in
a
little
badinage
;
and
the
striking
recollection
of
his
own
dignity
,
with
which
he
exclaims
,
"
Now
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
inquire
for
Miss
Woolford
,
sir
,
"
can
never
be
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
The
graceful
air
,
too
,
with
which
he
introduces
Miss
Woolford
into
the
arena
,
and
,
after
assisting
her
to
the
saddle
,
follows
her
fairy
courser
round
the
circle
,
can
never
fail
to
create
a
deep
impression
in
the
bosom
of
every
female
servant
present
.
   
<EOS>
When
Miss
Woolford
,
and
the
horse
,
and
the
orchestra
,
all
stop
together
to
take
breath
,
he
urbanely
takes
part
in
some
such
dialogue
as
the
following
(
commenced
by
the
clown
)
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
Well
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
(
it
's
always
conducted
in
the
politest
manner
.
)
<EOS>
---
"
Did
you
ever
happen
to
hear
I
was
in
the
army
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
No
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
Oh
,
yes
,
sir
---
I
can
go
through
my
exercise
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
Indeed
,
sir
!
"
---
"
Shall
I
do
it
now
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
If
you
please
,
sir
;
come
,
sir
---
make
haste
"
(
a
cut
with
the
long
whip
,
and
<EOS>
"
Ha
'
done
now
---
I
do
n't
like
it
,
"
from
the
clown
)
.
 
<EOS>
Here
the
clown
throws
himself
on
the
ground
,
and
goes
through
a
variety
of
gymnastic
convulsions
,
doubling
himself
up
,
and
untying
himself
again
,
and
making
himself
look
very
like
a
man
in
the
most
hopeless
extreme
of
human
agony
,
to
the
vociferous
delight
of
the
gallery
,
until
he
is
interrupted
by
a
second
cut
from
the
long
whip
,
and
a
request
to
see
"
<EOS>
what
Miss
Woolford
's
stopping
for
?
"
 
<EOS>
On
which
,
to
the
inexpressible
mirth
of
the
gallery
,
he
exclaims
,
"
Now
,
Miss
Woolford
,
what
can
I
come
for
to
go
,
for
to
fetch
,
for
to
bring
,
for
to
carry
,
for
to
do
,
for
you
,
ma'am
?
"
 
<EOS>
On
the
lady
's
announcing
with
a
sweet
smile
that
she
wants
the
two
flags
,
they
are
,
with
sundry
grimaces
,
procured
and
handed
up
;
the
clown
facetiously
observing
after
the
performance
of
the
latter
ceremony
---
"
<EOS>
He
,
he
,
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
sir
,
Miss
Woolford
knows
me
;
she
smiled
at
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Another
cut
from
the
whip
,
a
burst
from
the
orchestra
,
a
start
from
the
horse
,
and
round
goes
Miss
Woolford
again
on
her
graceful
performance
,
to
the
delight
of
every
member
of
the
audience
,
young
or
old
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
pause
affords
an
opportunity
for
similar
witticisms
,
the
only
additional
fun
being
that
of
the
clown
making
ludicrous
grimaces
at
the
riding
-
master
every
time
his
back
is
turned
;
and
finally
quitting
the
circle
by
jumping
over
his
head
,
having
previously
directed
his
attention
another
way
.
   
<EOS>
Did
any
of
our
readers
ever
notice
the
class
of
people
,
who
hang
about
the
stage
-
doors
of
our
minor
theatres
in
the
daytime
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
rarely
pass
one
of
these
entrances
without
seeing
a
group
of
three
or
four
men
conversing
on
the
pavement
,
with
an
indescribable
public
-
house
-
parlour
swagger
,
and
a
kind
of
conscious
air
,
peculiar
to
people
of
this
description
.
 
<EOS>
They
always
seem
to
think
they
are
exhibiting
;
the
lamps
are
ever
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
young
fellow
in
the
faded
brown
coat
,
and
very
full
light
green
trousers
,
pulls
down
the
wristbands
of
his
check
shirt
,
as
ostentatiously
as
if
it
were
of
the
finest
linen
,
and
cocks
the
white
hat
of
the
summer
-
before
-
last
as
knowingly
over
his
right
eye
,
as
if
it
were
a
purchase
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
the
dirty
white
Berlin
gloves
,
and
the
cheap
silk
handkerchief
stuck
in
the
bosom
of
his
threadbare
coat
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
to
see
him
for
an
instant
,
and
not
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
is
the
walking
gentleman
who
wears
a
blue
surtout
,
clean
collar
,
and
white
trousers
,
for
half
an
hour
,
and
then
shrinks
into
his
worn
-
out
scanty
clothes
:
 
who
has
to
boast
night
after
night
of
his
splendid
fortune
,
with
the
painful
consciousness
of
a
pound
a
-
week
and
his
boots
to
find
;
to
talk
of
his
father
's
mansion
in
the
country
,
with
a
dreary
recollection
of
his
own
two
-
pair
back
,
in
the
New
Cut
;
and
to
be
envied
and
flattered
as
the
favoured
lover
of
a
rich
heiress
,
remembering
all
the
while
that
the
ex
-
dancer
at
home
is
in
the
family
way
,
and
out
of
an
engagement
?
   
<EOS>
Next
to
him
,
perhaps
,
you
will
see
a
thin
pale
man
,
with
a
very
long
face
,
in
a
suit
of
shining
black
,
thoughtfully
knocking
that
part
of
his
boot
which
once
had
a
heel
,
with
an
ash
stick
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
man
who
does
the
heavy
business
,
such
as
prosy
fathers
,
virtuous
servants
,
curates
,
landlords
,
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
talking
of
fathers
,
we
should
very
much
like
to
see
some
piece
in
which
all
the
dramatis
personae
were
orphans
.
<EOS>
Fathers
are
invariably
great
nuisances
on
the
stage
,
and
always
have
to
give
the
hero
or
heroine
a
long
explanation
of
what
was
done
before
the
curtain
rose
,
usually
commencing
with
"
<EOS>
It
is
now
nineteen
years
,
my
dear
child
,
since
your
blessed
mother
(
here
the
old
villain
's
voice
falters
)
confided
you
to
my
charge
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
then
an
infant
,
"
&
c
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
Or
else
they
have
to
discover
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
that
somebody
whom
they
have
been
in
constant
communication
with
,
during
three
long
acts
,
without
the
slightest
suspicion
,
is
their
own
child
:
 
<EOS>
in
which
case
they
exclaim
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
do
I
see
?
<EOS>
This
bracelet
!
 
<EOS>
That
smile
!
 
<EOS>
These
documents
!
 
<EOS>
Those
eyes
!
 
<EOS>
Can
I
believe
my
senses
?
<EOS>
---
It
must
be
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Yes
---
it
is
,
it
is
my
child
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
My
father
!
<EOS>
"
exclaims
the
child
;
and
they
fall
into
each
other
's
arms
,
and
look
over
each
other
's
shoulders
,
and
the
audience
give
three
rounds
of
applause
.
   
<EOS>
To
return
from
this
digression
,
we
were
about
to
say
,
that
these
are
the
sort
of
people
whom
you
see
talking
,
and
attitudinising
,
outside
the
stage
-
doors
of
our
minor
theatres
.
 
<EOS>
At
Astley
's
they
are
always
more
numerous
than
at
any
other
place
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
generally
a
groom
or
two
,
sitting
on
the
window
-
sill
,
and
two
or
three
dirty
shabby
-
genteel
men
in
checked
neckerchiefs
,
and
sallow
linen
,
lounging
about
,
and
carrying
,
perhaps
,
under
one
arm
,
a
pair
of
stage
shoes
badly
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
old
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
Some
years
ago
we
used
to
stand
looking
,
open
-
mouthed
,
at
these
men
,
with
a
feeling
of
mysterious
curiosity
,
the
very
recollection
of
which
provokes
a
smile
at
the
moment
we
are
writing
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
believe
that
the
beings
of
light
and
elegance
,
in
milk
-
white
tunics
,
salmon
-
coloured
legs
,
and
blue
scarfs
,
who
flitted
on
sleek
cream
-
coloured
horses
before
our
eyes
at
night
,
with
all
the
aid
of
lights
,
music
,
and
artificial
flowers
,
could
be
the
pale
,
dissipated
-
looking
creatures
we
beheld
by
day
.
   
<EOS>
We
can
hardly
believe
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
lower
class
of
actors
we
have
seen
something
,
and
it
requires
no
great
exercise
of
imagination
to
identify
the
walking
gentleman
with
the
"
dirty
swell
,
"
the
comic
singer
with
the
public
-
house
chairman
,
or
the
leading
tragedian
with
drunkenness
and
distress
;
but
these
other
men
are
mysterious
beings
,
never
seen
out
of
the
ring
,
never
beheld
but
in
the
costume
of
gods
and
sylphs
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
Ducrow
,
who
can
scarcely
be
classed
among
them
,
who
ever
knew
a
rider
at
Astley
's
,
or
saw
him
but
on
horseback
?
 
<EOS>
Can
our
friend
in
the
military
uniform
ever
appear
in
threadbare
attire
,
or
descend
to
the
comparatively
un
-
wadded
costume
of
every
-
day
life
?
 
<EOS>
Impossible
!
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
---
we
will
not
---
believe
it
.

Greenwich
Fair
<EOS>
If
the
Parks
be
"
the
lungs
of
London
,
"
we
wonder
what
Greenwich
Fair
is
---
a
periodical
breaking
out
,
we
suppose
,
a
sort
of
spring
-
rash
:
 
a
three
days
'
fever
,
which
cools
the
blood
for
six
months
afterwards
,
and
at
the
expiration
of
which
London
is
restored
to
its
old
habits
of
plodding
industry
,
as
suddenly
and
completely
as
if
nothing
had
ever
happened
to
disturb
them
.
   
<EOS>
In
our
earlier
days
,
we
were
a
constant
frequenter
of
Greenwich
Fair
,
for
years
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
proceeded
to
,
and
returned
from
it
,
in
almost
every
description
of
vehicle
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
conscientiously
deny
the
charge
of
having
once
made
the
passage
in
a
spring
-
van
,
accompanied
by
thirteen
gentlemen
,
fourteen
ladies
,
an
unlimited
number
of
children
,
and
a
barrel
of
beer
;
and
we
have
a
vague
recollection
of
having
,
in
later
days
,
found
ourself
the
eighth
outside
,
on
the
top
of
a
hackney
-
coach
,
at
something
past
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
with
a
rather
confused
idea
of
our
own
name
,
or
place
of
residence
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
grown
older
since
then
,
and
quiet
,
and
steady
:
 
liking
nothing
better
than
to
spend
our
Easter
,
and
all
our
other
holidays
,
in
some
quiet
nook
,
with
people
of
whom
we
shall
never
tire
;
but
we
think
we
still
remember
something
of
Greenwich
Fair
,
and
of
those
who
resort
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
we
will
try
.
   
<EOS>
The
road
to
Greenwich
during
the
whole
of
Easter
Monday
,
is
in
a
state
of
perpetual
bustle
and
noise

what

but
what
the

roll
along
at
their
utmost

the

flies
in
clouds
,
ginger

go

the

every

penny
toys

turnpike

are
in
despair

horses

and
wheels
will
come
off

ladies
in
"

scream
with
fright
at
every
fresh
concussion

and
their
admirers
find
it
necessary
to
sit
remarkably
close
to
them

by
way
of
encouragement
;
servants

of

all

work
,
who
are
not
allowed
to
have
followers
,
and
have
got
a
holiday
for
the
day
,
make
the
most
of
their
time
with
the
faithful
admirer
who
waits
for
a
stolen
interview
at
the
corner
of
the
street
every
night
,
when
they
go
to
fetch
the
beer
---
apprentices
grow
sentimental
,
and
straw

bonnet

<EOS>
Everybody
is
anxious
to
get
on
,
and
actuated
by
the
common
wish
to
be
at
the
fair
,
or
in
the
park
,
as
soon
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
Pedestrians
linger
in
groups
at
the
roadside
,
unable
to
resist
the
allurements
of
the
stout
proprietress
of
the
"
Jack

in

the

box
,
three
shies
a

or
the
more
splendid
offers
of
the
man
with
three
thimbles
and
a
pea
on
a
little
round
board
,
who
astonishes
the
bewildered
crowd
with
some
such
address
as

Here
some
greenhorn
whispers
his
friend
that
he
distinctly
saw
the
pea
roll
under
the
middle
thimble
---
<EOS>
an
impression
which
is
immediately
confirmed
by
a
gentleman
in
top

boots
,
who
is
standing
by
,
and
who
,
in
a
low
tone
,
regrets
his
own
inability
to
bet
,
in
consequence
of
having
unfortunately
left
his
purse
at

strongly
urges
the

not

such

The

consoles

and
the
eloquent
harangue
,
with
such
variations
as
the
speaker

exuberant
fancy
suggests

is
again
repeated
to
the
gaping
crowd

reinforced
by

The
chief
place
of
resort
in
the
daytime
,
after
the
public
-
houses
,
is
the
park
,
in
which
the
principal
amusement
is
to
drag
young
ladies
up
the
steep
hill
which
leads
to
the
Observatory
,
and
then
drag
them
down
again

Here

you
will
see
a

burnt

"
telling

prophesying
husbands
,
which
it
requires
no
extraordinary
observation
to
describe
,
for
the
originals
are
before
her

Thereupon
,
the
lady
concerned
laughs
and
blushes
,
and
ultimately
buries
her
face
in
an
imitation
cambric
handkerchief
,
and
the
gentleman
described
looks
extremely
foolish

and
squeezes
her
hand

fees
the
gipsy

the
gipsy
goes
away

perfectly

her
perfectly

it

dark

the

The

The

boisterous

is

calm

quiet

noble

glistening

Five
minutes
'
walking
brings
you
to
the
fair
;
a
scene
calculated
to
awaken
very
different
feelings

<EOS>
The
entrance
is
occupied
on
either
side
by
the
vendors
of
gingerbread

toys

<EOS>
the
stalls
are
gaily
lighted
up

the
most
attractive

profusely
disposed

unbonneted
young

in
their
zeal

seize
you

the

tied
up
in

Occasionally
you
pass
a
deal
table
,
on
which
are
exposed
pen'orths
of
pickled

,
in
little

floating
in
a
somewhat
bilious

looking
green

Cigars

too

are
in
great

add

the

with
three

all
playing
different
tunes
at
the

the
hallooing

an
occasional

may
be
all
very
well

but
these
are
the
people
for
the
reflective
portion
of
the
community

<EOS>
They
look
so
noble
in
those
Roman
dresses
,
with
their
yellow
legs
and
arms
,
long
black
curly
heads
,
bushy
eyebrows

and
scowl
expressive

assassination

solemn

Then
,
the
ladies

were
there
ever
such
innocent

awful

looking
beings
;
as
they
walk
up

down
the
platform
in
twos

threes

with
their
arms
round
each
other

waists
,
or
leaning
for
support

one

those
majestic

<EOS>
Their
spangled
muslin
dresses
and
blue
satin
shoes
and
sandals
(
a
LEETLE

worse

are
the
admiration

all
beholders

the
playful
manner
in

"

reels

"
All

shouts
the
manager
,
when
no
more
people
can
be
induced
to
"
come

"
and
away
rush
the
leading
members
of
the
company
to
do
the
dreadful
in
the
first
piece
.
   
<EOS>
A
change
of
performance
takes
place
every
day
during
the
fair
,
but
the
story
of
the
tragedy
is
always
pretty
much
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
rightful
heir
,
who
loves
a
young
lady
,
and
is
beloved
by
her
;
and
a
wrongful
heir
,
who
loves
her
too
,
and
is
n't
beloved
by
her
;
and
the
wrongful
heir
gets
hold
of
the
rightful
heir
,
and
throws
him
into
a
dungeon
,
just
to
kill
him
off
when
convenient
,
for
which
purpose
he
hires
a
couple
of
assassins
---
a
good
one
and
a
bad
one
---
who
,
the
moment
they
are
left
alone
,
get
up
a
little
murder
on
their
own
account
,
the
good
one
killing
the
bad
one
,
and
the
bad
one
wounding
the
good
one
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
rightful
heir
is
discovered
in
prison
,
carefully
holding
a
long
chain
in
his
hands
,
and
seated
despondingly
in
a
large
arm
-
chair
;
and
the
young
lady
comes
in
to
two
bars
of
soft
music
,
and
embraces
the
rightful
heir
;
and
then
the
wrongful
heir
comes
in
to
two
bars
of
quick
music
(
technically
called
"
a
hurry
"
)
,
and
goes
on
in
the
most
shocking
manner
,
throwing
the
young
lady
about
as
if
she
was
nobody
,
and
calling
the
rightful
heir
"
Ar
-
recreant
---
ar
-
wretch
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
a
very
loud
voice
,
which
answers
the
double
purpose
of
displaying
his
passion
,
and
preventing
the
sound
being
deadened
by
the
sawdust
.
 
<EOS>
The
interest
becomes
intense
;
the
wrongful
heir
draws
his
sword
,
and
rushes
on
the
rightful
heir
;
a
blue
smoke
is
seen
,
a
gong
is
heard
,
and
a
tall
white
figure
(
who
has
been
all
this
time
,
behind
the
arm
-
chair
,
covered
over
with
a
table
-
cloth
)
,
slowly
rises
to
the
tune
of
"
Oft
in
the
stilly
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
is
no
other
than
the
ghost
of
the
rightful
heir
's
father
,
who
was
killed
by
the
wrongful
heir
's
father
,
at
sight
of
which
the
wrongful
heir
becomes
apoplectic
,
and
is
literally
"
struck
all
of
a
heap
,
"
the
stage
not
being
large
enough
to
admit
of
his
falling
down
at
full
length
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
good
assassin
staggers
in
,
and
says
he
was
hired
in
conjunction
with
the
bad
assassin
,
by
the
wrongful
heir
,
to
kill
the
rightful
heir
;
and
he
's
killed
a
good
many
people
in
his
time
,
but
he
's
very
sorry
for
it
,
and
wo
n't
do
so
any
more
---
a
promise
which
he
immediately
redeems
,
by
dying
off
hand
without
any
nonsense
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
rightful
heir
throws
down
his
chain
;
and
then
two
men
,
a
sailor
,
and
a
young
woman
(
the
tenantry
of
the
rightful
heir
)
come
in
,
and
the
ghost
makes
dumb
motions
to
them
,
which
they
,
by
supernatural
interference
,
understand
---
for
no
one
else
can
;
and
the
ghost
(
who
ca
n't
do
anything
without
blue
fire
)
blesses
the
rightful
heir
and
the
young
lady
,
by
half
suffocating
them
with
smoke
:
 
and
then
a
muffin
-
bell
rings
,
and
the
curtain
drops
.
   
<EOS>
The
exhibitions
next
in
popularity
to
these
itinerant
theatres
are
the
travelling
menageries
,
or
,
to
speak
more
intelligibly
,
the
"
Wild

beast
shows
,
"
where
a
military
band
in
beef
-
eater
's
costume
,
with
leopard
-
skin
caps
,
play
incessantly
;
and
where
large
highly

coloured
representations
of
tigers
tearing
men
's
heads
open
,
and
a
lion
being
burnt
with
red
-
hot
irons
to
induce
him
to
drop
his
victim
,
are
hung
up
outside
,
by
way
of
attracting
visitors
.
   
<EOS>
The
principal
officer
at
these
places
is
generally
a
very
tall
,
hoarse
man
,
in
a
scarlet
coat
,
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
,
with
which
he
occasionally
raps
the
pictures
we
have
just
noticed
,
by
way
of
illustrating
his
description
---
something

No

account
recollect

the
price

only
sixpence

"
 
<EOS>
This
address
never
fails
to
produce
a
considerable
sensation
,
and
sixpences
flow
into
the
treasury
with
wonderful
rapidity

<EOS>
The
dwarfs
are
also
objects
of
great
curiosity
,
and
as
a
dwarf
,
a
giantess
,
a
living
skeleton
,
a
wild
Indian
,
"
a
young
lady
of
singular
beauty
,
with
perfectly
white
hair
and
pink
eyes
,
"
and
two
or
three
other
natural
curiosities
,
are
usually
exhibited
together
for
the
small
charge
of
a
penny
,
they
attract
very
numerous
audiences
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
thing
about
a
dwarf
is
,
that
he
has
always
a
little
box
,
about
two
feet
six
inches
high
,
into
which
,
by
long
practice
,
he
can
just
manage
to
get
,
by
doubling
himself
up
like
a
boot
-
jack
;
this
box
is
painted
outside
like
a
six
-
roomed
house
,
and
as
the
crowd
see
him
ring
a
bell
,
or
fire
a
pistol
out
of
the
first
-
floor
window
,
they
verily
believe
that
it
is
his
ordinary
town
residence
,
divided
like
other
mansions
into
drawing

rooms
,
dining
-
parlour
,
and
bedchambers

<EOS>
Shut
up
in
this
case
,
the
unfortunate
little
object
is
brought
out
to
delight
the
throng
by
holding
a
facetious
dialogue
with
the
proprietor
:
 
in
the
course
of
which
,
the
dwarf
(
who
is
always
particularly
drunk
)
pledges
himself
to
sing
a
comic

As

is
not
so
easily
moved
,
a
pair
of
indescribables
of
most
capacious
dimensions
,
and
a
huge
shoe

are
usually
brought
out
,
into
which
two
or
three
stout
men
get
all
at
once
,
to
the
enthusiastic
delight
of
the
crowd
,
who
are
quite
satisfied
with
the
solemn
assurance
that
these
habiliments
form
part
of
the
giant

everyday
costume

The

however

"
The

long
,
the

Immediately
on
your

enter

after

There
is
a
raised
orchestra
,
and
the
place
is
boarded
all
the
way
down
,
in
patches
,
just
wide
enough
for
a
country
dance

<EOS>
There
is
no
master
of
the
ceremonies
in
this
artificial
Eden
---
all
is
primitive
,
unreserved
,
and
unstudied
.
 
<EOS>
The
dust
is
blinding
,
the
heat
insupportable
,
the
company
somewhat
noisy
,
and
in
the
highest
spirits
possible
:
 
<EOS>
the
ladies
,
in
the
height
of
their
innocent
animation
,
dancing
in
the
gentlemen
's
hats
,
and
the
gentlemen
promenading
"
the
gay
and
festive
scene
"
in

or
with
the
more
expensive
ornaments
of
false

low

looking

:
 
playing
children

drums
,
and
accompanied
by
ladies
on
the
penny
trumpet
.
   
<EOS>
The
noise
of
these
various
instruments
,
the
orchestra
,
the
shouting
,
the
"
scratchers
,
"
and
the
dancing
,
is
perfectly
bewildering
.
 
<EOS>
The
dancing
,
itself
,
beggars
description
---
every
figure
lasts
about
an
hour
,
and
the
ladies
bounce
up
and
down
the
middle
,
with
a
degree
of
spirit
which
is
quite
indescribable
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
gentlemen
,
they
stamp
their
feet
against
the
ground
,
every
time
"
hands
four

begins
,
go
down
the
middle
and
up
again
,
with
cigars
in
their
mouths

and
silk
handkerchiefs
in
their
hands
,
and
whirl
their
partners
round
,
nothing
loth
,
scrambling

falling
,
and
embracing

and
knocking
up
against
the
other
couples
,
until
they
are
fairly
tired
out
,
and
can
move
no

<EOS>
The
same
scene
is
repeated
again
and
again
(
slightly
varied
by
an
occasional
"
row
"
)
until
a
late
hour
at
night
:
 
and
a
great
many
clerks

find
themselves
next

or
the

room
(
where

such
are
the

extracted

their
lamentable

This
they
do
,
in
proportion
to
the
scope
afforded
by
the
character
for
the
display
of
their
imbecility
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
the
Duke
of
Glo'ster
is
well
worth
two
pounds
,
because
he
has
it
all
to
himself
;
he
must
wear
a
real
sword
,
and
what
is
better
still
,
he
must
draw
it
,
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
piece
.
 
<EOS>
The
soliloquies
alone
are
well
worth
fifteen
shillings
;
then
there
is
the
stabbing
King
Henry
---
decidedly
cheap
at
three
-
and
-
sixpence
,
that
's
eighteen
-
and

sixpence
;
bullying
the
coffin
-
bearers
---
say
eighteen
-
pence
,
though
it
's
worth
much
more
---
that
's
a
pound
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
love
scene
with
Lady
Ann
,
and
the
bustle
of
the
fourth
act
ca
n't
be
dear
at
ten
shillings
more
<EOS>
---
that
's
only
one
pound
ten
,
including
the
"
off
with
his
head

"
<EOS>
---
which
is
sure
to
bring
down
the
applause
,
and
it
is
very

Lay
the

uck
;

get
yourself
gradually
into
a
corner
,
and
work
with
your
right
hand
,
while
you
're
saying
it
,
as
if
you
were
feeling
your
way
,
and
it
's
sure
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
The
tent
scene
is
confessedly
worth
half
-
a
-
sovereign
,
and
so
you
have
the
fight
in
,
gratis
,
and
everybody
knows
what
an
effect
may
be
produced
by
a
good
combat
.
 
<EOS>
One

<EOS>
then
dodge

slide

then
fall
down
on
one
knee
;
then
fight
upon
it
,
and
then
get
up
again
and
stagger
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
keep
on
doing
this
,
as
long
as
it
seems
to
take
---
say
ten
minutes

and
then
fall
down
(
backwards
,
if
you
can
manage
it
without
hurting
yourself

,
and
die
game
:
 
<EOS>
nothing
like
it
for
producing
an

<EOS>
They
always
do
it
at
Astley

and
Sadler

Wells
,
and
if
they
do
n't
know
how
to
do
this
sort
of

,
who
in
the
world
does
?
 
<EOS>
A
small
child
,
or
a
female
in
white
,
increases
the
interest
of
a
combat
materially
---
indeed
,
we
are
not
aware
that
a
regular
legitimate
terrific
broadsword
combat
could
be
done
without
;
but
it
would
be
rather
difficult
,
and
somewhat
unusual
,
to
introduce
this
effect
in
the
last
scene
of
Richard
the
Third
,
so
the
only
thing
to
be
done
,
is
,
just
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
bargain
,
and
be
as
long
as
possible
fighting
it
out
.

The

the
wicks
of
the
six
little
oil
lamps
round
the
only
tier
of
boxes
,
are
being
turned
up
,
and
the
additional
light
thus
afforded
serves
to
show
the
presence
of
dirt
,
and
absence
of
paint
,
which
forms
a
prominent
feature
in
the
audience
part

As
these

announce

speedy
commencement

let
us
take
a
peep
"
behind

previous
to
the

up

<EOS>
The
little
narrow
passages
beneath
the
stage
are
neither
especially
clean
nor
too
brilliantly
lighted
;
and
the
absence
of
any
flooring
,
together
with
the
damp
mildewy
smell
which
pervades
the
place
,
does
not
conduce
in

great
degree

This

placed

is
the

<EOS>
the

MACBETH
of
the

she
is
always
selected
to
play
the

because
she
is
tall

stout

LOOKS
a

just
to
accustom
himself

He
will
get
on
better
by
degrees

he
will
play
OTHELLO

in

will
very

be
apprehended
on

is
having
his

is
DUNCAN

King

two
dirty

with
the

Vauxhall
-
Gardens
by
day
There
was
a
time
when
if
a
man
ventured
to
wonder
how
Vauxhall
-
gardens
would
look
by
day
,
he
was
hailed
with
a
shout
of
derision
at
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
Vauxhall
by
daylight
!
 
<EOS>
A
porter
-
pot
without
porter
,
the
House
of
Commons
without
the
Speaker
,
a
gas
-
lamp
without
the
gas
---
pooh
,
nonsense
,
the
thing
was
not
to
be
thought
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
rumoured
,
too
,
in
those
times
,
that
Vauxhall
-
gardens
by
day
,
were
the
scene
of
secret
and
hidden
experiments
;
that
there
,
carvers
were
exercised
in
the
mystic
art
of
cutting
a
moderate
-
sized
ham
into
slices
thin
enough
to
pave
the
whole
of
the
grounds
;
that
beneath
the
shade
of
the
tall
trees
,
studious
men
were
constantly
engaged
in
chemical
experiments
,
with
the
view
of
discovering
how
much
water
a
bowl
of
negus
could
possibly
bear
;
and
that
in
some
retired
nooks
,
appropriated
to
the
study
of
ornithology
,
other
sage
and
learned
men
were
,
by
a
process
known
only
to
themselves
,
incessantly
employed
in
reducing
fowls
to
a
mere
combination
of
skin
and
bone
.
   
<EOS>
Vague
rumours
of
this
kind
,
together
with
many
others
of
a
similar
nature
,
cast
over
Vauxhall
-
gardens
an
air
of
deep
mystery
;
and
as
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
mysterious
,
there
is
no
doubt
that
to
a
good
many
people
,
at
all
events
,
the
pleasure
they
afforded
was
not
a
little
enhanced
by
this
very
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
Of
this
class
of
people
we
confess
to
having
made
one
.
 
<EOS>
We
loved
to
wander
among
these
illuminated
groves
,
thinking
of
the
patient
and
laborious
researches
which
had
been
carried
on
there
during
the
day
,
and
witnessing
their
results
in
the
suppers
which
were
served
up
beneath
the
light
of
lamps
and
to
the
sound
of
music
at
night
.
<EOS>
The
temples
and
saloons
and
cosmoramas
and
fountains
glittered
and
sparkled
before
our
eyes
;
the
beauty
of
the
lady
singers
and
the
elegant
deportment
of
the
gentlemen
,
captivated
our
hearts
;
a
few
hundred
thousand
of
additional
lamps
dazzled
our
senses
;
a
bowl
or
two
of
punch
bewildered
our
brains
;
and
we
were
happy
.
   
<EOS>
In
an
evil
hour
,
the
proprietors
of
Vauxhall
-
gardens
took
to
opening
them
by
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
regretted
this
,
as
rudely
and
harshly
disturbing
that
veil
of
mystery
which
had
hung
about
the
property
for
many
years
,
and
which
none
but
the
noonday
sun
,
and
the
late
Mr
Simpson
,
had
ever
penetrated
.
 
<EOS>
We
shrunk
from
going
;
at
this
moment
we
scarcely
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
a
morbid
consciousness
of
approaching
disappointment
---
perhaps
a
fatal
presentiment
---
perhaps
the
weather
;
whatever
it
was
,
we
did
NOT
go
until
the
second
or
third
announcement
of
a
race
between
two
balloons
tempted
us
,
and
we
went
.
   
<EOS>
We
paid
our
shilling
at
the
gate
,
and
then
we
saw
for
the
first
time
,
<EOS>
that
the
entrance
,
if
there
had
been
any
magic
about
it
at
all
,
was
now
decidedly
disenchanted
,
being
,
in
fact
,
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
combination
of
very
roughly
-
painted
boards
and
sawdust
.
 
<EOS>
We
glanced
at
the
orchestra
and
supper
-
room
as
we
hurried
past
---
we
just
recognised
them
,
and
that
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
bent
our
steps
to
the
firework
-
ground
;
there
,
at
least
,
we
should
not
be
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
We
reached
it
,
and
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
with
mortification
and
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
THAT
the
Moorish
tower
---
that
wooden
shed
with
a
door
in
the
centre
,
and
daubs
of
crimson
and
yellow
<EOS>
all
round
,
like
a
gigantic
watch
-
case
!
 
<EOS>
THAT
<EOS>
the
place
where
night
after
night
we
had
beheld
the
undaunted
Mr
Blackmore
make
his
terrific
ascent
,
surrounded
by
flames
of
fire
,
and
peals
of
artillery
,
and
where
the
white
garments
of
Madame
Somebody
(
we
forget
even
her
name
now
)
,
who
nobly
devoted
her
life
to
the
manufacture
of
fireworks
,
had
so
often
been
seen
fluttering
in
the
wind
,
as
she
called
up
a
red
,
blue
,
or
party
-
coloured
light
to
illumine
her
temple
!
 
<EOS>
THAT
<EOS>
the
---
but
at
this
moment
the
bell
rung
;
the
people
scampered
away
,
pell
-
mell
,
to
the
spot
from
whence
the
sound
proceeded
;
and
we
,
from
the
mere
force
of
habit
,
found
ourself
running
among
the
first
,
as
if
for
very
life
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
for
the
concert
in
the
orchestra
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
party
of
dismal
men
in
cocked
hats
were
"
executing
"
the
overture
to
TANCREDI
,
and
a
numerous
assemblage
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
with
their
families
,
had
rushed
from
their
half
-
emptied
stout
mugs
in
the
supper
boxes
,
and
crowded
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Intense
was
the
low
murmur
of
admiration
when
a
particularly
small
gentleman
,
in
a
dress
coat
,
led
on
a
particularly
tall
lady
in
a
blue
sarcenet
pelisse
and
bonnet
of
the
same
,
ornamented
with
large
white
feathers
,
and
forthwith
commenced
a
plaintive
duet
.
   
<EOS>
We
knew
<EOS>
the
small
gentleman
well
;
we
had
seen
a
lithographed
semblance
of
him
,
on
many
a
piece
of
music
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
as
if
in
the
act
of
singing
;
a
wine
-
glass
in
his
hand
;
and
a
table
with
two
decanters
and
four
pine
-
apples
on
it
in
the
background
.
 
<EOS>
The
tall
lady
,
too
,
we
had
gazed
on
,
lost
in
raptures
of
admiration
,
many
and
many
a
time
<EOS>
---
how
different
people
DO
look
by
daylight
,
and
without
punch
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
duet
:
 
<EOS>
first
the
small
gentleman
asked
a
question
,
and
then
the
tall
lady
answered
it
;
then
the
small
gentleman
and
the
tall
lady
sang
together
most
melodiously
;
then
the
small
gentleman
went
through
a
little
piece
of
vehemence
by
himself
,
and
got
very
tenor
indeed
,
in
the
excitement
of
his
feelings
,
to
which
the
tall
lady
responded
in
a
similar
manner
;
then
the
small
gentleman
had
a
shake
or
two
,
after
which
the
tall
lady
had
the
same
,
and
then
they
both
merged
imperceptibly
into
the
original
air
:
 
and
the
band
wound
themselves
up
to
a
pitch
of
fury
,
and
the
small
gentleman
handed
the
tall
lady
out
,
and
the
applause
was
rapturous
.
   
<EOS>
The
comic
singer
,
however
,
was
the
especial
favourite
;
we
really
thought
that
a
gentleman
,
with
his
dinner
in
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
who
stood
near
us
,
would
have
fainted
with
excess
of
joy
.
 
<EOS>
A
marvellously
facetious
gentleman
that
comic
singer
is
;
his
distinguishing
characteristics
are
,
a
wig
approaching
to
the
flaxen
,
and
an
aged
countenance
,
and
he
bears
the
name
of
one
of
the
English
counties
,
if
we
recollect
right
.
 
<EOS>
He
sang
a
very
good
song
about
the
seven
ages
,
the
first
half
-
hour
of
which
afforded
the
assembly
the
purest
delight
;
of
the
rest
we
can
make
no
report
,
as
we
did
not
stay
to
hear
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
We
walked
about
,
and
met
with
a
disappointment
at
every
turn
;
our
favourite
views
were
mere
patches
of
paint
;
the
fountain
that
had
sparkled
so
showily
by
lamp
-
light
,
presented
very
much
the
appearance
of
a
water
-
pipe
that
had
burst
;
all
the
ornaments
were
dingy
,
and
all
the
walks
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
spectral
attempt
at
rope
-
dancing
in
the
little
open
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
shone
upon
the
spangled
dresses
of
the
performers
,
and
their
evolutions
were
about
as
inspiriting
and
appropriate
as
a
country
-
dance
in
a
family
vault
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
retraced
our
steps
to
the
firework
-
ground
,
and
mingled
with
the
little
crowd
of
people
who
were
contemplating
Mr
Green
.
   
<EOS>
Some
half
-
dozen
men
were
restraining
the
impetuosity
of
one
of
the
balloons
,
which
was
completely
filled
,
and
had
the
car
already
attached
;
and
as
rumours
had
gone
abroad
that
a
Lord
was
"
going
up
,
"
the
crowd
were
more
than
usually
anxious
and
talkative
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
little
man
in
faded
black
,
with
a
dirty
face
and
a
rusty
black
neckerchief
with
a
red
border
,
tied
in
a
narrow
wisp
<EOS>
round
his
neck
,
who
entered
into
conversation
with
everybody
,
and
had
something
to
say
upon
every
remark
that
was
made
within
his
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
standing
with
his
arms
folded
,
staring
up
at
the
balloon
,
and
every
now
and
then
vented
his
feelings
of
reverence
for
the
aeronaut
,
by
saying
,
as
he
looked
round
to
catch
somebody
's
eye
,
"
He
's
a
rum
'
un
is
Green
;
think
o
'
<EOS>
this
here
being
up'ards
of
his
two
hundredth
ascent
<EOS>
;
ecod
,
the
man
as
is
ekal
to
Green
never
had
the
toothache
yet
,
nor
wo
n't
have
within
this
hundred
year
,
and
that
's
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
meets
with
real
talent
,
and
native
,
too
,
encourage
it
<EOS>
,
that
's
what
I
say
;
"
and
when
he
had
delivered
himself
to
this
effect
,
he
would
fold
his
arms
with
more
determination
than
ever
,
and
stare
at
the
balloon
with
a
sort
of
admiring
defiance
of
any
other
man
alive
,
beyond
himself
and
Green
,
that
impressed
the
crowd
with
the
opinion
that
he
was
an
oracle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
're
very
right
,
sir
,
"
said
another
gentleman
,
with
his
wife
,
and
children
,
and
mother
,
and
wife
's
sister
,
and
a
host
of
female
friends
,
in
all
the
gentility
of
white
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
frills
,
and
spencers
,
"
Mr
Green
is
a
steady
hand
,
sir
,
and
there
's
no
fear
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fear
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
little
man
:
 
<EOS>
"
is
n't
it
a
lovely
thing
to
see
him
and
his
wife
a
going
up
in
one
balloon
,
and
his
own
son
and
HIS
wife
a
jostling
up
against
them
in
another
,
and
all
of
them
going
twenty
or
thirty
mile
in
three
hours
or
so
,
and
then
coming
back
in
pochayses
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
where
this
here
science
is
to
stop
,
mind
you
;
that
's
what
bothers
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
there
was
a
considerable
talking
among
the
females
in
the
spencers
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
ladies
a
laughing
at
,
sir
?
"
inquired
the
little
man
,
condescendingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
my
sister
Mary
,
"
said
one
of
the
girls
,
"
as
says
she
hopes
his
lordship
wo
n't
be
frightened
when
he
's
in
the
car
,
and
want
to
come
out
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Make
yourself
easy
about
that
there
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
was
so
much
as
to
move
a
inch
without
leave
,
Green
would
jist
fetch
him
a
crack
over
the
head
with
the
telescope
,
as
would
send
him
into
the
bottom
of
the
basket
in
no
time
,
and
stun
him
till
they
come
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
he
,
though
?
"
inquired
the
other
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
would
he
,
"
replied
the
little
one
,
"
and
think
nothing
of
it
,
neither
,
if
he
was
the
king
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Green
's
presence
of
mind
is
wonderful
.
"
   
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
all
eyes
were
directed
to
the
preparations
which
were
being
made
for
starting
.
 
<EOS>
The
car
was
attached
to
the
second
balloon
,
the
two
were
brought
pretty
close
together
,
and
a
military
band
commenced
playing
,
with
a
zeal
and
fervour
which
would
render
the
most
timid
man
in
existence
but
too
happy
to
accept
any
means
of
quitting
that
particular
spot
of
earth
on
which
they
were
stationed
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Green
,
sen
.
,
and
his
noble
companion
entered
one
car
,
and
Mr
Green
,
jun
.
,
and
HIS
companion
the
other
;
and
then
the
balloons
went
up
,
and
the
aerial
travellers
stood
up
,
and
the
crowd
outside
roared
with
delight
,
and
the
two
gentlemen
who
had
never
ascended
before
,
tried
to
wave
their
flags
,
as
if
they
were
not
nervous
,
but
held
on
very
fast
all
the
while
;
and
the
balloons
were
wafted
gently
away
,
our
little
friend
solemnly
protesting
,
long
after
they
were
reduced
to
mere
specks
in
the
air
,
that
he
could
still
distinguish
the
white
hat
of
Mr
Green
.
 
<EOS>
The
gardens
disgorged
their
multitudes
,
boys
ran
up
and
down
screaming
"
bal
-
loon
;
"
and
in
all
the
crowded
thoroughfares
people
rushed
out
of
their
shops
into
the
middle
of
the
road
,
and
having
stared
up
in
the
air
at
two
little
black
objects
till
they
almost
dislocated
their
necks
,
walked
slowly
in
again
,
perfectly
satisfied
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
day
there
was
a
grand
account
of
the
ascent
in
the
morning
papers
,
and
the
public
were
informed
how
it
was
the
finest
day
but
four
in
Mr
Green
's
remembrance
;
how
they
retained
sight
of
the
earth
till
they
lost
it
behind
the
clouds
;
and
how
the
reflection
of
the
balloon
on
the
undulating
masses
of
vapour
was
gorgeously
picturesque
;
together
with
a
little
science
about
the
refraction
of
the
sun
's
rays
,
and
some
mysterious
hints
respecting
atmospheric
heat
and
eddying
currents
of
air
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
also
an
interesting
account
how
a
man
in
a
boat
was
distinctly
heard
by
Mr
Green
,
jun
.
,
to
exclaim
,
"
My
eye
!
"
<EOS>
which
Mr
Green
,
jun
.
,
attributed
to
his
voice
rising
to
the
balloon
,
and
the
sound
being
thrown
back
from
its
surface
into
the
car
;
and
the
whole
concluded
with
a
slight
allusion
to
another
ascent
next
Wednesday
,
all
of
which
was
very
instructive
and
very
amusing
,
as
our
readers
will
see
if
they
look
to
the
papers
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
have
forgotten
to
mention
the
date
,
they
have
only
to
wait
till
next
summer
,
and
take
the
account
of
the
first
ascent
,
and
it
will
answer
the
purpose
equally
well
.
   
<EOS>
Early
coaches
<EOS>
We
have
often
wondered
how
many
months
'
incessant
travelling
in
a
post
-
chaise
it
would
take
to
kill
a
man
;
and
wondering
by
analogy
,
we
should
very
much
like
to
know
how
many
months
of
constant
travelling
in
a
succession
of
early
coaches
,
an
unfortunate
mortal
could
endure
.
 
<EOS>
Breaking
a
man
alive
upon
the
wheel
,
would
be
nothing
to
breaking
his
rest
,
his
peace
,
his
heart
---
everything
but
<EOS>
his
fast
---
upon
four
;
and
the
punishment
of
Ixion
(
the
only
practical
person
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
who
has
discovered
the
secret
of
the
perpetual
motion
)
would
sink
into
utter
insignificance
before
the
one
we
have
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
had
been
a
powerful
churchman
in
those
good
times
when
blood
was
shed
as
freely
as
water
,
and
men
were
mowed
down
like
grass
,
in
the
sacred
cause
of
religion
,
we
would
have
lain
by
very
quietly
till
we
got
hold
of
some
especially
obstinate
miscreant
,
who
positively
refused
to
be
converted
to
our
faith
,
and
then
we
would
have
booked
him
for
an
inside
place
in
a
small
coach
,
which
travelled
day
and
night
:
 
and
securing
the
remainder
of
the
places
for
stout
men
with
a
slight
tendency
to
coughing
and
spitting
,
we
would
have
started
him
forth
on
his
last
travels
:
 
leaving
him
mercilessly
to
all
the
tortures
which
the
waiters
,
landlords
,
coachmen
,
guards
,
boots
,
chambermaids
,
and
other
familiars
on
his
line
of
road
,
might
think
proper
to
inflict
.
   
<EOS>
Who
has
not
experienced
the
miseries
inevitably
consequent
upon
a
summons
to
undertake
a
hasty
journey
?
 
<EOS>
You
receive
an
intimation
from
your
place
of
business
---
wherever
that
may
be
,
or
whatever
you
may
be
---
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
leave
town
without
delay
.
<EOS>
You
and
your
family
are
forthwith
thrown
into
a
state
of
tremendous
excitement
;
an
express
is
immediately
dispatched
to
the
washerwoman
's
;
everybody
is
in
a
bustle
;
and
you
,
yourself
,
with
a
feeling
of
dignity
which
you
can
not
altogether
conceal
,
sally
forth
to
the
booking
-
office
to
secure
your
place
.
 
<EOS>
Here
a
painful
consciousness
of
your
own
unimportance
first
rushes
on
your
mind
---
the
people
are
as
cool
and
collected
as
if
nobody
were
going
out
of
town
,
or
as
if
a
journey
of
a
hundred
odd
miles
were
a
mere
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
You
enter
a
mouldy
-
looking
room
,
ornamented
with
large
posting
-
bills
;
the
greater
part
of
the
place
enclosed
behind
a
huge
,
lumbering
,
rough
counter
,
and
fitted
up
with
recesses
that
look
like
the
dens
of
the
smaller
animals
in
a
travelling
menagerie
,
without
the
bars
.
 
<EOS>
Some
half
-
dozen
people
are
"
booking
"
brown
-
paper
parcels
,
which
one
of
the
clerks
flings
into
the
aforesaid
recesses
with
an
air
of
recklessness
which
you
,
remembering
the
new
carpet
-
bag
you
bought
in
the
morning
,
feel
considerably
annoyed
at
;
porters
,
looking
like
so
many
Atlases
,
keep
rushing
in
and
out
,
with
large
packages
on
their
shoulders
;
and
while
you
are
waiting
to
make
the
necessary
inquiries
,
you
wonder
what
on
earth
the
booking
-
office
clerks
can
have
been
before
they
were
booking
-
office
clerks
;
one
of
them
with
his
pen
behind
his
ear
,
and
his
hands
behind
him
,
is
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
,
like
a
full
-
length
portrait
of
Napoleon
;
the
other
with
his
hat
half
off
his
head
,
enters
the
passengers
'
names
in
the
books
with
a
coolness
which
is
inexpressibly
provoking
;
and
the
villain
whistles
---
actually
whistles
---
while
a
man
asks
him
what
the
fare
is
outside
,
all
the
way
to
Holyhead
!
<EOS>
---
in
frosty
weather
,
too
!
<EOS>
They
are
clearly
an
isolated
race
,
evidently
possessing
no
sympathies
or
feelings
in
common
with
the
rest
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
Your
turn
comes
at
last
,
and
having
paid
the
fare
,
you
tremblingly
inquire
---
<EOS>
"
What
time
will
it
be
necessary
for
me
to
be
here
in
the
morning
?
"
---
"
Six
o'clock
,
"
replies
the
whistler
,
carelessly
pitching
the
sovereign
you
have
just
parted
with
,
into
a
wooden
bowl
on
the
desk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rather
before
than
arter
,
"
adds
the
man
with
the
semi
-
roasted
unmentionables
,
with
just
as
much
ease
and
complacency
as
if
the
whole
world
got
out
of
bed
at
five
.
 
<EOS>
You
turn
into
the
street
,
ruminating
as
you
bend
your
steps
homewards
on
the
extent
to
which
men
become
hardened
in
cruelty
,
by
custom
.
   
<EOS>
If
there
be
one
thing
in
existence
more
miserable
than
another
,
it
most
unquestionably
is
the
being
compelled
to
rise
by
candlelight
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
ever
doubted
the
fact
,
you
are
painfully
convinced
of
your
error
,
on
the
morning
of
your
departure
.
 
<EOS>
You
left
strict
orders
,
overnight
,
to
be
called
at
half
-
past
four
,
and
you
have
done
nothing
all
night
but
doze
for
five
minutes
at
a
time
,
and
start
up
suddenly
from
a
terrific
dream
of
a
large
church
-
clock
with
the
small
hand
running
round
,
with
astonishing
rapidity
,
to
every
figure
on
the
dial
-
plate
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
completely
exhausted
,
you
fall
gradually
into
a
refreshing
sleep
---
your
thoughts
grow
confused
---
the
stage
-
coaches
,
which
have
been
"
going
off
"
before
your
eyes
all
night
,
become
less
and
less
distinct
,
until
they
go
off
altogether
;
one
moment
you
are
driving
with
all
the
skill
and
smartness
of
an
experienced
whip
---
the
next
you
are
exhibiting
\
<EOS>
a
/
FW
la
Ducrow
\
,
on
the
off
-
leader
;
anon
you
are
closely
muffled
up
,
inside
,
and
have
just
recognised
in
the
person
of
the
guard
an
old
schoolfellow
,
whose
funeral
,
even
in
your
dream
,
you
remember
to
have
attended
eighteen
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
you
fall
into
a
state
of
complete
oblivion
,
from
which
you
are
aroused
,
as
if
into
a
new
state
of
existence
,
by
a
singular
illusion
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
apprenticed
to
a
trunk
-
maker
;
how
,
or
why
,
or
when
,
or
wherefore
,
you
do
n't
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
;
but
there
you
are
,
pasting
the
lining
in
the
lid
of
a
portmanteau
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
that
other
apprentice
in
the
back
shop
,
how
he
is
hammering
!
<EOS>
---
rap
,
rap
,
rap
---
<EOS>
what
an
industrious
fellow
he
must
be
!
<EOS>
you
have
heard
him
at
work
for
half
an
hour
past
,
and
he
has
been
hammering
incessantly
the
whole
time
.
<EOS>
Rap
,
rap
,
rap
,
again
---
he
's
talking
now
---
<EOS>
what
's
that
he
said
?
<EOS>
Five
o'clock
!
 
<EOS>
You
make
a
violent
exertion
,
and
start
up
in
bed
.
<EOS>
The
vision
is
at
once
dispelled
;
the
trunk
-
maker
's
shop
is
your
own
bedroom
,
and
the
other
apprentice
your
shivering
servant
,
who
has
been
vainly
endeavouring
to
wake
you
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
the
imminent
risk
of
breaking
either
his
own
knuckles
or
the
panels
of
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
You
proceed
to
dress
yourself
,
with
all
possible
dispatch
.
 
<EOS>
The
flaring
flat
candle
with
the
long
snuff
,
gives
light
enough
to
show
that
the
things
you
want
,
are
not
where
they
ought
to
be
,
and
you
undergo
a
trifling
delay
in
consequence
of
having
carefully
packed
up
one
of
your

You
soon
complete
your
toilet

however
,
for
you
are
not
particular
on
such
an
occasion
,
and
you
shaved
yesterday
evening
;
so
mounting
your
Petersham
great

green
travelling

in

you
walk
lightly

awaken
any

,
and
after
pausing
in

room
for
one

,
just
to
have
a

(
the

sitting

looking
remarkably
comfortable

with
everything
out
of
its
place

strewed
with

you
undo
the

find
yourself
fairly

A

<EOS>
The

You
look
down
the
long
perspective
of
Oxford
-
street
,
the
gas
-
lights
mournfully
reflected
on
the
wet
pavement
,
and
can
discern
no
speck
in
the
road
to
encourage
the
belief
that
there
is
a
cab
or
a
coach
to
be
had
---
the
very
coachmen
have
gone
home
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
The
cold
sleet
is
drizzling
down
with
that
gentle
regularity
,
which
betokens
a
duration
of
four
-
and

twenty
hours
at

;
the
damp
hangs
upon
the

tops

and
clings
to
you
like
an
invisible

The

is
"

in
every

the

have
burst

the

the

horses

policemen
look

a

trudges
slowly
along

the

nobody

It
strikes
a
quarter
past
five
as
you
trudge
down
Waterloo
-
place
on
your
way
to
the
Golden
Cross
,
and
you
discover
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
you
were
called
about
an
hour
too
early
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
time
to
go
back
;
there
is
no
place
open
to
go
into
,
and
you
have
,
therefore
,
no
resource
but
to
go
forward
,
which
you
do
,
feeling
remarkably
satisfied
with
yourself
,
and
everything
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
arrive
at
the
office
,
and
look
wistfully
up
the
yard
for
the
Birmingham
High
-
flier
,
which
,
for
aught
you
can
see
,
may
have
flown
away
altogether
,
for
preparations
appear
to
be
on
foot
for
the
departure
of
any
vehicle
in
the
shape
of
a
coach
.
 
<EOS>
You
wander
into
the
booking
-
office
,
which
with
the
gas
-
lights
and
blazing
fire
,
looks
quite
comfortable
by
contrast
---
that
is
to
say
,
if
any
place
CAN
look
comfortable
at
half
-
past
five
on
a
winter

morning
.
<EOS>
There
stands
the
identical
book
-
keeper
in
the
same
position
as
if
he
had
not
moved
since
you
saw
him
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
informs
you
,
that
the
coach
is
up
the
yard
,
and
will
be
brought
round
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
you
leave
your
bag
,
and
repair
to
"
The
Tap
"
---
not
with
any
absurd
idea
of
warming
yourself
,
because
you
feel
such
a
result
to
be
utterly
hopeless
,
but
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
some
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
which
you
do
,
---
when
the
kettle
boils
!
<EOS>
an
event
which
occurs
exactly
two
minutes
and
a
half
before
the
time
fixed
for
the
starting
of
the
coach
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
stroke
of
six
,
peals
from
St
Martin
's
church
steeple
,
just
as
you
take
the
first
sip
of
the
boiling
liquid

<EOS>
You
find
yourself
at
the

office
in
two
seconds
,
and
the

waiter
finds
himself
much
comforted
by
your
brandy

water
,
in
about
the
same
period

<EOS>
The
coach
is
out
;
the
horses
are
in
,
and
the
guard
and
two
or
three
porters
,
are
stowing
the
luggage
away
,
and
running
up
the
steps
of
the
booking

,
and
down
the

of
the

with
breathless

The
place

which
a

quiet

is
now
all
bustle

the

The

and
the
outsides
,
with
the
exception
of
yourself
,
are
pacing
up
and
down
the
pavement
to
keep
themselves
warm
;
they
consist
of
two
young
men
with
very
long
hair
,
to
which
the
sleet
has
communicated
the
appearance
of
crystallised
rats
'
tails
;
one
thin
young
woman
cold
and
peevish
,
one
old
gentleman
ditto
ditto
,
and
something
in
a
cloak
and
cap
,
intended
to
represent
a
military
officer
;
every
member
of
the

,
with
a
large
stiff

over
his

looking

Pan

<EOS>
"
Take

says
the
coachman
,
who
now
appears
for
the
first
time
,
in
a
rough
blue
great
-
coat
,
of
which
the
buttons
behind
are
so
far
apart

that
you
ca
n't
see
them
both
at

"

cries
the

"
Five

<EOS>
Up
jump
the
passengers
---
the
two
young
men
smoking
like
lime
-
kilns
,
and
the
old
gentleman
grumbling
audibly
.
 
<EOS>
The
thin
young
woman
is
got
upon
the
roof
,
by
dint
of
a
great
deal
of
pulling
,
and
pushing
,
and
helping
and
trouble
,
and
she
repays
it
by
expressing
her
solemn
conviction
that
she
will
never
be
able
to
get
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
All

"
sings
out
the
guard
at
last
,
jumping
up
as
the
coach
starts
,
and
blowing
his
horn
directly
afterwards
,
in
proof
of
the
soundness
of
his
wind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
'em
go
,
Harry
,
give
'em
their
heads
,
"
cries
the
coachman
---
<EOS>
and
off
we
start
as
briskly
as
if
the
morning
were
"
all
right
,
"
as
well
as
the
coach
:
 
and
looking
forward
as
anxiously
to
the
termination
of
our
journey
,
as
we
fear
our
readers
will
have
done
,
long
since
,
to
the
conclusion
of
our
paper
.
   
<EOS>
Omnibuses
<EOS>
It
is
very
generally
allowed
that
public
conveyances
afford
an
extensive
field
for
amusement
and
observation
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
public
conveyances
that
have
been
constructed
since
the
days
of
the
Ark
<EOS>
---
we
think
that
is
the
earliest
on
record
---
to
the
present
time
,
commend
us
to
an
omnibus
.
 
<EOS>
A
long
stage
is
not
to
be
despised
,
but
there
you
have
only
six
insides
,
and
the
chances
are
,
that
the
same
people
go
all
the
way
with
you
---
<EOS>
there
is
no
change
,
no
variety
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
after
the
first
twelve
hours
or
so
,
people
get
cross
and
sleepy
,
and
when
you
have
seen
a
man
in
his
nightcap
,
you
lose
all
respect
for
him
;
at
least
,
that
is
the
case
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
Then
on
smooth
roads
people
frequently
get
prosy
,
and
tell
long
stories
,
and
even
those
who
do
n't
talk
,
may
have
very
unpleasant
predilections
.
 
<EOS>
We
once
travelled
four
hundred
miles
,
inside
a
stage
-
coach
,
with
a
stout
man
,
who
had
a
glass
of
rum
-
and
-
water
,
warm
,
handed
in
at
the
window
at
every
place
where
we
changed
horses
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
decidedly
unpleasant
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
also
travelled
occasionally
,
with
a
small
boy
of
a
pale
aspect
,
with
light
hair
,
and
no
perceptible
neck
,
coming
up
to
town
from
school
under
the
protection
of
the
guard
,
and
directed
to
be
left
at
the
Cross
Keys
till
called
for
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
,
perhaps
,
even
worse
than
rum
-
and
-
water
in
a
close
atmosphere
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
is
the
whole
train
of
evils
consequent
on
a
change
of
the
coachman
;
and
the
misery
of
the
discovery
---
which
the
guard
is
sure
to
make
the
moment
you
begin
to
doze
---
that
he
wants
a
brown
-
paper
parcel
,
which
he
distinctly
remembers
to
have
deposited
under
the
seat
on
which
you
are
reposing
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
bustle
and
groping
takes
place
,
and
when
you
are
thoroughly
awakened
,
and
severely
cramped
,
by
holding
your
legs
up
by
an
almost
supernatural
exertion
,
while
he
is
looking
behind
them
,
it
suddenly
occurs
to
him
that
he
put
it
in
the
fore
-
boot
.
 
<EOS>
Bang
goes
the
door
;
the
parcel
is
immediately
found
;
off
starts
the
coach
again
;
and
the
guard
plays
the
key
-
bugle
as
loud
as
he
can
play
it
,
as
if
in
mockery
of
your
wretchedness
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
you
meet
with
none
of
these
afflictions
in
an
omnibus
;
sameness
there
can
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
passengers
change
as
often
in
the
course
of
one
journey
as
the
figures
in
a
kaleidoscope
,
and
though
not
so
glittering
,
are
far
more
amusing
.
 
<EOS>
We
believe
there
is
no
instance
on
record
,
of
a
man
's
having
gone
to
sleep
in
one
of
these
vehicles
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
long
stories
,
would
any
man
venture
to
tell
a
long
story
in
an
omnibus
?
<EOS>
and
even
if
he
did
,
where
would
be
the
harm
?
<EOS>
nobody
could
possibly
hear
what
he
was
talking
about
.
 
<EOS>
Again
;
children
,
though
occasionally
,
are
not
often
to
be
found
in
an
omnibus
;
and
even
when
they
are
,
if
the
vehicle
be
full
,
as
is
generally
the
case
,
somebody
sits
upon
them
,
and
we
are
unconscious
of
their
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
after
mature
reflection
,
and
considerable
experience
,
we
are
decidedly
of
opinion
,
that
of
all
known
vehicles
,
from
the
glass
-
coach
in
which
we
were
taken
to
be
christened
,
to
that
sombre
caravan
in
which
we
must
one
day
make
our
last
earthly
journey
,
there
is
nothing
like
an
omnibus
.
   
<EOS>
We
will
back
the
machine
in
which
we
make
our
daily
peregrination
from
the
top
of
Oxford
-
street
to
the
city
,
against
any
"
buss
"
on
the
road
,
whether
it
be
for
the
gaudiness
of
its
exterior
,
the
perfect
simplicity
of
its
interior
,
or
the
native
coolness
of
its
cad
.
 
<EOS>
This
young
gentleman
is
a
singular
instance
of
self
-
devotion
;
his
somewhat
intemperate
zeal
on
behalf
of
his
employers
,
is
constantly
getting
him
into
trouble
,
and
occasionally
into
the
house
of
correction
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
no
sooner
emancipated
,
however
,
than
he
resumes
the
duties
of
his
profession
with
unabated
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
His
principal
distinction
is
his
activity
.
 
<EOS>
His
great
boast
is
,
"
that
he
can
chuck
an
old
gen'lm'n
into
the
buss
,
shut
him
in
,
and
rattle
off
,
afore
<EOS>
he
knows
where
it
's
a
-
going
to
"
---
<EOS>
a
feat
which
he
frequently
performs
,
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
every
one
but
the
old
gentleman
concerned
,
who
,
somehow
or
other
,
never
can
see
the
joke
of
the
thing
.
   
<EOS>
We
are
not
aware
that
it
has
ever
been
precisely
ascertained
,
how
many
passengers
our
omnibus
will
contain
.
 
<EOS>
The
impression
on
the
cad
's
mind
evidently
is
,
that
it
is
amply
sufficient
for
the
accommodation
of
any
number
of
persons
that
can
be
enticed
into
it
.
"
<EOS>
Any
room
?
<EOS>
"
cries
a
hot
pedestrian
.
 
<EOS>
"
Plenty
o
'
room
,
sir
,
"
replies
the
conductor
,
gradually
opening
the
door
,
and
not
disclosing
the
real
state
of
the
case
,
until
the
wretched
man
is
on
the
steps
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
?
"
inquires
the
entrapped
individual
,
with
an
attempt
to
back
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Either
side
,
sir
,
"
rejoins
the
cad
,
shoving
him
in
,
and
slamming
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
Bill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Retreat
is
impossible
;
the
new
-
comer
rolls
about
,
till
he
falls
down
somewhere
,
and
there
he
stops
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
get
into
the
city
a
little
before
ten
,
four
or
five
of
our
party
are
regular
passengers
.
 
<EOS>
We
always
take
them
up
at
the
same
places
,
and
they
generally
occupy
the
same
seats
;
they
are
always
dressed
in
the
same
manner
,
and
invariably
discuss
the
same
topics
---
the
increasing
rapidity
of
cabs
,
and
the
disregard
of
moral
obligations
evinced
by
omnibus
men
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
little
testy
old
man
,
with
a
powdered
head
,
who
always
sits
on
the
right
-
hand
side
of
the
door
as
you
enter
,
with
his
hands
folded
on
the
top
of
his
umbrella
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
extremely
impatient
,
and
sits
there
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
a
sharp
eye
on
the
cad
,
with
whom
he
generally
holds
a
running
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
very
officious
in
helping
people
in
and
out
,
and
always
volunteers
to
give
the
cad
a
poke
with
his
umbrella
,
when
any
one
wants
to
alight
.
 
<EOS>
He
usually
recommends
ladies
to
have
sixpence
ready
,
to
prevent
delay
;
and
if
anybody
puts
a
window
down
,
that

<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
are
you
stopping
for
?
"
says
the
little
man
every
morning
,
the
moment
there
is
the
slightest
indication
of
"
pulling
up
"
at
the
corner
of
Regent
-
street
,
when
some
such
dialogue
as
the
following
takes
place
between
him
and
the
cad
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
stopping
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
cad
whistles
,
and
affects
not
to
hear
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
[
a
poke
]
,
what
are
you
stopping
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
For

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
're
stopping
for
passengers
;
but
you
've
no
business
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
WHY
are
you
stopping
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
sir
,
that
's
a
difficult
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
because
we
perfer
stopping
here
to
going
on
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
mind
,
"
exclaims
the
little
old
man
,
with
great
vehemence
,
"
I
'll
pull
you
up
to
-
morrow
;
I
've
often
threatened
to
do
it
;
now
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
"
replies
the
cad
,
touching
his
hat
with
a
mock
expression
of
gratitude
;
<EOS>
---
"
werry
much
obliged
to
you
indeed
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
the
young
men
in
the
omnibus
laugh
very
heartily
,
and
the
old
gentleman
gets
very
red
in
the
face
,
and
seems
highly
exasperated
.
   
<EOS>
The
stout
gentleman
in
the
white
neckcloth
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
vehicle
,
looks
very
prophetic
,
and
says
that
something
must
shortly
be
done
with
these
fellows
,
or
there
's
no
saying
where
all
this
will
end
;
and
the
shabby
-
genteel
man
with
the
green
bag
,
expresses
his
entire
concurrence
in
the
opinion
,
as
he
has
done
regularly
every
morning
for
the
last
six
months
.
   
<EOS>
A
second
omnibus
now
comes
up
,
and
stops
immediately
behind
us
.
<EOS>
Another
old
gentleman
elevates
his
cane
in
the
air
,
and
runs
with
all
his
might
towards
our
omnibus
;
we
watch
his
progress
with
great
interest
;
the
door
is
opened
to
receive
him
,
he
suddenly
disappears
---
he
has
been
spirited
away
by
the
opposition
.
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
<EOS>
the
driver
of
the
opposition
taunts
our
people
with
his
having
"
regularly
done
'em
out
of
that
old
swell
,
"
and
the
voice
of
the
"
old
swell
"
is
heard
,
vainly
protesting
against
this
unlawful
detention
.
 
<EOS>
We
rattle
off
,
the
other
omnibus
rattles
after
us
,
and
every
time
we
stop
to
take
up
a
passenger
,
they
stop
to
take
him
too
;
sometimes
we
get
him
;
sometimes
they
get
him
;
but
whoever
do
n't
get
him
,
say
they
ought
to
have
had
him
,
and
the
cads
of
the
respective
vehicles
abuse
one
another
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
arrive
in
the
vicinity
of
Lincoln's
-
inn
-
fields
,
Bedford
-
row
,
and
other
legal
haunts
,
we
drop
a
great
many
of
our
original
passengers
,
and
take
up
fresh
ones
,
who
meet
with
a
very
sulky
reception
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
rather
remarkable
,
that
the
people
already
in
an
omnibus
,
always
look
at
newcomers
,
as
if
they
entertained
some
undefined
idea
that
they
have
no
business
to
come
in
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
quite
persuaded
the
little
old
man
has
some
notion
of
this
kind
,
and
that
he
considers
their
entry
as
a
sort
of
negative
impertinence
.
   
<EOS>
Conversation
is
now
entirely
dropped
;
each
person
gazes
vacantly
through
the
window
in
front
of
him
,
and
everybody
thinks
that
his
opposite
neighbour
is
staring
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
one
man
gets
out
at
Shoe
-
lane
,
and
another
at
the
corner
of
Farringdon
-
street
,
the
little
old
gentleman
grumbles
,
and
suggests
to
the
latter
,
that
if
he
had
got
out
at
Shoe
-
lane
too
,
he
would
have
saved
them
the
delay
of
another
stoppage
;
whereupon
the
young
men
laugh
again
,
and
the
old
gentleman
looks
very
solemn
,
and
says
nothing
more
till
he
gets
to
the
Bank
,
when
he
trots
off
as
fast
as
he
can
,
leaving
us
to
do
the
same
,
and
to
wish
,
as
we
walk
away
,
that
we
could
impart
to
others
any
portion
of
the
amusement
we
have
gained
for
ourselves
.
   
<EOS>
The
last
cab
-
driver
,
and
the
first
omnibus
cad
Of
all
the
cabriolet
-
drivers
whom
we
have
ever
had
the
honour
and
gratification
of
knowing
by
sight
---
and
our
acquaintance
in
this
way
has
been
most
extensive
---
there
is
one
who
made
an
impression
on
our
mind
which
can
never
be
effaced
,
and
who
awakened
in
our
bosom
a
feeling
of
admiration
and
respect
,
which
we
entertain
a
fatal
presentiment
will
never
be
called
forth
again
by
any
human
being
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
most
simple
and
prepossessing
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
brown
-
whiskered
,
white
-
hatted
,
no
-
coated
cabman
;
his
nose
was
generally
red
,
and
his
bright
blue
eye
not
unfrequently
stood
out
in
bold
relief
against
a
black
border
of
artificial
workmanship
;
his
boots
were
of
the
Wellington
form
,
pulled
up
to
meet
his
corduroy
knee
-
smalls
,
or
at
least
to
approach
as
near
them
as
their
dimensions
would
admit
of
;
and
his
neck
was
usually
garnished
with
a
bright
yellow
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
In
summer
he
carried
in
his
mouth
a
flower
;
in
winter
,
a
straw
---
slight
,
but
,
to
a
contemplative
mind
,
certain
indications
of
a
love
of
nature
,
and
a
taste
for
botany
.
   
<EOS>
His
cabriolet
was
gorgeously
painted
---
a
bright
red
;
and
wherever
we
went
,
City
or
West
End
,
Paddington
or
Holloway
,
North
,
East
,
West
,
or
South
,
there
was
the
red
cab
,
bumping
up
against
the
posts
at
the
street
corners
,
and
turning
in
and
out
,
among
hackney
-
coaches
,
and
drays
,
and
carts
,
and
waggons
,
and
omnibuses
,
and
contriving
by
some
strange
means
or
other
,
to
get
out
of
places
which
no
other
vehicle
but
the
red
cab
could
ever
by
any
possibility
have
contrived
to
get
into
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Our
fondness
for
that
red
cab
was
unbounded
.
 
<EOS>
How
we
should
have
liked
to
have
seen
it
in
the
circle
at
Astley
's
!
 
<EOS>
Our
life
upon
it
,
that
it
should
have
performed
such
evolutions
as
would
have
put
the
whole
company
to
shame
---
Indian
chiefs
,
knights
,
Swiss
peasants
,
and
all
.
   
<EOS>
Some
people
object
to
the
exertion
of
getting
into
cabs
,
and
others
object
to
the
difficulty
of
getting
out
of
them
;
we
think
both
these
are
objections
which
take
their
rise
in
perverse
and
ill
-
conditioned
minds
.
 
<EOS>
The
getting
into
a
cab
is
a
very
pretty
and
graceful
process
,
which
,
when
well
performed
,
is
essentially
melodramatic
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
there
is
the
expressive
pantomime
of
every
one
of
the
eighteen
cabmen
on
the
stand
,
the
moment
you
raise
your
eyes
from
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
is
your
own
pantomime
in
reply
---
quite
a
little
ballet
.
 
<EOS>
Four
cabs
immediately
leave
the
stand
,
for
your
especial
accommodation
;
and
the
evolutions
of
the
animals
who
draw
them
,
are
beautiful
in
the
extreme
,
as
they
grate
the
wheels
of
the
cabs
against
the
curb
-
stones
,
and
sport
playfully
in
the
kennel
.
 
<EOS>
You
single
out
a
particular
cab
,
and
dart
swiftly
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
One
bound
,
and
you
are
on
the
first
step
;
turn
your
body
lightly
round
to
the
right
,
and
you
are
on
the
second
;
bend
gracefully
beneath
the
reins
,
working
round
to
the
left
at
the
same
time
,
and
you
are
in
the
cab
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
seat
:
 
<EOS>
the
apron
knocks
you
comfortably
into
it
at
once
,
and
off
you
go
.
   
<EOS>
The
getting
out
of
a
cab
is
,
perhaps
,
rather
more
complicated
in
its
theory
,
and
a
shade
more
difficult
in
its
execution
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
studied
the
subject
a
great
deal
,
and
we
think
the
best
way
is
,
to
throw
yourself
out
,
and
trust
to
chance
for
alighting
on
your
feet
.
<EOS>
If
you
make
the
driver
alight
first
,
and
then
throw
yourself
upon
him
,
you
will
find
that
he
breaks
your
fall
materially
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
event
of
your
contemplating
an
offer
of
eightpence
,
on
no
account
make
the
tender
,
or
show
the
money
,
until
you
are
safely
on
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
bad
policy
attempting
to
save
the
fourpence
.
<EOS>
You
are
very
much
in
the
power
of
a
cabman
,
and
he
considers
it
a
kind
of
fee
not
to
do
you
any
wilful
damage
.
 
<EOS>
Any
instruction
,
however
,
in
the
art
of
getting
out
of
a
cab
,
is
wholly
unnecessary
if
you
are
going
any
distance
,
because
the
probability
is
,
that
you
will
be
shot
lightly
out
before
you
have
completed
the
third
mile
.
   
<EOS>
We
are
not
aware
of
any
instance
on
record
in
which
a
cab
-
horse
has
performed
three
consecutive
miles
without
going
down
once
.
 
<EOS>
What
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
all
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
these
days
of
derangement
of
the
nervous
system
and
universal
lassitude
,
people
are
content
to
pay
handsomely
for
excitement
;
where
can
it
be
procured
at
a
cheaper
rate
?
   
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
the
red
cab
;
it
was
omnipresent
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
but
to
walk
down
Holborn
,
or
Fleet
-
street
,
or
any
of
the
principal
thoroughfares
in
which
there
is
a
great
deal
of
traffic
,
and
judge
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
hardly
turned
into
the
street
,
when
you
saw
a
trunk
or
two
,
lying
on
the
ground
:
 
an
uprooted
post
,
a
hat
-
box
,
a
portmanteau
,
and
a
carpet
-
bag
,
strewed
about
in
a
very
picturesque
manner
:
 
a
horse
in
a
cab
standing
by
,
looking
about
him
with
great
unconcern
;
and
a
crowd
,
shouting
and
screaming
with
delight
,
cooling
their
flushed
faces
against
the
glass
windows
of
a
chemist
's
shop
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
Need
<EOS>
we
say
it
was
the
red
cab
;
or
that
the
gentleman
with
the
straw
in
his
mouth
,
who
emerged
so
coolly
from
the
chemist
's
shop
and
philosophically
climbing
into
the
little
dickey
,
started
off
at
full
gallop
,
was
the
red
cab
's
licensed
driver
?
   
<EOS>
The
ubiquity
of
this
red
cab
,
and
the
influence
it
exercised
over
the
risible
muscles
of
justice
itself
,
was
perfectly
astonishing
.
<EOS>
You
walked
into
the
justice
-
room
of
the
Mansion
-
house
;
the
whole
court
resounded
with
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lord
Mayor
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
in
a
state
of
frantic
delight
at
his
own
joke
;
every
vein
in
Mr
Hobler
's
countenance
was
swollen
with
laughter
,
partly
at
the
Lord
Mayor
's
facetiousness
,
but
more
at
his
own
;
the
constables
and
police
-
officers
were
(
as
in
duty
bound
)
in
ecstasies
at
Mr
Hobler
and
the
Lord
Mayor
combined
;
and
the
very
paupers
,
glancing
respectfully
at
the
beadle
's
countenance
,
tried
to
smile
,
as
even
he
relaxed
.
 
<EOS>
A
tall
,
weazen
-
faced
man
,
with
an
impediment
in
his
speech
,
would
be
endeavouring
to
state
a
case
of
imposition
against
the
red
cab
's
driver
;
and
the
red
cab
's
driver
,
and
the
Lord
Mayor
,
and
Mr
Hobler
,
would
be
having
a
little
fun
among
themselves
,
to
the
inordinate
delight
of
everybody
but
the
complainant
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
end
,
justice
would
be
so
tickled
with
the
red
cab
-
driver
's
native
humour
,
that
the
fine
would
be
mitigated
,
and
he
would
go
away
full
gallop
,
in
the
red
cab
,
to
impose
on
somebody
else
without
loss
of
time
.
   
<EOS>
The
driver
of
the
red
cab
,
confident
in
the
strength
of
his
own
moral
principles
,
like
many
other
philosophers
,
was
wo
nt
to
set
the
feelings
and
opinions
of
society
at
complete
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
Generally
speaking
,
perhaps
,
he
would
as
soon
carry
a
fare
safely
to
his
destination
,
as
he
would
upset
him
---
sooner
,
perhaps
,
because
in
that
case
he
not
only
got
the
money
,
but
had
the
additional
amusement
of
running
a
longer
heat
against
some
smart
rival
.
 
<EOS>
But
society
made
war
upon
him
in
the
shape
of
penalties
,
and
he
must
make
war
upon
society
in
his
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
reasoning
of
the
red
cab
-
driver
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
bestowed
a
searching
look
upon
the
fare
,
as
he
put
his
hand
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
when
he
had
gone
half
the
mile
,
to
get
the
money
ready
;
and
if
he
brought
forth
eightpence
,
out
he
went
.
   
<EOS>
The
last
time
we
saw
our
friend
was
one
wet
evening
in
Tottenham
-
court
-
road
,
when
he
was
engaged
in
a
very
warm
and
somewhat
personal
altercation
with
a
loquacious
little
gentleman
in
a
green
coat
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
there
were
great
excuses
to
be
made
for
him
:
he
had
not
received
above
eighteenpence
more
than
his
fare
,
and
consequently
laboured
under
a
great
deal
of
very
natural
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
The
dispute
had
attained
a
pretty
considerable
height
,
when
at
last
the
loquacious
little
gentleman
,
making
a
mental
calculation
of
the
distance
,
and
finding
that
he
had
already
paid
more
than
he
ought
,
avowed
his
unalterable
determination
to
"
pull
up
"
the
cabman
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
just
mark
this
,
young
man
,
"
said
the
little
gentleman
,
"
I
'll
pull
you
up
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
will
you
though
?
"
said
our
friend
,
with
a
sneer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
replied
the
little
gentleman
,
"
mark
my
words
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
If
I
live
till
to
-
morrow
morning
,
you
shall
repent
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
steadiness
of
purpose
,
and
indignation
of
speech
,
about
the
little
gentleman
,
as
he
took
an
angry
pinch
of
snuff
,
after
this
last
declaration
,
which
made
a
visible
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
red
cab
-
driver
.
 
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
hesitate
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
for
an
instant
;
his
resolve
was
soon
taken
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
pull
me
up
,
will
you
?
"
said
our
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
rejoined
the
little
gentleman
,
with
even
greater
vehemence
an
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
"
said
our
friend
,
tucking
up
his
shirt
sleeves
very
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
'll
be
three
veeks
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
Wery
good
;
that
'll
bring
me
up
to
the
middle
o
'
next
month
.
 
<EOS>
Three
veeks
more
would
carry
me
on
to
my
birthday
,
and
then
I
've
got
ten
pound
to
draw
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
get
board
,
lodgin
'
,
and
washin
'
,
till
then
,
out
of
the
county
,
as
pay
for
it
myself
;
consequently
here
goes
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
without
more
ado
,
the
red
cab
-
driver
knocked
the
little
gentleman
down
,
and
then
called
the
police
to
take
himself
into
custody
,
with
all
the
civility
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
A
story
is
nothing
without
the
sequel
;
and
therefore
,
we
may
state
,
that
to
our
certain
knowledge
,
the
board
,
lodging
,
and
washing
were
all
provided
in
due
course
.
 
<EOS>
We
happen
to
know
the
fact
,
for
it
came
to
our
knowledge
thus
:
 
<EOS>
We
went
over
the
House
of
Correction
for
the
county
of
Middlesex
shortly
after
,
to
witness
the
operation
of
the
silent
system
;
and
looked
on
all
the
"
wheels
"
with
the
greatest
anxiety
,
in
search
of
our
long
-
lost
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
,
however
,
and
we
began
to
think
that
the
little
gentleman
in
the
green
coat
must
have
relented
,
when
,
as
we
were
traversing
the
kitchen
-
garden
,
which
lies
in
a
sequestered
part
of
the
prison
,
we
were
startled
by
hearing
a
voice
,
which
apparently
proceeded
from
the
wall
,
pouring
forth
its
soul
in
the
plaintive
air
of
"
All
round
my
hat
,
"
which
was
then
just
beginning
to
form
a
recognised
portion
of
our
national
music
.
   
<EOS>
We
started
.
<EOS>
---
"
What
voice
is
that
?
"
said
we
.
 
<EOS>
The
Governor
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sad
fellow
,
"
he
replied
,
"
very
sad
.
 
<EOS>
He
positively
refused
to
work
on
the
wheel
;
so
,
after
many
trials
,
I
was
compelled
to
order
him
into
solitary
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
he
likes
it
very
much
though
,
and
I
am
afraid
he
does
,
for
he
lies
on
his
back
on
the
floor
,
and
sings
comic
songs
all
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
Shall
we
add
,
that
our
heart
had
not
deceived
us
and
that
the
comic
singer
was
no
other
than
our
eagerly
-
sought
friend
,
the
red
cab
-
driver
?
   
<EOS>
We
have
never
seen
him
since
,
but
we
have
strong
reason
to
suspect
that
this
noble
individual
was
a
distant
relative
of
a
waterman
of
our
acquaintance
,
who
,
on
one
occasion
,
when
we
were
passing
the
coach
-
stand
over
which
he
presides
,
after
standing
very
quietly
to
see
a
tall
man
struggle
into
a
cab
,
ran
up
very
briskly
when
it
was
all
over
(
as
his
brethren
invariably
do
)
,
and
,
touching
his
hat
,
asked
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
for
"
a
copper
for
the
waterman
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
the
fare
was
by
no
means
a
handsome
man
;
and
,
waxing
very
indignant
at
the
demand
,
he
replied
---
"
Money
!
 
<EOS>
What
for
?
 
<EOS>
Coming
up
and
looking
at
me
,
I
suppose
!
<EOS>
"
---
"
Vell
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
waterman
,
with
a
smile
of
immovable
complacency
,
"
THAT
'S
worth
twopence
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
identical
waterman
afterwards
attained
a
very
prominent
station
in
society
;
and
as
we
know
something
of
his
life
,
and
have
often
thought
of
telling
what
we
DO
know
,
perhaps
we
shall
never
have
a
better
opportunity
than
the
present
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
William
Barker
,
then
,
for
that
was
the
gentleman
's
name
<EOS>
,
Mr
William
Barker
was
born
---
but
why
need
we
relate
where
Mr
William
Barker
was
born
,
or
when
?
 
<EOS>
Why
scrutinise
the
entries
in
parochial
ledgers
,
or
seek
to
penetrate
the
Lucinian
mysteries
of
lying
-
in
hospitals
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
William
Barker
WAS
born
,
or
he
had
never
been
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
son
---
there
was
a
father
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
effect
---
there
was
a
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
this
is
sufficient
information
for
the
most
Fatima
-
like
curiosity
;
and
,
if
it
be
not
,
we
regret
our
inability
to
supply
any
further
evidence
on
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
Can
there
be
a
more
satisfactory
,
or
more
strictly
parliamentary
course
?
 
<EOS>
Impossible
.
   
<EOS>
We
at
once
avow
a
similar
inability
to
record
at
what
precise
period
,
or
by
what
particular
process
<EOS>
,
this
gentleman
's
patronymic
,
of
William
Barker
,
became
corrupted
into
"
Bill
Boorker
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
acquired
a
high
standing
,
and
no
inconsiderable
reputation
,
among
the
members
of
that
profession
to
which
he
more
peculiarly
devoted
his
energies
;
and
to
them
he
was
generally
known
,
either
by
the
familiar
appellation
of
"
Bill
Boorker
,
"
or
the
flattering
designation
of
"
Aggerawatin
'
Bill
,
"
the
latter
being
a
playful
and
expressive
SOBRIQUET
,
illustrative
of
Mr
Barker
's
great
talent
in
"
aggerawatin
'
"
and
rendering
wild
such
subjects
of
her
Majesty
as
are
conveyed
from
place
to
place
,
through
the
instrumentality
of
omnibuses
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
early
life
of
Mr
Barker
little
is
known
,
and
even
that
little
is
involved
in
considerable
doubt
and
obscurity
.
<EOS>
A
want
of
application
,
a
restlessness
of
purpose
,
a
thirsting
after
porter
,
a
love
of
all
that
is
roving
and
cadger
-
like
in
nature
,
shared
in
common
with
many
other
great
geniuses
,
appear
to
have
been
his
leading
characteristics
.
 
<EOS>
The
busy
hum
of
a
parochial
free
-
school
,
and
the
shady
repose
of
a
county
gaol
,
were
alike
inefficacious
in
producing
the
slightest
alteration
in
Mr
Barker
's
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
His
feverish
attachment
to
change
and
variety
nothing
could
repress
;
his
native
daring
no
punishment
could
subdue
.
   
<EOS>
If
Mr
Barker
can
be
fairly
said
to
have
had
any
weakness
in
his
earlier
years
,
it
was
an
amiable
one
---
love
;
love
in
its
most
comprehensive
form
---
a
love
of
ladies
,
liquids
,
and
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
selfish
feeling
;
it
was
not
confined
to
his
own
possessions
,
which
but
too
many
men
regard
with
exclusive
complacency
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
it
was
a
nobler
love
---
a
general
principle
.
 
<EOS>
It
extended
itself
with
equal
force
to
the
property
of
other
people
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
something
very
affecting
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
still
more
affecting
to
know
,
that
such
philanthropy
is
but
imperfectly
rewarded
.
 
<EOS>
Bow
-
street
,
Newgate
,
and
Millbank
,
are
a
poor
return
for
general
benevolence
,
evincing
itself
in
an
irrepressible
love
for
all
created
objects
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
felt
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
lengthened
interview
with
the
highest
legal
authorities
,
he
quitted
his
ungrateful
country
,
with
the
consent
,
and
at
the
expense
,
of
its
Government
;
proceeded
to
a
distant
shore
;
and
there
employed
himself
,
like
another
Cincinnatus
,
in
clearing
and
cultivating
the
soil
---
a
peaceful
pursuit
,
in
which
a
term
of
seven
years
glided
almost
imperceptibly
away
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
,
at
the
expiration
of
the
period
we
have
just
mentioned
,
the
British
Government
required
Mr
Barker
's
presence
here
,
or
did
not
require
his
residence
abroad
,
we
have
no
distinct
means
of
ascertaining
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
be
inclined
,
however
,
to
favour
the
latter
position
,
inasmuch
as
we
do
not
find
that
he
was
advanced
to
any
other
public
post
on
his
return
,
than
the
post
at
the
corner
of
the
Haymarket
,
where
he
officiated
as
assistant
-
waterman
to
the
hackney
-
coach
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Seated
,
in
this
capacity
,
on
a
couple
of
tubs
near
the
curbstone
,
with
a
brass
plate
and
number
suspended
round
his
neck
by
a
massive
chain
,
and
his
ankles
curiously
enveloped
in
haybands
,
he
is
supposed
to
have
made
those
observations
on
human
nature
which
exercised
so
material
an
influence
over
all
his
proceedings
in
later
life
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
had
not
officiated
for
many
months
in
this
capacity
,
when
the
appearance
of
the
first
omnibus
caused
the
public
mind
to
go
in
a
new
direction
,
and
prevented
a
great
many
hackney
-
coaches
from
going
in
any
direction
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
genius
of
Mr
Barker
at
once
perceived
the
whole
extent
of
the
injury
that
would
be
eventually
inflicted
on
cab
and
coach
stands
,
and
,
by
consequence
,
on
watermen
also
,
by
the
progress
of
the
system
of
which
the
first
omnibus
was
a
part
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
,
too
,
the
necessity
of
adopting
some
more
profitable
profession
;
and
his
active
mind
at
once
perceived
how
much
might
be
done
in
the
way
of
enticing
the
youthful
and
unwary
,
and
shoving
the
old
and
helpless
,
into
the
wrong
buss
,
and
carrying
them
off
,
until
,
reduced
to
despair
,
they
ransomed
themselves
by
the
payment
of
sixpence
a
-
head
,
or
,
to
adopt
his
own
figurative
expression
in
all
its
native
beauty
,
"
till
they
was
rig'larly
done
over
,
and
forked
out
the
stumpy
.
"
   
<EOS>
An
opportunity
for
realising
his
fondest
anticipations
,
soon
presented
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Rumours
were
rife
on
the
hackney
-
coach
stands
,
that
a
buss
was
building
,
to
run
from
Lisson
-
grove
to
the
Bank
,
down
Oxford
-
street
and
Holborn
;
and
the
rapid
increase
of
busses
on
the
Paddington
-
road
,
encouraged
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
secretly
and
cautiously
inquired
in
the
proper
quarters
.
 
<EOS>
The
report
was
correct
;
the
"
Royal
William
"
was
to
make
its
first
journey
on
the
following
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
crack
affair
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
An
enterprising
young
cabman
,
of
established
reputation
as
a
dashing
whip
---
for
he
had
compromised
with
the
parents
of
three
scrunched
children
,
and
just
"
worked
out
"
his
fine
for
knocking
down
an
old
lady
---
was
the
driver
;
and
the
spirited
proprietor
,
knowing
Mr
Barker
's
qualifications
,
appointed
him
to
the
vacant
office
of
cad
on
the
very
first
application
.
 
<EOS>
The
buss
began
to
run
,
and
Mr
Barker
entered
into
a
new
suit
of
clothes
,
and
on
a
new
sphere
of
action
.
   
<EOS>
To
recapitulate
all
the
improvements
introduced
by
this
extraordinary
man
into
the
omnibus
system
---
gradually
,
indeed
,
but
surely
---
would
occupy
a
far
greater
space
than
we
are
enabled
to
devote
to
this
imperfect
memoir
.
 
<EOS>
To
him
is
universally
assigned
the
original
suggestion
of
the
practice
which
afterwards
became
so
general
---
of
the
driver
of
a
second
buss
keeping
constantly
behind
the
first
one
,
and
driving
the
pole
of
his
vehicle
either
into
the
door
of
the
other
,
every
time
it
was
opened
,
or
through
the
body
of
any
lady
or
gentleman
who
might
make
an
attempt
to
get
into
it
;
a
humorous
and
pleasant
invention
,
exhibiting
all
that
originality
of
idea
,
and
fine
,
bold
flow
of
spirits
,
so
conspicuous
in
every
action
of
this
great
man
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
had
opponents
of
course
;
what
man
in
public
life
has
not
?
 
<EOS>
But
even
his
worst
enemies
can
not
deny
that
he
has
taken
more
old
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
Paddington
who
wanted
to
go
to
the
Bank
,
and
more
old
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
the
Bank
who
wanted
to
go
to
Paddington
,
than
any
six
men
on
the
road
;
and
however
much
malevolent
spirits
may
pretend
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
the
statement
<EOS>
,
they
well
know
it
to
be
an
established
fact
,
that
he
has
forcibly
conveyed
a
variety
of
ancient
persons
of
either
sex
,
to
both
places
,
who
had
not
the
slightest
or
most
distant
intention
of
going
anywhere
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
was
the
identical
cad
who
nobly
distinguished
himself
,
some
time
since
,
by
keeping
a
tradesman
on
the
step
---
the
omnibus
going
at
full
speed
all
the
time
---
till
he
had
thrashed
him
to
his
entire
satisfaction
,
and
finally
throwing
him
away
,
when
he
had
quite
done
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
<EOS>
it
OUGHT
to
have
been
,
who
honestly
indignant
at
being
ignominiously
ejected
from
a
house
of
public
entertainment
,
kicked
the
landlord
in
the
knee
,
and
thereby
caused
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
it
OUGHT
to
have
been
Mr
Barker
,
because
the
action
was
not
a
common
one
,
and
could
have
emanated
from
no
ordinary
mind
.
   
<EOS>
It
has
now
become
matter
of
history
;
it
is
recorded
in
the
Newgate
Calendar
;
and
we
wish
we
could
attribute
this
piece
of
daring
heroism
to
Mr
Barker
.
 
<EOS>
We
regret
being
compelled
to
state
that
it
was
not
performed
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
Would
,
for
the
family
credit
we
could
add
,
that
it
was
achieved
by
his
brother
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
exercise
of
the
nicer
details
of
his
profession
,
that
Mr
Barker
's
knowledge
of
human
nature
was
beautifully
displayed
.
<EOS>
He
could
tell
at
a
glance
where
a
passenger
wanted
to
go
to
,
and
would
shout
the
name
of
the
place
accordingly
,
without
the
slightest
reference
to
the
real
destination
of
the
vehicle
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
exactly
the
kind
of
old
lady
that
would
be
too
much
flurried
by
the
process
of
pushing
in
and
pulling
out
of
the
caravan
,
to
discover
where
she
had
been
put
down
,
until
too
late
;
had
an
intuitive
perception
of
what
was
passing
in
a
passenger
's
mind
when
he
inwardly
resolved
to
"
pull
that
cad
up
to
-
morrow
morning
;
"
and
never
failed
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
female
servants
,
whom
he
would
place
next
the
door
,
and
talk
to
all
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
Human
judgment
is
never
infallible
,
and
it
would
occasionally
happen
that
Mr
Barker
experimentalised
with
the
timidity
or
forbearance
of
the
wrong
person
,
in
which
case
a
summons
to
a
Police
-
office
,
was
,
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
followed
by
a
committal
to
prison
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
the
power
of
trifles
such
as
these
,
however
,
to
subdue
the
freedom
of
his
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
passed
away
,
he
resumed
the
duties
of
his
profession
with
unabated
ardour
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
spoken
of
Mr
Barker
and
of
the
red
cab
-
driver
,
in
the
past
tense
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
has
again
become
an
absentee
;
and
the
class
of
men
to
which
they
both
belonged
is
fast
disappearing
.
<EOS>
Improvement
has
peered
beneath
the
aprons
of
our
cabs
,
and
penetrated
to
the
very
innermost
recesses
of
our
omnibuses
.
 
<EOS>
Dirt
and
fustian
will
vanish
before
cleanliness
and
livery
.
 
<EOS>
Slang
will
be
forgotten
when
civility
becomes
general
:
 
and
that
enlightened
,
eloquent
,
sage
,
and
profound
body
,
the
Magistracy
of
London
,
will
be
deprived
of
half
their
amusement
,
and
half
their
occupation
.

A
parliamentary
sketch
<EOS>
We
hope
our
readers
will
not
be
alarmed
at
this
rather
ominous
title
.
 
<EOS>
We
assure
them
that
we
are
not
about
to
become
political
,
neither
have
we
the
slightest
intention
of
being
more
prosy
than
usual
---
if
we
can
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
occurred
to
us
that
a
slight
sketch
of
the
general
aspect
of
"
the
House
,
"
and
the
crowds
that
resort
to
it
on
the
night
of
an
important
debate
,
would
be
productive
of
some
amusement
:
 
and
as
we
have
made
some
few
calls
at
the
aforesaid
house
in
our
time
---
have
visited
it
quite
often
enough
for
our
purpose
,
and
a
great
deal
too
often
for
our
personal
peace
and
comfort
<EOS>
---
we
have
determined
to
attempt
the
description
.
<EOS>
Dismissing
from
our
minds
,
therefore
,
all
that
feeling
of
awe
,
which
vague
ideas
of
breaches
of
privilege
,
Serjeant
-
at
-
Arms
,
heavy
denunciations
,
and
still
heavier
fees
,
are
calculated
to
awaken
,
we
enter
at
once
into
the
building
,
and
upon
our
subject
.
   
<EOS>
Half
-
past
four
o'clock
---
<EOS>
and
at
five
the
mover
of
the
Address
will
be
"
on
his
legs
,
"
as
the
newspapers
announce
sometimes
by
way
of
novelty
,
as
if
speakers
were
occasionally
in
the
habit
of
standing
on
their
heads
.
 
<EOS>
The
members
are
pouring
in
,
one
after
the
other
,
in
shoals
.
 
<EOS>
The
few
spectators
who
can
obtain
standing
-
room
in
the
passages
,
scrutinise
them
as
they
pass
,
with
the
utmost
interest
,
and
the
man
who
can
identify
a
member
occasionally
,
becomes
a
person
of
great
importance
.
 
<EOS>
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
you
hear
earnest
whispers
of
<EOS>
"
That
's
Sir
John
Thomson
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Which
?
<EOS>
him
with
the
gilt
order
round
his
neck
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
<EOS>
;
that
's
one
of
the
messengers

that
other
with
the
yellow
gloves
,
is
Sir

Here

Mr

Yes

<EOS>
(
He
is
our
new
member
)
---
How
do
you
do
,
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Smith
stops
:
 
turns
round
with
an
air
of
enchanting
urbanity
(
for
the
rumour
of
an
intended
dissolution
has
been
very
extensively
circulated
this
morning
)
;
seizes
both
the
hands
of
his
gratified
constituent
,
and
,
after
greeting
him
with
the
most
enthusiastic
warmth
,
darts
into
the
lobby
with
an
extraordinary
display
of
ardour
in
the
public
cause
,
leaving
an
immense
impression
in
his
favour
on
the
mind
of
his
"
fellow
-
townsman
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
arrivals
increase
in
number
,
and
the
heat
and
noise
increase
in
very
unpleasant
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
The
livery
servants
form
a
complete
lane
on
either
side
of
the
passage
,
and
you
reduce
yourself
into
the
smallest
possible
space
to
avoid
being
turned
out
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
that
stout
man
with
the
hoarse
voice
,
in
the
blue
coat
,
queer
-
crowned
,
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
white
corduroy
breeches
,
and
great
boots
,
who
has
been
talking
incessantly
for
half
an
hour
past
,
and
whose
importance
has
occasioned
no
small
quantity
of
mirth
among
the
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
the
great
conservator
of
the
peace
of
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
fail
to
have
remarked
the
grace
with
which
he
saluted
the
noble
Lord
who
passed
just
now
,
or
the
excessive
dignity
of
his
air
,
as
he
expostulates
with
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
rather
out
of
temper
now
,
in
consequence
of
the
very
irreverent
behaviour
of
those
two
young
fellows
behind
him
,
who
have
done
nothing
but
laugh
all
the
time
they
have
been
here
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
they
divide
to
-
night
,
do
you
think
,
Mr
---
<EOS>
"
timidly
inquires
a
little
thin
man
in
the
crowd
,
hoping
to
conciliate
the
man
of
office
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
CAN
you
ask
such
questions
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
replies
the
functionary
,
in
an
incredibly
loud
key
,
and
pettishly
grasping
the
thick
stick
he
carries
in
his
right
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
not
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
of
you
;
pray
do
not
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
little
man
looks
remarkably
out
of
his
element
,
and
the
uninitiated
part
of
the
throng
are
in
positive
convulsions
of
laughter
.
   
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
some
unfortunate
individual
appears
,
with
a
very
smirking
air
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
passage
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
managed
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
special
constable
downstairs
,
and
is
evidently
congratulating
himself
on
having
made
his
way
so
far
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
back
,
sir
---
you
must
NOT
come
here
,
"
shouts
the
hoarse
one
,
with
tremendous
emphasis
of
voice
and
gesture
,
the
moment
the
offender
catches
his
eye
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
pauses
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
,
sir
---
will
you
go
back
?
<EOS>
"
continues
the
official
dignitary
,
gently
pushing
the
intruder
some
half
-
dozen
yards
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
do
n't
push
me
,
"
replies
the
stranger
,
turning
angrily
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
out
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Take
your
hands
off
me
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
out
of
the
passage
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
Jack
-
in
-
office
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
what
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculates
he
of
the
boots
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
Jack
-
in
-
office
,
sir
,
and
a
very
insolent
fellow
<EOS>
,
"
reiterates
the
stranger
,
now
completely
in
a
passion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
not
force
me
to
put
you
out
,
sir
,
"
retorts
the
other
---
"
pray
<EOS>
do
not
---
my
instructions
are
to
keep
this
passage
clear
<EOS>
---
it
's
the
Speaker
's
orders
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
D

n
the
Speaker
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
shouts
the
intruder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Wilson
!
---
Collins
!
"
<EOS>
gasps
the
officer
,
actually
paralysed
at
this
insulting
expression
,
which
in
his
mind
is
all
but
high
treason
;
"
take
this
man
out
---
take
him
out
,
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
,
sir
?
"
and
down
goes
the
unfortunate
man
five
stairs
at
a
time
,
turning
round
at
every
stoppage
,
to
come
back
again
,
and
denouncing
bitter
vengeance
against
the
commander
-
in
-
chief
,
and
all
his
supernumeraries
.
   
<EOS>
"
Make
way
,
gentlemen
,
---
pray
make
way
for
the
Members
<EOS>
,
I
beg
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
shouts
the
zealous
officer
,
turning
back
,
and
preceding
a
whole
string
of
the
liberal
and
independent
.
   
<EOS>
You
see
this
ferocious
-
looking
gentleman
,
with
a
complexion
almost
as
sallow
as
his
linen
,
and
whose
large
black
moustache
would
give
him
the
appearance
of
a
figure
in
a
hairdresser
's
window
,
if
his
countenance
possessed
the
thought
which
is
communicated
to
those
waxen
caricatures
of
the
human
face
divine
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
militia
-
officer
,
and
the
most
amusing
person
in
the
House
.
 
<EOS>
Can
anything
be
more
exquisitely
absurd
than
the
burlesque
grandeur
of
his
air
,
as
he
strides
up
to
the
lobby
,
his
eyes
rolling
like
those
of
a
Turk
's
head
in
a
cheap
Dutch
clock
?
 
<EOS>
He
never
appears
without
that
bundle
of
dirty
papers
which
he
carries
under
his
left
arm
,
and
which
are
generally
supposed
to
be
the
miscellaneous
estimates
for
1804
,
or
some
equally
important
documents
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
very
punctual
in
his
attendance
at
the
House
,
and
his
self
-
satisfied
"
<EOS>
He
-
ar
-
He
-
ar
,
"
is
not
unfrequently
the
signal
for
a
general
titter
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
the
gentleman
who
once
actually
sent
a
messenger
up
to
the
Strangers
'
gallery
in
the
old
House
of
Commons
,
to
inquire
the
name
of
an
individual
who
was
using
an
eye
-
glass
,
in
order
that
he
might
complain
to
the
Speaker
that
the
person
in
question
was
quizzing
him
!
 
<EOS>
On
another
occasion
,
he
is
reported
to
have
repaired
to
Bellamy
's
kitchen
---
a
refreshment
-
room
,
where
persons
who
are
not
Members
are
admitted
on
sufferance
,
as
it
were
---
and
perceiving
two
or
three
gentlemen
at
supper
,
who
,
he
was
aware
,
were
not
Members
,
and
could
not
,
in
that
place
,
very
well
resent
his
behaviour
,
he
indulged
in
the
pleasantry
of
sitting
with
his
booted
leg
on
the
table
at
which
they
were
supping
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
generally
harmless
,
though
,
and
always
amusing
.
   
<EOS>
By
dint
of
patience
,
and
some
little
interest
with
our
friend
the
constable
,
we
have
contrived
to
make
our
way
to
the
Lobby
,
and
you
can
just
manage
to
catch
an
occasional
glimpse
of
the
House
,
as
the
door
is
opened
for
the
admission
of
Members
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
tolerably
full
already
,
and
little
groups
of
Members
are
congregated
together
here
,
discussing
the
interesting
topics
of
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
That
smart
-
looking
fellow
in
the
black
coat
with
velvet
facings
and
cuffs
,
who
wears
his
D'ORSAY
hat
so
rakishly
,
is
"
Honest
Tom
,
"
a
metropolitan
representative
;
and
the
large
man
in
the
cloak
with
the
white
lining
---
not
the
man
by
the
pillar
;
the
other
with
the
light
hair
hanging
over
his
coat
collar
behind
---
is
his
colleague
.
<EOS>
The
quiet
gentlemanly
-
looking
man
in
the
blue
surtout
,
gray
trousers
,
white
neckerchief
and
gloves
,
whose
closely
-
buttoned
coat
displays
his
manly
figure
and
broad
chest
to
great
advantage
,
is
a
very
well
-
known
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
fought
a
great
many
battles
in
his
time
,
and
conquered
like
the
heroes
of
old
,
with
no
other
arms
than
those
the
gods
gave
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
hard
-
featured
man
who
is
standing
near
him
,
is
really
a
good
specimen
of
a
class
of
men
,
now
nearly
extinct
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
county
Member
,
and
has
been
from
time
<EOS>
whereof
the
memory
of
man
is
not
to
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
his
loose
,
wide
,
brown
coat
,
with
capacious
pockets
on
each
side
;
the
knee
-
breeches
and
boots
,
the
immensely
long
waistcoat
,
and
silver
watch
-
chain
dangling
below
it
,
the
wide
-
brimmed
brown
hat
,
and
the
white
handkerchief
tied
in
a
great
bow
,
with
straggling
ends
sticking
out
beyond
his
shirt
-
frill
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
costume
one
seldom
sees
nowadays
,
and
when
the
few
who
wear
it
have
died
off
,
it
will
be
quite
extinct
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
tell
you
long
stories
of
Fox
,
Pitt
,
Sheridan
,
and
Canning
,
and
how
much
better
the
House
was
managed
in
those
times
,
when
they
used
to
get
up
at
eight
or
nine
o'clock
,
except
on
regular
field
-
days
,
of
which
everybody
was
apprised
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
great
contempt
for
all
young
Members
of
Parliament
,
and
thinks
it
quite
impossible
that
a
man
can
say
anything
worth
hearing
,
unless
he
has
sat
in
the
House
for
fifteen
years
at
least
,
without
saying
anything
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
of
opinion
that
"
that
young
Macaulay
"
was
a
regular
impostor
;
he
allows
,
that
Lord
Stanley
may
do
something
one
of
these
days
,
but
"
he
's
too
young
,
sir
---
too
young
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
is
an
excellent
authority
on
points
of
precedent
,
and
when
he
grows
talkative
,
after
his
wine
,
will
tell
you
how
Sir
Somebody
Something
,
when
he
was
whipper
-
in
for
the
Government
,
brought
four
men
out
of
their
beds
to
vote
in
the
majority
,
three
of
whom
died
on
their
way
home
again
;
how
the
House
once
divided
on
the
question
,
that
fresh
candles
be
now
brought
in
;
how
the
Speaker
was
once
upon
a
time
left
in
the
chair
by
accident
,
at
the
conclusion
of
business
,
and
was
obliged
to
sit
in
the
House
by
himself
for
three
hours
,
till
some
Member
could
be
knocked
up
and
brought
back
again
,
to
move
the
adjournment
;
and
a
great
many
other
anecdotes
of
a
similar
description
.
   
<EOS>
There
he
stands
,
leaning
on
his
stick
;
looking
at
the
throng
of
Exquisites
around
him
with
most
profound
contempt
;
and
conjuring
up
,
before
his
mind
's
eye
,
the
scenes
he
beheld
in
the
old
House
,
in
days
gone
by
,
when
his
own
feelings
were
fresher
and
brighter
,
and
when
,
as
he
imagines
,
wit
,
talent
,
and
patriotism
flourished
more
brightly
too
.
   
<EOS>
You
are
curious
to
know
who
that
young
man
in
the
rough
great
-
coat
is
,
who
has
accosted
every
Member
who
has
entered
the
House
since
we
have
been
standing
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
a
Member
;
he
is
only
an
"
hereditary
bondsman
,
"
or
,
in
other
words
,
an
Irish
correspondent
of
an
Irish
newspaper
,
who
has
just
procured
his
forty
-
second
frank
from
a
Member
whom
he
never
saw
in
his
life
before
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
goes
again
---
another
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
<EOS>
the
man
,
he
has
his
hat
and
pockets
full
already
.
   
<EOS>
We
will
try
our
fortune
at
the
Strangers
'
gallery
,
though
the
nature
of
the
debate
encourages
very
little
hope
of
success
.
 
<EOS>
What
on
earth
are
you
about
?
 
<EOS>
Holding
up
your
order
as
if
it
were
a
talisman
at
whose
command
the
wicket
would
fly
open
?
 
<EOS>
Nonsense
.
<EOS>
Just
preserve
the
order
for
an
autograph
,
if
it
be
worth
keeping
at
all
,
and
make
your
appearance
at
the
door
with
your
thumb
and
forefinger
expressively
inserted
in
your
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
This
tall
stout
man
in
black
is
the
door
-
keeper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Any
room
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
an
inch
---
two
or
three
dozen
gentlemen
waiting
down
-
stairs
on
the
chance
of
somebody
's
going
out
.
"
 
Pull
out
your
purse
---
<EOS>
"
Are
you
QUITE
sure
there
's
no
room
?
"
---
"
I
'll
go
and
look
,
"
replies
the
door
-
keeper
,
with
a
wistful
glance
at
your
purse
,
"
but
I
'm
afraid
there
's
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
returns
,
and
with
real
feeling
assures
you
that
it
is
morally
impossible
to
get
near
the
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
of
no
use
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
are
refused
admission
into
the
Strangers
'
gallery
at
the
House
of
Commons
,
under
such
circumstances
,
you
may
return
home
thoroughly
satisfied
that
the
place
must
be
remarkably
full
indeed

Retracing
our
steps
through
the
long
passage
,
descending
the
stairs
,
and
crossing
Palace
-
yard
,
we
halt
at
a
small
temporary
doorway
adjoining
the
King
's
entrance
to
the
House
of
Lords
.
 
<EOS>
The
order
of
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
will
admit
you
into
the
Reporters
'
gallery
,
from
whence
you
can
obtain
a
tolerably
good
view
of
the
House
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
of
the
stairs
,
they
are
none
of
the
best
;
through
this
little
wicket
---
there
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
your
eyes
become
a
little
used
to
the
mist
of
the
place
,
and
the
glare
of
the
chandeliers
below
you
,
you
will
see
that
some
unimportant
personage
on
the
Ministerial
side
of
the
House
(
to
your
right
hand
)
is
speaking
,
amidst
a
hum
of
voices
and
confusion
which
would
rival
Babel
,
but
for
the
circumstance
of
its
being
all
in
one
language
.
   
<EOS>
The
"
hear
,
hear
,
"
which
occasioned
that
laugh
,
proceeded
from
our
warlike
friend
with
the
moustache
;
he
is
sitting
on
the
back
seat
against
the
wall
,
behind
the
Member
who
is
speaking
,
looking
as
ferocious
and
intellectual
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Take
one
look
around
you
,
and
retire
!
 
<EOS>
The
body
of
the
House
and
the
side
galleries
are
full
of
Members
;
some
,
with
their
legs
on
the
back
of
the
opposite
seat
;
some
,
with
theirs
stretched
out
to
their
utmost
length
on
the
floor
;
some
going
out
,
others
coming
in
;
all
talking
,
laughing
,
lounging
,
coughing
,
oh
-
ing
,
questioning
,
or
groaning
;
presenting
a
conglomeration
of
noise
and
confusion
,
to
be
met
with
in
no
other
place
in
existence
,
not
even
excepting
Smithfield
on
a
market
-
day
,
or
a
cock
-
pit
in
its
glory
.
   
<EOS>
But
let
us
not
omit
to
notice
Bellamy
's
kitchen
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
the
refreshment
-
room
,
common
to
both
Houses
of
Parliament
,
where
Ministerialists
and
Oppositionists
,
Whigs
and
Tories
,
Radicals
,
Peers
,
and
Destructives
,
strangers
from
the
gallery
,
and
the
more
favoured
strangers
from
below
the
bar
,
are
alike
at
liberty
to
resort
;
where
divers
honourable
members
prove
their
perfect
independence
by
remaining
during
the
whole
of
a
heavy
debate
,
solacing
themselves
with
the
creature
comforts
;
and
whence
they
are
summoned
by
whippers
-
in
,
when
the
House
is
on
the
point
of
dividing
;
either
to
give
their
"
conscientious
votes
"
on
questions
of
which
they
are
conscientiously
innocent
of
knowing
anything
<EOS>
whatever
,
or
to
find
a
vent
for
the
playful
exuberance
of
their
wine
-
inspired
fancies
,
in
boisterous
shouts
of
"
Divide
,
"
occasionally
varied
with
a
little
howling
,
barking
,
crowing
,
or
other
ebullitions
of
senatorial
pleasantry
.
   
<EOS>
When
you
have
ascended
the
narrow
staircase
which
,
in
the
present
temporary
House
of
Commons
,
leads
to
the
place
we
are
describing
,
you
will
probably
observe
a
couple
of
rooms
on
your
right
hand
,
with
tables
spread
for
dining
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
of
these
is
the
kitchen
,
although
they
are
both
devoted
to
the
same
purpose
;
the
kitchen
is
further
on
to
our
left
,
up
these
half
-
dozen
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Before
we
ascend
the
staircase
,
however
,
we
must
request
you
to
pause
in
front
of
this
little
bar
-
place
with
the
sash
-
windows
;
and
beg
your
particular
attention
to
the
steady
,
honest
-
looking
old
fellow
in
black
,
who
is
its
sole
occupant
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
<EOS>
(
we
do
not
mind
mentioning
the
old
fellow
's
name
,
for
if
Nicholas
be
not
a
public
man
,
who
is
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
public
men
's
names
are
public
property
)
---
Nicholas
is
the
butler
of
Bellamy
's
,
and
has
held
the
same
place
,
dressed
exactly
in
the
same
manner
,
and
said
precisely
the
same
things
,
ever
since
the
oldest
of
its
present
visitors
can
remember
.
<EOS>
An
excellent
servant
Nicholas
is
---
an
unrivalled
compounder
of
salad
-
dressing
---
an
admirable
preparer
of
soda
-
water
and
lemon
---
a
special
mixer
of
cold
grog
and
punch
---
and
,
above
all
,
an
unequalled
judge
of
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
old
man
have
such
a
thing
as
vanity
in
his
composition
,
this
is
certainly
his
pride
;
and
if
it
be
possible
to
imagine
that
anything
in
this
world
could
disturb
his
impenetrable
calmness
,
we
should
say
it
would
be
the
doubting
his
judgment
on
this
important
point
.
   
<EOS>
We
need
n't
tell
you
all
this
,
however
,
for
if
you
have
an
atom
of
observation
,
one
glance
at
his
sleek
,
knowing
-
looking
head
and
face
---
his
prim
white
neckerchief
,
with
the
wooden
tie
into
which
it
has
been
regularly
folded
for
twenty
years
past
,
merging
by
imperceptible
degrees
into
a
small
-
plaited
shirt
-
frill
---
and
his
comfortable
-
looking
form
encased
in
a
well
-
brushed
suit
of
black
---
would
give
you
a
better
idea
of
his
real
character
than
a
column
of
our
poor
description
could
convey
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
is
rather
out
of
his
element
now
;
he
can
not
see
the
kitchen
as
he
used
to
in
the
old
House
;
there
,
one
window
of
his
glass
-
case
opened
into
the
room
,
and
then
,
for
the
edification
and
behoof
of
more
juvenile
questioners
,
he
would
stand
for
an
hour
together
,
answering
deferential
questions
about
Sheridan
,
and
Percival
,
and
Castlereagh
,
and
Heaven
knows
who
beside
,
with
manifest
delight
,
always
inserting
a
"
Mister
"
before
every
commoner
's
name
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
like
all
men
of
his
age
and
standing
,
has
a
great
idea
of
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
.
 
<EOS>
He
seldom
expresses
any
political
opinions
,
but
we
managed
to
ascertain
,
just
before
the
passing
of
the
Reform
Bill
,
that
Nicholas
was
a
thorough
Reformer
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
our
astonishment
to
discover
shortly
after
the
meeting
of
the
first
reformed
Parliament
,
that
he
was
a
most
inveterate
and
decided
Tory
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
odd
:
 
<EOS>
some
men
change
their
opinions
from
necessity
,
others
from
expediency
,
others
from
inspiration
;
but
that
Nicholas
should
undergo
any
change
in
any
respect
,
<EOS>
was
an
event
we
had
never
contemplated
,
and
should
have
considered
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
His
strong
opinion
against
the
clause
which
empowered
the
metropolitan
districts
to
return
Members
to
Parliament
,
too
,
was
perfectly
unaccountable
.
   
<EOS>
We
discovered
the
secret
at
last
;
the
metropolitan
Members
always
dined
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
rascals
!
 
<EOS>
As
for
giving
additional
Members
to
Ireland
,
it
was
even
worse
---
decidedly
unconstitutional
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
an
Irish
Member
would
go
up
there
,
and
eat
more
dinner
than
three
English
Members
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
no
wine
;
drank
table
-
beer
by
the
half
-
gallon
;
and
went
home
to
Manchester
-
buildings
,
or
Millbank
-
street
,
for
his
whiskey
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
was
the
consequence
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
concern
lost
---
actually
lost
,
sir
---
by
his
patronage
.
 
<EOS>
A
queer
old
fellow
is
Nicholas
,
and
as
completely
a
part
of
the
building
as
the
house
itself
.
 
<EOS>
We
wonder
he
ever
left
the
old
place
,
and
fully
expected
to
see
in
the
papers
,
the
morning
after
the
fire
,
a
pathetic
account
of
an
old
gentleman
in
black
,
of
decent
appearance
,
who
was
seen
at
one
of
the
upper
windows
when
the
flames
were
at
their
height
,
and
declared
his
resolute
intention
of
falling
with
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
got
out
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
was
got
out
---
<EOS>
here
he
is
again
,
looking
as
he
always
does
,
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
bandbox
ever
since
the
last
session
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
is
,
at
his
old
post
every
night
,
just
as
we
have
described
him
:
 
and
,
as
characters
are
scarce
,
and
faithful
servants
scarcer
,
long
may
he
be
there
,
say
we
!
   
<EOS>
Now
,
when
you
have
taken
your
seat
in
the
kitchen
,
and
duly
noticed
the
large
fire
and
roasting
-
jack
at
one
end
of
the
room
---
the
little
table
for
washing
glasses
and
draining
jugs
at
the
other
---
the
clock
over
the
window
opposite
St
Margaret
's
Church
---
the
deal
tables
and
wax
candles
---
the
damask
table
-
cloths
and
bare
floor
---
the
plate
and
china
on
the
tables
,
and
the
gridiron
on
the
fire
;
and
a
few
other
anomalies
peculiar
to
the
place
---
we
will
point
out
to
your
notice
two
or
three
of
the
people
present
,
whose
station
or
absurdities
render
them
the
most
worthy
of
remark
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
half
-
past
twelve
o'clock
,
and
as
the
division
is
not
expected
for
an
hour
or
two
,
a
few
Members
are
lounging
away
the
time
here
in
preference
to
standing
at
the
bar
of
the
House
,
or
sleeping
in
one
of
the
side
galleries
.
 
<EOS>
That
singularly
awkward
and
ungainly
-
looking
man
,
in
the
brownish
-
white
hat
,
with
the
straggling
black
trousers
which
reach
about
half
-
way
down
the
leg
of
his
boots
,
who
is
leaning
against
the
meat
-
screen
,
apparently
deluding
himself
into
the
belief
that
he
is
thinking
about
something
,
is
a
splendid
sample
of
a
Member
of
the
House
of
Commons
concentrating
in
his
own
person
the
wisdom
of
a
constituency
.
 
<EOS>
Observe
the
wig
,
of
a
dark
hue
but
indescribable
colour
,
for
if
it
be
naturally
brown
,
it
has
acquired
a
black
tint
by
long
service
,
and
if
it
be
naturally
black
,
the
same
cause
has
imparted
to
it
a
tinge
of
rusty
brown
;
and
remark
how
very
materially
the
great
blinker
-
like
spectacles
assist
the
expression
of
that
most
intelligent
face
.
 
<EOS>
Seriously
speaking
,
did
you
ever
see
a
countenance
so
expressive
of
the
most
hopeless
extreme
of
heavy
dulness
,
or
behold
a
form
so
strangely
put
together
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
no
great
speaker
:
 
but
when
he
DOES
address
the
House
,
the
effect
is
absolutely
irresistible
.
   
<EOS>
The
small
gentleman
with
the
sharp
nose
,
who
has
just
saluted
him
,
is
a
Member
of
Parliament
,
an
ex
-
Alderman
,
and
a
sort
of
amateur
fireman
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
and
the
celebrated
fireman
's
dog
,
were
observed
to
be
remarkably
active
at
the
conflagration
of
the
two
Houses
of
Parliament
---
they
both
ran
up
and
down
,
and
in
and
out
,
getting
under
people
's
feet
,
and
into
everybody
's
way
,
fully
impressed
with
the
belief
that
they
were
doing
a
great
deal
of
good
,
and
barking
tremendously
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
went
quietly
back
to
his
kennel
with
the
engine
,
but
the
gentleman
kept
up
such
an
incessant
noise
for
some
weeks
after
the
occurrence
,
that
he
became
a
positive
nuisance
.
 
<EOS>
As
no
more
parliamentary
fires
have
occurred
,
however
,
and
as
he
has
consequently
had
no
more
opportunities
of
writing
to
the
newspapers
to
relate
how
,
by
way
of
preserving
pictures
he
cut
them
out
of
their
frames
,
and
performed
other
great
national
services
,
he
has
gradually
relapsed
into
his
old
state
of
calmness
.
   
<EOS>
That
female
in
black
---
not
the
one
whom
the
Lord's
-
Day
-
Bill
Baronet
has
just
chucked
under
the
chin
;
the
shorter
of
the
two
---
is
"
Jane
:
"
the
Hebe
of
Bellamy
's
.
 
<EOS>
Jane
is
as
great
a
character
as
Nicholas
,
in
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
Her
leading
features
are
a
thorough
contempt
for
the
great
majority
of
her
visitors
;
her
predominant
quality
,
love
of
admiration
,
as
you
can
not
fail
to
observe
,
if
you
mark
the
glee
with
which
she
listens
to
something
the
young
Member
near
her
mutters
somewhat
unintelligibly
in
her
ear
(
for
his
speech
is
rather
thick
from
some
cause
or
other
)
,
and
how
playfully
she
digs
the
handle
of
a
fork
into
the
arm
with
which
he
detains
her
,
by
way
of
reply

Jane
is
no
bad
hand
at
repartees
,
and
showers
them
about
,
with
a
degree
of
liberality
and
total
absence
of
reserve
or
constraint
,
which
occasionally
excites
no
small
amazement
in
the
minds
of
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
She
cuts
jokes
with
Nicholas
,
too
,
but
looks
up
to
him
with
a
great
deal
of
respect
---
the
immovable
stolidity
with
which
Nicholas
receives
the
aforesaid
jokes
,
and
looks
on
,
at
certain
pastoral
friskings
and
rompings
(
Jane
's
only
recreations
,
and
they
are
very
innocent
too
)
which
occasionally
take
place
in
the
passage
,
is
not
the
least
amusing
part
of
his
character
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
persons
who
are
seated
at
the
table
in
the
corner
,
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
have
been
constant
guests
here
,
for
many
years
past
;
and
one
of
them
has
feasted
within
these
walls
,
many
a
time
,
with
the
most
brilliant
characters
of
a
brilliant
period
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
gone
up
to
the
other
House
since
then
;
the
greater
part
of
his
boon
companions
have
shared
Yorick
's
fate
,
and
his
visits
to
Bellamy
's
are
comparatively
few
.
   
<EOS>
If
he
really
be
eating
his
supper
now
,
at
what
hour
can
he
possibly
have
dined
!
 
<EOS>
A
second
solid
mass
of
rump
-
steak
has
disappeared
,
and
he
eat
the
first
in
four
minutes
and
three
quarters
,
by
the
clock
over
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
such
a
personification
of
Falstaff
!
 
<EOS>
Mark
the
air
with
which
he
gloats
over
that
Stilton
,
as
he
removes
the
napkin
which
has
been
placed
beneath
his
chin
to
catch
the
superfluous
gravy
of
the
steak
,
and
with
what
gusto
he
imbibes
the
porter
which
has
been
fetched
,
expressly
for
him
,
in
the
pewter
pot
.
 
<EOS>
Listen
to
the
hoarse
sound
of
that
voice
,
kept
down
as
it
is
by
layers
of
solids
,
and
deep
draughts
of
rich
wine
,
and
tell
us
if
you
ever
saw
such
a
perfect
picture
of
a
regular
GOURMAND
;
and
whether
he
is
not
exactly
the
man
whom
you
would
pitch
upon
as
having
been
the
partner
of
Sheridan
's
parliamentary
carouses
,
the
volunteer
driver
of
the
hackney
-
coach
that
took
him
home
,
and
the
involuntary
upsetter
of
the
whole
party
?
   
<EOS>
What
an
amusing
contrast
between
his
voice
and
appearance
,
and
that
of
the
spare
,
squeaking
old
man
,
who
sits
at
the
same
table
,
and
who
,
elevating
a
little
cracked
bantam
sort
of
voice
to
its
highest
pitch
,
invokes
damnation
upon
his
own
eyes
or
somebody
else
's
at
the
commencement
of
every
sentence
he
utters
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Captain

as
they
call
him

a
very
old

stopping

with
tremendous
violence

a
cry
of

is
heard
in
the
passage

This
is
enough
;

The

is
cleared
in

instant

;
the
noise
rapidly
dies
away
;
you
hear
the
creaking

Public
dinners
All
public
dinners
in
London
,
from
the
Lord
Mayor
's
annual
banquet
at
Guildhall
,
to
the
Chimney

from

Goldsmiths

to

from

Victuallers
'
;
are
amusing
scenes
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
entertainments
of
this
description
,
however
,
we
think
the
annual
dinner
of
some
public
charity
is
the
most
amusing
.
 
<EOS>
At
a
Company
's
dinner
,
the
people
are
nearly
all
alike
---
regular
old
stagers
,
who
make
it
a
matter
of
business
,
and
a
thing
not
to
be
laughed
at
.
 
<EOS>
At
a
political
dinner
,
everybody
is
disagreeable
,
and
inclined
to
speechify
---
much
the
same
thing
,
by
-
the
-
bye
;
but
at
a
charity
dinner
you
see
people
of
all
sorts
,
kinds
,
and
descriptions
.
 
<EOS>
The
wine
may
not
be
remarkably
special
,
to
be
sure
,
and
we
have
heard
some
hardhearted
monsters
grumble
at
the
collection
;
but
we
really
think
the
amusement
to
be
derived
from
the
occasion
,
sufficient
to
counterbalance
even
these
disadvantages
.
   
<EOS>
Let
us
suppose
you
are
induced
to
attend
a
dinner
of
this
description
---
"
Indigent
Orphans
'
Friends
'
Benevolent
Institution
,
"
we
think
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
the
charity
is
a
line
or
two
longer
,
but
never
mind
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
distinct
recollection
,
however
,
that
you
purchased
a
ticket
at
the
solicitation
of
some
charitable
friend
:
 
and
you
deposit
yourself
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
the
driver
of
which
---
no
doubt
that
you
may
do
the
thing
in
style
---
<EOS>
turns
a
deaf
ear
to
your
earnest
entreaties
to
be
set
down
at
the
corner
of
Great
Queen
-
street
,
and
persists
in
carrying
you
to
the
very
door
of
the
Freemasons
'
,
round
which
<EOS>
a
crowd
of
people
are
assembled
to
witness
the
entrance
of
the
indigent
orphans
'
friends
.
<EOS>
You
hear
great
speculations
as
you
pay
the
fare
,
on
the
possibility
of
your
being
the
noble
Lord
who
is
announced
to
fill
the
chair
on
the
occasion
,
and
are
highly
gratified
to
hear
it
eventually
decided
that
you
are
only
a
"
wocalist
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
first
thing
that
strikes
you
,
on
your
entrance
,
is
the
astonishing
importance
of
the
committee
.
 
<EOS>
You
observe
a
door
on
the
first
landing
,
carefully
guarded
by
two
waiters
,
in
and
out
of
which
<EOS>
stout
gentlemen
with
very
red
faces
keep
running
,
with
a
degree
of
speed
highly
unbecoming
the
gravity
of
persons
of
their
years
and
corpulency
.
 
<EOS>
You
pause
,
quite
alarmed
at
the
bustle
,
and
thinking
,
in
your
innocence
,
that
two
or
three
people
must
have
been
carried
out
of
the
dining
-
room
in
fits
,
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
immediately
undeceived
by
the
waiter
---
"
Up
-
stairs
,
if
you
please
,
sir
;
this
is
the
committee
-
room
.
"
 
<EOS>
Up
-
stairs
<EOS>
you
go
,
accordingly
;
wondering
,
as
you
mount
,
what
the
duties
of
the
committee
can
be
,
and
whether
they
ever
do
anything
beyond
confusing
each
other
,
and
running
over
the
waiters
.
   
<EOS>
Having
deposited
your
hat
and
cloak
,
and
received
a
remarkably
small
scrap
of
pasteboard
in
exchange
(
which
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
you
lose
,
before
you
require
it
again
)
,
you
enter
the
hall
,
down
which
there
are
three
long
tables
for
the
less
distinguished
guests
,
with
a
cross
table
on
a
raised
platform
at
the
upper
end
for
the
reception
of
the
very
particular
friends
of
the
indigent
orphans
.
 
<EOS>
Being
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
plate
without
anybody
's
card
in
it
,
you
wisely
seat
yourself
at
once
,
and
have
a
little
leisure
to
look
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
Waiters
,
with
wine
-
baskets
in
their
hands
,
are
placing
decanters
of
sherry
down
the
tables
,
at
very
respectable
distances
;
melancholy
-
looking
salt
-
cellars
,
and
decayed
vinegar
-
cruets
,
which
might
have
belonged
to
the
parents
of
the
indigent
orphans
in
their
time
,
are
scattered
at
distant
intervals
on
the
cloth
;
and
the
knives
and
forks
look
as
if
they
had
done
duty
at
every
public
dinner
in
London
since
the
accession
of
George
the
First
.
 
<EOS>
The
musicians
are
scraping
and
grating
and
screwing
tremendously
---
playing
no
notes
but
notes
of
preparation
;
and
several
gentlemen
are
gliding
along
the
sides
of
the
tables
,
looking
into
plate
after
plate
with
frantic
eagerness
,
the
expression
of
their
countenances
growing
more
and
more
dismal
as
they
meet
with
everybody
's
card
but
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
You
turn
round
to
take
a
look
at
the
table
behind
you
,
and
---
not
being
in
the
habit
of
attending
public
dinners
---
are
somewhat
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
party
on
which
your
eyes
rest
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
its
principal
members
appears
to
be
a
little
man
,
with
a
long
and
rather
inflamed
face
,
and
gray
hair
brushed
bolt
upright
in
front
;
he
wears
a
wisp
of
black
silk
round
his
neck
,
without
any
stiffener
,
as
an
apology
for
a
neckerchief
,
and
is
addressed
by
his
companions
by
the
familiar
appellation
of
"
Fitz
,
"
or
some
such
monosyllable
.
 
<EOS>
Near
him
is
a
stout
man
in
a
white
neckerchief
and
buff
waistcoat
,
with
shining
dark
hair
,
cut
very
short
in
front
,
and
a
great
,
round
,
healthy
-
looking
face
,
on
which
he
studiously
preserves
a
half
sentimental
simper
.
 
<EOS>
Next
him
,
again
,
is
a
large
-
headed
man
,
with
black
hair
and
bushy
whiskers
;
and
opposite
them
are
two
or
three
others
,
one
of
whom
is
a
little
round
-
faced
person
,
in
a
dress
-
stock
and
blue
under
-
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
peculiar
in
their
air
and
manner
,
though
you
could
hardly
describe
what
it
is
;
you
can
not
divest
yourself
of
the
idea
that
they
have
come
for
some
other
purpose
than
mere
eating
and
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
time
to
debate
the
matter
,
however
,
for
the
waiters
(
who
have
been
arranged
in
lines
down
the
room
,
placing
the
dishes
on
table
)
retire
to
the
lower
end
;
the
dark
man
in
the
blue
coat
and
bright
buttons
,
who
has
the
direction
of
the
music
,
looks
up
to
the
gallery
,
and
calls
out
"
band
"
in
a
very
loud
voice
;
out
burst
the
orchestra
,
up
rise
the
visitors
,
in
march
fourteen
stewards
,
each
with
a
long
wand
in
his
hand
,
like
the
evil
genius
in
a
pantomime
;
then
the
chairman
,
then
the
titled
visitors
;
they
all
make
their
way
up
the
room
,
as
fast
as
they
can
,
bowing
,
and
smiling
,
and
smirking
,
and
looking
remarkably
amiable
.
 
<EOS>
The
applause
ceases
,
grace
is
said
,
the
clatter
of
plates
and
dishes
begins
;
and
every
one
appears
highly
gratified
,
either
with
the
presence
of
the
distinguished
visitors
,
or
the
commencement
of
the
anxiously
-
expected
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
the
dinner
itself
---
the
mere
dinner
---
it
goes
off
much
the
same
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Tureens
of
soup
are
emptied
with
awful
rapidity
---
waiters
take
plates
of
turbot
away
,
to
get
lobster
-
sauce
,
and
bring
back
plates
of
lobster
-
sauce
without
turbot
;
people
who
can
carve
poultry
,
are
great
fools
if
they
own
it
,
and
people
who
ca
n't
have
no
wish
to
learn
.
 
<EOS>
The
knives
and
forks
form
a
pleasing
accompaniment
to
Auber
's
music
,
and
Auber
's
music
would
form
a
pleasing
accompaniment
to
the
dinner
,
if
you
could
hear
anything
besides
the
cymbals
.
 
<EOS>
The
substantials
disappear
---
moulds
of
jelly
vanish
like
lightning
---
hearty
eaters
wipe
their
foreheads
,
and
appear
rather
overcome
by
their
recent
exertions
---
people
who
have
looked
very
cross
hitherto
,
become
remarkably
bland
,
and
ask
you
to
take
wine
in
the
most
friendly
manner
possible
---
old
gentlemen
direct
your
attention
to
the
ladies
'
gallery
,
and
take
great
pains
to
impress
you
with
the
fact
that
the
charity
is
always
peculiarly
favoured
in
this
respect
---
every
one
appears
disposed
to
become
talkative
---
and
the
hum
of
conversation
is
loud
and
general
.
   
<EOS>
"

The

whom
you
discover
to
be
no
other

the
very
party
that
excited
your
curiosity
at
first
,
after
"
pitching
"
their
voices
immediately
begin
TOO

TOOing
most
dismally
,
on
which
the
regular

burst
into
occasional
cries

delivered
in
a
tone

indignant
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
The
grace
is
soon
concluded
,
and
the
company
resume
their
seats
.
 
<EOS>
The
uninitiated
portion
of
the
guests
applaud
NON

as
vehemently
as
if
it
were
a
capital
comic
song
,
greatly
to
the
scandal
and
indignation
of
the
regular
diners
,
who
immediately
attempt
to
quell
this
sacrilegious
approbation
,
by
cries
of
"
Hush
,
hush
!
"
<EOS>
whereupon
the
others
,
mistaking
these
sounds
for
hisses
,
applaud
more
tumultuously
than
before
,
and
,
by
way
of
placing
their
approval
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
,
shout
"
ENCORE

"
<EOS>
most
vociferously
.
   
<EOS>
The
moment
the
noise
ceases
,
up
starts
the
toast

master
:

"

<EOS>
Decanters
having
been

filled

the

proceeds

in

rises
,
and
,
after
stating
that
he
feels
it
quite
unnecessary
to
preface
the
toast
he
is
about
to
propose
,
with
any
observations
whatever
,
wanders
into
a
maze
of
sentences
,
and
flounders
about
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
,
presenting
a
lamentable
spectacle
of
mystified
humanity
,
until
he
arrives
at
the
words
,
"
constitutional
sovereign
of
these
realms
,
"
at
which
elderly
gentlemen
exclaim
"
Bravo
!
"
and
hammer
the
table
tremendously
with
their
knife

handles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Under
any
circumstances
,
it
would
give
him
the
greatest
pride
,
it
would
give
him
the
greatest
pleasure

he
might
almost
say
,
it
would
afford
him
satisfaction
[

to
propose
that
toast

<EOS>
What
must
be
his

,

he
has
the
gratification
of
announcing
,
that

This

has
been
regularly
made
by
every
chairman
,
since
the
first
foundation
of

forty

calls
forth
the
most
vociferous
applause
;
the
toast
is
drunk
with
a
great
deal
of
cheering
and
knocking
;
and
"
God

the
Queen

"
is
sung
by
the
"
professional
gentlemen
;
"
the
unprofessional
gentlemen
joining
in
the
chorus
,
and
giving
the
national
anthem
an
effect
which
the
newspapers
,
with
great
justice
,
describe
as
"
perfectly
electrical

The
other
"
loyal

been

with
all

a
comic
song
having
been
well
sung
by
the
gentleman
with
the
small
neckerchief
,
and
a
sentimental
one
by
the
second
of

party
<EOS>
,
we
come
to
the
most
important
toast
of
the
evening
---
<EOS>
"
Prosperity

the
charity
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
again
we
are
compelled
to
adopt
newspaper
phraseology
,
and
to
express
our
regret
at
being
"
precluded
from
giving
even
the
substance
of
the
noble
lord
's
observations
.
"
 
<EOS>
Suffice
<EOS>
it
to
say
,
that
the
speech
,
which
is
somewhat
of
the
longest
,
is
rapturously
received
;
and
the
toast
having
been
drunk
,
the
stewards
(
looking
more
important
than
ever
)
leave
the
room
,
and
presently
return
,
heading
a
procession
of
indigent
orphans
,
boys
and
girls
,
who
walk
round
<EOS>
the
room
,
curtseying
,
and
bowing
,
and
treading
on
each
other
's
heels
,
and
looking
very
much
as
if
they
would
like
a
glass
of
wine
apiece
,
to
the
high
gratification
of
the
company
generally
,

especially
of
the

<EOS>
The
band
plays
a
lively
air
;
the
majority
of
the
company
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
look
rather
serious
;
and
the
noise
of
sovereigns
,
rattling
on
crockery
,
is
heard
from
all
parts
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
short
interval
,
occupied
in
singing
and
toasting
,
the
secretary
puts
on
his
spectacles
,
and
proceeds
to
read
the
report

list
of

the
latter
being
listened
to
with
great

rises
,

proposes

than

he

The

observes

discovers
some

estimable
individual

to

alone
the
senior
officer
is
inferior

and
so
they
go
on
toasting

ILLEGAL
WATCHWORD
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
of
May
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
merry
freshness
in
the
sound
,
calling
to
our
minds
a
thousand
thoughts
of
all
that
is
pleasant
in
nature
and
beautiful
in
her
most
delightful
form
.
 
<EOS>
What
man
is
there
,
over
whose
mind
a
bright
spring
morning
does
not
exercise
a
magic
influence
---
carrying
him
back
to
the
days
of
his
childish
sports
,
and
conjuring
up
before
him
the
old
green
field
with
its
gently
-
waving
trees
,
where
the
birds
sang
as
he
has
never
heard
them
since
---
where
the
butterfly
fluttered
far
more
gaily
than
he
ever
sees
him
now
,
in
all
his
ramblings
---
where
the
sky
seemed
bluer
,
and
the
sun
shone
more
brightly
---
where
the
air
blew
more
freshly
over
greener
grass
,
and
sweeter
-
smelling
flowers
---
where
everything
wore
a
richer
and
more
brilliant
hue
than
it
is
ever
dressed
in
now
!
<EOS>
Such
are
the
deep
feelings
of
childhood
,
and
such
are
the
impressions
which
every
lovely
object
stamps
upon
its
heart
!
 
<EOS>
The
hardy
traveller
wanders
through
the
maze
of
thick
and
pathless
woods
,
where
the
sun
's
rays
never
shone
,
and
heaven
's
pure
air
never
played
;
he
stands
on
the
brink
of
the
roaring
waterfall
,
and
,
giddy
and
bewildered
,
watches
the
foaming
mass
as
it
leaps
from
stone
to
stone
,
and
from
crag
to
crag
;
he
lingers
in
the
fertile
plains
of
a
land
of
perpetual
sunshine
,
and
revels
in
the
luxury
of
their
balmy
breath
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
are
the
deep
forests
,
or
the
thundering
waters
,
or
the
richest
landscapes
that
bounteous
nature
ever
spread
,
to
charm
the
eyes
,
and
captivate
the
senses
of
man
,
compared
with
the
recollection
of
the
old
scenes
of
his
early
youth
?
 
<EOS>
Magic
scenes
indeed
;
for
the
fancies
of
childhood
dressed
them
in
colours
brighter
than
the
rainbow
,
and
almost
as
fleeting
!
   
<EOS>
In
former
times
,
spring
brought
with
it
not
only
such
associations
as
these
,
connected
with
the
past
,
but
sports
and
games
for
the
present
<EOS>
---
merry
dances
round
rustic
pillars
,
adorned
with
emblems
of
the
season
,
and
reared
in
honour
of
its
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Where
are
they
now
!
 
<EOS>
Pillars
we
have
,
but
they
are
no
longer
rustic
ones
;
and
as
to
dancers
,
they
are
used
to
rooms
,
and
lights
,
and
would
not
show
well
in
the
open
air
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
the
immorality
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
What
would
your
sabbath
enthusiasts
say
,
to
an
aristocratic
ring
encircling
the
Duke
of
York
's
column
in
Carlton
-
terrace
---
a
grand
POUSSETTE
of
the
middle
classes
,
<EOS>
round
Alderman
Waithman
's
monument
in
Fleet
-
street
,
---
or
a
general

-
four
-
round
of
ten
-
pound
householders
,
at
the
foot
of
the
Obelisk
in
St
George's
-
fields
?
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
romance
can
make
no
head
against
the
riot
act
;
and
pastoral
simplicity
is
not
understood
by
the
police
.
   
<EOS>
Well
;
many
years
ago
we
began
to
be
a
steady
and
matter
-
of
-
fact
sort
of
people
,
and
dancing
in
spring
being
beneath
our
dignity
,
we
gave
it
up
,
and
in
course
of
time
it
descended
to
the
sweeps
---
a
fall
certainly
,
because
,
though
sweeps
are
very
good
fellows
in
their
way
,
and
moreover
very
useful
in
a
civilised
community
,
they
are
not
exactly
the
sort
of
people
to
give
the
tone
to
the
little
elegances
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
The
sweeps
,
however
,
got
the
dancing
to
themselves
,
and
they
kept
it
up
,
and
handed
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
severe
blow
to
the
romance
of
spring
-
time
,
but
,
it
did
not
entirely
destroy
it
,
either
;
for
a
portion
of
it
descended
to
the
sweeps
with
the
dancing
,
and
rendered
them
objects
of
great
interest
.
 
<EOS>
A
mystery
hung
over
the
sweeps
in
those
days
.
 
<EOS>
Legends
were
in
existence
of
wealthy
gentlemen
who
had
lost
children
,
and
who
,
after
many
years
of
sorrow
and
suffering
,
had
found
them
in
the
character
of
sweeps
.
 
<EOS>
Stories
were
related
of
a
young
boy
who
,
having
been
stolen
from
his
parents
in
his
infancy
,
and
devoted
to
the
occupation
of
chimney
-
sweeping
,
was
sent
,
in
the
course
of
his
professional
career
,
to
sweep
the
chimney
of
his
mother
's
bedroom
;
and
how
,
being
hot
and
tired
when
he
came
out
of
the
chimney
,
he
got
into
the
bed
he
had
so
often
slept
in
as
an
infant
,
and
was
discovered
and
recognised
therein
by
his
mother
,
who
once
every
year
of
her
life
,
thereafter
,
requested
the
pleasure
of
the
company
of
every
London
sweep
,
at
half
-
past
one
o'clock
,
to
roast
beef
,
plum
-
pudding
,
porter
,
and
sixpence
.
   
<EOS>
Such
stories
as
these
,
and
there
were
many
such
,
threw
an
air
of
mystery
round
the
sweeps
,
and
produced
for
them
some
of
those
good
effects
which
animals
derive
from
the
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
(
except
the
masters
)
thought
of
ill
-
treating
a
sweep
,
because
no
one
knew
who
he
might
be
,
or
what
nobleman
's
or
gentleman
's
son
he
might
turn
out
.
 
<EOS>
Chimney
-
sweeping
was
,
by
many
believers
in
the
marvellous
,
considered
as
a
sort
of
probationary
term
,
at
an
earlier
or
later
period
of
which
,
divers
young
noblemen
were
to
come
into
possession
of
their
rank
and
titles
:
 
and
the
profession
was
held
by
them
in
great
respect
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
We
remember
,
in
our
young
days
,
a
little
sweep
about
our
own
age
,
with
curly
hair
and
white
teeth
,
whom
we
devoutly
and
sincerely
believed
to
be
the
lost
son
and
heir
of
some
illustrious
personage
---
an
impression
which
was
resolved
into
an
unchangeable
conviction
on
our
infant
mind
,
by
the
subject
of
our
speculations
informing
us
,
one
day
,
in
reply
to
our
question
,
propounded
a
few
moments
before
his
ascent
to
the
summit
of
the
kitchen
chimney
,
"
that
he
believed
he
'd
been
born
in
the
vurkis
,
but
he
'd
never
know'd
his
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
felt
certain
,
from
that
time
forth
,
that
he
would
one
day
be
owned
by
a
lord
:
 
and
we
never
heard
the
church
-
bells
ring
,
or
saw
a
flag
hoisted
in
the
neighbourhood
,
without
thinking
that
the
happy
event
had
at
last
occurred
,
and
that
his
long
-
lost
parent
had
arrived
in
a
coach
and
six
,
to
take
him
home
to
Grosvenor
-
square
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
came
,
however
;
and
,
at
the
present
moment
,
the
young
gentleman
in
question
is
settled
down
as
a
master
sweep
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Battle
-
bridge
,
his
distinguishing
characteristics
being
a
decided
antipathy
to
washing
himself
,
and
the
possession
of
a
pair
of
legs
very
inadequate
to
the
support
of
his
unwieldy
and
corpulent
body
.
   
<EOS>
The
romance
of
spring
having
gone
out
before
our
time
,
we
were
fain
to
console
ourselves
as
we
best
could
with
the
uncertainty
that
enveloped
the
birth
and
parentage
of
its
attendant
dancers
,
the
sweeps
;
and
we
DID
console
ourselves
with
it
,
for
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
even
this
wicked
source
of
comfort
received
a
shock
from
which
it
has
never
recovered
---
a
shock
which
has
been
in
reality
its
death
-
blow
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
disguise
from
ourselves
the
fact
that
whole
families
of
sweeps
were
regularly
born
of
sweeps
,
in
the
rural
districts
of
Somers
Town
and
Camden
Town
---
that
the
eldest
son
succeeded
to
the
father
's
business
,
that
the
other
branches
assisted
him
therein
,
and
commenced
on
their
own
account
;
that
their
children
again
,
were
educated
to
the
profession
;
and
that
about
their
identity
there
could
be
no
mistake
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
be
blind
,
we
say
,
to
this
melancholy
truth
,
but
we
could
not
bring
ourselves
to
admit
it
,
nevertheless
,
and
we
lived
on
for
some
years
in
a
state
of
voluntary
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
roused
from
our
pleasant
slumber
by
certain
dark
insinuations
thrown
out
by
a
friend
of
ours
,
to
the
effect
that
children
in
the
lower
ranks
of
life
were
beginning
to
CHOOSE
chimney
-
sweeping
as
their
particular
walk
;
that
applications
had
been
made
by
various
boys
to
the
constituted
authorities
,
to
allow
them
to
pursue
the
object
of
their
ambition
with
the
full
concurrence
and
sanction
of
the
law
;
that
the
affair
,
in
short
,
was
becoming
one
of
mere
legal
contract
.
<EOS>
We
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
these
rumours
at
first
,
but
slowly
and
surely
they
stole
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
Month
after
month
,
week
after
week
,
nay
,
day
after
day
,
at
last
,
did
we
meet
with
accounts
of
similar
applications
.
 
<EOS>
The
veil
was
removed
,
all
mystery
was
at
an
end
,
and
chimney
-
sweeping
had
become
a
favourite
and
chosen
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
longer
any
occasion
to
steal
boys
;
for
boys
flock
in
crowds
to
bind
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
The
romance
of
the
trade
has
fled
,
and
the
chimney
-
sweeper
of
the
present
day
,
is
no
more
like
unto
him
of
thirty
years
ago
,
than
is
a
Fleet
-
street
pickpocket
to
a
Spanish
brigand
,
or
Paul
Pry
to
Caleb
Williams
.
   
<EOS>
This
gradual
decay
and
disuse
of
the
practice
of
leading
noble
youths
into
captivity
,
and
compelling
them
to
ascend
chimneys
,
was
a
severe
blow
,
if
we
may
so
speak
,
to
the
romance
of
chimney
-
sweeping
,
and
to
the
romance
of
spring
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
this
was
not
all
,
for
some
few
years
ago
the
dancing
on
May
-
day
began
to
decline
;
small
sweeps
were
observed
to
congregate
in
twos
or
threes
,
unsupported
by
a
"
green
,
"
with
no
"
My
Lord
"
to
act
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
,
and
no
"
My
Lady
"
to
preside
over
the
exchequer
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
companies
where
there
was
a
"
green
"
<EOS>
it
was
an
absolute
nothing
---
a
mere
sprout
---
and
the
instrumental
accompaniments
rarely
extended
beyond
the
shovels
and
a
set
of
Panpipes
,
better
known
to
the
many
,
as
a
"
mouth
-
organ
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
were
signs
of
the
times
,
portentous
omens
of
a
coming
change
;
and
what
was
the
result
which
they
shadowed
forth
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
master
sweeps
,
influenced
by
a
restless
spirit
of
innovation
,
actually
interposed
their
authority
,
in
opposition
to
the
dancing
,
and
substituted
a
dinner
---
an
anniversary
dinner
at
White
Conduit
House
---
where
clean
faces
appeared
in
lieu
of
black
ones
smeared
with
rose
pink
;
and
knee
cords
and
tops
superseded
nankeen
drawers
and
rosetted
shoes
.
   
<EOS>
Gentlemen
who
were
in
the
habit
of
riding
shy
horses
;
and
steady
-
going
people
who
have
no
vagrancy
in
their
souls
,
lauded
this
alteration
to
the
skies
,
and
the
conduct
of
the
master
sweeps
was
described
beyond
the
reach
of
praise
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
stands
the
real
fact
?
 
<EOS>
Let
any
man
deny
,
if
he
can
,
that
when
the
cloth
had
been
removed
,
fresh
pots
and
pipes
laid
upon
the
table
,
and
the
customary
loyal
and
patriotic

whose

From
this
day
,
we
date
the
total
fall
of
the
last
lingering
remnant
of
May
-
day
dancing
,
among
the
ELITE
of
the
profession
:
 
and
from
this
period
we
commence
a
new
era
in
that
portion
of
our
spring
associations
which
relates
to
the
first
of
May.
   
<EOS>
We
are
aware
that
the
unthinking
part
of
the
population
will
meet
us
here
,
with
the
assertion
,
that
dancing
on
May
-
day
still
continues
---
that
"
greens
"
are
annually
seen
to
roll
along
the
streets
---
that
youths
in
the
garb
of
clowns
,
precede
them
,
giving
vent
to
the
ebullitions
of
their
sportive
fancies
;
and
that
lords
and
ladies
follow
in
their
wake
.
   
<EOS>
Granted
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
ready
to
acknowledge
that
in
outward
show
,
these
processions
have
greatly
improved
:
 
<EOS>
we
do
not
deny
the
introduction
of
solos
on
the
drum
;
we
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
admit
an
occasional
fantasia
on
the
triangle
,
but
here
our
admissions
end
.
<EOS>
We
positively
deny
that
the
sweeps
have
art
or
part
in
these
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
We
distinctly
charge
the
dustmen
with
throwing
what
they
ought
to
clear
away
,
into
the
eyes
of
the
public
.
 
<EOS>
We
accuse
scavengers
,
brickmakers
,
and
gentlemen
who
devote
their
energies
to
the
costermongering
line
,
with
obtaining
money
once
a
-
year
,
under
false
pretences
.
 
<EOS>
We
cling
with
peculiar
fondness
to
the
custom
of
days
gone
by
,
and
have
shut
out
conviction
as
long
as
we
could
,
but
it
has
forced
itself
upon
us
;
and
we
now
proclaim
to
a
deluded
public
,
that
the
May
-
day
dancers
are
NOT
sweeps
.
 
<EOS>
The
size
of
them
,
alone
,
is
sufficient
to
repudiate
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
notorious
fact
that
the
widely
-
spread
taste
for
register
-
stoves
has
materially
increased
the
demand
for
small
boys
;
whereas
the
men
,
who
,
under
a
fictitious
character
,
dance
about
the
streets
on
the
first
of
May
nowadays
,
would
be
a
tight
fit
in
a
kitchen
flue
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
strong
presumptive
evidence
,
but
we
have
positive
proof
---
the
evidence
of
our
own
senses
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
is
our
testimony
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
the
morning
of
the
second
of
the
merry
month
of
May
,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
-
six
,
we
went
out
for
a
stroll
,
with
a
kind
of
forlorn
hope
of
seeing
something
or
other
which
might
induce
us
to
believe
that
it
was
really
spring
,
and
not
Christmas
.
 
<EOS>
After
wandering
as
far
as
Copenhagen
House
,
without
meeting
anything
calculated
to
dispel
our
impression
that
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
almanacks
,
we
turned
back
down
Maidenlane
,
with
the
intention
of
passing
through
the
extensive
colony
lying
between
it
and
Battle
-
bridge
,
which
is
inhabited
by
proprietors
of
donkey
-
carts
,
boilers
of
horse
-
flesh
,
makers
of
tiles
,
and
sifters
of
cinders
;
through
which
colony
we
should
have
passed
,
without
stoppage
or
interruption
,
if
a
little
crowd
gathered
round
a
shed
had
not
attracted
our
attention
,
and
induced
us
to
pause
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
say
a
"
shed
,
"
we
do
not
mean
the
conservatory
sort
of
building
,
which
,
according
to
the
old
song
,
Love
tenanted
when
he
was
a
young
man
,
but
a
wooden
house
with
windows
stuffed
with
rags
and
paper
,
and
a
small
yard
at
the
side
,
with
one
dust
-
cart
,
two
baskets
,
a
few
shovels
,
and
little
heaps
of
cinders
,
and
fragments
of
china
and
tiles
,
scattered
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Before
this
inviting
spot
we
paused
;
and
the
longer
we
looked
,
the
more
we
wondered
what
exciting
circumstance
it
could
be
,
that
induced
the
foremost
members
of
the
crowd
to
flatten
their
noses
against
the
parlour
window
,
in
the
vain
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
what
was
going
on
inside
.
 
<EOS>
After
staring
vacantly
about
us
for
some
minutes
,
we
appealed
,
touching
the
cause
of
this
assemblage
,
to
a
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
tarpaulin
,
who
was
smoking
his
pipe
on
our
right
hand
;
but
as
the
only
answer
we
obtained
was
a
playful
inquiry
whether
our
mother
had
disposed
of
her
mangle
,
we
determined
to
await
the
issue
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
Judge
of
our
virtuous
indignation
,
when
the
street
-
door
of
the
shed
opened
,
and
a
party
emerged
therefrom
,
clad
in
the
costume
and
emulating
the
appearance
,
of
May
-
day
sweeps
!
   
<EOS>
The
first
person
who
appeared
was
"
my
lord
,
"
habited
in
a
blue
coat
and
bright
buttons
,
with
gilt
paper
tacked
over
the
seams
,
yellow
knee
-
breeches
,
pink
cotton
stockings
,
and
shoes
;
a
cocked
hat
,
ornamented
with
shreds
of
various
-
coloured
paper
,
on
his
head
,
a
BOUQUET
the
size
of
a
prize
cauliflower
in
his
button
-
hole
,
a
long
Belcher
handkerchief
in
his
right
hand
,
and
a
thin
cane
in
his
left
.
 
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
applause
ran
through
the
crowd
(
which
was
chiefly
composed
of
his
lordship
's
personal
friends
)
,
when
this
graceful
figure
made
his
appearance
,
which
swelled
into
a
burst
of
applause
as
his
fair
partner
in
the
dance
bounded
forth
to
join
him
.
 
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
was
attired
in
pink
crape
over
bed
-
furniture
,
with
a
low
body
and
short
sleeves
.
 
<EOS>
The
symmetry
of
her
ankles
was
partially
concealed
by
a
very
perceptible
pair
of
frilled
trousers
;
and
the
inconvenience
which
might
have
resulted
from
the
circumstance
of
her
white
satin
shoes
being
a
few
sizes
too
large
,
was
obviated
by
their
being
firmly
attached
to
her
legs
with
strong
tape
sandals
.
   
<EOS>
Her
head
was
ornamented
with
a
profusion
of
artificial
flowers
;
and
in
her
hand
she
bore
a
large
brass
ladle
,
wherein
to
receive
what
she
figuratively
denominated
"
the
tin
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
other
characters
were
a
young
gentleman
in
girl
's
clothes
and
a
widow
's
cap
;
two
clowns
who
walked
upon
their
hands
in
the
mud
,
to
the
immeasurable
delight
of
all
the
spectators
;
a
man
with
a
drum
;
another
man
with
a
flageolet
;
a
dirty
woman
in
a
large
shawl
,
with
a
box
under
her
arm
for
the
money
,
---
and
last
,
though
not
least
,
the
"
green
,
"
animated
by
no
less
a
personage
than
our
identical
friend
in
the
tarpaulin
suit
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
hammered
away
at
the
drum
,
the
flageolet
squeaked
,
the
shovels
rattled
,
the
"
green
"
rolled
about
,
pitching
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
;
my
lady
threw
her
right
foot
over
her
left
ankle
,
and
her
left
foot
over
her
right
ankle
,
alternately
;
my
lord
ran
a
few
paces
forward
,
and
butted
at
the
"
green
,
"
and
then
a
few
paces
backward
upon
the
toes
of
the
crowd
,
and
then
went
to
the
right
,
and
then
to
the
left
,
and
then
dodged
my
lady
round
the
"
green
;
"
and
finally
drew
her
arm
through
his
,
and
called
upon
the
boys
to
shout
,
which
they
did
lustily
---
for
this
was
the
dancing
.
   
<EOS>
We
passed
the
same
group
,
accidentally
,
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
saw
a
"
green
"
so
drunk
,
a
lord
so
quarrelsome
(
no
:
 
not
even
in
the
house
of
peers
after
dinner
)
,
a
pair
of
clowns
so
melancholy
,
a
lady
<EOS>
so
muddy
,
or
a
party
<EOS>
so
miserable
.
   
<EOS>
How
has
May

<EOS>
Brokers
'
and
marine
-
store
shops
<EOS>
When
we
affirm
that
brokers
'
shops
are
strange
places
,
and
that
if
an
authentic
history
of
their
contents
could
be
procured
,
it
would
furnish
many
a
page
of
amusement
,
and
many
a
melancholy
tale
,
it
is
necessary
to
explain
the
class
of
shops
to
which
we
allude
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
when
we
make
use
of
the
term
"
Brokers
'
Shop
,
"
the
minds
of
our
readers
will
at
once
picture
large
,
handsome
warehouses
,
exhibiting
a
long
perspective
of
French
-
polished
dining
-
tables
,
rosewood
chiffoniers
,
and
mahogany
wash
-
hand
-
stands
,
with
an
occasional
vista
of
a
four
-
post
bedstead
and
hangings
,
and
an
appropriate
foreground
of
dining
-
room
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
will
imagine
that
we
mean
an
humble
class
of
second
-
hand
furniture
repositories
.
 
<EOS>
Their
imagination
will
then
naturally
lead
them
to
that
street
at
the
back
of
Long
-
acre
,
which
is
composed
almost
entirely
of
brokers
'
shops
;
where
you
walk
through
groves
of
deceitful
,
showy
-
looking
furniture
,
and
where
the
prospect
is
occasionally
enlivened
by
a
bright
red
,
blue
,
and
yellow
hearth
-
rug
,
embellished
with
the
pleasing
device
of
a
mail
-
coach
at
full
speed
,
or
a
strange
animal
,
supposed
to
have
been
originally
intended
for
a
dog
,
with
a
mass
of
worsted
-
work
in
his
mouth
,
which
conjecture
has
likened
to
a
basket
of
flowers
.
   
<EOS>
This
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
is
a
tempting
article
to
young
wives
in
the
humbler
ranks
of
life
,
who
have
a
first
-
floor
front
to
furnish
---
they
are
lost
in
admiration
,
and
hardly
know
which
to
admire
most
.
<EOS>
The
dog
is
very
beautiful
,
but
they
have
a
dog
already
on
the
best
tea
-
tray
,
and
two
more
on
the
mantel
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
is
something
so
genteel
about
that
mail
-
coach
;
and
the
passengers
outside
(
who
are
all
hat
)
give
it
such
an
air
of
reality
!
   
<EOS>
The
goods
here
are
adapted
to
the
taste
,
or
rather
to
the
means
,
of
cheap
purchasers
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
some
of
the
most
beautiful
LOOKING
Pembroke
tables
that
were
ever
beheld
:
 
the
wood
as
green
as
the
trees
in
the
Park
,
and
the
leaves
almost
as
certain
to
fall
off
in
the
course
of
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
also
a
most
extensive
assortment
of
tent
and
turn
-
up
bedsteads
,
made
of
stained
wood
,
and
innumerable
specimens
of
that
base
imposition
on
society
---
a
sofa
bedstead
.
   
<EOS>
A
turn
-
up
bedstead
is
a
blunt
,
honest
piece
of
furniture
;
it
may
be
slightly
disguised
with
a
sham
drawer
;
and
sometimes
a
mad
attempt
is
even
made
to
pass
it
off
for
a
book
-
case
;
ornament
it
as
you
will
,
however
,
the
turn
-
up
bedstead
seems
to
defy
disguise
,
and
to
insist
on
having
it
distinctly
understood
that
he
is
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
,
and
nothing
else
---
that
he
is
indispensably
necessary
,
and
that
being
so
useful
,
he
disdains
to
be
ornamental
.
   
<EOS>
How
different
is
the
demeanour
of
a
sofa
bedstead
!
 
<EOS>
Ashamed
of
its
real
use
,
it
strives
to
appear
an
article
of
luxury
and
gentility
---
an
attempt
in
which
it
miserably
fails
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
neither
the
respectability
of
a
sofa
,
nor
the
virtues
of
a
bed
;
every
man
who
keeps
a
sofa
bedstead
in
his
house
,
becomes
a
party
to
a
wilful
and
designing
fraud
---
we
question
whether
you
could
insult
him
more
,
than
by
insinuating
that
you
entertain
the
least
suspicion
of
its
real
use
.
   
<EOS>
To
return
from
this
digression
,
we
beg
to
say
,
that
neither
of
these
classes
of
brokers
'
shops
,
forms
the
subject
of
this
sketch
.
<EOS>
The
shops
to
which
we
advert
,
are
immeasurably
inferior
to
those
on
whose
outward
appearance
we
have
slightly
touched
.
 
<EOS>
Our
readers
must
often
have
observed
in
some
by
-
street
,
in
a
poor
neighbourhood
,
a
small
dirty
shop
,
exposing
for
sale
the
most
extraordinary
and
confused
jumble
of
old
,
worn
-
out
,
wretched
articles
,
that
can
well
be
imagined
.
 
<EOS>
Our
wonder
at
their
ever
having
been
bought
,
is
only
to
be
equalled
by
our
astonishment
at
the
idea
of
their
ever
being
sold
again
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
board
,
at
the
side
of
the
door
,
are
placed
about
twenty
books
---
all
odd
volumes
;
and
as
many
wine
-
glasses
---
all
different
patterns
;
several
locks
,
an
old
earthenware
pan
,
full
of
rusty
keys
;
two
or
three
gaudy
chimney
-
ornaments
---
cracked
,
of
course
;
the
remains
of
a
lustre
,
without
any
drops
;
a
round
frame
like
a
capital
O
,
which
has
once
held
a
mirror
;
a
flute
,
complete
with
the
exception
of
the
middle
joint
;
a
pair
of
curling
-
irons
;
and
a
tinder
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
In
front
of
the
shop
-
window
,
are
ranged
some
half
-
dozen
high
-
backed
chairs
,
with
spinal
complaints
and
wasted
legs
;
a
corner
cupboard
;
two
or
three
very
dark
mahogany
tables
with
flaps
like
mathematical
problems
;
some
pickle
-
jars
,
some
surgeons
'
ditto
,
with
gilt
labels
and
without
stoppers
;
an
unframed
portrait
of
some
lady
who
flourished
about
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
,
by
an
artist
who
never
flourished
at
all
;
an
incalculable
host
of
miscellanies
of
every
description
,
including
bottles
and
cabinets
,
rags
and
bones
,
fenders
and
street
-
door
knockers
,
fire
-
irons
,
wearing
apparel
and
bedding
,
a
hall
-
lamp
,
and
a
room

door
.
 
<EOS>
Imagine
,
in
addition
to
this
incongruous
mass
,
a
black
doll
in
a
white
frock
,
with
two
faces
---
one
looking
up
the
street
,
and
the
other
looking
down
,
swinging
over
the
door
;
a
board
with
the
squeezed
-
up
inscription
"
Dealer
in
marine
stores
,
"
in
lanky
white
letters
,
whose
height
is
strangely
out
of
proportion
to
their
width
;
and
you
have
before
you
precisely
the
kind
of
shop
to
which
we
wish
to
direct
your
attention
.
   
<EOS>
Although
the
same
heterogeneous
mixture
of
things
will
be
found
at
all
these
places
,
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
truly
and
accurately
some
of
the
minor
articles
which
are
exposed
for
sale
---
articles
of
wearing
apparel
,
for
instance
---
mark
the
character
of
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Take
Drury
-
Lane
and
Covent
-
garden
for
example
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
essentially
a
theatrical
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
potboy
in
the
vicinity
who
is
not
,
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
,
a
dramatic
character
.
 
<EOS>
The
errand
-
boys
and
chandler's
-
shop
-
keepers
'
sons
,
are
all
stage
-
struck
:
 
<EOS>
they
"
gets
up
"
plays
in
back
kitchens
hired
for
the
purpose
,
and
will
stand
before
a
shop
-
window
for
hours
,
contemplating
a
great
staring
portrait
of
Mr
Somebody
or
other
,
of
the
Royal
Coburg
Theatre
,
"
as
he
appeared
in
the
character
of
Tongo
the
Denounced

"
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
is
,
that
there
is
not
a
marine
-
store
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
,
which
does
not
exhibit
for
sale
some
faded
articles
of
dramatic
finery
,
such
as
three
or
four
pairs
of
soiled
buff
boots
with
turn
-
over
red
tops
,
heretofore
worn
by
a
"
fourth
robber
,
"
or
"
fifth
mob
;
"
a
pair
of
rusty
broadswords
,
a
few
gauntlets
,
and
certain
resplendent
ornaments
,
which
,
if
they
were
yellow
instead
of
white
,
might
be
taken
for
insurance
plates
of
the
Sun
Fire

office

<EOS>
There
are
several
of
these
shops
in
the
narrow
streets
and
dirty
courts
,
of
which
there
are
so
many
near
the
national
theatres
,
and
they
all
have
tempting
goods
of
this
description
,
with
the
addition
,
perhaps
,
of
a
lady
's
pink
dress
covered
with
spangles
;
white
wreaths
,
stage
shoes
,
and
a
tiara
like
a
tin
lamp
reflector
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
been
purchased
of
some
wretched
supernumeraries
,
or
sixth
-
rate
actors
,
and
are
now
offered
for
the
benefit
of
the
rising
generation
,
who
,
on
condition
of
making
certain
weekly
payments
,
amounting
in
the
whole
to
about
ten
times
their
value
,
may
avail
themselves
of
such
desirable
bargains
.
   
<EOS>
Let
us
take
a
very
different
quarter
,
and
apply
it
to
the
same
test
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
a
marine
-
store
dealer
's
,
in
that
reservoir
of
dirt
,
drunkenness
,
and
drabs
:
 
thieves
,
oysters
,
baked
potatoes
,
and
pickled
salmon
---
Ratcliff
-
highway
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
the
wearing
apparel
is
all
nautical
.
 
<EOS>
Rough
blue
jackets
,
with
mother
-
of
-
pearl
buttons
,
oil
-
skin
hats
,
coarse
checked
shirts
,
and
large
canvas
trousers
that
look
as
if
they
were
made
for
a
pair
of
bodies
instead
of
a
pair
of
legs
,
are
the
staple
commodities
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
are
large
bunches
of
cotton
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
in
colour
and
pattern
unlike
any
one
ever
saw
before
,
with
the
exception
of
those
on
the
backs
of
the
three
young
ladies
without
bonnets
who
passed
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
The
furniture
is
much
the
same
as
elsewhere
,
with
the
addition
of
one
or
two
models
of
ships
,
and
some
old
prints
of
naval
engagements
in
still
older
frames
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
window
,
are
a
few
compasses
,
a
small
tray
containing
silver
watches
in
clumsy
thick
cases
;
and
tobacco
-
boxes
,
the
lid
of
each
ornamented
with
a
ship
,
or
an
anchor
,
or
some
such
trophy

<EOS>
A
sailor
generally
pawns
or
sells
all
he
has
before
he
has
been
long
ashore
,
and
if
he
does
not
,
some
favoured
companion
kindly
saves
him
the
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
In
either
case
,
it
is
an
even
chance
that
he
afterwards
unconsciously
repurchases
the
same
things
at
a
higher
price
than
he
gave
for
them
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
Again
:
 
pay
a
visit
with
a
similar
object
,
to
a
part
of
London
,
as
unlike
both
of
these
as
they
are
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Cross
over
to
the
Surrey
side
,
and
look
at
such
shops
of
this
description

are
to
be
found
near
the
King

Bench
prison
,
and
in
"
the

<EOS>
How
different
,
and
how
strikingly
illustrative
of
the
decay
of
some
of
the
unfortunate
residents
in
this
part
of
the
metropolis
!
<EOS>
Imprisonment
and
neglect
have
done
their
work
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
contamination
in
the
profligate
denizens
of
a
debtor
's
prison
;
old
friends
have
fallen
off
;
the
recollection
of
former
prosperity
has
passed
away
;
and
with
it
all
thoughts
for
the
past
,
all
care
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
watches
and
rings
,
then
cloaks
,
coats
,
and
all
the
more
expensive
articles
of
dress
,
have
found
their
way
to
the
pawnbroker
's
.
 
<EOS>
That
miserable
resource
has
failed
at
last
,
and
the
sale
of
some
trifling
article
at
one
of
these
shops
,
has
been
the
only
mode
left
of
raising
a
shilling
or
two
,
to
meet
the
urgent
demands
of
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Dressing
-
cases
and
writing
-
desks
,
too
old
to
pawn
but
too
good
to
keep
;
guns
,
fishing
-
rods
,
musical
instruments
,
all
in
the
same
condition
;
have
first
been
sold
,
and
the
sacrifice
has
been
but
slightly
felt
.
 
<EOS>
But
hunger
must
be
allayed
,
and
what
has
already
become
a
habit
<EOS>
,
is
easily
resorted
to
,
when
an
emergency
arises
.
 
<EOS>
Light
articles
of
clothing
,
first
of
the
ruined
man
,
then
of
his
wife
,
at
last
of
their
children
,
even
of
the
youngest
,
have
been
parted
with
,
piecemeal
.
 
<EOS>
There
they
are
,
thrown
carelessly
together
until
a
purchaser
presents
himself
,
old
,
and
patched
and
repaired
,
it
is
true
;
but
the
make
and
materials
tell
of
better
days
;
and
the
older
they
are
,
the
greater
the
misery
and
destitution
of
those
whom
they
once
adorned

Gin
-
shops
<EOS>
It
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
,
that
different
trades
appear
to
partake
of
the
disease
to
which
elephants
and
dogs
are
especially
liable
,
and
to
run
stark
,
staring
,
raving
mad
,
periodically
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
distinction
between
the
animals
and
the
trades
,
is
,
that
the
former
run
mad
with
a
certain
degree
of
propriety
---
they
are
very
regular
in
their
irregularities
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
the
period
at
which
the
emergency
will
arise
,
and
provide
against
it
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
If
an
elephant
run
mad
,
we
are
all
ready
for
him
---
kill
or
cure
---
pills
or
bullets
,
calomel
in
conserve
of
roses
,
or
lead
in
a
musket
-
barrel
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
dog
happen
to
look
unpleasantly
warm
in
the
summer
months
,
and
to
trot
about
the
shady
side
of
the
streets
with
a
quarter
of
a
yard
of
tongue
hanging
out
of
his
mouth
,
a
thick
leather
muzzle
,
which
has
been
previously
prepared
in
compliance
with
the
thoughtful
injunctions
of
the
Legislature
,
is
instantly
clapped
over
his
head
,
by
way
of
making
him
cooler
,
and
he
either
looks
remarkably
unhappy
for
the
next
six
weeks
,
or
becomes
legally
insane
,
and
goes
mad
,
as
it
were
,
by
Act
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
trades
are
as
eccentric
as
comets
;
nay
,
worse
,
for
no
one
can
calculate
on
the
recurrence
of
the
strange
appearances
which
betoken
the
disease
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
contagion
is
general
,
and
the
quickness
with
which
it
diffuses
itself
,
almost
incredible
.
   
<EOS>
We
will
cite
two
or
three
cases
in
illustration
of
our
meaning
.
<EOS>
Six
or
eight
years
ago
,
the
epidemic
began
to
display
itself
among
the
linen
-
drapers
and
haberdashers
.
 
<EOS>
The
primary
symptoms
were
an
inordinate
love
of
plate
-
glass
,
and
a
passion
for
gas
-
lights
and
gilding
.
 
<EOS>
The
disease
gradually
progressed
,
and
at
last
attained
a
fearful
height
.
 
<EOS>
Quiet
,
dusty
old
shops
in
different
parts
of
town
,
were
pulled
down
;
spacious
premises
with
stuccoed
fronts
and
gold
letters
,
were
erected
instead
;
floors
were
covered
with
Turkey
carpets
;
roofs
supported
by
massive
pillars
;
doors
knocked
into
windows
;
a
dozen
squares
of
glass
into
one
;
one
shopman
into
a
dozen
;
and
there
is
no
knowing
what
would
have
been
done
,
if
it
had
not
been
fortunately
discovered
,
just
in
time
,
that
the
Commissioners
of
Bankruptcy
were
as
competent
to
decide
such
cases
as
the
Commissioners
of
Lunacy
,
and
that
a
little
confinement
and
gentle
examination
did
wonders
.
 
<EOS>
The
disease
abated
.
 
<EOS>
It
died
away
.
<EOS>
A
year
or
two
of
comparative
tranquillity
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
it
burst
out
again
amongst
the
chemists
;
the
symptoms
were
the
same
,
with
the
addition
of
a
strong
desire
to
stick
the
royal
arms
over
the
shop
-
door
,
and
a
great
rage
for
mahogany
,
varnish
,
and
expensive
floor
-
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
hosiers
were
infected
,
and
began
to
pull
down
their
shop
-
fronts
with
frantic
recklessness
.
 
<EOS>
The
mania
again
died
away
,
and
the
public
began
to
congratulate
themselves
on
its
entire
disappearance
,
when
it
burst
forth
with
tenfold
violence
among
the
publicans
,
and
keepers
of
"
wine
vaults
.
"
<EOS>
From
that
moment
it
has
spread
among
them
with
unprecedented
rapidity
,
exhibiting
a
concatenation
of
all
the
previous
symptoms
;
onward
it
has
rushed
to
every
part
of
town
,
knocking
down
all
the
old
public
-
houses
,
and
depositing
splendid
mansions
,
stone
balustrades
,
rosewood
fittings
,
immense
lamps
,
and
illuminated
clocks
,
at
the
corner
of
every
street
.
   
<EOS>
The
extensive
scale
on
which
these
places
are
established
,
and
the
ostentatious
manner
in
which
the
business
of
even
the
smallest
among
them
is
divided
into
branches
,
is
amusing
.
 
<EOS>
A
handsome
plate
of
ground
glass
in
one
door
directs
you
"
To
the
Counting

house
;
"
another
to
the
"
Bottle
Department
;
a
third
to
the
"
Wholesale
Department
;
"
a
fourth
to
"
The
Wine
Promenade
;
"
and
so
forth
,
until
we
are
in
daily
expectation
of
meeting
with
a
"
Brandy
Bell
,
"
or
a
"
Whiskey
Entrance

Then
,
ingenuity
is
exhausted
in
devising
attractive
titles
for
the
different
descriptions

the

gaze

the
gigantic

which

Although

We

the

make
for
Drury

The

The
hum

many
voices
issues
from
that
splendid
gin
-
shop
which
forms
the
commencement
of

fantastically
ornamented

surrounded
by
stucco
rosettes

and
its
profusion
of

is
perfectly
dazzling
when
contrasted
with
the
darkness
and
dirt
<EOS>
we
have
just
left

The
interior
is
even
gayer

the
exterior

<EOS>
A
bar
of
French
-
polished
mahogany
,
elegantly
carved
,
extends
the
whole
width
of
the
place
;
and
there
are
two
side
-
aisles
of
great
casks
,
painted
green
and
gold
,
enclosed
within
a
light
brass
rail
,
and
bearing
such
inscriptions
,
as
"
Old

549
;
"
"
Young
Tom
,
360
;
"
"
Samson

the
figures
agreeing

we

,
with

understood

<EOS>
Beyond
the
bar
is
a
lofty
and
spacious
saloon
,
full
of
the
same
enticing
vessels
,
with
a
gallery
running
round
it
,
equally
well
furnished
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
counter
,
in
addition
to
the
usual
spirit
apparatus
,
are
two
or
three
little
baskets
of
cakes
and
biscuits
,
which
are
carefully
secured
at
top
with
wicker
-
work
,
to
prevent
their
contents
being
unlawfully
abstracted
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
it
,
are
two
showily
-
dressed
damsels
with
large
necklaces
,
dispensing
the
spirits
and
"
compounds
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
are
assisted
by
the
ostensible
proprietor
of
the
concern
,
a
stout
,
coarse
fellow
in
a
fur
cap
,
put
on
very
much
on
one
side
to
give
him
a
knowing
air
,
and
to
display
his
sandy
whiskers
to
the
best
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
old
washerwomen
,
who
are
seated
on
the
little
bench
to
the
left
of
the
bar
,
are
rather
overcome
by
the
head
-
dresses
and
haughty
demeanour
of
the
young
ladies
who
officiate
.
 
<EOS>
They
receive
their
half
-
quartern
of
gin
and
peppermint
,
with
considerable
deference
,
prefacing
a
request
for
"
one

soft

"
with
a
"
Jist

good

,
ma'am

<EOS>
They
are
quite
astonished
at
the
impudent
air
of
the
young
fellow
in
a
brown
coat
and
bright
buttons
,
who
,
ushering
in
his
two
companions
,
and
walking
up
to
the
bar
in
as
careless
a
manner
as
if
he
had
been
used
to
green
and
gold
ornaments
all
his
life
,
winks
at
one
of
the
young
ladies
with
singular
coolness
,
and
calls
for
a
"
kervorten
and
a
three
-
out

glass
,
"
just
as
if
the
place
were
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gin
for
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
says
the
young
lady
when
she
has
drawn
it
:
 
carefully
looking
every
way
<EOS>
but
the
right
one
,
to
show
that
the
wink
had
no
effect
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
me
,
Mary
,
my
dear
,
"
replies
the
gentleman
in
brown
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
name
an't
Mary
as
it
happens
,
"
says
the
young
girl
,
rather
relaxing
as
she
delivers
the
change
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
it
an't
,
it
ought
to
be
,
"
responds
the
irresistible
one
;
"
all
the
Marys
as
ever
I
see
,
was
handsome
gals
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
young
lady
,
not
precisely
remembering
how
blushes
are
managed
in
such
cases
,
abruptly
ends
the
flirtation
by
addressing
the
female
in
the
faded
feathers
who
has
just
entered
,
and
who
,
after
stating
explicitly
,
to
prevent
any
subsequent
misunderstanding
,
that
"
this
gentleman
pays
,
"
calls
for
"
a
glass
of
port
wine

a
bit

Those
two
old
men
who
came
in
"
just
to
have
a
drain

"
finished
their
third
quartern
a
few
seconds
ago
;
they
have
made
themselves
crying
drunk

the
fat
comfortable
-
looking
elderly
women
,
who
had
"
a
glass
of
rum

srub
"
each
,
having
chimed
in
with
their
complaints
on
the
hardness
of
the
times
,
one
of
the
women
has
agreed
to
stand
a
glass
round
,
jocularly
observing
that
"
grief
never
mended
no
broken
bones
,
and
as
good
people
's
wery
scarce
,
what
I
says
is
,
make
the
most

and
that

all
about
it

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
sentiment
which
appears
to
afford
unlimited
satisfaction
to
those
who
have
nothing
to
pay

<EOS>
It
is
growing
late

and
the
throng
of
men

women

and
children

who
have
been
constantly
going
in

out

dwindles
down
to
two

three
occasional

cold

wretched

looking

emaciation

The
knot
of
Irish
labourers
at
the
lower
end

who
have
been
alternately
shaking
hands
with

and
threatening
the
life
of
each
other

for
the
last
hour

become
furious
in
their
disputes
,
and
finding
it
impossible
to
silence
one
man
,
who
is
particularly
anxious
to
adjust
the
difference
,
they
resort
to
the
expedient
of
knocking
him
down

jumping
on
him
afterwards

The
man
in
the
fur
cap

and
the
potboy
rush
out

a
scene
of
riot
and
confusion
ensues

half
the
Irishmen
get
shut
out
,
and
the
other
half
get
shut
in

potboy
is
knocked
among

everybody
hits

shouting

Some

borne
off

slink
home

beat

complaining

kick

daring

We
have
sketched
this
subject
very
slightly
,
not
only
because
our
limits
compel
us
to
do
so

because

if
it

pursued
farther

it
would
be
painful

repulsive

Well

disposed

charitable

would
alike
turn
with
coldness
and
disgust
from
a
description

the
drunken
besotted
men
,
and
wretched
broken
-
down
miserable
women
,
who
form
no
inconsiderable
portion
of

frequenters
of
these

forgetting

in

pleasant

the

Gin
-
drinking
is
a
great
vice
in
England

but
wretchedness

dirt
are
a
greater

and
until
you
improve
the
homes
of

or
persuade
a
half

famished
wretch
not
to
seek
relief
in
the
temporary
oblivion
of
his
own
misery

with
the
pittance
which
,
divided
among
his
family

would
furnish

The
pawnbroker
's
shop
Of
the
numerous
receptacles
for
misery
and
distress
with
which
the
streets
of
London
unhappily
abound
,
there
are
,
perhaps
,
none
which
present
such
striking
scenes
as
the
pawnbrokers
'
shops

<EOS>
The
very
nature
and
description
of
these
places
occasions
their
being
but
little
known
,
except
to
the
unfortunate
beings
whose
profligacy
or
misfortune
drives
them
to
seek
the
temporary
relief
they
offer
.
<EOS>
The
subject
may
appear
,
at
first
sight
,
to
be
anything
but
an
inviting
one
,
but
we
venture
on
it
nevertheless
,
in
the
hope
that
,
as
far
as
the
limits
of
our
present
paper
are
concerned
,
it
will
present
nothing
to
disgust
even
the
most
fastidious
reader

<EOS>
There
are
some
pawnbrokers
'
shops
of
a
very
superior
description
.
<EOS>
There
are
grades
in
pawning
as
in
everything
else

and
distinctions
must
be
observed

The
aristocratic
Spanish
cloak

the
plebeian
calico
shirt
,
the
silver
fork
and
the
flat
iron
,
the
muslin
cravat
and
the
Belcher
neckerchief
,
would
but
ill
assort
together
;
so
,
the
better
sort
of
pawnbroker
calls
himself
a
silver
-
smith
,
and
decorates
his
shop
with
handsome
trinkets
and
expensive
jewellery
,
while
the
more
humble
money
-
lender
boldly
advertises
his
calling
,
and
invites
observation
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
with
pawnbrokers
'
shops
of
the
latter
class
,
that
we
have
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
selected
one
for
our
purpose
,
and
will
endeavour
to
describe
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
pawnbroker
's
shop
is
situated
near
Drury
-
Lane
,
at
the
corner
of
a
court
,
which
affords
a
side
entrance
for
the
accommodation
of
such
customers
as
may
be
desirous
of
avoiding
the
observation
of
the
passers
-
by
,
or
the
chance
of
recognition
in
the
public
street
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
low
,
dirty
-
looking
,
dusty
shop
,
the
door
of
which
stands
always
doubtfully
,
a
little
way
open
:
 
half
inviting
,
half
repelling
the
hesitating
visitor
,
who
,
if
he
be
as
yet
uninitiated
,
examines
one
of
the
old
garnet
brooches
in
the
window
for
a
minute
or
two
with
affected
eagerness
,
as
if
he
contemplated
making
a
purchase
;
and
then
looking
cautiously
round
to
ascertain
that
no
one
watches
him
,
hastily
slinks
in
:
 
the
door
closing
of
itself
after
him
,
to
just
its
former
width
.
 
<EOS>
The
shop
front
and
the
window
-
frames
bear
evident
marks
of
having
been
once
painted
;
but
,
what
the
colour
was
originally
,
or
at
what
date
it
was
probably
laid
on
,
are
at
this
remote
period
questions
which
may
be
asked
,
but
can
not
be
answered
.
 
<EOS>
Tradition
states
that
the
transparency
in
the
front
door
,
which
displays
at
night
three
red
balls
on
a
blue
ground
,
once
bore
also
,
inscribed
in
graceful
waves
,
the
words
"
Money
advanced
on
plate
,
jewels
,
wearing
apparel
,
and
every
description
of
property

"
but
a
few
illegible
hieroglyphics
are
all
that
now
remain
to
attest
the
fact
.

The
plate
and
jewels
would
seem
to
have
disappeared

together
with
the
announcement
,
for
the
articles
of
stock
,
which
are
displayed
in
some
profusion
in
the
window

do
not

any
very
valuable

each
boor

painfully

way

expressing
his

,
straggling
,
shrunken
,
and
rotten
,
with
one
or
two
filthy
,
unwholesome
-
looking
heads
thrust
out
of
every
window
,
and
old
red
pans
and
stunted
plants
exposed
on
the
tottering
parapets
,
to
the
manifest
hazard
of
the
heads
of
the
passers

the
noisy
men
loitering
under
the
archway
at
the
corner
of
the
court
,
or
about
the
gin

shop
next
door
---
and
their
wives
patiently
standing
on
the
curb
-
stone
,
with
large
baskets
of
cheap
vegetables
slung
round
them
for
sale
,
are
its
immediate
auxiliaries
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
outside
of
the
pawnbroker
's
shop
be
calculated
to
attract
the
attention
,
or
excite
the
interest
,
of
the
speculative
pedestrian
,
its
interior
can
not
fail
to
produce
the
same
effect
in
an
increased
degree
.
 
<EOS>
The
front
door
,
which
we
have
before
noticed
,
opens
into
the
common
shop
,
which
is
the
resort
of
all
those
customers
whose
habitual
acquaintance
with
such
scenes
renders
them
indifferent
to
the
observation
of
their
companions
in
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
The
side
door
opens
into
a
small
passage
from
which
some
half
-
dozen
doors
(
which
may
be
secured
on
the
inside
by
bolts
)
open
into
a
corresponding
number
of
little
dens
,
or
closets
,
which
face
the
counter
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
the
more
timid
or
respectable
portion
of
the
crowd
shroud
themselves
from
the
notice
of
the
remainder
,
and
patiently
wait
until
the
gentleman
behind
the
counter
,
with
the
curly
black
hair
,
diamond
ring
,
and
double
silver
watch
-
guard
,
shall
feel
disposed
to
favour
them
with
his
notice
---
a
consummation
which
depends
considerably
on
the
temper
of
the
aforesaid
gentleman
for
the
time
being
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
,
this
elegantly
-
attired
individual
is
in
the
act
of
entering
the
duplicate
he
has
just
made
out
,
in
a
thick
book
:
 
a
process
from
which
he
is
diverted
occasionally
,
by
a
conversation
he
is
carrying
on
with
another
young
man
similarly
employed
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
whose
allusions
to
"
that
last
bottle
of
soda
-
water
last
night
,
"
and
"
how
regularly
round
my
hat
he
felt
himself
when
the
young
'
ooman
gave
'em
in
charge
,
"
would
appear
to
refer
to
the
consequences
of
some
stolen
joviality
of
the
preceding
evening
.
 
<EOS>
The
customers
generally
,
however
,
seem
unable
to
participate
in
the
amusement
derivable
from
this
source
,
for
an
old
sallow
-
looking
woman
,
who
has
been
leaning
with
both
arms
on
the
counter
with
a
small
bundle
before
her
,
for
half
an
hour
previously
,
suddenly
interrupts
the
conversation
by
addressing
the
 
jewelled
shopman
---
"
Now
,
Mr
Henry
,
do
make
haste
,
there
's
a
good
soul
,
for
my
two
grandchildren
's
locked
up
at
home
,
and
I
'm
afeer'd
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
shopman
slightly
raises
his
head
,
with
an
air
of
deep
abstraction
,
and
resumes
his
entry
with
as
much
deliberation
as
if
he
were
engraving
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
in
a
hurry
,
Mrs
Tatham
,
this
ev'nin
'
,
an't
you

<EOS>
"
is
the
only
notice
he
deigns
to
take
,
after
the
lapse
of
five
minutes
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
indeed
,
Mr
Henry
;

<EOS>
,
there

<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquires
the
shopman
,
unpinning
the
bundle
---
"
old
concern
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
---
pair
o

stays
and
a

<EOS>
You
must
look
up
somethin'
else
,
old

I
ca
n't
lend
you
anything
more
upon

they

three

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh

you

a

you

"
replies
the
old
woman
,
laughing
extremely
,
as
in
duty
bound
;
"
I
wish
I

got
the
gift
of
the

you

<EOS>
No

no

it
an't
the

it
's
a

and
a

He

<EOS>
---
"
What
do
you
want
upon
these
?
"
<EOS>
inquires
Mr
Henry
,
slightly
glancing
at
the
articles
,
which
in
all
probability
are
old
acquaintances
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
upon
these

"
---
"
Eighteenpence

<EOS>

"
Lend

Well

The
duplicate
is
made
out
,
one
ticket
pinned
on
the
parcel
,
the
other
given
to
the
old
woman
;
the
parcel
is
flung
carelessly
down
into
a
corner
,
and
some
other
customer
prefers
his
claim
to
be
served
without
further
delay
.
   
<EOS>
The
choice
falls
on
an
unshaven
,
dirty
,
sottish
-
looking
fellow
,
whose
tarnished
paper
-
cap
,
stuck
negligently
over
one
eye
,
communicates
an
additionally
repulsive
expression
to
his
very
uninviting
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
enjoying
a
little
relaxation
from
his
sedentary
pursuits
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
,
in
kicking
his
wife
up
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
come
to
redeem
some
tools
:
---
probably
to
complete
a
job
with
,
on
account
of
which
he
has
already
received
some
money
,
if
his
inflamed
countenance
and
drunken
staggers
may
be
taken
as
evidence
of
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Having
waited
some
little
time
,
he
makes
his
presence
known
by
venting
his
ill
-
humour
on
a
ragged
urchin
,
who
,
being
unable
to
bring
his
face
on
a
level
with
the
counter
by
any
other
process
,
has
employed
himself
in
climbing
up
,
and
then
hooking
himself
on
with
his
elbows
---
an
uneasy
perch
,
from
which
he
has
fallen
at
intervals
,
generally
alighting
on
the
toes
of
the
person
in
his
immediate
vicinity
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
present
case
,
the
unfortunate
little
wretch
has
received
a
cuff
which
sends
him
reeling
to
this
door
;
and
the
donor
of
the
blow
is
immediately
the
object
of
general
indignation
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
strike
the
boy
for
,
<EOS>
you
brute
?
<EOS>
"
exclaims
a
slipshod
woman
,
with
two
flat
irons
in
a
little
basket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
's
your
wife
,
you
willin
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
and
hang
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
replies
the
gentleman
addressed
,
with
a
drunken
look
of
savage
stupidity
,
aiming
at
the
same
time
a
blow
at
the
woman
which
fortunately
misses
its
object
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
and
hang
yourself
;
and
wait
till
I
come
and
cut
you
down
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
Cut
you
down
,
"
rejoins
the
woman
,
"
I
wish
I
had
the
cutting
of
you
up
,
you
wagabond

<EOS>
(
loud

)
 
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
you
precious
wagabond

<EOS>
(
rather
louder

)
 
<EOS>
Where
's
your
wife
,
you
willin
?
<EOS>
(
louder
still
;
women
of
this
class
are
always
sympathetic
,
and
work
themselves
into
a
tremendous
passion
on
the
shortest
notice
.

<EOS>
Your
poor
dear
wife
as
you
uses
worser
nor
a
dog
<EOS>
---
strike
a
woman
---
you
a

<EOS>
(
very
shrill
<EOS>
;
)
I
wish
I
had
you
---
I

murder
you
,
<EOS>
I
would
,
if
I
died
for
it

"
<EOS>
---
"
Now
be
civil

"
retorts
the
man
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
civil
,
you
wiper
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculates
the
woman
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
An't
it
shocking
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
continues
,
turning
round
,
and
appealing
to
an
old
woman
who
is
peeping
out
of
one
of
the
little
closets
we
have
before
described
,
and
who
has
not
the
slightest
objection
to
join
in
the
attack
,
possessing
,
as
she
does
,
the
comfortable
conviction
that
she
is
bolted
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
it
shocking
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
(
Dreadful
!
says
the
old
woman
in
a
parenthesis
,
not
exactly
knowing
what
the
question
refers
to
.
)
 
<EOS>
He
's
got
a
wife
,
ma'am
,
as
takes
in
mangling
,
and
is
as
'
dustrious
and
hard
-
working
a
young
'
ooman
as
can
be
,
(
very
fast
)
as
lives
in
the
back
parlour
of
our
'
ous
,
which
my
husband
and
me
lives
in
the
front
one
(
with
great
rapidity
)
---
and
we
hears
him
a
beaten
"
on
her
sometimes
when
he
comes
home
drunk
,
the
whole
night
through
,
and
not
only
a
beaten
"
her
,
but
beaten
"
his
own
child
too
,
to
make
her
more
miserable
---
ugh
,
you
beast
!
<EOS>
and
she
,
poor
creater
,
wo
n't
swear
the
peace
agin
him
,
nor
do
nothin'
,
because
she
likes
the
wretch
arter
all
---
worse
luck
!
"
 
<EOS>
Here
,
as
the
woman
has
completely
run
herself
out
of
breath
,
the
pawnbroker
himself
,
who
has
just
appeared
behind
the
counter
in
a
gray
dressing
-
gown
,
embraces
the
favourable
opportunity
of
putting
in
a
word
:
---
"
Now
I
wo
n't
have
none
of
this
sort
of
thing
on
my
premises
!
"
<EOS>
he
interposes
with
an
air
of
authority
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Mackin
,
keep
yourself
to
yourself
,
or
you
do
n't
get
fourpence
for
a
flat

Jinkins

you
leave
your
ticket
here
till

two

so
make

scarce

before
I

scarcer

"
   
<EOS>
This
eloquent
address
produces
anything
but
the
effect
desired
;
the
women
rail
in
concert
;
the
man
hits
about
him
in
all
directions
,
and
is
in
the
act
of
establishing
an
indisputable
claim
to
gratuitous
lodgings
for
the
night
,
when
the
entrance
of
his
wife
,
a
wretched
,
worn
-
out
woman
,
apparently
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
,
whose
face
bears
evident
marks
of
recent
ill
-
usage
,
and
whose
strength
seems
hardly
equal
to
the
burden
---
light
enough
,
God
knows
!
<EOS>
---
of
the
thin
,
sickly
child
she
carries
in
her
arms
,
turns
his
cowardly
rage
in
a
safer
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
home
,
dear
,
"
cries
the
miserable
creature
,
in
an
imploring
tone
;
<EOS>
"
DO
come
home
,
there
's
a
good
fellow
,
and
go
to
bed
.
"
---
<EOS>
"
Go
home
yourself
,
"
rejoins
the
furious
ruffian
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
come
home
quietly
,
"
repeats
the
wife
,
bursting
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
home
yourself
,
"
retorts
the
husband
again
,
enforcing
his
argument
by
a
blow
which
sends
the
poor
creature
flying
out
of
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
Her
"
natural
protector
"
follows
her
up
the
court
,
alternately
venting
his
rage
in
accelerating
her
progress
,
and
in
knocking
the
little
scanty
blue
bonnet
of
the
unfortunate
child
over
its
still
more
scanty
and
faded
-
looking
face
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
last
box
,
which
is
situated
in
the
darkest
and
most
obscure
corner
of
the
shop
,
considerably
removed
from
either
of
the
gas
-
lights
,
are
a
young
delicate
girl
of
about
twenty
,
and
an
elderly
female
,
evidently
her
mother
from
the
resemblance
between
them
,
who
stand
at
some
distance
back
,
as
if
to
avoid
the
observation
even
of
the
shopman
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
their
first
visit
to
a
pawnbroker
's
shop
,
for
they
answer
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
the
usual
questions
,
put
in
a
rather
respectful
manner
,
and
in
a
much
lower
tone
than
usual
,
of
<EOS>
"
What
name
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Your
own
property
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
---
Where
do
you
live
?
<EOS>
---
Housekeeper
or
lodger
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
bargain
,
too
,
for
a
higher
loan
than
the
shopman
is
at
first
inclined
to
offer
,
which
a
perfect
stranger
would
be
little
disposed
to
do
;
and
the
elder
female
urges
her
daughter
on
,
in
scarcely
audible
whispers
,
to
exert
her
utmost
powers
of
persuasion
to
obtain
an
advance
of
the
sum
,
and
expatiate
on
the
value
of
the
articles
they
have
brought
to
raise
a
present
supply
upon
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
a
small
gold
chain
and
a
"
Forget
me
not
"
ring
:
 
<EOS>
the
girl
's
property
,
for
they
are
both
too
small
for
the
mother
;
given
her
in
better
times
;
prized
,
perhaps
,
once
,
for
the
giver
's
sake
,
but
parted
with
now
without
a
struggle
;
for
want
has
hardened
the
mother
,
and
her
example
has
hardened
the
girl
,
and
the
prospect
of
receiving
money
,
coupled
with
a
recollection
of
the
misery
they
have
both
endured
from
the
want
of
it
---
the
coldness
of
old
friends
---
the
stern
refusal
of
some
,
and
the
still
more
galling
compassion
of
others
---
appears
to
have
obliterated
the
consciousness
of
self
-
humiliation
,
which
the
idea
of
their
present
situation
would
once
have
aroused
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
next
box
,
is
a
young
female
,
whose
attire
,
miserably
poor
,
but
extremely
gaudy
,
wretchedly
cold
,
but
extravagantly
fine
,
too
plainly
bespeaks
her
station
.
 
<EOS>
The
rich
satin
gown
with
its
faded
trimmings
,
the
worn
-
out
thin
shoes
,
and
pink
silk
stockings
,
the
summer
bonnet
in
winter
,
and
the
sunken
face
,
where
a
daub
of
rouge
only
serves
as
an
index
to
the
ravages
of
squandered
health
never
to
be
regained
,
and
lost
happiness
never
to
be
restored
,
and
where
the
practised
smile
is
a
wretched
mockery
of
the
misery
of
the
heart
,
can
not
be
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
in
the
glimpse
she
has
just
caught
of
her
young
neighbour
,
and
in
the
sight
of
the
little
trinkets
she
has
offered
in
pawn
,
that
seems
to
have
awakened
in
this
woman
's
mind
some
slumbering
recollection
,
and
to
have
changed
,
for
an
instant
,
her
whole
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
Her
first
hasty
impulse
was
to
bend
forward
as
if
to
scan
more
minutely
the
appearance
of
her
half
-
concealed
companions
;
her
next
,
on
seeing
them
involuntarily
shrink
from
her
,
to
retreat
to
the
back
of
the
box
,
cover
her
face
with
her
hands
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
strange
chords
in
the
human
heart
,
which
will
lie
dormant
through
years
of
depravity
and
wickedness
,
but
which
will
vibrate
at
last
to
some
slight
circumstance
apparently
trivial
in
itself
,
but
connected
by
some
undefined
and
indistinct
association
,
with
past
days
that
can
never
be
recalled
,
and
with
bitter
recollections
from
which
the
most
degraded
creature
in
existence
can
not
escape
.
   
<EOS>
There
has
been
another
spectator
,
in
the
person
of
a
woman
in
the
common
shop
;
the
lowest
of
the
low
;
dirty
,
unbonneted
,
flaunting
,
and
slovenly
.
 
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
was
at
first
attracted
by
the
little
she
could
see
of
the
group
;
then
her
attention
.
 
<EOS>
The
half
-
intoxicated
leer
changed
to
an
expression
of
something
like
interest
,
and
a
feeling
similar
to
that
we
have
described
,
appeared
for
a
moment
,
and
only
a
moment
,
to
extend
itself
even
to
her
bosom
.
   
<EOS>
Who
shall
say
how
soon
these
women
may
change
places
?
 
<EOS>
The
last
has
but
two
more
stages
---
the
hospital
and
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
females
situated
as
her
two
companions
are
,
and
as
she
may
have
been
once
,
have
terminated
the
same
wretched
course
,
in
the
same
wretched
manner
!
 
<EOS>
One
is
already
tracing
her
footsteps
with
frightful
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
How
soon
may
the
other
follow
her
example
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
have
done
the
same
!
   
<EOS>
Criminal
courts
<EOS>
We
shall
never
forget
the
mingled
feelings
of
awe
and
respect
with
which
we
used
to
gaze
on
the
exterior
of
Newgate
in
our
schoolboy
days
.
 
<EOS>
How
dreadful
its
rough
heavy
walls
,
and
low
massive
doors
,
appeared
to
us
---
the
latter
looking
as
if
they
were
made
for
the
express
purpose
of
letting
people
in
,
and
never
letting
them
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
fetters
over
the
debtors
'
door
,
which
we
used
to
think
were
a
BONA
FIDE
set
of
irons
,
just
hung
up
there
,
for
convenience
"
sake
,
ready
to
be
taken
down
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
and
riveted
on
the
limbs
of
some
refractory
felon
!
 
<EOS>
We
were
never
tired
of
wondering
how
the
hackney
-
coachmen
on
the
opposite
stand
could
cut
jokes
in
the
presence
of
such
horrors
,
and
drink
pots
of
half
-
and
-
half
so
near
the
last
drop
.
   
<EOS>
Often
have
we
strayed
here
,
in
sessions
time
,
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
whipping
-
place
,
and
that
dark
building
on
one
side
of
the
yard
,
in
which
is
kept
the
gibbet
with
all
its
dreadful
apparatus
,
and
on
the
door
of
which
we
half
expected
to
see
a
brass
plate
,
with
the
inscription
"
Mr
Ketch
;
"
for
we
never
imagined
that
the
distinguished
functionary
could
by
possibility
live
anywhere
else
!
<EOS>
The
days
of
these
childish
dreams
have
passed
away
,
and
with
them
many
other
boyish
ideas
of
a
gayer
nature
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
still
retain
so
much
of
our
original
feeling
<EOS>
,
that
to
this
hour
we
never
pass
the
building
without
something
like
a
shudder
.
   
<EOS>
What
London
pedestrian
is
there
who
has
not
,
at
some
time
or
other
,
cast
a
hurried
glance
through
the
wicket
at
which
prisoners
are
admitted
into
this
gloomy
mansion
,
and
surveyed
the
few
objects
he
could
discern
,
with
an
indescribable
feeling
of
curiosity
?
 
<EOS>
The
thick
door
,
plated
with
iron
and
mounted
with
spikes
,
just
low
enough
to
enable
you
to
see
,
leaning
over
them
,
an
ill
-
looking
fellow
,
in
a
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
Belcher
handkerchief
and
top
-
boots
:
with
a
brown
coat
,
something
between
a
great
-
coat
and
a
"
sporting
"
jacket
,
on
his
back
,
and
an
immense
key
in
his
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
are
lucky
enough
to
pass
,
just
as
the
gate
is
being
opened
;
then
,
you
see
on
the
other
side
of
the
lodge
,
another
gate
,
the
image
of
its
predecessor
,
and
two
or
three
more
turnkeys
,
who
look
like
multiplications
of
the
first
one
,
seated
round
a
fire
which
just
lights
up
the
whitewashed
apartment
sufficiently
to
enable
you
to
catch
a
hasty
glimpse
of
these
different
objects
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
great
respect
for
Mrs
Fry
,
but
she
certainly
ought
to
have
written
more
romances
than
Mrs
Radcliffe
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
walking
leisurely
down
the
Old
Bailey
,
some
time
ago
,
when
,
as
we
passed
this
identical
gate
,
it
was
opened
by
the
officiating
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
We
turned
quickly
round
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
saw
two
persons
descending
the
steps
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
help
stopping
and
observing
them
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
an
elderly
woman
,
of
decent
appearance
,
though
evidently
poor
,
and
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
was
crying
bitterly
;
she
carried
a
small
bundle
in
her
hand
,
and
the
boy
followed
at
a
short
distance
behind
her
.
 
<EOS>
Their
little
history
was
obvious
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
was
her
son
,
to
whose
early
comfort
she
had
perhaps
sacrificed
her
own
---
for
whose
sake
she
had
borne
misery
without
repining
,
and
poverty
without
a
murmur
---
looking
steadily
forward
to
the
time
,
when
he
who
had
so
long
witnessed
her
struggles
for
himself
,
might
be
enabled
to
make
some
exertions
for
their
joint
support
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
formed
dissolute
connexions
;
idleness
had
led
to
crime
;
and
he
had
been
committed
to
take
his
trial
for
some
petty
theft
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
long
in
prison
,
and
,
after
receiving
some
trifling
additional
punishment
,
had
been
ordered
to
be
discharged
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
first
offence
,
and
<EOS>
his
poor
old
mother
,
still
hoping
to
reclaim
him
,
had
been
waiting
at
the
gate
to
implore
him
to
return
home
.
   
<EOS>
We
can
not
forget
the
boy
;
he
descended
the
steps
with
a
dogged
look
,
shaking
his
head
with
an
air
of
bravado
and
obstinate
determination
.
 
<EOS>
They
walked
a
few
paces
,
and
paused
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
in
an
agony
of
entreaty
,
and
the
boy
sullenly
raised
his
head
as
if
in
refusal
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
brilliant
morning
,
and
every
object
looked
fresh
and
happy
in
the
broad
,
gay
sunlight
;
he
gazed
round
him
for
a
few
moments
,
bewildered
with
the
brightness
of
the
scene
,
for
it
was
long
since
he
had
beheld
anything
save
the
gloomy
walls
of
a
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
wretchedness
of
his
mother
made
some
impression
on
the
boy
's
heart
;
perhaps
some
undefined
recollection
of
the
time
when
he
was
a
happy
child
,
and
she
his
only
friend
,
and
best
companion
,
crowded
on
him
---
he
burst
into
tears
;
and
covering
his
face
with
one
hand
,
and
hurriedly
placing
the
other
in
his
mother
's
,
walked
away
with
her
.
   
<EOS>
Curiosity
has
occasionally
led
us
into
both
Courts
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
is
so
likely
to
strike
the
person
who
enters
them
for
the
first
time
,
as
the
calm
indifference
with
which
the
proceedings
are
conducted
;
every
trial
seems
a
mere
matter
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
great
deal
of
form
,
but
no
compassion
;
considerable
interest
,
but
no
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
Take
the
Old
Court
for
example
.
 
<EOS>
There
sit
the
judges
,
with
whose
great
dignity
everybody
is
acquainted
,
and
of
whom
therefore
we
need
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
is
the
Lord
Mayor
in
the
centre
,
looking
as
cool
as
a
Lord
Mayor
CAN
look
,
with
an
immense
BOUQUET
before
him
,
and
habited
in
all
the
splendour
of
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
are
the
Sheriffs
,
who
are
almost
as
dignified
as
the
Lord
Mayor
himself
;
and
<EOS>
the
Barristers
,
who
are
quite
dignified
enough
in
their
own
opinion
;
and
the
spectators
,
who
having
paid
for
their
admission
,
look
upon
the
whole
scene
as
if
it
were
got
up
especially
for
their
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
Look
upon
the
whole
group
in
the
body
of
the
Court
---
some
wholly
engrossed
in
the
morning
papers
,
others
carelessly
conversing
in
low
whispers
,
and
others
,
again
,
quietly
dozing
away
an
hour
---
and
you
can
scarcely
believe
that
the
result
of
the
trial
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death
to
one
wretched
being
present
.
 
<EOS>
But
turn
your
eyes
to
the
dock
;
watch
the
prisoner
attentively
for
a
few
moments
;
and
the
fact
is
before
you
,
in
all
its
painful
reality
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
how
restlessly
he
has
been
engaged
for
the
last
ten
minutes
,
in
forming
all
sorts
of
fantastic
figures
with
the
herbs
which
are
strewed
upon
the
ledge
before
him
;
observe
the
ashy
paleness
of
his
face
when
a
particular
witness
appears
,
and
how
he
changes
his
position
and
wipes
his
clammy
forehead
,
and
feverish
hands
,
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
is
closed
,
as
if
it
were
a
relief
to
him
to
feel
that
the
jury
knew
the
worst
.
   
<EOS>
The
defence
is
concluded
;
the
judge
proceeds
to
sum
up
the
evidence
;
and
the
prisoner
watches
the
countenances
of
the
jury
,
as
a
dying
man
,
clinging
to
life
to
the
very
last
<EOS>
,
vainly
looks
in
the
face
of
his
physician
for
a
slight
ray
of
hope
.
 
<EOS>
They
turn
round
to
consult
;
you
can
almost
hear
the
man
's
heart
beat
,
as
he
bites
the
stalk
of
rosemary
,
with
a
desperate
effort
to
appear
composed
.
<EOS>
They
resume
their
places
---
a
dead
silence
prevails
as
the
foreman
delivers
in
the
verdict
---
"
Guilty
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
shriek
bursts
from
a
female
in
the
gallery
;
the
prisoner
casts
one
look
at
the
quarter
from
whence
the
noise
proceeded
;
and
is
immediately
hurried
from
the
dock
by
the
gaoler
.
 
<EOS>
The
clerk
directs
one
of
the
officers
of
the
Court
to
"
take
the
woman
out
,
"
and
fresh
business
is
proceeded
with
,
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
.
   
<EOS>
No
imaginary
contrast
to
a
case
like
this
,
could
be
as
complete
as
that
which
is
constantly
presented
in
the
New
Court
,
the
gravity
of
which
is
frequently
disturbed
in
no
small
degree
,
by
the
cunning
and
pertinacity
of
juvenile
offenders
.
 
<EOS>
A
boy
of
thirteen
is
tried
,
say
for
picking
the
pocket
of
some
subject
of
her
Majesty
,
and
the
offence
is
about
as
clearly
proved
as
an
offence
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
called
upon
for
his
defence
,
and
contents
himself
with
a
little
declamation
about
the
jurymen
and
his
country
---
asserts
that
all
the
witnesses
have
committed
perjury
,
and
hints
that
the
police
force
generally
have
entered
into
a
conspiracy
"
again
'
"
him
.
<EOS>
However
probable
this
statement
may
be
,
it
fails
to
convince
the
Court
,
and
some
such
scene
as
the
following
then
takes
place
:
   
COURT
:
 
<EOS>
Have
you
any
witnesses
to
speak
to
your
character
,
boy
?
   
<EOS>
BOY
:
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
Lord
;
fifteen
gen'lm'n
is
a
vaten
outside
,
and
vos
a
vaten
all
day
yesterday
,
vich
they
told
me
the
night
afore
<EOS>
my
trial
vos
a
comin
'
on
.
   
<EOS>
COURT
.
 
<EOS>
Inquire
for
these
witnesses
.
   
<EOS>
Here
,
a
stout
beadle
runs
out
,
and
vociferates
for
the
witnesses
at
the
very
top
of
his
voice
;
for
you
hear
his
cry
grow
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
descends
the
steps
into
the
court
-
yard
below
.
 
<EOS>
After
an
absence
of
five
minutes
,
he
returns
,
very
warm
and
hoarse
,
and
informs
the
Court
of
what
it
knew
perfectly
well
before
---
namely
,
that
there
are
no
such
witnesses
in
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
the
boy
sets
up
a
most
awful
howling
;
screws
the
lower
part
of
the
palms
of
his
hands
into
the
corners
of
his
eyes
;
and
endeavours
to
look
the
picture
of
injured
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
The
jury
at
once
find
him
"
guilty
,
"
and
his
endeavours
to
squeeze
out
a
tear
or
two
are
redoubled
.
 
<EOS>
The
governor
of
the
gaol
then
states
,
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
from
the
bench
,
that
the
prisoner
has
been
under
his
care
twice
before
.
<EOS>
This
the
urchin
resolutely
denies
in
some
such
terms
as
---
"
S'elp
me
,
gen'lm'n
,
I
never
vos
in
trouble
afore
---
indeed
,
my
Lord
,
I
never
vos
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
a
howen
to
my
having
a
twin
brother
,
vich
has
wrongfully
got
into
trouble
,
and
vich
is
so
exactly
like
me
,
that
no
vun
ever
knows
the
difference
atween
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
representation
,
like
the
defence
,
fails
in
producing
the
desired
effect
,
and
the
boy
is
sentenced
,
perhaps
,
to
seven
years
'
transportation
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
it
impossible
to
excite
compassion
,
he
gives
vent
to
his
feelings
in
an
imprecation
bearing
reference
to
the
eyes
of
"
old
big
vig
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
declines
to
take
the
trouble
of
walking
from
the
dock
,
is
forthwith
carried
out
,
congratulating
himself
on
having
succeeded
in
giving
everybody
as
much
trouble
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
A
visit
to
Newgate
"
<EOS>
The
force
of
habit
"
is
a
trite
phrase
in
everybody
's
mouth
;
and
it
is
not
a
little
remarkable
that
those
who
use
it
most
as
applied
to
others
,
unconsciously
afford
in
their
own
persons
singular
examples
of
the
power
which
habit
and
custom
exercise
over
the
minds
of
men
,
and
of
the
little
reflection
they
are
apt
to
bestow
on
subjects
with
which
every
day
's
experience
has
rendered
them
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
If
Bedlam
could
be
suddenly
removed
like
another
Aladdin
's
palace
,
and
set
down
on
the
space
now
occupied
by
Newgate
,
scarcely
one
man
out
of
a
hundred
,
whose
road
to
business
every
morning
lies
through
Newgate
-
street
,
or
the
Old

would
pass
the
building
without
bestowing
a
hasty
glance
on
its
small
,
grated
windows
,
and
a
transient
thought
upon
the
condition
of
the
unhappy
beings
immured
in
its
dismal
cells
;
and
yet
these
same
men
,
day
by
day
,
and
hour
by
hour
,
pass
and
repass
this
gloomy
depository
of
the
guilt
and
misery
of
London
,
in
one
perpetual
stream
of
life
and
bustle
,
utterly
unmindful
of
the
throng
of
wretched
creatures
pent
up
within
it
---
nay
,
not
even
knowing
,
or
if
they
do
,
not
heeding
,
the
fact
,
that
as
they
pass
one
particular
angle
of
the
massive
wall
with
a
light
laugh
or
a
merry
whistle
,
they
stand
within
one
yard
of
a
fellow
-
creature
,
bound
and
helpless
,
whose
hours
are
numbered
,
from
whom
the
last
feeble
ray
of
hope
has
fled
for
ever
,
and
whose
miserable
career
will
shortly
terminate
in
a
violent
and
shameful
death
.
 
<EOS>
Contact
with
death
even
in
its
least
terrible
shape
,
is
solemn
and
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
more
awful
is
it
to
reflect
on
this
near
vicinity
to
the
dying
---
to
men
in
full
health
and
vigour
,
in
the
flower
of
youth
or
the
prime
of
life
,
with
all
their
faculties
and
perceptions
as
acute
and
perfect
as
your
own
;
but
dying
,
nevertheless
---
dying
as
surely
---
with
the
hand
of
death
imprinted
upon
them
as
indelibly
---
as
if
mortal
disease
had
wasted
their
frames
to
shadows
,
and
corruption
had
already
begun
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
with
some
such
thoughts
as
these
that
we
determined
,
not
many
weeks
since
,
to
visit
the
interior
of
Newgate
---
in
an
amateur
capacity
,
of
course
;
and
,
having
carried
our
intention
into
effect
,
we
proceed
to
lay
its
results
before
our
readers
,
in
the
hope
---
founded
more
upon
the
nature
of
the
subject
,
than
on
any
presumptuous
confidence
in
our
own
descriptive
powers
---
that
this
paper
may
not
be
found
wholly
devoid
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
only
to
premise
,
that
we
do
not
intend
to
fatigue
the
reader
with
any
statistical
accounts
of
the
prison
;
they
will
be
found
at
length
in
numerous
reports
of
numerous
committees
,
and
a
variety
of
authorities
of
equal
weight
.
 
<EOS>
We
took
no
notes
,
made
no
memoranda
,
measured
none
of
the
yards
,
ascertained
the
exact
number
of
inches
in
no
particular
room
:
 
are
unable
even
to
report
of
how
many
apartments
the
gaol
is
composed
.
   
<EOS>
We
saw
the
prison
,
and
saw
the
prisoners
;
and
what
we
did
see
,
and
what
we
thought
,
we
will
tell
at
once
in
our
own
way
.
   
<EOS>
Having
delivered
our
credentials
to
the
servant
who
answered
our
knock
at
the
door
of
the
governor
's
house
,
we
were
ushered
into
the
"
office
;
"
a
little
room
,
on
the
right
-
hand
side
as
you
enter
,
with
two
windows
looking
into
the
Old
Bailey
:
 
fitted
up
like
an
ordinary
attorney
's
office
,
or
merchant
's
counting
-
house
,
with
the
usual
fixtures
---
a
wainscoted
partition
,
a
shelf
or
two
,
a
desk
,
a
couple
of
stools
,
a
pair
of
clerks
,
an
almanack
,
a
clock
,
and
a
few
maps
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
delay
,
occasioned
by
sending
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
for
the
officer
whose
duty
it
was
to
conduct
us
,
that
functionary
arrived
;
a
respectable
-
looking
man
of
about
two
or
three
and
fifty
,
in
a
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
and
full
suit
of
black
,
who
,
but
for
his
keys
,
would
have
looked
quite
as
much
like
a
clergyman
as
a
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
disappointed
;
he
had
not
even
top
-
boots
on
.
 
<EOS>
Following
our
conductor
by
a
door
opposite
to
that
<EOS>
at
which
we
had
entered
,
we
arrived
at
a
small
room
,
without
any
other
furniture
than
a
little
desk
,
with
a
book
for
visitors
'
autographs
,
and
a
shelf
,
on
which
were
a
few
boxes
for
papers
,
and
casts
of
the
heads
and
faces
of
the
two
notorious
murderers
,
Bishop
and
Williams
;
the
former
,
in
particular
,
exhibiting
a
style
of
head
and
set
of
features
,
which
might
have
afforded
sufficient
moral
grounds
for
his
instant
execution
at
any
time
,
even
had
there
been
no
other
evidence
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
this
room
also
,
by
an
opposite
door
,
we
found
ourself
in
the
lodge
which
opens
on
the
Old
Bailey
;
one
side
of
which
is
plentifully
garnished
with
a
choice
collection
of
heavy
sets
of
irons
,
including
those
worn
by
the
redoubtable
Jack
Sheppard
---
genuine
;
and
those
SAID
to
have
been
graced
by
the
sturdy
limbs
of
the
no
less
celebrated
Dick
Turpin
---
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
lodge
,
a
heavy
oaken
gate
,
bound
with
iron
,
studded
with
nails
of
the
same
material
,
and
guarded
by
another
turnkey
,
opens
on
a
few
steps
,
if
we
remember
right
,
which
terminate
in
a
narrow
and
dismal
stone
passage
,
running
parallel
with
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
leading
to
the
different
yards
,
through
a
number
of
tortuous
and
intricate
windings
,
guarded
in
their
turn
by
huge
gates
and
gratings
,
whose
appearance
is
sufficient
to
dispel
at
once
the
slightest
hope
of
escape
that
any
new
-
comer
may
have
entertained
;
and
the
very
recollection
of
which
,
on
eventually
traversing
the
place
again
,
involves
one
in
a
maze
of
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
necessary
to
explain
here
,
that
the
buildings
in
the
prison
,
or
in
other
words
the
different
wards
---
form
a
square
,
of
which
the
four
sides
abut
respectively
on
the
Old
Bailey
,
the
old
College
of
Physicians
(
now
forming
a
part
of
Newgate
-
market
)
,
the
Sessions
-
house
,
and
Newgate
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
intermediate
space
is
divided
into
several
paved
yards
,
in
which
the
prisoners
take
such
air
and
exercise
as
can
be
had
in
such
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
These
yards
,
with
the
exception
of
that
in
which
prisoners
under
sentence
of
death
are
confined
(
of
which
we
shall
presently
give
a
more
detailed
description
)
,
run
parallel
with
Newgate
-
street
,
and
consequently
from
the
Old
Bailey
,
as
it
were
,
to
Newgate
-
market
.
 
<EOS>
The
women
's
side
is
in
the
right
wing
of
the
prison
nearest
the
Sessions
-
house
.
<EOS>
As
we
were
introduced
into
this
part
of
the
building
first
,
we
will
adopt
the
same
order
,
and
introduce
our
readers
to
it
also
.
   
<EOS>
Turning
to
the
right
,
then
,
down
the
passage
to
which
we
just
now
adverted
,
omitting
any
mention
of
intervening
gates
<EOS>
---
for
if
we
noticed
every
gate
that
was
unlocked
for
us
to
pass
through
,
and
locked
again
as
soon
as
we
had
passed
,
we
should
require
a
gate
at
every
comma
<EOS>
---
we
came
to
a
door
composed
of
thick
bars
of
wood
,
through
which
were
discernible
,
passing
to
and
fro
in
a
narrow
yard
,
some
twenty
women
:
 
the
majority
of
whom
,
however
,
as
soon
as
they
were
aware
of
the
presence
of
strangers
,
retreated
to
their
wards
.
 
<EOS>
One
side
of
this
yard
is
railed
off
at
a
considerable
distance
,
and
formed
into
a
kind
of
iron
cage
,
about
five
feet
ten
inches
in
height
,
roofed
at
the
top
,
and
defended
in
front
by
iron
bars
,
from
which
the
friends
of
the
female
prisoners
communicate
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
corner
of
this
singular
-
looking
den
,
was
a
yellow
,
haggard
,
decrepit
old
woman
,
in
a
tattered
gown
that
had
once
been
black
,
and
the
remains
of
an
old
straw
bonnet
,
with
faded
ribbon
of
the
same
hue
,
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
young
girl
---
a
prisoner
,
of
course
---
of
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
more
poverty
-
stricken
object
,
or
a
creature
so
borne
down
in
soul
and
body
,
by
excess
of
misery
and
destitution
,
as
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
was
a
good
-
looking
,
robust
female
,
with
a
profusion
of
hair
streaming
about
in
the
wind
---
for
she
had
no
bonnet
on
---
and
a
man
's
silk
pocket
-
handkerchief
loosely
thrown
over
a
most
ample
pair
of
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
woman
was
talking
in
that
low
,
stifled
tone
of
voice
which
tells
so
forcibly
of
mental
anguish
;
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
burst
into
an
irrepressible
sharp
,
abrupt
cry
of
grief
,
the
most
distressing
sound
that
ears
can
hear
.
<EOS>
The
girl
was
perfectly
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
Hardened
beyond
all
hope
of
redemption
,
she
listened
doggedly
to
her
mother
's
entreaties
,
whatever
they
were
:
 
and
,
beyond
inquiring
after
"
Jem
,
"
and
eagerly
catching
at
the
few
halfpence
her
miserable
parent
had
brought
her
,
took
no
more
apparent
interest
in
the
conversation
than
the
most
unconcerned
spectators
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
there
were
enough
of
them
,
in
the
persons
of
the
other
prisoners
in
the
yard
,
who
were
no
more
concerned
by
what
was
passing
before
their
eyes
,
and
within
their
hearing
,
than
if
they
were
blind
and
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
they
be
?
<EOS>
Inside
the
prison
,
and
out
,
such
scenes
were
too
familiar
to
them
,
to
excite
even
a
passing
thought
,
unless
of
ridicule
or
contempt
for
feelings
which
they
had
long
since
forgotten
.
   
<EOS>
A
little
farther
on
,
a
squalid
-
looking
woman
in
a
slovenly
,
thick
-
bordered
cap
,
with
her
arms
muffled
in
a
large
red
shawl
,
the
fringed
ends
of
which
straggled
nearly
to
the
bottom
of
a
dirty
white
apron
,
was
communicating
some
instructions
to
HER
visitor
---
her
daughter
evidently
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
was
thinly
clad
,
and
shaking
with
the
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Some
ordinary
word
of
recognition
passed
between
her
and
her
mother
when
she
appeared
at
the
grating
,
but
neither
hope
,
condolence
,
regret
,
nor
affection
was
expressed
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
The
mother
whispered
her
instructions
,
and
the
girl
received
them
with
her
pinched
-
up
,
half
-
starved
features
twisted
into
an
expression
of
careful
cunning
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
some
scheme
for
the
woman
's
defence
that
she
was
disclosing
,
perhaps
;
and
a
sullen
smile
came
over
the
girl
's
face
for
an
instant
,
as
if
she
were
pleased
:
 
not
so
much
at
the
probability
of
her
mother
's
liberation
,
as
at
the
chance
of
her
"
getting
off
"
in
spite
of
her
prosecutors
.
 
<EOS>
The
dialogue
was
soon
concluded
;
and
with
the
same
careless
indifference
with
which
they
had
approached
each
other
,
the
mother
turned
towards
the
inner
end
of
the
yard
,
and
the
girl
to
the
gate
at
which
she
had
entered
.
   
<EOS>
The
girl
belonged
to
a
class
---
unhappily
but
too
extensive
---
the
very
existence
of
which
,
should
make
men
's
hearts
bleed
.
 
<EOS>
Barely
past
her
childhood
,
it
required
but
a
glance
to
discover
that
she
was
one
of
those
children
,
born
and
bred
in
neglect
and
vice
,
who
have
never
known
what
childhood
is
:
 
who
have
never
been
taught
to
love
and
court
a
parent
's
smile
,
or
to
dread
a
parent
's
frown
.
 
<EOS>
The
thousand
nameless
endearments
of
childhood
,
its
gaiety
and
its
innocence
,
are
alike
unknown
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
entered
at
once
upon
the
stern
realities
and
miseries
of
life
,
and
to
their
better
nature
it
is
almost
hopeless
to
appeal
in
after
-
times
,
by
any
of
the
references
which
will
awaken
,
if
it
be
only
for
a
moment
,
some
good
feeling
in
ordinary
bosoms
,
however
corrupt
they
may
have
become
.
 
<EOS>
Talk
to
THEM
of
parental
solicitude
,
the
happy
days
of
childhood
,
and
the
merry
games
of
infancy
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
them
of
hunger
and
the
streets
,
beggary
and
stripes
,
the
gin
-
shop
,
the
station
-
house
,
and
the
pawnbroker
's
,
and
they
will
understand
you
.
   
<EOS>
Two
or
three
women
were
standing
at
different
parts
of
the
grating
,
conversing
with
their
friends
,
but
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
prisoners
appeared
to
have
no
friends
at
all
,
beyond
such
of
their
old
companions
as
might
happen
to
be
within
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
passing
hastily
down
the
yard
,
and
pausing
only
for
an
instant
to
notice
the
little
incidents
we
have
just
recorded
,
we
were
conducted
up
a
clean
and
well
-
lighted
flight
of
stone
stairs
to
one
of
the
wards
.
<EOS>
There
are
several
in
this
part
of
the
building
,
but
a
description
of
one
is
a
description
of
the
whole
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
spacious
,
bare
,
whitewashed
apartment
,
lighted
,
of
course
,
by
windows
looking
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
,
but
far
more
light
and
airy
than
one
could
reasonably
expect
to
find
in
such
a
situation
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
fire
with
a
deal
table
before
it
,
round
which
<EOS>
ten
or
a
dozen
women
were
seated
on
wooden
forms
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Along
both
sides
of
the
room
ran
a
shelf
;
below
it
,
at
regular
intervals
,
a
row
of
large
hooks
were
fixed
in
the
wall
,
on
each
of
which
was
hung
the
sleeping
mat
of
a
prisoner
:
 
her
rug
and
blanket
being
folded
up
,
and
placed
on
the
shelf
above
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
,
these
mats
are
placed
on
the
floor
,
each
beneath
the
hook
on
which
it
hangs
during
the
day
;
and
the
ward
is
thus
made
to
answer
the
purposes
both
of
a
day
-
room
and
sleeping
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
fireplace
,
was
a
large
sheet
of
pasteboard
,
on
which
were
displayed
a
variety
of
texts
from
Scripture
,
which
were
also
scattered
about
the
room
in
scraps
about
the
size
and
shape
of
the
copy
-
slips
which
are
used
in
schools
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
table
was
a
sufficient
provision
of
a
kind
of
stewed
beef
and
brown
bread
,
in
pewter
dishes
,
which
are
kept
perfectly
bright
,
and
displayed
on
shelves
in
great
order
and
regularity
when
they
are
not
in
use
.
   
<EOS>
The
women
rose
hastily
,
on
our
entrance
,
and
retired
in
a
hurried
manner
to
either
side
of
the
fireplace
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
cleanly
---
<EOS>
many
of
them
decently
---
attired
,
and
there
was
nothing
peculiar
,
either
in
their
appearance
or
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
two
resumed
the
needlework
which
they
had
probably
laid
aside
at
the
commencement
of
their
meal
;
others
gazed
at
the
visitors
with
listless
curiosity
;
and
a
few
retired
behind
their
companions
to
the
very
end
of
the
room
,
as
if
desirous
to
avoid
even
the
casual
observation
of
the
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
Some
old
Irish
women
,
both
in
this
and
other
wards
,
to
whom
the
thing
was
no
novelty
,
appeared
perfectly
indifferent
to
our
presence
,
and
remained
standing
close
to
the
seats
from
which
they
had
just
risen
;
but
the
general
feeling
among
the
females
seemed
to
be
one
of
uneasiness
during
the
period
of
our
stay
among
them
:
 
which
was
very
brief
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
uttered
during
the
time
of
our
remaining
,
unless
,
indeed
,
by
the
wardswoman
in
reply
to
some
question
which
we
put
to
the
turnkey
who
accompanied
us
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
ward
on
the
female
side
,
a
wardswoman
is
appointed
to
preserve
order
,
and
a
similar
regulation
is
adopted
among
the
males
.
 
<EOS>
The
wardsmen
and
wardswomen
are
all
prisoners
,
selected
for
good
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
They
alone
are
allowed
the
privilege
of
sleeping
on
bedsteads
;
a
small
stump
bedstead
being
placed
in
every
ward
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
On
both
sides
of
the
gaol
,
is
a
small
receiving
-
room
,
to
which
prisoners
are
conducted
on
their
first
reception
,
and
whence
they
can
not
be
removed
until
they
have
been
examined
by
the
surgeon
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
(

Retracing
our
steps
to
the
dismal
passage
in
which
we
found
ourselves
at
first
(
and
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
contains
three
or
four
dark
cells
for
the
accommodation
of
refractory
prisoners
)
,
we
were
led
through
a
narrow
yard
to
the
"
school
"
---
a
portion
of
the
prison
set
apart
for
boys
under
fourteen
years
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
tolerable
-
sized
room
,
in
which
were
writing
-
materials
and
some
copy
-
books
,
was
the
schoolmaster
,
with
a
couple
of
his
pupils
;
the
remainder
having
been
fetched
from
an
adjoining
apartment
,
the
whole
were
drawn
up
in
line
for
our
inspection
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
fourteen
of
them
in
all
,
some
with
shoes
,
some
without
;
some
in
pinafores
without
jackets
,
others
in
jackets
without
pinafores
,
and
one
in
scarce
anything
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
number
,
without
an
exception
we
believe
,
had
been
committed
for
trial
on
charges
of
pocket
-
picking
;
and
fourteen
such
terrible
little
faces
we
never
beheld
.
<EOS>
---
There
was
not
one
redeeming
feature
among
them
---
not
a
glance
of
honesty
---
not
a
wink
expressive
of
anything
<EOS>
but
the
gallows
and
the
hulks
,
in
the
whole
collection
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
anything
like
shame
or
contrition
,
that
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
evidently
quite
gratified
at
being
thought
worth
the
trouble
of
looking
at
;
their
idea
appeared
to
be
,
that
we
had
come
to
see
Newgate
as
a
grand
affair
,
and
that
they
were
an
indispensable
part
of
the
show
;
and
every
boy
as
he
"
fell
in
"
to
the
line
,
actually
seemed
as
pleased
and
important
as
if
he
had
done
something
excessively
meritorious
in
getting
there
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
looked
upon
a
more
disagreeable
sight
,
because
we
never
saw
fourteen
such
hopeless
creatures
of
neglect
,
before
.
   
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
the
school
-
yard
is
a
yard
for
men
,
in
one
of
which
---
that
towards
Newgate
-
street
---
prisoners
of
the
more
respectable
class
are
confined
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
other
,
we
have
little
description
to
offer
,
as
the
different
wards
necessarily
partake
of
the
same
character
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
provided
,
like
the
wards
on
the
women
's
side
,
with
mats
and
rugs
,
which
are
disposed
of
in
the
same
manner
during
the
day
;
the
only
very
striking
difference
between
their
appearance
and
that
of
the
wards
inhabited
by
the
females
,
is
the
utter
absence
of
any
employment
.
 
<EOS>
Huddled
together
on
two
opposite
forms
,
by
the
fireside
,
sit
twenty
men
perhaps
;
here
,
a
boy
in
livery
;
there
,
a
man
in
a
rough
great
-
coat
and
top
-
boots
;
farther
on
,
a
desperate
-
looking
fellow
in
his
shirt
-
sleeves
,
with
an
old
Scotch
cap
upon
his
shaggy
head
;
near
him
again
,
a
tall
ruffian
,
in
a
smock
-
frock
;
<EOS>
next
to
him
,
a
miserable
being
of
distressed
appearance
,
with
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
;
---
all
alike
in
one
respect
,
all
idle
and
listless
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
do
leave
the
fire
,
sauntering
moodily
about
,
lounging
in
the
window
,
or
leaning
against
the
wall
,
vacantly
swinging
their
bodies
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
a
man
reading
an
old
newspaper
,
in
two
or
three
instances
,
this
was
the
case
in
every
ward
we
entered
.
   
<EOS>
The
only
communication
these
men
have
with
their
friends
,
is
through
two
close
iron
gratings
,
with
an
intermediate
space
of
about
a
yard
in
width
between
the
two
,
so
that
nothing
can
be
handed
across
,
nor
can
the
prisoner
have
any
communication
by
touch
with
the
person
who
visits
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
married
men
have
a
separate
grating
,
at
which
to
see
their
wives
,
but
its
construction
is
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
The
prison
chapel
is
situated
at
the
back
of
the
governor
's
house
:
<EOS>
the
latter
having
no
windows
looking
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
associations
connected
with
the
place
---
the
knowledge
that
here
a
portion
of
the
burial
service
is
,
on
some
dreadful
occasions
,
performed
over
the
quick
and
not
upon
the
dead
---
cast
over
it
a
still
more
gloomy
and
sombre
air
than
art
has
imparted
to
it
,
we
know
not
,
but
its
appearance
is
very
striking
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
in
a
silent
and
deserted
place
of
worship
,
solemn
and
impressive
at
any
time
;
and
the
very
dissimilarity
of
this
one
from
any
we
have
been
accustomed
to
,
only
enhances
the
impression
.
 
<EOS>
The
meanness
of
its
appointments
---
the
bare
and
scanty
pulpit
,
with
the
paltry
painted
pillars
on
either
side
---
the
women
's
gallery
with
its
great
heavy
curtain
---
<EOS>
the
men
's
with
its
unpainted
benches
and
dingy
front
---
the
tottering
little
table
at
the
altar
,
with
the
commandments
on
the
wall
above
it
,
scarcely
legible
through
lack
of
paint
,
and
dust
and
damp
---
so
unlike
the
velvet
and
gilding
,
the
marble
and
wood
,
of
a
modern
church
---
are
strange
and
striking
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
one
object
,
too
,
which
rivets
the
attention
and
fascinates
the
gaze
,
and
from
which
we
may
turn
horror
-
stricken
in
vain
,
for
the
recollection
of
it
will
haunt
us
,
waking
and
sleeping
,
for
a
long
time
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
below
the
reading
-
desk
,
on
the
floor
of
the
chapel
,
and
forming
the
most
conspicuous
object
in
its
little
area
,
is
THE
CONDEMNED
PEW
;
a
huge
black
pen
,
in
which
the
wretched
people
,
who
are
singled
out
for
death
,
are
placed
on
the
Sunday
preceding
their
execution
,
in
sight
of
all
their
fellow
-
prisoners
,
from
many
of
whom
they
may
have
been
separated
but
a
week
before
,
to
hear
prayers
for
their
own
souls
,
to
join
in
the
responses
of
their
own
burial
service
,
and
to
listen
to
an
address
,
warning
their
recent
companions
to
take
example
by
their
fate
,
and
urging
themselves
,
while
there
is
yet
time
---
nearly
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
---
to
"
turn
,
and
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come
!
"
<EOS>
Imagine
what
have
been
the
feelings
of
the
men
whom
that
fearful
pew
has
enclosed
,
and
of
whom
,
between
the
gallows
and
the
knife
,
no
mortal
remnant
may
now
remain
!
 
<EOS>
Think
of
the
hopeless
clinging
to
life
to
the
last
,
and
the
wild
despair
,
far
exceeding
in
anguish
the
felon
's
death
itself
,
by
which
they
have
heard
the
certainty
of
their
speedy
transmission
to
another
world
,
with
all
their
crimes
upon
their
heads
,
rung
into
their
ears
by
the
officiating
clergyman
!
   
<EOS>
At
one
time
---
and
at
no
distant
period
either
---
the
coffins
of
the
men
about
to
be
executed
,
were
placed
in
that
pew
,
upon
the
seat
by
their
side
,
during
the
whole
service
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
seem
incredible
,
but
it
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
that
the
increased
spirit
of
civilisation
and
humanity
which
abolished
this
frightful
and
degrading
custom
,
may
extend
itself
to
other
usages
equally
barbarous
;
usages
which
have
not
even
the
plea
of
utility
in
their
defence
,
as
every
year
's
experience
has
shown
them
to
be
more
and
more
inefficacious
.
   
<EOS>
Leaving
the
chapel
,
descending
to
the
passage
so
frequently
alluded
to
,
and
crossing
the
yard
before
noticed
as
being
allotted
to
prisoners
of
a
more
respectable
description
than
the
generality
of
men
confined
here
,
the
visitor
arrives
at
a
thick
iron
gate
of
great
size
and
strength
.
 
<EOS>
Having
been
admitted
through
it
by
the
turnkey
on
duty
,
he
turns
sharp
round
to
the
left
,
and
pauses
before
another
gate
;
and
,
having
passed
this
last
barrier
,
he
stands
in
the
most
terrible
part
of
this
gloomy
building
---
the
condemned
ward
.
   
<EOS>
The
press
-
yard
,
well
known
by
name
to
newspaper
readers
,
from
its
frequent
mention
in
accounts
of
executions
,
is
at
the
corner
of
the
building
,
and
next
to
the
ordinary
's
house
,
in
Newgate
-
street
:
running
from
Newgate
-
street
,
towards
the
centre
of
the
prison
,
parallel
with
Newgate
-
market
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
long
,
narrow
court
,
of
which
a
portion
of
the
wall
in
Newgate
-
street
forms
one
end
,
and
the
gate
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
upper
end
,
on
the
left
hand
---
that
is
,
adjoining
the
wall
in
Newgate
-
street
---
is
a
cistern
of
water
,
and
at
the
bottom
a
double
grating
(
of
which
the
gate
itself
forms
a
part
)
similar
to
that
before
described
.
 
<EOS>
Through
these
grates
the
prisoners
are
allowed
to
see
their
friends
;
a
turnkey
always
remaining
in
the
vacant
space
between
,
during
the
whole
interview
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
the
right
as
you
enter
,
is
a
building
containing
the
press
-
room
,
day
-
room
,
and
cells
;
the
yard
is
on
every
side
surrounded
by
lofty
walls
guarded
by
CHEVAUX
DE
FRISE
;
and
the
whole
is
under
the
constant
inspection
of
vigilant
and
experienced
turnkeys
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
first
apartment
into
which
we
were
conducted
---
which
was
at
the
top
of
a
staircase
,
and
immediately
over
the
press
-
room
---
were
five
-
and
-
twenty
or
thirty
prisoners
,
all
under
sentence
of
death
,
awaiting
the
result
of
the
recorder
's
report
---
men
of
all
ages
and
appearances
,
from
a
hardened
old
offender
with
swarthy
face
and
grizzly
beard
of
three
days
'
growth
,
to
a
handsome
boy
,
not
fourteen
years
old
,
and
of
singularly
youthful
appearance
even
for
that
age
,
who
had
been
condemned
for
burglary
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
appearance
of
these
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
two
decently
-
dressed
men
were
brooding
with
a
dejected
air
over
the
fire
;
several
little
groups
of
two
or
three
had
been
engaged
in
conversation
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
or
in
the
windows
;
and
the
remainder
were
crowded
round
a
young
man
seated
at
a
table
,
who
appeared
to
be
engaged
in
teaching
the
younger
ones
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
large
,
airy
,
and
clean
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
very
little
anxiety
or
mental
suffering
depicted
in
the
countenance
of
any
of
the
men
;
---
they
had
all
been
sentenced
to
death
,
it
is
true
,
and
the
recorder
's
report
had
not
yet
been
made
;
but
,
we
question
whether
there
was
a
man
among
them
,
notwithstanding
,
who
did
not
KNOW
that
although
he
had
undergone
the
ceremony
,
it
never
was
intended
that
his
life
should
be
sacrificed
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
table
lay
a
Testament
,
but
there
were
no
tokens
of
its
having
been
in
recent
use
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
press
-
room
below
,
were
three
men
,
the
nature
of
whose
offence
rendered
it
necessary
to
separate
them
,
even
from
their
companions
in
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
long
,
sombre
room
,
with
two
windows
sunk
into
the
stone
wall
,
and
here
the
wretched
men
are
pinioned
on
the
morning
of
their
execution
,
before
moving
towards
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
The
fate
of
one
of
these
prisoners
was
uncertain
;
some
mitigatory
circumstances
having
come
to
light
since
his
trial
,
which
had
been
humanely
represented
in
the
proper
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
two
had
nothing
to
expect
from
the
mercy
of
the
crown
;
their
doom
was
sealed
;
no
plea
could
be
urged
in
extenuation
of
their
crime
,
and
they
well
knew
that
for
them
there
was
no
hope
in
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
two
short
ones
,
"
the
turnkey
whispered
,
"
were
dead
men
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
to
whom
we
have
alluded
as
entertaining
some
hopes
of
escape
,
was
lounging
,
at
the
greatest
distance
he
could
place
between
himself
and
his
companions
,
in
the
window
nearest
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
probably
aware
of
our
approach
,
and
had
assumed
an
air
of
courageous
indifference
;
his
face
was
purposely
averted
towards
the
window
,
and
he
stirred
not
an
inch
while
we
were
present
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
two
men
were
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
who
was
imperfectly
seen
in
the
dim
light
,
had
his
back
towards
us
,
and
was
stooping
over
the
fire
,
with
his
right
arm
on
the
mantel
-
piece
,
and
his
head
sunk
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
was
leaning
on
the
sill
of
the
farthest
window
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
fell
full
upon
him
,
and
communicated
to
his
pale
,
haggard
face
,
and
disordered
hair
,
an
appearance
which
,
at
that
distance
,
was
ghastly
.
 
<EOS>
His
cheek
rested
upon
his
hand
;
and
,
with
his
face
a
little
raised
,
and
his
eyes
wildly
staring
before
him
,
he
seemed
to
be
unconsciously
intent
on
counting
the
chinks
in
the
opposite
wall
.
 
<EOS>
We
passed
this
room
again
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
man
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
court
with
a
firm
military
step
<EOS>
---
he
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
foot
-
guards
---
and
a
cloth
cap
jauntily
thrown
on
one
side
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
respectfully
to
our
conductor
,
and
the
salute
was
returned
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
two
still
remained
in
the
positions
we
have
described
,
and
were
as
motionless
as
statues
.
<EOS>
(

A
few
paces
up
the
yard
,
and
forming
a
continuation
of
the
building
,
in
which
are
the
two
rooms
we
have
just
quitted
,
lie
the
condemned
cells
.
 
<EOS>
The
entrance
is
by
a
narrow
and
obscure
stair
-
case
leading
to
a
dark
passage
,
in
which
a
charcoal
stove
casts
a
lurid
tint
over
the
objects
in
its
immediate
vicinity
,
and
diffuses
something
like
warmth
around
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
left
-
hand
side
of
this
passage
,
the
massive
door
of
every
cell
on
the
story
opens
;
and
from
it
alone
can
they
be
approached
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
three
of
these
passages
,
and
three
of
these
ranges
of
cells
,
one
above
the
other
;
but
in
size
,
furniture
and
appearance
,
they
are
all
precisely
alike
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
to
the
recorder
's
report
being
made
,
all
the
prisoners
under
sentence
of
death
are
removed
from
the
day
-
room
at
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
locked
up
in
these
cells
,
where
they
are
allowed
a
candle
until
ten
o'clock
;
and
here
they
remain
until
seven
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
warrant
for
a
prisoner
's
execution
arrives
,
he
is
removed
to
the
cells
and
confined
in
one
of
them
until
he
leaves
it
for
the
scaffold
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
at
liberty
to
walk
in
the
yard
;
but
,
both
in
his
walks
and
in
his
cell
,
he
is
constantly
attended
by
a
turnkey
who
never
leaves
him
on
any
pretence
.
   
<EOS>
We
entered
the
first
cell
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
stone
dungeon
,
eight
feet
long
by
six
wide
,
with
a
bench
at
the
upper
end
,
under
which
were
a
common
rug
,
a
bible
,
and
prayer
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
An
iron
candlestick
was
fixed
into
the
wall
at
the
side
;
and
a
small
high
window
in
the
back
admitted
as
much
air
and
light
as
could
struggle
in
between
a
double
row
of
heavy
,
crossed
iron
bars
.
 
<EOS>
It
contained
no
other
furniture
of
any
description
.
   
<EOS>
Conceive
the
situation
of
a
man
,
spending
his
last
night
on
earth
in
this
cell
.
 
<EOS>
Buoyed
up
with
some
vague
and
undefined
hope
of
reprieve
,
he
knew
not
why
---
<EOS>
indulging
in
some
wild
and
visionary
idea
of
escaping
,
he
knew
not
how
---
hour
after
hour
of
the
three
preceding
days
allowed
him
for
preparation
,
has
fled
with
a
speed
which
no
man
living
would
deem
possible
,
for
none
but
<EOS>
this
dying
man
can
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
wearied
his
friends
with
entreaties
,
exhausted
the
attendants
with
importunities
,
neglected
in
his
feverish
restlessness
the
timely
warnings
of
his
spiritual
consoler
;
and
,
now
that
the
illusion
is
at
last
dispelled
,
now
that
eternity
is
before
him
and
guilt
behind
,
now
that
his
fears
of
death
amount
almost
to
madness
,
and
an
overwhelming
sense
of
his
helpless
,
hopeless
state
rushes
upon
him
,
he
is
lost
and
stupefied
,
and
has
neither
thoughts
to
turn
to
,
nor
power
to
call
upon
,
the
Almighty
Being
,
from
whom
alone
he
can
seek
mercy
and
forgiveness
,
and
before
whom
his
repentance
can
alone
avail
.
   
<EOS>
Hours
have
glided
by
,
and
still
he
sits
upon
the
same
stone
bench
with
folded
arms
,
heedless
alike
of
the
fast
decreasing
time
before
him
,
and
the
urgent
entreaties
of
the
good
man
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
The
feeble
light
is
wasting
gradually
,
and
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
street
without
,
broken
only
by
the
rumbling
of
some
passing
vehicle
which
echoes
mournfully
through
the
empty
yards
,
warns
him
that
the
night
is
waning
fast
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
deep
bell
of
St
Paul
's
strikes
---
one
!
 
<EOS>
He
heard
it
;
it
has
roused
him
.
 
<EOS>
Seven
hours
left
!
<EOS>
He
paces
the
narrow
limits
of
his
cell
with
rapid
strides
,
cold
drops
of
terror
starting
on
his
forehead
,
and
every
muscle
of
his
frame
quivering
with
agony
.
 
<EOS>
Seven
hours
!
 
<EOS>
He
suffers
himself
to
be
led
to
his
seat
,
mechanically
takes
the
bible
which
is
placed
in
his
hand
,
and
tries
to
read
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
No
:
 
his
thoughts
will
wander
.
 
<EOS>
The
book
is
torn
and
soiled
by
use
---
and
like
the
book
he
read
his
lessons
in
,
at
school
,
just
forty
years
ago
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
never
bestowed
a
thought
upon
it
,
perhaps
,
since
he
left
it
as
a
child
:
and
yet
the
place
,
the
time
,
the
room
---
nay
,
the
very
boys
he
played
with
,
crowd
as
vividly
before
him
as
if
they
were
scenes
of
yesterday
;
and
some
forgotten
phrase
,
some
childish
word
,
rings
in
his
ears
like
the
echo
of
one
uttered
but
a
minute
since
.
 
<EOS>
The
voice
of
the
clergyman
recalls
him
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
reading
from
the
sacred
book
its
solemn
promises
of
pardon
for
repentance
,
and
its
awful
denunciation
of
obdurate
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
falls
upon
his
knees
and
clasps
his
hands
to
pray
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
what
sound
was
that
?
 
<EOS>
He
starts
upon
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
two
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
Two
quarters
have
struck
;
 
---
the
third
---
the
fourth
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
!
 
<EOS>
Six
hours
left
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
not
of
repentance
!
 
<EOS>
Six
hours
'
repentance
for
eight
times
six
years
of
guilt
and
sin
!
 
<EOS>
He
buries
his
face
in
his
hands
,
and
throws
himself
on
the
bench
.
   
<EOS>
Worn
with
watching
and
excitement
,
he
sleeps
,
and
the
same
unsettled
state
of
mind
pursues
him
in
his
dreams
.
 
<EOS>
An
insupportable
load
is
taken
from
his
breast
;
he
is
walking
with
his
wife
in
a
pleasant
field
,
with
the
bright
sky
above
them
,
and
a
fresh
and
boundless
prospect
on
every
side
---
how
different
from
the
stone
walls
of
Newgate
!
 
<EOS>
She
is
looking
---
not
as
she
did
when
he
saw
her
for
the
last
time
in
that
dreadful
place
,
but
as
she
used
when
he
loved
her
---
long
,
long
ago
,
before
misery
and
ill
-
treatment
had
altered
her
looks
,
and
vice
had
changed
his
nature
,
and
she
is
leaning
upon
his
arm
,
and
looking
up
into
his
face
with
tenderness
and
affection
---
and
he
does
NOT
strike
her
now
,
nor
rudely
shake
her
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
glad
he
is
to
tell
her
all
he
had
forgotten
in
that
last
hurried
interview
,
and
to
fall
on
his
knees
before
her
and
fervently
beseech
her
pardon
for
all
the
unkindness
and
cruelty
that
wasted
her
form
and
broke
her
heart
!
 
<EOS>
The
scene
suddenly
changes
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
on
his
trial
again
:
 
<EOS>
there
are
the
judge
and
jury
,
and
prosecutors
,
and
witnesses
,
just
as
they
were
before
.
<EOS>
How
full
the
court
is
---
what
a
sea
of
heads
---
with
a
gallows
,
too
,
and
a
scaffold
---
and
how
all
those
people
stare
at
HIM
!
 
<EOS>
Verdict
,
"
Guilty
.
"
 
<EOS>
No
matter
;
he
will
escape
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
is
dark
and
cold
,
the
gates
have
been
left
open
,
and
in
an
instant
he
is
in
the
street
,
flying
from
the
scene
of
his
imprisonment
like
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
are
cleared
,
the
open
fields
are
gained
and
the
broad
,
wide
country
lies
before
him
.
<EOS>
Onward
he
dashes
in
the
midst
of
darkness
,
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
through
mud
and
pool
,
bounding
from
spot
to
spot
with
a
speed
and
lightness
,
astonishing
even
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
pauses
;
he
must
be
safe
from
pursuit
now
;
he
will
stretch
himself
on
that
bank
and
sleep
till
sunrise
.
   
<EOS>
A
period
of
unconsciousness
succeeds
.
 
<EOS>
He
wakes
,
cold
and
wretched
.
<EOS>
The
dull
,
gray
light
of
morning
is
stealing
into
the
cell
,
and
falls
upon
the
form
of
the
attendant
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
Confused
by
his
dreams
,
he
starts
from
his
uneasy
bed
in
momentary
uncertainty
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
but
momentary
.
 
<EOS>
Every
object
in
the
narrow
cell
is
too
frightfully
real
to
admit
of
doubt
or
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
condemned
felon
again
,
guilty
and
despairing
;
and
in
two
hours
more
will
be
dead
.
    
<EOS>
CHARACTERS
 
Thoughts
about
people
<EOS>
It
is
strange
with
how
little
notice
,
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
,
a
man
may
live
and
die
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
awakens
no
sympathy
in
the
breast
of
any
single
person
;
his
existence
is
a
matter
of
interest
to
no
one
save
himself
;
he
can
not
be
said
to
be
forgotten
when
he
dies
,
for
no
one
<EOS>
remembered
him
when
he
was
alive
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
numerous
class
of
people
in
this
great
metropolis
who
seem
not
to
possess
a
single
friend
,
and
whom
nobody
appears
to
care
for
.
<EOS>
Urged
by
imperative
necessity
in
the
first
instance
,
they
have
resorted
to
London
in
search
of
employment
,
and
the
means
of
subsistence
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
hard
,
we
know
,
to
break
the
ties
which
bind
us
to
our
homes
and
friends
,
and
harder
still
to
efface
the
thousand
recollections
of
happy
days
and
old
times
,
which
have
been
slumbering
in
our
bosoms
for
years
,
and
only
rush
upon
the
mind
,
to
bring
before
it
associations
connected
with
the
friends
we
have
left
,
the
scenes
we
have
beheld
too
probably
for
the
last
time
,
and
the
hopes
we
once
cherished
,
but
may
entertain
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
These
men
,
however
,
happily
for
themselves
,
have
long
forgotten
such
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Old
country
friends
have
died
or
emigrated
;
former
correspondents
have
become
lost
,
like
themselves
,
in
the
crowd
and
turmoil
of
some
busy
city
;
and
they
have
gradually
settled
down
into
mere
passive
creatures
of
habit
and
endurance
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
seated
in
the
enclosure
of
St
James
's
Park
the
other
day
,
when
our
attention
was
attracted
by
a
man
whom
we
immediately
put
down
in
our
own
mind
as
one
of
this
class
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
thin
,
pale
person
,
in
a
black
coat
,
scanty
gray
trousers
,
little
pinched
-
up
gaiters
,
and
brown
beaver
gloves
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
an
umbrella
in
his
hand
---
not
for
use
,
for
the
day
was
fine
---
but
,
evidently
,
because
he
always
carried
one
to
the
office
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
up
and
down
before
the
little
patch
of
grass
on
which
the
chairs
are
placed
for
hire
,
not
as
if
he
were
doing
it
for
pleasure
or
recreation
,
but
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
compulsion
,
just
as
he
would
walk
to
the
office
every
morning
from
the
back
settlements
of
Islington
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Monday
;
he
had
escaped
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
from
the
thraldom
of
the
desk
;
and
was
walking
here
for
exercise
and
amusement
---
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
inclined
to
think
he
had
never
had
a
holiday
before
,
and
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Children
were
playing
on
the
grass
;
groups
of
people
were
loitering
about
,
chatting
and
laughing
;
but
the
man
walked
steadily
up
and
down
,
unheeding
and
unheeded
his
spare
,
pale
face
looking
as
if
it
were
incapable
of
bearing
the
expression
of
curiosity
or
interest
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
man
's
manner
and
appearance
which
told
us
,
we
fancied
,
his
whole
life
,
or
rather
his
whole
day
,
for
a
man
of
this
sort
has
no
variety
of
days
.
 
<EOS>
We
thought
we
almost
saw
the
dingy
little
back
office
into
which
he
walks
every
morning
,
hanging
his
hat
on
the
same
peg
,
and
placing
his
legs
beneath
the
same
desk
:
 
first
,
taking
off
that
black
coat
which
lasts
the
year
through
,
and
putting
on
the
one
which
did
duty
last
year
,
and
which
he
keeps
in
his
desk
to
save
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
sits
till
five
o'clock
,
working
on
,
all
day
,
as
regularly
as
the
dial
over
the
mantel
-
piece
,
whose
loud
ticking
is
as
monotonous
as
his
whole
existence
:
 
<EOS>
only
raising
his
head
when
some
one
enters
the
counting
-
house
,
or
when
,
in
the
midst
of
some
difficult
calculation
,
he
looks
up
to
the
ceiling
as
if
there
were
inspiration
in
the
dusty
skylight
with
a
green
knot
in
the
centre
of
every
pane
of
glass
.
 
<EOS>
About
five
,
or
half
-
past
,
he
slowly
dismounts
from
his
accustomed
stool
,
and
again
changing
his
coat
,
proceeds
to
his
usual
dining
-
place
,
somewhere
near
Bucklersbury
.
<EOS>
The
waiter
recites
the
bill
of
fare
in
a
rather
confidential
manner
---
for
he
is
a
regular
customer
---
and
after
inquiring
"
What
's
in
the
best
cut
?
"
<EOS>
and
"
What
was
up
last
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
orders
a
small
plate
of
roast
beef
,
with
greens
,
and
half
-
a
-
pint
of
porter
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
small
plate
to
-
day
,
because
greens
are
a
penny
more
than
potatoes
,
and
he
had
"
two
breads
"
yesterday
,
with
the
additional
enormity
of
"
a
cheese
"
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
This
important
point
settled
,
he
hangs
up
his
hat
<EOS>
---
he
took
it
off
the
moment
he
sat
down
---
and
bespeaks
the
paper
after
the
next
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
can
get
it
while
he
is
at
dinner
,
he
eats
with
much
greater
zest
;
balancing
it
against
the
water
-
bottle
,
and
eating
a
bit
of
beef
,
and
reading
a
line
or
two
,
alternately
.
 
<EOS>
Exactly
at
five
minutes
before
the
hour
is
up
,
he
produces
a
shilling
,
pays
the
reckoning
,
carefully
deposits
the
change
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
(
first
deducting
a
penny
for
the
waiter
)
,
and
returns
to
the
office
,
from
which
,
if
it
is
not
foreign
post
night
,
he
again
sallies
forth
,
in
about
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
He
then
walks
home
,
at
his
usual
pace
,
to
his
little
back
room
at
Islington
,
where
he
has
his
tea
;
perhaps
solacing
himself
during
the
meal
with
the
conversation
of
his
landlady
's
little
boy
,
whom
he
occasionally
rewards
with
a
penny
,
for
solving
problems
in
simple
addition
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
there
is
a
letter
or
two
to
take
up
to
his
employer
's
,
in
Russell
-
square
;
and
then
,
the
wealthy
man
of
business
,
hearing
his
voice
,
calls
out
from
the
dining
-
parlour
,
---
"
Come
in
,
Mr
Smith
:
"
and
Mr
Smith
,
putting
his
hat
at
the
feet
of
one
of
the
hall
chairs
,
walks
timidly
in
,
and
being
condescendingly
desired
to
sit
down
,
carefully
tucks
his
legs
under
his
chair
,
and
sits
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
table
while
he
drinks
the
glass
of
sherry
which
is
poured
out
for
him
by
the
eldest
boy
,
and
after
drinking
which
,
he
backs
and
slides
out
of
the
room
,
in
a
state
of
nervous
agitation
from
which
he
does
not
perfectly
recover
,
until
he
finds
himself
once
more
in
the
Islington
-
road
.
<EOS>
Poor
,
harmless
creatures
such
men
are
;
contented
but
not
happy
;
broken
-
spirited
and
humbled
,
they
may
feel
no
pain
,
but
they
never
know
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
Compare
these
men
with
another
class
of
beings
who
,
like
them
,
have
neither
friend
nor
companion
,
but
whose
position
in
society
is
the
result
of
their
own
choice
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
generally
old
fellows
with
white
heads
and
red
faces
,
addicted
to
port
wine
and
Hessian
boots
,
who
from
some
cause
,
real
or
imaginary
---
generally
the
former
,
<EOS>
the
excellent
reason
being
that
they
are
rich
,
and
their
relations
poor
---
grow
suspicious
of
everybody
,
and
do
the
misanthropical
in
chambers
,
taking
great
delight
in
thinking
themselves
unhappy
,
and
making
everybody
they
come
near
,
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
see
such
men
as
these
,
anywhere
;
you
will
know
them
at
coffee
-
houses
by
their
discontented
exclamations
and
the
luxury
of
their
dinners
;
at
theatres
,
by
their
always
sitting
in
the
same
place
and
looking
with
a
jaundiced
eye
on
all
the
young
people
near
them
;
at
church
,
by
the
pomposity
with
which
they
enter
,
and
the
loud
tone
in
which
they
repeat
the
responses
;
at
parties
,
by
their
getting
cross
at
whist
and
hating
music
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
fellow
of
this
kind
will
have
his
chambers
splendidly
furnished
,
and
collect
books
,
plate
,
and
pictures
about
him
in
profusion
;
not
so
much
for
his
own
gratification
,
as
to
be
superior
to
those
who
have
the
desire
,
but
not
the
means
,
to
compete
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
belongs
to
two
or
three
clubs
,
and
is
envied
,
and
flattered
,
and
hated
by
the
members
of
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
will
be
appealed
to
by
a
poor
relation
---
a
married
nephew
perhaps
---
for
some
little
assistance
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
will
declaim
with
honest
indignation
on
the
improvidence
of
young
married
people
,
the
worthlessness
of
a
wife
,
the
insolence
of
having
a
family
,
the
atrocity
of
getting
into
debt
with
a
hundred
and
twenty
-
five
pounds
a
year
,
and
other
unpardonable
crimes
;
winding
up
his
exhortations
with
a
complacent
review
of
his
own
conduct
,
and
a
delicate
allusion
to
parochial
relief
.
 
<EOS>
He
dies
,
some
day
after
dinner
,
of
apoplexy
,
having
bequeathed
his
property
to
a
Public
Society
,
and
the
Institution
erects
a
tablet
to
his
memory
,
expressive
of
their
admiration
of
his
Christian
conduct
in
this
world
,
and
their
comfortable
conviction
of
his
happiness
in
the
next
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
next
to
our
very
particular
friends
,
hackney
-
coachmen
,
cabmen
and
cads
,
whom
we
admire
in
proportion
to
the
extent
of
their
cool
impudence
and
perfect
self
-
possession
,
there
is
no
class
of
people
who
amuse
us
more
than
London
apprentices
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
no
longer
an
organised
body
,
bound
down
by
solemn
compact
to
terrify
his
Majesty
's
subjects
whenever
it
pleases
them
to
take
offence
in
their
heads
and
staves
in
their
hands
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
only
bound
,
now
,
by
indentures
,
and
,
as
to
their
valour
,
it
is
easily
restrained
by
the
wholesome
dread
of
the
New
Police
,
and
a
perspective
view
of
a
damp
station
-
house
,
terminating
in
a
police
-
office
and
a
reprimand
.
<EOS>
They
are
still
,
however
,
a
peculiar
class
,
and
not
the
less
pleasant
for
being
inoffensive
.
 
<EOS>
Can
any
one
fail
to
have
noticed
them
in
the
streets
on
Sunday
?
 
<EOS>
And
were
there
ever
such
harmless
efforts
at
the
grand
and
magnificent
as
the
young
fellows
display
!
<EOS>
We
walked
down
the
Strand
,
a
Sunday
or
two
ago
,
behind
a
little
group
;
and
they
furnished
food
for
our
amusement
the
whole
way
.
<EOS>
They
had
come
out
of
some
part
of
the
city
;
it
was
between
three
and
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
and
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
four
of
them
,
all
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
with
white
kid
gloves
like
so
many
bridegrooms
,
light
trousers
of
unprecedented
patterns
,
and
coats
for
which
the
English
language
has
yet
no
name
---
a
kind
of
cross
between
a
great
-
coat
and
a
surtout
,
with
the
collar
of
the
one
,
the
skirts
of
the
other
,
and
pockets
peculiar
to
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
Each
of
the
gentlemen
carried
a
thick
stick
,
with
a
large
tassel
at
the
top
,
which
he
occasionally
twirled
gracefully
round
;
and
the
whole
four
,
by
way
of
looking
easy
and
unconcerned
,
were
walking
with
a
paralytic
swagger
irresistibly
ludicrous
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
party
had
a
watch
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
reasonable
Ribstone
pippin
,
jammed
into
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
which
he
carefully
compared
with
the
clocks
at
St
Clement
's
and
the
New
Church
,
the
illuminated
clock
at
Exeter
"
Change
,
the
clock
of
St
Martin
's
Church
,
and
the
clock
of
the
Horse
Guards
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
at
last
arrived
in
St
James
's
Park
,
the
member
of
the
party
who
had
the
best
-
made
boots
on
,
hired
a
second
chair
expressly
for
his
feet
,
and
flung
himself
on
this
two
-
pennyworth
of
sylvan
luxury
with
an
air
which
levelled
all
distinctions
between
Brookes
's
and
Snooks
's
,
Crockford
's
and
Bagnigge
Wells
.
   
<EOS>
We
may
smile
at
such
people
,
but
they
can
never
excite
our
anger
.
<EOS>
They
are
usually
on
the
best
terms
with
themselves
,
and
it
follows
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
,
in
good
humour
with
every
one
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
they
are
always
the
faint
reflection
of
higher
lights
;
and
,
if
they
do
display
a
little
occasional
foolery
in
their
own
proper
persons
,
it
is
surely
more
tolerable
than
precocious
puppyism
in
the
Quadrant
,
whiskered
dandyism
in
Regent
-
street
and
Pall
-
mall
,
or
gallantry
in
its
dotage
anywhere
.
   
<EOS>
A
Christmas
dinner
Christmas
time
!
 
<EOS>
That
man
must
be
a
misanthrope
indeed
,
in
whose
breast
something
like
a
jovial
feeling
is
not
roused
---
in
whose
mind
some
pleasant
associations
are
not
awakened
---
by
the
recurrence
of
Christmas
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
people
who
will
tell
you
that
Christmas
is
not
to
them
what
it
used
to
be
;
that
each
succeeding
Christmas
has
found
some
cherished
hope
,
or
happy
prospect
,
of
the
year
before
,
dimmed
or
passed
away
;
that
the
present
only
serves
to
remind
them
of
reduced
circumstances
and
straitened
incomes
---
of
the
feasts
they
once
bestowed
on
hollow
friends
,
and
of
the
cold
looks
that
meet
them
now
,
in
adversity
and
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
Never
heed
such
dismal
reminiscences
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
few
men
who
have
lived
long
enough
in
the
world
,
who
can
not
call
up
such
thoughts
any
day
in
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
Then
do
not
select
the
merriest
of
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
-
five
for
your
doleful
recollections
,
but
draw
your
chair
nearer
the
blazing
fire
---
fill
the
glass
and
send
round
the
song
---
and
if
your
room
be
smaller
than
it
was
a
dozen
years
ago
,
or
if
your
glass
be
filled
with
reeking
punch
,
instead
of
sparkling
wine
,
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
,
and
empty
it
off
-
hand
,
and
fill
another
,
and
troll
off
the
old
ditty
you
used
to
sing
,
and
thank
God
it
's
no
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Look
on
the
merry
faces
of
your
children
(
if
you
have
any
)
as
they
sit
round
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
One
little
seat
may
be
empty
;
one
slight
form
that
gladdened
the
father
's
heart
,
and
roused
the
mother
's
pride
to
look
upon
,
may
not
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
Dwell
not
upon
the
past
;
think
not
that
one
short
year
ago
,
the
fair
child
now
resolving
into
dust
,
sat
before
you
,
with
the
bloom
of
health
upon
its
cheek
,
and
the
gaiety
of
infancy
in
its
joyous
eye
.
<EOS>
Reflect
upon
your
present
blessings
---
of
which
every
man
has
many
---
not
on
your
past
misfortunes
,
of
which
all
men
have
some
.
 
<EOS>
Fill
your
glass
again
,
with
a
merry
face
and
contented
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Our
life
on
it
,
but
your
Christmas
shall
be
merry
,
and
your
new
year
a
happy
one

<EOS>
Who
can
be
insensible
to
the
outpourings
of
good
feeling
,
and
the
honest
interchange
of
affectionate
attachment
,
which
abound
at
this
season
of
the

A
Christmas
family
-
party
!
 
<EOS>
We
know
nothing
in
nature
more
delightful
!
 
<EOS>
There
seems
a
magic
in
the
very
name
of
Christmas
.
 
<EOS>
Petty
jealousies
and
discords
are
forgotten
;
social
feelings
are
awakened
,
in
bosoms
to
which
they
have
long
been
strangers
;
father
and
son
,
or
brother
and
sister
,
who
have
met
and
passed
with
averted
gaze
,
or
a
look
of
cold
recognition
,
for
months
before
,
proffer
and
return
the
cordial
embrace
,
and
bury
their
past
animosities
in
their
present
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Kindly
hearts
that
have
yearned
towards
each
other
,
but
have
been
withheld
by
false
notions
of
pride
and
self
-
dignity
,
are
again
reunited
,
and
all
is
kindness
and
benevolence
!
 
<EOS>
Would
that
Christmas
lasted
the
whole
year
through
(
as
it
ought
)
,
and
that
the
prejudices
and
passions
which
deform
our
better
nature
,
were
never
called
into
action
among
those
to
whom
they
should
ever
be
strangers
!
   
<EOS>
The
Christmas
family
-
party
that
we
mean
,
is
not
a
mere
assemblage
of
relations
,
got
up
at
a
week
or
two
's
notice
,
originating
this
year
,
having
no
family
precedent
in
the
last
,
and
not
likely
to
be
repeated
in
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
annual
gathering
of
all
the
accessible
members
of
the
family
,
young
or
old
,
rich
or
poor
;
and
all
the
children
look
forward
to
it
,
for
two
months
beforehand
,
in
a
fever
of
anticipation
.
 
<EOS>
Formerly
,
it
was
held
at
grandpapa
's
;
but
grandpapa
getting
old
,
and
grandmamma
getting
old
too
,
and
rather
infirm
,
they
have
given
up
house
-
keeping
,
and
domesticated
themselves
with
uncle
George
;
so
,
the
party
always
takes
place
at
uncle
George
's
house
,
but
grandmamma
sends
in
most
of
the
good
things
,
and
grandpapa
always
WILL
toddle
down
,
all
the
way
to
Newgate
-
market
,
to
buy
the
turkey
,
which
he
engages
a
porter
to
bring
home
behind
him
in
triumph
,
always
insisting
on
the
man
's
being
rewarded
with
a
glass
of
spirits
,
over
and
above
his
hire
,
to
drink
"
a
merry
Christmas
and
a
happy
new
year
"
to
aunt
George
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
grandmamma
,
she
is
very
secret
and
mysterious
for
two
or
three
days
beforehand
,
but
not
sufficiently
so
,
to
prevent
rumours
getting
afloat
that
she
has
purchased
a
beautiful
new
cap
with
pink
ribbons
for
each
of
the
servants
,
together
with
sundry
books
,
and
pen
-
knives
,
and
pencil
-
cases
,
for
the
younger
branches
;
to
say
nothing
of
divers
secret
additions
to
the
order
originally
given
by
aunt
George
at
the
pastry
-
cook
's
,
such
as
another
dozen
of
mince
-
pies
for
the
dinner
,
and
a
large
plum
-
cake
for
the
children
.
   
<EOS>
On
Christmas
-
eve
,
grandmamma
is
always
in
excellent
spirits
,
and
after
employing
all
the
children
,
during
the
day
,
in
stoning
the
plums
,
and
all
that
,
insists
,
regularly
every
year
,
on
uncle
George
coming
down
into
the
kitchen
,
taking
off
his
coat
,
and
stirring
the
pudding
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
which
uncle
George
good
-
humouredly
does
,
to
the
vociferous
delight
of
the
children
and
servants
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
concludes
with
a
glorious
game
of
blind
-
man's
-
buff
,
in
an
early
stage
of
which
<EOS>
grandpapa
takes
great
care
to
be
caught
,
in
order
that
he
may
have
an
opportunity
of
displaying
his
dexterity
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
the
old
couple
,
with
as
many
of
the
children
as
the
pew
will
hold
,
go
to
church
in
great
state
:
leaving
aunt
George
at
home
dusting
decanters
and
filling
casters
,
and
uncle
George
carrying
bottles
into
the
dining
-
parlour
,
and
calling
for
corkscrews
,
and
getting
into
everybody
's
way
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
church
-
party
return
to
lunch
,
grandpapa
produces
a
small
sprig
of
mistletoe
from
his
pocket
,
and
tempts
the
boys
to
kiss
their
little
cousins
under
it
---
a
proceeding
which
affords
both
the
boys
and
the
old
gentleman
unlimited
satisfaction
,
but
which
rather
outrages
grandmamma
's
ideas
of
decorum
,
until
grandpapa
says
,
that
when
he
was
just
thirteen
years
and
three
months
old
,
HE
kissed
grandmamma
under
a
mistletoe
too
,
on
which
the
children
clap
their
hands
,
and
laugh
very
heartily
,
as
do
aunt
George
and
uncle
George
;
and
grandmamma
looks
pleased
,
and
says
,
with
a
benevolent
smile
,
that
grandpapa
was
an
impudent
young
dog
,
on
which
the
children
laugh
very
heartily
again
,
and
grandpapa
more
heartily
than
any
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
But
all
these
diversions
are
nothing
to
the
subsequent
excitement
when
grandmamma
in
a
high
cap
,
and
slate
-
coloured
silk
gown
;
and
grandpapa
with
a
beautifully
plaited
shirt
-
frill
,
and
white
neckerchief
;
seat
themselves
on
one
side
of
the
drawing
-
room
fire
,
with
uncle
George
's
children
and
little
cousins
innumerable
,
seated
in
the
front
,
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
expected
visitors
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
hackney
-
coach
is
heard
to
stop
,
and
uncle
George
,
who
has
been
looking
out
of
the
window
,
exclaims
"
Here
's
Jane
!
"
<EOS>
on
which
the
children
rush
to
the
door
,
and
helter
-
skelter
down
-
stairs
;
and
uncle
Robert
and
aunt
Jane
,
and
the
dear
little
baby
,
and
the
nurse
,
and
the
whole
party
,
are
ushered
up
-
stairs
amidst
tumultuous
shouts
of
"
Oh
,
my
!
"
<EOS>
from
the
children
,
and
frequently
repeated
warnings
not
to
hurt
baby
from
the
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
And
grandpapa
takes
the
child
,
and
grandmamma
kisses
her
daughter
,
and
the
confusion
of
this
first
entry
has
scarcely
subsided
,
when
some
other
aunts
and
uncles
with
more
cousins
arrive
,
and
the
grown
-
up
cousins
flirt
with
each
other
,
and
so
do
the
little
cousins
too
,
for
that
matter
,
and
nothing
is
to
be
heard
but
a
confused
din
of
talking
,
laughing
,
and
merriment
.
   
<EOS>
A
hesitating
double
knock
at
the
street
-
door
,
heard
during
a
momentary
pause
in
the
conversation
,
excites
a
general
inquiry
of
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
and
two
or
three
children
,
who
have
been
standing
at
the
window
,
announce
in
a
low
voice
,
that
it
's
"
poor
aunt
Margaret
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
aunt
George
leaves
the
room
to
welcome
the
new
-
comer
;
and
grandmamma
draws
herself
up
,
rather
stiff
and
stately
;
for
Margaret
married
a
poor
man
without
her
consent
,
and
poverty
not
being
a
sufficiently
weighty
punishment
for
her
offence
,
has
been
discarded
by
her
friends
,
and
debarred
the
society
of
her
dearest
relatives
.
 
<EOS>
But
Christmas
has
come
round
,
and
the
unkind
feelings
that
have
struggled
against
better
dispositions
during
the
year
,
have
melted
away
before
its
genial
influence
,
like
half
-
formed
ice
beneath
the
morning
sun
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
difficult
in
a
moment
of
angry
feeling
for
a
parent
to
denounce
a
disobedient
child
;
but
,
to
banish
her
at
a
period
of
general
good
-
will
and
hilarity
,
from
the
hearth
,
round
which
she
has
sat
on
so
many
anniversaries
of
the
same
day
,
expanding
by
slow
degrees
from
infancy
to
girlhood
,
and
then
bursting
,
almost
imperceptibly
,
into
a
woman
,
is
widely
different
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
of
conscious
rectitude
,
and
cold
forgiveness
,
which
the
old
lady
has
assumed
,
sits
ill
upon
her
;
and
when
the
poor
girl
is
led
in
by
her
sister
,
pale
in
looks
and
broken
in
hope
---
not
from
poverty
,
for
that
she
could
bear
,
but
from
the
consciousness
of
undeserved
neglect
,
and
unmerited
unkindness
---
it
is
easy
to
see
how
much
of
it
is
assumed
.
 
<EOS>
A
momentary
pause
succeeds
;
the
girl
breaks
suddenly
from
her
sister
and
throws
herself
,
sobbing
,
on
her
mother
's
neck
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
steps
hastily
forward
,
and
takes
her
husband
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Friends
crowd
round
to
offer
their
hearty
congratulations
,
and
happiness
and
harmony
again
prevail
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
the
dinner
,
it
's
perfectly
delightful
---
<EOS>
nothing
goes
wrong
,
and
everybody
is
in
the
very
best
of
spirits
,
and
disposed
to
please
and
be
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
Grandpapa
relates
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
purchase
of
the
turkey
,
with
a
slight
digression
relative
to
the
purchase
of
previous
turkeys
,
on
former
Christmas
-
days
,
which
grandmamma
corroborates
in
the
minutest
particular
.
 
<EOS>
Uncle
George
tells
stories
,
and
carves
poultry
,
and
takes
wine
,
and
jokes
with
the
children
at
the
side
-
table
,
and
winks
at
the
cousins
that
are
making
love
,
or
being
made
love
to
,
and
exhilarates
everybody
with
his
good
humour
and
hospitality
;
and
when
,
at
last
,
a
stout
servant
staggers
in
with
a
gigantic
pudding
,
with
a
sprig
of
holly
in
the
top
,
there
is
such
a
laughing
,
and
shouting
,
and
clapping
of
little
chubby
hands
,
and
kicking
up
of
fat
dumpy
legs
,
as
can
only
be
equalled
by
the
applause
with
which
the
astonishing
feat
of
pouring
lighted
brandy
into
mince
-
pies
,
is
received
by
the
younger
visitors
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
dessert
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
the
wine
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
the
fun
!
 
<EOS>
Such
beautiful
speeches
,
and
SUCH
songs
,
from
aunt
Margaret
's
husband
,
who
turns
out
to
be
such
a
nice
man
,
and
SO
attentive
to
grandmamma
!
 
<EOS>
Even
grandpapa
not
only
sings
his
annual
song
with
unprecedented
vigour
,
but
on
being
honoured
with
an
unanimous
ENCORE
,
according
to
annual
custom
,
actually
comes
out
with
a
new
one
which
nobody
but
grandmamma
ever
heard
before
;
and
a
young
scapegrace
of
a
cousin
,
who
has
been
in
some
disgrace
with
the
old
people
,
for
certain
heinous
sins
of
omission
and
commission
---
neglecting
to
call
,
and
persisting
in
drinking
Burton
Ale
---
astonishes
everybody
into
convulsions
of
laughter
by
volunteering
the
most
extraordinary
comic
songs
that
ever
were
heard
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
the
evening
passes
,
in
a
strain
of
rational
good
-
will
and
cheerfulness
,
doing
more
to
awaken
the
sympathies
of
every
member
of
the
party
in
behalf
of
his
neighbour
,
and
to
perpetuate
their
good
feeling
during
the
ensuing
year
,
than
half
the
homilies
that
have
ever
been
written
,
by
half
the
Divines
that

ever

The
New
Year
Next
to
Christmas
-
day
,
the
most
pleasant
annual
epoch
in
existence
is
the
advent
of
the
New
Year
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
a
lachrymose
set
of
people
who
usher
in
the
New
Year
with
watching
and
fasting
,
as
if
they
were
bound
to
attend
as
chief
mourners
at
the
obsequies
of
the
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
we
can
not
but
think
it
a
great
deal
more
complimentary
,
both
to
the
old
year
that
has
rolled
away
,
and
to
the
New
Year
that
is
just
beginning
to
dawn
upon
us
,
to
see
the
old
fellow
out
,
and
the
new
one
in
,
with
gaiety
and
glee
.
   
<EOS>
There
must
have
been
some
few
occurrences
in
the
past
year
to
which
we
can
look
back
,
with
a
smile
of
cheerful
recollection
,
if
not
with
a
feeling
of
heartfelt
thankfulness
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
are
bound
by
every
rule
of
justice
and
equity
to
give
the
New
Year
credit
for
being
a
good
one
,
until
he
proves
himself
unworthy
the
confidence
we
repose
in
him
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
our
view
of
the
matter
;
and
entertaining
it
,
notwithstanding
our
respect
for
the
old
year
,
one
of
the
few
remaining
moments
of
whose
existence
passes
away
with
every
word
we
write
,
here
we
are
,
seated
by
our
fireside
on
this
last
night
of
the
old
year
,
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
-
six
,
penning
this
article
with
as
jovial
a
face
as
if
nothing
extraordinary
had
happened
,
or
was
about
to
happen
,
to
disturb
our
good
humour
.
   
<EOS>
Hackney
-
coaches
and
carriages
keep
rattling
up
the
street
and
down
the
street
in
rapid
succession
,
conveying
,
doubtless
,
smartly
-
dressed
coachfuls
to
crowded
parties
;
loud
and
repeated
double
knocks
at
the
house
with
green
blinds
,
opposite
,
announce
to
the
whole
neighbourhood
that
there
's
one
large
party
in
the
street
at
all
events
;
and
we
saw
through
the
window
,
and
through
the
fog
too
,
till
it
grew
so
thick
that
we
rung
for
candles
,
and
drew
our
curtains
,
pastry
-
cooks
'
men
with
green
boxes
on
their
heads
,
and
rout
-
furniture
-
warehouse
-
carts
,
with
cane
seats
and
French
lamps
,
hurrying
to
the
numerous
houses
where
an
annual
festival
is
held
in
honour
of
the
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
We
can
fancy
one
of
these
parties
,
we
think
,
as
well
as
if
we
were
duly
dress
-
coated
and
pumped
,
and
had
just
been
announced
at
the
drawing
-
room
door
.
   
<EOS>
Take
the
house
with
the
green
blinds
for
instance
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
it
is
a
quadrille
party
,
because
we
saw
some
men
taking
up
the
front
drawing
-
room
carpet
while
we
sat
at
breakfast
this
morning
,
and
if
further
evidence
be
required
,
and
we
must
tell
the
truth
,
we
just
now
saw
one
of
the
young
ladies
"
doing
"
another
of
the
young
ladies
'
hair
,
near
one
of
the
bedroom
windows
,
in
an
unusual
style
of
splendour
,
<EOS>
which
nothing
else
but
a
quadrille
party
could
possibly
justify
.
   
<EOS>
The
master
of
the
house
with
the
green
blinds
is
in
a
public
office
;
we
know
the
fact
by
the
cut
of
his
coat
,
the
tie
of
his
neckcloth
,
and
the
self
-
satisfaction
of
his
gait
---
the
very
green
blinds
themselves
have
a
Somerset
House
air
about
them
.
   
<EOS>
Hark
!
---
a
cab
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
junior
clerk
in
the
same
office
;
a
tidy
sort
of
young
man
,
with
a
tendency
to
cold
and
corns
,
who
comes
in
a
pair
of
boots
with
black
cloth
fronts
,
and
brings
his
shoes
in
his
coat
-
pocket
,
which
shoes
he
is
at
this
very
moment
putting
on
in
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
Now
he
is
announced
by
the
man
in
the
passage
to
another
man
in
a
blue
coat
,
who
is
a
disguised
messenger
from
the
office
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
on
the
first
landing
precedes
him
to
the
drawing
-
room
door
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Tupple
!
"
shouts
the
messenger
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
ARE
you
,
Tupple
?
"
says
the
master
of
the
house
,
advancing
from
the
fire
,
before
which
he
has
been
talking
politics
and
airing
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
this
is
Mr
Tupple
(
a
courteous
salute
from
the
lady
of
the
house
)
;
<EOS>
Tupple
,
my
eldest

;
Julia
,
my
dear
,
Mr
Tupple
;
Tupple
,
my
other
daughters
;
my
son
,
sir
;
"
Tupple
rubs
his
hands
very
hard
,
and
smiles
as
if
it
were
all
capital
fun
,
and
keeps
constantly
bowing
and
turning
himself
round
,
till
the
whole
family
have
been
introduced
,
when
he
glides
into
a
chair
at
the
corner
of
the
sofa
,
and
opens
a
miscellaneous
conversation
with
the
young
ladies
upon
the
weather
,
and
the
theatres
,
and
the
old
year
,
and
the
last
new
murder
,
and
the
balloon
,
and
the
ladies
'
sleeves
,
and
the
festivities
of
the
season
,
and
a
great
many
other
topics
of
small
talk
.
   
<EOS>
More
double
knocks
!
<EOS>
what
an
extensive
party
!
<EOS>
what
an
incessant
hum
of
conversation
and
general
sipping
of
coffee
!
 
<EOS>
We
see
Tupple
now
,
in
our
mind
's
eye
,
in
the
height
of
his
glory
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
just
handed
that
stout
old
lady
's
cup
to
the
servant
;
and
now
,
he
dives
among
the
crowd
of
young
men
by
the
door
,
to
intercept
the
other
servant
,
and
secure
the
muffin
-
plate
for
the
old
lady
's
daughter
,
before
he
leaves
the
room
;
and
now
,
as
he
passes
the
sofa
on
his
way
back
,
he
bestows
a
glance
of
recognition
and
patronage
upon
the
young
ladies
as
condescending
and
familiar
as
if
he
had
known
them
from
infancy
.
   
<EOS>
Charming
person
Mr
Tupple
---
perfect
ladies
'
man
---
 
such
a
delightful
companion

too

<EOS>
Laugh

<EOS>
---
nobody
ever
understood
papa
's
jokes
<EOS>
half
so
well
as
Mr
Tupple
,
who
laughs
himself
into
convulsions
at
every
fresh
burst
of
facetiousness
.
 
<EOS>
Most
delightful
partner

<EOS>
talks
through
the
whole
set
!
<EOS>
and
although
he
does
seem
at
first
rather
gay
and
frivolous
,
so
romantic
and
with
so
MUCH
feeling
!
 
<EOS>
Quite
a
love
.
 
<EOS>
No
great
favourite
with
the
young
men
<EOS>
,
certainly
,
who
sneer
at
,
and
affect
to
despise
him
;
but
everybody
knows
that
's
only
envy
,
and
they
need
n't
give
themselves
the
trouble
to
depreciate
his
merits
at
any
rate
,
for
Ma
says
he
shall
be
asked
to
every
future
dinner
-
party
,
if
it
's
only
to
talk
to
people
between
the
courses
,
and
distract
their
attention
when
there
's
any
unexpected
delay
in
the
kitchen
.
   
<EOS>
At
supper
,
Mr
Tupple
shows
to
still
greater
advantage
than
he
has
done
throughout
the
evening
,
and
when
Pa
requests
every
one
to
fill
their
glasses
for
the
purpose
of
drinking
happiness
throughout
the
year
,
Mr
Tupple
is
SO
droll
:
 
insisting
on
all
the
young
ladies
having
their
glasses
filled
,
notwithstanding
their
repeated
assurances
that
they
never
can
,
by
any
possibility
,
think
of
emptying
them
and
subsequently
begging
permission
to
say
a
few
words
on
the
sentiment
which
has
just
been
uttered
by
Pa
---
when
he
makes
one
of
the
most
brilliant
and
poetical
speeches
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
,
about
the
old
year
and
the
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
toast
has
been
drunk
,
and
when
the
ladies
have
retired
,
Mr
Tupple
requests
that
every
gentleman
will
do
him
the
favour
of
filling
his
glass
,
for
he
has
a
toast
to
propose
:
 
on
which
all
the
gentlemen
cry
"
Hear
!
<EOS>
hear
!
"
and
pass
the
decanters
accordingly
:
and
Mr
Tupple
being
informed
by
the
master
of
the
house
that
they
are
all
charged
,
and
waiting
for
his
toast
,
rises
,
and
begs
to
remind
the
gentlemen
present
,
how
much
they
have
been
delighted
by
the
dazzling
array
of
elegance
and
beauty
which
the
drawing
-
room
has
exhibited
that
night
,
and
how
their
senses
have
been
charmed
,
and
their
hearts
captivated
,
by
the
bewitching
concentration
of
female
loveliness
which
that
very
room
has
so
recently
displayed
.
<EOS>
(
Loud
cries
of
"
Hear
!
"
)
 
<EOS>
Much
as
he
(
Tupple
)
would
be
disposed
to
deplore
the
absence
of
the
ladies
,
on
other
grounds
,
he
can
not
but
derive
some
consolation
from
the
reflection
that
the
very
circumstance
of
their
not
being
present
,
enables
him
to
propose
a
toast
,
which
he
would
have
otherwise
been
prevented
from
giving
---
that
toast
he
begs
to
say
is
---
"
The
Ladies
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
Great
applause
.
)
<EOS>
The
Ladies
!
<EOS>
among
whom
the
fascinating
daughters
of
their
excellent
host
,
are
alike
conspicuous
for
their
beauty
,
their
accomplishments
,
and
their
elegance
.
 
<EOS>
He
begs
them
to
drain
a
bumper
to
"
The
Ladies
,
and
a
happy
new
year
to
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
Prolonged
approbation
;
above
which
the
noise
of
the
ladies
dancing
the
Spanish
dance
among
themselves
,
overhead
,
is
distinctly
audible
.
)
   
<EOS>
The
applause
consequent
on
this
toast
,
has
scarcely
subsided
,
when
a
young
gentleman
in
a
pink
under
-
waistcoat
,
sitting
towards
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
is
observed
to
grow
very
restless
and
fidgety
,
and
to
evince
strong
indications
of
some
latent
desire
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
in
a
speech
,
which
the
wary
Tupple
at
once
perceiving
,
determines
to
forestall
by
speaking
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
rises
again
,
with
an
air
of
solemn
importance
,
and
trusts
he
may
be
permitted
to
propose
another
toast
(
unqualified
approbation
,
and
Mr
Tupple
proceeds
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
sure
they
must
all
be
deeply
impressed
with
the
hospitality
<EOS>
---
he
may
say
the
splendour
---
with
which
they
have
been
that
night
received
by
their
worthy
host
and
hostess
.
 
<EOS>
(
Unbounded
applause
.
)
 
<EOS>
Although
this
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
he
has
had
the
pleasure
and
delight
of
sitting
at
that
board
,
he
has
known
his
friend
Dobble
long
and
intimately
;
he
has
been
connected
with
him
in
business
---
he
wishes
everybody
present
knew
Dobble
as
well
as
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
(
A
cough
from
the
host
.
)
<EOS>
He
(
Tupple
)
can
lay
his
hand
upon
his
(
Tupple
's
)
heart
,
and
declare
his
confident
belief
that
a
better
man
,
a
better
husband
,
a
better
father
,
a
better
brother
,
a
better
son
,
a
better
relation
in
any
relation
of
life
,
than
Dobble
,
never
existed
.
 
<EOS>
(
Loud
cries
of
"
Hear
!
"
)
 
<EOS>
They
have
seen
him
to
-
night
in
the
peaceful
bosom
of
his
family
;
they
should
see
him
in
the
morning
,
in
the
trying
duties
of
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
Calm
in
the
perusal
of
the
morning
papers
,
uncompromising
in
the
signature
of
his
name
,
dignified
in
his
replies
to
the
inquiries
of
stranger
applicants
,
deferential
in
his
behaviour
to
his
superiors
,
majestic
in
his
deportment
to
the
messengers
.
 
<EOS>
(
Cheers
.
)
 
<EOS>
When
he
bears
this
merited
testimony
to
the
excellent
qualities
of
his
friend
Dobble
,
what
can
he
say
in
approaching
such
a
subject
as
Mrs
Dobble
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
requisite
for
him
to
expatiate
on
the
qualities
of
that
amiable
woman
?
 
<EOS>
No
;
he
will
spare
his
friend
Dobble
's
feelings
;
he
will
spare
the
feelings
of
his
friend
---
if
he
will
allow
him
to
have
the
honour
of
calling
him
so
---
Mr
Dobble
,
junior
.
 
<EOS>
(
Here
Mr
Dobble
,
junior
,
who
has
been
previously
distending
his
mouth
to
a
considerable
width
,
by
thrusting
a
particularly
fine
orange
into
that
feature
,
suspends
operations
,
and
assumes
a
proper
appearance
of
intense
melancholy
)
.
<EOS>
He
will
simply
say
---
and
he
is
quite
certain
it
is
a
sentiment
in
which
all
who
hear
him
will
readily
concur
---
that
his
friend
Dobble
is
as
superior
to
any
man
he
ever
knew
,
as
Mrs
Dobble
is
far
beyond
any
woman
he
ever
saw
(
except
her
daughters
)
;
and
he
will
conclude
by
proposing
their
worthy
"
Host
and
Hostess
,
and
may
they
live
to
enjoy
many
more
new
years
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
toast
is
drunk
with
acclamation
;
Dobble
returns
thanks
,
and
the
whole
party
rejoin
the
ladies
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Young
men
who
were
too
bashful
to
dance
before
supper
,
find
tongues
and
partners
;
the
musicians
exhibit
unequivocal
symptoms
of
having
drunk
the
new
year
in
,
while
the
company
were
out
;
and
dancing
is
kept
up
,
until
far
in
the
first
morning
of
the
new
year
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
scarcely
written
the
last
word
of
the
previous
sentence
,
when
the
first
stroke
of
twelve
,
peals
from
the
neighbouring
churches
.
 
<EOS>
There
certainly
---
we
must
confess
it
now
---
is
something
awful
in
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
Strictly
speaking
,
it
may
not
be
more
impressive
now
,
than
at
any
other
time
;
for
the
hours
steal
as
swiftly
on
,
at
other
periods
,
and
their
flight
is
little
heeded
.
<EOS>
But
,
we
measure
man
's
life
by
years
,
and
it
is
a
solemn
knell
that
warns
us
we
have
passed
another
of
the
landmarks
which
stands
between
us
and
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Disguise
it
as
we
may
,
the
reflection
will
force
itself
on
our
minds
,
that
when
the
next
bell
announces
the
arrival
of
a
new
year
,
we
may
be
insensible
alike
of
the
timely
warning
we
have
so
often
neglected
,
and
of
all
the
warm
feelings
that
glow
within
us
now
.

Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
was
a
carpenter
,
a
journeyman
carpenter
of
small
dimensions
,
decidedly
below
the
middle
size
---
bordering
,
perhaps
,
upon
the
dwarfish
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
was
round
and
shining
,
and
his
hair
carefully
twisted
into
the
outer
corner
of
each
eye
,
till
it
formed
a
variety
of
that
description
of
semi
-
curls
,
usually
known
as
"
aggerawators
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
earnings
were
all
-
sufficient
for
his
wants
,
varying
from
eighteen
shillings
to
one
pound
five
,
weekly
---
his
manner
undeniable
---
his
sabbath
waistcoats
dazzling
.
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
,
with
these
qualifications
,
Samuel
Wilkins
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
sex
:
 
<EOS>
many
women
have
been
captivated
by
far
less
substantial
qualifications
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Samuel
was
proof
against
their
blandishments
,
until
at
length
his
eyes
rested
on
those
of
a
Being
for
whom
,
from
that
time
forth
,
he
felt
fate
had
destined
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
,
and
conquered
---
proposed
,
and
was
accepted
---
loved
,
and
was
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wilkins
"
kept
company
"
with
Jemima
Evans
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Evans
(
or
Ivins
,
to
adopt
the
pronunciation
most
in
vogue
with
her
circle
of
acquaintance
)
had
adopted
in
early
life
the
useful
pursuit
of
shoe
-
binding
,
to
which
she
had
afterwards
superadded
the
occupation
of
a
straw
-
bonnet
maker
.
 
<EOS>
Herself
,
her
maternal
parent
,
and
two
sisters
,
formed
an
harmonious
quartett
in
the
most
secluded
portion
of
Camden
-
town
;
and
here
it
was
that
Mr
Wilkins
presented
himself
,
one
Monday
afternoon
,
in
his
best
attire
,
with
his
face
more
shining
and
his
waistcoat
more
bright
than
either
had
ever
appeared
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
were
just
going
to
tea
,
and
were
SO
glad
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
a
little
feast
;
two
ounces
of
seven
-
and
-
sixpenny
green
,
and
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
the
best
fresh
;
and
Mr
Wilkins
had
brought
a
pint
of
shrimps
,
neatly
folded
up
in
a
clean
belcher
,
to
give
a
zest
to
the
meal
,
and
propitiate
Mrs
Ivins
.
 
<EOS>
Jemima
was
"
cleaning
herself
"
up
-
stairs
;
so
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
sat
down
and
talked
domestic
economy
with
Mrs
Ivins
,
whilst
the
two
youngest
Miss
Ivinses
poked
bits
of
lighted
brown
paper
between
the
bars
under
the
kettle
,
to
make
the
water
boil
for
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wos
a
thinking
,
"
said
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
,
during
a
pause
in
the
conversation
---
"
I
wos
a
thinking
of
taking
J'mima
to
the
Eagle
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
---
"
O
my
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Ivins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
<EOS>
how
nice
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
youngest
Miss
Ivins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
declare
!
<EOS>
"
added
the
youngest
Miss
Ivins
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
J'mima
to
put
on
her
white
muslin
,
Tilly
,
"
screamed
Mrs
Ivins
,
with
motherly
anxiety
;
and
down
came
J'mima
herself
soon
afterwards
in
a
white
muslin
gown
carefully
hooked
and
eyed
,
a
little
red
shawl
,
plentifully
pinned
,
a
white
straw
bonnet
trimmed
with
red
ribbons
,
a
small
necklace
,
a
large
pair
of
bracelets
,
Denmark
satin
shoes
,
and
open
-
worked
stockings
;
white
cotton
gloves
on
her
fingers
,
and
a
cambric
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
carefully
folded
up
,
in
her
hand
---
all
quite
genteel
and
ladylike
.
<EOS>
And
away
went
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
and
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
,
and
a
dress
-
cane
,
with
a
gilt
knob
at
the
top
,
to
the
admiration
and
envy
of
the
street
in
general
,
and
to
the
high
gratification
of
Mrs
Ivins
,
and
the
two
youngest
Miss
Ivinses
in
particular
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
no
sooner
turned
into
the
Pancras
-
road
,
than
who
should
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
stumble
upon
,
by
the
most
fortunate
accident
in
the
world
,
but
a
young
lady
as
she
knew
,
with
HER
young
man
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
it
is
so
strange
how
things
do
turn
out
sometimes
<EOS>
---
they
were
actually
going
to
the
Eagle
too
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
was
introduced
to
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
's
young
man
,
and
they
all
walked
on
together
,
talking
,
and
laughing
,
and
joking
away
like
anything
;
and
when
they
got
as
far
as
Pentonville
,
Miss
Ivins
's
friend
's
young
man
WOULD
have
the
ladies
go
into
the
Crown
,
to
taste
some
shrub
,
which
,
after
a
great
blushing
and
giggling
,
and
hiding
of
faces
in
elaborate
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
they
consented
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Having
tasted
it
once
,
they
were
easily
prevailed
upon
to
taste
it
again
;
and
they
sat
out
in
the
garden
tasting
shrub
,
and
looking
at
the
Busses
alternately
,
till
it
was
just
the
proper
time
to
go
to
the
Eagle
;
and
then
they
resumed
their
journey
,
and
walked
very
fast
,
for
fear
they
should
lose
the
beginning
of
the
concert
in
the
Rotunda
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
ev'nly
!
"
said
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
,
and
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
,
both
at
once
,
when
they
had
passed
the
gate
and
were
fairly
inside
the
gardens
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
walks
,
beautifully
gravelled
and
planted
---
and
the
refreshment
-
boxes
,
painted
and
ornamented
like
so
many
snuff
-
boxes
---
and
the
variegated
lamps
shedding
their
rich
light
upon
the
company
's
heads
---
and
the
place
for
dancing
ready
chalked
for
the
company
's
feet
---
and
a
Moorish
band
playing
at
one
end
of
the
gardens
---
and
an
opposition
military
band
playing
away
at
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
waiters
were
rushing
to
and
fro
with
glasses
of
negus
,
and
glasses
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
bottles
of
ale
,
and
bottles
of
stout
;
and
ginger
-
beer
was
going
off
in
one
place
,
and
practical
jokes
were
going
on
in
another
;
and
people
were
crowding
to
the
door
of
the
Rotunda
;
and
in
short
the
whole
scene
was
,
as
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
,
inspired
by
the
novelty
,
or
the
shrub
,
or
both
,
observed
---
"
one
of
dazzling
excitement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
concert
-
room
,
never
was
anything
half
<EOS>
so
splendid
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
orchestra
for
the
singers
,
all
paint
,
gilding
,
and
plate
-
glass
;
and
such
an
organ
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
's
young
man
whispered
it
had
cost
"
four
hundred
pound
,
"
which
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
said
was
"
not
dear
neither
;
"
an
opinion
in
which
the
ladies
perfectly
coincided
.
 
<EOS>
The
audience
were
seated
on
elevated
benches
round
the
room
,
and
crowded
into
every
part
of
it
;
and
everybody
was
eating
and
drinking
as
comfortably
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Just
before
the
concert
commenced
,
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
ordered
two
glasses
of
rum
-
and
-
water
"
warm
with
---
"
and
two
slices
of
lemon
,
for
himself
and
the
other
young
man
,
together
with
"
a
pint
o
'
sherry
wine
for
the
ladies
,
and
some
sweet
carraway
-
seed
biscuits
;
"
and
they
would
have
been
quite
comfortable
and
happy
,
only
a
strange
gentleman
with
large
whiskers
WOULD
stare
at
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
,
and
another
gentleman
in
a
plaid
waistcoat
WOULD
wink
at
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
;
on
which
Miss
Jemima
Ivins
's
friend
's
young
man
exhibited
symptoms
of
boiling
over
,
and
began
to
mutter
about
"
people
's
imperence
,
"
and
"
swells
out
o
'
luck
;
"
and
to
intimate
,
in
oblique
terms
,
a
vague
intention
of
knocking
somebody
's
head
off
;
which
he
was
only
prevented
from
announcing
more
emphatically
,
by
both
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
and
her
friend
threatening
to
faint
away
on
the
spot
if
he
said
another
word
.
   
<EOS>
The
concert
commenced
---
overture
on
the
organ
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
solemn
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
,
glancing
,
perhaps
unconsciously
,
at
the
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
,
who
had
been
muttering
apart
for
some
time
past
,
as
if
he
were
holding
a
confidential
conversation
with
the
gilt
knob
of
the
dress
-
cane
,
breathed
hard
-
breathing
vengeance
,
perhaps
,
---
but
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
soldier
tired
,
"
Miss
Somebody
in
white
satin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ancore
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ancore
!
"
shouted
the
gentleman
in
the
plaid
waistcoat
immediately
,
hammering
the
table
with
a
stout
-
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
's
young
man
eyed
the
man
behind
the
waistcoat
from
head
to
foot
,
and
cast
a
look
of
interrogative
contempt
towards
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
.
 
<EOS>
Comic
song
,
accompanied
on
the
organ
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
was
convulsed
with
laughter
---
so
was
the
man
with
the
whiskers
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
the
ladies
did
,
the
plaid
waistcoat
and
whiskers
did
,
by
way
of
expressing
unity
of
sentiment
and
congeniality
of
soul
;
and
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
,
and
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
,
grew
lively
and
talkative
,
as
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
,
and
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
's
young
man
,
grew
morose
and
surly
in
inverse
proportion
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
if
the
matter
had
ended
here
,
the
little
party
might
soon
have
recovered
their
former
equanimity
;
but
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
and
his
friend
began
to
throw
looks
of
defiance
upon
the
waistcoat
and
whiskers
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
waistcoat
and
whiskers
,
by
way
of
intimating
the
slight
degree
in
which
they
were
affected
by
the
looks
aforesaid
,
bestowed
glances
of
increased
admiration
upon
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
and
friend
.
 
<EOS>
The
concert
and
vaudeville
concluded
,
they
promenaded
the
gardens
.
 
<EOS>
The
waistcoat
and
whiskers
did
the
same
;
and
made
divers
remarks
complimentary
to
the
ankles
of
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
and
friend
,
in
an
audible
tone
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
not
satisfied
with
these
numerous
atrocities
,
they
actually
came
up
and
asked
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
,
and
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
,
to
dance
,
without
taking
no
more
notice
of
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
,
and
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
friend
's
young
man
,
than
if
they
was
nobody
!
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
,
scoundrel
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
,
grasping
the
gilt
-
knobbed
dress
-
cane
firmly
in
his
right
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
YOU
,
you
little
humbug
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
whiskers
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
insult
me
and
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
friend
's
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
and
your
friend
be
hanged
!
"
responded
the
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
that
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Samuel
Wilkins
.
 
<EOS>
The
ferrule
of
the
gilt
-
knobbed
dress
-
cane
was
visible
for
an
instant
,
and
then
the
light
of
the
variegated
lamps
shone
brightly
upon
it
as
it
whirled
into
the
air
,
cane
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
it
him
,
"
said
the
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Horficer
!
"
screamed
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
's
beau
,
and
the
friend
's
young
man
,
lay
gasping
on
the
gravel
,
and
the
waistcoat
and
whiskers
were
seen
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
J'mima
Ivins
and
friend
being
conscious
that
the
affray
was
in
no
slight
degree
attributable
to
themselves
,
of
course
went
into
hysterics
forthwith
;
declared
themselves
the
most
injured
of
women
;
exclaimed
,
in
incoherent
ravings
,
that
they
had
been
suspected
---
wrongfully
suspected
---
<EOS>
oh
!
that
they
should
ever
have
lived
to
see
the
day
---
and
so
forth
;
suffered
a
relapse
every
time
they
opened
their
eyes
and
saw
their
unfortunate
little
admirers
;
and
were
carried
to
their
respective
abodes
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
a
state
of
insensibility
,
compounded
of
shrub
,
sherry
,
and
excitement
.

The
parlour
orator
We
had
been
lounging
one
evening
,
down
Oxford
-
street
,
Holborn
,
Cheapside
,
Coleman
-
street
,
Finsbury
-
square
,
and
so
on
,
with
the
intention
of
returning
westward
,
by
Pentonville
and
the
New
-
road
,
when
we
began
to
feel
rather
thirsty
,
and
disposed
to
rest
for
five
or
ten
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
we
turned
back
towards
an
old
,
quiet
,
decent
public
-
house
,
which
we
remembered
to
have
passed
but
a
moment
before
(
it
was
not
far
from
the
City
-
road
)
,
for
the
purpose
of
solacing
ourself
with
a
glass
of
ale
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
none
of
your
stuccoed
,
French
-
polished
,
illuminated
palaces
,
but
a
modest
public
-
house
of
the
old
school
,
with
a
little
old
bar
,
and
a
little
old
landlord
,
who
,
with
a
wife
and
daughter
of
the
same
pattern
,
was
comfortably
seated
in
the
bar
aforesaid
---
a
snug
little
room
with
a
cheerful
fire
,
protected
by
a
large
screen
:
 
from
behind
which
the
young
lady
emerged
on
our
representing
our
inclination
for
a
glass
of
ale
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
walk
into
the
parlour
,
sir
?
"
said
the
young
lady
,
in
seductive
tones
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
walk
into
the
parlour
,
sir
,
"
said
the
little
old
landlord
,
throwing
his
chair
back
,
and
looking
round
one
side
of
the
screen
,
to
survey
our
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
much
better
step
into
the
parlour
,
sir
,
"
said
the
little
old
lady
,
popping
out
her
head
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
screen
.
   
<EOS>
We
cast
a
slight
glance
around
,
as
if
to
express
our
ignorance
of
the
locality
so
much
recommended
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
old
landlord
observed
it
;
bustled
out
of
the
small
door
of
the
small
bar
;
and
forthwith
ushered
us
into
the
parlour
itself
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
an
ancient
,
dark
-
looking
room
,
with
oaken
wainscoting
,
a
sanded
floor
,
and
a
high
mantel
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
The
walls
were
ornamented
with
three
or
four
old
coloured
prints
in
black
frames
,
each
print
representing
a
naval
engagement
,
with
a
couple
of
men
-
of
-
war
banging
away
at
each
other
most
vigorously
,
while
another
vessel
or
two
were
blowing
up
in
the
distance
,
and
the
foreground
presented
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
broken
masts
and
blue
legs
sticking
up
out
of
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
Depending
from
the
ceiling
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
were
a
gas
-
light
and
bell
-
pull
;
on
each
side
were
three
or
four
long
narrow
tables
,
behind
which
was
a
thickly
-
planted
row
of
those
slippery
,
shiny
-
looking
wooden
chairs
,
peculiar
to
hostelries
of
this
description
.
 
<EOS>
The
monotonous
appearance
of
the
sanded
boards
was
relieved
by
an
occasional
spittoon
;
and
a
triangular
pile
of
those
useful
articles
adorned
the
two
upper
corners
of
the
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
furthest
table
,
nearest
the
fire
,
with
his
face
towards
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
room
,
sat
a
stoutish
man
of
about
forty
,
whose
short
,
stiff
,
black
hair
curled
closely
round
a
broad
high
forehead
,
and
a
face
to
which
something
besides
water
and
exercise
had
communicated
a
rather
inflamed
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
smoking
a
cigar
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
,
and
had
that
confident
oracular
air
which
marked
him
as
the
leading
politician
,
general
authority
,
and
universal
anecdote
-
relater
,
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
evidently
just
delivered
himself
of
something
very
weighty
;
for
the
remainder
of
the
company
were
puffing
at
their
respective
pipes
and
cigars
in
a
kind
of
solemn
abstraction
,
as
if
quite
overwhelmed
with
the
magnitude
of
the
subject
recently
under
discussion
.
   
<EOS>
On
his
right
hand
sat
an
elderly
gentleman
with
a
white
head
,
and
broad
-
brimmed
brown
hat
;
on
his
left
,
a
sharp
-
nosed
,
light
-
haired
man
in
a
brown
surtout
reaching
nearly
to
his
heels
,
who
took
a
whiff
at
his
pipe
,
and
an
admiring
glance
at
the
red
-
faced
man
,
alternately
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
extraordinary
!
"
said
the
light
-
haired
man
after
a
pause
of
five
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
assent
ran
through
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
extraordinary
---
not
at
all
,
"
said
the
red
-
faced
man
,
awakening
suddenly
from
his
reverie
,
and
turning
upon
the
light
-
haired
man
,
the
moment
he
had
spoken
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
it
be
extraordinary
?
<EOS>
---
why
is
it
extraordinary
?
<EOS>
---
prove
it
to
be
extraordinary
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
you
come
to
that
---
"
said
the
light
-
haired
man
,
meekly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
to
that
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
man
with
the
red
face
;
"
but
we
MUST
come
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
We
stand
,
in
these
times
,
upon
a
calm
elevation
of
intellectual
attainment
,
and
not
in
the
dark
recess
of
mental
deprivation
.
 
<EOS>
Proof
,
is
what
I
require
---
proof
,
and
not
assertions
,
in
these
stirring
times
.
 
<EOS>
Every
gen'lem'n
that
knows
me
,
knows
what
was
the
nature
and
effect
of
my
observations
,
when
it
was
in
the
contemplation
of
the
Old
-
street
Suburban
Representative
Discovery
Society
,
to
recommend
a
candidate
for
that
place
in
Cornwall
there
---
I
forget
the
name
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Snobee
,
"
said
Mr
Wilson
,
"
is
a
fit
and
proper
person
to
represent
the
borough
in
Parliament
.
"
<EOS>
"
Prove
it
,
"
says
I.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
friend
to
Reform
,
"
says
Mr
Wilson
.
<EOS>
"
Prove
it
,
"
says
I.
 
<EOS>
"
The
abolitionist
of
the
national
debt
,
the
unflinching
opponent
of
pensions
,
the
uncompromising
advocate
of
the
negro
,
the
reducer
of
sinecures
and
the
duration
of
Parliaments
;
the
extender
of
nothing
but
the
suffrages
of
the
people
,
"
says
Mr
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Prove
it

says
I.
 
<EOS>
"
His
acts
prove
it

says
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Prove
THEM

says
I.
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
could
not
prove
them
,
"
said
the
red
-
faced
man
,
looking
round
triumphantly
;
"
and
the
borough
did
n't
have
him
;
and
if
you
carried
this
principle
to
the
full
extent
,
you
'd
have
no
debt
,
no
pensions
,
no
sinecures
,
no
negroes
,
no
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
standing
upon
an
elevation
of
intellectual
attainment
,
and
having
reached
the
summit
of
popular
prosperity
,
you
might
bid
defiance
to
the
nations
of
the
earth
,
and
erect
yourselves
in
the
proud
confidence
of
wisdom
and
superiority
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
my
argument
---
this
always
has
been
my
argument
---
and
if
I
was
a
Member
of
the
House
of
Commons
to
-
morrow
,
I
'd
make
'em
shake
in
their
shoes
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
red
-
faced
man
,
having
struck
the
table
very
hard
with
his
clenched
fist
,
to
add
weight
to
the
declaration
,
smoked
away
like
a
brewery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well

"
said
the
sharp
-
nosed
man
,
in
a
very
slow
and
soft
voice
,
addressing
the
company
in
general
,
"
I
always
do
say

that
of
all
the
gentlemen
I
have
the
pleasure

"

"
Improving

said
Mr

it

<EOS>
"
You
may
say
I
am
improving

my
conversation
being
as
my
friend
Mr
Ellis
here
describes
it

that
is
not
for
me
to
say
anything
about

<EOS>
You

gentlemen

are
the
best
judges
on

point

this
I
will
say
,
when
I
came
into

first
used
this
room

ten

I
do
n't

there
was
one

who
knew
he
was
a
slave

and
now
you
all
know
it
,

writhe
under
it

<EOS>
Inscribe
that
upon
my
tomb

I
am
satisfied

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
as
to
inscribing
it
on
your
tomb
,
"
said
a
little
greengrocer
with
a
chubby
face
,
"
of
course
you
can
have
anything
chalked
up

as
you
likes
to
pay

so
far

to
yourself

your

,
when
you
come

that
there
abuse

you
'd
better
keep
it

<EOS>

Werry
hard

ejaculated
the

getting
more
red
with
eloquence

contradiction

resigning
the
dearest
birthright
of
your
children

neglecting
the
sacred
call

appeals

sneered
the

<EOS>
bending
beneath

insolent

The

abruptly
broke
off
,
sneered
melo

dramatically
,

buried
his
countenance
and
his
indignation
together

in
a
quart
pot

<EOS>
"
Ah

said
a
stout

in
a
large

who
had
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
this
luminary
all
the
time
he
was
speaking

"
Ah

<EOS>
"
Of

said
divers

himself

the

way

advice

"
 
<EOS>
And
the
red
-
faced
man
,
gradually
bursting
into
a
radiating
sentence
,
in
which
such
adjectives
as
"
dastardly
,
"
"
oppressive
,
"
"
violent
,
"
and
"
sanguinary
,
"
formed
the
most
conspicuous
words
,
knocked
his
hat
indignantly
over
his
eyes
,
left
the
room
,
and
slammed
the
door
after
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wonderful
man
!
"
said
he
of
the
sharp
nose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Splendid
speaker
!
"
added
the
broker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Great
power
!
<EOS>
"
said
everybody
but
the
greengrocer
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
they
said
it
,
the
whole
party
shook
their
heads
mysteriously
,
and
one
by
one
retired
,
leaving
us
alone
in
the
old
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
If
we
had
followed
the
established
precedent
in
all
such
instances
,
we
should
have
fallen
into
a
fit
of
musing
,
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
The
ancient
appearance
of
the
room
---
the
old
panelling
of
the
wall
<EOS>
---
the
chimney
blackened
with
smoke
and
age
---
would
have
carried
us
back
a
hundred
years
at
least
,
and
we
should
have
gone
dreaming
on
,
until
the
pewter
-
pot
on
the
table
,
or
the
little
beer
-
chiller
on
the
fire
,
had
started
into
life
,
and
addressed
to
us
a
long
story
of
days
gone
by
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
we
were
not
in
a
romantic
humour
;
and
although
we
tried
very
hard
to
invest
the
furniture
with
vitality
,
it
remained
perfectly
unmoved
,
obstinate
,
and
sullen
.
 
<EOS>
Being
thus
reduced
to
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
musing
about
ordinary
matters
,
our
thoughts
reverted
to
the
red
-
faced
man
,
and
his
oratorical
display
.
   
<EOS>
A
numerous
race
are
these
red
-
faced
men
;
there
is
not
a
parlour
,
or
club
-
room
,
or
benefit
society
,
or
humble
party
of
any
kind
,
without
its
red
-
faced
man
.
 
<EOS>
Weak
-
pated
dolts
they
are
,
and
a
great
deal
of
mischief
they
do
to
their
cause
,
however
good
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
just
to
hold
a
pattern
one
up
,
to
know
the
others
by
,
we
took
his
likeness
at
once
,
and
put
him
in
here
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
is
the
reason
why
we
have
written
this
paper
.
   
<EOS>
The
hospital
patient
In
our
rambles
through
the
streets
of
London
<EOS>
after
evening
has
set
in
,
we
often
pause
beneath
the
windows
of
some
public
hospital
,
and
picture
to
ourself
the
gloomy
and
mournful
scenes
that
are
passing
within
.
 
<EOS>
The
sudden
moving
of
a
taper
as
its
feeble
ray
shoots
from
window
to
window
,
until
its
light
gradually
disappears
,
as
if
it
were
carried
farther
back
into
the
room
to
the
bedside
of
some
suffering
patient
,
is
enough
to
awaken
a
whole
crowd
of
reflections
;
the
mere
glimmering
of
the
low
-
burning
lamps
,
which
,
when
all
other
habitations
are
wrapped
in
darkness
and
slumber
,
denote
the
chamber
where
so
many
forms
are
writhing
with
pain
,
or
wasting
with
disease
,
is
sufficient
to
check
the
most
boisterous
merriment
.
   
<EOS>
Who
can
tell
the
anguish
of
those
weary
hours
,
when
the
only
sound
the
sick
man
hears
,
is
the
disjointed
wanderings
of
some
feverish
slumberer
near
him
,
the
low
moan
of
pain
,
or
perhaps
the
muttered
,
long
-
forgotten
prayer
of
a
dying
man
?
 
<EOS>
Who
,
but
they
who
have
felt
it
,
can
imagine
the
sense
of
loneliness
and
desolation
which
must
be
the
portion
of
those
who
in
the
hour
of
dangerous
illness
are
left
to
be
tended
by
strangers
;
for
what
hands
,
be
they
ever
so
gentle
,
can
wipe
the
clammy
brow
,
or
smooth
the
restless
bed
,
like
those
of
mother
,
wife
,
or
child
?
   
<EOS>
Impressed
with
these
thoughts
,
we
have
turned
away
,
through
the
nearly
-
deserted
streets
;
and
the
sight
of
the
few
miserable
creatures
still
hovering
about
them
,
has
not
tended
to
lessen
the
pain
which
such
meditations
awaken
.
 
<EOS>
The
hospital
is
a
refuge
and
resting
-
place
for
hundreds
,
who
but
for
such
institutions
must
die
in
the
streets
and
doorways
;
but
what
can
be
the
feelings
of
some
outcasts
when
they
are
stretched
on
the
bed
of
sickness
with
scarcely
a
hope
of
recovery
?
 
<EOS>
The
wretched
woman
who
lingers
about
the
pavement
,
hours
after
midnight
,
and
the
miserable
shadow
of
a
man
---
the
ghastly
remnant
that
want
and
drunkenness
have
left
---
which
crouches
beneath
a
window
-
ledge
,
to
sleep
where
there
is
some
shelter
from
the
rain
,
have
little
to
bind
them
to
life
,
but
what
have
they
to
look
back
upon
,
in
death
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
the
unwonted
comforts
of
a
roof
and
a
bed
,
to
them
,
when
the
recollections
of
a
whole
life
of
debasement
stalk
before
them
;
when
repentance
seems
a
mockery
,
and
sorrow
comes
too
late
?
   
<EOS>
About
a
twelvemonth
ago
,
as
we
were
strolling
through
Covent
-
garden
(
we
had
been
thinking
about
these
things
over
-
night
)
,
we
were
attracted
by
the
very
prepossessing
appearance
of
a
pickpocket
,
who
having
declined
to
take
the
trouble
of
walking
to
the
Police
-
office
,
on
the
ground
that
he
had
n't
the
slightest
wish
to
go
there
at
all
,
was
being
conveyed
thither
in
a
wheelbarrow
,
to
the
huge
delight
of
a
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
Somehow
,
we
never
can
resist
joining
a
crowd
,
so
we
turned
back
with
the
mob
,
and
entered
the
office
,
in
company
with
our
friend
the
pickpocket
,
a
couple
of
policemen
,
and
as
many
dirty
-
faced
spectators
as
could
squeeze
their
way
in
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
powerful
,
ill
-
looking
young
fellow
at
the
bar
,
who
was
undergoing
an
examination
,
on
the
very
common
charge
of
having
,
on
the
previous
night
,
ill
-
treated
a
woman
,
with
whom
he
lived
in
some
court
hard
by
.
 
<EOS>
Several
witnesses
bore
testimony
to
acts
of
the
grossest
brutality
;
and
a
certificate
was
read
from
the
house
-
surgeon
of
a
neighbouring
hospital
,
describing
the
nature
of
the
injuries
the
woman
had
received
,
and
intimating
that
her
recovery
was
extremely
doubtful
.
   
<EOS>
Some
question
appeared
to
have
been
raised
about
the
identity
of
the
prisoner
;
for
when
it
was
agreed
that
the
two
magistrates
should
visit
the
hospital
at
eight
o'clock
that
evening
,
to
take
her
deposition
,
it
was
settled
that
the
man
should
be
taken
there
also
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
pale
at
this
,
and
we
saw
him
clench
the
bar
very
hard
when
the
order
was
given
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
removed
directly
afterwards
,
and
he
spoke
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
We
felt
an
irrepressible
curiosity
to
witness
this
interview
,
although
it
is
hard
to
tell
why
,
at
this
instant
,
for
we
knew
it
must
be
a
painful
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
very
difficult
matter
for
us
to
gain
permission
,
and
we
obtained
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
prisoner
,
and
the
officer
who
had
him
in
custody
,
were
already
at
the
hospital
when
we
reached
it
,
and
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
magistrates
in
a
small
room
below
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
was
handcuffed
,
and
his
hat
was
pulled
forward
over
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
see
,
though
,
by
the
whiteness
of
his
countenance
,
and
the
constant
twitching
of
the
muscles
of
his
face
,
that
he
dreaded
what
was
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
interval
,
the
magistrates
and
clerk
were
bowed
in
by
the
house
-
surgeon
and
a
couple
of
young
men
who
smelt
very
strong
of
tobacco
-
smoke
---
they
were
introduced
as
"
dressers
"
---
and
after
one
magistrate
had
complained
bitterly
of
the
cold
,
and
the
other
of
the
absence
of
any
news
in
the
evening
paper
,
it
was
announced
that
the
patient
was
prepared
;
and
we
were
conducted
to
the
"
casualty
ward
"
in
which
she
was
lying
.
   
<EOS>
The
dim
light
which
burnt
in
the
spacious
room
,
increased
rather
than
diminished
the
ghastly
appearance
of
the
hapless
creatures
in
the
beds
,
which
were
ranged
in
two
long
rows
on
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
bed
,
lay
a
child
enveloped
in
bandages
,
with
its
body
half
-
consumed
by
fire
;
in
another
,
a
female
,
rendered
hideous
by
some
dreadful
accident
,
was
wildly
beating
her
clenched
fists
on
the
coverlet
,
in
pain
;
on
a
third
,
there
lay
stretched
a
young
girl
,
apparently
in
the
heavy
stupor
often
the
immediate
precursor
of
death
:
 
<EOS>
her
face
was
stained
with
blood
,
and
her
breast
and
arms
were
bound
up
in
folds
of
linen
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
of
the
beds
were
empty
,
and
their
recent
occupants
were
sitting
beside
them
,
but
with
faces
so
wan
,
and
eyes
so
bright
and
glassy
,
that
it
was
fearful
to
meet
their
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
On
every
face
was
stamped
the
expression
of
anguish
and
suffering
.
   
<EOS>
The
object
of
the
visit
was
lying
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
fine
young
woman
of
about
two
or
three
and
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
Her
long
black
hair
,
which
had
been
hastily
cut
from
near
the
wounds
on
her
head
,
streamed
over
the
pillow
in
jagged
and
matted
locks
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
bore
deep
marks
of
the
ill
-
usage
she
had
received
:
 
<EOS>
her
hand
was
pressed
upon
her
side
,
as
if
her
chief
pain
were
there
;
her
breathing
was
short
and
heavy
;
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
she
was
dying
fast
.
 
<EOS>
She
murmured
a
few
words
in
reply
to
the
magistrate
's
inquiry
whether
she
was
in
great
pain
;
and
,
having
been
raised
on
the
pillow
by
the
nurse
,
looked
vacantly
upon
the
strange
countenances
that
surrounded
her
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
magistrate
nodded
to
the
officer
,
to
bring
the
man
forward
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
and
stationed
him
at
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
looked
on
with
a
wild
and
troubled
expression
of
face
;
but
her
sight
was
dim
,
and
she
did
not
know
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
off
his
hat
,
"
said
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
The
officer
did
as
he
was
desired
,
and
the
man
's
features
were
disclosed
.
   
<EOS>
The
girl
started
up
,
with
an
energy
quite
preternatural
;
the
fire
gleamed
in
her
heavy
eyes
,
and
the
blood
rushed
to
her
pale
and
sunken
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
convulsive
effort
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
back
upon
her
pillow
,
and
covering
her
scarred
and
bruised
face
with
her
hands
,
burst
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
cast
an
anxious
look
towards
her
,
but
otherwise
appeared
wholly
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
brief
pause
the
nature
of
the
errand
was
explained
,
and
the
oath
tendered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
girl
,
raising
herself
once
more
,
and
folding
her
hands
together
;
"
no
,
gentlemen
,
for
God
's
sake
!
 
<EOS>
I
did
it
myself
---
it
was
nobody
's
fault
---
it
was
an
accident
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
hurt
me
;
he
would
n't
for
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
<EOS>
dear
Jack
,
you
know
you
would
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
sight
was
fast
failing
her
,
and
her
hand
groped
over
the
bedclothes
in
search
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Brute
as
the
man
was
,
he
was
not
prepared
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
his
face
from
the
bed
,
and
sobbed
.
<EOS>
The
girl
's
colour
changed
,
and
her
breathing
grew
more
difficult
.
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
dying
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
respect
the
feelings
which
prompt
you
to
this
,
"
said
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
first
,
"
but
let
me
warn
you
,
not
to
persist
in
what
you
know
to
be
untrue
,
until
it
is
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
save
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
murmured
the
girl
,
laying
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
"
they
shall
not
persuade
me
to
swear
your
life
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
do
it
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
hurt
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
grasped
his
arm
tightly
,
and
added
,
in
a
broken
whisper
,
"
I
hope
God
Almighty
will
forgive
me
all
the
wrong
I
have
done
,
and
the
life
I
have
led
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
Some
kind
gentleman
take
my
love
to
my
poor
old
father
.
<EOS>
Five
years
ago
,
he
said
he
wished
I
had
died
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
wish
I
had
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
nurse
bent
over
the
girl
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
then
drew
the
sheet
over
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
covered
a
corpse
.
   
<EOS>
The
misplaced
attachment
of
Mr
John
Dounce
<EOS>
If
we
had
to
make
a
classification
of
society
,
there
is
a
particular
kind
of
men
whom
we
should
immediately
set
down
under
the
head
of
"
Old
Boys
;
"
and
a
column
of
most
extensive
dimensions
the
old
boys
would
require
.
 
<EOS>
To
what
precise
causes
the
rapid
advance
of
old
-
boy
population
is
to
be
traced
,
we
are
unable
to
determine
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
interesting
and
curious
speculation
,
but
,
as
we
have
not
sufficient
space
to
devote
to
it
here
,
we
simply
state
the
fact
that
the
numbers
of
the
old
boys
have
been
gradually
augmenting
within
the
last
few
years
,
and
that
they
are
at
this
moment
alarmingly
on
the
increase
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
a
general
review
of
the
subject
,
and
without
considering
it
minutely
in
detail
,
we
should
be
disposed
to
subdivide
the
old
boys
into
two
distinct
classes
---
the
gay
old
boys
,
and
the

<EOS>
The
gay
old
boys
,
are
paunchy
old
men
in
the
disguise
of
young
ones
,
who
frequent
the
Quadrant
and
Regent
-
street
in
the
day
-
time
:
 
the
theatres
(
especially
theatres
under
lady
management
)
at
night
;
and
who
assume
all
the
foppishness
and
levity
of
boys
,
without
the
excuse
of
youth
or
inexperience
.
 
<EOS>
The
steady
old
boys
are
certain
stout
old
gentlemen
of
clean
appearance
,
who
are
always
to
be
seen
in
the
same
taverns
,
at
the
same
hours
every
evening
,
smoking
and
drinking
in
the
same
company
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
once
a
fine
collection
of
old
boys
to
be
seen
round
the
circular
table
at
Offley
's
every
night
,
between
the
hours
of
half
-
past
eight
and
half
-
past
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
lost
sight
of
them
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
,
and
may
be
still
,
for
aught
we
know
,
two
splendid
specimens
in
full
blossom
at
the
Rainbow
Tavern
in
Fleet
-
street
,
who
always
used
to
sit
in
the
box
nearest
the
fireplace
,
and
smoked
long
cherry
-
stick
pipes
which
went
under
the
table
,
with
the
bowls
resting
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Grand

the

and
the
other
opposite
---
puffing
and
drinking
away
in
great
state
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
knew
them
,
and
it
was
supposed
by
some
people
that
they
were
both
immortal
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
John
Dounce
was
an
old
boy
of
the
latter
class
(
we
do
n't
mean
immortal
,
but
steady
)
,
a
retired

a

He
was

with
a
broad

had
that
grave

kind
of

peculiar
to
old

There
were
Mr

the

,
and
Mr
Jennings
,
the
robe

maker
(
two
jolly
young
fellows

)
,
and
Jones
,
the
barrister

clerk
---
rum

that
Jones
---
capital
company
---
full
of

!
<EOS>

and
there
they
sat
every
night
till
just
ten
minutes
before
twelve
,
drinking
their
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
smoking
their
pipes
,
and
telling
stories
,
and
enjoying
themselves
with
a
kind
of
solemn
joviality
particularly
edifying
.
   
<EOS>
Sometimes
Jones
would
propose
a
half
-
price
visit
to
Drury
Lane
or
Covent
Garden
,
to
see
two
acts
of
a
five
-
act
play
,
and
a
new
farce
,
perhaps
,
or
a
ballet
,
on
which
occasions
the
whole
four
of
them
went
together
:
 
none
of
your
hurrying
and
nonsense
,
but
having
their
brandy
-
and
-
water
first
,
comfortably
,
and
ordering
a
steak
and
some
oysters
for
their
supper
against
they
came
back
,
and
then
walking
coolly
into
the
pit
,
when
the
"
rush
"
had
gone
in
,
as
all
sensible
people
do
,
and
did
when
Mr
Dounce
was
a
young
man
,
except
when
the
celebrated
Master
Betty
was
at
the
height
of
his
popularity
,
and
then
,
sir
,
---
then
---
Mr
Dounce
perfectly
well
remembered
getting
a
holiday
from
business
;
and
going
to
the
pit
doors
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
,
and
waiting
there
,
till
six
in
the
afternoon
,
with
some
sandwiches
in
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
and
some
wine
in
a
phial
;
and
fainting
after
all
,
with
the
heat
and
fatigue
,
before
the
play
began
;
in
which
situation
he
was
lifted
out
of
the
pit
,
into
one
of
the
dress
boxes
,
sir
,
by
five
of
the
finest
women
of
that
day
,
sir
,
who
compassionated
his
situation
and
administered
restoratives
,
and
sent
a
black
servant
,
six
foot
high
,
in
blue
and
silver
livery
,
next
morning
with
their
compliments
,
and
to
know
how
he
found
himself
,
sir
---
by
G-
!
 
<EOS>
Between
the
acts
Mr
Dounce
and
Mr
Harris
,
and
Mr
Jennings
,
used
to
stand
up
,
and
look
round
the
house
,
and
Jones
---
knowing
fellow
that
Jones
---
knew
everybody
---
pointed
out
the
fashionable
and
celebrated
Lady
So
-
and
-
So
in
the
boxes
,
at
the
mention
of
whose
name
Mr
Dounce
,
after
brushing
up
his
hair
,
and
adjusting
his
neckerchief
,
would
inspect
the
aforesaid
Lady
So
-
and
-
So
through
an
immense
glass
,
and
remark
,
either
,
that
she
was
a
"
fine
woman
---
very
fine
woman
,
indeed
,
"
or
that
"
there
might
be
a
little
more
of
her
,
eh
,
Jones
?
"
 
Just
as
the
case
might
happen
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
dancing
began
,
John
Dounce
and
the
other
old
boys
were
particularly
anxious
to
see
what
was
going
forward
on
the
stage
,
and
Jones
---
wicked
dog
that
Jones
---
whispered
little
critical
remarks
into
the
ears
of
John
Dounce
,
which
John
Dounce
retailed
to
Mr
Harris
and
Mr
Harris
to
Mr
Jennings
;
and
then
they
all
four
laughed
,
until
the
tears
ran
down
out
of
their
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
curtain
fell
,
they
walked
back
together
,
two
and
two
,
to
the
steaks
and
oysters
;
and
when
they
came
to
the
second
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
Jones
---
hoaxing
scamp
,
that
Jones
---
used
to
recount
how
he
had
observed
a
lady
in
white
feathers
,
in
one
of
the
pit
boxes
,
gazing
intently
on
Mr
Dounce
all
the
evening
,
and
how
he
had
caught
Mr
Dounce
,
whenever
he
thought
no
one
was
looking
at
him
,
bestowing
ardent
looks
of
intense
devotion
on
the
lady
in
return
;
on
which
Mr
Harris
and
Mr
Jennings
used
to
laugh
very
heartily
,
and
John
Dounce
more
heartily
than
either
of
them
,
acknowledging
,
however
,
that
the
time
HAD
been
when
he
MIGHT
have
done
such
things
;
upon
which
Mr
Jones
used
to
poke
him
in
the
ribs
,
and
tell
him
he
had
been
a
sad
dog
in
his
time
,
which
John
Dounce
with
chuckles
confessed
.
 
<EOS>
And
after
Mr
Harris
and
Mr
Jennings
had
preferred
their
claims
to
the
character
of
having
been
sad
dogs
too
,
they
separated
harmoniously
,
and
trotted
home
.
   
<EOS>
The
decrees
of
Fate
,
and
the
means
by
which
they
are
brought
about
,
are
mysterious
and
inscrutable
.
 
<EOS>
John
Dounce
had
led
this
life
for
twenty
years
and
upwards
,
without
wish
for
change
,
or
care
for
variety
,
when
his
whole
social
system
was
suddenly
upset
and
turned
completely
topsy
-
turvy
---
not
by
an
earthquake
,
or
some
other
dreadful
convulsion
of
nature
,
as
the
reader
would
be
inclined
to
suppose
,
but
by
the
simple
agency
of
an
oyster
;
and
thus
it
happened
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
John
Dounce
was
returning
one
night
from
the
Sir
Somebody
's
Head
,
to
his
residence
in
Cursitor
-
street
---
not
tipsy
,
but
rather
excited
,
for
it
was
Mr
Jennings
's
birthday
,
and
they
had
had
a
brace
of
partridges
for
supper
,
and
a
brace
of
extra
glasses
afterwards
,
and
Jones
had
been
more
than
ordinarily
amusing
---
when
his
eyes
rested
on
a
newly
-
opened
oyster
-
shop
,
on
a
magnificent
scale
,
with
natives
laid
,
one
deep
,
in
circular
marble
basins
in
the
windows
,
together
with
little
round
barrels
of
oysters
directed
to
Lords
and
Baronets
,
and
Colonels
and
Captains
,
in
every
part
of
the
habitable
globe
.
   
<EOS>
Behind
the
natives
were
the
barrels
,
and
behind
the
barrels
was
a
young
lady
of
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
all
in
blue
,
and
all
alone
---
splendid
creature
,
charming
face
and
lovely
figure
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
difficult
to
say
whether
Mr
John
Dounce
's
red
countenance
,
illuminated
as
it
was
by
the
flickering
gas
-
light
in
the
window
before
which
he
paused
,
excited
the
lady
's
risibility
,
or
whether
a
natural
exuberance
of
animal
spirits
proved
too
much
for
that
staidness
of
demeanour
which
the
forms
of
society
rather
dictatorially
prescribe
.
 
<EOS>
But
certain
it
is
,
that
the
lady
smiled
;
then
put
her
finger
upon
her
lip
,
with
a
striking
recollection
of
what
was
due
to
herself
;
and
finally
retired
,
in
oyster
-
like
bashfulness
,
to
the
very
back
of
the
counter
.
 
<EOS>
The
sad
-
dog
sort
of
feeling
came
strongly
upon
John
Dounce
:
 
<EOS>
he
lingered
---
<EOS>
the
lady
in
blue
made
no
sign
.
 
<EOS>
He
coughed
---
still
she
came
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
entered
the
shop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
open
me
an
oyster
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Mr
John
Dounce
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dare
say
I
can
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
lady
in
blue
,
with
playfulness
.
<EOS>
And
Mr
John
Dounce
eat
one
oyster
,
and
then
looked
at
the
young
lady
,
and
then
eat
another
,
and
then
squeezed
the
young
lady
's
hand
as
she
was
opening
the
third
,
and
so
forth
,
until
he
had
devoured
a
dozen
of
those
at
eightpence
in
less
than
no
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
open
me
half
-
a
-
dozen
more
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
John
Dounce
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
what
I
can
do
for
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
young
lady
in
blue
,
even
more
bewitchingly
than
before
;
and
Mr
John
Dounce
eat
half
-
a
-
dozen
more
of
those
at
eightpence
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
manage
to
get
me
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Mr
John
Dounce
,
when
he
had
finished
the
oysters
:
 
in
a
tone
which
clearly
implied
his
supposition
that
she
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
,
sir
,
"
said
the
young
lady
:
 
<EOS>
and
away
she
ran
out
of
the
shop
,
and
down
the
street
,
her
long
auburn
ringlets
shaking
in
the
wind
in
the
most
enchanting
manner
;
and
back
she
came
again
,
tripping
over
the
coal
-
cellar
lids
like
a
whipping
-
top
,
with
a
tumbler
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
which
Mr
John
Dounce
insisted
on
her
taking
a
share
of
,
as
it
was
regular
ladies
'
grog
---
hot
,
strong
,
sweet
,
and
plenty
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
So
,
the
young
lady
sat
down
with
Mr
John
Dounce
,
in
a
little
red
box
with
a
green
curtain
,
and
took
a
small
sip
of
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
a
small
look
at
Mr
John
Dounce
,
and
then
turned
her
head
away
,
and
went
through
various
other
serio
-
pantomimic
fascinations
,
which
forcibly
reminded
Mr
John
Dounce
of
the
first
time
he
courted
his
first
wife
,
and
which
made
him
feel
more
affectionate
than
ever
;
in
pursuance
of
which
affection
,
and
actuated
by
which
feeling
,
Mr
John
Dounce
sounded
the
young
lady
on
her
matrimonial
engagements
,
when
the
young
lady
denied
having
formed
any
such
engagements
at
all
<EOS>
---
she
could
n't
abear
the
men
,
they
were
such
deceivers
;
thereupon
Mr
John
Dounce
inquired
whether
this
sweeping
condemnation
was
meant
to
include
other
than
very
young
men
;
on
which
the
young
lady
blushed
deeply
---
at
least
she
turned
away
her
head
,
and
said
Mr
John
Dounce
had
made
her
blush
,
so
of
course
she
DID
blush
---
and
<EOS>
Mr
John
Dounce
was
a
long
time
drinking
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
;
and
,
at
last
,
John
Dounce
went
home
to
bed
,
and
dreamed
of
his
first
wife
,
and
his
second
wife
,
and
the
young
lady
,
and
partridges
,
and
oysters
,
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
disinterested
attachments
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
John
Dounce
was
rather
feverish
with
the
extra
brandy
-
and
-
water
of
the
previous
night
;
and
,
partly
in
the
hope
of
cooling
himself
with
an
oyster
,
and
partly
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
whether
he
owed
the
young
lady
anything
,
or
not
,
went
back
to
the
oyster
-
shop
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
young
lady
had
appeared
beautiful
by
night
,
she
was
perfectly
irresistible
by
day
;
and
,
from
this
time
forward
,
a
change
came
over
the
spirit
of
John
Dounce
's
dream
.
<EOS>
He
bought
shirt
-
pins
;
wore
a
ring
on
his
third
finger
;
read
poetry
;
bribed
a
cheap
miniature
-
painter
to
perpetrate
a
faint
resemblance
to
a
youthful
face
,
with
a
curtain
over
his
head
,
six
large
books
in
the
background
,
and
an
open
country
in
the
distance
<EOS>
(
this
he
called
his
portrait
)
;
"
went
on
"
altogether
in
such
an
uproarious
manner
,
that
the
three
Miss
Dounces
went
off
on
small
pensions
,
he
having
made
the
tenement
in
Cursitor
-
street
too
warm
to
contain
them
;
and
in
short
,
comported
and
demeaned
himself
in
every
respect
like
an
unmitigated
old
Saracen
,
as
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
his
ancient
friends
,
the
other
old
boys
,
at
the
Sir
Somebody
's
Head
,
he
dropped
off
from
them
by
gradual
degrees
;
for
,
even
when
he
did
go
there
,
Jones
---
vulgar
fellow
that
Jones
---
persisted
in
asking
"
when
it
was
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
and
"
whether
he
was
to
have
any
gloves
?
<EOS>
"
together
with
other
inquiries
of
an
equally
offensive
nature
:
 
<EOS>
at
which
not
only
Harris
laughed
,
but
Jennings
also
;
so
,
he
cut
the
two
,
altogether
,
and
attached
himself
solely
to
the
blue
young
lady
at
the
smart
oyster
-
shop
.
   
<EOS>
Now
comes
the
moral
of
the
story
---
for
it
has
a
moral
after
all
.
<EOS>
The
last
-
mentioned
young
lady
,
having
derived
sufficient
profit
and
emolument
from
John
Dounce
's
attachment
,
not
only
refused
,
when
matters
came
to
a
crisis
,
to
take
him

A
tale
of
ambition
Miss
Amelia
Martin
was
pale
,
tallish
,
thin
,
and
two
-
and
-
thirty
---
what
ill
-
natured
people
would
call
plain
,
and
police
reports
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
milliner
and
dressmaker
,
living
on
her
business
and
not
above
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
a
young
lady
in
service
,
and
had
wanted
Miss
Martin
,
as
a
great
many
young
ladies
in
service
did
,
you
would
just
have
stepped
up
,
in
the
evening
,
to
number
forty
-
seven
,
Drummond
-
street
,
George
-
street
,
Euston
-
square
,
and
after
casting
your
eye
on
a
brass
door
-
plate
,
one
foot
ten
by
one
and
a
half
,
ornamented
with
a
great
brass
knob
at
each
of
the
four
corners
,
and
bearing
the
inscription
"
Miss
Martin
;
millinery
and
dressmaking
,
in
all
its
branches
;
"
you
'd
just
have
knocked
two
loud
knocks
at
the
street
-
door
;
and
down
would
have
come
Miss
Martin
herself
,
in
a
merino
gown
of
the
newest
fashion
,
black
velvet
bracelets
on
the
genteelest
principle
,
and
other
little
elegancies
of
the
most
approved
description
.
   
<EOS>
If
Miss
Martin
knew
the
young
lady
who
called
,
or
if
the
young
lady
who
called
had
been
recommended
by
any
other
young
lady
whom
Miss
Martin
knew
,
Miss
Martin
would
forthwith
show
her
up
-
stairs
into
the
two
-
pair
front
,
and
chat
she
would
---
<EOS>
SO
kind
,
and
SO
comfortable
<EOS>
---
it
really
was
n't
like
a
matter
of
business
,
she
was
so
friendly
;
and
,
then
Miss
Martin
,
after
contemplating
the
figure
and
general
appearance
of
the
young
lady
in
service
with
great
apparent
admiration
,
would
say
how
well
she
would
look
,
to
be
sure
,
in
a
low
dress
with
short
sleeves
;
made
very
full
in
the
skirts
,
with
four
tucks
in
the
bottom
;
to
which
the
young
lady
in
service
would
reply
in
terms
expressive
of
her
entire
concurrence
in
the
notion
,
and
of
the
virtuous
indignation
with
which
she
reflected
on
the
tyranny
of
"
Missis
,
"
who
would
n't
allow
a
young
girl
to
wear
a
short
sleeve
of
an
arternoon
---
no
,
nor
nothing
smart
,
not
even
a
pair
of
ear
-
rings
;
let
alone
hiding
people
's
heads
of
hair
under
them
frightful
caps
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
termination
of
this
complaint
,
Miss
Amelia
Martin
would
distantly
suggest
certain
dark
suspicions
that
some
people
were
jealous
on
account
of
their
own
daughters
,
and
were
obliged
to
keep
their
servants
'
charms
under
,
for
fear
they
should
get
married
first
,
which
was
no
uncommon
circumstance
---
leastways
she
had
known
two
or
three
young
ladies
in
service
,
who
had
married
a
great
deal
better
than
their
missises
,
and
THEY
were
not
very
good
-
looking
either
;
and
then
the
young
lady
would
inform
Miss
Martin
,
in
confidence
,
that
how
one
of
their
young
ladies
was
engaged
to
a
young
man
and
was
a
-
going
to
be
married
,
and
Missis
was
so
proud
about
it
<EOS>
there
was
no
bearing
of
her
;
but
how
she
need
n't
hold
her
head
quite
so
high
neither
,
for
,
after
all
,
he
was
only
a
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
after
expressing
due
contempt
for
clerks
in
general
,
and
the
engaged
clerk
in
particular
,
and
the
highest
opinion
possible
of
themselves
and
each
other
,
Miss
Martin
and
the
young
lady
in
service
would
bid
each
other
good
night
,
in
a
friendly
but
perfectly
genteel
manner
:
 
and
the
one
went
back
to
her
"
place
,
"
and
the
other
,
to
her
room
on
the
second
-
floor
front
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
saying
how
long
Miss
Amelia
Martin
might
have
continued
this
course
of
life
;
how
extensive
a
connection
she
might
have
established
among
young
ladies
in
service
;
or
what
amount
her
demands
upon
their
quarterly
receipts
might
have
ultimately
attained
,
had
not
an
unforeseen
train
of
circumstances
directed
her
thoughts
to
a
sphere
of
action
very
different
from
dressmaking
or
millinery
.
   
<EOS>
A
friend
of
Miss
Martin
's
who
had
long
been
keeping
company
with
an
ornamental
painter
and
decorator
's
journeyman
,
at
last
consented
(
on
being
at
last
asked
to
do
so
)
to
name
the
day
which
would
make
the
aforesaid
journeyman
a
happy
husband
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
Monday
that
was
appointed
for
the
celebration
of
the
nuptials
,
and
Miss
Amelia
Martin
was
invited
,
among
others
,
to
honour
the
wedding
-
dinner
with
her
presence
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
charming
party
;
Somers
-
town
the
locality
,
and
a
front
parlour
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
The
ornamental
painter
and
decorator
's
journeyman
had
taken
a
house
---
no
lodgings
nor
vulgarity
of
that
kind
,
but
a
house
---
four
beautiful
rooms
,
and
a
delightful
little
washhouse
at
the
end
of
the
passage
---
which
was
the
most
convenient
thing
in
the
world
,
for
the
bridesmaids
could
sit
in
the
front
parlour
and
receive
the
company
,
and
then
run
into
the
little
washhouse
and
see
how
the
pudding
and
boiled
pork
were
getting
on
in
the
copper
,
and
then
pop
back
into
the
parlour
again
,
as
snug
and
comfortable
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
And
such
a
parlour
as
it
was
!
<EOS>
Beautiful
Kidderminster
carpet
---
six
bran
-
new
cane
-
bottomed
stained
chairs
---
three
wine
-
glasses
and
a
tumbler
on
each
sideboard
---
farmer
's
girl
and
farmer
's
boy
on
the
mantelpiece
:
 
girl
tumbling
over
a
stile
,
and
boy
spitting
himself
,
on
the
handle
of
a
pitchfork
---
long
white
dimity
curtains
in
the
window
---
and
,
in
short
,
everything
on
the
most
genteel
scale
imaginable
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
the
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
baked
leg
of
mutton
at
the
top
,
boiled
leg
of
mutton
at
the
bottom
,
pair
of
fowls
and
leg
of
pork
in
the
middle
;
porter
-
pots
at
the
corners
;
pepper
,
mustard
,
and
vinegar
in
the
centre
;
vegetables
on
the
floor
;
and
plum
-
pudding
and
apple
-
pie
and
tartlets
without
number
:
 
to
say
nothing
of
cheese
,
and
celery
,
and
water
-
cresses
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
Company
!
<EOS>
Miss
Amelia
Martin
herself
declared
,
on
a
subsequent
occasion
,
that
,
much
as
she
had
heard
of
the
ornamental
painter
's
journeyman
's
connexion
,
she
never
could
have
supposed
it
was
half
so
genteel
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
his
father
,
such
a
funny
old
gentleman
---
and
his
mother
,
such
a
dear
old
lady
---
and
his
sister
,
such
a
charming
girl
---
and
his
brother
,
such
a
manly
-
looking
young
man
---
with
such
a
eye
!
 
<EOS>
But
even
all
these
were
as
nothing
when
compared
with
his
musical
friends
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
,
from
White
Conduit
,
with
whom
the
ornamental
painter
's
journeyman
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
contract
an
intimacy
while
engaged
in
decorating
the
concert
-
room
of
that
noble
institution
.
 
<EOS>
To
hear
them
sing
separately
,
was
divine
,
but
when
they
went
through
the
tragic
duet
of
"
Red
Ruffian
,
retire
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
it
was
,
as
Miss
Martin
afterwards
remarked
,
"
thrilling
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
why
(
as
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
observed
)
<EOS>
why
were
they
not
engaged
at
one
of
the
patent
theatres
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
was
to
be
told
that
their
voices
were
not
powerful
enough
to
fill
the
House
,
his
only
reply
was
,
that
he
would
back
himself
for
any
amount
to
fill
Russell
-
square
---
a
statement
in
which
the
company
,
after
hearing
the
duet
,
expressed
their
full
belief
;
so
they
all
said
it
was
shameful
treatment
;
and
both
Mr
and
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
said
it
was
shameful
too
;
and
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
looked
very
serious
,
and
said
he
knew
who
his
malignant
opponents
were
,
but
they
had
better
take
care
how
far
they
went
,
for
if
they
irritated
him
too
much
he
had
not
quite
made
up
his
mind
whether
he
would
n't
bring
the
subject
before
Parliament
;
and
they
all
agreed
that
it
"
'
ud
serve
'em
quite
right
,
and
it
was
very
proper
that
such
people
should
be
made
an
example
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
said
he
'd
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
conversation
resumed
its
former
tone
,
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
claimed
his
right
to
call
upon
a
lady
,
and
the
right
being
conceded
,
trusted
Miss
Martin
would
favour
the
company
---
a
proposal
which
met
with
unanimous
approbation
,
whereupon
Miss
Martin
,
after
sundry
hesitatings
and
coughings
,
with
a
preparatory
choke
or
two
,
and
an
introductory
declaration
that
she
was
frightened
to
death
to
attempt
it
before
such
great
judges
of
the
art
,
commenced
a
species
of
treble
chirruping
containing
frequent
allusions
to
some
young
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Hen
-
e
-
ry
,
with
an
occasional
reference
to
madness
and
broken
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
frequently
interrupted
the
progress
of
the
song
,
by
ejaculating
"
Beautiful
!
"
---
"
Charming
!
"
---
<EOS>
"
Brilliant
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
Oh
!
splendid
,
"
&
c
;
and
at
its
close
the
admiration
of
himself
,
and
his
lady
,
knew
no
bounds
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
hear
so
sweet
a
voice
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
of
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
;
indeed
I
never
did
,
love
,
"
replied
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
Miss
Martin
,
with
a
little
cultivation
,
would
be
very
like
Signora
Marra
Boni
,
my
dear
?
"
asked
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
exactly
the
very
thing
that
struck
me
,
my
love
,
"
answered
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
.
   
<EOS>
And
thus
the
time
passed
away
;
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
played
tunes
on
a
walking
-
stick
,
and
then
went
behind
the
parlour
-
door
and
gave
his
celebrated
imitations
of
actors
,
edge
-
tools
,
and
animals
;
Miss
Martin
sang
several
other
songs
with
increased
admiration
every
time
;
and
even
the
funny
old
gentleman
began
singing
.
 
<EOS>
His
song
had
properly
seven
verses
,
but
as
he
could
n't
recollect
more
than
the
first
one
,
he
sang
that
over
seven
times
,
apparently
very
much
to
his
own
personal
gratification
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
all
the
company
sang
the
national
anthem
with
national
independence
---
each
for
himself
,
without
reference
to
the
other
---
and
finally
separated
:
 
<EOS>
all
declaring
that
they
never
had
spent
so
pleasant
an
evening
:
 
and
Miss
Martin
inwardly
resolving
to
adopt
the
advice
of
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
,
and
to
"
come
out
"
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
"
coming
out
,
"
either
in
acting
,
or
singing
,
or
society
,
or
facetiousness
,
or
anything
else
,
is
all
very
well
,
and
remarkably
pleasant
to
the
individual
principally
concerned
,
if
he
or
she
can
but
manage
to
come
out
with
a
burst
,
and
being
out
,
to
keep
out
,
and
not
go
in
again
;
but
,
it
does
unfortunately
happen
that
both
consummations
are
extremely
difficult
to
accomplish
,
and
that
the
difficulties
,
of
getting
out
at
all
in
the
first
instance
,
and
if
you
surmount
them
,
of
keeping
out
in
the
second
,
are
pretty
much
on
a
par
,
and
no
slight
ones
either
---
and
so
Miss
Amelia
Martin
shortly
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
singular
fact
(
there
being
ladies
in
the
case
)
that
Miss
Amelia
Martin
's
principal
foible
was
vanity
,
and
the
leading
characteristic
of
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
an
attachment
to
dress
.
 
<EOS>
Dismal
wailings
were
heard
to
issue
from
the
second
-
floor
front
of
number
forty
-
seven
,
Drummond
-
street
,
George
-
street
,
Euston
-
square
;
it
was
Miss
Martin
practising
.
 
<EOS>
Half
-
suppressed
murmurs
disturbed
the
calm
dignity
of
the
White
Conduit
orchestra
at
the
commencement
of
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
appearance
of
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
in
full
dress
,
that
occasioned
them
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Martin
studied
incessantly
---
the
practising
was
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
taught
gratuitously
now
<EOS>
and
then
---
the
dresses
were
the
result
.
   
<EOS>
Weeks
passed
away
;
the
White
Conduit
season
had
begun
,
and
progressed
,
and
was
more
than
half
over
.
 
<EOS>
The
dressmaking
business
had
fallen
off
,
from
neglect
;
and
its
profits
had
dwindled
away
almost
imperceptibly
.
 
<EOS>
A
benefit
-
night
approached
;
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
yielded
to
the
earnest
solicitations
of
Miss
Amelia
Martin
,
and
introduced
her
personally
to
the
"
comic
gentleman
"
whose
benefit
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
comic
gentleman
was
all
smiles
and
blandness
---
he
had
composed
a
duet
,
expressly
for
the
occasion
,
and
Miss
Martin
should
sing
it
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
arrived
;
there
was
an
immense
room
---
ninety

seven
sixpenn'orths
of
gin

thirty

two

and
the
ornamental

with
his
wife
and
a
select
circle
of
acquaintance

were
seated
at
one
of

cried
the

The

by

It

<EOS>
Miss
Amelia

left
the
orchestra

with
much
less
ceremony
than
she
had
entered
it
;
and
,
as
she
could
n't
sing
out
,
never
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
good
humour
was
not
restored
until
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
had
become
purple
in
the
face
,
by
imitating
divers
quadrupeds
for
half
an
hour
,
without
being
able
to
render
himself
audible
;
and
,
to
this
day
,
neither
has
Miss
Amelia
Martin
's
good
humour
been
restored
,
nor
the
dresses
made
for
and
presented
to
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
,
nor
the
local
abilities
which
Mr

once
staked
his

that

The
dancing
academy
Of
all
the
dancing
academies
that
ever
were
established
,
there
never
was
one
more
popular
in
its
immediate
vicinity
than
Signor
Billsmethi
's
,
of
the
"
King
's
Theatre
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
Spring
-
gardens
,
or
Newman
-
street
,
or
Berners
-
street
,
or
Gower
-
street
,
or
Charlotte
-
street
,
or
Percy

street
,
or
any
other
of
the
numerous
streets
which
have
been
devoted
time
out
of
mind
to
professional
people
,
dispensaries
,
and
boarding
-
houses
;
it
was
not
in
the
West
-
end
at
all
---
it
rather
approximated
to
the
eastern
portion
of
London
,
being
situated
in
the
populous
and
improving
neighbourhood
of
Gray's
-
inn
-
lane
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
dear
dancing
academy
---
<EOS>
four
-
and
-
sixpence
a
quarter
is
decidedly
cheap
upon
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
VERY
select
,
the
number
of
pupils
being
strictly
limited
to
seventy
-
five
,
and
a
quarter
's
payment
in
advance
being
rigidly
exacted
.
<EOS>
There
was
public
tuition
and
private
tuition
---
an
assembly
-
room
and
a
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Signor
Billsmethi
's
family
were
always
thrown
in
with
the
parlour
,
and
included
in
parlour
price
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
private
pupil
had
Signor
Billsmethi
's
parlour
to
dance
IN
,
and
Signor
Billsmethi
's
family
to
dance
WITH
;
and
when
he
had
been
sufficiently
broken
in
in
the
parlour
,
he
began
to
run
in
couples
in
the
assembly
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
dancing
academy
of
Signor
Billsmethi
,
when
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
,
of
Fetter
-
lane
,
first
saw
an
unstamped
advertisement
walking
leisurely
down
Holborn
-
hill
,
announcing
to
the
world
that
Signor
Billsmethi
,
of
the
King
's
Theatre
,
intended
opening
for
the
season
with
a
Grand
Ball
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
was
in
the
oil
and
colour
line
---
just
of
age
,
with
a
little
money
,
a
little
business
,
and
a
little
mother
,
who
,
having
managed
her
husband
and
HIS
business
in
his
lifetime
,
took
to
managing
her
son
and
HIS
business
after
his
decease
;
and
so
,
somehow
or
other
,
he
had
been
cooped
up
in
the
little
back
parlour
behind
the
shop
on
week
-
days
,
and
in
a
little
deal
box
without
a
lid
(
called
by
courtesy
a
pew
)
at
Bethel
Chapel
,
on
Sundays
,
and
had
seen
no
more
of
the
world
than
if
he
had
been
an
infant
all
his
days
;
whereas
Young
White
,
at
the
gas
-
fitter
's
over
the
way
,
three
years
younger
than
him
,
had
been
flaring
away
like
winkin
'
---
going
to
the
theatre
---
supping
at
harmonic
meetings
---
<EOS>
eating
oysters
by
the
barrel
---
drinking
stout
by
the
gallon
---
even
out
all
night
,
and
coming
home
as
cool
in
the
morning
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
stand
it
any
longer
,
and
had
that
very
morning
expressed
to
his
mother
a
firm
determination
to
be
"
blowed
,
"
in
the
event
of
his
not
being
instantly
provided
with
a
street
-
door
key
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
walking
down
Holborn
-
hill
,
thinking
about
all
these
things
,
and
wondering
how
he
could
manage
to
get
introduced
into
genteel
society
for
the
first
time
,
when
his
eyes
rested
on
Signor
Billsmethi
's
announcement
,
which
it
immediately
struck
him
<EOS>
was
just
the
very
thing
he
wanted
;
for
he
should
not
only
be
able
to
select
a
genteel
circle
of
acquaintance
at
once
,
out
of
the
five
-
and
-
seventy
pupils
at
four
-
and
-
sixpence
a
quarter
,
but
should
qualify
himself
at
the
same
time
to
go
through
a
hornpipe
in
private
society
,
with
perfect
ease
to
himself
and
great
delight
to
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
stopped
the
unstamped
advertisement
---
an
animated
sandwich
,
composed
of
a
boy
between
two
boards
---
and
having
procured
a
very
small
card
with
the
Signor
's
address
indented
thereon
,
walked
straight
at
once
to
the
Signor
's
house
---
and
very
fast
he
walked
too
,
for
fear
<EOS>
the
list
should
be
filled
up
,
and
the
five
-
and
-
seventy
completed
,
before
he
got
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
Signor
was
at
home
,
and
,
what
was
still
more
gratifying
,
he
was
an
Englishman
!
<EOS>
Such
a
nice
man
---
and
so
polite
!
 
<EOS>
The
list
was
not
full
,
but
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
that
there
was
only
just
one
vacancy
,
and
even
that
one
would
have
been
filled
up
,
that
very
morning
,
only
Signor
Billsmethi
was
dissatisfied
with
the
reference
,
and
,
being
very
much
afraid
that
the
lady
was
n't
select
,
would
n't
take
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
very
much
delighted
I
am
<EOS>
,
Mr
Cooper
,
"
said
Signor
Billsmethi
,
"
that
I
did
NOT
take
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Mr
Cooper
---
I
do
n't
say
it
to
flatter
you
,
for
<EOS>
I
know
you
're
above
it
<EOS>
---
that
I
consider
myself
extremely
fortunate
in
having
a
gentleman
of
your
manners
and
appearance
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
of
it
too
,
sir
,
"
said
Augustus
Cooper
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
hope
we
shall
be
better
acquainted
,
sir
,
"
said
Signor
Billsmethi
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sure
I
hope
we
shall
too
,
sir
,
"
responded
Augustus
Cooper
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
the
door
opened
,
and
in
came
a
young
lady
,
with
her
hair
curled
in
a
crop
all
over
her
head
,
and
her
shoes
tied
in
sandals
all
over
her
ankles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
run
away
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Signor
Billsmethi
;
for
the
young
lady
did
n't
know
Mr
Cooper
was
there
when
she
ran
in
,
and
was
going
to
run
out
again
in
her
modesty
,
all
in
confusion
-
like
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
run
away
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Signor
Billsmethi
,
<EOS>
"
this
is
Mr
Cooper
---
Mr
Cooper
,
of
Fetter
-
lane
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cooper
,
my
daughter
,
sir
---
Miss
Billsmethi
,
sir
,
who
I
hope
will
have
the
pleasure
of
dancing
many
a
quadrille
,
minuet
,
gavotte
,
country
-
dance
,
fandango
,
double
-
hornpipe
,
and
farinagholkajingo
with
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
She
dances
them
all
,
sir
;
and
so
shall
you
,
sir
,
before
you
're
a
quarter
older
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
Signor
Bellsmethi
slapped
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
on
the
back
,
as
if
he
had
known
him
a
dozen
years
,
---
so
friendly
;
---
and
Mr
Cooper
bowed
to
the
young
lady
,
and
the
young
lady
curtseyed
to
him
,
and
Signor
Billsmethi
said
they
were
as
handsome
a
pair
as
ever
he
'd
wish
to
see
;
upon
which
the
young
lady
exclaimed
,
"
Lor
,
pa
!
"
and
blushed
as
red
as
Mr
Cooper
himself
<EOS>
---
you
might
have
thought
they
were
both
standing
under
a
red
lamp
at
a
chemist
's
shop
;
and
before
Mr
Cooper
went
away
<EOS>
it
was
settled
that
he
should
join
the
family
circle
that
very
night
---
taking
them
just
as
they
were
---
no
ceremony
nor
nonsense
of
that
kind
---
and
learn
his
positions
in
order
that
he
might
lose
no
time
,
and
be
able
to
come
out
at
the
forthcoming
ball
.
   
<EOS>
Well
;
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
went
away
to
one
of
the
cheap
shoemakers
'
shops
in
Holborn
,
where
gentlemen
's
dress
-
pumps
are
seven
-
and
-
sixpence
,
and
<EOS>
men
's
strong
walking
just
nothing
at
all
,
and
bought
a
pair
of
the
regular
seven
-
and
-
sixpenny
,
long
-
quartered
,
town
-
mades
,
in
which
he
astonished
himself
quite
as
much
as
his
mother
,
and
sallied
forth
to
Signor
Billsmethi
's
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
four
other
private
pupils
in
the
parlour
:
 
two
ladies
and
two
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Such
nice
people
!
 
<EOS>
Not
a
bit
of
pride
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
ladies
in
particular
,
who
was
in
training
for
a
Columbine
,
was
remarkably
affable
;
and
she
and
Miss
Billsmethi
took
such
an
interest
in
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
,
and
joked
,
and
smiled
,
and
looked
so
bewitching
,
that
he
got
quite
at
home
,
and
learnt
his
steps
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
practising
was
over
,
Signor
Billsmethi
,
and
Miss
Billsmethi
,
and
Master
Billsmethi
,
and
a
young
lady
,
and
the
two
ladies
,
and
the
two
gentlemen
,
danced
a
quadrille
---
none
of
your
slipping
and
sliding
about
,
but
regular
warm
work
,
flying
into
corners
,
and
diving
among
chairs
,
and
shooting
out
at
the
door
,
---
something
like
dancing
!
 
<EOS>
Signor
Billsmethi
in
particular
,
notwithstanding
his
having
a
little
fiddle
to
play
all
the
time
,
was
out
on
the
landing
every
figure
,
and
Master
Billsmethi
,
when
everybody
else
was
breathless
,
danced
a
hornpipe
,
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
,
and
a
cheese
-
plate
on
his
head
,
to
the
unqualified
admiration
of
the
whole
company
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
Signor
Billsmethi
insisted
,
as
they
were
so
happy
,
that
they
should
all
stay
to
supper
,
and
proposed
sending
Master
Billsmethi
for
the
beer
and
spirits
,
whereupon
the
two
gentlemen
swore
,
"
strike
<EOS>
'em
wulgar
if
they
'd
stand
that
;
"
and
were
just
going
to
quarrel
who
should
pay
for
it
,
when
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
said
he
would
,
if
they
'd
have
the
kindness
to
allow
him
---
and
they
HAD
the
kindness
to
allow
him
;
and
Master
Billsmethi
brought
the
beer
in
a
can
,
and
the
rum
in
a
quart
pot
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
regular
night
of
it
;
and
Miss
Billsmethi
squeezed
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
's
hand
under
the
table
;
and
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
returned
the
squeeze
,
and
returned
home
too
,
at
something
to
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
he
was
put
to
bed
by
main
force
by
the
apprentice
,
after
repeatedly
expressing
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
pitch
his
revered
parent
out
of
the
second
-
floor
window
,
and
to
throttle
the
apprentice
with
his
own
neck
-
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
Weeks
had
worn
on
,
and
the
seven
-
and
-
sixpenny
town
-
mades
had
nearly
worn
out
,
when
the
night
arrived
for
the
grand
dress
-
ball
at
which
the
whole
of
the
five
-
and
-
seventy
pupils
were
to
meet
together
,
for
the
first
time
that
season
,
and
to
take
out
some
portion
of
their
respective
four
-
and
-
sixpences
in
lamp
-
oil
and
fiddlers
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
had
ordered
a
new
coat
for
the
occasion
---
a
two
-
pound
-
tenner
from
Turnstile
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
first
appearance
in
public
;
and
,
after
a
grand
Sicilian
shawl
-
dance
by
fourteen
young
ladies
in
character
,
he
was
to
open
the
quadrille
department
with
Miss
Billsmethi
herself
,
with
whom
he
had
become
quite
intimate
since
his
first
introduction
.
 
<EOS>
It
WAS
a
night
!
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
admirably
arranged
.
 
<EOS>
The
sandwich
-
boy
took
the
hats
and
bonnets
at
the
street
-
door
;
there
was
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
in
the
back
parlour
,
on
which
Miss
Billsmethi
made
tea
and
coffee
for
such
of
the
gentlemen
as
chose
to
pay
for
it
,
and
such
of
the
ladies
as
the
gentlemen
treated
;
red
port
-
wine
negus
and
lemonade
were
handed
round
at
eighteen
-
pence
a
head
;
and
in
pursuance
of
a
previous
engagement
with
the
public
-
house
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
an
extra
potboy
was
laid
on
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
nothing
could
exceed
the
arrangements
,
except
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
Such
ladies
!
 
<EOS>
Such
pink
silk
stockings
!
 
<EOS>
Such
artificial
flowers
!
 
<EOS>
Such
a
number
of
cabs
!
 
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
one
cab
set
down
a
couple
of
ladies
,
than
another
cab
drove
up
and
set
down
another
couple
of
ladies
,
and
they
all
knew
:
 
not
only
one
another
,
but
the
majority
of
the
gentlemen
into
the
bargain
,
which
made
it
all
as
pleasant
and
lively
as
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
Signor
Billsmethi
,
in
black
tights
,
with
a
large
blue
bow
in
his
buttonhole
,
introduced
the
ladies
to
such
of
the
gentlemen
as
were
strangers
:
 
and
the
ladies
talked
away
---
and
laughed
they
did
---
it
was
delightful
to
see
them
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
the
shawl
-
dance
,
it
was
the
most
exciting
thing
that
ever
was
beheld
;
there
was
such
a
whisking
,
and
rustling
,
and
fanning
,
and
getting
ladies
into
a
tangle
with
artificial
flowers
,
and
then
disentangling
them
again
!
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
's
share
in
the
quadrille
,
he
got
through
it
admirably
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
missing
from
his
partner
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
certainly
,
and
discovered
on
such
occasions
to
be
either
dancing
with
laudable
perseverance
in
another
set
,
or
sliding
about
in
perspective
,
without
any
definite
object
;
but
,
generally
speaking
,
they
managed
to
shove
him
through
the
figure
,
until
he
turned
up
in
the
right
place
.
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
when
he
had
finished
,
a
great
many
ladies
and
gentlemen
came
up
and
complimented
him
very
much
,
and
said
they
had
never
seen
a
beginner
do
anything
like
it
before
;
and
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
himself
,
and
everybody
else
into
the
bargain
;
and
"
stood
"
considerable
quantities
of
spirits
-
and
-
water
,
negus
,
and
compounds
,
for
the
use
and
behoof
of
two
or
three
dozen
very
particular
friends
,
selected
from
the
select
circle
of
five
-
and
-
seventy
pupils
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
whether
it
was
the
strength
of
the
compounds
,
or
the
beauty
of
the
ladies
,
or
what
not
,
it
did
so
happen
that
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
encouraged
,
rather
than
repelled
,
the
very
flattering
attentions
of
a
young
lady
in
brown
gauze
over
white
calico
who
had
appeared
particularly
struck
with
him
from
the
first
;
and
when
the
encouragements
had
been
prolonged
for
some
time
,
Miss
Billsmethi
betrayed
her
spite
and
jealousy
thereat
by
calling
the
young
lady
in
brown
gauze
a
"
creeter
,
"
which
induced
the
young
lady
in
brown
gauze
to
retort
,
in
certain
sentences
containing
a
taunt
founded
on
the
payment
of
four
-
and
-
sixpence
a
quarter
,
which
reference
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
,
being
then
and
there
in
a
state
of
considerable
bewilderment
,
expressed
his
entire
concurrence
in
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Billsmethi
,
thus
renounced
<EOS>
,
forthwith
began
screaming
in
the
loudest
key
of
her
voice
,
at
the
rate
of
fourteen
screams
a
minute
;
and
being
unsuccessful
,
in
an
onslaught
on
the
eyes
and
face
,
first
of
the
lady
in
gauze
and
then
of
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
,
called
distractedly
on
the
other
three
-
and
-
seventy
pupils
to
furnish
her
with
oxalic
acid
for
her
own
private
drinking
;
and
,
the
call
not
being
honoured
,
made
another
rush
at
Mr
Cooper
,
and
then
had
her
stay
-
lace
cut
,
and
was
carried
off
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
,
not
being
remarkable
for
quickness
of
apprehension
,
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
all
this
meant
,
until
Signor
Billsmethi
explained
it
in
a
most
satisfactory
manner
,
by
stating
to
the
pupils
,
that
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
had
made
and
confirmed
divers
promises
of
marriage
to
his
daughter
on
divers
occasions
,
and
had
now
basely
deserted
her
;
on
which
,
the
indignation
of
the
pupils
became
universal
;
and
as
several
chivalrous
gentlemen
inquired
rather
pressingly
of
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
,
whether
he
required
anything
for
his
own
use
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
whether
he
"
wanted
anything
for
himself
,
"
he
deemed
it
prudent
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
upshot
of
the
matter
was
,
that
a
lawyer
's
letter
came
next
day
,
and
an
action
was
commenced
next
week
;
and
that
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
,
after
walking
twice
to
the
Serpentine
for
the
purpose
of
drowning
himself
,
and
coming
twice
back
without
doing
it
,
made
a
confidante
of
his
mother
,
who
compromised
the
matter
with
twenty
pounds
from
the
till
:
 
which
made
twenty
pounds
four
shillings
and
sixpence
paid
to
Signor
Billsmethi
,
exclusive
of
treats
and
pumps
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Augustus
Cooper
went
back
and
lived
with
his
mother
,
and
there
he
lives
to
this
day
;
and
as
he
has
lost
his
ambition
for
society
,
and
never
goes
into
the
world
,
he
will
never
see
this
account
of
himself
,
and
will
never
be
any
the
wiser
.
   
<EOS>
Shabby
-
genteel
people
<EOS>
There
are
certain
descriptions
of
people
who
,
oddly
enough
,
appear
to
appertain
exclusively
to
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
You
meet
them
,
every
day
,
in
the
streets
of
London
,
but
no
one
ever
encounters
them
elsewhere
;
they
seem
indigenous
to
the
soil
,
and
to
belong
as
exclusively
to
London
as
its
own
smoke
,
or
the
dingy
bricks
and
mortar
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
illustrate
the
remark
by
a
variety
of
examples
,
but
,
in
our
present
sketch
,
we
will
only
advert
to
one
class
as
a
specimen
---
that
class
which
is
so
aptly
and
expressively
designated
as
"
shabby
-
genteel
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
shabby
people
,
God
knows
,
may
be
found
anywhere
,
and
genteel
people
are
not
articles
of
greater
scarcity
out
of
London
than
in
it
;
but
this
compound
of
the
two
---
this
shabby
-
gentility
---
is
as
purely
local
as
the
statue
at
Charing
-
cross
,
or
the
pump
at
Aldgate
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
worthy
of
remark
,
too
,
that
only
men
are
shabby
-
genteel
;
a
woman
is
always
either
dirty
and
slovenly
in
the
extreme
,
or
neat
and
respectable
,
however
poverty
-
stricken
in
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
poor
man
,
"
who
has
seen
better
days
,
"
as
the
phrase
goes
,
is
a
strange
compound
of
dirty
-
slovenliness
and
wretched
attempts
at
faded
smartness
.
   
<EOS>
We
will
endeavour
to
explain
our
conception
of
the
term
which
forms
the
title
of
this
paper
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
meet
a
man
,
lounging
up
Drury
-
Lane
,
or
leaning
with
his
back
against
a
post
in
Long
-
acre
,
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
a
pair
of
drab
trousers
plentifully
besprinkled
with
grease
-
spots
:
 
the
trousers
made
very
full
over
the
boots
,
and
ornamented
with
two
cords
down
the
outside
of
each
leg
---
wearing
,
also
,
what
has
been
a
brown
coat
with
bright
buttons
,
and
a
hat
very
much
pinched
up
at
the
side
,
cocked
over
his
right
eye
---
do
n't
pity
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
shabby
-
genteel
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
harmonic
meetings
"
at
some
fourth
-
rate
public
-
house
,
or
the
purlieus
of
a
private
theatre
,
are
his
chosen
haunts
;
he
entertains
a
rooted
antipathy
to
any
kind
of
work
,
and
is
on
familiar
terms
with
several
pantomime
men
at
the
large
houses
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
see
hurrying
along
a
by
-
street
,
keeping
as
close
as
he
can
to
the
area
-
railings
,
a
man
of
about
forty
or
fifty
,
clad
in
an
old
rusty
suit
of
threadbare
black
cloth
which
shines
with
constant
wear
as
if
it
had
been
bees
-
waxed
---
the
trousers
tightly
strapped
down
,
partly
for
the
look
of
the
thing
and
partly
to
keep
his
old
shoes
from
slipping
off
at
the
heels
,
---
if
you
observe
,
too
,
that
his
yellowish
-
white
neckerchief
is
carefully
pinned
up
,
to
conceal
the
tattered
garment
underneath
,
and
that
his
hands
are
encased
in
the
remains
of
an
old
pair
of
beaver
gloves
,
you
may
set
him
down
as
a
shabby
-
genteel
man
.
 
<EOS>
A
glance
at
that
depressed
face
,
and
timorous
air
of
conscious
poverty
,
will
make
your
heart
ache
---
always
supposing
that
you
are
neither
a
philosopher
nor
a
political
economist
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
once
haunted
by
a
shabby
-
genteel
man
;
he
was
bodily
present
to
our
senses
all
day
,
and
he
was
in
our
mind
's
eye
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
of
whom
Sir
Walter
Scott
speaks
in
his
Demonology
,
did
not
suffer
half
the
persecution
from
his
imaginary
gentleman
-
usher
in
black
velvet
,
that
we
sustained
from
our
friend
in
quondam
black
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
He
first
attracted
our
notice
,
by
sitting
opposite
to
us
in
the
reading
-
room
at
the
British
Museum
;
and
what
made
the
man
more
remarkable
was
,
that
he
always
had
before
him
a
couple
of
shabby
-
genteel
books
---
two
old
dog's
-
eared
folios
,
in
mouldy
worm
-
eaten
covers
,
which
had
once
been
smart
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
his
chair
,
every
morning
,
just
as
the
clock
struck
ten
;
he
was
always
the
last
to
leave
the
room
in
the
afternoon
;
and
when
he
did
,
he
quitted
it
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knew
not
where
else
to
go
,
for
warmth
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
used
to
sit
all
day
,
as
close
to
the
table
as
possible
,
in
order
to
conceal
the
lack
of
buttons
on
his
coat
:
with
his
old
hat
carefully
deposited
at
his
feet
,
where
he
evidently
flattered
himself
it
escaped
observation
.
   
<EOS>
About
two
o'clock
,
you
would
see
him
munching
a
French
roll
or
a
penny
loaf
;
not
taking
it
boldly
out
of
his
pocket
at
once
,
like
a
man
who
knew
he
was
only
making
a
lunch
;
but
breaking
off
little
bits
in
his
pocket
,
and
eating
them
by
stealth
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
too
well
it
was
his
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
first
saw
this
poor
object
,
we
thought
it
quite
impossible
that
his
attire
could
ever
become
worse
.
 
<EOS>
We
even
went
so
far
,
as
to
speculate
on
the
possibility
of
his
shortly
appearing
in
a
decent
second
-
hand
suit
.
 
<EOS>
We
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
;
he
grew
more
and
more
shabby
-
genteel
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
buttons
dropped
off
his
waistcoat
,
one
by
one
;
then
,
he
buttoned
his
coat
;
and
when
one
side
of
the
coat
was
reduced
to
the
same
condition
as
the
waistcoat
,
he
buttoned
it
over
---
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
somewhat
better
at
the
beginning
of
the
week
than
at
the
conclusion
,
because
the
neckerchief
,
though
yellow
,
was
not
quite
so
dingy
;
and
,
in
the
midst
of
all
this
wretchedness
,
he
never
appeared
without
gloves
and
straps
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
in
this
state
for
a
week
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
one
of
the
buttons
on
the
back
of
the
coat
fell
off
,
and
then
the
man
himself
disappeared
,
and
we
thought
he
was
dead
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
sitting
at
the
same
table
about
a
week
after
his
disappearance
,
and
as
our
eyes
rested
on
his
vacant
chair
,
we
insensibly
fell
into
a
train
of
meditation
on
the
subject
of
his
retirement
from
public
life
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
wondering
whether
he
had
hung
himself
,
or
thrown
himself
off
a
bridge
---
whether
he
really
was
dead
or
had
only
been
arrested
---
when
our
conjectures
were
suddenly
set
at
rest
by
the
entry
of
the
man
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
undergone
some
strange
metamorphosis
,
and
walked
up
the
centre
of
the
room
with
an
air
which
showed
he
was
fully
conscious
of
the
improvement
in
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
odd
.
 
<EOS>
His
clothes
were
a
fine
,
deep
,
glossy
black
;
and
yet
they
looked
like
the
same
suit
;
nay
,
there
were
the
very
darns
with
which
old
acquaintance
had
made
us
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
The
hat
,
too
---
nobody
could
mistake
the
shape
of
that
hat
,
with
its
high
crown
gradually
increasing
in
circumference
towards
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
Long
service
had
imparted
to
it
a
reddish
-
brown
tint
;
but
,
now
,
it
was
as
black
as
the
coat
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
flashed
suddenly
upon
us
---
they
had
been
"
revived
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
deceitful
liquid
that
black
and
blue
reviver
;
we
have
watched
its
effects
on
many
a
shabby
-
genteel
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
betrays
its
victims
into
a
temporary
assumption
of
importance
:
 
possibly
into
the
purchase
of
a
new
pair
of
gloves
,
or
a
cheap
stock
,
or
some
other
trifling
article
of
dress
.
 
<EOS>
It
elevates
their
spirits
for
a
week
,
only
to
depress
them
,
if
possible
,
below
their
original
level
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
in
this
case
;
the
transient
dignity
of
the
unhappy
man
decreased
,
in
exact
proportion
as
the
"
reviver
"
wore
off
.
 
<EOS>
The
knees
of
the
unmentionables
,
and
the
elbows
of
the
coat
,
and
the
seams
generally
,
soon
began
to
get
alarmingly
white
.
 
<EOS>
The
hat
was
once
more
deposited
under
the
table
,
and
its
owner
crept
into
his
seat
as
quietly
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
week
of
incessant
small
rain
and
mist
.
 
<EOS>
At
its
expiration
the
"
reviver
"
had
entirely
vanished
,
and
the
shabby
-
genteel
man
never
afterwards
attempted
to
effect
any
improvement
in
his
outward
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
name
any
particular
part
of
town
as
the
principal
resort
of
shabby
-
genteel
men
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
met
a
great
many
persons
of
this
description
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
inns
of
court
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
met
with
,
in
Holborn
,
between
eight
and
ten
any
morning
;
and
whoever
has
the
curiosity
to
enter
the
Insolvent
Debtors
'
Court
will
observe
,
both
among
spectators
and
practitioners
,
a
great
variety
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
went
on
"
Change
,
by
any
chance
,
without
seeing
some
shabby
-
genteel
men
,
and
we
have
often
wondered
what
earthly
business
they
can
have
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
sit
there
,
for
hours
,
leaning
on
great
,
dropsical
,
mildewed
umbrellas
,

eating
Abernethy
biscuits

<EOS>
Nobody
speaks
to
them
,
nor
they
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
On
consideration
,
we
remember
to
have
occasionally
seen
two
shabby
-
genteel
men
conversing
together
on
"
Change
,
but
our
experience
assures
us
that
this
is
an
uncommon
circumstance
,
occasioned
by
the
offer
of
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
or
some
such
civility
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
task
of
equal
difficulty
,
either
to
assign
any
particular
spot
for
the
residence
of
these
beings
,
or
to
endeavour
to
enumerate
their
general
occupations
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
never
engaged
in
business
with
more
than
one
shabby
-
genteel
man
;
and
he
was
a
drunken
engraver
,
and
lived
in
a
damp
back
-
parlour
in
a
new
row
of
houses
at
Camden
-
town
,
half
street
,
half
brick
-
field
,
somewhere
near
the
canal
.
 
<EOS>
A
shabby
-
genteel
man
may
have
no
occupation
,
or
he
may
be
a
corn
agent
,
or
a
coal
agent
,
or
a
wine
merchant
,
or
a
collector
of
debts
,
or
a
broker
's
assistant
,
or
a
broken
-
down
attorney
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
a
clerk
of
the
lowest
description
,
or
a
contributor
to
the
press
of
the
same
grade
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
our
readers
have
noticed
these
men
,
in
their
walks
,
as
often
as
we
have
,
we
know
not
;
this
we
know
---
that
the
miserably
poor
man
(
no
matter
whether
he
owes
his
distresses
to
his
own
conduct
,
or
that
of
others
)
who
feels
his
poverty
and
vainly
strives
to
conceal
it
,
is
one
of
the
most
pitiable
objects
in
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Such
objects
,
with
few
exceptions
,
are
shabby
-
genteel
people
.
   
<EOS>
Making
a
night
of
it
<EOS>
Damon
and
Pythias
were
undoubtedly
very
good
fellows
in
their
way
:
<EOS>
the
former
for
his
extreme
readiness
to
put
in
special
bail
for
a
friend
:
 
and
the
latter
for
a
certain
trump
-
like
punctuality
in
turning
up
just
in
the
very
nick
of
time
,
scarcely
less
remarkable
.
<EOS>
Many
points
in
their
character
have
,
however
,
grown
obsolete
.
<EOS>
Damons
are
rather
hard
to
find
,
in
these
days
of
imprisonment
for
debt
(
except
the
sham
ones
,
and
they
cost
half
-
a
-
crown
)
;
and
,
as
to
the
Pythiases
,
the
few
that
have
existed
in
these
degenerate
times
,
have
had
an
unfortunate
knack
of
making
themselves
scarce
,
at
the
very
moment
when
their
appearance
would
have
been
strictly
classical
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
actions
of
these
heroes
,
however
,
can
find
no
parallel
in
modern
times
,
their
friendship
can
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
Damon
and
Pythias
on
the
one
hand
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
Potter
and
Smithers
on
the
other
;
and
,
lest
the
two
last
-
mentioned
names
should
never
have
reached
the
ears
of
our
unenlightened
readers
,
we
can
do
no
better
than
make
them
acquainted
with
the
owners
thereof
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
Potter
,
then
,
was
a
clerk
in
the
city
,
and
Mr
Robert
Smithers
was
a
ditto
in
the
same
;
their
incomes
were
limited
,
but
their
friendship
was
unbounded
.
 
<EOS>
They
lived
in
the
same
street
,
walked
into
town
every
morning
at
the
same
hour
,
dined
at
the
same
slap
-
bang
every
day
,
and
revelled
in
each
other
's
company
very
night
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
knit
together
by
the
closest
ties
of
intimacy
and
friendship
,
or
,
as
Mr
Thomas
Potter
touchingly
observed
,
they
were
"
thick
-
and
-
thin
pals
,
and
nothing
but
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
spice
of
romance
in
Mr
Smithers
's
disposition
,
a
ray
of
poetry
,
a
gleam
of
misery
,
a
sort
of
consciousness
of
<EOS>
he
did
n't
exactly
know
what
,
coming
across
him
he
did
n't
precisely
know
why
---
which
stood
out
in
fine
relief
against
the
off
-
hand
,
dashing
,
amateur
-
pickpocket
-
sort
-
of
-
manner
,
which
distinguished
Mr
Potter
in
an
eminent
degree
.
   
<EOS>
The
peculiarity
of
their
respective
dispositions
,
extended
itself
to
their
individual
costume
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Smithers
generally
appeared
in
public
in
a
surtout
and
shoes
,
with
a
narrow
black
neckerchief
and
a
brown
hat
,
very
much
turned
up
at
the
sides
---
<EOS>
peculiarities
which
Mr
Potter
wholly
eschewed
,
for
it
was
his
ambition
to
do
something
in
the
celebrated
"
kiddy
"
or
stage
-
coach
way
,
and
he
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
invest
capital
in
the
purchase
of
a
rough
blue
coat
with
wooden
buttons
,
made
upon
the
fireman
's
principle
,
in
which
,
with
the
addition
of
a
low
-
crowned
,
flower
-
pot
-
saucer
-
shaped
hat
,
he
had
created
no
inconsiderable
sensation
at
the
Albion
in
Little
Russell
-
street
,
and
divers
other
places
of
public
and
fashionable
resort
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Potter
and
Mr
Smithers
had
mutually
agreed
that
,
on
the
receipt
of
their
quarter
's
salary
,
they
would
jointly
and
in
company
"
spend
the
evening
"
---
an
evident
misnomer
---
the
spending
applying
,
as
everybody
knows
,
not
to
the
evening
itself
but
to
all
the
money
the
individual
may
chance
to
be
possessed
of
,
on
the
occasion
to
which
reference
is
made
;
and
they
had
likewise
agreed
that
,
on
the
evening
aforesaid
,
they
would
"
make
a
night
of
it
"
---
an
expressive
term
,
implying
the
borrowing
of
several
hours
from
to
-
morrow
morning
,
adding
them
to
the
night
before
,
and
manufacturing
a
compound
night
of
the
whole
.
   
<EOS>
The
quarter
-
day
arrived
at
last
---
we
say
at
last
,
because
quarter
-
days
are
as
eccentric
as
comets
:
 
moving
wonderfully
quick
when
you
have
a
good
deal
to
pay
,
and
marvellously
slow
when
you
have
a
little
to
receive
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
Potter
and
Mr
Robert
Smithers
met
by
appointment
to
begin
the
evening
with
a
dinner
;
and
a
nice
,
snug
,
comfortable
dinner
they
had
,
consisting
of
a
little
procession
of
four
chops
and
four
kidneys
,
following
each
other
,
supported
on
either
side
by
a
pot
of
the
real
draught
stout
,
and
attended
by
divers
cushions
of
bread
,
and
wedges
of
cheese
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
cloth
was
removed
,
Mr
Thomas
Potter
ordered
the
waiter
to
bring
in
,
two
goes
of
his
best
Scotch
whiskey
,
with
warm
water
and
sugar
,
and
a
couple
of
his
"
very
mildest
"
Havannahs
,
which
the
waiter
did
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
Potter
mixed
his
grog
,
and
lighted
his
cigar
;
Mr
Robert
Smithers
did
the
same
;
and
then
,
Mr
Thomas
Potter
jocularly
proposed
as
the
first
toast
,
<EOS>
"
the
abolition
of
all
offices
whatever
"
(
not
sinecures
,
but
counting
-
houses
)
,
which
was
immediately
drunk
by
Mr
Robert
Smithers
,
with
enthusiastic
applause
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
went
on
,
talking
politics
,
puffing
cigars
,
and
sipping
whiskey
-
and
-
water
,
until
the
"
goes
"
---
most
appropriately
so
called
---
were
both
gone
,
which
Mr
Robert
Smithers
perceiving
,
immediately
ordered
in
two
more
goes
of
the
best
Scotch
whiskey
,
and
two
more
of
the
very
mildest
Havannahs
;
and
the
goes
kept
coming
in
,
and
the
mild
Havannahs
kept
going
out
,
until
,
what
with
the
drinking
,
and
lighting
,
and
puffing
,
and
the
stale
ashes
on
the
table
,
and
the
tallow
-
grease
on
the
cigars
,
Mr
Robert
Smithers
began
to
doubt
the
mildness
of
the
Havannahs
,
and
to
feel
very
much
as
if
he
had
been
sitting
in
a
hackney
-
coach
with
his
back
to
the
horses
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Thomas
Potter
,
he
WOULD
keep
laughing
out
loud
,
and
volunteering
inarticulate
declarations
that
he
was
"
all
right
;
"
in
proof
of
which
,
he
feebly
bespoke
the
evening
paper
after
the
next
gentleman
,
but
finding
it
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
discover
any
news
in
its
columns
,
or
to
ascertain
distinctly
whether
it
had
any
columns
at
all
,
walked
slowly
out
to
look
for
the
moon
,
and
,
after
coming
back
quite
pale
with
looking
up
at
the
sky
so
long
,
and
attempting
to
express
mirth
at
Mr
Robert
Smithers
having
fallen
asleep
,
by
various
galvanic
chuckles
,
laid
his
head
on
his
arm
,
and
went
to
sleep
also
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
again
,
Mr
Robert
Smithers
awoke
too
,
and
they
both
very
gravely
agreed
that
it
was
extremely
unwise
to
eat
so
many
pickled
walnuts
with
the
chops
,
as
it
was
a
notorious
fact
that
they
always
made
people
queer
and
sleepy
;
indeed
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
whiskey
and
cigars
,
there
was
no
knowing
what
harm
they
might
n't
have
done
'em
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
took
some
coffee
,
and
after
paying
the
bill
,
---
twelve
and
twopence
the
dinner
,
and
the
odd
tenpence
for
the
waiter
---
thirteen
shillings
in
all
---
started
out
on
their
expedition
to
manufacture
a
night
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
just
half
-
past
eight
,
so
they
thought
they
could
n't
do
better
than
go
at
half
-
price
to
the
slips
at
the
City
Theatre
,
which
they
did
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Robert
Smithers
,
who
had
become
extremely
poetical
after
the
settlement
of
the
bill
,
enlivening
the
walk
by
informing
Mr
Thomas
Potter
in
confidence
that
he
felt
an
inward
presentiment
of
approaching
dissolution
,
and
subsequently
embellishing
the
theatre
,
by
falling
asleep
with
his
head
and
both
arms
gracefully
drooping
over
the
front
of
the
boxes
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
quiet
demeanour
of
the
unassuming
Smithers
,
and
such
were
the
happy
effects
of
Scotch
whiskey
and
Havannahs
on
that
interesting
person
!
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Thomas
Potter
,
whose
great
aim
it
was
to
be
considered
as
a
"
knowing
card
,
"
a
"
fast
-
goer
,
"
and
so
forth
,
conducted
himself
in
a
very
different
manner
,
and
commenced
going
very
fast
indeed
---
rather
too
fast
at
last
,
for
the
patience
of
the
audience
to
keep
pace
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
first
entry
,
he
contented
himself
by
earnestly
calling
upon
the
gentlemen
in
the
gallery
to
"
flare
up
,
"
accompanying
the
demand
with
another
request
,
expressive
of
his
wish
that
they
would
instantaneously
"
form
a
union
,
"
both
which
requisitions
were
responded
to
,
in
the
manner
most
in
vogue
on
such
occasions
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
that
dog
a
bone
!
"
<EOS>
cried
one
gentleman
in
his
shirt
-
sleeves
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
have
you
been
a
having
half
a
pint
of
intermediate
beer
?
"
cried
a
second
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tailor
!
"
screamed
a
third
.
 
<EOS>
"
Barber
's
clerk
!
"
shouted
a
fourth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Throw
him
O
-
VER
!
"
<EOS>
roared
a
fifth
;
while
numerous
voices
concurred
in
desiring
Mr
Thomas
Potter
to
"
go
home
to
his
mother
!
"
 
<EOS>
All
these
taunts
<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
Potter
received
with
supreme
contempt
,
cocking
the
low
-
crowned
hat
a
little
more
on
one
side
,
whenever
any
reference
was
made
to
his
personal
appearance
,
and
,
standing
up
with
his
arms
a
-
kimbo
,
expressing
defiance
melodramatically
.
   
<EOS>
The
overture
---
to
which
these
various
sounds
had
been
an
AD
LIBITUM
accompaniment
---
concluded
,
the
second
piece
began
,
and
Mr
Thomas
Potter
,
emboldened
by
impunity
,
proceeded
to
behave
in
a
most
unprecedented
and
outrageous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
he
imitated
the
shake
of
the
principal
female
singer
;
then
,
groaned
at
the
blue
fire
;
then
,
affected
to
be
frightened
into
convulsions
of
terror
at
the
appearance
of
the
ghost
;
and
,
lastly
,
not
only
made
a
running
commentary
,
in
an
audible
voice
,
upon
the
dialogue
on
the
stage
,
but
actually
awoke
Mr
Robert
Smithers
,
who
,
hearing
his
companion
making
a
noise
,
and
having
a
very
indistinct
notion
where
he
was
,
or
what
was
required
of
him
,
immediately
,
by
way
of
imitating
a
good
example
,
set
up
the
most
unearthly
,
unremitting
,
and
appalling
howling
that
ever
audience
heard
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
"
Turn
them
out
!
"
<EOS>
was
the
general
cry
.
 
<EOS>
A
noise
,
as
of
shuffling
of
feet
,
and
men
being
knocked
up
with
violence
against
wainscoting
,
was
heard
:
a
hurried
dialogue
of
"
Come
out
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
I
wo
n't
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
You
shall
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
I
sha
n't
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
Give
me
your
card
,
Sir
?
"
---
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
scoundrel
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
forth
,
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
A
round
of
applause
betokened
the
approbation
of
the
audience
,
and
Mr
Robert
Smithers
and
Mr
Thomas
Potter
found
themselves
shot
with
astonishing
swiftness
into
the
road
,
without
having
had
the
trouble
of
once
putting
foot
to
ground
during
the
whole
progress
of
their
rapid
descent
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Robert
Smithers
,
being
constitutionally
one
of
the
slow
-
goers
,
and
having
had
quite
enough
of
fast
-
going
,
in
the
course
of
his
recent
expulsion
,
to
last
until
the
quarter
-
day
then
next
ensuing
at
the
very
least
,
had
no
sooner
emerged
with
his
companion
from
the
precincts
of
Milton
-
street
,
than
he
proceeded
to
indulge
in
circuitous
references
to
the
beauties
of
sleep
,
mingled
with
distant
allusions
to
the
propriety
of
returning
to
Islington
,
and
testing
the
influence
of
their
patent
Bramahs
over
the
street
-
door
locks
to
which
they
respectively
belonged
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
Potter
,
however
,
was
valorous
and
peremptory
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
come
out
to
make
a
night
of
it
:
 
and
a
night
must
be
made
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Robert
Smithers
,
who
was
three
parts
dull
,
and
the
other
dismal
,
despairingly
assented
;
and
they
went
into
a
wine
-
vaults
,
to
get
materials
for
assisting
them
in
making
a
night
;
where
they
found
a
good
many
young
ladies
,
and
various
old
gentlemen
,
and
a
plentiful
sprinkling
of
hackney
-
coachmen
and
cab
-
drivers
,
all
drinking
and
talking
together
;
and
Mr
Thomas
Potter
and
Mr
Robert
Smithers
drank
small
glasses
of
brandy
,
and
large
glasses
of
soda
,
until
they
began
to
have
a
very
confused
idea
,
either
of
things
in
general
,
or
of
anything
in
particular
;
and
,
when
they
had
done
treating
themselves
they
began
to
treat
everybody
else
;
and
the
rest
of
the
entertainment
was
a
confused
mixture
of
heads
and
heels
,
black
eyes
and
blue
uniforms
,
mud
and
gas
-
lights
,
thick
doors
,
and
stone

<EOS>
Then
,
as
standard
novelists
expressively
inform
us
---
"
all
was
a
blank
!
"
<EOS>
and
in
the
morning
the
blank
was
filled
up
with
the
words
"
STATION
-
HOUSE
,
"
and
the
station
-
house
was
filled
up
with
Mr
Thomas
Potter
,
Mr
Robert
Smithers
,
and
the
major
part
of
their
wine
-
vault
companions
of
the
preceding
night
,
with
a
comparatively
small
portion
of
clothing
of
any
kind
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
disclosed
at
the
Police
-
office
,
to
the
indignation
of
the
Bench
,
and
the
astonishment
of
the
spectators
,
how
one
Robert
Smithers
,
aided
and
abetted
by
one
Thomas
Potter
,
<EOS>
had
knocked
down
and
beaten
,
in
divers
streets
,
at
different
times
,
five
men
,
four
boys
,
and
three
women
;
how
the
said
Thomas
Potter
had
feloniously
obtained
possession
of
five
door
-
knockers
,
two
bell
-
handles
,
and
a
bonnet
;
how
Robert
Smithers
,
his
friend
,
had
sworn
,
at
least
forty
pounds
'
worth
of
oaths
,
at
the
rate
of
five
shillings
apiece
;
terrified
whole
streets
full
of
Her
Majesty
's
subjects
with
awful
shrieks
and
alarms
of
fire
;
destroyed
the
uniforms
of
five
policemen
;
and
committed
various
other
atrocities
,
too
numerous
to
recapitulate
.
<EOS>
And
the
magistrate
,
after
an
appropriate
reprimand
,
fined
Mr
Thomas
Potter
and
Mr
Thomas
Smithers
five
shillings
each
,
for
being
,
what
the
law
vulgarly
terms
,
drunk
;
and
thirty
-
four
pounds
for
seventeen
assaults
at
forty
shillings
a
-
head
,
with
liberty
to
speak
to
the
prosecutors
.
   
<EOS>
The
prosecutors
WERE
spoken
to
,
and
Messrs.
Potter
and
Smithers
lived
on
credit
,
for
a
quarter
,
as
best
they
might
;
and
,
although
the
prosecutors
expressed
their
readiness
to
be
assaulted
twice
a
week
,
on
the
same
terms
,
they
have
never
since
been
detected
in
"
making
a
night
of
it
.

<EOS>
The
prisoners
'
van
<EOS>
We
were
passing
the
corner
of
Bow
-
street
,
on
our
return
from
a
lounging
excursion
the
other
afternoon
,
when
a
crowd
,
assembled
round
the
door
of
the
Police
-
office
,
attracted
our
attention
.
 
<EOS>
We
turned
up
the
street
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
thirty
or
forty
people
,
standing
on
the
pavement
and
half
across
the
road
;
and
a
few
stragglers
were
patiently
stationed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
---
all
evidently
waiting
in
expectation
of
some
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
We
waited
too
,
a
few
minutes
,
but
nothing
occurred
;
so
,
we
turned
round
to
an
unshorn
,
sallow
-
looking
cobbler
,
who
was
standing
next
us
with
his
hands
under
the
bib
of
his
apron
,
and
put
the
usual
question
of
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
cobbler
eyed
us
from
head
to
foot
,
with
superlative
contempt
,
and
laconically
replied
"
Nuffin
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
we
were
perfectly
aware
that
if
two
men
stop
in
the
street
to
look
at
any
given
object
,
or
even
to
gaze
in
the
air
,
two
hundred
men
will
be
assembled
in
no
time
;
but
,
as
we
knew
very
well
that
no
crowd
of
people
could
by
possibility
remain
in
a
street
for
five
minutes
without
getting
up
a
little
amusement
among
themselves
,
unless
they
had
some
absorbing
object
in
view
,
the
natural
inquiry
next
in
order
was
,
"
What
are
all
these
people
waiting
here
for
?
"
---
"
Her
Majesty
's
carriage
,
"
replied
the
cobbler
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
still
more
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
imagine
what
earthly
business
Her
Majesty
's
carriage
could
have
at
the
Public
Office
,
Bow
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
beginning
to
ruminate
on
the
possible
causes
of
such
an
uncommon
appearance
,
when
a
general
exclamation
from
all
the
boys
in
the
crowd
of
"
Here
's
the
wan
!
"
<EOS>
caused
us
to
raise
our
heads
,
and
look
up
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
The
covered
vehicle
,
in
which
prisoners
are
conveyed
from
the
police
-
offices
to
the
different
prisons
,
was
coming
along
at
full
speed
.
 
<EOS>
It
then
occurred
to
us
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
Her
Majesty
's
carriage
was
merely
another
name
for
the
prisoners
'
van
,
conferred
upon
it
,
not
only
by
reason
of
the
superior
gentility
of
the
term
,
but
because
the
aforesaid
van
is
maintained
at
Her
Majesty
's
expense
:
 
having
been
originally
started
for
the
exclusive
accommodation
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
under
the
necessity
of
visiting
the
various
houses
of
call
known
by
the
general
denomination
of
"
Her
Majesty
's
Gaols
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
van
drew
up
at
the
office
-
door
,
and
the
people
thronged
round
the
steps
,
just
leaving
a
little
alley
for
the
prisoners
to
pass
through
.
 
<EOS>
Our
friend
the
cobbler
,
and
the
other
stragglers
,
crossed
over
,
and
we
followed
their
example
.
 
<EOS>
The
driver
,
and
another
man
who
had
been
seated
by
his
side
in
front
of
the
vehicle
,
dismounted
,
and
were
admitted
into
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
The
office
-
door
was
closed
after
them
,
and
the
crowd
were
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
few
minutes
'
delay
,
the
door
again
opened
,
and
the
two
first
prisoners
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
a
couple
of
girls
,
of
whom
the
elder
---
could
not
be
more
than
sixteen
,
and
the
younger
of
whom
had
certainly
not
attained
her
fourteenth
year
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
were
sisters
,
was
evident
,
from
the
resemblance
which
still
subsisted
between
them
,
though
two
additional
years
of
depravity
had
fixed
their
brand
upon
the
elder
girl
's
features
,
as
legibly
as
if
a
red
-
hot
iron
had
seared
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
both
gaudily
dressed
,
the
younger
one
especially
;
and
,
although
there
was
a
strong
similarity
between
them
in
both
respects
,
which
was
rendered
the
more
obvious
by
their
being
handcuffed
together
,
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
greater
contrast
than
the
demeanour
of
the
two
presented
.
 
<EOS>
The
younger
girl
was
weeping
bitterly
---
not
for
display
,
or
in
the
hope
of
producing
effect
,
but
for
very
shame
:
 
<EOS>
her
face
was
buried
in
her
handkerchief
:
 
and
her
whole
manner
was
but
too
expressive
of
bitter
and
unavailing
sorrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
are
you
for
,
Emily
?
<EOS>
"
screamed
a
red
-
faced
woman
in
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
Six
weeks
and
labour
,
"
replied
the
elder
girl
with
a
flaunting
laugh
;
"
and
that
's
better
than
the
stone
jug
anyhow
;
the
mill
's
a
deal
better
than
the
Sessions
,
and
here
's
<EOS>
Bella
a
-
going
too
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
up
your
head
,
you
chicken
,
"
she
continued
,
boisterously
tearing
the
other
girl
's
handkerchief
away
;
"
Hold
up
your
head
,
and
show
'em
your
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
an't
jealous
,
<EOS>
but
I
'm
blessed
if
I
an't
game
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
That
's
right
,
old
gal
,
"
exclaimed
a
man
in
a
paper
cap
,
who
,
in
common
with
the
greater
part
of
the
crowd
,
had
been
inexpressibly
delighted
with
this
little
incident
.
<EOS>
---
"
Right
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
girl
;
"
ah
,
to
be
sure
;
what
's
the
odds
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
In
with
you
,
"
interrupted
the
driver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
be
in
a
hurry
,
coachman
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
"
and
recollect
I
want
to
be
set
down
in
Cold
Bath
Fields
---
large
house
with
a
high
garden
-
wall
in
front
;
you
ca
n't
mistake
it
.
 
<EOS>
Hallo
.
 
<EOS>
Bella
,
where
are
you
going
to
---
you
'll
pull
my
precious
arm
off
?
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
the
younger
girl
,
who
,
in
her
anxiety
to
hide
herself
in
the
caravan
,
had
ascended
the
steps
first
,
and
forgotten
the
strain
upon
the
handcuff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
down
,
and
let
's
show
you
the
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
after
jerking
the
miserable
girl
down
with
a
force
which
made
her
stagger
on
the
pavement
,
she
got
into
the
vehicle
,
and
was
followed
by
her
wretched
companion
.
   
<EOS>
These
two
girls
had
been
thrown
upon
London
streets
,
their
vices
and
debauchery
,
by
a
sordid
and
rapacious
mother
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
younger
girl
was
then
,
the
elder
had
been
once
;
and
what
the
elder
then
was
,
the
younger
must
soon
become
.
 
<EOS>
A
melancholy
prospect
,
but
how
surely
to
be
realised
;
a
tragic
drama
,
but
how
often
acted
!
 
<EOS>
Turn
to
the
prisons
and
police
offices
of
London
---
nay
,
look
into
the
very
streets
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
These
things
pass
before
our
eyes
,
day
after
day
,
and
hour
after
hour
---
they
have
become
such
matters
of
course
,
that
they
are
utterly
disregarded
.
 
<EOS>
The
progress
of
these
girls
in
crime
will
be
as
rapid
as
the
flight
of
a
pestilence
,
resembling
it
too
in
its
baneful
influence
and
wide
-
spreading
infection
.
 
<EOS>
Step
by
step
,
how
many
wretched
females
,
within
the
sphere
of
every
man
's
observation
,
have
become
involved
in
a
career
of
vice
,
frightful
to
contemplate
;
hopeless
at
its
commencement
,
loathsome
and
repulsive
in
its
course
;
friendless
,
forlorn
,
and
unpitied
,
at
its
miserable
conclusion
!
   
<EOS>
There
were
other
prisoners
---
boys
of
ten
,
as
hardened
in
vice
as
men
of
fifty
---
a
houseless
vagrant
,
going
joyfully
to
prison
as
a
place
of
food
and
shelter
,
handcuffed
to
a
man
whose
prospects
were
ruined
,
character
lost
,
and
family
rendered
destitute
,
by
his
first
offence
.
 
<EOS>
Our
curiosity
,
however
,
was
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
group
had
left
an
impression
on
our
mind
we
would
gladly
have
avoided
,
and
would
willingly
have
effaced
.
   
<EOS>
The
crowd
dispersed
;
the
vehicle
rolled
away
with
its
load
of
guilt
and
misfortune
;
and
we
saw
no
more
of

Chapter

First

<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
was
,
beyond
all
dispute
,
the
most
tidy
,
fidgety
,
thrifty
little
personage
that
ever
inhaled
the
smoke
of
London
;
and
the
house
of
Mrs
Tibbs
was
,
decidedly
,
the
neatest
in
all
Great
Coram
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
area
and
the
area
-
steps
,
and
the
street

and
the
street

door
steps
,
and
the
brass
handle
,
and
the
door
-
plate
,
and
the
knocker
,
and
the
fan
-
light
,
were
all
as
clean
and
bright
,
as
indefatigable
white
-
washing
,
and
hearth
-
stoning
,
and
scrubbing
and
rubbing
,
could
make
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
wonder
was
,
that
the
brass
door
-
plate
,
with
the
interesting
inscription
"
MRS
TIBBS
,
"
had
never
caught
fire
from
constant
friction
,
so
perseveringly
was
it
polished
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
meat
-
safe
-
looking
blinds
in
the
parlour
-
windows
,
blue
and
gold
curtains
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
spring
-
roller
blinds
,
as
Mrs
Tibbs
was
wo
nt
in
the
pride
of
her
heart
to
boast
,
"
all
the
way
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
bell
-
lamp
in
the
passage
looked
as
clear
as
a
soap
-
bubble
;
you
could
see
yourself
in
all
the
tables
,
and
French
-
polish
yourself
on
any
one
of
the
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
banisters
were
bees
-
waxed
;
and
the
very
stair
-
wires
made
your
eyes
wink
,
they
were
so
glittering
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
was
somewhat
short
of
stature
,
and
Mr
Tibbs
was
by
no
means
a
large
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
,
moreover
,
very
short
legs
,
but
,
by
way
of
indemnification
,
his
face
was
peculiarly
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
to
his
wife
what
the
0
is
in
90
<EOS>
---
he
was
of
some
importance
WITH
her
---
he
was
nothing
without
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
was
always
talking
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tibbs
rarely
spoke
;
but
,
if
it
were
at
any
time
possible
to
put
in
a
word
,
when
he
should
have
said
nothing
at
all
,
he
had
that
talent
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
detested
long
stories
,
and
Mr
Tibbs
had
one
,
the
conclusion
of
which
had
never
been
heard
by
his
most
intimate
friends
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
began
,
"
I
recollect
when
I
was
in
the
volunteer
corps
,
in
eighteen
hundred
and
six
,
"
---
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
spoke
very
slowly
and
softly
,
and
his
better
half
very
quickly
and
loudly
,
he
rarely
got
beyond
the
introductory
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
melancholy
specimen
of
the
story
-
teller
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
wandering
Jew
of
Joe
Millerism
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tibbs
enjoyed
a
small
independence
from
the
pension

about

a

<EOS>
His
father
,
mother
,
and
five
interesting
scions
from
the
same
stock
,
drew
a
like
sum
from
the
revenue
of
a
grateful
country
,
though
for
what
particular
service
was
never
known
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
this
said
independence
was
not
quite
sufficient
to
furnish
two
people
with
ALL
the
luxuries
of
this
life
,
it
had
occurred
to
the
busy
little
spouse
of
Tibbs
,
that
the
best
thing
she
could
do
with
a
legacy
of
700L.
,
would
be
to
take
and
furnish
a
tolerable
house
---
somewhere
in
that
partially

explored
tract
of
country
which
lies
between
the
British

Great

The

had
been
furnished

two

engaged
;
and
an
advertisement
inserted
in

informing
the

that

with
a
sudden
wish
to
go
out
boarding
and
lodging
;
voluminous
was
the
correspondence
between
Mrs
Tibbs
and
the
applicants
;
and
most
profound
was
the
secrecy
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
E
"
did
n't
like
this
;
"
I
"
could
n't
think
of
putting
up
with
that
;
"
I*O*U^
"
did
n't
think
the
terms
would
suit
him
;
and
"
G*R
"
had
never
slept
in
a
French
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
,
however
,
was
,
that
three
gentlemen
became
inmates
of
Mrs
Tibbs
's
house
,
on
terms
which
were
"
agreeable
to
all
parties
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
went
the
advertisement
again
,
and
a
lady
with
her
two
daughters
,
proposed
to
increase
---
not
their
families
,
but
Mrs
Tibbs
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charming
woman
,
that
Mrs
Maplesone
!
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
as
she
and
her
spouse
were
sitting
by
the
fire
after
breakfast
;
the
gentlemen
having
gone
out
on
their
several
avocations
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charming
woman
,
indeed
!
"
repeated
little
Mrs
Tibbs
,
more
by
way
of
soliloquy
than
anything
else
,
for
she
never
thought
of
consulting
her
husband
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
two
daughters
are
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
some
fish
to
-
day
;
they
'll
join
us
at
dinner
for
the
first
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tibbs
placed
the
poker
at
right
angles
with
the
fire
shovel
,
and
essayed
to
speak
,
but
recollected
he
had
nothing
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
,
"
continued
Mrs
T
,
"
have
kindly
volunteered
to
bring
their
own
piano
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tibbs
thought
of
the
volunteer
story
,
but
did
not
venture
it
.
   
<EOS>
A
bright
thought
struck
him
---
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
likely
---
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
lean
your
head
against
the
paper
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Tibbs
;
"
and
do
n't
put
your
feet
on
the
steel
fender
;
that
's
worse
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tibbs
took
his
head
from
the
paper
,
and
his
feet
from
the
fender
,
and
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
likely
one
of
the
young
ladies
may
set
her
cap
at
young
Mr
Simpson
,
and
you
know
a
marriage
---
"
   
"
A
what
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Mrs
Tibbs
.
 
<EOS>
Tibbs
modestly
repeated
his
former
suggestion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
wo
n't
mention
such
a
thing
,
"
said
Mrs
T.
 
<EOS>
"
A
marriage
,
indeed
to
rob
me
of
my
boarders
---
no
,
not
for
the
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tibbs
thought
in
his
own
mind
that
the
event
was
by
no
means
unlikely
,
but
,
as
he
never
argued
with
his
wife
,
he
put
a
stop
to
the
dialogue
,
by
observing
it
was
"
time
to
go
to
business
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
always
went
out
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
returned
at
five
in
the
afternoon
,
with
an
exceedingly
dirty
face
,
and
smelling
mouldy
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
knew
what
he
was
,
or
where
he
went
;
but
Mrs
Tibbs
used
to
say
with
an
air
of
great
importance
,
that
he
was
engaged
in
the
City
.
   
<EOS>
The
Miss
Maplesones
and
their
accomplished
parent
arrived
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
accompanied
by
a
most
astonishing
number
of
packages
.
 
<EOS>
Trunks
,
bonnet
-
boxes
,
muff
-
boxes
and
parasols
,
guitar
-
cases
,
and
parcels
of
all
imaginable
shapes
,
done
up
in
brown
paper
,
and
fastened
with
pins
,
filled
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
was
such
a
running
up
and
down
with
the
luggage
,
such
scampering
for
warm
water
for
the
ladies
to
wash
in
,
and
such
a
bustle
,
and
confusion
,
and
heating
of
servants
,
and
curling
-
irons
,
as
had
never
been
known
in
Great
Coram
-
street
before
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Mrs
Tibbs
was
quite
in
her
element
,
bustling
about
,
talking
incessantly
,
and
distributing
towels
and
soap
,
like
a
head
nurse
in
a
hospital
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
not
restored
to
its
usual
state
of
quiet
repose
,
until
the
ladies
were
safely
shut
up
in
their
respective
bedrooms
,
engaged
in
the
important
occupation
of
dressing
for
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
these
gals
'
andsome
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Simpson
of
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
,
another
of
the
boarders
,
as
they
were
amusing
themselves
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
before
dinner
,
by
lolling
on
sofas
,
and
contemplating
their
pumps
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
,
who
was
a
tallish
,
white
-
faced
young
man
,
with
spectacles
,
and
a
black
ribbon
round
his
neck
instead
of
a
neckerchief
---
a
most
interesting
person
;
a
poetical
walker
of
the
hospitals
,
and
a
"
very
talented
young
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
fond
of
"
lugging
"
into
conversation
all
sorts
of
quotations
from
Don
Juan
,
without
fettering
himself
by
the
propriety
of
their
application
;
in
which
particular
he
was
remarkably
independent
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
Mr
Simpson
,
was
one
of
those
young
men
,
who
are
in
society
what
walking
gentlemen
are
on
the
stage
,
only
infinitely
worse
skilled
in
his
vocation
than
the
most
indifferent
artist
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
empty
-
headed
as
the
great
bell
of
St
Paul
's
;
always
dressed
according
to
the
caricatures
published
in
the
monthly
fashion
;
and
spelt
Character
with
a
K^.
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
a
devilish
number
of
parcels
in
the
passage
when
I
came
home
,
"
simpered
Mr
Simpson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Materials
for
the
toilet
,
no
doubt
,
"
rejoined
the
Don
Juan
reader
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
Much
linen
,
lace
,
and
several
pair
Of
stockings
,
slippers
,
brushes
,
combs
,
complete
;
With
other
articles
of
ladies
fair
,
To
keep

beautiful
,
or
leave
them
neat

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
from
Milton
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Simpson
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
---
from
Byron
,
"
returned
Mr
Hicks
,
with
a
look
of
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
quite
sure
of
his
author
,
because
he
had
never
read
any
other
.
"
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Here
come
the
gals
,
"
and
they
both
commenced
talking
in
a
very
loud
key
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Maplesone
and
the
Miss
Maplesones
,
Mr
Hicks
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hicks
---
Mrs
Maplesone
and
the
Miss
Maplesones
,
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
with
a
very
red
face
,
for
she
had
been
superintending
the
cooking
operations
below
stairs
,
and
looked
like
a
wax
doll
on
a
sunny
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Simpson
,
I
beg
your
pardon
---
Mr
Simpson
---
Mrs
Maplesone
and
the
Miss
Maplesones
"
---
and
\
vice
versa
\.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
immediately
began
to
slide
about
with
much
politeness
,
and
to
look
as
if
they
wished
their
arms
had
been
legs
,
so
little
<EOS>
did
they
know
what
to
do
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
smiled
,
curtseyed
,
and
glided
into
chairs
,
and
dived
for
dropped
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
:
 
<EOS>
the
gentlemen
leant
against
two
of
the
curtain
-
pegs
;
Mrs
Tibbs
went
through
an
admirable
bit
of
serious
pantomime
with
a
servant
who
had
come
up
to
ask
some
question
about
the
fish
-
sauce
;
and
then
the
two
young
ladies
looked
at
each
other
;
and
everybody
else
appeared
to
discover
something
very
attractive
in
the
pattern
of
the
fender
.
   
<EOS>
"
Julia
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mrs
Maplesone
to
her
youngest
daughter
,
in
a
tone
loud
enough
for
the
remainder
of
the
company
to
hear
---
"
Julia
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Ma
.
"
   
"
Do
n't
stoop
.
"
<EOS>
---
This
was
said
for
the
purpose
of
directing
general
attention
to
Miss
Julia
's
figure
,
which
was
undeniable
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
looked
at
her
,
accordingly
,
and
there
was
another
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
had
the
most
uncivil
hackney
-
coachman
to
-
day
,
you
can
imagine
,
"
said
Mrs
Maplesone
to
Mrs
Tibbs
,
in
a
confidential
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
replied
the
hostess
,
with
an
air
of
great
commiseration
.
<EOS>
She
could
n't
say
more
,
for
the
servant
again
appeared
at
the
door
,
and
commenced
telegraphing
most
earnestly
to
her
"
Missis
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
hackney
-
coachmen
generally
ARE
uncivil
,
"
said
Mr
Hicks
in
his
most
insinuating
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Positively
I
think
they
are
,
"
replied
Mrs
Maplesone
,
as
if
the
idea
had
never
struck
her
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
cabmen
,
too
,
"
said
Mr
Simpson
.
 
<EOS>
This
remark
was
a
failure
,
for
no
one
intimated
,
by
word
or
sign
,
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
cabmen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Robinson
,
what
DO
you
want
?
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
to
the
servant
,
who
,
by
way
of
making
her
presence
known
to
her
mistress
,
had
been
giving
sundry
hems
and
sniffs
outside
the
door
during
the
preceding
five
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
master
wants
his
clean
things
,
"
replied
the
servant
,
taken
off
her
guard
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
young
men
turned
their
faces
to
the
window
,
and
"
went
off
"
like
a
couple
of
bottles
of
ginger
-
beer
;
the
ladies
put
their
handkerchiefs
to
their
mouths
;
and
little
Mrs
Tibbs
bustled
out
of
the
room
to
give
Tibbs
his
clean
linen
,
---
and
the
servant
warning
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Calton
,
the
remaining
boarder
,
shortly
afterwards
made
his
appearance
,
and
proved
a
surprising
promoter
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Calton
was
a
superannuated
beau
---
an
old
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
to
say
of
himself
that
although
his
features
were
not
regularly
handsome
,
they
were
striking
.
 
<EOS>
They
certainly
were
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
look
at
his
face
without
being
reminded
of
a
chubby
street
-
door
knocker
,
half
-
lion
half
-
monkey
;
and
the
comparison
might
be
extended
to
his
whole
character
and
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
stood
still
,
while
everything
else
had
been
moving
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
originated
a
conversation
,
or
started
an
idea
;
but
if
any
commonplace
topic
were
broached
,
or
,
to
pursue
the
comparison
,
if
anybody
LIFTED
HIM
UP
,
he
would
hammer
away
with
surprising
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
tic
-
douloureux
occasionally
,
and
then
he
might
be
said
to
be
muffled
,
because
he
did
not
make
quite
as
much
noise
as
at
other
times
,
when
he
would
go
on
prosing
,
rat
-
tat
-
tat
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
married
;
but
he
was
still
on
the
look
-
out
for
a
wife
with
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
life
interest
worth
about
300L.
a
year
---
he
was
exceedingly
vain
,
and
inordinately
selfish
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
acquired
the
reputation
of
being
the
very
pink
of
politeness
,
and
he
walked
round
the
park
,
and
up
Regent
-
street
,
every
day
.
   
<EOS>
This
respectable
personage
had
made
up
his
mind
to
render
himself
exceedingly
agreeable
to
Mrs
Maplesone
---
indeed
,
the
desire
of
being
as
amiable
as
possible
extended
itself
to
the
whole
party
;
Mrs
Tibbs
having
considered
it
an
admirable
little
bit
of
management
to
represent
to
the
gentlemen
that
she
had
SOME
reason
to
believe
the
ladies
were
fortunes
,
and
to
hint
to
the
ladies
,
that
all
the
gentlemen
were
"
eligible
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
little
flirtation
,
she
thought
,
might
keep
her
house
full
,
without
leading
to
any
other
result
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Maplesone
was
an
enterprising
widow
of
about
fifty
:
 
shrewd
,
scheming
,
and
good
-
looking
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
amiably
anxious
on
behalf
of
her
daughters
;
in
proof
whereof
she
used
to
remark
,
that
she
would
have
no
objection
to
marry
again
,
if
it
would
benefit
her
dear
girls
---
she
could
have
no
other
motive
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
dear
girls
"
themselves
were
not
at
all
insensible
to
the
merits
of
"
a
good
establishment
.
"
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
twenty
-
five
;
the
other
,
three
years
younger
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
at
different
watering
-
places
,
for
four
seasons
;
they
had
gambled
at
libraries
,
read
books
in
balconies
,
sold
at
fancy
fairs
,
danced
at
assemblies
,
talked
sentiment
---
in
short
,
they
had
done
all
that
industrious
girls
could
do
---
but
,
as
yet
,
to
no
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
magnificent
dresser
Mr
Simpson
is
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Matilda
Maplesone
to
her
sister
Julia
.
   
<EOS>
"
Splendid
!
"
returned
the
youngest
.
 
<EOS>
The
magnificent
individual
alluded
to
wore
a
maroon
-
coloured
dress
-
coat
,
with
a
velvet
collar
and
cuffs
of
the
same
tint
---
very
like
that
which
usually
invests
the
form
of
the
distinguished
unknown
who
condescends
to
play
the
"
swell
"
in
the
pantomime
at
"
Richardson
's
Show
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
whiskers
!
"
said
Miss
Julia
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charming
!
"
responded
her
sister
;
"
and
what
hair
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
hair
was
like
a
wig
,
and
distinguished
by
that
insinuating
wave
which
graces
the
shining
locks
of
those
CHEF
-
D'OEUVRES
of
art
surmounting
the
waxen
images
in
Bartellot
's
window
in
Regent
-
street
;
his
whiskers
meeting
beneath
his
chin
,
seemed
strings
wherewith
to
tie
it
on
,
ere
science
had
rendered
them
unnecessary
by
her
patent
invisible
springs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dinner
's
on
the
table
,
ma'am
,
if
you
please

"
said
the
boy
,
who
now
appeared
for
the
first
time
,
in
a
revived
black
coat
of
his
master
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
Mr
Calton
,
will
you
lead
Mrs
Maplesone
?
---
Thank
you

"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Simpson
offered
his
arm
to
Miss
Julia
;
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
escorted
the
lovely
Matilda
;
and
the
procession
proceeded
to
the
dining
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tibbs
was
introduced
,
and
Mr
Tibbs
bobbed
up
and
down
to
the
three
ladies
like
a
figure
in
a
Dutch
clock
,
with
a
powerful
spring
in
the
middle
of
his
body
,
and
then
dived
rapidly
into
his
seat
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
delighted
to
screen
himself
behind
a
soup
-
tureen
,
which
he
could
just
see
over
,
and
that
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
boarders
were
seated
,
a
lady
and
gentleman
alternately
,
like
the
layers
of
bread
and
meat
in
a
plate
of
sandwiches
;
and
then
Mrs
Tibbs
directed
James
to
take
off
the
covers
.
 
<EOS>
Salmon
,
lobster
-
sauce
,
giblet
-
soup
,
and
the
usual
accompaniments
were
discovered
:
potatoes
like
petrifactions
,
and
bits
of
toasted
bread
,
the
shape
and
size
of
blank
dice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Soup
for
Mrs
Maplesone
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
bustling
Mrs
Tibbs
.
<EOS>
She
always
called
her
husband
"
my
dear
"
before
company
.
 
<EOS>
Tibbs
,
who
had
been
eating
his
bread
,
and
calculating
how
long
it
would
be
before
he
should
get
any
fish
,
helped
the
soup
in
a
hurry
,
made
a
small
island
on
the
table
-
cloth
,
and
put
his
glass
upon
it
,
to
hide
it
from
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Julia
,
shall
I
assist
you
to
some
fish
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
---
very
little
---
oh
!
plenty
,
thank
you
"
(
a
bit
about
the
size
of
a
walnut
put
upon
the
plate
)
.
   
<EOS>
"
Julia
is
a
VERY
little
eater
,
"
said
Mrs
Maplesone
to
Mr
Calton
.
   
<EOS>
The
knocker
gave
a
single
rap
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
busy
eating
the
fish
with
his
eyes
:
 
<EOS>
so
he
only
ejaculated
,
"
Ah
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
to
her
spouse
after
every
one
else
had
been
helped
,
"
what
do
YOU
take
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
inquiry
was
accompanied
with
a
look
intimating
that
he
must
n't
say
fish
,
because
there
was
not
much
left
.
 
<EOS>
Tibbs
thought
the
frown
referred
to
the
island
on
the
table
-
cloth
;
he
therefore
coolly
replied
,
"
Why
---
I
'll
take
a
little
---
fish
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
fish
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
(
another
frown
)
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
,
"
replied
the
villain
,
with
an
expression
of
acute
hunger
depicted
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
The
tears
almost
started
to
Mrs
Tibbs
's
eyes
,
as
she
helped
her
"
wretch
of
a
husband
,
"
as
she
inwardly
called
him
,
to
the
last
eatable
bit
of
salmon
on
the
dish
.
   
<EOS>
"
James
,
take
this
to
your
master
,
and
take
away
your
master
's
knife
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
deliberate
revenge
,
as
Tibbs
never
could
eat
fish
without
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
constrained
to
chase
small
particles
of
salmon
round
and
round
his
plate
with
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
fork
,
<EOS>
the
number
of
successful
attempts
being
about
one
in
seventeen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
away
,
James
,
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
as
Tibbs
swallowed
the
fourth
mouthful
---
and
away
went
the
plates
like
lightning
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
a
bit
of
bread
,
James
,
"
said
the
poor
"
master
of
the
house
,
"
more
hungry
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
your
master
now
,
James
,
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
"
see
about
the
meat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
conveyed
in
the
tone
in
which
ladies
usually
give
admonitions
to
servants
in
company
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
low
one
;
but
which
,
like
a
stage
whisper
,
from
its
peculiar
emphasis
,
is
most
distinctly
heard
by
everybody
present
.
   
<EOS>
A
pause
ensued
,
before
the
table
was
replenished
---
a
sort
of
parenthesis
in
which
Mr
Simpson
,
Mr
Calton
,
and
Mr
Hicks
,
produced
respectively
a
bottle
of
sauterne
,
bucellas
,
and
sherry
,
and
took
wine
with
everybody
---
except
Tibbs
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
ever
thought
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
Between
the
fish
and
an
intimated
sirloin
,
there
was
a
prolonged
interval
.
   
<EOS>
Here
was
an
opportunity
for
Mr
Hicks
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
resist
the
singularly
appropriate
quotation
---
   
"
<EOS>
But
beef
is
rare
within
these
oxless
isles
;
Goats
'
flesh
there
is
,
no
doubt
,
and
kid
,
and
mutton
,
And
when
a
holiday
upon
them
smiles
,
A
joint
upon
their
barbarous
spits
they
put
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
ungentlemanly
behaviour
,
"
thought
little
Mrs
Tibbs
,
"
to
talk
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mr
Calton
,
filling
his
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tom
Moore
is
my
poet
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
mine
,
"
said
Mrs
Maplesone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
mine

"
said
Miss
Julia
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
mine
,
"
added
Mr
Simpson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
his
compositions
,
"
resumed
the
knocker
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Simpson
,
with
confidence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
Don
Juan
,
"
replied
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Julia
's
letter
,
"
suggested
Miss
Matilda
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
anything
be
grander
than
the
Fire
Worshippers
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Julia
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Simpson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
Paradise
and
the
Peri
,
"
said
the
old
beau
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
or
Paradise
and
the
Peer
,
"
repeated
Simpson
,
who
thought
he
was
getting
through
it
capitally
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
,
"
replied
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
,
who
,
as
we
have
before
hinted
,
never
had
read
anything
but
Don
Juan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
will
you
find
anything
finer
than
the
description
of
the
siege
,
at
the
commencement
of
the
seventh
canto
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Talking
of
a
siege
,
"
said
Tibbs
,
with
a
mouthful
of
bread
---
"
when
I
was
in
the
volunteer
corps
,
in
eighteen
hundred
and
six
,
our
commanding
officer
was
Sir
Charles
Rampart
;
and
one
day
,
when
we
were
exercising
on
the
ground
on
which
the
London
University
now
stands
,
he
says
,
says
he
,
Tibbs
(
calling
me
from
the
ranks
)
,
Tibbs
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
your
master
,
James
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Tibbs
,
in
an
awfully
distinct
tone
,
"
tell
your
master
if
he
<EOS>
WON'T
carve
those
fowls
,
to
send
them
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
discomfited
volunteer
instantly
set
to
work
,
and
carved
the
fowls
almost
as
expeditiously
as
his
wife
operated
on
the
haunch
of
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
ever
finished
the
story
is
not
known
<EOS>
but
,
if
he
did
,
nobody
heard
it
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
ice
was
now
broken
,
and
the
new
inmates
more
at
home
,
every
member
of
the
company
felt
more
at
ease
.
 
<EOS>
Tibbs
himself
most
certainly
did
,
because
he
went
to
sleep
immediately
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mr
Hicks
and
the
ladies
discoursed
most
eloquently
about
poetry
,
and
the
theatres
,
and
Lord
Chesterfield
's
Letters
;
and
Mr
Calton
followed
up
what
everybody
said
,
with
continuous
double
knocks
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
highly
approved
of
every
observation
that
fell
from
Mrs
Maplesone
;
and
as
Mr
Simpson
sat
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
and
said
"
Yes
,
"
or
"
Certainly
,
"
at
intervals
of
about
four
minutes
each
,
he
received
full
credit
for
understanding
what
was
going
forward
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
rejoined
the
ladies
in
the
drawing
-
room
very
shortly
after
they
had
left
the
dining
-
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Maplesone
and
Mr
Calton
played
cribbage
,
and
the
"
young
people
"
amused
themselves
with
music
and
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
The
Miss
Maplesones
sang
the
most
fascinating
duets
,
and
accompanied
themselves
on
guitars
,
ornamented
with
bits
of
ethereal
blue
ribbon
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Simpson
put
on
a
pink
waistcoat
,
and
said
he
was
in
raptures
;
and
Mr
Hicks
felt
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
poetry
or
the
seventh
canto
of
Don
Juan
---
it
was
the
same
thing
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
was
quite
charmed
with
the
newcomers
;
and
Mr
Tibbs
spent
the
evening
in
his
usual
way
<EOS>
---
he
went
to
sleep
,
and
woke
up
,
and
went
to
sleep
again
,
and
woke
at
supper
-
time
.
   
<EOS>
We
are
not
about
to
adopt
the
licence
of
novel
-
writers
,
and
to
let
"
years
roll
on
;
"
but
we
will
take
the
liberty
of
requesting
the
reader
to
suppose
that
six
months
have
elapsed
,
since
the
dinner
we
have
described
,
and
that
Mrs
Tibbs
's
boarders
have
,
during
that
period
,
sang
,
and
danced
,
and
gone
to
theatres
and
exhibitions
,
together
,
as
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
wherever
they
board
,
often
do
.
<EOS>
And
we
will
beg
them
,
the
period
we
have
mentioned
having
elapsed
,
to
imagine
farther
,
that
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
received
,
in
his
own
bedroom
(
a
front
attic
)
,
at
an
early
hour
one
morning
,
a
note
from
Mr
Calton
,
requesting
the
favour
of
seeing
him
,
as
soon
as
convenient
to
himself
,
in
his
(
Calton
's
)
dressing
-
room
on
the
second
-
floor
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
Mr
Calton
<EOS>
I
'll
come
down
directly
,
"
said
Mr
Septimus
to
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
---
is
Mr
Calton
unwell
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
this
excited
walker
of
hospitals
,
as
he
put
on
a
bed
-
furniture
-
looking
dressing
-
gown
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
as
I
knows
on
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Please
,
sir
,
he
looked
rather
rum
,
as
it
might
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
that
's
no
proof
of
his
being
ill
,
"
returned
Hicks
,
unconsciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
:
 
I
'll
be
down
directly
.
"
 
<EOS>
Downstairs
ran
the
boy
with
the
message
,
and
down
went
the
excited
Hicks
himself
,
almost
as
soon
as
the
message
was
delivered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tap
,
tap
.
"
<EOS>
"
Come
in
.
"
<EOS>
---
Door
opens
,
and
discovers
Mr
Calton
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Mutual
shakes
of
the
hand
exchanged
,
and
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
motioned
to
a
seat
.
 
<EOS>
A
short
pause
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hicks
coughed
,
and
Mr
Calton
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
interviews
where
neither
party
knows
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
broke
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
received
a
note
---
"
he
said
,
very
tremulously
,
in
a
voice
like
a
Punch
with
a
cold
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Exactly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
although
this
dialogue
must
have
been
satisfactory
,
both
gentlemen
felt
there
was
something
more
important
to
be
said
;
therefore
they
did
as
most
men
in
such
a
situation
would
have
done
---
they
looked
at
the
table
with
a
determined
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
The
conversation
had
been
opened
,
however
,
and
Mr
Calton
had
made
up
his
mind
to
continue
it
with
a
regular
double
knock
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
spoke
very
pompously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hicks
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
have
sent
for
you
,
in
consequence
of
certain
arrangements
which
are
pending
in
this
house
,
connected
with
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
a
marriage
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
Hicks
,
compared
with
whose
expression
of
countenance
,
Hamlet
's
,
when
he
sees
his
father
's
ghost
,
is
pleasing
and
composed
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
a
marriage
,
"
returned
the
knocker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sent
for
you
to
prove
the
great
confidence
I
can
repose
in
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
will
you
betray
me
?
"
<EOS>
eagerly
inquired
Hicks
,
who
in
his
alarm
had
even
forgotten
to
quote
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
betray
YOU
!
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
YOU
betray
ME
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
:
 
no
one
shall
know
,
to
my
dying
day
,
that
you
had
a
hand
in
the
business
,
"
responded
the
agitated
Hicks
,
with
an
inflamed
countenance
,
and
his
hair
standing
on
end
as
if
he
were
on
the
stool
of
an
electrifying
machine
in
full
operation
.
   
<EOS>
"
People
must
know
that
,
some
time
or
other
---
within
a
year
,
I
imagine
,
"
said
Mr
Calton
,
with
an
air
of
great
self
-
complacency
.
<EOS>
"
We
MAY
have
a
family
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
WE

<EOS>
That
wo

The

it

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
how
can
it
?
"
said
the
bewildered
Hicks
.
 
<EOS>
Calton
was
too
much
inwrapped
in
the
contemplation
of
his
happiness
to
see
the
equivoque
between
Hicks
and
himself
;
and
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Matilda
!
"
sighed
the
antique
beau
,
in
a
lack
-
a
-
daisical
voice
,
and
applying
his
right
hand
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
fourth
button
of
his
waistcoat
,
counting
from
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Matilda
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
Matilda
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Hicks
,
starting
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Matilda
Maplesone
,
"
responded
the
other
,
doing
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
marry
her
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
said
Hicks
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
false

rejoined
his
companion
:
 
<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
said
Hicks
,
falling
into
his
chair
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
marry
the
mother
,
and
I
the
daughter
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Most
extraordinary
circumstance
!
"
replied
Mr
Calton
,
"
and
rather
inconvenient
too
;
for
the
fact
is
,
that
owing
to
Matilda
's
wishing
to
keep
her
intention
secret
from
her
daughters
until
the
ceremony
had
taken
place
,
she
does
n't
like
applying
to
any
of
her
friends
to
give
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
entertain
an
objection
to
making
the
affair
known
to
my
acquaintance
just
now
;
and
the
consequence
is
,
that
I
sent
to
you
to
know
whether
you
'd
oblige
me
by
acting
as
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
most
happy
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Hicks
,
in
a
tone
of
condolence
;
"
but
,
you
see
,
I
shall
be
acting
as
bridegroom
.
<EOS>
One
character
is
frequently
a
consequence
of
the
other
;
but
it
is
not
usual
to
act
in
both
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
Simpson
<EOS>
---
I
have
no
doubt
he
'll
do
it
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
to
ask
him
,
"
replied
Calton
,
"
he
's
such
a
donkey
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
,
and
down
at
the
floor
;
at
last
an
idea
struck
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
the
man
of
the
house
,
Tibbs
,
be
the
father
,
"
he
suggested
;
and
then
he
quoted
,
as
peculiarly
applicable
to
Tibbs
and
the
pair
---
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
Powers
of
Heaven
!
<EOS>
what
dark
eyes
meets
she
there
?
'
<EOS>
Tis
---
'
<EOS>
tis
her
father
's
---
<EOS>
fixed
upon
the
pair
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
idea
has
struck
me
already
,
"
said
Mr
Calton
:
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
you
see
,
Matilda
,
for
what
reason
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
is
very
anxious
that
Mrs
Tibbs
should
know
nothing
about
it
,
till
it
's
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
natural
delicacy
,
after
all
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
the
best
-
natured
little
man
in
existence
,
if
you
manage
him
properly
,
"
said
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
not
to
mention
it
to
his
wife
,
and
assure
him
she
wo
n't
mind
it
,
and
he
'll
do
it
directly
.
 
<EOS>
My
marriage
is
to
be
a
secret
one
,
on
account
of
the
mother
and
MY
father
;
therefore
he
must
be
enjoined
to
secrecy
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
small
double
knock
,
like
a
presumptuous
single
one
,
was
that
instant
heard
at
the
street
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Tibbs
;
it
could
be
no
one
else
;
for
no
one
else
occupied
five
minutes
in
rubbing
his
shoes
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
out
to
pay
the
baker
's
bill
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tibbs
,
"
called
Mr
Calton
in
a
very
bland
tone
,
looking
over
the
banisters
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
replied
he
of
the
dirty
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
have
the
kindness
to
step
up
-
stairs
for
a
moment
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir
,
"
said
Tibbs
,
delighted
to
be
taken
notice
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
bedroom
-
door
was
carefully
closed
,
and
Tibbs
,
having
put
his
hat
on
the
floor
(
as
most
timid
men
do
)
,
and
been
accommodated
with
a
seat
,
looked
as
astounded
as
if
he
were
suddenly
summoned
before
the
familiars
of
the
Inquisition
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
rather
unpleasant
occurrence
,
Mr
Tibbs
,
"
said
Calton
,
in
a
very
portentous
manner
,
"
obliges
me
to
consult
you
,
and
to
beg
you
will
not
communicate
what
I
am
about
to
say
,
to
your
wife
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tibbs
acquiesced
,
wondering
in
his
own
mind
what
the
deuce
the
other
could
have
done
,
and
imagining
that
at
least
he
must
have
broken
the
best
decanters
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Calton
resumed
;
"
I
am
placed
,
Mr
Tibbs
,
in
rather
an
unpleasant
situation
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tibbs
looked
at
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
,
as
if
he
thought
Mr
H
's
being
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
his
fellow
-
boarder
might
constitute
the
unpleasantness
of
his
situation
;
but
as
he
did
not
exactly
know
what
to
say
,
he
merely
ejaculated
the
monosyllable
"
Lor
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
continued
the
knocker
,
"
let
me
beg
you
will
exhibit
no
manifestations
of
surprise
,
which
may
be
overheard
by
the
domestics
,
<EOS>
when
I
tell
you
---
command
your
feelings
of
astonishment
---
that
two
inmates
of
this
house
intend
to
be
married
to
-
morrow
morning
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
drew
back
his
chair
,
several
feet
,
to
perceive
the
effect
of
the
unlooked
-
for
announcement
.
   
<EOS>
If
Tibbs
had
rushed
from
the
room
,
staggered
down
-
stairs
,
and
fainted
in
the
passage
---
if
he
had
instantaneously
jumped
out
of
the
window
into
the
mews
behind
the
house
,
in
an
agony
of
surprise
---
his
behaviour
would
have
been
much
less
inexplicable
to
Mr
Calton
than
it
was
,
when
he
put
his
hands
into
his
inexpressible
-
pockets
,
and
said
with
a
half
-
chuckle
,
"
Just
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
surprised
,
Mr
Tibbs
?
"
inquired
Mr
Calton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
no
,
sir
,
"
returned
Tibbs
;
"
after
all
,
its
very
natural
.
<EOS>
When
two
young
people
get
together
,
you
know
---
"
   
"
Certainly
,
certainly
,
"
said
Calton
,
with
an
indescribable
air
of
self
-
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
it
's
at
all
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
affair
then
?
"
asked
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
,
who
had
watched
the
countenance
of
Tibbs
in
mute
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
replied
Tibbs
;
"
I
was
just
the
same
at
his
age
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
actually
smiled
when
he
said
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
devilish
<EOS>
well
I
must
carry
my
years
!
<EOS>
"
thought
the
delighted
old
beau
,
knowing
he
was
at
least
ten
years
older
than
Tibbs
at
that
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
to
come
to
the
point
at
once
,
"
he
continued
,
"
I
have
to
ask
you
whether
you
will
object
to
act
as
father
on
the
occasion
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Tibbs
;
still
without
evincing
an
atom
of
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
not
,
"
reiterated
Tibbs
,
still
as
calm
as
a
pot
of
porter
with
the
head
off
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Calton
seized
the
hand
of
the
petticoat
-
governed
little
man
,
and
vowed
eternal
friendship
from
that
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Hicks
,
who
was
all
admiration
and
surprise
,
did
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
confess
,
"
asked
Mr
Calton
of
Tibbs
,
as
he
picked
up
his
hat
,
"
were
you
not
a
little
surprised
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
b'lieve
you
!
"
<EOS>
replied
that
illustrious
person
,
holding
up
one
hand
;
"
I
b'lieve
you
!
 
<EOS>
When
I
first
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
sudden
,
"
said
Septimus
Hicks
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
strange
to
ask
ME
,
you
know
,
"
said
Tibbs
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
odd
altogether
!
"
said
the
superannuated
love
-
maker
;
and
then
all
three
laughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
Tibbs
,
shutting
the
door
which
he
had
previously
opened
,
and
giving
full
vent
to
a
hitherto
corked
-
up
giggle
,
"
what
bothers
me
is
,
what
WILL
his
father
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
looked
at
Mr
Calton
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
the
best
of
it
is
,
"
said
the
latter
,
giggling
in
his
turn
,
"
I
have
n't
got
a
father
---
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
got
a
father
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
<EOS>
but
HE
has
,
"
said
Tibbs
.
   
<EOS>
"
WHO
has
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Septimus
Hicks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
HIM
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Him
,
who
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
my
secret
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
!
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
you
know
who
I
mean
,
"
returned
Tibbs
with
a
knowing
wink
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
whom
do
you
mean
?
"
inquired
Mr
Calton
,
who
,
like
Septimus
Hicks
,
was
all
but
out
of
his
senses
at
the
strange
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
Mr
Simpson
,
of
course
,
"
replied
Tibbs
;
"
who
else
could
I
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
all
,
"
said
the
Byron
-
quoter
;
"
Simpson
marries
Julia
Maplesone
to
-
morrow
morning
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Tibbs
,
thoroughly
satisfied
,
"
of
course
he
does
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
require
the
pencil
of
Hogarth
to
illustrate
---
our
feeble
pen
is
inadequate
to
describe
---
the
expression
which
the
countenances
of
Mr
Calton
and
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
respectively
assumed
,
at
this
unexpected
announcement
.
 
<EOS>
Equally
impossible
is
it
to
describe
,
although
perhaps
it
is
easier
for
our
lady
readers
to
imagine
,
what
arts
the
three
ladies
could
have
used
,
so
completely
to
entangle
their
separate
partners
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
they
were
,
however
,
they
were
successful
.
 
<EOS>
The
mother
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
intended
marriage
of
both
daughters
;
and
the
young
ladies
were
equally
acquainted
with
the
intention
of
their
estimable
parent
.
<EOS>
They
agreed
,
however
,
that
it
would
have
a
much
better
appearance
if
each
feigned
ignorance
of
the
other
's
engagement
;
and
it
was
equally
desirable
that
all
the
marriages
should
take
place
on
the
same
day
,
to
prevent
the
discovery
of
one
clandestine
alliance
,
operating
prejudicially
on
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
the
mystification
of
Mr
Calton
and
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
,
and
the
pre
-
engagement
of
the
unwary
Tibbs
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
was
united
to
Miss
Matilda
Maplesone
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Simpson
also
entered
into
a
"
holy
alliance
"
with
Miss
Julia
;
Tibbs
acting
as
father
,
"
his
first
appearance
in
that
character
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Calton
,
not
being
quite
so
eager
as
the
two
young
men
,
was
rather
struck
by
the
double
discovery
;
and
as
he
had
found
some
difficulty
in
getting
any
one
to
give
the
lady
away
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
best
mode
of
obviating
the
inconvenience
would
be
not
to
take
her
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
,
however
,
"
appealed
,
"
as
her
counsel
said
on
the
trial
of
the
cause
,
MAPLESONE
v
CALTON
,
for
a
breach
of
promise
,
"
with
a
broken
heart
,
to
the
outraged
laws
of
her
country
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
recovered
damages
to
the
amount
of
1,000L.
which
the
unfortunate
knocker
was
compelled
to
pay
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
having
walked
the
hospitals
,
took
it
into
his
head
to
walk
off
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
His
injured
wife
is
at
present
residing
with
her
mother
at
Boulogne
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Simpson
,
having
the
misfortune
to
lose
his
wife
six
weeks
after
marriage
(
by
her
eloping
with
an
officer
during
his
temporary
sojourn
in
the
Fleet
Prison
,
in
consequence
of
his
inability
to
discharge
her
little
mantua
-
maker
's
bill
)
,
and
being
disinherited
by
his
father
,
who
died
soon
afterwards
,
was
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
permanent
engagement
at
a
fashionable
haircutter
's
;
hairdressing
being
a
science
to
which
he
had
frequently
directed
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
situation
he
had
necessarily
many
opportunities
of
making
himself
acquainted
with
the
habits
,
and
style
of
thinking
,
of
the
exclusive
portion
of
the
nobility
of
this
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
fortunate
circumstance
are
we
indebted
for
the
production
of
those
brilliant
efforts
of
genius
,
his
fashionable
novels
,
which
so
long
as
good
taste
,
unsullied
by
exaggeration
,
ca
nt
,
and
quackery
,
continues
to
exist
,
can
not
fail
to
instruct
and
amuse
the
thinking
portion
of
the
community
.
   
<EOS>
It
only
remains
to
add
,
that
this
complication
of
disorders
completely
deprived
poor
Mrs
Tibbs
of
all
her
inmates
,
except
the
one
whom
she
could
have
best
spared
---
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
That
wretched
little
man
returned
home
,
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
,
in
a
state
of
partial
intoxication
;
and
,
under
the
influence
of
wine
,
excitement
,
and
despair
,
actually
dared
to
brave
the
anger
of
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Since
that
ill
-
fated
hour
he
has
constantly
taken
his
meals
in
the
kitchen
,
to
which
apartment
,
it
is
understood
,
his
witticisms
will
be
in
future
confined
:
 
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
having
been
conveyed
there
by
Mrs
Tibbs
's
order
for
his
exclusive
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
possible
that
he
will
be
enabled
to
finish
,
in
that
seclusion
,
his
story
of
the
volunteers
.

"
<EOS>
Well

"
said
little
Mrs
Tibbs
to
herself
,
as
she
sat
in
the
front
parlour
of
the
Coram
-
street
mansion
one
morning
,
mending
a
piece
of
stair

carpet
off
the

"

either
,
and
if
I
only
get

favourable
answer
to

we
shall

again

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
resumed
her
occupation
of
making
worsted
lattice
-
work
in
the
carpet
,
anxiously
listening
to
the
twopenny
postman
,
who
was
hammering
his
way
down
the
street
,
at
the
rate
of
a
penny
a
knock
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
as
quiet
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
low
sound
to
be
heard
---
it
was
the
unhappy
Tibbs
cleaning
the
gentlemen
's
boots
in
the
back
kitchen
,
and
accompanying
himself
with
a
buzzing
noise
,
in
wretched
mockery
of
humming
a
tune
.
   
<EOS>
The
postman
drew
near
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
---
so
did
Mrs
Tibbs
.
 
<EOS>
A
knock
---
a
bustle
---
a
letter

Little
Mrs
Tibbs
perused
the
document
,
over
and
over
again
;
and
the
more
she
read
it
,
the
more
was
she
confused
by
the
mixture
of
the
first
and
third
person
;
the
substitution
of
the
"
i
"
for
the
"
T*I
;
"
and
the
transition
from
the
"
I*T%
"
to
the
"
You
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
writing
looked
like
a
skein
of
thread
in
a
tangle
,
and
the
note
was
ingeniously
folded
into
a
perfect
square
,
with
the
direction
squeezed
up
into
the
right
-
hand
corner
,
as
if
it
were
ashamed
of
itself
.
 
<EOS>
The
back
of
the
epistle
was
pleasingly
ornamented
with
a
large
red
wafer
,
which
,
with
the
addition
of
divers
ink
-
stains
,
bore
a
marvellous
resemblance
to
a
black
beetle
trodden
upon
.
 
<EOS>
One
thing
,
however
,
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
perplexed
Mrs
Tibbs
.
<EOS>
Somebody
was
to
call
at
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
The
drawing
-
room
was
forthwith
dusted
for
the
third
time
that
morning
;
three
or
four
chairs
were
pulled
out
of
their
places
,
and
a
corresponding
number
of
books
carefully
upset
,
in
order
that
there
might
be
a
due
absence
of
formality
.
 
<EOS>
Down
went
the
piece
of
stair
-
carpet
before
noticed
,
and
up
ran
Mrs
Tibbs
"
to
make
herself
tidy
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
clock
of
New
Saint
Pancras
Church
struck
twelve
,
and
the
Foundling
,
with
laudable
politeness
,
did
the
same
ten
minutes
afterwards
,
Saint
something
else
struck
the
quarter
,
and
then
there
arrived
a
single
lady
with
a
double
knock
,
in
a
pelisse
<EOS>
the
colour
of
the
interior
of
a
damson
pie
;
a
bonnet
of
the
same
,
with
a
regular
conservatory
of
artificial
flowers
;
a
white
veil
,
and
a
green
parasol
,
with
a
cobweb
border
.
   
<EOS>
The
visitor
(
who
was
very
fat
and
red
-
faced
)
was
shown
into
the
drawing
-
room
;
Mrs
Tibbs
presented
herself
,
and
the
negotiation
commenced
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
called
in
consequence
of
an
advertisement
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
in
a
voice
as
if
she
had
been
playing
a
set
of
Pan
's
pipes
for
a
fortnight
without
leaving
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
rubbing
her
hands
very
slowly
,
and
looking
the
applicant
full
in
the
face
---
<EOS>
two
things
she
always
did
on
such
occasions
.
   
<EOS>
"
Money
is
n't
no
object
<EOS>
whatever
to
me
,
"
said
the
lady
,
"
so
much
as
living
in
a
state
of
retirement
and
obtrusion
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
acquiesced
in
such
an
exceedingly
natural
desire
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
constantly
attended
by
a
medical
man
,
"
resumed
the
pelisse
wearer
;
"
I
have
been
a
shocking
unitarian
for
some
time
---
<EOS>
I
,
indeed
,
have
had
very
little
peace
since
the
death
of
Mr
Bloss
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
looked
at
the
relict
of
the
departed
Bloss
,
and
thought
he
must
have
had
very
little
peace
in
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
she
could
not
say
so
;
so
she
looked
very
sympathising
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
a
good
deal
of
trouble
to
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
;
"
but
,
for
that
trouble
I
am
willing
to
pay
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
through
a
course
of
treatment
which
renders
attention
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
one
mutton
-
chop
in
bed
at
half
-
past
eight
,
and
another
at
ten
,
every
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
expressed
the
pity
she
felt
for
anybody
placed
in
such
a
distressing
situation
;
and
the
carnivorous
Mrs
Bloss
proceeded
to
arrange
the
various
preliminaries
with
wonderful
despatch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
mind
,
"
said
that
lady
,
after
terms
were
arranged
;
"
I
am
to
have
the
second
-
floor
front
,
for
my
bed
-
room
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
find
room
for
my
little
servant
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
can
have
one
of
the
cellars
in
the
area
for
my
bottled
porter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
greatest
pleasure
;
---
James
shall
get
it
ready
for
you
by
Saturday
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'll
join
the
company
at
the
breakfast
-
table
on
Sunday
morning
,
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
get
up
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
returned
Mrs
Tibbs
,
in
her
most
amiable
tone
;
for
satisfactory
references
had
"
been
given
and
required
,
"
and
it
was
quite
certain
that
the
new
-
comer
had
plenty
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
rather
singular
,
"
continued
Mrs
Tibbs
,
with
what
was
meant
for
a
most
bewitching
smile
,
"
that
we
have
a
gentleman
now
with
us
,
who
is
in
a
very
delicate
state
of
health
---
a
Mr
Gobler
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
His
apartment
is
the
back
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
next
room
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mrs
Bloss
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
next
room
,
"
repeated
the
hostess
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
very
promiscuous
!
"
ejaculated
the
widow
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
hardly
ever
gets
up
,
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
"
cried
Mrs
Bloss
,
in
an
equally
low
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
he
is
up
,
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
"
we
never
can
persuade
him
to
go
to
bed
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
the
astonished
Mrs
Bloss
,
drawing
her
chair
nearer
Mrs
Tibbs
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
his
complaint
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
"
replied
Mrs
Tibbs
,
with
a
most
communicative
air
,
"
he
has
no
stomach
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
what
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs
Bloss
,
with
a
look
of
the
most
indescribable
alarm
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
stomach
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Tibbs
,
with
a
shake
of
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
us
!
<EOS>
what
an
extraordinary
case
!
"
gasped
Mrs
Bloss
,
as
if
she
understood
the
communication
in
its
literal
sense
,
and
was
astonished
at
a
gentleman
without
a
stomach
finding
it
necessary
to
board
anywhere
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
say
he
has
no
stomach
,
"
explained
the
chatty
little
Mrs
Tibbs
,
"
I
mean
that
his
digestion
is
so
much
impaired
,
and
his
interior
so
deranged
,
that
his
stomach
is
not
of
the
least
use
to
him
;
---
in
fact
,
it
's
an
inconvenience
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
heard
such
a
case
in
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs
Bloss
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
's
worse
than
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
"
replied
Mrs
Tibbs
;
---
"
certainly
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
said
this
with
great
confidence
,
for
the
damson
pelisse
suggested
that
Mrs
Bloss
,
at
all
events
,
was
not
suffering
under
Mr
Gobler
's
complaint
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
quite
incited
my
curiosity
,
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
,
as
she
rose
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
I
long
to
see
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
generally
comes
down
,
once
a
week
,
"
replied
Mrs
Tibbs
;
"
I
dare
say
you
'll
see
him
on
Sunday
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
consolatory
promise
Mrs
Bloss
was
obliged
to
be
contented
.
 
<EOS>
She
accordingly
walked
slowly
down
the
stairs
,
detailing
her
complaints
all
the
way
;
and
Mrs
Tibbs
followed
her
,
uttering
an
exclamation
of
compassion
at
every
step
.
 
<EOS>
James
(
who
looked
very
gritty
,
for
he
was
cleaning
the
knives
)
fell
up
the
kitchen
-
stairs
,
and
opened
the
street
-
door
;
and
,
after
mutual
farewells
,
Mrs
Bloss
slowly
departed
,
down
the
shady
side
of
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
almost
superfluous
to
say
,
that
the
lady
whom
we
have
just
shown
out
at
the
street
-
door
(
and
whom
the
two
female
servants
are
now
inspecting
from
the
second
-
floor
windows
)
was
exceedingly
vulgar
,
ignorant
,
and
selfish
.
 
<EOS>
Her
deceased
better
-
half
had
been
an
eminent
cork
-
cutter
,
in
which
capacity
he
had
amassed
a
decent
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
relative
but
his
nephew
,
and
no
friend
but
his
cook
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
had
the
insolence
one
morning
to
ask
for
the
loan
of
fifteen
pounds
;
and
,
by
way
of
retaliation
,
he
married
the
latter
next
day
;
he
made
a
will
immediately
afterwards
,
containing
a
burst
of
honest
indignation
against
his
nephew
(
who
supported
himself
and
two
sisters
on
100L.
a
year
)
,
and
a
bequest
of
his
whole
property
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
ill
after
breakfast
,
and
died
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
mantelpiece
-
looking
tablet
in
a
civic
parish
church
,
setting
forth
his
virtues
,
and
deploring
his
loss
.
<EOS>
He
never
dishonoured
a
bill
,
or
gave
away
a
halfpenny
.
   
<EOS>
The
relict
and
sole
executrix
of
this
noble
-
minded
man
was
an
odd
mixture
of
shrewdness
and
simplicity
,
liberality
and
meanness
.
<EOS>
Bred
up
as
she
had
been
,
she
knew
no
mode
of
living
so
agreeable
as
a
boarding
-
house
:
 
and
having
nothing
to
do
,
and
nothing
to
wish
for
<EOS>
,
she
naturally
imagined
she
must
be
ill
---
an
impression
which
was
most
assiduously
promoted
by
her
medical
attendant
,
Dr
Wosky
,
and
her
handmaid
Agnes
:
 
both
of
whom
,
doubtless
for
good
reasons
,
encouraged
all
her
extravagant
notions
.
   
<EOS>
Since
the
catastrophe
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
,
Mrs
Tibbs
had
been
very
shy
of
young
-
lady
boarders
.
 
<EOS>
Her
present
inmates
were
all
lords
of
the
creation
,
and
she
availed
herself
of
the
opportunity
of
their
assemblage
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
to
announce
the
expected
arrival
of
Mrs
Bloss
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
received
the
communication
with
stoical
indifference
,
and
Mrs
Tibbs
devoted
all
her
energies
to
prepare
for
the
reception
of
the
valetudinarian
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
-
floor
front
was
scrubbed
,
and
washed
,
and
flannelled
,
till
the
wet
went
through
to
the
drawing
-
room
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
Clean
white
counterpanes
,
and
curtains
,
and
napkins
,
water
-
bottles
as
clear
as
crystal
,
blue
jugs
,
and
mahogany
furniture
,
added
to
the
splendour
,
and
increased
the
comfort
,
of
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
The
warming
-
pan
was
in
constant
requisition
,
and
a
fire
lighted
in
the
room
every
day
.
<EOS>
The
chattels
of
Mrs
Bloss
were
forwarded
by
instalments
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
there
came
a
large
hamper
of
Guinness
's
stout
,
and
an
umbrella
;
then
,
a
train
of
trunks
;
then
,
a
pair
of
clogs
and
a
bandbox
;
then
,
an
easy
chair
with
an
air
-
cushion
;
then
,
a
variety
of
suspicious
-
looking
packages
;
and
---
"
though
last
not
least
"
---
Mrs
Bloss
and
Agnes
:
 
the
latter
in
a
cherry
-
coloured
merino
dress
,
open
-
work
stockings
,
and
shoes
with
sandals
:
 
like
a
disguised
Columbine
.
   
<EOS>
The
installation
of
the
Duke
of
Wellington
,
as
Chancellor
of
the
University
of
Oxford
,
was
nothing
,
in
point
of
bustle
and
turmoil
,
to
the
installation
of
Mrs
Bloss
in
her
new
quarters
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
there
was
no
bright
doctor
of
civil
law
to
deliver
a
classical
address
on
the
occasion
;
but
there
were
several
other
old
women
present
,
who
spoke
quite
as
much
to
the
purpose
,
and
understood
themselves
equally
well
.
 
<EOS>
The
chop
-
eater
was
so
fatigued
with
the
process
of
removal
that
she
declined
leaving
her
room
until
the
following
morning
;
so
a
mutton
-
chop
,
pickle
,
a
pill
,
a
pint
bottle
of
stout
,
and
other
medicines
,
were
carried
up
-
stairs
for
her
consumption
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
DO
you
think
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
inquisitive
Agnes
of
her
mistress
,
after
they
had
been
in
the
house
some
three
hours
;
"
what
DO
you
think
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
the
lady
of
the
house
is
married
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Married
!
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
,
taking
the
pill
and
a
draught
of
Guinness
---
"
married
!
 
<EOS>
Unpossible
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
indeed
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
the
Columbine
;
"
and
her
husband
,
ma'am
,
lives

<EOS>
In

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

ma'am

<EOS>
and
he

<EOS>
he

<EOS>
he
---
the
housemaid
says
,
he
never
goes
into
the
parlour
except
on
Sundays
;
and
that
Ms.
Tibbs
makes
him
clean
the
gentlemen
's
boots
;
and
that
he
cleans
the
windows
,
too
,
sometimes
;
and
that
one
morning
early
,
when
he
was
in
the
front
balcony
cleaning
the
drawing
-
room
windows
,
he
called
out
to
a
gentleman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
who
used
to
live
here
---
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Calton
,
<EOS>
sir
,
how
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
 
Here
the
attendant
laughed
till
Mrs
Bloss
was
in
serious
apprehension
of
her
chuckling
herself
into
a
fit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
never
!
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
And
please
,
ma'am
,
the
servants
gives
him
gin
-
and
-
water
sometimes
;
and
then
he
cries
,
and
says
he
hates
his
wife
and
the
boarders
,
and
wants
to
tickle
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tickle
the
boarders
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs
Bloss
,
seriously
alarmed
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
,
not
<EOS>
the
boarders
,
the
servants
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
is
that
all
!
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
,
quite
satisfied
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
wanted
to
kiss
me
as
I
came
up
the
kitchen
-
stairs
,
just
now
,
"
said
Agnes
,
indignantly
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
gave
it
him
---
a
little
wretch
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
intelligence
was
but
too
true
.
 
<EOS>
A
long
course
of
snubbing
and
neglect
;
his
days
spent
in
the
kitchen
,
and
his
nights
in
the
turn
-
up
bedstead
,
had
completely
broken
the
little
spirit
that
the
unfortunate
volunteer
had
ever
possessed
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
one
to
whom
he
could
detail
his
injuries
but
the
servants
,
and
they
were
almost
of
necessity
his
chosen
confidants
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
less
strange
than
true
,
however
,
that
the
little
weaknesses
which
he
had
incurred
,
most
probably
during
his
military
career
,
seemed
to
increase
as
his
comforts
diminished
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
actually
a
sort
of
journeyman
Giovanni
of
the
basement
story
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
being
Sunday
,
breakfast
was
laid
in
the
front
parlour
at
ten
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Nine
was
the
usual
time
,
but
the
family
always
breakfasted
an
hour
later
on
sabbath
.
 
<EOS>
Tibbs
enrobed
himself
in
his
Sunday
costume
---
a
black
coat
,
and
exceedingly
short
,
thin
trousers
;
with
a
very
large
white
waistcoat
,
white
stockings
and
cravat
,
and
Blucher
boots
---
and
mounted
to
the
parlour
aforesaid
.
<EOS>
Nobody
had
come
down
,
and
he
amused
himself
by
drinking
the
contents
of
the
milkpot
with
a
teaspoon
.
   
<EOS>
A
pair
of
slippers
were
heard
descending
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Tibbs
flew
to
a
chair
;
and
a
stern
-
looking
man
,
of
about
fifty
,
with
very
little
hair
on
his
head
,
and
a
Sunday
paper
in
his
hand
,
entered
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
morning
,
Mr
Evenson
,
"
said
Tibbs
,
very
humbly
,
with
something
between
a
nod
and
a
bow
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Tibbs
?
<EOS>
"
replied
he
of
the
slippers
,
as
he
sat
himself
down
,
and
began
to
read
his
paper
without
saying
another
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Wisbottle
in
town
to
-
day
,
do
you
know
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tibbs
,
just
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
he
was
,
"
replied
the
stern
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
whistling
"
The
Light
Guitar
,
"
in
the
next
room
to
mine
,
at
five
o'clock
this
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
very
fond
of
whistling
,
"
said
Tibbs
,
with
a
slight
smirk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
---
I
ai
n't
,
"
was
the
laconic
reply
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
John
Evenson
was
in
the
receipt
of
an
independent
income
,
arising
chiefly
from
various
houses
he
owned
in
the
different
suburbs
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
morose
and
discontented
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
thorough
radical
,
and
used
to
attend
a
great
variety
of
public
meetings
,
for
the
express
purpose
of
finding
fault
with
everything
that
was
proposed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wisbottle
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
a
high
Tory
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
clerk
in
the
Woods
and
Forests
Office
,
which
he
considered
rather
an
aristocratic
employment
;
he
knew
the
peerage
by
heart
,
and
,
could
tell
you
,
off
-
hand
,
where
any
illustrious
personage
lived
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
good
set
of
teeth
,
and
a
capital
tailor
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Evenson
looked
on
all
these
qualifications
with
profound
contempt
;
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
two
were
always
disputing
,
much
to
the
edification
of
the
rest
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
be
added
,
that
,
in
addition
to
his
partiality
for
whistling
,
Mr
Wisbottle
had
a
great
idea
of
his
singing
powers
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
other
boarders
,
besides
the
gentleman
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
---
Mr
Alfred
Tomkins
and
Mr
Frederick
O'Bleary
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tomkins
was
a
clerk
in
a
wine
-
house
;
he
was
a
connoisseur
in
paintings
,
and
had
a
wonderful
eye
for
the
picturesque
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
O'Bleary
was
an
Irishman
,
recently
imported
;
he
was
in
a
perfectly
wild
state
;
and
had
come
over
to
England
to
be
an
apothecary
,
a
clerk
in
a
government
office
,
an
actor
,
a
reporter
,
or
anything
else
that
turned
up
---
he
was
not
particular
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
familiar
terms
with
two
small
Irish
members
,
and
got
franks
for
everybody
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
convinced
that
his
intrinsic
merits
must
procure
him
a
high
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
shepherd's
-
plaid
inexpressibles
,
and
used
to
look
under
all
the
ladies
'
bonnets
as
he
walked
along
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
His
manners
and
appearance
reminded
one
of
Orson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
comes
Mr
Wisbottle
,
"
said
Tibbs
;
and
Mr
Wisbottle
forthwith
appeared
in
blue
slippers
,
and
a
shawl
dressing
-
gown
,
whistling
"
DI
PIACER
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
,
sir
,
"
said
Tibbs
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
almost
the
only
thing
he
ever
said
to
anybody
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
Tibbs
?
"
<EOS>
condescendingly
replied
the
amateur
;
and
he
walked
to
the
window
,
and
whistled
louder
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
air
,
that
!
"
said
Evenson
,
with
a
snarl
,
and
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Glad
you
like
it
,
"
replied
Wisbottle
,
highly
gratified
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
it
would
sound
better
,
if
you
whistled
it
a
little
louder
?
"
inquired
the
mastiff
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
I
do
n't
think
it
would
,
"
rejoined
the
unconscious
Wisbottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Wisbottle
,
"
said
Evenson
,
who
had
been
bottling
up
his
anger
for
some
hours
---
"
<EOS>
the
next
time
you
feel
disposed
to
whistle
"
The
Light
Guitar
"
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
I
'll
trouble
you
to
whistle
it
with
your
head
out
o
'
window
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
,
I
'll
learn
the
triangle
---
<EOS>
I
will
,
by
---
"
   
The
entrance
of
Mrs
Tibbs
(
with
the
keys
in
a
little
basket
)
<EOS>
interrupted
the
threat
,
and
prevented
its
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
apologised
for
being
down
rather
late
;
the
bell
was
rung
;
James
brought
up
the
urn
,
and
received
an
unlimited
order
for
dry
toast
and
bacon
.
 
<EOS>
Tibbs
sat
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
and
began
eating
water
-
cresses
like
a
Nebuchadnezzar
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
O'Bleary
appeared
,
and
Mr
Alfred
Tomkins
.
 
<EOS>
The
compliments
of
the
morning
were
exchanged
,
and
the
tea
was
made
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Tomkins
,
who
had
been
looking
out
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
<EOS>
---
Wisbottle
---
pray
come
here
---
make
haste
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wisbottle
started
from
the
table
,
and
every
one
looked
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
,
"
said
the
connoisseur
,
placing
Wisbottle
in
the
right
position
---
"
a
little
more
this
way
:
 
there
---
<EOS>
do
you
see
how
splendidly
the
light
falls
upon
the
left
side
of
that
broken
chimney
-
pot
at
No
.
48
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
"
replied
Wisbottle
,
in
a
tone
of
admiration
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
an
object
stand
out
so
beautifully
against
the
clear
sky
in
my
life
,
"
ejaculated
Alfred
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
(
except
John
Evenson
)
echoed
the
sentiment
;
for
Mr
Tomkins
had
a
great
character
for
finding
out
beauties
which
no
one
else
could
discover
---
he
certainly
deserved
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
frequently
observed
a
chimney
-
pot
in
College
-
green
,
Dublin
,
which
has
a
much
better
effect
,
"
said
the
patriotic
O'Bleary
,
who
never
allowed
Ireland
to
be
outdone
on
any
point
.
   
<EOS>
The
assertion
was
received
with
obvious
incredulity
,
for
Mr
Tomkins
declared
that
no
other
chimney
-
pot
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
broken
or
unbroken
,
could
be
so
beautiful
as
the
one
at
No
.
48
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
-
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
,
and
Agnes
appeared
,
leading
in
Mrs
Bloss
,
who
was
dressed
in
a
geranium
-
coloured
muslin
gown
,
and
displayed
a
gold
watch
of
huge
dimensions
;
a
chain
to
match
;
and
a
splendid
assortment
of
rings
,
with
enormous
stones
.
 
<EOS>
A
general
rush
was
made
for
a
chair
,
and
a
regular
introduction
took
place
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
John
Evenson
made
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
;
Mr
Frederick
O'Bleary
,
Mr
Alfred
Tomkins
,
and
Mr
Wisbottle
,
bowed
like
the
mandarins
in
a
grocer
's
shop
;
Tibbs
rubbed
hands
,
and
went
round
in
circles
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
observed
to
close
one
eye
,
and
to
assume
a
clock
-
work
sort
of
expression
with
the
other
;
this
has
been
considered
as
a
wink
,
and
it
has
been
reported
that
Agnes
was
its
object
.
 
<EOS>
We
repel
the
calumny
,
and
challenge
contradiction
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
inquired
after
Mrs
Bloss
's
health
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bloss
,
with
a
supreme
contempt
for
the
memory
of
Lindley
Murray
,
answered
the
various
questions
in
a
most
satisfactory
manner
;
and
a
pause
ensued
,
during
which
the
eatables
disappeared
with
awful
rapidity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
been
very
much
pleased
with
the
appearance
of
the
ladies
going
to
the
Drawing
-
room
the
other
day
,
Mr
O'Bleary
?
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
hoping
to
start
a
topic
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Orson
,
with
a
mouthful
of
toast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
saw
anything
like
it
before
,
I
suppose
?
"
suggested
Wisbottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
---
except
the
Lord
Lieutenant
's
levees
,
"
replied
O'Bleary
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
at
all
equal
to
our
drawing
-
rooms
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
infinitely
superior
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gad
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
the
aristocratic
Wisbottle
,
"
the
Dowager
Marchioness
of
Publiccash
was
most
magnificently
dressed
,
and
so
was
the
Baron
Slappenbachenhausen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
he
presented
on
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Evenson
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
his
arrival
in
England
.
"
   
"
I
thought
so
,
"
growled
the
radical
;
"
you
never
hear
of
these
fellows
being
presented
on
their
going
away
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unless
somebody
pervades
them
with
an
apintment
,
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
,
joining
in
the
conversation
in
a
faint
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Wisbottle
,
evading
the
point
,
"
it
's
a
splendid
sight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
did
it
never
occur
to
you
,
"
inquired
the
radical
,
who
never
would
be
quiet
;
"
did
it
never
occur
to
you
,
that
you
pay
for
these
precious
ornaments
of
society
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
HAS
occurred
to
me
,
"
said
Wisbottle
,
who
thought
this
answer
was
a
poser
;
"
it
HAS
occurred
to
me
,
and
I
am
willing
to
pay
for
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
too
,
"
replied
John
Evenson
,
"
and
I
ai
n't
willing
to
pay
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Then
why
should
I
?
<EOS>
---
I
say
,
why
should
I
?
"
<EOS>
continued
the
politician
,
laying
down
the
paper
,
and
knocking
his
knuckles
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
two
great
principles
---
demand
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
A
cup
of
tea
if
you
please
,
dear
,
"
interrupted
Tibbs
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
supply
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
trouble
you
to
hand
this
tea
to
Mr
Tibbs
?
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
interrupting
the
argument
,
and
unconsciously
illustrating
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
thread
of
the
orator
's
discourse
was
broken
.
 
<EOS>
He
drank
his
tea
and
resumed
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
very
fine
,
"
said
Mr
Alfred
Tomkins
,
addressing
the
company
in
general
,
"
I
shall
ride
down
to
Richmond
to
-
day
,
and
come
back
by
the
steamer
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
some
splendid
effects
of
light
and
shade
on
the
Thames
;
the
contrast
between
the
blueness
of
the
sky
and
the
yellow
water
is
frequently
exceedingly
beautiful
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wisbottle
hummed
,
"
Flow
on
,
thou
shining
river
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
some
splendid
steam
-
vessels
in
Ireland
,
"
said
O'Bleary
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
,
delighted
to
find
a
subject
broached
in
which
she
could
take
part
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
accommodations
are
extraordinary
,
"
said
O'Bleary
.
   
<EOS>
"
Extraordinary
indeed
,
"
returned
Mrs
Bloss
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
Mr
Bloss
was
alive
,
he
was
promiscuously
obligated
to
go
to
Ireland
on
business
.
<EOS>
I
went
with
him
,
and
raly
the
manner
in
which
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
accommodated
with
berths
,
is
not
creditable
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tibbs
,
who
had
been
listening
to
the
dialogue
,
looked
aghast
,
and
evinced
a
strong
inclination
to
ask
a
question
,
but
was
checked
by
a
look
from
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wisbottle
laughed
,
and
said
Tomkins
had
made
a
pun
;
and
Tomkins
laughed
too
,
and
said
he
had
not
.
   
<EOS>
The
remainder
of
the
meal
passed
off
as
breakfasts
usually
do
.
<EOS>
Conversation
flagged
,
and
people
played
with
their
teaspoons
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
looked
out
at
the
window
;
walked
about
the
room
;
and
,
when
they
got
near
the
door
,
dropped
off
one
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
Tibbs
retired
to
the
back
parlour
by
his
wife
's
orders
,
to
check
the
green
-
grocer
's
weekly
account
;
and
ultimately
Mrs
Tibbs
and
Mrs
Bloss
were
left
alone
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
!
"
said
the
latter
,
"
I
feel
alarmingly
faint
;
it
's
very
singular
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
It
certainly
was
,
for
she
had
eaten
four
pounds
of
solids
that
morning
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
bye
,
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
,
"
I
have
not
seen
Mr
What's
-
his
-
name
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gobler
?
"
suggested
Mrs
Tibbs
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
"
he
is
a
most
mysterious
person
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
his
meals
regularly
sent
up
-
stairs
,
and
sometimes
do
n't
leave
his
room
for
weeks
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
seen
or
heard
nothing
of
him
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Bloss
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
'll
hear
him
to
-
night
,
"
replied
Mrs
Tibbs
;
"
he
generally
groans
a
good
deal
on
Sunday
evenings
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
felt
such
an
interest
in
any
one
in
my
life
,
"
ejaculated
Mrs
Bloss
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
double
-
knock
interrupted
the
conversation
;
Dr
Wosky
was
announced
,
and
duly
shown
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
man
with
a
red
face
---
dressed
of
course
in
black
,
with
a
stiff
white
neckerchief
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
very
good
practice
,
and
plenty
of
money
,
which
he
had
amassed
by
invariably
humouring
the
worst
fancies
of
all
the
females
of
all
the
families
he
had
ever
been
introduced
into
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
offered
to
retire
,
but
was
entreated
to
stay
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
and
how
are
we
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Wosky
,
in
a
soothing
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
ill
,
doctor
---
very
ill
,
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
,
in
a
whisper
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
we
must
take
care
of
ourselves
;
---
we
must
,
indeed
,
"
said
the
obsequious
Wosky
,
as
he
felt
the
pulse
of
his
interesting
patient
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
our
appetite
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Bloss
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
requires
great
care
,
"
said
Wosky
,
appealing
to
Mrs
Tibbs
,
who
of
course
assented
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
however
,
with
the
blessing
of
Providence
,
that
we
shall
be
enabled
to
make
her
quite
stout
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
wondered
in
her
own
mind
what
the
patient
would
be
when
she
was
made
quite
stout
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
take
stimulants
,
"
said
the
cunning
Wosky
---
"
plenty
of
nourishment
,
and
,
above
all
,
we
must
keep
our
nerves
quiet
;
we
positively
must
not
give
way
to
our
sensibilities
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
take
all
we
can
get
,
"
concluded
the
doctor
,
as
he
pocketed
his
fee
,
"
and
we
must
keep
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
man
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Bloss
,
as
the
doctor
stepped
into
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charming
creature
indeed
---
quite
a
lady
's
man
!
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
and
Dr
Wosky
rattled
away
to
make
fresh
gulls
of
delicate
females
,
and
pocket
fresh
fees
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
had
occasion
,
in
a
former
paper
,
to
describe
a
dinner
at
Mrs
Tibbs
's
;
and
as
one
meal
went
off
very
like
another
on
all
ordinary
occasions
;
we
will
not
fatigue
our
readers
by
entering
into
any
other
detailed
account
of
the
domestic
economy
of
the
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
therefore
proceed
to
events
,
merely
premising
that
the
mysterious
tenant
of
the
back
drawing
-
room
was
a
lazy
,
selfish
hypochondriac
;
always
complaining
and
never
ill
.
 
<EOS>
As
his
character
in
many
respects
closely
assimilated
to
that
of
Mrs
Bloss
,
a
very
warm
friendship
soon
sprung
up
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
tall
,
thin
,
and
pale
;
he
always
fancied
he
had
a
severe
pain
somewhere
or
other
,
and
his
face
invariably
wore
a
pinched
,
screwed
-
up
expression
;
he
looked
,
indeed
,
like
a
man
who
had
got
his
feet
in
a
tub
of
exceedingly
hot
water
,
against
his
will
.
   
<EOS>
For
two
or
three
months
after
Mrs
Bloss
's
first
appearance
in
Coram
-
street
,
John
Evenson
was
observed
to
become
,
every
day
,
more
sarcastic
and
more
ill
-
natured
;
and
there
was
a
degree
of
additional
importance
in
his
manner
,
which
clearly
showed
that
he
fancied
he
had
discovered
something
,
which
he
only
wanted
a
proper
opportunity
of
divulging
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
it
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
One
evening
,
the
different
inmates
of
the
house
were
assembled
in
the
drawing
-
room
engaged
in
their
ordinary
occupations
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gobler
and
Mrs
Bloss
were
sitting
at
a
small
card
-
table
near
the
centre
window
,
playing
cribbage
;
Mr
Wisbottle
was
describing
semicircles
on
the
music
-
stool
,
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
on
the
piano
,
and
humming
most
melodiously
;
Alfred
Tomkins
was
sitting
at
the
round
table
,
with
his
elbows
duly
squared
,
making
a
pencil
sketch
of
a
head
considerably
larger
than
his
own
;
O'Bleary
was
reading
Horace
,
and
trying
to
look
as
if
he
understood
it
;
and
John
Evenson
had
drawn
his
chair
close
to
Mrs
Tibbs
's
work
-
table
,
and
was
talking
to
her
very
earnestly
in
a
low
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
,
Mrs
Tibbs
,
"
said
the
radical
,
laying
his
forefinger
on
the
muslin
she
was
at
work
on
;
"
I
can
assure
you
,
Mrs
Tibbs
,
that
nothing
but
the
interest
I
take
in
your
welfare
would
induce
me
to
make
this
communication
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
,
I
fear
Wisbottle
is
endeavouring
to
gain
the
affections
of
that
young
woman
,
Agnes
,
and
that
he
is
in
the
habit
of
meeting
her
in
the
store
-
room
on
the
first
floor
,
over
the
leads
.
 
<EOS>
From
my
bedroom
I
distinctly
heard
voices
there
,
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
my
door
immediately
,
and
crept
very
softly
on
to
the
landing
;
there
I
saw
Mr
Tibbs
,
who
,
it
seems
,
had
been
disturbed
also
.
<EOS>
---
Bless
me
,
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
,
you
change
colour
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
---
it
's
nothing
,
"
returned
Mrs
T
in
a
hurried
manner
;
"
it
's
only
the
heat
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
flush
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs
Bloss
from
the
card
-
table
;
"
that
's
good
for
four
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
it
was
Mr
Wisbottle
,
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
after
a
pause
,
"
he
should
leave
this
house
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
!
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
I
thought
,
"
continued
the
hostess
with
a
most
threatening
air
,
"
if
I
thought
he
was
assisted
by
Mr
Tibbs
---
"
   
"
One
for
his
nob
!
"
said
Gobler
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
Evenson
,
in
a
most
soothing
tone
---
he
liked
to
make
mischief
---
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
Mr
Tibbs
was
not
in
any
way
implicated
.
<EOS>
He
always
appeared
to
me
very
harmless
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
generally
found
him
so
,
"
sobbed
poor
little
Mrs
Tibbs
;
crying
like
a
watering
-
pot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
<EOS>
pray
---
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
---
consider
---
we
shall
be
observed
---
<EOS>
pray
,
do
n't
!
"
said
John
Evenson
,
fearing
his
whole
plan
would
be
interrupted
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
set
the
matter
at
rest
with
the
utmost
care
,
and
I
shall
be
most
happy
to
assist
you
in
doing
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
murmured
her
thanks
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
think
every
one
has
retired
to
rest
to
-
night
,
"
said
Evenson
very
pompously
,
"
if
you
'll
meet
me
without
a
light
,
just
outside
my
bedroom
door
,
by
the
staircase
window
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
can
ascertain
who
the
parties
really
are
,
and
you
will
afterwards
be
enabled
to
proceed
as
you
think
proper
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
was
easily
persuaded
;
her
curiosity
was
excited
,
her
jealousy
was
roused
,
and
the
arrangement
was
forthwith
made
.
 
<EOS>
She
resumed
her
work
,
and
John
Evenson
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
looking
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
The
game
of
cribbage
was
over
,
and
conversation
began
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
O'Bleary
,
"
said
the
humming
-
top
,
turning
round
on
his
pivot
,
and
facing
the
company
,
"
what
did
you
think
of
Vauxhall
the
other
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
very
fair
,
"
replied
Orson
,
who
had
been
enthusiastically
delighted
with
the
whole
exhibition
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
saw
anything
like
that
Captain
Ross
's
set
-
out
---
eh
?
"
   
"
No
,
"
returned
the
patriot
,
with
his
usual
reservation
---
"
except
in
Dublin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
the
Count
de
Canky
and
Captain
Fitzthompson
in
the
Gardens
,
"
said
Wisbottle
;
"
they
appeared
much
delighted
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
it
MUST
be
beautiful
,
"
snarled
Evenson
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
white
bears
is
partickerlerly
well
done
,
"
suggested
Mrs
Bloss
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
their
shaggy
white
coats
,
they
look
just
like
Polar
bears
---
<EOS>
do
n't
you
think
they
do
,
Mr
Evenson
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
look
a
great
deal
more
like
omnibus
cads
on
all
fours
,
"
replied
the
discontented
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
the
whole
,
I
should
have
liked
our
evening
very
well
,
"
gasped
Gobler
;
"
only
I
caught
a
desperate
cold
which
increased
my
pain
dreadfully
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
have
several
shower
-
baths
,
before
I
could
leave
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
things
those
shower
-
baths
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Wisbottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Excellent
!
"
said
Tomkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Delightful
!
"
<EOS>
chimed
in
O'Bleary
.
 
<EOS>
(
He
had
once
seen
one
,
outside
a
tinman
's
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Disgusting
machines
!
"
rejoined
Evenson
,
who
extended
his
dislike
to
almost
every
created
object
,
masculine
,
feminine
,
or
neuter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Disgusting
,
Mr
Evenson
!
"
said
Gobler
,
in
a
tone
of
strong
indignation
.
<EOS>
---
"
Disgusting
!
 
<EOS>
Look
at
their
utility
---
consider
how
many
lives
they
have
saved
by
promoting
perspiration
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Promoting
perspiration
,
indeed
,
"
growled
John
Evenson
,
stopping
short
in
his
walk
across
the
large
squares
in
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
---
<EOS>
"
I
was
ass
enough
to
be
persuaded
some
time
ago
to
have
one
in
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
'
Gad
,
I
was
in
it
once
,
and
it
effectually
cured
ME
,
for
the
mere
sight
of
it
<EOS>
threw
me
into
a
profuse
perspiration
for
six
months
afterwards
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
titter
followed
this
announcement
,
and
before
it
had
subsided
James
brought
up
"
the
tray
,
"
containing
the
remains
of
a
leg
of
lamb
which
had
made
its
DEBUT
at
dinner
;
bread
;
cheese
;
an
atom
of
butter
in
a
forest
of
parsley
;
one
pickled
walnut
and
the
third
of
another
;
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
disappeared
,
and
returned
again
with
another
tray
,
containing
glasses
and
jugs
of
hot
and
cold
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
brought
in
their
spirit
-
bottles
;
the
housemaid
placed
divers
plated
bedroom
candlesticks
under
the
card
-
table
;
and
the
servants
retired
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
Chairs
were
drawn
round
the
table
,
and
the
conversation
proceeded
in
the
customary
manner
.
 
<EOS>
John
Evenson
,
who
never
ate
supper
,
lolled
on
the
sofa
,
and
amused
himself
by
contradicting
everybody
.
<EOS>
O'Bleary
ate
as
much
as
he
could
conveniently
carry
,
and
Mrs
Tibbs
felt
a
due
degree
of
indignation
thereat
;
Mr
Gobler
and
Mrs
Bloss
conversed
most
affectionately
on
the
subject
of
pill
-
taking
,
and
other
innocent
amusements
;
and
Tomkins
and
Wisbottle
"
got
into
an
argument
;
"
that
is
to
say
,
they
both
talked
very
loudly
and
vehemently
,
each
flattering
himself
that
he
had
got
some
advantage
about
something
,
and
neither
of
them
having
more
than
a
very
indistinct
idea
of
what
they
were
talking
about
.
 
<EOS>
An
hour
or
two
passed
away
;
and
the
boarders
and
the
plated
candlesticks
retired
in
pairs
to
their
respective
bedrooms
.
 
<EOS>
John
Evenson
pulled
off
his
boots
,
locked
his
door
,
and
determined
to
sit
up
until
Mr
Gobler
had
retired
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
sat
in
the
drawing
-
room
an
hour
after
everybody
else
had
left
it
,
taking
medicine
,
and
groaning
.
   
<EOS>
Great
Coram
-
street
was
hushed
into
a
state
of
profound
repose
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
nearly
two
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
A
hackney
-
coach
now
and
then
rumbled
slowly
by
;
and
occasionally
some
stray
lawyer
's
clerk
,
on
his
way
home
to
Somers
-
town
,
struck
his
iron
heel
on
the
top
of
the
coal
-
cellar
with
a
noise
resembling
the
click
of
a
smoke
-
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
A
low
,
monotonous
,
gushing
sound
was
heard
,
which
added
considerably
to
the
romantic
dreariness
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
water
"
coming
in
"
at
number
eleven
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
asleep
by
this
time
,
"
said
John
Evenson
to
himself
,
after
waiting
with
exemplary
patience
for
nearly
an
hour
after
Mr
Gobler
had
left
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
for
a
few
moments
;
the
house
was
perfectly
quiet
;
he
extinguished
his
rushlight
,
and
opened
his
bedroom
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
staircase
was
so
dark
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
.
   
<EOS>
"
S
-
s
-
s
!
"
whispered
the
mischief
-
maker
,
making
a
noise
like
the
first
indication
a
catherine
-
wheel
gives
of
the
probability
of
its
going
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
somebody
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
you
,
Mrs
Tibbs
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
;
"
and
the
misty
outline
of
Mrs
Tibbs
appeared
at
the
staircase
window
,
like
the
ghost
of
Queen
Anne
in
the
tent
scene
in
Richard
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
way
,
Mrs
Tibbs
,
"
whispered
the
delighted
busybody
:
 
"
give
me
your
hand
---
there
!
 
<EOS>
Whoever
these
people
are
,
they
are
in
the
store
-
room
now
,
for
I
have
been
looking
down
from
my
window
,
and
I
could
see
that
they
accidentally
upset
their
candlestick
,
and
are
now
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
shoes
on
,
have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
little
Mrs
Tibbs
,
who
could
hardly
speak
for
trembling
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
I
have
taken
my
boots
off
,
so
we
can
go
down
,
close
to
the
store
-
room
door
,
and
listen
over
the
banisters
;
"
and
down
-
stairs
<EOS>
they
both
crept
accordingly
,
every
board
creaking
like
a
patent
mangle
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
Wisbottle
and
somebody
,
I
'll
swear
,
"
exclaimed
the
radical
in
an
energetic
whisper
,
when
they
had
listened
for
a
few
moments
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
---
pray
let
's
hear
what
they
say
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Tibbs
,
the
gratification
of
whose
curiosity
was
now
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
believe
you
,
"
said
a
female
voice
coquettishly
,
"
I
'd
be
bound
to
settle
my
missis
for
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
does
she
say
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Evenson
,
who
was
not
<EOS>
quite
so
well
situated
as
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
says
she
'll
settle
her
missis
's
life
,
"
replied
Mrs
Tibbs
.
<EOS>
"
The
wretch
!
<EOS>
they
're
plotting
murder
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
want
money
,
"
continued
the
voice
,
which
belonged
to
Agnes
;
"
and
if
you
'd
secure
me
the
five
hundred
pound
,
I
warrant
she
should
take
fire
soon
enough
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Evenson
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
just
hear
enough
to
want
to
hear
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
says
she
'll
set
the
house
on
fire
,
"
replied
the
affrighted
Mrs
Tibbs
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
thank
God
I
'm
insured
in
the
Phoenix
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
moment
I
have
secured
your
mistress
,
my
dear
,
"
said
a
man
's
voice
in
a
strong
Irish
brogue
,
"
you
may
depend
on
having
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
,
it
's
Mr
O'Bleary
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs
Tibbs
,
in
a
parenthesis
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
villain
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
indignant
Mr
Evenson
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
first
thing
to
be
done
,
"
continued
the
Hibernian
,
"
is
to
poison
Mr
Gobler
's
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
returned
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Evenson
again
,
in
an
agony
of
curiosity
and
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
says
she
's
to
mind
and
poison
Mr
Gobler
,
"
replied
Mrs
Tibbs
,
aghast
at
this
sacrifice
of
human
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
in
regard
of
Mrs
Tibbs
,
"
continued
O'Bleary
.
<EOS>
---
Mrs
Tibbs
shuddered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
exclaimed
Agnes
,
in
a
tone
of
the
greatest
alarm
,
just
as
Mrs
Tibbs
was
on
the
extreme
verge
of
a
fainting
fit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
exclaimed
Evenson
,
at
the
same
moment
to
Mrs
Tibbs
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
somebody
coming
UP
-
stairs
,
"
said
Agnes
to
O'Bleary
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
somebody
coming
DOWN
-
stairs
,
"
whispered
Evenson
to
Mrs
Tibbs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
into
the
parlour
,
sir
,
"
said
Agnes
to
her
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
get
there
,
before
whoever
it
is
,
gets
to
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
drawing
-
room
,
Mrs
Tibbs
!
"
whispered
the
astonished
Evenson
to
his
equally
astonished
companion
;
and
for
the
drawing
-
room
they
both
made
,
plainly
hearing
the
rustling
of
two
persons
,
one
coming
down
-
stairs
,
and
one
coming
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
can
it
be
?
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Tibbs
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
found
in
this
situation
for
the
world
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
"
returned
Evenson
,
who
could
never
bear
a
joke
at
his
own
expense
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
here
they
are
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
fun
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
one
of
the
new
-
comers
.
<EOS>
---
It
was
Wisbottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Glorious
!
"
replied
his
companion
,
in
an
equally
low
tone
.
<EOS>
---
This
was
Alfred
Tomkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
would
have
thought
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
so
,
"
said
Wisbottle
,
in
a
most
knowing
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
,
he
has
paid
her
most
extraordinary
attention
for
the
last
two
months
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
'em
when
I
was
sitting
at
the
piano
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
do
you
know
I
did
n't
notice
it
?
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Tomkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
notice
it
!
"
<EOS>
continued
Wisbottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
;
I
saw
him
whispering
to
her
,
and
she
crying
;
and
then
I
'll
swear
I
heard
him
say
something
about
to
-
night
when
we
were
all
in
bed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
talking
of
US
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
agonised
Mrs
Tibbs
,
as
the
painful
suspicion
,
and
a
sense
of
their
situation
,
flashed
upon
her
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
---
I
know
it
,
"
replied
Evenson
,
with
a
melancholy
consciousness
that
there
was
no
mode
of
escape
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
we
can
not
both
stop
here
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs
Tibbs
,
in
a
state
of
partial
derangement
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
get
up
the
chimney
,
"
replied
Evenson
,
who
really
meant
what
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
,
"
said
Mrs
Tibbs
,
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
---
 
<EOS>
it
's
a
register
stove
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
repeated
John
Evenson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
---
hush
!
"
<EOS>
cried
somebody
down
-
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
d
-
d
hushing
!
"
said
Alfred
Tomkins
,
who
began
to
get
rather
bewildered
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
they
are
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
sapient
Wisbottle
,
as
a
rustling
noise
was
heard
in
the
store
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
whispered
both
the
young
men
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
repeated
Mrs
Tibbs
and
Evenson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
alone
,
sir
,
"
said
a
female
voice
in
the
store
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Hagnes
!
"
cried
another
voice
,
which
clearly
belonged
to
Tibbs
,
for
nobody
else
ever
owned
one
like
it
,
"
Oh
,
Hagnes
---
lovely
creature
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
quiet
,
sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
A
bounce
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Hag
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Be
quiet
,
sir
---
I
am
ashamed
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
your
wife
,
Mr
Tibbs
.
 
<EOS>
Be
quiet
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
wife
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
valorous
Tibbs
,
who
was
clearly
under
the
influence
of
gin
-
and
-
water
,
and
a
misplaced
attachment
;
"
I
ate
her
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Hagnes
!
<EOS>
when
I
was
in
the
volunteer
corps
,
in
eighteen
hundred
and
---
"
   
"
I
declare
I
'll
scream
.
 
<EOS>
Be
quiet
,
sir
,
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
(
Another
bounce
and
a
scuffle
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Tibbs
,
with
a
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
what
?
"
said
Agnes
,
stopping
short
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
have
done
it
nicely
now
,
sir
,
"
sobbed
the
frightened
Agnes
,
as
a
tapping
was
heard
at
Mrs
Tibbs
's
bedroom
door
,
which
would
have
beaten
any
dozen
woodpeckers
hollow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Tibbs
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
!
<EOS>
"
called
out
Mrs
Bloss
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Tibbs
,
pray
get
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Here
the
imitation
of
a
woodpecker
was
resumed
with
tenfold
violence
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
---
dear
!
"
exclaimed
the
wretched
partner
of
the
depraved
Tibbs
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
knocking
at
my
door
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
be
discovered
!
 
<EOS>
What
will
they
think
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Tibbs
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
!
"
screamed
the
woodpecker
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Gobler
,
bursting
out
of
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
like
the
dragon
at
Astley
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
Gobler
!
"
cried
Mrs
Bloss
,
with
a
proper
approximation
to
hysterics
;
"
I
think
the
house
is
on
fire
,
or
else
there
's
thieves
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
the
most
dreadful
noises
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
devil
you
have
!
"
shouted
Gobler
again
,
bouncing
back
into
his
den
,
in
happy
imitation
of
the
aforesaid
dragon
,
and
returning
immediately
with
a
lighted
candle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
this
?
 
<EOS>
Wisbottle
!
<EOS>
Tomkins
!
 
<EOS>
O'Bleary
!
 
<EOS>
Agnes
!
 
<EOS>
What
the
deuce
!
<EOS>
all
up
and
dressed
?
"
   
"
Astonishing
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Bloss
,
who
had
run
down
-
stairs
,
and
taken
Mr
Gobler
's
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Call
Mrs
Tibbs
directly
,
somebody
,
"
said
Gobler
,
turning
into
the
front
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
---
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
and
Mr
Evenson
!
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Tibbs
and
Mr
Evenson
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
everybody
,
as
that
unhappy
pair
were
discovered
:
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tibbs
seated
in
an
arm
-
chair
by
the
fireplace
,
and
Mr
Evenson
standing
by
her
side
,
   
<EOS>
We
must
leave
the
scene
that
ensued
to
the
reader
's
imagination
.
<EOS>
We
could
tell
,
how
Mrs
Tibbs
forthwith
fainted
away
,
and
how
it
required
the
united
strength
of
Mr
Wisbottle
and
Mr
Alfred
Tomkins
to
hold
her
in
her
chair
;
how
Mr
Evenson
explained
,
and
how
his
explanation
was
evidently
disbelieved
;
how
Agnes
repelled
the
accusations
of
Mrs
Tibbs
by
proving
that
she
was
negotiating
with
Mr
O'Bleary
to
influence
her
mistress
's
affections
in
his
behalf
;
and
how
Mr
Gobler
threw
a
damp
counterpane
on
the
hopes
of
Mr
O'Bleary
by
avowing
that
he
(
Gobler
)
had
already
proposed
to
,
and
been
accepted
by
,
Mrs
Bloss
;
how
Agnes
was
discharged
from
that
lady
's
service
;
how
Mr
O'Bleary
discharged
himself
from
Mrs
Tibbs
's
house
,
without
going
through
the
form
of
previously
discharging
his
bill
;
and
how
that
disappointed
young
gentleman
rails
against
England
and
the
English
,
and
vows
there
is
no
virtue
or
fine
feeling
extant
,
"
except
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
repeat
that
we
COULD
tell
all
this
,
but
we
love
to
exercise
our
self
-
denial
,
and
we
therefore
prefer
leaving
it
to
be
imagined
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
whom
we
have
hitherto
described
as
Mrs
Bloss
,
is
no
more
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Gobler
exists
:
 
Mrs
Bloss
has
left
us
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
secluded
retreat
in
Newington
Butts
,
far
,
far
removed
from
the
noisy
strife
of
that
great
boarding
-
house
,
the
world
,
the
enviable
Gobler
and
his
pleasing
wife
revel
in
retirement
:
 
happy
in
their
complaints
,
their
table
,
and
their
medicine
,
wafted
through
life
by
the
grateful
prayers
of
all
the
purveyors
of
animal
food
within
three
miles
round
.
   
<EOS>
We
would
willingly
stop
here
,
but
we
have
a
painful
duty
imposed
upon
us
,
which
we
must
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Tibbs
have
separated
by
mutual
consent
,
Mrs
Tibbs
receiving
one
moiety
of
43L.
 
<EOS>
15S.
10D.
,
which
we
before
stated
to
be
the
amount
of
her
husband
's
annual
income
,
and
Mr
Tibbs
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
spending
the
evening
of
his
days
in
retirement
;
and
he
is
spending
also
,
annually
,
that
small
but
honourable
independence
.
 
<EOS>
He
resides
among
the
original
settlers
at
Walworth
;
and
it
has
been
stated
,
on
unquestionable
authority
,
that
the
conclusion
of
the
volunteer
story
has
been
heard
in
a
small
tavern
in
that
respectable
neighbourhood
.
   
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Mrs
Tibbs
has
determined
to
dispose
of
the
whole
of
her
furniture
by
public
auction
,
and
to
retire
from
a
residence
in
which
she
has
suffered
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Robins
has
been
applied
to
,
to
conduct
the
sale
,
and
the
transcendent
abilities
of
the
literary
gentlemen
connected
with
his
establishment
are
now
devoted
to
the
task
of
drawing
up
the
preliminary
advertisement
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
to
contain
,
among
a
variety
of
brilliant
matter
,
seventy
-
eight
words
in
large
capitals
,
and
six
original
quotations
in
inverted

Mr
Minns
and
his
cousin
Mr
Augustus
Minns
was
a
bachelor
,
of
about
forty
as
he
said
---
of
about
eight
-
and
-
forty
as
his
friends
said
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
exceedingly
clean
,
precise
,
and
tidy
;
perhaps
somewhat
priggish
,
and
the
most
retiring
man
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
usually
wore
a
brown
frock
-
coat
without
a
wrinkle
,
light
inexplicables
without
a
spot
,
a
neat
neckerchief
with
a
remarkably
neat
tie
,
and
boots
without
a
fault
;
moreover
,
he
always
carried
a
brown
silk
umbrella
with
an
ivory
handle
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
clerk
in
Somerset
-
house
,
or
,
as
he
said
himself
,
he
held
"
a
responsible
situation
under
Government
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
good
and
increasing
salary
,
in
addition
to
some
10,000L.
of
his
own
(
invested
in
the
funds
)
,
and
he
occupied
a
first
floor
in
Tavistock
-
street
,
Covent
-
garden
,
where
he
had
resided
for
twenty
years
,
having
been
in
the
habit
of
quarrelling
with
his
landlord
the
whole
time
:
 
regularly
giving
notice
of
his
intention
to
quit
on
the
first
day
of
every
quarter
,
and
as
regularly
countermanding
it
on
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
classes
of
created
objects
which
he
held
in
the
deepest
and
most
unmingled
horror
;
these
were
dogs
,
and
children
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
unamiable
,
but
he
could
,
at
any
time
,
have
viewed
the
execution
of
a
dog
,
or
the
assassination
of
an
infant
,
with
the
liveliest
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Their
habits
were
at
variance
with
his
love
of
order
;
and
his
love
of
order
was
as
powerful
as
his
love
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Augustus
Minns
had
no
relations
,
in
or
near
London
,
with
the
exception
of
his
cousin
,
Mr
Octavius
Budden
,
to
whose
son
,
whom
he
had
never
seen
(
for
he
disliked
the
father
)
,
he
had
consented
to
become
godfather
by
proxy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Budden
having
realised
a
moderate
fortune
by
exercising
the
trade
or
calling
of
a
corn
-
chandler
,
and
having
a
great
predilection
for
the
country
,
had
purchased
a
cottage
in
the
vicinity
of
Stamford
-
hill
,
whither
he
retired
with
the
wife
of
his
bosom
,
and
his
only
son
,
Master
Alexander
Augustus
Budden
.
 
<EOS>
One
evening
,
as
Mr
and
Mrs
B
were
admiring
their
son
,
discussing
his
various
merits
,
talking
over
his
education
,
and
disputing
whether
the
classics
should
be
made
an
essential
part
thereof
,
the
lady
pressed
so
strongly
upon
her
husband
the
propriety
of
cultivating
the
friendship
of
Mr
Minns
in
behalf
of
their
son
,
that
Mr
Budden
at
last
made
up
his
mind
,
that
it
should
not
be
his
fault
if
he
and
his
cousin
were
not
in
future
more
intimate
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
break
the
ice
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Budden
,
stirring
up
the
sugar
at
the
bottom
of
his
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
casting
a
sidelong
look
at
his
spouse
to
see
the
effect
of
the
announcement
of
his
determination
,
"
by
asking
Minns
down
to
dine
with
us
,
on
Sunday
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
pray
,
Budden
,
write
to
your
cousin
at
once
,
"
replied
Mrs
Budden
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
knows
,
if
we
could
only
get
him
down
here
,
but
he
might
take
a
fancy
to
our
Alexander
,
and
leave
him
his
property
?
<EOS>
---
Alick
,
my
dear
,
take
your
legs
off
the
rail
of
the
chair
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
"
said
Mr
Budden
,
musing
,
"
very
true
indeed
,
my
love
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
as
Mr
Minns
was
sitting
at
his
breakfast
-
table
,
alternately
biting
his
dry
toast
and
casting
a
look
upon
the
columns
of
his
morning
paper
,
which
he
always
read
from
the
title
to
the
printer
's
name
,
he
heard
a
loud
knock
at
the
street
-
door
;
which
was
shortly
afterwards
followed
by
the
entrance
of
his
servant
,
who
put
into
his
hands
a
particularly
small
card
,
on
which
was
engraven
in
immense
letters
,
"

Octavius
Budden

Mrs

"
   
<EOS>
"
Budden

"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Minns
,
"
what
can
bring
that
vulgar
man
here
!
<EOS>
---
say
I
'm
asleep
---
say
I
'm
out

and
shall
never
be
home
again

anything

keep
him
down

stairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
please
,
sir
,
the
gentleman
's
coming
up
,
"
replied
the
servant
,
and
the
fact
was
made
evident
,
by
an
appalling
creaking
of
boots
on
the
staircase
accompanied
by
a
pattering
noise
;
the
cause
of
which
,
Minns
could
not
,
for
the
life
of
him
,
divine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
---
show
the
gentleman
in
,
"
said
the
unfortunate
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
Exit
servant
,
and
enter
Octavius
preceded
by
a
large
white
dog
,
dressed
in
a
suit
of
fleecy
hosiery
,
with
pink
eyes
,
large
ears
,
and
no
perceptible
tail
.
   
<EOS>
The
cause
of
the
pattering
on
the
stairs
was
but
too
plain
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Augustus
Minns
staggered
beneath
the
shock
of
the
dog
's
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
how
are
you
?
"
said
Budden
,
as
he
entered
.
   
<EOS>
He
always
spoke
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
and
always
said
the
same
thing
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
my
hearty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Budden
?
---
<EOS>
pray
take
a
chair
!
"
<EOS>
politely
stammered
the
discomfited
Minns
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
---
thank
you
---
<EOS>
well
---
how
are
you
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Uncommonly
well
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Minns
,
casting
a
diabolical
look
at
the
dog
,
who
,
with
his
hind
legs
on
the
floor
,
and
his
fore
paws
resting
on
the
table
,
was
dragging
a
bit
of
bread
and
butter
out
of
a
plate
,
preparatory
to
devouring
it
,
with
the
buttered
side
next
the
carpet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
rogue
!
<EOS>
"
said
Budden
to
his
dog
;
"
you
see
,
Minns
,
he
's
like
me
,
always
at
home
,
eh
,
my
boy
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Egad
,
I
'm
precious
hot

hungry

<EOS>
I
've
walked
all
the
way
from
Stamford

hill
this
morning

<EOS>
"
   
"
Have
you
breakfasted
?
"
inquired
Minns
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
---
came
to
breakfast
with
you
;
so
ring
the
bell
,
my
dear
fellow
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
and
let
's
have
another
cup
and
saucer
,
and
the
cold
ham
.
<EOS>
---
Make
myself
at
home
,
you
see
!
"
<EOS>
continued
Budden
,
dusting
his
boots
with
a
table
-
napkin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha

---
ha

---
ha
!
---
'
pon
my
life

I
'm
hungry

"
   
<EOS>
Minns
rang
the
bell
,
and
tried
to
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
decidedly
never
was
so
hot
in
my
life
,
"
continued
Octavius
,
wiping
his
forehead
;
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
how
are
you
,
Minns
?
 
<EOS>
"
Pon
my
soul
,
you
wear
capitally
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
D'ye
think
so
?
"
said
Minns
;
and
he
tried
another
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
'
Pon
my
life
,
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
B
and
<EOS>
---
what
's
his
name
---
quite
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Alick
---
my
son
,
you
mean
;
never
better
---
never
better
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
such
a
place
as
we
've
got
at
Poplar
-
walk
,
you
know
,
he
could
n't
be
ill
if
he
tried
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
first
saw
it
,
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
it
looked
so
knowing
,
with
the
front
garden
,
and
the
green
railings
and
the
brass
knocker
,
and
all
that
<EOS>
---
I
really
thought
it
was
a
cut
above
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
you
'd
like
the
ham
better
,
"
interrupted
Minns
,
"
if
you
cut
it
the
other
way
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
saw
,
with
feelings
which
it
is
impossible
to
describe
,
that
his
visitor
was
cutting
or
rather
maiming
the
ham
,
in
utter
violation
of
all
established
rules
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
ye
,
"
returned
Budden
,
with
the
most
barbarous
indifference
to
crime
,
"
<EOS>
I
prefer
it
this
way
,
it
eats
short
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
say
,
Minns
,
when
will
you
come
down
and
see
us
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
delighted
with
the
place
;
I
know
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
and
I
were
talking
about
you
the
other
night
,
and
Amelia
said
---
another
lump
of
sugar
,
please
;
thank
ye
---
<EOS>
she
said
,
<EOS>
do
n't
you
think
you
could
contrive
,
my
dear
,
to
say
to
Mr
Minns
,
in
a
friendly
way
---
come
down
,
sir
---
damn
the
dog
!
<EOS>
he
's
spoiling
your
curtains
,
Minns
---
ha
!
<EOS>
---
ha
!
<EOS>
---
ha

"
 
<EOS>
Minns
leaped
from
his
seat
as
though
he
had
received
the
discharge
from
a
galvanic
battery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
out
,
sir
!
---
go
out
,
hoo
!
"
<EOS>
cried
poor
Augustus
,
keeping
,
nevertheless
,
at
a
very
respectful
distance
from
the
dog
;
having
read
of
a
case
of
hydrophobia
in
the
paper
of
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
By
dint
of
great
exertion
,
much
shouting
,
and
a
marvellous
deal
of
poking
under
the
tables
with
a
stick
and
umbrella
,
the
dog
was
at
last
dislodged
,
and
placed
on
the
landing
outside
the
door
,
where
he
immediately
commenced
a
most
appalling
howling
;
at
the
same
time
vehemently
scratching
the
paint
off
the
two
nicely
-
varnished
bottom
panels
,
until
they
resembled
the
interior
of
a
backgammon
-
board
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
good
dog
for
the
country
that
!
"
<EOS>
coolly
observed
Budden
to
the
distracted
Minns
,
"
but
he
's
not
much
used
to
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
Minns
,
when
will
you
come
down
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
no
denial
,
positively
.
<EOS>
Let
's
see
,
to
-
day
's
Thursday
.
<EOS>
---
Will
you
come
on
Sunday
?
 
<EOS>
We
dine
at
five
,
do
n't
say
no
---
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
great
deal
of
pressing
,
Mr
Augustus
Minns
,
driven
to
despair
,
accepted
the
invitation
,
and
promised
to
be
at
Poplar
-
walk
on
the
ensuing
Sunday
,
at
a
quarter
before
five
to
the
minute
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
mind
the
direction
,
"
said
Budden
:
 
"
the
coach
goes
from
the
Flower
-
pot
,
in
Bishopsgate
-
street
,
every
half
hour
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
coach
stops
at
the
Swan
,
you
'll
see
,
immediately
opposite
you
,
a
white
house
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
is
your
house
---
I
understand
,
"
said
Minns
,
wishing
to
cut
short
the
visit
,
and
the
story
,
at
the
same
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
that
's
not
mine
;
that
's
Grogus
's
,
the
great
ironmonger
's
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
say
<EOS>
---
you
turn
down
by
the
side
of
the
white
house
till
you
ca
n't
go
another
step
further
---
mind
that
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
then
you
turn
to
your
right
,
by
some
stables
---
well
;
close
to
you
,
<EOS>
you
'll
see
a
wall
with
"
Beware
of
the
Dog
"
written
on
it
in
large
letters
---
(
Minns
shuddered
)
---
<EOS>
go
along
by
the
side
of
that
wall
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
---
and
anybody
will
show
you
which
is
my
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
---
thank
ye

<EOS>
good

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
punctual
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
:
 
good
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Minns
,
you
've
got
a
card
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
;
thank
ye
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Octavius
Budden
departed
,
leaving
his
cousin
looking
forward
to
his
visit
on
the
following
Sunday
,
with
the
feelings
of
a
penniless
poet
to
the
weekly
visit
of
his
Scotch
landlady
.
   
<EOS>
Sunday
arrived
;
the
sky
was
bright
and
clear
;
crowds
of
people
were
hurrying
along
the
streets
,
intent
on
their
different
schemes
of
pleasure
for
the
day
;
everything
and
everybody
looked
cheerful
and
happy
except
Mr
Augustus
Minns
.
   
<EOS>
The
day
was
fine
,
but
the
heat
was
considerable
;
when
Mr
Minns
had
fagged
up
the
shady
side
of
Fleet
-
street
,
Cheapside
,
and
Threadneedle
-
street
,
he
had
become
pretty
warm
,
tolerably
dusty
,
and
it
was
getting
late
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
most
extraordinary
good
fortune
,
however
,
a
coach
was
waiting
at
the
Flower
-
pot
,
into
which
Mr
Augustus
Minns
got
,
on
the
solemn
assurance
of
the
cad
that
the
vehicle
would
start
in
three
minutes
---
that
being
the
very
utmost
extremity
of
time
it
was
allowed
to
wait
by
Act
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
,
and
there
were
no
signs
of
moving
.
 
<EOS>
Minns
looked
at
his
watch
for
the
sixth
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Coachman
,
are
you
going
or
not
?
"
<EOS>
bawled
Mr
Minns
,
with
his
head
and
half
his
body
out
of
the
coach
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
Di
-
rectly
,
sir
,
"
said
the
coachman
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
looking
as
much
unlike
a
man
in
a
hurry
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bill
,
take
them
cloths
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
Five
minutes
more
elapsed
:
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
coachman
mounted
the
box
,
from
whence
he
looked
down
the
street
,
and
up
the
street
,
and
hailed
all
the
pedestrians
for
another
five
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Coachman
!
<EOS>
if
you
do
n't
go
this
moment
,
I
shall
get
out
,
"
said
Mr
Minns
,
rendered
desperate
by
the
lateness
of
the
hour
,
and
the
impossibility
of
being
in
Poplar
-
walk
at
the
appointed
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Going
this
minute
,
sir
,
"
was
the
reply
;
---
and
,
accordingly
,
the
machine
trundled
on
for
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
,
and
then
stopped
again
.
 
<EOS>
Minns
doubled
himself
up
in
a
corner
of
the
coach
,
and
abandoned
himself
to
his
fate
,
as
a
child
,
a
mother
,
a
bandbox
and
a
parasol
,
became
his
fellow
-
passengers
.
   
<EOS>
The
child
was
an
affectionate
and
an
amiable
infant
;
the
little
dear
mistook
Minns
for
his
other
parent
,
and
screamed
to
embrace
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
quiet
,
dear
,
"
said
the
mamma
,
restraining
the
impetuosity
of
the
darling
,
whose
little
fat
legs
were
kicking
,
and
stamping
,
and
twining
themselves
into
the
most
complicated
forms
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
quiet
,
dear
,
that
's
not
your
papa
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
<EOS>
I
am
not
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Minns
,
as
the
first
gleam
of
pleasure
he
had
experienced
that
morning
shone
like
a
meteor
through
his
wretchedness
.
   
<EOS>
Playfulness
was
agreeably
mingled
with
affection
in
the
disposition
of
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
When
satisfied
that
Mr
Minns
was
not
his
parent
,
he
endeavoured
to
attract
his
notice
by
scraping
his
drab
trousers
with
his
dirty
shoes
,
poking
his
chest
with
his
mamma
's
parasol
,
and
other
nameless
endearments
peculiar
to
infancy
,
with
which
he
beguiled
the
tediousness
of
the
ride
,
apparently
very
much
to
his
own
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
unfortunate
gentleman
arrived
at
the
Swan
,
he
found
to
his
great
dismay
,
that
it
was
a
quarter
past
five
.
 
<EOS>
The
white
house
,
the
stables
,
the
"
Beware
of
the
Dog
,
"
---
every
landmark
was
passed
,
with
a
rapidity
not
unusual
to
a
gentleman
of
a
certain
age
when
too
late
for
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
,
Mr
Minns
found
himself
opposite
a
yellow
brick
house
with
a
green
door
,
brass
knocker
,
and
door
-
plate
,
green
window
-
frames
and
ditto
railings
,
with
"
a
garden
"
in
front
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
small
loose
bit
of
gravelled
ground
,
with
one
round
and
two
scalene
triangular
beds
,
containing
a
fir
-
tree
,
twenty
or
thirty
bulbs
,
and
an
unlimited
number
of
marigolds
.
 
<EOS>
The
taste
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Budden
was
further
displayed
by
the
appearance
of
a
Cupid
on
each
side
of
the
door
,
perched
upon
a
heap
of
large
chalk
flints
,
variegated
with
pink
conch
-
shells
.
 
<EOS>
His
knock
at
the
door
was
answered
by
a
stumpy
boy
,
in
drab
livery
,
cotton
stockings
and
high
-
lows
,
who
,
after
hanging
his
hat
on
one
of
the
dozen
brass
pegs
which
ornamented
the
passage
,
denominated
by
courtesy
"
The
Hall
,
"
ushered
him
into
a
front
drawing
-
room
commanding
a
very
extensive
view
of
the
backs
of
the
neighbouring
houses
.
 
<EOS>
The
usual
ceremony
of
introduction
,
and
so
forth
,
over
,
Mr
Minns
took
his
seat
:
 
not
a
little
agitated
at
finding
that
he
was
the
last
comer
,
and
,
somehow
or
other
,
the
Lion
of
about
a
dozen
people
,
sitting
together
in
a
small
drawing
-
room
,
getting
rid
of
that
most
tedious
of
all
time
,
the
time
preceding
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Brogson
,
"
said
Budden
,
addressing
an
elderly
gentleman
in
a
black
coat
,
drab
knee
-
breeches
,
and
long
gaiters
,
who
,
under
pretence
of
inspecting
the
prints
in
an
Annual
,
had
been
engaged
in
satisfying
himself
on
the
subject
of
Mr
Minns
's
general
appearance
,
by
looking
at
him
over
the
tops
of
the
leaves
---
"
Well
,
Brogson
,
what
do
ministers
mean
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Will
they
go
out
,
or
what
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
---
why
---
really
,
you
know
,
I
'm
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
ask
for
news
.
 
<EOS>
Your
cousin
,
from
his
situation
,
is
the
most
likely
person
to
answer
the
question
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Minns
assured
the
last
speaker
,
that
although
he
was
in
Somerset
-
house
,
he
possessed
no
official
communication
relative
to
the
projects
of
his
Majesty
's
Ministers
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
remark
was
evidently
received
incredulously
;
and
no
further
conjectures
being
hazarded
on
the
subject
,
a
long
pause
ensued
,
during
which
the
company
occupied
themselves
in
coughing
and
blowing
their
noses
,
until
the
entrance
of
Mrs
Budden
caused
a
general
rise
.
   
<EOS>
The
ceremony
of
introduction
being
over
,
dinner
was
announced
,
and
down
-
stairs
the
party
proceeded
accordingly
---
<EOS>
Mr
Minns
escorting
Mrs
Budden
as
far
as
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
but
being
prevented
,
by
the
narrowness
of
the
staircase
,
from
extending
his
gallantry
any
farther
.
 
<EOS>
The
dinner
passed
off
as
such
dinners
usually
do
.
<EOS>
Ever
and
anon
,
amidst
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
,
and
the
hum
of
conversation
,
Mr
B
's
voice
might
be
heard
,
asking
a
friend
to
take
wine
,
and
assuring
him
<EOS>
he
was
glad
to
see
him
;
and
a
great
deal
of
by
-
play
took
place
between
Mrs
B
and
the
servants
,
respecting
the
removal
of
the
dishes
,
during
which
her
countenance
assumed
all
the
variations
of
a
weather
-
glass
,
from
"
stormy
"
to
"
set
fair
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
the
dessert
and
wine
being
placed
on
the
table
,
the
servant
,
in
compliance
with
a
significant
look
from
Mrs
B
,
brought
down
"
Master
Alexander
,
"
habited
in
a
sky
-
blue
suit
with
silver
buttons
;
and
possessing
hair
of
nearly
the
same
colour
as
the
metal
.
 
<EOS>
After
sundry
praises
from
his
mother
,
and
various
admonitions
as
to
his
behaviour
from
his
father
,
he
was
introduced
to
his
godfather
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
little
fellow
---
you
are
a
fine
boy
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
said
Mr
Minns
,
as
happy
as
a
tomtit
on
birdlime
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
old
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Eight
,
next
We'nsday
.
 
<EOS>
How
old
are
YOU
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Alexander
,
"
interrupted
his
mother
,
"
how
dare
you
ask
Mr
Minns
<EOS>
how
old
he
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
asked
me
how
old
I
was
,
"
said
the
precocious
child
,
to
whom
Minns
had
from
that
moment
internally
resolved
that
he
never
would
bequeath
one
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
titter
occasioned
by
the
observation
had
subsided
,
a
little
smirking
man
with
red
whiskers
,
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
who
during
the
whole
of
dinner
had
been
endeavouring
to
obtain
a
listener
to
some
stories
about
Sheridan
,
called
,
out
,
with
a
very
patronising
air
,
"
Alick
,
what
part
of
speech
is
BE
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
verb
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
good
boy
,
"
said
Mrs
Budden
,
with
all
a
mother
's
pride
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
what
a
verb
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
verb
is
a
word
which
signifies
to
be
,
to
do
,
or
to
suffer
;
as
,
I
am
---
<EOS>
I
rule
---
I
am
ruled
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
an
apple
,
Ma
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
you
an
apple
,
"
replied
the
man
with
the
red
whiskers
,
who
was
an
established
friend
of
the
family
,
or
in
other
words
was
always
invited
by
Mrs
Budden
,
whether
Mr
Budden
 
liked
it
or
not
,
"
if
you
'll
tell
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
BE
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
?
"
said
the
prodigy
,
after
a
little
hesitation
---
"
an
insect
that
gathers
honey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
dear
,
"
frowned
Mrs
Budden
;
"
<EOS>
B^
<EOS>
double
E^
is
the
substantive
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
knows
much
yet
about
COMMON
substantives
,
"
said
the
smirking
gentleman
,
who
thought
this
an
admirable
opportunity
for
letting
off
a
joke
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
clear
he
's
not
very
well
acquainted
with
PROPER
NAMES
.
 
<EOS>
He
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
he

"
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
called
out
Mr
Budden
,
from
the
end
of
the
table
,
in
a
stentorian
voice
,
and
with
a
very
important
air
,
"
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
charge
your
glasses
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
toast
to
propose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
!
<EOS>
hear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
gentlemen
,
passing
the
decanters
.
 
<EOS>
After
they
had
made
the
round
of
the
table
,
Mr
Budden
proceeded
---
"
Gentlemen
;
there
is
an
individual
present
---
"
   
"
Hear

said
the
little
man
with
red
whiskers
.
   
<EOS>
"
PRAY
be

remonstrated
Budden
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
gentlemen
,
there
is
an
individual
present

"
resumed
the
host
,
"
in
whose
society
,
I
am
sure
we
must
take
great
delight
---
and
---
and
---
the
conversation
of
that
individual
must
have
afforded
to
every
one
present

the
utmost
pleasure

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
[
"
Thank
Heaven
,
he
does
not
mean
me

"
<EOS>
thought
Minns
,
conscious
that
his
diffidence
and
exclusiveness
had
prevented
his
saying
above
a
dozen
words
since
he
entered
the
house
.
]
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
I
am
but
a
humble
individual
myself
,
and
I
perhaps
ought
to
apologise
for
allowing
any
individual
feeling
of
friendship
and
affection
for
the
person
I
allude
to
,
to
induce
me
to
venture
to
rise
,
to
propose
the
health
of
that
person
---
a
person
that
,
I
am
sure
---
<EOS>
that
is
to
say
,
a
person
whose
virtues
must
endear
him
to
those
who
know
him
---
and
those
who
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
him
,
can
not
dislike
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hear

<EOS>
hear

"
said
the
company
,
in
a
tone
of
encouragement
and
approval
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen

"
continued
Budden
,
"
my
cousin

"
 
<EOS>
(
Hear

<EOS>
Minns
groaned
audibly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
I
am
most
happy
to
see
here
,
and
who
,
if
he
were
not
here

would
certainly
have
deprived
us
of
the
great
pleasure
we
all
feel
in
seeing
him

<EOS>
(
Loud
cries
of

)
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
feel
that
I
have
already
trespassed
on
your
attention
for
too
long
a

With
every
feeling

of

with
every
sentiment
of

of

suggested
the
friend
of
the
family
.
   
<EOS>
"

Of

I
beg
to

shouted
the
indefatigable
little
man
with
the
whiskers

and
with
the
honours
.

<EOS>
All
eyes
were
now
fixed
on
the
subject
of
the
toast
,
who
by
gulping
down
port
wine
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
suffocation
,
endeavoured
to
conceal
his
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
After
as
long
a
pause
as
decency
would
admit
,
he
rose
,
but
,
as
the
newspapers
sometimes
say
in
their
reports
,
"
we
regret
that
we
are
quite
unable
to
give
even
the
substance
of
the
honourable
gentleman
's
observations
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
words
"
present
company
---
honour
---
present
occasion
,
"
and
"
great
happiness
"
---
heard
occasionally
,
and
repeated
at
intervals
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
the
utmost
confusion
and
misery
,
convinced
the
company
that
he
was
making
an
excellent
speech
;
and
,
accordingly
,
on
his
resuming
his
seat
,
they
cried
"
Bravo

"
and
manifested
tumultuous
applause
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
had
been
long
watching
his
opportunity
,
then
darted
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Budden
,
"
said
he
,
"
will
you
allow
ME
to
propose
a
toast
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
Budden
,
adding
in
an
under
-
tone
to
Minns
right
across
the
table
,
"
Devilish
sharp
fellow
that
:
 
you
'll
be
very
much
pleased
with
his
speech
.
 
<EOS>
He
talks
equally
well
on
any
subject

"
<EOS>
Minns
bowed
,
and
Mr
Jones
proceeded
:
   
"
It
has
on
several
occasions
,
in
various
instances
,
under
many
circumstances
,
and
in
different
companies
,
fallen
to
my
lot
to
propose
a
toast
to
those
by
whom
,
at
the
time
,
I
have
had
the
honour
to
be
surrounded
,
I
have
sometimes
,
I
will
cheerfully
own
---
<EOS>
for
why
should
I
deny
it
?
---
felt
the
overwhelming
nature
of
the
task
I
have
undertaken
,
and
my
own
utter
incapability
to
do
justice
to
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
If
such
have
been
my
feelings
,
however
,
on
former
occasions
,
what
must
they
be
now
---
now
---
under
the
extraordinary
circumstances
in
which
I
am
placed
.
 
<EOS>
(
Hear
!
hear

)
 
<EOS>
To
describe
my
feelings
accurately
,
would
be
impossible
;
but
I
can
not
give
you
a
better
idea
of
them
,
gentlemen
,
than
by
referring
to
a
circumstance
which
happens
,
oddly
enough
,
to
occur
to
my
mind
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
when
that
truly
great
and
illustrious
man
,
Sheridan
,
was
---
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
there
is
no
knowing
what
new
villainy
in
the
form
of
a
joke
would
have
been
heaped
on
the
grave
of
that
very
ill
-
used
man
,
<EOS>
Mr
Sheridan
,
if
the
boy
in
drab
had
not
at
that
moment
entered
the
room
in
a
breathless
state
,
to
report
that
,
as
it
was
a
very
wet
night
,
the
nine
o'clock
stage
had
come
round
,
to
know
whether
there
was
anybody
going
to
town
,
as
,
in
that
case
,
he
(
the
nine
o'clock
)
had
room
for
one
inside
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Minns
started
up
;
and
,
despite
countless
exclamations
of
surprise
,
and
entreaties
to
stay
,
persisted
in
his
determination
to
accept
the
vacant
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
brown
silk
umbrella
was
nowhere
to
be
found
;
and
as
the
coachman
could
n't
wait
,
he
drove
back
to
the
Swan
,
leaving
word
for
Mr
Minns
to
"
run
round
"
and
catch
him
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
it
did
not
occur
to
Mr
Minns
for
some
ten
minutes
or
so
,
that
he
had
left
the
brown
silk
umbrella
with
the
ivory
handle
in
the
other
coach
,
coming
down
;
and
,
moreover
,
as
he
was
by
no
means
remarkable
for
speed
,
it
is
no
matter
of
surprise
that
when
he
accomplished
the
feat
of
"
running
round
"
to
the
Swan
,
the
coach
---
the
last
coach
---
had
gone
without
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
somewhere
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
Mr
Augustus
Minns
knocked
feebly
at
the
street
-
door
of
his
lodgings
in
Tavistock
-
street
,
cold
,
wet
,
cross
,
and
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
his
will
next
morning
,
and
his
professional
man
informs
us
,
in
that
strict
confidence
in
which
we
inform
the
public
,
that
neither
the
name
of
Mr
Octavius
Budden
,
nor
of
Mrs
Amelia
Budden
,
nor
of
Master
Alexander
Augustus
Budden
,
appears
therein

Sentiment
<EOS>
The
Miss
Crumptons
,
or
to
quote
the
authority
of
the
inscription
on
the
garden
-
gate
of
Minerva
House
,
Hammersmith
,
"
The
Misses
Crumpton
,
"
were
two
unusually
tall
,
particularly
thin
,
and
exceedingly
skinny
personages
:
 
very
upright
,
and
very
yellow
.
<EOS>
Miss
Amelia
Crumpton
owned
to
thirty
-
eight
,
and
Miss
Maria
Crumpton
admitted
she
was
forty
;
an
admission
which
was
rendered
perfectly
unnecessary
by
the
self
-
evident
fact
of
her
being
at
least
fifty
.
<EOS>
They
dressed
in
the
most
interesting
manner
---
like
twins
!
<EOS>
and
looked
as
happy
and
comfortable
as
a
couple
of
marigolds
run
to
seed
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
very
precise
,
had
the
strictest
possible
ideas
of
propriety
,
wore
false
hair
,
and
always
smelt
very
strongly
of
lavender
.
   
<EOS>
Minerva
House
,
conducted
under
the
auspices
of
the
two
sisters
,
was
a
"
finishing
establishment
for
young
ladies
,
"
where
some
twenty
girls
of
the
ages
of
from
thirteen
to
nineteen
inclusive
,
acquired
a
smattering
of
everything
,
and
a
knowledge
of
nothing
;
instruction
in
French
and
Italian
,
dancing
lessons
twice
a
-
week
;
and
other
necessaries
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
a
white
one
,
a
little
removed
from
the
roadside
,
with
close
palings
in
front
.
 
<EOS>
The
bedroom
windows
were
always
left
partly
open
,
to
afford
a
bird's
-
eye
view
of
numerous
little
bedsteads
with
very
white
dimity
furniture
,
and
thereby
impress
the
passer
-
by
with
a
due
sense
of
the
luxuries
of
the
establishment
;
and
there
was
a
front
parlour
hung
round
with
highly
varnished
maps
which
nobody
ever
looked
at
,
and
filled
with
books
which
no
one
ever
read
,
appropriated
exclusively
to
the
reception
of
parents
,
who
,
whenever
they
called
,
could
not
fail
to
be
struck
with
the
very
deep
appearance
of
the
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amelia
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Miss
Maria
Crumpton
,
entering
the
school
-
room
one
morning
,
with
her
false
hair
in
papers
:
 
as
she
occasionally
did
,
in
order
to
impress
the
young
ladies
with
a
conviction
of
its
reality
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amelia
,
my
dear
,
here
is
a
most
gratifying
note
I
have
just
received

<EOS>
You
need
n't
mind
reading
it
aloud
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Amelia
,
thus
advised
,
proceeded
to
read
the
following
note
with
an
air
of
great
triumph
:
   
<EOS>
"
Cornelius

ejaculated
Amelia
,
in
an
ecstatic
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
A

"
repeated
Miss
Maria
,
with
a
smile
of
delight
,
which
,
of
course
,
elicited
a
concurrent
titter
of
pleasure
from
all
the
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
exceedingly
delightful
!
"
said
Miss
Amelia
;
whereupon
all
the
young
ladies
murmured
their
admiration
again
.

Courtiers

<EOS>
So
important
an
announcement
at
once
superseded
the
business
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
A
holiday
was
declared
,
in
commemoration
of
the
great
event
;
the
Miss
Crumptons
retired
to
their
private
apartment
to
talk
it
over
;
the
smaller
girls
discussed
the
probable
manners
and
customs
of
the
daughter
of
a
Member
of
Parliament
;
and
the
young
ladies
verging
on
eighteen
wondered
whether
she
was
engaged
,
whether
she
was
pretty
,
whether
she
wore
much
bustle
,
and
many
other
WHETHERS
of
equal
importance
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
Miss
Crumptons
proceeded
to
the
Adelphi
at
the
appointed
time
next
day
,
dressed
,
of
course
,
in
their
best
style
,
and
looking
as
amiable
as
they
possibly
could
---
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
is
not
saying
much
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Having
sent
in
their
cards
,
through
the
medium
of
a
red
-
hot
looking
footman
in
bright
livery
,
they
were
ushered
into
the
august
presence
of
the
profound
Dingwall
.
   
<EOS>
Cornelius
Brook
Dingwall
,
Esq
,
MP
,
was
very
haughty
,
solemn
,
and
portentous
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
,
naturally
,
a
somewhat
spasmodic
expression
of
countenance
,
which
was
not
rendered
the
less
remarkable
by
his
wearing
an
extremely
stiff
cravat
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
wonderfully
proud
of
the
MP
attached
to
his
name
,
and
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
reminding
people
of
his
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
great
idea
of
his
own
abilities
,
which
must
have
been
a
great
comfort
to
him
,
as
no
one
else
had
;
and
in
diplomacy
,
on
a
small
scale
,
in
his
own
family
arrangements
,
he
considered
himself
unrivalled
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
county
magistrate
,
and
discharged
the
duties
of
his
station
with
all
due
justice
and
impartiality
;
frequently
committing
poachers
,
and
occasionally
committing
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Brook
Dingwall
was
one
of
that
numerous
class
of
young
ladies
,
who
,
like
adverbs
,
may
be
known
by
their
answering
to
a
commonplace
question
,
and
doing
nothing
else
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
,
this
talented
individual
was
seated
in
a
small
library
at
a
table
covered
with
papers
,
doing
nothing
,
but
trying
to
look
busy
,
playing
at
shop
.
 
<EOS>
Acts
of
Parliament
,
and
letters
directed
to
"
Cornelius
Brook
Dingwall
,
Esq
,
MP
,
"
were
ostentatiously
scattered
over
the
table
;
at
a
little
distance
from
which
,
Mrs
Brook
Dingwall
was
seated
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
those
public
nuisances
,
a
spoiled
child
,
was
playing
about
the
room
,
dressed
after
the
most
approved
fashion
---
in
a
blue
tunic
with
a
black
belt
---
a
quarter
of
a
yard
wide
,
fastened
with
an
immense
buckle
---
looking
like
a
robber
in
a
melodrama
,
seen
through
a
diminishing
glass
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
little
pleasantry
from
the
sweet
child
,
who
amused
himself
by
running
away
with
Miss
Maria
Crumpton
's
chair
as
fast
as
it
was
placed
for
her
,
the
visitors
were
seated
,
and
Cornelius
Brook
Dingwall
,
Esq
,
opened
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
sent
for
Miss
Crumpton
,
he
said
,
in
consequence
of
the
high
character
he
had
received
of
her
establishment
from
his
friend
,
Sir
Alfred
Muggs
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Crumpton
murmured
her
acknowledgments
to
him
(
Muggs
)
,
and
Cornelius
proceeded
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
of
my
principal
reasons
,
Miss
Crumpton
,
for
parting
with
my
daughter
,
is
,
that
she
has
lately
acquired
some
sentimental
ideas
,
which
it
is
most
desirable
to
eradicate
from
her
young
mind
.
"
<EOS>
(
Here
the
little
innocent
before
noticed
,
fell
out
of
an
arm
-
chair
with
an
awful
crash
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Naughty
boy
!
<EOS>
"
said
his
mamma
,
who
appeared
more
surprised
at
his
taking
the
liberty
of
falling
down
,
than
at
anything
else
;
"
I
'll
ring
the
bell
for
James
to
take
him
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
check
him
,
my
love
,
"
said
the
diplomatist
,
as
soon
as
he
could
make
himself
heard
amidst
the
unearthly
howling
consequent
upon
the
threat
and
the
tumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
all
arises
from
his
great
flow
of
spirits
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
last
explanation
was
addressed
to
Miss
Crumpton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
antique
Maria
:
 
not
exactly
seeing
,
however
,
the
connexion
between
a
flow
of
animal
spirits
,
and
a
fall
from
an
arm
-
chair
.
   
<EOS>
Silence
was
restored
,
and
the
MP
resumed
:
 
"
Now
,
I
know
nothing
so
likely
to
effect
this
object
,
Miss
Crumpton
,
as
her
mixing
constantly
in
the
society
of
girls
of
her
own
age
;
and
,
as
I
know
that
in
your
establishment
she
will
meet
such
as
are
not
likely
to
contaminate
her
young
mind
,
I
propose
to
send
her
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
youngest
Miss
Crumpton
expressed
the
acknowledgments
of
the
establishment
generally
.
 
<EOS>
Maria
was
rendered
speechless
by
bodily
pain
.
 
<EOS>
The
dear
little
fellow
,
having
recovered
his
animal
spirits
,
was
standing
upon
her
most
tender
foot
,
by
way
of
getting
his
face
(
which
looked
like
a
capital
O
in
a
red
-
lettered
play
-
bill
)
on
a
level
with
the
writing
-
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
Lavinia
will
be
a
parlour
boarder
,
"
continued
the
enviable
father
;
"
and
on
one
point
I
wish
my
directions
to
be
strictly
observed
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
that
some
ridiculous
love
affair
,
with
a
person
much
her
inferior
in
life
,
has
been
the
cause
of
her
present
state
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
that
of
course
,
under
your
care
,
she
can
have
no
opportunity
of
meeting
this
person
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
object
to
---
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
should
rather
prefer
---
<EOS>
her
mixing
with
such
society
as
you
see
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
important
statement
was
again
interrupted
by
the
high
-
spirited
little
creature
,
in
the
excess
of
his
joyousness
breaking
a
pane
of
glass
,
and
nearly
precipitating
himself
into
an
adjacent
area
.
<EOS>
James
was
rung
for
;
considerable
confusion
and
screaming
succeeded
;
two
little
blue
legs
were
seen
to
kick
violently
in
the
air
as
the
man
left
the
room
,
and
the
child
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Brook
Dingwall
would
like
Miss
Brook
Dingwall
to
learn
everything
,
"
said
Mrs
Brook
Dingwall
,
who
hardly
ever
said
anything
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
both
the
Miss
Crumptons
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
I
trust
the
plan
I
have
devised
will
be
effectual
in
weaning
my
daughter
from
this
absurd
idea
,
Miss
Crumpton
,
"
continued
the
legislator
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
comply
,
in
all
respects
,
with
any
request
I
may
forward
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
promise
was
of
course
made
;
and
after
a
lengthened
discussion
,
conducted
on
behalf
of
the
Dingwalls
with
the
most
becoming
diplomatic
gravity
,
and
on
that
of
the
Crumptons
with
profound
respect
,
it
was
finally
arranged
that
Miss
Lavinia
should
be
forwarded
to
Hammersmith
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
on
which
occasion
the
half
-
yearly
ball
given
at
the
establishment
was
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
It
might
divert
the
dear
girl
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
by
the
way
,
was
another
bit
of
diplomacy
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
was
introduced
to
her
future
governess
,
and
both
the
Miss
Crumptons
pronounced
her
"
a
most
charming
girl
;
"
an
opinion
which
,
by
a
singular
coincidence
,
they
always
entertained
of
any
new
pupil
.
   
<EOS>
Courtesies
were
exchanged
,
acknowledgments
expressed
,
condescension
exhibited
,
and
the
interview
terminated
.
   
<EOS>
Preparations
,
to
make
use
of
theatrical
phraseology
,
"
on
a
scale
of
magnitude
never
before
attempted
,
"
were
incessantly
made
at
Minerva
House
to
give
every
effect
to
the
forthcoming
ball
.
 
<EOS>
The
largest
room
in
the
house
was
pleasingly
ornamented
with
blue
calico
roses
,
plaid
tulips
,
and
other
equally
natural
-
looking
artificial
flowers
,
the
work
of
the
young
ladies
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
The
carpet
was
taken
up
,
the
folding
-
doors
were
taken
down
,
the
furniture
was
taken
out
,
and
rout
-
seats
were
taken
in
.
 
<EOS>
The
linen
-
drapers
of
Hammersmith
were
astounded
at
the
sudden
demand
for
blue
sarsenet
ribbon
,
and
long
white
gloves
.
 
<EOS>
Dozens
of
geraniums
were
purchased
for
bouquets
,
and
a
harp
and
two
violins
were
bespoke
from
town
,
in
addition
to
the
grand
piano
already
on
the
premises
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
who
were
selected
to
show
off
on
the
occasion
,
and
do
credit
to
the
establishment
,
practised
incessantly
,
much
to
their
own
satisfaction
,
and
greatly
to
the
annoyance
of
the
lame
old
gentleman
over
the
way
;
and
a
constant
correspondence
was
kept
up
,
between
the
Misses
Crumpton
and
the
Hammersmith
pastrycook
.
   
<EOS>
The
evening
came
;
and
then
there
was
such
a
lacing
of
stays
,
and
tying
of
sandals
,
and
dressing
of
hair
,
as
never
can
take
place
with
a
proper
degree
of
bustle
out
of
a
boarding
-
school
.
 
<EOS>
The
smaller
girls
managed
to
be
in
everybody
's
way
,
and
were
pushed
about
accordingly
;
and
the
elder
ones
dressed
,
and
tied
,
and
flattered
,
and
envied
,
one
another
,
as
earnestly
and
sincerely
as
if
they
had
actually
COME
OUT
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
look
,
dear
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Emily
Smithers
,
the
belle
of
the
house
,
of
Miss
Caroline
Wilson
,
who
was
her
bosom
friend
,
because
she
was
the
ugliest
girl
in
Hammersmith
,
or
out
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
charming
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Delightful
!
<EOS>
you
never
looked
so
handsome
,
"
returned
the
belle
,
adjusting
her
own
dress
,
and
not
bestowing
a
glance
on
her
poor
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
young
Hilton
will
come
early
,
"
said
another
young
lady
to
Miss
somebody
else
,
in
a
fever
of
expectation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
he
'd
be
highly
flattered
if
he
knew
it
,
"
returned
the
other
,
who
was
practising
L'ETE
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
's
so
handsome
,
"
said
the
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
Such
a
charming
person
!
"
added
a
second
.
   
<EOS>
"
Such
a
DISTINGUE
air
!
<EOS>
"
said
a
third
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
DO
you
think
?
"
said
another
girl
,
running
into
the
room
;
"
Miss
Crumpton
says
her
cousin
's
coming
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Theodosius
Butler
?
"
said
everybody
in
raptures
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
HE
handsome
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
a
novice
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
particularly
handsome
,
"
was
the
general
reply
;
"
but
,
oh
,
so
clever
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Theodosius
Butler
was
one
of
those
immortal
geniuses
who
are
to
be
met
with
in
almost
every
circle
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
,
usually
,
very
deep
,
monotonous
voices
.
 
<EOS>
They
always
persuade
themselves
that
they
are
wonderful
persons
,
and
that
they
ought
to
be
very
miserable
,
though
they
do
n't
precisely
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
very
conceited
,
and
usually
possess
half
an
idea
;
but
,
with
enthusiastic
young
ladies
,
and
silly
young
gentlemen
,
they
are
very
wonderful
persons
.
 
<EOS>
The
individual
in
question
,
Mr
Theodosius
,
had
written
a
pamphlet
containing
some
very
weighty
considerations
on
the
expediency
of
doing
something
or
other
;
and
as
every
sentence
contained
a
good
many
words
of
four
syllables
,
his
admirers
took
it
for
granted
that
he
meant
a
good
deal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
that
's
he
,
"
exclaimed
several
young
ladies
,
as
the
first
pull
of
the
evening
threatened
destruction
to
the
bell
of
the
gate
.
   
<EOS>
An
awful
pause
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
Some
boxes
arrived
and
a
young
lady
---
Miss
Brook
Dingwall
,
in
full
ball
costume
,
with
an
immense
gold
chain
round
her
neck
,
and
her
dress
looped
up
with
a
single
rose
;
an
ivory
fan
in
her
hand
,
and
a
most
interesting
expression
of
despair
in
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
The
Miss
Crumptons
inquired
after
the
family
,
with
the
most
excruciating
anxiety
,
and
Miss
Brook
Dingwall
was
formally
introduced
to
her
future
companions
.
 
<EOS>
The
Miss
Crumptons
conversed
with
the
young
ladies
in
the
most
mellifluous
tones
,
in
order
that
Miss
Brook
Dingwall
might
be
properly
impressed
with
their
amiable
treatment
.
   
<EOS>
Another
pull
at
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dadson
the
writing
-
master
,
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
The
wife
in
green
silk
,
with
shoes
and
cap
-
trimmings
to
correspond
:
 
the
writing
-
master
in
a
white
waistcoat
,
black
knee
-
shorts
,
and
ditto
silk
stockings
,
displaying
a
leg
large
enough
for
two
writing
-
masters
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
whispered
one
another
,
and
the
writing
-
master
and
his
wife
flattered
the
Miss
Crumptons
,
who
were
dressed
in
amber
,
with
long
sashes
,
like
dolls
.
   
<EOS>
Repeated
pulls
at
the
bell
,
and
arrivals
too
numerous
to
particularise
:
 
papas
and
mammas
,
and
aunts
and
uncles
,
the
owners
and
guardians
of
the
different
pupils
;
the
singing
-
master
,
Signor
Lobskini
,
in
a
black
wig
;
the
piano
-
forte
player
and
the
violins
;
the
harp
,
in
a
state
of
intoxication
;
and
some
twenty
young
men
,
who
stood
near
the
door
,
and
talked
to
one
another
,
occasionally
bursting
into
a
giggle
.
 
<EOS>
A
general
hum
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Coffee
handed
round
,
and
plentifully
partaken
of
by
fat
mammas
,
who
looked
like
the
stout
people
who
come
on
in
pantomimes
for
the
sole
purpose
of
being
knocked
down
.
   
<EOS>
The
popular
Mr
Hilton
was
the
next
arrival
;
and
he
having
,
at
the
request
of
the
Miss
Crumptons
,
undertaken
the
office
of
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
the
quadrilles
commenced
with
considerable
spirit
.
<EOS>
The
young
men
by
the
door
gradually
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
in
time
became
sufficiently
at
ease
to
consent
to
be
introduced
to
partners
.
 
<EOS>
The
writing
-
master
danced
every
set
,
springing
about
with
the
most
fearful
agility
,
and
his
wife
played
a
rubber
in
the
back
-
parlour
---
a
little
room
with
five
book
-
shelves
,
dignified
by
the
name
of
the
study
.
 
<EOS>
Setting
her
down
to
whist
was
a
half
-
yearly
piece
of
generalship
on
the
part
of
the
Miss
Crumptons
;
it
was
necessary
to
hide
her
somewhere
,
on
account
of
her
being
a
fright
.
   
<EOS>
The
interesting
Lavinia
Brook
Dingwall
was
the
only
girl
present
,
who
appeared
to
take
no
interest
in
the
proceedings
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
In
vain
was
she
solicited
to
dance
;
in
vain
was
the
universal
homage
paid
to
her
as
the
daughter
of
a
member
of
parliament
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
equally
unmoved
by
the
splendid
tenor
of
the
inimitable
Lobskini
,
and
the
brilliant
execution
of
Miss
Laetitia
Parsons
,
whose
performance
of
"
The
Recollections
of
Ireland
"
was
universally
declared
to
be
almost
equal
to
that
of
Moscheles
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Not
even
the
announcement
of
the
arrival
of
Mr
Theodosius
Butler
could
induce
her
to
leave
the
corner
of
the
back
drawing
-
room
in
which
she
was
seated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Theodosius
,
"
said
Miss
Maria
Crumpton
,
after
that
enlightened
pamphleteer
had
nearly
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
whole
company
,
"
I
must
introduce
you
to
our
new
pupil
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Theodosius
looked
as
if
he
cared
for
nothing
earthly
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
the
daughter
of
a
member
of
parliament
,
"
said
Maria
.
<EOS>
---
Theodosius
started
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
her
name
is
---
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Brook
Dingwall
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Great
Heaven
!
"
poetically
exclaimed
Theodosius
,
in
a
low
tone
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Crumpton
commenced
the
introduction
in
due
form
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Brook
Dingwall
languidly
raised
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Edward
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
with
a
half
-
shriek
,
on
seeing
the
well
-
known
nankeen
legs
.
   
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
as
Miss
Maria
Crumpton
possessed
no
remarkable
share
of
penetration
,
and
as
it
was
one
of
the
diplomatic
arrangements
that
no
attention
was
to
be
paid
to
Miss
Lavinia
's
incoherent
exclamations
,
she
was
perfectly
unconscious
of
the
mutual
agitation
of
the
parties
;
and
therefore
,
seeing
that
the
offer
of
his
hand
for
the
next
quadrille
was
accepted
,
she
left
him
by
the
side
of
Miss
Brook
Dingwall
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Edward
!
"
exclaimed
that
most
romantic
of
all
romantic
young
ladies
,
as
the
light
of
science
seated
himself
beside
her
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Edward
,
is
it
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Theodosius
assured
the
dear
creature
,
in
the
most
impassioned
manner
,
that
he
was
not
conscious
of
being
anybody
but
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
---
why
---
this
disguise
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Edward
M'Neville
Walter
,
what
have
I
not
suffered
on
your
account
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lavinia
,
hear
me
,
"
replied
the
hero
,
in
his
most
poetic
strain
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
condemn
me
unheard
.
 
<EOS>
If
anything
that
emanates
from
the
soul
of
such
a
wretch
as
I
,
can
occupy
a
place
in
your
recollection
---
if
any
being
,
so
vile
,
deserve
your
notice
---
you
may
remember
that
I
once
published
a
pamphlet
(
and
paid
for
its
publication
)
<EOS>
entitled
"
Considerations
on
the
Policy
of
Removing
the
Duty
on
Bees'-wax
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
do
---
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
sobbed
Lavinia
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
continued
the
lover
,
"
was
a
subject
to
which
your
father
was
devoted
heart
and
soul
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
---
he
was
!
"
reiterated
the
sentimentalist
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
,
"
continued
Theodosius
,
tragically
;
"
I
knew
it
---
<EOS>
I
forwarded
him
a
copy
.
 
<EOS>
He
wished
to
know
me
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
disclose
my
real
name
?
 
<EOS>
Never
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
assumed
that
name
which
you
have
so
often
pronounced
in
tones
of
endearment
.
 
<EOS>
As
M'Neville
Walter
,
I
devoted
myself
to
the
stirring
cause
;
as
M'Neville
Walter
I
gained
your
heart
;
in
the
same
character
I
was
ejected
from
your
house
by
your
father
's
domestics
;
and
in
no
character
at
all
have
I
since
been
enabled
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
now
meet
again
,
and
I
proudly
own
that
I
am
---
Theodosius
Butler
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
lady
appeared
perfectly
satisfied
with
this
argumentative
address
,
and
bestowed
a
look
of
the
most
ardent
affection
on
the
immortal
advocate
of
bees'-wax
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
hope
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
the
promise
your
father
's
violent
behaviour
interrupted
,
may
be
renewed
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
join
this
set
,
"
replied
Lavinia
,
coquettishly
---
for
girls
of
nineteen
CAN
coquette
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
ejaculated
he
of
the
nankeens
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
stir
not
from
this
spot
,
writhing
under
this
torture
of
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
---
may
I
---
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
promise
is
renewed
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
your
permission
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
fullest
extent
?
"
   
"
You
know
it
,
"
returned
the
blushing
Lavinia
.
 
<EOS>
The
contortions
of
the
interesting
Butler
's
visage
expressed
his
raptures
.
   
<EOS>
We
could
dilate
upon
the
occurrences
that
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
How
Mr
Theodosius
and
Miss
Lavinia
danced
,
and
talked
,
and
sighed
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
---
how
the
Miss
Crumptons
were
delighted
thereat
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
writing
-
master
continued
to
frisk
about
with
one
-
horse
power
,
and
how
his
wife
,
from
some
unaccountable
freak
,
left
the
whist
-
table
in
the
little
back
-
parlour
,
and
persisted
in
displaying
her
green
head
-
dress
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
supper
consisted
of
small
triangular
sandwiches
in
trays
,
and
a
tart
here
and
there
by
way
of
variety
;
and
how
the
visitors
consumed
warm
water
disguised
with
lemon
,
and
dotted
with
nutmeg
,
under
the
denomination
of
negus
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
and
other
matters
of
as
much
interest
<EOS>
,
however
,
we
pass
over
,
for
the
purpose
of
describing
a
scene
of
even
more
importance
.
   
<EOS>
A
fortnight
after
the
date
of
the
ball
,
Cornelius
Brook
Dingwall
,
Esq
,
MP
,
was
seated
at
the
same
library
-
table
,
and
in
the
same
room
,
as
we
have
before
described
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
alone
,
and
his
face
bore
an
expression
of
deep
thought
and
solemn
gravity
---
he
was
drawing
up
"
A
Bill
for
the
better
observance
of
Easter
Monday
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
footman
tapped
at
the
door
---
the
legislator
started
from
his
reverie
,
and
"
Miss
Crumpton
"
was
announced
.
 
<EOS>
Permission
was
given
for
Miss
Crumpton
to
enter
the
SANCTUM
;
Maria
came
sliding
in
,
and
having
taken
her
seat
with
a
due
portion
of
affectation
,
the
footman
retired
,
and
the
governess
was
left
alone
with
the
MP
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
she
longed
for
the
presence
of
a
third
party
!
 
<EOS>
Even
the
facetious
young
gentleman
would
have
been
a
relief
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Crumpton
began
the
duet
.
 
<EOS>
She
hoped
Mrs
Brook
Dingwall
and
the
handsome
little
boy
were
in
good
health
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Brook
Dingwall
and
little
Frederick
were
at
Brighton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Much
obliged
to
you
,
Miss
Crumpton
,
"
said
Cornelius
,
in
his
most
dignified
manner
,
"
for
your
attention
in
calling
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
driven
down
to
Hammersmith
,
to
see
Lavinia
,
but
your
account
was
so
very
satisfactory
,
and
my
duties
in
the
House
occupy
me
so
much
,
that
I
determined
to
postpone
it
for
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
How
has
she
gone
on
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
indeed
,
sir
,
"
returned
Maria
,
dreading
to
inform
the
father
that
she
had
gone
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
I
thought
the
plan
on
which
I
proceeded
would
be
a
match
for
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
was
a
favourable
opportunity
to
say
that
somebody
else
had
been
a
match
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
unfortunate
governess
was
unequal
to
the
task
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
persevered
strictly
in
the
line
of
conduct
I
prescribed
,
Miss
Crumpton
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Strictly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
in
your
note
that
her
spirits
gradually
improved
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
indeed
,
sir
.
"
   
"
To
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
convinced
they
would
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
fear
,
sir
,
"
said
Miss
Crumpton
,
with
visible
emotion
<EOS>
,
"
I
fear
the
plan
has
not
succeeded
,
quite
so
well
as
we
could
have
wished
.
"
   
<EOS>
No
!
"
exclaimed
the
prophet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Crumpton
,
you
look
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
What
has
happened
?
"
   
"
Miss
Brook
Dingwall
,
sir
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
?
"
   
"
Has
gone
,
sir
"
---
said
Maria
,
exhibiting
a
strong
inclination
to
faint
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Eloped

sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
Eloped

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Who

<EOS>
when

where

how

"
almost
shrieked
the
agitated
diplomatist
.
   
<EOS>
The
natural
yellow
of
the
unfortunate
Maria
's
face
changed
to
all
the
hues
of
the
rainbow
,
as
she
laid
a
small
packet
on
the
member
's
table
.
   
<EOS>
He
hurriedly
opened
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
letter
from
his
daughter
,
and
another
from
Theodosius
.
 
<EOS>
He
glanced
over
their
contents
---
"
Ere
this

you
,
far
distant
---
appeal
to
feelings
---
love
to
distraction
---
bees'-wax
---
slavery

"
&
c

<EOS>
He
dashed
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
and
paced
the
room
with
fearfully
long
strides
,
to
the
great
alarm
of
the
precise
Maria
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
mind
;
from
this
time
forward
,
"
said
Mr
Brook
Dingwall
,
suddenly
stopping
at
the
table
,
and
beating
time
upon
it
with
his
hand
;
"
from
this
time
forward
,
I
never
will
,
under
any
circumstances
whatever
,
permit
a
man
who
writes
pamphlets
to
enter
any
other
room
of
this
house
but
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
---
I
'll
allow
my
daughter
and
her
husband
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a

year
,
and
never
see
their
faces
again
:
 
and
,
damme
!
<EOS>
ma'am
,
I
'll
bring
in
a
bill
for
the
abolition
of
finishing

schools

"
   
<EOS>
Some
time
has
elapsed
since
this
passionate
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Butler
are
at
present
rusticating
in
a
small
cottage
at
Ball's
-
pond
,
pleasantly
situated
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
a
brick
-
field
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
family

<EOS>
Mr
Theodosius
looks
very
important
,
and
writes
incessantly
;
but
,
in
consequence
of
a
gross
combination
on
the
part
of
publishers
,
none
of
his
productions
appear
in
print
.
 
<EOS>
His
young
wife
begins
to
think
that
ideal
misery
is
preferable
to
real
unhappiness
;
and
that
a
marriage
,
contracted
in
haste
,
and
repented
at
leisure
,
is
the
cause
of
more
substantial
wretchedness
than
she
ever
anticipated
.
   
<EOS>
On
cool
reflection
,
Cornelius
Brook
Dingwall
,
Esq
,
MP
,
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
admit
that
the
untoward
result
of
his
admirable
arrangements
was
attributable
,
not
to
the
Miss
Crumptons
,
but
his
own
diplomacy
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
consoles
himself
,
like
some
other
small
diplomatists
,
by
satisfactorily
proving
that
if
his
plans
did
not
succeed
,
they
ought
to
have
done
so
.
 
<EOS>
Minerva
House

IN

The
Tuggses
at
Ramsgate
Once
upon
a
time
there
dwelt
,
in
a
narrow
street
on
the
Surrey
side
of
the
water
,
within
three
minutes
'
walk
of
old
London
Bridge
,
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
---
a
little
dark
-
faced
man
,
with
shiny
hair
,
twinkling
eyes
,
short
legs
,
and
a
body
of
very
considerable
thickness
,
measuring
from
the
centre
button
of
his
waistcoat
in
front
,
to
the
ornamental
buttons
of
his
coat
behind
.
 
<EOS>
The
figure
of
the
amiable
Mrs
Tuggs
,
if
not
perfectly
symmetrical
,
was
decidedly
comfortable
;
and
the
form
of
her
only
daughter
,
the
accomplished
Miss
Charlotte
Tuggs
,
was
fast
ripening
into
that
state
of
luxuriant
plumpness
which
had
enchanted
the
eyes
,
and
captivated
the
heart
,
of
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
in
his
earlier
days
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Simon
Tuggs
,
his
only
son
,
and
Miss
Charlotte
Tuggs
's
only
brother
,
was
as
differently
formed
in
body
,
as
he
was
differently
constituted
in
mind
,
from
the
remainder
of
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
that
elongation
in
his
thoughtful
face
,
and
that
tendency
to
weakness
in
his
interesting
legs
,
which
tell
so
forcibly
of
a
great
mind
and
romantic
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
The
slightest
traits
of
character
in
such
a
being
,
possess
no
mean
interest
to
speculative
minds
.
 
<EOS>
He
usually
appeared
in
public
,
in
capacious
shoes
with
black
cotton
stockings
;
and
was
observed
to
be
particularly
attached
to
a
black
glazed
stock
,
without
tie
or
ornament
of
any
description
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
perhaps
no
profession
,
however
useful
;
no
pursuit
,
however
meritorious
;
which
can
escape
the
petty
attacks
of
vulgar
minds
.
<EOS>
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
was
a
grocer
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
be
supposed
that
a
grocer
was
beyond
the
breath
of
calumny
;
but
no
---
the
neighbours
stigmatised
him
as
a
chandler
;
and
the
poisonous
voice
of
envy
distinctly
asserted
that
he
dispensed
tea
and
coffee
by
the
quartern
,
retailed
sugar
by
the
ounce
,
cheese
by
the
slice
,
tobacco
by
the
screw
,
and
butter
by
the
pat
.
 
<EOS>
These
taunts
,
however
,
were
lost
upon
the
Tuggses
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tuggs
attended
to
the
grocery
department
;
Mrs
Tuggs
to
the
cheesemongery
;
and
Miss
Tuggs
to
her
education
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Simon
Tuggs
kept
his
father
's
books
,
and
his
own
counsel
.
   
<EOS>
One
fine
spring
afternoon
,
the
latter
gentleman
was
seated
on
a
tub
of
weekly
Dorset
,
behind
the
little
red
desk
with
a
wooden
rail
,
which
ornamented
a
corner
of
the
counter
;
when
a
stranger
dismounted
from
a
cab
,
and
hastily
entered
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
black
cloth
,
and
bore
with
him
,
a
green
umbrella
,
and
a
blue
bag
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tuggs
?
"
said
the
stranger
,
inquiringly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
MY
name
is
Tuggs
,
"
replied
Mr
Simon
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
other
Mr
Tuggs
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
looking
towards
the
glass
door
which
led
into
the
parlour
behind
the
shop
,
and
on
the
inside
of
which
,
the
round
face
of
Mr
Tuggs
,
senior
,
was
distinctly
visible
,
peeping
over
the
curtain
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Simon
gracefully
waved
his
pen
,
as
if
in
intimation
of
his
wish
that
his
father
would
advance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
with
considerable
celerity
,
removed
his
face
from
the
curtain
and
placed
it
before
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
the
Temple
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
bag
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
the
Temple
!
"
said
Mrs
Tuggs
,
flinging
open
the
door
of
the
little
parlour
and
disclosing
Miss
Tuggs
in
perspective
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
the
Temple
!
"
said
Miss
Tuggs
and
Mr
Simon
Tuggs
at
the
same
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
the
Temple
!
"
said
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
turning
as
pale
as
a
Dutch
cheese
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
the
Temple
,
"
repeated
the
man
with
the
bag
;
"
from
Mr
Cower
's
,
the
solicitor
's
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tuggs
,
I
congratulate
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Ladies
,
I
wish
you
joy
of
your
prosperity
!
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
successful
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
man
with
the
bag
leisurely
divested
himself
of
his
umbrella
and
glove
,
as
a
preliminary
to
shaking
hands
with
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
Now
the
words
"
we
have
been
successful
,
"
had
no
sooner
issued
from
the
mouth
of
the
man
with
the
bag
,
than
Mr
Simon
Tuggs
rose
from
the
tub
of
weekly
Dorset
,
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
,
gasped
for
breath
,
made
figures
of
eight
in
the
air
with
his
pen
,
and
finally
fell
into
the
arms
of
his
anxious
mother
,
and
fainted
away
without
the
slightest
ostensible
cause
or
pretence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Water
!
"
screamed
Mrs
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
up
,
my
son
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Simon
!
<EOS>
dear
Simon
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Miss
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
better
now
,
"
said
Mr
Simon
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
successful
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
corroborative
evidence
of
his
being
better
,
he
fainted
away
again
,
and
was
borne
into
the
little
parlour
by
the
united
efforts
of
the
remainder
of
the
family
,
and
the
man
with
the
bag
.
   
<EOS>
To
a
casual
spectator
,
or
to
any
one
unacquainted
with
the
position
of
the
family
,
this
fainting
would
have
been
unaccountable
.
 
<EOS>
To
those
who
understood
the
mission
of
the
man
with
the
bag
,
and
were
moreover
acquainted
with
the
excitability
of
the
nerves
of
Mr
Simon
Tuggs
,
it
was
quite
comprehensible
.
 
<EOS>
A
long
-
pending
lawsuit
respecting
the
validity
of
a
will
,
had
been
unexpectedly
decided
;
and
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
was
the
possessor
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
   
<EOS>
A
prolonged
consultation
took
place
,
that
night
,
in
the
little
parlour
---
a
consultation
that
was
to
settle
the
future
destinies
of
the
Tuggses
.
 
<EOS>
The
shop
was
shut
up
,
at
an
unusually
early
hour
;
and
many
were
the
unavailing
kicks
bestowed
upon
the
closed
door
by
applicants
for
quarterns
of
sugar
,
or
half
-
quarterns
of
bread
,
or
penn'orths
of
pepper
,
which
were
to
have
been
"
left
till
Saturday
,
"
but
which
fortune
had
decreed
were
to
be
left
alone
altogether
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
certainly
give
up
business
,
"
said
Miss
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
decidedly
,
"
said
Mrs
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Simon
shall
go
to
the
bar
,
"
said
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
shall
always
sign
myself
"
Cymon
"
in
future
,
"
said
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
shall
call
myself
Charlotta
,
"
said
Miss
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
must
always
call
ME
"
Ma
,
"
and
father
"
Pa
,
"
"
said
Mrs
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
Pa
must
leave
off
all
his
vulgar
habits
,
"
interposed
Miss
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
of
all
that
,
"
responded
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
complacently
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
at
that
very
moment
,
eating
pickled
salmon
with
a
pocket
-
knife
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
leave
town
immediately
,
"
said
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
Everybody
concurred
that
this
was
an
indispensable
preliminary
to
being
genteel
.
 
<EOS>
The
question
then
arose
,
Where
should
they
go
?
   
<EOS>
"
Gravesend
?
"
<EOS>
mildly
suggested
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
was
unanimously
scouted
.
 
<EOS>
Gravesend
was
LOW
.
   
<EOS>
"
Margate
?
"
insinuated
Mrs
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
Worse
and
worse
<EOS>
---
nobody
there
,
but
tradespeople
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brighton
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
opposed
an
insurmountable
objection
.
<EOS>
All
the
coaches
had
been
upset
,
in
turn
,
within
the
last
three
weeks
;
each
coach
had
averaged
two
passengers
killed
,
and
six
wounded
;
and
,
in
every
case
,
the
newspapers
had
distinctly
understood
that
"
no
blame
whatever
was
attributable
to
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ramsgate
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Cymon
,
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
;
how
stupid
they
must
have
been
,
not
to
have
thought
of
that
before
!
<EOS>
Ramsgate
was
just
the
place
of
all
others
.
   
<EOS>
Two
months
after
this
conversation
,
the
City
of
London
Ramsgate
steamer
was
running
gaily
down
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
Her
flag
was
flying
,
<EOS>
her
band
was
playing
,
her
passengers
were
conversing
;
everything
about
her
seemed
gay
and
lively
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
No
wonder
---
the
Tuggses
were
on
board
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charming

ai
n't

"
said
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
in
a
bottle
-
green
great

coat
,
with
a
velvet
collar
of
the
same

and
a
blue
travelling

cap
with
a
gold
band
.
   
<EOS>
"
Soul

"
replied
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
<EOS>
---
he
was
entered
at
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Soul

inspiring

"
   
<EOS>
"
Delightful

said
a
stoutish

military

looking
gentleman
in
a
blue
surtout
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
,
and
white
trousers
chained
down

soles

his
boots

<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
took
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
answering
the
observation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heavenly

he
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

enthusiastic
admirer

said
the

replied
Mr

Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
on
the
continent
,
of
course
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
military
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
"
replied
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
---
in
a
qualified
tone
,
as
if
he
wished
it
to
be
implied
that
he
had
gone
half
-
way
and
come
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
of
course
intend
your
son
to
make
the
grand
tour
,
sir
?
"
said
the
military
gentleman
,
addressing
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
did
not
precisely
understand
what
the
grand
tour
was
,
or
how
such
an
article
was
manufactured
,
he
replied
,
"
Of
course
.
"
 
<EOS>
Just
as
he
said
the
word
,
there
came
tripping
up
,
from
her
seat
at
the
stern
of
the
vessel
,
a
young
lady
in
a
puce
-
coloured
silk
cloak
,
and
boots
of
the
same
;
with
long
black
ringlets
,
large
black
eyes
,
brief
petticoats
,
and
unexceptionable
ankles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
young
lady
to
the
military
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Belinda
,
my
love
,
"
responded
the
military
gentleman
to
the
black
-
eyed
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
left
me
alone
so
long
for
?
"
said
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
stared
out
of
countenance
by
those
rude
young
men
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
stared
at
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
military
gentleman
,
with
an
emphasis
which
made
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
withdraw
his
eyes
from
the
young
lady
's
face
with
inconceivable
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Which
young
men
---
where
?
"
and
the
military
gentleman
clenched
his
fist
,
and
glared
fearfully
on
the
cigar
-
smokers
around
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
calm
,
Walter
,
I
entreat
,
"
said
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
,
"
said
the
military
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
,
sir
,
"
interposed
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
ai
n't
worth
your
notice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
<EOS>
---
no
---
they
are
not
,
indeed
,
"
urged
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
WILL
be
calm
,
"
said
the
military
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
speak
truly
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
a
timely
remonstrance
,
which
may
have
spared
me
the
guilt
of
manslaughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Calming
his
wrath
,
the
military
gentleman
wrung
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
by
the
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
sister
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
;
seeing
that
the
military
gentleman
was
casting
an
admiring
look
towards
Miss
Charlotta
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
wife
,
ma'am
---
Mrs
Captain
Waters
,
"
said
the
military
gentleman
,
presenting
the
black
-
eyed
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
mother
,
ma'am
---
Mrs
Tuggs
,
"
said
Mr
Cymon
.
 
<EOS>
The
military
gentleman
and
his
wife
murmured
enchanting
courtesies
;
and
the
Tuggses
looked
as
unembarrassed
as
they
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
black
-
eyed
young
lady
,
after
they
had
sat
chatting
with
the
Tuggses
some
half
-
hour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
love
,
"
said
the
military
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
this
gentleman
(
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
towards
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
)
is
very
much
like
the
Marquis
Carriwini
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
me
,
very
!
"
said
the
military
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
struck
me
,
the
moment
I
saw
him
,
"
said
the
young
lady
,
gazing
intently
,
and
with
a
melancholy
air
,
on
the
scarlet
countenance
of
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
looked
at
everybody
;
and
finding
that
everybody
was
looking
at
him
,
appeared
to
feel
some
temporary
difficulty
in
disposing
of
his
eyesight
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
exactly
the
air
of
the
marquis
,
"
said
the
military
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
extraordinary
!
<EOS>
"
sighed
the
military
gentleman
's
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
the
marquis
,
sir
?
"
inquired
the
military
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
stammered
a
negative
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
did
,
"
continued
Captain
Walter
Waters
,
"
you
would
feel
how
much
reason
you
have
to
be
proud
of
the
resemblance
---
a
most
elegant
man
,
with
a
most
prepossessing
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
---
he
is
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Belinda
Waters
energetically
.
 
<EOS>
As
her
eye
caught
that
of
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
,
she
withdrew
it
from
his
features
in
bashful
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
was
highly
gratifying
to
the
feelings
of
the
Tuggses
;
and
when
,
in
the
course
of
farther
conversation
,
it
was
discovered
that
Miss
Charlotta
Tuggs
was
the
FAC
SIMILE
of
a
titled
relative
of
Mrs
Belinda
Waters
,
and
that
Mrs
Tuggs
herself
was
the
very
picture
of
the
Dowager
Duchess
of
Dobbleton
,
their
delight
in
the
acquisition
of
so
genteel
and
friendly
an
acquaintance
,
knew
no
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
dignity
of
Captain
Walter
Waters
relaxed
,
to
that
degree
,
that
he
suffered
himself
to
be
prevailed
upon
by
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
to
partake
of
cold
pigeon
-
pie
and
sherry
,
on
deck
;
and
a
most
delightful
conversation
,
aided
by
these
agreeable
stimulants
,
was
prolonged
,
until
they
ran
alongside
Ramsgate
Pier
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
dear
!
"
said
Mrs
Captain
Waters
to
Miss
Charlotta
Tuggs
,
just
before
the
bustle
of
landing
commenced
;
"
we
shall
see
you
on
the
sands
in
the
morning
;
and
,
as
we
are
sure
to
have
found
lodgings
before
then
,
I
hope
we
shall
be
inseparables
for
many
weeks
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
hope
so
,
"
said
Miss
Charlotta
Tuggs
,
emphatically
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tickets
,
ladies
and
gen'lm'n
,
"
said
the
man
on
the
paddle
-
box
.
   
<EOS>
"
Want
a
porter
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
a
dozen
men
in
smock
-
frocks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
!
"
said
Captain
Waters
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Captain
Waters
---
"
good
-
bye
,
Mr
Cymon
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
a
pressure
of
the
hand
which
threw
the
amiable
young
man
's
nerves
into
a
state
of
considerable
derangement
,
Mrs
Captain
Waters
disappeared
among
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
A
pair
of
puce
-
coloured
boots
were
seen
ascending
the
steps
,
a
white
handkerchief
fluttered
,
a
black
eye
gleamed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Waterses
were
gone
,
and
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
was
alone
in
a
heartless
world
.
   
<EOS>
Silently
and
abstractedly
,
did
that
too
sensitive
youth
follow
his
revered
parents
,
and
a
train
of
smock
-
frocks
and
wheelbarrows
,
along
the
pier
,
until
the
bustle
of
the
scene
around
,
recalled
him
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
was
shining
brightly
;
the
sea
,
dancing
to
its
own
music
,
rolled
merrily
in
;
crowds
of
people
promenaded
to
and
fro
;
young
ladies
tittered
;
old
ladies
talked
;
nursemaids
displayed
their
charms
to
the
greatest
possible
advantage
;
and
their
little
charges
ran
up
and
down
,
and
to
and
fro
,
and
in
and
out
,
under
the
feet
,
and
between
the
legs
,
of
the
assembled
concourse
,
in
the
most
playful
and
exhilarating
manner
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
old
gentlemen
,
trying
to
make
out
objects
through
long
telescopes
;
and
young
ones
,
making
objects
of
themselves
in
open
shirt
-
collars
;
ladies
,
carrying
about
portable
chairs
,
and
portable
chairs
carrying
about
invalids
;
parties
,
waiting
on
the
pier
for
parties
who
had
come
by
the
steam
-
boat
;
and
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
talking
,
laughing
,
welcoming
,
and
merriment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fly
,
sir
?
"
exclaimed
a
chorus
of
fourteen
men
and
six
boys
,
the
moment
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
at
the
head
of
his
little
party
,
set
foot
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
gen'lm'n

<EOS>
said
one
,
touching
his
hat
with
mock
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
"

"

"
shouted
another
aspiring
charioteer
,
mounting
the
box
,
and
inducing
an
old
grey
horse
to
indulge
in
some
imperfect
reminiscences
of
a
canter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look

<EOS>
---
temper

<EOS>
Resisting
even
the
temptation
of
securing
the
services
of
so
valuable
a
quadruped
as
the
last
named
,
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
beckoned
to
the
proprietor
of
a
dingy
conveyance
of
a
greenish
hue
,
lined
with
faded
striped
calico
;
and
,
the
luggage
and
the
family
having
been
deposited
therein
,
the
animal
in
the
shafts
,
after
describing
circles
in
the
road
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
last
consented
to
depart
in
quest
of
lodgings
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
many
beds
have
you
got
?
"
screamed
Mrs
Tuggs
out
of
the
fly
,
to
the
woman
who
opened
the
door
of
the
first
house
which
displayed
a
bill
intimating
that
apartments
were
to
be
let
within
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
many
did
you
want
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
was
,
of
course
,
the
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Three

"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
step
in

ma'am

"
 
<EOS>
Down
got
Mrs
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
were
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
Splendid
view
of
the
sea
from
the
front
windows
 
---
charming

<EOS>
A
short
pause
.
 
<EOS>
Back
came
Mrs
Tuggs
again
.
<EOS>
---
One
parlour
and
a
mattress
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
the
devil
did
n't
they
say
so
at
first
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
rather
pettishly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do

"
said
Mrs
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wretches

<EOS>
exclaimed
the
nervous
Cymon
.
 
<EOS>
Another
bill

another
stoppage
.
 
<EOS>
Same
question

same
answer
---
similar
result

<EOS>
"
What
do

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
thoroughly
out
of
temper

<EOS>
"
Do

said
the
placid
Mrs
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Orvis

<EOS>

"
said
the
driver
,
by
way
of
accounting
for
the
circumstance
in
a
satisfactory
manner
;
and
off
they
went
again
,
to
make
fresh
inquiries
,
and
encounter
fresh
disappointments
.
   
<EOS>
It
had
grown
dusk
when
the
"
fly
"
---
the
rate
of
whose
progress
greatly
belied
its
name
---
after
climbing
up
four
or
five
perpendicular
hills
,
stopped
before
the
door
of
a
dusty
house
,
with
a
bay
window
,
from
which
you
could
obtain
a
beautiful
glimpse
of
the
sea
---
if
you
thrust
half
of
your
body
out
of
it
,
at
the
imminent
peril
of
falling
into
the
area
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tuggs
alighted
.
 
<EOS>
One

floor
sitting

three
cells
with

A

Family
on

<EOS>
Five
children
milk

and
one
little
boy
,
expelled
for
bad
behaviour
,
screaming
on
his
back
in
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
terms
?
"
said
Mrs
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
The
mistress
of
the
house
was
considering
the
expediency
of
putting
on
an
extra
guinea
;
so
,
she
coughed
slightly
,
and
affected
not
to
hear
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
terms
?
"
said
Mrs
Tuggs
,
in
a
louder
key
.
   
<EOS>
"
Five
guineas
a
week

ma'am
,
WITH
attendance

"
replied
the
lodging
-
house
keeper
.
 
<EOS>
(
Attendance
means
the
privilege
of
ringing
the
bell
as
often
as
you
like

for
your
own
amusement

<EOS>
"
Rather
dear

"
said
Mrs
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no

ma'am

"
replied
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
with
a
benign
smile
of
pity
at
the
ignorance
of
manners
and
customs
,
which
the
observation
betrayed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
cheap
!
"
   
<EOS>
Such
an
authority
was
indisputable
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tuggs
paid
a
week
's
rent
in
advance
,
and
took
the
lodgings
for
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
hour

time
,
the
family
were
seated
at
tea
in
their
new
abode

<EOS>
"
Capital

said
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
eyed
his
father
with
a
rebellious
scowl
,
as
he
emphatically
said
"
SHRIMPS

<EOS>
"
Well

Mr

There
was
pity

blended
with
malignity

in
Mr
Cymon

eye

as
he
replied
,
"
Do

<EOS>
What

heard
such

Or

ejaculated
Mr

with
a

,
is
she
not
,
Cymon
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Charlotta
.
   
<EOS>
A
glow
of
nervous
excitement
passed
over
the
countenance
of
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
,
as
he
replied
,
"
An
angel
of
beauty
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
said
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hallo
,
Cymon
,
my
boy
,
take
care
.
<EOS>
Married
lady
,
you
know
;
"
and
he
winked
one
of
his
twinkling
eyes
knowingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
exclaimed
Cymon
,
starting
up
with
an
ebullition
of
fury
,
as
unexpected
as
alarming
,
"
why
am
I
to
be
reminded
of
that
blight
of
my
happiness
,
and
ruin
of
my
hopes
?
 
<EOS>
Why
am
I
to
be
taunted
with
the
miseries
which
are
heaped
upon
my
head
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
enough
to
---
to
---
to
---
"
and
the
orator
paused
;
but
whether
for
want
of
words
,
or
lack
of
breath
,
was
never
distinctly
ascertained
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
impressive
solemnity
in
the
tone
of
this
address
,
and
in
the
air
with
which
the
romantic
Cymon
,
at
its
conclusion
,
rang
the
bell
,
and
demanded
a
flat
candlestick
,
which
effectually
forbade
a
reply
.
 
<EOS>
He
stalked
dramatically
to
bed
,
and
the
Tuggses
went
to
bed
too
,
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
in
a
state
of
considerable
mystification
and
perplexity
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
pier
had
presented
a
scene
of
life
and
bustle
to
the
Tuggses
on
their
first
landing
at
Ramsgate
,
it
was
far
surpassed
by
the
appearance
of
the
sands
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
,
bright
,
clear
day
,
with
a
light
breeze
from
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
same
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
the
same
children
,
the
same
nursemaids
,
the
same
telescopes
,
the
same
portable
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
were
employed
in
needlework
,
or
watch
-
guard
making
,
or
knitting
,
or
reading
novels
;
the
gentlemen
were
reading
newspapers
and
magazines
;
the
children
were
digging
holes
in
the
sand
with
wooden
spades
,
and
collecting
water
therein
;
the
nursemaids
,
with
their
youngest
charges
in
their
arms
,
were
running
in
after
the
waves
,
and
then
running
back
with
the
waves
after
them
;
and
,
now
and
then
,
a
little
sailing
-
boat
either
departed
with
a
gay
and
talkative
cargo
of
passengers
,
or
returned
with
a
very
silent
and
particularly
uncomfortable
-
looking
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
never
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Tuggs
,
as
she
and
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
and
Miss
Charlotta
Tuggs
,
and
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
,
with
their
eight
feet
in
a
corresponding
number
of
yellow
shoes
,
seated
themselves
on
four
rush
-
bottomed
chairs
,
which
,
being
placed
in
a
soft
part
of
the
sand
,
<EOS>
forthwith
sunk
down
some
two
feet
and
a
half
---
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
never
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
,
by
an
exertion
of
great
personal
strength
,
uprooted
the
chairs
,
and
removed
them
further
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'm
blessed
if
there
ai
n't
some
ladies
a
-
going
in
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
with
intense
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
pa
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Charlotta
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
IS
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
sure
enough
,
four
young
ladies
,
each
furnished
with
a
towel
,
tripped
up
the
steps
of
a
bathing
-
machine
.
 
<EOS>
In
went
the
horse
,
floundering
about
in
the
water
;
round
turned
the
machine
;
down
sat
the
driver
;
and
presently
out
burst
the
young
ladies
aforesaid
,
with
four
distinct
splashes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
's
sing'ler
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
,
after
an
awkward
pause
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
coughed
slightly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
here
's
some
gentlemen
a
-
going
in
on
this
side
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs
Tuggs
,
in
a
tone
of
horror
.
   
<EOS>
Three
machines
---
three
horses
---
three
flounderings
---
three
turnings
round
---
three
splashes
---
three
gentlemen
,
disporting
themselves
in
the
water
like
so
many
dolphins
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
THAT
'S
sing'ler
!
"
said
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
again
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Charlotta
coughed
this
time
,
and
another
pause
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
agreeably
broken
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
,
dear
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
looking
for
you
,
all
the
morning
,
"
said
a
voice
to
Miss
Charlotta
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Captain
Waters
was
the
owner
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
?
"
said
Captain
Walter
Waters
,
all
suavity
;
and
a
most
cordial
interchange
of
greetings
ensued
.
   
<EOS>
"
Belinda
,
my
love
,
"
said
Captain
Walter
Waters
,
applying
his
glass
to
his
eye
,
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Mrs
Captain
Waters
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
Harry
Thompson
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
said
Belinda
,
applying
her
glass
to
her
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bathing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
so
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
He
do
n't
see
us
,
does
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
think
he
does
"
replied
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
,
how
very
singular
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
inquired
Belinda
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
Mary
Golding
,
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
---
<EOS>
where
?
"
 
<EOS>
(
Up
went
the
glass
again
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
the
captain
,
pointing
to
one
of
the
young
ladies
before
noticed
,
who
,
in
her
bathing
costume
,
looked
as
if
she
was
enveloped
in
a
patent
Mackintosh
,
of
scanty
dimensions
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
it
is
,
I
declare
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs
Captain
Waters
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
very
curious
we
should
see
them
both
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
the
captain
,
with
perfect
coolness
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
reg'lar
thing
here
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
"
whispered
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
to
his
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
is
,
"
whispered
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
in
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Queer
,
though
---
ai
n't
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
nodded
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
doing
with
yourself
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
lunch
at
Pegwell
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
that
very
much
indeed
,
"
interposed
Mrs
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
never
heard
of
Pegwell
;
but
the
word
"
lunch
"
had
reached
her
ears
,
and
it
sounded
very
agreeably
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
shall
we
go
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
captain
;
"
it
's
too
warm
to
walk
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
shay
?
"
suggested
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Chaise
,
"
whispered
Mr
Cymon
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
one
would
be
enough
,
"
said
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
aloud
,
quite
unconscious
of
the
meaning
of
the
correction
.
 
<EOS>
"
However
,
two
shays
if
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
a
donkey
SO
much
,
"
said
Belinda
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
so
should
I
!
"
echoed
Charlotta
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
can
have
a
fly
,
"
suggested
the
captain
,
"
and
you
can
have
a
couple
of
donkeys
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
A
fresh
difficulty
arose
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Captain
Waters
declared
it
would
be
decidedly
improper
for
two
ladies
to
ride
alone
.
 
<EOS>
The
remedy
was
obvious
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
young
Mr
Tuggs
would
be
gallant
enough
to
accompany
them
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
blushed
,
smiled
,
looked
vacant
,
and
faintly
protested
that
he
was
no
horseman
.
 
<EOS>
The
objection
was
at
once
overruled
.
 
<EOS>
A
fly
was
speedily
found
;
and
three
donkeys
---
which
the
proprietor
declared
on
his
solemn
asseveration
to
be
"
three
parts
blood
,
and
the
other
corn
"
---
were
engaged
in
the
service
.
   
<EOS>
"
Kim
up
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
one
of
the
two
boys
who
followed
behind
,
to
propel
the
donkeys
,
when
Belinda
Waters
and
Charlotta
Tuggs
had
been
hoisted
,
and
pushed
,
and
pulled
,
into
their
respective
saddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hi
---
hi
---
hi
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
other
boy
behind
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
Away
went
the
donkey
,
with
the
stirrups
jingling
against
the
heels
of
Cymon
's
boots
,
and
Cymon
's
boots
nearly
scraping
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Way
---
way
!
 
<EOS>
Wo
---
o
---
<EOS>
o
---
!
"
cried
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
as
well
as
he
could
,
in
the
midst
of
the
jolting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
make
it
gallop
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Mrs
Captain
Waters
,
behind
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
donkey
WILL
go
into
the
public
-
house
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Miss
Tuggs
in
the
rear
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hi
---
hi
---
hi
!
"
groaned
both
the
boys
together
;
and
on
went
the
donkeys
as
if
nothing
would
ever
stop
them
.
   
<EOS>
Everything
has
an
end
,
however
;
even
the
galloping
of
donkeys
will
cease
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
animal
which
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
bestrode
,
feeling
sundry
uncomfortable
tugs
at
the
bit
,
the
intent
of
which
he
could
by
no
means
divine
,
abruptly
sidled
against
a
brick
wall
,
and
expressed
his
uneasiness
by
grinding
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
's
leg
on
the
rough
surface
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Captain
Waters
's
donkey
,
apparently
under
the
influence
of
some
playfulness
of
spirit
,
rushed
suddenly
,
head
first
,
into
a
hedge
,
and
declined
to
come
out
again
:
 
and
the
quadruped
on
which
Miss
Tuggs
was
mounted
,
expressed
his
delight
at
this
humorous
proceeding
by
firmly
planting
his
fore
-
feet
against
the
ground
,
and
kicking
up
his
hind
-
legs
in
a
very
agile
,
but
somewhat
alarming
manner
.
   
<EOS>
This
abrupt
termination
to
the
rapidity
of
the
ride
,
naturally
occasioned
some
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
Both
the
ladies
indulged
in
vehement
screaming
for
several
minutes
;
and
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
,
besides
sustaining
intense
bodily
pain
,
had
the
additional
mental
anguish
of
witnessing
their
distressing
situation
,
without
having
the
power
to
rescue
them
,
by
reason
of
his
leg
being
firmly
screwed
in
between
the
animal
and
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
The
efforts
of
the
boys
,
however
,
assisted
by
the
ingenious
expedient
of
twisting
the
tail
of
the
most
rebellious
donkey
,
restored
order
in
a
much
shorter
time
than
could
have
reasonably
been
expected
,
and
the
little
party
jogged
slowly
on
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
let
'em
walk
,
"
said
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
cruel
to
overdrive
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Werry
well
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
boy
,
with
a
grin
at
his
companion
,
as
if
he
understood
Mr
Cymon
to
mean
that
the
cruelty
applied
less
to
the
animals
than
to
their
riders
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
lovely
day
,
dear
!
"
said
Charlotta
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charming
;
enchanting
,
dear
!
"
responded
Mrs
Captain
Waters
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
beautiful
prospect
,
Mr
Tuggs
!
"
   
Cymon
looked
full
in
Belinda
's
face
,
as
he
responded
---
"
Beautiful
,
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
lady
cast
down
her
eyes
,
and
suffered
the
animal
she
was
riding
to
fall
a
little
back
.
 
<EOS>
Cymon
Tuggs
instinctively
did
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
brief
silence
,
broken
only
by
a
sigh
from
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Cymon
,
"
said
the
lady
suddenly
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
Mr
Cymon
---
I
am
another
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
expressed
his
perfect
concurrence
in
a
statement
which
it
was
impossible
to
controvert
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
not
been
---
"
resumed
Belinda
;
and
there
she
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
---
what
?
"
said
Mr
Cymon
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
torture
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
not
been
"
---
continued
Mrs
Captain
Waters
---
"
if
,
in
earlier
life
,
it
had
been
my
fate
to
have
known
,
and
been
beloved
by
,
a
noble
youth
---
a
kindred
soul
---
a
congenial
spirit
---
one
capable
of
feeling
and
appreciating
the
sentiments
<EOS>
which

"
   
"
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
do
I
hear
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
!
<EOS>
can
I
believe
my
---
Come
up
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
This
last
unsentimental
parenthesis
was
addressed
to
the
donkey
,
who
,
with
his
head
between
his
fore
-
legs
,
appeared
to
be
examining
the
state
of
his
shoes
with
great
anxiety
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Hi
---
hi
---
<EOS>
hi
,
"
said
the
boys
behind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
up
,
"
expostulated
Cymon
Tuggs
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hi
---
hi
---
<EOS>
hi
,
"
repeated
the
boys
.
 
<EOS>
And
whether
it
was
that
the
animal
felt
indignant
at
the
tone
of
Mr
Tuggs
's
command
,
or
felt
alarmed
by
the
noise
of
the
deputy
proprietor
's
boots
running
behind
him
;
or
whether
he
burned
with
a
noble
emulation
to
outstrip
the
other
donkeys
;
certain
it
is
that
he
no
sooner
heard
the
second
series
of
"
hi
---
hi
's
,
"
than
he
started
away
,
with
a
celerity
of
pace
which
jerked
Mr
Cymon
's
hat
off
,
instantaneously
,
and
carried
him
to
the
Pegwell
Bay
hotel
in
no
time
,
where
he
deposited
his
rider
without
giving
him
the
trouble
of
dismounting
,
by
sagaciously
pitching
him
over
his
head
,
into
the
very
doorway
of
the
tavern
.
   
<EOS>
Great
was
the
confusion
of
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
,
when
he
was
put
right
end
uppermost
,
by
two
waiters
;
considerable
was
the
alarm
of
Mrs
Tuggs
in
behalf
of
her
son
;
agonizing
were
the
apprehensions
of
Mrs
Captain
Waters
on
his
account
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
speedily
discovered
,
however
,
that
he
had
not
sustained
much
more
injury
than
the
donkey
---
he
was
grazed
,
and
the
animal
was
grazing
---
and
then
it
WAS
a
delightful
party
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Tuggs
,
and
the
captain
,
had
ordered
lunch
in
the
little
garden
behind
:
 
---
small
saucers
of
large
shrimps
,
dabs
of
butter
,
crusty
loaves
,
and
bottled
ale
.
 
<EOS>
The
sky
was
without
a
cloud
;
there
were
flower
-
pots
and
turf
before
them
;
the
sea
,
from
the
foot
of
the
cliff
,
stretching
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
discern
anything
at
all
;
<EOS>
vessels
in
the
distance
with
sails
as
white
,
and
as
small
,
as
nicely
-
got
-
up
cambric
handkerchiefs
.
 
<EOS>
The
shrimps
were
delightful
,
the
ale
better
,
and
the
captain
even
more
pleasant
than
either
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Captain
Waters
was
in
SUCH
spirits
after
lunch
!
<EOS>
---
chasing
,
first
the
captain
across
the
turf
,
and
among
the
flower
-
pots
;
and
then
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
;
and
then
Miss
Tuggs
;
and
laughing
,
too
,
quite
boisterously
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
captain
said
,
it
did
n't
matter
;
who
knew
what
they
were
,
there
?
 
<EOS>
For
all
the
people
of
the
house
knew
,
they
might
be
common
people
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
responded
,
"
To
be
sure
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
they
went
down
the
steep
wooden
steps
a
little
further
on
,
which
led
to
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
;
and
looked
at
the
crabs
,
and
the
seaweed
,
and
the
eels
,
till
it
was
more
than
fully
time
to
go
back
to
Ramsgate
again
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
ascended
the
steps
last
,
and
Mrs
Captain
Waters
last
but
one
;
and
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
discovered
that
the
foot
and
ankle
of
Mrs
Captain
Waters
,
were
even
more
unexceptionable
than
he
had
at
first
supposed
.
   
<EOS>
Taking
a
donkey
towards
his
ordinary
place
of
residence
,
is
a
very
different
thing
,
and
a
feat
much
more
easily
to
be
accomplished
,
than
taking
him
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
requires
a
great
deal
of
foresight
and
presence
of
mind
in
the
one
case
,
to
anticipate
the
numerous
flights
of
his
discursive
imagination
;
whereas
,
in
the
other
,
all
you
have
to
do
,
is
,
to
hold
on
,
and
place
a
blind
confidence
in
the
animal
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
adopted
the
latter
expedient
on
his
return
;
and
his
nerves
were
so
little
discomposed
by
the
journey
,
that
he
distinctly
understood
they
were
all
to
meet
again
at
the
library
in
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
The
library
was
crowded
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
same
ladies
,
and
the
same
gentlemen
,
who
had
been
on
the
sands
in
the
morning
,
and
on
the
pier
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
young
ladies
,
in
maroon
-
coloured
gowns
and
black
velvet
bracelets
,
dispensing
fancy
articles
in
the
shop
,
and
presiding
over
games
of
chance
in
the
concert
-
room
.
<EOS>
There
were
marriageable
daughters
,
and
marriage
-
making
mammas
,
gaming
and
promenading
,
and
turning
over
music
,
and
flirting
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
male
beaux
doing
the
sentimental
in
whispers
,
and
others
doing
the
ferocious
in
moustache
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
Mrs
Tuggs
in
amber
,
Miss
Tuggs
in
sky
-
blue
,
Mrs
Captain
Waters
in
pink
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Captain
Waters
in
a
braided
surtout
;
there
was
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
in
pumps
and
a
gilt
waistcoat
;
there
was
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
in
a
blue
coat
and
a
shirt
-
frill
.
   
<EOS>
"
Numbers
three
,
eight
,
and
eleven

"
<EOS>
cried
one
of
the
young
ladies
in
the
maroon
-
coloured
gowns
.
   
<EOS>
"
Numbers
three
,
eight
,

"
echoed
another
young
lady
in
the
same
uniform
.
   
<EOS>
"
Number

said
the
first

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Numbers

echoed
the

<EOS>
"
Number

Mary

said
the
first
young

<EOS>
"
Number

"
screamed
the
second
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
numbers
are
all
taken
now
,
ladies
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
The
representatives
of
numbers
three
,
eight
,
and
eleven
,
and
the
rest
of
the
numbers
,
crowded
round
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
throw
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
said
the
presiding
goddess
,
handing
the
dice
-
box
to
the
eldest
daughter
of
a
stout
lady
,
with
four
girls
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
profound
silence
among
the
lookers
-
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
Throw
,
Jane
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
stout
lady
.
 
<EOS>
An
interesting
display
of
bashfulness
---
<EOS>
a
little
blushing
in
a
cambric
handkerchief
---
a
whispering
to
a
younger
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amelia
,
my
dear
,
throw
for
your
sister
,
"
said
the
stout
lady
;
and
then
she
turned
to
a
walking
advertisement
of
Rowlands
'
Macassar
Oil
,
who
stood
next
her
,
and
said
,
"
Jane
is
so
VERY
modest
and
retiring
;
but
I
ca
n't
be
angry
with
her
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
An
artless
and
unsophisticated
girl
is
SO
truly
amiable
,
that
I
often
wish
Amelia
was
more
like
her
sister
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
with
the
whiskers
whispered
his
admiring
approval
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
!
"
said
the
stout
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Amelia
threw
---
eight
for
her
sister
,
ten
for
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nice
figure
,
Amelia
,
"
whispered
the
stout
lady
to
a
thin
youth
beside
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beautiful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
SUCH
a
spirit
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
like
you
in
that
respect
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
NOT
help
admiring
that
life
and
vivacity
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
(
a
sigh
)
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
make
poor
Jane
a
little
more
like
my
dear
Amelia
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
cordially
acquiesced
in
the
sentiment
;
both
he
,
and
the
individual
first
addressed
,
were
perfectly
contented
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
of
Mrs
Captain
Waters
,
as
a
short
female
,
in
a
blue
velvet
hat
and
feathers
,
was
led
into
the
orchestra
,
by
a
fat
man
in
black
tights
and
cloudy
Berlins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Tippin
,
of
the
London
theatres
,
"
replied
Belinda
,
referring
to
the
programme
of
the
concert
.
   
<EOS>
The
talented
Tippin
having
condescendingly
acknowledged
the
clapping
of
hands
,
and
shouts
of
"
bravo
!
"
which
greeted
her
appearance
,
proceeded
to
sing
the
popular
cavatina
of
"
Bid
me
discourse
,
"
accompanied
on
the
piano
by
Mr
Tippin
;
after
which
,
Mr
Tippin
sang
a
comic
song
,
accompanied
on
the
piano
by
Mrs
Tippin
:
 
the
applause
consequent
upon
which
,
was
only
to
be
exceeded
by
the
enthusiastic
approbation
bestowed
upon
an
air
with
variations
on
the
guitar
,
by
Miss
Tippin
,
accompanied
on
the
chin
by
Master
Tippin
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
passed
the
evening
;
thus
passed
the
days
and
evenings
of
the
Tuggses
,
and
the
Waterses
,
for
six
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
Sands
in
the
morning
---
donkeys
at
noon
---
<EOS>
pier
in
the
afternoon
---
library
at
night
---
and
the
same
people
everywhere
.
   
<EOS>
On
that
very
night
six
weeks
,
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
over
the
calm
sea
,
which
dashed
against
the
feet
of
the
tall
gaunt
cliffs
,
with
just
enough
noise
to
lull
the
old
fish
to
sleep
,
without
disturbing
the
young
ones
,
when
two
figures
were
discernible
---
or
would
have
been
,
<EOS>
if
anybody
had
looked
for
them
---
seated
on
one
of
the
wooden
benches
which
are
stationed
near
the
verge
of
the
western
cliff
.
 
<EOS>
The
moon
had
climbed
higher
into
the
heavens
,
by
two
hours
'
journeying
,
since
those
figures
first
sat
down
---
and
yet
they
had
moved
not
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
of
loungers
had
thinned
and
dispersed
;
the
noise
of
itinerant
musicians
had
died
away
;
light
after
light
had
appeared
in
the
windows
of
the
different
houses
in
the
distance
;
blockade
-
man
after
blockade
-
man
had
passed
the
spot
,
wending
his
way
towards
his
solitary
post
;
and
yet
those
figures
had
remained
stationary
.
 
<EOS>
Some
portions
of
the
two
forms
were
in
deep
shadow
,
but
the
light
of
the
moon
fell
strongly
on
a
puce
-
coloured
boot
and
a
glazed
stock
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
and
Mrs
Captain
Waters
were
seated
on
that
bench
.
 
<EOS>
They
spoke
not
,
but
were
silently
gazing
on
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Walter
will
return
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Mrs
Captain
Waters
,
mournfully
breaking
silence
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
sighed
like
a
gust
of
wind
through
a
forest
of
gooseberry
bushes
,
as
he
replied
,
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
he
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Cymon
!
"
resumed
Belinda
,
"
the
chaste
delight
,
the
calm
happiness
,
of
this
one
week
of
Platonic
love
,
is
too
much
for
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Cymon
was
about
to
suggest
that
it
was
too
little
for
him
,
but
he
stopped
himself
,
and
murmured
unintelligibly
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
to
think
that
even
this
gleam
of
happiness
,
innocent
as
it
is
,
"
exclaimed
Belinda
,
"
is
now
to
be
lost
for
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
not
say
for
ever
,
Belinda
,
"
exclaimed
the
excitable
Cymon
,
as
two
strongly
-
defined
tears
chased
each
other
down
his
pale
face
<EOS>
---
it
was
so
long
that
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
a
chase
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
say
for
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
"
replied
Belinda
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
urged
Cymon
,
"
<EOS>
oh
why
?
 
<EOS>
Such
Platonic
acquaintance
as
ours
is
so
harmless
,
that
even
your
husband
can
never
object
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
husband
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Belinda
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
little
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jealous
and
revengeful
;
ferocious
in
his
revenge
---
a
maniac
in
his
jealousy
!
 
<EOS>
Would
you
be
assassinated
before
my
eyes
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
,
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
,
expressed
his
disinclination
to
undergo
the
process
of
assassination
before
the
eyes
of
anybody
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
leave
me
,
"
said
Mrs
Captain
Waters
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
,
this
night
,
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
late
:
 
let
us
return
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
sadly
offered
the
lady
his
arm
,
and
escorted
her
to
her
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
at
the
door
<EOS>
---
he
felt
a
Platonic
pressure
of
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
"
he
said
,
hesitating
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
night
,
"
sobbed
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
paused
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
walk
in
,
sir
?
"
said
the
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tuggs
hesitated
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
hesitation
!
 
<EOS>
He
DID
walk
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
"
said
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
again
,
when
he
reached
the
drawing
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Belinda
;
"
and
,
if
at
any
period
of
my
life
,
I
---
Hush
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
lady
paused
and
stared
with
a
steady
gaze
of
horror
,
on
the
ashy
countenance
of
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
double
knock
at
the
street
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
husband
!
"
<EOS>
said
Belinda
,
as
the
captain
's
voice
was
heard
below
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
my
family
!
<EOS>
"
added
Cymon
Tuggs
,
as
the
voices
of
his
relatives
floated
up
the
staircase
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
curtain
!
 
<EOS>
The
curtain
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
Mrs
Captain
Waters
,
pointing
to
the
window
,
before
which
some
chintz
hangings
were
closely
drawn
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
done
nothing
wrong
,
"
said
the
hesitating
Cymon
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
curtain
!
"
reiterated
the
frantic
lady
:
 
"
you
will
be
murdered
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
last
appeal
to
his
feelings
was
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
The
dismayed
Cymon
concealed
himself
behind
the
curtain
with
pantomimic
suddenness
.
   
<EOS>
Enter
the
captain
,
Joseph
Tuggs
,
Mrs
Tuggs
,
and
Charlotta
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
the
captain
,
"
Lieutenant
,
Slaughter
.
"
 
<EOS>
Two
iron
-
shod
boots
and
one
gruff
voice
were
heard
by
Mr
Cymon
to
advance
,
and
acknowledge
the
honour
of
the
introduction
.
 
<EOS>
The
sabre
of
the
lieutenant
rattled
heavily
upon
the
floor
,
as
he
seated
himself
at
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cymon
's
fears
almost
overcame
his
reason
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
brandy
,
my
dear
!
"
said
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
a
situation
!
<EOS>
They
were
going
to
make
a
night
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
was
pent
up
behind
the
curtain
and
afraid
to
breathe
!
   
<EOS>
"
Slaughter
,
"
said
the
captain
,
"
a
cigar
?
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
never
could
smoke
without
feeling
it
indispensably
necessary
to
retire
,
immediately
,
and
never
could
smell
smoke
without
a
strong
disposition
to
cough
.
 
<EOS>
The
cigars
were
introduced
;
the
captain
was
a
professed
smoker
;
so
was
the
lieutenant
;
so
was
Joseph
Tuggs
.
 
<EOS>
The
apartment
was
small
,
the
door
was
closed
,
the
smoke
powerful
:
 
<EOS>
it
hung
in
heavy
wreaths
over
the
room
,
and
at
length
found
its
way
behind
the
curtain
.
 
<EOS>
Cymon
Tuggs
held
his
nose
,
his
mouth
,
his
breath

<EOS>
It
was
all
of
no
use
---
out
came
the
cough
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
captain
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Tuggs
.
<EOS>
You
dislike
smoking
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
;
I
do
n't
indeed
,
"
said
Charlotta
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
makes
you
cough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
coughed
just
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
,
Captain
Waters
!
 
<EOS>
Lor
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
say
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Somebody
coughed
,
"
said
the
captain
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
thought
so
,
"
said
Slaughter
.
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
everybody
denied
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fancy
,
"
said
the
captain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Must
be
,
"
echoed
Slaughter
.
   
<EOS>
Cigars
resumed
---
more
smoke
---
another
cough
---
smothered
,
but
violent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Damned
odd
!
"
said
the
captain
,
staring
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sing'ler
!
"
ejaculated
the
unconscious
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
.
   
<EOS>
Lieutenant
Slaughter
looked
first
at
one
person
mysteriously
,
then
at
another
:
 
then
,
laid
down
his
cigar
,
then
approached
the
window
on
tiptoe
,
and
pointed
with
his
right
thumb
over
his
shoulder
,
in
the
direction
of
the
curtain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Slaughter
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
captain
,
rising
from
table
,
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
in
reply
,
drew
back
the
curtain
and
discovered
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
behind
it
:
 
pallid
with
apprehension
,
and
blue
with
wanting
to
cough
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
captain
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
see
?
<EOS>
Slaughter
,
your
sabre
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cymon
!
"
screamed
the
Tuggses
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mercy
!
"
said
Belinda
.
   
<EOS>
"
Platonic
!
"
gasped
Cymon
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
sabre
!
"
roared
the
captain
:
 
"
Slaughter
---
<EOS>
unhand
me
---
the
villain
's
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Murder
!
"
screamed
the
Tuggses
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
him
fast
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
faintly
articulated
Cymon
.
   
<EOS>
"
Water
!
"
exclaimed
Joseph
Tuggs
---
and
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
and
all
the
ladies
<EOS>
forthwith
fainted
away
,
and
formed
a
tableau
.
   
<EOS>
Most
willingly
would
we
conceal
the
disastrous
termination
of
the
six
weeks
'
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
A
troublesome
form
,
and
an
arbitrary
custom
,
however
,
prescribe
that
a
story
should
have
a
conclusion
,
in
addition
to
a
commencement
;
we
have
therefore
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
Lieutenant
Slaughter
brought
a
message
---
the
captain
brought
an
action
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Joseph
Tuggs
interposed
---
the
lieutenant
negotiated
.
<EOS>
When
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
recovered
from
the
nervous
disorder
into
which
misplaced
affection
,
and
exciting
circumstances
,
had
plunged
him
,
he
found
that
his
family
had
lost
their
pleasant
acquaintance
;
that
his
father
was
minus
fifteen
hundred
pounds
;
and
the
captain
plus
the
precise
sum
.
 
<EOS>
The
money
was
paid
to
hush
the
matter
up
,
but
it
got
abroad
notwithstanding
;
and
there
are
not
wanting
some
who
affirm
that
three
designing
impostors
never
found
more
easy
dupes
,
than
did
Captain
Waters
,
Mrs
Waters
,
and
Lieutenant
Slaughter
,
in
the
Tuggses
at
Ramsgate
.
   
<EOS>
Horatio
Sparkins
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
my
love
,
he
paid
Teresa
very
great
attention
on
the
last
assembly
night
,
"
said
Mrs
Malderton
,
addressing
her
spouse
,
who
,
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
in
the
City
,
was
sitting
with
a
silk
handkerchief
over
his
head
,
and
his
feet
on
the
fender
,
drinking
his
port
;
---
"
very
great
attention
;
and
I
say
again
,
every
possible
encouragement
ought
to
be
given
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
positively
must
be
asked
down
here
to
dine
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
must
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Malderton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
know
whom
I
mean
,
my
dear
---
the
young
man
with
the
black
whiskers
and
the
white
cravat
,
who
has
just
come
out
at
our
assembly
,
and
whom
all
the
girls
are
talking
about
.
 
<EOS>
Young
---
dear
me
!
<EOS>
what
's
his
name
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Marianne
,
what
IS
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
continued
Mrs
Malderton
,
addressing
her
youngest
daughter
,
who
was
engaged
in
netting
a
purse
,
and
looking
sentimental
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Horatio
Sparkins
,
ma
,
"
replied
Miss
Marianne
,
with
a
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
to
be
sure
---
Horatio
Sparkins
,
"
said
Mrs
Malderton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Decidedly
the
most
gentleman
-
like
young
man
I
ever
saw
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
in
the
beautifully
-
made
coat
he
wore
the
other
night
,
he
looked
like
---
like
---
"
   
"
Like
Prince
Leopold
,
ma
---
so
noble
,
so
full
of
sentiment
!
<EOS>
"
suggested
Marianne
,
in
a
tone
of
enthusiastic
admiration
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
recollect
,
my
dear
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Malderton
,
"
that
Teresa
is
now
eight
-
and
-
twenty
;
and
that
it
really
is
very
important
that
something
should
be
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Teresa
Malderton
was
a
very
little
girl
,
rather
fat
,
with
vermilion
cheeks
,
but
good
-
humoured
,
and
still
disengaged
,
<EOS>
although
,
to
do
her
justice
,
the
misfortune
arose
from
no
lack
of
perseverance
on
her
part
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
had
she
flirted
for
ten
years
;
in
vain
had
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Malderton
assiduously
kept
up
an
extensive
acquaintance
among
the
young
eligible
bachelors
of
Camberwell
,
and
even
of
Wandsworth
and
Brixton
;
to
say
nothing
of
those
who
"
dropped
in
"
from
town
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Malderton
was
as
well
known
as
the
lion
on
the
top
of
Northumberland
House
,
and
had
an
equal
chance
of
"
going
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
sure
you
'd
like
him
,
"
continued
Mrs
Malderton
,
"
he
is
so
gentlemanly
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
clever
!
"
said
Miss
Marianne
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
has
such
a
flow
of
language
!
"
<EOS>
added
Miss
Teresa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
a
great
respect
for
you
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Malderton
to
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Malderton
coughed
,
and
looked
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
I
'm
sure
he
's
very
much
attached
to
pa
's
society
,
"
said
Miss
Marianne
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
"
echoed
Miss
Teresa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
he
said
as
much
to
me
in
confidence
,
"
observed
Mrs
Malderton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
returned
Mr
Malderton
,
somewhat
flattered
;
"
if
I
see
him
at
the
assembly
to
-
morrow
,
perhaps
I
'll
ask
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
knows
we
live
at
Oak
Lodge
,
Camberwell
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
---
and
that
you
keep
a
one
-
horse
carriage
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
about
it
,
"
said
Mr
Malderton
,
composing
himself
for
a
nap
;
"
I
'll
see
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Malderton
was
a
man
whose
whole
scope
of
ideas
was
limited
to
Lloyd
's
,
the
Exchange
,
the
India
House
,
and
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
successful
speculations
had
raised
him
from
a
situation
of
obscurity
and
comparative
poverty
,
to
a
state
of
affluence
.
 
<EOS>
As
frequently
happens
in
such
cases
,
the
ideas
of
himself
and
his
family
became
elevated
to
an
extraordinary
pitch
as
their
means
increased
;
they
affected
fashion
,
taste
,
and
many
other
fooleries
,
in
imitation
of
their
betters
,
and
had
a
very
decided
and
becoming
horror
of
anything
which
could
,
by
possibility
,
be
considered
low
.
<EOS>
He
was
hospitable
from
ostentation
,
illiberal
from
ignorance
,
and
prejudiced
from
conceit
.
 
<EOS>
Egotism
and
the
love
of
display
induced
him
to
keep
an
excellent
table
:
 
convenience
,
and
a
love
of
good
things
of
this
life
,
ensured
him
plenty
of
guests
.
 
<EOS>
He
liked
to
have
clever
men
,
or
what
he
considered
such
,
at
his
table
,
because
it
was
a
great
thing
to
talk
about
;
but
he
never
could
endure
what
he
called
"
sharp
fellows
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Probably
,
he
cherished
this
feeling
out
of
compliment
to
his
two
sons
,
who
gave
their
respected
parent
no
uneasiness
in
that
particular
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
were
ambitious
of
forming
acquaintances
and
connexions
in
some
sphere
of
society
superior
to
that
in
which
they
themselves
moved
;
and
one
of
the
necessary
consequences
of
this
desire
,
added
to
their
utter
ignorance
of
the
world
beyond
their
own
small
circle
,
was
,
that
any
one
who
could
lay
claim
to
an
acquaintance
with
people
of
rank
and
title
,
had
a
sure
passport
to
the
table
at
Oak
Lodge
,
Camberwell
.
   
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
Mr
Horatio
Sparkins
at
the
assembly
,
had
excited
no
small
degree
of
surprise
and
curiosity
among
its
regular
frequenters
.
 
<EOS>
Who
could
he
be
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
reserved
,
and
apparently
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
Was
he
a
clergyman
?
---
<EOS>
He
danced
too
well
.
<EOS>
A
barrister
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
not
called
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
very
fine
words
,
and
talked
a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
Could
he
be
a
distinguished
foreigner
,
come
to
England
for
the
purpose
of
describing
the
country
,
its
manners
and
customs
;
and
frequenting
public
balls
and
public
dinners
,
with
the
view
of
becoming
acquainted
with
high
life
,
polished
etiquette
,
and
English
refinement
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
No
,
he
had
not
a
foreign
accent
.
 
<EOS>
Was
he
a
surgeon
,
a
contributor
to
the
magazines
,
a
writer
of
fashionable
novels
,
or
an
artist
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
No
;
to
each
and
all
of
these
surmises
,
there
existed
some
valid
objection
.
<EOS>
---
"
Then
,
"
said
everybody
,
"
he
must
be
SOMEBODY
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
I
should
think
he
must
be
,
"
reasoned
Mr
Malderton
,
within
himself
,
"
because
he
perceives
our
superiority
,
and
pays
us
so
much
attention
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
night
succeeding
the
conversation
we
have
just
recorded
,
was
"
assembly
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
double
-
fly
was
ordered
to
be
at
the
door
of
Oak
Lodge
at
nine
o'clock
precisely
.
 
<EOS>
The
Miss
Maldertons
were
dressed
in
sky
-
blue
satin
trimmed
with
artificial
flowers
;
and
Mrs
M
(
who
was
a
little
fat
woman
)
,
in
ditto
ditto
,
looked
like
her
eldest
daughter
multiplied
by
two
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Frederick
Malderton
,
the
eldest
son
,
in
full
-
dress
costume
,
was
the
very
BEAU
IDEAL
of
a
smart
waiter
;
and
Mr
Thomas
Malderton
,
the
youngest
,
with
his
white
dress
-
stock
,
blue
coat
,
bright
buttons
,
and
red
watch
-
ribbon
,
strongly
resembled
the
portrait
of
that
interesting
,
but
rash
young
gentleman
,
George
Barnwell
.
 
<EOS>
Every
member
of
the
party
had
made
up
his
or
her
mind
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
Mr
Horatio
Sparkins
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Teresa
,
of
course
,
was
to
be
as
amiable
and
interesting
as
ladies
of
eight
-
and
-
twenty
on
the
look
-
out
for
a
husband
,
usually
are
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Malderton
would
be
all
smiles
and
graces
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Marianne
would
request
the
favour
of
some
verses
for
her
album
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Malderton
would
patronise
the
great
unknown
by
asking
him
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
intended
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
his
information
on
the
interesting
topics
of
snuff
and
cigars
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Mr
Frederick
Malderton
himself
,
the
family
authority
on
all
points
of
taste
,
dress
,
and
fashionable
arrangement
;
who
had
lodgings
of
his
own
in
town
;
who
had
a
free
admission
to
Covent
-
garden
theatre
;
who
always
dressed
according
to
the
fashions
of
the
months
;
who
went
up
the
water
twice
a
-
week
in
the
season
;
and
who
actually
had
an
intimate
friend
who
once
knew
a
gentleman
who
formerly
lived
in
the
Albany
,
---
even
he
had
determined
that
Mr
Horatio
Sparkins
must
be
a
devilish
good
fellow
,
and
that
he
would
do
him
the
honour
of
challenging
him
to
a
game
at
billiards
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
object
that
met
the
anxious
eyes
of
the
expectant
family
on
their
entrance
into
the
ball
-
room
,
was
the
interesting
Horatio
,
with
his
hair
brushed
off
his
forehead
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
,
reclining
in
a
contemplative
attitude
on
one
of
the
seats
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
he
is
,
my
dear
,
"
whispered
Mrs
Malderton
to
Mr
Malderton
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
like
Lord
Byron
!
"
murmured
Miss
Teresa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
Montgomery
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Miss
Marianne
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Or
the
portraits
of
Captain
Cook
!
"
suggested
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
---
do
n't
be
an
ass
!
"
<EOS>
said
his
father
,
who
checked
him
on
all
occasions
,
probably
with
a
view
to
prevent
his
becoming
"
sharp
"
---
which
was
very
unnecessary
.
   
<EOS>
The
elegant
Sparkins
attitudinised
with
admirable
effect
,
until
the
family
had
crossed
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
started
up
,
with
the
most
natural
appearance
of
surprise
and
delight
;
accosted
Mrs
Malderton
with
the
utmost
cordiality
;
saluted
the
young
ladies
in
the
most
enchanting
manner
;
bowed
to
,
and
shook
hands
with
Mr
Malderton
,
with
a
degree
of
respect
amounting
almost
to
veneration
;
and
returned
the
greetings
of
the
two
young
men
in
a
half
-
gratified
,
half
-
patronising
manner
,
which
fully
convinced
them
that
he
must
be
an
important
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
condescending
personage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Malderton
,
"
said
Horatio
,
after
the
ordinary
salutations
,
and
bowing
very
low
,
"
may
I
be
permitted

you

me
to
have
the
pleasure

"
   
"
I
do
n't
THINK
I
am
engaged
,
"
said
Miss
Teresa
,
with
a
dreadful
affectation
of
indifference
---
<EOS>
"
but
,
really
---
so
many
---
"
   
Horatio
looked
handsomely
miserable
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
most
happy
,
"
simpered
the
interesting
Teresa
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
Horatio
's
countenance
brightened
up
,
like
an
old
hat
in
a
shower
of
rain
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
genteel
young
man
,
certainly
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
gratified
Mr
Malderton
,
as
the
obsequious
Sparkins
and
his
partner
joined
the
quadrille
which
was
just
forming
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
a
remarkably
good
address
,
"
said
Mr
Frederick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
is
a
prime
fellow
,
"
interposed
Tom
,
who
always
managed
to
put
his
foot
in
it
---
"
he
talks
just
like
an
auctioneer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
!
"
said
his
father
solemnly
,
"
I
think
I
desired
you
,
before
,
not
to
be
a
fool
.
"
 
<EOS>
Tom
looked
as
happy
as
a
cock
on
a
drizzly
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
delightful
!
"
said
the
interesting
Horatio
to
his
partner
,
as
they
promenaded
the
room
at
the
conclusion
of
the
set
---
"
how
delightful
,
how
refreshing
it
is
,
to
retire
from
the
cloudy
storms
,
the
vicissitudes
,
and
the
troubles
,
of
life
,
even
if
it
be
but
for
a
few
short
fleeting
moments
:
 
and
to
spend
those
moments
,
fading
and
evanescent
though
they
be
,
in
the
delightful
,
the
blessed
society
of
one
individual
---
whose
frowns
would
be
death
,
whose
coldness
would
be
madness
,
whose
falsehood
would
be
ruin
,
whose
constancy
would
be
bliss
;
the
possession
of
whose
affection
would
be
the
brightest
and
best
reward
that
Heaven
could
bestow
on
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
feeling
!
<EOS>
what
sentiment
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Miss
Teresa
,
as
she
leaned
more
heavily
on
her
companion
's
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
enough
---
enough
!
"
resumed
the
elegant
Sparkins
,
with
a
theatrical
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
said
?
<EOS>
what
have
I
---
<EOS>
I
---
to
do
with
sentiments
like
these
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Malderton
"
---
here
he
stopped
short
---
"
may
I
hope
to
be
permitted
to
offer
the
humble
tribute
of
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Really
,
Mr
Sparkins
,
"
returned
the
enraptured
Teresa
,
blushing
in
the
sweetest
confusion
,
"
I
must
refer
you
to
papa
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
can
,
without
his
consent
,
venture
to

<EOS>
"
   
"
Surely
he
can
not
object
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
,
you
know
him
not
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Miss
Teresa
,
<EOS>
well
knowing
there
was
nothing
to
fear
,
but
wishing
to
make
the
interview
resemble
a
scene
in
some
romantic
novel
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
object
to
my
offering
you
a
glass
of
negus
,
"
returned
the
adorable
Sparkins
,
with
some
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
thought
the
disappointed
Teresa
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
fuss
about
nothing
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
give
me
the
greatest
pleasure
,
sir
,
to
see
you
to
dinner
at
Oak
Lodge
,
Camberwell
,
on
Sunday
next
at
five
o'clock
,
if
you
have
no
better
engagement
,
"
said
Mr
Malderton
,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evening
,
as
he
and
his
sons
were
standing
in
conversation
with
Mr
Horatio
Sparkins
.
   
<EOS>
Horatio
bowed
his
acknowledgments
,
and
accepted
the
flattering
invitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
,
"
continued
the
father
,
offering
his
snuff
-
box
to
his
new
acquaintance
,
"
that
I
do
n't
enjoy
these
assemblies
half
so
much
as
the
comfort
<EOS>
---
I
had
almost
said
the
luxury
---
of
Oak
Lodge
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
great
charms
for
an
elderly
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
after
all
,
sir
,
what
is
man
?
"
said
the
metaphysical
Sparkins
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
what
is
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
very
true
,
"
said
Mr
Malderton
;
"
very
true
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
know
that
we
live
and
breathe
,
"
continued
Horatio
;
"
that
we
have
wants
and
wishes
,
desires
and
appetites
---
"
   
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Frederick
Malderton
,
looking
profound
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
we
know
that
we
exist
,
"
repeated
Horatio
,
raising
his
voice
,
"
but
there
we
stop
;
there
,
is
an
end
to
our
knowledge
;
there
,
is
the
summit
of
our
attainments
;
there
,
is
the
termination
of
our
ends
.
 
<EOS>
What
more
do
we
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Mr
Frederick
---
than
whom
no
one
was
more
capable
of
answering
for
himself
in
that
particular
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
was
about
to
hazard
something
,
but
,
fortunately
for
his
reputation
,
he
caught
his
father
's
angry
eye
,
and
slunk
off
like
a
puppy
convicted
of
petty
larceny
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
said
Mr
Malderton
the
elder
,
as
they
were
returning
home
in
the
fly
,
"
that
Mr
Sparkins
is
a
wonderful
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
Such
surprising
knowledge
!
<EOS>
such
extraordinary
information
!
<EOS>
and
such
a
splendid
mode
of
expressing
himself
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
must
be
somebody
in
disguise
,
"
said
Miss
Marianne
.
<EOS>
"
How
charmingly
romantic
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
talks
very
loud
and
nicely
,
"
timidly
observed
Tom
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
exactly
understand
what
he
means
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
almost
begin
to
despair
of
your
understanding
anything
,
Tom
,
"
said
his
father
,
who
,
of
course
,
had
been
much
enlightened
by
Mr
Horatio
Sparkins
's
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
strikes
me
,
Tom
,
"
said
Miss
Teresa
,
"
that
you
have
made
yourself
very
ridiculous
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
"
cried
everybody
---
and
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
Tom
reduced
himself
into
the
least
possible
space
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Malderton
had
a
long
conversation
respecting
their
daughter
's
prospects
and
future
arrangements
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Teresa
went
to
bed
,
considering
whether
,
in
the
event
of
her
marrying
a
title
,
she
could
conscientiously
encourage
the
visits
of
her
present
associates
;
and
dreamed
,
all
night
,
of
disguised
noblemen
,
large
routs
,
ostrich
plumes
,
bridal
favours
,
and
Horatio
Sparkins
.
   
<EOS>
Various
surmises
were
hazarded
on
the
Sunday
morning
,
as
to
the
mode
of
conveyance
which
the
anxiously
-
expected
Horatio
would
adopt
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
keep
a
gig
?
---
was
it
possible
he
could
come
on
horseback
?
<EOS>
---
or
would
he
patronize
the
stage
?
 
<EOS>
These
,
and
other
various
conjectures
of
equal
importance
,
engrossed
the
attention
of
Mrs
Malderton
and
her
daughters
during
the
whole
morning
after
church
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
my
dear
,
it
's
a
most
annoying
thing
that
that
vulgar
brother
of
yours
should
have
invited
himself
to
dine
here
to
-
day
,
"
said
Mr
Malderton
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
account
of
Mr
Sparkins
's
coming
down
,
I
purposely
abstained
from
asking
any
one
but
Flamwell
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
to
think
of
your
brother
---
a
tradesman
<EOS>
---
it
's
insufferable
!
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
would
n't
have
him
mention
his
shop
,
before
our
new
guest
---
no
,
not
for
a
thousand
pounds
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
care
if
he
had
the
good
sense
to
conceal
the
disgrace
he
is
to
the
family
;
but
he
's
so
fond
of
his
horrible
business
,
that
he
WILL
let
people
know
what
he
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jacob
Barton
,
the
individual
alluded
to
,
was
a
large
grocer
;
so
vulgar
,
and
so
lost
to
all
sense
of
feeling
,
that
he
actually
never
scrupled
to
avow
that
he
was
n't
above
his
business
:
 
<EOS>
"
he
'd
made
his
money
by
it
,
and
he
did
n't
care
who
know'd
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Flamwell
,
my
dear
fellow
,
how
d'ye
do
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Malderton
,
as
a
little
spoffish
man
,
with
green
spectacles
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
You
got
my
note
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
did
;
and
here
I
am
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
happen
to
know
this
Mr
Sparkins
by
name
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
everybody
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Flamwell
was
one
of
those
gentlemen
of
remarkably
extensive
information
whom
one
occasionally
meets
in
society
,
who
pretend
to
know
everybody
,
but
in
reality
know
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
At
Malderton
's
,
where
any
stories
about
great
people
were
received
with
a
greedy
ear
,
he
was
an
especial
favourite
;
and
,
knowing
the
kind
of
people
he
had
to
deal
with
,
he
carried
his
passion
of
claiming
acquaintance
with
everybody
,
to
the
most
immoderate
length
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
rather
a
singular
way
of
telling
his
greatest
lies
in
a
parenthesis
,
and
with
an
air
of
self
-
denial
,
as
if
he
feared
being
thought
egotistical
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
,
I
do
n't
know
him
by
that
name
,
"
returned
Flamwell
,
in
a
low
tone
,
and
with
an
air
of
immense
importance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
I
know
him
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
tall
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Middle
-
sized
,
"
said
Miss
Teresa
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
black
hair
?
"
inquired
Flamwell
,
hazarding
a
bold
guess
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Miss
Teresa
,
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
a
snub
nose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
disappointed
Teresa
,
"
he
has
a
Roman
nose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
a
Roman
nose
,
did
n't
I
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Flamwell
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
an
elegant
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
remarkably
prepossessing
manners
?
"
   
"
Oh
,
yes
!
"
said
all
the
family
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
thought
you
knew
him
,
if
he
was
anybody
,
"
triumphantly
exclaimed
Mr
Malderton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
d'ye
think
he
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
from
your
description
,
"
said
Flamwell
,
ruminating
,
and
sinking
his
voice
,
almost
to
a
whisper
,
"
he
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
Honourable
Augustus
Fitz
-
Edward
Fitz
-
John
Fitz
-
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
very
talented
young
man
,
and
rather
eccentric
.
<EOS>
It
's
extremely
probable
he
may
have
changed
his
name
for
some
temporary
purpose
.
"
   
<EOS>
Teresa
's
heart
beat
high
.
 
<EOS>
Could
he
be
the
Honourable
Augustus
Fitz
-
Edward
Fitz
-
John
Fitz
-
Osborne
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
name
to
be
elegantly
engraved
upon
two
glazed
cards
,
tied
together
with
a
piece
of
white
satin
ribbon
!
 
<EOS>
"
The
Honourable
Mrs
Augustus
Fitz
-
Edward
Fitz
-
John
Fitz
-
Osborne
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
thought
was
transport
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
five
minutes
to
five
,
"
said
Mr
Malderton
,
looking
at
his
watch
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
's
not
going
to
disappoint
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
he
is
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Teresa
,
as
a
loud
double
-
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
endeavoured
to
look
---
as
people
when
they
particularly
expect
a
visitor
always
do
---
as
if
they
were
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
the
approach
of
anybody
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
-
door
opened
---
"
Mr
Barton
!
"
said
the
servant
.
   
<EOS>
"
Confound
the
man
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Malderton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
how
d'ye
do
!
 
<EOS>
Any
news
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
no
,
"
returned
the
grocer
,
in
his
usual
bluff
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
none
partickler
.
 
<EOS>
None
that
I
am
much
aware
of
.
 
<EOS>
How
d'ye
do
,
gals
and
boys
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flamwell
,
sir
---
glad
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Mr
Sparkins
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
who
had
been
looking
out
at
the
window
,
"
on
SUCH
a
black
horse
!
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
Horatio
,
sure
enough
,
on
a
large
black
horse
,
curvetting
and
prancing
along
,
like
an
Astley
's
supernumerary
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
great
deal
of
reining
in
,
and
pulling
up
,
with
the
accompaniments
of
snorting
,
rearing
,
and
kicking
,
the
animal
consented
to
stop
at
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
gate
,
where
Mr
Sparkins
dismounted
,
and
confided
him
to
the
care
of
Mr
Malderton
's
groom
.
 
<EOS>
The
ceremony
of
introduction
was
gone
through
,
in
all
due
form
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Flamwell
looked
from
behind
his
green
spectacles
at
Horatio
with
an
air
of
mysterious
importance
;
and
the
gallant
Horatio
looked
unutterable
things
at
Teresa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
the
Honourable
Mr
Augustus
What's
-
his
-
name
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mrs
Malderton
to
Flamwell
,
as
he
was
escorting
her
to
the
dining
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
---
at
least
not
exactly
,
"
returned
that
great
authority
---
"
not
exactly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
IS
he
then
?
"
   
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
said
Flamwell
,
nodding
his
head
with
a
grave
air
,
importing
that
he
knew
very
well
;
but
was
prevented
,
by
some
grave
reasons
of
state
,
from
disclosing
the
important
secret
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
be
one
of
the
ministers
making
himself
acquainted
with
the
views
of
the
people
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Sparkins
,
"
said
the
delighted
Mrs
Malderton
,
"
pray
divide
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
put
a
chair
for
the
gentleman
between
Miss
Teresa
and
Miss
Marianne
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
a
man
who
,
on
ordinary
occasions
,
acted
as
half
-
groom
,
half
-
gardener
;
but
who
,
as
it
was
important
to
make
an
impression
on
Mr
Sparkins
,
had
been
forced
into
a
white
neckerchief
and
shoes
,
and
touched
up
,
and
brushed
,
to
look
like
a
second
footman
.
   
<EOS>
The
dinner
was
excellent
;
Horatio
was
most
attentive
to
Miss
Teresa
,
and
every
one
felt
in
high
spirits
,
except
Mr
Malderton
,
who
,
knowing
the
propensity
of
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Mr
Barton
,
endured
that
sort
of
agony
which
the
newspapers
inform
us
is
experienced
by
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
when
a
pot
-
boy
hangs
himself
in
a
hay
-
loft
,
and
which
is
"
much
easier
to
be
imagined
than
described
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
your
friend
,
Sir
Thomas
Noland
,
lately
,
Flamwell
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Malderton
,
casting
a
sidelong
look
at
Horatio
,
to
see
what
effect
the
mention
of
so
great
a
man
had
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
---
not
very
lately
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Lord
Gubbleton
the
day
before
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
his
lordship
is
very
well
?
"
said
Malderton
,
in
a
tone
of
the
greatest
interest
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
,
until
that
moment
,
he
had
been
quite
innocent
of
the
existence
of
such
a
person
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
;
he
was
very
well
---
very
well
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
devilish
good
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
him
in
the
City
,
and
had
a
long
chat
with
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
'm
rather
intimate
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
stop
to
talk
to
him
as
long
as
I
could
wish
,
though
,
because
I
was
on
my
way
to
a
banker
's
,
a
very
rich
man
,
and
a
member
of
Parliament
,
with
whom
I
am
also
rather
,
indeed
I
may
say
very
,
intimate
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
whom
you
mean
,
"
returned
the
host
,
consequentially
---
in
reality
knowing
as
much
about
the
matter
as
Flamwell
himself
.
<EOS>
---
"
He
has
a
capital
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
touching
on
a
dangerous
topic
.
   
<EOS>
"
Talking
of
business
,
"
interposed
Mr
Barton
,
from
the
centre
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
whom
you
knew
very
well
,
Malderton
,
before
you
made
that
first
lucky
spec
of
yours
,
called
at
our
shop
the
other
day
,
and
---
"
   
"
Barton
,
may
I
trouble
you
for
a
potato
?
"
<EOS>
interrupted
the
wretched
master
of
the
house
,
hoping
to
nip
the
story
in
the
bud
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
returned
the
grocer
,
quite
insensible
of
his
brother
-
in
-
law
's
object
---
"
and
he
said
in
a
very
plain
manner
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
FLOURY
,
if
you
please
,
"
interrupted
Malderton
again
;
dreading
the
termination
of
the
anecdote
,
and
fearing
a
repetition
of
the
word
"
shop
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
said
,
says
he
,
"
continued
the
culprit
,
after
despatching
the
potato
;
"
says
he
,
how
goes
on
your
business
?
 
<EOS>
So
I
said
,
jokingly
<EOS>
---
you
know
my
way
---
says
I
,
I
'm
never
above
my
business
,
and
I
hope
my
business
will
never
be
above
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
   
"
Mr
Sparkins
,
"
said
the
host
,
vainly
endeavouring
to
conceal
his
dismay
,
"
a
glass
of
wine
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
utmost
pleasure
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Happy
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
were
talking
the
other
evening
,
"
resumed
the
host
,
addressing
Horatio
,
partly
with
the
view
of
displaying
the
conversational
powers
of
his
new
acquaintance
,
and
partly
in
the
hope
of
drowning
the
grocer
's
stories
---
"
we
were
talking
the
other
night
about
the
nature
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
Your
argument
struck
me
very
forcibly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
me
,
"
said
Mr
Frederick
.
 
<EOS>
Horatio
made
a
graceful
inclination
of
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
what
is
your
opinion
of
woman
,
Mr
Sparkins
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mrs
Malderton
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
simpered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Man
,
"
replied
Horatio
,
"
man
,
whether
he
ranged
the
bright
,
gay
,
flowery
plains
of
a
second
Eden
,
or
the
more
sterile
,
barren
,
and
<EOS>
I
may
say
,
commonplace
regions
,
to
which
we
are
compelled
to
accustom
ourselves
,
in
times
such
as
these
;
man
,
under
any
circumstances
,
or
in
any
place
---
whether
he
were
bending
beneath
the
withering
blasts
of
the
frigid
zone
,
or
scorching
under
the
rays
of
a
vertical
sun
---
man
,
without
woman
,
would
be
---
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
to
find
you
entertain
such
honourable
opinions
,
Mr
Sparkins
,
"
said
Mrs
Malderton
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
,
"
added
Miss
Teresa
.
 
<EOS>
Horatio
looked
his
delight
,
and
the
young
lady
blushed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
it
's
my
opinion
---
"
said
Mr
Barton
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
you
're
going
to
say
,
"
interposed
Malderton
,
determined
not
to
give
his
relation
another
opportunity
,
"
and
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
inquired
the
astonished
grocer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
differ
from
you
,
Barton
,
"
said
the
host
,
in
as
positive
a
manner
as
if
he
really
were
contradicting
a
position
which
the
other
had
laid
down
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
give
my
assent
to
what
I
consider
a
very
monstrous
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
meant
to
say
---
"
   
"
You
never
can
convince
me
,
"
said
Malderton
,
with
an
air
of
obstinate
determination
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
,
"
said
Mr
Frederick
,
following
up
his
father
's
attack
,
"
can
not
entirely
agree
in
Mr
Sparkins
's
argument
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Horatio
,
who
became
more
metaphysical
,
and
more
argumentative
,
as
he
saw
the
female
part
of
the
family
listening
in
wondering
delight
---
"
what
!
 
<EOS>
Is
effect
the
consequence
of
cause
?
 
<EOS>
Is
cause
the
precursor
of
effect
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
point
,
"
said
Flamwell
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Malderton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
if
effect
is
the
consequence
of
cause
,
and
if
cause
does
precede
effect
,
I
apprehend
you
are
wrong
,
"
added
Horatio
.
   
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
,
"
said
the
toad
-
eating
Flamwell
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
I
apprehend
that
to
be
the
just
and
logical
deduction
?
"
said
Sparkins
,
in
a
tone
of
interrogation
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
"
chimed
in
Flamwell
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
settles
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
it
does
,
"
said
Mr
Frederick
;
"
I
did
n't
see
it
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
exactly
see
it
now
,
"
thought
the
grocer
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
it
's
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
wonderfully
clever
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mrs
Malderton
to
her
daughters
,
as
they
retired
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
's
quite
a
love
!
"
<EOS>
said
both
the
young
ladies
together
;
"
he
talks
like
an
oracle
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
being
left
to
themselves
,
a
pause
ensued
,
during
which
everybody
looked
very
grave
,
as
if
they
were
quite
overcome
by
the
profound
nature
of
the
previous
discussion
.
 
<EOS>
Flamwell
,
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
find
out
who
and
what
<EOS>
Mr
Horatio
Sparkins
really
was
,
first
broke
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
"
said
that
distinguished
personage
,
"
I
presume
you
have
studied
for
the
bar
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
entering
once
,
myself
---
indeed
,
I
'm
rather
intimate
with
some
of
the
highest
ornaments
of
that
distinguished
profession
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
no
!
"
said
Horatio
,
with
a
little
hesitation
;
"
not
exactly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
been
much
among
the
silk
gowns
,
or
I
mistake
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Flamwell
,
deferentially
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nearly
all
my
life
,
"
returned
Sparkins
.
   
<EOS>
The
question
was
thus
pretty
well
settled
in
the
mind
of
Mr
Flamwell
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
gentleman
"
about
to
be
called
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
like
to
be
a
barrister
,
"
said
Tom
,
speaking
for
the
first
time
,
and
looking
round
the
table
to
find
somebody
who
would
notice
the
remark
.
   
<EOS>
No
one
made
any
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
like
to
wear
a
wig
,
"
said
Tom
,
hazarding
another
observation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
I
beg
you
will
not
make
yourself
ridiculous
,
"
said
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
listen
,
and
improve
yourself
by
the
conversation
you
hear
,
and
do
n't
be
constantly
making
these
absurd
remarks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
father
,
"
replied
the
unfortunate
Tom
,
who
had
not
spoken
a
word
since
he
had
asked
for
another
slice
of
beef
at
a
quarter
-
past
five
o'clock
,
PM
,
and
it
was
then
eight
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Tom
,
"
observed
his
good
-
natured
uncle
,
"
never
mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
like
to
wear
a
wig
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
wear
an
apron
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Malderton
coughed
violently
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barton
resumed
---
"
For
if
a
man
's
above
his
business
---
"
   
The
cough
returned
with
tenfold
violence
,
and
did
not
cease
until
the
unfortunate
cause
of
it
,
in
his
alarm
,
had
quite
forgotten
what
he
intended
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Sparkins
,
"
said
Flamwell
,
returning
to
the
charge
,
"
do
you
happen
to
know
Mr
Delafontaine
,
of
Bedford
-
square
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
exchanged
cards
with
him
;
since
which
,
indeed
,
I
have
had
an
opportunity
of
serving
him
considerably
,
"
replied
Horatio
,
<EOS>
slightly
colouring
;
no
doubt
,
at
having
been
betrayed
into
making
the
acknowledgment
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
lucky
,
if
you
have
had
an
opportunity
of
obliging
that
great
man
,
"
observed
Flamwell
,
with
an
air
of
profound
respect
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
who
he
is
,
"
he
whispered
to
Mr
Malderton
,
confidentially
,
as
they
followed
Horatio
up
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
clear
,
however
,
that
he
belongs
to
the
law
,
and
that
he
is
somebody
of
great
importance
,
and
very
highly
connected
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
no
doubt
,
"
returned
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
The
remainder
of
the
evening
passed
away
most
delightfully
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Malderton
,
relieved
from
his
apprehensions
by
the
circumstance
of
Mr
Barton
's
falling
into
a
profound
sleep
,
was
as
affable
and
gracious
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Teresa
played
the
"
Fall
of
Paris
,
"
as
Mr
Sparkins
declared
,
in
a
most
masterly
manner
,
and
both
of
them
,
assisted
by
Mr
Frederick
,
tried
over
glees
and
trios
without
number
;
they
having
made
the
pleasing
discovery
that
their
voices
harmonised
beautifully
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
they
all
sang
the
first
part
;
and
Horatio
,
in
addition
to
the
slight
drawback
of
having
no
ear
,
was
perfectly
innocent
of
knowing
a
note
of
music
;
still
,
they
passed
the
time
very
agreeably
,
and
it
was
past
twelve
o'clock
before
Mr
Sparkins
ordered
the
mourning
-
coach
-
looking
steed
to
be
brought
out
---
an
order
which
was
only
complied
with
,
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
he
was
to
repeat
his
visit
on
the
following
Sunday
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
Mr
Sparkins
will
form
one
of
our
party
to
-
morrow
evening
?
"
suggested
Mrs
M.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Malderton
intends
taking
the
girls
to
see
the
pantomime
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkins
bowed
,
and
promised
to
join
the
party
in
box
48
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
tax
you
for
the
morning
,
"
said
Miss
Teresa
,
bewitchingly
;
"
for
ma
is
going
to
take
us
to
all
sorts
of
places
,
shopping
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
gentlemen
have
a
great
horror
of
that
employment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkins
bowed
again
,
and
declared
that
he
should
be
delighted
,
but
business
of
importance
occupied
him
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Flamwell
looked
at
Malderton
significantly
.
<EOS>
---
"
It
's
term
time
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
.
   
<EOS>
At
twelve
o'clock
on
the
following
morning
,
the
"
fly
"
was
at
the
door
of
Oak
Lodge
,
to
convey
Mrs
Malderton
and
her
daughters
on
their
expedition
for
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
to
dine
and
dress
for
the
play
at
a
friend
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
driving
thither
with
their
band
-
boxes
,
they
departed
on
their
first
errand
to
make
some
purchases
at
Messrs.
Jones
,
Spruggins
,
and
Smith
's
,
of
Tottenham
-
court
-
road
;
after
which
,
they
were
to
go
to
Redmayne
's
in
Bond
-
street
;
thence
,
to
innumerable
places
that
no
one
ever
heard
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
beguiled
the
tediousness
of
the
ride
by
eulogising
Mr
Horatio
Sparkins
,
scolding
their
mamma
for
taking
them
so
far
to
save
a
shilling
,
and
wondering
whether
they
should
ever
reach
their
destination
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
vehicle
stopped
before
a
dirty
-
looking
ticketed
linen
-
draper
's
shop
,
with
goods
of
all
kinds
,
and
labels
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
,
in
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
dropsical
figures
of
seven
with
a
little
three
-
farthings
in
the
corner
;
"
perfectly
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
;
"
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
ladies
'
boas
,
FROM
one
shilling
and
a
penny
halfpenny
;
real
French
kid
shoes
,
at
two
and
ninepence
per
pair
;
green
parasols
,
at
an
equally
cheap
rate
;
and
"
every
description
of
goods
,
"
as
the
proprietors
said
---
and
they
must
know
best
---
"
fifty

<EOS>
"
Lor

ma

what
a
place
you
have
brought
us
to

"
said
Miss
Teresa
;
"
what
WOULD
Mr
Sparkins
say
if
he
could
see
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah

<EOS>
what
,
indeed

<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Marianne
,
horrified
at
the
idea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
seated
,
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
first
article
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
obsequious
master
of
the
ceremonies
of
the
establishment
,
who
,
in
his
large
white
neckcloth
and
formal
tie
,
looked
like
a
bad
"
portrait
of
a
gentleman
"
in
the
Somerset
-
house
exhibition
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
some
silks
,
"
answered
Mrs
Malderton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Directly
,
ma'am
.
---
Mr
Smith
!
 
<EOS>
Where
IS
Mr
Smith
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
sir
,
"
cried
a
voice
at
the
back
of
the
shop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
make
haste
,
Mr
Smith
,
"
said
the
M*C.
 
<EOS>
"
You
never
are
to
be
found
when
you
're
wanted
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Smith
,
thus
enjoined
to
use
all
possible
despatch
,
leaped
over
the
counter
with
great
agility
,
and
placed
himself
before
the
newly
-
arrived
customers
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Malderton
uttered
a
faint
scream
;
Miss
Teresa
,
who
had
been
stooping
down
to
talk
to
her
sister
,
raised
her
head
,
and
beheld
---
<EOS>
Horatio
Sparkins
!
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
draw
a
veil
,
"
as
novel
-
writers
say
,
over
the
scene
that
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
The
mysterious
,
philosophical
,
romantic
,
metaphysical
Sparkins
---
he
who
,
to
the
interesting
Teresa
,
seemed
like
the
embodied
idea
of
the
young
dukes
and
poetical
exquisites
in
blue
silk
dressing
-
gowns
,
and
ditto
ditto
slippers
,
of
whom
she
had
read
and
dreamed
,
but
had
never
expected
to
behold
,
was
suddenly
converted
into
Mr
Samuel
Smith
,
the
assistant
at
a
"
cheap
shop
;
"
the
junior
partner
in
a
slippery
firm
of
some
three
weeks
'
existence
.
 
<EOS>
The
dignified
evanishment
of
the
hero
of
Oak
Lodge
,
on
this
unexpected
recognition
,
could
only
be
equalled
by
that
of
a
furtive
dog
with
a
considerable
kettle
at
his
tail
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
hopes
of
the
Maldertons
were
destined
at
once
to
melt
away
,
like
the
lemon
ices
at
a
Company
's
dinner
;
Almack
's
was
still
to
them
as
distant
as
the
North
Pole
;
and
Miss
Teresa
had
as
much
chance
of
a
husband
as
Captain
Ross
had
of
the
north
-
west
passage
.
   
<EOS>
Years
have
elapsed
since
the
occurrence
of
this
dreadful
morning
.
<EOS>
The
daisies
have
thrice
bloomed
on
Camberwell
-
green
;
the
sparrows
have
thrice
repeated
their
vernal
chirps
in
Camberwell
-
grove
;
but
the
Miss
Maldertons
are
still
unmated
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Teresa
's
case
is
more
desperate
than
ever
;
but
Flamwell
is
yet
in
the
zenith
of
his
reputation
;
and
the
family
have
the
same
predilection
for
aristocratic
personages
,
with
an
increased
aversion
to
anything
LOW
.
   
<EOS>
The
Black
Veil
<EOS>
One
winter
's
evening
,
towards
the
close
of
the
year
1800
,
or
within
a
year
or
two
of
that
time
,
a
young
medical
practitioner
,
recently
established
in
business
,
was
seated
by
a
cheerful
fire
in
his
little
parlour
,
listening
to
the
wind
which
was
beating
the
rain
in
pattering
drops
against
the
window
,
or
rumbling
dismally
in
the
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
wet
and
cold
;
he
had
been
walking
through
mud
and
water
the
whole
day
,
and
was
now
comfortably
reposing
in
his
dressing
-
gown
and
slippers
,
more
than
half
asleep
and
less
than
half
awake
,
revolving
a
thousand
matters
in
his
wandering
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
he
thought
how
hard
the
wind
was
blowing
,
and
how
the
cold
,
sharp
rain
would
be
at
that
moment
beating
in
his
face
,
if
he
were
not
comfortably
housed
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
his
mind
reverted
to
his
annual
Christmas
visit
to
his
native
place
and
dearest
friends
;
he
thought
how
glad
they
would
all
be
to
see
him
,
and
how
happy
it
would
make
Rose
if
he
could
only
tell
her
that
he
had
found
a
patient
at
last
,
and
hoped
to
have
more
,
and
to
come
down
again
,
in
a
few
months
'
time
,
and
marry
her
,
and
take
her
home
to
gladden
his
lonely
fireside
,
and
stimulate
him
to
fresh
exertions
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
began
to
wonder
when
his
first
patient
would
appear
,
or
whether
he
was
destined
,
by
a
special
dispensation
of
Providence
,
never
to
have
any
patients
at
all
;
and
then
,
he
thought
about
Rose
again
,
and
dropped
to
sleep
and
dreamed
about
her
,
till
the
tones
of
her
sweet
merry
voice
sounded
in
his
ears
,
and
her
soft
tiny
hand
rested
on
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
There
WAS
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
but
it
was
neither
soft
nor
tiny
;
its
owner
being
a
corpulent
round
-
headed
boy
,
who
,
in
consideration
of
the
sum
of
one
shilling
per
week
and
his
food
,
was
let
out
by
the
parish
to
carry
medicine
and
messages
.
 
<EOS>
As
there
was
no
demand
for
the
medicine
,
however
,
and
no
necessity
for
the
messages
,
he
usually
occupied
his
unemployed
hours
---
averaging
fourteen
a
day
---
in
abstracting
peppermint
drops
,
taking
animal
nourishment
,
and
going
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
lady
,
sir
---
a
lady
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
the
boy
,
rousing
his
master
with
a
shake
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
lady
?
<EOS>
"
cried
our
friend
,
starting
up
,
not
quite
certain
that
his
dream
was
an
illusion
,
and
half
expecting
that
it
might
be
Rose
herself
.
<EOS>
---
"
What
lady
?
 
<EOS>
Where
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
THERE
,
sir
!
"
replied
the
boy
,
pointing
to
the
glass
door
leading
into
the
surgery
,
with
an
expression
of
alarm
which
the
very
unusual
apparition
of
a
customer
might
have
tended
to
excite
.
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
looked
towards
the
door
,
and
started
himself
,
for
an
instant
,
on
beholding
the
appearance
of
his
unlooked
-
for
visitor
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
singularly
tall
woman
,
dressed
in
deep
mourning
,
and
standing
so
close
to
the
door
that
her
face
almost
touched
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
The
upper
part
of
her
figure
was
carefully
muffled
in
a
black
shawl
,
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
concealment
;
and
her
face
was
shrouded
by
a
thick
black
veil
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
perfectly
erect
,
her
figure
was
drawn
up
to
its
full
height
,
and
though
the
surgeon
felt
that
the
eyes
beneath
the
veil
were
fixed
on
him
,
she
stood
perfectly
motionless
,
and
evinced
,
by
no
gesture
<EOS>
whatever
,
the
slightest
consciousness
of
his
having
turned
towards
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
wish
to
consult
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
with
some
hesitation
,
holding
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
opened
inwards
,
and
therefore
the
action
did
not
alter
the
position
of
the
figure
,
which
still
remained
motionless
on
the
same
spot
.
   
<EOS>
She
slightly
inclined
her
head
,
in
token
of
acquiescence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
walk
in
,
"
said
the
surgeon
.
   
<EOS>
The
figure
moved
a
step
forward
;
and
then
,
turning
its
head
in
the
direction
of
the
boy
---
to
his
infinite
horror
---
appeared
to
hesitate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
room
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
addressing
the
boy
,
whose
large
round
eyes
had
been
extended
to
their
utmost
width
during
this
brief
interview
.
 
<EOS>
"
Draw
the
curtain
,
and
shut
the
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
boy
drew
a
green
curtain
across
the
glass
part
of
the
door
,
retired
into
the
surgery
,
closed
the
door
after
him
,
and
immediately
applied
one
of
his
large
eyes
to
the
keyhole
on
the
other
side
.
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
,
and
motioned
the
visitor
to
a
seat
.
 
<EOS>
The
mysterious
figure
slowly
moved
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
blaze
shone
upon
the
black
dress
,
the
surgeon
observed
that
the
bottom
of
it
was
saturated
with
mud
and
rain
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
wet
,
"
be
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
in
a
low
deep
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
are
ill
?
<EOS>
"
added
the
surgeon
,
compassionately
,
for
the
tone
was
that
of
a
person
in
pain
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
was
the
reply
---
"
very
ill
;
not
bodily
,
but
mentally
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
myself
,
or
on
my
own
behalf
,
"
continued
the
stranger
,
"
that
I
come
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
laboured
under
bodily
disease
,
I
should
not
be
out
,
alone
,
at
such
an
hour
,
or
on
such
a
night
as
this
;
and
if
I
were
afflicted
with
it
,
twenty
-
four
hours
hence
,
God
knows
how
gladly
I
would
lie
down
and
pray
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
for
another
that
I
beseech
your
aid
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
mad
to
ask
it
for
him
<EOS>
---
I
think
I
am
;
but
,
night
after
night
,
through
the
long
dreary
hours
of
watching
and
weeping
,
the
thought
has
been
ever
present
to
my
mind
;
and
though
even
I
see
the
hopelessness
of
human
assistance
availing
him
,
the
bare
thought
of
laying
him
in
his
grave
without
it
makes
my
blood
run
cold
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
a
shudder
,
such
as
the
surgeon
well
knew
art
could
not
produce
,
trembled
through
the
speaker
's
frame
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
desperate
earnestness
in
this
woman
's
manner
,
<EOS>
that
went
to
the
young
man
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
young
in
his
profession
,
and
had
not
yet
witnessed
enough
of
the
miseries
which
are
daily
presented
before
the
eyes
of
its
members
,
to
have
grown
comparatively
callous
to
human
suffering
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
,
"
he
said
,
rising
hastily
,
"
the
person
of
whom
you
speak
,
be
in
so
hopeless
a
condition
as
you
describe
,
not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
with
you
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
not
obtain
medical
advice
before
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
it
would
have
been
useless
before
---
because
it
is
useless
even
now
,
"
replied
the
woman
,
clasping
her
hands
passionately
.
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
gazed
,
for
a
moment
,
on
the
black
veil
,
as
if
to
ascertain
the
expression
of
the
features
beneath
it
:
 
its
thickness
,
however
,
rendered
such
a
result
impossible
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ARE
ill
,
"
he
said
,
gently
,
"
although
you
do
not
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
fever
which
has
enabled
you
to
bear
,
without
feeling
it
,
the
fatigue
you
have
evidently
undergone
,
is
burning
within
you
now
.
<EOS>
Put
that
to
your
lips
,
"
he
continued
,
pouring
out
a
glass
of
water
---
"
compose
yourself
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
tell
me
,
as
calmly
as
you
can
,
what
the
disease
of
the
patient
is
,
and
how
long
he
has
been
ill
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
know
what
it
is
necessary
I
should
know
,
to
render
my
visit
serviceable
to
him
,
I
am
ready
to
accompany
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
lifted
the
glass
of
water
to
her
mouth
,
without
raising
the
veil
;
put
it
down
again
untasted
;
and
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
she
said
,
sobbing
aloud
,
"
that
what
I
say
to
you
now
,
seems
like
the
ravings
of
fever
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
told
so
before
,
less
kindly
than
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
young
woman
;
and
they
do
say
,
that
as
life
steals
on
towards
its
final
close
,
the
last
short
remnant
,
worthless
as
it
may
seem
to
all
beside
,
is
dearer
to
its
possessor
than
all
the
years
that
have
gone
before
,
connected
though
they
be
with
the
recollection
of
old
friends
long
since
dead
,
and
young
ones
---
children
perhaps
---
who
have
fallen
off
from
,
and
forgotten
one
as
completely
as
if
they
had
died
too
.
 
<EOS>
My
natural
term
of
life
can
not
be
many
years
longer
,
and
should
be
dear
on
that
account
;
but
I
would
lay
it
down
without
a
sigh
---
with
cheerfulness
---
with
joy
---
if
what
I
tell
you
now
,
were
only
false
,
or
imaginary
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
morning
he
of
whom
I
speak
will
be
,
I
KNOW
,
though
I
would
fain
think
otherwise
,
beyond
the
reach
of
human
aid
;
and
yet
,
to
-
night
,
though
he
is
in
deadly
peril
,
you
must
not
see
,
and
could
not
serve
,
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
unwilling
to
increase
your
distress
,
"
said
the
surgeon
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
by
making
any
comment
on
what
you
have
just
said
,
or
appearing
desirous
to
investigate
a
subject
you
are
so
anxious
to
conceal
;
but
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
your
statement
which
I
can
not
reconcile
with
probability
.
 
<EOS>
This
person
is
dying
to
-
night
,
and
I
can
not
see
him
when
my
assistance
might
possibly
avail
<EOS>
;
you
apprehend
it
will
be
useless
to
-
morrow
,
and
yet
you
would
have
<EOS>
me
see
him
then
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
be
,
indeed
,
as
dear
to
you
,
as
your
words
and
manner
would
imply
,
why
not
try
to
save
his
life
before
delay
and
the
progress
of
his
disease
render
it
impracticable
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
help
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
woman
,
weeping
bitterly
,
"
how
can
I
hope
strangers
will
believe
what
appears
incredible
,
even
to
myself
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
NOT
see
him
then
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
she
added
,
rising
suddenly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
that
I
declined
to
see
him
,
"
replied
the
surgeon
;
"
but
I
warn
you
,
that
if
you
persist
in
this
extraordinary
procrastination
,
and
the
individual
dies
,
a
fearful
responsibility
rests
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
responsibility
will
rest
heavily
somewhere
,
"
replied
the
stranger
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whatever
responsibility
rests
with
me
,
I
am
content
to
bear
,
and
ready
to
answer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
incur
none
,
"
continued
the
surgeon
,
"
by
acceding
to
your
request
,
I
will
see
him
in
the
morning
,
if
you
leave
me
the
address
.
 
<EOS>
At
what
hour
can
he
be
seen
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
NINE
,
"
replied
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
excuse
my
pressing
these
inquiries
,
"
said
the
surgeon
.
<EOS>
"
But
is
he
in
your
charge
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
,
"
was
the
rejoinder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
if
I
gave
you
instructions
for
his
treatment
through
the
night
,
you
could
not
assist
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
woman
wept
bitterly
,
as
she
replied
,
"
I
could
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
Finding
that
there
was
but
little
prospect
of
obtaining
more
information
by
prolonging
the
interview
;
and
anxious
to
spare
the
woman
's
feelings
,
which
,
subdued
at
first
by
a
violent
effort
,
were
now
irrepressible
and
most
painful
to
witness
;
the
surgeon
repeated
his
promise
of
calling
in
the
morning
at
the
appointed
hour
.
 
<EOS>
His
visitor
,
after
giving
him
a
direction
to
an
obscure
part
of
Walworth
,
left
the
house
in
the
same
mysterious
manner
in
which
she
had
entered
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
will
be
readily
believed
that
so
extraordinary
a
visit
produced
a
considerable
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
young
surgeon
;
and
that
he
speculated
a
great
deal
and
to
very
little
purpose
on
the
possible
circumstances
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
In
common
with
the
generality
of
people
,
he
had
often
heard
and
read
of
singular
instances
,
in
which
a
presentiment
of
death
,
at
a
particular
day
,
or
even
minute
,
had
been
entertained
and
realised
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
moment
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
present
might
be
such
a
case
;
but
,
then
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
all
the
anecdotes
of
the
kind
he
had
ever
heard
,
were
of
persons
who
had
been
troubled
with
a
foreboding
of
their
own
death
.
 
<EOS>
This
woman
,
however
,
spoke
of
another
person
---
a
man
;
and
it
was
impossible
to
suppose
that
a
mere
dream
or
delusion
of
fancy
would
induce
her
to
speak
of
his
approaching
dissolution
with
such
terrible
certainty
as
she
had
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
that
the
man
was
to
be
murdered
in
the
morning
,
and
that
the
woman
,
originally
a
consenting
party
,
and
bound
to
secrecy
by
an
oath
,
had
relented
,
and
,
though
unable
to
prevent
the
commission
of
some
outrage
on
the
victim
,
had
determined
to
prevent
his
death
if
possible
,
by
the
timely
interposition
of
medical
aid
?
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
such
things
happening
within
two
miles
of
the
metropolis
appeared
too
wild
and
preposterous
to
be
entertained
beyond
the
instant
.
<EOS>
Then
,
his
original
impression
that
the
woman
's
intellects
were
disordered
,
recurred
;
and
,
as
it
was
the
only
mode
of
solving
the
difficulty
with
any
degree
of
satisfaction
,
he
obstinately
made
up
his
mind
to
believe
that
she
was
mad
.
 
<EOS>
Certain
misgivings
upon
this
point
,
however
,
stole
upon
his
thoughts
at
the
time
,
and
presented
themselves
again
and
again
through
the
long
dull
course
of
a
sleepless
night
;
during
which
,
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
the
contrary
,
he
was
unable
to
banish
the
black
veil
from
his
disturbed
imagination
.
   
<EOS>
The
back
part
of
Walworth
,
at
its
greatest
distance
from
town
,
is
a
straggling
miserable
place
enough
,
even
in
these
days
;
but
,
five
-
and
-
thirty
years
ago
,
the
greater
portion
of
it
was
little
better
than
a
dreary
waste
,
inhabited
by
a
few
scattered
people
of
questionable
character
,
whose
poverty
prevented
their
living
in
any
better
neighbourhood
,
or
whose
pursuits
and
mode
of
life
rendered
its
solitude
desirable
.
 
<EOS>
Very
many
of
the
houses
which
have
since
sprung
up
on
all
sides
,
were
not
built
until
some
years
afterwards
;
and
the
great
majority
even
of
those
which
were
sprinkled
about
,
at
irregular
intervals
,
were
of
the
rudest
and
most
miserable
description
.
   
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
place
through
which
he
walked
in
the
morning
,
was
not
calculated
to
raise
the
spirits
of
the
young
surgeon
,
or
to
dispel
any
feeling
of
anxiety
or
depression
which
the
singular
kind
of
visit
<EOS>
he
was
about
to
make
,
had
awakened
.
 
<EOS>
Striking
off
from
the
high
road
,
his
way
lay
across
a
marshy
common
,
through
irregular
lanes
,
with
here
and
there
a
ruinous
and
dismantled
cottage
fast
falling
to
pieces
with
decay
and
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
A
stunted
tree
,
or
pool
of
stagnant
water
,
roused
into
a
sluggish
action
by
the
heavy
rain
of
the
preceding
night
,
skirted
the
path
occasionally
;
and
,
now
and
then
,
a
miserable
patch
of
garden
-
ground
,
with
a
few
old
boards
knocked
together
for
a
summer
-
house
,
and
old
palings
imperfectly
mended
with
stakes
pilfered
from
the
neighbouring
hedges
,
bore
testimony
,
at
once
to
the
poverty
of
the
inhabitants
,
and
the
little
scruple
they
entertained
in
appropriating
the
property
of
other
people
to
their
own
use
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
a
filthy
-
looking
woman
would
make
her
appearance
from
the
door
of
a
dirty
house
,
to
empty
the
contents
of
some
cooking
utensil
into
the
gutter
in
front
,
or
to
scream
after
a
little
slip
-
shod
girl
,
who
had
contrived
to
stagger
a
few
yards
from
the
door
under
the
weight
of
a
sallow
infant
almost
as
big
as
herself
;
but
,
scarcely
anything
was
stirring
around
:
 
and
so
much
of
the
prospect
as
could
be
faintly
traced
through
the
cold
damp
mist
which
hung
heavily
over
it
,
presented
a
lonely
and
dreary
appearance
perfectly
in
keeping
with
the
objects
we
have
described
.
   
<EOS>
After
plodding
wearily
through
the
mud
and
mire
;
making
many
inquiries
for
the
place
to
which
he
had
been
directed
;
and
receiving
as
many
contradictory
and
unsatisfactory
replies
in
return
;
the
young
man
at
length
arrived
before
the
house
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
as
the
object
of
his
destination
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
low
building
,
one
story
above
the
ground
,
with
even
a
more
desolate
and
unpromising
exterior
than
any
he
had
yet
passed
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
yellow
curtain
was
closely
drawn
across
the
window
up
-
stairs
,
and
the
parlour
shutters
were
closed
,
but
not
fastened
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
detached
from
any
other
,
and
,
as
it
stood
at
an
angle
of
a
narrow
lane
,
there
was
no
other
habitation
in
sight
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
say
that
the
surgeon
hesitated
,
and
walked
a
few
paces
beyond
the
house
,
before
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
lift
the
knocker
,
we
say
nothing
that
need
raise
a
smile
upon
the
face
of
the
boldest
reader
.
 
<EOS>
The
police
of
London
were
a
very
different
body
in
that
day
;
the
isolated
position
of
the
suburbs
,
when
the
rage
for
building
and
the
progress
of
improvement
had
not
yet
begun
to
connect
them
with
the
main
body
of
the
city
and
its
environs
,
rendered
many
of
them
(
and
this
in
particular
)
<EOS>
a
place
of
resort
for
the
worst
and
most
depraved
characters
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
streets
in
the
gayest
parts
of
London
were
imperfectly
lighted
,
at
that
time
;
and
such
places
as
these
,
were
left
entirely
to
the
mercy
of
the
moon
and
stars
.
 
<EOS>
The
chances
of
detecting
desperate
characters
,
or
of
tracing
them
to
their
haunts
,
were
thus
rendered
very
few
,
and
their
offences
naturally
increased
in
boldness
,
as
the
consciousness
of
comparative
security
became
the
more
impressed
upon
them
by
daily
experience
.
 
<EOS>
Added
to
these
considerations
,
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
young
man
had
spent
some
time
in
the
public
hospitals
of
the
metropolis
;
and
,
although
neither
Burke
nor
Bishop
had
then
gained
a
horrible
notoriety
,
his
own
observation
might
have
suggested
to
him
how
easily
the
atrocities
to
which
the
former
has
since
given
his
name
,
might
be
committed
.
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
whatever
reflection
made
him
hesitate
,
he
DID
hesitate
:
 
but
,
being
a
young
man
of
strong
mind
and
great
personal
courage
,
it
was
only
for
an
instant
;
---
he
stepped
briskly
back
and
knocked
gently
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
A
low
whispering
was
audible
,
immediately
afterwards
,
as
if
some
person
at
the
end
of
the
passage
were
conversing
stealthily
with
another
on
the
landing
above
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
succeeded
by
the
noise
of
a
pair
of
heavy
boots
upon
the
bare
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
-
chain
was
softly
unfastened
;
the
door
opened
;
and
a
tall
,
ill
-
favoured
man
,
with
black
hair
,
and
a
face
,
as
the
surgeon
often
declared
afterwards
,
as
pale
and
haggard
,
as
the
countenance
of
any
dead
man
he
ever
saw
,
presented
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Walk
in
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
in
a
low
tone
.
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
did
so
,
and
the
man
having
secured
the
door
again
,
by
the
chain
,
led
the
way
to
a
small
back
parlour
at
the
extremity
of
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
in
time
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
soon
!
"
replied
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
surgeon
turned
hastily
round
,
with
a
gesture
of
astonishment
not
unmixed
with
alarm
,
which
he
found
it
impossible
to
repress
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
step
in
here
,
sir
,
"
said
the
man
,
who
had
evidently
noticed
the
action
---
"
if
you
'll
step
in
here
,
sir
,
you
wo
n't
be
detained
five
minutes
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
at
once
walked
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
closed
the
door
,
and
left
him
alone
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
cold
room
,
with
no
other
furniture
than
two
deal
chairs
,
and
a
table
of
the
same
material
.
 
<EOS>
A
handful
of
fire
,
unguarded
by
any
fender
,
was
burning
in
the
grate
,
which
brought
out
the
damp
if
it
served
no
more
comfortable
purpose
,
for
the
unwholesome
moisture
was
stealing
down
the
walls
,
in
long
slug
-
like
tracks
.
 
<EOS>
The
window
,
which
was
broken
and
patched
in
many
places
,
looked
into
a
small
enclosed
piece
of
ground
,
almost
covered
with
water
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
,
either
within
the
house
,
or
without
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
surgeon
sat
down
by
the
fireplace
,
to
await
the
result
of
his
first
professional
visit
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
not
remained
in
this
position
many
minutes
,
when
the
noise
of
some
approaching
vehicle
struck
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
It
stopped
;
the
street
-
door
was
opened
;
a
low
talking
succeeded
,
accompanied
with
a
shuffling
noise
of
footsteps
,
along
the
passage
and
on
the
stairs
,
as
if
two
or
three
men
were
engaged
in
carrying
some
heavy
body
to
the
room
above
.
 
<EOS>
The
creaking
of
the
stairs
,
a
few
seconds
afterwards
,
announced
that
the
new
-
comers
having
completed
their
task
,
whatever
it
was
,
were
leaving
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
again
closed
,
and
the
former
silence
was
restored
.
   
<EOS>
Another
five
minutes
had
elapsed
,
and
the
surgeon
had
resolved
to
explore
the
house
,
in
search
of
some
one
to
whom
he
might
make
his
errand
known
,
when
the
room
-
door
opened
,
and
his
last
night
's
visitor
,
dressed
in
exactly
the
same
manner
,
with
the
veil
lowered
as
before
,
motioned
him
to
advance
.
 
<EOS>
The
singular
height
of
her
form
,
coupled
with
the
circumstance
of
her
not
speaking
,
caused
the
idea
to
pass
across
his
brain
for
an
instant
,
that
it
might
be
a
man
disguised
in
woman
's
attire
.
 
<EOS>
The
hysteric
sobs
which
issued
from
beneath
the
veil
,
and
the
convulsive
attitude
of
grief
of
the
whole
figure
,
however
,
at
once
exposed
the
absurdity
of
the
suspicion
;
and
he
hastily
followed
.
   
<EOS>
The
woman
led
the
way
up
-
stairs
to
the
front
room
,
and
paused
at
the
door
,
to
let
him
enter
first
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
scantily
furnished
with
an
old
deal
box
,
a
few
chairs
,
and
a
tent
bedstead
,
without
hangings
or
cross
-
rails
,
which
was
covered
with
a
patchwork
counterpane
.
 
<EOS>
The
dim
light
admitted
through
the
curtain
which
he
had
noticed
from
the
outside
,
rendered
the
objects
in
the
room
so
indistinct
,
and
communicated
to
all
of
them
so
uniform
a
hue
,
that
he
did
not
,
at
first
,
perceive
the
object
on
which
his
eye
at
once
rested
when
the
woman
rushed
frantically
past
him
,
and
flung
herself
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
.
   
<EOS>
Stretched
upon
the
bed
,
closely
enveloped
in
a
linen
wrapper
,
and
covered
with
blankets
,
lay
a
human
form
,
stiff
and
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
The
head
and
face
,
which
were
those
of
a
man
,
were
uncovered
,
save
by
a
bandage
which
passed
over
the
head
and
under
the
chin
.
 
<EOS>
The
eyes
were
closed
.
 
<EOS>
The
left
arm
lay
heavily
across
the
bed
,
and
the
woman
held
the
passive
hand
.
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
gently
pushed
the
woman
aside
,
and
took
the
hand
in
his
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
letting
it
fall
involuntarily
---
"
the
man
is
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
woman
started
to
her
feet
and
beat
her
hands
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
do
n't
say
so
,
sir
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
with
a
burst
of
passion
,
amounting
almost
to
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
n't
say
so
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
it
!
 
<EOS>
Men
have
been
brought
to
life
,
before
,
when
unskilful
people
have
given
them
up
for
lost
;
and
men
have
died
,
who
might
have
been
restored
,
if
proper
means
had
been
resorted
to
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
him
lie
here
,
sir
,
without
one
effort
to
save
him
!
 
<EOS>
This
very
moment
life
may
be
passing
away
.
 
<EOS>
Do
try
,
sir
,
---
do
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
"
<EOS>
---
And
while
speaking
,
she
hurriedly
chafed
,
first
the
forehead
,
and
then
the
breast
,
of
the
senseless
form
before
her
;
and
then
,
wildly
beat
the
cold
hands
,
which
,
when
she
ceased
to
hold
them
,
fell
listlessly
and
heavily
back
on
the
coverlet
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
no
use
,
my
good
woman
,
"
said
the
surgeon
,
soothingly
,
as
he
withdrew
his
hand
from
the
man
's
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
---
undraw
that
curtain
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
woman
,
starting
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Undraw
that
curtain
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
surgeon
in
an
agitated
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
darkened
the
room
on
purpose
,
"
said
the
woman
,
throwing
herself
before
him
as
he
rose
to
undraw
it
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
sir
,
have
pity
on
me
!
<EOS>
If
it
can
be
of
no
use
,
and
he
is
really
dead
,
do
not
expose
that
form
to
other
eyes
than
mine
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
man
died
no
natural
or
easy
death
,
"
said
the
surgeon
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
MUST
see
the
body
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
a
motion
so
sudden
,
that
the
woman
hardly
knew
that
he
had
slipped
from
beside
her
,
he
tore
open
the
curtain
,
admitted
the
full
light
of
day
,
and
returned
to
the
bedside
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
violence
here
,
"
he
said
,
pointing
towards
the
body
,
and
gazing
intently
on
the
face
,
from
which
the
black
veil
was
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
removed
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
excitement
of
a
minute
before
,
the
female
had
thrown
off
the
bonnet
and
veil
,
and
now
stood
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Her
features
were
those
of
a
woman
about
fifty
,
who
had
once
been
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
Sorrow
and
weeping
had
left
traces
upon
them
which
not
time
itself
would
ever
have
produced
without
their
aid
;
her
face
was
deadly
pale
;
and
there
was
a
nervous
contortion
of
the
lip
,
and
an
unnatural
fire
in
her
eye
,
which
showed
too
plainly
that
her
bodily
and
mental
powers
had
nearly
sunk
,
beneath
an
accumulation
of
misery
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
violence
here
,
"
said
the
surgeon
,
preserving
his
searching
glance
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
has
!
"
replied
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
man
has
been
murdered
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
call
God
to
witness
he
has
,
"
said
the
woman
,
passionately
;
"
pitilessly
,
inhumanly
murdered
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
whom
?
"
said
the
surgeon
,
seizing
the
woman
by
the
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
the
butchers
'
marks
,
and
then
ask
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
.
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
turned
his
face
towards
the
bed
,
and
bent
over
the
body
which
now
lay
full
in
the
light
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
The
throat
was
swollen
,
and
a
livid
mark
encircled
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
flashed
suddenly
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
one
of
the
men
who
were
hanged
this
morning
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
turning
away
with
a
shudder
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
the
woman
,
with
a
cold
,
unmeaning
stare
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
was
he
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
surgeon
.
   
<EOS>
"
MY
SON
,
"
rejoined
the
woman
;
and
fell
senseless
at
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
true
.
 
<EOS>
A
companion
,
equally
guilty
with
himself
,
had
been
acquitted
for
want
of
evidence
;
and
this
man
had
been
left
for
death
,
and
executed
.
 
<EOS>
To
recount
the
circumstances
of
the
case
,
at
this
distant
period
,
must
be
unnecessary
,
and
might
give
pain
to
some
persons
still
alive
.
 
<EOS>
The
history
was
an
every
-
day
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
mother
was
a
widow
without
friends
or
money
,
and
had
denied
herself
necessaries
to
bestow
them
on
her
orphan
boy
.
 
<EOS>
That
boy
,
unmindful
of
her
prayers
,
and
forgetful
of
the
sufferings
she
had
endured
for
him
---
incessant
anxiety
of
mind
,
and
voluntary
starvation
of
body
---
had
plunged
into
a
career
of
dissipation
and
crime
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
result
;
his
own
death
by
the
hangman
's
hands
,
and
his
mother
's
shame
,
and
incurable
insanity
.
   
<EOS>
For
many
years
after
this
occurrence
,
and
when
profitable
and
arduous
avocations
would
have
led
many
men
to
forget
that
such
a
miserable
being
existed
,
the
young
surgeon
was
a
daily
visitor
at
the
side
of
the
harmless
mad
woman
;
not
only
soothing
her
by
his
presence
and
kindness
,
but
alleviating
the
rigour
of
her
condition
by
pecuniary
donations
for
her
comfort
and
support
,
bestowed
with
no
sparing
hand
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
transient
gleam
of
recollection
and
consciousness
which
preceded
her
death
,
a
prayer
for
his
welfare
and
protection
,
as
fervent
as
mortal
ever
breathed
,
rose
from
the
lips
of
this
poor
friendless
creature
.
 
<EOS>
That
prayer
flew
to
Heaven
,
and
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
The
blessings
he
was
instrumental
in
conferring
,
have
been
repaid
to
him
a
thousand
-
fold
;
but
,
amid
all
the
honours
of
rank
and
station
which
have
since
been
heaped
upon
him
,
and
which
he
has
so
well
earned
,
he
can
have
no
reminiscence
more
gratifying
to
his
heart
than
that
connected
with
The
Black
Veil
.
   
<EOS>
The
steam
excursion
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
was
a
law
student
,
inhabiting
a
set
of
chambers
on
the
fourth
floor
,
in
one
of
those
houses
in
Gray's
-
inn
-
square
which
command
an
extensive
view
of
the
gardens
,
and
their
usual
adjuncts
---
flaunting
nursery
-
maids
,
and
town
-
made
children
,
with
parenthetical
legs
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
was
what
is
generally
termed
---
"
a
devilish
good
fellow
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
large
circle
of
acquaintance
,
and
seldom
dined
at
his
own
expense
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
to
talk
politics
to
papas
,
flatter
the
vanity
of
mammas
,
do
the
amiable
to
their
daughters
,
make
pleasure
engagements
with
their
sons
,
and
romp
with
the
younger
branches
.
 
<EOS>
Like
those
paragons
of
perfection
,
advertising
footmen
out
of
place
,
he
was
always
"
willing
to
make
himself
generally
useful
.
"
 
<EOS>
If
any
old
lady
,
whose
son
was
in
India
,
gave
a
ball
,
Mr
Percy
Noakes
was
master
of
the
ceremonies
;
if
any
young
lady
made
a
stolen
match
,
Mr
Percy
Noakes
gave
her
away
;
if
a
juvenile
wife
presented
her
husband
with
a
blooming
cherub
,
Mr
Percy
Noakes
was
either
godfather
,
or
deputy
-
godfather
;
and
if
any
member
of
a
friend
's
family
died
,
Mr
Percy
Noakes
was
invariably
to
be
seen
in
the
second
mourning
coach
,
with
a
white
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
,
sobbing
---
to
use
his
own
appropriate
and
expressive
description
---
"
like
winkin
'
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
may
readily
be
imagined
that
these
numerous
avocations
were
rather
calculated
to
interfere
with
Mr
Percy
Noakes
's
professional
studies
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
,
and
had
,
therefore
,
after
mature
reflection
,
made
up
his
mind
not
to
study
at
all
---
a
laudable
determination
,
to
which
he
adhered
in
the
most
praiseworthy
manner
.
 
<EOS>
His
sitting
-
room
presented
a
strange
chaos
of
dress
-
gloves
,
boxing
-
gloves
,
caricatures
,
albums
,
invitation
-
cards
,
foils
,
cricket
-
bats
,
cardboard
drawings
,
paste
,
gum
,
and
fifty
other
miscellaneous
articles
,
heaped
together
in
the
strangest
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
making
something
for
somebody
,
or
planning
some
party
of
pleasure
,
which
was
his
great
FORTE
.
 
<EOS>
He
invariably
spoke
with
astonishing
rapidity
;
was
smart
,
spoffish
,
and
eight
-
and
-
twenty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Splendid
idea
,
"
pon

"
<EOS>
soliloquised
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
over
his
morning
coffee
,
as
his
mind
reverted
to
a
suggestion
which
had
been
thrown
out
on
the
previous
night
,
by
a
lady
at
whose
house
he
had
spent
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
"
Glorious
idea

Mrs
Stubbs

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir

"
replied
a
dirty
old
woman
with
an
inflamed
countenance
,
emerging
from
the
bedroom
,
with
a
barrel
of
dirt
and
cinders
.
<EOS>
---
This
was
the
laundress
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
call

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
Mrs
Stubbs
,
I

going
out

<EOS>
If
that
tailor
should
call
again

you
'd
better
say
I
'm
out
of
town

and
sha

be
back

and
if
that
bootmaker
should
come
,
tell
him
I
've
lost
his

or
I
'd
have
sent
him
that
little

Mind

he
writes
it
down

<EOS>
"
The

"
Ah

If
Mr

<EOS>
"
Yes

<EOS>
And
if
any

calls

and
says
he

come
about
a

tell
him
to
be
here
at
five
o'clock
this
afternoon

Mrs
Stubbs

"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well

<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
brushed
his
hat
,
whisked
the
crumbs
off
his
inexpressibles
with
a
silk
handkerchief
,
gave
the
ends
of
his
hair
<EOS>
a
persuasive
roll
round
his
forefinger
,
and
sallied
forth
for
Mrs
Taunton
's
domicile
in
Great
Marlborough
-
street
,
where
she
and
her
daughters
occupied
the
upper
part
of
a
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
good
-
looking
widow
of
fifty
,
with
the
form
of
a
giantess
and
the
mind
of
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
The
pursuit
of
pleasure
,
and
some
means
of
killing
time
,
were
the
sole
end
of
her
existence
.
 
<EOS>
She
doted
on
her
daughters
,
who
were
as
frivolous
as
herself
.
   
<EOS>
A
general
exclamation
of
satisfaction
hailed
the
arrival
of
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
who
went
through
the
ordinary
salutations
,
and
threw
himself
into
an
easy
chair
near
the
ladies

work

table
,
with
the
ease
of
a
regularly
established
friend
of
the
family

<EOS>
Mrs
Taunton
was
busily
engaged
in
planting
immense
bright
bows
on
every
part
of
a
smart
cap
on
which
it
was
possible
to
stick
one
;
Miss
Emily
Taunton
was
making
a
watch

guard
;
Miss
Sophia
was
at
the
piano
,
practising
a
new
song

poetry
by
the
young
officer

or
the
police

officer

or
the
custom

house
officer
,
or
some
other
interesting
amateur
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
good

<EOS>
"
said
Mrs

,
addressing
the
gallant
Percy

<EOS>
"
You

You

<EOS>
"
I

I

Mr

triumphantly
.
<EOS>
"
Now

come
here

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Miss

and
Miss
Sophia
advanced
to
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
continued
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
"
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
way
will
be
,
to
have
a
committee
of
ten
,
to
make
all
the
arrangements
,
and
manage
the
whole
set

out

<EOS>
Then
,
I
propose
that
the
expenses
shall
be
paid
by
these
ten
fellows
jointly

"
   
<EOS>
"
Excellent
,
indeed
!
"
said
Mrs
Taunton
,
who
highly
approved
of
this
part
of
the
arrangements
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
plan
is
,
that
each
of
these
ten
fellows
shall
have
the
power
of
asking
five
people
.
 
<EOS>
There
must
be
a
meeting
of
the
committee
,
at
my
chambers
,
to
make
all
the
arrangements
,
and
these
people
shall
be
then
named
;
every
member
of
the
committee
shall
have
the
power
of
black
-
balling
any
one
who
is
proposed
;
and
one
black
ball
shall
exclude
that
person
.
 
<EOS>
This
will
ensure
our
having
a
pleasant
party
,
you
know

"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
manager
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Mrs
Taunton
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charming

<EOS>
"
said
the
lovely
Emily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never

<EOS>
ejaculated
Sophia

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

I
think
it
'll
do

replied
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
who
was
now
quite
in
his
element
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
'll
do

<EOS>
Then
you
know
we
shall
go
down
to
the
Nore

and
back
,
and
have
a
regular
capital
cold
dinner
laid
out
in
the
cabin
before
we
start
,
so
that
everything
may
be
ready
without
any
confusion

we
shall
have
the
lunch
laid
out
,
on
deck
,
in
those
little
tea

garden

looking
concerns
by
the
paddle

I

,
we
shall
hire
a
steamer
expressly
for
our
party
,
and
a
band
,
and
have
the
deck
chalked
,
and
we
shall
be
able
to
dance
quadrilles
all
day
;
and
then
,
whoever
we
know
that
's
musical
,
you
know
,
why
they
'll
make
themselves
useful
and
agreeable
;
and
---
and
<EOS>
---
upon
the
whole
,
I
really
hope
we
shall
have
a
glorious
day
,
you
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
announcement
of
these
arrangements
was
received
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Taunton
,
Emily
,
and
Sophia
,
were
loud
in
their
praises
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
tell
me
,
Percy
,
"
said
Mrs
Taunton
,
"
who
are
the
ten
gentlemen
to
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
plenty
of
fellows
who
'll
be
delighted
with
the
scheme
,
"
replied
Mr
Percy
Noakes
;
"
of
course
we
shall
have
---
"
   
"
Mr
Hardy
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
the
servant
,
announcing
a
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Sophia
and
Miss
Emily
hastily
assumed
the
most
interesting
attitudes
that
could
be
adopted
on
so
short
a
notice
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
"
said
a
stout
gentleman
of
about
forty
,
pausing
at
the
door
in
the
attitude
of
an
awkward
harlequin
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
Mr
Hardy
,
whom
we
have
before
described
,
on
the
authority
of
Mrs
Stubbs
,
as
"
the
funny
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
Astley
-
Cooperish
Joe
Miller
---
a
practical
joker
,
immensely
popular
with
married
ladies
,
and
a
general
favourite
with
young
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
engaged
in
some
pleasure
excursion
or
other
,
and
delighted
in
getting
somebody
into
a
scrape
on
such
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
sing
comic
songs
,
imitate
hackney
-
coachmen
and
fowls
,
play
airs
on
his
chin
,
and
execute
concertos
on
the
Jews'-harp
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
eat
and
drank
most
immoderately
,
and
was
the
bosom
friend
of
Mr
Percy
Noakes
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
red
face
,
a
somewhat
husky
voice
,
and
a
tremendous
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
ARE
you
?
"
said
this
worthy
,
laughing
,
as
if
it
were
the
finest
joke
in
the
world
to
make
a
morning
call
,
and
shaking
hands
with
the
ladies
with
as
much
vehemence
as
if
their
arms
had
been
so
many
pump
-
handles
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
just
the
very
man
I
wanted
,
"
said
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
who
proceeded
to
explain
the
cause
of
his
being
in
requisition
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
Hardy
,
after
hearing
the
statement
,
and
receiving
a
detailed
account
of
the
proposed
excursion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
capital
!
<EOS>
glorious
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
day
it
will
be
!
<EOS>
what
fun
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
,
I
say
,
when
are
you
going
to
begin
making
the
arrangements
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
time
like
the
present
---
at
once
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
charming
!
"
cried
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
Writing
materials
were
laid
before
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
and
the
names
of
the
different
members
of
the
committee
were
agreed
on
,
after
as
much
discussion
between
him
and
Mr
Hardy
as
if
the
fate
of
nations
had
depended
on
their
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
agreed
that
a
meeting
should
take
place
at
Mr
Percy
Noakes
's
chambers
on
the
ensuing
Wednesday
evening
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
the
visitors
departed
.
   
<EOS>
Wednesday
evening
arrived
;
eight
o'clock
came
,
and
eight
members
of
the
committee
were
punctual
in
their
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Loggins
,
the
solicitor
,
of
Boswell
-
court
,
sent
an
excuse
,
and
Mr
Samuel
Briggs
,
the
ditto
of
Furnival
's
Inn
,
sent
his
brother
:
 
much
to
his
(
the
brother
's
)
satisfaction
,
and
greatly
to
the
discomfiture
of
Mr
Percy
Noakes
.
 
<EOS>
Between
the
Briggses
and
the
Tauntons
there
existed
a
degree
of
implacable
hatred
,
quite
unprecedented
.
 
<EOS>
The
animosity
between
the
Montagues
and
Capulets
,
was
nothing
to
that
which
prevailed
between
these
two
illustrious
houses
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Briggs
was
a
widow
,
with
three
daughters
and
two
sons
;
Mr
Samuel
,
the
eldest
,
was
an
attorney
,
and
Mr
Alexander
,
the
youngest
,
was
under
articles
to
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
They
resided
in
Portland
-
street
,
Oxford
-
street
,
and
moved
in
the
same
orbit
as
the
Tauntons
---
hence
their
mutual
dislike
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
Miss
Briggses
appeared
in
smart
bonnets
,
the
Miss
Tauntons
eclipsed
them
with
smarter
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mrs
Taunton
appeared
in
a
cap
of
all
the
hues
of
the
rainbow
,
Mrs
Briggs
forthwith
mounted
a
toque
,
with
all
the
patterns
of
the
kaleidoscope
.
 
<EOS>
If
Miss
Sophia
Taunton
learnt
a
new
song
,
two
of
the
Miss
Briggses
came
out
with
a
new
duet
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tauntons
had
once
gained
a
temporary
triumph
with
the
assistance
of
a
harp
,
but
the
Briggses
brought
three
guitars
into
the
field
,
and
effectually
routed
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
end
to
the
rivalry
between
them
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
as
Mr
Samuel
Briggs
was
a
mere
machine
,
a
sort
of
self
-
acting
legal
walking
-
stick
;
and
as
the
party
was
known
to
have
originated
,
however
remotely
,
with
Mrs
Taunton
,
the
female
branches
of
the
Briggs
family
had
arranged
that
Mr
Alexander
should
attend
,
instead
of
his
brother
;
and
as
the
said
Mr
Alexander
was
deservedly
celebrated
for
possessing
all
the
pertinacity
of
a
bankruptcy
-
court
attorney
,
combined
with
the
obstinacy
of
that
useful
animal
which
browses
on
the
thistle
,
he
required
but
little
tuition
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
especially
enjoined
to
make
himself
as
disagreeable
as
possible
;
and
,
above
all
,
to
black
-
ball
the
Tauntons
at
every
hazard
.
   
<EOS>
The
proceedings
of
the
evening
were
opened
by
Mr
Percy
Noakes
.
<EOS>
After
successfully
urging
on
the
gentlemen
present
the
propriety
of
their
mixing
some
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
he
briefly
stated
the
object
of
the
meeting
,
and
concluded
by
observing
that
the
first
step
must
be
the
selection
of
a
chairman
,
necessarily
possessing
some
arbitrary
---
he
trusted
not
unconstitutional
---
powers
,
to
whom
the
personal
direction
of
the
whole
of
the
arrangements
(
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
committee
)
should
be
confided
.
 
<EOS>
A
pale
young
gentleman
,
in
a
green
stock
and
spectacles
of
the
same
,
a
member
of
the
honourable
society
of
the
Inner
Temple
,
immediately
rose
for
the
purpose
of
proposing
Mr
Percy
Noakes
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
known
him
long
,
and
this
he
would
say
,
that
a
more
honourable
,
a
more
excellent
,
or
a
better
-
hearted
fellow
,
never
existed
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
(
Hear
,
hear
!
)
 
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
who
was
a
member
of
a
debating
society
,
took
this
opportunity
of
entering
into
an
examination
of
the
state
of
the
English
law
,
from
the
days
of
William
the
Conqueror
down
to
the
present
period
;
he
briefly
adverted
to
the
code
established
by
the
ancient
Druids
;
slightly
glanced
at
the
principles
laid
down
by
the
Athenian
law
-
givers
;
and
concluded
with
a
most
glowing
eulogium
on
pic
-
nics
and
constitutional
rights
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Alexander
Briggs
opposed
the
motion
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
highest
esteem
for
Mr
Percy
Noakes
as
an
individual
,
but
he
did
consider
that
he
ought
not
to
be
intrusted
with
these
immense
powers
---
(
oh
,
oh
!
)
---
<EOS>
He
believed
that
in
the
proposed
capacity
Mr
Percy
Noakes
would
not
act
fairly
,
impartially
,
or
honourably
;
but
he
begged
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
,
that
he
said
this
,
without
the
slightest
personal
disrespect
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hardy
defended
his
honourable
friend
,
in
a
voice
rendered
partially
unintelligible
by
emotion
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
proposition
was
put
to
the
vote
,
and
there
appearing
to
be
only
one
dissentient
voice
,
Mr
Percy
Noakes
was
declared
duly
elected
,
and
took
the
chair
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
The
business
of
the
meeting
now
proceeded
with
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
The
chairman
delivered
in
his
estimate
of
the
probable
expense
of
the
excursion
,
and
every
one
present
subscribed
his
portion
thereof
.
<EOS>
The
question
was
put
that
"
The
Endeavour
"
be
hired
for
the
occasion
;
Mr
Alexander
Briggs
moved
as
an
amendment
,
that
the
word
"
Fly
"
be
substituted
for
the
word
"
Endeavour
'
;
but
after
some
debate
consented
to
withdraw
his
opposition
.
 
<EOS>
The
important
ceremony
of
balloting
then
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
A
tea
-
caddy
was
placed
on
a
table
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
apartment
,
and
every
one
was
provided
with
two
backgammon
men
,
one
black
and
one
white
.
   
<EOS>
The
chairman
with
great
solemnity
then
read
the
following
list
of
the
guests
whom
he
proposed
to
introduce
:
---
Mrs
Taunton
and
two
daughters
,
Mr
Wizzle
,
Mr
Simson
.
 
<EOS>
The
names
were
respectively
balloted
for
,
and
Mrs
Taunton
and
her
daughters
were
declared
to
be
black
-
balled
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
and
Mr
Hardy
exchanged
glances
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
your
list
prepared
,
Mr
Briggs
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
chairman
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Alexander
,
delivering
in
the
following
:
---
"
Mrs
Briggs
and
three
daughters
,
Mr
Samuel
Briggs
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
previous
ceremony
was
repeated
,
and
Mrs
Briggs
and
three
daughters
were
declared
to
be
black
-
balled
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Alexander
Briggs
looked
rather
foolish
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
company
appeared
somewhat
overawed
by
the
mysterious
nature
of
the
proceedings
.
   
<EOS>
The
balloting
proceeded
;
but
,
one
little
circumstance
which
Mr
Percy
Noakes
had
not
originally
foreseen
,
prevented
the
system
from
working
quite
as
well
as
he
had
anticipated
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
was
black
-
balled
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Alexander
Briggs
,
by
way
of
retaliation
,
exercised
his
power
of
exclusion
in
every
instance
,
and
the
result
was
,
that
after
three
hours
had
been
consumed
in
hard
balloting
,
the
names
of
only
three
gentlemen
were
found
to
have
been
agreed
to
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
what
was
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
either
the
whole
plan
must
fall
to
the
ground
,
or
a
compromise
must
be
effected
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
alternative
was
preferable
;
and
Mr
Percy
Noakes
therefore
proposed
that
the
form
of
balloting
should
be
dispensed
with
,
and
that
every
gentleman
should
merely
be
required
to
state
whom
he
intended
to
bring
.
 
<EOS>
The
proposal
was
acceded
to
;
the
Tauntons
and
the
Briggses
were
reinstated
;
and
the
party
was
formed
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
Wednesday
was
fixed
for
the
eventful
day
,
and
it
was
unanimously
resolved
that
every
member
of
the
committee
should
wear
a
piece
of
blue
sarsenet
ribbon
round
his
left
arm
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
from
the
statement
of
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
that
the
boat
belonged
to
the
General
Steam
Navigation
Company
,
and
was
then
lying
off
the
Custom
-
house
;
and
,
as
he
proposed
that
the
dinner
and
wines
should
be
provided
by
an
eminent
city
purveyor
,
it
was
arranged
that
Mr
Percy
Noakes
should
be
on
board
by
seven
o'clock
to
superintend
the
arrangements
,
and
that
the
remaining
members
of
the
committee
,
together
with
the
company
generally
,
should
be
expected
to
join
her
by
nine
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
More
brandy
-
and
-
water
was
despatched
;
several
speeches
were
made
by
the
different
law
students
present
;
thanks
were
voted
to
the
chairman
;
and
the
meeting
separated
.
   
<EOS>
The
weather
had
been
beautiful
up
to
this
period
,
and
beautiful
it
continued
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Sunday
passed
over
,
and
Mr
Percy
Noakes
became
unusually
fidgety
---
rushing
,
constantly
,
to
and
from
the
Steam
Packet
Wharf
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
clerks
,
and
the
great
emolument
of
the
Holborn
cabmen
.
 
<EOS>
Tuesday
arrived
,
and
the
anxiety
of
Mr
Percy
Noakes
knew
no
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
every
instant
running
to
the
window
,
to
look
out
for
clouds
;
and
Mr
Hardy
astonished
the
whole
square
by
practising
a
new
comic
song
for
the
occasion
,
in
the
chairman
's
chambers
.
   
<EOS>
Uneasy
were
the
slumbers
of
Mr
Percy
Noakes
that
night
;
he
tossed
and
tumbled
about
,
and
had
confused
dreams
of
steamers
starting
off
,
and
gigantic
clocks
with
the
hands
pointing
to
a
quarter
-
past
nine
,
and
the
ugly
face
of
Mr
Alexander
Briggs
looking
over
the
boat
's
side
,
and
grinning
,
as
if
in
derision
of
his
fruitless
attempts
to
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
violent
effort
to
get
on
board
,
and
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
The
bright
sun
was
shining
cheerfully
into
the
bedroom
,
and
Mr
Percy
Noakes
started
up
for
his
watch
,
in
the
dreadful
expectation
of
finding
his
worst
dreams
realised
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
just
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
He
calculated
the
time
<EOS>
---
he
should
be
a
good
half
-
hour
dressing
himself
;
and
as
it
was
a
lovely
morning
,
and
the
tide
would
be
then
running
down
,
he
would
walk
leisurely
to
Strand
-
lane
,
and
have
a
boat
to
the
Custom
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
He
dressed
himself
,
took
a
hasty
apology
for
a
breakfast
,
and
sallied
forth
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
looked
as
lonely
and
deserted
as
if
they
had
been
crowded
,
overnight
,
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
an
early
apprentice
,
with
quenched
-
looking
sleepy
eyes
,
was
taking
down
the
shutters
of
a
shop
;
and
a
policeman
or
milkwoman
might
occasionally
be
seen
pacing
slowly
along
;
but
the
servants
had
not
yet
begun
to
clean
the
doors
,
or
light
the
kitchen
fires
,
and
London
looked
the
picture
of
desolation
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
corner
of
a
by
-
street
,
near
Temple
-
bar
,
was
stationed
a
"
street
-
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
The
coffee
was
boiling
over
a
charcoal
fire
,
and
large
slices
of
bread
and
butter
were
piled
one
upon
the
other
,
like
deals
in
a
timber
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
The
company
were
seated
on
a
form
,
which
,
with
a
view
both
to
security
and
comfort
,
was
placed
against
a
neighbouring
wall

Two
young
men
,
whose
uproarious
mirth
and
disordered
dress
bespoke
the
conviviality
of
the
preceding
evening
,
were
treating
three
"
ladies
"
and
an
Irish
labourer
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
sweep
was
standing
at
a
short
distance
,
casting
a
longing
eye
at
the
tempting
delicacies
;
and
a
policeman
was
watching
the
group
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
wan
looks
and
gaudy
finery
of
the
thinly
-
clad
women
contrasted
as
strangely
with
the
gay
sunlight
,
as
did
their
forced
merriment
with
the
boisterous
hilarity
of
the
two
young
men
,
who
,
now
and
then
,
varied
their
amusements
by
"
bonneting
"
the
proprietor
of
this
itinerant
coffee
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
walked
briskly
by
,
and
when
he
turned
down
Strand
-
lane
,
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
glistening
water
,
he
thought
he
had
never
felt
so
important
or
so
happy
in
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
Boat
,
sir
?
"
cried
one
of
the
three
watermen
who
were
mopping
out
their
boats
,
and
all
whistling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Boat
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
rather
sharply
;
for
the
inquiry
was
not
made
in
a
manner
at
all
suitable
to
his
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
prefer
a
wessel
,
sir
?
"
inquired
another
,
to
the
infinite
delight
of
the
"
Jack
-
in
-
the
-
water
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
replied
with
a
look
of
supreme
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
want
to
be
put
on
board
a
steamer
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
an
old
fireman
-
waterman
,
very
confidentially
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
faded
red
suit
,
just
the
colour
of
the
cover
of
a
very
old
Court
-
guide
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
make
haste
---
the
Endeavour
---
off
the
Custom
-
house
.
"
   
"
Endeavour
!
"
cried
the
man
who
had
convulsed
the
"
Jack
"
before
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vy
,
I
see
the
Endeavour
go
up
half
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
did
I
,
"
said
another
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
should
think
she
'd
gone
down
by
this
time
,
for
she
's
a
precious
sight
too
full
of
ladies
and
gen'lemen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
affected
to
disregard
these
representations
,
and
stepped
into
the
boat
,
which
the
old
man
,
by
dint
of
scrambling
,
and
shoving
,
and
grating
,
had
brought
up
to
the
causeway
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shove
her
off
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
and
away
the
boat
glided
down
the
river
;
Mr
Percy
Noakes
seated
on
the
recently
mopped
seat
,
and
the
watermen
at
the
stairs
offering
to
bet
him
any
reasonable
sum
that
he
'd
never
reach
the
"
Custum
-
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
she
is
,
by
Jove
!
"
said
the
delighted
Percy
,
as
they
ran
alongside
the
Endeavour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
hard
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
steward
over
the
side
,
and
Mr
Percy
Noakes
jumped
on
board
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hope
you
will
find
everything
as
you
wished
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
She
looks
uncommon
well
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
does
,
indeed
,
"
replied
the
manager
,
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
which
it
is
impossible
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
The
deck
was
scrubbed
,
and
the
seats
were
scrubbed
,
and
there
was
a
bench
for
the
band
,
and
a
place
for
dancing
,
and
a
pile
of
camp
-
stools
,
and
an
awning
;
and
then
Mr
Percy
Noakes
bustled
down
below
,
and
there
were
the
pastrycook
's
men
,
and
the
steward
's
wife
,
laying
out
the
dinner
on
two
tables
the
whole
length
of
the
cabin
;
and
then
Mr
Percy
Noakes
took
off
his
coat
and
rushed
backwards
and
forwards
,
doing
nothing
,
but
quite
convinced
he
was
assisting
everybody
;
and
the
steward
's
wife
laughed
till
she
cried
,
and
Mr
Percy
Noakes
panted
with
the
violence
of
his
exertions
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
the
bell
at
London
-
bridge
wharf
rang
;
and
a
Margate
boat
was
just
starting
;
and
a
Gravesend
boat
was
just
starting
,
and
people
shouted
,
and
porters
ran
down
the
steps
with
luggage
that
would
crush
any
men
but
porters
;
and
sloping
boards
,
with
bits
of
wood
nailed
on
them
,
were
placed
between
the
outside
boat
and
the
inside
boat
;
and
the
passengers
ran
along
them
,
and
looked
like
so
many
fowls
coming
out
of
an
area
;
and
then
,
the
bell
ceased
,
and
the
boards
were
taken
away
,
and
the
boats
started
,
and
the
whole
scene
was
one
of
the
most
delightful
bustle
and
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
wore
on
<EOS>
;
half
-
past
eight
o'clock
arrived
;
the
pastry
-
cook
's
men
went
ashore
;
the
dinner
was
completely
laid
out
;
and
Mr
Percy
Noakes
locked
the
principal
cabin
,
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
,
in
order
that
it
might
be
suddenly
disclosed
,
in
all
its
magnificence
,
to
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
company
.
 
<EOS>
The
band
came
on
board
,
and
so
did
the
wine
.
   
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
to
nine
,
and
the
committee
embarked
in
a
body
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Mr
Hardy
,
in
a
blue
jacket
and
waistcoat
,
white
trousers
,
silk
stockings
,
and
pumps
---
in
full
aquatic
costume
,
with
a
straw
hat
on
his
head
,
and
an
immense
telescope
under
his
arm
;
and
there
was
the
young
gentleman
with
the
green
spectacles
,
in
nankeen
inexplicables
,
with
a
ditto
waistcoat
and
bright
buttons
,
like
the
pictures
of
Paul
---
not
the
saint
,
but
he
of
Virginia
notoriety
.
<EOS>
The
remainder
of
the
committee
,
dressed
in
white
hats
,
light
jackets
,
waistcoats
,
and
trousers
,
looked
something
between
waiters
and
West
India
planters
.
   
<EOS>
Nine
o'clock
struck
,
and
the
company
arrived
in
shoals
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Samuel
Briggs
,
Mrs
Briggs
,
and
the
Misses
Briggs
,
made
their
appearance
in
a
smart
private
wherry
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
guitars
,
in
their
respective
dark
green
cases
,
were
carefully
stowed
away
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
accompanied
by
two
immense
portfolios
of
music
,
which
it
would
take
at
least
a
week
's
incessant
playing
to
get
through
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tauntons
arrived
at
the
same
moment
with
more
music
,
and
a
lion
---
a
gentleman
with
a
bass
voice
and
an
incipient
red
moustache
.
 
<EOS>
The
colours
of
the
Taunton
party
were
pink
;
those
of
the
Briggses
a
light
blue
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tauntons
had
artificial
flowers
in
their
bonnets
;
here
the
Briggses
gained
a
decided
advantage
---
they
wore
feathers
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
,
dear
?
"
said
the
Misses
Briggs
to
the
Misses
Taunton
.
<EOS>
(
The
word
"
dear
"
among
girls
is
frequently
synonymous
with
"
wretch
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
well
,
thank
you
,
dear
,
"
replied
the
Misses
Taunton
to
the
Misses
Briggs
;
and
then
,
there
was
such
a
kissing
,
and
congratulating
,
and
shaking
of
hands
,
as
might
have
induced
one
to
suppose
that
the
two
families
were
the
best
friends
in
the
world
,
instead
of
each
wishing
the
other
overboard
,
as
they
most
sincerely
did
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
received
the
visitors
,
and
bowed
to
the
strange
gentleman
,
as
if
he
should
like
to
know
who
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
just
what
Mrs
Taunton
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
an
opportunity
to
astonish
the
Briggses
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
the
general
of
the
Taunton
party
,
with
a
careless
air
.
<EOS>
---
"
Captain
Helves
---
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
---
Mrs
Briggs
---
Captain
Helves
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
bowed
very
low
;
the
gallant
captain
did
the
same
with
all
due
ferocity
,
and
the
Briggses
were
clearly
overcome
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
,
Mr
Wizzle
,
being
unfortunately
prevented
from
coming
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Taunton
,
"
I
did
myself
the
pleasure
of
bringing
the
captain
,
<EOS>
whose
musical
talents
I
knew
would
be
a
great
acquisition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
the
committee
I
have
to
thank
you
for
doing
so
,
and
to
offer
you
welcome
,
sir
,
"
replied
Percy
.
 
<EOS>
(
Here
the
scraping
was
renewed
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
But
pray
be
seated
---
wo
n't
you
walk
aft
?
 
<EOS>
Captain
,
will
you
conduct
Miss
Taunton
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Miss
Briggs
,
will
you
allow
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
could
they
have
picked
up
that
military
man
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs
Briggs
of
Miss
Kate
Briggs
,
as
they
followed
the
little
party
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
imagine
,
"
replied
Miss
Kate
,
bursting
with
vexation
;
for
the
very
fierce
air
with
which
the
gallant
captain
regarded
the
company
,
had
impressed
her
with
a
high
sense
of
his
importance
.
   
<EOS>
Boat
after
boat
came
alongside
,
and
guest
after
guest
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
The
invites
had
been
excellently
arranged
:
 
<EOS>
Mr
Percy
Noakes
having
considered
it
as
important
that
the
number
of
young
men
should
exactly
tally
with
that
of
the
young
ladies
,
as
that
the
quantity
of
knives
on
board
should
be
in
precise
proportion
to
the
forks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
is
every
one
on
board
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Percy
Noakes
.
 
<EOS>
The
committee
(
who
,
with
their
bits
of
blue
ribbon
,
looked
as
if
they
were
all
going
to
be
bled
)
<EOS>
bustled
about
to
ascertain
the
fact
,
and
reported
that
they
might
safely
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
master
of
the
boat
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
paddle
-
boxes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
!
"
echoed
the
boy
,
who
was
stationed
over
the
hatchway
to
pass
the
directions
down
to
the
engineer
;
and
away
went
the
vessel
with
that
agreeable
noise
which
is
peculiar
to
steamers
,
and
which
is
composed
of
a
mixture
of
creaking
,
gushing
,
clanging
,
and
snorting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hoi
-
oi
-
oi
-
oi
-
oi
-
oi
-
o
-
i
-
i
-
i

"
shouted
half
-
a
-
dozen
voices
from
a
boat
,
a
quarter
of
a
mile
astern
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ease
her
!
"
cried
the
captain
:
 
"
do
these
people
belong
to
us
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Noakes
,
"
exclaimed
Hardy
,
who
had
been
looking
at
every
object
far
and
near
,
through
the
large
telescope
,
"
it
's
the
Fleetwoods
and
the
Wakefields
---
and
two
children
with
them
,
by
Jove
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
shame
to
bring
children
!
"
said
everybody
;
"
how
very
inconsiderate
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
it
would
be
a
good
joke
to
pretend
not
to
see
'em
,
would
n't
it
?
"
suggested
Hardy
,
to
the
immense
delight
of
the
company
generally
.
 
<EOS>
A
council
of
war
was
hastily
held
,
and
it
was
resolved
that
the
newcomers
should
be
taken
on
board
,
on
Mr
Hardy
solemnly
pledging
himself
to
tease
the
children
during
the
whole
of
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
her
!
"
cried
the
captain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
her
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
boy
<EOS>
;
whizz
went
the
steam
,
and
all
the
young
ladies
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
screamed
in
concert
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
only
appeased
by
the
assurance
of
the
martial
Helves
,
that
the
escape
of
steam
consequent
on
stopping
a
vessel
was
seldom
attended
with
any
great
loss
of
human
life
.
   
<EOS>
Two
men
ran
to
the
side
;
and
after
some
shouting
,
and
swearing
,
and
angling
for
the
wherry
with
a
boat
-
hook
,
Mr
Fleetwood
,
and
Mrs
Fleetwood
,
and
Master
Fleetwood
,
and
Mr
Wakefield
,
and
Mrs
Wakefield
,
and
Miss
Wakefield
,
were
safely
deposited
on
the
deck
.
<EOS>
The
girl
was
about
six
years
old
,
the
boy
about
four
;
the
former
was
dressed
in
a
white
frock
with
a
pink
sash
and
dog's
-
eared
-
looking
little
spencer
:
 
a
straw
bonnet
and
green
veil
,
six
inches
by
three
and
a
half
;
the
latter
,
was
attired
for
the
occasion
in
a
nankeen
frock
,
between
the
bottom
of
which
,
and
the
top
of
his
plaid
socks
,
a
considerable
portion
of
two
small
mottled
legs
was
discernible
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
light
blue
cap
with
a
gold
band
and
tassel
on
his
head
,
and
a
damp
piece
of
gingerbread
in
his
hand
,
with
which
he
had
slightly
embossed
his
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
The
boat
once
more
started
off
;
the
band
played
"
Off
<EOS>
she
goes
:
"
the
major
part
of
the
company
conversed
cheerfully
in
groups
;
and
the
old
gentlemen
walked
up
and
down
the
deck
in
pairs
,
as
perseveringly
and
gravely
as
if
they
were
doing
a
match
against
time
for
an
immense
stake
.
 
<EOS>
They
ran
briskly
down
the
Pool
;
the
gentlemen
pointed
out
the
Docks
,
the
Thames
Police
-
office
,
and
other
elegant
public
edifices
;
and
the
young
ladies
exhibited
a
proper
display
of
horror
at
the
appearance
of
the
coal
-
whippers
and
ballast
-
heavers
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hardy
told
stories
to
the
married
ladies
,
at
which
they
laughed
very
much
in
their
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
and
hit
him
on
the
knuckles
with
their
fans
,
declaring
him
to
be
"
a
naughty
man
---
a
shocking
creature
"
---
and
so
forth
;
and
Captain
Helves
gave
slight
descriptions
of
battles
and
duels
,
with
a
most
bloodthirsty
air
,
which
made
him
the
admiration
of
the
women
,
and
the
envy
of
the
men
.
 
<EOS>
Quadrilling
commenced
;
Captain
Helves
danced
one
set
with
Miss
Emily
Taunton
,
and
another
set
with
Miss
Sophia
Taunton
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Taunton
was
in
ecstasies
.
 
<EOS>
The
victory
appeared
to
be
complete
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
the
inconstancy
of
man
!
 
<EOS>
Having
performed
this
necessary
duty
,
he
attached
himself
solely
to
Miss
Julia
Briggs
,
with
whom
he
danced
no
less
than
three
sets
consecutively
,
and
from
whose
side
he
evinced
no
intention
of
stirring
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Hardy
,
having
played
one
or
two
very
brilliant
fantasias
on
the
Jews'-harp
,
and
having
frequently
repeated
the
exquisitely
amusing
joke
of
slily
chalking
a
large
cross
on
the
back
of
some
member
of
the
committee
,
Mr
Percy
Noakes
expressed
his
hope
that
some
of
their
musical
friends
would
oblige
the
company
by
a
display
of
their
abilities
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
he
said
in
a
very
insinuating
manner
,
"
Captain
Helves
will
oblige
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Taunton
's
countenance
lighted
up
,
for
the
captain
only
sang
duets
,
and
could
n't
sing
them
with
anybody
but
one
of
her
daughters
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
said
that
warlike
individual
,
"
I
should
be
very
happy
,
"
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
pray
do
,
"
cried
all
the
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Emily
,
have
you
any
objection
to
join
in
a
duet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
not
the
slightest
,
"
returned
the
young
lady
,
in
a
tone
which
clearly
showed
she
had
the
greatest
possible
objection
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
accompany
you
,
dear
?
"
inquired
one
of
the
Miss
Briggses
,
with
the
bland
intention
of
spoiling
the
effect
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
obliged
to
you
,
Miss
Briggs
,
"
sharply
retorted
Mrs
Taunton
,
who
saw
through
the
manoeuvre
;
"
my
daughters
always
sing
without
accompaniments
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
without
voices
,
"
tittered
Mrs
Briggs
,
in
a
low
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
Mrs
Taunton
,
reddening
,
for
she
guessed
the
tenor
of
the
observation
,
though
she
had
not
heard
it
clearly
---
"
Perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
for
some
people
,
if
their
voices
were
not
quite
so
audible
as
they
are
to
other
people
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
,
perhaps
,
if
gentlemen
who
are
kidnapped
to
pay
attention
to
some
persons
'
daughters
,
had
not
sufficient
discernment
to
pay
attention
to
other
persons
'
daughters
,
"
returned
Mrs
Briggs
,
"
some
persons
would
not
be
so
ready
to
display
that
ill
-
temper
which
,
thank
God
,
distinguishes
them
from
other
persons
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Persons
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs
Taunton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Persons
,
"
replied
Mrs
Briggs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Insolence
!
"
   
"
Creature
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
who
was
one
of
the
very
few
by
whom
this
dialogue
had
been
overheard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
---
pray
,
silence
for
the
duet
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
great
deal
of
preparatory
crowing
and
humming
,
the
captain
began
the
following
duet
from
the
opera
of
"
Paul
and
Virginia
,
"
in
that
grunting
tone
in
which
a
man
gets
down
,
Heaven
knows
where
,
without
the
remotest
chance
of
ever
getting
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
in
private
circles
,
is
frequently
designated
"
a
bass
voice
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
See

sung
the
captain
)

From

the

"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
the
singer
was
interrupted
by
varied
cries
of
the
most
dreadful
description
,
proceeding
from
some
grove
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
starboard
paddle
-
box
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
child
!
"
screamed
Mrs
Fleetwood
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
child
!
<EOS>
it
is
his
voice
---
I
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fleetwood
,
accompanied
by
several
gentlemen
,
here
rushed
to
the
quarter
from
whence
the
noise
proceeded
,
and
an
exclamation
of
horror
burst
from
the
company
;
the
general
impression
being
,
that
the
little
innocent
had
either
got
his
head
in
the
water
,
or
his
legs
in
the
machinery
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
shouted
the
agonised
father
,
as
he
returned
with
the
child
in
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
"
screamed
the
small
sufferer
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
dear
?
"
inquired
the
father
once
more
---
hastily
stripping
off
the
nankeen
frock
,
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
the
child
had
one
bone
which
was
not
smashed
to
pieces
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
---
I
'm
so
frightened
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
at
,
dear
?
---
what
at
?
"
said
the
mother
,
soothing
the
sweet
infant
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
's
been
making
such
dreadful
faces
at
me
,
"
cried
the
boy
,
relapsing
into
convulsions
at
the
bare
recollection
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
!
---
<EOS>
who
?
"
cried
everybody
,
crowding
round
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
---
him
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
child
,
pointing
at
Hardy
,
who
affected
to
be
the
most
concerned
of
the
whole
group
.
   
<EOS>
The
real
state
of
the
case
at
once
flashed
upon
the
minds
of
all
present
,
with
the
exception
of
the
Fleetwoods
and
the
Wakefields
.
<EOS>
The
facetious
Hardy
,
in
fulfilment
of
his
promise
,
had
watched
the
child
to
a
remote
part
of
the
vessel
,
and
,
suddenly
appearing
before
him
with
the
most
awful
contortions
of
visage
,
had
produced
his
paroxysm
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
now
observed
that
it
was
hardly
necessary
for
him
to
deny
the
accusation
;
and
the
unfortunate
little
victim
was
accordingly
led
below
,
after
receiving
sundry
thumps
on
the
head
from
both
his
parents
,
for
having
the
wickedness
to
tell
a
story
.
   
<EOS>
This
little
interruption
having
been
adjusted
,
the
captain
resumed
,
and
Miss
Emily
chimed
in
,
in
due
course
.
 
<EOS>
The
duet
was
loudly
applauded
,
and
,
certainly
,
the
perfect
independence
of
the
parties
deserved
great
commendation
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Emily
sung
her
part
,
without
the
slightest
reference
to
the
captain
;
and
the
captain
sang
so
loud
,
that
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
was
being
done
by
his
partner
.
 
<EOS>
After
having
gone
through
the
last
few
eighteen
or
nineteen
bars
by
himself
,
therefore
,
he
acknowledged
the
plaudits
of
the
circle
with
that
air
of
self
-
denial
which
men
usually
assume
when
they
think
they
have
done
something
to
astonish
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
who
had
just
ascended
from
the
fore
-
cabin
,
where
he
had
been
busily
engaged
in
decanting
the
wine
,
"
if
the
Misses
Briggs
will
oblige
us
with
something
before
dinner
,
I
am
sure
we
shall
be
very
much
delighted
.
"
   
<EOS>
One
of
those
hums
of
admiration
followed
the
suggestion
,
which
one
frequently
hears
in
society
,
when
nobody
has
the
most
distant
notion
what
he
is
expressing
his
approval
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
Misses
Briggs
looked
modestly
at
their
mamma
,
and
the
mamma
looked
approvingly
at
her
daughters
,
and
Mrs
Taunton
looked
scornfully
at
all
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
Misses
Briggs
asked
for
their
guitars
,
and
several
gentlemen
seriously
damaged
the
cases
in
their
anxiety
to
present
them
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
was
a
very
interesting
production
of
three
little
keys
for
the
aforesaid
cases
,
and
a
melodramatic
expression
of
horror
at
finding
a
string
broken
;
and
a
vast
deal
of
screwing
and
tightening
,
and
winding
,
and
tuning
,
during
which
Mrs
Briggs
expatiated
to
those
near
her
on
the
immense
difficulty
of
playing
a
guitar
,
and
hinted
at
the
wondrous
proficiency
of
her
daughters
in
that
mystic
art
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Taunton
whispered
to
a
neighbour
that
it
was
"
quite
sickening
!
"
and
the
Misses
Taunton
looked
as
if
they
knew
how
to
play
,
but
disdained
to
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
Misses
Briggs
began
in
real
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
new
Spanish
composition
,
for
three
voices
and
three
guitars
.
 
<EOS>
The
effect
was
electrical
.
 
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
turned
upon
the
captain
,
who
was
reported
to
have
once
passed
through
Spain
with
his
regiment
,
and
who
must
be
well
acquainted
with
the
national
music
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
raptures
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
sufficient
;
the
trio
was
encored
;
the
applause
was
universal
;
and
never
had
the
Tauntons
suffered
such
a
complete
defeat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
bravo
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
captain
;
---
"
bravo
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
!
is
n't
it
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Samuel
Briggs
,
with
the
air
of
a
self
-
satisfied
showman
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
these
were
the
first
words
he
had
been
heard
to
utter
since
he
left
Boswell
-
court
the
evening
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
De
-
lightful
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
captain
,
with
a
flourish
,
and
a
military
cough
;
---
"
de
-
lightful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sweet
instrument
!
<EOS>
"
said
an
old
gentleman
with
a
bald
head
,
who
had
been
trying
all
the
morning
to
look
through
a
telescope
,
inside
the
glass
of
which
Mr
Hardy
had
fixed
a
large
black
wafer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
hear
a
Portuguese
tambourine
?
"
inquired
that
jocular
individual
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
YOU
ever
hear
a
tom
-
tom
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
sternly
inquired
the
captain
,
who
lost
no
opportunity
of
showing
off
his
travels
,
real
or
pretended
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
what
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Hardy
,
rather
taken
aback
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
tom
-
tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
a
gum
-
gum
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
IS
a
gum
-
gum
?
"
<EOS>
eagerly
inquired
several
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
in
the
East
Indies
,
"
replied
the
captain
---
(
here
was
a
discovery
---
he
had
been
in
the
East
Indies
!
)
<EOS>
---
"
when
I
was
in
the
East
Indies
,
I
was
once
stopping
a
few
thousand
miles
up
the
country
,
on
a
visit
at
the
house
of
a
very
particular
friend
of
mine
,
Ram
Chowdar
Doss
<EOS>
Azuph
Al
Bowlar
---
a
devilish
pleasant
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
were
enjoying
our
hookahs
,
one
evening
,
in
the
cool
verandah
in
front
of
his
villa
,
we
were
rather
surprised
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
thirty
-
four
of
his
Kit
-
ma
-
gars
(
for
he
had
rather
a
large
establishment
there
)
,
accompanied
by
an
equal
number
of
Con
-
su
-
mars
,
approaching
the
house
with
a
threatening
aspect
,
and
beating
a
tom
-
tom
.
 
<EOS>
The
Ram
started
up
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Who
?
"
inquired
the
bald
gentleman
,
intensely
interested
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Ram
---
Ram
Chowdar
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
beg
your
pardon
;
pray
go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
Started
up
and
drew
a
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Helves
,
"
said
he
,
"
my
boy
,
"
<EOS>
---
he
always
called
me
,
my
boy
<EOS>
---
"
Helves
,
"
said
he
,
"
do
you
hear
that
tom
-
tom
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
which
before
was
pale
,
assumed
a
most
frightful
appearance
;
his
whole
visage
was
distorted
,
and
his
frame
shaken
by
violent
emotions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
that
gum
-
gum
?
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
I
,
staring
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
?
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'll
be
damned
if
I
do
,
"
said
I
;
"
and
what
's
more
,
I
do
n't
know
what
a
gum
-
gum
is
,
"
said
<EOS>
I.
 
I
really
thought
the
Ram
would
have
dropped
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
me
aside
,
and
with
an
expression
of
agony
I
shall
never
forget
,
said
in
a
low
whisper
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dinner
's
on
the
table
,
ladies
,
"
interrupted
the
steward
's
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
?
"
said
the
captain
,
immediately
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
,
and
escorting
Miss
Julia
Briggs
to
the
cabin
,
with
as
much
ease
as
if
he
had
finished
the
story
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
an
extraordinary
circumstance
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculated
the
same
old
gentleman
,
preserving
his
listening
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
traveller
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
singular
name
!
"
exclaimed
the
gentlemen
,
rather
confused
by
the
coolness
of
the
whole
affair
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
had
finished
the
story
,
"
said
an
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
a
gum
-
gum
really
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
!
"
exclaimed
Hardy
,
who
until
now
had
been
lost
in
utter
amazement
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
it
may
be
in
India
,
but
in
England
I
think
a
gum
-
gum
has
very
much
the
same
meaning
as
a
hum
-
bug
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
illiberal
!
<EOS>
how
envious
!
"
<EOS>
cried
everybody
,
as
they
made
for
the
cabin
,
fully
impressed
with
a
belief
in
the
captain
's
amazing
adventures
.
 
<EOS>
Helves
was
the
sole
lion
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
---
<EOS>
impudence
and
the
marvellous
are
pretty
sure
passports
to
any
society
.
   
<EOS>
The
party
had
by
this
time
reached
their
destination
,
and
put
about
on
their
return
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
,
which
had
been
with
them
the
whole
day
,
was
now
directly
in
their
teeth
;
the
weather
had
become
gradually
more
and
more
overcast
;
and
the
sky
,
water
,
and
shore
,
were
all
of
that
dull
,
heavy
,
uniform
lead
-
colour
,
which
house
-
painters
daub
in
the
first
instance
over
a
street
-
door
which
is
gradually
approaching
a
state
of
convalescence
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
"
spitting
"
with
rain
for
the
last
half
-
hour
,
and
now
began
to
pour
in
good
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
was
freshening
very
fast
,
and
the
waterman
at
the
wheel
had
unequivocally
expressed
his
opinion
that
there
would
shortly
be
a
squall
.
 
<EOS>
A
slight
emotion
on
the
part
of
the
vessel
,
now
and
then
,
seemed
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
its
pitching
to
a
very
uncomfortable
extent
in
the
event
of
its
blowing
harder
;
and
every
timber
began
to
creak
,
as
if
the
boat
were
an
overladen
clothes
-
basket
.
 
<EOS>
Sea
-
sickness
,
however
,
is
like
a
belief
in
ghosts
---
every
one
entertains
some
misgivings
on
the
subject
,
but
few
will
acknowledge
any
.
 
<EOS>
The
majority
of
the
company
,
therefore
,
endeavoured
to
look
peculiarly
happy
,
feeling
all
the
while
especially
miserable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
it
rain
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
old
gentleman
before
noticed
,
when
,
by
dint
of
squeezing
and
jamming
,
they
were
all
seated
at
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
does
---
a
little
,
"
replied
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
who
could
hardly
hear
himself
speak
,
in
consequence
of
the
pattering
on
the
deck
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
it
blow
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
some
one
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
think
it
does
,
"
responded
Hardy
,
sincerely
wishing
that
he
could
persuade
himself
that
it
did
not
;
for
he
sat
near
the
door
,
and
was
almost
blown
off
his
seat
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
soon
clear
up
,
"
said
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
in
a
cheerful
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
certainly
!
"
ejaculated
the
committee
generally
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
remainder
of
the
company
,
whose
attention
was
now
pretty
well
engrossed
by
the
serious
business
of
eating
,
carving
,
taking
wine
,
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
The
throbbing
motion
of
the
engine
was
but
too
perceptible
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
,
substantial
,
cold
boiled
leg
of
mutton
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
shaking
like
blancmange
;
a
previously
hearty
sirloin
of
beef
looked
as
if
it
had
been
suddenly
seized
with
the
palsy
;
and
some
tongues
,
which
were
placed
on
dishes
rather
too
large
for
them
,
went
through
the
most
surprising
evolutions
;
darting
from
side
to
side
,
and
from
end
to
end
,
like
a
fly
in
an
inverted
wine
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
sweets
shook
and
trembled
,
till
it
was
quite
impossible
to
help
them
,
and
people
gave
up
the
attempt
in
despair
;
and
the
pigeon
-
pies
looked
as
if
the
birds
,
whose
legs
were
stuck
outside
,
were
trying
to
get
them
in
.
 
<EOS>
The
table
vibrated
and
started
like
a
feverish
pulse
,
and
the
very
legs
were
convulsed
---
everything
was
shaking
and
jarring
.
 
<EOS>
The
beams
in
the
roof
of
the
cabin
seemed
as
if
they
were
put
there
for
the
sole
purpose
of
giving
people
head
-
aches
,
and
several
elderly
gentlemen
became
ill
-
tempered
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
As
fast
as
the
steward
put
the
fire
-
irons
up
,
they
WOULD
fall
down
again
;
and
the
more
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
tried
to
sit
comfortably
on
their
seats
,
the
more
the
seats
seemed
to
slide
away
from
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Several
ominous
demands
were
made
for
small
glasses
of
brandy
;
the
countenances
of
the
company
gradually
underwent
most
extraordinary
changes
;
one
gentleman
was
observed
suddenly
to
rush
from
table
without
the
slightest
ostensible
reason
,
and
dart
up
the
steps
with
incredible
swiftness
:
 
thereby
greatly
damaging
both
himself
and
the
steward
,
who
happened
to
be
coming
down
at
the
same
moment
.
   
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
removed
;
the
dessert
was
laid
on
the
table
;
and
the
glasses
were
filled
.
 
<EOS>
The
motion
of
the
boat
increased
;
several
members
of
the
party
began
to
feel
rather
vague
and
misty
,
and
looked
as
if
they
had
only
just
got
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
with
the
spectacles
,
who
had
been
in
a
fluctuating
state
for
some
time
---
at
one
moment
bright
,
and
at
another
dismal
,
like
a
revolving
light
on
the
sea
-
coast
---
rashly
announced
his
wish
to
propose
a
toast
.
<EOS>
After
several
ineffectual
attempts
to
preserve
his
perpendicular
,
the
young
gentleman
,
having
managed
to
hook
himself
to
the
centre
leg
of
the
table
with
his
left
hand
,
proceeded
as
follows
:
   
<EOS>
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
is
among
us
---
I
may
say
a
stranger
---
(
here
some
painful
thought
seemed
to
strike
the
orator
;
he
paused
,
and
looked
extremely
odd
)
---
whose
talents
,
whose
travels
,
whose
cheerfulness
---
"
   
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Edkins
,
"
hastily
interrupted
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
---
<EOS>
"
Hardy
,
what
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
the
"
funny
gentleman
,
"
who
had
just
life
enough
left
to
utter
two
consecutive
syllables
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
have
some
brandy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
replied
Hardy
in
a
tone
of
great
indignation
,
and
looking
as
comfortable
as
Temple
-
bar
in
a
Scotch
mist
;
"
what
should
I
want
brandy
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
on
deck
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
will
NOT
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
said
with
a
most
determined
air
,
and
in
a
voice
which
might
have
been
taken
for
an
imitation
of
anything
;
it
was
quite
as
much
like
a
guinea
-
pig
as
a
bassoon
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Edkins
,
"
said
the
courteous
Percy
;
"
I
thought
our
friend
was
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Edkins
IS
gone
,
"
cried
somebody
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
the
steward
,
running
up
to
Mr
Percy
Noakes
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
but
the
gentleman
as
just
went
on
deck
---
him
with
the
green
spectacles
---
is
uncommon
bad
,
to
be
sure
;
and
the
young
man
as
played
the
wiolin
says
,
that
unless
he
has
some
brandy
he
ca
n't
answer
for
the
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
he
has
a
wife
and
two
children
,
<EOS>
whose
werry
subsistence
depends
on
his
breaking
a
wessel
,
and
he
expects
to
do
so
every
moment
.
 
<EOS>
The
flageolet
's
been
werry
ill
,
but
he
's
better
,
only
he
's
in
a
dreadful
prusperation
.
"
   
<EOS>
All
disguise
was
now
useless
;
the
company
staggered
on
deck
;
the
gentlemen
tried
to
see
nothing
but
the
clouds
;
and
the
ladies
,
muffled
up
in
such
shawls
and
cloaks
as
they
had
brought
with
them
,
lay
about
on
the
seats
,
and
under
the
seats
,
in
the
most
wretched
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Never
was
such
a
blowing
,
and
raining
,
and
pitching
,
and
tossing
,
endured
by
any
pleasure
party
before
.
 
<EOS>
Several
remonstrances
were
sent
down
below
,
on
the
subject
of
Master
Fleetwood
,
but
they
were
totally
unheeded
in
consequence
of
the
indisposition
of
his
natural
protectors
.
 
<EOS>
That
interesting
child
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
until
he
had
no
voice
left
to
scream
with
;
and
then
,
Miss
Wakefield
began
,
and
screamed
for
the
remainder
of
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Hardy
was
observed
,
some
hours
afterwards
,
in
an
attitude
which
induced
his
friends
to
suppose
that
he
was
busily
engaged
in
contemplating
the
beauties
of
the
deep
;
they
only
regretted
that
his
taste
for
the
picturesque
should
lead
him
to
remain
so
long
in
a
position
,
very
injurious
at
all
times
,
but
especially
so
,
to
an
individual
labouring
under
a
tendency
of
blood
to
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
The
party
arrived
off
the
Custom
-
house
at
about
two
o'clock
on
the
Thursday
morning
dispirited
and
worn
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tauntons
were
too
ill
to
quarrel
with
the
Briggses
,
and
the
Briggses
were
too
wretched
to
annoy
the
Tauntons
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
guitar
-
cases
was
lost
on
its
passage
to
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
Mrs
Briggs
has
not
scrupled
to
state
that
the
Tauntons
bribed
a
porter
to
throw
it
down
an
area
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Alexander
Briggs
opposes
vote
by
ballot
---
he
says
from
personal
experience
of
its
inefficacy
;
and
Mr
Samuel
Briggs
,
whenever
he
is
asked
to
express
his
sentiments
on
the
point
,
says
he
has
no
opinion
on
that
or
any
other
subject

Mr
Edkins
---
the
young
gentleman
in
the
green
spectacles
---
makes
a
speech
on
every
occasion
on
which
a
speech
can
possibly
be
made
:
the
eloquence
of
which
can
only
be
equalled
by
its
length
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
event
of
his
not
being
previously
appointed
to
a
judgeship
,
it
is
probable
that
he
will
practise
as
a

in

Captain
Helves
continued
his
attention
to
Miss
Julia
Briggs
,
whom
he
might
possibly
have
espoused
,
if
it
had
not
unfortunately
happened
that
Mr
Samuel
arrested
him
,
in
the
way
of
business
,
pursuant
to
instructions
received
from
Messrs.
 
Scroggins
and
Payne
,
whose
town

debts
the
gallant
captain
had
condescended
to
collect
,
but
whose
accounts
,
with
the
indiscretion
sometimes
peculiar
to
military
minds
,
he
had
omitted
to
keep
with
that
dull
accuracy
which
custom
has
rendered
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Taunton
complains
that
she
has
been
much
deceived
in
him

<EOS>
He
introduced
himself
to
the
family
on
board
a
Gravesend
steam

packet

and
certainly
,
therefore
,
ought
to
have
proved
respectable

Tradition
tells
of
a
"
Little
Winglebury
,
"
down
some
cross
-
road
about
two
miles
off
;
and
,
as
a
square
mass
of
dirty
paper
,
supposed
to
have
been
originally
intended
for
a
letter
,
with
certain
tremulous
characters
inscribed
thereon
,
in
which
a
lively
imagination
might
trace
a
remote
resemblance
to
the
word
"
Little
,
"
was
once
stuck
up
to
be
owned
in
the
sunny
window
of
the
Great
Winglebury
Post
-
office
,
from
which
it
only
disappeared
when
it
fell
to
pieces
with
dust

extreme
old
age
,
there
would
appear
to
be
some
foundation

the
legend

Common
belief

to
bestow

upon
a
little
hole
at
the

of
a
muddy
lane
about
a
couple
of
miles
long
,
colonised
by
one
wheelwright
,
four
paupers
,
and
a
beer
-
shop
;
but
,
even
this
authority
,
slight
as
it
is
,
must
be
regarded
with
extreme
suspicion
,
inasmuch
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
hole
aforesaid
,
concur
in
opining
that
it
never
had
any
name
at
all

from

Four

surrounded
by

boys
in
shiny
hats

engaged
in

creature
was
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
the
loud
notes
of
a
key
-
bugle
broke
the
monotonous
stillness
of
the
street
;
in
came
the
coach
,
rattling
over
the
uneven
paving
with
a
noise
startling
enough
to
stop
even
the
large
-
faced
clock
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Down
got
the
outsides
,
up
went
the
windows
in
all
directions
,
out
came
the
waiters
,
up
started
the
ostlers
,
and
the
loungers
,
and
the
post
-
boys
,
and
the
ragged
boys
,
as
if
they
were
electrified
---
unstrapping
,
and
unchaining
,
and
unbuckling
,
and
dragging
willing
horses
out
,
and
forcing
reluctant
horses
in
,
and
making
a
most
exhilarating
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
"

said
the

.
 
<EOS>
"
Please

interrogated

<EOS>
"

the

<EOS>
"
Nothing

"
inquired
the

.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing

"
replied
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Up
got
the
outsides
again
,
and
the
guard
,
and
the
coachman
;
off
came
the
cloths
,
with
a
jerk
;
"
All
right
,
"
was
the
cry
;
and
away
they
went
.
 
<EOS>
The
loungers
lingered
a
minute
or
two
in
the
road
,
watching
the
coach
until
it
turned
the
corner
,
and
then
loitered
away
one
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
street
was
clear
again
,
and
the
town
,
by
contrast
,
quieter
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"

said
number

turning
from

out
of
which
he
had
been
surveying
the
scene
just
described
.

"
You

<EOS>
The
waiter
pulled
down
the
window
-
blind
,
and
then
pulled
it
up
again
---
for
a
regular
waiter
must
do
something
before
he
leaves
the
room
---
adjusted
the
glasses
on
the
side
-
board
,
brushed
a
place
that
was
NOT
dusty
,
rubbed
his
hands
very
hard
,
walked
stealthily
to
the
door
,
and
evaporated
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
,
evidently
,
something
in
the
contents
of
the
letter
,
of
a
nature
,
if
not
wholly
unexpected
,
certainly
extremely
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Mr
Alexander
Trott
laid
it
down
,
and
took
it
up
again
,
and
walked
about
the
room
on
particular
squares
of
the
carpet
,
and
even
attempted
,
though
unsuccessfully
,
to
whistle
an
air
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
n't
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
read
the
following
epistle
aloud
:

I

ejaculated
the
terrified
Trott
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
told
father
,
that
once
start
me
on
this
expedition
,
and
Hunter
would
pursue
me
like
the
Wandering
Jew
.
<EOS>
It
's
bad
enough
as
it
is
,
to
marry
with
the
old
people
's
commands
,
and
without
the
girl
's
consent
;
but
what
will
Emily
think
of
me
,
if
I
go
down
there
breathless
with
running
away
from
this
infernal
salamander

<EOS>
What

What
CAN

<EOS>
If

go

I
'm
disgraced
for

lose
the

and
,
what
's
more

lose
the
money
too
.
 
<EOS>
Even
if
I
did
go
on
to
the
Browns

by
the
coach
,
Hunter
would
be
after
me
in
a
post

chaise
;
and
if
I
go
to
this
place

this
Stiffun
's
Acre
(
another
shudder
)
,
I
'm
as
good
as

<EOS>
I
've
seen
him
hit
the
man
at

Pall

mall
shooting

gallery
,
in
the
second
button
-
hole
of
the

,
five
times
out

and
when

did

hit

there
,
he
hit
him
in

<EOS>
"
With
this
consolatory
reminiscence
Mr
Alexander
Trott
again
ejaculated
,
"
What
shall
I
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
Long
and
weary
were
his
reflections
,
as
,
burying
his
face
in
his
hand
,
he
sat
,
ruminating
on
the
best
course
to
be
pursued
.
 
<EOS>
His
mental
direction
-
post
pointed
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
"
governor
's
"
anger
,
and
the
loss
of
the
fortune
which
the
paternal
Brown
had
promised
the
paternal
Trott
his
daughter
should
contribute
to
the
coffers
of
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
words
"
To
Brown
's
"
were
legibly
inscribed
on
the
said
direction
-
post
,
but
Horace
Hunter
's
denunciation
rung
in
his
ears
;
<EOS>
---
last
of
all
it
bore
,
in
red
letters
,
the
words
,
"
To
Stiffun
's
Acre
;
"
and
then
Mr
Alexander
Trott
decided
on
adopting
a
plan
which
he
presently
matured
.
   
<EOS>
First
and
foremost
,
he
despatched
the
under
-
boots
to
the
Blue
Lion
and
Stomach
-
warmer
,
with
a
gentlemanly
note
to
Mr
Horace
Hunter
,
intimating
that
he
thirsted
for
his
destruction
and
would
do
himself
the
pleasure
of
slaughtering
him
next
morning
,
without
fail
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
wrote
another
letter
,
and
requested
the
attendance
of
the
other
boots
---
for
they
kept
a
pair
.
 
<EOS>
A
modest
knock
at
the
room
door
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
Mr
Trott
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
thrust
in
a
red
head
with
one
eye
in
it
,
and
being
again
desired
to
"
come
in
,
"
brought
in
the
body
and
the
legs
to
which
the
head
belonged
,
and
a
fur
cap
which
belonged
to
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
upper
-
boots
,
I
think
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Trott
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
am
the
upper
-
boots
,
"
replied
a
voice
from
inside
a
velveteen
case
,
with
mother
-
of
-
pearl
buttons
---
"
that
is
,
I
'm
the
boots
as
b'longs
to
the
house
;
the
other
man
's
my
man

as
goes
errands
and
does
odd
jobs

half

boots

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're

"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Trott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Driv
a
cab
once
<EOS>
,
"
was
the
laconic
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
drive
it
now
?
"
asked
Mr
Trott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Over
-
driv
the
cab
,
and
driv
over
a
'
ooman

"
replied
the
top
-
boots
,
with
brevity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
the
mayor
's
house
?
"
inquired
Mr
Trott
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
,
"
replied
the
boots
,
significantly
,
as
if
he
had
some
good
reason
to
remember
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
you
could
manage
to
leave
a
letter
there
?
"
<EOS>
interrogated
Trott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Should
n't
wonder
,
"
responded
boots
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
this
letter
,
"
said
Trott
,
holding
a
deformed
note
with
a
paralytic
direction
in
one
hand
,
and
five
shillings
in
the
other
---
"
this
letter
is
anonymous
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
---
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
interrupted
the
boots
.
   
<EOS>
"
Anonymous
<EOS>
---
he
's
not
to
know
who
it
comes
from
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
"
responded
the
reg'lar
,
with
a
knowing
wink
,
but
without
evincing
the
slightest
disinclination
to
undertake
the
charge
---
"
I
see
---
<EOS>
bit
o
'
Sving
,
eh
?
"
and
his
one
eye
wandered
round
the
room
,
as
if
in
quest
of
a
dark
lantern
and
phosphorus
-
box
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
he
continued
,
recalling
the
eye
from
its
search
,
and
bringing
it
to
bear
on
Mr
Trott
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
he
's
a
lawyer
,
our
mayor
,
and
insured
in
the
County
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
've
a
spite
agen
him
,
you
'd
better
not
burn
his
house
down
---
blessed
if
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
the
greatest
favour
you
could
do
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
chuckled
inwardly
.
   
<EOS>
If
Mr
Alexander
Trott
had
been
in
any
other
situation
,
his
first
act
would
have
been
to
kick
the
man
down
-
stairs
by
deputy
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
to
ring
the
bell
,
and
desire
the
landlord
to
take
his
boots
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
contented
himself
,
however
,
with
doubling
the
fee
and
explaining
that
the
letter
merely
related
to
a
breach
of
the
peace
.
 
<EOS>
The
top
-
boots
retired
,
solemnly
pledged
to
secrecy
;
and
Mr
Alexander
Trott
sat
down
to
a
fried
sole
,
maintenon
cutlet
,
Madeira
,
and
sundries
,
with
greater
composure
than
he
had
experienced
since
the
receipt
of
Horace
Hunter
's
letter
of
defiance
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
who
alighted
from
the
London
coach
had
no
sooner
been
installed
in
number
twenty
-
five
,
and
made
some
alteration
in
her
travelling
-
dress
,
than
she
indited
a
note
to
Joseph
Overton
,
esquire
,
solicitor
,
and
mayor
of
Great
Winglebury
,
requesting
his
immediate
attendance
on
private
business
of
paramount
importance
---
a
summons
which
that
worthy
functionary
lost
no
time
in
obeying
;
for
after
sundry
openings
of
his
eyes
,
divers
ejaculations
of
"
Bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
other
manifestations
of
surprise
,
he
took
his
broad
-
brimmed
hat
from
its
accustomed
peg
in
his
little
front
office
,
and
walked
briskly
down
the
High
-
street
to
the
Winglebury
Arms
;
through
the
hall
and
up
the
staircase
of
which
establishment
he
was
ushered
by
the
landlady
,
and
a
crowd
of
officious
waiters
,
to
the
door
of
number
twenty
-
five
.
   
<EOS>
"
Show
the
gentleman
in
,
"
said
the
stranger
lady
,
in
reply
to
the
foremost
waiter
's
announcement
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
was
shown
in
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
rose
from
the
sofa
;
the
mayor
advanced
a
step
from
the
door
;
and
there
they
both
paused
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
looking
at
one
another
as
if
by
mutual
consent
.
 
<EOS>
The
mayor
saw
before
him
a
buxom
,
richly
-
dressed
female
of
about
forty
;
the
lady
looked
upon
a
sleek
man
,
about
ten
years
older
,
in
drab
shorts
and
continuations
,
black
coat
,
neckcloth
,
and
gloves
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Julia
Manners
!
"
exclaimed
the
mayor
at
length
,
"
you
astonish
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
unfair
of
you
,
Overton
,
"
replied
Miss
Julia
,
"
for
I
have
known
you
,
long
enough
,
not
to
be
surprised
at
anything
you
do
,
and
you
might
extend
equal
courtesy
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
to
run
away
---
actually
run
away
---
with
a
young
man
!
"
remonstrated
the
mayor
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
have
me
actually
run
away
with
an
old
one
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
cool
rejoinder
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
then
to
ask
me
---
me
---
of
all
people
in
the
world
---
a
man
of
my
age
and
appearance
---
mayor
of
the
town
---
to
promote
such
a
scheme
!
"
<EOS>
pettishly
ejaculated
Joseph
Overton
;
throwing
himself
into
an
arm
-
chair
,
and
producing
Miss
Julia
's
letter
from
his
pocket
,
as
if
to
corroborate
the
assertion
that
he
HAD
been
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Overton
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
"
I
want
your
assistance
in
this
matter
,
and
I
must

it

<EOS>
In
the
lifetime
of
that
poor
old
dear
,
Mr
Cornberry
,
who
---
who
---
"
   
"
Who
was
to
have
married
you
,
and
did
n't
,
because
he
died
first
;
and
who
left
you
his
property
unencumbered
with
the
addition
of
himself
,
"
suggested
the
mayor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
replied
Miss
Julia
,
reddening
slightly
,
"
in
the
lifetime
of
the
poor
old
dear
,
the
property
had
the
incumbrance
of
your
management
;
and
all
I
will
say
of
that
,
is
,
that
I
only
wonder
it
did
n't
die
of
consumption
instead
of
its
master
.
 
<EOS>
You
helped
yourself
then
:
---
help
me
now
.

<EOS>
Mr
Joseph
Overton
was
a
man
of
the
world
,
and
an
attorney
;
and
as
certain
indistinct
recollections
of
an
odd
thousand
pounds
or
two
,
appropriated
by
mistake
,
passed
across
his
mind
he
hemmed
deprecatingly
,
smiled
blandly
,
remained
silent
for
a
few
seconds
;
and
finally
inquired
,
"
What
do
you
wish
me
to
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
replied
Miss
Julia
---
"
I
'll
tell
you
in
three
words
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Lord
Peter
---
"
   
"
That
's
the
young
man
,
I
suppose
---
"
interrupted
the
mayor
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
young
Nobleman
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
with
a
great
stress
on
the
last
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lord
Peter
is
considerably
afraid
of
the
resentment
of
his
family
;
and
we
have
therefore
thought
it
better
to
make
the
match
a
stolen
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
town
,
to
avoid
suspicion
,
on
a
visit
to
his
friend
,
the
Honourable
Augustus
Flair
,
whose
seat
,
as
you
know
,
is
about
thirty
miles
from
this
,
accompanied
only
by
his
favourite
tiger
.
 
<EOS>
We
arranged
that
I
should
come
here
alone
in
the
London
coach
;
and
that
he
,
leaving
his
tiger
and
cab
behind
him
,
should
come
on
,
and
arrive
here
as
soon
as
possible
this
afternoon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
observed
Joseph
Overton
,
"
and
then
he
can
order
the
chaise
,
and
you
can
go
on
to
Gretna
Green
together
,
without
requiring
the
presence
or
interference
of
a
third
party
,
ca
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Miss
Julia
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
every
reason
to
believe
---
<EOS>
dear
Lord
Peter
not
being
considered
very
prudent
or
sagacious
by
his
friends
,
and
they
having
discovered
his
attachment
to
me
---
that
,
immediately
on
his
absence
being
observed
,
pursuit
will
be
made
in
this
direction
:
---
to
elude
which
,
and
to
prevent
our
being
traced
,
I
wish
it
to
be
understood
in
this
house
,
that
dear
Lord
Peter
is
slightly
deranged
,
though
perfectly
harmless
;
and
that
I
am
,
unknown
to
him
,
awaiting
his
arrival
to
convey
him
in
a
post
-
chaise
to
a
private
asylum
---
at
Berwick
,
say
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
show
myself
much
,
I
dare
say
I
can
manage
to
pass
for
his
mother
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
thought
occurred
to
the
mayor
's
mind
that
the
lady
might
show
herself
a
good
deal
without
fear
of
detection
;
seeing
that
she
was
about
double
the
age
of
her
intended
husband
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
,
however
,
and
the
lady
proceeded
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
whole
of
this
arrangement
<EOS>
dear
Lord
Peter
is
acquainted
;
and
all
I
want
you
to
do
,
is
,
to
make
the
delusion
more
complete
by
giving
it
the
sanction
of
your
influence
in
this
place
,
and
assigning
this
as
a
reason
to
the
people
of
the
house
for
my
taking
the
young
gentleman
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
story
that
I
should
see
him
until
after
he
has
entered
the
chaise
,
I
also
wish
you
to
communicate
with
him
,
and
inform
him
that
it
is
all
going
on
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
he
arrived
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Overton
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
how
am
I
to
know
!
"
inquired
the
mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
will
not
give
his
own
name
at
the
bar
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
begged
him
,
immediately
on
his
arrival
,
to
write
you
a
note
,
"
replied
Miss
Manners
;
"
and
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
our
project
being
discovered
through
its
means
,
I
desired
him
to
write
anonymously
,
and
in
mysterious
terms
,
to
acquaint
you
with
the
number
of
his
room
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
mayor
,
rising
from
his
seat
,
and
searching
his
pockets
---
<EOS>
"
most
extraordinary
circumstance
---
he
has
arrived
---
mysterious
note
left
at
my
house
in
a
most
mysterious
manner
,
just
before
yours
---
did
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
before
,
and
certainly
should
n't
have
attended
to
it
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
here
it
is
.
"
<EOS>
And
Joseph
Overton
pulled
out
of
an
inner
coat
-
pocket
the
identical
letter
penned
by
Alexander
Trott
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
his
lordship
's
hand
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
"
replied
Julia
;
"
good
,
punctual
creature
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
it
more
than
once
or
twice
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
he
writes
very
badly
and
very
large
.
 
<EOS>
These
dear
,
wild
young
noblemen
,
you
know
,
Overton
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Ay
,
ay
,
I
see
,
"
replied
the
mayor
.
<EOS>
---
"
Horses
and
dogs
,
play
and
wine
---
grooms
,
actresses
,
and
cigars
---
the
stable
,
the
green
-
room
,
the
saloon
,
and
the
tavern
;
and
the
legislative
assembly
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
what
he
says
,
"
pursued
the
mayor
;
"
"
Sir
,
---
A
young
gentleman
in
number
nineteen
at
the
Winglebury
Arms
,
is
bent
on
committing
a
rash
act
to
-
morrow
morning
at
an
early
hour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
That
's
good
---
he
means
marrying
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
any
regard
for
the
peace
of
this
town
,
or
the
preservation
of
one
---
it
may
be
two
---
human
lives
"
---
What
the
deuce
does
he
mean
by
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
he
's
so
anxious
for
the
ceremony
,
he
will
expire
if
it
's
put
off
,
and
that
I
may
possibly
do
the
same
,
"
replied
the
lady
with
great
complacency
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
---
not
much
fear
of
that
;
---
well
---
"
two
human
lives
<EOS>
,
you
will
cause
him
to
be
removed
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
He
wants
to
start
at
once
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
Fear
not
to
do
this
on
your
responsibility
:
 
for
to
-
morrow
the
absolute
necessity
of
the
proceeding
will
be
but
too
apparent
.
<EOS>
Remember
:
 
number
nineteen
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
is
Trott
.
 
<EOS>
No
delay
;
for
life
and
death
depend
upon
your
promptitude
.
"
 
<EOS>
Passionate
language
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
see
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
,
"
replied
Miss
Julia
;
"
and
entreat
him
to
act
his
part
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
half
afraid
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
to
be
cautious
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
the
mayor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Settle
all
the
arrangements
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
the
mayor
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
say
I
think
the
chaise
had
better
be
ordered
for
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
the
mayor
once
more
;
and
,
ruminating
on
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
in
which
fate
and
old
acquaintance
had
placed
him
,
he
desired
a
waiter
to
herald
his
approach
to
the
temporary
representative
of
number
nineteen
.
   
<EOS>
The
announcement
,
"
Gentleman
to
speak
with
you
,
sir
,
"
induced
Mr
Trott
to
pause
half
-
way
in
the
glass
of
port
,
the
contents
of
which
he
was
in
the
act
of
imbibing
at
the
moment
;
to
rise
from
his
chair
;
and
retreat
a
few
paces
towards
the
window
,
as
if
to
secure
a
retreat
,
in
the
event
of
the
visitor
assuming
the
form
and
appearance
of
Horace
Hunter
.
 
<EOS>
One
glance
at
Joseph
Overton
,
however
,
quieted
his
apprehensions
.
 
<EOS>
He
courteously
motioned
the
stranger
to
a
seat
.
 
<EOS>
The
waiter
,
after
a
little
jingling
with
the
decanter
and
glasses
,
consented
to
leave
the
room
;
and
Joseph
Overton
,
placing
the
broad
-
brimmed
hat
on
the
chair
next
him
,
and
bending
his
body
gently
forward
,
opened
the
business
by
saying
in
a
very
low
and
cautious
tone
,
   
"
My
lord
---
"
   
"
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Alexander
Trott
,
in
a
loud
key
,
with
the
vacant
and
mystified
stare
of
a
chilly
somnambulist
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
---
hush
!
"
said
the
cautious
attorney
:
 
"
to
be
sure
---
quite
right
---
<EOS>
no
titles
here
<EOS>
---
my
name
is
Overton
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Overton
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
 
the
mayor
of
this
place
<EOS>
---
you
sent
me
a
letter
with
anonymous
information
,
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
sir
?
"
exclaimed
Trott
with
ill
-
dissembled
surprise
;
for
,
coward
as
he
was
,
he
would
willingly
have
repudiated
the
authorship
of
the
letter
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
,
sir
;
did
you
not
?
"
responded
Overton
,
annoyed
with
what
he
supposed
to
be
an
extreme
degree
of
unnecessary
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
Either
this
letter
is
yours
,
or
it
is
not
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
,
we
can
converse
securely
upon
the
subject
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
not
,
of
course
I
have
no
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Stay
,
stay
,
"
said
Trott
,
"
it
IS
mine
;
I
DID
write
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
friend
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
the
mayor
,
encouragingly
,
"
you
could
not
have
managed
it
better
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
;
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
leave
here
to
-
night
in
a
post
-
chaise
and
four
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
harder
the
boys
drive
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
safe
from
pursuit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Trott
,
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
,
"
can
such
things
happen
in
a
country
like
this
?
 
<EOS>
Such
unrelenting
and
cold
-
blooded
hostility
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
wiped
off
the
concentrated
essence
of
cowardice
that
was
oozing
fast
down
his
forehead
,
and
looked
aghast
at
Joseph
Overton
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
is
a
very
hard
case
,
"
replied
the
mayor
with
a
smile
,
"
that
,
in
a
free
country
,
people
ca
n't
marry
whom
they
like
,
without
being
hunted
down
as
if
they
were
criminals
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
in
the
present
instance
the
lady
is
willing
,
you
know
,
and
that
's
the
main
point
,
after
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lady
willing
,
"
repeated
Trott
,
mechanically
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
the
lady
's
willing
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
that
's
a
good
one
,
"
said
the
mayor
,
benevolently
tapping
Mr
Trott
on
the
arm
with
his
broad
-
brimmed
hat
;
"
I
have
known
her
,
well
,
for
a
long
time
;
and
if
anybody
could
entertain
the
remotest
doubt
on
the
subject
,
I
assure
you
I
have
none
,
nor
need
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Trott
,
ruminating
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
VERY
extraordinary
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Lord
Peter
,
"
said
the
mayor
,
rising
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
Peter
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Mr
Trott
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
---
ah
,
I
forgot
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Trott
,
then
---
Trott
---
very
good
,
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
the
chaise
shall
be
ready
at
half
-
past
twelve
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
to
become
of
me
until
then
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Trott
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
it
save
appearances
,
if
I
were
placed
under
some
restraint
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Overton
,
"
very
good
thought
---
capital
idea
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
somebody
up
directly
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
make
a
little
resistance
when
we
put
you
in
the
chaise
it
would
n't
be
amiss
---
<EOS>
look
as
if
you
did
n't
want
to
be
taken
away
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Trott
---
"
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Overton
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
<EOS>
until
then
,
I
wish
your
lordship
a
good
evening
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
---
lordship
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Trott
again
,
falling
back
a
step
or
two
,
and
gazing
,
in
unutterable
wonder
,
on
the
countenance
of
the
mayor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
-
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
my
lord
---
practising
the
madman
?
<EOS>
---
very
good
indeed
---
very
vacant
look

capital
,
my
lord
,
capital

<EOS>
good
evening
,
<EOS>
Mr
---
Trott
---
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
mayor
's
decidedly
drunk
,
"
soliloquised
Mr
Trott
,
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
in
an
attitude
of
reflection
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
much
cleverer
fellow
than
I
thought
him
,
that
young
nobleman
---
he
carries
it
off
uncommonly
well
,
"
thought
Overton
,
as
he
went
his
way
to
the
bar
,
there
to
complete
his
arrangements
.
<EOS>
This
was
soon
done
.
 
<EOS>
Every
word
of
the
story
was
implicitly
believed
,
and
the
one
-
eyed
boots
was
immediately
instructed
to
repair
to
number
nineteen
,
to
act
as
custodian
of
the
person
of
the
supposed
lunatic
until
half
-
past
twelve
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
this
direction
,
that
somewhat
eccentric
gentleman
armed
himself
with
a
walking
-
stick
of
gigantic
dimensions
,
and
repaired
,
with
his
usual
equanimity
of
manner
,
to
Mr
Trott
's
apartment
,
which
he
entered
without
any
ceremony
,
and
mounted
guard
in
,
by
quietly
depositing
himself
on
a
chair
near
the
door
,
where
he
proceeded
to
beguile
the
time
by
whistling
a
popular
air
with
great
apparent
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
here
,
you
scoundrel
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Alexander
Trott
,
with
a
proper
appearance
of
indignation
at
his
detention
.
   
<EOS>
The
boots
beat
time
with
his
head
,
as
he
looked
gently
round
at
Mr
Trott
with
a
smile
of
pity
,
and
whistled
an
ADAGIO
movement
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
attend
in
this
room
by
Mr
Overton
's
desire
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Trott
,
rather
astonished
at
the
man
's
demeanour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
yourself
to
yourself
,
young
feller
,
"
calmly
responded
the
boots
,
"
and
do
n't
say
nothing
to
nobody
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
whistled
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
mind
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Trott
,
anxious
to
keep
up
the
farce
of
wishing
with
great
earnestness
to
fight
a
duel
if
they
'd
let
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
protest
against
being
kept
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
deny
that
I
have
any
intention
of
fighting
with
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
it
's
useless
contending
with
superior
numbers
,
I
shall
sit
quietly
down
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
,
"
observed
the
placid
boots
,
shaking
the
large
stick
expressively
.
   
<EOS>
"
Under
protest
,
however
,
"
added
Alexander
Trott
,
seating
himself
with
indignation
in
his
face
,
but
great
content
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Under
protest
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
!
"
responded
the
boots
;
"
anything
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
're
happy
,
I
'm
transported
;
only
do
n't
talk
too
much
---
it
'll
make
you
worse
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Make
me
worse
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Trott
,
in
unfeigned
astonishment
:
 
"
the
man
's
drunk
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
be
quiet
,
young
feller
,
"
remarked
the
boots
,
going
through
a
threatening
piece
of
pantomime
with
the
stick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
mad
!
"
said
Mr
Trott
,
rather
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
room
,
sir
,
and
tell
them
to
send
somebody
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
do
!
"
replied
the
boots
.
   
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
room
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Trott
,
ringing
the
bell
violently
:
 
for
he
began
to
be
alarmed
on
a
new
score
.
   
<EOS>
"
Leave
that
'
ere
bell
alone
,
you
wretched
loo
-
nattic
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
boots
,
suddenly
forcing
the
unfortunate
Trott
back
into
his
chair
,
and
brandishing
the
stick
aloft
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
quiet
,
you
miserable
object
,
and
do
n't
let
everybody
know
there
's
a
madman
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
IS
a
madman
!
 
<EOS>
He
IS
a
madman
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
terrified
Mr
Trott
,
gazing
on
the
one
eye
of
the
red
-
headed
boots
with
a
look
of
abject
horror
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madman
!
"
replied
the
boots
,
"
dam'me
,
I
think
he
IS
a
madman
with
a
vengeance
!
 
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
you
unfortunate
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
would
you
?
"
<EOS>
[
a
slight
tap
on
the
head
with
the
large
stick
,
as
Mr
Trott
made
another
move
towards
the
bell
-
handle
]
<EOS>
"
I
caught
you
there
!
<EOS>
did
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Spare
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Trott
,
raising
his
hands
imploringly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
your
life
,
"
replied
the
boots
,
disdainfully
,
"
though
I
think
it
'
ud
be
a
charity
if
somebody
took
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
it
would
n't
,
"
interrupted
poor
Mr
Trott
,
hurriedly
,
"
no
,
no
,
it
would
n't
!
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
'd
rather
keep
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
werry
<EOS>
well
,
"
said
the
boots
:
 
<EOS>
"
that
's
a
mere
matter
of
taste
---
<EOS>
ev'ry
one
to
his
liking
.
 
<EOS>
Hows'ever
,
all
I
've
got
to
say
is
this
here
:
 
<EOS>
You
sit
quietly
down
in
that
chair
,
and
I
'll
sit
hoppersite
you
here
,
and
if
you
keep
quiet
and
do
n't
stir
,
I
wo
n't
damage
you
;
but
,
if
you
move
hand
or
foot
till
half
-
past
twelve
o'clock
,
I
shall
alter
the
expression
of
your
countenance
so
completely
,
that
the
next
time
you
look
in
the
glass
you
'll
ask
vether
<EOS>
you
're
gone
out
of
town
,
and
ven
<EOS>
you
're
likely
to
come
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
So
sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
---
I
will
,
"
responded
the
victim
of
mistakes
;
and
down
sat
Mr
Trott
and
down
sat
the
boots
too
,
<EOS>
exactly
opposite
him
,
with
the
stick
ready
for
immediate
action
in
case
of
emergency
.
   
<EOS>
Long
and
dreary
were
the
hours
that
followed
.
 
<EOS>
The
bell
of
Great
Winglebury
church
had
just
struck
ten
,
and
two
hours
and
a
half
would
probably
elapse
before
succour
arrived
.
   
<EOS>
For
half
an
hour
,
the
noise
occasioned
by
shutting
up
the
shops
in
the
street
beneath
,
betokened
something
like
life
in
the
town
,
and
rendered
Mr
Trott
's
situation
a
little
less
insupportable
;
but
,
when
even
these
ceased
,
and
nothing
was
heard
beyond
the
occasional
rattling
of
a
post
-
chaise
as
it
drove
up
the
yard
to
change
horses
,
and
then
drove
away
again
,
or
the
clattering
of
horses
'
hoofs
in
the
stables
behind
,
it
became
almost
unbearable
.
 
<EOS>
The
boots
occasionally
moved
an
inch
or
two
,
to
knock
superfluous
bits
of
wax
off
the
candles
,
which
were
burning
low
,
but
instantaneously
resumed
his
former
position
;
and
as
he
remembered
to
have
heard
,
somewhere
or
other
,
that
the
human
eye
had
an
unfailing
effect
in
controlling
mad
people
,
he
kept
his
solitary
organ
of
vision
constantly
fixed
on
Mr
Alexander
Trott
.
 
<EOS>
That
unfortunate
individual
stared
at
his
companion
in
his
turn
,
until
his
features
grew
more
and
more
indistinct
---
his
hair
gradually
less
red
---
and
the
room
more
misty
and
obscure
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Alexander
Trott
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
,
from
which
he
was
awakened
by
a
rumbling
in
the
street
,
and
a
cry
of
"
Chaise
-
and
-
four
for
number
twenty
-
five
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
bustle
on
the
stairs
succeeded
;
the
room
door
was
hastily
thrown
open
;
and
Mr
Joseph
Overton
entered
,
followed
by
four
stout
waiters
,
and
Mrs
Williamson
,
the
stout
landlady
of
the
Winglebury
Arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Overton
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Alexander
Trott
,
jumping
up
in
a
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
this
man
,
sir
;
consider
the
situation
in
which
I
have
been
placed
for
three
hours
past
---
the
person
you
sent
to
guard
me
,
sir
,
was
a
madman
---
a
madman
---
a
raging
,
ravaging
,
furious
madman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mr
Overton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
compassionate
Mrs
Williamson
,
"
mad
people
always
thinks
other
people
's
mad
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Alexander
Trott
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
poor
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Are
you
the
landlady
of
this
house
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
replied
the
stout
old
lady
,
"
do
n't
exert
yourself
,
there
's
a
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Consider
your
health
,
now
;
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Exert
myself
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Mr
Alexander
Trott
;
<EOS>
"
it
's
a
mercy
,
ma'am
,
that
I
have
any
breath
to
exert
myself
with
!
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
been
assassinated
three
hours
ago
by
that
one
-
eyed
monster
with
the
oakum
head
.
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
have
a
madman
,
ma'am
<EOS>
---
how
dare
you
have
a
madman
,
to
assault
and
terrify
the
visitors
to
your
house
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
have
another
,
"
said
Mrs
Williamson
,
casting
a
look
of
reproach
at
the
mayor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
,
capital
,
"
whispered
Overton
again
,
as
he
enveloped
Mr
Alexander
Trott
in
a
thick
travelling
-
cloak
.
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
,
sir
!
"
exclaimed
Trott
,
aloud
;
"
it
's
horrible
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
recollection
makes
me
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
fight
four
duels
in
three
hours
,
if
I
survived
the
first
three
,
than
I
'd
sit
for
that
time
face
to
face
with
a
madman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
it
up
,
my
lord
,
as
you
go
down
-
stairs
,
"
whispered
Overton
,
"
your
bill
is
paid
,
and
your
portmanteau
in
the
chaise
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
added
aloud
,
"
<EOS>
Now
,
waiters
,
the
gentleman
's
ready
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
signal
,
the
waiters
crowded
round
Mr
Alexander
Trott
.
 
<EOS>
One
took
one
arm
;
another
,
the
other
;
a
third
,
walked
before
with
a
candle
;
the
fourth
,
behind
with
another
candle
;
the
boots
and
Mrs
Williamson
brought
up
the
rear
;
and
down
-
stairs
<EOS>
they
went
:
 
<EOS>
Mr
Alexander
Trott
expressing
alternately
at
the
very
top
of
his
voice
either
his
feigned
reluctance
to
go
,
or
his
unfeigned
indignation
at
being
shut
up
with
a
madman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Overton
was
waiting
at
the
chaise
-
door
,
the
boys
were
ready
mounted
,
and
a
few
ostlers
and
stable
nondescripts
were
standing
round
to
witness
the
departure
of
"
the
mad
gentleman
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Alexander
Trott
's
foot
was
on
the
step
,
when
he
observed
(
which
the
dim
light
had
prevented
his
doing
before
)
<EOS>
a
figure
seated
in
the
chaise
,
closely
muffled
up
in
a
cloak
like
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
of
Overton
,
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
,
"
replied
the
mayor
:
 
"
the
other
party
of
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
other
party
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Trott
,
with
an
effort
to
retreat
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
;
you
'll
soon
find
that
out
,
before
you
go
far
,
I
should
think
---
but
make
a
noise
,
you
'll
excite
suspicion
if
you
whisper
to
me
so
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
go
in
this
chaise
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Mr
Alexander
Trott
,
all
his
original
fears
recurring
with
tenfold
violence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
assassinated
---
I
shall
be
---
"
   
"
Bravo
,
bravo
,
"
whispered
Overton
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
push
you
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
wo
n't
go
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Trott
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help
here
,
help
!
 
<EOS>
They
're
carrying
me
away
against
my
will
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
plot
to
murder
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
!
"
said
Mrs
Williamson
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
boys
,
put
'em
along
,
"
cried
the
mayor
,
pushing
Trott
in
and
slamming
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Off
with
you
,
as
quick
as
you
can
,
and
stop
for
nothing
till
you
come
to
the
next
stage
---
all
right
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Horses
are
paid
,
Tom
,
"
screamed
Mrs
Williamson
;
and
away
went
the
chaise
,
at
the
rate
of
fourteen
miles
an
hour
,
with
Mr
Alexander
Trott
and
Miss
Julia
Manners
carefully
shut
up
in
the
inside
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Alexander
Trott
remained
coiled
up
in
one
corner
of
the
chaise
,
and
his
mysterious
companion
in
the
other
,
for
the
first
two
or
three
miles
;
<EOS>
Mr
Trott
edging
more
and
more
into
his
corner
,
as
he
felt
his
companion
gradually
edging
more
and
more
from
hers
;
and
vainly
endeavouring
in
the
darkness
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
furious
face
of
the
supposed
Horace
Hunter
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
may
speak
now
,
"
said
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
at
length
;
"
the
post
-
boys
can
neither
see
nor
hear
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
Hunter
's
voice
!
"
<EOS>
---
thought
Alexander
,
astonished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lord
Peter
!
"
said
Miss
Julia
,
most
winningly
:
 
putting
her
arm
on
Mr
Trott
's
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lord
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
a
woman
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Trott
,
in
a
low
tone
of
excessive
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Whose
voice
is
that
?
"
said
Julia
;
"
'
tis
not
<EOS>
Lord
Peter
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
---
it
's
mine

"
replied
Mr
Trott
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yours
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Miss
Julia
Manners
;
"
a
strange
man
!
 
<EOS>
Gracious
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
How
came
you
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whoever
you
are
,
you
might
have
known
that
I
came
against
my
will
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Alexander
,
"
for
I
made
noise
enough
when
I
got
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
come
from
Lord
Peter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Manners
.
   
<EOS>
"
Confound
Lord
Peter
,
"
replied
Trott
pettishly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
any
Lord
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
of
him
before
to
-
night
,
when
I
've
been
Lord
Peter'd
by
one
and
Lord
Peter'd
by
another
,
<EOS>
till
I
verily
believe
I
'm
mad
,
or
dreaming
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Whither
are
we
going
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
lady
tragically
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Trott
with
singular
coolness
;
for
the
events
of
the
evening
had
completely
hardened
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
stop
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
lady
,
letting
down
the
front
glasses
of
the
chaise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
my
dear
ma'am
!
"
said
Mr
Trott
,
pulling
the
glasses
up
again
with
one
hand
,
and
gently
squeezing
Miss
Julia
's
waist
with
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
mistake
here
;
give
me
till
the
end
of
this
stage
to
explain
my
share
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
go
so
far
;
you
can
not
be
set
down
here
alone
,
at
this
hour
of
the
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
consented
;
the
mistake
was
mutually
explained
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Trott
was
a
young
man
,
had
highly
promising
whiskers
,
an
undeniable
tailor
,
and
an
insinuating
address
---
he
wanted
nothing
but
valour
,
and
who
wants
that
with
three
thousand
a
-
year
?
 
<EOS>
The
lady
had
this
,
and
more
;
she
wanted
a
young
husband
,
and
the
only
course
open
to
Mr
Trott
to
retrieve
his
disgrace
<EOS>
was
a
rich
wife
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
have
all
this
trouble
and
expense
for
nothing
;
and
that
as
they
were
so
far
on
the
road
already
,
they
had
better
go
to
Gretna
Green
,
and
marry
each
other
;
and
they
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
very
next
preceding
entry
in
the
Blacksmith
's
book
,
was
an
entry
of
the
marriage
of
Emily
Brown
with
Horace
Hunter
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hunter
took
his
wife
home
,
and
begged
pardon
,
and
WAS
pardoned
;
and
Mr
Trott
took
HIS
wife
home
,
begged
pardon
too
,
and
was
pardoned
also
.
 
<EOS>
And
Lord
Peter
,
who
had
been
detained
beyond
his
time
by
drinking
champagne
and
riding
a
steeple
-
chase
,
went
back
to
the
Honourable
Augustus
Flair
's
,
and
drank
more
champagne
,
and
rode
another
steeple
-
chase
,
and
was
thrown
and
killed
.
 
<EOS>
And
Horace
Hunter
took
great
credit
to
himself
for
practising
on
the
cowardice
of
Alexander
Trott
;
and
all
these
circumstances
were
discovered
in
time
,
and
carefully
noted
down
;
and
if
you
ever
stop
a
week
at
the
Winglebury
Arms
,
they
will
give
you
just
this
account
of
The
Great
Winglebury
Duel
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Joseph
Porter
Most
extensive
were
the
preparations
at
Rose
Villa
,
Clapham
Rise
,
in
the
occupation
of
Mr
Gattleton
(
a
stock
-
broker
in
especially
comfortable
circumstances
)
,
and
great
was
the
anxiety
of
Mr
Gattleton
's
interesting
family
,
as
the
day
fixed
for
the
representation
of
the
Private
Play
which
had
been
"
many
months
in
preparation
,
"
approached
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
family
was
infected
with
the
mania
for
Private
Theatricals
;
the
house
,
usually
so
clean
and
tidy
,
was
,
to
use
Mr
Gattleton
's
expressive
description
,
"
regularly
turned
out
o
'
windows
;
"
the
large
dining
-
room
,
dismantled
of
its
furniture
,
and
ornaments
,
presented
a
strange
jumble
of
flats
,
flies
,
wings
,
lamps
,
bridges
,
clouds
,
thunder
and
lightning
,
festoons
and
flowers
,
daggers
and
foil
,
and
various
other
messes
in
theatrical
slang
included
under
the
comprehensive
name
of
"
properties
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
bedrooms
were
crowded
with
scenery
,
the
kitchen
was
occupied
by
carpenters
.
 
<EOS>
Rehearsals
took
place
every
other
night
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
every
sofa
in
the
house
was
more
or
less
damaged
by
the
perseverance
and
spirit
with
which
Mr
Sempronius
Gattleton
,
and
Miss
Lucina
,
rehearsed
the
smothering
scene
in
"
Othello
"
---
it
having
been
determined
that
that
tragedy
should
form
the
first
portion
of
the
evening
's
entertainments
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
we
're
a
LEETLE
more
perfect
,
I
think
it
will
go
admirably
,
"
said
Mr
Sempronius
,
addressing
his
CORPS
DRAMATIQUE
,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hundred
and
fiftieth
rehearsal
.
 
<EOS>
In
consideration
of
his
sustaining
the
trifling
inconvenience
of
bearing
all
the
expenses
of
the
play
,
Mr
Sempronius
had
been
,
in
the
most
handsome
manner
,
unanimously
elected
stage
-
manager
.
 
<EOS>
"
Evans
,
"
continued
Mr
Gattleton
,
the
younger
,
addressing
a
tall
,
thin
,
pale
young
gentleman
,
with
extensive
whiskers
---
"
Evans
,
you
play
RODERIGO
beautifully
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beautifully
,
"
echoed
the
three
Miss
Gattletons
;
for
Mr
Evans
was
pronounced
by
all
his
lady
friends
to
be
"
quite
a
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
looked
so
interesting
,
and
had
such
lovely
whiskers
:
 
to
say
nothing
of
his
talent
for
writing
verses
in
albums
and
playing
the
flute
!
<EOS>
RODERIGO
simpered
and
bowed
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
,
"
added
the
manager
,
"
you
are
hardly
perfect
in
the
---
fall
---
in
the
fencing
-
scene
,
where
you
are
---
you
understand
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
difficult
,
"
said
Mr
Evans
,
thoughtfully
;
<EOS>
"
I
've
fallen
about
,
a
good
deal
,
in
our
counting
-
house
lately
,
for
practice
,
only
I
find
it
hurts
one
so
.
 
<EOS>
Being
obliged
to
fall
backward
<EOS>
you
see
,
it
bruises
one
's
head
a
good
deal
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
take
care
<EOS>
you
do
n't
knock
a
wing
down
,
"
said
Mr
Gattleton
,
the
elder
,
who
had
been
appointed
prompter
,
and
who
took
as
much
interest
in
the
play
as
the
youngest
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
stage
is
very
narrow
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
n't
be
afraid
,
"
said
Mr
Evans
,
with
a
very
self
-
satisfied
air
;
"
I
shall
fall
with
my
head
"
off
,
"
and
then
I
ca
n't
do
any
harm
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
egad
,
"
said
the
manager
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
"
we
shall
make
a
decided
hit
in
"
Masaniello
.
"
 
<EOS>
Harleigh
sings
that
music
admirably
.
"
   
<EOS>
Everybody
echoed
the
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harleigh
smiled
,
and
looked
foolish
---
not
an
unusual
thing
with
him
---
hummed
"
 
Behold
how
brightly
breaks
the
morning
,
"
and
blushed
as
red
as
the
fisherman
's
nightcap
he
was
trying
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
's
see
,
"
resumed
the
manager
,
telling
the
number
on
his
fingers
,
"
we
shall
have
three
dancing
female
peasants
,
besides
FENELLA
,
and
four
fishermen
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
's
our
man
Tom
;
he
can
have
a
pair
of
ducks
of
mine
,
and
a
check
shirt
of
Bob
's
,
and
a
red
nightcap
,
and
he
'll
do
for
another
<EOS>
---
that
's
five
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
choruses
,
of
course
,
we
can
sing
at
the
sides
;
and
in
the
market
-
scene
we
can
walk
about
in
cloaks
and
things
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
revolt
takes
place
,
Tom
must
keep
rushing
in
on
one
side
and
out
on
the
other
,
with
a
pickaxe
,
as
fast
as
he
can
.
 
<EOS>
The
effect
will
be
electrical
;
it
will
look
exactly
as
if
there
were
an
immense
number
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
the
eruption
-
scene
we
must
burn
the
red
fire
,
and
upset
the
tea
-
trays
,
and
make
all
sorts
of
noises
---
and
it
's
sure
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sure
!
sure
!
<EOS>
"
cried
all
the
performers
UNA
VOCE
---
and
away
hurried
Mr
Sempronius
Gattleton
to
wash
the
burnt
cork
off
his
face
,
and
superintend
the
"
setting
up
"
of
some
of
the
amateur
-
painted
,
but
never
-
sufficiently
-
to
-
be
-
admired
,
scenery
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gattleton
was
a
kind
,
good
-
tempered
,
vulgar
soul
,
exceedingly
fond
of
her
husband
and
children
,
and
entertaining
only
three
dislikes
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
she
had
a
natural
antipathy
to
anybody
else
's
unmarried
daughters
;
in
the
second
,
she
was
in
bodily
fear
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
ridicule
;
lastly
---
almost
a
necessary
consequence
of
this
feeling
---
she
regarded
,
with
feelings
of
the
utmost
horror
,
<EOS>
one
Mrs
Joseph
Porter
over
the
way
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
good
folks
of
Clapham
and
its
vicinity
stood
very
much
in
awe
of
scandal
and
sarcasm
;
and
thus
Mrs
Joseph
Porter
was
courted
,
and
flattered
,
and
caressed
,
and
invited
,
for
much
the
same
reason
that
induces
a
poor
author
,
without
a
farthing
in
his
pocket
,
to
behave
with
extraordinary
civility
to
a
twopenny
postman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
ma
,
"
said
Miss
Emma
Porter
,
in
colloquy
with
her
respected
relative
,
and
trying
to
look
unconcerned
;
"
if
they
had
invited
me
,
you
know
that
neither
you
nor
pa
would
have
allowed
me
to
take
part
in
such
an
exhibition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
what
I
should
have
thought
from
your
high
sense
of
propriety
,
"
returned
the
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
,
Emma
,
you
know
how
to
designate
the
proceeding
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
P
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
had
only
the
week
before
made
"
an
exhibition
"
of
herself
for
four
days
,
behind
a
counter
at
a
fancy
fair
,
to
all
and
every
of
her
Majesty
's
liege
subjects
who
were
disposed
to
pay
a
shilling
each
for
the
privilege
of
seeing
some
four
dozen
girls
flirting
with
strangers
,
and
playing
at
shop
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mrs
Porter
,
looking
out
of
window
;
"
there
are
two
rounds
of
beef
and
a
ham
going
in
---
clearly
for
sandwiches
;
and
Thomas
,
the
pastry
-
cook
,
says
,
there
have
been
twelve
dozen
tarts
ordered
,
besides
blancmange
and
jellies
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
!
<EOS>
think
of
the
Miss
Gattletons
in
fancy
dresses
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
too
ridiculous
!
"
said
Miss
Porter
,
hysterically
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
manage
to
put
them
a
little
out
of
conceit
with
the
business
,
however
,
"
said
Mrs
Porter
;
and
out
she
went
on
her
charitable
errand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
Mrs
Gattleton
,
"
said
Mrs
Joseph
Porter
,
after
they
had
been
closeted
for
some
time
,
and
when
,
by
dint
of
indefatigable
pumping
,
she
had
managed
to
extract
all
the
news
about
the
play
,
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
people
may
say
what
they
please
;
indeed
we
know
they
will

for
some

are
SO
ill

natured

<EOS>
Ah
,
my
dear
Miss
Lucina
,
how
d'ye
do

<EOS>
I
was
just
telling
your
mamma
that
I
have
heard

said
,
that
---
"
   
"
What
?
"
   
"
Mrs
Porter
is
alluding
to
the
play
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Gattleton
;
"
she
was
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
just
informing
me
that
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Oh
,
now
pray
do
n't
mention
it
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Porter
;
"
it
's
most
absurd
---
quite
as
absurd
as
young
What's
-
his

name
saying
he
wondered
how
Miss
Caroline
,
with
such
a
foot
and
ankle
,
could
have
the
vanity
to
play
FENELLA
.
"
   
"
Highly
impertinent
,
whoever
said
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Gattleton
,
bridling
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
,
"
chimed
in
the
delighted
Mrs
Porter
;
"
most
undoubtedly
!
 
<EOS>
Because
,
as
I
said
,
if
Miss
Caroline
DOES
play
FENELLA
,
it
does
n't
follow
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
she
should
think
she
has
a
pretty
foot
;
---
and
then
---
such
puppies
as
these
young
men
are
---
he
had
the
impudence
to
say
,
that
---
"
   
How
far
the
amiable
Mrs
Porter
might
have
succeeded
in
her
pleasant
purpose
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
,
had
not
the
entrance
of
Mr
Thomas
Balderstone
,
Mrs
Gattleton
's
brother
,
familiarly
called
in
the
family
"
Uncle
Tom
,
"
changed
the
course
of
conversation
,
and
suggested
to
her
mind
an
excellent
plan
of
operation
on
the
evening
of
the
play
.
   
<EOS>
Uncle
Tom
was
very
rich
,
and
exceedingly
fond
of
his
nephews
and
nieces
:
 
as
a
matter
of
course
,
therefore
,
he
was
an
object
of
great
importance
in
his
own
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
the
best
-
hearted
men
in
existence
:
 
always
in
a
good
temper
,
and
always
talking
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
boast
that
he
wore
top
-
boots
on
all
occasions
,
and
had
never
worn
a
black
silk
neckerchief
;
and
it
was
his
pride
that
he
remembered
all
the
principal
plays
of
Shakspeare
from
beginning
to
end
---
and
so
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
of
this
parrot
-
like
accomplishment
was
,
that
he
was
not
only
perpetually
quoting
himself
,
but
that
he
could
never
sit
by
,
and
hear
a
misquotation
from
the
"
Swan
of
Avon
"
without
setting
the
unfortunate
delinquent
right
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
also
something
of
a
wag
;
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
saying
what
he
considered
a
good
thing
,
and
invariably
laughed
until
he
cried
at
anything
that
appeared
to
him
mirth
-
moving
or
ridiculous
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
girls
!
"
said
Uncle
Tom
,
after
the
preparatory
ceremony
of
kissing
and
how

been
gone

"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well

returned
Mr
Sempronius
,
who
had
just
appeared
,
looking
something
like
a
ringdove
,
with
a
small
circle
round
each
eye
:
 
<EOS>
the

of
his
constant
corking

Of

"
What

<EOS>
whispered
Mrs
Joseph

;
"
you
would
have
been

"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
flatter
myself
,
I
SHOULD
have
been
tolerably
up
to

"
responded
Uncle

.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
bespeak

resumed
Mrs

;

then
,

it

"
   
"
Certainly

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is

"
said
Mrs
Gattleton
to
her
daughters
,
as
they
were
sitting
round
the
fire
in
the
evening
,
looking
over
their
parts
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
really
very
much
wish
Mrs
Joseph
Porter
was
n't
coming
on
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
's
scheming
something
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
ca
n't
make
us
ridiculous
,
however
,
"
observed
Mr
Sempronius
Gattleton
,
haughtily
.
   
<EOS>
The
long
-
looked
-
for
Thursday
arrived
in
due
course
,
and
brought
with
it
,
as
Mr
Gattleton
,
senior
,
philosophically
observed
,
"
no
disappointments
,
to
speak
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
True
,
it
was
yet
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
CASSIO
would
be
enabled
to
get
into
the
dress
which
had
been
sent
for
him
from
the
masquerade
warehouse
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
equally
uncertain
whether
the
principal
female
singer
would
be
sufficiently
recovered
from
the
influenza
to
make
her
appearance
;
Mr
Harleigh
,
the
MASANIELLO
of
the
night
,
was
hoarse
,
and
rather
unwell
,
in
consequence
of
the
great
quantity
of
lemon
and
sugar
-
candy
<EOS>
he
had
eaten
to
improve
his
voice
;
and
two
flutes
and
a
violoncello
had
pleaded
severe
colds
.
 
<EOS>
What
of
that
?
<EOS>
the
audience
were
all
coming
.
<EOS>
Everybody
knew
his
part
:
 
the
dresses
were
covered
with
tinsel
and
spangles
;
the
white
plumes
looked
beautiful
;
Mr
Evans
had
practised
falling
until
he
was
bruised
from
head
to
foot
and
quite
perfect
;
IAGO
was
sure
that
,
in
the
stabbing
-
scene
,
he
should
make
"
a
decided
hit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
self
-
taught
deaf
gentleman
,
who
had
kindly
offered
to
bring
his
flute
,
would
be
a
most
valuable
addition
to
the
orchestra
;
Miss
Jenkins
's
talent
for
the
piano
was
too
well
known
to
be
doubted
for
an
instant
;
Mr
Cape
had
practised
the
violin
accompaniment
with
her
frequently
;
and
Mr
Brown
,
who
had
kindly
undertaken
,
at
a
few
hours
'
notice
,
to
bring
his
violoncello
,
<EOS>
would
,
no
doubt
,
manage
extremely
well
.
   
<EOS>
Seven
o'clock
came
,
and
so
did
the
audience
;
all
the
rank
and
fashion
of
Clapham
and
its
vicinity
was
fast
filling
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
Smiths
,
the
Gubbinses
,
the
Nixons
,
the
Dixons
,
the
Hicksons
,
people
with
all
sorts
of
names
,
two
aldermen
,
a
sheriff
in
perspective
,
Sir
Thomas
Glumper
(
who
had
been
knighted
in
the
last
reign
for
carrying
up
an
address
on
somebody
's
escaping
from
nothing
)
;
and
last
,
not
least
,
there
were
Mrs
Joseph
Porter
and
Uncle
Tom
,
seated
in
the
centre
of
the
third
row
from
the
stage
;
Mrs
P
amusing
Uncle
Tom
with
all
sorts
of
stories
,
and
Uncle
Tom
amusing
every
one
else
by
laughing
most
immoderately
.
   
<EOS>
Ting
,
ting
,
ting
!
<EOS>
went
the
prompter
's
bell
at
eight
o'clock
precisely
,
and
dash
went
the
orchestra
into
the
overture
to
"
The
Men
of
Prometheus
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
pianoforte
player
hammered
away
with
laudable
perseverance
;
and
the
violoncello
,
which
struck
in
at
intervals
,
"
sounded
very
well
,
considering
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
individual
,
however
,
who
had
undertaken
to
play
the
flute
accompaniment
"
at
sight
<EOS>
,
"
found
,
from
fatal
experience
,
the
perfect
truth
of
the
old
adage
,
"
ought
of
sight
,
out
of
mind
;
"
for
being
very
near
-
sighted
,
and
being
placed
at
a
considerable
distance
from
his
music
-
book
,
all
he
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
was
to
play
a
bar
now
and
then
in
the
wrong
place
,
and
put
the
other
performers
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
however
,
but
justice
to
Mr
Brown
to
say
that
he
did
this
to
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
The
overture
,
in
fact
,
was
not
unlike
a
race
between
the
different
instruments
;
the
piano
came
in
first
by
several
bars
,
and
the
violoncello
next
,
quite
distancing
the
poor
flute
;
for
the
deaf
gentleman
TOO
-
TOO'D
away
,
quite
unconscious
that
he
was
at
all
wrong
,
until
apprised
,
by
the
applause
of
the
audience
,
that
the
overture
was
concluded
.
 
<EOS>
A
considerable
bustle
and
shuffling
of
feet
was
then
heard
upon
the
stage
,
accompanied
by
whispers
of
"
Here
's
a
pretty
go
!
<EOS>
---
what
's
to
be
done
?
"
&
c.
 
<EOS>
The
audience
applauded
again
,
by
way
of
raising
the
spirits
of
the
performers
;
and
then
Mr
Sempronius
desired
the
prompter
,
in
a
very
audible
voice
,
to
"
clear
the
stage
,
and
ring
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ting
,
ting
,
ting
!
<EOS>
went
the
bell
again
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
sat
down
;
the
curtain
shook
;
rose
sufficiently
high
to
display
several
pair
of
yellow
boots
paddling
about
;
and
there
remained
.
   
<EOS>
Ting
,
ting
,
ting
!
<EOS>
went
the
bell
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
curtain
was
violently
convulsed
,
but
rose
no
higher
;
the
audience
tittered
;
Mrs
Porter
looked
at
Uncle
Tom
;
Uncle
Tom
looked
at
everybody
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
laughing
with
perfect
rapture
.
 
<EOS>
After
as
much
ringing
with
the
little
bell
as
a
muffin
-
boy
would
make
in
going
down
a
tolerably
long
street
,
and
a
vast
deal
of
whispering
,
hammering
,
and
calling
for
nails
and
cord
,
the
curtain
at
length
rose
,
and
discovered
Mr
Sempronius
Gattleton
SOLUS
,
and
decked
for
OTHELLO
.
<EOS>
After
three
distinct
rounds
of
applause
,
during
which
Mr
Sempronius
applied
his
right
hand
to
his
left
breast
,
and
bowed
in
the
most
approved
manner
,
the
manager
advanced
and
said
:
   
"
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
---
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
is
with
sincere
regret
,
that
I
regret
to
be

to
inform
you
,
that
IAGO
who
was
to
have
played
Mr
Wilson
---
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Ladies
and

,
but
I
am
naturally
somewhat
agitated

<EOS>

I
mean
,
Mr

was

have
played

---
that

been

or
,
in
other
words
,
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
,
the
fact
is
,
that
I
have
just
received
a
note
,
in
which
I
am
informed
that
IAGO
is
unavoidably
detained
at
the
Post
-
office
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
I
trust
---
a
---
a
---
amateur
performance
---
a
---
another
gentleman
undertaken
to
read
the
part
---
request
indulgence
for
a
short
time
---
courtesy
and
kindness
of
a
British
audience
.
"
<EOS>
Overwhelming
applause
.
 
<EOS>
Exit
Mr
Sempronius
Gattleton
,
and
curtain
falls
.
   
<EOS>
The
audience
were
,
of
course
,
exceedingly
good
-
humoured
;
the
whole
business
was
a
joke
;
and
accordingly
they
waited
for
an
hour
with
the
utmost
patience
,
being
enlivened
by
an
interlude
of
rout
-
cakes
and
lemonade
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
by
Mr
Sempronius
's
subsequent
explanation
,
that
the
delay
would
not
have
been
so
great
,
<EOS>
had
it
not
so
happened
that
when
the
substitute
IAGO
had
finished
dressing
,
and
just
as
the
play
was
on
the
point
of
commencing
,
the
original
IAGO
unexpectedly
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
was
therefore
compelled
to
undress
,
and
the
latter
to
dress
for
his
part
;
which
,
as
he
found
some
difficulty
in
getting
into
his
clothes
,
occupied
no
inconsiderable
time
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
tragedy
began
in
real
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
It
went
off
well
enough
,
until
the
third
scene
of
the
first
act
,
in
which
OTHELLO
addresses
the
Senate
:
 
<EOS>
the
only
remarkable
circumstance
being
,
that
as
IAGO
could
not
get
on
any
of
the
stage
boots
,
in
consequence
of
his
feet
being
violently
swelled
with
the
heat
and
excitement
<EOS>
,
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
playing
the
part
in
a
pair
of
Wellingtons
,
which
contrasted
rather
oddly
with
his
richly
embroidered
pantaloons
.
 
<EOS>
When
OTHELLO
started
with
his
address
to
the
Senate
(
whose
dignity
was
represented
by
,
the
DUKE
,
<EOS>
A
carpenter
,
two
men
engaged
on
the
recommendation
of
the
gardener
,
and
a
boy
)
,
Mrs
Porter
found
the
opportunity
she
so
anxiously
sought
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sempronius
proceeded
:
   
"
"
Most
potent
,
grave
,
and
reverend
signiors
,
My
very

approv'd

<EOS>
That

ta'en

It
is
most
true
;
---
rude
am
I
in
my
speech

"
"
   
"
Is
that
right

"
<EOS>
whispered
Mrs
Porter
to
Uncle
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
so
,
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will

<EOS>
Sem

"
called
out
Uncle
Tom
,
"
that
's
wrong
,
my
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
wrong
,
uncle
?
"
demanded
OTHELLO
,
quite
forgetting
the
dignity
of
his
situation
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
've
left
out
something
.
 
<EOS>
"
True
I
have
married
---
"
"
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
ah
!
"
said
Mr
Sempronius
,
endeavouring
to
hide
his
confusion
as
much
and
as
ineffectually
as
the
audience
attempted
to
conceal
their
half
-
suppressed
tittering
,
by
coughing
with
extraordinary
violence
<EOS>
---
   
---
<EOS>
"
"
true
I
have
married
her
;
---
The
very
head
and
front
of
my
offending

this
extent

<EOS>
(
ASIDE
)
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
prompt
,
father
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
've
mislaid
my
spectacles
,
"
said
poor
Mr
Gattleton
,
almost
dead
with
the
heat
and
bustle
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
now
it
's
"
rude
am
I
,
"
"
said
Uncle
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
know
it
is
,
"
returned
the
unfortunate
manager
,
proceeding
with
his
part
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
useless
and
tiresome
to
quote
the
number
of
instances
in
which
Uncle
Tom
,
now
completely
in
his
element
,
and
instigated
by
the
mischievous
Mrs
Porter
,
corrected
the
mistakes
of
the
performers
;
suffice
it
to
say
,
that
having
mounted
his
hobby
,
nothing
could
induce
him
to
dismount
;
so
,
during
the
whole
remainder
of
the
play
,
he
performed
a
kind
of
running
accompaniment
,
by
muttering
everybody
's
part
as
it
was
being
delivered
,
in
an
under
-
tone
.
 
<EOS>
The
audience
were
highly
amused
,
Mrs
Porter
delighted
,
the
performers
embarrassed
;
Uncle
Tom
never
was
better
pleased
in
all
his
life
;
and
Uncle
Tom
's
nephews
and
nieces
<EOS>
had
never
,
although
the
declared
heirs
to
his
large
property
,
so
heartily
wished
him
gathered
to
his
fathers
as
on
that
memorable
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Several
other
minor
causes
,
too
,
united
to
damp
the
ardour
of
the
DRAMATIS
PERSONAE
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
the
performers
could
walk
in
their
tights
,
or
move
their
arms
in
their
jackets
;
the
pantaloons
were
too
small
,
the
boots
too
large
,
and
the
swords
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Evans
,
naturally
too
tall
for
the
scenery
,
wore
a
black
velvet
hat
with
immense
white
plumes
,
the
glory
of
which
was
lost
in
"
the
flies
;
"
and
the
only
other
inconvenience
of
which
was
,
that
when
it
was
off
his
head
he
could
not
put
it
on
,
and
when
it
was
on
<EOS>
he
could
not
take
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
his
practice
,
too
,
he
fell
with
his
head
and
shoulders
as
neatly
through
one
of
the
side
scenes
,
as
a
harlequin
would
jump
through
a
panel
in
a
Christmas
pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
The
pianoforte
player
,
overpowered
by
the
extreme
heat
of
the
room
,
fainted
away
at
the
commencement
of
the
entertainments
,
leaving
the
music
of
"
Masaniello
"
to
the
flute
and
violoncello
.
 
<EOS>
The
orchestra
complained
that
Mr
Harleigh
put
them
out
,
and
Mr
Harleigh
declared
that
the
orchestra
prevented
his
singing
a
note
.
 
<EOS>
The
fishermen
,
who
were
hired
for
the
occasion
,
revolted
to
the
very
life
,
positively
refusing
to
play
without
an
increased
allowance
of
spirits
;
and
,
their
demand
being
complied
with
,
getting
drunk
in
the
eruption

The
red
fire
,
which
was
burnt
at
the
conclusion
of
the
second
act
,
not
only
nearly
suffocated
the
audience
,
but
nearly
set
the
house
on
fire
into
the
bargain
;
and
,
as
it
was
,
the
remainder
of
the
piece
was
acted
in
a
thick
fog
.
   
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
whole
affair
was
,
as
Mrs
Joseph
Porter
triumphantly
told
everybody
,
"
a
complete
failure
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
audience
went
home
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
exhausted
with
laughter
,
suffering
from
severe
headaches
,
and
smelling
terribly
of
brimstone
and
gunpowder
.

The
Messrs.
Gattleton
,
senior
and
junior
,
retired
to
rest
,
with
the
vague
idea
of
emigrating
to
Swan
River
early
in
the
ensuing

Rose
Villa
has
once
again
resumed
its
wonted
appearance
;
the
dining
-
room
furniture
has
been
replaced
;
the
tables
are
as
nicely
polished
as
formerly
;
the
horsehair
chairs
are
ranged
against
the
wall
,
as
regularly
as
ever
;
Venetian
blinds
have
been
fitted
to
every
window
in
the
house
to
intercept
the
prying
gaze
of
Mrs
Joseph
Porter
.

The
subject
of
theatricals
is
never
mentioned
in
the
Gattleton
family
,
unless
,
indeed
,
by
Uncle
Tom
,
who
can
not
refrain
from
sometimes
expressing
his
surprise
and
regret
at
finding
that
his
nephews
and
nieces
appear
to
have
lost
the
relish
they
once
possessed
for
the
beauties
of
Shakspeare

and
quotations
from
the
works
of
that
immortal
bard

A
Passage
in
the
life
of
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
Chapter
<EOS>
the
First
Matrimony
is
proverbially
a
serious
undertaking
.
 
<EOS>
Like
an
over
-
weening
predilection
for
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
it
is
a
misfortune
into
which
a
man
easily
falls
,
and
from
which
he
finds
it
remarkably
difficult
to
extricate
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
of
no
use
telling
a
man
who
is
timorous
on
these
points
,
that
it
is
but
one
plunge
,
and
all
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
same
thing
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
the
unfortunate
victims
derive
as
much
comfort
from
the
assurance
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
was
a
rather
uncommon
compound
of
strong
uxorious
inclinations
,
and
an
unparalleled
degree
of
anti
-
connubial
timidity
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
about
fifty
years
of
age
;
stood
four
feet
six
inches
and
three
-
quarters
in
his
socks
---
for
he
never
stood
in
stockings
at
all
---
plump
,
clean
,
and
rosy
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
something
like
a
vignette
to
one
of
Richardson
's
novels
,
and
had
a
clean
-
cravatish
formality
of
manner
,
and
kitchen
-
pokerness
of
carriage
,
which
Sir
Charles
Grandison
himself
might
have
envied
.
 
<EOS>
He
lived
on
an
annuity
,
which
was
well
adapted
to
the
individual
who
received
it
,
in
one
respect
---
it
was
rather
small
.
 
<EOS>
He
received
it
in
periodical
payments
on
every
alternate
Monday
;
but
he
ran
himself
out
,
about
a
day
after
the
expiration
of
the
first
week
,
as
regularly
as
an
eight
-
day
clock
;
and
then
,
to
make
the
comparison
complete
,
his
landlady
wound
him
up
,
and
he
went
on
with
a
regular
tick
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
had
long
lived
in
a
state
of
single
blessedness
,
as
bachelors
say
,
or
single
cursedness
,
as
spinsters
think
;
but
the
idea
of
matrimony
had
never
ceased
to
haunt
him
.
 
<EOS>
Wrapt
in
profound
reveries
on
this
never
-
failing
theme
,
fancy
transformed
his
small
parlour
in
Cecil
-
street
,
Strand
,
into
a
neat
house
in
the
suburbs
;
the
half
-
hundredweight
of
coals
under
the
kitchen
-
stairs
suddenly
sprang
up
into
three
tons
of
the
best
Walls
-
end
;
his
small
French
bedstead
was
converted
into
a
regular
matrimonial
four
-
poster
;
and
in
the
empty
chair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fireplace
,
imagination
seated
a
beautiful
young
lady
,
with
a
very
little
independence
or
will
of
her
own
,
and
a
very
large
independence
under
a
will
of
her
father
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
as
a
gentle
tap
at
his
room
-
door
disturbed
these
meditations
one
evening
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tottle
,
my
dear
fellow
,
how
DO
you
do
?
"
said
a
short
elderly
gentleman
with
a
gruffish
voice
,
bursting
into
the
room
,
and
replying
to
the
question
by
asking
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
Told
you
I
should
drop
in
some
evening
,
"
said
the
short
gentleman
,
as
he
delivered
his
hat
into
Tottle
's
hand
,
after
a
little
struggling
and
dodging
.
   
<EOS>
"
Delighted
to
see
you
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
wishing
internally
that
his
visitor
had
"
dropped
in
"
to
the
Thames
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
,
instead
of
dropping
into
his
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
The
fortnight
was
nearly
up
,
and
Watkins
was
hard
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
Mrs
Gabriel
Parsons
?
"
inquired
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
well
,
thank
you
,
"
replied
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
for
that
<EOS>
was
the
name
the
short
gentleman
revelled
in
.
 
<EOS>
Here
there
was
a
pause
;
the
short
gentleman
looked
at
the
left
hob
of
the
fireplace
;
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
stared
vacancy
out
of
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
well
,
"
repeated
the
short
gentleman
,
when
five
minutes
had
expired
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
say
remarkably
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
rubbed
the
palms
of
his
hands
as
hard
as
if
he
were
going
to
strike
a
light
by
friction
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
take
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tottle
,
with
the
desperate
suddenness
of
a
man
who
knew
that
unless
the
visitor
took
his
leave
,
he
stood
very
little
chance
of
taking
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
---
have
you
any
whiskey
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
Tottle
,
very
slowly
,
for
all
this
was
gaining
time
,
"
I
HAD
some
capital
,
and
remarkably
strong
whiskey
last
week
;
but
it
's
all
gone
---
and
therefore
its
strength
---
"
   
"
Is
much
beyond
proof
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
impossible
to
be
proved
,
"
said
the
short
gentleman
;
and
he
laughed
very
heartily
,
and
seemed
quite
glad
the
whiskey
had
been
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tottle
smiled
---
but
it
was
the
smile
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
had
done
laughing
,
he
delicately
insinuated
that
,
in
the
absence
of
whiskey
,
he
would
not
be
averse
to
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
lighting
a
flat
candle
very
ostentatiously
;
and
displaying
an
immense
key
,
which
belonged
to
the
street
-
door
,
but
which
,
for
the
sake
of
appearances
,
occasionally
did
duty
in
an
imaginary
wine
-
cellar
;
left
the
room
to
entreat
his
landlady
to
charge
their
glasses
,
and
charge
them
in
the
bill
.
 
<EOS>
The
application
was
successful
;
the
spirits
were
speedily
called
---
not
from
the
vasty
deep
,
but
the
adjacent
wine
-
vaults
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
short
gentlemen
mixed
their
grog
;
and
then
sat
cosily
down
before
the
fire
---
a
pair
of
shorts
,
airing
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tottle
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
"
you
know
my
way
---
off
-
hand
,
open
,
say
what
I
mean
,
mean
what
I
say
,
hate
reserve
,
and
ca
n't
bear
affectation
.
 
<EOS>
One
,
is
a
bad
domino
which
only
hides
what
good
people
have
about
'em
,
without
making
the
bad
look
better
;
and
the
other
is
much
about
the
same
thing
as
pinking
a
white
cotton
stocking
to
make
it
look
like
a
silk
one
.
 
<EOS>
Now
listen
to
what
I
'm
going
to
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
the
little
gentleman
paused
,
and
took
a
long
pull
at
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
took
a
sip
of
his
,
stirred
the
fire
,
and
assumed
an
air
of
profound
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
humming
and
ha'ing
about
the
matter
,
"
resumed
the
short
gentleman
.
<EOS>
---
"
You
want
to
get
married
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
evasively
;
for
he
trembled
violently
,
and
felt
a
sudden
tingling
throughout
his
whole
frame
;
"
why
---
I
should
certainly
---
at
least
,
I
THINK
I
should
like
---
"
   
"
Wo
n't
do
,
"
said
the
short
gentleman
.
<EOS>
---
"
Plain
and
free
---
or
there
's
an
end
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
want
money
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
admire
the
sex
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
'd
like
to
be
married
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
shall
be
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
an
end
of
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
saying
,
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
mixed
another
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
entreat
you
to
be
more
explanatory
,
"
said
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Really
,
as
the
party
principally
interested
,
I
can
not
consent
to
be
disposed
of
,
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
replied
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
warming
with
the
subject
,
and
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
---
"
I
know
a
lady
<EOS>
---
she
's
stopping
with
my
wife
now
---
<EOS>
who
is
just
the
thing
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
educated
;
talks
French
;
plays
the
piano
;
knows
a
good
deal
about
flowers
,
and
shells
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
;
and
has
five
hundred
a
year
,
with
an
uncontrolled
power
of
disposing
of
it
,
by
her
last
will
and
testament
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pay
my
addresses
to
her
,
"
said
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
n't
VERY
young
---
is
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
very
;
just
the
thing
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
said
that
already
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
coloured
hair
has
the
lady
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Egad
,
I
hardly
recollect
,
"
replied
Gabriel
,
with
coolness
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
ought
to
have
observed
,
at
first
,
she
wears
a
front
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
what
?
"
ejaculated
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
of
those
things
with
curls
,
along
here
,
"
said
Parsons
,
drawing
a
straight
line
across
his
forehead
,
just
over
his
eyes
,
in
illustration
of
his
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
front
's
black
;
I
ca
n't
speak
quite
positively
about
her
own
hair
;
because
,
unless
one
walks
behind
her
,
and
catches
a
glimpse
of
it
under
her
bonnet
,
one
seldom
sees
it
;
but
I
should
say
that
it
was
RATHER
lighter
than
the
front
---
a
shade
of
a
greyish
tinge
,
perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
looked
as
if
he
had
certain
misgivings
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
perceived
it
,
and
thought
it
would
be
safe
to
begin
the
next
attack
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
were
you
ever
in
love
,
Tottle
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
blushed
up
to
the
eyes
,
and
down
to
the
chin
,
and
exhibited
a
most
extensive
combination
of
colours
as
he
confessed
the
soft
impeachment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
popped
the
question
,
more
than
once
,
when
you
were
a
young
---
I
beg
your
pardon
---
a
younger
---
man
,
"
said
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
in
my
life
!
"
replied
his
friend
,
apparently
indignant
at
being
suspected
of
such
an
act
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
that
I
entertain
,
as
you
know
,
peculiar
opinions
on
these
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
of
ladies
,
young
or
old
---
far
from
it
;
but
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
that
in
compliance
with
the
custom
of
the
present
day
,
they
allow
too
much
freedom
of
speech
and
manner
to
marriageable
men
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
fact
is
,
that
anything
like
this
easy
freedom
I
never
could
acquire
;
and
as
I
am
always
afraid
of
going
too
far
,
I
am
generally
,
I
dare
say
,
considered
formal
and
cold
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder
if
you
were
,
"
replied
Parsons
,
gravely
;
"
I
should
n't
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
you
'll
be
all
right
in
this
case
;
for
the
strictness
and
delicacy
of
this
lady
's
ideas
greatly
exceed
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
why
,
when
she
came
to
our
house
,
there
was
an
old
portrait
of
some
man
or
other
,
with
two
large
,
black
,
staring
eyes
,
hanging
up
in
her
bedroom
;
she
positively
refused
to
go
to
bed
there
,
till
it
was
taken
down
,
considering
it
decidedly
wrong
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
too
,
"
said
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
;
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
the
other
night
---
I
never
laughed
so
much
in
my
life
"
---
resumed
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
;
"
I
had
driven
home
in
an
easterly
wind
,
and
caught
a
devil
of
a
face
-
ache
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
as
Fanny
---
that
's
Mrs
Parsons
,
you
know
---
and
this
friend
of
hers
,
and
I
,
and
Frank
Ross
,
were
playing
a
rubber
,
I
said
,
jokingly
,
that
when
I
went
to
bed
I
should
wrap
my
head
in
Fanny
's
flannel
petticoat
.
 
<EOS>
She
instantly
threw
up
her
cards
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
!
"
said
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
;
"
she
could
not
possibly
have
behaved
in
a
more
dignified
manner
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
?
---
<EOS>
Frank
took
dummy
;
and
I
won
sixpence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
did
n't
you
apologise
for
hurting
her
feelings
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Devil
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
at
breakfast
,
we
talked
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
She
contended
that
any
reference
to
a
flannel
petticoat
was
improper
;
---
men
ought
not
to
be
supposed
to
know
that
such
things
were
.
 
<EOS>
I
pleaded
my
coverture
;
being
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
the
lady
say
to
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tottle
,
deeply
interested
.
   
<EOS>
"
Changed
her
ground
,
and
said
that
Frank
being
a
single
man
,
its
impropriety
was
obvious
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Noble
-
minded
creature
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
enraptured
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
both
Fanny
<EOS>
and
I
said
,
at
once
,
that
she
was
regularly
cut
out
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
gleam
of
placid
satisfaction
shone
on
the
circular
face
of
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
as
he
heard
the
prophecy
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
one
thing
I
ca
n't
understand
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
as
he
rose
to
depart
;
"
I
can
not
,
for
the
life
and
soul
of
me
,
imagine
how
the
deuce
you
'll
ever
contrive
to
come
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
would
certainly
go
into
convulsions
if
the
subject
were
mentioned
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
sat
down
again
,
and
laughed
until
he
was
weak
.
 
<EOS>
Tottle
owed
him
money
,
so
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
laugh
at
Tottle
's
expense
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
feared
,
in
his
own
mind
,
that
this
was
another
characteristic
which
he
had
in
common
with
this
modern
Lucretia
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
accepted
the
invitation
to
dine
with
the
Parsonses
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
with
great
firmness
:
 
and
looked
forward
to
the
introduction
,
when
again
left
alone
,
with
tolerable
composure
.
   
<EOS>
The
sun
that
rose
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
had
never
beheld
a
sprucer
personage
on
the
outside
of
the
Norwood
stage
,
than
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
;
and
when
the
coach
drew
up
before
a
cardboard
-
looking
house
with
disguised
chimneys
,
and
a
lawn
like
a
large
sheet
of
green
letter
-
paper
,
he
certainly
had
never
lighted
to
his
place
of
destination
a
gentleman
who
felt
more
uncomfortable
.
   
<EOS>
The
coach
stopped
,
and
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
jumped
---
we
beg
his
pardon
---
alighted
,
with
great
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
!
"
said
he
,
and
away
went
the
coach
up
the
hill
with
that
beautiful
equanimity
of
pace
for
which
"
short
"
stages
are
generally
remarkable
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
gave
a
faltering
jerk
to
the
handle
of
the
garden
-
gate
bell
.
 
<EOS>
He
essayed
a
more
energetic
tug
,
and
his
previous
nervousness
was
not
at
all
diminished
by
hearing
the
bell
ringing
like
a
fire
alarum
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Parsons
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tottle
of
the
man
who
opened
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
hear
himself
speak
,
for
the
bell
had
not
yet
done
tolling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
,
"
shouted
a
voice
on
the
lawn
,
---
and
there
was
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
in
a
flannel
jacket
,
running
backwards
and
forwards
,
from
a
wicket
to
two
hats
piled
on
each
other
,
and
from
the
two
hats
to
the
wicket
,
in
the
most
violent
manner
,
while
another
gentleman
with
his
coat
off
was
getting
down
the
area
of
the
house
,
after
a
ball
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
gentleman
without
the
coat
had
found
it
---
which
he
did
in
less
than
ten
minutes
---
he
ran
back
to
the
hats
,
and
Gabriel
Parsons
pulled
up
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
gentleman
without
the
coat
called
out
"
play
,
"
very
loudly
,
and
bowled
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
knocked
the
ball
several
yards
,
and
took
another
run
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
other
gentleman
aimed
at
the
wicket
,
and
did
n't
hit
it
;
and
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
having
finished
running
on
his
own
account
,
laid
down
the
bat
and
ran
after
the
ball
,
which
went
into
a
neighbouring
field
.
 
<EOS>
They
called
this
cricket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tottle
,
will
you
"
go
in
?
"
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
as
he
approached
him
,
wiping
the
perspiration
off
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
declined
the
offer
,
the
bare
idea
of
accepting
which
made
him
even
warmer
than
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
we
'll
go
into
the
house
,
as
it
's
past
four
,
and
I
shall
have
to
wash
my
hands
before
dinner
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
I
hate
ceremony
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
Timson
,
that
's
Tottle
---
<EOS>
Tottle
,
that
's
Timson
;
bred
for
the
church
,
which
I
fear
will
never
be
bread
for
him
;
"
and
he
chuckled
at
the
old
joke
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Timson
bowed
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
bowed
stiffly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
led
the
way
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
rich
sugar
-
baker
,
who
mistook
rudeness
for
honesty
,
and
abrupt
bluntness
for
an
open
and
candid
manner
;
many
besides
Gabriel
mistake
bluntness
for
sincerity
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gabriel
Parsons
received
the
visitors
most
graciously
on
the
steps
,
and
preceded
them
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
sofa
,
was
seated
a
lady
of
very
prim
appearance
,
and
remarkably
inanimate
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
those
persons
at
whose
age
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
reasonable
guess
;
her
features
might
have
been
remarkably
pretty
when
she
was
younger
,
and
they
might
always
have
presented
the
same
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Her
complexion
---
with
a
slight
trace
of
powder
here
and
there
---
was
as
clear
as
that
of
a
well
-
made
wax
doll
,
and
her
face
as
expressive
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
handsomely
dressed
,
and
was
winding
up
a
gold
watch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lillerton
,
my
dear
,
this
is
our
friend
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
;
a
very
old
acquaintance
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
presenting
the
Strephon
of
Cecil
-
street
,
Strand
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
rose
,
and
made
a
deep
courtesy
;
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
made
a
bow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Splendid
,
majestic
creature
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Timson
advanced
,
and
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
began
to
hate
him
.
 
<EOS>
Men
generally
discover
a
rival
,
instinctively
,
and
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
felt
that
his
hate
was
deserved
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
beg
,
"
said
the
reverend
gentleman
,
---
"
May
I
beg
to
call
upon
you
,
Miss
Lillerton
,
for
some
trifling
donation
to
my
soup
,
coals
,
and
blanket
distribution
society
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Put
my
name
down
,
for
two
sovereigns
,
if
you
please
,
"
responded
Miss
Lillerton
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
truly
charitable
,
madam
,
"
said
the
Reverend
Mr
Timson
,
"
and
we
know
that
charity
will
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
beg
you
to
understand
that
I
do
not
say
this
from
the
supposition
that
you
have
many
sins
which
require
palliation
;
believe
me
when
I
say
that
I
never
yet
met
any
one
who
had
fewer
to
atone
for
,
than
Miss
Lillerton
.
"
   
<EOS>
Something
like
a
bad
imitation
of
animation
lighted
up
the
lady
's
face
,
as
she
acknowledged
the
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
Watkins
Tottle
incurred
the
sin
of
wishing
that
the
ashes
of
the
Reverend
Charles
Timson
were
quietly
deposited
in
the
churchyard
of
his
curacy
,
wherever
it
might
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
"
interrupted
Parsons
,
who
had
just
appeared
with
clean
hands
,
and
a
black
coat
,
"
it
's
my
private
opinion
,
Timson
,
that
your
"
distribution
society
"
is
rather
a
humbug
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
severe
,
"
replied
Timson
,
with
a
Christian
smile
:
 
he
disliked
Parsons
,
but
liked
his
dinners
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
positively
unjust
!
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
observed
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
looked
up
;
her
eyes
met
those
of
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
She
withdrew
them
in
a
sweet
confusion
,
and
Watkins
Tottle
did
the
same
---
the
confusion
was
mutual
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
urged
Mr
Parsons
,
pursuing
his
objections
,
"
what
on
earth
is
the
use
of
giving
a
man
coals
who
has
nothing
to
cook
,
or
giving
him
blankets
when
he
has
n't
a
bed
,
or
giving
him
soup
when
he
requires
substantial
food
?
---
"
like
sending
them
ruffles
when
wanting
a
shirt
.
"
 
<EOS>
Why
not
give
'em
a
trifle
of
money
,
as
I
do
,
when
I
think
they
deserve
it
,
and
let
them
purchase
what
they
think
best
?
 
<EOS>
Why
?
---
<EOS>
because
your
subscribers
would
n't
see
their
names
flourishing
in
print
on
the
church
-
door
---
that
's
the
reason
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Mr
Parsons
,
I
hope
you
do
n't
mean
to
insinuate
that
I
wish
to
see
MY
name
in
print
,
on
the
church
-
door
,
"
interrupted
Miss
Lillerton
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
putting
in
another
word
,
and
getting
another
glance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
would
n't
mind
seeing
it
in
writing
,
though
,
in
the
church
register
---
eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Register
!
 
<EOS>
What
register
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
lady
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
register
of
marriages
,
to
be
sure
,
"
replied
Parsons
,
chuckling
at
the
sally
,
and
glancing
at
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
thought
he
should
have
fainted
for
shame
,
and
it
is
quite
impossible
to
imagine
what
effect
the
joke
would
have
had
upon
the
lady
,
if
dinner
had
not
been
,
at
that
moment
,
announced
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
with
an
unprecedented
effort
of
gallantry
,
offered
the
tip
of
his
little
finger
;
Miss
Lillerton
accepted
it
gracefully
,
with
maiden
modesty
;
and
they
proceeded
in
due
state
to
the
dinner
-
table
,
where
they
were
soon
deposited
side
by
side
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
very
snug
,
the
dinner
very
good
,
and
the
little
party
in
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
The
conversation
became
pretty
general
,
and
when
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
had
extracted
one
or
two
cold
observations
from
his
neighbour
,
and
had
taken
wine
with
her
,
he
began
to
acquire
confidence
rapidly
.
 
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
removed
;
Mrs
Gabriel
Parsons
drank
four
glasses
of
port
on
the
plea
of
being
a
nurse
just
then
;
and
Miss
Lillerton
took
about
the
same
number
of
sips
,
on
the
plea
of
not
wanting
any
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
ladies
retired
,
to
the
great
gratification
of
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
who
had
been
coughing
and
frowning
at
his
wife
,
for
half
-
an
-
hour
previously
---
signals
which
Mrs
Parsons
never
happened
to
observe
,
until
she
had
been
pressed
to
take
her
ordinary
quantum
,
which
,
to
avoid
giving
trouble
,
she
generally
did
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
her
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
of
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
in
an
under
-
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
dote
on
her
with
enthusiasm
already
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
pray
let
us
drink
"
the
ladies
,
"
"
said
the
Reverend
Mr
Timson
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
ladies
!
"
said
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
emptying
his
glass
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
fulness
of
his
confidence
,
he
felt
as
if
he
could
make
love
to
a
dozen
ladies
,
off
-
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
"
I
remember
when
I
was
a
young
man
---
fill
your
glass
,
Timson
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
this
moment
emptied
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
fill
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
Timson
,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
"
resumed
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
"
when
I
was
a
younger
man
,
with
what
a
strange
compound
of
feelings
I
used
to
drink
that
toast
,
and
how
I
used
to
think
every
woman
was
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
that
before
you
were
married
?
"
<EOS>
mildly
inquired
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
certainly
,
"
replied
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
thought
so
since
;
and
a
precious
milksop
I
must
have
been
,
ever
to
have
thought
so
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
you
know
,
I
married
Fanny
under
the
oddest
,
and
most
ridiculous
circumstances
possible
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
were
they
,
if
one
may
inquire
?
"
asked
Timson
,
who
had
heard
the
story
,
on
an
average
,
twice
a
week
for
the
last
six
months
.
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
listened
attentively
,
in
the
hope
of
picking
up
some
suggestion
that
might
be
useful
to
him
in
his
new
undertaking
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
spent
my
wedding
-
night
in
a
back
-
kitchen
chimney
,
"
said
Parsons
,
by
way
of
a
beginning
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
back
-
kitchen
chimney
!
"
ejaculated
Watkins
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
dreadful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
was
n't
very
pleasant
,
"
replied
the
small
host
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
Fanny
's
father
and
mother
liked
me
well
enough
as
an
individual
,
but
had
a
decided
objection
to
my
becoming
a
husband
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
had
n't
any
money
in
those
days
,
and
they
had
;
and
so
they
wanted
Fanny
to
pick
up
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
we
managed
to
discover
the
state
of
each
other
's
affections
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
meet
her
,
at
some
mutual
friends
'
parties
;
at
first
we
danced
together
,
and
talked
,
and
flirted
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
;
then
,
I
used
to
like
nothing
so
well
as
sitting
by
her
side
---
we
did
n't
talk
so
much
then
,
but
I
remember
I
used
to
have
a
great
notion
of
looking
at
her
out
of
the
extreme
corner
of
my
left
eye
---
and
then
I
got
very
miserable
and
sentimental
,
and
began
to
write
verses
,
and
use
Macassar
oil
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
could
n't
bear
it
any
longer
,
and
after
I
had
walked
up
and
down
the
sunny
side
of
Oxford
-
street
in
tight
boots
for
a
week
---
and
a
devilish
hot
summer
<EOS>
it
was
too
---
<EOS>
in
the
hope
of
meeting
her
,
I
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
,
and
begged
her
to
manage
to
see
me
clandestinely
,
for
I
wanted
to
hear
her
decision
from
her
own
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
had
discovered
,
to
my
perfect
satisfaction
,
that
I
could
n't
live
without
her
,
and
that
if
she
did
n't
have
me
,
I
had
made
up
my
mind
to
take
prussic
acid
,
or
take
to
drinking
,
or
emigrate
,
so
as
to
take
myself
off
in
some
way
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
borrowed
a
pound
,
and
bribed
the
housemaid
to
give
her
the
note
,
which
she
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
was
the
reply
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Timson
,
who
had
found
,
before
,
that
to
encourage
the
repetition
of
old
stories
is
to
get
a
general
invitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
usual
one
!
 
<EOS>
Fanny
expressed
herself
very
miserable
;
hinted
at
the
possibility
of
an
early
grave
;
said
that
nothing
should
induce
her
to
swerve
from
the
duty
she
owed
her
parents
;
implored
me
to
forget
her
,
and
find
out
somebody
more
deserving
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
could
,
on
no
account
,
think
of
meeting
me
unknown
to
her
pa
and
ma
;
and
entreated
me
,
as
she
should
be
in
a
particular
part
of
Kensington
Gardens
at
eleven
o'clock
next
morning
,
not
to
attempt
to
meet
her
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
go
,
of
course
?
"
said
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
?
---
<EOS>
Of
course
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
There
she
was
,
with
the
identical
housemaid
in
perspective
,
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
We
walked
about
,
for
a
couple
of
hours
;
made
ourselves
delightfully
miserable
;
and
were
regularly
engaged
.
<EOS>
Then
,
we
began
to
"
correspond
"
---
that
is
to
say
,
we
used
to
exchange
about
four
letters
a
day
;
what
we
used
to
say
in
'em
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
used
to
have
an
interview
,
in
the
kitchen
,
or
the
cellar
,
or
some
such
place
,
every
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
things
went
on
in
this
way
for
some
time
;
and
we
got
fonder
of
each
other
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
as
our
love
was
raised
to
such
a
pitch
,
and
as
my
salary
had
been
raised
too
,
shortly
before
,
we
determined
on
a
secret
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
arranged
to
sleep
at
a
friend
's
,
on
the
previous
night
;
we
were
to
be
married
early
in
the
morning
;
and
then
we
were
to
return
to
her
home
and
be
pathetic
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
to
fall
at
the
old
gentleman
's
feet
,
and
bathe
his
boots
with
her
tears
;
and
I
was
to
hug
the
old
lady
and
call
her
"
mother
,
"
and
use
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
as
much
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Married
we
were
,
the
next
morning
;
two
girls
-
friends
of
Fanny
's
---
acting
as
bridesmaids
;
and
a
man
,
who
was
hired
for
five
shillings
and
a
pint
of
porter
,
officiating
as
father
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
old
lady
unfortunately
put
off
her
return
from
Ramsgate
,
where
she
had
been
paying
a
visit
,
until
the
next
morning
;
and
as
we
placed
great
reliance
on
her
,
we
agreed
to
postpone
our
confession
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
 
<EOS>
My
newly
-
made
wife
returned
home
,
and
I
spent
my
wedding
-
day
in
strolling
about
Hampstead
-
heath
,
and
execrating
my
father
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
went
to
comfort
my
dear
little
wife
at
night
,
as
much
as
I
could
,
with
the
assurance
that
our
troubles
would
soon
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
the
garden
-
gate
,
of
which
I
had
a
key
,
and
was
shown
by
the
servant
to
our
old
place
of
meeting
---
a
back
kitchen
,
with
a
stone
-
floor
and
a
dresser
:
 
upon
which
,
in
the
absence
of
chairs
,
we
used
to
sit
and
make
love
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Make
love
upon
a
kitchen
-
dresser
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
whose
ideas
of
decorum
were
greatly
outraged
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
On
a
kitchen
-
dresser
!
"
replied
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
let
me
tell
you
,
old
fellow
,
that
,
if
you
were
really
over
head
-
and
-
ears
in
love
,
and
had
no
other
place
to
make
love
in
,
you
'd
be
devilish
glad
to
avail
yourself
of
such
an
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
let
me
see
;
---
where
was
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
dresser
,
"
suggested
Timson
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
---
ah
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
here
I
found
poor
Fanny
,
quite
disconsolate
and
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
boy
had
been
very
cross
all
day
,
which
made
her
feel
still
more
lonely
;
and
she
was
quite
out
of
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
I
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
,
and
laughed
it
off
,
and
said
we
should
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
a
matrimonial
life
more
by
contrast
;
and
,
at
length
,
poor
Fanny
brightened
up
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
stopped
there
,
till
about
eleven
o'clock
,
and
,
just
as
I
was
taking
my
leave
for
the
fourteenth
time
,
the
girl
came
running
down
the
stairs
,
without
her
shoes
,
in
a
great
fright
,
to
tell
us
that
the
old
villain
---
Heaven
forgive
me
for
calling
him
so
,
for
he
is
dead
and
gone
now
!
---
<EOS>
prompted
I
suppose
by
the
prince
of
darkness
,
was
coming
down
,
to
draw
his
own
beer
for
supper
---
a
thing
he
had
not
done
before
,
for
six
months
,
to
my
certain
knowledge
;
for
the
cask
stood
in
that
very
back
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
discovered
me
there
,
explanation
would
have
been
out
of
the
question
;
for
he
was
so
outrageously
violent
,
when
at
all
excited
,
that
he
never
would
have
listened
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
The
chimney
was
a
very
wide
one
;
it
had
been
originally
built
for
an
oven
;
went
up
perpendicularly
for
a
few
feet
,
and
then
shot
backward
and
formed
a
sort
of
small
cavern
.
 
<EOS>
My
hopes
and
fortune
---
the
means
of
our
joint
existence
almost
---
were
at
stake
.
 
<EOS>
I
scrambled
in
like
a
squirrel
;
coiled
myself
up
in
this
recess
;
and
,
as
Fanny
and
the
girl
replaced
the
deal
chimney
-
board
,
I
could
see
the
light
of
the
candle
which
my
unconscious
father
-
in
-
law
carried
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
him
draw
the
beer
;
and
I
never
heard
beer
run
so
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
just
leaving
the
kitchen
,
and
I
was
preparing
to
descend
,
when
down
came
the
infernal
chimney
-
board
with
a
tremendous
crash
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
and
put
down
the
candle
and
the
jug
of
beer
on
the
dresser
;
he
was
a
nervous
old
fellow
,
and
any
unexpected
noise
annoyed
him
.
<EOS>
He
coolly
observed
that
the
fire
-
place
was
never
used
,
and
sending
the
frightened
servant
into
the
next
kitchen
for
a
hammer
and
nails
,
actually
nailed
up
the
board
,
and
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
there
was
I
,
on
my
wedding
-
night
,
in
the
light
kerseymere
trousers
,
fancy
waistcoat
,
and
blue
coat
,
that
I
had
been
married
in
in
the
morning
,
in
a
back
-
kitchen
chimney
,
the
bottom
of
which
was
nailed
up
,
and
the
top
of
which
had
been
formerly
raised
some
fifteen
feet
,
to
prevent
the
smoke
from
annoying
the
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
,
"
added
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
as
he
passed
the
bottle
,
"
there
<EOS>
I
remained
till
half
-
past
seven
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
when
the
housemaid
's
sweetheart
,
who
was
a
carpenter
,
unshelled
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
dog
had
nailed
me
up
so
securely
,
that
,
to
this
very
hour
,
I
firmly
believe
that
no
one
but
a
carpenter
could
ever
have
got
me
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
Mrs
Parsons
's
father
say
,
when
he
found
you
were
married
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Watkins
Tottle
,
who
,
although
he
never
saw
a
joke
,
was
not
satisfied
until
he
heard
a
story
to
the
very
end
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
affair
of
the
chimney
so
tickled
his
fancy
,
that
he
pardoned
us
off
-
hand
,
and
allowed
us
something
to
live
on
till
he
went
the
way
of
all
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
I
spent
the
next
night
in
his
second
-
floor
front
,
much
more
comfortably
than
I
had
spent
the
preceding
one
;
<EOS>
for
,
as
you
will
probably
guess
---
"
   
"
Please
,
sir
,
missis
has
made
tea
,
"
said
a
middle
-
aged
female
servant
,
bobbing
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
very
housemaid
that
figures
in
my
story
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
went
into
Fanny
's
service
when
we
were
first
married
,
and
has
been
with
us
ever
since
;
but
I
do
n't
think
she
has
felt
one
atom
of
respect
for
me
since
the
morning
she
saw
me
released
,
when
she
went
into
violent
hysterics
,
to
which
she
has
been
subject
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
shall
we
join
the
ladies
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
"
said
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
added
the
obsequious
Mr
Timson
;
and
the
trio
made
for
the
drawing
-
room
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
Tea
being
concluded
,
and
the
toast
and
cups
having
been
duly
handed
,
and
occasionally
upset
,
by
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
a
rubber
was
proposed
.
 
<EOS>
They
cut
for
partners
---
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Parsons
;
and
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
and
Miss
Lillerton
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Timson
having
conscientious
scruples
on
the
subject
of
card
-
playing
,
drank
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
kept
up
a
running
spar
with
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
went
off
well
;
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
was
in
high
spirits
,
having
some
reason
to
be
gratified
with
his
reception
by
Miss
Lillerton
;
and
before
he
left
,
a
small
party
was
made
up
to
visit
the
Beulah
Spa
on
the
following
Saturday
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
to
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
as
he
opened
the
garden
gate
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
he
replied
,
squeezing
his
friend
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
down
by
the
first
coach
on
Saturday
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
fortune
had
decreed
that
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
should
not
be
down
by
the
first
coach
on
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
His
adventures
on
that
day
,
however
,
and
the
success
of
his
wooing
,
are
subjects
for
another
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
Chapter
the
Second
<EOS>
"
The
first
coach
has
not
come
in
yet
,
has
it
,
Tom
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
as
he
very
complacently
paced
up
and
down
the
fourteen
feet
of
gravel
which
bordered
the
"
lawn
,
"
on
the
Saturday
morning
which
had
been
fixed
upon
for
the
Beulah
Spa
jaunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
;
I
have
n't
seen
it
,
"
replied
a
gardener
in
a
blue
apron
,
who
let
himself
out
to
do
the
ornamental
for
half
-
a
-
crown
a
day
and
his
"
keep
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Time
Tottle
was
down
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
ruminating
---
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
here
he
is
,
no
doubt
,
"
added
Gabriel
,
as
a
cab
drove
rapidly
up
the
hill
;
and
he
buttoned
his
dressing
-
gown
,
and
opened
the
gate
to
receive
the
expected
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
The
cab
stopped
,
and
out
jumped
a
man
in
a
coarse
Petersham
great
-
coat
,
whity
-
brown
neckerchief
,
faded
black
suit
,
gamboge
-
coloured
top
-
boots
,
and
one
of
those
large
-
crowned
hats
,
formerly
seldom
met
with
,
but
now
very
generally
patronised
by
gentlemen
and
costermongers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Parsons
?
"
said
the
man
,
looking
at
the
superscription
of
a
note
he
held
in
his
hand
,
and
addressing
Gabriel
with
an
inquiring
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
MY
name
is
Parsons
,
"
responded
the
sugar
-
baker
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
brought
this
here
note
,
"
replied
the
individual
in
the
painted
tops
,
in
a
hoarse
whisper
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
brought
this
here
<EOS>
note
from
a
gen'lm'n
<EOS>
as
come
to
our
house
this
mornin
'
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
expected
the
gentleman
at
my
house
,
"
said
Parsons
,
as
he
broke
the
seal
,
which
bore
the
impression
of
her
Majesty
's
profile
as
it
is
seen
on
a
sixpence
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
doubt
the
gen'lm'n
would
ha
'
been
here
,
replied
the
stranger
,
"
if
he
had
n't
happened
to
call
at
our
house
first
;
but
we
never
trusts
no
gen'lm'n
furder
nor
we
can
see
him
---
no
mistake
about
that
there
"
---
added
the
unknown
,
with
a
facetious
grin
;
"
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
<EOS>
no
offence
meant
,
only
---
once
in
,
and
I
wish
you
may
---
catch
the
idea
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
was
not
remarkable
for
catching
anything
suddenly
,
but
a
cold
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
only
bestowed
a
glance
of
profound
astonishment
on
his
mysterious
companion
,
and
proceeded
to
unfold
the
note
of
which
he
had
been
the
bearer
.
 
<EOS>
Once
opened
and
the
idea
was
caught
with
very
little
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
had
been
suddenly
arrested
for
33L.
10S.
4D.
,
and
dated
his
communication
from
a
lock
-
up
house
in
the
vicinity
of
Chancery
-
lane
.
   
<EOS>
"
Unfortunate
affair
this
!
"
said
Parsons
,
refolding
the
note
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
nothin'
<EOS>
ven
you
're
used
to
it
,
"
coolly
observed
the
man
in
the
Petersham
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
!
"
exclaimed
Parsons
,
after
a
few
minutes
'
consideration
,
"
just
put
the
horse
in
,
will
you
?
---
Tell
the
gentleman
that
I
shall
be
there
almost
as
soon
as
you
are
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
the
sheriff
-
officer
's
Mercury
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Werry
well
,
"
replied
that
important
functionary
;
adding
,
in
a
confidential
manner
,
"
I
'd
adwise
the
gen'lm'n
's
friends
to
settle
.
<EOS>
You
see
it
's
a
mere
trifle
;
and
,
unless
the
gen'lm'n
means
to
go
up
afore
the
court
,
it
's
hardly
worth
while
waiting
for
detainers
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Our
governor
's
wide
awake
,
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
never
say
nothin'
agin
him
,
nor
no
man
;
but
he
knows
what
's
o'clock
,
he
does
,
uncommon
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
delivered
this
eloquent
,
and
,
to
Parsons
,
particularly
intelligible
harangue
,
the
meaning
of
which
was
eked
out
by
divers
nods
and
winks
,
the
gentleman
in
the
boots
reseated
himself
in
the
cab
,
which
went
rapidly
off
,
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
the
pathway
for
some
minutes
,
apparently
absorbed
in
deep
meditation
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
his
cogitations
seemed
to
be
perfectly
satisfactory
to
himself
,
for
he
ran
briskly
into
the
house
;
said
that
business
had
suddenly
summoned
him
to
town
;
that
he
had
desired
the
messenger
to
inform
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
of
the
fact
;
and
that
they
would
return
together
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
hastily
equipped
himself
for
a
drive
,
and
mounting
his
gig
,
was
soon
on
his
way
to
the
establishment
of
Mr
Solomon
Jacobs
,
situate
(
as
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
had
informed
him
)
in
Cursitor
-
street
,
Chancery
-
lane
.
   
<EOS>
When
a
man
is
in
a
violent
hurry
to
get
on
,
and
has
a
specific
object
in
view
,
the
attainment
of
which
depends
on
the
completion
of
his
journey
,
the
difficulties
which
interpose
themselves
in
his
way
appear
not
only
to
be
innumerable
,
but
to
have
been
called
into
existence
especially
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
The
remark
is
by
no
means
a
new
one
,
and
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
had
practical
and
painful
experience
of
its
justice
in
the
course
of
his
drive
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
three
classes
of
animated
objects
which
prevent
your
driving
with
any
degree
of
comfort
or
celerity
through
streets
which
are
but
little
frequented
---
they
are
pigs
,
children
,
and
old
women
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
occasion
we
are
describing
,
the
pigs
were
luxuriating
on
cabbage
-
stalks
,
and
the
shuttlecocks
fluttered
from
the
little
deal
battledores
,
and
the
children
played
in
the
road
;
and
women
,
with
a
basket
in
one
hand
,
and
the
street
-
door
key
in
the
other
,
WOULD
cross
just
before
the
horse
's
head
,
until
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
was
perfectly
savage
with
vexation
,
and
quite
hoarse
with
hoi
-
ing
and
imprecating
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
he
got
into
Fleet
-
street
,
there
was
"
a
stoppage
,
"
in
which
people
in
vehicles
have
the
satisfaction
of
remaining
stationary
for
half
an
hour
,
and
envying
the
slowest
pedestrians
;
and
where
policemen
rush
about
,
and
seize
hold
of
horses
'
bridles
,
and
back
them
into
shop
-
windows
,
by
way
of
clearing
the
road
and
preventing
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
turned
into
Chancery
-
lane
,
and
having
inquired
for
,
and
been
directed
to
Cursitor
-
street
(
for
it
was
a
locality
of
which
he
was
quite
ignorant
)
,
he
soon
found
himself
opposite
the
house
of
Mr
Solomon
Jacobs
.
 
<EOS>
Confiding
his
horse
and
gig
to
the
care
of
one
of
the
fourteen
boys
who
had
followed
him
from
the
other
side
of
Blackfriars
-
bridge
on
the
chance
of
his
requiring
their
services
,
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
crossed
the
road
and
knocked
at
an
inner
door
,
the
upper
part
of
which
was
of
glass
,
grated
like
the
windows
of
this
inviting
mansion
with
iron
bars
---
painted
white
to
look
comfortable
.
   
<EOS>
The
knock
was
answered
by
a
sallow
-
faced
,
red
-
haired
,
sulky
boy
,
who
,
after
surveying
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
through
the
glass
,
applied
a
large
key
to
an
immense
wooden
excrescence
,
which
was
in
reality
a
lock
,
but
which
,
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
iron
nails
with
which
the
panels
were
studded
,
gave
the
door
the
appearance
of
being
subject
to
warts
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
"
said
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
gentleman
that
come
in
this
morning
,
Jem
,
"
screamed
a
voice
from
the
top
of
the
kitchen
-
stairs
,
which
belonged
to
a
dirty
woman
who
had
just
brought
her
chin
to
a
level
with
the
passage
-
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
's
in
the
coffee
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Up
-
stairs
,
sir
,
"
said
the
boy
,
just
opening
the
door
wide
enough
to
let
Parsons
in
without
squeezing
him
,
and
double
-
locking
it
<EOS>
the
moment
he
had
made
his
way
through
the
aperture
---
"
First
floor
---
door
on
the
left
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
thus
instructed
,
ascended
the
uncarpeted
and
ill
-
lighted
staircase
,
and
after
giving
several
subdued
taps
at
the
before
-
mentioned
"
door
on
the
left
,
"
which
were
rendered
inaudible
by
the
hum
of
voices
within
the
room
,
and
the
hissing
noise
attendant
on
some
frying
operations
which
were
carrying
on
below
stairs
,
turned
the
handle
,
and
entered
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
Being
informed
that
the
unfortunate
object
of
his
visit
had
just
gone
up
-
stairs
to
write
a
letter
,
he
had
leisure
to
sit
down
and
observe
the
scene
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
---
which
was
a
small
,
confined
den
---
was
partitioned
off
into
boxes
,
like
the
common
-
room
of
some
inferior
eating
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
dirty
floor
had
evidently
been
as
long
a
stranger
to
the
scrubbing
-
brush
as
to
carpet
or
floor
-
cloth
:
 
and
the
ceiling
was
completely
blackened
by
the
flare
of
the
oil
-
lamp
by
which
the
room
was
lighted
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
gray
ashes
on
the
edges
of
the
tables
,
and
the
cigar
ends
which
were
plentifully
scattered
about
the
dusty
grate
,
fully
accounted
for
the
intolerable
smell
of
tobacco
which
pervaded
the
place
;
and
the
empty
glasses
and
half
-
saturated
slices
of
lemon
on
the
tables
,
together
with
the
porter
pots
beneath
them
,
bore
testimony
to
the
frequent
libations
in
which
the
individuals
who
honoured
Mr
Solomon
Jacobs
by
a
temporary
residence
in
his
house
indulged
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
mantel
-
shelf
was
a
paltry
looking
-
glass
,
extending
about
half
the
width
of
the
chimney
-
piece
;
but
by
way
of
counterpoise
,
the
ashes
were
confined
by
a
rusty
fender
about
twice
as
long
as
the
hearth
.
   
<EOS>
From
this
cheerful
room
itself
,
the
attention
of
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
was
naturally
directed
to
its
inmates
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
boxes
two
men
were
playing
at
cribbage
with
a
very
dirty
pack
of
cards
,
some
with
blue
,
some
with
green
,
and
some
with
red
backs
---
selections
from
decayed
packs
.
 
<EOS>
The
cribbage
board
had
been
long
ago
formed
on
the
table
by
some
ingenious
visitor
with
the
assistance
of
a
pocket
-
knife
and
a
two
-
pronged
fork
,
with
which
the
necessary
number
of
holes
had
been
made
in
the
table
at
proper
distances
for
the
reception
of
the
wooden
pegs
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
box
a
stout
,
hearty
-
looking
man
,
of
about
forty
,
was
eating
some
dinner
which
his
wife
---
an
equally
comfortable
-
looking
personage
---
had
brought
him
in
a
basket
:
 
and
in
a
third
,
a
genteel
-
looking
young
man
was
talking
earnestly
,
and
in
a
low
tone
,
to
a
young
female
,
whose
face
was
concealed
by
a
thick
veil
,
but
whom
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
immediately
set
down
in
his
own
mind
as
the
debtor
's
wife
.
<EOS>
A
young
fellow
of
vulgar
manners
,
dressed
in
the
very
extreme
of
the
prevailing
fashion
,
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
,
with
a
lighted
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
ever
and
anon
puffing
forth
volumes
of
smoke
,
and
occasionally
applying
,
with
much
apparent
relish
,
to
a
pint
pot
,
the
contents
of
which
were
"
chilling
"
on
the
hob
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fourpence
more
,
by
gum
!
"
exclaimed
one
of
the
cribbage
-
players
,
lighting
a
pipe
,
and
addressing
his
adversary
at
the
close
of
the
game
;
"
one
'
ud
think
you
'd
got
luck
in
a
pepper
-
cruet
,
and
shook
it
out
when
you
wanted
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
that
a'n't
<EOS>
a
bad
un
,
"
replied
the
other
,
who
was
a
horse
-
dealer
from
Islington
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
I
'm
blessed
if
it
is
,
"
interposed
the
jolly
-
looking
fellow
,
who
,
having
finished
his
dinner
,
was
drinking
out
of
the
same
glass
as
his
wife
,
in
truly
conjugal
harmony
,
some
hot
gin
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
The
faithful
partner
of
his
cares
had
brought
a
plentiful
supply
of
the
anti
-
temperance
fluid
in
a
large
flat
stone
bottle
,
which
looked
like
a
half
-
gallon
jar
that
had
been
successfully
tapped
for
the
dropsy
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
rum
chap
<EOS>
,
you
are
,
Mr
Walker
---
will
you
dip
your
beak
into
this
,
sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Walker
,
leaving
his
box
,
and
advancing
to
the
other
to
accept
the
proffered
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
health
,
sir
,
and
your
good

<EOS>
Gentlemen
all

yours

and
better
luck
still

<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Willis
,
"
continued
the
facetious
prisoner
,
addressing
the
young
man
with
the
cigar
,
"
you
seem
rather
down
to
-
day
---
floored
,
as
one
may
say
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Never

you
know

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
I
'm
all
right

"
replied
the
smoker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
bailed
out
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
,
though

"
inquired
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damme
,
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
regularly
over
head
and
ears
as
the
Royal
George
,
and
stand
about
as
much
chance
of
being
BAILED
OUT

<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
stopping
short
,
and
speaking
in
a
very
loud
key
,
"
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
d'ye
think
I
've
stopped
here
two
days
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
'Cause
you
could
n't
get
out

I
suppose
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Walker
,
winking
to
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
that
you
're
exactly
obliged
to
stop
here

only
you

<EOS>
No

"
   
"
A'n't
he
a

un

"
<EOS>
inquired
the
delighted
individual
,
who
had
offered
the
gin
-
and
-
water
,
of
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
just
is
!
"
<EOS>
replied
the
lady
,
who
was
quite
overcome
by
these
flashes
of
imagination
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
case
,
"
frowned
the
victim
,
throwing
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
fire
,
and
illustrating
his
argument
by
knocking
the
bottom
of
the
pot
on
the
table
,
at
intervals
,
---
"
my
case
is
a
very
singular
one

<EOS>
My
father
's
a
man
of
large
property

I
am
his
son

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
very
strange
circumstance

"
<EOS>
interrupted
the
jocose
Mr
Walker
,
EN
PASSANT

<EOS>
"
---
I
am
his
son

<EOS>
I
do
n't
owe
no
man
nothing
---
not
the
value
of
a
farthing
,
but
I
was
induced
,
you
see
,
to
put
my
name
to
some
bills
for
a
friend
---
bills
to
a
large
amount
,
I
may
say
a
very
large
amount
,
for
which
I
did
n't
receive
no
consideration

<EOS>
What
's
the
consequence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
suppose
the
bills
went
out
,
and
you
came
in

<EOS>
The
acceptances
were
n't
taken
up

you
were

eh

"
<EOS>
inquired
Walker
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure

"
replied
the
liberally
educated
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
To

so
here

locked

"
Why

ask
your
old
governor
to
stump
up

<EOS>
inquired
Walker

with
a
somewhat
sceptical
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

bless
you
<EOS>
,
he
'd
never

it

replied
the
other
,
in
a
tone
of
expostulation

"
Never

<EOS>
"
Well

it

very
odd

sure

interposed
the
owner
of
the
flat
bottle
,
mixing
another
glass
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
've
been
in
difficulties
,
as
one
may
say
,
now
for
thirty
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
pieces
when
I
was
in
a
milk
-
walk
,
thirty
year
ago
;
arterwards
,
when
I
was
a
fruiterer
,
and
kept
a
spring
wan
;
and
arter
that
again
in
the
coal
and
"
tatur
line
---
but
all
that
time
I
never
see
a
youngish
chap
come
into
a
place
of
this
kind
,
who
was
n't
going
out
again
directly
,
and
who
had
n't
been
arrested
on
bills
which
he
'd
given
a
friend
and
for
which
he
'd
received
nothing
<EOS>
whatsomever
---
not
a
fraction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
always
the
cry
,
"
said
Walker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
see
the
use
on
it
;
that
's
what
makes
me
so
wild
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
should
have
a
much
better
opinion
of
an
individual
,
if
he
'd
say
at
once
in
an
honourable
and
gentlemanly
manner
as
he
'd
done
everybody
he
possibly
could
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
to
be
sure
,
"
interposed
the
horse
-
dealer
,
with
whose
notions
of
bargain
and
sale
the
axiom
perfectly
coincided
,
"
so
should
I.
"
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
who
had
given
rise
to
these
observations
,
was
on
the
point
of
offering
a
rather
angry
reply
to
these
sneers
,
but
the
rising
of
the
young
man
before
noticed
,
and
of
the
female
who
had
been
sitting
by
him
,
to
leave
the
room
,
interrupted
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
weeping
bitterly
,
and
the
noxious
atmosphere
of
the
room
acting
upon
her
excited
feelings
and
delicate
frame
,
rendered
the
support
of
her
companion
necessary
as
they
quitted
it
together
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
air
of
superiority
about
them
both
,
and
something
in
their
appearance
so
unusual
in
such
a
place
,
that
a
respectful
silence
was
observed
until
the
WHIRR
---
R^
---
<EOS>
BANG
of
the
spring
door
announced
that
they
were
out
of
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
broken
by
the
wife
of
the
ex
-
fruiterer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
creetur
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
quenching
a
sigh
in
a
rivulet
of
gin
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
very
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
nice
-
looking
'
ooman
too
,
"
added
the
horse
-
dealer
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
he
in
for
,
Ikey
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Walker
,
of
an
individual
who
was
spreading
a
cloth
with
numerous
blotches
of
mustard
upon
it
,
on
one
of
the
tables
,
and
whom
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
as
the
man
who
had
called
upon
him
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vy
,
"
responded
the
factotum
,
"
it
's
one
of
the
rummiest
rigs
you
ever
heard
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
in
here
last
Vensday
,
which
by
-
the
-
bye
he
's
a
-
going
over
the
water
to
-
night
---
hows'ever
<EOS>
that
's
neither
here
nor
there
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
've
been
a
going
back'ards
and
for'ards
about
his
business
,
and
ha
'
managed
to
pick
up
some
of
his
story
from
the
servants
and
them
;
and
so
far
as
I
can
make
it
out
,
it
seems
to
be
summat
to
this
here
effect
---
"
   
"
Cut
it
short
,
old
fellow
,
"
interrupted
Walker
,
who
knew
from
former
experience
that
he
of
the
top
-
boots
was
neither
very
concise
nor
intelligible
in
his
narratives
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
alone
,
"
replied
Ikey
,
"
and
I
'll
ha
'
wound
up
,
and
made
my
lucky
in
five
seconds
.
 
<EOS>
This
here
young
gen'lm'n
's
father
<EOS>
---
so
I
'm
told
,
mind
ye
---
and
the
father
o
'
<EOS>
the
young
voman
,
have
always
been
on
very
bad
,
out
-
and
-
out
,
rig'lar
knock
-
me
-
down
sort
o
'
terms
;
but
somehow
or
another
,
when
he
was
a
wisitin
'
at
some
gentlefolk
's
house
,
as
he
knowed
at
college
,
he
came
into
contract
with
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
He
seed
her
several
times
,
and
then
he
up
and
said
he
'd
keep
company
with
her
,
if
so
be
as
she
vos
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
Vell
,
she
vos
as
sweet
upon
him
as
he
vos
upon
her
,
and
so
I
s'pose
<EOS>
they
made
it
all
right
;
for
they
got
married
'bout
six
months
arterwards
,
unbeknown
,
mind
ye
,
to
the
two
fathers
<EOS>
---
leastways
<EOS>
so
I
'm
told
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
heard
on
it
---
my
eyes
,
there
was
such
a
combustion
!
 
<EOS>
Starvation
vos
the
very
least
that
vos
to
be
done
to
'em
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
gen'lm'n
's
father
cut
him
off
vith
a
bob
,
'cos
he
'd
cut
himself
off
vith
a
wife
;
and
the
young
lady
's
father
<EOS>
he
behaved
even
worser
and
more
unnat'ral
,
for
he
not
only
<EOS>
blow'd
her
up
dreadful
,
and
swore
<EOS>
he
'd
never
see
her
again
,
but
he
employed
a
chap
as
I
knows
---
and
as
you
knows
,
Mr
Valker
,
a
precious
sight
too
well
---
to
go
about
and
buy
up
the
bills
and
them
things
on
which
the
young
husband
,
thinking
his
governor
'
ud
come
round
agin
,
had
raised
the
vind
just
to
blow
himself
on
vith
for
a
time
;
besides
vich
,
he
made
all
the
interest
he
could
to
set
other
people
agin
him
.
 
<EOS>
Consequence
vos
,
that
he
paid
as
long
as
he
could
;
but
things
he
never
expected
to
have
to
meet
<EOS>
till
he
'd
had
time
to
turn
himself
round
,
come
fast
upon
him
,
and
he
vos
nabbed
.
 
<EOS>
He
vos
brought
here
,
as
I
said
afore
,
last
Vensday
,
and
I
think
there
's
about
---
ah
,
<EOS>
half
-
a
-
dozen
detainers
agin
him
down
-
stairs
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
,
"
added
Ikey
,
"
in
the
purfession
these
fifteen
year
,
and
I
never
met
vith
such
windictiveness
afore
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
creeturs
!
"
exclaimed
the
coal
-
dealer
's
wife
once
more
:
 
again
resorting
to
the
same
excellent
prescription
for
nipping
a
sigh
in
the
bud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
when
they
've
seen
as
much
trouble
as
I
and
my
old
man
here
have
,
they
'll
be
as
comfortable
under
it
as
we
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
young
lady
's
a
pretty
creature
,
"
said
Walker
,
"
<EOS>
only
she
's
a
little
too
delicate
for
my
taste
<EOS>
---
there
ai
n't
enough
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
young
cove
,
he
may
be
very
respectable
and
what
not
,
but
he
's
too
down
in
the
mouth
for
me
---
he
ai
n't
game
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Game
!
"
exclaimed
Ikey
,
who
had
been
altering
the
position
of
a
green
-
handled
knife
and
fork
at
least
a
dozen
times
,
in
order
that
he
might
remain
in
the
room
under
the
pretext
of
having
something
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
game
enough
<EOS>
ven
there
's
anything
to
be
fierce
about
;
but
who
could
be
game
as
you
call
it
,
Mr
Walker
,
with
a
pale
young
creetur
like
that
,
hanging
about
him
?
<EOS>
---
It
's
enough
to
drive
any
man
's
heart
into
his
boots
to
see
'em
together
---
and
no
mistake
at
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
her
first
comin
'
here
;
he
wrote
to
her
on
the
Thursday
to
come
---
<EOS>
I
know
he
did
,
'cos
<EOS>
I
took
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Uncommon
fidgety
he
was
all
day
to
be
sure
,
and
in
the
evening
he
goes
down
into
the
office
,
and
he
says
to
Jacobs
,
says
he
,
"
Sir
,
can
I
have
the
loan
of
a
private
room
for
a
few
minutes
this
evening
,
without
incurring
any
additional
expense
---
just
to
see
my
wife
in
?
"
says
he
.
 
<EOS>
Jacobs
looked
as
much
as
to
say
---
"
Strike
me
bountiful
if
you
ai
n't
one
of
the
modest
sort
!
"
<EOS>
but
as
the
gen'lm'n
who
had
been
in
the
back
parlour
had
just
gone
out
,
and
had
paid
for
it
for
that
day
,
he
says
---
werry
grave
---
"
Sir
,
"
says
he
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
agin
our
rules
to
let
private
rooms
to
our
lodgers
on
gratis
terms
,
but
,
"
says
he
,
"
for
a
gentleman
,
I
do
n't
mind
breaking
through
them
for
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
then
he
turns
round
to
me
,
and
says
,
"
Ikey
,
put
two
mould
candles
in
the
back
parlour
,
and
charge
'em
to
this
gen'lm'n
's
account
,
"
<EOS>
vich
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Vell
,
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
a
hackney
-
coach
comes
up
to
the
door
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
was
the
young
lady
,
wrapped
up
in
a
hopera
-
cloak
,
as
it
might
be
,
and
all
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
the
gate
that
night
,
so
<EOS>
I
went
up
when
the
coach
come
,
and
he
vos
a
waitin
'
at
the
parlour
door
---
and
was
n't
he
a
trembling
,
neither
?
 
<EOS>
The
poor
creetur
see
him
,
and
could
hardly
walk
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Harry
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
says
,
"
that
it
should
have
come
to
this
;
and
all
for
my
sake
,
"
says
she
,
putting
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
puts
his
arm
round
her
pretty
little
waist
,
and
leading
her
gently
a
little
way
into
the
room
,
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
shut
the
door
,
he
says
,
<EOS>
so
kind
and
soft
-
like
---
"
Why
,
Kate
,
"
says
he
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
gentleman
you
want
,
"
said
Ikey
,
abruptly
breaking
off
in
his
story
,
and
introducing
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
to
the
crest
-
fallen
Watkins
Tottle
,
who
at
that
moment
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Watkins
advanced
with
a
wooden
expression
of
passive
endurance
,
and
accepted
the
hand
which
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
held
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
with
a
look
strongly
expressive
of
his
dislike
of
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
way
,
"
replied
the
imprisoned
one
,
leading
the
way
to
the
front
drawing
-
room
,
where
rich
debtors
did
the
luxurious
at
the
rate
of
a
couple
of
guineas
a
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
here
I
am
,
"
said
Mr
Watkins
,
as
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
;
and
placing
the
palms
of
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
anxiously
glanced
at
his
friend
's
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
here
you
're
likely
to
be
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
coolly
,
as
he
rattled
the
money
in
his
unmentionable
pockets
,
and
looked
out
of
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
amount
with
the
costs
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Parsons
,
after
an
awkward
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
money
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nine
and
sixpence
halfpenny
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
few
seconds
,
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
disclose
the
plan
he
had
formed
;
he
was
accustomed
to
drive
hard
bargains
,
but
was
always
most
anxious
to
conceal
his
avarice
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
stopped
short
,
and
said
,
"
Tottle
,
you
owe
me
fifty
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
from
all
I
see
,
I
infer
that
you
are
likely
to
owe
it
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Though
you
have
every
disposition
to
pay
me
if
you
could
?
"
   
"
Certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
"
listen
:
 
<EOS>
here
's
my
proposition
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
way
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
Accept
it
---
<EOS>
yes
or
no
---
<EOS>
I
will
or
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
I
'll
pay
the
debt
and
costs
,
and
I
'll
lend
you
10L.
more
(
which
,
added
to
your
annuity
,
will
enable
you
to
carry
on
the
war
well
)
if
you
'll
give
me
your
note
of
hand
to
pay
me
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
within
six
months
after
you
are
married
to
Miss
Lillerton
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
---
"
   
"
Stop
a
minute
---
on
one
condition
;
and
that
is
,
that
you
propose
to
Miss
Lillerton
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
once
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Parsons
,
consider
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
you
to
consider
,
not
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
knows
you
well
from
reputation
,
though
she
did
not
know
you
personally
until
lately
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
her
maiden
modesty
,
I
think
she
'd
be
devilish
glad
to
get
married
out
of
hand
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
<EOS>
My
wife
has
sounded
her
on
the
subject
,
and
she
has
confessed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
---
what
?
"
eagerly
interrupted
the
enamoured
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
Parsons
,
"
to
say
exactly
what
she
has
confessed
,
would
be
rather
difficult
,
because
they
only
spoke
in
hints
,
and
so
forth
;
but
my
wife
,
who
is
no
bad
judge
in
these
cases
,
declared
to
me
that
what
she
had
confessed
was
as
good
as
to
say
that
she
was
not
insensible
of
your
merits
---
in
fact
,
that
no
other
man
should
have
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
rose
hastily
from
his
seat
,
and
rang
the
bell
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
for
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
send
the
man
for
the
bill
stamp
,
"
replied
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
've
made
up
your
mind
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
---
and
they
shook
hands
most
cordially
.
 
<EOS>
The
note
of
hand
was
given
---
the
debt
and
costs
were
paid
---
Ikey
was
satisfied
for
his
trouble
,
and
the
two
friends
soon
found
themselves
on
that
side
of
Mr
Solomon
Jacobs
's
establishment
,
on
which
most
of
his
visitors
were
very
happy
when
they
found
themselves
once
again
---
to
wit
,
the
OUTside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
as
they
drove
to
Norwood
together
---
<EOS>
"
you
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
make
the
disclosure
to
-
night
,
and
mind
you
speak
out
,
Tottle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
---
I
will
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Watkins
,
valorously
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
I
should
like
to
see
you
together
,
"
ejaculated
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
<EOS>
---
"
What
fun
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
laughed
so
long
and
<EOS>
so
loudly
,
that
he
disconcerted
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
and
frightened
the
horse
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
Fanny
and
your
intended
walking
about
on
the
lawn
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
as
they
approached
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mind
your
eye
,
Tottle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
"
replied
Watkins
,
resolutely
,
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
spot
where
the
ladies
were
walking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Mr
Tottle
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
addressing
Miss
Lillerton
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
turned
quickly
round
,
and
acknowledged
his
courteous
salute
with
the
same
sort
of
confusion
that
Watkins
had
noticed
on
their
first
interview
,
but
with
something
like
a
slight
expression
of
disappointment
or
carelessness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
how
glad
she
was
to
see
you
?
"
whispered
Parsons
to
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
really
thought
she
looked
as
if
she
would
rather
have
seen
somebody
else
,
"
replied
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Parsons
again
<EOS>
---
"
it
's
always
the
way
with
the
women
,
young
or
old
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
show
how
delighted
they
are
to
see
those
whose
presence
makes
their
hearts
beat
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
way
with
the
whole
sex
,
and
no
man
should
have
lived
to
your
time
of
life
without
knowing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
confessed
it
to
me
,
when
we
were
first
married
,
over
and
over
again
---
see
what
it
is
to
have
a
wife
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
"
whispered
Tottle
,
whose
courage
was
vanishing
fast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
you
'd
better
begin
to
pave
the
way
,
"
said
Parsons
,
who
,
having
invested
some
money
in
the
speculation
,
assumed
the
office
of
director
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
I
will
---
presently
,
"
replied
Tottle
,
greatly
flurried
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
something
to
her
,
man
,
"
urged
Parsons
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Confound
it
!
<EOS>
pay
her
a
compliment
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
not
till
after
dinner
,
"
replied
the
bashful
Tottle
,
anxious
to
postpone
the
evil
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
"
you
are
really
very
polite
;
you
stay
away
the
whole
morning
,
after
promising
to
take
us
out
,
and
when
you
do
come
home
,
you
stand
whispering
together
and
take
no
notice
of
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
were
talking
of
the
BUSINESS
,
my
dear
,
which
detained
us
this
morning
,
"
replied
Parsons
,
looking
significantly
at
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
how
very
quickly
the
morning
has
gone
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
referring
to
the
gold
watch
,
which
was
wound
up
on
state
occasions
,
whether
it
required
it
or
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
has
passed
very
slowly
,
"
mildly
suggested
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
(
"
That
's
right
---
bravo
!
"
)
<EOS>
whispered
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
with
an
air
of
majestic
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
impute
it
to
my
unavoidable
absence
from
your
society
,
madam
,
"
said
Watkins
,
"
and
that
of
Mrs
Parsons
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
During
this
short
dialogue
,
the
ladies
had
been
leading
the
way
to
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
deuce
did
you
stick
Fanny
into
that
last
compliment
for
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Parsons
,
as
they
followed
together
;
"
it
quite
spoilt
the
effect
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
really
would
have
been
too
broad
without
,
"
replied
Watkins
Tottle
,
"
much
too
broad
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
mad
!
"
<EOS>
Parsons
whispered
his
wife
,
as
they
entered
the
drawing
-
room
,
"
mad
from
modesty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
ejaculated
the
lady
,
"
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
we
have
quite
a
family
dinner
,
Mr
Tottle
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
when
they
sat
down
to
table
:
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lillerton
is
one
of
us
,
and
,
of
course
,
we
make
no
stranger
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
expressed
a
hope
that
the
Parsons
family
never
would
make
a
stranger
of
him
;
and
wished
internally
that
his
bashfulness
would
allow
him
to
feel
a
little
less
like
a
stranger
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
off
the
covers
,
Martha
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
directing
the
shifting
of
the
scenery
with
great
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
The
order
was
obeyed
,
and
a
pair
of
boiled
fowls
,
with
tongue
and
et
ceteras
,
were
displayed
at
the
top
,
and
a
fillet
of
veal
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
the
table
two
green
sauce
-
tureens
,
with
ladles
of
the
same
,
were
setting
to
each
other
in
a
green
dish
;
and
on
the
other
was
a
curried
rabbit
,
in
a
brown
suit
,
turned
up
with
lemon
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lillerton
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
"
shall
I
assist
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
no
;
I
think
I
'll
trouble
Mr
Tottle
.
"
   
<EOS>
Watkins
started
---
trembled
---
helped
the
rabbit
---
and
broke
a
tumbler
.
 
<EOS>
The
countenance
of
the
lady
of
the
house
,
which
had
been
all
smiles
previously
,
underwent
an
awful
change
.
   
<EOS>
"
Extremely
sorry
,
"
stammered
Watkins
,
assisting
himself
to
currie
and
parsley
and
butter
,
in
the
extremity
of
his
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
consequence
,
"
replied
Mrs
Parsons
,
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
it
was
of
the
greatest
consequence
possible
,
---
directing
aside
the
researches
of
the
boy
,
who
was
groping
under
the
table
for
the
bits
of
broken
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
presume
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
"
that
Mr
Tottle
is
aware
of
the
interest
which
bachelors
usually
pay
in
such
cases
;
a
dozen
glasses
for
one
is
the
lowest
penalty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
gave
his
friend
an
admonitory
tread
on
the
toe
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
clear
hint
that
the
sooner
he
ceased
to
be
a
bachelor
and
emancipated
himself
from
such
penalties
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
viewed
the
observation
in
the
same
light
,
and
challenged
Mrs
Parsons
to
take
wine
,
with
a
degree
of
presence
of
mind
,
which
,
under
all
the
circumstances
,
was
really
extraordinary
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lillerton
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
"
may
I
have
the
pleasure
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
most
happy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tottle
,
will
you
assist
Miss
Lillerton
,
and
pass
the
decanter
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
(
The
usual
pantomimic
ceremony
of
nodding
and
sipping
gone
through
)
---
   
<EOS>
"
Tottle
,
were
you
ever
in
Suffolk
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
master
of
the
house
,
who
was
burning
to
tell
one
of
his
seven
stock
stories
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
responded
Watkins
,
adding
,
by
way
of
a
saving
clause
,
"
but
I
've
been
in
Devonshire
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
replied
Gabriel
,
"
it
was
in
Suffolk
that
a
rather
singular
circumstance
happened
to
me
many
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
happen
to
hear
me
mention
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
HAD
happened
to
hear
his
friend
mention
it
some
four
hundred
times
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
he
expressed
great
curiosity
,
and
evinced
the
utmost
impatience
to
hear
the
story
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
forthwith
attempted
to
proceed
,
in
spite
of
the
interruptions
to
which
,
as
our
readers
must
frequently
have
observed
,
the
master
of
the
house
is
often
exposed
in
such
cases
.
<EOS>
We
will
attempt
to
give
them
an
idea
of
our
meaning
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
in
Suffolk
---
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
off
the
fowls
first
,
Martha
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
in
Suffolk
,
"
resumed
Mr
Parsons
,
with
an
impatient
glance
at
his
wife
,
who
pretended
not
to
observe
it
,
"
which
is
now
years
ago
,
business
led
me
to
the
town
of
Bury
St
Edmund
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
to
stop
at
the
principal
places
in
my
way
,
and
therefore
,
for
the
sake
of
convenience
,
I
travelled
in
a
gig
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
Sudbury
one
dark
night
---
it
was
winter
time
---
about
nine
o'clock
;
the
rain
poured
in
torrents
,
the
wind
howled
among
the
trees
that
skirted
the
roadside
,
and
I
was
obliged
to
proceed
at
a
foot
-
pace
,
for
I
could
hardly
see
my
hand
before
me
<EOS>
,
it
was
so
dark
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
John
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Parsons
,
in
a
low
,
hollow
voice
,
"
do
n't
spill
that
gravy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
said
Parsons
impatiently
,
"
I
wish
you
'd
defer
these
domestic
reproofs
to
some
more
suitable
time
.
 
<EOS>
Really
,
my
dear
,
these
constant
interruptions
are
very
annoying
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
did
n't
interrupt
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
,
you
DID
interrupt
me
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
very
absurd
you
are
,
my
love
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
give
directions
to
the
servants
;
I
am
quite
sure
that
if
I
sat
here
and
allowed
John
to
spill
the
gravy
over
the
new
carpet
,
you
'd
be
the
first
to
find
fault
when
you
saw
the
stain
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
continued
Gabriel
with
a
resigned
air
,
as
if
he
knew
there
was
no
getting
over
the
point
about
the
carpet
,
"
<EOS>
I
was
just
saying
,
it
was
so
dark
that
I
could
hardly
see
my
hand
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
road
was
very
lonely
,
and
I
assure
you
,
Tottle
(
this
was
a
device
to
arrest
the
wandering
attention
of
that
individual
,
which
was
distracted
by
a
confidential
communication
between
Mrs
Parsons
and
Martha
,
accompanied
by
the
delivery
of
a
large
bunch
of
keys
)
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
Tottle
,
I
became
somehow
impressed
with
a
sense
of
the
loneliness
of
my
situation
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pie
to
your
master
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Parsons
,
again
directing
the
servant
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
pray
,
my
dear
,
"
remonstrated
Parsons
once
more
,
very
pettishly
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
P
turned
up
her
hands
and
eyebrows
,
and
appealed
in
dumb
show
to
Miss
Lillerton
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
turned
a
corner
of
the
road
,
"
resumed
Gabriel
,
"
the
horse
stopped
short
,
and
reared
tremendously
.
 
<EOS>
I
pulled
up
,
jumped
out
,
ran
to
his
head
,
and
found
a
man
lying
on
his
back
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
dead
;
but
no
,
he
was
alive
,
and
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
the
matter
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
jumped
up
,
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
chest
,
and
fixing
upon
me
the
most
earnest
gaze
you
can
imagine
,
exclaimed
---
"
   
"
Pudding
here
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
no
use
,
"
exclaimed
the
host
,
now
rendered
desperate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Tottle
;
a
glass
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
useless
to
attempt
relating
anything
when
Mrs
Parsons
is
present
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
attack
was
received
in
the
usual
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Parsons
talked
TO
Miss
Lillerton
and
AT
her
better
half
;
expatiated
on
the
impatience
of
men
generally
;
hinted
that
her
husband
was
peculiarly
vicious
in
this
respect
,
and
wound
up
by
insinuating
that
she
must
be
one
of
the
best
tempers
that
ever
existed
,
or
she
never
could
put
up
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Really
what
she
had
to
endure
sometimes
,
was
more
than
any
one
who
saw
her
in
every
-
day
life
could
by
possibility
suppose
.
<EOS>
---
The
story
was
now
a
painful
subject
,
and
therefore
Mr
Parsons
declined
to
enter
into
any
details
,
and
contented
himself
by
stating
that
the
man
was
a
maniac
,
who
had
escaped
from
a
neighbouring
mad
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
removed
;
the
ladies
soon
afterwards
retired
,
and
Miss
Lillerton
played
the
piano
in
the
drawing
-
room
overhead
,
very
loudly
,
for
the
edification
of
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
and
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
sat
chatting
comfortably
enough
,
until
the
conclusion
of
the
second
bottle
,
when
the
latter
,
in
proposing
an
adjournment
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
informed
Watkins
that
he
had
concerted
a
plan
with
his
wife
,
for
leaving
him
and
Miss
Lillerton
alone
,
soon
after
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
Tottle
,
as
they
went
up
-
stairs
,
"
do
n't
you
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
put
it
off
till
-
till
-
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
YOU
think
it
would
have
been
much
better
if
I
had
left
you
in
that
wretched
hole
<EOS>
I
found
you
in
this
morning
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Parsons
bluntly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
---
well
---
I
only
made
a
suggestion
,
"
said
poor
Watkins
Tottle
,
with
a
deep
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
Tea
was
soon
concluded
,
and
Miss
Lillerton
,
drawing
a
small
work
-
table
on
one
side
of
the
fire
,
and
placing
a
little
wooden
frame
upon
it
,
something
like
a
miniature
clay
-
mill
without
the
horse
,
was
soon
busily
engaged
in
making
a
watch
-
guard
with
brown
silk
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Parsons
,
starting
up
with
well
-
feigned
surprise
,
"
I
've
forgotten
those
confounded
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Tottle
,
I
know
you
'll
excuse
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
Tottle
had
been
a
free
agent
,
he
would
have
allowed
no
one
to
leave
the
room
on
any
pretence
,
except
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
however
,
he
was
obliged
to
look
cheerful
when
Parsons
quitted
the
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
left
,
when
Martha
put
her
head
into
the
room
,
with
---
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
you
're
wanted
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Parsons
left
the
room
,
shut
the
door
carefully
after
her
,
and
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
was
left
alone
with
Miss
Lillerton
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
first
five
minutes
there
was
a
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
was
thinking
how
he
should
begin
,
and
Miss
Lillerton
appeared
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
The
fire
was
burning
low
;
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
stirred
it
,
and
put
some
coals
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
coughed
Miss
Lillerton
;
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
thought
the
fair
creature
had
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
thought
you
spoke
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
books
on
the
sofa
,
Mr
Tottle
,
if
you
would
like
to
look
at
them
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
after
the
lapse
of
another
five
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
returned
Watkins
;
and
then
he
added
,
with
a
courage
which
was
perfectly
astonishing
,
even
to
himself
,
"
Madam
,
that
is
Miss
Lillerton
,
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
me
!
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
letting
the
silk
drop
from
her
hands
,
and
sliding
her
chair
back
a
few
paces
.
<EOS>
---
"
Speak
---
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
you
,
madam
---
and
on
the
subject
of
the
state
of
your
affections
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
lady
hastily
rose
and
would
have
left
the
room
;
but
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
gently
detained
her
by
the
hand
,
and
holding
it
as
far
from
him
as
the
joint
length
of
their
arms
would
permit
<EOS>
,
he
thus
proceeded
:
 
"
Pray
do
not
misunderstand
me
,
or
suppose
that
I
am
led
to
address
you
,
after
so
short
an
acquaintance
,
by
any
feeling
of
my
own
merits
---
for
merits
I
have
none
which
could
give
me
a
claim
to
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
acquit
me
of
any
presumption
when
I
explain
that
I
have
been
acquainted
through
Mrs
Parsons
,
with
the
state
<EOS>
---
that
is
,
that
Mrs
Parsons
has
told
me
---
<EOS>
at
least
,
not
Mrs
Parsons
,
but
<EOS>
---
"
here
Watkins
began
to
wander
,
but
Miss
Lillerton
relieved
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
understand
,
Mr
Tottle
,
that
Mrs
Parsons
has
acquainted
you
with
my
feeling
---
my
affection
---
I
mean
my
respect
,
for
an
individual
of
the
opposite
sex
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
what
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Lillerton
,
averting
her
face
,
with
a
girlish
air
,
"
what
could
induce
YOU
to
seek
such
an
interview
as
this
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
your
object
be
?
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
promote
your
happiness
,
Mr
Tottle
?
"
   
<EOS>
Here
was
the
time
for
a
flourish
---
<EOS>
"
By
allowing
me
,
"
replied
Watkins
,
falling
bump
on
his
knees
,
and
breaking
two
brace
-
buttons
and
a
waistcoat
-
string
,
in
the
act
---
<EOS>
"
By
allowing
me
to
be
your
slave
,
your
servant
---
in
short
,
by
unreservedly
making
me
the
confidant
of
your
heart
's
feelings
---
may
I
say
for
the
promotion
of
your
own
happiness
---
<EOS>
may
I
say
,
in
order
that
you
may
become
the
wife
of
a
kind
and
affectionate
husband
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Disinterested
creature
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Miss
Lillerton
,
hiding
her
face
in
a
white
pocket
-
handkerchief
with
an
eyelet
-
hole
border
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
thought
that
if
the
lady
knew
all
,
she
might
possibly
alter
her
opinion
on
this
last
point
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
the
tip
of
her
middle
finger
ceremoniously
to
his
lips
,
and
got
off
his
knees
,
as
gracefully
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
information
was
correct
?
"
<EOS>
he
tremulously
inquired
,
when
he
was
once
more
on
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
.
"
 
<EOS>
Watkins
elevated
his
hands
,
and
looked
up
to
the
ornament
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
,
which
had
been
made
for
a
lamp
,
by
way
of
expressing
his
rapture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
situation
,
Mr
Tottle
,
"
resumed
the
lady
,
glancing
at
him
through
one
of
the
eyelet
-
holes
,
"
is
a
most
peculiar
and
delicate
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
said
Mr
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
acquaintance
has
been
of
SO
short
duration
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
a
week
,
"
assented
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
more
than
that
,
"
exclaimed
the
lady
,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
More
than
a
month
---
more
than
two
months
!
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
odd
,
this
,
"
thought
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
recollecting
Parsons
's
assurance
that
she
had
known
him
from
report
,
"
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
madam
,
pray
,
consider
.
 
<EOS>
The
longer
this
acquaintance
has
existed
,
the
less
reason
is
there
for
delay
now
.
 
<EOS>
Why
not
at
once
fix
a
period
for
gratifying
the
hopes
of
your
devoted
admirer
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
represented
to
me
again
and
again
that
this
is
the
course
I
ought
to
pursue
,
"
replied
Miss
Lillerton
,
"
but
pardon
my
feelings
of
delicacy
,
Mr
Tottle
---
pray
excuse
this
embarrassment
<EOS>
---
I
have
peculiar
ideas
on
such
subjects
,
and
I
am
quite
sure
that
I
never
could
summon
up
fortitude
enough
to
name
the
day
to
my
future
husband
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
allow
ME
to
name
it
,
"
said
Tottle
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
fix
it
myself
,
"
replied
Miss
Lillerton
,
bashfully
,
"
but
I
can
not
do
so
without
at
once
resorting
to
a
third
party
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
third
party
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Watkins
Tottle
;
"
who
the
deuce
is
that
to
be
,
I
wonder
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tottle
,
"
continued
Miss
Lillerton
,
"
you
have
made
me
a
most
disinterested
and
kind
offer
---
<EOS>
that
offer
I
accept
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
at
once
be
the
bearer
of
a
note
from
me
to
---
to
Mr
Timson
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Timson
!
"
said
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
After
what
has
passed
between
us
,
"
responded
Miss
Lillerton
,
still
averting
her
head
,
"
you
must
understand
whom
I
mean
;
Mr
Timson
,
the
---
the
---
clergyman
.
"
   
"
Mr
Timson
,
the
clergyman
!
"
ejaculated
Watkins
Tottle
,
in
a
state
of
inexpressible
beatitude
,
and
positive
wonder
at
his
own
success
.
"
<EOS>
Angel
!
 
<EOS>
Certainly
---
this
moment
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
prepare
it
immediately
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
making
for
the
door
;
"
the
events
of
this
day
have
flurried
me
so
much
,
Mr
Tottle
,
that
I
shall
not
leave
my
room
again
this
evening
;
I
will
send
you
the
note
by
the
servant
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
---
stay
,
"
cried
Watkins
Tottle
,
still
keeping
a
most
respectful
distance
from
the
lady
;
"
when
shall
we
meet
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tottle
,
"
replied
Miss
Lillerton
,
coquettishly
,
"
when
WE
are
married
,
I
can
never
see
you
too
often
,
nor
thank
you
too
much
;
"
and
she
left
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
flung
himself
into
an
arm
-
chair
,
and
indulged
in
the
most
delicious
reveries
of
future
bliss
,
in
which
the
idea
of
"
Five
hundred
pounds
per
annum
,
with
an
uncontrolled
power
of
disposing
of
it
by
her
last
will
and
testament
,
"
was
somehow
or
other
the
foremost
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gone
through
the
interview
so
well
,
and
it
had
terminated
so
admirably
,
that
he
almost
began
to
wish
he
had
expressly
stipulated
for
the
settlement
of
the
annual
five
hundred
on
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
come
in
?
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
peeping
in
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
"
replied
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
have
you
done
it
?
"
<EOS>
anxiously
inquired
Gabriel
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
done
it
!
"
said
Watkins
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
---
I
'm
going
to
the
clergyman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
well
you
have
managed
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
does
Timson
live
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
his
uncle
's
,
"
replied
Gabriel
,
"
just
round
the
lane
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
waiting
for
a
living
,
and
has
been
assisting
his
uncle
here
for
the
last
two
or
three
months
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
well
you
have
done
it
<EOS>
---
I
did
n't
think
you
could
have
carried
it
off
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
was
proceeding
to
demonstrate
that
the
Richardsonian
principle
was
the
best
on
which
love
could
possibly
be
made
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
Martha
,
with
a
little
pink
note
folded
like
a
fancy
cocked
-
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lillerton
's
compliments
,
"
said
Martha
,
as
she
delivered
it
into
Tottle
's
hands
,
and
vanished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
observe
the
delicacy
?
"
said
Tottle
,
appealing
to
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
COMPLIMENTS
,
not
LOVE
,
by
the
servant
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
did
n't
exactly
know
what
reply
to
make
,
so
he
poked
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
between
the
third
and
fourth
ribs
of
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
Watkins
,
when
the
explosion
of
mirth
,
consequent
on
this
practical
jest
,
had
subsided
,
"
we
'll
be
off
at
once
---
<EOS>
let
's
lose
no
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
!
"
echoed
Gabriel
Parsons
;
and
in
five
minutes
they
were
at
the
garden
-
gate
of
the
villa
tenanted
by
the
uncle
of
Mr
Timson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Charles
Timson
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
of
Mr
Charles
Timson
's
uncle
's
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Charles
IS
at
home
,
"
replied
the
man
,
stammering
;
"
but
he
desired
me
to
say
he
could
n't
be
interrupted
,
sir
,
by
any
of
the
parishioners
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
parishioner
,
"
replied
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Charles
writing
a
sermon
,
Tom
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Parsons
,
thrusting
himself
forward
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Mr
Parsons
,
sir
;
he
's
not
exactly
writing
a
sermon
,
but
he
is
practising
the
violoncello
in
his
own
bedroom
,
and
gave
strict
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
I
'm
here
,
"
replied
Gabriel
,
leading
the
way
across
the
garden
;
"
Mr
Parsons
and
Mr
Tottle
,
on
private
and
particular
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
shown
into
the
parlour
,
and
the
servant
departed
to
deliver
his
message
.
 
<EOS>
The
distant
groaning
of
the
violoncello
ceased
;
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
;
and
Mr
Timson
presented
himself
,
and
shook
hands
with
Parsons
with
the
utmost
cordiality
.
   
<EOS>
"
Game
!
"
exclaimed
Ikey
,
who
had
been
altering
the
position
of
a
green
-
handled
knife
and
fork
at
least
a
dozen
times
,
in
order
that
he
might
remain
in
the
room
under
the
pretext
of
having
something
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
game
enough
<EOS>
ven
there
's
anything
to
be
fierce
about
;
but
who
could
be
game
as
you
call
it
,
Mr
Walker
,
with
a
pale
young
creetur
like
that
,
hanging
about
him
?
<EOS>
---
It
's
enough
to
drive
any
man
's
heart
into
his
boots
to
see
'em
together
-
and
no
mistake
at
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
her
first
comin
'
here
;
he
wrote
to
her
on
the
Thursday
to
come
---
<EOS>
I
know
he
did
,
'cos
<EOS>
I
took
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Uncommon
fidgety
he
was
all
day
to
be
sure
,
and
in
the
evening
he
goes
down
into
the
office
,
and
he
says
to
Jacobs
,
says
he
,
"
Sir
,
can
I
have
the
loan
of
a
private
room
for
a
few
minutes
this
evening
,
without
incurring
any
additional
expense
---
just
to
see
my
wife
in
?
"
says
he
.
 
<EOS>
Jacobs
looked
as
much
as
to
say
---
"
Strike
me
bountiful
if
you
ai
n't
one
of
the
modest
sort
!
"
<EOS>
but
as
the
gen'lm'n
who
had
been
in
the
back
parlour
had
just
gone
out
,
and
had
paid
for
it
for
that
day
,
he
says
---
werry
grave
---
"
Sir
,
"
says
he
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
agin
our
rules
to
let
private
rooms
to
our
lodgers
on
gratis
terms
,
but
,
"
says
he
,
"
for
a
gentleman
,
I
do
n't
mind
breaking
through
them
for
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
then
he
turns
found
to
me
,
and
says
,
"
Ikey
,
put
two
mould
candles
in
the
back
parlour
,
and
charge
'em
to
this
gen'lm'n
's
account
,
"
vich
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Vell
,
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
a
hackney
-
coach
comes
up
to
the
door
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
was
the
young
lady
,
wrapped
up
in
a
hopera
-
cloak
,
as
it
might
be
,
and
all
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
the
gate
that
night
,
so
<EOS>
I
went
up
when
the
coach
come
,
and
he
vos
a
waitin
'
at
the
parlour
door
---
and
was
n't
he
a
trembling
,
neither
?
 
<EOS>
The
poor
creetur
see
him
,
and
could
hardly
walk
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Harry
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
says
,
"
that
it
should
have
come
to
this
;
and
all
for
my
sake
,
"
says
she
,
putting
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
puts
his
arm
round
her
pretty
little
waist
,
and
leading
her
gently
a
little
way
into
the
room
,
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
shut
the
door
,
he
says
,
<EOS>
so
kind
and
soft
-
like
---
"
Why
,
Kate
,
"
says
he
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
gentleman
you
want
,
"
said
Ikey
,
abruptly
breaking
off
in
his
story
,
and
introducing
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
to
the
crest
-
fallen
Watkins
Tottle
,
who
at
that
moment
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Watkins
advanced
with
a
wooden
expression
of
passive
endurance
,
and
accepted
the
hand
which
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
held
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
with
a
look
strongly
expressive
of
his
dislike
of
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
way
,
"
replied
the
imprisoned
one
,
leading
the
way
to
the
front
drawing
-
room
,
where
rich
debtors
did
the
luxurious
at
the
rate
of
a
couple
of
guineas
a
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
here
I
am
,
"
said
Mr
Watkins
,
as
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
;
and
placing
the
palms
of
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
anxiously
glanced
at
his
friend
's
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
here
you
're
likely
to
be
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
coolly
,
as
he
rattled
the
money
in
his
unmentionable
pockets
,
and
looked
out
of
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
amount
with
the
costs
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Parsons
,
after
an
awkward
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
money
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nine
and
sixpence
halfpenny
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
few
seconds
,
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
disclose
the
plan
he
had
formed
;
he
was
accustomed
to
drive
hard
bargains
,
but
was
always
most
anxious
to
conceal
his
avarice
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
stopped
short
,
and
said
,
"
Tottle
,
you
owe
me
fifty
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
from
all
I
see
,
I
infer
that
you
are
likely
to
owe
it
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Though
you
have
every
disposition
to
pay
me
if
you
could
?
"
   
"
Certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
"
listen
:
 
<EOS>
here
's
my
proposition
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
way
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
Accept
it
---
<EOS>
yes
or
no
---
<EOS>
I
will
or
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
I
'll
pay
the
debt
and
costs
,
and
I
'll
lend
you
10L.
more
(
which
,
added
to
your
annuity
,
will
enable
you
to
carry
on
the
war
well
)
if
you
'll
give
me
your
note
of
hand
to
pay
me
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
within
six
months
after
you
are
married
to
Miss
Lillerton
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
---
"
   
"
Stop
a
minute
---
on
one
condition
;
and
that
is
,
that
you
propose
to
Miss
Lillerton
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
once
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Parsons
,
consider
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
you
to
consider
,
not
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
knows
you
well
from
reputation
,
though
she
did
not
know
you
personally
until
lately
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
her
maiden
modesty
,
I
think
she
'd
be
devilish
glad
to
get
married
out
of
hand
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
<EOS>
My
wife
has
sounded
her
on
the
subject
,
and
she
has
confessed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
---
what
?
"
eagerly
interrupted
the
enamoured
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
Parsons
,
"
to
say
exactly
what
she
has
confessed
,
would
be
rather
difficult
,
because
they
only
spoke
in
hints
,
and
so
forth
;
but
my
wife
,
who
is
no
bad
judge
in
these
cases
,
declared
to
me
that
what
she
had
confessed
was
as
good
as
to
say
that
she
was
not
insensible
of
your
merits
---
in
fact
,
that
no
other
man
should
have
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
rose
hastily
from
his
seat
,
and
rang
the
bell
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
for
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
send
the
man
for
the
bill
stamp
,
"
replied
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
've
made
up
your
mind
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
---
and
they
shook
hands
most
cordially
.
 
<EOS>
The
note
of
hand
was
given
---
the
debt
and
costs
were
paid
---
Ikey
was
satisfied
for
his
trouble
,
and
the
two
friends
soon
found
themselves
on
that
side
of
Mr
Solomon
Jacobs
's
establishment
,
on
which
most
of
his
visitors
were
very
happy
when
they
found
themselves
once
again
---
to
wit
,
the
outside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
as
they
drove
to
Norwood
together
---
<EOS>
"
you
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
make
the
disclosure
to
-
night
,
and
mind
you
speak
out
,
Tottle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
---
I
will
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Watkins
,
valorously
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
I
should
like
to
see
you
together
,
"
ejaculated
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
<EOS>
---
"
What
fun
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
laughed
so
long
and
<EOS>
so
loudly
,
that
he
disconcerted
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
,
and
frightened
the
horse
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
Fanny
and
your
intended
walking
about
on
the
lawn
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
as
they
approached
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mind
your
eye
,
Tottle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
"
replied
Watkins
,
resolutely
,
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
spot
where
the
ladies
were
walking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Mr
Tottle
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
addressing
Miss
Lillerton
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
turned
quickly
round
,
and
acknowledged
his
courteous
salute
with
the
same
sort
of
confusion
that
Watkins
had
noticed
on
their
first
interview
,
but
with
something
like
a
slight
expression
of
disappointment
or
carelessness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
how
glad
she
was
to
see
you
?
"
whispered
Parsons
to
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
really
thought
she
looked
as
if
she
would
rather
have
seen
somebody
else
,
"
replied
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Parsons
again
<EOS>
---
"
it
's
always
the
way
with
the
women
,
young
or
old
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
show
how
delighted
they
are
to
see
those
whose
presence
makes
their
hearts
beat
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
way
with
the
whole
sex
,
and
no
man
should
have
lived
to
your
time
of
life
without
knowing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
confessed
it
to
me
,
when
we
were
first
married
,
over
and
over
again
---
see
what
it
is
to
have
a
wife
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
"
whispered
Tottle
,
whose
courage
was
vanishing
fast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
you
'd
better
begin
to
pave
the
way
,
"
said
Parsons
,
who
,
having
invested
some
money
in
the
speculation
,
assumed
the
office
of
director
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
I
will
---
presently
,
"
replied
Tottle
,
greatly
flurried
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
something
to
her
,
man
,
"
urged
Parsons
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Confound
it
!
<EOS>
pay
her
a
compliment
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
not
till
after
dinner
,
"
replied
the
bashful
Tottle
,
anxious
to
postpone
the
evil
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
"
you
are
really
very
polite
;
you
stay
away
the
whole
morning
,
after
promising
to
take
us
out
,
and
when
you
do
come
home
,
you
stand
whispering
together
and
take
no
notice
of
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
were
talking
of
the
BUSINESS
,
my
dear
,
which
detained
us
this
morning
,
"
replied
Parsons
,
looking
significantly
at
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
how
very
quickly
the
morning
has
gone
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
referring
to
the
gold
watch
,
which
was
wound
up
on
state
occasions
,
whether
it
required
it
or
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
has
passed
very
slowly
,
"
mildly
suggested
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
(
"
That
's
right
---
bravo
!
"
)
<EOS>
whispered
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
with
an
air
of
majestic
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
impute
it
to
my
unavoidable
absence
from
your
society
,
madam
,
"
said
Watkins
,
"
and
that
of
Mrs
Parsons
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
During
this
short
dialogue
,
the
ladies
had
been
leading
the
way
to
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
deuce
did
you
stick
Fanny
into
that
last
compliment
for
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Parsons
,
as
they
followed
together
;
"
it
quite
spoilt
the
effect
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
really
would
have
been
too
broad
without
,
"
replied
Watkins
Tottle
,
"
much
too
broad
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
mad
!
"
<EOS>
Parsons
whispered
his
wife
,
as
they
entered
the
drawing
-
room
,
"
mad
from
modesty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
ejaculated
the
lady
,
"
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
we
have
quite
a
family
dinner
,
Mr
Tottle
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
when
they
sat
down
to
table
:
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lillerton
is
one
of
us
,
and
,
of
course
,
we
make
no
stranger
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
expressed
a
hope
that
the
Parsons
family
never
would
make
a
stranger
of
him
;
and
wished
internally
that
his
bashfulness
would
allow
him
to
feel
a
little
less
like
a
stranger
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
off
the
covers
,
Martha
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
directing
the
shifting
of
the
scenery
with
great
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
The
order
was
obeyed
,
and
a
pair
of
boiled
fowls
,
with
tongue
and
et
ceteras
,
were
displayed
at
the
top
,
and
a
fillet
of
veal
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
the
table
two
green
sauce
-
tureens
,
with
ladles
of
the
same
,
were
setting
to
each
other
in
a
green
dish
;
and
on
the
other
was
a
curried
rabbit
,
in
a
brown
suit
,
turned
up
with
lemon
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lillerton
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
,
"
shall
I
assist
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
no
;
I
think
I
'll
trouble
Mr
Tottle
.
"
   
<EOS>
Watkins
started
---
trembled
---
helped
the
rabbit
---
and
broke
a
tumbler
.
 
<EOS>
The
countenance
of
the
lady
of
the
house
,
which
had
been
all
smiles
previously
,
underwent
an
awful
change
.
   
<EOS>
"
Extremely
sorry
,
"
stammered
Watkins
,
assisting
himself
to
currie
and
parsley
and
butter
,
in
the
extremity
of
his
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
consequence
,
"
replied
Mrs
Parsons
,
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
it
was
of
the
greatest
consequence
possible
,
---
directing
aside
the
researches
of
the
boy
,
who
was
groping
under
the
table
for
the
bits
of
broken
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
presume
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
"
that
Mr
Tottle
is
aware
of
the
interest
which
bachelors
usually
pay
in
such
cases
;
a
dozen
glasses
for
one
is
the
lowest
penalty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
gave
his
friend
an
admonitory
tread
on
the
toe
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
clear
hint
that
the
sooner
he
ceased
to
be
a
bachelor
and-'emancipated
himself
from
such
penalties
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
viewed
the
observation
in
the
same
light
,
and
challenged
Mrs
Parsons
to
take
wine
,
with
a
degree
of
presence
of
mind
,
which
,
under
all
the
circumstances
,
was
really
extraordinary
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lillerton
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
"
may
I
have
the
pleasure
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
most
happy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tottle
,
will
you

The
usual
pantomimic
ceremony
of
nodding
and
sipping

<EOS>
"
Tottle
,
were
you
ever
in
Suffolk
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
master
of
the
house
,
who
was
burning
to
tell
one
of
his
seven
stock
stories
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
responded
Watkins
,
adding
,
by
way
of
a
saving
clause
,
"
but
I
've
been
in
Devonshire
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
replied
Gabriel
,
"
it
was
in
Suffolk
that
a
rather
singular
circumstance
happened
to
me
many
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
happen
to
hear
me
mention
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
HAD
happened
to
hear
his
friend
mention
it
some
four
hundred
times
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
he
expressed
great
curiosity
,
and
evinced
the
utmost
impatience
to
hear
the
story
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
forthwith
attempted
to
proceed
,
in
spite
of
the
interruptions
to
which
,
as
our
readers
must
frequently
have
observed
,
the
master
of
the
house
is
often
exposed
in
such
cases
.
<EOS>
We
will
attempt
to
give
them
an
idea
of
our
meaning
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
in
Suffolk
---
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
off
the
fowls
first
,
Martha
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
in
Suffolk
,
"
resumed
Mr
Parsons
,
with
an
impatient
glance
at
his
wife
,
who
pretended
not
to
observe
it
,
"
which
is
now
years
ago
,
business
led
me
to
the
town
of
Bury
St
Edmund
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
to
stop
at
the
principal
places
in
my
way
,
and
therefore
,
for
the
sake
of
convenience
,
I
travelled
in
a
gig
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
Sudbury
one
dark
night
---
it
was
winter
time
---
about
nine
o'clock
;
the
rain
poured
in
torrents
,
the
wind
howled
among
the
trees
that
skirted
the
roadside
,
and
I
was
obliged
to
proceed
at
a
foot
-
pace
,
for
I
could
hardly
see
my
hand
before
me
<EOS>
,
it
was
so
dark
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
John
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Parsons
,
in
a
low
,
hollow
voice
,
"
do
n't
spill
that
gravy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fanny
,
"
said
Parsons
impatiently
,
"
I
wish
you
'd
defer
these
domestic
reproofs
to
some
more
suitable
time
.
 
<EOS>
Really
,
my
dear
,
these
constant
interruptions
are
very
annoying
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
did
n't
interrupt
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
,
you
did
interrupt
me
,
"
remonstrated
Mr
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
very
absurd
you
are
,
my
love
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
give
directions
to
the
servants
;
I
am
quite
sure
that
if
I
sat
here
and
allowed
John
to
spill
the
gravy
over
the
new
carpet
,
you
'd
be
the
first
to
find
fault
when
you
saw
the
stain
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
continued
Gabriel
with
a
resigned
air
,
as
if
he
knew
there
was
no
getting
over
the
point
about
the
carpet
,
"
<EOS>
I
was
just
saying
,
it
was
so
dark
that
I
could
hardly
see
my
hand
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
road
was
very
lonely
,
and
I
assure
you
,
Tottle
(
this
was
a
device
to
arrest
the
wandering
attention
of
that
individual
,
which
was
distracted
by
a
confidential
communication
between
Mrs
Parsons
and
Martha
,
accompanied
by
the
delivery
of
a
large
bunch
of
keys
)
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
Tottle
,
I
became
somehow
impressed
with
a
sense
of
the
loneliness
of
my
situation
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pie
to
your
master
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Parsons
,
again
directing
the
servant
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
pray
,
my
dear
,
"
remonstrated
Parsons
once
more
,
very
pettishly
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
P
turned
up
her
hands
and
eyebrows
,
and
appealed
in
dumb
show
to
Miss
Lillerton
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
turned
a
corner
of
the
road
,
"
resumed
Gabriel
,
"
the
horse
stopped
short
,
and
reared
tremendously
.
 
<EOS>
I
pulled
up
,
jumped
out
,
ran
to
his
head
,
and
found
a
man
lying
on
his
back
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
dead
;
but
no
,
he
was
alive
,
and
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
the
matter
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
jumped
up
,
and
potting
his
hand
to
his
chest
,
and
fixing
upon
me
the
most
earnest
gaze
you
can
imagine
,
exclaimed
---
"
Pudding
here
,
"
said
Mrs
Parsons
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
no
use
,
"
exclaimed
the
host
,
now
rendered
desperate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Tottle
;
a
glass
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
useless
to
attempt
relating
anything
when
Mrs
Parsons
is
present
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
attack
was
received
in
the
usual
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Parsons
talked
TO
Miss
Lillerton
and
AT
her
better
half
;
expatiated
on
the
impatience
of
men
generally
;
hinted
that
her
husband
was
peculiarly
vicious
in
this
respect
,
and
wound
up
by
insinuating
that
she
must
be
one
of
the
best
tempers
that
ever
existed
,
or
she
never
could
put
up
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Really
what
she
had
to
endure
sometimes
,
was
more
than
any
one
who
saw
her
in
every
-
day
life
could
by
possibility
suppose
.
<EOS>
---
The
story
was
now
a
painful
subject
,
and
therefore
Mr
Parsons
declined
to
enter
into
any
details
,
and
contented
himself
by
stating
that
the
man
was
a
maniac
,
who
had
escaped
from
a
neighbouring
mad
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
removed
;
the
ladies
soon
afterwards
retired
,
and
Miss
Lillerton
played
the
piano
in
the
drawing
-
room
overhead
,
very
loudly
,
for
the
edification
of
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
and
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
sat
chatting
comfortably
enough
,
until
the
conclusion
of
the
second
bottle
,
when
the
latter
,
in
proposing
an
adjournment
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
informed
Watkins
that
he
had
concerted
a
plan
with
his
wife
,
for
leaving
him
and
Miss
Lillerton
alone
,
soon
after
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
Tottle
,
as
they
went
up
-
stairs
,
"
do
n't
you
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
put
it
off
till
-
till
-
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
YOU
think
it
would
have
been
much
better
if
I
had
left
you
in
that
wretched
hole
<EOS>
I
found
you
in
this
morning
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Parsons
bluntly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
---
well
---
I
only
made
a
suggestion
,
"
said
poor
Watkins
Tottle
,
with
a
deep
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
Tea
was
soon
concluded
,
and
Miss
Lillerton
,
drawing
a
small
work
-
table
on
one
side
of
the
fire
,
and
placing
a
little
wooden
frame
upon
it
,
something
like
a
miniature
clay
-
mill
without
the
horse
,
was
soon
busily
engaged
in
making
a
watch
-
guard
with
brown
silk
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Parsons
,
starting
up
with
well
-
feigned
surprise
,
"
I
've
forgotten
those
confounded
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Tottle
,
I
know
you
'll
excuse
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
Tottle
had
been
a
free
agent
,
he
would
have
allowed
no
one
to
leave
the
room
on
any
pretence
,
except
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
however
,
he
was
obliged
to
look
cheerful
when
Parsons
quitted
the
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
left
,
when
Martha
put
her
head
into
the
room
,
with
---
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
you
're
wanted
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Parsons
left
the
room
,
shut
the
door
carefully
after
her
,
and
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
was
left
alone
with
Miss
Lillerton
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
first
five
minutes
there
was
a
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
was
thinking
how
he
should
begin
,
and
Miss
Lillerton
appeared
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
The
fire
was
burning
low
;
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
stirred
it
,
and
put
some
coals
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
coughed
Miss
Lillerton
;
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
thought
the
fair
creature
had
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
thought
you
spoke
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
books
on
the
sofa
,
Mr
Tottle
,
if
you
would
like
to
look
at
them
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
after
the
lapse
of
another
five
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
returned
Watkins
;
and
then
he
added
,
with
a
courage
which
was
perfectly
astonishing
,
even
to
himself
,
"
Madam
,
that
is
Miss
Lillerton
,
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
me
!
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
letting
the
silk
drop
from
her
hands
,
and
sliding
her
chair
back
a
few
paces
.
<EOS>
---
"
Speak
---
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
you
,
madam
---
and
on
the
subject
of
the
state
of
your
affections
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
lady
hastily
rose
and
would
have
left
the
room
;
but
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
gently
detained
her
by
the
hand
,
and
holding
it
as
far
from
him
as
the
joint
length
of
their
arms
would
permit
<EOS>
,
he
thus
proceeded
:
 
"
Pray
do
not
misunderstand
me
,
or
suppose
that
I
am
led
to
address
you
,
after
so
short
an
acquaintance
,
by
any
feeling
of
my
own
merits
---
for
merits
I
have
none
which
could
give
me
a
claim
to
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
acquit
me
of
any
presumption
when
I
explain
that
I
have
been
acquainted
through
Mrs
Parsons
,
with
the
state
<EOS>
---
that
is
,
that
Mrs
Parsons
has
told
me
---
<EOS>
at
least
,
not
Mrs
Parsons
,
but
<EOS>
---
"
here
Watkins
began
to
wander
,
but
Miss
Lillerton
relieved
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
understand
,
Mr
Tottle
,
that
Mrs
Parsons
has
acquainted
you
with
my
feeling
---
my
affection
---
I
mean
my
respect
,
for
an
individual
of
the
opposite
sex
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
what
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Lillerton
,
averting
her
face
,
with
a
girlish
air
,
"
what
could
induce
YOU
to
seek
such
an
interview
as
this
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
your
object
be
?
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
promote
your
happiness
,
Mr
Tottle
?
"
   
<EOS>
Here
was
the
time
for
a
flourish
---
<EOS>
"
By
allowing
me
,
"
replied
Watkins
,
falling
bump
on
his
knees
,
and
breaking
two
brace
-
buttons
and
a
waistcoat
-
string
,
in
the
act
---
<EOS>
"
By
allowing
me
to
be
your
slave
,
your
servant
---
in
short
,
by
unreservedly
making
me
the
confidant
of
your
heart
's
feelings
---
may
I
say
for
the
promotion
of
your
own
happiness
---
<EOS>
may
I
say
,
in
order
that
you
may
become
the
wife
of
a
kind
and
affectionate
husband
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Disinterested
creature
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Miss
Lillerton
,
hiding
her
face
in
a
white
pocket
-
handkerchief
with
an
eyelet
-
hole
border
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
thought
that
if
the
lady
knew
all
,
she
might
possibly
alter
her
opinion
on
this
last
point
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
the
tip
of
her
middle
finger
ceremoniously
to
his
lips
,
and
got
off
his
knees
,
as
gracefully
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
information
was
correct
?
"
<EOS>
he
tremulously
inquired
,
when
he
was
once
more
on
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
.
"
 
<EOS>
Watkins
elevated
his
hands
,
and
looked
up
to
the
ornament
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
,
which
had
been
made
for
a
lamp
,
by
way
of
expressing
his
rapture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
situation
,
Mr
Tottle
,
"
resumed
the
lady
,
glancing
at
him
through
one
of
the
eyelet
-
holes
,
"
is
a
most
peculiar
.
<EOS>
and
delicate
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
said
Mr
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
acquaintance
has
been
of
SO
short
duration
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
a
week
,
"
assented
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
more
than
that
,
"
exclaimed
the
lady
,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
More
than
a
month
---
more
than
two
months
!
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
odd
,
this
,
"
thought
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
recollecting
Parsons
's
assurance
that
she
had
known
him
from
report
,
"
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
madam
,
pray
,
consider
.
 
<EOS>
The
longer
this
acquaintance
has
existed
,
the
less
reason
is
I
there
for
delay
now
.
 
<EOS>
Why
not
at
once
fix
a
period
for
gratifying
the
hopes
of
your
devoted
admirer
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
represented
to
me
again
and
again
that
this
is
the
course
I
ought
to
pursue
,
"
replied
Miss
Lillerton
,
"
but
pardon
my
feelings
of
delicacy
,
Mr
Tottle
---
pray
excuse
this
embarrassment
<EOS>
---
I
have
peculiar
ideas
on
such
subjects
,
and
I
am
quite
sure
that
I
never
could
summon
up
fortitude
enough
to
name
the
day
to
my
future
husband
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
allow
ME
to
name
it
,
"
said
Tottle
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
fix
it
myself
,
"
replied
Miss
Lillerton
,
bashfully
,
but
I
can
not
do
so
without
at
once
resorting
to
a
third
party
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
third
party
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Watkins
Tottle
;
"
who
the
deuce
is
that
to
be
,
I
wonder
!

<EOS>
"
Mr
Tottle

continued
Miss
Lillerton
,
"
you
have
made
me
a
most
disinterested
and
kind
offer
---
<EOS>
that
offer
I
accept
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
at
once
be
the
bearer
of
a
note
from
me
to
---
to
Mr
Timson
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Timson
!
"
said
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
After
what
has
passed
between
us
,
"
responded
Miss
Lillerton
,
still
averting
her
head
,
"
you
must
understand
whom
I
mean
;
Mr
Timson
,
the
---
the
---
clergyman
.
"
   
"
Mr
Timson
,
the
clergyman
!
"
ejaculated
Watkins
Tottle
,
in
a
state
of
inexpressible
beatitude
,
and
positive
wonder
at
his
own
success
.
"
<EOS>
Angel
!
 
<EOS>
Certainly
---
this
moment
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
prepare
it
immediately
,
"
said
Miss
Lillerton
,
making
for
the
door
;
"
the
events
of
this
day
have
flurried
me
so
much
,
Mr
Tottle
,
that
I
shall
not
leave
my
room
again
this
evening
;
I
will
send
you
the
note
by
the
servant
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
---
stay
,
"
cried
Watkins
Tottle
,
still
keeping
a
most
respectful
distance
from
the
lady
;
"
when
shall
we
meet
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tottle
,
"
replied
Miss
Lillerton
,
coquettishly
,
"
when
we
are
married
,
I
can
never
see
you
too
often
,
nor
thank
you
too
much
;
"
and
she
left
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
flung
himself
into
an
arm
-
chair
,
and
indulged
in
the
most
delicious
reveries
of
future
bliss
,
in
which
the
idea
of
"
Five
hundred
pounds
per
annum
,
with
an
uncontrolled
power
of
disposing
of
it
by
her
last
will
and
testament
,
"
was
somehow
or
other
the
foremost
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gone
through
the
interview
so
well
,
and
it
had
terminated
so
admirably
,
that
he
almost
began
to
wish
he
had
expressly
stipulated
for
the
settlement
of
the
annual
five
hundred
on
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
come
in
?
"
said
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
,
peeping
in
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
"
replied
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
have
you
done
it
?
"
<EOS>
anxiously
inquired
Gabriel
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
done
it
!
"
said
Watkins
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
---
I
'm
going
to
the
clergyman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
well
you
have
managed
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
does
Timson
live
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
his
uncle
's
,
"
replied
Gabriel
,
"
just
round
the
lane
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
waiting
for
a
living
,
and
has
been
assisting
his
uncle
here
for
the
last
two
or
three
months
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
well
you
have
done
it
<EOS>
---
I
did
n't
think
you
could
have
carried
it
off
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
was
proceeding
to
demonstrate
that
the
Richardsonian
principle
was
the
best
on
which
love
could
possibly
be
made
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
Martha
,
with
a
little
pink
note
folded
like
a
fancy
cocked
-
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lillerton
's
compliments
,
"
said
Martha
,
as
she
delivered
it
into
Tottle
's
hands
,
and
vanished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
observe
the
delicacy
?
"
said
Tottle
,
appealing
to
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
COMPLIMENTS
,
not
LOVE
,
by
the
servant
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
did
n't
exactly
know
what
reply
to
make
,
so
he
poked
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
between
the
third
and
fourth
ribs
of
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
Watkins
,
when
the
explosion
of
mirth
,
consequent
on
this
practical
jest
,
had
subsided
,
"
we
'll
be
off
at
once
---
<EOS>
let
's
lose
no
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
!
"
echoed
Gabriel
Parsons
;
and
in
five
minutes
they
were
at
the
garden
-
gate
of
the
villa
tenanted
by
the
uncle
of
Mr
Timson
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Charles
Timson
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
of
Mr
Charles
Timson
's
uncle
's
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Charles
IS
at
home
,
"
replied
the
man
,
stammering
;
"
but
he
desired
me
to
say
he
could
n't
be
interrupted
,
sir
,
by
any
of
the
parishioners
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
parishioner
,
"
replied
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Charles
writing
a
sermon
,
Tom
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Parsons
,
thrusting
himself
forward
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Mr
Parsons
,
sir
;
he
's
not
exactly
writing
a
sermon
,
but
he
is
practising
the
violoncello
in
his
own
bedroom
,
and
gave
strict
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
I
'm
here
,
"
replied
Gabriel
,
leading
the
way
across
the
garden
;
"
Mr
Parsons
and
Mr
Tottle
,
on
private
and
particular
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
shown
into
the
parlour
,
and
the
servant
departed
to
deliver
his
message
.
 
<EOS>
The
distant
groaning
of
the
violoncello
ceased
;
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
;
and
Mr
Timson
presented
himself
,
and
shook
hands
with
Parsons
with
the
utmost
cordiality
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
sir
?
"
said
Watkins
Tottle
,
with
great
solemnity
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
YOU
do
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Timson
,
with
as
much
coldness
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
him
how
he
did
,
as
it
very
likely
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
deliver
this
note
to
you
,
"
said
Watkins
Tottle
,
producing
the
cocked
-
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
Miss
Lillerton
!
"
said
Timson
,
suddenly
changing
colour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
sat
down
;
and
while
Timson
perused
the
note
,
fixed
his
eyes
on
an
oyster
-
sauce
-
coloured
portrait
of
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
which
hung
over
the
fireplace
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Timson
rose
from
his
seat
when
he
had
concluded
the
note
,
and
looked
dubiously
at
Parsons
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
"
he
inquired
,
appealing
to
Watkins
Tottle
,
"
whether
our
friend
here
is
acquainted
with
the
object
of
your
visit
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
is
in
MY
confidence
,
"
replied
Watkins
,
with
considerable
importance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
sir
,
"
said
Timson
,
seizing
both
Tottle
's
hands
,
"
allow
me
in
his
presence
to
thank
you
most
unfeignedly
and
cordially
,
for
the
noble
part
you
have
acted
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
thinks
I
recommended
him
,
"
thought
Tottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Confound
these
fellows
!
<EOS>
they
never
think
of
anything
but
their
fees
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
deeply
regret
having
misunderstood
your
intentions
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
continued
Timson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Disinterested
and
manly
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
There
are
very
few
men
who
would
have
acted
as
you
have
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
could
not
help
thinking
that
this
last
remark
was
anything
but
complimentary
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
inquired
,
rather
hastily
,
"
When
is
it
to
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
Thursday
,
"
replied
Timson
,
---
"
on
Thursday
morning
at
half
-
past
eight
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Uncommonly
early
,
"
observed
Watkins
Tottle
,
with
an
air
of
triumphant
self
-
denial
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hardly
be
able
to
get
down
here
by
that
hour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
This
was
intended
for
a
joke
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
replied
Timson
,
all
suavity
,
shaking
hands
with
Tottle
again
most
heartily
,
"
so
long
as
we
see
you
to
breakfast
,
you
know
---
"
   
"
Eh
!
"
said
Parsons
,
with
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
expressions
of
countenance
that
ever
appeared
in
a
human
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Watkins
Tottle
,
at
the
same
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
that
so
long
as
we
see
you
to
breakfast
,
"
replied
Timson
,
"
we
will
excuse
your
being
absent
from
the
ceremony
,
though
of
course
your
presence
at
it
would
give
us
the
utmost
pleasure
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
staggered
against
the
wall
,
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
Timson
with
appalling
perseverance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Timson
,
"
said
Parsons
,
hurriedly
brushing
his
hat
with
his
left
arm
,
"
when
you
say
"
us
,
"
whom
do
you
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Timson
looked
foolish
in
his
turn
,
when
he
replied
,
"
Why
---
Mrs
Timson
that
will
be
this
day
week
:
 
Miss
Lillerton
that
is
---
"
   
"
Now
do
n't
stare
at
that
idiot
in
the
corner
,
"
angrily
exclaimed
Parsons
,
as
the
extraordinary
convulsions
of
Watkins
Tottle
's
countenance
excited
the
wondering
gaze
of
Timson
,
---
"
but
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
in
three
words
the
contents
of
that
note
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
note
,
"
replied
Timson
,
"
is
from
Miss
Lillerton
,
to
whom
I
have
been
for
the
last
five
weeks
regularly
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
Her
singular
scruples
and
strange
feeling
on
some
points
have
hitherto
prevented
my
bringing
the
engagement
to
that
termination
which
I
so
anxiously
desire
.
 
<EOS>
She
informs
me
here
,
that
she
sounded
Mrs
Parsons
with
the
view
of
making
her
her
confidante
and
go
-
between
,
that
Mrs
Parsons
informed
this
elderly
gentleman
,
Mr
Tottle
,
of
the
circumstance
,
and
that
he
,
in
the
most
kind
and
delicate
terms
,
offered
to
assist
us
in
any
way
,
and
even
undertook
to
convey
this
note
,
which
contains
the
promise
I
have
long
sought
in
vain
---
an
act
of
kindness
for
which
I
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
Timson
,
"
said
Parsons
,
hurrying
off
,
and
carrying
the
bewildered
Tottle
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
stay
---
and
have
something
?
"
said
Timson
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
ye
,
"
replied
Parsons
;
"
I
've
had
quite
enough
;
"
and
away
he
went
,
followed
by
Watkins
Tottle
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
whistled
until
they
had
walked
some
quarter
of
a
mile
past
his
own
gate
,
when
he
suddenly
stopped
,
and
said
---
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
clever
fellow
,
Tottle
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
the
unfortunate
Watkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
'll
say
this
is
Fanny
's
fault
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Gabriel
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
"
replied
the
bewildered
Tottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Parsons
,
turning
on
his
heel
to
go
home
,
"
the
next
time
you
make
an
offer
,
you
had
better
speak
plainly
,
and
do
n't
throw
a
chance
away
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
next
time
you
're
locked
up
in
a
spunging
-
house
<EOS>
,
just
wait
there
till
I
come
and
take
you
out
<EOS>
,
there
's
a
good
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
How
,
or
at
what
hour
,
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
returned
to
Cecil
-
street
is
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
His
boots
were
seen
outside
his
bedroom
-
door
next
morning
;
but
we
have
the
authority
of
his
landlady
for
stating
that
he
neither
emerged
therefrom
nor
accepted
sustenance
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
that
period
,
and
when
a
council
of
war
was
being
held
in
the
kitchen
on
the
propriety
of
summoning
the
parochial
beadle
to
break
his
door
open
,
he
rang
his
bell
,
and
demanded
a
cup
of
milk
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
morning
he
went
through
the
formalities
of
eating
and
drinking
as
usual
,
but
a
week
afterwards
he
was
seized
with
a
relapse
,
while
perusing
the
list
of
marriages
in
a
morning
paper
,
from
which
he
never
perfectly
recovered
.
   
<EOS>
A
few
weeks
after
the
last
-
named
occurrence
,
the
body
of
a
gentleman
unknown
,
was
found
in
the
Regent
's
canal
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
trousers
-
pockets
were
four
shillings
and
threepence
halfpenny
;
a
matrimonial
advertisement
from
a
lady
,
which
appeared
to
have
been
cut
out
of
a
Sunday
paper
:
 
a
tooth
-
pick
,
and
a
card
-
case
,
which
it
is
confidently
believed
would
have
led
to
the
identification
of
the
unfortunate
gentleman
,
but
for
the
circumstance
of
there
being
none
but
blank
cards
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
absented
himself
from
his
lodgings
shortly
before
.
 
<EOS>
A
bill
,
which
has
not
been
taken
up
,
was
presented
next
morning
;
and
a
bill
,
which
has
not
been
taken
down
,
was
soon
afterwards
affixed
in
his
parlour
-
window
.
   
<EOS>
The
Bloomsbury
christening
Mr
Nicodemus
Dumps
,
or
,
as
his
acquaintance
called
him
,
"
long
Dumps
,
"
was
a
bachelor
,
six
feet
high
,
and
fifty
years
old
:
 
cross
,
cadaverous
,
odd
,
and
ill
-
natured
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
never
happy
but
when
he
was
miserable
;
and
always
miserable
when
he
had
the
best
reason
to
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
real
comfort
of
his
existence
was
to
make
everybody
about
him
wretched
---
then
he
might
be
truly
said
to
enjoy
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
afflicted
with
a
situation
in
the
Bank
worth
five
hundred
a
-
year
,
and
he
rented
a
"
first
-
floor
furnished
,
"
at
Pentonville
,
which
he
originally
took
because
it
commanded
a
dismal
prospect
of
an
adjacent
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
familiar
with
the
face
of
every
tombstone
,
and
the
burial
service
seemed
to
excite
his
strongest
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
His
friends
said
he
was
surly
---
he
insisted
he
was
nervous
;
they
thought
him
a
lucky
dog
,
but
he
protested
that
he
was
"
the
most
unfortunate
man
in
the
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
Cold
as
he
was
,
and
wretched
as
he
declared
himself
to
be
<EOS>
,
he
was
not
wholly
unsusceptible
of
attachments
.
 
<EOS>
He
revered
the
memory
of
Hoyle
,
as
he
was
himself
an
admirable
and
imperturbable
whist
-
player
,
and
he
chuckled
with
delight
at
a
fretful
and
impatient
adversary
.
 
<EOS>
He
adored
King
Herod
for
his
massacre
of
the
innocents
;
and
if
he
hated
one
thing
more
than
another
,
it
was
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
hate
anything
in
particular
,
because
he
disliked
everything
in
general
;
but
perhaps
his
greatest
antipathies
were
cabs
,
old
women
,
doors
that
would
not
shut
,
musical
amateurs
,
and
omnibus
cads
.
 
<EOS>
He
subscribed
to
the
"
Society
for
the
Suppression
of
Vice
"
for
the
pleasure
of
putting
a
stop
to
any
harmless
amusements
;
and
he
contributed
largely
towards
the
support
of
two
itinerant
methodist
parsons
,
in
the
amiable
hope
that
if
circumstances
rendered
any
people
happy
in
this
world
,
they
might
perchance
be
rendered
miserable
by
fears
for
the
next
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dumps
had
a
nephew
who
had
been
married
about
a
year
,
and
who
was
somewhat
of
a
favourite
with
his
uncle
,
because
he
was
an
admirable
subject
to
exercise
his
misery
-
creating
powers
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Charles
Kitterbell
was
a
small
,
sharp
,
spare
man
,
with
a
very
large
head
,
and
a
broad
,
good
-
humoured
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
like
a
faded
giant
,
with
the
head
and
face
partially
restored
;
and
he
had
a
cast
in
his
eye
which
rendered
it
quite
impossible
for
any
one
with
whom
he
conversed
to
know
where
he
was
looking
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
appeared
fixed
on
the
wall
,
and
he
was
staring
you
out
of
countenance
;
in
short
,
there
was
no
catching
his
eye
,
and
perhaps
it
is
a
merciful
dispensation
of
Providence
that
such
eyes
are
not
catching
.
 
<EOS>
In
addition
to
these
characteristics
,
it
may
be
added
that
Mr
Charles
Kitterbell
was
one
of
the
most
credulous
and
matter
-
of
-
fact
little
personages
that
ever
took
TO
himself
a
wife
,
and
FOR
himself
a
house
in
Great
Russell
-
street
,
Bedford
-
square
.
<EOS>
(
Uncle
Dumps
always
dropped
the
"
Bedford
-
square
,
"
and
inserted
in
lieu
thereof
the
dreadful
words
"
Tottenham

<EOS>
No

said
Mr
Kitterbell
,
as
he
sat
in
conversation
with
his
respected
relative
one
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
indeed
I
can
not

"
returned
Dumps
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
Jemima
will
think
it
very
unkind
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
little
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
trouble
,
"
rejoined
the
most
unhappy
man
in
existence
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
that
;
but
my
nerves
are
in
that
state
<EOS>
---
I
can
not
go
through
the
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
do
n't
like
going
out

<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
,
Charles
,
do
n't
fidget
with
that
stool
so
;
you
'll
drive
me
mad
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Kitterbell
,
quite
regardless
of
his
uncle
's
nerves
,
had
occupied
himself
for
some
ten
minutes
in
describing
a
circle
on
the
floor
with
one
leg
of
the
office
-
stool
on
which
he
was
seated
,
keeping
the
other
three
up
in
the
air
,
and
holding
fast
on
by
the
desk
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
uncle
,
"
said
Kitterbell
,
quite
abashed
,
suddenly
releasing
his
hold
of
the
desk
,
and
bringing
the
three
wandering
legs
back
to
the
floor
,
with
a
force
sufficient
to
drive
them
through
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
come
,
do
n't
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
's
a
boy
,
you
know
,
we
must
have
two
godfathers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
IF
it
's
a
boy
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dumps
;
<EOS>
"
why
ca
n't
you
say
at
once
whether
it
IS
a
boy
or
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
happy
to
tell
you
,
but
it
's
impossible
I
can
undertake
to
say
whether
it
's
a
girl
or
a
boy
,
if
the
child
is
n't
born
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
born
yet
!
"
echoed
Dumps
,
with
a
gleam
of
hope
lighting
up
his
lugubrious
visage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
,
it
MAY
be
a
girl
,
and
then
you
wo
n't
want
me
;
or
if
it
is
a
boy
,
it
MAY
die
before
it
is
christened
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
the
father
that
expected
to
be
,
looking
very
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
acquiesced
Dumps
,
evidently
pleased
with
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
was
beginning
to
get
happy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
but
distressing
cases
frequently
occur
during
the
first
two
or
three
days
of
a
child
's
life
;
fits
,
I
am
told
,
are
exceedingly
common
,
and
alarming
convulsions
are
almost
matters
of
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
uncle
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
little
Kitterbell
,
gasping
for
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
my
landlady
was
confined
---
<EOS>
let
me
see
---
last
Tuesday
:
 
an
uncommonly
fine
boy
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
Thursday
night
the
nurse
was
sitting
with
him
upon
her
knee
before
the
fire
,
and
he
was
as
well
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
became
black
in
the
face
,
and
alarmingly
spasmodic
.
 
<EOS>
The
medical
man
was
instantly
sent
for
,
and
every
remedy
was
tried
,
but
---
"
   
"
How
frightful
!
<EOS>
"
interrupted
the
horror
-
stricken
Kitterbell
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
child
died
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
your
child
MAY
not
die
;
and
if
it
should
be
a
boy
,
and
should
LIVE
to
be
christened
<EOS>
,
why
I
suppose
I
must
be
one
of
the
sponsors
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Dumps
was
evidently
good
-
natured
on
the
faith
of
his
anticipations
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
uncle
,
"
said
his
agitated
nephew
,
grasping
his
hand
as
warmly
as
if
he
had
done
him
some
essential
service
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
had
better
not
tell
Mrs
K
what
you
have
mentioned
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
she
's
low
-
spirited
,
perhaps
you
had
better
not
mention
the
melancholy
case
to
her
,
"
returned
Dumps
,
who
of
course
had
invented
the
whole
story
;
"
though
perhaps
it
would
be
but
doing
your
duty
as
a
husband
to
prepare
her
for
the
WORST
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
afterwards
,
as
Dumps
was
perusing
a
morning
paper
at
the
chop
-
house
which
he
regularly
frequented
,
the
following
-
paragraph
met
his
eyes
:

On

the
18th

in
Great
Russell

,
the
lady
of
Charles
Kitterbell
,
Esq
,
of
a
son
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
IS
a

"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
dashing
down
the
paper
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
waiters
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
IS
a
boy
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
speedily
regained
his
composure
as
his
eye
rested
on
a
paragraph
quoting
the
number
of
infant
deaths
from
the
bills
of
mortality
.
   
<EOS>
Six
weeks
passed
away
,
and
as
no
communication
had
been
received
from
the
Kitterbells
,
Dumps
was
beginning
to
flatter
himself
that
the
child
was
dead
,
when
the
following
note
painfully
resolved
his
doubts
:
---
   
"
GREAT
RUSSELL
-
STREET
,
MONDAY
MORNING
.
   
<EOS>
DEAR
UNCLE
,
---
You
will
be
delighted
to
hear
that
my
dear
Jemima
has
left
her
room
,
and
that
your
future
godson
is
getting
on
capitally
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
thin
at
first
,
but
he
is
getting
much
larger
,
and
nurse
says
he
is
filling
out
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
cries
a
good
deal
,
and
is
a
very
singular
colour
,
which
made
Jemima
and
me
rather
uncomfortable
;
but
as
nurse
says
it
's
natural
,
and
as
of
course
we
know
nothing
about
these
things
yet
,
we
are
quite
satisfied
with
what
nurse
says
.
 
<EOS>
We
think
he
will
be
a
sharp
child
;
and
nurse
says
she
's
sure
he
will
,
because
he
never
goes
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
readily
believe
that
we
are
all
very
happy
,
only
we
're
a
little
worn
out
for
want
of
rest
,
as
he
keeps
us
awake
all
night
;
but
this
we
must
expect
,
nurse
says
,
for
the
first
six
or
eight
months
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
vaccinated
,
but
in
consequence
of
the
operation
being
rather
awkwardly
performed
,
some
small
particles
of
glass
were
introduced
into
the
arm
with
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
may
in
some
degree
account
for
his
being
rather
fractious
;
at
least
,
so
nurse
says
.
 
<EOS>
We
propose
to
have
him
christened
at
twelve
o'clock
on
Friday
,
at
Saint
George
's
church
,
in
Hart
-
street
,
by
the
name
of
Frederick
Charles
William
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
be
later
than
a
quarter
before
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
very
few
friends
in
the
evening
,
when
of
course
we
shall
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
dear
boy
appears
rather
restless
and
uneasy
to
-
day
:
 
<EOS>
the
cause
,
I
fear
,
is
fever
.
   
<EOS>

Believe
me
,
dear
Uncle
,

Yours
affectionately

I
open
this
note
to
say
that
we
have
just
discovered
the
cause
of
little
Frederick
's
restlessness
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
fever
,
as
I
apprehended
,
but
a
small
pin
,
which
nurse
accidentally
stuck
in
his
leg
yesterday
evening
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
taken
it
out
,
and
he
appears
more
composed
,
though
he
still
sobs
a
good
deal
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
almost
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
perusal
of
the
above
interesting
statement
was
no
great
relief
to
the
mind
of
the
hypochondriacal
Dumps
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
recede
,
however
,
and
so
he
put
the
best
face
---
<EOS>
that
is
to
say
,
an
uncommonly
miserable
one
---
upon
the
matter
;
and
purchased
a
handsome
silver
mug
for
the
infant
Kitterbell
,
upon
which
he
ordered
the
initials
"
F*C*W*K
,
"
with
the
customary
untrained
grape
-
vine
-
looking
flourishes
,
and
a
large
full
stop
,
to
be
engraved
forthwith
.
   
<EOS>
Monday
was
a
fine
day
<EOS>
,
Tuesday
was
delightful
,
Wednesday
was
equal
to
either
,
and
Thursday
was
finer
than
ever
;
four
successive
fine
days
in
London
!
 
<EOS>
Hackney
-
coachmen
became
revolutionary
,
and
crossing
-
sweepers
began
to
doubt
the
existence
of
a
First
Cause
.
<EOS>
The
MORNING
HERALD
informed
its
readers
that
an
old
woman
in
Camden
Town
had
been
heard
to
say
that
the
fineness
of
the
season
was
"
unprecedented
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
;
"
and
Islington
clerks
,
with
large
families
and
small
salaries
,
left
off
their
black
gaiters
,
disdained
to
carry
their
once
green
cotton
umbrellas
,
and
walked
to
town
in
the
conscious
pride
of
white
stockings
and
cleanly
brushed
Bluchers
.
 
<EOS>
Dumps
beheld
all
this
with
an
eye
of
supreme
contempt
---
his
triumph
was
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
if
it
had
been
fine
for
four
weeks
instead
of
four
days
,
it
would
rain
when
he
went
out
;
he
was
lugubriously
happy
in
the
conviction
that
Friday
would
be
a
wretched
day
---
and
so
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
how
it
would
be
,
"
said
Dumps
,
as
he
turned
round
opposite
the
Mansion
-
house
at
half
-
past
eleven
o'clock
on
the
Friday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
how
it
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
concerned
,
and
that
's
enough
;
"
---
and
certainly
the
appearance
of
the
day
was
sufficient
to
depress
the
spirits
of
a
much
more
buoyant
-
hearted
individual
than
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
rained
,
without
a
moment
's
cessation
,
since
eight
o'clock
;
everybody
that
passed
up
Cheapside
,
and
down
Cheapside
,
looked
wet
,
cold
,
and
dirty
.
 
<EOS>
All
sorts
of
forgotten
and
long
-
concealed
umbrellas
had
been
put
into
requisition
.
 
<EOS>
Cabs
whisked
about
,
with
the
"
fare
"
as
carefully
boxed
up
behind
two
glazed
calico
curtains
as
any
mysterious
picture
in
any
one
of
Mrs
Radcliffe
's
castles
;
omnibus
horses
smoked
like
steam
-
engines
;
nobody
thought
of
"
standing
up
"
under
doorways
or
arches
;
they
were
painfully
convinced
it
was
a
hopeless
case
;
and
so
everybody
went
hastily
along
,
jumbling
and
jostling
,
and
swearing
and
perspiring
,
and
slipping
about
,
like
amateur
skaters
behind
wooden
chairs
on
the
Serpentine
on
a
frosty
Sunday
.
   
<EOS>
Dumps
paused
;
he
could
not
think
of
walking
,
being
rather
smart
for
the
christening
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
took
a
cab
he
was
sure
to
be
spilt
,
and
a
hackney
-
coach
was
too
expensive
for
his
economical
ideas
.
 
<EOS>
An
omnibus
was
waiting
at
the
opposite
corner
---
it
was
a
desperate
case
---
he
had
never
heard
of
an
omnibus
upsetting
or
running
away
,
and
if
the
cad
did
knock
him
down
,
he
could
"
pull
him
up
"
in
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
!
"
cried
the
young
gentleman
who
officiated
as
"
cad
"
to
the
"
Lads
of
the
Village
,
"
which
was
the
name
of
the
machine
just
noticed
.
 
<EOS>
Dumps
crossed
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
vay
,
sir
!
"
shouted
the
driver
of
the
"
Hark
-
away
,
"
pulling
up
his
vehicle
immediately
across
the
door
of
the
opposition
---
"
This
vay
,
sir
<EOS>
---
he
's
full
.
"
 
<EOS>
Dumps
hesitated
,
<EOS>
whereupon
the
"
Lads
of
the
Village
"
commenced
pouring
out
a
torrent
of
abuse
against
the
"
Hark
-
away
;
"
but
the
conductor
of
the
"
Admiral
Napier
"
settled
the
contest
in
a
most
satisfactory
manner
,
for
all
parties
,
by
seizing
Dumps
round
the
waist
,
and
thrusting
him
into
the
middle
of
his
vehicle
which
had
just
come
up
and
only
wanted
the
sixteenth
inside
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
right
,
"
said
the
"
Admiral
,
"
and
off
the
thing
thundered
,
like
a
fire
-
engine
at
full
gallop
,
with
the
kidnapped
customer
inside
,
standing
in
the
position
of
a
half
doubled
-
up
bootjack
,
and
falling
about
with
every
jerk
of
the
machine
,
first
on
the
one
side
,
and
then
on
the
other
,
like
a
"
Jack
-
in
-
the
-
green
,
"
on
May
-
day
,
setting
to
the
lady
with
a
brass
ladle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
where
am
I
to
sit
?
"
inquired
the
miserable
man
of
an
old
gentleman
,
into
whose
stomach
he
had
just
fallen
for
the
fourth
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anywhere
but
on
my
CHEST
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
in
a
surly
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
the
BOX
would
suit
the
gentleman
better
,
"
suggested
a
very
damp
lawyer
's
clerk
,
in
a
pink
shirt
,
and
a
smirking
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
great
deal
of
struggling
and
falling
about
,
Dumps
at
last
managed
to
squeeze
himself
into
a
seat
,
which
,
in
addition
to
the
slight
disadvantage
of
being
between
a
window
that
would
not
shut
,
and
a
door
that
must
be
open
,
placed
him
in
close
contact
with
a
passenger
,
who
had
been
walking
about
all
the
morning
without
an
umbrella
,
and
who
looked
as
if
he
had
spent
the
day
in
a
full
water
-
butt
---
only
wetter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
bang
the
door
so
,
"
said
Dumps
to
the
conductor
,
as
he
shut
it
after
letting
out
four
of
the
passengers
;
I
am
very
nervous
---
it
destroys
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
any
gen'lm'n
say
anythink
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
cad
,
thrusting
in
his
head
,
and
trying
to
look
as
if
he
did
n't
understand
the
request
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
not
to
bang
the
door
so
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Dumps
,
with
an
expression
of
countenance
like
the
knave
of
clubs
,
in
convulsions
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
vy
,
it
's
rather
a
sing'ler
circumstance
about
this
here
door
,
sir
,
that
it
von't
shut
without
banging
,
"
replied
the
conductor
;
and
he
opened
the
door
very
wide
,
and
shut
it
again
with
a
terrific
bang
,
in
proof
of
the
assertion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
a
little
prim
,
wheezing
old
gentleman
,
sitting
opposite
Dumps
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
;
but
have
you
ever
observed
,
when
you
have
been
in
an
omnibus
on
a
wet
day
,
that
four
people
out
of
five
always
come
in
with
large
cotton
umbrellas
,
without
a
handle
at
the
top
,
or
the
brass
spike
at
the
bottom
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
returned
Dumps
,
as
he
heard
the
clock
strike
twelve
,
"
it
never
struck
me
before
;
but
now
you
mention
it
,
<EOS>
I
---
Hollo
!
<EOS>
hollo
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
the
persecuted
individual
,
as
the
omnibus
dashed
past
Drury
-
lane
,
where
he
had
directed
to
be
set
down
.
<EOS>
---
"
Where
is
the
cad
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
's
on
the
box
,
sir
,
"
said
the
young
gentleman
before
noticed
in
the
pink
shirt
,
which
looked
like
a
white
one
ruled
with
red
ink
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
be
set
down
!
"
said
Dumps
in
a
faint
voice
,
overcome
by
his
previous
efforts
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
these
cads
want
to
be
SET
DOWN
,
"
returned
the
attorney
's
clerk
,
chuckling
at
his
sally
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dumps
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
echoed
the
passengers
.
 
<EOS>
The
omnibus
passed
St
Giles
's
church
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
hard
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
conductor
;
<EOS>
"
I
'm
blowed
if
we
ha'n't
forgot
the
gen'lm'n
as
vas
to
be
set
down
at
Doory
-
lane
.
<EOS>
---
Now
,
sir
,
make
haste
,
if
you
please
,
"
he
added
,
opening
the
door
,
and
assisting
Dumps
out
with
as
much
coolness
as
if
it
was
"
all
right
.
"
 
<EOS>
Dumps
's
indignation
was
for
once
getting
the
better
of
his
cynical
equanimity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Drury
-
lane
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
gasped
,
with
the
voice
of
a
boy
in
a
cold
bath
for
the
first
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doory
-
lane
,
sir
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
---
third
turning
on
the
right
-
hand
side
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dumps
's
passion
was
paramount
:
 
<EOS>
he
clutched
his
umbrella
,
and
was
striding
off
with
the
firm
determination
of
not
paying
the
fare
.
<EOS>
The
cad
,
by
a
remarkable
coincidence
,
happened
to
entertain
a
directly
contrary
opinion
,
and
Heaven
knows
how
far
the
altercation
would
have
proceeded
,
if
it
had
not
been
most
ably
and
satisfactorily
brought
to
a
close
by
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
!
"
said
that
respectable
person
,
standing
up
on
the
box
,
and
leaning
with
one
hand
on
the
roof
of
the
omnibus
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
Tom
!
<EOS>
tell
the
gentleman
if
so
be
as
he
feels
aggrieved
,
we
will
take
him
up
to
the
Edge
-
er
(
Edgeware
)
Road
for
nothing
,
and
set
him
down
at
Doory
-
lane
when
we
comes
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
reject
that
,
anyhow
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
argument
was
irresistible
:
 
Dumps
paid
the
disputed
sixpence
,
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
on
the
staircase
of
No
.
14
,
Great
Russell
-
street
.
   
<EOS>
Everything
indicated
that
preparations
were
making
for
the
reception
of
"
a
few
friends
"
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Two
dozen
extra
tumblers
,
and
four
ditto
wine
-
glasses
---
looking
anything
but
transparent
,
with
little
bits
of
straw
in
them
on
the
slab
in
the
passage
,
just
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
smell
of
nutmeg
,
port
wine
,
and
almonds
,
on
the
staircase
;
the
covers
were
taken
off
the
stair
-
carpet
,
and
the
figure
of
Venus
on
the
first
landing
looked
as
if
she
were
ashamed
of
the
composition
-
candle
in
her
right
hand
,
which
contrasted
beautifully
with
the
lamp
-
blacked
drapery
of
the
goddess
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
The
female
servant
(
who
looked
very
warm
and
bustling
)
ushered
Dumps
into
a
front
drawing
-
room
,
very
prettily
furnished
,
with
a
plentiful
sprinkling
of
little
baskets
,
paper
table
-
mats
,
china
watchmen
,
pink
and
gold
albums
,
and
rainbow
-
bound
little
books
on
the
different
tables
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
uncle
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Kitterbell
,
"
how
d'ye
do
?
 
<EOS>
Allow
me
---
Jemima
,
my
dear
---
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
've
seen
Jemima
before
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Have
had
the
PLEASURE
,
"
returned
big
Dumps
,
his
tone
and
look
making
it
doubtful
whether
in
his
life
he
had
ever
experienced
the
sensation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Mrs
Kitterbell
,
with
a
languid
smile
,
and
a
slight
cough
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
---
hem
---
any
friend
---
of
Charles
's
---
hem
---
much
less
a
relation
,
is
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
'd
say
so
,
my
love
,
"
said
little
Kitterbell
,
who
,
while
he
appeared
to
be
gazing
on
the
opposite
houses
,
was
looking
at
his
wife
with
a
most
affectionate
air
:
 
"
Bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
last
two
words
were
accompanied
with
a
simper
,
and
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
,
which
stirred
up
all
Uncle
Dumps
's
bile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
tell
nurse
to
bring
down
baby
,
"
said
Mrs
Kitterbell
,
addressing
the
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Kitterbell
was
a
tall
,
thin
young
lady
,
with
very
light
hair
,
and
a
particularly
white
face
---
one
of
those
young
women
who
almost
invariably
,
though
one
hardly
knows
why
,
recall
to
one
's
mind
the
idea
of
a
cold
fillet
of
veal
.
 
<EOS>
Out
went
the
servant
,
and
in
came
the
nurse
,
with
a
remarkably
small
parcel
in
her
arms
,
packed
up
in
a
blue
mantle
trimmed
with
white
fur
.
<EOS>
---
This
was
the
baby
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
uncle
,
"
said
Mr
Kitterbell
,
lifting
up
that
part
of
the
mantle
which
covered
the
infant
's
face
,
with
an
air
of
great
triumph
,
<EOS>
"
WHO
do
you
think
he
's
like
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
!
<EOS>
he
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
who
?
"
said
Mrs
K
,
putting
her
arm
through
her
husband
's
,
and
looking
up
into
Dumps
's
face
with
an
expression
of
as
much
interest
as
she
was
capable
of
displaying
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
God
,
how
small
he
is
!
"
cried
the
amiable
uncle
,
starting
back
with
well
-
feigned
surprise
;
"
REMARKABLY
small
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
poor
little
Kitterbell
,
rather
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
monster
to
what
he
was
---
ai
n't
he
,
nurse
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
dear
,
"
said
the
nurse
,
squeezing
the
child
,
and
evading
the
question
---
<EOS>
not
because
she
scrupled
to
disguise
the
fact
,
but
because
she
could
n't
afford
to
throw
away
the
chance
of
Dumps
's
half
-
crown
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
who
is
he
like
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
little
Kitterbell
.
   
<EOS>
Dumps
looked
at
the
little
pink
heap
before
him
,
and
only
thought
at
the
moment
of
the
best
mode
of
mortifying
the
youthful
parents
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
n't
know
WHO
he
's
like
,
"
he
answered
,
very
well
knowing
the
reply
expected
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
he
's
like
ME
?
"
inquired
his
nephew
with
a
knowing
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
DECIDEDLY
not
!
"
returned
Dumps
,
with
an
emphasis
not
to
be
misunderstood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
not
like
you
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Oh
,
certainly
not
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
Like
Jemima
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Kitterbell
,
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
no
;
not
in
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
no
judge
,
of
course
,
in
such
cases
;
but
I
really
think
he
's
more
like
one
of
those
little
carved
representations
that
one
sometimes
sees
blowing
a
trumpet
on
a
tombstone
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
nurse
stooped
down
over
the
child
,
and
with
great
difficulty
prevented
an
explosion
of
mirth
.
 
<EOS>
Pa
and
ma
looked
almost
as
miserable
as
their
amiable
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
disappointed
little
father
,
"
you
'll
be
better
able
to
tell
what
he
's
like
by
-
and
-
by
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
see
him
this
evening
with
his
mantle
off
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Dumps
,
feeling
particularly
grateful
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
love
,
"
said
Kitterbell
to
his
wife
,
"
it
's
time
we
were
off
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
to
meet
the
other
godfather
and
the
godmother
at
the
church
,
uncle
,
---
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Wilson
from
over
the
way
---
uncommonly
nice
people
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
,
are
you
well
wrapped
up
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
you
wo
n't
have
another
shawl
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
anxious
husband
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sweet
,
"
returned
the
charming
mother
,
accepting
Dumps
's
proffered
arm
;
and
the
little
party
entered
the
hackney
-
coach
that
was
to
take
them
to
the
church
;
Dumps
amusing
Mrs
Kitterbell
by
expatiating
largely
on
the
danger
of
measles
,
thrush
,
teeth
-
cutting
,
and
other
interesting
diseases
to
which
children
are
subject
.
   
<EOS>
The
ceremony
(
which
occupied
about
five
minutes
)
passed
off
without
anything
particular
occurring
.
 
<EOS>
The
clergyman
had
to
dine
some
distance
from
town
,
and
had
two
churchings
,
three
christenings
,
and
a
funeral
to
perform
in
something
less
than
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
The
godfathers
and
godmother
,
therefore
,
promised
to
renounce
the
devil
and
all
his
works
---
"
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
"
---
as
little
Kitterbell
said
---
"
in
less
than
no
time
;
"
and
with
the
exception
of
Dumps
nearly
letting
the
child
fall
into
the
font
when
he
handed
it
to
the
clergyman
,
the
whole
affair
went
off
in
the
usual
business
-
like
and
matter
-
of
-
course
manner
,
and
Dumps
re
-
entered
the
Bank
-
gates
at
two
o'clock
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
the
painful
conviction
that
he
was
regularly
booked
for
an
evening
party
.
   
<EOS>
Evening
came
---
and
so
did
Dumps
's
pumps
,
black
silk
stockings
,
and
white
cravat
which
he
had
ordered
to
be
forwarded
,
per
boy
,
from
Pentonville
.
 
<EOS>
The
depressed
godfather
dressed
himself
at
a
friend
's
counting
-
house
,
from
whence
,
with
his
spirits
fifty
degrees
below
proof
,
he
sallied
forth
---
as
the
weather
had
cleared
up
,
and
the
evening
was
tolerably
fine
---
to
walk
to
Great
Russell
-
street
.
<EOS>
Slowly
he
paced
up
Cheapside
,
Newgate
-
street
,
down
Snow
-
hill
,
and
up
Holborn
ditto
,
looking
as
grim
as
the
figure
-
head
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
,
and
finding
out
fresh
causes
of
misery
at
every
step
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
crossing
the
corner
of
Hatton
-
garden
,
a
man
apparently
intoxicated
,
rushed
against
him
,
and
would
have
knocked
him
down
,
had

caught
by

genteel
young
man

who
happened
to
be
close
to
him

<EOS>
The
shock
so
disarranged
Dumps
's
nerves
,
as
well
as
his
dress
,
that
he
could
hardly
stand
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
took
his
arm
,
and
in
the
kindest
manner
walked
with
him
as
far
as
Furnival
's
Inn
.
 
<EOS>
Dumps
,
for
about
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
felt
grateful
and
polite
;
and
he
and
the
gentlemanly
-
looking
young
man
parted
with
mutual
expressions
of
good
will
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
at
least
some
well
-
disposed
men
in
the
world
,
"
ruminated
the
misanthropical
Dumps
,
as
he
proceeded
towards
his
destination
.

knocked
a
hackney

coachman
at
Kitterbell
's
door
,
in
imitation
of
a
gentleman
's
servant
,
just
as
Dumps
reached
it
;
and
out
came
an
old
lady
in
a
large
toque
,
and
an
old
gentleman
in
a
blue
coat
,
and
three
female
copies
of
the
old
lady
in
pink
dresses
,
and
shoes
to
match
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
large
party
,
"
sighed
the
unhappy
godfather
,
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
,
and
leaning
against
the
area
-
railings
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
the
miserable
man
could
muster
up
courage
to
knock
at
the
door
,
and
when
he
did
,
the
smart
appearance
of
a
neighbouring
greengrocer
(
who
had
been
hired
to
wait
for
seven
and
sixpence
,
and
whose
calves
alone
were
worth
double
the
money
)
,
the
lamp
in
the
passage
,
and
the
Venus
on
the
landing
,
<EOS>
added
to
the
hum
of
many
voices
,
and
the
sound
of
a
harp
and
two
violins
,
painfully
convinced
him
that
his
surmises
were
but
too
well
founded
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
"
said
little
Kitterbell
,
in
a
greater
bustle
than
ever
,
bolting
out
of
the
little
back
parlour
with
a
cork
-
screw
in
his
hand
,
and
various
particles
of
sawdust
,
looking
like
so
many
inverted
commas
,
on
his
inexpressibles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
"
said
Dumps
,
turning
into
the
aforesaid
parlour
to
put
his
shoes
on
,
which
he
had
brought
in
his
coat
-
pocket
,
and
still
more
appalled
by
the
sight
of
seven
fresh
-
drawn
corks
,
and
a
corresponding
number
of
decanters
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
many
people
are
there
up
-
stairs
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
above
thirty
-
five
.
 
<EOS>
We
've
had
the
carpet
taken
up
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
and
the
piano
and
the
card
-
tables
are
in
the
front
.
 
<EOS>
Jemima
thought
we
'd
better
have
a
regular
sit
-
down
supper
in
the
front
parlour
,
because
of
the
speechifying
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
uncle
,
what
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
continued
the
excited
little
man
,
as
Dumps
stood
with
one
shoe
on
,
rummaging
his
pockets
with
the
most
frightful
distortion
of
visage
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
lost
?
<EOS>
Your
pocket
-
book
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
Dumps
,
diving
first
into
one
pocket
and
then
into
the
other
,
and
speaking
in
a
voice
like
Desdemona
with
the
pillow
over
her
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
card
-
case
?
<EOS>
snuff
-
box
?
<EOS>
the
key
of
your
lodgings
?
"
<EOS>
continued
Kitterbell
,
pouring
question
on
question
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
no
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Dumps
,
still
diving
eagerly
into
his
empty
pockets
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
---
not
---
the
MUG
you
spoke
of
this
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
the
MUG
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Dumps
,
sinking
into
a
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
COULD
you
have
done
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Kitterbell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
you
brought
it
out
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dumps
,
starting
up
as
the
idea
flashed
across
his
mind
;
"
miserable
dog
that
I
am
---
<EOS>
I
was
born
to
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
gentlemanly
-
looking
young
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dumps
!
"
shouted
the
greengrocer
in
a
stentorian
voice
,
as
he
ushered
the
somewhat
recovered
godfather
into
the
drawing
-
room
half
an
hour
after
the
above
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dumps
!
"
<EOS>
---
everybody
looked
at
the
door
,
and
in
came
Dumps
,
feeling
about
as
much
out
of
place
as
a
salmon
might
be
supposed
to
be
on
a
gravel
-
walk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Happy
to
see
you
again
,
"
said
Mrs
Kitterbell
,
quite
unconscious
of
the
unfortunate
man
's
confusion
and
misery
;
"
you
must
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
a
few
of
our
friends
:
---
my
mamma
,
Mr
Dumps
---
my
papa
and
sisters
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Dumps
seized
the
hand
of
the
mother
as
warmly
as
if
she
was
his
own
parent
,
bowed
TO
the
young
ladies
,
and
AGAINST
a
gentleman
behind
him
,
and
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
father
,
who
had
been
bowing
incessantly
for
three
minutes
and
a
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
"
said
little
Kitterbell
,
after
Dumps
had
been
introduced
to
a
select
dozen
or
two
,
"
you
must
let
me
lead
you
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
to
introduce
you
to
my
friend
Danton
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
splendid
fellow
!
<EOS>
---
I
'm
sure
you
'll
like
him
---
this
way
,
"
---
Dumps
followed
as
tractably
as
a
tame
bear
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Danton
was
a
young
man
of
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
with
a
considerable
stock
of
impudence
,
and
a
very
small
share
of
ideas
:
he
was
a
great
favourite
,
especially
with
young
ladies
of
from
sixteen
to
twenty
-
six
years
of
age
,
both
inclusive
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
imitate
the
French
-
horn
to
admiration
,
sang
comic
songs
most
inimitably
,
and
had
the
most
insinuating
way
of
saying
impertinent
nothings
to
his
doting
female
admirers
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
acquired
,
somehow
or
other
,
the
reputation
of
being
a
great
wit
,
and
,
accordingly
,
whenever
he
opened
his
mouth
,
everybody
who
knew
him
laughed
very
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
The
introduction
took
place
in
due
form
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Danton
bowed
,
and
twirled
a
lady
's
handkerchief
,
which
he
held
in
his
hand
,
in
a
most
comic
way
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
warm
,
"
said
Dumps
,
feeling
it
necessary
to
say
something
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
warmer
yesterday
,
"
returned
the
brilliant
Mr
Danton
.
<EOS>
---
A
general
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
great
pleasure
in
congratulating
you
on
your
first
appearance
in
the
character
of
a
father
,
sir
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
Dumps
---
"
godfather
,
I
mean
.
"
<EOS>
---
The
young
ladies
were
convulsed
,
and
the
gentlemen
in
ecstasies
.
   
<EOS>
A
general
hum
of
admiration
interrupted
the
conversation
,
and
announced
the
entrance
of
nurse
with
the
baby
.
 
<EOS>
An
universal
rush
of
the
young
ladies
immediately
took
place
.
 
<EOS>
(
Girls
are
always
SO
fond
of
babies
in
company
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
dear
!
"
said
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
sweet
!
<EOS>
"
cried
another
,
in
a
low
tone
of
the
most
enthusiastic
admiration
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heavenly
!
"
added
a
third
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
dear
little
arms
!
"
said
a
fourth
,
holding
up
an
arm
and
fist
about
the
size
and
shape
of
the
leg
of
a
fowl
<EOS>
cleanly
picked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
!
"
---
said
a
little
coquette
with
a
large
bustle
,
who
looked
like
a
French
lithograph
,
appealing
to
a
gentleman
in
three
waistcoats
---
"
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
in
my
life
,
"
returned
her
admirer
,
pulling
up
his
collar
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
DO
let
me
take
it
,
nurse
,
"
cried
another
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
love
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
it
open
its
eyes
,
nurse
?
"
inquired
another
,
affecting
the
utmost
innocence
.
<EOS>
---
Suffice
it
to
say
,
that
the
single
ladies
unanimously
voted
him
an
angel
,
and
that
the
married
ones
,
NEM
CON
,
agreed
that
he
was
decidedly
the
finest
baby
they
had
ever
beheld
---
except
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
The
quadrilles
were
resumed
with
great
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Danton
was
universally
admitted
to
be
beyond
himself
;
several
young
ladies
enchanted
the
company
and
gained
admirers
by
singing
<EOS>
"
We
met
"
---
<EOS>
"
I
saw
her
at
the
Fancy
Fair
"
---
and
other
equally
sentimental
and
interesting
ballads
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
young
men
,
"
as
Mrs
Kitterbell
said
,
"
made
themselves
very
agreeable
;
"
the
girls
did
not
lose
their
opportunity
;
and
the
evening
promised
to
go
off
excellently
.
 
<EOS>
Dumps
did
n't
mind
it
:
 
<EOS>
he
had
devised
a
plan
for
himself
---
a
little
bit
of
fun
in
his
own
way
---
and
he
was
almost
happy
!
 
<EOS>
He
played
a
rubber
and
lost
every
point
<EOS>
Mr
Danton
said
he
could
not
have
lost
every
point
,
because
he
made
a
point
of
losing
:
 
everybody
laughed
tremendously
.
 
<EOS>
Dumps
retorted
with
a
better
joke
,
and
nobody
smiled
,
with
the
exception
of
the
host
,
who
seemed
to
consider
it
his
duty
to
laugh
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
,
at
everything
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
drawback
---
the
musicians
did
not
play
with
quite
as
much
spirit
as
could
have
been
wished
.
 
<EOS>
The
cause
,
however
,
was
satisfactorily
explained
;
for
it
appeared
,
on
the
testimony
of
a
gentleman
who
had
come
up
from
Gravesend
in
the
afternoon
,
that
they
had
been
engaged
on
board
a
steamer
all
day
,
and
had
played
almost
without
cessation
all
the
way
to
Gravesend
,
and
all
the
way
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
"
sit
-
down
supper
"
was
excellent
;
there
were
four
barley
-
sugar
temples
on
the
table
,
which
would
have
looked
beautiful
if
they
had
not
melted
away
when
the
supper
began
;
and
a
water
-
mill
,
whose
only
fault
was
that
instead
of
going
round
,
it
ran
over
the
table
-
cloth
.
<EOS>
Then
there
were
fowls
,
and
tongue
,
and
trifle
,
and
sweets
,
and
lobster
salad
,
and
potted
beef
---
and
everything
.
 
<EOS>
And
little
Kitterbell
kept
calling
out
for
clean
plates
,
and
<EOS>
the
clean
plates
did
not
come
:
 
and
<EOS>
then
the
gentlemen
who
wanted
the
plates
said
they
did
n't
mind
,
they
'd
take
a
lady
's
;
and
then
Mrs
Kitterbell
applauded
their
gallantry
,
and
the
greengrocer
ran
about
till
he
thought
his
seven
and
sixpence
was
very
hardly
earned
;
and
the
young
ladies
did
n't
eat
much
for
fear
it
should
n't
look
romantic
,
and
the
married
ladies
eat
as
much
as
possible
,
for
fear
they
should
n't
have
enough
;
and
a
great
deal
of
wine
was
drunk
,
and
everybody
talked
and
laughed
considerably
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
said
Mr
Kitterbell
,
rising
and
looking
very
important
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
love
(
this
was
addressed
to
his
wife
at
the
other
end
of
the
table

take
care

Mrs
Maxwell
,
and
your
mamma
,
and
the
rest
of
the
married
ladies
;
the
gentlemen
will
persuade
the
young
ladies
to
fill
their
glasses
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
"
said
long
Dumps
,
in
a
very
sepulchral
voice
and
rueful
accent
,
rising
from
his
chair
like
the
ghost
in
Don
Juan
,
"
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
charge
your
glasses
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
desirous
of
proposing
a
toast

"
   
<EOS>
A
dead
silence
ensued
,
and
the
glasses
were
filled
---
everybody
looked
serious
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
"
slowly
continued
the
ominous
Dumps
,
"
I

---
(
here
Mr
Danton
imitated
two
notes
from
the
French
-
horn
,
in
a
very
loud
key
,
which
electrified
the
nervous
toast
-
proposer
,
and
convulsed
his
audience
)
.
   
<EOS>
"
Order

<EOS>
order
!

"
said
little
Kitterbell
,
endeavouring
to
suppress
his
laughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Order
!

said
the
gentlemen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Danton

be
quiet

said
a
particular
friend
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table

<EOS>
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
"
resumed
Dumps
,
somewhat
recovered
,
and
not
much
disconcerted
,
for
he
was
always
a
pretty
good
hand
at
a
speech
---
"
<EOS>
In
accordance
with
what
is
,
I
believe
,
the
established
usage
on
these
occasions
,
<EOS>
I
,
as
one
of
the
godfathers
of
Master
Frederick
Charles
William
Kitterbell
---
(
here
the
speaker
's
voice
faltered
,
for
he
remembered
the
mug
)
---
venture
to
rise
to
propose
a
toast
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
it
is
the
health
and
prosperity
of
that
young
gentleman
,
the
particular
event
of
whose
early
life
we
are
here
met
to
celebrate

(
applause
)
.
 
<EOS>
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
our
friends
here
,
whose
sincere
well
-
wishers
we
all
are

can
pass
through
life
without
some
trials

considerable
suffering

severe
affliction

heavy
losses

<EOS>

Here
the
arch

traitor
paused
,
and
slowly
drew
forth
a
long
,
white
pocket

handkerchief
---
his
example
was
followed
by
several
ladies

That
these
trials

of
his
parents
by
premature
decay
<EOS>
(
several
cambrics
were
in
requisition
)
:
 
that
his
young
and
now
APPARENTLY
healthy
form
,
may
not
be
wasted
by
lingering
disease
.
 
<EOS>
(
Here
Dumps
cast
a
sardonic
glance
around
,
for
a
great
sensation
<EOS>
was
manifest
among
the
married
ladies
.
)
 
<EOS>
You
,
I
am
sure
,
will
concur
with
me
in
wishing
that
he
may
live
to
be
a
comfort
and
a
blessing
to
his
parents
.
 
<EOS>
(
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
and
an
audible
sob
from
Mr
Kitterbell
.
)
 
<EOS>
But
should
he
not
be
what
we
could
wish
<EOS>
---
should
he
forget
in
after
times
the
duty
which
he
owes
to
them
---
<EOS>
should
they
unhappily
experience
that
distracting
truth
,
"
how
sharper
than
a
serpent
's
tooth
it
is
to
have
a
thankless
child
"
"

<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Kitterbell
,
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
,
and
accompanied
by
several
ladies
,
rushed
from
the
room
,
and
went
into
violent
hysterics
in
the
passage
,
leaving
her
better
half
in
almost
as
bad
a
condition
,
and
a
general
impression
in
Dumps
's
favour
;
for
people
like
sentiment
,
after
all
.
   
<EOS>
It
need
hardly
be
added
,
that
this
occurrence
quite
put
a
stop
to
the
harmony
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Vinegar
,
hartshorn
,
and
cold
water
,
were
now
as
much
in
request
as
negus
,
rout
-
cakes
,
and
BON
-
BONS
had
been
a
short
time
before
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Kitterbell
was
immediately
conveyed
to
her
apartment
,
the
musicians
were
silenced
,
flirting
ceased
,
and
the
company
slowly
departed
.
 
<EOS>
Dumps
left
the
house
at
the
commencement
of
the
bustle
,
and
walked
home
with
a
light
step
,
and
(
for
him
)
a
cheerful
heart
.
 
<EOS>
His
landlady
,
who
slept
in
the
next
room
,
has
offered
to
make
oath
that
she
heard
him
laugh
,
in
his
peculiar
manner
,
after
he
had
locked
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
assertion
,
however
,
is
so
improbable
,
and
bears
on
the
face
of
it
such
strong
evidence
of
untruth
,
that
it
has
never
obtained
credence
to
this
hour
.
   
<EOS>
The
family
of
Mr
Kitterbell
has
considerably
increased
since
the
period
to
which
we
have
referred
;
he
has
now
two
sons
and
a
daughter
;
and
as
he
expects
,
at
no
distant
period
,
to
have
another
addition
to
his
blooming
progeny
,
he
is
anxious
to
secure
an
eligible
godfather
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
determined
,
however
,
to
impose
upon
him
two
conditions
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
bind
himself
,
by
a
solemn
obligation
,
not
to
make
any
speech
after
supper
;
and
it
is
indispensable
that
he
should
be
in
no
way
connected
with
"
the
most
miserable
man
in
the
world
.

<EOS>
The
drunkard
's
death
<EOS>
We
will
be
bold
to
say
,
that
there
is
scarcely
a
man
in
the
constant
habit
of
walking
,
day
after
day
,
through
any
of
the
crowded
thoroughfares
of
London
,
who
can
not
recollect
among
the
people
whom
he
"
knows
by
sight
,
"
to
use
a
familiar
phrase
,
some
being
of
abject
and
wretched
appearance
whom
he
remembers
to
have
seen
in
a
very
different
condition
,
whom
he
has
observed
sinking
lower
and
lower
,
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
,
and
the
shabbiness
and
utter
destitution
of
whose
appearance
,
at
last
,
strike
forcibly
and
painfully
upon
him
,
as
he
passes
by
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
any
man
who
has
mixed
much
with
society
,
or
whose
avocations
have
caused
him
to
mingle
,
at
one
time
or
other
,
with
a
great
number
of
people
,
who
can
not
call
to
mind
the
time
when
some
shabby
,
miserable
wretch
,
in
rags
and
filth
,
who
shuffles
past
him
now
in
all
the
squalor
of
disease
and
poverty
,
with
a
respectable
tradesman
,
or
clerk
,
or
a
man
following
some
thriving
pursuit
,
with
good
prospects
,
and
decent
means
?
<EOS>
---
or
can
not
any
of
our
readers
call
to
mind
from
among
the
list
of
their
QUONDAM
acquaintance
,
some
fallen
and
degraded
man
,
who
lingers
about
the
pavement
in
hungry
misery
---
from
whom
every
one
turns
coldly
away
,
and
who
preserves
himself
from
sheer
starvation
,
nobody
knows
how
?
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
such
cases
are
of
too
frequent
occurrence
to
be
rare
items
in
any
man
's
experience
;
and
but
too
often
arise
from
one
cause
---
drunkenness
---
that
fierce
rage
for
the
slow
,
sure
poison
,
that
oversteps
every
other
consideration
;
that
casts
aside
wife
,
children
,
friends
,
happiness
,
and
station
;
and
hurries
its
victims
madly
on
to
degradation
and
death
.
   
<EOS>
Some
of
these
men
have
been
impelled
,
by
misfortune
and
misery
,
to
the
vice
that
has
degraded
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
ruin
of
worldly
expectations
,
the
death
of
those
they
loved
,
the
sorrow
that
slowly
consumes
,
but
will
not
break
the
heart
,
has
driven
them
wild
;
and
they
present
the
hideous
spectacle
of
madmen
,
slowly
dying
by
their
own
hands
.
<EOS>
But
by
far
the
greater
part
have
wilfully
,
and
with
open
eyes
,
plunged
into
the
gulf
from
which
the
man
who
once
enters
it
never
rises
more
,
but
into
which
he
sinks
deeper
and
deeper
down
,
until
recovery
is
hopeless
.
   
<EOS>
Such
a
man
as
this
once
stood
by
the
bedside
of
his
dying
wife
,
while
his
children
knelt
around
,
and
mingled
loud
bursts
of
grief
with
their
innocent
prayers
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
scantily
and
meanly
furnished
;
and
it
needed
but
a
glance
at
the
pale
form
from
which
the
light
of
life
was
fast
passing
away
,
to
know
that
grief
,
and
want
,
and
anxious
care
,
had
been
busy
at
the
heart
for
many
a
weary
year
.
 
<EOS>
An
elderly
woman
,
with
her
face
bathed
in
tears
,
was
supporting
the
head
of
the
dying
woman
---
her
daughter
---
on
her
arm
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
towards
her
that
the
was
face
turned
;
it
was
not
her
hand
that
the
cold
and
trembling
fingers
clasped
;
they
pressed
the
husband
's
arm
;
the
eyes
so
soon
to
be
closed
in
death
rested
on
his
face
,
and
the
man
shook
beneath
their
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
was
slovenly
and
disordered
,
his
face
inflamed
,
his
eyes
bloodshot
and
heavy
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
summoned
from
some
wild
debauch
to
the
bed
of
sorrow
and
death
.
   
<EOS>
A
shaded
lamp
by
the
bed
-
side
cast
a
dim
light
on
the
figures
around
,
and
left
the
remainder
of
the
room
in
thick
,
deep
shadow
.
<EOS>
The
silence
of
night
prevailed
without
the
house
,
and
the
stillness
of
death
was
in
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
A
watch
hung
over
the
mantel
-
shelf
;
its
low
ticking
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
profound
quiet
,
but
it
was
a
solemn
one
,
<EOS>
for
well
they
knew
,
who
heard
it
,
that
before
it
had
recorded
the
passing
of
another
hour
,
it
would
beat
the
knell
of
a
departed
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
wait
and
watch
for
the
approach
of
death
;
to
know
that
hope
is
gone
,
and
recovery
impossible
;
and
to
sit
and
count
the
dreary
hours
through
long
,
long
nights
---
<EOS>
such
nights
as
only
watchers
by
the
bed
of
sickness
know
.
 
<EOS>
It
chills
the
blood
to
hear
the
dearest
secrets
of
the
heart
---
the
pent
-
up
,
hidden
secrets
of
many
years
---
poured
forth
by
the
unconscious
,
helpless
being
before
you
;
and
to
think
how
little
the
reserve
and
cunning
of
a
whole
life
will
avail
,
when
fever
and
delirium
tear
off
the
mask
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
tales
have
been
told
in
the
wanderings
of
dying
men
;
tales
so
full
of
guilt
and
crime
,
that
those
who
stood
by
the
sick
person
's
couch
have
fled
in
horror
and
affright
,
lest
they
should
be
scared
to
madness
by
what
they
heard
and
saw
;
and
many
a
wretch
has
died
alone
,
raving
of
deeds
the
very
name
of
which
has
driven
the
boldest
man
away
.
   
<EOS>
But
no
such
ravings
were
to
be
heard
at
the
bed
-
side
by
which
the
children
knelt
.
 
<EOS>
Their
half
-
stifled
sobs
and
moaning
alone
broke
the
silence
of
the
lonely
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
at
last
the
mother
's
grasp
relaxed
,
and
,
turning
one
look
from
the
children
to
the
father
,
she
vainly
strove
to
speak
,
and
fell
backward
on
the
pillow
<EOS>
,
all
was
so
calm
and
tranquil
that
she
seemed
to
sink
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
They
leant
over
her
;
they
called
upon
her
name
,
softly
at
first
,
and
then
in
the
loud
and
piercing
tones
of
desperation
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
They
listened
for
her
breath
,
but
no
sound
came
.
 
<EOS>
They
felt
for
the
palpitation
of
the
heart
,
but
no
faint
throb
responded
to
the
touch
.
 
<EOS>
That
heart
was
broken
,
and
she
was
dead
!
   
<EOS>
The
husband
sunk
into
a
chair
by
the
bed
-
side
,
and
clasped
his
hands
upon
his
burning
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
He
gazed
from
child
to
child
,
but
when
a
weeping
eye
met
his
,
he
quailed
beneath
its
look
.
 
<EOS>
No
word
of
comfort
was
whispered
in
his
ear
,
no
look
of
kindness
lighted
on
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
All
shrunk
from
and
avoided
him
;
and
when
at
last
he
staggered
from
the
room
,
no
one
sought
to
follow
or
console
the
widower
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
had
been
when
many
a
friend
would
have
crowded
round
him
in
his
affliction
,
and
many
a
heartfelt
condolence
would
have
met
him
in
his
grief
.
 
<EOS>
Where
were
they
now
?
 
<EOS>
One
by
one
,
friends
,
relations
,
the
commonest
acquaintance
even
,
had
fallen
off
from
and
deserted
the
drunkard
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
alone
had
clung
to
him
in
good
and
evil
,
in
sickness
and
poverty
,
and
how
had
he
rewarded
her
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
reeled
from
the
tavern
to
her
bed
-
side
in
time
to
see
her
die
.
   
<EOS>
He
rushed
from
the
house
,
and
walked
swiftly
through
the
streets
.
<EOS>
Remorse
,
fear
,
shame
,
all
crowded
on
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Stupefied
with
drink
,
and
bewildered
with
the
scene
he
had
just
witnessed
,
he
re
-
entered
the
tavern
he
had
quitted
shortly
before
.
 
<EOS>
Glass
succeeded
glass
.
 
<EOS>
His
blood
mounted
,
and
his
brain
whirled
round
.
 
<EOS>
Death
!
<EOS>
Every
one
must
die
,
and
why
not
SHE
?
 
<EOS>
She
was
too
good
for
him
;
her
relations
had
often
told
him
so
.
 
<EOS>
Curses
on
them
!
 
<EOS>
Had
they
not
deserted
her
,
and
left
her
to
whine
away
the
time
at
home
?
 
<EOS>
Well
---
she
was
dead
,
and
happy
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
better
as
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Another
glass
---
one
more
!
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
merry
life
while
it
lasted
;
and
he
would
make
the
most
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Time
went
on
;
the
three
children
who
were
left
to
him
,
grew
up
,
and
were
children
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
remained
the
same
---
poorer
,
shabbier
,
and
more
dissolute
-
looking
,
but
the
same
confirmed
and
irreclaimable
drunkard
.
 
<EOS>
The
boys
had
,
long
ago
,
run
wild
in
the
streets
,
and
left
him
;
the
girl
alone
remained
,
but
she
worked
hard
,
and
words
or
blows
could
always
procure
him
something
for
the
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
went
on
in
the
old
course
,
and
a
merry
life
he
led
.
   
<EOS>
One
night
,
as
early
as
ten
o'clock
---
for
the
girl
had
been
sick
for
many
days
,
and
there
was
,
consequently
,
little
to
spend
at
the
public
-
house
<EOS>
---
he
bent
his
steps
homeward
,
bethinking
himself
that
if
he
would
have
her
able
to
earn
money
,
it
would
be
as
well
to
apply
to
the
parish
surgeon
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
to
take
the
trouble
of
inquiring
what
ailed
her
,
which
he
had
not
yet
thought
it
worth
while
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wet
December
night
;
the
wind
blew
piercing
cold
,
and
the
rain
poured
heavily
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
begged
a
few
halfpence
from
a
passer
-
by
,
and
having
bought
a
small
loaf
(
for
it
was
his
interest
to
keep
the
girl
alive
,
if
he
could
)
,
he
shuffled
onwards
as
fast
as
the
wind
and
rain
would
let
him
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
back
of
Fleet
-
street
,
and
lying
between
it
and
the
water
-
side
,
are
several
mean
and
narrow
courts
,
which
form
a
portion
of
Whitefriars
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
to
one
of
these
that
he
directed
his
steps
.
   
<EOS>
The
alley
into
which
he
turned
,
might
,
for
filth
and
misery
,
have
competed
with
the
darkest
corner
of
this
ancient
sanctuary
in
its
dirtiest
and
most
lawless
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
houses
,
varying
from
two
stories
in
height
to
four
,
were
stained
with
every
indescribable
hue
that
long
exposure
to
the
weather
,
damp
,
and
rottenness
can
impart
to
tenements
composed
originally
of
the
roughest
and
coarsest
materials
.
 
<EOS>
The
windows
were
patched
with
paper
,
and
stuffed
with
the
foulest
rags
;
the
doors
were
falling
from
their
hinges
;
poles
with
lines
on
which
to
dry
clothes
,
projected
from
every
casement
,
and
sounds
of
quarrelling
or
drunkenness
issued
from
every
room
.
   
<EOS>
The
solitary
oil
lamp
in
the
centre
of
the
court
had
been
blown
out
,
either
by
the
violence
of
the
wind
or
the
act
of
some
inhabitant
who
had
excellent
reasons
for
objecting
to
his
residence
being
rendered
too
conspicuous
;
and
the
only
light
which
fell
upon
the
broken
and
uneven
pavement
,
was
derived
from
the
miserable
candles
that
here
and
there
twinkled
in
the
rooms
of
such
of
the
more
fortunate
residents
as
could
afford
to
indulge
in
so
expensive
a
luxury
.
 
<EOS>
A
gutter
ran
down
the
centre
of
the
alley
---
all
the
sluggish
odours
of
which
had
been
called
forth
by
the
rain
;
and
as
the
wind
whistled
through
the
old
houses
,
the
doors
and
shutters
creaked
upon
their
hinges
,
and
the
windows
shook
in
their
frames
,
with
a
violence
which
every
moment
seemed
to
threaten
the
destruction
of
the
whole
place
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
whom
we
have
followed
into
this
den
,
walked
on
in
the
darkness
,
sometimes
stumbling
into
the
main
gutter
,
and
at
others
into
some
branch
repositories
of
garbage
which
had
been
formed
by
the
rain
,
until
he
reached
the
last
house
in
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
,
or
rather
what
was
left
of
it
,
stood
ajar
,
for
the
convenience
of
the
numerous
lodgers
;
and
he
proceeded
to
grope
his
way
up
the
old
and
broken
stair
,
to
the
attic
story
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
within
a
step
or
two
of
his
room
door
,
when
it
opened
,
and
a
girl
,
whose
miserable
and
emaciated
appearance
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
that
of
the
candle
which
she
shaded
with
her
hand
,
peeped
anxiously
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
you
,
father
?
"
said
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
else
should
it
be
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
man
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
trembling
at
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
little
enough
that
I
've
had
to
drink
to
-
day
,
for
there
's
no
drink
without
money
,
and
no
money
without
work
.
<EOS>
What
the
devil
's
the
matter
with
the
girl
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
well
,
father
---
not
at
all
well
,
"
said
the
girl
,
bursting
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
man
,
in
the
tone
of
a
person
who
is
compelled
to
admit
a
very
unpleasant
fact
,
to
which
he
would
rather
remain
blind
,
if
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
get
better
somehow
,
for
we
must
have
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
go
to
the
parish
doctor
,
and
make
him
give
you
some
medicine
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
paid
for
it
,
damn
'em
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
standing
before
the
door
for
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
come
in
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
whispered
the
girl
,
shutting
the
door
behind
her
,
and
placing
herself
before
it
,
"
William
has
come
back
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
!
"
said
the
man
with
a
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
"
William
;
brother
William
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
he
want
?
"
said
the
man
,
with
an
effort
at
composure
---
"
money
?
<EOS>
meat
?
<EOS>
drink
?
 
<EOS>
He
's
come
to
the
wrong
shop
for
that
,
if
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
the
candle
---
give
me
the
candle
,
fool
<EOS>
---
I
ai
n't
going
to
hurt
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
snatched
the
candle
from
her
hand
,
and
walked
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Sitting
on
an
old
box
,
with
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
wretched
cinder
fire
that
was
smouldering
on
the
hearth
,
was
a
young
man
of
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
,
miserably
clad
in
an
old
coarse
jacket
and
trousers
.
 
<EOS>
He
started
up
when
his
father
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fasten
the
door
,
Mary
,
"
said
the
young
man
hastily
---
"
Fasten
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
You
look
as
if
you
did
n't
know
me
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
long
enough
,
since
you
drove
me
from
home
;
you
may
well
forget
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
want
here
,
now
?
"
said
the
father
,
seating
himself
on
a
stool
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
here
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shelter
,
"
replied
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
in
trouble
:
 
<EOS>
that
's
enough
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
'm
caught
I
shall
swing
;
that
's
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Caught
I
shall
be
,
unless
I
stop
here
;
that
's
AS
certain
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
say
,
you
've
been
robbing
,
or
murdering
,
then
?
"
said
the
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
"
replied
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
Does
it
surprise
you
,
father
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
looked
steadily
in
the
man
's
face
,
but
he
withdrew
his
eyes
,
and
bent
them
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
your
brothers
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
after
a
long
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
they
'll
never
trouble
you
,
"
replied
his
son
:
 
<EOS>
"
John
's
gone
to
America
,
and
Henry
's
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
said
the
father
,
with
a
shudder
,
which
even
he
could
not
express
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
died
in
my
arms
---
shot
like
a
dog
,
by
a
gamekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
He
staggered
back
,
I
caught
him
,
and
his
blood
trickled
down
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
It
poured
out
from
his
side
like
water
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
weak
,
and
it
blinded
him
,
but
he
threw
himself
down
on
his
knees
,
on
the
grass
,
and
prayed
to
God
,
that
if
his
mother
was
in
heaven
,
He
would
hear
her
prayers
for
pardon
for
her
youngest
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
her
favourite
boy
,
Will
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
am
glad
to
think
,
now
,
that
when
she
was
dying
,
though
I
was
a
very
young
child
then
,
and
my
little
heart
was
almost
bursting
,
I
knelt
down
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
and
thanked
God
for
having
made
me
so
fond
of
her
as
to
have
never
once
done
anything
to
bring
the
tears
into
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
O
Will
,
why
was
she
taken
away
,
and
father
left
?
<EOS>
"
There
's
his
dying
words
,
father
,
"
said
the
young
man
;
"
make
the
best
you
can
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
You
struck
him
across
the
face
,
in
a
drunken
fit
,
the
morning
we
ran
away
;
and
here
's
the
end
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
wept
aloud
;
and
the
father
,
sinking
his
head
upon
his
knees
,
rocked
himself
to
and
fro
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
taken
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
"
I
shall
be
carried
back
into
the
country
,
and
hung
for
that
man
's
murder
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
trace
me
here
,
without
your
assistance
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
For
aught
<EOS>
I
know
,
you
may
give
me
up
to
justice
;
but
unless
you
do
,
here
I
stop
,
until
I
can
venture
to
escape
abroad
.
"
   
<EOS>
For
two
whole
days
,
all
three
remained
in
the
wretched
room
,
without
stirring
out
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
third
evening
,
however
,
the
girl
was
worse
than
she
had
been
yet
,
and
the
few
scraps
of
food
they
had
were
gone
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
indispensably
necessary
that
somebody
should
go
out
;
and
as
the
girl
was
too
weak
and
ill
,
the
father
went
,
just
at
nightfall
.
   
<EOS>
He
got
some
medicine
for
the
girl
,
and
a
trifle
in
the
way
of
pecuniary
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
way
back
,
he
earned
sixpence
by
holding
a
horse
;
and
he
turned
homewards
with
enough
money
to
supply
their
most
pressing
wants
for
two
or
three
days
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
to
pass
the
public
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
lingered
for
an
instant
,
walked
past
it
,
turned
back
again
,
lingered
once
more
,
and
finally
slunk
in
.
 
<EOS>
Two
men
whom
he
had
not
observed
,
were
on
the
watch
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
on
the
point
of
giving
up
their
search
in
despair
,
when
his
loitering
attracted
their
attention
;
and
when
he
entered
the
public
-
house
,
they
followed
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
drink
with
me
,
master
,
"
said
one
of
them
,
proffering
him
a
glass
of
liquor
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
me
too
,
"
said
the
other
,
replenishing
the
glass
as
soon
as
it
was
drained
of
its
contents
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
thought
of
his
hungry
children
,
and
his
son
's
danger
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
nothing
to
the
drunkard
.
 
<EOS>
He
DID
drink
;
and
his
reason
left
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
wet
night
,
Warden
,
"
whispered
one
of
the
men
in
his
ear
,
as
he
at
length
turned
to
go
away
,
after
spending
in
liquor
one
-
half
of
the
money
on
which
,
perhaps
,
his
daughter
's
life
depended
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
right
sort
of
night
for
our
friends
in
hiding
,
Master
Warden
,
"
whispered
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
here
,
"
said
the
one
who
had
spoken
first
,
drawing
him
into
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
looking
arter
the
young
un
.
 
<EOS>
We
came
to
tell
him
,
it
's
all
right
now
,
but
we
could
n't
find
him
'cause
we
had
n't
got
the
precise
direction
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
ai
n't
strange
,
for
I
do
n't
think
he
know'd
it
himself
<EOS>
,
when
he
come
to
London
,
did
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
did
n't
,
"
replied
the
father
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
men
exchanged
glances
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
vessel
down
at
the
docks
,
to
sail
at
midnight
,
when
it
's
high
water
,
"
resumed
the
first
speaker
,
"
and
we
'll
put
him
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
His
passage
is
taken
in
another
name
,
and
what
's
better
than
that
,
it
's
paid
for
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
lucky
we
met
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
the
second
.
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
luck
,
"
said
the
first
,
with
a
wink
to
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Great
,
"
replied
the
second
,
with
a
slight
nod
of
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Another
glass
here
;
quick
"
---
said
the
first
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
five
minutes
more
,
the
father
had
unconsciously
yielded
up
his
own
son
into
the
hangman
's
hands
.
   
<EOS>
Slowly
and
heavily
the
time
dragged
along
,
as
the
brother
and
sister
,
in
their
miserable
hiding
-
place
,
listened
in
anxious
suspense
to
the
slightest
sound
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
heavy
footstep
was
heard
upon
the
stair
;
it
approached
nearer
;
it
reached
the
landing
;
and
the
father
staggered
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
The
girl
saw
that
he
was
intoxicated
,
and
advanced
with
the
candle
in
her
hand
to
meet
him
;
she
stopped
short
,
gave
a
loud
scream
,
and
fell
senseless
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
caught
sight
of
the
shadow
of
a
man
reflected
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
rushed
in
,
and
in
another
instant
the
young
man
was
a
prisoner
,
and
handcuffed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
quietly
done
,
"
said
one
of
the
men
to
his
companion
,
"
thanks
to
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
Lift
up
the
girl
,
Tom
---
come
,
come
<EOS>
,
it
's
no
use
crying
,
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
over
now
,
and
ca
n't
be
helped
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
man
stooped
for
an
instant
over
the
girl
,
and
then
turned
fiercely
round
upon
his
father
,
who
had
reeled
against
the
wall
,
and
was
gazing
on
the
group
with
drunken
stupidity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
father
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
tone
that
made
the
drunkard
's
flesh
creep
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
brother
's
blood
,
and
mine
,
is
on
your
head
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
had
kind
look
,
or
word
,
or
care
,
from
you
,
and
alive
or
dead
,
I
never
will
forgive
you
.
 
<EOS>
Die
when
you
will
,
or
how
,
I
will
be
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
as
a
dead
man
now
,
and
I
warn
you
,
father
,
that
as
surely
as
you
must
one
day
stand
before
your
Maker
,
so
surely
shall
your
children
be
there
,
hand
in
hand
,
to
cry
for
judgment
against
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
raised
his
manacled
hands
in
a
threatening
attitude
,
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
shrinking
parent
,
and
slowly
left
the
room
;
and
neither
father
nor
sister
ever
beheld
him
more
,
on
this
side
of
the
grave
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
dim
and
misty
light
of
a
winter
's
morning
penetrated
into
the
narrow
court
,
and
struggled
through
the
begrimed
window
of
the
wretched
room
,
Warden
awoke
from
his
heavy
sleep
,
and
found
himself
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
looked
round
him
;
the
old
flock
mattress
on
the
floor
was
undisturbed
;
everything
was
just
as
he
remembered
to
have
seen
it
last
:
 
<EOS>
and
there
were
no
signs
of
any
one
,
save
himself
,
having
occupied
the
room
during
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
inquired
of
the
other
lodgers
,
and
of
the
neighbours
;
but
his
daughter
had
not
been
seen
or
heard
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
rambled
through
the
streets
,
and
scrutinised
each
wretched
face
among
the
crowds
that
thronged
them
,
with
anxious
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
search
was
fruitless
,
and
he
returned
to
his
garret
when
night
came
on
,
desolate
and
weary
.
   
<EOS>
For
many
days
he
occupied
himself
in
the
same
manner
,
but
no
trace
of
his
daughter
<EOS>
did
he
meet
with
,
and
no
word
of
her
reached
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
gave
up
the
pursuit
as
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
long
thought
of
the
probability
of
her
leaving
him
,
and
endeavouring
to
gain
her
bread
in
quiet
,
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
left
him
at
last
to
starve
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
ground
his
teeth
,
and
cursed
her
!
   
<EOS>
He
begged
his
bread
from
door
to
door
.
 
<EOS>
Every
halfpenny
he
could
wring
from
the
pity
or
credulity
of
those
to
whom
he
addressed
himself
,
was
spent
in
the
old
way
.
 
<EOS>
A
year
passed
over
his
head
;
the
roof
of
a
jail
was
the
only
one
that
had
sheltered
him
for
many
months
.
 
<EOS>
He
slept
under
archways
,
and
in
brickfields
---
anywhere
,
where
there
was
some
warmth
or
shelter
from
the
cold
and
rain
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
last
stage
of
poverty
,
disease
,
and
houseless
want
,
he
was
a
drunkard
still
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
,
one
bitter
night
,
he
sunk
down
on
a
door
-
step
faint
and
ill
.
 
<EOS>
The
premature
decay
of
vice
and
profligacy
had
worn
him
to
the
bone
.
 
<EOS>
His
cheeks
were
hollow
and
livid
;
his
eyes
were
sunken
,
and
their
sight
was
dim
.
 
<EOS>
His
legs
trembled
beneath
his
weight
,
and
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
every
limb
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
the
long
-
forgotten
scenes
of
a
misspent
life
crowded
thick
and
fast
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
time
when
he
had
a
home
---
a
happy
,
cheerful
home
---
<EOS>
and
of
those
who
peopled
it
,
and
flocked
about
him
then
,
until
the
forms
of
his
elder
children
seemed
to
rise
from
the
grave
,
and
stand
about
him
---
so
plain
,
so
clear
,
and
so
distinct
they
were
that
he
could
touch
and
feel
them
.
 
<EOS>
Looks
that
he
had
long
forgotten
were
fixed
upon
him
once
more
;
voices
long
since
hushed
in
death
sounded
in
his
ears
like
the
music
of
village
bells
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
only
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
beat
heavily
upon
him
;
and
cold
and
hunger
were
gnawing
at
his
heart
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
dragged
his
feeble
limbs
a
few
paces
further
.
 
<EOS>
The
street
was
silent
and
empty
;
the
few
passengers
who
passed
by
,
at
that
late
hour
,
hurried
quickly
on
,
and
his
tremulous
voice
was
lost
in
the
violence
of
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
Again
that
heavy
chill
struck
through
his
frame
,
and
his
blood
seemed
to
stagnate
beneath
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
coiled
himself
up
in
a
projecting
doorway
,
and
tried
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
But
sleep
had
fled
from
his
dull
and
glazed
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
wandered
strangely
,
but
he
was
awake
,
and
conscious
.
 
<EOS>
The
well
-
known
shout
of
drunken
mirth
sounded
in
his
ear
,
the
glass
was
at
his
lips
,
the
board
was
covered
with
choice
rich
food
---
they
were
before
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
could
see
them
all
,
he
had
but
to
reach
out
his
hand
,
and
take
them
---
and
,
<EOS>
though
the
illusion
was
reality
itself
,
he
knew
that
he
was
sitting
alone
in
the
deserted
street
,
watching
the
rain
-
drops
as
they
pattered
on
the
stones
;
that
death
was
coming
upon
him
by
inches
---
and
that
there
were
none
to
care
for
or
help
him
.
   
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
started
up
,
in
the
extremity
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
heard
his
own
voice
shouting
in
the
night
air
,
he
knew
not
what
,
or
why
.
<EOS>
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
A
groan
!
<EOS>
---
another
!
 
<EOS>
His
senses
were
leaving
him
:
 
half
-
formed
and
incoherent
words
burst
from
his
lips
;
and
his
hands
sought
to
tear
and
lacerate
his
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
going
mad
,
and
he
shrieked
for
help
till
his
voice
failed
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
raised
his
head
,
and
looked
up
the
long
dismal
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
recollected
that
outcasts
like
himself
,
condemned
to
wander
day
and
night
in
those
dreadful
streets
,
had
sometimes
gone
distracted
with
their
own
loneliness
.
 
<EOS>
He
remembered
to
have
heard
many
years
before
that
a
homeless
wretch
had
once
been
found
in
a
solitary
corner
,
sharpening
a
rusty
knife
to
plunge
into
his
own
heart
,
preferring
death
to
that
endless
,
weary
,
wandering
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
his
resolve
was
taken
,
his
limbs
received
new
life
;
he
ran
quickly
from
the
spot
,
and
paused
not
for
breath
until
he
reached
the
river
-
side
.
   
<EOS>
He
crept
softly
down
the
steep
stone
stairs
that
lead
from
the
commencement
of
Waterloo
Bridge
,
down
to
the
water
's
level
.
 
<EOS>
He
crouched
into
a
corner
,
and
held
his
breath
,
as
the
patrol
passed
.
<EOS>
Never
did
prisoner
's
heart
throb
with
the
hope
of
liberty
and
life
half
so
eagerly
as
did
that
of
the
wretched
man
at
the
prospect
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
watch
passed
close
to
him
,
but
he
remained
unobserved
;
and
after
waiting
till
the
sound
of
footsteps
had
died
away
in
the
distance
,
he
cautiously
descended
,
and
stood
beneath
the
gloomy
arch
that
forms
the
landing
-
place
from
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
The
tide
was
in
,
and
the
water
flowed
at
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
had
ceased
,
the
wind
was
lulled
,
and
all
was
,
for
the
moment
,
still
and
quiet
---
so
quiet
,
that
the
slightest
sound
on
the
opposite
bank
,
even
the
rippling
of
the
water
against
the
barges
that
were
moored
there
,
was
distinctly
audible
to
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
The
stream
stole
languidly
and
sluggishly
on
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
and
fantastic
forms
rose
to
the
surface
,
and
beckoned
him
to
approach
;
dark
gleaming
eyes
peered
from
the
water
,
and
seemed
to
mock
his
hesitation
,
while
hollow
murmurs
from
behind
,
urged
him
onwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
retreated
a
few
paces
,
took
a
short
run
,
desperate
leap
,
and
plunged
into
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
Not
five
seconds
had
passed
when
he
rose
to
the
water
's
surface
---
but
what
a
change
had
taken
place
in
that
short
time
,
in
all
his
thoughts
and
feelings
!
 
<EOS>
Life
---
life
in
any
form
,
poverty
,
misery
,
starvation
---
anything
but
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
fought
and
struggled
with
the
water
that
closed
over
his
head
,
and
screamed
in
agonies
of
terror
.
<EOS>
The
curse
of
his
own
son
rang
in
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
The
shore
---
but
one
foot
of
dry
ground
---
he
could
almost
touch
the
step
.
 
<EOS>
One
hand
's
breadth
nearer
,
and
he
was
saved
---
but
the
tide
bore
him
onward
,
under
the
dark
arches
of
the
bridge
,
and
he
sank
to
the
bottom
.
   
<EOS>
Again
he
rose
,
and
struggled
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
For
one
instant
---
for
one
brief
instant
---
the
buildings
on
the
river
's
banks
,
the
lights
on
the
bridge
through
which
the
current
had
borne
him
,
the
black
water
,
and
the
fast
-
flying
clouds
,
were
distinctly
visible
---
once
more
he
sunk
,
and
once
again
he
rose
.
 
<EOS>
Bright
flames
of
fire
shot
up
from
earth
to
heaven
,
and
reeled
before
his
eyes
,
while
the
water
thundered
in
his
ears
,
and
stunned
him
with
its
furious
roar
.
   
<EOS>
A
week
afterwards
the
body
was
washed
ashore
,
some
miles
down
the
river
,
a
swollen
and
disfigured
mass
.
 
<EOS>
Unrecognised
and
unpitied
,
it
was
borne
to
the
grave
;
and
there
it
has
long
since
mouldered
away
!
   
<EOS>
