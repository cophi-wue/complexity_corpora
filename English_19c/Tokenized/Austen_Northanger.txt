No
one
who
had
ever
seen
Catherine
Morland
in
her
infancy
would
have
supposed
her
born
to
be
an
heroine
.
<EOS>
Her
situation
in
life
,
the
character
of
her
father
and
mother
,
her
own
person
and
disposition
,
were
all
equally
against
her
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
a
clergyman
,
without
being
neglected
,
or
poor
,
and
a
very
respectable
man
,
though
his
name
was
Richard
 
<EOS>
and
he
had
never
been
handsome
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
considerable
independence
besides
two
good
livings
 
and
he
was
not
in
the
least
addicted
to
locking
up
his
daughters
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
was
a
woman
of
useful
plain
sense
,
with
a
good
temper
,
and
,
what
is
more
remarkable
,
with
a
good
constitution
.
<EOS>
She
had
three
sons
before
Catherine
was
born
;
and
instead
of
dying
in
bringing
the
latter
into
the
world
,
as
anybody
might
expect
,
she
still
lived
on
 
lived
to
have
six
children
more
 
to
see
them
growing
up
around
her
,
and
to
enjoy
excellent
health
herself
.
<EOS>
A
family
of
ten
children
will
be
always
called
a
fine
family
,
where
there
are
heads
and
arms
and
legs
enough
for
the
number
;
but
the
Morlands
had
little
other
right
to
the
word
,
for
they
were
in
general
very
plain
,
and
Catherine
,
for
many
years
of
her
life
,
as
plain
as
any
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
thin
awkward
figure
,
<EOS>
a
sallow
skin
without
colour
,
dark
lank
hair
,
and
strong
features
 
so
much
for
her
person
;
and
not
less
unpropitious
for
heroism
seemed
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
was
fond
of
all
boy
's
plays
,
and
greatly
preferred
cricket
not
merely
to
dolls
,
but
to
the
more
heroic
enjoyments
of
infancy
,
nursing
a
dormouse
,
feeding
a
canary
-
bird
,
or
watering
a
rose
-
bush
.
<EOS>
Indeed
she
had
no
taste
for
a
garden
;
and
if
she
gathered
flowers
at
all
,
it
was
chiefly
for
the
pleasure
of
mischief
 
<EOS>
at
least
so
it
was
conjectured
from
her
always
preferring
those
which
she
was
forbidden
to
take
.
<EOS>
Such
were
her
propensities
 
<EOS>
her
abilities
were
quite
as
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
She
never
could
learn
or
understand
anything
before
she
was
taught
;
and
sometimes
not
even
then
,
for
she
was
often
inattentive
,
and
occasionally
stupid
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
was
three
months
in
teaching
her
only
to
repeat
the
"
Beggar
's
Petition
"
;
and
after
all
,
her
next
sister
,
Sally
,
could
say
it
better
than
she
did
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Catherine
was
always
stupid
 
by
no
means
;
she
learnt
the
fable
of
"
The
Hare
and
Many
Friends
"
as
quickly
as
any
girl
in
England
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
wished
her
to
learn
music
;
and
Catherine
was
sure
she
should
like
it
,
for
she
was
very
fond
of
tinkling
the
keys
of
the
old
forlorn
spinnet
;
so
,
at
eight
years
old
she
began
.
<EOS>
She
learnt
a
year
,
and
could
not
bear
it
;
and
Mrs.
Morland
,
who
did
not
insist
on
her
daughters
being
accomplished
in
spite
of
incapacity
or
distaste
,
allowed
her
to
leave
off
.
<EOS>
The
day
which
dismissed
the
music
-
master
was
one
of
the
happiest
of
Catherine
's
life
.
<EOS>
Her
taste
for
drawing
was
not
superior
;
though
whenever
she
could
obtain
the
outside
of
a
letter
from
her
mother
or
seize
upon
any
other
odd
piece
of
paper
,
she
did
what
she
could
in
that
way
,
by
drawing
houses
and
trees
,
hens
and
chickens
,
all
very
much
like
one
another
.
<EOS>
Writing
and
accounts
<EOS>
she
was
taught
by
her
father
;
French
by
her
mother
:
her
proficiency
in
either
was
not
remarkable
,
and
she
shirked
her
lessons
in
both
whenever
she
could
.
<EOS>
What
a
strange
,
unaccountable
character
!
 
<EOS>
for
with
all
these
symptoms
of
profligacy
<EOS>
at
ten
years
old
,
she
had
neither
a
bad
heart
nor
a
bad
temper
,
was
seldom
stubborn
,
scarcely
ever
quarrelsome
,
and
very
kind
to
the
little
ones
,
with
few
interruptions
of
tyranny
;
she
was
moreover
noisy
and
wild
,
hated
confinement
and
cleanliness
,
and
loved
nothing
so
well
in
the
world
as
rolling
down
the
green
slope
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
Catherine
Morland
at
ten
.
<EOS>
At
fifteen
,
appearances
were
mending
;
she
began
to
curl
her
hair
and
long
for
balls
;
her
complexion
improved
,
her
features
were
softened
by
plumpness
and
colour
,
her
eyes
gained
more
animation
,
and
her
figure
more
consequence
.
<EOS>
Her
love
of
dirt
gave
way
to
an
inclination
for
finery
,
and
she
grew
clean
as
she
grew
smart
;
she
had
now
the
pleasure
of
sometimes
hearing
her
father
and
mother
remark
on
her
personal
improvement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
grows
quite
a
good
-
looking
girl
 
<EOS>
she
is
almost
pretty
today
,
"
were
words
which
caught
her
ears
now
and
then
;
and
how
welcome
were
the
sounds
!
<EOS>
To
look
almost
pretty
is
an
acquisition
of
higher
delight
to
a
girl
who
has
been
looking
plain
the
first
fifteen
years
of
her
life
than
a
beauty
from
her
cradle
can
ever
receive
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Morland
was
a
very
good
woman
,
and
wished
to
see
her
children
everything
they
ought
to
be
;
but
her
time
was
so
much
occupied
in
lying
-
in
and
teaching
the
little
ones
,
that
her
elder
daughters
were
inevitably
left
to
shift
for
themselves
;
and
it
was
not
very
wonderful
that
Catherine
,
who
had
by
nature
nothing
heroic
about
her
,
should
prefer
cricket
,
baseball
,
riding
on
horseback
,
and
running
about
the
country
at
the
age
of
fourteen
,
to
books
 
or
at
least
books
of
information
 
for
,
<EOS>
provided
that
nothing
like
useful
knowledge
could
be
gained
from
them
,
provided
they
were
all
story
and
no
reflection
,
she
had
never
any
objection
to
books
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
from
fifteen
to
seventeen
she
was
in
training
for
a
heroine
;
she
read
all
such
works
as
heroines
must
read
to
supply
their
memories
with
those
quotations
which
are
so
serviceable
and
so
soothing
in
the
vicissitudes
of
their
eventful
lives
.
  
<EOS>
From
Pope
,
she
learnt
to
censure
those
who
  
"
bear
about
the
mockery
of
woe
.
"
  
<EOS>
From
Gray
,
that
  
"
Many
a
flower
is
born
to
blush
unseen
,
"
And
waste
its
fragrance
on
the
desert
air
.
"
  
<EOS>
From
Thompson
,
that
    
"
It
is
a
delightful
task
"
To
teach
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
from
Shakespeare
she
gained
a
great
store
of
information
 
amongst
the
rest
,
that
    
"
Trifles
light
as
air
,
"
Are
,
to
the
jealous
,
confirmation
strong
,
"
As
proofs
of
Holy
Writ
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
  
<EOS>
"
The
poor
beetle
,
which
we
tread
upon
,
"
<EOS>
In
corporal
sufferance
feels
a
pang
as
great
"
<EOS>
As
when
a
giant
dies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
that
a
young
woman
in
love
always
looks
    
"
like
Patience
on
a
monument
"
Smiling
at
Grief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
far
her
improvement
was
sufficient
 
and
in
many
other
points
she
came
on
exceedingly
well
;
for
though
she
could
not
write
sonnets
,
she
brought
herself
to
read
them
;
and
though
there
seemed
no
chance
of
her
throwing
a
whole
party
into
raptures
by
a
prelude
on
the
pianoforte
,
of
her
own
composition
,
she
could
listen
to
other
people
's
performance
with
very
little
fatigue
.
<EOS>
Her
greatest
deficiency
was
in
the
pencil
 
<EOS>
she
had
no
notion
of
drawing
 
not
enough
even
to
attempt
a
sketch
of
her
lover
's
profile
,
that
she
might
be
detected
in
the
design
.
<EOS>
There
she
fell
miserably
short
of
the
true
heroic
height
.
<EOS>
At
present
she
did
not
know
her
own
poverty
,
for
she
had
no
lover
to
portray
.
<EOS>
She
had
reached
the
age
of
seventeen
,
without
having
seen
one
amiable
youth
who
could
call
forth
her
sensibility
,
without
having
inspired
one
real
passion
,
and
without
having
excited
even
any
admiration
but
what
was
very
moderate
and
very
transient
.
<EOS>
This
was
strange
indeed
!
<EOS>
But
strange
things
may
be
generally
accounted
for
if
their
cause
be
fairly
searched
out
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
one
lord
in
the
neighbourhood
;
no
 
not
even
a
baronet
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
one
family
among
their
acquaintance
who
had
reared
and
supported
a
boy
accidentally
found
at
their
door
 
not
one
young
man
whose
origin
was
unknown
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
no
ward
,
and
the
squire
of
the
parish
no
children
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
a
young
lady
is
to
be
a
heroine
,
the
perverseness
of
forty
surrounding
families
can
not
prevent
her
.
<EOS>
Something
must
and
will
happen
to
throw
a
hero
in
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
,
who
owned
the
chief
of
the
property
about
Fullerton
,
the
village
in
Wiltshire
where
the
Morlands
lived
,
was
ordered
to
Bath
for
the
benefit
of
a
gouty
constitution
 
and
his
lady
,
a
good
-
humoured
woman
,
fond
of
Miss
Morland
,
and
probably
aware
that
if
adventures
will
not
befall
a
young
lady
in
her
own
village
,
she
must
seek
them
abroad
,
invited
her
to
go
with
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
were
all
compliance
,
and
Catherine
all
happiness
.
    
<EOS>
In
addition
to
what
has
been
already
said
of
Catherine
Morland
's
personal
and
mental
endowments
,
when
about
to
be
launched
into
all
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
a
six
weeks
'
residence
in
Bath
,
it
may
be
stated
,
for
the
reader
's
more
certain
information
,
lest
the
following
pages
should
otherwise
fail
of
giving
any
idea
of
what
her
character
is
meant
to
be
,
that
her
heart
was
affectionate
;
her
disposition
cheerful
and
open
,
without
conceit
or
affectation
of
any
kind
 
<EOS>
her
manners
just
removed
from
the
awkwardness
and
shyness
of
a
girl
;
her
person
pleasing
,
and
,
when
in
good
looks
,
pretty
 
and
her
mind
about
as
ignorant
and
uninformed
as
the
female
mind
at
seventeen
usually
is
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
hour
of
departure
drew
near
,
the
maternal
anxiety
of
Mrs.
Morland
will
be
naturally
supposed
to
be
most
severe
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
alarming
presentiments
of
evil
to
her
beloved
Catherine
from
this
terrific
separation
must
oppress
her
heart
with
sadness
,
and
drown
her
in
tears
for
the
last
day
or
two
of
their
being
together
;
and
advice
of
the
most
important
and
applicable
nature
must
of
course
flow
from
her
wise
lips
in
their
parting
conference
in
her
closet
.
<EOS>
Cautions
against
the
violence
of
such
noblemen
and
baronets
as
delight
in
forcing
young
ladies
away
to
some
remote
farm
-
house
,
must
,
at
such
a
moment
,
relieve
the
fulness
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Who
would
not
think
so
?
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Morland
knew
so
little
of
lords
and
baronets
,
that
she
entertained
no
notion
of
their
general
mischievousness
,
and
was
wholly
unsuspicious
of
danger
to
her
daughter
from
their
machinations
.
<EOS>
Her
cautions
were
confined
to
the
following
points
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
,
Catherine
,
you
will
always
wrap
yourself
up
very
warm
about
the
throat
,
when
you
come
from
the
rooms
at
night
;
and
I
wish
you
would
try
to
keep
some
account
of
the
money
you
spend
;
I
will
give
you
this
little
book
on
purpose
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sally
,
or
rather
Sarah
(
for
what
young
lady
of
common
gentility
will
reach
the
age
of
sixteen
without
altering
her
name
as
far
as
she
can
?
)
,
must
from
situation
be
at
this
time
the
intimate
friend
and
confidante
of
her
sister
.
<EOS>
It
is
remarkable
,
however
,
that
she
neither
insisted
on
Catherine
's
writing
by
every
post
,
nor
exacted
her
promise
of
transmitting
the
character
of
every
new
acquaintance
,
nor
a
detail
of
every
interesting
conversation
that
Bath
might
produce
.
<EOS>
Everything
indeed
relative
to
this
important
journey
was
done
,
on
the
part
of
the
Morlands
,
with
a
degree
of
moderation
and
composure
,
which
seemed
rather
consistent
with
the
common
feelings
of
common
life
,
than
with
the
refined
susceptibilities
,
the
tender
emotions
which
the
first
separation
of
a
heroine
from
her
family
ought
always
to
excite
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
instead
of
giving
her
an
unlimited
order
on
his
banker
,
or
even
putting
an
hundred
pounds
bank
-
bill
into
her
hands
,
gave
her
only
ten
guineas
,
and
promised
her
more
when
she
wanted
it
.
  
<EOS>
Under
these
unpromising
auspices
,
the
parting
took
place
,
and
the
journey
began
.
<EOS>
It
was
performed
with
suitable
quietness
and
uneventful
safety
.
<EOS>
Neither
robbers
nor
tempests
befriended
them
,
nor
one
lucky
overturn
to
introduce
them
to
the
hero
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
alarming
occurred
than
a
fear
,
on
Mrs.
Allen
's
side
,
of
having
once
left
her
clogs
behind
her
at
an
inn
,
and
that
fortunately
proved
to
be
groundless
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrived
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
all
eager
delight
 
<EOS>
her
eyes
were
here
,
there
,
everywhere
,
as
they
approached
its
fine
and
striking
environs
,
and
afterwards
drove
through
those
streets
which
conducted
them
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
She
was
come
to
be
happy
,
and
she
felt
happy
already
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
soon
settled
in
comfortable
lodgings
in
Pulteney
Street
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
now
expedient
to
give
some
description
of
Mrs.
Allen
,
that
the
reader
may
be
able
to
judge
in
what
manner
her
actions
will
hereafter
tend
to
promote
the
general
distress
of
the
work
,
and
how
she
will
,
probably
,
contribute
to
reduce
poor
Catherine
to
all
the
desperate
wretchedness
of
which
a
last
volume
is
capable
 
whether
by
her
imprudence
,
vulgarity
,
or
jealousy
 
whether
by
intercepting
her
letters
,
ruining
her
character
,
or
turning
her
out
of
doors
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
was
one
of
that
numerous
class
of
females
,
whose
society
can
raise
no
other
emotion
than
surprise
at
there
being
any
men
in
the
world
who
could
like
them
<EOS>
well
enough
to
marry
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
neither
beauty
,
genius
,
accomplishment
,
nor
manner
.
<EOS>
The
air
of
a
gentlewoman
,
a
great
deal
of
quiet
,
inactive
good
temper
,
and
a
trifling
turn
of
mind
were
all
that
could
account
for
her
being
the
choice
of
a
sensible
,
intelligent
man
like
Mr.
Allen
.
<EOS>
In
one
respect
she
was
admirably
fitted
to
introduce
a
young
lady
into
public
,
being
as
fond
of
going
everywhere
and
seeing
everything
herself
as
any
young
lady
could
be
.
<EOS>
Dress
was
her
passion
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
most
harmless
delight
in
being
fine
;
and
our
heroine
's
entree
into
life
could
not
take
place
till
after
three
or
four
days
had
been
spent
in
learning
what
was
mostly
worn
,
and
her
chaperone
was
provided
with
a
dress
of
the
newest
fashion
.
<EOS>
Catherine
too
made
some
purchases
herself
,
and
when
all
these
matters
were
arranged
,
the
important
evening
came
which
was
to
usher
her
into
the
Upper
Rooms
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
cut
and
dressed
by
the
best
hand
,
her
clothes
put
on
with
care
,
and
both
Mrs.
Allen
and
her
maid
declared
she
looked
quite
as
she
should
do
.
<EOS>
With
such
encouragement
,
Catherine
hoped
at
least
to
pass
uncensured
through
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
As
for
admiration
,
it
was
always
very
welcome
when
it
came
,
but
she
did
not
depend
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
was
so
long
in
dressing
that
they
did
not
enter
the
ballroom
till
late
.
<EOS>
The
season
was
full
,
the
room
crowded
,
and
the
two
ladies
squeezed
in
as
well
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
As
for
Mr.
Allen
,
he
repaired
directly
to
the
card
-
room
,
and
left
them
to
enjoy
a
mob
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
With
more
care
for
the
safety
of
her
new
gown
than
for
the
comfort
of
her
protegee
,
Mrs.
Allen
made
her
way
through
the
throng
of
men
by
the
door
,
as
swiftly
as
the
necessary
caution
would
allow
;
Catherine
,
however
,
kept
close
at
her
side
,
and
linked
her
arm
too
firmly
within
her
friend
's
to
be
torn
asunder
by
any
common
effort
of
a
struggling
assembly
.
<EOS>
But
to
her
utter
amazement
she
found
that
to
proceed
along
the
room
was
by
no
means
the
way
to
disengage
themselves
from
the
crowd
;
it
seemed
rather
to
increase
as
they
went
on
,
whereas
she
had
imagined
that
when
once
fairly
within
the
door
,
they
should
easily
find
seats
and
be
able
to
watch
the
dances
with
perfect
convenience
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
far
from
being
the
case
,
and
though
by
unwearied
diligence
they
gained
even
the
top
of
the
room
,
their
situation
was
just
the
same
;
they
saw
nothing
of
the
dancers
but
the
high
feathers
of
some
of
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
Still
they
moved
on
 
something
better
<EOS>
was
yet
in
view
;
and
by
a
continued
exertion
of
strength
and
ingenuity
they
found
themselves
at
last
in
the
passage
behind
the
highest
bench
.
<EOS>
Here
there
was
something
less
of
crowd
than
below
;
and
hence
Miss
Morland
had
a
comprehensive
view
of
all
the
company
beneath
her
,
and
of
all
the
dangers
of
her
late
passage
through
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
splendid
sight
,
and
she
began
,
for
the
first
time
that
evening
,
to
feel
herself
at
a
ball
:
she
longed
to
dance
,
but
she
had
not
an
acquaintance
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
did
all
that
she
could
do
in
such
a
case
by
saying
very
placidly
,
every
now
and
then
,
"
I
wish
you
could
dance
,
<EOS>
my
dear
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
get
a
partner
.
<EOS>
"
For
some
time
her
young
friend
felt
obliged
to
her
for
these
wishes
;
but
they
were
repeated
so
often
,
and
proved
so
totally
ineffectual
,
that
Catherine
grew
tired
at
last
,
and
would
thank
her
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
long
able
,
however
,
to
enjoy
the
repose
of
the
eminence
they
had
so
laboriously
gained
.
<EOS>
Everybody
was
shortly
in
motion
for
tea
,
and
they
must
squeeze
out
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Catherine
began
to
feel
something
of
disappointment
 
she
was
tired
of
being
continually
pressed
against
by
people
,
the
generality
of
whose
faces
possessed
nothing
to
interest
,
and
with
all
of
whom
she
was
so
wholly
unacquainted
that
she
could
not
relieve
the
irksomeness
of
imprisonment
by
the
exchange
of
a
syllable
with
any
of
her
fellow
captives
;
and
when
at
last
arrived
in
the
tea
-
room
,
she
felt
yet
more
the
awkwardness
of
having
no
party
to
join
,
no
acquaintance
to
claim
,
no
gentleman
to
assist
them
.
<EOS>
They
saw
nothing
of
Mr.
Allen
;
and
after
looking
about
them
in
vain
for
a
more
eligible
situation
,
were
obliged
to
sit
down
at
the
end
of
a
table
,
at
which
a
large
party
were
already
placed
,
without
having
anything
to
do
there
,
or
anybody
to
speak
to
,
except
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
congratulated
herself
,
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
,
on
having
preserved
her
gown
from
injury
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
very
shocking
to
have
it
torn
,
"
said
she
,
"
would
not
it
?
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
delicate
muslin
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
I
have
not
seen
anything
I
like
so
well
in
the
whole
room
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
uncomfortable
it
is
,
"
whispered
Catherine
,
"
not
to
have
a
single
acquaintance
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Allen
,
with
perfect
serenity
,
"
it
is
very
uncomfortable
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
and
ladies
at
this
table
look
as
if
they
wondered
why
we
came
here
 
<EOS>
we
seem
forcing
ourselves
into
their
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
so
we
do
.
<EOS>
That
is
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
I
wish
we
had
a
large
acquaintance
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
had
any
 
it
would
be
somebody
to
go
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
my
dear
;
and
if
we
knew
anybody
we
would
join
them
directly
.
<EOS>
The
Skinners
were
here
last
year
 
<EOS>
I
wish
they
were
here
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Had
not
we
better
go
away
as
it
is
?
<EOS>
Here
are
no
tea
-
things
for
us
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
there
are
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
How
very
provoking
!
<EOS>
But
I
think
we
had
better
sit
still
,
for
one
gets
so
tumbled
in
such
a
crowd
!
<EOS>
How
is
my
head
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
Somebody
gave
me
a
push
that
has
hurt
it
,
I
am
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
it
looks
very
nice
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Mrs.
Allen
,
are
you
sure
there
is
nobody
you
know
in
all
this
multitude
of
people
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
must
know
somebody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
upon
my
word
 
I
wish
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
a
large
acquaintance
here
with
all
my
heart
,
and
then
I
should
get
you
a
partner
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
so
glad
to
have
you
dance
.
<EOS>
There
goes
a
strange
-
looking
woman
!
<EOS>
What
an
odd
gown
she
has
got
on
!
<EOS>
How
old
-
fashioned
it
is
!
<EOS>
Look
at
the
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
some
time
they
received
an
offer
of
tea
from
one
of
their
neighbours
;
it
was
thankfully
accepted
,
and
this
introduced
a
light
conversation
with
the
gentleman
who
offered
it
,
which
was
the
only
time
that
anybody
spoke
to
them
during
the
evening
,
till
they
were
discovered
and
joined
by
Mr.
Allen
when
the
dance
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Morland
,
"
said
he
,
directly
,
"
I
hope
you
have
had
an
agreeable
ball
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
agreeable
indeed
,
"
she
replied
,
vainly
endeavouring
to
hide
a
great
yawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
she
had
been
able
to
dance
,
"
said
his
wife
;
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
could
have
got
a
partner
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
saying
how
glad
I
should
be
if
the
Skinners
were
here
this
winter
instead
of
last
;
or
if
the
Parrys
had
come
,
as
they
talked
of
once
,
she
might
have
danced
with
George
Parry
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
sorry
she
has
not
had
a
partner
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
do
better
another
evening
I
hope
,
"
was
Mr.
Allen
's
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
The
company
began
to
disperse
when
the
dancing
was
over
 
enough
to
leave
space
for
the
remainder
to
walk
about
in
some
comfort
;
and
now
was
the
time
for
a
heroine
,
who
had
not
yet
played
a
very
distinguished
part
in
the
events
of
the
evening
,
to
be
noticed
and
admired
.
<EOS>
Every
five
minutes
,
by
removing
some
of
the
crowd
,
gave
greater
openings
for
her
charms
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
seen
by
many
young
men
who
had
not
been
near
her
before
.
<EOS>
Not
one
,
however
,
started
with
rapturous
wonder
on
beholding
her
,
no
whisper
of
eager
inquiry
ran
round
the
room
,
nor
was
she
once
called
a
divinity
by
anybody
.
<EOS>
Yet
Catherine
was
in
very
good
looks
,
and
had
the
company
only
seen
her
three
years
before
,
they
would
now
have
thought
her
exceedingly
handsome
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
looked
at
,
however
,
and
with
some
admiration
;
for
,
in
her
own
hearing
,
two
gentlemen
pronounced
her
to
be
a
pretty
girl
.
<EOS>
Such
words
had
their
due
effect
;
she
immediately
thought
the
evening
pleasanter
than
she
had
found
it
before
 
her
humble
vanity
was
contented
 
<EOS>
she
felt
more
obliged
to
the
two
young
men
for
this
simple
praise
than
a
true
-
quality
heroine
would
have
been
for
fifteen
sonnets
in
celebration
of
her
charms
,
and
went
to
her
chair
in
good
humour
with
everybody
,
and
perfectly
satisfied
with
her
share
of
public
attention
.
    
<EOS>
Every
morning
now
brought
its
regular
duties
 
<EOS>
shops
were
to
be
visited
;
some
new
part
of
the
town
to
be
looked
at
;
and
the
pump
-
room
to
be
attended
,
where
they
paraded
up
and
down
for
an
hour
,
looking
at
everybody
and
speaking
to
no
one
.
<EOS>
The
wish
of
a
numerous
acquaintance
in
Bath
was
still
uppermost
with
Mrs.
Allen
,
and
she
repeated
it
after
every
fresh
proof
,
which
every
morning
brought
,
of
her
knowing
nobody
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
They
made
their
appearance
in
the
Lower
Rooms
;
and
here
fortune
was
more
favourable
to
our
heroine
.
<EOS>
The
master
of
the
ceremonies
introduced
to
her
a
very
gentlemanlike
young
man
as
a
partner
;
his
name
was
Tilney
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
about
four
or
five
and
twenty
,
was
rather
tall
,
had
a
pleasing
countenance
,
a
very
intelligent
and
lively
eye
,
and
,
if
not
quite
handsome
,
was
very
near
it
.
<EOS>
His
address
was
good
,
and
Catherine
felt
herself
in
high
luck
.
<EOS>
There
was
little
leisure
for
speaking
while
they
danced
;
but
when
they
were
seated
at
tea
,
she
found
him
as
agreeable
as
she
had
already
given
him
credit
for
being
.
<EOS>
He
talked
with
fluency
and
spirit
 
and
there
was
an
archness
and
pleasantry
in
his
manner
which
interested
,
though
it
was
hardly
understood
by
her
.
<EOS>
After
chatting
some
time
on
such
matters
as
naturally
arose
from
the
objects
around
them
,
he
suddenly
addressed
her
with
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hitherto
been
very
remiss
,
madam
,
in
the
proper
attentions
of
a
partner
here
;
I
have
not
yet
asked
you
how
long
you
have
been
in
Bath
;
whether
you
were
ever
here
before
;
whether
you
have
been
at
the
Upper
Rooms
,
the
theatre
,
and
the
concert
;
and
how
you
like
the
place
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
very
negligent
 
but
are
you
now
at
leisure
to
satisfy
me
in
these
particulars
?
<EOS>
If
you
are
I
will
begin
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
give
yourself
that
trouble
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
trouble
,
I
assure
you
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
forming
his
features
into
a
set
smile
,
and
affectedly
softening
his
voice
,
he
added
,
with
a
simpering
air
,
"
Have
you
been
long
in
Bath
,
madam
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
a
week
,
sir
,
"
replied
Catherine
,
trying
not
to
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Really
!
"
<EOS>
with
affected
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
be
surprised
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
indeed
!
"
said
he
,
in
his
natural
tone
.
"
<EOS>
But
some
emotion
must
appear
to
be
raised
by
your
reply
,
and
surprise
is
more
easily
assumed
,
and
not
less
reasonable
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
Now
let
us
go
on
.
<EOS>
Were
you
never
here
before
,
madam
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Never
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
Have
you
yet
honoured
the
Upper
Rooms
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
I
was
there
last
Monday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
to
the
theatre
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
I
was
at
the
play
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
the
concert
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
sir
,
on
Wednesday
.
"
  
"
And
are
you
altogether
pleased
with
Bath
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
I
like
it
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
must
give
one
smirk
,
and
then
we
may
be
rational
again
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
turned
away
her
head
,
not
knowing
whether
she
might
venture
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
what
you
think
of
me
,
"
said
he
gravely
 
"
I
shall
make
but
<EOS>
a
poor
figure
in
your
journal
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
journal
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
exactly
what
you
will
say
:
Friday
,
went
to
the
Lower
Rooms
;
wore
my
sprigged
muslin
robe
with
blue
trimmings
 
<EOS>
plain
black
shoes
 
appeared
to
much
advantage
;
but
was
strangely
harassed
by
a
queer
,
half
-
witted
man
,
who
would
make
me
dance
with
him
,
and
distressed
me
by
his
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
shall
say
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
you
what
you
ought
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
danced
with
a
very
agreeable
young
man
,
introduced
by
Mr.
King
;
had
a
great
deal
of
conversation
with
him
 
seems
a
most
extraordinary
genius
 
<EOS>
hope
I
may
know
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
That
,
madam
,
is
what
I
wish
you
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
perhaps
,
I
keep
no
journal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
are
not
sitting
in
this
room
,
and
I
am
not
sitting
by
you
.
<EOS>
These
are
points
in
which
a
doubt
is
equally
possible
.
<EOS>
Not
keep
a
journal
!
<EOS>
How
are
your
absent
cousins
to
understand
the
tenour
of
your
life
in
Bath
without
one
?
<EOS>
How
are
the
civilities
and
compliments
of
every
day
to
be
related
as
they
ought
to
be
,
unless
noted
down
every
evening
in
a
journal
?
<EOS>
How
are
your
various
dresses
to
be
remembered
,
and
the
particular
state
of
your
complexion
,
and
curl
of
your
hair
to
be
described
in
all
their
diversities
,
without
having
constant
recourse
to
a
journal
?
<EOS>
My
dear
madam
,
I
am
not
so
ignorant
of
young
ladies
'
ways
as
you
wish
to
believe
me
;
it
is
this
delightful
habit
of
journaling
which
largely
contributes
to
form
the
easy
style
of
writing
for
which
ladies
are
so
generally
celebrated
.
<EOS>
Everybody
allows
that
the
talent
of
writing
agreeable
letters
is
peculiarly
female
.
<EOS>
Nature
may
have
done
something
,
but
I
am
sure
it
must
be
essentially
assisted
by
the
practice
of
keeping
a
journal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
sometimes
thought
,
"
said
Catherine
,
doubtingly
,
"
whether
ladies
do
write
so
much
better
letters
than
gentlemen
!
<EOS>
That
is
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
think
the
superiority
was
always
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
have
had
opportunity
of
judging
,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
usual
style
of
letter
-
writing
among
women
is
faultless
,
except
in
three
particulars
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
general
deficiency
of
subject
,
a
total
inattention
to
stops
,
and
a
very
frequent
ignorance
of
grammar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
!
<EOS>
I
need
not
have
been
afraid
of
disclaiming
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
think
too
highly
of
us
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
no
more
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule
that
women
write
better
letters
than
men
,
than
that
they
sing
better
duets
,
or
draw
better
landscapes
.
<EOS>
In
every
power
,
of
which
taste
is
the
foundation
,
excellence
is
pretty
fairly
divided
between
the
sexes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
interrupted
by
Mrs.
Allen
:
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Catherine
,
"
said
she
,
"
do
take
this
pin
out
of
my
sleeve
;
I
am
afraid
it
has
torn
a
hole
already
;
I
shall
be
quite
sorry
if
it
has
,
for
this
is
a
favourite
gown
,
though
it
cost
but
nine
shillings
a
yard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
exactly
what
I
should
have
guessed
it
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr.
Tilney
,
looking
at
the
muslin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
understand
muslins
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Particularly
well
;
I
always
buy
my
own
cravats
,
and
am
allowed
to
be
an
excellent
judge
;
and
my
sister
has
often
trusted
me
in
the
choice
of
a
gown
.
<EOS>
I
bought
one
for
her
the
other
day
,
and
it
was
pronounced
to
be
a
prodigious
bargain
by
every
lady
who
saw
it
.
<EOS>
I
gave
but
five
shillings
a
yard
for
it
,
and
a
true
Indian
muslin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
was
quite
struck
by
his
genius
.
<EOS>
"
Men
commonly
take
so
little
notice
of
those
things
,
"
said
she
;
"
I
can
never
get
Mr.
Allen
to
know
one
of
my
gowns
from
another
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
a
great
comfort
to
your
sister
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
am
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
pray
,
sir
,
what
do
you
think
of
Miss
Morland
's
gown
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
pretty
,
madam
,
"
said
he
,
gravely
examining
it
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
it
will
wash
well
<EOS>
;
I
am
afraid
it
will
fray
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
,
"
said
Catherine
,
laughing
,
"
be
<EOS>
so
 
"
She
had
almost
said
"
strange
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Allen
;
"
and
so
I
told
Miss
Morland
when
she
bought
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
then
you
know
,
madam
,
muslin
always
turns
to
some
account
or
other
;
Miss
Morland
will
get
enough
out
of
it
for
a
handkerchief
,
or
a
cap
,
or
a
cloak
.
<EOS>
Muslin
can
never
be
said
to
be
wasted
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
my
sister
say
<EOS>
so
forty
times
,
when
she
has
been
extravagant
in
buying
more
than
she
wanted
,
or
careless
in
cutting
it
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bath
is
a
charming
place
,
sir
;
there
are
so
many
good
shops
here
.
<EOS>
We
are
sadly
off
in
the
country
;
not
but
what
we
have
very
good
shops
in
Salisbury
,
but
it
is
so
far
to
go
 
<EOS>
eight
miles
is
a
long
way
;
Mr.
Allen
says
it
is
nine
,
measured
nine
;
but
I
am
sure
it
can
not
be
more
than
eight
;
and
it
is
such
a
fag
 
<EOS>
I
come
back
tired
to
death
.
<EOS>
Now
,
here
one
can
step
out
of
doors
and
get
a
thing
in
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
was
polite
enough
to
seem
interested
in
what
she
said
;
and
she
kept
him
on
the
subject
of
muslins
till
the
dancing
recommenced
.
<EOS>
Catherine
feared
,
as
she
listened
to
their
discourse
,
that
he
indulged
himself
a
little
too
much
with
the
foibles
of
others
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
thinking
of
so
earnestly
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
as
they
walked
back
to
the
ballroom
;
"
not
of
your
partner
,
I
hope
,
for
,
by
that
shake
of
the
head
,
your
meditations
are
not
satisfactory
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
coloured
,
and
said
,
"
I
was
not
thinking
of
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
artful
and
deep
,
to
be
sure
;
but
I
had
rather
be
told
at
once
that
you
will
not
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
I
will
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
;
for
now
we
shall
soon
be
acquainted
,
as
I
am
authorized
to
tease
you
on
this
subject
whenever
we
meet
,
and
nothing
in
the
world
advances
intimacy
so
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
danced
again
;
and
,
when
the
assembly
closed
,
parted
,
on
the
lady
's
side
at
least
,
with
a
strong
inclination
for
continuing
the
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Whether
she
thought
of
him
so
much
,
while
she
drank
her
warm
wine
and
water
,
and
prepared
herself
for
bed
,
as
to
dream
of
him
when
there
,
can
not
be
ascertained
;
but
I
hope
it
was
no
more
than
in
a
slight
slumber
,
or
a
morning
doze
at
most
;
for
if
it
be
true
,
as
a
celebrated
writer
has
maintained
,
that
no
young
lady
can
be
justified
in
falling
in
love
before
the
gentleman
's
love
is
declared
,
*
it
must
be
very
improper
that
a
young
lady
should
dream
of
a
gentleman
before
the
gentleman
is
first
known
to
have
dreamt
of
her
.
<EOS>
How
proper
Mr.
Tilney
might
be
as
a
dreamer
or
a
lover
had
not
yet
perhaps
entered
Mr.
Allen
's
head
,
but
that
he
was
not
objectionable
as
a
common
acquaintance
for
his
young
charge
<EOS>
he
was
on
inquiry
satisfied
;
for
he
had
early
in
the
evening
<EOS>
taken
pains
to
know
who
her
partner
was
,
and
had
been
assured
of
Mr.
Tilney
's
being
a
clergyman
,
and
of
a
very
respectable
family
in
Gloucestershire
.
    
<EOS>
With
more
than
usual
eagerness
did
Catherine
hasten
to
the
pump
-
room
the
next
day
,
secure
within
herself
of
seeing
Mr.
Tilney
there
before
the
morning
were
over
,
and
ready
to
meet
him
with
a
smile
;
but
no
smile
was
demanded
 
Mr.
Tilney
did
not
appear
.
<EOS>
Every
creature
in
Bath
,
except
himself
,
was
to
be
seen
in
the
room
at
different
periods
of
the
fashionable
hours
;
crowds
of
people
were
every
moment
passing
in
and
out
,
up
the
steps
and
down
;
people
whom
nobody
cared
about
,
and
nobody
wanted
to
see
;
and
he
only
was
absent
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
delightful
place
Bath
is
,
"
said
Mrs.
Allen
as
they
sat
down
near
the
great
clock
,
after
parading
the
room
till
they
were
tired
;
"
and
how
pleasant
it
would
be
if
we
had
any
acquaintance
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
sentiment
had
been
uttered
so
often
in
vain
that
Mrs.
Allen
had
no
particular
reason
to
hope
it
would
be
followed
with
more
advantage
now
;
but
we
are
told
to
"
despair
of
nothing
we
would
attain
,
"
as
"
unwearied
diligence
our
point
would
gain
"
;
and
the
unwearied
diligence
with
which
she
had
every
day
wished
for
the
same
thing
was
at
length
to
have
its
just
reward
,
for
hardly
had
she
been
seated
ten
minutes
before
a
lady
of
about
her
own
age
,
who
was
sitting
by
her
,
and
had
been
looking
at
her
attentively
for
several
minutes
,
addressed
her
with
great
complaisance
in
these
words
:
"
I
think
,
madam
,
I
can
not
be
mistaken
;
it
is
a
long
time
since
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
,
but
is
not
your
name
Allen
?
"
<EOS>
This
question
answered
,
as
it
readily
was
,
the
stranger
pronounced
hers
to
be
Thorpe
;
and
Mrs.
Allen
immediately
recognized
the
features
of
a
former
schoolfellow
and
intimate
,
whom
she
had
seen
only
once
since
their
respective
marriages
,
and
that
many
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Their
joy
on
this
meeting
was
very
great
,
as
well
it
might
,
since
they
had
been
contented
to
know
nothing
of
each
other
for
the
last
fifteen
years
.
<EOS>
Compliments
on
good
looks
now
passed
;
and
,
after
observing
how
time
had
slipped
away
since
they
were
last
together
,
how
little
they
had
thought
of
meeting
in
Bath
,
and
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
see
an
old
friend
,
they
proceeded
to
make
inquiries
and
give
intelligence
as
to
their
families
,
sisters
,
and
cousins
,
talking
both
together
,
far
more
ready
to
give
than
to
receive
information
,
and
each
hearing
very
little
of
what
the
other
said
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
however
,
had
one
great
advantage
as
a
talker
,
over
Mrs.
Allen
,
in
a
family
of
children
;
and
when
she
expatiated
on
the
talents
of
her
sons
,
and
the
beauty
of
her
daughters
,
when
she
related
their
different
situations
and
views
 
that
John
was
at
Oxford
,
Edward
at
Merchant
Taylors
'
,
and
William
at
sea
 
and
all
of
them
more
beloved
and
respected
in
their
different
station
than
any
other
three
beings
<EOS>
ever
were
,
Mrs.
Allen
had
no
similar
information
to
give
,
no
similar
triumphs
to
press
on
the
unwilling
and
unbelieving
ear
of
her
friend
,
and
was
forced
to
sit
and
appear
to
listen
to
all
these
maternal
effusions
,
consoling
herself
,
however
,
with
the
discovery
,
which
her
keen
eye
soon
made
,
that
the
lace
on
Mrs.
Thorpe
's
pelisse
was
not
half
so
handsome
as
that
on
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
come
my
dear
girls
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
pointing
at
three
smart
-
looking
females
who
,
arm
in
arm
,
were
then
moving
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs.
Allen
,
I
long
to
introduce
them
;
they
will
be
so
delighted
to
see
you
:
<EOS>
the
tallest
is
Isabella
,
my
eldest
;
is
not
she
a
fine
young
woman
?
<EOS>
The
others
are
very
much
admired
too
,
but
I
believe
Isabella
is
the
handsomest
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Miss
Thorpes
were
introduced
;
and
Miss
Morland
,
who
had
been
for
a
short
time
forgotten
,
was
introduced
likewise
.
<EOS>
The
name
seemed
to
strike
them
all
;
and
,
after
speaking
to
her
with
great
civility
,
the
eldest
young
lady
observed
aloud
to
the
rest
,
"
How
excessively
like
her
brother
Miss
Morland
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
picture
of
him
indeed
!
"
cried
the
mother
 
<EOS>
and
"
I
should
have
known
her
anywhere
for
his
sister
!
<EOS>
"
was
repeated
by
them
all
,
two
or
three
times
over
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Catherine
was
surprised
;
but
Mrs.
Thorpe
and
her
daughters
had
scarcely
begun
the
history
of
their
acquaintance
with
Mr.
James
Morland
,
before
she
remembered
that
her
eldest
brother
had
lately
formed
an
intimacy
with
a
young
man
of
his
own
college
,
of
the
name
of
Thorpe
;
and
that
he
had
spent
the
last
week
of
the
Christmas
vacation
with
his
family
,
near
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
being
explained
,
many
obliging
things
were
said
by
the
Miss
Thorpes
of
their
wish
of
being
better
acquainted
with
her
;
of
being
considered
as
already
friends
,
through
the
friendship
of
their
brothers
,
etc
.
,
which
Catherine
heard
with
pleasure
,
and
answered
with
all
the
pretty
expressions
she
could
command
;
and
,
as
the
first
proof
of
amity
,
she
was
soon
invited
to
accept
an
arm
of
the
eldest
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
take
a
turn
with
her
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
delighted
with
this
extension
of
her
Bath
acquaintance
,
and
almost
forgot
Mr.
Tilney
while
she
talked
to
Miss
Thorpe
.
<EOS>
Friendship
is
certainly
the
finest
balm
for
the
pangs
of
disappointed
love
.
  
<EOS>
Their
conversation
turned
upon
those
subjects
,
of
which
the
free
discussion
has
generally
much
to
do
in
perfecting
a
sudden
intimacy
between
two
young
ladies
:
such
as
dress
,
balls
,
flirtations
,
and
quizzes
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorpe
,
however
,
being
four
years
older
than
Miss
Morland
,
and
at
least
four
years
better
informed
,
had
a
very
decided
advantage
in
discussing
such
points
;
she
could
compare
the
balls
of
Bath
with
those
of
Tunbridge
,
its
fashions
with
the
fashions
of
London
;
could
rectify
the
opinions
of
her
new
friend
in
many
articles
of
tasteful
attire
;
could
discover
a
flirtation
between
any
gentleman
and
lady
who
only
smiled
on
each
other
;
and
point
out
a
quiz
through
the
thickness
of
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
These
powers
received
due
admiration
from
Catherine
,
to
whom
they
were
entirely
new
;
and
the
respect
which
they
naturally
inspired
might
have
been
too
great
for
familiarity
,
had
not
the
easy
gaiety
of
Miss
Thorpe
's
manners
,
and
her
frequent
expressions
of
delight
on
this
acquaintance
with
her
,
softened
down
every
feeling
of
awe
,
and
left
nothing
but
tender
affection
.
<EOS>
Their
increasing
attachment
was
not
to
be
satisfied
with
half
a
dozen
turns
in
the
pump
-
room
,
but
required
,
when
they
all
quitted
it
together
,
that
Miss
Thorpe
should
accompany
Miss
Morland
to
the
very
door
of
Mr.
Allen
's
house
;
and
that
they
should
there
part
with
a
most
affectionate
and
lengthened
shake
of
hands
,
after
learning
,
to
their
mutual
relief
,
that
they
should
see
each
other
across
the
theatre
at
night
,
and
say
their
prayers
in
the
same
chapel
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
Catherine
then
ran
directly
upstairs
,
and
watched
Miss
Thorpe
's
progress
down
the
street
from
the
drawing
-
room
window
;
admired
the
graceful
spirit
of
her
walk
,
the
fashionable
air
of
her
figure
and
dress
;
and
felt
grateful
,
as
well
she
might
,
for
the
chance
which
had
procured
her
such
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
was
a
widow
,
and
not
a
very
rich
one
;
she
was
a
good
-
humoured
,
well
-
meaning
woman
,
and
a
very
indulgent
mother
.
<EOS>
Her
eldest
daughter
had
great
personal
beauty
,
and
the
younger
ones
,
by
pretending
to
be
as
handsome
as
their
sister
,
imitating
her
air
,
and
dressing
in
the
same
style
,
did
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
This
brief
account
of
the
family
is
intended
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
a
long
and
minute
detail
from
Mrs.
Thorpe
herself
,
of
her
past
adventures
and
sufferings
,
which
might
otherwise
be
expected
to
occupy
the
three
or
four
following
chapters
;
in
which
the
worthlessness
of
lords
and
attorneys
might
be
set
forth
,
and
conversations
,
which
had
passed
twenty
years
before
,
be
minutely
repeated
.
    
<EOS>
Catherine
was
not
so
much
engaged
at
the
theatre
that
evening
,
in
returning
the
nods
and
smiles
of
Miss
Thorpe
,
though
they
certainly
claimed
much
of
her
leisure
,
as
to
forget
to
look
with
an
inquiring
eye
for
Mr.
Tilney
in
every
box
which
her
eye
could
reach
;
but
she
looked
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
was
no
fonder
of
the
play
than
the
pump
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
hoped
to
be
more
fortunate
the
next
day
;
and
when
her
wishes
for
fine
weather
were
answered
by
seeing
a
beautiful
morning
,
she
hardly
felt
a
doubt
of
it
;
for
a
fine
Sunday
in
Bath
empties
every
house
of
its
inhabitants
,
and
all
the
world
appears
on
such
an
occasion
to
walk
about
and
tell
their
acquaintance
what
a
charming
day
it
is
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
divine
service
was
over
,
the
Thorpes
and
Allens
eagerly
joined
each
other
;
and
after
staying
long
enough
in
the
pump
-
room
to
discover
that
the
crowd
was
insupportable
,
and
that
there
was
not
a
genteel
face
to
be
seen
,
which
everybody
discovers
every
Sunday
throughout
the
season
,
they
hastened
away
to
the
Crescent
,
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
of
better
company
.
<EOS>
Here
Catherine
and
Isabella
,
arm
in
arm
,
again
tasted
the
sweets
of
friendship
in
an
unreserved
conversation
;
they
talked
much
,
and
with
much
enjoyment
;
but
again
was
Catherine
disappointed
in
her
hope
of
reseeing
her
partner
.
<EOS>
He
was
nowhere
to
be
met
with
;
every
search
for
him
was
equally
unsuccessful
,
in
morning
lounges
or
evening
assemblies
;
neither
at
the
Upper
nor
Lower
Rooms
,
at
dressed
or
undressed
balls
,
was
he
perceivable
;
nor
among
the
walkers
,
the
horsemen
,
or
the
curricle
-
drivers
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
His
name
was
not
in
the
pump
-
room
book
,
and
curiosity
could
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
gone
from
Bath
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
had
not
mentioned
that
his
stay
would
be
so
short
!
<EOS>
This
sort
of
mysteriousness
,
which
is
always
so
becoming
in
a
hero
,
threw
a
fresh
grace
in
Catherine
's
imagination
around
his
person
and
manners
,
and
increased
her
anxiety
to
know
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
From
the
Thorpes
she
could
learn
nothing
,
for
they
had
been
only
two
days
in
Bath
before
they
met
with
Mrs.
Allen
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
subject
,
however
,
in
which
she
often
indulged
with
her
fair
friend
,
from
whom
she
received
every
possible
encouragement
to
continue
to
think
of
him
;
and
his
impression
on
her
fancy
was
not
suffered
therefore
to
weaken
.
<EOS>
Isabella
was
very
sure
that
he
must
be
a
charming
young
man
,
and
was
equally
sure
that
he
must
have
been
delighted
with
her
dear
Catherine
,
and
would
therefore
shortly
return
.
<EOS>
She
liked
him
the
better
for
being
a
clergyman
,
"
for
she
must
confess
herself
very
partial
to
the
profession
"
;
and
something
like
a
sigh
escaped
her
as
she
said
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Catherine
was
wrong
in
not
demanding
the
cause
of
that
gentle
emotion
 
<EOS>
but
she
was
not
experienced
enough
in
the
finesse
of
love
,
or
the
duties
of
friendship
,
to
know
when
delicate
raillery
was
properly
called
for
,
or
when
a
confidence
should
be
forced
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
was
now
quite
happy
 
quite
satisfied
with
Bath
.
<EOS>
She
had
found
some
acquaintance
,
had
been
so
lucky
too
as
to
find
in
them
the
family
of
a
most
worthy
old
friend
;
and
,
as
the
completion
of
good
fortune
,
had
found
these
friends
by
no
means
so
expensively
dressed
as
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
daily
expressions
were
no
longer
,
"
I
wish
we
had
some
acquaintance
in
Bath
!
<EOS>
"
They
were
changed
into
,
"
How
glad
I
am
we
have
met
with
Mrs.
Thorpe
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
was
as
eager
in
promoting
the
intercourse
of
the
two
families
,
as
her
young
charge
and
Isabella
themselves
could
be
;
never
satisfied
with
the
day
unless
she
spent
the
chief
of
it
by
the
side
of
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
in
what
they
called
conversation
,
but
in
which
there
was
scarcely
ever
any
exchange
of
opinion
,
and
not
often
any
resemblance
of
subject
,
for
Mrs.
Thorpe
talked
chiefly
of
her
children
,
and
Mrs.
Allen
of
her
gowns
.
  
<EOS>
The
progress
of
the
friendship
between
Catherine
and
Isabella
was
quick
as
its
beginning
had
been
warm
,
and
they
passed
so
rapidly
through
every
gradation
of
increasing
tenderness
that
there
was
shortly
no
fresh
proof
of
it
to
be
given
to
their
friends
or
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
called
each
other
by
their
Christian
name
,
were
always
arm
in
arm
when
they
walked
,
pinned
up
each
other
's
train
for
the
dance
,
and
were
not
to
be
divided
in
the
set
;
and
if
a
rainy
morning
deprived
them
of
other
enjoyments
,
they
were
still
resolute
in
meeting
in
defiance
of
wet
and
dirt
,
and
shut
themselves
up
,
to
read
novels
together
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
novels
;
for
I
will
not
adopt
that
ungenerous
and
impolitic
custom
so
common
with
novel
-
writers
,
of
degrading
by
their
contemptuous
censure
the
very
performances
,
to
the
number
of
which
they
are
themselves
adding
 
joining
with
their
greatest
enemies
in
bestowing
the
harshest
epithets
on
such
works
,
and
scarcely
ever
permitting
them
to
be
read
by
their
own
heroine
,
who
,
if
she
accidentally
take
up
a
novel
,
is
sure
to
turn
over
its
insipid
pages
with
disgust
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
If
the
heroine
of
one
novel
be
not
patronized
by
the
heroine
of
another
,
from
whom
can
she
expect
protection
and
regard
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
approve
of
it
.
<EOS>
Let
us
leave
it
to
the
reviewers
to
abuse
such
effusions
of
fancy
at
their
leisure
,
and
over
every
new
novel
to
talk
in
threadbare
strains
of
the
trash
with
which
the
press
now
groans
.
<EOS>
Let
us
not
desert
one
another
;
we
are
an
injured
body
.
<EOS>
Although
our
productions
have
afforded
more
extensive
and
unaffected
pleasure
than
those
of
any
other
literary
corporation
in
the
world
,
no
species
of
composition
has
been
so
much
decried
.
<EOS>
From
pride
,
ignorance
,
or
fashion
,
our
foes
are
almost
as
many
as
our
readers
.
<EOS>
And
while
the
abilities
of
the
nine
-
hundredth
abridger
of
the
History
of
England
,
or
of
the
man
who
collects
and
publishes
in
a
volume
some
dozen
lines
of
Milton
,
Pope
,
and
Prior
,
with
a
paper
from
the
Spectator
,
and
a
chapter
from
Sterne
,
are
eulogized
by
a
thousand
pens
 
there
seems
almost
a
general
wish
of
decrying
the
capacity
and
undervaluing
the
labour
of
the
novelist
,
and
of
slighting
the
performances
which
have
only
genius
,
wit
,
and
taste
to
recommend
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
novel
-
reader
 
<EOS>
I
seldom
look
into
novels
 
Do
not
imagine
that
I
often
read
novels
 
<EOS>
It
is
really
very
well
for
a
novel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
is
the
common
ca
nt
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
are
you
reading
,
Miss
 
?
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
It
is
only
a
novel
!
<EOS>
"
replies
the
young
lady
,
while
she
lays
down
her
book
with
affected
indifference
,
or
momentary
shame
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
Cecilia
,
or
Camilla
,
or
Belinda
"
;
or
,
in
short
,
only
some
work
in
which
the
greatest
powers
of
the
mind
are
displayed
,
in
which
the
most
thorough
knowledge
of
human
nature
,
the
happiest
delineation
of
its
varieties
,
the
liveliest
effusions
of
wit
and
humour
,
are
conveyed
to
the
world
in
the
best
-
chosen
language
.
<EOS>
Now
,
had
the
same
young
lady
been
engaged
with
a
volume
of
the
Spectator
,
instead
of
such
a
work
,
how
proudly
would
she
have
produced
the
book
,
and
told
its
name
;
though
the
chances
must
be
against
her
being
occupied
by
any
part
of
that
voluminous
publication
,
of
which
either
the
matter
or
manner
would
not
disgust
a
young
person
of
taste
:
the
substance
of
its
papers
so
often
consisting
in
the
statement
of
improbable
circumstances
,
unnatural
characters
,
and
topics
of
conversation
which
no
longer
concern
anyone
living
;
and
their
language
,
too
,
frequently
so
coarse
as
to
give
no
very
favourable
idea
of
the
age
that
could
endure
it
.
    
<EOS>
The
following
conversation
,
which
took
place
between
the
two
friends
in
the
pump
-
room
one
morning
,
after
an
acquaintance
of
eight
or
nine
days
,
is
given
as
a
specimen
of
their
very
warm
attachment
,
and
of
the
delicacy
,
discretion
,
originality
of
thought
,
and
literary
taste
which
marked
the
reasonableness
of
that
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
They
met
by
appointment
;
and
as
Isabella
had
arrived
nearly
five
minutes
before
her
friend
,
her
first
address
naturally
was
,
"
<EOS>
My
dearest
creature
,
what
can
have
made
you
so
late
?
<EOS>
I
have
been
waiting
for
you
at
least
this
age
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
;
but
really
I
thought
I
was
in
very
good
time
.
<EOS>
It
is
but
just
one
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
not
been
here
long
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
These
ten
ages
at
least
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
have
been
here
this
half
hour
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
let
us
go
and
sit
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
enjoy
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
hundred
things
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
was
so
afraid
it
would
rain
this
morning
,
just
as
I
wanted
to
set
off
;
it
looked
very
showery
,
and
that
would
have
thrown
me
into
agonies
!
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
I
saw
the
prettiest
hat
you
can
imagine
,
in
a
shop
window
in
Milsom
Street
just
now
 
very
like
yours
,
only
with
coquelicot
ribbons
instead
of
green
;
I
quite
longed
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dearest
Catherine
,
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
all
this
morning
?
<EOS>
Have
you
gone
on
with
Udolpho
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
been
reading
it
ever
since
I
woke
;
and
I
am
got
to
the
black
veil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
How
delightful
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
tell
you
what
is
behind
the
black
veil
for
the
world
!
<EOS>
Are
not
you
wild
to
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
quite
;
what
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
But
do
not
tell
me
 
I
would
not
be
told
upon
any
account
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
must
be
a
skeleton
,
I
am
sure
it
is
Laurentina
's
skeleton
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
delighted
with
the
book
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
spend
my
whole
life
in
reading
it
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
if
it
had
not
been
to
meet
you
,
I
would
not
have
come
away
from
it
for
all
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
creature
!
<EOS>
How
much
I
am
obliged
to
you
;
and
when
you
have
finished
Udolpho
,
we
will
read
the
Italian
together
;
and
I
have
made
out
a
list
of
ten
or
twelve
more
of
the
same
kind
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
How
glad
I
am
!
<EOS>
What
are
they
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
read
you
their
names
directly
;
here
they
are
,
in
my
pocketbook
.
<EOS>
Castle
of
Wolfenbach
,
Clermont
,
Mysterious
Warnings
,
Necromancer
of
the
Black
Forest
,
Midnight
Bell
,
Orphan
of
the
Rhine
,
and
Horrid
Mysteries
.
<EOS>
Those
will
last
us
some
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
pretty
well
;
but
are
they
all
horrid
,
are
you
sure
they
are
all
horrid
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
quite
sure
;
for
a
particular
friend
of
mine
,
a
Miss
Andrews
,
a
sweet
girl
,
one
of
the
sweetest
creatures
in
the
world
,
has
read
every
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
knew
Miss
Andrews
,
you
would
be
delighted
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
netting
herself
the
sweetest
cloak
you
can
conceive
.
<EOS>
I
think
her
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
,
and
I
am
so
vexed
with
the
men
for
not
admiring
her
!
<EOS>
I
scold
them
all
amazingly
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Scold
them
!
<EOS>
Do
you
scold
them
for
not
admiring
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
I
would
not
do
for
those
who
are
really
my
friends
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
notion
of
loving
people
by
halves
;
it
is
not
my
nature
.
<EOS>
My
attachments
are
always
excessively
strong
.
<EOS>
I
told
Captain
Hunt
at
one
of
our
assemblies
this
winter
that
if
he
was
to
tease
me
all
night
,
I
would
not
dance
with
him
,
unless
he
would
allow
Miss
Andrews
to
be
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
.
<EOS>
The
men
think
us
incapable
of
real
friendship
,
you
know
,
and
I
am
determined
to
show
them
the
difference
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
I
were
to
hear
anybody
speak
slightingly
of
you
,
I
should
fire
up
in
a
moment
:
but
that
is
not
at
all
likely
,
for
you
are
just
the
kind
of
girl
to
be
a
great
favourite
with
the
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catherine
,
colouring
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
very
well
;
you
have
so
much
animation
,
which
is
exactly
what
Miss
Andrews
wants
,
for
I
must
confess
<EOS>
there
is
something
amazingly
insipid
about
her
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
,
that
just
after
we
parted
yesterday
,
I
saw
a
young
man
looking
at
you
so
earnestly
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
is
in
love
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
coloured
,
and
disclaimed
again
.
<EOS>
Isabella
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
true
,
upon
my
honour
,
but
I
see
how
it
is
;
you
are
indifferent
to
everybody
's
admiration
,
except
that
of
one
gentleman
,
who
shall
be
nameless
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
can
not
blame
you
"
 
speaking
more
seriously
 
<EOS>
"
your
feelings
are
easily
understood
.
<EOS>
Where
the
heart
is
really
attached
,
I
know
very
well
how
little
one
can
be
pleased
with
the
attention
of
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
Everything
is
so
insipid
,
so
uninteresting
,
that
does
not
relate
to
the
beloved
object
!
<EOS>
I
can
perfectly
comprehend
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
should
not
persuade
me
that
I
think
so
very
much
about
Mr.
Tilney
,
for
perhaps
I
may
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
see
him
again
!
<EOS>
My
dearest
creature
,
do
not
talk
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
would
be
miserable
if
you
thought
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
I
should
not
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
I
was
not
very
much
pleased
with
him
;
but
while
I
have
Udolpho
to
read
,
I
feel
as
if
nobody
could
make
me
miserable
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
The
dreadful
black
veil
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Isabella
,
I
am
sure
there
must
be
Laurentina
's
skeleton
behind
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
odd
to
me
,
that
you
should
never
have
read
Udolpho
before
;
but
I
suppose
Mrs.
Morland
objects
to
novels
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
she
does
not
.
<EOS>
She
very
often
reads
Sir
Charles
Grandison
herself
;
but
new
books
do
not
fall
in
our
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Charles
Grandison
!
<EOS>
That
is
an
amazing
horrid
book
,
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
remember
Miss
Andrews
could
not
get
through
the
first
volume
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
like
Udolpho
at
all
;
but
yet
I
think
it
is
very
entertaining
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
indeed
!
<EOS>
You
surprise
me
;
I
thought
it
had
not
been
readable
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dearest
Catherine
,
have
you
settled
what
to
wear
on
your
head
tonight
?
<EOS>
I
am
determined
at
all
events
to
be
dressed
exactly
like
you
.
<EOS>
The
men
take
notice
of
that
sometimes
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
does
not
signify
if
they
do
,
"
said
Catherine
,
very
innocently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Signify
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
heavens
!
<EOS>
I
make
it
a
rule
never
to
mind
what
they
say
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
often
amazingly
impertinent
if
you
do
not
treat
them
with
spirit
,
and
make
them
keep
their
distance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
they
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
never
observed
that
.
<EOS>
They
always
behave
very
well
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
They
give
themselves
such
airs
.
<EOS>
They
are
the
most
conceited
creatures
in
the
world
,
and
think
themselves
of
so
much
importance
!
<EOS>
By
the
by
,
though
I
have
thought
of
it
a
hundred
times
,
I
have
always
forgot
to
ask
you
what
is
your
favourite
complexion
in
a
man
.
<EOS>
Do
you
like
them
best
dark
or
fair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
I
never
much
thought
about
it
.
<EOS>
Something
between
both
<EOS>
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Brown
 
not
fair
,
and
 
and
not
very
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Catherine
.
<EOS>
That
is
exactly
he
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
forgot
your
description
of
Mr.
Tilney
 
"
a
brown
skin
,
with
dark
eyes
,
and
rather
dark
hair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
taste
is
different
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
light
eyes
,
and
as
to
complexion
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
 
<EOS>
I
like
a
sallow
better
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
betray
me
,
if
you
should
ever
meet
with
one
of
your
acquaintance
answering
that
description
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Betray
you
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
do
not
distress
me
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
said
too
much
.
<EOS>
Let
us
drop
the
subject
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
in
some
amazement
,
complied
,
and
after
remaining
a
few
moments
silent
,
was
on
the
point
of
reverting
to
what
interested
her
at
that
time
rather
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
,
Laurentina
's
skeleton
,
when
her
friend
prevented
her
,
by
saying
,
"
For
heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
Let
us
move
away
from
this
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
there
are
two
odious
young
men
who
have
been
staring
at
me
this
half
hour
.
<EOS>
They
really
put
me
quite
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
and
look
at
the
arrivals
.
<EOS>
They
will
hardly
follow
us
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Away
they
walked
to
the
book
;
and
while
Isabella
examined
the
names
,
it
was
Catherine
's
employment
to
watch
the
proceedings
of
these
alarming
young
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
not
coming
this
way
,
are
they
?
<EOS>
I
hope
they
are
not
so
impertinent
as
to
follow
us
.
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
know
if
they
are
coming
.
<EOS>
I
am
determined
I
will
not
look
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
Catherine
,
with
unaffected
pleasure
,
assured
her
that
she
need
not
be
longer
uneasy
,
as
the
gentlemen
had
just
left
the
pump
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
which
way
are
they
gone
?
"
said
Isabella
,
turning
hastily
round
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
was
a
very
good
-
looking
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
went
towards
the
church
-
yard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
am
amazingly
glad
I
have
got
rid
of
them
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
what
say
you
to
going
to
Edgar
's
Buildings
with
me
,
and
looking
at
my
new
hat
?
<EOS>
You
said
you
should
like
to
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
readily
agreed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
,
"
she
added
,
"
perhaps
we
may
overtake
the
two
young
men
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Never
mind
that
.
<EOS>
If
we
make
haste
,
we
shall
pass
by
them
presently
,
and
I
am
dying
to
show
you
my
hat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
we
only
wait
a
few
minutes
,
there
will
be
no
danger
of
our
seeing
them
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
pay
them
any
such
compliment
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
notion
of
treating
men
with
such
respect
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
way
to
spoil
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
had
nothing
to
oppose
against
such
reasoning
;
and
therefore
,
to
show
the
independence
of
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
her
resolution
of
humbling
the
sex
,
they
set
off
immediately
as
fast
as
they
could
walk
,
in
pursuit
of
the
two
young
men
.
    
<EOS>
Half
a
minute
conducted
them
through
the
pump
-
yard
to
the
archway
,
opposite
Union
Passage
;
but
here
they
were
stopped
.
<EOS>
Everybody
acquainted
with
Bath
may
remember
the
difficulties
of
crossing
Cheap
Street
at
this
point
;
it
is
indeed
a
street
of
so
impertinent
<EOS>
a
nature
,
so
unfortunately
connected
with
the
great
London
and
Oxford
roads
,
and
the
principal
inn
of
the
city
,
that
a
day
never
passes
in
which
parties
of
ladies
,
however
important
their
business
,
whether
in
quest
of
pastry
,
millinery
,
or
even
(
as
in
the
present
case
)
of
young
men
,
are
not
detained
on
one
side
or
other
by
carriages
,
horsemen
,
or
carts
.
<EOS>
This
evil
had
been
felt
and
lamented
,
at
least
three
times
a
day
,
by
Isabella
since
her
residence
in
Bath
;
and
she
was
now
fated
to
feel
and
lament
it
once
more
,
for
at
the
very
moment
of
coming
opposite
to
Union
Passage
,
and
within
view
of
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
proceeding
through
the
crowds
,
and
threading
the
gutters
of
that
interesting
alley
,
they
were
prevented
crossing
by
the
approach
of
a
gig
,
driven
along
on
bad
pavement
by
a
most
knowing
-
looking
coachman
with
all
the
vehemence
that
could
most
fitly
endanger
the
lives
of
himself
,
his
companion
,
and
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
these
odious
gigs
!
<EOS>
"
said
Isabella
,
looking
up
.
<EOS>
"
How
I
detest
them
.
"
<EOS>
But
this
detestation
,
though
so
just
,
was
of
short
duration
,
for
she
looked
again
and
exclaimed
,
"
Delightful
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Morland
and
my
brother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heaven
!
'
<EOS>
tis
James
!
"
was
uttered
at
the
same
moment
by
Catherine
;
and
,
on
catching
the
young
men
's
eyes
,
the
horse
was
immediately
checked
with
a
violence
which
almost
threw
him
on
his
haunches
,
and
the
servant
having
now
scampered
up
,
the
gentlemen
jumped
out
,
and
the
equipage
was
delivered
to
his
care
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
by
whom
this
meeting
was
wholly
unexpected
,
received
her
brother
with
the
liveliest
pleasure
;
and
he
,
being
of
a
very
amiable
disposition
,
and
sincerely
attached
to
her
,
gave
every
proof
on
his
side
of
equal
satisfaction
,
which
he
could
have
leisure
to
do
,
while
the
bright
eyes
of
Miss
Thorpe
were
incessantly
challenging
his
notice
;
and
to
her
his
devoirs
were
speedily
paid
,
with
a
mixture
of
joy
and
embarrassment
which
might
have
informed
Catherine
,
had
she
been
more
expert
in
the
development
of
other
people
's
feelings
,
and
less
simply
engrossed
by
her
own
,
that
her
brother
thought
her
friend
quite
as
pretty
as
she
could
do
herself
.
  
<EOS>
John
Thorpe
,
who
in
the
meantime
had
been
giving
orders
about
the
horses
,
soon
joined
them
,
and
from
him
she
directly
received
the
amends
which
were
her
due
;
for
while
he
slightly
and
carelessly
touched
the
hand
of
Isabella
,
on
her
he
bestowed
a
whole
scrape
and
half
a
short
bow
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
stout
young
man
of
middling
height
,
who
,
with
a
plain
face
and
ungraceful
form
,
seemed
fearful
of
being
too
handsome
unless
he
wore
the
dress
of
a
groom
,
and
too
much
like
a
gentleman
unless
he
were
easy
where
he
ought
to
be
civil
,
and
impudent
where
he
might
be
allowed
to
be
easy
.
<EOS>
He
took
out
his
watch
:
"
<EOS>
How
long
do
you
think
we
have
been
running
it
from
Tetbury
,
Miss
Morland
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
the
distance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
brother
told
her
that
it
was
twenty
-
three
miles
.
  
<EOS>
"
Three
and
twenty
!
"
cried
Thorpe
.
"
<EOS>
Five
and
twenty
if
it
is
an
inch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Morland
remonstrated
,
pleaded
the
authority
of
road
-
books
,
innkeepers
,
and
milestones
;
but
his
friend
disregarded
them
all
;
he
had
a
surer
test
of
distance
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
must
be
five
and
twenty
,
"
said
he
,
"
by
the
time
we
have
been
doing
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
half
after
one
;
we
drove
out
of
the
inn
-
yard
at
Tetbury
as
the
town
clock
struck
eleven
;
and
I
defy
any
man
in
England
to
make
my
horse
go
less
than
ten
miles
an
hour
in
harness
;
that
makes
it
exactly
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
lost
an
hour
,
"
said
Morland
;
"
it
was
only
ten
o'clock
when
we
came
from
Tetbury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ten
o'clock
!
<EOS>
It
was
eleven
,
upon
my
soul
!
<EOS>
I
counted
every
stroke
.
<EOS>
This
brother
of
yours
would
persuade
me
out
of
my
senses
,
Miss
Morland
;
do
but
look
at
my
horse
;
did
you
ever
see
an
animal
so
made
for
speed
in
your
life
?
"
<EOS>
(
The
servant
had
just
mounted
the
carriage
and
was
driving
off
.
)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
true
blood
!
<EOS>
Three
hours
and
and
a
half
indeed
coming
only
three
and
twenty
miles
!
<EOS>
Look
at
that
creature
,
and
suppose
it
possible
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
look
very
hot
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hot
!
<EOS>
He
had
not
turned
a
hair
till
we
came
to
Walcot
Church
;
but
look
at
his
forehand
;
look
at
his
loins
;
only
see
how
he
moves
;
that
horse
can
not
go
less
than
ten
miles
an
hour
:
tie
his
legs
and
he
will
get
on
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
my
gig
,
Miss
Morland
?
<EOS>
A
neat
one
,
is
not
it
?
<EOS>
Well
hung
;
town
-
built
;
I
have
not
had
it
a
month
.
<EOS>
It
was
built
for
a
Christchurch
man
,
a
friend
of
mine
,
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
;
he
ran
it
a
few
weeks
,
till
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
it
was
convenient
to
have
done
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
happened
just
then
to
be
looking
out
for
some
light
thing
of
the
kind
,
though
I
had
pretty
well
determined
on
a
curricle
too
;
but
I
chanced
to
meet
him
on
Magdalen
Bridge
,
as
he
was
driving
into
Oxford
,
last
term
:
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Thorpe
,
"
said
he
,
"
do
you
happen
to
want
such
a
little
thing
as
this
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
capital
one
of
the
kind
,
but
I
am
cursed
tired
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
D
 
,
"
said
I
;
<EOS>
"
I
am
your
man
;
what
do
you
ask
?
"
<EOS>
And
how
much
do
you
think
he
did
,
Miss
Morland
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
can
not
guess
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Curricle
-
hung
,
you
see
;
seat
,
trunk
,
sword
-
case
,
splashing
-
board
,
lamps
,
silver
moulding
,
all
you
see
complete
;
the
iron
-
work
as
good
as
new
,
or
better
.
<EOS>
He
asked
fifty
guineas
;
I
closed
with
him
directly
,
threw
down
the
money
,
and
the
carriage
was
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Catherine
,
"
I
know
so
little
of
such
things
that
I
can
not
judge
whether
it
was
cheap
or
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
one
nor
t'other
;
I
might
have
got
it
for
less
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
but
I
hate
haggling
,
and
poor
Freeman
wanted
cash
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
very
good
-
natured
of
you
,
"
said
Catherine
,
quite
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
D---
<EOS>
it
,
when
one
has
the
means
of
doing
a
kind
thing
by
a
friend
,
I
hate
to
be
pitiful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
An
inquiry
now
took
place
into
the
intended
movements
of
the
young
ladies
;
and
,
on
finding
whither
they
were
going
,
it
was
decided
that
the
gentlemen
should
accompany
them
to
Edgar
's
Buildings
,
and
pay
their
respects
to
Mrs.
Thorpe
.
<EOS>
James
and
Isabella
led
the
way
;
and
so
well
satisfied
was
the
latter
with
her
lot
,
so
contentedly
was
she
endeavouring
to
ensure
a
pleasant
walk
to
him
who
brought
the
double
recommendation
of
being
her
brother
's
friend
,
and
<EOS>
her
friend
's
brother
,
so
pure
and
uncoquettish
were
her
feelings
,
that
,
though
they
overtook
and
passed
the
two
offending
young
men
in
Milsom
Street
,
she
was
so
far
from
seeking
to
attract
their
notice
,
that
she
looked
back
at
them
only
three
times
.
  
<EOS>
John
Thorpe
kept
of
course
with
Catherine
,
and
,
after
a
few
minutes
'
silence
,
renewed
the
conversation
about
his
gig
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
,
however
,
Miss
Morland
,
it
would
be
reckoned
a
cheap
thing
by
some
people
,
for
I
might
have
sold
it
for
ten
guineas
more
the
next
day
;
Jackson
,
of
Oriel
,
bid
me
sixty
at
once
;
Morland
was
with
me
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Morland
,
who
overheard
this
;
"
but
you
forget
that
your
horse
was
included
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
horse
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
d---
it
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
sell
my
horse
for
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
Are
you
fond
of
an
open
carriage
,
Miss
Morland
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
;
I
have
hardly
ever
an
opportunity
of
being
in
one
;
but
I
am
particularly
fond
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
;
I
will
drive
you
out
in
mine
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Catherine
,
in
some
distress
,
from
a
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
accepting
such
an
offer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
drive
you
up
Lansdown
Hill
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thank
you
;
but
will
not
your
horse
want
rest
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rest
!
<EOS>
He
has
only
come
three
and
twenty
miles
today
;
all
nonsense
;
nothing
ruins
horses
so
much
as
rest
;
nothing
knocks
them
up
so
soon
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
I
shall
exercise
mine
at
the
average
of
four
hours
every
day
while
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
indeed
!
"
said
Catherine
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
That
will
be
forty
miles
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Forty
!
<EOS>
Aye
,
fifty
,
for
what
I
care
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
drive
you
up
Lansdown
tomorrow
;
mind
,
I
am
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
delightful
that
will
be
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Isabella
,
turning
round
.
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Catherine
,
I
quite
envy
you
;
but
I
am
afraid
,
brother
,
you
will
not
have
room
for
a
third
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
third
indeed
!
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
I
did
not
come
to
Bath
to
drive
my
sisters
about
;
that
would
be
a
good
joke
,
faith
!
<EOS>
Morland
must
take
care
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
brought
on
a
dialogue
of
civilities
between
the
other
two
;
but
Catherine
heard
neither
the
particulars
nor
the
result
.
<EOS>
Her
companion
's
discourse
now
sunk
from
its
hitherto
animated
pitch
to
nothing
more
than
a
short
decisive
sentence
of
praise
or
condemnation
on
the
face
of
every
woman
they
met
;
and
Catherine
,
after
listening
and
agreeing
as
long
as
she
could
,
with
all
the
civility
and
deference
of
the
youthful
female
mind
,
fearful
of
hazarding
an
opinion
of
its
own
in
opposition
to
that
of
a
self
-
assured
man
,
especially
where
the
beauty
of
her
own
sex
is
concerned
,
ventured
at
length
to
vary
the
subject
by
a
question
which
had
been
long
uppermost
in
her
thoughts
;
it
was
,
"
Have
you
ever
read
Udolpho
,
Mr.
Thorpe
?
"
  
"
Udolpho
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
Not
I
<EOS>
;
I
never
read
novels
;
I
have
something
else
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
humbled
and
ashamed
,
was
going
to
apologize
for
her
question
,
but
he
prevented
her
by
saying
,
"
Novels
are
all
so
full
of
nonsense
and
stuff
;
there
has
not
been
a
tolerably
decent
one
come
out
since
Tom
Jones
,
except
The
Monk
;
I
read
that
t'other
day
;
but
as
for
all
the
others
,
they
are
the
stupidest
things
in
creation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
must
like
Udolpho
,
if
you
were
to
read
it
;
it
is
so
very
interesting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
faith
!
<EOS>
No
,
if
I
read
any
,
it
shall
be
Mrs.
Radcliffe
's
;
her
novels
are
amusing
enough
;
they
are
worth
reading
;
some
fun
and
nature
in
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Udolpho
was
written
by
Mrs.
Radcliffe
,
"
said
Catherine
,
with
some
hesitation
,
from
the
fear
of
mortifying
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
sure
;
was
it
?
<EOS>
Aye
,
I
remember
,
so
it
was
;
I
was
thinking
of
that
other
stupid
book
,
written
by
that
woman
they
make
such
a
fuss
about
,
she
who
married
the
French
emigrant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
mean
Camilla
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
's
the
book
;
such
unnatural
stuff
!
<EOS>
An
old
man
playing
at
see
-
saw
,
I
took
up
the
first
volume
once
and
looked
it
over
,
but
I
soon
found
it
would
not
do
;
indeed
I
guessed
what
sort
of
stuff
it
must
be
before
I
saw
it
:
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
heard
she
had
married
an
emigrant
,
I
was
sure
I
should
never
be
able
to
get
through
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
no
loss
,
I
assure
you
;
it
is
the
horridest
nonsense
you
can
imagine
;
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
in
it
but
an
old
man
's
playing
at
see
-
saw
and
learning
Latin
;
upon
my
soul
there
is
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
critique
,
the
justness
of
which
was
unfortunately
lost
on
poor
Catherine
,
brought
them
to
the
door
of
Mrs.
Thorpe
's
lodgings
,
and
the
feelings
of
the
discerning
and
unprejudiced
reader
of
Camilla
gave
way
to
the
feelings
of
the
dutiful
and
affectionate
son
,
as
they
met
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
who
had
descried
them
from
above
,
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
Mother
!
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
giving
her
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
get
that
quiz
of
a
hat
?
<EOS>
It
makes
you
look
like
an
old
witch
.
<EOS>
Here
is
Morland
<EOS>
and
I
come
to
stay
a
few
days
with
you
,
so
you
must
look
out
for
a
couple
of
good
beds
somewhere
near
.
"
<EOS>
And
this
address
seemed
to
satisfy
all
the
fondest
wishes
of
the
mother
's
heart
,
for
she
received
him
with
the
most
delighted
and
exulting
affection
.
<EOS>
On
his
two
younger
sisters
he
then
bestowed
an
equal
portion
of
his
fraternal
tenderness
,
for
he
asked
each
of
them
how
they
did
,
and
observed
that
they
both
looked
very
ugly
.
  
<EOS>
These
manners
did
not
please
Catherine
;
but
he
was
James
's
friend
and
Isabella
's
brother
;
and
her
judgment
was
further
bought
off
by
Isabella
's
assuring
her
,
<EOS>
when
they
withdrew
to
see
the
new
hat
,
that
John
thought
her
the
most
charming
girl
in
the
world
,
and
by
John
's
engaging
her
before
they
parted
to
dance
with
him
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
older
or
vainer
,
such
attacks
might
have
done
little
;
but
,
where
youth
and
diffidence
are
united
,
it
requires
uncommon
steadiness
of
reason
to
resist
the
attraction
of
being
called
the
most
charming
girl
in
the
world
,
and
of
being
so
very
early
engaged
as
a
partner
;
and
the
consequence
was
that
,
when
the
two
Morlands
,
after
sitting
an
hour
with
the
Thorpes
,
set
off
to
walk
together
to
Mr.
Allen
's
,
and
James
,
as
the
door
was
closed
on
them
,
said
,
"
Well
,
Catherine
,
how
do
you
like
my
friend
Thorpe
?
"
<EOS>
instead
of
answering
,
as
she
probably
would
have
done
,
had
there
been
no
friendship
and
no
flattery
in
the
case
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
him
at
all
,
"
she
directly
replied
,
"
I
like
him
very
much
;
he
seems
very
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
as
good
-
natured
a
fellow
as
ever
lived
;
a
little
of
a
rattle
;
but
that
will
recommend
him
to
your
sex
,
I
believe
:
and
how
do
you
like
the
rest
of
the
family
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
,
very
much
indeed
<EOS>
:
Isabella
particularly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
;
she
is
just
the
kind
of
young
woman
I
could
wish
to
see
you
attached
to
;
she
has
so
much
good
sense
,
and
is
so
thoroughly
unaffected
and
amiable
;
I
always
wanted
you
to
know
her
;
and
she
seems
very
fond
of
you
.
<EOS>
She
said
the
highest
things
in
your
praise
that
could
possibly
be
;
and
the
praise
of
such
a
girl
as
Miss
Thorpe
even
you
,
Catherine
,
"
taking
her
hand
with
affection
,
"
may
be
proud
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
,
"
she
replied
;
"
I
love
her
exceedingly
,
and
am
delighted
to
find
that
you
like
her
too
.
<EOS>
You
hardly
mentioned
anything
of
her
when
you
wrote
to
me
after
your
visit
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
thought
I
should
soon
see
you
myself
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
a
great
deal
together
while
you
are
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
most
amiable
girl
;
such
a
superior
understanding
!
<EOS>
How
fond
all
the
family
are
of
her
;
she
is
evidently
the
general
favourite
;
and
how
much
she
must
be
admired
in
such
a
place
as
this
 
is
not
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
much
indeed
,
I
fancy
;
Mr.
Allen
thinks
her
the
prettiest
girl
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
does
;
and
I
do
not
know
any
man
who
is
a
better
judge
of
beauty
than
Mr.
Allen
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
ask
you
whether
you
are
happy
here
,
my
dear
Catherine
;
with
such
a
companion
and
friend
as
Isabella
Thorpe
,
it
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
be
otherwise
;
and
the
Allens
,
I
am
sure
,
are
very
kind
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
kind
;
I
never
was
so
happy
before
;
and
now
you
are
come
it
will
be
more
delightful
than
ever
;
how
good
it
is
of
you
to
come
so
far
on
purpose
to
see
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
James
accepted
this
tribute
of
gratitude
,
and
qualified
his
conscience
for
accepting
it
too
,
by
saying
with
perfect
sincerity
,
"
Indeed
,
Catherine
,
I
love
you
dearly
.

Inquiries
and
communications
concerning
brothers
and
sisters
,
the
situation
of
some
,
the
growth
of
the
rest
,
and
other
family
matters
now
passed
between
them
,
and
continued
,
with
only
one
small
digression
on
James
's
part
,
in
praise
of
Miss
Thorpe
,
till
they
reached
Pulteney
Street
,
where
he
was
welcomed
with
great
kindness
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
invited
by
the
former
to
dine
with
them
,
and
summoned
by
the
latter
to
guess
the
price
and
weigh
the
merits
of
a
new
muff
and
tippet
.
<EOS>
A
pre
-
engagement
in
Edgar
's
Buildings
prevented
his
accepting
the
invitation
of
one
friend
,
and
obliged
him
to
hurry
away
as
soon
as
he
had
satisfied
the
demands
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
time
of
the
two
parties
uniting
in
the
Octagon
Room
being
correctly
adjusted
,
Catherine
was
then
left
to
the
luxury
of
a
raised
,
restless
,
and
frightened
imagination
over
the
pages
of
Udolpho
,
lost
from
all
worldly
concerns
of
dressing
and
dinner
,
incapable
of
soothing
Mrs.
Allen
's
fears
on
the
delay
of
an
expected
dressmaker
,
and
having
only
one
minute
in
sixty
to
bestow
even
on
the
reflection
of
her
own
felicity
,
in
being
already
engaged
for
the
evening
.
    
<EOS>
In
spite
of
Udolpho
and
the
dressmaker
,
however
,
the
party
from
Pulteney
Street
reached
the
Upper
Rooms
in
very
good
time
.
<EOS>
The
Thorpes
and
James
Morland
were
there
only
two
minutes
before
them
;
and
Isabella
having
gone
through
the
usual
ceremonial
of
meeting
her
friend
with
the
most
smiling
and
affectionate
haste
,
of
admiring
the
set
of
her
gown
,
and
envying
the
curl
of
her
hair
,
they
followed
their
chaperones
,
arm
in
arm
,
into
the
ballroom
,
whispering
to
each
other
whenever
a
thought
occurred
,
and
supplying
the
place
of
many
ideas
by
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
or
a
smile
of
affection
.
  
<EOS>
The
dancing
began
within
a
few
minutes
after
they
were
seated
;
and
James
,
who
had
been
engaged
quite
as
long
as
his
sister
,
was
very
importunate
with
Isabella
to
stand
up
;
but
John
was
gone
into
the
card
-
room
to
speak
to
a
friend
,
and
nothing
,
she
declared
,
should
induce
her
to
join
the
set
before
her
dear
Catherine
could
join
it
too
.
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
would
not
stand
up
without
your
dear
sister
for
all
the
world
;
for
if
I
did
we
should
certainly
be
separated
the
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
accepted
this
kindness
with
gratitude
,
and
they
continued
as
they
were
for
three
minutes
longer
,
when
Isabella
,
who
had
been
talking
to
James
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
turned
again
to
his
sister
and
whispered
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
creature
,
I
am
afraid
I
must
leave
you
,
your
brother
is
so
amazingly
impatient
to
begin
;
I
know
you
will
not
mind
my
going
away
,
and
I
dare
say
John
will
be
back
in
a
moment
,
and
then
you
may
easily
find
me
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
,
though
a
little
disappointed
,
had
too
much
good
nature
to
make
any
opposition
,
and
the
others
rising
up
,
Isabella
had
only
time
to
press
her
friend
's
hand
and
say
,
"
Good
-
bye
,
my
dear
love
,
"
before
they
hurried
off
.
<EOS>
The
younger
Miss
Thorpes
being
also
dancing
,
Catherine
was
left
to
the
mercy
of
Mrs.
Thorpe
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
between
whom
she
now
remained
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
being
vexed
at
the
non
-
appearance
of
Mr.
Thorpe
,
for
she
not
only
longed
to
be
dancing
,
but
was
likewise
aware
that
,
as
the
real
dignity
of
her
situation
could
not
be
known
,
she
was
sharing
with
the
scores
of
other
young
ladies
still
sitting
down
all
the
discredit
of
wanting
a
partner
.
<EOS>
To
be
disgraced
in
the
eye
of
the
world
,
to
wear
the
appearance
of
infamy
while
her
heart
is
all
purity
,
her
actions
all
innocence
,
and
the
misconduct
of
another
the
true
source
of
her
debasement
,
is
one
of
those
circumstances
which
peculiarly
belong
to
the
heroine
's
life
,
and
her
fortitude
under
it
<EOS>
what
particularly
dignifies
her
character
.
<EOS>
Catherine
had
fortitude
too
;
she
suffered
,
but
no
murmur
passed
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
state
of
humiliation
,
she
was
roused
,
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
,
to
a
pleasanter
feeling
,
by
seeing
,
not
Mr.
Thorpe
,
but
Mr.
Tilney
,
within
three
yards
of
the
place
where
they
sat
;
he
seemed
to
be
moving
that
way
,
but
he
did
not
see
her
,
and
therefore
the
smile
and
the
blush
,
which
his
sudden
reappearance
raised
in
Catherine
,
passed
away
without
sullying
her
heroic
importance
.
<EOS>
He
looked
as
handsome
and
as
lively
as
ever
,
and
was
talking
with
interest
to
a
fashionable
and
pleasing
-
looking
young
woman
,
who
leant
on
his
arm
,
and
whom
Catherine
immediately
guessed
to
be
his
sister
;
thus
unthinkingly
throwing
away
a
fair
opportunity
of
considering
him
lost
to
her
forever
,
by
being
married
already
.
<EOS>
But
guided
only
by
what
was
simple
and
probable
,
it
had
never
entered
her
head
that
Mr.
Tilney
could
be
married
;
he
had
not
behaved
,
he
had
not
talked
,
like
the
married
men
to
whom
she
had
been
used
;
he
had
never
mentioned
a
wife
,
and
he
had
acknowledged
a
sister
.
<EOS>
From
these
circumstances
sprang
the
instant
conclusion
of
his
sister
's
now
being
by
his
side
;
and
therefore
,
instead
of
turning
of
a
deathlike
paleness
and
falling
in
a
fit
on
Mrs.
Allen
's
bosom
,
Catherine
sat
erect
,
in
the
perfect
use
of
her
senses
,
and
with
cheeks
only
a
little
redder
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
and
his
companion
,
who
continued
,
though
slowly
,
to
approach
,
were
immediately
preceded
by
a
lady
,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Thorpe
;
and
this
lady
stopping
to
speak
to
her
,
they
,
as
belonging
to
her
,
stopped
likewise
,
and
Catherine
,
catching
Mr.
Tilney
's
eye
,
instantly
received
from
him
the
smiling
tribute
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
She
returned
it
with
pleasure
,
and
then
advancing
still
nearer
,
he
spoke
both
to
her
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
by
whom
he
was
very
civilly
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
to
see
you
again
,
sir
,
indeed
;
I
was
afraid
you
had
left
Bath
.
"
<EOS>
He
thanked
her
for
her
fears
,
and
said
that
he
had
quitted
it
for
a
week
,
on
the
very
morning
after
his
having
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
and
I
dare
say
you
are
not
sorry
to
be
back
again
,
for
it
is
just
the
place
for
young
people
 
and
indeed
for
everybody
else
too
.
<EOS>
I
tell
Mr.
Allen
,
when
he
talks
of
being
sick
of
it
,
that
I
am
sure
he
should
not
complain
,
for
it
is
so
very
agreeable
<EOS>
a
place
,
that
it
is
much
better
to
be
here
than
at
home
at
this
dull
time
of
year
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
is
quite
in
luck
to
be
sent
here
for
his
health
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
hope
,
madam
,
that
Mr.
Allen
will
be
obliged
to
like
the
place
,
from
finding
it
of
service
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
.
<EOS>
A
neighbour
of
ours
,
Dr.
Skinner
,
was
here
for
his
health
last
winter
,
and
came
away
quite
stout
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
circumstance
must
give
great
encouragement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
 
and
Dr.
Skinner
and
his
family
were
here
three
months
;
so
I
tell
Mr.
Allen
he
must
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
they
were
interrupted
by
a
request
from
Mrs.
Thorpe
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
that
she
would
move
a
little
to
accommodate
Mrs.
Hughes
and
Miss
Tilney
with
seats
,
as
they
had
agreed
to
join
their
party
.
<EOS>
This
was
accordingly
done
,
Mr.
Tilney
still
continuing
standing
before
them
;
and
after
a
few
minutes
'
consideration
,
he
asked
Catherine
to
dance
with
him
.
<EOS>
This
compliment
,
delightful
as
it
was
,
produced
severe
mortification
to
the
lady
;
and
in
giving
her
denial
,
she
expressed
her
sorrow
on
the
occasion
so
very
much
as
if
she
really
felt
it
that
had
<EOS>
Thorpe
,
who
joined
her
just
afterwards
,
been
half
a
minute
earlier
,
he
might
have
thought
her
sufferings
rather
too
acute
.
<EOS>
The
very
easy
manner
in
which
he
then
told
her
that
he
had
kept
her
waiting
did
not
by
any
means
reconcile
her
more
to
her
lot
;
nor
did
the
particulars
which
he
entered
into
while
they
were
standing
up
,
of
the
horses
and
dogs
of
the
friend
whom
he
had
just
left
,
and
of
a
proposed
exchange
of
terriers
between
them
,
interest
her
so
much
as
to
prevent
her
looking
very
often
towards
that
part
of
the
room
where
she
had
left
Mr.
Tilney
.
<EOS>
Of
her
dear
Isabella
,
to
whom
she
particularly
longed
to
point
out
that
gentleman
,
she
could
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
different
sets
.
<EOS>
She
was
separated
from
all
her
party
,
and
away
from
all
her
acquaintance
;
one
mortification
succeeded
another
,
and
from
the
whole
she
deduced
this
useful
lesson
,
that
to
go
previously
engaged
to
a
ball
does
not
necessarily
increase
either
the
dignity
or
enjoyment
of
a
young
lady
.
<EOS>
From
such
a
moralizing
strain
as
this
,
she
was
suddenly
roused
by
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
,
and
turning
round
,
perceived
Mrs.
Hughes
directly
behind
her
,
attended
by
Miss
Tilney
and
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Morland
,
"
said
she
,
"
for
this
liberty
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
anyhow
get
to
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
said
she
was
sure
you
would
not
have
the
least
objection
to
letting
in
this
young
lady
by
you
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hughes
could
not
have
applied
to
any
creature
in
the
room
more
happy
to
oblige
her
than
Catherine
.
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
were
introduced
to
each
other
,
Miss
Tilney
expressing
a
proper
sense
of
such
goodness
,
Miss
Morland
with
the
real
delicacy
of
a
generous
mind
making
light
of
the
obligation
;
and
Mrs.
Hughes
,
satisfied
with
having
so
respectably
settled
her
young
charge
,
returned
to
her
party
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
had
a
good
figure
,
a
pretty
face
,
and
a
very
agreeable
countenance
;
and
her
air
,
though
it
had
not
all
the
decided
pretension
,
<EOS>
the
resolute
stylishness
of
Miss
Thorpe
's
,
had
more
real
elegance
.
<EOS>
Her
manners
showed
good
sense
and
good
breeding
;
they
were
neither
shy
nor
affectedly
open
;
and
she
seemed
capable
of
being
young
,
attractive
,
and
at
a
ball
without
wanting
to
fix
the
attention
of
every
man
near
her
,
and
without
exaggerated
feelings
of
ecstatic
delight
or
inconceivable
vexation
on
every
little
trifling
occurrence
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
interested
at
once
by
her
appearance
and
her
relationship
to
Mr.
Tilney
,
was
desirous
of
being
acquainted
with
her
,
and
readily
talked
therefore
whenever
she
could
think
of
anything
to
say
,
and
had
courage
and
leisure
for
saying
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
hindrance
thrown
in
the
way
of
a
very
speedy
intimacy
,
by
the
frequent
want
of
one
or
more
of
these
requisites
,
prevented
their
doing
more
than
going
through
the
first
rudiments
of
an
acquaintance
,
by
informing
themselves
how
well
the
other
liked
Bath
<EOS>
,
how
much
she
admired
its
buildings
and
surrounding
country
,
whether
she
drew
,
or
played
,
or
sang
,
and
whether
she
was
fond
of
riding
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
dances
were
scarcely
concluded
before
Catherine
found
her
arm
gently
seized
by
her
faithful
Isabella
,
who
in
great
spirits
exclaimed
,
"
At
last
I
have
got
you
.
<EOS>
My
dearest
creature
,
I
have
been
looking
for
you
this
hour
.
<EOS>
What
could
induce
you
to
come
into
this
set
,
when
you
knew
I
was
in
the
other
?
<EOS>
I
have
been
quite
wretched
without
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Isabella
,
how
was
it
possible
for
me
to
get
at
you
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
see
where
you
were
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
told
your
brother
all
the
time
 
<EOS>
but
he
would
not
believe
me
.
<EOS>
Do
go
and
see
for
her
,
Mr.
Morland
,
said
I
 
but
<EOS>
all
in
vain
 
he
would
not
stir
an
inch
.
<EOS>
Was
not
it
so
,
Mr.
Morland
?
<EOS>
But
you
men
are
all
so
immoderately
lazy
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
scolding
him
to
such
a
degree
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
you
would
be
quite
amazed
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
never
stand
upon
ceremony
with
such
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
that
young
lady
with
the
white
beads
round
her
head
,
"
whispered
Catherine
,
detaching
her
friend
from
James
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Mr.
Tilney
's
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
say
so
!
<EOS>
Let
me
look
at
her
this
moment
.
<EOS>
What
a
delightful
girl
!
<EOS>
I
never
saw
anything
half
so
beautiful
!
<EOS>
But
where
is
her
all
-
conquering
brother
?
<EOS>
Is
he
in
the
room
?
<EOS>
Point
him
out
to
me
this
instant
,
if
he
is
.
<EOS>
I
die
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Morland
,
you
are
not
to
listen
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
talking
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
all
this
whispering
about
?
<EOS>
What
is
going
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
now
,
I
knew
how
it
would
be
.
<EOS>
You
men
have
such
restless
curiosity
!
<EOS>
Talk
of
the
curiosity
of
women
,
indeed
!
'
<EOS>
tis
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
be
satisfied
,
for
you
are
not
to
know
anything
at
all
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
that
likely
to
satisfy
me
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
declare
I
never
knew
anything
like
you
.
<EOS>
What
can
it
signify
to
you
,
what
we
are
talking
of
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
we
are
talking
about
you
;
therefore
I
would
advise
you
not
to
listen
,
or
you
may
happen
to
hear
something
not
very
agreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
commonplace
chatter
,
which
lasted
some
time
,
the
original
subject
seemed
entirely
forgotten
;
and
though
Catherine
was
very
well
pleased
to
have
it
dropped
for
a
while
,
she
could
not
avoid
a
little
suspicion
at
the
total
suspension
of
all
Isabella
's
impatient
desire
to
see
Mr.
Tilney
.
<EOS>
When
the
orchestra
struck
up
a
fresh
dance
,
James
would
have
led
his
fair
partner
away
,
but
she
resisted
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Mr.
Morland
,
"
she
cried
,
"
I
would
not
do
such
a
thing
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
be
so
teasing
;
only
conceive
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
<EOS>
what
your
brother
wants
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
wants
me
to
dance
with
him
again
,
though
I
tell
him
that
it
is
a
most
improper
thing
,
and
entirely
against
the
rules
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
us
the
talk
of
the
place
,
if
we
were
not
to
change
partners
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
honour
,
"
said
James
,
"
in
these
public
assemblies
,
it
is
as
often
done
as
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
how
can
you
say
so
?
<EOS>
But
when
you
men
have
a
point
to
carry
,
you
never
stick
at
anything
.
<EOS>
My
sweet
Catherine
,
do
support
me
;
persuade
your
brother
how
impossible
it
is
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
it
would
quite
shock
you
to
see
me
do
such
a
thing
;
now
would
not
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
at
all
<EOS>
;
but
if
you
think
it
wrong
,
you
had
much
better
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
cried
Isabella
,
"
you
hear
what
your
sister
says
,
and
yet
you
will
not
mind
her
.
<EOS>
Well
,
remember
that
it
is
not
my
fault
,
if
we
set
all
the
old
ladies
in
Bath
in
a
bustle
.
<EOS>
Come
along
,
my
dearest
Catherine
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
and
stand
by
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
off
they
went
,
to
regain
their
former
place
.
<EOS>
John
Thorpe
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
had
walked
away
;
and
Catherine
,
ever
willing
to
give
Mr.
Tilney
an
opportunity
of
repeating
the
agreeable
request
which
had
already
flattered
her
once
,
made
her
way
to
Mrs.
Allen
and
Mrs.
Thorpe
as
fast
as
she
could
,
in
the
hope
of
finding
him
still
with
them
 
a
hope
which
,
when
it
proved
to
be
fruitless
,
she
felt
to
have
been
highly
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
impatient
for
praise
of
her
son
,
"
I
hope
you
have
had
an
agreeable
partner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
agreeable
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
John
has
charming
spirits
,
has
not
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
meet
Mr.
Tilney
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Mrs.
Allen
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
where
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
with
us
just
now
,
and
said
he
was
so
tired
of
lounging
about
,
that
he
was
resolved
to
go
and
dance
;
<EOS>
so
I
thought
perhaps
he
would
ask
you
,
if
he
met
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
can
he
be
?
"
said
Catherine
,
looking
round
;
but
she
had
not
looked
round
long
before
she
saw
him
leading
a
young
lady
to
the
dance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
He
has
got
a
partner
;
I
wish
he
had
asked
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Allen
;
and
after
a
short
silence
,
she
added
,
"
he
is
a
very
agreeable
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
he
is
,
Mrs.
Allen
,
"
said
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
smiling
complacently
;
"
I
must
say
it
,
though
I
am
his
mother
,
that
there
is
not
a
more
agreeable
young
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
inapplicable
answer
might
have
been
too
much
for
the
comprehension
of
many
;
but
it
did
not
puzzle
Mrs.
Allen
,
for
after
only
a
moment
's
consideration
,
she
said
,
in
a
whisper
to
Catherine
,
"
I
dare
say
she
thought
I
was
speaking
of
her
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
was
disappointed
and
vexed
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
have
missed
by
so
little
<EOS>
the
very
object
she
had
had
in
view
;
and
this
persuasion
did
not
incline
her
to
a
very
gracious
reply
,
when
John
Thorpe
came
up
to
her
soon
afterwards
and
said
,
"
Well
,
Miss
Morland
,
I
suppose
you
and
I
are
to
stand
up
and
jig
it
together
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
our
two
dances
are
over
;
and
,
besides
,
I
am
tired
,
and
do
not
mean
to
dance
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
you
?
<EOS>
Then
let
us
walk
about
and
quiz
people
.
<EOS>
Come
along
with
me
,
and
I
will
show
you
the
four
greatest
quizzers
in
the
room
;
my
two
younger
sisters
and
their
partners
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
laughing
at
them
this
half
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
Catherine
excused
herself
;
and
at
last
he
walked
off
to
quiz
his
sisters
by
himself
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
evening
she
found
very
dull
;
Mr.
Tilney
was
drawn
away
from
their
party
at
tea
,
to
attend
that
of
his
partner
;
Miss
Tilney
,
though
belonging
to
it
,
did
not
sit
near
her
,
and
James
and
Isabella
were
so
much
engaged
in
conversing
together
that
the
latter
had
no
leisure
to
bestow
more
on
her
friend
than
one
smile
,
one
squeeze
,
and
one
"
dearest
Catherine
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
progress
of
Catherine
's
unhappiness
from
the
events
of
the
evening
was
as
follows
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
first
in
a
general
dissatisfaction
with
everybody
about
her
,
while
she
remained
in
the
rooms
,
which
speedily
brought
on
considerable
weariness
and
a
violent
desire
to
go
home
.
<EOS>
This
,
on
arriving
in
Pulteney
Street
,
took
the
direction
of
extraordinary
hunger
,
and
when
that
was
appeased
,
changed
into
an
earnest
longing
to
be
in
bed
;
such
was
the
extreme
point
of
her
distress
;
for
when
there
she
immediately
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
which
lasted
nine
hours
,
and
from
which
she
awoke
perfectly
revived
,
in
excellent
spirits
,
with
fresh
hopes
and
fresh
schemes
.
<EOS>
The
first
wish
of
her
heart
was
to
improve
her
acquaintance
with
Miss
Tilney
,
and
almost
her
first
resolution
,
to
seek
her
for
that
purpose
,
in
the
pump
-
room
at
noon
.
<EOS>
In
the
pump
-
room
,
one
so
newly
arrived
in
Bath
must
be
met
with
,
and
that
building
she
had
already
found
so
favourable
for
the
discovery
of
female
excellence
,
and
the
completion
of
female
intimacy
,
so
admirably
adapted
for
secret
discourses
and
unlimited
confidence
,
that
she
was
most
reasonably
encouraged
to
expect
another
friend
from
within
its
walls
.
<EOS>
Her
plan
for
the
morning
thus
settled
,
she
sat
quietly
down
to
her
book
after
breakfast
,
resolving
to
remain
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
employment
till
the
clock
struck
one
;
and
from
habitude
very
little
incommoded
by
the
remarks
and
ejaculations
of
Mrs.
Allen
,
whose
vacancy
of
mind
and
incapacity
for
thinking
were
such
,
that
as
she
never
talked
a
great
deal
,
so
she
could
never
be
entirely
silent
;
and
,
therefore
,
while
she
sat
at
her
work
,
if
she
lost
her
needle
or
broke
her
thread
,
if
she
heard
a
carriage
in
the
street
,
or
saw
a
speck
upon
her
gown
,
she
must
observe
it
aloud
,
whether
there
were
anyone
at
leisure
to
answer
her
or
not
.
<EOS>
At
about
half
past
twelve
,
a
remarkably
loud
rap
drew
her
in
haste
to
the
window
,
and
scarcely
had
she
time
to
inform
Catherine
of
there
being
two
open
carriages
at
the
door
,
in
the
first
only
a
servant
,
her
brother
driving
Miss
Thorpe
in
the
second
,
before
John
Thorpe
came
running
upstairs
,
calling
out
,
"
Well
,
Miss
Morland
,
here
I
am
.
<EOS>
Have
you
been
waiting
long
?
<EOS>
We
could
not
come
before
;
the
old
devil
of
a
coachmaker
was
such
an
eternity
finding
out
a
thing
fit
to
be
got
into
,
and
now
it
is
ten
thousand
to
one
<EOS>
but
they
break
down
before
we
are
out
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Allen
?
<EOS>
A
famous
ball
last
night
,
was
not
it
?
<EOS>
Come
,
Miss
Morland
,
be
quick
,
for
the
others
are
in
a
confounded
hurry
to
be
off
.
<EOS>
They
want
to
get
their
tumble
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
all
going
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Going
to
?
<EOS>
Why
,
you
have
not
forgot
our
engagement
!
<EOS>
Did
not
we
agree
together
to
take
a
drive
this
morning
?
<EOS>
What
a
head
you
have
!
<EOS>
We
are
going
up
Claverton
Down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
was
said
about
it
,
I
remember
,
"
said
Catherine
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Allen
for
her
opinion
;
"
but
really
I
did
not
expect
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
expect
me
!
<EOS>
That
's
a
good
one
!
<EOS>
And
what
a
dust
you
would
have
made
,
if
I
had
not
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
silent
appeal
to
her
friend
,
meanwhile
,
was
entirely
thrown
away
,
for
Mrs.
Allen
,
not
being
at
all
in
the
habit
of
conveying
any
expression
herself
by
a
look
,
was
not
aware
of
its
being
ever
intended
by
anybody
else
;
and
Catherine
,
whose
desire
of
seeing
Miss
Tilney
again
could
at
that
moment
bear
a
short
delay
in
favour
of
a
drive
,
and
who
thought
there
could
be
no
impropriety
in
her
going
with
Mr.
Thorpe
,
as
Isabella
was
going
at
the
same
time
with
James
,
was
therefore
obliged
to
speak
plainer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
ma'am
,
what
do
you
say
to
it
?
<EOS>
Can
you
spare
me
for
an
hour
or
two
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
just
as
you
please
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Allen
,
with
the
most
placid
indifference
.
<EOS>
Catherine
took
the
advice
,
and
ran
off
to
get
ready
.
<EOS>
In
a
very
few
minutes
she
reappeared
,
having
scarcely
allowed
the
two
others
time
enough
to
get
through
a
few
short
sentences
in
her
praise
,
after
Thorpe
had
procured
Mrs.
Allen
's
admiration
of
his
gig
;
and
then
receiving
her
friend
's
parting
good
wishes
,
they
both
hurried
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
creature
,
"
cried
Isabella
,
to
whom
the
duty
of
friendship
immediately
called
her
before
she
could
get
into
the
carriage
,
"
you
have
been
at
least
three
hours
getting
ready
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
you
were
ill
.
<EOS>
What
a
delightful
ball
we
had
last
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
thousand
things
to
say
to
you
;
but
make
haste
and
get
in
,
for
I
long
to
be
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
followed
her
orders
and
turned
away
,
but
not
too
soon
to
hear
her
friend
exclaim
aloud
to
James
,
"
What
a
sweet
girl
she
is
!
<EOS>
I
quite
dote
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
frightened
,
Miss
Morland
,
"
said
Thorpe
,
as
he
handed
her
in
,
"
if
my
horse
should
dance
about
a
little
at
first
setting
off
.
<EOS>
He
will
,
most
likely
,
give
a
plunge
or
two
,
and
perhaps
take
the
rest
for
a
minute
;
but
he
will
soon
know
his
master
.
<EOS>
He
is
full
of
spirits
,
playful
as
can
be
,
but
there
is
no
vice
in
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
did
not
think
the
portrait
a
very
inviting
one
,
but
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
,
and
she
was
too
young
to
own
herself
frightened
;
so
,
resigning
herself
to
her
fate
,
and
trusting
to
the
animal
's
boasted
knowledge
of
its
owner
,
she
sat
peaceably
down
,
and
saw
Thorpe
sit
down
by
her
.
<EOS>
Everything
being
then
arranged
,
the
servant
who
stood
at
the
horse
's
head
was
bid
in
an
important
voice
"
to
let
him
go
,
"
and
off
they
went
in
the
quietest
manner
imaginable
,
without
a
plunge
or
a
caper
,
or
anything
like
one
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
delighted
at
so
happy
an
escape
,
spoke
her
pleasure
aloud
with
grateful
surprise
;
and
her
companion
immediately
made
the
matter
perfectly
simple
by
assuring
her
that
it
was
entirely
owing
to
the
peculiarly
judicious
manner
in
which
he
had
then
held
the
reins
,
and
the
singular
discernment
and
dexterity
with
which
he
had
directed
his
whip
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
though
she
could
not
help
wondering
that
with
such
perfect
command
of
his
horse
,
he
should
think
it
necessary
to
alarm
her
with
a
relation
of
its
tricks
,
congratulated
herself
sincerely
on
being
under
the
care
of
so
excellent
a
coachman
;
and
perceiving
that
the
animal
continued
to
go
on
in
the
same
quiet
manner
,
without
showing
the
smallest
propensity
towards
any
unpleasant
vivacity
,
and
(
considering
its
inevitable
pace
was
ten
miles
an
hour
)
by
no
means
alarmingly
fast
,
gave
herself
up
to
all
the
enjoyment
of
air
and
exercise
of
the
most
invigorating
kind
,
in
a
fine
mild
day
of
February
,
with
the
consciousness
of
safety
.
<EOS>
A
silence
of
several
minutes
succeeded
their
first
short
dialogue
;
it
was
broken
by
Thorpe
's
saying
very
abruptly
,
"
Old
Allen
is
as
rich
as
a
Jew
 
<EOS>
is
not
he
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
did
not
understand
him
 
and
he
repeated
his
question
,
adding
in
explanation
,
"
Old
Allen
,
the
man
you
are
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
believe
,
he
is
very
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
no
children
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
not
any
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
famous
thing
for
his
next
heirs
.
<EOS>
He
is
your
godfather
,
is
not
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
godfather
!
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
always
very
much
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
that
is
what
I
meant
.
<EOS>
He
seems
a
good
kind
of
old
fellow
enough
,
and
has
lived
very
well
in
his
time
,
I
dare
say
;
he
is
not
gouty
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Does
he
drink
his
bottle
a
day
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
bottle
a
day
!
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
think
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
He
is
a
very
temperate
man
,
and
you
could
not
fancy
him
in
liquor
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
help
you
!
<EOS>
You
women
are
always
thinking
of
men
's
being
in
liquor
.
<EOS>
Why
,
you
do
not
suppose
a
man
is
overset
by
a
bottle
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
this
 
that
if
everybody
was
to
drink
their
bottle
a
day
,
there
would
not
be
half
the
disorders
in
the
world
there
are
now
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
famous
good
thing
for
us
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Lord
,
it
would
be
the
saving
of
thousands
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
the
hundredth
part
of
the
wine
consumed
in
this
kingdom
that
there
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
Our
foggy
climate
wants
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
I
have
heard
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
wine
drunk
in
Oxford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oxford
!
<EOS>
There
is
no
drinking
at
Oxford
now
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Nobody
drinks
there
.
<EOS>
You
would
hardly
meet
with
a
man
who
goes
beyond
his
four
pints
at
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
Now
,
for
instance
,
it
was
reckoned
a
remarkable
thing
,
at
the
last
party
in
my
rooms
,
that
upon
an
average
we
cleared
about
five
pints
a
head
.
<EOS>
It
was
looked
upon
as
something
out
of
the
common
way
.
<EOS>
Mine
is
famous
good
stuff
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
often
meet
with
anything
like
it
in
Oxford
 
and
that
may
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
this
will
just
give
you
a
notion
of
the
general
rate
of
drinking
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
does
give
a
notion
,
"
said
Catherine
warmly
,
"
and
that
is
,
that
you
all
drink
a
great
deal
more
wine
than
I
thought
you
did
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
am
sure
James
does
not
drink
so
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
declaration
brought
on
a
loud
and
overpowering
reply
,
of
which
no
part
was
very
distinct
,
except
the
frequent
exclamations
,
amounting
almost
to
oaths
,
which
adorned
it
,
and
Catherine
was
left
,
when
it
ended
,
with
rather
a
strengthened
belief
of
there
being
a
great
deal
of
wine
drunk
in
Oxford
,
and
the
same
happy
conviction
of
her
brother
's
comparative
sobriety
.
  
<EOS>
Thorpe
's
ideas
then
all
reverted
to
the
merits
of
his
own
equipage
,
and
she
was
called
on
to
admire
the
spirit
and
freedom
with
which
his
horse
moved
along
,
and
the
ease
which
his
paces
,
as
well
as
the
excellence
of
the
springs
,
gave
the
motion
of
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
She
followed
him
in
all
his
admiration
as
well
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
To
go
before
or
beyond
him
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
His
knowledge
and
her
ignorance
of
the
subject
,
his
rapidity
of
expression
,
and
her
diffidence
of
herself
put
that
out
of
her
power
;
she
could
strike
out
nothing
new
in
commendation
,
but
she
readily
echoed
whatever
he
chose
to
assert
,
and
it
was
finally
settled
between
them
without
any
difficulty
that
his
equipage
was
altogether
the
most
complete
of
its
kind
in
England
,
his
carriage
the
neatest
,
his
horse
the
best
goer
,
and
himself
the
best
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
really
think
,
Mr.
Thorpe
,
"
said
Catherine
,
venturing
after
some
time
to
consider
the
matter
as
entirely
decided
,
and
to
offer
some
little
variation
on
the
subject
,
"
that
James
's
gig
will
break
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Break
down
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
little
tittuppy
thing
in
your
life
?
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
sound
piece
of
iron
about
it
.
<EOS>
The
wheels
have
been
fairly
worn
out
these
ten
years
at
least
 
and
as
for
the
body
!
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
,
you
might
shake
it
to
pieces
yourself
with
a
touch
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
most
devilish
little
rickety
business
I
ever
beheld
!
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
<EOS>
we
have
got
a
better
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
bound
to
go
two
miles
in
it
for
fifty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
"
cried
Catherine
,
quite
frightened
.
"
<EOS>
Then
pray
let
us
turn
back
;
they
will
certainly
meet
with
an
accident
if
we
go
on
.
<EOS>
Do
let
us
turn
back
,
Mr.
Thorpe
;
stop
and
speak
to
my
brother
,
and
tell
him
how
very
unsafe
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unsafe
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
lord
!
<EOS>
What
is
there
in
that
?
<EOS>
They
will
only
get
a
roll
if
it
does
break
down
;
and
there
is
plenty
of
dirt
;
it
will
be
excellent
falling
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
curse
it
!
<EOS>
The
carriage
is
safe
enough
,
if
a
man
knows
how
to
drive
it
;
a
thing
of
that
sort
in
good
hands
will
last
above
twenty
years
after
it
is
fairly
worn
out
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
!
<EOS>
I
would
undertake
for
five
pounds
to
drive
it
to
York
and
back
again
,
without
losing
a
nail
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
listened
with
astonishment
;
she
knew
not
how
to
reconcile
two
such
very
different
accounts
of
the
same
thing
;
for
she
had
not
been
brought
up
to
understand
the
propensities
of
a
rattle
,
nor
to
know
to
how
many
idle
assertions
and
impudent
falsehoods
the
excess
of
vanity
will
lead
.
<EOS>
Her
own
family
were
plain
,
matter
-
of
-
fact
people
who
seldom
aimed
at
wit
of
any
kind
;
her
father
,
at
the
utmost
,
being
contented
with
a
pun
,
and
her
mother
with
a
proverb
;
they
were
not
in
the
habit
therefore
of
telling
lies
to
increase
their
importance
,
or
of
asserting
at
one
moment
what
they
would
contradict
the
next
.
<EOS>
She
reflected
on
the
affair
for
some
time
in
much
perplexity
,
and
was
more
than
once
on
the
point
of
requesting
from
Mr.
Thorpe
a
clearer
insight
into
his
real
opinion
on
the
subject
;
but
she
checked
herself
,
because
it
appeared
to
her
that
he
did
not
excel
in
giving
those
clearer
insights
,
in
making
those
things
plain
which
he
had
before
made
ambiguous
;
and
,
joining
to
this
,
the
consideration
that
he
would
not
really
suffer
his
sister
and
his
friend
to
be
exposed
to
a
danger
from
which
he
might
easily
preserve
them
,
she
concluded
at
last
that
he
must
know
the
carriage
to
be
in
fact
perfectly
safe
,
and
therefore
would
alarm
herself
no
longer
.
<EOS>
By
him
the
whole
matter
seemed
entirely
forgotten
;
and
all
the
rest
of
his
conversation
,
or
rather
talk
,
began
and
ended
with
himself
and
his
own
concerns
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
of
horses
which
he
had
bought
for
a
trifle
and
sold
for
incredible
sums
;
of
racing
matches
,
in
which
his
judgment
had
infallibly
foretold
the
winner
;
of
shooting
parties
,
in
which
he
had
killed
more
birds
(
though
without
having
one
good
shot
)
than
all
his
companions
together
;
and
described
to
her
some
famous
day
's
sport
,
with
the
fox
-
hounds
,
in
which
his
foresight
and
skill
in
directing
the
dogs
had
repaired
the
mistakes
of
the
most
experienced
huntsman
,
and
in
which
the
boldness
of
his
riding
,
though
it
had
never
endangered
his
own
life
for
a
moment
,
had
been
constantly
leading
others
into
difficulties
,
which
he
calmly
concluded
had
broken
the
necks
of
many
.
  
<EOS>
Little
as
Catherine
was
in
the
habit
of
judging
for
herself
,
and
unfixed
as
were
her
general
notions
of
what
men
ought
to
be
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
entirely
repress
a
doubt
,
while
she
bore
with
the
effusions
of
his
endless
conceit
,
of
his
being
altogether
completely
agreeable
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
bold
surmise
,
for
he
was
Isabella
's
brother
;
and
she
had
been
assured
by
James
that
his
manners
would
recommend
him
to
all
her
sex
;
but
in
spite
of
this
,
the
extreme
weariness
of
his
company
,
which
crept
over
her
before
they
had
been
out
an
hour
,
and
which
continued
unceasingly
to
increase
till
they
stopped
in
Pulteney
Street
again
,
induced
her
,
in
some
small
degree
,
to
resist
such
high
authority
,
and
to
distrust
his
powers
of
giving
universal
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
at
Mrs.
Allen
's
door
,
the
astonishment
of
Isabella
was
hardly
to
be
expressed
,
on
finding
that
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
for
them
to
attend
her
friend
into
the
house
:
"
<EOS>
Past
three
o'clock
!
<EOS>
"
It
was
inconceivable
,
incredible
,
impossible
!
<EOS>
And
she
would
neither
believe
her
own
watch
,
nor
her
brother
's
,
nor
the
servant
's
;
she
would
believe
no
assurance
of
it
founded
on
reason
or
reality
,
till
Morland
produced
his
watch
,
and
ascertained
the
fact
;
to
have
doubted
a
moment
longer
then
would
have
been
equally
inconceivable
,
incredible
,
and
impossible
;
and
she
could
only
protest
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
no
two
hours
and
a
half
had
ever
gone
off
so
swiftly
before
,
as
Catherine
was
called
on
to
confirm
<EOS>
;
Catherine
could
not
tell
a
falsehood
even
to
please
Isabella
;
but
the
latter
was
spared
the
misery
of
her
friend
's
dissenting
voice
,
by
not
waiting
for
her
answer
.
<EOS>
Her
own
feelings
entirely
engrossed
her
;
her
wretchedness
was
most
acute
on
finding
herself
obliged
to
go
directly
home
.
<EOS>
It
was
ages
since
she
had
had
a
moment
's
conversation
with
her
dearest
Catherine
;
and
,
though
she
had
such
thousands
of
things
to
say
to
her
,
it
appeared
as
if
they
were
never
to
be
together
again
;
so
,
with
smiles
of
most
exquisite
misery
,
and
the
laughing
eye
of
utter
despondency
,
she
bade
her
friend
adieu
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
found
Mrs.
Allen
just
returned
from
all
the
busy
idleness
of
the
morning
,
and
was
immediately
greeted
with
,
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
here
you
are
,
"
a
truth
which
she
had
no
greater
inclination
than
power
to
dispute
;
"
and
I
hope
you
have
had
a
pleasant
airing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
I
thank
you
;
we
could
not
have
had
a
nicer
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
Mrs.
Thorpe
said
;
she
was
vastly
pleased
at
your
all
going
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
went
to
the
pump
-
room
as
soon
as
you
were
gone
,
and
there
I
met
her
,
and
we
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
together
.
<EOS>
She
says
there
was
hardly
any
veal
to
be
got
at
market
this
morning
,
it
is
so
uncommonly
scarce
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
anybody
else
of
our
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
we
agreed
to
take
a
turn
in
the
Crescent
,
and
there
we
met
Mrs.
Hughes
,
and
Mr.
and
Miss
Tilney
walking
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
indeed
?
<EOS>
And
did
they
speak
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
walked
along
the
Crescent
together
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
They
seem
very
agreeable
people
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
was
in
a
very
pretty
spotted
muslin
,
and
I
fancy
,
by
what
I
can
learn
,
that
she
always
dresses
very
handsomely
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hughes
talked
to
me
a
great
deal
about
the
family
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
she
tell
you
of
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
A
vast
deal
indeed
;
she
hardly
talked
of
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
tell
you
what
part
of
Gloucestershire
they
come
from
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
did
;
but
I
can
not
recollect
now
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
very
good
kind
of
people
,
and
very
rich
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tilney
was
a
Miss
Drummond
,
and
she
and
Mrs.
Hughes
were
schoolfellows
;
and
Miss
Drummond
had
a
very
large
fortune
;
and
,
when
she
married
,
her
father
gave
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
and
five
hundred
to
buy
wedding
-
clothes
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hughes
saw
all
the
clothes
after
they
came
from
the
warehouse
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
are
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Tilney
in
Bath
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
fancy
they
are
,
but
I
am
not
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
Upon
recollection
,
however
,
I
have
a
notion
they
are
both
dead
;
at
least
the
mother
is
;
<EOS>
yes
,
I
am
sure
Mrs.
Tilney
is
dead
,
because
Mrs.
Hughes
told
me
there
was
a
very
beautiful
set
of
pearls
that
Mr.
Drummond
gave
his
daughter
on
her
wedding
-
day
and
that
Miss
Tilney
has
got
now
,
for
they
were
put
by
for
her
when
her
mother
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
is
Mr.
Tilney
,
my
partner
,
the
only
son
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
quite
positive
about
that
,
my
dear
;
I
have
some
idea
he
is
;
but
,
however
,
he
is
a
very
fine
young
man
,
Mrs.
Hughes
says
,
and
likely
to
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
inquired
no
further
;
she
had
heard
enough
to
feel
that
Mrs.
Allen
had
no
real
intelligence
to
give
,
and
that
she
was
most
particularly
unfortunate
herself
in
having
missed
such
a
meeting
with
both
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
Could
she
have
foreseen
such
a
circumstance
,
nothing
should
have
persuaded
her
to
go
out
with
the
others
;
and
,
as
it
was
,
she
could
only
lament
her
ill
luck
,
and
think
over
what
she
had
lost
,
till
it
was
clear
to
her
that
the
drive
had
by
no
means
been
very
pleasant
and
that
John
Thorpe
himself
was
quite
disagreeable
.
    
<EOS>
The
Allens
,
Thorpes
,
and
Morlands
all
met
in
the
evening
at
the
theatre
;
and
,
as
Catherine
and
Isabella
sat
together
,
there
was
then
an
opportunity
for
the
latter
to
utter
some
few
of
the
many
thousand
things
which
had
been
collecting
within
her
for
communication
in
the
immeasurable
length
of
time
which
had
divided
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
heavens
!
<EOS>
My
beloved
Catherine
,
have
I
got
you
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
was
her
address
on
Catherine
's
entering
the
box
and
sitting
by
her
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Morland
,
"
for
he
was
close
to
her
on
the
other
side
,
"
I
shall
not
speak
another
word
to
you
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
;
so
I
charge
you
not
to
expect
it
.
<EOS>
My
sweetest
Catherine
,
how
have
you
been
this
long
age
?
<EOS>
But
I
need
not
ask
you
,
for
you
look
delightfully
.
<EOS>
You
really
have
done
your
hair
in
a
more
heavenly
style
than
ever
;
you
mischievous
creature
,
do
you
want
to
attract
everybody
?
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
my
brother
is
quite
in
love
with
you
already
;
and
as
for
Mr.
Tilney
 
<EOS>
but
that
is
a
settled
thing
 
even
your
modesty
can
not
doubt
his
attachment
now
;
<EOS>
his
coming
back
to
Bath
makes
it
too
plain
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
What
would
not
I
give
to
see
him
!
<EOS>
I
really
am
quite
wild
with
impatience
.
<EOS>
My
mother
says
he
is
the
most
delightful
young
man
in
the
world
;
she
saw
him
this
morning
,
you
know
;
you
must
introduce
him
to
me
.
<EOS>
Is
he
in
the
house
now
?
<EOS>
Look
about
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
can
hardly
exist
till
I
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Catherine
,
"
he
is
not
here
;
I
can
not
see
him
anywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
horrid
!
<EOS>
Am
I
never
to
be
acquainted
with
him
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
like
my
gown
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
does
not
look
amiss
;
the
sleeves
were
entirely
my
own
thought
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
I
get
so
immoderately
sick
of
Bath
;
your
brother
and
I
were
agreeing
this
morning
that
,
though
it
is
vastly
well
to
be
here
for
a
few
weeks
,
we
would
not
live
here
for
millions
.
<EOS>
We
soon
found
out
that
our
tastes
were
exactly
alike
in
preferring
the
country
to
every
other
place
;
really
,
our
opinions
were
so
exactly
the
same
,
it
was
quite
ridiculous
!
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
single
point
in
which
we
differed
;
I
would
not
have
had
you
by
for
the
world
;
you
are
such
a
sly
thing
,
I
am
sure
you
would
have
made
some
droll
remark
or
other
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
I
should
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
you
would
indeed
;
I
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
told
us
that
we
seemed
born
for
each
other
,
or
some
nonsense
of
that
kind
,
which
would
have
distressed
me
beyond
conception
;
my
cheeks
would
have
been
as
red
as
your
roses
;
I
would
not
have
had
you
by
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
do
me
injustice
;
I
would
not
have
made
so
improper
a
remark
upon
any
account
;
and
besides
,
I
am
sure
it
would
never
have
entered
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
smiled
incredulously
and
talked
the
rest
of
the
evening
to
James
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
resolution
of
endeavouring
to
meet
Miss
Tilney
again
continued
in
full
force
the
next
morning
;
and
till
the
usual
moment
of
going
to
the
pump
-
room
,
she
felt
some
alarm
from
the
dread
of
a
second
prevention
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
of
that
kind
occurred
,
no
visitors
appeared
to
delay
them
,
and
they
all
three
set
off
in
good
time
for
the
pump
-
room
,
where
the
ordinary
course
of
events
and
conversation
took
place
;
Mr.
Allen
,
after
drinking
his
glass
of
water
,
joined
some
gentlemen
to
talk
over
the
politics
of
the
day
and
compare
the
accounts
of
their
newspapers
;
and
the
ladies
walked
about
together
,
noticing
every
new
face
,
and
almost
every
new
bonnet
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
female
part
of
the
Thorpe
family
,
attended
by
James
Morland
,
appeared
among
the
crowd
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
Catherine
immediately
took
her
usual
place
by
the
side
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
James
,
who
was
now
in
constant
attendance
,
maintained
a
similar
position
,
and
separating
themselves
from
the
rest
of
their
party
,
they
walked
in
that
manner
for
some
time
,
till
Catherine
began
to
doubt
the
happiness
of
a
situation
which
,
confining
her
entirely
to
her
friend
and
brother
,
gave
her
very
little
share
in
the
notice
of
either
.
<EOS>
They
were
always
engaged
in
some
sentimental
discussion
or
lively
dispute
,
but
their
sentiment
was
conveyed
in
such
whispering
voices
,
and
their
vivacity
attended
with
so
much
laughter
,
that
though
Catherine
's
supporting
opinion
was
not
unfrequently
called
for
by
one
or
the
other
,
she
was
never
able
to
give
any
,
from
not
having
heard
a
word
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
At
length
however
she
was
empowered
to
disengage
herself
from
her
friend
,
by
the
avowed
necessity
of
speaking
to
Miss
Tilney
,
whom
she
most
joyfully
saw
just
entering
the
room
with
Mrs.
Hughes
,
and
whom
she
instantly
joined
,
with
a
firmer
determination
to
be
acquainted
,
than
she
might
have
had
courage
to
command
,
had
she
not
been
urged
by
the
disappointment
of
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
met
her
with
great
civility
,
returned
her
advances
with
equal
goodwill
,
and
they
continued
talking
together
as
long
as
both
parties
remained
in
the
room
;
and
though
in
all
probability
not
an
observation
was
made
,
nor
an
expression
used
by
either
which
had
not
been
made
and
used
some
thousands
of
times
before
,
under
that
roof
,
in
every
Bath
season
,
yet
the
merit
of
their
being
spoken
with
simplicity
and
truth
,
and
without
personal
conceit
,
might
be
something
uncommon
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
well
your
brother
dances
!
<EOS>
"
was
an
artless
exclamation
of
Catherine
's
towards
the
close
of
their
conversation
,
which
at
once
surprised
and
amused
her
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Henry
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
does
dance
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
thought
it
very
odd
to
hear
me
say
I
was
engaged
the
other
evening
,
when
he
saw
me
sitting
down
.
<EOS>
But
I
really
had
been
engaged
the
whole
day
to
Mr.
Thorpe
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
could
only
bow
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
think
,
"
added
Catherine
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
"
how
surprised
I
was
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
I
felt
so
sure
of
his
being
quite
gone
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
Henry
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
,
he
was
in
Bath
but
for
a
couple
of
days
.
<EOS>
He
came
only
to
engage
lodgings
for
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
never
occurred
to
me
;
and
of
course
,
not
seeing
him
anywhere
<EOS>
,
I
thought
he
must
be
gone
.
<EOS>
Was
not
the
young
lady
he
danced
with
on
Monday
a
Miss
Smith
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Hughes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
was
very
glad
to
dance
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
her
pretty
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
very
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
comes
to
the
pump
-
room
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
sometimes
;
but
he
has
rid
out
this
morning
with
my
father
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hughes
now
joined
them
,
and
asked
Miss
Tilney
if
she
was
ready
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
soon
,
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
you
be
at
the
cotillion
ball
tomorrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
think
we
certainly
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
for
we
shall
all
be
there
.
"
<EOS>
This
civility
was
duly
returned
;
and
they
parted
 
on
Miss
Tilney
's
side
with
some
knowledge
of
her
new
acquaintance
's
feelings
,
and
on
Catherine
's
,
without
the
smallest
consciousness
of
having
explained
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
home
very
happy
.
<EOS>
The
morning
had
answered
all
her
hopes
,
and
the
evening
of
the
following
day
was
now
the
object
of
expectation
,
the
future
good
.
<EOS>
What
gown
and
what
head
-
dress
she
should
wear
on
the
occasion
became
her
chief
concern
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
be
justified
in
it
.
<EOS>
Dress
is
at
all
times
a
frivolous
distinction
,
and
excessive
solicitude
about
it
often
destroys
its
own
aim
.
<EOS>
Catherine
knew
all
this
very
well
;
her
great
aunt
had
read
her
a
lecture
on
the
subject
only
the
Christmas
before
;
and
yet
she
lay
awake
ten
minutes
on
Wednesday
night
debating
between
her
spotted
and
her
tamboured
muslin
,
and
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
shortness
of
the
time
prevented
her
buying
a
new
one
for
the
evening
.
<EOS>
This
would
have
been
an
error
in
judgment
,
great
though
not
uncommon
,
from
which
one
of
the
other
sex
rather
than
her
own
,
a
brother
rather
than
a
great
aunt
,
might
have
warned
her
,
for
man
only
can
be
aware
of
the
insensibility
of
man
towards
a
new
gown
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
mortifying
to
the
feelings
of
many
ladies
,
could
they
be
made
to
understand
how
little
the
heart
of
man
is
affected
by
what
is
costly
or
new
in
their
attire
;
how
little
it
is
biased
by
the
texture
of
their
muslin
,
and
how
unsusceptible
of
peculiar
tenderness
towards
the
spotted
,
the
sprigged
,
the
mull
,
or
the
jackonet
.
<EOS>
Woman
is
fine
for
her
own
satisfaction
alone
.
<EOS>
No
man
will
admire
her
the
more
,
no
woman
will
like
her
the
better
for
it
.
<EOS>
Neatness
and
fashion
are
enough
for
the
former
,
and
a
something
of
shabbiness
or
impropriety
will
be
most
endearing
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
But
not
one
of
these
grave
reflections
troubled
the
tranquillity
of
Catherine
.
  
<EOS>
She
entered
the
rooms
on
Thursday
evening
with
feelings
very
different
from
what
had
attended
her
thither
the
Monday
before
.
<EOS>
She
had
then
been
exulting
in
her
engagement
to
Thorpe
,
and
was
now
chiefly
anxious
to
avoid
his
sight
,
lest
he
should
engage
her
again
;
for
though
she
could
not
,
dared
not
expect
that
Mr.
Tilney
should
ask
her
a
third
time
to
dance
,
her
wishes
,
hopes
,
and
plans
all
centred
in
nothing
less
.
<EOS>
Every
young
lady
may
feel
for
my
heroine
in
this
critical
moment
,
for
every
young
lady
has
at
some
time
or
other
known
the
same
agitation
.
<EOS>
All
have
been
,
or
at
least
all
have
believed
themselves
to
be
,
in
danger
from
the
pursuit
of
someone
whom
they
wished
to
avoid
;
and
all
have
been
anxious
for
the
attentions
of
someone
whom
they
wished
to
please
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
joined
by
the
Thorpes
,
Catherine
's
agony
began
;
she
fidgeted
about
if
John
Thorpe
came
towards
her
,
hid
herself
as
much
as
possible
from
his
view
,
and
when
he
spoke
to
her
pretended
not
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
The
cotillions
were
over
,
the
country
-
dancing
beginning
,
and
she
saw
nothing
of
the
Tilneys
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
be
frightened
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
"
whispered
Isabella
,
"
but
I
am
really
going
to
dance
with
your
brother
again
.
<EOS>
I
declare
positively
it
is
quite
shocking
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
,
but
you
and
John
must
keep
us
in
countenance
.
<EOS>
Make
haste
,
my
dear
creature
,
and
come
to
us
.
<EOS>
John
is
just
walked
off
,
but
he
will
be
back
in
a
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
answer
.
<EOS>
The
others
walked
away
,
John
Thorpe
was
still
in
view
,
and
she
gave
herself
up
for
lost
.
<EOS>
That
she
might
not
appear
,
however
,
to
observe
or
expect
him
,
she
kept
her
eyes
intently
fixed
on
her
fan
;
and
a
self
-
condemnation
for
her
folly
,
in
supposing
that
among
such
a
crowd
they
should
even
meet
with
the
Tilneys
in
any
reasonable
time
,
had
just
passed
through
her
mind
,
when
she
suddenly
found
herself
addressed
and
again
solicited
to
dance
,
by
Mr.
Tilney
himself
.
<EOS>
With
what
sparkling
eyes
and
ready
motion
she
granted
his
request
,
and
with
how
pleasing
a
flutter
of
heart
she
went
with
him
to
the
set
,
may
be
easily
imagined
.
<EOS>
To
escape
,
and
,
as
she
believed
,
so
narrowly
escape
John
Thorpe
,
and
to
be
asked
,
so
immediately
on
his
joining
her
,
asked
by
Mr.
Tilney
,
as
if
he
had
sought
her
on
purpose
!
 
<EOS>
it
did
not
appear
to
her
that
life
could
supply
any
greater
felicity
.
  
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
they
worked
themselves
into
the
quiet
possession
of
a
place
,
however
,
when
her
attention
was
claimed
by
John
Thorpe
,
who
stood
behind
her
.
"
<EOS>
Heyday
,
Miss
Morland
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
and
I
were
to
dance
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
should
think
so
,
for
you
never
asked
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
good
one
,
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
I
asked
you
as
soon
as
I
came
into
the
room
,
and
I
was
just
going
to
ask
you
again
,
<EOS>
but
when
I
turned
round
,
you
were
gone
!
<EOS>
This
is
a
cursed
shabby
trick
!
<EOS>
I
only
came
for
the
sake
of
dancing
with
you
,
and
I
firmly
believe
you
were
engaged
to
me
ever
since
Monday
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
remember
,
I
asked
you
while
you
were
waiting
in
the
lobby
for
your
cloak
.
<EOS>
And
here
have
I
been
telling
all
my
acquaintance
that
I
was
going
to
dance
with
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
;
and
when
they
see
you
standing
up
with
somebody
else
,
they
will
quiz
me
famously
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
they
will
never
think
of
me
,
after
such
a
description
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
heavens
,
if
they
do
not
,
I
will
kick
them
out
of
the
room
for
blockheads
.
<EOS>
What
chap
have
you
there
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
satisfied
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"
Tilney
,
"
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hum
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
him
.
<EOS>
A
good
figure
of
a
man
;
well
put
together
.
<EOS>
Does
he
want
a
horse
?
<EOS>
Here
is
a
friend
of
mine
,
Sam
Fletcher
,
has
got
one
to
sell
that
would
suit
anybody
.
<EOS>
A
famous
clever
animal
for
the
road
 
only
forty
guineas
.
<EOS>
I
had
fifty
minds
to
buy
it
myself
,
for
it
is
one
of
my
maxims
always
to
buy
a
good
horse
when
I
meet
with
one
;
but
it
would
not
answer
my
purpose
,
it
would
not
do
for
the
field
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
any
money
for
a
real
good
hunter
.
<EOS>
I
have
three
now
,
the
best
that
ever
were
backed
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
take
eight
hundred
guineas
for
them
.
<EOS>
Fletcher
and
<EOS>
I
mean
to
get
a
house
in
Leicestershire
,
against
the
next
season
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
d
 
<EOS>
uncomfortable
,
living
at
an
inn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
last
sentence
by
which
he
could
weary
Catherine
's
attention
,
for
he
was
just
then
borne
off
by
the
resistless
pressure
of
a
long
string
of
passing
ladies
.
<EOS>
Her
partner
now
drew
near
,
and
said
,
"
That
gentleman
would
have
put
me
out
of
patience
,
had
he
stayed
with
you
half
a
minute
longer
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
business
to
withdraw
the
attention
of
my
partner
from
me
.
<EOS>
We
have
entered
into
a
contract
of
mutual
agreeableness
for
the
space
of
an
evening
,
and
all
our
agreeableness
belongs
solely
to
each
other
for
that
time
.
<EOS>
Nobody
can
fasten
themselves
on
the
notice
of
one
,
without
injuring
the
rights
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
consider
a
country
-
dance
as
an
emblem
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
Fidelity
and
complaisance
are
the
principal
duties
of
both
;
and
those
men
who
do
not
choose
to
dance
or
marry
themselves
,
have
no
business
with
the
partners
or
wives
of
their
neighbours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
are
such
very
different
things
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
 
That
you
think
they
can
not
be
compared
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
not
.
<EOS>
People
that
marry
can
never
part
,
but
must
go
and
keep
house
together
.
<EOS>
People
that
dance
only
stand
opposite
each
other
in
a
long
room
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
such
is
your
definition
of
matrimony
and
dancing
.
<EOS>
Taken
in
that
light
certainly
,
their
resemblance
is
not
striking
;
but
I
think
I
could
place
them
in
such
a
view
.
<EOS>
You
will
allow
,
that
in
both
,
man
has
the
advantage
of
choice
,
woman
only
the
power
of
refusal
;
that
in
both
,
it
is
an
engagement
between
man
and
woman
,
formed
for
the
advantage
of
each
;
and
that
when
once
entered
into
,
they
belong
exclusively
to
each
other
till
the
moment
of
its
dissolution
;
that
it
is
their
duty
,
each
to
endeavour
to
give
the
other
no
cause
for
wishing
that
he
or
she
had
bestowed
themselves
elsewhere
,
and
their
best
interest
to
keep
their
own
imaginations
from
wandering
towards
the
perfections
of
their
neighbours
,
or
fancying
that
they
should
have
been
better
off
with
anyone
else
.
<EOS>
You
will
allow
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
as
you
state
it
,
all
this
sounds
very
well
;
but
still
they
are
so
very
different
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
look
upon
them
at
all
in
the
same
light
,
nor
think
the
same
duties
belong
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
one
respect
,
there
certainly
is
a
difference
.
<EOS>
In
marriage
,
the
man
is
supposed
to
provide
for
the
support
of
the
woman
,
the
woman
to
make
the
home
agreeable
to
the
man
;
he
is
to
purvey
,
and
she
is
to
smile
.
<EOS>
But
in
dancing
,
their
duties
are
exactly
changed
;
the
agreeableness
,
the
compliance
are
expected
from
him
,
while
she
furnishes
the
fan
and
the
lavender
water
.
<EOS>
That
,
I
suppose
,
was
the
difference
of
duties
which
struck
you
,
as
rendering
the
conditions
incapable
of
comparison
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
I
never
thought
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
quite
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
One
thing
,
however
,
I
must
observe
.
<EOS>
This
disposition
on
your
side
is
rather
alarming
.
<EOS>
You
totally
disallow
any
similarity
in
the
obligations
;
and
may
I
not
thence
infer
that
your
notions
of
the
duties
of
the
dancing
state
are
not
so
strict
as
your
partner
might
wish
?
<EOS>
Have
I
not
reason
to
fear
that
if
the
gentleman
who
spoke
to
you
just
now
were
to
return
,
or
if
any
other
gentleman
were
to
address
you
,
there
would
be
nothing
to
restrain
you
from
conversing
with
him
as
long
as
you
chose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Thorpe
is
such
a
very
particular
friend
of
my
brother
's
,
that
if
he
talks
to
me
,
I
must
talk
to
him
again
;
but
there
are
hardly
three
young
men
in
the
room
besides
him
that
I
have
any
acquaintance
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
that
to
be
my
only
security
?
<EOS>
Alas
,
alas
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
am
sure
you
can
not
have
a
better
;
for
if
I
do
not
know
anybody
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
talk
to
them
;
and
,
besides
,
I
do
not
want
to
talk
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
have
given
me
a
security
worth
having
;
and
I
shall
proceed
with
courage
.
<EOS>
Do
you
find
Bath
as
agreeable
as
when
I
had
the
honour
of
making
the
inquiry
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
quite
 
more
so
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
so
!
<EOS>
Take
care
,
or
you
will
forget
to
be
tired
of
it
at
the
proper
time
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
tired
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
should
be
tired
,
if
I
were
to
stay
here
six
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bath
,
compared
with
London
,
has
little
variety
,
and
so
everybody
finds
out
every
year
.
<EOS>
"
For
six
weeks
,
I
allow
Bath
is
pleasant
enough
;
but
beyond
that
,
it
is
the
most
tiresome
place
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
told
so
by
people
of
all
descriptions
,
who
come
regularly
every
winter
,
lengthen
their
six
weeks
into
ten
or
twelve
,
and
go
away
at
last
because
they
can
afford
to
stay
no
longer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
other
people
must
judge
for
themselves
,
and
those
who
go
to
London
may
think
nothing
of
Bath
.
<EOS>
But
I
,
who
live
in
a
small
retired
village
in
the
country
,
can
never
find
greater
sameness
in
such
a
place
as
this
than
in
my
own
home
;
for
here
are
a
variety
of
amusements
,
a
variety
of
things
to
be
seen
and
done
all
day
long
,
which
I
can
know
nothing
of
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
fond
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
lived
there
,
and
always
been
very
happy
.
<EOS>
But
certainly
there
is
much
more
sameness
in
a
country
life
than
in
a
Bath
life
.
<EOS>
One
day
in
the
country
is
exactly
like
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
then
you
spend
your
time
so
much
more
rationally
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
there
is
much
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
in
pursuit
only
of
amusement
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
I
am
at
home
 
<EOS>
only
I
do
not
find
so
much
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
walk
about
here
,
and
so
I
do
there
;
<EOS>
but
here
I
see
a
variety
of
people
in
every
street
,
and
there
I
can
only
go
and
call
on
Mrs.
Allen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
was
very
much
amused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
go
and
call
on
Mrs.
Allen
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
picture
of
intellectual
poverty
!
<EOS>
However
,
when
you
sink
into
this
abyss
again
,
you
will
have
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
able
to
talk
of
Bath
,
and
of
all
that
you
did
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
in
want
of
something
to
talk
of
again
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
or
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
I
really
believe
I
shall
always
be
talking
of
Bath
,
when
I
am
at
home
again
 
<EOS>
I
do
like
it
so
very
much
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
but
have
Papa
and
Mamma
,
and
the
rest
of
them
here
,
I
suppose
I
should
be
too
happy
!
<EOS>
James
's
coming
(
my
eldest
brother
)
is
quite
delightful
 
and
especially
as
it
turns
out
that
the
very
family
we
are
just
got
so
intimate
with
are
his
intimate
friends
already
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Who
can
ever
be
tired
of
Bath
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
those
who
bring
such
fresh
feelings
of
every
sort
to
it
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
But
papas
and
mammas
,
and
brothers
,
and
intimate
friends
are
a
good
deal
gone
by
,
to
most
of
the
frequenters
of
Bath
 
and
the
honest
relish
of
balls
and
plays
,
and
everyday
sights
,
is
past
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
Here
their
conversation
closed
,
the
demands
of
the
dance
becoming
now
too
importunate
for
a
divided
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
their
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
set
,
Catherine
perceived
herself
to
be
earnestly
regarded
by
a
gentleman
who
stood
among
the
lookers
-
on
,
immediately
behind
her
partner
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
handsome
man
,
of
a
commanding
aspect
,
past
the
bloom
,
but
not
past
the
vigour
of
life
;
and
with
his
eye
still
directed
towards
her
,
she
saw
him
presently
address
Mr.
Tilney
in
a
familiar
whisper
.
<EOS>
Confused
by
his
notice
,
and
blushing
from
the
fear
of
its
being
excited
by
something
wrong
in
her
appearance
,
she
turned
away
her
head
.
<EOS>
But
while
she
did
so
,
the
gentleman
retreated
,
and
her
partner
,
coming
nearer
,
said
,
"
I
see
that
you
guess
what
I
have
just
been
asked
.
<EOS>
That
gentleman
knows
your
name
,
and
you
have
a
right
to
know
his
.
<EOS>
It
is
General
Tilney
,
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
answer
was
only
"
Oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
it
was
an
"
Oh
!
"
expressing
everything
needful
:
attention
to
his
words
,
and
perfect
reliance
on
their
truth
.
<EOS>
With
real
interest
and
strong
admiration
did
her
eye
now
follow
the
general
,
as
he
moved
through
the
crowd
,
and
"
How
handsome
a
family
they
are
!
<EOS>
"
was
her
secret
remark
.
  
<EOS>
In
chatting
with
Miss
Tilney
before
the
evening
concluded
,
a
new
source
of
felicity
arose
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
taken
a
country
walk
since
her
arrival
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
,
to
whom
all
the
commonly
frequented
environs
were
familiar
,
spoke
of
them
in
terms
which
made
her
all
eagerness
to
know
them
too
;
and
on
her
openly
fearing
that
she
might
find
nobody
to
go
with
her
,
it
was
proposed
by
the
brother
and
sister
that
they
should
join
in
a
walk
,
some
morning
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
like
it
,
"
she
cried
,
"
beyond
anything
in
the
world
;
and
do
not
let
us
put
it
off
 
<EOS>
let
us
go
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
readily
agreed
to
,
with
only
a
proviso
of
Miss
Tilney
's
,
that
it
did
not
rain
,
which
Catherine
was
sure
it
would
not
.
<EOS>
At
twelve
o'clock
,
they
were
to
call
for
her
in
Pulteney
Street
;
and
"
Remember
 
twelve
o'clock
,
"
was
her
parting
speech
to
her
new
friend
.
<EOS>
Of
her
other
,
her
older
,
her
more
established
friend
,
Isabella
,
of
whose
fidelity
and
worth
she
had
enjoyed
a
fortnight
's
experience
,
she
scarcely
saw
anything
during
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
though
longing
to
make
her
acquainted
with
her
happiness
,
she
cheerfully
submitted
to
the
wish
of
Mr.
Allen
,
which
took
them
rather
early
away
,
and
her
spirits
danced
within
her
,
as
she
danced
in
her
chair
all
the
way
home
.
    
<EOS>
The
morrow
brought
a
very
sober
-
looking
morning
,
the
sun
making
only
a
few
efforts
to
appear
,
and
Catherine
augured
from
it
everything
most
favourable
to
her
wishes
.
<EOS>
A
bright
morning
so
early
in
the
year
,
she
allowed
,
would
generally
turn
to
rain
,
but
a
cloudy
one
foretold
improvement
as
the
day
advanced
.
<EOS>
She
applied
to
Mr.
Allen
for
confirmation
of
her
hopes
,
but
Mr.
Allen
,
not
having
his
own
skies
and
barometer
about
him
,
declined
giving
any
absolute
promise
of
sunshine
.
<EOS>
She
applied
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
and
Mrs.
Allen
's
opinion
was
more
positive
.
"
<EOS>
She
had
no
doubt
in
the
world
of
its
being
a
very
fine
day
,
if
the
clouds
would
only
go
off
,
and
the
sun
keep
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
about
eleven
o'clock
,
however
,
a
few
specks
of
small
rain
upon
the
windows
caught
Catherine
's
watchful
eye
,
and
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
I
do
believe
it
will
be
wet
,
"
broke
from
her
in
a
most
desponding
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
how
it
would
be
,
"
said
Mrs.
Allen
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
walk
for
me
today
,
"
sighed
Catherine
;
"
but
perhaps
it
may
come
to
nothing
,
or
it
may
hold
up
before
twelve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
may
,
but
then
,
my
dear
,
it
will
be
so
dirty
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
That
will
not
signify
;
I
never
mind
dirt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
her
friend
very
placidly
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
you
never
mind
dirt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
,
"
It
comes
on
faster
and
faster
!
"
<EOS>
said
Catherine
,
as
she
stood
watching
at
a
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
does
indeed
.
<EOS>
If
it
keeps
raining
,
the
streets
will
be
very
wet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
four
umbrellas
up
already
.
<EOS>
How
I
hate
the
sight
of
an
umbrella
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
disagreeable
things
to
carry
.
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
take
a
chair
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
such
a
nice
-
looking
morning
!
<EOS>
I
felt
so
convinced
it
would
be
dry
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Anybody
would
have
thought
so
indeed
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
very
few
people
in
the
pump
-
room
,
if
it
rains
all
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
hope
Mr.
Allen
will
put
on
his
greatcoat
when
he
goes
,
but
I
dare
say
he
will
not
,
for
he
had
rather
do
anything
in
the
world
than
walk
out
in
a
greatcoat
;
I
wonder
he
should
dislike
it
,
it
must
be
so
comfortable
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rain
continued
 
fast
,
though
not
heavy
.
<EOS>
Catherine
went
every
five
minutes
to
the
clock
,
threatening
on
each
return
that
,
if
it
still
kept
on
raining
another
five
minutes
,
she
would
give
up
the
matter
as
hopeless
.
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
twelve
,
and
it
still
rained
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
able
to
go
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
despair
yet
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
give
it
up
till
a
quarter
after
twelve
.
<EOS>
This
is
just
the
time
of
day
for
it
to
clear
up
,
and
I
do
think
it
looks
a
little
lighter
.
<EOS>
There
,
it
is
twenty
minutes
after
twelve
,
and
now
I
shall
give
it
up
entirely
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
That
we
had
such
weather
here
as
they
had
at
Udolpho
,
or
at
least
in
Tuscany
and
the
south
of
France
!
 
<EOS>
the
night
that
poor
St.
Aubin
died
!
 
<EOS>
such
beautiful
weather
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
half
past
twelve
,
when
Catherine
's
anxious
attention
to
the
weather
was
over
and
she
could
no
longer
claim
any
merit
from
its
amendment
,
the
sky
began
voluntarily
to
clear
.
<EOS>
A
gleam
of
sunshine
took
her
quite
by
surprise
;
she
looked
round
;
the
clouds
were
parting
,
and
she
instantly
returned
to
the
window
to
watch
over
and
encourage
the
happy
appearance
.
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
more
made
it
certain
that
a
bright
afternoon
would
succeed
,
and
justified
the
opinion
of
Mrs.
Allen
,
who
had
"
always
thought
it
would
clear
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
whether
Catherine
might
still
expect
her
friends
,
whether
there
had
not
been
too
much
rain
for
Miss
Tilney
to
venture
,
must
yet
be
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
too
dirty
for
Mrs.
Allen
to
accompany
her
husband
to
the
pump
-
room
;
he
accordingly
set
off
by
himself
,
and
Catherine
had
barely
watched
him
down
the
street
when
her
notice
was
claimed
by
the
approach
of
the
same
two
open
carriages
,
containing
the
same
three
people
that
had
surprised
her
so
much
a
few
mornings
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Isabella
,
my
brother
,
and
Mr.
Thorpe
,
I
declare
!
<EOS>
They
are
coming
for
me
perhaps
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
go
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
indeed
,
for
you
know
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
may
still
call
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
agreed
to
it
.
<EOS>
John
Thorpe
was
soon
with
them
,
and
his
voice
was
with
them
yet
sooner
,
for
on
the
stairs
he
was
calling
out
to
Miss
Morland
to
be
quick
.
"
<EOS>
Make
haste
!
<EOS>
Make
haste
!
"
<EOS>
as
he
threw
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Put
on
your
hat
this
moment
 
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
 
we
are
going
to
Bristol
.
<EOS>
How
d'ye
do
,
Mrs.
Allen
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
Bristol
!
<EOS>
Is
not
that
a
great
way
off
?
<EOS>
But
,
however
,
I
can
not
go
with
you
today
,
because
I
am
engaged
;
I
expect
some
friends
every
moment
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
of
course
vehemently
talked
down
as
no
reason
at
all
;
Mrs.
Allen
was
called
on
to
second
him
,
and
the
two
others
walked
in
,
to
give
their
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
sweetest
Catherine
,
is
not
this
delightful
?
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
most
heavenly
drive
.
<EOS>
You
are
to
thank
your
brother
and
me
for
the
scheme
;
it
darted
into
our
heads
at
breakfast
-
time
,
I
verily
believe
at
the
same
instant
;
and
we
should
have
been
off
two
hours
ago
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
detestable
rain
.
<EOS>
But
it
does
not
signify
,
the
nights
are
moonlight
,
and
we
shall
do
delightfully
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
in
such
ecstasies
at
the
thoughts
of
a
little
country
air
and
quiet
!
<EOS>
So
much
better
than
going
to
the
Lower
Rooms
.
<EOS>
We
shall
drive
directly
to
Clifton
and
dine
there
;
and
,
as
soon
as
dinner
is
over
,
if
there
is
time
for
it
,
go
on
to
Kingsweston
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
our
being
able
to
do
so
much
,
"
said
Morland
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
croaking
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thorpe
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
able
to
do
ten
times
more
.
<EOS>
Kingsweston
!
<EOS>
Aye
,
and
Blaize
Castle
too
,
and
anything
else
we
can
hear
of
;
but
here
is
your
sister
says
she
will
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Blaize
Castle
!
"
cried
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
finest
place
in
England
 
worth
going
fifty
miles
at
any
time
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
is
it
really
a
castle
,
an
old
castle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
oldest
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
it
like
what
one
reads
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
 
the
very
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
now
really
 
are
there
towers
and
long
galleries
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
dozens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
should
like
to
see
it
;
but
I
can
not
 
I
can
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
go
!
<EOS>
My
beloved
creature
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
go
,
because
"
 
looking
down
as
she
spoke
,
fearful
of
Isabella
's
smile
 
<EOS>
"
I
expect
Miss
Tilney
and
her
brother
to
call
on
me
to
take
a
country
walk
.
<EOS>
They
promised
to
come
at
twelve
,
only
it
rained
;
but
now
,
as
it
is
so
fine
,
I
dare
say
they
will
be
here
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
they
indeed
,
"
cried
Thorpe
;
"
for
,
as
we
turned
into
Broad
Street
<EOS>
,
I
saw
them
 
<EOS>
does
he
not
drive
a
phaeton
with
bright
chestnuts
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
he
does
;
I
saw
him
.
<EOS>
You
are
talking
of
the
man
you
danced
with
last
night
,
are
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
saw
him
at
that
moment
turn
up
the
Lansdown
Road
,
driving
a
smart
-
looking
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
indeed
?
"
  
"
Did
upon
my
soul
;
knew
him
again
directly
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
got
some
very
pretty
cattle
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
odd
!
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
they
thought
it
would
be
too
dirty
for
a
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
well
they
might
,
for
I
never
saw
so
much
dirt
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Walk
!
<EOS>
You
could
no
more
walk
than
you
could
fly
!
<EOS>
It
has
not
been
so
dirty
the
whole
winter
;
it
is
ankle
-
deep
everywhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
corroborated
it
:
"
My
dearest
Catherine
,
you
can
not
form
an
idea
of
the
dirt
;
come
,
you
must
go
;
you
can
not
refuse
going
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
the
castle
;
but
may
we
go
all
over
it
?
<EOS>
May
we
go
up
every
staircase
,
and
into
every
suite
of
rooms
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
every
hole
and
corner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
then
,
if
they
should
only
be
gone
out
for
an
hour
till
it
is
dryer
,
and
call
by
and
by
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Make
yourself
easy
,
there
is
no
danger
of
that
,
for
I
heard
Tilney
hallooing
to
a
man
who
was
just
passing
by
on
horseback
,
that
they
were
going
as
far
as
Wick
Rocks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
go
,
Mrs.
Allen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
as
you
please
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
Allen
,
you
must
persuade
her
to
go
,
"
was
the
general
cry
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
was
not
inattentive
to
it
:
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
she
,
"
suppose
you
go
.
"
<EOS>
And
in
two
minutes
they
were
off
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
feelings
,
as
she
got
into
the
carriage
,
were
in
a
very
unsettled
state
;
divided
between
regret
for
the
loss
of
one
great
pleasure
,
and
the
hope
of
soon
enjoying
another
,
almost
its
equal
in
degree
,
however
unlike
in
kind
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
think
the
Tilneys
had
acted
quite
well
by
her
,
in
so
readily
giving
up
their
engagement
,
without
sending
her
any
message
of
excuse
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
but
an
hour
later
than
the
time
fixed
on
for
the
beginning
of
their
walk
;
and
,
in
spite
of
what
she
had
heard
of
the
prodigious
accumulation
of
dirt
in
the
course
of
that
hour
,
she
could
not
from
her
own
observation
help
thinking
that
they
might
have
gone
with
very
little
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
To
feel
herself
slighted
by
them
was
very
painful
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
delight
of
exploring
an
edifice
like
Udolpho
,
as
her
fancy
represented
Blaize
Castle
to
be
,
was
such
a
counterpoise
of
good
as
might
console
her
for
almost
anything
.
  
<EOS>
They
passed
briskly
down
Pulteney
Street
,
and
through
Laura
Place
,
without
the
exchange
of
many
words
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
talked
to
his
horse
,
and
she
meditated
,
by
turns
,
on
broken
promises
and
broken
arches
,
phaetons
and
false
hangings
,
Tilneys
and
trap
-
doors
.
<EOS>
As
they
entered
Argyle
Buildings
,
however
,
she
was
roused
by
this
address
from
her
companion
,
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
girl
who
looked
at
you
so
hard
as
she
went
by
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
<EOS>
Where
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
right
-
hand
pavement
 
she
must
be
almost
out
of
sight
now
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
looked
round
and
saw
Miss
Tilney
leaning
on
her
brother
's
arm
,
walking
slowly
down
the
street
.
<EOS>
She
saw
them
both
looking
back
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
stop
,
Mr.
Thorpe
,
"
she
impatiently
cried
;
"
it
is
Miss
Tilney
;
it
is
indeed
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
tell
me
they
were
gone
?
<EOS>
Stop
,
stop
,
I
will
get
out
this
moment
and
go
to
them
.
"
<EOS>
But
to
what
purpose
did
she
speak
?
<EOS>
Thorpe
only
lashed
his
horse
into
a
brisker
trot
;
the
Tilneys
,
who
had
soon
ceased
to
look
after
her
,
were
in
a
moment
out
of
sight
<EOS>
round
the
corner
of
Laura
Place
,
and
in
another
moment
she
was
herself
whisked
into
the
marketplace
.
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
and
during
the
length
of
another
street
,
she
entreated
him
to
stop
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
pray
stop
,
Mr.
Thorpe
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
back
to
Miss
Tilney
.
"
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Thorpe
only
laughed
,
smacked
his
whip
,
encouraged
his
horse
,
made
odd
noises
,
and
drove
on
;
and
Catherine
,
angry
and
vexed
as
she
was
,
having
no
power
of
getting
away
<EOS>
,
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
point
and
submit
.
<EOS>
Her
reproaches
,
however
,
were
not
spared
.
<EOS>
"
How
could
you
deceive
me
so
,
Mr.
Thorpe
?
<EOS>
How
could
you
say
that
you
saw
them
driving
up
the
Lansdown
Road
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
had
it
happen
so
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
They
must
think
it
so
strange
,
so
rude
of
me
!
<EOS>
To
go
by
them
,
too
,
without
saying
a
word
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
how
vexed
I
am
;
I
shall
have
no
pleasure
at
Clifton
,
nor
in
anything
else
.
<EOS>
I
had
rather
,
ten
thousand
times
rather
,
get
out
now
,
and
walk
back
to
them
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
say
you
saw
them
driving
out
in
a
phaeton
?
<EOS>
"
Thorpe
defended
himself
very
stoutly
,
declared
he
had
never
seen
two
men
so
much
alike
in
his
life
,
and
would
hardly
give
up
the
point
of
its
having
been
Tilney
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Their
drive
,
even
when
this
subject
was
over
,
was
not
likely
to
be
very
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
complaisance
was
no
longer
what
it
had
been
in
their
former
airing
.
<EOS>
She
listened
reluctantly
,
and
her
replies
were
short
.
<EOS>
Blaize
Castle
remained
her
only
comfort
;
towards
that
,
she
still
looked
at
intervals
with
pleasure
;
though
rather
than
be
disappointed
of
the
promised
walk
,
and
especially
rather
than
be
thought
ill
of
by
the
Tilneys
,
she
would
willingly
have
given
up
all
the
happiness
which
its
walls
could
supply
 
the
happiness
of
a
progress
through
a
long
suite
of
lofty
rooms
,
exhibiting
the
remains
of
magnificent
furniture
,
though
now
for
many
years
deserted
 
<EOS>
the
happiness
of
being
stopped
in
their
way
along
narrow
,
winding
vaults
,
by
a
low
,
grated
door
;
or
even
of
having
their
lamp
,
their
only
lamp
,
extinguished
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
,
and
of
being
left
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
they
proceeded
on
their
journey
without
any
mischance
,
and
were
within
view
of
the
town
of
Keynsham
,
when
a
halloo
from
Morland
,
who
was
behind
them
,
made
his
friend
pull
up
,
to
know
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
others
then
came
close
enough
for
conversation
,
and
Morland
said
,
"
We
had
better
go
back
,
Thorpe
;
it
is
too
late
to
go
on
today
;
your
sister
thinks
so
as
well
as
I.
We
have
been
exactly
an
hour
coming
from
Pulteney
Street
,
very
little
more
than
seven
miles
;
and
,
I
suppose
,
we
have
at
least
eight
more
to
go
.
<EOS>
It
will
never
do
.
<EOS>
We
set
out
a
great
deal
too
late
.
<EOS>
We
had
much
better
put
it
off
till
another
day
,
and
turn
round
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
one
to
me
,
"
replied
Thorpe
rather
angrily
;
and
instantly
turning
his
horse
,
they
were
on
their
way
back
to
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
your
brother
had
not
got
such
a
d
 
beast
to
drive
,
"
said
he
soon
afterwards
,
"
we
might
have
done
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
My
horse
would
have
trotted
to
Clifton
within
the
hour
,
if
left
to
himself
,
and
I
have
almost
broke
my
arm
with
pulling
him
in
to
that
cursed
broken
-
winded
jade
's
pace
.
<EOS>
Morland
is
a
fool
for
not
keeping
a
horse
and
gig
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
is
not
,
"
said
Catherine
warmly
,
"
for
I
am
sure
he
could
not
afford
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
can
not
he
afford
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
he
has
not
money
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
whose
fault
is
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
's
,
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thorpe
then
said
something
in
the
loud
,
incoherent
way
to
which
he
had
often
recourse
,
about
its
being
a
d
 
thing
to
be
miserly
;
and
that
if
people
who
rolled
in
money
could
not
afford
things
,
he
did
not
know
who
could
,
which
Catherine
did
not
even
endeavour
to
understand
.
<EOS>
Disappointed
of
what
was
to
have
been
the
consolation
for
her
first
disappointment
,
she
was
less
and
less
disposed
either
to
be
agreeable
herself
or
to
find
her
companion
so
;
and
they
returned
to
Pulteney
Street
without
her
speaking
twenty
words
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
entered
the
house
,
the
footman
told
her
that
a
gentleman
and
lady
had
called
and
inquired
for
her
a
few
minutes
after
her
setting
off
;
that
,
when
he
told
them
she
was
gone
out
with
Mr.
Thorpe
,
the
lady
had
asked
whether
any
message
had
been
left
for
her
;
and
on
his
saying
no
,
had
felt
for
a
card
,
but
said
she
had
none
about
her
,
and
went
away
.
<EOS>
Pondering
over
these
heart
-
rending
tidings
,
Catherine
walked
slowly
upstairs
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
them
she
was
met
by
Mr.
Allen
,
who
,
on
hearing
the
reason
of
their
speedy
return
,
said
,
"
I
am
glad
your
brother
had
so
much
sense
;
I
am
glad
you
are
come
back
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
,
wild
scheme
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
spent
the
evening
together
at
Thorpe
's
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
disturbed
and
out
of
spirits
;
but
Isabella
seemed
to
find
a
pool
of
commerce
,
in
the
fate
of
which
she
shared
,
by
private
partnership
with
Morland
,
a
very
good
equivalent
for
the
quiet
and
country
air
of
an
inn
at
Clifton
.
<EOS>
Her
satisfaction
,
too
,
in
not
being
at
the
Lower
Rooms
was
spoken
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
"
How
I
pity
the
poor
creatures
that
are
going
there
!
<EOS>
How
glad
I
am
that
I
am
not
amongst
them
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
it
will
be
a
full
ball
or
not
!
<EOS>
They
have
not
begun
dancing
yet
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
there
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
delightful
to
have
an
evening
now
<EOS>
and
then
to
oneself
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
will
not
be
a
very
good
ball
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
Mitchells
will
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
pity
everybody
that
is
.
<EOS>
But
I
dare
say
,
Mr.
Morland
,
you
long
to
be
at
it
,
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
do
.
<EOS>
Well
,
pray
do
not
let
anybody
here
be
a
restraint
on
you
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
we
could
do
very
well
without
you
;
but
you
men
think
yourselves
of
such
consequence
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
could
almost
have
accused
Isabella
of
being
wanting
in
tenderness
towards
herself
and
her
sorrows
,
so
very
little
<EOS>
did
they
appear
to
dwell
on
her
mind
,
and
so
very
inadequate
was
the
comfort
she
offered
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
be
so
dull
,
my
dearest
creature
,
"
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
quite
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
It
was
amazingly
shocking
,
to
be
sure
;
but
the
Tilneys
were
entirely
to
blame
.
<EOS>
Why
were
not
they
more
punctual
?
<EOS>
It
was
dirty
,
indeed
,
but
what
did
that
signify
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
John
and
I
should
not
have
minded
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
mind
going
through
anything
,
where
a
friend
is
concerned
;
that
is
my
disposition
,
and
John
is
just
the
same
;
he
has
amazing
strong
feelings
.
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
What
a
delightful
hand
you
have
got
!
<EOS>
Kings
,
I
vow
!
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
happy
in
my
life
!
<EOS>
I
would
fifty
times
rather
you
should
have
them
than
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
now
I
may
dismiss
my
heroine
to
the
sleepless
couch
,
which
is
the
true
heroine
's
portion
;
to
a
pillow
strewed
with
thorns
and
wet
with
tears
.
<EOS>
And
lucky
may
she
think
herself
,
if
she
get
another
good
night
's
rest
in
the
course
of
the
next
three
months
.
    
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Allen
,
"
said
Catherine
the
next
morning
,
"
will
there
be
any
harm
in
my
calling
on
Miss
Tilney
today
?
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
easy
till
I
have
explained
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
,
by
all
means
,
my
dear
;
only
put
on
a
white
gown
;
Miss
Tilney
always
wears
white
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
cheerfully
complied
,
and
being
properly
equipped
,
was
more
impatient
than
ever
to
be
at
the
pump
-
room
,
that
she
might
inform
herself
of
General
Tilney
's
lodgings
,
for
though
she
believed
they
were
in
Milsom
Street
,
she
was
not
certain
of
the
house
,
and
Mrs.
Allen
's
wavering
convictions
only
made
it
more
doubtful
.
<EOS>
To
Milsom
Street
she
was
directed
,
and
having
made
herself
perfect
in
the
number
,
hastened
away
with
eager
steps
and
a
beating
heart
to
pay
her
visit
,
explain
her
conduct
,
and
be
forgiven
;
tripping
lightly
through
the
church
-
yard
,
and
resolutely
turning
away
her
eyes
,
that
she
might
not
be
obliged
to
see
her
beloved
Isabella
and
her
dear
family
<EOS>
,
who
,
she
had
reason
to
believe
,
were
in
a
shop
hard
by
.
<EOS>
She
reached
the
house
without
any
impediment
,
looked
at
the
number
,
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
inquired
for
Miss
Tilney
.
<EOS>
The
man
believed
Miss
Tilney
to
be
at
home
,
but
was
not
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
Would
she
be
pleased
to
send
up
her
name
?
<EOS>
She
gave
her
card
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
servant
returned
,
and
with
a
look
which
did
not
quite
confirm
his
words
,
said
he
had
been
mistaken
,
for
that
Miss
Tilney
was
walked
out
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
with
a
blush
of
mortification
,
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
felt
almost
persuaded
that
Miss
Tilney
was
at
home
,
and
too
much
offended
to
admit
her
;
and
as
she
retired
down
the
street
,
could
not
withhold
one
glance
at
the
drawing
-
room
windows
,
in
expectation
of
seeing
her
there
,
but
no
one
appeared
at
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
bottom
of
the
street
,
however
,
she
looked
back
again
,
and
then
,
not
at
a
window
,
but
issuing
from
the
door
,
she
saw
Miss
Tilney
herself
.
<EOS>
She
was
followed
by
a
gentleman
,
whom
Catherine
believed
to
be
her
father
,
and
they
turned
up
towards
Edgar
's
Buildings
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
in
deep
mortification
,
proceeded
on
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
could
almost
be
angry
herself
at
such
angry
incivility
;
but
she
checked
the
resentful
sensation
;
she
remembered
her
own
ignorance
.
<EOS>
She
knew
not
how
such
an
offence
as
hers
might
be
classed
by
the
laws
of
worldly
politeness
,
to
what
a
degree
of
unforgivingness
it
might
with
propriety
lead
,
nor
to
what
rigours
of
rudeness
in
return
it
might
justly
make
her
amenable
.
  
<EOS>
Dejected
and
humbled
<EOS>
,
she
had
even
some
thoughts
of
not
going
with
the
others
to
the
theatre
that
night
;
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
were
not
of
long
continuance
,
for
she
soon
recollected
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
she
was
without
any
excuse
for
staying
at
home
;
and
,
in
the
second
,
that
it
was
a
play
she
wanted
very
much
to
see
.
<EOS>
To
the
theatre
accordingly
they
all
went
;
no
Tilneys
appeared
to
plague
or
please
her
;
she
feared
that
,
amongst
the
many
perfections
of
the
family
,
a
fondness
for
plays
was
not
to
be
ranked
;
but
perhaps
it
was
because
they
were
habituated
to
the
finer
performances
of
the
London
stage
,
which
she
knew
,
on
Isabella
's
authority
,
rendered
everything
else
of
the
kind
"
quite
horrid
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
not
deceived
in
her
own
expectation
of
pleasure
;
the
comedy
so
well
suspended
her
care
that
no
one
,
observing
her
during
the
first
four
acts
,
would
have
supposed
she
had
any
wretchedness
about
her
.
<EOS>
On
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
,
however
,
the
sudden
view
of
Mr.
Henry
Tilney
and
his
father
,
joining
a
party
in
the
opposite
box
,
recalled
her
to
anxiety
and
distress
.
<EOS>
The
stage
could
no
longer
excite
genuine
merriment
 
no
longer
keep
her
whole
attention
.
<EOS>
Every
other
look
upon
an
average
was
directed
towards
the
opposite
box
;
and
,
for
the
space
of
two
entire
scenes
,
did
she
thus
watch
Henry
Tilney
,
without
being
once
able
to
catch
his
eye
.
<EOS>
No
longer
could
he
be
suspected
of
indifference
for
a
play
;
his
notice
was
never
withdrawn
from
the
stage
during
two
whole
scenes
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
did
look
towards
her
,
and
he
bowed
 
but
such
a
bow
!
<EOS>
No
smile
,
no
continued
observance
attended
it
;
his
eyes
were
immediately
returned
to
their
former
direction
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
restlessly
miserable
;
she
could
almost
have
run
round
to
the
box
in
which
he
sat
and
forced
him
to
hear
her
explanation
.
<EOS>
Feelings
rather
natural
than
heroic
possessed
her
;
instead
of
considering
her
own
dignity
injured
by
this
ready
condemnation
 
instead
of
proudly
resolving
,
in
conscious
innocence
,
to
show
her
resentment
towards
him
who
could
harbour
a
doubt
of
it
,
to
leave
to
him
all
the
trouble
of
seeking
an
explanation
,
and
to
enlighten
him
on
the
past
only
by
avoiding
his
sight
,
or
flirting
with
somebody
else
 
she
took
to
herself
all
the
shame
of
misconduct
,
or
at
least
of
its
appearance
,
and
was
only
eager
for
an
opportunity
of
explaining
its
cause
.
  
<EOS>
The
play
concluded
 
the
curtain
fell
 
<EOS>
Henry
Tilney
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
where
he
had
hitherto
sat
,
but
his
father
remained
,
and
perhaps
he
might
be
now
coming
round
to
their
box
.
<EOS>
She
was
right
;
in
a
few
minutes
he
appeared
,
and
,
making
his
way
through
the
then
thinning
rows
,
spoke
with
like
calm
politeness
to
Mrs.
Allen
and
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Not
with
such
calmness
was
he
answered
by
the
latter
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
,
I
have
been
quite
wild
to
speak
to
you
,
and
make
my
apologies
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
thought
me
so
rude
;
but
indeed
it
was
not
my
own
fault
,
was
it
,
Mrs.
Allen
?
<EOS>
Did
not
they
tell
me
that
Mr.
Tilney
and
his
sister
were
gone
out
in
a
phaeton
together
?
<EOS>
And
then
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
But
I
had
ten
thousand
times
rather
have
been
with
you
;
now
had
not
I
,
Mrs.
Allen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
tumble
my
gown
,
"
was
Mrs.
Allen
's
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Her
assurance
,
however
,
standing
sole
as
it
did
,
was
not
thrown
away
;
it
brought
a
more
cordial
,
more
natural
smile
into
his
countenance
,
and
he
replied
in
a
tone
which
retained
only
a
little
affected
reserve
:
"
We
were
much
obliged
to
you
at
any
rate
for
wishing
us
a
pleasant
walk
after
our
passing
you
in
Argyle
Street
:
you
were
so
kind
as
to
look
back
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
indeed
I
did
not
wish
you
a
pleasant
walk
;
I
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
;
but
I
begged
Mr.
Thorpe
so
earnestly
to
stop
;
I
called
out
to
him
as
soon
as
ever
I
saw
you
;
now
,
Mrs.
Allen
,
did
not
 
Oh
!
<EOS>
You
were
not
there
;
but
indeed
I
did
;
and
,
if
Mr.
Thorpe
would
only
have
stopped
,
I
would
have
jumped
out
and
run
after
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Is
there
a
Henry
in
the
world
who
could
be
insensible
to
such
a
declaration
?
<EOS>
Henry
Tilney
at
least
was
not
.
<EOS>
With
a
yet
sweeter
smile
,
he
said
everything
that
need
be
said
of
his
sister
's
concern
,
regret
,
and
dependence
on
Catherine
's
honour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Do
not
say
Miss
Tilney
was
not
angry
,
"
cried
Catherine
,
"
because
I
know
she
was
;
for
she
would
not
see
me
this
morning
when
I
called
;
I
saw
her
walk
out
of
the
house
the
next
minute
after
my
leaving
it
;
I
was
hurt
,
but
I
was
not
affronted
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
did
not
know
I
had
been
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
within
at
the
time
;
but
I
heard
of
it
from
Eleanor
,
and
she
has
been
wishing
ever
since
to
see
you
,
to
explain
the
reason
of
such
incivility
;
but
perhaps
I
can
do
it
as
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
more
than
that
my
father
 
<EOS>
they
were
just
preparing
to
walk
out
,
and
he
being
hurried
for
time
,
and
not
caring
to
have
it
put
off
 
made
a
point
of
her
being
denied
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
,
I
do
assure
you
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
much
vexed
,
and
meant
to
make
her
apology
as
soon
as
possible
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
mind
was
greatly
eased
by
this
information
,
yet
a
something
of
solicitude
remained
,
from
which
sprang
the
following
question
,
thoroughly
artless
in
itself
,
though
rather
distressing
to
the
gentleman
:
"
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
Tilney
,
why
were
you
less
generous
than
your
sister
?
<EOS>
If
she
felt
such
confidence
in
my
good
intentions
,
and
could
suppose
it
to
be
only
a
mistake
,
why
should
you
be
so
ready
to
take
offence
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Me
!
<EOS>
I
take
offence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
am
sure
by
your
look
,
when
you
came
into
the
box
,
you
were
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
angry
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
no
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
nobody
would
have
thought
you
had
no
right
who
saw
your
face
.
"
<EOS>
He
replied
by
asking
her
to
make
room
for
him
,
and
talking
of
the
play
.
  
<EOS>
He
remained
with
them
some
time
,
and
was
only
too
agreeable
for
Catherine
to
be
contented
when
he
went
away
.
<EOS>
Before
they
parted
,
however
,
it
was
agreed
that
the
projected
walk
should
be
taken
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
,
setting
aside
the
misery
of
his
quitting
their
box
,
she
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
left
one
of
the
happiest
creatures
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
While
talking
to
each
other
,
she
had
observed
with
some
surprise
that
John
Thorpe
,
who
was
never
in
the
same
part
of
the
house
for
ten
minutes
together
,
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
General
Tilney
;
and
she
felt
something
more
than
surprise
when
she
thought
she
could
perceive
herself
the
object
of
their
attention
and
discourse
.
<EOS>
What
could
they
have
to
say
of
her
?
<EOS>
She
feared
General
Tilney
did
not
like
her
appearance
:
she
found
it
was
implied
in
his
preventing
her
admittance
to
his
daughter
,
rather
than
postpone
his
own
walk
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
How
came
Mr.
Thorpe
to
know
your
father
?
"
was
her
anxious
inquiry
,
as
she
pointed
them
out
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
He
knew
nothing
about
it
;
but
his
father
,
like
every
military
man
,
had
a
very
large
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
entertainment
was
over
,
Thorpe
came
to
assist
them
in
getting
out
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
the
immediate
object
of
his
gallantry
;
and
,
while
they
waited
in
the
lobby
for
a
chair
,
he
prevented
the
inquiry
which
had
travelled
from
her
heart
almost
to
the
tip
of
her
tongue
,
by
asking
,
in
a
consequential
manner
,
whether
she
had
seen
him
talking
with
General
Tilney
:
"
He
is
a
fine
old
fellow
,
upon
my
soul
!
<EOS>
Stout
,
active
 
looks
as
young
as
his
son
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him
,
I
assure
you
:
a
gentleman
-
like
,
good
sort
of
fellow
as
ever
lived
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
came
you
to
know
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Know
him
!
<EOS>
There
are
few
people
much
about
town
that
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
met
him
forever
at
the
Bedford
;
and
I
knew
his
face
again
today
the
moment
he
came
into
the
billiard
-
room
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
best
players
we
have
,
by
the
by
;
and
we
had
a
little
touch
together
,
though
I
was
almost
afraid
of
him
at
first
:
<EOS>
the
odds
were
five
to
four
against
me
;
and
,
if
I
had
not
made
one
of
the
cleanest
strokes
that
perhaps
ever
was
made
in
this
world
 
<EOS>
I
took
his
ball
exactly
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
make
you
understand
it
without
a
table
;
however
,
I
did
beat
him
.
<EOS>
A
very
fine
fellow
;
as
rich
as
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
dine
with
him
;
I
dare
say
he
gives
famous
dinners
.
<EOS>
But
what
do
you
think
we
have
been
talking
of
?
<EOS>
You
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
by
heavens
!
<EOS>
And
the
general
thinks
you
the
finest
girl
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
How
can
you
say
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
think
I
said
?
<EOS>
"
 
lowering
his
voice
 
"
well
done
,
general
,
said
I
;
I
am
quite
of
your
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Catherine
,
who
was
much
less
gratified
by
his
admiration
than
by
General
Tilney
's
,
was
not
sorry
to
be
called
away
by
Mr.
Allen
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
,
however
,
would
see
her
to
her
chair
,
and
,
till
she
entered
it
,
continued
the
same
kind
of
delicate
flattery
,
in
spite
of
her
entreating
him
to
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
That
General
Tilney
,
instead
of
disliking
,
should
admire
her
,
was
very
delightful
;
and
she
joyfully
thought
that
there
was
not
one
of
the
family
whom
she
need
now
fear
to
meet
.
<EOS>
The
evening
had
done
more
,
much
more
,
for
her
than
could
have
been
expected
.
    
<EOS>
Monday
,
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
Thursday
,
Friday
,
and
Saturday
have
now
passed
in
review
before
the
reader
;
the
events
of
each
day
,
its
hopes
and
fears
,
mortifications
and
pleasures
,
have
been
separately
stated
,
and
the
pangs
of
Sunday
only
now
remain
to
be
described
,
and
close
the
week
.
<EOS>
The
Clifton
scheme
had
been
deferred
,
not
relinquished
,
and
on
the
afternoon
's
Crescent
of
this
day
,
it
was
brought
forward
again
.
<EOS>
In
a
private
consultation
between
Isabella
and
James
,
the
former
of
whom
had
particularly
set
her
heart
upon
going
,
and
the
latter
no
less
anxiously
placed
his
upon
pleasing
her
,
it
was
agreed
that
,
provided
the
weather
were
fair
,
the
party
should
take
place
on
the
following
morning
;
and
they
were
to
set
off
very
early
,
in
order
to
be
at
home
in
good
time
.
<EOS>
The
affair
thus
determined
,
and
Thorpe
's
approbation
secured
,
Catherine
only
remained
to
be
apprised
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
left
them
for
a
few
minutes
to
speak
to
Miss
Tilney
.
<EOS>
In
that
interval
the
plan
was
completed
,
and
as
soon
as
she
came
again
,
her
agreement
was
demanded
;
but
instead
of
the
gay
acquiescence
expected
by
Isabella
,
Catherine
looked
grave
,
was
very
sorry
,
but
could
not
go
.
<EOS>
The
engagement
which
ought
to
have
kept
her
from
joining
in
the
former
attempt
would
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
accompany
them
now
.
<EOS>
She
had
that
moment
settled
with
Miss
Tilney
to
take
their
proposed
walk
tomorrow
;
it
was
quite
determined
,
and
she
would
not
,
upon
any
account
,
retract
.
<EOS>
But
that
she
must
and
should
retract
was
instantly
the
eager
cry
of
both
the
Thorpes
;
they
must
go
to
Clifton
tomorrow
,
they
would
not
go
without
her
,
it
would
be
nothing
to
put
off
a
mere
walk
for
one
day
longer
,
and
they
would
not
hear
of
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
distressed
,
but
not
subdued
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
urge
me
,
Isabella
.
<EOS>
I
am
engaged
to
Miss
Tilney
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
availed
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
same
arguments
assailed
her
again
;
she
must
go
,
she
should
go
,
and
they
would
not
hear
of
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
easy
to
tell
Miss
Tilney
that
you
had
just
been
reminded
of
a
prior
engagement
,
and
must
only
beg
to
put
off
the
walk
till
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
it
would
not
be
easy
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
no
prior
engagement
.
"
<EOS>
But
Isabella
became
only
more
and
more
urgent
,
calling
on
her
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
,
addressing
her
by
the
most
endearing
names
.
<EOS>
She
was
sure
her
dearest
,
sweetest
Catherine
would
not
seriously
refuse
such
a
trifling
request
to
a
friend
who
loved
her
so
dearly
.
<EOS>
She
knew
her
beloved
Catherine
to
have
so
feeling
a
heart
,
so
sweet
a
temper
,
to
be
so
easily
persuaded
by
those
she
loved
.
<EOS>
But
all
in
vain
;
Catherine
felt
herself
to
be
in
the
right
,
and
though
pained
by
such
tender
,
such
flattering
supplication
,
could
not
allow
it
to
influence
her
.
<EOS>
Isabella
then
tried
another
method
.
<EOS>
She
reproached
her
with
having
more
affection
for
Miss
Tilney
,
though
she
had
known
her
so
little
a
while
,
than
for
her
best
and
oldest
friends
,
with
being
grown
cold
and
indifferent
,
in
short
,
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
being
jealous
,
Catherine
,
when
I
see
myself
slighted
for
strangers
,
I
,
who
love
you
so
excessively
!
<EOS>
When
once
my
affections
are
placed
,
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
anything
to
change
them
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
my
feelings
are
stronger
than
anybody
's
;
I
am
sure
they
are
too
strong
for
my
own
peace
;
and
to
see
myself
supplanted
in
your
friendship
by
strangers
does
cut
me
to
the
quick
,
I
own
.
<EOS>
These
Tilneys
seem
to
swallow
up
everything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
thought
this
reproach
equally
strange
and
unkind
.
<EOS>
Was
it
the
part
of
a
friend
thus
to
expose
her
feelings
to
the
notice
of
others
?
<EOS>
Isabella
appeared
to
her
ungenerous
and
selfish
,
regardless
of
everything
but
her
own
gratification
.
<EOS>
These
painful
ideas
crossed
her
mind
,
though
she
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
Isabella
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
had
applied
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
;
and
Morland
,
miserable
at
such
a
sight
,
could
not
help
saying
,
"
Nay
,
Catherine
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
can
not
stand
out
any
longer
now
.
<EOS>
The
sacrifice
is
not
much
;
and
to
oblige
such
a
friend
 
<EOS>
I
shall
think
you
quite
unkind
,
if
you
still
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
time
of
her
brother
's
openly
siding
against
her
,
and
anxious
to
avoid
his
displeasure
,
she
proposed
a
compromise
.
<EOS>
If
they
would
only
put
off
their
scheme
till
Tuesday
,
which
they
might
easily
do
,
as
it
depended
only
on
themselves
,
she
could
go
with
them
,
and
everybody
might
then
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
But
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
immediate
answer
;
"
that
could
not
be
,
for
Thorpe
did
not
know
that
he
might
not
go
to
town
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
Catherine
was
sorry
,
but
could
do
no
more
;
and
a
short
silence
ensued
,
which
was
broken
by
Isabella
,
who
in
a
voice
of
cold
resentment
said
,
"
Very
well
,
then
there
is
an
end
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
If
Catherine
does
not
go
,
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
the
only
woman
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
upon
any
account
in
the
world
,
do
so
improper
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
,
you
must
go
,
"
said
James
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
can
not
Mr.
Thorpe
drive
one
of
his
other
sisters
?
<EOS>
I
dare
say
either
of
them
would
like
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
ye
,
"
cried
Thorpe
,
"
but
I
did
not
come
to
Bath
to
drive
my
sisters
about
,
and
look
like
a
fool
.
<EOS>
No
,
if
you
do
not
go
,
d---
me
if
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
only
go
for
the
sake
of
driving
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
compliment
which
gives
me
no
pleasure
.
"
<EOS>
But
her
words
were
lost
on
Thorpe
,
who
had
turned
abruptly
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
three
others
still
continued
together
,
walking
in
a
most
uncomfortable
manner
to
poor
Catherine
;
sometimes
not
a
word
was
said
,
sometimes
she
was
again
attacked
with
supplications
or
reproaches
,
and
her
arm
was
still
linked
within
Isabella
's
,
though
their
hearts
were
at
war
.
<EOS>
At
one
moment
she
was
softened
,
at
another
irritated
;
always
distressed
,
but
always
steady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
think
you
had
been
so
obstinate
,
Catherine
,
"
said
James
;
"
you
were
not
used
to
be
so
hard
to
persuade
;
you
once
were
the
kindest
,
best
-
tempered
of
my
sisters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
am
not
less
so
now
,
"
she
replied
,
very
feelingly
;
"
<EOS>
but
indeed
I
can
not
go
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
wrong
,
I
am
doing
what
I
believe
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
"
said
Isabella
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
there
is
no
great
struggle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
heart
swelled
;
she
drew
away
her
arm
,
and
Isabella
made
no
opposition
.
<EOS>
Thus
passed
a
long
ten
minutes
,
till
they
were
again
joined
by
Thorpe
,
who
,
coming
to
them
with
a
gayer
look
,
said
,
"
Well
,
I
have
settled
the
matter
,
and
now
we
may
all
go
tomorrow
with
a
safe
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
to
Miss
Tilney
,
and
made
your
excuses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catherine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
upon
my
soul
.
<EOS>
Left
her
this
moment
.
<EOS>
Told
her
you
had
sent
me
to
say
that
,
having
just
recollected
a
prior
engagement
of
going
to
Clifton
with
us
tomorrow
,
you
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
walking
with
her
till
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
She
said
very
well
,
Tuesday
was
just
as
convenient
to
her
;
so
there
is
an
end
of
all
our
difficulties
.
<EOS>
A
pretty
good
thought
of
mine
 
hey
?
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
's
countenance
was
once
more
all
smiles
and
good
humour
,
and
James
too
looked
happy
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
most
heavenly
thought
indeed
!
<EOS>
Now
,
my
sweet
Catherine
,
all
our
distresses
are
over
;
you
are
honourably
acquitted
,
and
we
shall
have
a
most
delightful
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
will
not
do
,
"
said
Catherine
;
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
submit
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
must
run
after
Miss
Tilney
directly
and
set
her
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
,
however
,
caught
hold
of
one
hand
,
Thorpe
of
the
other
,
and
remonstrances
poured
in
from
all
three
.
<EOS>
Even
James
was
quite
angry
.
<EOS>
When
everything
was
settled
,
when
Miss
Tilney
herself
said
that
Tuesday
would
suit
her
as
well
,
it
was
quite
ridiculous
,
quite
absurd
,
to
make
any
further
objection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorpe
had
no
business
to
invent
any
such
message
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
thought
it
right
to
put
it
off
,
I
could
have
spoken
to
Miss
Tilney
myself
.
<EOS>
This
is
only
doing
it
in
a
ruder
way
;
and
how
do
I
know
that
Mr.
Thorpe
has
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
mistaken
again
perhaps
;
he
led
me
into
one
act
of
rudeness
by
his
mistake
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
Mr.
Thorpe
;
Isabella
,
do
not
hold
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thorpe
told
her
it
would
be
in
vain
to
go
after
the
Tilneys
;
they
were
turning
the
corner
into
Brock
Street
,
when
he
had
overtaken
them
,
and
were
at
home
by
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
go
after
them
,
"
said
Catherine
;
"
wherever
they
are
I
will
go
after
them
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
signify
talking
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
not
be
persuaded
into
doing
what
I
thought
wrong
,
I
never
will
be
tricked
into
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
these
words
she
broke
away
and
hurried
off
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
would
have
darted
after
her
,
but
Morland
withheld
him
.
<EOS>
"
Let
her
go
,
let
her
go
,
if
she
will
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
as
obstinate
as
 
"
  
<EOS>
Thorpe
never
finished
the
simile
,
for
it
could
hardly
have
been
a
proper
one
.
  
<EOS>
Away
walked
Catherine
in
great
agitation
,
as
fast
as
the
crowd
would
permit
her
,
fearful
of
being
pursued
,
yet
determined
to
persevere
.
<EOS>
As
she
walked
,
she
reflected
on
what
had
passed
.
<EOS>
It
was
painful
to
her
to
disappoint
and
displease
them
,
particularly
to
displease
her
brother
;
but
she
could
not
repent
her
resistance
.
<EOS>
Setting
her
own
inclination
apart
,
to
have
failed
a
second
time
in
her
engagement
to
Miss
Tilney
,
to
have
retracted
a
promise
voluntarily
made
only
five
minutes
before
,
and
on
a
false
pretence
too
,
must
have
been
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
withstanding
them
on
selfish
principles
alone
,
she
had
not
consulted
merely
her
own
gratification
;
that
might
have
been
ensured
in
some
degree
by
the
excursion
itself
,
by
seeing
Blaize
Castle
;
no
,
she
had
attended
to
what
was
due
to
others
,
and
to
her
own
character
in
their
opinion
.
<EOS>
Her
conviction
of
being
right
,
however
,
was
not
enough
to
restore
her
composure
;
till
she
had
spoken
to
Miss
Tilney
she
could
not
be
at
ease
;
and
quickening
her
pace
when
she
got
clear
of
the
Crescent
,
she
almost
ran
over
the
remaining
ground
till
she
gained
the
top
of
Milsom
Street
.
<EOS>
So
rapid
had
been
her
movements
that
in
spite
of
the
Tilneys
'
advantage
in
the
outset
,
they
were
but
just
turning
into
their
lodgings
as
she
came
within
view
of
them
;
and
the
servant
still
remaining
at
the
open
door
,
she
used
only
the
ceremony
of
saying
that
she
must
speak
with
Miss
Tilney
that
moment
,
and
hurrying
by
him
proceeded
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Then
,
opening
the
first
door
before
her
,
which
happened
to
be
the
right
,
she
immediately
found
herself
in
the
drawing
-
room
with
General
Tilney
,
his
son
,
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
Her
explanation
,
defective
only
in
being
 
from
her
irritation
of
nerves
and
shortness
of
breath
 
<EOS>
no
explanation
at
all
,
was
instantly
given
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
in
a
great
hurry
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
a
mistake
 
<EOS>
I
never
promised
to
go
 
<EOS>
I
told
them
from
the
first
I
could
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
ran
away
in
a
great
hurry
to
explain
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
care
what
you
thought
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
stay
for
the
servant
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
business
,
however
,
though
not
perfectly
elucidated
by
this
speech
,
soon
ceased
to
be
a
puzzle
.
<EOS>
Catherine
found
that
John
Thorpe
had
given
the
message
;
and
Miss
Tilney
had
no
scruple
in
owning
herself
greatly
surprised
by
it
.
<EOS>
But
whether
her
brother
had
still
exceeded
her
in
resentment
,
Catherine
,
though
she
instinctively
addressed
herself
as
much
to
one
as
to
the
other
in
her
vindication
,
had
no
means
of
knowing
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
have
been
felt
before
her
arrival
,
her
eager
declarations
immediately
made
every
look
and
sentence
as
friendly
as
she
could
desire
.
  
<EOS>
The
affair
thus
happily
settled
,
she
was
introduced
by
Miss
Tilney
to
her
father
,
and
received
by
him
with
such
ready
,
such
solicitous
politeness
as
recalled
Thorpe
's
information
to
her
mind
,
and
made
her
think
with
pleasure
that
he
might
be
sometimes
depended
on
.
<EOS>
To
such
anxious
attention
was
the
general
's
civility
carried
,
that
not
aware
of
her
extraordinary
swiftness
in
entering
the
house
,
he
was
quite
angry
with
the
servant
whose
neglect
had
reduced
her
to
open
the
door
of
the
apartment
herself
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
William
mean
by
it
?
<EOS>
He
should
make
a
point
of
inquiring
into
the
matter
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
Catherine
had
not
most
warmly
asserted
his
innocence
,
it
seemed
likely
that
William
would
lose
the
favour
of
his
master
forever
,
if
not
his
place
,
by
her
rapidity
.
  
<EOS>
After
sitting
with
them
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
she
rose
to
take
leave
,
and
was
then
most
agreeably
surprised
by
General
Tilney
's
asking
her
if
she
would
do
his
daughter
the
honour
of
dining
and
spending
the
rest
of
the
day
with
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
added
her
own
wishes
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
greatly
obliged
;
but
it
was
quite
out
of
her
power
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
would
expect
her
back
every
moment
.
<EOS>
The
general
declared
he
could
say
no
more
;
the
claims
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
were
not
to
be
superseded
;
but
on
some
other
day
he
trusted
,
when
longer
notice
could
be
given
,
they
would
not
refuse
to
spare
her
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
<EOS>
;
Catherine
was
sure
they
would
not
have
the
least
objection
,
and
she
should
have
great
pleasure
in
coming
.
<EOS>
"
The
general
attended
her
himself
to
the
street
-
door
,
saying
everything
gallant
as
they
went
downstairs
,
admiring
the
elasticity
of
her
walk
,
which
corresponded
exactly
with
the
spirit
of
her
dancing
,
and
making
her
one
of
the
most
graceful
bows
she
had
ever
beheld
,
when
they
parted
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
delighted
by
all
that
had
passed
,
proceeded
gaily
to
Pulteney
Street
,
walking
,
as
she
concluded
,
with
great
elasticity
,
though
she
had
never
thought
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
She
reached
home
without
seeing
anything
more
of
the
offended
party
;
and
now
that
she
had
been
triumphant
throughout
,
had
carried
her
point
,
and
was
secure
of
her
walk
<EOS>
,
she
began
(
as
the
flutter
of
her
spirits
subsided
)
to
doubt
whether
she
had
been
perfectly
right
.
<EOS>
A
sacrifice
was
always
noble
;
and
if
she
had
given
way
to
their
entreaties
,
she
should
have
been
spared
the
distressing
idea
of
a
friend
displeased
,
a
brother
angry
,
and
a
scheme
of
great
happiness
to
both
destroyed
,
perhaps
through
her
means
.
<EOS>
To
ease
her
mind
,
and
ascertain
by
the
opinion
of
an
unprejudiced
person
what
her
own
conduct
had
really
been
,
she
took
occasion
to
mention
before
Mr.
Allen
the
half
-
settled
scheme
of
her
brother
and
the
Thorpes
for
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
caught
at
it
directly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
do
you
think
of
going
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
had
just
engaged
myself
to
walk
with
Miss
Tilney
before
they
told
me
of
it
;
and
therefore
you
know
I
could
not
go
with
them
,
could
I
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
certainly
not
;
and
I
am
glad
you
do
not
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
These
schemes
are
not
at
all
the
thing
.
<EOS>
Young
men
and
women
driving
about
the
country
in
open
carriages
!
<EOS>
Now
and
then
it
is
very
well
;
but
going
to
inns
and
public
places
together
!
<EOS>
It
is
not
right
;
and
I
wonder
Mrs.
Thorpe
should
allow
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
do
not
think
of
going
;
I
am
sure
Mrs.
Morland
would
not
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
,
are
not
you
of
my
way
of
thinking
?
<EOS>
Do
not
you
think
these
kind
of
projects
objectionable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
much
so
indeed
.
<EOS>
Open
carriages
are
nasty
things
.
<EOS>
A
clean
gown
is
not
five
minutes
'
wear
in
them
.
<EOS>
You
are
splashed
getting
in
and
getting
out
;
and
the
wind
takes
your
hair
and
your
bonnet
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
I
hate
an
open
carriage
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
;
but
that
is
not
the
question
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
think
it
has
an
odd
appearance
,
if
young
ladies
are
frequently
driven
about
in
them
by
young
men
,
to
whom
they
are
not
even
related
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
a
very
odd
appearance
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
madam
,
"
cried
Catherine
,
"
then
why
did
not
you
tell
me
so
before
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
if
I
had
known
it
to
be
improper
,
I
would
not
have
gone
with
Mr.
Thorpe
at
all
;
but
I
always
hoped
you
would
tell
me
,
if
you
thought
I
was
doing
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
I
should
,
my
dear
,
you
may
depend
on
it
;
for
as
I
told
Mrs.
Morland
at
parting
,
I
would
always
do
the
best
for
you
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
But
one
must
not
be
over
particular
.
<EOS>
Young
people
will
be
young
people
,
as
your
good
mother
says
herself
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
wanted
you
,
when
we
first
came
,
not
to
buy
that
sprigged
muslin
,
but
you
would
.
<EOS>
Young
people
do
not
like
to
be
always
thwarted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
this
was
something
of
real
consequence
;
and
I
do
not
think
you
would
have
found
me
hard
to
persuade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
it
has
gone
hitherto
,
there
is
no
harm
done
,
"
said
Mr.
Allen
;
"
and
I
would
only
advise
you
,
my
dear
,
not
to
go
out
with
Mr.
Thorpe
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
what
I
was
going
to
say
,
"
added
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
relieved
for
herself
,
felt
uneasy
for
Isabella
,
and
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
asked
Mr.
Allen
whether
it
would
not
be
both
proper
and
kind
in
her
to
write
to
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
explain
the
indecorum
of
which
she
must
be
as
insensible
as
herself
;
for
she
considered
that
Isabella
might
otherwise
perhaps
be
going
to
Clifton
the
next
day
,
in
spite
of
what
had
passed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
,
however
,
discouraged
her
from
doing
any
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
leave
her
alone
,
my
dear
;
she
is
old
enough
to
know
what
she
is
about
,
and
if
not
,
has
a
mother
to
advise
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
is
too
indulgent
beyond
a
doubt
;
but
,
however
,
you
had
better
not
interfere
.
<EOS>
She
and
your
brother
choose
to
go
,
and
you
will
be
only
getting
ill
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
submitted
,
and
though
sorry
to
think
that
Isabella
should
be
doing
wrong
,
felt
greatly
relieved
by
Mr.
Allen
's
approbation
of
her
own
conduct
,
and
truly
rejoiced
to
be
preserved
by
his
advice
from
the
danger
of
falling
into
such
an
error
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
escape
from
being
one
of
the
party
to
Clifton
was
now
an
escape
indeed
;
for
what
would
the
Tilneys
have
thought
of
her
,
if
she
had
broken
her
promise
to
them
in
order
to
do
what
was
wrong
in
itself
,
if
she
had
been
guilty
of
one
breach
of
propriety
,
only
to
enable
her
to
be
guilty
of
another
?
    
<EOS>
The
next
morning
was
fair
,
and
Catherine
almost
expected
another
attack
from
the
assembled
party
.
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Allen
to
support
her
,
she
felt
no
dread
of
the
event
:
but
she
would
gladly
be
spared
a
contest
,
where
victory
itself
was
painful
,
and
was
heartily
rejoiced
therefore
at
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
anything
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
Tilneys
called
for
her
at
the
appointed
time
;
and
no
new
difficulty
arising
,
no
sudden
recollection
,
no
unexpected
summons
,
no
impertinent
intrusion
to
disconcert
their
measures
,
my
heroine
was
most
unnaturally
able
to
fulfil
her
engagement
,
though
it
was
made
with
the
hero
himself
.
<EOS>
They
determined
on
walking
round
Beechen
Cliff
,
that
noble
hill
<EOS>
whose
beautiful
verdure
and
hanging
coppice
render
it
so
striking
an
object
from
almost
every
opening
in
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
look
at
it
,
"
said
Catherine
,
as
they
walked
along
the
side
of
the
river
,
"
without
thinking
of
the
south
of
France
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
abroad
then
?
"
<EOS>
said
Henry
,
a
little
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
No
,
I
only
mean
what
I
have
read
about
.
<EOS>
It
always
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
country
that
Emily
and
her
father
travelled
through
,
in
The
Mysteries
of
Udolpho
.
<EOS>
But
you
never
read
novels
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
they
are
not
clever
enough
for
you
 
gentlemen
read
better
books
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
person
,
be
it
gentleman
or
lady
,
who
has
not
pleasure
in
a
good
novel
,
must
be
intolerably
stupid
.
<EOS>
I
have
read
all
Mrs.
Radcliffe
's
works

most
of
them
with
great
pleasure

<EOS>
The
Mysteries
of
Udolpho
,
when
I
had
once
begun
it
,
I
could
not
lay
down
again
;
I
remember
finishing
it
in
two
days
 
my
hair
standing
on
end
the
whole
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
added
Miss
Tilney
,
"
and
I
remember
that
you
undertook
to
read
it
aloud
to
me
,
and
that
when
I
was
called
away
for
only
five
minutes
to
answer
a
note
,
instead
of
waiting
for
me
,
you
took
the
volume
into
the
Hermitage
Walk
,
and
I
was
obliged
to
stay
till
you
had
finished
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Eleanor
 
a
most
honourable
testimony
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Miss
Morland
,
the
injustice
of
your
suspicions
.
<EOS>
Here
was
I
,
in
my
eagerness
to
get
on
,
refusing
to
wait
only
five
minutes
for
my
sister
,
breaking
the
promise
I
had
made
of
reading
it
aloud
,
and
keeping
her
in
suspense
at
a
most
interesting
part
,
by
running
away
with
the
volume
,
which
,
you
are
to
observe
,
was
her
own
,
particularly
her
own
.
<EOS>
I
am
proud
when
I
reflect
on
it
,
and
I
think
it
must
establish
me
in
your
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
indeed
,
and
now
I
shall
never
be
ashamed
of
liking
Udolpho
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
really
thought
before
,
young
men
despised
novels
amazingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
amazingly
;
it
may
well
suggest
amazement
if
they
do
 
for
they
read
nearly
as
many
as
women
.
<EOS>
I
myself
have
read
hundreds
and
hundreds
.
<EOS>
Do
not
imagine
that
you
can
cope
with
me
in
a
knowledge
of
Julias
and
Louisas
.
<EOS>
If
we
proceed
to
particulars
,
and
engage
in
the
never
-
ceasing
inquiry
of
"
Have
you
read
this
?
"
<EOS>
and
"
Have
you
read
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
leave
you
as
far
behind
me
as
 
what
shall
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
an
appropriate
simile
.
 
<EOS>
as
far
as
your
friend
Emily
herself
left
poor
Valancourt
when
she
went
with
her
aunt
into
Italy
.
<EOS>
Consider
how
many
years
I
have
had
the
start
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
had
entered
on
my
studies
at
Oxford
,
while
you
were
a
good
little
girl
working
your
sampler
at
home
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
very
good
,
I
am
afraid
.
<EOS>
But
now
really
,
do
not
you
think
Udolpho
the
nicest
book
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
nicest
 
<EOS>
by
which
I
suppose
you
mean
the
neatest
.
<EOS>
That
must
depend
upon
the
binding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Henry
,
"
said
Miss
Tilney
,
"
you
are
very
impertinent
.
<EOS>
Miss
Morland
,
he
is
treating
you
exactly
as
he
does
his
sister
.
<EOS>
He
is
forever
finding
fault
with
me
,
for
some
incorrectness
of
language
,
and
now
he
is
taking
the
same
liberty
with
you
.
<EOS>
The
word
"
nicest
,
"
as
you
used
it
,
did
not
suit
him
;
and
you
had
better
change
it
as
soon
as
you
can
,
or
we
shall
be
overpowered
with
Johnson
and
Blair
all
the
rest
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
am
sure
,
"
cried
Catherine
,
"
I
did
not
mean
to
say
anything
wrong
;
but
it
is
a
nice
book
,
and
why
should
not
I
call
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
"
said
Henry
,
"
and
this
is
a
very
nice
day
,
and
we
are
taking
a
very
nice
walk
,
and
you
are
two
very
nice
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
nice
word
indeed
!
<EOS>
It
does
for
everything
.
<EOS>
Originally
perhaps
it
was
applied
only
to
express
neatness
,
propriety
,
delicacy
,
or
refinement
 
people
were
nice
in
their
dress
,
in
their
sentiments
,
or
their
choice
.
<EOS>
But
now
every
commendation
on
every
subject
is
comprised
in
that
one
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
While
,
in
fact
,
"
cried
his
sister
,
"
it
ought
only
to
be
applied
to
you
,
without
any
commendation
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
are
more
nice
than
wise
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Miss
Morland
,
let
us
leave
him
to
meditate
over
our
faults
in
the
utmost
propriety
of
diction
,
while
we
praise
Udolpho
in
whatever
terms
we
like
best
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
most
interesting
work
.
<EOS>
You
are
fond
of
that
kind
of
reading
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
say
the
truth
,
I
do
not
much
like
any
other
.
"
  
"
Indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
I
can
read
poetry
and
plays
,
and
things
of
that
sort
,
and
do
not
dislike
travels
.
<EOS>
But
history
,
real
solemn
history
,
I
can
not
be
interested
in
.
<EOS>
Can
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
fond
of
history
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
were
too
.
<EOS>
I
read
it
a
little
as
a
duty
,
but
it
tells
me
nothing
that
does
not
either
vex
or
weary
me
.
<EOS>
The
quarrels
of
popes
and
kings
,
with
wars
or
pestilences
,
in
every
page
;
the
men
all
so
good
for
nothing
,
and
hardly
any
women
at
all
 
<EOS>
it
is
very
tiresome
:
<EOS>
and
yet
I
often
think
it
odd
that
it
should
be
so
dull
,
for
a
great
deal
of
it
must
be
invention
.
<EOS>
The
speeches
that
are
put
into
the
heroes
'
mouths
,
their
thoughts
and
designs
 
the
chief
of
all
this
must
be
invention
,
and
invention
is
what
delights
me
in
other
books
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Historians
,
you
think
,
"
said
Miss
Tilney
,
"
are
not
happy
in
their
flights
of
fancy
.
<EOS>
They
display
imagination
without
raising
interest
.
<EOS>
I
am
fond
of
history
 
and
am
very
well
contented
to
take
the
false
with
the
true
.
<EOS>
In
the
principal
facts
they
have
sources
of
intelligence
in
former
histories
and
records
,
which
may
be
as
much
depended
on
,
I
conclude
,
as
anything
that
does
not
actually
pass
under
one
's
own
observation
;
and
as
for
the
little
embellishments
you
speak
of
,
they
are
embellishments
,
and
I
like
them
as
such
.
<EOS>
If
a
speech
be
well
drawn
up
,
I
read
it
with
pleasure
,
by
whomsoever
it
may
be
made
 
and
probably
with
much
greater
,
if
the
production
of
Mr.
Hume
or
Mr.
Robertson
,
than
if
the
genuine
words
of
Caractacus
,
Agricola
,
or
Alfred
the
Great
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
fond
of
history
!
<EOS>
And
so
are
Mr.
Allen
and
my
father
;
and
I
have
two
brothers
who
do
not
dislike
it
.
<EOS>
So
many
instances
within
my
small
circle
of
friends
is
remarkable
!
<EOS>
At
this
rate
,
I
shall
not
pity
the
writers
of
history
any
longer
.
<EOS>
If
people
like
to
read
their
books
,
it
is
all
very
well
,
but
to
be
at
so
much
trouble
in
filling
great
volumes
,
which
,
as
I
used
to
think
,
nobody
would
willingly
ever
look
into
,
to
be
labouring
only
for
the
torment
of
little
boys
and
girls
,
always
struck
me
as
a
hard
fate
;
and
though
I
know
it
is
all
very
right
and
necessary
,
I
have
often
wondered
at
the
person
's
courage
that
could
sit
down
on
purpose
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
little
boys
and
girls
should
be
tormented
,
"
said
Henry
,
"
is
what
no
one
at
all
acquainted
with
human
nature
in
a
civilized
state
can
deny
;
but
in
behalf
of
our
most
distinguished
historians
,
I
must
observe
that
they
might
well
be
offended
at
being
supposed
to
have
no
higher
aim
,
and
that
by
their
method
and
style
,
they
are
perfectly
well
qualified
to
torment
readers
of
the
most
advanced
reason
and
mature
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
use
the
verb
"
to
torment
,
"
as
I
observed
to
be
your
own
method
,
instead
of
"
to
instruct
,
"
supposing
them
to
be
now
admitted
as
synonymous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
me
foolish
to
call
instruction
a
torment
,
but
if
you
had
been
as
much
used
as
myself
to
hear
poor
little
children
first
learning
their
letters
and
then
learning
to
spell
,
if
you
had
ever
seen
how
stupid
they
can
be
for
a
whole
morning
together
,
and
how
tired
my
poor
mother
is
at
the
end
of
it
,
as
I
am
in
the
habit
of
seeing
almost
every
day
of
my
life
at
home
,
you
would
allow
that
"
to
torment
'
and
"
to
instruct
'
might
sometimes
be
used
as
synonymous
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
probably
.
<EOS>
But
historians
are
not
accountable
for
the
difficulty
of
learning
to
read
;
and
even
you
yourself
,
who
do
not
altogether
seem
particularly
friendly
to
very
severe
,
very
intense
application
,
may
perhaps
be
brought
to
acknowledge
that
it
is
very
well
worth
-
while
to
be
tormented
for
two
or
three
years
of
one
's
life
,
for
the
sake
of
being
able
to
read
all
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
Consider
 
if
reading
had
not
been
taught
,
Mrs.
Radcliffe
would
have
written
in
vain
 
or
perhaps
might
not
have
written
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
assented
 
and
a
very
warm
panegyric
from
her
on
that
lady
's
merits
closed
the
subject
.
<EOS>
The
Tilneys
were
soon
engaged
in
another
on
which
she
had
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
They
were
viewing
the
country
with
the
eyes
of
persons
accustomed
to
drawing
,
and
decided
on
its
capability
of
being
formed
into
pictures
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
real
taste
.
<EOS>
Here
Catherine
was
quite
lost
.
<EOS>
She
knew
nothing
of
drawing
 
nothing
of
taste
:
and
she
listened
to
them
with
an
attention
which
brought
her
little
profit
,
for
they
talked
in
phrases
which
conveyed
scarcely
any
idea
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
little
which
she
could
understand
,
however
,
appeared
to
contradict
the
very
few
notions
she
had
entertained
on
the
matter
before
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
a
good
view
were
no
longer
to
be
taken
from
the
top
of
an
high
hill
,
and
that
a
clear
blue
sky
was
no
longer
a
proof
of
a
fine
day
.
<EOS>
She
was
heartily
ashamed
of
her
ignorance
.
<EOS>
A
misplaced
shame
.
<EOS>
Where
people
wish
to
attach
,
they
should
always
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
To
come
with
a
well
-
informed
mind
is
to
come
with
an
inability
of
administering
to
the
vanity
of
others
,
which
a
sensible
person
would
always
wish
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
A
woman
especially
,
if
she
have
the
misfortune
of
knowing
anything
,
should
conceal
it
as
well
as
she
can
.
  
<EOS>
The
advantages
of
natural
folly
in
a
beautiful
girl
have
been
already
set
forth
by
the
capital
pen
of
a
sister
author
;
and
to
her
treatment
of
the
subject
I
will
only
add
,
in
justice
to
men
,
that
though
to
the
larger
and
more
trifling
part
of
the
sex
,
imbecility
in
females
is
a
great
enhancement
of
their
personal
charms
,
there
is
a
portion
of
them
too
reasonable
and
too
well
informed
themselves
to
desire
anything
more
in
woman
than
ignorance
.
<EOS>
But
Catherine
did
not
know
her
own
advantages
 
did
not
know
that
a
good
-
looking
girl
,
with
an
affectionate
heart
and
a
very
ignorant
mind
,
can
not
fail
of
attracting
a
clever
young
man
,
unless
circumstances
are
particularly
untoward
.
<EOS>
In
the
present
instance
,
she
confessed
and
lamented
her
want
of
knowledge
,
declared
that
she
would
give
anything
in
the
world
to
be
able
to
draw
;
and
a
lecture
on
the
picturesque
immediately
followed
,
in
which
his
instructions
were
so
clear
that
she
soon
began
to
see
beauty
in
everything
admired
by
him
,
and
her
attention
was
so
earnest
that
he
became
perfectly
satisfied
of
her
having
a
great
deal
of
natural
taste
.
<EOS>
He
talked
of
foregrounds
,
distances
,
and
second
distances
 
side
-
screens
and
perspectives
 
lights
and
shades
;
and
Catherine
was
so
hopeful
<EOS>
a
scholar
that
when
they
gained
the
top
of
Beechen
Cliff
,
she
voluntarily
rejected
the
whole
city
of
Bath
as
unworthy
to
make
part
of
a
landscape
.
<EOS>
Delighted
with
her
progress
,
and
fearful
of
wearying
her
with
too
much
wisdom
at
once
,
Henry
suffered
the
subject
to
decline
,
and
by
an
easy
transition
from
a
piece
of
rocky
fragment
and
the
withered
oak
which
he
had
placed
near
its
summit
,
to
oaks
in
general
,
to
forests
,
the
enclosure
of
them
,
waste
lands
,
crown
lands
and
government
,
he
shortly
found
himself
arrived
at
politics
;
and
from
politics
,
it
was
an
easy
step
to
silence
.
<EOS>
The
general
pause
which
succeeded
his
short
disquisition
on
the
state
of
the
nation
was
put
an
end
to
by
Catherine
,
who
,
in
rather
a
solemn
tone
of
voice
,
uttered
these
words
,
"
I
have
heard
that
something
very
shocking
indeed
will
soon
come
out
in
London
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
,
to
whom
this
was
chiefly
addressed
,
was
startled
,
and
hastily
replied
,
"
Indeed
!
<EOS>
And
of
what
nature
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
do
not
know
,
nor
who
is
the
author
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
heard
that
it
is
to
be
more
horrible
than
anything
we
have
met
with
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
Where
could
you
hear
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
particular
friend
of
mine
had
an
account
of
it
in
a
letter
from
London
yesterday
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
uncommonly
dreadful
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
murder
and
everything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
with
astonishing
composure
!
<EOS>
But
I
hope
your
friend
's
accounts
have
been
exaggerated
;
and
if
such
a
design
is
known
beforehand
,
proper
measures
will
undoubtedly
be
taken
by
government
to
prevent
its
coming
to
effect
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Government
,
"
said
Henry
,
endeavouring
not
to
smile
,
"
neither
desires
nor
dares
to
interfere
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
murder
;
and
government
cares
not
how
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
stared
.
<EOS>
He
laughed
,
and
added
,
"
Come
,
shall
I
make
you
understand
each
other
,
or
leave
you
to
puzzle
out
an
explanation
as
you
can
?
<EOS>
No
 
I
will
be
noble
.
<EOS>
I
will
prove
myself
a
man
,
no
less
by
the
generosity
of
my
soul
than
the
clearness
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
with
such
of
my
sex
as
disdain
to
let
themselves
sometimes
down
to
the
comprehension
of
yours
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
abilities
of
women
are
neither
sound
nor
acute
 
neither
vigorous
nor
keen
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
may
want
observation
,
discernment
,
judgment
,
fire
,
genius
,
and
wit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Morland
,
do
not
mind
what
he
says
;
but
have
the
goodness
to
satisfy
me
as
to
this
dreadful
riot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Riot
!
<EOS>
What
riot
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Eleanor
,
the
riot
is
only
in
your
own
brain
.
<EOS>
The
confusion
there
is
scandalous
.
<EOS>
Miss
Morland
has
been
talking
of
nothing
more
dreadful
than
a
new
publication
which
is
shortly
to
come
out
,
in
three
duodecimo
volumes
,
two
hundred
and
seventy
-
six
pages
in
each
,
with
a
frontispiece
to
the
first
,
of
two
tombstones
and
a
lantern
 
<EOS>
do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
And
you
,
Miss
Morland
 
<EOS>
my
stupid
sister
has
mistaken
all
your
clearest
expressions
.
<EOS>
You
talked
of
expected
horrors
in
London
 
and
instead
of
instantly
conceiving
,
as
any
rational
creature
would
have
done
,
that
such
words
could
relate
only
to
a
circulating
library
,
she
immediately
pictured
to
herself
a
mob
of
three
thousand
men
assembling
in
St.
George
's
Fields
,
the
Bank
attacked
,
<EOS>
the
Tower
threatened
,
the
streets
of
London
flowing
with
blood
,
a
detachment
of
the
Twelfth
Light
Dragoons
(
the
hopes
of
the
nation
)
called
up
from
Northampton
to
quell
the
insurgents
,
and
the
gallant
Captain
Frederick
Tilney
,
in
the
moment
of
charging
at
the
head
of
his
troop
,
knocked
off
his
horse
by
a
brickbat
from
an
upper
window
.
<EOS>
Forgive
her
stupidity
.
<EOS>
The
fears
of
the
sister
have
added
to
the
weakness
of
the
woman
;
but
she
is
by
no
means
a
simpleton
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
looked
grave
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Henry
,
"
said
Miss
Tilney
,
"
that
you
have
made
us
understand
each
other
,
<EOS>
you
may
as
well
make
Miss
Morland
understand
yourself
 
unless
you
mean
to
have
her
think
you
intolerably
rude
to
your
sister
,
and
a
great
brute
in
your
opinion
of
women
in
general
.
<EOS>
Miss
Morland
is
not
used
to
your
odd
ways
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
most
happy
to
make
her
better
acquainted
with
them
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
;
but
that
is
no
explanation
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
you
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
Clear
your
character
handsomely
before
her
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
that
you
think
very
highly
of
the
understanding
of
women
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Morland
,
I
think
very
highly
of
the
understanding
of
all
the
women
in
the
world
 
especially
of
those
 
whoever
they
may
be
 
with
whom
I
happen
to
be
in
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
enough
.
<EOS>
Be
more
serious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Morland
,
no
one
can
think
more
highly
of
the
understanding
of
women
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
,
nature
has
given
them
so
much
that
they
never
find
it
necessary
to
use
more
than
half
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
get
nothing
more
serious
from
him
now
,
Miss
Morland
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
in
a
sober
mood
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
assure
you
that
he
must
be
entirely
misunderstood
,
if
he
can
ever
appear
to
say
an
unjust
thing
of
any
woman
at
all
,
or
an
unkind
one
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
no
effort
to
Catherine
to
believe
that
Henry
Tilney
could
never
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
His
manner
might
sometimes
surprise
,
but
his
meaning
must
always
be
just
:
and
what
she
did
not
understand
,
she
was
almost
as
ready
to
admire
,
as
what
she
did
.
<EOS>
The
whole
walk
was
delightful
,
and
though
it
ended
too
soon
,
its
conclusion
was
delightful
too
;
her
friends
attended
her
into
the
house
,
and
Miss
Tilney
,
before
they
parted
,
addressing
herself
with
respectful
form
,
as
much
to
Mrs.
Allen
as
to
Catherine
,
petitioned
for
the
pleasure
of
her
company
to
dinner
on
the
day
after
the
next
.
<EOS>
No
difficulty
was
made
on
Mrs.
Allen
's
side
,
and
the
only
difficulty
on
Catherine
's
was
in
concealing
the
excess
of
her
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
had
passed
away
so
charmingly
as
to
banish
all
her
friendship
and
natural
affection
,
for
no
thought
of
Isabella
or
James
had
crossed
her
during
their
walk
.
<EOS>
When
the
Tilneys
were
gone
,
she
became
amiable
again
,
but
she
was
amiable
for
some
time
to
little
effect
;
Mrs.
Allen
had
no
intelligence
to
give
that
could
relieve
her
anxiety
;
she
had
heard
nothing
of
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
end
of
the
morning
,
however
,
Catherine
,
having
occasion
for
some
indispensable
yard
of
ribbon
which
must
be
bought
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
walked
out
into
the
town
,
and
in
Bond
Street
overtook
the
second
Miss
Thorpe
as
she
was
loitering
towards
Edgar
's
Buildings
between
two
of
the
sweetest
girls
in
the
world
,
who
had
been
her
dear
friends
all
the
morning
.
<EOS>
From
her
,
she
soon
learned
that
the
party
to
Clifton
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
"
They
set
off
at
eight
this
morning
,
"
said
Miss
Anne
,
"
and
I
am
sure
I
do
not
envy
them
their
drive
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
and
I
are
very
well
off
to
be
out
of
the
scrape
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
dullest
thing
in
the
world
,
for
there
is
not
a
soul
at
Clifton
at
this
time
of
year
.
<EOS>
Belle
went
with
your
brother
,
and
John
drove
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
spoke
the
pleasure
she
really
felt
on
hearing
this
part
of
the
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
"
Maria
is
gone
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
wild
to
go
.
<EOS>
She
thought
it
would
be
something
very
fine
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
I
admire
her
taste
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
was
determined
from
the
first
not
to
go
,
if
they
pressed
me
ever
so
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
a
little
doubtful
of
this
,
could
not
help
answering
,
"
I
wish
you
could
have
gone
too
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
you
could
not
all
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
;
but
it
is
quite
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
would
not
have
gone
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
I
was
saying
so
to
Emily
and
Sophia
when
you
overtook
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
was
still
unconvinced
;
but
glad
that
Anne
should
have
the
friendship
of
an
Emily
and
a
Sophia
to
console
her
,
she
bade
her
adieu
without
much
uneasiness
,
and
returned
home
,
pleased
that
the
party
had
not
been
prevented
by
her
refusing
to
join
it
,
and
very
heartily
wishing
that
it
might
be
too
pleasant
to
allow
either
James
or
Isabella
to
resent
her
resistance
any
longer
.
    
<EOS>
Early
the
next
day
,
a
note
from
Isabella
,
speaking
peace
and
tenderness
in
every
line
,
and
entreating
the
immediate
presence
of
her
friend
on
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
,
hastened
Catherine
,
in
the
happiest
state
of
confidence
and
curiosity
,
to
Edgar
's
Buildings
.
<EOS>
The
two
youngest
Miss
Thorpes
were
by
themselves
in
the
parlour
;
and
,
on
Anne
's
quitting
it
to
call
her
sister
,
Catherine
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
the
other
for
some
particulars
of
their
yesterday
's
party
.
<EOS>
Maria
desired
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
speak
of
it
;
and
Catherine
immediately
learnt
that
it
had
been
altogether
the
most
delightful
scheme
in
the
world
,
that
nobody
could
imagine
how
charming
it
had
been
,
and
that
it
had
been
more
delightful
than
anybody
could
conceive
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
information
of
the
first
five
minutes
;
the
second
unfolded
thus
much
in
detail
 
that
they
had
driven
directly
to
the
York
Hotel
,
ate
some
soup
,
and
bespoke
an
early
dinner
,
walked
down
to
the
pump
-
room
,
tasted
the
water
,
and
laid
out
some
shillings
in
purses
and
spars
;
thence
adjourned
to
eat
ice
at
a
pastry
-
cook
's
,
and
hurrying
back
to
the
hotel
,
swallowed
their
dinner
in
haste
,
to
prevent
being
in
the
dark
;
and
then
had
a
delightful
drive
back
,
only
the
moon
was
not
up
,
and
it
rained
a
little
,
and
Mr.
Morland
's
horse
was
so
tired
he
could
hardly
get
it
along
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
listened
with
heartfelt
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
Blaize
Castle
had
never
been
thought
of
;
and
,
as
for
all
the
rest
,
there
was
nothing
to
regret
for
half
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Maria
's
intelligence
concluded
with
a
tender
effusion
of
pity
for
her
sister
Anne
,
whom
she
represented
as
insupportably
cross
,
from
being
excluded
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
never
forgive
me
,
I
am
sure
;
but
,
you
know
,
how
could
I
help
it
?
<EOS>
John
would
have
me
go
,
for
he
vowed
he
would
not
drive
her
,
because
she
had
such
thick
ankles
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
will
not
be
in
good
humour
again
this
month
;
but
I
am
determined
I
will
not
be
cross
;
it
is
not
a
little
matter
that
puts
me
out
of
temper
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
now
entered
the
room
with
so
eager
a
step
,
and
a
look
of
such
happy
importance
,
as
engaged
all
her
friend
's
notice
.
<EOS>
Maria
was
without
ceremony
sent
away
,
and
Isabella
,
embracing
Catherine
,
thus
began
:
"
Yes
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
it
is
so
indeed
;
your
penetration
has
not
deceived
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
That
arch
eye
of
yours
!
<EOS>
It
sees
through
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
replied
only
by
a
look
of
wondering
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
beloved
,
sweetest
friend
,
"
continued
the
other
,
"
compose
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
am
amazingly
agitated
,
as
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
Let
us
sit
down
and
talk
in
comfort
.
<EOS>
Well
,
and
so
you
guessed
it
the
moment
you
had
my
note
?
<EOS>
Sly
creature
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Catherine
,
you
alone
,
who
know
my
heart
,
can
judge
of
my
present
happiness
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
is
the
most
charming
of
men
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
I
were
more
worthy
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
what
will
your
excellent
father
and
mother
say
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
them
I
am
so
agitated
!
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
understanding
began
to
awake
:
an
idea
of
the
truth
suddenly
darted
into
her
mind
;
and
,
with
the
natural
blush
of
so
new
an
emotion
,
she
cried
out
,
"
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Isabella
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Can
you
 
can
you
really
be
in
love
with
James
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
bold
surmise
,
however
,
she
soon
learnt
<EOS>
comprehended
but
half
the
fact
.
<EOS>
The
anxious
affection
,
which
she
was
accused
of
having
continually
watched
in
Isabella
's
every
look
and
action
,
had
,
in
the
course
of
their
yesterday
's
party
,
received
the
delightful
confession
of
an
equal
love
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
and
faith
were
alike
engaged
to
James
.
<EOS>
Never
had
Catherine
listened
to
anything
so
full
of
interest
,
wonder
,
and
joy
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
and
her
friend
engaged
!
<EOS>
New
to
such
circumstances
,
the
importance
of
it
appeared
unspeakably
great
,
and
she
contemplated
it
as
one
of
those
grand
events
,
of
which
the
ordinary
course
of
life
can
hardly
afford
a
return
.
<EOS>
The
strength
of
her
feelings
she
could
not
express
;
the
nature
of
them
,
however
,
contented
her
friend
.
<EOS>
The
happiness
of
having
such
a
sister
was
their
first
effusion
,
and
the
fair
ladies
mingled
in
embraces
and
tears
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
Delighting
,
however
,
as
Catherine
sincerely
did
in
the
prospect
of
the
connection
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
Isabella
far
surpassed
her
in
tender
anticipations
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
so
infinitely
dearer
to
me
,
my
Catherine
,
than
either
Anne
or
Maria
:
I
feel
that
I
shall
be
so
much
more
attached
to
my
dear
Morland
's
family
than
to
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
pitch
of
friendship
beyond
Catherine
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
like
your
dear
brother
,
"
continued
Isabella
,
"
that
I
quite
doted
on
you
the
first
moment
I
saw
you
.
<EOS>
But
so
it
always
is
with
me
;
the
first
moment
settles
everything
.
<EOS>
The
very
first
day
that
Morland
came
to
us
last
Christmas
 
<EOS>
the
very
first
moment
I
beheld
him
 
<EOS>
my
heart
was
irrecoverably
gone
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
wore
my
yellow
gown
,
with
my
hair
done
up
in
braids
;
and
when
I
came
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
John
introduced
him
,
I
thought
I
never
saw
anybody
so
handsome
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Catherine
secretly
acknowledged
the
power
of
love
;
for
,
though
exceedingly
fond
of
her
brother
,
and
partial
to
all
his
endowments
,
she
had
never
in
her
life
thought
him
handsome
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
too
,
Miss
Andrews
drank
tea
with
us
that
evening
,
and
wore
her
puce
-
coloured
sarsenet
;
and
she
looked
so
heavenly
that
I
thought
your
brother
must
certainly
fall
in
love
with
her
;
I
could
not
sleep
a
wink
all
right
for
thinking
of
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Catherine
,
the
many
sleepless
nights
I
have
had
on
your
brother
's
account
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
suffer
half
what
I
have
done
!
<EOS>
I
am
grown
wretchedly
thin
,
I
know
;
but
I
will
not
pain
you
by
describing
my
anxiety
;
you
have
seen
enough
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
have
betrayed
myself
perpetually
 
so
unguarded
in
speaking
of
my
partiality
for
the
church
!
<EOS>
But
my
secret
I
was
always
sure
would
be
safe
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
felt
that
nothing
could
have
been
safer
;
but
ashamed
of
an
ignorance
little
expected
,
she
dared
no
longer
contest
the
point
,
nor
refuse
to
have
been
as
full
of
arch
penetration
and
affectionate
sympathy
as
Isabella
chose
to
consider
her
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
she
found
,
was
preparing
to
set
off
with
all
speed
to
Fullerton
,
to
make
known
his
situation
and
ask
consent
;
and
here
was
a
source
of
some
real
agitation
to
the
mind
of
Isabella
.
<EOS>
Catherine
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
,
as
she
was
herself
persuaded
,
that
her
father
and
mother
would
never
oppose
their
son
's
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
,
"
said
she
,
"
for
parents
to
be
more
kind
,
or
more
desirous
of
their
children
's
happiness
;
I
have
no
doubt
of
their
consenting
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Morland
says
exactly
the
same
,
"
replied
Isabella
;
"
and
yet
I
dare
not
expect
it
;
my
fortune
will
be
so
small
;
they
never
can
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
,
who
might
marry
anybody
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Catherine
again
discerned
the
force
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Isabella
,
you
are
too
humble
.
<EOS>
The
difference
of
fortune
can
be
nothing
to
signify
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
My
sweet
Catherine
,
in
your
generous
heart
I
know
it
would
signify
nothing
;
but
we
must
not
expect
such
disinterestedness
in
many
.
<EOS>
As
for
myself
,
I
am
sure
I
only
wish
our
situations
were
reversed
.
<EOS>
Had
I
the
command
of
millions
,
were
I
mistress
of
the
whole
world
,
your
brother
would
be
my
only
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
charming
sentiment
,
recommended
as
much
by
sense
as
novelty
,
gave
Catherine
a
most
pleasing
remembrance
of
all
the
heroines
of
her
acquaintance
;
and
she
thought
her
friend
never
looked
more
lovely
than
in
uttering
the
grand
idea
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
they
will
consent
,
"
was
her
frequent
declaration
;
"
I
am
sure
they
will
be
delighted
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
my
own
part
,
"
said
Isabella
,
"
<EOS>
my
wishes
are
so
moderate
that
the
smallest
income
in
nature
would
be
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
Where
people
are
really
attached
,
poverty
itself
is
wealth
;
grandeur
I
detest
:
I
would
not
settle
in
London
for
the
universe
.
<EOS>
A
cottage
in
some
retired
village
would
be
ecstasy
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
charming
little
villas
about
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Richmond
!
"
cried
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
settle
near
Fullerton
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
near
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
shall
be
miserable
if
we
do
not
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
but
be
near
you
,
I
shall
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
idle
talking
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
allow
myself
to
think
of
such
things
,
till
we
have
your
father
's
answer
.
<EOS>
Morland
says
that
by
sending
it
tonight
to
Salisbury
,
we
may
have
it
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
Tomorrow
?
<EOS>
I
know
I
shall
never
have
courage
to
open
the
letter
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
will
be
the
death
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
reverie
succeeded
this
conviction
 
and
when
Isabella
spoke
again
,
it
was
to
resolve
on
the
quality
of
her
wedding
-
gown
.
  
<EOS>
Their
conference
was
put
an
end
to
by
the
anxious
young
lover
himself
,
who
came
to
breathe
his
parting
sigh
before
he
set
off
for
Wiltshire
.
<EOS>
Catherine
wished
to
congratulate
him
,
but
knew
not
what
to
say
,
and
her
eloquence
was
only
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
From
them
,
however
,
the
eight
parts
of
speech
shone
out
most
expressively
,
and
James
could
combine
them
with
ease
.
<EOS>
Impatient
for
the
realization
of
all
that
he
hoped
at
home
,
his
adieus
were
not
long
;
and
they
would
have
been
yet
shorter
,
had
he
not
been
frequently
detained
by
the
urgent
entreaties
of
his
fair
one
that
he
would
go
.
<EOS>
Twice
was
he
called
almost
from
the
door
by
her
eagerness
to
have
him
gone
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Morland
,
I
must
drive
you
away
.
<EOS>
Consider
how
far
you
have
to
ride
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
linger
so
.
<EOS>
For
heaven
's
sake
,
waste
no
more
time
.
<EOS>
There
,
go
,
go
 
<EOS>
I
insist
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
friends
,
with
hearts
now
more
united
than
ever
,
were
inseparable
for
the
day
;
and
in
schemes
of
sisterly
happiness
the
hours
flew
along
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
and
her
son
,
who
were
acquainted
with
everything
,
and
who
seemed
only
to
want
Mr.
Morland
's
consent
,
to
consider
Isabella
's
engagement
as
the
most
fortunate
circumstance
imaginable
for
their
family
,
were
allowed
to
join
their
counsels
,
and
add
their
quota
of
significant
looks
and
mysterious
expressions
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
curiosity
to
be
raised
in
the
unprivileged
younger
sisters
.
<EOS>
To
Catherine
's
simple
feelings
,
this
odd
sort
of
reserve
seemed
neither
kindly
meant
,
nor
consistently
supported
;
and
its
unkindness
she
would
hardly
have
forborne
pointing
out
,
had
its
inconsistency
been
less
their
friend
;
but
Anne
and
Maria
soon
set
her
heart
at
ease
by
the
sagacity
of
their
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
"
;
and
the
evening
was
spent
in
a
sort
of
war
of
wit
,
a
display
of
family
ingenuity
,
on
one
side
in
the
mystery
of
an
affected
secret
,
on
the
other
of
undefined
discovery
,
all
equally
acute
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
was
with
her
friend
again
the
next
day
,
endeavouring
to
support
her
spirits
and
while
away
the
many
tedious
hours
before
the
delivery
of
the
letters
;
a
needful
exertion
,
for
as
the
time
of
reasonable
expectation
drew
near
,
Isabella
became
more
and
more
desponding
,
and
before
the
letter
arrived
,
had
worked
herself
into
a
state
of
real
distress
.
<EOS>
But
when
it
did
come
,
where
could
distress
be
found
?
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
no
difficulty
in
gaining
the
consent
of
my
kind
parents
,
and
am
promised
that
everything
in
their
power
shall
be
done
to
forward
my
happiness
,
"
were
the
first
three
lines
,
and
in
one
moment
all
was
joyful
security
.
<EOS>
The
brightest
glow
was
instantly
spread
over
Isabella
's
features
,
all
care
and
anxiety
seemed
removed
,
her
spirits
became
almost
too
high
for
control
,
and
she
called
herself
without
scruple
the
happiest
of
mortals
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
with
tears
of
joy
,
embraced
her
daughter
,
her
son
,
her
visitor
,
and
could
have
embraced
half
the
inhabitants
of
Bath
with
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
overflowing
with
tenderness
.
<EOS>
It
was
"
dear
John
"
and
"
dear
Catherine
"
at
every
word
;
"
dear
Anne
and
dear
Maria
"
must
immediately
be
made
sharers
in
their
felicity
;
and
two
"
dears
"
at
once
before
the
name
of
Isabella
were
not
more
than
that
beloved
child
had
now
well
earned
.
<EOS>
John
himself
was
no
skulker
in
joy
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
bestowed
on
Mr.
Morland
the
high
commendation
of
being
one
of
the
finest
fellows
in
the
world
,
but
swore
off
many
sentences
in
his
praise
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
,
whence
sprang
all
this
felicity
,
was
short
,
containing
little
more
than
this
assurance
of
success
;
and
every
particular
was
deferred
till
James
could
write
again
.
<EOS>
But
for
particulars
Isabella
could
well
afford
to
wait
.
<EOS>
The
needful
was
comprised
in
Mr.
Morland
's
promise
;
his
honour
was
pledged
to
make
everything
easy
;
and
by
what
means
their
income
was
to
be
formed
,
whether
landed
property
were
to
be
resigned
,
or
funded
money
made
over
,
was
a
matter
in
which
her
disinterested
spirit
took
no
concern
.
<EOS>
She
knew
enough
to
feel
secure
of
an
honourable
and
speedy
establishment
,
and
her
imagination
took
a
rapid
flight
over
its
attendant
felicities
.
<EOS>
She
saw
herself
at
the
end
of
a
few
weeks
,
the
gaze
and
admiration
of
every
new
acquaintance
at
Fullerton
,
the
envy
of
every
valued
old
friend
in
Putney
,
with
a
carriage
at
her
command
,
a
new
name
on
her
tickets
,
and
a
brilliant
exhibition
of
hoop
rings
on
her
finger
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
contents
of
the
letter
were
ascertained
,
John
Thorpe
,
who
had
only
waited
its
arrival
to
begin
his
journey
to
London
,
prepared
to
set
off
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Miss
Morland
,
"
said
he
,
on
finding
her
alone
in
the
parlour
,
"
I
am
come
to
bid
you
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
wished
him
a
good
journey
.
<EOS>
Without
appearing
to
hear
her
,
he
walked
to
the
window
,
fidgeted
about
,
hummed
a
tune
,
and
seemed
wholly
self
-
occupied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
not
you
be
late
at
Devizes
?
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
answer
;
but
after
a
minute
's
silence
burst
out
with
,
"
A
famous
good
thing
this
marrying
scheme
,
upon
my
soul
!
<EOS>
A
clever
fancy
of
Morland
's
and
Belle
's
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
it
,
Miss
Morland
?
<EOS>
I
say
it
is
no
bad
notion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
think
it
a
very
good
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
?
<EOS>
That
's
honest
,
by
heavens
!
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
no
enemy
to
matrimony
,
however
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
the
old
song
"
Going
to
One
Wedding
Brings
on
Another
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
you
will
come
to
Belle
's
wedding
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
I
have
promised
your
sister
to
be
with
her
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
you
know
"
 
twisting
himself
about
and
forcing
a
foolish
laugh
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
then
you
know
,
we
may
try
the
truth
of
this
same
old
song
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
we
?
<EOS>
But
I
never
sing
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
wish
you
a
good
journey
.
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Miss
Tilney
today
,
and
must
now
be
going
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
but
there
is
no
such
confounded
hurry
.
<EOS>
Who
knows
when
we
may
be
together
again
?
<EOS>
Not
but
that
I
shall
be
down
again
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
,
and
a
devilish
long
fortnight
it
will
appear
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
you
stay
away
so
long
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Catherine
 
finding
that
he
waited
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
kind
of
you
,
however
 
kind
and
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
forget
it
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
more
good
nature
and
all
that
,
than
anybody
living
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
A
monstrous
deal
of
good
nature
,
and
it
is
not
only
good
nature
,
but
you
have
so
much
,
so
much
of
everything
;
and
then
you
have
such
 
upon
my
soul
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
anybody
like
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
there
are
a
great
many
people
like
me
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
only
a
great
deal
better
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
say
,
Miss
Morland
,
I
shall
come
and
pay
my
respects
at
Fullerton
before
it
is
long
,
if
not
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
.
<EOS>
My
father
and
mother
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
hope
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Miss
Morland
,
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
dear
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
There
are
very
few
people
I
am
sorry
to
see
.
<EOS>
Company
is
always
cheerful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
my
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
Give
me
but
a
little
cheerful
company
,
let
me
only
have
the
company
of
the
people
I
love
,
let
me
only
be
where
I
like
and
with
whom
I
like
,
and
the
devil
take
the
rest
,
say
I.
<EOS>
And
I
am
heartily
glad
to
hear
you
say
the
same
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
notion
,
<EOS>
Miss
Morland
,
you
and
I
think
pretty
much
alike
upon
most
matters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
may
;
but
it
is
more
than
I
ever
thought
of
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
most
matters
,
to
say
the
truth
,
there
are
not
many
that
I
know
my
own
mind
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
,
no
more
do
I.
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
way
to
bother
my
brains
with
what
does
not
concern
me
.
<EOS>
My
notion
of
things
is
simple
enough
.
<EOS>
Let
me
only
have
the
girl
I
like
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
with
a
comfortable
house
over
my
head
,
and
what
care
I
for
all
the
rest
?
<EOS>
Fortune
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
a
good
income
of
my
own
;
and
if
she
had
not
a
penny
,
why
,
so
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
.
<EOS>
I
think
like
you
there
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
a
good
fortune
on
one
side
,
there
can
be
no
occasion
for
any
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
No
matter
which
has
it
,
so
that
there
is
enough
.
<EOS>
I
hate
the
idea
of
one
great
fortune
looking
out
for
another
.
<EOS>
And
to
marry
for
money
I
think
the
wickedest
thing
in
existence
.
<EOS>
Good
day
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you
at
Fullerton
,
whenever
it
is
convenient
.
"
<EOS>
And
away
she
went
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
the
power
of
all
his
gallantry
to
detain
her
longer
.
<EOS>
With
such
news
to
communicate
,
and
such
a
visit
to
prepare
for
,
her
departure
was
not
to
be
delayed
by
anything
in
his
nature
to
urge
;
and
she
hurried
away
,
leaving
him
to
the
undivided
consciousness
of
his
own
happy
address
,
and
her
explicit
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
The
agitation
which
she
had
herself
experienced
on
first
learning
her
brother
's
engagement
made
her
expect
to
raise
no
inconsiderable
emotion
in
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
by
the
communication
of
the
wonderful
event
.
<EOS>
How
great
was
her
disappointment
!
<EOS>
The
important
affair
,
which
many
words
of
preparation
ushered
in
,
had
been
foreseen
by
them
both
ever
since
her
brother
's
arrival
;
and
all
that
they
felt
on
the
occasion
was
comprehended
in
a
wish
for
the
young
people
's
happiness
,
with
a
remark
,
on
the
gentleman
's
side
,
in
favour
of
Isabella
's
beauty
,
and
on
the
lady
's
,
of
her
great
good
luck
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
Catherine
the
most
surprising
insensibility
.
<EOS>
The
disclosure
,
however
,
of
the
great
secret
of
James
's
going
to
Fullerton
the
day
before
,
did
raise
some
emotion
in
Mrs.
Allen
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
listen
to
that
with
perfect
calmness
,
but
repeatedly
regretted
the
necessity
of
its
concealment
,
wished
she
could
have
known
his
intention
,
<EOS>
wished
she
could
have
seen
him
before
he
went
,
as
she
should
certainly
have
troubled
him
with
her
best
regards
to
his
father
and
mother
,
and
her
kind
compliments
to
all
the
Skinners
.
    
<EOS>
Catherine
's
expectations
of
pleasure
from
her
visit
in
Milsom
Street
were
so
very
high
that
disappointment
was
inevitable
;
and
accordingly
,
though
she
was
most
politely
received
by
General
Tilney
,
and
kindly
welcomed
by
his
daughter
,
though
Henry
was
at
home
,
and
no
one
else
of
the
party
,
she
found
,
on
her
return
,
without
spending
many
hours
in
the
examination
of
her
feelings
,
that
she
had
gone
to
her
appointment
preparing
for
happiness
which
it
had
not
afforded
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
finding
herself
improved
in
acquaintance
with
Miss
Tilney
,
from
the
intercourse
of
the
day
,
she
seemed
hardly
so
intimate
with
her
as
before
;
instead
of
seeing
Henry
Tilney
to
greater
advantage
than
ever
,
in
the
ease
of
a
family
party
,
he
had
never
said
so
little
,
nor
been
so
little
agreeable
;
and
,
in
spite
of
their
father
's
great
civilities
to
her
 
in
spite
of
his
thanks
,
invitations
,
and
compliments
 
it
had
been
a
release
to
get
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
puzzled
her
to
account
for
all
this
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
General
Tilney
's
fault
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
perfectly
agreeable
and
good
-
natured
,
and
altogether
a
very
charming
man
,
did
not
admit
of
a
doubt
,
for
he
was
tall
and
handsome
,
and
Henry
's
father
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
accountable
for
his
children
's
want
of
spirits
,
or
for
her
want
of
enjoyment
in
his
company
.
<EOS>
The
former
she
hoped
at
last
might
have
been
accidental
,
and
the
latter
she
could
only
attribute
to
her
own
stupidity
.
<EOS>
Isabella
,
on
hearing
the
particulars
of
the
visit
,
gave
a
different
explanation
:
"
It
was
all
pride
,
pride
,
insufferable
haughtiness
and
pride
!
<EOS>
She
had
long
suspected
the
family
to
be
very
high
,
and
this
made
it
certain
.
<EOS>
Such
insolence
of
behaviour
as
Miss
Tilney
's
she
had
never
heard
of
in
her
life
!
<EOS>
Not
to
do
the
honours
of
her
house
with
common
good
breeding
!
<EOS>
To
behave
to
her
guest
with
such
superciliousness
!
<EOS>
Hardly
even
to
speak
to
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
not
so
bad
as
that
,
Isabella
;
there
was
no
superciliousness
;
she
was
very
civil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Do
n't
defend
her
!
<EOS>
And
then
the
brother
,
he
,
who
had
appeared
so
attached
to
you
!
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
Well
,
some
people
's
feelings
are
incomprehensible
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
hardly
looked
once
at
you
the
whole
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
so
;
but
he
did
not
seem
in
good
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
contemptible
!
<EOS>
Of
all
things
in
the
world
inconstancy
is
my
aversion
.
<EOS>
Let
me
entreat
you
never
to
think
of
him
again
,
my
dear
Catherine
;
indeed
he
is
unworthy
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unworthy
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
he
ever
thinks
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
exactly
what
I
say
;
he
never
thinks
of
you
.
<EOS>
Such
fickleness
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
How
different
to
your
brother
and
to
mine
!
<EOS>
I
really
believe
John
has
the
most
constant
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
as
for
General
Tilney
,
I
assure
you
it
would
be
impossible
for
anybody
to
behave
to
me
with
greater
civility
and
attention
;
it
seemed
to
be
his
only
care
to
entertain
and
make
me
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
know
no
harm
of
him
;
I
do
not
suspect
him
of
pride
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
is
a
very
gentleman
-
like
man
.
<EOS>
John
thinks
very
well
of
him
,
and
John
's
judgment
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
,
I
shall
see
how
they
behave
to
me
this
evening
;
we
shall
meet
them
at
the
rooms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
must
I
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
you
intend
it
?
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
all
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
since
you
make
such
a
point
of
it
,
I
can
refuse
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
insist
upon
my
being
very
agreeable
,
for
my
heart
<EOS>
,
you
know
,
will
be
some
forty
miles
off
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
dancing
,
do
not
mention
it
,
I
beg
;
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Charles
Hodges
will
plague
me
to
death
,
I
dare
say
;
but
I
shall
cut
him
very
short
.
<EOS>
Ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
he
guesses
the
reason
,
and
that
is
exactly
what
I
want
to
avoid
,
so
I
shall
insist
on
his
keeping
his
conjecture
to
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
's
opinion
of
the
Tilneys
did
not
influence
her
friend
;
she
was
sure
there
had
been
no
insolence
in
the
manners
either
of
brother
or
sister
;
and
she
did
not
credit
there
being
any
pride
in
their
hearts
.
<EOS>
The
evening
rewarded
her
confidence
;
she
was
met
by
one
with
the
same
kindness
,
and
by
the
other
with
the
same
attention
,
as
heretofore
:
Miss
Tilney
took
pains
to
be
near
her
,
and
Henry
asked
her
to
dance
.
  
<EOS>
Having
heard
the
day
before
in
Milsom
Street
that
their
elder
brother
,
Captain
Tilney
,
was
expected
almost
every
hour
,
she
was
at
no
loss
for
the
name
of
a
very
fashionable
-
looking
,
handsome
young
man
,
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
,
and
who
now
evidently
belonged
to
their
party
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
with
great
admiration
,
and
even
supposed
it
possible
that
some
people
might
think
him
handsomer
than
his
brother
,
though
,
in
her
eyes
,
his
air
was
more
assuming
,
and
his
countenance
less
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
His
taste
and
manners
were
beyond
a
doubt
decidedly
inferior
;
for
,
within
her
hearing
,
he
not
only
protested
against
every
thought
of
dancing
himself
,
but
even
laughed
openly
at
Henry
for
finding
it
possible
.
<EOS>
From
the
latter
circumstance
it
may
be
presumed
that
,
whatever
might
be
our
heroine
's
opinion
of
him
,
his
admiration
of
her
was
not
of
a
very
dangerous
kind
;
not
likely
to
produce
animosities
between
the
brothers
,
nor
persecutions
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
the
instigator
of
the
three
villains
in
horsemen
's
greatcoats
,
by
whom
she
will
hereafter
be
forced
into
a
traveling
-
chaise
and
four
,
which
will
drive
off
with
incredible
speed
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
meanwhile
,
undisturbed
by
presentiments
of
such
an
evil
,
or
of
any
evil
at
all
,
except
that
of
having
but
a
short
set
to
dance
down
,
enjoyed
her
usual
happiness
with
Henry
Tilney
,
listening
with
sparkling
eyes
to
everything
he
said
;
and
,
in
finding
him
irresistible
,
becoming
so
herself
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
first
dance
,
Captain
Tilney
came
towards
them
again
,
and
,
much
to
Catherine
's
dissatisfaction
,
pulled
his
brother
away
.
<EOS>
They
retired
whispering
together
;
and
,
though
her
delicate
sensibility
did
not
take
immediate
alarm
,
and
lay
it
down
as
fact
,
that
Captain
Tilney
must
have
heard
some
malevolent
misrepresentation
of
her
,
which
he
now
hastened
to
communicate
to
his
brother
,
in
the
hope
of
separating
them
forever
,
she
could
not
have
her
partner
conveyed
from
her
sight
without
very
uneasy
sensations
.
<EOS>
Her
suspense
was
of
full
five
minutes
'
duration
;
and
she
was
beginning
to
think
it
a
very
long
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
they
both
returned
,
and
an
explanation
was
given
,
by
Henry
's
requesting
to
know
if
she
thought
her
friend
,
Miss
Thorpe
,
would
have
any
objection
to
dancing
,
as
his
brother
would
be
most
happy
to
be
introduced
to
her
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
without
hesitation
,
replied
that
she
was
very
sure
<EOS>
Miss
Thorpe
did
not
mean
to
dance
at
all
.
<EOS>
The
cruel
reply
was
passed
on
to
the
other
,
and
he
immediately
walked
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
brother
will
not
mind
it
,
I
know
,
"
said
she
,
"
because
I
heard
him
say
before
that
he
hated
dancing
;
but
it
was
very
good
-
natured
in
him
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
saw
Isabella
sitting
down
,
and
fancied
she
might
wish
for
a
partner
;
but
he
is
quite
mistaken
,
for
she
would
not
dance
upon
any
account
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Henry
smiled
,
and
said
,
"
How
very
little
trouble
it
can
give
you
to
understand
the
motive
of
other
people
's
actions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
you
,
it
is
not
,
How
is
such
a
one
likely
to
be
influenced
,
What
is
the
inducement
most
likely
to
act
upon
such
a
person
's
feelings
,
age
,
situation
,
and
probable
habits
of
life
considered
 
<EOS>
but
,
How
should
I
be
influenced
<EOS>
,
What
would
be
my
inducement
in
acting
so
and
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
are
on
very
unequal
terms
,
for
I
understand
you
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
?
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
can
not
speak
well
enough
to
be
unintelligible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
<EOS>
An
excellent
satire
on
modern
language
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
pray
tell
me
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
indeed
?
<EOS>
Do
you
really
desire
it
?
<EOS>
But
you
are
not
aware
of
the
consequences
;
it
will
involve
you
in
a
very
cruel
embarrassment
,
and
certainly
bring
on
a
disagreement
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
it
shall
not
do
either
;
I
am
not
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
only
meant
that
your
attributing
my
brother
's
wish
of
dancing
with
Miss
Thorpe
to
good
nature
alone
convinced
me
of
your
being
superior
in
good
nature
yourself
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
blushed
and
disclaimed
,
and
the
gentleman
's
predictions
were
verified
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
something
,
however
,
in
his
words
which
repaid
her
for
the
pain
of
confusion
;
and
that
something
occupied
her
mind
so
much
that
she
drew
back
for
some
time
,
forgetting
to
speak
or
to
listen
,
and
almost
forgetting
where
she
was
;
till
,
roused
by
the
voice
of
Isabella
,
she
looked
up
and
saw
her
with
Captain
Tilney
preparing
to
give
them
hands
across
.
  
<EOS>
Isabella
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
smiled
,
the
only
explanation
of
this
extraordinary
change
which
could
at
that
time
be
given
;
but
as
it
was
not
quite
enough
for
Catherine
's
comprehension
,
she
spoke
her
astonishment
in
very
plain
terms
to
her
partner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
how
it
could
happen
!
<EOS>
Isabella
was
so
determined
not
to
dance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
Isabella
never
change
her
mind
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
But
,
because
 
And
your
brother
!
<EOS>
After
what
you
told
him
from
me
,
how
could
he
think
of
going
to
ask
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
take
surprise
to
myself
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
You
bid
me
be
surprised
on
your
friend
's
account
,
and
therefore
I
am
;
but
as
for
my
brother
,
his
conduct
in
the
business
,
I
must
own
,
<EOS>
has
been
no
more
than
I
believed
him
perfectly
equal
to
.
<EOS>
The
fairness
of
your
friend
was
an
open
attraction
;
her
firmness
,
you
know
,
could
only
be
understood
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
laughing
;
but
,
I
assure
you
,
Isabella
is
very
firm
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
much
as
should
be
said
of
anyone
.
<EOS>
To
be
always
firm
must
be
to
be
often
obstinate
.
<EOS>
When
properly
to
relax
is
the
trial
of
judgment
;
and
,
without
reference
to
my
brother
,
I
really
think
Miss
Thorpe
has
by
no
means
chosen
ill
in
fixing
on
the
present
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
friends
were
not
able
to
get
together
for
any
confidential
discourse
till
all
the
dancing
was
over
;
but
then
,
as
they
walked
about
the
room
arm
in
arm
,
Isabella
thus
explained
herself
:
"
I
do
not
wonder
at
your
surprise
;
and
I
am
really
fatigued
to
death
.
<EOS>
He
is
such
a
rattle
!
<EOS>
Amusing
enough
,
if
my
mind
had
been
disengaged
;
but
I
would
have
given
the
world
to
sit
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
did
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
My
dear
!
<EOS>
It
would
have
looked
so
particular
;
and
you
know
how
I
abhor
doing
that
.
<EOS>
I
refused
him
as
long
as
I
possibly
could
,
but
he
would
take
no
denial
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
how
he
pressed
me
.
<EOS>
I
begged
him
to
excuse
me
,
and
get
some
other
partner
 
<EOS>
but
no
,
not
he
;
after
aspiring
to
my
hand
,
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
room
he
could
bear
to
think
of
;
and
it
was
not
that
he
wanted
merely
to
dance
<EOS>
,
he
wanted
to
be
with
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Such
nonsense
!
<EOS>
I
told
him
he
had
taken
a
very
unlikely
way
to
prevail
upon
me
;
for
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
I
hated
fine
speeches
and
compliments
;
and
so
 
<EOS>
and
so
then
I
found
there
would
be
no
peace
if
I
did
not
stand
up
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
thought
Mrs.
Hughes
,
who
introduced
him
,
might
take
it
ill
if
I
did
not
:
and
<EOS>
your
dear
brother
,
I
am
sure
he
would
have
been
miserable
if
I
had
sat
down
the
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
it
is
over
!
<EOS>
My
spirits
are
quite
jaded
with
listening
to
his
nonsense
:
and
then
,
being
such
a
smart
young
fellow
,
I
saw
every
eye
was
upon
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
handsome
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Handsome
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
suppose
he
may
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
people
would
admire
him
in
general
;
but
he
is
not
at
all
in
my
style
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
hate
a
florid
complexion
and
dark
eyes
in
a
man
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
is
very
well
.
<EOS>
Amazingly
conceited
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
I
took
him
down
several
times
,
you
know
,
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
young
ladies
next
met
,
they
had
a
far
more
interesting
subject
to
discuss
.
<EOS>
James
Morland
's
second
letter
was
then
received
,
and
the
kind
intentions
of
his
father
fully
explained
.
<EOS>
A
living
,
of
which
Mr.
Morland
was
himself
patron
and
incumbent
,
of
about
four
hundred
pounds
yearly
value
,
was
to
be
resigned
to
his
son
as
soon
as
he
should
be
old
enough
to
take
it
;
no
trifling
deduction
from
the
family
income
,
no
niggardly
assignment
to
one
of
ten
children
.
<EOS>
An
estate
of
at
least
equal
value
,
moreover
,
was
assured
as
his
future
inheritance
.
  
<EOS>
James
expressed
himself
on
the
occasion
with
becoming
gratitude
;
and
the
necessity
of
waiting
between
two
and
three
years
before
they
could
marry
,
being
,
however
unwelcome
,
no
more
than
he
had
expected
,
was
borne
by
him
without
discontent
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
whose
expectations
had
been
as
unfixed
as
her
ideas
of
her
father
's
income
,
and
whose
judgment
was
now
entirely
led
by
her
brother
,
felt
equally
well
satisfied
,
and
heartily
congratulated
Isabella
on
having
everything
so
pleasantly
settled
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
charming
indeed
,
"
said
Isabella
,
with
a
grave
face
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Morland
has
behaved
vastly
handsome
indeed
,
"
said
the
gentle
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
looking
anxiously
at
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
I
could
do
as
much
.
<EOS>
One
could
not
expect
more
from
him
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
If
he
finds
he
can
do
more
by
and
by
,
I
dare
say
he
will
,
for
I
am
sure
he
must
be
an
excellent
good
-
hearted
man
.
<EOS>
Four
hundred
is
but
a
small
income
to
begin
on
indeed
,
but
your
wishes
,
my
dear
Isabella
,
are
so
moderate
<EOS>
,
you
do
not
consider
how
little
you
ever
want
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
on
my
own
account
I
wish
for
more
;
but
I
can
not
bear
to
be
the
means
of
injuring
my
dear
Morland
,
making
him
sit
down
upon
an
income
hardly
enough
to
find
one
in
the
common
necessaries
of
life
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
it
is
nothing
;
I
never
think
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
never
do
,
my
dear
;
and
you
will
always
find
your
reward
in
the
affection
it
makes
everybody
feel
for
you
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
young
woman
so
beloved
as
you
are
by
everybody
that
knows
you
;
and
I
dare
say
when
Mr.
Morland
sees
you
,
my
dear
child
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
let
us
distress
our
dear
Catherine
by
talking
of
such
things
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Morland
has
behaved
so
very
handsome
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
always
heard
he
was
a
most
excellent
man
;
and
you
know
,
my
dear
,
we
are
not
to
suppose
<EOS>
but
what
,
if
you
had
had
a
suitable
fortune
,
he
would
have
come
down
with
something
more
,
for
I
am
sure
he
must
be
a
most
liberal
-
minded
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
can
think
better
of
Mr.
Morland
than
I
do
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
But
everybody
has
their
failing
,
you
know
,
and
everybody
has
a
right
to
do
what
they
like
with
their
own
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
was
hurt
by
these
insinuations
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sure
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
my
father
has
promised
to
do
as
much
as
he
can
afford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Isabella
recollected
herself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
that
,
my
sweet
Catherine
,
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
,
and
you
know
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
a
much
smaller
income
would
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
the
want
of
more
money
that
makes
me
just
at
present
a
little
out
of
spirits
;
I
hate
money
;
and
if
our
union
could
take
place
now
upon
only
fifty
pounds
a
year
,
I
should
not
have
a
wish
unsatisfied
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
Catherine
,
you
have
found
me
out
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
sting
.
<EOS>
The
long
,
long
,
endless
two
years
and
half
that
are
to
pass
before
your
brother
can
hold
the
living
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
my
darling
Isabella
,
"
said
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
"
we
perfectly
see
into
your
heart
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
disguise
.
<EOS>
We
perfectly
understand
the
present
vexation
;
and
everybody
must
love
you
the
better
for
such
a
noble
honest
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
uncomfortable
feelings
began
to
lessen
.
<EOS>
She
endeavoured
to
believe
that
the
delay
of
the
marriage
was
the
only
source
of
Isabella
's
regret
;
and
when
she
saw
her
at
their
next
interview
as
cheerful
and
amiable
as
ever
,
endeavoured
to
forget
that
she
had
for
a
minute
thought
otherwise
.
<EOS>
James
soon
followed
his
letter
,
and
was
received
with
the
most
gratifying
kindness
.
    
<EOS>
The
Allens
had
now
entered
on
the
sixth
week
of
their
stay
in
Bath
;
and
whether
it
should
be
the
last
was
for
some
time
a
question
,
to
which
Catherine
listened
with
a
beating
heart
.
<EOS>
To
have
her
acquaintance
with
the
Tilneys
end
so
soon
was
an
evil
which
nothing
could
counterbalance
.
<EOS>
Her
whole
happiness
seemed
at
stake
,
while
the
affair
was
in
suspense
,
and
everything
secured
when
it
was
determined
that
the
lodgings
should
be
taken
for
another
fortnight
.
<EOS>
What
this
additional
fortnight
was
to
produce
to
her
beyond
the
pleasure
of
sometimes
seeing
Henry
Tilney
made
but
a
small
part
of
Catherine
's
speculation
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
indeed
,
since
James
's
engagement
had
taught
her
what
could
be
done
,
she
had
got
so
far
as
to
indulge
in
a
secret
"
perhaps
,
"
but
in
general
the
felicity
of
being
with
him
for
the
present
bounded
her
views
:
the
present
was
now
comprised
in
another
three
weeks
,
and
her
happiness
being
certain
for
that
period
,
the
rest
of
her
life
was
at
such
a
distance
as
to
excite
but
little
interest
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
morning
which
saw
this
business
arranged
,
she
visited
Miss
Tilney
,
and
poured
forth
her
joyful
feelings
.
<EOS>
It
was
doomed
to
be
a
day
of
trial
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
she
expressed
her
delight
in
Mr.
Allen
's
lengthened
stay
than
Miss
Tilney
told
her
of
her
father
's
having
just
determined
upon
quitting
Bath
by
the
end
of
another
week
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
blow
!
<EOS>
The
past
suspense
of
the
morning
had
been
ease
and
quiet
to
the
present
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
countenance
fell
,
and
in
a
voice
of
most
sincere
concern
she
echoed
Miss
Tilney
's
concluding
words
,
"
By
the
end
of
another
week
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
father
can
seldom
be
prevailed
on
to
give
the
waters
what
I
think
a
fair
trial
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
disappointed
of
some
friends
'
arrival
whom
he
expected
to
meet
here
,
and
as
he
is
now
pretty
well
,
is
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
,
"
said
Catherine
dejectedly
;
"
if
I
had
known
this
before
 
"
  
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
Miss
Tilney
in
an
embarrassed
manner
,
"
you
would
be
so
good
 
<EOS>
it
would
make
me
very
happy
if
 
"
  
The
entrance
of
her
father
put
a
stop
to
the
civility
,
which
Catherine
was
beginning
to
hope
might
introduce
a
desire
of
their
corresponding
.
<EOS>
After
addressing
her
with
his
usual
politeness
,
he
turned
to
his
daughter
and
said
,
"
Well
,
Eleanor
,
may
I
congratulate
you
on
being
successful
in
your
application
to
your
fair
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
beginning
to
make
the
request
,
sir
,
as
you
came
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
proceed
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
much
your
heart
is
in
it
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
,
Miss
Morland
,
"
he
continued
,
without
leaving
his
daughter
time
to
speak
,
"
has
been
forming
a
very
bold
wish
.
<EOS>
We
leave
Bath
,
as
she
has
perhaps
told
you
,
on
Saturday
se'nnight
.
<EOS>
A
letter
from
my
steward
tells
me
that
my
presence
is
wanted
at
home
;
and
being
disappointed
in
my
hope
of
seeing
the
Marquis
of
Longtown
and
General
Courteney
here
,
some
of
my
very
old
friends
,
there
is
nothing
to
detain
me
longer
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
And
could
we
carry
our
selfish
point
with
you
,
we
should
leave
it
without
a
single
regret
.
<EOS>
Can
you
,
in
short
,
be
prevailed
on
to
quit
this
scene
of
public
triumph
and
oblige
your
friend
Eleanor
with
your
company
in
Gloucestershire
?
<EOS>
I
am
almost
ashamed
to
make
the
request
,
though
its
presumption
would
certainly
appear
greater
to
every
creature
in
Bath
than
yourself
.
<EOS>
Modesty
such
as
yours
 
but
not
for
the
world
<EOS>
would
I
pain
it
by
open
praise
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
be
induced
to
honour
us
with
a
visit
,
you
will
make
us
happy
beyond
expression
.
'
<EOS>
tis
true
,
we
can
offer
you
nothing
like
the
gaieties
of
this
lively
place
;
we
can
tempt
you
neither
by
amusement
nor
splendour
,
for
our
mode
of
living
,
as
you
see
,
is
plain
and
unpretending
;
yet
no
endeavours
shall
be
wanting
on
our
side
to
make
Northanger
Abbey
not
wholly
disagreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Northanger
Abbey
!
<EOS>
These
were
thrilling
words
,
and
wound
up
Catherine
's
feelings
to
the
highest
point
of
ecstasy
.
<EOS>
Her
grateful
and
gratified
heart
could
hardly
restrain
its
expressions
within
the
language
of
tolerable
calmness
.
<EOS>
To
receive
so
flattering
an
invitation
!
<EOS>
To
have
her
company
so
warmly
solicited
!
<EOS>
Everything
honourable
and
soothing
,
every
present
enjoyment
,
and
every
future
hope
was
contained
in
it
;
and
her
acceptance
,
with
only
the
saving
clause
of
Papa
and
Mamma
's
approbation
,
was
eagerly
given
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
home
directly
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
if
they
do
not
object
,
as
I
dare
say
they
will
not
 
"
  
General
Tilney
was
not
less
sanguine
,
having
already
waited
on
her
excellent
friends
in
Pulteney
Street
,
and
obtained
their
sanction
of
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
Since
they
can
consent
to
part
with
you
,
"
said
he
,
"
we
may
expect
philosophy
from
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
was
earnest
,
though
gentle
,
in
her
secondary
civilities
,
and
the
affair
became
in
a
few
minutes
as
nearly
settled
as
this
necessary
reference
to
Fullerton
would
allow
.
  
<EOS>
The
circumstances
of
the
morning
had
led
Catherine
's
feelings
through
the
varieties
of
suspense
,
security
,
and
disappointment
;
but
they
were
now
safely
lodged
in
perfect
bliss
;
and
with
spirits
elated
to
rapture
,
with
Henry
at
her
heart
,
and
Northanger
Abbey
on
her
lips
,
she
hurried
home
to
write
her
letter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
,
relying
on
the
discretion
of
the
friends
to
whom
they
had
already
entrusted
their
daughter
,
felt
no
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
an
acquaintance
which
had
been
formed
under
their
eye
,
and
sent
therefore
by
return
of
post
their
ready
consent
to
her
visit
in
Gloucestershire
.
<EOS>
This
indulgence
,
though
not
more
than
Catherine
had
hoped
for
,
completed
her
conviction
of
being
favoured
beyond
every
other
human
creature
,
in
friends
and
fortune
,
circumstance
and
chance
.
<EOS>
Everything
seemed
to
cooperate
for
her
advantage
.
<EOS>
By
the
kindness
of
her
first
friends
,
the
Allens
,
she
had
been
introduced
into
scenes
where
pleasures
of
every
kind
had
met
her
.
<EOS>
Her
feelings
,
her
preferences
,
had
each
known
the
happiness
of
a
return
.
<EOS>
Wherever
she
felt
attachment
,
she
had
been
able
to
create
it
.
<EOS>
The
affection
of
Isabella
was
to
be
secured
to
her
in
a
sister
.
<EOS>
The
Tilneys
,
they
,
by
whom
,
above
all
,
she
desired
to
be
favourably
thought
of
,
outstripped
even
her
wishes
in
the
flattering
measures
by
which
their
intimacy
was
to
be
continued
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
be
their
chosen
visitor
,
she
was
to
be
for
weeks
under
the
same
roof
with
the
person
whose
society
she
mostly
prized
 
and
,
<EOS>
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
,
this
roof
was
to
be
the
roof
of
an
abbey
!
<EOS>
Her
passion
for
ancient
edifices
was
next
in
degree
to
her
passion
for
Henry
Tilney
 
and
castles
and
abbeys
made
usually
the
charm
of
those
reveries
which
his
image
did
not
fill
.
<EOS>
To
see
and
explore
either
the
ramparts
and
keep
of
the
one
,
or
the
cloisters
of
the
other
,
had
been
for
many
weeks
a
darling
wish
,
though
to
be
more
than
the
visitor
of
an
hour
had
seemed
too
nearly
impossible
for
desire
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
this
was
to
happen
.
<EOS>
With
all
the
chances
against
her
of
house
,
hall
,
place
,
park
,
court
,
and
cottage
,
Northanger
turned
up
an
abbey
,
and
she
was
to
be
its
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
Its
long
,
damp
passages
,
its
narrow
cells
and
ruined
chapel
,
were
to
be
within
her
daily
reach
,
and
she
could
not
entirely
subdue
the
hope
of
some
traditional
legends
,
some
awful
memorials
of
an
injured
and
ill
-
fated
nun
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
wonderful
that
her
friends
should
seem
so
little
elated
by
the
possession
of
such
a
home
,
that
the
consciousness
of
it
should
be
so
meekly
borne
.
<EOS>
The
power
of
early
habit
only
could
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
A
distinction
to
which
they
had
been
born
gave
no
pride
.
<EOS>
Their
superiority
of
abode
was
no
more
to
them
than
their
superiority
of
person
.
  
<EOS>
Many
were
the
inquiries
she
was
eager
to
make
of
Miss
Tilney
;
but
so
active
were
her
thoughts
,
that
when
these
inquiries
were
answered
,
she
was
hardly
more
assured
than
before
,
of
<EOS>
Northanger
Abbey
having
been
a
richly
endowed
convent
at
the
time
of
the
Reformation
,
of
its
having
fallen
into
the
hands
of
an
ancestor
of
the
Tilneys
on
its
dissolution
,
of
a
large
portion
of
the
ancient
building
still
making
a
part
of
the
present
dwelling
although
the
rest
was
decayed
,
or
of
its
standing
low
in
a
valley
,
sheltered
from
the
north
and
east
by
rising
woods
of
oak
.
    
<EOS>
With
a
mind
thus
full
of
happiness
,
Catherine
was
hardly
aware
that
two
or
three
days
had
passed
away
,
without
her
seeing
Isabella
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
together
.
<EOS>
She
began
first
to
be
sensible
of
this
,
and
to
sigh
for
her
conversation
,
as
she
walked
along
the
pump
-
room
one
morning
,
by
Mrs.
Allen
's
side
,
without
anything
to
say
or
to
hear
;
and
scarcely
had
she
felt
a
five
minutes
'
longing
of
friendship
,
before
the
object
of
it
appeared
,
and
inviting
her
to
a
secret
conference
,
led
the
way
to
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
is
my
favourite
place
,
"
said
she
as
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
between
the
doors
,
which
commanded
a
tolerable
view
of
everybody
entering
at
either
;
"
it
is
so
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
observing
that
Isabella
's
eyes
were
continually
bent
towards
one
door
or
the
other
,
as
in
eager
expectation
,
and
remembering
how
often
she
had
been
falsely
accused
of
being
arch
,
thought
the
present
a
fine
opportunity
for
being
really
so
;
and
therefore
gaily
said
,
"
Do
not
be
uneasy
,
Isabella
,
James
will
soon
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
My
dear
creature
,
"
she
replied
,
"
do
not
think
me
such
a
simpleton
as
to
be
always
wanting
to
confine
him
to
my
elbow
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
hideous
to
be
always
together
;
we
should
be
the
jest
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
are
going
to
Northanger
!
<EOS>
I
am
amazingly
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
the
finest
old
places
in
England
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
I
shall
depend
upon
a
most
particular
description
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
certainly
have
the
best
in
my
power
to
give
.
<EOS>
But
who
are
you
looking
for
?
<EOS>
Are
your
sisters
coming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
looking
for
anybody
.
<EOS>
One
's
eyes
must
be
somewhere
,
and
you
know
what
a
foolish
trick
I
have
of
fixing
mine
,
when
my
thoughts
are
an
hundred
miles
off
.
<EOS>
I
am
amazingly
absent
;
I
believe
I
am
the
most
absent
creature
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Tilney
says
it
is
always
the
case
with
minds
of
a
certain
stamp
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
thought
,
Isabella
,
you
had
something
in
particular
to
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
<EOS>
and
so
I
have
.
<EOS>
But
here
is
a
proof
of
what
I
was
saying
.
<EOS>
My
poor
head
,
I
had
quite
forgot
it
.
<EOS>
Well
,
the
thing
is
this
:
I
have
just
had
a
letter
from
John
;
you
can
guess
the
contents
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sweet
love
,
do
not
be
so
abominably
affected
.
<EOS>
What
can
he
write
about
,
but
yourself
?
<EOS>
You
know
he
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
me
,
dear
Isabella
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
sweetest
Catherine
,
this
is
being
quite
absurd
!
<EOS>
Modesty
,
and
all
that
,
is
very
well
in
its
way
,
but
really
a
little
common
honesty
is
sometimes
quite
as
becoming
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
of
being
so
overstrained
!
<EOS>
It
is
fishing
for
compliments
.
<EOS>
His
attentions
were
such
as
a
child
must
have
noticed
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
but
<EOS>
half
an
hour
before
he
left
Bath
that
you
gave
him
the
most
positive
encouragement
.
<EOS>
He
says
so
in
this
letter
,
says
that
he
as
good
as
made
you
an
offer
,
and
that
you
received
his
advances
in
the
kindest
way
;
and
now
he
wants
me
to
urge
his
suit
,
and
say
all
manner
of
pretty
things
to
you
.
<EOS>
So
it
is
in
vain
to
affect
ignorance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
with
all
the
earnestness
of
truth
,
expressed
her
astonishment
at
such
a
charge
,
protesting
her
innocence
of
every
thought
of
Mr.
Thorpe
's
being
in
love
with
her
,
and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
her
having
ever
intended
to
encourage
him
.
"
<EOS>
As
to
any
attentions
on
his
side
,
I
do
declare
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
never
was
sensible
of
them
for
a
moment
 
except
just
his
asking
me
to
dance
the
first
day
of
his
coming
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
making
me
an
offer
,
or
anything
like
it
,
there
must
be
some
unaccountable
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
misunderstood
a
thing
of
that
kind
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
And
,
as
I
ever
wish
to
be
believed
,
I
solemnly
protest
that
no
syllable
of
such
a
nature
ever
passed
between
us
.
<EOS>
The
last
half
hour
before
he
went
away
!
<EOS>
It
must
be
all
and
completely
a
mistake
 
<EOS>
for
I
did
not
see
him
once
that
whole
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
that
you
certainly
did
,
for
you
spent
the
whole
morning
in
Edgar
's
Buildings
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
day
your
father
's
consent
came
 
and
I
am
pretty
sure
that
you
and
John
were
alone
in
the
parlour
some
time
before
you
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
?
<EOS>
Well
,
if
you
say
it
,
it
was
so
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
 
<EOS>
but
for
the
life
of
me
,
I
can
not
recollect
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
remember
now
being
with
you
,
and
seeing
him
as
well
as
the
rest
 
<EOS>
but
that
we
were
ever
alone
for
five
minutes
 
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
not
worth
arguing
about
,
for
whatever
might
pass
on
his
side
,
you
must
be
convinced
,
by
my
having
no
recollection
of
it
,
that
I
never
thought
,
nor
expected
,
nor
wished
for
anything
of
the
kind
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
excessively
concerned
that
he
should
have
any
regard
for
me
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
it
has
been
quite
unintentional
on
my
side
;
I
never
had
the
smallest
idea
of
it
.
<EOS>
Pray
undeceive
him
as
soon
as
you
can
,
and
tell
him
I
beg
his
pardon
 
<EOS>
that
is
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
I
ought
to
say
 
but
make
him
understand
what
I
mean
,
in
the
properest
way
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
speak
disrespectfully
of
a
brother
of
yours
,
Isabella
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
;
but
you
know
very
well
that
if
I
could
think
of
one
man
more
than
another
 
<EOS>
he
is
not
the
person
.
<EOS>
"
Isabella
was
silent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
suppose
your
brother
cares
so
very
much
about
me
.
<EOS>
And
,
you
know
,
we
shall
still
be
sisters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
"
(
with
a
blush
)
,
"
there
are
more
ways
than
one
of
our
being
sisters
.
<EOS>
But
where
am
I
wandering
to
?
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
the
case
seems
to
be
that
you
are
determined
against
poor
John
 
is
not
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
can
not
return
his
affection
,
and
as
certainly
never
meant
to
encourage
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Since
that
is
the
case
,
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
tease
you
any
further
.
<EOS>
John
desired
me
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
,
and
therefore
I
have
.
<EOS>
But
I
confess
,
as
soon
as
I
read
his
letter
,
I
thought
it
a
very
foolish
,
imprudent
business
,
and
not
likely
to
promote
the
good
of
either
;
for
what
were
you
to
live
upon
,
supposing
you
came
together
?
<EOS>
You
have
both
of
you
something
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
is
not
a
trifle
that
will
support
a
family
nowadays
;
and
after
all
that
romancers
may
say
,
there
is
no
doing
without
money
.
<EOS>
I
only
wonder
John
could
think
of
it
;
he
could
not
have
received
my
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
acquit
me
,
then
,
of
anything
wrong
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
convinced
that
I
never
meant
to
deceive
your
brother
,
never
suspected
him
of
liking
me
till
this
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
As
to
that
,
"
answered
Isabella
laughingly
,
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
determine
what
your
thoughts
and
designs
in
time
past
may
have
been
.
<EOS>
All
that
is
best
known
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
A
little
harmless
flirtation
or
so
will
occur
,
and
one
is
often
drawn
on
to
give
more
encouragement
than
one
wishes
to
stand
by
.
<EOS>
But
you
may
be
assured
that
I
am
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
judge
you
severely
.
<EOS>
All
those
things
should
be
allowed
for
in
youth
and
high
spirits
.
<EOS>
What
one
means
one
day
,
you
know
,
one
may
not
mean
the
next
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
change
,
opinions
alter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
my
opinion
of
your
brother
never
did
alter
;
it
was
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
You
are
describing
what
never
happened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Catherine
,
"
continued
the
other
without
at
all
listening
to
her
,
"
I
would
not
for
all
the
world
be
the
means
of
hurrying
you
into
an
engagement
before
you
knew
what
you
were
about
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
anything
would
justify
me
in
wishing
you
to
sacrifice
all
your
happiness
merely
to
oblige
my
brother
,
because
he
is
my
brother
,
and
who
perhaps
after
all
,
you
know
,
might
be
just
as
happy
without
you
,
for
people
seldom
know
what
they
would
be
at
,
young
men
especially
,
they
are
so
amazingly
changeable
and
inconstant
.
<EOS>
What
I
say
is
,
why
should
a
brother
's
happiness
be
dearer
to
me
than
a
friend
's
?
<EOS>
You
know
I
carry
my
notions
of
friendship
pretty
high
.
<EOS>
But
,
above
all
things
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
Take
my
word
for
it
,
that
if
you
are
in
too
great
a
hurry
,
you
will
certainly
live
to
repent
it
.
<EOS>
Tilney
says
there
is
nothing
people
are
so
often
deceived
in
as
the
state
of
their
own
affections
,
and
I
believe
he
is
very
right
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Here
he
comes
;
never
mind
,
he
will
not
see
us
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
looking
up
,
perceived
Captain
Tilney
;
and
Isabella
,
earnestly
fixing
her
eye
on
him
as
she
spoke
,
soon
caught
his
notice
.
<EOS>
He
approached
immediately
,
and
took
the
seat
to
which
her
movements
invited
him
.
<EOS>
His
first
address
made
Catherine
start
.
<EOS>
Though
spoken
low
,
she
could
distinguish
,
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
Always
to
be
watched
,
in
person
or
by
proxy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
,
nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
was
Isabella
's
answer
in
the
same
half
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
put
such
things
into
my
head
?
<EOS>
If
I
could
believe
it
 
<EOS>
my
spirit
,
you
know
,
is
pretty
independent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
your
heart
were
independent
.
<EOS>
That
would
be
enough
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
heart
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
What
can
you
have
to
do
with
hearts
?
<EOS>
You
men
have
none
of
you
any
hearts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
have
not
hearts
,
we
have
eyes
;
and
they
give
us
torment
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
they
?
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
it
;
I
am
sorry
they
find
anything
so
disagreeable
in
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
look
another
way
.
<EOS>
I
hope
this
pleases
you
"
(
turning
her
back
on
him
)
;
"
I
hope
your
eyes
are
not
tormented
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
more
so
;
for
the
edge
of
a
blooming
cheek
is
still
in
view
 
at
once
too
much
and
too
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
heard
all
this
,
and
quite
out
of
countenance
,
could
listen
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Amazed
that
Isabella
could
endure
it
,
and
jealous
for
her
brother
,
she
rose
up
,
and
saying
she
should
join
Mrs.
Allen
,
proposed
their
walking
.
<EOS>
But
for
this
Isabella
showed
no
inclination
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
amazingly
tired
,
and
it
was
so
odious
to
parade
about
the
pump
-
room
;
and
if
she
moved
from
her
seat
she
should
miss
her
sisters
;
she
was
expecting
her
sisters
every
moment
;
so
that
her
dearest
Catherine
must
excuse
her
,
and
must
sit
quietly
down
again
.
<EOS>
But
Catherine
could
be
stubborn
too
;
and
Mrs.
Allen
just
then
coming
up
to
propose
their
returning
home
,
she
joined
her
and
walked
out
of
the
pump
-
room
,
leaving
Isabella
still
sitting
with
Captain
Tilney
.
<EOS>
With
much
uneasiness
did
she
thus
leave
them
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
her
that
Captain
Tilney
was
falling
in
love
with
Isabella
,
and
Isabella
unconsciously
encouraging
him
;
unconsciously
it
must
be
,
for
Isabella
's
attachment
to
James
was
as
certain
and
well
acknowledged
as
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
To
doubt
her
truth
or
good
intentions
was
impossible
;
and
yet
,
during
the
whole
of
their
conversation
her
manner
had
been
odd
.
<EOS>
She
wished
Isabella
had
talked
more
like
her
usual
self
,
and
not
so
much
about
money
,
and
had
not
looked
so
well
pleased
at
the
sight
of
Captain
Tilney
.
<EOS>
How
strange
that
she
should
not
perceive
his
admiration
!
<EOS>
Catherine
longed
to
give
her
a
hint
of
it
,
to
put
her
on
her
guard
,
and
prevent
all
the
pain
which
her
too
lively
behaviour
might
otherwise
create
both
for
him
and
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
The
compliment
of
John
Thorpe
's
affection
did
not
make
amends
for
this
thoughtlessness
in
his
sister
.
<EOS>
She
was
almost
as
far
from
believing
as
from
wishing
it
to
be
sincere
;
for
she
had
not
forgotten
that
he
could
mistake
,
and
his
assertion
of
the
offer
and
of
her
encouragement
convinced
her
that
his
mistakes
could
sometimes
be
very
egregious
.
<EOS>
In
vanity
,
therefore
,
she
gained
but
little
;
her
chief
profit
was
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
That
he
should
think
it
worth
his
while
to
fancy
himself
in
love
with
her
<EOS>
was
a
matter
of
lively
astonishment
.
<EOS>
Isabella
talked
of
his
attentions
;
she
had
never
been
sensible
of
any
;
but
Isabella
had
said
many
things
which
she
hoped
had
been
spoken
in
haste
,
and
would
never
be
said
again
;
and
upon
this
she
was
glad
to
rest
altogether
for
present
ease
and
comfort
.
    
<EOS>
A
few
days
passed
away
,
and
Catherine
,
though
not
allowing
herself
to
suspect
her
friend
,
could
not
help
watching
her
closely
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
her
observations
was
not
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Isabella
seemed
an
altered
creature
.
<EOS>
When
she
saw
her
,
indeed
,
surrounded
only
by
their
immediate
friends
in
Edgar
's
Buildings
or
Pulteney
Street
,
her
change
of
manners
was
so
trifling
that
,
had
it
gone
no
farther
<EOS>
,
it
might
have
passed
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
A
something
of
languid
indifference
,
or
of
that
boasted
absence
of
mind
which
Catherine
had
never
heard
of
before
,
would
occasionally
come
across
her
;
but
had
nothing
worse
appeared
,
that
might
only
have
spread
a
new
grace
and
inspired
a
warmer
interest
.
<EOS>
But
when
Catherine
saw
her
in
public
,
admitting
Captain
Tilney
's
attentions
as
readily
as
they
were
offered
,
and
allowing
him
almost
an
equal
share
with
James
in
her
notice
and
smiles
,
the
alteration
became
too
positive
to
be
passed
over
.
<EOS>
What
could
be
meant
by
such
unsteady
conduct
,
what
her
friend
could
be
at
,
was
beyond
her
comprehension
.
<EOS>
Isabella
could
not
be
aware
of
the
pain
she
was
inflicting
;
but
it
was
a
degree
of
wilful
thoughtlessness
which
Catherine
could
not
but
resent
.
<EOS>
James
was
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
She
saw
him
grave
and
uneasy
;
and
however
careless
of
his
present
comfort
the
woman
might
be
who
had
given
him
her
heart
,
to
her
it
was
always
an
object
.
<EOS>
For
poor
Captain
Tilney
too
she
was
greatly
concerned
.
<EOS>
Though
his
looks
did
not
please
her
,
his
name
was
a
passport
to
her
goodwill
,
and
she
thought
with
sincere
compassion
of
his
approaching
disappointment
;
for
,
in
spite
of
what
she
had
believed
herself
to
overhear
in
the
pump
-
room
,
his
behaviour
was
so
incompatible
with
a
knowledge
of
Isabella
's
engagement
that
she
could
not
,
upon
reflection
,
imagine
him
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
jealous
of
her
brother
as
a
rival
,
but
if
more
had
seemed
implied
,
the
fault
must
have
been
in
her
misapprehension
.
<EOS>
She
wished
,
by
a
gentle
remonstrance
,
to
remind
Isabella
of
her
situation
,
and
make
her
aware
of
this
double
unkindness
;
but
for
remonstrance
,
either
opportunity
or
comprehension
was
always
against
her
.
<EOS>
If
able
to
suggest
a
hint
,
Isabella
could
never
understand
it
.
<EOS>
In
this
distress
,
the
intended
departure
of
the
Tilney
family
became
her
chief
consolation
;
their
journey
into
Gloucestershire
was
to
take
place
within
a
few
days
,
and
Captain
Tilney
's
removal
would
at
least
restore
peace
to
every
heart
but
his
own
.
<EOS>
But
Captain
Tilney
had
at
present
no
intention
of
removing
;
he
was
not
to
be
of
the
party
to
Northanger
;
he
was
to
continue
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
When
Catherine
knew
this
,
her
resolution
was
directly
made
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
to
Henry
Tilney
on
the
subject
,
regretting
his
brother
's
evident
partiality
for
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
entreating
him
to
make
known
her
prior
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
does
know
it
,
"
was
Henry
's
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
?
<EOS>
Then
why
does
he
stay
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
reply
,
and
was
beginning
to
talk
of
something
else
;
but
she
eagerly
continued
,
"
Why
do
not
you
persuade
him
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
The
longer
he
stays
,
the
worse
it
will
be
for
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
Pray
advise
him
for
his
own
sake
,
and
for
everybody
's
sake
,
to
leave
Bath
directly
.
<EOS>
Absence
will
in
time
make
him
comfortable
again
;
but
he
can
have
no
hope
here
,
and
it
is
only
staying
to
be
miserable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Henry
smiled
and
said
,
"
I
am
sure
my
brother
would
not
wish
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
persuade
him
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Persuasion
is
not
at
command
;
but
pardon
me
,
if
I
can
not
even
endeavour
to
persuade
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
myself
told
him
that
Miss
Thorpe
is
engaged
.
<EOS>
He
knows
what
he
is
about
,
and
must
be
his
own
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
does
not
know
what
he
is
about
,
"
cried
Catherine
;
"
he
does
not
know
the
pain
he
is
giving
my
brother
.
<EOS>
Not
that
James
has
ever
told
me
so
,
but
I
am
sure
he
is
very
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
are
you
sure
it
is
my
brother
's
doing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
my
brother
's
attentions
to
Miss
Thorpe
,
or
Miss
Thorpe
's
admission
of
them
,
that
gives
the
pain
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
not
it
the
same
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Mr.
Morland
would
acknowledge
a
difference
.
<EOS>
No
man
is
offended
by
another
man
's
admiration
of
the
woman
he
loves
;
it
is
the
woman
only
who
can
make
it
a
torment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
blushed
for
her
friend
,
and
said
,
"
Isabella
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
sure
she
can
not
mean
to
torment
,
for
she
is
very
much
attached
to
my
brother
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
in
love
with
him
ever
since
they
first
met
,
and
while
my
father
's
consent
was
uncertain
,
she
fretted
herself
almost
into
a
fever
.
<EOS>
You
know
she
must
be
attached
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
:
she
is
in
love
with
James
,
and
flirts
with
Frederick
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
no
,
not
flirts
.
<EOS>
A
woman
in
love
with
one
man
can
not
flirt
with
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
probable
that
she
will
neither
love
so
well
,
nor
flirt
<EOS>
so
well
,
as
she
might
do
either
singly
.
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
must
each
give
up
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
,
Catherine
resumed
with
,
"
Then
you
do
not
believe
Isabella
so
very
much
attached
to
my
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
have
no
opinion
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
your
brother
mean
?
<EOS>
If
he
knows
her
engagement
,
what
can
he
mean
by
his
behaviour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
close
questioner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
?
<EOS>
I
only
ask
what
I
want
to
be
told
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
only
ask
what
I
can
be
expected
to
tell
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
so
;
for
you
must
know
your
brother
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
's
heart
,
as
you
term
it
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
I
assure
you
I
can
only
guess
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
it
is
to
be
guesswork
,
let
us
all
guess
for
ourselves
.
<EOS>
To
be
guided
by
second
-
hand
conjecture
is
pitiful
.
<EOS>
The
premises
are
before
you
.
<EOS>
My
brother
is
a
lively
and
perhaps
sometimes
a
thoughtless
young
man
;
he
has
had
about
a
week
's
acquaintance
with
your
friend
,
and
he
has
known
her
engagement
almost
as
long
as
he
has
known
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Catherine
,
after
some
moments
'
consideration
,
"
you
may
be
able
to
guess
at
your
brother
's
intentions
from
all
this
;
but
I
am
sure
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
But
is
not
your
father
uncomfortable
about
it
?
<EOS>
Does
not
he
want
Captain
Tilney
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
Sure
,
if
your
father
were
to
speak
to
him
,
he
would
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Morland
,
"
said
Henry
,
"
in
this
amiable
solicitude
for
your
brother
's
comfort
,
may
you
not
be
a
little
mistaken
?
<EOS>
Are
you
not
carried
a
little
too
far
?
<EOS>
Would
he
thank
you
,
either
on
his
own
account
or
<EOS>
Miss
Thorpe
's
,
for
supposing
that
her
affection
,
or
at
least
her
good
behaviour
,
is
only
to
be
secured
by
her
seeing
nothing
of
Captain
Tilney
?
<EOS>
Is
he
safe
only
in
solitude
?
<EOS>
Or
is
her
heart
constant
to
him
only
when
unsolicited
by
anyone
else
?
<EOS>
He
can
not
think
this
 
<EOS>
and
you
may
be
sure
that
he
would
not
have
you
think
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
,
"
Do
not
be
uneasy
,
"
because
I
know
that
you
are
so
,
at
this
moment
;
but
be
as
little
uneasy
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
doubt
of
the
mutual
attachment
of
your
brother
and
your
friend
;
depend
upon
it
,
therefore
,
that
real
jealousy
never
can
exist
between
them
;
depend
upon
it
that
no
disagreement
between
them
can
be
of
any
duration
.
<EOS>
Their
hearts
are
open
to
each
other
,
as
neither
heart
can
be
to
you
;
they
know
exactly
what
is
required
and
what
can
be
borne
;
and
you
may
be
certain
that
one
will
never
tease
the
other
beyond
what
is
known
to
be
pleasant
.
"
  
<EOS>
Perceiving
her
still
to
look
doubtful
and
grave
,
he
added
,
"
Though
Frederick
does
not
leave
Bath
with
us
,
he
will
probably
remain
but
a
very
short
time
,
perhaps
only
a
few
days
behind
us
.
<EOS>
His
leave
of
absence
will
soon
expire
,
and
he
must
return
to
his
regiment
.
<EOS>
And
what
will
then
be
their
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
The
mess
-
room
will
drink
Isabella
Thorpe
for
a
fortnight
,
and
she
will
laugh
with
your
brother
over
poor
Tilney
's
passion
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
would
contend
no
longer
against
comfort
.
<EOS>
She
had
resisted
its
approaches
during
the
whole
length
of
a
speech
,
but
it
now
carried
her
captive
.
<EOS>
Henry
Tilney
must
know
best
.
<EOS>
She
blamed
herself
for
the
extent
of
her
fears
,
and
resolved
never
to
think
so
seriously
on
the
subject
again
.
  
<EOS>
Her
resolution
was
supported
by
Isabella
's
behaviour
in
their
parting
interview
.
<EOS>
The
Thorpes
spent
the
last
evening
of
Catherine
's
stay
in
Pulteney
Street
,
and
nothing
passed
between
the
lovers
to
excite
her
uneasiness
,
or
make
her
quit
them
in
apprehension
.
<EOS>
James
was
in
excellent
spirits
,
and
Isabella
most
engagingly
placid
.
<EOS>
Her
tenderness
for
her
friend
seemed
rather
the
first
feeling
of
her
heart
;
but
that
at
such
a
moment
was
allowable
;
and
once
she
gave
her
lover
a
flat
contradiction
,
and
once
she
drew
back
her
hand
;
but
Catherine
remembered
Henry
's
instructions
,
and
placed
it
all
to
judicious
affection
.
<EOS>
The
embraces
,
tears
,
and
promises
of
the
parting
fair
ones
may
be
fancied
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
were
sorry
to
lose
their
young
friend
,
whose
good
humour
and
cheerfulness
had
made
her
a
valuable
companion
,
and
in
the
promotion
of
whose
enjoyment
their
own
had
been
gently
increased
.
<EOS>
Her
happiness
in
going
with
Miss
Tilney
,
however
,
prevented
their
wishing
it
otherwise
;
and
,
as
they
were
to
remain
only
one
more
week
in
Bath
themselves
,
her
quitting
them
now
would
not
long
be
felt
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
attended
her
to
Milsom
Street
,
where
she
was
to
breakfast
,
and
saw
her
seated
with
the
kindest
welcome
among
her
new
friends
;
but
so
great
was
her
agitation
in
finding
herself
as
one
of
the
family
,
and
so
fearful
was
she
of
not
doing
exactly
what
was
right
,
and
of
not
being
able
to
preserve
their
good
opinion
,
that
,
in
the
embarrassment
of
the
first
five
minutes
,
she
could
almost
have
wished
to
return
with
him
to
Pulteney
Street
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
's
manners
and
Henry
's
smile
soon
did
away
some
of
her
unpleasant
feelings
;
but
still
she
was
far
from
being
at
ease
;
nor
could
the
incessant
attentions
of
the
general
himself
entirely
reassure
her
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
perverse
as
it
seemed
,
she
doubted
whether
she
might
not
have
felt
less
,
had
she
been
less
attended
to
.
<EOS>
His
anxiety
for
her
comfort
 
<EOS>
his
continual
solicitations
that
she
would
eat
,
and
his
often
-
expressed
fears
of
her
seeing
nothing
to
her
taste
 
though
never
in
her
life
<EOS>
before
had
she
beheld
half
such
variety
on
a
breakfast
-
table
 
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
forget
for
a
moment
that
she
was
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
She
felt
utterly
unworthy
of
such
respect
,
and
knew
not
how
to
reply
to
it
.
<EOS>
Her
tranquillity
was
not
improved
by
the
general
's
impatience
for
the
appearance
of
his
eldest
son
,
nor
by
the
displeasure
he
expressed
at
his
laziness
when
Captain
Tilney
at
last
came
down
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
pained
by
the
severity
of
his
father
's
reproof
,
which
seemed
disproportionate
to
the
offence
;
and
much
was
her
concern
increased
when
she
found
herself
the
principal
cause
of
the
lecture
,
and
that
his
tardiness
was
chiefly
resented
from
being
disrespectful
to
her
.
<EOS>
This
was
placing
her
in
a
very
uncomfortable
situation
,
and
she
felt
great
compassion
for
Captain
Tilney
,
without
being
able
to
hope
for
his
goodwill
.
  
<EOS>
He
listened
to
his
father
in
silence
,
and
attempted
not
any
defence
,
which
confirmed
her
in
fearing
that
the
inquietude
of
his
mind
,
on
Isabella
's
account
,
might
,
by
keeping
him
long
sleepless
,
have
been
the
real
cause
of
<EOS>
his
rising
late
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
of
her
being
decidedly
in
his
company
,
and
she
had
hoped
to
be
now
able
to
form
her
opinion
of
him
;
but
she
scarcely
heard
his
voice
while
his
father
remained
in
the
room
;
and
even
afterwards
,
so
much
were
his
spirits
affected
,
she
could
distinguish
nothing
but
these
words
,
in
a
whisper
to
Eleanor
,
"
How
glad
I
shall
be
when
you
are
all
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bustle
of
going
was
not
pleasant
.
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
ten
while
the
trunks
were
carrying
down
,
and
the
general
had
fixed
to
be
out
of
Milsom
Street
by
that
hour
.
<EOS>
His
greatcoat
,
instead
of
being
brought
for
him
to
put
on
directly
,
was
spread
out
in
the
curricle
in
which
he
was
to
accompany
his
son
.
<EOS>
The
middle
seat
of
the
chaise
was
not
drawn
out
,
though
there
were
three
people
to
go
in
it
,
and
his
daughter
's
maid
had
so
crowded
it
with
parcels
that
Miss
Morland
would
not
have
room
to
sit
;
and
,
so
much
was
he
influenced
by
this
apprehension
when
he
handed
her
in
,
that
she
had
some
difficulty
in
saving
her
own
new
writing
-
desk
from
being
thrown
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
the
door
was
closed
upon
the
three
females
,
and
they
set
off
at
the
sober
pace
in
which
the
handsome
,
highly
fed
four
horses
of
a
gentleman
usually
perform
a
journey
of
thirty
miles
:
<EOS>
such
was
the
distance
of
Northanger
from
Bath
,
to
be
now
divided
into
two
equal
stages
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
spirits
revived
as
they
drove
from
the
door
;
for
with
Miss
Tilney
she
felt
no
restraint
;
and
,
with
the
interest
of
a
road
entirely
new
to
her
,
of
an
abbey
before
,
and
a
curricle
behind
,
she
caught
the
last
view
of
Bath
without
any
regret
,
and
met
with
every
milestone
before
she
expected
it
.
<EOS>
The
tediousness
of
a
two
hours
'
wait
at
Petty
France
,
in
which
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
eat
without
being
hungry
,
and
loiter
about
without
anything
to
see
,
next
followed
 
and
her
admiration
of
the
style
in
which
they
travelled
,
of
the
fashionable
chaise
and
four
 
postilions
handsomely
liveried
,
rising
so
regularly
in
their
stirrups
,
and
numerous
outriders
properly
mounted
,
sunk
a
little
under
this
consequent
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
Had
their
party
been
perfectly
agreeable
,
the
delay
would
have
been
nothing
;
but
General
Tilney
,
though
so
charming
a
man
,
seemed
always
a
check
upon
his
children
's
spirits
,
and
scarcely
anything
was
said
but
by
himself
;
the
observation
of
which
,
with
his
discontent
at
whatever
the
inn
afforded
,
and
his
angry
impatience
at
the
waiters
,
made
Catherine
grow
every
moment
more
in
awe
of
him
,
and
appeared
to
lengthen
the
two
hours
into
four
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
the
order
of
release
was
given
;
and
much
was
Catherine
then
surprised
by
the
general
's
proposal
of
her
taking
his
place
in
his
son
's
curricle
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
:
"
the
day
was
fine
,
and
he
was
anxious
for
her
seeing
as
much
of
the
country
as
possible
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
Mr.
Allen
's
opinion
,
respecting
young
men
's
open
carriages
,
made
her
blush
at
the
mention
of
such
a
plan
,
and
her
first
thought
was
to
decline
it
;
but
her
second
was
of
greater
deference
for
General
Tilney
's
judgment
;
he
could
not
propose
anything
improper
for
her
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
,
she
found
herself
with
Henry
in
the
curricle
,
as
happy
a
being
as
ever
existed
.
<EOS>
A
very
short
trial
convinced
her
that
a
curricle
was
the
prettiest
equipage
in
the
world
;
the
chaise
and
four
wheeled
off
with
some
grandeur
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
was
a
heavy
and
troublesome
business
,
and
she
could
not
easily
forget
its
having
stopped
two
hours
at
Petty
France
.
<EOS>
Half
the
time
would
have
been
enough
for
the
curricle
,
and
so
nimbly
were
the
light
horses
disposed
to
move
,
that
,
had
not
the
general
chosen
to
have
his
own
carriage
lead
the
way
,
they
could
have
passed
it
with
ease
in
half
a
minute
.
<EOS>
But
the
merit
of
the
curricle
did
not
all
belong
to
the
horses
;
Henry
drove
so
well
 
<EOS>
so
quietly
 
without
making
any
disturbance
,
without
parading
to
her
,
or
swearing
at
them
:
so
different
from
the
only
gentleman
-
coachman
whom
it
was
in
her
power
to
compare
him
with
!
<EOS>
And
then
his
hat
sat
so
well
,
and
the
innumerable
capes
of
his
greatcoat
looked
so
becomingly
important
!
<EOS>
To
be
driven
by
him
,
next
to
being
dancing
with
him
,
was
certainly
the
greatest
happiness
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
every
other
delight
,
she
had
now
that
of
listening
to
her
own
praise
;
of
being
thanked
at
least
,
on
his
sister
's
account
,
for
her
kindness
in
thus
becoming
her
visitor
;
of
hearing
it
ranked
as
real
friendship
,
and
described
as
creating
real
gratitude
.
<EOS>
His
sister
,
he
said
,
was
uncomfortably
circumstanced
 
<EOS>
she
had
no
female
companion
 
and
,
in
the
frequent
absence
of
her
father
,
was
sometimes
without
any
companion
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
can
that
be
?
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
Are
not
you
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Northanger
is
not
more
than
half
my
home
;
I
have
an
establishment
at
my
own
house
in
Woodston
,
which
is
nearly
twenty
miles
from
my
father
's
,
and
some
of
my
time
is
necessarily
spent
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
sorry
you
must
be
for
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
always
sorry
to
leave
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
besides
your
affection
for
her
,
you
must
be
so
fond
of
the
abbey
!
<EOS>
After
being
used
to
such
a
home
as
the
abbey
,
an
ordinary
parsonage
-
house
must
be
very
disagreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
and
said
,
"
You
have
formed
a
very
favourable
idea
of
the
abbey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
I
have
.
<EOS>
Is
not
it
a
fine
old
place
,
just
like
what
one
reads
about
?
"
  
"
And
are
you
prepared
to
encounter
all
the
horrors
that
a
building
such
as
"
what
one
reads
about
'
may
produce
?
<EOS>
Have
you
a
stout
heart
?
<EOS>
Nerves
fit
for
sliding
panels
and
tapestry
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
should
be
easily
frightened
,
because
there
would
be
so
many
people
in
the
house
 
and
besides
,
it
has
never
been
uninhabited
and
left
deserted
for
years
,
and
then
the
family
come
back
to
it
unawares
,
without
giving
any
notice
,
as
generally
happens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
have
to
explore
our
way
into
a
hall
dimly
lighted
by
the
expiring
embers
of
a
wood
fire
 
nor
be
obliged
to
spread
our
beds
on
the
floor
of
a
room
without
windows
,
doors
,
or
furniture
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
be
aware
that
when
a
young
lady
is
(
by
whatever
means
)
introduced
into
a
dwelling
of
this
kind
<EOS>
,
she
is
always
lodged
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
While
they
snugly
repair
to
their
own
end
of
the
house
,
she
is
formally
conducted
by
Dorothy
,
the
ancient
housekeeper
,
up
a
different
staircase
,
and
along
many
gloomy
passages
,
into
an
apartment
never
used
since
some
cousin
or
kin
died
in
it
about
twenty
years
before
.
<EOS>
Can
you
stand
such
a
ceremony
as
this
?
<EOS>
Will
not
your
mind
misgive
you
when
you
find
yourself
in
this
gloomy
chamber
 
too
lofty
and
extensive
for
you
,
with
only
the
feeble
rays
of
a
single
lamp
to
take
in
its
size
 
its
walls
hung
with
tapestry
exhibiting
figures
as
large
as
life
,
and
the
bed
,
of
dark
green
stuff
or
purple
velvet
,
presenting
even
a
funereal
appearance
?
<EOS>
Will
not
your
heart
sink
within
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
But
this
will
not
happen
to
me
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
fearfully
will
you
examine
the
furniture
of
your
apartment
!
<EOS>
And
what
will
you
discern
?
<EOS>
Not
tables
,
toilettes
,
wardrobes
,
or
drawers
,
but
on
one
side
perhaps
the
remains
of
a
broken
lute
,
on
the
other
a
ponderous
chest
which
no
efforts
can
open
,
and
over
the
fireplace
the
portrait
of
some
handsome
warrior
,
whose
features
will
so
incomprehensibly
strike
you
,
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
withdraw
your
eyes
from
it
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
,
meanwhile
,
no
less
struck
by
your
appearance
,
gazes
on
you
in
great
agitation
,
and
drops
a
few
unintelligible
hints
.
<EOS>
To
raise
your
spirits
,
moreover
,
she
gives
you
reason
to
suppose
that
the
part
of
the
abbey
you
inhabit
is
undoubtedly
haunted
,
and
informs
you
that
you
will
not
have
a
single
domestic
within
call
.
<EOS>
With
this
parting
cordial
she
curtsies
off
 
you
listen
to
the
sound
of
her
receding
footsteps
as
long
as
the
last
echo
can
reach
you
 
and
when
,
with
fainting
spirits
,
you
attempt
to
fasten
your
door
,
you
discover
,
with
increased
alarm
,
that
it
has
no
lock
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
,
how
frightful
!
<EOS>
This
is
just
like
a
book
!
<EOS>
But
it
can
not
really
happen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
your
housekeeper
is
not
really
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
Well
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
further
to
alarm
perhaps
may
occur
the
first
night
.
<EOS>
After
surmounting
your
unconquerable
horror
of
the
bed
,
you
will
retire
to
rest
,
and
get
a
few
hours
'
unquiet
slumber
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
second
,
or
at
farthest
the
third
night
after
your
arrival
,
you
will
probably
have
a
violent
storm
.
<EOS>
Peals
of
thunder
so
loud
as
to
seem
to
shake
the
edifice
to
its
foundation
will
roll
round
the
neighbouring
mountains
 
and
during
the
frightful
gusts
of
wind
which
accompany
it
,
you
will
probably
think
you
discern
(
for
your
lamp
is
not
extinguished
)
<EOS>
one
part
of
the
hanging
more
violently
agitated
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Unable
of
course
to
repress
your
curiosity
in
so
favourable
a
moment
for
indulging
it
,
you
will
instantly
arise
,
and
throwing
your
dressing
-
gown
around
you
,
proceed
to
examine
this
mystery
.
<EOS>
After
a
very
short
search
,
you
will
discover
a
division
in
the
tapestry
so
artfully
constructed
as
to
defy
the
minutest
inspection
,
and
on
opening
it
,
a
door
will
immediately
appear
 
which
door
,
being
only
secured
by
massy
bars
and
a
padlock
,
you
will
,
after
a
few
efforts
,
succeed
in
opening
 
and
,
with
your
lamp
in
your
hand
,
will
pass
through
it
into
a
small
vaulted
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
indeed
;
I
should
be
too
much
frightened
to
do
any
such
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Not
when
Dorothy
has
given
you
to
understand
that
there
is
a
secret
subterraneous
communication
between
your
apartment
and
the
chapel
of
St.
Anthony
,
scarcely
two
miles
off
?
<EOS>
Could
you
shrink
from
so
simple
an
adventure
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
you
will
proceed
into
this
small
vaulted
room
,
and
through
this
into
several
others
,
without
perceiving
anything
very
remarkable
in
either
.
<EOS>
In
one
perhaps
there
may
be
a
dagger
,
in
another
a
few
drops
of
blood
,
and
in
a
third
the
remains
of
some
instrument
of
torture
;
but
there
being
nothing
in
all
this
out
of
the
common
way
,
and
your
lamp
being
nearly
exhausted
,
you
will
return
towards
your
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
In
repassing
through
the
small
vaulted
room
,
however
,
your
eyes
will
be
attracted
towards
a
large
,
old
-
fashioned
cabinet
of
ebony
and
gold
,
which
,
though
narrowly
examining
the
furniture
before
,
you
had
passed
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
Impelled
by
an
irresistible
presentiment
,
you
will
eagerly
advance
to
it
,
unlock
its
folding
doors
,
and
search
into
every
drawer
 
but
for
some
time
without
discovering
anything
of
importance
 
perhaps
nothing
but
a
considerable
hoard
of
diamonds
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
by
touching
a
secret
spring
,
an
inner
compartment
will
open
 
<EOS>
a
roll
of
paper
appears
 
you
seize
it
 
it
contains
many
sheets
of
manuscript
 
<EOS>
you
hasten
with
the
precious
treasure
into
your
own
chamber
,
but
scarcely
have
you
been
able
to
decipher
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Thou
 
<EOS>
whomsoever
thou
mayst
be
,
into
whose
hands
these
memoirs
of
the
wretched
Matilda
may
fall
"
 
when
your
lamp
suddenly
expires
in
the
socket
,
and
leaves
you
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
No
,
no
 
do
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
Well
,
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Henry
was
too
much
amused
by
the
interest
he
had
raised
to
be
able
to
carry
it
farther
;
he
could
no
longer
command
solemnity
either
of
subject
or
voice
,
and
was
obliged
to
entreat
her
to
use
her
own
fancy
in
the
perusal
of
Matilda
's
woes
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
recollecting
herself
,
grew
ashamed
of
her
eagerness
,
and
began
earnestly
to
assure
him
that
her
attention
had
been
fixed
without
the
smallest
apprehension
of
really
meeting
with
what
he
related
.

,
she
was
sure
,
would
never
put
her
into
such
a
chamber
as
he
had
described
!
<EOS>
She
was
not
at
all
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
drew
near
the
end
of
their
journey
,
her
impatience
for
a
sight
of
the
abbey
 
for
some
time
suspended
by
his
conversation
on
subjects
very
different
 
returned
in
full
force
,
and
every
bend
in
the
road
was
expected
with
solemn
awe
to
afford
a
glimpse
of
its
massy
walls
of
grey
stone
,
rising
amidst
a
grove
of
ancient
oaks
,
with
the
last
beams
of
the
sun
playing
in
beautiful
splendour
on
its
high
Gothic
windows
.
<EOS>
But
so
low
did
the
building
stand
,
that
she
found
herself
passing
through
the
great
gates
of
the
lodge
into
the
very
grounds
of
Northanger
,
without
having
discerned
even
an
antique
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
not
that
she
had
any
right
to
be
surprised
,
but
there
was
a
something
in
this
mode
of
approach
which
she
certainly
had
not
expected
.
<EOS>
To
pass
between
lodges
of
a
modern
appearance
,
to
find
herself
with
such
ease
in
the
very
precincts
of
the
abbey
,
and
driven
so
rapidly
along
a
smooth
,
level
road
of
fine
gravel
,
without
obstacle
,
alarm
,
or
solemnity
of
any
kind
,
struck
her
as
odd
and
inconsistent
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
long
at
leisure
,
however
,
for
such
considerations
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
scud
of
rain
,
driving
full
in
her
face
,
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
observe
anything
further
,
and
fixed
all
her
thoughts
on
the
welfare
of
her
new
straw
bonnet
;
and
she
was
actually
under
the
abbey
walls
,
was
springing
,
with
Henry
's
assistance
,
from
the
carriage
,
was
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
old
porch
,
and
had
even
passed
on
to
the
hall
,
where
her
friend
and
the
general
were
waiting
to
welcome
her
,
without
feeling
one
awful
foreboding
of
future
misery
to
herself
,
or
one
moment
's
suspicion
of
any
past
scenes
of
horror
being
acted
within
the
solemn
edifice
.
<EOS>
The
breeze
had
not
seemed
to
waft
the
sighs
of
the
murdered
to
her
;
it
had
wafted
nothing
worse
than
a
thick
mizzling
rain
;
and
having
given
a
good
shake
to
her
habit
,
she
was
ready
to
be
shown
into
the
common
drawing
-
room
,
and
capable
of
considering
where
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
An
abbey
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
was
delightful
to
be
really
in
an
abbey
!
<EOS>
But
she
doubted
,
as
she
looked
round
the
room
,
whether
anything
within
her
observation
would
have
given
her
the
consciousness
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
was
in
all
the
profusion
and
elegance
of
modern
taste
.
<EOS>
The
fireplace
,
where
she
had
expected
the
ample
width
and
ponderous
carving
of
former
times
,
was
contracted
to
a
Rumford
,
with
slabs
of
plain
though
handsome
marble
,
and
ornaments
over
it
of
the
prettiest
English
china
.
<EOS>
The
windows
,
to
which
she
looked
with
peculiar
dependence
,
from
having
heard
the
general
talk
of
his
preserving
them
in
their
Gothic
form
with
reverential
care
,
were
yet
less
what
her
fancy
had
portrayed
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
pointed
arch
was
preserved
 
<EOS>
the
form
of
them
was
Gothic
 
<EOS>
they
might
be
even
casements
 
but
every
pane
was
so
large
,
so
clear
,
so
light
!
<EOS>
To
an
imagination
which
had
hoped
for
the
smallest
divisions
,
and
the
heaviest
stone
-
work
,
for
painted
glass
,
dirt
,
and
cobwebs
,
the
difference
was
very
distressing
.
  
<EOS>
The
general
,
perceiving
how
her
eye
was
employed
,
began
to
talk
of
the
smallness
of
the
room
and
simplicity
of
the
furniture
,
where
everything
,
being
for
daily
use
,
pretended
only
to
comfort
,
etc
.
;
flattering
himself
,
however
,
that
there
were
some
apartments
in
the
Abbey
not
unworthy
her
notice
 
and
was
proceeding
to
mention
the
costly
gilding
of
one
in
particular
,
when
,
taking
out
his
watch
,
he
stopped
short
to
pronounce
it
with
surprise
within
twenty
minutes
of
five
!
<EOS>
This
seemed
the
word
of
separation
,
and
Catherine
found
herself
hurried
away
by
Miss
Tilney
in
such
a
manner
as
convinced
her
that
the
strictest
punctuality
to
the
family
hours
would
be
expected
at
Northanger
.
  
<EOS>
Returning
through
the
large
and
lofty
hall
,
they
ascended
a
broad
staircase
of
shining
oak
,
which
,
after
many
flights
and
many
landing
-
places
,
brought
them
upon
a
long
,
wide
gallery
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
it
had
a
range
of
doors
,
and
it
was
lighted
on
the
other
by
windows
which
Catherine
had
only
time
to
discover
looked
into
a
quadrangle
,
before
Miss
Tilney
led
the
way
into
a
chamber
,
and
scarcely
staying
to
hope
she
would
find
it
comfortable
,
left
her
with
an
anxious
entreaty
that
she
would
make
as
little
alteration
as
possible
in
her
dress
.
    
<EOS>
A
moment
's
glance
was
enough
to
satisfy
Catherine
that
her
apartment
was
very
unlike
the
one
which
Henry
had
endeavoured
to
alarm
her
by
the
description
of
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
no
means
unreasonably
large
,
and
contained
neither
tapestry
nor
velvet
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
papered
,
the
floor
was
carpeted
;
the
windows
were
neither
less
perfect
nor
more
dim
than
those
of
the
drawing
-
room
below
;
the
furniture
,
though
not
of
the
latest
fashion
,
was
handsome
and
comfortable
,
and
the
air
of
the
room
altogether
far
from
uncheerful
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
instantaneously
at
ease
on
this
point
,
she
resolved
to
lose
no
time
in
particular
examination
of
anything
,
as
she
greatly
dreaded
disobliging
the
general
by
any
delay
.
<EOS>
Her
habit
therefore
was
thrown
off
with
all
possible
haste
,
and
she
was
preparing
to
unpin
the
linen
package
,
which
the
chaise
-
seat
had
conveyed
for
her
immediate
accommodation
,
when
her
eye
suddenly
fell
on
a
large
high
chest
,
standing
back
in
a
deep
recess
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
it
made
her
start
;
and
,
forgetting
everything
else
,
she
stood
gazing
on
it
in
motionless
wonder
,
while
these
thoughts
crossed
her
:
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
strange
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
such
a
sight
as
this
!
<EOS>
An
immense
heavy
chest
!
<EOS>
What
can
it
hold
?
<EOS>
Why
should
it
be
placed
here
?
<EOS>
Pushed
back
too
,
as
if
meant
to
be
out
of
sight
!
<EOS>
I
will
look
into
it
 
cost
me
what
it
may
,
I
will
look
into
it
 
and
directly
too
 
by
daylight
.
<EOS>
If
I
stay
till
evening
my
candle
may
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
advanced
and
examined
it
closely
:
it
was
of
cedar
,
curiously
inlaid
with
some
darker
wood
,
and
raised
,
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
,
on
a
carved
stand
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
The
lock
was
silver
,
though
tarnished
from
age
;
at
each
end
were
the
imperfect
remains
of
handles
also
of
silver
,
broken
perhaps
prematurely
by
some
strange
violence
;
and
,
on
the
centre
of
the
lid
,
was
a
mysterious
cipher
,
in
the
same
metal
.
<EOS>
Catherine
bent
over
it
intently
,
but
without
being
able
to
distinguish
anything
with
certainty
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
in
whatever
direction
she
took
it
,
believe
the
last
letter
to
be
a
T
;
and
yet
that
it
should
be
anything
else
in
that
house
<EOS>
was
a
circumstance
to
raise
no
common
degree
of
astonishment
.
<EOS>
If
not
originally
theirs
,
by
what
strange
events
could
it
have
fallen
into
the
Tilney
family
?
  
<EOS>
Her
fearful
curiosity
was
every
moment
growing
greater
;
and
seizing
,
with
trembling
hands
,
the
hasp
of
the
lock
,
she
resolved
at
all
hazards
to
satisfy
herself
at
least
as
to
its
contents
.
<EOS>
With
difficulty
,
for
something
seemed
to
resist
her
efforts
,
she
raised
the
lid
a
few
inches
;
but
at
that
moment
a
sudden
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
room
made
her
,
starting
,
quit
her
hold
,
and
the
lid
closed
with
alarming
violence
.
<EOS>
This
ill
-
timed
intruder
was
Miss
Tilney
's
maid
,
sent
by
her
mistress
to
be
of
use
to
Miss
Morland
;
and
though
Catherine
immediately
dismissed
her
,
it
recalled
her
to
the
sense
of
what
she
ought
to
be
doing
,
and
forced
her
,
in
spite
of
her
anxious
desire
to
penetrate
this
mystery
,
to
proceed
in
her
dressing
without
further
delay
.
<EOS>
Her
progress
was
not
quick
,
for
her
thoughts
and
her
eyes
<EOS>
were
still
bent
on
the
object
so
well
calculated
to
interest
and
alarm
;
and
though
she
dared
not
waste
a
moment
upon
a
second
attempt
,
she
could
not
remain
many
paces
from
the
chest
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
having
slipped
one
arm
into
her
gown
,
her
toilette
seemed
so
nearly
finished
that
the
impatience
of
her
curiosity
might
safely
be
indulged
.
<EOS>
One
moment
surely
might
be
spared
;
and
,
so
desperate
should
be
the
exertion
of
her
strength
,
that
,
unless
secured
by
supernatural
means
,
the
lid
in
one
moment
should
be
thrown
back
.
<EOS>
With
this
spirit
she
sprang
forward
,
and
her
confidence
did
not
deceive
her
.
<EOS>
Her
resolute
effort
threw
back
the
lid
,
and
gave
to
her
astonished
eyes
the
view
of
a
white
cotton
counterpane
,
properly
folded
,
reposing
at
one
end
of
the
chest
in
undisputed
possession
!
  
<EOS>
She
was
gazing
on
it
with
the
first
blush
of
surprise
when
Miss
Tilney
,
anxious
for
her
friend
's
being
ready
,
entered
the
room
,
and
to
the
rising
shame
of
having
harboured
for
some
minutes
an
absurd
expectation
,
was
then
added
the
shame
of
being
caught
in
so
idle
a
search
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
curious
old
chest
,
is
not
it
?
"
said
Miss
Tilney
,
as
Catherine
hastily
closed
it
and
turned
away
to
the
glass
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
say
how
many
generations
it
has
been
here
.
<EOS>
How
it
came
to
be
first
put
in
this
room
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
had
it
moved
,
because
I
thought
it
might
sometimes
be
of
use
in
holding
hats
and
bonnets
.
<EOS>
The
worst
of
it
is
that
its
weight
makes
it
difficult
to
open
.
<EOS>
In
that
corner
,
however
,
it
is
at
least
out
of
the
way
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
had
no
leisure
for
speech
,
being
at
once
blushing
,
tying
her
gown
,
and
forming
wise
resolutions
with
the
most
violent
dispatch
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
gently
hinted
her
fear
of
being
late
;
and
in
half
a
minute
they
ran
downstairs
together
,
in
an
alarm
not
wholly
unfounded
,
for
General
Tilney
was
pacing
the
drawing
-
room
,
his
watch
in
his
hand
,
and
having
,
on
the
very
instant
of
their
entering
,
pulled
the
bell
with
violence
,
ordered
"
Dinner
to
be
on
table
directly
!
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
trembled
at
the
emphasis
with
which
he
spoke
,
and
sat
pale
and
breathless
,
in
a
most
humble
mood
,
concerned
for
his
children
,
and
detesting
old
chests
;
and
the
general
,
recovering
his
politeness
as
he
looked
at
her
,
spent
the
rest
of
his
time
in
scolding
his
daughter
for
so
foolishly
hurrying
her
fair
friend
,
who
was
absolutely
out
of
breath
from
haste
,
when
there
was
not
the
least
occasion
for
hurry
in
the
world
:
but
Catherine
could
not
at
all
get
over
the
double
distress
of
having
involved
her
friend
in
a
lecture
and
been
a
great
simpleton
herself
,
till
they
were
happily
seated
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
when
the
general
's
complacent
smiles
,
and
a
good
appetite
of
her
own
,
restored
her
to
peace
.
<EOS>
The
dining
-
parlour
was
a
noble
room
,
suitable
in
its
dimensions
to
a
much
larger
drawing
-
room
than
the
one
in
common
use
,
and
fitted
up
in
a
style
of
luxury
and
expense
which
was
almost
lost
on
the
unpractised
eye
of
Catherine
,
who
saw
little
more
than
its
spaciousness
and
the
number
of
their
attendants
.
<EOS>
Of
the
former
,
she
spoke
aloud
her
admiration
;
and
the
general
,
with
a
very
gracious
countenance
,
acknowledged
that
it
was
by
no
means
an
ill
-
sized
room
,
and
further
confessed
that
,
though
as
careless
on
such
subjects
as
most
people
,
he
did
look
upon
a
tolerably
large
eating
-
room
as
one
of
the
necessaries
of
life
;
he
supposed
,
however
,
"
that
she
must
have
been
used
to
much
better
-
sized
apartments
at
Mr.
Allen
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
was
Catherine
's
honest
assurance
;
"
Mr.
Allen
's
dining
-
parlour
was
not
more
than
half
as
large
,
"
and
she
had
never
seen
so
large
a
room
as
this
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
The
general
's
good
humour
increased
.
<EOS>
Why
,
as
he
had
such
rooms
,
he
thought
it
would
be
simple
not
to
make
use
of
them
;
but
,
upon
his
honour
,
he
believed
there
might
be
more
comfort
in
rooms
of
only
half
their
size
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
's
house
,
he
was
sure
,
must
be
exactly
of
the
true
size
for
rational
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
passed
without
any
further
disturbance
,
and
,
in
the
occasional
absence
of
General
Tilney
,
with
much
positive
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
in
his
presence
that
Catherine
felt
the
smallest
fatigue
from
her
journey
;
and
even
then
,
even
in
moments
of
languor
or
restraint
,
a
sense
of
general
happiness
preponderated
,
and
she
could
think
of
her
friends
in
Bath
without
one
wish
of
being
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
night
was
stormy
;
the
wind
had
been
rising
at
intervals
the
whole
afternoon
;
and
by
the
time
the
party
broke
up
,
it
blew
and
rained
violently
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
as
she
crossed
the
hall
,
listened
to
the
tempest
with
sensations
of
awe
;
and
,
when
she
heard
it
rage
round
a
corner
of
the
ancient
building
and
close
with
sudden
fury
a
distant
door
,
felt
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
really
in
an
abbey
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
these
were
characteristic
sounds
;
they
brought
to
her
recollection
a
countless
variety
of
dreadful
situations
and
horrid
scenes
,
which
such
buildings
had
witnessed
,
and
such
storms
ushered
in
;
and
most
heartily
did
she
rejoice
in
the
happier
circumstances
attending
her
entrance
within
walls
<EOS>
so
solemn
!
<EOS>
She
had
nothing
to
dread
from
midnight
assassins
or
drunken
gallants
.
<EOS>
Henry
had
certainly
been
only
in
jest
in
what
he
had
told
her
that
morning
.
<EOS>
In
a
house
so
furnished
,
and
so
guarded
,
she
could
have
nothing
to
explore
or
to
suffer
,
and
might
go
to
her
bedroom
as
securely
as
if
it
had
been
her
own
chamber
at
Fullerton
.
<EOS>
Thus
wisely
fortifying
her
mind
,
as
she
proceeded
upstairs
,
she
was
enabled
,
especially
on
perceiving
that
Miss
Tilney
slept
only
two
doors
from
her
,
to
enter
her
room
with
a
tolerably
stout
heart
;
and
her
spirits
were
immediately
assisted
by
the
cheerful
blaze
of
a
wood
fire
.
<EOS>
"
How
much
better
is
this
,
"
said
she
,
as
she
walked
to
the
fender
 
<EOS>
"
how
much
better
to
find
a
fire
ready
lit
,
than
to
have
to
wait
shivering
in
the
cold
till
all
the
family
are
in
bed
,
as
so
many
poor
girls
have
been
obliged
to
do
,
and
then
to
have
a
faithful
old
servant
frightening
one
by
coming
in
with
a
faggot
!
<EOS>
How
glad
I
am
that
Northanger
is
what
it
is
!
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
like
some
other
places
,
I
do
not
know
that
,
in
such
a
night
as
this
,
I
could
have
answered
for
my
courage
:
but
now
,
to
be
sure
,
there
is
nothing
to
alarm
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
window
curtains
seemed
in
motion
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
nothing
but
the
violence
of
the
wind
penetrating
through
the
divisions
of
the
shutters
;
and
she
stepped
boldly
forward
,
carelessly
humming
a
tune
,
to
assure
herself
of
its
being
so
,
peeped
courageously
behind
each
curtain
,
saw
nothing
on
either
low
window
seat
to
scare
her
,
and
on
placing
a
hand
against
the
shutter
,
felt
the
strongest
conviction
of
the
wind
's
force
.
<EOS>
A
glance
at
the
old
chest
,
as
she
turned
away
from
this
examination
,
was
not
without
its
use
;
she
scorned
the
causeless
fears
of
an
idle
fancy
,
and
began
with
a
most
happy
indifference
to
prepare
herself
for
bed
.
<EOS>
"
She
should
take
her
time
;
she
should
not
hurry
herself
;
she
did
not
care
if
she
were
the
last
person
up
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
not
make
up
her
fire
;
that
would
seem
cowardly
,
as
if
she
wished
for
the
protection
of
light
after
she
were
in
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fire
therefore
died
away
,
and
Catherine
,
having
spent
the
best
part
of
an
hour
in
her
arrangements
,
was
beginning
to
think
of
stepping
into
bed
,
when
,
on
giving
a
parting
glance
round
the
room
,
she
was
struck
by
the
appearance
of
a
high
,
old
-
fashioned
black
cabinet
,
which
,
though
in
a
situation
conspicuous
enough
,
had
never
caught
her
notice
before
.
<EOS>
Henry
's
words
,
his
description
of
the
ebony
cabinet
which
was
to
escape
her
observation
at
first
,
immediately
rushed
across
her
;
and
though
there
could
be
nothing
really
in
it
,
there
was
something
whimsical
,
it
was
certainly
a
very
remarkable
coincidence
!
<EOS>
She
took
her
candle
and
looked
closely
at
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
absolutely
ebony
and
gold
;
but
it
was
japan
,
black
and
yellow
japan
of
the
handsomest
kind
;
and
as
she
held
her
candle
,
the
yellow
had
very
much
the
effect
of
gold
.
<EOS>
The
key
was
in
the
door
,
and
she
had
a
strange
fancy
to
look
into
it
;
not
,
however
,
with
the
smallest
expectation
of
finding
anything
,
but
it
was
so
very
odd
,
after
what
Henry
had
said
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
she
could
not
sleep
till
she
had
examined
it
.
<EOS>
So
,
placing
the
candle
with
great
caution
on
a
chair
,
she
seized
the
key
with
a
very
tremulous
hand
and
tried
to
turn
it
;
but
it
resisted
her
utmost
strength
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
,
but
not
discouraged
,
she
tried
it
another
way
;
a
bolt
flew
,
and
she
believed
herself
successful
;
but
how
strangely
mysterious
!
<EOS>
The
door
was
still
immovable
.
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
in
breathless
wonder
.
<EOS>
The
wind
roared
down
the
chimney
,
the
rain
beat
in
torrents
against
the
windows
,
and
everything
seemed
to
speak
the
awfulness
of
her
situation
.
<EOS>
To
retire
to
bed
,
however
,
unsatisfied
on
such
a
point
,
would
be
vain
,
since
sleep
must
be
impossible
with
the
consciousness
of
a
cabinet
so
mysteriously
closed
in
her
immediate
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Again
,
therefore
,
she
applied
herself
to
the
key
,
and
after
moving
it
in
every
possible
way
for
some
instants
with
the
determined
celerity
of
hope
's
last
effort
,
the
door
suddenly
yielded
to
her
hand
:
her
heart
leaped
with
exultation
at
such
a
victory
,
and
having
thrown
open
each
folding
door
,
the
second
being
secured
only
by
bolts
of
less
wonderful
construction
than
the
lock
,
though
in
that
her
eye
could
not
discern
anything
unusual
,
a
double
range
of
small
drawers
appeared
in
view
,
with
some
larger
drawers
above
and
below
them
;
and
in
the
centre
,
a
small
door
,
closed
also
with
a
lock
and
key
,
secured
in
all
probability
a
cavity
of
importance
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
heart
beat
quick
,
but
her
courage
did
not
fail
her
.
<EOS>
With
a
cheek
flushed
by
hope
,
and
an
eye
straining
with
curiosity
,
her
fingers
grasped
the
handle
of
a
drawer
and
drew
it
forth
.
<EOS>
It
was
entirely
empty
.
<EOS>
With
less
alarm
and
greater
eagerness
she
seized
a
second
,
a
third
,
a
fourth
;
each
was
equally
empty
.
<EOS>
Not
one
was
left
unsearched
,
and
in
not
one
was
anything
found
.
<EOS>
Well
read
in
the
art
of
concealing
a
treasure
,
the
possibility
of
false
linings
to
the
drawers
did
not
escape
her
,
and
she
felt
round
each
with
anxious
acuteness
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
place
in
the
middle
alone
remained
now
unexplored
;
and
though
she
had
"
never
from
the
first
had
the
smallest
idea
of
finding
anything
in
any
part
of
the
cabinet
,
and
was
not
in
the
least
disappointed
at
her
ill
success
thus
far
,
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
examine
it
thoroughly
while
she
was
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
some
time
however
before
she
could
unfasten
the
door
,
the
same
difficulty
occurring
in
the
management
of
this
inner
lock
as
of
the
outer
;
but
at
length
it
did
open
;
and
not
vain
,
as
hitherto
,
was
her
search
;
her
quick
eyes
directly
fell
on
a
roll
of
paper
pushed
back
into
the
further
part
of
the
cavity
,
apparently
for
concealment
,
and
her
feelings
at
that
moment
were
indescribable
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
fluttered
,
her
knees
trembled
,
and
her
cheeks
grew
pale
.
<EOS>
She
seized
,
with
an
unsteady
hand
,
the
precious
manuscript
,
for
half
a
glance
sufficed
to
ascertain
written
characters
;
and
while
she
acknowledged
with
awful
sensations
this
striking
exemplification
of
what
Henry
had
foretold
,
resolved
instantly
to
peruse
every
line
before
she
attempted
to
rest
.
  
<EOS>
The
dimness
of
the
light
her
candle
emitted
made
her
turn
to
it
with
alarm
;
but
there
was
no
danger
of
its
sudden
extinction
;
it
had
yet
some
hours
to
burn
;
and
that
she
might
not
have
any
greater
difficulty
in
distinguishing
the
writing
than
what
its
ancient
date
might
occasion
<EOS>
,
she
hastily
snuffed
it
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
It
was
snuffed
and
extinguished
in
one
.
<EOS>
A
lamp
could
not
have
expired
with
more
awful
effect
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
for
a
few
moments
,
was
motionless
with
horror
.
<EOS>
It
was
done
completely
;
not
a
remnant
of
light
in
the
wick
could
give
hope
to
the
rekindling
breath
.
<EOS>
Darkness
impenetrable
and
immovable
filled
the
room
.
<EOS>
A
violent
gust
of
wind
,
rising
with
sudden
fury
,
added
fresh
horror
to
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Catherine
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
In
the
pause
which
succeeded
,
a
sound
like
receding
footsteps
and
the
closing
of
a
distant
door
struck
on
her
affrighted
ear
.
<EOS>
Human
nature
could
support
no
more
.
<EOS>
A
cold
sweat
stood
on
her
forehead
,
the
manuscript
fell
from
her
hand
,
and
groping
her
way
to
the
bed
,
she
jumped
hastily
in
,
and
sought
some
suspension
of
agony
by
creeping
far
underneath
the
clothes
.
<EOS>
To
close
her
eyes
in
sleep
that
night
,
she
felt
must
be
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
With
a
curiosity
so
justly
awakened
,
and
feelings
in
every
way
<EOS>
so
agitated
,
repose
must
be
absolutely
impossible
.
<EOS>
The
storm
too
abroad
so
dreadful
!
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
used
to
feel
alarm
from
wind
,
but
now
every
blast
seemed
fraught
with
awful
intelligence
.
<EOS>
The
manuscript
so
wonderfully
found
,
so
wonderfully
accomplishing
the
morning
's
prediction
,
how
was
it
to
be
accounted
for
?
<EOS>
What
could
it
contain
?
<EOS>
To
whom
could
it
relate
?
<EOS>
By
what
means
could
it
have
been
so
long
concealed
?
<EOS>
And
how
singularly
strange
that
it
should
fall
to
her
lot
to
discover
it
!
<EOS>
Till
she
had
made
herself
mistress
of
its
contents
,
however
,
she
could
have
neither
repose
nor
comfort
;
and
with
the
sun
's
first
rays
she
was
determined
to
peruse
it
.
<EOS>
But
many
were
the
tedious
hours
which
must
yet
intervene
.
<EOS>
She
shuddered
,
tossed
about
in
her
bed
,
and
envied
every
quiet
sleeper
.
<EOS>
The
storm
still
raged
,
and
various
were
the
noises
,
more
terrific
even
than
the
wind
,
which
struck
at
intervals
on
her
startled
ear
.
<EOS>
The
very
curtains
of
her
bed
seemed
at
one
moment
in
motion
,
and
at
another
the
lock
of
her
door
was
agitated
,
as
if
by
the
attempt
of
somebody
to
enter
.
<EOS>
Hollow
murmurs
seemed
to
creep
along
the
gallery
,
and
more
than
once
her
blood
was
chilled
by
the
sound
of
distant
moans
.
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
passed
away
,
and
the
wearied
Catherine
had
heard
three
proclaimed
by
all
the
clocks
in
the
house
before
the
tempest
subsided
or
she
unknowingly
fell
fast
asleep
.
    
<EOS>
The
housemaid
's
folding
back
her
window
-
shutters
at
eight
o'clock
the
next
day
was
the
sound
which
first
roused
Catherine
;
and
she
opened
her
eyes
,
wondering
that
they
could
ever
have
been
closed
,
on
objects
of
cheerfulness
;
her
fire
was
already
burning
,
and
a
bright
morning
had
succeeded
the
tempest
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Instantaneously
,
with
the
consciousness
of
existence
,
returned
her
recollection
of
the
manuscript
;
and
springing
from
the
bed
in
the
very
moment
of
the
maid
's
going
away
,
she
eagerly
collected
every
scattered
sheet
which
had
burst
from
the
roll
on
its
falling
to
the
ground
,
and
flew
back
to
enjoy
the
luxury
of
their
perusal
on
her
pillow
.
<EOS>
She
now
plainly
saw
that
she
must
not
expect
a
manuscript
of
equal
length
with
the
generality
of
what
she
had
shuddered
over
in
books
,
for
the
roll
,
seeming
to
consist
entirely
of
small
disjointed
sheets
,
was
altogether
but
of
trifling
size
,
and
much
less
than
she
had
supposed
it
to
be
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
Her
greedy
eye
glanced
rapidly
over
a
page
.
<EOS>
She
started
at
its
import
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
,
or
did
not
her
senses
play
her
false
?
<EOS>
An
inventory
of
linen
,
in
coarse
and
modern
characters
,
seemed
all
that
was
before
her
!
<EOS>
If
the
evidence
of
sight
might
be
trusted
,
she
held
a
washing
-
bill
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
seized
another
sheet
,
and
saw
the
same
articles
with
little
variation
;
a
third
,
a
fourth
,
and
a
fifth
presented
nothing
new
.
<EOS>
Shirts
,
stockings
,
cravats
,
and
waistcoats
faced
her
in
each
.
<EOS>
Two
others
,
penned
by
the
same
hand
,
marked
an
expenditure
scarcely
more
interesting
,
in
letters
,
hair
-
powder
,
shoe
-
string
,
and
breeches
-
ball
.
<EOS>
And
the
larger
sheet
,
which
had
enclosed
the
rest
,
seemed
by
its
first
cramp
line
,
"
To
poultice
chestnut
mare
"
 
a
farrier
's
bill
!
<EOS>
Such
was
the
collection
of
papers
(
left
perhaps
,
as
she
could
then
suppose
,
by
the
negligence
of
a
servant
in
the
place
<EOS>
whence
she
had
taken
them
)
which
had
filled
her
with
expectation
and
alarm
,
and
robbed
her
of
half
her
night
's
rest
!
<EOS>
She
felt
humbled
to
the
dust
.
<EOS>
Could
not
the
adventure
of
the
chest
have
taught
her
wisdom
?
<EOS>
A
corner
of
it
,
catching
her
eye
as
she
lay
,
seemed
to
rise
up
in
judgment
against
her
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
now
be
clearer
than
the
absurdity
of
her
recent
fancies
.
<EOS>
To
suppose
that
a
manuscript
of
many
generations
back
could
have
remained
undiscovered
in
a
room
such
as
that
,
so
modern
,
so
habitable
!
 
<EOS>
Or
that
she
should
be
the
first
to
possess
the
skill
of
unlocking
a
cabinet
,
the
key
of
which
was
open
to
all
!
  
<EOS>
How
could
she
have
so
imposed
on
herself
?
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
that
Henry
Tilney
should
ever
know
her
folly
!
<EOS>
And
it
was
in
a
great
measure
<EOS>
his
own
doing
,
for
had
not
the
cabinet
appeared
so
exactly
to
agree
with
his
description
of
her
adventures
,
she
should
never
have
felt
the
smallest
curiosity
about
it
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
only
comfort
that
occurred
.
<EOS>
Impatient
to
get
rid
of
those
hateful
evidences
of
her
folly
,
those
detestable
papers
then
scattered
over
the
bed
,
she
rose
directly
,
and
folding
them
up
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
same
shape
as
before
,
returned
them
to
the
same
spot
within
the
cabinet
,
with
a
very
hearty
wish
that
no
untoward
accident
might
ever
bring
them
forward
again
,
to
disgrace
her
even
with
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Why
the
locks
should
have
been
so
difficult
to
open
,
however
,
was
still
something
remarkable
,
for
she
could
now
manage
them
with
perfect
ease
.
<EOS>
In
this
there
was
surely
something
mysterious
,
and
she
indulged
in
the
flattering
suggestion
for
half
a
minute
,
till
the
possibility
of
the
door
's
having
been
at
first
unlocked
,
and
of
being
herself
its
fastener
,
darted
into
her
head
,
and
cost
her
another
blush
.
  
<EOS>
She
got
away
as
soon
as
she
could
from
a
room
in
which
her
conduct
produced
such
unpleasant
reflections
,
and
found
her
way
with
all
speed
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
as
it
had
been
pointed
out
to
her
by
Miss
Tilney
the
evening
before
.
<EOS>
Henry
was
alone
in
it
;
and
his
immediate
hope
of
her
having
been
undisturbed
by
the
tempest
,
with
an
arch
reference
to
the
character
of
the
building
they
inhabited
,
was
rather
distressing
.
<EOS>
For
the
world
would
she
not
have
her
weakness
suspected
,
and
yet
,
unequal
to
an
absolute
falsehood
,
was
constrained
to
acknowledge
that
the
wind
had
kept
her
awake
a
little
.
"
<EOS>
But
we
have
a
charming
morning
after
it
,
"
she
added
,
desiring
to
get
rid
of
the
subject
;
"
and
storms
and
sleeplessness
are
nothing
when
they
are
over
.
<EOS>
What
beautiful
hyacinths
!
<EOS>
I
have
just
learnt
to
love
a
hyacinth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
might
you
learn
?
<EOS>
By
accident
or
argument
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
taught
me
;
I
can
not
tell
how
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Allen
used
to
take
pains
,
year
after
year
,
to
make
me
like
them
;
but
I
never
could
,
till
I
saw
them
the
other
day
in
Milsom
Street
;
I
am
naturally
indifferent
about
flowers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
now
you
love
a
hyacinth
.
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
You
have
gained
a
new
source
of
enjoyment
,
and
it
is
well
to
have
as
many
holds
upon
happiness
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
a
taste
for
flowers
is
always
desirable
in
your
sex
,
as
a
means
of
getting
you
out
of
doors
,
and
tempting
you
to
more
frequent
exercise
than
you
would
otherwise
take
.
<EOS>
And
though
the
love
of
a
hyacinth
may
be
rather
domestic
,
who
can
tell
,
the
sentiment
once
raised
,
but
you
may
in
time
come
to
love
a
rose
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
want
any
such
pursuit
to
get
me
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
The
pleasure
of
walking
and
breathing
fresh
air
is
enough
for
me
,
and
in
fine
weather
I
am
out
more
than
half
my
time
.
<EOS>
Mamma
says
I
am
never
within
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
however
,
I
am
pleased
that
you
have
learnt
to
love
a
hyacinth
.
<EOS>
The
mere
habit
of
learning
to
love
is
the
thing
;
and
a
teachableness
of
disposition
in
a
young
lady
is
a
great
blessing
.
<EOS>
Has
my
sister
a
pleasant
mode
of
instruction
?
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
was
saved
the
embarrassment
of
attempting
an
answer
by
the
entrance
of
the
general
,
whose
smiling
compliments
announced
a
happy
state
of
mind
,
but
whose
gentle
hint
of
sympathetic
early
rising
did
not
advance
her
composure
.
  
<EOS>
The
elegance
of
the
breakfast
set
forced
itself
on
Catherine
's
notice
when
they
were
seated
at
table
;
and
,
lucidly
,
it
had
been
the
general
's
choice
.
<EOS>
He
was
enchanted
by
her
approbation
of
his
taste
,
confessed
it
to
be
neat
and
simple
,
thought
it
right
to
encourage
the
manufacture
of
his
country
;
and
for
his
part
,
to
his
uncritical
palate
,
the
tea
was
as
well
flavoured
from
the
clay
of
Staffordshire
,
as
from
that
of
Dresden
or
Save
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
quite
an
old
set
,
purchased
two
years
ago
.
<EOS>
The
manufacture
was
much
improved
since
that
time
;
he
had
seen
some
beautiful
specimens
when
last
in
town
,
and
had
he
not
been
perfectly
without
vanity
of
that
kind
,
might
have
been
tempted
to
order
a
new
set
.
<EOS>
He
trusted
,
however
,
that
an
opportunity
might
ere
long
occur
of
selecting
one
 
though
not
for
himself
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
probably
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
did
not
understand
him
.
  
<EOS>
Shortly
after
breakfast
Henry
left
them
for
Woodston
,
where
business
required
and
would
keep
him
two
or
three
days
.
<EOS>
They
all
attended
in
the
hall
to
see
him
mount
his
horse
,
and
immediately
on
re
-
entering
the
breakfast
-
room
,
Catherine
walked
to
a
window
in
the
hope
of
catching
another
glimpse
of
his
figure
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
somewhat
heavy
call
upon
your
brother
's
fortitude
,
"
observed
the
general
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
Woodston
will
make
but
a
sombre
appearance
today
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
pretty
place
?
"
asked
Catherine
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
say
you
,
Eleanor
?
<EOS>
Speak
your
opinion
,
for
ladies
can
best
tell
the
taste
of
ladies
in
regard
to
places
as
well
as
men
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
acknowledged
by
the
most
impartial
eye
to
have
many
recommendations
.
<EOS>
The
house
stands
among
fine
meadows
facing
the
south
-
east
,
with
an
excellent
kitchen
-
garden
in
the
same
aspect
;
the
walls
surrounding
which
I
built
and
stocked
myself
about
ten
years
ago
,
for
the
benefit
of
my
son
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
family
living
,
Miss
Morland
;
and
the
property
in
the
place
being
chiefly
my
own
,
you
may
believe
I
take
care
that
it
shall
not
be
a
bad
one
.
<EOS>
Did
Henry
's
income
depend
solely
on
this
living
,
he
would
not
be
ill
-
provided
for
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
may
seem
odd
,
that
with
only
two
younger
children
,
I
should
think
any
profession
necessary
for
him
;
and
certainly
there
are
moments
when
we
could
all
wish
him
disengaged
from
every
tie
of
business
.
<EOS>
But
though
I
may
not
exactly
make
converts
of
you
young
ladies
,
I
am
sure
your
father
,
Miss
Morland
,
would
agree
with
me
in
thinking
it
expedient
to
give
every
young
man
some
employment
.
<EOS>
The
money
is
nothing
,
it
is
not
an
object
,
but
employment
is
the
thing
.
<EOS>
Even
Frederick
,
my
eldest
son
,
you
see
,
who
will
perhaps
inherit
as
considerable
a
landed
property
as
any
private
man
in
the
county
,
has
his
profession
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
imposing
effect
of
this
last
argument
was
equal
to
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
The
silence
of
the
lady
proved
it
to
be
unanswerable
.
  
<EOS>
Something
had
been
said
the
evening
before
of
her
being
shown
over
the
house
,
and
he
now
offered
himself
as
her
conductor
;
and
though
Catherine
had
hoped
to
explore
it
accompanied
only
by
his
daughter
,
it
was
a
proposal
of
too
much
happiness
in
itself
,
under
any
circumstances
,
not
to
be
gladly
accepted
;
for
she
had
been
already
eighteen
hours
in
the
abbey
,
and
had
seen
only
a
few
of
its
rooms
.
<EOS>
The
netting
-
box
,
just
leisurely
drawn
forth
,
was
closed
with
joyful
haste
,
and
she
was
ready
to
attend
him
in
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
they
had
gone
over
the
house
,
he
promised
himself
moreover
the
pleasure
of
accompanying
her
into
the
shrubberies
and
garden
.
"
<EOS>
She
curtsied
her
acquiescence
.
"
<EOS>
But
perhaps
it
might
be
more
agreeable
to
her
to
make
those
her
first
object
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
at
present
favourable
,
and
at
this
time
of
year
the
uncertainty
was
very
great
of
its
continuing
so
.
<EOS>
Which
would
she
prefer
?
<EOS>
He
was
equally
at
her
service
.
<EOS>
Which
did
his
daughter
think
would
most
accord
with
her
fair
friend
's
wishes
?
<EOS>
But
he
thought
he
could
discern
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
certainly
read
in
Miss
Morland
's
eyes
a
judicious
desire
of
making
use
of
the
present
smiling
weather
.
<EOS>
But
when
did
she
judge
amiss
?
<EOS>
The
abbey
would
be
always
safe
and
dry
.
<EOS>
He
yielded
implicitly
,
and
would
fetch
his
hat
and
attend
them
in
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
He
left
the
room
,
and
Catherine
,
with
a
disappointed
,
anxious
face
,
began
to
speak
of
her
unwillingness
that
he
should
be
taking
them
out
of
doors
against
his
own
inclination
,
under
a
mistaken
idea
of
pleasing
her
;
but
she
was
stopped
by
Miss
Tilney
's
saying
,
with
a
little
confusion
,
"
I
believe
it
will
be
wisest
to
take
the
morning
while
it
is
so
fine
;
and
do
not
be
uneasy
on
my
father
's
account
;
he
always
walks
out
at
this
time
of
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
did
not
exactly
know
how
this
was
to
be
understood
.
<EOS>
Why
was
Miss
Tilney
embarrassed
?
<EOS>
Could
there
be
any
unwillingness
on
the
general
's
side
to
show
her
over
the
abbey
?
<EOS>
The
proposal
was
his
own
.
<EOS>
And
was
not
it
odd
that
he
should
always
take
his
walk
so
early
?
<EOS>
Neither
her
father
nor
Mr.
Allen
did
so
.
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
very
provoking
.
<EOS>
She
was
all
impatience
to
see
the
house
,
and
had
scarcely
any
curiosity
about
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
If
Henry
had
been
with
them
indeed
!
<EOS>
But
now
she
should
not
know
what
was
picturesque
when
she
saw
it
.
<EOS>
Such
were
her
thoughts
,
but
she
kept
them
to
herself
,
and
put
on
her
bonnet
in
patient
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
struck
,
however
,
beyond
her
expectation
,
by
the
grandeur
of
the
abbey
,
as
she
saw
it
for
the
first
time
from
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
The
whole
building
enclosed
a
large
court
;
and
two
sides
of
the
quadrangle
,
rich
in
Gothic
ornaments
,
stood
forward
for
admiration
.
<EOS>
The
remainder
was
shut
off
by
knolls
of
old
trees
,
or
luxuriant
plantations
,
and
the
steep
woody
hills
rising
behind
,
to
give
it
shelter
,
were
beautiful
even
in
the
leafless
month
of
March
.
<EOS>
Catherine
had
seen
nothing
to
compare
with
it
;
and
her
feelings
of
delight
were
so
strong
,
that
without
waiting
for
any
better
authority
,
she
boldly
burst
forth
in
wonder
and
praise
.
<EOS>
The
general
listened
with
assenting
gratitude
;
and
it
seemed
as
if
his
own
estimation
of
Northanger
had
waited
unfixed
till
that
hour
.
  
<EOS>
The
kitchen
-
garden
was
to
be
next
admired
,
and
he
led
the
way
to
it
across
a
small
portion
of
the
park
.
  
<EOS>
The
number
of
acres
contained
in
this
garden
was
such
as
Catherine
could
not
listen
to
without
dismay
,
being
more
than
double
the
extent
of
all
Mr.
Allen
's
,
as
well
as
her
father
's
,
including
church
-
yard
and
orchard
.
<EOS>
The
walls
seemed
countless
in
number
,
endless
in
length
;
a
village
of
hot
-
houses
seemed
to
arise
among
them
,
and
a
whole
parish
to
be
at
work
within
the
enclosure
.
<EOS>
The
general
was
flattered
by
her
looks
of
surprise
,
which
told
him
almost
as
plainly
,
as
he
soon
forced
her
to
tell
him
in
words
,
that
she
had
never
seen
any
gardens
at
all
equal
to
them
before
;
and
he
then
modestly
owned
that
,
"
without
any
ambition
of
that
sort
himself
 
without
any
solicitude
about
it
 
<EOS>
he
did
believe
them
to
be
unrivalled
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
a
hobby
-
horse
,
it
was
that
.
<EOS>
He
loved
a
garden
.
<EOS>
Though
careless
enough
in
most
matters
of
eating
,
he
loved
good
fruit
 
<EOS>
or
if
he
did
not
,
his
friends
and
children
did
.
<EOS>
There
were
great
vexations
,
however
,
attending
such
a
garden
as
his
.
<EOS>
The
utmost
care
could
not
always
secure
the
most
valuable
fruits
.
<EOS>
The
pinery
had
yielded
only
one
hundred
in
the
last
year
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
,
he
supposed
,
must
feel
these
inconveniences
as
well
as
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
did
not
care
about
the
garden
,
and
never
went
into
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
triumphant
smile
of
self
-
satisfaction
,
the
general
wished
he
could
do
the
same
,
for
he
never
entered
his
,
without
being
vexed
in
some
way
or
other
,
by
its
falling
short
of
his
plan
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
were
Mr.
Allen
's
succession
-
houses
worked
?
"
describing
the
nature
of
his
own
as
they
entered
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Allen
had
only
one
small
hot
-
house
,
which
Mrs.
Allen
had
the
use
of
for
her
plants
in
winter
,
and
there
was
a
fire
in
it
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
happy
man
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
general
,
with
a
look
of
very
happy
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
Having
taken
her
into
every
division
,
and
led
her
under
every
wall
,
till
she
was
heartily
weary
of
seeing
and
wondering
,
he
suffered
the
girls
at
last
to
seize
the
advantage
of
an
outer
door
,
and
then
expressing
his
wish
to
examine
the
effect
of
some
recent
alterations
about
the
tea
-
house
,
proposed
it
as
no
unpleasant
extension
of
their
walk
,
if
Miss
Morland
were
not
tired
.
"
<EOS>
But
where
are
you
going
,
Eleanor
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
choose
that
cold
,
damp
path
to
it
?
<EOS>
Miss
Morland
will
get
wet
.
<EOS>
Our
best
way
is
across
the
park
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
so
favourite
a
walk
of
mine
,
"
said
Miss
Tilney
,
"
that
I
always
think
it
the
best
and
nearest
way
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
it
may
be
damp
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
narrow
winding
path
through
a
thick
grove
of
old
Scotch
firs
;
and
Catherine
,
struck
by
its
gloomy
aspect
,
and
eager
to
enter
it
,
could
not
,
even
by
the
general
's
disapprobation
,
be
kept
from
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
He
perceived
her
inclination
,
and
having
again
urged
the
plea
of
health
in
vain
,
was
too
polite
to
make
further
opposition
.
<EOS>
He
excused
himself
,
however
,
from
attending
them
:
"
The
rays
of
the
sun
were
not
too
cheerful
for
him
,
and
he
would
meet
them
by
another
course
.
"
<EOS>
He
turned
away
;
and
Catherine
was
shocked
to
find
how
much
her
spirits
were
relieved
by
the
separation
.
<EOS>
The
shock
,
however
,
being
less
real
than
the
relief
,
offered
it
no
injury
;
and
she
began
to
talk
with
easy
gaiety
of
the
delightful
melancholy
which
such
a
grove
inspired
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
particularly
fond
of
this
spot
,
"
said
her
companion
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
mother
's
favourite
walk
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
had
never
heard
Mrs.
Tilney
mentioned
in
the
family
before
,
and
the
interest
excited
by
this
tender
remembrance
showed
itself
directly
in
her
altered
countenance
,
and
in
the
attentive
pause
with
which
she
waited
for
something
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
walk
here
so
often
with
her
!
"
<EOS>
added
Eleanor
;
"
though
I
never
loved
it
then
,
as
I
have
loved
it
since
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
indeed
I
used
to
wonder
at
her
choice
.
<EOS>
But
her
memory
endears
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
ought
it
not
,
"
reflected
Catherine
,
"
to
endear
it
to
her
husband
?
<EOS>
Yet
the
general
would
not
enter
it
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
continuing
silent
,
she
ventured
to
say
,
"
Her
death
must
have
been
a
great
affliction
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
and
increasing
one
,
"
replied
the
other
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
thirteen
when
it
happened
;
and
though
I
felt
my
loss
perhaps
as
strongly
as
one
so
young
could
feel
it
,
I
did
not
,
I
could
not
,
then
know
what
a
loss
it
was
.
"
<EOS>
She
stopped
for
a
moment
,
and
then
added
,
with
great
firmness
,
"
I
have
no
sister
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
and
though
Henry
 
though
my
brothers
are
very
affectionate
,
and
Henry
is
a
great
deal
here
,
which
I
am
most
thankful
for
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
not
to
be
often
solitary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
you
must
miss
him
very
much
.
"
  
"
A
mother
would
have
been
always
present
.
<EOS>
A
mother
would
have
been
a
constant
friend
;
her
influence
would
have
been
beyond
all
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
she
a
very
charming
woman
?
<EOS>
Was
she
handsome
?
<EOS>
Was
there
any
picture
of
her
in
the
abbey
?
<EOS>
And
why
had
she
been
so
partial
to
that
grove
?
<EOS>
Was
it
from
dejection
of
spirits
?
<EOS>
"
 
were
questions
now
eagerly
poured
forth
;
the
first
three
received
a
ready
affirmative
,
the
two
others
were
passed
by
;
and
Catherine
's
interest
in
the
deceased
Mrs.
Tilney
augmented
with
every
question
,
whether
answered
or
not
.
<EOS>
Of
her
unhappiness
in
marriage
,
she
felt
persuaded
.
<EOS>
The
general
certainly
had
been
an
unkind
husband
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
love
her
walk
:
could
he
therefore
have
loved
her
?
<EOS>
And
besides
,
handsome
as
he
was
,
there
was
a
something
in
the
turn
of
his
features
which
spoke
his
not
having
behaved
well
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
picture
,
I
suppose
,
"
blushing
at
the
consummate
art
of
her
own
question
,
"
hangs
in
your
father
's
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
it
was
intended
for
the
drawing
-
room
;
but
my
father
was
dissatisfied
with
the
painting
,
and
for
some
time
it
had
no
place
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
her
death
I
obtained
it
for
my
own
,
and
hung
it
in
my
bed
-
chamber
 
where
I
shall
be
happy
to
show
it
you
;
it
is
very
like
.
"
<EOS>
Here
was
another
proof
.
<EOS>
A
portrait
 
very
like
 
of
a
departed
wife
,
not
valued
by
the
husband
!
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
dreadfully
cruel
to
her
!
  
<EOS>
Catherine
attempted
no
longer
to
hide
from
herself
the
nature
of
the
feelings
which
,
in
spite
of
all
his
attentions
,
he
had
previously
excited
;
and
what
had
been
terror
and
dislike
before
,
was
now
absolute
aversion
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
aversion
!
<EOS>
His
cruelty
to
such
a
charming
woman
made
him
odious
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
often
read
of
such
characters
,
characters
which
Mr.
Allen
had
been
used
to
call
unnatural
and
overdrawn
;
but
here
was
proof
positive
of
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
just
settled
this
point
when
the
end
of
the
path
brought
them
directly
upon
the
general
;
and
in
spite
of
all
her
virtuous
indignation
,
she
found
herself
again
obliged
to
walk
with
him
,
listen
to
him
,
and
even
to
smile
when
he
smiled
.
<EOS>
Being
no
longer
able
,
however
,
to
receive
pleasure
from
the
surrounding
objects
,
she
soon
began
to
walk
with
lassitude
;
the
general
perceived
it
,
and
with
a
concern
for
her
health
,
which
seemed
to
reproach
her
for
her
opinion
of
him
,
was
most
urgent
for
returning
with
his
daughter
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
would
follow
them
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Again
they
parted
 
but
Eleanor
was
called
back
in
half
a
minute
to
receive
a
strict
charge
against
taking
her
friend
<EOS>
round
the
abbey
till
his
return
.
<EOS>
This
second
instance
of
his
anxiety
to
delay
what
she
so
much
wished
for
struck
Catherine
as
very
remarkable
.
    
<EOS>
An
hour
passed
away
before
the
general
came
in
,
spent
,
on
the
part
of
his
young
guest
,
in
no
very
favourable
consideration
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
lengthened
absence
,
these
solitary
rambles
,
did
not
speak
a
mind
at
ease
,
or
a
conscience
void
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
At
length
he
appeared
;
and
,
whatever
might
have
been
the
gloom
of
his
meditations
,
he
could
still
smile
with
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
,
understanding
in
part
her
friend
's
curiosity
to
see
the
house
,
soon
revived
the
subject
;
and
her
father
being
,
contrary
to
Catherine
's
expectations
,
unprovided
with
any
pretence
for
further
delay
,
beyond
that
of
stopping
five
minutes
to
order
refreshments
to
be
in
the
room
by
their
return
,
was
at
last
ready
to
escort
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
set
forward
;
and
,
with
a
grandeur
of
air
,
a
dignified
step
,
which
caught
the
eye
,
but
could
not
shake
the
doubts
of
the
well
-
read
Catherine
,
he
led
the
way
across
the
hall
,
through
the
common
drawing
-
room
and
one
useless
antechamber
,
into
a
room
magnificent
both
in
size
and
furniture
 
<EOS>
the
real
drawing
-
room
,
used
only
with
company
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
noble
 
<EOS>
very
grand
 
<EOS>
very
charming
!
 
<EOS>
was
all
that
Catherine
had
to
say
,
for
her
indiscriminating
eye
scarcely
discerned
the
colour
of
the
satin
;
and
all
minuteness
of
praise
,
all
praise
that
had
much
meaning
,
was
supplied
by
the
general
:
the
costliness
or
elegance
of
any
room
's
fitting
-
up
could
be
nothing
to
her
;
she
cared
for
no
furniture
of
a
more
modern
date
than
the
fifteenth
century
.
<EOS>
When
the
general
had
satisfied
his
own
curiosity
,
in
a
close
examination
of
every
well
-
known
ornament
,
they
proceeded
into
the
library
,
an
apartment
,
in
its
way
,
of
equal
magnificence
,
exhibiting
a
collection
of
books
,
on
which
an
humble
man
might
have
looked
with
pride
.
<EOS>
Catherine
heard
,
admired
,
and
wondered
with
more
genuine
feeling
than
before
 
gathered
all
that
she
could
from
this
storehouse
of
knowledge
,
by
running
over
the
titles
of
half
a
shelf
,
and
was
ready
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
But
suites
of
apartments
did
not
spring
up
with
her
wishes
.
<EOS>
Large
as
was
the
building
,
she
had
already
visited
the
greatest
part
;
though
,
on
being
told
that
,
with
the
addition
of
the
kitchen
,
the
six
or
seven
rooms
she
had
now
seen
surrounded
three
sides
of
the
court
,
she
could
scarcely
believe
it
,
or
overcome
the
suspicion
of
there
being
many
chambers
secreted
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
relief
,
however
,
that
they
were
to
return
to
the
rooms
in
common
use
,
by
passing
through
a
few
of
less
importance
,
looking
into
the
court
,
which
,
with
occasional
passages
,
not
wholly
unintricate
,
connected
the
different
sides
;
and
she
was
further
soothed
in
her
progress
by
being
told
that
she
was
treading
what
had
once
been
a
cloister
,
having
traces
of
cells
pointed
out
,
and
observing
several
doors
that
were
neither
opened
nor
explained
to
her
 
by
finding
herself
successively
in
a
billiard
-
room
,
and
in
the
general
's
private
apartment
,
without
comprehending
their
connection
,
or
being
able
to
turn
aright
when
she
left
them
;
and
lastly
,
by
passing
through
a
dark
little
room
,
owning
Henry
's
authority
,
and
strewed
with
his
litter
of
books
,
guns
,
and
greatcoats
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
dining
-
room
,
of
which
,
though
already
seen
,
and
always
to
be
seen
at
five
o'clock
,
the
general
could
not
forgo
the
pleasure
of
pacing
out
the
length
,
for
the
more
certain
information
of
Miss
Morland
,
as
to
what
she
neither
doubted
nor
cared
for
,
they
proceeded
by
quick
communication
to
the
kitchen
 
<EOS>
the
ancient
kitchen
of
the
convent
,
rich
in
the
massy
walls
and
smoke
of
former
days
,
and
in
the
stoves
and
hot
closets
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
The
general
's
improving
hand
had
not
loitered
here
:
every
modern
invention
to
facilitate
the
labour
of
the
cooks
had
been
adopted
within
this
,
their
spacious
theatre
;
and
,
when
the
genius
of
others
had
failed
,
his
own
had
often
produced
the
perfection
wanted
.
<EOS>
His
endowments
of
this
spot
alone
might
at
any
time
have
placed
him
high
among
the
benefactors
of
the
convent
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
walls
of
the
kitchen
ended
all
the
antiquity
of
the
abbey
;
the
fourth
side
of
the
quadrangle
having
,
on
account
of
its
decaying
state
,
been
removed
by
the
general
's
father
,
and
the
present
erected
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
All
that
was
venerable
ceased
here
.
<EOS>
The
new
building
was
not
only
new
,
but
declared
itself
to
be
so
;
intended
only
for
offices
,
and
enclosed
behind
by
stable
-
yards
,
no
uniformity
of
architecture
had
been
thought
necessary
.
<EOS>
Catherine
could
have
raved
at
the
hand
which
had
swept
away
what
must
have
been
beyond
the
value
of
all
the
rest
,
for
the
purposes
of
mere
domestic
economy
;
and
would
willingly
have
been
spared
the
mortification
of
a
walk
through
scenes
so
fallen
,
had
the
general
allowed
it
;
but
if
he
had
a
vanity
,
it
was
in
the
arrangement
of
his
offices
;
and
as
he
was
convinced
that
,
to
a
mind
like
Miss
Morland
's
,
a
view
of
the
accommodations
and
comforts
,
by
which
the
labours
of
her
inferiors
were
softened
,
must
always
be
gratifying
,
he
should
make
no
apology
for
leading
her
on
.
<EOS>
They
took
a
slight
survey
of
all
;
and
Catherine
was
impressed
,
beyond
her
expectation
,
by
their
multiplicity
and
their
convenience
.
<EOS>
The
purposes
for
which
a
few
shapeless
pantries
and
a
comfortless
scullery
were
deemed
sufficient
at
Fullerton
,
were
here
carried
on
in
appropriate
divisions
,
commodious
and
roomy
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
servants
continually
appearing
did
not
strike
her
less
than
the
number
of
their
offices
.
<EOS>
Wherever
they
went
,
some
pattened
girl
stopped
to
curtsy
,
or
some
footman
in
dishabille
sneaked
off
.
<EOS>
Yet
this
was
an
abbey
!
<EOS>
How
inexpressibly
different
in
these
domestic
arrangements
from
such
as
she
had
read
about
 
from
abbeys
and
castles
,
in
which
,
though
certainly
larger
than
Northanger
,
all
the
dirty
work
of
the
house
was
to
be
done
by
two
pair
of
female
hands
at
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
How
they
could
get
through
it
all
had
often
amazed
Mrs.
Allen
;
and
,
when
Catherine
saw
what
was
necessary
here
,
she
began
to
be
amazed
herself
.
  
<EOS>
They
returned
to
the
hall
,
that
the
chief
staircase
might
be
ascended
,
and
the
beauty
of
its
wood
,
and
ornaments
of
rich
carving
might
be
pointed
out
:
having
gained
the
top
,
they
turned
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
gallery
in
which
her
room
lay
,
and
shortly
entered
one
on
the
same
plan
,
but
superior
in
length
and
breadth
.
<EOS>
She
was
here
shown
successively
into
three
large
bed
-
chambers
,
with
their
dressing
-
rooms
,
most
completely
and
handsomely
fitted
up
;
everything
that
money
and
taste
could
do
,
to
give
comfort
and
elegance
to
apartments
,
had
been
bestowed
on
these
;
and
,
being
furnished
within
the
last
five
years
,
they
were
perfect
in
all
that
would
be
generally
pleasing
,
and
wanting
in
all
that
could
give
pleasure
to
Catherine
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
surveying
the
last
,
the
general
,
after
slightly
naming
a
few
of
the
distinguished
characters
by
whom
they
had
at
times
been
honoured
,
turned
with
a
smiling
countenance
to
Catherine
,
and
ventured
to
hope
that
henceforward
some
of
their
earliest
tenants
might
be
"
our
friends
from
Fullerton
.
"
<EOS>
She
felt
the
unexpected
compliment
,
and
deeply
regretted
the
impossibility
of
thinking
well
of
a
man
so
kindly
disposed
towards
herself
,
and
so
full
of
civility
to
all
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
The
gallery
was
terminated
by
folding
doors
,
which
Miss
Tilney
,
advancing
,
had
thrown
open
,
and
passed
through
,
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
doing
the
same
by
the
first
door
to
the
left
,
in
another
long
reach
of
gallery
,
when
the
general
,
coming
forwards
,
called
her
hastily
,
and
,
as
Catherine
thought
,
rather
angrily
back
,
demanding
whether
she
were
going
?
 
<EOS>
And
what
was
there
more
to
be
seen
?
 
<EOS>
Had
not
Miss
Morland
already
seen
all
that
could
be
worth
her
notice
?
 
<EOS>
And
did
she
not
suppose
her
friend
might
be
glad
of
some
refreshment
after
so
much
exercise
?
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
drew
back
directly
,
and
the
heavy
doors
were
closed
upon
the
mortified
Catherine
,
who
,
having
seen
,
in
a
momentary
glance
beyond
them
,
a
narrower
passage
,
more
numerous
openings
,
and
symptoms
of
a
winding
staircase
,
believed
herself
at
last
within
the
reach
of
something
worth
her
notice
;
and
felt
,
as
she
unwillingly
paced
back
the
gallery
,
that
she
would
rather
be
allowed
to
examine
that
end
of
the
house
than
see
all
the
finery
of
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
The
general
's
evident
desire
of
preventing
such
an
examination
was
an
additional
stimulant
.
<EOS>
Something
was
certainly
to
be
concealed
;
her
fancy
,
though
it
had
trespassed
lately
once
or
twice
,
could
not
mislead
her
here
;
and
what
that
something
was
,
a
short
sentence
of
Miss
Tilney
's
,
as
they
followed
the
general
at
some
distance
downstairs
,
seemed
to
point
out
:
"
I
was
going
to
take
you
into
what
was
my
mother
's
room
 
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
she
died
 
"
were
all
her
words
;
but
few
as
they
were
,
they
conveyed
pages
of
intelligence
to
Catherine
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
wonder
that
the
general
should
shrink
from
the
sight
of
such
objects
as
that
room
must
contain
;
a
room
in
all
probability
never
entered
by
him
since
the
dreadful
scene
had
passed
,
which
released
his
suffering
wife
,
and
left
him
to
the
stings
of
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
She
ventured
,
when
next
alone
with
Eleanor
,
to
express
her
wish
of
being
permitted
to
see
it
,
as
well
as
all
the
rest
of
that
side
of
the
house
;
and
Eleanor
promised
to
attend
her
there
,
whenever
they
should
have
a
convenient
hour
.
<EOS>
Catherine
understood
her
:
the
general
must
be
watched
from
home
,
before
that
room
could
be
entered
.
<EOS>
"
It
remains
as
it
was
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
in
a
tone
of
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
entirely
.
"
  
"
And
how
long
ago
may
it
be
that
your
mother
died
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
dead
these
nine
years
.
"
<EOS>
And
nine
years
,
Catherine
knew
,
was
a
trifle
of
time
,
compared
with
what
generally
elapsed
after
the
death
of
an
injured
wife
,
before
her
room
was
put
to
rights
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
with
her
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
last
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Miss
Tilney
,
sighing
;
"
I
was
unfortunately
from
home
.
<EOS>
Her
illness
was
sudden
and
short
;
and
,
before
I
arrived
it
was
all
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
blood
ran
cold
with
the
horrid
suggestions
which
naturally
sprang
from
these
words
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
?
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
Henry
's
father
 
?
<EOS>
And
yet
how
many
were
the
examples
to
justify
even
the
blackest
suspicions
!
<EOS>
And
,
when
she
saw
him
in
the
evening
,
while
she
worked
with
her
friend
,
slowly
pacing
the
drawing
-
room
for
an
hour
together
in
silent
thoughtfulness
,
with
downcast
eyes
and
contracted
brow
<EOS>
,
she
felt
secure
from
all
possibility
of
wronging
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
air
and
attitude
of
a
Montoni
!
<EOS>
What
could
more
plainly
speak
the
gloomy
workings
of
a
mind
not
wholly
dead
to
every
sense
of
humanity
,
in
its
fearful
review
of
past
scenes
of
guilt
?
<EOS>
Unhappy
man
!
<EOS>
And
the
anxiousness
of
her
spirits
directed
her
eyes
towards
his
figure
so
repeatedly
,
as
to
catch
Miss
Tilney
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
"
she
whispered
,
"
often
walks
about
the
room
in
this
way
;
it
is
nothing
unusual
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
worse
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Catherine
;
such
ill
-
timed
exercise
was
of
a
piece
with
the
strange
unseasonableness
of
his
morning
walks
,
and
boded
nothing
good
.
  
<EOS>
After
an
evening
,
the
little
variety
and
seeming
length
of
which
made
her
peculiarly
sensible
of
Henry
's
importance
among
them
,
she
was
heartily
glad
to
be
dismissed
;
though
it
was
a
look
from
the
general
not
designed
for
her
observation
which
sent
his
daughter
to
the
bell
.
<EOS>
When
the
butler
would
have
lit
his
master
's
candle
,
however
,
he
was
forbidden
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
not
going
to
retire
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
many
pamphlets
to
finish
,
"
said
he
to
Catherine
,
"
before
I
can
close
my
eyes
,
and
perhaps
may
be
poring
over
the
affairs
of
the
nation
for
hours
after
you
are
asleep
.
<EOS>
Can
either
of
us
be
more
meetly
employed
?
<EOS>
My
eyes
will
be
blinding
for
the
good
of
others
,
and
yours
preparing
by
rest
for
future
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
neither
the
business
alleged
,
nor
the
magnificent
compliment
,
could
win
Catherine
from
thinking
that
some
very
different
object
must
occasion
so
serious
a
delay
of
proper
repose
.
<EOS>
To
be
kept
up
for
hours
,
after
the
family
were
in
bed
,
by
stupid
pamphlets
was
not
very
likely
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
some
deeper
cause
:
something
was
to
be
done
which
could
be
done
only
while
the
household
slept
;
and
the
probability
that
Mrs.
Tilney
yet
lived
,
shut
up
for
causes
unknown
,
and
receiving
from
the
pitiless
hands
of
her
husband
a
nightly
supply
of
coarse
food
,
was
the
conclusion
which
necessarily
followed
.
<EOS>
Shocking
as
was
the
idea
,
it
was
at
least
better
than
a
death
unfairly
hastened
,
as
,
in
the
natural
course
of
things
,
she
must
ere
long
be
released
.
<EOS>
The
suddenness
of
her
reputed
illness
,
the
absence
of
her
daughter
,
and
probably
of
her
other
children
,
at
the
time
 
all
favoured
the
supposition
of
her
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
Its
origin
 
jealousy
perhaps
,
or
wanton
cruelty
 
was
yet
to
be
unravelled
.
  
<EOS>
In
revolving
these
matters
,
while
she
undressed
,
it
suddenly
struck
her
as
not
unlikely
that
she
might
that
morning
have
passed
near
the
very
spot
of
this
unfortunate
woman
's
confinement
 
might
have
been
within
a
few
paces
of
the
cell
in
which
she
languished
out
her
days
;
for
what
part
of
the
abbey
could
be
more
fitted
for
the
purpose
than
that
which
yet
bore
the
traces
of
monastic
division
?
<EOS>
In
the
high
-
arched
passage
,
paved
with
stone
,
which
already
she
had
trodden
with
peculiar
awe
,
she
well
remembered
the
doors
of
which
the
general
had
given
no
account
.
<EOS>
To
what
might
not
those
doors
lead
?
<EOS>
In
support
of
the
plausibility
of
this
conjecture
,
it
further
occurred
to
her
that
the
forbidden
gallery
,
in
which
lay
the
apartments
of
the
unfortunate
Mrs.
Tilney
,
must
be
,
as
certainly
as
her
memory
could
guide
her
,
exactly
over
this
suspected
range
of
cells
,
and
the
staircase
by
the
side
of
those
apartments
of
which
she
had
caught
a
transient
glimpse
,
communicating
by
some
secret
means
with
those
cells
,
might
well
have
favoured
the
barbarous
proceedings
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Down
that
staircase
she
had
perhaps
been
conveyed
in
a
state
of
well
-
prepared
insensibility
!
  
<EOS>
Catherine
sometimes
started
at
the
boldness
of
her
own
surmises
,
and
sometimes
hoped
or
feared
that
she
had
gone
too
far
;
but
they
were
supported
by
such
appearances
as
made
their
dismissal
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
The
side
of
the
quadrangle
,
in
which
she
supposed
the
guilty
scene
to
be
acting
,
being
,
according
to
her
belief
,
just
opposite
her
own
,
it
struck
her
that
,
if
judiciously
watched
,
some
rays
of
light
from
the
general
's
lamp
might
glimmer
through
the
lower
windows
,
as
he
passed
to
the
prison
of
his
wife
;
and
,
twice
before
she
stepped
into
bed
,
she
stole
gently
from
her
room
to
the
corresponding
window
in
the
gallery
,
to
see
if
it
appeared
;
but
all
abroad
was
dark
,
and
it
must
yet
be
too
early
.
<EOS>
The
various
ascending
noises
convinced
her
that
the
servants
must
still
be
up
.
<EOS>
Till
midnight
,
she
supposed
it
would
be
in
vain
to
watch
;
but
then
,
when
the
clock
had
struck
twelve
,
and
all
was
quiet
,
she
would
,
if
not
quite
appalled
by
darkness
,
steal
out
and
look
once
more
.
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
twelve
 
<EOS>
and
Catherine
had
been
half
an
hour
asleep
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
day
afforded
no
opportunity
for
the
proposed
examination
of
the
mysterious
apartments
.
<EOS>
It
was
Sunday
,
and
the
whole
time
between
morning
and
afternoon
service
was
required
by
the
general
in
exercise
abroad
or
eating
cold
meat
at
home
;
and
great
as
was
Catherine
's
curiosity
,
her
courage
was
not
equal
to
a
wish
of
exploring
them
after
dinner
,
either
by
the
fading
light
of
the
sky
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
,
or
by
the
yet
more
partial
though
stronger
illumination
of
a
treacherous
lamp
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
unmarked
therefore
by
anything
to
interest
her
imagination
beyond
the
sight
of
a
very
elegant
monument
to
the
memory
of
Mrs.
Tilney
,
which
immediately
fronted
the
family
pew
.
<EOS>
By
that
her
eye
was
instantly
caught
and
long
retained
;
and
the
perusal
of
the
highly
strained
epitaph
,
in
which
every
virtue
was
ascribed
to
her
by
the
inconsolable
husband
,
who
must
have
been
in
some
way
or
other
her
destroyer
,
affected
her
even
to
tears
.
  
<EOS>
That
the
general
,
having
erected
such
a
monument
,
should
be
able
to
face
it
,
was
not
perhaps
very
strange
,
and
yet
that
he
could
sit
so
boldly
collected
within
its
view
,
maintain
so
elevated
an
air
,
look
so
fearlessly
around
,
nay
,
that
he
should
even
enter
the
church
,
seemed
wonderful
to
Catherine
.
<EOS>
Not
,
however
,
that
many
instances
of
beings
equally
hardened
in
guilt
might
not
be
produced
.
<EOS>
She
could
remember
dozens
who
had
persevered
in
every
possible
vice
,
going
on
from
crime
to
crime
,
murdering
whomsoever
they
chose
,
without
any
feeling
of
humanity
or
remorse
;
till
a
violent
death
or
a
religious
retirement
closed
their
black
career
.
<EOS>
The
erection
of
the
monument
itself
could
not
in
the
smallest
degree
affect
her
doubts
of
Mrs.
Tilney
's
actual
decease
.
<EOS>
Were
she
even
to
descend
into
the
family
vault
where
her
ashes
were
supposed
to
slumber
,
were
she
to
behold
the
coffin
in
which
they
were
said
to
be
enclosed
 
<EOS>
what
could
it
avail
in
such
a
case
?
<EOS>
Catherine
had
read
too
much
not
to
be
perfectly
aware
of
the
ease
with
which
a
waxen
figure
might
be
introduced
,
and
a
supposititious
funeral
carried
on
.
  
<EOS>
The
succeeding
morning
promised
something
better
.
<EOS>
The
general
's
early
walk
,
ill
-
timed
as
it
was
in
every
other
view
,
was
favourable
here
;
and
when
she
knew
him
to
be
out
of
the
house
,
she
directly
proposed
to
Miss
Tilney
the
accomplishment
of
her
promise
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
ready
to
oblige
her
;
and
Catherine
reminding
her
as
they
went
of
another
promise
,
their
first
visit
in
consequence
was
to
the
portrait
in
her
bed
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
It
represented
a
very
lovely
woman
,
with
a
mild
and
pensive
countenance
,
justifying
,
so
far
,
the
expectations
of
its
new
observer
;
but
they
were
not
in
every
respect
answered
,
for
Catherine
had
depended
upon
meeting
with
features
,
hair
,
complexion
<EOS>
,
that
should
be
the
very
counterpart
,
the
very
image
,
if
not
of
Henry
's
,
of
Eleanor
's
 
the
only
portraits
of
which
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
thinking
,
bearing
always
an
equal
resemblance
of
mother
and
child
.
<EOS>
A
face
once
taken
was
taken
for
generations
.
<EOS>
But
here
she
was
obliged
to
look
and
consider
and
study
for
a
likeness
.
<EOS>
She
contemplated
it
,
however
,
in
spite
of
this
drawback
,
with
much
emotion
,
and
,
but
for
a
yet
stronger
interest
,
would
have
left
it
unwillingly
.
  
<EOS>
Her
agitation
as
they
entered
the
great
gallery
was
too
much
for
any
endeavour
at
discourse
;
she
could
only
look
at
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
countenance
was
dejected
,
yet
sedate
;
and
its
composure
spoke
her
inured
to
all
the
gloomy
objects
to
which
they
were
advancing
.
<EOS>
Again
she
passed
through
the
folding
doors
,
again
her
hand
was
upon
the
important
lock
,
and
Catherine
,
hardly
able
to
breathe
,
was
turning
to
close
the
former
with
fearful
caution
,
when
the
figure
,
the
dreaded
figure
of
the
general
himself
at
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
,
stood
before
her
!
<EOS>
The
name
of
"
Eleanor
"
at
the
same
moment
,
in
his
loudest
tone
,
resounded
through
the
building
,
giving
to
his
daughter
the
first
intimation
of
his
presence
,
and
to
Catherine
terror
upon
terror
.
<EOS>
An
attempt
at
concealment
had
been
her
first
instinctive
movement
on
perceiving
him
,
yet
she
could
scarcely
hope
to
have
escaped
his
eye
;
and
when
her
friend
,
who
with
an
apologizing
look
darted
hastily
by
her
,
had
joined
and
disappeared
with
him
,
she
ran
for
safety
to
her
own
room
,
and
,
locking
herself
in
,
believed
that
she
should
never
have
courage
to
go
down
again
.
<EOS>
She
remained
there
at
least
an
hour
,
in
the
greatest
agitation
,
deeply
commiserating
the
state
of
her
poor
friend
,
and
expecting
a
summons
herself
from
the
angry
general
to
attend
him
in
his
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
No
summons
,
however
,
arrived
;
and
at
last
,
on
seeing
a
carriage
drive
up
to
the
abbey
,
she
was
emboldened
to
descend
and
meet
him
under
the
protection
of
visitors
.
<EOS>
The
breakfast
-
room
was
gay
with
company
;
and
she
was
named
to
them
by
the
general
as
the
friend
of
his
daughter
,
in
a
complimentary
style
,
which
so
well
concealed
his
resentful
ire
,
as
to
make
her
feel
secure
at
least
of
life
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
And
Eleanor
,
with
a
command
of
countenance
which
did
honour
to
her
concern
for
his
character
,
taking
an
early
occasion
of
saying
to
her
,
"
My
father
only
wanted
me
to
answer
a
note
,
"
she
began
to
hope
that
she
had
either
been
unseen
by
the
general
,
or
that
from
some
consideration
of
policy
she
should
be
allowed
to
suppose
herself
so
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
trust
she
dared
still
to
remain
in
his
presence
,
after
the
company
left
them
,
and
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
this
morning
's
reflections
,
she
came
to
a
resolution
of
making
her
next
attempt
on
the
forbidden
door
alone
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
much
better
in
every
respect
that
Eleanor
should
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
To
involve
her
in
the
danger
of
a
second
detection
,
to
court
her
into
an
apartment
which
must
wring
her
heart
,
could
not
be
the
office
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
The
general
's
utmost
anger
could
not
be
to
herself
what
it
might
be
to
a
daughter
;
and
,
besides
,
she
thought
the
examination
itself
would
be
more
satisfactory
if
made
without
any
companion
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
explain
to
Eleanor
the
suspicions
,
from
which
the
other
had
,
in
all
likelihood
,
been
hitherto
happily
exempt
;
nor
could
she
therefore
,
in
her
presence
,
search
for
those
proofs
of
the
general
's
cruelty
,
which
however
they
might
yet
have
escaped
discovery
,
she
felt
confident
of
somewhere
drawing
forth
,
in
the
shape
of
some
fragmented
journal
,
continued
to
the
last
gasp
.
<EOS>
Of
the
way
to
the
apartment
she
was
now
perfectly
mistress
;
and
as
she
wished
to
get
it
over
before
Henry
's
return
,
who
was
expected
on
the
morrow
,
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
bright
,
her
courage
high
;
at
four
o'clock
,
the
sun
was
now
two
hours
above
the
horizon
,
and
it
would
be
only
her
retiring
to
dress
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
done
;
and
Catherine
found
herself
alone
in
the
gallery
before
the
clocks
had
ceased
to
strike
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
time
for
thought
;
she
hurried
on
,
slipped
with
the
least
possible
noise
through
the
folding
doors
,
and
without
stopping
to
look
or
breathe
,
rushed
forward
to
the
one
in
question
.
<EOS>
The
lock
yielded
to
her
hand
,
and
,
luckily
,
with
no
sullen
sound
that
could
alarm
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
On
tiptoe
she
entered
;
the
room
was
before
her
;
but
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
could
advance
another
step
.
<EOS>
She
beheld
what
fixed
her
to
the
spot
and
agitated
every
feature
.
<EOS>
She
saw
a
large
,
well
-
proportioned
apartment
,
an
handsome
dimity
bed
,
arranged
as
unoccupied
with
an
housemaid
's
care
,
a
bright
Bath
stove
,
mahogany
wardrobes
,
and
neatly
painted
chairs
,
on
which
the
warm
beams
of
a
western
sun
gaily
poured
through
two
sash
windows
!
<EOS>
Catherine
had
expected
to
have
her
feelings
worked
,
and
worked
they
were
.
<EOS>
Astonishment
and
doubt
first
seized
them
;
and
a
shortly
succeeding
ray
of
common
sense
added
some
bitter
emotions
of
shame
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
mistaken
as
to
the
room
;
but
how
grossly
mistaken
in
everything
else
!
 
<EOS>
in
Miss
Tilney
's
meaning
,
in
her
own
calculation
!
<EOS>
This
apartment
,
to
which
she
had
given
a
date
so
ancient
,
a
position
so
awful
,
proved
to
be
one
end
of
what
the
general
's
father
had
built
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
other
doors
in
the
chamber
,
leading
probably
into
dressing
-
closets
;
but
she
had
no
inclination
to
open
either
.
<EOS>
Would
the
veil
in
which
Mrs.
Tilney
had
last
walked
,
or
the
volume
in
which
she
had
last
read
,
remain
to
tell
what
nothing
else
was
allowed
to
whisper
?
<EOS>
No
:
whatever
might
have
been
the
general
's
crimes
,
he
had
certainly
too
much
wit
to
let
them
sue
for
detection
.
<EOS>
She
was
sick
of
exploring
,
and
desired
but
to
be
safe
in
her
own
room
,
with
her
own
heart
only
privy
to
its
folly
;
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
retreating
as
softly
as
she
had
entered
,
when
the
sound
of
footsteps
,
she
could
hardly
tell
where
,
made
her
pause
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
To
be
found
there
,
even
by
a
servant
,
would
be
unpleasant
;
but
by
the
general
(
and
he
seemed
always
at
hand
when
least
wanted
)
,
much
worse
!
<EOS>
She
listened
 
the
sound
had
ceased
;
and
resolving
not
to
lose
a
moment
,
she
passed
through
and
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
At
that
instant
a
door
underneath
was
hastily
opened
;
someone
seemed
with
swift
steps
to
ascend
the
stairs
,
by
the
head
of
which
she
had
yet
to
pass
before
she
could
gain
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
power
to
move
.
<EOS>
With
a
feeling
of
terror
not
very
definable
,
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
staircase
,
and
in
a
few
moments
it
gave
Henry
to
her
view
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
more
than
common
astonishment
.
<EOS>
He
looked
astonished
too
.
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
"
<EOS>
she
continued
,
not
attending
to
his
address
.
<EOS>
"
How
came
you
here
?
<EOS>
How
came
you
up
that
staircase
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
came
I
up
that
staircase
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
greatly
surprised
.
"
<EOS>
Because
it
is
my
nearest
way
from
the
stable
-
yard
to
my
own
chamber
;
and
why
should
I
not
come
up
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
recollected
herself
,
blushed
deeply
,
and
could
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
looking
in
her
countenance
for
that
explanation
which
her
lips
did
not
afford
.
<EOS>
She
moved
on
towards
the
gallery
.
"
<EOS>
And
may
I
not
,
in
my
turn
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
pushed
back
the
folding
doors
,
"
ask
how
you
came
here
?
<EOS>
This
passage
is
at
least
as
extraordinary
a
road
from
the
breakfast
-
parlour
to
your
apartment
,
as
that
staircase
can
be
from
the
stables
to
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
,
"
said
Catherine
,
looking
down
,
"
to
see
your
mother
's
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
's
room
!
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
extraordinary
to
be
seen
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
did
not
mean
to
come
back
till
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
expect
to
be
able
to
return
sooner
,
when
I
went
away
;
but
three
hours
ago
I
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
nothing
to
detain
me
.
<EOS>
You
look
pale
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
alarmed
you
by
running
so
fast
up
those
stairs
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
did
not
know
 
you
were
not
aware
of
their
leading
from
the
offices
in
common
use
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
was
not
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
a
very
fine
day
for
your
ride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
;
and
does
Eleanor
leave
you
to
find
your
way
into
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
by
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
she
showed
me
over
the
greatest
part
on
Saturday
 
<EOS>
and
we
were
coming
here
to
these
rooms
 
<EOS>
but
only
"
 
dropping
her
voice
 
"
your
father
was
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
that
prevented
you
,
"
said
Henry
,
earnestly
regarding
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
looked
into
all
the
rooms
in
that
passage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
only
wanted
to
see
 
Is
not
it
very
late
?
<EOS>
I
must
go
and
dress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
a
quarter
past
four
"
showing
his
watch
 
"
and
you
are
not
now
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
No
theatre
,
no
rooms
to
prepare
for
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
at
Northanger
must
be
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
contradict
it
,
and
therefore
suffered
herself
to
be
detained
,
though
her
dread
of
further
questions
made
her
,
for
the
first
time
in
their
acquaintance
,
wish
to
leave
him
.
<EOS>
They
walked
slowly
up
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
had
any
letter
from
Bath
since
I
saw
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
and
I
am
very
much
surprised
.
<EOS>
Isabella
promised
so
faithfully
to
write
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Promised
so
faithfully
!
<EOS>
A
faithful
promise
!
<EOS>
That
puzzles
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
a
faithful
performance
.
<EOS>
But
a
faithful
promise
 
the
fidelity
of
promising
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
power
little
worth
knowing
,
however
,
since
it
can
deceive
and
pain
you
.
<EOS>
My
mother
's
room
is
very
commodious
,
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
Large
and
cheerful
-
looking
,
and
the
dressing
-
closets
so
well
disposed
!
<EOS>
It
always
strikes
me
as
the
most
comfortable
apartment
in
the
house
,
and
I
rather
wonder
that
Eleanor
should
not
take
it
for
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
sent
you
to
look
at
it
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
your
own
doing
entirely
?
"
<EOS>
Catherine
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
silence
,
during
which
he
had
closely
observed
her
,
he
added
,
"
As
there
is
nothing
in
the
room
in
itself
to
raise
curiosity
,
this
must
have
proceeded
from
a
sentiment
of
respect
for
my
mother
's
character
,
as
described
by
Eleanor
,
which
does
honour
to
her
memory
.
<EOS>
The
world
,
I
believe
,
never
saw
a
better
woman
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
often
that
virtue
can
boast
an
interest
such
as
this
.
<EOS>
The
domestic
,
unpretending
merits
of
a
person
never
known
do
not
often
create
that
kind
of
fervent
,
venerating
tenderness
which
would
prompt
a
visit
like
yours
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
I
suppose
,
has
talked
of
her
a
great
deal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
That
is
 
no
,
not
much
,
but
what
she
did
say
was
very
interesting
.
<EOS>
Her
dying
so
suddenly
"
(
slowly
,
and
with
hesitation
it
was
spoken
)
,
"
and
you
 
<EOS>
none
of
you
being
at
home
 
and
your
father
<EOS>
,
I
thought
 
perhaps
had
not
been
very
fond
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
from
these
circumstances
,
"
he
replied
(
his
quick
eye
fixed
on
hers
)
,
"
you
infer
perhaps
the
probability
of
some
negligence
 
<EOS>
some
"
 
(
involuntarily
she
shook
her
head
)
 
"
or
it
may
be
 
of
something
still
less
pardonable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
raised
her
eyes
towards
him
more
fully
than
she
had
ever
done
before
.
<EOS>
"
My
mother
's
illness
,
"
he
continued
,
"
the
seizure
which
ended
in
her
death
,
was
sudden
.
<EOS>
The
malady
itself
,
one
from
which
she
had
often
suffered
,
a
bilious
fever
 
<EOS>
its
cause
therefore
constitutional
.
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
,
in
short
,
as
soon
as
she
could
be
prevailed
on
,
a
physician
attended
her
,
a
very
respectable
man
,
and
one
in
whom
she
had
always
placed
great
confidence
.
<EOS>
Upon
his
opinion
of
her
danger
,
two
others
were
called
in
the
next
day
,
and
remained
in
almost
constant
attendance
for
four
and
twenty
hours
.
<EOS>
On
the
fifth
day
she
died
.
<EOS>
During
the
progress
of
her
disorder
,
Frederick
and
I
(
we
were
both
at
home
)
saw
her
repeatedly
;
and
from
our
own
observation
can
bear
witness
to
her
having
received
every
possible
attention
which
could
spring
from
the
affection
of
those
about
her
,
or
which
her
situation
in
life
could
command
.
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
was
absent
,
and
at
such
a
distance
as
to
return
only
to
see
her
mother
in
her
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
your
father
,
"
said
Catherine
,
"
was
he
afflicted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
a
time
,
greatly
so
.
<EOS>
You
have
erred
in
supposing
him
not
attached
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
loved
her
,
I
am
persuaded
,
as
well
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
 
<EOS>
we
have
not
all
,
you
know
,
the
same
tenderness
of
disposition
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
while
she
lived
,
she
might
not
often
have
had
much
to
bear
,
but
though
his
temper
injured
her
,
his
judgment
never
did
.
<EOS>
His
value
of
her
was
sincere
;
and
,
if
not
permanently
,
he
was
truly
afflicted
by
her
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
of
it
,
"
said
Catherine
;
"
it
would
have
been
very
shocking
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
understand
you
rightly
,
you
had
formed
a
surmise
of
such
horror
as
I
have
hardly
words
to
 
Dear
Miss
Morland
,
consider
the
dreadful
nature
of
the
suspicions
you
have
entertained
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
been
judging
from
?
<EOS>
Remember
the
country
and
the
age
in
which
we
live
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
we
are
English
,
that
we
are
Christians
.
<EOS>
Consult
your
own
understanding
,
your
own
sense
of
the
probable
,
your
own
observation
of
what
is
passing
around
you
.
<EOS>
Does
our
education
prepare
us
for
such
atrocities
?
<EOS>
Do
our
laws
connive
at
them
?
<EOS>
Could
they
be
perpetrated
without
being
known
,
in
a
country
like
this
,
where
social
and
literary
intercourse
is
on
such
a
footing
,
where
every
man
is
surrounded
by
a
neighbourhood
of
voluntary
spies
,
and
where
roads
and
newspapers
lay
everything
open
?
<EOS>
Dearest
Miss
Morland
,
what
ideas
have
you
been
admitting
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
reached
the
end
of
the
gallery
,
and
with
tears
of
shame
she
ran
off
to
her
own
room
.
    
<EOS>
The
visions
of
romance
were
over
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
completely
awakened
.
<EOS>
Henry
's
address
,
short
as
it
had
been
,
had
more
thoroughly
opened
her
eyes
to
the
extravagance
of
her
late
fancies
than
all
their
several
disappointments
had
done
.
<EOS>
Most
grievously
was
she
humbled
.
<EOS>
Most
bitterly
did
she
cry
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
with
herself
that
she
was
sunk
 
but
with
Henry
.
<EOS>
Her
folly
,
which
now
seemed
even
criminal
,
was
all
exposed
to
him
,
and
he
must
despise
her
forever
.
<EOS>
The
liberty
which
her
imagination
had
dared
to
take
with
the
character
of
his
father
 
<EOS>
could
he
ever
forgive
it
?
<EOS>
The
absurdity
of
her
curiosity
and
her
fears
 
<EOS>
could
they
ever
be
forgotten
?
<EOS>
She
hated
herself
more
than
she
could
express
.
<EOS>
He
had
 
<EOS>
she
thought
he
had
,
once
or
twice
before
this
fatal
morning
,
shown
something
like
affection
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
now
 
in
short
,
she
made
herself
as
miserable
as
possible
for
about
half
an
hour
,
went
down
when
the
clock
struck
five
,
with
a
broken
heart
,
and
could
scarcely
give
an
intelligible
answer
to
Eleanor
's
inquiry
if
she
was
well
.
<EOS>
The
formidable
Henry
soon
followed
her
into
the
room
,
and
the
only
difference
in
his
behaviour
to
her
was
that
he
paid
her
rather
more
attention
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Catherine
had
never
wanted
comfort
more
,
and
he
looked
as
if
he
was
aware
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
wore
away
with
no
abatement
of
this
soothing
politeness
;
and
her
spirits
were
gradually
raised
to
a
modest
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
learn
either
to
forget
or
defend
the
past
;
but
she
learned
to
hope
that
it
would
never
transpire
farther
,
and
that
it
might
not
cost
her
Henry
's
entire
regard
.
<EOS>
Her
thoughts
being
still
chiefly
fixed
on
what
she
had
with
such
causeless
terror
felt
and
done
,
nothing
could
shortly
be
clearer
than
that
it
had
been
all
a
voluntary
,
self
-
created
delusion
,
each
trifling
circumstance
receiving
importance
from
an
imagination
resolved
on
alarm
,
and
everything
forced
to
bend
to
one
purpose
by
a
mind
which
,
before
she
entered
the
abbey
,
had
been
craving
to
be
frightened
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
with
what
feelings
she
had
prepared
for
a
knowledge
of
Northanger
.
<EOS>
She
saw
that
the
infatuation
had
been
created
,
the
mischief
settled
,
long
before
her
quitting
Bath
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
might
be
traced
to
the
influence
of
that
sort
of
reading
which
she
had
there
indulged
.
  
<EOS>
Charming
<EOS>
as
were
all
Mrs.
Radcliffe
's
works
,
and
charming
even
as
were
the
works
of
all
her
imitators
,
it
was
not
in
them
perhaps
that
human
nature
,
at
least
in
the
Midland
counties
of
England
,
was
to
be
looked
for
.
<EOS>
Of
the
Alps
and
Pyrenees
,
with
their
pine
forests
and
their
vices
,
they
might
give
a
faithful
delineation
;
and
Italy
,
Switzerland
,
and
the
south
of
France
might
be
as
fruitful
in
horrors
as
they
were
there
represented
.
<EOS>
Catherine
dared
not
doubt
beyond
her
own
country
,
and
even
of
that
,
if
hard
pressed
,
would
have
yielded
the
northern
and
western
extremities
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
central
part
of
England
there
was
surely
some
security
for
the
existence
even
of
a
wife
not
beloved
,
in
the
laws
of
the
land
,
and
the
manners
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
Murder
was
not
tolerated
,
servants
were
not
slaves
,
and
neither
poison
nor
sleeping
potions
to
be
procured
,
like
rhubarb
,
from
every
druggist
.
<EOS>
Among
the
Alps
and
Pyrenees
,
perhaps
,
there
were
no
mixed
characters
.
<EOS>
There
,
such
as
were
not
as
spotless
as
an
angel
might
have
the
dispositions
of
a
fiend
.
<EOS>
But
in
England
it
was
not
so
;
among
the
English
,
she
believed
,
in
their
hearts
and
habits
,
there
was
a
general
though
unequal
mixture
of
good
and
bad
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
conviction
,
she
would
not
be
surprised
if
even
in
Henry
and
Eleanor
Tilney
,
some
slight
imperfection
might
hereafter
appear
;
and
upon
this
conviction
she
need
not
fear
to
acknowledge
some
actual
specks
in
the
character
of
their
father
,
who
,
though
cleared
from
the
grossly
injurious
suspicions
which
she
must
ever
blush
to
have
entertained
,
she
did
believe
,
upon
serious
consideration
,
to
be
not
perfectly
amiable
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
made
up
on
these
several
points
,
and
her
resolution
formed
,
of
always
judging
and
acting
in
future
with
the
greatest
good
sense
,
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
forgive
herself
and
be
happier
than
ever
;
and
the
lenient
hand
of
time
did
much
for
her
by
insensible
gradations
in
the
course
of
another
day
.
<EOS>
Henry
's
astonishing
generosity
and
nobleness
of
conduct
,
in
never
alluding
in
the
slightest
way
to
what
had
passed
,
was
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
her
;
and
sooner
than
she
could
have
supposed
it
possible
in
the
beginning
of
her
distress
,
her
spirits
became
absolutely
comfortable
,
and
capable
,
as
heretofore
,
of
continual
improvement
by
anything
he
said
.
<EOS>
There
were
still
some
subjects
,
indeed
,
under
which
she
believed
they
must
always
tremble
 
the
mention
of
a
chest
or
a
cabinet
,
for
instance
 
<EOS>
and
she
did
not
love
the
sight
of
japan
in
any
shape
:
<EOS>
but
even
she
could
allow
that
an
occasional
memento
of
past
folly
,
however
painful
,
might
not
be
without
use
.
  
<EOS>
The
anxieties
of
common
life
began
soon
to
succeed
to
the
alarms
of
romance
.
<EOS>
Her
desire
of
hearing
from
Isabella
grew
every
day
greater
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
impatient
to
know
how
the
Bath
world
went
on
,
and
how
the
rooms
were
attended
;
and
especially
was
she
anxious
to
be
assured
of
<EOS>
Isabella
's
having
matched
some
fine
netting
-
cotton
,
on
which
she
had
left
her
intent
;
and
of
her
continuing
on
the
best
terms
with
James
.
<EOS>
Her
only
dependence
for
information
of
any
kind
was
on
Isabella
.
<EOS>
James
had
protested
against
writing
to
her
till
his
return
to
Oxford
;
and
Mrs.
Allen
had
given
her
no
hopes
of
a
letter
till
she
had
got
back
to
Fullerton
.
<EOS>
But
Isabella
had
promised
and
promised
again
;
and
when
she
promised
a
thing
,
she
was
so
scrupulous
in
performing
it
!
<EOS>
This
made
it
so
particularly
strange
!
  
<EOS>
For
nine
successive
mornings
,
Catherine
wondered
over
the
repetition
of
a
disappointment
,
which
each
morning
became
more
severe
:
but
,
on
the
tenth
,
when
she
entered
the
breakfast
-
room
,
her
first
object
was
a
letter
,
held
out
by
Henry
's
willing
hand
.
<EOS>
She
thanked
him
as
heartily
as
if
he
had
written
it
himself
.
"
<EOS>
'
tis
only
from
James
,
however
,
"
as
she
looked
at
the
direction
.
<EOS>
She
opened
it
;
it
was
from
Oxford
;
and
to
this
purpose
:
  
"
Dear
Catherine
,
  
"
<EOS>
Though
,
God
knows
,
with
little
inclination
for
writing
,
I
think
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
everything
is
at
an
end
between
Miss
Thorpe
and
me
.
<EOS>
I
left
her
and
Bath
yesterday
,
never
to
see
either
again
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
enter
into
particulars
 
they
would
only
pain
you
more
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
hear
enough
from
another
quarter
to
know
where
lies
the
blame
;
and
I
hope
will
acquit
your
brother
of
everything
<EOS>
but
the
folly
of
too
easily
thinking
his
affection
returned
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
am
undeceived
in
time
!
<EOS>
But
it
is
a
heavy
blow
!
<EOS>
After
my
father
's
consent
had
been
so
kindly
given
 
<EOS>
but
no
more
of
this
.
<EOS>
She
has
made
me
miserable
forever
!
<EOS>
Let
me
soon
hear
from
you
,
dear
Catherine
;
you
are
my
only
friend
;
your
love
I
do
build
upon
.
<EOS>
I
wish
your
visit
at
Northanger
may
be
over
before
Captain
Tilney
makes
his
engagement
known
,
or
you
will
be
uncomfortably
circumstanced
.
<EOS>
Poor
Thorpe
is
in
town
:
I
dread
the
sight
of
him
;
his
honest
heart
would
feel
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
have
written
to
him
and
my
father
.
<EOS>
Her
duplicity
hurts
me
more
than
all
;
till
the
very
last
,
if
I
reasoned
with
her
,
she
declared
herself
as
much
attached
to
me
as
ever
,
and
laughed
at
my
fears
.
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
to
think
how
long
I
bore
with
it
;
but
if
ever
man
had
reason
to
believe
himself
loved
,
I
was
that
man
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
even
now
what
she
would
be
at
,
for
there
could
be
no
need
of
my
being
played
off
to
make
her
secure
of
Tilney
.
<EOS>
We
parted
at
last
by
mutual
consent
 
happy
for
me
<EOS>
had
we
never
met
!
<EOS>
I
can
never
expect
to
know
such
another
woman
!
<EOS>
Dearest
Catherine
,
beware
how
you
give
your
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Believe
me
,
"
&
c.
  
Catherine
had
not
read
three
lines
before
her
sudden
change
of
countenance
,
and
short
exclamations
of
sorrowing
wonder
,
declared
her
to
be
receiving
unpleasant
news
;
and
Henry
,
earnestly
watching
her
through
the
whole
letter
,
saw
plainly
that
it
ended
no
better
than
it
began
.
<EOS>
He
was
prevented
,
however
,
from
even
looking
his
surprise
by
his
father
's
entrance
.
<EOS>
They
went
to
breakfast
directly
;
but
Catherine
could
hardly
eat
anything
.
<EOS>
Tears
filled
her
eyes
,
and
even
ran
down
her
cheeks
as
she
sat
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
one
moment
in
her
hand
,
then
in
her
lap
,
and
then
in
her
pocket
;
and
she
looked
as
if
she
knew
not
what
she
did
.
<EOS>
The
general
,
between
his
cocoa
and
his
newspaper
,
had
luckily
no
leisure
for
noticing
her
;
but
to
the
other
two
her
distress
was
equally
visible
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
dared
leave
the
table
she
hurried
away
to
her
own
room
;
but
the
housemaids
were
busy
in
it
,
and
she
was
obliged
to
come
down
again
.
<EOS>
She
turned
into
the
drawing
-
room
for
privacy
,
but
Henry
and
Eleanor
had
likewise
retreated
thither
,
and
were
at
that
moment
deep
in
consultation
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
drew
back
,
trying
to
beg
their
pardon
,
but
was
,
with
gentle
violence
,
forced
to
return
;
and
the
others
withdrew
,
after
Eleanor
had
affectionately
expressed
a
wish
of
being
of
use
or
comfort
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
After
half
an
hour
's
free
indulgence
of
grief
and
reflection
,
Catherine
felt
equal
to
encountering
her
friends
;
but
whether
she
should
make
her
distress
known
to
them
was
another
consideration
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
if
particularly
questioned
,
she
might
just
give
an
idea
 
just
distantly
hint
at
it
 
but
not
more
.
<EOS>
To
expose
a
friend
,
such
a
friend
as
Isabella
had
been
to
her
 
<EOS>
and
then
their
own
brother
so
closely
concerned
in
it
!
<EOS>
She
believed
she
must
waive
the
subject
altogether
.
<EOS>
Henry
and
Eleanor
were
by
themselves
in
the
breakfast
-
room
;
and
each
,
as
she
entered
it
,
looked
at
her
anxiously
.
<EOS>
Catherine
took
her
place
at
the
table
,
and
,
after
a
short
silence
,
Eleanor
said
,
"
No
bad
news
from
Fullerton
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
 
<EOS>
your
brothers
and
sisters
 
I
hope
they
are
none
of
them
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
thank
you
"
(
sighing
as
she
spoke
)
;
"
they
are
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
My
letter
was
from
my
brother
at
Oxford
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nothing
further
was
said
for
a
few
minutes
;
and
then
speaking
through
her
tears
,
she
added
,
"
I
do
not
think
I
shall
ever
wish
for
a
letter
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
"
said
Henry
,
closing
the
book
he
had
just
opened
;
"
if
I
had
suspected
the
letter
of
containing
anything
unwelcome
,
I
should
have
given
it
with
very
different
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
contained
something
worse
than
anybody
could
suppose
!
<EOS>
Poor
James
is
so
unhappy
!
<EOS>
You
will
soon
know
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
have
so
kind
-
hearted
,
so
affectionate
a
sister
,
"
replied
Henry
warmly
,
"
must
be
a
comfort
to
him
under
any
distress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
one
favour
to
beg
,
"
said
Catherine
,
shortly
afterwards
,
in
an
agitated
manner
,
"
that
,
if
your
brother
should
be
coming
here
,
you
will
give
me
notice
of
it
,
that
I
may
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Our
brother
!
<EOS>
Frederick
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
am
sure
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
leave
you
so
soon
,
but
something
has
happened
that
would
make
it
very
dreadful
for
me
to
be
in
the
same
house
with
Captain
Tilney
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
work
was
suspended
while
she
gazed
with
increasing
astonishment
;
but
Henry
began
to
suspect
the
truth
,
and
something
,
in
which
Miss
Thorpe
's
name
was
included
,
passed
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
quick
you
are
!
"
cried
Catherine
:
"
you
have
guessed
it
,
I
declare
!
<EOS>
And
yet
,
when
we
talked
about
it
in
Bath
,
you
little
thought
of
its
ending
so
.
<EOS>
Isabella
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
now
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
from
her
 
Isabella
<EOS>
has
deserted
my
brother
,
and
is
to
marry
yours
!
<EOS>
Could
you
have
believed
there
had
been
such
inconstancy
and
fickleness
,
and
everything
that
is
bad
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
so
far
as
concerns
my
brother
,
you
are
misinformed
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
has
not
had
any
material
share
in
bringing
on
Mr.
Morland
's
disappointment
.
<EOS>
His
marrying
Miss
Thorpe
is
not
probable
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
must
be
deceived
so
far
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
for
Mr.
Morland
 
sorry
that
anyone
you
love
should
be
unhappy
;
but
my
surprise
would
be
greater
at
Frederick
's
marrying
her
than
at
any
other
part
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
true
,
however
;
you
shall
read
James
's
letter
yourself
.
<EOS>
Stay
 
<EOS>
There
is
one
part
 
"
recollecting
with
a
blush
the
last
line
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
the
trouble
of
reading
to
us
the
passages
which
concern
my
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
read
it
yourself
,
"
cried
Catherine
,
whose
second
thoughts
were
clearer
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
I
was
thinking
of
"
(
blushing
again
that
she
had
blushed
before
)
;
"
James
only
means
to
give
me
good
advice
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
gladly
received
the
letter
,
and
,
having
read
it
through
,
with
close
attention
,
returned
it
saying
,
"
<EOS>
Well
,
if
it
is
to
be
so
,
I
can
only
say
that
I
am
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
Frederick
will
not
be
the
first
man
who
has
chosen
a
wife
with
less
sense
than
his
family
expected
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
envy
his
situation
,
either
as
a
lover
or
a
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tilney
,
at
Catherine
's
invitation
,
now
read
the
letter
likewise
,
and
,
having
expressed
also
her
concern
and
surprise
,
began
to
inquire
into
Miss
Thorpe
's
connections
and
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
mother
is
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
,
"
was
Catherine
's
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
her
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
lawyer
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
They
live
at
Putney
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
they
a
wealthy
family
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
very
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
Isabella
has
any
fortune
at
all
:
but
that
will
not
signify
in
your
family
.
<EOS>
Your
father
is
so
very
liberal
!
<EOS>
He
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
only
valued
money
as
it
allowed
him
to
promote
the
happiness
of
his
children
.
"
<EOS>
The
brother
and
sister
looked
at
each
other
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
would
it
be
to
promote
his
happiness
,
to
enable
him
to
marry
such
a
girl
?
<EOS>
She
must
be
an
unprincipled
one
,
or
she
could
not
have
used
your
brother
so
.
<EOS>
And
how
strange
an
infatuation
on
Frederick
's
side
!
<EOS>
A
girl
who
,
before
his
eyes
,
is
violating
an
engagement
voluntarily
entered
into
with
another
man
!
<EOS>
Is
not
it
inconceivable
,
Henry
?
<EOS>
Frederick
too
,
who
always
wore
his
heart
so
proudly
!
<EOS>
Who
found
no
woman
good
enough
to
be
loved
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
most
unpromising
circumstance
,
the
strongest
presumption
against
him
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
his
past
declarations
,
I
give
him
up
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
have
too
good
<EOS>
an
opinion
of
Miss
Thorpe
's
prudence
to
suppose
that
she
would
part
with
one
gentleman
before
the
other
was
secured
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
over
with
Frederick
indeed
!

Prepare
for
your
sister
-
in
-
law
,
Eleanor
,
and
such
a
sister
-
in
-
law
as
you
must
delight
in
!
<EOS>
Open
,
candid
,
artless
,
guileless
,
with
affections
strong
but
simple
,
forming
no
pretensions
,
and
knowing
no
disguise

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
sister
-
in
-
law
,
Henry
,
I
should
delight
in
,
"
said
Eleanor
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
,
"
observed
Catherine
,
"
though
she
has
behaved
so
ill
by
our
family
,
she
may
behave
better
by
yours
.
<EOS>
Now
she
has
really
got
the
man
she
likes
,
she
may
be
constant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
afraid
she
will
,
"
replied
Henry
;
"
I
am
afraid
she
will
be
very
constant
,
unless
a
baronet
should
come
in
her
way
;
that
is
Frederick
's
only
chance
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
the
Bath
paper
,
and
look
over
the
arrivals
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
it
is
all
for
ambition
,
then
?
<EOS>
And
,
upon
my
word
,
there
are
some
things
that
seem
very
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
forget
that
,
when
she
first
knew
what
my
father
would
do
for
them
,
she
seemed
quite
disappointed
that
it
was
not
more
.
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
deceived
in
anyone
's
character
in
my
life
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Among
all
the
great
variety
that
you
have
known
and
studied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
disappointment
and
loss
in
her
is
very
great
;
but
,
as
for
poor
James
,
I
suppose
he
will
hardly
ever
recover
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
brother
is
certainly
very
much
to
be
pitied
at
present
;
but
we
must
not
,
in
our
concern
for
his
sufferings
,
undervalue
yours
.
<EOS>
You
feel
,
I
suppose
,
that
in
losing
Isabella
,
you
lose
half
yourself
:
<EOS>
you
feel
a
void
in
your
heart
which
nothing
else
can
occupy
.
<EOS>
Society
is
becoming
irksome
;
and
as
for
the
amusements
in
which
you
were
wo
nt
to
share
at
Bath
,
the
very
idea
of
them
without
her
is
abhorrent
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
,
for
instance
,
now
go
to
a
ball
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
You
feel
that
you
have
no
longer
any
friend
to
whom
you
can
speak
with
unreserve
,
on
whose
regard
you
can
place
dependence
,
or
whose
counsel
,
in
any
difficulty
,
you
could
rely
on
.
<EOS>
You
feel
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Catherine
,
after
a
few
moments
'
reflection
,
"
I
do
not
 
ought
I
?
<EOS>
To
say
the
truth
,
though
I
am
hurt
and
grieved
,
that
I
can
not
still
love
her
,
that
I
am
never
to
hear
from
her
,
perhaps
never
to
see
her
again
,
I
do
not
feel
so
very
,
very
much
afflicted
as
one
would
have
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
feel
,
as
you
always
do
,
what
is
most
to
the
credit
of
human
nature
.
<EOS>
Such
feelings
ought
to
be
investigated
,
that
they
may
know
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
by
some
chance
or
other
,
found
her
spirits
so
very
much
relieved
by
this
conversation
that
she
could
not
regret
her
being
led
on
,
though
so
unaccountably
,
to
mention
the
circumstance
which
had
produced
it
.
    
<EOS>
From
this
time
,
the
subject
was
frequently
canvassed
by
the
three
young
people
;
and
Catherine
found
,
with
some
surprise
,
that
her
two
young
friends
were
perfectly
agreed
in
considering
Isabella
's
want
of
consequence
and
fortune
as
likely
to
throw
great
difficulties
in
the
way
of
her
marrying
their
brother
.
<EOS>
Their
persuasion
that
the
general
would
,
upon
this
ground
alone
,
independent
of
the
objection
that
might
be
raised
against
her
character
,
oppose
the
connection
,
turned
her
feelings
moreover
with
some
alarm
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
insignificant
,
and
perhaps
as
portionless
,
as
Isabella
;
and
if
the
heir
of
the
Tilney
property
had
not
grandeur
and
wealth
enough
in
himself
,
at
what
point
of
interest
were
the
demands
of
his
younger
brother
to
rest
?
<EOS>
The
very
painful
reflections
to
which
this
thought
led
could
only
be
dispersed
by
a
dependence
on
the
effect
of
that
particular
partiality
,
which
,
as
she
was
given
to
understand
by
his
words
as
well
as
his
actions
,
she
had
from
the
first
been
so
fortunate
as
to
excite
in
the
general
;
and
by
a
recollection
of
some
most
generous
and
disinterested
sentiments
on
the
subject
of
money
,
which
she
had
more
than
once
heard
him
utter
,
and
which
tempted
her
to
think
his
disposition
in
such
matters
misunderstood
by
his
children
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
so
fully
convinced
,
however
,
that
their
brother
would
not
have
the
courage
to
apply
in
person
for
his
father
's
consent
,
and
so
repeatedly
assured
her
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
less
likely
to
come
to
Northanger
than
at
the
present
time
,
that
she
suffered
her
mind
to
be
at
ease
as
to
the
necessity
of
any
sudden
removal
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
Captain
Tilney
,
whenever
he
made
his
application
,
would
give
his
father
any
just
idea
of
Isabella
's
conduct
,
it
occurred
to
her
as
highly
expedient
that
Henry
should
lay
the
whole
business
before
him
as
it
really
was
,
enabling
the
general
by
that
means
to
form
a
cool
and
impartial
opinion
,
and
prepare
his
objections
on
a
fairer
ground
than
inequality
of
situations
.
<EOS>
She
proposed
it
to
him
accordingly
;
but
he
did
not
catch
at
the
measure
so
eagerly
as
she
had
expected
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
he
,
"
my
father
's
hands
need
not
be
strengthened
,
and
Frederick
's
confession
of
folly
need
not
be
forestalled
.
<EOS>
He
must
tell
his
own
story
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
will
tell
only
half
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
quarter
would
be
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
passed
away
and
brought
no
tidings
of
Captain
Tilney
.
<EOS>
His
brother
and
sister
knew
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
it
appeared
to
them
as
if
his
silence
would
be
the
natural
result
of
the
suspected
engagement
,
and
at
others
that
it
was
wholly
incompatible
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
general
,
meanwhile
,
though
offended
every
morning
by
Frederick
's
remissness
in
writing
,
was
free
from
any
real
anxiety
about
him
,
and
had
no
more
pressing
solicitude
than
that
of
making
Miss
Morland
's
time
at
Northanger
pass
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
He
often
expressed
his
uneasiness
on
this
head
,
feared
the
sameness
of
every
day
's
society
and
employments
would
disgust
her
with
the
place
,
wished
the
Lady
Frasers
had
been
in
the
country
,
talked
every
now
and
then
of
having
a
large
party
to
dinner
,
and
once
or
twice
began
even
to
calculate
the
number
of
young
dancing
people
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
was
such
a
dead
time
of
year
,
no
wild
-
fowl
,
no
game
,
and
the
Lady
Frasers
were
not
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
And
it
all
ended
,
at
last
,
in
his
telling
Henry
one
morning
that
when
he
next
went
to
Woodston
,
they
would
take
him
by
surprise
there
some
day
or
other
,
and
eat
their
mutton
with
him
.
<EOS>
Henry
was
greatly
honoured
and
very
happy
,
and
Catherine
was
quite
delighted
with
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
"
And
when
do
you
think
,
sir
,
I
may
look
forward
to
this
pleasure
?
<EOS>
I
must
be
at
Woodston
on
Monday
to
attend
the
parish
meeting
,
and
shall
probably
be
obliged
to
stay
two
or
three
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
we
will
take
our
chance
some
one
of
those
days
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
to
fix
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
put
yourself
at
all
out
of
your
way
.
<EOS>
Whatever
you
may
happen
to
have
in
the
house
will
be
enough
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
answer
for
the
young
ladies
making
allowance
for
a
bachelor
's
table
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
;
Monday
will
be
a
busy
day
with
you
,
we
will
not
come
on
Monday
;
and
Tuesday
will
be
a
busy
one
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
expect
my
surveyor
from
Brockham
with
his
report
in
the
morning
;
and
afterwards
I
can
not
in
<EOS>
decency
fail
attending
the
club
.
<EOS>
I
really
could
not
face
my
acquaintance
if
I
stayed
away
now
;
for
,
as
I
am
known
to
be
in
the
country
,
it
would
be
taken
exceedingly
amiss
;
and
it
is
a
rule
with
me
,
Miss
Morland
,
never
to
give
offence
to
any
of
my
neighbours
,
if
a
small
sacrifice
of
time
and
attention
can
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
They
are
a
set
of
very
worthy
men
.
<EOS>
They
have
half
a
buck
from
Northanger
twice
a
year
;
and
I
dine
with
them
whenever
I
can
.
<EOS>
Tuesday
,
therefore
,
we
may
say
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
But
on
Wednesday
,
I
think
,
Henry
,
you
may
expect
us
;
and
we
shall
be
with
you
early
,
that
we
may
have
time
to
look
about
us
.
<EOS>
Two
hours
and
three
quarters
will
carry
us
to
Woodston
,
I
suppose
;
we
shall
be
in
the
carriage
by
ten
;
so
,
about
a
quarter
before
one
on
Wednesday
,
you
may
look
for
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
ball
itself
could
not
have
been
more
welcome
to
Catherine
than
this
little
excursion
,
so
strong
was
her
desire
to
be
acquainted
with
Woodston
;
and
her
heart
was
still
bounding
with
joy
when
Henry
,
about
an
hour
afterwards
,
came
booted
and
greatcoated
into
the
room
where
she
and
Eleanor
were
sitting
,
and
said
,
"
I
am
come
,
young
ladies
,
in
a
very
moralizing
strain
,
to
observe
that
our
pleasures
in
this
world
are
always
to
be
paid
for
,
and
that
we
often
purchase
them
at
a
great
disadvantage
,
giving
ready
-
monied
actual
happiness
for
a
draft
on
the
future
,
that
may
not
be
honoured
.
<EOS>
Witness
myself
,
at
this
present
hour
.
<EOS>
Because
I
am
to
hope
for
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
you
at
Woodston
on
Wednesday
,
which
bad
weather
,
or
twenty
other
causes
,
may
prevent
,
I
must
go
away
directly
,
two
days
before
I
intended
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
away
!
"
<EOS>
said
Catherine
,
with
a
very
long
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
How
can
you
ask
the
question
?
<EOS>
Because
no
time
is
to
be
lost
in
frightening
my
old
housekeeper
out
of
her
wits
,
because
I
must
go
and
prepare
a
dinner
for
you
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Not
seriously
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
and
sadly
too
 
for
I
had
much
rather
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
,
after
what
the
general
said
?
<EOS>
When
he
so
particularly
desired
you
not
to
give
yourself
any
trouble
,
because
anything
would
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Henry
only
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
it
is
quite
unnecessary
upon
your
sister
's
account
and
mine
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
it
to
be
so
;
and
the
general
made
such
a
point
of
your
providing
nothing
extraordinary
:
besides
,
if
he
had
not
said
half
so
much
as
he
did
,
he
has
always
such
an
excellent
dinner
at
home
,
that
sitting
down
to
a
middling
one
for
one
day
could
not
signify
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
reason
like
you
,
for
his
sake
and
my
own
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
As
tomorrow
is
Sunday
,
Eleanor
,
I
shall
not
return
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
;
and
,
it
being
at
any
time
a
much
simpler
operation
to
Catherine
to
doubt
her
own
judgment
than
Henry
's
,
<EOS>
she
was
very
soon
obliged
to
give
him
credit
for
being
right
,
however
disagreeable
to
her
his
going
.
<EOS>
But
the
inexplicability
of
the
general
's
conduct
dwelt
much
on
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
very
particular
in
his
eating
<EOS>
,
she
had
,
by
her
own
unassisted
observation
,
already
discovered
;
but
why
he
should
say
one
thing
so
positively
,
and
mean
another
all
the
while
,
was
most
unaccountable
!
<EOS>
How
were
people
,
at
that
rate
,
to
be
understood
?
<EOS>
Who
but
Henry
could
have
been
aware
of
what
his
father
was
at
?
  
<EOS>
From
Saturday
to
Wednesday
,
however
,
they
were
now
to
be
without
Henry
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
sad
finale
of
every
reflection
:
and
Captain
Tilney
's
letter
would
certainly
come
in
his
absence
;
and
Wednesday
she
was
very
sure
would
be
wet
.
<EOS>
The
past
,
present
,
and
future
were
all
equally
in
gloom
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
so
unhappy
,
and
her
loss
in
Isabella
so
great
;
and
Eleanor
's
spirits
always
affected
by
Henry
's
absence
!
<EOS>
What
was
there
to
interest
or
amuse
her
?
<EOS>
She
was
tired
of
the
woods
and
the
shrubberies
 
always
so
smooth
and
so
dry
;
and
the
abbey
in
itself
was
no
more
to
her
now
than
any
other
house
.
<EOS>
The
painful
remembrance
of
the
folly
it
had
helped
to
nourish
and
perfect
was
the
only
emotion
which
could
spring
from
a
consideration
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
What
a
revolution
in
her
ideas
!
<EOS>
She
,
who
had
so
longed
to
be
in
an
abbey
!
<EOS>
Now
,
there
was
nothing
so
charming
to
her
imagination
as
the
unpretending
comfort
of
a
well
-
connected
parsonage
,
something
like
Fullerton
,
but
better
<EOS>
:
Fullerton
had
its
faults
,
but
Woodston
probably
had
none
.
<EOS>
If
Wednesday
should
ever
come
!
  
<EOS>
It
did
come
,
and
exactly
when
it
might
be
reasonably
looked
for
.
<EOS>
It
came
 
<EOS>
it
was
fine
 
and
Catherine
trod
on
air
.
<EOS>
By
ten
o'clock
,
the
chaise
and
four
conveyed
the
trio
from
the
abbey
;
and
,
after
an
agreeable
drive
of
almost
twenty
miles
,
they
entered
Woodston
,
a
large
and
populous
village
,
in
a
situation
not
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
ashamed
to
say
how
pretty
she
thought
it
,
as
the
general
seemed
to
think
an
apology
necessary
for
the
flatness
of
the
country
,
and
the
size
of
the
village
;
but
in
her
heart
she
preferred
it
to
any
place
she
had
ever
been
at
,
and
looked
with
great
admiration
at
every
neat
house
above
the
rank
of
a
cottage
,
and
at
all
the
little
chandler
's
shops
which
they
passed
.
<EOS>
At
the
further
end
of
the
village
,
and
tolerably
disengaged
from
the
rest
of
it
,
stood
the
parsonage
,
a
new
-
built
substantial
stone
house
,
with
its
semicircular
sweep
and
green
gates
;
and
,
as
they
drove
up
to
the
door
,
Henry
,
with
the
friends
of
his
solitude
,
a
large
Newfoundland
puppy
and
two
or
three
terriers
,
was
ready
to
receive
and
make
much
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
mind
was
too
full
,
as
she
entered
the
house
,
for
her
either
to
observe
or
to
say
a
great
deal
;
and
,
till
called
on
by
the
general
for
her
opinion
of
it
<EOS>
,
she
had
very
little
idea
of
the
room
in
which
she
was
sitting
.
<EOS>
Upon
looking
round
it
then
,
she
perceived
in
a
moment
that
it
was
the
most
comfortable
room
in
the
world
;
but
she
was
too
guarded
to
say
so
,
and
the
coldness
of
her
praise
disappointed
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
calling
it
a
good
house
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
comparing
it
with
Fullerton
and
Northanger
 
<EOS>
we
are
considering
it
as
a
mere
parsonage
,
small
and
confined
,
we
allow
,
but
decent
,
perhaps
,
and
habitable
;
and
altogether
not
inferior
to
the
generality
;
or
<EOS>
,
in
other
words
,
I
believe
there
are
few
country
parsonages
in
England
half
so
good
.
<EOS>
It
may
admit
of
improvement
,
however
.
<EOS>
Far
be
it
from
me
to
say
otherwise
;
and
anything
in
reason
 
a
bow
thrown
out
,
perhaps
 
though
,
between
ourselves
,
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
my
aversion
,
it
is
a
patched
-
on
bow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
did
not
hear
enough
of
this
speech
to
understand
or
be
pained
by
it
;
and
other
subjects
being
studiously
brought
forward
and
supported
by
Henry
,
at
the
same
time
that
a
tray
full
of
refreshments
was
introduced
by
his
servant
,
the
general
was
shortly
restored
to
his
complacency
,
and
Catherine
to
all
her
usual
ease
of
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
The
room
in
question
was
of
a
commodious
,
well
-
proportioned
size
,
and
handsomely
fitted
up
as
a
dining
-
parlour
;
and
on
their
quitting
it
to
walk
round
the
grounds
,
she
was
shown
,
first
into
a
smaller
apartment
,
belonging
peculiarly
to
the
master
of
the
house
,
and
made
unusually
tidy
on
the
occasion
;
and
afterwards
into
what
was
to
be
the
drawing
-
room
,
with
the
appearance
of
which
,
though
unfurnished
,
Catherine
was
delighted
enough
even
to
satisfy
the
general
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
prettily
shaped
room
,
the
windows
reaching
to
the
ground
,
and
the
view
from
them
pleasant
,
though
only
over
green
meadows
;
and
she
expressed
her
admiration
at
the
moment
with
all
the
honest
simplicity
with
which
she
felt
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Why
do
not
you
fit
up
this
room
,
Mr.
Tilney
?
<EOS>
What
a
pity
not
to
have
it
fitted
up
!
<EOS>
It
is
the
prettiest
room
I
ever
saw
;
it
is
the
prettiest
room
in
the
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
"
said
the
general
,
with
a
most
satisfied
smile
,
"
that
it
will
very
speedily
be
furnished
:
it
waits
only
for
a
lady
's
taste
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
it
was
my
house
,
I
should
never
sit
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
What
a
sweet
little
cottage
there
is
among
the
trees
 
apple
trees
,
too
!
<EOS>
It
is
the
prettiest
cottage
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
like
it
 
<EOS>
you
approve
it
as
an
object
 
<EOS>
it
is
enough
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
remember
that
Robinson
is
spoken
to
about
it
.
<EOS>
The
cottage
remains
.
"
  
<EOS>
Such
a
compliment
recalled
all
Catherine
's
consciousness
,
and
silenced
her
directly
;
and
,
though
pointedly
applied
to
by
the
general
for
her
choice
of
the
prevailing
colour
of
the
paper
and
hangings
,
nothing
like
an
opinion
on
the
subject
could
be
drawn
from
her
.
<EOS>
The
influence
of
fresh
objects
and
fresh
air
,
however
,
was
of
great
use
in
dissipating
these
embarrassing
associations
;
and
,
having
reached
the
ornamental
part
of
the
premises
,
consisting
of
a
walk
round
two
sides
of
a
meadow
,
on
which
Henry
's
genius
had
begun
to
act
about
half
a
year
ago
,
she
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
think
it
prettier
than
any
pleasure
-
ground
she
had
ever
been
in
before
,
though
there
was
not
a
shrub
in
it
higher
than
the
green
bench
in
the
corner
.
  
<EOS>
A
saunter
into
other
meadows
,
and
through
part
of
the
village
,
with
a
visit
to
the
stables
to
examine
some
improvements
,
and
a
charming
game
of
play
with
a
litter
of
puppies
just
able
to
roll
about
,
brought
them
to
four
o'clock
,
when
Catherine
scarcely
thought
it
could
be
three
.
<EOS>
At
four
they
were
to
dine
,
and
at
six
to
set
off
on
their
return
.
<EOS>
Never
had
any
day
passed
so
quickly
!
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
observe
that
the
abundance
of
the
dinner
did
not
seem
to
create
the
smallest
astonishment
in
the
general
;
nay
,
that
he
was
even
looking
at
the
side
-
table
for
cold
meat
which
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
His
son
and
daughter
's
observations
were
of
a
different
kind
.
<EOS>
They
had
seldom
seen
him
eat
so
heartily
at
any
table
but
his
own
,
and
never
before
known
him
so
little
disconcerted
by
the
melted
butter
's
being
oiled
.
  
<EOS>
At
six
o'clock
,
the
general
having
taken
his
coffee
,
the
carriage
again
received
them
;
and
so
gratifying
had
been
the
tenor
of
his
conduct
throughout
the
whole
visit
,
so
well
assured
was
her
mind
on
the
subject
of
his
expectations
,
that
,
could
she
have
felt
equally
confident
of
the
wishes
of
his
son
,
Catherine
would
have
quitted
Woodston
with
little
anxiety
as
to
the
How
or
the
When
she
might
return
to
it
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
morning
brought
the
following
very
unexpected
letter
from
Isabella
:
  
Bath
,
April
  
<EOS>
My
dearest
Catherine
,
I
received
your
two
kind
letters
with
the
greatest
delight
,
and
have
a
thousand
apologies
to
make
for
not
answering
them
sooner
.
<EOS>
I
really
am
quite
ashamed
of
my
idleness
;
but
in
this
horrid
place
one
can
find
time
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
my
pen
in
my
hand
to
begin
a
letter
to
you
almost
every
day
since
you
left
Bath
,
but
have
always
been
prevented
by
some
silly
trifler
or
other
.
<EOS>
Pray
write
to
me
soon
,
and
direct
to
my
own
home
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
we
leave
this
vile
place
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
Since
you
went
away
,
I
have
had
no
pleasure
in
it
 
<EOS>
the
dust
is
beyond
anything
;
and
everybody
one
cares
for
is
gone
.
<EOS>
I
believe
if
I
could
see
you
I
should
not
mind
the
rest
,
for
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
anybody
can
conceive
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
uneasy
about
your
dear
brother
,
not
having
heard
from
him
since
he
went
to
Oxford
;
and
am
fearful
of
some
misunderstanding
.
<EOS>
Your
kind
offices
will
set
all
right
:
he
is
the
only
man
I
ever
did
or
could
love
,
and
I
trust
you
will
convince
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
spring
fashions
are
partly
down
;
and
the
hats
the
most
frightful
you
can
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
spend
your
time
pleasantly
,
but
am
afraid
you
never
think
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
all
that
I
could
of
the
family
you
are
with
,
because
I
would
not
be
ungenerous
,
or
set
you
against
those
you
esteem
;
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
know
whom
to
trust
,
and
young
men
never
know
their
minds
two
days
together
.
<EOS>
I
rejoice
to
say
that
the
young
man
whom
,
of
all
others
,
I
particularly
abhor
,
has
left
Bath
.
<EOS>
You
will
know
,
from
this
description
,
I
must
mean
Captain
Tilney
,
who
,
as
you
may
remember
,
was
amazingly
disposed
to
follow
and
tease
me
,
before
you
went
away
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
he
got
worse
,
and
became
quite
my
shadow
.
<EOS>
Many
girls
might
have
been
taken
in
,
for
never
were
such
attentions
;
but
I
knew
the
fickle
sex
too
well
.
<EOS>
He
went
away
to
his
regiment
two
days
ago
,
and
I
trust
I
shall
never
be
plagued
with
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
greatest
coxcomb
I
ever
saw
,
and
amazingly
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
The
last
two
days
he
was
always
by
the
side
of
Charlotte
Davis
<EOS>
:
I
pitied
his
taste
,
but
took
no
notice
of
him
.
<EOS>
The
last
time
we
met
was
in
Bath
Street
,
and
I
turned
directly
into
a
shop
that
he
might
not
speak
to
me
;
I
would
not
even
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
pump
-
room
afterwards
;
but
I
would
not
have
followed
him
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Such
a
contrast
between
him
and
your
brother
!
<EOS>
Pray
send
me
some
news
of
the
latter
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
unhappy
about
him
;
he
seemed
so
uncomfortable
when
he
went
away
,
with
a
cold
,
or
something
that
affected
his
spirits
.
<EOS>
I
would
write
to
him
myself
,
but
have
mislaid
his
direction
;
and
,
as
I
hinted
above
,
am
afraid
he
took
something
in
my
conduct
amiss
.
<EOS>
Pray
explain
everything
to
his
satisfaction
;
or
,
if
he
still
harbours
any
doubt
,
a
line
from
himself
to
me
,
or
a
call
at
Putney
when
next
in
town
,
might
set
all
to
rights
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
to
the
rooms
this
age
,
nor
to
the
play
,
except
going
in
last
night
with
the
Hodges
,
for
a
frolic
,
at
half
price
:
they
teased
me
into
it
;
and
I
was
determined
they
should
not
say
I
shut
myself
up
because
Tilney
was
gone
.
<EOS>
We
happened
to
sit
by
the
Mitchells
,
and
they
pretended
to
be
quite
surprised
to
see
me
out
.
<EOS>
I
knew
their
spite
:
at
one
time
they
could
not
be
civil
to
me
,
but
now
they
are
all
friendship
;
but
I
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
be
taken
in
by
them
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
a
pretty
good
spirit
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
Anne
Mitchell
had
tried
to
put
on
a
turban
like
mine
,
as
I
wore
it
the
week
before
at
the
concert
,
but
made
wretched
work
of
it
 
<EOS>
it
happened
to
become
my
odd
face
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
at
least
Tilney
told
me
so
at
the
time
,
and
said
every
eye
was
upon
me
;
but
he
is
the
last
man
whose
word
I
would
take
.
<EOS>
I
wear
nothing
but
purple
now
:
<EOS>
I
know
I
look
hideous
in
it
,
but
no
matter
 
it
is
your
dear
brother
's
favourite
colour
.
<EOS>
Lose
no
time
,
my
dearest
,
sweetest
Catherine
,
in
writing
to
him
and
to
me
,
Who
ever
am
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
strain
of
shallow
artifice
could
not
impose
even
upon
Catherine
.
<EOS>
Its
inconsistencies
,
contradictions
,
and
falsehood
struck
her
from
the
very
first
.
<EOS>
She
was
ashamed
of
Isabella
,
and
ashamed
of
having
ever
loved
her
.
<EOS>
Her
professions
of
attachment
were
now
as
disgusting
as
her
excuses
were
empty
,
and
her
demands
impudent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Write
to
James
on
her
behalf
!
<EOS>
No
,
James
should
never
hear
Isabella
's
name
mentioned
by
her
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
Henry
's
arrival
from
Woodston
,
she
made
known
to
him
and
Eleanor
their
brother
's
safety
,
congratulating
them
with
sincerity
on
it
,
and
reading
aloud
the
most
material
passages
of
her
letter
with
strong
indignation
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
finished
it
 
"
So
much
for
Isabella
,
"
she
cried
,
"
and
for
all
our
intimacy
!
<EOS>
She
must
think
me
an
idiot
,
or
she
could
not
have
written
so
;
but
perhaps
this
has
served
to
make
her
character
better
known
to
me
than
mine
is
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
see
what
she
has
been
about
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
vain
coquette
,
and
her
tricks
have
not
answered
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
she
had
ever
any
regard
either
for
James
or
for
me
,
and
I
wish
I
had
never
known
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
soon
be
as
if
you
never
had
,
"
said
Henry
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
but
one
thing
that
I
can
not
understand
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
she
has
had
designs
on
Captain
Tilney
,
which
have
not
succeeded
;
but
I
do
not
understand
what
Captain
Tilney
has
been
about
all
this
time
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
pay
her
such
attentions
as
to
make
her
quarrel
with
my
brother
,
and
then
fly
off
himself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
very
little
to
say
for
Frederick
's
motives
,
such
as
I
believe
them
to
have
been
.
<EOS>
He
has
his
vanities
as
well
as
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
the
chief
difference
is
,
that
,
having
a
stronger
head
,
they
have
not
yet
injured
himself
.
<EOS>
If
the
effect
of
his
behaviour
does
not
justify
him
with
you
,
we
had
better
not
seek
after
the
cause
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
do
not
suppose
he
ever
really
cared
about
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
persuaded
that
he
never
did
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
only
made
believe
to
do
so
for
mischief
's
sake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Henry
bowed
his
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
must
say
that
I
do
not
like
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
Though
it
has
turned
out
so
well
for
us
,
I
do
not
like
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
As
it
happens
,
there
is
no
great
harm
done
,
because
I
do
not
think
Isabella
has
any
heart
to
lose
.
<EOS>
But
,
suppose
he
had
made
her
very
much
in
love
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
first
suppose
Isabella
to
have
had
a
heart
to
lose
 
consequently
to
have
been
a
very
different
creature
;
and
,
in
that
case
,
she
would
have
met
with
very
different
treatment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
right
that
you
should
stand
by
your
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
would
stand
by
yours
,
you
would
not
be
much
distressed
by
the
disappointment
of
Miss
Thorpe
.
<EOS>
But
your
mind
is
warped
by
an
innate
principle
of
general
integrity
,
and
therefore
not
accessible
to
the
cool
reasonings
of
family
partiality
,
or
a
desire
of
revenge
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
was
complimented
out
of
further
bitterness
.
<EOS>
Frederick
could
not
be
unpardonably
guilty
,
while
Henry
made
himself
so
agreeable
.
<EOS>
She
resolved
on
not
answering
Isabella
's
letter
,
and
tried
to
think
no
more
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
the
general
found
himself
obliged
to
go
to
London
for
a
week
;
and
he
left
Northanger
earnestly
regretting
that
any
necessity
should
rob
him
even
for
an
hour
of
Miss
Morland
's
company
,
and
anxiously
recommending
the
study
of
her
comfort
and
amusement
to
his
children
as
their
chief
object
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
His
departure
gave
Catherine
the
first
experimental
conviction
that
a
loss
may
be
sometimes
a
gain
.
<EOS>
The
happiness
with
which
their
time
now
passed
,
every
employment
voluntary
,
every
laugh
indulged
<EOS>
,
every
meal
a
scene
of
ease
and
good
humour
,
walking
where
they
liked
and
when
they
liked
,
their
hours
,
pleasures
,
and
fatigues
at
their
own
command
,
made
her
thoroughly
sensible
of
the
restraint
which
the
general
's
presence
had
imposed
,
and
most
thankfully
feel
their
present
release
from
it
.
<EOS>
Such
ease
and
such
delights
made
her
love
the
place
and
the
people
more
and
more
every
day
;
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
dread
of
its
soon
becoming
expedient
to
leave
the
one
,
and
an
apprehension
of
not
being
equally
beloved
by
the
other
,
she
would
at
each
moment
of
each
day
have
been
perfectly
happy
;
but
she
was
now
in
the
fourth
week
of
her
visit
;
before
the
general
came
home
,
the
fourth
week
would
be
turned
,
and
perhaps
it
might
seem
an
intrusion
if
she
stayed
much
longer
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
painful
consideration
whenever
it
occurred
;
and
eager
to
get
rid
of
such
a
weight
on
her
mind
,
she
very
soon
resolved
to
speak
to
Eleanor
about
it
at
once
,
propose
going
away
,
and
be
guided
in
her
conduct
by
the
manner
in
which
her
proposal
might
be
taken
.
  
<EOS>
Aware
that
if
she
gave
herself
much
time
,
she
might
feel
it
difficult
to
bring
forward
so
unpleasant
a
subject
<EOS>
,
she
took
the
first
opportunity
of
being
suddenly
alone
with
Eleanor
,
and
of
Eleanor
's
being
in
the
middle
of
a
speech
about
something
very
different
,
to
start
forth
her
obligation
of
going
away
very
soon
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
looked
and
declared
herself
much
concerned
.
<EOS>
She
had
"
hoped
for
the
pleasure
of
her
company
for
a
much
longer
time
 
had
been
misled
(
perhaps
by
her
wishes
)
to
suppose
that
a
much
longer
visit
had
been
promised
 
and
could
not
but
think
that
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
were
aware
of
the
pleasure
it
was
to
her
to
have
her
there
,
they
would
be
too
generous
to
hasten
her
return
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
explained
:
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
As
to
that
,
Papa
and
Mamma
were
in
no
hurry
at
all
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
she
was
happy
,
they
would
always
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
,
might
she
ask
,
in
such
a
hurry
herself
to
leave
them
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Because
she
had
been
there
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
if
you
can
use
such
a
word
,
I
can
urge
you
no
farther
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
it
long
 
"
  
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
not
indeed
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
pleasure
,
I
could
stay
with
you
as
long
again
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
was
directly
settled
that
,
till
she
had
,
her
leaving
them
was
not
even
to
be
thought
of
.
<EOS>
In
having
this
cause
of
uneasiness
so
pleasantly
removed
,
the
force
of
the
other
was
likewise
weakened
.
<EOS>
The
kindness
,
the
earnestness
of
Eleanor
's
manner
in
pressing
her
to
stay
,
and
Henry
's
gratified
look
on
being
told
that
her
stay
was
determined
,
were
such
sweet
proofs
of
her
importance
with
them
,
as
left
her
only
just
so
much
solicitude
as
the
human
mind
can
never
do
comfortably
without
.
<EOS>
She
did
 
<EOS>
almost
always
 
believe
that
Henry
loved
her
,
and
quite
always
that
his
father
and
sister
loved
and
even
wished
her
to
belong
to
them
;
and
believing
so
far
,
her
doubts
and
anxieties
were
merely
sportive
irritations
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
was
not
able
to
obey
his
father
's
injunction
of
remaining
wholly
at
Northanger
in
attendance
on
the
ladies
,
during
his
absence
in
London
,
the
engagements
of
his
curate
at
Woodston
obliging
him
to
leave
them
on
Saturday
for
a
couple
of
nights
.
<EOS>
His
loss
was
not
now
what
it
had
been
while
the
general
was
at
home
;
it
lessened
their
gaiety
,
but
did
not
ruin
their
comfort
;
and
the
two
girls
agreeing
in
occupation
,
and
improving
in
intimacy
,
found
themselves
so
well
sufficient
for
the
time
to
themselves
,
that
it
was
eleven
o'clock
,
rather
a
late
hour
at
the
abbey
,
before
they
quitted
the
supper
-
room
on
the
day
of
Henry
's
departure
.
<EOS>
They
had
just
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
when
it
seemed
,
as
far
as
the
thickness
of
the
walls
would
allow
them
to
judge
,
that
a
carriage
was
driving
up
to
the
door
,
and
the
next
moment
confirmed
the
idea
by
the
loud
noise
of
the
house
-
bell
.
<EOS>
After
the
first
perturbation
of
surprise
had
passed
away
,
in
a
"
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
What
can
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
it
was
quickly
decided
by
Eleanor
to
be
her
eldest
brother
,
whose
arrival
was
often
as
sudden
,
if
not
quite
so
unseasonable
,
and
accordingly
she
hurried
down
to
welcome
him
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
walked
on
to
her
chamber
,
making
up
her
mind
as
well
as
she
could
,
to
a
further
acquaintance
with
Captain
Tilney
,
and
comforting
herself
under
the
unpleasant
impression
his
conduct
had
given
her
,
and
the
persuasion
of
his
being
by
far
too
fine
a
gentleman
to
approve
of
her
,
that
at
least
they
should
not
meet
under
such
circumstances
as
would
make
their
meeting
materially
painful
.
<EOS>
She
trusted
he
would
never
speak
of
Miss
Thorpe
;
and
indeed
,
as
he
must
by
this
time
be
ashamed
of
the
part
he
had
acted
,
there
could
be
no
danger
of
it
;
and
as
long
as
all
mention
of
Bath
scenes
were
avoided
,
she
thought
she
could
behave
to
him
very
civilly
.
<EOS>
In
such
considerations
time
passed
away
,
and
it
was
certainly
in
his
favour
that
Eleanor
should
be
so
glad
to
see
him
,
and
have
so
much
to
say
,
for
half
an
hour
was
almost
gone
since
his
arrival
,
and
Eleanor
did
not
come
up
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
Catherine
thought
she
heard
her
step
in
the
gallery
,
and
listened
for
its
continuance
;
but
all
was
silent
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
,
however
,
had
she
convicted
her
fancy
of
error
,
when
the
noise
of
something
moving
close
to
her
door
made
her
start
;
it
seemed
as
if
someone
was
touching
the
very
doorway
 
and
in
another
moment
a
slight
motion
of
the
lock
proved
that
some
hand
must
be
on
it
.
<EOS>
She
trembled
a
little
at
the
idea
of
anyone
's
approaching
so
cautiously
;
but
resolving
not
to
be
again
overcome
by
trivial
appearances
of
alarm
,
or
misled
by
a
raised
imagination
,
she
stepped
quietly
forward
,
and
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
and
only
Eleanor
,
stood
there
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
spirits
,
however
,
were
tranquillized
but
for
an
instant
,
for
Eleanor
's
cheeks
were
pale
,
and
her
manner
greatly
agitated
.
<EOS>
Though
evidently
intending
to
come
in
,
it
seemed
an
effort
to
enter
the
room
,
and
a
still
greater
to
speak
when
there
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
supposing
some
uneasiness
on
Captain
Tilney
's
account
,
could
only
express
her
concern
by
silent
attention
,
obliged
her
to
be
seated
,
rubbed
her
temples
with
lavender
-
water
,
and
hung
over
her
with
affectionate
solicitude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Catherine
,
you
must
not
 
you
must
not
indeed
 
"
were
Eleanor
's
first
connected
words
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
well
.
<EOS>
This
kindness
distracts
me
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
it
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
you
on
such
an
errand
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Errand
!
<EOS>
To
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
shall
I
tell
you
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
How
shall
I
tell
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
new
idea
now
darted
into
Catherine
's
mind
,
and
turning
as
pale
as
her
friend
,
she
exclaimed
,
"
'
tis
a
messenger
from
Woodston
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
indeed
,
"
returned
Eleanor
,
looking
at
her
most
compassionately
;
"
it
is
no
one
from
Woodston
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
father
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Her
voice
faltered
,
and
her
eyes
were
turned
to
the
ground
as
she
mentioned
his
name
.
<EOS>
His
unlooked
-
for
return
was
enough
in
itself
to
make
Catherine
's
heart
sink
,
and
for
a
few
moments
she
hardly
supposed
there
were
anything
worse
to
be
told
.
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
;
and
Eleanor
,
endeavouring
to
collect
herself
and
speak
with
firmness
,
but
with
eyes
still
cast
down
,
soon
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
good
,
I
am
sure
,
to
think
the
worse
of
me
for
the
part
I
am
obliged
to
perform
.
<EOS>
I
am
indeed
a
most
unwilling
messenger
.
<EOS>
After
what
has
so
lately
passed
,
so
lately
been
settled
between
us
 
<EOS>
how
joyfully
,
how
thankfully
on
my
side
!
 
<EOS>
as
to
your
continuing
here
as
I
hoped
for
many
,
many
weeks
longer
,
how
can
I
tell
you
that
your
kindness
is
not
to
be
accepted
 
and
that
the
happiness
your
company
has
hitherto
given
us
is
to
be
repaid
by
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
trust
myself
with
words
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Catherine
,
we
are
to
part
.
<EOS>
My
father
has
recollected
an
engagement
that
takes
our
whole
family
away
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
We
are
going
to
Lord
Longtown
's
,
near
Hereford
,
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Explanation
and
apology
are
equally
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
attempt
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Eleanor
,
"
cried
Catherine
,
suppressing
her
feelings
as
well
as
she
could
,
"
do
not
be
so
distressed
.
<EOS>
A
second
engagement
must
give
way
to
a
first
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
we
are
to
part
 
so
soon
,
and
so
suddenly
too
;
but
I
am
not
offended
,
indeed
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
I
can
finish
my
visit
here
,
you
know
,
at
any
time
;
or
I
hope
you
will
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
Can
you
,
when
you
return
from
this
lord
's
,
come
to
Fullerton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
in
my
power
,
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
when
you
can
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
made
no
answer
;
and
Catherine
's
thoughts
recurring
to
something
more
directly
interesting
,
she
added
,
thinking
aloud
,
"
<EOS>
Monday
 
so
soon
as
Monday
;
and
you
all
go
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
am
certain
of
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
able
to
take
leave
,
however
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
go
till
just
before
you
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Do
not
be
distressed
,
Eleanor
,
I
can
go
on
Monday
very
well
.
<EOS>
My
father
and
mother
's
having
no
notice
of
it
is
of
very
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
general
will
send
a
servant
with
me
,
I
dare
say
,
half
the
way
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
shall
soon
be
at
Salisbury
,
<EOS>
and
then
I
am
only
nine
miles
from
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Catherine
!
<EOS>
Were
it
settled
so
<EOS>
,
it
would
be
somewhat
less
intolerable
,
though
in
such
common
attentions
you
would
have
received
but
half
what
you
ought
.
<EOS>
But
 
how
can
I
tell
you
?
 
<EOS>
tomorrow
morning
is
fixed
for
your
leaving
us
,
and
not
even
the
hour
is
left
to
your
choice
;
the
very
carriage
is
ordered
,
and
will
be
here
at
seven
o'clock
,
and
no
servant
will
be
offered
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
sat
down
,
breathless
and
speechless
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
hardly
believe
my
senses
,
when
I
heard
it
;
and
no
displeasure
,
no
resentment
that
you
can
feel
at
this
moment
,
however
justly
great
,
can
be
more
than
I
myself
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
talk
of
what
I
felt
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
That
I
could
suggest
anything
in
extenuation
!
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
What
will
your
father
and
mother
say
!
<EOS>
After
courting
you
from
the
protection
of
real
friends
to
this
 
almost
double
distance
from
your
home
,
to
have
you
driven
out
of
the
house
,
without
the
considerations
even
of
decent
civility
!
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
Catherine
,
in
being
the
bearer
of
such
a
message
,
I
seem
guilty
myself
of
all
its
insult
;
yet
,
I
trust
you
will
acquit
me
,
for
you
must
have
been
long
enough
in
this
house
to
see
that
I
am
but
a
nominal
mistress
of
it
,
that
my
real
power
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
offended
the
general
?
"
said
Catherine
in
a
faltering
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
For
my
feelings
as
a
daughter
,
all
that
I
know
,
all
that
I
answer
for
,
is
that
you
can
have
given
him
no
just
cause
of
offence
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
is
greatly
,
very
greatly
discomposed
;
I
have
seldom
seen
him
more
so
.
<EOS>
His
temper
is
not
happy
,
and
something
has
now
occurred
to
ruffle
it
in
an
uncommon
degree
;
some
disappointment
,
some
vexation
,
which
just
at
this
moment
seems
important
,
but
which
I
can
hardly
suppose
you
to
have
any
concern
in
,
for
how
is
it
possible

"
  
<EOS>
It
was
with
pain
that
Catherine
could
speak
at
all
;
and
it
was
only
for
Eleanor
's
sake
that
she
attempted
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
am
very
sorry
if
I
have
offended
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
thing
I
would
willingly
have
done
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
be
unhappy
,
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
An
engagement
,
you
know
,
must
be
kept
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
sorry
it
was
not
recollected
sooner
,
that
I
might
have
written
home
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
of
very
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
I
earnestly
hope
,
that
to
your
real
safety
it
will
be
of
none
;
but
to
everything
else
it
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
:
to
comfort
,
appearance
,
propriety
,
to
your
family
,
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
Were
your
friends
,
the
Allens
,
still
in
Bath
,
you
might
go
to
them
with
comparative
ease
;
a
few
hours
would
take
you
there
;
but
a
journey
of
seventy
miles
,
to
be
taken
post
by
you
,
at
your
age
,
alone
,
unattended
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
journey
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
Do
not
think
about
that
.
<EOS>
And
if
we
are
to
part
,
a
few
hours
sooner
or
later
,
you
know
,
makes
no
difference
.
<EOS>
I
can
be
ready
by
seven
.
<EOS>
Let
me
be
called
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
saw
that
she
wished
to
be
alone
;
and
believing
it
better
for
each
that
they
should
avoid
any
further
conversation
,
now
left
her
with
,
"
I
shall
see
you
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
Catherine
's
swelling
heart
needed
relief
.
<EOS>
In
Eleanor
's
presence
friendship
and
pride
had
equally
restrained
her
tears
,
but
no
sooner
was
she
gone
than
they
burst
forth
in
torrents
.
<EOS>
Turned
from
the
house
,
and
in
such
a
way
!
<EOS>
Without
any
reason
that
could
justify
,
any
apology
that
could
atone
for
the
abruptness
,
the
rudeness
,
nay
,
the
insolence
of
it
.
<EOS>
Henry
at
a
distance
 
not
able
even
to
bid
him
farewell
.
<EOS>
Every
hope
,
every
expectation
from
him
suspended
,
at
least
,
and
who
could
say
how
long
?
<EOS>
Who
could
say
when
they
might
meet
again
?
<EOS>
And
all
this
by
such
a
man
as
General
Tilney
,
so
polite
,
so
well
bred
,
and
heretofore
so
particularly
fond
of
her
!
<EOS>
It
was
as
incomprehensible
as
it
was
mortifying
and
grievous
.
<EOS>
From
what
it
could
arise
,
and
where
it
would
end
,
were
considerations
of
equal
perplexity
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
it
was
done
so
grossly
uncivil
,
hurrying
her
away
without
any
reference
to
her
own
convenience
,
or
allowing
her
even
the
appearance
of
choice
as
to
the
time
or
mode
of
her
travelling
;
of
two
days
,
the
earliest
fixed
on
,
and
of
that
almost
the
earliest
hour
,
as
if
resolved
to
have
her
gone
before
he
was
stirring
in
the
morning
,
that
he
might
not
be
obliged
even
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
What
could
all
this
mean
but
<EOS>
an
intentional
affront
?
<EOS>
By
some
means
or
other
she
must
have
had
the
misfortune
to
offend
him
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
wished
to
spare
her
from
so
painful
a
notion
,
but
Catherine
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
any
injury
or
any
misfortune
could
provoke
such
ill
will
against
a
person
not
connected
,
or
,
at
least
,
not
supposed
to
be
connected
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
Heavily
passed
the
night
.
<EOS>
Sleep
,
or
repose
that
deserved
the
name
of
sleep
,
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
That
room
,
in
which
her
disturbed
imagination
had
tormented
her
on
her
first
arrival
,
was
again
the
scene
of
agitated
spirits
and
unquiet
slumbers
.
<EOS>
Yet
how
different
now
the
source
of
her
inquietude
from
what
it
had
been
then
 
how
mournfully
superior
in
reality
and
substance
!
<EOS>
Her
anxiety
had
foundation
in
fact
,
her
fears
in
probability
;
and
with
a
mind
so
occupied
in
the
contemplation
of
actual
and
natural
evil
,
the
solitude
of
her
situation
,
the
darkness
of
her
chamber
,
the
antiquity
of
the
building
,
were
felt
and
considered
without
the
smallest
emotion
;
and
though
the
wind
was
high
,
and
often
produced
strange
and
sudden
noises
throughout
the
house
,
she
heard
it
all
as
she
lay
awake
,
hour
after
hour
,
without
curiosity
or
terror
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
six
Eleanor
entered
her
room
,
eager
to
show
attention
or
give
assistance
where
it
was
possible
;
but
very
little
remained
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Catherine
had
not
loitered
;
she
was
almost
dressed
,
and
her
packing
almost
finished
.
<EOS>
The
possibility
of
some
conciliatory
message
from
the
general
occurred
to
her
as
his
daughter
appeared
.
<EOS>
What
so
natural
,
as
that
anger
should
pass
away
and
repentance
succeed
it
?
<EOS>
And
she
only
wanted
to
know
how
far
,
after
what
had
passed
,
an
apology
might
properly
be
received
by
her
.
<EOS>
But
the
knowledge
would
have
been
useless
here
;
it
was
not
called
for
;
neither
clemency
nor
dignity
was
put
to
the
trial
 
Eleanor
brought
no
message
.
<EOS>
Very
little
passed
between
them
on
meeting
;
each
found
her
greatest
safety
in
silence
,
and
few
and
trivial
were
the
sentences
exchanged
while
they
remained
upstairs
,
Catherine
in
busy
agitation
completing
her
dress
,
and
Eleanor
with
more
goodwill
than
experience
intent
upon
filling
the
trunk
.
<EOS>
When
everything
was
done
they
left
the
room
,
Catherine
lingering
only
half
a
minute
behind
her
friend
to
throw
a
parting
glance
on
every
well
-
known
,
cherished
object
,
and
went
down
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
where
breakfast
was
prepared
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
eat
,
as
well
to
save
herself
from
the
pain
of
being
urged
as
to
make
her
friend
comfortable
;
but
she
had
no
appetite
,
and
could
not
swallow
many
mouthfuls
.
<EOS>
The
contrast
between
this
and
her
last
breakfast
in
that
room
gave
her
fresh
misery
,
and
strengthened
her
distaste
for
everything
before
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
four
and
twenty
hours
ago
since
they
had
met
there
to
the
same
repast
,
but
in
circumstances
how
different
!
<EOS>
With
what
cheerful
ease
,
what
happy
,
though
false
,
security
,
had
she
then
looked
around
her
,
enjoying
everything
present
,
and
fearing
little
in
future
,
beyond
Henry
's
going
to
Woodston
for
a
day
!
<EOS>
Happy
,
happy
breakfast
!
<EOS>
For
Henry
had
been
there
;
Henry
had
sat
by
her
and
helped
her
.
<EOS>
These
reflections
were
long
indulged
undisturbed
by
any
address
from
her
companion
,
who
sat
as
deep
in
thought
as
herself
;
and
the
appearance
of
the
carriage
was
the
first
thing
to
startle
and
recall
them
to
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
Catherine
's
colour
rose
at
the
sight
of
it
;
and
the
indignity
with
which
she
was
treated
,
striking
at
that
instant
on
her
mind
with
peculiar
force
,
made
her
for
a
short
time
sensible
only
of
resentment
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
seemed
now
impelled
into
resolution
and
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
write
to
me
,
Catherine
,
"
she
cried
;
"
you
must
let
me
hear
from
you
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Till
I
know
you
to
be
safe
at
home
,
I
shall
not
have
an
hour
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
For
one
letter
,
at
all
risks
,
all
hazards
,
I
must
entreat
.
<EOS>
Let
me
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
are
safe
at
Fullerton
,
and
have
found
your
family
well
,
and
then
,
till
I
can
ask
for
your
correspondence
as
I
ought
to
do
,
I
will
not
expect
more
.
<EOS>
Direct
to
me
at
Lord
Longtown
's
,
and
,
I
must
ask
it
,
under
cover
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Eleanor
,
if
you
are
not
allowed
to
receive
a
letter
from
me
,
I
am
sure
I
had
better
not
write
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
my
getting
home
safe
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
only
replied
,
"
I
can
not
wonder
at
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
importune
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
trust
to
your
own
kindness
of
heart
when
I
am
at
a
distance
from
you
.
"
<EOS>
But
this
,
with
the
look
of
sorrow
accompanying
it
,
was
enough
to
melt
Catherine
's
pride
in
a
moment
,
and
she
instantly
said
,
"
Oh
,
Eleanor
,
I
will
write
to
you
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
yet
another
point
which
Miss
Tilney
was
anxious
to
settle
,
though
somewhat
embarrassed
in
speaking
of
.
<EOS>
It
had
occurred
to
her
that
after
so
long
an
absence
from
home
,
Catherine
might
not
be
provided
with
money
enough
for
the
expenses
of
her
journey
,
and
,
upon
suggesting
it
to
her
with
most
affectionate
offers
of
accommodation
,
it
proved
to
be
exactly
the
case
.
<EOS>
Catherine
had
never
thought
on
the
subject
till
that
moment
,
but
,
upon
examining
her
purse
,
was
convinced
that
but
for
this
kindness
of
her
friend
,
she
might
have
been
turned
from
the
house
without
even
the
means
of
getting
home
;
and
the
distress
in
which
she
must
have
been
thereby
involved
filling
the
minds
of
both
,
scarcely
another
word
was
said
by
either
during
the
time
of
their
remaining
together
.
<EOS>
Short
,
however
,
was
that
time
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
soon
announced
to
be
ready
;
and
Catherine
,
instantly
rising
,
a
long
and
affectionate
embrace
supplied
the
place
of
language
in
bidding
each
other
adieu
;
and
,
as
they
entered
the
hall
,
unable
to
leave
the
house
without
some
mention
of
one
whose
name
had
not
yet
been
spoken
by
either
<EOS>
,
she
paused
a
moment
,
and
with
quivering
lips
just
made
it
intelligible
that
she
left
"
her
kind
remembrance
for
her
absent
friend
.
<EOS>
"
But
with
this
approach
to
his
name
ended
all
possibility
of
restraining
her
feelings
;
and
,
hiding
her
face
as
well
as
she
could
with
her
handkerchief
<EOS>
,
she
darted
across
the
hall
,
jumped
into
the
chaise
,
and
in
a
moment
was
driven
from
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
Catherine
was
too
wretched
to
be
fearful
.
<EOS>
The
journey
in
itself
had
no
terrors
for
her
;
and
she
began
it
without
either
dreading
its
length
or
feeling
its
solitariness
.
<EOS>
Leaning
back
in
one
corner
of
the
carriage
,
in
a
violent
burst
of
tears
,
she
was
conveyed
some
miles
beyond
the
walls
of
the
abbey
before
she
raised
her
head
;
and
the
highest
point
of
ground
within
the
park
was
almost
closed
from
her
view
before
she
was
capable
of
turning
her
eyes
towards
it
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
the
road
she
now
travelled
was
the
same
which
only
ten
days
ago
she
had
so
happily
passed
along
in
going
to
and
from
Woodston
;
and
,
for
fourteen
miles
,
every
bitter
feeling
was
rendered
more
severe
by
the
review
of
objects
on
which
she
had
first
looked
under
impressions
so
different
.
<EOS>
Every
mile
,
as
it
brought
her
nearer
Woodston
,
added
to
her
sufferings
,
and
when
within
the
distance
of
five
,
she
passed
the
turning
which
led
to
it
,
and
thought
of
Henry
,
so
near
,
yet
so
unconscious
,
her
grief
and
agitation
were
excessive
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
which
she
had
spent
at
that
place
had
been
one
of
the
happiest
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
there
,
it
was
on
that
day
,
that
the
general
had
made
use
of
such
expressions
with
regard
to
Henry
and
herself
,
had
so
spoken
and
so
looked
as
to
give
her
the
most
positive
conviction
of
his
actually
wishing
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
only
ten
days
ago
had
he
elated
her
by
his
pointed
regard
 
<EOS>
had
he
even
confused
her
by
his
too
significant
reference
!
<EOS>
And
now
 
what
had
she
done
,
or
what
had
she
omitted
to
do
,
to
merit
such
a
change
?
  
<EOS>
The
only
offence
against
him
of
which
she
could
accuse
herself
had
been
such
as
was
scarcely
possible
to
reach
his
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Henry
and
her
own
heart
only
were
privy
to
the
shocking
suspicions
which
she
had
so
idly
entertained
;
and
equally
safe
<EOS>
did
she
believe
her
secret
with
each
.
<EOS>
Designedly
,
at
least
,
Henry
could
not
have
betrayed
her
.
<EOS>
If
,
indeed
,
by
any
strange
mischance
his
father
should
have
gained
intelligence
of
what
she
had
dared
to
think
and
look
for
,
of
her
causeless
fancies
and
injurious
examinations
,
she
could
not
wonder
at
any
degree
of
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
If
aware
of
her
having
viewed
him
as
a
murderer
,
she
could
not
wonder
at
his
even
turning
her
from
his
house
.
<EOS>
But
a
justification
so
full
of
torture
to
herself
,
she
trusted
,
would
not
be
in
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
Anxious
as
were
all
her
conjectures
on
this
point
,
it
was
not
,
however
,
the
one
on
which
she
dwelt
most
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
thought
yet
nearer
,
a
more
prevailing
,
more
impetuous
concern
.
<EOS>
How
Henry
would
think
,
and
feel
,
and
look
,
when
he
returned
on
the
morrow
to
Northanger
and
heard
of
her
being
gone
,
was
a
question
of
force
and
interest
to
rise
over
every
other
,
to
be
never
ceasing
,
alternately
irritating
and
soothing
;
it
sometimes
suggested
the
dread
of
his
calm
acquiescence
,
and
at
others
was
answered
by
the
sweetest
confidence
in
his
regret
and
resentment
.
<EOS>
To
the
general
,
of
course
,
he
would
not
dare
to
speak
;
but
to
Eleanor
 
<EOS>
what
might
he
not
say
to
Eleanor
about
her
?
  
<EOS>
In
this
unceasing
recurrence
of
doubts
and
inquiries
,
on
any
one
article
of
which
her
mind
was
incapable
of
more
than
momentary
repose
,
the
hours
passed
away
,
and
her
journey
advanced
much
faster
than
she
looked
for
.
<EOS>
The
pressing
anxieties
of
thought
,
which
prevented
her
from
noticing
anything
before
her
,
when
once
beyond
the
neighbourhood
of
Woodston
,
saved
her
at
the
same
time
from
watching
her
progress
;
and
though
no
object
on
the
road
could
engage
a
moment
's
attention
,
she
found
no
stage
of
it
tedious
.
<EOS>
From
this
,
she
was
preserved
too
by
another
cause
,
by
feeling
no
eagerness
for
her
journey
's
conclusion
;
for
to
return
in
such
a
manner
to
Fullerton
was
almost
to
destroy
the
pleasure
of
a
meeting
with
those
she
loved
best
,
even
after
an
absence
such
as
hers
 
an
eleven
weeks
'
absence
.
<EOS>
What
had
she
to
say
that
would
not
humble
herself
and
pain
her
family
,
that
would
not
increase
her
own
grief
by
the
confession
of
it
,
extend
an
useless
resentment
,
and
perhaps
involve
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
in
undistinguishing
ill
will
?
<EOS>
She
could
never
do
justice
to
Henry
and
Eleanor
's
merit
;
she
felt
it
too
strongly
for
expression
;
and
should
a
dislike
be
taken
against
them
,
should
they
be
thought
of
unfavourably
,
on
their
father
's
account
,
it
would
cut
her
to
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
With
these
feelings
,
she
rather
dreaded
than
sought
for
the
first
view
of
that
well
-
known
spire
which
would
announce
her
within
twenty
miles
of
home
.
<EOS>
Salisbury
she
had
known
to
be
her
point
on
leaving
Northanger
;
but
after
the
first
stage
she
had
been
indebted
to
the
post
-
masters
for
the
names
of
the
places
which
were
then
to
conduct
her
to
it
;
so
great
had
been
her
ignorance
of
her
route
.
<EOS>
She
met
with
nothing
,
however
,
to
distress
or
frighten
her
.
<EOS>
Her
youth
,
civil
manners
,
and
liberal
pay
procured
her
all
the
attention
that
a
traveller
like
herself
could
require
;
and
stopping
only
to
change
horses
,
she
travelled
on
for
about
eleven
hours
without
accident
or
alarm
,
and
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
found
herself
entering
Fullerton
.
  
<EOS>
A
heroine
returning
,
at
the
close
of
her
career
,
to
her
native
village
,
in
all
the
triumph
of
recovered
reputation
,
and
all
the
dignity
of
a
countess
,
with
a
long
train
of
noble
relations
in
their
several
phaetons
,
and
three
waiting
-
maids
in
a
travelling
chaise
and
four
,
behind
her
,
is
an
event
on
which
the
pen
of
the
contriver
may
well
delight
to
dwell
;
it
gives
credit
to
every
conclusion
,
and
the
author
must
share
in
the
glory
she
so
liberally
bestows
.
<EOS>
But
my
affair
is
widely
different
;
I
bring
back
my
heroine
to
her
home
in
solitude
and
disgrace
;
and
no
sweet
elation
of
spirits
can
lead
me
into
minuteness
.
<EOS>
A
heroine
in
a
hack
post
-
chaise
is
such
a
blow
upon
sentiment
,
as
no
attempt
at
grandeur
or
pathos
can
withstand
.
<EOS>
Swiftly
therefore
shall
her
post
-
boy
drive
through
the
village
,
amid
the
gaze
of
Sunday
groups
,
and
speedy
shall
be
her
descent
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
whatever
might
be
the
distress
of
Catherine
's
mind
,
as
she
thus
advanced
towards
the
parsonage
,
and
whatever
the
humiliation
of
her
biographer
in
relating
it
,
she
was
preparing
enjoyment
of
no
everyday
nature
for
those
to
whom
she
went
;
first
,
in
the
appearance
of
her
carriage
 
and
secondly
,
in
herself
.
<EOS>
The
chaise
of
a
traveller
being
a
rare
sight
in
Fullerton
,
the
whole
family
were
immediately
at
the
window
;
and
to
have
it
stop
at
the
sweep
-
gate
was
a
pleasure
to
brighten
every
eye
and
occupy
every
fancy
 
a
pleasure
quite
unlooked
for
by
all
but
the
two
youngest
children
,
a
boy
and
girl
of
six
and
four
years
old
,
who
expected
a
brother
or
sister
in
every
carriage
.
<EOS>
Happy
the
glance
that
first
distinguished
Catherine
!
<EOS>
Happy
the
voice
that
proclaimed
the
discovery
!
<EOS>
But
whether
such
happiness
were
the
lawful
property
of
George
or
Harriet
could
never
be
exactly
understood
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
,
mother
,
Sarah
,
George
,
and
Harriet
,
all
assembled
at
the
door
to
welcome
her
with
affectionate
eagerness
,
was
a
sight
to
awaken
the
best
feelings
of
Catherine
's
heart
;
and
in
the
embrace
of
each
,
as
she
stepped
from
the
carriage
,
she
found
herself
soothed
beyond
anything
that
she
had
believed
possible
.
<EOS>
So
surrounded
,
so
caressed
,
she
was
even
happy
!
<EOS>
In
the
joyfulness
of
family
love
everything
for
a
short
time
was
subdued
,
and
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
,
leaving
them
at
first
little
leisure
for
calm
curiosity
,
they
were
all
seated
round
the
tea
-
table
,
which
Mrs.
Morland
had
hurried
for
the
comfort
of
the
poor
traveller
,
<EOS>
whose
pale
and
jaded
looks
soon
caught
her
notice
,
before
any
inquiry
so
direct
as
to
demand
a
positive
answer
was
addressed
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Reluctantly
,
and
with
much
hesitation
,
did
she
then
begin
what
might
perhaps
,
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
,
be
termed
,
by
the
courtesy
of
her
hearers
,
an
explanation
;
but
scarcely
,
within
that
time
,
could
they
at
all
discover
the
cause
,
or
collect
the
particulars
,
of
her
sudden
return
.
<EOS>
They
were
far
from
being
an
irritable
race
;
far
from
any
quickness
in
catching
,
or
bitterness
in
resenting
,
affronts
:
but
here
,
when
the
whole
was
unfolded
,
was
an
insult
not
to
be
overlooked
,
nor
,
for
the
first
half
hour
,
to
be
easily
pardoned
.
<EOS>
Without
suffering
any
romantic
alarm
,
in
the
consideration
of
their
daughter
's
long
and
lonely
journey
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
could
not
but
feel
that
it
might
have
been
productive
of
much
unpleasantness
to
her
;
that
it
was
what
they
could
never
have
voluntarily
suffered
;
and
that
,
in
forcing
her
on
such
a
measure
,
General
Tilney
had
acted
neither
honourably
nor
feelingly
 
neither
as
a
gentleman
nor
as
a
parent
.
<EOS>
Why
he
had
done
it
,
what
could
have
provoked
him
to
such
a
breach
of
hospitality
,
and
so
suddenly
turned
all
his
partial
regard
for
their
daughter
into
actual
ill
will
,
was
a
matter
which
they
were
at
least
as
far
from
divining
as
Catherine
herself
;
but
it
did
not
oppress
them
by
any
means
so
long
;
and
,
after
a
due
course
of
useless
conjecture
,
that
"
it
was
a
strange
business
,
and
that
he
must
be
a
very
strange
man
,
"
grew
enough
for
all
their
indignation
and
wonder
;
though
Sarah
indeed
still
indulged
in
the
sweets
of
incomprehensibility
,
exclaiming
and
conjecturing
with
youthful
ardour
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
give
yourself
a
great
deal
of
needless
trouble
,
"
said
her
mother
at
last
;
"
depend
upon
it
,
<EOS>
it
is
something
not
at
all
worth
understanding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
allow
for
his
wishing
Catherine
away
,
when
he
recollected
this
engagement
,
"
said
Sarah
,
"
but
why
not
do
it
civilly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
the
young
people
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Morland
;
"
they
must
have
a
sad
time
of
it
;
but
as
for
anything
else
,
it
is
no
matter
now
;
Catherine
is
safe
at
home
,
and
our
comfort
does
not
depend
upon
General
Tilney
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
sighed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
continued
her
philosophic
mother
,
"
I
am
glad
I
did
not
know
of
your
journey
at
the
time
;
but
now
it
is
all
over
,
perhaps
there
is
no
great
harm
done
.
<EOS>
It
is
always
good
for
young
people
to
be
put
upon
exerting
themselves
;
and
you
know
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
you
always
were
a
sad
little
scatter
-
brained
creature
;
but
now
you
must
have
been
forced
to
have
your
wits
about
you
,
with
so
much
changing
of
chaises
and
so
forth
;
and
I
hope
it
will
appear
that
you
have
not
left
anything
behind
you
in
any
of
the
pockets
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
hoped
so
too
,
and
tried
to
feel
an
interest
in
her
own
amendment
,
but
her
spirits
were
quite
worn
down
;
and
,
to
be
silent
and
alone
becoming
soon
<EOS>
her
only
wish
<EOS>
,
she
readily
agreed
to
her
mother
's
next
counsel
of
going
early
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Her
parents
,
seeing
nothing
in
her
ill
looks
and
agitation
but
the
natural
consequence
of
mortified
feelings
,
and
of
the
unusual
exertion
and
fatigue
of
such
a
journey
,
parted
from
her
without
any
doubt
of
their
being
soon
slept
away
;
and
though
,
when
they
all
met
the
next
morning
,
her
recovery
was
not
equal
to
their
hopes
,
they
were
still
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
there
being
any
deeper
evil
.
<EOS>
They
never
once
thought
of
her
heart
,
which
,
for
the
parents
of
a
young
lady
of
seventeen
,
just
returned
from
her
first
excursion
from
home
,
was
odd
enough
!
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
,
she
sat
down
to
fulfil
her
promise
to
Miss
Tilney
,
whose
trust
in
the
effect
of
time
and
distance
on
her
friend
's
disposition
was
already
justified
,
for
already
did
Catherine
reproach
herself
with
having
parted
from
Eleanor
coldly
,
with
having
never
enough
valued
her
merits
or
kindness
,
and
never
enough
commiserated
her
for
what
she
had
been
yesterday
left
to
endure
.
<EOS>
The
strength
of
these
feelings
,
however
,
was
far
from
assisting
her
pen
;
and
never
had
it
been
harder
for
her
to
write
than
in
addressing
Eleanor
Tilney
.
<EOS>
To
compose
a
letter
which
might
at
once
do
justice
to
her
sentiments
and
her
situation
,
convey
gratitude
without
servile
regret
,
be
guarded
without
coldness
,
and
honest
without
resentment
 
<EOS>
a
letter
which
Eleanor
might
not
be
pained
by
the
perusal
of
 
and
,
above
all
,
which
she
might
not
blush
herself
,
if
Henry
should
chance
to
see
,
was
an
undertaking
to
frighten
away
all
her
powers
of
performance
;
and
,
after
long
thought
and
much
perplexity
,
to
be
very
brief
was
all
that
she
could
determine
on
with
any
confidence
of
safety
.
<EOS>
The
money
therefore
which
Eleanor
had
advanced
was
enclosed
with
little
more
than
grateful
thanks
,
and
the
thousand
good
wishes
of
a
most
affectionate
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
has
been
a
strange
acquaintance
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Morland
,
as
the
letter
was
finished
;
"
soon
made
and
soon
ended
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
it
happens
so
,
for
Mrs.
Allen
thought
them
very
pretty
kind
of
young
people
;
and
you
were
sadly
out
of
luck
too
in
your
Isabella
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Poor
James
!
<EOS>
Well
,
we
must
live
and
learn
;
and
the
next
new
friends
you
make
I
hope
will
be
better
worth
keeping
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
coloured
as
she
warmly
answered
,
"
No
friend
can
be
better
worth
keeping
than
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
my
dear
,
I
dare
say
you
will
meet
again
some
time
or
other
;
do
not
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
It
is
ten
to
one
but
you
are
thrown
together
again
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
;
and
then
what
a
pleasure
it
will
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Morland
was
not
happy
in
her
attempt
at
consolation
.
<EOS>
The
hope
of
meeting
again
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
could
only
put
into
Catherine
's
head
what
might
happen
within
that
time
to
make
a
meeting
dreadful
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
forget
Henry
Tilney
,
or
think
of
him
with
less
tenderness
than
she
did
at
that
moment
;
but
he
might
forget
her
;
and
in
that
case
,
to
meet
 
!
<EOS>
Her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
pictured
her
acquaintance
so
renewed
;
and
her
mother
,
perceiving
her
comfortable
suggestions
to
have
had
no
good
effect
,
proposed
,
as
another
expedient
for
restoring
her
spirits
,
that
they
should
call
on
Mrs.
Allen
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
houses
were
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
;
and
,
as
they
walked
,
Mrs.
Morland
quickly
dispatched
all
that
she
felt
on
the
score
of
James
's
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
sorry
for
him
,
"
said
she
;
"
but
otherwise
there
is
no
harm
done
in
the
match
going
off
;
for
it
could
not
be
a
desirable
thing
to
have
him
engaged
to
a
girl
whom
we
had
not
the
smallest
acquaintance
with
,
and
who
was
so
entirely
without
fortune
;
and
now
,
after
such
behaviour
,
we
can
not
think
at
all
well
of
her
.
<EOS>
Just
at
present
it
comes
hard
to
poor
James
;
but
that
will
not
last
forever
;
and
I
dare
say
he
will
be
a
discreeter
man
all
his
life
,
for
the
foolishness
of
his
first
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
just
such
a
summary
view
of
the
affair
as
Catherine
could
listen
to
;
another
sentence
might
have
endangered
her
complaisance
,
and
made
her
reply
less
rational
;
for
soon
were
all
her
thinking
powers
swallowed
up
in
the
reflection
of
her
own
change
of
feelings
and
spirits
since
last
she
had
trodden
that
well
-
known
road
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
three
months
ago
since
,
wild
with
joyful
expectation
<EOS>
,
she
had
there
run
backwards
and
forwards
some
ten
times
a
day
,
with
an
heart
light
,
gay
,
and
independent
;
looking
forward
to
pleasures
untasted
and
unalloyed
,
and
free
from
the
apprehension
of
evil
as
from
the
knowledge
of
it
.
<EOS>
Three
months
ago
had
seen
her
all
this
;
and
now
,
how
altered
a
being
<EOS>
did
she
return
!
  
<EOS>
She
was
received
by
the
Allens
with
all
the
kindness
which
her
unlooked
-
for
appearance
,
acting
on
a
steady
affection
,
would
naturally
call
forth
;
and
great
was
their
surprise
,
and
warm
their
displeasure
,
on
hearing
how
she
had
been
treated
 
though
Mrs.
Morland
's
account
of
it
was
no
inflated
representation
,
no
studied
appeal
to
their
passions
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Catherine
took
us
quite
by
surprise
yesterday
evening
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
travelled
all
the
way
post
by
herself
,
and
knew
nothing
of
coming
till
Saturday
night
;
for
General
Tilney
,
from
some
odd
fancy
or
other
,
all
of
a
sudden
grew
tired
of
having
her
there
,
and
almost
turned
her
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Very
unfriendly
,
certainly
;
and
he
must
be
a
very
odd
man
;
but
we
are
so
glad
to
have
her
amongst
us
again
!
<EOS>
And
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
find
that
she
is
not
a
poor
helpless
creature
,
but
can
shift
very
well
for
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Allen
expressed
himself
on
the
occasion
with
the
reasonable
resentment
of
a
sensible
friend
;
and
Mrs.
Allen
thought
his
expressions
quite
good
enough
to
be
immediately
made
use
of
again
by
herself
.
<EOS>
His
wonder
,
his
conjectures
,
and
his
explanations
became
in
succession
hers
,
with
the
addition
of
this
single
remark
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
have
not
patience
with
the
general
"
 
to
fill
up
every
accidental
pause
.
<EOS>
And
,
"
I
really
have
not
patience
with
the
general
,
"
was
uttered
twice
after
Mr.
Allen
left
the
room
,
without
any
relaxation
of
anger
,
or
any
material
digression
of
thought
.
<EOS>
A
more
considerable
degree
of
wandering
attended
the
third
repetition
;
and
,
after
completing
the
fourth
,
she
immediately
added
,
"
Only
think
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
of
my
having
got
that
frightful
great
rent
in
my
best
Mechlin
<EOS>
so
charmingly
mended
,
before
I
left
Bath
,
that
one
can
hardly
see
where
it
was
.
<EOS>
I
must
show
it
you
some
day
or
other
.
<EOS>
Bath
is
a
nice
place
,
Catherine
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
did
not
above
half
like
coming
away
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Thorpe
's
being
there
was
such
a
comfort
to
us
,
was
not
it
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
you
and
I
were
quite
forlorn
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
that
did
not
last
long
,
"
said
Catherine
,
her
eyes
brightening
at
the
recollection
of
what
had
first
given
spirit
to
her
existence
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
:
we
soon
met
with
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
and
then
we
wanted
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
do
not
you
think
these
silk
gloves
wear
very
well
?
<EOS>
I
put
them
on
new
the
first
time
of
our
going
to
the
Lower
Rooms
,
you
know
,
and
I
have
worn
them
a
great
deal
since
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
that
evening
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
agreeable
,
was
not
it
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Tilney
drank
tea
with
us
,
and
I
always
thought
him
a
great
addition
,
he
is
so
very
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
notion
you
danced
with
him
,
but
am
not
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
had
my
favourite
gown
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
could
not
answer
;
and
,
after
a
short
trial
of
other
subjects
,
Mrs.
Allen
again
returned
to
 
"
I
really
have
not
patience
with
the
general
!
<EOS>
Such
an
agreeable
,
worthy
man
as
he
seemed
to
be
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
,
Mrs.
Morland
,
you
ever
saw
a
better
-
bred
man
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
His
lodgings
were
taken
the
very
day
after
he
left
them
,
Catherine
.
<EOS>
But
no
wonder
;
Milsom
Street
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
walked
home
again
,
Mrs.
Morland
endeavoured
to
impress
on
her
daughter
's
mind
the
happiness
of
having
such
steady
well
-
wishers
as
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
and
the
very
little
consideration
which
the
neglect
or
unkindness
of
slight
acquaintance
like
the
Tilneys
ought
to
have
with
her
,
while
she
could
preserve
the
good
opinion
and
affection
of
her
earliest
friends
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
deal
of
good
sense
in
all
this
;
but
there
are
some
situations
of
the
human
mind
in
which
good
sense
has
very
little
power
;
and
Catherine
's
feelings
contradicted
almost
every
position
her
mother
advanced
.
<EOS>
It
was
upon
the
behaviour
of
these
very
slight
acquaintance
that
all
her
present
happiness
depended
;
and
while
Mrs.
Morland
was
successfully
confirming
her
own
opinions
by
the
justness
of
her
own
representations
,
Catherine
was
silently
reflecting
that
now
Henry
must
have
arrived
at
Northanger
;
now
he
must
have
heard
of
her
departure
;
and
now
,
perhaps
,
they
were
all
setting
off
for
Hereford
.
    
<EOS>
Catherine
's
disposition
was
not
naturally
sedentary
,
nor
had
her
habits
been
ever
very
industrious
;
but
whatever
might
hitherto
have
been
her
defects
of
that
sort
,
<EOS>
her
mother
could
not
but
perceive
them
now
to
be
greatly
increased
.
<EOS>
She
could
neither
sit
still
nor
employ
herself
for
ten
minutes
together
,
walking
round
the
garden
and
orchard
again
and
again
,
as
if
nothing
but
motion
was
voluntary
;
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
even
walk
about
the
house
rather
than
remain
fixed
for
any
time
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
Her
loss
of
spirits
was
a
yet
greater
alteration
.
<EOS>
In
her
rambling
and
her
idleness
she
might
only
be
a
caricature
of
herself
;
but
in
her
silence
and
sadness
she
was
the
very
reverse
of
all
that
she
had
been
before
.
  
<EOS>
For
two
days
Mrs.
Morland
allowed
it
to
pass
even
without
a
hint
;
but
when
a
third
night
's
rest
had
neither
restored
her
cheerfulness
,
improved
her
in
useful
activity
,
nor
given
her
a
greater
inclination
for
needlework
,
she
could
no
longer
refrain
from
the
gentle
reproof
of
,
"
My
dear
Catherine
,
I
am
afraid
you
are
growing
quite
a
fine
lady
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
poor
Richard
's
cravats
would
be
done
,
if
he
had
no
friend
but
you
.
<EOS>
Your
head
runs
too
much
upon
Bath
;
but
there
is
a
time
for
everything
 
a
time
for
balls
and
plays
,
and
a
time
for
work
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
a
long
run
of
amusement
,
and
now
you
must
try
to
be
useful
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
took
up
her
work
directly
,
saying
,
in
a
dejected
voice
,
that
"
her
head
did
not
run
upon
Bath
 
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
fretting
about
General
Tilney
,
and
that
is
very
simple
of
you
;
for
ten
to
one
whether
you
ever
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
You
should
never
fret
about
trifles
.
<EOS>
"
After
a
short
silence
 
"
I
hope
,
my
Catherine
,
you
are
not
getting
out
of
humour
with
home
because
it
is
not
so
grand
as
Northanger
.
<EOS>
That
would
be
turning
your
visit
into
an
evil
indeed
.
<EOS>
Wherever
you
are
you
should
always
be
contented
,
but
especially
at
home
,
because
there
you
must
spend
the
most
of
your
time
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
quite
like
,
at
breakfast
,
to
hear
you
talk
so
much
about
the
French
bread
at
Northanger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
do
not
care
about
the
bread
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
the
same
to
me
what
I
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
very
clever
essay
in
one
of
the
books
upstairs
upon
much
such
a
subject
,
about
young
girls
that
have
been
spoilt
for
home
by
great
acquaintance
 
<EOS>
The
Mirror
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
will
look
it
out
for
you
some
day
or
other
,
because
I
am
sure
it
will
do
you
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
said
no
more
,
and
,
with
an
endeavour
to
do
right
,
applied
to
her
work
;
but
,
after
a
few
minutes
,
sunk
again
,
without
knowing
it
herself
,
into
languor
and
listlessness
,
moving
herself
in
her
chair
,
from
the
irritation
of
weariness
,
much
oftener
than
she
moved
her
needle
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Morland
watched
the
progress
of
this
relapse
;
and
seeing
,
in
her
daughter
's
absent
and
dissatisfied
look
,
the
full
proof
of
that
repining
spirit
to
which
she
had
now
begun
to
attribute
her
want
of
cheerfulness
,
hastily
left
the
room
to
fetch
the
book
in
question
,
anxious
to
lose
no
time
in
attacking
so
dreadful
a
malady
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
she
could
find
what
she
looked
for
;
and
other
family
matters
occurring
to
detain
her
,
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
ere
<EOS>
she
returned
downstairs
with
the
volume
from
which
so
much
was
hoped
.
<EOS>
Her
avocations
above
having
shut
out
all
noise
but
<EOS>
what
she
created
herself
,
she
knew
not
that
a
visitor
had
arrived
within
the
last
few
minutes
,
till
,
on
entering
the
room
,
the
first
object
she
beheld
was
a
young
man
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
.
<EOS>
With
a
look
of
much
respect
,
he
immediately
rose
,
and
being
introduced
to
her
by
her
conscious
daughter
as
"
Mr.
Henry
Tilney
,
"
with
the
embarrassment
of
real
sensibility
began
to
apologize
for
his
appearance
there
,
acknowledging
that
after
what
had
passed
he
had
little
right
to
expect
a
welcome
at
Fullerton
,
and
stating
his
impatience
to
be
assured
of
Miss
Morland
's
having
reached
her
home
in
safety
,
as
the
cause
of
his
intrusion
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
address
himself
to
an
uncandid
judge
or
a
resentful
heart
.
<EOS>
Far
from
comprehending
him
or
his
sister
in
their
father
's
misconduct
,
Mrs.
Morland
had
been
always
kindly
disposed
towards
each
,
and
instantly
,
pleased
by
his
appearance
,
received
him
with
the
simple
professions
of
unaffected
benevolence
;
thanking
him
for
such
an
attention
to
her
daughter
,
assuring
him
that
the
friends
of
her
children
were
always
welcome
there
,
and
entreating
him
to
say
not
another
word
of
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
ill
-
inclined
to
obey
this
request
,
for
,
though
his
heart
was
greatly
relieved
by
such
unlooked
-
for
mildness
,
it
was
not
just
at
that
moment
in
his
power
to
say
anything
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Returning
in
silence
to
his
seat
,
therefore
,
he
remained
for
some
minutes
most
civilly
answering
all
Mrs.
Morland
's
common
remarks
about
the
weather
and
roads
.
<EOS>
Catherine
meanwhile
 
the
anxious
,
agitated
,
happy
,
feverish
Catherine
 
said
not
a
word
;
but
her
glowing
cheek
and
brightened
eye
made
her
mother
trust
that
this
good
-
natured
visit
would
at
least
set
her
heart
at
ease
for
a
time
,
and
gladly
therefore
did
she
lay
aside
the
first
volume
of
The
Mirror
for
a
future
hour
.
  
<EOS>
Desirous
of
Mr.
Morland
's
assistance
,
as
well
in
giving
encouragement
,
as
in
finding
conversation
for
her
guest
,
whose
embarrassment
on
his
father
's
account
she
earnestly
pitied
,
Mrs.
Morland
had
very
early
dispatched
one
of
the
children
to
summon
him
;
but
Mr.
Morland
was
from
home
 
and
being
thus
without
any
support
,
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
had
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
After
a
couple
of
minutes
'
unbroken
silence
,
Henry
,
turning
to
Catherine
for
the
first
time
since
her
mother
's
entrance
,
asked
her
,
with
sudden
alacrity
,
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
were
now
at
Fullerton
?
<EOS>
And
on
developing
,
from
amidst
all
her
perplexity
of
words
in
reply
,
the
meaning
,
which
one
short
syllable
would
have
given
,
immediately
expressed
his
intention
of
paying
his
respects
to
them
,
and
,
with
a
rising
colour
,
asked
her
if
she
would
have
the
goodness
to
show
him
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
see
the
house
from
this
window
,
sir
,
"
was
information
on
Sarah
's
side
,
which
produced
only
a
bow
of
acknowledgment
from
the
gentleman
,
and
a
silencing
nod
from
her
mother
;
for
Mrs.
Morland
,
thinking
it
probable
,
as
a
secondary
consideration
in
his
wish
of
waiting
on
their
worthy
neighbours
,
that
he
might
have
some
explanation
to
give
of
his
father
's
behaviour
,
which
it
must
be
more
pleasant
for
him
to
communicate
only
to
Catherine
,
would
not
on
any
account
prevent
her
accompanying
him
.
<EOS>
They
began
their
walk
,
and
Mrs.
Morland
was
not
entirely
mistaken
in
his
object
in
wishing
it
.
<EOS>
Some
explanation
on
his
father
's
account
he
had
to
give
;
but
his
first
purpose
was
to
explain
himself
,
and
before
they
reached
Mr.
Allen
's
grounds
he
had
done
it
so
well
that
Catherine
did
not
think
it
could
ever
be
repeated
too
often
.
<EOS>
She
was
assured
of
his
affection
;
and
that
heart
in
return
was
solicited
,
which
,
perhaps
,
they
pretty
equally
knew
was
already
entirely
his
own
;
for
,
though
Henry
was
now
sincerely
attached
to
her
,
though
he
felt
and
delighted
in
all
the
excellencies
of
her
character
and
truly
loved
her
society
,
I
must
confess
that
his
affection
originated
in
nothing
better
than
gratitude
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
that
a
persuasion
of
her
partiality
for
him
had
been
the
only
cause
of
giving
her
a
serious
thought
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
new
circumstance
in
romance
,
I
acknowledge
,
and
dreadfully
derogatory
of
an
heroine
's
dignity
;
but
if
it
be
as
new
in
common
life
,
the
credit
of
a
wild
imagination
will
at
least
be
all
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
A
very
short
visit
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
in
which
Henry
talked
at
random
,
without
sense
or
connection
,
and
Catherine
,
rapt
in
the
contemplation
of
her
own
unutterable
happiness
,
scarcely
opened
her
lips
,
dismissed
them
to
the
ecstasies
of
another
tete
-
a
-
tete
;
and
before
it
was
suffered
to
close
,
she
was
enabled
to
judge
how
far
he
was
sanctioned
by
parental
authority
in
his
present
application
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
from
Woodston
,
two
days
before
,
he
had
been
met
near
the
abbey
by
his
impatient
father
,
hastily
informed
in
angry
terms
of
Miss
Morland
's
departure
,
and
ordered
to
think
of
her
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
permission
upon
which
he
had
now
offered
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
affrighted
Catherine
,
amidst
all
the
terrors
of
expectation
,
as
she
listened
to
this
account
,
could
not
but
rejoice
in
the
kind
caution
with
which
Henry
had
saved
her
from
the
necessity
of
a
conscientious
rejection
,
by
engaging
her
faith
before
he
mentioned
the
subject
;
and
as
he
proceeded
to
give
the
particulars
,
and
explain
the
motives
of
his
father
's
conduct
,
her
feelings
soon
hardened
into
even
a
triumphant
delight
.
<EOS>
The
general
had
had
nothing
to
accuse
her
of
,
nothing
to
lay
to
her
charge
,
but
her
being
the
involuntary
,
unconscious
object
of
a
deception
which
his
pride
could
not
pardon
,
and
which
a
better
pride
would
have
been
ashamed
to
own
.
<EOS>
She
was
guilty
only
of
being
less
rich
than
he
had
supposed
her
to
be
.
<EOS>
Under
a
mistaken
persuasion
of
her
possessions
and
claims
,
he
had
courted
her
acquaintance
in
Bath
,
solicited
her
company
at
Northanger
,
and
designed
her
for
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
On
discovering
his
error
,
to
turn
her
from
the
house
<EOS>
seemed
the
best
,
though
to
his
feelings
an
inadequate
proof
of
his
resentment
towards
herself
,
and
his
contempt
of
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
John
Thorpe
had
first
misled
him
.
<EOS>
The
general
,
perceiving
his
son
one
night
at
the
theatre
to
be
paying
considerable
attention
to
Miss
Morland
,
had
accidentally
inquired
of
Thorpe
if
he
knew
more
of
her
than
her
name
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
,
most
happy
to
be
on
speaking
terms
with
a
man
of
General
Tilney
's
importance
,
had
been
joyfully
and
proudly
communicative
;
and
being
at
that
time
not
only
in
daily
expectation
of
Morland
's
engaging
Isabella
,
but
likewise
pretty
well
resolved
upon
marrying
Catherine
himself
,
his
vanity
induced
him
to
represent
the
family
as
yet
more
wealthy
than
his
vanity
and
avarice
had
made
him
believe
them
.
<EOS>
With
whomsoever
he
was
,
or
was
likely
to
be
connected
,
his
own
consequence
always
required
that
theirs
should
be
great
,
and
as
his
intimacy
with
any
acquaintance
grew
,
so
regularly
grew
their
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
expectations
of
his
friend
Morland
,
therefore
,
from
the
first
overrated
,
had
ever
since
his
introduction
to
Isabella
been
gradually
increasing
;
and
by
merely
adding
twice
as
much
for
the
grandeur
of
the
moment
,
by
doubling
what
he
chose
to
think
the
amount
of
Mr.
Morland
's
preferment
,
trebling
his
private
fortune
,
bestowing
a
rich
aunt
,
and
sinking
half
the
children
,
he
was
able
to
represent
the
whole
family
to
the
general
in
a
most
respectable
light
.
<EOS>
For
Catherine
,
however
,
the
peculiar
object
of
the
general
's
curiosity
,
and
his
own
speculations
,
he
had
yet
something
more
in
reserve
,
and
the
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
pounds
which
her
father
could
give
her
would
be
a
pretty
addition
to
Mr.
Allen
's
estate
.
<EOS>
Her
intimacy
there
had
made
him
seriously
determine
on
her
being
handsomely
legacied
hereafter
;
and
to
speak
of
her
therefore
as
the
almost
acknowledged
future
heiress
of
Fullerton
naturally
followed
.
<EOS>
Upon
such
intelligence
the
general
had
proceeded
;
for
never
had
it
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
its
authority
.
<EOS>
Thorpe
's
interest
in
the
family
,
by
his
sister
's
approaching
connection
with
one
of
its
members
,
and
his
own
views
on
another
(
circumstances
of
which
he
boasted
with
almost
equal
openness
)
,
seemed
sufficient
vouchers
for
his
truth
;
and
to
these
were
added
the
absolute
facts
of
the
Allens
being
wealthy
and
childless
,
of
Miss
Morland
's
being
under
their
care
,
and
 
as
soon
as
his
acquaintance
allowed
him
to
judge
 
of
their
treating
her
with
parental
kindness
.
<EOS>
His
resolution
was
soon
formed
.
<EOS>
Already
had
he
discerned
a
liking
towards
Miss
Morland
in
the
countenance
of
his
son
;
and
thankful
for
Mr.
Thorpe
's
communication
,
he
almost
instantly
determined
to
spare
no
pains
in
weakening
his
boasted
interest
and
ruining
his
dearest
hopes
.
<EOS>
Catherine
herself
could
not
be
more
ignorant
at
the
time
of
all
this
,
than
his
own
children
.
<EOS>
Henry
and
Eleanor
,
perceiving
nothing
in
her
situation
likely
to
engage
their
father
's
particular
respect
,
had
seen
with
astonishment
the
suddenness
,
continuance
,
and
extent
of
his
attention
;
and
though
latterly
,
from
some
hints
which
had
accompanied
an
almost
positive
command
to
his
son
of
doing
everything
in
his
power
to
attach
her
,
Henry
was
convinced
of
his
father
's
believing
it
to
be
an
advantageous
connection
,
it
was
not
till
the
late
explanation
at
Northanger
that
they
had
the
smallest
idea
of
the
false
calculations
which
had
hurried
him
on
.
<EOS>
That
they
were
false
,
the
general
had
learnt
from
the
very
person
who
had
suggested
them
,
from
Thorpe
himself
,
whom
he
had
chanced
to
meet
again
in
town
,
and
who
,
under
the
influence
of
exactly
opposite
feelings
,
irritated
by
Catherine
's
refusal
,
and
yet
more
by
the
failure
of
a
very
recent
endeavour
to
accomplish
a
reconciliation
between
Morland
and
Isabella
,
convinced
that
they
were
separated
forever
,
and
spurning
a
friendship
which
could
be
no
longer
serviceable
,
hastened
to
contradict
all
that
he
had
said
before
to
the
advantage
of
the
Morlands
 
confessed
himself
to
have
been
totally
mistaken
in
his
opinion
of
their
circumstances
and
character
,
misled
by
the
rhodomontade
of
his
friend
to
believe
his
father
a
man
of
substance
and
credit
,
whereas
the
transactions
of
the
two
or
three
last
weeks
proved
him
to
be
neither
;
for
after
coming
eagerly
forward
on
the
first
overture
of
a
marriage
between
the
families
,
with
the
most
liberal
proposals
,
he
had
,
on
being
brought
to
the
point
by
the
shrewdness
of
the
relator
,
been
constrained
to
acknowledge
himself
incapable
of
giving
the
young
people
even
a
decent
support
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
in
fact
,
a
necessitous
family
;
numerous
,
too
,
almost
beyond
example
;
by
no
means
respected
in
their
own
neighbourhood
,
as
he
had
lately
had
particular
opportunities
of
discovering
;
aiming
at
a
style
of
life
which
their
fortune
could
not
warrant
;
seeking
to
better
themselves
by
wealthy
connections
;
a
forward
,
bragging
,
scheming
race
.
  
<EOS>
The
terrified
general
pronounced
the
name
of
Allen
with
an
inquiring
look
;
and
here
too
Thorpe
had
learnt
his
error
.
<EOS>
The
Allens
,
he
believed
,
had
lived
near
them
too
long
,
and
he
knew
the
young
man
on
whom
the
Fullerton
estate
must
devolve
.
<EOS>
The
general
needed
no
more
.
<EOS>
Enraged
with
almost
everybody
in
the
world
but
himself
,
he
set
out
the
next
day
for
the
abbey
,
where
his
performances
have
been
seen
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
my
reader
's
sagacity
to
determine
how
much
of
all
this
it
was
possible
for
Henry
to
communicate
at
this
time
to
Catherine
,
how
much
of
it
he
could
have
learnt
from
his
father
,
in
what
points
his
own
conjectures
might
assist
him
,
and
what
portion
must
yet
remain
to
be
told
in
a
letter
from
James
.
<EOS>
I
have
united
for
their
ease
what
they
must
divide
for
mine
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
at
any
rate
,
heard
enough
to
feel
that
in
suspecting
General
Tilney
of
either
murdering
or
shutting
up
his
wife
,
she
had
scarcely
sinned
against
his
character
,
or
magnified
his
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
,
in
having
such
things
to
relate
of
his
father
,
was
almost
as
pitiable
as
in
their
first
avowal
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
blushed
for
the
narrow
-
minded
counsel
which
he
was
obliged
to
expose
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
between
them
at
Northanger
had
been
of
the
most
unfriendly
kind
.
<EOS>
Henry
's
indignation
on
hearing
how
Catherine
had
been
treated
,
on
comprehending
his
father
's
views
,
and
being
ordered
to
acquiesce
in
them
,
had
been
open
and
bold
.
<EOS>
The
general
,
accustomed
on
every
ordinary
occasion
to
give
the
law
in
his
family
,
prepared
for
no
reluctance
but
of
feeling
,
no
opposing
desire
that
should
dare
to
clothe
itself
in
words
,
could
ill
brook
the
opposition
of
his
son
,
steady
as
the
sanction
of
reason
and
the
dictate
of
conscience
could
make
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
such
a
cause
,
his
anger
,
though
it
must
shock
,
could
not
intimidate
Henry
,
who
was
sustained
in
his
purpose
by
a
conviction
of
its
justice
.
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
bound
as
much
in
honour
as
in
affection
to
Miss
Morland
,
and
believing
that
heart
to
be
his
own
which
he
had
been
directed
to
gain
,
no
unworthy
retraction
of
a
tacit
consent
,
no
reversing
decree
of
unjustifiable
anger
,
could
shake
his
fidelity
,
or
influence
the
resolutions
it
prompted
.
  
<EOS>
He
steadily
refused
to
accompany
his
father
into
Herefordshire
,
an
engagement
formed
almost
at
the
moment
to
promote
the
dismissal
of
Catherine
,
and
as
steadily
declared
his
intention
of
offering
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
general
was
furious
in
his
anger
,
and
they
parted
in
dreadful
disagreement
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
in
an
agitation
of
mind
which
many
solitary
hours
were
required
to
compose
,
had
returned
almost
instantly
to
Woodston
,
and
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
,
had
begun
his
journey
to
Fullerton
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
's
surprise
on
being
applied
to
by
Mr.
Tilney
for
their
consent
to
his
marrying
their
daughter
was
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
considerable
,
it
having
never
entered
their
heads
to
suspect
an
attachment
on
either
side
;
but
as
nothing
,
after
all
,
could
be
more
natural
than
Catherine
's
being
beloved
,
they
soon
learnt
to
consider
it
with
only
the
happy
agitation
of
gratified
pride
,
and
,
as
far
as
they
alone
were
concerned
,
had
not
a
single
objection
to
start
.
<EOS>
His
pleasing
manners
and
good
sense
were
self
-
evident
recommendations
;
and
having
never
heard
evil
of
him
,
it
was
not
their
way
to
suppose
any
evil
could
be
told
.
<EOS>
Goodwill
supplying
the
place
of
experience
,
his
character
needed
no
attestation
.
<EOS>
"
Catherine
would
make
a
sad
,
heedless
young
housekeeper
to
be
sure
,
"
was
her
mother
's
foreboding
remark
;
but
quick
was
the
consolation
of
there
being
nothing
like
practice
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
obstacle
,
in
short
,
to
be
mentioned
;
but
till
that
one
was
removed
,
it
must
be
impossible
for
them
to
sanction
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
Their
tempers
were
mild
,
but
their
principles
were
steady
,
and
while
his
parent
so
expressly
forbade
the
connection
,
they
could
not
allow
themselves
to
encourage
it
.
<EOS>
That
the
general
should
come
forward
to
solicit
the
alliance
,
or
that
he
should
even
very
heartily
approve
it
,
they
were
not
refined
enough
to
make
any
parading
stipulation
;
but
the
decent
appearance
of
consent
must
be
yielded
,
and
that
once
obtained
 
and
their
own
hearts
made
them
trust
that
it
could
not
be
very
long
denied
 
their
willing
approbation
was
instantly
to
follow
.
<EOS>
His
consent
was
all
that
they
wished
for
.
<EOS>
They
were
no
more
inclined
than
entitled
to
demand
his
money
.
<EOS>
Of
a
very
considerable
fortune
,
his
son
was
,
by
marriage
settlements
,
eventually
secure
;
his
present
income
was
an
income
of
independence
and
comfort
,
and
under
every
pecuniary
view
,
it
was
a
match
beyond
the
claims
of
their
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
people
could
not
be
surprised
at
a
decision
like
this
.
<EOS>
They
felt
and
they
deplored
 
<EOS>
but
they
could
not
resent
it
;
and
they
parted
,
endeavouring
to
hope
that
such
a
change
in
the
general
,
as
each
believed
almost
impossible
,
might
speedily
take
place
,
to
unite
them
again
in
the
fullness
of
privileged
affection
.
<EOS>
Henry
returned
to
what
was
now
his
only
home
,
to
watch
over
his
young
plantations
,
and
extend
his
improvements
for
her
sake
,
to
whose
share
in
them
he
looked
anxiously
forward
;
and
Catherine
remained
at
Fullerton
to
cry
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
torments
of
absence
were
softened
by
a
clandestine
correspondence
,
let
us
not
inquire
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
never
did
 
<EOS>
they
had
been
too
kind
to
exact
any
promise
;
and
whenever
Catherine
received
a
letter
,
as
,
at
that
time
,
happened
pretty
often
,
they
always
looked
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
The
anxiety
,
which
in
this
state
of
their
attachment
must
be
the
portion
of
Henry
and
Catherine
,
and
of
all
who
loved
either
,
as
to
its
final
event
,
can
hardly
extend
,
I
fear
,
to
the
bosom
of
my
readers
,
who
will
see
in
the
tell
-
tale
compression
of
the
pages
before
them
,
that
we
are
all
hastening
together
to
perfect
felicity
.
<EOS>
The
means
by
which
their
early
marriage
was
effected
can
be
the
only
doubt
:
<EOS>
what
probable
circumstance
could
work
upon
a
temper
like
the
general
's
?
<EOS>
The
circumstance
which
chiefly
availed
was
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
with
a
man
of
fortune
and
consequence
,
which
took
place
in
the
course
of
the
summer
 
an
accession
of
dignity
that
threw
him
into
a
fit
of
good
humour
,
from
which
he
did
not
recover
till
after
Eleanor
had
obtained
his
forgiveness
of
Henry
,
and
his
permission
for
him
"
to
be
a
fool
if
he
liked
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
marriage
of
Eleanor
Tilney
,
her
removal
from
all
the
evils
of
such
a
home
as
Northanger
had
been
made
by
Henry
's
banishment
,
to
the
home
of
her
choice
and
the
man
of
her
choice
,
is
an
event
which
I
expect
to
give
general
satisfaction
among
all
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
My
own
joy
on
the
occasion
is
very
sincere
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
one
more
entitled
,
by
unpretending
merit
,
or
better
prepared
by
habitual
suffering
,
to
receive
and
enjoy
felicity
.
<EOS>
Her
partiality
for
this
gentleman
was
not
of
recent
origin
;
and
he
had
been
long
withheld
only
by
inferiority
of
situation
from
addressing
her
.
<EOS>
His
unexpected
accession
to
title
and
fortune
had
removed
all
his
difficulties
;
and
never
had
the
general
loved
his
daughter
so
well
in
all
her
hours
of
companionship
,
utility
,
and
patient
endurance
as
when
he
first
hailed
her
"
Your
Ladyship
!
"
<EOS>
Her
husband
was
really
deserving
of
her
;
independent
of
his
peerage
,
his
wealth
,
and
his
attachment
,
being
to
a
precision
the
most
charming
young
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Any
further
definition
of
his
merits
must
be
unnecessary
;
the
most
charming
young
man
in
the
world
is
instantly
before
the
imagination
of
us
all
.
<EOS>
Concerning
the
one
in
question
,
therefore
,
I
have
only
to
add
 
aware
that
the
rules
of
composition
forbid
the
introduction
of
a
character
not
connected
with
my
fable
 
that
this
was
the
very
gentleman
whose
negligent
servant
left
behind
him
that
collection
of
washing
-
bills
,
resulting
from
a
long
visit
at
Northanger
,
by
which
my
heroine
was
involved
in
one
of
her
most
alarming
adventures
.
  
<EOS>
The
influence
of
the
viscount
and
viscountess
in
their
brother
's
behalf
was
assisted
by
that
right
understanding
of
Mr.
Morland
's
circumstances
which
,
as
soon
as
the
general
would
allow
himself
to
be
informed
,
they
were
qualified
to
give
.
<EOS>
It
taught
him
that
he
had
been
scarcely
more
misled
by
Thorpe
's
first
boast
of
the
family
wealth
than
by
his
subsequent
malicious
overthrow
of
it
;
that
in
no
sense
of
the
word
were
they
necessitous
or
poor
,
and
that
Catherine
would
have
three
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
This
was
so
material
an
amendment
of
his
late
expectations
that
it
greatly
contributed
to
smooth
the
descent
of
his
pride
;
and
by
no
means
without
its
effect
was
the
private
intelligence
,
which
he
was
at
some
pains
to
procure
,
that
the
Fullerton
estate
,
being
entirely
at
the
disposal
of
its
present
proprietor
,
was
consequently
open
to
every
greedy
speculation
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
strength
of
this
,
the
general
,
soon
after
Eleanor
's
marriage
,
permitted
his
son
to
return
to
Northanger
,
and
thence
made
him
the
bearer
of
his
consent
,
very
courteously
worded
in
a
page
full
of
empty
professions
to
Mr.
Morland
.
<EOS>
The
event
which
it
authorized
soon
followed
:
Henry
and
Catherine
were
married
,
the
bells
rang
,
and
everybody
smiled
;
and
,
as
this
took
place
within
a
twelvemonth
from
the
first
day
of
their
meeting
,
it
will
not
appear
,
after
all
the
dreadful
delays
occasioned
by
the
general
's
cruelty
,
that
they
were
essentially
hurt
by
it
.
<EOS>
To
begin
perfect
happiness
at
the
respective
ages
of
twenty
-
six
and
eighteen
is
to
do
pretty
well
;
and
professing
myself
moreover
convinced
that
the
general
's
unjust
interference
,
so
far
from
being
really
injurious
to
their
felicity
,
was
perhaps
rather
conducive
to
it
,
by
improving
their
knowledge
of
each
other
,
and
adding
strength
to
their
attachment
,
I
leave
it
to
be
settled
,
by
whomsoever
it
may
concern
,
whether
the
tendency
of
this
work
be
altogether
to
recommend
parental
tyranny
,
or
reward
filial
disobedience
.
