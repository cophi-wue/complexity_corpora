Introductory
,
concerning
the
pedigree
of
the
Chuzzlewit
family
 
<EOS>
As
no
lady
or
gentleman
,
with
any
claims
to
polite
breeding
,
can
possibly
sympathize
with
the
Chuzzlewit
Family
without
being
first
assured
of
the
extreme
antiquity
of
the
race
,
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
know
that
it
undoubtedly
descended
in
a
direct
line
from
Adam
and
Eve
;
and
was
,
in
the
very
earliest
times
,
closely
connected
with
the
agricultural
interest
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
should
ever
be
urged
by
grudging
and
malicious
persons
,
that
a
Chuzzlewit
,
in
any
period
of
the
family
history
,
displayed
an
overweening
amount
of
family
pride
,
surely
the
weakness
will
be
considered
not
only
pardonable
but
laudable
,
when
the
immense
superiority
of
the
house
to
the
rest
of
mankind
,
in
respect
of
this
its
ancient
origin
,
is
taken
into
account
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
remarkable
that
as
there
was
,
in
the
oldest
family
of
which
we
have
any
record
,
a
murderer
and
a
vagabond
,
so
we
never
fail
to
meet
,
in
the
records
of
all
old
families
,
with
innumerable
repetitions
of
the
same
phase
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
may
be
laid
down
as
a
general
principle
,
that
the
more
extended
the
ancestry
,
the
greater
the
amount
of
violence
and
vagabondism
;
for
in
ancient
days
those
two
amusements
,
combining
a
wholesome
excitement
with
a
promising
means
of
repairing
shattered
fortunes
,
were
at
once
the
ennobling
pursuit
and
the
healthful
recreation
of
the
Quality
of
this
land
.
   
<EOS>
Consequently
,
it
is
a
source
of
inexpressible
comfort
and
happiness
to
find
,
that
in
various
periods
of
our
history
,
the
Chuzzlewits
were
actively
connected
with
divers
slaughterous
conspiracies
and
bloody
frays
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
further
recorded
of
them
,
that
being
clad
from
head
to
heel
in
steel
of
proof
,
they
did
on
many
occasions
lead
their
leather
-
jerkined
soldiers
to
the
death
with
invincible
courage
,
and
afterwards
return
home
gracefully
to
their
relations
and
friends
.
   
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
at
least
one
Chuzzlewit
came
over
with
William
the
Conqueror
.
 
<EOS>
It
does
not
appear
that
this
illustrious
ancestor
"
came
over
"
that
monarch
,
to
employ
the
vulgar
phrase
,
at
any
subsequent
period
;
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
the
Family
do
not
seem
to
have
been
ever
greatly
distinguished
by
the
possession
of
landed
estate
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
well
known
that
for
the
bestowal
of
that
kind
of
property
upon
his
favourites
,
the
liberality
and
gratitude
of
the
Norman
were
as
remarkable
as
those
virtues
are
usually
found
to
be
in
great
men
when
they
give
away
what
belongs
to
other
people
.
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
in
this
place
the
history
may
pause
to
congratulate
itself
upon
the
enormous
amount
of
bravery
,
wisdom
,
eloquence
,
virtue
,
gentle
birth
,
and
true
nobility
,
that
appears
to
have
come
into
England
with
the
Norman
Invasion
:
an
amount
which
the
genealogy
of
every
ancient
family
lends
its
aid
to
swell
,
and
which
would
beyond
all
question
have
been
found
to
be
just
as
great
,
and
to
the
full
as
prolific
in
giving
birth
to
long
lines
of
chivalrous
descendants
,
boastful
of
their
origin
,
even
though
William
the
Conqueror
had
been
William
the
Conquered
;
a
change
of
circumstances
which
,
it
is
quite
certain
,
would
have
made
no
manner
of
difference
in
this
respect
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
unquestionably
a
Chuzzlewit
in
the
Gunpowder
Plot
,
if
indeed
the
arch
-
traitor
,
Fawkes
himself
,
were
not
a
scion
of
this
remarkable
stock
;
as
he
might
easily
have
been
,
supposing
another
Chuzzlewit
to
have
emigrated
to
Spain
in
the
previous
generation
,
and
there
intermarried
with
a
Spanish
lady
,
by
whom
he
had
issue
,
one
olive
-
complexioned
son
.
 
<EOS>
This
probable
conjecture
is
strengthened
,
if
not
absolutely
confirmed
,
by
a
fact
which
can
not
fail
to
be
interesting
to
those
who
are
curious
in
tracing
the
progress
of
hereditary
tastes
through
the
lives
of
their
unconscious
inheritors
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
notable
circumstance
<EOS>
that
in
these
later
times
,
many
Chuzzlewits
,
being
unsuccessful
in
other
pursuits
,
have
,
without
the
smallest
rational
hope
of
enriching
themselves
,
or
any
conceivable
reason
,
set
up
as
coal
-
merchants
;
and
have
,
month
after
month
,
continued
gloomily
to
watch
a
small
stock
of
coals
,
without
in
any
one
instance
negotiating
with
a
purchaser
.
 
<EOS>
The
remarkable
similarity
between
this
course
of
proceeding
and
that
adopted
by
their
Great
Ancestor
beneath
the
vaults
of
the
Parliament
House
at
Westminster
,
is
too
obvious
and
too
full
of
interest
,
to
stand
in
need
of
comment
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
also
clearly
proved
by
the
oral
traditions
of
the
Family
,
that
there
existed
,
at
some
one
period
of
its
history
which
is
not
distinctly
stated
,
a
matron
of
such
destructive
principles
,
and
so
familiarized
to
the
use
and
composition
of
inflammatory
and
combustible
engines
,
that
she
was
called
"
The
Match
Maker
;
"
by
which
nickname
and
byword
she
is
recognized
in
the
Family
legends
to
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
this
was
the
Spanish
lady
,
the
mother
of
Chuzzlewit
Fawkes
.
   
<EOS>
But
there
is
one
other
piece
of
evidence
,
bearing
immediate
reference
to
their
close
connection
with
this
memorable
event
in
English
History
,
which
must
carry
conviction
,
even
to
a
mind
(
if
such
a
mind
there
be
)
remaining
unconvinced
by
these
presumptive
proofs
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
,
within
a
few
years
,
in
the
possession
of
a
highly
respectable
and
in
every
way
credible
and
unimpeachable
member
of
the
Chuzzlewit
Family
(
for
his
bitterest
enemy
never
dared
to
hint
at
his
being
otherwise
than
a
wealthy
man
)
,
a
dark
lantern
of
undoubted
antiquity
;
rendered
still
more
interesting
by
being
,
in
shape
and
pattern
,
extremely
like
such
as
are
in
use
at
the
present
day
.
 
<EOS>
Now
this
gentleman
,
since
deceased
,
was
at
all
times
ready
to
make
oath
,
and
did
again
and
again
set
forth
upon
his
solemn
asseveration
,
that
he
had
frequently
heard
his
grandmother
say
,
when
contemplating
this
venerable
relic
,
"
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
!
 
<EOS>
This
was
carried
by
my
fourth
son
on
the
fifth
of
November
,
when
he
was
a
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
These
remarkable
words
wrought
(
as
well
they
might
)
a
strong
impression
on
his
mind
,
and
he
was
in
the
habit
of
repeating
them
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
The
just
interpretation
which
they
bear
,
and
the
conclusion
to
which
they
lead
,
are
triumphant
and
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
lady
,
naturally
strong
-
minded
,
was
nevertheless
frail
and
fading
;
she
was
notoriously
subject
to
that
confusion
of
ideas
,
or
,
to
say
the
least
,
of
speech
,
to
which
age
and
garrulity
are
liable
.
<EOS>
The
slight
,
the
very
slight
,
confusion
apparent
in
these
expressions
is
manifest
,
and
is
ludicrously
easy
of
correction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
quoth
she
,
and
it
will
be
observed
that
no
emendation
whatever
is
necessary
to
be
made
in
these
two
initiative
remarks
,
"
Aye
,
aye
!
<EOS>
This
lantern
was
carried
by
my
forefather
"
---
not
fourth
son
,
which
is
preposterous
---
"
on
the
fifth
of
November
.
 
<EOS>
And
HE
was
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Here
we
have
a
remark
at
once
consistent
,
clear
,
natural
,
and
in
strict
accordance
with
the
character
of
the
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
the
anecdote
is
so
plainly
susceptible
of
this
meaning
and
no
other
,
that
it
would
be
hardly
worth
recording
in
its
original
state
,
were
it
not
a
proof
of
what
may
be
(
and
very
often
is
)
affected
not
only
in
historical
prose
but
in
imaginative
poetry
,
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
ingenious
labour
on
the
part
of
a
commentator
.
   
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
that
there
is
no
instance
,
in
modern
times
,
of
a
Chuzzlewit
having
been
found
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
the
Great
.
<EOS>
But
here
again
the
sneering
detractors
who
weave
such
miserable
figments
from
their
malicious
brains
,
are
stricken
dumb
by
evidence
.
<EOS>
For
letters
are
yet
in
the
possession
of
various
branches
of
the
family
,
from
which
it
distinctly
appears
,
being
stated
in
so
many
words
,
that
one
Diggory
Chuzzlewit
was
in
the
habit
of
perpetually
dining
with
Duke
Humphrey
.
 
<EOS>
So
constantly
was
he
a
guest
at
that
nobleman
's
table
,
indeed
;
and
so
unceasingly
were
His
Grace
's
hospitality
and
companionship
forced
,
as
it
were
,
upon
him
;
that
we
find
him
uneasy
,
and
full
of
constraint
and
reluctance
;
writing
his
friends
to
the
effect
that
if
they
fail
to
do
so
and
so
by
bearer
,
he
will
have
no
choice
but
to
dine
again
with
Duke
Humphrey
;
and
expressing
himself
in
a
very
marked
and
extraordinary
manner
as
one
surfeited
of
High
Life
and
Gracious
Company
.
   
<EOS>
It
has
been
rumoured
,
and
it
is
needless
to
say
the
rumour
originated
in
the
same
base
quarters
,
that
a
certain
male
Chuzzlewit
,
whose
birth
must
be
admitted
to
be
involved
in
some
obscurity
,
was
of
very
mean
and
low
descent
.
 
<EOS>
How
stands
the
proof
?
<EOS>
When
the
son
of
that
individual
,
to
whom
the
secret
of
his
father
's
birth
was
supposed
to
have
been
communicated
by
his
father
in
his
lifetime
,
lay
upon
his
deathbed
,
this
question
was
put
to
him
in
a
distinct
,
solemn
,
and
formal
way
:
"
Toby
Chuzzlewit
,
who
was
your
grandfather
?
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
he
,
with
his
last
breath
,
no
less
distinctly
,
solemnly
,
and
formally
replied
:
<EOS>
and
his
words
were
taken
down
at
the
time
,
and
signed
by
six
witnesses
,
each
with
his
name
and
address
in
full
:
"
The
Lord
No
Zoo
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
said
---
it
HAS
been
said
,
for
human
wickedness
has
no
limits
---
that
there
is
no
Lord
of
that
name
,
and
that
among
the
titles
which
have
become
extinct
,
none
at
all
resembling
this
,
in
sound
even
,
is
to
be
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
is
the
irresistible
inference
?
 
<EOS>
Rejecting
a
theory
broached
by
some
well
-
meaning
but
mistaken
persons
,
that
this
Mr
Toby
Chuzzlewit
's
grandfather
,
to
judge
from
his
name
,
must
surely
have
been
a
Mandarin
(
which
is
wholly
insupportable
,
<EOS>
for
there
is
no
pretence
of
his
grandmother
ever
having
been
out
of
this
country
,
or
of
any
Mandarin
having
been
in
it
within
some
years
of
his
father
's
birth
;
except
those
in
the
tea
-
shops
,
which
can
not
for
a
moment
be
regarded
as
having
any
bearing
on
the
question
,
one
way
or
other
)
,
rejecting
this
hypothesis
,
is
it
not
manifest
that
Mr
Toby
Chuzzlewit
had
either
received
the
name
imperfectly
from
his
father
,
or
that
he
had
forgotten
it
,
or
that
he
had
mispronounced
it
?
<EOS>
and
that
even
at
the
recent
period
in
question
,
the
Chuzzlewits
were
connected
by
a
bend
sinister
,
or
kind
of
heraldic
over
-
the
-
left
,
with
some
unknown
noble
and
illustrious
House
?
   
<EOS>
From
documentary
evidence
,
yet
preserved
in
the
family
,
the
fact
is
clearly
established
that
in
the
comparatively
modern
days
of
the
Diggory
Chuzzlewit
before
mentioned
,
one
of
its
members
had
attained
to
very
great
wealth
and
influence
.
 
<EOS>
Throughout
such
fragments
of
his
correspondence
as
have
escaped
the
ravages
of
the
moths
(
who
,
in
right
of
their
extensive
absorption
of
the
contents
of
deeds
and
papers
,
may
be
called
the
general
registers
of
the
Insect
World
)
,
we
find
him
making
constant
reference
to
an
uncle
,
in
respect
of
whom
he
would
seem
to
have
entertained
great
expectations
,
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
seeking
to
propitiate
his
favour
by
presents
of
plate
,
jewels
,
books
,
watches
,
and
other
valuable
articles
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
he
writes
on
one
occasion
to
his
brother
in
reference
to
a
gravy
-
spoon
,
the
brother
's
property
,
which
he
(
Diggory
)
would
appear
to
have
borrowed
or
otherwise
possessed
himself
of
:
"
Do
not
be
angry
,
I
have
parted
with
it
---
to
my
uncle
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
another
occasion
he
expresses
himself
in
a
similar
manner
with
regard
to
a
child
's
mug
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him
to
get
repaired
.
 
<EOS>
On
another
occasion
he
says
,
"
I
have
bestowed
upon
that
irresistible
uncle
of
mine
everything
I
ever
possessed
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
paying
long
and
constant
visits
to
this
gentleman
at
his
mansion
,
if
,
indeed
,
he
did
not
wholly
reside
there
<EOS>
,
is
manifest
from
the
following
sentence
:
"
With
the
exception
of
the
suit
of
clothes
I
carry
about
with
me
,
the
whole
of
my
wearing
apparel
is
at
present
at
my
uncle
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
's
patronage
and
influence
must
have
been
very
extensive
,
for
his
nephew
writes
,
"
His
interest
is
too
high
"
---
"
It
is
too
much
"
 
---
"
It
is
tremendous
"
---
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
Still
it
does
not
appear
(
which
is
strange
)
to
have
procured
for
him
any
lucrative
post
at
court
or
elsewhere
,
or
to
have
conferred
upon
him
any
other
distinction
than
that
which
was
necessarily
included
in
the
countenance
of
so
great
a
man
,
and
the
being
invited
by
him
to
certain
entertainment
's
,
so
splendid
and
costly
in
their
nature
,
that
he
calls
them
"
Golden
Balls
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
multiply
instances
of
the
high
and
lofty
station
,
and
the
vast
importance
of
the
Chuzzlewits
,
at
different
periods
.
<EOS>
If
it
came
within
the
scope
of
reasonable
probability
that
further
proofs
were
required
,
they
might
be
heaped
upon
each
other
until
they
formed
an
Alps
of
testimony
,
beneath
which
the
boldest
scepticism
should
be
crushed
and
beaten
flat
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
goodly
tumulus
is
already
collected
,
and
decently
battened
up
above
the
Family
grave
,
the
present
chapter
is
content
to
leave
it
<EOS>
as
it
is
:
merely
adding
,
by
way
of
a
final
spadeful
,
that
many
Chuzzlewits
,
both
male
and
female
,
are
proved
to
demonstration
,
on
the
faith
of
letters
written
by
their
own
mothers
,
to
have
had
chiselled
noses
,
undeniable
chins
,
forms
that
might
have
served
the
sculptor
for
a
model
,
exquisitely
-
turned
limbs
and
polished
foreheads
of
so
transparent
a
texture
that
the
blue
veins
might
be
seen
branching
off
in
various
directions
,
like
so
many
roads
on
an
ethereal
map
.
<EOS>
This
fact
in
itself
,
though
it
had
been
a
solitary
one
,
would
have
utterly
settled
and
clenched
the
business
in
hand
;
for
it
is
well
known
,
on
the
authority
of
all
the
books
which
treat
of
such
matters
,
that
every
one
of
these
phenomena
,
but
especially
that
of
the
chiselling
,
are
invariably
peculiar
to
,
and
only
make
themselves
apparent
in
,
persons
of
the
very
best
condition
.
   
<EOS>
This
history
having
,
to
its
own
perfect
satisfaction
,
(
<EOS>
and
,
consequently
,
to
the
full
contentment
of
all
its
readers
,
)
proved
the
Chuzzlewits
to
have
had
an
origin
,
and
to
have
been
at
one
time
or
other
of
an
importance
which
can
not
fail
to
render
them
highly
improving
and
acceptable
acquaintance
to
all
right
-
minded
individuals
,
may
now
proceed
in
earnest
with
its
task
.
 
<EOS>
And
having
shown
that
they
must
have
had
,
by
reason
of
their
ancient
birth
,
a
pretty
large
share
in
the
foundation
and
increase
of
the
human
family
,
it
will
one
day
become
its
province
to
submit
,
that
such
of
its
members
as
shall
be
introduced
in
these
pages
,
have
still
many
counterparts
and
prototypes
in
the
Great
World
about
us
.
 
<EOS>
At
present
it
contents
itself
with
remarking
,
in
a
general
way
,
on
this
head
:
<EOS>
Firstly
,
that
it
may
be
safely
asserted
,
and
yet
without
implying
any
direct
participation
in
the
Manboddo
doctrine
touching
the
probability
of
the
human
race
having
once
been
monkeys
,
that
men
do
play
very
strange
and
extraordinary
tricks
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
and
yet
without
trenching
on
the
Blumenbach
theory
as
to
the
descendants
of
Adam
having
a
vast
number
of
qualities
which
belong
more
particularly
to
swine
than
to
any
other
class
of
animals
in
the
creation
,
that
some
men
certainly
are
remarkable
for
taking
uncommon
good
care
of
themselves
.

Wherein
certain
persons
are
presented
to
the
reader
,
with
whom
he
may
,

he
please
,
become
better
acquainted
 
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
late
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
,
when
the
declining
sun
struggling
through
the
mist
which
had
obscured
it
all
day
,
looked
brightly
down
upon
a
little
Wiltshire
village
,
within
an
easy
journey
of
the
fair
old
town
of
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
Like
a
sudden
flash
of
memory
or
spirit
kindling
up
the
mind
of
an
old
man
,
it
shed
a
glory
upon
the
scene
,
in
which
its
departed
youth
and
freshness
seemed
to
live
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
wet
grass
sparkled
in
the
light
;
the
scanty
patches
of
verdure
in
the
hedges
---
where
a
few
green
twigs
yet
stood
together
bravely
,
resisting
to
the
last
the
tyranny
of
nipping
winds
and
early
frosts
---
took
heart
and
brightened
up
;
the
stream
which
had
been
dull
and
sullen
all
day
long
,
broke
out
into
a
cheerful
smile
;
the
birds
began
to
chirp
and
twitter
on
the
naked
boughs
,
as
though
the
hopeful
creatures
half
believed
that
winter
had
gone
by
,
and
spring
had
come
already
.
 
<EOS>
The
vane
upon
the
tapering
spire
of
the
old
church
glistened
from
its
lofty
station
in
sympathy
with
the
general
gladness
;
and
from
the
ivy
-
shaded
windows
such
gleams
of
light
shone
back
upon
the
glowing
sky
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
quiet
buildings
were
the
hoarding
-
place
of
twenty
summers
,
and
all
their
ruddiness
and
warmth
were
stored
within
.
   
<EOS>
Even
those
tokens
of
the
season
which
emphatically
whispered
of
the
coming
winter
,
graced
the
landscape
,
and
,
for
the
moment
,
tinged
its
livelier
features
with
no
oppressive
air
of
sadness
.
 
<EOS>
The
fallen
leaves
,
with
which
the
ground
was
strewn
,
gave
forth
a
pleasant
fragrance
,
and
subduing
all
harsh
sounds
of
distant
feet
and
wheels
created
a
repose
in
gentle
unison
with
the
light
scattering
of
seed
hither
and
thither
by
the
distant
husbandman
,
and
with
the
noiseless
passage
of
the
plough
as
it
turned
up
the
rich
brown
earth
,
and
wrought
a
graceful
pattern
in
the
stubbled
fields
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
motionless
branches
of
some
trees
,
autumn
berries
hung
like
clusters
of
coral
beads
,
as
in
those
fabled
orchards
where
the
fruits
were
jewels
;
others
stripped
of
all
their
garniture
,
stood
,
each
the
centre
of
its
little
heap
of
bright
red
leaves
,
watching
their
slow
decay
;
others
again
,
still
wearing
theirs
,
had
them
all
crunched
and
crackled
up
,
as
though
they
had
been
burnt
;
about
the
stems
of
some
were
piled
,
in
ruddy
mounds
,
the
apples
they
had
borne
that
year
;
while
others
(
hardy
evergreens
this
class
)
showed
somewhat
stern
and
gloomy
in
their
vigour
,
as
charged
by
nature
with
the
admonition
that
it
is
not
to
her
more
sensitive
and
joyous
favourites
she
grants
the
longest
term
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Still
athwart
their
darker
boughs
,
the
sunbeams
struck
out
paths
of
deeper
gold
;
and
the
red
light
,
mantling
in
among
their
swarthy
branches
,
used
them
as
foils
to
set
its
brightness
off
,
and
aid
the
lustre
of
the
dying
day
.
   
<EOS>
A
moment
,
and
its
glory
was
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
went
down
beneath
the
long
dark
lines
of
hill
and
cloud
which
piled
up
in
the
west
an
airy
city
,
wall
heaped
on
wall
,
and
battlement
on
battlement
;
the
light
was
all
withdrawn
;
the
shining
church
turned
cold
and
dark
;
the
stream
forgot
to
smile
;
the
birds
were
silent
;
and
the
gloom
of
winter
dwelt
on
everything
.
   
<EOS>
An
evening
wind
uprose
too
,
and
the
slighter
branches
cracked
and
rattled
as
they
moved
,
in
skeleton
dances
,
to
its
moaning
music
.
<EOS>
The
withering
leaves
no
longer
quiet
,
hurried
to
and
fro
in
search
of
shelter
from
its
chill
pursuit
;
the
labourer
unyoked
his
horses
,
and
with
head
bent
down
,
trudged
briskly
home
beside
them
;
and
from
the
cottage
windows
lights
began
to
glance
and
wink
upon
the
darkening
fields
.
   
<EOS>
Then
the
village
forge
came
out
in
all
its
bright
importance
.
 
<EOS>
The
lusty
bellows
roared
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
<EOS>
to
the
clear
fire
,
which
roared
in
turn
,
and
bade
the
shining
sparks
dance
gaily
to
the
merry
clinking
of
the
hammers
on
the
anvil
.
 
<EOS>
The
gleaming
iron
,
in
its
emulation
,
sparkled
too
,
and
shed
its
red
-
hot
gems
around
profusely
.
 
<EOS>
The
strong
smith
and
his
men
dealt
such
strokes
upon
their
work
,
as
made
even
the
melancholy
night
rejoice
,
and
brought
a
glow
into
its
dark
face
as
it
hovered
about
the
door
and
windows
,
peeping
curiously
in
above
the
shoulders
of
a
dozen
loungers
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
this
idle
company
,
there
they
stood
,
spellbound
by
the
place
,
and
,
casting
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
glance
upon
the
darkness
in
their
rear
,
settled
their
lazy
elbows
more
at
ease
upon
the
sill
,
and
leaned
a
little
further
in
:
no
more
disposed
to
tear
themselves
away
than
if
they
had
been
born
to
cluster
round
the
blazing
hearth
like
so
many
crickets
.
   
<EOS>
Out
upon
the
angry
wind
!
<EOS>
how
from
sighing
,
it
began
to
bluster
round
the
merry
forge
,
banging
at
the
wicket
,
and
grumbling
in
the
chimney
,
as
if
it
bullied
the
jolly
bellows
for
doing
anything
to
order
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
an
impotent
swaggerer
it
was
too
,
for
all
its
noise
;
for
if
it
had
any
influence
on
that
hoarse
companion
,
it
was
but
<EOS>
to
make
him
roar
his
cheerful
song
the
louder
,
and
by
consequence
to
make
the
fire
burn
the
brighter
,
and
the
sparks
to
dance
more
gaily
yet
;
at
length
,
they
whizzed
so
madly
round
and
round
,
that
it
was
too
much
for
such
a
surly
wind
to
bear
;
so
off
<EOS>
it
flew
with
a
howl
giving
the
old
sign
before
the
ale
-
house
door
such
a
cuff
as
it
went
,
that
the
Blue
Dragon
was
more
rampant
than
usual
ever
afterwards
,
and
indeed
,
before
Christmas
,
reared
clean
out
of
its
crazy
frame
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
small
tyranny
for
a
respectable
wind
to
go
wreaking
its
vengeance
on
such
poor
creatures
as
the
fallen
leaves
,
but
this
wind
happening
to
come
up
with
a
great
heap
of
them
just
after
venting
its
humour
on
the
insulted
Dragon
,
did
so
disperse
and
scatter
them
that
they
fled
away
,
pell
-
mell
,
some
here
,
some
there
,
rolling
over
each
other
,
whirling
round
and
round
upon
their
thin
edges
,
taking
frantic
flights
into
the
air
,
and
playing
all
manner
of
extraordinary
gambols
in
the
extremity
of
their
distress
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
enough
for
its
malicious
fury
;
for
not
content
with
driving
them
abroad
,
it
charged
small
parties
of
them
and
hunted
them
into
the
wheel
-
wright
's
saw
-
pit
,
and
below
the
planks
and
timbers
in
the
yard
,
and
,
scattering
the
sawdust
in
the
air
,
it
looked
for
them
underneath
,
and
when
it
did
meet
with
any
,
whew
!
<EOS>
how
it
drove
them
on
and
followed
at
their
heels
!
   
<EOS>
The
scared
leaves
only
flew
the
faster
for
all
this
,
and
a
giddy
chase
it
was
;
for
they
got
into
unfrequented
places
,
where
there
was
no
outlet
,
and
where
their
pursuer
kept
them
eddying
round
and
round
at
his
pleasure
;
and
they
crept
under
the
eaves
of
houses
,
and
clung
tightly
to
the
sides
of
hay
-
ricks
,
like
bats
;
and
tore
in
at
open
chamber
windows
,
and
cowered
close
to
hedges
;
and
,
in
short
,
went
anywhere
for
safety
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
oddest
feat
they
achieved
was
,
to
take
advantage
of
the
sudden
opening
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
front
-
door
,
to
dash
wildly
into
his
passage
;
whither
the
wind
following
close
upon
them
,
and
finding
the
back
-
door
open
,
incontinently
blew
out
the
lighted
candle
held
by
Miss
Pecksniff
,
and
slammed
the
front
-
door
against
Mr
Pecksniff
who
was
at
that
moment
entering
,
with
such
violence
,
that
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
lay
on
his
back
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
.
 
<EOS>
Being
by
this
time
weary
of
such
trifling
performances
,
the
boisterous
rover
hurried
away
rejoicing
,
roaring
over
moor
and
meadow
,
hill
and
flat
,
until
it
got
out
to
sea
,
where
it
met
with
other
winds
similarly
disposed
,
and
made
a
night
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mr
Pecksniff
,
having
received
from
a
sharp
angle
in
the
bottom
step
but
one
,
that
sort
of
knock
on
the
head
which
lights
up
,
for
the
patient
's
entertainment
,
an
imaginary
general
illumination
of
very
bright
short
-
sixes
,
lay
placidly
staring
at
his
own
street
door
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
would
seem
to
have
been
more
suggestive
in
its
aspect
than
street
doors
usually
are
;
for
he
continued
to
lie
there
,
rather
a
lengthy
and
unreasonable
time
,
without
so
much
as
wondering
whether
he
was
hurt
or
no
;
neither
,
when
Miss
Pecksniff
inquired
through
the
key
-
hole
in
a
shrill
voice
,
which
might
have
belonged
to
a
wind
in
its
teens
,
"
Who
's
there
"
did
he
make
any
reply
;
nor
,
when
Miss
Pecksniff
opened
the
door
again
,
and
shading
the
candle
with
her
hand
,
peered
out
,
and
looked
provokingly
round
him
,
and
about
him
,
and
over
him
,
and
everywhere
but
at
him
,
did
he
offer
any
remark
,
or
indicate
in
any
manner
the
least
hint
of
a
desire
to
be
picked
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
,
"
cried
Miss
Pecksniff
,
to
the
ideal
inflicter
of
a
runaway
knock
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
catch
it
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Still
Mr
Pecksniff
,
perhaps
from
having
caught
it
already
,
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
round
the
corner
now
,
"
cried
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
it
at
a
venture
,
but
there
was
appropriate
matter
in
it
too
;
for
Mr
Pecksniff
,
being
in
the
act
of
extinguishing
the
candles
before
mentioned
pretty
rapidly
,
and
of
reducing
the
number
of
brass
knobs
on
his
street
door
from
four
or
five
hundred
(
which
had
previously
been
juggling
of
their
own
accord
before
his
eyes
in
a
very
novel
manner
)
to
a
dozen
or
so
<EOS>
,
might
in
one
sense
have
been
said
to
be
coming
round
the
corner
,
and
just
turning
it
.
   
<EOS>
With
a
sharply
delivered
warning
relative
to
the
cage
and
the
constable
,
and
the
stocks
and
the
gallows
,
Miss
Pecksniff
was
about
to
close
the
door
again
,
when
Mr
Pecksniff
(
being
still
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
)
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
,
and
sneezed
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
voice
!
"
cried
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
parent
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
exclamation
,
another
Miss
Pecksniff
bounced
out
of
the
parlour
;
and
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
with
many
incoherent
expressions
,
dragged
Mr
Pecksniff
into
an
upright
posture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pa
!
"
<EOS>
they
cried
in
concert
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pa
!
<EOS>
Speak
,
Pa
!
 
<EOS>
Do
not
look
so
wild
my
dearest
Pa
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
as
a
gentleman
's
looks
,
in
such
a
case
of
all
others
,
are
by
no
means
under
his
own
control
,
Mr
Pecksniff
continued
to
keep
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
very
wide
open
,
and
to
drop
his
lower
jaw
,
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
a
toy
nut
-
cracker
;
and
as
his
hat
had
fallen
off
,
and
his
face
was
pale
,
and
his
hair
erect
,
and
his
coat
muddy
,
the
spectacle
he
presented
was
so
very
doleful
,
that
neither
of
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
could
repress
an
involuntary
screech
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
'll
do
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
come
to
himself
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
youngest
Miss
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
speaks
again
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
eldest
.
   
<EOS>
With
these
joyful
words
they
kissed
Mr
Pecksniff
on
either
cheek
;
and
bore
him
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
the
youngest
Miss
Pecksniff
ran
out
again
to
pick
up
his
hat
,
his
brown
paper
parcel
,
his
umbrella
,
his
gloves
,
and
other
small
articles
;
and
that
done
,
and
the
door
closed
,
both
young
ladies
applied
themselves
to
tending
Mr
Pecksniff
's
wounds
in
the
back
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
not
very
serious
in
their
nature
;
being
limited
to
abrasions
on
what
the
eldest
Miss
Pecksniff
called
"
the
knobby
parts
"
of
her
parent
's
anatomy
,
such
as
his
knees
and
elbows
,
and
to
the
development
of
an
entirely
new
organ
,
unknown
to
phrenologists
,
on
the
back
of
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
These
injuries
having
been
comforted
externally
,
with
patches
of
pickled
brown
paper
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
having
been
comforted
internally
,
with
some
stiff
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
the
eldest
Miss
Pecksniff
sat
down
to
make
the
tea
,
which
was
all
ready
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
youngest
Miss
Pecksniff
brought
from
the
kitchen
a
smoking
dish
of
ham
and
eggs
,
and
,
setting
the
same
before
her
father
,
took
up
her
station
on
a
low
stool
at
his
feet
;
thereby
bringing
her
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
teaboard
.
   
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
inferred
from
this
position
of
humility
,
that
the
youngest
Miss
Pecksniff
was
so
young
as
to
be
,
as
one
may
say
,
forced
to
sit
upon
a
stool
,
by
reason
of
the
shortness
of
her
legs
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
sat
upon
a
stool
because
of
her
simplicity
and
innocence
,
which
were
very
great
,
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
sat
upon
a
stool
because
she
was
all
girlishness
,
and
playfulness
,
and
wildness
,
and
kittenish
buoyancy
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
the
most
arch
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
artless
creature
,
was
the
youngest
Miss
Pecksniff
,
that
you
can
possibly
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
her
great
charm
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
fresh
and
guileless
,
and
too
full
of
child
-
like
vivacity
,
was
the
youngest
Miss
Pecksniff
,
to
wear
combs
in
her
hair
,
or
to
turn
it
up
,
or
to
frizzle
it
,
or
braid
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
wore
it
in
a
crop
,
a
loosely
flowing
crop
,
which
had
so
many
rows
of
curls
in
it
,
that
the
top
row
was
only
one
curl
.
 
<EOS>
Moderately
buxom
was
her
shape
,
and
quite
womanly
too
;
but
sometimes
---
yes
,
sometimes
<EOS>
---
she
even
wore
a
pinafore
;
and
how
charming
THAT
was
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
was
indeed
"
a
gushing
thing
"
(
as
a
young
gentleman
had
observed
in
verse
,
in
the
Poet
's
Corner
of
a
provincial
newspaper
)
,
was
the
youngest
Miss
Pecksniff
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
a
moral
man
---
a
grave
man
,
a
man
of
noble
sentiments
and
speech
---
and
he
had
had
her
christened
Mercy
.
 
<EOS>
Mercy
!
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
charming
name
for
such
a
pure
-
souled
Being
as
the
youngest
Miss
Pecksniff
!
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
's
name
was
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
thing
!
<EOS>
Mercy
and
Charity
!
 
<EOS>
And
Charity
,
with
her
fine
strong
sense
and
her
mild
,
yet
not
reproachful
gravity
,
was
so
well
named
,
and
did
so
well
set
off
and
illustrate
her
sister
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
pleasant
sight
was
that
the
contrast
they
presented
;
to
see
each
loved
and
loving
one
sympathizing
with
,
and
devoted
to
,
and
leaning
on
,
and
yet
correcting
and
counter
-
checking
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
antidoting
,
the
other
!
 
<EOS>
To
behold
each
damsel
in
her
very
admiration
of
her
sister
,
setting
up
in
business
for
herself
on
an
entirely
different
principle
,
and
announcing
no
connection
with
over
-
the
-
way
,
and
if
the
quality
of
goods
at
that
establishment
do
n't
please
you
,
you
are
respectfully
invited
to
favour
ME
with
a
call
!
 
<EOS>
And
the
crowning
circumstance
of
the
whole
delightful
catalogue
was
,
that
both
the
fair
creatures
were
so
utterly
unconscious
of
all
this
!
 
<EOS>
They
had
no
idea
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
no
more
thought
or
dreamed
of
it
than
Mr
Pecksniff
did
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
played
them
off
against
each
other
;
THEY
had
no
hand
in
it
,
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
.
   
<EOS>
It
has
been
remarked
that
Mr
Pecksniff
was
a
moral
man
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
was
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
never
was
a
more
moral
man
than
Mr
Pecksniff
,
especially
in
his
conversation
and
correspondence
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
once
said
of
him
by
a
homely
admirer
,
that
he
had
a
Fortunatus
's
purse
of
good
sentiments
in
his
inside
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
particular
he
was
like
the
girl
in
the
fairy
tale
,
except
that
if
they
were
not
actual
diamonds
which
fell
from
his
lips
,
they
were
the
very
brightest
paste
,
and
shone
prodigiously
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
most
exemplary
man
;
fuller
of
virtuous
precept
than
a
copy
book
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
likened
him
to
a
direction
-
post
,
which
is
always
telling
the
way
to
a
place
,
and
never
goes
there
;
but
these
were
his
enemies
,
the
shadows
cast
by
his
brightness
;
that
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
His
very
throat
was
moral
.
 
<EOS>
You
saw
a
good
deal
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
looked
over
a
very
low
fence
of
white
cravat
<EOS>
(
whereof
no
man
had
ever
beheld
the
tie
for
he
fastened
it
behind
)
,
and
there
it
lay
,
<EOS>
a
valley
between
two
jutting
heights
of
collar
,
serene
and
whiskerless
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
say
,
on
the
part
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
There
is
no
deception
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
all
is
peace
,
a
holy
calm
pervades
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
did
his
hair
,
just
grizzled
with
an
iron
-
grey
which
was
all
brushed
off
his
forehead
,
and
stood
bolt
upright
,
or
slightly
drooped
in
kindred
action
with
his
heavy
eyelids
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
his
person
,
which
was
sleek
though
free
from
corpulency
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
his
manner
,
which
was
soft
and
oily
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
even
his
plain
black
suit
,
and
state
of
widower
and
dangling
double
eye
-
glass
,
all
tended
to
the
same
purpose
,
and
cried
aloud
,
"
Behold
the
moral
Pecksniff
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
brazen
plate
upon
the
door
(
which
being
Mr
Pecksniff
's
,
could
not
lie
)
<EOS>
bore
this
inscription
,
"
PECKSNIFF
,
ARCHITECT
,
"
to
which
Mr
Pecksniff
,
on
his
cards
of
business
,
added
,
AND
LAND
SURVEYOR
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
In
one
sense
,
and
only
one
,
he
may
be
said
to
have
been
a
Land
Surveyor
on
a
pretty
large
scale
,
as
an
extensive
prospect
lay
<EOS>
stretched
out
before
the
windows
of
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
Of
his
architectural
doings
,
nothing
was
clearly
known
,
except
that
he
had
never
designed
or
built
anything
;
but
it
was
generally
understood
that
his
knowledge
of
the
science
was
almost
awful
in
its
profundity
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
's
professional
engagements
,
indeed
,
were
almost
,
if
not
entirely
,
confined
to
the
reception
of
pupils
;
for
the
collection
of
rents
,
with
which
pursuit
he
occasionally
varied
and
relieved
his
graver
toils
,
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
a
strictly
architectural
employment
.
 
<EOS>
His
genius
lay
in
ensnaring
parents
and
guardians
,
and
pocketing
premiums
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
gentleman
's
premium
being
paid
,
and
the
young
gentleman
come
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
,
Mr
Pecksniff
borrowed
his
case
of
mathematical
instruments
(
if
silver
-
mounted
or
otherwise
valuable
)
;
entreated
him
,
from
that
moment
,
to
consider
himself
one
of
the
family
;
complimented
him
highly
on
his
parents
or
guardians
,
as
the
case
might
be
;
and
turned
him
loose
in
a
spacious
room
on
the
two
-
pair
front
;
where
,
in
the
company
of
certain
drawing
-
boards
,
parallel
rulers
,
very
stiff
-
legged
compasses
,
and
two
,
or
perhaps
three
,
other
young
gentlemen
,
he
improved
himself
,
for
three
or
five
years
,
according
to
his
articles
,
in
making
elevations
of
Salisbury
Cathedral
from
every
possible
point
of
sight
;
and
in
constructing
in
the
air
a
vast
quantity
of
Castles
,
Houses
of
Parliament
,
and
other
Public
Buildings
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
in
no
place
in
the
world
were
so
many
gorgeous
edifices
of
this
class
erected
as
under
Mr
Pecksniff
's
auspices
;
and
if
but
one
-
twentieth
part
of
the
churches
which
were
built
in
that
front
room
,
with
one
or
other
of
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
at
the
altar
in
the
act
of
marrying
the
architect
,
could
only
be
made
available
by
the
parliamentary
commissioners
,
no
more
churches
would
be
wanted
for
at
least
five
centuries
.
   
<EOS>
"
Even
the
worldly
goods
of
which
we
have
just
disposed
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
glancing
round
the
table
when
he
had
finished
,
"
even
cream
,
sugar
,
tea
,
toast
,
ham
---
<EOS>

<EOS>
And
eggs

suggested
Charity
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
eggs
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
even
they
have
their
moral
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
they
come
and
go
!
 
<EOS>
Every
pleasure
is
transitory

<EOS>
We
ca
n't
even
eat

If
we
indulge
in
harmless
fluids
,
we
get
the
dropsy
;
if
in
exciting
liquids
,
we
get
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
soothing
reflection
is
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
WE
get
drunk
,
Pa
,
"
urged
the
eldest
Miss
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
say
we
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
her
father
,
"
I
mean
mankind
in
general
;
the
human
race

considered
as
a
body

and
not
as
individuals

<EOS>
There
is
nothing
personal
in
morality
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Even
such
a
thing
as
this
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
laying
the
fore
-
finger
of
his
left
hand
upon
the
brown
paper
patch
on
the
top
of
his
head
,
"
slight
casual
baldness
though
it
be

reminds
us
that
we
are
but

---
 
<EOS>
he
was
going
to
say
"
worms
,
"
but
recollecting
that
worms
were
not
remarkable
for
heads
of
hair
,
he
substituted
"
flesh
and
blood
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
after
a
pause
,
during
which
he
seemed
to
have
been
casting
about
for
a
new
moral
,
and
not
quite
successfully
,
"
which
is
also
very
soothing
.
 
<EOS>
Mercy
,
my
dear
,
stir
the
fire
and
throw
up
the
cinders
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
lady
obeyed
,
and
having
done
so
,
resumed
her
stool
,
reposed
one
arm
upon
her
father
's
knee
,
and
laid
her
blooming
cheek
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
drew
her
chair
nearer
the
fire
,
as
one
prepared
for
conversation
,
and
looked
towards
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
after
a
short
pause
,
during
which
he
had
been
silently
smiling
,
and
shaking
his
head
at
the
fire
---
"
I
have
again
been
fortunate

A

A

asked
Charity

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye

said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
avail
himself
of
the
eligible
opportunity
which
now
offers
,
for
uniting
the
advantages
of
the
best
practical
architectural
education
with
the
comforts
of
a
home
,
and
the
constant
association
with
some
who
(
however
humble
their
sphere
,
and
limited
their
capacity
)
are
not
unmindful
of
their
moral
responsibilities
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
Pa

<EOS>
cried
Mercy
,
holding
up
her
finger
archly
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
advertisement

<EOS>
"
Playful
---
playful
warbler
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
observed
in
connection
with
his
calling
his
daughter
a
"
warbler
,
"
that
she
was
not
at
all
vocal
,
but
that
Mr
Pecksniff
was
in
the
frequent
habit
of
using
any
word
that
occurred
to
him
as
having
a
good
sound
,
and
rounding
a
sentence
well
without
much
care
for
its
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
did
this
so
boldly
,
and
in
such
an
imposing
manner
,
that
he
would
sometimes
stagger
the
wisest
people
with
his
eloquence
,
and
make
them
gasp
again
.
   
<EOS>
His
enemies
asserted
,
by
the
way
,
that
a
strong
trustfulness
in
sounds
and
forms
was
the
master
-
key
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
character
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
handsome
,
Pa
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
younger
daughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silly
Merry
!
"
said
the
eldest
:
Merry
being
fond
for
Mercy
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
premium
,
Pa
?
<EOS>
tell
us
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
good
gracious
,
Cherry
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Miss
Mercy
,
holding
up
her
hands
with
the
most
winning
giggle
in
the
world
,
"
what
a
mercenary
girl
you
are
!
<EOS>
oh
you
naughty
,
thoughtful
,
prudent
thing
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
charming
,
and
worthy
of
the
Pastoral
age
,
to
see
how
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
slapped
each
other
after
this
,
and
then
subsided
into
an
embrace
expressive
of
their
different
dispositions
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
well
looking
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
slowly
and
distinctly
;
"
well
looking
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
positively
expect
any
immediate
premium
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
their
different
natures
,
both
Charity
and
Mercy
concurred
in
opening
their
eyes
uncommonly
wide
at
this
announcement
,
and
in
looking
for
the
moment
as
blank
as
if
their
thoughts
had
actually
had
a
direct
bearing
on
the
main
chance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
what
of
that
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
still
smiling
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
disinterestedness
in
the
world
,
I
hope
?
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
all
arrayed
in
two
opposite
ranks
:
the
offensive
and
the
defensive

<EOS>
Some
few

walk
between

who
help
the
needy
as
they
go
;
and
take
no
part
with
either
side
?
 
<EOS>
umph

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
these
morsels
of
philanthropy
which
reassured
the
sisters
.
 
<EOS>
They
exchanged
glances
,
and
brightened
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
let
us
not
be
for
ever
calculating
,
devising
,
and
plotting
for
the
future
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
smiling
more
and
more
,
and
looking
at
the
fire
as
a
man
might
,
who
was
cracking
a
joke
with
it
:
"
I
am
weary
of
such
arts
.
 
<EOS>
If
our
inclinations
are
but
good
and
open
-
hearted
,
let
us
gratify
them
boldly
,
though
they
bring
upon
us
Loss
instead
of
Profit
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
Charity
?
"
   
<EOS>
Glancing
towards
his
daughters
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
begun
these
reflections
,
and
seeing
that
they
both
smiled
,
Mr
Pecksniff
eyed
them
for
an
instant
so
jocosely
(
though
still
with
a
kind
of
saintly
waggishness
)
that
the
younger
one
was
moved
to
sit
upon
his
knee
forthwith
,
put
her
fair
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
kiss
him
twenty
times
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
this
affectionate
display
she
laughed
to
a
most
immoderate
extent
:
in
which
hilarious
indulgence
even
the
prudent
Cherry
joined
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
pushing
his
latest
-
born
away
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
hair
,
as
he
resumed
his
tranquil
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
folly
is
this
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
take
heed
how
we
laugh
without
reason
lest
we
cry
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
domestic
news
since
yesterday
?
 
<EOS>
John
Westlock
is
gone
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
no
,
"
said
Charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
not
?
"
returned
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
term
expired
yesterday
.
<EOS>
And
his
box
was
packed
,
I
know
;
for
I
saw
it
,
in
the
morning
,
standing
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
slept
last
night
at
the
Dragon
,
"
returned
the
young
lady
,
"
and
had
Mr
Pinch
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
spent
the
evening
together
,
and
Mr
Pinch
was
not
home
till
very
late
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
saw
him
on
the
stairs
this
morning
,
Pa
,
"
said
Mercy
with
her
usual
sprightliness
,
"
he
looked
,
oh
goodness
,
SUCH
a
monster
!
<EOS>
with
his
face
all
manner
of
colours
,
and
his
eyes
as
dull
as
if
they
had
been
boiled
,
and
his
head
aching
dreadfully
,
I
am
sure
from
the
look
of
it
,
and
his
clothes
smelling
,
<EOS>
oh
it
's
impossible
to
say
how
strong
,
<EOS>
oh
"
---
here
the
young
lady
shuddered
---
"
of
smoke
and
punch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
think
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
with
his
accustomed
gentleness
,
though
still
with
the
air
of
one
who
suffered
under
injury
without
complaint
,
"
<EOS>
I
think
Mr
Pinch
might
have
done
better
than
choose
for
his
companion
one
who
,
at
the
close
of
a
long
intercourse
,
had
endeavoured
,
as
he
knew
,
to
wound
my
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
quite
sure
that
this
was
delicate
in
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
quite
sure
that
this
was
kind
in
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
further
and
say
,
I
am
not
quite
sure
that
this
was
even
ordinarily
grateful
in
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
anyone
expect
from
Mr
Pinch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Charity
,
with
as
strong
and
scornful
an
emphasis
on
the
name
as
if
it
would
have
given
her
unspeakable
pleasure
to
express
it
,
in
an
acted
charade
,
on
the
calf
of
that
gentleman
's
leg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
returned
her
father
,
raising
his
hand
mildly
:
"
it
is
very
well
to
say
what
can
we
expect
from
Mr
Pinch
,
but
Mr
Pinch
is
a
fellow
-
creature
,
my
dear
;
Mr
Pinch
is
an
item
in
the
vast
total
of
humanity
,
my
love
;
and
we
have
a
right
,
it
is
our
duty
,
to
expect
in
Mr
Pinch
some
development
of
those
better
qualities
,
the
possession
of
which
in
our
own
persons
inspires
our
humble
self
-
respect
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
"
continued
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should
say
,
nothing
can
be
expected
from
Mr
Pinch
;
or
that
I
should
say
,
nothing
can
be
expected
from
any
man
alive
(
even
the
most
degraded
,
which
Mr
Pinch
is
not
,
no
,
really
)
;
but
Mr
Pinch
has
disappointed
me
;
he
has
hurt
me
;
I
think
a
little
the
worse
of
him
on
this
account
,
but
not
if
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Charity
,
holding
up
her
finger
,
as
a
gentle
rap
was
heard
at
the
street
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
creature
!
 
<EOS>
Now
mark
my
words
,
he
has
come
back
with
John
Westlock
for
his
box
,
and
is
going
to
help
him
to
take
it
to
the
mail
.
 
<EOS>
Only
mark
my
words
,
if
that
is
n't
his
intention
!
"
   
<EOS>
Even
as
she
spoke
,
the
box
appeared
to
be
in
progress
of
conveyance
from
the
house
,
but
after
a
brief
murmuring
of
question
and
answer
,
it
was
put
down
again
,
and
somebody
knocked
at
the
parlour
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
---
not
severely
;
only
virtuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
An
ungainly
,
awkward
-
looking
man
,
extremely
short
-
sighted
,
and
prematurely
bald
,
availed
himself
of
this
permission
;
and
seeing
that
Mr
Pecksniff
sat
with
his
back
towards
him
,
gazing
at
the
fire
,
stood
hesitating
,
with
the
door
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
far
from
handsome
certainly
;
and
was
drest
in
a
snuff
-
coloured
suit
,
of
an
uncouth
make
at
the
best
,
which
,
being
shrunk
with
long
wear
,
was
twisted
and
tortured
into
all
kinds
of
odd
shapes
;
but
notwithstanding
his
attire
,
and
his
clumsy
figure
,
which
a
great
stoop
in
his
shoulders
,
and
a
ludicrous
habit
he
had
of
thrusting
his
head
forward
,
by
no
means
redeemed
,
one
would
not
have
been
disposed
(
unless
Mr
Pecksniff
said
so
)
to
consider
him
a
bad
fellow
by
any
means
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
perhaps
about
thirty
,
but
he
might
have
been
almost
any
age
between
sixteen
and
sixty
;
being
one
of
those
strange
creatures
who
never
decline
into
an
ancient
appearance
,
but
look
their
oldest
when
they
are
very
young
,
and
get
it
over
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
Keeping
his
hand
upon
the
lock
of
the
door
,
he
glanced
from
Mr
Pecksniff
to
Mercy
,
from
Mercy
to
Charity
,
and
from
Charity
to
Mr
Pecksniff
again
,
several
times
;
but
the
young
ladies
being
as
intent
upon
the
fire
as
their
father
was
,
and
neither
of
the
three
taking
any
notice
of
him
,
he
was
fain
to
say
,
at
last
,
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Pecksniff
:
I
beg
your
pardon
for
intruding
;
but
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
No
intrusion
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
that
gentleman
very
sweetly
,
but
without
looking
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
seated
,
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
to
shut
the
door
,
Mr
Pinch
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir
,
"
said
Pinch
;
not
doing
so
,
however
,
but
holding
it
rather
wider
open
than
before
,
and
beckoning
nervously
to
somebody
without
:
"
Mr
Westlock
,
sir
,
hearing
that
you
were
come
home
---
"
   
"
Mr
Pinch
,
Mr
Pinch
!
"
<EOS>
said
Pecksniff
,
wheeling
his
chair
about
,
and
looking
at
him
with
an
aspect
of
the
deepest
melancholy
,
"
I
did
not
expect
this
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
deserved
this
from
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
but
upon
my
word
,
sir
---
"
urged
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
less
you
say
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
interposed
the
other
,
"
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
utter
no
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
Make
no
defence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
but
do
have
the
goodness
,
sir
,
"
cried
Pinch
,
with
great
earnestness
,
"
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Westlock
,
sir
,
going
away
for
good
and
all
,
wishes
to
leave
none
but
friends
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Westlock
and
you
,
sir
,
had
a
little
difference
the
other
day
;
you
have
had
many
little
differences
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Little
differences
!
"
cried
Charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Little
differences
!
"
echoed
Mercy
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
loves
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
the
same
serene
upraising
of
his
hand
;
"
My
dears
!
"
 
<EOS>
After
a
solemn
pause
he
meekly
bowed
to
Mr
Pinch
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
Proceed
;
"
but
Mr
Pinch
was
so
very
much
at
a
loss
how
to
resume
,
and
looked
so
helplessly
at
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
that
the
conversation
would
most
probably
have
terminated
there
,
if
a
good
-
looking
youth
,
newly
arrived
at
man
's
estate
,
had
not
stepped
forward
from
the
doorway
and
taken
up
the
thread
of
the
discourse
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
smile
,
"
do
n't
let
there
be
any
ill
-
blood
between
us
,
pray
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
we
have
ever
differed
,
and
extremely
sorry
I
have
ever
given
you
offence
.
 
<EOS>
Bear
me
<EOS>
no
ill
-
will
at
parting
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
bear
,
"
answered
Mr
Pecksniff
,
mildly
,
"
no
ill
-
will
to
any
man
on
earth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
he
did
n't
,
"
said
Pinch
,
in
an
undertone
;
"
I
knew
he
did
n't
!
<EOS>
He
always
says
he
do
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
shake
hands
,
sir
?
"
cried
Westlock
,
advancing
a
step
or
two
,
and
bespeaking
Mr
Pinch
's
close
attention
by
a
glance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Umph
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
his
most
winning
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
shake
hands
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
John
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
calmness
quite
ethereal
;
"
<EOS>
no
,
I
will
not
shake
hands
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
forgiven
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
already
forgiven
you
,
even
before
you
ceased
to
reproach
and
taunt
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
embraced
you
in
the
spirit
,
John
,
which
is
better
than
shaking
hands
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pinch
,
"
said
the
youth
,
turning
towards
him
,
with
a
hearty
disgust
of
his
late
master
,
"
what
did
I
tell
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Pinch
looked
down
uneasily
at
Mr
Pecksniff
,
whose
eye
was
fixed
upon
him
as
it
had
been
from
the
first
;
and
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
again
,
made
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
your
forgiveness
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
said
the
youth
,
"
I
'll
not
have
it
upon
such
terms
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
,
John
?
"
retorted
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
Forgiveness
is
a
high
quality
;
an
exalted
virtue
;
far
above
YOUR
control
or
influence
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
I
WILL
forgive
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
move
me
to
remember
any
wrong
you
have
ever
done
me
,
John
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wrong
!
"
cried
the
other
,
with
all
the
heat
and
impetuosity
of
his
age
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
pretty
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
Wrong
!
 
<EOS>
Wrong
I
have
done
him
!
 
<EOS>
He
'll
not
even
remember
the
five
hundred
pounds
he
had
with
me
under
false
pretences
;
or
the
seventy
pounds
a
year
for
board
and
lodging
that
would
have
been
dear
at
seventeen
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
martyr
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Money
,
John
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
is
the
root
of
all
evil
.
 
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
see
that
it
is
already
bearing
evil
fruit
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
remember
its
existence
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
even
remember
the
conduct
of
that
misguided
person
"
---
and
here
,
although
he
spoke
like
one
at
peace
with
all
the
world
,
he
used
an
emphasis
that
plainly
said
"
I
have
my
eye
upon
the
rascal
now
"
---
"
that
misguided
person
who
has
brought
you
here
to
-
night
,
seeking
to
disturb
<EOS>
(
it
is
a
happiness
to
say
,
in
vain
)
<EOS>
the
heart
's
repose
and
peace
of
one
who
would
have
shed
his
dearest
blood
to
serve
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
voice
of
Mr
Pecksniff
trembled
as
he
spoke
,
and
sobs
were
heard
from
his
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
Sounds
floated
on
the
air
,
moreover
,
as
if
two
spirit
voices
had
exclaimed
:
one
,
"
Beast
!
"
<EOS>
the
other
,
"
Savage
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Forgiveness
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
entire
and
pure
forgiveness
is
not
incompatible
with
a
wounded
heart
;
perchance
<EOS>
when
the
heart
is
wounded
,
it
becomes
a
greater
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
With
my
breast
still
wrung
and
grieved
to
its
inmost
core
by
the
ingratitude
of
that
person
,
I
am
proud
and
glad
to
say
that
I
forgive
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
!
<EOS>
I
beg
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
raising
his
voice
,
as
Pinch
appeared
about
to
speak
,
"
<EOS>
I
beg
that
individual
not
to
offer
a
remark
;
he
will
truly
oblige
me
by
not
uttering
one
word
,
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
that
I
am
equal
to
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
very
short
space
of
time
,
I
shall
have
sufficient
fortitude
,
I
trust
to
converse
with
him
as
if
these
events
had
never
happened
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
turning
round
again
towards
the
fire
,
and
waving
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
door
,
"
not
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
cried
John
Westlock
,
with
the
utmost
disgust
and
disdain
the
monosyllable
is
capable
of
expressing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ladies
,
good
evening
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Pinch
<EOS>
,
it
's
not
worth
thinking
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
right
and
you
were
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
small
matter
;
you
'll
be
wiser
another
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
clapped
that
dejected
companion
on
the
shoulder
,
turned
upon
his
heel
,
and
walked
out
into
the
passage
,
whither
poor
Mr
Pinch
,
after
lingering
irresolutely
in
the
parlour
for
a
few
seconds
,
expressing
in
his
countenance
the
deepest
mental
misery
and
gloom
followed
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
took
up
the
box
between
them
,
and
sallied
out
to
meet
the
mail
.
   
<EOS>
That
fleet
conveyance
passed
,
every
night
,
the
corner
of
a
lane
at
some
distance
;
towards
which
point
they
bent
their
steps
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
they
walked
along
in
silence
,
until
at
length
young
Westlock
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
,
and
at
intervals
into
another
,
and
another
.
<EOS>
Still
there
was
no
response
from
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Pinch
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
abruptly
,
after
another
lengthened
silence
---
"
You
have
n't
half
enough
of
the
devil
in
you
.
<EOS>
Half
enough
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
n't
any
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Pinch
with
a
sigh
,
"
I
do
n't
know
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
compliment
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
n't
,
I
suppose
,
I
'm
all
the
better
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
the
better
!
"
repeated
his
companion
tartly
:
"
<EOS>
All
the
worse
,
you
mean
to
say
.
"
   
"
And
yet
,
"
said
Pinch
,
pursuing
his
own
thoughts
and
not
this
last
remark
on
the
part
of
his
friend
,
"
I
must
have
a
good
deal
of
what
you
call
the
devil
in
me
,
too
,
or
how
could
I
make
Pecksniff
so
uncomfortable
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
occasioned
him
so
much
distress
---
 
do
n't
laugh
,
please
---
for
a
mine
of
money
;
and
Heaven
knows
I
could
find
good
use
for
it
too
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
How
grieved
he
was
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
HE
grieved
!
"
returned
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
observe
that
the
tears
were
almost
starting
out
of
his
eyes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
,
John
,
is
it
nothing
to
see
a
man
moved
to
that
extent
and
know
one
's
self
to
be
the
cause
!
 
<EOS>
And
did
you
hear
him
say
that
he
could
have
shed
his
blood
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
WANT
any
blood
shed
for
you
?
"
returned
his
friend
,
with
considerable
irritation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Does
he
shed
anything
for
you
that
you
DO
want
?
 
<EOS>
Does
he
shed
employment
for
you
,
instruction
for
you
,
pocket
money
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
Does
he
shed
even
legs
of
mutton
for
you
in
any
decent
proportion
to
potatoes
and
garden
stuff
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Pinch
,
sighing
again
,
"
that
I
am
a
great
eater
;
I
ca
n't
disguise
from
myself
that
I
'm
a
great
eater
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
that
,
John
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
a
great
eater
!
"
retorted
his
companion
,
with
no
less
indignation
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
you
are
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
appeared
to
be
forcible
matter
in
this
inquiry
,
for
Mr
Pinch
only
repeated
in
an
undertone
that
he
had
a
strong
misgiving
on
the
subject
,
and
that
he
greatly
feared
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
whether
I
am
or
no
,
"
he
added
,
"
that
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
his
thinking
me
ungrateful
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
there
is
scarcely
a
sin
in
the
world
that
is
in
my
eyes
such
a
crying
one
as
ingratitude
;
and
when
he
taxes
me
with
that
,
and
believes
me
to
be
guilty
of
it
,
he
makes
me
miserable
and
wretched
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
do
n't
know
that
?
"
returned
the
other
scornfully
.
"
<EOS>
But
come
,
Pinch
,
before
I
say
anything
more
to
you
,
just
run
over
the
reasons
you
have
for
being
grateful
to
him
at
all
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
Change
hands
first
,
for
the
box
is
heavy
.
 
<EOS>
That
'll
do
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
"
said
Pinch
,
"
he
took
me
as
his
pupil
for
much
less
than
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
rejoined
his
friend
,
perfectly
unmoved
by
this
instance
of
generosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
in
the
second
place
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
What
in
the
second
place
?
"
cried
Pinch
,
in
a
sort
of
desperation
,
"
why
,
everything
in
the
second
place
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
old
grandmother
died
happy
to
think
that
she
had
put
me
with
such
an
excellent
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
grown
up
in
his
house
,
I
am
in
his
confidence
,
I
am
his
assistant
,
he
allows
me
a
salary
;
when
his
business
improves
,
my
prospects
are
to
improve
too
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
,
and
a
great
deal
more
,
is
in
the
second
place
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
the
very
prologue
and
preface
to
the
first
place
,
John
,
you
must
consider
this
,
which
nobody
knows
better
than
I
:
that
I
was
born
for
much
plainer
and
poorer
things
,
that
I
am
not
a
good
hand
for
his
kind
of
business
,
and
have
no
talent
for
it
,
or
indeed
for
anything
else
but
odds
and
ends
that
are
of
no
use
or
service
to
anybody
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
this
with
so
much
earnestness
,
and
in
a
tone
so
full
of
feeling
,
that
his
companion
instinctively
changed
his
manner
as
he
sat
down
on
the
box
(
they
had
by
this
time
reached
the
finger
-
post
at
the
end
of
the
lane
)
;
motioned
him
to
sit
down
beside
him
;
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
are
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
,
"
he
said
,
"
Tom
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
rejoined
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
only
knew
Pecksniff
as
well
as
I
do
,
you
might
say
it
of
him
,
indeed
,
and
say
it
truly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
say
anything
of
him
,
you
like
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
and
not
another
word
to
his
disparagement
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
my
sake
,
then
;
not
his
<EOS>
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Pinch
,
shaking
his
head
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
whose
you
please
,
Tom
,
so
that
it
does
please
you
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
famous
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
HE
never
scraped
and
clawed
into
his
pouch
all
your
poor
grandmother
's
hard
savings
<EOS>
---
she
was
a
housekeeper
,
was
n't
she
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
nursing
one
of
his
large
knees
,
and
nodding
his
head
;
"
a
gentleman
's
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
HE
never
scraped
and
clawed
into
his
pouch
all
her
hard
savings
;
dazzling
her
with
prospects
of
your
happiness
and
advancement
,
which
he
knew
(
and
no
man
better
)
never
would
be
realised
!
 
<EOS>
HE
never
speculated
and
traded
on
her
pride
in
you
,
and
her
having
educated
you
,
and
on
her
desire
that
you
at
least
should
live
to
be
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Not
he
,
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
,
looking
into
his
friend
's
face
,
as
if
he
were
a
little
doubtful
of
his
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
say
,
"
returned
the
youth
,
"
of
course
he
never
did
.
 
<EOS>
HE
did
n't
take
less
than
he
had
asked
,
because
that
less
was
all
she
had
,
and
more
than
he
expected
;
not
he
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
He
does
n't
keep
you
as
his
assistant
because
you
are
of
any
use
to
him
;
because
your
wonderful
faith
in
his
pretensions
is
of
inestimable
service
in
all
his
mean
disputes
;
because
your
honesty
reflects
honesty
on
him
;
because
your
wandering
about
this
little
place
all
your
spare
hours
,
reading
in
ancient
books
and
foreign
tongues
,
gets
noised
abroad
,
even
as
far
as
Salisbury
,
making
of
him
,
Pecksniff
the
master
,
a
man
of
learning
and
of
vast
importance
.
 
<EOS>
HE
gets
no
credit
from
you
,
Tom
,
not
he
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
he
do
n't
,
"
said
Pinch
,
gazing
at
his
friend
with
a
more
troubled
aspect
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pecksniff
get
credit
from
me
!
<EOS>
Well
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
say
that
it
's
ridiculous
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
"
even
to
think
of
such
a
thing
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
madness
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madness
!
"
returned
young
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
it
's
madness
.
 
<EOS>
Who
but
a
madman
would
suppose
he
cares
to
hear
it
said
on
Sundays
,
that
the
volunteer
who
plays
the
organ
in
the
church
,
and
practises
on
summer
evenings
in
the
dark
,
is
Mr
Pecksniff
's
young
man
,
eh
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
Who
but
a
madman
would
suppose
it
is
the
game
of
such
a
man
as
he
,
to
have
his
name
in
everybody
's
mouth
,
connected
with
the
thousand
useless
odds
and
ends
you
do
(
and
which
,
of
course
,
he
taught
you
)
,
eh
,
Tom
?
 
<EOS>
Who
but
a
madman
would
suppose
you
advertised
him
hereabouts
,
much
cheaper
and
much
better
than
a
chalker
on
the
walls
<EOS>
could
,
eh
,
Tom
?
 
<EOS>
As
well
might
one
suppose
that
he
does
n't
on
all
occasions
pour
out
his
whole
heart
and
soul
to
you
;
that
he
does
n't
make
you
a
very
liberal
and
indeed
rather
an
extravagant
allowance
;
or
,
to
be
more
wild
and
monstrous
still
,
if
that
be
possible
,
as
well
might
one
suppose
,
"
and
here
,
at
every
word
,
he
struck
him
lightly
on
the
breast
,
"
that
Pecksniff
traded
in
your
nature
,
and
that
your
nature
was
to
be
timid
and
distrustful
of
yourself
,
and
trustful
of
all
other
men
,
but
most
of
all
,
of
him
who
least
deserves
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
would
be
madness
,
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
had
listened
to
all
this
with
looks
of
bewilderment
,
which
seemed
to
be
in
part
occasioned
by
the
matter
of
his
companion
's
speech
,
and
in
part
by
his
rapid
and
vehement
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
he
had
come
to
a
close
,
he
drew
a
very
long
breath
;
and
gazing
wistfully
in
his
face
as
if
he
were
unable
to
settle
in
his
own
mind
what
expression
it
wore
,
and
were
desirous
to
draw
from
it
as
good
a
clue
to
his
real
meaning
as
it
was
possible
to
obtain
in
the
dark
,
was
about
to
answer
,
when
the
sound
of
the
mail
guard
's
horn
came
cheerily
upon
their
ears
,
putting
an
immediate
end
to
the
conference
;
greatly
as
it
seemed
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
younger
man
,
who
jumped
up
briskly
,
and
gave
his
hand
to
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Both
hands
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
write
to
you
from
London
,
mind
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
,
please
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
believe
you
're
going
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
,
now
,
but
yesterday
that
you
came
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
my
dear
old
fellow
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
returned
his
parting
words
with
no
less
heartiness
of
manner
,
and
sprung
up
to
his
seat
upon
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
Off
went
the
mail
at
a
canter
down
the
dark
road
;
the
lamps
gleaming
brightly
,
and
the
horn
awakening
all
the
echoes
,
far
and
wide
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
your
ways
,
"
said
Pinch
,
apostrophizing
the
coach
;
"
I
can
hardly
persuade
myself
but
you
're
alive
,
and
are
some
great
monster
who
visits
this
place
at
certain
intervals
,
to
bear
my
friends
away
into
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
more
exulting
and
rampant
than
usual
tonight
,
I
think
;
and
you
may
well
crow
over
your
prize
;
for
he
is
a
fine
lad
,
an
ingenuous
lad
,
and
has
but
one
fault
that
I
know
of
;
he
do
n't
mean
it
,
but
he
is
most
cruelly
unjust
to
Pecksniff
!

Chapter
03
.
<EOS>
In
which
certain
other
persons
are
introduced
;
on
the
same
terms
as
in
the
last
chapter
 
Mention
has
been
already
made
more
than
once
,
of
a
certain
Dragon
who
swung
and
creaked
complainingly
before
the
village
alehouse
door
.
 
<EOS>
A
faded
,
and
an
ancient
dragon
he
was
;
and
many
a
wintry
storm
of
rain
,
snow
,
sleet
,
and
hail
,
had
changed
his
colour
from
a
gaudy
blue
to
a
faint
lack
-
lustre
shade
of
grey
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
he
hung
;
rearing
,
in
a
state
of
monstrous
imbecility
,
on
his
hind
legs
;
waxing
,
with
every
month
that
passed
,
so
much
more
dim
and
shapeless
,
that
as
you
gazed
at
him
on
one
side
of
the
sign
-
board
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
be
gradually
melting
through
it
,
and
coming
out
upon
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
courteous
and
considerate
dragon
,
too
;
or
had
been
in
his
distincter
days
;
for
in
the
midst
of
his
rampant
feebleness
,
he
kept
one
of
his
forepaws
near
his
nose
,
as
though
he
would
say
,
"
Do
n't
mind
me
---
it
's
only
my
fun
;
"
while
he
held
out
the
other
in
polite
and
hospitable
entreaty
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
it
must
be
conceded
to
the
whole
brood
of
dragons
of
modern
times
,
that
they
have
made
a
great
advance
in
civilisation
and
refinement
.
 
<EOS>
They
no
longer
demand
a
beautiful
virgin
for
breakfast
every
morning
,
with
as
much
regularity
as
any
tame
single
gentleman
expects
his
hot
roll
,
but
rest
content
with
the
society
of
idle
bachelors
and
roving
married
men
;
and
they
are
now
remarkable
rather
for
holding
aloof
from
the
softer
sex
and
discouraging
their
visits
(
especially
on
Saturday
nights
)
,
than
for
rudely
insisting
on
their
company
without
any
reference
to
their
inclinations
,
as
they
are
known
to
have
done
in
days
of
yore
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
tribute
to
the
reclaimed
animals
in
question
so
wide
a
digression
into
the
realms
of
Natural
History
as
it
may
,
at
first
sight
,
appear
to
be
;
for
the
present
business
of
these
pages
in
with
the
dragon
who
had
his
retreat
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
neighbourhood
,
and
that
courteous
animal
being
already
on
the
carpet
,
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
its
immediate
transaction
.
   
<EOS>
For
many
years
,
then
,
he
had
swung
and
creaked
,
and
flapped
himself
about
,
before
the
two
windows
of
the
best
bedroom
of
that
house
of
entertainment
to
which
he
lent
his
name
;
but
never
in
all
his
swinging
,
creaking
,
and
flapping
,
had
there
been
such
a
stir
within
its
dingy
precincts
,
as
on
the
evening
next
after
that
upon
which
the
incidents
,
detailed
in
the
last
chapter
occurred
;
when
there
was
such
a
hurrying
up
and
down
stairs
of
feet
,
such
a
glancing
of
lights
,
such
a
whispering
of
voices
,
such
a
smoking
and
sputtering
of
wood
newly
lighted
in
a
damp
chimney
,
such
an
airing
of
linen
,
such
a
scorching
smell
of
hot
warming
-
pans
,
such
a
domestic
bustle
and
to
-
do
,
in
short
,
as
never
dragon
,
griffin
,
unicorn
,
or
other
animal
of
that
species
presided
over
,
since
they
first
began
to
interest
themselves
in
household
affairs
.
   
<EOS>
An
old
gentleman
and
a
young
lady
,
travelling
,
unattended
,
in
a
rusty
old
chariot
with
post
-
horses
;
coming
nobody
knew
whence
and
going
nobody
knew
whither
;
had
turned
out
of
the
high
road
,
and
driven
unexpectedly
to
the
Blue
Dragon
;
and
here
was
the
old
gentleman
,
who
had
taken
this
step
by
reason
of
his
sudden
illness
in
the
carriage
,
suffering
the
most
horrible
cramps
and
spasms
,
yet
protesting
and
vowing
in
the
very
midst
of
his
pain
,
that
he
would
n't
have
a
doctor
sent
for
,
and
would
n't
take
any
remedies
but
those
which
the
young
lady
administered
from
a
small
medicine
-
chest
,
and
would
n't
,
in
a
word
,
do
anything
but
terrify
the
landlady
out
of
her
five
wits
,
and
obstinately
refuse
compliance
with
every
suggestion
that
was
made
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
Of
all
the
five
hundred
proposals
for
his
relief
which
the
good
woman
poured
out
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
he
would
entertain
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
that
he
should
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
in
the
preparation
of
his
bed
and
the
arrangement
of
his
chamber
,
that
all
the
stir
was
made
in
the
room
behind
the
Dragon
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
,
beyond
all
question
,
very
ill
,
and
suffered
exceedingly
;
not
the
less
,
perhaps
,
because
he
was
a
strong
and
vigorous
old
man
,
with
a
will
of
iron
,
and
a
voice
of
brass
.
 
<EOS>
But
neither
the
apprehensions
which
he
plainly
entertained
,
at
times
,
for
his
life
,
nor
the
great
pain
he
underwent
,
influenced
his
resolution
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
no
person
sent
for
.
 
<EOS>
The
worse
he
grew
,
the
more
rigid
and
inflexible
<EOS>
he
became
in
his
determination
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
sent
for
any
person
to
attend
him
,
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
he
would
leave
the
house
directly
(
so
he
told
them
)
,
though
he
quitted
it
on
foot
,
and
died
upon
the
threshold
of
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
there
being
no
medical
practitioner
actually
resident
in
the
village
,
but
a
poor
apothecary
who
was
also
a
grocer
and
general
dealer
,
the
landlady
had
,
upon
her
own
responsibility
,
sent
for
him
,
in
the
very
first
burst
and
outset
of
the
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
it
followed
,
as
a
necessary
result
of
his
being
wanted
,
that
he
was
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gone
some
miles
away
,
and
was
not
expected
home
until
late
at
night
;
so
<EOS>
the
landlady
,
being
by
this
time
pretty
well
beside
herself
,
dispatched
the
same
messenger
in
all
haste
for
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
a
learned
man
who
could
bear
a
deal
of
responsibility
,
and
a
moral
man
who
could
administer
a
world
of
comfort
to
a
troubled
mind
.
 
<EOS>
That
her
guest
had
<EOS>
need
of
some
efficient
services
under
the
latter
head
was
obvious
enough
from
the
restless
expressions
,
importing
,
however
,
rather
a
worldly
than
a
spiritual
anxiety
,
to
which
he
gave
frequent
utterance
.
   
<EOS>
From
this
last
-
mentioned
secret
errand
,
the
messenger
returned
with
no
better
news
than
from
the
first
;
Mr
Pecksniff
was
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
got
the
patient
into
bed
without
him
;
and
in
the
course
of
two
hours
,
he
gradually
became
so
far
better
that
there
were
much
longer
intervals
than
at
first
between
his
terms
of
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
he
ceased
to
suffer
at
all
;
though
his
exhaustion
was
occasionally
so
great
that
it
suggested
hardly
less
alarm
than
his
actual
endurance
had
done
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
one
of
his
intervals
of
repose
,
when
,
looking
round
with
great
caution
,
and
reaching
uneasily
out
of
his
nest
of
pillows
,
he
endeavoured
,
with
a
strange
air
of
secrecy
and
distrust
,
to
make
use
of
the
writing
materials
which
he
had
ordered
to
be
placed
on
a
table
beside
him
,
that
the
young
lady
and
the
mistress
of
the
Blue
Dragon
found
themselves
sitting
side
by
side
before
the
fire
in
the
sick
chamber
.
   
<EOS>
The
mistress
of
the
Blue
Dragon
was
in
outward
appearance
<EOS>
just
what
a
landlady
should
be
:
broad
,
buxom
,
comfortable
,
and
good
looking
,
with
a
face
of
clear
red
and
white
,
which
,
by
its
jovial
aspect
,
at
once
bore
testimony
to
her
hearty
participation
in
the
good
things
of
the
larder
and
cellar
,
and
to
their
thriving
and
healthful
influences
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
widow
,
but
years
ago
had
passed
through
her
state
of
weeds
,
and
burst
into
flower
again
;
and
in
full
bloom
she
had
continued
ever
since
;
and
in
full
bloom
she
was
now
;
with
roses
on
her
ample
skirts
,
and
roses
on
her
bodice
,
roses
in
her
cap
,
roses
in
her
cheeks
,
---
aye
,
and
roses
,
worth
the
gathering
too
,
on
her
lips
,
for
that
matter
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
still
a
bright
black
eye
,
and
jet
black
hair
;
was
comely
,
dimpled
,
plump
,
and
tight
as
a
gooseberry
;
and
though
she
was
not
exactly
what
the
world
calls
young
,
you
may
make
an
affidavit
,
on
trust
,
before
any
mayor
or
magistrate
in
Christendom
,
that
there
are
a
great
many
young
ladies
in
the
world
(
blessings
on
them
one
and
all
!
)
<EOS>
whom
you
would
n't
like
half
as
well
,
or
admire
half
as
much
,
as
the
beaming
hostess
of
the
Blue
Dragon
.
   
<EOS>
As
this
fair
matron
sat
beside
the
fire
,
she
glanced
occasionally
with
all
the
pride
of
ownership
,
about
the
room
;
which
was
a
large
apartment
,
such
as
one
may
see
in
country
places
,
with
a
low
roof
and
a
sunken
flooring
,
all
downhill
from
the
door
,
and
a
descent
of
two
steps
on
the
inside
so
exquisitely
unexpected
,
that
strangers
,
despite
the
most
elaborate
cautioning
,
usually
dived
in
head
first
,
as
into
a
plunging
-
bath
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
none
of
your
frivolous
and
preposterously
bright
bedrooms
,
where
nobody
can
close
an
eye
with
any
kind
of
propriety
or
decent
regard
to
the
association
of
ideas
;
but
it
was
a
good
,
dull
,
leaden
,
drowsy
place
,
where
every
article
of
furniture
reminded
you
that
you
came
there
to
sleep
,
and
that
you
were
expected
to
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
wakeful
reflection
of
the
fire
there
,
as
in
your
modern
chambers
,
which
upon
the
darkest
nights
have
a
watchful
consciousness
of
French
polish
;
the
old
Spanish
mahogany
winked
at
it
now
and
then
,
as
a
dozing
cat
or
dog
might
,
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
size
and
shape
,
and
hopeless
immovability
of
the
bedstead
,
and
wardrobe
,
and
in
a
minor
degree
of
even
the
chairs
and
tables
,
provoked
sleep
;
they
were
plainly
apoplectic
and
disposed
to
snore
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
no
staring
portraits
to
remonstrate
with
you
for
being
lazy
;
no
round
-
eyed
birds
upon
the
curtains
,
disgustingly
wide
awake
,
and
insufferably
prying
.
 
<EOS>
The
thick
neutral
hangings
,
and
the
dark
blinds
,
and
the
heavy
heap
of
bed
-
clothes
,
were
all
designed
to
hold
in
sleep
,
and
act
as
nonconductors
to
the
day
and
getting
up
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
old
stuffed
fox
upon
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
was
devoid
of
any
spark
of
vigilance
,
for
his
glass
eye
had
fallen
out
,
and
he
slumbered
as
he
stood
.
   
<EOS>
The
wandering
attention
of
the
mistress
of
the
Blue
Dragon
roved
to
these
things
but
twice
or
thrice
,
and
then
for
but
an
instant
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
deserted
them
,
and
even
the
distant
bed
with
its
strange
burden
,
for
the
young
creature
immediately
before
her
,
who
,
with
her
downcast
eyes
intently
fixed
upon
the
fire
,
sat
wrapped
in
silent
meditation
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
very
young
;
apparently
no
more
than
seventeen
;
timid
and
shrinking
in
her
manner
,
and
yet
with
a
greater
share
of
self
possession
and
control
over
her
emotions
than
usually
belongs
to
a
far
more
advanced
period
of
female
life
.
 
<EOS>
This
she
had
abundantly
shown
,
but
now
,
in
her
tending
of
the
sick
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
short
in
stature
;
and
her
figure
was
slight
,
as
became
her
years
;
but
all
the
charms
of
youth
and
maidenhood
set
it
off
,
and
clustered
on
her
gentle
brow
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
very
pale
,
in
part
no
doubt
from
recent
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
Her
dark
brown
hair
,
disordered
from
the
same
cause
,
had
fallen
negligently
from
its
bonds
,
and
hung
upon
her
neck
;
for
which
instance
of
its
waywardness
no
male
observer
would
have
had
the
heart
to
blame
it
.
   
<EOS>
Her
attire
was
that
of
a
lady
,
but
extremely
plain
;
and
in
her
manner
,
even
when
she
sat
as
still
as
she
did
then
,
there
was
an
indefinable
something
which
appeared
to
be
in
kindred
with
her
scrupulously
unpretending
dress
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
sat
,
at
first
looking
anxiously
towards
the
bed
;
but
seeing
that
the
patient
remained
quiet
,
and
was
busy
with
his
writing
,
she
had
softly
moved
her
chair
into
its
present
place
;
partly
,
as
it
seemed
,
from
an
instinctive
consciousness
that
he
desired
to
avoid
observation
;
and
partly
that
she
might
,
unseen
by
him
,
give
some
vent
to
the
natural
feelings
she
had
hitherto
suppressed
.
   
<EOS>
Of
all
this
,
and
much
more
,
the
rosy
landlady
of
the
Blue
Dragon
took
as
accurate
note
and
observation
as
only
woman
can
take
of
woman
.
 
<EOS>
And
at
length
she
said
,
in
a
voice
too
low
,
she
knew
,
to
reach
the
bed
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
the
gentleman
in
this
way
before
,
miss
?
 
<EOS>
Is
he
used
to
these
attacks
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
him
very
ill
before
,
but
not
so
ill
as
he
has
been
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
Providence
!
"
said
the
landlady
of
the
Dragon
,
"
that
you
had
the
prescriptions
and
the
medicines
with
you
,
miss
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
intended
for
such
an
emergency
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
travel
without
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
thought
the
hostess
,
"
then
we
are
in
the
habit
of
travelling
,
and
of
travelling
together
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
so
conscious
of
expressing
this
in
her
face
,
that
meeting
the
young
lady
's
eyes
immediately
afterwards
,
and
being
a
very
honest
hostess
,
she
was
rather
confused
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
---
your
grandpapa
"
---
she
resumed
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
being
so
bent
on
having
no
assistance
,
must
terrify
you
very
much
,
miss
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
very
much
alarmed
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
---
he
is
not
my
grandfather
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
I
should
have
said
,
"
returned
the
hostess
,
sensible
of
having
made
an
awkward
mistake
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
my
father
"
said
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
,
"
she
added
,
slightly
smiling
with
a
quick
perception
of
what
the
landlady
was
going
to
add
,
"
Nor
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
related
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
!
"
returned
the
landlady
,
still
more
embarrassed
than
before
;
"
how
could
I
be
so
very
much
mistaken
;
knowing
,
as
anybody
in
their
proper
senses
might
that
when
a
gentleman
is
ill
,
he
looks
so
much
older
than
he
really
is
?
 
<EOS>
That
I
should
have
called
you
"
Miss
,
"
too
,
ma'am
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
had
proceeded
thus
far
,
she
glanced
involuntarily
at
the
third
finger
of
the
young
lady
's
left
hand
,
and
faltered
again
;
for
there
was
no
ring
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
told
you
we
were
not
related
,
"
said
the
other
mildly
,
but
not
without
confusion
on
her
own
part
,
"
I
meant
not
in
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
Not
even
by
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
call
me
,
Martin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Call
you
?
"
cried
the
old
man
,
looking
quickly
up
,
and
hurriedly
drawing
beneath
the
coverlet
the
paper
on
which
he
had
been
writing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
moved
a
pace
or
two
towards
the
bed
,
but
stopped
immediately
,
and
went
no
farther
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
repeated
,
with
a
petulant
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
me
?
<EOS>
If
I
had
called
you
,
what
need
for
such
a
question
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
creaking
of
the
sign
outside
,
sir
,
I
dare
say
,
"
observed
the
landlady
;
a
suggestion
by
the
way
(
as
she
felt
a
moment
after
she
had
made
it
)
,
not
at
all
complimentary
to
the
voice
of
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
matter
what
,
ma'am
,
"
he
rejoined
:
"
it
was
n't
I.
 
<EOS>
Why
how
you
stand
there
,
Mary
,
as
if
I
had
the
plague
!
 
<EOS>
But
they
're
all
afraid
of
me
,
"
he
added
,
leaning
helplessly
backward
on
his
pillow
;
"
even
she
!
<EOS>
There
is
a
curse
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
else
have
I
to
look
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
the
good
-
tempered
landlady
,
rising
,
and
going
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
of
better
cheer
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
only
sick
fancies
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
only
sick
fancies
?
<EOS>
"
he
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
know
about
fancies
?
 
<EOS>
Who
told
you
about
fancies
?
 
<EOS>
The
old
story
!
 
<EOS>
Fancies
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
see
again
there
,
how
you
take
one
up
!
"
said
the
mistress
of
the
Blue
Dragon
,
with
unimpaired
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
heart
alive
,
there
is
no
harm
in
the
word
,
sir
,
if
it
is
an
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
Folks
in
good
health
have
their
fancies
,
too
,
and
strange
ones
,
every
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Harmless
as
this
speech
appeared
to
be
,
it
acted
on
the
traveller
's
distrust
,
like
oil
on
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
his
head
up
in
the
bed
,
and
,
fixing
on
her
two
dark
eyes
whose
brightness
was
exaggerated
by
the
paleness
of
his
hollow
cheeks
,
as
they
in
turn
,
together
with
his
straggling
locks
of
long
grey
hair
,
were
rendered
whiter
by
the
tight
black
velvet
skullcap
which
he
wore
,
he
searched
her
face
intently
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
begin
too
soon
,
"
he
said
,
in
so
low
a
voice
that
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
it
,
rather
than
addressing
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
lose
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
your
errand
,
and
you
earn
your
fee
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
who
may
be
your
client
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlady
looked
in
great
astonishment
at
her
whom
he
called
Mary
,
and
finding
no
rejoinder
in
the
drooping
face
,
looked
back
again
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
she
had
recoiled
involuntarily
,
supposing
him
disordered
in
his
mind
;
but
the
slow
composure
of
his
manner
,
and
the
settled
purpose
announced
in
his
strong
features
,
and
gathering
,
most
of
all
,
about
his
puckered
mouth
,
forbade
the
supposition
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
he
said
,
"
tell
me
who
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Being
here
,
it
is
not
very
hard
for
me
to
guess
,
you
may
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Martin
,
"
interposed
the
young
lady
,
laying
her
hand
upon
his
arm
;
"
reflect
how
short
a
time
we
have
been
in
this
house
,
and
that
even
your
name
is
unknown
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unless
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
---
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
tempted
to
express
a
suspicion
of
her
having
broken
his
confidence
in
favour
of
the
landlady
,
but
either
remembering
her
tender
nursing
,
or
being
moved
in
some
sort
by
her
face
,
he
checked
himself
,
and
changing
his
uneasy
posture
in
the
bed
,
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mrs
Lupin
;
for
in
that
name
the
Blue
Dragon
was
licensed
to
furnish
entertainment
,
both
to
man
and
beast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
will
be
well
again
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
forgot
,
for
the
moment
,
that
there
were
none
but
friends
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
the
old
man
,
moaning
impatiently
,
as
he
tossed
one
restless
arm
upon
the
coverlet
;
"
why
do
you
talk
to
me
of
friends
!
<EOS>
Can
you
or
anybody
teach
me
to
know
who
are
my
friends
,
and
who
my
enemies
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
"
urged
Mrs
Lupin
,
gently
,
"
<EOS>
this
young
lady
is
your
friend
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
no
temptation
to
be
otherwise
,
"
cried
the
old
man
,
like
one
whose
hope
and
confidence
were
utterly
exhausted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
let
me
try
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
the
candle
where
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
they
retired
from
the
bed
,
he
drew
forth
the
writing
which
had
occupied
him
so
long
,
and
holding
it
in
the
flame
of
the
taper
burnt
it
to
ashes
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
extinguished
the
light
,
and
turning
his
face
away
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
drew
the
coverlet
about
his
head
,
and
lay
quite
still
.
   
<EOS>
This
destruction
of
the
paper
,
both
as
being
strangely
inconsistent
with
the
labour
he
had
devoted
to
it
,
and
as
involving
considerable
danger
of
fire
to
the
Dragon
,
occasioned
Mrs
Lupin
not
a
little
consternation
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
young
lady
evincing
no
surprise
,
curiosity
,
or
alarm
,
<EOS>
whispered
her
,
with
many
thanks
for
her
solicitude
and
company
,
that
she
would
remain
there
some
time
longer
;
and
that
she
begged
her
not
to
share
her
watch
,
as
she
was
well
used
to
being
alone
,
and
would
pass
the
time
in
reading
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
had
her
full
share
and
dividend
of
that
large
capital
of
curiosity
which
is
inherited
by
her
sex
,
and
at
another
time
it
might
have
been
difficult
so
to
impress
this
hint
upon
her
as
to
induce
her
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
in
sheer
wonder
and
amazement
at
these
mysteries
,
she
withdrew
at
once
,
and
repairing
straightway
to
her
own
little
parlour
below
stairs
,
sat
down
in
her
easy
-
chair
with
unnatural
composure
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
very
crisis
,
a
step
was
heard
in
the
entry
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
sweetly
over
the
half
-
door
of
the
bar
,
and
into
the
vista
of
snug
privacy
beyond
,
murmured
:
   
"
<EOS>
Good
evening
,
Mrs
Lupin
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
me
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
advancing
to
receive
him
,
"
I
am
so
very
glad
you
have
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
very
glad
I
have
come
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
if
I
can
be
of
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
I
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
,
Mrs
Lupin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
taken
ill
upon
the
road
,
has
been
so
very
bad
upstairs
,
sir
,
"
said
the
tearful
hostess
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
gentleman
taken
ill
upon
the
road
,
has
been
so
very
bad
upstairs
,
has
he
?
"
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
Now
there
was
nothing
that
one
may
call
decidedly
original
in
this
remark
,
nor
can
it
be
exactly
said
to
have
contained
any
wise
precept
theretofore
unknown
to
mankind
,
or
to
have
opened
any
hidden
source
of
consolation
;
but
Mr
Pecksniff
's
manner
was
so
bland
,
and
he
nodded
his
head
so
soothingly
,
and
showed
in
everything
such
an
affable
sense
of
his
own
excellence
,
that
anybody
would
have
been
,
as
Mrs
Lupin
was
,
comforted
by
the
mere
voice
and
presence
of
such
a
man
;
and
,
though
he
had
merely
said
"
a
verb
must
agree
with
its
nominative
case
in
number
and
person
,
my
good
friend
,
"
or
"
eight
times
eight
are
sixty
-
four
,
my
worthy
soul
,
"
must
have
felt
deeply
grateful
to
him
for
his
humanity
and
wisdom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
,
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
,
drawing
off
his
gloves
and
warming
his
hands
before
the
fire
,
as
benevolently
as
if
they
were
somebody
else
's
,
not
his
;
"
and
how
is
he
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
better
,
and
quite
tranquil
,
"
answered
Mrs
Lupin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
better
,
and
quite
tranquil
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
!
<EOS>
Ve
-
ry
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
Here
again
,
though
the
statement
was
Mrs
Lupin
's
and
not
Mr
Pecksniff
's
,
Mr
Pecksniff
made
it
his
own
and
consoled
her
with
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
much
when
Mrs
Lupin
said
it
,
but
it
was
a
whole
book
when
Mr
Pecksniff
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
observe
,
"
he
seemed
to
say
,
"
and
through
me
,
morality
in
general
remarks
,
that
he
is
better
and
quite
tranquil
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
must
be
weighty
matters
on
his
mind
,
though
,
"
said
the
hostess
,
shaking
her
head
,
"
for
he
talks
,
sir
,
in
the
strangest
way
you
ever
heard
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
far
from
easy
in
his
thoughts
,
and
wants
some
proper
advice
from
those
whose
goodness
makes
it
worth
his
having
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
he
is
the
sort
of
customer
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
though
he
said
this
in
the
plainest
language
,
he
did
n't
speak
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
shook
his
head
;
disparagingly
of
himself
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
sir
,
"
continued
the
landlady
,
first
looking
round
to
assure
herself
that
there
was
nobody
within
hearing
,
and
then
looking
down
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
afraid
,
sir
,
that
his
conscience
is
troubled
by
his
not
being
related
to
---
or
---
or
even
married
to
---
a
very
young
lady
---
"
   
"
Mrs
Lupin
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
holding
up
his
hand
with
something
in
his
manner
as
nearly
approaching
to
severity
as
any
expression
of
his
,
mild
being
that
he
was
,
could
ever
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
Person
!
<EOS>
young
person
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
young
person
,
"
said
Mrs
Lupin
,
curtseying
and
blushing
;
"
---
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
but
I
have
been
so
hurried
to
-
night
,
that
I
do
n't
know
what
I
say
---
who
is
with
him
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
with
him
now
,
"
ruminated
Mr
Pecksniff
,
warming
his
back
(
as
he
had
warmed
his
hands
)
as
if
it
were
a
widow
's
back
,
or
an
orphan
's
back
,
or
an
enemy
's
back
,
or
a
back
that
any
less
excellent
man
would
have
suffered
to
be
cold
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
,
dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
the
same
time
I
am
bound
to
say
,
and
I
do
say
with
all
my
heart
,
"
<EOS>
observed
the
hostess
,
earnestly
,
"
<EOS>
that
her
looks
and
manner
almost
disarm
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
suspicion
,
Mrs
Lupin
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
gravely
,
"
is
very
natural
.
"
   
<EOS>
Touching
which
remark
,
let
it
be
written
down
to
their
confusion
,
that
the
enemies
of
this
worthy
man
unblushingly
maintained
that
he
always
said
of
what
was
very
bad
,
that
it
was
very
natural
;
and
that
he
unconsciously
betrayed
his
own
nature
in
doing
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
suspicion
,
Mrs
Lupin
,
"
he
repeated
,
"
is
very
natural
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
correct
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
wait
upon
these
travellers
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
took
off
his
great
-
coat
,
and
having
run
his
fingers
through
his
hair
,
thrust
one
hand
gently
in
the
bosom
of
his
waist
-
coat
and
meekly
signed
to
her
to
lead
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
knock
?
"
asked
Mrs
Lupin
,
when
they
reached
the
chamber
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
enter
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
went
in
on
tiptoe
;
or
rather
the
hostess
took
that
precaution
for
Mr
Pecksniff
always
walked
softly
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
was
still
asleep
,
and
his
young
companion
still
sat
reading
by
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
pausing
at
the
door
,
and
giving
his
head
a
melancholy
roll
,
"
I
am
afraid
that
this
looks
artful
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
,
Mrs
Lupin
,
do
you
know
,
that
this
looks
very
artful
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
finished
this
whisper
,
he
advanced
before
the
hostess
;
and
at
the
same
time
the
young
lady
,
hearing
footsteps
,
rose
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
glanced
at
the
volume
she
held
,
and
whispered
Mrs
Lupin
again
;
if
possible
,
with
increased
despondency
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
is
a
good
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
fearful
of
that
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
apprehensive
that
this
is
a
very
deep
thing
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
gentleman
is
this
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
object
of
his
virtuous
doubts
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
do
n't
trouble
yourself
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
the
landlady
was
about
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
young
"
<EOS>
---
in
spite
of
himself
he
hesitated
when
"
person
"
rose
to
his
lips
,
and
substituted
another
word
:
"
this
young
stranger
,
Mrs
Lupin
,
will
excuse
me
for
replying
briefly
,
that
I
reside
in
this
village
;
it
may
be
in
an
influential
manner
,
however
,
undeserved
;
and
that
I
have
been
summoned
here
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
here
,
as
I
am
everywhere
,
I
hope
,
in
sympathy
for
the
sick
and
sorry
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
impressive
words
,
Mr
Pecksniff
passed
over
to
the
bedside
,
where
,
after
patting
the
counterpane
once
or
twice
in
a
very
solemn
manner
,
as
if
by
that
means
he
gained
a
clear
insight
into
the
patient
's
disorder
,
he
took
his
seat
in
a
large
arm
-
chair
,
and
in
an
attitude
of
some
thoughtfulness
and
much
comfort
,
waited
for
his
waking
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
objection
the
young
lady
urged
to
Mrs
Lupin
went
no
further
,
for
nothing
more
was
said
to
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
said
nothing
more
to
anybody
else
.
   
<EOS>
Full
half
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
old
man
stirred
,
but
at
length
he
turned
himself
in
bed
,
and
,
though
not
yet
awake
,
gave
tokens
that
his
sleep
was
drawing
to
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
By
little
and
little
he
removed
the
bed
-
clothes
from
about
his
head
,
and
turned
still
more
towards
the
side
where
Mr
Pecksniff
sat
.
 
<EOS>
In
course
of
time
his
eyes
opened
;
and
he
lay
for
a
few
moments
as
people
newly
roused
sometimes
will
,
gazing
indolently
at
his
visitor
,
without
any
distinct
consciousness
of
his
presence
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
remarkable
in
these
proceedings
,
except
the
influence
they
worked
on
Mr
Pecksniff
,
which
could
hardly
have
been
surpassed
by
the
most
marvellous
of
natural
phenomena
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
his
hands
became
tightly
clasped
upon
the
elbows
of
the
chair
,
his
eyes
dilated
with
surprise
,
his
mouth
opened
,
his
hair
stood
more
erect
upon
his
forehead
than
its
custom
was
,
until
,
at
length
,
when
the
old
man
rose
in
bed
,
and
stared
at
him
with
scarcely
less
emotion
than
he
showed
himself
,
the
Pecksniff
doubts
were
all
resolved
,
and
he
exclaimed
aloud
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
ARE
Martin
Chuzzlewit
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
consternation
of
surprise
was
so
genuine
,
that
the
old
man
,
with
all
the
disposition
that
he
clearly
entertained
to
believe
it
assumed
,
was
convinced
of
its
reality
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
"
he
said
,
bitterly
:
"
<EOS>
and
Martin
Chuzzlewit
wishes
you
had
been
hanged
,
before
you
had
come
here
to
disturb
him
in
his
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
dreamed
of
this
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
lying
down
again
,
and
turning
away
his
face
,
"
before
I
knew
that
he
was
near
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
cousin
---
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
His
very
first
words
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
old
man
,
shaking
his
grey
head
to
and
fro
upon
the
pillow
,
and
throwing
up
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
his
very
first
words
he
asserts
his
relationship
!
 
<EOS>
I
knew
he
would
;
they
all
do
it
!
 
<EOS>
Near
or
distant
,
blood
or
water
<EOS>
,
it
's
all
one
.
 
<EOS>
Ugh
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
calendar
of
deceit
,
and
lying
,
and
false
-
witnessing
,
the
sound
of
any
word
of
kindred
opens
before
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
not
be
hasty
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
in
a
tone
that
was
at
once
in
the
sublimest
degree
compassionate
and
dispassionate
;
for
he
had
by
this
time
recovered
from
his
surprise
,
and
was
in
full
possession
of
his
virtuous
self
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
regret
being
hasty
,
I
know
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
!
"
said
Martin
,
contemptuously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
retorted
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
;
and
do
n't
imagine
that
I
mean
to
court
or
flatter
you
;
for
nothing
is
further
from
my
intention
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
,
sir
,
need
you
entertain
the
least
misgiving
that
I
shall
repeat
that
obnoxious
word
which
has
given
you
so
much
offence
already
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
expect
or
want
from
you
?
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
in
your
possession
that
I
know
of
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
which
is
much
to
be
coveted
for
the
happiness
it
brings
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
enough
,
"
muttered
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Apart
from
that
consideration
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
watchful
of
the
effect
he
made
,
"
it
must
be
plain
to
you
<EOS>
(
I
am
sure
)
by
this
time
,
that
if
I
had
wished
to
insinuate
myself
into
your
good
opinion
,
I
should
have
been
,
of
all
things
,
careful
not
to
address
you
as
a
relative
;
knowing
your
humour
,
and
being
quite
certain
beforehand
that
I
could
not
have
a
worse
letter
of
recommendation
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
made
not
any
verbal
answer
;
but
he
as
clearly
implied
though
only
by
a
motion
of
his
legs
beneath
the
bed
-
clothes
,
that
there
was
reason
in
this
,
and
that
he
could
not
dispute
it
,
as
if
he
had
said
as
much
in
good
set
terms
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
keeping
his
hand
in
his
waistcoat
as
though
he
were
ready
,
on
the
shortest
notice
,
to
produce
his
heart
for
Martin
Chuzzlewit
's
inspection
,
"
I
came
here
to
offer
my
services
to
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
offer
of
them
to
you
,
because
I
know
you
would
distrust
me
if
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
lying
on
that
bed
,
sir
,
I
regard
you
as
a
stranger
,
and
I
have
just
that
amount
of
interest
in
you
which
I
hope
I
should
feel
in
any
stranger
,
circumstanced
as
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
that
,
I
am
quite
as
indifferent
to
you
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
as
you
are
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
said
which
,
Mr
Pecksniff
threw
himself
back
in
the
easy
-
chair
;
so
radiant
with
ingenuous
honesty
,
that
Mrs
Lupin
almost
wondered
not
to
see
a
stained
-
glass
Glory
,
such
as
the
Saint
wore
in
the
church
,
shining
about
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
A
long
pause
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
with
increased
restlessness
,
changed
his
posture
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
and
the
young
lady
gazed
in
silence
at
the
counterpane
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
toyed
abstractedly
with
his
eye
-
glass
,
and
kept
his
eyes
shut
,
that
he
might
ruminate
the
better
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
he
said
at
last
,
opening
them
suddenly
,
and
looking
towards
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
,
"
he
continued
,
slowly
rising
"
<EOS>
I
am
not
aware
that
I
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
is
better
,
and
you
are
as
good
a
nurse
as
he
can
have
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
last
note
of
interrogation
bore
reference
to
another
change
of
posture
on
the
old
man
's
part
,
which
brought
his
face
towards
Mr
Pecksniff
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
turned
away
from
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
desire
to
speak
to
me
before
I
go
,
sir
,
"
continued
that
gentleman
,
after
another
pause
,
"
you
may
command
my
leisure
;
but
I
must
stipulate
,
in
justice
to
myself
,
that
you
do
so
<EOS>
as
to
a
stranger
,
strictly
as
to
a
stranger
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
if
Mr
Pecksniff
knew
,
from
anything
Martin
Chuzzlewit
had
expressed
in
gestures
,
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
him
,
he
could
only
have
found
it
out
on
some
such
principle
as
prevails
in
melodramas
,
and
in
virtue
of
which
the
elderly
farmer
with
the
comic
son
always
knows
what
the
dumb
girl
means
when
she
takes
refuge
in
his
garden
,
and
relates
her
personal
memoirs
in
incomprehensible
pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
But
without
stopping
to
make
any
inquiry
on
this
point
,
Martin
Chuzzlewit
signed
to
his
young
companion
to
withdraw
,
which
she
immediately
did
,
along
with
the
landlady
leaving
him
and
Mr
Pecksniff
alone
together
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
time
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
;
or
rather
the
old
man
looked
at
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
again
closing
his
eyes
on
all
outward
objects
,
took
an
inward
survey
of
his
own
breast
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
amply
repaid
him
for
his
trouble
,
and
afforded
a
delicious
and
enchanting
prospect
,
was
clear
from
the
expression
of
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
wish
me
to
speak
to
you
as
to
a
total
stranger
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
replied
,
by
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
an
apparent
turning
round
of
his
eyes
in
their
sockets
before
he
opened
them
,
that
he
was
still
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
entertaining
that
desire
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
gratified
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
am
a
rich
man
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
rich
as
some
suppose
,
perhaps
,
but
yet
wealthy
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
miser
sir
,
though
even
that
charge
is
made
against
me
,
as
I
hear
,
and
currently
believed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
pleasure
in
hoarding
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
pleasure
in
the
possession
of
money
,
The
devil
that
we
call
by
that
name
can
give
me
nothing
but
unhappiness
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
no
description
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
gentleness
of
manner
to
adopt
the
common
parlance
,
and
say
that
he
looked
at
this
moment
as
if
butter
would
n't
melt
in
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
He
rather
looked
as
if
any
quantity
of
butter
might
have
been
made
out
of
him
,
by
churning
the
milk
of
human
kindness
,
as
it
spouted
upwards
from
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
same
reason
that
I
am
not
a
hoarder
of
money
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
I
am
not
lavish
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
find
their
gratification
in
storing
it
up
;
and
others
theirs
in
parting
with
it
;
but
I
have
no
gratification
connected
with
the
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Pain
and
bitterness
are
the
only
goods
it
ever
could
procure
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
spectre
walking
before
me
through
the
world
,
and
making
every
social
pleasure
hideous
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
thought
arose
in
Pecksniff
's
mind
,
which
must
have
instantly
mounted
to
his
face
,
or
Martin
Chuzzlewit
would
not
have
resumed
as
quickly
and
as
sternly
as
he
did
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
advise
me
for
my
peace
of
mind
,
to
get
rid
of
this
source
of
misery
,
and
transfer
it
to
some
one
who
could
bear
it
better
.
<EOS>
Even
you
,
perhaps
,
would
rid
me
of
a
burden
under
which
I
suffer
so
grievously
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
kind
stranger
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
whose
every
feature
darkened
as
he
spoke
,
"
good
Christian
stranger
,
that
is
a
main
part
of
my
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
In
other
hands
,
I
have
known
money
do
good
;
in
other
hands
I
have
known
it
triumphed
in
,
and
boasted
of
with
reason
,
as
the
master
-
key
to
all
the
brazen
gates
that
close
upon
the
paths
to
worldly
honour
,
fortune
,
and
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
To
what
man
or
woman
;
to
what
worthy
,
honest
,
incorruptible
creature
;
shall
I
confide
such
a
talisman
,
either
now
or
when
I
die
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
any
such
person
?
 
<EOS>
YOUR
virtues
are
of
course
inestimable
,
but
can
you
tell
me
of
any
other
living
creature
who
will
bear
the
test
of
contact
with
myself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
contact
with
yourself
,
sir
?
"
echoed
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
returned
the
old
man
,
"
the
test
of
contact
with
me
---
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
of
him
whose
misery
(
the
gratification
of
his
own
foolish
wish
)
was
,
that
he
turned
every
thing
he
touched
into
gold
.
<EOS>
The
curse
of
my
existence
,
and
the
realisation
of
my
own
mad
desire
is
that
by
the
golden
standard
which
I
bear
about
me
,
I
am
doomed
to
try
the
metal
of
all
other
men
,
and
find
it
false
and
hollow
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
shook
his
head
,
and
said
,
"
You
think
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
"
cried
the
old
man
,
"
I
think
so
!
<EOS>
and
in
your
telling
me
"
I
think
so
,
"
I
recognize
the
true
unworldly
ring
of
YOUR
metal
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
man
,
"
he
added
,
with
increasing
bitterness
,
"
that
I
have
gone
,
a
rich
man
,
among
people
of
all
grades
and
kinds
;
relatives
,
friends
,
and
strangers
;
among
people
in
whom
,
when
I
was
poor
,
I
had
confidence
,
and
justly
,
for
they
never
once
deceived
me
then
,
or
,
to
me
,
wronged
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
never
found
one
nature
,
no
,
not
one
,
in
which
,
being
wealthy
and
alone
,
I
was
not
forced
to
detect
the
latent
corruption
that
lay
hid
within
it
waiting
for
such
as
I
to
bring
it
forth

of

<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
not
at
all
knowing
what
it
might
be
best
to
say
in
the
momentary
pause
which
ensued
upon
these
remarks
,
made
an
elaborate
demonstration
of
intending
to
deliver
something
very
oracular
indeed
;
trusting
to
the
certainty
of
the
old
man
interrupting
him
,
before
he
should
utter
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
mistaken
,
for
Martin
Chuzzlewit
having
taken
breath
,
went
on
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
to
an
end
;
judge
what
profit
you
are
like
to
gain
from
any
repetition
of
this
visit
;
and
leave
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
so
corrupted
and
changed
the
nature
of
all
those
who
have
ever
attended
on
me
,
by
breeding
avaricious
plots
and
hopes
within
them
;
I
have
engendered
such
domestic
strife
and
discord
,
by
tarrying
even
with
members
of
my
own
family
;
I
have
been
such
a
lighted
torch
in
peaceful
homes
,
kindling
up
all
the
inflammable
gases
and
vapours
in
their
moral
atmosphere
,
which
,
but
for
me
,
might
have
proved
harmless
to
the
end
,
that
I
have
,
I
may
say
,
fled
from
all
who
knew
me
,
and
taking
refuge
in
secret
places
have
lived
,
of
late
,
the
life
of
one
who
is
hunted
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
girl
whom
you
just
now
saw
---
what
!
<EOS>
your
eye
lightens
when
I
talk
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
You
hate
her
already
,
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
and
dropping
his
eyelids
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
,
"
cried
the
old
man
,
looking
at
him
with
a
keenness
which
the
other
seemed
to
feel
,
although
he
did
not
raise
his
eyes
so
as
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
you
were
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
moment
you
reminded
me
of
one
Pecksniff
,
a
cousin
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
was
saying
---
the
young
girl
whom
you
just
now
saw
,
is
an
orphan
child
,
whom
,
with
one
steady
purpose
,
I
have
bred
and
educated
,
or
,
if
you
prefer
the
word
,
adopted
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
year
or
more
she
has
been
my
constant
companion
,
and
she
is
my
only
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
,
as
she
knows
,
a
solemn
oath
never
to
leave
her
sixpence
when
I
die
,
but
while
I
live
I
make
her
an
annual
allowance
;
not
extravagant
in
its
amount
and
yet
not
stinted
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
compact
between
us
that
no
term
of
affectionate
cajolery
shall
ever
be
addressed
by
either
to
the
other
,
but
that
she
shall
call
me
always
by
my
Christian
name
;
<EOS>
I
her
,
by
hers
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
bound
to
me
in
life
by
ties
of
interest
,
and
losing
by
my
death
,
and
having
no
expectation
disappointed
,
will
mourn
it
,
perhaps
;
though
for
that
I
care
little
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
only
kind
of
friend
I
have
or
will
have
.
 
<EOS>
Judge
from
such
premises
what
a
profitable
hour
you
have
spent
in
coming
here
,
and
leave
me
,
to
return
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
old
man
fell
slowly
back
upon
his
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
as
slowly
rose
,
and
,
with
a
prefatory
hem
,
began
as
follows
:
   
"
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
.
 
<EOS>
Go
!
"
interposed
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
weary
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
that
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
because
I
have
a
duty
to
discharge
,
from
which
,
depend
upon
it
,
I
shall
not
shrink
.
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
I
shall
not
shrink
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
lamentable
fact
,
that
as
Mr
Pecksniff
stood
erect
beside
the
bed
,
in
all
the
dignity
of
Goodness
,
and
addressed
him
thus
,
the
old
man
cast
an
angry
glance
towards
the
candlestick
,
as
if
he
were
possessed
by
a
strong
inclination
to
launch
it
at
his
cousin
's
head
.
<EOS>
But
he
constrained
himself
,
and
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
door
,
informed
him
that
his
road
lay
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
;
"
I
am
aware
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
.
<EOS>
But
before
I
go
,
I
crave
your
leave
to
speak
,
and
more
than
that
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
I
must
and
will
---
yes
indeed
,
I
repeat
it
,
must
and
will
 
---
be
heard
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
surprised
,
sir
,
at
anything
you
have
told
me
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
natural
,
very
natural
,
and
the
greater
part
of
it
was
known
to
me
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
,
"
continued
Mr
Pecksniff
,
drawing
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
winking
with
both
eyes
at
once
,
as
it
were
,
against
his
will
,
"
I
will
not
say
that
you
are
mistaken
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
While
you
are
in
your
present
mood
I
would
not
say
so
for
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
wish
,
indeed
,
that
I
had
a
different
nature
,
that
I
might
repress
even
this
slight
confession
of
weakness
;
which
I
can
not
disguise
from
you
;
which
I
feel
is
humiliating
;
but
which
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
say
,
if
you
please
,
"
added
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
great
tenderness
of
manner
,
"
that
it
arises
from
a
cold
in
the
head
,
or
is
attributable
to
snuff
,
or
smelling
-
salts
,
or
onions
,
or
anything
but
the
real
cause
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
he
paused
for
an
instant
,
and
concealed
his
face
behind
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
smiling
faintly
,
and
holding
the
bed
furniture
with
one
hand
,
he
resumed
:
   
"
<EOS>
But
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
while
I
am
forgetful
of
myself
,
I
owe
it
to
myself
,
and
to
my
character
---
aye
,
sir
,
and
I
HAVE
a
character
which
is
very
dear
to
me
,
and
will
be
the
best
inheritance
of
my
two
daughters
---
to
tell
you
,
on
behalf
of
another
,
that
your
conduct
is
wrong
,
unnatural
,
indefensible
,
monstrous
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
tell
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
towering
on
tiptoe
among
the
curtains
,
as
if
he
were
literally
rising
above
all
worldly
considerations
,
and
were
fain
to
hold
on
tight
,
to
keep
himself
from
darting
skyward
like
a
rocket
,
"
I
tell
you
without
fear
or
favour
,
that
it
will
not
do
for
you
to
be
unmindful
of
your
grandson
,
young
Martin
,
who
has
the
strongest
natural
claim
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
,
sir
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
think
it
will
do
,
but
it
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
provide
for
that
young
man
;
you
shall
provide
for
him
;
you
WILL
provide
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
glancing
at
the
pen
-
and
-
ink
,
"
that
in
secret
you
have
already
done
so
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
for
doing
so
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
for
doing
right
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
for
hating
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
So
saying
,
Mr
Pecksniff
waved
his
right
hand
with
much
solemnity
,
and
once
more
inserting
it
in
his
waistcoat
,
departed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
emotion
in
his
manner
,
but
his
step
was
firm
.
 
<EOS>
Subject
to
human
weaknesses
,
he
was
upheld
by
conscience
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
lay
for
some
time
,
with
an
expression
on
his
face
of
silent
wonder
,
not
unmixed
with
rage
;
at
length
he
muttered
in
a
whisper
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Can
the
false
-
hearted
boy
have
chosen
such
a
tool
as
yonder
fellow
who
has
just
gone
out
?
 
<EOS>
Why
not
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
conspired
against
me
,
like
the
rest
,
and
they
are
but
birds
of
one
feather
.
 
<EOS>
A
new
plot
;
a
new
plot
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
self
,
self
,
self
!
 
<EOS>
At
every
turn
nothing
but
self
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
fell
to
trifling
,
as
he
ceased
to
speak
,
with
the
ashes
of
the
burnt
paper
in
the
candlestick
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
at
first
,
in
pure
abstraction
,
but
they
presently
became
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
"
Another
will
made
and
destroyed
,
"
he
said
,
"
nothing
determined
on
,
nothing
done
,
and
I
might
have
died
to
-
night
!
 
<EOS>
I
plainly
see
to
what
foul
uses
all
this
money
will
be
put
at
last
,
"
he
cried
,
almost
writhing
in
the
bed
;
"
after
filling
me
with
cares
and
miseries
all
my
life
,
it
will
perpetuate
discord
and
bad
passions
when
I
am
dead
.
<EOS>
So
it
always
is
.
 
<EOS>
What
lawsuits
grow
out
of
the
graves
of
rich
men
,
every
day
;
sowing
perjury
,
hatred
,
and
lies
among
near
kindred
,
where
there
should
be
nothing
but
love
!
 
<EOS>
Heaven
help
us
,
we
have
much
to
answer
for
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
self
,
self
,
self
!
 
<EOS>
Every
man
for
himself
,
and
no
creature
for
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Universal
self
!
 
<EOS>
Was
there
nothing
of
its
shadow
in
these
reflections
,
and
in
the
history
of
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
on
his
own
showing
?
    
Chapter
04
.
<EOS>
From
which
it
will
appear
that
if
union
be
strength
,
and
family
affection
be
pleasant
to
contemplate
,
the
Chuzzlewits
were
the
strongest
and
most
agreeable
family
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
That
worthy
man
Mr
Pecksniff
having
taken
leave
of
his
cousin
in
the
solemn
terms
recited
in
the
last
chapter
,
withdrew
to
his
own
home
,
and
remained
there
three
whole
days
;
not
so
much
as
going
out
for
a
walk
beyond
the
boundaries
of
his
own
garden
,
lest
he
should
be
hastily
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
his
penitent
and
remorseful
relative
,
whom
,
in
his
ample
benevolence
,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
forgive
unconditionally
,
and
to
love
on
any
terms
.
 
<EOS>
But
such
was
the
obstinacy
and
such
the
bitter
nature
of
that
stern
old
man
,
that
no
repentant
summons
came
;
and
the
fourth
day
found
Mr
Pecksniff
apparently
much
farther
from
his
Christian
object
than
the
first
.
   
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
this
interval
,
he
haunted
the
Dragon
at
all
times
and
seasons
in
the
day
and
night
,
and
,
returning
good
for
evil
evinced
the
deepest
solicitude
in
the
progress
of
the
obdurate
invalid
,
in
so
much
that
Mrs
Lupin
was
fairly
melted
by
his
disinterested
anxiety
(
for
he
often
particularly
required
her
to
take
notice
that
he
would
do
the
same
by
any
stranger
or
pauper
in
the
like
condition
)
,
and
shed
many
tears
of
admiration
and
delight
.
   
<EOS>
Meantime
,
old
Martin
Chuzzlewit
remained
shut
up
in
his
own
chamber
,
and
saw
no
person
but
his
young
companion
,
saving
the
hostess
of
the
Blue
Dragon
,
who
was
,
at
certain
times
,
admitted
to
his
presence
.
<EOS>
So
surely
as
she
came
into
the
room
,
however
,
Martin
feigned
to
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
he
and
the
young
lady
were
alone
,
that
he
would
utter
a
word
,
even
in
answer
to
the
simplest
inquiry
;
though
Mr
Pecksniff
could
make
out
,
by
hard
listening
at
the
door
,
that
they
two
being
left
together
,
he
was
talkative
enough
.
   
<EOS>
It
happened
on
the
fourth
evening
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
walking
,
as
usual
,
into
the
bar
of
the
Dragon
and
finding
no
Mrs
Lupin
there
,
went
straight
upstairs
;
purposing
,
in
the
fervour
of
his
affectionate
zeal
,
to
apply
his
ear
once
more
to
the
keyhole
,
and
quiet
his
mind
by
assuring
himself
that
the
hard
-
hearted
patient
was
going
on
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
coming
softly
upon
the
dark
passage
into
which
a
spiral
ray
of
light
usually
darted
through
the
same
keyhole
,
was
astonished
to
find
no
such
ray
visible
;
and
it
happened
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
when
he
had
felt
his
way
to
the
chamber
-
door
,
stooping
hurriedly
down
to
ascertain
by
personal
inspection
whether
the
jealousy
of
the
old
man
had
caused
this
keyhole
to
be
stopped
on
the
inside
,
brought
his
head
into
such
violent
contact
with
another
head
that
he
could
not
help
uttering
in
an
audible
voice
the
monosyllable
"
Oh
!
"
which
was
,
as
it
were
,
sharply
unscrewed
and
jerked
out
of
him
by
very
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
then
,
and
lastly
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
found
himself
immediately
collared
by
something
which
smelt
like
several
damp
umbrellas
,
a
barrel
of
beer
,
a
cask
of
warm
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
a
small
parlour
-
full
of
stale
tobacco
smoke
,
mixed
;
and
was
straightway
led
downstairs
into
the
bar
from
which
he
had
lately
come
,
where
he
found
himself
standing
opposite
to
,
and
in
the
grasp
of
,
a
perfectly
strange
gentleman
of
still
stranger
appearance
who
,
with
his
disengaged
hand
,
rubbed
his
own
head
very
hard
,
and
looked
at
him
,
Pecksniff
,
with
an
evil
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
was
of
that
order
of
appearance
which
is
currently
termed
shabby
-
genteel
,
though
in
respect
of
his
dress
he
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
been
in
any
extremities
,
as
his
fingers
were
a
long
way
out
of
his
gloves
,
and
the
soles
of
his
feet
were
at
an
inconvenient
distance
from
the
upper
leather
of
his
boots
.
 
<EOS>
His
nether
garments
were
of
a
bluish
grey
---
violent
in
its
colours
once
,
but
sobered
now
by
age
and
dinginess
---
and
were
so
stretched
and
strained
in
a
tough
conflict
between
his
braces
and
his
straps
,
that
they
appeared
every
moment
in
danger
of
flying
asunder
at
the
knees
.
<EOS>
His
coat
,
in
colour
blue
and
of
a
military
cut
,
was
buttoned
and
frogged
up
to
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
His
cravat
was
,
in
hue
and
pattern
,
like
one
of
those
mantles
which
hairdressers
are
accustomed
to
wrap
about
their
clients
,
during
the
progress
of
the
professional
mysteries
.
<EOS>
His
hat
had
arrived
at
such
a
pass
that
it
would
have
been
hard
to
determine
whether
it
was
originally
white
or
black
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
wore
a
moustache
---
a
shaggy
moustache
too
;
nothing
in
the
meek
and
merciful
way
,
but
quite
in
the
fierce
and
scornful
style
;
the
regular
Satanic
sort
of
thing
---
and
he
wore
,
besides
,
a
vast
quantity
of
unbrushed
hair
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
dirty
and
very
jaunty
;
very
bold
and
very
mean
;
very
swaggering
and
very
slinking
;
very
much
like
a
man
who
might
have
been
something
better
,
and
unspeakably
like
a
man
who
deserved
to
be
something
worse
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
eaves
-
dropping
at
that
door
,
you
vagabond
!
"
said
this
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
cast
him
off
,
as
Saint
George
might
have
repudiated
the
Dragon
in
that
animal
's
last
moments
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Where
is
Mrs
Lupin
,
I
wonder
!
<EOS>
can
the
good
woman
possibly
be
aware
that
there
is
a
person
here
who
---
"
   
"
Stay
!
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
She
DOES
know
.
 
<EOS>
What
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
then
,
sir
?
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
then
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
sir
,
that
I
am
the
friend
and
relative
of
that
sick
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
That
I
am
his
protector
,
his
guardian
,
his
---
"
   
"
Not
his
niece
's
husband
,
"
interposed
the
stranger
,
"
I
'll
be
sworn
;
for
he
was
there
before
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
indignant
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
tell
me
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
bit
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
other
,
"
Perhaps
you
are
a
cousin
---
the
cousin
who
lives
in
this
place
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
AM
the
cousin
who
lives
in
this
place
,
"
replied
the
man
of
worth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
name
is
Pecksniff
?
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
proud
to
know
you
,
and
I
ask
your
pardon
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
touching
his
hat
,
and
subsequently
diving
behind
his
cravat
for
a
shirt
-
collar
,
which
however
he
did
not
succeed
in
bringing
to
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
behold
in
me
,
sir
,
one
who
has
also
an
interest
in
that
gentleman
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
a
bit
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
he
touched
the
tip
of
his
high
nose
,
by
way
of
intimation
that
he
would
let
Mr
Pecksniff
into
a
secret
presently
;
and
pulling
off
his
hat
,
began
to
search
inside
the
crown
among
a
mass
of
crumpled
documents
and
small
pieces
of
what
may
be
called
the
bark
of
broken
cigars
;
whence
he
presently
selected
the
cover
of
an
old
letter
,
begrimed
with
dirt
and
redolent
of
tobacco
.
   
<EOS>
"
Read
that
,
"
he
cried
,
giving
it
to
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
addressed
to
Chevy
Slyme
,
Esquire
,
"
said
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
Chevy
Slyme
,
Esquire
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
returned
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
he
would
say
"
I
know
there
is
such
a
person
,
and
I
am
sorry
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
remarked
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
interest
and
business
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
made
another
dive
for
his
shirt
-
collar
and
brought
up
a
string
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
this
is
very
distressing
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shaking
his
head
and
smiling
composedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
distressing
to
me
,
to
be
compelled
to
say
that
you
are
not
the
person
you
claim
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
Mr
Slyme
,
my
friend
;
this
will
not
do
;
honesty
is
the
best
policy
you
had
better
not
;
you
had
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
"
cried
the
gentleman
,
stretching
forth
his
right
arm
,
which
was
so
tightly
wedged
into
his
threadbare
sleeve
that
it
looked
like
a
cloth
sausage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
bit
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
paused
to
establish
himself
immediately
in
front
of
the
fire
with
his
back
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
gathering
the
skirts
of
his
coat
under
his
left
arm
,
and
smoothing
his
moustache
with
his
right
thumb
and
forefinger
,
he
resumed
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
your
mistake
,
and
I
am
not
offended
.
 
<EOS>
Why
?
 
<EOS>
Because
it
's
complimentary
.
 
<EOS>
You
suppose
I
would
set
myself
up
for
Chevy
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
if
there
is
a
man
on
earth
whom
a
gentleman
would
feel
proud
and
honoured
to
be
mistaken
for
,
that
man
is
my
friend
Slyme
.
<EOS>
For
he
is
,
without
an
exception
,
the
highest
-
minded
,
the
most
independent
-
spirited
,
most
original
,
spiritual
,
classical
,
talented
,
the
most
thoroughly
Shakspearian
,
if
not
Miltonic
,
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
disgustingly
-
unappreciated
dog
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
I
have
not
the
vanity
to
attempt
to
pass
for
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
Any
other
man
in
the
wide
world
,
I
am
equal
to
;
but
Slyme
is
,
I
frankly
confess
,
a
great
many
cuts
above
me
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
you
are
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
judged
from
this
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
holding
out
the
cover
of
the
letter
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
you
did
,
"
returned
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
the
whole
thing
resolves
itself
into
an
instance
of
the
peculiarities
of
genius
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
of
true
genius
has
his
peculiarity
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
the
peculiarity
of
my
friend
Slyme
is
,
that
he
is
always
waiting
round
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
perpetually
round
the
corner
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
round
the
corner
at
this
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
shaking
his
forefinger
before
his
nose
,
and
planting
his
legs
wider
apart
as
he
looked
attentively
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
face
,
"
that
is
a
remarkably
curious
and
interesting
trait
in
Mr
Slyme
's
character
;
and
whenever
Slyme
's
life
comes
to
be
written
,
that
trait
must
be
thoroughly
worked
out
by
his
biographer
or
society
will
not
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Observe
me
,
society
will
not
be
satisfied
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Slyme
's
biographer
,
sir
,
whoever
he
may
be
,
"
resumed
the
gentleman
,
"
must
apply
to
me
;
or
,
if
I
am
gone
to
that
what's
-
his
-
name
from
which
no
thingumbob
comes
back
,
he
must
apply
to
my
executors
for
leave
to
search
among
my
papers
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
a
few
notes
in
my
poor
way
,
of
some
of
that
man
's
proceedings
---
my
adopted
brother
,
sir
,
---
which
would
amaze
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
use
of
an
expression
,
sir
,
only
on
the
fifteenth
of
last
month
when
he
could
n't
meet
a
little
bill
and
the
other
party
would
n't
renew
,
which
would
have
done
honour
to
Napoleon
Bonaparte
in
addressing
the
French
army
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
pray
,
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
,
obviously
not
quite
at
his
ease
,
"
what
may
be
Mr
Slyme
's
business
here
,
if
I
may
be
permitted
to
inquire
,
who
am
compelled
by
a
regard
for
my
own
character
to
disavow
all
interest
in
his
proceedings
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
"
returned
the
gentleman
,
"
you
will
permit
me
to
say
,
that
I
object
to
that
remark
,
and
that
I
strongly
and
indignantly
protest
against
it
on
behalf
of
my
friend
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
next
place
,
you
will
give
me
leave
to
introduce
myself
.
 
<EOS>
My
name
,
sir
,
is
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
Montague
Tigg
will
perhaps
be
familiar
to
you
,
in
connection
with
the
most
remarkable
events
of
the
Peninsular
War
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
gently
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
matter
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
man
was
my
father
,
and
I
bear
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
consequently
proud
---
proud
as
Lucifer
.
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
one
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
my
friend
Slyme
to
be
present
at
the
remainder
of
this
conference
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
announcement
he
hurried
away
to
the
outer
door
of
the
Blue
Dragon
,
and
almost
immediately
returned
with
a
companion
shorter
than
himself
,
who
was
wrapped
in
an
old
blue
camlet
cloak
with
a
lining
of
faded
scarlet
.
 
<EOS>
His
sharp
features
being
much
pinched
and
nipped
by
long
waiting
in
the
cold
,
and
his
straggling
red
whiskers
and
frowzy
hair
being
more
than
usually
dishevelled
from
the
same
cause
<EOS>
,
he
certainly
looked
rather
unwholesome
and
uncomfortable
than
Shakspearian
or
Miltonic
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
clapping
one
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
his
prepossessing
friend
,
and
calling
Mr
Pecksniff
's
attention
to
him
with
the
other
,
"
you
two
are
related
;
and
relations
never
did
agree
,
and
never
will
;
which
is
a
wise
dispensation
and
an
inevitable
thing
,
or
there
would
be
none
but
family
parties
,
and
everybody
in
the
world
would
bore
everybody
else
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
were
on
good
terms
,
I
should
consider
you
a
most
confoundedly
unnatural
pair
;
but
standing
towards
each
other
as
you
do
<EOS>
,
I
took
upon
you
as
a
couple
of
devilish
deep
-
thoughted
fellows
,
who
may
be
reasoned
with
to
any
extent
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
<EOS>
Mr
Chevy
Slyme
,
whose
great
abilities
seemed
one
and
all
to
point
towards
the
sneaking
quarter
of
the
moral
compass
,
nudged
his
friend
stealthily
with
his
elbow
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
Chiv
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
aloud
,
in
the
high
tone
of
one
who
was
not
to
be
tampered
with
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
to
that
presently
.
 
<EOS>
I
act
upon
my
own
responsibility
,
or
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
extent
of
such
a
trifling
loan
as
a
crownpiece
to
a
man
of
your
talents
,
I
look
upon
Mr
Pecksniff
as
certain
;
"
and
seeing
at
this
juncture
that
the
expression
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
face
by
no
means
betokened
that
he
shared
this
certainty
,
Mr
Tigg
laid
his
finger
on
his
nose
again
for
that
gentleman
's
private
and
especial
behoof
;
calling
upon
him
thereby
to
take
notice
that
the
requisition
of
small
loans
was
another
instance
of
the
peculiarities
of
genius
as
developed
in
his
friend
Slyme
;
that
he
,
Tigg
,
winked
at
the
same
,
because
of
the
strong
metaphysical
interest
which
these
weaknesses
possessed
;
and
that
in
reference
to
his
own
personal
advocacy
of
such
small
advances
,
he
merely
consulted
the
humour
of
his
friend
,
without
the
least
regard
to
his
own
advantage
or
necessities
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Chiv
,
Chiv
!
"
added
Mr
Tigg
,
surveying
his
adopted
brother
with
an
air
of
profound
contemplation
after
dismissing
this
piece
of
pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
upon
my
life
,
a
strange
instance
of
the
little
frailties
that
beset
a
mighty
mind
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
had
never
been
a
telescope
in
the
world
,
I
should
have
been
quite
certain
from
my
observation
of
you
,
Chiv
,
that
there
were
spots
on
the
sun
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
die
,
if
this
is
n't
the
queerest
state
of
existence
that
we
find
ourselves
forced
into
without
knowing
why
or
wherefore
,
Mr
Pecksniff
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
never
mind
!
 
<EOS>
Moralise
as
we
will
,
the
world
goes
on
.
<EOS>
As
Hamlet
says
,
Hercules
may
lay
about
him
with
his
club
in
every
possible
direction
,
but
he
ca
n't
prevent
the
cats
from
making
a
most
intolerable
row
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
,
or
the
dogs
from
being
shot
in
the
hot
weather
if
they
run
about
the
streets
unmuzzled
.
<EOS>
Life
's
a
riddle
;
a
most
infernally
hard
riddle
to
guess
,
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
opinions
,
that
like
that
celebrated
conundrum
,
"
Why
's
a
man
in
jail
like
a
man
out
of
jail
?
<EOS>
"
there
's
no
answer
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
and
body
,
it
's
the
queerest
sort
of
thing
altogether
---
but
there
's
no
use
in
talking
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
which
consolatory
deduction
from
the
gloomy
premises
recited
,
Mr
Tigg
roused
himself
by
a
great
effort
,
and
proceeded
in
his
former
strain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
most
confoundedly
soft
-
hearted
kind
of
fellow
in
my
way
,
and
I
can
not
stand
by
,
and
see
you
two
blades
cutting
each
other
's
throats
when
there
's
nothing
to
be
got
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
you
're
the
cousin
of
the
testator
upstairs
and
we
're
the
nephew
<EOS>
---
I
say
we
,
meaning
Chiv
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
in
all
essential
points
you
are
more
nearly
related
to
him
than
we
are
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
so
be
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
ca
n't
get
at
him
,
neither
can
we
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
my
brightest
word
of
honour
,
sir
,
that
I
've
been
looking
through
that
keyhole
with
short
intervals
of
rest
,
ever
since
nine
o'clock
this
morning
,
in
expectation
of
receiving
an
answer
to
one
of
the
most
moderate
and
gentlemanly
applications
for
a
little
temporary
assistance
---
only
fifteen
pounds
,
and
MY
security
 
---
that
the
mind
of
man
can
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
sir
,
he
is
perpetually
closeted
with
,
and
pouring
his
whole
confidence
into
the
bosom
of
,
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
say
decisively
with
regard
to
this
state
of
circumstances
,
that
it
wo
n't
do
;
that
it
wo
n't
act
;
that
it
ca
n't
be
;
and
that
it
must
not
be
suffered
to
continue
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Every
man
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
has
a
right
,
an
undoubted
right
,
(
which
I
,
for
one
,
would
not
call
in
question
for
any
earthly
consideration
;
<EOS>
oh
no
!
)
to
regulate
his
own
proceedings
by
his
own
likings
and
dislikings
,
supposing
they
are
not
immoral
and
not
irreligious
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
feel
in
my
own
breast
,
that
Mr
Chuzzlewit
does
not
regard
---
me
,
for
instance
;
say
me
---
with
exactly
that
amount
of
Christian
love
which
should
subsist
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
feel
grieved
and
hurt
at
the
circumstance
;
still
I
may
not
rush
to
the
conclusion
that
Mr
Chuzzlewit
is
wholly
without
a
justification
in
all
his
coldnesses
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
!
 
<EOS>
Besides
;
how
,
Mr
Tigg
,
"
continued
Pecksniff
even
more
gravely
and
impressively
than
he
had
spoken
yet
,
"
how
could
Mr
Chuzzlewit
be
prevented
from
having
these
peculiar
and
most
extraordinary
confidences
of
which
you
speak
;
the
existence
of
which
I
must
admit
;
and
which
I
can
not
but
deplore
---
for
his
sake
?
<EOS>
Consider
,
my
good
sir
---
"
and
here
Mr
Pecksniff
eyed
him
wistfully
---
 
<EOS>
"
how
very
much
at
random
you
are
talking
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
as
to
that
,
"
rejoined
Tigg
,
"
it
certainly
is
a
difficult
question
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
it
is
a
difficult
question
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
answered
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
he
drew
himself
aloft
,
and
seemed
to
grow
more
mindful
,
suddenly
,
of
the
moral
gulf
between
himself
and
the
creature
he
addressed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
it
is
a
very
difficult
question
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
far
from
feeling
sure
that
it
is
a
question
any
one
is
authorized
to
discuss
.
 
<EOS>
Good
evening
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
that
the
Spottletoes
are
here
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Mr
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
<EOS>
what
Spottletoes
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Pecksniff
,
stopping
abruptly
on
his
way
to
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
and
Mrs
Spottletoe
,
"
said
Chevy
Slyme
,
Esquire
,
speaking
aloud
for
the
first
time
,
and
speaking
very
sulkily
;
<EOS>
shambling
with
his
legs
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spottletoe
married
my
father
's
brother
's
child
,
did
n't
he
?
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Spottletoe
is
Chuzzlewit
's
own
niece
,
is
n't
she
?
<EOS>
She
was
his
favourite
once
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
well
ask
what
Spottletoes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
upon
my
sacred
word
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
upwards
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
The
rapacity
of
these
people
is
absolutely
frightful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
only
the
Spottletoes
either
,
Tigg
,
"
said
Slyme
,
looking
at
that
gentleman
and
speaking
at
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
and
his
son
have
got
wind
of
it
,
and
have
come
down
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
saw
'em
not
five
minutes
ago
,
when
I
was
waiting
round
the
corner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mammon
,
Mammon
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
smiting
his
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
there
,
"
said
Slyme
,
regardless
of
the
interruption
,
"
are
his
brother
and
another
nephew
for
you
,
already
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
whole
thing
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
;
"
this
is
the
point
and
purpose
at
which
I
was
gradually
arriving
when
my
friend
Slyme
here
,
with
six
words
,
hit
it
full
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
now
that
your
cousin
(
and
Chiv
's
uncle
)
has
turned
up
,
some
steps
must
be
taken
to
prevent
his
disappearing
again
;
and
,
if
possible
,
to
counteract
the
influence
which
is
exercised
over
him
now
,
by
this
designing
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
who
is
interested
feels
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
family
is
pouring
down
to
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
has
come
when
individual
jealousies
and
interests
must
be
forgotten
for
a
time
,
sir
,
and
union
must
be
made
against
the
common
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
common
enemy
is
routed
,
you
will
all
set
up
for
yourselves
again
;
every
lady
and
gentleman
who
has
a
part
in
the
game
,
will
go
in
on
their
own
account
and
bowl
away
,
to
the
best
of
their
ability
,
at
the
testator
's
wicket
,
and
nobody
will
be
in
a
worse
position
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
commit
yourself
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
find
us
at
the
Half
Moon
and
Seven
Stars
in
this
village
,
at
any
time
,
and
open
to
any
reasonable
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
Hem
!
<EOS>
Chiv
,
my
dear
fellow
,
go
out
and
see
what
sort
of
a
night
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Slyme
lost
no
time
in
disappearing
,
and
it
is
to
be
presumed
in
going
round
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
,
planting
his
legs
as
wide
apart
as
he
could
be
reasonably
expected
by
the
most
sanguine
man
to
keep
them
,
shook
his
head
at
Mr
Pecksniff
and
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
be
too
hard
,
"
he
said
,
"
upon
the
little
eccentricities
of
our
friend
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
You
saw
him
whisper
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
seen
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
heard
my
answer
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
heard
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Five
shillings
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
an
extraordinary
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
Very
moderate
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
made
no
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Five
shillings
!
"
pursued
Mr
Tigg
,
musing
;
"
and
to
be
punctually
repaid
next
week
;
that
's
the
best
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
heard
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
not
heard
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
You
surprise
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
cream
of
the
thing
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
that
man
fail
to
redeem
a
promise
,
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
You
're
not
in
want
of
change
,
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
returned
Mr
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
been
,
I
'd
have
got
it
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
began
to
whistle
;
but
a
dozen
seconds
had
not
elapsed
when
he
stopped
short
,
and
looking
earnestly
at
Mr
Pecksniff
,
said
:
   
"
Perhaps
you
'd
rather
not
lend
Slyme
five
shillings
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
much
rather
not
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
rejoined
.
   
<EOS>
"
Egad
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tigg
,
gravely
nodding
his
head
as
if
some
ground
of
objection
occurred
to
him
at
that
moment
for
the
first
time
,
"
it
's
very
possible
you
may
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
entertain
the
same
sort
of
objection
to
lending
me
five
shillings
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
could
n't
do
it
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
even
half
-
a
-
crown
,
perhaps
?
"
urged
Mr
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
even
half
-
a
-
crown
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
we
come
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
"
to
the
ridiculously
small
amount
of
eighteen
pence
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
would
be
equally
objectionable
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
receipt
of
this
assurance
,
Mr
Tigg
shook
him
heartily
by
both
hands
,
protesting
with
much
earnestness
,
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
consistent
and
remarkable
men
he
had
ever
met
,
and
that
he
desired
the
honour
of
his
better
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
He
moreover
observed
that
there
were
many
little
characteristics
about
his
friend
Slyme
,
of
which
he
could
by
no
means
,
as
a
man
of
strict
honour
,
approve
;
but
that
he
was
prepared
to
forgive
him
all
these
slight
drawbacks
,
and
much
more
,
in
consideration
of
the
great
pleasure
he
himself
had
that
day
enjoyed
in
his
social
intercourse
with
Mr
Pecksniff
,
which
had
given
him
a
far
higher
and
more
enduring
delight
than
the
successful
negotiation
of
any
small
loan
on
the
part
of
his
friend
could
possibly
have
imparted
.
 
<EOS>
With
which
remarks
he
would
beg
leave
,
he
said
,
to
wish
Mr
Pecksniff
a
very
good
evening
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
took
himself
off
;
as
little
abashed
by
his
recent
failure
as
any
gentleman
would
desire
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
The
meditations
of
Mr
Pecksniff
that
evening
at
the
bar
of
the
Dragon
,
and
that
night
in
his
own
house
,
were
very
serious
and
grave
indeed
;
the
more
especially
as
the
intelligence
he
had
received
from
Messrs
Tigg
and
Slyme
touching
the
arrival
of
other
members
of
the
family
,
were
fully
confirmed
on
more
particular
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
Spottletoes
had
actually
gone
straight
to
the
Dragon
,
where
they
were
at
that
moment
housed
and
mounting
guard
,
and
where
their
appearance
had
occasioned
such
a
vast
sensation
that
Mrs
Lupin
,
scenting
their
errand
before
they
had
been
under
her
roof
half
an
hour
,
carried
the
news
herself
with
all
possible
secrecy
straight
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
;
indeed
it
was
her
great
caution
in
doing
so
which
occasioned
her
to
miss
that
gentleman
,
who
entered
at
the
front
door
of
the
Dragon
just
as
she
emerged
from
the
back
one
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Mr
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
and
his
son
Jonas
were
economically
quartered
at
the
Half
Moon
and
Seven
Stars
,
which
was
an
obscure
ale
-
house
;
and
by
the
very
next
coach
there
came
posting
to
the
scene
of
action
,
so
many
other
affectionate
members
of
the
family
(
who
quarrelled
with
each
other
,
inside
and
out
,
all
the
way
down
,
to
the
utter
distraction
of
the
coachman
)
,
that
in
less
than
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
the
scanty
tavern
accommodation
was
at
a
premium
,
and
all
the
private
lodgings
in
the
place
,
amounting
to
full
four
beds
and
sofa
,
rose
cent
per
cent
in
the
market
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
things
came
to
that
pass
that
nearly
the
whole
family
sat
down
before
the
Blue
Dragon
,
and
formally
invested
it
;
and
Martin
Chuzzlewit
was
in
a
state
of
siege
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
resisted
bravely
;
refusing
to
receive
all
letters
,
messages
,
and
parcels
;
obstinately
declining
to
treat
with
anybody
;
and
holding
out
no
hope
or
promise
of
capitulation
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
the
family
forces
were
perpetually
encountering
each
other
in
divers
parts
of
the
neighbourhood
;
and
,
as
no
one
branch
of
the
Chuzzlewit
tree
had
ever
been
known
to
agree
with
another
within
the
memory
of
man
,
there
was
such
a
skirmishing
,
and
flouting
,
and
snapping
off
of
heads
,
in
the
metaphorical
sense
of
that
expression
;
such
a
bandying
of
words
and
calling
of
names
;
such
an
upturning
of
noses
and
wrinkling
of
brows
;
such
a
formal
interment
of
good
feelings
and
violent
resurrection
of
ancient
grievances
;
as
had
never
been
known
in
those
quiet
parts
since
the
earliest
record
of
their
civilized
existence
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
in
utter
despair
and
hopelessness
,
some
few
of
the
belligerents
began
to
speak
to
each
other
in
only
moderate
terms
of
mutual
aggravation
;
and
nearly
all
addressed
themselves
with
a
show
of
tolerable
decency
to
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
recognition
of
his
high
character
and
influential
position
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
by
little
and
little
,
they
made
common
cause
of
Martin
Chuzzlewit
's
obduracy
,
until
it
was
agreed
(
if
such
a
word
can
be
used
in
connection
with
the
Chuzzlewits
)
that
there
should
be
a
general
council
and
conference
held
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
upon
a
certain
day
at
noon
;
which
all
members
of
the
family
who
had
brought
themselves
within
reach
of
the
summons
,
were
forthwith
bidden
and
invited
,
solemnly
,
to
attend
.
   
<EOS>
If
ever
Mr
Pecksniff
wore
an
apostolic
look
,
he
wore
it
on
this
memorable
day
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
his
unruffled
smile
proclaimed
the
words
,
"
I
am
a
messenger
of
peace
!
"
<EOS>
that
was
its
mission
now
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
man
combined
within
himself
all
the
mild
qualities
of
the
lamb
with
a
considerable
touch
of
the
dove
,
and
not
a
dash
of
the
crocodile
,
or
the
least
possible
suggestion
of
the
very
mildest
seasoning
of
the
serpent
,
that
man
was
he
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
oh
,
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
serene
expression
on
the
face
of
Charity
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
I
know
that
all
my
family
have
injured
me
beyond
the
possibility
of
reparation
,
but
<EOS>
I
forgive
them
,
for
it
is
my
duty
so
to
do
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
oh
,
the
gay
simplicity
of
Mercy
;
so
charming
,
innocent
,
and
infant
-
like
,
that
if
she
had
gone
out
walking
by
herself
,
and
it
had
been
a
little
earlier
in
the
season
,
the
robin
-
redbreasts
might
have
covered
her
with
leaves
against
her
will
,
believing
her
to
be
one
of
the
sweet
children
in
the
wood
,
come
out
of
it
,
and
issuing
forth
once
more
to
look
for
blackberries
in
the
young
freshness
of
her
heart
!
 
<EOS>
What
words
can
paint
the
Pecksniffs
in
that
trying
hour
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
none
;
for
words
have
naughty
company
among
them
,
and
the
Pecksniffs
were
all
goodness
.
   
<EOS>
But
when
the
company
arrived
!
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Pecksniff
,
rising
from
his
seat
at
the
table
's
head
,
with
a
daughter
on
either
hand
,
received
his
guests
in
the
best
parlour
and
motioned
them
to
chairs
,
with
eyes
so
overflowing
and
countenance
so
damp
with
gracious
perspiration
,
that
he
may
be
said
to
have
been
in
a
kind
of
moist
meekness
!
 
<EOS>
And
the
company
;
the
jealous
stony
-
hearted
distrustful
company
,
who
were
all
shut
up
in
themselves
,
and
had
no
faith
in
anybody
,
and
would
n't
believe
anything
,
and
would
no
more
allow
themselves
to
be
softened
or
lulled
asleep
by
the
Pecksniffs
than
if
they
had
been
so
many
hedgehogs
or
porcupines
!
   
<EOS>
First
,
there
was
Mr
Spottletoe
,
who
was
so
bald
and
had
such
big
whiskers
,
that
he
seemed
to
have
stopped
his
hair
,
by
the
sudden
application
of
some
powerful
remedy
,
in
the
very
act
of
falling
off
his
head
,
and
to
have
fastened
it
irrevocably
on
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
was
Mrs
Spottletoe
,
who
being
much
too
slim
for
her
years
,
and
of
a
poetical
constitution
,
was
accustomed
to
inform
her
more
intimate
friends
that
the
said
whiskers
were
"
the
lodestar
of
her
existence
;
"
and
who
could
now
,
by
reason
of
her
strong
affection
for
her
uncle
Chuzzlewit
,
and
the
shock
it
gave
her
to
be
suspected
of
testamentary
designs
upon
him
,
do
nothing
but
cry
---
except
moan
.
<EOS>
Then
there
were
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
,
and
his
son
Jonas
;
the
face
of
the
old
man
so
sharpened
by
the
wariness
and
cunning
of
his
life
,
that
it
seemed
to
cut
him
a
passage
through
the
crowded
room
,
as
he
edged
away
behind
the
remotest
chairs
;
while
the
son
had
so
well
profited
by
the
precept
and
example
of
the
father
,
that
he
looked
a
year
or
two
the
elder
of
the
twain
,
as
they
stood
winking
their
red
eyes
,
side
by
side
,
and
whispering
to
each
other
softly
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
widow
of
a
deceased
brother
of
Mr
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
who
being
almost
supernaturally
disagreeable
,
and
having
a
dreary
face
and
a
bony
figure
and
a
masculine
voice
,
was
,
in
right
of
these
qualities
,
what
is
commonly
called
a
strong
-
minded
woman
;
and
who
,
if
she
could
,
would
have
established
her
claim
to
the
title
,
and
have
shown
herself
,
mentally
speaking
,
a
perfect
Samson
,
by
shutting
up
her
brother
-
in
-
law
in
a
private
madhouse
,
until
he
proved
his
complete
sanity
by
loving
her
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
her
sat
her
spinster
daughters
,
three
in
number
,
and
of
gentlemanly
deportment
,
who
had
so
mortified
themselves
with
tight
stays
,
that
their
tempers
were
reduced
to
something
less
than
their
waists
,
and
sharp
lacing
was
expressed
in
their
very
noses
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
young
gentleman
,
grandnephew
of
Mr
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
very
dark
and
very
hairy
,
and
apparently
born
for
no
particular
purpose
but
to
save
looking
-
glasses
the
trouble
of
reflecting
more
than
just
the
first
idea
and
sketchy
notion
of
a
face
,
which
had
never
been
carried
out
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
solitary
female
cousin
who
was
remarkable
for
nothing
but
being
very
deaf
,
and
living
by
herself
,
and
always
having
the
toothache
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
was
George
Chuzzlewit
,
a
gay
bachelor
cousin
,
who
claimed
to
be
young
but
had
been
younger
,
and
was
inclined
to
corpulency
,
and
rather
overfed
himself
;
to
that
extent
,
indeed
,
that
his
eyes
were
strained
in
their
sockets
,
as
if
with
constant
surprise
;
and
he
had
such
an
obvious
disposition
to
pimples
,
that
the
bright
spots
on
his
cravat
,
the
rich
pattern
on
his
waistcoat
,
and
even
his
glittering
trinkets
,
seemed
to
have
broken
out
upon
him
,
and
not
to
have
come
into
existence
comfortably
.
 
<EOS>
Last
of
all
there
were
present
Mr
Chevy
Slyme
and
his
friend
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
worthy
of
remark
,
that
although
each
person
present
disliked
the
other
,
mainly
because
he
or
she
DID
belong
to
the
family
,
they
one
and
all
concurred
in
hating
Mr
Tigg
because
he
did
n't
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
pleasant
little
family
circle
now
assembled
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
best
parlour
,
agreeably
prepared
to
fall
foul
of
Mr
Pecksniff
or
anybody
else
who
might
venture
to
say
anything
whatever
upon
any
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
rising
and
looking
round
upon
them
with
folded
hands
,
"
does
me
good
.
 
<EOS>
It
does
my
daughters
good
.
 
<EOS>
We
thank
you
for
assembling
here
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
grateful
to
you
with
our
whole
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
blessed
distinction
that
you
have
conferred
upon
us
,
and
believe
me
"
---
 
<EOS>
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
how
he
smiled
here
---
"
we
shall
not
easily
forget
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you
,
Pecksniff
,
"
remarked
Mr
Spottletoe
,
with
his
whiskers
in
a
very
portentous
state
;
"
but
you
are
assuming
too
much
to
yourself
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Who
do
you
imagine
has
it
in
contemplation
to
confer
a
distinction
upon
YOU
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
general
murmur
echoed
this
inquiry
,
and
applauded
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
about
to
pursue
the
course
with
which
you
have
begun
,
sir
,
"
pursued
Mr
Spottletoe
in
a
great
heat
,
and
giving
a
violent
rap
on
the
table
with
his
knuckles
,
"
the
sooner
you
desist
,
and
this
assembly
separates
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
no
stranger
,
sir
,
to
your
preposterous
desire
to
be
regarded
as
the
head
of
this
family
,
but
I
can
tell
YOU
,
sir
---
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
HE
tell
.
 
<EOS>
HE
!
 
<EOS>
What
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
head
,
was
he
?
 
<EOS>
From
the
strong
-
minded
woman
downwards
everybody
fell
,
that
instant
,
upon
Mr
Spottletoe
,
who
after
vainly
attempting
to
be
heard
in
silence
was
fain
to
sit
down
again
,
folding
his
arms
and
shaking
his
head
most
wrathfully
,
and
giving
Mrs
Spottletoe
to
understand
in
dumb
show
,
that
that
scoundrel
Pecksniff
might
go
on
for
the
present
,
but
he
would
cut
in
presently
,
and
annihilate
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
sorry
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
in
resumption
of
his
address
,
"
I
am
really
not
sorry
that
this
little
incident
has
happened
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
good
to
feel
that
we
are
met
here
without
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
good
to
know
that
we
have
no
reserve
before
each
other
,
but
are
appearing
freely
in
our
own
characters
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
strong
-
minded
woman
rose
a
little
way
from
her
seat
,
and
trembling
violently
from
head
to
foot
,
more
as
it
seemed
with
passion
than
timidity
,
expressed
a
general
hope
that
some
people
WOULD
appear
in
their
own
characters
,
if
it
were
only
for
such
a
proceeding
having
the
attraction
of
novelty
to
recommend
it
;
and
that
when
they
(
meaning
the
some
people
before
mentioned
)
talked
about
their
relations
,
they
would
be
careful
to
observe
who
was
present
in
company
at
the
time
;
otherwise
it
might
come
round
to
those
relations
'
ears
,
in
a
way
they
little
expected
;
and
as
to
red
noses
(
she
observed
)
<EOS>
she
had
yet
to
learn
that
a
red
nose
was
any
disgrace
,
inasmuch
as
people
neither
made
nor
coloured
their
own
noses
,
but
had
that
feature
provided
for
them
without
being
first
consulted
;
though
even
upon
that
branch
of
the
subject
she
had
great
doubts
whether
certain
noses
were
redder
than
other
noses
,
or
indeed
half
as
red
as
some
.
 
<EOS>
This
remark
being
received
with
a
shrill
titter
by
the
two
sisters
of
the
speaker
,
Miss
Charity
Pecksniff
begged
with
much
politeness
to
be
informed
whether
any
of
those
very
low
observations
were
levelled
at
her
;
and
receiving
no
more
explanatory
answer
than
was
conveyed
in
the
adage
<EOS>
"
Those
the
cap
fits
,
let
them
wear
it
,
"
immediately
commenced
a
somewhat
acrimonious
and
personal
retort
,
wherein
she
was
much
comforted
and
abetted
by
her
sister
Mercy
,
who
laughed
at
the
same
with
great
heartiness
;
indeed
far
more
naturally
than
life
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
being
quite
impossible
that
any
difference
of
opinion
can
take
place
among
women
without
every
woman
who
is
within
hearing
taking
active
part
in
it
,
the
strong
-
minded
lady
and
her
two
daughters
,
and
Mrs
Spottletoe
,
and
the
deaf
cousin
(
who
was
not
at
all
disqualified
from
joining
in
the
dispute
by
reason
of
being
perfectly
unacquainted
with
its
merits
)
,
one
and
all
plunged
into
the
quarrel
directly
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
being
a
pretty
good
match
for
the
three
Miss
Chuzzlewits
,
and
all
five
young
ladies
having
,
in
the
figurative
language
of
the
day
,
a
great
amount
of
steam
to
dispose
of
,
the
altercation
would
no
doubt
have
been
a
long
one
but
for
the
high
valour
and
prowess
of
the
strong
-
minded
woman
,
who
,
in
right
of
her
reputation
for
powers
of
sarcasm
,
did
so
belabour
and
pummel
Mrs
Spottletoe
with
taunting
words
that
the
poor
lady
,
before
the
engagement
was
two
minutes
old
,
had
no
refuge
but
in
tears
.
 
<EOS>
These
she
shed
so
plentifully
,
and
so
much
to
the
agitation
and
grief
of
Mr
Spottletoe
,
that
that
gentleman
,
after
holding
his
clenched
fist
close
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
eyes
,
as
if
it
were
some
natural
curiosity
from
the
near
inspection
whereof
he
was
likely
to
derive
high
gratification
and
improvement
,
and
after
offering
(
for
no
particular
reason
that
anybody
could
discover
)
to
kick
Mr
George
Chuzzlewit
for
,
and
in
consideration
of
,
the
trifling
sum
of
sixpence
,
took
his
wife
under
his
arm
and
indignantly
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
This
diversion
,
by
distracting
the
attention
of
the
combatants
,
put
an
end
to
the
strife
,
which
,
after
breaking
out
afresh
some
twice
or
thrice
in
certain
inconsiderable
spurts
and
dashes
,
died
away
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
Mr
Pecksniff
once
more
rose
from
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
composed
themselves
to
look
as
if
there
were
no
such
beings
---
not
to
say
present
,
but
in
the
whole
compass
of
the
world
---
as
the
three
Miss
Chuzzlewits
;
while
the
three
Miss
Chuzzlewits
became
equally
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
be
lamented
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
forgiving
recollection
of
Mr
Spottletoe
's
fist
,
"
that
our
friend
should
have
withdrawn
himself
so
very
hastily
,
though
we
have
cause
for
mutual
congratulation
even
in
that
,
since
we
are
assured
that
he
is
not
distrustful
of
us
in
regard
to
anything
we
may
say
or
do
while
he
is
absent
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
that
is
very
soothing
,
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pecksniff
,
"
said
Anthony
,
who
had
been
watching
the
whole
party
with
peculiar
keenness
from
the
first
---
"
do
n't
you
be
a
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
what
,
my
good
sir
?
"
demanded
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Charity
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
when
I
take
my
chamber
candlestick
to
-
night
,
remind
me
to
be
more
than
usually
particular
in
praying
for
Mr
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
;
who
has
done
me
an
injustice
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
said
in
a
very
bland
voice
,
and
aside
,
as
being
addressed
to
his
daughter
's
private
ear
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
cheerfulness
of
conscience
,
prompting
almost
a
sprightly
demeanour
,
he
then
resumed
:
   
<EOS>
"
All
our
thoughts
centring
in
our
very
dear
but
unkind
relative
,
and
<EOS>
he
being
as
it
were
beyond
our
reach
,
we
are
met
to
-
day
,
really
as
if
we
were
a
funeral
party
,
except
---
a
blessed
exception
---
that
there
is
no
body
in
the
house
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
strong
-
minded
lady
was
not
at
all
sure
that
this
was
a
blessed
exception
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
the
contrary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
madam
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
that
as
it
may
,
here
we
are
;
and
being
here
,
we
are
to
consider
whether
it
is
possible
by
any
justifiable
means
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
know
as
well
as
I
,
"
said
the
strong
-
minded
lady
,
"
that
any
means
are
justifiable
in
such
a
case
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
my
dear
madam
,
very
good
;
whether
it
is
possible
by
ANY
means
,
we
will
say
by
ANY
means
,
to
open
the
eyes

infatuation

Whether
it
is
possible
to
make
him
acquainted
by
any

with
the

of
that
young
female
whose

strange

here
Mr
Pecksniff
sunk
his
voice
to
an
impressive
whisper

really
casts
a
shadow
of
disgrace
and
shame
upon
this
family
;

we
know

he
raised
his

again

else
<EOS>
why
is
she
his
companion
?
<EOS>
harbours
the
very
basest
designs
upon
his
weakness
and
his
property
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
their
strong
feeling
on
this
point
,
they
,
who
agreed
in
nothing
else
,
all
concurred
as
one
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
that
she
should
harbour
designs
upon
his
property
!
 
<EOS>
The
strong
-
minded
lady
was
for
poison
,
her
three
daughters
were
for
Bridewell
and
bread
-
and
-
water
,
the
cousin
with
the
toothache
advocated
Botany
Bay
,
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
suggested
flogging
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
but
Mr
Tigg
,
who
,
notwithstanding
his
extreme
shabbiness
,
was
still
understood
to
be
in
some
sort
a
lady
's
man
,
in
right
of
his
upper
lip
and
his
frogs
,
indicated
a
doubt
of
the
justifiable
nature
of
these
measures
;
and
he
only
ogled
the
three
Miss
Chuzzlewits
with
the
least
admixture
of
banter
in
his
admiration
,
as
though
he
would
observe
,
"
You
are
positively
down
upon
her
to
too
great
an
extent
,
my
sweet
creatures
,
upon
my
soul
you
are

"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
crossing
his
two
forefingers
in
a
manner
which
was
at
once
conciliatory
and
argumentative
;
"
I
will
not
,
upon
the
one
hand
,
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
deserves
all
the
inflictions
which
have
been
so
very
forcibly
and
hilariously
suggested
;
"
one
of
his
ornamental
sentences
;
"
nor
will
I
,
upon
the
other
,
on
any
account
compromise
my
common
understanding
as
a
man
,
by
making
the
assertion
that
she
does
not

<EOS>
What
I
would
observe
is
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
some
practical
means
might
be
devised
of
inducing
our
respected

I
say
our
revered

"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
interposed
the
strong
-
minded
woman
in
a
loud
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
not
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
,
my
dear
madam

I
appreciate

thank
you

your
discriminating
objection

dispose
himself

cried
Mercy

<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
truth
is
,
my
dear

"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
smiling
upon
his
assembled
kindred
,
"
that
I
am
at
a
loss
for
a
word

<EOS>
The
name
of
those
fabulous
animals

pagan

I
regret
to
say
)
who
used
to
sing
in
the
water

has
quite
escaped
me

<EOS>
Mr
George
Chuzzlewit
suggested
"
swans

"
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not

<EOS>
Very
like
swans

too

<EOS>
Thank
you

The

with
the
outline
of
a
countenance
,
speaking
for
the
first
and
last
time
on
that
occasion
,
propounded
"
Oysters

<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
his
own
peculiar
urbanity
,
"
nor
oysters

<EOS>
But
by
no
means
unlike
oysters
;
a
very
excellent
idea
;
thank
you

my
dear
sir

very
much

Wait

Sirens

<EOS>
Dear
me

<EOS>
sirens
,
of

<EOS>
I
think
,
I
say
,
that
means
might
be
devised
of
disposing
our
respected
relative
to
listen
to
the
promptings
of
nature
,
and
not
to
the
siren
-
like
delusions
of
art

<EOS>
Now
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
our
esteemed
friend
has
a
grandson
,
to
whom
he
was
,
until
lately
,
very
much
attached
,
and
whom
I
could
have
wished
to
see
here
to

day

for
I
have
a
real

deep
regard
for
him

<EOS>
A
fine
young

<EOS>
a
very
fine
young
man

<EOS>
I
would
submit
to
you
,
whether
we
might
not
remove
Mr
Chuzzlewit
's
distrust
of
us
,
and
vindicate
our
own
disinterestedness
by

"
   
"
<EOS>
If
Mr
George
Chuzzlewit
has
anything
to
say
to
ME
,
"
interposed
the
strong
-
minded
woman
,
sternly
,
"
I
beg
him
to
speak
out
like
a
man
;
and
not
to
look
at
me
and
my
daughters
as
if
he
could
eat
us

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
looking
,
I
have
heard
it
said
,
Mrs
Ned
,
"
returned
Mr
George
,
angrily
,
"
that
a
cat
is
free
to
contemplate
a
monarch
;
and
therefore
I
hope
I
have
some
right
,
having
been
born
a
member
of
this
family
,
to
look
at
a
person
who
only
came
into
it
by
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
eating
,
I
beg
to
say
,
whatever
bitterness
your
jealousies
and
disappointed
expectations
may
suggest
to
you
,
that
I
am
not
a
cannibal

ma'am

<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
strong
-
minded
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
if
I
was
a
cannibal
,
"
said
Mr
George
Chuzzlewit
,
greatly
stimulated
by
this
retort
,
"
I
think
it
would
occur
to
me
that
a
lady
who
had
outlived
three
husbands
,
and
suffered
so
very
little
from
their
loss
,
must
be
most
uncommonly
tough
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
strong
-
minded
woman
immediately
rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
will
further
add
,
"
said
Mr
George
,
nodding
his
head
violently
at
every
second
syllable
;
"
naming
no
names
,
and
therefore
hurting
nobody
but
those
whose
consciences
tell
them
they
are
alluded
to
,
that
I
think
it
would
be
much
more
decent
and
becoming
,
if
those
who
hooked
and
crooked
themselves
into
this
family
by
getting
on
the
blind
side
of
some
of
its
members
before
marriage
,
and
manslaughtering
them
afterwards
by
crowing
over
them
to
that
strong
pitch
that
they
were
glad
to
die
,
would
refrain
from
acting
the
part
of
vultures
in
regard
to
other
members
of
this
family
who
are
living
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
full
as
well
,
if
not
better
,
if
those
individuals
would
keep
at
home
,
contenting
themselves
with
what
they
have
got
(
luckily
for
them
)
already
;
instead
of
hovering
about
,
and
thrusting
their
fingers
into
,
a
family
pie
,
which
they
flavour
much
more
than
enough
,
I
can
tell
them
,
when
they
are
fifty
miles
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
might
have
been
prepared
for
this
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
strong
-
minded
woman
,
looking
about
her
with
a
disdainful
smile
as
she
moved
towards
the
door
,
followed
by
her
three
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
was
fully
prepared
for
it
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
What
else
could
I
expect
in
such
an
atmosphere
as
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
direct
your
halfpay
-
officers
'
gaze
at
me
,
ma'am
,
if
you
please
,
"
interposed
Miss
Charity
;
"
for
I
wo
n't
bear
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
smart
stab
at
a
pension
enjoyed
by
the
strong
-
minded
woman
,
during
her
second
widowhood
and
before
her
last
coverture
.
<EOS>
It
told
immensely
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
passed
from
the
memory
of
a
grateful
country
,
you
very
miserable
minx
,
"
said
Mrs
Ned
,
"
when
I
entered
this
family
;
and
I
feel
now
,
though
I
did
not
feel
then
,
that
it
served
me
right
,
and
that
I
lost
my
claim
upon
the
United
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
when
I
so
degraded
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dears
,
if
you
're
quite
ready
,
and
have
sufficiently
improved
yourselves
by
taking
to
heart
the
genteel
example
of
these
two
young
ladies
,
I
think
we
'll
go
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
really
.
 
<EOS>
We
came
to
be
entertained
,
and
you
have
far
surpassed
our
utmost
expectations
,
in
the
amusement
you
have
provided
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Good

bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
such
departing
words
,
did
this
strong
-
minded
female
paralyse
the
Pecksniffian
energies
;
and
so
she
swept
out
of
the
room
,
and
out
of
the
house
,
attended
by
her
daughters
,
who
,
as
with
one
accord
,
elevated
their
three
noses
in
the
air
,
and
joined
in
a
contemptuous
titter
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
passed
the
parlour
window
on
the
outside
,
they
were
seen
to
counterfeit
a
perfect
transport
of
delight
among
themselves
;
and
with
this
final
blow
and
great
discouragement
for
those
within
,
they
vanished
.
   
<EOS>
Before
Mr
Pecksniff
or
any
of
his
remaining
visitors
could
offer
a
remark
,
another
figure
passed
this
window
,
coming
,
at
a
great
rate
in
the
opposite
direction
;
and
immediately
afterwards
,
Mr
Spottletoe
burst
into
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
Compared
with
his
present
state
of
heat
,
he
had
gone
out
a
man
of
snow
or
ice
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
distilled
such
oil
upon
his
whiskers
,
that
they
were
rich
and
clogged
with
unctuous
drops
;
his
face
was
violently
inflamed
,
his
limbs
trembled
;
and
he
gasped
and
strove
for
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
sir
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
"
returned
the
other
;
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
certainly
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
of
course

<EOS>
You
hear
him

<EOS>
You
hear
him
?
<EOS>
all
of
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
several
voices
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
nothing
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Spottletoe
,
still
gasping
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
!
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
consequence
!
 
<EOS>
Ask
him
!
 
<EOS>
HE'll
tell
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
our
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
about
him
in
utter
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
that
he
is
quite
unintelligible
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unintelligible
,
sir
!
"
cried
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Unintelligible
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
sir
,
that
you
do
n't
know
what
has
happened
!
 
<EOS>
That
you
have
n't
decoyed
us
here
,
and
laid
a
plot
and
a
plan
against
us
!
 
<EOS>
Will
you
venture
to
say
that
you
did
n't
know
Mr
Chuzzlewit
was
going
,
sir
,
and
that
you
do
n't
know
he
's
gone
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
<EOS>
was
the
general
cry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gone
,
"
echoed
Mr
Spottletoe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gone
while
we
were
sitting
here
.
<EOS>
Gone
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
where
he
's
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
of
course
not
!
 
<EOS>
Nobody
knew
he
was
going
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
of
course
not
!
 
<EOS>
The
landlady
thought
up
to
the
very
last
moment
that
they
were
merely
going
for
a
ride
;
she
had
no
other
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
of
course
not
!
 
<EOS>
She
's
not
this
fellow
's
creature
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
of
course
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
Adding
to
these
exclamations
a
kind
of
ironical
howl
,
and
gazing
upon
the
company
for
one
brief
instant
afterwards
,
in
a
sudden
silence
,
the
irritated
gentleman
started
off
again
at
the
same
tremendous
pace
,
and
was
seen
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
Mr
Pecksniff
to
assure
them
that
this
new
and
opportune
evasion
of
the
family
was
at
least
as
great
a
shock
and
surprise
to
him
as
to
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
bullyings
and
denunciations
that
were
ever
heaped
on
one
unlucky
head
,
none
can
ever
have
exceeded
in
energy
and
heartiness
those
with
which
he
was
complimented
by
each
of
his
remaining
relatives
,
singly
,
upon
bidding
him
farewell
.
   
<EOS>
The
moral
position
taken
by
Mr
Tigg
was
something
quite
tremendous
;
and
the
deaf
cousin
,
who
had
the
complicated
aggravation
of
seeing
all
the
proceedings
and
hearing
nothing
but
the
catastrophe
,
actually
scraped
her
shoes
upon
the
scraper
,
and
afterwards
distributed
impressions
of
them
all
over
the
top
step
,
in
token
that
she
shook
the
dust
from
her
feet
before
quitting
that
dissembling
and
perfidious
mansion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
,
in
short
,
but
one
comfort
,
and
that
was
the
knowledge
that
all
these
his
relations
and
friends
had
hated
him
to
the
very
utmost
extent
before
;
and
that
he
,
for
his
part
,
had
not
distributed
among
them
any
more
love
than
,
with
his
ample
capital
in
that
respect
,
he
could
comfortably
afford
to
part
with
.
 
<EOS>
This
view
of
his
affairs
yielded
him
great
consolation
;
and
the
fact
deserves
to
be
noted
,
as
showing
with
what
ease
a
good
man
may
be
consoled
under
circumstances
of
failure
and
disappointment
.

Containing
a
full
account
of
the
installation
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
new
pupil
into
the
bosom
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
the
festivities
held
on
that
occasion
,
and
the
great
enjoyment
of
Mr
Pinch
 
<EOS>
The
best
of
architects
and
land
surveyors
kept
a
horse
,
in
whom
the
enemies
already
mentioned
more
than
once
in
these
pages
pretended
to
detect
a
fanciful
resemblance
to
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
Not
in
his
outward
person
,
for
he
was
a
raw
-
boned
,
haggard
horse
,
always
on
a
much
shorter
allowance
of
corn
than
Mr
Pecksniff
;
but
in
his
moral
character
,
wherein
,
said
they
,
he
was
full
of
promise
,
but
of
no
performance
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
in
a
manner
,
going
to
go
,
and
never
going
.
 
<EOS>
When
at
his
slowest
rate
of
travelling
he
would
sometimes
lift
up
his
legs
so
high
,
and
display
such
mighty
action
,
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
he
was
doing
less
than
fourteen
miles
an
hour
;
and
he
was
for
ever
so
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
own
speed
,
and
so
little
disconcerted
by
opportunities
of
comparing
himself
with
the
fastest
trotters
,
that
the
illusion
was
the
more
difficult
of
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
kind
of
animal
who
infused
into
the
breasts
of
strangers
a
lively
sense
of
hope
,
and
possessed
all
those
who
knew
him
better
with
a
grim
despair
.
 
<EOS>
In
what
respect
,
having
these
points
of
character
,
he
might
be
fairly
likened
to
his
master
,
that
good
man
's
slanderers
only
can
explain
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
a
melancholy
truth
,
and
a
deplorable
instance
of
the
uncharitableness
of
the
world
,
that
they
made
the
comparison
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
horse
,
and
the
hooded
vehicle
,
whatever
its
proper
name
might
be
,
to
which
he
was
usually
harnessed
---
it
was
more
like
a
gig
with
a
tumour
than
anything
else
---
<EOS>
all
Mr
Pinch
's
thoughts
and
wishes
centred
,
one
bright
frosty
morning
;
for
with
this
gallant
equipage
he
was
about
to
drive
to
Salisbury
alone
,
there
to
meet
with
the
new
pupil
,
and
thence
to
bring
him
home
in
triumph
.
   
<EOS>
Blessings
on
thy
simple
heart
,
Tom
Pinch
<EOS>
,
how
proudly
dost
thou
button
up
that
scanty
coat
,
called
by
a
sad
misnomer
,
for
these
many
years
,
a
"
great
"
one
;
and
how
thoroughly
,
as
with
thy
cheerful
voice
thou
pleasantly
adjurest
Sam
the
hostler
"
<EOS>
not
to
let
him
go
yet
,
"
dost
thou
believe
that
quadruped
desires
to
go
,
and
would
go
if
he
might
!
 
<EOS>
Who
could
repress
a
smile
---
of
love
for
thee
,
Tom
Pinch
,
and
not
in
jest
at
thy
expense
,
for
thou
art
poor
enough
already
<EOS>
,
Heaven
knows
---
to
think
that
such
a
holiday
as
lies
before
thee
should
awaken
that
quick
flow
and
hurry
of
the
spirits
,
in
which
thou
settest
down
again
,
almost
untasted
,
on
the
kitchen
window
-
sill
,
that
great
white
mug
(
put
by
,
by
thy
own
hands
,
last
night
,
that
breakfast
might
not
hold
thee
late
)
,
and
layest
yonder
crust
upon
the
seat
beside
thee
,
to
be
eaten
on
the
road
,
when
thou
art
calmer
in
thy
high
rejoicing
!
 
<EOS>
Who
,
as
thou
drivest
off
,
a
happy
,
man
,
and
noddest
with
a
grateful
lovingness
to
Pecksniff
in
his
nightcap
at
his
chamber
-
window
,
would
not
cry
,
"
Heaven
speed
thee
,
Tom
,
and
send
that
thou
wert
going
off
for
ever
to
some
quiet
home
where
thou
mightst
live
at
peace
,
and
sorrow
should
not
touch
thee
!
"
   
<EOS>
What
better
time
for
driving
,
riding
,
walking
,
moving
through
the
air
by
any
means
,
than
a
fresh
,
frosty
morning
,
when
hope
runs
cheerily
through
the
veins
with
the
brisk
blood
,
and
tingles
in
the
frame
from
head
to
foot
!
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
glad
commencement
of
a
bracing
day
in
early
winter
,
such
as
may
put
the
languid
summer
season
(
speaking
of
it
when
it
ca
n't
be
had
)
to
the
blush
,
and
shame
the
spring
for
being
sometimes
cold
by
halves
.
 
<EOS>
The
sheep
-
bells
rang
as
clearly
in
the
vigorous
air
,
as
if
they
felt
its
wholesome
influence
like
living
creatures
;
the
trees
,
in
lieu
of
leaves
or
blossoms
,
shed
upon
the
ground
a
frosty
rime
that
sparkled
as
it
fell
,
and
might
have
been
the
dust
of
diamonds
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
was
to
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
From
cottage
chimneys
,
smoke
went
streaming
up
high
,
high
,
as
if
the
earth
had
lost
its
grossness
,
being
so
fair
,
and
must
not
be
oppressed
by
heavy
vapour
.
 
<EOS>
The
crust
of
ice
on
the
else
rippling
brook
was
so
transparent
,
and
so
thin
in
texture
,
that
the
lively
water
might
of
its
own
free
will
have
stopped
---
in
Tom
's
glad
mind
<EOS>
it
had
---
to
look
upon
the
lovely
morning
.
 
<EOS>
And
lest
the
sun
should
break
this
charm
too
eagerly
,
there
moved
between
him
and
the
ground
,
a
mist
like
that
which
waits
upon
the
moon
on
summer
nights
---
the
very
same
to
Tom
---
and
wooed
him
to
dissolve
it
gently
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
went
on
;
not
fast
,
but
with
a
sense
of
rapid
motion
,
which
did
just
as
well
;
and
as
he
went
,
all
kinds
of
things
occurred
to
keep
him
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
when
he
came
within
sight
of
the
turnpike
,
and
was
---
oh
a
long
way
off
!
<EOS>
---
he
saw
the
tollman
's
wife
,
who
had
that
moment
checked
a
waggon
,
run
back
into
the
little
house
again
like
mad
,
to
say
(
she
knew
)
that
Mr
Pinch
was
coming
up
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
was
right
,
for
when
he
drew
within
hail
of
the
gate
,
forth
rushed
the
tollman
's
children
,
shrieking
in
tiny
chorus
,
"
Mr
Pinch
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
Tom
's
intense
delight
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
tollman
,
though
an
ugly
chap
in
general
,
and
one
whom
folks
were
rather
shy
of
handling
,
came
out
himself
to
take
the
toll
,
and
give
him
rough
good
morning
;
and
that
with
all
this
,
and
a
glimpse
of
the
family
breakfast
on
a
little
round
table
before
the
fire
,
the
crust
Tom
Pinch
had
brought
away
with
him
acquired
as
rich
a
flavour
as
though
it
had
been
cut
from
a
fairy
loaf
.
   
<EOS>
But
there
was
more
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
the
married
people
and
the
children
who
gave
Tom
Pinch
a
welcome
as
he
passed
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
Sparkling
eyes
and
snowy
breasts
came
hurriedly
to
many
an
upper
casement
as
he
clattered
by
,
and
gave
him
back
his
greeting
:
not
stinted
either
,
but
sevenfold
,
good
measure
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
merry
.
<EOS>
They
all
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
And
some
of
the
wickedest
among
them
even
kissed
their
hands
as
Tom
looked
back
.
 
<EOS>
For
who
minded
poor
Mr
Pinch
?
<EOS>
There
was
no
harm
in
HIM
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
the
morning
grew
so
fair
,
and
all
things
were
so
wide
awake
and
gay
,
that
the
sun
seeming
to
say
---
Tom
had
no
doubt
he
said
---
"
I
ca
n't
stand
it
any
longer
;
I
must
have
a
look
,
"
streamed
out
in
radiant
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
The
mist
,
too
shy
and
gentle
for
such
lusty
company
,
fled
off
,
quite
scared
,
before
it
;
and
as
it
swept
away
,
the
hills
and
mounds
and
distant
pasture
lands
,
teeming
with
placid
sheep
and
noisy
crows
,
came
out
as
bright
as
though
they
were
unrolled
bran
new
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
In
compliment
to
which
discovery
,
the
brook
stood
still
no
longer
,
but
ran
briskly
off
to
bear
the
tidings
to
the
water
-
mill
,
three
miles
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
was
jogging
along
,
full
of
pleasant
thoughts
and
cheerful
influences
,
when
he
saw
,
upon
the
path
before
him
,
going
in
the
same
direction
with
himself
,
a
traveller
on
foot
,
who
walked
with
a
light
quick
step
,
and
sang
as
he
went
---
for
certain
in
a
very
loud
voice
,
but
not
unmusically
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
fellow
,
of
some
five
or
six
-
and
-
twenty
perhaps
,
and
was
dressed
in
such
a
free
and
fly
-
away
fashion
,
that
the
long
ends
of
his
loose
red
neckcloth
were
streaming
out
behind
him
quite
as
often
as
before
;
and
the
bunch
of
bright
winter
berries
in
the
buttonhole
of
his
velveteen
coat
was
as
visible
to
Mr
Pinch
's
rearward
observation
,
as
if
he
had
worn
that
garment
wrong
side
foremost
.
 
<EOS>
He
continued
to
sing
with
so
much
energy
,
that
he
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
wheels
until
it
was
close
behind
him
;
when
he
turned
a
whimsical
face
and
a
very
merry
pair
of
blue
eyes
on
Mr
Pinch
,
and
checked
himself
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mark
?
"
said
Tom
Pinch
,
stopping
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
'd
have
thought
of
seeing
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
this
is
surprising
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
touched
his
hat
,
and
said
,
with
a
very
sudden
decrease
of
vivacity
,
that
he
was
going
to
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
spruce
you
are
,
too
!
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
surveying
him
with
great
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Really
,
I
did
n't
think
you
were
half
such
a
tight
-
made
fellow
,
Mark
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
well
for
that
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
my
fault
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
With
regard
to
being
spruce
,
sir
,
that
's
where
it
is
,
you
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
here
he
looked
particularly
gloomy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
what
is
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
the
aggravation
of
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Any
man
may
be
in
good
spirits
and
good
temper
when
he
's
well
dressed
.
 
<EOS>
There
an't
much
credit
in
that
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
very
ragged
and
very
jolly
,
then
I
should
begin
to
feel
I
had
gained
a
point
,
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
were
singing
just
now
,
to
bear
up
,
as
it
were
,
against
being
well
dressed
,
eh
,
Mark
?
"
said
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
conversation
's
always
equal
to
print
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mark
,
with
a
broad
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
cried
Pinch
,
"
you
are
the
strangest
young
man
,
Mark
<EOS>
,
I
ever
knew
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
thought
so
;
but
now
I
am
quite
certain
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
Salisbury
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
get
in
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
fellow
made
his
acknowledgments
and
accepted
the
offer
;
stepping
into
the
carriage
directly
,
and
seating
himself
on
the
very
edge
of
the
seat
with
his
body
half
out
of
it
,
to
express
his
being
there
on
sufferance
,
and
by
the
politeness
of
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
went
along
,
the
conversation
proceeded
after
this
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
more
than
half
believed
,
just
now
,
seeing
you
so
very
smart
,
"
said
Pinch
,
"
that
you
must
be
going
to
be
married
,
Mark
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
've
thought
of
that
,
too
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
might
be
some
credit
in
being
jolly
with
a
wife
,
"
specially
if
the
children
had
the
measles
and
that
,
and
was
very
fractious
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
a'most
afraid
to
try
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
my
way
clear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
very
fond
of
anybody
,
perhaps
?
"
said
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
particular
,
sir
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
way
would
be
,
you
know
,
Mark
,
according
to
your
views
of
things
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
"
to
marry
somebody
you
did
n't
like
,
and
who
was
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
it
would
,
sir
;
but
that
might
be
carrying
out
a
principle
a
little
too
far
,
might
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
might
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
At
which
they
both
laughed
gaily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
you
do
n't
half
know
me
,
though
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
there
ever
was
a
man
as
could
come
out
so
strong
under
circumstances
that
would
make
other
men
miserable
,
as
I
could
,
if
I
could
only
get
a
chance
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
get
a
chance
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
my
opinion
that
nobody
never
will
know
half
of
what
's
in
me
,
unless
something
very
unexpected
turns
up
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
see
any
prospect
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
-
going
to
leave
the
Dragon
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
to
leave
the
Dragon
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Pinch
,
looking
at
him
with
great
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mark
,
you
take
my
breath
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
he
rejoined
,
looking
straight
before
him
and
a
long
way
off
,
as
men
do
sometimes
when
they
cogitate
profoundly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
of
my
stopping
at
the
Dragon
?
 
<EOS>
It
an't
at
all
the
sort
of
place
for
ME
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
left
London
(
I
'm
a
Kentish
man
by
birth
,
though
)
,
and
took
that
situation
here
,
I
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
the
dullest
little
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
corner
in
England
,
and
that
there
would
be
some
credit
in
being
jolly
under
such
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
,
there
's
no
dullness
at
the
Dragon
!
 
<EOS>
Skittles
,
cricket
,
quoits
,
nine
-
pins
,
comic
songs
,
choruses
,
company
round
the
chimney
corner
every
winter
's
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Any
man
could
be
jolly
at
the
Dragon
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
credit
in
THAT
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
if
common
report
be
true
for
once
,
Mark
,
as
I
think
it
is
,
being
able
to
confirm
it
by
what
I
know
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
"
you
are
the
cause
of
half
this
merriment
,
and
set
it
going
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
may
be
something
in
that
,
too
,
sir
,
"
answered
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
that
's
no
consolation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
after
a
short
silence
,
his
usually
subdued
tone
being
even
now
more
subdued
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
think
enough
of
what
you
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
what
will
become
of
Mrs
Lupin
,
Mark
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
looked
more
fixedly
before
him
,
and
further
off
still
,
as
he
answered
that
he
did
n't
suppose
it
would
be
much
of
an
object
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
plenty
of
smart
young
fellows
as
would
be
glad
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
a
dozen
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
probable
enough
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
"
but
I
am
not
at
all
sure
that
Mrs
Lupin
would
be
glad
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
always
supposed
that
Mrs
Lupin
and
you
would
make
a
match
of
it
,
Mark
;
and
so
did
every
one
,
as
far
as
I
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
"
Mark
replied
,
in
some
confusion
,
"
said
nothing
as
was
in
a
direct
way
courting
-
<EOS>
like
to
her
,
nor
she
to
me
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
might
n't
do
one
of
these
odd
times
,
and
what
she
might
n't
say
in
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
THAT
would
n't
suit
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
to
be
landlord
of
the
Dragon
,
Mark
?
"
cried
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
certainly
not
,
"
returned
the
other
,
withdrawing
his
gaze
from
the
horizon
,
and
looking
at
his
fellow
-
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
that
would
be
the
ruin
of
a
man
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
and
sit
down
comfortably
for
life
,
and
no
man
never
finds
me
out
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
be
the
credit
of
the
landlord
of
the
Dragon
's
being
jolly
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
he
could
n't
help
it
,
if
he
tried
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Does
Mrs
Lupin
know
you
are
going
to
leave
her
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
broke
it
to
her
yet
,
sir
,
but
I
must
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
looking
out
this
morning
for
something
new
and
suitable
,
"
he
said
,
nodding
towards
the
city
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
kind
of
thing
now
?
"
Mr
Pinch
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
,
"
Mark
replied
,
"
of
something
in
the
grave
-
digging
.
<EOS>
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Good
gracious
,
Mark
?
"
cried
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
good
damp
,
wormy
sort
of
business
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
shaking
his
head
argumentatively
,
"
and
there
might
be
some
credit
in
being
jolly
,
with
one
's
mind
in
that
pursuit
,
unless
grave
-
diggers
is
usually
given
that
way
;
which
would
be
a
drawback
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
happen
to
know
how
that
is
in
general
,
do
you
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
n't
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
case
of
that
not
turning
out
as
well
as
one
could
wish
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mark
,
musing
again
,
"
there
's
other
businesses
.
<EOS>
Undertaking
now
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
There
might
be
credit
to
be
gained
there
.
 
<EOS>
A
broker
's
man
in
a
poor
neighbourhood
would
n't
be
bad
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
A
jailor
sees
a
deal
of
misery
.
 
<EOS>
A
doctor
's
man
is
in
the
very
midst
of
murder
.
 
<EOS>
A
bailiff
's
an't
a
lively
office
nat'rally
.
<EOS>
Even
a
tax
-
gatherer
must
find
his
feelings
rather
worked
upon
,
at
times
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
lots
of
trades
in
which
I
should
have
an
opportunity
,
I
think
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
was
so
perfectly
overwhelmed
by
these
remarks
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
occasionally
exchange
a
word
or
two
on
some
indifferent
subject
,
and
cast
sidelong
glances
at
the
bright
face
of
his
odd
friend
(
who
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
his
observation
)
,
until
they
reached
a
certain
corner
of
the
road
,
close
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
city
,
when
Mark
said
he
would
jump
down
there
,
if
he
pleased
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
bless
my
soul
,
Mark
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
who
in
the
progress
of
his
observation
just
then
made
the
discovery
that
the
bosom
of
his
companion
's
shirt
was
as
much
exposed
as
if
it
was
Midsummer
,
and
was
ruffled
by
every
breath
of
air
,
"
why
do
n't
you
wear
a
waistcoat
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
good
of
one
,
sir
?
"
asked
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
of
one
?
"
said
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
keep
your
chest
warm
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
love
you
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
,
"
you
do
n't
know
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
chest
do
n't
want
no
warming
.
 
<EOS>
Even
if
it
did
,
what
would
no
waistcoat
bring
it
to
?
 
<EOS>
Inflammation
of
the
lungs
,
perhaps
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
there
'd
be
some
credit
in
being
jolly
,
with
a
inflammation
of
the
lungs
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pinch
returned
no
other
answer
than
such
as
was
conveyed
in
his
breathing
very
hard
,
and
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
,
and
nodding
his
head
very
much
,
Mark
thanked
him
for
his
ride
,
and
without
troubling
him
to
stop
,
jumped
lightly
down
.
 
<EOS>
And
away
he
fluttered
,
with
his
red
neckerchief
,
and
<EOS>
his
open
coat
,
down
a
cross
-
lane
;
turning
back
from
time
to
time
to
nod
to
Mr
Pinch
,
and
looking
one
of
the
most
careless
,
good
-
humoured
comical
fellows
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
His
late
companion
,
with
a
thoughtful
face
pursued
his
way
to
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
had
a
shrewd
notion
that
Salisbury
was
a
very
desperate
sort
of
place
;
an
exceeding
wild
and
dissipated
city
;
and
when
he
had
put
up
the
horse
,
and
given
the
hostler
to
understand
that
he
would
look
in
again
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
to
see
him
take
his
corn
,
he
set
forth
on
a
stroll
about
the
streets
with
a
vague
and
not
unpleasant
idea
that
they
teemed
with
all
kinds
of
mystery
and
bedevilment
.
 
<EOS>
To
one
of
his
quiet
habits
this
little
delusion
was
greatly
assisted
by
the
circumstance
of
its
being
market
-
day
,
and
the
thoroughfares
about
the
market
-
place
being
filled
with
carts
,
horses
,
donkeys
,
baskets
,
waggons
,
garden
-
stuff
,
meat
,
tripe
,
pies
,
poultry
and
huckster
's
wares
of
every
opposite
description
and
possible
variety
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
were
young
farmers
and
old
farmers
with
smock
-
frocks
,
brown
great
-
coats
,
drab
great
-
coats
,
red
worsted
comforters
,
leather
-
leggings
,
wonderful
shaped
hats
,
hunting
-
whips
,
and
rough
sticks
,
standing
about
in
groups
,
or
talking
noisily
together
on
the
tavern
steps
,
or
paying
and
receiving
huge
amounts
of
greasy
wealth
,
with
the
assistance
of
such
bulky
pocket
-
books
that
when
they
were
in
their
pockets
it
was
apoplexy
to
get
them
out
,
and
when
they
were
out
it
was
spasms
to
get
them
in
again
.
 
<EOS>
Also
there
were
farmers
'
wives
in
beaver
bonnets
and
red
cloaks
,
riding
shaggy
horses
purged
of
all
earthly
passions
,
who
went
soberly
into
all
manner
of
places
without
desiring
to
know
why
,
and
who
,
if
required
,
would
have
stood
stock
still
in
a
china
shop
,
with
a
complete
dinner
-
service
at
each
hoof
.
 
<EOS>
Also
a
great
many
dogs
,
who
were
strongly
interested
in
the
state
of
the
market
and
the
bargains
of
their
masters
;
and
a
great
confusion
of
tongues
,
both
brute
and
human
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
regarded
everything
exposed
for
sale
with
great
delight
,
and
was
particularly
struck
by
the
itinerant
cutlery
,
which
he
considered
of
the
very
keenest
kind
,
insomuch
that
he
purchased
a
pocket
knife
with
seven
blades
in
it
,
and
not
a
cut
(
as
he
afterwards
found
out
)
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
exhausted
the
market
-
place
,
and
watched
the
farmers
safe
into
the
market
dinner
,
he
went
back
to
look
after
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Having
seen
him
eat
unto
his
heart
's
content
he
issued
forth
again
,
to
wander
round
the
town
and
regale
himself
with
the
shop
windows
;
previously
taking
a
long
stare
at
the
bank
,
and
wondering
in
what
direction
underground
the
caverns
might
be
where
they
kept
the
money
;
and
turning
to
look
back
at
one
or
two
young
men
who
passed
him
,
whom
he
knew
to
be
articled
to
solicitors
in
the
town
;
and
who
had
a
sort
of
fearful
interest
in
his
eyes
,
as
jolly
dogs
who
knew
a
thing
or
two
,
and
kept
it
up
tremendously
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
shops
.
 
<EOS>
First
of
all
there
were
the
jewellers
'
shops
,
with
all
the
treasures
of
the
earth
displayed
therein
,
and
such
large
silver
watches
hanging
up
in
every
pane
of
glass
,
that
if
they
were
anything
but
first
-
rate
goers
it
certainly
was
not
because
the
works
could
decently
complain
of
want
of
room
.
 
<EOS>
In
good
sooth
they
were
big
enough
,
and
perhaps
,
as
the
saying
is
,
ugly
enough
,
to
be
the
most
correct
of
all
mechanical
performers
;
in
Mr
Pinch
's
eyes
,
however
they
were
smaller
than
Geneva
ware
;
and
when
he
saw
one
very
bloated
watch
announced
as
a
repeater
,
gifted
with
the
uncommon
power
of
striking
every
quarter
of
an
hour
inside
the
pocket
of
its
happy
owner
,
he
almost
wished
that
he
were
rich
enough
to
buy
it
.
   
<EOS>
But
what
were
even
gold
and
silver
,
precious
stones
and
clockwork
,
to
the
bookshops
,
whence
a
pleasant
smell
of
paper
freshly
pressed
<EOS>
came
issuing
forth
,
awakening
instant
recollections
of
some
new
grammar
had
at
school
,
long
time
ago
,
with
"
Master
Pinch
,
Grove
House
Academy
,
"
inscribed
in
faultless
writing
on
the
fly
-
leaf
!
 
<EOS>
That
whiff
of
russia
leather
,
too
,
and
all
those
rows
on
rows
of
volumes
neatly
ranged
within
---
what
happiness
did
they
suggest
!
 
<EOS>
And
in
the
window
were
the
spick
-
and
-
span
new
works
from
London
,
with
the
title
-
pages
,
and
sometimes
even
the
first
page
of
the
first
chapter
,
laid
wide
open
;
tempting
unwary
men
to
begin
to
read
the
book
,
and
then
,
in
the
impossibility
of
turning
over
,
to
rush
blindly
in
,
and
buy
it
!
 
<EOS>
Here
too
were
the
dainty
frontispiece
and
trim
vignette
,
pointing
like
handposts
on
the
outskirts
of
great
cities
,
to
the
rich
stock
of
incident
beyond
;
and
store
of
books
,
with
many
a
grave
portrait
and
time
-
honoured
name
,
<EOS>
whose
matter
he
knew
well
,
and
would
have
given
mines
to
have
,
in
any
form
,
upon
the
narrow
shell
beside
his
bed
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
heart
-
breaking
shop
it
was
!
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
;
not
quite
so
bad
at
first
,
but
still
a
trying
shop
;
where
children
's
books
were
sold
,
and
where
poor
Robinson
Crusoe
stood
alone
in
his
might
,
with
dog
and
hatchet
,
goat
-
skin
cap
and
fowling
-
pieces
;
calmly
surveying
Philip
Quarn
and
the
host
of
imitators
round
him
,
and
calling
Mr
Pinch
to
witness
that
he
,
of
all
the
crowd
,
impressed
one
solitary
footprint
on
the
shore
of
boyish
memory
,
whereof
the
tread
of
generations
should
not
stir
the
lightest
grain
of
sand
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
too
were
the
Persian
tales
,
with
flying
chests
and
students
of
enchanted
books
shut
up
for
years
in
caverns
;
and
there
too
was
Abudah
,
the
merchant
,
with
the
terrible
little
old
woman
hobbling
out
of
the
box
in
his
bedroom
;
and
there
the
mighty
talisman
,
the
rare
Arabian
Nights
,
with
Cassim
Baba
,
divided
by
four
,
like
the
ghost
of
a
dreadful
sum
,
<EOS>
hanging
up
,
all
gory
,
in
the
robbers
'
cave
.
 
<EOS>
Which
matchless
wonders
,
coming
fast
on
Mr
Pinch
's
mind
,
did
so
rub
up
and
chafe
that
wonderful
lamp
within
him
,
that
when
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
busy
street
,
a
crowd
of
phantoms
waited
on
his
pleasure
,
and
he
lived
again
,
with
new
delight
,
the
happy
days
before
the
Pecksniff
era
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
less
interest
now
in
the
chemists
'
shops
,
with
their
great
glowing
bottles
(
with
smaller
repositories
of
brightness
in
their
very
stoppers
)
;
and
in
their
agreeable
compromises
between
medicine
and
perfumery
,
in
the
shape
of
toothsome
lozenges
and
virgin
honey
.
<EOS>
Neither
had
he
the
least
regard
(
but
he
never
had
much
)
for
the
tailors
'
,
where
the
newest
metropolitan
waistcoat
patterns
were
hanging
up
,
which
by
some
strange
transformation
always
looked
amazing
there
,
and
never
appeared
at
all
like
the
same
thing
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
stopped
to
read
the
playbill
at
the
theatre
and
surveyed
the
doorway
with
a
kind
of
awe
,
which
was
not
diminished
when
a
sallow
gentleman
with
long
dark
hair
came
out
,
and
told
a
boy
to
run
home
to
his
lodgings
and
bring
down
his
broadsword
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
on
hearing
this
,
and
might
have
stood
there
until
dark
,
but
that
the
old
cathedral
bell
began
to
ring
for
vesper
service
,
on
which
he
tore
himself
away
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
organist
's
assistant
was
a
friend
of
Mr
Pinch
's
,
which
was
a
good
thing
,
for
he
too
was
a
very
quiet
gentle
soul
,
and
had
been
,
like
Tom
,
a
kind
of
old
-
fashioned
boy
at
school
,
though
well
liked
by
the
noisy
fellow
too
.
 
<EOS>
As
good
luck
would
have
it
<EOS>
(
Tom
always
said
he
had
great
good
luck
)
<EOS>
the
assistant
chanced
that
very
afternoon
to
be
on
duty
by
himself
,
with
no
one
in
the
dusty
organ
loft
<EOS>
but
Tom
;
so
while
he
played
,
Tom
helped
him
with
the
stops
;
and
finally
,
the
service
being
just
over
,
Tom
took
the
organ
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
turning
dark
,
and
the
yellow
light
that
streamed
in
through
the
ancient
windows
in
the
choir
was
mingled
with
a
murky
red
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
grand
tones
resounded
through
the
church
,
they
seemed
,
to
Tom
,
to
find
an
echo
in
the
depth
of
every
ancient
tomb
,
no
less
than
in
the
deep
mystery
of
his
own
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Great
thoughts
and
hopes
came
crowding
on
his
mind
as
the
rich
music
rolled
upon
the
air
and
yet
among
them
---
something
more
grave
and
solemn
in
their
purpose
,
but
the
same
---
were
all
the
images
of
that
day
,
down
to
its
very
lightest
recollection
of
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
The
feeling
that
the
sounds
awakened
,
in
the
moment
of
their
existence
,
seemed
to
include
his
whole
life
and
being
;
and
as
the
surrounding
realities
of
stone
and
wood
and
glass
grew
dimmer
in
the
darkness
,
these
visions
grew
so
much
the
brighter
that
Tom
might
have
forgotten
the
new
pupil
and
the
expectant
master
,
and
have
sat
there
pouring
out
his
grateful
heart
till
midnight
,
but
for
a
very
earthy
old
verger
insisting
on
locking
up
the
cathedral
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
took
leave
of
his
friend
,
with
many
thanks
,
groped
his
way
out
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
into
the
now
lamp
-
lighted
streets
,
and
hurried
off
to
get
his
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
farmers
being
by
this
time
<EOS>
jogging
homewards
,
there
was
nobody
in
the
sanded
parlour
of
the
tavern
where
he
had
left
the
horse
;
so
he
had
his
little
table
drawn
out
close
before
the
fire
,
and
fell
to
work
upon
a
well
-
cooked
steak
and
smoking
hot
potatoes
,
with
a
strong
appreciation
of
their
excellence
,
and
a
very
keen
sense
of
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
him
,
too
,
there
stood
a
jug
of
most
stupendous
Wiltshire
beer
;
and
the
effect
of
the
whole
was
so
transcendent
,
that
he
was
obliged
every
now
and
then
to
lay
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
rub
his
hands
,
and
think
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
the
cheese
and
celery
came
,
Mr
Pinch
had
taken
a
book
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
could
afford
to
trifle
with
the
viands
;
now
eating
a
little
,
now
drinking
a
little
,
now
reading
a
little
,
and
now
stopping
to
wonder
what
sort
of
a
young
man
the
new
pupil
would
turn
out
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
passed
from
this
latter
theme
and
was
deep
in
his
book
again
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
another
guest
came
in
,
bringing
with
him
such
a
quantity
of
cold
air
,
that
he
positively
seemed
at
first
to
put
the
fire
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
hard
frost
to
-
night
,
sir
,
"
said
the
newcomer
,
courteously
acknowledging
Mr
Pinch
's
withdrawal
of
the
little
table
,
that
he
might
have
place
:
"
Do
n't
disturb
yourself
,
I
beg
.
"
   
<EOS>
Though
he
said
this
with
a
vast
amount
of
consideration
for
Mr
Pinch
's
comfort
,
he
dragged
one
of
the
great
leather
-
bottomed
chairs
to
the
very
centre
of
the
hearth
,
notwithstanding
;
and
sat
down
in
front
of
the
fire
,
with
a
foot
on
each
hob
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
feet
are
quite
numbed
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Bitter
cold
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
in
the
air
some
considerable
time
,
I
dare
say
?
"
said
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
day
.
 
<EOS>
Outside
a
coach
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
accounts
for
his
making
the
room
so
cool
,
"
thought
Mr
Pinch
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
How
thoroughly
chilled
he
must
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
became
thoughtful
likewise
,
and
sat
for
five
or
ten
minutes
looking
at
the
fire
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
rose
and
divested
himself
of
his
shawl
and
great
-
coat
,
which
(
far
different
from
Mr
Pinch
's
)
was
a
very
warm
and
thick
one
;
but
he
was
not
a
whit
more
conversational
out
of
his
great
-
coat
than
in
it
,
for
he
sat
down
again
in
the
same
place
and
attitude
,
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
began
to
bite
his
nails
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
young
---
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
perhaps
---
and
handsome
;
with
a
keen
dark
eye
,
and
a
quickness
of
look
and
manner
which
made
Tom
sensible
of
a
great
contrast
in
his
own
bearing
,
and
caused
him
to
feel
even
more
shy
than
usual
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
clock
in
the
room
,
which
the
stranger
often
turned
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
made
frequent
reference
to
it
also
;
partly
from
a
nervous
sympathy
with
its
taciturn
companion
;
and
partly
because
the
new
pupil
was
to
inquire
for
him
at
half
after
six
,
and
the
hands
were
getting
on
towards
that
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
the
stranger
caught
him
looking
at
this
clock
,
a
kind
of
confusion
came
upon
Tom
as
if
he
had
been
found
out
in
something
;
and
it
was
a
perception
of
his
uneasiness
which
caused
the
younger
man
to
say
,
perhaps
,
with
a
smile
:
   
"
We
both
appear
to
be
rather
particular
about
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
have
an
engagement
to
meet
a
gentleman
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
have
I
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
half
-
past
six
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
half
-
past
six
,
"
said
Tom
in
the
very
same
breath
;
whereupon
the
other
looked
at
him
with
some
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
I
expect
,
"
remarked
Tom
,
timidly
,
"
was
to
inquire
at
that
time
for
a
person
by
the
name
of
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
cried
the
other
,
jumping
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
been
keeping
the
fire
from
you
all
this
while
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
idea
<EOS>
you
were
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
Mr
Martin
for
whom
you
were
to
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
draw
nearer
,
pray
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
cold
,
and
you
are
;
and
we
have
a
cold
ride
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
am
very
glad
,
"
said
Tom
,
smiling
with
an
embarrassed
frankness
peculiarly
his
,
and
which
was
as
plainly
a
confession
of
his
own
imperfections
,
and
an
appeal
to
the
kindness
of
the
person
he
addressed
,
as
if
he
had
drawn
one
up
in
simple
language
and
committed
it
to
paper
:
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
indeed
that
you
turn
out
to
be
the
party
I
expected
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
thinking
,
but
a
minute
ago
,
that
I
could
wish
him
to
be
like
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
returned
Martin
,
shaking
hands
with
him
again
;
"
for
I
assure
you
,
I
was
thinking
there
could
be
no
such
luck
as
Mr
Pinch
's
turning
out
like
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
really
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
with
great
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
serious
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
am
,
"
replied
his
new
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
and
I
will
get
on
excellently
well
,
I
know
;
which
it
's
no
small
relief
to
me
to
feel
,
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
<EOS>
,
I
am
not
at
all
the
sort
of
fellow
who
could
get
on
with
everybody
,
and
that
's
the
point
on
which
I
had
the
greatest
doubts
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
're
quite
relieved
now
.
<EOS>
---
Do
me
the
favour
to
ring
the
bell
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
rose
,
and
complied
with
great
alacrity
---
the
handle
hung
just
over
Martin
's
head
,
as
he
warmed
himself
---
and
listened
with
a
smiling
face
to
what
his
friend
went
on
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
:
   
"
<EOS>
If
you
like
punch
,
you
'll
allow
me
to
order
a
glass
<EOS>
apiece
,
as
hot
as
it
can
be
made
,
that
we
may
usher
in
our
friendship
in
a
becoming
manner
.
 
<EOS>
To
let
you
into
a
secret
,
Mr
Pinch
,
I
never
was
so
much
in
want
of
something
warm
and
cheering
in
my
life
;
but
I
did
n't
like
to
run
the
chance
of
being
found
drinking
it
,
without
knowing
what
kind
of
person
you
were
;
for
first
impressions
,
you
know
,
often
go
a
long
way
,
and
last
a
long
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
assented
,
and
the
punch
was
ordered
.
 
<EOS>
In
due
course
it
came
;
hot
and
strong
.
 
<EOS>
After
drinking
to
each
other
in
the
steaming
mixture
,
they
became
quite
confidential
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
sort
of
relation
of
Pecksniff
's
,
you
know
,
"
said
the
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
cried
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
My
grandfather
is
his
cousin
,
so
he
's
kith
and
kin
to
me
,
somehow
,
if
you
can
make
that
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
Martin
is
your
Christian
name
?
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
,
"
returned
his
friend
:
"
<EOS>
I
wish
it
was
my
surname
for
my
own
<EOS>
is
not
a
very
pretty
one
,
and
it
takes
a
long
time
to
sign
Chuzzlewit
<EOS>
is
my
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
cried
Mr
Pinch
,
with
an
involuntary
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
surprised
at
my
having
two
names
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
returned
the
other
,
setting
his
glass
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
Most
people
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
"
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
Well
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
remembering
that
Mr
Pecksniff
had
privately
cautioned
him
to
say
nothing
in
reference
to
the
old
gentleman
of
the
same
name
who
had
lodged
at
the
Dragon
,
but
to
reserve
all
mention
of
that
person
for
him
,
he
had
no
better
means
of
hiding
his
confusion
than
by
raising
his
own
glass
to
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
at
each
other
out
of
their
respective
tumblers
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
then
put
them
down
empty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
them
in
the
stable
to
be
ready
for
us
ten
minutes
ago
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
glancing
at
the
clock
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
"
returned
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
drive
?
"
said
Mr
Pinch
;
his
whole
face
beaming
with
a
consciousness
of
the
splendour
of
his
offer
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
,
if
you
wish
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
that
depends
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Martin
,
laughing
,
"
upon
what
sort
of
a
horse
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
Because
if
he
's
a
bad
one
,
I
would
rather
keep
my
hands
warm
by
holding
them
comfortably
in
my
greatcoat
pockets
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
think
this
such
a
good
joke
,
that
Mr
Pinch
was
quite
sure
it
must
be
a
capital
one
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
laughed
too
,
and
was
fully
persuaded
that
he
enjoyed
it
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
settled
his
bill
,
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
paid
for
the
punch
;
and
having
wrapped
themselves
up
,
to
the
extent
of
their
respective
means
,
they
went
out
together
to
the
front
door
,
where
Mr
Pecksniff
's
property
stopped
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
drive
,
thank
you
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Martin
,
getting
into
the
sitter
's
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
,
there
's
a
box
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Can
we
manage
to
take
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
it
in
,
Dick
,
anywhere
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
precisely
of
that
convenient
size
which
would
admit
of
its
being
squeezed
into
any
odd
corner
,
but
Dick
the
hostler
got
it
in
somehow
,
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
helped
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
on
Mr
Pinch
's
side
,
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
said
he
was
very
much
afraid
it
would
encumber
him
;
to
which
Tom
said
,
"
Not
at
all
;
"
though
it
forced
him
into
such
an
awkward
position
,
that
he
had
much
ado
to
see
anything
but
his
own
knees
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
;
and
the
wisdom
of
the
saying
was
verified
in
this
instance
;
for
the
cold
air
came
from
Mr
Pinch
's
side
of
the
carriage
,
and
by
interposing
a
perfect
wall
of
box
and
man
between
it
and
the
new
pupil
,
he
shielded
that
young
gentleman
effectually
;
which
was
a
great
comfort
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
clear
evening
,
with
a
bright
moon
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
landscape
was
silvered
by
its
light
and
by
the
hoar
-
frost
;
and
everything
looked
exquisitely
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
the
great
serenity
and
peace
through
which
they
travelled
,
disposed
them
both
to
silence
;
but
in
a
very
short
time
the
punch
within
them
and
the
healthful
air
without
,
made
them
loquacious
,
and
they
talked
incessantly
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
were
halfway
home
,
and
stopped
to
give
the
horse
some
water
,
Martin
(
who
was
very
generous
with
his
money
)
ordered
another
glass
of
punch
,
which
they
drank
between
them
,
and
which
had
not
the
effect
of
making
them
less
conversational
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
Their
principal
topic
of
discourse
was
naturally
Mr
Pecksniff
and
his
family
;
of
whom
,
and
of
the
great
obligations
they
had
heaped
upon
him
,
Tom
Pinch
,
with
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
,
drew
such
a
picture
as
would
have
inclined
any
one
of
common
feeling
almost
to
revere
them
;
and
of
which
Mr
Pecksniff
had
not
the
slightest
foresight
or
preconceived
idea
,
or
he
certainly
(
being
very
humble
)
would
not
have
sent
Tom
Pinch
to
bring
the
pupil
home
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
went
on
,
and
on
,
and
on
---
in
the
language
of
the
story
-
books
---
until
at
last
the
village
lights
appeared
before
them
,
and
the
church
spire
cast
a
long
reflection
on
the
graveyard
grass
;
as
if
it
were
a
dial
(
alas
,
the
truest
in
the
world
!
)
<EOS>
marking
,
whatever
light
shone
out
of
Heaven
,
the
flight
of
days
and
weeks
and
years
,
by
some
new
shadow
on
that
solemn
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
pretty
church
!
<EOS>
"
said
Martin
,
observing
that
his
companion
slackened
the
slack
pace
of
the
horse
,
as
they
approached
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
with
great
pride
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
sweetest
little
organ
there
<EOS>
you
ever
heard
.
 
<EOS>
I
play
it
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
hardly
worth
the
trouble
,
I
should
think
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
get
for
that
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
answered
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
"
you
ARE
a
very
strange
fellow
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
which
remark
there
succeeded
a
brief
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
say
nothing
,
"
observed
Mr
Pinch
,
cheerfully
,
"
I
am
wrong
,
and
do
n't
say
what
I
mean
,
because
I
get
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
from
it
,
and
the
means
of
passing
some
of
the
happiest
hours
I
know
.
<EOS>
It
led
to
something
else
the
other
day
;
but
you
will
not
care
to
hear
about
that
I
dare
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
I
shall
.
 
<EOS>
What
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
led
to
my
seeing
,
"
said
Tom
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
"
one
of
the
loveliest
and
most
beautiful
faces
you
can
possibly
picture
to
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
am
able
to
picture
a
beautiful
one
,
"
said
his
friend
,
thoughtfully
,
"
or
should
be
,
if
I
have
any
memory
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
came
"
said
Tom
,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
other
's
arm
,
"
for
the
first
time
very
early
in
the
morning
,
when
it
was
hardly
light
;
and
when
I
saw
her
,
over
my
shoulder
,
standing
just
within
the
porch
,
I
turned
quite
cold
,
almost
believing
her
to
be
a
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
's
reflection
got
the
better
of
that
,
of
course
,
and
fortunately
it
came
to
my
relief
so
soon
,
that
I
did
n't
leave
off
playing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
fortunately
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
 
<EOS>
Because
she
stood
there
,
listening
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
my
spectacles
on
,
and
saw
her
through
the
chinks
in
the
curtains
as
plainly
as
I
see
you
;
and
she
was
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
she
glided
off
,
and
I
continued
to
play
until
she
was
out
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
do
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
?
"
responded
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
she
might
suppose
I
had
n't
seen
her
;
and
might
return
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
did
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
she
did
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
and
next
evening
too
<EOS>
;
<EOS>
but
always
when
there
were
no
people
about
,
and
always
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
rose
earlier
and
sat
there
later
,
that
when
she
came
,
she
might
find
the
church
door
open
,
and
the
organ
playing
,
and
might
not
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
She
strolled
that
way
for
some
days
,
and
always
stayed
to
listen
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
gone
now
,
and
of
all
unlikely
things
in
this
wide
world
,
it
is
perhaps
the
most
improbable
that
I
shall
ever
look
upon
her
face
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
anything
more
about
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
never
followed
her
when
she
went
away
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
distress
her
by
doing
that
?
"
said
Tom
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
likely
that
she
wanted
my
company
?
 
<EOS>
She
came
to
hear
the
organ
,
not
to
see
me
;
and
would
you
have
had
me
scare
her
from
a
place
she
seemed
to
grow
quite
fond
of
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Heaven
bless
her
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
"
to
have
given
her
but
a
minute
's
pleasure
every
day
,
I
would
have
gone
on
playing
the
organ
at
those
times
until
I
was
an
old
man
;
quite
contented
if
she
sometimes
thought
of
a
poor
fellow
like
me
,
as
a
part
of
the
music
;
and
more
than
recompensed
if
she
ever
mixed
me
up
with
anything
she
liked
as
well
as
she
liked
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
new
pupil
was
clearly
very
much
amazed
by
Mr
Pinch
's
weakness
,
and
would
probably
have
told
him
so
,
and
given
him
some
good
advice
,
but
for
their
opportune
arrival
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
door
;
the
front
door
this
time
,
on
account
of
the
occasion
being
one
of
ceremony
and
rejoicing
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
man
was
in
waiting
for
the
horse
who
had
been
adjured
by
Mr
Pinch
in
the
morning
not
to
yield
to
his
rabid
desire
to
start
;
and
after
delivering
the
animal
into
his
charge
,
and
beseeching
Mr
Chuzzlewit
in
a
whisper
never
to
reveal
a
syllable
of
what
he
had
just
told
him
in
the
fullness
of
his
heart
,
Tom
led
the
pupil
in
,
for
instant
presentation
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
clearly
not
expected
them
for
hours
to
come
;
for
he
was
surrounded
by
open
books
,
and
was
glancing
from
volume
to
volume
,
with
a
black
lead
-
pencil
in
his
mouth
,
and
a
pair
of
compasses
in
his
hand
,
at
a
vast
number
of
mathematical
diagrams
,
of
such
extraordinary
shapes
that
they
looked
like
designs
for
fireworks
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
had
Miss
Charity
expected
them
,
for
she
was
busied
,
with
a
capacious
wicker
basket
before
her
,
in
making
impracticable
nightcaps
for
the
poor
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
had
Miss
Mercy
expected
them
,
for
she
was
sitting
upon
her
stool
,
tying
on
the
---
oh
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
the
petticoat
of
a
large
doll
that
she
was
dressing
for
a
neighbour
's
child
---
really
,
quite
a
grown
-
up
doll
,
which
made
it
more
confusing
---
and
had
its
little
bonnet
dangling
by
the
ribbon
from
one
of
her
fair
curls
,
to
which
she
had
fastened
it
lest
it
should
be
lost
or
sat
upon
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
conceive
a
family
so
thoroughly
taken
by
surprise
as
the
Pecksniffs
were
,
on
this
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Bless
my
life
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
up
,
and
gradually
exchanging
his
abstracted
face
for
one
of
joyful
recognition
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
already
!
 
<EOS>
Martin
,
my
dear
boy
,
I
am
delighted
to
welcome
you
to
my
poor
house
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
kind
greeting
,
Mr
Pecksniff
fairly
took
him
to
his
arms
,
and
patted
him
several
times
upon
the
back
with
his
right
hand
the
while
,
as
if
to
express
that
his
feelings
during
the
embrace
were
too
much
for
utterance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
here
,
"
he
said
,
recovering
,
"
are
my
daughters
,
Martin
;
my
two
only
children
,
whom
(
if
you
ever
saw
them
)
you
have
not
beheld
---
ah
,
these
sad
family
divisions
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
since
you
were
infants
together
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
my
dears
,
why
blush
at
being
detected
in
your
everyday
pursuits
?
 
<EOS>
We
had
prepared
to
give
you
the
reception
of
a
visitor
,
Martin
,
in
our
little
room
of
state
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
smiling
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
like
this
better
,
I
like
this
better
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
blessed
star
of
Innocence
,
wherever
you
may
be
,
how
did
you
glitter
in
your
home
of
ether
,
when
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
put
forth
each
her
lily
hand
,
and
gave
the
same
,
with
mantling
cheeks
,
to
Martin
!
 
<EOS>
How
did
you
twinkle
,
as
if
fluttering
with
sympathy
,
when
Mercy
,
reminded
of
the
bonnet
in
her
hair
,
hid
her
fair
face
and
turned
her
head
aside
;
<EOS>
the
while
her
gentle
sister
plucked
it
out
,
and
smote
her
with
a
sister
's
soft
reproof
,
upon
her
buxom
shoulder
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
turning
round
after
the
contemplation
of
these
passages
,
and
taking
Mr
Pinch
in
a
friendly
manner
by
the
elbow
,
"
how
has
our
friend
used
you
,
Martin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
indeed
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
on
the
best
terms
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Tom
Pinch
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
on
him
with
affectionate
sadness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
It
seems
but
yesterday
that
Thomas
was
a
boy
fresh
from
a
scholastic
course
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
years
have
passed
,
I
think
,
since
Thomas
Pinch
and
I
first
walked
the
world
together
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
could
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
too
much
moved
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
pressed
his
master
's
hand
,
and
tried
to
thank
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Thomas
Pinch
and
I
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
a
deeper
voice
,
"
will
walk
it
yet
,
in
mutual
faithfulness
and
friendship
!
 
<EOS>
And
if
it
comes
to
pass
that
either
of
us
be
run
over
in
any
of
those
busy
crossings
which
divide
the
streets
of
life
,
the
other
will
convey
him
to
the
hospital
in
Hope
,
and
sit
beside
his
bed
in
Bounty
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
well
!
"
he
added
in
a
happier
tone
,
as
he
shook
Mr
Pinch
's
elbow
hard
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
!
 
<EOS>
Martin
,
my
dear
friend
,
that
you
may
be
at
home
within
these
walls
,
let
me
show
you
how
we
live
,
and
where
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
took
up
a
lighted
candle
,
and
,
attended
by
his
young
relative
,
prepared
to
leave
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
door
,
he
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
bear
us
company
,
Tom
Pinch
?
"
   
<EOS>
Aye
,
cheerfully
,
though
it
had
been
to
death
,
would
Tom
have
followed
him
;
glad
to
lay
down
his
life
for
such
a
man
!
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
opening
the
door
of
an
opposite
parlour
,
"
is
the
little
room
of
state
,
I
mentioned
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
girls
have
pride
in
it
,
Martin
!
 
<EOS>
This
,
"
opening
another
door
,
"
is
the
little
chamber
in
which
my
works
(
slight
things
at
best
)
have
been
concocted
.
 
<EOS>
Portrait
of
myself
by
Spiller
.
 
<EOS>
Bust
by
Spoker
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
is
considered
a
good
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
recognize
something
about
the
left
-
hand
corner
of
the
nose
,
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
thought
it
was
very
like
,
but
scarcely
intellectual
enough
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
observed
that
the
same
fault
had
been
found
with
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
it
should
have
struck
his
young
relation
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
glad
to
see
he
had
an
eye
for
art
.
   
<EOS>
"
Various
books
you
observe
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
waving
his
hand
towards
the
wall
,
"
connected
with
our
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
scribbled
myself
,
but
have
not
yet
published
.
 
<EOS>
Be
careful
how
you
come
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
"
opening
another
door
<EOS>
,
"
is
my
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
here
when
the
family
suppose
I
have
retired
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
injure
my
health
rather
more
than
I
can
quite
justify
to
myself
,
by
doing
so
;
but
art
is
long
and
time
is
short
.
 
<EOS>
Every
facility
you
see
for
jotting
down
crude
notions
,
even
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
latter
words
were
explained
by
his
pointing
to
a
small
round
table
on
which
were
a
lamp
,
divers
sheets
of
paper
,
a
piece
of
India
rubber
,
and
a
case
of
instruments
;
all
put
ready
,
in
case
an
architectural
idea
should
come
into
Mr
Pecksniff
's
head
in
the
night
;
in
which
event
he
would
instantly
leap
out
of
bed
,
and
fix
it
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
opened
another
door
on
the
same
floor
,
and
shut
it
again
,
all
at
once
,
as
if
it
were
a
Blue
Chamber
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
he
had
well
done
so
,
he
looked
smilingly
round
,
and
said
,
"
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
could
n't
say
why
not
,
because
he
did
n't
know
anything
at
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Pecksniff
answered
himself
,
by
throwing
open
the
door
,
and
saying
:
   
"
My
daughters
'
room
.
 
<EOS>
A
poor
first
-
floor
to
us
,
but
a
bower
to
them
.
<EOS>
Very
neat
.
 
<EOS>
Very
airy
.
 
<EOS>
Plants
you
observe
;
hyacinths
<EOS>
;
books
again
;
birds
.
"
 
<EOS>
These
birds
,
by
the
bye
,
comprised
,
in
all
,
one
staggering
old
sparrow
without
a
tail
,
which
had
been
borrowed
expressly
from
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
trifles
as
girls
love
are
here
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Those
who
seek
heartless
splendour
,
would
seek
here
in
vain
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
led
them
to
the
floor
above
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
throwing

occurred
to
me

fully
assented

what
is
more

fully

said
Mr

,
passing

added
,
having
by
this
time
reached
another
large
chamber
on
the

story
,
with
four
little
beds
in
it
,
"
this

<EOS>
my

Martin
,
there
is
no

on

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
undoubtedly
true
,
and
may
be
stated
in
corroboration
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
that
any
pupil
had
the
most
liberal
permission
to
mention
anything
in
this
way
that
suggested
itself
to
his
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
Some
young
gentlemen
had
gone
on
mentioning
the
very
same
thing
for
five
years
without
ever
being
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
domestic
assistants
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
sleep
above
;
and
that
is
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
and
listening
complacently
as
he
went
,
to
the
encomiums
passed
by
his
young
friend
on
the
arrangements
generally
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
parlour
again
.
   
<EOS>
Here
a
great
change
had
taken
place
;
for
festive
preparations
on
a
rather
extensive
scale
were
already
completed
,
and
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
were
awaiting
their
return
with
hospitable
looks
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
bottles
of
currant
wine
,
white
and
red
;
a
dish
of
sandwiches
(
very
long
and
very
slim
)
;
another
of
apples
;
another
of
captain
's
biscuits
(
which
are
always
a
moist
and
jovial
sort
of
viand
)
;
a
plate
of
oranges
cut
up
small
and
gritty
;
with
powdered
sugar
,
and
a
highly
geological
home
-
made
cake
.
 
<EOS>
The
magnitude
of
these
preparations
quite
took
away
Tom
Pinch
's
breath
;
for
though
the
new
pupils
were
usually
let
down
softly
,
as
one
may
say
,
particularly
in
the
wine
department
,
which
had
so
many
stages
of
declension
,
that
sometimes
a
young
gentleman
was
a
whole
fortnight
in
getting
to
the
pump
;
still
this
was
a
banquet
;
a
sort
of
Lord
Mayor
's
feast
in
private
life
;
a
something
to
think
of
,
and
hold
on
by
,
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
entertainment
,
which
apart
from
its
own
intrinsic
merits
,
had
the
additional
choice
quality
,
that
it
was
in
strict
keeping
with
the
night
,
being
both
light
and
cool
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pecksniff
besought
the
company
to
do
full
justice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martin
,
"
he
said
,
"
will
seat
himself
between
you
two
,
my
dears
,
and
Mr
Pinch
will
come
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
drink
to
our
new
inmate
,
and
may
we
be
happy
together
!
 
<EOS>
Martin
,
my
dear
friend
,
my
love
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
if
you
spare
the
bottle
we
shall
quarrel
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
trying
(
in
his
regard
for
the
feelings
of
the
rest
)
to
look
as
if
the
wine
were
not
acid
and
did
n't
make
him
wink
,
Mr
Pecksniff
did
honour
to
his
own
toast
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
he
said
,
in
allusion
to
the
party
,
not
the
wine
,
"
is
a
mingling
that
repays
one
for
much
disappointment
and
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
be
merry
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
he
took
a
captain
's
biscuit
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
poor
heart
that
never
rejoices
;
and
our
hearts
are
not
poor
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
such
stimulants
to
merriment
did
he
beguile
the
time
,
and
do
the
honours
of
the
table
;
while
Mr
Pinch
,
perhaps
to
assure
himself
that
what
he
saw
and
heard
was
holiday
reality
,
and
not
a
charming
dream
,
ate
of
everything
,
and
in
particular
disposed
of
the
slim
sandwiches
to
a
surprising
extent
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
stinted
in
his
draughts
of
wine
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
remembering
Mr
Pecksniff
's
speech
,
attacked
the
bottle
with
such
vigour
,
that
every
time
he
filled
his
glass
anew
,
Miss
Charity
,
despite
her
amiable
resolves
,
could
not
repress
a
fixed
and
stony
glare
,
as
if
her
eyes
had
rested
on
a
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
also
became
thoughtful
at
those
moments
,
not
to
say
dejected
;
but
as
he
knew
the
vintage
,
it
is
very
likely
he
may
have
been
speculating
on
the
probable
condition
of
Mr
Pinch
upon
the
morrow
,
and
discussing
within
himself
the
best
remedies
for
colic
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
and
the
young
ladies
were
excellent
friends
already
,
and
compared
recollections
of
their
childish
days
,
to
their
mutual
liveliness
and
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mercy
laughed
immensely
at
everything
that
was
said
;
and
sometimes
,
after
glancing
at
the
happy
face
of
Mr
Pinch
,
was
seized
with
such
fits
of
mirth
as
brought
her
to
the
very
confines
of
hysterics
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
these
bursts
of
gaiety
,
her
sister
,
in
her
better
sense
,
reproved
her
;
observing
,
in
an
angry
whisper
,
that
it
was
far
from
being
a
theme
for
jest
;
and
that
she
had
no
patience
with
the
creature
;
though
it
generally
ended
in
her
laughing
too
---
but
much
more
moderately
---
and
saying
that
indeed
it
was
a
little
too
ridiculous
and
intolerable
to
be
serious
about
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
it
became
high
time
to
remember
the
first
clause
of
that
great
discovery
made
by
the
ancient
philosopher
,
for
securing
health
,
riches
,
and
wisdom
;
the
infallibility
of
which
has
been
for
generations
verified
by
the
enormous
fortunes
constantly
amassed
by
chimney
-
sweepers
and
other
persons
who
get
up
early
and
go
to
bed
betimes
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
accordingly
rose
,
and
having
taken
leave
of
Mr
Chuzzlewit
with
much
sweetness
,
and
of
their
father
with
much
duty
and
of
Mr
Pinch
with
much
condescension
,
retired
to
their
bower
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
insisted
on
accompanying
his
young
friend
upstairs
for
personal
superintendence
of
his
comforts
;
and
taking
him
by
the
arm
,
conducted
him
once
more
to
his
bedroom
,
followed
by
Mr
Pinch
,
who
bore
the
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
seating
himself
with
folded
arms
on
one
of
the
spare
beds
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
any
snuffers
in
that
candlestick
.
<EOS>
Will
you
oblige
me
by
going
down
,
and
asking
for
a
pair
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
only
too
happy
to
be
useful
,
went
off
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
Thomas
Pinch
's
want
of
polish
,
Martin
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
smile
of
patronage
and
pity
,
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
means
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
very
good
fellow
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
Pinch
means
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
very
grateful
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
regretted
having
befriended
Thomas
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
never
would
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
I
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
,
he
is
always
disposed
to
do
his
best
;
but
he
is
not
gifted
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
make
him
useful
to
you
,
Martin
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
If
Thomas
has
a
fault
,
it
is
that
he
is
sometimes
a
little
apt
to
forget
his
position
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
is
soon
checked
.
 
<EOS>
Worthy
soul
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
find
him
easy
to
manage
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
Mr
Pinch
had
returned
with
the
snuffers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
good
night
to
YOU
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
sound
sleep
to
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Invoking
this
benediction
on
the
heads
of
his
young
friends
with
great
fervour
,
he
withdrew
to
his
own
room
;
while
they
,
being
tired
,
soon
fell
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
If
Martin
dreamed
at
all
,
some
clue
to
the
matter
of
his
visions
may
possibly
be
gathered
from
the
after
-
pages
of
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
Those
of
Thomas
Pinch
were
all
of
holidays
,
church
organs
,
and
seraphic
Pecksniffs
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
Mr
Pecksniff
dreamed
at
all
,
or
even
sought
his
pillow
,
as
he
sat
for
full
two
hours
before
the
fire
in
his
own
chamber
,
looking
at
the
coals
and
thinking
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
,
too
,
slept
and
dreamed
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
in
the
quiet
hours
of
the
night
,
one
house
shuts
in
as
many
incoherent
and
incongruous
fancies
as
a
madman
's
head
.

Comprises
,
among
other
important
matters
,
Pecksniffian
and
achitectural
,
and
exact
relation
of
the
progress
made
by
Mr
Pinch
in
the
confidence
and
friendship
of
the
new
pupil
 
<EOS>
It
was
morning
;
and
the
beautiful
Aurora
,
of
whom
so
much
hath
been
written
,
said
,
and
sung
,
did
,
with
her
rosy
fingers
,
nip
and
tweak
Miss
Pecksniff
's
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
frolicsome
custom
of
the
Goddess
,
in
her
intercourse
with
the
fair
Cherry
,
so
to
do
;
or
in
more
prosaic
phrase
,
the
tip
of
that
feature
in
the
sweet
girl
's
countenance
was
always
very
red
at
breakfast
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
most
part
,
indeed
,
it
wore
,
at
that
season
of
the
day
,
a
scraped
and
frosty
look
,
as
if
it
had
been
rasped
;
while
a
similar
phenomenon
developed
itself
in
her
humour
,
which
was
then
observed
to
be
of
a
sharp
and
acid
quality
,
as
though
an
extra
lemon
(
figuratively
speaking
)
had
been
squeezed
into
the
nectar
of
her
disposition
,
and
had
rather
damaged
its
flavour
.
   
<EOS>
This
additional
pungency
on
the
part
of
the
fair
young
creature
led
,
on
ordinary
occasions
,
to
such
slight
consequences
as
the
copious
dilution
of
Mr
Pinch
's
tea
,
or
to
his
coming
off
uncommonly
short
in
respect
of
butter
,
or
to
other
the
like
results
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
the
morning
after
the
Installation
Banquet
,
she
suffered
him
to
wander
to
and
fro
among
the
eatables
and
drinkables
,
a
perfectly
free
and
unchecked
man
;
so
utterly
to
Mr
Pinch
's
wonder
and
confusion
,
that
like
the
wretched
captive
who
recovered
his
liberty
in
his
old
age
,
he
could
make
but
<EOS>
little
use
of
his
enlargement
,
and
fell
into
a
strange
kind
of
flutter
for
want
of
some
kind
hand
to
scrape
his
bread
,
and
cut
him
off
in
the
article
of
sugar
with
a
lump
,
and
pay
him
those
other
little
attentions
to
which
he
was
accustomed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
almost
awful
,
too
,
about
the
self
-
possession
of
the
new
pupil
;
who
"
troubled
"
Mr
Pecksniff
for
the
loaf
,
and
helped
himself
to
a
rasher
of
that
gentleman
's
own
particular
and
private
bacon
,
with
all
the
coolness
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
seemed
to
think
that
he
was
doing
quite
a
regular
thing
,
and
to
expect
that
Mr
Pinch
would
follow
his
example
,
since
he
took
occasion
to
observe
of
that
young
man
"
that
he
did
n't
get
on
"
;
a
speech
of
so
tremendous
a
character
,
that
Tom
cast
down
his
eyes
involuntarily
,
and
felt
as
if
he
himself
had
committed
some
horrible
deed
and
heinous
breach
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
agony
of
having
such
an
indiscreet
remark
addressed
to
him
before
the
assembled
family
,
was
breakfast
enough
in
itself
,
and
would
,
without
any
other
matter
of
reflection
,
have
settled
Mr
Pinch
's
business
and
quenched
his
appetite
,
for
one
meal
,
though
he
had
been
never
so
hungry
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
,
however
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
likewise
,
remained
in
the
very
best
of
spirits
in
spite
of
these
severe
trials
,
though
with
something
of
a
mysterious
understanding
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
meal
was
nearly
over
,
Mr
Pecksniff
smilingly
explained
the
cause
of
their
common
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
often
,
"
he
said
,
"
Martin
,
that
my
daughters
and
I
desert
our
quiet
home
to
pursue
the
giddy
round
of
pleasures
that
revolves
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
think
of
doing
so
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
!
"
cried
the
new
pupil
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
tapping
his
left
hand
with
a
letter
which
he
held
in
his
right
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
summons
here
to
repair
to
London

on
professional
business

my
dear
Martin

strictly

professional
business
;
and
I
promised
my
girls
,
long
ago
,
that
whenever
that
happened
again
,
they
should
accompany
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
go
forth
to
-
night
by
the
heavy
coach
---
like
the
dove
of
old
,
my
dear
Martin
---
and
it
will
be
a
week
before
we
again
deposit
our
olive
-
branches
in
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
say
olive
-
branches
,
"
observed
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
explanation
,
"
I
mean
,
our
unpretending
luggage
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
the
young
ladies
will
enjoy
their
trip
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
'm
sure
we
shall
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mercy
,
clapping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
gracious
,
Cherry
,
my
darling
,
the
idea
of
London
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ardent
child
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
gazing
on
her
in
a
dreamy
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
there
is
a
melancholy
sweetness
in
these
youthful
hopes
!
<EOS>
It
is
pleasant
to
know
that
they
never
can
be
realised
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
thinking
once
myself
,
in
the
days
of
my
childhood
,
that
pickled
onions
grew
on
trees
,
and
that
every
elephant
was
born
with
an
impregnable
castle
on
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
found
the
fact
to
be
so
;
far
from
it
;
and
yet
those
visions
have
comforted
me
under
circumstances
of
trial
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
I
have
had
the
anguish
of
discovering
that
I
have
nourished
in
my
breast
on
ostrich
,
and
not
a
human
pupil
---
even
in
that
hour
of
agony
,
they
have
soothed
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
dread
allusion
to
John
Westlock
,
Mr
Pinch
precipitately
choked
in
his
tea
;
for
he
had
<EOS>
that
very
morning
received
a
letter
from
him
,
as
Mr
Pecksniff
very
well
knew
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
care
,
my
dear
Martin
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
resuming
his
former
cheerfulness
,
"
that
the
house
does
not
run
away
in
our
absence
.
 
<EOS>
We
leave
you
in
charge
of
everything
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
mystery
;
all
is
free
and
open
.
 
<EOS>
Unlike
the
young
man
in
the
Eastern
tale
---
who
is
described
as
a
one
-
eyed
almanac
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
Mr
Pinch
?
---
"
   
"
A
one
-
eyed
calender
,
I
think
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
faltered
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
pretty
nearly
the
same
thing
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
smiling
compassionately
;
"
or
they
used
to
be
in
my
time
.
<EOS>
Unlike
that
young
man
,
my
dear
Martin
,
you
are
forbidden
to
enter
no
corner
of
this
house
;
but
are
requested
to
make
yourself
perfectly
at
home
in
every
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
jovial
,
my
dear
Martin
,
and
will
kill
the
fatted
calf
if
you
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
least
objection
,
doubtless
,
to
the
young
man
's
slaughtering
and
appropriating
to
his
own
use
any
calf
,
fat
or
lean
,
that
he
might
happen
to
find
upon
the
premises
;
but
as
no
such
animal
chanced
at
that
time
to
be
grazing
on
Mr
Pecksniff
's
estate
,
this
request
must
be
considered
rather
as
a
polite
compliment
that
a
substantial
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
finishing
ornament
of
the
conversation
;
for
when
he
had
delivered
it
,
Mr
Pecksniff
rose
and
led
the
way
to
that
hotbed
of
architectural
genius
,
the
two
-
pair
front
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
"
he
said
,
searching
among
the
papers
,
"
how
you
can
best
employ
yourself
,
Martin
,
while
I
am
absent
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
you
were
to
give
me
your
idea
of
a
monument
to
a
Lord
Mayor
of
London
;
or
a
tomb
for
a
sheriff
;
or
your
notion
of
a
cow
-
house
to
be
erected
in
a
nobleman
's
park
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
folding
his
hands
,
and
looking
at
his
young
relation
with
an
air
of
pensive
interest
,
"
that
I
should
very
much
like
to
see
your
notion
of
a
cow
-
house
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
Martin
by
no
means
appeared
to
relish
this
suggestion
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
pump
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
is
very
chaste
practice
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
found
that
a
lamp
post
is
calculated
to
refine
the
mind
and
give
it
a
classical
tendency
.
 
<EOS>
An
ornamental
turnpike
has
a
remarkable
effect
upon
the
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
beginning
with
an
ornamental
turnpike
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whatever
Mr
Pecksniff
pleased
,
"
said
Martin
,
doubtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
"
said
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
as
you
're
ambitious
,
and
are
a
very
neat
draughtsman
,
you
shall
---
ha
ha
!
<EOS>
---
you
shall
try
your
hand
on
these
proposals
for
a
grammar
-
school
;
regulating
your
plan
,
of
course
,
by
the
printed
particulars
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
merrily
,
"
I
shall
be
very
curious
to
see
what
you
make
of
the
grammar
-
school
.
 
<EOS>
Who
knows
but
a
young
man
of
your
taste
might
hit
upon
something
,
impracticable
and
unlikely
in
itself
,
but
which
I
could
put
into
shape
?
 
<EOS>
For
it
really
is
,
my
dear
Martin
<EOS>
,
it
really
is
in
the
finishing
touches
alone
,
that
great
experience
and
long
study
in
these
matters
tell
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Now
it
really
will
be
,
"
continued
Mr
Pecksniff
,
clapping
his
young
friend
on
the
back
in
his
droll
humour
,
"
an
amusement
to
me
,
to
see
what
you
make
of
the
grammar
-
school
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
readily
undertook
this
task
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
forthwith
proceeded
to
entrust
him
with
the
materials
necessary
for
its
execution
;
dwelling
meanwhile
on
the
magical
effect
of
a
few
finishing
touches
from
the
hand
of
a
master
;
which
,
indeed
,
as
some
people
said
(
and
these
were
the
old
enemies
again
!
)
was
unquestionably
very
surprising
,
and
almost
miraculous
;
as
there
were
cases
on
record
in
which
the
masterly
introduction
of
an
additional
back
window
,
or
a
kitchen
door
,
or
half
-
a
-
dozen
steps
,
or
even
a
water
spout
,
had
made
the
design
of
a
pupil
Mr
Pecksniff
's
own
work
,
and
had
brought
substantial
rewards
into
that
gentleman
's
pocket
.
<EOS>
But
such
is
the
magic
of
genius
,
which
changes
all
it
handles
into
gold
!
   
<EOS>
"
When
your
mind
requires
to
be
refreshed
by
change
of
occupation
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
Thomas
Pinch
will
instruct
you
in
the
art
of
surveying
the
back
garden
,
or
in
ascertaining
the
dead
level
of
the
road
between
this
house
and
the
finger
-
post
,
or
in
any
other
practical
and
pleasing
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
a
cart
-
load
of
loose
bricks
,
and
a
score
or
two
of
old
flower
-
pots
,
in
the
back
yard
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
could
pile
them
up
my
dear
Martin
,
into
any
form
which
would
remind
me
on
my
return
say
of
St.
Peter
's
at
Rome
,
or
the
Mosque
of
St.
Sophia
at
Constantinople
,
it
would
be
at
once
improving
to
you
and
agreeable
to
my
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
conclusion
,
"
to
drop
,
for
the
present
,
our
professional
relations
and
advert
to
private
matters
<EOS>
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
talk
with
you
in
my
own
room
,
while
I
pack
up
my
portmanteau
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
attended
him
;
and
they
remained
in
secret
conference
together
for
an
hour
or
more
;
leaving
Tom
Pinch
alone
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
young
man
returned
,
he
was
very
taciturn
and
dull
,
in
which
state
he
remained
all
day
;
so
that
Tom
,
after
trying
him
once
or
twice
with
indifferent
conversation
,
felt
a
delicacy
in
obtruding
himself
upon
his
thoughts
,
and
said
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
had
leisure
to
say
much
,
had
his
new
friend
been
ever
so
loquacious
;
for
first
of
all
Mr
Pecksniff
called
him
down
to
stand
upon
the
top
of
his
portmanteau
and
represent
ancient
statues
there
,
until
such
time
as
it
would
consent
to
be
locked
;
and
then
Miss
Charity
called
him
to
come
and
cord
her
trunk
;
and
then
Miss
Mercy
sent
for
him
to
come
and
mend
her
box
;
and
then
he
wrote
the
fullest
possible
cards
for
all
the
luggage
;
and
then
he
volunteered
to
carry
it
all
downstairs
;
and
after
that
to
see
it
safely
carried
on
a
couple
of
barrows
to
the
old
finger
-
post
at
the
end
of
the
lane
;
and
then
to
mind
it
till
the
coach
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
his
day
's
work
would
have
been
a
pretty
heavy
one
for
a
porter
,
but
his
thorough
good
-
will
made
nothing
of
it
;
and
as
he
sat
upon
the
luggage
at
last
,
waiting
for
the
Pecksniffs
,
escorted
by
the
new
pupil
,
to
come
down
the
lane
,
his
heart
was
light
with
the
hope
of
having
pleased
his
benefactor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
almost
afraid
,
"
said
Tom
,
taking
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
wiping
his
face
,
for
he
was
hot
with
bustling
about
though
it
was
a
cold
day
,
"
that
I
should
n't
have
had
time
to
write
it
,
and
that
would
have
been
a
thousand
pities
;
postage
from
such
a
distance
being
a
serious
consideration
,
when
one
's
not
rich
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
glad
to
see
my
hand
,
poor
girl
,
and
to
hear
that
Pecksniff
is
as
kind
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
asked
John
Westlock
to
call
and
see
her
,
and
tell
her
all
about
me
by
word
of
mouth
,
but
I
was
afraid
he
might
speak
against
Pecksniff
to
her
,
and
make
her
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
they
are
particular
people
where
she
is
,
and
it
might
have
rendered
her
situation
uncomfortable
if
she
had
had
a
visit
from
a
young
man
like
John
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Ruth
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
seemed
a
little
disposed
to
be
melancholy
for
half
a
minute
or
so
,
but
he
found
comfort
very
soon
,
and
pursued
his
ruminations
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
nice
man
,
I
do
n't
think
,
as
John
used
to
say
(
John
was
a
kind
,
merry
-
hearted
fellow
;
I
wish
he
had
liked
Pecksniff
better
)
,
to
be
feeling
low
,
on
account
of
the
distance
between
us
,
when
I
ought
to
be
thinking
,
instead
,
of
my
extraordinary
good
luck
in
having
ever
got
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
been
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
my
mouth
,
I
am
sure
,
to
have
ever
come
across
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
have
I
fallen
again
into
my
usual
good
luck
with
the
new
pupil
!
 
<EOS>
Such
an
affable
,
generous
,
free
fellow
,
as
he
is
,
I
never
saw
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
we
were
companions
directly
!
<EOS>
and
he
a
relation
of
Pecksniff
's
too
,
and
a
clever
,
dashing
youth
who
might
cut
his
way
through
the
world
as
if
it
were
a
cheese
!
 
<EOS>
Here
he
comes
while
the
words
are
on
my
lips
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
;
"
walking
down
the
lane
as
if
the
lane
belonged
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
truth
,
the
new
pupil
,
not
at
all
disconcerted
by
the
honour
of
having
Miss
Mercy
Pecksniff
on
his
arm
,
or
by
the
affectionate
adieux
of
that
young
lady
,
approached
as
Mr
Pinch
spoke
,
followed
by
Miss
Charity
and
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
coach
appeared
at
the
same
moment
,
Tom
lost
no
time
in
entreating
the
gentleman
last
mentioned
,
to
undertake
the
delivery
of
his
letter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
glancing
at
the
superscription
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
your
sister
,
Thomas
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
oh
yes
,
it
shall
be
delivered
,
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
Make
your
mind
easy
upon
that
score
.
 
<EOS>
She
shall
certainly
have
it
,
Mr
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
made
the
promise
with
so
much
condescension
and
patronage
,
that
Tom
felt
he
had
asked
a
great
deal
<EOS>
(
this
had
not
occurred
to
his
mind
before
)
,
and
thanked
him
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
The
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
according
to
a
custom
they
had
,
were
amused
beyond
description
at
the
mention
of
Mr
Pinch
's
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
the
fright
!
 
<EOS>
The
bare
idea
of
a
Miss
Pinch
!
 
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
greatly
pleased
to
see
them
so
merry
,
for
he
took
it
as
a
token
of
their
favour
,
and
good
-
humoured
regard
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
he
laughed
too
and
rubbed
his
hands
and
wished
them
a
pleasant
journey
and
safe
return
,
and
was
quite
brisk
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
the
coach
had
rolled
away
with
the
olive
-
branches
in
the
boot
and
the
family
of
doves
inside
,
he
stood
waving
his
hand
and
bowing
;
so
much
gratified
by
the
unusually
courteous
demeanour
of
the
young
ladies
,
that
he
was
quite
regardless
,
for
the
moment
,
of
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
who
stood
leaning
thoughtfully
against
the
finger
-
post
,
and
who
after
disposing
of
his
fair
charge
had
hardly
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
The
perfect
silence
which
ensued
upon
the
bustle
and
departure
of
the
coach
,
together
with
the
sharp
air
of
the
wintry
afternoon
,
roused
them
both
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
turned
,
as
by
mutual
consent
,
and
moved
off
arm
-
in
-
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
melancholy
you
are
!
"
said
Tom
;
"
what
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
worth
speaking
of
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
little
more
than
was
the
matter
yesterday
,
and
much
more
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
than
will
be
the
matter
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
out
of
spirits
,
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
cried
Tom
,
"
now
do
you
know
I
am
in
capital
spirits
today
,
and
scarcely
ever
felt
more
disposed
to
be
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
kind
thing
in
your
predecessor
,
John
,
to
write
to
me
,
was
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
Martin
carelessly
;
"
I
should
have
thought
he
would
have
had
enough
to
do
to
enjoy
himself
,
without
thinking
of
you
,
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
what
I
felt
to
be
so
very
likely
,
"
Tom
rejoined
;
"
but
no
,
he
keeps
his
word
,
and
says
,
"
My
dear
Pinch
,
I
often
think
of
you
,
"
and
all
sorts
of
kind
and
considerate
things
of
that
description
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
a
devilish
good
-
natured
fellow
,
"
said
Martin
,
somewhat
peevishly
:
"
because
he
ca
n't
mean
that
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
he
can
,
eh
?
"
said
Tom
,
looking
wistfully
in
his
companion
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
says
so
to
please
me
,
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
is
it
likely
,
"
rejoined
Martin
,
with
greater
earnestness
,
"
that
a
young
man
newly
escaped
from
this
kennel
of
a
place
,
and
fresh
to
all
the
delights
of
being
his
own
master
in
London
,
can
have
much
leisure
or
inclination
to
think
favourably
of
anything
or
anybody
he
has
left
behind
him
here
?
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
to
you
,
<EOS>
Pinch
,
is
it
natural
?
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
short
reflection
,
Mr
Pinch
replied
,
in
a
more
subdued
tone
,
that
to
be
sure
it
was
unreasonable
to
expect
any
such
thing
,
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
Martin
knew
best
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
I
know
best
,
"
Martin
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
feel
that
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
mildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
said
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
had
made
this
rejoinder
,
they
fell
into
a
blank
silence
again
,
which
lasted
until
they
reached
home
;
by
which
time
it
was
dark
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Miss
Charity
Pecksniff
,
in
consideration
of
the
inconvenience
of
carrying
them
with
her
in
the
coach
,
and
the
impossibility
of
preserving
them
by
artificial
means
until
the
family
's
return
,
had
set
forth
,
in
a
couple
of
plates
,
the
fragments
of
yesterday
's
feast
.
 
<EOS>
In
virtue
of
which
liberal
arrangement
,
they
had
the
happiness
to
find
awaiting
them
in
the
parlour
two
chaotic
heaps
of
the
remains
of
last
night
's
pleasure
,
consisting
of
certain
filmy
bits
of
oranges
,
some
mummied
sandwiches
,
various
disrupted
masses
of
the
geological
cake
,
and
several
entire
captain
's
biscuits
.
 
<EOS>
That
choice
liquor
in
which
to
steep
these
dainties
might
not
be
wanting
,
the
remains
of
the
two
bottles
of
currant
wine
had
been
poured
together
and
corked
with
a
curl
-
paper
;
so
that
every
material
was
at
hand
for
making
quite
a
heavy
night
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
Chuzzlewit
beheld
these
roystering
preparations
with
infinite
contempt
,
and
stirring
the
fire
into
a
blaze
(
to
the
great
destruction
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
coals
)
,
sat
moodily
down
before
it
,
in
the
most
comfortable
chair
he
could
find
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
might
the
better
squeeze
himself
into
the
small
corner
that
was
left
for
him
,
Mr
Pinch
took
up
his
position
on
Miss
Mercy
Pecksniff
's
stool
,
and
setting
his
glass
down
upon
the
hearthrug
and
putting
his
plate
upon
his
knees
,
began
to
enjoy
himself
.
   
<EOS>
If
Diogenes
coming
to
life
again
could
have
rolled
himself
,
tub
and
all
,
into
Mr
Pecksniff
's
parlour
and
could
have
seen
Tom
Pinch
as
he
sat
on
Mercy
Pecksniff
's
stool
with
his
plate
and
glass
before
him
he
could
not
have
faced
it
out
,
though
in
his
surliest
mood
,
but
must
have
smiled
good
-
temperedly
.
 
<EOS>
The
perfect
and
entire
satisfaction
of
Tom
;
his
surpassing
appreciation
of
the
husky
sandwiches
,
which
crumbled
in
his
mouth
like
saw
-
dust
;
the
unspeakable
relish
with
which
he
swallowed
the
thin
wine
by
drops
,
and
smacked
his
lips
,
as
though
it
were
so
rich
and
generous
that
to
lose
an
atom
of
its
fruity
flavour
were
a
sin
;
the
look
with
which
he
paused
sometimes
,
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
,
proposing
silent
toasts
to
himself
;
and
the
anxious
shade
that
came
upon
his
contented
face
when
,
after
wandering
round
the
room
,
exulting
in
its
uninvaded
snugness
,
his
glance
encountered
the
dull
brow
of
his
companion
;
no
cynic
in
the
world
,
though
in
his
hatred
of
its
men
a
very
griffin
,
could
have
withstood
these
things
in
Thomas
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
Some
men
would
have
slapped
him
on
the
back
,
and
pledged
him
in
a
bumper
of
the
currant
wine
,
though
it
had
been
the
sharpest
vinegar
 
---
aye
,
and
liked
its
flavour
too
;
some
would
have
seized
him
by
his
honest
hand
,
and
thanked
him
for
the
lesson
that
his
simple
nature
taught
them
.
 
<EOS>
Some
would
have
laughed
with
,
and
others
would
have
laughed
at
him
;
of
which
last
class
was
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
who
,
unable
to
restrain
himself
,
at
last
laughed
loud
and
long
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
said
Tom
,
nodding
approvingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
capital
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
which
encouragement
young
Martin
laughed
again
;
and
said
,
as
soon
as
he
had
breath
and
gravity
enough
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
such
a
fellow
as
you
are
,
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
though
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
's
very
likely
you
do
find
me
strange
,
because
I
have
hardly
seen
anything
of
the
world
,
and
you
have
seen
a
good
deal
I
dare
<EOS>
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
for
my
time
of
life
,
"
rejoined
Martin
,
drawing
his
chair
still
nearer
to
the
fire
,
and
spreading
his
feet
out
on
the
fender
.
 
<EOS>
"
Deuce
take
it
,
I
must
talk
openly
to
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
talk
openly
to
you
,
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
it
as
being
very
friendly
of
you
,
"
   
"
I
'm
not
in
your
way
,
am
I
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Martin
,
glancing
down
at
Mr
Pinch
,
who
was
by
this
time
looking
at
the
fire
over
his
leg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
!
"
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
then
,
to
make
short
of
a
long
story
,
"
said
Martin
,
beginning
with
a
kind
of
effort
,
as
if
the
revelation
were
not
agreeable
to
him
;
"
that
I
have
been
bred
up
from
childhood
with
great
expectations
,
and
have
always
been
taught
to
believe
that
I
should
be
,
one
day
,
very
rich
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
should
have
been
,
but
for
certain
brief
reasons
which
I
am
going
to
tell
you
,
and
which
have
led
to
my
being
disinherited
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
your
father
?
"
inquired
Mr
Pinch
,
with
open
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
my
grandfather
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
no
parents
these
many
years
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
within
my
remembrance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Neither
have
I
,
"
said
Tom
,
touching
the
young
man
's
hand
with
his
own
and
timidly
withdrawing
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
as
to
that
,
you
know
,
Pinch
,
"
pursued
the
other
,
stirring
the
fire
again
,
and
speaking
in
his
rapid
,
off
-
hand
way
;
"
it
's
all
very
right
and
proper
to
be
fond
of
parents
when
we
have
them
,
and
to
bear
them
in
remembrance
after
they
're
dead
,
if
you
have
ever
known
anything
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
I
never
did
know
anything
about
mine
personally
,
you
know
,
why
,
I
ca
n't
be
expected
to
be
very
sentimental
about
'em
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
not
;
that
's
the
truth
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
was
just
then
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
bars
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
his
companion
pausing
in
this
place
,
he
started
,
and
said
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
of
course
"
---
and
composed
himself
to
listen
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
I
have
been
bred
and
reared
all
my
life
by
this
grandfather
of
whom
I
have
just
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
he
has
a
great
many
good
points
---
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
;
I
'll
not
disguise
the
fact
from
you
---
but
he
has
two
very
great
faults
,
which
are
the
staple
of
his
bad
side
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
has
the
most
confirmed
obstinacy
of
character
you
ever
met
with
in
any
human
creature
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
second
,
he
is
most
abominably
selfish
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
indeed
?
"
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
those
two
respects
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
there
never
was
such
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
heard
from
those
who
know
,
that
they
have
been
,
time
out
of
mind
,
the
failings
of
our
family
;
and
I
believe
there
's
some
truth
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
say
of
my
own
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
have
to
do
,
you
know
,
is
to
be
very
thankful
that
they
have
n't
descended
to
me
,
and
,
to
be
very
careful
that
I
do
n't
contract
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
proper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
resumed
Martin
,
stirring
the
fire
once
more
,
and
drawing
his
chair
still
closer
to
it
,
"
his
selfishness
makes
him
exacting
,
you
see
;
and
his
obstinacy
makes
him
resolute
in
his
exactions
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
is
that
he
has
always
exacted
a
great
deal
from
me
in
the
way
of
respect
,
and
submission
,
and
self
-
denial
when
his
wishes
were
in
question
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
borne
a
great
deal
from
him
,
because
I
have
been
under
obligations
to
him
(
if
one
can
ever
be
said
to
be
under
obligations
to
one
's
own
grandfather
)
,
and
because
I
have
been
really
attached
to
him
;
but
we
have
had
a
great
many
quarrels
for
all
that
,
for
I
could
not
accommodate
myself
to
his
ways
very
often
---
not
out
of
the
least
reference
to
myself
,
you
understand
,
but
because
---
"
he
stammered
here
,
and
was
rather
at
a
loss
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
being
about
the
worst
man
in
the
world
to
help
anybody
out
of
a
difficulty
of
this
sort
,
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
as
you
understand
me
,
"
resumed
Martin
,
quickly
,
"
I
need
n't
hunt
for
the
precise
expression
I
want
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
come
to
the
cream
of
my
story
,
and
the
occasion
of
my
being
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
love
,
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
looked
up
into
his
face
with
increased
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
I
am
in
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
love
with
one
of
the
most
beautiful
girls
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
is
wholly
and
entirely
dependent
upon
the
pleasure
of
my
grandfather
;
and
if
he
were
to
know
that
she
favoured
my
passion
,
she
would
lose
her
home
and
everything
she
possesses
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
very
selfish
in
THAT
love
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Selfish
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
acted
nobly
.
 
<EOS>
To
love
her
as
I
am
sure
you
do
,
and
yet
in
consideration
for
her
state
of
dependence
,
not
even
to
disclose
---
"
   
"
What
are
you
talking
about
,
Pinch
?
"
said
Martin
pettishly
:
"
do
n't
make
yourself
ridiculous
,
my
good
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
not
disclosing
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
answered
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
meant
that
,
or
I
would
n't
have
said
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
did
n't
tell
her
I
loved
her
,
where
would
be
the
use
of
my
being
in
love
?
"
said
Martin
:
"
unless
to
keep
myself
in
a
perpetual
state
of
worry
and
vexation
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
Tom
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
guess
what
SHE
said
when
you
told
her
,
"
he
added
,
glancing
at
Martin
's
handsome
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
not
exactly
,
Pinch
,
"
he
rejoined
,
with
a
slight
frown
;
"
because
she
has
some
girlish
notions
about
duty
and
gratitude
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
which
are
rather
hard
to
fathom
;
but
in
the
main
you
are
right
.
 
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
mine
,
I
found
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
what
I
supposed
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
natural
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
in
his
great
satisfaction
,
he
took
a
long
sip
out
of
his
wine
-
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Although
I
had
conducted
myself
from
the
first
with
the
utmost
circumspection
,
"
pursued
Martin
,
"
<EOS>
I
had
not
managed
matters
so
well
but
that
my
grandfather
,
who
is
full
of
jealousy
and
distrust
,
suspected
me
of
loving
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
to
her
,
but
straightway
attacked
me
in
private
,
and
charged
me
with
designing
to
corrupt
the
fidelity
to
himself
(
there
you
observe
his
selfishness
)
,
of
a
young
creature
whom
he
had
trained
and
educated
to
be
his
only
disinterested
and
faithful
companion
,
when
he
should
have
disposed
of
me
in
marriage
to
his
heart
's
content
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
I
took
fire
immediately
,
and
told
him
that
with
his
good
leave
I
would
dispose
of
myself
in
marriage
,
and
would
rather
not
be
knocked
down
by
him
or
any
other
auctioneer
to
any
bidder
whomsoever
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
opened
his
eyes
wider
,
and
looked
at
the
fire
harder
than
he
had
done
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
sure
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
that
this
nettled
him
,
and
that
he
began
to
be
the
very
reverse
of
complimentary
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Interview
succeeded
interview
;
words
engendered
words
,
as
they
always
do
;
and
the
upshot
of
it
was
,
that
I
was
to
renounce
her
,
or
be
renounced
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
must
bear
in
mind
,
Pinch
,
that
I
am
not
only
desperately
fond
of
her
(
<EOS>
for
though
she
is
poor
,
her
beauty
and
intellect
would
reflect
great
credit
on
anybody
,
I
do
n't
care
of
what
pretensions
who
might
become
her
husband
)
,
but
that
a
chief
ingredient
in
my
composition
is
a
most
determined
---
"
   
"
Obstinacy
,
"
suggested
Tom
in
perfect
good
faith
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
suggestion
was
not
so
well
received
as
he
had
expected
;
for
the
young
man
immediately
rejoined
,
with
some
irritation
,
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
fellow
you
are
,
Pinch
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
thought
you
wanted
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
want
that
word
,
"
he
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
obstinacy
was
no
part
of
my
character
,
did
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
say
,
if
you
had
given
me
leave
,
that
a
chief
ingredient
in
my
composition
is
a
most
determined
firmness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
Tom
,
screwing
up
his
mouth
,
and
nodding
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
;
I
see
!
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
being
firm
,
"
pursued
Martin
,
"
of
course
I
was
not
going
to
yield
to
him
,
or
give
way
by
so
much
as
the
thousandth
part
of
an
inch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
the
more
he
urged
,
the
more
I
was
determined
to
oppose
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
rejoined
Martin
,
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
with
a
careless
wave
of
both
hands
,
as
if
the
subject
were
quite
settled
,
and
nothing
more
could
be
said
about
it
---
"
There
is
an
end
of
the
matter
,
and
here
am
I
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
sat
staring
at
the
fire
for
some
minutes
with
a
puzzled
look
,
such
as
he
might
have
assumed
if
some
uncommonly
difficult
conundrum
had
been
proposed
,
which
he
found
it
impossible
to
guess
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
said
:
   
"
Pecksniff
,
of
course
,
you
had
known
before
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
had
never
seen
him
,
for
my
grandfather
<EOS>
kept
not
only
himself
but
me
,
aloof
from
all
his
relations
.
 
<EOS>
But
our
separation
took
place
in
a
town
in
the
adjoining
country
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
place
I
came
to
Salisbury
,
and
there
I
saw
Pecksniff
's
advertisement
,
which
I
answered
,
having
always
had
some
natural
taste
,
I
believe
,
in
the
matters
to
which
it
referred
,
and
thinking
it
might
suit
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
found
it
to
be
his
,
I
was
doubly
bent
on
coming
to
him
if
possible
,
on
account
of
his
being
---
"
   
"
Such
an
excellent
man
,
"
interposed
Tom
,
rubbing
his
hands
:
"
<EOS>
so
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
quite
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
not
so
much
on
that
account
,
if
the
truth
must
be
spoken
,
"
returned
Martin
,
"
as
because
my
grandfather
has
an
inveterate
dislike
to
him
,
and
after
the
old
man
's
arbitrary
treatment
of
me
,
I
had
a
natural
desire
to
run
as
directly
counter
to
all
his
opinions
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
As
I
said
before
,
here
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
My
engagement
with
the
young
lady
I
have
been
telling
you
about
is
likely
to
be
a
tolerably
long
one
;
for
neither
her
prospects
nor
mine
are
very
bright
;
and
of
course
I
shall
not
think
of
marrying
until
I
am
well
able
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
,
you
know
,
for
me
to
be
plunging
myself
into
poverty
and
shabbiness
and
love
in
one
room
up
three
pair
of
stairs
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
say
nothing
of
her
,
"
remarked
Tom
Pinch
,
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
,
"
rejoined
Martin
,
rising
to
warm
his
back
,
and
leaning
against
the
chimney
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
say
nothing
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
of
course
it
's
not
very
hard
upon
her
to
be
obliged
to
yield
to
the
necessity
of
the
case
;
first
,
because
she
loves
me
very
much
;
and
secondly
,
because
I
have
sacrificed
a
great
deal
on
her
account
,
and
might
have
done
much
better
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
long
time
before
Tom
said
"
Certainly
;
"
so
long
,
that
he
might
have
taken
a
nap
in
the
interval
,
but
he
did
say
it
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
there
is
one
odd
coincidence
connected
with
this
love
-
story
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
which
brings
it
to
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
what
you
told
me
last
night
as
we
were
coming
here
,
about
your
pretty
visitor
in
the
church
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
I
do
,
"
said
Tom
,
rising
from
his
stool
,
and
seating
himself
in
the
chair
from
which
the
other
had
lately
risen
,
that
he
might
see
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
she
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
what
you
were
going
to
say
,
"
cried
Tom
,
looking
fixedly
at
him
,
and
speaking
very
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
tell
me
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
she
,
"
repeated
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
what
I
have
heard
from
Pecksniff
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
she
came
and
went
with
my
grandfather
.
<EOS>
---
Do
n't
you
drink
too
much
of
that
sour
wine
,
or
you
'll
have
a
fit
of
some
sort
,
Pinch
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
very
wholesome
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Tom
,
setting
down
the
empty
glass
he
had
for
some
time
held
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
that
was
she
,
was
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
nodded
assent
;
and
adding
,
with
a
restless
impatience
,
that
if
he
had
been
a
few
days
earlier
he
would
have
seen
her
;
and
that
now
she
might
be
,
for
anything
he
knew
,
hundreds
of
miles
away
;
threw
himself
,
after
a
few
turns
across
the
room
,
into
a
chair
,
and
chafed
like
a
spoilt
child
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
's
heart
was
very
tender
,
and
he
could
not
bear
to
see
the
most
indifferent
person
in
distress
;
still
less
one
who
had
awakened
an
interest
in
him
,
and
who
regarded
him
(
either
in
fact
,
or
as
he
supposed
)
with
kindness
,
and
in
a
spirit
of
lenient
construction
.
<EOS>
Whatever
his
own
thoughts
had
been
a
few
moments
before
---
and
to
judge
from
his
face
they
must
have
been
pretty
serious
---
he
dismissed
them
instantly
,
and
gave
his
young
friend
the
best
counsel
and
comfort
that
occurred
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
will
be
well
in
time
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
have
no
doubt
;
and
some
trial
and
adversity
just
now
will
only
serve
to
make
you
more
attached
to
each
other
in
better
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
read
that
the
truth
is
so
,
and
I
have
a
feeling
within
me
,
which
tells
me
how
natural
and
right
<EOS>
it
is
that
it
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
That
never
ran
smooth
yet
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
smile
which
,
despite
the
homeliness
of
his
face
,
was
pleasanter
to
see
than
many
a
proud
beauty
's
brightest
glance
;
"
what
never
ran
smooth
yet
,
can
hardly
be
expected
to
change
its
character
for
us
;
so
we
must
take
it
as
we
find
it
,
and
fashion
it
into
the
very
best
shape
we
can
,
by
patience
and
good
-
humour
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
power
at
all
;
I
need
n't
tell
you
that
;
but
I
have
an
excellent
will
;
and
if
I
could
ever
be
of
use
to
you
,
in
any
way
whatever
,
how
very
glad
I
should
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Martin
,
shaking
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
good
fellow
,
upon
my
word
,
and
speak
very
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
you
know
,
"
he
added
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
as
he
drew
his
chair
towards
the
fire
again
,
"
I
should
not
hesitate
to
avail
myself
of
your
services
if
you
could
help
me
at
all
;
but
mercy
on
us
!
"
<EOS>
---
Here
he
rumpled
his
hair
impatiently
with
his
hand
,
and
looked
at
Tom
as
if
he
took
it
rather
ill
that
he
was
not
somebody
else
---
"
you
might
as
well
be
a
toasting
-
fork
or
a
frying
-
pan
,
Pinch
,
for
any
help
you
can
render
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Except
in
the
inclination
,
"
said
Tom
,
gently
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
meant
that
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
If
inclination
went
for
anything
,
I
should
n't
want
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
you
may
do
,
though
,
if
you
will
,
and
at
the
present
moment
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
demanded
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Read
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
,
"
cried
Tom
,
catching
up
the
candle
with
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
my
leaving
you
in
the
dark
a
moment
,
and
I
'll
fetch
a
book
directly
.
 
<EOS>
What
will
you
like
?
 
<EOS>
Shakespeare
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
replied
his
friend
,
yawning
and
stretching
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
tired
with
the
bustle
of
to
-
day
,
and
the
novelty
of
everything
about
me
;
and
in
such
a
case
,
there
's
no
greater
luxury
in
the
world
,
I
think
,
than
being
read
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
mind
my
going
to
sleep
,
if
I
can
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
!
"
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
begin
as
soon
as
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
leave
off
when
you
see
me
getting
drowsy
(
unless
you
feel
tired
)
,
for
it
's
pleasant
to
wake
gradually
to
the
sounds
again
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
try
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
never
tried
that
,
"
said
Tom
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
You
can
,
you
know
,
one
of
these
days
when
we
're
both
in
the
right
humour
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
leaving
me
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Look
sharp
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
lost
no
time
in
moving
away
;
and
in
a
minute
or
two
returned
with
one
of
the
precious
volumes
from
the
shelf
beside
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
had
in
the
meantime
made
himself
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
would
permit
,
by
constructing
before
the
fire
a
temporary
sofa
of
three
chairs
with
Mercy
's
stool
for
a
pillow
,
and
lying
down
at
full
-
length
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
too
loud
,
please
,
"
he
said
to
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
sure
you
're
not
cold
"
   
"
Not
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
ready
,
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
accordingly
,
after
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
book
with
as
much
care
as
if
they
were
living
and
highly
cherished
creatures
,
made
his
own
selection
,
and
began
to
read
.
 
<EOS>
Before
he
had
completed
fifty
lines
his
friend
was
snoring
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
softly
,
as
he
stretched
out
his
head
to
peep
at
him
over
the
backs
of
the
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
young
to
have
so
much
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
How
trustful
and
generous
in
him
to
bestow
all
this
confidence
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
was
she
<EOS>
,
was
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
suddenly
remembering
their
compact
,
he
took
up
the
poem
at
the
place
where
he
had
left
off
,
and
went
on
reading
;
always
forgetting
to
snuff
the
candle
,
until
its
wick
looked
like
a
mushroom
.
 
<EOS>
He
gradually
became
so
much
interested
,
that
he
quite
forgot
to
replenish
the
fire
;
and
was
only
reminded
of
his
neglect
by
Martin
Chuzzlewit
starting
up
after
the
lapse
of
an
hour
or
so
,
and
crying
with
a
shiver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
nearly
out
,
I
declare
!
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
I
dreamed
of
being
frozen
.
 
<EOS>
Do
call
for
some
coals
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
fellow
you
are
,
Pinch
!

In

Slyme

Martin
began
to
work
at
the
grammar
-
school
next
morning
,
with
so
much
vigour
and
expedition
,
that
Mr
Pinch
had
new
reason
to
do
homage
to
the
natural
endowments
of
that
young
gentleman
,
and
to
acknowledge
his
infinite
superiority
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
pupil
received
Tom
's
compliments
very
graciously
;
and
having
by
this
time
conceived
a
real
regard
for
him
,
in
his
own
peculiar
way
,
predicted
that
they
would
always
be
the
very
best
of
friends
,
and
that
neither
of
them
,
he
was
certain
(
but
particularly
Tom
)
,
would
ever
have
reason
to
regret
the
day
on
which
they
became
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
was
delighted
to
hear
him
say
this
,
and
felt
so
much
flattered
by
his
kind
assurances
of
friendship
and
protection
,
that
he
was
at
a
loss
how
to
express
the
pleasure
they
afforded
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
it
may
be
observed
of
this
friendship
,
such
as
it
was
,
that
it
had
within
it
more
likely
materials
of
endurance
than
many
a
sworn
brotherhood
that
has
been
rich
in
promise
;
for
so
long
as
the
one
party
found
a
pleasure
in
patronizing
,
and
the
other
in
being
patronised
(
which
was
in
the
very
essence
of
their
respective
characters
)
<EOS>
,
it
was
of
all
possible
events
among
the
least
probable
,
that
the
twin
demons
,
Envy
and
Pride
,
would
ever
arise
between
them
.
<EOS>
So
in
very
many
cases
of
friendship
,
or
what
passes
for
it
,
the
old
axiom
is
reversed
,
and
like
clings
to
unlike
more
than
to
like
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
both
very
busy
on
the
afternoon
succeeding
the
family
's
departure
---
Martin
with
the
grammar
-
school
,
and
Tom
in
balancing
certain
receipts
of
rents
,
and
deducting
Mr
Pecksniff
's
commission
from
the
same
;
in
which
abstruse
employment
he
was
much
distracted
by
a
habit
his
new
friend
had
of
whistling
aloud
while
he
was
drawing
---
when
they
were
not
a
little
startled
by
the
unexpected
obtrusion
into
that
sanctuary
of
genius
,
of
a
human
head
which
,
although
a
shaggy
and
somewhat
alarming
head
in
appearance
,
smiled
affably
upon
them
from
the
doorway
,
in
a
manner
that
was
at
once
waggish
,
conciliatory
,
and
expressive
of
approbation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
industrious
myself
,
gents
both
,
"
said
the
head
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
how
to
appreciate
that
quality
in
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
turn
grey
and
ugly
,
if
it
is
n't
in
my
opinion
,
next
to
genius
,
one
of
the
very
charmingest
qualities
of
the
human
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
,
I
am
grateful
to
my
friend
Pecksniff
for
helping
me
to
the
contemplation
of
such
a
delicious
picture
as
you
present
.
 
<EOS>
You
remind
me
of
Whittington
,
afterwards
thrice
Lord
Mayor
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
my
unsullied
word
of
honour
,
that
you
very
strongly
remind
me
of
that
historical
character
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
pair
of
Whittingtons
,
gents
,
without
the
cat
;
which
is
a
most
agreeable
and
blessed
exception
to
me
,
for
I
am
not
attached
to
the
feline
species
.
 
<EOS>
My
name
is
Tigg
;
how
do
you
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
looked
to
Mr
Pinch
for
an
explanation
;
and
Tom
,
who
had
never
in
his
life
set
eyes
on
Mr
Tigg
before
,
looked
to
that
gentleman
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Chevy
Slyme
?
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
interrogatively
,
and
kissing
his
left
hand
in
token
of
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
understand
me
when
I
say
that
I
am
the
accredited
agent
of
Chevy
Slyme
;
that
I
am
the
ambassador
from
the
court
of
Chiv
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
Heyday
!
"
asked
Martin
,
starting
at
the
mention
of
a
name
he
knew
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
what
does
he
want
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
your
name
is
Pinch
"
---
Mr
Tigg
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
"
said
Martin
,
checking
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
that
is
Mr
Pinch
,
"
cried
Tigg
,
kissing
his
hand
again
,
and
beginning
to
follow
his
head
into
the
room
,
"
he
will
permit
me
to
say
that
I
greatly
esteem
and
respect
his
character
,
which
has
been
most
highly
commended
to
me
by
my
friend
Pecksniff
;
and
that
I
deeply
appreciate
his
talent
for
the
organ
,
notwithstanding
that
I
do
not
,
if
I
may
use
the
expression
,
grind
myself
.
 
<EOS>
If
that
is
Mr
Pinch
,
I
will
venture
to
express
a
hope
that
I
see
him
well
,
and
that
he
is
suffering
no
inconvenience
from
the
easterly
wind
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
comfort
,
"
Mr
Tigg
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
he
added
,
shielding
his
lips
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
and
applying
them
close
to
Mr
Pinch
's
ear
<EOS>
,
"
I
have
come
for
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
letter
,
"
said
Tom
,
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
letter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
letter
,
"
whispered
Tigg
in
the
same
cautious
manner
as
before
,
"
which
my
friend
Pecksniff
addressed
to
Chevy
Slyme
,
Esquire
,
and
left
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
leave
any
letter
with
me
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
cried
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
the
same
thing
,
though
not
so
delicately
done
by
my
friend
Pecksniff
as
I
could
have
wished
.
 
<EOS>
The
money
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
money
!
"
cried
Tom
quite
scared
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
With
which
he
rapped
Tom
twice
or
thrice
upon
the
breast
and
nodded
several
times
,
as
though
he
would
say
that
he
saw
they
understood
each
other
;
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
mention
the
circumstance
before
a
third
person
;
and
that
he
would
take
it
as
a
particular
favour
if
Tom
would
slip
the
amount
into
his
hand
,
as
quietly
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
however
,
was
so
very
much
astounded
by
this
(
to
him
)
inexplicable
deportment
,
that
he
at
once
openly
declared
there
must
be
some
mistake
,
and
that
he
had
been
entrusted
with
no
commission
whatever
having
any
reference
to
Mr
Tigg
or
to
his
friend
,
either
.
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
received
this
declaration
with
a
grave
request
that
Mr
Pinch
would
have
the
goodness
to
make
it
again
;
and
on
Tom
's
repeating
it
in
a
still
more
emphatic
and
unmistakable
manner
,
checked
it
off
,
sentence
for
sentence
,
by
nodding
his
head
solemnly
at
the
end
of
each
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
had
come
to
a
close
for
the
second
time
,
Mr
Tigg
sat
himself
down
in
a
chair
and
addressed
the
young
men
as
follows
:
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
tell
you
what
it
is
,
gents
both
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
at
this
present
moment
in
this
very
place
,
a
perfect
constellation
of
talent
and
genius
,
who
is
involved
,
through
what
I
can
not
but
designate
as
the
culpable
negligence
of
my
friend
Pecksniff
,
in
a
situation
as
tremendous
,
perhaps
,
as
the
social
intercourse
of
the
nineteenth
century
will
readily
admit
of
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
actually
at
this
instant
,
at
the
Blue
Dragon
in
this
village
---
an
ale
-
house
,
observe
;
a
common
,
paltry
,
low
-
minded
,
clodhopping
,
pipe
-
smoking
ale
-
house
---
an
individual
,
of
whom
it
may
be
said
,
in
the
language
of
the
Poet
,
that
nobody
but
himself
can
in
any
way
come
up
to
him
;
who
is
detained
there
for
his
bill
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
For
his
bill
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
---
 
for
his
bill
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
"
we
have
heard
of
Fox
's
Book
of
Martyrs
,
I
believe
,
and
we
have
heard
of
the
Court
of
Requests
,
and
the
Star
Chamber
;
but
I
fear
the
contradiction
of
no
man
alive
or
dead
,
when
I
assert
that
my
friend
Chevy
Slyme
being
held
in
pawn
for
a
bill
,
beats
any
amount
of
cockfighting
with
which
I
am
acquainted
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
and
Mr
Pinch
looked
,
first
at
each
other
,
and
afterwards
at
Mr
Tigg
,
who
with
his
arms
folded
on
his
breast
surveyed
them
,
<EOS>
half
in
despondency
and
half
in
bitterness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mistake
me
,
gents
both
,
"
he
said
,
stretching
forth
his
right
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
been
for
anything
but
a
bill
,
I
could
have
borne
it
,
and
could
still
have
looked
upon
mankind
with
some
feeling
of
respect
;
but
when
such
a
man
as
my
friend
Slyme
is
detained
for
a
score
---
a
thing
in
itself
essentially
mean
;
a
low
performance
on
a
slate
,
or
possibly
chalked
upon
the
back
of
a
door
<EOS>
---
I
do
feel
that
there
is
a
screw
of
such
magnitude
loose
somewhere
,
that
the
whole
framework
of
society
is
shaken
,
and
the
very
first
principles
of
things
can
no
longer
be
trusted
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
gents
both
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
with
a
passionate
flourish
of
his
hands
and
head
,
"
when
a
man
like
Slyme
is
detained
for
such
a
thing
as
a
bill
,
I
reject
the
superstitions
of
ages
,
and
believe
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
even
believe
that
I
DON'T
believe
,
curse
me
if
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Tom
after
a
pause
,
"
but
Mr
Pecksniff
said
nothing
to
me
about
it
,
and
I
could
n't
act
without
his
instructions
.
 
<EOS>
Would
n't
it
be
better
,
sir
,
if
you
were
to
go
to
 
---
to
wherever
you
came
from
---
yourself
,
and
remit
the
money
to
your
friend
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
that
be
done
,
when
I
am
detained
also
?
"
said
Mr
Tigg
;
"
and
when
moreover
,
owing
to
the
astounding
,
and
I
must
add
,
guilty
negligence
of
my
friend
Pecksniff
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
money
for
coach
-
hire
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
thought
of
reminding
the
gentleman
(
who
,
no
doubt
,
in
his
agitation
had
forgotten
it
)
<EOS>
that
there
was
a
post
-
office
in
the
land
;
and
that
possibly
if
he
wrote
to
some
friend
or
agent
for
a
remittance
it
might
not
be
lost
upon
the
road
;
or
at
all
events
that
the
chance
,
however
desperate
,
was
worth
trusting
to
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
his
good
-
nature
presently
suggested
to
him
certain
reasons
for
abstaining
from
this
hint
,
he
paused
again
,
and
then
asked
:
   
"
Did
you
say
,
sir
,
that
you
were
detained
also
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
objection
to
my
opening
this
window
for
a
moment
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Certainly
not
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
lifting
the
sash
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
a
fellow
down
there
in
a
red
neckcloth
and
no
waistcoat
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
Mark
Tapley
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
Tapley
is
it
?
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
Mark
Tapley
had
not
only
the
great
politeness
to
follow
me
to
this
house
,
but
is
waiting
now
,
to
see
me
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
for
that
attention
,
sir
,
"
added
Mr
Tigg
,
stroking
his
moustache
,
"
I
can
tell
you
,
that
Mark
Tapley
had
better
in
his
infancy
have
been
fed
to
suffocation
by
Mrs
Tapley
,
than
preserved
to
this
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
was
not
so
dismayed
by
this
terrible
threat
,
but
that
he
had
voice
enough
to
call
to
Mark
to
come
in
,
and
upstairs
;
a
summons
which
he
so
speedily
obeyed
,
that
almost
as
soon
as
Tom
and
Mr
Tigg
had
drawn
in
their
heads
and
closed
the
window
again
,
he
,
the
denounced
,
appeared
before
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
Mark
!
"
said
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
between
Mrs
Lupin
and
this
gentleman
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
gentleman
,
sir
?
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
no
gentleman
here
sir
,
excepting
you
and
the
new
gentleman
,
"
to
whom
he
made
a
rough
kind
of
bow
---
"
and
there
's
nothing
wrong
between
Mrs
Lupin
and
either
of
you
,
Mr
Pinch
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
Mark
!
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
Mr
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Tigg
,
"
interposed
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
crush
him
soon
.
 
<EOS>
All
in
good
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
HIM
!
"
rejoined
Mark
,
with
an
air
of
careless
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
see
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
him
a
little
better
,
if
he
'd
shave
himself
,
and
get
his
hair
cut
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
shook
his
head
with
a
ferocious
look
,
and
smote
himself
once
upon
the
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
knock
ever
so
much
in
that
quarter
,
you
'll
get
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
there
but
padding
;
and
a
greasy
sort
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Mark
,
"
urged
Mr
Pinch
,
interposing
to
prevent
hostilities
,
"
tell
me
what
I
ask
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
not
out
of
temper
,
I
hope
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
Out
of
temper
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
,
with
a
grin
;
"
why
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
little
credit
---
not
much
---
in
being
jolly
,
when
such
fellows
as
him
is
a
-
going
about
like
roaring
lions
;
if
there
is
any
breed
of
lions
,
at
least
,
as
is
all
roar
and
mane
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
there
between
him
and
Mrs
Lupin
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
there
's
a
score
between
him
and
Mrs
Lupin
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
Mrs
Lupin
lets
him
and
his
friend
off
very
easy
in
not
charging
'em
double
prices
for
being
a
disgrace
to
the
Dragon
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
any
such
Peter
the
Wild
Boy
as
him
in
my
house
,
sir
,
not
if
I
was
paid
race
-
week
prices
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
's
enough
to
turn
the
very
beer
in
the
casks
sour
with
his
looks
;
he
is
!
<EOS>
So
he
would
,
if
it
had
judgment
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
answering
my
question
,
you
know
,
Mark
,
"
observed
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
I
do
n't
know
as
there
's
much
to
answer
further
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
Him
and
his
friend
goes
and
stops
at
the
Moon
and
Stars
till
they
've
run
a
bill
there
;
and
then
comes
and
stops
with
us
and
does
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
The
running
of
bills
is
common
enough
Mr
Pinch
;
it
an't
that
as
we
object
to
;
it
's
the
ways
of
this
chap
.
<EOS>
Nothing
's
good
enough
for
him
;
all
the
women
is
dying
for
him
he
thinks
,
and
is
overpaid
if
he
winks
at
'em
;
and
all
the
men
was
made
to
be
ordered
about
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
not
being
aggravation
enough
,
he
says
this
morning
to
me
,
in
his
usual
captivating
way
,
"
We
're
going
to
-
night
,
my
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
,
sir
?
"
says
I.
 
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'd
like
the
bill
got
ready
,
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
my
man
<EOS>
,
"
he
says
;
"
you
need
n't
mind
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
give
Pecksniff
orders
to
see
to
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
reply
to
which
,
the
Dragon
makes
answer
,
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
you
're
very
kind
to
honour
us
so
far
,
but
as
we
do
n't
know
any
particular
good
of
you
,
and
you
do
n't
travel
with
luggage
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
an't
at
home
(
which
perhaps
you
may
n't
happen
to
be
aware
of
,
sir
)
,
we
should
prefer
something
more
satisfactory
;
"
and
that
's
where
the
matter
stands
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
ask
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
pointing
,
in
conclusion
,
to
Mr
Tigg
,
with
his
hat
,
"
any
lady
or
gentleman
,
possessing
ordinary
strength
of
mind
,
to
say
whether
he
's
a
disagreeable
-
looking
chap
or
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
inquire
,
"
said
Martin
,
interposing
between
this
candid
speech
and
the
delivery
of
some
blighting
anathema
by
Mr
Tigg
,
"
what
the
amount
of
this
debt
may
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
point
of
money
,
sir
,
very
little
,
"
answered
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
just
turned
of
three
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
an't
<EOS>
that
;
it
's
the
---
"
   
"
Yes
,
yes
,
you
told
us
so
before
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pinch
,
a
word
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Tom
,
retiring
with
him
to
a
corner
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
simply
---
I
am
ashamed
to
say
---
that
this
Mr
Slyme
is
a
relation
of
mine
,
of
whom
I
never
heard
anything
pleasant
;
and
that
I
do
n't
want
him
here
just
now
,
and
think
he
would
be
cheaply
got
rid
of
,
perhaps
,
for
three
or
four
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
n't
enough
money
to
pay
this
bill
,
I
suppose
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
shook
his
head
to
an
extent
that
left
no
doubt
of
his
entire
sincerity
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
unfortunate
,
for
I
am
poor
too
;
and
in
case
you
had
had
it
,
I
'd
have
borrowed
it
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
we
told
this
landlady
we
would
see
her
paid
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
that
would
answer
the
same
purpose
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
yes
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
knows
me
,
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
let
us
go
down
at
once
and
tell
her
so
;
for
the
sooner
we
are
rid
of
their
company
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
As
you
have
conducted
the
conversation
with
this
gentleman
hitherto
,
perhaps
you
'll
tell
him
what
we
purpose
doing
;
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
complying
,
at
once
imparted
the
intelligence
to
Mr
Tigg
,
who
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
in
return
,
assuring
him
that
his
faith
in
anything
and
everything
was
again
restored
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
much
,
he
said
,
for
the
temporary
relief
of
this
assistance
that
he
prized
it
,
as
for
its
vindication
of
the
high
principle
that
Nature
's
Nobs
felt
with
Nature
's
Nobs
,
and
that
true
greatness
of
soul
sympathized
with
true
greatness
of
soul
,
all
the
world
over
.
<EOS>
It
proved
to
him
,
he
said
,
that
like
him
they
admired
genius
,
even
when
it
was
coupled
with
the
alloy
occasionally
visible
in
the
metal
of
his
friend
Slyme
;
and
on
behalf
of
that
friend
,
he
thanked
them
;
as
warmly
and
heartily
as
if
the
cause
were
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
Being
cut
short
in
these
speeches
by
a
general
move
towards
the
stairs
,
he
took
possession
at
the
street
door
of
the
lapel
of
Mr
Pinch
's
coat
,
as
a
security
against
further
interruption
;
and
entertained
that
gentleman
with
some
highly
improving
discourse
until
they
reached
the
Dragon
,
whither
they
were
closely
followed
by
Mark
and
the
new
pupil
.
   
<EOS>
The
rosy
hostess
scarcely
needed
Mr
Pinch
's
word
as
a
preliminary
to
the
release
of
her
two
visitors
,
of
whom
she
was
glad
to
be
rid
on
any
terms
;
indeed
,
their
brief
detention
had
originated
mainly
with
Mr
Tapley
,
who
entertained
a
constitutional
dislike
to
gentleman
out
-
at
-
elbows
who
flourished
on
false
pretences
;
and
had
conceived
a
particular
aversion
to
Mr
Tigg
and
his
friend
,
as
choice
specimens
of
the
species
.
 
<EOS>
The
business
in
hand
thus
easily
settled
,
Mr
Pinch
and
Martin
would
have
withdrawn
immediately
,
but
for
the
urgent
entreaties
of
Mr
Tigg
that
they
would
allow
him
the
honour
of
presenting
them
to
his
friend
Slyme
,
which
were
so
very
difficult
of
resistance
that
,
yielding
partly
to
these
persuasions
and
partly
to
their
own
curiosity
,
they
suffered
themselves
to
be
ushered
into
the
presence
of
that
distinguished
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
brooding
over
the
remains
of
yesterday
's
decanter
of
brandy
,
and
was
engaged
in
the
thoughtful
occupation
of
making
a
chain
of
rings
on
the
top
of
the
table
with
the
wet
foot
of
his
drinking
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Wretched
and
forlorn
as
he
looked
,
Mr
Slyme
had
once
been
in
his
way
,
the
choicest
of
swaggerers
;
putting
forth
his
pretensions
boldly
,
as
a
man
of
infinite
taste
and
most
undoubted
promise
.
 
<EOS>
The
stock
-
in
-
trade
requisite
to
set
up
an
amateur
in
this
department
of
business
is
very
slight
,
and
easily
got
together
;
a
trick
of
the
nose
and
a
curl
of
the
lip
sufficient
to
compound
a
tolerable
sneer
,
being
ample
provision
for
any
exigency
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
this
off
-
shoot
of
the
Chuzzlewit
trunk
,
being
lazy
,
and
ill
qualified
for
any
regular
pursuit
and
having
dissipated
such
means
as
he
ever
possessed
,
had
formally
established
himself
as
a
professor
of
Taste
for
a
livelihood
;
and
finding
,
too
late
,
that
something
more
than
his
old
amount
of
qualifications
was
necessary
to
sustain
him
in
this
calling
,
<EOS>
had
quickly
fallen
to
his
present
level
,
where
he
retained
nothing
of
his
old
self
but
his
boastfulness
and
his
bile
,
and
seemed
to
have
no
existence
separate
or
apart
from
his
friend
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
so
abject
and
so
pitiful
<EOS>
was
he
---
at
once
so
maudlin
,
insolent
,
beggarly
,
and
proud
---
that
even
his
friend
and
parasite
,
standing
erect
beside
him
,
swelled
into
a
Man
by
contrast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Chiv
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
clapping
him
on
the
back
,
"
my
friend
Pecksniff
not
being
at
home
,
I
have
arranged
our
trifling
piece
of
business
with
Mr
Pinch
and
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
and
friend
,
Mr
Chevy
Slyme
!
<EOS>
Chiv
,
Mr
Pinch
and
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
These
are
agreeable
circumstances
in
which
to
be
introduced
to
strangers
,
"
said
Chevy
Slyme
,
turning
his
bloodshot
eyes
towards
Tom
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
most
miserable
man
in
the
world
,
I
believe
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
begged
he
would
n't
mention
it
;
and
finding
him
in
this
condition
,
retired
,
after
an
awkward
pause
,
followed
by
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Tigg
so
urgently
conjured
them
,
by
coughs
and
signs
,
to
remain
in
the
shadow
of
the
door
,
that
they
stopped
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
swear
,
"
cried
Mr
Slyme
,
giving
the
table
an
imbecile
blow
with
his
fist
,
and
then
feebly
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
while
some
drunken
drops
oozed
from
his
eyes
,
"
that
I
am
the
wretchedest
creature
on
record
.
 
<EOS>
Society
is
in
a
conspiracy
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
the
most
literary
man
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
full
of
scholarship
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
full
of
genius
;
I
'm
full
of
information
;
I
'm
full
of
novel
views
on
every
subject
;
yet
look
at
my
condition
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
<EOS>
at
this
moment
obliged
to
two
strangers
for
a
tavern
bill
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
replenished
his
friend
's
glass
,
pressed
it
into
his
hand
,
and
nodded
an
intimation
to
the
visitors
that
they
would
see
him
in
a
better
aspect
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
"
Obliged
to
two
strangers
for
a
tavern
bill
,
eh
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Slyme
,
after
a
sulky
application
to
his
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
pretty
!
 
<EOS>
And
crowds
of
impostors
,
the
while
,
becoming
famous
;
men
who
are
no
more
on
a
level
with
me
than
---
<EOS>
Tigg
,
I
take
you
to
witness
that
I
am
the
most
persecuted
hound
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
whine
,
not
unlike
the
cry
of
the
animal
he
named
,
in
its
lowest
state
of
humiliation
,
he
raised
his
glass
to
his
mouth
again
.
<EOS>
He
found
some
encouragement
in
it
;
for
when
he
set
it
down
he
laughed
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
Mr
Tigg
gesticulated
to
the
visitors
once
more
,
and
with
great
expression
,
implying
that
now
the
time
was
come
when
they
would
see
Chiv
in
his
greatness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
,
"
laughed
Mr
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
"
Obliged
to
two
strangers
for
a
tavern
bill
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
think
I
've
a
rich
uncle
,
Tigg
,
who
could
buy
up
the
uncles
of
fifty
strangers
!
 
<EOS>
Have
I
,
or
have
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
come
of
a
good
family
,
I
believe
!
 
<EOS>
Do
I
,
or
do
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
man
of
common
capacity
or
accomplishments
,
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
Am
I
,
or
am
I
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
American
aloe
of
the
human
race
,
my
dear
Chiv
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
"
which
only
blooms
once
in
a
hundred
years
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
Mr
Slyme
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Obliged
to
two
strangers
for
a
tavern
bill
!
 
<EOS>
I
obliged
to
two
architect
's
apprentices
.
 
<EOS>
Fellows
who
measure
earth
with
iron
chains
,
and
build
houses
like
bricklayers
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
the
names
of
those
two
apprentices
.
 
<EOS>
How
dare
they
oblige
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
was
quite
lost
in
admiration
of
this
noble
trait
in
his
friend
's
character
;
as
he
made
known
to
Mr
Pinch
in
a
neat
little
ballet
of
action
,
spontaneously
invented
for
the
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
let
'em
know
,
and
I
'll
let
all
men
know
,
"
cried
Chevy
Slyme
,
"
that
I
'm
none
of
the
mean
,
grovelling
,
tame
characters
they
meet
with
commonly
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
independent
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
heart
that
swells
in
my
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
soul
that
rises
superior
to
base
considerations
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
Chiv
,
Chiv
,
"
murmured
Mr
Tigg
,
"
you
have
a
nobly
independent
nature
,
Chiv
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
go
and
do
your
duty
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Slyme
,
angrily
,
"
and
borrow
money
for
travelling
expenses
;
and
whoever
you
borrow
it
of
<EOS>
,
let
'em
know
that
I
possess
a
haughty
spirit
,
and
a
proud
spirit
,
and
have
infernally
finely
-
touched
chords
in
my
nature
,
which
wo
n't
brook
patronage
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
'em
I
hate
'em
,
and
that
that
's
the
way
I
preserve
my
self
-
respect
;
and
tell
'em
that
no
man
ever
respected
himself
more
than
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
might
have
added
that
he
hated
two
sorts
of
men
;
all
those
who
did
him
favours
,
and
all
those
who
were
better
off
than
himself
;
as
in
either
case
their
position
was
an
insult
to
a
man
of
his
stupendous
merits
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
;
for
with
the
apt
closing
words
above
recited
<EOS>
,
Mr
Slyme
;
of
too
haughty
a
stomach
to
work
,
to
beg
,
to
borrow
,
or
to
steal
;
yet
mean
enough
to
be
worked
or
borrowed
,
begged
or
stolen
for
,
by
any
catspaw
that
would
serve
his
turn
;
too
insolent
to
lick
the
hand
that
fed
him
in
his
need
,
yet
cur
enough
to
bite
and
tear
it
in
the
dark
;
with
these
apt
closing
words
Mr
Slyme
fell
forward
with
his
head
upon
the
table
,
and
so
declined
into
a
sodden
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
there
ever
,
"
cried
Mr
Tigg
,
joining
the
young
men
at
the
door
,
and
shutting
it
carefully
behind
him
,
"
such
an
independent
spirit
as
is
possessed
by
that
extraordinary
creature
?
 
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
such
a
Roman
as
our
friend
Chiv
?
 
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
a
man
of
such
a
purely
classical
turn
of
thought
,
and
of
such
a
toga
-
like
simplicity
of
nature
?
 
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
a
man
with
such
a
flow
of
eloquence
?
 
<EOS>
Might
he
not
,
gents
both
<EOS>
,
I
ask
,
have
sat
upon
a
tripod
in
the
ancient
times
,
and
prophesied
to
a
perfectly
unlimited
extent
,
if
previously
supplied
with
gin
-
and
-
water
at
the
public
cost
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
was
about
to
contest
this
latter
position
with
his
usual
mildness
,
when
,
observing
that
his
companion
had
already
gone
downstairs
,
he
prepared
to
follow
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
,
Mr
Pinch
?
"
said
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
answered
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
come
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
I
should
like
one
little
word
in
private
with
you
Mr
Pinch
?
"
said
Tigg
,
following
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
minute
of
your
company
in
the
skittle
-
ground
would
very
much
relieve
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Might
I
beseech
that
favour
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
replied
Tom
,
"
if
you
really
wish
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
he
accompanied
Mr
Tigg
to
the
retreat
in
question
;
on
arriving
at
which
place
that
gentleman
took
from
his
hat
what
seemed
to
be
the
fossil
remains
of
an
antediluvian
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
wiped
his
eyes
therewith
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
beheld
me
this
day
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
"
in
a
favourable
light
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
mention
that
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
beg
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
NOT
,
"
cried
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
persist
in
that
opinion
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
have
seen
me
,
Mr
Pinch
,
at
the
head
of
my
regiment
on
the
coast
of
Africa
,
charging
in
the
form
of
a
hollow
square
,
with
the
women
and
children
and
the
regimental
plate
-
chest
in
the
centre
,
you
would
not
have
known
me
for
the
same
man
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
respected
me
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
had
certain
ideas
of
his
own
upon
the
subject
of
glory
;
and
consequently
he
was
not
quite
so
much
excited
by
this
picture
as
Mr
Tigg
could
have
desired
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
no
matter
!
"
said
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
school
-
boy
writing
home
to
his
parents
and
describing
the
milk
-
and
-
water
,
said
"
This
is
indeed
weakness
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
that
assertion
in
reference
to
myself
at
the
present
moment
;
and
I
ask
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
have
seen
my
friend
Slyme
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
you
have
been
impressed
by
my
friend
Slyme
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
very
pleasantly
,
I
must
say
,
"
answered
Tom
,
after
a
little
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
grieved
but
not
surprised
,
"
cried
Mr
Tigg
,
detaining
him
with
both
hands
,
"
to
hear
that
you
have
come
to
that
conclusion
;
for
it
is
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mr
Pinch
,
though
I
am
a
rough
and
thoughtless
man
,
I
can
honour
Mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
honour
Mind
in
following
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
To
you
of
all
men
,
Mr
Pinch
,
I
have
a
right
to
make
appeal
on
Mind
's
behalf
,
when
it
has
not
the
art
to
push
its
fortune
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
sir
---
not
for
myself
,
who
have
no
claim
upon
you
,
but
for
my
crushed
,
my
sensitive
and
independent
friend
,
who
has
---
I
ask
the
loan
of
three
half
-
crowns
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
you
for
the
loan
of
three
half
-
crowns
,
distinctly
,
and
without
a
blush
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
it
,
almost
as
a
right
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
add
that
they
will
be
returned
by
post
,
this
week
,
I
feel
that
you
will
blame
me
for
that
sordid
stipulation
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
took
from
his
pocket
an
old
-
fashioned
red
-
leather
purse
with
a
steel
clasp
,
which
had
probably
once
belonged
to
his
deceased
grandmother
.
 
<EOS>
It
held
one
half
-
sovereign
and
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
All
Tom
's
worldly
wealth
until
next
quarter
-
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Tigg
,
who
had
watched
this
proceeding
keenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
about
to
say
,
that
for
the
convenience
of
posting
you
had
better
make
it
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
A
general
direction
,
I
suppose
,
to
Mr
Pinch
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
---
will
that
find
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
'll
find
me
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
put
Esquire
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
name
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Direct
to
me
,
you
know
,
at
Seth
Pecksniff
's
,
Esquire
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
Seth
Pecksniff
's
,
Esquire
,
"
repeated
Mr
Tigg
,
taking
an
exact
note
of
it
with
a
stump
of
pencil
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
said
this
week
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
or
Monday
will
do
,
"
observed
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Monday
will
NOT
do
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
we
stipulated
for
this
week
,
Saturday
is
the
latest
day
.
 
<EOS>
Did
we
stipulate
for
this
week
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Since
you
are
so
particular
about
it
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
think
we
did
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
added
this
condition
to
his
memorandum
;
read
the
entry
over
to
himself
with
a
severe
frown
;
and
that
the
transaction
might
be
the
more
correct
and
business
-
like
,
appended
his
initials
to
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
assured
Mr
Pinch
that
everything
was
now
perfectly
regular
;
and
,
after
squeezing
his
hand
with
great
fervour
,
departed
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
entertained
enough
suspicion
that
Martin
might
possibly
turn
this
interview
into
a
jest
,
to
render
him
desirous
to
avoid
the
company
of
that
young
gentleman
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
took
a
few
turns
up
and
down
the
skittle
-
ground
,
and
did
not
re
-
enter
the
house
until
Mr
Tigg
and
his
friend
had
quitted
it
,
and
the
new
pupil
and
Mark
were
watching
their
departure
from
one
of
the
windows
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
a
-
saying
,
sir
,
that
if
one
could
live
by
it
,
"
observed
Mark
,
pointing
after
their
late
guests
,
"
that
would
be
the
sort
of
service
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Waiting
on
such
individuals
as
them
would
be
better
than
grave
-
digging
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
staying
here
would
be
better
than
either
,
Mark
,
"
replied
Tom
.
"
<EOS>
So
take
my
advice
,
and
continue
to
swim
easily
in
smooth
water
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
too
late
to
take
it
now
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
broke
it
to
her
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
off
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Off
!
"
cried
Mr
Pinch
,
"
where
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
up
to
London
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
to
be
?
"
asked
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
yet
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
turned
up
<EOS>
that
day
I
opened
my
mind
to
you
,
as
was
at
all
likely
to
suit
me
.
 
<EOS>
All
them
trades
I
thought
of
<EOS>
was
a
deal
too
jolly
<EOS>
;
there
was
no
credit
at
all
to
be
got
in
any
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
look
for
a
private
service
,
I
suppose
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
be
brought
out
strong
,
perhaps
,
in
a
serious
family
,
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
might
come
out
rather
too
strong
for
a
serious
family
's
taste
,
Mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
possible
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
get
into
a
wicked
family
,
I
might
do
myself
justice
;
but
the
difficulty
is
to
make
sure
of
one
's
ground
,
because
a
young
man
ca
n't
very
well
advertise
that
he
wants
a
place
,
and
wages
an't
so
much
an
object
as
a
wicked
sitivation
;
can
he
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
"
I
do
n't
think
he
can
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
An
envious
family
,
"
pursued
Mark
,
with
a
thoughtful
face
;
"
or
a
quarrelsome
family
,
or
a
malicious
family
,
or
even
a
good
out
-
and
-
out
mean
family
,
<EOS>
would
open
a
field
of
action
as
I
might
do
something
in
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
as
would
have
suited
me
of
all
other
men
<EOS>
was
that
old
gentleman
as
was
took
ill
here
,
for
he
really
was
a
trying
customer
.
 
<EOS>
Howsever
,
I
must
wait
and
see
what
turns
up
,
sir
;
and
hope
for
the
worst
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
determined
to
go
then
?
"
said
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
box
is
gone
already
,
sir
,
by
the
waggon
,
and
I
'm
going
to
walk
on
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
get
a
lift
by
the
day
coach
when
it
overtakes
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
wish
you
good
-
bye
,
Mr
Pinch
---
and
you
too
,
sir
---
 
and
all
good
luck
and
happiness
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
both
returned
his
greeting
laughingly
,
and
walked
home
arm
-
in
-
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
imparting
to
his
new
friend
,
as
they
went
,
such
further
particulars
of
Mark
Tapley
's
whimsical
restlessness
as
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
with
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mark
,
having
a
shrewd
notion
that
his
mistress
was
in
very
low
spirits
,
and
that
he
could
not
exactly
answer
for
the
consequences
of
any
lengthened
TETE
-
A
-
TETE
in
the
bar
,
kept
himself
obstinately
out
of
her
way
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
piece
of
generalship
he
was
very
much
assisted
by
the
great
influx
of
company
into
the
taproom
;
for
the
news
of
his
intention
having
gone
abroad
,
there
was
a
perfect
throng
there
all
the
evening
,
and
much
drinking
of
healths
and
clinking
of
mugs
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
house
was
closed
for
the
night
;
and
there
being
now
no
help
for
it
<EOS>
,
Mark
put
the
best
face
he
could
upon
the
matter
,
and
walked
doggedly
to
the
bar
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
look
at
her
,
"
said
Mark
to
himself
,
"
I
'm
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
'm
a
-
going
fast
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
at
last
,
"
said
Mrs
Lupin
.
   
<EOS>
Aye
,
Mark
said
:
There
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
are
determined
to
leave
us
,
Mark
?
"
cried
Mrs
Lupin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
;
I
am
,
"
said
Mark
;
keeping
his
eyes
hard
upon
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
pursued
the
landlady
,
with
a
most
engaging
hesitation
,
"
that
you
had
been
---
fond
---
of
the
Dragon
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
am
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
pursued
the
hostess
---
and
it
really
was
not
an
unnatural
inquiry
---
"
why
do
you
desert
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
as
he
gave
no
manner
of
answer
to
this
question
;
not
even
on
its
being
repeated
;
Mrs
Lupin
put
his
money
into
his
hand
,
and
asked
him
---
not
unkindly
,
quite
the
contrary
---
what
he
would
take
?
   
<EOS>
It
is
proverbial
that
there
are
certain
things
which
flesh
and
blood
can
not
bear
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
question
as
this
,
propounded
in
such
a
manner
,
at
such
a
time
,
and
by
such
a
person
,
proved
(
at
least
,
as
far
as
,
Mark
's
flesh
and
blood
were
concerned
)
to
be
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
up
in
spite
of
himself
directly
;
and
having
once
looked
up
,
there
was
no
looking
down
again
;
for
of
all
the
tight
,
plump
,
buxom
,
bright
-
eyed
,
dimple
-
faced
landladies
that
ever
shone
on
earth
,
there
stood
before
him
then
,
bodily
in
that
bar
,
the
very
pink
and
pineapple
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
tell
you
what
,
"
said
Mark
,
throwing
off
all
his
constraint
in
an
instant
and
seizing
the
hostess
round
the
waist
---
at
which
she
was
not
at
all
alarmed
,
for
she
knew
what
a
good
young
man
he
was
---
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
took
what
I
liked
most
,
I
should
take
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
only
thought
what
was
best
for
me
,
I
should
take
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
took
what
nineteen
young
fellows
in
twenty
would
be
glad
to
take
,
and
would
take
at
any
price
,
I
should
take
you
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
should
,
"
cried
Mr
Tapley
,
shaking
his
head
expressively
enough
,
and
looking
(
in
a
momentary
state
of
forgetfulness
)
rather
hard
at
the
hostess
's
ripe
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
no
man
would
n't
wonder
if
I
did
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
said
he
amazed
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
astonished
how
he
could
say
such
things
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
never
thought
it
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
never
thought
if
of
myself
till
now
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mark
,
raising
his
eyebrows
with
a
look
of
the
merriest
possible
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
expected
we
should
part
,
and
never
have
no
explanation
;
I
meant
to
do
it
when
I
come
in
here
just
now
;
but
there
's
something
about
you
,
as
makes
a
man
sensible
.
 
<EOS>
Then
let
us
have
a
word
or
two
together
;
letting
it
be
understood
beforehand
,
"
he
added
this
in
a
grave
tone
,
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
mistake
,
"
that
I
'm
not
a
-
going
to
make
no
love
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
for
just
one
second
a
shade
,
though
not
by
any
means
a
dark
one
,
on
the
landlady
's
open
brow
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
passed
off
instantly
,
in
a
laugh
that
came
from
her
very
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
good
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
;
"
if
there
is
to
be
no
love
-
making
,
you
had
better
take
your
arm
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
why
should
I
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
innocent
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
's
innocent
,
"
returned
the
hostess
,
"
or
I
should
n't
allow
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
!
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
let
it
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
so
much
reason
in
this
that
the
landlady
laughed
again
,
suffered
it
to
remain
,
and
bade
<EOS>
him
say
what
he
had
to
say
,
and
be
quick
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
an
impudent
fellow
,
she
added
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
almost
think
I
am
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
,
"
though
I
never
thought
so
before
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
can
say
anything
to
-
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
what
you
're
going
to
say
if
you
please
,
and
be
quick
,
"
returned
the
landlady
,
"
for
I
want
to
get
to
bed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
my
dear
good
soul
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
and
a
kinder
woman
than
you
are
never
drawed
breath
<EOS>
---
let
me
see
the
man
as
says
she
did
!
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
what
would
be
the
likely
consequence
of
us
two
being
---
"
   
"
Oh
nonsense
!
"
cried
Mrs
Lupin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
about
that
any
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
<EOS>
but
it
an't
nonsense
,
"
said
Mark
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
wish
you
'd
attend
.
<EOS>
What
would
be
the
likely
consequence
of
us
two
being
married
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
ca
n't
be
content
and
comfortable
in
this
here
lively
Dragon
now
,
is
it
to
be
looked
for
as
I
should
be
then
?
 
<EOS>
By
no
means
.
 
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
Then
you
,
even
with
your
good
humour
,
would
be
always
on
the
fret
and
worrit
,
always
uncomfortable
in
your
own
mind
,
always
a
-
thinking
as
you
was
getting
too
old
for
my
taste
,
always
a
-
picturing
me
to
yourself
as
being
chained
up
to
the
Dragon
door
,
and
wanting
to
break
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
it
would
be
so
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
know
that
it
might
n't
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
roving
sort
of
chap
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
'm
fond
of
change
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
always
a
-
thinking
that
with
my
good
health
and
spirits
it
would
be
more
creditable
in
me
to
be
jolly
where
there
's
things
a
-
going
on
to
make
one
dismal
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
mistake
of
mine
you
see
,
but
nothing
short
of
trying
how
it
acts
will
set
it
right
.
 
<EOS>
Then
an't
it
best
that
I
should
go
;
particular
when
your
free
way
has
helped
me
out
to
say
all
this
,
and
we
can
part
as
good
friends
as
we
have
ever
been
since
first
<EOS>
I
entered
this
here
noble
Dragon
,
<EOS>
which
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
in
conclusion
,
"
has
my
good
word
and
my
good
wish
to
the
day
of
my
death
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
hostess
sat
quite
silent
for
a
little
time
,
but
she
very
soon
put
both
her
hands
in
Mark
's
and
shook
them
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
you
are
a
good
man
,
"
she
said
;
looking
into
his
face
with
a
smile
,
which
was
rather
serious
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
believe
have
been
a
better
friend
to
me
to
-
night
than
ever
I
have
had
in
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
that
's
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
But
love
my
heart
alive
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
looking
at
her
in
a
sort
of
rapture
,
"
if
you
ARE
<EOS>
that
way
disposed
,
<EOS>
what
a
lot
of
suitable
husbands
there
is
as
you
may
drive
distracted
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
laughed
again
at
this
compliment
;
and
,
once
more
shaking
him
by
both
hands
,
and
bidding
him
,
if
he
should
ever
want
a
friend
,
to
remember
her
,
turned
gaily
from
the
little
bar
and
up
the
Dragon
staircase
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humming
a
tune
as
she
goes
,
"
said
Mark
,
listening
,
"
in
case
<EOS>
I
should
think
she
's
at
all
put
out
,
and
should
be
made
down
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
Come
,
here
's
some
credit
in
being
jolly
,
at
last
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
piece
of
comfort
,
very
ruefully
uttered
,
he
went
,
in
anything
but
a
jolly
manner
,
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
He
rose
early
next
morning
,
and
was
a
-
foot
soon
after
sunrise
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
of
no
use
;
the
whole
place
was
up
to
see
Mark
Tapley
off
;
the
boys
,
the
dogs
,
the
children
,
the
old
men
,
the
busy
people
and
the
idlers
;
there
they
were
,
all
calling
out
"
Good
-
b'ye
,
Mark
,
"
after
their
own
manner
,
and
all
sorry
he
was
going
.
 
<EOS>
Somehow
he
had
a
kind
of
sense
that
his
old
mistress
was
peeping
from
her
chamber
-
window
,
but
he
could
n't
make
up
his
mind
to
look
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
b'ye
one
,
good

b'ye
all

"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
,
waving
his
hat
on
the
top
of
his
walking
-
stick
,
as
he
strode
at
a
quick
pace
up
the
little
street
.

Chapter
08
.
<EOS>
Accompanies
Mr
Pecksniff
and
his
charming
daughters
to
the
city
of
London
;
and
relates
what
fell
out
upon
their
way
<EOS>
thither
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Pecksniff
and
the
two
young
ladies
got
into
the
heavy
coach
at
the
end
of
the
lane
,
they
found
it
empty
,
which
was
a
great
comfort
;
particularly
as
the
outside
was
quite
full
and
the
passengers
looked
very
frosty
.
 
<EOS>
For
as
Mr
Pecksniff
justly
observed
 
---
when
he
and
his
daughters
had
burrowed
their
feet
deep
in
the
straw
,
wrapped
themselves
to
the
chin
,
and
pulled
up
both
windows
---
 
<EOS>
it
is
always
satisfactory
to
feel
,
in
keen
weather
,
that
many
other
people
are
not
as
warm
as
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
,
he
said
,
was
quite
natural
,
and
a
very
beautiful
arrangement
;
not
confined
to
coaches
,
but
extending
itself
into
many
social
ramifications
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
"
(
he
observed
)
,
"
if
every
one
were
warm
and
well
-
fed
,
we
should
lose
the
satisfaction
of
admiring
the
fortitude
with
which
certain
conditions
of
men
bear
cold
and
hunger
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
we
were
no
better
off
than
anybody
else
,
what
would
become
of
our
sense
of
gratitude
;
which
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
as
he
shook
his
fist
at
a
beggar
who
wanted
to
get
up
behind
,
"
is
one
of
the
holiest
feelings
of
our
common
nature
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
children
heard
with
becoming
reverence
these
moral
precepts
from
the
lips
of
their
father
,
and
signified
their
acquiescence
in
the
same
,
by
smiles
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
might
the
better
feed
and
cherish
<EOS>
that
sacred
flame
of
gratitude
in
his
breast
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pecksniff
remarked
that
he
would
trouble
his
eldest
daughter
,
even
in
this
early
stage
of
their
journey
,
for
the
brandy
-
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
And
from
the
narrow
neck
of
that
stone
vessel
he
imbibed
a
copious
refreshment
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
we
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
but
coaches
?
 
<EOS>
Some
of
us
are
slow
coaches
"
---
    
"
Goodness
,
Pa
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Some
of
us
,
I
say
,
"
resumed
her
parent
with
increased
emphasis
,
"
are
slow
coaches
;
some
of
us
are
fast
coaches
.
 
<EOS>
Our
passions
are
the
horses
;
and
rampant
animals
too
---
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Pa
,
"
cried
both
the
daughters
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
very
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
rampant
animals
too
"
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
with
so
much
determination
,
that
he
may
be
said
to
have
exhibited
,
at
the
moment
a
sort
of
moral
rampancy
himself
;
"
---
and
Virtue
is
the
drag
.
 
<EOS>
We
start
from
The
Mother
's
Arms
,
and
we
run
to
The
Dust
Shovel
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
said
this
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
being
exhausted
,
took
some
further
refreshment
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
that
,
he
corked
the
bottle
tight
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
effectually
corked
the
subject
also
;
and
went
to
sleep
for
three
stages
.
   
<EOS>
The
tendency
of
mankind
when
it
falls
asleep
in
coaches
,
is
to
wake
up
cross
;
to
find
its
legs
in
its
way
;
and
its
corns
an
aggravation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
not
being
exempt
from
the
common
lot
of
humanity
found
himself
,
at
the
end
of
his
nap
,
so
decidedly
the
victim
of
these
infirmities
,
that
he
had
an
irresistible
inclination
to
visit
them
upon
his
daughters
;
which
he
had
already
begun
to
do
in
the
shape
of
divers
random
kicks
,
and
other
unexpected
motions
of
his
shoes
,
when
the
coach
stopped
,
and
after
a
short
delay
the
door
was
opened
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
mind
,
"
said
a
thin
sharp
voice
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
and
my
son
go
inside
,
because
the
roof
is
full
,
but
you
agree
only
to
charge
us
outside
prices
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
quite
understood
that
we
wo
n't
pay
more
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
guard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
inside
now
?
"
inquired
the
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Three
passengers
,
"
returned
the
guard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
ask
the
three
passengers
to
witness
this
bargain
,
if
they
will
be
so
good
,
"
said
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
boy
,
I
think
we
may
safely
get
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
which
opinion
,
two
people
took
their
seats
in
the
vehicle
,
which
was
solemnly
licensed
by
Act
of
Parliament
to
carry
any
six
persons
who
could
be
got
in
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
lucky
!
<EOS>
"
whispered
the
old
man
,
when
they
moved
on
again
.
"
<EOS>
And
a
great
stroke
of
policy
in
you
to
observe
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
he
,
he
!
 
<EOS>
We
could
n't
have
gone
outside
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
died
of
the
rheumatism
!
"
   
<EOS>
Whether
it
occurred
to
the
dutiful
son
that
he
had
in
some
degree
over
-
reached
himself
by
contributing
to
the
prolongation
of
his
father
's
days
;
or
whether
the
cold
had
effected
his
temper
;
is
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
gave
his
father
such
a
nudge
in
reply
,
that
that
good
old
gentleman
was
taken
with
a
cough
which
lasted
for
full
five
minutes
without
intermission
,
and
goaded
Mr
Pecksniff
to
that
pitch
of
irritation
,
that
he
said
at
last
---
and
very
suddenly
:
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
room
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
really
no
room
in
this
coach
for
any
gentleman
with
a
cold
in
his
head
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mine
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
is
upon
my
chest
,
Pecksniff
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
voice
and
manner
,
together
,
now
that
he
spoke
out
;
the
composure
of
the
speaker
;
the
presence
of
his
son
;
and
his
knowledge
of
Mr
Pecksniff
;
afforded
a
clue
to
his
identity
which
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
<EOS>
I
thought
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
returning
to
his
usual
mildness
,
"
that
I
addressed
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
I
address
a
relative

,
Mr
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
and
his
son
Mr
Jonas
---
for
they
,
my
dear
children

are

travelling
companions

will
excuse
me
for
an
apparently
harsh
remark
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
MY
desire
to
wound
the
feelings
of
any
person
with
whom
I
am
connected
in
family
bonds
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
a
Hypocrite
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
cuttingly
;
"
but
I
am
not
a
Brute
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
!
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
signifies
that
word
,
Pecksniff
?
 
<EOS>
Hypocrite
!
<EOS>
why
,
we
are
all
hypocrites
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
all
hypocrites
t'other
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
felt
that
to
be
agreed
upon
among
us
,
or
I
should
n't
have
called
you
one
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
not
have
been
there
at
all
,
if
we
had
not
been
hypocrites
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
difference
between
you
and
the
rest
was
---
<EOS>
shall
I
tell
you
the
difference
between
you
and
the
rest
now
,
Pecksniff
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
please
,
my
good
sir
;
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
annoying
quality
in
YOU
,
is
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
that
you
never
have
a
confederate
or
partner
in
YOUR
juggling
;
you
would
deceive
everybody
,
even
those
who
practise
the
same
art
;
and
have
a
way
with
you
,
as
if
you
---
he
,
he
,
he
!
<EOS>
---
as
if
you
really
believed
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
lay
a
handsome
wager
now
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
if
I
laid
wagers
,
which
I
do
n't
and
never
did
,
that
you
keep
up
appearances
by
a
tacit
understanding
,
even
before
your
own
daughters
here
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
,
when
I
have
a
business
scheme
in
hand
,
tell
Jonas
what
it
is
,
and
we
discuss
it
openly
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
not
offended
,
Pecksniff
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Offended
,
my
good
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
that
gentleman
,
as
if
he
had
received
the
highest
compliments
that
language
could
convey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
travelling
to
London
,
Mr
Pecksniff
?
"
asked
the
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mr
Jonas
,
we
are
travelling
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
all
the
way
,
I
trust
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
ecod
,
you
had
better
ask
father
<EOS>
that
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
-
going
to
commit
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
greatly
entertained
by
this
retort
.
 
<EOS>
His
mirth
having
subsided
,
Mr
Jonas
gave
him
to
understand
that
himself
and
parent
were
in
fact
travelling
to
their
home
in
the
metropolis
;
and
that
,
since
the
memorable
day
of
the
great
family
gathering
,
they
had
been
tarrying
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
watching
the
sale
of
certain
eligible
investments
,
which
they
had
had
in
their
copartnership
eye
when
they
came
down
;
for
it
was
their
custom
,
Mr
Jonas
said
,
whenever
such
a
thing
was
practicable
,
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
,
and
never
to
throw
away
sprats
,
but
as
bait
for
whales
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
communicated
to
Mr
Pecksniff
these
pithy
scraps
of
intelligence
,
he
said
,
"
That
if
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
,
he
would
turn
him
over
to
father
,
and
have
a
chat
with
the
gals
;
"
and
in
furtherance
of
this
polite
scheme
,
he
vacated
his
seat
adjoining
that
gentleman
,
and
established
himself
in
the
opposite
corner
,
next
to
the
fair
Miss
Mercy
.
   
<EOS>
The
education
of
Mr
Jonas
had
been
conducted
from
his
cradle
on
the
strictest
principles
of
the
main
chance
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
first
word
he
learnt
to
spell
was
"
gain
,
"
and
the
second
(
when
he
got
into
two
syllables
)
,
"
money
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
for
two
results
,
which
were
not
clearly
foreseen
perhaps
by
his
watchful
parent
in
the
beginning
,
his
training
may
be
said
to
have
been
unexceptionable
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
flaws
was
,
that
having
been
long
taught
by
his
father
to
over
-
reach
everybody
,
he
had
imperceptibly
acquired
a
love
of
over
-
reaching
that
venerable
monitor
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
,
that
from
his
early
habits
of
considering
everything
as
a
question
of
property
,
he
had
gradually
come
to
look
,
with
impatience
,
on
his
parent
as
a
certain
amount
of
personal
estate
,
which
had
no
right
whatever
to
be
going
at
large
,
but
ought
to
be
secured
in
that
particular
description
of
iron
safe
which
is
commonly
called
a
coffin
,
and
banked
in
the
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
cousin
!
"
said
Mr
Jonas
---
"
Because
we
ARE
cousins
,
you
know
,
a
few
times
removed
<EOS>
---
so
you
're
going
to
London
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mercy
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
pinching
her
sister
's
arm
at
the
same
time
,
and
giggling
excessively
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lots
of
beaux
in
London
,
cousin
!
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
slightly
advancing
his
elbow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
!
"
cried
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
wo
n't
hurt
us
,
sir
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
having
given
him
this
answer
with
great
demureness
<EOS>
she
was
so
overcome
by
her
own
humour
,
that
she
was
fain
to
stifle
her
merriment
in
her
sister
's
shawl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Merry
,
"
cried
that
more
prudent
damsel
,
"
<EOS>
really
I
am
ashamed
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
go
on
so
?
 
<EOS>
You
wild
thing
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
which
Miss
Merry
only
laughed
the
more
,
of
course
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
a
wildness
in
her
eye
,
t'other
day
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
addressing
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
're
the
one
to
sit
solemn
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
---
<EOS>
You
were
regularly
prim
,
cousin
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
The
old
-
fashioned
fright
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Merry
,
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cherry
my
dear
,
upon
my
word
you
must
sit
next
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
die
outright
if
he
talks
to
me
any
more
;
I
shall
,
positively
!
"
 
<EOS>
To
prevent
which
fatal
consequence
,
the
buoyant
creature
skipped
out
of
her
seat
as
she
spoke
,
and
squeezed
her
sister
into
the
place
from
which
she
had
risen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
crowding
me
,
"
cried
Mr
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
be
crowded
by
gals
.
 
<EOS>
Come
a
little
closer
,
cousin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
that
other
one
a
-
laughing
again
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
;
"
she
's
a
-
laughing
at
my
father
,
I
should
n't
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
puts
on
that
old
flannel
nightcap
of
his
,
I
do
n't
know
what
she
'll
do
!
 
<EOS>
Is
that
my
father
a
-
snoring
,
Pecksniff
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr
Jonas
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tread
upon
his
foot
,
will
you
be
so
good
?
"
said
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
foot
next
<EOS>
you
's
the
gouty
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
hesitating
to
perform
this
friendly
office
,
Mr
Jonas
did
it
himself
;
at
the
same
time
crying
<EOS>
:
   
"
Come
,
wake
up
,
father
,
or
you
'll
be
having
the
nightmare
,
and
screeching
out
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
---
Do
you
ever
have
the
nightmare
,
cousin
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
his
neighbour
,
with
characteristic
gallantry
,
as
he
dropped
his
voice
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
,
"
answered
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
often
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
other
one
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Does
SHE
ever
have
the
nightmare
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
ask
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
laughs
so
,
"
said
Jonas
;
<EOS>
"
there
's
no
talking
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Only
hark
how
she
's
a
-
going
on
now
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
the
sensible
one
,
cousin
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mercy
is
a
little
giddy
,
"
said
Miss
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
'll
sober
down
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
a
very
long
time
,
then
,
if
she
does
at
all
,
"
rejoined
her
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
little
more
room
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
of
crowding
you
,
"
said
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
took
it
notwithstanding
;
and
after
one
or
two
remarks
on
the
extreme
heaviness
of
the
coach
,
and
the
number
of
places
it
stopped
at
,
they
fell
into
a
silence
which
remained
unbroken
by
any
member
of
the
party
until
supper
-
time
.
   
<EOS>
Although
Mr
Jonas
conducted
Charity
to
the
hotel
and
sat
himself
beside
her
at
the
board
,
it
was
pretty
clear
that
he
had
an
eye
to
"
the
other
one
"
also
,
for
he
often
glanced
across
at
Mercy
,
and
seemed
to
draw
comparisons
between
the
personal
appearance
of
the
two
,
which
were
not
unfavourable
to
the
superior
plumpness
of
the
younger
sister
.
 
<EOS>
He
allowed
himself
no
great
leisure
for
this
kind
of
observation
,
however
,
being
busily
engaged
with
the
supper
,
which
,
as
he
whispered
in
his
fair
companion
's
ear
,
was
a
contract
business
,
and
therefore
the
more
she
ate
,
the
better
the
bargain
was
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
and
Mr
Pecksniff
,
probably
acting
on
the
same
wise
principle
,
demolished
everything
that
came
within
their
reach
,
and
by
that
means
acquired
a
greasy
expression
of
countenance
,
indicating
contentment
,
if
not
repletion
,
which
it
was
very
pleasant
to
contemplate
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
could
eat
no
more
,
Mr
Pecksniff
and
Mr
Jonas
subscribed
for
two
sixpenny
-
worths
of
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
which
the
latter
gentleman
considered
a
more
politic
order
than
one
shillingsworth
;
there
being
a
chance
of
their
getting
more
spirit
out
of
the
innkeeper
under
this
arrangement
than
if
it
were
all
in
one
glass
.
<EOS>
Having
swallowed
his
share
of
the
enlivening
fluid
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
under
pretence
of
going
to
see
if
the
coach
were
ready
,
went
secretly
to
the
bar
,
and
had
his
own
little
bottle
filled
,
in
order
that
he
might
refresh
himself
at
leisure
in
the
dark
coach
without
being
observed
.
   
<EOS>
These
arrangements
concluded
,
and
the
coach
being
ready
,
they
got
into
their
old
places
and
jogged
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
he
composed
himself
for
a
nap
,
Mr
Pecksniff
delivered
a
kind
of
grace
after
meat
,
in
these
words
:
   
"
<EOS>
The
process
of
digestion
,
as
I
have
been
informed
by
anatomical
friends
,
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
works
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
with
others
,
but
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
,
when
regaling
on
my
humble
fare
,
that
I
am
putting
in
motion
the
most
beautiful
machinery
with
which
we
have
any
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
feel
at
such
times
as
if
I
was
doing
a
public
service
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
have
wound
myself
up
,
if
I
may
employ
such
a
term
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
with
exquisite
tenderness
,
"
and
know
that
I
am
Going
<EOS>
,
I
feel
that
in
the
lesson
afforded
by
the
works
within
me
,
I
am
a
Benefactor
to
my
Kind
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
nothing
could
be
added
to
this
,
nothing
was
said
;
and
Mr
Pecksniff
,
exulting
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
presumed
,
in
his
moral
utility
,
went
to
sleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
night
wore
away
in
the
usual
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
and
Old
Anthony
kept
tumbling
against
each
other
and
waking
up
much
terrified
,
or
crushed
their
heads
in
opposite
corners
of
the
coach
and
strangely
tattooed
the
surface
of
their
faces
---
Heaven
knows
how
 
---
in
their
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
stopped
and
went
on
,
and
went
on
and
stopped
,
times
out
of
number
.
 
<EOS>
Passengers
got
up
and
passengers
got
down
,
and
fresh
horses
came
and
went
and
came
again
,
with
scarcely
any
interval
between
each
team
as
it
seemed
to
those
who
were
dozing
,
and
with
a
gap
of
a
whole
night
between
every
one
as
it
seemed
to
those
who
were
broad
awake
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
they
began
to
jolt
and
rumble
over
horribly
uneven
stones
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
looking
out
of
window
said
it
was
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
they
were
there
.
   
<EOS>
Very
soon
afterwards
the
coach
stopped
at
the
office
in
the
city
;
and
the
street
in
which
it
was
situated
was
already
in
a
bustle
,
that
fully
bore
out
Mr
Pecksniff
's
words
about
its
being
morning
,
though
for
any
signs
of
day
yet
appearing
in
the
sky
it
might
have
been
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
dense
fog
too
;
as
if
it
were
a
city
in
the
clouds
,
which
they
had
been
travelling
to
all
night
up
a
magic
beanstalk
;
and
there
was
a
thick
crust
upon
the
pavement
like
oilcake
;
which
,
one
of
the
outsides
(
mad
,
no
doubt
)
said
to
another
(
his
keeper
,
of
course
)
,
was
Snow
.
   
<EOS>
Taking
a
confused
leave
of
Anthony
and
his
son
,
and
leaving
the
luggage
of
himself
and
daughters
at
the
office
to
be
called
for
afterwards
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
one
of
the
young
ladies
under
each
arm
,
dived
across
the
street
,
and
then
across
other
streets
,
and
so
up
the
queerest
courts
,
and
down
the
strangest
alleys
and
under
the
blindest
archways
,
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
;
now
skipping
over
a
kennel
,
now
running
for
his
life
from
a
coach
and
horses
;
now
thinking
he
had
lost
his
way
,
now
thinking
he
had
found
it
;
now
in
a
state
of
the
highest
confidence
,
now
despondent
to
the
last
degree
,
but
always
in
a
great
perspiration
and
flurry
;
until
at
length
they
stopped
in
a
kind
of
paved
yard
near
the
Monument
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
Mr
Pecksniff
told
them
so
;
for
as
to
anything
they
could
see
of
the
Monument
,
or
anything
else
but
the
buildings
close
at
hand
,
they
might
as
well
have
been
playing
blindman
's
buff
at
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
looked
about
him
for
a
moment
,
and
then
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
very
dingy
edifice
,
even
among
the
choice
collection
of
dingy
edifices
at
hand
;
on
the
front
of
which
was
a
little
oval
board
like
a
tea
-
tray
,
with
this
inscription
---
"
<EOS>
Commercial
Boarding
-
House
:
M
Todgers
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
M
Todgers
was
not
up
yet
,
for
Mr
Pecksniff
knocked
twice
and
rang
thrice
,
without
making
any
impression
on
anything
but
a
dog
over
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
a
chain
and
some
bolts
were
withdrawn
with
a
rusty
noise
,
as
if
the
weather
had
made
the
very
fastenings
hoarse
,
and
a
small
boy
with
a
large
red
head
,
and
no
nose
to
speak
of
,
and
a
very
dirty
Wellington
boot
on
his
left
arm
,
appeared
;
who
(
being
surprised
)
rubbed
the
nose
just
mentioned
with
the
back
of
a
shoe
-
brush
,
and
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Still
a
-
bed
my
man
?
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Still
a
-
bed
!
"
replied
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
they
wos
still
a
-
bed
.
<EOS>
They
're
very
noisy
a
-
bed
;
all
calling
for
their
boots
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
was
the
Paper
,
and
wondered
why
you
did
n't
shove
yourself
through
the
grating
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
?
"
   
<EOS>
Considering
his
years
,
which
were
tender
,
the
youth
may
be
said
to
have
preferred
this
question
sternly
,
and
in
something
of
a
defiant
manner
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pecksniff
,
without
taking
umbrage
at
his
bearing
put
a
card
in
his
hand
,
and
bade
him
take
that
upstairs
,
and
show
them
in
the
meanwhile
into
a
room
where
there
was
a
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
if
there
's
one
in
the
eating
parlour
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
I
can
find
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
he
led
his
daughters
,
without
waiting
for
any
further
introduction
,
into
a
room
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
where
a
table
-
cloth
(
rather
a
tight
and
scanty
fit
in
reference
to
the
table
it
covered
)
was
already
spread
for
breakfast
;
displaying
a
mighty
dish
of
pink
boiled
beef
;
an
instance
of
that
particular
style
of
loaf
which
is
known
to
housekeepers
as
a
slack
-
baked
,
crummy
quartern
;
a
liberal
provision
of
cups
and
saucers
;
and
the
usual
appendages
.
   
<EOS>
Inside
the
fender
were
<EOS>
some
half
-
dozen
pairs
of
shoes
and
boots
,
of
various
sizes
,
just
cleaned
and
turned
with
the
soles
upwards
to
dry
;
and
a
pair
of
short
black
gaiters
,
on
one
of
which
was
chalked
 
---
in
sport
,
it
would
appear
,
by
some
gentleman
who
had
slipped
down
for
the
purpose
,
pending
his
toilet
,
and
gone
up
again
---
"
Jinkins
's
Particular
,
"
while
the
other
exhibited
a
sketch
in
profile
,
claiming
to
be
the
portrait
of
Jinkins
himself
.
   
<EOS>
M
Todgers
's
Commercial
Boarding
-
House
was
a
house
of
that
sort
which
is
likely
to
be
dark
at
any
time
;
but
that
morning
it
was
especially
dark
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
odd
smell
in
the
passage
,
as
if
the
concentrated
essence
of
all
the
dinners
that
had
been
cooked
in
the
kitchen
since
the
house
was
built
,
lingered
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
to
that
hour
,
and
like
the
Black
Friar
in
Don
Juan
,
"
would
n't
be
driven
away
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
particular
,
there
was
a
sensation
of
cabbage
;
as
if
all
the
greens
that
had
ever
been
boiled
there
,
were
evergreens
,
and
flourished
in
immortal
strength
.
 
<EOS>
The
parlour
was
wainscoted
,
and
communicated
to
strangers
a
magnetic
and
instinctive
consciousness
of
rats
and
mice
.
 
<EOS>
The
staircase
was
very
gloomy
and
very
broad
,
with
balustrades
so
thick
and
heavy
that
they
would
have
served
for
a
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
sombre
corner
on
the
first
landing
,
stood
a
gruff
old
giant
of
a
clock
,
with
a
preposterous
coronet
of
three
brass
balls
on
his
head
;
whom
few
had
ever
seen
---
none
ever
looked
in
the
face
---
and
who
seemed
to
continue
his
heavy
tick
for
no
other
reason
than
to
warn
heedless
people
from
running
into
him
accidentally
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
papered
or
painted
,
had
n't
Todgers
's
,
within
the
memory
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
black
,
begrimed
,
and
mouldy
.
<EOS>
And
,
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
,
was
an
old
,
disjointed
,
rickety
,
ill
-
favoured
skylight
,
patched
and
mended
in
all
kinds
of
ways
,
which
looked
distrustfully
down
at
everything
that
passed
below
,
and
covered
Todgers
's
up
as
if
it
were
a
sort
of
human
cucumber
-
frame
,
and
only
people
of
a
peculiar
growth
were
reared
there
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
and
his
fair
daughters
had
not
stood
warming
themselves
at
the
fire
ten
minutes
,
when
the
sound
of
feet
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
,
and
the
presiding
deity
of
the
establishment
came
hurrying
in
.
   
<EOS>
M
Todgers
was
a
lady
,
rather
a
bony
and
hard
-
featured
lady
,
with
a
row
of
curls
in
front
of
her
head
,
shaped
like
little
barrels
of
beer
;
and
on
the
top
of
it
something
made
of
net
---
you
could
n't
call
it
a
cap
exactly
---
which
looked
like
a
black
cobweb
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
little
basket
on
her
arm
,
and
in
it
a
bunch
of
keys
that
jingled
as
she
came
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
other
hand
she
bore
a
flaming
tallow
candle
,
which
,
after
surveying
Mr
Pecksniff
for
one
instant
by
its
light
,
she
put
down
upon
the
table
,
to
the
end
that
she
might
receive
him
with
the
greater
cordiality
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pecksniff
!
"
cried
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Welcome
to
London
!
 
<EOS>
Who
would
have
thought
of
such
a
visit
as
this
,
after
so
---
dear
,
dear
!
---
<EOS>
so
many
years
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
DO
,
Mr
Pecksniff
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
well
as
ever
;
<EOS>
and
as
glad
to
see
you
,
as
ever
;
"
Mr
Pecksniff
made
response
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
are
younger
than
you
used
to
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
are
,
I
am
sure
!
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
a
bit
changed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
to
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
stretching
out
his
hand
towards
the
young
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
"
Does
this
make
me
no
older
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
your
daughters
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
lady
,
raising
her
hands
and
clasping
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
Mr
Pecksniff
!
 
<EOS>
Your
second
,
and
her
bridesmaid
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
smiled
complacently
;
shook
his
head
;
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
My
daughters
,
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
Merely
my
daughters
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
sighed
the
good
lady
,
"
I
must
believe
you
,
for
now
I
look
at
'em
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
known
'em
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
how
happy
your
Pa
has
made
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
hugged
them
both
;
and
being
by
this
time
overpowered
by
her
feelings
or
the
inclemency
of
the
morning
,
jerked
a
little
pocket
handkerchief
out
of
the
little
basket
,
and
applied
the
same
to
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
good
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
I
know
the
rules
of
your
establishment
,
and
that
you
only
receive
gentlemen
boarders
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
occurred
to
me
,
when
I
left
home
,
that
perhaps
you
would
give
my
daughters
house
room
,
and
make
an
exception
in
their
favour
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
?
"
cried
Mrs
Todgers
ecstatically
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
?
"
   
"
I
may
say
then
,
that
I
was
sure
you
would
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
you
have
a
little
room
of
your
own
,
and
that
they
can
be
comfortable
there
,
without
appearing
at
the
general
table
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
girls
!
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
that
liberty
once
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
meant
by
this
that
she
must
embrace
them
once
more
,
which
she
accordingly
did
with
great
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
truth
was
that
the
house
being
full
with
the
exception
of
one
bed
,
which
would
now
be
occupied
by
Mr
Pecksniff
,
she
wanted
time
for
consideration
;
and
so
much
time
too
<EOS>
(
for
it
was
a
knotty
point
how
to
dispose
of
them
)
,
that
even
when
this
second
embrace
was
over
,
she
stood
for
some
moments
gazing
at
the
sisters
,
with
affection
beaming
in
one
eye
,
and
calculation
shining
out
of
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
how
to
arrange
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
sofa
bedstead
in
the
little
third
room
which
opens
from
my
own
parlour
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
dear
girls
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thereupon
she
embraced
them
once
more
,
observing
that
she
could
not
decide
which
was
most
like
their
poor
mother
(
which
was
highly
probable
,
seeing
that
she
had
never
beheld
that
lady
)
,
but
that
she
rather
thought
the
youngest
was
;
and
then
she
said
that
as
the
gentlemen
would
be
down
directly
,
and
the
ladies
were
fatigued
with
travelling
,
would
they
step
into
her
room
at
once
?
   
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
same
floor
;
being
,
in
fact
,
the
back
parlour
;
and
had
,
as
Mrs
Todgers
said
,
the
great
advantage
(
in
London
)
of
not
being
overlooked
;
as
they
would
see
when
the
fog
cleared
off
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
a
vainglorious
boast
,
for
it
commanded
at
a
perspective
of
two
feet
,
a
brown
wall
with
a
black
cistern
on
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
The
sleeping
apartment
designed
for
the
young
ladies
was
approached
from
this
chamber
by
a
mightily
convenient
little
door
,
which
would
only
open
when
fallen
against
by
a
strong
person
.
 
<EOS>
It
commanded
from
a
similar
point
of
sight
another
angle
of
the
wall
,
and
another
side
of
the
cistern
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
the
damp
side
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
THAT
is
Mr
Jinkins
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
first
of
these
sanctuaries
a
fire
was
speedily
kindled
by
the
youthful
porter
,
who
,
whistling
at
his
work
in
the
absence
of
Mrs
Todgers
(
not
to
mention
his
sketching
figures
on
his
corduroys
with
burnt
firewood
)
,
and
being
afterwards
taken
by
that
lady
in
the
fact
,
was
dismissed
with
a
box
on
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
Having
prepared
breakfast
for
the
young
ladies
with
her
own
hands
,
she
withdrew
to
preside
in
the
other
room
;
where
the
joke
at
Mr
Jinkins
's
expense
seemed
to
be
proceeding
rather
noisily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
ask
you
yet
,
my
dears
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
in
at
the
door
,
"
how
you
like
London
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
n't
seen
much
of
it
,
Pa

"
<EOS>
cried
Merry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Cherry
.
 
<EOS>
(
Both
very
miserably
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
that
's
true
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
our
pleasure

Whether
Mr
Pecksniff
's
business
in
London
was
as
strictly
professional
as
he
had
given
his
new
pupil

Town
and
Todger
's
 
<EOS>
Surely
there
never
was
,
in
any
other
borough
,
city
,
or
hamlet
in
the
world
,
such
a
singular
sort
of
a
place
as
Todgers
's
.
 
<EOS>
And
surely
London
,
to
judge
from
that
part
of
it
which
hemmed
Todgers
's
round
and
hustled
it
,
and
crushed
it
,
and
stuck
its
brick
-
and
-
mortar
elbows
into
it
,
and
kept
the
air
from
it
,
and
stood
perpetually
between
it
and
the
light
,
was
worthy
of
Todgers
's
,
and
qualified
to
be
on
terms
of
close
relationship
and
alliance
with
hundreds
and
thousands
of
the
odd
family
to
which
Todgers
's
belonged
.
   
<EOS>
You
could
n't
walk
about
Todgers
's
neighbourhood
,
as
you
could
in
any
other
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
You
groped
your
way
for
an
hour
through
lanes
and
byways
,
and
court
-
yards
,
and
passages
;
and
you
never
once
emerged
upon
anything
that
might
be
reasonably
called
a
street
.
 
<EOS>
A
kind
of
resigned
distraction
came
over
the
stranger
as
he
trod
those
devious
mazes
,
and
,
giving
himself
up
for
lost
,
went
in
and
out
and
round
about
and
quietly
turned
back
again
when
he
came
to
a
dead
wall
or
was
stopped
by
an
iron
railing
,
and
felt
that
the
means
of
escape
might
possibly
present
themselves
in
their
own
good
time
,
but
that
to
anticipate
them
was
hopeless

Instances
were
known
of
people

being
asked
to
dine
at
Todgers
's
,
had
travelled
round
and
round
for
a
weary
time
,
with
its
very
chimney
-
pots
in
view
;
and
finding
it
,
at
last
,
impossible
of
attainment
,
had
gone
home
again
with
a
gentle
melancholy
on
their
spirits
,
tranquil
and
uncomplaining
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
had
ever
found
Todgers
's
on
a
verbal
direction
,
though
given
within
a
few
minutes
'
walk
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Cautious
emigrants
from
Scotland
or
the
North
of
England
had
been
known
to
reach
it
safely
,
by
impressing
a
charity
-
boy
,
town
-
bred
,
and
bringing
him
along
with
them
;
or
by
clinging
tenaciously
to
the
postman
;
but
these
were
rare
exceptions
,
and
only
went
to
prove
the
rule
that
Todgers
's
was
in
a
labyrinth
,
whereof
the
mystery
was
known
but
to
a
chosen
few
.
   
<EOS>
Several
fruit
-
brokers
had
their
marts
near
Todgers
's
;
and
one
of
the
first
impressions
wrought
upon
the
stranger
's
senses
was
of
oranges
 
---
of
damaged
oranges
---
with
blue
and
green
bruises
on
them
,
festering
in
boxes
,
or
mouldering
away
in
cellars
.
 
<EOS>
All
day
long
,
a
stream
of
porters
from
the
wharves
beside
the
river
,
each
bearing
on
his
back
a
bursting
chest
of
oranges
,
poured
slowly
through
the
narrow
passages
;
while
underneath
the
archway
by
the
public
-
house
,
the
knots
of
those
who
rested
and
regaled
within
,
were
piled
from
morning
until
night
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
solitary
pumps
were
found
near
Todgers
's
hiding
themselves
for
the
most
part
in
blind
alleys
,
and
keeping
company
with
fire
-
ladders
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
churches
also
by
dozens
,
with
many
a
ghostly
little
churchyard
,
all
overgrown
with
such
straggling
vegetation
as
springs
up
spontaneously
from
damp
,
and
graves
,
and
rubbish
.
 
<EOS>
In
some
of
these
dingy
resting
-
places
which
bore
much
the
same
analogy
to
green
churchyards
,
as
the
pots
of
earth
for
mignonette
and
wall
-
flower
in
the
windows
overlooking
them
did
to
rustic
gardens
,
there
were
trees
;
tall
trees
;
still
putting
forth
their
leaves
in
each
succeeding
year
,
with
such
a
languishing
remembrance
of
their
kind
(
so
one
might
fancy
,
looking
on
their
sickly
boughs
)
as
birds
in
cages
have
of
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
paralysed
old
watchmen
guarded
the
bodies
of
the
dead
at
night
,
year
after
year
,
until
at
last
they
joined
that
solemn
brotherhood
;
and
,
saving
that
they
slept
below
the
ground
a
sounder
sleep
than
even
they
had
ever
known
above
it
,
and
were
shut
up
in
another
kind
of
box
,
their
condition
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
undergone
any
material
change
when
they
,
in
turn
,
were
watched
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
narrow
thoroughfares
at
hand
,
there
lingered
,
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
an
ancient
doorway
of
carved
oak
,
from
which
,
of
old
,
the
sounds
of
revelry
and
feasting
often
came
;
but
now
these
mansions
,
only
used
for
storehouses
,
were
dark
and
dull
,
and
,
being
filled
with
wool
,
and
cotton
,
and
the
like
---
such
heavy
merchandise
as
stifles
sound
and
stops
the
throat
of
echo
---
had
an
air
of
palpable
deadness
about
them
which
,
added
to
their
silence
and
desertion
,
made
them
very
grim
.
 
<EOS>
In
like
manner
,
there
were
gloomy
courtyards
in
these
parts
,
<EOS>
into
which
few
but
belated
wayfarers
ever
strayed
,
and
where
vast
bags
and
packs
of
goods
,
upward
or
downward
bound
,
were
for
ever
dangling
between
heaven
and
earth
from
lofty
cranes
There
were
more
trucks
near
Todgers
's
than
you
would
suppose
whole
city
could
ever
need
;
not
active
trucks
,
but
a
vagabond
race
,
for
ever
lounging
in
the
narrow
lanes
before
their
masters
'
doors
and
stopping
up
the
pass
;
so
that
when
a
stray
hackney
-
coach
or
lumbering
waggon
came
that
way
,
they
were
the
cause
of
such
an
uproar
as
enlivened
the
whole
neighbourhood
,
and
made
the
bells
in
the
next
churchtower
vibrate
again
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
throats
and
maws
of
dark
no
-
thoroughfares
near
Todgers
's
,
individual
wine
-
merchants
and
wholesale
dealers
in
grocery
-
ware
had
perfect
little
towns
of
their
own
;
and
,
deep
among
the
foundations
of
these
buildings
,
the
ground
was
undermined
and
burrowed
out
into
stables
,
where
cart
-
horses
,
troubled
by
rats
,
might
be
heard
on
a
quiet
Sunday
rattling
their
halters
,
as
disturbed
spirits
in
tales
of
haunted
houses
are
said
to
clank
their
chains
.
   
<EOS>
To
tell
of
half
the
queer
old
taverns
that
had
a
drowsy
and
secret
existence
near
Todgers
's
,
would
fill
a
goodly
book
;
while
a
second
volume
no
less
capacious
might
be
devoted
to
an
account
of
the
quaint
old
guests
who
frequented
their
dimly
lighted
parlours
.
<EOS>
These
were
,
in
general
,
ancient
inhabitants
of
that
region
;
born
,
and
bred
there
from
boyhood
.
 
<EOS>
who
had
long
since
become
wheezy
and
asthmatical
,
and
short
of
breath
,
except
in
the
article
of
story
-
telling
;
in
which
respect
they
were
still
marvellously
long
-
winded
.
<EOS>
These
gentry
were
much
opposed
to
steam
and
all
new
-
fangled
ways
,
and
held
ballooning
to
be
sinful
,
and
deplored
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
;
which
that
particular
member
of
each
little
club
who
kept
the
keys
of
the
nearest
church
,
professionally
,
always
attributed
to
the
prevalence
of
dissent
and
irreligion
;
though
the
major
part
of
the
company
inclined
to
the
belief
that
virtue
went
out
with
hair
-
powder
,
and
that
Old
England
's
greatness
had
decayed
amain
with
barbers
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
Todgers
's
itself
---
speaking
of
it
only
as
a
house
in
that
neighbourhood
,
and
making
no
reference
to
its
merits
as
a
commercial
boarding
establishment
---
it
was
worthy
to
stand
where
it
did
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
staircase
-
window
in
it
,
at
the
side
of
the
house
,
on
the
ground
floor
;
which
tradition
said
had
not
been
opened
for
a
hundred
years
at
least
,
and
which
,
abutting
on
an
always
dirty
lane
,
was
so
begrimed
and
coated
with
a
century
's
mud
,
that
no
one
pane
of
glass
could
possibly
fall
out
,
though
all
were
cracked
and
broken
twenty
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
grand
mystery
of
Todgers
's
was
the
cellarage
<EOS>
,
approachable
only
by
a
little
back
door
and
a
rusty
grating
;
which
cellarage
within
the
memory
of
man
had
had
no
connection
with
the
house
,
but
had
always
been
the
freehold
property
of
somebody
else
,
and
was
reported
to
be
full
of
wealth
;
though
in
what
shape
---
whether
in
silver
,
brass
,
or
gold
,
or
butts
of
wine
,
or
casks
of
gun
-
powder
---
 
was
matter
of
profound
uncertainty
and
supreme
indifference
to
Todgers
's
and
all
its
inmates
.
   
<EOS>
The
top
of
the
house
was
worthy
of
notice
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sort
of
terrace
on
the
roof
,
with
posts
and
fragments
of
rotten
lines
,
once
intended
to
dry
clothes
upon
;
and
there
were
two
or
three
tea
-
chests
out
there
,
full
of
earth
,
with
forgotten
plants
in
them
,
like
old
walking
-
sticks
.
 
<EOS>
Whoever
climbed
to
this
observatory
,
was
stunned
at
first
from
having
knocked
his
head
against
the
little
door
in
coming
out
;
and
after
that
,
was
for
the
moment
choked
from
having
looked
perforce
,
straight
down
the
kitchen
chimney
;
but
these
two
stages
over
,
there
were
things
to
gaze
at
from
the
top
of
Todgers
's
,
<EOS>
well
worth
your
seeing
too
.
 
<EOS>
For
first
and
foremost
,
if
the
day
were
bright
,
you
observed
upon
the
house
-
tops
,
stretching
far
away
,
a
long
dark
path
;
the
shadow
of
the
Monument
;
and
turning
round
,
the
tall
original
was
close
beside
you
,
with
every
hair
erect
upon
his
golden
head
,
as
if
the
doings
of
the
city
frightened
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
were
steeples
,
towers
,
belfries
,
shining
vanes
,
and
masts
of
ships
;
a
very
forest
.
 
<EOS>
Gables
,
housetops
,
garret
-
windows
,
wilderness
upon
wilderness
.
 
<EOS>
Smoke
and
noise
enough
for
all
the
world
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
After
the
first
glance
,
there
were
slight
features
in
the
midst
of
this
crowd
of
objects
,
which
sprung
out
from
the
mass
without
any
reason
,
as
it
were
,
and
took
hold
of
the
attention
whether
the
spectator
would
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
the
revolving
chimney
-
pots
on
one
great
stack
of
buildings
seemed
to
be
turning
gravely
to
each
other
every
now
and
then
,
and
whispering
the
result
of
their
separate
observation
of
what
was
going
on
below
.
 
<EOS>
Others
,
of
a
crook
-
backed
shape
,
appeared
to
be
maliciously
holding
themselves
askew
,
that
they
might
shut
the
prospect
out
and
baffle
Todgers
's
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
who
was
mending
a
pen
at
an
upper
window
over
the
way
,
became
of
paramount
importance
in
the
scene
,
and
made
a
blank
in
it
,
ridiculously
disproportionate
in
its
extent
,
when
he
retired
.
 
<EOS>
The
gambols
of
a
piece
of
cloth
upon
the
dyer
's
pole
had
far
more
interest
for
the
moment
than
all
the
changing
motion
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Yet
even
while
the
looker
-
on
felt
angry
with
himself
for
this
,
and
wondered
how
it
was
,
the
tumult
swelled
into
a
roar
;
the
hosts
of
objects
seemed
to
thicken
and
expand
a
hundredfold
,
and
after
gazing
round
him
,
quite
scared
,
he
turned
into
Todgers
's
again
,
much
more
rapidly
than
he
came
out
;
and
ten
to
one
he
told
M
Todgers
afterwards
that
if
he
had
n't
done
so
,
he
would
certainly
have
come
into
the
street
by
the
shortest
cut
;
that
is
to
say
,
head
-
foremost
.
   
<EOS>
So
said
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
when
they
retired
with
Mrs
Todgers
from
this
place
of
espial
,
leaving
the
youthful
porter
to
close
the
door
and
follow
them
downstairs
;
who
,
being
of
a
playful
temperament
,
and
contemplating
with
a
delight
peculiar
to
his
sex
and
time
of
life
,
any
chance
of
dashing
himself
into
small
fragments
,
lingered
behind
to
walk
upon
the
parapet
.
   
<EOS>
It
being
the
second
day
of
their
stay
in
London
,
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
and
Mrs
Todgers
were
by
this
time
highly
confidential
,
insomuch
that
the
last
-
named
lady
had
already
communicated
the
particulars
of
three
early
disappointments
of
a
tender
nature
;
and
had
furthermore
possessed
her
young
friends
with
a
general
summary
of
the
life
,
conduct
,
and
character
of
Mr
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
Who
,
it
seemed
,
had
cut
his
matrimonial
career
rather
short
,
by
unlawfully
running
away
from
his
happiness
,
and
establishing
himself
in
foreign
countries
as
a
bachelor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
pa
was
once
a
little
particular
in
his
attentions
,
my
dears
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
but
to
be
your
ma
was
too
much
happiness
denied
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
hardly
know
who
this
was
done
for
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
called
their
attention
to
an
oval
miniature
,
like
a
little
blister
,
which
was
tacked
up
over
the
kettle
-
holder
,
and
in
which
there
was
a
dreamy
shadowing
forth
of
her
own
visage
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
speaking
likeness
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
considered
so
once
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
warming
herself
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
at
the
fire
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
hardly
thought
you
would
have
known
it
,
my
loves
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
would
have
known
it
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
could
have
met
with
it
in
the
street
,
or
seen
it
in
a
shop
window
,
they
would
have
cried
"
Good
gracious
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Presiding
over
an
establishment
like
this
,
makes
sad
havoc
with
the
features
,
my
dear
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gravy
alone
,
is
enough
to
add
twenty
years
to
one
's
age
,
I
do
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
'
!
"
cried
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
anxiety
of
that
one
item
,
my
dears
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
keeps
the
mind
continually
upon
the
stretch
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
such
passion
in
human
nature
,
as
the
passion
for
gravy
among
commercial
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
It
's
nothing
to
say
a
joint
wo
n't
yield
---
a
whole
animal
would
n't
yield
---
<EOS>
the
amount
of
gravy
<EOS>
they
expect
each
day
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
I
have
undergone
in
consequence
,
"
cried
Mrs
Todgers
,
raising
her
eyes
and
shaking
her
head
,
"
no
one
would
believe
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
like
Mr
Pinch
,
Merry
!
"
said
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
always
noticed
it
in
him
,
you
remember
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
"
giggled
Merry
,
"
but
<EOS>
we
have
never
given
it
him
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
,
my
dears
,
having
to
deal
with
your
pa
's
pupils
who
ca
n't
help
themselves
,
are
able
to
take
your
own
way

"
said
Mrs
Todgers
;
"
but
in
a
commercial
establishment
,
where
any
gentleman
may
say
any
Saturday
evening
,
"
Mrs
Todgers
,
this
day
week
we
part
,
in
consequence
of
the
cheese
,
"
it
is
not
so
easy
to
preserve
a
pleasant
understanding
.
<EOS>
Your
pa
was
kind
enough
,
"
added
the
good
lady
,
"
to
invite
me
to
take
a
ride
with
you
to
-
day
;
and
I
think
he
mentioned
that
you
were
going
to
call
upon
Miss
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
Any
relation
to
the
gentleman
you
were
speaking
of
just
now

Miss
Pecksniff

<EOS>
"
   
"
For
goodness
sake
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
interposed
the
lively
Merry
,
"
do
n't
call
him
a
gentleman

<EOS>
My

Pinch
a

<EOS>
The

<EOS>
"
What

cried
Mrs
Todgers
,
embracing
her
with
great
affection

<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
a
quiz

I
do
declare

<EOS>
My

your

<EOS>
"
He
's
the
most
hideous
,
goggle
-
eyed
creature
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
in
existence
,
"
resumed
Merry
:
"
<EOS>
quite
an
ogre
.
 
<EOS>
The
ugliest
,
awkwardest
frightfullest
being
,
you
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
his
sister
,
so
I
leave
you
to
suppose
what
SHE
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
obliged
to
laugh
outright
<EOS>
,
I
know
I
shall
!
"
cried
the
charming
girl
,
"
I
never
shall
be
able
to
keep
my
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
The
notion
of
a
Miss
Pinch
presuming
to
exist
at
all
is
sufficient
to
kill
one
,
but
to
see
her
 
---
<EOS>
oh
my
stars
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
laughed
immensely
at
the
dear
love
's
humour
,
and
declared
she
was
quite
afraid
of
her
,
that
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
very
severe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
severe
?
"
cried
a
voice
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
such
thing
as
severity
in
our
family
,
I
hope
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
Mr
Pecksniff
peeped
smilingly
into
the
room
,
and
said
,
"
May
I
come
in
,
Mrs
Todgers
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
almost
screamed
,
for
the
little
door
of
communication
between
that
room
and
the
inner
one
being
wide
open
,
there
was
a
full
disclosure
of
the
sofa
bedstead
in
all
its
monstrous
impropriety
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
close
this
portal
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
;
and
having
done
so
,
said
,
though
not
without
confusion
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
you
can
come
in
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
we
to
-
day
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
jocosely
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
are
our
plans
?
 
<EOS>
Are
we
ready
to
go
and
see
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Poor
Thomas
Pinch
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
we
ready
,
"
returned
Mrs
Todgers
,
nodding
her
head
with
mysterious
intelligence
,
"
to
send
a
favourable
reply
to
Mr
Jinkins
's
round
-
robin
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
first
question
,
Mr
Pecksniff
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
Mr
Jinkins
's
robin
,
my
dear
madam
?
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
,
putting
one
arm
round
Mercy
,
and
the
other
round
Mrs
Todgers
,
whom
he
seemed
,
in
the
abstraction
of
the
moment
,
to
mistake
for
Charity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
Mr
Jinkins
's
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
he
began
to
get
it
up
,
and
indeed
always
takes
the
lead
in
the
house
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
playfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
why
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jinkins
is
a
man
of
superior
talents
,
"
observed
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
conceived
a
great
regard
for
Jinkins
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
Jinkins
's
desire
to
pay
polite
attention
to
my
daughters
,
as
an
additional
proof
of
the
friendly
feeling
of
Jinkins
,
Mrs
Todgers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
now
,
"
returned
that
lady
,
"
having
said
so
much
,
you
must
say
the
rest
,
Mr
Pecksniff
;
so
tell
the
dear
young
ladies
all
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
she
gently
eluded
Mr
Pecksniff
's
grasp
,
and
took
Miss
Charity
into
her
own
embrace
;
though
whether
she
was
impelled
to
this
proceeding
solely
by
the
irrepressible
affection
she
had
conceived
for
that
young
lady
,
or
whether
it
had
any
reference
to
a
lowering
,
not
to
say
distinctly
spiteful
expression
which
had
been
visible
in
her
face
for
some
moments
,
has
never
been
exactly
ascertained
.
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
Mr
Pecksniff
went
on
to
inform
his
daughters
of
the
purport
and
history
of
the
round
-
robin
aforesaid
,
which
was
in
brief
,
that
the
commercial
gentlemen
who
helped
to
make
up
the
sum
and
substance
of
that
noun
of
multitude
signifying
many
,
called
Todgers
's
,
desired
the
honour
of
their
presence
at
the
general
table
,
so
long
as
they
remained
in
the
house
,
and
besought
that
they
would
grace
the
board
at
dinner
-
time
next
day
,
the
same
being
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
He
further
said
,
that
Mrs
Todgers
being
a
consenting
party
to
this
invitation
,
he
was
willing
,
for
his
part
,
to
accept
it
;
and
so
left
them
that
he
might
write
his
gracious
answer
,
the
while
they
armed
themselves
with
their
best
bonnets
for
the
utter
defeat
and
overthrow
of
Miss
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
was
governess
in
a
family
,
a
lofty
family
;
perhaps
the
wealthiest
brass
and
copper
founders
'
family
known
to
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
They
lived
at
Camberwell
;
in
a
house
so
big
and
fierce
,
that
its
mere
outside
,
like
the
outside
of
a
giant
's
castle
,
struck
terror
into
vulgar
minds
and
made
bold
persons
quail
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
front
gate
;
with
a
great
bell
,
whose
handle
was
in
itself
a
note
of
admiration
;
and
a
great
lodge
;
which
being
close
to
the
house
,
rather
spoilt
the
look
-
out
certainly
but
made
the
look
-
in
tremendous
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
entry
,
a
great
porter
kept
constant
watch
and
ward
;
and
when
he
gave
the
visitor
high
leave
to
pass
,
he
rang
a
second
great
bell
,
responsive
to
whose
note
a
great
footman
appeared
in
due
time
at
the
great
halldoor
,
with
such
great
tags
upon
his
liveried
shoulder
that
he
was
perpetually
entangling
and
hooking
himself
among
the
chairs
and
tables
,
and
led
a
life
of
torment
which
could
scarcely
have
been
surpassed
,
if
he
had
been
a
blue
-
bottle
in
a
world
of
cobwebs
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
mansion
Mr
Pecksniff
,
accompanied
by
his
daughters
and
Mrs
Todgers
,
drove
gallantly
in
a
one
-
horse
fly
.
 
<EOS>
The
foregoing
ceremonies
having
been
all
performed
,
they
were
ushered
into
the
house
;
and
so
,
by
degrees
<EOS>
,
they
got
at
last
into
a
small
room
with
books
in
it
,
where
Mr
Pinch
's
sister
was
at
that
moment
instructing
her
eldest
pupil
;
to
wit
,
a
premature
little
woman
of
thirteen
years
old
,
who
had
already
arrived
at
such
a
pitch
of
whalebone
and
education
that
she
had
nothing
girlish
about
her
,
which
was
a
source
of
great
rejoicing
to
all
her
relations
and
friends
.
   
<EOS>
"
Visitors
for
Miss
Pinch
!
"
said
the
footman
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
an
ingenious
young
man
,
for
he
said
it
very
cleverly
;
with
a
nice
discrimination
between
the
cold
respect
with
which
he
would
have
announced
visitors
to
the
family
,
and
the
warm
personal
interest
with
which
he
would
have
announced
visitors
to
the
cook
.
   
<EOS>
"
Visitors
for
Miss
Pinch
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pinch
rose
hastily
;
with
such
tokens
of
agitation
as
plainly
declared
that
her
list
of
callers
was
not
numerous
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
the
little
pupil
became
alarmingly
upright
,
and
prepared
herself
to
take
mental
notes
of
all
that
might
be
said
and
done
.
<EOS>
For
the
lady
of
the
establishment
was
curious
in
the
natural
history
and
habits
of
the
animal
called
Governess
,
and
encouraged
her
daughters
to
report
thereon
whenever
occasion
served
;
which
was
,
in
reference
to
all
parties
concerned
,
very
laudable
,
improving
,
and
pleasant
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
melancholy
fact
;
but
it
must
be
related
,
that
Mr
Pinch
's
sister
was
not
at
all
ugly
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
she
had
a
good
face
;
a
very
mild
and
prepossessing
face
;
and
a
pretty
little
figure
---
slight
and
short
,
but
remarkable
for
its
neatness
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
of
her
brother
,
much
of
him
indeed
,
in
a
certain
gentleness
of
manner
,
and
in
her
look
of
timid
trustfulness
;
but
she
was
so
far
from
being
a
fright
,
or
a
dowdy
,
or
a
horror
,
or
anything
else
,
predicted
by
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
that
those
young
ladies
naturally
regarded
her
with
great
indignation
,
feeling
that
this
was
by
no
means
what
they
had
come
to
see
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mercy
,
as
having
the
larger
share
of
gaiety
,
bore
up
the
best
against
this
disappointment
,
and
carried
it
off
,
in
outward
show
at
least
,
with
a
titter
;
but
her
sister
,
not
caring
to
hide
her
disdain
,
expressed
it
pretty
openly
in
her
looks
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Mrs
Todgers
,
she
leaned
on
Mr
Pecksniff
's
arm
and
preserved
a
kind
of
genteel
grimness
,
suitable
to
any
state
of
mind
,
and
involving
any
shade
of
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
Miss
Pinch
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
taking
her
hand
condescendingly
in
one
of
his
,
and
patting
it
with
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
called
to
see
you
,
in
pursuance
of
a
promise
given
to
your
brother
,
Thomas
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
My
name
---
compose
yourself
,
Miss
Pinch
---
is
Pecksniff
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
good
man
emphasised
these
words
as
though
he
would
have
said
,
"
You
see
in
me
,
young
person
,
the
benefactor
of
your
race
;
the
patron
of
your
house
;
the
preserver
of
your
brother
,
who
is
fed
with
manna
daily
from
my
table
;
and
in
right
of
whom
there
is
a
considerable
balance
in
my
favour
at
present
standing
in
the
books
beyond
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
pride
,
for
I
can
afford
to
do
without
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
felt
it
all
as
if
it
had
been
Gospel
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Her
brother
writing
in
the
fullness
of
his
simple
heart
,
had
often
told
her
so
,
and
how
much
more
!
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pecksniff
ceased
to
speak
,
she
hung
her
head
,
and
dropped
a
tear
upon
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
<EOS>
very
well
,
Miss
Pinch
!
"
thought
the
sharp
pupil
,
"
crying
before
strangers
,
as
if
you
did
n't
like
the
situation
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thomas
is
well
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
;
"
and
sends
his
love
and
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
poor
fellow
,
that
he
will
ever
be
distinguished
in
our
profession
;
but
he
has
the
will
to
do
well
,
which
is
the
next
thing
to
having
the
power
;
and
,
therefore
,
we
must
bear
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
has
the
will
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
know
how
kindly
and
considerately
you
cherish
it
,
for
which
neither
he
nor
I
can
ever
be
grateful
enough
,
as
we
very
often
say
in
writing
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
too
,
"
she
added
,
glancing
gratefully
at
his
two
daughters
,
"
I
know
how
much
we
owe
to
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dears
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
turning
to
them
with
a
smile
:
"
Thomas
's
sister
is
saying
something
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
take
any
merit
to
ourselves
,
papa
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Cherry
,
as
they
both
apprised
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
,
with
a
curtsey
,
that
they
would
feel
obliged
if
she
would
keep
her
distance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pinch
's
being
so
well
provided
for
is
owing
to
you
alone
,
and
we
can
only
say
how
glad
we
are
to
hear
that
he
is
as
grateful
as
he
ought
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
<EOS>
very
well
,
Miss
Pinch
!
"
thought
the
pupil
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Got
a
grateful
brother
,
living
on
other
people
's
kindness
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
kind
of
you
,
"
said
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
,
with
Tom
's
own
simplicity
and
Tom
's
own
smile
,
"
to
come
here
;
very
kind
indeed
;
though
how
great
a
kindness
you
have
done
me
in
gratifying
my
wish
to
see
you
,
and
to
thank
you
with
my
own
lips
,
you
,
who
make
so
light
of
benefits
conferred
,
can
scarcely
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
grateful
;
very
pleasant
;
very
proper
,
"
murmured
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
makes
me
happy
too
,
"
said
Ruth
Pinch
,
who
now
that
her
first
surprise
was
over
,
had
a
chatty
,
cheerful
way
with
her
,
and
a
single
-
hearted
desire
to
look
upon
the
best
side
of
everything
,
which
was
the
very
moral
and
image
of
Tom
;
"
very
happy
to
think
that
you
will
be
able
to
tell
him
how
more
than
comfortably
I
am
situated
here
,
and
how
unnecessary
it
is
that
he
should
ever
waste
a
regret
on
my
being
cast
upon
my
own
resources
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
So
long
as
I
heard
that
he
was
happy
,
and
he
heard
that
I
was
,
"
said
Tom
's
sister
,
"
we
could
both
bear
,
without
one
impatient
or
complaining
thought
,
a
great
deal
more
than
ever
we
have
had
to
endure
<EOS>
,
I
am
very
certain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
ever
the
plain
truth
were
spoken
on
this
occasionally
false
earth
,
Tom
's
sister
spoke
it
when
she
said
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
whose
eyes
had
in
the
meantime
wandered
to
the
pupil
;
"
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
do
YOU
do
,
my
very
interesting
child
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
well
,
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
that
frosty
innocent
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
sweet
face
this
,
my
dears
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
turning
to
his
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
charming
manner
!
"
   
<EOS>
Both
young
ladies
had
been
in
ecstasies
with
the
scion
of
a
wealthy
house
(
through
whom
the
nearest
road
and
shortest
cut
to
her
parents
might
be
supposed
to
lie
)
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
vowed
that
anything
one
quarter
so
angelic
she
had
never
seen
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
wanted
but
a
pair
of
wings
,
a
dear
,
"
said
that
good
woman
,
"
to
be

"
If

Mr

added
Mr

;
"
that
I
,
and
my
daughters

and
Mrs
Todgers
,
of
London
,
did
not
intrude
upon

our
object
simply
was
to
take
some
notice
of
Miss
Pinch

whose
brother
is
a
young
man
in
my
employment

but
that
I
could
not
leave
this
very
chaste

adding
my
humble
tribute
,
as
an
Architect
,
to
the
correctness
and
elegance
of
the
owner
's
taste
,
and
to
his
just
appreciation
of
that
beautiful
art
to
the
cultivation
of
which
I
have
devoted
a
life

to
the
promotion

whose
glory

"
Missis
's
compliments
to
Miss
Pinch
,
"
said
the
footman
,
suddenly
appearing
,
and
speaking
in
exactly
the
same
key
as
before
,
"
and
begs
to
know
wot
<EOS>
my
young
lady
is
a
-
learning
of
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
Here
is
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
HE
will
take
the
card
.
 
<EOS>
With
my
compliments
,
if
you
please

young

<EOS>
My
dears
,
we
are
interrupting
the
studies

<EOS>
Let
us
go

"
   
<EOS>
Some
confusion
was
occasioned
for
an
instant
by
Mrs
Todgers
's
unstrapping
her
little
flat
hand
-
basket
,
and
hurriedly
entrusting
the
"
young
man
"
with
one
of
her
own
cards
,
which
,
in
addition
to
certain
detailed
information
relative
to
the
terms
of
the
commercial
establishment
,
bore
a
foot
-
note
to
the
effect
that
M
T
took
that
opportunity
of
thanking
those
gentlemen
who
had
honoured
her
with
their
favours
,
and
begged
they
would
have
the
goodness
,
if
satisfied
with
the
table
,
to
recommend
her
to
their
friends
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
,
recovered
this
document
,
and
buttoned
it
up
in
his
own
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
Then
he
said
to
Miss
Pinch
---
with
more
condescension
and
kindness
than
ever
,
for
it
was
desirable
<EOS>
the
footman
should
expressly
understand
that
they
were
not
friends
of
hers
,
but
patrons
:
   
"
<EOS>
Good
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
my
continued
protection
of
your
brother
Thomas
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
your
mind
quite
at
ease
,
Miss
Pinch
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Tom
's
sister
heartily
;
"
a
thousand
times
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
he
retorted
,
patting
her
gently
on
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
make
me
angry
if
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
My
sweet
child
"
---
to
the
pupil
---
"
farewell
!
 
<EOS>
That
fairy
creature
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
in
his
pensive
mood
hard
at
the
footman
,
as
if
he
meant
him
,
"
has
shed
a
vision
on
my
path
,
refulgent
in
its
nature
,
and
not
easily
to
be
obliterated
.
 
<EOS>
My
dears
,
are
you
ready
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
not
quite
ready
yet
,
for
they
were
still
caressing
the
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
tore
themselves
away
at
length
;
and
sweeping
past
Miss
Pinch
with
each
a
haughty
inclination
of
the
head
and
a
curtsey
strangled
in
its
birth
,
flounced
into
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
man
had
rather
a
long
job
in
showing
them
out
;
for
Mr
Pecksniff
's
delight
in
the
tastefulness
of
the
house
was
such
that
he
could
not
help
often
stopping
(
particularly
when
they
were
near
the
parlour
door
)
and
giving
it
expression
,
in
a
loud
voice
and
very
learned
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
delivered
,
between
the
study
and
the
hall
,
a
familiar
exposition
of
the
whole
science
of
architecture
as
applied
to
dwelling
-
houses
,
and
was
yet
in
the
freshness
of
his
eloquence
when
they
reached
the
garden
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
look
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
backing
from
the
steps
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
eyes
half
-
shut
that
he
might
the
better
take
in
the
proportions
of
the
exterior
:
"
If
you
look
,
my
dears
,
at
the
cornice
which
supports
the
roof
,
and
observe
the
airiness
of
its
construction
,
especially
where
it
sweeps
the
southern
angle
of
the
building
,
you
will
feel
with
me
---
How
do
you
do
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
're
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
Interrupting
himself
with
these
words
,
he
very
politely
bowed
to
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
at
an
upper
window
,
to
whom
he
spoke
---
not
because
the
gentleman
could
hear
him
(
for
he
certainly
could
not
)
,
but
as
an
appropriate
accompaniment
to
his
salutation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
,
my
dears
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
feigning
to
point
out
other
beauties
with
his
hand
,
"
that
this
is
the
proprietor
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
lead
to
something
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
looking
this
way
,
Charity
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
opening
the
window
pa
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
found
I
'm
professional
.
 
<EOS>
He
heard
me
inside
just
now
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
!
 
<EOS>
With
regard
to
the
fluted
pillars
in
the
portico
,
my
dears
---
"
   
"
Hallo
!
"
cried
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
your
servant
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
taking
off
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
proud
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
off
the
grass
,
will
you
!
"
<EOS>
roared
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
doubtful
of
his
having
heard
aright
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
---
?
"
   
"
Come
off
the
grass
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
gentleman
,
warmly
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
unwilling
to
intrude
,
sir
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
smilingly
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
ARE
intruding
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
unwarrantably
intruding
.
 
<EOS>
Trespassing
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
a
gravel
walk
,
do
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
it
's
meant
for
?
 
<EOS>
Open
the
gate
there
!
 
<EOS>
Show
that
party
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
clapped
down
the
window
again
,
and
disappeared
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
put
on
his
hat
,
and
walked
with
great
deliberation
and
in
profound
silence
to
the
fly
,
gazing
at
the
clouds
as
he
went
,
with
great
interest
.
 
<EOS>
After
helping
his
daughters
and
Mrs
Todgers
into
that
conveyance
,
he
stood
looking
at
it
for
some
moments
,
as
if
he
were
not
quite
certain
whether
it
was
a
carriage
or
a
temple
;
but
having
settled
this
point
in
his
mind
,
he
got
into
his
place
,
spread
his
hands
out
on
his
knees
,
and
smiled
upon
the
three
beholders
.
   
<EOS>
But
his
daughters
,
less
tranquil
-
minded
,
burst
into
a
torrent
of
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
This
came
,
they
said
,
of
cherishing
such
creatures
as
the
Pinches
.
 
<EOS>
This
came
of
lowering
themselves
to
their
level
.
 
<EOS>
This
came
of
putting
themselves
in
the
humiliating
position
of
seeming
to
know
such
bold
,
audacious
,
cunning
,
dreadful
girls
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
expected
this
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
predicted
it
to
Mrs
Todgers
,
as
she
(
Todgers
)
could
depone
,
that
very
morning
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
,
they
added
,
that
the
owner
of
the
house
,
supposing
them
to
be
Miss
Pinch
's
friends
,
had
acted
,
in
their
opinion
,
quite
correctly
,
and
had
done
no
more
than
,
under
such
circumstances
,
might
reasonably
have
been
expected
.
 
<EOS>
To
that
they
added
(
with
a
trifling
inconsistency
)
,
that
he
was
a
brute
and
a
bear
;
and
then
they
merged
into
a
flood
of
tears
,
which
swept
away
all
wandering
epithets
before
it
.
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
Miss
Pinch
was
scarcely
so
much
to
blame
in
the
matter
as
the
Seraph
,
who
,
immediately
on
the
withdrawal
of
the
visitors
,
had
hastened
to
report
them
at
head
-
quarters
,
with
a
full
account
of
their
having
presumptuously
charged
her
with
the
delivery
of
a
message
afterwards
consigned
to
the
footman
;
which
outrage
,
taken
in
conjunction
with
Mr
Pecksniff
's
unobtrusive
remarks
on
the
establishment
,
might
possibly
have
had
some
share
in
their
dismissal
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Pinch
,
however
,
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
with
both
parties
;
being
so
severely
taken
to
task
by
the
Seraph
's
mother
for
having
such
vulgar
acquaintances
,
that
she
was
fain
to
retire
to
her
own
room
in
tears
,
which
her
natural
cheerfulness
and
submission
,
and
the
delight
of
having
seen
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
having
received
a
letter
from
her
brother
,
were
at
first
insufficient
to
repress
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Pecksniff
,
he
told
them
in
the
fly
,
that
a
good
action
was
its
own
reward
;
and
rather
gave
them
to
understand
,
that
if
he
could
have
been
kicked
in
such
a
cause
,
he
would
have
liked
it
all
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
no
comfort
to
the
young
ladies
,
who
scolded
violently
the
whole
way
back
,
and
even
exhibited
,
more
than
once
,
a
keen
desire
to
attack
the
devoted
Mrs
Todgers
;
on
whose
personal
appearance
,
but
particularly
on
whose
offending
card
and
hand
-
basket
,
they
were
secretly
inclined
to
lay
the
blame
of
half
their
failure
.
   
<EOS>
Todgers
's
was
in
a
great
bustle
that
evening
,
partly
owing
to
some
additional
domestic
preparations
for
the
morrow
,
and
partly
to
the
excitement
always
inseparable
in
that
house
from
Saturday
night
,
when
every
gentleman
's
linen
arrived
at
a
different
hour
in
its
own
little
bundle
,
with
his
private
account
pinned
on
the
outside
.
<EOS>
There
was
always
a
great
clinking
of
pattens
downstairs
,
too
,
until
midnight
or
so
,
on
Saturdays
;
together
with
a
frequent
gleaming
of
mysterious
lights
in
the
area
;
much
working
at
the
pump
;
and
a
constant
jangling
of
the
iron
handle
of
the
pail
.
 
<EOS>
Shrill
altercations
from
time
to
time
arose
between
Mrs
Todgers
and
unknown
females
in
remote
back
kitchens
;
and
sounds
were
occasionally
heard
,
indicative
of
small
articles
of
iron
mongery
and
hardware
being
thrown
at
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
custom
of
that
youth
on
Saturdays
,
to
roll
up
his
shirt
sleeves
to
his
shoulders
,
and
pervade
all
parts
of
the
house
in
an
apron
of
coarse
green
baize
;
moreover
,
he
was
more
strongly
tempted
on
Saturdays
than
on
other
days
(
it
being
a
busy
time
)
,
to
make
excursive
bolts
into
the
neighbouring
alleys
when
he
answered
the
door
,
and
there
to
play
at
leap
-
frog
and
other
sports
with
vagrant
lads
,
until
pursued
and
brought
back
by
the
hair
of
his
head
or
the
lobe
of
his
ear
;
thus
he
was
quite
a
conspicuous
feature
among
the
peculiar
incidents
of
the
last
day
in
the
week
at
Todgers
's
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
especially
so
on
this
particular
Saturday
evening
,
and
honoured
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
with
a
deal
of
notice
;
seldom
passing
the
door
of
Mrs
Todgers
's
private
room
,
where
they
sat
alone
before
the
fire
,
working
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
,
without
putting
in
his
head
and
greeting
them
with
some
such
compliments
as
,
"
There
you
are
agin
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
An't
it
nice
?
"
<EOS>
---
and
similar
humorous
attentions
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
he
whispered
,
stopping
in
one
of
his
journeys
to
and
fro
,
"
young
ladies
,
there
's
soup
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
a
-
making
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
An't
<EOS>
she
a
-
putting
in
the
water
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
not
at
all
neither
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
answering
another
knock
,
he
thrust
in
his
head
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
fowls
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Not
skinny
ones
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
Presently
he
called
through
the
key
-
hole
:
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
fish
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Just
come
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
eat
none
of
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
with
this
special
warning
,
vanished
again
.
   
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
bye
,
he
returned
to
lay
the
cloth
for
supper
;
it
having
been
arranged
between
Mrs
Todgers
and
the
young
ladies
,
that
they
should
partake
of
an
exclusive
veal
-
cutlet
together
in
the
privacy
of
that
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
He
entertained
them
on
this
occasion
by
thrusting
the
lighted
candle
into
his
mouth
,
and
exhibiting
his
face
in
a
state
of
transparency
;
after
the
performance
of
which
feat
,
he
went
on
with
his
professional
duties
;
brightening
every
knife
as
he
laid
it
on
the
table
,
by
breathing
on
the
blade
and
afterwards
polishing
the
same
on
the
apron
already
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
completed
his
preparations
,
he
grinned
at
the
sisters
,
and
expressed
his
belief
that
the
approaching
collation
would
be
of
"
rather
a
spicy
sort
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
it
be
long
,
before
it
's
ready
,
Bailey
?
"
asked
Mercy
.
    
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Bailey
,
"
it
IS
cooked
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
come
up
,
she
was
dodging
among
the
tender
pieces
with
a
fork
,
and
eating
of
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
he
had
scarcely
achieved
the
utterance
of
these
words
,
when
he
received
a
manual
compliment
on
the
head
,
which
sent
him
staggering
against
the
wall
;
and
Mrs
Todgers
,
dish
in
hand
,
stood
indignantly
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
you
little
villain
!
"
said
that
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
you
bad
,
false
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
worse
than
yerself
,
"
retorted
Bailey
,
guarding
his
head
,
on
a
principle
invented
by
Mr
Thomas
Cribb
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Come
now
!
 
<EOS>
Do
that
again
,
will
yer
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
the
most
dreadful
child
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
setting
down
the
dish
,
"
I
ever
had
to
deal
with
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
spoil
him
to
that
extent
,
and
teach
him
such
things
,
that
I
'm
afraid
nothing
but
hanging
will
ever
do
him
any
good
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
Wot
do
you
go

and

"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
downstairs
,
you
vicious
boy
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
holding
the
door
open
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
me
?
 
<EOS>
Go
along
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
two
or
three
dexterous
feints
,
he
went
,
and
was
seen
no
more
that
night
,
save
once
,
when
he
brought
up
some
tumblers
and
hot
water
,
and
much
disturbed
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
by
squinting
hideously
behind
the
back
of
the
unconscious
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
Having
done
this
justice
to
his
wounded
feelings
,
he
retired
underground
;
where
,
in
company
with
a
swarm
of
black
beetles
and
a
kitchen
candle
,
he
employed
his
faculties
in
cleaning
boots
and
brushing
clothes
until
the
night
was
far
advanced
.
   
<EOS>
Benjamin
was
supposed
to
be
the
real
name
of
this
young
retainer
<EOS>
but
he
was
known
by
a
great
variety
of
names
.
 
<EOS>
Benjamin
,
for
instance
,
had
been
converted
into
Uncle
Ben
,
and
that
again
had
been
corrupted
into
Uncle
;
which
,
by
an
easy
transition
,
had
again
passed
into
Barnwell
,
in
memory
of
the
celebrated
relative
in
that
degree
who
was
shot
by
his
nephew
George
,
while
meditating
in
his
garden
at
Camberwell
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
at
Todgers
's
had
a
merry
habit
,
too
,
of
bestowing
upon
him
,
for
the
time
being
,
the
name
of
any
notorious
malefactor
or
minister
;
and
sometimes
when
current
events
were
flat
they
even
sought
the
pages
of
history
for
these
distinctions
;
as
Mr
Pitt
,
Young
Brownrigg
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
period
of
which
we
write
,
he
was
generally
known
among
the
gentlemen
as
Bailey
junior
;
a
name
bestowed
upon
him
in
contradistinction
,
perhaps
,
to
Old
Bailey
;
and
possibly
as
involving
the
recollection
of
an
unfortunate
lady
of
the
same
name
,
who
perished
by
her
own
hand
early
in
life
,
and
has
been
immortalised
in
a
ballad
.
   
<EOS>
The
usual
Sunday
dinner
-
hour
at
Todgers
's
was
two
o'clock
---
a
suitable
time
,
it
was
considered
for
all
parties
;
convenient
to
Mrs
Todgers
,
on
account
of
the
bakers
;
and
convenient
to
the
gentlemen
with
reference
to
their
afternoon
engagements
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
the
Sunday
which
was
to
introduce
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
to
a
full
knowledge
of
Todgers
's
and
its
society
,
the
dinner
was
postponed
until
five
,
in
order
that
everything
might
be
as
genteel
as
the
occasion
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
hour
drew
nigh
,
Bailey
junior
,
testifying
great
excitement
,
appeared
in
a
complete
suit
of
cast
-
off
clothes
several
sizes
too
large
for
him
,
and
in
particular
,
mounted
a
clean
shirt
of
such
extraordinary
magnitude
,
that
one
of
the
gentlemen
(
remarkable
for
his
ready
wit
)
called
him
"
collars
"
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
At
about
a
quarter
before
five
,
a
deputation
,
consisting
of
Mr
Jinkins
,
and
another
gentleman
,
whose
name
was
Gander
,
knocked
at
the
door
of
Mrs
Todgers
's
room
,
and
,
being
formally
introduced
to
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
by
their
parent
who
was
in
waiting
,
besought
the
honour
of
conducting
them
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
The
drawing
-
room
at
Todgers
's
was
out
of
the
common
style
;
so
much
<EOS>
so
indeed
,
that
you
would
hardly
have
taken
it
to
be
a
drawingroom
,
unless
you
were
told
so
by
somebody
who
was
in
the
secret
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
floor
-
clothed
all
over
;
and
the
ceiling
,
including
a
great
beam
in
the
middle
,
was
papered
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
the
three
little
windows
,
with
seats
in
them
,
commanding
the
opposite
archway
,
there
was
another
window
looking
point
blank
,
without
any
compromise
at
all
about
it
into
Jinkins
's
bedroom
;
and
high
up
,
all
along
one
side
of
the
wall
was
a
strip
of
panes
of
glass
,
two
-
deep
,
giving
light
to
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
oddest
closets
possible
,
with
little
casements
in
them
like
eight
-
day
clocks
,
lurking
in
the
wainscot
and
taking
the
shape
of
the
stairs
;
and
the
very
door
itself
(
which
was
painted
black
)
had
two
great
glass
eyes
in
its
forehead
,
with
an
inquisitive
green
pupil
in
the
middle
of
each
.
   
<EOS>
Here
the
gentlemen
were
all
assembled
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
general
cry
of
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
Bravo
Jink
!
<EOS>
"
when
Mr
Jinkins
appeared
with
Charity
on
his
arm
;
which
became
quite
rapturous
as
Mr
Gander
followed
,
escorting
Mercy
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
brought
up
the
rear
with
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
Then
the
presentations
took
place
.
 
<EOS>
They
included
a
gentleman
of
a
sporting
turn
,
who
propounded
questions
on
jockey
subjects
to
the
editors
of
Sunday
papers
,
which
were
regarded
by
his
friends
as
rather
stiff
things
to
answer
;
and
they
included
a
gentleman
of
a
theatrical
turn
,
who
had
once
entertained
serious
thoughts
of
"
coming
out
,
"
but
had
been
kept
in
by
the
wickedness
of
human
nature
;
and
they
included
a
gentleman
of
a
debating
turn
,
who
was
strong
at
speech
-
making
;
and
a
gentleman
of
a
literary
turn
,
who
wrote
squibs
upon
the
rest
,
and
knew
the
weak
side
of
everybody
's
character
but
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
gentleman
of
a
vocal
turn
,
and
a
gentleman
of
a
smoking
turn
,
and
a
gentleman
of
a
convivial
turn
;
some
of
the
gentlemen
had
a
turn
for
whist
,
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
gentlemen
had
a
strong
turn
for
billiards
and
betting
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
all
,
it
may
be
presumed
,
a
turn
for
business
;
being
all
commercially
employed
in
one
way
or
other
;
and
had
,
every
one
in
his
own
way
,
a
decided
turn
for
pleasure
to
boot
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jinkins
was
of
a
fashionable
turn
;
being
a
regular
frequenter
of
the
Parks
on
Sundays
,
and
knowing
a
great
many
carriages
by
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
mysteriously
,
too
,
of
splendid
women
,
and
was
suspected
of
having
once
committed
himself
with
a
Countess
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gander
was
of
a
witty
turn
being
indeed
the
gentleman
who
had
originated
the
sally
about
"
collars
;
"
which
sparkling
pleasantry
was
now
retailed
from
mouth
to
mouth
,
under
the
title
of
Gander
's
Last
,
and
was
received
in
all
parts
of
the
room
with
great
applause
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jinkins
<EOS>
it
may
be
added
,
was
much
the
oldest
of
the
party
;
being
a
fish
-
salesman
's
book
-
keeper
,
<EOS>
aged
forty
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
oldest
boarder
also
;
and
in
right
of
his
double
seniority
,
took
the
lead
in
the
house
,
as
Mrs
Todgers
had
already
said
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
considerable
delay
in
the
production
of
dinner
,
and
<EOS>
poor
Mrs
Todgers
,
being
reproached
in
confidence
by
Jinkins
,
slipped
in
and
out
,
at
least
twenty
times
to
see
about
it
;
always
coming
back
as
though
she
had
no
such
thing
upon
her
mind
,
and
had
n't
been
out
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
hitch
in
the
conversation
nevertheless
;
for
one
gentleman
,
who
travelled
in
the
perfumery
line
,
exhibited
an
interesting
nick
-
nack
,
in
the
way
of
a
remarkable
cake
of
shaving
soap
which
he
had
lately
met
with
in
Germany
;
and
the
gentleman
of
a
literary
turn
repeated
(
by
desire
)
<EOS>
some
sarcastic
stanzas
he
had
recently
produced
on
the
freezing
of
the
tank
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
These
amusements
,
with
the
miscellaneous
conversation
arising
out
of
them
,
passed
the
time
splendidly
,
until
dinner
was
announced
by
Bailey
junior
in
these
terms
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
wittles
is
up
!
"
   
<EOS>
On
which
notice
they
immediately
descended
to
the
banquet
-
hall
;
some
of
the
more
facetious
spirits
in
the
rear
taking
down
gentlemen
as
if
they
were
ladies
,
in
imitation
of
the
fortunate
possessors
of
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
said
grace
---
a
short
and
pious
grace
,
involving
a
blessing
on
the
appetites
of
those
present
,
and
committing
all
persons
who
had
nothing
to
eat
,
to
the
care
of
Providence
;
whose
business
(
so
said
the
grace
,
in
effect
)
<EOS>
it
clearly
was
,
to
look
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
fell
to
with
less
ceremony
than
appetite
;
the
table
groaning
beneath
the
weight
,
not
only
of
the
delicacies
whereof
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
had
been
previously
forewarned
,
but
of
boiled
beef
,
roast
veal
,
bacon
,
pies
and
abundance
of
such
heavy
vegetables
as
are
favourably
known
to
housekeepers
for
their
satisfying
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
which
,
there
were
bottles
of
stout
,
bottles
of
wine
,
bottles
of
ale
,
and
divers
other
strong
drinks
,
native
and
foreign
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
was
highly
agreeable
to
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
who
were
in
immense
request
;
sitting
one
on
either
hand
of
Mr
Jinkins
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
;
and
who
were
called
upon
to
take
wine
with
some
new
admirer
every
minute
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
hardly
ever
felt
so
pleasant
,
and
so
full
of
conversation
,
in
their
lives
;
Mercy
,
in
particular
,
was
uncommonly
brilliant
,
and
said
so
many
good
things
in
the
way
of
lively
repartee
that
she
was
looked
upon
as
a
prodigy
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
"
as
that
young
lady
observed
,
"
they
felt
now
,
indeed
,
that
they
were
in
London
,
and
for
the
first
time
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
Their
young
friend
Bailey
sympathized
in
these
feelings
to
the
fullest
extent
,
and
,
abating
nothing
of
his
patronage
,
gave
them
every
encouragement
in
his
power
;
favouring
them
,
when
the
general
attention
was
diverted
from
his
proceedings
,
with
many
nods
and
winks
and
other
tokens
of
recognition
,
and
occasionally
touching
his
nose
with
a
corkscrew
,
as
if
to
express
the
Bacchanalian
character
of
the
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
In
truth
,
perhaps
even
the
spirits
of
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
and
the
hungry
watchfulness
of
Mrs
Todgers
,
were
less
worthy
of
note
than
the
proceedings
of
this
remarkable
boy
,
whom
nothing
disconcerted
or
put
out
of
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
piece
of
crockery
,
a
dish
or
otherwise
,
chanced
to
slip
through
his
hands
(
which
happened
once
or
twice
)
,
he
let
it
go
with
perfect
good
breeding
,
and
never
added
to
the
painful
emotions
of
the
company
by
exhibiting
the
least
regret
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
,
by
hurrying
to
and
fro
,
disturb
the
repose
of
the
assembly
,
as
many
well
-
trained
servants
do
;
on
the
contrary
,
feeling
the
hopelessness
of
waiting
upon
so
large
a
party
,
he
left
the
gentlemen
to
help
themselves
to
what
they
wanted
,
and
seldom
stirred
from
behind
Mr
Jinkins
's
chair
,
where
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
his
legs
planted
pretty
wide
apart
,
he
led
the
laughter
,
and
enjoyed
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
The
dessert
was
splendid
.
 
<EOS>
No
waiting
either
.
 
<EOS>
The
pudding
-
plates
had
been
washed
in
a
little
tub
outside
the
door
while
cheese
was
on
,
and
though
they
were
moist
and
warm
with
friction
,
still
there
they
were
again
,
up
to
the
mark
,
and
true
to
time
.
 
<EOS>
Quarts
of
almonds
;
dozens
of
oranges
;
pounds
of
raisins
;
stacks
of
biffins
;
soup
-
plates
full
of
nuts
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Oh
,
Todgers
's
could
do
it
when
it
chose
!
<EOS>
mind
that
.
   
<EOS>
Then
more
wine
came
on
;
red
wines
and
white
wines
;
and
a
large
china
bowl
of
punch
,
brewed
by
the
gentleman
of
a
convivial
turn
,
who
adjured
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
not
to
be
despondent
on
account
of
its
dimensions
,
as
there
were
materials
in
the
house
for
the
decoction
of
half
a
dozen
more
of
the
same
size
.
 
<EOS>
Good
gracious
,
how
they
laughed
!
 
<EOS>
How
they
coughed
when
they
sipped
it
,
because
it
was
so
strong
;
and
how
they
laughed
again
when
somebody
vowed
that
but
for
its
colour
it
might
have
been
mistaken
,
in
regard
of
its
innocuous
qualities
,
for
new
milk
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
shout
of
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
burst
from
the
gentlemen
when
they
pathetically
implored
Mr
Jinkins
to
suffer
them
to
qualify
it
with
hot
water
;
and
how
blushingly
,
by
little
and
little
,
did
each
of
them
drink
her
whole
glassful
,
down
to
its
very
dregs
!
   
<EOS>
Now
comes
the
trying
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
,
as
Mr
Jinkins
says
(
gentlemanly
creature
,
Jinkins
---
never
at
a
loss
!
)
,
is
about
to
leave
the
firmament
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Pecksniff
!
"
says
Mrs
Todgers
,
softly
,
"
will
you
---
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
more
,
Mrs
Todgers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
rises
;
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
rise
;
all
rise
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mercy
Pecksniff
looks
downward
for
her
scarf
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
where
CAN
it
be
?
<EOS>
Sweet
girl
,
she
has
it
on
;
not
on
her
fair
neck
,
but
loose
upon
her
flowing
figure
.
 
<EOS>
A
dozen
hands
assist
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
all
confusion
.
<EOS>
The
youngest
gentleman
in
company
thirsts
to
murder
Jinkins
.
 
<EOS>
She
skips
and
joins
her
sister
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
has
her
arm
about
the
waist
of
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
She
winds
her
arm
around
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Diana
,
what
a
picture
!
 
<EOS>
The
last
things
visible
are
a
shape
and
a
skip
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
let
us
drink
the
ladies
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
enthusiasm
is
tremendous
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
of
a
debating
turn
rises
in
the
midst
,
and
suddenly
lets
loose
a
tide
of
eloquence
which
bears
down
everything
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
reminded
of
a
toast
---
a
toast
to
which
they
will
respond
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
individual
present
;
he
has
him
in
his
eye
;
to
whom
they
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
repeats
it
---
a
debt
of
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
Their
rugged
natures
have
been
softened
and
ameliorated
that
day
,
by
the
society
of
lovely
woman
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
gentleman
in
company
whom
two
accomplished
and
delightful
<EOS>
females
regard
with
veneration
,
as
the
fountain
of
their
existence
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
when
yet
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
lisped
in
language
scarce
intelligible
,
they
called
that
individual
"
Father
!
"
 
<EOS>
There
is
great
applause
.
 
<EOS>
He
gives
them
"
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
God
bless
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
all
shake
hands
with
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
they
drink
the
toast
.
 
<EOS>
The
youngest
gentleman
in
company
does
so
with
a
thrill
;
for
he
feels
that
a
mysterious
influence
pervades
the
man
who
claims
that
being
in
the
pink
scarf
for
his
daughter
.
   
<EOS>
What
saith
Mr
Pecksniff
in
reply
?
 
<EOS>
Or
rather
let
the
question
be
,
What
leaves
he
unsaid
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
.
 
<EOS>
More
punch
is
called
for
,
and
produced
,
and
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
Enthusiasm
mounts
still
higher
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
comes
out
freely
in
his
own
character
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
of
a
theatrical
turn
recites
.
 
<EOS>
The
vocal
gentleman
regales
them
with
a
song
.
 
<EOS>
Gander
leaves
the
Gander
of
all
former
feasts
whole
leagues
behind
.
 
<EOS>
HE
rises
to
propose
a
toast
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
The
Father
of
Todgers
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
their
common
friend
Jink
<EOS>
---
it
is
old
Jink
,
if
he
may
call
him
by
that
familiar
and
endearing
appellation
.
 
<EOS>
The
youngest
gentleman
in
company
utters
a
frantic
negative
.
 
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
have
it
<EOS>
---
he
ca
n't
bear
it
---
it
must
n't
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
depth
of
feeling
is
misunderstood
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
supposed
to
be
a
little
elevated
;
and
nobody
heeds
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jinkins
thanks
them
from
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
by
many
degrees
,
the
proudest
day
in
his
humble
career
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
looks
around
him
on
the
present
occasion
,
he
feels
that
he
wants
words
in
which
to
express
his
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
One
thing
he
will
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
hopes
it
has
been
shown
that
Todgers
's
can
be
true
to
itself
;
and
that
,
an
opportunity
arising
,
it
can
come
out
quite
as
strong
as
its
neighbours
---
perhaps
stronger
.
 
<EOS>
He
reminds
them
,
amidst
thunders
of
encouragement
,
that
they
have
heard
of
a
somewhat
similar
establishment
in
Cannon
Street
;
and
that
they
have
heard
it
praised
.
 
<EOS>
He
wishes
to
draw
no
invidious
comparisons
;
he
would
be
the
last
man
to
do
it
;
but
when
that
Cannon
Street
establishment
shall
be
able
to
produce
such
a
combination
of
wit
and
beauty
as
has
graced
that
board
that
day
,
and
shall
be
able
to
serve
up
(
<EOS>
all
things
considered
)
such
a
dinner
as
that
of
which
they
have
just
partaken
,
he
will
be
happy
to
talk
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Until
then
,
gentlemen
,
he
will
stick
to
Todgers
's
.
   
<EOS>
More
punch
,
more
enthusiasm
,
more
speeches
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
's
health
is
drunk
,
saving
the
youngest
gentleman
's
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
sits
apart
,
with
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
a
vacant
chair
,
and
glares
disdainfully
at
Jinkins
.
 
<EOS>
Gander
,
in
a
convulsing
speech
,
gives
them
the
health
of
Bailey
junior
;
hiccups
are
heard
;
and
a
glass
is
broken
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jinkins
feels
that
it
is
time
to
join
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
He
proposes
,
as
a
final
sentiment
,
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
worthy
to
be
remembered
separately
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
,
hear
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
is
;
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
all
find
fault
with
her
at
other
times
;
but
every
man
feels
now
,
that
he
could
die
in
her
defence
.
   
<EOS>
They
go
upstairs
,
where
they
are
not
expected
so
soon
;
for
Mrs
Todgers
is
asleep
,
Miss
Charity
is
adjusting
her
hair
,
and
Mercy
,
who
has
made
a
sofa
of
one
of
the
window
-
seats
is
in
a
gracefully
recumbent
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
rising
hastily
,
when
Mr
Jinkins
implores
her
,
for
all
their
sakes
,
not
to
stir
;
she
looks
too
graceful
and
too
lovely
,
he
remarks
,
to
be
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
She
laughs
,
and
yields
,
and
fans
herself
,
and
drops
her
fan
,
and
<EOS>
there
is
a
rush
to
pick
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
Being
now
installed
,
by
one
consent
,
as
the
beauty
of
the
party
,
she
is
cruel
and
capricious
,
and
sends
gentlemen
on
messages
to
other
gentlemen
,
and
forgets
all
about
them
before
they
can
return
with
the
answer
,
and
invents
a
thousand
tortures
,
rending
their
hearts
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
Bailey
brings
up
the
tea
and
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
small
cluster
of
admirers
round
Charity
;
but
they
are
only
those
who
can
not
get
near
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
The
youngest
gentleman
in
company
is
pale
,
but
collected
,
and
still
sits
apart
;
for
his
spirit
loves
to
hold
communion
with
itself
,
and
his
soul
recoils
from
noisy
revellers
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
a
consciousness
of
his
presence
and
adoration
.
 
<EOS>
He
sees
it
flashing
sometimes
in
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Have
a
care
<EOS>
,
Jinkins
,
ere
you
provoke
a
desperate
man
to
frenzy
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
followed
his
younger
friends
upstairs
,
and
taken
a
chair
at
the
side
of
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
also
spilt
a
cup
of
coffee
over
his
legs
without
appearing
to
be
aware
of
the
circumstance
;
nor
did
he
seem
to
know
that
there
was
muffin
on
his
knee
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
have
they
used
you
downstairs
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
hostess
.
   
<EOS>
"
Their
conduct
has
been
such
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
as
I
can
never
think
of
without
emotion
,
or
remember
without
a
tear
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
goodness
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
that
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
low
you
are
in
your
spirits
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
man
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shedding
tears
and
speaking
with
an
imperfect
articulation
,
"
but
I
am
also
a
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
also
a
widower
.
 
<EOS>
My
feelings
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
will
not
consent
to
be
entirely
smothered
,
like
the
young
children
in
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
grown
up
,
and
the
more
I
press
the
bolster
on
them
,
the
more
they
look
round
the
corner
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
suddenly
became
conscious
of
the
bit
of
muffin
,
and
stared
at
it
intently
;
shaking
his
head
the
while
,
in
a
forlorn
and
imbecile
manner
,
as
if
he
regarded
it
as
his
evil
genius
,
and
mildly
reproached
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
beautiful
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
he
said
,
turning
his
glazed
eye
again
upon
her
,
without
the
least
preliminary
notice
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
had
a
small
property
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
heard
,
"
cried
Mrs
Todgers
with
great
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Those
are
her
daughters
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
pointing
out
the
young
ladies
,
with
increased
emotion
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
had
no
doubt
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mercy
and
Charity
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
Charity
and
Mercy
.
 
<EOS>
Not
unholy
names
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pecksniff
!
"
cried
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
ghastly
smile
!
 
<EOS>
Are
you
ill
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
pressed
his
hand
upon
her
arm
,
and
answered
in
a
solemn
manner
,
and
a
faint
voice
,
"
Chronic
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cholic
?
"
cried
the
frightened
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Chron
-
ic
,
"
he
repeated
with
some
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Chron
-
ic
.
 
<EOS>
A
chronic
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
its
victim
from
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
carrying
me
to
my
grave
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
reckless
with
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
rather
glad
of
it
,
upon
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
like
her
,
Mrs
Todgers
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
squeeze
me
so
tight
,
pray
,
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
of
the
gentlemen
should
notice
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
her
sake
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
---
in
honour
of
her
memory
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
sake
of
a
voice
from
the
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
VERY
like
her
Mrs
Todgers
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
world
this
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
you
may
say
that
!
"
cried
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
it
is
a
vain
and
thoughtless
world
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
overflowing
with
despondency
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
young
people
about
us
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
sense
<EOS>
have
they
of
their
responsibilities
?
 
<EOS>
None
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
your
other
hand
,
Mrs
Todgers
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
hesitated
,
and
said
"
she
did
n't
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
a
voice
from
the
grave
no
influence
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
,
dismal
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
irreligious
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
creature
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Hush
!
"
urged
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Really
you
must
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
me
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
suppose
it
's
me
;
it
's
the
voice
;
it
's
her
voice
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Pecksniff
deceased
,
must
have
had
an
unusually
thick
and
husky
voice
for
a
lady
,
and
rather
a
stuttering
voice
,
and
to
say
the
truth
somewhat
of
a
drunken
voice
,
if
it
had
ever
borne
much
resemblance
to
that
in
which
Mr
Pecksniff
spoke
just
then
.
 
<EOS>
But
perhaps
this
was
delusion
on
his
part
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
a
day
of
enjoyment
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
but
still
it
has
been
a
day
of
torture
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
reminded
me
of
my
loneliness
.
 
<EOS>
What
am
I
in
the
world
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
An
excellent
gentleman
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
consolation
in
that
too
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
better
man
living
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
I
am
sure
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
smiled
through
his
tears
,
and
slightly
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
"
he
said
,
"
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
happiness
to
me
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
to
make
young
people
happy
.
 
<EOS>
The
happiness
of
my
pupils
is
my
chief
object

<EOS>
I
dote
upon
'em

<EOS>
They
dote
upon
me
too

sometimes

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Always
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
they
say
they
have
n't
improved
,
ma'am

"
whispered
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
at
her
with
profound
mystery
,
and
motioning
to
her
to
advance
her
ear
a
little
closer
to
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
they
say
they
have
n't
improved
,
ma'am
,
and
the
premium
was
too
high
,
they
lie
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wish
it
to
be
mentioned
;
you
will
understand
me
;
but
I
say
to
you
as
to
an
old
friend
,
they
lie
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Base
wretches
they
must
be
!
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
you
are
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
respect
you
for
that
observation

<EOS>
A
word
in
your
ear

<EOS>
To
Parents

Guardians

<EOS>
This
is
in
confidence

Mrs
Todgers

"
   
<EOS>
"
The
strictest

of
course

cried
that
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
Parents
and
Guardians
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
eligible
opportunity
now
offers
,
which
unites
the
advantages
of
the
best
practical
architectural
education
with
the
comforts
of
a
home
,
and
the
constant
association
with
some
,
who
,
however
humble
their
sphere
and
limited
their
capacity
---
observe
!
<EOS>
---
are
not
unmindful
of
their
moral
responsibilities
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
looked
a
little
puzzled
to
know
what
this
might
mean
,
as
well
she
might
;
for
it
was
,
as
the
reader
may
perchance
remember
,
Mr
Pecksniff
's
usual
form
of
advertisement
when
he
wanted
a
pupil
;
and
seemed
to
have
no
particular
reference
,
at
present
,
to
anything
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pecksniff
held
up
his
finger
as
a
caution
to
her
not
to
interrupt
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
any
parent
or
guardian
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
who
desires
to
avail
himself
of
such
an
opportunity
for
a
young
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
An
orphan
would
be
preferred
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
of
any
orphan
with
three
or
four
hundred
pound
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
reflected
,
and
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
hear
of
an
orphan
with
three
or
four
hundred
pound
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
let
that
dear
orphan
's
friends
apply
,
by
letter
post
-
paid
,
to
S*P
,
Post
Office
,
Salisbury
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
who
he
is
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
falling
heavily
against
her
;
"
Chronic
---
chronic
!
 
<EOS>
Let
's
have
a
little
drop
of
something
to
drink
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
life
,
Miss
Pecksniffs
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Todgers
,
aloud
,
"
your
dear
pa
's
took
very
poorly
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
straightened
himself
by
a
surprising
effort
,
as
every
one
turned
hastily
towards
him
;
and
standing
on
his
feet
,
regarded
the
assembly
with
a
look
of
ineffable
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
it
gave
place
to
a
smile
;
a
feeble
,
helpless
,
melancholy
smile
;
bland
,
almost
to
sickliness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
repine
,
my
friends
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
weep
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
chronic
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
these
words
,
after
making
a
futile
attempt
to
pull
off
his
shoes
,
he
fell
into
the
fireplace
.
   
<EOS>
The
youngest
gentleman
in
company
had
him
out
in
a
second
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
before
a
hair
upon
his
head
was
singed
,
he
had
him
on
the
hearth
-
rug
---
her
father
!
   
<EOS>
She
was
almost
beside
herself
.
 
<EOS>
So
was
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Jinkins
consoled
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
consoled
them
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
had
something
to
say
,
except
the
youngest
gentleman
in
company
,
who
with
a
noble
self
-
devotion
did
the
heavy
work
,
and
held
up
Mr
Pecksniff
's
head
without
being
taken
notice
of
by
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
they
gathered
round
,
and
agreed
to
carry
him
upstairs
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
youngest
gentleman
in
company
was
rebuked
by
Jinkins
for
tearing
Mr
Pecksniff
's
coat
!
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
But
no
matter
.
   
<EOS>
They
carried
him
upstairs
,
and
crushed
the
youngest
gentleman
at
every
step
.
 
<EOS>
His
bedroom
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
and
it
was
a
long
way
;
but
they
got
him
there
in
course
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
them
frequently
on
the
road
for
a
little
drop
of
something
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
an
idiosyncrasy
.
 
<EOS>
The
youngest
gentleman
in
company
proposed
a
draught
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
called
him
opprobious
names
for
the
suggestion
.
   
<EOS>
Jinkins
and
Gander
took
the
rest
upon
themselves
,
and
made
him
as
comfortable
as
they
could
,
on
the
outside
of
his
bed
;
and
when
he
seemed
disposed
to
sleep
,
they
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
they
had
all
gained
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
a
vision
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
strangely
attired
,
was
seen
to
flutter
on
the
top
landing
.
 
<EOS>
He
desired
to
collect
their
sentiments
,
it
seemed
,
upon
the
nature
of
human
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friends
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
over
the
banisters
,
"
let
us
improve
our
minds
by
mutual
inquiry
and
discussion
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
be
moral
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
contemplate
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
Jinkins
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
cried
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
to
bed
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
bed
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bed
!
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
the
voice
of
the
sluggard
,
I
hear
him
complain
<EOS>
,
you
have
woke
me
too
soon
,
I
must
slumber
again
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
young
orphan
will
repeat
the
remainder
of
that
simple
piece
from
Doctor
Watts
's
collection
,
an
eligible
opportunity
now
offers
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
volunteered
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
soothing
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Extremely
so
.
 
<EOS>
Cool
and
refreshing
;
particularly
to
the
legs
!
 
<EOS>
The
legs
of
the
human
subject
,
my
friends
,
are
a
beautiful
production
.
<EOS>
Compare
them
with
wooden
legs
,
and
observe
the
difference
between
the
anatomy
of
nature
and
the
anatomy
of
art
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
leaning
over
the
banisters
,
with
an
odd
recollection
of
his
familiar
manner
among
new
pupils
at
home
,
"
that
I
should
very
much
like
to
see
Mrs
Todgers
's
notion
of
a
wooden
leg
,
if
perfectly
agreeable
to
herself
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
it
appeared
impossible
to
entertain
any
reasonable
hopes
of
him
after
this
speech
,
Mr
Jinkins
and
Mr
Gander
went
upstairs
again
,
and
once
more
got
him
into
bed
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
had
not
descended
to
the
second
floor
before
he
was
out
again
;
nor
,
when
they
had
repeated
the
process
,
had
they
descended
the
first
flight
,
before
he
was
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
as
often
as
he
was
shut
up
in
his
own
room
,
he
darted
out
afresh
,
charged
with
some
new
moral
sentiment
,
which
he
continually
repeated
over
the
banisters
,
with
extraordinary
relish
,
and
an
irrepressible
desire
for
the
improvement
of
his
fellow
creatures
that
nothing
could
subdue
.
   
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
when
they
had
got
him
into
bed
for
the
thirtieth
time
or
so
,
Mr
Jinkins
held
him
,
while
his
companion
went
downstairs
in
search
of
Bailey
junior
,
with
whom
he
presently
returned
.
 
<EOS>
That
youth
having
been
apprised
of
the
service
required
of
him
,
was
in
great
spirits
,
and
brought
up
a
stool
,
a
candle
,
and
his
supper
;
to
the
end
that
he
might
keep
watch
outside
the
bedroom
door
with
tolerable
comfort
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
completed
his
arrangements
,
they
locked
Mr
Pecksniff
in
,
and
left
the
key
on
the
outside
;
charging
the
young
page
to
listen
attentively
for
symptoms
of
an
apoplectic
nature
,
with
which
the
patient
might
be
troubled
,
and
,
in
case
of
any
such
presenting
themselves
,
to
summon
them
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
Mr
Bailey
modestly
replied
that
"
he
hoped
he
knowed
wot
o'clock
it
wos
in
gineral
,
and
did
n't
date
his
letters
to
his
friends
from
Todgers
's
for
nothing
.
"
    
<EOS>
Chapter
10
.
<EOS>
Containing
strange
matter
,
on
which
many
events
in
this
history
may
,
for
their
good
or
evil
influence
,
chiefly
depend
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pecksniff
came
to
town
on
business
.
 
<EOS>
Had
he
forgotten
that
?
<EOS>
Was
he
always
taking
his
pleasure
with
Todgers
's
jovial
brood
,
unmindful
of
the
serious
demands
,
whatever
they
might
be
,
upon
his
calm
consideration
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
   
<EOS>
Time
and
tide
will
wait
for
no
man
,
saith
the
adage
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
men
have
to
wait
for
time
and
tide
.
 
<EOS>
That
tide
which
,
taken
at
the
flood
,
would
lead
Seth
Pecksniff
on
to
fortune
,
was
marked
down
in
the
table
,
and
about
to
flow
.
 
<EOS>
No
idle
Pecksniff
lingered
far
inland
,
unmindful
of
the
changes
of
the
stream
;
but
there
,
upon
the
water
's
edge
,
over
his
shoes
already
,
stood
the
worthy
creature
,
prepared
to
wallow
in
the
very
mud
,
so
that
it
slid
towards
the
quarter
of
his
hope
.
   
<EOS>
The
trustfulness
of
his
two
fair
daughters
was
beautiful
indeed
.
<EOS>
They
had
that
firm
reliance
on
their
parent
's
nature
,
which
taught
them
to
feel
certain
that
in
all
he
did
he
had
his
purpose
straight
and
full
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
its
noble
end
and
object
was
himself
,
which
almost
of
necessity
included
them
,
they
knew
.
 
<EOS>
The
devotion
of
these
maids
was
perfect
.
   
<EOS>
Their
filial
confidence
was
rendered
the
more
touching
,
by
their
having
no
knowledge
of
their
parent
's
real
designs
,
in
the
present
instance
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
they
knew
of
his
proceedings
was
,
that
every
morning
,
after
the
early
breakfast
,
he
repaired
to
the
post
office
and
inquired
for
letters
.
 
<EOS>
That
task
performed
,
his
business
for
the
day
was
over
;
and
he
again
relaxed
,
until
the
rising
of
another
sun
proclaimed
the
advent
of
another
post
.
   
<EOS>
This
went
on
for
four
or
five
days
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
one
morning
,
Mr
Pecksniff
returned
with
a
breathless
rapidity
,
strange
to
observe
in
him
,
at
other
times
so
calm
;
and
,
seeking
immediate
speech
with
his
daughters
,
shut
himself
up
with
them
in
private
conference
for
two
whole
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
that
passed
in
this
period
,
only
the
following
words
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
utterance
are
known
:
   
<EOS>
"
How
he
has
come
to
change
so
very
much
(
if
it
should
turn
out
as
I
expect
,
that
he
has
)
,
we
need
n't
stop
to
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
My
dears
,
I
have
my
thoughts
upon
the
subject
,
but
I
will
not
impart
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
that
we
will
not
be
proud
,
resentful
,
or
unforgiving
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
wants
our
friendship
he
shall
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
our
duty
,
I
hope
!
"
   
<EOS>
That
same
day
at
noon
,
an
old
gentleman
alighted
from
a
hackney
-
coach
at
the
post
-
office
,
and
,
giving
his
name
,
inquired
for
a
letter
addressed
to
himself
,
and
directed
to
be
left
till
called
for
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
lying
there
some
days
.
 
<EOS>
The
superscription
was
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
hand
,
and
it
was
sealed
with
Mr
Pecksniff
's
seal
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
very
short
,
containing
indeed
nothing
more
than
an
address
"
with
Mr
Pecksniff
's
respectful
,
and
(
not
withstanding
what
has
passed
)
sincerely
affectionate
regards
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
tore
off
the
direction
---
scattering
the
rest
in
fragments
to
the
winds
---
and
giving
it
to
the
coachman
,
bade
him
drive
as
near
that
place
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
these
instructions
he
was
driven
to
the
Monument
;
where
he
again
alighted
,
and
dismissed
the
vehicle
,
and
walked
towards
Todgers
's
.
   
<EOS>
Though
the
face
,
and
form
,
and
gait
of
this
old
man
,
and
even
his
grip
of
the
stout
stick
on
which
he
leaned
,
were
all
expressive
of
a
resolution
not
easily
shaken
,
and
a
purpose
(
it
matters
little
<EOS>
whether
right
or
wrong
,
just
now
)
such
as
in
other
days
might
have
survived
the
rack
,
and
had
its
strongest
life
in
weakest
death
;
still
there
were
grains
of
hesitation
in
his
mind
,
which
made
him
now
avoid
the
house
he
sought
,
and
loiter
to
and
fro
in
a
gleam
of
sunlight
,
that
brightened
the
little
churchyard
hard
by
.
 
<EOS>
There
may
have
been
,
in
the
presence
of
those
idle
heaps
of
dust
among
the
busiest
stir
of
life
,
something
to
increase
his
wavering
;
but
there
he
walked
,
awakening
the
echoes
as
he
paced
up
and
down
,
until
the
church
clock
,
striking
the
quarters
for
the
second
time
since
he
had
been
there
,
roused
him
from
his
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
Shaking
off
his
incertitude
as
the
air
parted
with
the
sound
of
the
bells
,
he
walked
rapidly
to
the
house
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
seated
in
the
landlady
's
little
room
,
and
his
visitor
found
him
reading
---
by
an
accident
;
he
apologised
for
it
---
an
excellent
theological
work
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
cake
and
wine
upon
a
little
table
---
by
another
accident
,
for
which
he
also
apologised
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
said
,
he
had
given
his
visitor
up
,
and
was
about
to
partake
of
that
simple
refreshment
with
his
children
,
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
daughters
are
well
?
<EOS>
"
said
old
Martin
,
laying
down
his
hat
and
stick
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
endeavoured
to
conceal
his
agitation
as
a
father
when
he
answered
Yes
,
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
good
girls
,
he
said
,
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
venture
to
recommend
Mr
Chuzzlewit
to
take
the
easy
-
chair
,
or
to
keep
out
of
the
draught
from
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
made
any
such
suggestion
,
he
would
expose
himself
,
he
feared
,
to
most
unjust
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
,
therefore
,
content
himself
with
remarking
that
there
was
an
easy
-
chair
in
the
room
,
and
that
the
door
was
far
from
being
air
-
tight
.
 
<EOS>
This
latter
imperfection
,
he
might
perhaps
venture
to
add
,
was
not
uncommonly
to
be
met
with
in
old
houses
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
sat
down
in
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
after
a
few
moments
'
silence
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
let
me
thank
you
for
coming
to
London
so
promptly
,
at
my
almost
unexplained
request
;
I
need
scarcely
add
,
at
my
cost
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
YOUR
cost
,
my
good
sir
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
,
"
said
Martin
,
waving
his
hand
impatiently
,
"
my
habit
to
put
my
---
well
!
<EOS>
my
relatives
---
to
any
personal
expense
to
gratify
my
caprices
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Caprices

good
sir

cried
Mr
Pecksniff
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
scarcely
the
proper
word
either
,
in
this
instance
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
inwardly
very
much
relieved
to
hear
it
,
though
he
did
n't
at
all
know
why
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
repeated
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
a
caprice
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
built
up
on
reason
,
proof
,
and
cool
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
Caprices
never
are
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
am
not
a
capricious
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Most
assuredly
not
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
"
returned
the
other
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
begin
to
know
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
to
test
and
prove
it
,
in
time
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
yours
are
to
find
that
I
can
be
constant
,
and
am
not
to
be
diverted
from
my
end
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
very
much
regret
,
"
Martin
resumed
,
looking
steadily
at
him
,
and
speaking
in
a
slow
and
measured
tone
;
"
I
very
much
regret
that
you
and
I
held
such
a
conversation
together
,
as
that
which
passed
between
us
at
our
last
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
I
very
much
regret
that
I
laid
open
to
you
what
were
then
my
thoughts
of
you
,
so
freely
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
The
intentions
that
I
bear
towards
you
now
are
of
another
kind
;
deserted
by
all
in
whom
I
have
ever
trusted
;
hoodwinked
and
beset
by
all
who
should
help
and
sustain
me
;
I
fly
to
you
for
refuge
.
 
<EOS>
I
confide
in
you
to
be
my
ally
;
to
attach
yourself
to
me
by
ties
of
Interest
and
Expectation
"
---
he
laid
great
stress
upon
these
words
,
though
Mr
Pecksniff
particularly
begged
him
not
to
mention
it
;
"
and
to
help
me
to
visit
the
consequences
of
the
very
worst
species
of
meanness
,
dissimulation
,
and
subtlety
,
on
the
right
heads
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
noble
sir
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
catching
at
his
outstretched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
YOU
regret
the
having
harboured
unjust
thoughts
of
me
!
<EOS>
YOU
with
those
grey
hairs
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Regrets
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
are
the
natural
property
of
grey
hairs
;
and
I
enjoy
,
in
common
with
all
other
men
,
at
least
my
share
of
such
inheritance
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
enough
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
regret
having
been
severed
from
you
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
known
you
sooner
,
and
sooner
used
you
as
you
well
deserve
,
I
might
have
been
a
happier
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
looked
up
to
the
ceiling
,
and
clasped
his
hands
in
rapture
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
daughters
,
"
said
Martin
,
after
a
short
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
them
.
 
<EOS>
Are
they
like
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
nose
of
my
eldest
and
the
chin
of
my
youngest
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
returned
the
widower
,
"
their
sainted
parent
(
not
myself
,
their
mother
)
lives
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
in
person
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Morally
,
morally
.
"
   
"
'
Tis
not
for
me
to
say
,
"
retorted
Mr
Pecksniff
with
a
gentle
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
my
best
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
wish
to
see
them
,
"
said
Martin
;
"
are
they
near
at
hand
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
,
very
near
;
for
they
had
in
fact
been
listening
at
the
door
from
the
beginning
of
this
conversation
until
now
,
when
they
precipitately
retired
.
 
<EOS>
Having
wiped
the
signs
of
weakness
from
his
eyes
,
and
so
given
them
time
to
get
upstairs
,
Mr
Pecksniff
opened
the
door
,
and
mildly
cried
in
the
passage
,
   
"
<EOS>
My
own
darlings
,
where
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
my
dear
pa
!
"
replied
the
distant
voice
of
Charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
down
into
the
back
parlour
,
if
you
please
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
and
bring
your
sister
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
pa
,
"
cried
Merry
;
and
down
they
came
directly
(
being
all
obedience
)
,
singing
as
they
came
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
could
exceed
the
astonishment
of
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
when
they
found
a
stranger
with
their
dear
papa
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
surpass
their
mute
amazement
when
he
said
,
"
My
children
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
when
he
told
them
that
Mr
Chuzzlewit
and
he
were
friends
,
and
that
Mr
Chuzzlewit
had
said
such
kind
and
tender
words
as
pierced
his
very
heart
,
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
cried
with
one
accord
,
"
Thank
Heaven
for
this
!
"
and
fell
upon
the
old
man
's
neck
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
had
embraced
him
with
such
fervour
of
affection
that
no
words
can
describe
it
,
they
grouped
themselves
about
his
chair
,
and
hung
over
him
,
as
figuring
to
themselves
no
earthly
joy
like
that
of
ministering
to
his
wants
,
and
crowding
into
the
remainder
of
his
life
,
the
love
they
would
have
diffused
over
their
whole
existence
,
from
infancy
,
if
he
---
dear
obdurate
!
---
<EOS>
had
but
consented
to
receive
the
precious
offering
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
attentively
from
one
to
the
other
,
and
then
at
Mr
Pecksniff
,
several
times
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
he
asked
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
happening
to
catch
his
eye
in
its
descent
;
for
until
now
it
had
been
piously
upraised
,
with
something
of
that
expression
which
the
poetry
of
ages
has
attributed
to
a
domestic
bird
,
when
breathing
its
last
amid
the
ravages
of
an
electric
storm
:
"
What
are
their
names
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
told
him
,
and
added
,
rather
hastily
;
his
caluminators
would
have
said
,
with
a
view
to
any
testamentary
thoughts
that
might
be
flitting
through
old
Martin
's
mind
;
"
Perhaps
,
my
dears
,
you
had
better
write
them
down
.
 
<EOS>
Your
humble
autographs
are
of
no
value
in
themselves
,
but
affection
may
prize
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Affection
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
will
expend
itself
on
the
living
originals
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
trouble
yourselves
,
my
girls
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
so
easily
forget
you
,
Charity
and
Mercy
,
as
to
need
such
tokens
of
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Cousin
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
alacrity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
never
sit
down
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
---
yes
---
occasionally
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
who
had
been
standing
all
this
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
do
so
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
ask
me
,
"
returned
Mr
Pecksniff
,
slipping
into
a
chair
immediately
,
"
whether
I
will
do
anything
that
you
desire
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
talk
confidently
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
and
you
mean
well
;
but
I
fear
you
do
n't
know
what
an
old
man
's
humours
are
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
be
required
to
court
his
likings
and
dislikings
;
to
adapt
yourself
to
his
prejudices
;
to
do
his
bidding
,
be
it
what
it
may
;
to
bear
with
his
distrusts
and
jealousies
;
and
always
still
be
zealous
in
his
service
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
remember
how
numerous
these
failings
are
in
me
,
and
judge
of
their
occasional
enormity
by
the
injurious
thoughts
I
lately
entertained
of
you
,
I
hardly
dare
to
claim
you
for
my
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
worthy
sir
,
"
returned
his
relative
,
"
how
CAN
you
talk
in
such
a
painful
strain
!
 
<EOS>
What
was
more
natural
than
that
you
should
make
one
slight
mistake
,
when
in
all
other
respects
you
were
so
very
correct
,
and
have
had
such
reason
---
such
very
sad
and
undeniable
reason
---
to
judge
of
every
one
about
you
in
the
worst
light
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
lenient
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
always
said
,
my
girls
and
I
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
with
increasing
obsequiousness
,
"
that
while
we
mourned
the
heaviness
of
our
misfortune
in
being
confounded
with
the
base
and
mercenary
,
still
we
could
not
wonder
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
dears
,
you
remember
?
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
vividly
!
 
<EOS>
A
thousand
times
!
   
<EOS>
"
We
uttered
no
complaint
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Occasionally
we
had
the
presumption
to
console
ourselves
with
the
remark
that
Truth
would
in
the
end
prevail
,
and
Virtue
be
triumphant
;
but
not
often
.
<EOS>
My
loves
,
you
recollect
?
"
   
<EOS>
Recollect
!
 
<EOS>
Could
he
doubt
it
!
 
<EOS>
Dearest
pa
,
what
strange
unnecessary
questions
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
saw
you
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
still
greater
deference
,
"
in
the
little
,
unassuming
village
where
we
take
the
liberty
of
dwelling
,
I
said
you
were
mistaken
in
me
,
my
dear
sir
;
that
was
all
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
---
not
all
,
"
said
Martin
,
who
had
been
sitting
with
his
hand
upon
his
brow
for
some
time
past
,
and
now
looked
up
again
;
"
you
said
much
more
,
which
,
added
to
other
circumstances
that
have
come
to
my
knowledge
,
opened
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
You
spoke
to
me
,
disinterestedly
,
on
behalf
of
---
<EOS>
I
need
n't
name
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
whom
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Trouble
was
expressed
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
visage
,
as
he
pressed
his
hot
hands
together
,
and
replied
,
with
humility
,
"
Quite
disinterestedly
,
sir
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
said
old
Martin
,
in
his
quiet
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
said
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
disinterested
too
,
in
you
,
to
draw
that
herd
of
harpies
off
from
me
,
and
be
their
victim
yourself
;
most
other
men
would
have
suffered
them
to
display
themselves
in
all
their
rapacity
,
and
would
have
striven
to
rise
,
by
contrast
,
in
my
estimation
.
 
<EOS>
You
felt
for
me
,
and
drew
them
off
,
for
which
I
owe
you
many
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
Although
I
left
the
place
,
I
know
what
passed
behind
my
back
,
you
see
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
amaze
me
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
;
which
was
true
enough
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
knowledge
of
your
proceedings
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
does
not
stop
at
this
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
new
inmate
in
your
house
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
architect
,
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
quit
it
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
---
for
yours
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
quavering
mildness
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
any
shelter
he
can
find
,
"
the
old
man
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
deceived
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
extremely
well
disposed
towards
that
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
can
not
be
shown
that
he
has
forfeited
all
claim
to
my
protection
.
 
<EOS>
Deceit
---
 
deceit
,
my
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
would
be
final
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
hold
myself
bound
,
on
proof
of
deceit
,
to
renounce
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
glanced
at
both
his
fair
supporters
,
but
especially
at
Miss
Mercy
,
whom
,
indeed
,
he
looked
full
in
the
face
,
with
a
greater
demonstration
of
interest
than
had
yet
appeared
in
his
features
.
<EOS>
His
gaze
again
encountered
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
he
said
,
composedly
:
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
know
that
he
has
made
his
matrimonial
choice
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
rubbing
his
hair
up
very
stiff
upon
his
head
,
and
staring
wildly
at
his
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
becoming
tremendous
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
fact
?
"
repeated
Martin
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
not
without
his
grandfather
's
consent
and
approbation
my
dear
sir
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
that
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
honour
of
human
nature
,
say
you
're
not
about
to
tell
me
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
had
suppressed
it
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
The
indignation
felt
by
Mr
Pecksniff
at
this
terrible
disclosure
,
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
kindling
anger
of
his
daughters
.
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
Had
they
taken
to
their
hearth
and
home
a
secretly
contracted
serpent
;
a
crocodile
,
who
had
made
a
furtive
offer
of
his
hand
;
an
imposition
on
society
;
a
bankrupt
bachelor
with
no
effects
,
trading
with
the
spinster
world
on
false
pretences
!
 
<EOS>
And
oh
,
to
think
that
he
should
have
disobeyed
and
practised
on
that
sweet
,
that
venerable
gentleman
,
whose
name
he
bore
;
that
kind
and
tender
guardian
;
his
more
than
father
---
to
say
nothing
at
all
of
mother
---
horrible
,
horrible
!
 
<EOS>
To
turn
him
out
with
ignominy
would
be
treatment
much
too
good
.
 
<EOS>
Was
there
nothing
else
that
could
be
done
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
Had
he
incurred
no
legal
pains
and
penalties
?
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
the
statutes
of
the
land
were
so
remiss
as
to
have
affixed
no
punishment
to
such
delinquency
?
 
<EOS>
Monster
;
how
basely
had
they
been
deceived
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
you
second
me
<EOS>
so
warmly
,
"
said
the
old
man
holding
up
his
hand
to
stay
the
torrent
of
their
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
deny
that
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
find
you
so
full
of
zeal
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
consider
that
topic
as
disposed
of
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
not
as
disposed
of
,
until
I
have
purged
my
house
of
this
pollution
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
will
follow
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
in
its
own
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
upon
that
as
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
sir
,
"
answered
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shaking
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
me
honour
.
 
<EOS>
You
MAY
look
upon
it
as
done
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
another
topic
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
<EOS>
on
which
I
hope
you
will
assist
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
Mary
,
cousin
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
young
lady
that
I
mentioned
to
you
,
my
dears
,
as
having
interested
me
so
very
much
,
"
remarked
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
my
interrupting
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
her
history
?
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
I
also
mentioned
,
you
will
recollect
,
my
dears
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Silly
girls
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
---
quite
moved
by
it
,
they
were
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look
now
!
"
said
Martin
,
evidently
pleased
;
"
I
feared
I
should
have
had
to
urge
her
case
upon
you
,
and
ask
you
to
regard
her
favourably
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
find
you
have
no
jealousies
!
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
You
have
no
cause
for
any
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
nothing
to
gain
from
me
,
my
dears
,
and
she
knows
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
murmured
their
approval
of
this
wise
arrangement
,
and
their
cordial
sympathy
with
its
interesting
object
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
have
anticipated
what
has
come
to
pass
between
us
four
,
"
said
the
old
man
thoughtfully
;
"
but
it
is
too
late
to
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
You
would
receive
her
courteously
,
young
ladies
,
and
be
kind
to
her
,
if
need
were
?
"
   
<EOS>
Where
was
the
orphan
whom
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
would
not
have
cherished
in
their
sisterly
bosom
!
 
<EOS>
But
when
that
orphan
was
commended
to
their
care
by
one
on
whom
the
dammed
-
up
love
of
years
was
gushing
forth
,
what
exhaustless
stores
of
pure
affection
yearned
to
expend
themselves
upon
her
!
   
<EOS>
An
interval
ensued
,
during
which
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
in
an
absent
frame
of
mind
,
sat
gazing
at
the
ground
,
without
uttering
a
word
;
and
as
it
was
plain
that
he
had
no
desire
to
be
interrupted
in
his
meditations
,
Mr
Pecksniff
and
his
daughters
were
profoundly
silent
also
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
the
foregoing
dialogue
,
he
had
borne
his
part
with
a
cold
,
passionless
promptitude
,
as
though
he
had
learned
and
painfully
rehearsed
it
all
a
hundred
times
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
his
expressions
were
warmest
and
his
language
most
encouraging
,
he
had
retained
the
same
manner
,
without
the
least
abatement
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
there
was
a
keener
brightness
in
his
eye
,
and
more
expression
in
his
voice
,
as
he
said
,
awakening
from
his
thoughtful
mood
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
will
be
said
of
this
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
reflected
?
"
   
"
Said
of
what
,
my
dear
sir
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
this
new
understanding
between
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
looked
benevolently
sagacious
,
and
at
the
same
time
far
above
all
earthly
misconstruction
,
as
he
shook
his
head
,
and
observed
that
a
great
many
things
would
be
said
of
it
,
no
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
great
many
,
"
rejoined
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
will
say
that
I
dote
in
my
old
age
;
that
illness
has
shaken
me
;
that
I
have
lost
all
strength
of
mind
,
and
have
grown
childish
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
bear
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
answered
that
it
would
be
dreadfully
hard
to
bear
,
but
he
thought
he
could
,
if
he
made
a
great
effort
.
   
<EOS>
"
Others
will
say
---
<EOS>
I
speak
of
disappointed
,
angry
people
only
---
that
you
have
lied
and
fawned
,
and
wormed
yourself
through
dirty
ways
into
my
favour
;
by
such
concessions
and
such
crooked
deeds
,
such
meannesses
and
vile
endurances
,
as
nothing
could
repay
;
no
,
not
the
legacy
of
half
the
world
we
live
in
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
bear
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
made
reply
that
this
would
be
also
very
hard
to
bear
,
as
reflecting
,
in
some
degree
,
on
the
discernment
of
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
<EOS>
Still
he
had
a
modest
confidence
that
he
could
sustain
the
calumny
,
with
the
help
of
a
good
conscience
,
and
that
gentleman
's
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
great
mass
of
slanderers
,
"
said
old
Martin
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
"
the
tale
,
as
I
clearly
foresee
,
will
run
thus
:
That
to
mark
my
contempt
for
the
rabble
<EOS>
whom
I
despised
,
I
chose
from
among
them
the
very
worst
,
and
made
him
do
my
will
,
and
pampered
and
enriched
him
at
the
cost
of
all
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
after
casting
about
for
the
means
of
a
punishment
which
should
rankle
in
the
bosoms
of
these
kites
the
most
,
and
strike
into
their
gall
,
I
devised
this
scheme
at
a
time
when
the
last
link
in
the
chain
of
grateful
love
and
duty
,
that
held
me
to
my
race
,
was
roughly
snapped
asunder
;
roughly
,
for
I
loved
him
well
;
roughly
,
for
I
had
ever
put
my
trust
in
his
affection
;
roughly
,
for
that
he
broke
it
when
I
loved
him
most
<EOS>
---
God
help
me
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
he
without
a
pang
could
throw
me
off
,
while
I
clung
about
his
heart
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
dismissing
this
passionate
outburst
as
suddenly
as
he
had
yielded
to
it
,
"
is
your
mind
made
up
to
bear
this
likewise
?
 
<EOS>
Lay
your
account
with
having
it
to
bear
,
and
put
no
trust
in
being
set
right
by
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
cried
Pecksniff
in
an
ecstasy
,
"
for
such
a
man
as
you
have
shown
yourself
to
be
this
day
;
for
a
man
so
injured
,
yet
so
very
humane
;
for
a
man
so
---
I
am
at
a
loss
what
precise
term
to
use
---
yet
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
so
remarkably
---
I
do
n't
know
how
to
express
my
meaning
;
for
such
a
man
as
I
have
described
,
I
hope
it
is
no
presumption
to
say
that
I
,
and
I
am
sure
I
may
add
my
children
also
<EOS>
(
my
dears
,
we
perfectly
agree
in
this
,
I
think
?
)
,
would
bear
anything
whatever
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
charge
no
consequences
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
do
you
retire
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whenever
you
please
,
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
night
if
you
desire
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
desire
nothing
,
"
returned
the
old
man
,
"
that
is
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Such
a
request
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
be
ready
to
return
at
the
end
of
this
week
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
very
time
of
all
others
that
Mr
Pecksniff
would
have
suggested
if
it
had
been
left
to
him
to
make
his
own
choice
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
his
daughters
---
the
words
,
"
Let
us
be
at
home
on
Saturday
,
dear
pa
,
"
were
actually
upon
their
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
expenses
,
cousin
,
"
said
Martin
,
taking
a
folded
slip
of
paper
from
his
pocketbook
,
"
may
possibly
exceed
that
amount
.
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
let
me
know
the
balance
that
I
owe
you
,
when
we
next
meet
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
useless
if
I
told
you
where
I
live
just
now
;
indeed
,
I
have
no
fixed
abode
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
have
,
you
shall
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
your
daughters
may
expect
to
see
me
before
long
;
in
the
meantime
I
need
not
tell
you
that
we
keep
our
own
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
will
do
when
you
get
home
is
understood
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
no
account
of
it
at
any
time
;
and
never
refer
to
it
in
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
that
as
a
favour
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
commonly
a
man
of
few
words
,
cousin
;
and
all
that
need
be
said
just
now
is
said
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
glass
of
wine
---
one
morsel
of
this
homely
cake
?
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
venturing
to
detain
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dears
---
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
sisters
flew
to
wait
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
girls
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
their
agitation
,
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
made
up
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
A
bad
commodity
to
go
through
the
world
with
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
!
 
<EOS>
My
youngest
daughter
is
almost
as
much
of
a
woman
as
my
eldest
,
is
she
not
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
IS
the
youngest
?
"
asked
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mercy
,
by
five
years
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
sometimes
venture
to
consider
her
rather
a
fine
figure
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Speaking
as
an
artist
,
I
may
perhaps
be
permitted
to
suggest
that
its
outline
is
graceful
and
correct
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
naturally
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
drying
his
hands
upon
his
handkerchief
,
and
looking
anxiously
in
his
cousin
's
face
at
almost
every
word
,
"
proud
,
if
I
may
use
the
expression
,
to
have
a
daughter
who
is
constructed
on
the
best
models
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
seems
to
have
a
lively
disposition
,
"
observed
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
quite
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
defined
her
character
,
my
dear
sir
,
as
correctly
as
if
you
had
known
her
from
her
birth
.
 
<EOS>
She
HAS
a
lively
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
in
our
unpretending
home
her
gaiety
is
delightful
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
returned
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charity
,
upon
the
other
hand
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
is
remarkable
for
strong
sense
,
and
for
rather
a
deep
tone
of
sentiment
,
if
the
partiality
of
a
father
may
be
excused
in
saying
so
.
 
<EOS>
A
wonderful
affection
between
them
,
my
dear
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
drink
your
health
.
<EOS>
Bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
little
thought
,
"
retorted
Martin
,
"
but
a
month
ago
,
that
I
should
be
breaking
bread
and
pouring
wine
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
drink
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Not
at
all
abashed
by
the
extraordinary
abruptness
with
which
these
latter
words
were
spoken
,
Mr
Pecksniff
thanked
him
devoutly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
let
me
go
,
"
said
Martin
,
putting
down
the
wine
when
he
had
merely
touched
it
with
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dears
,
good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
But
this
distant
form
of
farewell
was
by
no
means
tender
enough
for
the
yearnings
of
the
young
ladies
,
who
again
embraced
him
with
all
their
hearts
---
with
all
their
arms
at
any
rate
---
to
which
parting
caresses
their
new
-
found
friend
submitted
with
a
better
grace
than
might
have
been
expected
from
one
who
,
not
a
moment
before
,
had
pledged
their
parent
in
such
a
very
uncomfortable
manner
.
 
<EOS>
These
endearments
terminated
,
he
took
a
hasty
leave
of
Mr
Pecksniff
and
withdrew
,
followed
to
the
door
by
both
father
and
daughters
,
who
stood
there
kissing
their
hands
and
beaming
with
affection
until
he
disappeared
;
though
,
by
the
way
,
he
never
once
looked
back
,
after
he
had
crossed
the
threshold
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
returned
into
the
house
,
and
were
again
alone
in
Mrs
Todgers
's
room
,
the
two
young
ladies
exhibited
an
unusual
amount
of
gaiety
;
insomuch
that
they
clapped
their
hands
,
and
laughed
,
and
looked
with
roguish
aspects
and
a
bantering
air
upon
their
dear
papa
.
 
<EOS>
This
conduct
was
so
very
unaccountable
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
(
being
singularly
grave
himself
)
could
scarcely
choose
but
ask
them
what
it
meant
;
and
took
them
to
task
,
in
his
gentle
manner
,
for
yielding
to
such
light
emotions
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
possible
to
divine
any
cause
for
this
merriment
,
even
the
most
remote
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
should
not
reprove
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
you
can
have
none
<EOS>
whatever
---
<EOS>
oh
,
really
,
really
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
admonition
had
so
little
effect
on
Mercy
,
that
she
was
obliged
to
hold
her
handkerchief
before
her
rosy
lips
,
and
to
throw
herself
back
in
her
chair
,
with
every
demonstration
of
extreme
amusement
;
which
want
of
duty
<EOS>
so
offended
Mr
Pecksniff
that
he
reproved
her
in
set
terms
,
and
gave
her
his
parental
advice
to
correct
herself
in
solitude
and
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
that
juncture
they
were
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
voices
in
dispute
;
and
as
it
proceeded
from
the
next
room
,
the
subject
matter
of
the
altercation
quickly
reached
their
ears
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
that
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
said
the
young
gentleman
who
had
been
the
youngest
gentleman
in
company
on
the
day
of
the
festival
;
"
I
do
n't
care
THAT
,
ma'am
,
"
said
he
,
snapping
his
fingers
,
"
for
Jinkins
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
I
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
certain
you
do
n't
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
too
independent
a
spirit
,
I
know
,
to
yield
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
And
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
reason
why
you
should
give
way
to
any
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Everybody
must
be
well
aware
of
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
no
more
of
admitting
daylight
into
the
fellow
,
"
said
the
youngest
gentleman
,
in
a
desperate
voice
,
"
than
if
he
was
a
bulldog
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
did
not
stop
to
inquire
whether
,
as
a
matter
of
principle
,
there
was
any
particular
reason
for
admitting
daylight
even
into
a
bulldog
,
otherwise
than
by
the
natural
channel
of
his
eyes
,
but
she
seemed
to
wring
her
hands
,
and
she
moaned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
be
careful
,
"
said
the
youngest
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
give
him
warning
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
shall
step
between
me
and
the
current
of
my
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
a
Cove
---
"
he
used
that
familiar
epithet
in
his
agitation
but
corrected
himself
by
adding
,
"
a
gentleman
of
property
,
I
mean
---
who
practices
with
a
pair
of
pistols
(
fellows
too
)
of
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
driven
to
borrow
'em
,
and
to
send
at
friend
to
Jinkins
,
a
tragedy
will
get
into
the
papers
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Mrs
Todgers
moaned
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
borne
this
long
enough
,
"
said
the
youngest
gentleman
<EOS>
but
now
my
soul
rebels
against
it
,
and
I
wo
n't
stand
it
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
home
originally
,
because
I
had
that
within
me
which
would
n't
be
domineered
over
by
a
sister
;
and
do
you
think
I
'm
going
to
be
put
down
by
HIM
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
wrong
in
Mr
Jinkins
;
I
know
it
is
perfectly
inexcusable
in
Mr
Jinkins
,
if
he
intends
it
,
"
observed
Mrs
Todgers
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
intends
it
!
"
cried
the
youngest
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
he
interrupt
and
contradict
me
on
every
occasion
?
 
<EOS>
Does
he
ever
fail
to
interpose
himself
between
me
and
anything
or
anybody
that
he
sees
I
have
set
my
mind
upon
?
 
<EOS>
Does
he
make
a
point
of
always
pretending
to
forget
me
,
when
he
's
pouring
out
the
beer
?
 
<EOS>
Does
he
make
bragging
remarks
about
his
razors
,
and
insulting
allusions
to
people
who
have
no
necessity
to
shave
more
than
once
a
week
?
 
<EOS>
But
let
him
look
out
!
<EOS>
He
'll
find
himself
shaved
,
pretty
close
,
before
long
,
and
so
I
tell
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
was
mistaken
in
this
closing
sentence
,
inasmuch
as
he
never
told
it
to
Jinkins
,
but
always
to
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
"
he
said
,
"
these
are
not
proper
subjects
for
ladies
'
ears
.
<EOS>
All
I
've
got
to
say
to
you
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
is
,
a
week
's
notice
from
next
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
house
ca
n't
contain
that
miscreant
and
me
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
get
over
the
intermediate
time
without
bloodshed
,
you
may
think
yourself
pretty
fortunate
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
myself
expect
we
shall
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
!
"
cried
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
what
would
I
have
given
to
have
prevented
this
?
 
<EOS>
To
lose
you
,
sir
,
would
be
like
losing
the
house
's
right
-
hand
.
 
<EOS>
So
popular
as
you
are
among
the
gentlemen
;
so
generally
looked
up
to
;
and
so
much
liked
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
hope
you
'll
think
better
of
it
;
if
on
nobody
else
's
account
,
on
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
Jinkins
,
"
said
the
youngest
gentleman
,
moodily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
console
you
,
and
the
gentlemen
too
,
for
the
loss
of
twenty
such
as
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
understood
in
this
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
have
been
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
run
away
with
that
opinion
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Todgers
,
with
a
show
of
honest
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
make
such
a
charge
as
that
against
the
establishment
,
I
must
beg
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
so
bad
as
that
comes
to
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Make
any
remark
you
please
against
the
gentlemen
,
or
against
me
;
but
do
n't
say
you
're
not
understood
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
treated
as
if
I
was
,
"
said
the
youngest
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
you
make
a
great
mistake
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Todgers
,
in
the
same
strain
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
many
of
the
gentlemen
and
I
have
often
said
,
you
are
too
sensitive
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
where
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
of
too
susceptible
a
nature
;
it
's
in
your
spirit
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
as
to
Mr
Jinkins
,
I
must
beg
of
you
,
if
we
ARE
to
part
,
to
understand
that
I
do
n't
abet
Mr
Jinkins
by
any
means
.
 
<EOS>
Far
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
wish
that
Mr
Jinkins
would
take
a
lower
tone
in
this
establishment
,
and
would
not
be
the
means
of
raising
differences
between
me
and
gentlemen
that
I
can
much
less
bear
to
part
with
than
I
could
with
Mr
Jinkins
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jinkins
is
not
such
a
boarder
,
sir
,
"
added
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
that
all
considerations
of
private
feeling
and
respect
give
way
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
the
contrary
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
was
so
much
mollified
by
these
and
similar
speeches
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Todgers
,
that
he
and
that
lady
gradually
changed
positions
;
so
that
she
became
the
injured
party
,
and
he
was
understood
to
be
the
injurer
;
but
in
a
complimentary
,
not
in
an
offensive
sense
;
his
cruel
conduct
being
attributable
to
his
exalted
nature
,
and
to
that
alone
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
in
the
end
,
the
young
gentleman
withdrew
his
notice
,
and
assured
Mrs
Todgers
of
his
unalterable
regard
;
and
having
done
so
,
went
back
to
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
Goodness
me
,
Miss
Pecksniffs
!
"
cried
that
lady
,
as
she
came
into
the
back
room
,
and
sat
wearily
down
,
with
her
basket
on
her
knees
,
and
her
hands
folded
upon
it
,
"
what
a
trial
of
temper
it
is
to
keep
a
house
like
this
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
have
heard
most
of
what
has
just
passed
.
<EOS>
Now
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
said
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
all
the
ridiculous
young
fellows
that
ever
I
had
to
deal
with
,
"
resumed
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
that
is
the
most
ridiculous
and
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jinkins
is
hard
upon
him
sometimes
,
but
not
half
as
hard
as
he
deserves
.
 
<EOS>
To
mention
such
a
gentleman
as
Mr
Jinkins
in
the
same
breath
with
HIM
---
you
know
it
's
too
much
!
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
's
as
jealous
of
him
<EOS>
,
bless
you
,
as
if
he
was
his
equal
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
were
greatly
entertained
by
Mrs
Todgers
's
account
,
no
less
than
with
certain
anecdotes
illustrative
of
the
youngest
gentleman
's
character
,
which
she
went
on
to
tell
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pecksniff
looked
quite
stern
and
angry
;
and
when
she
had
concluded
,
said
in
a
solemn
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
if
I
may
inquire
,
what
does
that
young
gentleman
contribute
towards
the
support
of
these
premises
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
for
what
HE
has
,
he
pays
about
eighteen
shillings
a
week
!
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eighteen
shillings
a
week
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Taking
one
week
with
another
;
as
near
that
as
possible
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
rose
from
his
chair
,
folded
his
arms
,
looked
at
her
,
and
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
do
you
mean
to
say
,
ma'am
---
is
it
possible
,
Mrs
Todgers
---
that
for
such
a
miserable
consideration
as
eighteen
shillings
a
week
,
a
female
of
your
understanding
can
so
far
demean
herself
as
to
wear
a
double
face
,
even
for
an
instant
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
forced
to
keep
things
on
the
square
if
I
can
,
sir
,
"
faltered
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
preserve
peace
among
them
,
and
keep
my
connection
together
,
if
possible
,
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
The
profit
is
very
small
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
profit
!
"
cried
that
gentleman
,
laying
great
stress
upon
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
profit
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
 
<EOS>
You
amaze
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
so
severe
,
that
Mrs
Todgers
shed
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
profit
!
"
repeated
Mr
pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
profit
of
dissimulation
!
<EOS>
To
worship
the
golden
calf
of
Baal
,
for
eighteen
shillings
a
week
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
in
your
own
goodness
be
too
hard
upon
me
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
cried
Mrs
Todgers
,
taking
out
her
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
Calf
,
Calf
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Baal
,
Baal
!
<EOS>
oh
my
friend
,
Mrs
Todgers

<EOS>

barter
away
that
precious
jewel
,
self
-
esteem
,
and
cringe
to
any
mortal
creature
---
for
eighteen
shillings
a
week
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
so
subdued
and
overcome
by
the
reflection
,
that
he
immediately
took
down
his
hat
from
its
peg
in
the
passage
,
and
went
out
for
a
walk
,
to
compose
his
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
Anybody
passing
him
in
the
street
might
have
known
him
for
a
good
man
at
first
sight
;
for
his
whole
figure
teemed
with
a
consciousness
of
the
moral
homily
he
had
read
to
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
Eighteen
shillings
a
week
!
 
<EOS>
Just
,
most
just
,
thy
censure

upright
Pecksniff

Had
it
been
for
the
sake
of
a
ribbon

star

garter

sleeves
of
lawn

a
great

oh

Chapter
11
.
<EOS>
Wherein
a
certain
gentleman
becomes
particular
in
his
attentions
to
a
certain
lady
;
and
more
coming
events
than
one
,
cast
their
shadows
before
 
The
family
were
within
two
or
three
days
of
their
departure
from
Mrs
Todgers
's
,
and
the
commercial
gentlemen
were
to
a
man
despondent
and
not
to
be
comforted
,
because
of
the
approaching
separation
,
when
Bailey
junior
,
at
the
jocund
time
of
noon
,
presented
himself
before
Miss
Charity
Pecksniff
,
then
sitting
with
her
sister
in
the
banquet
chamber
,
hemming
six
new
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
for
Mr
Jinkins
;
and
having
expressed
a
hope
,
preliminary
and
pious
,
that
he
might
be
blest
,
gave
her
in
his
pleasant
way
to
understand
that
a
visitor
attended
to
pay
his
respects
to
her
,
and
was
at
that
moment
waiting
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
last
announcement
showed
in
a
more
striking
point
of
view
than
many
lengthened
speeches
could
have
done
,
the
trustfulness
and
faith
of
Bailey
's
nature
;
since
he
had
,
in
fact
,
last
seen
the
visitor
on
the
door
-
mat
,
where
,
after
signifying
to
him
that
he
would
do
well
to
go
upstairs
,
he
had
left
him
to
the
guidance
of
his
own
sagacity
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
it
was
at
least
an
even
chance
that
the
visitor
was
then
wandering
on
the
roof
of
the
house
,
or
vainly
seeking
to
extricate
himself
from
the
maze
of
bedrooms
;
Todgers
's
being
precisely
that
kind
of
establishment
in
which
an
unpiloted
stranger
is
pretty
sure
to
find
himself
in
some
place
where
he
least
expects
and
least
desires
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
for
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Charity
,
pausing
in
her
work
;
"
my
gracious
,
Bailey
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
IS
my
gracious
,
an't
it
?
 
<EOS>
Would
n't
I
be
gracious
neither
,
not
if
I
wos
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
remark
was
rendered
somewhat
obscure
in
itself
,
by
reason
(
as
the
reader
may
have
observed
)
of
a
redundancy
of
negatives
;
but
accompanied
by
action
expressive
of
a
faithful
couple
walking
arm
-
in
-
arm
towards
a
parochial
church
,
mutually
exchanging
looks
of
love
,
it
clearly
signified
this
youth
's
conviction
that
the
caller
's
purpose
was
of
an
amorous
tendency
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
affected
to
reprove
so
great
a
liberty
;
but
she
could
not
help
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
strange
boy
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
always
some
ground
of
probability
and
likelihood
mingled
with
his
absurd
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
best
of
it
!
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
any
gentlemen
,
Bailey
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
must
have
made
a
mistake
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
smiled
at
the
extreme
wildness
of
such
a
supposition
,
and
regarded
the
young
ladies
with
unimpaired
affability
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Merry
,
"
said
Charity
,
"
who
CAN
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
odd
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
mind
not
to
go
to
him
really
.
 
<EOS>
So
very
strange
,
you
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
younger
sister
plainly
considered
that
this
appeal
had
its
origin
in
the
pride
of
being
called
upon
and
asked
for
;
and
that
it
was
intended
as
an
assertion
of
superiority
,
and
a
retaliation
upon
her
for
having
captured
the
commercial
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
she
replied
,
with
great
affection
and
politeness
,
that
it
was
,
no
doubt
,
very
strange
indeed
;
and
that
she
was
totally
at
a
loss
to
conceive
what
the
ridiculous
person
unknown
could
mean
by
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
impossible
to
divine
!
"
said
Charity
,
with
some
sharpness
,
"
though
still
,
at
the
same
time
,
you
need
n't
be
angry
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
retorted
Merry
,
singing
at
her
needle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
aware
of
that
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
your
head
is
turned
,
you
silly
thing
,
"
said
Cherry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Merry
,
with
engaging
candour
,
"
that
I
have
been
afraid
of
that
,
myself
,
all
along
!
 
<EOS>
So
much
incense
and
nonsense
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
is
enough
to
turn
a
stronger
head
than
mine
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
relief
it
must
be
to
you
,
my
dear
,
to
be
so
very
comfortable
in
that
respect
,
and
not
to
be
worried
by
those
odious
men
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
it
,
Cherry
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
artless
inquiry
might
have
led
to
turbulent
results
,
but
for
the
strong
emotions
of
delight
evinced
by
Bailey
junior
,
whose
relish
in
the
turn
the
conversation
had
lately
taken
was
so
acute
,
that
it
impelled
and
forced
him
to
the
instantaneous
performance
of
a
dancing
step
,
extremely
difficult
in
its
nature
,
and
only
to
be
achieved
in
a
moment
of
ecstasy
,
which
is
commonly
called
The
Frog
's
Hornpipe
.
 
<EOS>
A
manifestation
so
lively
,
brought
to
their
immediate
recollection
the
great
virtuous
precept
,
"
Keep
up
appearances
whatever
you
do
,
"
in
which
they
had
been
educated
.
 
<EOS>
They
forbore
at
once
,
and
jointly
signified
to
Mr
Bailey
that
if
he
should
presume
to
practice
that
figure
any
more
in
their
presence
,
they
would
instantly
acquaint
Mrs
Todgers
with
the
fact
,
and
would
demand
his
condign
punishment
,
at
the
hands
of
that
lady
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
having
expressed
the
bitterness
of
his
contrition
by
affecting
to
wipe
away
scalding
tears
with
his
apron
,
and
afterwards
feigning
to
wring
a
vast
amount
of
water
from
that
garment
,
held
the
door
open
while
Miss
Charity
passed
out
;
and
so
that
damsel
went
in
state
upstairs
to
receive
her
mysterious
adorer
.
   
<EOS>
By
some
strange
occurrence
of
favourable
circumstances
he
had
found
out
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
was
sitting
there
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
cousin
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
You
thought
I
was
lost
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
how
do
you
find
yourself
by
this
time
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
replied
that
she
was
quite
well
,
and
gave
Mr
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
"
and
you
've
got
over
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
<EOS>
have
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
How
's
the
other
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
sister
is
very
well
,
I
believe
,
"
returned
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
heard
her
complain
of
any
indisposition
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
her
,
and
ask
her
yourself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
cousin
!
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
sitting
down
beside
her
on
the
window
-
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
occasion
for
that
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
cruel
girl
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
impossible
for
YOU
to
know
,
"
said
Cherry
,
"
whether
I
am
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
it
is
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
---
<EOS>
Did
you
think
I
was
lost
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
n't
told
me
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
think
at
all
about
it
,
"
answered
Cherry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
though
?
"
said
Jonas
,
pondering
upon
this
strange
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Did
the
other
one
?
"
   
"
I
am
sure
it
's
impossible
for
me
to
say
what
my
sister
may
,
or
may
not
have
thought
on
such
a
subject
,
"
cried
Cherry
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
never
said
anything
to
me
about
it
,
one
way
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
she
laugh
about
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
n't
even
laugh
about
it
,
"
answered
Charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
terrible
one
to
laugh
,
an't
she
?
"
said
Jonas
,
lowering
his
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
lively
,
"
said
Cherry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Liveliness
is
a
pleasant
thing
---
when
it
do
n't
lead
to
spending
money
.
 
<EOS>
An't
it
?
"
asked
Mr
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
much
so
,
indeed
,
"
said
Cherry
,
with
a
demureness
of
manner
that
gave
a
very
disinterested
character
to
her
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Such
liveliness
as
yours
<EOS>
I
mean
,
you
know
,
"
observed
Mr
Jonas
,
as
he
nudged
her
with
his
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
come
to
see
you
before
,
but
I
did
n't
know
where
you
was
.
 
<EOS>
How
quick
you
hurried
off
,
that
morning
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
amenable
to
my
papa
's
directions
,
"
said
Miss
Charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
had
given
me
his
direction
,
"
returned
her
cousin
,
"
and
then
I
should
have
found
you
out
before
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
should
n't
have
found
you
even
now
,
if
I
had
n't
met
him
in
the
street
this
morning
.
<EOS>
What
a
sleek
,
sly
chap
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
Just
like
a
tomcat
,
an't
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
trouble
you
to
have
the
goodness
to
speak
more
respectfully
of
my
papa
,
Mr
Jonas
,
"
said
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
allow
such
a
tone
as
that
,
even
in
jest
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
,
you
may
say
what
you
like
of
MY
father
,
then
,
and
so
I
give
you
leave
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
's
liquid
aggravation
that
circulates
through
his
veins
,
and
not
regular
blood
.
 
<EOS>
How
old
should
you
think
my
father
was
,
cousin
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Old
,
no
doubt
,
"
replied
Miss
Charity
;
"
but
a
fine
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
fine
old
gentleman
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Jonas
,
giving
the
crown
of
his
hat
an
angry
knock
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
time
he
was
thinking
of
being
drawn
out
a
little
finer
too
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
he
's
eighty
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
,
indeed
?
"
said
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
ecod
,
"
cried
Jonas
,
"
<EOS>
now
he
's
gone
so
far
without
giving
in
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
see
much
to
prevent
his
being
ninety
;
no
,
nor
even
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
Why
,
a
man
with
any
feeling
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
being
eighty
,
let
alone
more
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
his
religion
,
I
should
like
to
know
,
when
he
goes
flying
in
the
face
of
the
Bible
like
that
?
 
<EOS>
Threescore
-
and
-
ten
's
the
mark
,
and
no
man
with
a
conscience
,
and
a
proper
sense
of
what
's
expected
of
him
,
has
any
business
to
live
longer
.
"
   
<EOS>
Is
any
one
surprised
at
Mr
Jonas
making
such
a
reference
to
such
a
book
for
such
a
purpose
?
 
<EOS>
Does
any
one
doubt
the
old
saw
,
that
the
Devil
(
being
a
layman
)
quotes
Scripture
for
his
own
ends
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
will
take
the
trouble
to
look
about
him
,
he
may
find
a
greater
number
of
confirmations
of
the
fact
in
the
occurrences
of
any
single
day
,
than
the
steam
-
gun
can
discharge
balls
in
a
minute
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
there
's
enough
of
my
father
,
"
said
Jonas
;
"
it
's
of
no
use
to
go
putting
one
's
self
out
of
the
way
by
talking
about
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
to
ask
you
to
come
and
take
a
walk
,
cousin
,
and
see
some
of
the
sights
;
and
to
come
to
our
house
afterwards
,
and
have
a
bit
of
something
.
<EOS>
Pecksniff
will
most
likely
look
in
in
the
evening
,
he
says
,
and
bring
you
home
.
 
<EOS>
See
,
here
's
his
writing
;
I
made
him
put
it
down
this
morning
when
he
told
me
he
should
n't
be
back
before
I
came
here
;
in
case
you
would
n't
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
like
proof
,
is
there
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
---
you
'll
bring
the
other
one
,
you
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
cast
her
eyes
upon
her
father
's
autograph
,
which
merely
said
---
"
Go
,
my
children
,
with
your
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
Let
there
be
union
among
us
when
it
is
possible
;
"
and
after
enough
of
hesitation
to
impart
a
proper
value
to
her
consent
,
withdrew
to
prepare
her
sister
and
herself
for
the
excursion
.
 
<EOS>
She
soon
returned
,
accompanied
by
Miss
Mercy
,
who
was
by
no
means
pleased
to
leave
the
brilliant
triumphs
of
Todgers
's
for
the
society
of
Mr
Jonas
and
his
respected
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
cried
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
,
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
fright
,
"
said
Mercy
,
"
here
I
am
;
and
I
would
much
rather
be
anywhere
else
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
,
"
cried
Mr
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
n't
possible
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
what
opinion
you
like
,
fright
,
"
retorted
Mercy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
content
to
keep
mine
;
and
mine
is
that
you
are
a
very
unpleasant
,
odious
,
disagreeable
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
she
laughed
heartily
,
and
seemed
to
enjoy
herself
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
're
a
sharp
gal
!
"
said
Mr
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
regular
teaser
,
an't
<EOS>
she
,
cousin
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
replied
in
effect
,
that
she
was
unable
to
say
what
the
habits
and
propensities
of
a
regular
teaser
might
be
;
and
that
even
if
she
possessed
such
information
,
it
would
ill
become
her
to
admit
the
existence
of
any
creature
with
such
an
unceremonious
name
in
her
family
;
far
less
in
the
person
of
a
beloved
sister
;
"
whatever
,
"
added
Cherry
with
an
angry
glance
,
"
whatever
her
real
nature
may
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Merry
,
"
the
only
observation
I
have
to
make
is
,
that
if
we
do
n't
go
out
at
once
,
I
shall
certainly
take
my
bonnet
off
again
,
and
stay
at
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
threat
had
the
desired
effect
of
preventing
any
farther
altercation
,
for
Mr
Jonas
immediately
proposed
an
adjournment
,
and
the
same
being
carried
unanimously
,
they
departed
from
the
house
straightway
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
doorstep
,
Mr
Jonas
gave
an
arm
to
each
cousin
;
which
act
of
gallantry
being
observed
by
Bailey
junior
,
from
the
garret
window
,
was
by
him
saluted
with
a
loud
and
violent
fit
of
coughing
,
to
which
paroxysm
he
was
still
the
victim
when
they
turned
the
corner
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
inquired
in
the
first
instance
if
they
were
good
walkers
and
being
answered
,
"
Yes
,
"
submitted
their
pedestrian
powers
to
a
pretty
severe
test
;
for
he
showed
them
as
many
sights
,
in
the
way
of
bridges
,
churches
,
streets
,
outsides
of
theatres
,
and
other
free
spectacles
,
in
that
one
forenoon
,
as
most
people
see
in
a
twelvemonth
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
observable
in
this
gentleman
,
that
he
had
an
insurmountable
distaste
to
the
insides
of
buildings
,
and
that
he
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
merits
of
all
shows
,
in
respect
of
which
there
was
any
charge
for
admission
,
which
it
seemed
were
every
one
detestable
,
and
of
the
very
lowest
grade
of
merit
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
thoroughly
possessed
with
this
opinion
,
that
when
Miss
Charity
happened
to
mention
the
circumstance
of
their
having
been
twice
or
thrice
to
the
theatre
with
Mr
Jinkins
and
party
,
he
inquired
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
"
where
the
orders
came
from
?
"
and
being
told
that
Mr
Jinkins
and
party
paid
,
was
beyond
description
entertained
,
observing
that
"
they
must
be
nice
flats
,
certainly
;
"
and
often
in
the
course
of
the
walk
,
bursting
out
again
into
a
perfect
convulsion
of
laughter
at
the
surpassing
silliness
of
those
gentlemen
,
and
(
doubtless
)
at
his
own
superior
wisdom
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
had
been
out
for
some
hours
and
were
thoroughly
fatigued
,
it
being
by
that
time
twilight
<EOS>
,
Mr
Jonas
intimated
that
he
would
show
them
one
of
the
best
pieces
of
fun
with
which
he
was
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
This
joke
was
of
a
practical
kind
,
and
its
humour
lay
in
taking
a
hackney
-
coach
to
the
extreme
limits
of
possibility
for
a
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
Happily
it
brought
them
to
the
place
where
Mr
Jonas
dwelt
,
or
the
young
ladies
might
have
rather
missed
the
point
and
cream
of
the
jest
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
-
established
firm
of
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
and
Son
,
Manchester
Warehousemen
,
and
so
forth
,
had
its
place
of
business
in
a
very
narrow
street
somewhere
behind
the
Post
Office
;
where
every
house
was
in
the
brightest
summer
morning
very
gloomy
;
and
where
light
porters
watered
the
pavement
,
each
before
his
own
employer
's
premises
,
in
fantastic
patterns
,
in
the
dog
-
days
;
and
where
spruce
gentlemen
with
their
hands
in
the
pockets
of
symmetrical
trousers
,
were
always
to
be
seen
in
warm
weather
,
contemplating
their
undeniable
boots
in
dusty
warehouse
doorways
;
which
appeared
to
be
the
hardest
work
they
did
,
except
now
and
then
carrying
pens
behind
their
ears
.
 
<EOS>
A
dim
,
dirty
,
smoky
,
tumble
-
down
,
rotten
old
house
it
was
,
as
anybody
would
desire
to
see
;
but
<EOS>
there
the
firm
of
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
and
Son
transacted
all
their
business
and
their
pleasure
too
,
such
as
it
was
;
for
neither
the
young
man
nor
the
old
had
any
other
residence
,
or
any
care
or
thought
beyond
its
narrow
limits
.
   
<EOS>
Business
,
as
may
be
readily
supposed
,
was
the
main
thing
in
this
establishment
;
insomuch
indeed
that
it
shouldered
comfort
out
of
doors
,
and
jostled
the
domestic
arrangements
at
every
turn
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
in
the
miserable
bedrooms
there
were
files
of
moth
-
eaten
letters
hanging
up
against
the
walls
;
and
linen
rollers
,
and
fragments
of
old
patterns
,
and
odds
and
ends
of
spoiled
goods
,
strewed
upon
the
ground
;
while
the
meagre
bedsteads
,
washing
-
stands
,
and
scraps
of
carpet
,
were
huddled
away
into
corners
as
objects
of
secondary
consideration
,
not
to
be
thought
of
but
as
disagreeable
necessities
,
furnishing
no
profit
,
and
intruding
on
the
one
affair
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
single
sitting
-
room
was
on
the
same
principle
,
a
chaos
of
boxes
and
old
papers
,
and
had
more
counting
-
house
stools
in
it
than
chairs
;
not
to
mention
a
great
monster
of
a
desk
straddling
over
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
and
an
iron
safe
sunk
into
the
wall
above
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
The
solitary
little
table
for
purposes
of
refection
and
social
enjoyment
,
bore
as
fair
a
proportion
to
the
desk
and
other
business
furniture
,
as
the
graces
and
harmless
relaxations
of
life
had
ever
done
,
in
the
persons
of
the
old
man
and
his
son
,
to
their
pursuit
of
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
meanly
laid
out
now
for
dinner
;
and
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
sat
Anthony
himself
,
who
rose
to
greet
his
son
and
his
fair
cousins
as
they
entered
.
   
<EOS>
An
ancient
proverb
warns
us
that
we
should
not
expect
to
find
old
heads
upon
young
shoulders
;
to
which
it
may
be
added
that
we
seldom
meet
with
that
unnatural
combination
,
but
we
feel
a
strong
desire
to
knock
them
off
;
merely
from
an
inherent
love
we
have
of
seeing
things
in
their
right
places
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
improbable
that
many
men
,
in
no
wise
choleric
by
nature
,
felt
this
impulse
rising
up
within
them
,
when
they
first
made
the
acquaintance
of
Mr
Jonas
;
but
if
they
had
known
him
more
intimately
in
his
own
house
,
and
had
sat
with
him
at
his
own
board
,
it
would
assuredly
have
been
paramount
to
all
other
considerations
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ghost
!
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
dutifully
addressing
his
parent
by
that
title
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
dinner
nearly
ready
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
was
,
"
rejoined
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
good
of
that
?
"
<EOS>
rejoined
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
for
certain
,
"
said
Anthony
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
for
certain
,
"
rejoined
his
son
in
a
lower
tone
.
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
anything
for
certain
,
YOU
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
your
candle
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
it
for
the
gals
.
"
   
<EOS>
Anthony
handed
him
a
battered
old
office
candlestick
,
with
which
Mr
Jonas
preceded
the
young
ladies
to
the
nearest
bedroom
,
where
he
left
them
to
take
off
their
shawls
and
bonnets
;
and
returning
,
occupied
himself
in
opening
a
bottle
of
wine
,
sharpening
the
carving
-
knife
,
and
muttering
compliments
to
his
father
,
until
they
and
the
dinner
appeared
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
repast
consisted
of
a
hot
leg
of
mutton
with
greens
and
potatoes
;
and
the
dishes
having
been
set
upon
the
table
by
a
slipshod
old
woman
,
they
were
left
to
enjoy
it
after
their
own
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bachelor
's
Hall
,
you
know
,
cousin
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
to
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
---
the
other
one
will
be
having
a
laugh
at
this
when
she
gets
home
,
wo
n't
she
?
 
<EOS>
Here
;
you
sit
on
the
right
side
of
me
,
and
I
'll
have
her
upon
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
Other
one
,
will
you
come
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
such
a
fright
,
"
replied
Mercy
,
"
<EOS>
that
I
know
I
shall
have
no
appetite
if
I
sit
so
near
you
;
but
I
suppose
I
must
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
An't
she
lively
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mr
Jonas
to
the
elder
sister
,
with
his
favourite
elbow
emphasis
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
I
really
do
n't
know
!
"
replied
Miss
Pecksniff
,
tartly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
tired
of
being
asked
such
ridiculous
questions
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
precious
old
father
of
mine
about
now
?
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
seeing
that
his
parent
was
travelling
up
and
down
the
room
instead
of
taking
his
seat
at
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
looking
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
lost
my
glasses
,
Jonas
,
"
said
old
Anthony
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
without
your
glasses
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
returned
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
eat
or
drink
out
of
'em
,
I
think
;
and
where
's
that
sleepy
-
headed
old
Chuffey
got
to
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
stupid
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
know
your
name
,
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
seem
that
he
did
n't
,
for
he
did
n't
come
until
the
father
called
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
door
of
a
small
glass
office
,
which
was
partitioned
off
from
the
rest
of
the
room
,
was
slowly
opened
,
and
a
little
blear
-
eyed
,
weazen
-
faced
,
ancient
man
came
creeping
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
of
a
remote
fashion
,
and
dusty
,
like
the
rest
of
the
furniture
;
he
was
dressed
in
a
decayed
suit
of
black
;
with
breeches
garnished
at
the
knees
with
rusty
wisps
of
ribbon
,
the
very
paupers
of
shoestrings
;
on
the
lower
portion
of
his
spindle
legs
were
dingy
worsted
stockings
of
the
same
colour
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
as
if
he
had
been
put
away
and
forgotten
half
a
century
before
,
and
somebody
had
just
found
him
in
a
lumber
-
closet
.
   
<EOS>
Such
as
he
was
,
he
came
slowly
creeping
on
towards
the
table
,
until
at
last
he
crept
into
the
vacant
chair
,
from
which
,
as
his
dim
faculties
became
conscious
of
the
presence
of
strangers
,
and
those
strangers
ladies
,
he
rose
again
,
apparently
intending
to
make
a
bow
.
<EOS>
But
he
sat
down
once
more
without
having
made
it
,
and
breathing
on
his
shrivelled
hands
to
warm
them
,
remained
with
his
poor
blue
nose
immovable
above
his
plate
,
looking
at
nothing
,
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
,
and
a
face
that
meant
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Take
him
in
that
state
,
and
he
was
an
embodiment
of
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
clerk
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
as
host
and
master
of
the
ceremonies
:
"
Old
Chuffey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
deaf
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
one
of
the
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
know
that
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
He
an't
deaf
,
is
he
,
father
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
him
say
he
was
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Blind
?
"
inquired
the
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
"
N
---
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
understood
that
he
was
at
all
blind
,
"
said
Jonas
,
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
consider
him
so
,
do
you
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Anthony
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
he
is
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
apart
to
the
young
ladies
,
"
he
's
precious
old
,
for
one
thing
;
and
I
an't
best
pleased
with
him
for
that
<EOS>
,
for
I
think
my
father
must
have
caught
it
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
strange
old
chap
,
for
another
,
"
he
added
in
a
louder
voice
,
"
and
do
n't
understand
any
one
hardly
,
but
HIM
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
his
honoured
parent
with
the
carving
-
fork
,
in
order
that
they
might
know
whom
he
meant
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
very
strange
!
"
cried
the
sisters
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
"
he
's
been
addling
his
old
brains
with
figures
and
book
-
keeping
all
his
life
;
and
twenty
years
ago
<EOS>
or
so
he
went
and
took
a
fever
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
time
he
was
out
of
his
head
(
which
was
three
weeks
)
<EOS>
he
never
left
off
casting
up
;
and
he
got
to
so
many
million
at
last
that
I
do
n't
believe
he
's
ever
been
quite
right
since
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
do
much
business
now
though
,
and
he
an't
a
bad
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
good
one
,
"
said
Anthony
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
He
an't
<EOS>
a
dear
one
at
all
events
<EOS>
,
"
observed
Jonas
;
"
and
he
earns
his
salt
,
which
is
enough
for
our
look
-
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
telling
you
that
he
hardly
understands
any
one
except
my
father
;
he
always
understands
him
,
though
,
and
wakes
up
quite
wonderful
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
been
used
to
his
ways
so
long
,
you
see
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
've
seen
him
play
whist
,
with
my
father
for
a
partner
;
and
a
good
rubber
too
;
when
he
had
no
more
notion
what
sort
of
people
he
was
playing
against
,
than
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
he
no
appetite
?
"
asked
Merry
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Jonas
,
plying
his
own
knife
and
fork
very
fast
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
eats
---
when
he
's
helped
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
do
n't
care
whether
he
waits
a
minute
or
an
hour
,
as
long
as
father
's
here
;
so
<EOS>
when
I
'm
at
all
sharp
set
,
as
I
am
to
-
day
,
I
come
to
him
after
I
've
taken
the
edge
off
my
own
hunger
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Chuffey
,
stupid
,
are
you
ready
?
"
   
<EOS>
Chuffey
remained
immovable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Always
a
perverse
old
file
,
he
was
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
coolly
helping
himself
to
another
slice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
him
,
father
.
"
   
"
Are
you
ready
for
your
dinner
,
Chuffey
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
old
man
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
Chuffey
,
lighting
up
into
a
sentient
human
creature
at
the
first
sound
of
the
voice
,
so
that
it
was
at
once
a
curious
and
quite
a
moving
sight
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
ready
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
ready
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
All
ready
,
all
ready
,
all
ready
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
that
he
stopped
,
smilingly
,
and
listened
for
some
further
address
;
but
being
spoken
to
no
more
,
the
light
forsook
his
face
by
little
and
little
,
until
he
was
nothing
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
very
disagreeable
,
mind
,
"
said
Jonas
,
addressing
his
cousins
as
he
handed
the
old
man
's
portion
to
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
always
chokes
himself
when
it
an't
broth
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
him
,
now
!
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
a
horse
with
such
a
wall
-
eyed
expression
as
he
's
got
?
<EOS>
If
it
had
n't
been
for
the
joke
of
it
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
let
him
come
in
to
-
day
;
but
I
thought
he
'd
amuse
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
poor
old
subject
of
this
humane
speech
was
,
happily
for
himself
,
as
unconscious
of
its
purport
as
of
most
other
remarks
that
were
made
in
his
presence
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
mutton
being
tough
,
and
his
gums
weak
,
he
quickly
verified
the
statement
relative
to
his
choking
propensities
,
and
underwent
so
much
in
his
attempts
to
dine
,
that
Mr
Jonas
was
infinitely
amused
;
protesting
that
he
had
seldom
seen
him
better
company
in
all
his
life
,
and
that
he
was
enough
to
make
a
man
split
his
sides
with
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
went
so
far
as
to
assure
the
sisters
,
that
in
this
point
of
view
he
considered
Chuffey
superior
to
his
own
father
;
which
,
as
he
significantly
added
,
was
saying
a
great
deal
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
strange
enough
that
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
,
himself
so
old
a
man
,
should
take
a
pleasure
in
these
gibings
of
his
estimable
son
at
the
expense
of
the
poor
shadow
at
their
table
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
did
,
unquestionably
;
though
not
so
much
---
to
do
him
justice
---
with
reference
to
their
ancient
clerk
,
as
in
exultation
at
the
sharpness
of
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
same
reason
that
young
man
's
coarse
allusions
,
even
to
himself
,
filled
him
with
a
stealthy
glee
;
causing
him
to
rub
his
hands
and
chuckle
covertly
,
as
if
he
said
in
his
sleeve
,
"
I
taught
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
trained
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
heir
of
my
bringing
-
up
.
<EOS>
Sly
,
cunning
,
and
covetous
<EOS>
,
he
'll
not
squander
my
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
worked
for
this
;
I
hoped
for
this
;
it
has
been
the
great
end
and
aim
of
my
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
What
a
noble
end
<EOS>
and
aim
it
was
to
contemplate
in
the
attainment
truly
!
 
<EOS>
But
there
be
some
who
manufacture
idols
after
the
fashion
of
themselves
,
and
fail
to
worship
them
when
they
are
made
;
charging
their
deformity
on
outraged
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Anthony
was
better
than
these
at
any
rate
.
   
<EOS>
Chuffey
boggled
over
his
plate
so
long
,
that
Mr
Jones
,
losing
patience
,
took
it
from
him
at
last
with
his
own
hands
,
and
requested
his
father
to
signify
to
that
venerable
person
that
he
had
better
"
peg
away
at
his
bread
;
"
which
Anthony
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
!
"
cried
the
old
man
,
brightening
up
as
before
,
when
this
was
communicated
to
him
in
the
same
voice
,
"
quite
right
,
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
your
own
son
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
him
for
a
sharp
lad
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
him
,
bless
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
considered
this
so
particularly
childish
(
perhaps
with
some
reason
)
,
that
he
only
laughed
the
more
,
and
told
his
cousins
that
he
was
afraid
one
of
these
fine
days
,
Chuffey
would
be
the
death
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
then
removed
,
and
the
bottle
of
wine
set
upon
the
table
,
from
which
Mr
Jonas
filled
the
young
ladies
'
glasses
,
calling
on
them
not
to
spare
it
,
as
they
might
be
certain
there
was
plenty
more
where
that
came
from
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
added
with
some
haste
after
this
sally
that
it
was
only
his
joke
,
and
they
would
n't
suppose
him
to
be
in
earnest
<EOS>
,
he
was
sure
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
drink
,
"
said
Anthony
,
"
to
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
,
my
dears
.
 
<EOS>
A
clever
man
,
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
A
wary
man
!
 
<EOS>
A
hypocrite
,
though
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
A
hypocrite
,
girls
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
so
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
among
friends
,
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
the
worse
of
him
for
that
,
unless
it
is
that
he
overdoes
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
overdo
anything
,
my
darlings
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
overdo
even
hypocrisy
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
Jonas
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
overdo
taking
care
of
yourself
,
"
observed
that
hopeful
gentleman
with
his
mouth
full
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
that
,
my
dears
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Anthony
,
quite
enraptured
.
<EOS>
"
Wisdom
,
wisdom
!
 
<EOS>
A
good
exception
,
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
easy
to
overdo
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Except
,
"
whispered
Mr
Jonas
to
his
favourite
cousin
,
"
except
when
one
lives
too
long
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
the
other
one
that
---
I
say
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
me
!
"
said
Cherry
,
in
a
petulant
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
tell
her
yourself
,
if
you
wish
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
seems
to
make
such
game
of
one
,
"
replied
Mr
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
need
you
trouble
yourself
about
her
?
"
said
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
she
does
n't
trouble
herself
much
about
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
she
though
?
"
asked
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
me
,
need
I
tell
you
that
she
do
n't
?
"
returned
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
made
no
verbal
rejoinder
,
but
he
glanced
at
Mercy
with
an
odd
expression
in
his
face
;
and
said
THAT
would
n't
break
his
heart
,
she
might
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
looked
on
Charity
with
even
greater
favour
than
before
,
and
besought
her
,
as
his
polite
manner
was
,
to
"
come
a
little
closer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
another
thing
that
's
not
easily
overdone
,
father
,
"
remarked
Jonas
,
after
a
short
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
father
;
grinning
already
in
anticipation
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
bargain
,
"
said
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
rule
for
bargains
---
"
<EOS>
Do
other
men
,
for
they
would
do
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
true
business
precept
.
<EOS>
All
others
are
counterfeits
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
delighted
father
applauded
this
sentiment
to
the
echo
;
and
was
so
much
tickled
by
it
,
that
he
was
at
the
pains
of
imparting
the
same
to
his
ancient
clerk
,
who
rubbed
his
hands
,
nodded
his
palsied
head
,
winked
his
watery
eyes
,
and
cried
in
his
whistling
tones
,
"
<EOS>
Good
!
<EOS>
good
!
 
<EOS>
Your
own
son
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
"
with
every
feeble
demonstration
of
delight
that
he
was
capable
of
making
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
old
man
's
enthusiasm
had
the
redeeming
quality
of
being
felt
in
sympathy
with
the
only
creature
to
whom
he
was
linked
by
ties
of
long
association
,
and
by
his
present
helplessness
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
there
had
been
anybody
there
,
who
cared
to
think
about
it
,
some
dregs
of
a
better
nature
unawakened
,
might
perhaps
have
been
descried
through
that
very
medium
,
melancholy
though
it
was
,
yet
lingering
at
the
bottom
of
the
worn
-
out
cask
called
Chuffey
.
   
<EOS>
As
matters
stood
,
nobody
thought
or
said
anything
upon
the
subject
;
so
Chuffey
fell
back
into
a
dark
corner
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
,
where
he
always
spent
his
evenings
,
and
was
neither
seen
nor
heard
again
that
night
;
save
once
,
when
a
cup
of
tea
was
given
him
,
in
which
he
was
seen
to
soak
his
bread
mechanically
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
went
to
sleep
at
these
seasons
,
or
that
he
heard
,
or
saw
,
or
felt
,
or
thought
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
,
as
it
were
,
frozen
up
---
if
any
term
expressive
of
such
a
vigorous
process
can
be
applied
to
him
---
until
he
was
again
thawed
for
the
moment
by
a
word
or
touch
from
Anthony
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
made
tea
by
desire
of
Mr
Jonas
,
and
felt
and
looked
so
like
the
lady
of
the
house
that
she
was
in
the
prettiest
confusion
imaginable
;
the
more
so
from
Mr
Jonas
sitting
close
beside
her
,
and
whispering
a
variety
of
admiring
expressions
in
her
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mercy
,
for
her
part
,
felt
the
entertainment
of
the
evening
to
be
so
distinctly
and
exclusively
theirs
,
that
she
silently
deplored
the
commercial
gentlemen
---
at
that
moment
,
no
doubt
,
wearying
for
her
return
---
and
yawned
over
yesterday
's
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Anthony
,
he
went
to
sleep
outright
,
so
Jonas
and
Cherry
had
a
clear
stage
to
themselves
as
long
as
they
chose
to
keep
possession
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
tea
-
tray
was
taken
away
,
as
it
was
at
last
,
Mr
Jonas
produced
a
dirty
pack
of
cards
,
and
entertained
the
sisters
with
divers
small
feats
of
dexterity
:
whereof
the
main
purpose
of
every
one
was
,
that
you
were
to
decoy
somebody
into
laying
a
wager
with
you
that
you
could
n't
do
it
;
and
were
then
immediately
to
win
and
pocket
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
informed
them
that
these
accomplishments
were
in
high
vogue
in
the
most
intellectual
circles
,
and
that
large
amounts
were
constantly
changing
hands
on
such
hazards
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
may
be
remarked
that
he
fully
believed
this
;
for
there
is
a
simplicity
of
cunning
no
less
than
a
simplicity
of
innocence
;
and
in
all
matters
where
a
lively
faith
in
knavery
and
meanness
was
required
as
the
ground
-
work
of
belief
,
Mr
Jonas
was
one
of
the
most
credulous
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
His
ignorance
,
which
was
stupendous
,
may
be
taken
into
account
,
if
the
reader
pleases
,
separately
.
   
<EOS>
This
fine
young
man
had
all
the
inclination
to
be
a
profligate
of
the
first
water
,
and
only
lacked
the
one
good
trait
in
the
common
catalogue
of
debauched
vices
---
open
-
handedness
---
to
be
a
notable
vagabond
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
his
griping
and
penurious
habits
stepped
in
;
and
as
one
poison
will
sometimes
neutralise
another
,
when
wholesome
remedies
would
not
avail
,
so
he
was
restrained
by
a
bad
passion
from
quaffing
his
full
measure
of
evil
,
when
virtue
might
have
sought
to
hold
him
back
in
vain
.
   
<EOS>
By
the
time
he
had
unfolded
all
the
peddling
schemes
he
knew
upon
the
cards
,
it
was
growing
late
in
the
evening
;
and
Mr
Pecksniff
not
making
his
appearance
,
the
young
ladies
expressed
a
wish
to
return
home
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
,
Mr
Jonas
,
in
his
gallantry
,
would
by
no
means
allow
,
until
they
had
partaken
of
some
bread
and
cheese
and
porter
;
and
even
then
he
was
excessively
unwilling
to
allow
them
to
depart
;
often
beseeching
Miss
Charity
to
come
a
little
closer
,
or
to
stop
a
little
longer
,
and
preferring
many
other
complimentary
petitions
of
that
nature
in
his
own
hospitable
and
earnest
way
.
 
<EOS>
When
all
his
efforts
to
detain
them
were
fruitless
,
he
put
on
his
hat
and
greatcoat
preparatory
to
escorting
them
to
Todgers
's
;
remarking
that
he
knew
they
would
rather
walk
thither
than
ride
;
and
that
for
his
part
he
was
quite
of
their
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
night
,
"
said
Anthony
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
night
;
remember
me
to
---
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
---
to
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
of
your
cousin
,
my
dears
;
beware
of
Jonas
;
he
's
a
dangerous
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
quarrel
for
him
,
in
any
case
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
creature
!
"
cried
Mercy
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
idea
of
quarrelling
for
HIM
!
<EOS>
You
may
take
him
,
Cherry
,
my
love
,
all
to
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
you
a
present
of
my
share
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
sour
grape
,
am
I
,
cousin
?
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
was
more
entertained
by
this
repartee
than
one
would
have
supposed
likely
,
considering
its
advanced
age
and
simple
character
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
her
sisterly
affection
she
took
Mr
Jonas
to
task
for
leaning
so
very
hard
upon
a
broken
reed
,
and
said
that
he
must
not
be
so
cruel
to
poor
Merry
any
more
,
or
she
(
Charity
)
would
positively
be
obliged
to
hate
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mercy
,
who
really
had
her
share
of
good
humour
,
only
retorted
with
a
laugh
;
and
they
walked
home
in
consequence
without
any
angry
passages
of
words
upon
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
being
in
the
middle
,
and
having
a
cousin
on
each
arm
,
sometimes
squeezed
the
wrong
one
;
so
tightly
too
,
as
to
cause
her
not
a
little
inconvenience
;
but
as
he
talked
to
Charity
in
whispers
the
whole
time
,
and
paid
her
great
attention
,
no
doubt
this
was
an
accidental
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
at
Todgers
's
,
and
the
door
was
opened
,
Mercy
broke
hastily
from
them
,
and
ran
upstairs
;
but
Charity
and
Jonas
lingered
on
the
steps
talking
together
for
more
than
five
minutes
;
so
,
as
Mrs
Todgers
observed
next
morning
,
to
a
third
party
,
"
It
was
pretty
clear
what
was
going
on
THERE
,
and
she
was
glad
of
it
,
for
it
really
was
high
time
that
Miss
Pecksniff
thought
of
settling
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
now
the
day
was
coming
on
,
when
that
bright
vision
which
had
burst
on
Todgers
's
so
suddenly
,
and
made
a
sunshine
in
the
shady
breast
of
Jinkins
,
was
to
be
seen
no
more
;
when
it
was
to
be
packed
,
like
a
brown
paper
parcel
,
or
a
fish
-
basket
,
or
an
oyster
barrel
or
a
fat
gentleman
,
or
any
other
dull
reality
of
life
,
in
a
stagecoach
and
carried
down
into
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
my
dear
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
when
they
retired
to
rest
on
the
last
night
of
their
stay
,
"
never
have
I
seen
an
establishment
so
perfectly
broken
-
hearted
as
mine
is
at
this
present
moment
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
the
gentlemen
will
be
the
gentlemen
they
were
,
or
anything
like
it
---
no
,
not
for
weeks
to
come
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
great
deal
to
answer
for
,
both
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
modestly
disclaimed
any
wilful
agency
in
this
disastrous
state
of
things
,
and
regretted
it
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
pious
pa
,
too
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
loss
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
your
pa
is
a
perfect
missionary
of
peace
and
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
Entertaining
an
uncertainty
as
to
the
particular
kind
of
love
supposed
to
be
comprised
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
mission
,
the
young
ladies
received
the
compliment
rather
coldly
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
dared
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
perceiving
this
,
"
to
violate
a
confidence
which
has
been
reposed
in
me
,
and
to
tell
you
why
I
must
beg
of
you
to
leave
the
little
door
between
your
room
and
mine
open
tonight
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
would
be
interested
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
n't
do
it
,
for
I
promised
Mr
Jinkins
faithfully
,
that
I
would
be
as
silent
as
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mrs
Todgers
!
 
<EOS>
What
can
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
my
sweet
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
"
said
the
lady
of
the
house
;
"
my
own
loves
,
if
you
will
allow
me
the
privilege
of
taking
that
freedom
on
the
eve
of
our
separation
,
Mr
Jinkins
and
the
gentlemen
have
made
up
a
little
musical
party
among
themselves
,
and
DO
intend
,
in
the
dead
of
this
night
,
to
perform
a
serenade
upon
the
stairs
outside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wished
,
I
own
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
with
her
usual
foresight
,
"
that
it
had
been
fixed
to
take
place
an
hour
or
two
earlier
;
because
when
gentlemen
sit
up
late
they
drink
,
and
when
they
drink
they
're
not
so
musical
,
perhaps
,
as
when
they
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
the
arrangement
;
and
I
know
you
will
be
gratified
,
my
dear
Miss
Pecksniffs
,
by
such
a
mark
of
their
attention
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
were
at
first
so
much
excited
by
the
news
,
that
they
vowed
they
could
n't
think
of
going
to
bed
until
the
serenade
was
over
.
 
<EOS>
But
half
an
hour
of
cool
waiting
so
altered
their
opinion
that
they
not
only
went
to
bed
,
but
fell
asleep
;
and
were
,
moreover
,
not
ecstatically
charmed
to
be
awakened
some
time
afterwards
by
certain
dulcet
strains
breaking
in
upon
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
very
affecting
---
<EOS>
very
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
more
dismal
could
have
been
desired
by
the
most
fastidious
taste
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
of
a
vocal
turn
was
head
mute
,
or
chief
mourner
;
Jinkins
took
the
bass
;
and
the
rest
took
anything
they
could
get
.
 
<EOS>
The
youngest
gentleman
blew
his
melancholy
into
a
flute
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
blow
much
out
of
it
,
but
that
was
all
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
two
Miss
Pecksniffs
and
Mrs
Todgers
had
perished
by
spontaneous
combustion
,
and
the
serenade
had
been
in
honour
of
their
ashes
,
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
surpass
the
unutterable
despair
expressed
in
that
one
chorus
,
"
Go
where
glory
waits
thee
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
requiem
,
a
dirge
,
a
moan
,
a
howl
,
a
wail
,
a
lament
,
an
abstract
of
everything
that
is
sorrowful
and
hideous
in
sound
.
 
<EOS>
The
flute
of
the
youngest
gentleman
was
wild
and
fitful
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
and
went
in
gusts
,
like
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
together
he
seemed
to
have
left
off
,
and
when
it
was
quite
settled
by
Mrs
Todgers
and
the
young
ladies
that
,
overcome
by
his
feelings
,
he
had
retired
in
tears
,
he
unexpectedly
turned
up
again
at
the
very
top
of
the
tune
,
gasping
for
breath
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
tremendous
performer
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
knowing
where
to
have
him
;
and
exactly
when
you
thought
he
was
doing
nothing
at
all
,
then
was
he
doing
the
very
thing
that
ought
to
astonish
you
most
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
several
of
these
concerted
pieces
;
perhaps
two
or
three
too
many
,
though
that
,
as
Mrs
Todgers
said
,
was
a
fault
on
the
right
side
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
then
,
even
at
that
solemn
moment
,
when
the
thrilling
sounds
may
be
presumed
to
have
penetrated
into
the
very
depths
of
his
nature
,
if
he
had
any
depths
,
Jinkins
could
n't
leave
the
youngest
gentleman
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
him
distinctly
,
before
the
second
song
began
---
as
a
personal
favour
too
,
mark
the
villain
in
that
---
not
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
<EOS>
;
he
said
so
;
not
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
The
breathing
of
the
youngest
gentleman
was
heard
through
the
key
-
hole
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
DIDN'T
play
.
 
<EOS>
What
vent
was
a
flute
for
the
passions
swelling
up
within
his
breast
?
 
<EOS>
A
trombone
would
have
been
a
world
too
mild
.
   
<EOS>
The
serenade
approached
its
close
.
 
<EOS>
Its
crowning
interest
was
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
of
a
literary
turn
had
written
a
song
on
the
departure
of
the
ladies
,
and
adapted
it
to
an
old
tune
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
joined
,
except
the
youngest
gentleman
in
company
,
who
,
for
the
reasons
aforesaid
,
maintained
a
fearful
silence
.
 
<EOS>
The
song
(
which
was
of
a
classical
nature
)
invoked
the
oracle
of
Apollo
,
and
demanded
to
know
what
would
become
of
Todgers
's
when
CHARITY
and
MERCY
were
banished
from
its
walls
.
 
<EOS>
The
oracle
delivered
no
opinion
particularly
worth
remembering
,
according
to
the
not
infrequent
practice
of
oracles
from
the
earliest
ages
down
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
In
the
absence
of
enlightenment
on
that
subject
,
the
strain
deserted
it
,
and
went
on
to
show
that
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
were
nearly
related
to
Rule
Britannia
,
and
that
if
Great
Britain
had
n't
been
an
island
,
there
could
have
been
no
Miss
Pecksniffs
.
 
<EOS>
And
being
now
on
a
nautical
tack
,
it
closed
with
this
verse
:
    
"
All
hail
to
the
vessel
of
Pecksniff
the
sire
!
    
<EOS>
And
favouring
breezes
to
fan
;
     
While
Tritons
flock
round
it
,
and
proudly
admire
    
The
architect
,
artist
,
and
man
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
they
presented
this
beautiful
picture
to
the
imagination
,
the
gentlemen
gradually
withdrew
to
bed
to
give
the
music
the
effect
of
distance
;
and
so
it
died
away
,
and
Todgers
's
was
left
to
its
repose
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
reserved
his
vocal
offering
until
the
morning
,
when
he
put
his
head
into
the
room
as
the
young
ladies
were
kneeling
before
their
trunks
,
packing
up
,
and
treated
them
to
an
imitation
of
the
voice
of
a
young
dog
in
trying
circumstances
;
when
that
animal
is
supposed
by
persons
of
a
lively
fancy
,
to
relieve
his
feelings
by
calling
for
pen
and
ink
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
young
ladies
,
"
said
the
youth
,
"
<EOS>
so
you
're
a
-
going
home
,
are
you
,
worse
luck
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Bailey
,
we
're
going
home
,
"
returned
Mercy
.
   
<EOS>
"
An't
you
<EOS>
a
-
going
to
leave
none
of
'em
a
lock
of
your
hair
?
"
inquired
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
real
,
an't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
laughed
at
this
,
and
told
him
of
course
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
is
it
of
course
,
though
?
"
said
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
better
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
Hers
an't
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
see
it
hanging
up
once
,
on
that
nail
by
the
winder
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
have
gone
behind
her
at
dinner
-
time
and
pulled
it
;
and
she
never
<EOS>
know'd
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
young
ladies
,
I
'm
a
-
going
to
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
an't
<EOS>
a
-
going
to
stand
being
called
names
by
her
,
no
longer
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mercy
inquired
what
his
plans
for
the
future
might
be
;
in
reply
to
whom
Mr
Bailey
intimated
that
he
thought
of
going
either
into
top
-
boots
,
or
into
the
army
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Into
the
army
!
"
cried
the
young
ladies
,
with
a
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bailey
,
"
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
many
drummers
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
I
'm
acquainted
with
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
their
country
set
a
valley
on
'em
<EOS>
,
mind
you
!
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
shot
,
I
see
,
"
observed
Mercy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
cried
Mr
Bailey
,
"
<EOS>
wot
if
I
am
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
something
gamey
in
it
,
young
ladies
,
an't
there
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
be
hit
with
a
cannon
-
ball
than
a
rolling
-
pin
,
and
she
's
always
a
-
catching
up
something
of
that
sort
,
and
throwing
it
at
me
,
when
the
gentlemans
'
appetites
is
good
.
<EOS>
Wot
,
"
said
Mr
Bailey
,
stung
by
the
recollection
of
his
wrongs
,
"
wot
,
if
they
DO
consume
the
per
-
vishuns
.
 
<EOS>
It
an't
<EOS>
MY
fault
,
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
no
one
says
it
is
,
"
said
Mercy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
they
though
?
"
retorted
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
No
one
may
n't
say
it
is
!
<EOS>
but
some
one
knows
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
an't

going
to
have
every
rise
in
prices
wisited
on
me

<EOS>
I
an't
<EOS>
a

going
to
be
killed
because
the
markets
is
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
stop
.
 
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
"
added
Mr
Bailey
,
relenting
into
a
smile
,
"
<EOS>
wotever
you
mean
to
give
me
,
you
'd
better
give
me
all
at
once
,
becos
<EOS>
if
ever
you

I
sha

and
as
to
the
other
boy
,
HE
wo

nothing
,
I

"
   
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
,
on
behalf
of
Mr
Pecksniff
and
themselves
,
acted
on
this
thoughtful
advice
;
and
in
consideration
of
their
private
friendship
,
presented
Mr
Bailey
with
a
gratuity
so
liberal
that
he
could
hardly
do
enough
to
show
his
gratitude
;
which
found
but
an
imperfect
vent
,
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
,
in
divers
secret
slaps
upon
his
pocket
,
and
other
such
facetious
pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
confined
to
these
ebullitions
;
for
besides
crushing
a
bandbox
,
with
a
bonnet
in
it
,
he
seriously
damaged
Mr
Pecksniff
's
luggage
,
by
ardently
hauling
it
down
from
the
top
of
the
house
;
and
in
short
evinced
,
by
every
means
in
his
power
,
a
lively
sense
of
the
favours
he
had
received
from
that
gentleman
and
his
family
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
and
Mr
Jinkins
came
home
to
dinner
arm
-
in
-
arm
;
for
the
latter
gentleman
had
made
half
-
holiday
on
purpose
;
thus
gaining
an
immense
advantage
over
the
youngest
gentleman
and
the
rest
,
whose
time
,
as
it
perversely
chanced
,
was
all
bespoke
,
until
the
evening
.
<EOS>
The
bottle
of
wine
was
Mr
Pecksniff
's
treat
,
and
they
were
very
sociable
indeed
;
though
full
of
lamentations
on
the
necessity
of
parting
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
in
the
midst
of
their
enjoyment
,
old
Anthony
and
his
son
were
announced
;
much
to
the
surprise
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
greatly
to
the
discomfiture
of
Jinkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
to
say
<EOS>
good
-
bye
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
"
said
Anthony
,
in
a
low
voice
,
to
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
they
took
their
seats
apart
at
the
table
,
while
the
rest
conversed
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
the
use
of
a
division
between
you
and
me
?
 
<EOS>
We
are
the
two
halves
of
a
pair
of
scissors
,
when
apart
,
Pecksniff
;
but
together
we
are
something
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
"
Unanimity
,
my
good
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
is
always
delightful
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
for
there
are
some
people
I
would
rather
differ
from
than
agree
with
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
my
opinion
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
still
having
"
hypocrite
"
in
his
mind
,
only
replied
by
a
motion
of
his
head
,
which
was
something
between
an
affirmative
bow
,
and
a
negative
shake
.
   
<EOS>
"
Complimentary
,
"
said
Anthony
.
 
<EOS>
"
Complimentary
,
upon
my
word
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
involuntary
tribute
to
your
abilities
,
even
at
the
time
;
and
it
was
not
a
time
to
suggest
compliments
either
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
agreed
in
the
coach
,
you
know
,
that
we
quite
understood
each
other
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
quite
!
"
<EOS>
assented
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
a
manner
which
implied
that
he
himself
was
misunderstood
most
cruelly
,
but
would
not
complain
.
   
<EOS>
Anthony
glanced
at
his
son
as
he
sat
beside
Miss
Charity
,
and
then
at
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
then
at
his
son
again
,
very
many
times
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
that
Mr
Pecksniff
's
glances
took
a
similar
direction
;
but
when
he
became
aware
of
it
,
he
first
cast
down
his
eyes
,
and
then
closed
them
;
as
if
he
were
determined
that
the
old
man
should
read
nothing
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jonas
is
a
shrewd
lad
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
appears
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pecksniff
in
his
most
candid
manner
,
"
to
be
very
shrewd
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
careful
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
careful
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
returned
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
ye
!
"
said
Anthony
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
sweet
upon
you
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
my
good
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
his
eyes
still
closed
;
"
young
people
---
young
people
---
a
kind
of
cousins
,
too
---
no
more
sweetness
than
is
in
that

Why
,
there
is
very
little
sweetness
in
that
,
according
to
our
experience
,
"
returned
Anthony
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
there
a
trifle
more
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Impossible
to
say
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
impossible
!
 
<EOS>
You
surprise
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
know
that
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
last
;
I
mean
the
sweetness
,
not
the
surprise
;
and
it
may
die
off
.
 
<EOS>
Supposing
it
should
last
,
perhaps
(
you
having
feathered
your
nest
pretty
well
,
and
I
having
done
the
same
)
,
we
might
have
a
mutual
interest
in
the
matter
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
smiling
gently
,
was
about
to
speak
,
but
Anthony
stopped
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
quite
unnecessary
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
never
thought
of
this
for
a
moment
;
and
in
a
point
so
nearly
affecting
the
happiness
of
your
dear
child
,
you
could
n't
,
as
a
tender
father
,
express
an
opinion
;
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
quite
right
.
<EOS>
And
like
you
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
seems
to
me
,
my
dear
Pecksniff
,
"
added
Anthony
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sleeve
,
"
that
if
you
and
I
kept
up
the
joke
of
pretending
not
to
see
this
,
one
of
us
might
possibly
be
placed
in
a
position
of
disadvantage
;
and
as
I
am
very
unwilling
to
be
that
party
myself
,
you
will
excuse
my
taking
the
liberty
of
putting
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
thus
early
;
and
having
it
distinctly
understood
,
as
it
is
now
,
that
we
do
see
it
,
and
do
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
for
your
attention
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
now
upon
an
equal
footing
;
which
is
agreeable
to
us
both
,
I
am
sure
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
rose
as
he
spoke
;
and
giving
Mr
Pecksniff
a
nod
of
intelligence
,
moved
away
from
him
to
where
the
young
people
were
sitting
;
leaving
that
good
man
somewhat
puzzled
and
discomfited
by
such
very
plain
dealing
,
and
not
quite
free
from
a
sense
of
having
been
foiled
in
the
exercise
of
his
familiar
weapons
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
night
-
coach
had
a
punctual
character
,
and
it
was
time
to
join
it
at
the
office
;
which
was
so
near
at
hand
that
they
had
already
sent
their
luggage
and
arranged
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Thither
the
whole
party
repaired
,
therefore
,
after
no
more
delay
than
sufficed
for
the
equipment
of
the
Miss
Pecksniffs
and
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
They
found
the
coach
already
at
its
starting
-
place
,
and
the
horses
in
;
there
,
too
,
were
a
large
majority
of
the
commercial
gentlemen
,
including
the
youngest
,
who
was
visibly
agitated
,
and
in
a
state
of
deep
mental
dejection
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
could
equal
the
distress
of
Mrs
Todgers
in
parting
from
the
young
ladies
,
except
the
strong
emotions
with
which
she
bade
adieu
to
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Never
surely
was
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
taken
in
and
out
of
a
flat
reticule
so
often
as
Mrs
Todgers
's
was
,
as
she
stood
upon
the
pavement
by
the
coach
-
door
supported
on
either
side
by
a
commercial
gentleman
;
and
by
the
sight
of
the
coach
-
lamps
caught
such
brief
snatches
and
glimpses
of
the
good
man
's
face
,
as
the
constant
interposition
of
Mr
Jinkins
allowed
.
 
<EOS>
For
Jinkins
,
to
the
last
the
youngest
gentleman
's
rock
a
-
head
in
life
,
stood
upon
the
coachstep
talking
to
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
other
step
was
Mr
Jonas
,
who
maintained
that
position
in
right
of
his
cousinship
;
whereas
the
youngest
gentleman
,
who
had
been
first
upon
the
ground
,
was
deep
in
the
booking
-
office
among
the
black
and
red
placards
,
and
the
portraits
of
fast
coaches
,
where
he
was
ignominiously
harassed
by
porters
,
and
had
to
contend
and
strive
perpetually
with
heavy
baggage
.
 
<EOS>
This
false
position
,
combined
with
his
nervous
excitement
,
brought
about
the
very
consummation
and
catastrophe
of
his
miseries
;
for
when
in
the
moment
of
parting
he
aimed
a
flower
,
a
hothouse
flower
that
had
cost
money
,
at
the
fair
hand
of
Mercy
,
it
reached
,
instead
,
the
coachman
on
the
box
,
who
thanked
him
kindly
,
and
stuck
it
in
his
buttonhole
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
off
now
;
and
Todgers
's
was
alone
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
young
ladies
,
leaning
back
in
their
separate
corners
,
resigned
themselves
to
their
own
regretful
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pecksniff
,
dismissing
all
ephemeral
considerations
of
social
pleasure
and
enjoyment
,
concentrated
his
meditations
on
the
one
great
virtuous
purpose
before
him
,
of
casting
out
that
ingrate
and
deceiver
,
whose
presence
yet
troubled
his
domestic
hearth
,
and
was
a
sacrilege
upon
the
altars
of
his
household
gods
.

Will
be
seen
in

long
run

not
in
the
short
one

to
concern
Mr

and
others
,
nearly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
asserts
the
dignity
of
outraged
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Martin
Chuzzlewit
forms
a
desperate
resolution
 
Mr
Pinch
and
Martin
,
little
dreaming
of
the
stormy
weather
that
impended
,
made
themselves
very
comfortable
in
the
Pecksniffian
halls
,
and
improved
their
friendship
daily
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
's
facility
,
both
of
invention
and
execution
,
being
remarkable
<EOS>
,
the
grammar
-
school
proceeded
with
great
vigour
;
and
Tom
repeatedly
declared
,
that
if
there
were
anything
like
certainty
in
human
affairs
,
or
impartiality
in
human
judges
,
a
design
so
new
and
full
of
merit
could
not
fail
to
carry
off
the
first
prize
when
the
time
of
competition
arrived
.
<EOS>
Without
being
quite
so
sanguine
himself
,
Martin
had
his
hopeful
anticipations
too
;
and
they
served
to
make
him
brisk
and
eager
at
his
task
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
should
turn
out
a
great
architect
,
Tom
,
"
said
the
new
pupil
one
day
,
as
he
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
his
drawing
,
and
eyed
it
with
much
complacency
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
should
be
one
of
the
things
I
'd
build
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Tom
Pinch
,
quite
as
much
delighted
as
if
the
thing
were
done
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
though
?
 
<EOS>
How
kind
of
you
to
say
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
build
it
up
,
Tom
,
"
returned
Martin
,
"
on
such
a
strong
foundation
,
that
it
should
last
your
life
---
aye
,
and
your
children
's
lives
too
,
and
their
children
's
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
be
your
patron
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
take
you
under
my
protection
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
the
man
who
should
give
the
cold
shoulder
to
anybody
I
chose
to
protect
and
patronise
,
if
I
were
at
the
top
of
the
tree
,
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
do
n't
think
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
"
upon
my
word
,
that
I
was
ever
more
gratified
than
by
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
mean
what
I
say
,
"
retorted
Martin
,
with
a
manner
as
free
and
easy
in
its
condescension
<EOS>
to
,
not
to
say
in
its
compassion
for
,
the
other
,
as
if
he
were
already
First
Architect
in
ordinary
to
all
the
Crowned
Heads
in
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
provide
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Tom
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
that
I
should
be
a
mighty
awkward
person
to
provide
for
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
!
"
rejoined
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
that
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
took
it
in
my
head
to
say
,
"
Pinch
is
a
clever
fellow
;
I
approve
of
Pinch
;
"
I
should
like
to
know
the
man
who
would
venture
to
put
himself
in
opposition
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
confound
it
,
Tom
,
you
could
be
useful
to
me
in
a
hundred
ways
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
not
useful
in
one
or
two
,
it
should
n't
be
for
want
of
trying
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
instance
,
"
pursued
Martin
,
after
a
short
reflection
,
"
you
'd
be
a
capital
fellow
,
now
,
to
see
that
my
ideas
were
properly
carried
out
;
and
to
overlook
the
works
in
their
progress
before
they
were
sufficiently
advanced
to
be
very
interesting
to
ME
;
and
to
take
all
that
sort
of
plain
sailing
.
 
<EOS>
Then
you
'd
be
a
splendid
fellow
to
show
people
over
my
studio
,
and
to
talk
about
Art
to
'em
,
when
I
could
n't
be
bored
myself
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
would
be
devilish
creditable
,
<EOS>
Tom
(
I
'm
quite
in
earnest
,
I
give
you
my
word
)
,
to
have
a
man
of
your
information
about
one
,
instead
of
some
ordinary
blockhead
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
'd
take
care
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
be
useful
,
rely
upon
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
say
that
Tom
had
no
idea
of
playing
first
fiddle
in
any
social
orchestra
,
but
was
always
quite
satisfied
to
be
set
down
for
the
hundred
and
fiftieth
violin
in
the
band
,
or
thereabouts
,
is
to
express
his
modesty
in
very
inadequate
terms
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
much
delighted
,
therefore
,
by
these
observations
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
married
to
her
then
,
Tom
,
of
course
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
What
was
that
which
checked
Tom
Pinch
so
suddenly
,
in
the
high
flow
of
his
gladness
;
bringing
the
blood
into
his
honest
cheeks
,
and
a
remorseful
feeling
to
his
honest
heart
,
as
if
he
were
unworthy
of
his
friend
's
regard
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
married
to
her
then
,
"
said
Martin
,
looking
with
a
smile
towards
the
light
;
"
and
we
should
have
,
I
hope
,
children
about
us
.
<EOS>
They
'd
be
very
fond
of
you
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
not
a
word
said
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
The
words
he
would
have
uttered
died
upon
his
lips
,
and
found
a
life
more
spiritual
in
self
-
denying
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
the
children
hereabouts
are
fond
of
you
,
Tom
,
and
mine
would
be
,
of
course
,
"
pursued
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
might
name
one
of
'em
after
you
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
's
not
a
bad
name
.
<EOS>
Thomas
Pinch
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
T*P*C
on
his
pinafores
---
no
objection
to
that
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
cleared
his
throat
,
and
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
SHE
would
like
you
,
Tom
,
I
know
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
cried
Tom
Pinch
,
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
exactly
what
she
would
think
of
you
,
"
said
Martin
leaning
his
chin
upon
his
hand
,
and
looking
through
the
window
-
glass
as
if
he
read
there
what
he
said
;
"
I
know
her
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
smile
,
Tom
,
often
at
first
when
you
spoke
to
her
,
or
when
she
looked
at
you
---
merrily
too
---
but
you
would
n't
mind
that
.
 
<EOS>
A
brighter
smile
you
never
saw
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
mind
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
would
be
as
tender
with
you
,
Tom
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
as
if
you
were
a
child
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
are
almost
,
in
some
things
,
<EOS>
an't
you
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
nodded
his
entire
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
would
always
be
kind
and
good
-
humoured
,
and
glad
to
see
you
,
"
said
Martin
;
"
and
when
she
found
out
exactly
what
sort
of
fellow
<EOS>
you
were
(
which
she
'd
do
very
soon
)
,
she
would
pretend
to
give
you
little
commissions
to
execute
,
and
to
ask
little
services
of
you
,
which
she
knew
you
were
burning
to
render
;
so
that
when
she
really
pleased
you
most
,
she
would
try
to
make
you
think
you
most
pleased
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
take
to
you
uncommonly
,
Tom
;
and
would
understand
you
far
more
delicately
than
I
ever
shall
;
and
would
often
say
,
I
know
,
that
you
were
a
harmless
,
gentle
,
well
-
intentioned
,
good
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
How
silent
Tom
Pinch
was
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
honour
of
old
time
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
and
of
her
having
heard
you
play
the
organ
in
this
damp
little
church
down
here
---
for
nothing
too
<EOS>
---
we
will
have
one
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
build
an
architectural
music
-
room
on
a
plan
of
my
own
,
and
it
'll
look
rather
knowing
in
a
recess
at
one
end
.
 
<EOS>
There
you
shall
play
away
,
Tom
,
till
you
tire
yourself
;
and
,
as
you
like
to
do
so
in
the
dark
,
it
shall
BE
dark
;
and
many
's
the
summer
evening
<EOS>
she
and
I
will
sit
and
listen
to
you
,
Tom
;
be
sure
of
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
may
have
required
a
stronger
effort
on
Tom
Pinch
's
part
to
leave
the
seat
on
which
he
sat
,
and
shake
his
friend
by
both
hands
,
with
nothing
but
serenity
and
grateful
feeling
painted
on
his
face
;
it
may
have
required
a
stronger
effort
to
perform
this
simple
act
with
a
pure
heart
,
than
to
achieve
many
and
many
a
deed
to
which
the
doubtful
trumpet
blown
by
Fame
has
lustily
resounded
.
 
<EOS>
Doubtful
,
because
from
its
long
hovering
over
scenes
of
violence
,
the
smoke
and
steam
of
death
have
clogged
the
keys
of
that
brave
instrument
;
and
it
is
not
always
that
its
notes
are
either
true
or
tuneful
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
proof
of
the
kindness
of
human
nature
,
"
said
Tom
,
characteristically
putting
himself
quite
out
of
sight
in
the
matter
,
"
that
everybody
who
comes
here
,
as
you
have
done
,
is
more
considerate
and
affectionate
to
me
than
I
should
have
any
right
to
hope
,
if
I
were
the
most
sanguine
creature
in
the
world
;
or
should
have
any
power
to
express
,
if
I
were
the
most
eloquent
.
 
<EOS>
It
really
overpowers
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
trust
me
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
that
I
am
not
ungrateful
---
 
<EOS>
that
I
never
forget
---
and
that
if
I
can
ever
prove
the
truth
of
my
words
to
you
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
right
,
"
observed
Martin
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
a
hand
in
each
pocket
,
and
yawning
drearily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
fine
talking
,
Tom
;
but
I
'm
at
Pecksniff
's
,
I
remember
,
and
perhaps
a
mile
or
so
out
of
the
high
-
road
to
fortune
just
at
this
minute
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
've
heard
again
this
morning
from
what
's
his
name
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
may
that
be
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Tom
,
seeming
to
enter
a
mild
protest
on
behalf
of
the
dignity
of
an
absent
person
.
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
know
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Northkey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Westlock
,
"
rejoined
Tom
,
in
rather
a
louder
tone
than
usual
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
was
something
connected
with
a
point
of
the
compass
and
a
door
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
and
what
says
Westlock
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
has
come
into
his
property
,
"
answered
Tom
,
nodding
his
head
,
and
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
lucky
dog
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
were
mine
instead
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
all
the
mystery
you
were
to
tell
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
not
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
rest
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
matter
of
that
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
it
's
no
mystery
,
and
you
wo
n't
think
much
of
it
;
but
it
's
very
pleasant
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
John
always
used
to
say
when
he
was
here
,
"
Mark
my
words
,
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
When
my
father
's
executors
cash
up
"
---
he
used
strange
expressions
now
and
then
,
but
that
was
his
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cash
-
up
's
a
very
good
expression
,
"
observed
Martin
,
"
when
other
people
do
n't
apply
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
---
What
a
slow
fellow
you
are
,
Pinch
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
am
<EOS>
I
know
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
but
you
'll
make
me
nervous
if
you
tell
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
you
have
put
me
out
a
little
now
,
<EOS>
for
I
forget
what
I
was
going
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
John
's
father
's
executors
cashed
up
,
"
said
Martin
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
to
be
sure
,
"
cried
Tom
;
"
yes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
says
John
,
"
I
'll
give
you
a
dinner
,
Pinch
,
and
come
down
to
Salisbury
on
purpose
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
when
John
wrote
the
other
day
---
the
morning
Pecksniff
left
,
you
know
---
he
said
his
business
was
on
the
point
of
being
immediately
settled
,
and
as
he
was
to
receive
his
money
directly
,
when
could
I
meet
him
at
Salisbury
?
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
and
said
,
any
day
this
week
;
<EOS>
and
I
told
him
besides
,
that
there
was
a
new
pupil
here
,
and
what
a
fine
fellow
you
were
,
and
what
friends
we
had
become
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
John
writes
back
this
letter
"
---
<EOS>
Tom
produced
it
---
"
fixes
to
-
morrow
;
sends
his
compliments
to
you
;
and
begs
that
we
three
may
have
the
pleasure
of
dining
together
;
not
at
the
house
where
you
and
I
were
,
either
;
but
at
the
very
first
hotel
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
Read
what
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Martin
,
glancing
over
it
with
his
customary
coolness
;
"
much
obliged
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
agreeable
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
could
have
wished
him
to
be
a
little
more
astonished
,
a
little
more
pleased
,
or
in
some
form
or
other
a
little
more
interested
in
such
a
great
event
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
perfectly
self
-
possessed
;
and
falling
into
his
favourite
solace
of
whistling
,
took
another
turn
at
the
grammar
-
school
,
as
if
nothing
at
all
had
happened
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
's
horse
being
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
sacred
animal
,
only
to
be
driven
by
him
,
the
chief
priest
of
that
temple
,
or
by
some
person
distinctly
nominated
for
the
time
being
to
that
high
office
by
himself
,
the
two
young
men
agreed
to
walk
to
Salisbury
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
when
the
time
came
,
they
set
off
on
foot
;
which
was
,
after
all
,
a
better
mode
of
travelling
than
in
the
gig
,
as
the
weather
was
very
cold
and
very
dry
.
   
<EOS>
Better
!
 
<EOS>
A
rare
strong
,
hearty
,
healthy
walk
---
four
statute
miles
an
hour
---
preferable
to
that
rumbling
,
tumbling
,
jolting
,
shaking
,
scraping
,
creaking
,
villanous
old
gig
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
two
things
will
not
admit
of
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
insult
to
the
walk
,
to
set
them
side
by
side
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
an
instance
of
a
gig
having
ever
circulated
a
man
's
blood
,
unless
when
,
putting
him
in
danger
of
his
neck
,
it
awakened
in
his
veins
and
in
his
ears
,
and
all
along
his
spine
,
a
tingling
heat
,
much
more
peculiar
than
agreeable
?
 
<EOS>
When
did
a
gig
ever
sharpen
anybody
's
wits
and
energies
,
unless
it
was
when
the
horse
bolted
,
and
,
crashing
madly
down
a
steep
hill
with
a
stone
wall
at
the
bottom
,
his
desperate
circumstances
suggested
to
the
only
gentleman
left
inside
,
some
novel
and
unheard
-
of
mode
of
dropping
out
behind
?
 
<EOS>
Better
than
the
gig
!
   
<EOS>
The
air
was
cold
,
Tom
;
so
it
was
,
<EOS>
there
was
no
denying
it
;
but
would
it
have
been
more
genial
in
the
gig
?
 
<EOS>
The
blacksmith
's
fire
burned
very
bright
,
and
leaped
up
high
,
as
though
it
wanted
men
to
warm
;
but
would
it
have
been
less
tempting
,
looked
at
from
the
clammy
cushions
of
a
gig
?
 
<EOS>
The
wind
blew
keenly
,
nipping
the
features
of
the
hardy
wight
who
fought
his
way
along
;
blinding
him
with
his
own
hair
if
he
had
enough
to
it
,
and
wintry
dust
if
he
had
n't
;
stopping
his
breath
as
though
he
had
been
soused
in
a
cold
bath
;
tearing
aside
his
wrappings
-
up
,
and
whistling
in
the
very
marrow
of
his
bones
;
but
it
would
have
done
all
this
a
hundred
times
more
fiercely
to
a
man
in
a
gig
,
would
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
A
fig
for
gigs
!
   
<EOS>
Better
than
the
gig
!
 
<EOS>
When
were
travellers
by
wheels
and
hoofs
seen
with
such
red
-
hot
cheeks
as
those
?
<EOS>
when
were
they
so
good
-
humouredly
and
merrily
bloused
?
<EOS>
when
did
their
laughter
ring
upon
the
air
,
as
they
turned
them
round
,
what
time
the
stronger
gusts
came
sweeping
up
;
and
,
facing
round
again
as
they
passed
by
,
dashed
on
,
in
such
a
glow
of
ruddy
health
as
nothing
could
keep
pace
with
,
but
the
high
spirits
it
engendered
?
 
<EOS>
Better
than
the
gig
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
here
is
a
man
in
a
gig
coming
the
same
way
now
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
him
as
he
passes
his
whip
into
his
left
hand
,
chafes
his
numbed
right
fingers
on
his
granite
leg
,
and
beats
those
marble
toes
of
his
upon
the
foot
-
board
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Who
would
exchange
this
rapid
hurry
of
the
blood
for
yonder
stagnant
misery
,
though
its
pace
were
twenty
miles
for
one
?
   
<EOS>
Better
than
the
gig
!
 
<EOS>
No
man
in
a
gig
could
have
such
interest
in
the
milestones
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
in
a
gig
could
see
,
or
feel
,
or
think
,
like
merry
users
of
their
legs
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
as
the
wind
sweeps
on
,
upon
these
breezy
downs
,
it
tracks
its
flight
in
darkening
ripples
on
the
grass
,
and
smoothest
shadows
on
the
hills
!
 
<EOS>
Look
round
and
round
upon
this
bare
bleak
plain
,
and
see
even
here
,
upon
a
winter
's
day
,
how
beautiful
the
shadows
are
!
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
it
is
the
nature
of
their
kind
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
loveliest
things
in
life
,
Tom
,
are
but
shadows
;
and
they
come
and
go
,
and
change
and
fade
away
,
as
rapidly
as
these
!
   
<EOS>
Another
mile
,
and
then
begins
a
fall
of
snow
,
making
the
crow
,
who
skims
away
so
close
above
the
ground
to
shirk
the
wind
,
a
blot
of
ink
upon
the
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
it
drives
and
drifts
against
them
as
they
walk
,
stiffening
on
their
skirts
,
and
freezing
in
the
lashes
of
their
eyes
,
they
would
n't
have
it
fall
more
sparingly
,
no
,
not
so
much
as
by
a
single
flake
,
although
they
had
to
go
a
score
of
miles
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
lo
!
<EOS>
the
towers
of
the
Old
Cathedral
rise
before
them
,
even
now
!
<EOS>
and
by
-
and
-
bye
they
come
into
the
sheltered
streets
,
made
strangely
silent
by
their
white
carpet
;
and
so
to
the
Inn
for
which
they
are
bound
;
<EOS>
where
they
present
such
flushed
and
burning
faces
to
the
cold
waiter
,
and
are
so
brimful
of
vigour
,
that
he
almost
feels
assaulted
by
their
presence
;
and
,
having
nothing
to
oppose
to
the
attack
(
being
fresh
,
or
rather
stale
,
from
the
blazing
fire
in
the
coffee
-
room
)
,
is
quite
put
out
of
his
pale
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
A
famous
Inn
!
<EOS>
the
hall
a
very
grove
of
dead
game
,
and
dangling
joints
of
mutton
;
and
in
one
corner
an
illustrious
larder
,
with
glass
doors
,
developing
cold
fowls
and
noble
joints
,
and
tarts
<EOS>
wherein
the
raspberry
jam
coyly
withdrew
itself
,
as
such
a
precious
creature
<EOS>
should
,
behind
a
lattice
work
of
pastry
.
 
<EOS>
And
behold
,
on
the
first
floor
,
at
the
court
-
end
of
the
house
,
in
a
room
with
all
the
window
-
curtains
drawn
,
a
fire
piled
half
-
way
up
the
chimney
,
plates
warming
before
it
,
wax
candles
gleaming
everywhere
,
and
a
table
spread
for
three
,
with
silver
and
glass
enough
for
thirty
---
 
John
Westlock
;
not
the
old
John
of
Pecksniff
's
,
but
a
proper
gentleman
;
looking
another
and
a
grander
person
,
with
the
consciousness
of
being
his
own
master
and
having
money
in
the
bank
;
and
yet
in
some
respects
the
old
John
too
,
for
he
seized
Tom
Pinch
by
both
his
hands
the
instant
he
appeared
,
and
fairly
hugged
him
,
in
his
cordial
welcome
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
this
,
"
said
John
,
"
is
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
to
see
him
!
"
<EOS>
---
John
had
an
off
-
hand
manner
of
his
own
;
so
they
shook
hands
warmly
,
and
were
friends
in
no
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stand
off
a
moment
,
Tom
,
"
cried
the
old
pupil
,
laying
one
hand
on
each
of
Mr
Pinch
's
shoulders
,
and
holding
him
out
at
arm
's
length
.
"
<EOS>
Let
me
look
at
you
!
 
<EOS>
Just
the
same
!
 
<EOS>
Not
a
bit
changed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
not
so
very
long
ago
,
you
know
,
"
said
Tom
Pinch
,
"
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
seems
an
age
to
me
,
"
cried
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
it
ought
to
seem
to
you
,
you
dog
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
pushed
Tom
down
into
the
easiest
chair
,
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
so
heartily
,
and
so
like
his
old
self
in
their
old
bedroom
at
old
Pecksniff
's
that
it
was
a
toss
-
up
with
Tom
Pinch
whether
he
should
laugh
or
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Laughter
won
it
;
and
they
all
three
laughed
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
ordered
everything
for
dinner
,
that
we
used
to
say
we
'd
have
,
Tom
,
"
observed
John
Westlock
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Tom
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Everything
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
laugh
,
if
you
can
help
it
,
before
the
waiters
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
when
I
was
ordering
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
like
a
dream
.
"
   
<EOS>
John
was
wrong
there
,
because
nobody
ever
dreamed
such
soup
as
was
put
upon
the
table
directly
afterwards
;
or
such
fish
;
or
such
side
-
dishes
;
or
such
a
top
and
bottom
;
or
such
a
course
of
birds
and
sweets
;
or
in
short
anything
approaching
the
reality
of
that
entertainment
at
ten
-
and
-
sixpence
a
head
,
exclusive
of
wines
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
THEM
,
the
man
who
can
dream
such
iced
champagne
,
such
claret
,
port
,
or
sherry
,
had
better
go
to
bed
and
stop
there
.
   
<EOS>
But
perhaps
the
finest
feature
of
the
banquet
was
,
that
nobody
was
half
so
much
amazed
by
everything
as
John
himself
,
who
in
his
high
delight
was
constantly
bursting
into
fits
of
laughter
,
and
then
endeavouring
to
appear
preternaturally
solemn
,
lest
the
waiters
should
conceive
he
was
n't
used
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
things
they
brought
him
to
carve
,
were
such
outrageous
practical
jokes
,
though
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
stand
it
;
and
when
Tom
Pinch
insisted
,
in
spite
of
the
deferential
advice
of
an
attendant
,
not
only
on
breaking
down
the
outer
wall
of
a
raised
pie
with
a
tablespoon
,
but
on
trying
to
eat
it
afterwards
,
John
lost
all
dignity
,
and
sat
behind
the
gorgeous
dish
-
cover
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
roaring
to
that
extent
that
he
was
audible
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
had
he
the
least
objection
to
laugh
at
himself
,
as
he
demonstrated
when
they
had
all
three
gathered
round
the
fire
and
the
dessert
was
on
the
table
;
at
which
period
the
head
waiter
inquired
with
respectful
solicitude
whether
that
port
,
being
a
light
and
tawny
wine
,
<EOS>
was
suited
to
his
taste
,
or
whether
he
would
wish
to
try
a
fruity
port
with
greater
body
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
John
gravely
answered
that
he
was
well
satisfied
with
what
he
had
,
which
he
esteemed
,
as
one
might
say
,
a
pretty
tidy
vintage
;
for
which
the
waiter
thanked
him
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
And
then
John
told
his
friends
,
with
a
broad
grin
,
that
he
supposed
it
was
all
right
,
but
he
did
n't
know
;
and
went
off
into
a
perfect
shout
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
very
merry
and
full
of
enjoyment
the
whole
time
,
but
not
the
least
pleasant
part
of
the
festival
was
when
they
all
three
sat
about
the
fire
,
cracking
nuts
,
drinking
wine
and
talking
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
It
happened
that
Tom
Pinch
had
a
word
to
say
to
his
friend
the
organist
's
assistant
,
and
so
deserted
his
warm
corner
for
a
few
minutes
at
this
season
,
lest
it
should
grow
too
late
;
leaving
the
other
two
young
men
together
.
   
<EOS>
They
drank
his
health
in
his
absence
,
of
course
;
and
John
Westlock
took
that
opportunity
of
saying
,
that
he
had
never
had
even
a
peevish
word
with
Tom
during
the
whole
term
of
their
residence
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
This
naturally
led
him
to
dwell
upon
Tom
's
character
,
and
to
hint
that
Mr
Pecksniff
understood
it
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
He
only
hinted
this
,
and
very
distantly
;
knowing
that
it
pained
Tom
Pinch
to
have
that
gentleman
disparaged
,
and
thinking
it
would
be
as
well
to
leave
the
new
pupil
to
his
own
discoveries
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
impossible
to
like
Pinch
better
than
I
do
,
or
to
do
greater
justice
to
his
good
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
most
willing
fellow
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
rather
too
willing
,
"
observed
John
,
who
was
quick
in
observation
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
a
fault
in
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
true
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fellow
only
a
week
or
so
ago
---
a
Mr
Tigg
---
who
borrowed
all
the
money
he
had
,
on
a
promise
to
repay
it
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
half
a
sovereign
,
to
be
sure
;
but
it
's
well
<EOS>
it
was
no
more
,
for
he
'll
never
see
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
said
John
,
who
had
been
very
attentive
to
these
few
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
have
not
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
that
,
in
his
own
pecuniary
transactions
,
Tom
's
proud
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
n't
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
he
borrow
?
"
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
odd
,
"
said
Martin
,
setting
down
his
empty
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
strange
compound
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
to
receiving
money
as
a
gift
,
"
resumed
John
Westlock
;
"
I
think
he
'd
die
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
made
up
of
simplicity
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
,
however
,
"
pursued
John
,
filling
his
own
glass
,
and
looking
at
his
companion
with
some
curiosity
,
"
who
are
older
than
the
majority
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
assistants
,
and
have
evidently
had
much
more
experience
,
understand
him
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
and
see
how
liable
he
is
to
be
imposed
upon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Martin
,
stretching
out
his
legs
,
and
holding
his
wine
between
his
eye
and
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pecksniff
knows
that
too
.
<EOS>
So
do
his
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
John
Westlock
smiled
,
but
made
no
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
that
reminds
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
opinion
of
Pecksniff
?
 
<EOS>
How
did
he
use
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
him
now
?
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
Coolly
,
you
know
,
when
it
's
all
over
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
Pinch
,
"
returned
the
old
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
knows
what
my
sentiments
used
to
be
upon
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
changed
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
I
'd
rather
have
them
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
Pinch
says
they
are
unjust
,
"
urged
John
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
Then
I
know
what
course
they
take
beforehand
,
"
said
Martin
;
"
<EOS>
and
,
therefore
,
you
can
have
no
delicacy
in
speaking
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
me
,
I
beg
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
him
<EOS>
I
tell
you
frankly
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
with
him
because
it
happens
from
particular
circumstances
to
suit
my
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
some
ability
,
I
believe
,
in
that
way
;
and
the
obligation
,
if
any
,
will
most
likely
be
on
his
side
and
not
mine
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
lowest
mark
,
the
balance
will
be
even
,
and
there
'll
be
no
obligation
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
may
talk
to
me
,
as
if
I
had
no
connection
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
press
me
to
give
my
opinion
---
"
returned
John
Westlock
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
oblige
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
I
should
say
,
"
resumed
the
other
,
"
that
he
is
the
most
consummate
scoundrel
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Martin
,
as
coolly
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
rather
strong
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
stronger
than
he
deserves
,
"
said
John
;
"
and
if
he
called
upon
me
to
express
my
opinion
of
him
to
his
face
,
I
would
do
so
in
the
very
same
terms
,
without
the
least
qualification
.
 
<EOS>
His
treatment
of
Pinch
is
in
itself
enough
to
justify
them
;
but
when
I
look
back
upon
the
five
years
I
passed
in
that
house
,
and
remember
the
hyprocrisy
,
the
knavery
,
the
meannesses
,
the
false
pretences
,
the
lip
service
of
that
fellow
,
and
his
trading
in
saintly
semblances
for
the
very
worst
realities
;
when
I
remember
how
often
I
was
the
witness
of
all
this
and
how
often
I
was
made
a
kind
of
party
to
it
,
by
the
fact
of
being
there
,
with
him
for
my
teacher
;
I
swear
to
you
that
I
almost
despise
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
drained
his
glass
,
and
looked
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
is
a
right
feeling
,
"
pursued
John
Westlock
"
because
it
was
no
fault
of
mine
;
and
I
can
quite
understand
---
you
for
instance
,
fully
appreciating
him
,
and
yet
being
forced
by
circumstances
to
remain
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
simply
what
my
feeling
is
;
and
even
now
,
when
,
as
you
say
,
it
's
all
over
;
and
when
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
always
hated
me
,
and
we
always
quarrelled
,
and
I
always
told
him
my
mind
;
even
now
,
I
feel
sorry
that
I
did
n't
yield
to
an
impulse
I
often
had
,
as
a
boy
,
of
running
away
from
him
and
going
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
abroad
?
"
asked
Martin
,
turning
his
eyes
upon
the
speaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
search
,
"
replied
John
Westlock
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
"
of
the
livelihood
I
could
n't
have
earned
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
something
spirited
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
come
!
 
<EOS>
Fill
your
glass
,
and
let
us
forget
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
you
please
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
reference
to
myself
and
my
connection
with
him
,
I
have
only
to
repeat
what
I
said
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
my
own
way
with
him
so
far
,
and
shall
continue
to
do
so
,
even
more
than
ever
;
for
the
fact
is
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
that
I
believe
he
looks
to
me
to
supply
his
defects
,
and
could
n't
afford
to
lose
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
notion
of
that
in
first
going
there
.
 
<EOS>
Your
health
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
returned
young
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yours
.
 
<EOS>
And
may
the
new
pupil
turn
out
as
well
as
you
can
desire
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
new
pupil
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fortunate
youth
,
born
under
an
auspicious
star
,
"
returned
John
Westlock
,
laughing
;
"
whose
parents
,
or
guardians
,
are
destined
to
be
hooked
by
the
advertisement
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
that
he
has
advertised
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
it
just
before
dinner
in
the
old
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
to
be
his
;
having
some
reason
to
remember
the
style
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
Here
's
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
,
is
it
not
,
that
the
more
he
likes
Pecksniff
(
if
he
can
like
him
better
than
he
does
)
,
the
greater
reason
one
has
to
like
HIM
?
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
more
,
or
we
shall
spoil
his
whole
enjoyment
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
entered
as
the
words
were
spoken
,
with
a
radiant
smile
upon
his
face
;
and
rubbing
his
hands
,
more
from
a
sense
of
delight
than
because
he
was
cold
(
for
he
had
been
running
fast
)
,
sat
down
in
his
warm
corner
again
,
and
was
as
happy
as
only
Tom
Pinch
could
be
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
other
simile
that
will
express
his
state
of
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
"
he
said
,
when
he
had
gazed
at
his
friend
for
some
time
in
silent
pleasure
,
"
so
you
really
are
a
gentleman
at
last
,
John
.
<EOS>
Well
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Trying
to
be
,
Tom
;
trying
to
be
,
"
he
rejoined
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
saying
what
I
may
turn
out
,
in
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
would
n't
carry
your
own
box
to
the
mail
now
?
"
said
Tom
Pinch
,
smiling
;
"
although
you
lost
it
altogether
by
not
taking
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
I
?
"
retorted
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
you
know
about
it
,
Pinch
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
a
very
heavy
box
that
I
would
n't
carry
to
get
away
from
Pecksniff
's
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
cried
Pinch
,
turning
to
Martin
,
"
I
told
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
fault
in
his
character
is
his
injustice
to
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
n't
mind
a
word
he
says
on
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
His
prejudice
is
most
extraordinary
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
absence
of
anything
like
prejudice
on
Tom
's
part
,
you
know
,
"
said
John
Westlock
,
laughing
heartily
,
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
Mr
Pinch
's
shoulder
,
"
is
perfectly
wonderful
.
 
<EOS>
If
one
man
ever
had
a
profound
knowledge
of
another
,
and
saw
him
in
a
true
light
,
and
in
his
own
proper
colours
,
Tom
has
that
knowledge
of
Mr
Pecksniff
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
I
have
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
exactly
what
I
have
so
often
said
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
knew
him
as
well
as
I
do
---
John
,
I
'd
give
almost
any
money
to
bring
that
about
---
you
'd
admire
,
respect
,
and
reverence
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
you
wounded
his
feelings
when
you
went
away
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
known
whereabout
his
feelings
lay
,
"
retorted
young
Westlock
,
"
I
'd
have
done
my
best
,
<EOS>
Tom
,
with
that
end
in
view
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
I
could
n't
wound
him
in
what
he
has
not
,
and
in
what
he
knows
nothing
of
,
except
in
his
ability
to
probe
them
to
the
quick
in
other
people
,
I
am
afraid
I
can
lay
no
claim
to
your
compliment
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
being
unwilling
to
protract
a
discussion
which
might
possibly
corrupt
Martin
,
forbore
to
say
anything
in
reply
to
this
speech
;
but
John
Westlock
,
whom
nothing
short
of
an
iron
gag
would
have
silenced
when
Mr
Pecksniff
's
merits
were
once
in
question
,
continued
notwithstanding
.
   
<EOS>
"
HIS
feelings
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
's
a
tender
-
hearted
man
.
 
<EOS>
HIS
feelings
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
's
a
considerate
,
conscientious
,
self
-
examining
,
moral
vagabond
,
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
HIS
feelings
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
---
what
's
the
matter
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
was
by
this
time
erect
upon
the
hearth
-
rug
,
buttoning
his
coat
with
great
energy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
bear
it
,
"
said
Tom
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
I
really
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
excuse
me
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
esteem
and
friendship
for
you
;
I
love
you
very
much
;
and
have
been
perfectly
charmed
and
overjoyed
to
-
day
,
to
find
you
just
the
same
as
ever
;
but
I
can
not
listen
to
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
my
old
way
,
Tom
;
and
you
say
yourself
that
you
are
glad
to
find
me
unchanged
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
in
this
respect
,
"
said
Tom
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
excuse
me
,
John
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
really
;
I
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
wrong
;
you
should
be
more
guarded
in
your
expressions
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
bad
enough
when
you
and
I
used
to
be
alone
together
,
but
under
existing
circumstances
,
I
ca
n't
endure
it
,
really
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
other
,
exchanging
looks
with
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
am
quite
wrong
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
the
deuce
we
fell
on
this
unlucky
theme
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
free
and
manly
temper
,
I
know
,
"
said
Pinch
;
"
and
therefore
,
your
being
so
ungenerous
in
this
one
solitary
instance
,
only
grieves
me
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
my
pardon
you
have
to
ask
,
John
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
ME
nothing
but
kindnesses
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Pecksniff
's
pardon
then
,
"
said
young
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
Tom
,
or
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
Pecksniff
's
pardon
---
will
that
do
?
 
<EOS>
Here
!
<EOS>
let
us
drink
Pecksniff
's
health
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
cried
Tom
,
shaking
hands
with
him
eagerly
,
and
filling
a
bumper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
;
I
'll
drink
it
with
all
my
heart
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
's
health
,
and
prosperity
to
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
echoed
the
sentiment
,
or
nearly
so
;
for
he
drank
Mr
Pecksniff
's
health
,
and
Something
to
him
---
but
what
,
was
not
quite
audible
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
unanimity
being
then
completely
restored
,
they
drew
their
chairs
closer
round
the
fire
,
and
conversed
in
perfect
harmony
and
enjoyment
until
bed
-
time
.
   
<EOS>
No
slight
circumstance
,
perhaps
,
could
have
better
illustrated
the
difference
of
character
between
John
Westlock
and
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
than
the
manner
in
which
each
of
the
young
men
contemplated
Tom
Pinch
,
after
the
little
rupture
just
described
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
amount
of
jocularity
in
the
looks
of
both
,
no
doubt
,
but
there
all
resemblance
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
pupil
could
not
do
enough
to
show
Tom
how
cordially
he
felt
towards
him
,
and
his
friendly
regard
seemed
of
a
graver
and
more
thoughtful
kind
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
one
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
no
impulse
but
to
laugh
at
the
recollection
of
Tom
's
extreme
absurdity
;
and
mingled
with
his
amusement
there
was
something
slighting
and
contemptuous
,
indicative
,
as
it
appeared
,
of
his
opinion
that
Mr
Pinch
was
much
too
far
gone
in
simplicity
to
be
admitted
as
the
friend
,
on
serious
and
equal
terms
,
of
any
rational
man
.
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
,
who
did
nothing
by
halves
,
if
he
could
help
it
,
had
provided
beds
for
his
two
guests
in
the
hotel
;
and
after
a
very
happy
evening
,
they
retired
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
his
bed
with
his
cravat
and
shoes
off
,
ruminating
on
the
manifold
good
qualities
of
his
old
friend
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
his
chamber
door
,
and
the
voice
of
John
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
asleep
yet
,
are
you
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
no
!
<EOS>
not
I.
 
<EOS>
I
was
thinking
of
you
,
"
replied
Tom
,
opening
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
detail
you
,
"
said
John
;
"
but
I
have
forgotten
all
the
evening
a
little
commission
I
took
upon
myself
;
and
I
am
afraid
I
may
forget
it
again
,
if
I
fail
to
discharge
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
a
Mr
Tigg
,
Tom
<EOS>
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tigg
!
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tigg
!
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
who
borrowed
some
money
of
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
said
John
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
begged
me
to
present
his
compliments
,
and
to
return
it
with
many
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
Here
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
's
a
good
one
,
but
he
is
rather
a
doubtful
kind
of
customer
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
received
the
little
piece
of
gold
with
a
face
whose
brightness
might
have
shamed
the
metal
;
and
said
he
had
no
fear
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
glad
<EOS>
,
he
added
,
to
find
Mr
Tigg
so
prompt
and
honourable
in
his
dealings
;
very
glad
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Tom
,
"
replied
his
friend
,
"
he
is
not
always
so
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
take
my
advice
,
you
'll
avoid
him
as
much
as
you
can
,
in
the
event
of
your
encountering
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
by
no
means
,
Tom
---
pray
bear
this
in
mind
,
for
I
am
very
serious
---
by
no
means
lend
him
money
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
with
his
eyes
wide
open
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
very
far
from
being
a
reputable
acquaintance
,
"
returned
young
Westlock
;
"
and
the
more
you
let
him
know
you
think
so
,
<EOS>
the
better
for
you
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
John
,
"
quoth
Mr
Pinch
,
as
his
countenance
fell
,
and
he
shook
his
head
in
a
dejected
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
not
getting
into
bad
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
he
replied
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
uneasy
on
that
score
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
I
AM
uneasy
,
"
said
Tom
Pinch
;
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
when
I
hear
you
talking
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Tigg
is
what
you
describe
him
to
be
,
you
have
no
business
to
know
him
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
laugh
,
but
I
do
n't
consider
it
by
any
means
a
laughing
matter
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
composing
his
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
John
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
"
your
very
good
nature
and
kindness
of
heart
<EOS>
make
you
thoughtless
,
and
you
ca
n't
be
too
careful
on
such
a
point
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
if
I
thought
you
were
falling
among
bad
companions
,
I
should
be
quite
wretched
,
for
I
know
how
difficult
you
would
find
it
to
shake
them
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
have
lost
this
money
,
John
,
than
I
would
have
had
it
back
again
on
such
terms
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
my
dear
good
old
fellow
,
"
cried
his
friend
,
shaking
him
to
and
fro
with
both
hands
,
and
smiling
at
him
with
a
cheerful
,
open
countenance
,
that
would
have
carried
conviction
to
a
mind
much
more
suspicious
than
Tom
's
;
"
I
tell
you
there
is
no
danger
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
cried
Tom
,
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
;
I
am
overjoyed
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
there
is
not
,
when
you
say
so
in
that
manner
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
take
it
ill
,
John
,
<EOS>
that
I
said
what
I
did
just
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ill
!
"
said
the
other
,
giving
his
hand
a
hearty
squeeze
;
"
why
what
do
you
think
I
am
made
of
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
and
I
are
not
on
such
an
intimate
footing
that
you
need
be
at
all
uneasy
,
I
give
you
my
solemn
assurance
of
that
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
quite
comfortable
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
once
more
,
good
night
!
"
   
"
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Tom
;
"
and
such
pleasant
dreams
to
you
as
should
attend
the
sleep
of
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
Except
Pecksniff
,
"
said
his
friend
,
stopping
at
the
door
for
a
moment
,
and
looking
gaily
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Except
Pecksniff
,
"
answered
Tom
,
with
great
gravity
;
"
of
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
thus
they
parted
for
the
night
;
John
Westlock
full
of
light
-
heartedness
and
good
humour
,
and
poor
Tom
Pinch
quite
satisfied
;
though
still
,
as
he
turned
over
on
his
side
in
bed
,
he
muttered
to
himself
,
"
I
really
do
wish
,
for
all
that
,
though
,
that
he
was
n't
acquainted
with
Mr
Tigg
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
breakfasted
together
very
early
next
morning
,
for
the
two
young
men
desired
to
get
back
again
in
good
season
;
and
John
Westlock
was
to
return
to
London
by
the
coach
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
some
hours
to
spare
,
he
bore
them
company
for
three
or
four
miles
on
their
walk
,
and
only
parted
from
them
at
last
in
sheer
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
The
parting
was
an
unusually
hearty
one
,
not
only
as
between
him
and
Tom
Pinch
,
but
on
the
side
of
Martin
also
,
who
had
found
in
the
old
pupil
a
very
different
sort
of
person
from
the
milksop
he
had
prepared
himself
to
expect
.
   
<EOS>
Young
Westlock
stopped
upon
a
rising
ground
,
when
he
had
gone
a
little
distance
,
and
looked
back
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
walking
at
a
brisk
pace
,
and
Tom
appeared
to
be
talking
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
had
taken
off
his
greatcoat
,
the
wind
being
now
behind
them
,
and
carried
it
upon
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
looked
,
he
saw
Tom
relieve
him
of
it
,
after
a
faint
resistance
,
and
,
throwing
it
upon
his
own
,
encumber
himself
with
the
weight
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
This
trivial
incident
impressed
the
old
pupil
mightily
,
for
he
stood
there
,
gazing
after
them
,
until
they
were
hidden
from
his
view
;
when
he
shook
his
head
,
as
if
he
were
troubled
by
some
uneasy
reflection
,
and
thoughtfully
retraced
his
steps
to
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Martin
and
Tom
pursued
their
way
,
until
they
halted
,
safe
and
sound
,
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
,
where
a
brief
epistle
from
that
good
gentleman
to
Mr
Pinch
announced
the
family
's
return
by
that
night
's
coach
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
would
pass
the
corner
of
the
lane
at
about
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
Mr
Pecksniff
requested
that
the
gig
might
be
in
waiting
at
the
finger
-
post
about
that
time
,
together
with
a
cart
for
the
luggage
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
the
end
that
he
might
be
received
with
the
greater
honour
,
the
young
men
agreed
to
rise
early
,
and
be
upon
the
spot
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
least
cheerful
day
they
had
yet
passed
together
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
was
out
of
spirits
and
out
of
humour
,
and
took
every
opportunity
of
comparing
his
condition
and
prospects
with
those
of
young
Westlock
;
much
to
his
own
disadvantage
always
.
 
<EOS>
This
mood
of
his
depressed
Tom
;
and
neither
that
morning
's
parting
,
nor
yesterday
's
dinner
,
helped
to
mend
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
hours
dragged
on
heavily
enough
;
and
they
were
glad
to
go
to
bed
early
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
not
quite
so
glad
to
get
up
again
at
half
-
past
four
o'clock
,
in
all
the
shivering
discomfort
of
a
dark
winter
's
morning
;
but
they
turned
out
punctually
,
and
were
at
the
finger
-
post
full
half
-
an
-
hour
before
the
appointed
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
by
any
means
a
lively
morning
,
for
the
sky
was
black
and
cloudy
,
and
it
rained
hard
;
but
Martin
said
there
was
some
satisfaction
in
seeing
that
brute
of
a
horse
(
by
this
,
he
meant
Mr
Pecksniff
's
Arab
steed
)
getting
very
wet
;
and
that
he
rejoiced
,
on
his
account
,
that
it
rained
so
fast
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
it
may
be
inferred
that
Martin
's
spirits
had
not
improved
,
as
indeed
they
had
not
;
for
while
he
and
Mr
Pinch
stood
waiting
under
a
hedge
,
looking
at
the
rain
,
the
gig
,
the
cart
,
and
its
reeking
driver
,
he
did
nothing
but
grumble
;
and
,
but
that
it
is
indispensable
to
any
dispute
that
there
should
be
two
parties
to
it
<EOS>
,
he
would
certainly
have
picked
a
quarrel
with
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
noise
of
wheels
was
faintly
audible
in
the
distance
and
presently
the
coach
came
splashing
through
the
mud
and
mire
with
one
miserable
outside
passenger
crouching
down
among
wet
straw
,
under
a
saturated
umbrella
;
and
the
coachman
,
guard
,
and
horses
,
in
a
fellowship
of
dripping
wretchedness
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
on
its
stopping
,
Mr
Pecksniff
let
down
the
window
-
glass
and
hailed
Tom
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Mr
Pinch
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
that
you
are
out
upon
this
very
inclement
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
cried
Tom
,
advancing
eagerly
,
"
Mr
Chuzzlewit
and
I
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
not
so
much
at
Martin
as
at
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Do
me
the
favour
to
see
to
the
trunks
,
if
you
please
,
Mr
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Pecksniff
descended
,
and
helped
his
daughters
to
alight
;
but
neighter
he
nor
the
young
ladies
took
the
slightest
notice
of
Martin
,
who
had
advanced
to
offer
his
assistance
,
but
was
repulsed
by
Mr
Pecksniff
's
standing
immediately
before
his
person
,
with
his
back
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
same
manner
,
and
in
profound
silence
,
Mr
Pecksniff
handed
his
daughters
into
the
gig
;
and
following
himself
and
taking
the
reins
,
drove
off
home
.
   
<EOS>
Lost
in
astonishment
,
Martin
stood
staring
at
the
coach
,
and
when
the
coach
had
driven
away
,
at
Mr
Pinch
,
and
the
luggage
,
until
the
cart
moved
off
too
;
when
he
said
to
Tom
:
   
"
Now
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
what
THIS
portends
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
asked
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
fellow
's
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
's
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
You
saw
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
did
not
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
busy
with
the
trunks
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
matter
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
make
haste
back
!
"
<EOS>
And
without
another
word
started
off
at
such
a
pace
,
that
Tom
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
no
care
where
he
went
,
but
walked
through
little
heaps
of
mud
and
little
pools
of
water
with
the
utmost
indifference
;
looking
straight
before
him
,
and
sometimes
laughing
in
a
strange
manner
within
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
felt
that
anything
he
could
say
would
only
render
him
the
more
obstinate
,
and
therefore
trusted
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
manner
when
they
reached
the
house
,
to
remove
the
mistaken
impression
under
which
he
felt
convinced
so
great
a
favourite
as
the
new
pupil
must
unquestionably
be
labouring
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
a
little
amazed
himself
,
when
they
did
reach
it
,
and
entered
the
parlour
where
Mr
Pecksniff
was
sitting
alone
before
the
fire
,
drinking
some
hot
tea
,
to
find
that
instead
of
taking
favourable
notice
of
his
relative
and
keeping
him
,
Mr
Pinch
,
in
the
background
,
he
did
exactly
the
reverse
,
and
was
so
lavish
in
his
attentions
to
Tom
,
that
Tom
was
thoroughly
confounded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
some
tea
,
Mr
Pinch
---
take
some
tea
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
stirring
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
very
cold
and
damp
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
take
some
tea
,
and
come
into
a
warm
place
,
Mr
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
saw
that
Martin
looked
at
Mr
Pecksniff
as
though
he
could
have
easily
found
it
in
his
heart
to
give
HIM
an
invitation
to
a
very
warm
place
;
but
he
was
quite
silent
,
and
standing
opposite
that
gentleman
at
the
table
,
regarded
him
attentively
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
a
chair
,
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
chair
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
How
have
things
gone
on
in
our
absence
,
Mr
Pinch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
---
you
will
be
very
much
pleased
with
the
grammar
-
school
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
nearly
finished
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
have
the
goodness
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
waving
his
hand
and
smiling
,
"
we
will
not
discuss
anything
connected
with
that
question
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
YOU
been
doing
,
Thomas
,
humph
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
looked
from
master
to
pupil
,
and
from
pupil
to
master
,
and
was
so
perplexed
and
dismayed
that
he
wanted
presence
of
mind
to
answer
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
awkward
interval
,
Mr
Pecksniff
(
who
was
perfectly
conscious
of
Martin
's
gaze
,
though
he
had
never
once
glanced
towards
him
)
poked
the
fire
very
much
,
and
when
he
could
n't
do
that
any
more
,
drank
tea
assiduously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
said
Martin
at
last
,
in
a
very
quiet
voice
,
"
if
you
have
sufficiently
refreshed
and
recovered
yourself
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
what
you
mean
by
this
treatment
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
turning
his
eyes
on
Tom
Pinch
,
even
more
placidly
and
gently
than
before
,
"
what
have
YOU
been
doing
,
Thomas
,
humph
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
repeated
this
inquiry
,
he
looked
round
the
walls
of
the
room
as
if
he
were
curious
to
see
whether
any
nails
had
been
left
there
by
accident
in
former
times
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
almost
at
his
wit
's
end
what
to
say
between
the
two
,
and
had
already
made
a
gesture
as
if
he
would
call
Mr
Pecksniff
's
attention
to
the
gentleman
who
had
last
addressed
him
,
when
Martin
saved
him
further
trouble
,
by
doing
so
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
he
said
,
softly
rapping
the
table
twice
or
thrice
,
and
moving
a
step
or
two
nearer
,
so
that
he
could
have
touched
him
with
his
hand
;
"
you
heard
what
I
said
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
Do
me
the
favour
to
reply
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
you
"
---
he
raised
his
voice
a
little
here
---
"
what
you
mean
by
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
talk
to
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
in
a
severe
voice
,
as
he
looked
at
him
for
the
first
time
,
"
presently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
obliging
,
"
returned
Martin
;
"
presently
will
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
trouble
you
to
talk
to
me
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
made
a
feint
of
being
deeply
interested
in
his
pocketbook
,
but
it
shook
in
his
hands
;
he
trembled
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
retorted
Martin
,
rapping
the
table
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
.
 
Presently
will
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
Now
!
"
   
"
Do
you
threaten
me
,
sir
?
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
looked
at
him
,
and
made
no
answer
;
but
a
curious
observer
might
have
detected
an
ominous
twitching
at
his
mouth
,
and
perhaps
an
involuntary
attraction
of
his
right
hand
in
the
direction
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
cravat
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
lament
to
be
obliged
to
say
,
sir
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
that
it
would
be
quite
in
keeping
with
your
character
if
you
did
threaten
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
deceived
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
imposed
upon
a
nature
which
you
knew
to
be
confiding
and
unsuspicious
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
obtained
admission
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
rising
,
"
to
this
house
,
on
perverted
statements
and
on
false
pretences
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Go
on
,
"
said
Martin
,
with
a
scornful
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
now
.
<EOS>
What
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thus
much
more
,
sir
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
,
and
trying
to
rub
his
hands
,
as
though
he
were
only
cold
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
much
more
,
if
you
force
me
to
publish
your
shame
before
a
third
party
,
which
I
was
unwilling
and
indisposed
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
This
lowly
roof
,
sir
,
must
not
be
contaminated
by
the
presence
of
one
who
has
deceived
,
and
cruelly
deceived
,
an
honourable
,
beloved
,
venerated
,
and
venerable
gentleman
;
and
who
wisely
suppressed
that
deceit
from
me
when
he
sought
my
protection
and
favour
,
knowing
that
,
humble
as
I
am
,
I
am
an
honest
man
,
seeking
to
do
my
duty
in
this
carnal
universe
,
and
setting
my
face
against
all
vice
and
treachery
.
 
<EOS>
I
weep
for
your
depravity
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
;
"
I
mourn
over
your
corruption
,
I
pity
your
voluntary
withdrawal
of
yourself
from
the
flowery
paths
of
purity
and
peace
;
"
here
he
struck
himself
upon
his
breast
,
or
moral
garden
;
"
but
I
can
not
have
a
leper
and
a
serpent
for
an
inmate
.
 
<EOS>
Go
forth
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
stretching
out
his
hand
:
"
go
forth
,
young
man
!
 
<EOS>
Like
all
who
know
you
,
I
renounce
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
what
intention
Martin
made
a
stride
forward
at
these
words
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
to
know
that
Tom
Pinch
caught
him
in
his
arms
,
and
that
,
at
the
same
moment
,
Mr
Pecksniff
stepped
back
so
hastily
,
that
he
missed
his
footing
,
tumbled
over
a
chair
,
and
fell
in
a
sitting
posture
on
the
ground
;
where
he
remained
without
an
effort
to
get
up
again
,
with
his
head
in
a
corner
,
perhaps
considering
it
the
safest
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
Pinch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
shaking
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
hold
me
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
a
blow
could
make
him
a
more
abject
creature
than
he
is
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
if
I
spat
upon
him
,
I
could
degrade
him
to
a
lower
level
than
his
own
?
 
<EOS>
Look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
him
,
Pinch
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
involuntarily
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
sitting
,
as
has
been
already
mentioned
,
on
the
carpet
,
with
his
head
in
an
acute
angle
of
the
wainscot
,
and
all
the
damage
and
detriment
of
an
uncomfortable
journey
about
him
,
was
not
exactly
a
model
of
all
that
is
prepossessing
and
dignified
in
man
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
Still
he
WAS
Pecksniff
;
it
was
impossible
to
deprive
him
of
that
unique
and
paramount
appeal
to
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
returned
Tom
's
glance
,
as
if
he
would
have
said
,
"
Aye
,
Mr
Pinch
,
look
at
me
!
 
<EOS>
Here
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
the
Poet
says
about
an
honest
man
;
and
an
honest
man
is
one
of
the
few
great
works
that
can
be
seen
for
nothing
!
 
<EOS>
Look
at
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
that
as
he
lies
there
,
disgraced
,
bought
,
used
;
a
cloth
for
dirty
hands
,
a
mat
for
dirty
feet
,
a
lying
,
fawning
,
servile
hound
,
he
is
the
very
last
and
worst
among
the
vermin
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
And
mark
me
,
Pinch
!
 
<EOS>
The
day
will
come
---
he
knows
it
;
see
it
written
on
his
face
,
while
I
speak
!
<EOS>
---
when
even
you
will
find
him
out
,
and
will
know
him
as
I
do
,
and
as
he
knows
I
do
.
<EOS>
HE
renounce
ME
!
 
<EOS>
Cast
your
eyes
on
the
Renouncer
,
Pinch
,
and
be
the
wiser
for
the
recollection
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
pointed
at
him
as
he
spoke
,
with
unutterable
contempt
,
and
flinging
his
hat
upon
his
head
,
walked
from
the
room
and
from
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
so
rapidly
that
he
was
already
clear
of
the
village
,
when
he
heard
Tom
Pinch
calling
breathlessly
after
him
in
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
what
now
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
when
Tom
came
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
"
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
!
"
<EOS>
he
echoed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Going
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
so
much
mean
that
,
as
were
you
going
now
at
once
---
in
this
bad
weather
---
on
foot
---
without
your
clothes
---
<EOS>
with
no
money
?
"
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
answered
sternly
,
"
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
where
?
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
where
will
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
America
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
cried
Tom
,
in
a
kind
of
agony
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
there
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Think
better
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
so
dreadfully
regardless
of
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
to
America
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
mind
is
made
up
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
friend
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
America
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Pinch
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Take
this
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
pressing
a
book
upon
him
in
great
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
make
haste
back
,
and
ca
n't
say
anything
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
be
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
the
leaf
I
have
turned
down
.
 
<EOS>
Good

good

The
simple
fellow
wrung
him
by
the
hand
,
with
tears
stealing
down
his
cheeks
;
and
they
parted
hurriedly
upon
their
separate
ways

Chapter
13

<EOS>
Showing
what
became
of
martin
and
his
desparate
resolve
,
after
he
left
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
;
what
persons
he
encountered
;
what
anxieties
he
suffered
;
and
what
news
he
heard
 
Carrying
Tom
Pinch
's
book
quite
unconsciously
under
his
arm
,
and
not
even
buttoning
his
coat
as
a
protection
against
the
heavy
rain
,
Martin
went
doggedly
forward
at
the
same
quick
pace
,
until
he
had
passed
the
finger
-
post
,
and
was
on
the
high
road
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
slackened
very
little
in
his
speed
even
then
,
but
he
began
to
think
,
and
look
about
him
,
and
to
disengage
his
senses
from
the
coil
of
angry
passions
which
hitherto
had
held
them
prisoner
.
   
<EOS>
It
must
be
confessed
that
,
at
that
moment
,
he
had
no
very
agreeable
employment
either
for
his
moral
or
his
physical
perceptions
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
was
dawning
from
a
patch
of
watery
light
in
the
east
,
and
sullen
clouds
came
driving
up
before
it
,
from
which
the
rain
descended
in
a
thick
,
wet
mist
.
 
<EOS>
It
streamed
from
every
twig
and
bramble
in
the
hedge
;
made
little
gullies
in
the
path
;
ran
down
a
hundred
channels
in
the
road
;
and
punched
innumerable
holes
into
the
face
of
every
pond
and
gutter
.
 
<EOS>
It
fell
with
an
oozy
,
slushy
sound
among
the
grass
;
and
made
a
muddy
kennel
of
every
furrow
in
the
ploughed
fields
.
 
<EOS>
No
living
creature
was
anywhere
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
The
prospect
could
hardly
have
been
more
desolate
if
animated
nature
had
been
dissolved
in
water
,
and
poured
down
upon
the
earth
again
in
that
form
.
   
<EOS>
The
range
of
view
within
the
solitary
traveller
was
quite
as
cheerless
as
the
scene
without
.
 
<EOS>
Friendless
and
penniless
<EOS>
;
incensed
to
the
last
degree
;
deeply
wounded
in
his
pride
and
self
-
love
;
full
of
independent
schemes
,
and
perfectly
destitute
of
any
means
of
realizing
them
;
his
most
vindictive
enemy
might
have
been
satisfied
with
the
extent
of
his
troubles
.
 
<EOS>
To
add
to
his
other
miseries
,
he
was
by
this
time
sensible
of
being
wet
to
the
skin
,
and
cold
at
his
very
heart
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
deplorable
condition
he
remembered
Mr
Pinch
's
book
;
more
because
it
was
rather
troublesome
to
carry
,
than
from
any
hope
of
being
comforted
by
that
parting
gift
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
dingy
lettering
on
the
back
,
and
finding
it
to
be
an
odd
volume
of
the
"
Bachelor
of
Salamanca
,
"
in
the
French
tongue
,
cursed
Tom
Pinch
's
folly
twenty
times
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
it
away
,
in
his
ill
-
humour
and
vexation
,
when
he
bethought
himself
that
Tom
had
referred
him
to
a
leaf
,
turned
down
;
and
opening
it
at
that
place
,
that
he
might
have
additional
cause
of
complaint
against
him
for
supposing
that
any
cold
scrap
of
the
Bachelor
's
wisdom
could
cheer
him
in
such
circumstances
,
found
!
<EOS>
---
    
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
<EOS>
not
much
,
but
Tom
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
half
-
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
wrapped
it
hastily
in
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
pinned
it
to
the
leaf
.
<EOS>
These
words
were
scrawled
in
pencil
on
the
inside
:
"
I
do
n't
want
it
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
if
I
had
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
are
some
falsehoods
,
Tom
,
on
which
men
mount
,
as
on
bright
wings
,
towards
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
some
truths
,
cold
bitter
taunting
truths
,
wherein
your
worldly
scholars
are
very
apt
and
punctual
,
which
bind
men
down
to
earth
with
leaden
chains
.
 
<EOS>
Who
would
not
rather
have
to
fan
him
,
in
his
dying
hour
,
the
lightest
feather
of
a
falsehood
such
as
thine
,
than
all
the
quills
that
have
been
plucked
from
the
sharp
porcupine
,
reproachful
truth
,
since
time
began
!
   
<EOS>
Martin
felt
keenly
for
himself
,
and
he
felt
this
good
deed
of
Tom
's
keenly
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
minutes
it
had
the
effect
of
raising
his
spirits
,
and
reminding
him
that
he
was
not
altogether
destitute
,
as
he
had
left
a
fair
stock
of
clothes
behind
him
,
and
wore
a
gold
hunting
-
watch
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
a
curious
gratification
,
too
,
in
thinking
what
a
winning
fellow
he
must
be
to
have
made
such
an
impression
on
Tom
;
and
in
reflecting
how
superior
he
was
to
Tom
;
and
how
much
more
likely
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Animated
by
these
thoughts
,
and
strengthened
in
his
design
of
endeavouring
to
push
his
fortune
in
another
country
,
he
resolved
to
get
to
London
as
a
rallying
-
point
,
in
the
best
way
he
could
;
and
to
lose
no
time
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
ten
good
miles
from
the
village
made
illustrious
by
being
the
abiding
-
place
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
when
he
stopped
to
breakfast
at
a
little
roadside
alehouse
;
and
resting
upon
a
high
-
backed
settle
before
the
fire
,
pulled
off
his
coat
,
and
hung
it
before
the
cheerful
blaze
to
dry
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
different
place
from
the
last
tavern
in
which
he
had
regaled
;
boasting
no
greater
extent
of
accommodation
than
the
brick
-
floored
kitchen
yielded
;
but
the
mind
so
soon
accommodates
itself
to
the
necessities
of
the
body
,
that
this
poor
waggoner
's
house
-
of
-
call
,
which
he
would
have
despised
yesterday
,
became
now
quite
a
choice
hotel
;
while
his
dish
of
eggs
and
bacon
,
and
his
mug
of
beer
,
were
not
by
any
means
the
coarse
fare
he
had
supposed
,
but
fully
bore
out
the
inscription
on
the
window
-
shutter
,
which
proclaimed
those
viands
to
be
"
Good
entertainment
for
Travellers
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
pushed
away
his
empty
plate
;
and
with
a
second
mug
upon
the
hearth
before
him
,
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
until
his
eyes
ached
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
looked
at
the
highly
-
coloured
scripture
pieces
on
the
walls
,
in
little
black
frames
like
common
shaving
-
glasses
,
and
saw
how
the
Wise
Men
(
with
a
strong
family
likeness
among
them
)
worshipped
in
a
pink
manger
;
and
how
the
Prodigal
Son
came
home
in
red
rags
to
a
purple
father
,
and
already
feasted
his
imagination
on
a
sea
-
green
calf
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
glanced
through
the
window
at
the
falling
rain
,
coming
down
aslant
upon
the
sign
-
post
over
against
the
house
,
and
overflowing
the
horse
-
trough
;
and
then
he
looked
at
the
fire
again
,
and
seemed
to
descry
a
double
distant
London
,
retreating
among
the
fragments
of
the
burning
wood
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
repeated
this
process
in
just
the
same
order
,
many
times
,
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
necessity
,
when
the
sound
of
wheels
called
his
attention
to
the
window
out
of
its
regular
turn
;
and
there
he
beheld
a
kind
of
light
van
drawn
by
four
horses
,
and
laden
,
as
well
as
he
could
see
(
for
it
was
covered
in
)
,
with
corn
and
straw
.
 
<EOS>
The
driver
,
who
was
alone
,
stopped
at
the
door
to
water
his
team
,
and
presently
came
stamping
and
shaking
the
wet
off
his
hat
and
coat
,
into
the
room
where
Martin
sat
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
red
-
faced
burly
young
fellow
;
smart
in
his
way
,
and
with
a
good
-
humoured
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
advanced
towards
the
fire
he
touched
his
shining
forehead
with
the
forefinger
of
his
stiff
leather
glove
,
by
way
of
salutation
;
and
said
(
rather
unnecessarily
)
that
it
was
an
uncommon
wet
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
wet
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
as
ever
I
see
a
wetter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
felt
one
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
The
driver
glanced
at
Martin
's
soiled
dress
,
and
his
damp
shirt
-
sleeves
,
and
his
coat
hung
up
to
dry
;
and
said
,
after
a
pause
,
as
he
warmed
his
hands
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
caught
in
it
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
was
the
short
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Out
riding
,
maybe
?
"
said
the
driver
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
,
if
I
owned
a
horse
;
but
I
do
n't
,
"
returned
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
bad
,
"
said
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
may
be
worse
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
Now
the
driver
said
"
That
's
bad
,
"
not
so
much
because
Martin
did
n't
own
a
horse
,
as
because
he
said
he
did
n't
with
all
the
reckless
desperation
of
his
mood
and
circumstances
,
and
so
left
a
great
deal
to
be
inferred
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
whistled
when
he
had
retorted
on
the
driver
;
thus
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
did
n't
care
a
pin
for
Fortune
;
that
he
was
above
pretending
to
be
her
favourite
when
he
was
not
;
and
that
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
her
,
the
driver
,
and
everybody
else
.
   
<EOS>
The
driver
looked
at
him
stealthily
for
a
minute
or
so
;
and
in
the
pauses
of
his
warming
whistled
too
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
asked
,
as
he
pointed
his
thumb
towards
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
"
Up
or
down
?
"
   
"
Which
IS
up
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
London
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Up
then
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
He
tossed
his
head
in
a
careless
manner
afterwards
,
as
if
he
would
have
added
,
"
Now
you
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
put
his
hands
deeper
into
his
pockets
;
changed
his
tune
,
and
whistled
a
little
louder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
up
,
"
observed
the
driver
;
"
Hounslow
,
ten
miles
this
side
London
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
stopping
short
and
looking
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
driver
sprinkled
the
fire
with
his
wet
hat
until
it
hissed
again
and
answered
,
"
Aye
,
to
be
sure
he
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
I
'll
be
plain
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
suppose
from
my
dress
that
I
have
money
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
can
afford
for
coach
-
hire
is
a
crown
,
for
I
have
but
two
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
can
take
me
for
that
,
and
my
waistcoat
,
or
this
silk
handkerchief
,
do
.
<EOS>
If
you
ca
n't
,
leave
it
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Short
and
sweet
,
"
remarked
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
want
more
?
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
have
n't
got
more
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
it
,
so
there
's
an
end
of
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
began
to
whistle
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
say
I
wanted
more
,
did
I
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
driver
,
with
something
like
indignation
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
say
my
offer
was
enough
,
"
rejoined
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
could
I
,
when
you
would
n't
let
me
?
 
<EOS>
In
regard
to
the
waistcoat
,
I
would
n't
have
a
man
's
waistcoat
,
much
less
a
gentleman
's
waistcoat
,
on
my
mind
,
for
no
consideration
;
but
the
silk
handkerchief
's
another
thing
;
and
if
you
was
satisfied
when
we
got
to
Hounslow
,
I
should
n't
object
to
that
as
a
gift
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
bargain
,
then
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
,
"
returned
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
finish
this
beer
,
"
said
Martin
,
handing
him
the
mug
,
and
pulling
on
his
coat
with
great
alacrity
;
"
and
let
us
be
off
as
soon
as
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
two
minutes
more
he
had
paid
his
bill
,
which
amounted
to
a
shilling
;
was
lying
at
full
length
on
a
truss
of
straw
,
high
and
dry
at
the
top
of
the
van
,
with
the
tilt
a
little
open
in
front
for
the
convenience
of
talking
to
his
new
friend
;
and
was
moving
along
in
the
right
direction
with
a
most
satisfactory
and
encouraging
briskness
.
   
<EOS>
The
driver
's
name
,
as
he
soon
informed
Martin
,
was
William
Simmons
,
better
known
as
Bill
;
and
his
spruce
appearance
was
sufficiently
explained
by
his
connection
with
a
large
stage
-
coaching
establishment
at
Hounslow
,
whither
he
was
conveying
his
load
from
a
farm
belonging
to
the
concern
in
Wiltshire
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
frequently
up
and
down
the
road
on
such
errands
,
he
said
,
and
to
look
after
the
sick
and
rest
horses
,
of
which
animals
<EOS>
he
had
much
to
relate
that
occupied
a
long
time
in
the
telling
.
 
<EOS>
He
aspired
to
the
dignity
of
the
regular
box
,
and
expected
an
appointment
on
the
first
vacancy
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
musical
besides
,
and
had
a
little
key
-
bugle
in
his
pocket
,
on
which
,
whenever
the
conversation
flagged
,
he
played
the
first
part
of
a
great
many
tunes
,
and
regularly
broke
down
in
the
second
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bill
,
with
a
sigh
,
as
he
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
lips
,
and
put
this
instrument
in
his
pocket
,
after
screwing
off
the
mouth
-
piece
to
drain
it
;
"
Lummy
Ned
of
the
Light
Salisbury
,
HE
was
the
one
for
musical
talents
.
 
<EOS>
He
WAS
a
guard
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
may
call
a
Guard'an
Angel
,
was
Ned
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
dead
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
replied
the
other
,
with
a
contemptuous
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>

Not

<EOS>
You
wo
n't
catch
Ned
a
-
dying
easy
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
spoke
of
him
in
the
past
tense
,
"
observed
Martin
,
"
<EOS>
so
I
supposed
he
was
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
no
more
in
England
,
"
said
Bill
,
"
if
that
's
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
U
-
nited
States
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
he
?
"
asked
Martin
,
with
sudden
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
?
"
   
"
Five
year
ago
,
or
then
about
,
"
said
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
had
set
up
in
the
public
line
here
,
and
could
n't
meet
his
engagements
,
so
he
cut
off
to
Liverpool
one
day
,
without
saying
anything
about
it
,
and
went
and
shipped
himself
for
the
U
-
nited
States
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
as
he
landed
there
without
a
penny
to
bless
himself
with
,
of
course
they
wos
very
glad
to
see
him
in
the
U
-
nited
States
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
Martin
,
with
some
scorn
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
mean
?
"
said
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
THAT
.
 
<EOS>
All
men
are
alike
in
the
U
-
nited
States
,
an't
<EOS>
they
?
 
<EOS>
It
makes
no
odds
whether
a
man
has
a
thousand
pound
,
or
nothing
,
there
.
 
<EOS>
Particular
in
New
York
,
I
'm
told
,
where
Ned
landed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
New
York
,
was
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Martin
,
thoughtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
"
New
York
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
because
he
sent
word
home
that
it
brought
Old
York
to
his
mind
,
quite
vivid
,
in
consequence
of
being
so
exactly
unlike
it
in
every
respect
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
what
particular
business
Ned
turned
his
mind
to
,
when
he
got
there
;
but
he
wrote
home
that
him
and
his
friends
was
always
a
-
singing
,
Ale
Columbia
,
and
blowing
up
the
President
,
so
I
suppose
it
was
something
in
the
public
line
;
or
free
-
and
-
easy
way
again
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
he
made
his
fortune
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
cried
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
did
,
"
said
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
because
he
lost
it
all
the
day
after
,
in
six
-
and
-
twenty
banks
as
broke
.
 
<EOS>
He
settled
a
lot
of
the
notes
on
his
father
,
when
it
was
ascertained
that
they
was
really
stopped
and
sent
'em
over
with
a
dutiful
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
because
they
was
shown
down
our
yard
for
the
old
gentleman
's
benefit
,
that
he
might
treat
himself
with
tobacco
in
the
workus
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
foolish
fellow
not
to
take
care
of
his
money
when
he
had
it
,
"
said
Martin
,
indignantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
you
're
right
,
"
said
Bill
,
"
especially
as
it
was
all
in
paper
,
and
he
might
have
took
care
of
it
<EOS>
so
very
easy
,
by
folding
it
up
in
a
small
parcel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
said
nothing
in
reply
,
but
soon
afterwards
fell
asleep
,
and
remained
so
for
an
hour
or
more
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
,
finding
it
had
ceased
to
rain
,
he
took
his
seat
beside
the
driver
,
and
asked
him
several
questions
;
as
how
long
had
the
fortunate
guard
of
the
Light
Salisbury
been
in
crossing
the
Atlantic
;
at
what
time
of
the
year
had
he
sailed
;
what
was
the
name
of
the
ship
in
which
he
made
the
voyage
;
how
much
had
he
paid
for
passage
-
money
;
did
he
suffer
greatly
from
sea
-
sickness
?
<EOS>
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
these
points
of
detail
his
friend
was
possessed
of
little
or
no
information
;
either
answering
obviously
at
random
or
acknowledging
that
he
had
never
heard
,
or
had
forgotten
;
nor
,
although
he
returned
to
the
charge
very
often
,
could
he
obtain
any
useful
intelligence
on
these
essential
particulars
.
   
<EOS>
They
jogged
on
all
day
,
and
stopped
so
often
---
now
to
refresh
,
now
to
change
their
team
of
horses
,
now
to
exchange
or
bring
away
a
set
of
harness
,
now
on
one
point
of
business
,
and
now
upon
another
,
connected
with
the
coaching
on
that
line
of
road
---
that
it
was
midnight
when
they
reached
Hounslow
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
short
of
the
stables
for
which
the
van
was
bound
,
Martin
got
down
,
paid
his
crown
,
and
forced
his
silk
handkerchief
upon
his
honest
friend
,
notwithstanding
the
many
protestations
that
he
did
n't
wish
to
deprive
him
of
it
,
with
which
he
tried
to
give
the
lie
to
his
longing
looks
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
they
parted
company
;
and
when
the
van
had
driven
into
its
own
yard
and
the
gates
were
closed
,
Martin
stood
in
the
dark
street
,
with
a
pretty
strong
sense
of
being
shut
out
,
alone
,
upon
the
dreary
world
,
without
the
key
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
But
in
this
moment
of
despondency
,
and
often
afterwards
,
the
recollection
of
Mr
Pecksniff
operated
as
a
cordial
to
him
;
awakening
in
his
breast
an
indignation
that
was
very
wholesome
in
nerving
him
to
obstinate
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
influence
of
this
fiery
dram
he
started
off
for
London
without
more
ado
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
there
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
not
knowing
where
to
find
a
tavern
open
,
he
was
fain
to
stroll
about
the
streets
and
market
-
places
until
morning
.
   
<EOS>
He
found
himself
,
about
an
hour
before
dawn
,
in
the
humbler
regions
of
the
Adelphi
;
and
addressing
himself
to
a
man
in
a
fur
-
cap
,
who
was
taking
down
the
shutters
of
an
obscure
public
-
house
,
informed
him
that
he
was
a
stranger
,
and
inquired
if
he
could
have
a
bed
there
.
<EOS>
It
happened
by
good
luck
that
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
Though
none
of
the
gaudiest
,
it
was
tolerably
clean
,
and
Martin
felt
very
glad
and
grateful
when
he
crept
into
it
,
for
warmth
,
rest
,
and
forgetfulness
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
when
he
awoke
;
and
by
the
time
he
had
washed
and
dressed
,
and
broken
his
fast
,
it
was
growing
dusk
again
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
all
the
better
,
for
it
was
now
a
matter
of
absolute
necessity
that
he
should
part
with
his
watch
to
some
obliging
pawn
-
broker
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
waited
until
after
dark
for
this
purpose
,
though
it
had
been
the
longest
day
in
the
year
,
and
he
had
begun
it
without
a
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
He
passed
more
Golden
Balls
than
all
the
jugglers
in
Europe
have
juggled
with
,
in
the
course
of
their
united
performances
,
before
he
could
determine
in
favour
of
any
particular
shop
where
those
symbols
were
displayed
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
end
he
came
back
to
one
of
the
first
he
had
seen
,
and
entering
by
a
side
-
door
in
a
court
,
where
the
three
balls
,
with
the
legend
"
Money
Lent
,
"
were
repeated
in
a
ghastly
transparency
,
passed
into
one
of
a
series
of
little
closets
,
or
private
boxes
,
erected
for
the
accommodation
of
the
more
bashful
and
uninitiated
customers
.
 
<EOS>
He
bolted
himself
in
;
pulled
out
his
watch
;
and
laid
it
on
the
counter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
and
soul
!
"
said
a
low
voice
in
the
next
box
to
the
shopman
who
was
in
treaty
with
him
,
"
you
must
make
it
more
;
you
must
make
it
a
trifle
more
,
you
must
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
dispense
with
one
half
-
quarter
of
an
ounce
in
weighing
out
your
pound
of
flesh
,
my
best
of
friends
,
and
make
it
two
-
and
-
six
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
drew
back
involuntarily
,
for
he
knew
the
voice
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
always
full
of
your
chaff
,
"
said
the
shopman
,
rolling
up
the
article
(
which
looked
like
a
shirt
)
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
nibbing
his
pen
upon
the
counter
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
full
of
my
wheat
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
"
as
long
as
I
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Not
bad
!
 
<EOS>
Make
it
two
-
and
-
six
,
my
dear
friend
,
positively
for
this
occasion
only
.
 
<EOS>
Half
-
a
-
crown
is
a
delightful
coin
.
 
<EOS>
Two
-
and
-
six
.
 
<EOS>
Going
at
two
-
and
-
six
!
 
<EOS>
For
the
last
time
at
two
-
and
-
six
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
never
be
the
last
time
till
it
's
quite
worn
out
,
"
rejoined
the
shopman
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
grown
yellow
in
the
service
as
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Its
master
has
grown
yellow
in
the
service
,
if
you
mean
that
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
;
"
in
the
patriotic
service
of
an
ungrateful
country
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
making
it
two
-
and
-
six
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
making
it
,
"
returned
the
shopman
,
"
what
it
always
has
been
---
two
shillings
.
 
<EOS>
Same
name
as
usual
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Still
the
same
name
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
;
"
my
claim
to
the
dormant
peerage
not
being
yet
established
by
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
address
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
;
"
I
have
removed
my
town
establishment
from
thirty
-
eight
,
Mayfair
,
to
number
fifteen

hundred

forty

,
Park

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
I
'm
not
going
to
put
down
that
,
you
know
,
"
said
the
shopman
with
a
grin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
put
down
what
you
please
,
my
friend
,
"
<EOS>
quoth
Mr
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
still
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
The
apartments
for
the
under
-
butler
and
the
fifth
footman
being
of
a
most
confounded
low
and
vulgar
kind
at
thirty
-
eight
,
Mayfair
,
I
have
been
compelled
,
in
my
regard
for
the
feelings
which
do
them
so
much
honour
,
to
take
on
lease
for
seven
,
fourteen
,
or
twenty
-
one
years
,
renewable
at
the
option
of
the
tenant

the
elegant

commodious

forty

two
Park
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
Make
it
two
-
and
-
six
,
and
come
and
see
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
shopman
was
so
highly
entertained
by
this
piece
of
humour
that
Mr
Tigg
himself
could
not
repress
some
little
show
of
exultation
.
<EOS>
It
vented
itself
,
in
part
,
in
a
desire
to
see
how
the
occupant
of
the
next
box
received
his
pleasantry
;
to
ascertain
which
he
glanced
round
the
partition
,
and
immediately
,
by
the
gaslight
,
recognized
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
may
die
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
stretching
out
his
body
so
far
that
his
head
was
as
much
in
Martin
's
little
cell
as
Martin
's
own
head
was
,
"
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
tremendous
meetings
in
Ancient
or
Modern
History
!
 
<EOS>
How
are
you

<EOS>
What
is
the

from
the
agricultural
districts

<EOS>
How
are
our

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
David

pay
particular
attention
to
this
gentleman
immediately
,
as

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here

<EOS>
Please
to
give
me
the
most
you
can
for
this

"
said
Martin
,
handing
the
watch
to
the
shopman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
money
sorely
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
wants
money
,
sorely
!
"
cried
Mr
Tigg
with
excessive
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
David
,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
do
your
very
utmost
for
my
friend

wants
money
sorely

You

horizontal

warranted
to
perform
correctly

upon
my
personal
reputation
,
who
have
observed
it
narrowly
for
many
years
,
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
"
<EOS>
---
here
he
winked
at
Martin
,
that
he
might
understand
this
recommendation
would
have
an
immense
effect
upon
the
shopman
;
"
what
do
you
say
,
David
,
to
my
friend
?
 
<EOS>
Be
very
particular
to
deserve
my
custom

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
lend
you
three
pounds
on
this

if
you
like

said
the
shopman
to
Martin
,
confidentially
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
old
-
fashioned

<EOS>
I
could
n't
say
more

"
   
"
And
devilish
handsome

too

cried
Mr
Tigg
.

"
Two

twelve

six
for

and
seven

I
am
gratified

it
may
be
weakness

I
am

"
 
<EOS>
Here
he
winked
at
Martin
again
,
to
apprise
him
that
all
the
forms
and
ceremonies
prescribed
by
law
were
now
complied
with
,
and
nothing
remained
but
the
receipt
for
the
money
.
   
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
,
this
proved
to
be
the
case
,
for
Martin
,
who
had
no
resource
but
to
take
what
was
offered
him
,
signified
his
acquiescence
by
a
nod
of
his
head
,
and
presently
came
out
with
the
cash
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
joined
in
the
entry
by
Mr
Tigg
,
who
warmly
congratulated
him
,
as
he
took
his
arm
and
accompanied
him
into
the
street
,
on
the
successful
issue
of
the
negotiation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
for
my
part
in
the
same
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
"
do
n't
mention
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
compliment
me
,
for
I
ca
n't
bear
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
intention
,
I
assure
you
,
"
retorted
Martin
,
releasing
his
arm
and
stopping
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
oblige
me
very
much
"
said
Mr
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
observed
Martin
,
biting
his
lip
,
"
this
is
a
large
town
,
and
we
can
easily
find
different
ways
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
show
me
which
is
your
way
,
I
will
take
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
was
about
to
speak
,
but
Martin
interposed
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
need
scarcely
tell
you
,
after
what
you
have
just
seen
,
that
I
have
nothing
to
bestow
upon
your
friend
Mr
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
quite
as
unnecessary
for
me
to
tell
you
that
I
do
n't
desire
the
honour
of
your
company
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
"
cried
Mr
Tigg
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
most
remarkably
long
-
headed
,
flowing
-
bearded
,
and
patriarchal
proverb
,
which
observes
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
man
to
be
just
before
he
is
generous
.
 
<EOS>
Be
just
now
,
and
you
can
be
generous
presently
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
confuse
me
with
the
man
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
distinguish
the
man
Slyme
as
a
friend
of
mine
,
for
he
is
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
compelled
,
sir
,
to
abandon
the
party
whom
you
call
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
knowledge
of
the
party
whom
you
call
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
striking
himself
upon
the
breast
,
"
a
premium
tulip
,
of
a
very
different
growth
and
cultivation
from
the
cabbage
Slyme
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
matters
very
little
to
me
,
"
said
Martin
coolly
,
"
whether
you
have
set
up
as
a
vagabond
on
your
own
account
,
or
are
still
trading
on
behalf
of
Mr
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
hold
no
correspondence
with
you
.
<EOS>
In
the
devil
's
name
,
man
"
said
Martin
,
scarcely
able
,
despite
his
vexation
,
to
repress
a
smile
as
Mr
Tigg
stood
leaning
his
back
against
the
shutters
of
a
shop
window
,
adjusting
his
hair
with
great
composure
,
"
will
you
go
one
way
or
other
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
allow
me
to
remind
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
with
sudden
dignity
,
"
that
you
---
not
I
---
<EOS>
that
you
---
I
say
emphatically
,
YOU
---
have
reduced
the
proceedings
of
this
evening
to
a
cold
and
distant
matter
of
business
,
when
I
was
disposed
to
place
them
on
a
friendly
footing
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
made
a
matter
of
business
,
sir
,
I
beg
to
say
that
I
expect
a
trifle
(
which
I
shall
bestow
in
charity
)
as
commission
upon
the
pecuniary
advance
,
in
which
I
have
rendered
you
my
humble
services
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
terms
in
which
you
have
addressed
me
,
sir
,
"
concluded
Mr
Tigg
,
"
you
will
not
insult
me
,
if
you
please
,
by
offering
more
than
half
-
a
-
crown
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
drew
that
piece
of
money
from
his
pocket
,
and
tossed
it
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
caught
it
,
looked
at
it
to
assure
himself
of
its
goodness
,
spun
it
in
the
air
after
the
manner
of
a
pieman
,
and
buttoned
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
he
raised
his
hat
an
inch
or
two
from
his
head
with
a
military
air
,
and
,
after
pausing
a
moment
with
deep
gravity
,
as
to
decide
in
which
direction
he
should
go
,
and
to
what
Earl
or
Marquis
among
his
friends
he
should
give
the
preference
in
his
next
call
,
stuck
his
hands
in
his
skirt
-
pockets
and
swaggered
round
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
took
the
directly
opposite
course
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
to
his
great
content
,
they
parted
company
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
with
a
bitter
sense
of
humiliation
that
he
cursed
,
again
and
again
,
the
mischance
of
having
encountered
this
man
in
the
pawnbroker
's
shop
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
comfort
he
had
in
the
recollection
was
,
Mr
Tigg
's
voluntary
avowal
of
a
separation
between
himself
and
Slyme
,
that
would
at
least
prevent
his
circumstances
(
so
Martin
argued
)
from
being
known
to
any
member
of
his
family
,
the
bare
possibility
of
which
filled
him
with
shame
and
wounded
pride
.
 
<EOS>
Abstractedly
there
was
greater
reason
,
perhaps
,
for
supposing
any
declaration
of
Mr
Tigg
's
to
be
false
,
than
for
attaching
the
least
credence
to
it
;
but
remembering
the
terms
on
which
the
intimacy
between
that
gentleman
and
his
bosom
friend
had
subsisted
,
and
the
strong
probability
of
Mr
Tigg
's
having
established
an
independent
business
of
his
own
on
Mr
Slyme
's
connection
,
it
had
a
reasonable
appearance
of
probability
;
at
all
events
,
Martin
hoped
so
;
and
that
went
a
long
way
.
   
<EOS>
His
first
step
,
now
that
he
had
a
supply
of
ready
money
for
his
present
necessities
,
was
,
to
retain
his
bed
at
the
public
-
house
until
further
notice
,
and
to
write
a
formal
note
to
Tom
Pinch
(
for
he
knew
Pecksniff
would
see
it
)
<EOS>
requesting
to
have
his
clothes
forwarded
to
London
by
coach
,
with
a
direction
to
be
left
at
the
office
until
called
for
.
 
<EOS>
These
measures
taken
,
he
passed
the
interval
before
the
box
arrived
---
three
days
---
in
making
inquiries
relative
to
American
vessels
,
at
the
offices
of
various
shipping
-
agents
in
the
city
;
and
in
lingering
about
the
docks
and
wharves
,
with
the
faint
hope
of
stumbling
upon
some
engagement
for
the
voyage
,
as
clerk
or
supercargo
,
or
custodian
of
something
or
somebody
,
which
would
enable
him
to
procure
a
free
passage
.
 
<EOS>
But
finding
,
soon
,
that
no
such
means
of
employment
were
likely
to
present
themselves
,
and
dreading
the
consequences
of
delay
,
he
drew
up
a
short
advertisement
,
stating
what
he
wanted
,
and
inserted
it
in
the
leading
newspapers
.
 
<EOS>
Pending
the
receipt
of
the
twenty
or
thirty
answers
which
he
vaguely
expected
,
he
reduced
his
wardrobe
to
the
narrowest
limits
consistent
with
decent
respectability
,
and
carried
the
overplus
at
different
times
to
the
pawnbroker
's
shop
,
for
conversion
into
money
.
   
<EOS>
And
it
was
strange
,
very
strange
,
even
to
himself
,
to
find
how
,
by
quick
though
almost
imperceptible
degrees
,
he
lost
his
delicacy
and
self
-
respect
,
and
gradually
came
to
do
that
as
a
matter
of
course
,
without
the
least
compunction
,
which
but
a
few
short
days
before
had
galled
him
to
the
quick
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
time
he
visited
the
pawnbroker
's
,
he
felt
on
his
way
there
as
if
every
person
whom
he
passed
suspected
whither
he
was
going
;
and
on
his
way
back
again
,
as
if
the
whole
human
tide
he
stemmed
,
knew
well
where
he
had
come
from
.
 
<EOS>
When
did
he
care
to
think
of
their
discernment
now
!
 
<EOS>
In
his
first
wanderings
up
and
down
the
weary
streets
,
he
counterfeited
the
walk
of
one
who
had
an
object
in
his
view
;
but
soon
there
came
upon
him
the
sauntering
,
slipshod
gait
of
listless
idleness
,
and
the
lounging
at
street
-
corners
,
and
plucking
and
biting
of
stray
bits
of
straw
,
and
strolling
up
and
down
the
same
place
,
and
looking
into
the
same
shop
-
windows
,
with
a
miserable
indifference
,
fifty
times
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
came
out
from
his
lodging
with
an
uneasy
sense
of
being
observed
---
even
by
those
chance
passers
-
by
,
on
whom
he
had
never
looked
before
,
and
hundreds
to
one
would
never
see
again
---
 
issuing
in
the
morning
from
a
public
-
house
;
but
now
,
in
his
comings
-
out
and
goings
-
in
he
did
not
mind
to
lounge
about
the
door
,
or
to
stand
sunning
himself
in
careless
thought
beside
the
wooden
stem
,
studded
from
head
to
heel
with
pegs
,
on
which
the
beer
-
pots
dangled
like
so
many
boughs
upon
a
pewter
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
it
took
but
<EOS>
five
weeks
to
reach
the
lowest
round
of
this
tall
ladder
!
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
moralists
,
who
treat
of
happiness
and
self
-
respect
,
innate
in
every
sphere
of
life
,
and
shedding
light
on
every
grain
of
dust
in
God
's
highway
,
so
smooth
below
your
carriage
-
wheels
,
so
rough
beneath
the
tread
of
naked
feet
,
bethink
yourselves
in
looking
on
the
swift
descent
of
men
who
HAVE
lived
in
their
own
esteem
,
that
there
are
scores
of
thousands
breathing
now
,
and
breathing
thick
with
painful
toil
,
who
in
that
high
respect
have
never
lived
at
all
,
nor
had
a
chance
of
life
!
 
<EOS>
Go
ye
,
who
rest
so
placidly
upon
the
sacred
Bard
who
had
been
young
,
and
when
he
strung
his
harp
was
old
,
and
had
never
seen
the
righteous
forsaken
,
or
his
seed
begging
their
bread
;
go
,
Teachers
of
content
and
honest
pride
,
into
the
mine
,
the
mill
,
the
forge
,
the
squalid
depths
of
deepest
ignorance
,
and
uttermost
abyss
of
man
's
neglect
,
and
say
can
any
hopeful
plant
spring
up
in
air
so
foul
that
it
extinguishes
the
soul
's
bright
torch
as
fast
as
it
is
kindled
!
 
<EOS>
And
,
oh
!
ye
<EOS>
Pharisees
of
the
nineteen
hundredth
year
of
Christian
Knowledge
,
who
soundingly
appeal
to
human
nature
,
see
that
it
be
human
first
.
 
<EOS>
Take
heed
it
has
not
been
transformed
,
during
your
slumber
and
the
sleep
of
generations
,
into
the
nature
of
the
Beasts
!
   
<EOS>
Five
weeks
!
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
twenty
or
thirty
answers
,
not
one
had
come
.
<EOS>
His
money
---
even
the
additional
stock
he
had
raised
from
the
disposal
of
his
spare
clothes
(
and
that
was
not
much
,
for
clothes
,
though
dear
to
buy
,
are
cheap
to
pawn
)
---
was
fast
diminishing
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
what
could
he
do
?
 
<EOS>
At
times
an
agony
came
over
him
in
which
he
darted
forth
again
,
though
he
was
but
newly
home
,
and
,
returning
to
some
place
where
he
had
been
already
twenty
times
,
made
some
new
attempt
to
gain
his
end
,
but
always
unsuccessfully
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
years
and
years
too
old
for
a
cabin
-
boy
,
and
years
upon
years
too
inexperienced
to
be
accepted
as
a
common
seaman
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
and
manner
,
too
,
militated
fatally
against
any
such
proposal
as
the
latter
;
and
yet
he
was
reduced
to
making
it
;
for
even
if
he
could
have
contemplated
the
being
set
down
in
America
totally
without
money
,
he
had
not
enough
left
now
for
a
steerage
passage
and
the
poorest
provisions
upon
the
voyage
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
an
illustration
of
a
very
common
tendency
in
the
mind
of
man
,
that
all
this
time
he
never
once
doubted
,
one
may
almost
say
the
certainty
of
doing
great
things
in
the
New
World
,
if
he
could
only
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
In
proportion
as
he
became
more
and
more
dejected
by
his
present
circumstances
,
and
the
means
of
gaining
America
receded
from
his
grasp
,
the
more
he
fretted
himself
with
the
conviction
that
that
was
the
only
place
in
which
he
could
hope
to
achieve
any
high
end
,
and
worried
his
brain
with
the
thought
that
men
going
there
in
the
meanwhile
might
anticipate
him
in
the
attainment
of
those
objects
which
were
dearest
to
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
often
thought
of
John
Westlock
,
and
besides
looking
out
for
him
on
all
occasions
,
actually
walked
about
London
for
three
days
together
for
the
express
purpose
of
meeting
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
although
he
failed
in
this
;
and
although
he
would
not
have
scrupled
to
borrow
money
of
him
;
and
although
he
believed
that
John
would
have
lent
it
;
yet
still
he
could
not
bring
his
mind
to
write
to
Pinch
and
inquire
where
he
was
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
For
although
,
as
we
have
seen
,
he
was
fond
of
Tom
after
his
own
fashion
,
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
(
feeling
so
superior
to
Tom
)
of
making
him
the
stepping
-
stone
to
his
fortune
,
or
being
anything
to
him
but
a
patron
;
and
his
pride
so
revolted
from
the
idea
that
it
restrained
him
even
now
.
   
<EOS>
It
might
have
yielded
,
however
;
and
no
doubt
must
have
yielded
soon
,
but
for
a
very
strange
and
unlooked
-
for
occurrence
.
   
<EOS>
The
five
weeks
had
quite
run
out
,
and
he
was
in
a
truly
desperate
plight
,
<EOS>
when
one
evening
,
having
just
returned
to
his
lodging
,
and
being
in
the
act
of
lighting
his
candle
at
the
gas
jet
in
the
bar
before
stalking
moodily
upstairs
to
his
own
room
,
his
landlord
called
him
by
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
Now
as
he
had
never
told
it
to
the
man
,
but
had
scrupulously
kept
it
to
himself
,
he
was
not
a
little
startled
by
this
;
and
so
plainly
showed
his
agitation
that
the
landlord
,
to
reassure
him
,
said
"
it
was
only
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
letter
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
Mr
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
reading
the
superscription
of
one
he
held
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Noon
.
 
<EOS>
Chief
office
.
<EOS>
Paid
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
took
it
from
him
,
thanked
him
,
and
walked
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
sealed
,
but
pasted
close
;
the
handwriting
was
quite
unknown
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
opened
it
and
found
enclosed
,
without
any
name
,
address
,
or
other
inscription
or
explanation
of
any
kind
whatever
,
a
Bank
of
England
note
for
Twenty
Pounds
.
   
<EOS>
To
say
that
he
was
perfectly
stunned
with
astonishment
and
delight
;
that
he
looked
again
and
again
at
the
note
and
the
wrapper
;
that
he
hurried
below
stairs
to
make
quite
certain
that
the
note
was
a
good
note
;
and
then
hurried
up
again
to
satisfy
himself
for
the
fiftieth
time
that
he
had
not
overlooked
some
scrap
of
writing
on
the
wrapper
;
that
he
exhausted
and
bewildered
himself
with
conjectures
;
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
but
that
there
the
note
was
,
and
he
was
suddenly
enriched
;
would
be
only
to
relate
so
many
matters
of
course
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
The
final
upshot
of
the
business
at
that
time
was
,
that
he
resolved
to
treat
himself
to
a
comfortable
but
frugal
meal
in
his
own
chamber
;
and
having
ordered
a
fire
to
be
kindled
,
went
out
to
purchase
it
forthwith
.
   
<EOS>
He
bought
some
cold
beef
,
and
ham
,
and
French
bread
,
and
butter
,
and
came
back
with
his
pockets
pretty
heavily
laden
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
somewhat
of
a
damping
circumstance
to
find
the
room
full
of
smoke
,
which
was
attributable
to
two
causes
;
firstly
,
to
the
flue
being
naturally
vicious
and
a
smoker
;
and
secondly
,
to
their
having
forgotten
,
in
lighting
the
fire
,
an
odd
sack
or
two
and
some
trifles
,
which
had
been
put
up
the
chimney
to
keep
the
rain
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
already
remedied
this
oversight
,
however
;
and
propped
up
the
window
-
sash
with
a
bundle
of
firewood
to
keep
it
open
;
so
that
except
in
being
rather
inflammatory
to
the
eyes
and
choking
to
the
lungs
,
the
apartment
was
quite
comfortable
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
was
in
no
vein
to
quarrel
with
it
,
if
it
had
been
in
less
tolerable
order
,
especially
when
a
gleaming
pint
of
porter
was
set
upon
the
table
,
and
the
servant
-
girl
withdrew
,
bearing
with
her
particular
instructions
relative
to
the
production
of
something
hot
when
he
should
ring
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
The
cold
meat
being
wrapped
in
a
playbill
,
Martin
laid
the
cloth
by
spreading
that
document
on
the
little
round
table
with
the
print
downwards
,
and
arranging
the
collation
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
foot
of
the
bed
,
which
was
very
close
to
the
fire
,
answered
for
a
sideboard
;
and
when
he
had
completed
these
preparations
,
he
squeezed
an
old
arm
-
chair
into
the
warmest
corner
,
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
himself
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
begun
to
eat
with
great
appetite
,
glancing
round
the
room
meanwhile
with
a
triumphant
anticipation
of
quitting
it
for
ever
on
the
morrow
,
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
stealthy
footstep
on
the
stairs
,
and
presently
by
a
knock
at
his
chamber
door
,
which
,
although
it
was
a
gentle
knock
enough
,
communicated
such
a
start
to
the
bundle
of
firewood
,
that
it
instantly
leaped
out
of
window
,
and
plunged
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
More
coals
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
an't
a
liberty
,
sir
,
though
it
seems
so
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
a
man
's
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
servant
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Hope
<EOS>
you
're
pretty
well
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
stared
at
the
face
that
was
bowing
in
the
doorway
,
perfectly
remembering
the
features
and
expression
,
but
quite
forgetting
to
whom
they
belonged
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tapley
,
sir
,
"
said
his
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Him
as
formerly
lived
at
the
Dragon
,
sir
,
and
was
forced
to
leave
in
consequence
of
a
want
of
jollity
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
did
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Right
through
the
passage
,
and
up
the
stairs
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
find
me
out
,
I
mean
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
I
've
passed
you
once
or
twice
in
the
street
,
if
I
'm
not
mistaken
;
and
when
I
was
a
-
looking
in
at
the
beef
-
and
-
ham
shop
just
now
,
along
with
a
hungry
sweep
,
as
was
very
much
calculated
to
make
a
man
jolly
,
sir
---
I
see
you
a
-
buying
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
reddened
as
he
pointed
to
the
table
,
and
said
,
somewhat
hastily
:
   
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
What
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
I
made
bold
to
foller
;
and
as
I
told
'em
downstairs
that
you
expected
me
,
I
was
let
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
charged
with
any
message
,
that
you
told
them
you
were
expected
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
an't
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
what
you
may
call
a
pious
fraud
,
sir
,
that
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
cast
an
angry
look
at
him
;
but
there
was
something
in
the
fellow
's
merry
face
,
and
in
his
manner
---
which
with
all
its
cheerfulness
was
far
from
being
obtrusive
or
familiar
---
that
quite
disarmed
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
lived
a
solitary
life
too
,
for
many
weeks
,
and
the
voice
was
pleasant
in
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tapley
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
'll
deal
openly
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
From
all
I
can
judge
and
from
all
I
have
heard
of
you
through
Pinch
,
you
are
not
a
likely
kind
of
fellow
to
have
been
brought
here
by
impertinent
curiosity
or
any
other
offensive
motive
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
as
lieve
stand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
sit
down
,
"
retorted
Martin
,
"
I
'll
not
talk
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
sir
,
"
observed
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
will
's
a
law
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Down
it
is
;
"
and
he
sat
down
accordingly
upon
the
bedstead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Help
yourself
,
"
said
Martin
,
handing
him
the
only
knife
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
you
've
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
take
it
now
,
you
'll
not
have
any
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
good
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
being
your
desire
---
now
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
which
reply
he
gravely
helped
himself
and
went
on
eating
.
<EOS>
Martin
having
done
the
like
for
a
short
time
in
silence
,
said
abruptly
:
   
"
What
are
you
doing
in
London
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
's
that
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
a
place
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
for
you
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
To
attend
upon
a
single
gentleman
,
"
resumed
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
from
the
country
the
more
desirable
.
 
<EOS>
Makeshifts
would
be
preferred
.
 
<EOS>
Wages
<EOS>
no
object
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
this
so
pointedly
,
that
Martin
stopped
in
his
eating
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
If
you
mean
me
---
"
   
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
sir
,
"
interposed
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
may
judge
from
my
style
of
living
here
,
of
my
means
of
keeping
a
man
-
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
am
going
to
America
immediately
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
,
quite
unmoved
by
this
intelligence
"
from
all
that
<EOS>
ever
I
heard
about
it
,
I
should
say
America
is
a
very
likely
sort
of
place
for
me
to
be
jolly
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Martin
looked
at
him
angrily
;
and
again
his
anger
melted
away
in
spite
of
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
what
is
the
use
of
us
a
-
going
round
and
round
,
and
hiding
behind
the
corner
,
and
dodging
up
and
down
,
when
we
can
come
straight
to
the
point
in
six
words
?
 
<EOS>
I
've
had
my
eye
upon
you
any
time
this
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
<EOS>
well
enough
there
's
a
screw
loose
in
your
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
know'd
<EOS>
well
enough
the
first
time
I
see
you
down
at
the
Dragon
that
it
must
be
so
,
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
here
am
I
,
without
a
sitiwation
;
without
any
want
of
wages
for
a
year
to
come
;
for
I
saved
up
<EOS>
(
I
did
n't
mean
to
do
it
,
but
I
could
n't
help
it
)
at
the
Dragon
---
<EOS>
here
am
I
with
a
liking
for
what
's
wentersome
,
and
a
liking
for
you
,
and
a
wish
to
come
out
strong
under
circumstances
as
would
keep
other
men
down
;
and
will
you
take
me
,
or
will
you
leave
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
take
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
say
take
,
"
rejoined
Mark
,
"
I
mean
will
you
let
me
go
?
<EOS>
and
when
I
say
will
you
let
me
go
<EOS>
,
I
mean
will
you
let
me
go
along
with
you
?
<EOS>
for
go
<EOS>
I
will
,
somehow
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
you
've
said
America
<EOS>
,
I
see
clear
at
once
,
that
that
's
the
place
for
me
to
be
jolly
in
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
if
I
do
n't
pay
my
own
passage
in
the
ship
you
go
in
,
sir
,
I
'll
pay
my
own
passage
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
And
mark
my
words
,
if
I
go
alone
it
shall
be
,
to
carry
out
the
principle
,
in
the
rottenest
,
craziest
,
leakingest
tub
of
a
wessel
that
a
place
can
be
got
in
for
love
or
money
.
 
<EOS>
So
if
I
'm
lost
upon
the
way
,
sir
,
there
'll
be
a
drowned
man
at
your
door
---
and
always
a
-
knocking
double
knocks
at
it
,
too
,
or
never
trust
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
mere
folly
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
good
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
because
if
you
do
n't
mean
to
let
me
go
,
you
'll
be
more
comfortable
,
perhaps
,
on
account
of
thinking
so
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
contradict
no
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
I
say
is
,
that
if
I
do
n't
emigrate
to
America
in
that
case
,
in
the
beastliest
old
cockle
-
shell
as
goes
out
of
port
,
I
'm
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
You
do
n't
mean
what
you
say
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
I
do
,
"
cried
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
know
better
,
"
rejoined
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
good
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
with
the
same
air
of
perfect
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
it
stand
that
way
at
present
,
sir
,
and
wait
and
see
how
it
turns
out
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
love
my
heart
alive
!
<EOS>
the
only
doubt
I
have
is
,
whether
there
's
any
credit
in
going
with
a
gentleman
like
you
<EOS>
,
that
's
as
certain
to
make
his
way
there
as
a
gimlet
<EOS>
is
to
go
through
soft
deal
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
touching
Martin
on
his
weak
point
,
and
having
him
at
a
great
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
thinking
,
either
,
what
a
brisk
fellow
this
Mark
was
,
and
how
great
a
change
he
had
wrought
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
dismal
little
room
already
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
certainly
,
Mark
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
hopes
of
doing
well
there
,
or
I
should
n't
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
the
qualifications
for
doing
well
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
you
have
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Everybody
knows
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
Martin
,
leaning
his
chin
upon
his
hand
,
and
looking
at
the
fire
,
"
ornamental
architecture
applied
to
domestic
purposes
,
can
hardly
fail
to
be
in
great
request
in
that
country
;
for
men
are
constantly
changing
their
residences
there
,
and
moving
further
off
;
and
it
's
clear
they
must
have
houses
to
live
in
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
sir
,
"
observed
Mark
,
"
that
that
's
a
state
of
things
as
opens
one
of
the
jolliest
look
-
outs
for
domestic
architecture
that
ever
I
heerd
tell
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
glanced
at
him
hastily
,
not
feeling
quite
free
from
a
suspicion
that
this
remark
implied
a
doubt
of
the
successful
issue
of
his
plans
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Tapley
was
eating
the
boiled
beef
and
bread
with
such
entire
good
faith
and
singleness
of
purpose
expressed
in
his
visage
that
he
could
not
but
be
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
Another
doubt
arose
in
his
mind
however
,
as
this
one
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
He
produced
the
blank
cover
in
which
the
note
had
been
enclosed
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
Mark
as
he
put
it
in
his
hands
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
anything
about
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
turned
it
over
and
over
;
held
it
near
his
eyes
;
held
it
away
from
him
at
arm
's
length
;
held
it
with
the
superscription
upwards
and
with
the
superscription
downwards
;
and
shook
his
head
with
such
a
genuine
expression
of
astonishment
at
being
asked
the
question
,
that
Martin
said
,
as
he
took
it
from
him
again
:
   
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
see
you
do

<EOS>
How
should
you
!
 
<EOS>
Though
,
indeed
,
your
knowing
about
it
would
not
be
more
extraordinary
than
its
being
here
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Tapley
,
"
he
added
,
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
<EOS>
"
I
'll
trust
you
with
my
history
,
such
as
it
is
,
and
then
you
'll
see
more
clearly
what
sort
of
fortunes
you
would
link
yourself
to
,
if
you
followed
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
;
"
but
afore
you
enter
upon
it
will
you
take
me
if
I
choose
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
turn
off
me
---
Mark
Tapley
---
formerly
of
the
Blue
Dragon
,
as
can
be
well
recommended
by
Mr
Pinch
,
and
as
wants
a
gentleman
of
your
strength
of
mind
to
look
up
to
;
or
will
you
,
in
climbing
the
ladder
as
you
're
certain
to
get
to
the
top
of
,
take
me
along
with
you
at
a
respectful
dutance
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
it
's
of
very
little
importance
to
you
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
there
's
the
difficulty
;
but
it
's
of
very
great
importance
to
me
,
and
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
consider
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
If
this
were
meant
as
a
second
appeal
to
Martin
's
weak
side
,
founded
on
his
observation
of
the
effect
of
the
first
,
Mr
Tapley
was
a
skillful
and
shrewd
observer
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
an
intentional
or
an
accidental
shot
,
it
hit
the
mark
fully
for
Martin
,
relenting
more
and
more
,
said
with
a
condescension
which
was
inexpressibly
delicious
to
him
,
after
his
recent
humiliation
:
   
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
about
it
,
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
tell
me
in
what
disposition
you
find
yourself
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
"
the
job
's
done
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
,
sir
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
all
attention
.
"
   
<EOS>
Throwing
himself
back
in
his
arm
-
chair
,
and
looking
at
the
fire
,
with
now
and
then
a
glance
at
Mark
,
who
at
such
times
nodded
his
head
sagely
,
to
express
his
profound
interest
and
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
ran
over
the
chief
points
in
his
history
,
to
the
same
effect
as
he
had
related
them
,
weeks
before
,
to
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
adapted
them
,
according
to
the
best
of
his
judgment
,
to
Mr
Tapley
's
comprehension
;
and
with
that
view
made
as
light
of
his
love
affair
as
he
could
,
and
referred
to
it
in
very
few
words
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
he
reckoned
without
his
host
;
for
Mark
's
interest
was
keenest
in
this
part
of
the
business
,
and
prompted
him
to
ask
sundry
questions
in
relation
to
it
;
for
which
he
apologised
as
one
in
some
measure
privileged
to
do
so
,
from
having
seen
(
as
Martin
explained
to
him
)
<EOS>
the
young
lady
at
the
Blue
Dragon
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
young
lady
as
any
gentleman
ought
to
feel
more
proud
of
being
in
love
with
,
"
said
Mark
,
energetically
,
"
do
n't
draw
breath
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
 
<EOS>
You
saw
her
when
she
was
not
happy
,
"
said
Martin
,
gazing
at
the
fire
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
seen
her
in
the
old
times
,
indeed
---
"
   
"
Why
,
she
certainly
was
a
little
down
-
hearted
,
sir
,
and
something
paler
in
her
colour
than
I
could
have
wished
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
but
none
the
worse
in
her
looks
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
seemed
better
,
sir
,
after
she
come
to
London
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
withdrew
his
eyes
from
the
fire
;
stared
at
Mark
as
if
he
thought
he
had
suddenly
gone
mad
;
and
asked
him
what
he
meant
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
offence
intended
,
sir
,
"
urged
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
she
was
any
the
happier
without
you
;
but
I
thought
she
was
a
-
looking
better
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
she
has
been
in
London
?
"
asked
Martin
,
rising
hurriedly
,
and
pushing
back
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
,
"
said
Mark
,
rising
too
,
in
great
amazement
from
the
bedstead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
she
is
in
London
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Most
likely
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
say
she
was
a
week
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
know
where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Martin
,
clutching
him
by
both
arms
<EOS>
,
"
I
have
never
seen
her
since
I
left
my
grandfather
's
house
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
then
!
"
cried
Mark
,
giving
the
little
table
such
a
blow
with
his
clenched
fist
that
the
slices
of
beef
and
ham
danced
upon
it
,
while
all
his
features
seemed
,
with
delight
,
to
be
going
up
into
his
forehead
,
and
never
coming
back
again
any
more
,
"
<EOS>
if
I
an't
your
nat'ral
born
servant
,
hired
by
Fate
,
there
an't
<EOS>
such
a
thing
in
natur
"
as
a
Blue
Dragon
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
when
I
was
a
-
rambling
up
and
down
a
old
churchyard
in
the
City
,
getting
myself
into
a
jolly
state
,
did
n't
I
see
your
grandfather
a
-
toddling
to
and
fro
for
pretty
nigh
a
mortal
hour
!
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
watch
him
into
Todgers
's
commercial
boarding
-
house
,
and
watch
him
out
,
and
watch
him
home
to
his
hotel
,
and
go
and
tell
him
as
his
was
the
service
for
my
money
,
and
I
had
said
so
,
<EOS>
afore
I
left
the
Dragon
!
 
<EOS>
Was
n't
the
young
lady
a
-
sitting
with
him
then
,
and
did
n't
she
fall
a
-
laughing
in
a
manner
as
was
beautiful
to
see
!
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
your
grandfather
say
,
"
Come
back
again
next
week
,
"
and
did
n't
I
go
next
week
;
and
did
n't
he
say
that
he
could
n't
make
up
his
mind
to
trust
nobody
no
more
;
and
therefore
would
n't
engage
me
,
but
at
the
same
time
stood
something
to
drink
as
was
handsome
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
"
cried
Mr
Tapley
,
with
a
comical
mixture
of
delight
and
chagrin
,
"
<EOS>
where
's
<EOS>
the
credit
of
a
man
's
being
jolly
under
such
circumstances
!
 
<EOS>
Who
could
help
it
,
when
things
come
about
like
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
For
some
moments
Martin
stood
gazing
at
him
,
as
if
he
really
doubted
the
evidence
of
his
senses
,
and
could
not
believe
that
Mark
stood
there
,
in
the
body
,
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
asked
him
whether
,
if
the
young
lady
were
still
in
London
,
he
thought
he
could
contrive
to
deliver
a
letter
to
her
secretly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
think
I
can
?
"
cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
THINK
I
can
?
 
<EOS>
Here
,
sit
down
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Write
it
out
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
cleared
the
table
by
the
summary
process
of
tilting
everything
upon
it
into
the
fireplace
;
snatched
some
writing
materials
from
the
mantel
-
shelf
;
set
Martin
's
chair
before
them
;
forced
him
down
into
it
;
dipped
a
pen
into
the
ink
;
and
put
it
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cut
away
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Make
it
strong
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
be
wery
pinted
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Do
I
think
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
work
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
required
no
further
adjuration
,
but
went
to
work
at
a
great
rate
;
while
Mr
Tapley
,
installing
himself
without
any
more
formalities
into
the
functions
of
his
valet
and
general
attendant
,
divested
himself
of
his
coat
,
and
went
on
to
clear
the
fireplace
and
arrange
the
room
;
talking
to
himself
in
a
low
voice
the
whole
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jolly
sort
of
lodgings
,
"
said
Mark
,
rubbing
his
nose
with
the
knob
at
the
end
of
the
fire
-
shovel
,
and
looking
round
the
poor
chamber
;
"
that
's
a
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
's
come
through
the
roof
too
.
 
<EOS>
That
an't
bad
.
 
<EOS>
A
lively
old
bedstead
,
I
'll
be
bound

popilated
by
lots
of
wampires
,
no
doubt

<EOS>
Come

<EOS>
my

a

getting
up
again

An
uncommon
ragged
nightcap

A

We
shall

yet

<EOS>
Here

Jane

my

calling
down
the
stairs

up

hot

That

to
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go

<EOS>
Be

Chapter
14
.
<EOS>
In
which
Martin
bids
adieu
to
the
lady
of
his
love
;
and
honours
an
obscure
individual
whose
fortune
he
intends
to
make
by
commending
her
to
his
protection
 
<EOS>
The
letter
being
duly
signed
,
sealed
,
and
delivered
,
was
handed
to
Mark
Tapley
,
for
immediate
conveyance
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
succeeded
so
well
in
his
embassy
as
to
be
enabled
to
return
that
same
night
,
just
as
the
house
was
closing
,
with
the
welcome
intelligence
that
he
had
sent
it
upstairs
to
the
young
lady
,
enclosed
in
a
small
manuscript
of
his
own
,
purporting
to
contain
his
further
petition
to
be
engaged
in
Mr
Chuzzlewit
's
service
;
and
that
she
had
herself
come
down
and
told
him
,
in
great
haste
and
agitation
,
that
she
would
meet
the
gentleman
at
eight
o'clock
to
-
morrow
morning
in
St.
James
's
Park
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
agreed
between
the
new
master
and
the
new
man
,
that
Mark
should
be
in
waiting
near
the
hotel
in
good
time
,
to
escort
the
young
lady
to
the
place
of
appointment
;
and
when
they
had
parted
for
the
night
with
this
understanding
,
Martin
took
up
his
pen
again
;
and
before
he
went
to
bed
wrote
another
letter
,
whereof
more
will
be
seen
presently
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
up
before
daybreak
,
and
came
upon
the
Park
with
the
morning
,
which
was
clad
in
the
least
engaging
of
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
-
five
dresses
in
the
wardrobe
of
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
raw
,
damp
,
dark
,
and
dismal
;
the
clouds
were
as
muddy
as
the
ground
;
and
the
short
perspective
of
every
street
and
avenue
was
closed
up
by
the
mist
as
by
a
filthy
curtain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fine
weather
indeed
,
"
Martin
bitterly
soliloquised
,
"
to
be
wandering
up
and
down
here
in
,
like
a
thief
!
 
<EOS>
Fine
weather
indeed
,
for
a
meeting
of
lovers
in
the
open
air
,
and
in
a
public
walk
!
 
<EOS>
I
need
be
departing
,
with
all
speed
,
for
another
country
;
for
I
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
in
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
might
perhaps
have
gone
on
to
reflect
that
of
all
mornings
in
the
year
,
it
was
not
the
best
calculated
for
a
young
lady
's
coming
forth
on
such
an
errand
,
either
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
stopped
on
the
road
to
this
reflection
,
if
his
thoughts
tended
that
way
,
by
her
appearance
at
a
short
distance
,
on
which
he
hurried
forward
to
meet
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
squire
,
Mr
Tapley
,
at
the
same
time
fell
discreetly
back
,
and
surveyed
the
fog
above
him
with
an
appearance
of
attentive
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Martin
,
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Mary
,
"
said
Martin
;
and
lovers
are
such
a
singular
kind
of
people
that
this
is
all
they
did
say
just
then
,
though
Martin
took
her
arm
,
and
her
hand
too
,
and
they
paced
up
and
down
a
short
walk
that
was
least
exposed
to
observation
,
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
changed
at
all
,
my
love
,
since
we
parted
,
"
said
Martin
at
length
,
as
he
looked
upon
her
with
a
proud
delight
,
"
it
is
only
to
be
more
beautiful
than
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
Had
she
been
of
the
common
metal
of
love
-
worn
young
ladies
,
she
would
have
denied
this
in
her
most
interesting
manner
;
and
would
have
told
him
that
she
knew
she
had
become
a
perfect
fright
;
or
that
she
had
wasted
away
with
weeping
and
anxiety
;
or
that
she
was
dwindling
gently
into
an
early
grave
;
or
that
her
mental
sufferings
were
unspeakable
;
or
would
,
either
by
tears
or
words
,
or
a
mixture
of
both
,
have
furnished
him
with
some
other
information
to
that
effect
,
and
made
him
as
miserable
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
had
been
reared
up
in
a
sterner
school
than
the
minds
of
most
young
girls
are
formed
in
<EOS>
;
she
had
had
her
nature
strengthened
by
the
hands
of
hard
endurance
and
necessity
;
had
come
out
from
her
young
trials
constant
,
self
-
denying
,
earnest
,
and
devoted
;
had
acquired
in
her
maidenhood
---
whether
happily
in
the
end
,
for
herself
or
him
,
is
foreign
to
our
present
purpose
to
inquire
---
something
of
that
nobler
quality
of
gentle
hearts
which
is
developed
often
by
the
sorrows
and
struggles
of
matronly
years
,
but
often
by
their
lessons
only
.
<EOS>
Unspoiled
,
unpampered
in
her
joys
or
griefs
;
with
frank
and
full
,
and
deep
affection
for
the
object
of
her
early
love
;
she
saw
in
him
one
who
for
her
sake
was
an
outcast
from
his
home
and
fortune
,
and
she
had
no
more
idea
of
bestowing
that
love
upon
him
in
other
than
cheerful
and
sustaining
words
,
full
of
high
hope
and
grateful
trustfulness
,
than
she
had
of
being
unworthy
of
it
,
in
her
lightest
thought
or
deed
,
for
any
base
temptation
that
the
world
could
offer
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
change
is
there
in
YOU
,
Martin
,
"
she
replied
;
"
for
that
concerns
me
nearest
?
 
<EOS>
You
look
more
anxious
and
more
thoughtful
than
you
used
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
as
to
that
,
my
love
,
"
said
Martin
as
he
drew
her
waist
within
his
arm
,
first
looking
round
to
see
that
there
were
no
observers
near
,
and
beholding
Mr
Tapley
more
intent
than
ever
on
the
fog
;
"
it
would
be
strange
if
I
did
not
;
for
my
life
---
especially
of
late
---
has
been
a
hard
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
must
have
been
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
have
I
forgotten
to
think
of
it
and
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
often
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
often
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Not
often
,
I
have
some
right
to
expect
,
Mary
;
for
I
have
undergone
a
great
deal
of
vexation
and
privation
,
and
I
naturally
look
for
that
return
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
,
very
poor
return
<EOS>
,
"
she
answered
with
a
fainter
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
it
,
and
will
have
it
always
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
paid
a
dear
price
for
a
poor
heart
,
Martin
;
but
it
is
at
least
your
own
,
and
a
true
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
feel
quite
certain
of
that
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
or
I
should
n't
have
put
myself
in
my
present
position
.
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
say
a
poor
heart
,
Mary
,
<EOS>
for
I
say
a
rich
one
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
about
to
break
a
design
to
you
,
dearest
,
which
will
startle
you
at
first
,
but
which
is
undertaken
for
your
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
,
"
he
added
slowly
,
looking
far
into
the
deep
wonder
of
her
bright
dark
eyes
,
"
abroad
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Abroad
,
Martin
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
to
America
.
 
<EOS>
See
now
.
 
<EOS>
How
you
droop
directly
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
,
or
,
I
hope
I
may
say
,
if
I
did
,
"
she
answered
,
raising
her
head
after
a
short
silence
,
and
looking
once
more
into
his
face
,
"
it
was
for
grief
to
think
of
what
you
are
resolved
to
undergo
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
venture
to
dissuade
you
,
Martin
;
but
it
is
a
long
,
long
distance
;
there
is
a
wide
ocean
to
be
crossed
;
illness
and
want
are
sad
calamities
in
any
place
,
but
in
a
foreign
country
dreadful
to
endure
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
thought
of
all
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thought
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
abating
,
in
his
fondness
---
and
he
WAS
very
fond
of
her
---
hardly
an
iota
of
his
usual
impetuosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
well
to
say
,
"
Have
I
thought
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
my
love
;
but
you
should
ask
me
in
the
same
breath
,
have
I
thought
of
starving
at
home
;
have
I
thought
of
doing
porter
's
work
for
a
living
;
have
I
thought
of
holding
horses
in
the
streets
to
earn
my
roll
of
bread
from
day
to
day
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
gentler
tone
,
"
do
not
hang
down
your
head
,
my
dear
,
for
I
need
the
encouragement
that
your
sweet
face
alone
can
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
that
's
well
!
 
<EOS>
Now
you
are
brave
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
endeavouring
to
be
,
"
she
answered
,
smiling
through
her
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Endeavouring
to
be
anything
that
's
good
,
and
being
it
,
is
,
with
you
,
all
one
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
know
that
of
old
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Martin
,
gaily
.
"
<EOS>
So
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
famous
!
 
<EOS>
Now
I
can
tell
you
all
my
plans
as
cheerfully
as
if
you
were
my
little
wife
already
,
Mary
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
hung
more
closely
on
his
arm
,
and
looking
upwards
in
his
face
,
bade
him
speak
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
Martin
,
playing
with
the
little
hand
upon
his
wrist
,
"
that
my
attempts
to
advance
myself
at
home
have
been
baffled
and
rendered
abortive
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
by
whom
,
Mary
,
for
that
would
give
pain
to
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
But
so
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
him
speak
of
late
of
any
relative
of
mine
or
his
,
called
Pecksniff
?
 
<EOS>
Only
tell
me
what
I
ask
you
,
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
,
to
my
surprise
,
that
he
is
a
better
man
than
was
supposed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
,
"
interrupted
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
that
it
is
likely
we
may
come
to
know
him
,
if
not
to
visit
and
reside
with
him
and
---
I
think
---
his
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
He
HAS
daughters
,
has
he
,
love
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
pair
of
them
,
"
Martin
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
precious
pair
!
 
<EOS>
Gems
of
the
first
water
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
jesting
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
sort
of
jesting
which
is
very
much
in
earnest
,
and
includes
some
pretty
serious
disgust
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
jest
in
reference
to
Mr
Pecksniff
(
at
whose
house
I
have
been
living
as
his
assistant
,
and
at
whose
hands
I
have
received
insult
and
injury
)
,
in
that
vein
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
betides
,
or
however
closely
you
may
be
brought
into
communication
with
this
family
,
never
forget
that
,
Mary
;
and
never
for
an
instant
,
whatever
appearances
may
seem
to
contradict
me
,
lose
sight
of
this
assurance
---
Pecksniff
is
a
scoundrel
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
thought
,
and
in
deed
,
and
in
everything
else
.
 
<EOS>
A
scoundrel
from
the
topmost
hair
of
his
head
,
to
the
nethermost
atom
of
his
heel
.
<EOS>
Of
his
daughters
I
will
only
say
that
,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
,
they
are
dutiful
young
ladies
,
and
take
after
their
father
closely
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
digression
from
the
main
point
,
and
yet
it
brings
me
to
what
I
was
going
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
to
look
into
her
eyes
again
,
and
seeing
,
in
a
hasty
glance
over
his
shoulder
,
that
there
was
no
one
near
,
and
that
Mark
was
still
intent
upon
the
fog
,
not
only
looked
at
her
lips
,
too
,
but
kissed
them
into
the
bargain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
am
going
to
America
,
with
great
prospects
of
doing
well
,
and
of
returning
home
myself
very
soon
;
it
may
be
to
take
you
there
for
a
few
years
,
but
,
at
all
events
,
to
claim
you
for
my
wife
;
which
,
after
such
trials
,
I
should
do
with
no
fear
of
your
still
thinking
it
a
duty
to
cleave
to
him
who
will
not
suffer
me
to
live
(
for
this
is
true
)
,
if
he
can
help
it
,
in
my
own
land
.
 
<EOS>
How
long
I
may
be
absent
is
,
of
course
,
uncertain
;
but
it
shall
not
be
very
long
.
<EOS>
Trust
me
for
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
,
dear
Martin
---
"
   
"
That
's
the
very
thing
I
am
coming
to
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
you
shall
hear
,
constantly
,
of
all
my
goings
-
on
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
.
"
   
He
paused
to
take
from
his
pocket
the
letter
he
had
written
overnight
,
and
then
resumed
:
   
"
<EOS>
In
this
fellow
's
employment
,
and
living
in
this
fellow
's
house
(
by
fellow
,
I
mean
Mr
Pecksniff
,
of
course
)
,
there
is
a
certain
person
of
the
name
of
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
forget
;
a
poor
,
strange
,
simple
oddity
,
Mary
;
but
thoroughly
honest
and
sincere
;
full
of
zeal
;
and
with
a
cordial
regard
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Which
I
mean
to
return
one
of
these
days
,
by
setting
him
up
in
life
in
some
way
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
old
kind
nature
,
Martin
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Martin
,
"
that
's
not
worth
speaking
of
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
very
grateful
and
desirous
to
serve
me
;
and
I
am
more
than
repaid
.
<EOS>
Now
one
night
I
told
this
Pinch
my
history
,
and
all
about
myself
and
you
;
in
which
he
was
not
a
little
interested
,
I
can
tell
you
,
for
he
knows
you
!
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
you
may
look
surprised
---
and
the
longer
the
better
for
it
becomes
you
---
<EOS>
but
you
have
heard
him
play
the
organ
in
the
church
of
that
village
before
now
;
and
he
has
seen
you
listening
to
his
music
;
and
has
caught
his
inspiration
from
you
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
HE
the
organist
?
"
cried
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
him
from
my
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
was
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
and
is
,
and
gets
nothing
for
it
either
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
simple
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
Quite
an
infant
!
 
<EOS>
But
a
very
good
sort
of
creature
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
that
,
"
she
said
with
great
earnestness
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
no
doubt
at
all
about
it
,
"
rejoined
Martin
,
in
his
usual
careless
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
It
has
occurred
to
me
---
but
stay
.

If
I
read
you
what
I
have
written
and
intend
sending
to
him
by
post
to
-
night
<EOS>
it
will
explain
itself
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Tom
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
That
's
rather
familiar
perhaps
,
"
said
Martin
,
suddenly
remembering
that
he
was
proud
when
they
had
last
met
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
call
him
my
dear
Tom
Pinch
because
he
likes
it
,
and
it
pleases
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
right
,
and
very
kind
,
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
as
well
to
be
kind
whenever
one
can
;
and
,
as
I
said
before
,
he
really
is
an
excellent
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Tom
Pinch
---
I
address
this
under
cover
to
Mrs
Lupin
,
at
the
Blue
Dragon
,
and
have
begged
her
in
a
short
note
to
deliver
it
to
you
without
saying
anything
about
it
elsewhere
;
and
to
do
the
same
with
all
future
letters
she
may
receive
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
reason
for
so
doing
will
be
at
once
apparent
to
you
"
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
know
that
it
will
be
,
by
the
bye
,
"
said
Martin
,
breaking
off
,
"
for
he
's
slow
of
comprehension
,
poor
fellow
;
but
he
'll
find
it
out
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
My
reason
simply
is
,
that
I
do
n't
want
my
letters
to
be
read
by
other
people
;
and
particularly
by
the
scoundrel
whom
he
thinks
an
angel
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pecksniff
again
?
"
asked
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
same
,
"
said
Martin
"
---
will
be
at
once
apparent
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
completed
my
arrangements
for
going
to
America
;
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
I
am
to
be
accompanied
by
Mark
Tapley
,
upon
whom
I
have
stumbled
strangely
in
London
,
and
who
insists
on
putting
himself
under
my
protection

---
<EOS>
meaning
,
my
love
,
"
said
Martin
,
breaking
off
again
,
"
our
friend
in
the
rear
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
delighted
to
hear
this
,
and
bestowed
a
kind
glance
upon
Mark
,
which
he
brought
his
eyes
down
from
the
fog
to
encounter
and
received
with
immense
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
in
his
hearing
,
too
,
that
he
was
a
good
soul
and
a
merry
creature
,
and
would
be
faithful
,
she
was
certain
;
commendations
which
Mr
Tapley
inwardly
resolved
to
deserve
,
from
such
lips
,
if
he
died
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Now
,
my
dear
Pinch
,
"
"
resumed
Martin
,
proceeding
with
his
letter
;
"
"
I
am
going
to
repose
great
trust
in
you

knowing
that
I
may
do
so

perfect
reliance

your
honour

secrecy

having
nobody
else
just
now
to
trust
in

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
would
say
that

<EOS>
"
Would
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
that
out

<EOS>
It
's
perfectly
true

But
it
might
seem
ungracious
,
perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mind
Pinch

said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
occasion

stand
on
any
ceremony

I
'll
take
it
out

full
stop

secrecy

Very
well

shall
not
only

this

the

I
understand

I
shall
not
only
enclose
my
letters
to
the
young
lady
of
whom
I
have
told
you
,
to
your
charge
,
to
be
forwarded
as
she
may
request
;
but
I
most
earnestly
commit
her
,
the
young
lady
herself
,
to
your
care
and
regard
,
in
the
event
of
your
meeting
in
my
absence
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
think
that
the
probabilities
of
your
encountering
each
other
---
perhaps
very
frequently
---
are
now
neither
remote
nor
few
;
and
although
in
our
position
you
can
do
very
little
to
lessen
the
uneasiness
of
hers
,
I
trust
to
you
implicitly
to
do
that
much
,
and
so
deserve
the
confidence
I
have
reposed
in
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
my
dear
Mary
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
it
will
be
a
great
consolation
to
you
to
have
anybody
,
no
matter
how
simple
,
with
whom
you
can
speak
about
ME
;
and
the
very
first
time
you
talk
to
Pinch
<EOS>
,
you
'll
feel
at
once
that
there
is
no
more
occasion
for
any
embarrassment
or
hesitation
in
talking
to
him
,
than
if
he
were
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
However
that
may
be
,
"
she
returned
,
smiling
,
"
he
is
your
friend
,
and
that
is
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
he
's
my
friend
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
have
told
him
in
so
many
words
that
we
'll
always
take
notice
of
him
,
and
protect
him
;
and
it
's
a
good
trait
in
his
character
that
he
's
grateful
---
very
grateful
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
like
him
of
all
things
,
my
love
<EOS>
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
observe
very
much
that
's
comical
and
old
-
fashioned
about
Pinch
,
but
you
need
n't
mind
laughing
at
him
;
for
he
'll
not
care
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
rather
like
it
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
put
that
to
the
test
,
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
if
you
can
help
it
,
of
course
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
'll
find
him
a
little
too
much
for
your
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
that
's
neither
here
nor
there
,
and
it
certainly
is
not
the
letter
;
which
ends
thus
:
<EOS>
"
Knowing
that
I
need
not
impress
the
nature
and
extent
of
that
confidence
upon
you
at
any
greater
length
,
as
it
is
already
sufficiently
established
in
your
mind
,
I
will
only
say
,
in
bidding
you
farewell
and
looking
forward
to
our
next
meeting
,
that
I
shall
charge
myself
from
this
time
,
through
all
changes
for
the
better
,
with
your
advancement
and
happiness
,
as
if
they
were
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
rely
upon
that
.
 
<EOS>
And
always
believe
me
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Tom
Pinch
,
faithfully
your
friend
,
Martin
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
PS
.
<EOS>
---
I
enclose
the
amount
<EOS>
which
you
so
kindly
"
---
Oh
,
"
said
Martin
,
checking
himself
,
and
folding
up
the
letter
,
<EOS>
"
that
's
nothing
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
crisis
Mark
Tapley
interposed
,
with
an
apology
for
remarking
that
the
clock
at
the
Horse
Guards
was
striking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
I
should
n't
have
said
nothing
about
,
sir
,
"
added
Mark
,
"
if
the
young
lady
had
n't
begged
me
to
be
particular
in
mentioning
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
said
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
minute
I
shall
be
ready
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
time
for
a
very
few
words
more
,
dear
Martin
,
and
although
I
had
much
to
say
,
it
must
remain
unsaid
until
the
happy
time
of
our
next
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
send
it
may
come
speedily
and
prosperously
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
fear
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
who
has
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
a
few
months
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
a
whole
year
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
come
gaily
back
,
with
a
road
through
life
hewn
out
before
me
,
then
indeed
,
looking
back
upon
this
parting
,
it
may
seem
a
dismal
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
!
<EOS>
I
swear
I
would
n't
have
it
happen
under
more
favourable
auspices
,
if
I
could
;
for
then
I
should
be
less
inclined
to
go
,
and
less
impressed
with
the
necessity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
too
.
 
<EOS>
When
do
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
We
leave
for
Liverpool
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
A
vessel
sails
from
that
port
,
as
I
hear
,
in
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
month
,
or
less
,
we
shall
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
what
's
a
month
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
months
have
flown
by
,
since
our
last
parting
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Long
to
look
back
upon
,
"
said
Mary
,
echoing
his
cheerful
tone
,
"
but
nothing
in
their
course
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
change
of
scene
and
change
of
place
;
change
of
people
,
change
of
manners
,
change
of
cares
and
hopes
!
 
<EOS>
Time
will
wear
wings
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
bear
anything
,
so
that
I
have
swift
action
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Was
he
thinking
solely
of
her
care
for
him
,
when
he
took
so
little
heed
of
her
share
in
the
separation
;
of
her
quiet
monotonous
endurance
,
and
her
slow
anxiety
from
day
to
day
?
 
<EOS>
Was
there
nothing
jarring
and
discordant
even
in
his
tone
of
courage
,
with
this
one
note
"
self
"
for
ever
audible
,
however
high
the
strain
?
 
<EOS>
Not
in
her
ears
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
better
otherwise
,
perhaps
,
but
so
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
heard
the
same
bold
spirit
which
had
flung
away
as
dross
<EOS>
all
gain
and
profit
for
her
sake
,
making
light
of
peril
and
privation
that
she
might
be
calm
and
happy
;
and
<EOS>
she
heard
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
That
heart
where
self
has
found
no
place
and
raised
no
throne
,
is
slow
to
recognize
its
ugly
presence
when
it
looks
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
one
possessed
of
an
evil
spirit
was
held
in
old
time
to
be
alone
conscious
of
the
lurking
demon
in
the
breasts
of
other
men
,
so
kindred
vices
know
each
other
in
their
hiding
-
places
every
day
,
when
Virtue
is
incredulous
and
blind
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
quarter
's
gone
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Tapley
,
in
a
voice
of
admonition
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
ready
to
return
immediately
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
thing
,
dear
Martin
,
I
am
bound
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
entreated
me
a
few
minutes
since
only
to
answer
what
you
asked
me
in
reference
to
one
theme
,
but
you
should
and
must
know
(
otherwise
I
could
not
be
at
ease
)
that
since
that
separation
of
which
I
was
the
unhappy
occasion
,
he
has
never
once
uttered
your
name
;
has
never
coupled
it
,
or
any
faint
allusion
to
it
,
with
passion
or
reproach
;
and
has
never
abated
in
his
kindness
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
him
for
that
last
act
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
and
for
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
Though
on
consideration
I
may
thank
him
for
his
other
forbearance
also
,
inasmuch
as
I
neither
expect
nor
desire
that
he
will
mention
my
name
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
once
,
perhaps
---
to
couple
it
with
reproach
---
in
his
will
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
,
if
he
please
!
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
it
reaches
me
,
he
will
be
in
his
grave
;
a
satire
on
his
own
anger
,
God
help
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Martin
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
would
but
sometimes
,
in
some
quiet
hour
;
beside
the
winter
fire
;
in
the
summer
air
;
when
you
hear
gentle
music
,
or
think
of
Death
,
or
Home
,
or
Childhood
;
if
you
would
at
such
a
season
resolve
to
think
,
but
once
a
month
,
or
even
once
a
year
,
of
him
,
or
any
one
who
ever
wronged
you
,
you
would
forgive
him
in
your
heart
,
I
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
believed
that
to
be
true
,
Mary
,
"
he
replied
,
"
I
would
resolve
at
no
such
time
to
bear
him
in
my
mind
;
wishing
to
spare
myself
the
shame
of
such
a
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
born
to
be
the
toy
and
puppet
of
any
man
,
far
less
his
;
to
whose
pleasure
and
caprice
,
in
return
for
any
good
<EOS>
he
did
me
,
my
whole
youth
was
sacrificed
.
 
<EOS>
It
became
between
us
two
a
fair
exchange
---
a
barter
---
and
no
more
;
and
there
is
no
such
balance
against
me
that
I
need
throw
in
a
mawkish
forgiveness
to
poise
the
scale
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
forbidden
all
mention
of
me
to
you
,
I
know
,
"
he
added
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Has
he
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
long
ago
,
"
she
returned
;
"
immediately
after
your
parting
;
before
you
had
left
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
never
done
so
since
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
done
so
since
because
he
has
seen
no
occasion
,
"
said
Martin
;
"
but
that
is
of
little
consequence
,
one
way
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
Let
all
allusion
to
him
between
you
and
me
be
interdicted
from
this
time
forth
.
 
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
love
"
---
he
drew
her
quickly
to
him
,
for
the
time
of
parting
had
now
come
---
"
in
the
first
letter
that
you
write
to
me
through
the
Post
Office
,
addressed
to
New
York
;
and
in
all
the
others
that
you
send
through
Pinch
;
remember
he
has
no
existence
,
but
has
become
to
us
as
one
who
is
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
God
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
strange
place
for
such
a
meeting
and
such
a
parting
;
but
our
next
meeting
shall
be
in
a
better
,
and
our
next
and
last
parting
in
a
worse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
other
question
,
Martin
<EOS>
,
I
must
ask
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
provided
money
for
this
journey
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
<EOS>
;
it
might
have
been
in
his
pride
;
it
might
have
been
in
his
desire
to
set
her
mind
at
ease
:
"
Have
I
provided
money
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
there
's
a
question
for
an
emigrant
's
wife
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
move
on
land
or
sea
without
it
,
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
 
<EOS>
More
than
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
times
more
than
enough
.
 
<EOS>
A
pocket
-
full
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
and
I
,
for
all
essential
ends
,
are
quite
as
rich
as
if
we
had
the
purse
of
Fortunatus
in
our
baggage
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
half
-
hour
's
a
-
going
!
"
cried
Mr
Tapley
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
a
hundred
times
!
"
cried
Mary
,
in
a
trembling
voice
.
   
<EOS>
But
how
cold
the
comfort
in
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
 
<EOS>
Mark
Tapley
knew
it
perfectly
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
knew
it
from
his
reading
,
perhaps
from
his
experience
,
perhaps
from
intuition
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
say
;
but
however
he
knew
it
,
his
knowledge
instinctively
suggested
to
him
the
wisest
course
of
proceeding
that
any
man
could
have
adopted
under
the
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taken
with
a
violent
fit
of
sneezing
,
and
was
obliged
to
turn
his
head
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
In
doing
which
,
he
,
in
a
manner
fenced
and
screened
the
lovers
into
a
corner
by
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
pause
,
but
Mark
had
an
undefined
sensation
that
it
was
a
satisfactory
one
in
its
way
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mary
,
with
her
veil
lowered
,
passed
him
with
a
quick
step
,
and
beckoned
him
to
follow
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
once
more
before
they
lost
that
corner
;
looked
back
;
and
waved
her
hand
to
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
start
towards
them
at
the
moment
as
if
he
had
some
other
farewell
words
to
say
;
but
she
only
hurried
off
the
faster
,
and
Mr
Tapley
followed
as
in
duty
bound
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
rejoined
Martin
again
in
his
own
chamber
,
he
found
that
gentleman
seated
moodily
before
the
dusty
grate
,
with
his
two
feet
on
the
fender
,
his
two
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
his
chin
supported
,
in
a
not
very
ornamental
manner
,
on
the
palms
of
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mark
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
taking
a
long
breath
,
"
I
see
the
young
lady
safe
home
,
and
I
feel
pretty
comfortable
after
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
sent
a
lot
of
kind
words
,
sir
,
and
this
,
"
handing
him
a
ring
,
"
for
a
parting
keepsake
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Diamonds
!
"
said
Martin
,
kissing
it
---
let
us
do
him
justice
,
it
was
for
her
sake
;
not
for
theirs
---
and
putting
it
on
his
little
finger
.
"
<EOS>
Splendid
diamonds
!
 
<EOS>
My
grandfather
is
a
singular
character
,
Mark
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
given
her
this
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
Tapley
knew
as
well
that
she
had
bought
it
,
to
the
end
that
that
unconscious
speaker
might
carry
some
article
of
sterling
value
with
him
in
his
necessity
;
as
he
knew
that
it
was
day
,
and
not
night
.
 
<EOS>
Though
he
had
no
more
acquaintance
of
his
own
knowledge
with
the
history
of
the
glittering
trinket
on
Martin
's
outspread
finger
,
than
Martin
himself
had
,
he
was
as
certain
that
in
its
purchase
she
had
expended
her
whole
stock
of
hoarded
money
,
as
if
he
had
seen
it
paid
down
coin
by
coin
.
 
<EOS>
Her
lover
's
strange
obtuseness
in
relation
to
this
little
incident
,
promptly
suggested
to
Mark
's
mind
its
real
cause
and
root
;
and
from
that
moment
he
had
a
clear
and
perfect
insight
into
the
one
absorbing
principle
of
Martin
's
character
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
worthy
of
the
sacrifices
I
have
made
,
"
said
Martin
,
folding
his
arms
,
and
looking
at
the
ashes
in
the
stove
,
as
if
in
resumption
of
some
former
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
worthy
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
No
riches
"
<EOS>
---
here
he
stroked
his
chin
and
mused
---
"
could
have
compensated
for
the
loss
of
such
a
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
mention
that
in
gaining
her
affection
I
have
followed
the
bent
of
my
own
wishes
,
and
baulked
the
selfish
schemes
of
others
who
had
no
right
to
form
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
quite
worthy
---
more
than
worthy
---
of
the
sacrifices
I
have
made
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
ruminations
might
or
might
not
have
reached
Mark
Tapley
;
for
though
they
were
by
no
means
addressed
to
him
,
yet
they
were
softly
uttered
.
 
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
he
stood
there
,
watching
Martin
with
an
indescribable
and
most
involved
expression
on
his
visage
,
until
that
young
man
roused
himself
and
looked
towards
him
;
when
he
turned
away
,
as
being
suddenly
intent
upon
certain
preparations
for
the
journey
,
and
,
without
giving
vent
to
any
articulate
sound
,
smiled
with
surpassing
ghastliness
,
and
seemed
by
a
twist
of
his
features
and
a
motion
of
his
lips
,
to
release
himself
of
this
word
:
   
"
Jolly

The

Columbia

<EOS>
A
dark
and
dreary
night
;
people
nestling
in
their
beds
or
circling
late
about
the
fire
;
Want
,
colder
than
Charity
,
shivering
at
the
street
corners
;
church
-
towers
humming
with
the
faint
vibration
of
their
own
tongues
,
but
newly
resting
from
the
ghostly
preachment
"
One
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
earth
covered
with
a
sable
pall
as
for
the
burial
of
yesterday
;
the
clumps
of
dark
trees
,
its
giant
plumes
of
funeral
feathers
,
waving
sadly
to
and
fro
:
all
hushed
,
all
noiseless
,
and
in
deep
repose
,
save
the
swift
clouds
that
skim
across
the
moon
,
and
the
cautious
wind
,
as
,
creeping
after
them
upon
the
ground
,
it
stops
to
listen
,
and
goes
rustling
on
,
and
stops
again
,
and
follows
,
like
a
savage
on
the
trail
.
   
<EOS>
Whither
go
the
clouds
and
wind
so
eagerly
?
 
<EOS>
If
,
like
guilty
spirits
,
they
repair
to
some
dread
conference
with
powers
like
themselves
,
in
what
wild
regions
do
the
elements
hold
council
,
or
where
unbend
in
terrible
disport
?
   
<EOS>
Here
!
 
<EOS>
Free
from
that
cramped
prison
called
the
earth
,
and
out
upon
the
waste
of
waters
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
roaring
,
raging
,
shrieking
,
howling
,
all
night
long
.
 
<EOS>
Hither
come
the
sounding
voices
from
the
caverns
on
the
coast
of
that
small
island
,
sleeping
,
a
thousand
miles
away
,
so
quietly
in
the
midst
of
angry
waves
;
and
hither
,
to
meet
them
,
rush
the
blasts
from
unknown
desert
places
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
in
the
fury
of
their
unchecked
liberty
,
they
storm
and
buffet
with
each
other
,
until
the
sea
,
lashed
into
passion
like
their
own
,
leaps
up
,
in
ravings
mightier
than
theirs
,
and
the
whole
scene
is
madness
.
   
<EOS>
On
,
on
,
on
,
over
the
countless
miles
of
angry
space
roll
the
long
heaving
billows
.
 
<EOS>
Mountains
and
caves
are
here
,
and
yet
are
not
;
for
what
is
now
the
one
,
is
now
the
other
;
then
all
is
but
a
boiling
heap
of
rushing
water
.
 
<EOS>
Pursuit
,
and
flight
,
and
mad
return
of
wave
on
wave
,
and
savage
struggle
,
ending
in
a
spouting
-
up
of
foam
that
whitens
the
black
night
;
incessant
change
of
place
,
and
form
,
and
hue
;
constancy
in
nothing
,
but
eternal
strife
;
on
,
on
,
on
,
they
roll
,
and
darker
grows
the
night
,
and
louder
howls
the
wind
,
and
more
clamorous
and
fierce
become
the
million
voices
in
the
sea
,
when
the
wild
cry
goes
forth
upon
the
storm
"
A
ship
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Onward
she
comes
,
in
gallant
combat
with
the
elements
,
her
tall
masts
trembling
,
and
her
timbers
starting
on
the
strain
;
onward
she
comes
,
now
high
upon
the
curling
billows
,
now
low
down
in
the
hollows
of
the
sea
,
as
hiding
for
the
moment
from
its
fury
;
and
every
storm
-
voice
in
the
air
and
water
cries
more
loudly
yet
,
"
A
ship
!
"
   
<EOS>
Still
she
comes
striving
on
;
and
at
her
boldness
and
the
spreading
cry
,
the
angry
waves
rise
up
above
each
other
's
hoary
heads
to
look
;
and
round
about
the
vessel
,
far
as
the
mariners
on
the
decks
can
pierce
into
the
gloom
,
they
press
upon
her
,
forcing
each
other
down
and
starting
up
,
and
rushing
forward
from
afar
,
in
dreadful
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
High
over
her
they
break
;
and
round
her
surge
and
roar
;
and
giving
place
to
others
,
moaningly
depart
,
and
dash
themselves
to
fragments
in
their
baffled
anger
.
 
<EOS>
Still
she
comes
onward
bravely
.
<EOS>
And
though
the
eager
multitude
crowd
thick
and
fast
upon
her
all
the
night
,
and
dawn
of
day
discovers
the
untiring
train
yet
bearing
down
upon
the
ship
in
an
eternity
of
troubled
water
,
onward
she
comes
,
with
dim
lights
burning
in
her
hull
,
and
people
there
,
asleep
;
as
if
no
deadly
element
were
peering
in
at
every
seam
and
chink
,
and
no
drowned
seaman
's
grave
,
with
but
a
plank
to
cover
it
,
were
yawning
in
the
unfathomable
depths
below
.
   
<EOS>
Among
these
sleeping
voyagers
were
Martin
and
Mark
Tapley
,
who
,
rocked
into
a
heavy
drowsiness
by
the
unaccustomed
motion
,
were
as
insensible
to
the
foul
air
in
which
they
lay
,
as
to
the
uproar
without
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
broad
day
when
the
latter
awoke
with
a
dim
idea
that
he
was
dreaming
of
having
gone
to
sleep
in
a
four
-
post
bedstead
which
had
turned
bottom
upwards
in
the
course
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
more
reason
in
this
too
,
than
in
the
roasting
of
eggs
;
for
the
first
objects
Mr
Tapley
recognized
when
he
opened
his
eyes
were
his
own
heels
---
looking
down
to
him
,
as
he
afterwards
observed
,
from
a
nearly
perpendicular
elevation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mark
,
getting
himself
into
a
sitting
posture
,
after
various
ineffectual
struggles
with
the
rolling
of
the
ship
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
first
time
as
ever
I
stood
on
my
head
all
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
n't
go
to
sleep
upon
the
ground
with
your
head
to
leeward
then
,
"
growled
a
man
in
one
of
the
berths
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
my
head
to
WHERE
?
"
asked
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
repeated
his
previous
sentiment
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
wo
n't
another
time
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
when
I
know
whereabouts
on
the
map
that
country
is
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
I
can
give
you
a
better
piece
of
advice
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
nor
any
other
friend
of
mine
never
go
to
sleep
with
his
head
in
a
ship
any
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
gave
a
grunt
of
discontented
acquiescence
,
turned
over
in
his
berth
,
and
drew
his
blanket
over
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
For
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
pursuing
the
theme
by
way
of
soliloquy
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
;
"
the
sea
is
as
nonsensical
a
thing
as
any
going
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
knows
what
to
do
with
itself
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
n't
got
no
employment
for
its
mind
,
and
is
always
in
a
state
of
vacancy
.
 
<EOS>
Like
them
<EOS>
Polar
bears
in
the
wild
-
beast
shows
as
is
constantly
a
-
nodding
their
heads
from
side
to
side
<EOS>
,
it
never
CAN
be
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Which
is
entirely
owing
to
its
uncommon
stupidity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
you
,
Mark
?
"
asked
a
faint
voice
from
another
berth
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
as
much
of
me
as
is
left
,
<EOS>
sir
,
after
a
fortnight
of
this
work
,
"
Mr
Tapley
replied
,
"
What
with
leading
the
life
of
a
fly
,
ever
since
I
've
been
aboard
---
for
I
've
been
perpetually
holding
-
on
to
something
or
other
in
a
upside
-
down
position
---
<EOS>
what
with
that
,
sir
,
and
putting
a
very
little
into
myself
,
and
taking
a
good
deal
out
of
myself
,
there
an't
too
much
of
me
to
swear
by
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
find
yourself
this
morning
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
miserable
,
"
said
Martin
,
with
a
peevish
groan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ugh
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
wretched
,
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Creditable
,
"
muttered
Mark
,
pressing
one
hand
upon
his
aching
head
and
looking
round
him
with
a
rueful
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
great
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
It
IS
creditable
to
keep
up
one
's
spirits
here
.
 
<EOS>
Virtue
's
its
own
reward
.
 
<EOS>
So
's
jollity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
was
so
far
right
that
unquestionably
any
man
who
retained
his
cheerfulness
among
the
steerage
accommodations
of
that
noble
and
fast
-
sailing
line
-
of
-
packet
ship
,
"
THE
SCREW
,
"
was
solely
indebted
to
his
own
resources
,
and
shipped
his
good
humour
,
like
his
provisions
,
without
any
contribution
or
assistance
from
the
owners
.
<EOS>
A
dark
,
low
,
stifling
cabin
,
surrounded
by
berths
all
filled
to
overflowing
with
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
in
various
stages
of
sickness
and
misery
,
is
not
the
liveliest
place
of
assembly
at
any
time
;
but
when
it
is
so
crowded
(
as
the
steerage
cabin
of
the
Screw
was
,
every
passage
out
)
,
<EOS>
that
mattresses
and
beds
are
heaped
upon
the
floor
,
to
the
extinction
of
everything
like
comfort
,
cleanliness
,
and
decency
,
it
is
liable
to
operate
not
only
as
a
pretty
strong
banner
against
amiability
of
temper
,
but
as
a
positive
encourager
of
selfish
and
rough
humours
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
felt
this
,
as
he
sat
looking
about
him
;
and
his
spirits
rose
proportionately
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
English
people
,
Irish
people
,
Welsh
people
,
and
Scotch
people
there
;
all
with
their
little
store
of
coarse
food
and
shabby
clothes
;
and
nearly
all
with
their
families
of
children
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
children
of
all
ages
;
from
the
baby
at
the
breast
,
to
the
slattern
-
girl
who
was
as
much
a
grown
woman
as
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Every
kind
of
domestic
suffering
that
is
bred
in
poverty
,
illness
,
banishment
,
sorrow
,
and
long
travel
in
bad
weather
,
was
crammed
into
the
little
space
;
and
yet
was
there
infinitely
less
of
complaint
and
querulousness
,
and
infinitely
more
of
mutual
assistance
and
general
kindness
to
be
found
in
that
unwholesome
ark
,
than
in
many
brilliant
ballrooms
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
looked
about
him
wistfully
,
and
his
face
brightened
as
he
looked
.
 
<EOS>
Here
an
old
grandmother
was
crooning
over
a
sick
child
,
and
rocking
it
to
and
fro
,
in
arms
hardly
more
wasted
than
its
own
young
limbs
;
here
a
poor
woman
with
an
infant
in
her
lap
,
mended
another
little
creature
's
clothes
,
and
quieted
another
who
was
creeping
up
about
her
from
their
scanty
bed
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Here
were
old
men
awkwardly
engaged
in
little
household
offices
,
wherein
they
would
have
been
ridiculous
but
for
their
good
-
will
and
kind
purpose
;
and
here
were
swarthy
fellows
---
giants
in
their
way
---
doing
such
little
acts
of
tenderness
for
those
about
them
,
as
might
have
belonged
to
gentlest
-
hearted
dwarfs
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
idiot
in
the
corner
who
sat
mowing
there
,
all
day
,
had
his
faculty
of
imitation
roused
by
what
he
saw
about
him
;
and
snapped
his
fingers
to
amuse
a
crying
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
"
said
Mark
,
nodding
to
a
woman
who
was
dressing
her
three
children
at
no
great
distance
from
him
---
and
<EOS>
the
grin
upon
his
face
had
by
this
time
spread
from
ear
to
ear
<EOS>
---
"
Hand
over
one
of
them
<EOS>
young
'
uns
<EOS>
according
to
custom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
get
breakfast
,
Mark
,
instead
of
worrying
with
people
who
do
n't
belong
to
you
,
"
observed
Martin
,
petulantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
SHE'll
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
fair
division
of
labour
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
wash
her
boys
,
and
she
makes
our
tea
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
COULD
make
tea
,
but
any
one
can
wash
a
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
woman
,
who
was
delicate
and
ill
,
felt
and
understood
his
kindness
,
as
well
she
might
,
for
she
had
been
covered
every
night
with
his
greatcoat
,
while
he
had
for
his
own
bed
the
bare
boards
and
a
rug
.
 
<EOS>
But
Martin
,
who
seldom
got
up
or
looked
about
him
,
was
quite
incensed
by
the
folly
of
this
speech
,
and
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
by
an
impatient
groan
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
it
is
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mark
,
brushing
the
child
's
hair
as
coolly
as
if
he
had
been
born
and
bred
a
barber
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
talking
about
,
now
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
you
said
,
"
replied
Mark
;
"
or
what
you
meant
,
when
you
gave
that
there
dismal
vent
to
your
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
I
quite
go
along
with
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
IS
very
hard
upon
her
.
"

What
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Making
the
voyage
by
herself
along
with
these
young
impediments
here
,
and
going
such
a
way
at
such
a
time
of
the
year
to
join
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
want
to
be
driven
mad
with
yellow
soap
in
your
eye
,
young
man
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
to
the
second
urchin
,
who
was
by
this
time
under
his
hands
at
the
basin
,
"
you
'd
better
shut
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
does
she
join
her
husband
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Martin
,
yawning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
'm
very
much
afraid
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
that
she
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
may
n't
miss
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
sent
her
last
letter
by
hand
,
and
it
do
n't
seem
to
have
been
very
clearly
understood
between
'em
without
it
,
and
if
she
do
n't
see
him
a
-
waving
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
on
the
shore
,
like
a
pictur
out
of
a
song
-
book
,
my
opinion
is
,
she
'll
break
her
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
,
in
Folly
's
name
,
does
the
woman
come
to
be
on
board
ship
on
such
a
wild
-
goose
venture
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
glanced
at
him
for
a
moment
as
he
lay
prostrate
in
his
berth
,
and
then
said
,
very
quietly
:
   
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
How
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
been
away
from
her
for
two
year
;
she
's
been
very
poor
and
lonely
in
her
own
country
;
and
has
always
been
a
-
looking
forward
to
meeting
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
strange
<EOS>
she
should
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
amazing
!
 
<EOS>
A
little
mad
perhaps
!
 
<EOS>
There
ca
n't
be
no
other
way
of
accounting
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
was
too
far
gone
in
the
lassitude
of
sea
-
sickness
to
make
any
reply
to
these
words
,
or
even
to
attend
to
them
as
they
were
spoken
.
<EOS>
And
the
subject
of
their
discourse
returning
at
this
crisis
with
some
hot
tea
,
effectually
put
a
stop
to
any
resumption
of
the
theme
by
Mr
Tapley
;
who
,
when
the
meal
was
over
and
he
had
adjusted
Martin
's
bed
,
went
up
on
deck
to
wash
the
breakfast
service
,
which
consisted
of
two
half
-
pint
tin
mugs
,
and
a
shaving
-
pot
of
the
same
metal
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
due
to
Mark
Tapley
to
state
that
he
suffered
at
least
as
much
from
sea
-
sickness
as
any
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
on
board
;
and
that
he
had
a
peculiar
faculty
of
knocking
himself
about
on
the
smallest
provocation
,
and
losing
his
legs
at
every
lurch
of
the
ship
.
 
<EOS>
But
resolved
,
in
his
usual
phrase
,
to
"
come
out
strong
"
under
disadvantageous
circumstances
,
he
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
steerage
,
and
made
no
more
of
stopping
in
the
middle
of
a
facetious
conversation
to
go
away
and
be
excessively
ill
by
himself
,
and
afterwards
come
back
in
the
very
best
and
gayest
of
tempers
to
resume
it
,
than
if
such
a
course
of
proceeding
had
been
the
commonest
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
said
that
as
his
illness
wore
off
,
his
cheerfulness
and
good
nature
increased
,
because
they
would
hardly
admit
of
augmentation
;
but
his
usefulness
among
the
weaker
members
of
the
party
was
much
enlarged
;
and
at
all
times
and
seasons
there
he
was
exerting
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
gleam
of
sun
shone
out
of
the
dark
sky
,
down
Mark
tumbled
into
the
cabin
,
and
presently
up
<EOS>
he
came
again
with
a
woman
in
his
arms
,
or
half
-
a
-
dozen
children
,
or
a
man
,
or
a
bed
,
or
a
saucepan
,
or
a
basket
,
or
something
animate
or
inanimate
,
that
he
thought
would
be
the
better
for
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
If
an
hour
or
two
of
fine
weather
in
the
middle
of
the
day
tempted
those
who
seldom
or
never
came
on
deck
at
other
times
to
crawl
into
the
long
-
boat
,
or
lie
down
upon
the
spare
spars
,
and
try
to
eat
,
there
,
in
the
centre
of
the
group
,
was
Mr
Tapley
,
handing
about
salt
beef
and
biscuit
,
or
dispensing
tastes
of
grog
,
or
cutting
up
the
children
's
provisions
with
his
pocketknife
,
for
their
greater
ease
and
comfort
,
or
reading
aloud
from
a
venerable
newspaper
,
or
singing
some
roaring
old
song
to
a
select
party
,
or
writing
the
beginnings
of
letters
to
their
friends
at
home
for
people
who
could
n't
write
,
or
cracking
jokes
with
the
crew
,
or
nearly
getting
blown
over
the
side
,
or
emerging
,
half
-
drowned
,
from
a
shower
of
spray
,
or
lending
a
hand
somewhere
or
other
;
but
always
doing
something
for
the
general
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
,
when
the
cooking
-
fire
was
lighted
on
the
deck
,
and
the
driving
sparks
that
flew
among
the
rigging
,
and
the
clouds
of
sails
,
seemed
to
menace
the
ship
with
certain
annihilation
by
fire
,
in
case
the
elements
of
air
and
water
failed
to
compass
her
destruction
;
there
,
again
,
was
Mr
Tapley
,
with
his
coat
off
and
his
shirt
-
sleeves
turned
up
to
his
elbows
,
doing
all
kinds
of
culinary
offices
;
compounding
the
strangest
dishes
;
recognized
by
every
one
as
an
established
authority
;
and
helping
all
parties
to
achieve
something
which
,
left
to
themselves
,
they
never
could
have
done
,
and
never
would
have
dreamed
of
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
there
never
was
a
more
popular
character
than
Mark
Tapley
became
,
on
board
<EOS>
that
noble
and
fast
-
sailing
line
-
of
-
packet
ship
,
the
Screw
;
and
he
attained
at
last
to
such
a
pitch
of
universal
admiration
,
that
he
began
to
have
grave
doubts
within
himself
whether
a
man
might
reasonably
claim
any
credit
for
being
jolly
under
such
exciting
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
this
was
going
to
last
,
"
said
Tapley
,
"
there
'd
be
no
great
difference
as
I
can
perceive
,
between
the
Screw
and
the
Dragon
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
am
to
get
credit
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
afraid
that
the
Fates
is
determined
to
make
the
world
easy
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mark
,
"
said
Martin
,
near
whose
berth
he
had
ruminated
to
this
effect
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
will
this
be
over
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Another
week
,
they
say
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
,
"
will
most
likely
bring
us
into
port
.
 
<EOS>
The
ship
's
a
-
going
along
at
present
,
as
sensible
as
a
ship
can
,
sir
;
though
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
as
that
's
any
very
high
praise
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
is
,
indeed
,
"
groaned
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
feel
all
the
better
for
it
,
sir
,
if
you
was
to
turn
out
,
"
observed
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
be
seen
by
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
on
the
after
-
deck
,
"
returned
Martin
,
with
a
scronful
emphasis
upon
the
words
,
"
mingling
with
the
beggarly
crowd
that
are
stowed
away
in
this
vile
hole
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
greatly
the
better
for
that
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
thankful
that
I
ca
n't
say
from
my
own
experience
what
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
may
be
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
thought
,
sir
,
as
a
gentleman
would
feel
a
deal
more
uncomfortable
down
here
than
up
in
the
fresh
air
,
especially
when
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
after
-
cabin
know
just
as
much
about
him
as
he
does
about
them
,
and
are
likely
to
trouble
their
heads
about
him
in
the
same
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
that
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Martin
,
"
you
would
have
thought
wrong
,
and
do
think
wrong
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
with
imperturbable
good
temper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
often
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
to
lying
here
,
"
cried
Martin
,
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
,
and
looking
angrily
at
his
follower
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
it
's
a
pleasure
to
lie
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
the
madhouses
in
the
world
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
"
could
n't
produce
such
a
maniac
as
the
man
must
be
who
could
think
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
are
you
forever
goading
and
urging
me
to
get
up
?
"
asked
Martin
,
"
I
lie
here
because
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
recognized
,
in
the
better
days
to
which
I
aspire
,
by
any
purse
-
proud
citizen
,
as
the
man
who
came
over
with
him
among
the
steerage
passengers
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
here
because
I
wish
to
conceal
my
circumstances
and
myself
,
and
not
to
arrive
in
a
new
world
badged
and
ticketed
as
an
utterly
poverty
-
stricken
man
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
afforded
a
passage
in
the
after
-
cabin
<EOS>
I
should
have
held
up
my
head
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
could
n't
I
hide
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
you
took
it
so
much
to
heart
as
this
comes
to
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
did
n't
know
,
"
returned
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
should
you
know
,
unless
I
told
you
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
trial
to
you
,
Mark
,
to
make
yourself
comfortable
and
to
bustle
about
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
as
natural
for
you
to
do
so
under
the
circumstances
as
it
is
for
me
not
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
do
n't
suppose
there
is
a
living
creature
in
this
ship
who
can
by
possibility
have
half
so
much
to
undergo
on
board
of
her
as
I
have
?
<EOS>
Do
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
sitting
upright
in
his
berth
and
looking
at
Mark
,
with
an
expression
of
great
earnestness
not
unmixed
with
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
twisted
his
face
into
a
tight
knot
,
and
with
his
head
very
much
on
one
side
,
pondered
upon
this
question
as
if
he
felt
it
an
extremely
difficult
one
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
relieved
from
his
embarrassment
by
Martin
himself
,
who
said
,
as
he
stretched
himself
upon
his
back
again
and
resumed
the
book
he
had
been
reading
:
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
the
use
of
my
putting
such
a
case
to
you
,
when
the
very
essence
of
what
I
have
been
saying
is
,
that
you
can
not
by
possibility
understand
it
!
 
<EOS>
Make
me
a
little
brandy
-
and
-
water
---
cold
and
very
weak
---
and
give
me
a
biscuit
,
and
tell
your
friend
,
who
is
a
nearer
neighbour
of
ours
than
I
could
wish
,
to
try
and
keep
her
children
a
little
quieter
to
-
night
than
she
did
last
night
;
that
's
a
good
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
set
himself
to
obey
these
orders
with
great
alacrity
,
and
pending
their
execution
,
it
may
be
presumed
his
flagging
spirits
revived
;
inasmuch
as
he
several
times
observed
,
below
his
breath
,
that
in
respect
of
its
power
of
imparting
a
credit
to
jollity
,
the
Screw
unquestionably
had
some
decided
advantages
over
the
Dragon
.
<EOS>
He
also
remarked
that
it
was
a
high
gratification
to
him
to
reflect
that
he
would
carry
its
main
excellence
ashore
with
him
,
and
have
it
constantly
beside
him
wherever
he
went
;
but
what
he
meant
by
these
consolatory
thoughts
he
did
not
explain
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
a
general
excitement
began
to
prevail
on
board
;
and
various
predictions
relative
to
the
precise
day
,
and
even
the
precise
hour
at
which
they
would
reach
New
York
,
were
freely
broached
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
infinitely
more
crowding
on
deck
and
looking
over
the
ship
's
side
than
there
had
been
before
;
and
an
epidemic
broke
out
for
packing
up
things
every
morning
,
which
required
unpacking
again
every
night
.
<EOS>
Those
who
had
any
letters
to
deliver
,
or
any
friends
to
meet
,
or
any
settled
plans
of
going
anywhere
or
doing
anything
,
discussed
their
prospects
a
hundred
times
a
day
;
and
as
this
class
of
passengers
was
very
small
,
and
the
number
of
those
who
had
no
prospects
whatever
was
very
large
,
there
were
plenty
of
listeners
and
few
talkers
.
<EOS>
Those
who
had
been
ill
all
along
,
got
well
now
,
and
those
who
had
been
well
,
got
better
.
 
<EOS>
An
American
gentleman
in
the
after
-
cabin
,
who
had
been
wrapped
up
in
fur
and
oilskin
the
whole
passage
,
unexpectedly
appeared
in
a
very
shiny
,
tall
,
black
hat
,
and
constantly
overhauled
a
very
little
valise
of
pale
leather
,
which
contained
his
clothes
,
linen
,
brushes
,
shaving
apparatus
,
books
,
trinkets
,
and
other
baggage
.
 
<EOS>
He
likewise
stuck
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
,
and
walked
the
deck
with
his
nostrils
dilated
,
as
already
inhaling
the
air
of
Freedom
which
carries
death
to
all
tyrants
,
and
can
never
(
under
any
circumstances
worth
mentioning
)
be
breathed
by
slaves
.
 
<EOS>
An
English
gentleman
who
was
strongly
suspected
of
having
run
away
from
a
bank
,
with
something
in
his
possession
belonging
to
its
strong
box
besides
the
key
,
grew
eloquent
upon
the
subject
of
the
rights
of
man
,
and
hummed
the
Marseillaise
Hymn
constantly
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
one
great
sensation
pervaded
the
whole
ship
,
and
the
soil
of
America
lay
close
before
them
;
so
close
at
last
,
that
,
upon
a
certain
starlight
night
they
took
a
pilot
on
board
,
and
within
a
few
hours
afterwards
lay
to
until
the
morning
,
awaiting
the
arrival
of
a
steamboat
in
which
the
passengers
were
to
be
conveyed
ashore
.
   
<EOS>
Off
she
came
,
soon
after
it
was
light
next
morning
,
and
lying
alongside
an
hour
or
more
---
during
which
period
her

The

of
those
transactions
 
<EOS>
Some
trifling
excitement
prevailed
upon
the
very
brink
and
margin
of
the
land
of
liberty
;
for
an
alderman
had
been
elected
the
day
before
;
and
Party
Feeling
naturally
running
rather
high
on
such
an
exciting
occasion
,
the
friends
of
the
disappointed
candidate
had
found
it
necessary
to
assert
the
great
principles
of
Purity
of
Election
and
Freedom
of
opinion
by
breaking
a
few
legs
and
arms
,
and
furthermore
pursuing
one
obnoxious
gentleman
through
the
streets
with
the
design
of
hitting
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
These
good
-
humoured
little
outbursts
of
the
popular
fancy
were
not
in
themselves
sufficiently
remarkable
to
create
any
great
stir
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
whole
night
;
but
they
found
fresh
life
and
notoriety
in
the
breath
of
the
newsboys
,
who
not
only
proclaimed
them
with
shrill
yells
in
all
the
highways
and
byways
of
the
town
,
upon
the
wharves
and
among
the
shipping
,
but
on
the
deck
and
down
in
the
cabins
of
the
steamboat
;
which
,
before
she
touched
the
shore
,
was
boarded
and
overrun
by
a
legion
of
those
young
citizens

"
It
is
in
such
enlightened
means
,
"
said
a
voice
almost
in
Martin
's
ear
,
"
that
the
bubbling
passions
of
my
country
find
a
vent
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
turned
involuntarily
,
and
saw
,
standing
close
at
his
side
,
a
sallow
gentleman
,
with
sunken
cheeks
,
black
hair
,
small
twinkling
eyes
,
and
a
singular
expression
hovering
about
that
region
of
his
face
,
which
was
not
a
frown
,
nor
a
leer
,
and
yet
might
have
been
mistaken
at
the
first
glance
for
either
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
it
would
have
been
difficult
,
on
a
much
closer
acquaintance
,
to
describe
it
in
any
more
satisfactory
terms
than
as
a
mixed
expression
of
vulgar
cunning
and
conceit
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
wore
a
rather
broad
-
brimmed
hat
for
the
greater
wisdom
of
his
appearance
;
and
had
his
arms
folded
for
the
greater
impressiveness
of
his
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
somewhat
shabbily
dressed
in
a
blue
surtout
reaching
nearly
to
his
ankles
,
short
loose
trousers
of
the
same
colour
,
and
a
faded
buff
waistcoat
,
through
which
a
discoloured
shirt
-
frill
struggled
to
force
itself
into
notice
,
as
asserting
an
equality
of
civil
rights
with
the
other
portions
of
his
dress
,
and
maintaining
a
declaration
of
Independence
on
its
own
account
.
 
<EOS>
His
feet
,
which
were
of
unusually
large
proportions
,
were
leisurely
crossed
before
him
as
he
half
leaned
against
,
<EOS>
half
sat
upon
,
the
steamboat
's
bulwark
;
and
his
thick
cane
,
shod
with
a
mighty
ferule
at
one
end
and
armed
with
a
great
metal
knob
at
the
other
,
depended
from
a
line
-
and
-
tassel
on
his
wrist
.
<EOS>
Thus
attired
,
and
thus
composed
into
an
aspect
of
great
profundity
,
the
gentleman
twitched
up
the
right
-
hand
corner
of
his
mouth
and
his
right
eye
simultaneously
,
and
said
,
once
more
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
in
such
enlightened
means
that
the
bubbling
passions
of
my
country
find
a
vent
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
looked
at
Martin
,
and
nobody
else
was
by
,
Martin
inclined
his
head
,
and
said
:
   
"
You
allude
to
---
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
the
Palladium
of
rational
Liberty
at
home
,
sir
,
and
the
dread
of
Foreign
oppression
abroad
,
"
returned
the
gentleman
,
as
he
pointed
with
his
cane
to
an
uncommonly
dirty
newsboy
with
one
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
Envy
of
the
world
,
sir
,
and
the
leaders
of
Human
Civilization
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
ask
you
sir
,
"
he
added
,
bringing
the
ferule
of
his
stick
heavily
upon
the
deck
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
must
not
be
equivocated
with
,
"
how
do
you
like
my
Country
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
hardly
prepared
to
answer
that
question
yet
,
"
said
Martin
"
seeing
that
I
have
not
been
ashore
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
should
expect
you
were
not
prepared
,
sir
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
to
behold
such
signs
of
National
Prosperity
as
those
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
the
vessels
lying
at
the
wharves
;
and
then
gave
a
vague
flourish
with
his
stick
,
as
if
he
would
include
the
air
and
water
,
generally
,
in
this
remark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
glanced
at
him
with
a
knowing
look
,
and
said
he
liked
his
policy
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
natural
,
he
said
,
and
it
pleased
him
as
a
philosopher
to
observe
the
prejudices
of
human
nature
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
brought
,
I
see
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
turning
round
towards
Martin
,
and
resting
his
chin
on
the
top
of
his
stick
,
"
the
usual
amount
of
misery
and
poverty
and
ignorance
and
crime
,
to
be
located
in
the
bosom
of
the
great
Republic
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
!
<EOS>
let
'em
come
on
in
shiploads
from
the
old
country
.
 
<EOS>
When
vessels
are
about
to
founder
,
the
rats
are
said
to
leave
'em
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
considerable
of
truth
,
I
find
,
in
that
remark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
ship
will
keep
afloat
a
year
or
two
longer
yet
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Martin
with
a
smile
,
partly
occasioned
by
what
the
gentleman
said
,
and
partly
by
his
manner
of
saying
it
,
which
was
odd
enough
for
he
emphasised
all
the
small
words
and
syllables
in
his
discourse
,
and
left
the
others
to
take
care
of
themselves
;
as
if
he
thought
the
larger
parts
of
speech
could
be
trusted
alone
,
but
the
little
ones
required
to
be
constantly
looked
after
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hope
is
said
by
the
poet
,
sir
,
"
observed
the
gentleman
,
"
to
be
the
nurse
of
young
Desire
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
signified
that
he
had
heard
of
the
cardinal
virtue
in
question
serving
occasionally
in
that
domestic
capacity
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
rear
her
infant
in
the
present
instance
,
sir
,
you
'll
find
,
"
observed
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Time
will
show
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
nodded
his
head
gravely
;
and
said
,
"
What
is
your
name
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
told
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
old
are
you
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
told
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
profession
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
told
him
that
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
destination
,
sir
?
"
inquired
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
said
Martin
laughing
,
"
I
ca
n't
satisfy
you
in
that
particular
,
for
I
do
n't
know
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
?
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
adjusted
his
cane
under
his
left
arm
,
and
took
a
more
deliberate
and
complete
survey
of
Martin
than
he
had
yet
had
leisure
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
completed
his
inspection
,
he
put
out
his
right
hand
,
shook
Martin
's
hand
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
My
name
is
Colonel
Diver
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
Editor
of
the
New
York
Rowdy
Journal
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
received
the
communication
with
that
degree
of
respect
which
an
announcement
so
distinguished
appeared
to
demand
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
New
York
Rowdy
Journal
,
sir
,
"
resumed
the
colonel
,
"
is
,
as
I
expect
you
know
,
the
organ
of
our
aristocracy
in
this
city
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
there
IS
an
aristocracy
here
,
then
?
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
what
is
it
composed
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
intelligence
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
colonel
;
"
of
intelligence
and
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
And
of
their
necessary
consequence
in
this
republic
---
 
dollars
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
was
very
glad
to
hear
this
,
feeling
well
assured
that
if
intelligence
and
virtue
led
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
to
the
acquisition
of
dollars
,
he
would
speedily
become
a
great
capitalist
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
express
the
gratification
such
news
afforded
him
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
who
came
up
at
the
moment
to
shake
hands
with
the
colonel
;
and
who
,
seeing
a
well
-
dressed
stranger
on
the
deck
(
for
Martin
had
thrown
aside
his
cloak
)
,
shook
hands
with
him
also
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
an
unspeakable
relief
to
Martin
,
who
,
in
spite
of
the
acknowledged
supremacy
of
Intelligence
and
virtue
in
that
happy
country
,
would
have
been
deeply
mortified
to
appear
before
Colonel
Diver
in
the
poor
character
of
a
steerage
passenger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
cap'en
!
"
said
the
colonel
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
colonel
,
"
cried
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
looking
most
uncommon
bright
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
realise
its
being
you

and
that
's
a
fact
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
good
passage
,
cap'en
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
colonel
,
taking
him
aside
,
   
<EOS>
"
Well
now
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
spanking
run
,
sir
,
"
said
,
or
rather
sung
,
the
captain
,
who
was
a
genuine
New
Englander
;
"
con
-
siderin
'
the
weather
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

said
the
colonel
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
sir
,
"
said
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
just
now
sent
a
boy
up
to
your
office
with
the
passenger

<EOS>
"
You

"
said
the
colonel
,
in
a
tone
almost
amounting
to
severity
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

there
air
a
dozen
if

"
One

observed
the
colonel
,
musing
,

to
my

You
said
a

I
think

<EOS>
"
Well

so
I
did

was
the
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
nigh

know

observed
the
colonel
.

"
I
'm
glad
it
was

Do
n't
mind
about

you
're
short
of

The

as
well
bring
four

twenty
pints

and
travel
twice

once

A

was
it
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
most
e####tarnal
spanker

said
the
skipper
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
admire
at
your
good
fortun

cap'en

<EOS>
You
might
loan
me
a
corkscrew
at
the
same
time
,
and
<EOS>
half
-
a

dozen
glasses
if
you
liked

<EOS>
However
bad
the
elements
combine
against
my
country
's
noble
packet
-
ship
,
the
Screw
,
sir
,
"
said
the
colonel
,
turning
to
Martin
,
and
drawing
a
flourish
on
the
surface
of
the
deck
with
his
cane
,
"
her
passage
either
way
is
almost
certain
to
eventuate
a
spanker
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
captain
,
who
had
the
Sewer
below
at
that
moment
,
lunching
expensively
in
one
cabin
,
while
the
amiable
Stabber
was
drinking
himself
into
a
state
of
blind
madness
in
another
,
took
a
cordial
leave
of
his
friend
the
colonel
,
and
hurried
away
to
dispatch
the
champagne
;
<EOS>
well
knowing
(
as
it
afterwards
appeared
)
that
if
he
failed
to
conciliate
the
editor
of
the
Rowdy
Journal
,
that
potentate
would
denounce
him
and
his
ship
in
large
capitals
before
he
was
a
day
older
;
and
would
probably
assault
the
memory
of
his
mother
also
,
who
had
not
been
dead
more
than
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
colonel
being
again
left
alone
with
Martin
,
checked
him
as
he
was
moving
away
,
and
offered
in
consideration
of
his
being
an
Englishman
,
to
show
him
the
town
and
to
introduce
him
,
if
such
were
his
desire
,
to
a
genteel
boarding
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
they
entered
on
these
proceedings
(
he
said
)
,
he
would
beseech
the
honour
of
his
company
at
the
office
of
the
Rowdy
Journal
,
to
partake
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
of
his
own
importation
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
was
so
extremely
kind
and
hospitable
,
that
Martin
,
though
it
was
quite
early
in
the
morning
,
readily
acquiesced
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
instructing
Mark
,
who
was
deeply
engaged
with
his
friend
and
her
three
children
,
that
when
he
had
done
assisting
them
,
and
had
cleared
the
baggage
,
he
was
to
wait
for
further
orders
at
the
Rowdy
Journal
Office
<EOS>
,
Martin
accompanied
his
new
friend
on
shore
.
   
<EOS>
They
made
their
way
as
they
best
could
through
the
melancholy
crowd
of
emigrants
upon
the
wharf
,
who
,
grouped
about
their
beds
and
boxes
,
with
the
bare
ground
below
them
and
the
bare
sky
above
,
might
have
fallen
from
another
planet
,
for
anything
they
knew
of
the
country
;
and
walked
for
some
short
distance
along
a
busy
street
,
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
quays
and
shipping
;
and
on
the
other
by
a
long
row
of
staring
red
-
brick
storehouses
and
offices
,
ornamented
with
more
black
boards
and
white
letters
,
and
more
white
boards
and
black
letters
,
than
Martin
had
ever
seen
before
,
in
fifty
times
the
space
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
they
turned
up
a
narrow
street
,
and
presently
into
other
narrow
streets
,
until
at
last
they
stopped
before
a
house
whereon
was
painted
in
great
characters
,
"
ROWDY
JOURNAL

"
   
<EOS>
The
colonel
,
who
had
walked
the
whole
way
with
one
hand
in
his
breast
,
his
head
occasionally
wagging
from
side
to
side
,
and
his
hat
thrown
back
upon
his
ears
,
like
a
man
who
was
oppressed
to
inconvenience
by
a
sense
of
his
own
greatness
,
led
the
way
up
a
dark
and
dirty
flight
of
stairs
into
a
room
of
similar
character
,
all
littered
and
bestrewn
with
odds
and
ends
of
newspapers
and
other
crumpled
fragments
,
both
in
proof
and
manuscript
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
a
mangy
old
writing
-
table
in
this
apartment
sat
a
figure
with
a
stump
of
a
pen
in
its
mouth
and
a
great
pair
of
scissors
in
its
right
hand
,
clipping
and
slicing
at
a
file
of
Rowdy
Journals
;
and
it
was
such
a
laughable
figure
that
Martin
had
some
difficulty
in
preserving
his
gravity
,
though
conscious
of
the
close
observation
of
Colonel
Diver
.
   
<EOS>
The
individual
who
sat
clipping
and
slicing
as
aforesaid
at
the
Rowdy
Journals
,
was
a
small
young
gentleman
of
very
juvenile
appearance
,
and
unwholesomely
pale
in
the
face
;
partly
,
perhaps
,
from
intense
thought
,
but
partly
,
there
is
no
doubt
,
from
the
excessive
use
of
tobacco
,
which
he
was
at
that
moment
chewing
vigorously
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
his
shirt
-
collar
turned
down
over
a
black
ribbon
;
and
his
lank
hair
,
a
fragile
crop
,
was
not
only
smoothed
and
parted
back
from
his
brow
,
that
none
of
the
Poetry
of
his
aspect
might
be
lost
,
but
had
,
here
and
there
,
been
grubbed
up
by
the
roots
;
which
accounted
for
his
loftiest
developments
being
somewhat
pimply
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
that
order
of
nose
on
which
the
envy
of
mankind
has
bestowed
the
appellation
"
snub
,
"
and
it
was
very
much
turned
up
at
the
end
,
as
with
a
lofty
scorn
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
upper
lip
of
this
young
gentleman
were
tokens
of
a
sandy
down
;
so
very
,
very
smooth
and
scant
,
that
,
though
encouraged
to
the
utmost
,
it
looked
more
like
a
recent
trace
of
gingerbread
than
the
fair
promise
of
a
moustache
;
and
this
conjecture
,
his
apparently
tender
age
went
far
to
strengthen
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
intent
upon
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
Every
time
he
snapped
the
great
pair
of
scissors
,
he
made
a
corresponding
motion
with
his
jaws
,
which
gave
him
a
very
terrible
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
was
not
long
in
determining
within
himself
that
this
must
be
Colonel
Diver
's
son
;
the
hope
of
the
family
,
and
future
mainspring
of
the
Rowdy
Journal
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
had
begun
to
say
that
he
presumed
this
was
the
colonel
's
little
boy
,
and
that
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
him
playing
at
Editor
in
all
the
guilelessness
of
childhood
,
when
the
colonel
proudly
interposed
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
War
Correspondent
,
sir
---
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
could
not
help
starting
at
this
unexpected
announcement
,
and
the
consciousness
of
the
irretrievable
mistake
he
had
nearly
made
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brick
seemed
pleased
with
the
sensation
he
produced
upon
the
stranger
,
and
shook
hands
with
him
,
with
an
air
of
patronage
designed
to
reassure
him
,
and
to
let
him
blow
that
there
was
no
occasion
to
be
frightened
,
for
he
(
Brick
)
would
n't
hurt
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
of
Jefferson
Brick
,
I
see
,
sir
,
"
quoth
the
colonel
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
England
has
heard
of
Jefferson
Brick
.
 
<EOS>
Europe
has
heard
of
Jefferson
Brick
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
When
did
you
leave
England
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Five
weeks
ago
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Five
weeks
ago
,
"
repeated
the
colonel
,
thoughtfully
;
as
he
took
his
seat
upon
the
table
,
and
swung
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
let
me
ask
you
,
sir
which
of
Mr
Brick
's
articles
had
become
at
that
time
the
most
obnoxious
to
the
British
Parliament
and
the
Court
of
Saint
James
's
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
I
---
"
   
"
I
have
reason
to
know
,
sir
,
"
interrupted
the
colonel
,
"
that
the
aristocratic
circles
of
your
country
quail
before
the
name
of
Jefferson
Brick
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
informed
,
sir
,
from
your
lips
,
which
of
his
sentiments
has
struck
the
deadliest
blow
---
"
   
"
At
the
hundred
heads
of
the
Hydra
of
Corruption
now
grovelling
in
the
dust
beneath
the
lance
of
Reason
,
and
spouting
up
to
the
universal
arch
above
us
,
its
sanguinary
gore
,
"
said
Mr
Brick
,
putting
on
a
little
blue
cloth
cap
with
a
glazed
front
,
and
quoting
his
last
article
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
libation
of
freedom
,
Brick
"
---
hinted
the
colonel
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
Must
sometimes
be
quaffed
in
blood
,
colonel
,
"
cried
Brick
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
said
"
blood
,
"
he
gave
the
great
pair
of
scissors
a
sharp
snap
,
as
if
THEY
said
blood
too
,
and
were
quite
of
his
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
both
looked
at
Martin
,
pausing
for
a
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
,
"
said
Martin
,
who
had
by
this
time
quite
recovered
his
usual
coolness
,
"
I
ca
n't
give
you
any
satisfactory
information
about
it
;
for
the
truth
is
that
I
---
"
   
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
colonel
,
glancing
sternly
at
his
war
correspondent
and
giving
his
head
one
shake
after
every
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
never
heard
of
Jefferson
Brick
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
never
read
Jefferson
Brick
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
never
saw
the
Rowdy
Journal
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
never
knew
,
sir
,
of
its
mighty
influence
upon
the
cabinets
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
was
about
to
observe
,
certainly
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
cool
,
Jefferson
,
"
said
the
colonel
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
bust
!
<EOS>
oh
you
Europeans
!
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
let
's
have
a
glass
of
wine
!
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
got
down
from
the
table
,
and
produced
,
from
a
basket
outside
the
door
,
a
bottle
of
champagne
,
and
three
glasses
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
sir
,
"
said
the
colonel
,
filling
Martin
's
glass
and
his
own
,
and
pushing
the
bottle
to
that
gentleman
,
"
will
give
us
a
sentiment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
"
cried
the
war
correspondent
,
"
Since
you
have
concluded
to
call
upon
me
,
I
will
respond
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
,
sir
,
The
Rowdy
Journal
and
its
brethren
;
the
well
of
Truth
,
whose
waters
are
black
from
being
composed
of
printers
'
ink
,
but
are
quite
clear
enough
for
my
country
to
behold
the
shadow
of
her
Destiny
reflected
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
colonel
,
with
great
complacency
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
flowery
components
,
sir
,
in
the
language
of
my
friend
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
so
,
indeed
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
to
-
day
's
Rowdy
,
sir
,
"
observed
the
colonel
,
handing
him
a
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
Jefferson
Brick
at
his
usual
post
in
the
van
of
human
civilization
and
moral
purity
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
colonel
was
by
this
time
seated
on
the
table
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Brick
also
took
up
a
position
on
that
same
piece
of
furniture
;
and
they
fell
to
drinking
pretty
hard
.
 
<EOS>
They
often
looked
at
Martin
as
he
read
the
paper
,
and
then
at
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
laid
it
down
,
which
was
not
until
they
had
finished
a
second
bottle
,
the
colonel
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
horribly
personal
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
The
colonel
seemed
much
flattered
by
this
remark
;
and
said
he
hoped
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
independent
here
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
as
we
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
may
judge
from
this
specimen
,
"
returned
Martin
,
"
there
must
be
a
few
thousands
here
,
rather
the
reverse
of
independent
,
who
do
as
they
do
n't
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
They
yield
to
the
popular
mind
of
the
Popular
Instructor
,
sir
,
"
said
the
colonel
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
rile
up
,
sometimes
;
but
in
general
we
have
a
hold
upon
our
citizens
,
both
in
public
and
in
private
life
,
which
is
as
much
one
of
the
ennobling
institutions
of
our
happy
country
as
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
As
nigger
slavery
itself
,
"
suggested
Mr
Brick
.
   
<EOS>
"
En
-
tirely
so
,
"
remarked
the
colonel
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
said
Martin
,
after
some
hesitation
,
"
may
I
venture
to
ask
,
with
reference
to
a
case
I
observe
in
this
paper
of
yours
,
whether
the
Popular
Instructor
often
deals
in
<EOS>
---
I
am
at
a
loss
to
express
it
without
giving
you
offence
---
in
forgery
?
 
<EOS>
In
forged
letters
,
for
instance
,
"
he
pursued
,
for
the
colonel
<EOS>
was
perfectly
calm
and
quite
at
his
ease
,
"
solemnly
purporting
to
have
been
written
at
recent
periods
by
living
men
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
"
replied
the
colonel
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
,
now
and
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
popular
instructed
---
what
do
they
do
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Buy
'
em
<EOS>
:
"
said
the
colonel
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
expectorated
and
laughed
;
the
former
copiously
,
the
latter
approvingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Buy
'em
by
hundreds
of
thousands
,
"
resumed
the
colonel
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
a
smart
people
here
,
and
can
appreciate
smartness
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
smartness
American
for
forgery
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
colonel
,
"
I
expect
it
's
American
for
a
good
many
things
that
you
call
by
other
names
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
ca
n't
help
yourself
in

<EOS>
We
can
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
do
,
sometimes
,
"
thought
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
help
yourselves
with
very
little
ceremony
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
whatever
name
we
choose
to
employ
,
"
said
the
colonel
,
stooping
down
to
roll
the
third
empty
bottle
into
a
corner
after
the
other
two
,
"
I
suppose
the
art
of
forgery
was
not
invented
here
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
replied
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
any
other
kind
of
smartness
I
reckon
?
"
   
"
Invented
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
presume
not
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
colonel
;
"
then
we
got
it
all
from
the
old
country
,
and
the
old
country
's
to
blame
for
it
,
and
not
the
new
'
un
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
an
end
of
THAT
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
and
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
clear
,
I
'll
come
out
last
,
and
lock
the
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rightly
interpreting
this
as
the
signal
for
their
departure
,
Martin
walked
downstairs
after
the
war
correspondent
,
who
preceded
him
with
great
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
The
colonel
following
,
they
left
the
Rowdy
Journal
Office
and
walked
forth
into
the
streets
;
Martin
feeling
doubtful
whether
he
ought
to
kick
the
colonel
for
having
presumed
to
speak
to
him
,
or
whether
it
came
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
he
and
his
establishment
could
be
among
the
boasted
usages
of
that
regenerated
land
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
Colonel
Diver
,
in
the
security
of
his
strong
position
,
and
in
his
perfect
understanding
of
the
public
sentiment
,
cared
very
little
what
Martin
or
anybody
else
thought
about
him
.
<EOS>
His
high
-
spiced
wares
were
made
to
sell
,
and
they
sold
;
and
his
thousands
of
readers
could
as
rationally
charge
their
delight
in
filth
upon
him
,
as
a
glutton
can
shift
upon
his
cook
the
responsibility
of
his
beastly
excess
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
would
have
delighted
the
colonel
more
than
to
be
told
that
no
such
man
as
he
could
walk
in
high
success
the
streets
of
any
other
country
in
the
world
;
for
that
would
only
have
been
a
logical
assurance
to
him
of
the
correct
adaptation
of
his
labours
to
the
prevailing
taste
,
and
of
his
being
strictly
and
peculiarly
a
national
feature
of
America
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
a
mile
or
more
along
a
handsome
street
which
the
colonel
said
was
called
Broadway
,
and
which
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
said
"
whipped
the
universe
.
"
 
<EOS>
Turning
,
at
length
,
into
one
of
the
numerous
streets
which
branched
from
this
main
thoroughfare
,
they
stopped
before
a
rather
mean
-
looking
house
with
jalousie
blinds
to
every
window
;
a
flight
of
steps
before
the
green
street
-
door
;
a
shining
white
ornament
on
the
rails
on
either
side
like
a
petrified
pineapple
,
polished
;
a
little
oblong
plate
of
the
same
material
over
the
knocker
whereon
the
name
of
"
Pawkins
"
was
engraved
;
and
four
accidental
pigs
looking
down
the
area
.
   
<EOS>
The
colonel
knocked
at
this
house
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
lived
there
;
and
an
Irish
girl
popped
her
head
out
of
one
of
the
top
windows
to
see
who
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Pending
her
journey
downstairs
,
the
pigs
were
joined
by
two
or
three
friends
from
the
next
street
,
in
company
with
whom
they
lay
down
sociably
in
the
gutter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
major
indoors
?
"
inquired
the
colonel
,
as
he
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
the
master
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
returned
the
girl
,
with
a
hesitation
which
seemed
to
imply
that
they
were
rather
flush
of
majors
in
that
establishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
master
!
"
said
Colonel
Diver
,
stopping
short
and
looking
round
at
his
war
correspondent
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
The
depressing
institutions
of
that
British
empire
,
colonel
!
"
said
Jefferson
Brick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Master
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
the
word
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
it
was
never
heard
in
our
country
,
sir
;
that
's
all
,
"
said
Jefferson
Brick
;
"
except
when
it
is
used
by
some
degraded
Help
,
as
new
to
the
blessings
of
our
form
of
government
,
as
this
Help
is
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
masters
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
"
owners
,
"
are
they
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
followed
in
the
Rowdy
Journal
's
footsteps
without
returning
any
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
took
the
same
course
,
thinking
as
he
went
,
that
perhaps
the
free
and
independent
citizens
,
who
in
their
moral
elevation
,
owned
the
colonel
for
their
master
,
might
render
better
homage
to
the
goddess
,
Liberty
,
in
nightly
dreams
upon
the
oven
of
a
Russian
Serf
.
   
<EOS>
The
colonel
led
the
way
into
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
upon
the
ground
-
floor
,
light
,
and
of
fair
dimensions
,
but
exquisitely
uncomfortable
;
having
nothing
in
it
but
the
four
cold
white
walls
and
ceiling
,
a
mean
carpet
,
a
dreary
waste
of
dining
-
table
reaching
from
end
to
end
,
and
a
bewildering
collection
of
cane
-
bottomed
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
further
region
of
this
banqueting
-
hall
was
a
stove
,
garnished
on
either
side
with
a
great
brass
spittoon
,
and
shaped
in
itself
like
three
little
iron
barrels
set
up
on
end
in
a
fender
,
and
joined
together
on
the
principle
of
the
Siamese
Twins
.
 
<EOS>
Before
it
,
swinging
himself
in
a
rocking
-
chair
,
lounged
a
large
gentleman
with
his
hat
on
,
who
amused
himself
by
spitting
alternately
into
the
spittoon
on
the
right
hand
of
the
stove
,
and
the
spittoon
on
the
left
,
and
then
working
his
way
back
again
in
the
same
order
.
 
<EOS>
A
negro
lad
in
a
soiled
white
jacket
was
busily
engaged
in
placing
on
the
table
two
long
rows
of
knives
and
forks
,
relieved
at
intervals
by
jugs
of
water
;
and
as
he
travelled
down
one
side
of
this
festive
board
,
he
straightened
with
his
dirty
hands
the
dirtier
cloth
,
which
was
all
askew
,
and
had
not
been
removed
since
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
of
this
room
was
rendered
intensely
hot
and
stifling
by
the
stove
;
but
being
further
flavoured
by
a
sickly
gush
of
soup
from
the
kitchen
,
and
by
such
remote
suggestions
of
tobacco
as
lingered
within
the
brazen
receptacles
already
mentioned
,
it
became
,
to
a
stranger
's
senses
,
almost
insupportable
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
in
the
rocking
-
chair
having
his
back
towards
them
,
and
being
much
engaged
in
his
intellectual
pastime
,
was
not
aware
of
their
approach
until
the
colonel
,
walking
up
to
the
stove
,
contributed
his
mite
towards
the
support
of
the
left
-
hand
spittoon
,
just
as
the
major
---
for
it
was
the
major
---
bore
down
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Major
Pawkins
then
reserved
his
fire
,
and
looking
upward
,
said
,
with
a
peculiar
air
of
quiet
weariness
,
like
a
man
who
had
been
up
all
night
---
an
air
which
Martin
had
already
observed
both
in
the
colonel
and
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
---
    
<EOS>
"
Well
,
colonel
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
gentleman
from
England
,
major
,
"
the
colonel
replied
,
"
who
has
concluded
to
locate
himself
here
if
the
amount
of
compensation
suits
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
sir
,
"
observed
the
major
,
shaking
hands
with
Martin
,
and
not
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
pretty
bright
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
better
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
never
likely
to
be
,
"
returned
the
major
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
the
sun
shine
HERE
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
remember
to
have
seen
it
shine
at
home
sometimes
,
"
said
Martin
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
replied
the
major
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
so
with
a
stoical
indifference
certainly
,
but
still
in
a
tone
of
firmness
which
admitted
of
no
further
dispute
on
that
point
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
thus
settled
the
question
,
he
put
his
hat
a
little
on
one
side
for
the
greater
convenience
of
scratching
his
head
,
and
saluted
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
with
a
lazy
nod
.
   
<EOS>
Major
Pawkins
(
a
gentleman
of
Pennsylvanian
origin
)
was
distinguished
by
a
very
large
skull
,
and
a
great
mass
of
yellow
forehead
;
in
deference
to
which
commodities
it
was
currently
held
in
bar
-
rooms
and
other
such
places
of
resort
that
the
major
was
a
man
of
huge
sagacity
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
further
to
be
known
by
a
heavy
eye
and
a
dull
slow
manner
;
and
for
being
a
man
of
that
kind
who
---
mentally
speaking
---
requires
a
deal
of
room
to
turn
himself
in
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
trading
on
his
stock
of
wisdom
,
he
invariably
proceeded
on
the
principle
of
putting
all
the
goods
he
had
(
and
more
)
into
his
window
;
and
that
went
a
great
way
with
his
constituency
of
admirers
.
<EOS>
It
went
a
great
way
,
perhaps
,
with
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
who
took
occasion
to
whisper
in
Martin
's
ear
:
   
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
our
country
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
supposed
,
however
,
that
the
perpetual
exhibition
in
the
market
-
place
of
all
his
stock
-
in
-
trade
for
sale
or
hire
,
was
the
major
's
sole
claim
to
a
very
large
share
of
sympathy
and
support
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
great
politician
;
and
the
one
article
of
his
creed
,
in
reference
to
all
public
obligations
involving
the
good
faith
and
integrity
of
his
country
,
was
,
"
run
a
moist
pen
slick
through
everything
,
and
start
fresh
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
made
him
a
patriot
.
 
<EOS>
In
commercial
affairs
he
was
a
bold
speculator
.
 
<EOS>
In
plainer
words
he
had
a
most
distinguished
genius
for
swindling
,
and
could
start
a
bank
,
or
negotiate
a
loan
,
or
form
a
land
-
jobbing
company
(
entailing
ruin
,
pestilence
,
and
death
,
on
hundreds
of
families
)
,
with
any
gifted
creature
in
the
Union
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
him
an
admirable
man
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
hang
about
a
bar
-
room
,
discussing
the
affairs
of
the
nation
,
for
twelve
hours
together
;
and
in
that
time
could
hold
forth
with
more
intolerable
dulness
,
chew
more
tobacco
,
smoke
more
tobacco
,
drink
more
rum
-
toddy
,
mint
-
julep
,
gin
-
sling
,
and
cocktail
,
than
any
private
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
him
an
orator
and
a
man
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
the
major
was
a
rising
character
,
and
a
popular
character
,
and
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
sent
by
the
popular
party
to
the
State
House
of
New
York
,
if
not
in
the
end
to
Washington
itself
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
a
man
's
private
prosperity
does
not
always
keep
pace
with
his
patriotic
devotion
to
public
affairs
;
and
as
fraudulent
transactions
have
their
downs
as
well
as
ups
,
the
major
was
occasionally
under
a
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
just
now
Mrs
Pawkins
kept
a
boarding
-
house
,
and
Major
Pawkins
rather
"
loafed
"
his
time
away
than
otherwise
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
to
visit
our
country
,
sir
,
at
a
season
of
great
commercial
depression
,
"
said
the
major
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
an
alarming
crisis
,
"
said
the
colonel
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
a
period
of
unprecedented
stagnation
,
"
said
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
,
"
returned
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
likely
to
last
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
knew
nothing
about
America
,
or
he
would
have
known
perfectly
well
that
if
its
individual
citizens
,
to
a
man
,
are
to
be
believed
,
it
always
IS
depressed
,
and
always
IS
stagnated
,
and
always
IS
at
an
alarming
crisis
,
and
never
was
otherwise
;
though
as
a
body
they
are
ready
to
make
oath
upon
the
Evangelists
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
,
that
it
is
the
most
thriving
and
prosperous
of
all
countries
on
the
habitable
globe
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
likely
to
last
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
returned
the
major
,
"
<EOS>
I
expect
we
shall
get
along
somehow
,
and
come
right
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
an
elastic
country
,
"
said
the
Rowdy
Journal
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
a
young
lion
,
"
said
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
revivifying
and
vigorous
principles
within
ourselves
,
"
observed
the
major
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
drink
a
bitter
afore
dinner
,
colonel
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
colonel
assenting
to
this
proposal
with
great
alacrity
,
Major
Pawkins
proposed
an
adjournment
to
a
neighbouring
bar
-
room
,
which
,
as
he
observed
,
was
"
only
in
the
next
block
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
referred
Martin
to
Mrs
Pawkins
for
all
particulars
connected
with
the
rate
of
board
and
lodging
,
and
informed
him
that
he
would
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
that
lady
at
dinner
,
which
would
soon
be
ready
,
as
the
dinner
hour
was
two
o'clock
,
and
it
only
wanted
a
quarter
now
.
 
<EOS>
This
reminded
him
that
if
the
bitter
were
to
be
taken
at
all
,
there
was
no
time
to
lose
;
so
he
walked
off
without
more
ado
,
and
left
them
to
follow
if
they
thought
proper
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
major
rose
from
his
rocking
-
chair
before
the
stove
,
and
so
disturbed
the
hot
air
and
balmy
whiff
of
soup
which
fanned
their
brows
,
the
odour
of
stale
tobacco
became
so
decidedly
prevalent
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
its
proceeding
mainly
from
that
gentleman
's
attire
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
as
Martin
walked
behind
him
to
the
bar
-
room
,
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
great
square
major
,
in
his
listlessness
and
langour
,
looked
very
much
like
a
stale
weed
himself
;
such
as
might
be
hoed
out
of
the
public
garden
,
with
great
advantage
to
the
decent
growth
of
that
preserve
,
and
tossed
on
some
congenial
dunghill
.
   
<EOS>
They
encountered
more
weeds
in
the
bar
-
room
,
some
of
whom
(
being
thirsty
souls
as
well
as
dirty
)
were
pretty
stale
in
one
sense
,
and
pretty
fresh
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
was
a
gentleman
who
,
as
Martin
gathered
from
the
conversation
that
took
place
over
the
bitter
,
started
that
afternoon
for
the
Far
West
on
a
six
months
'
business
tour
,
and
who
,
as
his
outfit
and
equipment
for
this
journey
,
had
just
such
another
shiny
hat
and
just
such
another
little
pale
valise
as
had
composed
the
luggage
of
the
gentleman
who
came
from
England
in
the
Screw
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
walking
back
very
leisurely
;
Martin
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
and
the
major
and
the
colonel
side
-
by
-
side
before
them
;
when
,
as
they
came
within
a
house
or
two
of
the
major
's
residence
,
they
heard
a
bell
ringing
violently
.
 
<EOS>
The
instant
this
sound
struck
upon
their
ears
,
the
colonel
and
the
major
darted
off
,
dashed
up
the
steps
and
in
at
the
street
-
door
(
which
stood
ajar
)
like
lunatics
;
while
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
detaching
his
arm
from
Martin
's
,
made
a
precipitate
dive
in
the
same
direction
,
and
vanished
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
premises
are
on
fire
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
alarm
bell
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
smoke
to
be
seen
,
nor
any
flame
,
nor
was
there
any
smell
of
fire
.
 
<EOS>
As
Martin
faltered
on
the
pavement
,
three
more
gentlemen
,
with
horror
and
agitation
depicted
in
their
faces
,
came
plunging
wildly
round
the
street
corner
;
jostled
each
other
on
the
steps
;
struggled
for
an
instant
;
and
rushed
into
the
house
,
a
confused
heap
of
arms
and
legs
.
 
<EOS>
Unable
to
bear
it
any
longer
,
Martin
followed
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
his
rapid
progress
he
was
run
down
,
thrust
aside
,
and
passed
,
by
two
more
gentlemen
,
stark
mad
,
as
it
appeared
,
with
fierce
excitement
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
breathlessly
,
to
a
negro
whom
he
encountered
in
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
eatin
room
,
sa
.
 
<EOS>
Kernell
,
sa
,

<EOS>
kep

seat
"
side
himself
,
sa
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
seat
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
a
dinnar
,
sa
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
started
at
him
for
a
moment
,
and
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
;
to
which
the
negro
,
out
of
his
natural
good
humour
and
desire
to
please
,
so
heartily
responded
,
that
his
teeth
shone
like
a
gleam
of
light
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
pleasantest
fellow
I
have
seen
yet
,
"
said
Martin
clapping
him
on
the
back
,
"
and
give
me
a
better
appetite
than
bitters
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
sentiment
he
walked
into
the
dining
-
room
and
slipped
into
a
chair
next
the
colonel
,
which
that
gentleman
(
by
this
time
nearly
through
his
dinner
)
had
turned
down
in
reserve
for
him
,
with
its
back
against
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
numerous
company
---
eighteen
or
twenty
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
Of
these
some
five
or
six
were
ladies
,
who
sat
wedged
together
in
a
little
phalanx
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
knives
and
forks
were
working
away
at
a
rate
that
was
quite
alarming
;
very
few
words
were
spoken
;
and
everybody
seemed
to
eat
his
utmost
in
self
-
defence
,
as
if
a
famine
were
expected
to
set
in
before
breakfast
time
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
it
had
become
high
time
to
assert
the
first
law
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
The
poultry
,
which
may
perhaps
be
considered
to
have
formed
the
staple
of
the
entertainment
---
for
there
was
a
turkey
at
the
top
,
a
pair
of
ducks
at
the
bottom
,
and
two
fowls
in
the
middle
---
disappeared
as
rapidly
as
if
every
bird
had
had
the
use
of
its
wings
,
and
had
flown
in
desperation
down
a
human
throat
.
 
<EOS>
The
oysters
,
stewed
and
pickled
,
leaped
from
their
capacious
reservoirs
,
and
slid
by
scores
into
the
mouths
of
the
assembly
.
 
<EOS>
The
sharpest
pickles
vanished
,
whole
cucumbers
at
once
,
like
sugar
-
plums
,
and
no
man
winked
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Great
heaps
of
indigestible
matter
melted
away
as
ice
before
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
solemn
and
an
awful
thing
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Dyspeptic
individuals
bolted
their
food
in
wedges
;
feeding
,
not
themselves
,
but
broods
of
nightmares
,
who
were
continually
standing
at
livery
within
them
.
 
<EOS>
Spare
men
,
with
lank
and
rigid
cheeks
,
came
out
unsatisfied
from
the
destruction
of
heavy
dishes
,
and
glared
with
watchful
eyes
upon
the
pastry
.
 
<EOS>
What
Mrs
Pawkins
felt
each
day
at
dinner
-
time
is
hidden
from
all
human
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
had
one
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
soon
over
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
colonel
had
finished
his
dinner
,
which
event
took
place
while
Martin
,
who
had
sent
his
plate
for
some
turkey
,
was
waiting
to
begin
,
he
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
boarders
,
who
were
from
all
parts
of
the
Union
,
and
whether
he
would
like
to
know
any
particulars
concerning
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
who
is
that
sickly
little
girl
opposite
,
with
the
tight
round
eyes
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
anybody
here
,
who
looks
like
her
mother
,
or
who
seems
to
have
charge
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
the
matron
in
blue
,
sir
?
"
asked
the
colonel
,
with
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
Mrs
Jefferson
Brick
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
<EOS>
I
mean
the
little
girl
,
like
a
doll
;
directly
opposite
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
"
cried
the
colonel
.
 
<EOS>
"
THAT
is
Mrs
Jefferson
Brick
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
glanced
at
the
colonel
's
face
,
but
he
was
quite
serious
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
will
be
a
young
Brick
then
,
one
of
these
days
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
two
young
Bricks
already
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
colonel
.
   
<EOS>
The
matron
looked
so
uncommonly
like
a
child
herself
,
that
Martin
could
not
help
saying
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
colonel
,
"
but
some
institutions
develop
human
natur
;
others
re
---
tard
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jefferson
Brick
,
"
he
observed
after
a
short
silence
,
in
commendation
of
his
correspondent
,
"
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
our
country
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
had
passed
almost
in
a
whisper
,
for
the
distinguished
gentleman
alluded
to
sat
on
Martin
's
other
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mr
Brick
,
"
said
Martin
,
turning
to
him
,
and
asking
a
question
more
for
conversation
's
sake
than
from
any
feeling
of
interest
in
its
subject
,
"
who
is
that
;
"
he
was
going
to
say
"
young
"
but
thought
it
prudent
to
eschew
the
word
---
"
that
very
short
gentleman
yonder
,
with
the
red
nose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
Pro
---
fessor
Mullit
,
sir
,
"
replied
Jefferson
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
what
he
is
professor
of
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
education
,
sir
,
"
said
Jefferson
Brick
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
sort
of
schoolmaster
,
possibly
?
<EOS>
"
Martin
ventured
to
observe
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
of
fine
moral
elements
,
sir
,
and
not
commonly
endowed
,
"
said
the
war
correspondent
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
felt
it
necessary
,
at
the
last
election
for
President
,
to
repudiate
and
denounce
his
father
,
who
voted
on
the
wrong
interest
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
since
written
some
powerful
pamphlets
,
under
the
signature
of
"
Suturb
,
"
or
Brutus
reversed
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
our
country
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
seem
to
be
plenty
of
'
em
,
"
thought
Martin
,
"
at
any
rate
.
"
   
<EOS>
Pursuing
his
inquiries
Martin
found
that
there
were
no
fewer
than
four
majors
present
,
two
colonels
,
one
general
,
and
a
captain
,
so
that
he
could
not
help
thinking
how
strongly
officered
the
American
militia
must
be
;
and
wondering
very
much
whether
the
officers
commanded
each
other
;
or
if
they
did
not
,
where
on
earth
the
privates
came
from
.
 
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
no
man
there
without
a
title
;
for
those
who
had
not
attained
to
military
honours
were
either
doctors
,
professors
,
or
reverends
.
 
<EOS>
Three
very
hard
and
disagreeable
gentlemen
were
on
missions
from
neighbouring
States
;
one
on
monetary
affairs
,
one
on
political
,
one
on
sectarian
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
ladies
,
there
were
Mrs
Pawkins
,
who
was
very
straight
,
bony
,
and
silent
;
and
a
wiry
-
faced
old
damsel
,
who
held
strong
sentiments
touching
the
rights
of
women
,
and
had
diffused
the
same
in
lectures
;
but
the
rest
were
strangely
devoid
of
individual
traits
of
character
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
any
one
of
them
might
have
changed
minds
with
the
other
,
and
nobody
would
have
found
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
by
the
way
,
were
the
only
members
of
the
party
who
did
not
appear
to
be
among
the
most
remarkable
people
in
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
Several
of
the
gentlemen
got
up
,
one
by
one
,
and
walked
off
as
they
swallowed
their
last
morsel
;
pausing
generally
by
the
stove
for
a
minute
or
so
to
refresh
themselves
at
the
brass
spittoons
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
sedentary
characters
,
however
,
remained
at
table
full
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
did
not
rise
until
the
ladies
rose
,
when
all
stood
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
going
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Martin
,
in
the
ear
of
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
their
bedrooms
,
sir
.
"
   
"
Is
there
no
dessert
,
or
other
interval
of
conversation
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Martin
,
who
was
disposed
to
enjoy
himself
after
his
long
voyage
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
a
busy
people
here
,
sir
,
and
have
no
time
for
that
,
"
was
the
reply
.
   
<EOS>
So
the
ladies
passed
out
in
single
file
;
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
and
such
other
married
gentlemen
as
were
left
,
acknowledging
the
departure
of
their
other
halves
by
a
nod
;
and
there
was
an
end
of
THEM
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
thought
this
an
uncomfortable
custom
,
but
he
kept
his
opinion
to
himself
for
the
present
,
being
anxious
to
hear
,
and
inform
himself
by
,
the
conversation
of
the
busy
gentlemen
,
who
now
lounged
about
the
stove
as
if
a
great
weight
had
been
taken
off
their
minds
by
the
withdrawal
of
the
other
sex
;
and
who
made
a
plentiful
use
of
the
spittoons
and
their
toothpicks
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
rather
barren
of
interest
,
to
say
the
truth
;
and
the
greater
part
of
it
may
be
summed
up
in
one
word
.
 
<EOS>
Dollars
.
 
<EOS>
All
their
cares
,
hopes
,
joys
,
affections
,
virtues
,
and
associations
,
seemed
to
be
melted
down
into
dollars
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
the
chance
contributions
that
fell
into
the
slow
cauldron
of
their
talk
,
they
made
the
gruel
thick
and
slab
with
dollars
.
 
<EOS>
Men
were
weighed
by
their
dollars
,
measures
gauged
by
their
dollars
;
life
was
auctioneered
,
appraised
,
put
up
,
and
knocked
down
for
its
dollars
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
respectable
thing
to
dollars
was
any
venture
having
their
attainment
for
its
end
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
of
that
worthless
ballast
,
honour
and
fair
-
dealing
,
which
any
man
cast
overboard
from
the
ship
of
his
Good
Name
and
Good
Intent
,
the
more
ample
stowage
-
room
he
had
for
dollars
.
 
<EOS>
Make
commerce
one
huge
lie
and
mighty
theft
.
 
<EOS>
Deface
<EOS>
the
banner
of
the
nation
for
an
idle
rag
;
pollute
it
star
by
star
;
and
cut
out
stripe
by
stripe
as
from
the
arm
of
a
degraded
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
Do
anything
for
dollars
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
a
flag
to
THEM
!
   
<EOS>
One
who
rides
at
all
hazards
of
limb
and
life
in
the
chase
of
a
fox
,
will
prefer
to
ride
recklessly
at
most
times
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
was
with
these
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
greatest
patriot
,
in
their
eyes
,
who
brawled
the
loudest
,
and
who
cared
the
least
for
decency
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
their
champion
who
,
in
the
brutal
fury
of
his
own
pursuit
,
could
cast
no
stigma
upon
them
for
the
hot
knavery
of
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
Martin
learned
in
the
five
minutes
'
straggling
talk
about
the
stove
,
that
to
carry
pistols
into
legislative
assemblies
,
and
swords
in
sticks
,
and
other
such
peaceful
toys
;
to
seize
opponents
by
the
throat
,
as
dogs
or
rats
might
do
;
to
bluster
,
bully
,
and
overbear
by
personal
assailment
;
were
glowing
deeds
.
 
<EOS>
Not
thrusts
and
stabs
at
Freedom
,
striking
far
deeper
into
her
House
of
Life
than
any
sultan
's
scimitar
could
reach
;
but
rare
incense
on
her
altars
,
having
a
grateful
scent
in
patriotic
nostrils
,
and
curling
upward
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
Fame
.
   
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
,
when
there
was
a
pause
,
Martin
asked
such
questions
as
naturally
occurred
to
him
,
being
a
stranger
,
about
the
national
poets
,
the
theatre
,
literature
,
and
the
arts
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
information
which
these
gentlemen
were
in
a
condition
to
give
him
on
such
topics
,
did
not
extend
beyond
the
effusions
of
such
master
-
spirits
of
the
time
as
Colonel
Diver
,
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
and
others
;
renowned
,
as
it
appeared
,
for
excellence
in
the
achievement
of
a
peculiar
style
of
broadside
essay
called
"
a
screamer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
a
busy
people
,
sir
,
"
said
one
of
the
captains
,
who
was
from
the
West
,
"
and
have
no
time
for
reading
mere
notions
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
mind
'em
if
they
come
to
us
in
newspapers
along
with
almighty
strong
stuff
of
another
sort
,
but
darn
your
books
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
general
,
who
appeared
to
grow
quite
faint
at
the
bare
thought
of
reading
anything
which
was
neither
mercantile
nor
political
,
and
was
not
in
a
newspaper
,
inquired
"
if
any
gentleman
would
drink
some
?
"
 
<EOS>
Most
of
the
company
,
considering
this
a
very
choice
and
seasonable
idea
,
lounged
out
,
one
by
one
,
to
the
bar
-
room
in
the
next
block
.
 
<EOS>
Thence
<EOS>
they
probably
went
to
their
stores
and
counting
-
houses
;
thence
to
the
bar
-
room
again
,
to
talk
once
more
of
dollars
,
and
enlarge
their
minds
with
the
perusal
and
discussion
of
screamers
;
and
thence
each
man
to
snore
in
the
bosom
of
his
own
family
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
would
seem
,
"
said
Martin
,
pursuing
the
current
of
his
own
thoughts
,
"
to
be
the
principal
recreation
they
enjoy
in
common
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
fell
a
-
musing
again
on
dollars
,
demagogues
,
and
bar
-
rooms
;
debating
within
himself
whether
busy
people
of
this
class
were
really
as
busy
as
they
claimed
to
be
,
or
only
had
an
inaptitude
for
social
and
domestic
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
difficult
question
to
solve
;
and
the
mere
fact
of
its
being
strongly
presented
to
his
mind
by
all
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
,
was
not
encouraging
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
at
the
deserted
board
,
and
becoming
more
and
more
despondent
,
as
he
thought
of
all
the
uncertainties
and
difficulties
of
his
precarious
situation
,
sighed
heavily
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
there
had
been
at
the
dinner
-
table
a
middle
-
aged
man
with
a
dark
eye
and
a
sunburnt
face
,
who
had
attracted
Martin
's
attention
by
having
something
very
engaging
and
honest
in
the
expression
of
his
features
;
but
of
whom
he
could
learn
nothing
from
either
of
his
neighbours
,
who
seemed
to
consider
him
quite
beneath
their
notice
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
no
part
in
the
conversation
round
the
stove
,
nor
had
he
gone
forth
with
the
rest
;
and
now
,
when
he
heard
Martin
sigh
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
,
he
interposed
with
some
casual
remark
,
as
if
he
desired
,
without
obtruding
himself
upon
a
stranger
's
notice
,
to
engage
him
in
cheerful
conversation
if
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
His
motive
was
so
obvious
,
and
yet
so
delicately
expressed
,
that
Martin
felt
really
grateful
to
him
,
and
showed
him
so
in
the
manner
of
his
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
ask
you
,
"
said
this
gentleman
with
a
smile
,
as
he
rose
and
moved
towards
him
,
"
how
you
like
my
country
,
for
I
can
quite
anticipate
your
feeling
on
that
point
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
am
an
American
,
and
consequently
bound
to
begin
with
a
question
,
I
'll
ask
you
how
you
like
the
colonel
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
very
frank
,
"
returned
Martin
,
"
that
I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
I
do
n't
like
him
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
must
add
that
I
am
beholden
to
him
for
his
civility
in
bringing
me
here
---
and
arranging
for
my
stay
,
on
pretty
reasonable
terms
,
by
the
way
,
"
he
added
,
remembering
that
the
colonel
had
whispered
him
to
that
effect
,
before
going
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
much
beholden
,
"
said
the
stranger
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
colonel
occasionally
boards
packet
-
ships
,
I
have
heard
,
to
glean
the
latest
information
for
his
journal
;
and
he
occasionally
brings
strangers
to
board
here
,
I
believe
,
with
a
view
to
the
little
percentage
which
attaches
to
those
good
offices
;
and
which
the
hostess
deducts
from
his
weekly
bill
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
offend
you
,
I
hope
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
seeing
that
Martin
reddened
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
"
returned
Martin
,
as
they
shook
hands
,
"
how
is
that
possible
!
<EOS>
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
---
am
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
said
the
gentleman
,
sitting
down
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
rather
at
a
loss
,
since
I
must
speak
plainly
,
"
said
Martin
,
getting
the
better
of
his
hesitation
,
"
to
know
how
this
colonel
escapes
being
beaten
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
beaten
once
or
twice
,
"
remarked
the
gentleman
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
one
of
a
class
of
men
,
in
whom
our
own
Franklin
,
so
long
ago
as
ten
years
before
the
close
of
the
last
century
,
foresaw
our
danger
and
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
do
n't
know
that
Franklin
,
in
very
severe
terms
,
published
his
opinion
that
those
who
were
slandered
by
such
fellows
as
this
colonel
,
having
no
sufficient
remedy
in
the
administration
of
this
country
's
laws
or
in
the
decent
and
right
-
minded
feeling
of
its
people
,
were
justified
in
retorting
on
such
public
nuisances
by
means
of
a
stout
cudgel
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
aware
of
that
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
but
I
am
very
glad
to
know
it
,
and
I
think
it
worthy
of
his
memory
;
especially
"
---
here
he
hesitated
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
said
the
other
,
smiling
as
if
he
knew
what
stuck
in
Martin
's
throat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Especially
,
"
pursued
Martin
,
"
as
I
can
already
understand
that
it
may
have
required
great
courage
,
even
in
his
time
,
to
write
freely
on
any
question
which
was
not
a
party
one
in
this
very
free
country
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Some
courage
,
no
doubt
,
"
returned
his
new
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
it
would
require
any
to
do
so
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
think
it
would
;
and
not
a
little
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
 
<EOS>
So
very
right
<EOS>
,
that
I
believe
no
satirist
could
breathe
this
air
.
 
<EOS>
If
another
Juvenal
or
Swift
could
rise
up
among
us
to
-
morrow
,
he
would
be
hunted
down
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
knowledge
of
our
literature
,
and
can
give
me
the
name
of
any
man
,
American
born
and
bred
,
who
has
anatomized
our
follies
as
a
people
,
and
not
as
this
or
that
party
;
and
who
has
escaped
the
foulest
and
most
brutal
slander
,
the
most
inveterate
hatred
and
intolerant
pursuit
;
it
will
be
a
strange
name
in
my
ears
,
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
some
cases
I
could
name
to
you
,
where
a
native
writer
has
ventured
on
the
most
harmless
and
good
-
humoured
illustrations
of
our
vices
or
defects
,
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
announce
,
that
in
a
second
edition
the
passage
has
been
expunged
,
or
altered
,
or
explained
away
,
or
patched
into
praise
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
has
this
been
brought
about
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Martin
,
in
dismay
.
   
<EOS>
"
Think
of
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
to
-
day
,
beginning
with
the
colonel
,
"
said
his
friend
,
"
and
ask
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
How
THEY
came
about
,
is
another
question
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
that
they
should
be
samples
of
the
intelligence
and
virtue
of
America
,
but
they
come
uppermost
,
and
in
great
numbers
,
and
too
often
represent
it
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
walk
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
cordial
candour
in
his
manner
,
and
an
engaging
confidence
that
it
would
not
be
abused
;
a
manly
bearing
on
his
own
part
,
and
a
simple
reliance
on
the
manly
faith
of
a
stranger
;
which
Martin
had
never
seen
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
linked
his
arm
readily
in
that
of
the
American
gentleman
,
and
they
walked
out
together
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
perhaps
to
men
like
this
,
his
new
companion
,
that
a
traveller
of
honoured
name
,
who
trod
those
shores
now
nearly
forty
years
ago
,
and
woke
upon
that
soil
,
as
many
have
done
since
,
to
blots
and
stains
upon
its
high
pretensions
,
which
in
the
brightness
of
his
distant
dreams
were
lost
to
view
,
appealed
in
these
words
---
     
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
but
for
such
,
Columbia
's
days
were
done
;
     
Rank
without
ripeness
,
quickened
without
sun
,
     
Crude
at
the
surface
,
rotten
at
the
core
,
     
Her
fruits
would
fall
before
her
spring
were
o'er
!
"
    
Chapter
17
.
<EOS>
Martin
enlarges
his
circle
of
aquaintance
;
increases
his
stock
of
wisdom
;
and
has
an
excellent
opportunity
of
comparing
his
own
experiences
with
those
of
Lummy
Ned
of
the
Light
Salisbury
,
as
related
by
his
friend
Mr
William
Simmons
 
<EOS>
It
was
characteristic
of
Martin
,
that
all
this
while
he
had
either
forgotten
Mark
Tapley
as
completely
as
if
there
had
been
no
such
person
in
existence
,
or
,
if
for
a
moment
the
figure
of
that
gentleman
rose
before
his
mental
vision
,
had
dismissed
it
as
something
by
no
means
of
a
pressing
nature
,
which
might
be
attended
to
by
-
and
-
bye
,
and
could
wait
his
perfect
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
being
now
in
the
streets
again
,
it
occurred
to
him
as
just
coming
within
the
bare
limits
of
possibility
that
Mr
Tapley
might
,
in
course
of
time
,
grow
tired
of
waiting
on
the
threshold
of
the
Rowdy
Journal
Office
,
so
he
intimated
to
his
new
friend
,
that
if
they
could
conveniently
walk
in
that
direction
,
he
would
be
glad
to
get
this
piece
of
business
off
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
speaking
of
business
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
may
I
ask
,
in
order
that
I
may
not
be
behind
-
hand
with
questions
either
,
whether
your
occupation
holds
you
to
this
city
,
or
like
myself
,
you
are
a
visitor
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
visitor
,
"
replied
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
"
raised
"
in
the
State
of
Massachusetts
,
and
reside
there
still
.
 
<EOS>
My
home
is
in
a
quiet
country
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
often
in
these
busy
places
;
and
my
inclination
to
visit
them
does
not
increase
with
our
better
acquaintance
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
abroad
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Martin
,
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
,
like
most
people
who
travel
,
have
become
more
than
ever
attached
to
your
home
and
native
country
,
"
said
Martin
,
eyeing
him
curiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
my
home
---
yes
,
"
rejoined
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
my
native
country
AS
my
home
---
yes
,
also
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
imply
some
reservation
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
his
new
friend
,
"
if
you
ask
me
whether
I
came
back
here
with
a
greater
relish
for
my
country
's
faults
;
with
a
greater
fondness
for
those
who
claim
(
at
the
rate
of
so
many
dollars
a
day
)
to
be
her
friends
;
with
a
cooler
indifference
to
the
growth
of
principles
among
us
in
respect
of
public
matters
and
of
private
dealings
between
man
and
man
,
the
advocacy
of
which
,
beyond
the
foul
atmosphere
of
a
criminal
trial
,
would
disgrace
your
own
old
Bailey
lawyers
;
why
,
then
I
answer
plainly
,
No
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Martin
;
in
so
exactly
the
same
key
as
his
friend
's
No
,
that
it
sounded
like
an
echo
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
ask
me
,
"
his
companion
pursued
,
"
whether
I
came
back
here
better
satisfied
with
a
state
of
things
which
broadly
divides
society
into
two
classes
---
whereof
one
,
the
great
mass
,
<EOS>
asserts
a
spurious
independence
,
most
miserably
dependent
for
its
mean
existence
on
the
disregard
of
humanizing
conventionalities
of
manner
and
social
custom
,
so
that
the
coarser
a
man
is
,
the
more
distinctly
it
shall
appeal
to
his
taste
;
while
the
other
,
disgusted
with
the
low
standard
thus
set
up
and
made
adaptable
to
everything
,
takes
refuge
among
the
graces
and
refinements
it
can
bring
to
bear
on
private
life
,
and
leaves
the
public
weal
to
such
fortune
as
may
betide
it
in
the
press
and
uproar
of
a
general
scramble
---
then
again
I
answer
,
No
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
And
again
Martin
said
"
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
in
the
same
odd
way
as
before
,
being
anxious
and
disconcerted
;
not
so
much
,
to
say
the
truth
,
on
public
grounds
,
as
with
reference
to
the
fading
prospects
of
domestic
architecture
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
"
resumed
the
other
,
"
I
do
not
find
and
can
not
believe
and
therefore
will
not
allow
,
that
we
are
a
model
of
wisdom
,
and
an
example
to
the
world
,
and
the
perfection
of
human
reason
,
and
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
which
you
may
hear
any
hour
in
the
day
;
simply
because
we
began
our
political
life
with
two
inestimable
advantages
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
were
they
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
,
that
our
history
commenced
at
so
late
a
period
as
to
escape
the
ages
of
bloodshed
and
cruelty
through
which
other
nations
have
passed
;
and
so
had
all
the
light
of
their
probation
,
and
none
of
its
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
,
that
we
have
a
vast
territory
,
and
not
---
as
yet
---
too
many
people
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
These
facts
considered
,
we
have
done
little
enough
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Education
?
"
suggested
Martin
,
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
on
that
head
,
"
said
the
other
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
"
still
no
mighty
matter
to
boast
of
;
for
old
countries
,
and
despotic
countries
too
,
have
done
as
much
,
if
not
more
,
and
made
less
noise
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
shine
out
brightly
in
comparison
with
England
,
certainly
;
but
hers
is
a
very
extreme
case
.
 
<EOS>
You
complimented
me
on
my
frankness
,
you
know
,
"
he
added
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
astonished
at
your
speaking
thus
openly
when
my
country
is
in
question
,
"
returned
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
plain
-
speaking
in
reference
to
your
own
that
surprises
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
it
a
scarce
quality
here
,
I
assure
you
,
saving
among
the
Colonel
Divers
,
and
Jefferson
Bricks
,
and
Major
Pawkinses
;
though
the
best
of
us
are
something
like
the
man
in
Goldsmith
's
comedy
,
who
would
n't
suffer
anybody
but
himself
to
abuse
his
master
.
<EOS>
Come
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
talk
of
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
come
here
on
some
design
of
improving
your
fortune
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
and
I
should
grieve
to
put
you
out
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
some
years
older
than
you
,
besides
;
and
may
,
on
a
few
trivial
points
,
advise
you
,
perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
least
curiosity
or
impertinence
in
the
manner
of
this
offer
,
which
was
open
-
hearted
,
unaffected
,
and
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
next
to
impossible
that
he
should
not
have
his
confidence
awakened
by
a
deportment
so
prepossessing
and
kind
<EOS>
,
Martin
plainly
stated
what
had
brought
him
into
those
parts
,
and
even
made
the
very
difficult
avowal
that
he
was
poor
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
say
how
poor
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
rather
throwing
off
the
declaration
with
an
air
which
might
have
implied
that
he
had
money
enough
for
six
months
,
instead
of
as
many
weeks
;
but
poor
he
said
he
was
,
and
grateful
<EOS>
he
said
he
would
be
,
for
any
counsel
that
his
friend
would
give
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
been
very
difficult
for
any
one
to
see
;
but
it
was
particularly
easy
for
Martin
,
whose
perceptions
were
sharpened
by
his
circumstances
,
to
discern
;
that
the
stranger
's
face
grew
infinitely
longer
as
the
domestic
-
architecture
project
was
developed
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
,
although
he
made
a
great
effort
to
be
as
encouraging
as
possible
,
could
he
prevent
his
head
from
shaking
once
involuntarily
,
as
if
it
said
in
the
vulgar
tongue
,
upon
its
own
account
,
"
No
go
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
spoke
in
a
cheerful
tone
,
and
said
,
that
although
there
was
no
such
opening
as
Martin
wished
,
in
that
city
,
he
would
make
it
matter
of
immediate
consideration
and
inquiry
where
one
was
most
likely
to
exist
;
and
then
he
made
Martin
acquainted
with
his
name
,
which
was
Bevan
;
and
with
his
profession
,
which
was
physic
,
though
he
seldom
or
never
practiced
;
and
with
other
circumstances
connected
with
himself
and
family
,
which
fully
occupied
the
time
,
until
they
reached
the
Rowdy
Journal
Office
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
appeared
to
be
taking
his
ease
on
the
landing
of
the
first
floor
;
for
sounds
as
of
some
gentleman
established
in
that
region
whistling
"
Rule
Britannia
"
with
all
his
might
and
main
,
greeted
their
ears
before
they
reached
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
On
ascending
to
the
spot
from
whence
this
music
proceeded
,
they
found
him
recumbent
in
the
midst
of
a
fortification
of
luggage
,
apparently
performing
his
national
anthem
for
the
gratification
of
a
grey
-
haired
black
man
,
who
sat
on
one
of
the
outworks
(
a
portmanteau
)
,
staring
intently
at
Mark
,
while
Mark
,
with
his
head
reclining
on
his
hand
,
returned
the
compliment
in
a
thoughtful
manner
,
and
whistled
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
have
recently
dined
,
for
his
knife
,
a
casebottle
,
and
certain
broken
meats
in
a
handkerchief
,
lay
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
employed
a
portion
of
his
leisure
in
the
decoration
of
the
Rowdy
Journal
door
,
whereon
his
own
initials
now
appeared
in
letters
nearly
half
a
foot
long
,
together
with
the
day
of
the
month
in
smaller
type
;
the
whole
surrounded
by
an
ornamental
border
,
and
looking
very
fresh
and
bold
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
a'most
afraid
you
was
lost
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
,
rising
,
and
stopping
the
tune
at
that
point
where
Britons
generally
are
supposed
to
declare
(
when
it
is
whistled
)
that
they
never
,
never
,
never
---
    
"
Nothing
gone
wrong
,
I
hope
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
your
friend
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
mad
woman
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
's
all
right
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
she
find
her
husband
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Leastways
she
's
found
his
remains
,
"
said
Mark
,
correcting
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
man
's
not
dead
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
altogether
dead
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
;
"
but
he
's
had
more
fevers
and
agues
than
is
quite
reconcilable
with
being
alive
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
did
n't
see
him
a
-
waiting
for
her
,
I
thought
she
'd
have
died
herself
,
I
did
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
he
not
here
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
HE
was
n't
here
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
feeble
old
shadow
<EOS>
come
a
-
creeping
down
at
last
,
as
much
like
his
substance
when
she
know'd
him
,
as
your
shadow
when
it
's
drawn
out
to
its
very
finest
and
longest
by
the
sun
,
is
like
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
his
remains
<EOS>
,
there
's
no
doubt
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
on
with
joy
,
poor
thing
,
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
all
of
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Had
he
bought
land
?
"
asked
Mr
Bevan
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
He
'd
bought
land
,
"
said
Mark
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
and
paid
for
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
Every
sort
of
nateral
advantage
was
connected
with
it
,
the
agents
said
;
and
there
certainly
was
ONE
,
quite
unlimited
.
 
<EOS>
No
end
to
the
water
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
thing
he
could
n't
have
done
without
,
I
suppose
,
"
observed
Martin
,
peevishly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
There
it
was
,
any
way
;
always
turned
on
,
and
no
water
-
rate
.
 
<EOS>
Independent
of
three
or
four
slimy
old
rivers
close
by
<EOS>
,
it
varied
on
the
farm
from
four
to
six
foot
deep
in
the
dry
season
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
say
how
deep
it
was
in
the
rainy
time
,
for
he
never
had
anything
long
enough
to
sound
it
with
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
this
true
?
"
asked
Martin
of
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Extremely
probable
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
Mississippi
or
Missouri
lot
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
pursued
Mark
,
"
he
came
from
I
-
don't
-
know
-
where
-
and
-
all
,
down
to
New
York
here
,
to
meet
his
wife
and
children
;
and
they
started
off
again
in
a
steamboat
this
blessed
afternoon
,
as
happy
to
be
along
with
each
other
as
if
they
were
going
to
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
they
was
,
pretty
straight
,
if
I
may
judge
from
the
poor
man
's
looks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
may
I
ask
,
"
said
Martin
,
glancing
,
but
not
with
any
displeasure
,
from
Mark
to
the
negro
,
"
who
this
gentleman
is
?
<EOS>
Another
friend
of
yours
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
,
taking
him
aside
,
and
speaking
confidentially
in
his
ear
,
"
he
's
a
man
of
colour
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
take
me
for
a
blind
man
,
"
asked
Martin
,
somewhat
impatiently
,
"
that
you
think
it
necessary
to
tell
me
that
,
when
his
face
is
the
blackest
that
ever
was
seen
?
"
   
"
No
,
no
;
when
I
say
a
man
of
colour
,
"
returned
Mark
,
"
<EOS>
I
mean
that
he
's
been
one
of
them
as
there
's
picters
of
in
the
shops
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
and
a
brother
,
you
know
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
favouring
his
master
with
a
significant
indication
of
the
figure
so
often
represented
in
tracts
and
cheap
prints
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
slave
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mark
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
A
slave
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
when
that
there
man
was
young
---
do
n't
look
at
him
while
I
'm
a
-
telling
it
---
he
was
shot
in
the
leg
;
gashed
in
the
arm
;
scored
in
his
live
limbs
,
like
crimped
fish
;
beaten
out
of
shape
;
had
his
neck
galled
with
an
iron
collar
,
and
wore
iron
rings
upon
his
wrists
and
ankles
.
<EOS>
The
marks
are
on
him
to
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
having
my
dinner
just
now
,
he
stripped
off
his
coat
,
and
took
away
my
appetite
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
THIS
true
?
"
asked
Martin
of
his
friend
,
who
stood
beside
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it
,
"
he
answered
,
shaking
his
head
"
It
very
often
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
I
know
it
is
,
from
hearing
his
whole
story
.
<EOS>
That
master
died
;
so
did
his
second
master
from
having
his
head
cut
open
with
a
hatchet
by
another
slave
,
who
,
when
he
'd
done
it
,
went
and
drowned
himself
;
then
he
got
a
better
one
;
in
years
and
years
he
saved
up
a
little
money
,
and
bought
his
freedom
,
which
he
got
pretty
cheap
at
last
,
on
account
of
his
strength
being
nearly
gone
,
and
he
being
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
he
's
a
-
saving
up
to
treat
himself
,
afore
he
dies
,
to
one
small
purchase
---
it
's
nothing
to
speak
of
.
 
<EOS>
Only
his
own
daughter
;
that
's
all
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Tapley
,
becoming
excited
.
 
<EOS>
"
Liberty
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
 
<EOS>
Hail
,
Columbia
!
"
   
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
clapping
his
hand
upon
his
mouth
;
"
and
do
n't
be
an
idiot
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
he
doing
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Waiting
to
take
our
luggage
off
upon
a
truck
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'd
have
come
for
it
by
-
and
-
bye
,
but
I
engaged
him
for
a
very
reasonable
charge
(
out
of
my
own
pocket
)
to
sit
along
with
me
and
make
me
jolly
;
and
I
am
jolly
;
and
if
I
was
rich
enough
to
contract
with
him
to
wait
upon
me
once
a
day
,
to
be
looked
at
,
I
'd
never
be
anything
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fact
may
cause
a
solemn
impeachment
of
Mark
's
veracity
,
but
it
must
be
admitted
nevertheless
,
that
there
was
that
in
his
face
and
manner
at
the
moment
,
which
militated
strongly
against
this
emphatic
declaration
of
his
state
of
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
love
you
,
sir
,
"
he
added
,
"
they
're
so
fond
of
Liberty
in
this
part
of
the
globe
,
that
they
buy
her
and
sell
her
and
carry
her
to
market
with
'em
.
 
<EOS>
They
've
such
a
passion
for
Liberty
,
that
they
ca
n't
help
taking
liberties
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
it
's
owing
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Martin
,
wishing
to
change
the
theme
.
 
<EOS>
"
Having
come
to
that
conclusion
,
Mark
,
perhaps
you
'll
attend
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
to
which
the
luggage
is
to
go
is
printed
on
this
card
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pawkins
's
Boarding
House
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Pawkins
's
boarding
-
house
,
"
repeated
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Cicero
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
his
name
?
"
asked
Martin
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
his
name
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
negro
grinning
assent
from
under
a
leathern
portmanteau
,
than
which
his
own
face
was
many
shades
deeper
,
hobbled
downstairs
with
his
portion
of
their
worldly
goods
;
Mark
Tapley
having
already
gone
before
with
his
share
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
and
his
friend
followed
them
to
the
door
below
,
and
were
about
to
pursue
their
walk
,
when
the
latter
stopped
,
and
asked
,
with
some
hesitation
,
whether
that
young
man
was
to
be
trusted
?
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
!
<EOS>
oh
certainly
!
<EOS>
with
anything
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
understand
me
<EOS>
---
I
think
he
had
better
go
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
an
honest
fellow
,
and
speaks
his
mind
so
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
"
said
Martin
,
smiling
,
"
that
being
unaccustomed
to
a
free
republic
,
he
is
used
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
had
better
go
with
us
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
get
into
some
trouble
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
a
slave
State
;
but
I
am
ashamed
to
say
that
a
spirit
of
Tolerance
is
not
so
common
anywhere
in
these
latitudes
as
the
form
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
remarkable
for
behaving
very
temperately
to
each
other
when
we
differ
;
but
to
strangers
!
<EOS>
no
,
I
really
think
he
had
better
go
with
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
called
to
him
immediately
to
be
of
their
party
;
so
Cicero
and
the
truck
went
one
way
,
and
they
three
went
another
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
about
the
city
for
two
or
three
hours
;
seeing
it
from
the
best
points
of
view
,
and
pausing
in
the
principal
streets
,
and
before
such
public
buildings
as
Mr
Bevan
pointed
out
.
 
<EOS>
Night
then
coming
on
apace
,
Martin
proposed
that
they
should
adjourn
to
Mrs
Pawkins
's
establishment
for
coffee
;
but
in
this
he
was
overruled
by
his
new
acquaintance
,
who
seemed
to
have
set
his
heart
on
carrying
him
,
though
it
were
only
for
an
hour
,
to
the
house
of
a
friend
of
his
who
lived
hard
by
.
 
<EOS>
Feeling
(
however
disinclined
he
was
,
being
weary
)
that
it
would
be
in
bad
taste
,
and
not
very
gracious
,
to
object
that
he
was
unintroduced
,
when
this
open
-
hearted
gentleman
was
so
ready
to
be
his
sponsor
,
Martin
---
for
once
in
his
life
,
at
all
events
---
sacrificed
his
own
will
and
pleasure
to
the
wishes
of
another
,
and
consented
with
a
fair
grace
.
 
<EOS>
So
travelling
had
done
him
that
much
good
,
already
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bevan
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
very
neat
house
of
moderate
size
,
from
the
parlour
windows
of
which
,
lights
were
shining
brightly
into
the
now
dark
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quickly
opened
by
a
man
with
such
a
thoroughly
Irish
face
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
ought
,
as
a
matter
of
right
and
principle
,
to
be
in
rags
,
and
could
have
no
sort
of
business
to
be
looking
cheerfully
at
anybody
out
of
a
whole
suit
of
clothes
.
   
<EOS>
Commending
Mark
to
the
care
of
this
phenomenon
---
for
such
he
may
be
said
to
have
been
in
Martin
's
eyes
---
<EOS>
Mr
Bevan
led
the
way
into
the
room
which
had
shed
its
cheerfulness
upon
the
street
,
to
whose
occupants
he
introduced
Mr
Chuzzlewit
as
a
gentleman
from
England
,
whose
acquaintance
he
had
recently
had
the
pleasure
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
They
gave
him
welcome
in
all
courtesy
and
politeness
;
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
'
time
he
found
himself
sitting
very
much
at
his
ease
by
the
fireside
,
and
becoming
vastly
well
acquainted
with
the
whole
family
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
two
young
ladies
---
one
eighteen
;
the
other
twenty
---
both
very
slender
,
but
very
pretty
;
their
mother
,
who
looked
,
as
Martin
thought
much
older
and
more
faded
than
she
ought
to
have
looked
;
and
their
grandmother
,
a
little
sharp
-
eyed
,
quick
old
woman
,
who
seemed
to
have
got
past
that
stage
,
and
to
have
come
all
right
again
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
the
young
ladies
'
father
,
and
the
young
ladies
'
brother
;
the
first
engaged
in
mercantile
affairs
;
the
second
,
a
student
at
college
;
both
,
in
a
certain
cordiality
of
manner
,
like
his
own
friend
,
and
not
unlike
him
in
face
.
 
<EOS>
Which
was
no
great
wonder
,
for
it
soon
appeared
that
he
was
their
near
relation
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
could
not
help
tracing
the
family
pedigree
from
the
two
young
ladies
,
because
they
were
foremost
in
his
thoughts
;
not
only
from
being
,
as
aforesaid
,
very
pretty
,
but
by
reason
of
their
wearing
miraculously
small
shoes
,
and
the
thinnest
possible
silk
stockings
;
the
which
their
rocking
-
chairs
developed
to
a
distracting
extent
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
a
monstrous
comfortable
circumstance
to
be
sitting
in
a
snug
,
well
-
furnished
room
,
warmed
by
a
cheerful
fire
,
and
full
of
various
pleasant
decorations
,
including
four
small
shoes
,
and
the
like
amount
of
silk
stockings
,
and
---
yes
,
why
not
?
---
<EOS>
the
feet
and
legs
therein
enshrined
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
is
no
doubt
that
Martin
was
monstrous
well
-
disposed
to
regard
his
position
in
that
light
,
after
his
recent
experience
of
the
Screw
,
and
of
Mrs
Pawkins
's
boarding
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
that
he
made
himself
very
agreeable
indeed
;
and
by
the
time
the
tea
and
coffee
arrived
(
with
sweet
preserves
,
and
cunning
tea
-
cakes
in
its
train
)
,
was
in
a
highly
genial
state
,
and
much
esteemed
by
the
whole
family
.
   
<EOS>
Another
delightful
circumstance
turned
up
before
the
first
cup
of
tea
was
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
family
had
been
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
pleasant
thing
!
 
<EOS>
But
Martin
was
not
quite
so
glad
of
this
,
when
he
found
that
they
knew
all
the
great
dukes
,
lords
,
viscounts
,
marquesses
,
duchesses
,
knights
,
and
baronets
,
quite
affectionately
,
and
were
beyond
everything
interested
in
the
least
particular
concerning
them
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
when
they
asked
,
after
the
wearer
of
this
or
that
coronet
,
and
said
,
"
Was
he
quite
well
?
"
<EOS>
Martin
answered
,
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
oh
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Never
better
;
"
and
when
they
said
,
"
his
lordship
's
mother
,
the
duchess
,
was
she
much
changed
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Martin
said
,
"
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
,
they
would
know
her
anywhere
,
if
they
saw
her
to
-
morrow
;
"
and
so
got
on
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
In
like
manner
when
the
young
ladies
questioned
him
touching
the
Gold
Fish
in
that
Grecian
fountain
in
such
and
such
a
nobleman
's
conservatory
,
and
whether
there
were
as
many
as
there
used
to
be
,
he
gravely
reported
,
after
mature
consideration
,
that
there
must
be
at
least
twice
as
many
;
and
as
to
the
exotics
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
it
was
of
no
use
talking
about
THEM
;
they
must
be
seen
to
be
believed
;
"
which
improved
state
of
circumstances
reminded
the
family
of
the
splendour
of
that
brilliant
festival
(
comprehending
the
whole
British
Peerage
and
Court
Calendar
)
to
which
they
were
specially
invited
,
and
which
indeed
had
been
partly
given
in
their
honour
;
and
recollections
of
what
Mr
Norris
the
father
had
said
to
the
marquess
,
and
of
what
Mrs
Norris
the
mother
had
said
to
the
marchioness
,
and
of
what
the
marquess
and
marchioness
had
both
said
,
when
they
said
that
upon
their
words
and
honours
they
wished
Mr
Norris
the
father
and
Mrs
Norris
the
mother
,
and
the
Misses
Norris
the
daughters
,
and
Mr
Norris
Junior
,
the
son
,
would
only
take
up
their
permanent
residence
in
England
,
and
give
them
the
pleasure
of
their
everlasting
friendship
,
occupied
a
very
considerable
time
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
thought
it
rather
stange
,
and
in
some
sort
inconsistent
,
that
during
the
whole
of
these
narrations
,
and
in
the
very
meridian
of
their
enjoyment
thereof
,
both
Mr
Norris
the
father
,
and
Mr
Norris
Junior
,
the
son
(
who
corresponded
,
every
post
,
with
four
members
of
the
English
Peerage
)
,
enlarged
upon
the
inestimable
advantage
of
having
no
such
arbitrary
distinctions
in
that
enlightened
land
,
where
there
were
no
noblemen
but
nature
's
noblemen
,
and
where
all
society
was
based
on
one
broad
level
of
brotherly
love
and
natural
equality
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mr
Norris
the
father
gradually
expanding
into
an
oration
on
this
swelling
theme
,
was
becoming
tedious
,
when
Mr
Bevan
diverted
his
thoughts
by
happening
to
make
some
causal
inquiry
relative
to
the
occupier
of
the
next
house
;
in
reply
to
which
,
this
same
Mr
Norris
the
father
observed
,
that
"
that
person
entertained
religious
opinions
of
which
he
could
n't
approve
;
and
therefore
he
had
n't
the
honour
of
knowing
the
gentleman
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Norris
the
mother
added
another
reason
of
her
own
,
the
same
in
effect
,
but
varying
in
words
;
to
wit
,
that
she
believed
the
people
were
well
enough
in
their
way
,
but
they
were
not
genteel
.
   
<EOS>
Another
little
trait
came
out
,
which
impressed
itself
on
Martin
forcibly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bevan
told
them
about
Mark
and
the
negro
,
and
then
it
appeared
that
all
the
Norrises
were
abolitionists
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
relief
to
hear
this
,
and
Martin
was
so
much
encouraged
on
finding
himself
in
such
company
,
that
he
expressed
his
sympathy
with
the
oppressed
and
wretched
blacks
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
one
of
the
young
ladies
---
the
prettiest
and
most
delicate
---
was
mightily
amused
at
the
earnestness
with
which
he
spoke
;
and
on
his
craving
leave
to
ask
her
why
,
was
quite
unable
for
a
time
to
speak
for
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
however
as
she
could
,
she
told
him
that
the
negroes
were
such
a
funny
people
,
so
excessively
ludicrous
in
their
manners
and
appearance
,
that
it
was
wholly
impossible
for
those
who
knew
them
well
,
to
associate
any
serious
ideas
with
such
a
very
absurd
part
of
the
creation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Norris
the
father
,
and
Mrs
Norris
the
mother
,
and
Miss
Norris
the
sister
,
and
Mr
Norris
Junior
the
brother
,
and
even
Mrs
Norris
Senior
the
grandmother
,
were
all
of
this
opinion
,
and
laid
it
down
as
an
absolute
matter
of
fact
---
as
if
there
were
nothing
in
suffering
and
slavery
,
grim
enough
to
cast
a
solemn
air
on
any
human
animal
;
though
it
were
as
ridiculous
,
physically
,
as
the
most
grotesque
of
apes
,
or
morally
,
as
the
mildest
Nimrod
among
tuft
-
hunting
republicans
!
   
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
"
said
Mr
Norris
the
father
,
settling
the
question
comfortably
,
"
there
is
a
natural
antipathy
between
the
races
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Extending
,
"
said
Martin
's
friend
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
to
the
cruellest
of
tortures
,
and
the
bargain
and
sale
of
unborn
generations
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Norris
the
son
said
nothing
,
but
he
made
a
wry
face
,
and
dusted
his
fingers
as
Hamlet
might
after
getting
rid
of
Yorick
's
skull
;
just
as
though
he
had
that
moment
touched
a
negro
,
and
some
of
the
black
had
come
off
upon
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
In
order
that
their
talk
might
fall
again
into
its
former
pleasant
channel
,
Martin
dropped
the
subject
,
with
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
it
would
be
a
dangerous
theme
to
revive
under
the
best
of
circumstances
;
and
again
addressed
himself
to
the
young
ladies
,
who
were
very
gorgeously
attired
in
very
beautiful
colours
,
and
had
every
article
of
dress
on
the
same
extensive
scale
as
the
little
shoes
and
the
thin
silk
stockings
.
 
<EOS>
This
suggested
to
him
that
they
were
great
proficients
in
the
French
fashions
,
which
soon
turned
out
to
be
the
case
,
for
though
their
information
appeared
to
be
none
of
the
newest
,
it
was
very
extensive
;
and
the
eldest
sister
in
particular
,
who
was
distinguished
by
a
talent
for
metaphysics
,
the
laws
of
hydraulic
pressure
,
and
the
rights
of
human
kind
,
had
a
novel
way
of
combining
these
acquirements
and
bringing
them
to
bear
on
any
subject
from
Millinery
to
the
Millennium
,
both
inclusive
,
which
was
at
once
improving
and
remarkable
;
so
much
so
,
in
short
,
that
it
was
usually
observed
to
reduce
foreigners
to
a
state
of
temporary
insanity
in
five
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
felt
his
reason
going
;
and
as
a
means
of
saving
himself
,
besought
the
other
sister
(
seeing
a
piano
in
the
room
)
to
sing
.
<EOS>
With
this
request
she
willingly
complied
;
and
a
bravura
concert
,
solely
sustained
by
the
Misses
Noriss
,
presently
began
.
 
<EOS>
They
sang
in
all
languages
---
except
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
German
,
French
,
Italian
,
Spanish
,
Portuguese
,
Swiss
;
but
nothing
native
;
nothing
so
low
as
native
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
in
this
respect
,
languages
are
like
many
other
travellers
---
ordinary
and
commonplace
enough
at
home
,
but
"
specially
genteel
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
little
doubt
that
in
course
of
time
the
Misses
Norris
would
have
come
to
Hebrew
,
if
they
had
not
been
interrupted
by
an
announcement
from
the
Irishman
,
who
,
flinging
open
the
door
,
cried
in
a
loud
voice
---
    
"
Jiniral
Fladdock
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
!
"
cried
the
sisters
,
desisting
suddenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
general
come
back
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
they
made
the
exclamation
,
the
general
,
attired
in
full
uniform
for
a
ball
,
came
darting
in
with
such
precipitancy
that
,
hitching
his
boot
in
the
carpet
,
and
getting
his
sword
between
his
legs
,
he
came
down
headlong
,
and
presented
a
curious
little
bald
place
on
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
company
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
the
worst
of
it
;
for
being
rather
corpulent
and
very
tight
,
the
general
being
down
,
could
not
get
up
again
,
but
lay
there
writing
and
doing
such
things
with
his
boots
,
as
there
is
no
other
instance
of
in
military
history
.
   
<EOS>
Of
course
there
was
an
immediate
rush
to
his
assistance
;
and
the
general
was
promptly
raised
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
uniform
was
so
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
,
that
he
came
up
stiff
and
without
a
bend
in
him
like
a
dead
Clown
,
and
had
no
command
<EOS>
whatever
of
himself
until
he
was
put
quite
flat
upon
the
soles
of
his
feet
,
when
he
became
animated
as
by
a
miracle
,
and
moving
edgewise
that
he
might
go
in
a
narrower
compass
and
be
in
less
danger
of
fraying
the
gold
lace
on
his
epaulettes
by
brushing
them
against
anything
,
advanced
with
a
smiling
visage
to
salute
the
lady
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
family
to
testify
purer
delight
and
joy
than
at
this
unlooked
-
for
appearance
of
General
Fladdock
!
 
<EOS>
The
general
was
as
warmly
received
as
if
New
York
had
been
in
a
state
of
siege
and
no
other
general
was
to
be
got
for
love
or
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
shook
hands
with
the
Norrises
three
times
all
round
,
and
then
reviewed
them
from
a
little
distance
as
a
brave
commander
might
,
with
his
ample
cloak
drawn
forward
over
the
right
shoulder
and
thrown
back
upon
the
left
side
to
reveal
his
manly
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
do
I
then
,
"
cried
the
general
,
"
once
again
behold
the
choicest
spirits
of
my
country
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Norris
the
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
we
are
,
general
.
"
   
<EOS>
Then
all
the
Norrises
pressed
round
the
general
,
inquiring
how
and
where
he
had
been
since
the
date
of
his
letter
,
and
how
he
had
enjoyed
himself
in
foreign

and
particularly
and
above
all
,
to
what
extent
he
had
become
acquainted
with
the
great
dukes
,
lords
,
viscounts
,
marquesses
,
duchesses
,
knights
,
and
baronets

in
whom
the
people
of
those
benighted
countries
had
delight

<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
do
n't
ask
me
,
"
said
the
general
,
holding
up
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
among
'em
all
the
time
,
and
have
got
public
journals
in
my
trunk
with
my
name
printed
"
---
he
lowered
his
voice
and
was
very
impressive
here
---
"
among
the
fashionable
news
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
oh
,
the
conventionalities
of
that
a
-
mazing
Europe
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
cried
Mr
Norris
the
father
,
giving
his
head
a
melancholy
shake
,
and
looking
towards
Martin
as
though
he
would
say
,
"
I
ca
n't
deny
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
limited
diffusion
of
a
moral
sense
in
that
country
!
"
exclaimed
the
general
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
absence
of
a
moral
dignity
in
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
sighed
all
the
Norrises
,
quite
overwhelmed
with
despondency
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
have
realised
it
,
"
pursued
the
general
,
"
without
being
located
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Norris
,
your
imagination
is
the
imagination
of
a
strong
man
,
but
YOU
could
n't
have
realised
it
,
without
being
located
on
the
spot
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
said
Mr
Norris
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
ex
-
clusiveness
,
the
pride
,
the
form
,
the
ceremony
,
"
exclaimed
the
general
,
emphasizing
the
article
more
vigorously
at
every
repetition
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
artificial
barriers
set
up
between
man
and
man
;
the
division
of
the
human
race
into
court
cards
and
plain
cards
,
of
every
denomination
---
into
clubs
,
diamonds
,
spades
---
anything
but
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
cried
the
whole
family
.
 
<EOS>
"
Too
true
,
general
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
stay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Norris
the
father
,
taking
him
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
crossed
in
the
Screw
,
general
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
so
I
did
,
"
was
the
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Possible
!
"
cried
the
young
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
general
seemed
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
his
having
come
home
in
the
Screw
should
occasion
such
a
sensation
,
nor
did
he
seem
at
all
clearer
on
the
subject
when
Mr
Norris
,
introducing
him
to
Martin
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
A
fellow
-
passenger
of
yours
<EOS>
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Of
mine
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
general
;
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
never
seen
Martin
,
but
Martin
had
seen
him
,
and
recognized
him
,
now
that
they
stood
face
to
face
,
as
the
gentleman
who
had
stuck
his
hands
in
his
pockets
towards
the
end
of
the
voyage
,
and
walked
the
deck
with
his
nostrils
dilated
.
   
<EOS>
Everybody
looked
at
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
help
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
must
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
over
in
the
same
ship
as
the
general
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
but
not
in
the
same
cabin
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
necessary
for
me
to
observe
strict
economy
,
I
took
my
passage
in
the
steerage
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
the
general
had
been
carried
up
bodily
to
a
loaded
cannon
,
and
required
to
let
it
off
that
moment
,
he
could
not
have
been
in
a
state
of
greater
consternation
than
when
he
heard
these
words
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
Fladdock
---
Fladdock
in
full
militia
uniform
,
Fladdock
<EOS>
the
General
,
Fladdock
,
the
caressed
of
foreign
noblemen
---
expected
to
know
a
fellow
who
had
come
over
in
the
steerage
of
line
-
of
-
packet
ship
,
at
the
cost
of
four
pound
ten
!
 
<EOS>
And
meeting
that
fellow
in
the
very
sanctuary
of
New
York
fashion
,
and
nestling
in
the
bosom
of
the
New
York
aristocracy
!
 
<EOS>
He
almost
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
.
   
<EOS>
A
death
-
like
stillness
fell
upon
the
Norisses
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
story
should
get
wind
,
their
country
relation
had
,
by
his
imprudence
,
for
ever
disgraced
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
the
bright
particular
stars
of
an
exalted
New
York
sphere
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
other
fashionable
spheres
above
them
,
and
other
fashionable
spheres
below
,
and
none
of
the
stars
in
any
one
of
these
spheres
had
anything
to
say
to
the
stars
in
any
other
of
these
spheres
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
through
all
the
spheres
it
would
go
forth
that
the
Norrises
,
deceived
by
gentlemanly
manners
and
appearances
,
had
,
falling
from
their
high
estate
,
"
received
"
a
dollarless
and
unknown
man
.
 
<EOS>
O
guardian
eagle
of
the
pure
Republic
,
had
they
lived
for
this
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
allow
me
,
"
said
Martin
,
after
a
terrible
silence
,
"
to
take
my
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
am
the
cause
of
at
least
as
much
embarrassment
here
,
as
I
have
brought
upon
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
bound
,
before
I
go
,
to
exonerate
this
gentleman
,
who
,
in
introducing
me
to
such
society
,
was
quite
ignorant
of
my
unworthiness
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
made
his
bow
to
the
Norrises
,
and
walked
out
like
a
man
of
snow
;
very
cool
externally
,
but
pretty
hot
within
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
Mr
Norris
the
father
,
looking
with
a
pale
face
on
the
assembled
circle
as
Martin
closed
the
door
<EOS>
,
"
the
young
man
has
this
night
beheld
a
refinement
of
social
manner
,
and
an
easy
magnificence
of
social
decoration
,
to
which
he
is
a
stranger
in
his
own
country
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
it
may
awake
a
moral
sense
within
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
that
peculiarly
transatlantic
article
,
a
moral
sense
---
for
,
if
native
statesmen
,
orators
,
and
pamphleteers
,
are
to
be
believed
,
America
quite
monopolises
the
commodity
---
if
that
peculiarly
transatlantic
article
be
supposed
to
include
a
benevolent
love
of
all
mankind
,
certainly
Martin
's
would
have
borne
,
just
then
,
<EOS>
a
deal
of
waking
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
strode
along
the
street
,
with
Mark
at
his
heels
,
his
immoral
sense
was
in
active
operation
;
prompting
him
to
the
utterance
of
some
rather
sanguinary
remarks
,
which
it
was
well
for
his
own
credit
that
nobody
overheard
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
so
far
cooled
down
,
however
,
that
he
had
begun
to
laugh
at
the
recollection
of
these
incidents
,
when
he
heard
another
step
behind
him
,
and
turning
round
encountered
his
friend
Bevan
,
quite
out
of
breath
.
   
<EOS>
He
drew
his
arm
through
Martin
's
,
and
entreating
him
to
walk
slowly
,
was
silent
for
some
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
exonerate
me
in
another
sense
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
acquit
me
of
intending
or
foreseeing
the
termination
of
our
visit
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
scarcely
need
ask
you
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Scarcely
indeed
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
more
beholden
to
you
for
your
kindness
,
when
I
find
what
kind
of
stuff
the
good
citizens
here
are
made
of
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
reckon
,
"
his
friend
returned
,
"
that
they
are
made
of
pretty
much
the
same
stuff
as
other
folks
,
if
they
would
but
own
it
,
and
not
set
up
on
false
pretences
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
good
faith
,
that
's
true
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
"
resumed
his
friend
,
"
you
might
have
such
a
scene
as
that
in
an
English
comedy
,
and
not
detect
any
gross
improbability
or
anomaly
in
the
matter
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Doubtless
it
is
more
ridiculous
here
than
anywhere
else
,
"
said
his
companion
;
"
but
our
professions
are
to
blame
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
as
I
myself
am
concerned
,
I
may
add
that
I
was
perfectly
aware
from
the
first
that
you
came
over
in
the
steerage
,
for
I
had
seen
the
list
of
passengers
,
and
knew
it
did
not
comprise
your
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
more
obliged
to
you
than
before
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Norris
is
a
very
good
fellow
in
his
way
,
"
observed
Mr
Bevan
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
?
"
said
Martin
drily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
there
are
a
hundred
good
points
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
or
anybody
else
addressed
him
as
another
order
of
being
,
and
sued
to
him
IN
FORMA
PAUPERIS
,
he
would
be
all
kindness
and
consideration
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
need
n't
have
travelled
three
thousand
miles
from
home
to
find
such
a
character
as
THAT
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
he
nor
his
friend
said
anything
more
on
the
way
back
;
each
appearing
to
find
sufficient
occupation
in
his
own
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
The
tea
,
or
the
supper
,
or
whatever
else
<EOS>
they
called
the
evening
meal
,
was
over
when
they
reached
the
Major
's
;
but
the
cloth
,
ornamented
with
a
few
additional
smears
and
stains
,
was
still
upon
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
end
of
the
board
Mrs
Jefferson
Brick
and
two
other
ladies
were
drinking
tea
;
out
of
the
ordinary
course
,
evidently
,
for
they
were
bonneted
and
shawled
,
and
seemed
to
have
just
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
light
of
three
flaring
candles
of
different
lengths
,
in
as
many
candlesticks
of
different
patterns
,
the
room
showed
to
almost
as
little
advantage
as
in
broad
day
.
   
<EOS>
These
ladies
were
all
three
talking
together
in
a
very
loud
tone
when
Martin
and
his
friend
entered
;
but
seeing
those
gentlemen
,
they
stopped
directly
,
and
became
excessively
genteel
,
not
to
say
frosty
.
<EOS>
As
they
went
on
to
exchange
some
few
remarks
in
whispers
,
the
very
water
in
the
teapot
might
have
fallen
twenty
degrees
in
temperature
beneath
their
chilling
coldness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
to
meeting
,
Mrs
Brick
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Martin
's
friend
,
with
something
of
a
roguish
twinkle
in
his
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
lecture
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
go
to
meeting
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
lady
on
the
right
of
Mrs
Brick
gave
a
pious
cough
as
much
as
to
say
"
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
---
as
,
indeed
,
she
did
nearly
every
night
in
the
week
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
good
discourse
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mr
Bevan
,
addressing
this
lady
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
raised
her
eyes
in
a
pious
manner
,
and
answered
"
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
much
comforted
by
some
good
,
strong
,
peppery
doctrine
,
which
satisfactorily
disposed
of
all
her
friends
and
acquaintances
,
and
quite
settled
their
business
.
 
<EOS>
Her
bonnet
,
too
,
had
far
outshone
every
bonnet
in
the
congregation
;
so
she
was
tranquil
on
all
accounts
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
course
of
lectures
are
you
attending
now
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Martin
's
friend
,
turning
again
to
Mrs
Brick
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Philosophy
of
the
Soul
,
on
Wednesdays
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
Mondays
?
"
   
"
The
Philosophy
of
Crime
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
Fridays
?
"
   
"
The
Philosophy
of
Vegetables
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
forgotten
Thursdays
;
the
Philosophy
of
Government
,
my
dear
,
"
observed
the
third
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mrs
Brick
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
Tuesdays
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
!
"
cried
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Philosophy
of
Matter
on
Thursdays
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
our
ladies
are
fully
employed
,
"
said
Bevan
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
have
reason
to
say
so
,
"
answered
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Between
these
very
grave
pursuits
abroad
,
and
family
duties
at
home
,
their
time
must
be
pretty
well
engrossed
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
stopped
here
,
for
he
saw
that
the
ladies
regarded
him
with
no
very
great
favour
,
though
what
he
had
done
to
deserve
the
disdainful
expression
which
appeared
in
their
faces
<EOS>
he
was
at
a
loss
to
divine
.
<EOS>
But
on
their
going
upstairs
to
their
bedrooms
---
which
they
very
soon
did
---
Mr
Bevan
informed
him
that
domestic
drudgery
was
far
beneath
the
exalted
range
of
these
Philosophers
,
and
that
the
chances
were
a
hundred
to
one
that
not
one
of
the
three
could
perform
the
easiest
woman
's
work
for
herself
,
or
make
the
simplest
article
of
dress
for
any
of
her
children
.
   
<EOS>
"
Though
whether
they
might
not
be
better
employed
with
such
blunt
instruments
as
knitting
-
needles
than
with
these
edge
-
tools
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
another
question
;
but
I
can
answer
for
one
thing
---
they
do
n't
often
cut
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Devotions
and
lectures
are
our
balls
and
concerts
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
to
these
places
of
resort
,
as
an
escape
from
monotony
;
look
at
each
other
's
clothes
;
and
come
home
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
say
"
home
,
"
do
you
mean
a
house
like
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
often
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
see
you
are
tired
to
death
,
and
will
wish
you
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
discuss
your
projects
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
but
feel
already
that
it
is
useless
staying
here
,
with
any
hope
of
advancing
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
go
further
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
to
fare
worse
?
"
said
Martin
,
pursuing
the
old
adage
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
sufficient
for
the
day
<EOS>
,
you
know
---
good
night
<EOS>
"
   
They
shook
hands
heartily
and
separated
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Martin
was
left
alone
,
the
excitement
of
novelty
and
change
which
had
sustained
him
through
all
the
fatigues
of
the
day
,
departed
;
and
he
felt
so
thoroughly
dejected
and
worn
out
,
that
he
even
lacked
the
energy
to
crawl
upstairs
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
In
twelve
or
fifteen
hours
,
how
great
a
change
had
fallen
on
his
hopes
and
sanguine
plans
!
 
<EOS>
New
and
strange
as
he
was
to
the
ground
on
which
he
stood
,
and
to
the
air
he
breathed
,
he
could
not
---
 
recalling
all
that
he
had
crowded
into
that
one
day
---
but
entertain
a
strong
misgiving
that
his
enterprise
was
doomed
.
 
<EOS>
Rash
and
ill
-
considered
as
it
had
often
looked
on
shipboard
,
but
had
never
seemed
on
shore
<EOS>
,
it
wore
a
dismal
aspect
,
now
,
that
frightened
him
.
<EOS>
Whatever
thoughts
he
called
up
to
his
aid
,
they
came
upon
him
in
depressing
and
discouraging
shapes
,
and
gave
him
no
relief
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
diamonds
on
his
finger
sparkled
with
the
brightness
of
tears
,
and
had
no
ray
of
hope
in
all
their
brilliant
lustre
.
   
<EOS>
He
continued
to
sit
in
gloomy
rumination
by
the
stove
,
unmindful
of
the
boarders
who
dropped
in
one
by
one
from
their
stores
and
counting
-
houses
,
or
the
neighbouring
bar
-
rooms
,
and
,
after
taking
long
pulls
from
a
great
white
waterjug
upon
the
sideboard
,
and
lingering
with
a
kind
of
hideous
fascination
near
the
brass
spittoons
,
lounged
heavily
to
bed
;
until
at
length
Mark
Tapley
came
and
shook
him
by
the
arm
,
supposing
him
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
starting
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
sir
,
"
said
that
cheerful
follower
,
snuffing
with
his
fingers
the
candle
he
bore
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
a
very
large
bed
,
your'n
,
sir
;
and
a
man
as
was
n't
thirsty
might
drink
,
afore
breakfast
,
all
the
water
you
've
got
to
wash
in
,
and
afterwards
eat
the
towel
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
sleep
without
rocking
to
-
night
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
as
if
the
house
were
on
the
sea
"
said
Martin
,
staggering
when
he
rose
;
"
and
am
utterly
wretched
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
as
jolly
as
a
sandboy
,
myself
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
Lord
,
I
have
reason
to
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
been
born
here
;
that
's
my
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
how
you
go
"
<EOS>
---
for
they
were
now
ascending
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
the
gentleman
aboard
the
Screw
as
had
the
very
small
trunk
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
valise
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
there
's
been
a
delivery
of
clean
clothes
from
the
wash
to
-
night
,
and
they
're
put
outside
the
bedroom
doors
here
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
take
notice
as
we
go
up
,
what
a
very
few
shirts
there
are
,
and
what
a
many
fronts
<EOS>
,
you
'll
penetrate
the
mystery
of
his
packing
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
Martin
was
too
weary
and
despondent
to
take
heed
of
anything
,
so
had
no
interest
in
this
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
,
nothing
dashed
by
his
indifference
,
conducted
him
to
the
top
of
the
house
,
and
into
the
bed
-
chamber
prepared
for
his
reception
;
which
was
a
very
little
narrow
room
,
with
half
a
window
in
it
;
a
bedstead
like
a
chest
without
a
lid
;
two
chairs
;
<EOS>
a
piece
of
carpet
,
such
as
shoes
are
commonly
tried
upon
at
a
ready
-
made
establishment
in
England
;
a
little
looking
-
glass
nailed
against
the
wall
;
and
a
washing
-
table
,
with
a
jug
and
ewer
,
that
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
milk
-
pot
and
slop
-
basin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
polish
themselves
with
a
dry
cloth
in
this
country
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
've
certainly
got
a
touch
of
the
"
phoby
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
pull
off
my
boots
for
me
,
"
said
Martin
,
dropping
into
one
of
the
chairs
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
knocked
up
---
<EOS>
dead
beat
,
Mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
say
that
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
morning
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Tapley
;
"
nor
even
to
-
night
,
sir
,
when
you
've
made
a
trial
of
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
which
he
produced
a
very
large
tumbler
,
piled
up
to
the
brim
with
little
blocks
of
clear
transparent
ice
,
through
which
one
or
two
thin
slices
of
lemon
,
and
a
golden
liquid
of
delicious
appearance
,
appealed
from
the
still
depths
below
,
to
the
loving
eye
of
the
spectator
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
this
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
But
Mr
Tapley
made
no
answer
;
merely
plunging
a
reed
into
the
mixture
---
which
caused
a
pleasant
commotion
among
the
pieces
of
ice
---
 
and
signifying
by
an
expressive
gesture
that
it
was
to
be
pumped
up
through
that
agency
by
the
enraptured
drinker
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
took
the
glass
with
an
astonished
look
;
applied
his
lips
to
the
reed
;
and
cast
up
his
eyes
once
in
ecstasy
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
no
more
until
the
goblet
was
drained
to
the
last
drop
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
sir
!
"
said
Mark
,
taking
it
from
him
with
a
triumphant
face
;
"
if
ever
you
should
happen
to
be
dead
beat
again
,
when
I
ai
n't
in
the
way
,
all
you
've
got
to
do
is
to
ask
the
nearest
man
to
go
and
fetch
a
cobbler
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
go
and
fetch
a
cobbler
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
wonderful
invention
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
tenderly
patting
the
empty
glass
,
"
is
called
a
cobbler
.
 
<EOS>
Sherry
cobbler
when
you
name
it
long
;
cobbler
,
when
you
name
it
short
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
're
equal
to
having
your
boots
took
off
,
and
are
,
in
every
particular
worth
mentioning
,
another
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
delivered
himself
of
this
solemn
preface
,
he
brought
the
bootjack
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
relapse
,
Mark
,
"
said
Martin
;
"
but
,
good
Heaven
,
if
we
should
be
left
in
some
wild
part
of
this
country
without
goods
or
money
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
"
replied
the
imperturbable
Tapley
;
"
from
what
we
've
seen
already
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
,
under
those
circumstances
,
we
should
n't
do
better
in
the
wild
parts
than
in
the
tame
ones
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Tom
Pinch
,
Tom
Pinch
!
"
<EOS>
said
Martin
,
in
a
thoughtful
tone
;
"
what
would
I
give
to
be
again
beside
you
,
and
able
to
hear
your
voice
,
though
it
were
even
in
the
old
bedroom
at
Pecksniff
's
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Dragon
,
Dragon
!
"
echoed
Mark
,
cheerfully
,
"
if
there
warn't
<EOS>
any
water
between
you
and
me
,
and
nothing
faint
-
hearted
-
like
in
going
back
,
I
do
n't
know
that
I
might
n't
say
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
am
I
,
Dragon
,
in
New
York
,
America
;
and
there
are
you
in
Wiltshire
,
Europe
;
and
there
's
a
fortune
to
make
,
Dragon
,
and
a
beautiful
young
lady
to
make
it
for
;
and
whenever
you
go
to
see
the
Monument

Dragon
,
you
must
n't
give
in
on
the
doorsteps
,
or
you
'll
never
get
up
to
the
top
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wisely
said
,
Mark
,
"
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
look
forward
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
all
the
story
-
books
as
ever
I
read
,
sir
,
the
people
as
looked
backward
was
turned
into
stones
,
"
replied
Mark
;
"
and
my
opinion
always
was
,
that
they
brought
it
on
themselves
,
and
it
served
'em
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
night
,
sir
,
and
pleasant
dreams
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
must
be
of
home
,
then
,
"
said
Martin
,
as
he
lay
down
in
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
say
,
too
,
"
whispered
Mark
Tapley
,
when
he
was
out
of
hearing
and
in
his
own
room
;
"
for
if
there
do
n't
come
a
time
afore
we
're
well
out
of
this
,
when
there
'll
be
a
little
more
credit
in
keeping
up
one
's
jollity
,
I
'm
a
United
Statesman

<EOS>
Leaving
them
to
blend
and
mingle
in
their
sleep
the
shadows
of
objects
afar
off
,
as
they
take
fantastic
shapes
upon
the
wall
in
the
dim
light
of
thought
without
control
,
be
it
the
part
of
this
slight
chronicle

a
dream
within
a
dream

as
rapidly
to
change
the
scene

and
cross
the

Nothing

If
a
man
habituated
to
a
narrow
circle
of
cares
and
pleasures
,
out
of
which
he
seldom
travels
,
step
beyond
it
,
though
for
never
so
brief
a
space
,
his
departure
from
the
monotonous
scene
on
which
he
has
been
an
actor
of
importance
,
would
seem
to
be
the
signal
for
instant
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
,
in
the
gap
he
had
left
,
the
wedge
of
change
were
driven
to
the
head
,
rending
what
was
a
solid
mass
to
fragments
,
things
cemented
and
held
together
by
the
usages
of
years
,
burst
asunder
in

many
weeks

The
mine
which
Time

dug
beneath
familiar
objects
is
sprung
in
an
instant
;
and
what
was
rock

becomes
but
sand
and
dust
.
   
<EOS>
Most
men

at

or
other

have
proved
this
in
some
degree

The
extent
to
which
the
natural
laws
of
change
asserted

<EOS>
"
What
a

it

"
<EOS>
whimpered
old
Anthony
,
drawing
near
the
evening
fire
,
"
It
was
a
warmer
season
,
sure
,
when
I
was
young

<EOS>
"
You

go
scorching
your
clothes
into
holes

whether
it

observed
the
amiable
Jonas
,
raising
his
eyes
from
yesterday

cried
the

breathing
on
his

and
feebly
chafing
them
against

"
A

<EOS>

I
do

know

I
would

mind
you

if
I
could
do
it

nothing

said
his
son
,
as
he
resumed
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
chuckled
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
IF

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
it
's
very
cold

<EOS>
"
Let

"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Jonas
,
stopping
his
honoured
parent
's
hand
in
the
use
of
the
poker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
come
to
want
in
your
old
age
,
that
you
take
to
wasting
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
not

for
that
,
Jonas
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
time
for
what
?
"
bawled
his
heir
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
me
to
come
to
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
there
was
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
always
were
as
selfish
an
old
blade
as
need
be
,
"
said
Jonas
in
a
voice
too
low
for
him
to
hear
,
and
looking
at
him
with
an
angry
frown
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
act
up
to
your
character
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
mind
coming
to
want
,
would
n't
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
would
n't
.
 
<EOS>
And
your
own
flesh
and
blood
might
come
to
want
too
,
<EOS>
might
they
,
for
anything
you
cared
?
<EOS>
Oh
you
precious
old
flint
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
this
dutiful
address
he
took
his
tea
-
cup
in
his
hand
---
for
that
meal
was
in
progress
,
and
the
father
and
son
and
Chuffey
were
partakers
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
looking
steadfastly
at
his
father
,
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
carry
a
spoonful
of
tea
to
his
lips
,
he
proceeded
in
the
same
tone
,
thus
:
   
"
Want
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
nice
old
man
to
be
talking
of
want
at
this
time
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
Beginning
to
talk
of
want
,
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
declare
!
<EOS>
There
is
n't
time
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
should
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'd
live
to
be
a
couple
of
hundred
if
you
could
;
and
after
all
be
discontented
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
sighed
,
and
still
sat
cowering
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
shook
his
Britannia
-
metal
teaspoon
at
him
,
and
taking
a
loftier
position
,
went
on
to
argue
the
point
on
high
moral
grounds
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
in
such
a
state
of
mind
as
that
,
"
he
grumbled
,
but
in
the
same
subdued
key
,
"
why
do
n't
you
make
over
your
property
?
 
<EOS>
Buy
an
annuity
cheap
,
and
make
your
life
interesting
to
yourself
and
everybody
else
that
watches
the
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
,
that
would
n't
suit
YOU
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
be
natural
conduct
to
your
own
son
,
and
you
like
to
be
unnatural
,
and
to
keep
him
out
of
his
rights
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
should
be
ashamed
of
myself
if
I
was
you
,
and
glad
to
hide
my
head
in
the
what
you
may
call
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Possibly
this
general
phrase
supplied
the
place
of
grave
,
or
tomb
,
or
sepulchre
,
or
cemetery
,
or
mausoleum
,
or
other
such
word
which
the
filial
tenderness
of
Mr
Jonas
made
him
delicate
of
pronouncing
.
<EOS>
He
pursued
the
theme
no
further
;
for
Chuffey
,
somehow
discovering
,
from
his
old
corner
by
the
fireside
,
that
Anthony
was
in
the
attitude
of
a
listener
,
and
that
Jonas
appeared
to
be
speaking
,
suddenly
cried
out
,
like
one
inspired
:
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
your
own
son
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
Your
own
son
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Chuffey
little
suspected
what
depth
of
application
these
words
had
,
or
that
,
in
the
bitter
satire
which
they
bore
,
they
might
have
sunk
into
the
old
man
's
very
soul
,
could
he
have
known
what
words
here
hanging
on
his
own
son
's
lips
,
or
what
was
passing
in
his
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
voice
diverted
the
current
of
Anthony
's
reflections
,
and
roused
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
Chuffey
,
Jonas
is
a
chip
of
the
old
block
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
old
block
,
now
,
Chuffey
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
with
a
strange
look
of
discomposure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Precious
old
,
"
assented
Jonas
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
Not
old
at
all
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
worse
than
ever
,
you
know
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
quite
disgusted
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
,
father
,
he
's
getting
too
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
says
you
're
wrong
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Anthony
to
the
old
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
!
<EOS>
"
was
Chuffey
's
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
HE
'S
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
HE
'S
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
So
are
you
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
---
a
kind
of
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
quite
a
boy
to
many
I
have
known
;
you
're
a
boy
to
me
;
you
're
a
boy
to
hundreds
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
which
extraordinary
speech
---
for
in
the
case
of
Chuffey
this
was
a
burst
of
eloquence
without
a
parallel
---
the
poor
old
shadow
drew
through
his
palsied
arm
his
master
's
hand
,
and
held
it
there
,
with
his
own
folded
upon
it
,
as
if
he
would
defend
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
grow
deafer
every
day
,
Chuff
,
"
said
Anthony
,
with
as
much
softness
of
manner
,
or
,
to
describe
it
more
correctly
,
with
as
little
hardness
as
he
was
capable
of
expressing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
cried
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
What
<EOS>
if
you
did
?
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
deaf
this
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
grow
blinder
,
too
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
shaking
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
good
sign
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
ha
!
 
<EOS>
The
best
sign
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
You
saw
too
well
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
patted
Anthony
upon
the
hand
as
one
might
comfort
a
child
,
and
drawing
the
old
man
's
arm
still
further
through
his
own
,
shook
his
trembling
fingers
towards
the
spot
where
Jonas
sat
,
as
though
he
would
wave
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Anthony
remaining
quite
still
and
silent
,
he
relaxed
his
hold
by
slow
degrees
and
lapsed
into
his
usual
niche
in
the
corner
;
merely
putting
forth
his
hand
at
intervals
and
touching
his
old
employer
gently
on
the
coat
,
as
with
the
design
of
assuring
himself
that
he
was
yet
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
was
so
very
much
amazed
by
these
proceedings
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
stare
at
the
two
old
men
,
until
Chuffey
had
fallen
into
his
usual
state
,
and
Anthony
had
sunk
into
a
doze
;
when
he
gave
some
vent
to
his
emotions
by
going
close
up
to
the
former
personage
,
and
making
as
though
he
would
,
in
vulgar
parlance
,
"
punch
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
've
been
carrying
on
this
game
,
"
thought
Jonas
in
a
brown
study
,
"
for
the
last
two
or
three
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
my
father
take
so
much
notice
of
him
as
he
has
in
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
legacy
hunting
,
are
you
,
Mister
Chuff
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
Chuffey
was
as
little
conscious
of
the
thought
as
of
the
bodily
advance
of
Mr
Jonas
's
clenched
fist
,
which
hovered
fondly
about
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
scowled
at
him
to
his
heart
's
content
,
Jonas
took
the
candle
from
the
table
,
and
walking
into
the
glass
office
,
produced
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
With
one
of
these
he
opened
a
secret
drawer
in
the
desk
;
peeping
stealthily
out
,
as
he
did
so
,
to
be
certain
that
the
two
old
men
were
still
before
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
as
right
as
ever
,
"
said
Jonas
,
propping
the
lid
of
the
desk
open
with
his
forehead
,
and
unfolding
a
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
will
,
Mister
Chuff
.
 
<EOS>
Thirty
pound
a
year
for
your
maintenance
,
old
boy
,
and
all
the
rest
to
his
only
son
,
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
trouble
yourself
to
be
too
affectionate
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
get
anything
by
it
.
<EOS>
What
's
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
WAS
startling
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
A
face
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
partition
looking
curiously
in
;
and
not
at
him
but
at
the
paper
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
eyes
were
attentively
cast
down
upon
the
writing
,
and
were
swiftly
raised
when
he
cried
out
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
met
his
own
,
and
were
as
the
eyes
of
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
Suffering
the
lid
of
the
desk
to
fall
with
a
loud
noise
,
but
not
forgetting
even
then
to
lock
it
,
Jonas
,
pale
and
breathless
,
gazed
upon
this
phantom
.
 
<EOS>
It
moved
,
opened
the
door
,
and
walked
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
falling
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Where
do
you
come
from
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Matter
!
"
cried
the
voice
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
Pecksniff
in
the
flesh
smiled
amiably
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
matter
,
Mr
Jonas
!
"
   
"
What
are
you
prying
and
peering
about
here
for
?
"
said
Jonas
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
coming
up
to
town
in
this
way
,
and
taking
one
unawares
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
precious
odd
a
man
ca
n't
read
the
---
the
newspaper
---
in
his
own
office
without
being
startled
out
of
his
wits
by
people
coming
in
without
notice
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
knock
at
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
did
,
Mr
Jonas
,
"
answered
Pecksniff
,
"
but
no
one
heard
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
curious
,
"
he
added
in
his
gentle
way
as
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
young
man
's
shoulder
,
"
to
find
out
what
part
of
the
newspaper
interested
you
so
much
;
but
the
glass
was
too
dim
and
dirty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
glanced
in
haste
at
the
partition
.
 
<EOS>
Well
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
n't
very
clean
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
he
spoke
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
it
poetry
now
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shaking
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
with
an
air
of
cheerful
banter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
was
it
politics
?
<EOS>
Or
was
it
the
price
of
stock
?
 
<EOS>
The
main
chance
,
Mr
Jonas
,
the
main
chance
,
I
suspect
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
ai
n't
far
from
the
truth
,
"
answered
Jonas
,
recovering
himself
and
snuffing
the
candle
;
"
but
how
the
deuce
do
you
come
to
be
in
London
again
?
 
<EOS>
Ecod
!
<EOS>
it
's
enough
to
make
a
man
stare
,
to
see
a
fellow
looking
at
him
all
of
a
sudden
,
who
he
thought
was
sixty
or
seventy
mile
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
my
dear
Mr
Jonas
.
<EOS>
For
while
the
human
mind
is
constituted
as
it
is
---
"
   
"
Oh
,
bother
the
human
mind
,
"
interrupted
Jonas
with
impatience
"
what
have
you
come
up
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
matter
of
business
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
which
has
arisen
quite
unexpectedly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
Jonas
,
"
is
that
all
?
 
<EOS>
Well
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
father
in
the
next
room
.
 
<EOS>
Hallo
father
,
here
's
Pecksniff
!
 
<EOS>
He
gets
more
addle
-
pated
every
day
he
lives
,
I
do
believe
,
"
muttered
Jonas
,
shaking
his
honoured
parent
roundly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
tell
you
Pecksniff
's
here
,
stupid
-
head
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
combined
effects
of
the
shaking
and
this
loving
remonstrance
soon
awoke
the
old
man
,
who
gave
Mr
Pecksniff
a
chuckling
welcome
which
was
attributable
in
part
to
his
being
glad
to
see
that
gentleman
,
and
in
part
to
his
unfading
delight
in
the
recollection
of
having
called
him
a
hypocrite
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pecksniff
had
not
yet
taken
tea
(
indeed
he
had
,
but
an
hour
before
,
arrived
in
London
)
<EOS>
the
remains
of
the
late
collation
,
with
a
rasher
of
bacon
,
were
served
up
for
his
entertainment
;
and
as
Mr
Jonas
had
a
business
appointment
in
the
next
street
,
he
stepped
out
to
keep
it
;
promising
to
return
before
Mr
Pecksniff
could
finish
his
repast
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
my
good
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
to
Anthony
;
"
now
that
we
are
alone
,
pray
tell
me
what
I
can
do
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
alone
,
because
I
believe
that
our
dear
friend
Mr
Chuffey
is
,
metaphysically
speaking
,
a
---
shall
I
say
a
dummy
?
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
with
his
sweetest
smile
,
and
his
head
very
much
on
one
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
neither
hears
us
,
"
replied
Anthony
,
"
nor
sees
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
I
will
be
bold
to
say
,
with
the
utmost
sympathy
for
his
afflictions
,
and
the
greatest
admiration
of
those
excellent
qualities
which
do
equal
honour
to
his
head
and
to
his
heart
,
that
he
is
what
is
playfully
termed
a
dummy
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
going
to
observe
,
my
dear
sir
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
going
to
make
any
observation
that
I
know
of
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
mildly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
YOU
were
?
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
never
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
previously
rising
to
see
that
the
door
was
shut
,
and
arranging
his
chair
when
he
came
back
,
so
that
it
could
not
be
opened
in
the
least
without
his
immediately
becoming
aware
of
the
circumstance
;
"
that
I
never
in
my
life
was
so
astonished
as
by
the
receipt
of
your
letter
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
should
do
me
the
honour
to
wish
to
take
counsel
with
me
on
any
matter
,
amazed
me
;
but
that
you
should
desire
to
do
so
,
to
the
exclusion
even
of
Mr
Jonas
,
showed
an
amount
of
confidence
in
one
to
whom
you
had
done
a
verbal
injury
---
merely
a
verbal
injury
,
you
were
anxious
to
repair
---
which
gratified
,
which
moved
,
which
overcame
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
always
a
glib
speaker
,
but
he
delivered
this
short
address
very
glibly
;
having
been
at
some
pains
to
compose
it
outside
the
coach
.
   
<EOS>
Although
he
paused
for
a
reply
,
and
truly
said
that
he
was
there
at
Anthony
's
request
,
the
old
man
sat
gazing
at
him
in
profound
silence
and
with
a
perfectly
blank
face
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
seem
to
have
the
least
desire
or
impulse
to
pursue
the
conversation
,
though
Mr
Pecksniff
looked
towards
the
door
,
and
pulled
out
his
watch
,
and
gave
him
many
other
hints
that
their
time
was
short
,
and
Jonas
,
if
he
kept
his
word
,
would
soon
return
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
strangest
incident
in
all
this
strange
behaviour
was
,
that
of
a
sudden
,
in
a
moment
,
so
swiftly
that
it
was
impossible
to
trace
how
,
or
to
observe
any
process
of
change
,
his
features
fell
into
their
old
expression
,
and
he
cried
,
striking
his
hand
passionately
upon
the
table
as
if
no
interval
at
all
had
taken
place
:
   
"
<EOS>
Will
you
hold
your
tongue
,
sir
,
and
let
me
speak
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
deferred
to
him
with
a
submissive
bow
;
and
said
within
himself
,
"
I
knew
his
hand
was
changed
,
and
that
his
writing
staggered
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
so
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Ahem
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jonas
is
sweet
upon
your
daughter
,
Pecksniff
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
in
his
usual
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
spoke
of
that
,
if
you
remember
,
sir
,
at
Mrs
Todgers
's
,
"
replied
the
courteous
architect
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
speak
so
loud
,
"
retorted
Anthony
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
so
deaf
as
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
certainly
raised
his
voice
pretty
high
;
not
so
much
because
he
thought
Anthony
was
deaf
,
as
because
he
felt
convinced
that
his
perceptive
faculties
were
waxing
dim
;
but
this
quick
resentment
of
his
considerate
behaviour
greatly
disconcerted
him
,
and
,
not
knowing
what
tack
to
shape
his
course
upon
,
he
made
another
inclination
of
the
head
,
yet
more
submissive
that
the
last
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
,
"
repeated
the
old
man
,
"
that
Jonas
is
sweet
upon
your
daughter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
charming
girl
,
sir
,
"
murmured
Mr
Pecksniff
,
seeing
that
he
waited
for
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
dear
girl
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
though
I
say
it
,
who
should
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
better
,
"
cried
the
old
man
,
advancing
his
weazen
face
at
least
a
yard
,
and
starting
forward
in
his
chair
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
lie
!
 
<EOS>
What
,
you
WILL
be
a
hypocrite
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
sir
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
call
me
a
good
sir
,
"
retorted
Anthony
,
"
and
do
n't
claim
to
be
one
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
If
your
daughter
was
what
you
would
have
me
believe
,
she
would
n't
do
for
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
Being
what
she
is
,
I
think
she
will
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
be
deceived
in
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
run
riot
,
contract
debts
,
and
waste
his
substance
.
 
<EOS>
Now
when
I
am
dead
---
"
   
His
face
altered
so
horribly
as
he
said
the
word
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
really
was
fain
to
look
another
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
It
will
be
worse
for
me
to
know
of
such
doings
,
than
if
I
was
alive
;
for
to
be
tormented
for
getting
that
together
,
which
even
while
I
suffer
for
its
acquisition
,
is
flung
into
the
very
kennels
of
the
streets
,
would
be
insupportable
torture
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
hoarsely
,
"
let
that
be
saved
at
least
;
let
there
be
something
gained
,
and
kept
fast
hold
of
,
when
so
much
is
lost
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
"
these
are
unwholesome
fancies
;
quite
unnecessary
,
sir
,
quite
uncalled
for
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
you
are
not
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
dying
though
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Anthony
,
with
something
like
the
snarl
of
a
wild
animal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
!
 
<EOS>
There
are
years
of
life
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
look
at
him
,
"
pointing
to
his
feeble
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Death
has
no
right
to
leave
him
standing
,
and
to
mow
me
down
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
so
much
afraid
of
the
old
man
,
and
so
completely
taken
aback
by
the
state
in
which
he
found
him
,
that
he
had
not
even
presence
of
mind
enough
to
call
up
a
scrap
of
morality
from
the
great
storehouse
within
his
own
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
he
stammered
out
that
no
doubt
it
was
,
in
fairness
and
decency
,
Mr
Chuffey
's
turn
to
expire
;
and
that
from
all
he
had
heard
of
Mr
Chuffey
,
and
the
little
he
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
of
that
gentleman
,
personally
,
he
felt
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
see
the
propriety
of
expiring
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
here
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
old
man
,
beckoning
him
to
draw
nearer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jonas
will
be
my
heir
,
Jonas
will
be
rich
,
and
a
great
catch
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
is
sweet
upon
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
too
,
"
thought
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
for
you
have
said
it
often
enough
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
might
get
more
money
than
with
her
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
but
she
will
help
him
to
take
care
of
what
they
have
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
not
too
young
or
heedless
,
and
comes
of
a
good
hard
griping
stock
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
play
too
fine
a
game
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
holds
him
by
a
thread
;
and
if
you
draw
it
too
tight
<EOS>
(
I
know
his
temper
)
<EOS>
it
'll
snap
.
 
<EOS>
Bind
him
when
he
's
in
the
mood
,
Pecksniff
;
bind
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
too
deep
.
 
<EOS>
In
your
way
of
leading
him
on
,
you
'll
leave
him
miles
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Bah
,
you
man
of
oil
,
have
I
no
eyes
to
see
how
you
have
angled
with
him
from
the
first
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
wonder
,
"
thought
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
at
him
with
a
wistful
face
,
"
whether
this
is
all
he
has
to
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Anthony
rubbed
his
hands
and
muttered
to
himself
;
complained
again
that
he
was
cold
;
drew
his
chair
before
the
fire
;
and
,
sitting
with
his
back
to
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
his
chin
sunk
down
upon
his
breast
,
was
,
in
another
minute
,
quite
regardless
or
forgetful
of
his
presence
.
   
<EOS>
Uncouth
and
unsatisfactory
as
this
short
interview
had
been
<EOS>
,
it
had
furnished
Mr
Pecksniff
with
a
hint
which
,
supposing
nothing
further
were
imparted
to
him
,
repaid
the
journey
up
and
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
good
gentleman
had
never
(
for
want
of
an
opportunity
)
dived
into
the
depths
of
Mr
Jonas
's
nature
;
and
any
recipe
for
catching
such
a
son
-
in
-
law
(
much
more
one
written
on
a
leaf
out
of
his
own
father
's
book
)
was
worth
the
having
.
 
<EOS>
In
order
that
he
might
lose
no
chance
of
improving
so
fair
an
opportunity
by
allowing
Anthony
to
fall
asleep
before
he
had
finished
all
he
had
to
say
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
the
disposal
of
the
refreshments
on
the
table
,
a
work
to
which
he
now
applied
himself
in
earnest
,
resorted
to
many
ingenious
contrivances
for
attracting
his
attention
;
such
as
coughing
,
sneezing
,
clattering
the
teacups
,
sharpening
the
knives
,
dropping
the
loaf
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
in
vain
,
for
Mr
Jonas
returned
,
and
Anthony
had
said
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
My
father
asleep
again
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
as
he
hung
up
his
hat
,
and
cast
a
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
and
snoring
.
 
<EOS>
Only
hear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
snores
very
deep
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Snores
deep
?
"
repeated
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
let
him
alone
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
snore
for
six
,
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Mr
Jonas
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
"
that
I
think
your
father
is
---
do
n't
let
me
alarm
you
---
breaking
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
is
he
though
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Jonas
,
with
a
shake
of
the
head
which
expressed
the
closeness
of
his
dutiful
observation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ecod
,
you
do
n't
know
how
tough
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
upon
the
move
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
struck
me
that
he
was
changed
,
both
in
his
appearance
and
manner
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
you
know
about
it
,
"
returned
Jonas
,
seating
himself
with
a
melancholy
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
never
was
better
than
he
is
now
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
they
all
at
home
?
 
<EOS>
How
's
Charity
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Blooming
,
Mr
Jonas
,
blooming
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
the
other
one
;
how
's
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Volatile
trifler
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
fondly
musing
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
well
,
she
is
well
.
 
<EOS>
Roving
from
parlour
to
bedroom
,
Mr
Jonas
,
like
a
bee
,
skimming
from
post
to
pillar
,
like
the
butterfly
;
<EOS>
dipping
her
young
beak
into
our
currant
wine
,
like
the
humming
-
bird
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
were
she
a
little
less
giddy
than
she
is
;
and
had
she
but
the
sterling
qualities
of
Cherry
,
my
young
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
she
so
very
giddy
,
then
?
"
asked
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
great
feeling
;
"
let
me
not
be
hard
upon
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
her
sister
Cherry
<EOS>
she
appears
so
.
 
<EOS>
A
strange
noise
that
,
Mr
Jonas
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Something
wrong
in
the
clock
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Jonas
,
glancing
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
the
other
one
ai
n't
your
favourite
,
ai
n't
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
fond
father
was
about
to
reply
,
and
had
already
summoned
into
his
face
a
look
of
most
intense
sensibility
,
when
the
sound
he
had
already
noticed
was
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Mr
Jonas
,
that
is
a
very
extraordinary
clock
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
,
if
it
had
made
the
noise
which
startled
them
;
but
another
kind
of
time
-
piece
was
fast
running
down
,
and
from
that
the
sound
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
A
scream
from
Chuffey
,
rendered
a
hundred
times
more
loud
and
formidable
by
his
silent
habits
,
made
the
house
ring
from
roof
to
cellar
;
and
,
looking
round
,
they
saw
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
extended
on
the
floor
,
with
the
old
clerk
upon
his
knees
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
fallen
from
his
chair
in
a
fit
,
and
lay
there
,
battling
for
each
gasp
of
breath
,
with
every
shrivelled
vein
and
sinew
starting
in
its
place
,
as
if
it
were
bent
on
bearing
witness
to
his
age
,
and
sternly
pleading
with
Nature
against
his
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
frightful
to
see
how
the
principle
of
life
,
shut
up
within
his
withered
frame
,
fought
like
a
strong
devil
,
mad
to
be
released
,
and
rent
its
ancient
prison
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
man
in
the
fullness
of
his
vigour
,
struggling
with
so
much
strength
of
desperation
,
would
have
been
a
dismal
sight
;
but
an
old
,
old
,
shrunken
body
,
endowed
with
preternatural
might
,
and
giving
the
lie
in
every
motion
of
its
every
limb
and
joint
to
its
enfeebled
aspect
,
was
a
hideous
spectacle
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
They
raised
him
up
,
and
fetched
a
surgeon
with
all
haste
,
who
bled
the
patient
and
applied
some
remedies
;
but
the
fits
held
him
so
long
that
it
was
past
midnight
when
they
got
him
---
quiet
now
,
but
quite
unconscious
and
exhausted
---
into
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
,
"
said
Jonas
,
putting
his
ashy
lips
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
ear
and
whispered
across
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
mercy
you
were
present
when
he
was
taken
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Some
one
might
have
said
it
was
my
doing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
YOUR
doing
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
but
they
might
,
"
he
replied
,
wiping
the
moisture
from
his
white
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
People
say
such
things
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
he
look
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
joke
,
you
know
,
"
said
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
---
<EOS>
I
never
wished
him
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
he
's
very
bad
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
doctor
said
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
You
heard
,
"
was
Mr
Pecksniff
's
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
he
might
say
that
to
charge
us
more
,
in
case
of
his
getting
well
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
go
away
,
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
's
come
to
this
,
I
would
n't
be
without
a
witness
for
a
thousand
pound
.
"
   
<EOS>
Chuffey
said
not
a
word
,
and
heard
not
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
sat
himself
down
in
a
chair
at
the
bedside
,
and
there
he
remained
,
motionless
;
except
that
he
sometimes
bent
his
head
over
the
pillow
,
and
seemed
to
listen
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
changed
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
Though
once
in
the
dreary
night
Mr
Pecksniff
,
having
dozed
,
awoke
with
a
confused
impression
that
he
had
heard
him
praying
,
and
strangely
mingling
figures
---
not
of
speech
,
but
arithmetic
---
with
his
broken
prayers
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
sat
there
,
too
,
all
night
;
not
where
his
father
could
have
seen
him
,
had
his
consciousness
returned
,
but
<EOS>
hiding
,
as
it
were
,
behind
him
,
and
only
reading
how
he
looked
,
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
HE
,
the
coarse
upstart
,
who
had
ruled
the
house
so
long
---
that
craven
cur
,
who
was
afraid
to
move
,
and
shook
so
,
that
his
very
shadow
fluttered
on
the
wall
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
broad
,
bright
,
stirring
day
when
,
leaving
the
old
clerk
to
watch
him
,
they
went
down
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
People
hurried
up
and
down
the
street
;
windows
and
doors
were
opened
;
thieves
and
beggars
took
their
usual
posts
;
workmen
bestirred
themselves
;
tradesmen
set
forth
their
shops
;
bailiffs
and
constables
were
on
the
watch
;
all
kinds
of
human
creatures
strove
,
in
their
several
ways
,
as
hard
to
live
,
as
the
one
sick
old
man
who
combated
for
every
grain
of
sand
in
his
fast
-
emptying
glass
,
as
eagerly
as
if
it
were
an
empire
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
anything
happens
Pecksniff
,
"
said
Jonas
,
"
you
must
promise
me
to
stop
here
till
it
's
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
see
that
I
do
what
's
right

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
you
will
do
what
's
right
,
Mr
Jonas
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
be
doubted
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
shall
have
it
in
his
power
to
say
a
syllable
against
me
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
people
will
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
if
he
was
n't
old
,
or
I
had
the
secret
of
keeping
him
alive
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
promised
that
he
would
remain
,
if
circumstances
should
render
it
,
in
his
esteemed
friend
's
opinion
,
desirable
;
they
were
finishing
their
meal
in
silence
,
when
suddenly
an
apparition
stood
before
them
,
so
ghastly
to
the
view
that
Jonas
shrieked
aloud
,
and
both
recoiled
in
horror
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Anthony
,
dressed
in
his
usual
clothes
,
was
in
the
room
---
beside
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
leaned
upon
the
shoulder
of
his
solitary
friend
;
and
on
his
livid
face
,
and
on
his
horny
hands
,
and
in
his
glassy
eyes
,
and
traced
by
an
eternal
finger
in
the
very
drops
of
sweat
upon
his
brow
,
was
one
word
---
Death
.
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
them
---
in
something
of
his
own
voice
too
,
but
sharpened
and
made
hollow
,
like
a
dead
man
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
What
he
would
have
said
,
God
knows
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
utter
words
,
but
they
were
such
as
man
had
never
heard
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
most
fearful
circumstance
of
all
,
to
see
him
standing
there
,
gabbling
in
an
unearthly
tongue
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
better
now
,
"
said
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
now
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
sit
in
his
old
chair
,
and
he
'll
be
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
not
to
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
so
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
put
him
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
and
wheeled
it
near
the
window
;
then
<EOS>
,
swinging
open
the
door
,
exposed
him
to
the
free
current
of
morning
air
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
all
the
air
that
is
,
nor
all
the
winds
that
ever
blew
'
twixt
Heaven
and
Earth
,
could
have
brought
new
life
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
Plunge
him
to
the
throat
in
golden
pieces
now
,
and
his
heavy
fingers
shall
not
close
on
one
!

The
reader
is
brought
into
communication
with
some
professional
persons
,
and
sheds
a
tear
over
the
filail
piety
of
good
Mr
Jonas
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
in
a
hackney
cabriolet
,
for
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
had
said
"
Spare
no
expense
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mankind
is
evil
in
its
thoughts
and
in
its
base
constructions
,
and
Jonas
was
resolved
it
should
not
have
an
inch
to
stretch
into
an
ell
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
should
be
charged
upon
his
father
's
son
that
he
had
grudged
the
money
for
his
father
's
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
until
the
obsequies
should
be
concluded
,
Jonas
had
taken
for
his
motto
"
Spend
,
and
spare
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
been
to
the
undertaker
,
and
was
now
upon
his
way
to
another
officer
in
the
train
of
mourning
---
a
female
functionary
,
a
nurse
,
and
watcher
,
and
performer
of
nameless
offices
about
the
persons
of
the
dead
---
whom
he
had
recommended
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
,
as
Mr
Pecksniff
gathered
from
a
scrap
of
writing
in
his
hand
,
was
Gamp
;
her
residence
in
Kingsgate
Street
,
High
Holborn
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
a
hackney
cab
,
was
rattling
over
Holborn
stones
,
in
quest
of
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
This
lady
lodged
at
a
bird
-
fancier
's
,
next
door
but
one
to
the
celebrated
mutton
-
pie
shop
,
and
directly
opposite
to
the
original
cat's
-
meat
warehouse
;
the
renown
of
which
establishments
was
duly
heralded
on
their
respective
fronts
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
house
,
and
this
was
the
more
convenient
;
for
Mrs
Gamp
being
,
in
her
highest
walk
of
art
,
a
monthly
nurse
,
or
,
as
her
sign
-
board
boldly
had
it
,
"
Midwife
,
"
and
lodging
in
the
first
-
floor
front
,
was
easily
assailable
at
night
by
pebbles
,
walking
-
sticks
,
and
fragments
of
tobacco
-
pipe
;
all
much
more
efficacious
than
the
street
-
door
knocker
,
which
was
so
constructed
as
to
wake
the
street
with
ease
,
and
even
spread
alarms
of
fire
in
Holborn
,
without
making
the
smallest
impression
on
the
premises
to
which
it
was
addressed
.
   
<EOS>
It
chanced
on
this
particular
occasion
,
that
Mrs
Gamp
had
been
up
all
the
previous
night
,
in
attendance
upon
a
ceremony
to
which
the
usage
of
gossips
has
given
that
name
which
expresses
,
in
two
syllables
,
the
curse
pronounced
on
Adam
.
 
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
Mrs
Gamp
had
not
been
regularly
engaged
,
but
had
been
called
in
at
a
crisis
,
in
consequence
of
her
great
repute
,
to
assist
another
professional
lady
with
her
advice
;
and
thus
it
happened
that
,
all
points
of
interest
in
the
case
being
over
,
Mrs
Gamp
had
come
home
again
to
the
bird
-
fancier
's
and
gone
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
So
when
Mr
Pecksniff
drove
up
in
the
hackney
cab
,
Mrs
Gamp
's
curtains
were
drawn
close
,
and
Mrs
Gamp
was
fast
asleep
behind
them
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
bird
-
fancier
had
been
at
home
,
as
he
ought
to
have
been
,
there
would
have
been
no
great
harm
in
this
;
but
he
was
out
,
and
his
shop
was
closed
.
 
<EOS>
The
shutters
were
down
certainly
;
and
in
every
pane
of
glass
there
was
at
least
one
tiny
bird
in
a
tiny
bird
-
cage
,
twittering
and
hopping
his
little
ballet
of
despair
,
and
knocking
his
head
against
the
roof
;
while
one
unhappy
goldfinch
who
lived
outside
a
red
villa
with
his
name
on
the
door
,
drew
the
water
for
his
own
drinking
,
and
mutely
appealed
to
some
good
man
to
drop
a
farthing's
-
worth
of
poison
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
the
door
was
shut
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
tried
the
latch
,
and
shook
it
,
causing
a
cracked
bell
inside
to
ring
most
mournfully
;
but
no
one
came
.
 
<EOS>
The
bird
-
fancier
was
an
easy
shaver
also
,
and
a
fashionable
hair
-
dresser
also
,
and
perhaps
he
had
been
sent
for
,
express
,
from
the
court
end
of
the
town
,
to
trim
a
lord
,
or
cut
and
curl
a
lady
;
but
however
that
might
be
,
there
,
upon
his
own
ground
,
he
was
not
;
nor
was
there
any
more
distinct
trace
of
him
to
assist
the
imagination
of
an
inquirer
,
than
a
professional
print
or
emblem
of
his
calling
(
much
favoured
in
the
trade
)
,
representing
a
hair
-
dresser
of
easy
manners
curling
a
lady
of
distinguished
fashion
,
in
the
presence
of
a
patent
upright
grand
pianoforte
.
   
<EOS>
Noting
these
circumstances
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
,
applied
himself
to
the
knocker
;
but
at
the
first
double
knock
every
window
in
the
street
became
alive
with
female
heads
;
and
before
he
could
repeat
the
performance
whole
troops
of
married
ladies
(
some
about
to
trouble
Mrs
Gamp
themselves
very
shortly
)
<EOS>
came
flocking
round
the
steps
,
all
crying
out
with
one
accord
,
and
with
uncommon
interest
,
"
Knock
at
the
winder
,
sir
,
knock
at
the
winder
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
do
n't
lose
no
more
time
than
you
can
help
---
knock
at
the
winder
!
"
   
<EOS>
Acting
upon
this
suggestion
,
and
borrowing
the
driver
's
whip
for
the
purpose
,
Mr
Pecksniff
soon
made
a
commotion
among
the
first
floor
flower
-
pots
,
and
roused
Mrs
Gamp
,
whose
voice
---
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
matrons
---
was
heard
to
say
,
"
I
'm
coming
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
pale
as
a
muffin
,
"
said
one
lady
,
in
allusion
to
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
he
ought
to
be
,
if
he
's
the
feelings
of
a
man
,
"
observed
another
.
   
<EOS>
A
third
lady
(
with
her
arms
folded
)
said
she
wished
he
had
chosen
any
other
time
for
fetching
Mrs
Gamp
,
but
it
always
happened
so
with
HER
.
   
<EOS>
It
gave
Mr
Pecksniff
much
uneasiness
to
find
,
from
these
remarks
,
that
he
was
supposed
to
have
come
to
Mrs
Gamp
upon
an
errand
touching
---
not
the
close
of
life
,
but
the
other
end
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
herself
was
under
the
same
impression
,
for
,
throwing
open
the
window
<EOS>
,
she
cried
behind
the
curtains
,
as
she
hastily
attired
herself
---
    
"
Is
it
Mrs
Perkins
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
returned
Mr
Pecksniff
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
of
the
sort
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
Mr
Whilks
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
it
's
you
,
Mr
Whilks
,
and
that
poor
creetur
Mrs
Whilks
with
not
even
a
pincushion
ready
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
it
's
you
,
Mr
Whilks
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
Mr
Whilks
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
the
man
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
the
kind
.
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
is
dead
;
and
some
person
being
wanted
in
the
house
<EOS>
,
you
have
been
recommended
by
Mr
Mould
the
undertaker
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
was
by
this
time
in
a
condition
to
appear
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
who
had
a
face
for
all
occasions
,
looked
out
of
the
window
with
her
mourning
countenance
,
and
said
she
would
be
down
directly
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
matrons
took
it
very
ill
that
Mr
Pecksniff
's
mission
was
of
so
unimportant
a
kind
;
and
the
lady
with
her
arms
folded
rated
him
in
good
round
terms
,
signifying
that
she
would
be
glad
to
know
what
he
meant
by
terrifying
delicate
females
"
with
his
corpses
;
"
and
giving
it
as
her
opinion
that
he
was
quite
ugly
enough
to
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
ladies
were
not
at
all
behind
-
hand
in
expressing
similar
sentiments
;
and
the
children
,
of
whom
some
scores
had
now
collected
,
hooted
and
defied
Mr
Pecksniff
quite
savagely
.
 
<EOS>
So
when
Mrs
Gamp
appeared
,
the
unoffending
gentleman
was
glad
to
hustle
her
with
very
little
ceremony
into
the
cabriolet
,
and
drive
off
,
overwhelmed
with
popular
execration
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
had
a
large
bundle
with
her
,
a
pair
of
pattens
,
and
a
species
of
gig
umbrella
;
the
latter
article
in
colour
like
a
faded
leaf
,
except
where
a
circular
patch
of
a
lively
blue
had
been
dexterously
let
in
at
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
much
flurried
by
the
haste
she
had
made
,
and
laboured
under
the
most
erroneous
views
of
cabriolets
,
which
she
appeared
to
confound
with
mail
-
coaches
or
stage
-
wagons
,
inasmuch
as
she
was
constantly
endeavouring
for
the
first
half
mile
to
force
her
luggage
through
the
little
front
window
,
and
clamouring
to
the
driver
to
"
put
it
in
the
boot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
she
was
disabused
of
this
idea
,
her
whole
being
resolved
itself
into
an
absorbing
anxiety
about
her
pattens
,
with
which
she
played
innumerable
games
at
quoits
on
Mr
Pecksniff
's
legs
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
they
were
close
upon
the
house
of
mourning
that
she
had
enough
composure
to
observe
---
    
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
the
gentleman
's
dead
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
The
more
's
the
pity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
did
n't
even
know
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
what
we
must
all
come
to
.
<EOS>
It
's
as
certain
as
being
born
,
except
that
we
ca
n't
make
our
calculations
as
exact
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
a
fat
old
woman
,
this
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
a
husky
voice
and
a
moist
eye
,
which
she
had
a
remarkable
power
of
turning
up
,
and
only
showing
the
white
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Having
very
little
neck
,
it
cost
her
some
trouble
to
look
over
herself
,
if
one
may
say
so
,
at
those
to
whom
she
talked
.
 
<EOS>
She
wore
a
very
rusty
black
gown
,
rather
the
worse
for
snuff
,
and
a
shawl
and
bonnet
to
correspond
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
dilapidated
articles
of
dress
she
had
,
on
principle
,
arrayed
herself
,
time
out
of
mind
,
on
such
occasions
as
the
present
;
for
this
at
once
expressed
a
decent
amount
of
veneration
for
the
deceased
,
and
invited
the
next
of
kin
to
present
her
with
a
fresher
suit
of
weeds
;
an
appeal
so
frequently
successful
,
that
the
very
fetch
and
ghost
of
Mrs
Gamp
,
bonnet
and
all
,
might
be
seen
hanging
up
,
any
hour
in
the
day
,
in
at
least
a
dozen
of
the
second
-
hand
clothes
shops
about
Holborn
.
 
<EOS>
The
face
of
Mrs
Gamp
---
the
nose
in
particular
---
was
somewhat
red
and
swollen
,
and
it
was
difficult
to
enjoy
her
society
without
becoming
conscious
of
a
smell
of
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
Like
most
persons
who
have
attained
to
great
eminence
in
their
profession
,
she
took
to
hers
very
kindly
;
insomuch
that
,
setting
aside
her
natural
predilections
as
a
woman
,
she
went
to
a
lying
-
in
or
a
laying
-
out
with
equal
zest
and
relish
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
repeated
Mrs
Gamp
;
for
it
was
always
a
safe
sentiment
in
cases
of
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
dear
!
 
<EOS>
When
Gamp
was
summoned
to
his
long
home
,
and
I
see
him
a
-
lying
in
Guy
's
Hospital
with
a
penny
-
piece
on
each
eye
,
and
his
wooden
leg
under
his
left
arm
<EOS>
,
I
thought
I
should
have
fainted
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
bore
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
certain
whispers
current
in
the
Kingsgate
Street
circles
had
any
truth
in
them
,
she
had
indeed
borne
up
surprisingly
;
and
had
exerted
such
uncommon
fortitude
as
to
dispose
of
Mr
Gamp
's
remains
for
the
benefit
of
science
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
should
be
added
,
in
fairness
,
that
this
had
happened
twenty
years
before
;
and
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Gamp
had
long
been
separated
on
the
ground
of
incompatibility
of
temper
in
their
drink
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
become
indifferent
since
then
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Use
is
second
nature
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
say
second
nater
,
sir
,
"
returned
that
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
's
first
ways
is
to
find
sich
things
a
trial
to
the
feelings
,
and
so
is
one
's
lasting
custom
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
was
n't
for
the
nerve
a
little
sip
of
liquor
gives
me
(
I
never
was
able
to
do
more

taste
it
)
,
I
never
could
go
through
with
what
I
sometimes
has
to
do

Mrs

at

The
conclusion
of
this
affecting
narrative
brought
them
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
passage
they
encountered
Mr
Mould
the
undertaker
;
a
little
elderly
gentleman
,
bald
,
and
in
a
suit
of
black
;
with
a
notebook
in
his
hand
,
a
massive
gold
watch
-
chain
dangling
from
his
fob
,
and
a
face
in
which
a
queer
attempt
at
melancholy
was
at
odds
with
a
smirk
of
satisfaction
;
so
that
he
looked
as
a
man
<EOS>
might
,
who
,
in
the
very
act
of
smacking
his
lips
over
choice
old
wine
,
tried
to
make
believe
it
was
physic
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
and
how
are
YOU
,
Mrs
Gamp
?
<EOS>
"
said
this
gentleman
,
in
a
voice
as
soft
as
his
step
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pretty
well
,
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
dropping
a
curtsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
very
particular
here
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
a
common
case
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
Let
everything
be
very
nice
and
comfortable
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
the
undertaker
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
solemn
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
she
replied
,
curtseying
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
knows
me
of
old
,
sir
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
too
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
said
the
undertaker
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
think
so
also
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
curtseyed
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
one
of
the
most
impressive
cases
,
sir
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
that
I
have
seen
in
the
whole
course
of
my
professional
experience
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Mr
Mould
!
"
cried
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
affectionate
regret
,
sir
,
I
never
saw
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
limitation
,
there
is
positively
NO
limitation
"
---
opening
his
eyes
wide
,
and
standing
on
tiptoe
---
"
in
point
of
expense
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
orders
,
sir
,
to
put
on
my
whole
establishment
of
mutes
;
and
mutes
come
very
dear
,
Mr
Pecksniff
;
not
to
mention
their
drink
.
 
<EOS>
To
provide
silver
-
plated
handles
of
the
very
best
description
,
ornamented
with
angels
'
heads
from
the
most
expensive
dies
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
perfectly
profuse
in
feathers
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
sir
,
to
turn
out
something
absolutely
gorgeous
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Mr
Jonas
is
an
excellent
man
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
what
is
filial
in
my
time
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mould
,
"
and
what
is
unfilial
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
our
lot
.
 
<EOS>
We
come
into
the
knowledge
of
those
secrets
.
 
<EOS>
But
anything
so
filial
as
this
;
anything
so
honourable
to
human
nature
;
so
calculated
to
reconcile
all
of
us
to
the
world
we
live
in
;
never
yet
came
under
my
observation
.
 
<EOS>
It
only
proves
,
sir
,
what
was
so
forcibly
observed
by
the
lamented
theatrical
poet
---
buried
at
Stratford
---
that
there
is
good
in
everything
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
pleasant
to
hear
you
say
so
,
Mr
Mould
,
"
observed
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
a
man
Mr
Chuzzlewit
was
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
a
man
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
talk
of
your
lord
mayors
,
"
said
Mould
,
waving
his
hand
at
the
public
in
general
,
"
your
sheriffs
,
your
common
councilmen
,
your
trumpery
;
but
show
me
a
man
in
this
city
who
is
worthy
to
walk
in
the
shoes
of
the
departed
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
cried
Mould
,
with
bitter
sarcasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hang
'em
up
<EOS>
,
hang
'em
up
;
sole
'em
and
heel
'em
,
and
have
'em
ready
for
his
son
against
<EOS>
he
's
old
enough
to
wear
'em
;
but
do
n't
try
'em
on
yourselves
,
for
they
wo
n't
fit
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
knew
him
,
"
said
Mould
,
in
the
same
biting
vein
,
as
he
pocketed
his
note
-
book
;
"
we
knew
him
,
and
are
not
to
be
caught
with
chaff
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
sir
,
good
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
returned
the
compliment
;
and
Mould
,
sensible
of
having
distinguished
himself
,
was
going
away
with
a
brisk
smile
,
when
he
fortunately
remembered
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Quickly
becoming
depressed
again
,
he
sighed
;
looked
into
the
crown
of
his
hat
,
as
if
for
comfort
;
put
it
on
without
finding
any
;
and
slowly
departed
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
and
Mr
Pecksniff
then
ascended
the
staircase
;
and
the
former
,
having
been
shown
to
the
chamber
in
which
all
that
remained
of
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
lay
covered
up
,
with
but
one
loving
heart
,
and
that
a
halting
one
,
to
mourn
it
,
left
the
latter
free
to
enter
the
darkened
room
below
,
and
rejoin
Mr
Jonas
,
from
whom
he
had
now
been
absent
nearly
two
hours
.
   
<EOS>
He
found
that
example
to
bereaved
sons
,
and
pattern
in
the
eyes
of
all
performers
of
funerals
,
musing
over
a
fragment
of
writing
-
paper
on
the
desk
,
and
scratching
figures
on
it
with
a
pen
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
's
chair
,
and
hat
,
and
walking
-
stick
,
were
removed
from
their
accustomed
places
,
and
put
out
of
sight
;
the
window
-
blinds
as
yellow
as
November
fogs
,
were
drawn
down
close
;
Jonas
himself
was
so
subdued
,
that
he
could
scarcely
be
heard
to
speak
,
and
only
seen
to
walk
across
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pecksniff
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
you
shall
have
the
regulation
of
it
all
,
mind
!
 
<EOS>
You
shall
be
able
to
tell
anybody
who
talks
about
it
that
everything
was
correctly
and
nicely
done
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
n't
any
one
you
'd
like
to
ask
to
the
funeral
,
is
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr
Jonas
,
I
think
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
if
there
is
,
you
know
,
"
said
Jonas
,
"
ask
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
want
to
make
a
secret
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
,
after
a
little
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
the
less
obliged
to
you
on
that
account
,
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
,
for
your
liberal
hospitality
;
but
there
really
is
no
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Jonas
;
"
<EOS>
then
you
,
and
I
,
and
Chuffey
,
and
the
doctor
,
will
be
just
a
coachful
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
have
the
doctor
,
Pecksniff
,
because
he
knows
what
was
the
matter
with
him
,
and
that
it
could
n't
be
helped
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
our
dear
friend
,
Mr
Chuffey
?
"
asked
Pecksniff
,
looking
round
the
chamber
,
and
winking
both
his
eyes
at
once
---
for
he
was
overcome
by
his
feelings
.
   
<EOS>
But
here
he
was
interrupted
by
Mrs
Gamp
,
who
,
divested
of
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
came
sidling
and
bridling
into
the
room
;
and
with
some
sharpness
demanded
a
conference
outside
the
door
with
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
whatever
you
wish
to
say
here
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
said
that
gentleman
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
melancholy
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
much
as
I
have
to
say
when
people
is
a
-
mourning
for
the
dead
and
gone
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
;
"
but
what
I
have
to
say
is
TO
the
pint
and
purpose
,
and
no
offence
intended
,
must
be
so
considered
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
at
a
many
places
in
my
time
,
gentlemen
,
and
I
hope
I
knows
what
my
duties
is
,
and
how
the
same
should
be
performed
;
in
course
,
if
I
did
not
,
it
would
be
very
strange
,
and
very
wrong
in
sich
<EOS>
a
gentleman
as
Mr
Mould
,
which
has
undertook
the
highest
families
in
this
land
,
and
given
every
satisfaction
,
so
to
recommend
me
as
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
deal
of
trouble
my
own
self
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
laying
greater
and
greater
stress
upon
her
words
,
"
and
I
can
feel
for
them
as
has
their
feelings
tried
,
but
I
am
not
a
Rooshan
or
a
Prooshan
,
and
consequently
can
not
suffer
Spies
to
be
set
over
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Before
it
was
possible
that
an
answer
could
be
returned
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
growing
redder
in
the
face
,
went
on
to
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
easy
matter
,
gentlemen
,
to
live
when
you
are
left
a
widder
woman
;
particular
when
your
feelings
works
upon
you
to
that
extent
that
you
often
find
yourself
a
-
going
out
on
terms
which
is
a
certain
loss
,
and
never
can
repay
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
whatever
way
you
earns
your
bread
,
you
may
have
rules
and
regulations
of
your
own
which
can
not
be
broke
through
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
again
entrenching
herself
behind
her
strong
point
,
as
if
it
were
not
assailable
by
human
ingenuity
,
"
may
be
Rooshans
,
and
others
may
be
Prooshans
;
they
are
born
so
,
and
will
please
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Them
which
is
of
other
naturs
thinks
different
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
understand
this
good
lady
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
turning
to
Jonas
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Chuffey
is
troublesome
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
fetch
him
down
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
tell
you
he
was
up
there
,
when
she
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
go
myself
and
bring
him
down
,
only
---
<EOS>
only
I
'd
<EOS>
rather
you
went
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
promptly
departed
,
followed
by
Mrs
Gamp
,
who
,
seeing
that
he
took
a
bottle
and
glass
from
the
cupboard
,
and
carried
it
in
his
hand
,
was
much
softened
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
if
it
was
n't
for
his
own
happiness
,
I
should
no
more
mind
him
being
there
,
poor
dear
,
than
if
he
was
a
fly
.
 
<EOS>
But
them
as
is
n't
used
to
these
things
,
thinks
so
much
of
'em
afterwards
,
that
it
's
a
kindness
to
'em
not
to
let
'em
have
their
wish
.
 
<EOS>
And
even
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
probably
in
reference
to
some
flowers
of
speech
she
had
already
strewn
on
Mr
Chuffey
,
"
even
if
one
calls
'em
names
,
it
's
only
done
to
rouse
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Whatever
epithets
she
had
bestowed
on
the
old
clerk
,
they
had
not
roused
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
beside
the
bed
,
in
the
chair
he
had
occupied
all
the
previous
night
,
with
his
hands
folded
before
him
,
and
his
head
bowed
down
;
and
neither
looked
up
,
on
their
entrance
,
nor
gave
any
sign
of
consciousness
,
until
Mr
Pecksniff
took
him
by
the
arm
,
when
he
meekly
rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Three
score
and
ten

"
said
Chuffey
,
"
ought
and
carry
seven

<EOS>
Some
men
are
so
strong
that
they
live
to
four
score
<EOS>

four
times

four

<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
why
---
why
---
why
did
n't
he
live
to
four
times
ought
's
an

and
four
times
two

eighty

"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
a
wale
of
grief
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
possessing
herself
of
the
bottle
and
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
did
he
die
before
his
poor
old
crazy
servant
?
"
said
Chuffey
,
clasping
his
hands
and
looking
up
in
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
him
from
me
,
and
what
remains
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jonas
,
"
returned
Pecksniff
,
"
Mr
Jonas
,
my
good
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
loved
him
,
"
cried
the
old
man
,
weeping
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
good
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
learnt
Tare
and
Tret
together
at
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
him
down
once
,
six
boys
in
the
arithmetic
class
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
Had
I
the
heart
to
take
him
down
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mr
Chuffey
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Summon
up
your
fortitude
,
Mr
Chuffey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will
,
"
returned
the
old
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
sum
up
my
forty
 
<EOS>
---
How
many
times
forty
---
<EOS>
Oh
,
Chuzzlewit
and
Son
---
Your
own
son
Mr
Chuzzlewit
;
your
own
son
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
yielded
to
the
hand
that
guided
him
,
as
he
lapsed
into
this
familiar
expression
,
and
submitted
to
be
led
away
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
the
bottle
on
one
knee
,
and
the
glass
on
the
other
,
sat
upon
a
stool
,
shaking
her
head
for
a
long
time
,
until
,
in
a
moment
of
abstraction
,
she
poured
out
a
dram
of
spirits
,
and
raised
it
to
her
lips
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
succeeded
by
a
second
,
and
by
a
third
,
and
then
her
eyes
---
either
in
the
sadness
of
her
reflections
upon
life
and
death
,
or
in
her
admiration
of
the
liquor
---
were
so
turned
up
,
as
to
be
quite
invisible
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
shook
her
head
still
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Chuffey
was
conducted
to
his
accustomed
corner
,
and
there
he
remained
,
silent
and
quiet
,
save
at
long
intervals
,
when
he
would
rise
,
and
walk
about
the
room
,
and
wring
his
hands
,
or
raise
some
strange
and
sudden
cry
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
whole
week
they
all
three
sat
about
the
hearth
and
never
stirred
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
would
have
walked
out
in
the
evening
time
,
but
Mr
Jonas
was
so
averse
to
his
being
absent
for
a
minute
,
that
he
abandoned
the
idea
,
and
so
,
from
morning
until
night
,
they
brooded
together
in
the
dark
room
,
without
relief
or
occupation
.
   
<EOS>
The
weight
of
that
which
was
stretched
out
,
stiff
and
stark
,
in
the
awful
chamber
above
-
stairs
,
so
crushed
and
bore
down
Jonas
,
that
he
bent
beneath
the
load
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
whole
long
seven
days
and
nights
,
he
was
always
oppressed
and
haunted
by
a
dreadful
sense
of
its
presence
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Did
the
door
move
,
he
looked
towards
it
with
a
livid
face
and
starting
eye
,
as
if
he
fully
believed
that
ghostly
fingers
clutched
the
handle
.
 
<EOS>
Did
the
fire
fiicker
in
a
draught
of
air
,
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
,
as
almost
dreading
to
behold
some
shrouded
figure
fanning
and
flapping
at
it
with
its
fearful
dress
.
<EOS>
The
lightest
noise
disturbed
him
;
and
once
,
in
the
night
,
at
the
sound
of
a
footstep
overhead
,
he
cried
out
that
the
dead
man
was
walking
---
tramp
,
tramp
,
tramp
---
about
his
coffin
.
   
<EOS>
He
lay
at
night
upon
a
mattress
on
the
floor
of
the
sitting
-
room
;
his
own
chamber
having
been
assigned
to
Mrs
Gamp
;
and
Mr
Pecksniff
was
similarly
accommodated
.
 
<EOS>
The
howling
of
a
dog
before
the
house
,
filled
him
with
a
terror
he
could
not
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
He
avoided
the
reflection
in
the
opposite
windows
of
the
light
that
burned
above
,
as
though
it
had
been
an
angry
eye
.
 
<EOS>
He
often
,
in
every
night
,
rose
up
from
his
fitful
sleep
,
and
looked
and
longed
for
dawn
;
all
directions
and
arrangements
,
even
to
the
ordering
of
their
daily
meals
,
he
abandoned
to
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
That
excellent
gentleman
,
deeming
that
the
mourner
wanted
comfort
,
and
that
high
feeding
was
likely
to
do
him
infinite
service
,
availed
himself
of
these
opportunities
to
such
good
purpose
,
that
they
kept
quite
a
dainty
table
during
this
melancholy
season
;
with
sweetbreads
,
stewed
kidneys
,
oysters
,
and
other
such
light
viands
for
supper
every
night
;
over
which
,
and
sundry
jorums
of
hot
punch
,
Mr
Pecksniff
delivered
such
moral
reflections
and
spiritual
consolation
as
might
have
converted
a
Heathen
---
especially
if
he
had
had
but
an
imperfect
acquaintance
with
the
English
tongue
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
did
Mr
Pecksniff
alone
indulge
in
the
creature
comforts
during
this
sad
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
proved
to
be
very
choice
in
her
eating
,
and
repudiated
hashed
mutton
with
scorn
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
drinking
too
,
she
was
very
punctual
and
particular
,
requiring
a
pint
of
mild
porter
at
lunch
,
a
pint
at
dinner
,
half
-
a
-
pint
as
a
species
of
stay
or
holdfast
between
dinner
and
tea
,
and
a
pint
of
the
celebrated
staggering
ale
,
or
Real
Old
Brighton
Tipper
,
at
supper
;
besides
the
bottle
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
such
casual
invitations
to
refresh
herself
with
wine
as
the
good
breeding
of
her
employers
might
prompt
them
to
offer
.
 
<EOS>
In
like
manner
,
Mr
Mould
's
men
found
it
necessary
to
drown
their
grief
,
like
a
young
kitten
in
the
morning
of
its
existence
,
for
which
reason
they
generally
fuddled
themselves
before
they
began
to
do
anything
,
lest
it
should
make
head
and
get
the
better
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
whole
of
that
strange
week
was
a
round
of
dismal
joviality
and
grim
enjoyment
;
and
every
one
,
except
poor
Chuffey
,
who
came
within
the
shadow
of
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
's
grave
,
feasted
like
a
Ghoul
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
day
of
the
funeral
,
pious
and
truthful
ceremony
that
it
was
,
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mould
,
with
a
glass
of
generous
port
between
his
eye
and
the
light
,
leaned
against
the
desk
in
the
little
glass
office
with
his
gold
watch
in
his
unoccupied
hand
,
and
conversed
with
Mrs
Gamp
;
two
mutes
were
at
the
house
-
door
,
looking
as
mournful
as
could
be
reasonably
expected
of
men
with
such
a
thriving
job
in
hand
;
the
whole
of
Mr
Mould
's
establishment
were
on
duty
within
the
house
or
without
;
feathers
waved
,
horses
snorted
,
silk
and
velvets
fluttered
;
in
a
word
,
as
Mr
Mould
emphatically
said
,
"
Everything
that
money
could
do
was
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
can
do
more
,
Mrs
Gamp
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
undertaker
as
he
emptied
his
glass
and
smacked
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
in
the
world
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
in
the
world
,
"
repeated
Mr
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Mrs
.
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
people
spend
more
money
"
---
here
he
filled
his
glass
again
---
"
upon
a
death
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
than
upon
a
birth
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
that
's
in
your
way
;
you
ought
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
account
for
that
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
is
because
an
undertaker
's
charges
comes
dearer
than
a
nurse
's
charges
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
tittering
,
and
smoothing
down
her
new
black
dress
with
her
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
Mr
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
breakfasting
at
somebody
's
expense
this
morning
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
seeing
,
by
the
aid
of
a
little
shaving
-
glass
which
hung
opposite
,
that
he
looked
merry
,
he
composed
his
features
and
became
sorrowful
.
   
<EOS>
"
Many
's
the
time
that
I
've
not
breakfasted
at
my
own
expense
along
of
your
recommending
,
sir
;
and
many
's
the
time
I
hope
to
do
the
same
in
time
to
come
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
an
apologetic
curtsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
be
it
,
"
replied
Mr
Mould
,
"
please
Providence
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Mrs
Gamp
;
I
'll
tell
you
why
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
because
the
laying
out
of
money
with
a
well
-
conducted
establishment
,
where
the
thing
is
performed
upon
the
very
best
scale
,
binds
the
broken
heart
,
and
sheds
balm
upon
the
wounded
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
Hearts
want
binding
,
and
spirits
want
balming
when
people
die
;
not
when
people
are
born
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
this
gentleman
to
-
day
;
look
at
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
An
open
-
handed
gentleman
?
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
enthusiasm
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
the
undertaker
;
"
not
an
open
-
handed
gentleman
in
general
,
by
any
means
.
 
<EOS>
There
you
mistake
him
;
but
an
afflicted
gentleman
,
an
affectionate
gentleman
,
who
knows
what
it
is
in
the
power
of
money
to
do
,
in
giving
him
relief
,
and
in
testifying
his
love
and
veneration
for
the
departed
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
give
him
,
"
said
Mr
Mould
,
waving
his
watch
-
chain
slowly
round
and
round
,
so
that
he
described
one
circle
after
every
item
;
"
it
can
give
him
four
horses
to
each
vehicle
;
it
can
give
him
velvet
trappings
;
it
can
give
him
drivers
in
cloth
cloaks
and
top
-
boots
;
it
can
give
him
the
plumage
of
the
ostrich
,
dyed
black
;
it
can
give
him
any
number
of
walking
attendants
,
dressed
in
the
first
style
of
funeral
fashion
,
and
carrying
batons
tipped
with
brass
;
it
can
give
him
a
handsome
tomb
;
it
can
give
him
a
place
in
Westminster
Abbey
itself
,
if
he
choose
to
invest
it
in
such
a
purchase
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
do
not
let
us
say
that
gold
is
dross
,
when
it
can
buy
such
things
as
these
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
a
blessing
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
that
there
are
such
as
you
,
to
sell
or
let
'em
out
on
hire
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
you
are
right
,
"
rejoined
the
undertaker
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
should
be
an
honoured
calling
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
good
by
stealth
,
and
blush
to
have
it
mentioned
in
our
little
bills
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
consolation
may
I
---
even
I
,
"
cried
Mr
Mould
,
"
have
diffused
among
my
fellow
-
creatures
by
means
of
my
four
long
-
tailed
prancers
,
never
harnessed
under
ten
pund
ten
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
had
begun
to
make
a
suitable
reply
,
when
she
was
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
one
of
Mr
Mould
's
assistants
---
his
chief
mourner
in
fact
---
an
obese
person
,
with
his
waistcoat
in
closer
connection
with
his
legs
than
is
quite
reconcilable
with
the
established
ideas
of
grace
;
with
that
cast
of
feature
which
is
figuratively
called
a
bottle
nose
;
and
with
a
face
covered
all
over
with
pimples
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
tender
plant
once
upon
a
time
,
but
from
constant
blowing
in
the
fat
atmosphere
of
funerals
,
had
run
to
seed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Tacker
,
"
said
Mr
Mould
,
"
is
all
ready
below
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
beautiful
show
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Tacker
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
horses
are
prouder
and
fresher
than
ever
I
see
'em
;
and
toss
their
heads
,
they
do
,
as
if
they
knowed
how
much
their
plumes
cost
.
 
<EOS>
One
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
"
said
Mr
Tacker
,
heaping
that
number
of
black
cloaks
upon
his
left
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Tom
there
,
with
the
cake
and
wine
?
"
asked
Mr
Mould
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ready
to
come
in
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
sir
,
"
said
Tacker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Mould
,
putting
up
his
watch
,
and
glancing
at
himself
in
the
little
shaving
-
glass
,
that
he
might
be
sure
his
face
had
the
right
expression
on
it
;
"
then
I
think
we
may
proceed
to
business
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
the
paper
of
gloves
,
Tacker
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
what
a
man
he
was
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
Tacker
,
Tacker
,
what
a
man
he
was
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tacker
,
who
from
his
great
experience
in
the
performance
of
funerals
,
would
have
made
an
excellent
pantomime
actor
,
winked
at
Mrs
Gamp
without
at
all
disturbing
the
gravity
of
his
countenance
,
and
followed
his
master
into
the
next
room
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
point
with
Mr
Mould
,
and
a
part
of
his
professional
tact
,
not
to
seem
to
know
the
doctor
;
though
in
reality
they
were
near
neighbours
,
and
very
often
,
as
in
the
present
instance
,
worked
together
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
advanced
to
fit
on
his
black
kid
gloves
as
if
he
had
never
seen
him
in
all
his
life
;
while
the
doctor
,
on
his
part
,
looked
as
distant
and
unconscious
as
if
he
had
heard
and
read
of
undertakers
,
and
had
passed
their
shops
,
but
had
never
before
been
brought
into
communication
with
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gloves
,
eh
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pecksniff
after
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
think
of
it
,
"
returned
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
taking
a
pair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
as
I
was
saying
---
I
was
called
up
to
attend
that
case
at
about
half
-
past
one
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Cake
and
wine
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Which
is
port
?
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
took
some
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
about
half
-
past
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
sir
,
"
resumed
the
doctor
,
"
I
was
called
up
to
attend
that
case
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
first
pull
of
the
night
-
bell
<EOS>
I
turned
out
,
threw
up
the
window
,
and
put
out
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
Cloak
,
eh
?
 
Do
n't
tie
it
too
tight
.
 
<EOS>
That
'll
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
having
been
likewise
inducted
into
a
similar
garment
,
the
doctor
resumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
put
out
my
head
---
hat
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
My
good
friend
,
that
is
not
mine
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
I
think
we
have
unintentionally
made
an
exchange
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
I
was
going
to
tell
you
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
quite
ready
,
"
interrupted
Mould
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ready
,
eh
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
I
'll
take
an
opportunity
of
relating
the
rest
in
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
rather
curious
.
 
<EOS>
Ready
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
No
rain
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Quite
fair
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mould
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
the
ground
would
have
been
wet
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
for
my
glass
fell
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
congratulate
ourselves
upon
our
good
fortune
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
seeing
by
this
time
that
Mr
Jonas
and
Chuffey
were
going
out
at
the
door
,
he
put
a
white
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
his
face
as
if
a
violent
burst
of
grief
had
suddenly
come
upon
him
,
and
walked
down
side
by
side
with
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mould
and
his
men
had
not
exaggerated
the
grandeur
of
the
arrangements
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
splendid
.
 
<EOS>
The
four
hearse
-
horses
,
especially
,
reared
and
pranced
,
and
showed
their
highest
action
,
as
if
they
knew
a
man
was
dead
,
and
triumphed
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
break
us
,
drive
us
,
ride
us
;
ill
-
treat
,
abuse
,
and
maim
us
for
their
pleasure
---
But
they
die
;
Hurrah
,
they
die
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
through
the
narrow
streets
and
winding
city
ways
,
went
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
's
funeral
;
Mr
Jonas
glancing
stealthily
out
of
the
coach
-
window
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
observe
its
effect
upon
the
crowd
;
Mr
Mould
as
he
walked
along
,
listening
with
a
sober
pride
to
the
exclamations
of
the
bystanders
;
the
doctor
whispering
his
story
to
Mr
Pecksniff
,
without
appearing
to
come
any
nearer
the
end
of
it
;
and
poor
old
Chuffey
sobbing
unregarded
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
greatly
scandalized
Mr
Mould
at
an
early
stage
of
the
ceremony
by
carrying
his
handkerchief
in
his
hat
in
a
perfectly
informal
manner
,
and
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
knuckles
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
Mr
Mould
himself
had
said
already
,
his
behaviour
was
indecent
,
and
quite
unworthy
of
such
an
occasion
;
and
he
never
ought
to
have
been
there
.
   
<EOS>
There
he
was
,
however
;
and
in
the
churchyard
there
he
was
,
also
,
conducting
himself
in
a
no
less
unbecoming
manner
,
and
leaning
for
support
on
Tacker
,
who
plainly
told
him
that
he
was
fit
for
nothing
better
than
a
walking
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
But
Chuffey
,
Heaven
help
him
!
<EOS>
heard
no
sound
but
<EOS>
the
echoes
,
lingering
in
his
own
heart
,
of
a
voice
for
ever
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
loved
him
,
"
cried
the
old
man
,
sinking
down
upon
the
grave
when
all
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
very
good
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
dear
old
friend
and
master
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Mr
Chuffey
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
<EOS>
this
wo
n't
do
;
it
's
a
clayey
soil
,
Mr
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
n't
,
really
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
been
the
commonest
thing
we
do
,
and
Mr
Chuffey
had
been
a
Bearer
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mould
,
casting
an
imploring
glance
upon
them
,
as
he
helped
to
raise
him
,
"
he
could
n't
have
gone
on
worse
than
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
a
man
,
Mr
Chuffey
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
a
gentleman
,
Mr
Chuffey
,
"
said
Mould
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
my
good
friend
,
"
murmured
the
doctor
,
in
a
tone
of
stately
reproof
,
as
he
stepped
up
to
the
old
man
's
side
,
"
this
is
worse
than
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
bad
,
selfish
,
very
wrong
,
Mr
Chuffey
.
<EOS>
You
should
take
example
from
others
,
my
good
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
forget
that
you
were
not
connected
by
ties
of
blood
with
our
deceased
friend
;
and
that
he
had
a
very
near
and
very
dear
relation
,
Mr
Chuffey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
his
own
son
!
"
cried
the
old
man
,
clasping
his
hands
with
remarkable
passion
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
own
,
own
,
only
son
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
right
in
his
head
,
you
know
,
"
said
Jonas
,
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
to
mind
anything
he
says
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
was
to
talk
some
precious
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
mind
him
,
any
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
left
him
to
my
charge
;
and
whatever
he
says
or
does
,
that
's
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
care
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
hum
of
admiration
rose
from
the
mourners
(
including
Mr
Mould
and
his
merry
men
)
at
this
new
instance
of
magnanimity
and
kind
feeling
on
the
part
of
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
But
Chuffey
put
it
to
the
test
no
farther
.
<EOS>
He
said
not
a
word
more
,
and
being
left
to
himself
for
a
little
while
,
crept
back
again
to
the
coach
.
   
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
that
Mr
Jonas
turned
pale
when
the
behaviour
of
the
old
clerk
attracted
general
attention
;
his
discomposure
,
however
,
was
but
momentary
,
and
he
soon
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
were
not
the
only
changes
he
had
exhibited
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
curious
eyes
of
Mr
Pecksniff
had
observed
that
as
soon
as
they
left
the
house
upon
their
mournful
errand
,
he
began
to
mend
;
that
as
the
ceremonies
proceeded
he
gradually
,
by
little
and
little
,
recovered
his
old
condition
,
his
old
looks
,
his
old
bearing
,
his
old
agreeable
characteristics
of
speech
and
manner
,
and
became
,
in
all
respects
,
his
old
pleasant
self
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
that
they
were
seated
in
the
coach
on
their
return
home
;
and
more
when
they
got
there
,
and
found
the
windows
open
,
the
light
and
air
admitted
,
and
all
traces
of
the
late
event
removed
;
he
felt
so
well
convinced
that
Jonas
was
again
the
Jonas
he
had
known
a
week
ago
,
and
not
the
Jonas
of
the
intervening
time
,
that
he
voluntarily
gave
up
his
recently
-
acquired
power
without
one
faint
attempt
to
exercise
it
,
and
at
once
fell
back
into
his
former
position
of
mild
and
deferential
guest
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
went
home
to
the
bird
-
fancier
's
,
and
was
knocked
up
again
that
very
night
for
a
birth
of
twins
;
Mr
Mould
dined
gaily
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
,
and
passed
the
evening
facetiously
at
his
club
;
the
hearse
,
after
standing
for
a
long
time
at
the
door
of
a
roistering
public
-
house
,
repaired
to
its
stables
with
the
feathers
inside
and
twelve
red
-
nosed
undertakers
on
the
roof
,
each
holding
on
by
a
dingy
peg
,
to
which
,
in
times
of
state
,
a
waving
plume
was
fitted
;
the
various
trappings
of
sorrow
were
carefully
laid
by
in
presses
for
the
next
hirer
;
the
fiery
steeds
were
quenched
and
quiet
in
their
stalls
;
the
doctor
got
merry
with
wine
at
a
wedding
-
dinner
,
and
forgot
the
middle
of
the
story
which
had
no
end
to
it
;
the
pageant
of
a
few
short
hours
ago
was
written
nowhere
half
so
legibly
as
in
the
undertaker
's
books
.
   
<EOS>
Not
in
the
churchyard
?
 
<EOS>
Not
even
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
gates
were
closed
;
the
night
was
dark
and
wet
;
the
rain
fell
silently
,
among
the
stagnant
weeds
and
nettles
.
 
<EOS>
One
new
mound
was
there
which
had
not
been
there
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
Time
,
burrowing
like
a
mole
below
the
ground
,
had
marked
his
track
by
throwing
up
another
heap
of
earth
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
was
all
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
20
.
<EOS>
Is
a
chapter
of
love
 
"
Pecksniff
,
"
said
Jonas
,
taking
off
his
hat
,
to
see
that
the
black
crape
band
was
all
right
;
and
finding
that
it
was
,
putting
it
on
again
,
complacently
;
"
what
do
you
mean
to
give
your
daughters
when
they
marry
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Jonas
,
"
cried
the
affectionate
parent
,
with
an
ingenuous
smile
,
"
what
a
very
singular
inquiry
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
you
mind
whether
it
's
a
singular
inquiry
or
a
plural
one
,
"
retorted
Jonas
,
eyeing
Mr
Pecksniff
with
no
great
favour
,
"
but
answer
it
,
or
let
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
 
<EOS>
The
question
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
laying
his
hand
tenderly
upon
his
kinsman
's
knee
,
"
is
involved
with
many
considerations
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
I
give
them
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
would
you
give
'
em
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
would
naturally
depend
in
a
great
measure
upon
the
kind
of
husbands
they
might
choose
,
my
dear
young
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
was
evidently
disconcerted
,
and
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
answer
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
deep
one
,
but
such
is
the
wisdom
of
simplicity
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
standard
for
the
merits
I
would
require
in
a
son
-
in
-
law
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
after
a
short
silence
,
"
is
a
high
one
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
my
dear
Mr
Jonas
,
"
he
added
,
greatly
moved
,
"
if
I
say
that
you
have
spoiled
me
,
and
made
it
a
fanciful
one
;
an
imaginative
one
;
a
prismatically
tinged
one
,
if
I
may
be
permitted
to
call
it
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
growled
Jonas
,
looking
at
him
with
increased
disfavour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
you
may
well
inquire
.
<EOS>
The
heart
is
not
always
a
royal
mint
,
with
patent
machinery
to
work
its
metal
into
current
coin
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
it
throws
it
out
in
strange
forms
,
not
easily
recognized
as
coin
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
sterling
gold
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
at
least
that
merit
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
sterling
gold
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
<EOS>
grumbled
Jonas
,
with
a
doubtful
shake
of
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
warming
with
his
subject
<EOS>
"
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
plain
with
you
,
Mr
Jonas
,
if
I
could
find
two
such
sons
-
in
-
law
as
you
will
one
day
make
to
some
deserving
man
,
capable
of
appreciating
a
nature
such
as
yours
,
I
would
---
forgetful
of
myself
---
<EOS>
bestow
upon
my
daughters
portions
reaching
to
the
very
utmost
limit
of
my
means
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
strong
language
,
and
it
was
earnestly
delivered
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
can
wonder
that
such
a
man
as
Mr
Pecksniff
,
after
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
of
Mr
Jonas
,
should
be
strong
and
earnest
upon
such
a
theme
;
a
theme
that
touched
even
the
worldly
lips
of
undertakers
with
the
honey
of
eloquence
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
was
silent
,
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
For
they
were
seated
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
,
at
the
back
,
and
were
travelling
down
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
accompanied
Mr
Pecksniff
home
for
a
few
days
'
change
of
air
and
scene
after
his
recent
trials
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
he
said
,
at
last
,
with
captivating
bluntness
,
"
suppose
you
got
one
such
son
-
in
-
law
as
me
,
what
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
regarded
him
at
first
with
inexpressible
surprise
;
then
gradually
breaking
into
a
sort
of
dejected
vivacity
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Then
well
I
know
whose
husband
he
would
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whose
?
"
asked
Jonas
,
drily
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
eldest
girl
's
,
Mr
Jonas
,
"
replied
Pecksniff
,
with
moistening
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Cherry
's
;
my
staff
,
my
scrip
,
my
treasure
,
Mr
Jonas
.
<EOS>
A
hard
struggle
,
but
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
one
day
part
with
her
to
a
husband
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
,
my
dear
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
prepared
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
<EOS>
you
've
been
prepared
for
that
a
pretty
long
time
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Many
have
sought
to
bear
her
from
me
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
have
failed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
give
my
hand
,
papa
"
---
those
were
her
words
---
"
unless
my
heart
is
won
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
has
not
been
quite
so
happy
as
she
used
to
be
,
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Mr
Jonas
looked
at
the
landscape
;
then
at
the
coachman
;
then
at
the
luggage
on
the
roof
;
finally
at
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
'll
have
to
part
with
the
other
one
,
some
of
these
days
?
"
<EOS>
he
observed
,
as
he
caught
that
gentleman
's
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
Probably
,
"
said
the
parent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Years
will
tame
down
the
wildness
of
my
foolish
bird
,
and
then
it
will
be
caged
.
 
<EOS>
But
Cherry
,
Mr
Jonas
,
Cherry
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
ah
!
"
interrupted
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Years
have
made
her
all
right
enough
.
<EOS>
Nobody
doubts
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
n't
answered
what
I
asked
you
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
you
're
not
obliged
to
do
it
,
you
know
,
if
you
do
n't
like
.
<EOS>
You
're
the
best
judge
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
warning
sulkiness
in
the
manner
of
this
speech
,
which
admonished
Mr
Pecksniff
that
his
dear
friend
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
or
fenced
off
,
and
that
he
must
either
return
a
straight
-
forward
reply
to
his
question
,
or
plainly
give
him
to
understand
that
he
declined
to
enlighten
him
upon
the
subject
to
which
it
referred
.
 
<EOS>
Mindful
in
this
dilemma
of
the
caution
<EOS>
old
Anthony
had
given
him
almost
with
his
latest
breath
,
he
resolved
to
speak
to
the
point
,
and
so
told
Mr
Jonas
(
enlarging
upon
the
communication
as
a
proof
of
his
great
attachment
and
confidence
)
,
that
in
the
case
he
had
put
;
to
wit
,
in
the
event
of
such
a
man
as
he
proposing
for
his
daughter
's
hand
,
he
would
endow
her
with
a
fortune
of
four
thousand
pounds
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
sadly
pinch
and
cramp
myself
to
do
so
,
"
was
his
fatherly
remark
;
"
but
that
would
be
my
duty
,
and
my
conscience
would
reward
me
.
 
<EOS>
For
myself
,
my
conscience
is
my
bank
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
trifle
invested
there
---
a
mere
trifle
,
Mr
Jonas
---
<EOS>
but
I
prize
it
as
a
store
of
value
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
good
man
's
enemies
would
have
divided
upon
this
question
into
two
parties
.
 
<EOS>
One
would
have
asserted
without
scruple
that
if
Mr
Pecksniff
's
conscience
were
his
bank
,
and
he
kept
a
running
account
there
,
he
must
have
overdrawn
it
beyond
all
mortal
means
of
computation
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
would
have
contended
that
it
was
a
mere
fictitious
form
;
a
perfectly
blank
book
;
or
one
in
which
entries
were
only
made
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
invisible
ink
to
become
legible
at
some
indefinite
time
;
and
that
he
never
troubled
it
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
sadly
pinch
and
cramp
me
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
but
Providence
---
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
be
permitted
to
say
a
special
Providence
---
has
blessed
my
endeavours
,
and
I
could
guarantee
to
make
the
sacrifice
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
question
of
philosophy
arises
here
,
whether
Mr
Pecksniff
had
or
had
not
good
reason
to
say
that
he
was
specially
patronized
and
encouraged
in
his
undertakings
.
 
<EOS>
All
his
life
long
he
had
been
walking
up
and
down
the
narrow
ways
and
by
-
places
,
with
a
hook
in
one
hand
and
a
crook
in
the
other
,
scraping
all
sorts
of
valuable
odds
and
ends
into
his
pouch
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
there
being
a
special
Providence
in
the
fall
of
a
sparrow
<EOS>
,
it
follows
(
so
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
only
such
admirable
men
,
would
have
reasoned
)
,
that
there
must
also
be
a
special
Providence
in
the
alighting
of
the
stone
or
stick
,
or
other
substance
which
is
aimed
at
the
sparrow
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Pecksniff
's
hook
,
or
crook
,
having
invariably
knocked
the
sparrow
on
the
head
and
brought
him
down
,
that
gentleman
may
have
been
led
to
consider
himself
as
specially
licensed
to
bag
sparrows
,
and
as
being
specially
seized
and
possessed
of
all
the
birds
he
had
got
together
.
 
<EOS>
That
many
undertakings
,
national
as
well
as
individual
---
but
especially
the
former
---
are
held
to
be
specially
brought
to
a
glorious
and
successful
issue
,
which
never
could
be
so
regarded
on
any
other
process
of
reasoning
,
<EOS>
must
be
clear
to
all
men
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
the
precedents
would
seem
to
show
that
Mr
Pecksniff
had
(
as
things
go
)
good
argument
for
what
he
said
and
might
be
permitted
to
say
it
,
and
did
not
say
it
presumptuously
,
vainly
,
or
arrogantly
,
but
in
a
spirit
of
high
faith
and
great
wisdom
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
,
not
being
much
accustomed
to
perplex
his
mind
with
theories
of
this
nature
,
expressed
no
opinion
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
receive
his
companion
's
announcement
with
one
solitary
syllable
,
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
.
 
<EOS>
He
preserved
this
taciturnity
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
least
,
and
during
the
whole
of
that
time
appeared
to
be
steadily
engaged
in
subjecting
some
given
amount
to
the
operation
of
every
known
rule
in
figures
;
adding
to
it
,
taking
from
it
,
multiplying
it
,
reducing
it
by
long
and
short
division
;
working
it
by
the
rule
-
of
-
three
direct
and
inversed
;
exchange
or
barter
;
practice
;
simple
interest
;
compound
interest
;
and
other
means
of
arithmetical
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
of
these
labours
appeared
to
be
satisfactory
,
for
when
he
did
break
silence
,
it
was
as
one
who
had
arrived
at
some
specific
result
,
and
freed
himself
from
a
state
of
distressing
uncertainty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
old
Pecksniff
!
"
<EOS>
---
Such
was
his
jocose
address
,
as
he
slapped
that
gentleman
on
the
back
,
at
the
end
of
the
stage
---
"
let
's
have
something
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
's
treat
the
driver
,
"
cried
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
it
wo
n't
hurt
the
man
,
or
render
him
discontented
with
his
station
---
certainly
,
"
faltered
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
only
laughed
at
this
,
and
getting
down
from
the
coach
-
top
with
great
alacrity
,
cut
a
cumbersome
kind
of
caper
in
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
he
went
into
the
public
-
house
,
and
there
ordered
spirituous
drink
to
such
an
extent
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
had
some
doubts
of
his
perfect
sanity
,
until
Jonas
set
them
quite
at
rest
by
saying
,
when
the
coach
could
wait
no
longer
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
standing
treat
for
a
whole
week
and
more
,
and
letting
you
have
all
the
delicacies
of
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
YOU
shall
pay
for
this
Pecksniff
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
joke
either
,
as
Mr
Pecksniff
at
first
supposed
;
for
he
went
off
to
the
coach
without
further
ceremony
,
and
left
his
respected
victim
to
settle
the
bill
.
   
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pecksniff
was
a
man
of
meek
endurance
,
and
Mr
Jonas
was
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
his
regard
for
that
gentleman
was
founded
,
as
we
know
,
on
pure
esteem
,
and
a
knowledge
of
the
excellence
of
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
out
from
the
tavern
with
a
smiling
face
,
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
repeat
the
performance
,
on
a
less
expensive
scale
,
at
the
next
ale
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
wildness
in
the
spirits
of
Mr
Jonas
(
not
usually
a
part
of
his
character
)
which
was
far
from
being
subdued
by
these
means
,
and
,
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
,
he
was
so
very
buoyant
---
it
may
be
said
,
boisterous
---
that
Mr
Pecksniff
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
pace
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
not
expected
---
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
proposed
in
London
to
give
the
girls
a
surprise
,
and
had
said
he
would
n't
write
a
word
to
prepare
them
on
any
account
,
in
order
that
he
and
Mr
Jonas
might
take
them
unawares
,
and
just
see
what
they
were
doing
,
when
they
thought
their
dear
papa
was
miles
and
miles
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
consequence
of
this
playful
device
,
there
was
nobody
to
meet
them
at
the
finger
-
post
,
but
that
was
of
small
consequence
,
for
they
had
come
down
by
the
day
coach
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
had
only
a
carpetbag
,
while
Mr
Jonas
had
only
a
portmanteau
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
the
portmanteau
between
them
,
put
the
bag
upon
it
,
and
walked
off
up
the
lane
without
delay
;
Mr
Pecksniff
already
going
on
tiptoe
as
if
,
without
this
precaution
,
his
fond
children
,
being
then
at
a
distance
of
a
couple
of
miles
or
so
,
would
have
some
filial
sense
of
his
approach
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
lovely
evening
in
the
spring
-
time
of
the
year
;
and
in
the
soft
stillness
of
the
twilight
,
all
nature
was
very
calm
and
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
had
been
fine
and
warm
;
but
at
the
coming
on
of
night
,
the
air
grew
cool
,
and
in
the
mellowing
distance
smoke
was
rising
gently
from
the
cottage
chimneys
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
thousand
pleasant
scents
diffused
around
,
from
young
leaves
and
fresh
buds
;
the
cuckoo
had
been
singing
all
day
long
,
and
was
but
just
now
hushed
;
the
smell
of
earth
newly
-
upturned
,
first
breath
of
hope
to
the
first
labourer
after
his
garden
withered
,
was
fragrant
in
the
evening
breeze
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
time
when
most
men
cherish
good
resolves
,
and
sorrow
for
the
wasted
past
;
when
most
men
,
looking
on
the
shadows
as
they
gather
,
think
of
that
evening
which
must
close
on
all
,
and
that
to
-
morrow
which
has
none
beyond
.
   
<EOS>
"
Precious
dull
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
looking
about
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
enough
to
make
a
man
go
melancholy
mad
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
lights
and
a
fire
soon
,
"
observed
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
need
'em
by
the
time
we
get
there
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
the
devil
do
n't
you
talk
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
thinking
of
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
Mr
Jonas
,
"
said
Pecksniff
with
great
solemnity
,
"
my
mind
was
running
at
that
moment
on
our
late
dear
friend
,
your
departed
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
immediately
let
his
burden
fall
,
and
said
,
threatening
him
with
his
hand
:
   
<EOS>
"
Drop
that
,
Pecksniff
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
not
exactly
knowing
whether
allusion
was
made
to
the
subject
or
the
portmanteau
,
stared
at
his
friend
in
unaffected
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drop
it
,
I
say
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
?
 
<EOS>
Drop
it
,
now
and
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
,
I
give
you
notice
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
quite
a
mistake
,
"
urged
Mr
Pecksniff
,
very
much
dismayed
;
"
though
I
admit
it
was
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
known
it
was
a
tender
string
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
about
tender
strings
,
"
said
Jonas
,
wiping
his
forehead
with
the
cuff
of
his
coat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
be
crowed
over
by
you
,
because
I
do
n't
like
dead
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
got
out
the
words
"
Crowed
over
,
Mr
Jonas
!
"
<EOS>
when
that
young
man
,
with
a
dark
expression
in
his
countenance
,
cut
him
short
once
more
:
   
"
Mind
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
advise
you
not
to
revive
the
subject
,
neither
to
me
nor
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
take
a
hint
,
if
you
choose
as
well
as
another
man
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
enough
said
about
it
.
<EOS>
Come
along
!
"
   
<EOS>
Taking
up
his
part
of
the
load
again
,
when
he
had
said
these
words
,
he
hurried
on
so
fast
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
portmanteau
,
found
himself
dragged
forward
,
in
a
very
inconvenient
and
ungraceful
manner
,
to
the
great
detriment
of
what
is
called
by
fancy
gentlemen
"
the
bark
"
upon
his
shins
,
which
were
most
unmercifully
bumped
against
the
hard
leather
and
the
iron
buckles
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
,
however
,
Mr
Jonas
relaxed
his
speed
,
and
suffered
his
companion
to
come
up
with
him
,
and
to
bring
the
portmanteau
into
a
tolerably
straight
position
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
clear
that
he
regretted
his
late
outbreak
,
and
that
he
mistrusted
its
effect
on
Mr
Pecksniff
;
for
as
often
as
that
gentleman
glanced
towards
Mr
Jonas
,
he
found
Mr
Jonas
glancing
at
him
,
which
was
a
new
source
of
embarrassment
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
short
-
lived
one
,
though
,
for
Mr
Jonas
soon
began
to
whistle
,
whereupon
Mr
Pecksniff
,
taking
his
cue
from
his
friend
,
began
to
hum
a
tune
melodiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
nearly
there
,
ai
n't
we
?
"
<EOS>
said
Jonas
,
when
this
had
lasted
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Close
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
'll
they
be
doing
,
do
you
suppose
?
"
asked
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Impossible
to
say
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Giddy
truants
!
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
away
from
home
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
---
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
---
I
was
going
to
propose
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
that
we
should
enter
by
the
back
way
,
and
come
upon
them
like
a
clap
of
thunder
,
Mr
Jonas
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
might
not
have
been
easy
to
decide
in
respect
of
which
of
their
manifold
properties
,
Jonas
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
the
carpet
-
bag
,
and
the
portmanteau
,
could
be
likened
to
a
clap
of
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Jonas
giving
his
assent
to
this
proposal
,
they
stole
round
into
the
back
yard
,
and
softly
advanced
towards
the
kitchen
window
,
through
which
the
mingled
light
of
fire
and
candle
shone
upon
the
darkening
night
.
   
<EOS>
Truly
Mr
Pecksniff
is
blessed
in
his
children
---
in
one
of
them
,
at
any
rate
.
 
<EOS>
The
prudent
Cherry
---
staff
and
scrip
,
and
treasure
of
her
doting
father
<EOS>
---
there
she
sits
,
at
a
little
table
white
as
driven
snow
,
before
the
kitchen
fire
,
making
up
accounts
!
 
<EOS>
See
the
neat
maiden
,
as
with
pen
in
hand
,
and
calculating
look
addressed
towards
the
ceiling
and
bunch
of
keys
within
a
little
basket
at
her
side
,
she
checks
the
housekeeping
expenditure
!
 
<EOS>
From
flat
-
iron
,
dish
-
cover
,
and
warming
-
pan
;
from
pot
and
kettle
,
face
of
brass
footman
,
and
black
-
leaded
stove
;
bright
glances
of
approbation
wink
and
glow
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
onions
dangling
from
the
beam
,
mantle
and
shine
like
cherubs
'
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
Something
of
the
influence
of
those
vegetables
sinks
into
Mr
Pecksniff
's
nature
.
 
<EOS>
He
weeps
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
<EOS>
but
for
a
moment
,
and
he
hides
it
from
the
observation
of
his
friend
---
very
carefully
---
by
a
somewhat
elaborate
use
of
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
<EOS>
,
in
fact
;
for
he
would
not
have
his
weakness
known
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pleasant
,
"
he
murmured
,
"
pleasant
to
a
father
's
feelings
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
!
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
let
her
know
we
are
here
,
Mr
Jonas
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
suppose
you
do
n't
mean
to
spend
the
evening
in
the
stable
,
or
the
coach
-
house
,
"
he
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
indeed
,
is
not
such
hospitality
as
I
would
show
to
YOU
,
my
friend
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
pressing
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
took
a
long
breath
,
and
tapping
at
the
window
,
shouted
with
stentorian
blandness
:
   
"
Boh
!
"
   
<EOS>
Cherry
dropped
her
pen
and
screamed
.
 
<EOS>
But
innocence
is
ever
bold
,
or
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
opened
the
door
,
the
valiant
girl
exclaimed
in
a
firm
voice
,
and
with
a
presence
of
mind
which
even
in
that
trying
moment
did
not
desert
her
,
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
or
I
will
call
my
Pa.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
held
out
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
him
instantly
,
and
rushed
into
his
fond
embrace
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
thoughtless
of
us
,
Mr
Jonas
,
it
was
very
thoughtless
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
smoothing
his
daugther
's
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
darling
,
do
you
see
that
I
am
not
alone
!
"
   
<EOS>
Not
she
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
seen
nothing
but
her
father
until
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
Mr
Jonas
now
,
though
;
and
blushed
,
and
hung
her
head
down
,
as
she
gave
him
welcome
.
   
<EOS>
But
where
was
Merry
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
did
n't
ask
the
question
in
reproach
,
but
in
a
vein
of
mildness
touched
with
a
gentle
sorrow
.
<EOS>
She
was
upstairs
,
reading
on
the
parlour
couch
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Domestic
details
had
no
charms
for
HER
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
call
her
down
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
placid
resignation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Call
her
down
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
called
and
came
,
all
flushed
and
tumbled
from
reposing
on
the
sofa
;
but
none
the
worse
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Rather
the
better
,
if
anything
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
goodness
me
!
"
cried
the
arch
girl
,
turning
to
her
cousin
when
she
had
kissed
her
father
on
both
cheeks
,
and
in
her
frolicsome
nature
had
bestowed
a
supernumerary
salute
upon
the
tip
of
his
nose
,
"
YOU
here
,
fright
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'm
very
thankful
that
you
wo
n't
trouble
ME
much
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
're
as
lively
as
ever
,
are
you
?
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
wicked
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
go
along
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Merry
,
pushing
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
ever
do
,
if
I
have
to
see
much
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Go
along
,
for
gracious
'
sake
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
striking
in
here
,
with
a
request
that
Mr
Jonas
would
immediately
walk
upstairs
,
he
so
far
complied
with
the
young
lady
's
adjuration
as
to
go
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
he
had
the
fair
Cherry
on
his
arm
,
he
could
not
help
looking
back
at
her
sister
,
and
exchanging
some
further
dialogue
of
the
same
bantering
description
,
as
they
all
four
ascended
to
the
parlour
;
where
---
for
the
young
ladies
happened
,
by
good
fortune
,
to
be
a
little
later
than
usual
<EOS>
that
night
---
the
tea
-
board
was
at
that
moment
being
set
out
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
was
not
at
home
,
so
they
had
it
all
to
themselves
,
and
were
very
snug
and
talkative
,
<EOS>
Jonas
sitting
between
the
two
sisters
,
and
displaying
his
gallantry
in
that
engaging
manner
which
was
peculiar
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
hard
thing
,
Mr
Pecksniff
said
,
when
tea
was
done
,
and
cleared
away
,
to
leave
so
pleasant
a
little
party
,
but
having
some
important
papers
to
examine
in
his
own
apartment
,
he
must
beg
them
to
excuse
him
for
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
apology
he
withdrew
,
singing
a
careless
strain
as
he
went
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
gone
five
minutes
,
when
Merry
,
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
window
,
apart
from
Jonas
and
her
sister
,
burst
into
a
half
-
smothered
laugh
,
and
skipped
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
cried
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
dare
say
!
"
rejoined
Merry
,
looking
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
anxious
I
should
stay
,
fright
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
as
she
left
the
room
notwithstanding
,
he
ran
out
after
her
,
and
brought
her
back
,
after
a
short
struggle
in
the
passage
which
scandalized
Miss
Cherry
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Merry
,
"
urged
that
young
lady
,
"
I
wonder
at
you
!
<EOS>
There
are
bounds
even
to
absurdity
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
sweet
,
"
said
Merry
,
pursing
up
her
rosy
Lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
obliged
to
it
for
its
advice
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
do
leave
me
alone
,
you
monster
,
do
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
entreaty
was
wrung
from
her
by
a
new
proceeding
on
the
part
of
Mr
Jonas
,
who
pulled
her
down
,
all
breathless
as
she
was
,
into
a
seat
beside
him
on
the
sofa
,
having
at
the
same
time
Miss
Cherry
upon
the
other
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Jonas
,
clasping
the
waist
of
each
;
"
I
have
got
both
arms
full
,
have
n't
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
of
them
will
be
black
and
blue
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
do
n't
let
me
go
,
"
cried
the
playful
Merry
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
YOUR
pinching
,
"
grinned
Jonas
,
"
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pinch
him
for
me
,
Cherry
,
pray
,
"
said
Mercy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
did
hate
anybody
so
much
as
I
hate
this
creature
,
I
declare
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
do
n't
say
that
,
"
urged
Jonas
,
"
and
do
n't
pinch
either
,
because
I
want
to
be
serious
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
---
<EOS>
Cousin
Charity
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
she
answered
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
have
some
sober
talk
,
"
said
Jonas
;
"
I
want
to
prevent
any
mistakes
,
you
know
,
and
to
put
everything
upon
a
pleasant
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
desirable
and
proper
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Neither
of
the
sisters
spoke
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
paused
and
cleared
his
throat
,
which
was
very
dry
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
'll
not
believe
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
will
she
,
cousin
?
"
said
Jonas
,
timidly
squeezing
Miss
Charity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
,
Mr
Jonas
,
I
do
n't
know
,
until
I
hear
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
quite
impossible
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
"
said
Jonas
,
"
her
way
always
being
to
make
game
of
people
<EOS>
,
I
know
she
'll
laugh
,
or
pretend
to
---
I
know
that
,
beforehand
.
<EOS>
But
you
can
tell
her
I
'm
in
earnest
,
cousin
;
ca
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
confess
you
know
,
wo
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
honourable
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
he
added
persuasively
.
   
<EOS>
No
answer
.
 
<EOS>
His
throat
seemed
to
grow
hotter
and
hotter
,
and
to
be
more
and
more
difficult
of
control
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Cousin
Charity
,
"
said
Jonas
,
"
nobody
<EOS>
but
you
can
tell
her
<EOS>
what
pains
I
took
to
get
into
her
company
when
you
were
both
at
the
boarding
-
house
in
the
city
,
because
nobody
's
so
well
aware
of
it
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
else
can
tell
her
how
hard
I
tried
to
get
to
know
you
better
,
in
order
that
I
might
get
to
know
her
without
seeming
to
wish
it
;
can
they
?
 
<EOS>
I
always
asked
you
about
her
,
and
said
where
had
she
gone
,
and
when
would
she
come
,
and
how
lively
she
was
,
and
all
that
<EOS>
;
did
n't
I
,
cousin
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
'll
tell
her
<EOS>
so
,
if
you
have
n't
told
her
so
already
,
and
---
<EOS>
and
---
I
dare
say
you
have
,
because
I
'm
sure
you
're
honourable
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Still
not
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
The
right
arm
of
Mr
Jonas
---
the
elder
sister
sat
upon
his
right
---
may
have
been
sensible
of
some
tumultuous
throbbing
which
was
not
within
itself
;
but
nothing
else
apprised
him
that
his
words
had
had
the
least
effect
.
   
<EOS>
"
Even
if
you
kept
it
to
yourself
,
and
have
n't
told
her
,
"
resumed
Jonas
,
"
it
do
n't
much
matter
,
because
you
'll
bear
honest
witness
now
;
wo
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
We
've
been
very
good
friends
from
the
first
;
have
n't
we
?
<EOS>
and
of
course
we
shall
be
quite
friends
in
future
,
and
so
I
do
n't
mind
speaking
before
you
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
Cousin
Mercy
,
you
've
heard
what
I
've
been
saying
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
confirm
it
,
every
word
;
she
must
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
me
for
your
husband
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
released
his
hold
of
Charity
,
to
put
this
question
with
better
effect
,
she
started
up
and
hurried
away
to
her
own
room
,
marking
her
progress
as
she
went
by
such
a
train
of
passionate
and
incoherent
sound
,
as
nothing
but
a
slighted
woman
in
her
anger
could
produce
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
go
after
her
,
"
said
Merry
,
pushing
him
off
,
and
giving
him
---
to
tell
the
truth
---
more
than
one
sounding
slap
upon
his
outstretched
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
till
you
say
yes
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
n't
told
me
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
me
for
your
husband
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
the
sight
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
so
a
hundred
times
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
fright
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
always
thought
you
liked
my
sister
best
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
thought
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
that
was
n't
my
fault
,
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
it
was
;
you
know
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Any
trick
is
fair
in
love
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
may
have
thought
I
liked
her
best
,
but
you
did
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
could
have
thought
I
liked
her
best
,
when
you
were
by
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
accounting
for
tastes
,
"
said
Merry
;
"
at
least
I
did
n't
mean
to
say
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
go
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
and
then
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
ever
brought
myself
to
say
so
,
it
should
only
be
that
I
might
hate
and
tease
you
all
my
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
as
good
,
"
cried
Jonas
,
"
as
saying
it
right
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
bargain
,
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
a
pair
,
if
ever
there
was
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
gallant
speech
was
succeeded
by
a
confused
noise
of
kissing
and
slapping
;
and
then
the
fair
but
much
dishevelled
Merry
broke
away
,
and
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
her
sister
.
   
<EOS>
Now
whether
Mr
Pecksniff
had
been
listening
---
which
in
one
of
his
character
appears
impossible
;
or
divined
almost
by
inspiration
what
the
matter
was
---
which
,
in
a
man
of
his
sagacity
is
far
more
probable
;
or
happened
by
sheer
good
fortune
to
find
himself
in
exactly
the
right
place
,
at
precisely
the
right
time
---
which
,
under
the
special
guardianship
in
which
he
lived
might
very
reasonably
happen
;
it
is
quite
certain
that
at
the
moment
when
the
sisters
came
together
in
their
own
room
,
he
appeared
at
the
chamber
door
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
marvellous
contrast
<EOS>
it
was
---
they
so
heated
,
noisy
,
and
vehement
;
<EOS>
he
so
calm
,
so
self
-
possessed
,
so
cool
and
full
of
peace
,
that
not
a
hair
upon
his
head
was
stirred
.
   
<EOS>
"
Children
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
spreading
out
his
hands
in
wonder
,
but
not
before
he
had
shut
the
door
,
and
set
his
back
against
it
.
"
<EOS>
Girls
!
 
<EOS>
Daughters
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
wretch
;
the
apostate
;
the
false
,
mean
,
odious
villain
;
has
before
my
very
face
proposed
to
Mercy
!
<EOS>
"
was
his
eldest
daughter
's
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
has
proposed
to
Mercy
!
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
HE
has
.
 
<EOS>
That
thing
,
Jonas
,
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jonas
proposed
to
Mercy
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
Have
you
nothing
else
to
say
?
"
cried
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
be
driven
mad
,
papa
?
 
<EOS>
He
has
proposed
to
Mercy
,
not
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
fie
!
 
<EOS>
For
shame
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
for
shame
!
<EOS>
Can
the
triumph
of
a
sister
move
you
to
this
terrible
display
,
my
child
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
really
this
is
very
sad
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
;
I
am
surprised
and
hurt
to
see
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
Mercy
,
my
girl
,
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
See
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
envy
,
envy
,
what
a
passion
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
Uttering
this
apostrophe
in
a
tone
full
of
grief
and
lamentation
,
Mr
Pecksniff
left
the
room
(
taking
care
to
shut
the
door
behind
him
)
,
and
walked
downstairs
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
found
his
intended
son
-
in
-
law
,
whom
he
seized
by
both
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jonas
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jonas
!
<EOS>
the
dearest
wish
of
my
heart
is
now
fulfilled
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
;
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
'll
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
!
<EOS>
As
it
ai
n't
the
one
you
're
so
fond
of
,
you
must
come
down
with
another
thousand
,
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
make
it
up
five
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
worth
that
,
to
keep
your
treasure
to
yourself
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
get
off
very
cheap
that
way
,
and
have
n't
a
sacrifice
to
make
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
grin
with
which
he
accompanied
this
,
set
off
his
other
attractions
to
such
unspeakable
advantage
,
that
even
Mr
Pecksniff
lost
his
presence
of
mind
for
a
moment
,
and
looked
at
the
young
man
as
if
he
were
quite
stupefied
with
wonder
and
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
quickly
regained
his
composure
,
and
was
in
the
very
act
of
changing
the
subject
,
when
a
hasty
step
was
heard
without
,
and
Tom
Pinch
,
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
,
came
darting
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
On
seeing
a
stranger
there
,
apparently
engaged
with
Mr
Pecksniff
in
private
conversation
,
Tom
was
very
much
abashed
,
though
he
still
looked
as
if
he
had
something
of
great
importance
to
communicate
,
which
would
be
a
sufficient
apology
for
his
intrusion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
"
this
is
hardly
decent
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
my
saying
that
I
think
your
conduct
scarcely
decent
,
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
replied
Tom
,
"
for
not
knocking
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rather
beg
this
gentleman
's
pardon
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
;
he
does
not
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
My
young
man
,
Mr
Jonas
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
son
-
in
-
law
that
was
to
be
gave
him
a
slight
nod
---
not
actively
disdainful
or
contemptuous
,
only
passively
;
for
he
was
in
a
good
humour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Could
I
speak
a
word
with
you
,
sir
,
if
you
please
?
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
rather
pressing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
should
be
very
pressing
to
justify
this
strange
behaviour
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
returned
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
for
one
moment
,
my
dear
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
what
is
the
reason
of
this
rough
intrusion
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Tom
,
standing
,
cap
in
hand
,
before
his
patron
in
the
passage
;
"
and
I
know
it
must
have
a
very
rude
appearance
---
"
   
"
It
HAS
a
very
rude
appearance
,
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
feel
that
,
sir
;
but
the
truth
is
,
I
was
so
surprised
to
see
them
,
and
knew
you
would
be
too
,
<EOS>
that
I
ran
home
very
fast
indeed
,
and
really
had
n't
enough
command
over
myself
to
know
what
I
was
doing
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
church
just
now
,
sir
,
touching
the
organ
for
my
own
amusement
,
when
I
happened
to
look
round
,
and
saw
a
gentleman
and
lady
standing
in
the
aisle
listening
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
be
strangers
,
sir
,
as
well
as
I
could
make
out
in
the
dusk
;
and
I
thought
I
did
n't
know
them
;
so
presently
I
left
off
,
and
said
,
would
they
walk
up
into
the
organ
-
loft
,
or
take
a
seat
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
they
said
,
they
would
n't
do
that
;
but
they
thanked
me
for
the
music
they
had
heard
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
"
observed
Tom
,
blushing
,
"
they
said
,
"
Delicious
music
!
"
<EOS>
at
least
,
SHE
did
;
and
I
am
sure
that
was
a
greater
pleasure
and
honour
to
me
than
any
compliment
I
could
have
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
---
beg
your
pardon
sir
;
"
he
was
all
in
a
tremble
,
and
dropped
his
hat
for
the
second
time
"
<EOS>
but
I
---
<EOS>
I
'm
rather
flurried
,
and
I
fear
I
've
wandered
from
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
come
back
to
it
,
Thomas
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
an
icy
look
,
"
I
shall
feel
obliged
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Tom
,
"
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
posting
carriage
at
the
porch
,
sir
,
and
had
stopped
to
hear
the
organ
,
they
said
.
<EOS>
And
then
they
said
---
<EOS>
SHE
said
,
I
mean
,
"
I
believe
you
live
with
Mr
Pecksniff
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
had
that
honour
,
and
I
took
the
liberty
,
sir
,
"
<EOS>
added
Tom
,
raising
his
eyes
to
his
benefactor
's
face
,
"
of
saying
,
as
I
always
will
and
must
,
with
your
permission
,
that
I
was
under
great
obligations
to
you
,
and
never
could
express
my
sense
of
them
sufficiently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
was
very
,
very
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Take
your
time
,
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
that
they
asked
me
---
she
asked
,
I
mean
---
"
Was
n't
there
a
bridle
road
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
?
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
suddenly
became
full
of
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
Without
going
by
the
Dragon
?
"
 
<EOS>
When
I
said
there
was
,
and
said
how
happy
I
should
be
to
show
it
'em
<EOS>
,
they
sent
the
carriage
on
by
the
road
,
and
came
with
me
across
the
meadows
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
'em
at
the
turnstile
to
run
forward
and
tell
you
they
were
coming
,
and
they
'll
be
here
,
sir
,
in
---
in
less
than
a
minute
's
time
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
,
"
added
Tom
,
fetching
his
breath
with
difficulty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
who
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
pondering
,
"
who
may
these
people
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
"
I
meant
to
mention
that
at
first
,
I
thought
I
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
them
---
<EOS>
her
,
I
mean
---
directly
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
who
was
ill
at
the
Dragon
,
sir
,
last
winter
;
and
the
young
lady
who
attended
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
,
and
he
positively
staggered
with
amazement
,
at
witnessing
the
extraordinary
effect
produced
on
Mr
Pecksniff
by
these
simple
words
.
 
<EOS>
The
dread
of
losing
the
old
man
's
favour
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
reconciled
,
through
the
mere
fact
of
having
Jonas
in
the
house
;
the
impossibility
of
dismissing
Jonas
,
or
shutting
him
up
,
or
tying
him
hand
and
foot
and
putting
him
in
the
coal
-
cellar
,
without
offending
him
beyond
recall
;
the
horrible
discordance
prevailing
in
the
establishment
,
and
the
impossibility
of
reducing
it
to
decent
harmony
with
Charity
in
loud
hysterics
,
Mercy
in
the
utmost
disorder
,
Jonas
in
the
parlour
,
and
Martin
Chuzzlewit
and
his
young
charge
upon
the
very
doorsteps
;
the
total
hopelessness
of
being
able
to
disguise
or
feasibly
explain
this
state
of
rampant
confusion
;
the
sudden
accumulation
over
his
devoted
head
of
every
complicated
perplexity
and
entanglement
for
his
extrication
from
which
he
had
trusted
to
time
,
good
fortune
,
chance
,
and
his
own
plotting
,
so
filled
the
entrapped
architect
with
dismay
,
that
if
Tom
could
have
been
a
Gorgon
staring
at
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
could
have
been
a
Gorgon
staring
at
Tom
,
they
could
not
have
horrified
each
other
half
so
much
as
in
their
own
bewildered
persons
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
"
what
have
I
done
?
 
<EOS>
I
hoped
it
would
be
a
pleasant
surprise
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
would
like
to
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
at
that
moment
a
loud
knocking
was
heard
at
the
hall
door
.

It
may
be
well
to
begin
the

with
this
frank
admission
,
lest
the
reader
should
imagine
that
the
sounds
now
deafening
this
history
's
ears
have
any
connection
with
the
knocker
on
Mr

,
or
with
the
great
amount
of
agitation
pretty
equally
divided
between
that
worthy
man

of
which
its
strong
performance

this
happy

Liberty

for
its
high
companions

Again
it
breathes
the
blessed
air
of
Independence
;
again
it
contemplates
with
pious
awe
that
moral
sense
which
renders
unto
Ceasar
nothing

again
inhales
that
sacred
atmosphere
which
was
the
life
of
him

oh
noble
patriot

many
followers

who
dreamed

were
lashed
and
tortured
like
a
living
labourer
,
and
writhed
in
agony
.
 
<EOS>
A
poor
fancy
;
for
steel
and
iron
are
of
infinitely
greater
account
,
in
this
commonwealth
,
than
flesh
and
blood
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
cunning
work
of
man
be
urged
beyond
its
power
of
endurance
,
it
has
within
it
the
elements
of
its
own
revenge
;
whereas
the
wretched
mechanism
of
the
Divine
Hand
is
dangerous
with
no
such
property
,
but
may
be
tampered
with
,
and
crushed
,
and
broken
,
at
the
driver
's
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
that
engine
!
 
<EOS>
It
shall
cost
a
man
more
dollars
in
the
way
of
penalty
and
fine
,
and
satisfaction
of
the
outraged
law
,
to
deface
in
wantonness
that
senseless
mass
of
metal
,
than
to
take
the
lives
of
twenty
human
creatures
!
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
stars
wink
upon
the
bloody
stripes
;
and
Liberty
pulls
down
her
cap
upon
her
eyes
,
and
owns
Oppression
in
its
vilest
aspect
,
for
her
sister
.
   
<EOS>
The
engine
-
driver
of
the
train
whose
noise
awoke
us
to
the
present
chapter
was
certainly
troubled
with
no
such
reflections
as
these
;
nor
is
it
very
probable
that
his
mind
was
disturbed
by
any
reflections
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
leaned
with
folded
arms
and
crossed
legs
against
the
side
of
the
carriage
,
smoking
;
and
,
except
when
he
expressed
,
by
a
grunt
as
short
as
his
pipe
,
his
approval
of
some
particularly
dexterous
aim
on
the
part
of
his
colleague
,
the
fireman
,
who
beguiled
his
leisure
by
throwing
logs
of
wood
from
the
tender
at
the
numerous
stray
cattle
on
the
line
,
he
preserved
a
composure
so
immovable
,
and
an
indifference
so
complete
,
that
if
the
locomotive
had
been
a
sucking
-
pig
,
he
could
not
have
been
more
perfectly
indifferent
to
its
doings
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
tranquil
state
of
this
officer
,
and
his
unbroken
peace
of
mind
,
the
train
was
proceeding
with
tolerable
rapidity
;
and
the
rails
being
but
poorly
laid
,
the
jolts
and
bumps
it
met
with
in
its
progress
were
neither
slight
nor
few
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
three
great
caravans
or
cars
attached
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
'
car
,
the
gentlemen
's
car
,
and
the
car
for
negroes
;
the
latter
painted
black
,
as
an
appropriate
compliment
to
its
company
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
and
Mark
Tapley
were
in
the
first
,
as
it
was
the
most
comfortable
;
and
,
being
far
from
full
,
received
other
gentlemen
who
,
like
them
,
were
unblessed
by
the
society
of
ladies
of
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
seated
side
by
side
,
and
were
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
Mark
,
"
said
Martin
,
looking
at
him
with
an
anxious
expression
,
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
are
glad
we
have
left
New
York
far
behind
us
,
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
Precious
glad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Were
you
not
"
jolly
"
there
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrairy
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
jolliest
week
as
ever
I
spent
in
my
life
,
was
that
there
week
at
Pawkins
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
our
prospects
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Martin
,
with
an
air
that
plainly
said
he
had
avoided
the
question
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Uncommon
bright
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
for
a
place
to
have
a
better
name
,
sir
,
than
the
Walley
of
Eden
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
could
n't
think
of
settling
in
a
better
place
than
the
Walley
of
Eden
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'm
told
,
"
added
Mark
,
after
a
pause
,
"
as
there
's
lots
of
serpents
there
,
so
we
shall
come
out
,
quite
complete
and
reg'lar
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
far
from
dwelling
upon
this
agreeable
piece
of
information
with
the
least
dismay
,
Mark
's
face
grew
radiant
as
he
called
it
to
mind
;
<EOS>
so
very
radiant
,
that
a
stranger
might
have
supposed
he
had
all
his
life
been
yearning
for
the
society
of
serpents
,
and
now
hailed
with
delight
the
approaching
consummation
of
his
fondest
wishes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
told
you
that
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Martin
,
sternly
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
military
officer
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Confound
you
for
a
ridiculous
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
laughing
heartily
in
spite
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
military
officer
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
they
spring
up
in
every
field
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
thick
as
scarecrows
in
England
,
sir
,
"
interposed
Mark
,
"
which
is
a
sort
of
milita
themselves
,
being
entirely
coat
and
wescoat
,
with
a
stick
inside
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
---
Do
n't
mind
me
,
sir
;
it
's
my
way
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
being
jolly
.
 
<EOS>
Why
it
was
one
of
them
inwading
conquerors
at
Pawkins
's
,
as
told
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
rightly
informed
,
"
he
says
---
not
exactly
through
his
nose
,
but
as
if
he
'd
got
a
stoppage
in
it
,
very
high
up
---
"
that
you
're
a
-
going
to
the
Walley
of
Eden
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
heard
some
talk
on
it
,
"
I
told
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
says
he
,
"
if
you
should
ever
happen
to
go
to
bed
there
---
you
MAY
,
you
know
,
"
he
says
,
"
in
course
of
time
as
civilisation
progresses
---
do
n't
forget
to
take
a
axe
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
looks
at
him
tolerable
hard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fleas
?
"
says
I.
 
"
And
more
,
"
says
he
.
<EOS>
"
Wampires
?
<EOS>
"
says
I.
 
"
And
more
,
"
says
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Musquitoes
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
says
I.
 
"
And
more
,
"
says
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
more
?
"
says
I.
 
"
Snakes
more
,
"
says
he
;
"
rattle
-
snakes
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
right
to
a
certain
extent
,
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
There
air
some
catawampous
chawers
in
the
small
way
too
,
as
graze
upon
a
human
pretty
strong
;
but
do
n't
mind
THEM
<EOS>
---
they
're
company
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
snakes
,
"
he
says
,
"
as
you
'll
object
to
;
and
<EOS>
whenever
you
wake
and
see
one
in
a
upright
poster
on
your
bed
,
"
he
says
,
"
like
a
corkscrew
with
the
handle
off
a
-
sittin
'
on
its
bottom
ring
,
cut
him
down
,
for
he
means
wenom
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
this
before
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
with
an
expression
of
face
which
set
off
the
cheerfulness
of
Mark
's
visage
to
great
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
on
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
come
in
at
one
ear
,
and
went
out
at
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
But
Lord
love
us
<EOS>
,
he
was
one
of
another
Company
,
I
dare
say
,
and
only
made
up
the
story
that
we
might
go
to
his
Eden
,
and
not
the
opposition
one
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
some
probability
in
that
,
"
observed
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
hope
so
,
with
all
my
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
not
a
doubt
about
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
,
<EOS>
who
,
full
of
the
inspiriting
influence
of
the
anecodote
upon
himself
,
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
its
probable
effect
upon
his
master
;
"
anyhow
,
we
must
live
,
you
know
,
sir
.
"
   
"
Live
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
easy
to
say
live
;
but
if
we
should
happen
not
to
wake
when
rattlesnakes
are
making
corkscrews
of
themselves
upon
our
beds
,
it
may
be
not
so
easy
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
a
fact
,
"
said
a
voice
so
close
in
his
ear
that
it
tickled
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
dreadful
true
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
looked
round
,
and
found
that
a
gentleman
,
on
the
seat
behind
,
had
thrust
his
head
between
himself
and
Mark
,
and
sat
with
his
chin
resting
on
the
back
rail
of
their
little
bench
,
entertaining
himself
with
their
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
languid
and
listless
in
his
looks
as
most
of
the
gentlemen
they
had
seen
;
his
cheeks
were
so
hollow
that
he
seemed
to
be
always
sucking
them
in
;
and
the
sun
had
burnt
him
,
not
a
wholesome
red
or
brown
,
but
dirty
yellow
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
bright
dark
eyes
,
which
he
kept
half
closed
;
<EOS>
only
peeping
out
of
the
corners
,
and
even
then
with
a
glance
that
seemed
to
say
,
"
Now
you
wo
n't
overreach
me
;
you
want
to
,
but
you
wo
n't
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
arms
rested
carelessly
on
his
knees
as
he
leant
forward
;
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
,
as
English
rustics
have
their
slice
of
cheese
,
he
had
a
cake
of
tobacco
;
in
his
right
a
penknife
.
 
<EOS>
He
struck
into
the
dialogue
with
as
little
reserve
as
if
he
had
been
specially
called
in
,
days
before
,
to
hear
the
arguments
on
both
sides
,
and
favour
them
with
his
opinion
;
and
he
no
more
contemplated
or
cared
for
the
possibility
of
their
not
desiring
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
or
interference
in
their
private
affairs
than
if
he
had
been
a
bear
or
a
buffalo
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
he
repeated
,
nodding
condescendingly
to
Martin
,
as
to
an
outer
barbarian
and
foreigner
,
"
is
dreadful
true
.
 
<EOS>
Darn
all
manner
of
vermin
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
could
not
help
frowning
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
were
disposed
to
insinuate
that
the
gentleman
had
unconsciously
"
darned
"
himself
.
<EOS>
But
remembering
the
wisdom
of
doing
at
Rome
as
Romans
do
,
he
smiled
with
the
pleasantest
expression
he
could
assume
upon
so
short
a
notice
.
   
<EOS>
Their
new
friend
said
no
more
just
then
,
being
busily
employed
in
cutting
a
quid
or
plug
from
his
cake
of
tobacco
,
and
whistling
softly
to
himself
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
shaped
it
to
his
liking
,
he
took
out
his
old
plug
,
and
deposited
the
same
on
the
back
of
the
seat
between
Mark
and
Martin
,
while
he
thrust
the
new
one
into
the
hollow
of
his
cheek
,
where
it
looked
like
a
large
walnut
,
or
tolerable
pippin
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
it
quite
satisfactory
,
he
stuck
the
point
of
his
knife
into
the
old
plug
,
and
holding
it
out
for
their
inspection
,
remarked
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
not
lived
in
vain
,
that
it
was
"
used
up
considerable
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
tossed
it
away
;
put
his
knife
into
one
pocket
and
his
tobacco
into
another
;
rested
his
chin
upon
the
rail
as
before
;
and
approving
of
the
pattern
on
Martin
's
waistcoat
,
reached
out
his
hand
to
feel
the
texture
of
that
garment
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
this
now
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
"
said
Martin
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
it
's
called
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
cost
a
dollar
or
more
a
yard
,
I
reckon
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
my
country
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
we
know
the
cost
of
our
own
pro
-
duce
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
not
discussing
the
question
,
there
was
a
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
resumed
their
new
friend
,
after
staring
at
them
intently
during
the
whole
interval
of
silence
;
"
how
's
the
unnat'ral
old
parent
by
this
time
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
regarding
this
inquiry
as
only
another
version
of
the
impertinent
English
question
,
<EOS>
"
How
's
your
mother
?
"
would
have
resented
it
instantly
,
but
for
Martin
's
prompt
interposition
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
the
old
country
?
"
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
's
she
?
 
<EOS>
Progressing
back'ards
,
I
expect
,
as
usual
?
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
How
's
Queen
Victoria
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
good
health
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Queen
Victoria
wo
n't
shake
in
her
royal
shoes
at
all
,
when
she
hears
to
-
morrow
named
,
"
observed
the
stranger
,
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
am
aware
of
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
wo
n't
be
taken
with
a
cold
chill
,
when
she
realises
what
is
being
done
in
these
diggings
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
take
my
oath
of
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
strange
gentleman
looked
at
him
as
if
in
pity
for
his
ignorance
or
prejudice
,
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
tell
you
this
---
there
ai
n't
a
engine
with
its
biler
bust

in

A'mighty

so
fixed

"
   
<EOS>
Several
other
gentlemen
had
left
their
seats
and
gathered
round
during
the
foregoing
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
highly
delighted
with
this
speech
.
 
<EOS>
One
very
lank
gentleman
,
in
a
loose
limp
white
cravat
,
long
white
waistcoat
,
and
a
black
great
-
coat
,
who
seemed
to
be
in
authority
among
them
,
felt
called
upon
to
acknowledge
it
.
   
<EOS>

Mr

he
said
,
taking
off
his
hat
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
grave
murmur
of
"
Hush

"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
La
Fayette
Kettle
!
 
<EOS>
Sir

"
   
<EOS>
Mr

bowed

<EOS>
"
In

our
common

for
your

<EOS>
And
if

,
"
said
the
speaker
,
<EOS>
poking
Martin
with
the
handle
of
his
umbrella
to
bespeak
his
attention
,
for
he
was
listening
to
a
whisper
from
Mark
;
"
if
,
sir
,
in
such
a
place
,
and
at
such
a
time
,
I
might
venture
to
con
-
clude
with
a
sentiment
,
glancing
---
however
slantin'dicularly
---
at
the
subject
in
hand
,
I
would
say
,
sir
,
may
the
British
Lion
have
his
talons
eradicated
by
the
noble
bill
of
the
American
Eagle
,
and
be
taught
to
play
upon
the
Irish
Harp
and
the
Scotch
Fiddle
that
music
which
is
breathed
in
every
empty
shell
that
lies
upon
the
shores
of
green
Co

lumbia
!
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
lank
gentleman
sat
down
again
,
amidst
a
great
sensation
;
and
every
one
looked
very
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
General
Choke
,
"
said
Mr
La
Fayette
Kettle
,
"
you
warm
my
heart
;
sir
,
you
warm
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
British
Lion
is
not
unrepresented
here
,
sir
;
and
I
should
be
glad
to
hear
his
answer
to
those
remarks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
cried
Martin
,
laughing
,
"
since
you
do
me
the
honour
to
consider
me
his
representative
,
I
have
only
to
say
that
I
never
heard
of
Queen
Victoria
reading
the
What's
-
his
-
name
Gazette
and
that
I
should
scarcely
think
it
probable
.
"
   
<EOS>
General
Choke
smiled
upon
the
rest
,
and
said
,
in
patient
and
benignant
explanation
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
sent
to
her
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
sent
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mail
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
is
addressed
to
the
Tower
of
London
,
it
would
hardly
come
to
hand
,
I
fear
,
"
returned
Martin
;
"
for
she
do
n't
live
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Queen
of
England
,
gentlemen
,
"
observed
Mr
Tapley
,
affecting
the
greatest
politeness
,
and
regarding
them
with
an
immovable
face
,
"
usually
lives
in
the
Mint
to
take
care
of
the
money

<EOS>
She
HAS
lodgings
,
in
virtue
of
her
office
,
with
the
Lord
Mayor
at
the
Mansion
House
;
but
do
n't
often
occupy
them
,
in
consequence
of
the
parlour
chimney
smoking
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
I
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
'll
have
the
goodness
not
to
interfere
with
preposterous
statements

,
however
jocose
they
may
appear
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
merely
remarking
gentlemen
---
though
it
's
a
point
of
very
little
import
---
that
the
Queen
of
England
does
not
happen
to
live
in
the
Tower
of
London
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
General
!
"
cried
Mr
La
Fayette
Kettle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
?
"
   
"
General
!
"
echoed
several
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
General
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
silence
!
"
said
General
Choke
,
holding
up
his
hand
,
and
speaking
with
a
patient
and
complacent
benevolence
that
was
quite
touching
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
remarked
it
as
a
very
extraordinary
circumstance
,
which
I
impute
to
the
natur
"
of
British
Institutions
and
their
tendency
to
suppress
that
popular
inquiry
and
information
which
air
so
widely
diffused
even
in
the
trackless
forests
of
this
vast
Continent
of
the
Western
Ocean
;
that
the
knowledge
of
Britishers
themselves
on
such
points
is
not
to
be
compared
with
that
possessed
by
our
intelligent
and
locomotive
citizens
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
interesting
,
and
confirms
my
observation
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
say
,
sir
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
Martin
,
"
that
your
Queen
does
not
reside
in
the
Tower
of
London
,
you
fall
into
an
error
,
not
uncommon
to
your
countrymen
,
even
when
their
abilities
and
moral
elements
air
such
as
to
command
respect
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
you
air
wrong

<EOS>
She
DOES
live
there
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
she
is
at
the
Court
of
Saint
James

"
interposed
Kettle
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
she
is
at
the
Court
of
Saint
James
's
,
of
course
,
"
returned
the
General
,
in
the
same
benignant
way
;
"
for
if
her
location
was
in
Windsor
Pavilion
it
could
n't
be
in
London
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Tower
of
London

sir
,
"
pursued
the
General
,
smiling
with
a
mild
consciousness
of
his
knowledge
,
"
is
nat'rally
your
royal
residence
.
<EOS>
Being
located
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
your
Parks
,
your
Drives
,
your
Triumphant
Arches
,
your
Opera
,
and
your
Royal
Almacks
,
it
nat'rally
suggests
itself
as
the
place
for
holding
a
luxurious
and
thoughtless
court
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
consequently
,
"
said
the
General
,
"
consequently
,
the
court
is
held
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
in
England
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
print
I
have
,
sir
,
"
said
the
General
,
"
not
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
We
air
a
reading
people
here
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
meet
with
much
information
among
us
that
will
surprise
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
,
"
returned
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
he
was
interrupted
by
Mr
La
Fayette
Kettle
,
who
whispered
in
his
ear
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
General
Choke
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
Martin
,
in
the
same
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
he
is
considered
?
"
   
"
One
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
the
country
?
"
said
Martin
,
at
a
venture
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
fact
,
"
rejoined
Kettle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
sure
you
must
have
heard
of
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Martin
,
addressing
himself
to
the
General
again
,
"
that
I
have
the
pleasure
of
being
the
bearer
of
a
letter
of
introduction
to
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
From
Mr
Bevan
,
of
Massachusetts
,
"
he
added
,
giving
it
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
General
took
it
and
read
it
attentively
;
now
and
then
stopping
to
glance
at
the
two
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
finished
the
note
,
he
came
over
to
Martin
,
sat
down
by
him
,
and
shook
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
and
you
think
of
settling
in
Eden
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Subject
to
your
opinion
,
and
the
agent
's
advice
,
"
replied
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
told
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
in
the
old
towns
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
introduce
you
to
the
agent
,
sir
,
"
said
the
General
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
am
a
member
of
the
Eden
Land
Corporation
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
serious
news
to
Martin
,
for
his
friend
had
laid
great
stress
upon
the
General
's
having
no
connection
,
as
he
thought
,
with
any
land
company
,
and
therefore
being
likely
to
give
him
disinterested
advice
.
 
<EOS>
The
General
explained
that
he
had
joined
the
Corporation
only
a
few
weeks
ago
,
and
that
no
communication
had
passed
between
himself
and
Mr
Bevan
since
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
very
little
to
venture
,
"
said
Martin
anxiously
---
"
only
a
few
pounds
---
but
it
is
our
all
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
do
you
think
that
for
one
of
my
profession
,
this
would
be
a
speculation
with
any
hope
or
chance
in
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
observed
the
General
,
gravely
,
"
if
there
was
n't
any
hope
or
chance
in
the
speculation
,
it
would
n't
have
engaged
my
dollars
,
I
opinionate
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
for
the
sellers
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
buyers
---
for
the
buyers
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
buyers
,
sir
?
"
observed
the
General
,
in
a
most
impressive
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
you
come
from
an
old
country
;
from
a
country
,
sir
,
that
has
piled
up
golden
calves
as
high
as
Babel
,
and
worshipped
'em
for
ages
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
a
new
country
,
sir
;
man
is
in
a
more
primeval
state
here
,
sir
;
we
have
not
the
excuse
of
having
lapsed
in
the
slow
course
of
time
into
degenerate
practices
;
we
have
no
false
gods
;
man
,
sir
,
here
,
is
man
in
all
his
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
We
fought
for
that
or
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Here
am
I
,
sir
,
"
said
the
General
,
setting
up
his
umbrella
to
represent
himself
,
and
a
villanous
-
looking
umbrella
it
was
;
a
very
bad
counter
to
stand
for
the
sterling
coin
of
his
benevolence
,
"
here
am
I
with
grey
hairs
sir
,
and
a
moral
sense
.
<EOS>
Would
I
,
with
my
principles
,
invest
capital
in
this
speculation
if
I
did
n't
think
it
full
of
hopes
and
chances
for
my
brother
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
tried
to
look
convinced
,
but
he
thought
of
New
York
,
and
found
it
difficult
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
the
Great
United
States
for
,
sir
,
"
pursued
the
General
"
if
not
for
the
regeneration
of
man
?
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
nat'ral
in
you
to
make
such
an
enquerry
,
for
you
come
from
England
,
and
you
do
not
know
my
country
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
think
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
that
allowing
for
the
hardships
we
are
prepared
to
undergo
,
there
is
a
reasonable
---
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
we
do
n't
expect
much
---
a
reasonable
opening
in
this
place
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
reasonable
opening
in
Eden
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
But
see
the
agent
,
see
the
agent
;
see
the
maps
and
plans
,
sir
;
and
conclude
to
go
or
stay
,
according
to
the
natur
"
of
the
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
Eden
had
n't
need
to
go
a
-
begging
yet
,
sir
,
"
remarked
the
General
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
awful
lovely
place
,
sure
-
ly
.
 
<EOS>
And
frightful
wholesome
,
likewise
!
"
said
Mr
Kettle
,
who
had
made
himself
a
party
to
this
conversation
as
a
matter
of
course
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
felt
that
to
dispute
such
testimony
,
for
no
better
reason
than
because
he
had
his
secret
misgivings
on
the
subject
,
would
be
ungentlemanly
and
indecent
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
thanked
the
General
for
his
promise
to
put
him
in
personal
communication
with
the
agent
;
and
"
concluded
"
to
see
that
officer
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
begged
the
General
to
inform
him
who
the
Watertoast
Sympathisers
were
,
of
whom
he
had
spoken
in
addressing
Mr
La
Fayette
Kettle
,
and
on
what
grievances
they
bestowed
their
Sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
the
General
,
looking
very
serious
,
made
answer
,
that
he
might
fully
enlighten
himself
on
those
points
to
-
morrow
by
attending
a
Great
Meeting
of
the
Body
,
which
would
then
be
held
at
the
town
to
which
they
were
travelling
;
"
over
which
,
sir
,
"
said
the
General
,
"
my
fellow
-
citizens
have
called
on
me
to
preside
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
came
to
their
journey
's
end
late
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Close
to
the
railway
was
an
immense
white
edifice
,
like
an
ugly
hospital
,
on
which
was
painted
"
NATIONAL
HOTEL
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
wooden
gallery
or
verandah
in
front
,
in
which
it
was
rather
startling
,
when
the
train
stopped
,
to
behold
a
great
many
pairs
of
boots
and
shoes
,
and
the
smoke
of
a
great
many
cigars
,
but
no
other
evidences
of
human
habitation
.
 
<EOS>
By
slow
degrees
,
however
,
some
heads
and
shoulders
appeared
,
and
connecting
themselves
with
the
boots
and
shoes
,
led
to
the
discovery
that
certain
gentlemen
boarders
,
who
had
a
fancy
for
putting
their
heels
where
the
gentlemen
boarders
in
other
countries
usually
put
their
heads
,
were
enjoying
themselves
after
their
own
manner
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
bar
-
room
in
this
hotel
,
and
a
great
public
room
in
which
the
general
table
was
being
set
out
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
interminable
whitewashed
staircases
,
long
whitewashed
galleries
upstairs
and
downstairs
,
scores
of
little
whitewashed
bedrooms
,
and
a
four
-
sided
verandah
to
every
story
in
the
house
,
which
formed
a
large
brick
square
with
an
uncomfortable
courtyard
in
the
centre
,
where
some
clothes
were
drying
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
some
yawning
gentlemen
lounged
up
and
down
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
;
but
within
the
house
and
without
,
wherever
half
a
dozen
people
were
collected
together
,
there
,
in
their
looks
,
dress
,
morals
,
manners
,
habits
,
intellect
,
and
conversation
,
were
Mr
Jefferson
Brick
,
Colonel
Diver
,
Major
Pawkins
,
General
Choke
,
and
Mr
La
Fayette
Kettle
,
over
,
and
over
,
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
did
the
same
things
;
said
the
same
things
;
judged
all
subjects
by
,
and
reduced
all
subjects
to
,
the
same
standard
.
 
<EOS>
Observing
how
they
lived
,
and
how
they
were
always
in
the
enchanting
company
of
each
other
,
Martin
even
began
to
comprehend
their
being
the
social
,
cheerful
,
winning
,
airy
men
they
were
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
sounding
of
a
dismal
gong
,
this
pleasant
company
went
trooping
down
from
all
parts
of
the
house
to
the
public
room
;
while
from
the
neighbouring
stores
other
guests
came
flocking
in
,
in
shoals
;
for
half
the
town
,
married
folks
as
well
as
single
,
resided
at
the
National
Hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
,
coffee
,
dried
meats
,
tongue
,
ham
,
pickles
,
cake
,
toast
,
preserves
,
and
bread
and
butter
,
were
swallowed
with
the
usual
ravaging
speed
;
and
then
,
as
before
,
the
company
dropped
off
by
degrees
,
and
lounged
away
to
the
desk
,
the
counter
,
or
the
bar
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
had
a
smaller
ordinary
of
their
own
,
to
which
their
husbands
and
brothers
were
admitted
if
they
chose
;
and
in
all
other
respects
they
enjoyed
themselves
as
at
Pawkins

<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mark
,
my
good
fellow
,
said
Martin
,
closing
the
door
of
his
little
chamber
,
"
we
must
hold
a
solemn
council
,
for
our
fate
is
decided
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
determined
to
invest
these
savings
of
yours
in
the
common
stock
,
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
n't
been
determined
to
make
that
wentur
,
sir
,
"
answered
Mr
Tapley
,
"
I
should
n't
have
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
much
is
there
here
,
did
you
say
"
asked
Martin
,
holding
up
a
little
bag
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thirty
-
seven
pound
ten
and
sixpence
.
 
<EOS>
The
Savings
'
Bank
said
so
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
counted
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
THEY
know
,
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mark
,
with
a
shake
of
the
head
expressive
of
his
unbounded
confidence
in
the
wisdom
and
arithmetic
of
those
Institutions
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
money
we
brought
with
us
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
is
reduced
to
a
few
shillings
less
than
eight
pounds
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
smiled
,
and
looked
all
manner
of
ways
,
that
he
might
not
be
supposed
to
attach
any
importance
to
this
fact
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
the
ring
---
HER
ring
,
Mark
,
"
said
Martin
,
looking
ruefully
at
his
empty
finger
---
    
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
sighed
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
"
   
"
---
We
raised
,
in
English
money
,
fourteen
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
even
with
that
,
your
share
of
the
stock
is
still
very
much
the
larger
of
the
two
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Mark
,
"
said
Martin
,
in
his
old
way
,
just
as
he
might
have
spoken
to
Tom
Pinch
,
"
I
have
thought
of
a
means
of
making
this
up
to
you
---
more
than
making
it
up
to
you
,
I
hope
---
and
very
materially
elevating
your
prospects
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
n't
talk
of
that
,
you
know
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
no
elevating
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
all
right
enough
,
sir
,
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
but
hear
me
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
because
this
is
very
important
to
you
,
and
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
,
you
shall
be
a
partner
in
the
business
;
an
equal
partner
with
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
put
in
,
as
my
additional
capital
,
my
professional
knowledge
and
ability
;
and
half
the
annual
profits
,
as
long
as
it
is
carried
on
,
shall
be
yours
.
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Martin
!
 
<EOS>
For
ever
building
castles
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
For
ever
,
in
his
very
selfishness
,
forgetful
of
all
but
his
own
teeming
hopes
and
sanguine
plans
.
 
<EOS>
Swelling
,
at
that
instant
,
with
the
consciousness
of
patronizing
and
most
munificently
rewarding
Mark
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
Mark
rejoined
,
much
more
sadly
than
his
custom
was
,
though
from
a
very
different
cause
than
Martin
supposed
,
"
what
I
can
say
to
this
,
in
the
way
of
thanking
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
stand
by
you
,
sir
,
to
the
best
of
my
ability
,
and
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
quite
understand
each
other
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
said
Martin
rising
in
self
-
approval
and
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
no
longer
master
and
servant
,
but
friends
and
partners
;
and
are
mutually
gratified
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
determine
on
Eden
,
the
business
shall
be
commenced
as
soon
as
we
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
name
,
"
said
Martin
,
who
never
hammered
upon
an
idea
that
was
n't
red
hot
,
"
under
the
name
of
Chuzzlewit
and
Tapley
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Lord
love
you
,
sir
,
"
cried
Mark
,
"
do
n't
have
my
name
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
acquainted
with
the
business
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
Co.
<EOS>
,
I
must
.
<EOS>
I
've
often
thought
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
as
I
should
like
to
know
a
Co.
;
but
I
little
thought
as
ever
I
should
live
to
be
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
your
own
way
,
Mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
country
gentleman
thereabouts
,
in
the
public
way
,
or
otherwise
,
wanted
such
a
thing
as
a
skittle
-
ground
made
,
I
could
take
that
part
of
the
bis'ness
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Against
any
architect
in
the
States
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
a
couple
of
sherry
-
cobblers
,
Mark
,
and
we
'll
drink
success
to
the
firm
.
"
   
<EOS>
Either
he
forgot
already
(
and
often
afterwards
)
,
that
they
were
no
longer
master
and
servant
,
or
considered
this
kind
of
duty
to
be
among
the
legitimate
functions
of
the
Co.
 
<EOS>
But
Mark
obeyed
with
his
usual
alacrity
;
and
before
they
parted
for
the
night
,
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
they
should
go
together
to
the
agent
's
in
the
morning
,
but
that
Martin
should
decide
the
Eden
question
,
on
his
own
sound
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mark
made
no
merit
,
even
to
himself
in
his
jollity
,
of
this
concession
;
perfectly
well
knowing
that
the
matter
would
come
to
that
in
the
end
,
any
way
.
   
<EOS>
The
General
was
one
of
the
party
at
the
public
table
next
day
,
and
after
breakfast
suggested
that
they
should
wait
upon
the
agent
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
desiring
nothing
more
,
agreed
;
so
off
they
all
four
started
for
the
office
of
the
Eden
Settlement
,
which
was
almost
within
rifle
-
shot
of
the
National
Hotel
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
place
---
something
like
a
turnpike
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
great
deal
of
land
may
be
got
into
a
dice
-
box
,
and
why
may
not
a
whole
territory
be
bargained
for
in
a
shed
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
<EOS>
a
temporary
office
too
;
for
the
Edeners
were
"
going
"
to
build
a
superb
establishment
for
the
transaction
of
their
business
,
and
had
already
got
so
far
as
to
mark
out
the
site
.
 
<EOS>
Which
is
a
great
way
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
The
office
-
door
was
wide
open
,
and
in
the
doorway
was
the
agent
;
no
doubt
a
tremendous
fellow
to
get
through
his
work
,
for
he
seemed
to
have
no
arrears
,
but
was
swinging
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
rocking
-
chair
,
with
one
of
his
legs
planted
high
up
against
the
door
-
post
,
and
the
other
doubled
up
under
him
,
as
if
he
were
hatching
his
foot
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
gaunt
man
in
a
huge
straw
hat
,
and
a
coat
of
green
stuff
.
<EOS>
The
weather
being
hot
,
he
had
no
cravat
,
and
wore
his
shirt
collar
wide
open
;
so
that
every
time
he
spoke
something
was
seen
to
twitch
and
jerk
up
in
his
throat
,
like
the
little
hammers
in
a
harpsichord
when
the
notes
are
struck
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
the
Truth
feebly
endeavouring
to
leap
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
it
never
reached
them
.
   
<EOS>
Two
grey
eyes
lurked
deep
within
this
agent
's
head
,
but
one
of
them
had
no
sight
in
it
,
and
stood
stock
still
.
 
<EOS>
With
that
side
of
his
face
he
seemed
to
listen
to
what
the
other
side
was
doing
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
each
profile
had
a
distinct
expression
;
and
when
the
movable
side
was
most
in
action
,
the
rigid
one
was
in
its
coldest
state
of
watchfulness
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
turning
the
man
inside
out
,
to
pass
to
that
view
of
his
features
in
his
liveliest
mood
,
and
see
how
calculating
and
intent
they
were
.
   
<EOS>
Each
long
black
hair
upon
his
head
hung
down
as
straight
as
any
plummet
line
;
but
rumpled
tufts
were
on
the
arches
of
his
eyes
,
as
if
the
crow
whose
foot
was
deeply
printed
in
the
corners
had
pecked
and
torn
them
in
a
savage
recognition
of
his
kindred
nature
as
a
bird
of
prey
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
man
whom
they
now
approached
,
and
whom
the
General
saluted
by
the
name
of
Scadder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Gen'ral
,
"
he
returned
,
"
and
how
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ac
-
tive
and
spry
,
sir
,
in
my
country
's
service
and
the
sympathetic
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Two
gentlemen
on
business
,
Mr
Scadder
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
shook
hands
with
each
of
them
---
nothing
is
done
in
America
without
shaking
hands
---
then
went
on
rocking
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
what
bis'ness
you
have
brought
these
strangers
here
upon
,
then
,
Gen'ral
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
you
may
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
air
a
tongue
-
y
person
,
Gen'ral
.
 
<EOS>
For
you
talk
too
much
,
and
that
's
fact
,
"
said
Scadder
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
speak
a
-
larming
well
in
public
,
but
you
did
n't
ought
to
go
ahead
so
fast
in
private
.
 
<EOS>
Now
!
"
   
"
If
I
can
realise
your
meaning
,
ride
me
on
a
rail
!
"
returned
the
General
,
after
pausing
for
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
we
did
n't
wish
to
sell
the
lots
off
right
away
to
any
loafer
as
might
bid
,
"
said
Scadder
;
"
but
had
con
-
cluded
to
reserve
'em
for
Aristocrats
of
Natur
'
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
they
are
here
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
General
with
warmth
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
here
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
they
air
here
,
"
returned
the
agent
,
in
reproachful
accents
,
"
that
's
enough
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
did
n't
ought
to
have
your
dander
ris
with
ME
,
Gen'ral
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
General
whispered
Martin
that
Scadder
was
the
honestest
fellow
in
the
world
,
and
that
he
would
n't
have
given
him
offence
designedly
,
for
ten
thousand
dollars
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
my
duty
;
and
I
raise
the
dander
of
my
feller
critters
,
as
I
wish
to
serve
,
"
said
Scadder
in
a
low
voice
,
looking
down
the
road
and
rocking
still
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
rile
up
rough
,
along
of
my
objecting
to
their
selling
Eden
off
too
cheap
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
human
natur
'
!
 
<EOS>
Well
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Scadder
,
"
said
the
General
,
assuming
his
oratorical
deportment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
my
hand
,
and
here
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
esteem
you
,
sir
,
and
ask
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
air
friends
of
mine
,
or
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
brought
'em
here
,
sir
,
being
well
aware
,
sir
,
that
the
lots
at
present
go
entirely
too
cheap
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
air
friends
,
sir
;
these
air
partick'ler
friends
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Scadder
was
so
satisfied
by
this
explanation
,
that
he
shook
the
General
warmly
by
the
hand
,
and
got
out
of
the
rocking
-
chair
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
invited
the
General
's
particular
friends
to
accompany
him
into
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
General
,
he
observed
,
with
his
usual
benevolence
,
that
being
one
of
the
company
,
he
would
n't
interfere
in
the
transaction
on
any
account
;
so
he
appropriated
the
rocking
-
chair
to
himself
,
and
looked
at
the
prospect
,
like
a
good
Samaritan
waiting
for
a
traveller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heyday
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
as
his
eye
rested
on
a
great
plan
which
occupied
one
whole
side
of
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
office
had
little
else
in
it
,
but
some
geological
and
botanical
specimens
,
one
or
two
rusty
ledgers
,
a
homely
desk
,
and
a
stool
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heyday
!
<EOS>
what
's
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
Eden
,
"
said
Scadder
,
picking
his
teeth
with
a
sort
of
young
bayonet
that
flew
out
of
his
knife
when
he
touched
a
spring
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
had
no
idea
<EOS>
it
was
a
city
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
's
a
city
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
flourishing
city
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
An
architectural
city
!
 
<EOS>
There
were
banks
,
churches
,
cathedrals
,
market
-
places
,
factories
,
hotels
,
stores
,
mansions
,
wharves
;
an
exchange
,
a
theatre
;
public
buildings
of
all
kinds
,
down
to
the
office
of
the
Eden
Stinger
,
a
daily
journal
;
all
faithfully
depicted
in
the
view
before
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
really
a
most
important
place
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
turning
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
very
important
,
"
observed
the
agent
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Martin
,
glancing
again
at
the
Public
Buildings
,
"
that
there
's
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
it
ai
n't
all
built
,
"
replied
the
agent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
great
relief
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
market
-
place
,
now
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
built
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
That
?
"
said
the
agent
,
sticking
his
toothpick
into
the
weathercock
on
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
that
ai
n't
built
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rather
a
good
job
to
begin
with
---
eh
,
Mark
?
<EOS>
"
whispered
Martin
nudging
him
with
his
elbow
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
,
who
,
with
a
very
stolid
countenance
had
been
eyeing
the
plan
and
the
agent
by
turns
,
merely
rejoined
"
Uncommon
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
dead
silence
ensued
,
Mr
Scadder
in
some
short
recesses
or
vacations
of
his
toothpick
,
whistled
a
few
bars
of
Yankee
Doodle
,
and
blew
the
dust
off
the
roof
of
the
Theatre
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
said
Martin
,
feigning
to
look
more
narrowly
at
the
plan
,
but
showing
by
his
tremulous
voice
how
much
depended
,
in
his
mind
,
upon
the
answer
;
"
I
suppose
there
are
---
several
architects
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
a
single
one
,
"
said
Scadder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
,
"
whispered
Martin
,
pulling
him
by
the
sleeve
,
"
do
you
hear
that
?
 
<EOS>
But
whose
work
is
all
this
before
us
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
soil
being
very
fruitful
,
public
buildings
grows
spontaneous
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
agent
's
dark
side
as
he
said
it
;
but
Scadder
instantly
changed
his
place
,
and
brought
his
active
eye
to
bear
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Feel
of
my
hands
,
young
man
,
"
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mark
,
declining
.
   
<EOS>
"
Air
they
dirty
,
or
air
they
clean
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
said
Scadder
,
holding
them
out
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
physical
point
of
view
they
were
decidedly
dirty
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
being
obvious
that
Mr
Scadder
offered
them
for
examination
in
a
figurative
sense
,
as
emblems
of
his
moral
character
,
Martin
hastened
to
pronounce
them
pure
as
the
driven
snow
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
entreat
,
Mark
,
"
he
said
,
with
some
irritation
,
"
that
you
will
not
obtrude
remarks
of
that
nature
,
which
,
however
harmless
and
well
-
intentioned
,
are
quite
out
of
place
,
and
can
not
be
expected
to
be
very
agreeable
to
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Co.
's
a
-
putting
his
foot
in
it
already
,
"
thought
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
a
sleeping
partner
---
fast
asleep
and
snoring
---
<EOS>
Co.
must
;
I
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Scadder
said
nothing
,
but
he
set
his
back
against
the
plan
,
and
thrust
his
toothpick
into
the
desk
some
twenty
times
;
looking
at
Mark
all
the
while
as
if
he
were
stabbing
him
in
effigy
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
said
whose
work
it
is
,
"
Martin
ventured
to
observe
at
length
,
in
a
tone
of
mild
propitiation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
never
mind
whose
work
it
is
,
or
is
n't
,
"
said
the
agent
sulkily
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
how
it
did
eventuate
.
 
<EOS>
P'raps
he
cleared
off
,
handsome
,
with
a
heap
of
dollars
;
p'raps
he
was
n't
worth
a
cent
.
<EOS>
P'raps
he
was
a
loafin
'
rowdy
;
p'raps
a
ring
-
tailed
roarer
.
 
<EOS>
Now
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
All
your
doing
,
Mark
!
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
P'raps
,
"
pursued
the
agent
,
"
them
ai
n't
plants
of
Eden
's
raising
.
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
P'raps
that
desk
and
stool
ai
n't
made
from
Eden
lumber
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
P'raps
<EOS>
no
end
of
squatters
ai
n't
gone
out
there
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
P'raps
<EOS>
there
ai
n't
no
such
location
in
the
territoary
of
the
Great
U
-
nited
States
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
're
satisfied
with
the
success
of
your
joke
,
Mark
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
But
here
,
at
a
most
opportune
and
happy
time
,
the
General
interposed
,
and
called
out
to
Scadder
from
the
doorway
to
give
his
friends
the
particulars
of
that
little
lot
of
fifty
acres
with
the
house
upon
it
;
which
,
having
belonged
to
the
company
formerly
,
had
lately
lapsed
again
into
their
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
air
a
deal
too
open
-
handed
,
Gen'ral
,
"
was
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
lot
as
should
be
rose
in
price
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
grumblingly
opened
his
books
notwithstanding
,
and
always
keeping
his
bright
side
towards
Mark
,
no
matter
at
what
amount
of
inconvenience
to
himself
,
displayed
a
certain
leaf
for
their
perusal
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
read
it
greedily
,
and
then
inquired
:
   
"
Now
where
upon
the
plan
may
this
place
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
the
plan
?
"
said
Scadder
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
turned
towards
it
,
and
reflected
for
a
short
time
,
as
if
,
having
been
put
upon
his
mettle
,
he
was
resolved
to
be
particular
to
the
very
minutest
hair
's
breadth
of
a
shade
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
wheeling
his
toothpick
slowly
round
and
round
in
the
air
,
as
if
it
were
a
carrier
pigeon
just
thrown
up
,
he
suddenly
made
a
dart
at
the
drawing
,
and
pierced
the
very
centre
of
the
main
wharf
,
through
and
through
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
he
said
,
leaving
his
knife
quivering
in
the
wall
;
"
that
's
where
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
glanced
with
sparkling
eyes
upon
his
Co.
,
and
his
Co.
saw
that
the
thing
was
done
.
   
<EOS>
The
bargain
was
not
concluded
as
easily
as
might
have
been
expected
though
,
for
Scadder
was
caustic
and
ill
-
humoured
,
and
cast
much
unnecessary
opposition
in
the
way
;
at
one
time
requesting
them
to
think
of
it
,
and
call
again
in
a
week
or
a
fortnight
;
at
another
,
predicting
that
they
would
n't
like
it
;
at
another
,
offering
to
retract
and
let
them
off
,
and
muttering
strong
imprecations
upon
the
folly
of
the
General
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
whole
of
the
astoundingly
small
sum
total
of
purchase
-
money
<EOS>
---
it
was
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
,
or
something
more
than
thirty
pounds
of
the
capital
brought
by
Co.
into
the
architectural
concern
---
was
ultimately
paid
down
;
and
Martin
's
head
was
<EOS>
two
inches
nearer
the
roof
of
the
little
wooden
office
,
with
the
consciousness
of
being
a
landed
proprietor
in
the
thriving
city
of
Eden
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
should
n't
happen
to
fit
,
"
said
Scadder
,
as
he
gave
Martin
the
necessary
credentials
on
recepit
of
his
money
,
"
do
n't
blame
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
he
replied
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
not
blame
you
.
 
<EOS>
General
,
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
your
service
,
sir
;
and
I
wish
you
,
"
said
the
General
,
giving
him
his
hand
with
grave
cordiality
,
"
joy
of
your
po
-
ssession
.
<EOS>
You
air
now
,
sir
,
a
denizen
of
the
most
powerful
and
highly
-
civilised
dominion
that
has
ever
graced
the
world
;
a
do
-
minion
,
sir
,
where
man
is
bound
to
man
in
one
vast
bond
of
equal
love
and
truth
.
<EOS>
May
you
,
sir
,
be
worthy
of
your
a
-
dopted
country
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
thanked
him
,
and
took
leave
of
Mr
Scadder
;
who
had
resumed
his
post
in
the
rocking
-
chair
,
immediately
on
the
General
's
rising
from
it
,
and
was
once
more
swinging
away
as
if
he
had
never
been
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
looked
back
several
times
as
they
went
down
the
road
towards
the
National
Hotel
,
but
now
his
blighted
profile
was
towards
them
,
and
nothing
but
attentive
thoughtfulness
was
written
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
Strangely
different
to
the
other
side
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
man
much
given
to
laughing
,
and
never
laughed
outright
;
but
every
line
in
the
print
of
the
crow
's
foot
,
and
every
little
wiry
vein
in
that
division
of
his
head
,
was
wrinkled
up
into
a
grin
!
 
<EOS>
The
compound
figure
of
Death
and
the
Lady
at
the
top
of
the
old
ballad
was
not
divided
with
a
greater
nicety
,
and
had
n't
halves
more
monstrously
unlike
each
other
,
than
the
two
profiles
of
Zephaniah
Scadder
.
   
<EOS>
The
General
posted
along
at
a
great
rate
,
for
the
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
;
and
at
that
hour
precisely
,
the
Great
Meeting
of
the
Watertoast
Sympathisers
was
to
be
holden
in
the
public
room
of
the
National
Hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Being
very
curious
to
witness
the
demonstration
,
and
know
what
it
was
all
about
,
Martin
kept
close
to
the
General
;
and
,
keeping
closer
than
ever
when
they
entered
the
Hall
,
got
by
that
means
upon
a
little
platform
of
tables
at
the
upper
end
;
where
an
armchair
was
set
for
the
General
,
and
Mr
La
Fayette
Kettle
,
as
secretary
,
was
making
a
great
display
of
some
foolscap
documents
.
 
<EOS>
Screamers
,
no
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
he
shook
hands
with
Martin
,
"
here
is
a
spectacle
calc'lated
to
make
the
British
Lion
put
his
tail
between
his
legs
,
and
howl
with
anguish
,
I
expect
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
certainly
thought
it
possible
that
the
British
Lion
might
have
been
rather
out
of
his
element
in
that
Ark
;
but
he
kept
the
idea
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
General
was
then
voted
to
the
chair
,
on
the
motion
of
a
pallid
lad
of
the
Jefferson
Brick
school
;
who
forthwith
set
in
for
a
high
-
spiced
speech
,
with
a
good
deal
about
hearths
and
homes
in
it
,
and
unriveting
the
chains
of
Tyranny
.
   
<EOS>
Oh
<EOS>
but
it
was
a
clincher
for
the
British
Lion
,
it
was
!
 
<EOS>
The
indignation
of
the
glowing
young
Columbian
knew
no
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
could
only
have
been
one
of
his
own
forefathers
,
he
said
,
would
n't
he
have
peppered
that
same
Lion
,
and
been
to
him
as
another
Brute
Tamer
with
a
wire
whip
,
teaching
him
lessons
not
easily
forgotten
.
"
<EOS>
Lion
!
<EOS>
(
cried
that
young
Columbian
)
<EOS>
where
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
Show
him
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
have
him
here
.
 
<EOS>
Here
!
"
said
the
young
Columbian
,
in
a
wrestling
attitude
,
"
upon
this
sacred
altar
.
<EOS>
Here
!
"
cried
the
young
Columbian
,
idealising
the
dining
-
table
,
"
upon
ancestral
ashes
,
cemented
with
the
glorious
blood
poured
out
like
water
on
our
native
plains
of
Chickabiddy
Lick
!
 
<EOS>
Bring
forth
that
Lion
!
"
said
the
young
Columbian
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alone
,
I
dare
him
!
 
<EOS>
I
taunt
that
Lion
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
that
Lion
,
that
Freedom
's
hand
once
twisted
in
his
mane
,
he
rolls
a
corse
before
me
,
and
the
Eagles
of
the
Great
Republic
<EOS>
laugh
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
When
it
was
found
that
the
Lion
did
n't
come
,
but
kept
out
of
the
way
;
that
the
young
Columbian
stood
there
,
with
folded
arms
,
alone
in
his
glory
;
and
consequently
that
the
Eagles
were
no
doubt
laughing
wildly
on
the
mountain
tops
;
such
cheers
arose
as
might
have
shaken
the
hands
upon
the
Horse
-
Guards
'
clock
,
and
changed
the
very
mean
time
of
the
day
in
England
's
capital
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
Martin
telegraphed
to
La
Fayette
.
   
<EOS>
The
Secretary
wrote
something
,
very
gravely
,
on
a
piece
of
paper
,
twisted
it
up
,
and
had
it
passed
to
him
from
hand
to
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
improvement
on
the
old
sentiment
:
"
Perhaps
as
remarkable
a
man
as
any
in
our
country
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
young
Columbian
was
succeeded
by
another
,
to
the
full
as
eloquent
as
he
,
who
drew
down
storms
of
cheers
.
 
<EOS>
But
both
remarkable
youths
,
in
their
great
excitement
(
for
your
true
poetry
can
never
stoop
to
details
)
<EOS>
,
forgot
to
say
with
whom
or
what
the
Watertoasters
sympathized
,
and
likewise
why
or
wherefore
they
were
sympathetic
.
<EOS>
Thus
Martin
remained
for
a
long
time
as
completely
in
the
dark
as
ever
;
until
at
length
a
ray
of
light
broke
in
upon
him
through
the
medium
of
the
Secretary
,
who
,
by
reading
the
minutes
of
their
past
proceedings
,
made
the
matter
somewhat
clearer
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
learned
that
the
Watertoast
Association
sympathized
with
a
certain
Public
Man
in
Ireland
,
who
held
a
contest
upon
certain
points
with
England
;
and
that
they
did
so
,
because
they
did
n't
love
England
at
all
---
not
by
any
means
because
they
loved
Ireland
much
;
being
indeed
horribly
jealous
and
distrustful
of
its
people
always
,
and
only
tolerating
them
because
of
their
working
hard
,
which
made
them
very
useful
;
labour
being
held
in
greater
indignity
in
the
simple
republic
than
in
any
other
country
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
This
rendered
Martin
curious
to
see
what
grounds
of
sympathy
<EOS>
the
Watertoast
Association
put
forth
;
nor
was
he
long
in
suspense
,
for
the
General
rose
to
read
a
letter
to
the
Public
Man

In

I
advert
with
indignation

disgust
to
that
accursed
animal

with
gore

stained

rampant
cruelty

"
   
<EOS>
It
happened
that
just
as
the
General
began
to
read
this
letter
,
the
railroad
train
arrived
,
bringing
a
new
mail
from
England
;
and
a
packet
had
been
handed
in
to
the
Secretary
,
which
during
its
perusal
and
the
frequent
cheerings
in
homage
to
freedom
,
he
had
opened
.
<EOS>
Now
,
its
contents
disturbed
him
very
much
,
and
the
moment
the
General
sat
down
,
he
hurried
to
his
side
,
and
placed
in
his
hand
a
letter
and
several
printed
extracts
from
English
newspapers
;
to
which
,
in
a
state
of
infinite
excitement
,
he
called
his
immediate
attention
.
   
<EOS>
The
General
,
being
greatly
heated
by
his
own
composition
,
was
in
a
fit
state
to
receive
any
inflammable
influence
;
but
he
had
no
sooner
possessed
himself
of
the
contents
of
these
documents
,
than
a
change
came
over
his
face
,
involving
such
a
huge
amount
of
choler
and
passion
,
that
the
noisy
concourse
were
silent
in
a
moment
,
in
very
wonder
at
the
sight
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
friends
!
"
cried
the
General
,
rising
;
"
my
friends
and
fellow
citizens
,
we
have
been
mistaken
in
this
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
what
man
?
"
was
the
cry
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
this
,
"
panted
the
General
,
holding
up
the
letter
he
had
read
aloud
a
few
minutes
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
that
he
has
been
,
and
is
,
the
advocate
---
consistent
in
it
always
too
---
of
Nigger
emancipation
!
"
   
<EOS>
If
anything
beneath
the
sky
be
real
,
those
Sons
of
Freedom
would
have
pistolled
,
stabbed
---
<EOS>
in
some
way
slain
---
<EOS>
that
man
by
coward
hands
and
murderous
violence
,
if
he
had
stood
among
them
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
The
most
confiding
of
their
own
countrymen
would
not
have
wagered
then
---
no
,
nor
would
they
ever
peril
---
<EOS>
one
dunghill
straw
,
upon
the
life
of
any
man
in
such
a
strait
.
 
<EOS>
They
tore
the
letter
,
cast
the
fragments
in
the
air
,
trod
down
the
pieces
as
they
fell
;
and
yelled
,
and
groaned
,
and
hissed
,
till
they
could
cry
no
longer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
move
,
"
said
the
General
,
when
he
could
make
himself
heard
,
"
that
the
Watertoast
Association
of
United
Sympathisers
be
immediately
dissolved
!
"
   
<EOS>
Down
with
it
!
 
<EOS>
Away
with
it
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
hear
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
Burn
its
records
!
<EOS>
Pull
the
room
down
!
 
<EOS>
Blot
it
out
of
human
memory
!
   
<EOS>
"
But
,

fellow
-
countrymen
!
"
said
the
General
,
"
the
contributions
.
<EOS>
We
have
funds
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
to
be
done
with
the
funds
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
hastily
resolved
that
a
piece
of
plate
should
be
presented
to
a
certain
constitutional
Judge
,
who
had
laid
down
from
the
Bench
the
noble
principle
that
it
was
lawful
for
any
white
mob
to
murder
any
black
man
;
and
that
another
piece
of
plate
,
of
similar
value
should
be
presented
to
a
certain
Patriot
,
who
had
declared
from
his
high
place
in
the
Legislature
,
that
he
and
his
friends
would
hang
without
trial
,
any
Abolitionist
who
might
pay
them
a
visit
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
surplus
,
it
was
agreed
that
it
should
be
devoted
to
aiding
the
enforcement
of
those
free
and
equal
laws
,
which
render
it
incalculably
more
criminal
and
dangerous
to
teach
a
negro
to
read
and
write
than
to
roast
him
alive
in
a
public
city
.
 
<EOS>
These
points
adjusted
,
the
meeting
broke
up
in
great
disorder
,
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
Watertoast
Sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
As
Martin
ascended
to
his
bedroom
,
his
eye
was
attracted
by
the
Republican
banner
,
which
had
been
hoisted
from
the
house
-
top
in
honour
of
the
occasion
,
and
was
fluttering
before
a
window
which
he
passed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
!
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
gay
flag
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
a
man
be
near
enough
to
get
the
light
upon
the
other
side
and
see
through
you
;
and
you
are
but
sorry
fustian
!
"
    
<EOS>
Chapter
22
.
<EOS>
From
which
it
will
be
seen
that
Martin
became
a
lion
of
his
own
Aacount
.
 
<EOS>
Together
with
the
reason
why
 
As
soon
as
it
was
generally
known
in
the
National
Hotel
,
that
the
young
Englishman
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
had
purchased
a
"
lo
-
cation
"
in
the
Valley
of
Eden
,
and
intended
to
betake
himself
to
that
earthly
Paradise
by
the
next
steamboat
,
he
became
a
popular
character
.
 
<EOS>
Why
this
should
be
,
or
how
it
had
come
to
pass
,
Martin
no
more
knew
than
Mrs
Gamp
,
of
Kingsgate
Street
,
High
Holborn
,
did
;
but
that
he
was
for
the
time
being
the
lion
,
by
popular
election
,
of
the
Watertoast
community
,
and
that
his
society
was
in
rather
inconvenient
request
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
kind
of
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
notification
he
received
of
this
change
in
his
position
,
was
the
following
epistle
,
written
in
a
thin
running
hand
---
with
here
and
there
a
fat
letter
or
two
,
to
make
the
general
effect
more
striking

through

kindly
came
upstairs
to

on

The

sat
down
upon

spoke

finding
it
rather
hard

moved
to

pillow

"
Well

the

putting
his
hat
a
little
more

rather
tight
in

looked
despairingly

informed

meant
a

notice
that

at

"

Martin
was
going
to
be
very
wroth

he
thought
better
of
it

said

.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
will
you
,
"
said
Martin
,
seeing
that
the
Captain
was
about
to
go
;
"
will
you
at
least
tell
me
this
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
they
want
to
see
me
for
?
<EOS>
what
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
and
how
do
they
happen
to
have
such
a
sudden
interest
in
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Captain
Kedgick
put
a
thumb
and
three
fingers
to
each
side
of
the
brim
of
his
hat
;
lifted
it
a
little
way
off
his
head
;
put
it
on
again
carefully
;
passed
one
hand
all
down
his
face
,
beginning
at
the
forehead
and
ending
at
the
chin
;
looked
at
Martin
;
then
at
Mark
;
then
at
Martin
again
;
winked
,
and
walked
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
,
now
!
"
said
Martin
,
bringing
his
hand
heavily
upon
the
table
;
"
such
a
perfectly
unaccountable
fellow
as
that
,
I
never
saw
.
<EOS>
Mark
,
what
do
you
say
to
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
returned
his
partner
,
"
my
opinion
is
that
we
must
have
got
to
the
MOST
remarkable
man
in
the
country
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
hope
there
's
an
end
to
the
breed
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Although
this
made
Martin
laugh
,
it
could
n't
keep
off
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Punctually
,
as
the
hour
struck
,
Captain
Kedgick
returned
to
hand
him
to
the
room
of
state
;
and
he
had
no
sooner
got
him
safe
there
,
than
he
bawled
down
the
staircase
to
his
fellow
-
citizens
below
,
that
Mr
Chuzzlewit
was
"
receiving
.
"
   
<EOS>
Up
<EOS>
they
came
with
a
rush
.
 
<EOS>
Up
<EOS>
they
came
until
the
room
was
full
,
and
,
through
the
open
door
,
a
dismal
perspective
of
more
to
come
,
was
shown
upon
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
One
after
another
,
one
after
another
,
dozen
after
dozen
,
score
after
score
,
more
,
more
,
more
,
up
they
came
;
all
shaking
hands
with
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
Such
varieties
of
hands
,
the
thick
,
the
thin
,
the
short
,
the
long
,
the
fat
,
the
lean
,
the
coarse
,
the
fine
;
such
differences
of
temperature
,
the
hot
,
the
cold
,
the
dry
,
the
moist
,
the
flabby
;
such
diversities
of
grasp
,
the
tight
,
the
loose
,
the
short
-
lived
,
and
the
lingering
!
 
<EOS>
Still
up
,
up
,
up
,
more
,
more
,
more
;
and
ever
and
anon
the
Captain
's
voice
was
heard
above
the
crowd
---
<EOS>
"
There
's
more
below
!
<EOS>
there
's
more
below
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
gentlemen
you
that
have
been
introduced
to
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
<EOS>
will
you
clear
gentlemen
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
clear
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
be
so
good
as
clear
,
gentlemen
,
and
make
a
little
room
for
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
Regardless
of
the
Captain
's
cries
,
they
did
n't
clear
at
all
,
but
stood
there
,
bolt
upright
and
staring
.
 
<EOS>
Two
gentlemen
connected
with
the
Watertoast
Gazette
had
come
express
to
get
the
matter
for
an
article
on
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
agreed
to
divide
the
labour
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
took
him
below
the
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
One
above
.
 
<EOS>
Each
stood
directly
in
front
of
his
subject
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
,
intent
on
his
department
.
 
<EOS>
If
Martin
put
one
boot
before
the
other
,
the
lower
gentleman
was
down
upon
him
;
he
rubbed
a
pimple
on
his
nose
,
and
the
upper
gentleman
booked
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
,
and
the
same
gentleman
was
on
one
knee
before
him
,
looking
in
at
his
teeth
,
with
the
nice
scrutiny
of
a
dentist
.
 
<EOS>
Amateurs
in
the
physiognomical
and
phrenological
sciences
roved
about
him
with
watchful
eyes
and
itching
fingers
,
and
sometimes
one
,
more
daring
than
the
rest
,
made
a
mad
grasp
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
vanished
in
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
him
in
all
points
of
view
:
in
front
,
in
profile
,
three
-
quarter
face
,
and
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
were
not
professional
or
scientific
,
audibly
exchanged
opinions
on
his
looks
.
 
<EOS>
New
lights
shone
in
upon
him
,
in
respect
of
his
nose
.
<EOS>
Contradictory
rumours
were
abroad
on
the
subject
of
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
And
still
the
Captain
's
voice
was
heard
---
<EOS>
so
stifled
by
the
concourse
,
that
he
seemed
to
speak
from
underneath
a
feather
-
bed
---
exclaiming
---
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
you
that
have
been
introduced
to
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
WILL
you
clear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Even
when
they
began
to
clear
it
was
no
better
;
for
then
a
stream
of
gentlemen
,
every
one
with
a
lady
on
each
arm
(
exactly
like
the
chorus
to
the
National
Anthem
when
Royalty
goes
in
state
to
the
play
)
,
came
gliding
in
---
every
new
group
fresher
than
the
last
,
and
bent
on
staying
to
the
latest
moment
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
spoke
to
him
,
which
was
not
often
,
they
invariably
asked
the
same
questions
,
in
the
same
tone
;
with
no
more
remorse
,
or
delicacy
,
or
consideration
,
than
if
he
had
been
a
figure
of
stone
,
purchased
,
and
paid
for
,
and
set
up
there
for
their
delight
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
,
in
the
slow
course
of
time
,
these
died
off
,
it
was
as
bad
as
ever
,
if
not
worse
;
for
then
the
boys
grew
bold
,
and
came
in
as
a
class
of
themselves
,
and
did
everything
that
the
grown
-
up
people
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
Uncouth
stragglers
,
too
,
appeared
;
men
of
a
ghostly
kind
,
who
being
in
,
did
n't
know
how
to
get
out
again
;
insomuch
that
one
silent
gentleman
with
glazed
and
fishy
eyes
and
only
one
button
on
his
waistcoat
(
which
was
a
very
large
metal
one
,
and
shone
prodigiously
)
,
got
behind
the
door
,
and
stood
there
,
like
a
clock
,
long
after
everybody
else
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
felt
,
from
pure
fatigue
,
and
heat
,
and
worry
,
as
if
he
could
have
fallen
on
the
ground
and
willingly
remained
there
,
if
they
would
but
have
had
the
mercy
to
leave
him
alone
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
letters
and
messages
,
threatening
his
public
denouncement
if
he
did
n't
see
the
senders
,
poured
in
like
hail
;
and
as
more
visitors
came
while
he
took
his
coffee
by
himself
;
and
as
Mark
,
with
all
his
vigilance
,
was
unable
to
keep
them
from
the
door
;
he
resolved
to
go
to
bed
---
<EOS>
not
that
he
felt
at
all
sure
of
bed
being
any
protection
,
but
that
he
might
not
leave
a
forlorn
hope
untried
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
communicated
this
design
to
Mark
,
and
was
on
the
eve
of
escaping
,
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
an
elderly
gentleman
entered
;
bringing
with
him
a
lady
who
certainly
could
not
be
considered
young
---
that
was
matter
of
fact
;
and
probably
could
not
be
considered
handsome
---
but
that
was
matter
of
opinion
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
straight
,
very
tall
,
and
not
at
all
flexible
in
face
or
figure
.
 
<EOS>
On
her
head
she
wore
a
great
straw
bonnet
,
with
trimmings
of
the
same
,
in
which
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
thatched
by
an
unskillful
labourer
;
and
in
her
hand
she
held
a
most
enormous
fan
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
I
believe
?
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
I
am
pressed
for
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
go
back
<EOS>
Toe
<EOS>
my
home
,
sir
,
"
pursued
the
gentleman
,
"
by
the
return
train
,
which
starts
immediate
.
 
<EOS>
Start
is
not
a
word
you
use
in
your
country
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
it
is
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
air
mistaken
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
gentleman
,
with
great
decision
:
"
but
we
will
not
pursue
the
subject
,
lest
it
should
awake
your
preju
---
dice
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
Mrs
Hominy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
bowed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Hominy
,
sir
,
is
the
lady
of
Major
Hominy
,
one
of
our
chicest
spirits
;
and

Toe
one
of
our
most
aristocratic
families

<EOS>
You

p'raps
,
acquainted

sir
,
with
Mrs
Hominy

writings

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
could
n't
say
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
much
Toe
learn
,
and
Toe
enjoy
,
sir
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Hominy
is
going
<EOS>
Toe
stay
until
the
end
of
the
Fall
,
sir
,
with
her
married
daughter
at
the
settlement
of
New
Thermopylae
,
three
days
this
side
of
Eden
.
 
<EOS>
Any
attention

that
you
can
show

Mrs
Hominy
upon

will
be
very
grateful

<EOS>
Mrs
Hominy
,
I
wish
you
good
night
,
ma'am
,
and
a
pleasant
pro
-
gress
on
your
route
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
could
scarcely
believe
it
;
but
he
had
gone
,
and
Mrs
Hominy
was
drinking
the
milk
.
   
<EOS>
"
A'most
used
-
up
I
am
,
I
do
declare
!
"
<EOS>
she
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
jolting
in
the
cars
is
pretty
nigh
as
bad
as
if
the
rail
was
full
of
snags
and
sawyers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Snags
and
sawyers
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
do
suppose
you
'll
hardly
realise
my
meaning
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Hominy
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
!
 
<EOS>
Only
think
!
 
<EOS>
DO
tell
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
did
not
appear
that
these
expressions
,
although
they
seemed
to
conclude
with
an
urgent
entreaty
,
stood
in
need
of
any
answer
;
for
Mrs
Hominy
,
untying
her
bonnet
-
strings
,
<EOS>
observed
that
she
would
withdraw
to
lay
that
article
of
dress
aside
,
and
would
return
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
!
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Touch
me
,
will
you
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
awake
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hominy
is
,
sir
,
"
returned
his
partner
---
"
Broad
awake
!
 
<EOS>
Just
the
sort
of
woman
,
sir
<EOS>
,
as
would
be
discovered
with
her
eyes
wide
open
,
and
her
mind
a
-
working
for
her
country
's
good
,
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
had
no
opportunity
of
saying
more
,
for
Mrs
Hominy
stalked
in
again
---
<EOS>
very
erect
,
in
proof
of
her
aristocratic
blood
;
and
holding
in
her
clasped
hands
a
red
cotton
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
perhaps
a
parting
gift
from
that
choice
spirit
,
the
Major
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
laid
aside
her
bonnet
,
and
now
appeared
in
a
highly
aristocratic
and
classical
cap
,
meeting
beneath
her
chin
:
a
style
of
headdress
so
admirably
adapted
to
her
countenance
,
that
if
the
late
Mr
Grimaldi
had
appeared
in
the
lappets
of
Mrs
Siddons
,
a
more
complete
effect
could
not
have
been
produced
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
handed
her
to
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Her
first
words
arrested
him
before
he
could
get
back
to
his
own
seat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
!
"
said
Mrs
Hominy
,
"
where
do
you
hail
from
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
am
dull
of
comprehension
,
"
answered
Martin
,
"
being
extremely
tired
;
but
upon
my
word
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Hominy
shook
her
head
with
a
melancholy
smile
that
said
,
not
inexpressively
,
"
They
corrupt
even
the
language
in
that
old
country
!
"
and
added
then
,
as
coming
down
a
step
or
two
to
meet
his
low
capacity
,
"
Where
was
you
rose
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Martin
"
<EOS>
I
was
born
in
Kent
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
you
like
our
country
,
sir
?
"
asked
Mrs
Hominy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
indeed
,
"
said
Martin
,
half
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
---
that
is
---
 
pretty
well
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Most
strangers
---
and
partick'larly
Britishers
---
are
much
surprised
by
what
they
see
in
the
U
-
nited
States
,
"
remarked
Mrs
Hominy
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
excellent
reason
to
be
so
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
so
much
surprised
in
all
my
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Our
institutions
make
our
people
smart
much
,
sir
,
"
Mrs
Hominy
remarked
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
most
short
-
sighted
man
could
see
that
at
a
glance
,
with
his
naked
eye
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Hominy
was
a
philosopher
and
an
authoress
,
and
consequently
had
a
pretty
strong
digestion
;
but
this
coarse
,
this
indecorous
phrase
,
was
almost
too
much
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
gentleman
sitting
alone
with
a
lady
---
although
the
door
WAS
open
---
to
talk
about
a
naked
eye
!
   
<EOS>
A
long
interval
elapsed
before
even
she
---
woman
of
masculine
and
towering
intellect
though
she
was
---
could
call
up
fortitude
enough
to
resume
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Hominy
was
a
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Hominy
was
a
writer
of
reviews
and
analytical
disquisitions
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Hominy
had
had
her
letters
from
abroad
,
beginning
"
My
ever
dearest
blank
,
"
and
signed
"
The
Mother
of
the
Modern
Gracchi
"
(
meaning
the
married
Miss
Hominy
)
,
regularly
printed
in
a
public
journal
,
with
all
the
indignation
in
capitals
,
and
all
the
sarcasm
in
italics
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Hominy
had
looked
on
foreign
countries
with
the
eye
of
a
perfect
republican
hot
from
the
model
oven
;
and
Mrs
Hominy
could
talk

<EOS>
So
Mrs
Hominy
at
last
came
down
on
Martin
heavily
,
and
as
he
was
fast
asleep
,
she
had
it
all
her
own
way
,
and
bruised
him
to
her
heart
's
content
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
no
great
matter
what
Mrs
Hominy
said
,
<EOS>
save
that
she
had
learnt
it
from
the
ca
nt
of
a
class
,
and
a
large
class
,
of
her
fellow
countrymen
,
who
in
their
every
word
,
avow
themselves
to
be
as
senseless
to
the
high
principles
on
which
America
sprang
,
a
nation
,
into
life
,
as
any
Orson
in
her
legislative
halls
.
 
<EOS>
Who
are
no
more
capable
of
feeling
,
or
of
caring
if
they
did
feel
,
that
by
reducing
their
own
country
to
the
ebb
of
honest
men
's
contempt
,
they
put
in
hazard
the
rights
of
nations
yet
unborn
,
and
very
progress
of
the
human
race
,
than
are
the
swine
who
wallow
in
their
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Who
think
that
crying
out
to
other
nations
,
old
in
their
iniquity
,
"
We
are
no
worse
than
you
!
"
<EOS>
(
No
worse
!
)
<EOS>
is
high
defence
and
"
vantage
-
ground
enough
for
that
Republic
,
but
yesterday
let
loose
upon
her
noble
course
,
and
but
to
-
day
so
maimed
and
lame
,
so
full
of
sores
and
ulcers
,
foul
to
the
eye
and
almost
hopeless
to
the
sense
,
that
her
best
friends
turn
from
the
loathsome
creature
with
disgust
.
<EOS>
Who
,
having
by
their
ancestors
declared
and
won
their
Independence
,
because
they
would
not
bend
the
knee
to
certain
Public
vices
and
corruptions
,
and
would
not
abrogate
the
truth
,
run
riot
in
the
Bad
,
and
turn
their
backs
upon
the
Good
;
and
lying
down
contented
with
the
wretched
boast
that
other
Temples
also
are
of
glass
,
and
stones
which
batter
theirs
may
be
flung
back
;
show
themselves
,
in
that
alone
,
as
immeasurably
behind
the
import
of
the
trust
they
hold
,
and
as
unworthy
to
possess
it
as
if
the
sordid
hucksterings
of
all
their
little
governments
---
each
one
a
kingdom
in
its
small
depravity
---
were
brought
into
a
heap
for
evidence
against
them
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
by
degrees
became
so
far
awake
,
that
he
had
a
sense
of
a
terrible
oppression
on
his
mind
;
an
imperfect
dream
that
he
had
murdered
a
particular
friend
,
and
could
n't
get
rid
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
When
his
eyes
opened
it
was
staring
him
full
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
horrible
Hominy
talking
deep
truths
in
a
melodious
snuffle
,
and
pouring
forth
her
mental
endowments
to
such
an
extent
that
the
Major
's
bitterest
enemy
,
hearing
her
,
would
have
forgiven
him
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
might
have
done
something
desperate
if
the
gong
had
not
sounded
for
supper
;
but
sound
<EOS>
it
did
most
opportunely
;
and
having
stationed
Mrs
Hominy
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
he
took
refuge
at
the
lower
end
himself
;
whence
,
after
a
hasty
meal
he
stole
away
,
while
the
lady
was
yet
busied
with
dried
beef
and
a
saucer
-
full
of
pickled
fixings
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
give
an
adequate
idea
of
Mrs
Hominy
's
freshness
next
day
,
or
of
the
avidity
with
which
she
went
headlong
into
moral
philosophy
at
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Some
little
additional
degree
of
asperity
,
perhaps
,
was
visible
in
her
features
,
but
not
more
than
the
pickles
would
have
naturally
produced
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
day
she
clung
to
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
beside
him
while
he
received
his
friends
(
for
there
was
another
Reception
,
yet
more
numerous
than
the
former
)
,
propounded
theories
,
and
answered
imaginary
objections
,
so
that
Martin
really
began
to
think
he
must
be
dreaming
,
and
speaking
for
two
;
she
quoted
interminable
passages
from
certain
essays
on
government
,
written
by
herself
;
used
the
Major
's
pocket
-
handkerchief
as
if
the
snuffle
were
a
temporary
malady
,
of
which
she
was
determined
to
rid
herself
by
some
means
or
other
;
and
,
in
short
,
was
such
a
remarkable
companion
,
that
Martin
quite
settled
it
between
himself
and
his
conscience
,
that
in
any
new
settlement
it
would
be
absolutely
necessary
to
have
such
a
person
knocked
on
the
head
for
the
general
peace
of
society
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mark
was
busy
,
from
early
in
the
morning
until
late
at
night
,
in
getting
on
board
the
steamboat
such
provisions
,
tools
and
other
necessaries
,
as
they
had
been
forewarned
it
would
be
wise
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
The
purchase
of
these
things
,
and
the
settlement
of
their
bill
at
the
National
,
reduced
their
finances
to
so
low
an
ebb
,
that
if
the
captain
had
delayed
his
departure
any
longer
,
they
would
have
been
in
almost
as
bad
a
plight
as
the
unfortunate
poorer
emigrants
,
who
(
seduced
on
board
by
solemn
advertisement
)
had
been
living
on
the
lower
deck
a
whole
week
,
and
exhausting
their
miserable
stock
of
provisions
before
the
voyage
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
There
they
were
,
all
huddled
together
with
the
engine
and
the
fires
.
 
<EOS>
Farmers
who
had
never
seen
a
plough
;
woodmen
who
had
never
used
an
axe
;
builders
who
could
n't
make
a
box
;
cast
out
of
their
own
land
,
with
not
a
hand
to
aid
them
:
newly
come
into
an
unknown
world
,
children
in
helplessness
,
but
men
in
wants
---
with
younger
children
at
their
backs
,
to
live
or
die
as
it
might
happen
!
   
<EOS>
The
morning
came
,
and
they
would
start
at
noon
.
 
<EOS>
Noon
came
,
and
they
would
start
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
is
eternal
in
this
world
;
not
even
the
procrastination
of
an
American
skipper
;
and
at
night
all
was
ready
.
   
<EOS>
Dispirited
and
weary
to
the
last
degree
,
but
a
greater
lion
than
ever
<EOS>
(
he
had
done
nothing
all
the
afternoon
but
answer
letters
from
strangers
;
half
of
them
about
nothing
;
half
about
borrowing
money
,
and
all
requiring
an
instantaneous
reply
)
,
Martin
walked
down
to
the
wharf
,
through
a
concourse
of
people
,
with
Mrs
Hominy
upon
his
arm
;
and
went
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mark
was
bent
on
solving
the
riddle
of
this
lionship
,
if
he
could
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
not
without
the
risk
of
being
left
behind
,
ran
back
to
the
hotel
.
   
<EOS>
Captain
Kedgick
was
sitting
in
the
colonnade
,
with
a
julep
on
his
knee
,
and
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
He
caught
Mark
's
eye
,
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
"
Tarnal
brings
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
plainly
what
it
is
,
Captain
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
man
may
ASK
a
question
,
so
he
may
,
"
returned
Kedgick
;
strongly
implying
that
another
man
might
not
answer
a
question
,
so
he
might
n't
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
they
been
making
so
much
of
him
for
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mark
,
slyly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Our
people
like
ex
-
citement
,
"
answered
Kedgick
,
sucking
his
cigar
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
how
has
he
excited
'
em
?
"
asked
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
The
Captain
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
half
inclined
to
unburden
his
mind
of
a
capital
joke
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
air
a
-
going
?
"
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Going
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
every
moment
precious
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Our
people
like
ex
-
citement
,
"
said
the
Captain
,
whispering
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
ai
n't
like
emigrants
in
gin'ral
;
and
he
excited
'em
along
of
this
;
"
he
winked
and
burst
into
a
smothered
laugh
;
"
along
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Scadder
is
a
smart
man
,
and
---
and
---
nobody
as
goes
to
Eden
ever
comes
back
alive
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
wharf
was
close
at
hand
,
and
at
that
instant
Mark
could
hear
them
shouting
out
his
name
;
could
even
hear
Martin
calling
to
him
to
make
haste
,
or
they
would
be
separated
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
to
mend
the
matter
,
or
put
any
face
upon
it
but
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
the
Captain
a
parting
benediction
,
and
ran
off
like
a
race
-
horse
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
!
<EOS>
Mark
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
am
I
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Mark
,
suddenly
replying
from
the
edge
of
the
quay
,
and
leaping
at
a
bound
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
was
half
so
jolly
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
All
right
.
 
<EOS>
Haul
in
!
 
<EOS>
Go
ahead
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
sparks
from
the
wood
fire
streamed
upward
from
the
two
chimneys
,
as
if
the
vessel
were
a
great
firework
just
lighted
;
and
they
roared
away
upon
the
dark
water
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
23
.
<EOS>
Martin
and
his
partner
take
possession
of
their
estate
.
 
<EOS>
The
joyful
occasion
involves
some
further
account
of
Eden
 
There
happened
to
be
on
board
the
steamboat
<EOS>
several
gentlemen
passengers
,
of
the
same
stamp
as
Martin
's
New
York
friend
Mr
Bevan
;
and
in
their
society
he
was
cheerful
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
They
released
him
as
well
as
they
could
from
the
intellectual
entanglements
of
Mrs
Hominy
;
and
exhibited
,
in
all
they
said
and
did
,
so
much
good
sense
and
high
feeling
,
that
he
could
not
like
them
too
well
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
this
were
a
republic
of
Intellect
and
Worth
,
"
he
said
,
"
instead
of
vapouring
and
jobbing
,
they
would
not
want
the
levers
to
keep
it
in
motion
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Having
good
tools
,
and
using
bad
ones
,
"
returned
Mr
Tapley
,
"
would
look
as
if
they
was
rather
a
poor
sort
of
carpenters
,
sir
,
would
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
if
their
work
were
infinitely
above
their
powers
and
purpose
,
Mark
;
and
they
botched
it
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
best
on
it
is
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
that
when
they
do
happen
to
make
a
decent
stroke
;
such
as
better
workmen
,
with
no
such
opportunities
,
make
every
day
of
their
lives
and
think
nothing
of
---
they
begin
to
sing
out
so
surprising
loud
.
 
<EOS>
Take
notice
of
my
words
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
the
defaulting
part
of
this
here
country
pays
its
debts
---
along
of
finding
that
not
paying
'em
wo
n't
do
in
a
commercial
point
of
view
,
you
see
,
and
is
inconvenient
in
its
consequences
<EOS>
---
they
'll
take
such
a
shine
out
of
it
,
and
make
such
bragging
speeches
,
that
a
man
might
suppose
no
borrowed
money
had
ever
been
paid
afore
,
since
the
world
was
first
begun
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
they
gammon
each
other
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
<EOS>
,
I
know
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Take
notice
of
my
words
,
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
growing
profoundly
sagacious
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whether
that
is
,
"
thought
Mark
,
"
because
I
'm
a
day
's
journey
nearer
Eden
,
and
am
brightening
up
afore
<EOS>
I
die
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
P'rhaps
by
the
time
I
get
there
I
shall
have
growed
into
a
prophet
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
gave
no
utterance
to
these
sentiments
;
but
the
excessive
joviality
they
inspired
within
him
,
and
the
merriment
they
brought
upon
his
shining
face
,
were
quite
enough
for
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
Although
he
might
sometimes
profess
to
make
light
of
his
partner
's
inexhaustible
cheerfulness
,
and
might
sometimes
,
as
in
the
case
of
Zephaniah
Scadder
,
find
him
too
jocose
a
commentator
,
he
was
always
sensible
of
the
effect
of
his
example
in
rousing
him
to
hopefulness
and
courage
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
were
in
the
humour
to
profit
by
it
,
mattered
not
a
jot
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
contagious
,
and
he
could
not
choose
but
be
affected
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
they
parted
with
some
of
their
passengers
once
or
twice
a
day
,
and
took
in
others
to
replace
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
by
degrees
,
the
towns
upon
their
route
became
more
thinly
scattered
;
and
for
many
hours
together
they
would
see
no
other
habitations
than
the
huts
of
the
wood
-
cutters
,
where
the
vessel
stopped
for
fuel
.
 
<EOS>
Sky
,
wood
,
and
water
all
the
livelong
day
;
and
heat
that
blistered
everything
it
touched
.
   
<EOS>
On
they
toiled
through
great
solitudes
,
where
the
trees
upon
the
banks
grew
thick
and
close
;
and
floatad
in
the
stream
;
and
held
up
shrivelled
arms
from
out
the
river
's
depths
;
and
slid
down
from
the
margin
of
the
land
,
half
growing
,
half
decaying
,
in
the
miry
water
.
<EOS>
On
through
the
weary
day
and
melancholy
night
;
beneath
the
burning
sun
,
and
in
the
mist
and
vapour
of
the
evening
;
on
,
until
return
appeared
impossible
,
and
restoration
to
their
home
a
miserable
dream
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
now
<EOS>
but
few
people
on
board
,
and
these
few
were
as
flat
,
as
dull
,
and
stagnant
,
as
the
vegetation
that
oppressed
their
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
No
sound
of
cheerfulness
or
hope
was
heard
;
no
pleasant
talk
beguiled
the
tardy
time
;
no
little
group
made
common
cause
against
the
full
depression
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
,
at
certain
periods
,
they
swallowed
food
together
from
a
common
trough
<EOS>
,
it
might
have
been
old
Charon
's
boat
,
conveying
melancholy
shades
to
judgment
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
they
drew
near
New
Thermopylae
;
where
,
that
same
evening
,
Mrs
Hominy
would
disembark
.
 
<EOS>
A
gleam
of
comfort
sunk
into
Martin
's
bosom
when
she
told
him
this
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
needed
none
;
but
he
was
not
displeased
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
almost
night
when
they
came
alongside
the
landing
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
A
steep
bank
with
an
hotel
like
a
barn
on
the
top
of
it
;
a
wooden
store
or
two
;
and
a
few
scattered
sheds
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
sleep
here
to
-
night
,
and
go
on
in
the
morning
,
I
suppose
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
should
I
go
on
to
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
mother
of
the
modern
Gracchi
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
New
Thermopylae
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
!
<EOS>
ai
n't
I
there
?
"
said
Mrs
Hominy
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
looked
for
it
all
round
the
darkening
panorama
;
but
he
could
n't
see
it
,
and
was
obliged
to
say
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
that
's
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Hominy
,
pointing
to
the
sheds
just
mentioned
.
   
<EOS>
"
THAT
!
"
exclaimed
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
;
and
work
it
which
way
you
will
,
it
whips
Eden
,
"
said
Mrs
Hominy
,
nodding
her
head
with
great
expression
.
   
<EOS>
The
married
Miss
Hominy
,
who
had
come
on
board
with
her
husband
,
gave
to
this
statement
her
most
unqualified
support
,
as
did
that
gentleman
also
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
gratefully
declined
their
invitation
to
regale
himself
at
their
house
during
the
half
hour
of
the
vessel
's
stay
;
and
having
escorted
Mrs
Hominy
and
the
red
pocket
-
handkerchief
(
which
was
still
on
active
service
)
safely
across
the
gangway
,
returned
in
a
thoughtful
mood
to
watch
the
emigrants
as
they
removed
their
goods
ashore
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
,
as
he
stood
beside
him
,
glanced
in
his
face
from
time
to
time
;
anxious
to
discover
what
effect
this
dialogue
had
had
upon
him
,
and
not
unwilling
that
his
hopes
should
be
dashed
before
they
reached
their
destination
,
so
that
the
blow
he
feared
might
be
broken
in
its
fall
.
 
<EOS>
But
saving
that
he
sometimes
looked
up
quickly
at
the
poor
erections
on
the
hill
,
he
gave
him
no
clue
to
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
,
until
they
were
again
upon
their
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
,
"
he
said
then
,
"
are
there
really
none
but
ourselves
on
board
this
boat
who
are
bound
for
Eden
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
at
all
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
'em
,
as
you
know
,
have
stopped
short
;
and
the
few
that
are
left
are
going
further
on
.
 
<EOS>
What
matters
that
!
<EOS>
More
room
there
for
us
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
to
be
sure
!
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
was
thinking
---
"
and
there
he
paused
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
?
"
observed
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
odd
it
was
that
the
people
should
have
arranged
to
try
their
fortune
at
a
wretched
hole
like
that
,
for
instance
,
when
there
is
such
a
much
better
,
and
such
a
very
different
kind
of
place
,
near
at
hand
,
as
one
may
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
a
tone
so
very
different
from
his
usual
confidence
,
and
with
such
an
obvious
dread
of
Mark
's
reply
,
that
the
good
-
natured
fellow
was
full
of
pity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
you
know
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
as
gently
as
he
could
by
any
means
insinuate
the
observation
,
"
we
must
guard
against
being
too
sanguine
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
occasion
for
it
,
either
,
because
we
're
determined
to
make
the
best
of
everything
,
after
we
know
the
worst
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
we
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
looked
at
him
,
but
answered
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
Even
Eden
,
you
know
,
ai
n't
all
built
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
Heaven
,
man
,
"
cried
Martin
angrily
,
"
do
n't
talk
of
Eden
in
the
same
breath
with
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
mad
?
 
<EOS>
There
---
God
forgive
me
!
---
<EOS>
do
n't
think
harshly
of
me
for
my
temper
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
turned
away
,
and
walked
to
and
fro
upon
the
deck
full
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
speak
again
,
except
to
say
"
Good
night
,
"
until
next
day
;
nor
even
then
upon
this
subject
,
but
on
other
topics
quite
foreign
to
the
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
proceeded
further
on
their
track
,
and
came
more
and
more
towards
their
journey
's
end
,
the
monotonous
desolation
of
the
scene
increased
to
that
degree
,
that
for
any
redeeming
feature
it
presented
to
their
eyes
,
they
might
have
entered
,
in
the
body
,
on
the
grim
domains
of
Giant
Despair
.
 
<EOS>
A
flat
morass
,
bestrewn
with
fallen
timber
<EOS>
;
a
marsh
on
which
the
good
growth
of
the
earth
seemed
to
have
been
wrecked
and
cast
away
,
that
from
its
decomposing
ashes
vile
and
ugly
things
might
rise
;
where
the
very
trees
took
the
aspect
of
huge
weeds
,
begotten
of
the
slime
from
which
they
sprung
,
by
the
hot
sun
that
burnt
them
up
;
where
fatal
maladies
,
seeking
whom
they
might
infect
,
came
forth
at
night
in
misty
shapes
,
and
creeping
out
upon
the
water
,
hunted
them
like
spectres
until
day
;
where
even
the
blessed
sun
,
shining
down
on
festering
elements
of
corruption
and
disease
,
became
a
horror
;
this
was
the
realm
of
Hope
through
which
they
moved
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
they
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
At
Eden
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
waters
of
the
Deluge
might
have
left
it
but
a
week
before
;
so
choked
with
slime
and
matted
growth
was
the
hideous
swamp
which
bore
that
name
.
   
<EOS>
There
being
no
depth
of
water
close
in
shore
,
they
landed
from
the
vessel
's
boat
,
with
all
their
goods
beside
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
few
log
-
houses
visible
among
the
dark
trees
;
the
best
,
a
cow
-
shed
or
a
rude
stable
;
but
for
the
wharves
,
the
market
-
place
,
the
public
buildings
---
    
<EOS>
"
Here
comes
an
Edener
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
get
us
help
to
carry
these
things
up
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
a
good
heart
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Hallo
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
advanced
toward
them
through
the
thickening
gloom
,
very
slowly
;
leaning
on
a
stick
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
drew
nearer
,
they
observed
that
he
was
pale
and
worn
,
and
that
his
anxious
eyes
were
deeply
sunken
in
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
of
homespun
blue
hung
about
him
in
rags
;
his
feet
and
head
were
bare
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
on
a
stump
half
-
way
,
and
beckoned
them
to
come
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
complied
,
he
put
his
hand
upon
his
side
as
if
in
pain
,
and
while
he
fetched
his
breath
stared
at
them
,
wondering
.
   
<EOS>
"
Strangers
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
very
same
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
had
the
fever
very
bad
,
"
he
answered
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
stood
upright
these
many
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
Those
are
your
notions
I
see
,
"
pointing
to
their
property
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
n't
recommend
us
some
one
as
would
lend
a
hand
to
help
carry
'em
up
to
the
---
to
the
town
,
could
you
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
eldest
son
would
do
it
if
he
could
,
"
replied
the
man
;
"
but
today
he
has
his
chill
upon
him
,
and
is
lying
wrapped
up
in
the
blankets
.
<EOS>
My
youngest
died
last
week
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
for
it
,
governor
,
with
all
my
heart
,
"
said
Mark
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
us
.
 
<EOS>
Come
along
with
me
,
and
I
'll
give
you
an
arm
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
goods
is
safe
enough
,
sir
"
---
to
Martin
---
"
there
ai
n't
many
people
about
,
to
make
away
with
'em
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
comfort
that
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
cried
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
look
for
such
folk
here
,
"
knocking
his
stick
upon
the
ground
,
"
or
yonder
in
the
bush
,
towards
the
north
.
 
<EOS>
We
've
buried
most
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
have
gone
away
.
 
<EOS>
Them
that
we
have
here
,
do
n't
come
out
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
night
air
ai
n't
quite
wholesome
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
deadly
poison
,
"
was
the
settler
's
answer
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
showed
no
more
uneasiness
than
if
it
had
been
commended
to
him
as
ambrosia
;
but
he
gave
the
man
his
arm
,
and
as
they
went
along
explained
to
him
the
nature
of
their
purchase
,
and
inquired
where
it
lay
.
 
<EOS>
Close
to
his
own
log
-
house
,
he
said
;
so
close
that
he
had
used
their
dwelling
as
a
store
-
house
for
some
corn
;
they
must
excuse
it
that
night
,
but
he
would
endeavour
to
get
it
taken
out
upon
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
gave
them
to
understand
,
as
an
additional
scrap
of
local
chit
-
chat
,
that
he
had
buried
the
last
proprietor
with
his
own
hands
;
a
piece
of
information
which
Mark
also
received
without
the
least
abatement
of
his
equanimity
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
he
conducted
them
to
a
miserable
cabin
,
rudely
constructed
of
the
trunks
of
trees
;
the
door
of
which
had
either
fallen
down
or
been
carried
away
long
ago
;
and
which
was
consequently
open
to
the
wild
landscape
and
the
dark
night
.
 
<EOS>
Saving
for
the
little
store
he
had
mentioned
,
it
was
perfectly
bare
of
all
furniture
;
but
they
had
left
a
chest
upon
the
landing
-
place
,
and
he
gave
them
a
rude
torch
in
lieu
of
candle
.
 
<EOS>
This
latter
acquisition
Mark
planted
in
the
earth
,
and
then
declaring
that
the
mansion
"
looked
quite
comfortable
,
"
hurried
Martin
off
again
to
help
bring
up
the
chest
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
the
way
to
the
landing
-
place
and
back
,
Mark
talked
incessantly
;
as
if
he
would
infuse
into
his
partner
's
breast
some
faint
belief
that
they
had
arrived
under
the
most
auspicious
and
cheerful
of
all
imaginable
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
But
many
a
man
who
would
have
stood
within
a
home
dismantled
,
strong
in
his
passion
and
design
of
vengeance
,
has
had
the
firmness
of
his
nature
conquered
by
the
razing
of
an
air
-
built
castle
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
log
-
hut
received
them
for
the
second
time
,
Martin
laid
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
wept
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
love
you
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Tapley
,
in
great
terror
;
"
Do
n't
do
that
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
do
that
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Anything
but
that
!
 
<EOS>
It
never
helped
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
over
the
lowest
fence
yet
,
sir
,
and
it
never
will
.
<EOS>
Besides
its
being
of
no
use
to
you
,
it
's
worse
than
of
no
use
to
me
,
for
the
least
sound
of
it
will
knock
me
flat
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stand
up
agin
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
but
that
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
he
spoke
the
truth
,
for
the
extraordinary
alarm
with
which
he
looked
at
Martin
as
he
paused
upon
his
knees
before
the
chest
,
in
the
act
of
unlocking
it
,
to
say
these
words
,
sufficiently
confirmed
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
forgiveness
a
thousand
times
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
have
helped
it
,
if
death
had
been
the
penalty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
my
forgiveness
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mark
,
with
his
accustomed
cheerfulness
,
as
he
proceeded
to
unpack
the
chest
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
head
partner
a
-
asking
forgiveness
of
Co.
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
There
must
be
something
wrong
in
the
firm
when
that
happens
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
the
books
inspected
and
the
accounts
gone
over
immediate
.
 
<EOS>
Here
we
are
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
in
its
proper
place
.
<EOS>
Here
's
the
salt
pork
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
biscuit
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
whiskey
.
<EOS>
Uncommon
good
it
smells
too
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
tin
pot
.
 
<EOS>
This
tin
pot
's
a
small
fortun
"
in
itself
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
blankets
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
axe
.
 
<EOS>
Who
says
we
ai
n't
got
a
first
-
rate
fit
out
?
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
was
a
cadet
gone
out
to
Indy
,
and
my
noble
father
was
chairman
of
the
Board
of
Directors
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
when
I
've
got
some
water
from
the
stream
afore
the
door
and
mixed
the
grog
,
"
cried
Mark
,
running
out
to
suit
the
action
to
the
word
,
"
there
's
a
supper
ready
,
comprising
every
delicacy
of
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
Here
we
are
,
sir
,
all
complete
.
 
<EOS>
For
what
we
are
going
to
receive
,
et
cetrer
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
<EOS>
,
it
's
very
like
a
gipsy
party
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
not
to
take
heart
,
in
the
company
of
such
a
man
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
sat
upon
the
ground
beside
the
box
;
took
out
his
knife
;
and
ate
and
drank
sturdily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
see
,
"
said
Mark
,
when
they
had
made
a
hearty
meal
;
"
with
your
knife
and
mine
,
I
sticks
this
blanket
right
afore
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Or
where
,
in
a
state
of
high
civilization
,
the
door
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
And
very
neat
<EOS>
it
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
stops
the
aperture
below
,
by
putting
the
chest
agin
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
very
neat
<EOS>
THAT
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
's
your
blanket
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Then
here
's
mine
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
's
to
hinder
our
passing
a
good
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
For
all
his
light
-
hearted
speaking
,
it
was
long
before
he
slept
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrapped
his
blanket
round
him
,
put
the
axe
ready
to
his
hand
,
and
lay
across
the
threshold
of
the
door
;
too
anxious
and
too
watchful
to
close
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
novelty
of
their
dreary
situation
,
the
dread
of
some
rapacious
animal
or
human
enemy
,
the
terrible
uncertainty
of
their
means
of
subsistence
,
the
apprehension
of
death
,
the
immense
distance
and
the
hosts
of
obstacles
between
themselves
and
England
,
were
fruitful
sources
of
disquiet
in
the
deep
silence
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Though
Martin
would
have
had
him
think
<EOS>
otherwise
,
Mark
felt
that
he
was
waking
also
,
and
a
prey
to
the
same
reflections
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
almost
worse
than
all
,
for
if
he
began
to
brood
over
their
miseries
instead
of
trying
to
make
head
against
them
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
such
a
state
of
mind
would
powerfully
assist
the
influence
of
the
pestilent
climate
.
 
<EOS>
Never
had
the
light
of
day
been
half
so
welcome
to
his
eyes
,
<EOS>
as
when
awaking
from
a
fitful
doze
,
Mark
saw
it
shining
through
the
blanket
in
the
doorway
.
   
<EOS>
He
stole
out
gently
,
for
his
companion
was
sleeping
now
;
and
having
refreshed
himself
by
washing
in
the
river
,
where
it
snowed
before
the
door
,
took
a
rough
survey
of
the
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
not
above
a
score
of
cabins
in
the
whole
;
half
of
these
appeared
untenanted
;
all
were
rotten
and
decayed
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
tottering
,
abject
,
and
forlorn
among
them
was
called
,
with
great
propriety
,
the
Bank
,
and
National
Credit
Office
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
some
feeble
props
about
it
,
but
was
settling
deep
down
in
the
mud
,
past
all
recovery
.
   
<EOS>
Here
and
there
an
effort
had
been
made
to
clear
the
land
,
and
something
like
a
field
had
been
marked
out
,
where
,
among
the
stumps
and
ashes
of
burnt
trees
,
a
scanty
crop
of
Indian
corn
was
growing
.
<EOS>
In
some
quarters
,
a
snake
or
zigzag
fence
had
been
begun
,
but
in
no
instance
had
it
been
completed
;
and
the
felled
logs
,
half
hidden
in
the
soil
,
lay
mouldering
away
.
 
<EOS>
Three
or
four
meagre
dogs
,
wasted
and
vexed
with
hunger
;
some
long
-
legged
pigs
,
wandering
away
into
the
woods
in
search
of
food
;
some
children
,
nearly
naked
,
gazing
at
him
from
the
huts
;
were
all
the
living
things
he
saw
.
 
<EOS>
A
fetid
vapour
,
hot
and
sickening
as
the
breath
of
an
oven
,
rose
up
from
the
earth
,
and
hung
on
everything
around
;
and
as
his
foot
-
prints
sunk
into
the
marshy
ground
,
a
black
ooze
started
forth
to
blot
them
out
.
   
<EOS>
Their
own
land
was
mere
forest
.
 
<EOS>
The
trees
had
grown
so
think
and
close
that
they
shouldered
one
another
out
of
their
places
,
and
the
weakest
,
forced
into
shapes
of
strange
distortion
,
languished
like
cripples
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
were
stunted
,
from
the
pressure
and
the
want
of
room
;
and
high
about
the
stems
of
all
grew
long
rank
grass
,
dank
weeds
,
and
frowsy
underwood
;
not
divisible
into
their
separate
kinds
,
but
tangled
all
together
in
a
heap
;
a
jungle
deep
and
dark
,
with
neither
earth
nor
water
at
its
roots
,
but
putrid
matter
,
formed
of
the
pulpy
offal
of
the
two
,
and
of
their
own
corruption
.
   
<EOS>
He
went
down
to
the
landing
-
place
where
they
had
left
their
goods
last
night
;
and
there
he
found
some
half
-
dozen
men
---
wan
and
forlorn
to
look
at
,
but
ready
enough
to
assist
---
who
helped
him
to
carry
them
to
the
log
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
They
shook
their
heads
in
speaking
of
the
settlement
,
and
had
no
comfort
to
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
had
the
means
of
going
away
had
all
deserted
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
who
were
left
had
lost
their
wives
,
their
children
,
friends
,
or
brothers
there
,
and
suffered
much
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
them
were
ill
then
;
none
were
the
men
they
had
been
once
.
 
<EOS>
They
frankly
offered
their
assistance
and
advice
,
and
,
leaving
him
for
that
time
,
went
sadly
off
upon
their
several
tasks
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
was
by
this
time
stirring
;
but
he
had
greatly
changed
,
even
in
one
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
pale
and
languid
;
he
spoke
of
pains
and
weakness
in
his
limbs
,
and
complained
that
his
sight
was
dim
,
and
his
voice
feeble
.
 
<EOS>
Increasing
in
his
own
briskness
as
the
prospect
grew
more
and
more
dismal
,
Mark
brought
away
a
door
from
one
of
the
deserted
houses
,
and
fitted
it
to
their
own
habitation
;
then
went
back
again
for
a
rude
bench
he
had
observed
,
with
which
he
presently
returned
in
triumph
;
and
having
put
this
piece
of
furniture
outside
the
house
,
arranged
the
notable
tin
pot
and
other
such
movables
upon
it
,
that
it
might
represent
a
dresser
or
a
sideboard
.
 
<EOS>
Greatly
satisfied
with
this
arrangement
,
he
next
rolled
their
cask
of
flour
into
the
house
and
set
it
up
on
end
in
one
corner
,
where
it
served
for
a
side
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
No
better
dining
-
table
could
be
required
than
the
chest
,
which
he
solemnly
devoted
to
that
useful
service
thenceforth
.
<EOS>
Their
blankets
,
clothes
,
and
the
like
<EOS>
,
he
hung
on
pegs
and
nails
.
<EOS>
And
lastly
,
he
brought
forth
a
great
placard
(
which
Martin
in
the
exultation
of
his
heart
had
prepared
with
his
own
hands
at
the
National
Hotel
)
bearing
the
inscription
,
CHUZZLEWIT
&
CO
.
,
ARCHITECTS
AND
SURVEYORS
,
which
he
displayed
upon
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
premises
,
with
as
much
gravity
as
if
the
thriving
city
of
Eden
had
a
real
existence
,
and
they
expected
to
be
overwhelmed
with
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
These
here
tools
,
"
said
Mark
,
bringing
forward
Martin
's
case
of
instruments
and
sticking
the
compasses
upright
in
a
stump
before
the
door
,
"
shall
be
set
out
in
the
open
air
to
show
that
we
come
provided
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
if
any
gentleman
wants
a
house
built
,
he
'd
better
give
his
orders
<EOS>
,
afore
we
're
other
ways
bespoke
.
"
   
<EOS>
Considering
the
intense
heat
of
the
weather
,
this
was
not
a
bad
morning
's
work
;
but
without
pausing
for
a
moment
,
though
he
was
streaming
at
every
pore
,
Mark
vanished
into
the
house
again
,
and
presently
reappeared
with
a
hatchet
;
intent
on
performing
some
impossibilities
with
that
implement
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
ugly
old
tree
in
the
way
,
sir
,
"
he
observed
,
"
which'll
be
all
the
better
down
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
build
the
oven
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
handy
spot
for
clay
as
Eden
is
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
convenient
,
anyhow
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
Martin
gave
him
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
sat
the
whole
time
with
his
head
upon
his
hands
,
gazing
at
the
current
as
it
rolled
swiftly
by
;
thinking
,
perhaps
,
how
fast
it
moved
towards
the
open
sea
,
the
high
road
to
the
home
he
never
would
behold
again
.
   
<EOS>
Not
even
the
vigorous
strokes
which
Mark
dealt
at
the
tree
awoke
him
from
his
mournful
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
all
his
endeavours
to
rouse
him
of
no
use
,
Mark
stopped
in
his
work
and
came
towards
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
give
in
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mark
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
"
what
have
I
done
in
all
my
life
that
has
deserved
this
heavy
fate
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
,
"
for
the
matter
of
that
<EOS>
,
everybody
as
is
here
might
say
the
same
thing
;
many
of
'em
with
better
reason
p'raps
than
you
or
me
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
up
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Do
something
.
 
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
ease
your
mind
,
now
,
do
n't
you
think
,
by
making
some
personal
obserwations
in
a
letter
to
Scadder
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Martin
,
shaking
his
head
sorrowfully
:
"
I
am
past
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
're
past
that
already
,
"
returned
Mark
,
"
you
must
be
ill
,
and
ought
to
be
attended
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
me
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
the
best
you
can
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
'll
soon
have
only
yourself
to
consider
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
God
speed
you
home
,
and
forgive
me
for
bringing
you
here
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
destined
to
die
in
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
it
<EOS>
the
instant
I
set
foot
upon
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Sleeping
or
waking
,
Mark
,
I
dreamed
it
all
last
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
you
must
be
ill
,
"
returned
Mark
,
tenderly
,
"
and
now
I
'm
sure
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
touch
of
fever
and
ague
caught
on
these
rivers
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
but
bless
you
,
THAT
'S
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
a
seasoning
,
and
we
must
all
be
seasoned
,
one
way
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
religion
that
is
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
He
only
sighed
and
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wait
half
a
minute
,
"
said
Mark
cheerily
,
"
till
I
run
up
to
one
of
our
neighbours
and
ask
what
's
best
to
be
took
,
and
borrow
a
little
of
it
to
give
you
;
and
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
you
'll
find
yourself
as
strong
as
ever
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
gone
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
give
in
while
I
'm
away
,
whatever
you
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
Throwing
down
his
hatchet
,
he
sped
away
immediately
,
but
stopped
when
he
had
got
a
little
distance
,
and
looked
back
;
then
hurried
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Tapley
,
"
said
Mark
,
giving
himself
a
tremendous
blow
in
the
chest
by
way
of
reviver
,
"
just
you
attend
to
what
I
've
got
to
say

Things

And

Now

he
could

make
up
his
mind
,
in
his
great
agitation
,
whether
to
call
Tom
his
dear
friend
or
a

so
he
shook
his
fist
at
him
PRO

cried

departing

in

on

<EOS>
Then
Mr
Pecksniff
,
gently
warbling
a
rustic
stave
,
put
on
his
garden
hat
,
seized
a
spade
,
and
opened
the
street
door
;
calmly
appearing
on
the
threshold
,
as
if
he
thought
he
had
,
from
his
vineyard
,
heard
a
modest
rap
,
but
was
not
quite
certain

<EOS>
Seeing
a

before

he
started
back
in
as
much
confusion
as
a
good

with
a
crystal
conscience
might
betray
in
mere
surprise

<EOS>
Recognition
came
upon
him
the

cried

here
he
pointed
to

shook
his

as
if

were
not

without

He
had
by
this
time
got
them
into
the
best
parlour
,
where
the
portrait
by
Spiller
,
and
the
bust
by
Spoker
,
were
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
daughters
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
will
be
overjoyed
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
feel
weary
upon
such
a
theme
,
I
should
have
been
worn
out
long
ago
,
my
dear
sir
,
by
their
constant
anticipation
of
this
happiness
and
their
repeated
allusions
to
our
meeting
at
Mrs
Todgers
's
.
 
<EOS>
Their
fair
young
friend
,
too
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
whom
they
so
desire
to
know
and
love
---
indeed
to
know
her
,
is
to
love
---
<EOS>
I
hope
I
see
her
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
in
saying
,
"
Welcome
to
my
humble
roof
!
<EOS>
"
I
find
some
echo
in
her
own
sentiments
.
 
<EOS>
If
features
are
an
index
to
the
heart
,
I
have
no
fears
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
An
extremely
engaging
expression
of
countenance
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
my
dear
sir
---
very
much
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
flatters
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
flattery
from
him
is
worth
the
having
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
a
dealer
in
it
,
and
it
comes
from
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
We
thought
Mr
---
"
   
"
Pinch
,
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pinch
would
have
arrived
before
us
,
Pecksniff
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
did
arrive
before
you
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
retorted
Pecksniff
,
raising
his
voice
for
the
edification
of
Tom
upon
the
stairs
,
"
and
was
about
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
to
tell
me
of
your
coming
,
when
I
begged
him
first
to
knock
at
my
daughters
'
chamber
,
and
inquire
after
Charity
,
my
dear
child
,
who
is
not
so
well
as
I
could
wish
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
answering
their
looks
,
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
she
is
not
.
<EOS>
It
is
merely
an
hysterical
affection
;
nothing
more
,
I
am
not
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
!
 
Thomas
!
"
exclaimed
Pecksniff
,
in
his
kindest
accents
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
make
no
stranger
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
is
a
friend
of
mine
,
of
rather
long
-
standing
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
you
must
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
introduce
me
very
kindly
,
and
speak
of
me
in
terms
of
which
I
am
very
proud
"
   
"
Old
Thomas
!
"
cried
his
master
,
pleasantly
"
God
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
reported
that
the
young
ladies
would
appear
directly
,
and
that
the
best
refreshments
which
the
house
afforded
were
even
then
in
preparation
,
under
their
joint
superintendence
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
speaking
,
the
old
man
looked
at
him
intently
,
though
with
less
harshness
than
was
common
to
him
;
nor
did
the
mutual
embarrassment
of
Tom
and
the
young
lady
,
to
whatever
cause
he
attributed
it
,
seem
to
escape
his
observation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pecksniff
,
"
he
said
after
a
pause
,
rising
and
taking
him
aside
towards
the
window
,
"
I
was
much
shocked
on
hearing
of
my
brother
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
been
strangers
for
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
My
only
comfort
is
that
he
must
have
lived
the
happier
and
better
man
for
having
associated
no
hopes
or
schemes
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Peace
to
his
memory
!
 
<EOS>
We
were
play
-
fellows
once
;
and
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
both
if
we
had
died
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
Finding
him
in
this
gentle
mood
,
Mr
Pecksniff
began
to
see
another
way
out
of
his
difficulties
,
besides
the
casting
overboard
of
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
any
man
,
my
dear
sir
,
could
possibly
be
the
happier
for
not
knowing
you
<EOS>
,
"
he
returned
,
"
you
will
excuse
my
doubting
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
Mr
Anthony
,
in
the
evening
of
his
life
,
was
happier
in
the
affection
of
his
excellent
son
---
a
pattern
,
my
dear
sir
,
a
pattern
to
all
sons
 
---
and
in
the
care
of
a
distant
relation
who
,
however
lowly
in
his
means
of
serving
him
,
had
no
bounds
to
his
inclination
;
I
can
inform
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
's
this
?
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
a
legatee
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
melancholy
pressure
of
his
hand
,
"
quite
understand
my
nature
yet
,
I
find
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
I
am
not
a
legatee
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
proud
to
say
I
am
not
a
legatee
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
proud
to
say
that
neither
of
my
children
is
a
legatee
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
sir
,
I
was
with
him
at
his
own
request
.
 
<EOS>
HE
understood
me
somewhat
better
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrote
and
said
,
"
I
am
sick
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sinking
.
 
<EOS>
Come
to
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
beside
his
bed
,
sir
,
and
I
stood
beside
his
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
at
the
risk
of
offending
even
you
,
I
did
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
avowal
should
lead
to
our
instant
separation
,
and
to
the
severing
of
those
tender
ties
between
us
which
have
recently
been
formed
,
I
make
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
a
legatee
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
smiling
dispassionately
;
"
and
I
never
expected
to
be
a
legatee
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
better
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
son
a
pattern
!
"
cried
old
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
tell
me
that
?
<EOS>
My
brother
had
in
his
wealth
the
usual
doom
of
wealth
,
and
root
of
misery
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
his
corrupting
influence
with
him
,
go
where
he
would
;
and
shed
it
round
him
,
even
on
his
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
of
his
own
child
a
greedy
expectant
,
who
measured
every
day
and
hour
the
lessening
distance
between
his
father
and
the
grave
,
and
cursed
his
tardy
progress
on
that
dismal
road
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
boldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
saw
that
shadow
in
his
house
,
"
said
Martin
Chuzzlewit
,
"
the
last
time
we
met
,
and
warned
him
of
its
presence
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
<EOS>
when
I
see
it
,
do
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
lived
within
it
all
these
years
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
deny
it
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
answered
,
warmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
deny
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
That
bereaved
young
man
is
now
in
this
house
,
sir
,
seeking
in
change
of
scene
the
peace
of
mind
he
has
lost
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
be
backward
in
doing
justice
to
that
young
man
,
when
even
undertakers
and
coffin
-
makers
have
been
moved
by
the
conduct
he
has
exhibited
;
when
even
mutes
have
spoken
in
his
praise
,
and
the
medical
man
has
n't
known
what
to
do
with
himself
in
the
excitement
of
his
feelings
!
<EOS>
There
is
a
person
of
the
name
of
Gamp
,
sir
---
Mrs
Gamp
---
ask
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
Mr
Jonas
in
a
trying
time
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
HER
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
respectable
,
but
not
sentimental
,
and
will
state
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
A
line
addressed
to
Mrs
Gamp
,
at
the
BirdShop
,
Kingsgate
Street
,
High
Holborn
,
London
,
will
meet
with
every
attention
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
be
examined
,
my
good
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Strike
,
but
hear
!
 
<EOS>
Leap
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
but
look
!
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
taking
both
his
hands
,
"
if
I
am
warm
;
but
I
am
honest
,
and
must
state
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
In
proof
of
the
character
he
gave
himself
,
Mr
Pecksniff
suffered
tears
of
honesty
to
ooze
out
of
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
gazed
at
him
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
wonder
,
repeating
to
himself
,
"
Here
now
!
 
<EOS>
In
this
house
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
mastered
his
surprise
,
and
said
,
after
a
pause
:
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
friendly
spirit
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
,
sir
<EOS>
but
he
is
in
the
receipt
of
my
humble
hospitality
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
"
replied
the
old
man
,
"
let
me
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
were
disposed
to
regard
him
in
any
other
than
a
friendly
spirit
,
I
should
have
said
keep
us
apart
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
frankness
itself
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
break
this
happiness
to
him
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
he
left
the
room
,
"
if
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
minute
---
gently
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
paved
the
way
to
the
disclosure
so
very
gently
,
<EOS>
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
he
returned
with
Mr
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
young
ladies
had
made
their
appearance
,
and
the
table
had
been
set
out
for
the
refreshment
of
the
travellers
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
however
well
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
his
morality
,
had
taught
Jonas
the
lesson
of
dutiful
behaviour
to
his
uncle
,
and
however
perfectly
Jonas
,
in
the
cunning
of
his
nature
,
had
learnt
it
,
that
young
man
's
bearing
,
when
presented
to
his
father
's
brother
,
was
anything
but
manly
or
engaging
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
so
singular
a
mixture
of
defiance
and
obsequiousness
,
of
fear
and
hardihood
,
of
dogged
sullenness
and
an
attempt
at
enraging
and
propitiation
,
never
was
expressed
in
any
one
human
figure
as
in
that
of
Jonas
<EOS>
,
when
,
having
raised
his
downcast
eyes
to
Martin
's
face
,
he
let
them
fall
again
,
and
uneasily
closing
and
unclosing
his
hands
without
a
moment
's
intermission
,
stood
swinging
himself
from
side
to
side
,
waiting
to
be
addressed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nephew
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
a
dutiful
son
,
I
hear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
dutiful
as
sons
in
general
,
I
suppose
,
"
returned
Jonas
,
looking
up
and
down
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
brag
to
have
been
any
better
than
other
sons
;
but
I
have
n't
been
any
worse
,
I
dare
say
.
"
   
"
A
pattern
to
all
sons
,
I
am
told
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
glancing
towards
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
"
said
Jonas
,
looking
up
again
for
a
moment
,
and
shaking
his
head
,
"
I
've
been
as
good
a
son
as
ever
<EOS>
you
were
a
brother
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
pot
and
the
kettle
,
if
you
come
to
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
speak
bitterly
,
in
the
violence
of
your
regret
,
"
said
Martin
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
hand
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
did
so
,
and
was
almost
at
his
ease
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pecksniff
,
"
he
whispered
,
as
they
drew
their
chairs
about
the
table
;
"
I
gave
him
as
good
as
he
brought
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
better
look
at
home
,
before
he
looks
out
of
window
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
only
answered
by
a
nudge
of
the
elbow
,
which
might
either
be
construed
into
an
indignant
remonstrance
or
a
cordial
assent
;
but
which
,
in
any
case
,
was
an
emphatic
admonition
to
his
chosen
son
-
in
-
law
to
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
proceeded
to
do
the
honours
of
the
house
with
his
accustomed
ease
and
amiability
.
   
<EOS>
But
not
even
Mr
Pecksniff
's
guileless
merriment
could
set
such
a
party
at
their
ease
,
or
reconcile
materials
so
utterly
discordant
and
conflicting
as
those
with
which
he
had
to
deal
.
 
<EOS>
The
unspeakable
jealously
and
hatred
which
that
night
's
explanation
had
sown
in
Charity
's
breast
,
was
not
to
be
so
easily
kept
down
;
and
more
than
once
it
showed
itself
in
such
intensity
,
as
seemed
to
render
a
full
disclosure
of
all
the
circumstances
then
and
there
,
impossible
to
be
avoided
.
 
<EOS>
The
beauteous
Merry
,
too
,
with
all
the
glory
of
her
conquest
fresh
upon
her
,
so
probed
and
lanced
the
rankling
disappointment
of
her
sister
by
her
capricious
airs
and
thousand
little
trials
of
Mr
Jonas
's
obedience
,
that
she
almost
goaded
her
into
a
fit
of
madness
,
and
obliged
her
to
retire
from
table
in
a
burst
of
passion
,
hardly
less
vehement
than
that
to
which
she
had
abandoned
herself
in
the
first
tumult
of
her
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
The
constraint
imposed
upon
the
family
by
the
presence
among
them
for
the
first
time
of
Mary
Graham
(
for
by
that
name
old
Martin
Chuzzlewit
had
introduced
her
)
did
not
at
all
improve
this
state
of
things
;
gentle
and
quiet
though
her
manner
was
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
's
situation
was
peculiarly
trying
;
for
,
<EOS>
what
with
having
constantly
to
keep
the
peace
between
his
daughters
;
to
maintain
a
reasonable
show
of
affection
and
unity
in
his
household
;
to
curb
the
growing
ease
and
gaiety
of
Jonas
,
which
vented
itself
in
sundry
insolences
towards
Mr
Pinch
,
and
an
indefinable
coarseness
of
manner
in
reference
to
Mary
(
they
being
the
two
dependants
)
;
to
make
no
mention
at
all
of
his
having
perpetually
to
conciliate
his
rich
old
relative
,
and
to
smooth
down
,
or
explain
away
,
some
of
the
ten
thousand
bad
appearances
and
combinations
of
bad
appearances
,
by
which
they
were
surrounded
on
that
unlucky
evening
---
<EOS>
what
with
having
to
do
this
,
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
sum
up
how
much
more
,
without
the
least
relief
or
assistance
from
anybody
,
it
may
be
easily
imagined
that
Mr
Pecksniff
had
in
his
enjoyment
something
more
than
that
usual
portion
of
alloy
which
is
mixed
up
with
the
best
of
men
's
delights
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
never
in
his
life
felt
such
relief
as
when
old
Martin
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
announced
that
it
was
time
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
rooms
,
"
he
said
,
"
at
the
Dragon
,
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
fancy
for
the
evening
walk
.
 
<EOS>
The
nights
are
dark
just
now
;
perhaps
Mr
Pinch
would
not
object
to
light
us
home
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
!
"
cried
Pecksniff
,
"
I
shall
be
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
Merry
,
my
child
,
the
lantern
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
lantern
,
if
you
please
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Martin
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
could
n't
think
of
taking
your
father
out
of
doors
to
-
night
;
and
,
to
be
brief
,
I
wo
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
already
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
but
it
was
so
emphatically
said
that
he
paused
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
Mr
Pinch
,
or
go
alone
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Which
shall
it
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
Thomas
,
sir
,
"
cried
Pecksniff
,
"
since
you
are
so
resolute
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
,
my
friend
,
be
very
careful
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
in
some
need
of
this
injunction
,
for
he
felt
so
nervous
,
and
trembled
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
hold
the
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
more
difficult
when
,
at
the
old
man
's
bidding
she
drew
her
hand
through
his
---
Tom
Pinch
's
---
arm
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Martin
,
<EOS>
on
the
way
,
"
you
are
very
comfortably
situated
here
;
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
answered
,
with
even
more
than
his
usual
enthusiasm
,
that
he
was
under
obligations
to
Mr
Pecksniff
which
the
devotion
of
a
lifetime
would
but
imperfectly
repay
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
have
you
known
my
nephew
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
nephew
,
sir
?
"
faltered
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
,
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
"
cried
Tom
,
greatly
relieved
,
for
his
mind
was
running
upon
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
spoke
to
him
before
to
-
night
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
half
a
lifetime
will
suffice
for
the
acknowledgment
of
HIS
kindness
,
"
observed
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
felt
that
this
was
a
rebuff
for
him
,
and
could
not
but
understand
it
as
a
left
-
handed
hit
at
his
employer
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
felt
that
Mr
Pinch
was
not
remarkable
for
presence
of
mind
,
and
that
he
could
not
say
too
little
under
existing
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
So
SHE
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
disgusted
by
what
in
his
suspicious
nature
he
considered
a
shameless
and
fulsome
puff
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
which
was
a
part
of
Tom
's
hired
service
and
in
which
he
was
determined
to
persevere
,
set
him
down
at
once
for
a
deceitful
,
servile
,
miserable
fawner
.
 
<EOS>
So
HE
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
they
were
all
sufficiently
uncomfortable
,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
Martin
was
perhaps
the
most
so
;
for
he
had
felt
kindly
towards
Tom
at
first
,
and
had
been
interested
by
his
seeming
simplicity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
like
the
rest
,
"
he
thought
,
glancing
at
the
face
of
the
unconscious
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
nearly
imposed
upon
me
,
but
you
have
lost
your
labour
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
too
zealous
<EOS>
a
toad
-
eater
,
and
betray
yourself
,
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
During
the
whole
remainder
of
the
walk
,
not
another
word
was
spoken
.
<EOS>
First
among
the
meetings
to
which
Tom
had
long
looked
forward
with
a
beating
heart
,
it
was
memorable
for
nothing
but
embarrassment
and
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
They
parted
at
the
Dragon
door
;
and
sighing
as
he
extinguished
the
candle
in
the
lantern
,
Tom
turned
back
again
over
the
gloomy
fields
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
approached
the
first
stile
,
which
was
in
a
lonely
part
,
made
very
dark
by
a
plantation
of
young
firs
,
a
man
slipped
past
him
and
went
on
before
.
 
<EOS>
Coming
to
the
stile
he
stopped
,
and
took
his
seat
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
was
rather
startled
,
and
for
a
moment
stood
still
,
but
he
stepped
forward
again
immediately
,
and
went
close
up
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
Jonas
;
swinging
his
legs
to
and
fro
,
sucking
the
head
of
a
stick
,
and
looking
with
a
sneer
at
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Tom
,
"
who
would
have
thought
of
its
being
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
followed
us
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
to
you
?
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
to
the
devil
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
very
civil
,
I
think
,
"
remarked
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Civil
enough
for
YOU
,
"
retorted
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
who
has
as
good
a
right
to
common
consideration
as
another
,
"
said
Tom
mildly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
liar
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
a
right
to
any
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
n't
a
right
to
anything
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
pretty
sort
of
fellow
to
talk
about
your
rights
,
upon
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
---
 
Rights
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
proceed
in
this
way
,
"
returned
Tom
,
reddening
,
"
you
will
oblige
me
to
talk
about
my
wrongs
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
your
joke
is
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
way
with
you
curs
,
"
said
Mr
Jonas
,
"
that
when
you
know
a
man
's
in
real
earnest
,
you
pretend
to
think
he
's
joking
,
so
that
you
may
turn
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
wo
n't
do
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
too
stale
.
 
<EOS>
Now
just
attend
to
me
for
a
bit
,
Mr
Pitch
,
or
Witch
,
or
Stitch
,
or
whatever
your
name
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Pinch
,
"
observed
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
call
me
by
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
n't
even
be
called
out
of
your
name
,
must
n't
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pauper
"
prentices
are
looking
up
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Ecod
,
we
manage
'em
a
little
better
in
the
city
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
what
you
do
in
the
city
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
this
,
Mister
Pinch
,
"
retorted
Jonas
,
thrusting
his
face
so
close
to
Tom
's
that
Tom
was
obliged
to
retreat
a
step
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
to
keep
your
own
counsel
,
and
to
avoid
title
-
tattle
,
and
not
to
cut
in
where
you
're
not
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
heard
something
of
you
,
my
friend
,
and
your
meek
ways
;
and
I
recommend
you
to
forget
'em
till
I
am
married
to
one
of
Pecksniff
's
gals
,
and
not
to
curry
favour
among
my
relations
,
but
to
leave
the
course
clear
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
when
curs
wo
n't
leave
the
course
clear
,
they
're
whipped
off
;
so
this
is
kind
advice
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
Damme
,
who
are
you
,
"
cried
Jonas
,
with
increased
contempt
,
"
that
you
should
walk
home
with
THEM
,
unless
it
was
behind
'em
,
like
any
other
servant
out
of
livery
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
"
<EOS>
I
see
that
you
had
better
get
off
the
stile
,
and
let
me
pursue
my
way
home
.
 
<EOS>
Make
room
for
me
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
Jonas
,
spreading
out
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
till
I
choose
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
choose
now
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
afraid
of
my
making
you
split
upon
some
of
your
babbling
just
now
,
are
you
,
Sneak
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afraid
of
many
things
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
and
certainly
not
of
anything
that
you
will
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
tale
-
bearer
,
and
I
despise
all
meanness
.
 
<EOS>
You
quite
mistake
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Tom
,
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
manly
from
one
in
your
position
to
one
in
mine
?
 
<EOS>
Please
to
make
room
for
me
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
The
less
I
say
,
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
less
you
say
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Jonas
,
dangling
his
legs
the
more
,
and
taking
no
heed
of
this
request
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
very
little
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Ecod
,
I
should
like
to
know
what
goes
on
between
you
and
a
vagabond
member
of
my
family
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
very
little
in
that
too
,
I
dare
say
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
vagabond
member
of
your
family
,
"
cried
Tom
,
stoutly
,
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
!
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
's
namesake
,
if
you
mean
him
,
is
no
vagabond
.
 
<EOS>
Any
comparison
between
you
and
him
"
---
Tom
snapped
his
fingers
at
him
,
for
he
was
rising
fast
in
wrath
---
"
is
immeasurably
to
your
disadvantage
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
indeed
!
"
sneered
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
think
of
his
deary
---
 
<EOS>
his
beggarly
leavings
,
eh
,
Mister
Pinch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
another
word
,
or
stay
here
another
instant
,
"
replied
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
told
you
before
,
you
're
a
liar
,
"
said
Jonas
,
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
stay
here
till
I
give
you
leave
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
keep
where
you
are
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
flourished
his
stick
over
Tom
's
head
;
but
in
a
moment
it
was
spinning
harmlessly
in
the
air
,
and
Jonas
himself
lay
sprawling
in
the
ditch
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
momentary
struggle
for
the
stick
,
Tom
had
brought
it
into
violent
contact
with
his
opponent
's
forehead
;
and
the
blood
welled
out
profusely
from
a
deep
cut
on
the
temple
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
was
first
apprised
of
this
by
seeing
that
he
pressed
his
handkerchief
to
the
wounded
part
,
and
staggered
as
he
rose
,
being
stunned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
hurt
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
Lean
on
me
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
do
that
without
forgiving
me
,
if
you
still
bear
me
malice
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
know
why
;
for
I
never
offended
you
before
we
met
on
this
spot
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
made
him
no
answer
;
not
appearing
at
first
to
understand
him
,
or
even
to
know
that
he
was
hurt
,
though
he
several
times
took
his
handkerchief
from
the
cut
to
look
vacantly
at
the
blood
upon
it
.
<EOS>
After
one
of
these
examinations
,
he
looked
at
Tom
,
and
then
there
was
an
expression
in
his
features
,
which
showed
that
he
understood
what
had
taken
place
,
and
would
remember
it
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
more
passed
between
them
as
they
went
home
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
kept
a
little
in
advance
,
and
Tom
Pinch
sadly
followed
,
thinking
of
the
grief
which
the
knowledge
of
this
quarrel
must
occasion
his
excellent
benefactor
.
 
<EOS>
When
Jonas
knocked
at
the
door
,
Tom
's
heart
beat
high
;
higher
when
Miss
Mercy
answered
it
,
and
seeing
her
wounded
lover
,
shireked
aloud
;
higher
,
when
he
followed
them
into
the
family
parlour
;
higher
than
at
any
other
time
,
when
Jonas
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
make
a
noise
about
it
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
worth
mentioning
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
the
road
;
the
night
's
very
dark
;
and
just
as
I
came
up
with
Mr
Pinch
"
---
he
turned
his
face
towards
Tom
,
but
not
his
eyes
---
"
<EOS>
I
ran
against
a
tree
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
skin
deep
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cold
water
,
Merry

my
child

"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Brown

Bless

<EOS>
"
Oh

bother
YOUR
nonsense

"
returned
the
gracious
son
-
in
-
law
elect
.
<EOS>
"
Be
of
some
use
if
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
ca

get
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
,
though
called
upon
to
lend
her
aid
,
sat
upright
in
one
corner
,
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
,
and
did
n't
move
a
finger
.
<EOS>
Though
Mercy
laved
the
wound
herself
;
and
Mr
Pecksniff
held
the
patient
's
head
between
his
two
hands
,
as
if
without
that
assistance
it
must
inevitably
come
in
half
;
and
Tom
Pinch
,
in
his
guilty
agitation
,
shook
a
bottle
of
Dutch
Drops
until
they
were
nothing
but
English
Froth
,
and
in
his
other
hand
sustained
a
formidable
carving
-
knife
,
really
intended
to
reduce
the
swelling
,
but
apparently
designed
for
the
ruthless
infliction
of
another
wound
as
soon
as
that
was
dressed
;
Charity
rendered
not
the
least
assistance
,
nor
uttered
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
Mr
Jonas
's
head
was
bound
up
,
and
he
had
gone
to
bed
,
and
everybody
else
had
retired
,
and
the
house
was
quiet
,
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
as
he
sat
mournfully
on
his
bedstead
,
ruminating
,
heard
a
gentle
tap
at
his
door
;
and
opening
it
,
saw
her
,
to
his
great
astonishment
,
standing
before
him
with
her
finger
on
her
lip
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pinch
,
"
she
whispered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mr
Pinch
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
truth
!
<EOS>
You
did
that
?
 
<EOS>
There
was
some
quarrel
between
you
,
and
you
struck
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
spoken
kindly
to
Tom
,
in
all
the
many
years
they
had
passed
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
stupefied
with
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
it
so
,
or
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
eagerly
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
very
much
provoked
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
it
was
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Charity
,
with
sparkling
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
-
yes
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
struggle
for
the
path
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
n't
mean
to
hurt
him
so
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
so
much
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
,
clenching
her
hand
and
stamping
her
foot
,
to
Tom
's
great
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
brave
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
honour
you
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
ever
quarrel
again
,
do
n't
spare
him
for
the
world
,
but
beat
him
down
and
set
your
shoe
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
of
this
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Pinch
,
I
am
your
friend
from
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
always
your
friend
from
this
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
turned
her
flushed
face
upon
Tom
to
confirm
her
words
by
its
kindling
expression
;
and
seizing
his
right
hand
,
pressed
it
to
her
breast
,
and
kissed
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
was
nothing
personal
in
this
to
render
it
at
all
embarrassing
,
for
even
Tom
,
whose
power
of
observation
was
by
no
means
remarkable
,
knew
from
the
energy
with
which
she
did
it
that
she
would
have
fondled
any
hand
,
no
matter
how
bedaubed
or
dyed
,
that
had
broken
the
head
of
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
went
into
his
room
,
and
went
to
bed
,
full
of
uncomfortable
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
That
there
should
be
any
such
tremendous
division
in
the
family
as
he
knew
must
have
taken
place
to
convert
Charity
Pecksniff
into
his
friend
,
for
any
reason
,
but
,
above
all
,
for
that
which
was
clearly
the
real
one
;
that
Jonas
,
who
had
assailed
him
with
such
exceeding
coarseness
,
should
have
been
sufficiently
magnanimous
to
keep
the
secret
of
their
quarrel
;
and
that
any
train
of
circumstances
should
have
led
to
the
commission
of
an
assault
and
battery
by
Thomas
Pinch
upon
any
man
calling
himself
the
friend
of
Seth
Pecksniff
;
were
matters
of
such
deep
and
painful
cogitation
that
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
violence
,
in
particular
,
so
preyed
upon
the
generous
mind
of
Tom
,
that
coupling
it
with
the
many
former
occasions
on
which
he
had
given
Mr
Pecksniff
pain
and
anxiety
(
occasions
of
which
that
gentleman
often
reminded
him
)
,
he
really
began
to
regard
himself
as
destined
by
a
mysterious
fate
to
be
the
evil
genius
and
bad
angel
of
his
patron
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
fell
asleep
at
last
,
and
dreamed
---
new
source
of
waking
uneasiness
---
that
he
had
betrayed
his
trust
,
and
run
away
with
Mary
Graham
.
   
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledged
that
,
asleep
or
awake
,
Tom
's
position
in
reference
to
this
young
lady
was
full
of
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
he
saw
of
her
,
the
more
he
admired
her
beauty
,
her
intelligence
,
the
amiable
qualities
that
even
won
on
the
divided
house
of
Pecksniff
,
and
in
a
few
days
restored
,
at
all
events
,
the
semblance
of
harmony
and
kindness
between
the
angry
sisters
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
spoke
,
Tom
held
his
breath
,
so
eagerly
he
listened
;
when
she
sang
,
he
sat
like
one
entranced
.
 
<EOS>
She
touched
his
organ
,
and
from
that
bright
epoch
even
it
,
the
old
companion
of
his
happiest
hours
,
incapable
as
he
had
thought
of
elevation
,
began
a
new
and
deified
existence
.
   
<EOS>
God
's
love
upon
thy
patience
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
Who
,
that
had
beheld
thee
,
for
three
summer
weeks
,
poring
through
half
the
deadlong
night
over
the
jingling
anatomy
of
that
inscrutable
old
harpsichord
in
the
back
parlour
,
could
have
missed
the
entrance
to
thy
secret
heart
:
albeit
it
was
dimly
known
to
thee
?
 
<EOS>
Who
that
had
seen
the
glow
upon
thy
cheek
when
leaning
down
to
listen
,
after
hours
of
labour
,
for
the
sound
of
one
incorrigible
note
,
thou
foundest
that
it
had
a
voice
at
last
,
and
wheezed
out
a
flat
something
,
distantly
akin
to
what
it
ought
to
be
,
would
not
have
known
that
it
was
destined
for
no
common
touch
,
but
one
that
smote
,
though
gently
as
an
angel
's
hand
,
upon
the
deepest
chord
within
thee
!
 
<EOS>
And
if
a
friendly
glance
---
aye
,
even
though
it
were
as
guileless
as
thine
own
,
Dear
Tom
---
could
have
but
pierced
the
twilight
of
that
evening
,
when
,
in
a
voice
well
tempered
to
the
time
,
sad
,
sweet
,
and
low
,
yet
hopeful
,
she
first
sang
to
the
altered
instrument
,
and
wondered
at
the
change
;
and
thou
,
sitting
apart
at
the
open
window
,
kept
a
glad
silence
and
a
swelling
heart
---
 
<EOS>
must
not
that
glance
have
read
perforce
the
dawning
of
a
story
,
Tom
,
that
it
were
well
for
thee
had
never
been
begun
!
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
's
situation
was
not
made
the
less
dangerous
or
difficult
by
the
fact
of
no
one
word
passing
between
them
in
reference
to
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
Honourably
mindful
of
his
promise
,
Tom
gave
her
opportunities
of
all
kinds
.
 
<EOS>
Early
and
late
he
was
in
the
church
;
in
her
favourite
walks
;
in
the
village
,
in
the
garden
,
in
the
meadows
;
and
in
any
or
all
of
these
places
he
might
have
spoken
freely
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
;
at
all
such
times
she
carefully
avoided
him
,
or
never
came
in
his
way
unaccompanied
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
that
she
disliked
or
distrusted
him
,
for
by
a
thousand
little
delicate
means
,
too
slight
for
any
notice
but
<EOS>
his
own
,
she
singled
him
out
when
others
were
present
,
and
showed
herself
the
very
soul
of
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
she
had
broken
with
Martin
,
or
had
never
returned
his
affection
,
save
in
his
own
bold
and
heightened
fancy
?
 
<EOS>
Tom
's
cheek
grew
red
with
self
-
reproach
as
he
dismissed
the
thought
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
old
Martin
came
and
went
in
his
own
strange
manner
,
or
sat
among
the
rest
absorbed
within
himself
,
and
holding
little
intercourse
with
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Although
he
was
unsocial
,
he
was
not
willful
in
other
things
,
or
troublesome
,
or
morose
;
being
never
better
pleased
than
when
they
left
him
quite
unnoticed
at
his
book
,
and
pursued
their
own
amusements
in
his
presence
,
unreserved
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
discern
in
whom
he
took
an
interest
,
or
whether
he
had
an
interest
in
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Unless
they
spoke
to
him
directly
,
he
never
showed
that
he
had
ears
or
eyes
for
anything
that
passed
.
   
<EOS>
One
day
the
lively
Merry
,
sitting
with
downcast
eyes
under
a
shady
tree
in
the
churchyard
,
whither
she
had
retired
after
fatiguing
herself
by
the
imposition
of
sundry
trials
on
the
temper
of
Mr
Jonas
,
felt
that
a
new
shadow
came
between
her
and
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
Raising
her
eyes
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
her
betrothed
,
she
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
old
Martin
instead
.
 
<EOS>
Her
surprise
was
not
diminished
when
he
took
his
seat
upon
the
turf
beside
her
,
and
opened
a
conversation
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
When
are
you
to
be
married
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
my
goodness
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Not
yet
awhile
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
hope
?
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
very
gravely
said
,
but
she
took
it
for
banter
,
and
giggled
excessively
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
old
man
,
with
unusual
kindness
,
"
you
are
young
,
good
-
looking
,
and
I
think
good
-
natured
!
 
<EOS>
Frivolous
you
are
,
and
love
to
be
,
undoubtedly
;
but
you
must
have
some
heart
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
given
it
all
away
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
Merry
,
nodding
her
head
shrewdly
,
and
plucking
up
the
grass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
parted
with
any
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
threw
the
grass
about
,
and
looked
another
way
,
but
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
repeated
his
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
my
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
!
<EOS>
really
you
must
excuse
me
!
 
<EOS>
How
very
odd
you
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
odd
in
me
to
desire
to
know
whether
you
love
the
young
man
whom
I
understand
you
are
to
marry
,
I
AM
very
odd
,
"
said
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
For
that
is
certainly
my
wish
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
such
a
monster
,
you
know
,
"
said
Merry
,
pouting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
do
n't
love
him
?
"
returned
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
meaning
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
I
'm
sure
I
tell
him
a
hundred
times
a
day
that
I
hate
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
have
heard
me
tell
him
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Often
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
I
do
,
"
cried
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
positively
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Being
at
the
same
time
engaged
to
marry
him
,
"
observed
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
"
said
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
told
the
wretch
---
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
I
told
him
when
he
asked
me
---
that
if
I
ever
did
marry
him
,
it
should
only
be
that
I
might
hate
and
tease
him
all
my
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
a
suspicion
that
the
old
man
regarded
Jonas
with
anything
but
favour
,
and
intended
these
remarks
to
be
extremely
captivating
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
appear
,
however
,
to
regard
them
in
that
light
by
any
means
;
for
when
he
spoke
again
,
it
was
in
a
tone
of
severity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
about
you
,
"
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
graves
;
"
and
remember
that
from
your
bridal
hour
to
the
day
which
sees
you
brought
as
low
as
these
,
and
laid
in
such
a
bed
,
there
will
be
no
appeal
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
Think
,
and
speak
,
and
act
,
for
once
,
like
an
accountable
creature
.
 
<EOS>
Is
any
control
put
upon
your
inclinations
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
forced
into
this
match
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
insidiously
advised
or
tempted
to
contract
it
,
by
any
one
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
ask
by
whom
;
by
any
one
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Merry
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
know
that
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
Are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nobody
ever
said
anything
to
me
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
one
had
tried
to
make
me
have
him
,
I
would
n't
have
had
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
told
that
he
was
at
first
supposed
to
be
your
sister
's
admirer
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
good
gracious
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
it
would
be
very
hard
to
make
him
,
though
he
IS
a
monster
,
accountable
for
other
people
's
vanity
,
"
said
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
poor
dear
Cherry
is
the
vainest
darling
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
her
mistake
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
was
,
"
cried
Merry
;
"
but
,
all
along
,
the
dear
child
has
been
so
dreadfully
jealous
,
and
SO
cross
,
that
,
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
it
's
impossible
to
please
her
,
and
it
's
of
no
use
trying
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
forced
,
persuaded
,
or
controlled
,
"
said
Martin
,
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
And
that
's
true
,
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
one
chance
yet
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
lapsed
into
this
engagement
in
very
giddiness
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
the
wanton
act
of
a
light
head
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
simpered
Merry
,
"
<EOS>
as
to
light
-
headedness
,
there
never
was
such
a
feather
of
a
head
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
perfect
balloon
,
I
declare
!
 
<EOS>
You
never
DID
,
you
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
waited
quietly
till
she
had
finished
,
and
then
said
,
steadily
and
slowly
,
and
in
a
softened
voice
,
as
if
he
would
still
invite
her
confidence
:
   
"
<EOS>
Have
you
any
wish
---
or
is
there
anything
within
your
breast
that
whispers
you
may
form
the
wish
,
if
you
have
time
to
think
---
to
be
released
from
this
engagement
?
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Miss
Merry
pouted
,
and
looked
down
,
and
plucked
the
grass
,
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
n't
know
that
she
had
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
pretty
sure
she
had
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
sure
,
she
might
say
.
 
<EOS>
She
"
did
n't
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
that
your
married
life
may
perhaps
be
miserable
,
full
of
bitterness
,
and
most
unhappy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Merry
looked
down
again
;
and
now
she
tore
the
grass
up
by
the
roots
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
what
shocking
words
!
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
shall
quarrel
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
quarrel
with
any
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Married
people
always
quarrel
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
to
being
miserable
,
and
bitter
,
and
all
those
dreadful
things
,
you
know
,
why
I
could
n't
be
absolutely
that
,
unless
he
always
had
the
best
of
it
;
and
I
mean
to
have
the
best
of
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
do
now
,
"
cried
Merry
,
nodding
her
head
and
giggling
very
much
;
"
for
I
make
a
perfect
slave
of
the
creature
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
it
go
on
,
"
said
Martin
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
it
go
on
!
 
<EOS>
I
sought
to
know
your
mind
,
my
dear
,
and
you
have
shown
it
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
joy
.
<EOS>
Joy
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
looking
full
upon
her
,
and
pointing
to
the
wicket
-
gate
where
Jonas
entered
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
without
waiting
for
his
nephew
,
he
passed
out
at
another
gate
,
and
went
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
terrible
old
man
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
facetious
Merry
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
perfectly
hideous
monster
to
be
wandering
about
churchyards
in
the
broad
daylight
,
frightening
people
out
of
their
wits
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
come
here
,
Griffin
,
or
<EOS>
I
'll
go
away
directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
was
the
Griffin
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
upon
the
grass
at
her
side
,
in
spite
of
this
warning
,
and
sulkily
inquired
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
my
uncle
been
a
-
talking
about
?
"
   
"
About
you
,
"
rejoined
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
says
you
're
not
half
good
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
dare
say
!
 
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
means
to
give
you
some
present
worth
having
<EOS>
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
say
anything
that
looked
like
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
THAT
he
did
n't
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Merry
,
most
decisively
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
stingy
old
dog
<EOS>
he
is
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
   
"
Griffin
!
"
cried
Miss
Mercy
,
in
counterfeit
amazement
;
"
what
are
you
doing
,
Griffin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
giving
you
a
squeeze
,
"
said
the
discomfited
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
harm
in
that
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
great
deal
of
harm
in
it
,
if
I
do
n't
consider
it
agreeable
,
"
returned
his
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
go
along
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
make
me
so
hot
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
withdrew
his
arm
,
and
for
a
moment
looked
at
her
more
like
a
murderer
than
a
lover
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
cleared
his
brow
by
degrees
,
and
broke
silence
with
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Mel
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
you
vulgar
thing
---
<EOS>
you
low
savage
?
<EOS>
"
cried
his
fair
betrothed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
is
it
to
be
?
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
afford
to
go
on
dawdling
about
here
half
my
life
<EOS>
,
I
need
n't
tell
you
,
and
Pecksniff
says
that
father
's
being
so
lately
dead
makes
very
little
odds
;
for
we
can
be
married
as
quiet
as
we
please
down
here
,
and
my
being
lonely
is
a
good
reason
to
the
neighbours
for
taking
a
wife
home
<EOS>
so
soon
,
especially
one
that
he
knew
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
crossbones
(
my
uncle
,
I
mean
)
,
he
's
sure
not
to
put
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
,
whatever
we
settle
on
,
for
he
told
Pecksniff
only
this
morning
,
that
if
YOU
liked
it
he
'd
nothing
at
all
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Mel
,
"
said
Jonas
,
venturing
on
another
squeeze
;
"
when
shall
it
be
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
!
"
cried
Merry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
,
if
you
like
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
to
next
week
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
next
week
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
said
next
quarter
,
I
should
have
wondered
at
your
impudence
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
n't
say
next
quarter
,
"
retorted
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
said
next
week
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Griffin
,
"
cried
Miss
Merry
,
pushing
him
off
,
and
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
no
!
<EOS>
not
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
It
sha
n't
be
till
I
choose
,
and
I
may
not
choose
it
to
be
for
months
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
glanced
up
at
her
from
the
ground
,
almost
as
darkly
as
he
had
looked
at
Tom
Pinch
;
but
held
his
peace
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
fright
of
a
Griffin
with
a
patch
over
his
eye
shall
dictate
to
me
or
have
a
voice
in
the
matter
,
"
said
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
   
<EOS>
Still
Mr
Jonas
held
his
peace
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
next
month
,
that
shall
be
the
very
earliest
;
but
I
wo
n't
say
when
it
shall
be
till
to
-
morrow
;
and
if
you
do
n't
like
that
,
it
shall
never
be
at
all
,
"
said
Merry
;
"
and
if
you
follow
me
about
and
wo
n't
leave
me
alone
,
it
shall
never
be
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
And
if
you
do
n't
do
everything
I
order
you
to
do
,
it
shall
never
be
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
So
do
n't
follow
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
Griffin
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
with
that
,
she
skipped
away
,
among
the
trees
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
,
my
lady
!
"
said
Jonas
,
looking
after
her
,
and
biting
a
piece
of
straw
,
almost
to
powder
;
"
you
'll
catch
it
for
this
,
when
you
ARE
married
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
well
now
<EOS>
---
it
keeps
one
on
,
somehow
,
and
you
know
it
---
but
I
'll
pay
you
off
scot
and
lot
by
-
and
-
bye
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
plaguey
dull
sort
of
a
place
for
a
man
to
be
sitting
by
himself
in
.
<EOS>
I
never
could
abide
a
mouldy
old
churchyard
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
turned
into
the
avenue
himself
,
Miss
Merry
,
who
was
far
ahead
,
happened
to
look
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Jonas
,
with
a
sullen
smile
,
and
a
nod
that
was
not
addressed
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Make
the
most
of
it
while
it
lasts
.
 
<EOS>
Get
in
your
hay
while
the
sun
shines
.
 
<EOS>
Take
your
own
way
as
long
as
it
's
in
your
power
,
my
lady

Is
in
part
professional

furnishes
the
reader
with
some
valuable
hints
in
relation
to
the
management
of
a
sick
chamber
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mould
was
surrounded
by
his
household
gods
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
enjoying
the
sweets
of
domestic
repose
,
and
gazing
on
them
with
a
calm
delight
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
being
sultry
,
and
the
window
open
,
the
legs
of
Mr
Mould
were
on
the
window
-
seat
,
and
his
back
reclined
against
the
shutter
.
 
<EOS>
Over
his
shining
head
a
handkerchief
was
drawn
,
to
guard
his
baldness
from
the
flies
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
fragrant
with
the
smell
of
punch
,
<EOS>
a
tumbler
of
which
grateful
compound
stood
upon
a
small
round
table
,
convenient
to
the
hand
of
Mr
Mould
;
so
deftly
mixed
that
as
his
eye
looked
down
into
the
cool
transparent
drink
,
another
eye
,
peering
brightly
from
behind
the
crisp
lemon
-
peel
,
looked
up
at
him
,
and
twinkled
like
a
star
.
   
<EOS>
Deep
in
the
City
,
and
within
the
ward
of
Cheap
,
stood
Mr
Mould
's
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
His
Harem
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
the
common
sitting
room
of
Mrs
Mould
and
family
,
was
at
the
back
,
over
the
little
counting
-
house
behind
the
shop
;
abutting
on
a
churchyard
small
and
shady
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
domestic
chamber
Mr
Mould
now
sat
;
gazing
,
a
placid
man
,
upon
his
punch
and
home
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
for
a
moment
at
a
time
,
he
sought
a
wider
prospect
,
whence
he
might
return
with
freshened
zest
to
these
enjoyments
,
his
moist
glance
wandered
like
a
sunbeam
through
a
rural
screen
of
scarlet
runners
,
trained
on
strings
before
the
window
,
and
he
looked
down
,
with
an
artist
's
eye
,
upon
the
graves
.
   
<EOS>
The
partner
of
his
life
,
and
daughters
twain
,
were
Mr
Mould
's
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Plump
as
any
partridge
was
each
Miss
Mould
,
and
Mrs
M
was
plumper
than
the
two
together
.
 
<EOS>
So
round
and
chubby
were
their
fair
proportions
,
that
they
might
have
been
the
bodies
once
belonging
to
the
angels
'
faces
in
the
shop
below
,
grown
up
,
with
other
heads
attached
to
make
them
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
Even
their
peachy
cheeks
were
puffed
out
and
distended
,
as
though
they
ought
of
right
to
be
performing
on
celestial
trumpets
.
 
<EOS>
The
bodiless
cherubs
in
the
shop
,
who
were
depicted
as
constantly
blowing
those
instruments
for
ever
and
ever
without
any
lungs
,
played
,
it
is
to
be
presumed
,
entirely
by
ear
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mould
looked
lovingly
at
Mrs
Mould
,
who
sat
hard
by
,
and
was
a
helpmate
to
him
in
his
punch
as
in
all
other
things
.
 
<EOS>
Each
seraph
daughter
,
too
,
enjoyed
her
share
of
his
regards
,
and
smiled
upon
him
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
So
bountiful
were
Mr
Mould
's
possessions
,
and
so
large
his
stock
in
trade
,
that
even
there
,
within
his
household
sanctuary
,
stood
a
cumbrous
press
,
whose
mahogany
maw
was
filled
with
shrouds
,
and
winding
-
sheets
,
and
other
furniture
of
funerals
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
though
the
Misses
Mould
had
been
brought
up
,
as
one
may
say
,
beneath
his
eye
,
it
had
cast
no
shadow
on
their
timid
infancy
or
blooming
youth
.
<EOS>
Sporting
behind
the
scenes
of
death
and
burial
from
cradlehood
,
the
Misses
Mould
knew
better
.
 
<EOS>
Hat
-
bands
,
to
them
,
were
but
so
many
yards
of
silk
or
crape
;
the
final
robe
but
such
a
quantity
of
linen
.
 
<EOS>
The
Misses
Mould
could
idealise
a
player
's
habit
,
or
a
court
-
lady
's
petticoat
,
or
even
an
act
of
parliament
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
to
be
taken
in
by
palls
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
them
sometimes
.
   
<EOS>
The
premises
of
Mr
Mould
were
hard
of
hearing
to
the
boisterous
noises
in
the
great
main
streets
,
and
nestled
in
a
quiet
corner
,
where
the
City
strife
became
a
drowsy
hum
,
that
sometimes
rose
and
sometimes
fell
and
sometimes
altogether
ceased
;
suggesting
to
a
thoughtful
mind
a
stoppage
in
Cheapside
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
came
sparkling
in
among
the
scarlet
runners
,
as
if
the
churchyard
winked
at
Mr
Mould
,
and
said
,
"
We
understand
each
other
;
"
and
from
the
distant
shop
<EOS>
a
pleasant
sound
arose
of
coffin
-
making
with
a
low
melodious
hammer
,
rat
,
tat
,
tat
,
tat
,
alike
promoting
slumber
and
digestion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
the
buzz
of
insects
,
"
said
Mr
Mould
,
closing
his
eyes
in
a
perfect
luxury
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
puts
one
in
mind
of
the
sound
of
animated
nature
in
the
agricultural
districts
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
exactly
like
the
woodpecker
tapping
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
woodpecker
tapping
the
hollow
ELM
tree
,
"
observed
Mrs
Mould
,
adapting
the
words
of
the
popular
melody
to
the
description
of
wood
commonly
used
in
the
trade
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
Mr
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
bad
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
again
,
Mrs
M
Hollow
elm
tree
,
eh
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Very
good
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
seen
worse
than
that
in
the
Sunday
papers
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Mould
,
thus
encouraged
,
took
a
little
more
of
the
punch
,
and
handed
it
to
her
daughters
,
who
dutifully
followed
the
example
of
their
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hollow
ELM
tree
,
eh
?
"
said
Mr
Mould
,
making
a
slight
motion
with
his
legs
in
his
enjoyment
of
the
joke
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
beech
in
the
song
.
<EOS>
Elm
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
,
that
's
one
of
the
best
things
I

<EOS>
He
was
so
excessively
tickled
by
the
jest
that
he
could
n't
forget
it
,
but
repeated
twenty
times
,
"
Elm

eh
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Elm
,
of
course

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
Upon
my
life
,
you
know
,
that
ought
to
be
sent
to
somebody
who
could
make
use
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
one
of
the
smartest
things
that
ever
was
said
.
 
<EOS>
Hollow

tree

<EOS>
of
course

<EOS>
Very
hollow

<EOS>
Ha

"
   
<EOS>
Here
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
room
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
Tacker
,
I
know
,
"
said
Mrs
Mould
,
"
by
the
wheezing
he
makes
.
<EOS>
Who
that
hears
him
now
,
would
suppose
he
'd
ever
had
wind
enough
to
carry
the
feathers
on
his
head
!
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
Tacker
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Tacker
,
looking
in
a
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
our
Governor
was
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
so
he
is
,
"
cried
Mould
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
did
n't
see
you
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Tacker
,
looking
in
a
little
farther
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
be
inclined
to
take
a
walking
one
of
two
,
with
the
plain
wood
and
a
tin
plate
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Mould
,
"
much
too
common
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
to
say
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
'em
it
was
precious
low
,
"
observed
Mr
Tacker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
'em
to
go
somewhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
do
that
style
of
business
here
,
"
said
Mr
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
Like
their
impudence
to
propose
it
.
 
<EOS>
Who
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
returned
Tacker
,
pausing
,
"
that
's
where
it
is
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
beadle
's
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
beadle
's
son
-
in
-
law
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
it
if
the
beadle
follows
in
his
cocked
hat
;
not
else
.
 
<EOS>
We
carry
it
off
that
way
,
by
looking
official
,
but
it
'll
be
low
enough
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
His
cocked
hat
,
mind
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
,
sir

"
rejoined
Tacker
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
's
below
,
and
wants
to
speak
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
Mrs
Gamp
to
come
upstairs
,
"
said
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
Mrs
Gamp
,
what
's
YOUR
news
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
in
question
was
by
this
time
in
the
doorway
,
curtseying
to
Mrs
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
a
peculiar
fragrance
was
borne
upon
the
breeze
,
as
if
a
passing
fairy
had
hiccoughed
,
and
had
previously
been
to
a
wine
-
vaults
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
made
no
response
to
Mr
Mould
,
but
curtseyed
to
Mrs
Mould
again
,
and
held
up
her
hands
and
eyes
,
as
in
a
devout
thanksgiving
that
she
looked
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
neatly
,
but
not
gaudily
attired
,
in
the
weeds
she
had
worn
when
Mr
Pecksniff
had
the
pleasure
of
making
her
acquaintance
;
and
was
perhaps
the
turning
of
a
scale
more
snuffy
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
happy
creeturs
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
observed
,
"
<EOS>
as
time
runs
back'ards
with
,
and
you
are
one
,
Mrs
Mould
;
not
that
he
need
do
nothing
except
use
you
in
his
most
owldacious
way
for
years
to
come
,
I
'm
sure
;
for
young
you
are
and
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
says
to
Mrs
Harris
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
continued
,
"
only
t'other
day
;
the
last
Monday
evening
fortnight
as
ever
dawned
upon
this
Piljian
's
Projiss
of
a
mortal
wale
;
I
says
to
Mrs
Harris
when
she
says
to
me
,
"
Years
and
our
trials
,
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
,
sets
marks
upon
us
all
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
Say
not
the
words
,
Mrs
Harris
,
if
you
and
me
is
to
be
continual
friends
,
for
sech
is
not
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Mould
,
"
I
says
,
making
so
free
,
I
will
confess
,
as
use
the
name
,
<EOS>
"
(
she
curtseyed
here
)
,
"
"
is
one
of
them
that
goes
agen
<EOS>
the
obserwation
straight
;
and
never
,
Mrs
Harris
,
whilst
I
've
a
drop
of
breath
to
draw
<EOS>
,
will
I
set
by
,
and
not
stand
up
,
<EOS>
do
n't
think
it
.
"
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
"
I
ast
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
"
says
Mrs
Harris
,
"
and
I
humbly
grant
your
grace
;
for
if
ever
a
woman
lived
as
would
see
her
feller
creeturs
into
fits
to
serve
her
friends
,
well
do
I
know
that
woman
's
name
is
Sairey
Gamp
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
point
she
was
fain
to
stop
for
breath
;
and
advantage
may
be
taken
of
the
circumstance
,
to
state
that
a
fearful
mystery
surrounded
this
lady
of
the
name
of
Harris
,
whom
no
one
in
the
circle
of
Mrs
Gamp
's
acquaintance
had
ever
seen
;
neither
did
any
human
being
know
her
place
of
residence
,
though
Mrs
Gamp
appeared
on
her
own
showing
to
be
in
constant
communication
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
conflicting
rumours
on
the
subject
;
but
the
prevalent
opinion
was
that
she
was
a
phantom
of
Mrs
Gamp
's
brain
---
as
Messrs.
Doe
and
Roe
are
fictions
of
the
law
---
<EOS>
created
for
the
express
purpose
of
holding
visionary
dialogues
with
her
on
all
manner
of
subjects
,
and
invariably
winding
up
with
a
compliment
to
the
excellence
of
her
nature
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
likeways
what
a
pleasure
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
turning
with
a
tearful
smile
towards
the
daughters
,
"
to
see
them
two
young
ladies
as
I
know'd
afore
a
tooth
in
their
pretty
heads
was
cut
,
and
have
many
a
day
seen
---
ah
,
the
sweet
creeturs
!
<EOS>
---
playing
at
berryins
down
in
the
shop
,
and
follerin
'
the
order
-
book
to
its
long
home
in
the
iron
safe
!
 
<EOS>
But
that
's
all
past
and
over
,
Mr
Mould
;
"
as
she
thus
got
in
a
carefully
regulated
routine
to
that
gentleman
,
she
shook
her
head
waggishly
;
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
past
and
over
now
,
sir
,
an't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Changes
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
changes
!
"
returned
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
More
changes
too
,
to
come
,
afore
we
've
done
with
changes
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
nodding
yet
more
waggishly
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Young
ladies
with
such
faces
thinks
of
something
else
besides
berryins
,
do
n't
they
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
said
Mould
,
with
a
chuckle
---
"
<EOS>
Not
bad
in
Mrs
Gamp
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
you
do
know
,
sir
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
and
so
does
Mrs
Mould
,
your
'
ansome
pardner
too
,
sir
;
and
so
do
I
,
although
the
blessing
of
a
daughter
was
deniged
me
;
which
,
if
we
had
had
one
,
Gamp
would
certainly
have
drunk
its
little
shoes
right
off
its
feet
,
as
with
our
precious
boy
he
did
,
and
arterward
send
the
child
a
errand
to
sell
his
wooden
leg
for
any
money
it
would
fetch
as
matches
in
the
rough
,
and
bring
it
home
in
liquor
;
which
was
truly
done
beyond
his
years
,
for
ev'ry
individgle
penny
that
child
lost
at
toss
or
buy
for
kidney
ones
;
and
come
home
arterwards
quite
bold
,
to
break
the
news
,
and
offering
to
drown
himself
if
sech
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
parents
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
you
do
know
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
wiping
her
eye
with
her
shawl
,
and
resuming
the
thread
of
her
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
besides
births
and
berryins
in
the
newspapers
,
an't
there
,
Mr
Mould
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mould
winked
at
Mrs
Mould
,
whom
he
had
by
this
time
taken
on
his
knee
,
and
said
:
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
A
good
deal
more
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
,
Mrs
Gamp
is
very
far
from
bad

my

"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
marryings
,
an't
there
,
sir

"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
while
both
the
daughters
blushed
and
tittered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
their
precious
hearts
,
and
well
they
knows
it

<EOS>
Well
you

know'd
it
too

and
well
did
Mrs
Mould
,
when
you
was
at
their
time
of
life

<EOS>
But
my
opinion
is

you
're
all
of

age
now

<EOS>
For
as

you

"
Oh

Fie

<EOS>
Nonsense

Mrs

replied
the
undertaker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Devilish
smart

<EOS>
Ca

<EOS>

this
was
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
My

"
---
aloud
again
---
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
can
drink
a
glass
of
rum
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
sit
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
took
the
chair
that
was
nearest
the
door
,
and
casting
up
her
eyes
towards
the
ceiling
,
feigned
to
be
wholly
insensible
to
the
fact
of
a
glass
of
rum
being
in
preparation
,
until
it
was
placed
in
her
hand
by
one
of
the
young
ladies
,
when
she
exhibited
the
greatest
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
thing
,
"
she
said
,
"
as
hardly
ever
,
Mrs
Mould
,
occurs
with
me
unless
it
is
when
I
am
indispoged
,
and
find
my
half
a
pint
of
porter
settling
heavy
on
the
chest
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Harris
often
and
often
says
to
me
,
"
Sairey
Gamp
,
"
she
says
,
"
you
raly
do
amaze
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Harris
,
"
I
says
to
her
,
"
why
so
?
 
<EOS>
Give
it
a
name
,
I
beg

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Telling
the
truth
then

ma'am

says
Mrs
Harris
,
"
and
shaming
him
as
shall
be
nameless
betwixt
you

never

did
I
think
till
I
<EOS>
know'd

on

that

takes

<EOS>
"
Mrs
Harris
,
"
I
says
to
her
,
"
none
on
us
knows
what
we
can
do
till
we
tries
;
and
wunst
,
when
me
and
Gamp
kept
'
ouse
,
I
thought
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
"
I
says
,
"
my
half
a
pint
of
porter
fully
satisfies
;
perwisin

,
Mrs
Harris
,
that
it
is
brought
reg'lar

draw'd
mild

<EOS>
Whether
I
sicks

monthlies

ma'am

I
hope
I
does
my
duty

but
I
am
but
a
poor
woman

and
I
earns
my
living
hard
;
therefore
I
DO
require
it

which
I
makes
confession

to
be
brought
reg'lar

draw'd
mild

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
   
The
precise
connection
between
these
observations
and
the
glass
of
rum
,
did
not
appear
;
for
Mrs
Gamp
proposing
as
a
toast
"
The
best
of
lucks
to
all
!
"
took
off
the
dram
in
quite
a
scientific
manner
,
without
any
further
remarks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
's
your
news
,
Mrs
Gamp
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mould
again
,
as
that
lady
wiped
her
lips
upon
her
shawl
,
and
nibbled
a
corner
off
a
soft
biscuit
,
which
she
appeared
to
carry
in
her
pocket
as
a
provision
against
contingent
drams
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
's
Mr
Chuffey
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Chuffey
,
sir

"
she
replied
,
"
is
jest
as
usual
;
he
an't
no
better

he

<EOS>
I
take
it
very
kind
in
the

wrote
up
to

said
,

ev'rythink

<EOS>
There

If

<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
to
speak
to
me
about
,
Mrs
Gamp
?
"
said
Mould
,
coming
to
the
point
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jest
this
,
sir
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
returned
,
"
with
thanks
to
you
for
asking
.
<EOS>
There
IS
a
gent

at

ill

<EOS>
They
have
a

nurse
as
was
recommended
from
Bartholomew
's
;

well

Mrs

<EOS>
But
she
is
otherways
engaged
at

<EOS>
they
are
in
wants
of
night

watching
;
consequent
she
says
to
them
,
having
reposed
the
greatest
friendliness
in
me
for
twenty
year
,
"
The
soberest
person
going

the
best
of
blessings

Mrs

<EOS>
Send
a
boy
to
Kingsgate
Street

she
says
,
"
and
snap
her
up
at
any

more

guineas

My

down

this
job
promising
so
well
,
why
not
unite
the
two
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
I
says
,
"
not
unbeknown
to
Mr
Mould
,
and
therefore
do
not
think
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
go
to
Mr
Mould
,
"
I
says
,
"
and
ast
him
,
if
you
like
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
Here
she
looked
sideways
at
the
undertaker
,
and
came
to
a
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Night
-
watching
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mould
,
rubbing
his
chin
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
eight
o'clock
till
eight
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
deceive
you
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
rejoined
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
go
back
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
said
would
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
free
,
then
,
sir
,
to
attend
to
Mr
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
His
ways
bein
'
quiet
,
and
his
hours
early
,
he
'd
be
abed
,
sir
,
nearly
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
deny
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
with
meekness
,
"
that
I
am
but
a
poor
woman
,
and
that
the
money
is
a
object
;
but
do
not
let
that
act
upon
you
,
Mr
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
Rich
folks
may
ride
on
camels
,
but
it
an't
so
easy
for
'em
to
see
out
of
a
needle
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
my
comfort
,
and
I
hope
I
knows
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
observed
Mould
,
"
I
do
n't
see
any
particular
objection
to
your
earning
an
honest
penny
under
such
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
should
keep
it
quiet
,
I
think
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
mention
it
to
Mr
Chuzzlewit
on
his
return
,
for
instance
,
unless
it
were
necessary
,
or
he
asked
you
pointblank
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
words
was
on
my
lips
,
sir
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suppoging
that
the
gent
should
die
,
I
hope
I
might
take
the
liberty
of
saying
as
I
know'd
some
one
in
the
undertaking
line
,
and
yet
give
no
offence
to
you
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
said
Mould
,
with
much
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
casually
remark
,
in
such
a
case
,
that
we
do
the
thing
pleasantly
and
in
a
great
variety
of
styles
,
and
are
generally
considered
to
make
it
as
agreeable
as
possible
to
the
feelings
of
the
survivors
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
obtrude
it
,
do
n't
obtrude
it
.
 
<EOS>
Easy
,
easy
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
you
may
as
well
give
Mrs
Gamp
a
card
or
two
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
received
them
,
and
scenting
no
more
rum
in
the
wind
(
for
the
bottle
was
locked
up
again
)
rose
to
take
her
departure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wishing
ev'ry
happiness
to
this
happy
family
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
"
with
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Good
arternoon
,
Mrs
Mould
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
Mr
would
I
should
be
jealous
of
you
,
ma'am
;
and
I
'm
sure
,
if
I
was
you
,
I
should
be
jealous
of
Mr

.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
!
 
<EOS>
Bah
,
bah
!
 
<EOS>
Go
along
,
Mrs
Gamp
!
"
cried
the
delighted
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
young
ladies
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
dropping
a
curtsey
,
"
bless
their
sweet
looks
<EOS>
---
how
they
can
ever
reconsize
it
with
their
duties
to
be
so
grown
up
with
such
young
parents
,
it
an't
for
sech
as
me
to
give
a
guess
at
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
Be
off
,
Mrs
Gamp
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
height
of
his
gratification
he
actually
pinched
Mrs
Mould
as
he
said
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
,
"
he
observed
,
when
Mrs
Gamp
had
at
last
withdrawn
and
shut
the
door
,
"
that
's
a
ve
-
ry
shrewd
woman
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
woman
whose
intellect
is
immensely
superior
to
her
station
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
woman
who
observes
and
reflects
in
an
uncommon
manner
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
the
sort
of
woman
now
,
"
said
Mould
,
<EOS>
drawing
his
silk
handkerchief
over
his
head
again
,
and
composing
himself
for
a
nap
"
one
would
almost
feel
disposed
to
bury
for
nothing
;
and
do
it
neatly
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Mould
and
her
daughters
fully
concurred
in
these
remarks
;
the
subject
of
which
had
by
this
time
reached
the
street
,
where
she
experienced
so
much
inconvenience
from
the
air
,
that
she
was
obliged
to
stand
under
an
archway
for
a
short
time
,
to
recover
herself
.
<EOS>
Even
after
this
precaution
,
she
walked
so
unsteadily
as
to
attract
the
compassionate
regards
of
divers
kind
-
hearted
boys
,
who
took
the
liveliest
interest
in
her
disorder
;
and
in
their
simple
language
bade
her
be
of
good
cheer
,
for
she
was
"
only
a
little
screwed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Whatever
she
was
,
or
whatever
name
the
vocabulary
of
medical
science
would
have
bestowed
upon
her
malady
,
Mrs
Gamp
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
way
home
again
;
and
arriving
at
the
house
of
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
&
Son
,
lay
down
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Remaining
there
until
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
and
then
persuading
poor
old
Chuffey
to
betake
himself
to
bed
,
she
sallied
forth
upon
her
new
engagement
.
<EOS>
First
,
she
went
to
her
private
lodgings
in
Kingsgate
Street
,
for
a
bundle
of
robes
and
wrappings
comfortable
in
the
night
season
;
and
then
repaired
to
the
Bull
in
Holborn
,
which
she
reached
as
the
clocks
were
striking
eight
.
   
<EOS>
As
she
turned
into
the
yard
,
she
stopped
;
for
the
landlord
,
landlady
,
and
head
chambermaid
,
were
all
on
the
threshold
together
talking
earnestly
with
a
young
gentleman
who
seemed
to
have
just
come
or
to
be
just
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
words
that
struck
upon
Mrs
Gamp
's
ear
obviously
bore
reference
to
the
patient
;
and
it
being
expedient
that
all
good
attendants
should
know
as
much
as
possible
about
the
case
on
which
their
skill
is
brought
to
bear
,
Mrs
Gamp
listened
as
a
matter
of
duty
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
better
,
then
?
"
observed
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Worse
!
"
said
the
landlord
.
   
<EOS>
"
Much
worse
,
"
added
the
landlady
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
a
deal
badder
,
"
cried
the
chambermaid
from
the
background
,
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
,
and
shaking
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
of
it
is
,
that
I
have
no
idea
<EOS>
what
friends
or
relations
he
has
,
or
where
they
live
,
except
that
it
certainly
is
not
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
looked
at
the
landlady
;
the
landlady
looked
at
the
landlord
;
and
the
chambermaid
remarked
,
hysterically
,
"
that
of
all
the
many
wague
directions
she
had
ever
seen
or
heerd
of
(
<EOS>
and
they
was
n't
few
in
an
hotel
)
,
THAT
was
the
waguest
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
you
see
,
"
pursued
the
gentleman
,
"
as
I
told
you
yesterday
when
you
sent
to
me
,
I
really
know
very
little
about
him
.
<EOS>
We
were
school
-
fellows
together
;
but
since
that
time
I
have
only
met
him
twice
.
 
<EOS>
On
both
occasions
I
was
in
London
for
a
boy
's
holiday
(
having
come
up
for
a
week
or
so
from
Wiltshire
)
,
and
lost
sight
of
him
again
directly
.
 
<EOS>
The
letter
bearing
my
name
and
address
which
you
found
upon
his
table
,
and
which
led
to
your
applying
to
me
,
is
in
answer
,
you
will
observe
,
to
one
he
wrote
from
this
house
the
very
day
he
was
taken
ill
,
making
an
appointment
with
him
at
his
own
request
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
his
letter
,
if
you
wish
to
see
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
read
it
;
the
landlady
looked
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
chambermaid
,
in
the
background
,
made
out
as
much
of
it
as
she
could
,
and
invented
the
rest
;
believing
it
all
from
that
time
forth
as
a
positive
piece
of
evidence
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
very
little
luggage
,
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
observed
the
gentleman
,
who
was
no
other
than
our
old
friend
,
John
Westlock
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
a
portmanteau
,
"
said
the
landlord
;
"
and
very
little
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
few
pounds
in
his
purse
,
though
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
sealed
up
,
and
in
the
cash
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
memorandum
of
the
amount
,
which
you
're
welcome
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
John
,
"
<EOS>
as
the
medical
gentleman
says
the
fever
must
take
its
course
,
and
nothing
can
be
done
just
now
beyond
giving
him
his
drinks
regularly
and
having
him
carefully
attended
to
,
nothing
more
can
be
said
that
I
know
of
,
until
he
is
in
a
condition
to
give
us
some
information
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
suggest
anything
else
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
N
---
 
<EOS>
no
,
"
replied
the
landlord
,
"
except
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Except
,
who
's
to
pay
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
hesitated
the
landlord
,
"
it
would
be
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
as
well
,
"
said
the
landlady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
forgetting
to
remember
the
servants
,
"
said
the
chambermaid
in
a
bland
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
is
but
reasonable
,
I
fully
admit
,
"
said
John
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
you
have
the
stock
in
hand
to
go
upon
for
the
present
;
and
I
will
readily
undertake
to
pay
the
doctor
and
the
nurses
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
rayal
gentleman
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
groaned
her
admiration
so
audibly
,
that
they
all
turned
round
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
felt
the
necessity
of
advancing
,
bundle
in
hand
,
and
introducing
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
night
-
nurse
,
"
she
observed
,
"
from
Kingsgate
Street
,
well
beknown
to
Mrs
Prig
the
day
-
nurse
,
and
the
best
of
creeturs
.
 
<EOS>
How
is
the
poor
dear
gentleman
to
-
night
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
an't
no
better
yet
,
still
that
is
what
must
be
expected
and
prepared
for
.
 
<EOS>
It
an't
the
fust
time
by
a
many
score
,
ma'am
,
"
dropping
a
curtsey
to
the
landlady
,
"
that
Mrs
Prig
and
me
has
nussed
together
,
turn
and
turn
about
,
one
off
,
one
on
.
 
<EOS>
We
knows
each
other
's
ways
,
and
often
gives
relief
when
others
fail
.
 
<EOS>
Our
charges
is
but
low
,
sir
"
<EOS>
---
Mrs
Gamp
addressed
herself
to
John
on
this
head
---
"
considerin
'
the
nater
of
our
painful
dooty
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
wos
made
accordin
'
to
our
wishes
,
they
would
be
easy
paid
.
"
   
<EOS>
Regarding
herself
as
having
now
delivered
her
inauguration
address
,
Mrs
Gamp
curtseyed
all
round
,
and
signified
her
wish
to
be
conducted
to
the
scene
of
her
official
duties
.
 
<EOS>
The
chambermaid
led
her
,
through
a
variety
of
intricate
passages
,
to
the
top
of
the
house
;
and
pointing
at
length
to
a
solitary
door
at
the
end
of
a
gallery
,
informed
her
that
yonder
was
the
chamber
where
the
patient
lay
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
she
hurried
off
with
all
the
speed
she
could
make
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
traversed
the
gallery
in
a
great
heat
from
having
carried
her
large
bundle
up
so
many
stairs
,
and
tapped
at
the
door
which
was
immediately
opened
by
Mrs
Prig
,
bonneted
and
shawled
and
all
impatience
to
be
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Prig
was
of
the
Gamp
build
,
but
not
so
fat
;
and
her
voice
was
deeper
and
more
like
a
man
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
also
a
beard
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
began
to
think
you
warn't
a
-
coming
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Prig
observed
,
in
some
displeasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
made
good
to
-
morrow
night
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
<EOS>
"
Honorable
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
go
and
fetch
my
things
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
had
begun
to
make
signs
of
inquiry
in
reference
to
the
position
of
the
patient
and
his
overhearing
them
---
for
there
was
a
screen
before
the
door
---
when
Mrs
Prig
settled
that
point
easily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
aloud
,
"
he
's
quiet
,
but
his
wits
is
gone
.
 
<EOS>
It
an't
<EOS>
no
matter
wot
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Anythin
'
to
tell
afore
you
goes
,
my
dear
?
"
asked
Mrs
Gamp
,
setting
her
bundle
down
inside
the
door
,
and
looking
affectionately
at
her
partner
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
pickled
salmon
,
"
Mrs
Prig
replied
,
"
is
quite
delicious
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
partlck'ler
recommend
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
have
nothink
to
say
to
the
cold
meat
,
for
it
tastes
of
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
The
drinks
is
all
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
expressed
herself
much
gratified
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
physic
and
them
things
is
on
the
drawers
and
mankleshelf
,
"
said
Mrs
Prig
,
cursorily
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
took
his
last
slime
draught
at
seven

<EOS>
The
easy

chair
an't
soft
enough

<EOS>
You
'll
want
his
piller

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
thanked
her
for
these
hints
,
and
giving
her
a
friendly
good
night
,
held
the
door
open
until
she
had
disappeared
at
the
other
end
of
the
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
Having
thus
performed
the
hospitable
duty
of
seeing
her
safely
off
,
she
shut
it
,
locked
it
on
the
inside
,
took
up
her
bundle
,
walked
round
the
screen
,
and
entered
on
her
occupation
of
the
sick
chamber
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
dull
,
but
not
so
bad
as
might
be
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
see
a
parapidge
,
in
case
of
fire
,
and
lots
of
roofs
and
chimley
-
pots
to
walk
upon
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
will
be
seen
from
these
remarks
that
Mrs
Gamp
was
looking
out
of
window
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
exhausted
the
prospect
,
she
tried
the
easy
-
chair
,
which
she
indignantly
declared
was
"
harder
than
a
brickbadge
.
"
 
<EOS>
Next
she
pursued
her
researches
among
the
physic
-
bottles
,
glasses
,
jugs
,
and
tea
-
cups
;
and
when
she
had
entirely
satisfied
her
curiosity
on
all
these
subjects
of
investigation
,
she
untied
her
bonnet
-
strings
and
strolled
up
to
the
bedside
to
take
a
look
at
the
patient
.
   
<EOS>
A
young
man
---
dark
and
not
ill
-
looking
---
with
long
black
hair
,
that
seemed
the
blacker
for
the
whiteness
of
the
bed
-
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
partly
open
,
and
he
never
ceased
to
roll
his
head
from
side
to
side
upon
the
pillow
,
keeping
his
body
almost
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
utter
words
;
but
every
now
and
then
gave
vent
to
an
expression
of
impatience
or
fatigue
,
sometimes
of
surprise
;
and
still
his
restless
head
---
<EOS>
oh
,
weary
,
weary
hour
!
<EOS>
---
went
to
and
fro
without
a
moment
's
intermission
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
solaced
herself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
stood
looking
at
him
with
her
head
inclined
a
little
sideways
,
as
a
connoisseur
might
gaze
upon
a
doubtful
work
of
art
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
a
horrible
remembrance
of
one
branch
of
her
calling
took
possession
of
the
woman
;
and
stooping
down
,
she
pinned
his
wandering
arms
against
his
sides
,
to
see
how
he
would
look
if
laid
out
as
a
dead
man
.
 
<EOS>
Her
fingers
itched
to
compose
his
limbs
in
that
last
marble
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
walking
away
from
the
bed
,
"
he
'd
make
a
lovely
corpse
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
now
proceeded
to
unpack
her
bundle
;
lighted
a
candle
with
the
aid
of
a
fire
-
box
on
the
drawers
;
filled
a
small
kettle
,
as
a
preliminary
to
refreshing
herself
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
course
of
the
night
;
laid
what
she
called
"
a
little
bit
of
fire
,
"
for
the
same
philanthropic
purpose
;
and
also
set
forth
a
small
tea
-
board
,
that
nothing
might
be
wanting
for
her
comfortable
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
These
preparations
occupied
so
long
,
that
when
they
were
brought
to
a
conclusion
it
was
high
time
to
think
about
supper
;
so
she
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
young
woman
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
to
the
assistant
chambermaid
,
in
a
tone
expressive
of
weakness
,
"
that
I
could
pick
a
little
bit
of
pickled
salmon
,
with
a
nice
little
sprig
of
fennel
,
and
a
sprinkling
of
white
pepper
.
 
<EOS>
I
takes
new
bread
,
my
dear
,
with
just
a
little
pat
of
fresh
butter
,
and
a
mossel
of
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
In
case
there
should
be
such
a
thing
as
a
cowcumber
in
the
'
ouse
,
will
you
be
so
kind
as
bring
it
,
<EOS>
for
I
'm
rather
partial
to
'em
,
and
they
does
a
world
of
good
in
a
sick
room
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
draws
the
Brighton
Old
Tipper
here
,
I
takes
THAT
ale
at
night
,
my
love
,
it
bein
'
considered
wakeful
by
the
doctors
.
 
<EOS>
And
whatever
you
do
,
young
woman
,
do
n't
bring
more
than
a
shilling's
-
worth
of
gin
and
water
-
warm
when
I
rings
the
bell
a
second
time
;
for
that
is
always
my
allowance
,
and
I
never
takes
a
drop
beyond
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
preferred
these
moderate
requests
,
Mrs
Gamp
observed
that
she
would
stand
at
the
door
until
the
order
was
executed
,
to
the
end
that
the
patient
might
not
be
disturbed
by
her
opening
it
a
second
time
;
and
therefore
she
would
thank
the
young
woman
to
"
look
sharp
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
tray
was
brought
with
everything
upon
it
,
even
to
the
cucumber
and
Mrs
Gamp
accordingly
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink
in
high
good
humour
.
<EOS>
The
extent
to
which
she
availed
herself
of
the
vinegar
,
and
supped
up
that
refreshing
fluid
with
the
blade
of
her
knife
,
can
scarcely
be
expressed
in
narrative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
sighed
Mrs
Gamp
,
as
she
meditated
over
the
warm
shilling's
-
worth
,
"
what
a
blessed
thing
it
is
---
living
in
a
wale
---
to
be
contented
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
blessed
thing
it
is
to
make
sick
people
happy
in
their
beds
,
and
never
mind
one
's
self
as
long
as
one
can
do
a
service
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
a
finer
cowcumber
was
ever
<EOS>
grow'd
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
never
see
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
moralised
in
the
same
vein
until
her
glass
was
empty
,
and
then
admistered
the
patient
's
medicine
,
by
the
simple
process
of
clutching
his
windpipe
to
make
him
gasp
,
and
immediately
pouring
it
down
his
throat
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
a'most
forgot
the
piller
,
I
declare
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
drawing
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
Now
he
's
comfortable
as
he
can
be
,
I
'm
sure
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
try
to
make
myself
as
much
so
as
I
can
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
she
went
about
the
construction
of
an
extemporaneous
bed
in
the
easy
-
chair
,
with
the
addition
of
the
next
easy
one
for
her
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Having
formed
the
best
couch
that
the
circumstances
admitted
of
,
she
took
out
of
her
bundle
a
yellow
night
-
cap
,
of
prodigious
size
,
in
shape
resembling
a
cabbage
;
which
article
of
dress
she
fixed
and
tied
on
with
the
utmost
care
,
previously
divesting
herself
of
a
row
of
bald
old
curls
that
could
scarcely
be
called
false
,
they
were
so
very
innocent
of
anything
approaching
to
deception
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
same
repository
she
brought
forth
a
night
-
jacket
,
in
which
she
also
attired
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
she
produced
a
watchman
's
coat
which
she
tied
round
her
neck
by
the
sleeves
,
so
that
she
become
two
people
;
and
looked
,
behind
,
as
if
she
were
in
the
act
of
being
embraced
by
one
of
the
old
patrol
.
   
<EOS>
All
these
arrangements
made
,
she
lighted
the
rush
-
light
,
coiled
herself
up
on
her
couch
,
and
went
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Ghostly
and
dark
the
room
became
,
and
full
of
lowering
shadows
.
 
<EOS>
The
distant
noises
in
the
streets
were
gradually
hushed
;
the
house
was
quiet
as
a
sepulchre
;
the
dead
of
might
was
coffined
in
the
silent
city
.
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
weary
,
weary
hour
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
haggard
mind
,
groping
darkly
through
the
past
;
incapable
of
detaching
itself
from
the
miserable
present
;
dragging
its
heavy
chain
of
care
through
imaginary
feasts
and
revels
,
and
scenes
of
awful
pomp
;
seeking
but
a
moment
's
rest
among
the
long
-
forgotten
haunts
of
childhood
,
and
the
resorts
of
yesterday
;
and
dimly
finding
fear
and
horror
everywhere
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
weary
,
weary
hour
!
 
<EOS>
What
were
the
wanderings
of
Cain
,
to
these
!
   
<EOS>
Still
,
without
a
moment
's
interval
,
the
burning
head
tossed
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
from
time
to
time
,
fatigue
,
impatience
,
suffering
,
and
surprise
,
found
utterance
upon
that
rack
,
and
plainly
too
,
though
never
once
in
words
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
in
the
solemn
hour
of
midnight
,
he
began
to
talk
;
waiting
awfully
for
answers
sometimes
;
as
though
invisible
companions
were
about
his
bed
;
and
so
replying
to
their
speech
and
questioning
again
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
awoke
,
and
sat
up
in
her
bed
;
presenting
on
the
wall
the
shadow
of
a
gigantic
night
constable
,
struggling
with
a
prisoner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
in
sharp
reproof
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
make
none
of
that
noise
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
alteration
in
the
face
,
or
in
the
incessant
motion
of
the
head
,
but
he
talked
on
wildly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
coming
out
of
the
chair
with
an
impatient
shiver
;
"
I
thought
I
was
a
-
sleepin
'
too
pleasant
to
last
!
 
<EOS>
The
devil
's
in
the
night
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
it
's
turned
so
chilly
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
drink
so
much
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
sick
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
ruin
us
all
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
how
the
fountain
sinks
?
 
<EOS>
Look
at
the
mark
where
the
sparkling
water
was
just
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sparkling
water
,
indeed
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
have
a
sparkling
cup
<EOS>
o
'
tea
<EOS>
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
hold
your
noise
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
burst
into
a
laugh
,
which
,
being
prolonged
,
fell
off
into
a
dismal
wail
.
 
<EOS>
Checking
himself
,
with
fierce
inconstancy
<EOS>
he
began
to
count
---
fast
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
---
two
---
three
---
four
---
five
---
six
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
,
two
,
buckle
my
shoe
,
"
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
who
was
now
on
her
knees
,
lighting
the
fire
,
"
three
,
four
,
shut
the
door
,
"
<EOS>
---
I
wish
you
'd
shut
your
mouth
,
young
man
---
"
five
,
six
,
picking
up
sticks
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
'd
got
a
few
handy
,
I
should
have
the
kettle
boiling
all
the
sooner
.
"
   
<EOS>
Awaiting
this
desirable
consummation
,
she
sat
down
so
close
to
the
fender
(
which
was
a
high
one
)
that
her
nose
rested
upon
it
;
and
for
some
time
she
drowsily
amused
herself
by
sliding
that
feature
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
brass
top
,
as
far
as
she
could
,
without
changing
her
position
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
maintained
,
all
the
while
,
a
running
commentary
upon
the
wanderings
of
the
man
in
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
makes
five
hundred
and
twenty
-
one
men
,
all
dressed
alike
,
and
with
the
same
distortion
on
their
faces
,
that
have
passed
in
at
the
window
,
and
out
at
the
door
,
"
he
cried
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
there
!
<EOS>
Five
hundred
and
twenty

two
---
twenty

three

twenty

Do
you
see
them

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah

<EOS>
I
see
'
em

"
said
Mrs
Gamp
;
"
all
the
whole
kit
of
'em
numbered
like
hackney

coaches

an't
they

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Touch

<EOS>
Let

be
sure
of
this

Touch

<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
your
next
draught
when
I

made
the

retorted
Mrs
Gamp
,
composedly
,
"
and
you
'll
be
touched
then
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
touched
up
,
too
,
if
you
do
n't
take
it
quiet

"
   
<EOS>
"
Five
hundred
and
twenty
-
eight
,
five
hundred
and
twenty
-
nine
,
five
hundred
and
thirty
.
<EOS>
---
Look
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
now
?
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
coming
four
abreast
,
each
man
with
his
arm
entwined
in
the
next
man
's
,
and
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
that
upon
the
arm
of
every
man
,
and
on
the
flag
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Spiders
,
p'raps
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
Crape
!
 
<EOS>
Black
crape
!
 
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
why
do
they
wear
it
outside
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
have
'em
carry
black
crape
in
their
insides
?
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Gamp
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
noise
,
hold
your
noise
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fire
beginning
by
this
time
to
impart
a
grateful
warmth
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Gamp
became
silent
;
gradually
rubbed
her
nose
more
and
more
slowly
along
the
top
of
the
fender
;
and
fell
into
a
heavy
doze
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
awakened
by
the
room
ringing
(
as
she
fancied
)
with
a
name
she
knew
:
   
"
Chuzzlewit
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
sound
was
so
distinct
and
real
,
and
so
full
of
agonised
entreaty
,
that
Mrs
Gamp
jumped
up
in
terror
,
and
ran
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
expected
to
find
the
passage
filled
with
people
,
come
to
tell
her
that
the
house
in
the
city
had
taken
fire
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
place
was
empty
;
not
a
soul
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
opened
the
window
,
and
looked
out
.
<EOS>
Dark
,
dull
,
dingy
,
and
desolate
house
-
tops
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
passed
to
her
seat
again
,
she
glanced
at
the
patient
.
 
<EOS>
Just
the
same
;
but
silent
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
was
so
warm
now
,
that
she
threw
off
the
watchman
's
coat
,
and
fanned
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
seemed
to
make
the
wery
bottles
ring
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
could
I
have
been
a
-
dreaming
of
?
 
<EOS>
That
dratted
Chuffey
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
supposition
was
probable
enough
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
the
song
of
the
steaming
kettle
,
quite
restored
the
tone
of
Mrs
Gamp
's
nerves
,
which
were
none
of
the
weakest
.
 
<EOS>
She
brewed
her
tea
;
made
some
buttered
toast
;
and
sat
down
at
the
tea
-
board
,
with
her
face
to
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
When
once
again
,
in
a
tone
more
terrible
than
that
which
had
vibrated
in
her
slumbering
ear
,
these
words
were
shrieked
out
:
   
<EOS>
"
Chuzzlewit
!
 
Jonas
!
 
<EOS>
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
dropped
the
cup
she
was
in
the
act
of
raising
to
her
lips
,
and
turned
round
with
a
start
that
made
the
little
tea
-
board
leap
.
<EOS>
The
cry
had
come
from
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
bright
morning
<EOS>
the
next
time
Mrs
Gamp
looked
out
of
the
window
,
and
the
sun
was
rising
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
Lighter
and
lighter
grew
the
sky
,
and
noisier
the
streets
;
and
high
into
the
summer
air
uprose
the
smoke
of
newly
kindled
fires
,
until
the
busy
day
was
broad
awake
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Prig
relieved
punctually
,
having
passed
a
good
night
at
her
other
patient
's
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Westlock
came
at
the
same
time
,
but
he
was
not
admitted
,
the
disorder
being
infectious
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
came
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
he
could
do
,
under
the
circumstances
,
and
he
did
it
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
a
night
,
nurse

"
   
<EOS>
"
Restless

Mrs

Oh

Only

<EOS>
"
Well

said
the
doctor
,
"
we
must
keep
him
quiet

keep
the

cool

give
him
his

regularly

see

carefully
looked

all

<EOS>
"
And
as

said
Mrs

.
   
<EOS>
"
I

observed
Mrs

,
when
they
had
curtseyed
the
doctor
out
;
"
there

Nothin'

Mrs

<EOS>
An
unexpected
meeting
,
and
a
promising
prospect
 
<EOS>
The
laws
of
sympathy
between
beards
and
birds
,
and
the
secret
source
of
that
attraction
which
frequently
impels
a
shaver
of
the
one
to
be
a
dealer
in
the
other
,
are
questions
for
the
subtle
reasoning
of
scientific
bodies
;
not
the
less
so
,
because
their
investigation
would
seem
calculated
to
lead
to
no
particular
result
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
to
know
that
the
artist
who
had
the
honour
of
entertaining
Mrs
Gamp
as
his
first
-
floor
lodger
,
united
the
two
pursuits
of
barbering
and
bird
-
fancying
;
and
that
it
was
not
an
original
idea
of
his
,
but
one
in
which
he
had
,
dispersed
about
the
by
-
streets
and
suburbs
of
the
town
,
a
host
of
rivals
.
   
<EOS>
The
name
of
the
householder
was
Paul
Sweedlepipe
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
commonly
called
Poll
Sweedlepipe
;
and
was
not
uncommonly
believed
to
have
been
so
christened
,
among
his
friends
and
neighbours
.
   
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
the
staircase
,
and
his
lodger
's
private
apartment
,
Poll
Sweedlepipe
's
house
was
one
great
bird
's
nest
.
<EOS>
Gamecocks
resided
in
the
kitchen
;
pheasants
wasted
the
brightness
of
their
golden
plumage
on
the
garret
;
bantams
roosted
in
the
cellar
;
owls
had
possession
of
the
bedroom
;
and
specimens
of
all
the
smaller
fry
of
birds
chirrupped
and
twittered
in
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
The
staircase
was
sacred
to
rabbits
.
 
<EOS>
There
in
hutches
of
all
shapes
and
kinds
,
made
from
old
packing
-
cases
,
boxes
,
drawers
,
and
tea
-
chests
,
they
increased
in
a
prodigious
degree
,
and
contributed
their
share
towards
that
complicated
whiff
which
,
quite
impartially
,
and
without
distinction
of
persons
,
saluted
every
nose
that
was
put
into
Sweedlepipe
's
easy
shaving
-
shop
.
   
<EOS>
Many
noses
found
their
way
there
,
for
all
that
,
especially
on
Sunday
morning
,
before
church
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
Even
archbishops
shave
,
or
must
be
shaved
,
on
a
Sunday
,
and
beards
WILL
grow
after
twelve
o'clock
on
Saturday
night
,
though
it
be
upon
the
chins
of
base
mechanics
;
who
,
not
being
able
to
engage
their
valets
by
the
quarter
,
hire
them
by
the
job
,
and
pay
them
---
<EOS>
oh
,
the
wickedness
of
copper
coin
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
in
dirty
pence
.
 
<EOS>
Poll
Sweedlepipe
,
the
sinner
,
shaved
all
comers
at
a
penny
each
,
and
cut
the
hair
of
any
customer
for
twopence
;
and
being
a
lone
unmarried
man
,
and
having
some
connection
in
the
bird
line
,
Poll
got
on
tolerably
well
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
elderly
man
,
with
a
clammy
cold
right
hand
,
from
which
even
rabbits
and
birds
could
not
remove
the
smell
of
shaving
-
soap
.
 
<EOS>
Poll
had
something
of
the
bird
in
his
nature
;
not
of
the
hawk
or
eagle
,
but
of
the
sparrow
,
that
builds
in
chimney
-
stacks
and
inclines
to
human
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
quarrelsome
,
though
,
like
the
sparrow
;
but
peaceful
,
like
the
dove
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
walk
he
strutted
;
and
,
in
this
respect
,
he
bore
a
faint
resemblance
to
the
pigeon
,
as
well
as
in
a
certain
prosiness
of
speech
,
which
might
,
in
its
monotony
,
be
likened
to
the
cooing
of
that
bird
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
inquisitive
;
and
when
he
stood
at
his
shop
-
door
in
the
evening
-
tide
,
watching
the
neighbours
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
his
eye
cocked
knowingly
,
there
was
a
dash
of
the
raven
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
there
was
no
more
wickedness
in
Poll
than
in
a
robin
.
 
<EOS>
Happily
,
too
,
when
any
of
his
ornithological
properties
were
on
the
verge
of
going
too
far
,
they
were
quenched
,
dissolved
,
melted
down
,
and
neutralised
in
the
barber
;
just
as
his
bald
head
---
<EOS>
otherwise
,
as
the
head
of
a
shaved
magpie
---
 
lost
itself
in
a
wig
of
curly
black
ringlets
,
parted
on
one
side
,
and
cut
away
almost
to
the
crown
,
to
indicate
immense
capacity
of
intellect
.
   
<EOS>
Poll
had
a
very
small
,
shrill
treble
voice
,
which
might
have
led
the
wags
of
Kingsgate
Street
to
insist
the
more
upon
his
feminine
designation
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
tender
heart
,
too
;
for
,
when
he
had
a
good
commission
to
provide
three
or
four
score
sparrows
for
a
shooting
-
match
,
he
would
observe
,
in
a
compassionate
tone
,
how
singular
it
was
that
sparrows
should
have
been
made
expressly
for
such
purposes
.
<EOS>
The
question
,
whether
men
were
made
to
shoot
them
,
never
entered
into
Poll
's
philosophy
.
   
<EOS>
Poll
wore
,
in
his
sporting
character
,
a
velveteen
coat
,
a
great
deal
of
blue
stocking
,
ankle
boots
,
a
neckerchief
of
some
bright
colour
,
and
a
very
tall
hat
.
 
<EOS>
Pursuing
his
more
quiet
occupation
of
barber
,
he
generally
subsided
into
an
apron
not
over
-
clean
,
a
flannel
jacket
,
and
corduroy
knee
-
shorts
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
latter
costume
,
but
with
his
apron
girded
round
his
waist
,
as
a
token
of
his
having
shut
up
shop
for
the
night
,
that
he
closed
the
door
one
evening
,
some
weeks
after
the
occurrences
detailed
in
the
last
chapter
,
and
stood
upon
the
steps
in
Kingsgate
Street
,
listening
until
the
little
cracked
bell
within
should
leave
off
ringing
.
 
<EOS>
For
until
it
did
---
 
<EOS>
this
was
Mr
Sweedlepipe
's
reflection
---
the
place
never
seemed
quiet
enough
to
be
left
to
itself
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
greediest
little
bell
to
ring
,
"
said
Poll
,
"
that
ever
was
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
quiet
at
last
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
rolled
his
apron
up
a
little
tighter
as
he
said
these
words
,
and
hastened
down
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
turning
into
Holborn
,
he
ran
against
a
young
gentleman
in
a
livery
.
 
<EOS>
This
youth
was
bold
,
though
small
,
and
with
several
lively
expressions
of
displeasure
,
turned
upon
him
instantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
STOO
-
PID
!
"
cried
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
look
where
you
're
a
-
going
to
---
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
mind
where
you
're
a
-
coming
to
---
eh
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
your
eyes
was
made
for
---
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Now
then
!
<EOS>
"
   
The
young
gentleman
pronounced
the
two
last
words
in
a
very
loud
tone
and
with
frightful
emphasis
,
as
though
they
contained
within
themselves
the
essence
of
the
direst
aggravation
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
scarcely
done
so
,
when
his
anger
yielded
to
surprise
,
and
he
cried
,
in
a
milder
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Polly
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
Why
,
it
an't
you
,
sure
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
It
an't
me
,
"
returned
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
son
,
my
oldest
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
credit
to
his
father
,
an't
<EOS>
he
,
Polly
?
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
delicate
little
piece
of
banter
,
he
halted
on
the
pavement
,
and
went
round
and
round
in
circles
,
for
the
better
exhibition
of
his
figure
;
rather
to
the
inconvenience
of
the
passengers
generally
,
who
were
not
in
an
equal
state
of
spirits
with
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
have
believed
it
,
"
said
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
You
've
left
your
old
place
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
!
"
returned
his
young
friend
,
who
had
by
this
time
stuck
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
white
cord
breeches
,
and
was
swaggering
along
at
the
barber
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
D'ye
know
a
pair
of
top
-
boots
when
you
see
'em
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
---
look
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beau
-
ti

cried
Mr
Sweedlepipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
D'ye
know
a
slap
-
up
sort
of
button
,
when
you
see
it
?
"
said
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
at
mine
,
if
you
ai
n't
a
judge
,
because
these
lions
'
heads
was
made
for
men

taste

not
snobs

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beau
-
ti

<EOS>
"
cried
the
barber
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
grass
-
green
frock
-
coat
,
too
,
bound
with
gold
;
and
a
cockade
in
your
hat

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
so
,
"
replied
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blow
the
cockade
,
though
;
for
,
except
that
it
do
n't
turn
round
,
it
's
like
the
wentilator
that
used
to
be
in
the
kitchen
winder
at
Todgers
's
.
 
<EOS>
You
ai
n't

old
lady
's
name
in
the
Gazette

"
   
<EOS>
"
No

returned
the
barber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
she
a
bankrupt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
she
ai
n't

she

retorted
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
bis'ness
never
can
be
carried
on
without
ME

<EOS>
Well

How
are

?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
I
'm
pretty
well

said
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
living
at
this
end
of
the
town
,
or
were
you
coming
to
see
me

<EOS>
Was
that
the
bis'ness
that
brought
you
to
Holborn
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
got
no
bis'ness
in
Holborn
,
"
returned
Bailey
,
with
some
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
my
bis'ness
lays
at
the
West
End
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
got
the
right
sort
of
governor
now

<EOS>
You
ca
n't
see
his
face
for

whiskers

and
ca

see

<EOS>
That

<EOS>
You
would
n't
like

ride
in
a
cab

would
you

<EOS>
Why

it
would
n't
be
safe

offer
it

<EOS>
You
'd
faint
away

only
to
see
me
a

comin

at
a
mild
trot
round
the
corner

"
   
<EOS>
To
convey
a
slight
idea
of
the
effect
of
this
approach
,
Mr
Bailey
counterfeited
in
his
own
person
the
action
of
a
high
-
trotting
horse
and
threw
up
his
head
so
high
,
in
backing
against
a
pump
,
that
he
shook
his
hat
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
's
own
uncle
to
Capricorn
,
"
said
Bailey
,
"
and
brother
to
Cauliflower

<EOS>
He
's
been
through
the
winders
of
two
chaney
shops
since
we
've
had
him
,
and
was

<EOS>
"
Ah

<EOS>
you
'll
never
want
to
buy
any
more
red

"
observed
Poll
,
looking
on
his
young
friend
with
an
air
of
melancholy
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
never
want

buy
any
more
red

hang
up

you

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not

"
replied
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Reether
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
nothin'

<EOS>
Well

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
I
'm
pretty
well

"
said
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
He
answered
the
question
again
because
Mr
Bailey
asked
it
again
;
Mr
Bailey
asked
it
again
,
because
 
---
accompanied
with
a
straddling
action
of
the
white
cords
,
a
bend
of
the
knees
,
and
<EOS>
a
striking
forth
of
the
top
-
boots
---
it
was
an
easy
horse
-
fleshy
,
turfy
sort
of
thing
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
are
you
up
to
,
old
feller
?
<EOS>
"
added
Mr
Bailey
,
with
the
same
graceful
rakishness
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
quite
the
man
-
about
-
town
of
the
conversation
,
while
the
easy
-
shaver
was
the
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
am
going
to
fetch
my
lodger
home
,
"
said
Paul
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
woman
!
"
cried
Mr
Bailey
,
"
for
a
twenty
-
pun
"
note
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
little
barber
hastened
to
explain
that
she
was
neither
a
young
woman
,
nor
a
handsome
woman
,
but
a
nurse
,
who
had
been
acting
as
a
kind
of
house
-
keeper
to
a
gentleman
for
some
weeks
past
,
and
left
her
place
that
night
,
in
consequence
of
being
superseded
by
another
and
a
more
legitimate
house
-
keeper
---
to
wit
,
the
gentleman
's
bride
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
newly
married
,
and
he
brings
his
young
wife
home
to

night

"
said
the
barber
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
'm
going
to
fetch
my
lodger
away
---
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
's
,
close
behind
the
Post
Office
---
and
carry
her
box
for
her

"
   
<EOS>
"
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
's
?
"
said
Bailey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
returned
Paul
:
"
<EOS>
that
's
the
name
sure
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
"
cried
Mr
Bailey
;
"
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
know
her
!
 
<EOS>
Not
neither
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
they
first
kept
company
through
me
,
a'most
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
?
"
said
Paul
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Bailey
,
with
a
wink
;
"
and
she
ai
n't
bad
<EOS>
looking
mind
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
sister
was
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
SHE
was
the
merry
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
used
to
have
a
bit
of
fun
with
her
,
in
the
hold
times
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
spoke
as
if
he
already
had
a
leg
and
three
-
quarters
in
the
grave
,
and
this
had
happened
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Paul
Sweedlepipe
,
the
meek
,
was
so
perfectly
confounded
by
his
precocious
self
-
possession
,
and
his
patronizing
manner
,
as
well
as
by
his
boots
,
cockade
,
and
livery
,
that
a
mist
swam
before
his
eyes
,
and
he
saw
---
not
the
Bailey
of
acknowledged
juvenility
from
Todgers
's
Commercial
Boarding
House
,
who
had
made
his
acquaintance
within
a
twelvemonth
,
by
purchasing
,
at
sundry
times
,
small
birds
at
twopence
each
---
but
a
highly
-
condensed
embodiment
of
all
the
sporting
grooms
in
London
;
an
abstract
of
all
the
stable
-
knowledge
of
the
time
;
a
something
at
a
high
-
pressure
that
must
have
had
existence
many
years
,
and
was
fraught
with
terrible
experiences
.
 
<EOS>
And
truly
,
though
in
the
cloudy
atmosphere
of
Todgers
's
,
Mr
Bailey
's
genius
had
ever
shone
out
brightly
in
this
particular
respect
<EOS>
,
it
now
eclipsed
both
time
and
space
,
cheated
beholders
of
their
senses
,
and
worked
on
their
belief
in
defiance
of
all
natural
laws
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
along
the
tangible
and
real
stones
of
Holborn
Hill
,
an
undersized
boy
;
and
yet
he
winked
the
winks
,
and
thought
the
thoughts
,
and
did
the
deeds
,
and
said
the
sayings
of
an
ancient
man
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
principle
within
him
,
and
a
young
surface
without
.
 
<EOS>
He
became
an
inexplicable
creature
;
a
breeched
and
booted
Sphinx
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
course
open
to
the
barber
,
but
to
go
distracted
himself
,
or
to
take
Bailey
for
granted
;
and
he
wisely
chose
the
latter
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
was
good
enough
to
continue
to
bear
him
company
,
and
to
entertain
him
,
as
they
went
,
with
easy
conversation
on
various
sporting
topics
;
especially
on
the
comparative
merits
,
as
a
general
principle
,
of
horses
with
white
stockings
,
and
horses
without
.
 
<EOS>
In
regard
to
the
style
of
tail
to
be
preferred
,
Mr
Bailey
had
opinions
of
his
own
,
which
he
explained
,
but
begged
they
might
by
no
means
influence
his
friend
's
,
as
here
he
knew
he
had
the
misfortune
to
differ
from
some
excellent
authorities
.
 
<EOS>
He
treated
Mr
Sweedlepipe
to
a
dram
,
compounded
agreeably
to
his
own
directions
,
which
he
informed
him
had
been
invented
by
a
member
of
the
Jockey
Club
;
and
,
as
they
were
by
this
time
near
the
barber
's
destination
,
he
observed
that
,
as
he
had
an
hour
to
spare
,
and
knew
the
parties
,
he
would
,
if
quite
agreeable
,
be
introduced
to
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
Paul
knocked
at
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
's
;
and
,
on
the
door
being
opened
by
that
lady
,
made
the
two
distinguished
persons
known
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
happy
feature
in
Mrs
Gamp
's
twofold
profession
,
that
it
gave
her
an
interest
in
everything
that
was
young
as
well
as
in
everything
that
was
old
.
 
<EOS>
She
received
Mr
Bailey
with
much
kindness
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
good
,
I
'm
sure
,
of
you
to
come
,
"
she
said
to
her
landlord
,
"
as
well
as
bring
so
nice
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
afraid
that
I
must
trouble
you
so
far
as
to
step
in
,
for
the
young
couple
has
not
yet
made
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
late
,
ai
n't
they
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
her
landlord
,
when
she
had
conducted
them
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
considern
"
the
Wings
of
Love
,
they
are
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
inquired
whether
the
Wings
of
Love
had
ever
won
a
plate
,
or
could
be
backed
to
do
anything
remarkable
;
and
being
informed
that
it
was
not
a
horse
,
but
merely
a
poetical
or
figurative
expression
,
evinced
considerable
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
was
so
very
much
astonished
by
his
affable
manners
and
great
ease
,
that
she
was
about
to
propound
to
her
landlord
in
a
whisper
the
staggering
inquiry
,
whether
he
was
a
man
or
a
boy
,
when
Mr
Sweedlepipe
,
anticipating
her
design
,
made
a
timely
diversion
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
knows
Mrs
Chuzzlewit
,
"
said
Paul
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothin'
he
do
n't
know
;
that
's
my
opinion
,
"
observed
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
the
wickedness
of
the
world
is
Print
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
received
this
as
a
compliment
,
and
said
,
adjusting
his
cravat
,
"
reether
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
you
knows
Mrs
Chuzzlewit
,
you
knows
,
p'raps
,
what
her
chris'en
name
is
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charity
,
"
said
Bailey
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
it
ai
n't
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cherry
,
then
,
"
said
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cherry
's
short
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
do
n't
begin
with
a
C^
at
all
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Gamp
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
begins
with
a
M^.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whew
!
"
cried
Mr
Bailey
,
slapping
a
little
cloud
of
pipe
-
clay
out
of
his
left
leg
,
"
then
he
's
been
and
married
the
merry
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
these
words
were
mysterious
,
Mrs
Gamp
called
upon
him
to
explain
,
which
Mr
Bailey
proceeded
to
do
;
that
lady
listening
greedily
to
everything
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
yet
in
the
fullness
of
his
narrative
when
the
sound
of
wheels
,
and
a
double
knock
at
the
street
door
,
announced
the
arrival
of
the
newly
married
couple
.
 
<EOS>
Begging
him
to
reserve
what
more
he
had
to
say
for
her
hearing
on
the
way
home
,
Mrs
Gamp
took
up
the
candle
,
and
hurried
away
to
receive
and
welcome
the
young
mistress
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wishing
you
appiness
and
joy
with
all
my
art
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
dropping
a
curtsey
as
they
entered
the
hall
;
"
and
you
,
too
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Your
lady
looks
a
little
tired
with
the
journey
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
a
pretty
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
bothered
enough
about
it
,
"
grumbled
Mr
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
show
a
light
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
way
,
ma'am
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
going
upstairs
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Things
has
been
made
as
comfortable
as
they
could
be
,
but
there
's
many
things
you
'll
have
to
alter
your
own
self
when
you
gets
time
to
look
about
you
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
sweet
thing
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
do
n't
,
"
added
Mrs
Gamp
,
internally
,
"
<EOS>
you
do
n't
look
much
like
a
merry
one
,
I
must
say
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
true
;
she
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
The
death
that
had
gone
before
the
bridal
seemed
to
have
left
its
shade
upon
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
was
heavy
and
oppressive
;
the
rooms
were
dark
;
a
deep
gloom
filled
up
every
chink
and
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
hearthstone
,
like
a
creature
of
ill
omen
,
sat
the
aged
clerk
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
some
withered
branches
in
the
stove
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
and
looked
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
there
you
are
,
Mr
Chuff
,
"
said
Jonas
carelessly
,
as
he
dusted
his
boots
;
"
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Still
in
the
land
of
the
living
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
Mr
Chuffey
may
thank
you
for
it
,
as
many
and
many
a
time
I
've
told
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
was
not
in
the
best
of
humours
,
for
he
merely
said
,
as
he
looked
round
,
"
We
do
n't
want
you
any
more
,
you
know
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
going
immediate
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
nurse
;
"
unless
there
's
nothink
I
can
do
for
you
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
there
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
a
look
of
great
sweetness
,
and
rummaging
all
the
time
in
her
pocket
;
"
ai
n't
there
nothink
I
can
do
for
you
,
my
little
bird
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Merry
,
almost
crying
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
away
,
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
leer
of
mingled
sweetness
and
slyness
;
with
one
eye
on
the
future
,
one
on
the
bride
,
and
an
arch
expression
in
her
face
,
partly
spiritual
,
partly
spirituous
,
and
wholly
professional
and
peculiar
to
her
art
;
Mrs
Gamp
rummaged
in
her
pocket
again
,
and
took
from
it
a
printed
card
,
whereon
was
an
inscription
copied
from
her
signboard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
be
so
good
,
my
darling
dovey
of
a
dear
young
married
lady

"
Mrs
Gamp
observed
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
as
put
that
somewheres
where
you
can
keep
it
in
your
mind
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
well
beknown
to
many
ladies

and
it
's
my
card

<EOS>
Gamp

my

Gamp
my
nater

<EOS>
Livin

quite
handy

I
will
make
so
bold

and
then
,
and
make
inquiry
how
your
health
and
spirits
is

my
precious
chick

"
   
<EOS>
And
with
innumerable
leers
,
winks
,
coughs
,
nods
,
smiles
,
and
curtseys
,
all
leading
to
the
establishment
of
a
mysterious
and
confidential
understanding
between
herself
and
the
bride
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
invoking
a
blessing
upon
the
house
,
leered
,
winked
,
coughed
,
nodded
,
smiled
,
and
curtseyed
herself
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
say
,
and
<EOS>
I
would
if
I
was
led
a
Martha
to
the
Stakes
for
it
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
remarked
below
stairs
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
that
she
do
n't
look
much
like
a
merry
one
at
this
present
moment
of
time

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
wait
till
you
hear
her
laugh
!
"
said
Bailey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
in
a
kind
of
groan
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
said
no
more
in
the
house
,
for
Mrs
Gamp
put
on
her
bonnet
,
Mr
Sweedlepipe
took
up
her
box
;
and
Mr
Bailey
accompanied
them
towards
Kingsgate
Street
;
recounting
to
Mrs
Gamp
as
they
went
along
,
the
origin
and
progress
of
his
acquaintance
with
Mrs
Chuzzlewit
and
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
pleasant
instance
of
this
youth
's
precocity
,
that
he
fancied
Mrs
Gamp
had
conceived
a
tenderness
for
him
,
and
was
much
tickled
by
her
misplaced
attachment
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
door
closed
heavily
behind
them
,
Mrs
Jonas
sat
down
in
a
chair
,
and
felt
a
strange
chill
creep
upon
her
,
whilst
she
looked
about
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
much
as
she
had
known
it
,
but
appeared
more
dreary
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
thought
to
see
it
brightened
to
receive
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
good
enough
for
you
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Jonas
,
watching
her
looks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
IS
dull
,
"
said
Merry
,
trying
to
be
more
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
duller
before
you
're
done
with
it
,
"
retorted
Jonas
,
"
if
you
give
me
any
of
your
airs
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
nice
article
,
to
turn
sulky
on
first
coming
home
!
 
<EOS>
Ecod
,
you
used
to
have
life
enough
,
when
you
could
plague
me
with
it

<EOS>
The
gal
's
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Ring
the
bell
for
supper
,
while
I
take
my
boots
off
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
roused
herself
from
looking
after
him
as
he
left
the
room
,
to
do
what
he
had
desired
;
when
the
old
man
Chuffey
laid
his
hand
softly
on
her
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
married
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
married
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
A
month
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
answered
nothing
was
the
matter
;
and
turned
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
her
fear
and
wonder
,
turning
also
,
she
saw
him
raise
his
trembling
hands
above
his
head
,
and
heard
him
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
woe
,
woe
,
woe
,
upon
this
wicked
house
!

It
was

welcome

Mr
Bailey
,
Junior
---
for
the
sporting
character
,
whilom
of
general
utility
at
Todgers
's
,
had
now
regularly
set
up
in
life
under
that
name
,
without
troubling
himself
to
obtain
from
the
legislature
a
direct
licence
in
the
form
of
a
Private
Bill
,
which
of
all
kinds
and
classes
of
bills
is
without
exception
the
most
unreasonable
in
its
charges
---
Mr
Bailey
,
Junior
,
just
tall
enough
to
be
seen
by
an
inquiring
eye
,
gazing
indolently
at
society
from
beneath
the
apron
of
his
master
's
cab
,
drove
slowly
up
and
down
Pall
Mall
,
about
the
hour
of
noon
,
in
waiting
for
his
"
Governor
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
horse
of
distinguished
family
,
who
had
Capricorn
for
his
nephew
,
and
Cauliflower
for
his
brother
,
showed
himself
worthy
of
his
high
relations
by
champing
at
the
bit
until
his
chest
was
white
with
foam
,
and
rearing
like
a
horse
in
heraldry
;
the
plated
harness
and
the
patent
leather
glittered
in
the
sun
;
pedestrians
admired
;
Mr
Bailey
was
complacent
,
but
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
say
,
"
A
barrow
,
good
people
,
a
mere
barrow
;
nothing
to
what
we
could
do
,
if
we
chose
!
"
<EOS>
and
on
he
went
,
squaring
his
short
green
arms
outside
the
apron
,
as
if
he
were
hooked
on
to
it
by
his
armpits
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
had
a
great
opinion
of
Brother
to
Cauliflower
,
and
estimated
his
powers
highly
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
never
told
him
so
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
was
his
practice
,
in
driving
that
animal
,
to
assail
him
with
disrespectful
,
if
not
injurious
,
expressions
,
as
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
would
you
!
"
<EOS>
"
Did
you
think
it
,
then
?
"
"
Where
are
you
going
to
now
?
"
"
No
,
you
wo
n't
,
my
lad
!
"
and
similar
fragmentary
remarks
.
 
<EOS>
These
being
usually
accompanied
by
a
jerk
of
the
rein
,
or
a
crack
of
the
whip
,
led
to
many
trials
of
strength
between
them
,
and
to
many
contentions
for
the
upper
-
hand
,
terminating
,
now
and
then
,
in
china
-
shops
,
and
other
unusual
goals
,
as
Mr
Bailey
had
already
hinted
to
his
friend
Poll
Sweedlepipe
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
Mr
Bailey
,
being
in
spirits
,
was
more
than
commonly
hard
upon
his
charge
;
in
consequence
of
which
that
fiery
animal
confined
himself
almost
entirely
to
his
hind
legs
in
displaying
his
paces
,
and
constantly
got
himself
into
positions
with
reference
to
the
cabriolet
that
very
much
amazed
the
passengers
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Bailey
,
not
at
all
disturbed
,
had
still
a
shower
of
pleasantries
to
bestow
on
any
one
who
crossed
his
path
;
as
,
calling
to
a
full
-
grown
coal
-
heaver
in
a
wagon
,
who
for
a
moment
blocked
the
way
,
"
Now
,
young
'
un
,
who
trusted
YOU
with
a
cart
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
inquiring
of
elderly
ladies
who
wanted
to
cross
,
and
ran
back
again
,
"
Why
they
did
n't
go
to
the
workhouse
and
get
an
order
to
be
buried
?
"
<EOS>
tempting
boys
,
with
friendly
words
,
to
get
up
behind
,
and
immediately
afterwards
cutting
them
down
;
and
the
like
flashes
of
a
cheerful
humour
,
which
he
would
occasionally
relieve
by
going
round
St.
James
's
Square
at
a
hand
gallop
,
and
coming
slowly
into
Pall
Mall
by
another
entry
,
as
if
,
in
the
interval
,
his
pace
had
been
a
perfect
crawl
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
these
amusements
had
been
very
often
repeated
,
and
the
apple
-
stall
at
the
corner
had
sustained
so
many
miraculous
escapes
as
to
appear
impregnable
,
that
Mr
Bailey
was
summoned
to
the
door
of
a
certain
house
in
Pall
Mall
,
and
turning
short
,
obeyed
the
call
and
jumped
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
had
held
the
bridle
for
some
minutes
longer
,
every
jerk
of
Cauliflower
's
brother
's
head
,
and
every
twitch
of
Cauliflower
's
brother
's
nostril
,
taking
him
off
his
legs
in
the
meanwhile
,
that
two
persons
entered
the
vehicle
,
one
of
whom
took
the
reins
and
drove
rapidly
off
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
until
Mr
Bailey
had
run
after
it
some
hundreds
of
yards
in
vain
,
that
he
managed
to
lift
his
short
leg
into
the
iron
step
,
and
finally
to
get
his
boots
upon
the
little
footboard
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
indeed
,
he
became
a
sight
to
see
;
and
---
standing
now
on
one
foot
and
now
upon
the
other
,
now
trying
to
look
round
the
cab
on
this
side
,
now
on
that
,
and
now
endeavouring
to
peep
over
the
top
of
it
,
as
it
went
dashing
in
among
the
carts
and
coaches
---
was
from
head
to
heel
Newmarket
.
   
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
Mr
Bailey
's
governor
as
he
drove
along
fully
justified
that
enthusiastic
youth
's
description
of
him
to
the
wondering
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
world
of
jet
-
black
shining
hair
upon
his
head
,
upon
his
cheeks
,
upon
his
chin
,
upon
his
upper
lip
.
 
<EOS>
His
clothes
,
symmetrically
made
,
were
of
the
newest
fashion
and
the
costliest
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Flowers
of
gold
and
blue
,
and
green
and
blushing
red
,
were
on
his
waistcoat
;
precious
chains
and
jewels
sparkled
on
his
breast
;
his
fingers
,
clogged
with
brilliant
rings
,
were
as
unwieldly
as
summer
flies
but
newly
rescued
from
a
honey
-
pot
.
 
<EOS>
The
daylight
mantled
in
his
gleaming
hat
and
boots
as
in
a
polished
glass
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
though
changed
his
name
,
and
changed
his
outward
surface
,
it
was
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
Though
turned
and
twisted
upside
down
,
and
inside
out
,
as
great
men
have
been
sometimes
known
to
be
;
though
no
longer
Montague
Tigg
,
but
Tigg
Montague
;
still
it
was
Tigg
;
the
same
Satanic
,
gallant
,
military
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
The
brass
was
burnished
,
lacquered
,
newly
stamped
;
yet
it
was
the
true
Tigg
metal
notwithstanding
.
   
<EOS>
Beside
him
sat
a
smiling
gentleman
,
of
less
pretensions
and
of
business
looks
,
whom
he
addressed
as
David
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
not
the
David
of
the
---
how
shall
it
be
phrased
?
---
the
triumvirate
of
golden
balls
?
 
<EOS>
Not
David
,
tapster
at
the
Lombards
'
Arms
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
secretary
's
salary
,
David
,
"
said
Mr
Montague
,
"
the
office
being
now
established
,
is
eight
hundred
pounds
per
annum
,
with
his
house
-
rent
,
coals
,
and
candles
free
.
 
<EOS>
His
five
-
and
-
twenty
shares
he
holds
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
enough
?
"
   
<EOS>
David
smiled
and
nodded
,
and
coughed
behind
a
little
locked
portfolio
which
he
carried
;
with
an
air
that
proclaimed
him
to
be
the
secretary
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
that
's
enough
,
"
said
Montague
,
"
I
will
propose
it
at
the
Board
to
-
day
,
in
my
capacity
as
chairman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
secretary
smiled
again
;
laughed
,
indeed
,
this
time
;
and
said
,
rubbing
his
nose
slily
with
one
end
of
the
portfolio
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
capital
thought
,
was
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
a
capital
thought
,
David
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Anglo
-
Bengalee
,
"
tittered
the
secretary
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
Company
is
rather
a
capital
concern
,
I
hope
,
David
,
"
said
Montague
.
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
indeed
!
"
cried
the
secretary
,
with
another
laugh
---
"
in
one
sense
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
only
important
one
,
"
observed
the
chairman
;
"
which
is
number
one
,
David
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
asked
the
secretary
,
bursting
into
another
laugh
,
"
what
will
be
the
paid
up
capital
,
according
to
the
next
prospectus
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
figure
of
two
,
and
as
many
oughts
after
it
as
the
printer
can
get
into
the
same
line
,
"
replied
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
!
"
   
At
this
they
both
laughed
;
the
secretary
so
vehemently
,
that
in
kicking
up
his
feet
,
he
kicked
the
apron
open
,
and
nearly
started
Cauliflower
's
brother
into
an
oyster
shop
;
not
to
mention
Mr
Bailey
's
receiving
such
a
sudden
swing
,
that
he
held
on
for
a
moment
quite
a
young
Fame
,
by
one
strap
and
no
legs
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
chap
you
are
!
"
exclaimed
David
admiringly
,
when
this
little
alarm
had
subsided
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
,
genius
,
David
,
genius
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Well
,
upon
my
soul
,
you
ARE
a
genius
then
,
"
said
David
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
knew
you
had
the
gift
of
the
gab
,
of
course
;
but
I
never
believed
you
were
half
the
man
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
?
"
   
"
I
rise
with
circumstances
,
David
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
point
of
genius
in
itself
,
"
said
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
to
lose
a
hundred
pound
wager
to
me
at
this
minute
David
,
and
were
to
pay
it
(
<EOS>
which
is
most
confoundedly
improbable
)
,
I
should
rise
,
in
a
mental
point
of
view
,
directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
due
to
Mr
Tigg
to
say
that
he
had
really
risen
with
his
opportunities
;
and
,
peculating
on
a
grander
scale
,
he
had
become
a
grander
man
altogether
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
"
cried
the
secretary
,
laying
his
hand
,
with
growing
familiarity
,
upon
the
chairman
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
look
at
you
,
and
think
of
your
property
in
Bengal
being
---
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
---
"
   
The
half
-
expressed
idea
seemed
no
less
ludicrous
to
Mr
Tigg
than
to
his
friend
,
for
he
laughed
too
,
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
Being
,
"
resumed
David
,
"
being
amenable
---
<EOS>
your
property
in
Bengal
being
amenable

to
all
claims
upon
the
company
;
when
I
look
at
you
and
think
of
that
,
you
might
tickle
me
into
fits
by
waving
the
feather
of
a
pen
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
you
might
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
a
devilish
fine
property
,
"
said
Tigg
Montague
,
"
to
be
amenable
to
any
claims
.
 
<EOS>
The
preserve
of
tigers
alone
is
worth
a
mint
of
money
,
David
.
"
   
<EOS>
David
could
only
reply
in
the
intervals
of
his
laughter
,
"
Oh
,
what
a
chap
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
continued
to
laugh
,
and
hold
his
sides
,
and
wipe
his
eyes
,
for
some
time
,
without
offering
any
other
observation
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
capital
idea
?
"
said
Tigg
,
returning
after
a
time
to
his
companion
's
first
remark
;
"
no
doubt
it
was
a
capital
idea
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
my
idea
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
my
idea
,
"
said
David
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hang
it
,
let
a
man
have
some
credit
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
say
to
you
that
I
'd
saved
a
few
pounds
?
---
"
   
"
You
said
!
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
say
to
you
,
"
interposed
Tigg
,
"
that
I
had
come
into
a
few
pounds
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
you
did
,
"
returned
David
,
warmly
,
"
but
that
's
not
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
Who
said
,
that
if
we
put
the
money
together
we
could
furnish
an
office
,
and
make
a
show
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
who
said
,
"
retorted
Mr
Tigg
,
"
that
,
provided
we
did
it
on
a
sufficiently
large
scale
,
we
could
furnish
an
office
and
make
a
show
,
without
any
money
at
all

<EOS>
Be
rational

and
tell
me
whose
idea
was
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
,
"
David
was
obliged
to
confess
,
"
you
had
the
advantage
of
me
,
I
admit
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
put
myself
on
a
level
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
want
a
little
credit
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
the
credit
you
deserve
to
have
,
"
said
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
plain
work
of
the
company
,
David
---
figures
,
books
,
circulars
,
advertisements
,
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
sealing

wax
and
wafers
---
is
admirably
done
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
first

rate
groveller
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
dispute
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
ornamental
department
,
David
;
the
inventive
and
poetical
department
---
"
   
"
Is
entirely
yours
,
"
said
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
question
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
such
a
swell
turnout
as
this
,
and
all
the
handsome
things
you
've
got
about
you
,
and
the
life
you
lead
,
I
mean
to
say
it
's
a
precious
comfortable
department
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
it
gain
the
purpose
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
Anglo
-
Bengalee
?
"
asked
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
David
.
   
<EOS>
"
Could
you
undertake
it
yourself
?
"
demanded
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
David
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
be
contented
with
your
station
and
your
profits
,
David
,
my
fine
fellow
,
and
bless
the
day
that
made
us
acquainted
across
the
counter
of
our
common
uncle
,
for
it
was
a
golden
day
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
will
have
been
already
gathered
from
the
conversation
of
these
worthies
,
that
they
were
embarked
in
an
enterprise
of
some
magnitude
,
in
which
they
addressed
the
public
in
general
from
the
strong
position
of
having
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
at
all
to
lose
;
and
which
,
based
upon
this
great
principle
,
was
thriving
pretty
comfortably
.
   
<EOS>
The
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
Company
started
into
existence
one
morning
,
not
an
Infant
Institution
,
but
a
Grown
-
up
Company
running
alone
at
a
great
pace
,
and
doing
business
right
and
left
:
with
a
"
branch
"
in
a
first
floor
over
a
tailor
's
at
the
west
-
end
of
the
town
,
and
main
offices
in
a
new
street
in
the
City
,
comprising
the
upper
part
of
a
spacious
house
resplendent
in
stucco
and
plate
-
glass
,
with
wire
-
blinds
in
all
the
windows
,
and
"
Anglo
-
Bengalee
"
worked
into
the
pattern
of
every
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
doorpost
was
painted
again
in
large
letters
,
"
offices
of
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
Company
,
"
and
on
the
door
was
a
large
brass
plate
with
the
same
inscription
;
always
kept
very
bright
,
as
courting
inquiry
;
staring
the
City
out
of
countenance
after
office
hours
on
working
days
,
and
all
day
long
on
Sundays
;
and
looking
bolder
than
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
Within
,
the
offices
were
newly
plastered
,
newly
painted
,
newly
papered
,
newly
countered
,
newly
floor
-
clothed
,
newly
tabled
,
newly
chaired
,
newly
fitted
up
in
every
way
,
with
goods
that
were
substantial
and
expensive
,
and
designed
(
like
the
company
)
to
last
.
 
<EOS>
Business
!
 
<EOS>
Look
at
the
green
ledgers
with
red
backs
,
like
strong
cricket
-
balls
beaten
flat
;
the
court
-
guides
directories
,
day
-
books
,
almanacks
,
letter
-
boxes
,
weighing
-
machines
for
letters
,
rows
of
fire
-
buckets
for
dashing
out
a
conflagration
in
its
first
spark
,
and
saving
the
immense
wealth
in
notes
and
bonds
belonging
to
the
company
;
look
at
the
iron
safes
,
the
clock
,
the
office
seal
---
in
its
capacious
self
,
security
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Solidity
!
 
<EOS>
Look
at
the
massive
blocks
of
marble
in
the
chimney
-
pieces
,
and
the
gorgeous
parapet
on
the
top
of
the
house
!
<EOS>
Publicity
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
company
is
painted
on
the
very
coal
-
scuttles
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
repeated
at
every
turn
until
the
eyes
are
dazzled
with
it
,
and
the
head
is
giddy
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
engraved
upon
the
top
of
all
the
letter
paper
,
and
it
makes
a
scroll
-
work
round
the
seal
,
and
it
shines
out
of
the
porter
's
buttons
,
and
it
is
repeated
twenty
times
in
every
circular
and
public
notice
wherein
one
David
Crimple
,
Esquire
,
Secretary
and
resident
Director
,
takes
the
liberty
of
inviting
your
attention
to
the
accompanying
statement
of
the
advantages
offered
by
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
Company
;
and
fully
proves
to
you
that
any
connection
on
your
part
with
that
establishment
must
result
in
a
perpetual
Christmas
Box
and
constantly
increasing
Bonus
to
yourself
,
and
that
nobody
can
run
any
risk
by
the
transaction
except
the
office
,
which
,
in
its
great
liberality
is
pretty
sure
to
lose
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
,
David
Crimple
,
Esquire
,
submits
to
you
(
and
the
odds
are
heavy
you
believe
him
)
<EOS>
,
is
the
best
guarantee
that
can
reasonably
be
suggested
by
the
Board
of
Management
for
its
permanence
and
stability
.
   
<EOS>
This
gentleman
's
name
,
by
the
way
,
had
been
originally
Crimp
;
but
as
the
word
was
susceptible
of
an
awkward
construction
and
might
be
misrepresented
,
he
had
altered
it
to
Crimple
.
   
<EOS>
Lest
with
all
these
proofs
and
confirmations
,
any
man
should
be
suspicious
of
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
company
;
should
doubt
in
tiger
,
cab
,
or
person
,
Tigg
Montague
,
Esquire
,
(
of
Pall
Mall
and
Bengal
)
,
or
any
other
name
in
the
imaginative
List
of
Directors
;
there
was
a
porter
on
the
premises
---
a
wonderful
creature
,
in
a
vast
red
waistcoat
and
a
short
-
tailed
pepper
-
and
-
salt
coat
---
who
carried
more
conviction
to
the
minds
of
sceptics
than
the
whole
establishment
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
No
confidences
existed
between
him
and
the
Directorship
;
nobody
knew
where
he
had
served
last
;
no
character
or
explanation
had
been
given
or
required
.
 
<EOS>
No
questions
had
been
asked
on
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
This
mysterious
being
,
relying
solely
on
his
figure
,
had
applied
for
the
situation
,
and
had
been
instantly
engaged
on
his
own
terms
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
high
;
but
he
knew
,
doubtless
,
that
no
man
could
carry
such
an
extent
of
waistcoat
as
himself
,
and
felt
the
full
value
of
his
capacity
to
such
an
institution
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
sat
upon
a
seat
erected
for
him
in
a
corner
of
the
office
,
with
his
glazed
hat
hanging
on
a
peg
over
his
head
,
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
the
respectability
of
the
concern
.
 
<EOS>
It
went
on
doubling
itself
with
every
square
inch
of
his
red
waistcoat
until
,
like
the
problem
of
the
nails
in
the
horse
's
shoes
,
the
total
became
enormous
.
 
<EOS>
People
had
been
known
to
apply
to
effect
an
insurance
on
their
lives
for
a
thousand
pounds
,
and
looking
at
him
,
to
beg
,
before
the
form
of
proposal
was
filled
up
,
that
it
might
be
made
two
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
was
not
a
giant
.
 
<EOS>
His
coat
was
rather
small
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
charm
was
in
his
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
Respectability
,
competence
,
property
in
Bengal
or
anywhere
else
,
responsibility
to
any
amount
on
the
part
of
the
company
that
employed
him
,
were
all
expressed
in
that
one
garment
.
   
<EOS>
Rival
offices
had
endeavoured
to
lure
him
away
;
Lombard
Street
itself
had
beckoned
to
him
;
rich
companies
had
whispered
"
Be
a
Beadle
!
"
<EOS>
but
he
still
continued
faithful
to
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
was
a
deep
rogue
,
or
a
stately
simpleton
,
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
,
but
he
appeared
to
believe
in
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
grave
with
imaginary
cares
of
office
;
and
having
nothing
whatever
to
do
,
and
something
less
to
take
care
of
,
would
look
as
if
the
pressure
of
his
numerous
duties
,
and
a
sense
of
the
treasure
in
the
company
's
strong
-
room
,
made
him
a
solemn
and
a
thoughtful
man
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
cabriolet
drove
up
to
the
door
,
this
officer
appeared
bare
-
headed
on
the
pavement
,
crying
aloud
"
Room
for
the
chairman
,
room
for
the
chairman
,
if
you
please
!
"
<EOS>
much
to
the
admiration
of
the
bystanders
,
who
,
it
is
needless
to
say
,
had
their
attention
directed
to
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Company
thenceforth
,
by
that
means
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
leaped
gracefully
out
,
followed
by
the
Managing
Director
(
who
was
by
this
time
very
distant
and
respectful
)
,
and
ascended
the
stairs
,
still
preceded
by
the
porter
,
who
cried
as
he
went
,
"
By
your
leave
there
!
<EOS>
by
your
leave
!
 
<EOS>
The
Chairman
of
the
Board
,
Gentle
---
MEN
!
 
<EOS>
In
like
manner
,
but
in
a
still
more
stentorian
voice
,
he
ushered
the
chairman
through
the
public
office
,
where
some
humble
clients
were
transacting
business
,
into
an
awful
chamber
,
labelled
Board
-
room
;
the
door
of
which
sanctuary
immediately
closed
,
and
screened
the
great
capitalist
from
vulgar
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
The
board
-
room
had
a
Turkey
carpet
in
it
,
a
sideboard
,
a
portrait
of
Tigg
Montague
,
Esquire
,
as
chairman
;
a
very
imposing
chair
of
office
,
garnished
with
an
ivory
hammer
and
a
little
hand
-
bell
;
and
a
long
table
,
set
out
at
intervals
with
sheets
of
blotting
-
paper
,
foolscap
,
clean
pens
,
and
inkstands
.
 
<EOS>
The
chairman
having
taken
his
seat
with
great
solemnity
,
the
secretary
supported
him
on
his
right
hand
,
and
the
porter
stood
bolt
upright
behind
them
,
forming
a
warm
background
of
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
board
:
<EOS>
everything
else
being
a
light
-
hearted
little
fiction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bullamy
!
"
said
Mr
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
replied
the
porter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
the
Medical
Officer
know
,
with
my
compliments
,
that
I
wish
to
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Bullamy
cleared
his
throat
,
and
bustled
out
into
the
office
,
crying
"
The
Chairman
of
the
Board
wishes
to
see
the
Medical
Officer
.
 
<EOS>
By
your
leave
there
!
 
<EOS>
By
your
leave

"
 
<EOS>
He
soon
returned
with
the
gentleman
in
question
;
and
at
both
openings
of
the
board
-
room
door
---
 
at
his
coming
in
and
at
his
going
out
---
simple
clients
were
seen
to
stretch
their
necks
and
stand
upon
their
toes
,
thirsting
to
catch
the
slightest
glimpse
of
that
mysterious
chamber
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jobling
,
my
dear
friend
!
"
said
Mr
Tigg
,
"
how
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Bullamy

wait
outside

<EOS>
Crimple

do
n't

<EOS>
And
how

Mr
Montague

eh

"
said
the
Medical
Officer
,
throwing
himself
luxuriously
into
an
easy
-
chair
(
they
were
all
easy
-
chairs
in
the
board
-
room
)
,
and
taking
a
handsome
gold
snuff
-
box
from
the
pocket
of
his
black
satin
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
A
little
worn
with
business
,
eh

<EOS>
If
so

rest

<EOS>
A
little
feverish
from
wine
,
humph

<EOS>
If
so
,
water
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
at
all
the
matter
,
and
quite
comfortable
?
 
<EOS>
Then
take
some
lunch
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
wholesome
thing
at
this
time
of
day
to
strengthen
the
gastric
juices
with
lunch
,
Mr
Montague
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
Medical
Officer
<EOS>
(
he
was
the
same
medical
officer
who
had
followed
poor
old
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
to
the
grave
,
and
who
had
attended
Mrs
Gamp
's
patient
at
the
Bull
)
smiled
in
saying
these
words
;
and
casually
added
,
as
he
brushed
some
grains
of
snuff
from
his
shirt
-
frill
,
"
I
always
take
it
myself
about
this
time
of
day

do
you
know

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bullamy

said
the
Chairman
,
ringing
the
little
bell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir

<EOS>
"
Lunch

<EOS>
"
Not
on
my
account

I
hope

said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good

<EOS>
Thank
you

<EOS>
I
'm
quite
ashamed

<EOS>
Ha

ha
!
<EOS>
if
I
had
been
a
sharp
practitioner
,
Mr
Montague
,
I
should
n't
have
mentioned
it
without
a
fee
;
for
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
if
you
do
n't
make
a
point
of
taking
lunch
,
you
'll
very
soon
come
under
my
hands

<EOS>
Allow
me
to
illustrate
this
.
 
<EOS>
In
Mr
Crimple
's
leg
---
"
   
The
resident
Director
gave
an
involuntary
start
,
for
the
doctor
,
in
the
heat
of
his
demonstration
,
caught
it
up
and
laid
it
across
his
own
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
take
it
off
,
then
and
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
Mr
Crimple
's
leg

you
'll
observe
,
"
pursued
the
doctor
,
turning
back
his
cuffs
and
spanning
the
limb
with
both
hands
,
"
where
Mr
Crimple
's
knee
fits
into
the
socket
,
here
<EOS>
,
there
is
---
that
is
to
say
,
between
the
bone
and
the
socket
---
a
certain
quantity
of
animal
oil
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
pick
MY
leg
out
for
?
"
said
Mr
Crimple
,
looking
with
something
of
an
anxious
expression
at
his
limb
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
same
with
other
legs
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
you
mind
,
my
good
sir

"
returned
the
doctor
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
whether
it
is
the
same
with
other
legs
,
or
not
the
same

<EOS>

But
I
do
mind

"
said
David
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
a
particular
case
,
Mr
Montague
,
"
returned
the
doctor
,
"
as
illustrating
my
remark
,
you
observe
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
portion
of
Mr
Crimple
's
leg
,
sir
,
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
animal
oil
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
one
of
Mr
Crimple
's
joints
,
sir
,
there
is
more
or
less
of
the
same
deposit
.
 
<EOS>
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Crimple
neglects
his
meals
,
or
fails
to
take
his
proper
quantity
of
rest
,
that
oil
wanes
,
and
becomes
exhausted
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
consequence
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crimple
's
bones
sink
down
into
their
sockets
,
sir
,
and
Mr
Crimple
becomes
a
weazen
,
puny
,
stunted
,
miserable
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
let
Mr
Crimple
's
leg
fall
suddenly
,
as
if
he
were
already
in
that
agreeable
condition
;
turned
down
his
wristbands
again
,
and
looked
triumphantly
at
the
chairman
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
know
a
few
secrets
of
nature
in
our
profession
,
sir
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
do
.
 
<EOS>
We
study
for
that
;
we
pass
the
Hall
and
the
College
for
that
;
and
we
take
our
station
in
society
BY
that
.
<EOS>
It
's
extraordinary
how
little
is
known
on
these
subjects
generally
.
<EOS>
Where
do
you
suppose
,
now
"
---
the
doctor
closed
one
eye
,
as
he
leaned
back
smilingly
in
his
chair
,
and
formed
a
triangle
with
his
hands
,
of
which
his
two
thumbs
composed
the
base
---
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
suppose
Mr
Crimple
's
stomach
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crimple
,
more
agitated
than
before
,
clapped
his
hand
immediately
below
his
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
cried
the
doctor
;
"
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
a
popular
mistake
!
 
<EOS>
My
good
sir
,
you
're
altogether
deceived
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
there
,
when
it
's
out
of
order
;
that
's
all
I
know
,
"
said
Crimple
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
you
do
,
"
replied
the
doctor
;
"
but
science
knows
better
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
patient
of
mine
once
,
"
touching
one
of
the
many
mourning
rings
upon
his
fingers
,
and
slightly
bowing
his
head
,
"
a
gentleman
who
did
me
the
honour
to
make
a
very
handsome
mention
of
me
in
his
will
---
"
in
testimony
,
"
as
he
was
pleased
to
say
,
"
of
the
unremitting
zeal
,
talent
,
and
attention
of
my
friend
and
medical
attendant
,
John
Jobling
,
Esquire
,
M*R*C*S
,
"
---
who
was
so
overcome
by
the
idea
of
having
all
his
life
laboured
under
an
erroneous
view
of
the
locality
of
this
important
organ
,
that
when
I
assured
him
on
my
professional
reputation
,
he
was
mistaken
,
he
burst
into
tears
,
put
out
his
hand
,
and
said
,
"
Jobling
,
God
bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
he
became
speechless
,
and
was
ultimately
buried
at
Brixton
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
your
leave
there

cried
Bullamy
,
without

Refreshment

Board
-
room

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
doctor
,
jocularly
,
as
he
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
the
table
.

"
The
true
Life
Assurance
,
Mr
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
Policy
in
the
world
,
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
be
provident
,
and
eat
and
drink
whenever
we
can
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
Mr
Crimple
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
resident
Director
acquiesced
rather
sulkily
,
as
if
the
gratification
of
replenishing
his
stomach
had
been
impaired
by
the
unsettlement
of
his
preconceived
opinions
in
reference
to
its
situation
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
appearance
of
the
porter
and
under
-
porter
with
a
tray
covered
with
a
snow
-
white
cloth
,
which
,
being
thrown
back
,
displayed
a
pair
of
cold
roast
fowls
,
flanked
by
some
potted
meats
and
a
cool
salad
,
quickly
restored
his
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
enhanced
still
further
by
the
arrival
of
a
bottle
of
excellent
madeira
,
and
another
of
champagne
;
and
he
soon
attacked
the
repast
with
an
appetite
scarcely
inferior
to
that
of
the
medical
officer
.
   
<EOS>
The
lunch
was
handsomely
served
,
with
a
profusion
of
rich
glass
plate
,
and
china
;
which
seemed
to
denote
that
eating
and
drinking
on
a
showy
scale
formed
no
unimportant
item
in
the
business
of
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Directorship
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
proceeded
,
the
Medical
Officer
grew
more
and
more
joyous
and
red
-
faced
,
insomuch
that
every
mouthful
he
ate
,
and
every
drop
of
wine
he
swallowed
,
seemed
to
impart
new
lustre
to
his
eyes
,
and
to
light
up
new
sparks
in
his
nose
and
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
In
certain
quarters
of
the
City
and
its
neighbourhood
,
Mr
Jobling
was
,
as
we
have
already
seen
in
some
measure
,
a
very
popular
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
portentously
sagacious
chin
,
and
a
pompous
voice
,
with
a
rich
huskiness
in
some
of
its
tones
that
went
directly
to
the
heart
,
like
a
ray
of
light
shining
through
the
ruddy
medium
of
choice
old
burgundy
.
 
<EOS>
His
neckerchief
and
shirt
-
frill
were
ever
of
the
whitest
,
his
clothes
of
the
blackest
and
sleekest
,
his
gold
watch
-
chain
of
the
heaviest
,
and
his
seals
of
the
largest
.
 
<EOS>
His
boots
,
which
were
always
of
the
brightest
,
creaked
as
he
walked
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
could
shake
his
head
,
rub
his
hands
,
or
warm
himself
before
a
fire
,
better
than
any
man
alive
;
and
he
had
a
peculiar
way
of
smacking
his
lips
and
saying
,
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
at
intervals
while
patients
detailed
their
symptoms
,
which
inspired
great
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
express
,
"
I
know
what
you
're
going
to
say
better
than
you
do
;
but
go
on
,
go
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
talked
on
all
occasions
whether
he
had
anything
to
say
or
not
,
it
was
unanimously
observed
of
him
that
he
was
"
full
of
anecdote
;
"
and
his
experience
and
profit
from
it
were
considered
,
for
the
same
reason
,
to
be
something
much
too
extensive
for
description
.
 
<EOS>
His
female
patients
could
never
praise
him
too
highly
;
and
the
coldest
of
his
male
admirers
would
always
say
this
for
him
to
their
friends
,
"
that
whatever
Jobling
's
professional
skill
might
be
(
and
it
could
not
be
denied
that
he
had
a
very
high
reputation
)
,
he
was
one
of
the
most
comfortable
fellows
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jobling
was
for
many
reasons
,
and
not
last
in
the
list
because
his
connection
lay
principally
among
tradesmen
and
their
families
,
exactly
the
sort
of
person
whom
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Company
wanted
for
a
medical
officer
.
 
<EOS>
But
Jobling
was
far
too
knowing
to
connect
himself
with
the
company
in
any
closer
ties
than
as
a
paid
(
and
well
paid
)
functionary
,
or
to
allow
his
connection
to
be
misunderstood
abroad
,
if
he
could
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
he
always
stated
the
case
to
an
inquiring
patient
,
after
this
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
sir
,
with
regard
to
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
,
my
information
,
you
see
,
is
limited
;
very
limited
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
medical
officer
,
in
consideration
of
a
certain
monthly
payment
.
 
<EOS>
The
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
;

patient
,

)
---
"
and
I
receive
it
regularly

<EOS>
Therefore
I
am
bound
,
so
far
as
my
own
knowledge
goes
,
to
speak
well
of
the
establishment

<EOS>
(
"
Nothing
can
be
fairer
than
Jobling
's
conduct

"
thinks
the
patient
,
who
has
just
paid
Jobling
's
bill
himself

<EOS>
"
If
you
put
any
question
to
me

"
says
the
doctor
,
"
touching
the
responsibility

capital

the
company

I
am
at
fault

I
have
no
head

figures

not
being
a
shareholder

am
delicate
of
showing
any
curiosity

subject

Delicacy

should
be

<EOS>
(
"
Nothing
can
be
finer
or
more
gentlemanly
than
Jobling
's

the
patient

are

should

doing
anything

I
'll
pass
you
,
you
may
depend

I
can
conscientiously
report

healthy
subject

I
understand
any
man

constitution

it
is
yours

little
indisposition
has
done
him
more
good

says
the
doctor
,
turning
to
the
patient
's
wife
,
"
than
if
he
had
swallowed

contents

caution

He
tried
to
look
as
if
there
were
no
doubt
about
it
;
but
feeling
that
he
did
it
but
indifferently
,
changed
the
theme

praised
the
wine

"
Talking

reminds
me
of

"
No

"
Oh

Tigg

smoothing
his

cast

connection
with
the
company
,
farther
than
giving
them
,
for
a
certain
fee
and
reward
,
my
poor
opinion
as
a
medical
man
,
precisely
as
I
may
give
it
any
day
to
Jack
Noakes
or
Tom
Styles
.
 
<EOS>
Then
why
do
I
say
our
chairman
?
 
<EOS>
Simply
because
I
hear
the
phrase
constantly
repeated
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
Such
is
the
involuntary
operation
of
the
mental
faculty
in
the
imitative
biped
man
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crimple
,
I
believe
you
never
take
snuff
?
 
<EOS>
Injudicious
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
.
"
   
<EOS>
Pending
these
remarks
on
the
part
of
the
doctor
,
and
the
lengthened
and
sonorous
pinch
with
which
he
followed
them
up
,
Jonas
took
a
seat
at
the
board
;
as
ungainly
a
man
as
ever
he
has
been
within
the
reader
's
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
too
common
with
all
of
us
,
but
it
is
especially
in
the
nature
of
a
mean
mind
,
to
be
overawed
by
fine
clothes
and
fine
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
very
decided
influence
on
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
two
gentlemen
have
business
to
discuss
,
I
know
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
and
your
time
is
precious
.
 
<EOS>
So
is
mine
;
for
several
lives
are
waiting
for
me
in
the
next
room
,
and
I
have
a
round
of
visits
to
make
after
---
after
I
have
taken
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Having
had
the
happiness
to
introduce
you
to
each
other
,
I
may
go
about
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
But
allow
me
,
Mr
Montague
,
before
I
go
,
to
say
this
of
my
friend
who
sits
beside
you
:
That
gentleman
has
done
more
,
sir
,
"
rapping
his
snuff
-
box
solemnly
,
"
to
reconcile
me
to
human
nature
,
than
any
man
alive
or
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
Jobling
bolted
abruptly
out
of
the
room
,
and
proceeded
in
his
own
official
department
,
to
impress
the
lives
in
waiting
with
a
sense
of
his
keen
conscientiousness
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
,
and
the
great
difficulty
of
getting
into
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
;
by
feeling
their
pulses
,
looking
at
their
tongues
,
listening
at
their
ribs
,
poking
them
in
the
chest
,
and
so
forth
;
though
,
if
he
did
n't
well
know
beforehand
that
whatever
kind
of
lives
they
were
,
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
would
accept
them
readily
,
he
was
far
from
being
the
Jobling
that
his
friend
considered
him
;
and
was
not
the
original
Jobling
,
but
a
spurious
imitation
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crimple
also
departed
on
the
business
of
the
morning
;
and
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
and
Tigg
were
left
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
learn
from
our
friend
,
"
said
Tigg
,
drawing
his
chair
towards
Jonas
with
a
winning
ease
of
manner
,
"
that
you
have
been
thinking
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Ecod
<EOS>
then
he
'd
no
right
to
say
so
,
"
cried
Jonas
,
interrupting
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
tell
HIM
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
took
it
into
his
head
that
I
was
coming
here
for
such
or
such
a
purpose
,
why
,
that
's
his
lookout
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
stand
committed
by
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
said
this
offensively
enough
;
for
over
and
above
the
habitual
distrust
of
his
character
,
it
was
in
his
nature
to
seek
to
revenge
himself
on
the
fine
clothes
and
the
fine
furniture
,
in
exact
proportion
as
he
had
been
unable
to
withstand
their
influence
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
come
here
to
ask
a
question
or
two
,
and
get
a
document
or
two
to
consider
of
,
I
do
n't
bind
myself
to
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Let
's
understand
that
,
you
know
,
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tigg
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
,
"
I
applaud
your
frankness
.
 
<EOS>
If
men
like
you
and
I
speak
openly
at
first
,
all
possible
misunderstanding
is
avoided
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
disguise
what
you
know
so
well
,
but
what
the
crowd
never
dream
of
?
<EOS>
We
companies
are
all
birds
of
prey
;
mere
birds
of
prey
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
question
is
,
whether
in
serving
our
own
turn
,
we
can
serve
yours
too
;
whether
in
double
-
lining
our
own
nest
,
we
can
put
a
single
living
into
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
're
in
our
secret
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
behind
the
scenes
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
make
a
merit
of
dealing
plainly
with
you
,
when
we
know
we
ca
n't
help
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
remarked
,
on
the
first
introduction
of
Mr
Jonas
into
these
pages
<EOS>
,
that
there
is
a
simplicity
of
cunning
no
less
than
a
simplicity
of
innocence
,
and
that
in
all
matters
involving
a
faith
in
knavery
,
he
was
the
most
credulous
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Tigg
had
preferred
any
claim
to
high
and
honourable
dealing
,
Jonas
would
have
suspected
him
though
he
had
been
a
very
model
of
probity
;
but
when
he
gave
utterance
to
Jonas
's
own
thoughts
of
everything
and
everybody
,
Jonas
began
to
feel
that
he
was
a
pleasant
fellow
,
and
one
to
be
talked
to
freely
.
   
<EOS>
He
changed
his
position
in
the
chair
,
not
for
a
less
awkward
,
but
for
a
more
boastful
attitude
;
and
smiling
in
his
miserable
conceit
rejoined
:
   
"
<EOS>
You
an't
a
bad
man
of
business
,
Mr
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
how
to
set
about
it
,
I
WILL
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Tut
,
tut
,
"
said
Tigg
,
nodding
confidentially
,
and
showing
his
white
teeth
;
"
we
are
not
children
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
;
we
are
grown
men
,
I
hope
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
assented
,
and
said
after
a
short
silence
,
first
spreading
out
his
legs
,
and
sticking
one
arm
akimbo
to
show
how
perfectly
at
home
he
was
,
   
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
---
"
   
"
Do
n't
say
,
the
truth
,
"
interposed
Tigg
,
with
another
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
like
humbug
.
"
   
<EOS>
Greatly
charmed
by
this
,
Jonas
began
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
---
"
   
"
Better
,
"
muttered
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
better
!
"
   
"
---
That
I
did
n't
consider
myself
very
well
used
by
one
or
two
of
the
old
companies
in
some
negotiations
I
have
had
with
'em
---
once
had
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
They
started
objections
they
had
no
right
to
start
,
and
put
questions
they
had
no
right
to
put
,
and
carried
things
much
too
high
for
my
taste
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
made
these
observations
he
cast
down
his
eyes
,
and
looked
curiously
at
the
carpet
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tigg
looked
curiously
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
made
so
long
a
pause
,
that
Tigg
came
to
the
rescue
,
and
said
,
in
his
pleasantest
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
Take
a
glass
of
wine
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
returned
Jonas
,
with
a
cunning
shake
of
the
head
;
"
none
of
that
,
thankee
.
 
<EOS>
No
wine
over
business
.
 
<EOS>
All
very
well
for
you
,
<EOS>
but
it
would
n't
do
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
old
hand
you
are
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
!
"
said
Tigg
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
and
leering
at
him
through
his
half
-
shut
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
shook
his
head
again
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
You
're
right
there
;
"
And
then
resumed
,
jocosely
:
   
"
Not
such
an
old
hand
,
either
,
but
that
I
've
been
and
got
married
.
<EOS>
That
's
rather
green
,
you
'll
say
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
,
especially
as
she
's
young
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
never
knows
what
may
happen
to
these
women
,
so
I
'm
thinking
of
insuring
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
but
fair
,
you
know
,
that
a
man
should
secure
some
consolation
in
case
of
meeting
with
such
a
loss
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
anything
can
console
him
under
such
heart
-
breaking
circumstances
,
"
murmured
Tigg
,
with
his
eyes
shut
up
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
returned
Jonas
;
"
if
anything
can
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
supposing
I
did
it
here
,
I
should
do
it
cheap
,
I
know
,
and
easy
,
without
bothering
her
about
it
;
which
I
'd
much
rather
not
do
,
<EOS>
for
it
's
just
in
a
woman
's
way
to
take
it
into
her
head
,
if
you
talk
to
her
about
such
things
,
that
she
's
going
to
die
directly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
"
cried
Tigg
,
kissing
his
hand
in
honour
of
the
sex
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
Sweet
,
silly
<EOS>
,
fluttering
little
simpletons
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Jonas
,
"
on
that
account
,
you
know
,
and
because
offence
has
been
given
me
in
other
quarters
<EOS>
,
I
would
n't
mind
patronizing
this
Company
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
want
to
know
what
sort
of
security
there
is
for
the
Company
's
going
on
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
---
"
   
"
Not
the
truth
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Tigg
,
holding
up
his
jewelled
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
use
that
Sunday
School
expression
,
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
long
and
the
short
of
it
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
,
what
's
the
security
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
paid
-
up
capital
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
Tigg
,
referring
to
some
papers
on
the
table
,
"
is
,
at
this
present
moment
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
understand
all
about
paid
-
up
capitals
,
you
know
,
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Tigg
,
stopping
short
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
turned
the
papers
down
again
,
and
moving
nearer
to
him
,
said
in
his
ear
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
much
in
Jonas
's
way
to
look
straight
at
anybody
;
but
thus
requested
,
he
made
shift
to
take
a
tolerable
survey
of
the
chairman
's
features
.
 
<EOS>
The
chairman
fell
back
a
little
,
to
give
him
the
better
opportunity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
elevating
his
eyebrows
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
?
<EOS>
You
've
seen
me
before
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
thought
I
remembered
your
face
when
I
first
came
in
,
"
said
Jonas
,
gazing
at
it
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
could
n't
call
to
mind
where
I
had
seen
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
,
even
now
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
in
the
street
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
it
in
Pecksniff
's
parlour
?
"
said
Tigg
   
<EOS>
"
In
Pecksniff
's
parlour
!
"
echoed
Jonas
,
fetching
a
long
breath
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
when
---
"
   
"
Yes
,
"
cried
Tigg
,
"
when
there
was
a
very
charming
and
delightful
little
family
party
,
at
which
yourself
and
your
respected
father
assisted
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
never
mind
HIM
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
dead
,
and
there
's
no
help
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
,
is
he
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tigg
,
"
<EOS>
Venerable
old
gentleman
,
is
he
dead
!
<EOS>
You
're
very
like
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
received
this
compliment
with
anything
but
a
good
grace
,
perhaps
because
of
his
own
private
sentiments
in
reference
to
the
personal
appearance
of
his
deceased
parent
;
perhaps
because
he
was
not
best
pleased
to
find
that
Montague
and
Tigg
were
one
.
 
<EOS>
That
gentleman
perceived
it
,
and
tapping
him
familiarly
on
the
sleeve
,
beckoned
him
to
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
moment
,
Mr
Montague
's
jocularity
and
flow
of
spirits
were
remarkable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
find
me
at
all
changed
since
that
time
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
plainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
looked
hard
at
his
waistcoat
and
jewels
;
and
said
"
Rather
,
ecod
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
I
at
all
seedy
in
those
days
?
"
asked
Montague
.
   
<EOS>
"
Precious
seedy
,
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
pointed
down
into
the
street
,
where
Bailey
and
the
cab
were
in
attendance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Neat
;
perhaps
dashing
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
whose
it
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mine
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
like
this
room
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
cost
a
lot
of
money
,
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
too
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
"
---
he
whispered
this
,
and
nudged
him
in
the
side
with
his
elbow
---
<EOS>
"
why
do
n't
you
take
premiums
,
instead
of
paying
'em
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
a
man
like
you
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
Join
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
stared
at
him
in
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
a
crowded
street
?
"
asked
Montague
,
calling
his
attention
to
the
multitude
without
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
Jonas
,
only
glancing
at
it
,
and
immediately
afterwards
looking
at
him
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
printed
calculations
,
"
said
his
companion
,
"
which
will
tell
you
pretty
nearly
how
many
people
will
pass
up
and
down
that
thoroughfare
in
the
course
of
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
how
many
of
'em
will
come
in
here
,
merely
because
they
find
this
office
here
;
knowing
no
more
about
it
than
they
do
of
the
Pyramids
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
Join
us
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
come
in
cheap
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
looked
at
him
harder
and
harder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
Tigg
in
his
ear
,
"
how
many
of
'em
will
buy
annuities
,
effect
insurances
,
bring
us
their
money
in
a
hundred
shapes
and
ways
,
force
it
upon
us
,
trust
us
as
if
we
were
the
Mint
;
yet
know
no
more
about
us
than
you
do
of
that
crossing
-
sweeper
at
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
   
Jonas
gradually
broke
into
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Montague
,
giving
him
a
pleasant
thrust
in
the
breast
;
"
you
're
too
deep
for
us
,
you
dog
,
or
I
would
n't
have
told
you
.
 
<EOS>
Dine
with
me
to
-
morrow
,
in
Pall
Mall
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Done
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
Take
these
papers
with
you
and
look
'em
over
.
 
<EOS>
See
,
"
he
said
,
snatching
some
printed
forms
from
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
B
is
a
little
tradesman
,
clerk
,
parson
,
artist
,
author
,
any
common
thing
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Jonas
,
looking
greedily
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
B
wants
a
loan
.
 
<EOS>
Say
fifty
or
a
hundred
pound
;
perhaps
more
;
no
matter
.
 
<EOS>
B
proposes
self
and
two
securities
.
 
<EOS>
B
is
accepted
.
 
<EOS>
Two
securities
give
a
bond
.
 
<EOS>
B
assures
his
own
life
for
double
the
amount
,
and
brings
two
friends
'
lives
also
---
just
to
patronize
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Is
that
a
good
notion
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
,
that
's
a
capital
notion
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
does
he
really
do
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
it
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
chairman
.
 
<EOS>
"
B
's
hard
up
,
my
good
fellow
,
and
will
do
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
my
idea
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
you
honour
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
blest
if
it
do
n't
,
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
does
,
"
replied
the
chairman
,
"
and
I
'm
proud
to
hear
you
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
B
pays
the
highest
lawful
interest
---
"
   
"
That
an't
much
,
"
interrupted
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Right
!
<EOS>
quite
right
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
hard
it
is
upon
the
part
of
the
law
that
it
should
be
so
confoundedly
down
upon
us
unfortunate
victims
;
when
it
takes
such
amazing
good
interest
for
itself
from
all
its
clients
.
 
<EOS>
But
charity
begins
at
home
,
and
justice
begins
next
door
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
The
law
being
hard
upon
us
,
we
're
not
exactly
soft
upon
B
;
for
besides
charging
B
the
regular
interest
,
we
get
B
's
premium
,
and
B
's
friends
'
premiums
,
and
we
charge
B
for
the
bond
,
and
,
whether
we
accept
him
or
not
,
we
charge
B
for
"
inquiries
"
(
we
keep
a
man
,
at
a
pound
a
week
,
to
make
'
em
)
,
and
we
charge
B
a
trifle
for
the
secretary
;
and
in
short
,
my
good
fellow
,
we
stick
it
into
B
,
up
hill
and
down
dale
,
and
make
a
devilish
comfortable
little
property
out
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
drive
B
,
in
point
of
fact
,
"
said
Tigg
,
pointing
to
the
cabriolet
,
"
and
a
thoroughbred
horse
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
enjoyed
this
joke
very
much
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
in
his
peculiar
vein
of
humour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Tigg
Montague
,
"
we
grant
annuities
on
the
very
lowest
and
<EOS>
most
advantageous
terms
known
in
the
money
market
;
and
the
old
ladies
and
gentlemen
down
in
the
country
buy
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
And
we
pay
'em
too
---
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
   
"
But
there
's
responsibility
in
that
,
"
said
Jonas
,
looking
doubtful
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
it
all
myself
,
"
said
Tigg
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
responsible
for
everything
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
responsible
person
in
the
establishment
!
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Then
there
are
the
Life
Assurances
without
loans
;
the
common
policies
.
 
<EOS>
Very
profitable
,
very
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Money
down
,
you
know
;
repeated
every
year
;
capital
fun
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
when
they
begin
to
fall
in
,
"
observed
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
,
while
the
office
is
young
,
but
when
the
policies
begin
to
die
---
that
's
what
I
am
thinking
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
the
first
start
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Montague
,
"
to
show
you
how
correct
your
judgment
is
,
we
had
a
couple
of
unlucky
deaths
that
brought
us
down
to
a
grand
piano
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Brought
you
down
where
?
"
cried
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
sacred
word
of
honour
,
"
said
Tigg
Montague
,
"
that
I
raised
money
on
every
other
individual
piece
of
property
,
and
was
left
alone
in
the
world
with
a
grand
piano
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
an
upright
-
grand
too
,
so
that
I
could
n't
even
sit
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
fellow
,
we
got
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
granted
a
great
many
new
policies
that
week
(
liberal
allowance
to
solicitors
,
by
the
bye
)
,
and
got
over
it
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
they
should
chance
to
fall
in
heavily
,
as
you
very
justly
observe
they
may
,
one
of
these
days
;
then
---
"
he
finished
the
sentence
in
so
low
a
whisper
,
that
only
one
disconnected
word
was
audible
,
and
that
imperfectly
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
sounded
like
"
Bolt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
're
as
bold
as
brass
!
"
<EOS>
said
Jonas
,
in
the
utmost
admiration
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
man
can
well
afford
to
be
as
bold
as
brass
,
my
good
fellow
,
when
he
gets
gold
in
exchange
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
chairman
,
with
a
laugh
that
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
dine
with
me
to
-
morrow
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
what
time
?
"
asked
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Seven
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
my
card
.
 
<EOS>
Take
the
documents
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
'll
join
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
good
deal
to
be
looked
into
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
look
,
"
said
Montague
,
slapping
him
on
the
back
,
"
into
anything
and
everything
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
join
us
<EOS>
,
I
am
convinced
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
made
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Bullamy
!
"
   
<EOS>
Obedient
to
the
summons
and
the
little
bell
<EOS>
,
the
waistcoat
appeared
.
<EOS>
Being
charged
to
show
Jonas
out
,
it
went
before
;
and
the
voice
within
it
cried
,
as
usual
,
"
By
your
leave
there
,
by
your
leave
!
<EOS>
Gentleman
from
the
board
-
room
,
by
your
leave
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
being
left
alone
,
pondered
for
some
moments
,
and
then
said
,
raising
his
voice
:
   
"
<EOS>
Is
Nadgett
in
the
office
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
promptly
entered
;
shutting
the
board
-
room
door
after
him
,
as
carefully
as
if
he
were
about
to
plot
a
murder
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
the
man
at
a
pound
a
week
who
made
the
inquiries
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
virtue
or
merit
in
Nadgett
that
he
transacted
all
his
Anglo
-
Bengalee
business
secretly
and
in
the
closest
confidence
;
for
he
was
born
to
be
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
short
,
dried
-
up
,
withered
old
man
,
who
seemed
to
have
secreted
his
very
blood
;
for
nobody
would
have
given
him
credit
for
the
possession
of
six
ounces
of
it
in
his
whole
body
.
<EOS>
How
he
lived
was
a
secret
;
where
he
lived
was
a
secret
;
and
even
what
he
was
,
was
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
musty
old
pocket
-
book
he
carried
contradictory
cards
,
in
some
of
which
he
called
himself
a
coal
-
merchant
,
in
others
<EOS>
a
wine
-
merchant
,
in
others
a
commission
-
agent
,
in
others
<EOS>
a
collector
,
in
others
an
accountant
;
as
if
he
really
did
n't
know
the
secret
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
keeping
appointments
in
the
City
,
and
the
other
man
never
seemed
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
sit
on
"
Change
for
hours
,
looking
at
everybody
who
walked
in
and
out
,
and
would
do
the
like
at
Garraway
's
,
and
in
other
business
coffee
-
rooms
,
in
some
of
which
he
would
be
occasionally
seen
drying
a
very
damp
pocket
-
handkerchief
before
the
fire
,
and
still
looking
over
his
shoulder
for
the
man
who
never
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
mildewed
,
threadbare
,
shabby
;
always
had
flue
upon
his
legs
and
back
;
and
kept
his
linen
so
secretly
buttoning
up
and
wrapping
over
,
that
he
might
have
had
none
---
perhaps
he
had
n't
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
one
stained
beaver
glove
,
which
he
dangled
before
him
by
the
forefinger
as
he
walked
or
sat
;
but
even
its
fellow
was
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
said
he
had
been
a
bankrupt
,
others
that
he
had
gone
an
infant
into
an
ancient
Chancery
suit
which
was
still
depending
,
but
it
was
all
a
secret
.
<EOS>
He
carried
bits
of
sealing
-
wax
and
a
hieroglyphical
old
copper
seal
in
his
pocket
,
and
often
secretly
indited
letters
in
corner
boxes
of
the
trysting
-
places
before
mentioned
;
but
they
never
appeared
to
go
to
anybody
,
for
he
would
put
them
into
a
secret
place
in
his
coat
,
and
deliver
them
to
himself
weeks
afterwards
,
very
much
to
his
own
surprise
,
quite
yellow
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
that
sort
of
man
that
if
he
had
died
worth
a
million
of
money
,
or
had
died
worth
<EOS>
twopence
halfpenny
<EOS>
,
everybody
would
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
,
and
would
have
said
it
was
just
as
they
expected
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
belonged
to
a
class
;
a
race
peculiar
to
the
City
;
who
are
secrets
as
profound
to
one
another
,
as
they
are
to
the
rest
of
mankind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Nadgett
,
"
said
Montague
,
copying
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
's
address
upon
a
piece
of
paper
,
from
the
card
which
was
still
lying
on
the
table
,
"
any
information
about
this
name
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
myself
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
mind
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Any
you
can
scrape
together
,
bring
me
.
<EOS>
Bring
it
to
me
,
Mr
Nadgett
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nadgett
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
read
the
name
attentively
;
then
looked
at
the
chairman
over
his
glasses
,
and
bowed
;
then
took
them
off
,
and
put
them
in
their
case
;
and
then
put
the
case
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
so
,
he
looked
,
without
his
spectacles
,
at
the
paper
as
it
lay
before
him
,
and
at
the
same
time
produced
his
pocket
-
book
from
somewhere
about
the
middle
of
his
spine
.
 
<EOS>
Large
as
it
was
,
it
was
very
full
of
documents
,
but
he
found
a
place
for
this
one
;
and
having
clasped
it
carefully
,
passed
it
by
a
kind
of
solemn
legerdemain
into
the
same
region
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
He
withdrew
with
another
bow
and
without
a
word
;
opening
the
door
no
wider
than
was
sufficient
for
his
passage
out
;
and
shutting
it
as
carefully
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
chairman
of
the
board
employed
the
rest
of
the
morning
in
affixing
his
sign
-
manual
of
gracious
acceptance
to
various
new
proposals
of
annuity
-
purchase
and
assurance
.
 
<EOS>
The
Company
was
looking
up
,
for
they
flowed
in
gaily
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
28
.
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
at
home
 
<EOS>
There
were
many
powerful
reasons
for
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
being
strongly
prepossessed
in
favour
of
the
scheme
which
its
great
originator
had
so
boldly
laid
open
to
him
;
but
three
among
them
stood
prominently
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Firstly
,
there
was
money
to
be
made
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
the
money
had
the
peculiar
charm
of
being
sagaciously
obtained
at
other
people
's
cost
.
 
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
it
involved
much
outward
show
of
homage
and
distinction
:
a
board
being
an
awful
institution
in
its
own
sphere
,
and
a
director
a
mighty
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
make
a
swingeing
profit
,
have
a
lot
of
chaps
to
order
about
,
and
get
into
regular
good
society
by
one
and
the
same
means
,
and
them
so
easy
to
one
's
hand
,
ai
n't
such
a
bad
look
-
out
,
"
thought
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
considerations
were
only
second
to
his
avarice
;
for
,
conscious
that
there
was
nothing
in
his
person
,
conduct
,
character
,
or
accomplishments
,
to
command
respect
,
he
was
greedy
of
power
,
and
was
,
in
his
heart
,
as
much
a
tyrant
as
any
laureled
conqueror
on
record
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
determined
to
proceed
with
cunning
and
caution
,
and
to
be
very
keen
on
his
observation
of
the
gentility
of
Mr
Montague
's
private
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
no
more
occurred
to
this
shallow
knave
that
Montague
wanted
him
to
be
so
,
or
he
would
n't
have
invited
him
while
his
decision
was
yet
in
abeyance
,
than
the
possibility
of
that
genius
being
able
to
overreach
him
in
any
way
,
pierced
through
his
self
-
deceit
by
the
inlet
of
a
needle
's
point
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
said
,
in
the
outset
,
that
Jonas
was
too
sharp
for
him
;
and
Jonas
,
who
would
have
been
sharp
enough
to
believe
him
in
nothing
else
,
though
he
had
solemnly
sworn
it
,
believed
him
in
that
,
instantly
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
with
a
faltering
hand
,
and
yet
with
an
imbecile
attempt
at
a
swagger
,
that
he
knocked
at
his
new
friend
's
door
in
Pall
Mall
when
the
appointed
hour
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
quickly
answered
to
the
summons
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
proud
and
was
kindly
disposed
to
take
notice
of
Jonas
;
but
Jonas
had
forgotten
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Montague
at
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
he
wos
at
home
,
and
waiting
dinner
,
too
,
"
said
Bailey
,
with
the
ease
of
an
old
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
your
hat
up
along
with
you
,
or
leave
it
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
preferred
leaving
it
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
hold
name
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Bailey
,
with
a
grin
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
stared
at
him
in
mute
indignation
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
do
n't
you
remember
hold
mother
Todgers
's
?
"
said
Mr
Bailey
,
with
his
favourite
action
of
the
knees
and
boots
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
remember
my
taking
your
name
up
to
the
young
ladies
,
when
you
came
a
-
courting
there
?
 
<EOS>
A
reg'lar
scaly
old
shop
,
<EOS>
warn't
it
?
 
<EOS>
Times
is
changed
ai
n't
they
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
how
you
've
growed
!
"
   
<EOS>
Without
pausing
for
any
acknowledgement
of
this
compliment
,
he
ushered
the
visitor
upstairs
,
and
having
announced
him
,
retired
with
a
private
wink
.
   
<EOS>
The
lower
story
of
the
house
was
occupied
by
a
wealthy
tradesman
,
but
Mr
Montague
had
all
the
upper
portion
,
and
splendid
lodging
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
he
received
Jonas
was
a
spacious
and
elegant
apartment
,
furnished
with
extreme
magnificence
;
decorated
with
pictures
,
copies
from
the
antique
in
alabaster
and
marble
,
china
vases
,
lofty
mirrors
,
crimson
hangings
of
the
richest
silk
,
gilded
carvings
,
luxurious
couches
,
glistening
cabinets
inlaid
with
precious
woods
;
costly
toys
of
every
sort
in
negligent
abundance
.
<EOS>
The
only
guests
besides
Jonas
were
the
doctor
,
the
resident
Director
,
and
two
other
gentlemen
,
whom
Montague
presented
in
due
form
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Jobling
<EOS>
you
know
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
"
said
the
doctor
pleasantly
,
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
circle
to
shake
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
I
have
the
honour
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
I
see
you
well
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
well
?
 
<EOS>
THAT
'S
well
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Wolf
,
"
said
Montague
,
as
soon
as
the
doctor
would
allow
him
to
introduce
the
two
others
,
"
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pip
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
"
   
<EOS>
Both
gentlemen
were
exceedingly
happy
to
have
the
honour
of
making
Mr
Chuzzlewit
's
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
drew
Jonas
a
little
apart
,
and
whispered
behind
his
hand
:
   
<EOS>
"
Men
of
the
world
,
my
dear
sir
---
men
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wolf
 
<EOS>
---
literary
character
---
you
need
n't
mention
it
---
<EOS>
remarkably
clever
weekly
paper
---
<EOS>
oh
,
remarkably
clever
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pip
---
theatrical
man
---
 
capital
man
to
know
---
<EOS>
oh
,
capital
man
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Wolf
,
folding
his
arms
and
resuming
a
conversation
which
the
arrival
of
Jonas
had
interrupted
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
Lord
Nobley
say
to
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
returned
Pip
,
with
an
oath
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
Same
,
sir
,
if
he
was
n't
as
mute
as
a
poker
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
what
a
good
fellow
Nobley
is
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
best
fellow
in
the
world
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wolf
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
as
only
last
week
that
Nobley
said
to
me
,
"
By
Gad
,
Wolf
,
I
've
got
a
living
to
bestow
,
and
if
you
had
but
been
brought
up
at
the
University
,
strike
me
blind
if
I
would
n't
have
made
a
parson
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
Just
like
him
,
"
said
Pip
with
another
oath
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
'd
have
done
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
doubt
of
it
,
"
said
Wolf
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
were
going
to
tell
us
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
"
cried
Pip
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
he
was
dumb
---
sewn
up
,
dead
,
sir
---
<EOS>
but
after
a
minute
he
said
to
the
Duke
,
"
Here
's
Pip
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
Pip
.
 
<EOS>
Pip
's
our
mutual
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
Pip
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Damme
!
"
said
the
Duke
,
"
I
appeal
to
Pip
then
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Pip
.
<EOS>
Bandy
or
not
bandy
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
out
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bandy
,
your
Grace
,
by
the
Lord
Harry
!
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
the
Duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
she
is
.
<EOS>
Bravo
,
Pip
.
 
<EOS>
Well
said
Pip
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
die
if
you
're
not
a
trump
,
Pip
.
 
<EOS>
Pop
me
down
among
your
fashionable
visitors
whenever
I
'm
in
town
,
Pip
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
do
,
to
this
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
conclusion
of
this
story
gave
immense
satisfaction
,
which
was
in
no
degree
lessened
by
the
announcement
of
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
repaired
to
the
dining
room
,
along
with
his
distinguished
host
,
and
took
his
seat
at
the
board
between
that
individual
and
his
friend
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
The
rest
fell
into
their
places
like
men
who
were
well
accustomed
to
the
house
;
and
dinner
was
done
full
justice
to
,
by
all
parties
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
a
one
as
money
(
or
credit
,
no
matter
which
)
could
produce
.
 
<EOS>
The
dishes
,
wines
,
and
fruits
were
of
the
choicest
kind
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
elegantly
served
.
 
<EOS>
The
plate
was
gorgeous
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
was
in
the
midst
of
a
calculation
of
the
value
of
this
item
alone
,
when
his
host
disturbed
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
glass
of
wine
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Jonas
,
who
had
had
several
glasses
already
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
much
of
that
as
you
like
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
too
good
to
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
!
"
cried
Wolf
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
Gag
,
upon
my
soul
!
"
said
Pip
.
   
<EOS>
"
Positively
,
you
know
,
that
's
---
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
observed
the
doctor
,
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
for
one
instant
,
and
then
going
to
work
again
,
pell
-
mell
---
"
<EOS>
that
's
epigrammatic
;
quite
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
tolerably
comfortable
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Tigg
,
apart
to
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
trouble
your
head
about
ME
,
"
he
replied
,
"
Famous
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
best
not
to
have
a
party
,
"
said
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
feel
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
do
you
call
this
?
"
retorted
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
do
this
every
day
,
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Montague
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
"
every
day
of
my
life
,
when
I
dine
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
my
common
style
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
having
anything
uncommon
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
have
seen
through
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
a
party
?
"
said
Crimple
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wo
n't
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
he
shall
take
us
in
the
rough
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
pretty
smooth
,
too
,
ecod
!
"
said
Jonas
,
glancing
round
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
do
n't
cost
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
be
candid
with
you
,
it
does
not
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
like
this
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
way
I
spend
my
money
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
thrust
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
,
and
said
,
"
Was
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
join
us
,
you
wo
n't
get
rid
of
your
share
of
the
profits
in
the
same
way
?
"
said
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
different
,
"
retorted
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
you
're
right
,
"
said
Tigg
,
with
friendly
candour
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
a
Company
must
do
it
to
hold
the
connection
together
;
but
,
as
I
take
a
pleasure
in
it
,
that
's
my
department
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mind
dining
expensively
at
another
man
's
expense
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
a
bit
,
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
hope
you
'll
often
dine
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Jonas
,
"
I
do
n't
mind
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'll
never
attempt
to
talk
business
to
you
over
wine
<EOS>
,
I
take
my
oath
,
"
said
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
deep
,
deep
,
deep
of
you
this
morning
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
tell
'em
that
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
the
very
men
to
enjoy
it
.
 
<EOS>
Pip
,
my
good
fellow
<EOS>
,
I
've
a
splendid
little
trait
to
tell
you
of
my
friend
Chuzzlewit
who
is
the
deepest
dog
<EOS>
I
know
;
I
give
you
my
sacred
word
of
honour
<EOS>
he
is
the
deepest
dog
I
know
,
Pip
!
"
   
<EOS>
Pip
swore
a
frightful
oath
that
he
was
sure
of
it
already
;
and
the
anecdote
,
being
told
,
was
received
with
loud
applause
,
as
an
incontestable
proof
of
Mr
Jonas
's
greatness
.
 
<EOS>
Pip
,
in
a
natural
spirit
of
emulation
,
then
related
some
instances
of
his
own
depth
;
and
Wolf
not
to
be
left
behind
-
hand
,
recited
the
leading
points
of
one
or
two
vastly
humorous
articles
he
was
then
preparing
.
 
<EOS>
These
lucubrations
being
of
what
he
called
"
a
warm
complexion
,
"
were
highly
approved
;
and
all
the
company
agreed
that
they
were
full
of
point
.
   
<EOS>
"
Men
of
the
world
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
Jobling
whispered
to
Jonas
;
"
thorough
men
of
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
To
a
professional
person
like
myself
<EOS>
it
's
quite
refreshing
to
come
into
this
kind
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
only
agreeable
---
and
nothing
CAN
be
more
agreeable
---
<EOS>
but
it
's
philosophically
improving
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
character
,
my
dear
sir
;
character
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
so
pleasant
to
find
real
merit
appreciated
,
whatever
its
particular
walk
in
life
may
be
,
that
the
general
harmony
of
the
company
was
doubtless
much
promoted
by
their
knowing
that
the
two
men
of
the
world
were
held
in
great
esteem
by
the
upper
classes
of
society
,
and
by
the
gallant
defenders
of
their
country
in
the
army
and
navy
,
but
particularly
the
former
.
 
<EOS>
The
least
of
their
stories
had
a
colonel
in
it
;
lords
were
as
plentiful
as
oaths
;
and
even
the
Blood
Royal
ran
in
the
muddy
channel
of
their
personal
recollections
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Chuzzlewit
did
n't
know
him
,
I
'm
afraid
,
"
said
Wolf
,
in
reference
to
a
certain
personage
of
illustrious
descent
,
who
had
previously
figured
in
a
reminiscence
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
bring
him
into
contact
with
this
sort
of
fellows
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
very
fond
of
literature
,
"
observed
Wolf
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
he
?
"
said
Tigg
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
;
he
took
my
paper
regularly
for
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
<EOS>
he
said
some
good
things
now
and
then
?
 
<EOS>
He
asked
a
certain
Viscount
,
who
's
a
friend
of
mine
<EOS>
---
Pip
knows
him
---
"
What
's
the
editor
's
name
,
what
's
the
editor
's
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wolf
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wolf
,
eh
?
 
Sharp
biter
,
Wolf
.
<EOS>
We
must
keep
the
Wolf
from
the
door
,
as
the
proverb
says
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
And
being
complimentary
,
I
printed
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
Viscount
's
the
boy
!
"

cried
Pip

"
The

He

rather

not

I

Produce

What

Shakspeare

<EOS>
What
's
the
good
of
Shakspeare
,
Pip

<EOS>
I
never
read
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
devil
is
it
all
about

Pip

<EOS>
There
's
a
lot
of
feet
in
Shakspeare

verse
,
but
there
an't
any
legs
worth
mentioning
in
Shakspeare

are
there

Juliet

Desdemona

Lady
Macbeth

and
all
the
rest

'em

their

Why

in

all
Miss

I
'll
tell

it

What

Do
I

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
and
I

added
Pip

"
that
he
DID

handsomely

<EOS>
The
conversation
now
becoming
general
,
Mr
Jonas
's
opinion
was
requested
on
this
subject
;
and
as
it
was
in
full
accordance
with
the
sentiments
of
Mr
Pip
,
that
gentleman
was
extremely
gratified
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
both
himself
and
Wolf
had
so
much
in
common
with
Jonas
,
that
they
became
very
amicable
;
and
between
their
increasing
friendship
and
the
fumes
of
wine
,
Jonas
grew
talkative
.
   
<EOS>
It
does
not
follow
in
the
case
of
such
a
person
that
the
more
talkative
he
becomes
,
the
more
agreeable
he
is
;
on
the
contrary
,
his
merits
show
to
most
advantage
,
perhaps
,
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Having
no
means
,
as
he
thought
,
of
putting
himself
on
an
equality
with
the
rest
,
but
by
the
assertion
of
that
depth
and
sharpness
on
which
he
had
been
complimented
,
Jonas
exhibited
that
faculty
to
the
utmost
;
and
was
so
deep
and
sharp
that
he
lost
himself
in
his
own
profundity
,
and
cut
his
fingers
with
his
own
edge
-
tools
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
especially
in
his
way
and
character
to
exhibit
his
quality
at
his
entertainer
's
expense
;
and
while
he
drank
of
his
sparkling
wines
,
and
partook
of
his
monstrous
profusion
,
to
ridicule
the
extravagance
which
had
set
such
costly
fare
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Even
at
such
a
wanton
board
,
and
in
such
more
than
doubtful
company
,
this
might
have
proved
a
disagreeable
experiment
,
but
that
Tigg
and
Crimple
,
studying
to
understand
their
man
thoroughly
,
gave
him
what
license
he
chose
:
knowing
that
the
more
he
took
,
the
better
for
their
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
while
the
blundering
cheat
---
gull
that
he
was
,
for
all
his
cunning
---
thought
himself
rolled
up
hedgehog
fashion
,
with
his
sharpest
points
towards
them
<EOS>
,
he
was
,
in
fact
,
betraying
all
his
vulnerable
parts
to
their
unwinking
watchfulness
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
the
two
gentlemen
who
contributed
so
much
to
the
doctor
's
philosophical
knowledge
(
by
the
way
,
the
doctor
slipped
off
quietly
,
after
swallowing
his
usual
amount
of
wine
)
had
had
their
cue
distinctly
from
the
host
,
or
took
it
from
what
they
saw
and
heard
,
they
acted
their
parts
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
solicited
the
honour
of
Jonas
's
better
acquaintance
;
trusted
that
they
would
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
him
into
that
elevated
society
in
which
he
was
so
well
qualified
to
shine
;
and
informed
him
,
in
the
most
friendly
manner
that
the
advantages
of
their
respective
establishments
were
entirely
at
his
control
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
they
said
"
Be
one
of
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
Jonas
said
he
was
infinitely
obliged
to
them
,
and
he
would
be
;
adding
within
himself
,
that
so
long
as
they
"
stood
treat
,
"
there
was
nothing
he
would
like
better
.
   
<EOS>
After
coffee
,
which
was
served
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
there
was
a
short
interval
(
mainly
sustained
by
Pip
and
Wolf
)
of
conversation
;
rather
highly
spiced
and
strongly
seasoned
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
flagged
,
Jonas
took
it
up
and
showed
considerable
humour
in
appraising
the
furniture
;
inquiring
whether
such
an
article
was
paid
for
;
what
it
had
originally
cost
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
of
this
,
he
was
,
as
he
considered
,
desperately
hard
on
Montague
,
and
very
demonstrative
of
his
own
brilliant
parts
.
   
<EOS>
Some
Champagne
Punch
gave
a
new
though
temporary
fillip
to
the
entertainments
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
For
after
leading
to
some
noisy
proceedings
,
which
were
not
intelligible
,
it
ended
in
the
unsteady
departure
of
the
two
gentlemen
of
the
world
,
and
the
slumber
of
Mr
Jonas
upon
one
of
the
sofas
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
could
not
be
made
to
understand
where
he
was
,
Mr
Bailey
received
orders
to
call
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
take
him
home
;
which
that
young
gentleman
roused
himself
from
an
uneasy
sleep
in
the
hall
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
now
almost
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
hooked
,
do
you
think
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Crimple
,
as
himself
and
partner
stood
in
a
distant
part
of
the
room
observing
him
as
he
lay
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tigg
,
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
a
strong
iron
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Has
Nadgett
been
here
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
out
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
<EOS>
you
had
company
,
he
went
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
did
he
do
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
said
he
would
come
back
early
in
the
morning
,
before
you
were
out
of
bed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
them
to
be
sure
and
send
him
up
to
my
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Now
Mr
Bailey
,
take
this
gentleman
home
,
and
see
him
safely
in
.
 
<EOS>
Hallo
,
here
!
 
<EOS>
Why
Chuzzlewit
,
halloa
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
got
him
upright
with
some
difficulty
,
and
assisted
him
downstairs
,
where
they
put
his
hat
upon
his
head
,
and
tumbled
him
into
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
,
having
shut
him
in
,
mounted
the
box
beside
the
coachman
,
and
smoked
his
cigar
with
an
air
of
particular
satisfaction
;
the
undertaking
in
which
he
was
engaged
having
a
free
and
sporting
character
about
it
,
which
was
quite
congenial
to
his
taste
.
   
<EOS>
Arriving
in
due
time
at
the
house
in
the
City
,
Mr
Bailey
jumped
down
,
and
expressed
the
lively
nature
of
his
feelings
in
a
knock
the
like
of
which
had
probably
not
been
heard
in
that
quarter
since
the
great
fire
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
Going
out
into
the
road
to
observe
the
effect
of
this
feat
,
he
saw
that
a
dim
light
,
previously
visible
at
an
upper
window
,
had
been
already
removed
and
was
travelling
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
To
obtain
a
foreknowledge
of
the
bearer
of
this
taper
,
Mr
Bailey
skipped
back
to
the
door
again
,
and
put
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
merry
one
herself
.
 
<EOS>
But
sadly
,
strangely
altered
!
 
<EOS>
So
careworn
and
dejected
,
<EOS>
so
faltering
and
full
of
fear
;
so
fallen
,
humbled
,
broken
;
that
to
have
seen
her
quiet
in
her
coffin
would
have
been
a
less
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
She
set
the
light
upon
a
bracket
in
the
hall
,
and
laid
her
hand
upon
her
heart
;
upon
her
eyes
;
upon
her
burning
head
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
came
on
towards
the
door
with
such
a
wild
and
hurried
step
that
Mr
Bailey
lost
his
self
-
possession
,
and
still
had
his
eye
where
the
keyhole
had
been
,
when
she
opened
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
said
Mr
Bailey
,
with
an
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
<EOS>
well
,
though
?
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
her
astonishment
as
she
recognized
him
in
his
altered
dress
,
so
much
of
her
old
smile
came
back
to
her
face
that
Bailey
was
glad
.
 
<EOS>
But
next
moment
he
was
sorry
again
,
for
he
saw
tears
standing
in
her
poor
dim
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
"
said
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
nothing
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
've
brought
home
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
ill
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
only
a
little
swipey
,
you
know
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
reeled
in
his
boots
,
to
express
intoxication
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
come
from
Mrs
Todgers
's
?
"
asked
Merry
,
trembling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Todgers
's
,
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
No
!
"
cried
Mr
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
got
nothin
,
to
do
with
Todgers
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
cut
that
connection
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
been
a
-
dining
with
my
governor
at
the
west
-
end
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
know
he
was
a
-
coming
to
see
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
,
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
We
're
heavy
swells
too
,
and
so
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
come
out
,
a
-
catching
cold
in
your
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wake
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
expressing
in
his
demeanour
a
perfect
confidence
that
he
could
carry
him
in
with
ease
,
if
necessary
,
opened
the
coach
door
,
let
down
the
steps
,
and
giving
Jonas
a
shake
,
cried
"
We
've
got
home
,
my
flower
!
<EOS>
Tumble
up
,
then
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
respond
to
this
appeal
,
and
to
come
stumbling
out
of
the
coach
in
a
heap
,
to
the
great
hazard
of
Mr
Bailey
's
person
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
got
upon
the
pavement
,
Mr
Bailey
first
butted
at
him
in
front
,
and
then
dexterously
propped
him
up
behind
;
and
having
steadied
him
by
these
means
,
he
assisted
him
into
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
go
up
first
with
the
light
,
"
said
Bailey
to
Mr
Jonas
,
"
and
we
'll
foller
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
tremble
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
hurt
you
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
've
had
a
drop
too
much
,
I
'm
full
of
good
natur
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
went
on
before
;
and
her
husband
and
Bailey
,
by
dint
of
tumbling
over
each
other
,
and
knocking
themselves
about
,
got
at
last
into
the
sitting
-
room
above
stairs
,
where
Jonas
staggered
into
a
seat
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mr
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
all
right
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
got
nothing
to
cry
for
,
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
righter
than
a
trivet
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
ill
-
favoured
brute
,
with
dress
<EOS>
awry
,
and
sodden
face
,
and
rumpled
hair
,
sat
blinking
and
drooping
,
and
rolling
his
idiotic
eyes
about
,
until
,
becoming
conscious
by
degrees
,
he
recognized
his
wife
,
and
shook
his
fist
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Bailey
,
squaring
his
arms
with
a
sudden
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
you
're
wicious
,
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
though
!
 
<EOS>
You
'd
better
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
go
away
!
"
said
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bailey
,
my
good
boy
,
go
home
.
<EOS>
Jonas
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
;
timidly
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
bending
her
head
down
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jonas
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
her
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
pushing
her
off
with
his
extended
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Look
here
!
 
<EOS>
Look
at
her
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
bargain
for
a
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Jonas
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Devil
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
with
a
fierce
gesture
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
pretty
clog
to
be
tied
to
a
man
for
life
,
you
mewling
,
white
-
faced
cat
!
<EOS>
Get
out
of
my
sight
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
n't
mean
it
,
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
say
it
if
you
were
sober
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
affected
gayety
she
gave
Bailey
a
piece
of
money
,
and
again
implored
him
to
be
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Her
entreaty
was
so
earnest
,
that
the
boy
had
not
the
heart
to
stay
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
and
listened
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
say
it
if
I
was
sober
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
Have
I
never
said
it
when
I
was
sober
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Often
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
through
her
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
ye
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
made
me
bear
your
pretty
humours
once
,
and

'll
make
you
bear
mine
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
promised
myself
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
married
you
that
I
might
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
know
who
's
master
,
and
who
's
slave
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
I
am
obedient
!
"
said
the
sobbing
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
more
so
than
I
ever
thought
to
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
laughed
in
his
drunken
exultation
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
're
finding
it
out
,
are
you
!
 
<EOS>
Patience
,
and
you
will
in
time
!
 
<EOS>
Griffins
have
claws
,
my
girl
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
not
a
pretty
slight
you
ever
put
upon
me
,
nor
a
pretty
trick
you
ever
played
me
,
nor
a
pretty
insolence
you
ever
showed
me
,
that
I
wo
n't
pay
back
a
hundred
-
fold
.
 
<EOS>
What
else
did
I
marry
you
for
?
 
<EOS>
YOU
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
coarse
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
It
might
have
softened
him
---
indeed
it
might
---
to
hear
her
turn
a
little
fragment
of
a
song
he
used
to
say
he
liked
;
trying
,
with
a
heart
so
full
,
to
win
him
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
you
're
deaf
,
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
hear
me
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
myself
,
for
having
,
been
fool
enough
to
strap
a
pack
upon
my
back
for
the
pleasure
of
treading
on
it
whenever
I
choose
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
things
have
opened
to
me
,
now
,
so
that
I
might
marry
almost
where
I
liked
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
would
n't
;
I
'd
keep
single
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
single
,
among
the
friends
I
know
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
that
,
here
I
am
,
tied
like
a
log
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Pah
!
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
show
your
pale
face
when
I
come
home
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
never
to
forget
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
late
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
cheerfully
,
opening
the
shutter
after
an
interval
of
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Broad
day
,
Jonas
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Broad
day
or
black
night
,
what
do
I
care
!
"
was
the
kind
rejoinder
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
night
passed
quickly
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
sitting
up
,
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
up
for
me
again
,
if
you
dare
!
"
<EOS>
growled
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
reading
,
"
she
proceeded
,
"
all
night
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
when
you
went
out
,
and
read
till
you
came
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
strangest
story
,
Jonas
!
 
<EOS>
And
true
,
the
book
says
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
it
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
was
it
?
"
said
Jonas
,
doggedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
the
book
says
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Was
there
anything
in
it
,
about
a
man
's
being
determined
to
conquer
his
wife
,
break
her
spirit
,
bend
her
temper
,
crush
all
her
humours
like
so
many
nut
-
shells
---
kill
her
,
for
aught
I
know
?
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
Not
a
word
,
"
she
answered
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
'll
be
a
true
story
though
,
before
long
;
for
all
the
book
says
nothing
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
lying
book
<EOS>
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
A
fit
book
for
a
lying
reader
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
're
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
interval
of
silence
;
and
the
boy
was
stealing
away
,
when
he
heard
her
footstep
on
the
floor
,
and
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
him
,
as
it
seemed
,
and
spoke
lovingly
;
saying
that
she
would
defer
to
him
in
everything
and
would
consult
his
wishes
and
obey
them
,
and
they
might
be
very
happy
if
he
would
be
gentle
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
answered
with
an
imprecation
,
and
---
    
Not
with
a
blow
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Stern
truth
against
the
base
-
souled
villain
;
with
a
blow
.
   
<EOS>
No
angry
cries
;
no
loud
reproaches
.
 
<EOS>
Even
her
weeping
and
her
sobs
were
stifled
by
her
clinging
round
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
said
,
repeating
it
in
agony
of
heart
,
how
could
he
,
could
he
,
could
he
---
and
lost
utterance
in
tears
.
   
<EOS>
Oh
woman
,
God
beloved
in
old
Jerusalem
!
 
<EOS>
The
best
among
us
need
deal
lightly
with
thy
faults
,
if
only
for
the
punishment
thy
nature
will
endure
,
in
bearing
heavy
evidence
against
us
,
on
the
Day
of
Judgment
!

Chapter
29
.
<EOS>
In
which
some
people
are
precocious
,
others
professional
,
and
others
mysterious
;
all
in
their
several
ways
 
It
may
have
been
the
restless
remembrance
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
overnight
,
or
it
may
have
been
no
deeper
mental
operation
than
the
discovery
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
which
caused
Mr
Bailey
,
on
the
following
afternoon
,
to
feel
particularly
disposed
for
agreeable
society
,
and
prompted
him
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
friend
Poll
Sweedlepipe
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
little
bell
giving
clamorous
notice
of
a
visitor
's
approach
(
for
Mr
Bailey
came
in
at
the
door
with
a
lunge
,
to
get
as
much
sound
out
of
the
bell
as
possible
)
,
Poll
Sweedlepipe
desisted
from
the
contemplation
of
a
favourite
owl
,
and
gave
his
young
friend
hearty
welcome
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
look
smarter
by
day
,
"
said
Poll
,
"
than
you
do
by
candle
-
light
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
tight
young
dasher
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Reether
so
,
Polly
.
 
<EOS>
How
's
our
fair
friend
,
Sairah
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
's
pretty
well
,
"
said
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
at
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
remains
of
a
fine
woman
about
Sairah
,
Poll
,
"
observed
Mr
Bailey
,
with
genteel
indifference
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
thought
Poll
,
"
he
's
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
be
very
old
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
much
crumb
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Bailey
;
"
too
fat
,
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
's
many
worse
at
her
time
of
life
"
   
"
<EOS>
The
very
owl
's
a
-
opening
his
eyes
!
"
thought
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
in
a
bird
of
his
opinions
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
happened
to
have
been
sharpening
his
razors
,
which
were
lying
open
in
a
row
,
while
a
huge
strop
dangled
from
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
at
these
preparations
,
Mr
Bailey
stroked
his
chin
,
and
a
thought
appeared
to
occur
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poll
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
ai
n't
as
neat
as
I
could
wish
about
the
gills
.
<EOS>
Being
here
,
I
may
as
well
have
a
shave
,
and
get
trimmed
close
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
barber
stood
aghast
;
but
Mr
Bailey
divested
himself
of
his
neck
-
cloth
,
and
sat
down
in
the
easy
shaving
chair
with
all
the
dignity
and
confidence
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
resisting
his
manner
.
 
<EOS>
The
evidence
of
sight
and
touch
became
as
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
His
chin
was
as
smooth
as
a
new
-
laid
egg
or
a
scraped
Dutch
cheese
;
but
Poll
Sweedlepipe
would
n't
have
ventured
to
deny
,
on
affidavit
,
that
he
had
the
beard
of
a
Jewish
rabbi
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
WITH
the
grain
,
Poll
,
all
round
,
please
,
"
said
Mr
Bailey
,
screwing
up
his
face
for
the
reception
of
the
lather
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
do
wot
you
like
with
the
bits
of
whisker
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
for
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
meek
little
barber
stood
gazing
at
him
with
the
brush
and
soap
-
dish
in
his
hand
,
stirring
them
round
and
round
in
a
ludicrous
uncertainty
,
as
if
he
were
disabled
by
some
fascination
from
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
made
a
dash
at
Mr
Bailey
's
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
stopped
again
,
as
if
the
ghost
of
a
beard
had
suddenly
receded
from
his
touch
;
but
receiving
mild
encouragement
from
Mr
Bailey
,
in
the
form
of
an
adjuration
to
"
Go
in
and
win
,
"
he
lathered
him
bountifully
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
smiled
through
the
suds
in
his
satisfaction
.
"
<EOS>
Gently
over
the
stones
,
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
Go
a
tip
-
toe
over
the
pimples
!
"
   
<EOS>
Poll
Sweedlepipe
obeyed
,
and
scraped
the
lather
off
again
with
particular
care
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
squinted
at
every
successive
dab
,
as
it
was
deposited
on
a
cloth
on
his
left
shoulder
,
and
seemed
,
with
a
microscopic
eye
,
to
detect
some
bristles
in
it
;
for
he
murmured
more
than
once
"
Reether
redder
than
I
could
wish
,
Poll
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
operation
being
concluded
,
Poll
fell
back
and
stared
at
him
again
,
while
Mr
Bailey
,
wiping
his
face
on
the
jack
-
towel
,
remarked
,
"
<EOS>
that
arter
late
hours
nothing
freshened
up
a
man
so
much
as
a
easy
shave
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
act
of
tying
his
cravat
at
the
glass
,
without
his
coat
,
and
Poll
had
wiped
his
razor
,
ready
for
the
next
customer
,
when
Mrs
Gamp
,
coming
downstairs
,
looked
in
at
the
shop
-
door
to
give
the
barber
neighbourly
good
day
.
 
<EOS>
Feeling
for
her
unfortunate
situation
,
in
having
conceived
a
regard
for
himself
which
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
things
that
he
could
return
,
Mr
Bailey
hastened
to
soothe
her
with
words
of
kindness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
Sairah
!
 
<EOS>
I
need
n't
ask
you
how
you
've
been
this
long
time
,
for
you
're
in
full
bloom
.
 
<EOS>
All
a
-
blowin
and
a
-
growin
;
ai
n't
she
,
Polly
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
drat
the
Bragian
boldness
of
that
boy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
though
not
displeased
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
imperent
young
sparrow
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
that
creetur
's
mother
not
for
fifty
pound
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
regarded
this
as
a
delicate
confession
of
her
attachment
,
and
a
hint
that
no
pecuniary
gain
could
recompense
her
for
its
being
rendered
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
flattered
.
 
<EOS>
Disinterested
affection
is
always
flattering
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
moaned
Mrs
Gamp
,
sinking
into
the
shaving
chair
,
"
that
there
blessed
Bull
,
Mr
Sweedlepipe
,
has
done
his
wery
best
to
conker
me
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
trying
inwalieges
in
this
walley
of
the
shadder
,
that
one
beats
'em
black
and
blue
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
practice
of
Mrs
Gamp
and
her
friends
in
the
profession
,
to
say
this
of
all
the
easy
customers
;
as
having
at
once
the
effect
of
discouraging
competitors
for
office
,
and
accounting
for
the
necessity
of
high
living
on
the
part
of
the
nurses
.
   
<EOS>
"
Talk
of
constitooshun
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
person
's
constitooshun
need
be
made
of
bricks
to
stand
it

<EOS>
Mrs
Harris
jestly
says
to
me
,
but
t'other
day
,
"
Oh

<EOS>
Sairey
Gamp

"
she
says
,
"
how
is
it
done

"
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Harris
,

"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
barber
gave
a
soft
murmur
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
Mrs
Harris
's
remark
,
though
perhaps
not
quite
so
intelligible
as
could
be
desired
from
such
an
authority
,
did
equal
honour
to
her
head
and
to
her
heart

You

Worrit

<EOS>
cried
Mrs

,
raising
her
hands
and
turning
up
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
speak
truth
in
that
,
sir
,
if

never

twixt
this

Sundays

<EOS>
I
feels
the

more

I
feels
my

though
no

may
n't
suppoge

<EOS>
The

said
Mrs

,
"
if
all
was
knowd

credit
done

<EOS>
"
Where
's
the

goin

"
asked
Sweedlepipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Into
Har'fordshire
,
which
is
his
native
air
.
 
<EOS>
But
native
airs
nor
native
graces
<EOS>
neither
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
observed
,
"
wo
n't
bring
HIM
round
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
bad
as
that
?
"
inquired
the
wistful
barber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
shook
her
head
mysteriously
,
and
pursed
up
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
fevers
of
the
mind
,
"
she
said
,
"
as
well
as
body

<EOS>
You
may
take
your

you
wo

that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
barber
,
opening
his
eyes
,
and
putting
on
his
raven
aspect
;
"
Lor
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
You
may
make
yourself
as
light
as

"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
talk
,
when
you
're
wrong
in
your
head
and
when
you
're
in
your
sleep

of
certain
things
;
and
you
'll
be
heavy
in
your

"
   
<EOS>
"
Of

kind
of

now

"
inquired
Poll
,
greedily
biting
his
nails
in
his
great
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ghosts
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
,
who
perhaps
had
been
already
tempted
further
than
she
had
intended
to
go
,
by
the
barber
's
stimulating
curiosity
,
gave
a
sniff
of
uncommon
significance
,
and
said
,
it
did
n't
signify
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
goin
down
with
my
patient
in

coach
this
arternoon

she
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a

goin

stop
with
him
a

so

till
he
gets
a

nuss
(
drat

then
I
'm
a

comin

that
's
my

Mr
Sweedlepipes

<EOS>
But
I
hope
that
everythink'll
only
go
on

comfortable
as

"
   
<EOS>
During
the
progress
of
the
foregoing
remarks
,
which
Mrs
Gamp
had
addressed
exclusively
to
the
barber
,
Mr
Bailey
had
been
tying
his
cravat
,
getting
on
his
coat
,
and
making
hideous
faces
at
himself
in
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Being
now
personally
addressed
by
Mrs
Gamp
,
he
turned
round
,
and
mingled
in
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ai
n't
been
in
the
City
,
I
suppose
,
<EOS>
sir
,
since
we
was
all
three
there
together

said
Mrs

,
"
at
Mr

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

I

<EOS>
I
was
there
last

"
   
"
<EOS>
Last

cried
the
barber
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Poll
,
reether
so
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
call
it
this
morning
,
if
you
like
to
be
particular

<EOS>
He
dined
with

.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
does
that
young
Limb
mean
by

"
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
most
impatient
emphasis
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
and
my
Governor
,
Sairah

<EOS>
He
dined
at
our
house

<EOS>
We
wos
very
merry
,
Sairah
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
so
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
see
him
home
in
a
hackney
coach
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
tip
of
the
boy
's
tongue
to
relate
what
had
followed
;
but
remembering
how
easily
it
might
be
carried
to
his
master
's
ears
,
and
the
repeated
cautions
he
had
had
from
Mr
Crimple
"
not
to
chatter
,
"
he
checked
himself
;
adding
,
only
,
"
She
was
sitting
up
,
expecting
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
all
things
considered
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
sharply
,
"
she
might
have
know'd
better
than
to
go
a
-
tirin
herself
out
,
by
doin'
anythink
of
the
sort

<EOS>
Did
they
seem
pretty
pleasant
together
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
answered
Bailey
,
"
pleasant
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
on
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
a
second
sniff
of
significance
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
n't
been
married
so
long
,
"
observed
Poll
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
"
that
they
need
be
anything
but
pleasant
yet
awhile
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
a
third
significant
signal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Especially
,
"
pursued
the
barber
,
"
when
the
gentleman
bears
such
a
character
as
you
gave
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
speak
;
as
I
find
,
Mr
Sweedlepipes
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forbid
it
should
be
otherways
!
 
<EOS>
But
we
never
knows
wot
's
hidden
in
each
other
's
hearts
;
and
if
we
had
glass
winders
there
,
we
'd
need
keep
the
shetters
up
,
some
on
us
,
I
do
assure
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
---
"
Poll
Sweedlepipe
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
cutting
him
very
short
,
"
I
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
The
torters
of
the
Imposition
should
n't
make
me
own
I
did
.
<EOS>
All
I
says
is
,
"
added
the
good
woman
,
rising
and
folding
her
shawl
about
her
,
"
that
the
Bull
's
a
-
waitin
,
and
the
precious
moments
is
a
-
flyin

fast

"
   
<EOS>
The
little
barber
having
in
his
eager
curiosity
a
great
desire
to
see
Mrs
Gamp
's
patient
,
proposed
to
Mr
Bailey
that
they
should
accompany
her
to
the
Bull
,
and
witness
the
departure
of
the
coach
.
<EOS>
That
young
gentleman
assenting
,
they
all
went
out
together
.
   
<EOS>
Arriving
at
the
tavern
,
Mrs
Gamp
(
who
was
full
-
dressed
for
the
journey
,
in
her
latest
suit
of
mourning
)
left
her
friends
to
entertain
themselves
in
the
yard
,
while
she
ascended
to
the
sick
room
,
where
her
fellow
-
labourer
Mrs
Prig
was
dressing
the
invalid
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
so
wasted
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
his
bones
would
rattle
when
they
moved
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
cheeks
were
sunken
,
and
his
eyes
unnaturally
large
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
back
in
the
easy
-
chair
like
one
more
dead
than
living
;
and
rolled
his
languid
eyes
towards
the
door
when
Mrs
Gamp
appeared
,
as
painfully
as
if
their
weight
alone
were
burdensome
to
move
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
are
we
by
this
time
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
looks
charming
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
looks
a
deal
charminger
than
we
are
,
then
,
"
returned
Mrs
Prig
,
a
little
chafed
in
her
temper
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
got
out
of
bed
back'ards
,
I
think
,
for
we
're
as
cross
as
two
sticks
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
sich
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
n't
have
been
washed
,
if
he
'd
had
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
put
the
soap
in
my
mouth
,
"
said
the
unfortunate
patient
feebly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
you
keep
it
shut
then
?
"
retorted
Mrs
Prig
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
do
you
think
's
to
wash
one
feater
,
and
miss
another
,
and
wear
one
's
eyes
out
with
all
manner
of
fine
work
of
that
description
,
for
half
-
a
-
crown
a
day
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
wants
to
be
tittivated
,
you
must
pay
accordin
'
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
!
"
cried
the
patient
,
"
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mrs
Prig
,
"
that
's
the
way
he
's
been
a
-
conductin
of
himself
,
Sarah
,
ever
since
I
got
him
out
of
bed
,
if
you
'll
believe
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Instead
of
being
grateful
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
observed
,
"
for
all
our
little
ways
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
fie
for
shame
,
sir
,
fie
for
shame
!
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Prig
seized
the
patient
by
the
chin
,
and
began
to
rasp
his
unhappy
head
with
a
hair
-
brush
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
do
n't
like
that
,
neither
!
"
<EOS>
she
observed
,
stopping
to
look
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
just
possible
that
he
did
n't
for
the
brush
was
a
specimen
of
the
hardest
kind
of
instrument
producible
by
modern
art
;
and
his
very
eyelids
were
red
with
the
friction
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Prig
was
gratified
to
observe
the
correctness
of
her
supposition
,
and
said
triumphantly
"
she
know'd
as
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
his
hair
was
smoothed
down
comfortably
into
his
eyes
,
Mrs
Prig
and
Mrs
Gamp
put
on
his
neckerchief
;
adjusting
his
shirt
collar
with
great
nicety
,
so
that
the
starched
points
should
also
invade
those
organs
,
and
afflict
them
with
an
artificial
ophthalmia
.
 
<EOS>
His
waistcoat
and
coat
were
next
arranged
;
and
as
every
button
was
wrenched
into
a
wrong
button
-
hole
,
and
the
order
of
his
boots
was
reversed
,
he
presented
on
the
whole
rather
a
melancholy
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
's
right
,
"
said
the
poor
weak
invalid
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
as
if
I
was
in
somebody
else
's
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
all
on
one
side
;
and
you
've
made
one
of
my
legs
shorter
than
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
bottle
in
my
pocket
too
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
make
me
sit
upon
a
bottle
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Deuce
take
the
man
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
drawing
it
forth
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
ai
n't
been
and
got
my
night
-
bottle
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
little
cupboard
of
his
coat
when
it
hung
behind
the
door
,
and
quite
forgot
it
,
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
find
a
ingun
or
two
,
and
a
little
tea
and
sugar
in
his
t'other
pocket
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
you
'll
just
be
good
enough
to
take
'em
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
Betsey
produced
the
property
in
question
,
together
with
some
other
articles
of
general
chandlery
;
and
Mrs
Gamp
transferred
them
to
her
own
pocket
,
which
was
a
species
of
nankeen
pannier
.
 
<EOS>
Refreshment
then
arrived
in
the
form
of
chops
and
strong
ale
for
the
ladies
,
and
a
basin
of
beef
-
tea
for
the
patient
;
which
refection
was
barely
at
an
end
when
John
Westlock
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
Up
and
dressed
!
"
cried
John
,
sitting
down
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
brave
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
feel
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Much
better
.
 
<EOS>
But
very
weak
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
had
a
hard
bout
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
country
air
,
and
change
of
scene
,
"
said
John
,
"
will
make
another
man
of
you
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
he
added
,
laughing
,
as
he
kindly
arranged
the
sick
man
's
garments
,
"
you
have
odd
notions
of
a
gentleman
's
dress
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Lewsome
an't
a
easy
gent
to
get
into
his
clothes
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
replied
with
dignity
;
"
as
me
and
Betsey
Prig
can
certify
afore
the
Lord
Mayor
and
Uncommon
Counsellors
,
if
needful
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
at
that
moment
was
standing
close
in
front
of
the
sick
man
,
in
the
act
of
releasing
him
from
the
torture
of
the
collars
before
mentioned
,
when
he
said
in
a
whisper
:
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Westlock
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
overheard
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
something
very
particular
and
strange
to
say
to
you
;
something
that
has
been
a
dreadful
weight
on
my
mind
,
through
this
long
illness
.
"
   
<EOS>
Quick
in
all
his
motions
,
John
was
turning
round
to
desire
the
women
to
leave
the
room
;
when
the
sick
man
held
him
by
the
sleeve
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
not
the
strength
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
not
the
courage
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
tell
it
when
I
have
?
 
<EOS>
May
I
write
it
,
if
I
find
that
easier
and
better
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
you
!
"
cried
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Lewsome

Do

<EOS>
It
's
unnatural
and
cruel

Frightful

Frightful

<EOS>
At
first
,
John
gazed
at
him
in
great
surprise
;
but
remembering
how
very
much
reduced
he
was
,
and
how
recently
his
brain
had
been
on
fire
with
fever
,
believed
that
he
was
labouring
under
some
imaginary
horror
or
despondent
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
For
farther
information
on
this
point
,
he
took
an
opportunity
of
drawing
Mrs
Gamp
aside
,
while
Betsey
Prig
was
wrapping
him
in
cloaks
and
shawls
,
and
asked
her
whether
he
was
quite
collected
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
bless
you
,
no
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
hates
his
nusses
to
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
They
always
does
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
certain
sign
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
could
have
heerd
the
poor
dear
soul
<EOS>
a
-
findin
fault
with
me
and
Betsey
Prig
,
<EOS>
not
half
an
hour
ago
,
you
would
have
wondered
how
it
is
we
do
n't
get
fretted
to
the
tomb
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
almost
confirmed
John
in
his
suspicion
;
so
,
not
taking
what
had
passed
into
any
serious
account
,
he
resumed
his
former
cheerful
manner
,
and
assisted
by
Mrs
Gamp
and
Betsey
Prig
,
conducted
Lewsome
downstairs
to
the
coach
;
just
then
upon
the
point
of
starting
.
<EOS>
Poll
Sweedlepipe
was
at
the
door
with
his
arms
tight
folded
and
his
eyes
wide
open
,
and
looked
on
with
absorbing
interest
,
while
the
sick
man
was
slowly
moved
into
the
vehicle
.
 
<EOS>
His
bony
hands
and
haggard
face
impressed
Poll
wonderfully
;
and
he
informed
Mr
Bailey
in
confidence
,
that
he
would
n't
have
missed
seeing
him
for
a
pound
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
,
who
was
of
a
different
constitution
,
remarked
that
he
would
have
stayed
away
for
five
shillings
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
troublesome
matter
to
adjust
Mrs
Gamp
's
luggage
to
her
satisfaction
;
for
every
package
belonging
to
that
lady
had
the
inconvenient
property
of
requiring
to
be
put
in
a
boot
by
itself
,
and
to
have
no
other
luggage
near
it
,
on
pain
of
actions
at
law
for
heavy
damages
against
the
proprietors
of
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
The
umbrella
with
the
circular
patch
was
particularly
hard
to
be
got
rid
of
,
and
several
times
thrust
out
its
battered
brass
nozzle
from
improper
crevices
and
chinks
,
to
the
great
terror
of
the
other
passengers
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
in
her
intense
anxiety
to
find
a
haven
of
refuge
for
this
chattel
,
Mrs
Gamp
so
often
moved
it
,
in
the
course
of
five
minutes
,
that
it
seemed
not
one
umbrella
but
fifty
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
it
was
lost
,
or
said
to
be
;
and
for
the
next
five
minutes
she
was
face
to
face
with
the
coachman
,
go
wherever
he
might
,
protesting
that
it
should
be
"
made
good
,
"
though
she
took
the
question
to
the
House
of
Commons
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
,
her
bundle
,
and
her
pattens
,
and
her
basket
,
and
everything
else
,
<EOS>
being
disposed
of
<EOS>
,
she
took
a
friendly
leave
of
Poll
and
Mr
Bailey
,
dropped
a
curtsey
to
John
Westlock
,
and
parted
as
from
a
cherished
member
of
the
sisterhood
with
Betsey
Prig
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wishin

Mrs

observed

<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
how
soon
it
is

"
said
Mrs
Prig
;
"
nor
how
many
weeks
it
lasts

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
with
a
reply
in
a
congenial
spirit
was
backing
to
the
coach
,
when
she
came
in
contact
with
a
lady
and
gentleman
who
were
passing
along
the
footway
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
care
,
take
care
here

"
cried
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloo
!
<EOS>
My
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
Mrs
Gamp
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
Mr
Mould
!
"
exclaimed
the
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
Mrs
Mould
!
who
would
have
thought
as
we
should
ever
have
a
meetin

here

I
'm
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
out
of
town
,
Mrs
Gamp
?
"
cried
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
unusual
,
is
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
IS
unusual
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
only
for
a
day
or
two
at
most
.
 
<EOS>
The
gent
,
"
she
whispered
,
"
as
I
spoke
about
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
in
the
coach
!
"
cried
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
one
you
thought
of
recommending
?
 
<EOS>
Very
odd
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
this
will
interest
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
that
Mrs
Gamp
thought
likely
to
suit
us
is
in
the
coach
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Mould
was
greatly
interested
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
stand
upon
the
door
-
step
,
"
said
Mould
,
"
and
take
a
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
There
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
my
glass
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
him
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
plain
,
"
said
Mrs
Mould
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
,
you
know
,
this
is
a
very
singular
circumstance
,
"
said
Mould
,
quite
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
sort
of
thing
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
would
n't
have
missed
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
It
tickles
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
almost
a
little
play
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
There
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Looks
poorly
,
Mrs
M
,
do
n't
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Mould
assented
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
coming
our
way
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
"
said
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
knows
!
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
ought
to
show
him
some
little
attention
,
really
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
n't
seem
a
stranger
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
much
inclined
to
move
my
hat
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
looking
hard
this
way
,
"
said
Mrs
Mould
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
!
"
cried
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
day
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
He
bows
too
.
 
<EOS>
Very
gentlemanly
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
has
the
cards
in
her
pocket
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
very
singular
,
my
dear
---
and
very
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
superstitious
,
but
it
really
seems
as
if
one
was
destined
to
pay
him
those
little
melancholy
civilities
which
belong
to
our
peculiar
line
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
kind
of
objection
to
your
kissing
your
hand
to
him
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Mould
did
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
said
Mould
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
evidently
gratified
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
glad
you
did
it
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Bye
bye
,
Mrs
Gamp
!
"
waving
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
he
goes
;
there
he
goes
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
he
did
;
for
the
coach
rolled
off
as
the
words
were
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Mould
,
in
high
good
humour
,
went
their
merry
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
retired
with
Poll
Sweedlepipe
as
soon
as
possible
;
but
some
little
time
elapsed
before
he
could
remove
his
friend
from
the
ground
,
owing
to
the
impression
wrought
upon
the
barber
's
nerves
by
Mrs
Prig
,
whom
he
pronounced
,
in
admiration
of
her
beard
,
to
be
a
woman
of
transcendent
charms
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
light
cloud
of
bustle
hanging
round
the
coach
was
thus
dispersed
,
Nadgett
was
seen
in
the
darkest
box
of
the
Bull
coffee
-
room
,
looking
wistfully
up
at
the
clock
---
as
if
the
man
who
never
appeared
were
a
little
behind
his
time
.

Chapter
30

<EOS>
Proves
that
changes
may
be
rung
in
the
best
-
regulated
families
,
and
that
Mr
Peckniff
was
a
special
hand
at
a
Triple
-
bob
-
major
 
<EOS>
As
the
surgeon
's
first
care
after
amputating
a
limb
,
is
to
take
up
the
arteries
the
cruel
knife
has
severed
,
so
it
is
the
duty
of
this
history
,
which
in
its
remorseless
course
has
cut
from
the
Pecksniffian
trunk
its
right
arm
,
Mercy
,
to
look
to
the
parent
stem
,
and
see
how
in
all
its
various
ramifications
it
got
on
without
her
.
   
<EOS>
And
first
of
Mr
Pecksniff
it
may
be
observed
,
that
having
provided
for
his
youngest
daughter
that
choicest
of
blessings
,
a
tender
and
indulgent
husband
;
and
having
gratified
the
dearest
wish
of
his
parental
heart
by
establishing
her
in
life
so
happily
;
he
renewed
his
youth
,
and
spreading
the
plumage
of
his
own
bright
conscience
,
felt
himself
equal
to
all
kinds
of
flights
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
customary
with
fathers
in
stage
-
plays
,
after
giving
their
daughters
to
the
men
of
their
hearts
,
to
congratulate
themselves
on
having
no
other
business
on
their
hands
but
to
die
immediately
;
though
it
is
rarely
found
that
they
are
in
a
hurry
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
being
a
father
of
a
more
sage
and
practical
class
,
appeared
to
think
that
his
immediate
business
was
to
live
;
and
having
deprived
himself
of
one
comfort
,
to
surround
himself
with
others
.
   
<EOS>
But
however
much
inclined
the
good
man
was
to
be
jocose
and
playful
,
and
in
the
garden
of
his
fancy
to
disport
himself
(
if
one
may
say
so
)
like
an
architectural
kitten
,
he
had
one
impediment
constantly
opposed
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentle
Cherry
,
stung
by
a
sense
of
slight
and
injury
,
which
far
from
softening
down
or
wearing
out
,
rankled
and
festered
in
her
heart
---
the
gentle
Cherry
was
in
flat
rebellion
.
<EOS>
She
waged
fierce
war
against
her
dear
papa
,
she
led
her
parent
what
is
usually
called
,
for
want
of
a
better
figure
of
speech
,
the
life
of
a
dog
.
 
<EOS>
But
never
did
that
dog
live
,
in
kennel
,
stable
-
yard
,
or
house
,
whose
life
was
half
as
hard
as
Mr
Pecksniff
's
with
his
gentle
child
.
   
<EOS>
The
father
and
daughter
were
sitting
at
their
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
had
retired
,
and
they
were
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
frowned
at
first
;
but
having
cleared
his
brow
,
looked
stealthily
at
his
child
.
 
<EOS>
Her
nose
was
very
red
indeed
,
and
screwed
up
tight
,
with
hostile
preparation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cherry
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
what
is
amiss
between
us
?
 
<EOS>
My
child
,
why
are
we
disunited
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
's
answer
was
scarcely
a
response
to
this
gush
of
affection
,
for
it
was
simply
,
"
Bother
,
Pa
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bother
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
a
tone
of
anguish
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
tis
too
late
,
Pa
,
"
said
his
daughter
,
calmly
"
to
talk
to
me
like
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
it
means
,
and
what
its
value
is
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
hard
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
addressing
his
breakfast
-
cup
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
hard
!
 
<EOS>
She
is
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
carried
her
in
my
arms
when
she
wore
shapeless
worsted
shoes
---
I
might
say
,
mufflers
---
many
years
ago
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
taunt
me
with
that
,
Pa
,
"
retorted
Cherry
,
with
a
spiteful
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
so
many
years
older
than
my
sister
,
either
,
though
she
IS
married
to
your
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
human
nature
,
human
nature
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
human
nature
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shaking
his
head
at
human
nature
,
as
if
he
did
n't
belong
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
think
that
this
discord
should
arise
from
such
a
cause
!
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
From
such
a
cause
indeed
!
"
cried
Cherry
.
 
<EOS>
"
State
the
real
cause
,
Pa
,
or
I
'll
state
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
!
"
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
energy
with
which
she
said
this
was
infectious
.
 
<EOS>
However
that
may
be
,
Mr
Pecksniff
changed
his
tone
and
the
expression
of
his
face
for
one
of
anger
,
if
not
downright
violence
,
when
he
said
:
   
"
You
will
!
<EOS>
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
always
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
decency
;
you
make
no
secret
of
your
temper
;
you
have
exposed
yourself
to
Mr
Chuzzlewit
a
hundred
times
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Myself

"
cried
Cherry
,
with
a
bitter
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
,
too
,
then
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
His
daughter
answered
with
a
scornful
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
since
we
have
come
to
an
explanation
,
Charity
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
rolling
his
head
portentously
,
"
let
me
tell
you
that
I
wo
n't
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
your
nonsense
,
Miss
!
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
permit
it
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
,
"
said
Charity
,
rocking
her
chair
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
raising
her
voice
to
a
high
pitch
,
"
I
shall
do
,
Pa
,
what
I
please
and
what
I
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
be
crushed
in
everything
,
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
more
shamefully
used
than
anybody
ever
was
in
this
world
,
"
here
she
began
to
cry
and
sob
,
"
and
may
expect
the
worse
treatment
from
you
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
care
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
made
so
desperate
by
the
loud
tone
in
which
she
spoke
,
that
,
after
looking
about
him
in
frantic
uncertainty
for
some
means
of
softening
it
,
he
rose
and
shook
her
until
the
ornamental
bow
of
hair
upon
her
head
nodded
like
a
plume
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
very
much
astonished
by
this
assault
,
that
it
really
had
the
desired
effect
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
it
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
he
resumed
his
seat
and
fetched
his
breath
,
"
if
you
dare
to
talk
in
that
loud
manner
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
mean
about
being
shamefully
used
?
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Jonas
chose
your
sister
in
preference
to
you
,
who
could
help
it
,
I
should
wish
to
know
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
I
made
a
convenience
of
?
 
<EOS>
Were
n't
my
feelings
trifled
with
?
<EOS>
Did
n't
he
address
himself
to
me
first
?
"
<EOS>
sobbed
Cherry
,
clasping
her
hands
;
"
and
oh
,
good
gracious
,
that
I
should
live
to
be
shook
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
live
to
be
shaken
again
,
"
returned
her
parent
,
"
if
you
drive
me
to
that
means
of
maintaining
the
decorum
of
this
humble
roof
.
<EOS>
You
surprise
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
have
not
more
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Jonas
did
n't
care
for
you
,
how
could
you
wish
to
have
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
have
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Cherry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
have
him
,
Pa
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
what
are
you
making
all
this
piece
of
work
for
,
"
retorted
her
father
,
"
if
you
did
n't
wish
to
have
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
was
treated
with
duplicity
,
"
said
Cherry
;
"
and
because
my
own
sister
and
my
own
father
conspired
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
angry
with
HER
,
"
said
Cherry
;
looking
much
more
angry
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
pity
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
fate
that
's
in
store
for
her
,
with
that
Wretch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jonas
will
survive
your
calling
him
a
wretch
,
<EOS>
my
child
,
I
dare
say
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
returning
resignation
;
"
but
call
him
what
you
like
and
make
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
an
end
,
Pa
,
"
said
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
not
the
only
point
on
which
we
're
not
agreed
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
submit
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
better
you
should
know
that
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
I
wo
n't
submit
to
it
indeed
,
Pa
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
quite
a
fool
,
and
I
am
not
blind
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
have
got
to
say
is
,
I
wo
n't
submit
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Whatever
she
meant
,
she
shook
Mr
Pecksniff
now
;
for
his
lame
attempt
to
seem
composed
was
melancholy
in
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
His
anger
changed
to
meekness
,
and
his
words
were
mild
and
fawning
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
he
said
;
"
if
in
the
short
excitement
of
an
angry
moment
I
resorted
to
an
unjustifiable
means
of
suppressing
a
little
outbreak
calculated
to
injure
you
as
well
as
myself
---
it
's
possible
<EOS>
I
may
have
done
so
<EOS>
;
perhaps
I
did
---
I
ask
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
A
father
asking
pardon
of
his
child
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
is
,
I
believe
,
a
spectacle
to
soften
the
most
rugged
nature
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
it
did
n't
at
all
soften
Miss
Pecksniff
<EOS>
;
perhaps
because
her
nature
was
not
rugged
enough
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
she
persisted
in
saying
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
she
was
n't
quite
a
fool
,
and
was
n't
blind
,
and
would
n't
submit
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
labour
under
some
mistake
,
my
child
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
not
ask
you
what
it
is
;
I
do
n't
desire
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
pray
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
holding
out
his
hand
and
colouring
again
,
"
let
us
avoid
the
subject
,
my
dear
,
whatever
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
right
that
the
subject
should
be
avoided
between
us
,
sir
,
"
said
Cherry
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
wish
to
be
able
to
avoid
it
altogether
,
and
consequently
must
beg
you
to
provide
me
with
a
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
looked
about
the
room
,
and
said
,
"
A
home
,
my
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Another
home
,
papa
,
"
said
Cherry
,
with
increasing
stateliness
<EOS>
"
Place
me
at
Mrs
Todgers
's
or
somewhere
,
on
an
independent
footing
;
but
I
will
not
live
here
,
if
such
is
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
possible
that
Miss
Pecksniff
saw
in
Mrs
Todgers
's
a
vision
of
enthusiastic
men
,
pining
to
fall
in
adoration
at
her
feet
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
possible
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
his
new
-
born
juvenility
,
saw
,
in
the
suggestion
of
that
same
establishment
,
an
easy
means
of
relieving
himself
from
an
irksome
charge
in
the
way
of
temper
and
watchfulness
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
undoubtedly
a
fact
that
in
the
attentive
ears
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
the
proposition
did
not
sound
quite
like
the
dismal
knell
of
all
his
hopes
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
man
of
great
feeling
and
acute
sensibility
;
and
he
squeezed
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
against
his
eyes
with
both
hands
---
 
as
such
men
always
do
,
especially
when
they
are
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
my
birds
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
said
,
"
has
left
me
for
the
stranger
's
breast
;
the
other
would
take
wing
to
Todgers
's
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
what
am
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
am
,
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
!
"
   
<EOS>
Even
this
remark
,
made
more
pathetic
perhaps
by
his
breaking
down
in
the
middle
of
it
,
had
no
effect
upon
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
grim
,
rigid
,
and
inflexible
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
ever
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
sacrificed
my
children
's
happiness
to
my
own
<EOS>
---
I
mean
my
own
happiness
to
my
children
's
---
and
I
will
not
begin
to
regulate
my
life
by
other
rules
of
conduct
now
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
be
happier
at
Mrs
Todgers
's
than
in
your
father
's
house
,
my
dear
,
go
to
Mrs
Todgers
's
!
 
<EOS>
Do
not
think
of
me
,
my
girl
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
with
emotion
;
<EOS>
"
I
shall
get
on
pretty
well
,
no
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Charity
,
who
knew
he
had
a
secret
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
the
proposed
change
,
suppressed
her
own
,
and
went
on
to
negotiate
the
terms
.
 
<EOS>
His
views
upon
this
subject
were
at
first
so
very
limited
that
another
difference
,
involving
possibly
another
shaking
,
threatened
to
ensue
;
but
by
degrees
they
came
to
something
like
an
understanding
,
and
the
storm
blew
over
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Miss
Charity
's
idea
was
so
agreeable
to
both
,
that
it
would
have
been
strange
if
they
had
not
come
to
an
amicable
agreement
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
soon
arranged
between
them
that
the
project
should
be
tried
,
and
that
immediately
;
and
that
Cherry
's
not
being
well
,
and
needing
change
of
scene
,
and
wishing
to
be
near
her
sister
,
<EOS>
should
form
the
excuse
for
her
departure
to
Mr
Chuzzlewit
and
Mary
,
to
both
of
whom
she
had
pleaded
indisposition
for
some
time
past
.
 
<EOS>
These
premises
agreed
on
,
Mr
Pecksniff
gave
her
his
blessing
,
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
self
-
denying
man
who
had
made
a
hard
sacrifice
,
but
comforted
himself
with
the
reflection
that
virtue
is
its
own
reward
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
they
were
reconciled
for
the
first
time
since
that
not
easily
forgiven
night
,
when
Mr
Jonas
,
repudiating
the
elder
,
had
confessed
his
passion
for
the
younger
sister
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
had
abetted
him
on
moral
grounds
.
   
<EOS>
But
how
happened
it
---
in
the
name
of
an
unexpected
addition
to
that
small
family
,
the
Seven
Wonders
of
the
World
,
whatever
and
wherever
they
may
be
,
how
happened
it
---
that
Mr
Pecksniff
and
his
daughter
were
about
to
part
?
 
<EOS>
How
happened
it
that
their
mutual
relations
were
so
greatly
altered
?
 
<EOS>
Why
was
Miss
Pecksniff
so
clamorous
to
have
it
understood
that
she
was
neither
blind
nor
foolish
,
and
she
would
n't
bear
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
possible
that
Mr
Pecksniff
had
any
thoughts
of
marrying
again
;
or
that
his
daughter
,
with
the
sharp
eye
of
a
single
woman
,
fathomed
his
design
!
   
<EOS>
Let
us
inquire
into
this
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
a
man
without
reproach
,
from
whom
the
breath
of
slander
passed
like
common
breath
from
any
other
polished
surface
,
could
afford
to
do
what
common
men
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
the
purity
of
his
own
motives
;
and
when
he
had
a
motive
worked
at
it
as
only
a
very
good
man
(
or
a
very
bad
one
)
can
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
set
before
himself
any
strong
and
palpable
motives
for
taking
a
second
wife
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
not
one
or
two
of
them
,
but
a
combination
of
very
many
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
Chuzzlewit
had
gradually
undergone
an
important
change
.
<EOS>
Even
upon
the
night
when
he
made
such
an
ill
-
timed
arrival
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
,
he
was
comparatively
subdued
and
easy
to
deal
with
.
 
<EOS>
This
Mr
Pecksniff
attributed
,
at
the
time
,
to
the
effect
his
brother
's
death
had
had
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
from
that
hour
his
character
seemed
to
have
modified
by
regular
degrees
,
and
to
have
softened
down
into
a
dull
indifference
for
almost
every
one
but
Mr
Pecksniff
.
<EOS>
His
looks
were
much
the
same
as
ever
,
but
his
mind
was
singularly
altered
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
this
or
that
passion
stood
out
in
brighter
or
in
dimmer
hues
;
but
that
the
colour
of
the
whole
man
was
faded
.
<EOS>
As
one
trait
disappeared
,
no
other
trait
sprung
up
to
take
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
His
senses
dwindled
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
less
keen
of
sight
;
was
deaf
sometimes
;
took
little
notice
of
what
passed
before
him
;
and
would
be
profoundly
taciturn
for
days
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
process
of
this
alteration
was
so
easy
that
almost
as
soon
as
it
began
to
be
observed
it
was
complete
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pecksniff
saw
it
first
,
and
having
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
fresh
in
his
recollection
,
saw
in
his
brother
Martin
the
same
process
of
decay
.
   
<EOS>
To
a
gentleman
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
tenderness
,
this
was
a
very
mournful
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
foresee
the
probability
of
his
respected
relative
being
made
the
victim
of
designing
persons
,
and
of
his
riches
falling
into
worthless
hands
.
 
<EOS>
It
gave
him
so
much
pain
that
he
resolved
to
secure
the
property
to
himself
;
to
keep
bad
testamentary
suitors
at
a
distance
;
to
wall
up
the
old
gentleman
,
as
it
were
,
for
his
own
use
.
 
<EOS>
By
little
and
little
,
therefore
,
he
began
to
try
whether
Mr
Chuzzlewit
gave
any
promise
of
becoming
an
instrument
in
his
hands
,
and
finding
that
he
did
,
and
indeed
that
he
was
very
supple
in
his
plastic
fingers
,
he
made
it
the
business
of
his
life
---
kind
soul
!
---
to
establish
an
ascendancy
over
him
;
and
every
little
test
he
durst
apply
meeting
with
a
success
beyond
his
hopes
<EOS>
,
he
began
to
think
he
heard
old
Martin
's
cash
already
chinking
in
his
own
unworldly
pockets
.
   
<EOS>
But
when
Mr
Pecksniff
pondered
on
this
subject
(
as
,
in
his
zealous
way
,
he
often
did
)
,
and
thought
with
an
uplifted
heart
of
the
train
of
circumstances
which
had
delivered
the
old
gentleman
into
his
hands
for
the
confusion
of
evil
-
doers
and
the
triumph
of
a
righteous
nature
<EOS>
,
he
always
felt
that
Mary
Graham
was
his
stumbling
-
block
.
<EOS>
Let
the
old
man
say
what
he
would
,
Mr
Pecksniff
knew
he
had
a
strong
affection
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
showed
it
in
a
thousand
little
ways
;
that
he
liked
to
have
her
near
him
,
and
was
never
quite
at
ease
when
she
was
absent
long
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
ever
really
sworn
to
leave
her
nothing
in
his
will
,
Mr
Pecksniff
greatly
doubted
.
 
<EOS>
That
even
if
he
had
,
there
were
many
ways
by
which
he
could
evade
the
oath
and
satisfy
his
conscience
,
Mr
Pecksniff
knew
.
 
<EOS>
That
her
unprotected
state
was
no
light
burden
on
the
old
man
's
mind
<EOS>
,
he
also
knew
,
for
Mr
Chuzzlewit
had
plainly
told
him
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
"
<EOS>
what
if
I
married
her
!
 
<EOS>
What
,
"
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
,
sticking
up
his
hair
and
glancing
at
his
bust
by
Spoker
;
"
what
<EOS>
if
,
making
sure
of
his
approval
first
---
he
is
nearly
imbecile
,
poor
gentleman
---
I
married
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
a
lively
sense
of
the
Beautiful
;
especially
in
women
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
towards
the
sex
was
remarkable
for
its
insinuating
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
recorded
of
him
in
another
part
of
these
pages
,
that
he
embraced
Mrs
Todgers
on
the
smallest
provocation
;
and
it
was
a
way
he
had
;
it
was
a
part
of
the
gentle
placidity
of
his
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
Before
any
thought
of
matrimony
was
in
his
mind
,
he
had
bestowed
on
Mary
many
little
tokens
of
his
spiritual
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
indignantly
received
,
but
that
was
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
as
the
idea
expanded
within
him
,
these
had
become
too
ardent
to
escape
the
piercing
eye
of
Cherry
,
who
read
his
scheme
at
once
;
but
he
had
always
felt
the
power
of
Mary
's
charms
.
<EOS>
So
Interest
and
Inclination
made
a
pair
,
and
drew
the
curricle
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
plan
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
any
thought
of
revenging
himself
on
young
Martin
for
his
insolent
expressions
when
they
parted
,
and
of
shutting
him
out
still
more
effectually
from
any
hope
of
reconciliation
with
his
grandfather
,
Mr
Pecksniff
was
much
too
meek
and
forgiving
to
be
suspected
of
harbouring
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
being
refused
by
Mary
,
Mr
Pecksniff
was
quite
satisfied
that
in
her
position
she
could
never
hold
out
if
he
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
were
both
against
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
consulting
the
wishes
of
her
heart
in
such
a
case
,
it
formed
no
part
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
moral
code
;
for
he
knew
what
a
good
man
he
was
,
and
what
a
blessing
he
must
be
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
His
daughter
having
broken
the
ice
,
and
the
murder
being
out
between
them
,
Mr
Pecksniff
had
now
only
to
pursue
his
design
as
cleverly
as
he
could
,
and
by
the
craftiest
approaches
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
good
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
meeting
old
Martin
in
the
garden
,
for
it
was
his
habit
to
walk
in
and
out
by
that
way
,
as
the
fancy
took
him
;
"
and
<EOS>
how
is
my
dear
friend
this
delicious
morning
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
me
?
"
asked
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
one
of
his
deaf
days
,
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
mean
any
one
else
,
my
dear
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
meant
Mary
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
might
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
speak
of
her
as
a
dear
,
dear
friend
,
I
hope
?
"
observed
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
returned
old
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
deserves
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Think
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pecksniff
,
"
think
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
speaking
,
I
know
,
"
returned
Martin
,
"
but
I
do
n't
catch
what
you
say
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
up
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
getting
deafer
than
a
flint
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
saying
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
I
am
afraid
I
must
make
up
my
mind
to
part
with
Cherry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
has
SHE
been
doing
?
"
asked
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
puts
the
most
ridiculous
questions
I
ever
heard
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
child
to
-
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
which
he
added
,
in
a
mild
roar
:
"
She
has
n't
been
doing
anything
,
my
dear
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
going
to
part
with
her
for
?
"
demanded
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
has
n't
her
health
by
any
means
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
misses
her
sister
,
my
dear
sir
;
they
doted
on
each
other
from
the
cradle
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
of
giving
her
a
run
in
London
for
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
A
good
long
run
,
sir
,
if
I
find
she
likes
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
"
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
judicious
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
mean
to
bear
me
company
in
this
dull
part
,
while
she
's
away
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
intention
of
removing
from
it
,
"
was
Martin
's
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
taking
the
old
man
's
arm
in
his
,
and
walking
slowly
on
;
"
Why
,
my
good
sir
,
ca
n't
you
come
and
stay
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
could
surround
you
with
more
comforts
---
<EOS>
lowly
as
is
my
Cot
---
than
you
can
obtain
at
a
village
house
of
entertainment
.
<EOS>
And
pardon
me
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
pardon
me
if
I
say
that
such
a
place
as
the
Dragon
,
however
well
-
conducted
(
and
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
Mrs
Lupin
is
one
of
the
worthiest
creatures
in
this
county
)
,
is
hardly
a
home
for
Miss
Graham
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
mused
a
moment
;
and
then
said
,
as
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
quite
right
;
it
is
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
sight
of
skittles
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
eloquently
pursued
,
"
is
far
from
being
congenial
to
a
delicate
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
amusement
of
the
vulgar
,
"
said
old
Martin
,
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
the
very
vulgar
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
why
not
bring
Miss
Graham
here
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Here
is
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Here
am
I
alone
in
it
,
for
Thomas
Pinch
<EOS>
I
do
not
count
as
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Our
lovely
friend
shall
occupy
my
daughter
's
chamber
;
you
shall
choose
your
own
;
we
shall
not
quarrel
,
I
hope
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
likely
to
do
that
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
pressed
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
understand
each
other
,
my
dear
sir
,
I
see
!
<EOS>
---
I
can
wind
him
,
"
he
thought
,
with
exultation
,
"
round
my
little
finger
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
leave
the
recompense
to
me
?
"
said
the
old
man
,
after
a
minute
's
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
do
not
speak
of
recompense
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
repeated
Martin
,
with
a
glimmer
of
his
old
obstinacy
,
"
you
leave
the
recompense
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Since
you
desire
it
,
my
good
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
always
desire
it
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
always
desire
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
pay
as
I
go
,
even
when
I
buy
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
do
not
leave
a
balance
to
be
settled
one
day
,
Pecksniff
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
architect
was
too
much
overcome
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
drop
a
tear
upon
his
patron
's
hand
,
but
could
n't
find
one
in
his
dry
distillery
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
that
day
be
very
distant
!
<EOS>
"
was
his
pious
exclamation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
say
how
deep
an
interest
I
have
in
you
and
yours
!
<EOS>
I
allude
to
our
beautiful
young
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
True
.
 
<EOS>
She
need
have
some
one
interested
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
her
wrong
to
train
her
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Orphan
though
she
was
,
she
would
have
found
some
one
to
protect
her
whom
she
might
have
loved
again
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
was
a
child
,
I
pleased
myself
with
the
thought
that
in
gratifying
my
whim
of
placing
her
between
me
and
false
-
hearted
knaves
,
I
had
done
her
a
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
Now
she
is
a
woman
,
I
have
no
such
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
no
protector
but
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
her
at
such
odds
with
the
world
,
that
any
dog
may
bark
or
fawn
upon
her
at
his
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
she
stands
in
need
of
delicate
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
;
indeed
she
does
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
her
position
could
be
altered
and
defined
,
sir
?
"
Mr
Pecksniff
hinted
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
that
be
done
?
 
<EOS>
Should
I
make
a
seamstress
of
her
,
or
a
governess
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forbid
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
there
are
other
ways
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
much
excited
and
embarrassed
at
present
,
and
would
rather
not
pursue
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
resume
it
at
another
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
unwell
?
"
asked
Martin
anxiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
"
cried
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
Permit
me
to
resume
it
at
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
walk
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
blessed
him
in
return
,
and
squeezed
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
turned
away
,
and
slowly
walked
towards
the
house
,
Mr
Pecksniff
stood
gazing
after
him
;
being
pretty
well
recovered
from
his
late
emotion
,
which
,
in
any
other
man
,
one
might
have
thought
had
been
assumed
as
a
machinery
for
feeling
Martin
's
pulse
.
 
<EOS>
The
change
in
the
old
man
found
such
a
slight
expression
in
his
figure
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
after
him
,
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
:
   
<EOS>
"
And
I
can
wind
him
round
my
little
finger
!
 
<EOS>
Only
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
happening
to
turn
his
head
,
saluted
him
affectionately
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
returned
the
gesture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
time
was
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
;
"
and
not
long
ago
,
when
he
would
n't
look
at
me
!
 
<EOS>
How
soothing
is
this
change
.
 
<EOS>
Such
is
the
delicate
texture
of
the
human
heart
;
so
complicated
is
the
process
of
its
being
softened
!
 
<EOS>
Externally
he
looks
the
same
,
and
I
can
wind
him
round
my
little
finger
.
 
<EOS>
Only
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
sober
truth
,
there
did
appear
to
be
nothing
on
which
Mr
Pecksniff
might
not
have
ventured
with
Martin
Chuzzlewit
;
for
whatever
Mr
Pecksniff
said
or
did
was
right
,
and
whatever
he
advised
was
done
.
<EOS>
Martin
had
escaped
so
many
snares
from
needy
fortune
-
hunters
,
and
had
withered
in
the
shell
of
his
suspicion
and
distrust
for
so
many
years
,
but
to
become
the
good
man
's
tool
and
plaything
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
happiness
of
this
conviction
painted
on
his
face
,
the
architect
went
forth
upon
his
morning
walk
.
   
<EOS>
The
summer
weather
in
his
bosom
was
reflected
in
the
breast
of
Nature
.
 
<EOS>
Through
deep
green
vistas
where
the
boughs
arched
overhead
,
and
showed
the
sunlight
flashing
in
the
beautiful
perspective
;
through
dewy
fern
from
which
the
startled
hares
leaped
up
,
and
fled
at
his
approach
;
by
mantled
pools
,
and
fallen
trees
,
and
down
in
hollow
places
,
rustling
among
last
year
's
leaves
whose
scent
woke
memory
of
the
past
;
the
placid
Pecksniff
strolled
.
 
<EOS>
By
meadow
gates
and
hedges
fragrant
with
wild
roses
;
and
by
thatched
-
roof
cottages
whose
inmates
humbly
bowed
before
him
as
a
man
both
good
and
wise
;
the
worthy
Pecksniff
walked
in
tranquil
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
The
bee
passed
onward
,
humming
of
the
work
he
had
to
do
;
the
idle
gnats
for
ever
going
round
and
round
in
one
contracting
and
expanding
ring
,
yet
always
going
on
as
fast
as
he
,
danced
merrily
before
him
;
the
colour
of
the
long
grass
came
and
went
,
as
if
the
light
clouds
made
it
timid
as
they
floated
through
the
distant
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
birds
,
so
many
Pecksniff
consciences
,
sang
gaily
upon
every
branch
;
and
Mr
Pecksniff
paid
HIS
homage
to
the
day
by
ruminating
on
his
projects
as
he
walked
along
.
   
<EOS>
Chancing
to
trip
,
in
his
abstraction
,
over
the
spreading
root
of
an
old
tree
,
he
raised
his
pious
eyes
to
take
a
survey
of
the
ground
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
startled
him
to
see
the
embodied
image
of
his
thoughts
not
far
ahead
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
herself
.
 
<EOS>
And
alone
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
Mr
Pecksniff
stopped
as
if
with
the
intention
of
avoiding
her
;
but
his
next
impulse
was
to
advance
,
which
he
did
at
a
brisk
pace
;
caroling
as
he
went
so
sweetly
and
with
so
much
innocence
that
he
only
wanted
feathers
and
wings
to
be
a
bird
.
   
<EOS>
Hearing
notes
behind
her
,
not
belonging
to
the
songsters
of
the
grove
,
she
looked
round
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
kissed
his
hand
,
and
was
at
her
side
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
"
Communing
with
nature
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
am
I.
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
the
morning
was
so
beautiful
that
she
had
walked
further
than
she
intended
,
and
would
return
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
said
it
was
exactly
his
case
,
and
he
would
return
with
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
my
arm
,
sweet
girl
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
Mary
declined
it
,
and
walked
so
very
fast
that
he
remonstrated
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
loitering
when
I
came
upon
you
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
be
so
cruel
as
to
hurry
now
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
shun
me
,
would
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
would
,
"
she
answered
,
turning
her
glowing
cheek
indignantly
upon
him
,
"
you
know
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
Release
me
,
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Your
touch
is
disagreeable
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
touch
!
 
<EOS>
What
?
 
<EOS>
That
chaste
patriarchal
touch
which
Mrs
Todgers
---
 
surely
a
discreet
lady
---
had
endured
,
not
only
without
complaint
,
but
with
apparent
satisfaction
!
 
<EOS>
This
was
positively
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
sorry
to
hear
her
say
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
not
observed
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
that
it
is
so
<EOS>
,
pray
take
assurance
from
my
lips
,
and
do
not
,
as
you
are
a
gentleman
,
continue
to
offend
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
mildly
,
"
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
might
consider
this
becoming
in
a
daughter
of
my
own
,
and
why
should
I
object
to
it
in
one
so
beautiful
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
harsh
.
 
<EOS>
It
cuts
me
to
the
soul
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
quarrel
with
you
,
Mary
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
tried
to
say
she
was
sorry
to
hear
it
,
but
burst
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
now
repeated
the
Todgers
performance
on
a
comfortable
scale
,
as
if
he
intended
it
to
last
some
time
;
and
in
his
disengaged
hand
,
catching
hers
,
employed
himself
in
separating
the
fingers
with
his
own
,
and
sometimes
kissing
them
,
as
he
pursued
the
conversation
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
we
met
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
we
met
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
able
now
to
ease
my
bosom
of
a
heavy
load
,
and
speak
to
you
in
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
in
his
tenderest
tones
,
indeed
they
were
so
very
tender
that
he
almost
squeaked
:
"
<EOS>
My
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
fantastic
thing
,
that
maiden
affectation
!
 
<EOS>
She
made
believe
to
shudder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
love
you
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
my
gentle
life
,
with
a
devotion
which
is
quite
surprising
,
even
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
suppose
that
the
sensation
was
buried
in
the
silent
tomb
of
a
lady
,
only
second
to
you
in
qualities
of
the
mind
and
form
;
but
I
find
I
am
mistaken
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
tried
to
disengage
her
hand
,
but
might
as
well
have
tried
to
free
herself
from
the
embrace
of
an
affectionate
boa
-
constrictor
;
if
anything
so
wily
may
be
brought
into
comparison
with
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Although
I
am
a
widower
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
examining
the
rings
upon
her
fingers
,
and
tracing
the
course
of
one
delicate
blue
vein
with
his
fat
thumb
,
"
a
widower
with
two
daughters
<EOS>
,
still
I
am
not
encumbered
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
as
you
know
,
is
married
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
,
by
her
own
desire
,
but
with
a
view
,
I
will
confess
---
<EOS>
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
---
to
my
altering
my
condition
,
is
about
to
leave
her
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
character
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
People
are
pleased
to
speak
well
of
me
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
My
person
and
manner
are
not
absolutely
those
of
a
monster
,
I
trust
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
naughty
Hand
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
apostrophizing
the
reluctant
prize
,
"
why
did
you
take
me
prisoner
?
<EOS>
Go
,
go
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
slapped
the
hand
to
punish
it
;
but
relenting
,
folded
it
in
his
waistcoat
to
comfort
it
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Blessed
in
each
other
,
and
in
the
society
of
our
venerable
friend
,
my
darling
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
we
shall
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
is
wafted
to
a
haven
of
rest
,
we
will
console
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
My
pretty
primrose
,
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
possible
,
"
Mary
answered
,
in
a
hurried
manner
,
"
that
I
ought
to
feel
grateful
for
this
mark
of
your
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
do
,
but
I
am
willing
to
suppose
you
may
deserve
my
thanks
.
<EOS>
Take
them
;
and
pray
leave
me
,
Mr
Pecksniff
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
good
man
smiled
a
greasy
smile
;
and
drew
her
closer
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
pray
release
me
,
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
listen
to
your
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
receive
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
many
to
whom
it
may
be
acceptable
,
but
it
is
not
so
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
an
act
of
kindness
and
an
act
of
pity
,
leave
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
walked
on
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
and
her
hand
in
his
,
as
contentedly
as
if
they
had
been
all
in
all
to
each
other
,
and
were
joined
in
the
bonds
of
truest
love
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
force
me
by
your
superior
strength
,
"
said
Mary
,
who
finding
that
good
words
had
not
the
least
effect
upon
him
,
made
no
further
effort
to
suppress
her
indignation
;
"
if
you
force
me
by
your
superior
strength
to
accompany
you
back
,
and
to
be
the
subject
of
your
insolence
upon
the
way
,
you
can
not
constrain
the
expression
of
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
you
in
the
deepest
abhorrence
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
your
real
nature
and
despise
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
sweetly
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
what
arts
or
unhappy
chances
you
have
gained
your
influence
over
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
I
do
not
know
,
"
said
Mary
;
"
it
may
be
strong
enough
to
soften
even
this
,
but
he
shall
know
of
this
,
trust
me
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
raised
his
heavy
eyelids
languidly
,
and
let
them
fall
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
saying
with
perfect
coolness
,
"
Aye
,
aye
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
Is
it
not
enough
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
that
you
warp
and
change
his
nature
,
adapt
his
every
prejudice
to
your
bad
ends
,
and
harden
a
heart
naturally
kind
by
shutting
out
the
truth
and
allowing
none
but
false
and
distorted
views
to
reach
it
<EOS>
;
is
it
not
enough
that
you
have
the
power
of
doing
this
,
and
that
you
exercise
it
,
but
must
you
also
be
so
coarse
,
so
cruel
,
and
so
cowardly
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Still
Mr
Pecksniff
led
her
calmly
on
,
and
looked
as
mild
as
any
lamb
that
ever
pastured
in
the
fields
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
nothing
move
you
,
sir
?
"
cried
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
observed
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
placid
leer
,
"
a
habit
of
self
-
examination
,
and
the
practice
of
---
<EOS>
shall
I
say
of
virtue
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
hypocrisy
,
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
resumed
Mr
Pecksniff
,
chafing
the
captive
hand
reproachfully
,
"
of
virtue
---
have
enabled
me
to
set
such
guards
upon
myself
,
that
it
is
really
difficult
to
ruffle
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
curious
fact
,
but
it
is
difficult
,
do
you
know
,
for
any
one
to
ruffle
me
.
<EOS>
And
did
she
think
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
playful
tightening
of
his
grasp
"
that
SHE
could
!
 
<EOS>
How
little
did
she
know
his
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
Little
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
so
strangely
constituted
that
she
would
have
preferred
the
caresses
of
a
toad
,
an
adder
,
or
a
serpent
---
nay
,
the
hug
of
a
bear
---
to
the
endearments
of
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
that
good
gentleman
,
"
a
word
or
two
will
set
this
matter
right
,
and
establish
a
pleasant
understanding
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
angry
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
angry
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
I
am
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
are
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
beating
heart
beneath
his
hand
that
told
another
story
though
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
are
not
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
:
"
and
I
will
tell
you
why
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
two
Martin
Chuzzlewits
,
my
dear
;
and
<EOS>
your
carrying
your
anger
to
one
might
have
a
serious
effect
---
who
knows
!
<EOS>
---
upon
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
wish
to
hurt
him
,
would
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
trembled
violently
,
and
looked
at
him
with
such
a
proud
disdain
that
he
turned
his
eyes
away
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
lest
he
should
be
offended
with
her
in
spite
of
his
better
self
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
passive
quarrel
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
may
be
changed
into
an
active
one
,
remember
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
sad
to
blight
even
a
disinherited
young
man
in
his
already
blighted
prospects
;
but
how
easy
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
how
easy
!
 
<EOS>
HAVE
I
influence
with
our
venerable
friend
,
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
perhaps
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
;
and
nodded
with
an
air
of
banter
that
was
charming
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
continued
,
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
the
whole
,
my
sweet
,
if
I
were
you
I
'd
keep
my
secret
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
sure
---
very
far
from
it
---
that
it
would
surprise
our
friend
in
any
way
,
for
he
and
I
have
had
some
conversation
together
only
this
morning
,
and
he
is
anxious
,
very
anxious
,
to
establish
you
in
some
more
settled
manner
.
 
<EOS>
But
whether
he
was
surprised
or
not
surprised
,
the
consequence
of
your
imparting
it
might
be
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
junior
might
suffer
severely
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
have
compassion
on
Martin
junior
,
<EOS>
do
you
know
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
persuasive
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
n't
deserve
it
,
but
I
would
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
wept
so
bitterly
now
,
and
was
so
much
distressed
,
that
he
thought
it
prudent
to
unclasp
her
waist
,
and
hold
her
only
by
the
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
our
own
share
in
the
precious
little
mystery
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
we
will
keep
it
to
ourselves
,
and
talk
of
it
between
ourselves
,
and
you
shall
think
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
consent
,
my
love
;
you
will
consent
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
you
may
think
;
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
remember
to
have
heard
---
I
really
do
n't
know
where
,
or
how
"
---
he
added
,
with
bewitching
frankness
,
"
that
you
and
Martin
junior
,
when
you
were
children
,
had
a
sort
of
childish
fondness
for
each
other
.
<EOS>
When
we
are
married
,
you
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
it
did
n't
last
to
ruin
him
,
but
passed
away
to
do
him
good
;
for
we
'll
see
then
what
we
can
do
to
put
some
trifling
help
in
Martin
junior
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
HAVE
I
any
influence
with
our
venerable
friend
?
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
have

"
   
<EOS>
The
outlet
from
the
wood
in
which
these
tender
passages
occurred
,
was
close
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
now
so
near
it
that
he
stopped
,
and
holding
up
her
little
finger
,
said
in
playful
accents
,
as
a
parting
fancy
:
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
bite
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Receiving
no
reply
he
kissed
it
instead
;
and
then
stooping
down
,
inclined
his
flabby
face
to
hers
---
he
had
a
flabby
face
,
although
he
WAS
a
good
man
---
and
with
a
blessing
,
which
from
such
a
source
was
quite
enough
to
set
her
up
in
life
,
and
prosper
her
from
that
time
forth
permitted
her
to
leave
him
.
   
<EOS>
Gallantry
in
its
true
sense
is
supposed
to
ennoble
and
dignify
a
man
;
and
love
has
shed
refinements
on
innumerable
Cymons
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pecksniff
---
perhaps
because
to
one
of
his
exalted
nature
these
were
mere
grossnesses
---
certainly
did
not
appear
to
any
unusual
advantage
,
now
that
he
was
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
seemed
to
be
shrunk
and
reduced
;
to
be
trying
to
hide
himself
within
himself
;
and
to
be
wretched
at
not
having
the
power
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
shoes
looked
too
large
;
his
sleeve
looked
too
long
;
his
hair
looked
too
limp
;
his
features
looked
too
mean
;
his
exposed
throat
looked
as
if
a
halter
would
have
done
it
good
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
two
,
in
fact
,
he
was
hot
,
and
pale
,
and
mean
,
and
shy
,
and
slinking
,
and
<EOS>
consequently
not
at
all
Pecksniffian
.
 
<EOS>
But
after
that
,
he
recovered
himself
,
and
went
home
with
as
beneficent
an
air
as
if
he
had
been
the
High
Priest
of
the
summer
weather
.

"
I
have
arranged

Papa

said
Charity

"
to

morrow

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
soon
,
my
child

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
go
too
soon
,
"
said
Charity
,
"
under
the
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
written
to
Mrs
Todgers
to
propose
an
arrangement
,
and
have
requested
her
to
meet
me
at
the
coach
,
at
all
events
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
quite
your
own
master
now
,
Mr
Pinch
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
just
gone
out
of
the
room
,
and
Tom
had
just
come
into
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
own
master
!
"
repeated
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
'll
have
nobody
to
interfere
with
you
,
"
said
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
I
hope
you
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
changing
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
are
YOU
going
to
be
married
,
Miss
Pecksniff
?
"
asked
Tom
in
great
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
"
faltered
Cherry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
made
up
my
mind
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
could
be
,
if
I
chose
,
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
could
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
it
in
perfect
good
faith
.
 
<EOS>
He
believed
it
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Cherry
,
"
I
am
not
going
to
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
is
,
that
I
know
of
.
 
<EOS>
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
going
to
live
with
Papa
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
reasons
,
but
it
's
all
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
always
feel
very
kindly
towards
you
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
for
the
boldness
you
showed
that
night
.
<EOS>
As
to
you
and
me
,
Mr
Pinch
,
WE
part
the
best
friends
possible
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
thanked
her
for
her
confidence
,
and
for
her
friendship
,
but
there
was
a
mystery
in
the
former
which
perfectly
bewildered
him
.
<EOS>
In
his
extravagant
devotion
to
the
family
,
he
had
felt
the
loss
of
Merry
more
than
any
one
but
those
who
knew
that
for
all
the
slights
he
underwent
he
thought
his
own
demerits
were
to
blame
,
could
possibly
have
understood
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
reconciled
himself
to
that
when
here
was
Charity
about
to
leave
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
grown
up
,
as
it
were
,
under
Tom
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
The
sisters
were
a
part
of
Pecksniff
,
and
a
part
of
Tom
;
items
in
Pecksniff
's
goodness
,
and
in
Tom
's
service
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
bear
it
;
<EOS>
not
two
hours
'
sleep
had
Tom
that
night
,
through
dwelling
in
his
bed
upon
these
dreadful
changes
.
   
<EOS>
When
morning
dawned
he
thought
he
must
have
dreamed
this
piece
of
ambiguity
;
but
no
,
on
going
downstairs
he
found
them
packing
trunks
and
cording
boxes
,
and
making
other
preparations
for
Miss
Charity
's
departure
,
which
lasted
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
In
good
time
for
the
evening
coach
,
Miss
Charity
deposited
her
housekeeping
keys
with
much
ceremony
upon
the
parlour
table
;
took
a
gracious
leave
of
all
the
house
;
and
quitted
her
paternal
roof
---
a
blessing
for
which
the
Pecksniffian
servant
was
observed
by
some
profane
persons
to
be
particularly
active
in
the
thanksgiving
at
church
next
Sunday
.

<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
is
discharged
of
a
duty
which
he
never
owed
to
anybody
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
discharges
a
duty
which
he
owes
to
society
 
<EOS>
The
closing
words
of
the
last
chapter
lead
naturally
to
the
commencement
of
this
,
its
successor
;
for
it
has
to
do
with
a
church
.
<EOS>
With
the
church
,
so
often
mentioned
heretofore
,
in
which
Tom
Pinch
played
the
organ
for
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
One
sultry
afternoon
,
about
a
week
after
Miss
Charity
's
departure
for
London
,
Mr
Pecksniff
being
out
walking
by
himself
,
took
it
into
his
head
to
stray
into
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
lingering
among
the
tombstones
,
endeavouring
to
extract
an
available
sentiment
or
two
from
the
epitaphs
---
for
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
making
up
a
few
moral
crackers
,
to
be
let
off
as
occasion
served
---
Tom
Pinch
began
to
practice
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
could
run
down
to
the
church
and
do
so
whenever
he
had
time
to
spare
;
for
it
was
a
simple
little
organ
,
provided
with
wind
by
the
action
of
the
musician
's
feet
;
and
he
was
independent
,
even
of
a
bellows
-
blower
.
 
<EOS>
Though
if
Tom
had
wanted
one
at
any
time
,
there
was
not
a
man
or
boy
in
all
the
village
,
and
away
to
the
turnpike
(
tollman
included
)
,
but
would
have
blown
away
for
him
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
no
objection
to
music
;
not
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
tolerant
of
everything
;
he
often
said
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
considered
it
a
vagabond
kind
of
trifling
,
in
general
,
just
suited
to
Tom
's
capacity
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
regard
to
Tom
's
performance
upon
this
same
organ
,
he
was
remarkably
lenient
,
singularly
amiable
;
for
when
Tom
played
it
on
Sundays
,
Mr
Pecksniff
in
his
unbounded
sympathy
felt
as
if
he
played
it
himself
,
and
were
a
benefactor
to
the
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
So
whenever
it
was
impossible
to
devise
any
other
means
of
taking
the
value
of
Tom
's
wages
out
of
him
,
Mr
Pecksniff
gave
him
leave
to
cultivate
this
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
mark
of
his
consideration
<EOS>
Tom
was
very
grateful
.
   
<EOS>
The
afternoon
was
remarkably
warm
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
had
been
strolling
a
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
what
may
be
called
a
fine
ear
for
music
,
but
he
knew
when
it
had
a
tranquilizing
influence
on
his
soul
;
and
that
was
the
case
now
,
for
it
sounded
to
him
like
a
melodious
snore
.
 
<EOS>
He
approached
the
church
,
and
looking
through
the
diamond
lattice
of
a
window
near
the
porch
,
saw
Tom
,
with
the
curtains
in
the
loft
drawn
back
,
playing
away
with
great
expression
and
tenderness
.
   
<EOS>
The
church
had
an
inviting
air
of
coolness
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
oak
roof
supported
by
cross
-
beams
,
the
hoary
walls
,
the
marble
tablets
,
and
the
cracked
stone
pavement
,
were
refreshing
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
leaves
of
ivy
tapping
gently
at
the
opposite
windows
;
and
the
sun
poured
in
through
only
one
;
leaving
the
body
of
the
church
in
tempting
shade
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
most
tempting
spot
of
all
,
was
one
red
-
curtained
and
soft
-
cushioned
pew
,
wherein
the
official
dignitaries
of
the
place
(
of
whom
Mr
Pecksniff
was
the
head
and
chief
)
<EOS>
enshrined
themselves
on
Sundays
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
's
seat
was
in
the
corner
;
a
remarkably
comfortable
corner
;
where
his
very
large
Prayer
-
Book
was
at
that
minute
making
the
most
of
its
quarto
self
upon
the
desk
.
 
<EOS>
He
determined
to
go
in
and
rest
.
   
<EOS>
He
entered
very
softly
;
in
part
because
it
was
a
church
;
in
part
because
his
tread
was
always
soft
;
in
part
because
Tom
played
a
solemn
tune
;
in
part
because
he
thought
he
would
surprise
him
when
he
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
Unbolting
the
door
of
the
high
pew
of
state
,
he
glided
in
and
shut
it
after
him
;
then
sitting
in
his
usual
place
,
and
stretching
out
his
legs
upon
the
hassocks
,
he
composed
himself
to
listen
to
the
music
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
an
unaccountable
circumstance
that
he
should
have
felt
drowsy
there
,
where
the
force
of
association
might
surely
have
been
enough
to
keep
him
wide
awake
;
but
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
in
the
snug
little
corner
five
minutes
before
he
began
to
nod
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
recovered
himself
one
minute
before
he
began
to
nod
again
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
very
act
of
opening
his
eyes
indolently
,
he
nodded
again
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
very
act
of
shutting
them
,
he
nodded
again
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
fell
out
of
one
nod
into
another
until
<EOS>
at
last
he
ceased
to
nod
at
all
,
and
was
as
fast
as
the
church
itself
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
a
consciousness
of
the
organ
,
long
after
he
fell
asleep
,
though
as
to
its
being
an
organ
he
had
no
more
idea
of
that
than
he
had
of
its
being
a
bull
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
he
began
to
have
at
intervals
the
same
dreamy
impressions
of
voices
;
and
awakening
to
an
indolent
curiosity
upon
the
subject
,
opened
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
so
indolent
,
that
after
glancing
at
the
hassocks
and
the
pew
,
he
was
already
half
-
way
off
to
sleep
again
,
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
really
were
voices
in
the
church
;
low
voices
,
talking
earnestly
hard
by
;
while
the
echoes
seemed
to
mutter
responses
.
 
<EOS>
He
roused
himself
,
and
listened
.
   
<EOS>
Before
he
had
listened
half
a
dozen
seconds
,
he
became
as
broad
awake
as
ever
he
had
been
in
all
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
With
eyes
,
and
ears
,
and
mouth
,
wide
open
,
he
moved
himself
a
very
little
with
the
utmost
caution
,
and
gathering
the
curtain
in
his
hand
,
peeped
out
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
and
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
recognized
their
voices
,
and
already
knew
the
topic
they
discussed
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
like
the
small
end
of
a
guillotined
man
,
with
his
chin
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
pew
,
so
that
he
might
duck
down
immediately
in
case
of
either
of
them
turning
round
,
he
listened
.
 
<EOS>
Listened
with
such
concentrated
eagerness
,
that
his
very
hair
and
shirt
-
collar
stood
bristling
up
to
help
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
letters
have
ever
reached
me
,
except
that
one
from
New
York
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
be
uneasy
on
that
account
,
<EOS>
for
it
's
very
likely
they
have
gone
away
to
some
far
-
off
place
,
where
the
posts
are
neither
regular
nor
frequent
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
in
that
very
letter
that
it
might
be
so
,
even
in
that
city
to
which
they
thought
of
travelling
---
<EOS>
Eden
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
great
weight
upon
my
mind
,
"
said
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
you
must
n't
let
it
be
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
true
saying
that
nothing
travels
so
fast
as
ill
news
;
and
if
the
slightest
harm
had
happened
to
Martin
,
you
may
be
sure
you
would
have
heard
of
it
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
wished
to
say
this
to
you
,
<EOS>
"
Tom
continued
with
an
embarrassment
that
became
him
very
well
,
"
but
you
have
never
given
me
an
opportunity
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
sometimes
been
almost
afraid
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
that
you
might
suppose
I
hesitated
to
confide
in
you
,
Mr
Pinch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
Tom
stammered
,
"
I
<EOS>
---
I
am
not
aware
that
I
ever
supposed
that
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
that
if
I
have
,
I
have
checked
the
thought
directly
,
as
an
injustice
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
the
delicacy
of
your
situation
in
having
to
confide
in
me
at
all
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
but
I
would
risk
my
life
to
save
you
from
one
day
's
uneasiness
;
indeed
I
would
!
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Tom
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
dreaded
sometimes
,
"
Tom
continued
,
"
that
I
might
have
displeased
you
by
---
by
having
the
boldness
to
try
and
anticipate
your
wishes
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
At
other
times
I
have
fancied
that
your
kindness
prompted
you
to
keep
aloof
from
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
foolish
;
very
presumptuous
and
ridiculous
,
to
think
so
,
"
Tom
pursued
;
"
but
I
feared
you
might
suppose
it
possible
that
I
---
I
---
should
admire
you
too
much
for
my
own
peace
;
and
so
denied
yourself
the
slight
assistance
you
would
otherwise
have
accepted
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
such
an
idea
has
ever
presented
itself
to
you
,
"
faltered
Tom
,
"
pray
dismiss
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
easily
made
happy
;
and
I
shall
live
contented
here
long
after
you
and
Martin
have
forgotten
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
poor
,
shy
,
awkward
creature
;
not
at
all
a
man
of
the
world
;
and
you
should
think
no
more
of
me
,
bless
you
,
than
if
I
were
an
old
friar
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
If
friars
bear
such
hearts
as
thine
,
Tom
,
let
friars
multiply
;
though
they
have
no
such
rule
in
all
their
stern
arithmetic
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mr
Pinch
!
"
said
Mary
,
giving
him
her
hand
;
"
I
can
not
tell
you
how
your
kindness
moves
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
wronged
you
by
the
lightest
doubt
,
and
have
never
for
an
instant
ceased
to
feel
that
you
were
all
---
much
more
than
all
---
that
Martin
found
you
.
 
<EOS>
Without
the
silent
care
and
friendship
I
have
experienced
from
you
,
my
life
here
would
have
been
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
been
a
good
angel
to
me
;
filling
me
with
gratitude
of
heart
,
hope
,
and
courage
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
little
like
an
angel
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
replied
Tom
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
as
any
stone
cherubim
among
the
grave
-
stones
;
and
I
do
n't
think
there
are
many
real
angels
of
THAT
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
should
like
to
know
(
if
you
will
tell
me
)
why
you
have
been
so
very
silent
about
Martin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
have
been
afraid
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
of
injuring
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
injuring
me
!
"
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
doing
you
an
injury
with
your
employer
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
in
question
dived
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
Pecksniff
!
"
rejoined
Tom
,
with
cheerful
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
he
'd
never
think
of
us
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
the
best
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
at
ease
you
were
,
the
happier
he
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
you
need
n't
be
afraid
of
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
a
spy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Many
a
man
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
place
,
if
he
could
have
dived
through
the
floor
of
the
pew
of
state
and
come
out
at
Calcutta
or
any
inhabited
region
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
,
would
have
done
it
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
sat
down
upon
a
hassock
,
and
listening
more
attentively
than
ever
,
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
Mary
seemed
to
have
expressed
some
dissent
in
the
meanwhile
,
for
Tom
went
on
to
say
,
with
honest
energy
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
but
it
always
happens
,
whenever
I
express
myself
in
this
way
to
anybody
almost
,
that
I
find
they
wo
n't
do
justice
to
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances
that
ever
came
within
my
knowledge
,
but
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
There
's
John
Westlock
,
who
used
to
be
a
pupil
here
,
one
of
the
best
-
hearted
young
men
in
the
world
,
in
all
other
matters
<EOS>
---
I
really
believe
John
would
have
Pecksniff
flogged
at
the
cart
's
tail
if
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
And
John
is
not
a
solitary
case
,
for
every
pupil
we
have
had
in
my
time
has
gone
away
with
the
same
inveterate
hatred
of
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
Mark
Tapley
,
too
,
quite
in
another
station
of
life
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
the
mockery
he
used
to
make
of
Pecksniff
when
he
was
at
the
Dragon
was
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
too
:
<EOS>
Martin
was
worse
than
any
of
'em
.
<EOS>
But
I
forgot
.
 
<EOS>
He
prepared
you
to
dislike
Pecksniff
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
came
with
a
prejudice
,
you
know
,
Miss
Graham
,
and
are
not
a
fair
witness
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
triumphed
very
much
in
this
discovery
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
with
great
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
you
mistake
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
YOU
mistake
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
rapid
change
in
his
tone
,
"
what
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Graham
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
brought
up
to
the
top
of
the
pew
,
by
slow
degrees
,
his
hair
,
his
forehead
,
his
eyebrow
,
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
on
a
bench
beside
the
door
with
her
hands
before
her
face
;
and
Tom
was
bending
over
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
said
anything
to
hurt
you
?
<EOS>
Has
any
one
said
anything
to
hurt
you
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
tell
me
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
Mercy
on
us
,
I
never
was
so
surprised
and
grieved
in
all
my
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
kept
his
eye
in
the
same
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
have
moved
it
now
for
nothing
short
of
a
gimlet
or
a
red
-
hot
wire
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
have
told
you
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
if
I
could
have
helped
it
;
but
your
delusion
is
so
absorbing
,
and
it
is
so
necessary
that
we
should
be
upon
our
guard
;
that
you
should
not
be
compromised
;
and
to
that
end
that
you
should
know
by
whom
I
am
beset
;
that
no
alternative
is
left
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
here
purposely
to
tell
you
,
but
I
think
I
should
have
wanted
courage
if
you
had
not
chanced
to
lead
me
so
directly
to
the
object
of
my
coming
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
gazed
at
her
steadfastly
,
and
seemed
to
say
,
"
What
else
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
said
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
person
whom
you
think
the
best
of
men
,
"
said
Mary
,
looking
up
,
and
speaking
with
a
quivering
lip
and
flashing
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Tom
,
staggering
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
moment
.
<EOS>
That
person
whom
I
think
the
best
of
men
!
 
<EOS>
You
mean
Pecksniff
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
see
you
mean
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Good
gracious
me
,
do
n't
speak
without
authority
.
 
<EOS>
What
has
he
done
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
is
not
the
best
of
men
,
what
is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
worst
.
 
<EOS>
The
falsest
,
craftiest
,
meanest
,
cruellest
,
most
sordid
,
most
shameless
,
"
said
the
trembling
girl
---
trembling
with
her
indignation
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
sat
down
on
a
seat
,
and
clasped
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
is
he
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
who
receiving
me
in
his
house
as
his
guest
;
his
unwilling
guest
;
knowing
my
history
,
and
how
defenceless
and
alone
I
am
,
presumes
before
his
daughters
to
affront
me
so
,
that
if
I
had
a
brother
but
a
child
,
who
saw
it
,
he
would
instinctively
have
helped
me
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
scoundrel
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whoever
he
may
be
,
he
is
a
scoundrel
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
dived
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
is
he
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
who
,
when
my
only
friend
---
a
dear
and
kind
one
,
too
---
was
in
full
health
of
mind
,
humbled
himself
before
him
,
but
was
spurned
away
(
for
he
knew
him
then
)
like
a
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Who
,
in
his
forgiving
spirit
,
now
that
that
friend
is
sunk
into
a
failing
state
,
can
crawl
about
him
again
,
and
use
the
influence
he
basely
gains
for
every
base
and
wicked
purpose
,
and
not
for
one
---
not
one
---
that
's
true
or
good
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
he
is
a
scoundrel
!
"
answered
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
what
is
he
---
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr
Pinch
,
what
IS
he
---
<EOS>
who
,
thinking
he
could
compass
these
designs
the
better
if
I
were
his
wife
,
assails
me
with
the
coward
's
argument
that
if
I
marry
him
,
Martin
,
on
whom
I
have
brought
so
much
misfortune
,
shall
be
restored
to
something
of
his
former
hopes
;
and
if
I
do
not
,
shall
be
plunged
in
deeper
ruin
?
<EOS>
What
is
he
who
makes
my
very
constancy
to
one
I
love
with
all
my
heart
a
torture
to
myself
and
wrong
to
him
;
who
makes
me
,
do
what
I
will
,
the
instrument
to
hurt
a
head
I
would
heap
blessings
on
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
he
who
,
winding
all
these
cruel
snares
about
me
,
explains
their
purpose
to
me
,
with
a
smooth
tongue
and
a
smiling
face
,
in
the
broad
light
of
day
;
dragging
me
on
,
the
while
,
in
his
embrace
,
and
holding
to
his
lips
a
hand
,
"
pursued
the
agitated
girl
,
extending
it
,
"
which
I
would
have
struck
off
,
if
with
it
I
could
lose
the
shame
and
degradation
of
his
touch
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
cried
Tom
,
in
great
excitement
,
"
he
is
a
scoundrel
and
a
villain
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
who
he
is
,
I
say
he
is
a
double
-
dyed
and
most
intolerable
villain
!
"
   
<EOS>
Covering
her
face
with
her
hands
again
,
as
if
the
passion
which
had
sustained
her
through
these
disclosures
lost
itself
in
an
overwhelming
sense
of
shame
and
grief
,
she
abandoned
herself
to
tears
.
   
<EOS>
Any
sight
of
distress
was
sure
to
move
the
tenderness
of
Tom
,
but
this
especially
.
 
<EOS>
Tears
and
sobs
from
her
were
arrows
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
comfort
her
;
sat
down
beside
her
;
expended
all
his
store
of
homely
eloquence
;
and
spoke
in
words
of
praise
and
hope
of
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
though
he
loved
her
from
his
soul
with
such
a
self
-
denying
love
as
woman
seldom
wins
;
he
spoke
from
first
to
last
of
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
Not
the
wealth
of
the
rich
Indies
would
have
tempted
Tom
to
shirk
one
mention
of
her
lover
's
name
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
was
more
composed
,
she
impressed
upon
Tom
that
this
man
she
had
described
,
was
Pecksniff
in
his
real
colours
;
and
word
by
word
and
phrase
by
phrase
,
as
well
as
she
remembered
it
,
related
what
had
passed
between
them
in
the
wood
:
which
was
no
doubt
a
source
of
high
gratification
to
that
gentleman
himself
,
who
in
his
desire
to
see
and
his
dread
of
being
seen
,
was
constantly
diving
down
into
the
state
pew
,
and
coming
up
again
like
the
intelligent
householder
in
Punch
's
Show
,
who
avoids
being
knocked
on
the
head
with
a
cudgel
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
concluded
her
account
,
and
had
besought
Tom
to
be
very
distant
and
unconscious
in
his
manner
towards
her
after
this
explanation
,
and
had
thanked
him
very
much
,
they
parted
on
the
alarm
of
footsteps
in
the
burial
-
ground
;
and
Tom
was
left
alone
in
the
church
again
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
the
full
agitation
and
misery
of
the
disclosure
came
rushing
upon
Tom
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
The
star
of
his
whole
life
from
boyhood
had
become
,
in
a
moment
,
putrid
vapour
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
Pecksniff
,
Tom
's
Pecksniff
,
had
ceased
to
exist
,
but
that
he
never
had
existed
.
<EOS>
In
his
death
Tom
would
have
had
the
comfort
of
remembering
what
he
used
to
be
,
but
in
this
discovery
,
he
had
the
anguish
of
recollecting
what
he
never
was
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
as
Tom
's
blindness
in
this
matter
had
been
total
and
not
partial
,
so
was
his
restored
sight
.
<EOS>
HIS
Pecksniff
could
never
have
worked
the
wickedness
of
which
he
had
just
now
heard
,
but
any
other
Pecksniff
could
;
and
the
Pecksniff
who
could
do
that
could
do
anything
,
and
no
doubt
had
been
doing
anything
and
everything
except
the
right
thing
,
all
through
his
career
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
lofty
height
on
which
poor
Tom
had
placed
his
idol
it
was
tumbled
down
headlong
,
and
     
Not
all
the
king
's
horses
,
nor
all
the
king
's
men
,
     
Could
have
set
Mr
Pecksniff
up
again
.
   
<EOS>
Legions
of
Titans
could
n't
have
got
him
out
of
the
mud
;
and
serve
him
right
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
he
who
suffered
;
it
was
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
His
compass
was
broken
,
his
chart
destroyed
,
his
chronometer
had
stopped
,
his
masts
were
gone
by
the
board
;
his
anchor
was
adrift
,
ten
thousand
leagues
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
watched
him
with
a
lively
interest
,
for
he
divined
the
purpose
of
Tom
's
ruminations
,
and
was
curious
to
see
how
he
conducted
himself
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
time
,
Tom
wandered
up
and
down
the
aisle
like
a
man
demented
,
stopping
occasionally
to
lean
against
a
pew
and
think
it
over
;
then
he
stood
staring
at
a
blank
old
monument
bordered
tastefully
with
skulls
and
cross
-
bones
,
as
if
it
were
the
finest
work
of
Art
he
had
ever
seen
,
although
at
other
times
he
held
it
in
unspeakable
contempt
;
then
he
sat
down
;
then
walked
to
and
fro
again
;
then
went
wandering
up
into
the
organ
-
loft
,
and
touched
the
keys
.
 
<EOS>
But
their
minstrelsy
was
changed
,
their
music
gone
;
and
sounding
one
long
melancholy
chord
<EOS>
,
Tom
drooped
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
gave
it
up
as
hopeless
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
have
cared
,
"
said
Tom
Pinch
,
rising
from
his
stool
and
looking
down
into
the
church
as
if
he
had
been
the
Clergyman
,
"
I
would
n't
have
cared
for
anything
he
might
have
done
to
Me
,
for
I
have
tried
his
patience
often
,
and
have
lived
upon
his
sufferance
and
have
never
been
the
help
to
him
that
others
could
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
minded
,
Pecksniff
,
"
Tom
continued
,
little
thinking
who
heard
him
,
"
if
you
had
done
Me
any
wrong
;
I
could
have
found
plenty
of
excuses
for
that
;
and
though
you
might
have
hurt
me
,
could
have
still
gone
on
respecting
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
did
you
ever
fall
so
low
as
this
in
my
esteem
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
Pecksniff
,
Pecksniff
<EOS>
,
there
is
nothing
I
would
not
have
given
,
to
have
had
you
deserve
my
old
opinion
of
you
;
nothing
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
sat
upon
the
hassock
pulling
up
his
shirt
-
collar
,
while
Tom
,
touched
to
the
quick
,
delivered
this
apostrophe
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
pause
he
heard
Tom
coming
down
the
stairs
,
jingling
the
church
keys
;
and
bringing
his
eye
to
the
top
of
the
pew
again
,
saw
him
go
slowly
out
and
lock
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
durst
not
issue
from
his
place
of
concealment
;
for
through
the
windows
of
the
church
he
saw
Tom
passing
on
among
the
graves
,
and
sometimes
stopping
at
a
stone
,
and
leaning
there
as
if
he
were
a
mourner
who
had
lost
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
he
had
left
the
churchyard
,
Mr
Pecksniff
still
remained
shut
up
;
not
being
at
all
secure
but
that
in
his
restless
state
of
mind
Tom
might
come
wandering
back
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
issued
forth
,
and
walked
with
a
pleasant
countenance
into
the
vestry
;
where
he
knew
there
was
a
window
near
the
ground
,
by
which
he
could
release
himself
by
merely
stepping
out
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
curious
frame
of
mind
,
Mr
Pecksniff
;
being
in
no
hurry
to
go
,
but
rather
inclining
to
a
dilatory
trifling
with
the
time
,
which
prompted
him
to
open
the
vestry
cupboard
,
and
look
at
himself
in
the
parson
's
little
glass
that
hung
within
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
that
his
hair
was
rumpled
,
he
took
the
liberty
of
borrowing
the
canonical
brush
and
arranging
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
took
the
liberty
of
opening
another
cupboard
;
but
he
shut
it
up
again
quickly
,
being
rather
startled
by
the
sight
of
a
black
and
a
white
surplice
dangling
against
the
wall
;
which
had
very
much
the
appearance
of
two
curates
who
had
committed
suicide
by
hanging
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Remembering
that
he
had
seen
in
the
first
cupboard
a
port
-
wine
bottle
and
some
biscuits
,
he
peeped
into
it
again
,
and
helped
himself
with
much
deliberation
;
cogitating
all
the
time
though
,
in
a
very
deep
and
weighty
manner
,
as
if
his
thoughts
were
otherwise
employed
.
   
<EOS>
He
soon
made
up
his
mind
,
if
it
had
ever
been
in
doubt
;
and
putting
back
the
bottle
and
biscuits
,
opened
the
casement
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
out
into
the
churchyard
without
any
difficulty
;
shut
the
window
after
him
;
and
walked
straight
home
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Pinch
indoors
?
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
of
his
serving
-
maid
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
come
in
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
come
in
,
eh
?
"
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
,
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
gone
upstairs
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Yes
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Gone
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
call
him
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
no
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
call
him
,
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
your
relations
,
Jane
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
I
thank
you
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
know
I
asked
about
them
,
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Mr
Chuzzlewit
in
the
way
,
Jane
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
in
the
parlour
,
reading
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
the
parlour
,
reading
,
is
he
,
Jane
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
think
I
'll
go
and
see
him
,
Jane
.
"
   
<EOS>
Never
had
Mr
Pecksniff
been
beheld
in
a
more
pleasant
humour
!
   
<EOS>
But
when
he
walked
into
the
parlour
where
the
old
man
was
engaged
as
Jane
had
said
;
with
pen
and
ink
and
paper
on
a
table
close
at
hand
(
for
Mr
Pecksniff
was
always
very
particular
to
have
him
well
supplied
with
writing
materials
)
,
he
became
less
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
angry
,
he
was
not
vindictive
,
he
was
not
cross
,
he
was
not
moody
,
but
he
was
grieved
;
he
was
sorely
grieved
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
sat
down
by
the
old
man
's
side
,
two
tears
---
not
tears
like
those
with
which
recording
angels
blot
their
entries
out
,
but
drops
so
precious
that
they
use
them
for
their
ink
---
stole
down
his
meritorious
cheeks
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
asked
old
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pecksniff
,
what
ails
you
,
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you
,
my
dear
sir
,
and
I
am
still
more
sorry
for
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
My
good
,
my
worthy
friend
,
I
am
deceived
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
deceived
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
an
agony
,
"
deceived
in
the
tenderest
point
.
 
<EOS>
Cruelly
deceived
in
that
quarter
,
sir
,
in
which
I
placed
the
most
unbounded
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Deceived
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
by
Thomas
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
bad
,
bad
,
bad
!
"
said
Martin
,
laying
down
his
book
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
bad
!
<EOS>
I
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
certain
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certain
,
my
good
sir
!
 
<EOS>
My
eyes
and
ears
are
witnesses
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
believed
it
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
believed
it
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
if
a
Fiery
Serpent
had
proclaimed
it
from
the
top
of
Salisbury
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
said
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
that
the
Serpent
lied
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
my
faith
in
Thomas
Pinch
,
that
I
would
have
cast
the
falsehood
back
into
the
Serpent
's
teeth
,
and
would
have
taken
Thomas
to
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
a
Serpent
,
sir
,
myself
<EOS>
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
and
no
excuse
or
hope
is
left
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
was
greatly
disturbed
to
see
him
so
much
agitated
,
and
to
hear
such
unexpected
news
.
 
<EOS>
He
begged
him
to
compose
himself
,
and
asked
upon
what
subject
Mr
Pinch
's
treachery
had
been
developed
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
almost
the
worst
of
all
,
sir
,
"
Mr
Pecksniff
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
on
a
subject
nearly
concerning
YOU
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
is
it
not
enough
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
upward
,
"
that
these
blows
must
fall
on
me
,
but
must
they
also
hit
my
friends
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
alarm
me
,
"
cried
the
old
man
,
changing
colour
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
so
strong
as
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
You
terrify
me
,
Pecksniff
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
,
my
noble
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
taking
courage
,
"
and
we
will
do
what
is
required
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
know
all
,
sir
,
and
shall
be
righted
.
 
<EOS>
But
first
excuse
me
,
sir
,
excuse
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
duty
to
discharge
,
which
I
owe
to
society
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
rang
the
bell
,
and
Jane
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Send
Mr
Pinch
here
,
if
you
please
,
Jane
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
came
.
 
<EOS>
Constrained
and
altered
in
his
manner
,
downcast
and
dejected
,
visibly
confused
;
not
liking
to
look
Pecksniff
in
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
The
honest
man
bestowed
a
glance
on
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
as
who
should
say
"
You
see
!
"
and
addressed
himself
to
Tom
in
these
terms
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
I
have
left
the
vestry
-
window
unfastened
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
go
and
secure
it
;
then
bring
the
keys
of
the
sacred
edifice
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
vestry
-
window
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
understand
me
,
Mr
Pinch
,
I
think
,
"
returned
his
patron
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr
Pinch
,
the
vestry
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
say
that
sleeping
in
the
church
after
a
fatiguing
ramble
,
I
overheard
just
now
some
fragments
,
"
he
emphasised
that
word
,
"
of
a
dialogue
between
two
parties
;
and
one
of
them
locking
the
church
when
he
went
out
,
I
was
obliged
to
leave
it
myself
by
the
vestry
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
Do
me
the
favour
to
secure
that
vestry
-
window
,
Mr
Pinch
,
and
then
come
back
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
No
physiognomist
that
ever
dwelt
on
earth
could
have
construed
Tom
's
face
when
he
heard
these
words
.
 
<EOS>
Wonder
was
in
it
,
and
a
mild
look
of
reproach
,
but
certainly
no
fear
or
guilt
,
although
a
host
of
strong
emotions
struggled
to
display
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
He
bowed
,
and
without
saying
one
word
,
good
or
bad
,
withdrew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pecksniff
,
"
cried
Martin
,
in
a
tremble
,
"
what
does
all
this
mean
?
<EOS>
You
are
not
going
to
do
anything
in
haste
,
you
may
regret
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
good
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
firmly
,
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
duty
to
discharge
which
I
owe
to
society
;
and
it
shall
be
discharged
,
my
friend
,
at
any
cost
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
late
-
remembered
,
much
-
forgotten
,
mouthing
,
braggart
duty
,
always
owed
,
and
seldom
paid
in
any
other
coin
than
punishment
and
wrath
,
when
will
mankind
begin
to
know
thee
!
 
<EOS>
When
will
men
acknowledge
thee
in
thy
neglected
cradle
,
and
thy
stunted
youth
,
and
not
begin
their
recognition
in
thy
sinful
manhood
and
thy
desolate
old
age
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
ermined
Judge
whose
duty
to
society
is
,
now
,
to
doom
the
ragged
criminal
to
punishment
and
death
,
hadst
thou
<EOS>
never
,
Man
,
a
duty
to
discharge
in
barring
up
the
hundred
open
gates
that
wooed
him
to
the
felon
's
dock
,
and
throwing
but
ajar
the
portals
to
a
decent
life
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
prelate
,
prelate
,
whose
duty
to
society
it
is
to
mourn
in
melancholy
phrase
the
sad
degeneracy
of
these
bad
times
in
which
thy
lot
of
honours
has
been
cast
,
did
nothing
go
before
thy
elevation
to
the
lofty
seat
,
from
which
thou
dealest
out
thy
homilies
to
other
tarriers
for
dead
men
's
shoes
,
whose
duty
to
society
has
not
begun
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
magistrate
,
so
rare
a
country
gentleman
and
brave
a
squire
,
had
you
no
duty
to
society
,
before
the
ricks
were
blazing
and
the
mob
were
mad
;
or
did
it
spring
up
,
armed
and
booted
from
the
earth
,
a
corps
of
yeomanry
full
-
grown
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
's
duty
to
society
could
not
be
paid
till
Tom
came
back
.
<EOS>
The
interval
which
preceded
the
return
of
that
young
man
,
he
occupied
in
a
close
conference
with
his
friend
;
so
that
when
Tom
did
arrive
,
he
found
the
two
quite
ready
to
receive
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
was
in
her
own
room
above
<EOS>
,
whither
Mr
Pecksniff
,
always
considerate
,
had
besought
old
Martin
to
entreat
her
to
remain
some
half
-
hour
longer
,
that
her
feelings
might
be
spared
.
   
<EOS>
When
Tom
came
back
,
he
found
old
Martin
sitting
by
the
window
,
and
Mr
Pecksniff
in
an
imposing
attitude
at
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
him
was
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
and
on
the
other
a
little
heap
(
a
very
little
heap
)
of
gold
and
silver
,
and
odd
pence
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
saw
,
at
a
glance
,
that
it
was
his
own
salary
for
the
current
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
fastened
the
vestry
-
window
,
Mr
Pinch
?
"
said
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Put
down
the
keys
if
you
please
,
Mr
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
placed
them
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
the
bunch
by
the
key
of
the
organ
-
loft
(
though
it
was
one
of
the
smallest
)
,
and
looked
hard
at
it
as
he
laid
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
an
old
,
old
friend
of
Tom
's
;
a
kind
companion
to
him
,
many
and
many
a
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr
Pinch
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
can
look
me
in
the
face
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
did
it
though
;
and
notwithstanding
that
he
has
been
described
as
stooping
generally
,
he
stood
as
upright
then
as
man
could
stand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
taking
up
his
handkerchief
,
as
if
he
felt
that
he
should
want
it
soon
,
"
I
will
not
dwell
upon
the
past
.
<EOS>
I
will
spare
you
,
and
I
will
spare
myself
,
that
pain
at
least
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
was
not
a
very
bright
eye
,
but
it
was
a
very
expressive
one
when
he
looked
at
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
you
will
not
refer
to
the
past
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
present
is
enough
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
dropping
a
penny
,
"
and
the
sooner
THAT
is
past
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
,
I
will
not
dismiss
you
without
a
word
of
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
Even
such
a
course
would
be
quite
justifiable
under
the
circumstances
;
but
it
might
wear
an
appearance
of
hurry
,
and
I
will
not
do
it
;
for
I
am
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
knocking
down
another
penny
,
"
perfectly
self
-
possessed
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
will
say
to
you
,
what
I
have
already
said
to
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
glanced
at
the
old
gentleman
,
who
nodded
now
<EOS>
and
then
as
approving
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
sentences
and
sentiments
,
but
interposed
between
them
in
no
other
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
fragments
of
a
conversation
which
I
overheard
in
the
church
,
just
now
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
"
between
yourself
and
Miss
Graham
<EOS>
---
I
say
fragments
,
because
I
was
slumbering
at
a
considerable
distance
from
you
,
when
I
was
roused
by
your
voices
---
and
from
what
I
saw
,
I
ascertained
<EOS>
(
I
would
have
given
a
great
deal
not
to
have
ascertained
,
Mr
Pinch
)
that
you
,
forgetful
of
all
ties
of
duty
and
of
honour
,
sir
;
regardless
of
the
sacred
laws
of
hospitality
,
to
which
you
were
pledged
as
an
inmate
of
this
house
;
have
presumed
to
address
Miss
Graham
with
unreturned
professions
of
attachment
and
proposals
of
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
looked
at
him
steadily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
deny
it
,
sir
?
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
,
dropping
one
pound
two
and
fourpence
,
and
making
a
great
business
of
picking
it
up
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
replied
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
glancing
at
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Oblige
me
by
counting
this
money
,
Mr
Pinch
,
and
putting
your
name
to
this
receipt
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
No
,
Tom
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
scorned
to
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
that
Mr
Pecksniff
having
overheard
his
own
disgrace
,
cared
not
a
jot
for
sinking
lower
yet
in
his
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
that
he
had
devised
this
fiction
as
the
readiest
means
of
getting
rid
of
him
at
once
,
but
that
it
must
end
in
that
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
that
Mr
Pecksniff
reckoned
on
his
not
denying
it
,
because
his
doing
so
and
explaining
would
incense
the
old
man
more
than
ever
against
Martin
and
against
Mary
;
while
Pecksniff
himself
would
only
have
been
mistaken
in
his
"
fragments
.
<EOS>
"
Deny
it
!
 
<EOS>
No
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
find
the
amount
correct
,
do
you
,
Mr
Pinch
?
"
said
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
correct
,
sir
,
"
answered
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
person
is
waiting
in
the
kitchen
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
to
carry
your
luggage
wherever
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
We
part
,
Mr
Pinch
,
at
once
,
and
are
strangers
from
this
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Something
without
a
name
;
compassion
,
sorrow
,
old
tenderness
,
mistaken
gratitude
,
habit
;
none
of
these
,
and
yet
all
of
them
;
<EOS>
smote
upon
Tom
's
gentle
heart
at
parting
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
such
soul
as
Pecksniff
's
in
that
carcase
;
and
yet
,
though
his
speaking
out
had
not
involved
the
compromise
of
one
he
loved
,
he
could
n't
have
denounced
the
very
shape
and
figure
of
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
Not
even
then
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shedding
tears
,
"
what
a
blow
this
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
how
much
it
tries
me
;
how
it
works
upon
my
nature
;
how
it
grates
upon
my
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
endure
as
well
as
another
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
I
have
to
hope
,
and
what
you
have
to
hope
,
Mr
Pinch
(
otherwise
a
great
responsibility
rests
upon
you
)
,
is
,
that
this
deception
may
not
alter
my
ideas
of
humanity
;
that
it
may
not
impair
my
freshness
,
or
contract
,
if
I
may
use
the
expression
,
my
Pinions
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
not
;
I
do
n't
think
it
will
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
comfort
to
you
,
if
not
now
,
at
some
future
time
,
to
know
that
I
shall
endeavour
not
to
think
the
worse
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
in
general
,
for
what
has
passed
between
us
.
<EOS>
Farewell
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
had
meant
to
spare
him
one
little
puncturation
with
a
lancet
,
which
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
administer
,
but
he
changed
his
mind
on
hearing
this
,
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
left
something
in
the
church
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
aware
that
I
did
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
your
double
eye
-
glass
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
Pecksniff
,
with
some
degree
of
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
obliged
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Put
it
down
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
found
it
,
"
said
Tom
,
slowly
---
"
when
I
went
to
bolt
the
vestry
-
window
---
in
the
pew
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
he
had
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
taken
it
off
when
he
was
bobbing
up
and
down
,
lest
it
should
strike
against
the
panelling
;
and
had
forgotten
it
.
 
<EOS>
Going
back
to
the
church
with
his
mind
full
of
having
been
watched
,
and
wondering
very
much
from
what
part
,
Tom
's
attention
was
caught
by
the
door
of
the
state
pew
standing
open
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
into
it
he
found
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
he
knew
,
and
by
returning
it
gave
Mr
Pecksniff
the
information
that
he
knew
,
where
the
listener
had
been
;
and
that
instead
of
overhearing
fragments
of
the
conversation
,
he
must
have
rejoiced
in
every
word
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
he
's
gone
,
"
said
Martin
,
drawing
a
long
breath
when
Tom
had
left
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
IS
a
relief
,
"
assented
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
great
relief
.
<EOS>
But
having
discharged
---
I
hope
with
tolerable
firmness
---
the
duty
which
I
owed
to
society
,
I
will
now
,
my
dear
sir
,
if
you
will
give
me
leave
,
retire
to
shed
a
few
tears
in
the
back
garden
,
as
an
humble
individual
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
went
upstairs
;
cleared
his
shelf
of
books
;
packed
them
up
with
his
music
and
an
old
fiddle
in
his
trunk
;
got
out
his
clothes
<EOS>
(
they
were
not
so
many
that
they
made
his
head
ache
)
;
put
them
on
the
top
of
his
books
;
and
went
into
the
workroom
for
his
case
of
instruments
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
ragged
stool
there
,
with
the
horsehair
all
sticking
out
of
the
top
like
a
wig
:
<EOS>
a
very
Beast
of
a
stool
in
itself
;
on
which
he
had
taken
up
his
daily
seat
,
year
after
year
,
during
the
whole
period
of
his
service
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
grown
older
and
shabbier
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
Pupils
had
served
their
time
;
seasons
had
come
and
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
and
the
worn
-
out
stool
had
held
together
through
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
That
part
of
the
room
was
traditionally
called
"
Tom
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
"
It
had
been
assigned
to
him
at
first
because
of
its
being
situated
in
a
strong
draught
,
and
a
great
way
from
the
fire
;
and
he
had
occupied
it
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
portraits
of
him
on
the
walls
,
with
all
his
weak
points
monstrously
portrayed
.
 
<EOS>
Diabolical
sentiments
,
foreign
to
his
character
,
were
represented
as
issuing
from
his
mouth
in
fat
balloons
.
 
<EOS>
Every
pupil
had
added
something
,
even
unto
fancy
portraits
of
his
father
with
one
eye
,
and
of
his
mother
with
a
disproportionate
nose
,
and
especially
of
his
sister
;
who
always
being
presented
as
extremely
beautiful
,
made
full
amends
to
Tom
for
any
other
jokes
.
 
<EOS>
Under
less
uncommon
circumstances
,
it
would
have
cut
Tom
to
the
heart
to
leave
these
things
and
think
that
he
saw
them
for
the
last
time
;
but
it
did
n't
now
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
Pecksniff
;
there
never
had
been
a
Pecksniff
;
and
all
his
other
griefs
were
swallowed
up
in
that
.
   
<EOS>
So
,
when
he
returned
into
the
bedroom
,
and
,
having
fastened
his
box
and
a
carpet
-
bag
,
put
on
his
walking
gaiters
,
and
his
great
-
coat
,
and
his
hat
,
and
taken
his
stick
in
his
hand
,
looked
round
it
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
Early
on
summer
mornings
,
and
by
the
light
of
private
candle
-
ends
on
winter
nights
,
he
had
read
himself
half
blind
in
this
same
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
tried
in
this
same
room
to
learn
the
fiddle
under
the
bedclothes
,
but
yielding
to
objections
from
the
other
pupils
,
had
reluctantly
abandoned
the
design
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
other
time
he
would
have
parted
from
it
with
a
pang
,
thinking
of
all
he
had
learned
there
,
of
the
many
hours
he
had
passed
there
;
for
the
love
of
his
very
dreams
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
Pecksniff
;
there
never
had
been
a
Pecksniff
,
and
the
unreality
of
Pecksniff
extended
itself
to
the
chamber
,
in
which
,
sitting
on
one
particular
bed
,
the
thing
supposed
to
be
that
Great
Abstraction
had
often
preached
morality
with
such
effect
that
Tom
had
felt
a
moisture
in
his
eyes
,
while
hanging
breathless
on
the
words
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
engaged
to
bear
his
box
---
Tom
knew
him
well
:
a
Dragon
man
---
 
came
stamping
up
the
stairs
,
and
made
a
roughish
bow
to
Tom
(
to
whom
in
common
times
he
would
have
nodded
with
a
grin
)
as
though
he
were
aware
of
what
had
happened
,
and
wished
him
to
perceive
it
made
no
difference
to
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
clumsily
done
;
he
was
a
mere
waterer
of
horses
;
but
Tom
liked
the
man
for
it
,
and
felt
it
more
than
going
away
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
would
have
helped
him
with
the
box
,
but
he
made
no
more
of
it
,
though
it
was
a
heavy
one
,
than
an
elephant
would
have
made
of
a
castle
;
just
swinging
it
on
his
back
and
bowling
downstairs
as
if
,
being
naturally
a
heavy
sort
of
fellow
,
he
could
carry
a
box
infinitely
better
than
he
could
go
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
took
the
carpet
-
bag
,
and
went
downstairs
along
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
outer
door
stood
Jane
,
crying
with
all
her
might
;
and
on
the
steps
was
Mrs
Lupin
,
sobbing
bitterly
,
and
putting
out
her
hand
for
Tom
to
shake
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
coming
to
the
Dragon
,
Mr
Pinch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
walk
to
Salisbury
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
stay
here
.
 
<EOS>
For
goodness
'
sake
,
do
n't
make
me
so
unhappy
,
Mrs
Lupin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
come
to
the
Dragon
,
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
's
only
for
tonight
.
<EOS>
To
see
me
,
you
know
;
not
as
a
traveller
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
wiping
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
kindness
of
people
is
enough
to
break
one
's
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
go
to
Salisbury
to
-
night
,
my
dear
good
creature
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
take
care
of
my
box
for
me
till
I
write
for
it
,
I
shall
consider
it
the
greatest
kindness
you
can
do
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
cried
Mrs
Lupin
,
"
there
were
twenty
boxes
,
Mr
Pinch
,
that
I
might
have
'em
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
you
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
were
several
people
,
young
and
old
,
standing
about
the
door
,
some
of
whom
cried
with
Mrs
Lupin
;
while
others
tried
to
keep
up
a
stout
heart
,
as
Tom
did
;
and
others
were
absorbed
in
admiration
of
Mr
Pecksniff
---
a
man
who
could
build
a
church
,
as
one
may
say
,
by
squinting
at
a
sheet
of
paper
;
and
others
were
divided
between
that
feeling
and
sympathy
with
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
appeared
on
the
top
of
the
steps
,
simultaneously
with
his
old
pupil
,
and
while
Tom
was
talking
with
Mrs
Lupin
kept
his
hand
stretched
out
,
as
though
he
said
"
Go
forth
!
"
 
<EOS>
When
Tom
went
forth
,
and
had
turned
the
corner
Mr
Pecksniff
shook
his
head
,
shut
his
eyes
,
and
heaving
a
deep
sigh
,
shut
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
On
which
,
the
best
of
Tom
's
supporters
said
he
must
have
done
some
dreadful
deed
,
or
such
a
man
as
Mr
Pecksniff
never
could
have
felt
like
that
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
a
common
quarrel
(
they
observed
)
,
he
would
have
said
something
,
but
when
he
did
n't
,
Mr
Pinch
must
have
shocked
him
dreadfully
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
out
of
hearing
of
their
shrewd
opinions
,
and
plodded
on
as
steadily
as
he
could
go
,
until
he
came
within
sight
of
the
turnpike
where
the
tollman
's
family
had
cried
out
"
Mr
Pinch
!
"
<EOS>
that
frosty
morning
,
when
he
went
to
meet
young
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
got
through
the
village
,
and
this
toll
-
bar
was
his
last
trial
;
but
when
the
infant
toll
-
takers
came
screeching
out
,
he
had
half
a
mind
to
run
for
it
,
and
make
a
bolt
across
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
deary
Mr
Pinch
!
<EOS>
oh
,
deary
sir
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
tollman
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
an
unlikely
time
for
you
to
be
a
-
going
this
way
with
a
bag
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
Salisbury
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
goodness
,
where
's
the
gig
,
then
?
"
cried
the
tollman
's
wife
,
looking
down
the
road
,
as
if
she
thought
Tom
might
have
been
upset
without
observing
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
got
it
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
<EOS>
"
he
could
n't
evade
it
;
he
felt
she
would
have
him
in
the
next
question
,
if
he
got
over
this
one
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
left
Mr
Pecksniff
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
tollman
---
a
crusty
customer
,
always
smoking
solitary
pipes
in
a
Windsor
chair
,
inside
,
set
artfully
between
two
little
windows
that
looked
up
and
down
the
road
,
so
that
when
he
saw
anything
coming
up
he
might
hug
himself
on
having
toll
to
take
,
and
when
he
saw
it
going
down
,
might
hug
himself
on
having
taken
it
---
the
tollman
was
out
in
an
instant
.
   
<EOS>
"
Left
Mr
Pecksniff
!
"
cried
the
tollman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
left
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
tollman
looked
at
his
wife
,
uncertain
whether
to
ask
her
if
she
had
anything
to
suggest
,
or
to
order
her
to
mind
the
children
.
<EOS>
Astonishment
making
him
surly
,
he
preferred
the
latter
,
and
sent
her
into
the
toll
-
house
with
a
flea
in
her
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
left
Mr
Pecksniff
!
"
cried
the
tollman
,
folding
his
arms
,
and
spreading
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
his
head
leaving
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
said
Tom
,
"
<EOS>
so
should
I
,
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
If
a
heavy
drove
of
oxen
had
n't
come
by
immediately
,
the
tollman
would
have
gone
down
to
the
village
straight
,
to
inquire
into
it
.
<EOS>
As
things
turned
out
,
he
smoked
another
pipe
,
and
took
his
wife
into
his
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
But
their
united
sagacity
could
make
nothing
of
it
,
and
they
went
to
bed
---
metaphorically
---
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
But
several
times
that
night
,
when
a
waggon
or
other
vehicle
came
through
,
and
the
driver
asked
the
tollkeeper
<EOS>
"
What
news
?
<EOS>
"
he
looked
at
the
man
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
,
to
assure
himself
that
he
had
an
interest
in
the
subject
,
and
then
said
,
wrapping
his
watch
-
coat
round
his
legs
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
've
heerd
of
Mr
Pecksniff
down
yonder
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
sure
-
ly
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
of
his
young
man
Mr
Pinch
,
p'raps
?
"
   
"
Ah
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
've
parted
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
every
one
of
these
disclosures
,
the
tollman
plunged
into
his
house
again
,
and
was
seen
no
more
,
while
the
other
side
went
on
in
great
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
But
this
was
long
after
Tom
was
abed
,
and
Tom
was
now
with
his
face
towards
Salisbury
,
doing
his
best
to
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
was
beautiful
at
first
,
but
it
became
cloudy
and
dull
at
sunset
,
and
the
rain
fell
heavily
soon
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
For
ten
long
miles
he
plodded
on
,
wet
through
,
until
at
last
the
lights
appeared
,
and
he
came
into
the
welcome
precincts
of
the
city
.
   
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
inn
where
he
had
waited
for
Martin
,
and
briefly
answering
their
inquiries
after
Mr
Pecksniff
,
ordered
a
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
heart
for
tea
or
supper
,
meat
or
drink
of
any
kind
,
but
sat
by
himself
before
an
empty
table
in
the
public
room
while
the
bed
was
getting
ready
,
revolving
in
his
mind
all
that
had
happened
that
eventful
day
,
and
wondering
what
he
could
or
should
do
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
relief
when
the
chambermaid
came
in
,
and
said
the
bed
was
ready
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
low
four
-
poster
,
shelving
downward
in
the
centre
like
a
trough
,
and
the
room
was
crowded
with
impracticable
tables
and
exploded
chests
of
drawers
,
full
of
damp
linen
.
 
<EOS>
A
graphic
representation
in
oil
of
a
remarkably
fat
ox
hung
over
the
fireplace
,
and
the
portrait
of
some
former
landlord
(
who
might
have
been
the
ox
's
brother
<EOS>
,
he
was
so
like
him
)
stared
roundly
in
,
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
A
variety
of
queer
smells
were
partially
quenched
in
the
prevailing
scent
of
very
old
lavender
;
and
the
window
had
not
been
opened
for
such
a
long
space
of
time
that
it
pleaded
immemorial
usage
,
and
would
n't
come
open
now
.
   
<EOS>
These
were
trifles
in
themselves
,
but
they
added
to
the
strangeness
of
the
place
,
and
did
not
induce
Tom
to
forget
his
new
position
.
<EOS>
Pecksniff
had
gone
out
of
the
world
---
had
never
been
in
it
---
and
it
was
as
much
as
Tom
could
do
to
say
his
prayers
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
felt
happier
afterwards
,
and
went
to
sleep
,
and
dreamed
about
him
as
he
Never
Was
.

Treats

of
another

the

upon
the
leads
 
Early
on
the
day
next
after
that
on
which
she
bade
adieu
to
the
halls
of
her
youth
and
the
scenes
of
her
childhood
,
Miss
Pecksniff
,
arriving
safely
at
the
coach
-
office
in
London
,
was
there
received
,
and
conducted
to
her
peaceful
home
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
Monument
,
by
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
M
Todgers
looked
a
little
worn
by
cares
of
gravy
and
other
such
solicitudes
arising
out
of
her
establishment
,
but
displayed
her
usual
earnestness
and
warmth
of
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
,
my
sweet
Miss
Pecksniff
,
"
said
she
,
<EOS>
"
how
is
your
princely
pa
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
signified
(
in
confidence
)
that
he
contemplated
the
introduction
of
a
princely
ma
;
and
repeated
the
sentiment
that
she
was
n't
blind
,
and
was
n't
quite
a
fool
,
and
would
n't
bear
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
was
more
shocked
by
the
intelligence
than
any
one
could
have
expected
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
quite
bitter
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
there
was
no
truth
in
man
and
that
the
warmer
he
expressed
himself
,
as
a
general
principle
,
the
falser
and
more
treacherous
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
foresaw
with
astonishing
clearness
that
the
object
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
attachment
was
designing
,
worthless
,
and
wicked
;
and
receiving
from
Charity
the
fullest
confirmation
of
these
views
,
protested
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
she
loved
Miss
Pecksniff
like
a
sister
,
and
felt
her
injuries
as
if
they
were
her
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
real
darling
sister
,
I
have
not
seen
her
more
than
once
since
her
marriage
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
and
then
I
thought
her
looking
poorly
.
 
<EOS>
My
sweet
Miss
Pecksniff
,
I
always
thought
that
you
was
to
be
the
lady
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Cherry
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Mrs
Todgers
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
not
for
any
consideration
he
could
offer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
are
right
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feared
it
all
along
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
misery
we
have
had
from
that
match
,
here
among
ourselves
,
in
this
house
,
my
dear
Miss
Pecksniff
,
nobody
would
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Lor

Mrs
Todgers

"
   
<EOS>
"
Awful
,
awful

"
repeated
Mrs
Todgers
,
with
strong
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
our
youngest
gentleman
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
,
"
said
Cherry
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
observed
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
how
he
used
to
watch
your
sister
;
and
that
a
kind
of
stony
dumbness
came
over
him
whenever
she
was
in
company
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
never
saw
anything
of
the
sort
,
"
said
Cherry
,
in
a
peevish
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
returned
that
lady
in
a
hollow
voice
,
"
I
have
seen
him
again
and
again
,
sitting
over
his
pie
at
dinner
,
with
his
spoon
a
perfect
fixture
in
his
mouth
,
looking
at
your
sister
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
standing
in
a
corner
of
our
drawing
-
room
,
gazing
at
her
,
in
such
a
lonely
,
melancholy
state
,
that
he
was
more
like
a
Pump
than
a
man
,
and
might
have
drawed
tears
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Cherry
;
"
that
's
all
I
can
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
when
the
marriage
took
place
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
proceeding
with
her
subject
,
"
when
it
was
in
the
paper
,
and
was
read
out
here
at
breakfast
<EOS>
,
I
thought
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
,
I
did
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
The
violence
of
that
young
man
,
my
dear
Miss
Pecksniff
;
the
frightful
opinions
he
expressed
upon
the
subject
of
self
-
destruction
;
the
extraordinary
actions
he
performed
with
his
tea
;
the
clenching
way
in
which
he
bit
his
bread
and
butter
;
the
manner
in
which
he
taunted
Mr
Jinkins
;
all
combined
to
form
a
picture
never
to
be
forgotten
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
he
did
n't
destroy
himself
,
I
think
,
"
observed
Miss
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Himself
!
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
it
took
another
turn
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
for
destroying
other
people
then
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
chaffing
going
on
<EOS>
---
I
hope
you
do
n't
consider
that
a
low
expression
,
Miss
Pecksniff
;
it
is
always
in
our
gentlemen
's
mouths
---
a
little
chaffing
going
on
,
my
dear
,
among
'em
,
all
in
good
nature
,
when
suddenly
he
rose
up
,
foaming
with
his
fury
,
and
<EOS>
but
for
being
held
by
three
would
have
had
Mr
Jinkins
's
life
with
a
bootjack
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
's
face
expressed
supreme
indifference
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
now
he
is
the
meekest
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
almost
bring
the
tears
into
his
eyes
by
looking
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
sits
with
me
the
whole
day
long
on
Sundays
,
talking
in
such
a
dismal
way
that
I
find
it
next
to
impossible
to
keep
my
spirits
up
equal
to
the
accommodation
of
the
boarders
.
 
<EOS>
His
only
comfort
is
in
female
society
.
 
<EOS>
He
takes
me
half
-
price
to
the
play
,
to
an
extent
which
I
sometimes
fear
is
beyond
his
means
;
and
I
see
the
tears
a
-
standing
in
his
eyes
during
the
whole
performance
---
particularly
if
it
is
anything
of
a
comic
nature
.
 
<EOS>
The
turn
I
experienced
only
yesterday
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
putting
her
hand
to
her
side
,
"
when
the
house
-
maid
threw
his
bedside
carpet
out
of
the
window
of
his
room
,
while
I
was
sitting
here
,
no
one
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
him
,
and
that
he
had
done
it
at
last
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
contempt
with
which
Miss
Charity
received
this
pathetic
account
of
the
state
to
which
the
youngest
gentleman
in
company
was
reduced
,
did
not
say
much
for
her
power
of
sympathising
with
that
unfortunate
character
.
 
<EOS>
She
treated
it
with
great
levity
,
and
went
on
to
inform
herself
,
then
and
afterwards
,
whether
any
other
changes
had
occurred
in
the
commercial
boarding
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
was
gone
,
and
had
been
succeeded
(
such
is
the
decay
of
human
greatness
!
)
<EOS>
by
an
old
woman
whose
name
was
reported
to
be
Tamaroo
---
which
seemed
an
impossibility
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
it
appeared
in
the
fullness
of
time
that
the
jocular
boarders
had
appropriated
the
word
from
an
English
ballad
,
in
which
it
is
supposed
to
express
the
bold
and
fiery
nature
of
a
certain
hackney
coachman
;
and
that
it
was
bestowed
upon
Mr
Bailey
's
successor
by
reason
of
her
having
nothing
fiery
about
her
,
except
an
occasional
attack
of
that
fire
which
is
called
St.
Anthony
's
.
 
<EOS>
This
ancient
female
had
been
engaged
,
in
fulfillment
of
a
vow
,
registered
by
Mrs
Todgers
,
that
no
more
boys
should
darken
the
commercial
doors
;
and
she
was
chiefly
remarkable
for
a
total
absence
of
all
comprehension
upon
every
subject
<EOS>
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
perfect
Tomb
for
messages
and
small
parcels
;
and
when
dispatched
to
the
Post
Office
with
letters
,
had
been
frequently
seen
endeavouring
to
insinuate
them
into
casual
chinks
in
private
doors
,
under
the
delusion
that
any
door
with
a
hole
in
it
would
answer
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
very
little
old
woman
,
and
always
wore
a
very
coarse
apron
with
a
bib
before
and
a
loop
behind
,
together
with
bandages
on
her
wrists
,
which
appeared
to
be
afflicted
with
an
everlasting
sprain
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
on
all
occasions
chary
of
opening
the
street
door
,
and
ardent
to
shut
it
again
;
and
she
waited
at
table
in
a
bonnet
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
only
great
change
over
and
above
the
change
which
had
fallen
on
the
youngest
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
him
,
he
more
than
corroborated
the
account
of
Mrs
Todgers
;
possessing
greater
sensibility
than
even
she
had
given
him
credit
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
entertained
some
terrible
notions
of
Destiny
,
among
other
matters
,
and
talked
much
about
people
's
"
Missions
"
;
upon
which
he
seemed
to
have
some
private
information
not
generally
attainable
,
as
he
knew
it
had
been
poor
Merry
's
mission
to
crush
him
in
the
bud
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
frail
and
tearful
;
for
being
aware
that
a
shepherd
's
mission
was
to
pipe
to
his
flocks
,
and
that
a
boatswain
's
mission
was
to
pipe
all
hands
,
and
that
one
man
's
mission
was
to
be
a
paid
piper
,
and
another
man
's
mission
was
to
pay
the
piper
,
so
he
had
got
it
into
his
head
that
his
own
peculiar
mission
was
to
pipe
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Which
he
did
perpetually
.
   
<EOS>
He
often
informed
Mrs
Todgers
that
the
sun
had
set
upon
him
;
that
the
billows
had
rolled
over
him
;
that
the
car
of
Juggernaut
had
crushed
him
,
and
also
that
the
deadly
Upas
tree
of
Java
had
blighted
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
was
Moddle
.
   
<EOS>
Towards
this
most
unhappy
Moddle
,
Miss
Pecksniff
conducted
herself
at
first
with
distant
haughtiness
,
being
in
no
humour
to
be
entertained
with
dirges
in
honour
of
her
married
sister
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
young
gentleman
was
additionally
crushed
by
this
,
and
remonstrated
with
Mrs
Todgers
on
the
subject

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Even
she
turns
from
me
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
said
Moddle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
n't
you
try
and
be
a
little
bit
more
cheerful
,
sir
?
"
retorted
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cheerful
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
<EOS>
cheerful
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
youngest
gentleman
;
"
when
she
reminds
me
of
days
for
ever
fled
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
had
better
avoid
her
for
a
short
time
,
if
she
does
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
and
come
to
know
her
again
,
by
degrees
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
advice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
avoid
her
,
"
replied
Moddle
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
n't
strength
of
mind
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
if
you
knew
what
a
comfort
her
nose
is
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Her
nose
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
cried
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
profile
,
in
general
,
"
said
the
youngest
gentleman
,
"
but
particularly
her
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
so
like
;
"
here
he
yielded
to
a
burst
of
grief
.
 
<EOS>
"
it
's
so
like
hers
who
is
Another
's
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
observant
matron
did
not
fail
to
report
this
conversation
to
Charity
,
who
laughed
at
the
time
,
but
treated
Mr
Moddle
that
very
evening
with
increased
consideration
,
and
presented
her
side
face
to
him
as
much
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Moddle
was
not
less
sentimental
than
usual
;
was
rather
more
so
,
if
anything
;
but
he
sat
and
stared
at
her
with
glistening
eyes
,
and
seemed
grateful
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
"
said
the
lady
of
the
Boarding
-
House
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
held
up
your
head
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
coming
round
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
because
she
's
so
like
her
who
is
Another
's
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
rejoined
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
she
talks
,
and
when
she
smiles
,
I
think
I
'm
looking
on
HER
brow
again
,
Mrs
Todgers
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
likewise
carried
to
Charity
,
who
talked
and
smiled
next
evening
in
her
most
engaging
manner
,
and
rallying
Mr
Moddle
on
the
lowness
of
his
spirits
,
challenged
him
to
play
a
rubber
at
cribbage
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moddle
taking
up
the
gauntlet
,
they
played
several
rubbers
for
sixpences
,
and
Charity
won
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
This
may
have
been
partially
attributable
to
the
gallantry
of
the
youngest
gentleman
,
but
it
was
certainly
referable
to
the
state
of
his
feelings
also
;
for
his
eyes
being
frequently
dimmed
by
tears
<EOS>
,
he
thought
that
aces
were
tens
,
and
knaves
queens
,
which
at
times
occasioned
some
confusion
in
his
play
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
seventh
night
of
cribbage
,
when
Mrs
Todgers
,
sitting
by
,
proposed
that
instead
of
gambling
they
should
play
for
"
love
,
"
Mr
Moddle
was
seen
to
change
colour
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
fourteenth
night
,
he
kissed
Miss
Pecksniff
's
snuffers
,
in
the
passage
,
when
she
went
upstairs
to
bed
;
meaning
to
have
kissed
her
hand
,
but
missing
it
.
   
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mr
Moddle
began
to
be
impressed
with
the
idea
that
Miss
Pecksniff
's
mission
was
to
comfort
him
;
and
Miss
Pecksniff
began
to
speculate
on
the
probability
of
its
being
her
mission
to
become
ultimately
Mrs
Moddle
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
gentleman
(
Miss
Pecksniff
was
not
a
very
young
lady
)
with
rising
prospects
,
and
"
almost
"
enough
to
live
on
.
 
<EOS>
Really
it
looked
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
Besides
---
besides
---
he
had
been
regarded
as
devoted
to
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
Merry
had
joked
about
him
,
and
had
once
spoken
of
it
to
her
sister
as
a
conquest
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
better
looking
,
better
shaped
,
better
spoken
,
better
tempered
,
better
mannered
than
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
easy
to
manage
,
could
be
made
to
consult
the
humours
of
his
Betrothed
,
and
could
be
shown
off
like
a
lamb
when
Jonas
was
a
bear
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
rub
!
   
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
cribbage
went
on
,
and
Mrs
Todgers
went
off
;
for
the
youngest
gentleman
,
dropping
her
society
,
began
to
take
Miss
Pecksniff
to
the
play
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
began
,
as
Mrs
Todgers
said
,
to
slip
home
"
in
his
dinner
-
times
,
"
and
to
get
away
from
"
the
office
"
at
unholy
seasons
;
and
twice
,
as
he
informed
Mrs
Todgers
himself
,
he
received
anonymous
letters
,
enclosing
cards
from
Furniture
Warehouses
---
clearly
the
act
of
that
ungentlemanly
ruffian
Jinkins
;
only
he
had
n't
evidence
enough
to
call
him
out
upon
.
 
<EOS>
All
of
which
,
so
Mrs
Todgers
told
Miss
Pecksniff
,
spoke
as
plain
English
as
the
shining
sun
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Pecksniff
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
that
he
is
burning
to
propose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
goodness
me
,
why
do
n't
he
then
?
"
cried
Cherry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Men
are
so
much
more
timid
than
we
think
'em
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
baulk
themselves
continually
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
words
on
Todgers
's
lips
for
months
and
months
and
months
,
before
he
said
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
submitted
that
Todgers
might
not
have
been
a
fair
specimen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
bless
you
,
yes
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
particular
in
those
days
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
bridling
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
You
give
Mr
Moddle
a
little
encouragement
,
Miss
Pecksniff
,
if
you
wish
him
to
speak
;
and
he
'll
speak
fast
enough
,
depend
upon
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
encouragement
he
would
have
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
returned
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
walks
with
me
,
and
plays
cards
with
me
,
and
he
comes
and
sits
alone
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
right
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
indispensable
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
sits
very
close
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Also
quite
correct
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
looks
at
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
he
does
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
has
his
arm
upon
the
back
of
the
chair
or
sofa
,
or
whatever
it
is
---
behind
me
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
begins
to
cry
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
admitted
that
he
might
do
better
than
that
;
and
might
undoubtedly
profit
by
the
recollection
of
the
great
Lord
Nelson
's
signal
at
the
battle
of
Trafalgar
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
she
said
,
he
would
come
round
,
or
,
not
to
mince
the
matter
,
would
be
brought
round
,
if
Miss
Pecksniff
took
up
a
decided
position
,
and
plainly
showed
him
that
it
must
be
done
.
   
<EOS>
Determining
to
regulate
her
conduct
by
this
opinion
,
the
young
lady
received
Mr
Moddle
,
on
the
earliest
subsequent
occasion
,
with
an
air
of
constraint
;
and
gradually
leading
him
to
inquire
,
in
a
dejected
manner
,
why
she
was
so
changed
,
confessed
to
him
that
she
felt
it
necessary
for
their
mutual
peace
and
happiness
to
take
a
decided
step
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
much
together
lately
,
she
observed
,
much
together
,
and
had
tasted
the
sweets
of
a
genuine
reciprocity
of
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
could
forget
him
,
nor
could
she
ever
cease
to
think
of
him
with
feelings
of
the
liveliest
friendship
,
but
people
had
begun
to
talk
,
the
thing
had
been
observed
,
and
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
nothing
more
to
each
other
,
than
any
gentleman
and
lady
in
society
usually
are
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
glad
she
had
had
the
resolution
to
say
thus
much
before
her
feelings
had
been
tried
too
far
;
they
had
been
greatly
tried
,
she
would
admit
;
but
though
she
was
weak
and
silly
,
she
would
soon
get
the
better
of
it
,
she
hoped
.
   
<EOS>
Moddle
,
who
had
by
this
time
become
in
the
last
degree
maudlin
,
and
wept
abundantly
,
inferred
from
the
foregoing
avowal
,
that
it
was
his
mission
to
communicate
to
others
the
blight
which
had
fallen
on
himself
;
and
that
,
being
a
kind
of
unintentional
Vampire
,
he
had
had
Miss
Pecksniff
assigned
to
him
by
the
Fates
,
as
Victim
Number
One
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
controverting
this
opinion
as
sinful
<EOS>
,
Moddle
was
goaded
on
to
ask
whether
she
could
be
contented
with
a
blighted
heart
;
and
it
appearing
on
further
examination
that
she
could
be
,
plighted
his
dismal
troth
,
which
was
accepted
and
returned
.
   
<EOS>
He
bore
his
good
fortune
with
the
utmost
moderation
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
being
triumphant
,
he
shed
more
tears
than
he
had
ever
been
known
to
shed
before
;
and
,
sobbing
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
day
this
has
been
!
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
go
back
to
the
office
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Oh

what
a
trying
day
this
has
been

Good
Gracious

Further

proceeding
out

<EOS>
Martin
makes
a
discovery
of
some
importance
 
From
Mr
Moddle
to
Eden
is
an
easy
and
natural
transition
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Moddle
,
living
in
the
atmosphere
of
Miss
Pecksniff
's
love
,
dwelt
(
if
he
had
but
known
it
)
in
a
terrestrial
Paradise
.
 
<EOS>
The
thriving
city
of
Eden
was
also
a
terrestrial
Paradise
,
upon
the
showing
of
its
proprietors
.
 
<EOS>
The
beautiful
Miss
Pecksniff
might
have
been
poetically
described
as
a
something
too
good
for
man
in
his
fallen
and
degraded
state
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
exactly
the
character
of
the
thriving
city
of
Eden
,
as
poetically
heightened
by
Zephaniah
Scadder
,
General
Choke
,
and
other
worthies
;
part
and
parcel
of
the
talons
of
that
great
American
Eagle
,
which
is
always
airing
itself
sky
-
high
in
purest
aether
,
and
never
,
no
never
,
never
,
tumbles
down
with
draggled
wings
into
the
mud
.

When
Mark
Tapley
,
leaving
Martin
in
the
architectural
and
surveying
offices
,
had
effectually
strengthened
and
encouraged
his
own
spirits
by
the
contemplation
of
their
joint
misfortunes
,
he
proceeded
,
with
new
cheerfulness
,
in
search
of
help
;
congratulating
himself
,
as
he
went
along
,
on
the
enviable
position
to
which
he
had
at
last
attained
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
think
,
sometimes
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
"
as
a
desolate
island
would
suit
me
,
but
I
should
only
have
had
myself
to
provide
for
there
,
and
being
naturally
a
easy
man
to
manage
<EOS>
,
there
would
n't
have
been
much
credit
in
THAT
.
 
<EOS>
Now
here
I
've
got
my
partner
to
take
care
on
,
and
he
's
something
like
the
sort
of
man
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
a
man
as
is
always
a

sliding
off
his
legs
when
he
ought
to
be
on
'em

<EOS>
I
want
a
man
as
is
so
low
down
in
the
school
of
life
that
he
's
always
a

making
figures
of
one
in
his
copy

book

and
ca
n't
get
no

<EOS>
I
want
a
man
as
is
his

great

cloak

is
always
a

wrapping
himself
up
in
himself

<EOS>
And
I
have
got
him
too
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
happiness
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
paused
to
look
round
,
uncertain
to
which
of
the
log
-
houses
he
should
repair
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
which
to
take
,
"
he
observed
;
"
that
's
the
truth
.
<EOS>
They
're
equally
prepossessing
outside
,
and
equally
commodious
,
no
doubt
,
within
;
being
fitted
up
with
every
convenience
that
a
Alligator
,
in
a
state
of
natur

,
could
possibly
require
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
!
 
<EOS>
The
citizen
as
turned
out
last
night
,
lives
under
water
,
in
the
right
hand
dog
-
kennel
at
the
corner

<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
trouble
him
if
I
can
help
it
,
poor
man
,
<EOS>
for
he
is
a
melancholy
object
;
a
reg'lar
Settler
in
every
respect
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
house
with
a
winder
,
but
I
am
afraid
of
their
being
proud
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
a
door
ai
n't
too
aristocratic
;
but
here
goes
for
the
first
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
went
up
to
the
nearest
cabin
,
and
knocked
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Being
desired
to
enter
,
he
complied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Neighbour
,
"
said
Mark
;
"
for
I
AM
a
neighbour
,
though
you
do
n't

Hallo

lo

"
   
<EOS>
He
made
this
exclamation
on
hearing
his
own
name
pronounced
,
and
finding
himself
clasped
about
the
skirts
by
two
little
boys
,
whose
faces
he
had
often
washed
,
and
whose
suppers
he

often
cooked

and
that
ai
n't
her
husband
as
come
to
New
York
to
fetch
her
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
these
,
"
he
added
,
looking
down
upon
the
boys
,
"
ai
n't
them
two
young
shavers
as
was
so
familiar
to
me
;
though
they
are
uncommon
like
'em
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
must
confess
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
woman
shed
tears
,
in
very
joy
to
see
him
;
the
man
shook
both
his
hands
and
would
not
let
them
go
;
the
two
boys
hugged
his
legs
;
the
sick
child
in
the
mother
's
arms
stretched
out
her
burning
little
fingers
,
and
muttered
,
in
her
hoarse
,
dry
throat
,
his
well
-
remembered
name
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
family
,
sure
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Altered
by
the
salubrious
air
of
Eden
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
new
sort
of
a
morning
call
,
"
said
Mark
,
drawing
a
long
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
strikes
one
all
of
a
heap
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
a
little
bit
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
-
coming
round
fast
.
 
<EOS>
That
'll
do
!
 
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
ai
n't
my
friends
.
<EOS>
Are
they
on
the
visiting
list
of
the
house
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
inquiry
referred
to
certain
gaunt
pigs
,
who
had
walked
in
after
him
,
and
were
much
interested
in
the
heels
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
did
not
belong
to
the
mansion
,
they
were
expelled
by
the
two
little
boys
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
superstitious
about
toads
,
"
said
Mark
,
looking
round
the
room
,
"
but
if
you
could
prevail
upon
the
two
or
three
I
see
in
company
,
to
step
out
at
the
same
time
,
my
young
friends
<EOS>
,
I
think
they
'd
find
the
open
air
refreshing
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
at
all
object
to
'em
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
handsome
animal
is
a
toad
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
sitting
down
upon
a
stool
;
"
very
spotted
;
very
like
a
partickler
style
of
old
gentleman
about
the
throat
;
very
bright
-
eyed
,
very
cool
,
and
very
slippy
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
sees
'em
to
the
best
advantage
out
of
doors
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
While
pretending
,
with
such
talk
as
this
,
to
be
perfectly
at
his
ease
,
and
to
be
the
most
indifferent
and
careless
of
men
,
Mark
Tapley
had
an
eye
on
all
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
wan
and
meagre
aspect
of
the
family
,
the
changed
looks
of
the
poor
mother
,
the
fevered
child
she
held
in
her
lap
,
the
air
of
great
despondency
and
little
hope
on
everything
,
were
plain
to
him
,
and
made
a
deep
impression
on
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
it
all
as
clearly
and
as
quickly
,
as
with
his
bodily
eyes
he
saw
the
rough
shelves
supported
by
pegs
driven
between
the
logs
,
of
which
the
house
was
made
;
the
flour
-
cask
in
the
corner
,
serving
also
for
a
table
;
the
blankets
,
spades
,
and
other
articles
against
the
walls
;
the
damp
that
blotched
the
ground
;
or
the
crop
of
vegetable
rottenness
in
every
crevice
of
the
hut
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
that
you
have
come
here
?
"
asked
the
man
,
when
their
first
expressions
of
surprise
were
over
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
we
come
by
the
steamer
last
night
,
"
replied
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
intention
is
to
make
our
fortuns
with
punctuality
and
dispatch
;
and
to
retire
upon
our
property
as
soon
as
ever
it
's
realised
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
are
you
all
?
 
<EOS>
You
're
looking
noble
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
but
<EOS>
sickly
now
,
"
said
the
poor
woman
,
bending
over
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
we
shall
do
better
when
we
are
seasoned
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
here
,
"
thought
Mark
"
whose
seasoning
will
last
for
ever
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
he
said
cheerfully
,
"
Do
better
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
all
do
better
.
 
<EOS>
What
we
've
got
to
do
is
,
to
keep
up
our
spirits
,
and
be
neighbourly
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
come
all
right
in
the
end
,
never
fear
.
<EOS>
That
reminds
me
,
by
the
bye
,
that
my
partner
's
all
wrong
just
at
present
;
and
that
I
looked
in
to
beg
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
come
and
give
me
your
opinion
of
him
,
master
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
must
have
been
a
very
unreasonable
request
on
the
part
of
Mark
Tapley
,
with
which
,
in
their
gratitude
for
his
kind
offices
on
board
the
ship
,
they
would
not
have
complied
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
rose
to
accompany
him
without
a
moment
's
delay
.
 
<EOS>
Before
they
went
,
Mark
took
the
sick
child
in
his
arms
,
and
tried
to
comfort
the
mother
;
but
the
hand
of
death
was
on
it
then
,
he
saw
.
   
<EOS>
They
found
Martin
in
the
house
,
lying
wrapped
up
in
his
blanket
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
to
all
appearance
,
very
ill
indeed
,
and
shook
and
shivered
horribly
;
not
as
people
do
from
cold
,
but
in
a
frightful
kind
of
spasm
or
convulsion
,
that
racked
his
whole
body
.
<EOS>
Mark
's
friend
pronounced
his
disease
an
aggravated
kind
of
fever
,
accompanied
with
ague
;
which
was
very
common
in
those
parts
,
and
which
he
predicted
would
be
worse
to
-
morrow
,
and
for
many
more
to
-
morrows
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
it
himself
off
and
on
,
he
said
,
for
a
couple
of
years
or
so
;
but
he
was
thankful
that
,
while
so
many
he
had
known
had
died
about
him
,
he
had
escaped
with
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
with
not
too
much
of
that
,
"
thought
Mark
,
surveying
his
emaciated
form
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eden
for
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
had
some
medicine
in
their
chest
;
and
this
man
of
sad
experience
showed
Mark
how
and
when
to
administer
it
,
and
how
he
could
best
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
His
attentions
did
not
stop
there
;
for
he
was
backwards
and
forwards
constantly
,
and
rendered
Mark
good
service
in
all
his
brisk
attempts
to
make
their
situation
more
endurable
.
 
<EOS>
Hope
or
comfort
for
the
future
he
could
not
bestow
.
 
<EOS>
The
season
was
a
sickly
one
;
the
settlement
a
grave
.
<EOS>
His
child
died
that
night
;
and
Mark
,
keeping
the
secret
from
Martin
,
helped
to
bury
it
,
beneath
a
tree
,
next
day
.
   
<EOS>
With
all
his
various
duties
of
attendance
upon
Martin
(
who
became
the
more
exacting
in
his
claims
,
the
worse
he
grew
)
,
Mark
worked
out
of
doors
,
early
and
late
;
and
with
the
assistance
of
his
friend
and
others
,
laboured
to
do
something
with
their
land
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
he
had
the
least
strength
of
heart
or
hope
,
or
steady
purpose
in
so
doing
,
beyond
the
habitual
cheerfulness
of
his
disposition
,
and
his
amazing
power
of
self
-
sustainment
;
for
within
himself
,
he
looked
on
their
condition
as
beyond
all
hope
,
and
,
in
his
own
words
,
"
came
out
strong
"
in
consequence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
coming
out
as
strong
as
I
could
wish
,
sir
,
"
he
confided
to
Martin
in
a
leisure
moment
;
that
is
to
say
,
one
evening
,
while
he
was
washing
the
linen
of
the
establishment
,
after
a
hard
day
's
work
,
"
that
I
give
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
piece
of
good
fortune
as
never
is
to
happen
to
me
,
I
see
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
wish
for
circumstances
stronger
than
these
?
"
<EOS>
Martin
retorted
with
a
groan
,
from
underneath
his
blanket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
only
see
how
easy
they
might
have
been
stronger
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
if
it
was
n't
for
the
envy
of
that
uncommon
fortun
of
mine
,
which
is
always
after
me
,
and
tripping
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
we
landed
here
,
I
thought
things
did
look
pretty
jolly
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
they
did
look
pretty
jolly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
they
look
now
?
"
groaned
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mark
,
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
they
look
now
?
 
<EOS>
On
the
very
first
morning
of
my
going
out
,
what
do
I
do
?
<EOS>
Stumble
on
a
family
I
know
,
who
are
constantly
assisting
of
us
in
all
sorts
of
ways
,
from
that
time
to
this
!
 
<EOS>
That
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
;
that
ai
n't
<EOS>
what
I
'd
a
right
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
stumbled
on
a
serpent
and
got
bit
;
or
stumbled
on
a
first
-
rate
patriot
,
and
got
bowie
-
knifed
,
or
stumbled
on
a
lot
of
Sympathisers
with
inverted
shirt
-
collars
,
and
got
made
a
lion
of
;
I
might
have
distinguished
myself
,
and
earned
some
credit
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
the
great
object
of
my
voyage
is
knocked
on
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
would
be
,
wherever
I
went
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
feel
to
-
night
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Worse
than
ever
,
"
said
poor
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
something
,
"
returned
Mark
,
"
but
not
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
but
being
very
bad
myself
,
and
jolly
to
the
last
,
will
ever
do
me
justice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
Heaven
's
name
,
do
n't
talk
of
that
,
"
said
Martin
with
a
thrill
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
do
,
Mark
,
if
you
were
taken
ill
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
's
spirits
appeared
to
be
stimulated
by
this
remark
,
although
it
was
not
a
very
flattering
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
proceeded
with
his
washing
in
a
brighter
mood
;
and
observed
"
that
his
glass
was
arising
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
one
good
thing
in
this
place
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
scrubbing
away
at
the
linen
,
"
as
disposes
me
to
be
jolly
;
and
that
is
that
it
's
a
reg'lar
little
United
States
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
two
or
three
American
settlers
left
;
and
they
coolly
comes
over
one
,
even
here
,
sir
,
as
if
it
was
the
wholesomest
and
loveliest
spot
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
're
like
the
cock
that
went
and
hid
himself
to
save
his
life
,
and
was
found
out
by
the
noise
he
made
.
 
<EOS>
They
ca
n't
help
crowing
.
 
<EOS>
They
was
born
to
do
it
,
and
do
it
<EOS>
they
must
,
<EOS>
whatever
comes
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Glancing
from
his
work
out
at
the
door
as
he
said
these
words
,
Mark
's
eyes
encountered
a
lean
person
in
a
blue
frock
and
a
straw
hat
,
with
a
short
black
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
a
great
hickory
stick
studded
all
over
with
knots
,
in
his
hand
;
who
smoking
and
chewing
as
he
came
along
,
and
spitting
frequently
,
recorded
his
progress
by
a
train
of
decomposed
tobacco
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
one
on
'
em
,
"
cried
Mark
,
"
Hannibal
Chollop
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
him
in
,
"
said
Martin
,
feebly
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
want
any
letting
in
,
"
replied
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
come
in
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
Which
turned
out
to
be
quite
true
,
for
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
was
almost
as
hard
and
knobby
as
his
stick
;
and
so
were
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
was
like
an
old
black
hearth
-
broom
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
on
the
chest
with
his
hat
on
;
and
crossing
his
legs
and
looking
up
at
Mark
,
said
,
without
removing
his
pipe
:
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Co.
!
<EOS>
and
how
do
you
git
along
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
to
observe
that
Mr
Tapley
had
gravely
introduced
himself
to
all
strangers
,
by
that
name
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
sir
;
pretty
well
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
this
ai
n't
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
ai
n't
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
visitor
<EOS>
"
How
do
YOU
git
along
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
shook
his
head
,
and
drew
the
blanket
over
it
involuntarily
;
for
he
felt
that
Hannibal
was
going
to
spit
;
and
his
eye
,
as
the
song
says
,
was
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
regard
me
,
sir
,
"
observed
Mr
Chollop
,
complacently
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
fever
-
proof
,
and
likewise
agur
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mine
was
a
more
selfish
motive
,
"
said
Martin
,
looking
out
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
you
were
going
to
---
"
   
"
I
can
calc'late
my
distance
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Chollop
,
"
to
an
inch
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
proof
of
which
happy
faculty
he
immediately
favoured
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
re
-
quire
,
sir
,
"
said
Hannibal
,
"
two
foot
clear
in
a
circ'lar
di
-
rection
,
and
can
engage
my
-
self
toe
keep
within
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
HAVE
gone
ten
foot
,
in
a
circ'lar
di
-
rection
,
but
that
was
for
a
wager
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
won
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
I
realised
the
stakes
,
"
said
Chollop
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
silent
for
a
time
,
during
which
he
was
actively
engaged
in
the
formation
of
a
magic
circle
round
the
chest
on
which
he
sat
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
completed
,
he
began
to
talk
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
like
our
country
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
looking
at
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
was
the
invalid
's
reply
.
   
<EOS>
Chollop
continued
to
smoke
without
the
least
appearance
of
emotion
,
until
he
felt
disposed
to
speak
again
.
 
<EOS>
That
time
at
length
arriving
<EOS>
,
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
and
said
:
   
"
I
am
not
surprised
to
hear
you
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
re
-
quires
An
elevation
,
and
A
preparation
of
the
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
The
mind
of
man
must
be
prepared
for
Freedom
,
<EOS>
Mr
Co.
"
   
He
addressed
himself
to
Mark
;
because
he
saw
that
Martin
,
who
wished
him
to
go
,
being
already
half
-
mad
with
feverish
irritation
,
which
the
droning
voice
of
this
new
horror
rendered
almost
insupportable
,
had
closed
his
eyes
,
and
turned
on
his
uneasy
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
bodily
preparation
would
n't
be
amiss
,
either
,
would
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
in
the
case
of
a
blessed
old
swamp
like
this
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
con
-
sider
this
<EOS>
a
swamp
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Chollop
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
a
doubt
about
it
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
sentiment
is
quite
Europian
,
"
said
the
major
,
"
and
does
not
surprise
me
;
what
would
your
English
millions
say
to
such
a
swamp
in
England
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
'd
say
it
was
an
uncommon
nasty
one
<EOS>
,
I
should
think
,
said
Mark
;
"
and
that
they
would
rather
be
inoculated
for
fever
in
some
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Europian
!
"
remarked
Chollop
,
with
sardonic
pity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
Europian
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
there
he
sat
.
 
<EOS>
Silent
and
cool
<EOS>
,
as
if
the
house
were
his
;
smoking
away
like
a
factory
chimney
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chollop
was
,
of
course
,
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
the
country
;
but
he
really
was
a
notorious
person
besides
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
usually
described
by
his
friends
,
in
the
South
and
West
,
as
"
a
splendid
sample
of
our
na
-
tive
raw
material
,
sir
,
"
and
was
much
esteemed
for
his
devotion
to
rational
Liberty
;
for
the
better
propagation
whereof
he
usually
carried
a
brace
of
revolving
pistols
in
his
coat
pocket
,
with
seven
barrels
a
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
carried
,
amongst
other
trinkets
,
a
sword
-
stick
,
which
he
called
his
"
Tickler
.
"
and
a
great
knife
,
which
(
for
he
was
a
man
of
a
pleasant
turn
of
humour
)
<EOS>
he
called
"
Ripper
,
"
in
allusion
to
its
usefulness
as
a
means
of
ventilating
the
stomach
of
any
adversary
in
a
close
contest
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
used
these
weapons
with
distinguished
effect
in
several
instances
,
all
duly
chronicled
in
the
newspapers
;
and
was
greatly
beloved
for
the
gallant
manner
in
which
he
had
"
jobbed
out
"
the
eye
of
one
gentleman
,
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
knocking
at
his
own
street
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chollop
was
a
man
of
a
roving
disposition
;
and
,
in
any
less
advanced
community
,
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
violent
vagabond
.
<EOS>
But
his
fine
qualities
being
perfectly
understood
and
appreciated
in
those
regions
where
his
lot
was
cast
,
and
where
he
had
many
kindred
spirits
to
consort
with
,
he
may
be
regarded
as
having
been
born
under
a
fortunate
star
,
which
is
not
always
the
case
with
a
man
so
much
before
the
age
in
which
he
lives
.
 
<EOS>
Preferring
,
with
a
view
to
the
gratification
of
his
tickling
and
ripping
fancies
,
to
dwell
upon
the
outskirts
of
society
,
and
in
the
more
remote
towns
and
cities
,
he
was
in
the
habit
of
emigrating
from
place
to
place
,
and
establishing
in
each
some
business
---
usually
a
newspaper
---
which
he
presently
sold
;
for
the
most
part
closing
the
bargain
by
challenging
,
stabbing
,
pistolling
,
or
gouging
the
new
editor
,
before
he
had
quite
taken
possession
of
the
property
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
Eden
on
a
speculation
of
this
kind
,
but
had
abandoned
it
,
and
was
about
to
leave
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
introduced
himself
to
strangers
as
a
worshipper
of
Freedom
;
was
the
consistent
advocate
of
Lynch
law
,
and
slavery
;
and
invariably
recommended
,
both
in
print
and
speech
,
the
"
tarring
and
feathering
"
of
any
unpopular
person
who
differed
from
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
called
this
"
planting
the
standard
of
civilization
in
the
wilder
gardens
of
My
country
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Chollop
would
have
planted
this
standard
in
Eden
at
Mark
's
expense
,
in
return
for
his
plainness
of
speech
(
for
the
genuine
Freedom
is
dumb
,
save
when
she
vaunts
herself
)
,
but
for
the
utter
desolation
and
decay
prevailing
in
the
settlement
,
and
his
own
approaching
departure
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
contented
himself
with
showing
Mark
one
of
the
revolving
-
pistols
,
and
asking
him
what
he
thought
of
that
weapon
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
long
since
I
shot
a
man
down
with
that
,
sir
,
in
the
State
of
IllinOY
,
"
observed
Chollop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
,
indeed
!
"
said
Mark
,
without
the
smallest
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
free
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
very
independent
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shot
him
down
,
sir
,
"
pursued
Chollop
,
"
for
asserting
in
the
Spartan
Portico
,
a
tri
-
weekly
journal
,
that
the
ancient
Athenians
went
a
-
head
of
the
present
Locofoco
Ticket
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
's
that
?
"
asked
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Europian
not
to
know
,
"
said
Chollop
,
smoking
placidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Europian
quite
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
short
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
magic
circle
,
he
resumed
the
conversation
by
observing
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
half
feel
yourself
at
home
in
Eden
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
miss
the
imposts
of
your
country
.
 
<EOS>
You
miss
the
house
dues
?
<EOS>
"
observed
Chollop
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
houses
---
rather
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
window
dues
here
,
sir
,
"
observed
Chollop
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
no
windows
to
put
'em
on
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
stakes
,
no
dungeons
,
no
blocks
,
no
racks
,
no
scaffolds
,
no
thumbscrews
,
no
pikes
,
no
pillories
,
"
said
Chollop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
rewolwers
and
bowie
-
knives
,
"
returned
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
Not
worth
mentioning
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
who
had
met
them
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
came
crawling
up
at
this
juncture
,
and
looked
in
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Chollop
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
YOU
git
along
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
considerable
difficulty
in
getting
along
at
all
,
and
said
as
much
in
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Co.
<EOS>
And
me
,
sir
,
"
observed
Chollop
,
"
are
disputating
a
piece
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
slicked
up
pretty
smart
to
disputate
between
the
Old
World
and
the
New
,
I
do
expect
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
returned
the
miserable
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
he
had
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
merely
observing
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
addressing
this
new
visitor
,
"
that
I
looked
upon
the
city
in
which
we
have
the
honour
to
live
,
as
being
swampy
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
sentiments
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
opinionate
it
's
moist
perhaps
,
at
certain
times
,
"
returned
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
not
as
moist
as
England
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Chollop
,
with
a
fierce
expression
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
Not
as
moist
as
England
;
let
alone
its
Institutions
,
"
said
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
there
ai
n't
a
swamp
in
all
Americay
,
as
do
n't
whip
THAT
small
island
into
mush
and
molasses
,
"
observed
Chollop
,
decisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
bought
slick
,
straight
,
and
right
away
,
of
Scadder
,
sir
?
"
to
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
He
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chollop
winked
at
the
other
citizen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Scadder
is
a
smart
man
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
rising
man
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
as
will
come
up'ards
,
<EOS>
right
side
up
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chollop
winked
again
at
the
other
citizen
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
should
have
his
right
side
very
high
up
,
if
I
had
my
way
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
high
up
as
the
top
of
a
good
tall
gallows
,
perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chollop
was
so
delighted
at
the
smartness
of
his
excellent
countryman
having
been
too
much
for
the
Britisher
,
and
at
the
Britisher
's
resenting
it
,
that
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
,
and
broke
forth
in
a
shout
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
strangest
exposition
of
this
ruling
passion
was
in
the
other
---
the
pestilence
-
stricken
,
broken
,
miserable
shadow
of
a
man
---
who
derived
so
much
entertainment
from
the
circumstance
that
he
seemed
to
forget
his
own
ruin
in
thinking
of
it
,
and
laughed
outright
when
he
said
"
that
Scadder
was
a
smart
man
,
and
had
draw'd
<EOS>
a
lot
of
British
capital
that
way
,
as
sure
as
sun
-
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
full
enjoyment
of
this
joke
,
Mr
Hannibal
Chollop
sat
smoking
and
improving
the
circle
,
without
making
any
attempts
either
to
converse
or
to
take
leave
;
apparently
labouring
under
the
not
uncommon
delusion
that
for
a
free
and
enlightened
citizen
of
the
United
States
to
convert
another
man
's
house
into
a
spittoon
for
two
or
three
hours
together
,
was
a
delicate
attention
,
full
of
interest
and
politeness
,
of
which
nobody
could
ever
tire
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
-
going
easy
,
"
he
observed
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
entreated
him
to
take
particular
care
of
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Afore
I
go
,
"
he
said
sternly
,
"
I
have
got
a
leetle
word
to
say
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
darnation
"
cute
,
you
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
thanked
him
for
the
compliment
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
much
too
"
cute
to
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
con
<EOS>
-
ceive
of
any
spotted
Painter
in
the
bush
,
as
ever
was
so
riddled
through
and
through
as
you
will
be
,
I
bet
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
"
asked
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
be
cracked
up
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Chollop
,
in
a
tone
of
menace
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
now
in
A
despotic
land
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
a
model
to
the
airth
,
and
must
be
jist
cracked
-
up
<EOS>
,
I
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
I
speak
too
free
,
do
I
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
draw'd
upon
A
man
,
and
fired
upon
A
man
for
less
,
"
said
Chollop
,
frowning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
know'd
strong
men
obleeged
to
make
themselves
uncommon
skase
for
less
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know'd
men
Lynched
for
less
,
and
beaten
into
punkin'-sarse
for
less
,
by
an
enlightened
people
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
the
intellect
and
virtue
of
the
airth
,
the
cream
of
human
natur
'
,
and
the
flower
Of
moral
force
.
 
<EOS>
Our
backs
is
easy
ris
.
<EOS>
We
must
be
cracked
-
up
,
or
they
rises
,
and
we
snarls
.
 
<EOS>
We
shows
our
teeth
,
I
tell
you
,
fierce
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
better
crack
us
up
,
you
had
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
the
delivery
of
this
caution
,
Mr
Chollop
departed
;
with
Ripper
,
Tickler
,
and
the
revolvers
,
all
ready
for
action
on
the
shortest
notice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
out
from
under
the
blanket
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
he
's
gone
.
<EOS>
What
's
this
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
softly
;
kneeling
down
to
look
into
his
partner
's
face
,
and
taking
his
hot
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
come
of
all
that
chattering
and
swaggering
?
 
<EOS>
He
's
wandering
in
his
mind
to
-
night
,
and
do
n't
know
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
indeed
was
dangerously
ill
;
very
near
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
in
that
state
many
days
,
during
which
time
Mark
's
poor
friends
,
regardless
of
themselves
,
attended
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
,
fatigued
in
mind
and
body
;
working
all
the
day
and
sitting
up
at
night
;
worn
with
hard
living
and
the
unaccustomed
toil
of
his
new
life
;
surrounded
by
dismal
and
discouraging
circumstances
of
every
kind
;
never
complained
or
yielded
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
he
had
thought
Martin
selfish
or
inconsiderate
,
or
had
deemed
him
energetic
only
by
fits
and
starts
,
and
then
too
passive
for
their
desperate
fortunes
,
he
now
forgot
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
remembered
nothing
but
the
better
qualities
of
his
fellow
-
wanderer
,
and
was
devoted
to
him
,
heart
and
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Many
weeks
elapsed
before
Martin
was
strong
enough
to
move
about
with
the
help
of
a
stick
and
Mark
's
arm
;
and
even
then
his
recovery
,
for
want
of
wholesome
air
and
proper
nourishment
,
was
very
slow
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
yet
in
a
feeble
and
weak
condition
,
when
the
misfourtune
he
had
so
much
dreaded
fell
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
was
taken
ill
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
fought
against
it
;
but
the
malady
fought
harder
,
and
his
efforts
were
in
vain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Floored
for
the
present
,
sir
,
"
he
said
one
morning
,
sinking
back
upon
his
bed
;
"
but
jolly
!
"
   
<EOS>
Floored
indeed
,
and
by
a
heavy
blow
!
 
<EOS>
As
any
one
<EOS>
but
Martin
might
have
known
beforehand
.
   
<EOS>
If
Mark
's
friends
had
been
kind
to
Martin
<EOS>
(
and
they
had
been
very
)
,
they
were
twenty
times
kinder
to
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
it
was
Martin
's
turn
to
work
,
and
sit
beside
the
bed
and
watch
,
and
listen
through
the
long
,
long
nights
,
to
every
sound
in
the
gloomy
wilderness
;
and
hear
poor
Mr
Tapley
,
in
his
wandering
fancy
,
playing
at
skittles
in
the
Dragon
,
making
love
-
remonstrances
to
Mrs
Lupin
,
getting
his
sea
-
legs
on
board
the
Screw
,
travelling
with
old
Tom
Pinch
on
English
roads
,
and
burning
stumps
of
trees
in
Eden
,
all
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
But
whenever
Martin
gave
him
drink
or
medicine
,
or
tended
him
in
any
way
,
or
came
into
the
house
returning
from
some
drudgery
without
,
the
patient
Mr
Tapley
brightened
up
and
cried
:
"
I
'm
jolly
,
sir
;
"
I
'm
jolly
!
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
when
Martin
began
to
think
of
this
,
and
to
look
at
Mark
as
he
lay
there
;
never
reproaching
him
by
so
much
as
an
expression
of
regret
;
never
murmuring
;
always
striving
to
be
manful
and
staunch
;
he
began
to
think
,
how
was
it
that
this
man
who
had
had
so
few
advantages
,
was
so
much
better
than
he
who
had
had
so
many
?
 
<EOS>
And
attendance
upon
a
sick
bed
,
but
especially
the
sick
bed
of
one
whom
we
have
been
accustomed
to
see
in
full
activity
and
vigour
,
<EOS>
being
a
great
breeder
of
reflection
,
he
began
to
ask
himself
in
what
they
differed
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
assisted
in
coming
to
a
conclusion
on
this
head
by
the
frequent
presence
of
Mark
's
friend
,
their
fellow
-
passenger
across
the
ocean
,
which
suggested
to
him
that
in
regard
to
having
aided
her
,
for
example
,
they
had
differed
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Somehow
he
coupled
Tom
Pinch
with
this
train
of
reflection
;
and
thinking
that
Tom
would
be
very
likely
to
have
struck
up
the
same
sort
of
acquaintance
under
similar
circumstances
,
began
to
think
in
what
respects
two
people
so
extremely
different
were
like
each
other
,
and
were
unlike
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
sight
there
was
nothing
very
distressing
in
these
meditations
,
but
they
did
undoubtedly
distress
him
for
all
that
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
's
nature
was
a
frank
and
generous
one
;
but
he
had
been
bred
up
in
his
grandfather
's
house
;
and
it
will
usually
be
found
that
the
meaner
domestic
vices
propagate
themselves
to
be
their
own
antagonists
.
 
<EOS>
Selfishness
does
this
especially
;
so
do
suspicion
,
cunning
,
stealth
,
and
covetous
propensities
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
had
unconsciously
reasoned
as
a
child
,
"
My
guardian
takes
so
much
thought
of
himself
,
that
unless
I
do
the
like
by
MYself
,
I
shall
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
he
had
grown
selfish
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
had
never
known
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
one
had
taxed
him
with
the
vice
,
he
would
have
indignantly
repelled
the
accusation
,
and
conceived
himself
unworthily
aspersed
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
would
have
known
it
,
but
that
being
newly
risen
from
a
bed
of
dangerous
sickness
,
to
watch
by
such
another
couch
,
he
felt
how
nearly
Self
had
dropped
into
the
grave
,
and
what
a
poor
dependent
,
miserable
thing
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
natural
for
him
to
reflect
---
he
had
months
to
do
it
in
---
upon
his
own
escape
,
and
Mark
's
extremity
.
 
<EOS>
This
led
him
to
consider
which
of
them
could
be
the
better
spared
,
and
why
?
 
<EOS>
Then
the
curtain
slowly
rose
a
very
little
way
;
and
Self
,
Self
,
Self
,
was
shown
below
.
   
<EOS>
He
asked
himself
,
besides
,
when
dreading
Mark
's
decease
(
as
all
men
do
and
must
,
at
such
a
time
)
,
whether
he
had
done
his
duty
by
him
,
and
had
deserved
and
made
a
good
response
to
his
fidelity
and
zeal
.
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Short
as
their
companionship
had
been
,
he
felt
in
many
,
many
instances
,
that
there
was
blame
against
himself
;
and
still
inquiring
why
,
the
curtain
slowly
rose
a
little
more
,
and
Self
,
Self
,
Self
,
dilated
on
the
scene
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
long
before
he
fixed
the
knowledge
of
himself
so
firmly
in
his
mind
that
he
could
thoroughly
discern
the
truth
;
but
in
the
hideous
solitude
of
that
most
hideous
place
,
with
Hope
so
far
removed
,
Ambition
quenched
,
and
Death
beside
him
rattling
at
the
very
door
,
reflection
came
,
as
in
a
plague
-
beleaguered
town
;
and
so
he
felt
and
knew
the
failing
of
his
life
,
and
saw
distinctly
what
an
ugly
spot
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
Eden
was
a
hard
school
to
learn
so
hard
a
lesson
in
;
but
there
were
teachers
in
the
swamp
and
thicket
,
and
the
pestilential
air
,
who
had
a
searching
method
of
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
He
made
a
solemn
resolution
that
when
his
strength
returned
he
would
not
dispute
the
point
or
resist
the
conviction
,
but
would
look
upon
it
as
an
established
fact
,
that
selfishness
was
in
his
breast
,
and
must
be
rooted
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
doubtful
(
and
with
justice
)
of
his
own
character
,
that
he
determined
not
to
say
one
word
of
vain
regret
or
good
resolve
to
Mark
,
but
steadily
to
keep
his
purpose
before
his
own
eyes
solely
;
and
there
was
not
a
jot
of
pride
in
this
;
nothing
but
humility
and
steadfastness
;
the
best
armour
he
could
wear
.
 
<EOS>
So
low
had
Eden
brought
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
So
high
had
Eden
raised
him
up
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
long
and
lingering
illness
(
in
certain
forlorn
stages
of
which
,
when
too
far
gone
to
speak
,
he
had
feebly
written
"
jolly
!
"
<EOS>
on
a
slate
)
,
Mark
showed
some
symptoms
of
returning
health
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
and
went
,
and
flickered
for
a
time
;
but
he
began
to
mend
at
last
decidedly
;
and
after
that
continued
to
improve
from
day
to
day
.
   
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
well
enough
to
talk
without
fatigue
,
Martin
consulted
him
upon
a
project
he
had
in
his
mind
,
and
which
a
few
months
back
he
would
have
carried
into
execution
without
troubling
anybody
's
head
but
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ours
is
a
desperate
case
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Plainly
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
is
deserted
;
its
failure
must
have
become
known
;
and
selling
what
we
have
bought
to
any
one
,
for
anything
,
is
hopeless
,
even
if
it
were
honest
.
 
<EOS>
We
left
home
on
a
mad
enterprise
,
and
have
failed
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
hope
left
us
,
the
only
one
end
for
which
we
have
now
to
try
,
is
to
quit
this
settlement
for
ever
,
and
get
back
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
Anyhow
!
<EOS>
by
any
means
!
<EOS>
only
to
get
back
there
,
Mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Tapley
,
with
a
significant
stress
upon
the
words
;
"
only
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
upon
this
side
of
the
water
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
we
have
<EOS>
but
one
friend
who
can
help
us
,
and
that
is
Mr
Bevan
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
of
him
when
you
was
ill
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
for
the
time
that
would
be
lost
,
I
would
even
write
to
my
grandfather
,
"
Martin
went
on
to
say
,
"
and
implore
him
for
money
to
free
us
from
this
trap
into
which
we
were
so
cruelly
decoyed
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
try
Mr
Bevan
first
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
very
pleasant
sort
of
a
gentleman
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
few
goods
we
brought
here
,
and
in
which
we
spent
our
money
,
would
produce
something
if
sold
,
"
resumed
Martin
;
"
and
whatever
they
realise
shall
be
paid
him
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
ca
n't
be
sold
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
nobody
but
corpses
to
buy
'
em
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
rueful
air
,
"
and
pigs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
him
so
,
and
only
ask
him
for
money
enough
to
enable
us
by
the
cheapest
means
to
reach
New
York
,
or
any
port
from
which
we
may
hope
to
get
a
passage
home
,
by
serving
in
any
capacity
?
<EOS>
Explaining
to
him
at
the
same
time
how
I
am
connected
,
and
that
I
will
endeavour
to
repay
him
,
even
through
my
grandfather
,
immediately
on
our
arrival
in
England
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Mark
:
"
<EOS>
he
can
only
say
no
,
and
he
may
say
yes
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
mind
trying
him
,
sir
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Mind
!
"
exclaimed
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
blame
for
coming
here
,
and
I
would
do
anything
to
get
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
think
of
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
taken
your
opinion
sooner
,
Mark
,
we
never
should
have
been
here
,
I
am
certain
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
was
very
much
surprised
at
this
admission
,
but
protested
,
with
great
vehemence
,
that
they
would
have
been
there
all
the
same
;
and
that
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
coming
to
Eden
,
from
the
first
word
he
had
ever
heard
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
then
read
him
a
letter
to
Mr
Bevan
,
which
he
had
already
prepared
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
frankly
and
ingenuously
written
,
and
described
their
situation
without
the
least
concealment
;
plainly
stated
the
miseries
they
had
undergone
;
and
preferred
their
request
in
modest
but
straightforward
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
highly
commended
it
;
and
they
determined
to
dispatch
it
by
the
next
steamboat
going
the
right
way
,
that
might
call
to
take
in
wood
at
Eden
---
where
there
was
plenty
of
wood
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
Not
knowing
how
to
address
Mr
Bevan
at
his
own
place
of
abode
,
Martin
superscribed
it
to
the
care
of
the
memorable
Mr
Norris
of
New
York
,
and
wrote
upon
the
cover
an
entreaty
that
it
might
be
forwarded
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
More
than
a
week
elapsed
before
a
boat
appeared
;
but
at
length
they
were
awakened
very
early
one
morning
by
the
high
-
pressure
snorting
of
the
"
Esau
Slodge
;
"
named
after
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
the
country
,
who
had
been
very
eminent
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrying
down
to
the
landing
-
place
,
they
got
it
safe
on
board
;
and
waiting
anxiously
to
see
the
boat
depart
,
stopped
up
the
gangway
;
an
instance
of
neglect
which
caused
the
"
Capting
"
of
the
Esau
Slodge
to
"
wish
he
might
be
sifted
fine
as
flour
,
and
whittled
small
as
chips
;
that
if
they
did
n't
come
off
<EOS>
that
there
fixing
right
smart
too
,
he
'd
spill
'em
in
the
drink
;
"
whereby
the
Capting
metaphorically
said
he
'd
throw
them
in
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
not
likely
to
receive
an
answer
for
eight
or
ten
weeks
at
the
earliest
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
they
devoted
such
strength
as
they
had
to
the
attempted
improvement
of
their
land
;
to
clearing
some
of
it
,
and
preparing
it
for
useful
purposes
.
 
<EOS>
Monstrously
defective
<EOS>
as
their
farming
was
,
still
it
was
better
than
their
neighbours
'
;
for
Mark
had
some
practical
knowledge
of
such
matters
,
and
Martin
learned
of
him
;
whereas
the
other
settlers
who
remained
upon
the
putrid
swamp
(
a
mere
handful
,
and
those
withered
by
disease
)
,
appeared
to
have
wandered
there
with
the
idea
that
husbandry
was
the
natural
gift
of
all
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
They
helped
each
other
after
their
own
manner
in
these
struggles
,
and
in
all
others
;
but
they
worked
as
hopelessly
and
sadly
as
a
gang
of
convicts
in
a
penal
settlement
.
   
<EOS>
Often
at
night
when
Mark
and
Martin
were
alone
,
and
lying
down
to
sleep
,
they
spoke
of
home
,
familiar
places
,
houses
,
roads
,
and
people
whom
they
knew
;
sometimes
in
the
lively
hope
of
seeing
them
again
,
and
sometimes
with
a
sorrowful
tranquillity
,
as
if
that
hope
were
dead
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
source
of
great
amazement
to
Mark
Tapley
to
find
,
pervading
all
these
conversations
,
a
singular
alteration
in
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
make
of
him
,
"
he
thought
one
night
,
"
he
ai
n't
what
I
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
n't
think
of
himself
half
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
Asleep
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mark
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thinking
of
home
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
was
I
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
wondering
how
Mr
Pinch
and
Mr
Pecksniff
gets
on
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
Tom
!
"
said
Martin
,
thoughtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Weak
-
minded
man
,
sir
,
"
observed
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Plays
the
organ
for
nothing
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Takes
no
care
of
himself
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
took
a
little
more
,
indeed
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Though
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
n't
like
him
half
as
well

perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
gets
put
upon
,
sir
,
"
hinted
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
"
said
Martin
,
after
a
short
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
Mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
so
regretfully
that
his
partner
abandoned
the
theme
,
and
was
silent
for
a
short
time
until
he
had
thought
of
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
!
"
said
Mark
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
've
ventured
a
good
deal
for
a
young
lady
's
love
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
so
sure
of
that
<EOS>
,
Mark
,
"
was
the
reply
;
so
hastily
and
energetically
spoken
,
that
Martin
sat
up
in
his
bed
to
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
be
far
from
clear
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
it
<EOS>
she
is
very
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
sacrificed
her
peace
of
mind
;
she
has
endangered
her
interests
very
much
;
she
ca
n't
run
away
from
those
who
are
jealous
of
her
,
and
opposed
to
her
,
as
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
She
has
to
endure
,
Mark
;
to
endure
without
the
possibility
of
action
,
poor
girl
!
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
that
she
has
more
to
bear
than
ever
I
had
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
opened
his
eyes
wide
in
the
dark
;
but
did
not
interrupt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'll
tell
you
a
secret
,
Mark
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
since
we
ARE
upon
this
subject
.
 
<EOS>
That
ring
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Which
ring
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
Mark
inquired
,
opening
his
eyes
still
wider
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
ring
she
gave
me
when
we
parted
,
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
She
bought
it
;
bought
it
;
knowing
I
was
poor
and
proud
<EOS>
(
Heaven
help
me
!
 
<EOS>
Proud
!
)
and
wanted
money
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
says
so
,
sir
?
"
asked
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
it
,
my
good
fellow
,
hundreds
of
times
,
while
you
were
lying
ill
.
 
<EOS>
And
like
a
beast
,
I
took
it
from
her
hand
,
and
wore
it
on
my
own
,
and
never
dreamed
of
this
even
at
the
moment
when
I
parted
with
it
,
when
some
faint
glimmering
of
the
truth
might
surely
have
possessed
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
late
,
"
said
Martin
,
checking
himself
,
"
and
you
are
weak
and
tired
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
only
talk
to
cheer
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Mark
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
reg'larly
defrauded
,
"
thought
Mr
Tapley
,
turning
round
with
a
happy
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
swindle
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
entered
for
this
sort
of
service
.
 
<EOS>
There
'll
be
no
credit
in
being
jolly
with
HIM
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
time
wore
on
,
and
other
steamboats
coming
from
the
point
on
which
their
hopes
were
fixed
,
arrived
to
take
in
wood
;
but
still
no
answer
to
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Rain
,
heat
,
foul
slime
,
and
noxious
vapour
,
with
all
the
ills
and
filthy
things
they
bred
,
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
The
earth
,
the
air
,
the
vegetation
,
and
the
water
that
they
drank
,
all
teemed
with
deadly
properties
.
 
<EOS>
Their
fellow
-
passenger
had
lost
two
children
long
before
;
and
buried
now
her
last
.
 
<EOS>
Such
things
are
much
too
common
to
be
widely
known
or
cared
for
.
 
<EOS>
Smart
citizens
grow
rich
,
and
friendless
victims
smart
and
die
,
and
are
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
all
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
a
boat
came
panting
up
the
ugly
river
,
and
stopped
at
Eden
.
<EOS>
Mark
was
waiting
at
the
wood
hut
when
it
came
,
and
had
a
letter
handed
to
him
from
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
He
bore
it
off
to
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
at
one
another
,
trembling
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
feels
heavy
,
"
faltered
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
And
opening
it
a
little
roll
of
dollar
-
notes
fell
out
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
What
either
of
them
said
,
or
did
,
or
felt
,
at
first
,
neither
of
them
knew
.
 
<EOS>
All
Mark
could
ever
tell
was
,
that
he
was
at
the
river
's
bank
again
out
of
breath
,
before
the
boat
had
gone
,
inquiring
when
it
would
retrace
its
track
and
put
in
there
.
   
<EOS>
The
answer
was
,
in
ten
or
twelve
days
;
notwithstanding
which
they
began
to
get
their
goods
together
and
to
tie
them
up
that
very
night
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
stage
of
excitement
was
passed
,
each
of
them
believed
(
they
found
this
out
,
in
talking
of
it
afterwards
)
that
he
would
surely
die
before
the
boat
returned
.
   
<EOS>
They
lived
,
however
,
and
it
came
,
after
the
lapse
of
three
long
crawling
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
At
sunrise
,
on
an
autumn
day
,
they
stood
upon
her
deck
.
   
<EOS>
"
Courage
!
 
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
waving
his
hand
to
two
thin
figures
on
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
Old
World
!
"
   
"
Or
in
the
next
one
,
"
added
Mark
below
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
see
them
standing
side
by
side
,
so
quiet
,
is
a'most
the
worst
of
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
looked
at
one
another
as
the
vessel
moved
away
,
and
then
looked
backward
at
the
spot
from
which
it
hurried
fast
.
 
<EOS>
The
log
-
house
,
with
the
open
door
,
and
drooping
trees
about
it
;
the
stagnant
morning
mist
,
and
red
sun
<EOS>
,
dimly
seen
beyond
;
the
vapour
rising
up
from
land
and
river
;
the
quick
stream
making
the
loathsome
banks
it
washed
more
flat
and
dull
;
how
often
they
returned
in
dreams
!
 
<EOS>
How
often
it
was
happiness
to
wake
and
find
them
Shadows
that
had
vanished
!

Chapter
34
.
<EOS>
In
which
the
travellers
move
homeward
,
and
encounter
some
distinguished
characters
upon
the
way
 
Among
the
passengers
on
board
the
steamboat
,
there
was
a
faint
gentleman
sitting
on
a
low
camp
-
stool
,
with
his
legs
on
a
high
barrel
of
flour
,
as
if
he
were
looking
at
the
prospect
with
his
ankles
,
who
attracted
their
attention
speedily
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
straight
black
hair
,
parted
up
the
middle
of
his
head
and
hanging
down
upon
his
coat
;
a
little
fringe
of
hair
upon
his
chin
;
wore
no
neckcloth
;
a
white
hat
;
a
suit
of
black
,
long
in
the
sleeves
and
short
in
the
legs
;
soiled
brown
stockings
and
laced
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
His
complexion
,
naturally
muddy
,
was
rendered
muddier
by
too
strict
an
economy
of
soap
and
water
;
and
the
same
observation
will
apply
to
the
washable
part
of
his
attire
,
which
he
might
have
changed
with
comfort
to
himself
and
gratification
to
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
about
five
and
thirty
;
was
crushed
and
jammed
up
in
a
heap
,
under
the
shade
of
a
large
green
cotton
umbrella
;
and
ruminated
over
his
tobacco
-
plug
like
a
cow
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
not
singular
,
to
be
sure
,
in
these
respects
;
for
every
gentleman
on
board
appeared
to
have
had
a
difference
with
his
laundress
and
to
have
left
off
washing
himself
in
early
youth
.
<EOS>
Every
gentleman
,
too
,
was
perfectly
stopped
up
with
tight
plugging
,
and
was
dislocated
in
the
greater
part
of
his
joints
.
 
<EOS>
But
about
this
gentleman
there
was
a
peculiar
air
of
sagacity
and
wisdom
,
which
convinced
Martin
that
he
was
no
common
character
;
and
this
turned
out
to
be
the
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
sir
?
"
said
a
voice
in
Martin
's
ear
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
sir
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
tall
thin
gentleman
who
spoke
to
him
,
with
a
carpet
-
cap
on
,
and
a
long
loose
coat
of
green
baize
,
ornamented
about
the
pockets
with
black
velvet
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
air
from
Europe
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
air
fortunate
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
thought
so
too
;
but
he
soon
discovered
that
the
gentleman
and
he
attached
different
meanings
to
this
remark
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
air
fortunate
,
sir
,
in
having
an
opportunity
of
beholding
our
Elijah
Pogram
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
Elijahpogram
!
"
said
Martin
,
thinking
it
was
all
one
word
,
and
a
building
of
some
sort
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
tried
to
look
as
if
he
understood
him
,
but
he
could
n't
make
it
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
repeated
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
our
Elijah
Pogram
,
sir
,
is
,
at
this
minute
,
identically
settin
'
by
the
en
-
gine
biler
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
under
the
umbrella
put
his
right
forefinger
to
his
eyebrow
,
as
if
he
were
revolving
schemes
of
state
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
Elijah
Pogram
,
is
it
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
Elijah
Pogram
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
astonished
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
the
least
idea
who
this
Elijah
Pogram
was
<EOS>
;
having
never
heard
the
name
in
all
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
the
biler
of
this
vessel
was
Toe
bust
,
sir
,
"
said
his
new
acquaintance
,
"
and
<EOS>
Toe
bust
now
,
this
would
be
a
festival
day
in
the
calendar
of
despotism
;
pretty
nigh
equallin
'
,
sir
,
in
its
effects
upon
the
human
race
,
our
Fourth
of
glorious
July
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
that
is
the
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
,
Member
of
Congress
;
one
of
the
master
-
minds
of
our
country
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
brow
,
sir
,
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
remarkable
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Our
own
immortal
Chiggle
,
sir
,
is
said
to
have
observed
,
when
he
made
the
celebrated
Pogram
statter
in
marble
,
which
rose
so
much
con
-
test
and
preju
-
dice
in
Europe
,
that
the
brow
was
more
than
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
before
the
Pogram
Defiance
,
and
was
,
therefore
,
a
pre
-
diction
,
cruel
smart
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
Pogram
Defiance
?
"
asked
Martin
,
thinking
,
perhaps
<EOS>
,
it
was
the
sign
of
a
public
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
An
o
-
ration
,
sir
,
"
returned
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
to
be
sure
,
"
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
thinking
of
!
 
<EOS>
It
defied
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
It
defied
the
world
,
sir
,
"
said
the
other
,
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Defied
the
world
in
general
to
com
-
pete
with
our
country
upon
any
hook
;
and
devellop'd
<EOS>
our
internal
resources
for
making
war
upon
the
universal
airth
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
like
to
know
Elijah
Pogram
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pogram
,
"
said
the
stranger
---
<EOS>
Mr
Pogram
having
overheard
every
word
of
the
dialogue
---
"
this
is
a
gentleman
from
Europe
,
sir
;
from
England
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
gen'rous
ene
-
mies
may
meet
upon
the
neutral
sile
of
private
life
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
languid
Mr
Pogram
shook
hands
with
Martin
,
like
a
clock
-
work
figure
that
was
just
running
down
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
made
amends
by
chewing
like
one
that
was
just
wound
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pogram
,
"
said
the
introducer
,
"
is
a
public
servant
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
When
Congress
is
recessed
,
he
makes
himself
acquainted
with
those
free
United
States
,
of
which
he
is
the
gifted
son
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
Martin
that
if
the
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
had
stayed
at
home
,
and
sent
his
shoes
upon
a
tour
,
they
would
have
answered
the
same
purpose
;
for
they
were
the
only
part
of
him
in
a
situation
to
see
anything
.
   
<EOS>
In
course
of
time
,
however
,
Mr
Pogram
rose
;
and
having
ejected
certain
plugging
consequences
which
would
have
impeded
his
articulation
,
took
up
a
position
where
there
was
something
to
lean
against
,
and
began
to
talk
to
Martin
;
shading
himself
with
the
green
umbrella
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
began
with
the
words
,
"
How
do
you
like
---
?
"
 
<EOS>
Martin
took
him
up
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
The
country
,
I
presume
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Elijah
Pogram
.
 
<EOS>
A
knot
of
passengers
gathered
round
to
hear
what
followed
;
and
Martin
heard
his
friend
say
,
as
he
whispered
to
another
friend
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
,
"
Pogram
will
smash
him
into
sky
-
blue
fits
,
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Martin
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
I
have
learned
by
experience
,
that
you
take
an
unfair
advantage
of
a
stranger
,
when
you
ask
that
question
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mean
it
to
be
answered
,
except
in
one
way
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
do
n't
choose
to
answer
it
in
that
way
,
for
I
can
not
honestly
answer
it
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
I
would
rather
not
answer
it
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pogram
was
going
to
make
a
great
speech
in
the
next
session
about
foreign
relations
,
and
was
going
to
write
strong
articles
on
the
subject
;
and
as
he
greatly
favoured
the
free
and
independent
custom
(
a
very
harmless
and
agreeable
one
)
of
procuring
information
of
any
sort
in
any
kind
of
confidence
,
and
afterwards
perverting
it
publicly
in
any
manner
that
happened
to
suit
him
,
he
had
determined
to
get
at
Martin
's
opinions
somehow
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
he
could
have
got
nothing
out
of
him
,
he
would
have
had
to
invent
it
for
him
,
and
that
would
have
been
laborious
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
mental
note
of
his
answer
,
and
went
in
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
from
Eden
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
How
did
you
like
Eden
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
said
what
he
thought
of
that
part
of
the
country
,
in
pretty
strong
terms
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
,
"
said
Pogram
,
looking
round
upon
the
group
,
"
this
hatred
of
our
country
,
and
her
Institutions
!
 
<EOS>
This
national
antipathy
is
deeply
rooted
in
the
British
mind
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
,
sir
,
"
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
Eden
Land
Corporation
,
with
Mr
Scadder
at
its
head
,
and
all
the
misery
it
has
worked
,
at
its
door
,
an
Institution
of
America
?
 
<EOS>
A
part
of
any
form
of
government
that
ever
was
known
or
heard
of
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
con
-
sider
the
cause
of
this
to
be
,
"
said
Pogram
,
looking
round
again
and
taking
himself
up
where
Martin
had
interrupted
him
,
"
<EOS>
partly
jealousy
and
pre
-
judice
,
and
partly
the
nat'ral
unfitness
of
the
British
people
to
appreciate
the
ex
-
alted
Institutions
of
our
native
land
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
,
sir
,
"
turning
to
Martin
again
,
"
that
a
gentleman
named
Chollop
happened
in
upon
you
during
your
lo
-
cation
in
the
town
of
Eden
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
answered
Martin
;
"
but
my
friend
can
answer
this
better
than
I
can
,
for
I
was
very
ill
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
!
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
is
speaking
of
Mr
Chollop
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
,
"
observed
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
splendid
example
of
our
na
-
tive
raw
material
,
sir
?
"
said
Pogram
,
interrogatively
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
!
"
cried
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
The
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
glanced
at
his
friends
as
though
he
would
have
said
,
"
Observe
this
!
 
<EOS>
See
what
follows
!
"
<EOS>
and
they
rendered
tribute
to
the
Pogram
genius
by
a
gentle
murmur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
fellow
-
countryman
is
a
model
of
a
man
,
quite
fresh
from
Natur
's
mould
!
<EOS>
"
said
Pogram
,
with
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
true
-
born
child
of
this
free
hemisphere
!
 
<EOS>
Verdant
as
the
mountains
of
our
country
;
bright
and
flowing
as
our
mineral
Licks
;
unspiled
by
withering
conventionalities
as
air
our
broad
and
boundless
Perearers
!
 
<EOS>
Rough
he
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
So
air
our
Barrs
.
 
<EOS>
Wild
he
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
So
air
our
Buffalers
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
a
child
of
Natur
'
,
and
a
child
of
Freedom
;
and
his
boastful
answer
to
the
Despot
and
the
Tyrant
is
,
that
his
bright
home
is
in
the
Settin
Sun
.
"
   
<EOS>
Part
of
this
referred
to
Chollop
,
and
part
to
a
Western
postmaster
,
who
,
being
a
public
defaulter
not
very
long
before
(
a
character
not
at
all
uncommon
in
America
)
,
had
been
removed
from
office
;
and
on
whose
behalf
Mr
Pogram
(
he
voted
for
Pogram
)
had
thundered
the
last
sentence
from
his
seat
in
Congress
,
at
the
head
of
an
unpopular
President
.
 
<EOS>
It
told
brilliantly
;
for
the
bystanders
were
delighted
,
and
one
of
them
said
to
Martin
,
"
that
he
guessed
he
had
now
seen
something
of
the
eloquential
aspect
of
our
country
,
and
was
chawed
up
pritty
small
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pogram
waited
until
his
hearers
were
calm
again
,
before
he
said
to
Mark
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
seem
to
coincide
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
I
did
n't
like
him
much
;
and
that
's
the
truth
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
a
bully
;
and
I
did
n't
admire
his
carryin
'
them
murderous
little
persuaders
,
and
being
so
ready
to
use
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
singler
!
"
said
Pogram
,
lifting
his
umbrella
high
enough
to
look
all
round
from
under
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
strange
!
 
<EOS>
You
observe
the
settled
opposition
to
our
Institutions
which
pervades
the
British
mind
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
extraordinary
people
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
Mr
Chollop
and
the
class
he
represents
,
an
Institution
here
?
 
<EOS>
Are
pistols
with
revolving
barrels
,
sword
-
sticks
,
bowie
-
knives
,
and
such
things
,
Institutions
on
which
you
pride
yourselves
?
 
<EOS>
Are
bloody
duels
,
brutal
combats
,
savage
assaults
,
shooting
down
and
stabbing
in
the
streets
,
your
Institutions
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
shall
hear
next
that
Dishonour
and
Fraud
are
among
the
Institutions
of
the
great
republic
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
moment
the
words
passed
his
lips
,
the
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
looked
round
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
morbid
hatred
of
our
Institutions
,
"
he
observed
,
"
is
quite
a
study
for
the
psychological
observer
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
alludin
'
to
Repudiation
now
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
may
make
anything
an
Institution
if
you
like
,
"
said
Martin
,
laughing
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
confess
you
had
me
there
,
for
you
certainly
have
made
that
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
greater
part
of
these
things
are
one
Institution
with
us
,
and
we
call
it
by
the
generic
name
of
Old
Bailey
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
bell
being
rung
for
dinner
at
this
moment
,
everybody
ran
away
into
the
cabin
,
whither
the
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
fled
with
such
precipitation
that
he
forgot
his
umbrella
was
up
,
and
fixed
it
so
tightly
in
the
cabin
door
that
it
could
neither
be
let
down
nor
got
out
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
so
this
accident
created
a
perfect
rebellion
among
the
hungry
passengers
behind
,
who
,
seeing
the
dishes
,
and
hearing
the
knives
and
forks
at
work
,
well
knew
what
would
happen
unless
they
got
there
instantly
,
and
were
nearly
mad
;
while
several
virtuous
citizens
at
the
table
were
in
deadly
peril
of
choking
themselves
in
their
unnatural
efforts
to
get
rid
of
all
the
meat
before
these
others
came
.
   
<EOS>
They
carried
the
umbrella
by
storm
,
however
,
and
rushed
in
at
the
breach
.
 
<EOS>
The
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
and
Martin
found
themselves
,
after
a
severe
struggle
,
side
by
side
,
as
they
might
have
come
together
in
the
pit
of
a
London
theatre
;
and
for
four
whole
minutes
afterwards
,
Pogram
was
snapping
up
great
blocks
of
everything
he
could
get
hold
of
,
like
a
raven
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
taken
this
unusually
protracted
dinner
,
he
began
to
talk
to
Martin
;
and
begged
him
not
to
have
the
least
delicacy
in
speaking
with
perfect
freedom
to
him
,
for
he
was
a
calm
philosopher
.
 
<EOS>
Which
Martin
was
extremely
glad
to
hear
;
for
he
had
begun
to
speculate
on
Elijah
being
a
disciple
of
that
other
school
of
republican
philosophy
,
whose
noble
sentiments
are
carved
with
knives
upon
a
pupil
's
body
,
and
written
,
not
with
pen
and
ink
,
but
tar
and
feathers
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
my
countrymen
who
are
present
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Elijah
Pogram
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
very
pleasant
,
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
a
very
pleasant
party
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
had
spoken
a
word
;
every
one
had
been
intent
,
as
usual
,
on
his
own
private
gorging
;
and
the
greater
part
of
the
company
were
decidedly
dirty
feeders
.
   
<EOS>
The
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
looked
at
Martin
as
if
he
thought
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
,
I
know
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
was
soon
confirmed
in
this
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
Sitting
opposite
to
them
was
a
gentleman
in
a
high
state
of
tobacco
,
who
wore
quite
a
little
beard
,
composed
of
the
overflowing
of
that
weed
,
as
they
had
dried
about
his
mouth
and
chin
<EOS>
;
so
common
an
ornament
that
it
would
scarcely
have
attracted
Martin
's
observation
,
but
that
this
good
citizen
,
burning
to
assert
his
equality
against
all
comers
,
sucked
his
knife
for
some
moments
,
and
made
a
cut
with
it
at
the
butter
,
just
as
Martin
was
in
the
act
of
taking
some
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
juiciness
about
the
deed
that
might
have
sickened
a
scavenger
.
   
<EOS>
When
Elijah
Pogram
(
to
whom
this
was
an
every
-
day
incident
)
saw
that
Martin
put
the
plate
away
,
and
took
no
butter
,
he
was
quite
delighted
,
and
said
,
   
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
The
morbid
hatred
of
you
British
to
the
Institutions
of
our
country
is
as
-
TONishing
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
!
"
cried
Martin
,
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
most
wonderful
community
that
ever
existed
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
deliberately
makes
a
hog
of
himself
,
and
THAT
'S
an
Institution
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
time
to
ac
-
quire
forms
,
sir
,
"
said
Elijah
Pogram
.
   
<EOS>
"
Acquire
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
not
a
question
of
acquiring
anything
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
question
of
losing
the
natural
politeness
of
a
savage
,
and
that
instinctive
good
breeding
which
admonishes
one
man
not
to
offend
and
disgust
another
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
that
man
over
the
way
,
for
instance
,
naturally
knows
better
,
but
considers
it
a
very
fine
and
independent
thing
to
be
a
brute
in
small
matters
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
na
-
tive
of
our
country
,
and
is
nat'rally
bright
and
spry
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mr
Pogram
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
observe
what
this
comes
to
,
Mr
Pogram
,
"
pursued
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
mass
of
your
countrymen
begin
by
stubbornly
neglecting
little
social
observances
,
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
gentility
,
custom
,
usage
,
government
,
or
country
,
but
are
acts
of
common
,
decent
,
natural
,
human
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
You
abet
them
in
this
,
by
resenting
all
attacks
upon
their
social
offences
as
if
they
were
a
beautiful
national
feature
.
 
<EOS>
From
disregarding
small
obligations
they
come
in
regular
course
to
disregard
great
ones
;
and
so
refuse
to
pay
their
debts
.
<EOS>
What
they
may
do
,
or
what
they
may
refuse
to
do
next
,
I
do
n't
know
;
but
any
man
may
see
if
he
will
,
that
it
will
be
something
following
in
natural
succession
,
and
a
part
of
one
great
growth
,
which
is
rotten
at
the
root
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
mind
of
Mr
Pogram
was
too
philosophical
to
see
this
;
so
they
went
on
deck
again
,
<EOS>
where
,
resuming
his
former
post
,
he
chewed
until
he
was
in
a
lethargic
state
,
amounting
to
insensibility
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
weary
voyage
of
several
days
,
they
came
again
to
that
same
wharf
where
Mark
had
been
so
nearly
left
behind
,
on
the
night
of
starting
for
Eden
.
 
<EOS>
Captain
Kedgick
,
the
landlord
,
was
standing
there
,
and
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
them
coming
from
the
boat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
"
tarnal
!
"
cried
the
Captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
admire
at
this
,
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
can
stay
at
your
house
until
to
-
morrow
,
Captain
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
reckon
you
can
stay
there
for
a
twelvemonth
if
you
like
,
"
retorted
Kedgick
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
our
people
wo
n't
best
like
your
coming
back
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
like
it
,
Captain
Kedgick
!
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
did
ex
-
pect
<EOS>
you
was
a
-
going
to
settle
,
"
Kedgick
answered
,
as
he
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
've
been
took
in
,
you
ca
n't
deny
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
cried
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
ought
to
have
received
'
em
,
"
said
the
Captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
you
did
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
friend
,
"
returned
Martin
,
"
did
I
want
to
receive
them
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
any
act
of
mine
?
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
tell
me
they
would
rile
up
,
and
that
I
should
be
flayed
like
a
wild
cat
---
and
threaten
all
kinds
of
vengeance
,
if
I
did
n't
receive
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
"
returned
the
Captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
when
our
people
's
frills
is
out
,
they
're
starched
up
pretty
stiff
,
I
tell
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
fell
into
the
rear
to
walk
with
Mark
,
while
Martin
and
Elijah
Pogram
went
on
to
the
National
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
've
come
back
alive
,
you
see
!
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
the
thing
I
did
expect
,
"
the
Captain
grumbled
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
man
ai
n't
got
no
right
to
be
a
public
man
,
unless
he
meets
the
public
views
.
 
<EOS>
Our
fashionable
people
would
n't
have
attended
his
le

vee
,
if
they
had
know'd
it

Nothing
mollified
the
Captain
,
who
persisted
in
taking
it
very
ill
that
they
had
not
both
died
in
Eden
.
 
<EOS>
The
boarders
at
the
National
felt
strongly
on
the
subject
too
;
but
it
happened
by
good
fortune
that
they
had
not
much
time
to
think
about
this
grievance
,
for
it
was
suddenly
determined
to
pounce
upon
the
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
,
and
give
HIM
a
le
-
vee
forthwith
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
general
evening
meal
of
the
house
was
over
before
the
arrival
of
the
boat
,
Martin
,
Mark
,
and
Pogram
were
taking
tea
and
fixings
at
the
public
table
by
themselves
,
when
the
deputation
entered
to
announce
this
honour
;
consisting
of
six
gentlemen
boarders
and
a
very
shrill
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
said
the
spokesman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pogram
!
"
cried
the
shrill
boy
.
   
<EOS>
The
spokesman
thus
reminded
of
the
shrill
boy
's
presence
,
introduced
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Ginery
Dunkle

A

Excuse

Mr

<EOS>
My

"
   
<EOS>
Each
man
took
one
slide
forward
as
he
was
named
;
butted
at
the
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
with
his
head
;
shook
hands
,
and
slid
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
introductions
being
completed
,
the
spokesman
resumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pogram
!
"
cried
the
shrill
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
the
spokesman
,
with
a
hopeless
look
,
"
you
will
be
so
good
,
Dr.
Ginery
Dunkle
,
as
to
charge
yourself
with
the
execution
of
our
little
office
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
there
was
nothing
the
shrill
boy
desired
more
,
he
immediately
stepped
forward
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pogram
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
A
handful
of
your
fellow

,
sir

hearing
of
your
arrival
at
the
National
Hotel
,
and
feeling
the
patriotic
character
of
your
public
services
,
wish
,
sir
,
to
have
the
gratification
of
beholding
you
,
and
mixing
with
you

sir

and
unbending
with
you
,

in
those
moments
which

Air

suggested
Buffum
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
air
so
peculiarly
the
lot
,
sir

of
our
great
and
happy
country
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hear

<EOS>
cried
Colonel

,
in
a
loud
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good

<EOS>
Hear
him

<EOS>
Good
!
"
   
<EOS>

And
therefore
,

pursued
the
Doctor
,
"
they
request
;
as
A
mark
Of
their

the
honour
of
your

,
sir

in
the

,
at
eight
o'clock

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pogram
bowed
,
and
said
:
   
"
Fellow
countrymen
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
cried
the
Colonel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear

him

<EOS>
Good
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pogram
bowed
to
the
Colonel
individually
,
and
then
resumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
approbation
of
My
labours
in
the

goes
to
My

in

Battle

---
"
   
"
Good
,
very
good
!
 
<EOS>
Hear
him
!
 
<EOS>
Hear
him

"
said
the
Colonel
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
name
of
Pogram
will
be
proud
to
jine
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
may
it
,
My
friends
,
be
written
on
My
tomb
,
"
<EOS>
He
was
a
member
of
the
Congress
of
our
common
country
,
and
was
ac

Tive
in
his
trust
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
The
Com
-
mittee
,
sir
,
"
said
the
shrill
boy
,
"
will
wait
upon
you
at
five
minutes
afore
eight
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
My
leave
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pogram
shook
hands
with
him
,
and
everybody
else
,
once
more
;
and
when
they
came
back
again
at
five
minutes
before
eight
,
they
said
,
one
by
one
,
in
a
melancholy
voice
,
"
How
do
you
do
,
sir
?
"
and
shook
hands
with
Mr
Pogram
all
over
again
,
as
if
he
had
been
abroad
for
a
twelvemonth
in
the
meantime
,
and
they
met
,
now
,
at
a
funeral
.
   
<EOS>
But
by
this
time
Mr
Pogram
had
freshened
himself
up
,
and
had
composed
his
hair
and
features
after
the
Pogram
statue
,
so
that
any
one
with
half
an
eye
might
cry
out
,
"
There
he
is
!
<EOS>
as
he
delivered
the
Defiance
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
Committee
were
embellished
also
;
and
when
they
entered
the
ladies
'
ordinary
in
a
body
,
there
was
much
clapping
of
hands
from
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
accompanied
by
cries
of
"
Pogram
!
Pogram
!
"
<EOS>
and
some
standing
up
on
chairs
to
see
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
object
of
the
popular
caress
looked
round
the
room
as
he
walked
up
it
,
and
smiled
;
at
the
same
time
observing
to
the
shrill
boy
,
that
he
knew
something
of
the
beauty
of
the
daughters
of
their
common
country
,
but
had
never
seen
it
in
such
lustre
and
perfection
as
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Which
the
shrill
boy
put
in
the
paper
next
day
;
to
Elijah
Pogram
's
great
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
re
-
quest
you
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Buffum
,
laying
hands
on
Mr
Pogram
as
if
he
were
taking
his
measure
for
a
coat
,
"
to
stand
up
with
your
back
agin
the
wall
right
in
the
furthest
corner
,
that
there
may
be
more
room
for
our
fellow
cit
-
izens
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
could
set
your
back
right
slap
agin
that
curtain
-
peg
,
sir
,
keeping
your
left
leg
everlastingly
behind
the
stove
,
we
should
be
fixed
quite
slick
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pogram
did
as
he
was
told
,
and
wedged
himself
into
such
a
little
corner
that
the
Pogram
statue
would
n't
have
known
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
entertainments
of
the
evening
then
began
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
brought
ladies
up
,
and
brought
themselves
up
,
and
brought
each
other
up
;
and
asked
Elijah
Pogram
what
he
thought
of
this
political
question
,
and
what
he
thought
of
that
;
and
looked
at
him
,
and
looked
at
one
another
,
and
seemed
very
unhappy
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
on
the
chairs
looked
at
Elijah
Pogram
through
their
glasses
,
and
said
audibly
,
"
I
wish
he
'd
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
he
speak
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
ask
him
to
speak
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
Elijah
Pogram
looked
sometimes
at
the
ladies
and
sometimes
elsewhere
,
delivering
senatorial
opinions
,
as
he
was
asked
for
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
great
end
and
object
of
the
meeting
seemed
to
be
,
not
to
let
Elijah
Pogram
out
of
the
corner
on
any
account
;
so
there
they
kept
him
,
hard
and
fast
.
   
<EOS>
A
great
bustle
at
the
door
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
announced
the
arrival
of
some
remarkable
person
;
and
immediately
afterwards
an
elderly
gentleman
,
much
excited
,
was
seen
to
precipitate
himself
upon
the
crowd
,
and
battle
his
way
towards
the
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
,
who
had
found
a
snug
place
of
observation
in
a
distant
corner
,
where
he
stood
with
Mark
beside
him
(
for
he
did
not
so
often
forget
him
now
as
formerly
,
though
he
still
did
sometimes
)
,
thought
he
knew
this
gentleman
,
but
had
no
doubt
of
it
,
when
he
cried
as
loud
as
he
could
,
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
:
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
Mrs
Hominy
!
"
   
"
Lord
bless
that
woman
,
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
turned
up
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
she
comes
,
sir
,
"
answered
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pogram
knows
her
.
 
<EOS>
A
public
character
!
 
<EOS>
Always
got
her
eye
upon
her
country
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
If
that
there
lady
's
husband
is
of
my
opinion
,
what
a
jolly
old
gentleman
he
must
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
lane
was
made
;
and
Mrs
Hominy
,
with
the
aristocratic
stalk
,
the
pocket
handkerchief
,
the
clasped
hands
,
and
the
classical
cap
,
came
slowly
up
it
,
in
a
procession
of
one
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pogram
testified
emotions
of
delight
on
seeing
her
,
and
a
general
hush
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
known
that
when
a
woman
like
Mrs
Hominy
encountered
a
man
like
Pogram
,
something
interesting
must
be
said
.
   
<EOS>
Their
first
salutations
were
exchanged
in
a
voice
too
low
to
reach
the
impatient
ears
of
the
throng
;
but
they
soon
became
audible
,
for
Mrs
Hominy
felt
her
position
,
and
knew
what
was
expected
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
H
was
hard
upon
him
at
first
;
and
put
him
through
a
rigid
catechism
in
reference
to
a
certain
vote
he
had
given
,
which
she
had
found
it
necessary
,
as
the
mother
of
the
modern
Gracchi
,
to
deprecate
in
a
line
by
itself
,
set
up
expressly
for
the
purpose
in
German
text
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pogram
evading
it
by
a
well
-
timed
allusion
to
the
star
-
spangled
banner
,
which
,
it
appeared
,
had
the
remarkable
peculiarity
of
flouting
the
breeze
whenever
it
was
hoisted
where
the
wind
blew
,
she
forgave
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
now
enlarged
on
certain
questions
of
tariff
,
commercial
treaty
,
boundary
,
importation
and
exportation
with
great
effect
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Hominy
not
only
talked
,
as
the
saying
is
,
like
a
book
,
but
actually
did
talk
her
own
books
,
word
for
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Hominy
,
opening
a
little
note
which
was
handed
her
by
her
excited
gentleman
-
usher
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
tell
!
<EOS>
oh
,
well
,
now
!
<EOS>
on'y
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
then
she
read
aloud
,
as
follows
:
   
<EOS>
"
Two
literary
ladies
present
their
compliments
to
the
mother
of
the
modern
Gracchi
,
and
claim
her
kind
introduction
,
as
their
talented
countrywoman
,
to
the
honourable
(
and
distinguished
)
<EOS>
Elijah
Pogram
,
whom
the
two
L*L
's
have
often
contemplated
in
the
speaking
marble
of
the
soul
-
subduing
Chiggle
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
verbal
intimation
from
the
mother
of
the
M*G
,
that
she
will
comply
with
the
request
of
the
two
L*L
's
,
they
will
have
the
immediate
pleasure
of
joining
the
galaxy
assembled
to
do
honour
to
the
patriotic
conduct
of
a
Pogram
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
another
bond
of
union
between
the
two
L*L
's
and
the
mother
of
the
M*G
to
observe
,
that
the
two
L*L
's
are
Transcendental
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Hominy
promptly
rose
,
and
proceeded
to
the
door
,
whence
she
returned
,
after
a
minute
's
interval
,
with
the
two
L*L
's
,
whom
she
led
,
through
the
lane
in
the
crowd
,
with
all
that
stateliness
of
deportment
which
was
so
remarkably
her
own
,
up
to
the
great
Elijah
Pogram
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
(
as
the
shrill
boy
cried
out
in
an
ecstasy
)
quite
the
Last
Scene
from
Coriolanus
.
   
<EOS>
One
of
the
L*L
's
wore
a
brown
wig
of
uncommon
size
.
 
<EOS>
Sticking
on
the
forehead
of
the
other
,
by
invisible
means
,
was
a
massive
cameo
,
in
size
and
shape
like
the
raspberry
tart
which
is
ordinarily
sold
for
a
penny
,
representing
on
its
front
the
Capitol
at
Washington
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Toppit
,
and
Miss
Codger
!
"
said
Mrs
Hominy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Codger
's
the
lady
so
often
mentioned
in
the
English
newspapers
I
should
think
,
sir
,
"
whispered
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
oldest
inhabitant
as
never
remembers
anything
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
presented
to
a
Pogram
,
"
said
Miss
Codger
,
"
by
a
Hominy
,
indeed
,
<EOS>
a
thrilling
moment
is
it
in
its
impressiveness
on
what
we
call
our
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
we
call
them
so
,
or
why
impressed
they
are
,
or
if
impressed
they
are
at
all
,
or
if
at
all
we
are
,
or
if
there
really
is
,
<EOS>
oh
gasping
one
!
<EOS>
a
Pogram
or
a
Hominy
,
or
any
active
principle
to
which
we
give
those
titles
,
is
a
topic
,
Spirit
searching
,
light
abandoned
,
much
too
vast
to
enter
on
,
at
this
unlooked
-
for
crisis
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mind
and
matter
,
"
said
the
lady
in
the
wig
,
"
glide
swift
into
the
vortex
of
immensity
.
 
<EOS>
Howls
the
sublime
,
and
softly
sleeps
the
calm
Ideal
,
in
the
whispering
chambers
of
Imagination
.
 
<EOS>
To
hear
it
,
sweet
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
outlaughs
the
stern
philosopher
,
and
saith
to
the
Grotesque
,
"
<EOS>
What
ho
!
<EOS>
arrest
for
me
that
Agency
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
bring
it
here
!
"
<EOS>
And
so
the
vision
fadeth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
After
this
,
they
both
took
Mr
Pogram
by
the
hand
,
and
pressed
it
to
their
lips
,
as
a
patriotic
palm
.
 
<EOS>
That
homage
paid
,
the
mother
of
the
modern
Gracchi
called
for
chairs
,
and
the
three
literary
ladies
went
to
work
in
earnest
,
to
bring
poor
Pogram
out
,
and
make
him
show
himself
in
all
his
brilliant
colours
.
   
<EOS>
How
Pogram
got
out
of
his
depth
instantly
,
and
how
the
three
L*L
's
were
never
in
theirs
,
is
a
piece
of
history
not
worth
recording
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
,
that
being
all
four
out
of
their
depths
,
and
all
unable
to
swim
,
they
splashed
up
words
in
all
directions
,
and
floundered
about
famously
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
it
was
considered
to
have
been
the
severest
mental
exercise
ever
heard
in
the
National
Hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Tears
stood
in
the
shrill
boy
's
eyes
several
times
;
and
the
whole
company
observed
that
their
heads
ached
with
the
effort
---
as
well
they
might
.
   
<EOS>
When
it
at
last
became
necessary
to
release
Elijah
Pogram
from
the
corner
,
and
the
Committee
saw
him
safely
back
again
to
the
next
room
,
they
were
fervent
in
their
admiration
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
,
"
said
Mr
Buffum
,
"
must
have
vent
,
or
it
will
bust
.
 
<EOS>
Toe
you
,
Mr
Pogram
,
I
am
grateful
.
 
<EOS>
Toe

you
,
sir
,
I
am
inspired
with
lofty
veneration
,
and
with
deep

<EOS>
The
sentiment
Toe
which
I
would
propose
to
give
ex
-
pression
,
sir
,
is
this
:
"
May
you
ever
be
as
firm
,
sir
,
as
your
marble
statter
!
 
<EOS>
May
it
ever
be
as
great
a
terror
<EOS>
Toe

"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
is
some
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
rather
terrible
to
its
friends
;
being
a
statue
of
the
Elevated
or
Goblin
School
,
in
which
the
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
was
represented
as
in
a
very
high
wind
,
with
his
hair
all
standing
on
end
,
and
his
nostrils
blown
wide
open
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Pogram
thanked
his
friend
and
countryman
for
the
aspiration
to
which
he
had
given
utterance
,
and
the
Committee
,
after
another
solemn
shaking
of
hands
,
retired
to
bed
,
except
the
Doctor
;
who
immediately
repaired
to
the
newspaper
-
office
,
and
there
wrote
a
short
poem
suggested
by
the
events
of
the
evening
,
beginning
with
fourteen
stars
,
and
headed
,
"
A
Fragment
.
 
<EOS>
Suggested
by
witnessing
the
Honourable
Elijah
Pogram
engaged
in
a
philosophical
disputation
with

<EOS>
If
Pogram
was
as
glad
to
get
to
bed
as
Martin
was
,
he
must
have
been
well
rewarded
for
his
labours
.
 
<EOS>
They
started
off
again
next
day
(
Martin
and
Mark
previously
disposing
of
their
goods
to
the
storekeepers
of
whom
they
had
purchased
them
,
for
anything
they
would
bring
)
,
and
were
fellow
travellers
to
within
a
short
distance
of
New
York
.
 
<EOS>
When
Pogram
was
about
to
leave
them
he
grew
thoughtful
,
and
after
pondering
for
some
time
,
took
Martin
aside
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
air
going
to
part
,
sir
,
"
said
Pogram
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
distress
yourself
,
"
said
Martin
;
"
we
must
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
that
,
sir
,
"
returned
Pogram
,
"
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
should
wish
you
to
accept
a
copy
of
My
oration
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
you
are
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
most
happy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
quite
that
,
sir
,
neither
,
"
resumed
Pogram
;
"
air
you
bold
enough
to
introduce
a
copy
into
your
country
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Its
sentiments
air
strong
,
sir
,
"
hinted
Pogram
,
darkly
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
makes
no
difference
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
a
dozen
if
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Pogram
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
A
dozen
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
more
than
I
require
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
content
to
run
the
hazard
,
sir
,
here
is
one
for
your
Lord
Chancellor
,
"
producing
it
,
"
and
one
for
Your
principal
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
wish
them
to
see
it
,
sir
,
as
expressing
what
my
opinions
air
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
may
not
plead
ignorance
at
a
future
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
get
into
danger
,
sir
,
on
my
account
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
the
least
danger
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
put
the
pamphlets
in
his
pocket
,
and
they
parted
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bevan
had
written
in
his
letter
that
,
at
a
certain
time
,
which
fell
out
happily
just
then
,
he
would
be
at
a
certain
hotel
in
the
city
,
anxiously
expecting
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
place
they
repaired
without
a
moment
's
delay
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
him
within
;
and
of
being
received
by
their
good
friend
,
with
his
own
warmth
and
heartiness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
truly
sorry
and
ashamed
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
to
have
begged
of
you
.
<EOS>
But
look
at
us
.
 
<EOS>
See
what
we
are
,
and
judge
to
what
we
are
reduced
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
far
from
claiming
to
have
done
you
any
service
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
I
reproach
myself
with
having
been
,
unwittingly
,
<EOS>
the
original
cause
of
your
misfortunes
.
 
<EOS>
I
no
more
supposed
you
would
go
to
Eden
on
such
representations
as
you
received
;
or
,
indeed
,
that
you
would
do
anything
but
be
dispossessed
,
by
the
readiest
means
,
of
your
idea
that
fortunes
were
so
easily
made
here
;
than
I
thought
of
going
to
Eden
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
I
closed
with
the
thing
in
a
mad
and
sanguine
manner
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
and
the
less
said
about
it
the
better
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
,
here
,
had
n't
a
voice
in
the
matter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
but
he
had
n't
a
voice
in
any
other
matter
,
had
he
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Mr
Bevan
;
laughing
with
an
air
that
showed
his
understanding
of
Mark
and
Martin
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
a
very
powerful
one
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Martin
with
a
blush
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
live
and
learn
,
Mr
Bevan
!
 
<EOS>
Nearly
die
and
learn
;
we
learn
the
quicker
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
their
friend
,
"
about
your
plans
.
 
<EOS>
You
mean
to
return
home
at
once
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
think
so
,
"
returned
Martin
hastily
,
for
he
turned
pale
at
the
thought
of
any
other
suggestion
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
your
opinion
too
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unquestionably
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
do
n't
know
why
you
ever
came
here
;
though
it
's
not
such
an
unusual
case
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
that
we
need
go
any
farther
into
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
that
the
ship
in
which
you
came
over
with
our
friend
General
Fladdock
,
is
in
port
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
And
is
advertised
to
sail
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
tempting
news
,
but
tantalising
too
;
for
Martin
knew
that
his
getting
any
employment
on
board
a
ship
of
that
class
was
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
The
money
in
his
pocket
would
not
pay
one
-
fourth
of
the
sum
he
had
already
borrowed
,
and
if
it
had
been
enough
for
their
passage
-
money
,
he
could
hardly
have
resolved
to
spend
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
explained
this
to
Mr
Bevan
,
and
stated
what
their
project
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
's
as
wild
as
Eden
every
bit
,
"
returned
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
your
passage
like
a
Christian
;
at
least
,
as
like
a
Christian
as
a
fore
-
cabin
passenger
can
;
and
owe
me
a
few
more
dollars
than
you
intend
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mark
will
go
down
to
the
ship
and
see
what
passengers
there
are
,
and
finds
that
you
can
go
in
her
without
being
actually
suffocated
,
my
advice
is
,
go
!
 
<EOS>
You
and
I
will
look
about
us
in
the
meantime
(
we
wo
n't
call
at
the
Norris
's
unless
you
like
)
,
and
we
will
all
three
dine
together
in
the
afternoon
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
had
nothing
to
express
but
gratitude
,
and
so
it
was
arranged
.
<EOS>
But
he
went
out
of
the
room
after
Mark
,
and
advised
him
to
take
their
passage
in
the
Screw
,
though
they
lay
upon
the
bare
deck
;
which
Mr
Tapley
,
who
needed
no
entreaty
on
the
subject
readily
promised
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
and
Martin
met
again
,
and
were
alone
,
he
was
in
high
spirits
,
and
evidently
had
something
to
communicate
,
in
which
he
gloried
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
done
Mr
Bevan
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Done
Mr
Bevan
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
cook
of
the
Screw
went
and
got
married
yesterday
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
looked
at
him
for
farther
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
got
on
board
,
and
the
word
was
passed
that
it
was
me
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
the
mate
he
comes
and
asks
me
whether
I
'd
engage
to
take
this
<EOS>
said
cook
's
place
upon
the
passage
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
you
're
used
to
it
,
"
he
says
;
"
you
were
always
a
-
cooking
for
everybody
on
your
passage
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
was
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
although
I
never
cooked
before
,
I
'll
take
my
oath
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
"
demanded
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
'd
take
anything
I
could
get
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
that
's
so
,
"
says
the
mate
,
"
why
,
bring
a
glass
of
rum
;
"
which
they
brought
according
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
wages
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
in
high
glee
,
"
pays
your
passage
;
and
I
've
put
the
rolling
-
pin
in
your
berth
to
take
it
<EOS>
(
it
's
the
easy
one
up
in
the
corner
)
;
and
there
we
are
,
Rule
Britannia
,
and
Britons
strike
home
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
never
was
such
a
good
fellow
as
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
seizing
him
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
do
you
mean
by
"
doing
"
Mr
Bevan
,
Mark
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
do
n't
you
see
?
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
tell
him
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
We
take
his
money
,
but
we
do
n't
spend
it
,
and
we
do
n't
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
we
do
is
,
write
him
a
little
note
,
explaining
this
engagement
,
and
roll
it
up
,
and
leave
it
at
the
bar
,
to
be
given
to
him
after
we
are
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
?
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
's
delight
in
this
idea
was
not
inferior
to
Mark
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
done
as
he
proposed
.
 
<EOS>
They
passed
a
cheerful
evening
;
slept
at
the
hotel
;
left
the
letter
as
arranged
;
and
went
off
to
the
ship
betimes
next
morning
,
with
such
light
hearts
as
the
weight
of
their
past
miseries
engendered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
a
hundred
thousand
times
<EOS>
good
-
bye

said
Martin
to
their
friend

<EOS>
"
How
shall
I
remember
all
your
kindness
!
 
<EOS>
How
shall
I
ever
thank
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
ever
become
a
rich
man
,
or
a
powerful
one
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
"
you
shall
try
to
make
your
Government
more
careful
of
its
subjects
when
they
roam
abroad
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
it
what
you
know
of
emigration
in
your
own
case
,
and
impress
upon
it
how
much
suffering
may
be
prevented
with
a
little
pains

"
Why

<EOS>
what
are
you
thinking
of
so
steadily
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
was
a

thinking
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
,
"
that
if
I
was
a
painter
and
was
called
upon
to
paint
the
American
Eagle
,
how
should
I
do
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Paint
it
as

as
you
could
,
I
suppose

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
would
n't
do
for
me
,
sir

<EOS>
I
should
want
to
draw
it

for

Martin

Well

Let

hope
so

Chapter
35

<EOS>
Arriving
in
England
,
Martin
witnesses
a
ceremony
,
from
which
he
derives
the
cheering
information
that
he
has
not
been
forgotten
in
his
absence
 
<EOS>
It
was
mid
-
day
,
and
high
water
in
the
English
port
for
which
the
Screw
was
bound
,
<EOS>
when
,
borne
in
gallantly
upon
the
fullness
of
the
tide
,
she
let
go
her
anchor
in
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
Bright
as
the
scene
was
;
fresh
,
and
full
of
motion
;
airy
,
free
,
and
sparkling
;
it
was
nothing
to
the
life
and
exultation
in
the
breasts
of
the
two
travellers
,
at
sight
of
the
old
churches
,
roofs
,
and
darkened
chimney
stacks
of
Home
.
 
<EOS>
The
distant
roar
that
swelled
up
hoarsely
from
the
busy
streets
,
was
music
in
their
ears
;
the
lines
of
people
gazing
from
the
wharves
,
were
friends
held
dear
;
the
canopy
of
smoke
that
overhung
the
town
was
brighter
and
more
beautiful
to
them
than
if
the
richest
silks
of
Persia
had
been
waving
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
the
water
going
on
its
glistening
track
,
turned
,
ever
and
again
,
aside
to
dance
and
sparkle
round
great
ships
,
and
heave
them
up
;
and
leaped
from
off
the
blades
of
oars
,
a
shower
of
diving
diamonds
;
and
wantoned
with
the
idle
boats
,
and
swiftly
passed
,
in
many
a
sportive
chase
,
through
obdurate
old
iron
rings
,
set
deep
into
the
stone
-
work
of
the
quays
;
not
even
it
was
half
so
buoyant
,
and
so
restless
,
as
their
fluttering
hearts
,
when
yearning
to
set
foot
,
once
more
,
on
native
ground
.
   
<EOS>
A
year
had
passed
since
those
same
spires
and
roofs
had
faded
from
their
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
them
,
a
dozen
years
.
 
<EOS>
Some
trifling
changes
,
here
and
there
,
they
called
to
mind
;
and
wondered
that
they
were
so
few
and
slight
.
 
<EOS>
In
health
and
fortune
,
prospect
and
resource
,
they
came
back
poorer
men
than
they
had
gone
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
home
is
a
name
,
a
word
,
it
is
a
strong
one
;
stronger
than
magician
ever
spoke
,
or
spirit
answered
to
,
in
strongest
conjuration
.
   
<EOS>
Being
set
ashore
,
with
very
little
money
in
their
pockets
,
and
no
definite
plan
of
operation
in
their
heads
,
they
sought
out
a
cheap
tavern
,
where
they
regaled
upon
a
smoking
steak
,
and
certain
flowing
mugs
of
beer
,
as
only
men
just
landed
from
the
sea
can
revel
in
the
generous
dainties
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
feasted
,
as
two
grateful
-
tempered
giants
might
have
done
,
they
stirred
the
fire
,
drew
back
the
glowing
curtain
from
the
window
,
and
making
each
a
sofa
for
himself
,
by
union
of
the
great
unwieldy
chairs
,
gazed
blissfully
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
Even
the
street
was
made
a
fairy
street
,
by
being
half
hidden
in
an
atmosphere
of
steak
,
and
strong
,
stout
,
stand
-
up
English
beer
.
 
<EOS>
For
on
the
window
-
glass
hung
such
a
mist
,
that
Mr
Tapley
was
obliged
to
rise
and
wipe
it
with
his
handkerchief
,
before
the
passengers
appeared
like
common
mortals
.
 
<EOS>
And
even
then
,
a
spiral
little
cloud
went
curling
up
from
their
two
glasses
of
hot
grog
,
which
nearly
hid
them
from
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
unaccountable
little
rooms
which
are
never
seen
anywhere
but
in
a
tavern
,
and
are
supposed
to
have
got
into
taverns
by
reason
of
the
facilities
afforded
to
the
architect
for
getting
drunk
while
engaged
in
their
construction
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
more
corners
in
it
than
the
brain
of
an
obstinate
man
;
was
full
of
mad
closets
,
into
which
nothing
could
be
put
that
was
not
specially
invented
and
made
for
that
purpose
;
had
mysterious
shelvings
and
bulkheads
,
and
indications
of
staircases
in
the
ceiling
;
and
was
elaborately
provided
with
a
bell
that
rung
in
the
room
itself
,
about
two
feet
from
the
handle
,
and
had
no
connection
<EOS>
whatever
with
any
other
part
of
the
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
below
the
pavement
,
and
abutted
close
upon
it
;
so
that
passengers
grated
against
the
window
-
panes
with
their
buttons
,
and
scraped
it
with
their
baskets
;
and
fearful
boys
suddenly
coming
between
a
thoughtful
guest
and
the
light
,
derided
him
,
or
put
out
their
tongues
as
if
he
were
a
physician
;
or
made
white
knobs
on
the
ends
of
their
noses
by
flattening
the
same
against
the
glass
,
and
vanished
awfully
,
like
spectres
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
and
Mark
sat
looking
at
the
people
as
they
passed
,
debating
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
what
their
first
step
should
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
want
to
see
Miss
Mary
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
where
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
Not
having
had
the
heart
to
write
in
our
distress
---
you
yourself
thought
silence
most
advisable
---
and
consequently
,
never
having
heard
from
her
since
we
left
New
York
the
first
time
,
I
do
n't
know
where
she
is
,
my
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
is
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
,
"
that
what
we
've
got
to
do
is
to
travel
straight
to
the
Dragon
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
need
for
you
to
go
there
,
where
you
're
known
,
unless
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
stop
ten
mile
short
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
will
tell
me
all
the
news
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
will
give
me
every
information
that
we
want
;
and
right
glad
Mr
Pinch
will
be
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
proposal
is
:
To
set
off
walking
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
To
stop
when
we
are
tired
.
 
<EOS>
To
get
a
lift
when
we
can
.
<EOS>
To
walk
when
we
ca
n't
.
 
<EOS>
To
do
it
at
once
,
and
do
it
cheap
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unless
we
do
it
cheap
,
we
shall
have
some
difficulty
in
doing
it
at
all
,
"
said
Martin
,
pulling
out
the
bank
,
and
telling
it
over
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
greater
reason
for
losing
no
time
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mark
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereas
,
when
you
've
seen
the
young
lady
;
and
know
what
state
of
mind
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
's
in
,
and
all
about
it
;
then
you
'll
know
what
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
raising
their
glasses
to
their
lips
,
when
their
hands
stopped
midway
,
and
their
gaze
was
arrested
by
a
figure
which
slowly
,
very
slowly
,
and
reflectively
,
passed
the
window
at
that
moment
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Placid
,
calm
,
but
proud
.
 
<EOS>
Honestly
proud
.
 
<EOS>
Dressed
with
peculiar
care
,
smiling
with
even
more
than
usual
blandness
,
pondering
on
the
beauties
of
his
art
with
a
mild
abstraction
from
all
sordid
thoughts
,
and
gently
travelling
across
the
disc
,
as
if
he
were
a
figure
in
a
magic
lantern
.
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pecksniff
passed
,
a
person
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
stopped
to
look
after
him
with
great
interest
and
respect
,
almost
with
veneration
;
and
the
landlord
bouncing
out
of
the
house
,
as
if
he
had
seen
him
too
,
joined
this
person
,
and
spoke
to
him
,
and
shook
his
head
gravely
,
and
looked
after
Mr
Pecksniff
likewise
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
and
Mark
sat
staring
at
each
other
,
as
if
they
could
not
believe
it
;
but
there
stood
the
landlord
,
and
the
other
man
still
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
indignation
with
which
this
glimpse
of
Mr
Pecksniff
had
inspired
him
,
Martin
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
could
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
inquire
into
this
!
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
the
landlord
in
,
Mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
retired
for
that
purpose
,
and
immediately
returned
with
their
large
-
headed
host
in
safe
convoy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
landlord
!
<EOS>
"
said
Martin
,
"
who
is
that
gentleman
who
passed
just
now
,
and
whom
you
were
looking
after
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
poked
the
fire
as
if
,
in
his
desire
to
make
the
most
of
his
answer
,
he
had
become
indifferent
even
to
the
price
of
coals
;
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
said
,
after
inflating
himself
to
give
still
further
effect
to
his
reply
:
   
"
<EOS>
That
,
gentlemen
,
is
the
great
Mr
Pecksniff
!
 
<EOS>
The
celebrated
architect
,
gentlemen
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
from
one
to
the
other
while
he
said
it
,
as
if
he
were
ready
to
assist
the
first
man
who
might
be
overcome
by
the
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
great
Mr
Pecksniff
,
the
celebrated
architect
,
gentlemen
.
"
said
the
landlord
,
"
has
come
down
here
,
to
help
to
lay
the
first
stone
of
a
new
and
splendid
public
building
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
to
be
built
from
his
designs
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
great
Mr
Pecksniff
,
the
celebrated
architect
,
gentlemen
,
"
returned
the
landlord
,
who
seemed
to
have
an
unspeakable
delight
in
the
repetition
of
these
words
,
"
carried
off
the
First
Premium
,
and
will
erect
the
building
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
lays
the
stone
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
member
has
come
down
express
,
"
returned
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
scrubs
would
do
for
no
such
a
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
less
would
satisfy
our
Directors
than
our
member
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
who
is
returned
upon
the
Gentlemanly
Interest
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
interest
is
that
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
do
n't
you
know
!
"
returned
the
landlord
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
quite
clear
the
landlord
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
They
always
told
him
at
election
time
,
that
it
was
the
Gentlemanly
side
,
and
he
immediately
put
on
his
top
-
boots
,
and
voted
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
does
the
ceremony
take
place
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
day
,
"
replied
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
Then
pulling
out
his
watch
,
he
added
,
impressively
,
"
almost
this
minute
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
hastily
inquired
whether
there
was
any
possibility
of
getting
in
to
witness
it
;
and
finding
that
there
would
be
no
objection
to
the
admittance
of
any
decent
person
,
unless
indeed
the
ground
were
full
,
hurried
off
with
Mark
,
as
hard
as
they
could
go
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
fortunate
enough
to
squeeze
themselves
into
a
famous
corner
on
the
ground
,
where
they
could
see
all
that
passed
,
without
much
dread
of
being
beheld
by
Mr
Pecksniff
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
a
minute
too
soon
,
for
as
they
were
in
the
act
of
congratulating
each
other
<EOS>
,
a
great
noise
was
heard
at
some
distance
,
and
everybody
looked
towards
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
Several
ladies
prepared
their
pocket
handkerchiefs
for
waving
;
and
a
stray
teacher
belonging
to
the
charity
school
being
much
cheered
by
mistake
,
was
immensely
groaned
at
when
detected
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
has
Tom
Pinch
with
him
,
"
Martin
whispered
Mr
Tapley
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
rather
too
much
of
a
treat
for
him
,
would
n't
it
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mr
Tapley
in
return
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
to
discuss
the
probabilities
either
way
,
for
the
charity
school
,
in
clean
linen
,
came
filing
in
two
and
two
,
so
much
to
the
self
-
approval
of
all
the
people
present
who
did
n't
subscribe
to
it
,
that
many
of
them
shed
tears
.
 
<EOS>
A
band
of
music
followed
,
led
by
a
conscientious
drummer
who
never
left
off
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
a
great
many
gentlemen
with
wands
in
their
hands
,
and
bows
on
their
breasts
,
whose
share
in
the
proceedings
did
not
appear
to
be
distinctly
laid
down
,
and
who
trod
upon
each
other
,
and
blocked
up
the
entry
for
a
considerable
period
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
followed
by
the
Mayor
and
Corporation
,
all
clustering
round
the
member
for
the
Gentlemanly
Interest
;
who
had
the
great
Mr
Pecksniff
,
the
celebrated
architect
on
his
right
hand
,
and
conversed
with
him
familiarly
as
they
came
along
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
ladies
waved
their
handkerchiefs
,
and
the
gentlemen
their
hats
,
and
the
charity
children
shrieked
,
and
the
member
for
the
Gentlemanly
Interest
bowed
.
   
<EOS>
Silence
being
restored
,
the
member
for
the
Gentlemanly
Interest
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
wagged
his
head
,
and
looked
about
him
pleasantly
;
and
there
was
nothing
this
member
did
,
at
which
some
lady
or
other
did
not
burst
into
an
ecstatic
waving
of
her
pocket
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
looked
up
at
the
stone
,
they
said
how
graceful
!
<EOS>
when
he
peeped
into
the
hole
,
they
said
how
condescending
!
<EOS>
when
he
chatted
with
the
Mayor
,
they
said
how
easy
!
<EOS>
when
he
folded
his
arms
they
cried
with
one
accord
,
how
statesman
-
like
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
observed
too
,
closely
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
talked
to
the
Mayor
,
they
said
,
Oh
,
really
,
what
a
courtly
man
he
was
!
 
<EOS>
When
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
mason
's
shoulder
,
giving
him
directions
,
how
pleasant
his
demeanour
to
the
working
classes
;
just
the
sort
of
man
who
made
their
toil
a
pleasure
to
them
,
poor
dear
souls
!
   
<EOS>
But
now
a
silver
trowel
was
brought
;
and
when
the
member
for
the
Gentlemanly
Interest
,
tucking
up
his
coat
-
sleeve
,
did
a
little
sleight
of
hand
with
the
mortar
<EOS>
,
the
air
was
rent
,
so
loud
was
the
applause
.
 
<EOS>
The
workman
-
like
manner
in
which
he
did
it
was
amazing
.
<EOS>
No
one
could
conceive
where
such
a
gentlemanly
creature
could
have
picked
the
knowledge
up
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
made
a
kind
of
dirt
-
pie
under
the
direction
of
the
mason
,
they
brought
a
little
vase
containing
coins
,
the
which
the
member
for
the
Gentlemanly
Interest
jingled
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
conjure
.
 
<EOS>
Whereat
they
said
how
droll
,
how
cheerful
,
what
a
flow
of
spirits
!
 
<EOS>
This
put
into
its
place
,
an
ancient
scholar
read
the
inscription
,
which
was
in
Latin
;
not
in
English
;
that
would
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
gave
great
satisfaction
;
especially
every
time
there
was
a
good
long
substantive
in
the
third
declension
,
ablative
case
,
with
an
adjective
to
match
;
at
which
periods
the
assembly
became
very
tender
,
and
were
much
affected
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
the
stone
was
lowered
down
into
its
place
,
amidst
the
shouting
of
the
concourse
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
firmly
fixed
,
the
member
for
the
Gentlemanly
Interest
struck
upon
it
thrice
with
the
handle
of
the
trowel
,
as
if
inquiring
,
with
a
touch
of
humour
,
whether
anybody
was
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
then
unrolled
his
Plans
(
prodigious
plans
they
were
)
,
and
people
gathered
round
to
look
at
and
admire
them
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
,
who
had
been
fretting
himself
---
quite
unnecessarily
,
as
Mark
thought
---
during
the
whole
of
these
proceedings
,
could
no
longer
restrain
his
impatience
;
but
stepping
forward
among
several
others
,
looked
straight
over
the
shoulder
of
the
unconscious
Mr
Pecksniff
,
at
the
designs
and
plans
he
had
unrolled
.
 
<EOS>
He
returned
to
Mark
,
boiling
with
rage
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
,
sir
?
"
cried
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Matter
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
MY
building
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
building
,
sir
!
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
grammar
-
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
invented
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
only
put
four
windows
in
,
the
villain
,
and
spoilt
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
could
hardly
believe
it
at
first
,
but
being
assured
that
it
was
really
so
,
actually
held
him
to
prevent
his
interference
foolishly
,
until
his
temporary
heat
was
past
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
the
member
addressed
the
company
on
the
gratifying
deed
which
he
had
just
performed
.
   
<EOS>
He
said
that
since
he
had
sat
in
Parliament
to
represent
the
Gentlemanly
Interest
of
that
town
;
and
he
might
add
,
the
Lady
Interest
,
he
hoped
,
besides
(
pocket
handkerchiefs
)
;
it
had
been
his
pleasant
duty
to
come
among
them
,
and
to
raise
his
voice
on
their
behalf
in
Another
Place
(
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
laughter
)
,
often
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
never
come
among
them
,
and
had
never
raised
his
voice
,
with
half
such
pure
,
such
deep
,
such
unalloyed
delight
,
as
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
present
occasion
,
"
he
said
,
"
will
ever
be
memorable
to
me
;
not
only
for
the
reasons
I
have
assigned
,
but
because
it
has
afforded
me
an
opportunity
of
becoming
personally
known
to
a
gentleman
---
"
   
<EOS>
Here
he
pointed
the
trowel
at
Mr
Pecksniff
,
who
was
greeted
with
vociferous
cheering
,
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
a
gentleman
who
,
I
am
happy
to
believe
,
will
reap
both
distinction
and
profit
from
this
field
;
whose
fame
had
previously
penetrated
to
me
---
as
to
whose
ears
has
it
not
!
<EOS>
---
but
whose
intellectual
countenance
I
never
had
the
distinguished
honour
to
behold
until
this
day
,
and
whose
intellectual
conversation
<EOS>
I
had
never
before
the
improving
pleasure
to
enjoy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Everybody
seemed
very
glad
of
this
,
and
applauded
more
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
hope
my
Honourable
Friend
,
"
said
the
Gentlemanly
member
<EOS>
---
of
course
he
added
"
if
he
will
allow
me
to
call
him
so
,
"
and
of
course
Mr
Pecksniff
bowed
---
"
will
give
me
many
opportunities
of
cultivating
the
knowledge
of
him
;
and
that
I
may
have
the
extraordinary
gratification
of
reflecting
in
after
-
time
that
I
laid
on
this
day
two
first
stones
,
both
belonging
to
structures
which
shall
last
my
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
Great
cheering
again
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
Martin
was
cursing
Mr
Pecksniff
up
hill
and
down
dale
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
friends
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
duty
is
to
build
,
not
speak
;
to
act
,
not
talk
;
to
deal
with
marble
,
stone
,
and
brick
;
not
language
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
affected
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
address
,
pumped
out
apparently
from
Mr
Pecksniff
's
very
heart
,
brought
the
enthusiasm
to
its
highest
pitch
.
 
<EOS>
The
pocket
handkerchiefs
were
waved
again
;
the
charity
children
were
admonished
to
grow
up
Pecksniffs
,
every
boy
among
them
;
the
Corporation
,
gentlemen
with
wands
,
member
for
the
Gentlemanly
Interest
,
all
cheered
for
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Three
cheers
for
Mr
Pecksniff
!
 
<EOS>
Three
more
for
Mr
Pecksniff
!
 
<EOS>
Three
more
for
Mr
Pecksniff
,
gentlemen
,
if
you
please
!
 
<EOS>
One
more
,
gentlemen
,
for
Mr
Pecksniff
,
and
let
it
be
a
good
one
to
finish
with
!
   
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mr
Pecksniff
was
supposed
to
have
done
a
great
work
and
was
very
kindly
,
courteously
,
and
generously
rewarded
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
procession
moved
away
,
and
Martin
and
Mark
were
left
almost
alone
upon
the
ground
,
his
merits
and
a
desire
to
acknowledge
them
formed
the
common
topic
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
only
second
to
the
Gentlemanly
member
.
   
<EOS>
"
Compare
the
fellow
's
situation
to
-
day
with
ours
!
"
said
Martin
bitterly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
,
"
what
's
the
use
?
 
<EOS>
Some
architects
are
clever
at
making
foundations
,
and
some
architects
are
clever
at
building
on
'em
when
they
're
made
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
'll
all
come
right
in
the
end
,
sir
;
it
'll
all
come
right
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
in
the
meantime
---
"
began
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
,
as
you
say
,
sir
,
we
have
a
deal
to
do
,
and
far
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
So
sharp
's
the
word
,
and
Jolly
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
best
master
in
the
world
,
Mark
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
and
I
will
not
be
a
bad
scholar
if
I
can
help
it
<EOS>
,
I
am
resolved
!
 
<EOS>
So
come
!
<EOS>
Best
foot
foremost
,
old
fellow

Chapter
36
.
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
departs
to
seek
his
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
What
he
finds
at
starting
 
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
different
town
Salisbury
was
in
Tom
Pinch
's
eyes
to
be
sure
,
when
the
substantial
Pecksniff
of
his
heart
melted
away
into
an
idle
dream
!
 
<EOS>
He
possessed
the
same
faith
in
the
wonderful
shops
,
the
same
intensified
appreciation
of
the
mystery
and
wickedness
of
the
place
;
made
the
same
exalted
estimate
of
its
wealth
,
population
,
and
resources
;
and
yet
it
was
not
the
old
city
nor
anything
like
it
.
<EOS>
He
walked
into
the
market
while
they
were
getting
breakfast
ready
for
him
at
the
Inn
;
and
though
it
was
the
same
market
as
of
old
,
crowded
by
the
same
buyers
and
sellers
;
brisk
with
the
same
business
;
noisy
with
the
same
confusion
of
tongues
and
cluttering
of
fowls
in
coops
;
fair
with
the
same
display
of
rolls
of
butter
,
newly
made
,
set
forth
in
linen
cloths
of
dazzling
whiteness
;
green
with
the
same
fresh
show
of
dewy
vegetables
;
<EOS>
dainty
with
the
same
array
in
higglers
'
baskets
of
small
shaving
-
glasses
,
laces
,
braces
,
trouser
-
straps
,
and
hardware
;
savoury
with
the
same
unstinted
show
of
delicate
pigs
'
feet
,
and
pies
made
precious
by
the
pork
that
once
had
walked
upon
them
;
still
it
was
strangely
changed
to
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
in
the
centre
of
the
market
-
place
,
he
missed
a
statue
he
had
set
up
there
as
in
all
other
places
of
his
personal
resort
;
and
it
looked
cold
and
bare
without
that
ornament
.
   
<EOS>
The
change
lay
no
deeper
than
this
,
for
Tom
was
far
from
being
sage
enough
to
know
,
that
,
having
been
disappointed
in
one
man
,
it
would
have
been
a
strictly
rational
and
eminently
wise
proceeding
to
have
revenged
himself
upon
mankind
in
general
,
by
mistrusting
them
one
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
this
piece
of
justice
,
though
it
is
upheld
by
the
authority
of
divers
profound
poets
and
honourable
men
,
bears
a
nearer
resemblance
to
the
justice
of
that
good
Vizier
in
the
Thousand
-
and
-
one
Nights
,
who
issues
orders
for
the
destruction
of
all
the
Porters
in
Bagdad
because
one
of
that
unfortunate
fraternity
is
supposed
to
have
misconducted
himself
,
than
to
any
logical
,
not
to
say
Christian
,
system
of
conduct
,
known
to
the
world
in
later
times
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
had
so
long
been
used
to
steep
the
Pecksniff
of
his
fancy
in
his
tea
,
and
spread
him
out
upon
his
toast
,
and
take
him
as
a
relish
with
his
beer
,
that
he
made
but
a
poor
breakfast
on
the
first
morning
after
his
expulsion
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
much
improve
his
appetite
for
dinner
by
seriously
considering
his
own
affairs
,
and
taking
counsel
thereon
with
his
friend
the
organist
's
assistant
.
   
<EOS>
The
organist
's
assistant
gave
it
as
his
decided
opinion
that
whatever
Tom
did
,
he
must
go
to
London
;
for
there
was
no
place
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
Which
may
be
true
in
the
main
,
though
hardly
,
perhaps
,
in
itself
,
a
sufficient
reason
for
Tom
's
going
there
.
   
<EOS>
But
Tom
had
thought
of
London
before
,
and
had
coupled
with
it
thoughts
of
his
sister
,
and
of
his
old
friend
John
Westlock
,
whose
advice
he
naturally
felt
disposed
to
seek
in
this
important
crisis
of
his
fortunes
.
 
<EOS>
To
London
,
therefore
,
he
resolved
to
go
;
and
he
went
away
to
the
coach
-
office
at
once
,
to
secure
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
being
already
full
,
he
was
obliged
to
postpone
his
departure
until
the
next
night
;
but
even
this
circumstance
had
its
bright
side
as
well
as
its
dark
one
,
for
though
it
threatened
to
reduce
his
poor
purse
with
unexpected
country
charges
,
it
afforded
him
an
opportunity
of
writing
to
Mrs
Lupin
and
appointing
his
box
to
be
brought
to
the
old
finger
-
post
at
the
old
time
;
which
would
enable
him
to
take
that
treasure
with
him
to
the
metropolis
,
and
save
the
expense
of
its
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
"
said
Tom
,
<EOS>
comforting
himself
,
"
it
's
very
nearly
as
broad
as
it
's
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
it
can
not
be
denied
that
,
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
even
this
extent
,
he
felt
an
unaccustomed
sense
of
freedom
---
a
vague
and
indistinct
impression
of
holiday
-
making
---
which
was
very
luxurious
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
moments
of
depression
and
anxiety
,
and
they
were
,
with
good
reason
,
pretty
numerous
;
but
still
,
it
was
wonderfully
pleasant
to
reflect
that
he
was
his
own
master
,
and
could
plan
and
scheme
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
startling
,
thrilling
,
vast
,
difficult
to
understand
;
it
was
a
stupendous
truth
,
teeming
with
responsibility
and
self
-
distrust
;
but
in
spite
of
all
his
cares
,
it
gave
a
curious
relish
to
the
viands
at
the
Inn
,
and
interposed
a
dreamy
haze
between
him
and
his
prospects
,
in
which
they
sometimes
showed
to
magical
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
unsettled
state
of
mind
,
Tom
went
once
more
to
bed
in
the
low
four
-
poster
,
to
the
same
immovable
surprise
of
the
effigies
of
the
former
landlord
and
the
fat
ox
;
and
in
this
condition
,
passed
the
whole
of
the
succeeding
day
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
coach
came
round
at
last
with
"
London
"
blazoned
in
letters
of
gold
upon
the
boot
,
it
gave
Tom
such
a
turn
,
that
he
was
half
disposed
to
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
did
n't
do
it
;
for
he
took
his
seat
upon
the
box
instead
,
and
looking
down
upon
the
four
greys
,
felt
as
if
he
were
another
grey
himself
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
a
part
of
the
turn
-
out
;
and
was
quite
confused
by
the
novelty
and
splendour
of
his
situation
.
   
<EOS>
And
really
it
might
have
confused
a
less
modest
man
than
Tom
to
find
himself
sitting
next
that
coachman
;
for
of
all
the
swells
that
ever
flourished
a
whip
professionally
,
he
might
have
been
elected
emperor
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
handle
his
gloves
like
another
man
,
but
put
them
on
---
even
when
he
was
standing
on
the
pavement
,
quite
detached
from
the
coach
---
as
if
the
four
greys
were
,
somehow
or
other
,
at
the
ends
of
the
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
with
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
things
with
his
hat
,
which
nothing
but
an
unlimited
knowledge
of
horses
and
the
wildest
freedom
of
the
road
,
could
ever
have
made
him
perfect
in
.
<EOS>
Valuable
little
parcels
were
brought
to
him
with
particular
instructions
,
and
he
pitched
them
into
this
hat
,
and
stuck
it
on
again
;
as
if
the
laws
of
gravity
did
not
admit
of
such
an
event
as
its
being
knocked
off
or
blown
off
,
and
nothing
like
an
accident
could
befall
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
guard
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
Seventy
breezy
miles
a
day
were
written
in
his
very
whiskers
.
 
<EOS>
His
manners
were
a
canter
;
<EOS>
his
conversation
a
round
trot
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
fast
coach
upon
a
down
-
hill
turnpike
road
;
he
was
all
pace
.
 
<EOS>
A
waggon
could
n't
have
moved
slowly
,
with
that
guard
and
his
key
-
bugle
on
the
top
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
These
were
all
foreshadowings
of
London
,
<EOS>
Tom
thought
,
as
he
sat
upon
the
box
,
and
looked
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
coachman
,
and
such
a
guard
,
never
could
have
existed
between
Salisbury
and
any
other
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
was
none
of
your
steady
-
going
,
yokel
coaches
,
but
a
swaggering
,
rakish
,
dissipated
London
coach
;
up
all
night
,
and
lying
by
all
day
,
and
leading
a
devil
of
a
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
cared
no
more
for
Salisbury
than
if
it
had
been
a
hamlet
.
 
<EOS>
It
rattled
noisily
through
the
best
streets
,
defied
the
Cathedral
,
took
the
worst
corners
sharpest
,
went
cutting
in
everywhere
,
making
everything
get
out
of
its
way
;
and
spun
along
the
open
country
-
road
,
blowing
a
lively
defiance
out
of
its
key
-
bugle
,
as
its
last
glad
parting
legacy
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
charming
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Mild
and
bright
.
 
<EOS>
And
even
with
the
weight
upon
his
mind
which
arose
out
of
the
immensity
and
uncertainty
of
London
,
Tom
could
not
resist
the
captivating
sense
of
rapid
motion
through
the
pleasant
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
four
greys
skimmed
along
,
as
if
they
liked
it
quite
as
well
as
Tom
did
;
the
bugle
was
in
as
high
spirits
as
the
greys
;
the
coachman
chimed
in
sometimes
with
his
voice
;
the
wheels
hummed
cheerfully
in
unison
;
the
brass
work
on
the
harness
was
an
orchestra
of
little
bells
;
and
thus
,
as
they
went
clinking
,
jingling
,
rattling
smoothly
on
,
the
whole
concern
,
from
the
buckles
of
the
leaders
'
coupling
-
reins
to
the
handle
of
the
hind
boot
,
was
one
great
instrument
of
music
.

Yoho

past

Yoho

past
donkey

drawn
aside
into
the

and
empty
carts
with
rampant

whipped
up
at
a

close

Yoho

rustic

Yoho

the

cool
their

Yoho

Yoho

Yoho

<EOS>
Was
the
box
there
,
when
they
came
up
to
the
old
finger

post
?
 
<EOS>
The
box
!
 
<EOS>
Was
Mrs
Lupin
herself
?
 
<EOS>
Had
she
turned
out
magnificently
as
a
hostess
should
,
in
her
own
chaise
-
cart
,
and
was
she
sitting
in
a
mahogany
chair
,
driving
her
own
horse
Dragon
(
who
ought
to
have
been
called
Dumpling
)
,
and
looking
lovely
?
 
<EOS>
Did
the
stage
-
coach
pull
up
beside
her
,
shaving
her
very
wheel
,
and
even
while
the
guard
helped
her
man
up
with
the
trunk
,
did
he
send
the
glad
echoes
of
his
bugle
careering
down
the
chimneys
of
the
distant
Pecksniff
,
as
if
the
coach
expressed
its
exultation
in
the
rescue
of
Tom
Pinch
?
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
kind
indeed
!
"
said
Tom
,
bending
down
to
shake
hands
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
give
you
this
trouble
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Trouble
,
Mr
Pinch
!
"
cried
the
hostess
of
the
Dragon
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
pleasure
to
you
,
I
know
,
"
said
Tom
,
squeezing
her
hand
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
news
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
hostess
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
you
saw
me
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
and
that
I
was
very
bold
and
cheerful
,
and
not
a
bit
down
-
hearted
;
and
that
I
entreated
her
to
be
the
same
,
for
all
is
certain
to
come
right
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
write
when
you
get
settled
,
Mr
Pinch
?
"
said
Mrs
Lupin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
I
get
settled
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
with
an
involuntary
opening
of
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
'll
write
when
I
get
settled
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
had
better
write
before
,
because
I
may
find
that
it
takes
a
little
time
to
settle
myself
;
not
having
too
much
money
,
and
having
only
one
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
give
your
love
to
the
friend
,
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
always
great
with
Mr
Westlock
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Lupin
,
hastily
producing
a
basket
with
a
long
bottle
sticking
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
this
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
me
to
carry
it
to
London
for
you
?
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
already
turning
the
chaise
-
cart
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mrs
Lupin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
a
little
something
for
refreshment
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
fast
,
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
Drive
on
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
All
right
!
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
,
before
Tom
collected
himself
;
and
then
he
was
waving
his
hand
lustily
;
and
so
was
she
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
the
last
of
the
old
finger
-
post
,
"
thought
Tom
,
straining
his
eyes
,
"
where
I
have
so
often
stood
to
see
this
very
coach
go
by
,
and
where
I
have
parted
with
so
many
companions
!
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
compare
this
coach
to
some
great
monster
that
appeared
at
certain
times
to
bear
my
friends
away
into
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
it
's
bearing
me
away
,
to
seek
my
fortune
<EOS>
,
Heaven
knows
where
and
how
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
made
Tom
melancholy
to
picture
himself
walking
up
the
lane
and
back
to
Pecksniff
's
as
of
old
;
and
being
melancholy
,
he
looked
downwards
at
the
basket
on
his
knee
,
which
he
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
kindest
and
most
considerate
creature
in
the
world
,
"
thought
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
I
KNOW
that
she
particularly
told
that
man
of
hers
not
to
look
at
me
,
on
purpose
to
prevent
my
throwing
him
a
shilling
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
it
ready
for
him
all
the
time
,
and
he
never
once
looked
towards
me
;
whereas
that
man
naturally
,
(
for
I
know
him
very
well
,
)
would
have
done
nothing
but
grin
and
stare
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
the
kindness
of
people
perfectly
melts
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
he
caught
the
coachman
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
The
coachman
winked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remarkable
fine
woman
for
her
time
of
life
,
"
said
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
"
returned
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
she
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Finer
than
many
a
young
'
un
,
I
mean
to
say
,
"
observed
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Than
many
a
young
one
,
"
Tom
assented
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
'em
myself
when
they
're
too
young
,
"
remarked
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
matter
of
taste
,
which
Tom
did
not
feel
himself
called
upon
to
discuss
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
seldom
find
'em
possessing
correct
opinions
about
refreshment
,
for
instance
,
when
they
're
too
young
,
you
know
,
"
said
the
coachman
;
"
a
woman
must
have
arrived
at
maturity
,
before
her
mind
's
equal
to
coming
provided
with
a
basket
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
know
what
it
contains
?
"
said
Tom
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
coachman
only
laughed
,
and
as
Tom
was
curious
himself
,
he
unpacked
it
,
and
put
the
articles
,
one
by
one
,
upon
the
footboard
.
<EOS>
A
cold
roast
fowl
,
a
packet
of
ham
in
slices
,
a
crusty
loaf
,
a
piece
of
cheese
,
a
paper
of
biscuits
,
half
a
dozen
apples
,
a
knife
,
some
butter
,
a
screw
of
salt
,
and
a
bottle
of
old
sherry
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
letter
besides
,
which
Tom
put
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
The
coachman
was
so
earnest
in
his
approval
of
Mrs
Lupin
's
provident
habits
,
and
congratulated
Torn
so
warmly
on
his
good
fortune
,
that
Tom
felt
it
necessary
,
for
the
lady
's
sake
,
to
explain
that
the
basket
was
a
strictly
Platonic
basket
,
and
had
merely
been
presented
to
him
in
the
way
of
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
made
the
statement
with
perfect
gravity
;
for
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
disabuse
the
mind
of
this
lax
rover
of
any
incorrect
impressions
on
the
subject
;
he
signified
that
he
would
be
happy
to
share
the
gifts
with
him
,
and
proposed
that
they
should
attack
the
basket
in
a
spirit
of
good
fellowship
at
any
time
in
the
course
of
the
night
which
the
coachman
's
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
road
might
suggest
,
as
being
best
adapted
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
time
they
chatted
so
pleasantly
together
,
that
although
Tom
knew
infinitely
more
of
unicorns
than
horses
,
the
coachman
informed
his
friend
the
guard
at
the
end
of
the
next
stage
,
"
that
rum
as
the
box
-
seat
looked
,
he
was
as
good
a
one
to
go
,
in
pint
of
conversation
,
as
ever
he
'd
wish
to
sit
by
.
"
   
<EOS>
Yoho
,
among
the
gathering
shades
;
making
of
no
account
the
deep
reflections
of
the
trees
,
but
scampering
on
through
light
and
darkness
,
all
the
same
,
as
if
the
light
of
London
fifty
miles
away
,
were
quite
enough
to
travel
by
,
and
some
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
Yoho
,
beside
the
village
green
,
where
cricket
-
players
linger
yet
,
and
every
little
indentation
made
in
the
fresh
grass
by
bat
or
wicket
,
ball
or
player
's
foot

sheds
out
its
perfume
on

night

Away
with
four
fresh
horses
from
the
Bald

faced
Stag

where
topers
congregate
about
the
door
admiring
;
and
the
last
team
with
traces
hanging
loose
,
go
roaming
off
towards
the
pond
,
until
observed
and
shouted
after
by
a
dozen
throats
,
while
volunteering
boys
pursue
them
.

Now

with
a
clattering
of
hoofs
and
striking
out
of
fiery
sparks
,
across
the
old
stone
bridge
,
and
down
again
into
the
shadowy
road
,
and
through
the
open
gate
,
and
far
away

away

into
the
wold

Yoho

Yoho

Come
creeping
over

front

along
the
coach

roof

make
one
at
this
basket

<EOS>
Not

we
slacken
in

not
we

we
rather
put
the

Ah

It
is
long
since
this
bottle
of
old
wine
was
brought
into
contact
with
the
mellow
breath

night

you
may
depend

rare
good

it

Yoho

Yoho

See

High

making
the

reflect
the

on
its
breast
like
water

Hedges

trees

low
cottages
,
church
steeples
,
blighted
stumps
and
flourishing
young
slips

have
all
grown
vain
upon

contemplate
their

images
till
morning

The
poplars
yonder
rustle

their
quivering
leaves
may
see
themselves
upon
the
ground

<EOS>
Not
so
the
oak
<EOS>
;
trembling
does
not
become
HIM

and
he
watches
himself
in
his
stout
old
burly
steadfastness

without
the
motion
of
a
twig

<EOS>
The
moss

grown
gate

ill

poised
upon
its
creaking
hinges
,
crippled
and
decayed
swings
to

before
its
glass

like
some
fantastic
dowager

while
our
own
ghostly

travels
on

Yoho

<EOS>
Yoho

<EOS>
through
ditch
and
brake
,
upon
the
ploughed
land
and
the
smooth

along
the
steep

as

a
phantom

Hunter

Clouds

<EOS>
And
a
mist
upon
the
Hollow

<EOS>
Not
a
dull
fog
that
hides
it
,
but
a
light
airy
gauze
-
like
mist
,
which
in
our
eyes
of
modest
admiration
gives
a
new
charm
to
the
beauties
it
is
spread
before

as
real
gauze

Yoho

Why
now
we
travel
like
the
Moon
herself

<EOS>
Hiding
this
minute
in
a
grove
of
trees
;
next
minute
in
a
patch
of
vapour
;
emerging
now
upon
our
broad
clear
course
;
withdrawing
now
,
but
always
dashing
on
,
our
journey
is
a
counter

part

Yoho

<EOS>
A
match

the
Moon

The
beauty

Day
comes
rushing
up

<EOS>
Yoho

Two

and
squares
;
past
waggons
,
coaches
,
carts
;
past
early
workmen
,
late
stragglers
,
drunken
men
,
and
sober
carriers
of
loads
;
past
brick
and
mortar
in
its
every
shape
;
and
in
among
the
rattling
pavements
,
where
a
jaunty
-
seat
upon
a
coach
is
not
so
easy
to
preserve
!
 
<EOS>
Yoho
,
down
countless
turnings
,
and
through
countless
mazy
ways
,
until
an
old
Innyard
is
gained
,
and
Tom
Pinch
,
getting
down
quite
stunned
and
giddy
,
is
in
London
!
   
<EOS>
"
Five
minutes
before
the
time
,
too
!
"
said
the
driver
,
as
he
received
his
fee
of
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
should
not
have
minded
very
much
,
if
we
had
been
five
hours
after
it
;
for
at
this
early
hour
I
do
n't
know
where
to
go
,
or
what
to
do
with
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
they
expect
you
then
?
"
inquired
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
them
,
"
returned
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
His
mind
was
so
clearly
running
on
the
assumption
of
Tom
's
having
come
to
town
to
see
an
extensive
circle
of
anxious
relations
and
friends
,
that
it
would
have
been
pretty
hard
work
to
undeceive
him
.
<EOS>
Tom
did
not
try
.
 
<EOS>
He
cheerfully
evaded
the
subject
,
and
going
into
the
Inn
,
fell
fast
asleep
before
a
fire
in
one
of
the
public
rooms
opening
from
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
,
the
people
in
the
house
were
all
astir
,
so
he
washed
and
dressed
himself
;
to
his
great
refreshment
after
the
journey
;
and
,
it
being
by
that
time
eight
o'clock
,
went
forth
at
once
to
see
his
old
friend
John
.
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
lived
in
Furnival
's
Inn
,
High
Holborn
,
which
was
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
walk
of
Tom
's
starting
-
point
,
but
seemed
a
long
way
off
,
by
reason
of
his
going
two
or
three
miles
out
of
the
straight
road
to
make
a
short
cut
.
 
<EOS>
When
at
last
he
arrived
outside
John
's
door
,
two
stories
up
,
he
stood
faltering
with
his
hand
upon
the
knocker
,
and
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
was
rendered
very
nervous
by
the
thought
of
having
to
relate
what
had
fallen
out
between
himself
and
Pecksniff
;
and
he
had
a
misgiving
that
John
would
exult
fearfully
in
the
disclosure
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
must
be
made
,
"
thought
Tom
,
"
sooner
or
later
;
and
I
had
better
get
it
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rat
tat
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
that
's
not
a
London
knock
,
"
thought
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
did
n't
sound
bold
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
that
's
the
reason
why
nobody
answers
the
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
quite
certain
that
nobody
came
,
and
that
Tom
stood
looking
at
the
knocker
;
wondering
whereabouts
in
the
neighbourhood
a
certain
gentleman
resided
,
who
was
roaring
out
to
somebody
"
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
with
all
his
might
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Tom
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
lives
here
,
and
is
calling
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Can
I
open
the
door
from
the
outside
,
I
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
be
sure
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
To
be
sure
he
could
,
by
turning
the
handle
;
and
to
be
sure
when
he
did
turn
it
<EOS>
the
same
voice
came
rushing
out
,
crying
"
Why
do
n't
you
come
in
?
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
do
you
hear
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
standing
there
for
?
"
<EOS>
---
 
quite
violently
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
stepped
from
the
little
passage
into
the
room
from
which
these
sounds
proceeded
,
and
had
barely
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
gentleman
in
a
dressing
-
gown
and
slippers
(
with
his
boots
beside
him
ready
to
put
on
)
,
sitting
at
his
breakfast
with
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
,
when
the
said
gentleman
,
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
oversetting
his
tea
-
table
,
made
a
plunge
at
Tom
,
and
hugged
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Tom
,
my
boy
!
"
cried
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
glad
I
am
to
see
you
,
Mr
Westlock
!
"
said
Tom
Pinch
,
shaking
both
his
hands
,
and
trembling
more
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
kind
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Westlock
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
John
,
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
,
Pinch
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
forgotten
my
Christian
name
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
John
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
forgotten
,
"
said
Thomas
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
me
,
how
kind
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
such
a
fellow
in
all
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
saying
THAT
over
and
over
again
?
 
<EOS>
What
did
you
expect
me
to
be
,
I
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
Here
,
sit
down
,
Tom
,
and
be
a
reasonable
creature
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
,
my
boy
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
delighted
to
see
YOU
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
mutual
,
of
course
,
"
returned
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
always
was
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
known
you
had
been
coming
,
Tom
,
I
would
have
had
something
for
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
have
such
a
surprise
than
the
best
breakfast
in
the
world
,
myself
;
but
yours
is
another
case
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
you
are
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
make
out
as
well
as
you
can
,
Tom
,
and
we
'll
recompense
ourselves
at
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
You
take
sugar
,
I
know
;
I
recollect
the
sugar
at
Pecksniff
's
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
How
IS
Pecksniff
?
 
<EOS>
When
did
you
come
to
town
?
 
<EOS>
DO
begin
at
something
or
other
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
only
scraps
here
,
but
they
are
not
at
all
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Boar
's
Head
potted
.
 
<EOS>
Try
it
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Make
a
beginning
whatever
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
What
an
old
Blade
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
While
he
delivered
himself
of
these
words
in
a
state
of
great
commotion
,
John
was
constantly
running
backwards
and
forwards
to
and
from
the
closet
,
bringing
out
all
sorts
of
things
in
pots
,
scooping
extraordinary
quantities
of
tea
out
of
the
caddy
,
dropping
French
rolls
into
his
boots
,
pouring
hot
water
over
the
butter
,
and
making
a
variety
of
similar
mistakes
without
disconcerting
himself
in
the
least
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
John
,
sitting
down
for
the
fiftieth
time
,
and
instantly
starting
up
again
to
make
some
other
addition
to
the
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
we
are
as
well
off
as
we
are
likely
to
be
till
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
have
the
news
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Imprimis
,
how
's
Pecksniff
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
he
is
,
"
was
Tom
's
grave
answer
.
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
put
the
teapot
down
,
and
looked
at
him
,
in
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
he
is
,
"
said
Thomas
Pinch
;
"
and
,
saving
that
I
wish
him
no
ill
,
I
do
n't
care
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
left
him
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
left
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Voluntarily
?
"
   
"
Why
,
no
,
for
he
dismissed
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
first
found
out
that
I
was
mistaken
in
him
;
and
I
could
not
have
remained
with
him
under
any
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
say
that
you
were
right
in
your
estimate
of
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
ridiculous
weakness
,
John
,
but
it
has
been
very
painful
and
bitter
to
me
to
find
this
out
,
I
do
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
had
no
need
to
direct
that
appealing
look
towards
his
friend
,
in
mild
and
gentle
deprecation
of
his
answering
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
John
Westlock
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
striking
him
down
upon
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
all
a
dream
of
mine
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
and
it
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
happened
,
at
some
other
time
.
 
<EOS>
Bear
with
my
folly
,
John
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
just
now
,
like
to
think
or
speak
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
swear
to
you
,
Tom
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
with
great
earnestness
of
manner
,
after
remaining
silent
for
a
few
moments
,
"
that
when
I
see
,
as
I
do
now
,
how
deeply
you
feel
this
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
that
you
have
made
the
discovery
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
reproach
myself
with
the
thought
that
I
ever
jested
on
the
subject
;
I
ought
to
have
known
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
said
Tom
,
extending
his
hand
,
"
it
is
very
generous
and
gallant
in
you
to
receive
me
and
my
disclosure
in
this
spirit
;
it
makes
me
blush
to
think
that
I
should
have
felt
a
moment
's
uneasiness
as
I
came
along
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
think
what
a
weight
is
lifted
off
my
mind
,
"
said
Tom
,
taking
up
his
knife
and
fork
again
,
and
looking
very
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
punish
the
Boar
's
Head
dreadfully
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
host
,
thus
reminded
of
his
duties
,
instantly
betook
himself
to
piling
up
all
kinds
of
irreconcilable
and
contradictory
viands
in
Tom
's
plate
,
and
a
very
capital
breakfast
Tom
made
,
and
very
much
the
better
for
it
<EOS>
Tom
felt
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
right
,
"
said
John
,
after
contemplating
his
visitor
's
proceedings
with
infinite
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
about
our
plans
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
stay
with
me
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
your
box
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
at
the
Inn
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
intend
---
"
   
"
Never
mind
what
you
did
n't
intend
,
"
John
Westlock
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
you
DID
intend
is
more
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
You
intended
,
in
coming
here
,
to
ask
my
advice
,
did
you
not
,
Tom
?
"
   
"
Certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
to
take
it
when
I
gave
it
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
rejoined
Tom
,
smiling
,
"
if
it
were
good
advice
,
<EOS>
which
,
being
yours
,
I
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Then
do
n't
be
an
obstinate
old
humbug
in
the
outset
,
Tom
,
or
I
shall
shut
up
shop
and
dispense
none
of
that
invaluable
commodity
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
on
a
visit
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
an
organ
for
you
,
Tom
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
do
the
gentlemen
downstairs
,
and
the
gentlemen
overhead
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
was
Tom
's
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
you
will
wish
to
see
your
sister
this
morning
,
"
pursued
his
friend
,
"
and
of
course
you
will
like
to
go
there
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
walk
part
of
the
way
with
you
;
and
see
about
a
little
business
of
my
own
,
and
meet
you
here
again
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Put
that
in
your
pocket
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
the
key
of
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
come
home
first
you
'll
want
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
quartering
one
's
self
upon
a
friend
in
this
way
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
are
two
keys
,
"
interposed
John
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
open
the
door
with
them
both
at
once
,
can
I
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
ridiculous
fellow
you
are
,
Tom
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
particular
<EOS>
you
'd
like
for
dinner
,
is
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
then
you
may
as
well
leave
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Have
a
glass
of
cherry
brandy
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
drop
!
 
<EOS>
What
remarkable
chambers
these
are
!
"
said
Pinch
<EOS>
"
there
's
everything
in
'
em
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
soul
,
Tom
,
nothing
but
a
few
little
bachelor
contrivances
!
<EOS>
the
sort
of
impromptu
arrangements
that
might
have
suggested
themselves
to
Philip
Quarll
or
Robinson
Crusoe
,
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
walk
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
John
Westlock
took
the
French
rolls
out
of
his
boots
,
and
put
his
boots
on
,
and
dressed
himself
;
giving
Tom
the
paper
to
read
in
the
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
returned
,
equipped
for
walking
,
he
found
Tom
in
a
brown
study
,
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dreaming
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Pinch
,
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
looking
over
the
advertising
sheet
,
thinking
there
might
be
something
in
it
which
would
be
likely
to
suit
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
often
think
,
the
strange
thing
seems
to
be
that
nobody
is
suited
.
 
<EOS>
Here
are
all
kinds
of
employers
wanting
all
sorts
of
servants
,
and
all
sorts
of
servants
wanting
all
kinds
of
employers
,
and
they
never
seem
to
come
together
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
a
gentleman
in
a
public
office
in
a
position
of
temporary
difficulty
,
who
wants
to
borrow
five
hundred
pounds
;
and
in
the
very
next
advertisement
here
is
another
gentleman
who
has
got
exactly
that
sum
to
lend
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
'll
never
lend
it
to
him
,
John
,
you
'll
find
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
a
lady
possessing
a
moderate
independence
,
who
wants
to
board
and
lodge
with
a
quiet
,
cheerful
family
;
and
here
is
a
family
describing
themselves
in
those
very
words
,
"
a
quiet
,
cheerful
family
,
"
who
want
exactly
such
a
lady
to
come
and
live
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
'll
never
go
,
John
!
 
<EOS>
Neither
do
any
of
these
single
gentlemen
who
want
an
airy
bedroom
,
with
the
occasional
use
of
a
parlour
,
ever
appear
to
come
to
terms
with
these
other
people
who
live
in
a
rural
situation
remarkable
for
its
bracing
atmosphere
,
within
five
minutes
'
walk
of
the
Royal
Exchange
.
 
<EOS>
Even
those
letters
of
the
alphabet
who
are
always
running
away
from
their
friends
and
being
entreated
at
the
tops
of
columns
to
come
back
,
never
DO
come
back
,
if
we
may
judge
from
the
number
of
times
they
are
asked
to
do
it
and
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
It
really
seems
,
"
said
Tom
,
relinquishing
the
paper
with
a
thoughtful
sigh
,
"
as
if
people
had
the
same
gratification
in
printing
their
complaints
as
in
making
them
known
by
word
of
mouth
;
as
if
they
found
it
a
comfort
and
consolation
to
proclaim
<EOS>
"
I
want
such
and
such
a
thing
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
it
,
and
<EOS>
I
do
n't
expect
I
ever
shall
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
John
Westlock
laughed
at
the
idea
,
and
they
went
out
together
.
 
<EOS>
So
many
years
had
passed
since
Tom
was
last
in
London
,
and
he
had
known
so
little
of
it
then
,
that
his
interest
in
all
he
saw
was
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
particularly
anxious
,
among
other
notorious
localities
,
to
have
those
streets
pointed
out
to
him
which
were
appropriated
to
the
slaughter
of
countrymen
;
and
was
quite
disappointed
to
find
,
after
half
-
an
-
hour
's
walking
,
that
he
had
n't
had
his
pocket
picked
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
John
Westlock
's
inventing
a
pickpocket
for
his
gratification
,
and
pointing
out
a
highly
respectable
stranger
as
one
of
that
fraternity
,
he
was
much
delighted
.
   
<EOS>
His
friend
accompanied
him
to
within
a
short
distance
of
Camberwell
and
having
put
him
beyond
the
possibility
of
mistaking
the
wealthy
brass
-
and
-
copper
founder
's
,
left
him
to
make
his
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
before
the
great
bell
-
handle
,
Tom
gave
it
a
gentle
pull
.
 
<EOS>
The
porter
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
does
Miss
Pinch
live
here
?
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Pinch
is
governess
here
,
"
replied
the
porter
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
looked
at
Tom
from
head
to
foot
,
as
if
he
would
have
said
,
"
You
are
a
nice
man
,
YOU
are
;
where
did
YOU
come
from
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
same
young
lady
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
Is
she
at
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
rejoined
the
porter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
you
could
have
the
goodness
to
ascertain
?
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
had
quite
a
delicacy
in
offering
the
suggestion
,
for
the
possibility
of
such
a
step
did
not
appear
to
present
itself
to
the
porter
's
mind
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
The
fact
was
that
the
porter
in
answering
the
gate
-
bell
had
,
according
to
usage
,
rung
the
house
-
bell
(
for
it
is
as
well
to
do
these
things
in
the
Baronial
style
while
you
are
about
it
)
,
and
that
there
the
functions
of
his
office
had
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
Being
hired
to
open
and
shut
the
gate
,
and
not
to
explain
himself
to
strangers
,
he
left
this
little
incident
to
be
developed
by
the
footman
with
the
tags
,
who
,
at
this
juncture
,
called
out
from
the
door
steps
:
   
<EOS>
"
Hollo
,
there
!
<EOS>
wot
are
you
up
to
?
 
<EOS>
This
way
,
young
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Tom
,
hurrying
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
observe
that
there
was
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
is
Miss
Pinch
at
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
IN
,
"
replied
the
footman
.
 
<EOS>
As
much
as
to
say
to
Tom
:
"
But
if
you
think
she
has
anything
to
do
with
the
proprietorship
of
this
place
you
had
better
abandon
that
idea
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
see
her
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
The
footman
,
being
a
lively
young
man
,
happened
to
have
his
attention
caught
at
that
moment
by
the
flight
of
a
pigeon
,
in
which
he
took
so
warm
an
interest
that
his
gaze
was
rivetted
on
the
bird
until
it
was
quite
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
invited
Tom
to
come
in
,
and
showed
him
into
a
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hany
neem
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
young
man
,
pausing
languidly
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
thought
;
because
without
providing
the
stranger
,
in
case
he
should
happen
to
be
of
a
warm
temper
,
<EOS>
with
a
sufficient
excuse
for
knocking
him
down
,
it
implied
this
young
man
's
estimate
of
his
quality
,
and
relieved
his
breast
of
the
oppressive
burden
of
rating
him
in
secret
as
a
nameless
and
obscure
individual
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
her
brother
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
?
"
drawled
the
footman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
repeated
Tom
,
slightly
raising
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
will
say
,
in
the
first
instance
,
a
gentleman
,
and
then
say
her
brother
,
I
shall
be
obliged
to
you
,
as
she
does
not
expect
me
or
know
I
am
in
London
,
and
I
do
not
wish
to
startle
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
man
's
interest
in
Tom
's
observations
had
ceased
long
before
this
time
,
but
he
kindly
waited
until
now
;
when
,
shutting
the
door
,
he
withdrew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
disrespectful
and
uncivil
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
these
are
new
servants
here
,
and
that
Ruth
is
very
differently
treated
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
cogitations
were
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
adjoining
room
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
high
dispute
,
or
in
indignant
reprimand
of
some
offender
;
and
gathering
strength
occasionally
,
broke
out
into
a
perfect
whirlwind
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
one
of
these
gusts
,
as
it
appeared
to
Tom
,
that
the
footman
announced
him
;
for
an
abrupt
and
unnatural
calm
took
place
,
and
then
a
dead
silence
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
standing
before
the
window
,
wondering
what
domestic
quarrel
might
have
caused
these
sounds
,
and
hoping
Ruth
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
his
sister
ran
into
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
looking
at
her
with
great
pride
,
when
they
had
tenderly
embraced
each
other
,
"
how
altered
you
are
Ruth
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
scarcely
have
known
you
,
my
love
,
if
I
had
seen
you
anywhere
else
,
I
declare
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
so
improved
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
inexpressible
delight
;
"
you
are
so
womanly
;
you
are
so
---
<EOS>
positively
,
you
know
,
you
are
so
handsome
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
YOU
think
so
Tom
---
"
   
"
Oh
,
but
everybody
must
think
so
,
you
know
,
"
said
Tom
,
gently
smoothing
down
her
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
matter
of
fact
;
not
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
looking
at
her
more
intently
,
"
how
flushed
you
are
!
<EOS>
and
you
have
been
crying
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
not
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
said
her
brother
stoutly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
story
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
,
dear
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
with
Mr
Pecksniff
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
try
and
settle
myself
in
London
;
and
if
you
are
not
happy
here
(
as
I
very
much
fear
you
are
not
,
for
I
begin
to
think
you
have
been
deceiving
me
with
the
kindest
and
most
affectionate
intention
)
you
shall
not
remain
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Tom
's
blood
was
rising
;
mind
that
!
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
Boar
's
Head
had
something
to
do
with
it
,
but
certainly
the
footman
had
.
 
<EOS>
So
had
the
sight
of
his
pretty
sister
---
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
could
bear
a
good
deal
himself
,
but
he
was
proud
of
her
,
and
pride
is
a
sensitive
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
think
,
"
there
are
more
Pecksniffs
than
one
,
perhaps
,
"
and
by
all
the
pins
and
needles
that
run
up
and
down
in
angry
veins
,
Tom
was
in
a
most
unusual
tingle
all
at
once
!
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
talk
about
it
,
Tom
,
"
said
Ruth
,
giving
him
another
kiss
to
pacify
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
can
not
stay
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
not
!
"
replied
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
you
shall
not
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Heyday
!
<EOS>
You
are
not
an
object
of
charity
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
stopped
in
these
exclamations
by
the
footman
,
who
brought
a
message
from
his
master
,
importing
that
he
wished
to
speak
with
him
before
he
went
,
and
with
Miss
Pinch
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
Show
the
way
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
wait
upon
him
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
entered
the
adjoining
room
from
which
the
noise
of
altercation
had
proceeded
;
and
there
they
found
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
,
with
a
pompous
voice
and
manner
,
and
a
middle
-
aged
lady
,
with
what
may
be
termed
an
excisable
face
,
or
one
in
which
starch
and
vinegar
were
decidedly
employed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
likewise
present
<EOS>
that
eldest
pupil
of
Miss
Pinch
,
whom
Mrs
Todgers
,
on
a
previous
occasion
,
had
called
a
syrup
,
and
who
was
now
weeping
and
sobbing
spitefully
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
brother
,
sir
,
"
said
Ruth
Pinch
,
timidly
presenting
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
the
gentleman
,
surveying
Tom
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
really
are
Miss
Pinch
's
brother
,
I
presume
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
my
asking
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
observe
any
resemblance
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Miss
Pinch
has
a
brother
,
I
know
,
"
observed
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Pinch
is
always
talking
about
her
brother
,
when
she
ought
to
be
engaged
upon
my
education
,
"
sobbed
the
pupil
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sophia
!
 
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
!
"
<EOS>
observed
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
if
you
please
,
"
addressing
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
sat
down
,
looking
from
one
face
to
another
,
in
mute
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Remain
here
,
if
you
please
,
Miss
Pinch
,
"
pursued
the
gentleman
,
looking
slightly
over
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
interrupted
him
here
,
by
rising
to
place
a
chair
for
his
sister
.
<EOS>
Having
done
which
he
sat
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
chance
to
have
called
to
see
your
sister
to
-
day
,
sir
,
"
resumed
the
brass
-
and
-
copper
founder
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
although
I
do
not
approve
,
as
a
principle
,
of
any
young
person
engaged
in
my
family
in
the
capacity
of
a
governess
,
receiving
visitors
,
it
happens
in
this
case
to
be
well
timed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
inform
you
that
we
are
not
at
all
satisfied
with
your
sister
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
very
much
DISsatisfied
with
her
,
"
observed
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
never
say
another
lesson
to
Miss
Pinch
if
I
was
to
be
beat
to
death
for
it
!
"
<EOS>
sobbed
the
pupil
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sophia
!
"
cried
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
inquire
what
your
ground
of
dissatisfaction
is
?
"
asked
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
recognize
it
as
a
right
;
but
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
Your
sister
has
not
the
slightest
innate
power
of
commanding
respect
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
a
constant
source
of
difference
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
Although
she
has
been
in
this
family
for
some
time
,
and
although
the
young
lady
who
is
now
present
has
almost
,
as
it
were
,
grown
up
under
her
tuition
,
that
young
lady
has
no
respect
for
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pinch
has
been
perfectly
unable
to
command
my
daughter
's
respect
,
or
to
win
my
daughter
's
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
allowing
the
palm
of
his
hand
to
fall
gravely
down
upon
the
table
<EOS>
:
"
I
maintain
that
there
is
something
radically
wrong
in
that
!
 
<EOS>
You
,
as
her
brother
,
may
be
disposed
to
deny
it

"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
disposed
to
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
that
there
is
something
radically
wrong
;
radically
monstrous
,
in
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heavens
!
"
cried
the
gentleman
,
looking
round
the
room
with
dignity
,
"
what
do
I
find
to
be
the
case
!
<EOS>
what
results
obtrude
themselves
upon
me
as
flowing
from
this
weakness
of
character
on
the
part
of
Miss
Pinch
!
 
<EOS>
What
are
my
feelings
as
a
father
,
when
,
after
my
desire
(
repeatedly
expressed
to
Miss
Pinch
,
as
I
think
she
will
not
venture
to
deny
)
that
my
daughter
should
be
choice
in
her
expressions
,
genteel
in
her
deportment
,
as
becomes
her
station
in
life
,
and
politely
distant
to
her
inferiors
in
society
,
I
find
her
,
only
this
very
morning
,
addressing
Miss
Pinch
herself
as
a
beggar
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
beggarly
thing
,
"
observed
the
lady
,
in
correction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
is
worse
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
triumphantly
;
"
which
is
worse
.
<EOS>
A
beggarly
thing
.
 
<EOS>
A
low
,
coarse
,
despicable
expression
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Most
despicable
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
that
there
is
a
just
appreciation
of
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
just
,
sir
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
lowering
his
voice
to
be
the
more
impressive
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
just
,
that
,
but
for
my
knowing
Miss
Pinch
to
be
an
unprotected
young
person
,
an
orphan
,
and
without
friends
<EOS>
,
I
would
,
as
I
assured
Miss
Pinch
,
upon
my
veracity
and
personal
character
,
a
few
minutes
ago
,
I
would
have
severed
the
connection
between
us
at
that
moment
and
from
that
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
rising
from
his
seat
;
for
he
was
now
unable
to
contain
himself
any
longer
;
"
do
n't
allow
such
considerations
as
those
to
influence
you
,
pray
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
n't
exist
,
sir

<EOS>
She
is
not
unprotected

<EOS>
She
is
ready
to
depart
this
instant

<EOS>
Ruth

my
dear
,
get
your
bonnet
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

a
pretty
family

"
cried
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
's
her
brother
!
<EOS>
There
's
no
doubt
about
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
little
doubt
,
madam
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
as
that
the
young
lady
yonder
is
the
child
of
your
teaching

not
my

<EOS>
Ruth

my
dear
,
get
your
bonnet
on

"
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
say
,
young
man
,
"
interposed
the
brass
-
and
-
copper
founder
,
haughtily
,
"
with
that
impertinence
which
is
natural
to
you
,
and
which
I
therefore
do
not
condescend
to
notice
further
,
that
the
young
lady
,
my
eldest
daughter
,
has
been
educated
by
any
one
but
Miss
Pinch
,
you
---
I
need
n't
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
You
comprehend
me
fully
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
you
are
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
after
regarding
him
in
silence
for
some
little
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
not
understand
what
I
mean
,
I
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
understand
what
I
mean
,
I
beg
you
not
to
repeat
that
mode
of
expressing
yourself
in
answer
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
meaning
is
,
that
no
man
can
expect
his
children
to
respect
what
he
degrades
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
nt
!
<EOS>
ca
nt
!
 
<EOS>
The
common
ca
nt
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
common
story
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
;
"
the
story
of
a
common
mind
.
<EOS>
Your
governess
can
not
win
the
confidence
and
respect
of
your
children
,
forsooth
!
 
<EOS>
Let
her
begin
by
winning
yours
,
and
see
what
happens
then
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Miss
Pinch
is
getting
her
bonnet
on
,
I
trust
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
trust
she
is
,
"
said
Tom
,
forestalling
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
I
address
myself
to
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
made
your
statement
to
me
,
sir
;
you
required
to
see
me
for
that
purpose
;
and
I
have
a
right
to
answer
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
loud
or
turbulent
,
"
said
Tom
,
which
was
quite
true
,
"
though
I
can
scarcely
say
as
much
for
you
,
in
your
manner
of
addressing
yourself
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
wish
,
on
my
sister
's
behalf
,
to
state
the
simple
truth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
state
anything
you
like
,
young
man
,
"
returned
the
gentleman
,
affecting
to
yawn
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
Miss
Pinch
's
money
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
tell
me
,
"
resumed
Tom
,
who
was
not
the
less
indignant
for
keeping
himself
quiet
,
"
that
my
sister
has
no
innate
power
of
commanding
the
respect
of
your
children
,
I
must
tell
you
it
is
not
so
;
and
that
she
has
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
as
well
bred
,
as
well
taught
,
as
well
qualified
by
nature
to
command
respect
,
<EOS>
as
any
hirer
of
a
governess
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
you
place
her
at
a
disadvantage
in
reference
to
every
servant
in
your
house
,
how
can
you
suppose
,
if
you
have
the
gift
of
common
sense
,
that
she
is
not
in
a
tenfold
worse
position
in
reference
to
your
daughters
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
"
exclaimed
the
gentleman
,
"
this
is
pretty
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
ill
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
bad
and
mean
,
and
wrong
and
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
Respect
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
young
people
are
quick
enough
to
observe
and
imitate
;
and
why
or
how
should
they
respect
whom
no
one
else
respects
,
and
everybody
slights
?
 
<EOS>
And
very
partial
they
must
grow
---
oh
,
very
partial
!
<EOS>
---
to
their
studies
,
when
they
see
to
what
a
pass
proficiency
in
those
same
tasks
has
brought
their
governess
!
 
<EOS>
Respect
!
 
<EOS>
Put
anything
the
most
deserving
of
respect
before
your
daughters
in
the
light
in
which
you
place
her
,
and
you
will
bring
it
down
as
low
,
no
matter
what
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
speak
with
extreme
impertinence
,
young
man
,
"
observed
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
speak
without
passion
,
but
with
extreme
indignation
and
contempt
for
such
a
course
of
treatment
,
and
for
all
who
practice
it
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
can
you
,
as
an
honest
gentleman
,
profess
displeasure
or
surprise
at
your
daughter
telling
my
sister
she
is
something
beggarly
and
humble
,
when
you
are
for
ever
telling
her
the
same
thing
yourself
in
fifty
plain
,
outspeaking
ways
,
though
not
in
words
;
and
when
your
very
porter
and
footman
make
the
same
delicate
announcement
to
all
comers
?
 
<EOS>
As
to
your
suspicion
and
distrust
of
her
;
even
of
her
word
;
if
she
is
not
above
their
reach
,
you
have
no
right
to
employ
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
right
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
brass
-
and
-
copper
founder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Distinctly
not
,
"
Tom
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
imagine
that
the
payment
of
an
annual
sum
of
money
gives
it
to
you
,
you
immensely
exaggerate
its
power
and
value
.
 
<EOS>
Your
money
is
the
least
part
of
your
bargain
in
such
a
case
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
punctual
in
that
to
half
a
second
on
the
clock
,
and
yet
be
Bankrupt
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
"
said
Tom
,
much
flushed
and
flustered
,
now
that
it
was
over
,
"
except
to
crave
permission
to
stand
in
your
garden
until
my
sister
is
ready
.
"
   
<EOS>
Not
waiting
to
obtain
it
,
Tom
walked
out
.
   
<EOS>
Before
he
had
well
begun
to
cool
,
his
sister
joined
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
crying
;
and
Tom
could
not
bear
that
any
one
about
the
house
should
see
her
doing
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
will
think
you
are
sorry
to
go
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
sorry
to
go
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Tom
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
anxious
to
go
for
a
very
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
cry
!
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
sorry
for
YOU
,
dear
,
"
sobbed
Tom
's
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
ought
to
be
glad
on
my
account
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
twice
as
happy
with
you
for
a
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
up
your
head
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
Now
we
go
out
as
we
ought
.
 
<EOS>
Not
blustering
,
you
know
,
but
firm
and
confident
in
ourselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
idea
of
Tom
and
his
sister
blustering
,
under
any
circumstances
,
was
a
splendid
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
But
Tom
was
very
far
from
feeling
it
to
be
<EOS>
so
,
in
his
excitement
;
and
passed
out
at
the
gate
with
such
severe
determination
written
in
his
face
that
the
porter
hardly
knew
him
again
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
they
had
walked
some
short
distance
,
and
Tom
found
himself
getting
cooler
and
more
collected
,
that
he
was
quite
restored
to
himself
by
an
inquiry
from
his
sister
,
who
said
in
her
pleasant
little
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
we
going
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
stopping
,
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
you
---
do
n't
you
live
anywhere
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Tom
's
sister
looking
wistfully
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
Not
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
arrived
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
some
lodgings
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
n't
tell
her
that
he
had
been
going
to
stay
with
his
friend
John
,
and
could
on
no
account
think
of
billeting
two
inmates
upon
him
,
of
whom
one
was
a
young
lady
;
for
he
knew
that
would
make
her
uncomfortable
,
and
would
cause
her
to
regard
herself
as
being
an
inconvenience
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
did
he
like
to
leave
her
anywhere
while
he
called
on
John
,
and
told
him
of
this
change
in
his
arrangements
;
for
he
was
delicate
of
seeming
to
encroach
upon
the
generous
and
hospitable
nature
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
he
said
again
,
"
We
must
have
some
lodgings
,
of
course
;
"
and
said
it
as
stoutly
as
if
he
had
been
a
perfect
Directory
and
Guide
-
Book
to
all
the
lodgings
in
London
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
shall
we
go
and
look
for
'
em
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
sister
was
not
much
wiser
on
such
a
topic
than
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
squeezed
her
little
purse
into
his
coat
-
pocket
,
and
folding
the
little
hand
with
which
she
did
so
on
the
other
little
hand
with
which
she
clasped
his
arm
,
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ought
to
be
a
cheap
neighbourhood
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
and
not
too
far
from
London
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
Should
you
think
Islington
a
good
place
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
was
an
excellent
place
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
used
to
be
called
Merry
Islington
,
once
upon
a
time
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
's
merry
now
;
if
so
,
it
's
all
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
not
too
dear
,
"
said
Tom
's
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
if
it
's
not
too
dear
,
"
assented
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
where
IS
Islington
?
 
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
do
better
than
go
there
,
I
should
think
.
 
<EOS>
Let
's
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
sister
would
have
gone
anywhere
with
him
;
so
they
walked
off
,
arm
in
arm
,
as
comfortably
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
presently
,
that
Islington
was
not
in
that
neighbourhood
,
Tom
made
inquiries
respecting
a
public
conveyance
thither
;
which
they
soon
obtained
.
<EOS>
As
they
rode
along
they
were
very
full
of
conversation
indeed
,
Tom
relating
what
had
happened
to
him
,
and
<EOS>
Tom
's
sister
relating
what
had
happened
to
her
,
and
both
finding
a
great
deal
more
to
say
than
time
to
say
it
in
;
for
they
had
only
just
begun
to
talk
,
in
comparison
with
what
they
had
to
tell
each
other
,
when
they
reached
their
journey
's
end
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
we
must
first
look
out
for
some
very
unpretending
streets
,
and
then
look
out
for
bills
in
the
windows
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
they
walked
off
again
,
quite
as
happily
as
if
they
had
just
stepped
out
of
a
snug
little
house
of
their
own
,
to
look
for
lodgings
on
account
of
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
's
simplicity
was
unabated
,
Heaven
knows
;
but
now
that
he
had
somebody
to
rely
upon
him
,
he
was
stimulated
to
rely
a
little
more
upon
himself
,
and
was
,
in
his
own
opinion
,
quite
a
desperate
fellow
.
   
<EOS>
After
roaming
up
and
down
for
hours
,
looking
at
some
scores
of
lodgings
,
they
began
to
find
it
rather
fatiguing
,
especially
as
they
saw
none
which
were
at
all
adapted
to
their
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
in
a
singular
little
old
-
fashioned
house
,
up
a
blind
street
,
they
discovered
two
small
bedrooms
and
a
triangular
parlour
,
which
promised
to
suit
them
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Their
desiring
to
take
possession
immediately
was
a
suspicious
circumstance
,
but
even
this
was
surmounted
by
the
payment
of
their
first
week
's
rent
,
and
a
reference
to
John
Westlock
,
Esquire
,
Furnival
's
Inn
,
High
Holborn
.
   
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
goodly
sight
,
when
this
important
point
was
settled
,
to
behold
Tom
and
his
sister
trotting
round
to
the
baker
's
,
and
the
butcher
's
,
and
the
grocer
's
,
with
a
kind
of
dreadful
delight
in
the
unaccustomed
cares
of
housekeeping
;
taking
secret
counsel
together
as
they
gave
their
small
orders
,
and
distracted
by
the
least
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
shopkeeper
!
 
<EOS>
When
they
got
back
to
the
triangular
parlour
,
and
Tom
's
sister
,
bustling
to
and
fro
,
busy
about
a
thousand
pleasant
nothings
,
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
give
old
Tom
a
kiss
or
smile
upon
him
,
<EOS>
Tom
rubbed
his
hands
as
if
all
Islington
were
his
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
late
in
the
afternoon
now
,
though
,
and
high
time
for
Tom
to
keep
his
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
after
agreeing
with
his
sister
that
in
consideration
of
not
having
dined
,
they
would
venture
on
the
extravagance
of
chops
for
supper
at
nine
,
he
walked
out
again
to
narrate
these
marvellous
occurrences
to
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
a
family
man
all
at
once
,
"
thought
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
only
get
something
to
do
,
how
comfortable
Ruth
and
<EOS>
I
may
be
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
that
if
!
<EOS>
But
it
's
of
no
use
to
despond
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
but
do
that
,
when
I
have
tried
everything
and
failed
;
and
even
then
it
wo
n't
serve
me
much
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
"
thought
Tom
,
quickening
his
pace
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
John
will
think
has
become
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
begin
to
be
afraid
I
have
strayed
into
one
of
those
streets
where
the
countrymen
are
murdered
;
and
that
I
have
been
made
meat
pies
of
,
or
some
such
horrible
thing
.
"

Chapter

.
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
,
going
astray
,
finds
that
he
is
not
the
only
person
in
that
predicament
.
 
<EOS>
He
retaliates
upon
a
fallen
foe
 
<EOS>
Tom
's
evil
genius
did
not
lead
him
into
the
dens
of
any
of
those
preparers
of
cannibalic
pastry
,
who
are
represented
in
many
standard
country
legends
as
doing
a
lively
retail
business
in
the
Metropolis
;
nor
did
it
mark
him
out
as
the
prey
of
ring
-
droppers
,
pea
and
thimble
-
riggers
,
duffers
,
touters
,
or
any
of
those
bloodless
sharpers
,
who
are
,
perhaps
,
a
little
better
known
to
the
Police
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
into
conversation
with
no
gentleman
who
took
him
into
a
public
-
house
,
where
there
happened
to
be
another
gentleman
who
swore
he
had
more
money
than
any
gentleman
,
and
very
soon
proved
he
had
more
money
than
one
gentleman
by
taking
his
away
from
him
;
neither
did
he
fall
into
any
other
of
the
numerous
man
-
traps
which
are
set
up
without
notice
,
in
the
public
grounds
of
this
city
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
lost
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
very
soon
did
that
;
and
in
trying
to
find
it
again
he
lost
it
more
and
more
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Tom
,
in
his
guileless
distrust
of
London
,
thought
himself
very
knowing
in
coming
to
the
determination
that
he
would
not
ask
to
be
directed
to
Furnival
's
Inn
,
if
he
could
help
it
;
unless
,
indeed
,
he
should
happen
to
find
himself
near
the
Mint
,
or
the
Bank
of
England
;
in
which
case
he
would
step
in
,
and
ask
a
civil
question
or
two
,
confiding
in
the
perfect
respectability
of
the
concern
.
 
<EOS>
So
on
he
went
,
looking
up
all
the
streets
he
came
near
,
and
going
up
half
of
them
;
and
thus
,
by
dint
of
not
being
true
to
Goswell
Street
,
and
filing
off
into
Aldermanbury
,
and
bewildering
himself
in
Barbican
,
and
being
constant
to
the
wrong
point
of
the
compass
in
London
Wall
,
and
then
getting
himself
crosswise
into
Thames
Street
,
by
an
instinct
that
would
have
been
marvellous
if
he
had
had
the
least
desire
or
reason
to
go
there
,
he
found
himself
,
at
last
,
hard
by
the
Monument
.
   
<EOS>
The
Man
in
the
Monument
was
quite
as
mysterious
a
being
to
Tom
as
the
Man
in
the
Moon
.
 
<EOS>
It
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
the
lonely
creature
who
held
himself
aloof
from
all
mankind
in
that
pillar
like
some
old
hermit
was
the
very
man
of
whom
to
ask
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
Cold
,
he
might
be
;
little
sympathy
he
had
,
perhaps
,
with
human
passion
---
the
column
seemed
too
tall
for
that
;
but
if
Truth
did
n't
live
in
the
base
of
the
Monument
,
notwithstanding
Pope
's
couplet
about
the
outside
of
it
,
where
in
London
(
thought
Tom
)
was
she
likely
to
be
found
!
   
<EOS>
Coming
close
below
the
pillar
,
it
was
a
great
encouragement
to
Tom
to
find
that
the
Man
in
the
Monument
had
simple
tastes
;
that
stony
and
artificial
as
his
residence
was
,
he
still
preserved
some
rustic
recollections
;
that
he
liked
plants
,
hung
up
bird
-
cages
,
was
not
wholly
cut
off
from
fresh
groundsel
,
and
kept
young
trees
in
tubs
.
<EOS>
The
Man
in
the
Monument
,
himself
,
was
sitting
outside
the
door
---
his
own
door
:
the
Monument
-
door
:
what
a
grand
idea
!
<EOS>
---
and
was
actually
yawning
,
as
if
there
were
no
Monument
to
stop
his
mouth
,
and
give
him
a
perpetual
interest
in
his
own
existence
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
advancing
towards
this
remarkable
creature
,
to
inquire
the
way
to
Furnival
's
Inn
,
when
two
people
came
to
see
the
Monument
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
;
and
the
gentleman
said
,
"
How
much
a
-
piece
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
Man
in
the
Monument
replied
,
"
A
Tanner
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
low
expression
,
compared
with
the
Monument
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
put
a
shilling
into
his
hand
,
and
the
Man
in
the
Monument
opened
a
dark
little
door
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
gentleman
and
lady
had
passed
out
of
view
,
he
shut
it
again
,
and
came
slowly
back
to
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
He
sat
down
and
laughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
know
what
a
many
steps
there
is
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
worth
twice
the
money
to
stop
here
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
eye
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Man
in
the
Monument
was
a
Cynic
;
a
worldly
man
!
 
<EOS>
Tom
could
n't
ask
his
way
of
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
prepared
to
put
no
confidence
in
anything
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
gracious
!
<EOS>
"
cried
a
well
-
known
voice
behind
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
be
sure
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
was
poked
in
the
back
by
a
parasol
.
 
<EOS>
Turning
round
to
inquire
into
this
salute
,
he
beheld
the
eldest
daughter
of
his
late
patron
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Pecksniff
!
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
goodness
,
Mr
Pinch
!
"
cried
Cherry
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
rather
wandered
from
my
way
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
run
away
,
"
said
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
quite
spirited
and
proper
if
you
had
,
when
my
Papa
so
far
forgets
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
left
him
,
"
returned
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
perfectly
understood
on
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
done
clandestinely
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
married
?
"
asked
Cherry
,
with
a
spasmodic
shake
of
her
chin
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
yet
,
"
said
Tom
,
colouring
;
"
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
think
he
is
likely
to
be
,
if
---
if
Miss
Graham
is
the
object
of
his
passion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tcha
,
Mr
Pinch
!
"
cried
Charity
,
with
sharp
impatience
,
"
you
're
very
easily
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
the
arts
of
which
<EOS>
such
a
creature
is
capable
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
a
wicked
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
married
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tom
hinted
,
to
divert
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
N
---
 
<EOS>
no
!
"
said
Cherry
,
tracing
out
one
particular
paving
-
stone
in
Monument
Yard
with
the
end
of
her
parasol
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
<EOS>
but
really
it
's
quite
impossible
to
explain
.
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
walk
in
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
live
here
,
then
?
"
said
Tom
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
,
pointing
with
her
parasol
to
Todgers
's
;
"
I
reside
with
this
lady
,
AT
PRESENT
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
great
stress
on
the
two
last
words
suggested
to
Tom
that
he
was
expected
to
say
something
in
reference
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
at
present
!
 
<EOS>
Are
you
going
home
again
soon
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
returned
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
A
mother
-
in
-
law
who
is
younger
than
---
<EOS>
I
mean
to
say
,
who
is
as
nearly
as
possible
about
the
same
age
as
one
's
self
,
would
not
quite
suit
my
spirit
.
<EOS>
Not
quite
!
"
said
Cherry
,
with
a
spiteful
shiver
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
from
your
saying
"
at
present
"
"
---
Tom
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
upon
my
word
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
idea
you
would
press
me
so
very
closely
on
the
subject
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Charity
,
blushing
,
"
or
I
should
not
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
allude
to
---
<EOS>
oh
really
!
<EOS>
---
wo
n't
you
walk
in
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
mentioned
,
to
excuse
himself
,
that
he
had
an
appointment
in
Furnival
's
Inn
,
and
that
coming
from
Islington
he
had
taken
a
few
wrong
turnings
,
and
arrived
at
the
Monument
instead
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
simpered
very
much
when
he
asked
her
if
she
knew
the
way
to
Furnival
's
Inn
,
and
at
length
found
courage
to
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
gentleman
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
,
or
at
least
who
is
not
exactly
a
friend
so
much
as
a
sort
of
acquaintance
---
<EOS>
Oh
upon
my
word
,
I
hardly
know
what
I
say
,
Mr
Pinch
;
you
must
n't
suppose
there
is
any
engagement
between
us
;
or
at
least
if
there
is
,
that
it
is
at
all
a
settled
thing
as
yet
---
is
going
to
Furnival
's
Inn
immediately
<EOS>
,
I
believe
upon
a
little
business
,
and
I
am
sure
he
would
be
very
glad
to
accompany
you
,
so
as
to
prevent
your
going
wrong
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
walk
in
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
very
likely
find
my
sister
Merry
here
,
"
she
said
with
a
curious
toss
of
her
head
,
and
anything
but
an
agreeable
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
think
,
I
'll
endeavour
to
find
my
way
alone
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
for
I
fear
she
would
not
be
very
glad
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
That
unfortunate
occurrence
,
in
relation
to
which
you
and
I
had
some
amicable
words
together
,
in
private
,
is
not
likely
to
have
impressed
her
with
any
friendly
feeling
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
Though
it
really
was
not
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
never
heard
of
that
,
you
may
depend
,
"
said
Cherry
,
gathering
up
the
corners
of
her
mouth
,
and
nodding
at
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
far
from
sure
that
she
would
bear
you
any
mighty
ill
will
for
it
,
if
she
had
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
who
was
really
concerned
by
this
insinuation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
,
"
said
Charity
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
not
already
known
what
shocking
things
treachery
and
deceit
are
in
themselves
,
Mr
Pinch
,
I
might
perhaps
have
learnt
it
from
the
success
they
meet
with
---
from
the
success
they
meet
with
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
she
smiled
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
should
scorn
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
walk
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
hidden
here
,
which
piqued
Tom
's
interest
and
troubled
his
tender
heart
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
in
a
moment
's
irresolution
,
he
looked
at
Charity
,
he
could
not
but
observe
a
struggle
in
her
face
between
a
sense
of
triumph
and
a
sense
of
shame
;
nor
could
he
but
remark
<EOS>
how
,
meeting
even
his
eyes
,
which
she
cared
so
little
for
,
she
turned
away
her
own
,
for
all
the
splenetic
defiance
in
her
manner
.
   
<EOS>
An
uneasy
thought
entered
Tom
's
head
;
a
shadowy
misgiving
that
the
altered
relations
between
himself
and
Pecksniff
were
somehow
to
involve
an
altered
knowledge
on
his
part
of
other
people
,
and
were
to
give
him
an
insight
into
much
of
which
he
had
had
no
previous
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
put
no
definite
construction
upon
Charity
's
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
He
certainly
had
no
idea
that
as
he
had
been
the
audience
and
spectator
of
her
mortification
,
she
grasped
with
eager
delight
at
any
opportunity
of
reproaching
her
sister
with
his
presence
in
HER
far
deeper
misery
;
for
he
knew
nothing
of
it
,
and
only
pictured
that
sister
as
the
same
giddy
,
careless
,
trivial
creature
she
always
had
been
,
with
the
same
slight
estimation
of
himself
which
she
had
never
been
at
the
least
pains
to
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
had
merely
a
confused
impression
that
Miss
Pecksniff
was
not
quite
sisterly
or
kind
;
and
being
curious
to
set
it
right
,
accompanied
her
as
she
desired
.
   
<EOS>
The
house
-
door
being
opened
,
she
went
in
before
Tom
,
requesting
him
to
follow
her
;
and
led
the
way
to
the
parlour
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Merry
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
looking
in
,
"
I
am
so
glad
you
have
not
gone
home
.
 
<EOS>
Who
do
you
think
I
have
met
in
the
street
,
and
brought
to
see
you
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pinch
!
 
<EOS>
There
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
ARE
surprised
,
I
am
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
Not
more
surprised
than
Tom
was
,
when
he
looked
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
Not
half
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pinch
has
left
Papa
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Cherry
,
"
and
his
prospects
are
quite
flourishing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
promised
that
Augustus
,
who
is
going
that
way
,
shall
escort
him
to
the
place
he
wants
.
 
<EOS>
Augustus
,
my
child
,
where
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
Miss
Pecksniff
screamed
her
way
out
of
the
parlour
,
calling
on
Augustus
Moddle
to
appear
;
and
left
Tom
Pinch
alone
with
her
sister
.
   
<EOS>
If
she
had
always
been
his
kindest
friend
;
if
she
had
treated
him
through
all
his
servitude
with
such
consideration
as
was
never
yet
received
by
struggling
man
;
if
she
had
lightened
every
moment
of
those
many
years
,
and
had
ever
spared
and
never
wounded
him
;
his
honest
heart
could
not
have
swelled
before
her
with
a
deeper
pity
,
or
a
purer
freedom
from
all
base
remembrance
than
it
did
then
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
gracious
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
really
the
last
person
in
the
world
I
should
have
thought
of
seeing
,
I
am
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
sorry
to
hear
her
speaking
in
her
old
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
expected
that
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
did
not
feel
it
a
contradiction
that
he
should
be
sorry
to
see
her
<EOS>
so
unlike
her
old
self
,
and
sorry
at
the
same
time
to
hear
her
speaking
in
her
old
manner
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
things
seemed
quite
natural
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
find
any
gratification
in
coming
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
what
put
it
in
your
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
had
much
in
seeing
you
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
love
lost
between
us
,
Mr
Pinch
,
at
any
time
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Her
bonnet
lay
beside
her
on
the
sofa
,
and
she
was
very
busy
with
the
ribbons
as
she
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
Much
too
busy
to
be
conscious
of
the
work
her
fingers
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
never
quarrelled
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
---
Tom
was
right
in
that
,
for
one
person
can
no
more
quarrel
without
an
adversary
,
than
one
person
can
play
at
chess
,
or
fight
a
duel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hoped
you
would
be
glad
to
shake
hands
with
an
old
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
us
rake
up
bygones
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
ever
offended
you
,
forgive
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
;
dropped
her
bonnet
from
her
hands
;
spread
them
before
her
altered
face
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
Pinch
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
although
I
never
used
you
well
,
I
did
believe
your
nature
was
forgiving
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
you
could
be
cruel
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
spoke
as
little
like
her
old
self
now
,
for
certain
,
as
Tom
could
possibly
have
wished
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
seemed
to
be
appealing
to
him
reproachfully
,
and
he
did
not
understand
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
seldom
showed
it
---
never
---
I
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
that
belief
in
you
,
that
if
I
had
been
asked
to
name
the
person
in
the
world
least
likely
to
retort
upon
me
,
I
would
have
named
you
,
confidently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
have
named
me
!
"
<EOS>
Tom
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
with
energy
,
"
and
I
have
often
thought
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
reflection
,
Tom
sat
himself
upon
a
chair
beside
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
believe
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
<EOS>
oh
,
can
you
think
,
that
what
I
said
just
now
,
I
said
with
any
but
the
true
and
plain
intention
which
my
words
professed
?
 
<EOS>
I
mean
it
,
in
the
spirit
and
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
ever
offended
you
,
forgive
me
;
I
may
have
done
so
,
many
times
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
injured
or
offended
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
then
,
could
I
possibly
retort
,
if
even
I
were
stern
and
bad
enough
to
wish
to
do
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
little
while
she
thanked
him
,
through
her
tears
and
sobs
,
and
told
him
she
had
never
been
at
once
so
sorry
and
so
comforted
,
since
she
left
home
.
 
<EOS>
Still
she
wept
bitterly
;
and
it
was
the
greater
pain
to
Tom
to
see
her
weeping
,
from
her
standing
in
especial
need
,
just
then
,
of
sympathy
and
tenderness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
"
you
used
to
be
as
cheerful
as
the
day
was
long
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
used
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
in
such
a
tone
as
rent
Tom
's
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
will
be
again
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
never
more
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
never
,
never
more
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
talk
with
old
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
at
any
time
,
"
she
added
,
looking
hurriedly
into
his
face
---
"
<EOS>
I
sometimes
thought
he
liked
you
,
but
suppressed
it
---
will
you
promise
me
to
tell
him
that
you
saw
me
here
,
and
that
I
said
I
bore
in
mind
the
time
we
talked
together
in
the
churchyard
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
promised
that
he
would
.
   
<EOS>
"
Many
times
since
then
,
when
I
have
wished
I
had
been
carried
there
before
that
day
,
I
have
recalled
his
words
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
that
he
should
know
how
true
they
were
,
although
the
least
acknowledgment
to
that
effect
has
never
passed
my
lips
and
never
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
promised
this
,
conditionally
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
tell
her
how
improbable
it
was
that
he
and
the
old
man
would
ever
meet
again
,
because
he
thought
it
might
disturb
her
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
should
ever
know
this
,
through
your
means
,
dear
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Mercy
,
"
tell
him
that
I
sent
the
message
,
not
for
myself
,
but
that
he
might
be
more
forbearing
and
more
patient
,
and
more
trustful
to
some
other
person
,
in
some
other
time
of
need
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
if
he
could
know
how
my
heart
trembled
in
the
balance
that
day
,
and
what
a
very
little
would
have
turned
the
scale
,
his
own
would
bleed
with
pity
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
appeared
to
him
the
most
unworthy
of
his
help
,
I
was
---
I
know
I
was
,
for
I
have
often
,
often
,
thought
about
it
since
---
the
most
inclined
to
yield
to
what
he
showed
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
he
had
relented
but
a
little
more
;
if
he
had
thrown
himself
in
my
way
for
but
one
other
quarter
of
an
hour
;
if
he
had
extended
his
compassion
for
a
vain
,
unthinking
,
miserable
girl
,
in
but
the
least
degree
;
he
might
,
and
I
believe
he
would
,
have
saved
her
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
I
do
n't
blame
him
,
but
am
grateful
for
the
effort
that
he
made
;
but
ask
him
for
the
love
of
God
,
and
youth
,
and
in
merciful
consideration
for
the
struggle
which
an
ill
-
advised
and
unwakened
nature
makes
to
hide
the
strength
it
thinks
its
weakness
---
ask
him
never
,
never
,
to
forget
this
,
when
he
deals
with
one
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
Although
Tom
did
not
hold
the
clue
to
her
full
meaning
,
he
could
guess
it
pretty
nearly
.
 
<EOS>
Touched
to
the
quick
,
he
took
her
hand
and
said
,
or
meant
to
say
,
some
words
of
consolation
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
and
understood
them
,
whether
they
were
spoken
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
quite
certain
,
afterwards
,
but
that
she
had
tried
to
kneel
down
at
his
feet
,
and
bless
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
found
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
room
when
she
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
was
there
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
had
never
seen
Mrs
Todgers
,
it
is
needless
to
say
,
but
he
had
a
perception
of
her
being
the
lady
of
the
house
;
and
he
saw
some
genuine
compassion
in
her
eyes
,
that
won
his
good
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
an
old
friend
,
I
see
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
"
quoth
Mrs
Todgers
,
shutting
the
door
softly
<EOS>
,
"
she
has
n't
told
you
what
her
troubles
are
,
I
'm
certain
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
struck
by
these
words
,
for
they
were
quite
true
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
he
said
,
"
she
has
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
never
would
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
if
you
saw
her
daily
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
makes
the
least
complaint
to
me
,
or
utters
a
single
word
of
explanation
or
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
drawing
in
her
breath
,
"
I
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
nodded
sorrowfully
,
"
So
do
I.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fully
believe
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
taking
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
from
the
flat
reticule
,
"
that
nobody
can
tell
one
half
of
what
that
poor
young
creature
has
to
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
she
comes
here
,
constantly
,
to
ease
her
poor
full
heart
without
his
knowing
it
;
and
saying
,
"
Mrs
Todgers
,
I
am
very
low
to
-
day
;
I
think
that
I
shall
soon
be
dead
,
"
sits
crying
in
my
room
until
the
fit
is
past
;
I
know
no
more
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
putting
back
her
handkerchief
again
,
"
that
she
considers
me
a
good
friend
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
might
have
said
her
best
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Commercial
gentlemen
and
gravy
had
tried
Mrs
Todgers
's
temper
;
the
main
chance
---
it
was
such
a
very
small
one
in
her
case
,
that
she
might
have
been
excused
for
looking
sharp
after
it
,
lest
it
should
entirely
vanish
from
her
sight
---
had
taken
a
firm
hold
on
Mrs
Todgers
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
some
odd
nook
in
Mrs
Todgers
's
breast
,
up
a
great
many
steps
,
and
in
a
corner
easy
to
be
overlooked
,
there
was
a
secret
door
,
with
"
Woman
"
written
on
the
spring
,
which
,
at
a
touch
from
Mercy
's
hand
,
had
flown
wide
open
,
and
admitted
her
for
shelter
.
   
<EOS>
When
boarding
-
house
accounts
are
balanced
with
all
other
ledgers
,
and
the
books
of
the
Recording
Angel
are
made
up
for
ever
,
perhaps
there
may
be
seen
an
entry
to
thy
credit
,
lean
Mrs
Todgers
,
which
shall
make
thee
beautiful
!
   
<EOS>
She
was
growing
beautiful
so
rapidly
in
Tom
's
eyes
;
for
he
saw
that
she
was
poor
,
and
that
this
good
had
sprung
up
in
her
from
among
the
sordid
strivings
of
her
life
;
that
she
might
have
been
a
very
Venus
in
a
minute
more
,
if
Miss
Pecksniff
had
not
entered
with
her
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Thomas
Pinch
!
<EOS>
"
said
Charity
,
performing
the
ceremony
of
introduction
with
evident
pride
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Moddle
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
my
sister
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gone
,
Miss
Pecksniff
,
"
Mrs
Todgers
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
had
appointed
to
be
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Charity
,
looking
at
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
greatly
altered
since
she
's
been
Anoth
---
since
she
's
been
married
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
"
<EOS>
observed
Moddle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Augustus
!
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
verily
believe
you
have
said
that
fifty
thousand
times
,
in
my
hearing
.
<EOS>
What
a
Prose
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
succeeded
by
some
trifling
love
passages
,
which
appeared
to
originate
with
,
if
not
to
be
wholly
carried
on
by
Miss
Pecksniff
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
Mr
Moddle
was
much
slower
in
his
responses
than
is
customary
with
young
lovers
,
and
exhibited
a
lowness
of
spirits
which
was
quite
oppressive
.
   
<EOS>
He
did
not
improve
at
all
when
Tom
and
he
were
in
the
streets
,
but
sighed
so
dismally
that
it
was
dreadful
to
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
means
of
cheering
him
up
,
Tom
told
him
that
he
wished
him
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Joy
!
"
cried
Moddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha

"
   
"
What
an
extraordinary
young
man
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Scorner
has
not
set
his
seal
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
YOU
care
what
becomes
of
you
?
"
said
Moddle
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
admitted
that
it
was
a
subject
in
which
he
certainly
felt
some
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Moddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Elements
may
have
me
when
they
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
ready
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
inferred
from
these
,
and
other
expressions
of
the
same
nature
,
that
he
was
jealous
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
he
allowed
him
to
take
his
own
course
;
which
was
such
a
gloomy
one
,
that
he
felt
a
load
removed
from
his
mind
when
they
parted
company
at
the
gate
of
Furnival
's
Inn
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
now
a
couple
of
hours
past
John
Westlock
's
dinner
-
time
;
and
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
,
quite
anxious
for
Tom
's
safety
.
<EOS>
The
table
was
spread
;
the
wine
was
carefully
decanted
;
and
the
dinner
smelt
delicious
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Tom
,
old
boy
,
where
on
earth
have
you
been
?
 
<EOS>
Your
box
is
here
.
<EOS>
Get
your
boots
off
instantly
,
and
sit
down
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
I
ca
n't
stay
,
John
,
"
replied
Tom
Pinch
,
who
was
breathless
with
the
haste
he
had
made
in
running
up
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
stay
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
go
on
with
your
dinner
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
my
reason
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
n't
eat
myself
,
or
I
shall
have
no
appetite
for
the
chops
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
no
chops
here
,
my
food
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
are
at
Islington
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
was
perfectly
confounded
by
this
reply
,
and
vowed
he
would
not
touch
a
morsel
until
Tom
had
explained
himself
fully
.
 
<EOS>
So
Tom
sat
down
,
and
told
him
all
;
to
which
he
listened
with
the
greatest
interest
.
   
<EOS>
He
knew
Tom
too
well
,
and
respected
his
delicacy
too
much
,
to
ask
him
why
he
had
taken
these
measures
without
communicating
with
him
first
.
 
<EOS>
He
quite
concurred
in
the
expediency
of
Tom
's
immediately
returning
to
his
sister
,
as
he
knew
so
little
of
the
place
in
which
he
had
left
her
,
and
good
-
humouredly
proposed
to
ride
back
with
him
in
a
cab
,
in
which
he
might
convey
his
box
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
's
proposition
that
he
should
sup
with
them
that
night
<EOS>
,
he
flatly
rejected
,
but
made
an
appointment
with
him
for
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
Tom
,
"
he
said
,
as
they
rode
along
,
"
I
have
a
question
to
ask
you
to
which
I
expect
a
manly
and
straightforward
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
want
any
money
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
pretty
sure
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
indeed
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
are
deceiving
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
With
many
thanks
to
you
,
I
am
quite
in
earnest
,
"
Tom
replied
.
<EOS>
"
My
sister
has
some
money
,
and
so
have
I.
 
If
I
had
nothing
else
,
John
,
I
have
a
five
-
pound
note
,
which
that
good
creature
,
Mrs
Lupin
,
of
the
Dragon
,
handed
up
to
me
outside
the
coach
,
in
a
letter
begging
me
to
borrow
it
;
and
then
drove
off
as
hard
as
she
could
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
blessing
on
every
dimple
in
her
handsome
face
,
say
I
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
,
"
though
why
you
should
give
her
the
preference
over
me
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
bide
my
time
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
'll
continue
to
bide
it
,
"
returned
Tom
,
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
I
owe
you
more
,
already
,
in
a
hundred
other
ways
,
than
I
can
ever
hope
to
pay
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
parted
at
the
door
of
Tom
's
new
residence
.
 
<EOS>
John
Westlock
,
sitting
in
the
cab
,
and
,
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
blooming
little
busy
creature
darting
out
to
kiss
Tom
and
to
help
him
with
his
box
,
would
not
have
had
the
least
objection
to
change
places
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
she
WAS
a
cheerful
little
thing
;
and
had
a
quaint
,
bright
quietness
about
her
that
was
infinitely
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
she
was
the
best
sauce
for
chops
ever
invented
.
 
<EOS>
The
potatoes
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
sending
up
their
grateful
steam
before
her
;
the
froth
upon
the
pint
of
porter
pouted
to
attract
her
notice
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
all
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
nothing
but
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
was
the
first
and
last
thing
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
As
she
sat
opposite
to
Tom
at
supper
,
fingering
one
of
Tom
's
pet
tunes
upon
the
table
-
cloth
,
and
smiling
in
his
face
,
he
had
never
been
so
happy
in
his
life
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Secret
service
 
<EOS>
In
walking
from
the
city
with
his
sentimental
friend
,
Tom
Pinch
had
looked
into
the
face
,
and
brushed
against
the
threadbare
sleeve
,
of
Mr
Nadgett
,
man
of
mystery
to
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
Company
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
naturally
passed
away
from
Tom
's
remembrance
as
he
passed
out
of
his
view
;
for
he
did
n't
know
him
,
and
had
never
heard
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
As
there
are
a
vast
number
of
people
in
the
huge
metropolis
of
England
who
rise
up
every
morning
not
knowing
where
their
heads
will
rest
at
night
,
so
there
are
a
multitude
who
shooting
arrows
over
houses
as
their
daily
business
,
never
know
on
whom
they
fall
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
might
have
passed
Tom
Pinch
ten
thousand
times
;
might
even
have
been
quite
familiar
with
his
face
,
his
name
,
pursuits
,
and
character
;
yet
never
once
have
dreamed
that
Tom
had
any
interest
in
any
act
or
mystery
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
might
have
done
the
like
by
him
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
same
private
man
out
of
all
the
men
alive
,
was
in
the
mind
of
each
at
the
same
moment
;
was
prominently
connected
though
in
a
different
manner
,
with
the
day
's
adventures
of
both
;
and
formed
,
when
they
passed
each
other
in
the
street
,
the
one
absorbing
topic
of
their
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
Why
Tom
had
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
in
his
mind
requires
no
explanation
.
<EOS>
Why
Mr
Nadgett
should
have
had
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
in
his
,
is
quite
another
thing
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
somehow
or
other
,
that
amiable
and
worthy
orphan
had
become
a
part
of
the
mystery
of
Mr
Nadgett
's
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
took
an
interest
in
his
lightest
proceedings
;
and
it
never
flagged
or
wavered
.
 
<EOS>
He
watched
him
in
and
out
of
the
Assurance
Office
,
where
he
was
now
formally
installed
as
a
Director
;
he
dogged
his
footsteps
in
the
streets
;
he
stood
listening
when
he
talked
;
he
sat
in
coffee
-
rooms
entering
his
name
in
the
great
pocket
-
book
,
over
and
over
again
;
he
wrote
letters
to
himself
about
him
constantly
;
and
,
when
he
found
them
in
his
pocket
,
put
them
in
the
fire
,
with
such
distrust
and
caution
that
he
would
bend
down
to
watch
the
crumpled
tinder
while
it
floated
upwards
,
as
if
his
mind
misgave
him
,
that
the
mystery
it
had
contained
might
come
out
at
the
chimney
-
pot
.
   
<EOS>
And
yet
all
this
was
quite
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
kept
it
to
himself
,
and
kept
it
close
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
had
no
more
idea
that
Mr
Nadgett
's
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
,
than
he
had
that
he
was
living
under
the
daily
inspection
and
report
of
a
whole
order
of
Jesuits
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
Mr
Nadgett
's
eyes
were
seldom
fixed
on
any
other
objects
than
the
ground
,
the
clock
,
or
the
fire
;
but
every
button
on
his
coat
might
have
been
an
eye
,
he
saw
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
The
secret
manner
of
the
man
disarmed
suspicion
in
this
wise
;
suggesting
,
not
that
he
was
watching
any
one
,
but
that
he
thought
some
other
man
was
watching
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
about
so
stealthily
,
and
kept
himself
so
wrapped
up
in
himself
,
that
the
whole
object
of
his
life
appeared
to
be
,
to
avoid
notice
and
preserve
his
own
mystery
.
<EOS>
Jonas
sometimes
saw
him
in
the
street
,
hovering
in
the
outer
office
,
waiting
at
the
door
for
the
man
who
never
came
,
or
slinking
off
with
his
immovable
face
and
drooping
head
,
and
the
one
beaver
glove
dangling
before
him
;
but
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
the
cross
upon
the
top
of
St.
Paul
's
Cathedral
taking
note
of
what
he
did
,
or
slowly
winding
a
great
net
about
his
feet
,
as
of
Nadgett
's
being
engaged
in
such
an
occupation
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
made
a
mysterious
change
about
this
time
in
his
mysterious
life
:
for
whereas
he
had
,
until
now
,
been
first
seen
every
morning
coming
down
Cornhill
,
so
exactly
like
the
Nadgett
of
the
day
before
as
to
occasion
a
popular
belief
that
he
never
went
to
bed
or
took
his
clothes
off
,
he
was
now
first
seen
in
Holborn
,
coming
out
of
Kingsgate
Street
;
and
it
was
soon
discovered
that
he
actually
went
every
morning
to
a
barber
's
shop
in
that
street
to
get
shaved
;
and
that
the
barber
's
name
was
Sweedlepipe
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
make
appointments
with
the
man
who
never
came
,
to
meet
him
at
this
barber
's
;
for
he
would
frequently
take
long
spells
of
waiting
in
the
shop
,
and
would
ask
for
pen
and
ink
,
and
pull
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
be
very
busy
over
it
for
an
hour
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
and
Mr
Sweedlepipe
had
many
deep
discoursings
on
the
subject
of
this
mysterious
customer
;
but
they
usually
agreed
that
he
had
speculated
too
much
and
was
keeping
out
of
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
He
must
have
appointed
the
man
who
never
kept
his
word
,
to
meet
him
at
another
new
place
too
;
for
one
day
he
was
found
,
for
the
first
time
,
by
the
waiter
at
the
Mourning
Coach
-
Horse
,
the
House
-
of
-
call
for
Undertakers
,
down
in
the
City
there
,
making
figures
with
a
pipe
-
stem
in
the
sawdust
of
a
clean
spittoon
;
and
declining
to
call
for
anything
,
on
the
ground
of
expecting
a
gentleman
presently
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
gentleman
was
not
honourable
enough
to
keep
his
engagement
,
he
came
again
next
day
,
with
his
pocket
-
book
in
such
a
state
of
distention
that
he
was
regarded
in
the
bar
as
a
man
of
large
property
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
repeated
his
visits
every
day
,
and
had
so
much
writing
to
do
,
that
he
made
nothing
of
emptying
a
capacious
leaden
inkstand
in
two
sittings
.
 
<EOS>
Although
he
never
talked
much
,
still
,
by
being
there
among
the
regular
customers
,
he
made
their
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
course
of
time
became
quite
intimate
with
Mr
Tacker
,
Mr
Mould
's
foreman
;
and
even
with
Mr
Mould
himself
,
who
openly
said
he
was
a
long
-
headed
man
,
a
dry
one
,
a
salt
fish
,
a
deep
file
,
a
rasper
;
and
made
him
the
subject
of
many
other
flattering
encomiums
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
too
,
he
told
the
people
at
the
Assurance
Office
,
in
his
own
mysterious
way
,
that
there
was
something
wrong
(
secretly
wrong
,
of
course
)
in
his
liver
,
and
that
he
feared
he
must
put
himself
under
the
doctor
's
hands
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
delivered
over
to
Jobling
upon
this
representation
;
and
though
Jobling
could
not
find
out
where
his
liver
was
wrong
,
wrong
Mr
Nadgett
said
it
was
;
observing
that
it
was
his
own
liver
,
and
he
hoped
he
ought
to
know
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
became
Mr
Jobling
's
patient
;
and
detailing
his
symptoms
in
his
slow
and
secret
way
,
was
in
and
out
of
that
gentleman
's
room
a
dozen
times
a
day
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
pursued
all
these
occupations
at
once
;
and
all
steadily
;
and
all
secretly
;
and
never
slackened
in
his
watchfulness
of
everything
that
Mr
Jonas
said
and
did
,
and
left
unsaid
and
undone
;
it
is
not
improbable
that
they
were
,
secretly
,
essential
parts
of
some
great
scheme
which
Mr
Nadgett
had
on
foot
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
morning
of
this
very
day
on
which
so
much
had
happened
to
Tom
Pinch
,
that
Nadgett
suddenly
appeared
before
Mr
Montague
's
house
in
Pall
Mall
<EOS>
---
he
always
made
his
appearance
as
if
he
had
that
moment
come
up
a
trap
---
when
the
clocks
were
striking
nine
.
 
<EOS>
He
rang
the
bell
in
a
covert
under
-
handed
way
,
as
though
it
were
a
treasonable
act
;
and
passed
in
at
the
door
,
the
moment
it
was
opened
wide
enough
to
receive
his
body
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
shut
it
immediately
with
his
own
hands
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
,
taking
up
his
name
without
delay
,
returned
with
a
request
that
he
would
follow
him
into
his
master
's
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
The
chairman
of
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
Board
was
dressing
,
and
received
him
as
a
business
person
who
was
often
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
was
received
at
all
times
for
his
business
'
sake
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Nadgett
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
put
his
hat
upon
the
ground
and
coughed
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
having
withdrawn
and
shut
the
door
,
he
went
to
it
softly
,
examined
the
handle
,
and
returned
to
within
a
pace
or
two
of
the
chair
in
which
Mr
Montague
sat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Any
news
,
Mr
Nadgett
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
have
some
news
at
last
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
fear
you
were
off
the
scent
,
Mr
Nadgett
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
grows
cold
occasionally
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
help
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
truth
itself
,
Mr
Nadgett
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
report
a
great
success
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
depends
upon
your
judgment
and
construction
of
it
,
"
was
his
answer
,
as
he
put
on
his
spectacles
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
it
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
pleased
yourself
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
rubbed
his
hands
slowly
,
stroked
his
chin
,
looked
round
the
room
,
and
said
,
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
think
it
's
a
good
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
disposed
to
think
it
's
a
good
case
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
go
into
it
at
once
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
.
"
   
Mr
Nadgett
picked
out
a
certain
chair
from
among
the
rest
,
and
having
planted
it
in
a
particular
spot
,
as
carefully
as
if
he
had
been
going
to
vault
over
it
,
placed
another
chair
in
front
of
it
;
leaving
room
for
his
own
legs
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
sat
down
in
chair
number
two
,
and
laid
his
pocket
-
book
,
very
carefully
,
on
chair
number
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
untied
the
pocket
-
book
,
and
hung
the
string
over
the
back
of
chair
number
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
drew
both
the
chairs
a
little
nearer
Mr
Montague
,
and
opening
the
pocket
-
book
spread
out
its
contents
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
he
selected
a
certain
memorandum
from
the
rest
,
and
held
it
out
to
his
employer
,
who
,
during
the
whole
of
these
preliminary
ceremonies
,
had
been
making
violent
efforts
to
conceal
his
impatience
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
n't
be
so
fond
of
making
notes
,
my
excellent
friend
,
"
said
Tigg
Montague
with
a
ghastly
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
consent
to
give
me
their
purport
by
word
of
mouth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
word
of
mouth
,
"
said
Mr
Nadgett
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
never
know
who
's
listening
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
was
going
to
retort
,
when
Nadgett
handed
him
the
paper
,
and
said
,
with
quiet
exultation
in
his
tone
,
"
We
'll
begin
at
the
beginning
,
and
take
that
one
first
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
chairman
cast
his
eyes
upon
it
,
coldly
,
and
with
a
smile
which
did
not
render
any
great
homage
to
the
slow
and
methodical
habits
of
his
spy
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
read
half
-
a
-
dozen
lines
when
the
expression
of
his
face
began
to
change
,
and
before
he
had
finished
the
perusal
of
the
paper
,
it
was
full
of
grave
and
serious
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
Number
Two
,
"
said
Mr
Nadgett
,
handing
him
another
,
and
receiving
back
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
"
Read
Number
Two
,
sir
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
more
interest
as
you
go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tigg
Montague
leaned
backward
in
his
chair
,
and
cast
upon
his
emissary
such
a
look
of
vacant
wonder
(
not
unmingled
with
alarm
)
,
that
Mr
Nadgett
considered
it
necessary
to
repeat
the
request
he
had
already
twice
preferred
;
with
the
view
to
recalling
his
attention
to
the
point
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Profiting
by
the
hint
,
Mr
Montague
went
on
with
Number
Two
,
and
afterwards
with
Numbers
Three
,
and
Four
,
and
Five
,
and
so
on
.
   
<EOS>
These
documents
were
all
in
Mr
Nadgett
's
writing
,
and
were
apparently
a
series
of
memoranda
,
jotted
down
from
time
to
time
upon
the
backs
of
old
letters
,
or
any
scrap
of
paper
that
came
first
to
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Loose
straggling
scrawls
they
were
,
and
of
very
uninviting
exterior
;
but
they
had
weighty
purpose
in
them
,
if
the
chairman
's
face
were
any
index
to
the
character
of
their
contents
.
   
<EOS>
The
progress
of
Mr
Nadgett
's
secret
satisfaction
arising
out
of
the
effect
they
made
,
kept
pace
with
the
emotions
of
the
reader
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
Mr
Nadgett
sat
with
his
spectacles
low
down
upon
his
nose
,
looking
over
them
at
his
employer
,
and
nervously
rubbing
his
hands
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
while
,
he
changed
his
posture
in
his
chair
for
one
of
greater
ease
,
and
leisurely
perused
the
next
document
he
held
ready
as
if
an
occasional
glance
at
his
employer
's
face
were
now
enough
and
all
occasion
for
anxiety
or
doubt
were
gone
.
 
<EOS>
And
finally
he
rose
and
looked
out
of
the
window
,
where
he
stood
with
a
triumphant
air
until
Tigg
Montague
had
finished
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
this
is
the
last
,
Mr
Nadgett
!
<EOS>
"
said
that
gentleman
,
drawing
a
long
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
sir
,
is
the
last
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
wonderful
man
,
Mr
Nadgett
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
a
pretty
good
case
,
"
he
returned
as
he
gathered
up
his
papers
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
cost
some
trouble
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
trouble
shall
be
well
rewarded
,
Mr
Nadgett
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nadgett
bowed
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
deeper
impression
of
Somebody
's
Hoof
here
,
than
I
had
expected
,
Mr
Nadgett
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
congratulate
myself
upon
your
being
such
a
good
hand
at
a
secret
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
nothing
has
an
interest
to
me
that
's
not
a
secret
,
"
replied
Nadgett
,
as
he
tied
the
string
about
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
put
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
It
always
takes
away
any
pleasure
I
may
have
had
in
this
inquiry
even
to
make
it
known
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
most
invaluable
constitution
,
"
Tigg
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
great
gift
for
a
gentleman
employed
as
you
are
,
Mr
Nadgett
.
 
<EOS>
Much
better
than
discretion
;
though
you
possess
that
quality
also
in
an
eminent
degree
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
heard
a
double
knock
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
put
your
head
out
of
window
,
and
tell
me
whether
there
is
anybody
at
the
door
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
softly
raised
the
sash
,
and
peered
out
from
the
very
corner
,
as
a
man
might
who
was
looking
down
into
a
street
from
whence
a
brisk
discharge
of
musketry
might
be
expected
at
any
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Drawing
in
his
head
with
equal
caution
,
he
observed
,
not
altering
his
voice
or
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
,
"
Tigg
retorted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
had
better
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
though
!
 
<EOS>
No
!
remain
here
,
Mr
Nadgett
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
how
pale
and
flurried
he
had
become
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
account
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
had
fallen
on
his
razors
;
but
what
of
them
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
was
announced
.
   
<EOS>
"
Show
him
up
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Nadgett
!
<EOS>
do
n't
you
leave
us
alone
together
.
<EOS>
Mind
you
do
n't
,
now
!
 
<EOS>
By
the
Lord
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
in
a
whisper
to
himself
:
"
We
do
n't
know
what
may
happen
.
"
   
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
he
hurriedly
took
up
a
couple
of
hair
-
brushes
,
and
began
to
exercise
them
on
his
own
head
,
as
if
his
toilet
had
not
been
interrupted
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
withdrew
to
the
stove
,
in
which
there
was
a
small
fire
for
the
convenience
of
heating
curling
-
irons
;
and
taking
advantage
of
so
favourable
an
opportunity
for
drying
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
produced
it
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
stood
,
during
the
whole
interview
,
holding
it
before
the
bars
,
and
sometimes
,
but
not
often
,
glancing
over
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Chuzzlewit
!
"
cried
Montague
,
as
Jonas
entered
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
rise
with
the
lark
.
 
<EOS>
Though
you
go
to
bed
with
the
nightingale
,
you
rise
with
the
lark
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
superhuman
energy
,
my
dear
Chuzzlewit
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
<EOS>
"
said
Jonas
,
with
an
air
of
langour
and
ill
-
humour
,
as
he
took
a
chair
,
"
I
should
be
very
glad
not
to
get
up
with
the
lark
,
if
I
could
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
a
light
sleeper
;
and
it
's
better
to
be
up
than
lying
awake
,
counting
the
dismal
old
church
-
clocks
,
in
bed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
light
sleeper
!
"
cried
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
is
a
light
sleeper
?
<EOS>
I
often
hear
the
expression
,
but
upon
my
life
I
have
not
the
least
conception
what
a
light
sleeper
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
said
Jonas
,
"
<EOS>
Who
's
that
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
old
what's
-
his
-
name
:
looking
(
as
usual
)
as
if
he
wanted
to
skulk
up
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
not
wanted
here
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
go
,
may
n't
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
him
stay
,
let
him
stay
!
"
said
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
mere
piece
of
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
making
his
report
,
and
is
waiting
for
further
orders
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
told
,
"
said
Tigg
,
raising
his
voice
,
"
not
to
lose
sight
of
certain
friends
of
ours
,
or
to
think
that
he
has
done
with
them
by
any
means
.
 
<EOS>
He
understands
his
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
need
,
"
replied
Jonas
;
"
for
of
all
the
precious
old
dummies
in
appearance
that
I
ever
saw
,
he
's
about
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
afraid
of
me
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
belief
,
"
said
Tigg
,
"
that
you
are
Poison
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nadgett
!
<EOS>
give
me
that
towel
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
as
little
occasion
for
a
towel
as
Jonas
had
for
a
start
.
 
<EOS>
But
Nadgett
brought
it
quickly
;
and
,
having
lingered
for
a
moment
,
fell
back
upon
his
old
post
by
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
resumed
Tigg
,
"
you
are
too
---
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
with
your
lips
?
 
<EOS>
How
white
they
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
took
some
vinegar
just
now
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
oysters
for
my
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Where
are
they
white
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
muttering
an
oath
,
and
rubbing
them
upon
his
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
they
ARE
white
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
look
again
,
they
are
not
,
"
replied
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
coming
right
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
what
you
were
going
to
say
,
"
cried
Jonas
angrily
,
"
and
let
my
face
be
!
 
<EOS>
As
long
as
I
can
show
my
teeth
when
I
want
to
<EOS>
(
and
I
can
do
that
pretty
well
)
,
the
colour
of
my
lips
is
not
material
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
"
said
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
going
to
say
that
you
are
too
quick
and
active
for
our
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
too
shy
to
cope
with
such
a
man
as
you
,
but
does
his
duty
well
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
very
well
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
is
a
light
sleeper
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hang
a
light
sleeper
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jonas
pettishly
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
interrupted
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
light
sleeper
ai
n't
a
heavy
one
,
"
said
Jonas
in
his
sulky
way
;
"
do
n't
sleep
much
,
and
do
n't
sleep
well
,
and
do
n't
sleep
sound
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
dreams
,
"
said
Tigg
,
"
and
cries
out
in
an
ugly
manner
;
and
when
the
candle
burns
down
in
the
night
,
is
in
an
agony
;
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
silent
for
a
little
time
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Jonas
spoke
:
   
"
Now
we
've
done
with
child
's
talk
<EOS>
,
I
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
before
we
meet
up
yonder
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
satisfied
with
the
state
of
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
satisfied
!
"
cried
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
money
comes
in
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
money
comes
in
well
enough
,
"
retorted
Jonas
,
"
but
it
do
n't
come
out
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
got
at
easily
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
sufficient
power
;
it
is
all
in
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Ecod
!
<EOS>
what
with
one
of
your
by
-
laws

you
again
,
there
are
no

<EOS>
Everybody
else
's

are
my
wrongs
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
my
having
a
voice
if
it
's
always
drowned
?
 
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
be
dumb
,
and
it
would
be
much
less
aggravating
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a

going
to
stand
that
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Tigg
in
an
insinuating
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
returned
Jonas
,
"
I
'm
not
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
play
old
Gooseberry
with
the
office
,
and
make
you
glad
to
buy
me
out
at
a
good
high
figure
,
if
you
try
any
of
your
tricks
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
honour
---
"
Montague
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
confound
your
honour
,
"
interrupted
Jonas
,
who
became
more
coarse
and
quarrelsome
as
the
other
remonstrated
,
which
may
have
been
a
part
of
Mr
Montague
's
intention
;
"
I
want
a
little
more
control
over
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
all
the
honour
,
if
you
like
;
I
'll
never
bring
you
to
book
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
a
-
going
to
stand
it
,
as
it
is
now
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
take
it
into
your
honourable
head
to
go
abroad
with
the
bank
,
I
do
n't
see
much
to
prevent
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
That
wo
n't
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
had
some
very
good
dinners
here
,
but
they
'd
come
too
dear
on
such
terms
;
and
therefore
,
that
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
unfortunate
to
find
you
in
this
humour
,
"
said
Tigg
,
with
a
remarkable
kind
of
smile
;
"
for
I
was
going
to
propose
to
you
---
for
your
own
advantage
;
solely
for
your
own
advantage
---
that
you
should
venture
a
little
more
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
you
,
by
G
---
 
?
"
said
Jonas
,
with
a
short
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
suggest
,
"
pursued
Montague
,
"
that
surely
you
have
friends
;
indeed
,
I
know
you
have
;
who
would
answer
our
purpose
admirably
,
and
whom
we
should
be
delighted
to
receive
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
kind
of
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
'd
be
delighted
to
receive
'em
,
would
you
?
"
said
Jonas
,
bantering
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
sacred
honour
,
quite
transported
.
 
<EOS>
As
your
friends
,
observe
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
said
Jonas
;
"
as
my
friends
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
very
much
delighted
when
you
get
'em
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
'll
be
all
to
my
advantage
,
wo
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
very
much
to
your
advantage
,
"
answered
Montague
poising
a
brush
in
each
hand
,
and
looking
steadily
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
very
much
to
your
advantage
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
can
tell
me
how
,
"
said
Jonas
,
"
ca
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
SHALL
I
tell
you
how
?
"
returned
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
had
better
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Strange
things
have
been
done
in
the
Assurance
way
before
now
,
by
strange
sorts
of
men
,
and
I
mean
to
take
care
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Chuzzlewit
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Montague
,
leaning
forward
,
with
his
arms
upon
his
knees
,
and
looking
full
into
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Strange
things
have
been
done
,
and
are
done
every
day
;
not
only
in
our
way
,
but
in
a
variety
of
other
ways
;
and
no
one
suspects
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
ours
,
as
you
say
,
my
good
friend
,
is
a
strange
way
;
and
we
strangely
happen
,
sometimes
,
to
come
into
the
knowledge
of
very
strange
events
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
beckoned
to
Jonas
to
bring
his
chair
nearer
;
and
looking
slightly
round
,
as
if
to
remind
him
of
the
presence
of
Nadgett
,
whispered
in
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
From
red
to
white
;
from
white
to
red
again
;
from
red
to
yellow
;
then
to
a
cold
,
dull
,
awful
,
sweat
-
bedabbled
blue
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
short
whisper
,
all
these
changes
fell
upon
the
face
of
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
;
and
when
at
last
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
whisperer
's
mouth
,
appalled
,
lest
any
syllable
of
what
he
said
should
reach
the
ears
of
the
third
person
present
,
it
was
as
bloodless
and
as
heavy
as
the
hand
of
Death
.
   
<EOS>
He
drew
his
chair
away
,
and
sat
a
spectacle
of
terror
,
misery
,
and
rage
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
to
speak
,
or
look
,
or
move
,
or
sit
still
.
<EOS>
Abject
,
crouching
,
and
miserable
<EOS>
,
he
was
a
greater
degradation
to
the
form
he
bore
,
than
if
he
had
been
a
loathsome
wound
from
head
to
heel
.
   
<EOS>
His
companion
leisurely
resumed
his
dressing
,
and
completed
it
,
glancing
sometimes
with
a
smile
at
the
transformation
he
had
effected
,
but
never
speaking
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
not
object
,
"
he
said
,
when
he
was
quite
equipped
,
"
to
venture
further
with
us
,
Chuzzlewit
,
my
friend
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
pale
lips
faintly
stammered
out
a
"
No
.
"
   
"
Well
said
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
like
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
I
was
thinking
yesterday
that
your
father
-
in
-
law
,
relying
on
your
advice
as
a
man
of
great
sagacity
in
money
matters
,
as
no
doubt
you
are
,
would
join
us
,
if
the
thing
were
well
presented
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
money
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
has
money
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
leave
Mr
Pecksniff
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
undertake
for
Mr
Pecksniff
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
my
best
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
thanks
,
"
replied
the
other
,
clapping
him
upon
the
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
walk
downstairs
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
!
 
<EOS>
Follow
us
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
went
down
in
that
order
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
Jonas
felt
in
reference
to
Montague
;
whatever
sense
he
had
of
being
caged
,
and
barred
,
and
trapped
,
and
having
fallen
down
into
a
pit
of
deepest
ruin
;
whatever
thoughts
came
crowding
on
his
mind
even
at
that
early
time
,
of
one
terrible
chance
of
escape
,
of
one
red
glimmer
in
a
sky
of
blackness
;
he
no
more
thought
that
the
slinking
figure
half
-
a
-
dozen
stairs
behind
him
was
his
pursuing
Fate
,
than
that
the
other
figure
at
his
side
was
his
Good
Angel
.

Chapter
39
.
<EOS>
Containing
some
further
particulars
of
the
domestic
economy
of
the
Pinches
;
with
strange
news
from
the
city
,
narrowly
concerning
tom
 
<EOS>
Pleasant
little
Ruth
!
 
<EOS>
Cheerful
,
tidy
,
bustling
,
quiet
little
Ruth
!
<EOS>
No
doll
's
house
ever
yielded
greater
delight
to
its
young
mistress
,
than
little
Ruth
derived
from
her
glorious
dominion
over
the
triangular
parlour
and
the
two
small
bedrooms
.
   
<EOS>
To
be
Tom
's
housekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
What
dignity
!
 
<EOS>
Housekeeping
,
upon
the
commonest
terms
,
associated
itself
with
elevated
responsibilities
of
all
sorts
and
kinds
;
but
housekeeping
for
Tom
implied
the
utmost
complication
of
grave
trusts
and
mighty
charges
.
 
<EOS>
Well
might
she
take
the
keys
out
of
the
little
chiffonier
which
held
the
tea
and
sugar
;
and
out
of
the
two
little
damp
cupboards
down
by
the
fireplace
,
where
the
very
black
beetles
got
mouldy
,
and
had
the
shine
taken
out
of
their
backs
by
envious
mildew
;
and
jingle
them
upon
a
ring
before
Tom
's
eyes
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
!
 
<EOS>
Well
might
she
,
laughing
musically
,
put
them
up
in
that
blessed
little
pocket
of
hers
with
a
merry
pride
!
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
such
a
grand
novelty
to
be
mistress
of
anything
,
that
if
she
had
been
the
most
relentless
and
despotic
of
all
little
housekeepers
,
she
might
have
pleaded
just
that
much
for
her
excuse
,
and
have
been
honourably
acquitted
.
   
<EOS>
So
far
from
being
despotic
,
however
,
there
was
a
coyness
about
her
very
way
of
pouring
out
the
tea
,
which
Tom
quite
revelled
in
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
she
asked
him
what
he
would
like
to
have
for
dinner
,
and
faltered
out
"
chops
"
as
a
reasonably
good
suggestion
after
their
last
night
's
successful
supper
,
Tom
grew
quite
facetious
,
and
rallied
her
desperately
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
Tom
,
"
said
his
sister
,
blushing
,
"
I
am
not
quite
confident
,
but
I
think
I
could
make
a
beef
-
steak
pudding
,
if
I
tried
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
whole
catalogue
of
cookery
,
there
is
nothing
I
should
like
so
much
as
a
beef
-
steak
pudding
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
slapping
his
leg
to
give
the
greater
force
to
this
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
,
that
's
excellent
!
 
<EOS>
But
if
it
should
happen
not
to
come
quite
right
the
first
time
,
"
his
sister
faltered
;
"
if
it
should
happen
not
to
be
a
pudding
exactly
,
but
should
turn
out
a
stew
,
or
a
soup
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
<EOS>
you
'll
not
be
vexed
,
Tom
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
serious
way
in
which
she
looked
at
Tom
;
the
way
in
which
Tom
looked
at
her
;
and
the
way
in
which
she
gradually
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
at
her
own
expense
,
would
have
enchanted
you
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Tom
"
this
is
capital
.
 
<EOS>
It
gives
us
a
new
,
and
quite
an
uncommon
interest
in
the
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
We
put
into
a
lottery
for
a
beefsteak
pudding
,
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
we
may
get
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
make
some
wonderful
discovery
,
perhaps
,
and
produce
such
a
dish
as
never
was
known
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
we
do
,
Tom
,
"
returned
his
sister
,
still
laughing
merrily
,
"
or
if
it
should
prove
to
be
such
a
dish
as
we
shall
not
feel
very
anxious
to
produce
again
;
but
the
meat
must
come
out
of
the
saucepan
at
last
,
somehow
or
other
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
cook
it
into
nothing
at
all
;
that
's
a
great
comfort
.
<EOS>
So
if
you
like
to
venture
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
doubt
,
"
rejoined
Tom
,
"
that
it
will
come
out
an
excellent
pudding
,
or
at
all
events
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
that
I
shall
think
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
naturally
something
so
handy
and
brisk
about
you
,
Ruth
,
that
if
you
said
you
could
make
a
bowl
of
faultless
turtle
soup
,
I
should
believe
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
Tom
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
precisely
that
sort
of
person
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
ought
to
have
been
able
to
resist
her
coaxing
manner
;
and
nobody
had
any
business
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
she
never
seemed
to
know
it
was
her
manner
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
best
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
she
washed
up
the
breakfast
cups
,
chatting
away
the
whole
time
,
and
telling
Tom
all
sorts
of
anecdotes
about
the
brass
-
and
-
copper
founder
;
put
everything
in
its
place
;
made
the
room
as
neat
as
herself
;
<EOS>
---
you
must
not
suppose
its
shape
was
half
as
neat
as
hers
though
,
or
anything
like
it
---
and
brushed
Tom
's
old
hat
round
and
round
and
round
again
,
until
it
was
as
sleek
as
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
discovered
,
all
in
a
moment
,
that
Tom
's
shirt
-
collar
was
frayed
at
the
edge
;
and
flying
upstairs
for
a
needle
and
thread
,
came
flying
down
again
with
her
thimble
on
,
and
set
it
right
with
wonderful
expertness
;
never
once
sticking
the
needle
into
his
face
,
although
she
was
humming
his
pet
tune
from
first
to
last
,
and
beating
time
with
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
upon
his
neckcloth
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
sooner
done
this
,
than
off
she
was
again
;
and
there
she
stood
once
more
,
as
brisk
and
busy
as
a
bee
,
tying
that
compact
little
chin
of
hers
into
an
equally
compact
little
bonnet
;
intent
on
bustling
out
to
the
butcher
's
,
without
a
minute
's
loss
of
time
;
and
inviting
Tom
to
come
and
see
the
steak
cut
,
with
his
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
As
to
Tom
,
he
was
ready
to
go
anywhere
;
so
off
they
trotted
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
as
nimbly
as
you
please
;
saying
to
each
other
what
a
quiet
street
<EOS>
it
was
to
lodge
in
,
and
how
very
cheap
,
and
what
an
airy
situation
.
   
<EOS>
To
see
the
butcher
slap
the
steak
,
before
he
laid
it
on
the
block
,
and
give
his
knife
a
sharpening
,
was
to
forget
breakfast
instantly
.
<EOS>
It
was
agreeable
,
too
<EOS>
---
it
really
was
---
to
see
him
cut
it
off
,
so
smooth
and
juicy
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
savage
in
the
act
,
although
the
knife
was
large
and
keen
;
it
was
a
piece
of
art
,
high
art
;
there
was
delicacy
of
touch
,
clearness
of
tone
,
skillful
handling
of
the
subject
,
fine
shading
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
triumph
of
mind
over
matter
;
quite
.
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
greenest
cabbage
-
leaf
ever
grown
in
a
garden
was
wrapped
about
this
steak
,
before
it
was
delivered
over
to
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
butcher
had
a
sentiment
for
his
business
,
and
knew
how
to
refine
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
saw
Tom
putting
the
cabbage
-
leaf
into
his
pocket
awkwardly
,
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
do
it
for
him
;
"
for
meat
,
"
he
said
with
some
emotion
,
"
must
be
humoured
,
not
drove
.
"
   
<EOS>
Back
they
went
to
the
lodgings
again
,
after
they
had
bought
some
eggs
,
and
flour
,
and
such
small
matters
;
and
Tom
sat
gravely
down
to
write
at
one
end
of
the
parlour
table
,
while
Ruth
prepared
to
make
the
pudding
at
the
other
end
;
for
there
was
nobody
in
the
house
but
an
old
woman
<EOS>
(
the
landlord
being
a
mysterious
sort
of
man
,
who
went
out
early
in
the
morning
,
and
was
scarcely
ever
seen
)
;
and
saving
in
mere
household
drudgery
,
they
waited
on
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
writing
,
Tom
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
his
sister
,
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Tom
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
and
looking
up
in
her
face
,
"
I
am
very
anxious
,
of
course
,
to
obtain
some
suitable
employment
;
and
before
Mr
Westlock
comes
this
afternoon
,
I
think
I
may
as
well
prepare
a
little
description
of
myself
and
my
qualifications
;
such
as
he
could
show
to
any
friend
of
his
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
do
the
same
for
me
,
Tom
,
also
,
"
said
his
sister
,
casting
down
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
dearly
like
to
keep
house
for
you
and
take
care
of
you
always
,
Tom
;
but
we
are
not
rich
enough
for
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
rich
,
"
returned
Tom
,
"
certainly
;
and
we
may
be
much
poorer
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
will
not
part
if
we
can
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
we
will
make
up
our
minds
Ruth
,
that
unless
we
are
so
very
unfortunate
as
to
render
me
quite
sure
that
you
would
be
better
off
away
from
me
than
with
me
,
we
will
battle
it
out
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
certain
we
shall
be
happier
if
we
can
battle
it
out
together
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
we
shall
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Think
,
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
tut
,
tut
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Tom
,
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
cry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
I
wo
n't
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
ca
n't
afford
it
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
know
that
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
are
we
to
know
that
,
yet
awhile
,
and
without
trying
?
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
---
Tom
's
energy
became
quite
grand
---
"
there
is
no
knowing
what
may
happen
,
if
we
try
hard
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
sure
we
can
live
contentedly
upon
a
very
little
---
if
we
can
only
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
that
I
am
sure
we
can
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
we
must
try
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
,
John
Westlock
,
is
a
capital
fellow
,
and
very
shrewd
and
intelligent
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
his
advice
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
talk
it
over
with
him
---
both
of
us
together
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
like
John
very
much
,
<EOS>
when
you
come
to
know
him
,
I
am
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
cry
,
do
n't
cry
.
 
<EOS>
YOU
make
a
beef
-
steak
pudding
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
giving
her
a
gentle
push
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
have
n't
boldness
enough
for
a
dumpling
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
WILL
call
it
a
pudding
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
may
as
well
call
it
that
,
till
it
proves
to
be
something
else
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
going
to
work
in
earnest
,
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
!
 
<EOS>
That
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
such
pleasant
earnest
,
moreover
,
that
Tom
's
attention
wandered
from
his
writing
every
moment
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
she
tripped
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
for
the
flour
,
then
for
the
pie
-
board
,
then
for
the
eggs
,
then
for
the
butter
,
then
for
a
jug
of
water
,
then
for
the
rolling
-
pin
,
then
for
a
pudding
-
basin
,
then
for
the
pepper
,
then
for
the
salt
;
making
a
separate
journey
for
everything
,
and
laughing
every
time
she
started
off
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
When
all
the
materials
were
collected
she
was
horrified
to
find
she
had
no
apron
on
,
and
so
ran
UPstairs
by
way
of
variety
,
to
fetch
it
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
put
it
on
upstairs
,
but
came
dancing
down
with
it
in
her
hand
;
and
being
one
of
those
little
women
to
whom
an
apron
is
a
most
becoming
little
vanity
<EOS>
,
it
took
an
immense
time
to
arrange
;
having
to
be
carefully
smoothed
down
beneath
---
<EOS>
Oh
,
heaven
,
what
a
wicked
little
stomacher
!
<EOS>
---
and
to
be
gathered
up
into
little
plaits
by
the
strings
before
it
could
be
tied
,
and
to
be
tapped
,
rebuked
,
and
wheedled
,
at
the
pockets
,
before
it
would
set
right
,
which
at
last
it
did
,
and
when
it
did
---
but
never
mind
;
this
is
a
sober
chronicle
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
there
were
her
cuffs
to
be
tucked
up
,
for
fear
of
flour
;
and
she
had
a
little
ring
to
pull
off
her
finger
,
which
would
n't
come
off
(
foolish
little
ring
!
)
;
and
during
the
whole
of
these
preparations
she
looked
demurely
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
at
Tom
,
from
under
her
dark
eyelashes
,
as
if
they
were
all
a
part
of
the
pudding
,
and
indispensable
to
its
composition
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
life
and
soul
of
him
,
Tom
could
get
no
further
in
his
writing
than
,
"
<EOS>
A
respectable
young
man
,
aged
thirty
-
five
,
"
and
this
,
notwithstanding
the
show
she
made
of
being
supernaturally
quiet
,
and
going
about
on
tiptoe
,
lest
she
should
disturb
him
;
which
only
served
as
an
additional
means
of
distracting
his
attention
,
and
keeping
it
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
in
high
glee
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
now
?
"
said
Tom
,
repeating
to
himself
,
"
aged
thirty
-
five
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
look
here
a
moment
,
please
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
if
he
had
n't
been
looking
all
the
time
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
begin
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
wonder
why
I
butter
the
inside
of
the
basin
?
"
said
his
busy
little
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
more
than
you
do
,
I
dare
say
,
"
replied
Tom
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
I
believe
you
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
infidel
you
are
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
How
else
do
you
think
it
would
turn
out
easily
when
it
was
done
!
 
<EOS>
For
a
civil
-
engineer
and
land
-
surveyor
not
to
know
that
!
 
<EOS>
My
goodness
,
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
wholly
out
of
the
question
to
try
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
lined
out
"
respectable
young
man
,
aged
thirty
-
five
;
"
and
sat
looking
on
,
pen
in
hand
,
with
one
of
the
most
loving
smiles
imaginable
.
   
<EOS>
Such
a
busy
little
woman
as
she
was
!
 
<EOS>
So
full
of
self
-
importance
and
trying
so
hard
not
to
smile
,
or
seem
uncertain
about
anything
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
perfect
treat
to
Tom
to
see
her
with
her
brows
knit
,
and
her
rosy
lips
pursed
up
,
kneading
away
at
the
crust
,
rolling
it
out
,
cutting
it
up
into
strips
,
lining
the
basin
with
it
,
shaving
it
off
<EOS>
fine
round
the
rim
,
chopping
up
the
steak
into
small
pieces
,
raining
down
pepper
and
salt
upon
them
,
packing
them
into
the
basin
,
pouring
in
cold
water
for
gravy
,
and
never
venturing
to
steal
a
look
in
his
direction
,
lest
her
gravity
should
be
disturbed
<EOS>
;
until
,
at
last
,
the
basin
being
quite
full
and
only
wanting
the
top
crust
,
she
clapped
her
hands
all
covered
with
paste
and
flour
,
at
Tom
,
and
burst
out
heartily
into
such
a
charming
little
laugh
of
triumph
,
that
the
pudding
need
have
had
no
other
seasoning
to
commend
it
to
the
taste
of
any
reasonable
man
on
earth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
the
pudding
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
was
cutting
his
jokes
,
Tom
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
holding
it
up
with
both
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
THAT
a
pudding
!
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
WILL
be
,
you
stupid
fellow
,
when
it
's
covered
in
,
"
returned
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
still
pretending
to
look
incredulous
,
she
gave
him
a
tap
on
the
head
with
the
rolling
-
pin
,
and
still
laughing
merrily
,
had
returned
to
the
composition
of
the
top
crust
,
when
she
started
and
turned
very
red
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
started
,
too
,
for
following
her
eyes
,
he
saw
John
Westlock
in
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
goodness
,
John
!
 
<EOS>
How
did
YOU
come
in
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
pardon
,
"
said
John
---
"
your
sister
's
pardon
especially
---
<EOS>
but
I
met
an
old
lady
at
the
street
door
,
who
requested
me
to
enter
here
;
and
as
you
did
n't
hear
me
knock
,
and
the
door
was
open
,
I
made
bold
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
,
"
said
John
,
with
a
smile
,
"
why
any
of
us
should
be
disconcerted
at
my
having
accidentally
intruded
upon
such
an
agreeable
domestic
occupation
,
so
very
agreeably
and
skilfully
pursued
;
but
I
must
confess
that
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
,
will
you
kindly
come
to
my
relief
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
John
Westlock
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
sister
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
,
as
the
sister
of
so
old
a
friend
,
"
said
John
,
laughing
"
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
detach
your
first
impressions
of
me
from
my
unfortunate
entrance
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
sister
is
not
indisposed
perhaps
to
say
the
same
to
you
on
her
own
behalf
,
"
retorted
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
John
said
,
of
course
,
that
this
was
quite
unnecessary
,
for
he
had
been
transfixed
in
silent
admiration
;
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
Miss
Pinch
;
who
could
n't
take
it
,
however
,
by
reason
of
the
flour
and
paste
upon
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
which
might
seem
calculated
to
increase
the
general
confusion
and
render
matters
worse
,
had
in
reality
the
best
effect
in
the
world
,
for
neither
of
them
could
help
laughing
;
and
so
they
both
found
themselves
on
easy
terms
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
think
of
sitting
down
on
one
condition
,
"
returned
his
friend
;
"
and
that
is
,
that
your
sister
goes
on
with
the
pudding
,
as
if
you
were
still
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
sure
she
will
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
one
other
condition
,
and
that
is
,
that
you
stay
and
help
us
to
eat
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
little
Ruth
was
seized
with
a
palpitation
of
the
heart
when
Tom
committed
this
appalling
indiscretion
,
for
she
felt
that
if
the
dish
turned
out
a
failure
,
she
never
would
be
able
to
hold
up
her
head
before
John
Westlock
again
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
unconscious
of
her
state
of
mind
,
John
accepted
the
invitation
with
all
imaginable
heartiness
;
and
after
a
little
more
pleasantry
concerning
this
same
pudding
,
and
the
tremendous
expectations
he
made
believe
to
entertain
of
it
,
she
blushingly
resumed
her
occupation
,
and
he
took
a
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
much
earlier
than
I
intended
,
Tom
;
but
I
will
tell
you
,
what
brings
me
,
and
I
think
I
can
answer
for
your
being
glad
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
anything
you
wish
to
show
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
who
had
forgotten
the
blotted
scrap
of
paper
in
his
hand
,
until
this
inquiry
brought
it
to
his
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
A
respectable
young
man
,
aged
thirty
-
five
"
---
The
beginning
of
a
description
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
will
have
occasion
to
finish
it
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
is
it
<EOS>
you
never
told
me
you
had
friends
in
London
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
looked
at
his
sister
with
all
his
might
;
and
certainly
his
sister
looked
with
all
her
might
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Friends
in
London
!
"
echoed
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Westlock
,
"
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
YOU
any
friends
in
London
,
Ruth
,
my
dear
!
"
asked
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
to
hear
that
I
have
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
but
it
's
news
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
be
capital
people
to
keep
a
secret
,
John
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
judge
for
yourself
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Seriously
,
Tom
,
here
is
the
plain
state
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
was
sitting
at
breakfast
this
morning
,
there
comes
a
knock
at
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
which
you
cried
out
,
very
loud
,
"
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
"
suggested
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
person
who
knocked
,
not
being
a
respectable
young
man
,
aged
thirty
-
five
,
from
the
country
,
came
in
when
he
was
invited
,
instead
of
standing
gaping
and
staring
about
him
on
the
landing
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
in
,
I
found
he
was
a
stranger
;
a
grave
,
business
-
like
,
sedate
-
looking
,
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Westlock
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
name
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
The
favour
of
a
few
words
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
seated
,
sir
,
"
said
I.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
John
stopped
for
an
instant
,
to
glance
towards
the
table
,
where
Tom
's
sister
,
listening
attentively
,
was
still
busy
with
the
basin
,
which
by
this
time
made
a
noble
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
resumed
:
   
"
<EOS>
The
pudding
having
taken
a
chair
,
Tom
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
What
!
"
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Having
taken
a
chair
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
said
a
pudding
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
John
,
colouring
rather
;
"
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
a
stranger
coming
into
my
rooms
at
half
-
past
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
taking
a
pudding
!
 
<EOS>
Having
taken
a
chair
,
Tom
,
a
chair
---
 
amazed
me
by
opening
the
conversation
thus
:
"
I
believe
you
are
acquainted
,
sir
,
with
Mr
Thomas
Pinch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
very
words
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
know
where
you
were
at
present
residing
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
In
London
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
casually
heard
,
in
a
roundabout
way
,
that
you
had
left
your
situation
with
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Was
that
the
fact
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
want
another
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Tom
,
nodding
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
what
I
impressed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
rest
<EOS>
assured
that
I
set
that
point
beyond
the
possibility
of
any
mistake
,
and
gave
him
distinctly
to
understand
that
he
might
make
up
his
mind
about
it
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
"
   
"
Then
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
think
I
can
accommodate
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Tom
's
sister
stopped
short
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ruth
,
my
dear
,
"
think
I
can
accommodate
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
begged
him
,
"
pursued
John
Westlock
,
glancing
at
Tom
's
sister
,
who
was
not
less
eager
in
her
interest
than
Tom
himself
,
"
to
proceed
,
and
said
that
I
would
undertake
to
see
you
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
He
replied
that
he
had
very
little
to
say
,
being
a
man
of
few
words
,
but
such
as
it
was
,
it
was
to
the
purpose
---
and
<EOS>
so
,
indeed
,
it
turned
out
---
<EOS>
for
he
immediately
went
on
to
tell
me
that
a
friend
of
his
was
in
want
of
a
kind
of
secretary
and
librarian
;
and
that
although
the
salary
was
small
,
being
only
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
with
neither
board
nor
lodging
,
still
the
duties
were
not
heavy
,
and
there
the
post
was
.
 
<EOS>
Vacant
,
and
ready
for
your
acceptance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Tom
;
"
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
John
!
 
<EOS>
Ruth
,
my
love
!
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
pounds
a
year
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
strangest
part
of
the
story
,
"
resumed
John
Westlock
,
laying
his
hand
on
Tom
's
wrist
,
to
bespeak
his
attention
,
and
repress
his
ecstasies
for
the
moment
;
"
the
strangest
part
of
the
story
,
Miss
Pinch
,
is
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
this
man
from
Adam
;
neither
does
this
man
know
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
,
"
said
Tom
,
in
great
perplexity
,
"
if
he
's
a
Londoner
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
any
one
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
on
my
observing
,
"
John
resumed
,
still
keeping
his
hand
upon
Tom
's
wrist
,
"
that
I
had
no
doubt
he
would
excuse
the
freedom
I
took
in
inquiring
who
directed
him
to
me
;
how
he
came
to
know
of
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
my
friend
's
position
;
and
how
he
came
to
be
acquainted
with
my
friend
's
peculiar
fitness
for
such
an
office
as
he
had
described
;
he
drily
said
that
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
enter
into
any
explanations
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
Not
at
liberty
to
enter
into
any
explanations
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Tom
,
drawing
a
long
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
must
be
perfectly
aware
,
"
he
said
,
"
John
added
,
"
"
<EOS>
that
to
any
person
who
had
ever
been
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
neighbourhood
,
Mr
Thomas
Pinch
and
his
acquirements
were
as
well
known
as
the
Church
steeple
,
or
the
Blue
Dragon
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
The
Blue
Dragon
!
"
repeated
Tom
,
staring
alternately
at
his
friend
and
his
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
think
of
that
!
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
as
familiarly
of
the
Blue
Dragon
,
I
give
you
my
word
,
as
if
he
had
been
Mark
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
my
eyes
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
when
he
did
so
;
but
<EOS>
I
could
not
fancy
<EOS>
I
had
ever
seen
the
man
before
,
although
he
said
with
a
smile
,
"
<EOS>
You
know
the
Blue
Dragon
,
Mr
Westlock
;
you
kept
it
up
there
,
once
or
twice
,
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
Kept
it
up
there
!
 
<EOS>
So
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
nodded
with
great
significance
,
and
,
falling
into
a
state
of
deeper
perplexity
than
before
,
observed
that
this
was
the
most
unaccountable
and
extraordinary
circumstance
he
had
ever
heard
of
in
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
Unaccountable
?
<EOS>
"
his
friend
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
became
afraid
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
Though
it
was
broad
day
,
and
bright
sunshine
,
I
was
positively
afraid
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
half
suspected
him
to
be
a
supernatural
visitor
,
and
not
a
mortal
,
until
he
took
out
a
common
-
place
description
of
pocket
-
book
,
and
handed
me
this
card
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Fips
,
"
said
Tom
,
reading
it
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Austin
Friars
.
 
<EOS>
Austin
Friars
sounds
ghostly
,
John
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fips
do
n't
,
I
think
,
"
was
John
's
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
there
he
lives
,
Tom
,
and
there
he
expects
us
to
call
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
you
know
as
much
of
this
strange
incident
as
I
do
,
upon
my
honour
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
face
,
between
his
exultation
in
the
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
and
his
wonder
at
this
narration
,
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
face
of
his
sister
,
on
which
there
sat
the
very
best
expression
of
blooming
surprise
that
any
painter
could
have
wished
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
beef
-
steak
pudding
would
have
come
to
,
if
it
had
not
been
by
this
time
<EOS>
finished
,
astrology
itself
could
hardly
determine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
said
Ruth
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
"
perhaps
Mr
Westlock
,
in
his
friendship
for
you
,
knows
more
of
this
than
he
chooses
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
so
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
were
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
take
credit
to
myself
,
Miss
Pinch
,
for
any
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
I
know
,
or
,
so
far
as
I
can
judge
,
am
likely
to
know
,
I
have
told
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
you
know
more
,
if
you
thought
proper
?
"
said
Ruth
,
scraping
the
pie
-
board
industriously
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
retorted
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
ungenerous
in
you
to
be
so
suspicious
of
me
when
I
repose
implicit
faith
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
unbounded
confidence
in
the
pudding
,
Miss
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
laughed
at
this
,
but
they
soon
got
back
into
a
serious
vein
,
and
discussed
the
subject
with
profound
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
else
was
obscure
in
the
business
,
it
appeared
to
be
quite
plain
that
Tom
was
offered
a
salary
of
one
hundred
pounds
a
year
;
and
this
being
the
main
point
,
the
surrounding
obscurity
rather
set
it
off
than
otherwise
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
,
being
in
a
great
flutter
,
wished
to
start
for
Austin
Friars
instantly
,
but
they
waited
nearly
an
hour
,
by
John
's
advice
,
before
they
departed
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
made
himself
as
spruce
as
he
could
before
leaving
home
,
and
when
John
Westlock
,
through
the
half
-
opened
parlour
door
,
had
glimpses
of
that
brave
little
sister
brushing
the
collar
of
his
coat
in
the
passage
,
taking
up
loose
stitches
in
his
gloves
and
hovering
lightly
about
and
about
him
,
touching
him
up
here
and
there
in
the
height
of
her
quaint
,
little
,
old
-
fashioned
tidiness
,
he
called
to
mind
the
fancy
-
portraits
of
her
on
the
wall
of
the
Pecksniffian
workroom
,
and
decided
with
uncommon
indignation
that
they
were
gross
libels
,
and
not
half
pretty
enough
;
though
,
as
hath
been
mentioned
in
its
place
,
the
artists
always
made
those
sketches
beautiful
,
and
he
had
drawn
at
least
a
score
of
them
with
his
own
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
he
said
,
as
they
were
walking
along
,
"
I
begin
to
think
you
must
be
somebody
's
son
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
am
,
"
Tom
answered
in
his
quiet
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
mean
somebody
's
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
heart
,
"
replied
Tom
,
"
<EOS>
my
poor
father
was
of
no
consequence
,
nor
my
mother
either
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
remember
them
perfectly
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Remember
them
?
<EOS>
oh
dear
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
mother
was
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
She
died
when
Ruth
was
a
mere
baby
,
and
then
we
both
became
a
charge
upon
the
savings
of
that
good
old
grandmother
I
used
to
tell
you
of
.
<EOS>
You
remember
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
romantic
in
our
history
,
John
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
John
in
quiet
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
there
is
no
way
of
accounting
for
my
visitor
of
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
'll
not
try
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
did
try
,
notwithstanding
,
and
never
left
off
trying
until
they
got
to
Austin
Friars
,
where
,
in
a
very
dark
passage
on
the
first
floor
,
oddly
situated
at
the
back
of
a
house
,
across
some
leads
,
they
found
a
little
blear
-
eyed
glass
door
up
in
one
corner
,
with
MR
.
<EOS>
FIPS
painted
on
it
in
characters
which
were
meant
to
be
transparent
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
a
wicked
old
sideboard
hiding
in
the
gloom
hard
by
,
meditating
designs
upon
the
ribs
of
visitors
;
and
an
old
mat
,
worn
into
lattice
work
,
which
,
being
useless
as
a
mat
(
even
if
anybody
could
have
seen
it
,
which
was
impossible
)
,
had
for
many
years
directed
its
industry
into
another
channel
,
and
regularly
tripped
up
every
one
of
Mr
Fips
's
clients
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fips
,
hearing
a
violent
concussion
between
a
human
hat
and
his
office
door
,
was
apprised
,
by
the
usual
means
of
communication
,
that
somebody
had
come
to
call
upon
him
,
and
giving
that
somebody
admission
,
observed
that
it
was
"
rather
dark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dark
indeed
,
"
John
whispered
in
Tom
Pinch
's
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bad
place
to
dispose
of
a
countryman
in
<EOS>
,
I
should
think
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
had
been
already
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
possibility
of
their
having
been
tempted
into
that
region
to
furnish
forth
a
pie
;
but
the
sight
of
Mr
Fips
,
who
was
small
and
spare
,
and
looked
peaceable
,
and
wore
black
shorts
and
powder
,
dispelled
his
doubts
.
   
<EOS>
"
Walk
in
,
"
said
Mr
Fips
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
in
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
mighty
yellow
-
jaundiced
little
office
Mr
Fips
had
of
it
;
with
a
great
,
black
,
sprawling
splash
upon
the
floor
in
one
corner
,
as
if
some
old
clerk
had
cut
his
throat
there
,
years
ago
,
and
had
let
out
ink
instead
of
blood
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
my
friend
Mr
Pinch
,
sir
,
"
said
John
Westlock
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
pleased
to
sit
,
"
said
Mr
Fips
.
   
<EOS>
They
occupied
the
two
chairs
,
and
Mr
Fips
took
the
office
stool
from
the
stuffing
<EOS>
whereof
he
drew
forth
a
piece
of
horse
-
hair
of
immense
length
,
which
he
put
into
his
mouth
with
a
great
appearance
of
appetite
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Tom
Pinch
curiously
,
but
with
an
entire
freedom
from
any
such
expression
as
could
be
reasonably
construed
into
an
unusual
display
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
silence
,
during
which
Mr
Fips
was
so
perfectly
unembarrassed
as
to
render
it
manifest
that
he
could
have
broken
it
sooner
without
hesitation
,
if
he
had
felt
inclined
to
do
so
,
he
asked
if
Mr
Westlock
had
made
his
offer
fully
known
to
Mr
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
John
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
think
it
worth
your
while
,
sir
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Fips
inquired
of
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
a
piece
of
great
good
fortune
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
for
the
offer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to
me
,
"
said
Mr
Fips
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
act
upon
instructions
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
your
friend
,
sir
,
then
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
gentleman
with
whom
I
am
to
engage
,
and
whose
confidence
I
shall
endeavour
to
deserve
.
<EOS>
When
he
knows
me
better
,
sir
,
I
hope
he
will
not
lose
his
good
opinion
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
find
me
punctual
and
vigilant
,
and
anxious
to
do
what
is
right
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
think
I
can
answer
for
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
"
looking
towards
him
,
"
can
Mr
Westlock
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Most
assuredly
,
"
said
John
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fips
appeared
to
have
some
little
difficulty
in
resuming
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
To
relieve
himself
,
he
took
up
the
wafer
-
stamp
,
and
began
stamping
capital
F
's
all
over
his
legs
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
"
said
Mr
Fips
,
"
that
my
friend
is
not
,
at
this
present
moment
,
in
town
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
countenance
fell
;
for
he
thought
this
equivalent
to
telling
him
that
his
appearance
did
not
answer
;
and
that
Fips
must
look
out
for
somebody
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
do
you
think
he
will
be
in
town
,
sir
?
"
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
;
it
's
impossible
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
have
no
idea
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
Fips
,
taking
off
a
very
deep
impression
of
the
wafer
-
stamp
upon
the
calf
of
his
left
leg
,
and
looking
steadily
at
Tom
,
"
I
do
n't
know
that
it
's
a
matter
of
much
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Tom
inclined
his
head
deferentially
,
but
appeared
to
doubt
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
repeated
Mr
Fips
,
"
that
I
do
n't
know
it
's
a
matter
of
much
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
The
business
lies
entirely
between
yourself
and
me
,
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
With
reference
to
your
duties
,
I
can
set
you
going
;
and
with
reference
to
your
salary
,
I
can
pay
it
.
 
<EOS>
Weekly
,
"
said
Mr
Fips
,
putting
down
the
wafer
-
stamp
,
and
looking
at
John
Westlock
and
Tom
Pinch
by
turns
,
"
weekly
;
in
this
office
;
at
any
time
between
the
hours
of
four
and
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Fips
said
this
,
he
made
up
his
face
as
if
he
were
going
to
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
did
n't
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
"
said
Tom
,
whose
countenance
was
now
suffused
with
pleasure
;
"
<EOS>
and
nothing
can
be
more
satisfactory
or
straightforward
.
 
<EOS>
My
attendance
will
be
required
---
"
   
"
From
half
-
past
nine
to
four
o'clock
or
so
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Fips
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
the
hours
of
attendance
,
"
retorted
Tom
,
"
which
are
light
and
easy
,
I
am
sure
;
but
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
place
!
 
<EOS>
The
place
is
in
the
Temple
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
delighted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
Mr
Fips
,
"
you
would
like
to
see
the
place
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
only
be
too
glad
to
consider
myself
engaged
,
if
you
will
allow
me
;
without
any
further
reference
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
consider
yourself
engaged
,
by
all
means
,
"
said
Mr
Fips
;
"
you
could
n't
meet
me
at
the
Temple
Gate
in
Fleet
Street
,
in
an
hour
from
this
time
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
could
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Certainly
Tom
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
Mr
Fips
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
show
you
the
place
;
and
you
can
begin
your
attendance
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
hour
,
therefore
,
I
shall
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
too
<EOS>
,
Mr
Westlock
?
 
<EOS>
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
how
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
rather
dark
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
remark
,
which
seemed
superfluous
,
he
shut
them
out
upon
the
staircase
,
and
they
groped
their
way
into
the
street
again
.
<EOS>
The
interview
had
done
so
little
to
remove
the
mystery
in
which
Tom
's
new
engagement
was
involved
,
and
had
done
so
much
to
thicken
it
,
that
neither
could
help
smiling
at
the
puzzled
looks
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
They
agreed
,
however
,
that
the
introduction
of
Tom
to
his
new
office
and
office
companions
could
hardly
fail
to
throw
a
light
upon
the
subject
;
and
therefore
postponed
its
further
consideration
until
after
the
fulfillment
of
the
appointment
they
had
made
with
Mr
Fips
.
   
<EOS>
After
looking
at
John
Westlock
's
chambers
,
and
devoting
a
few
spare
minutes
to
the
Boar
's
Head
,
they
issued
forth
again
to
the
place
of
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
agreed
upon
had
not
quite
come
;
but
Mr
Fips
was
already
at
the
Temple
Gate
,
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
their
punctuality
.
   
<EOS>
He
led
the
way
through
sundry
lanes
and
courts
,
into
one
more
quiet
and
more
gloomy
than
the
rest
,
and
,
singling
out
a
certain
house
,
ascended
a
common
staircase
;
taking
from
his
pocket
,
as
he
went
,
a
bunch
of
rusty
keys
.
 
<EOS>
Stopping
before
a
door
upon
an
upper
story
,
which
had
nothing
but
a
yellow
smear
of
paint
where
custom
would
have
placed
the
tenant
's
name
,
he
began
to
beat
the
dust
out
of
one
of
these
keys
,
very
deliberately
,
upon
the
great
broad
handrail
of
the
balustrade
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
have
a
little
plug
made
,
"
he
said
,
looking
round
at
Tom
,
after
blowing
a
shrill
whistle
into
the
barrel
of
the
key
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
only
way
of
preventing
them
from
getting
stopped
up
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
the
lock
go
the
better
,
too
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
for
a
little
oil
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
thanked
him
;
but
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
own
speculations
,
and
John
Westlock
's
looks
,
to
be
very
talkative
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mr
Fips
opened
the
door
,
which
yielded
to
his
hand
very
unwillingly
,
and
with
a
horribly
discordant
sound
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
key
out
,
when
he
had
done
so
,
and
gave
it
to
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
!
"
said
Mr
Fips
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
dust
lies
rather
thick
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Truly
,
it
did
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Fips
might
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
,
very
thick
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
accumulated
everywhere
;
lay
deep
on
everything
,
and
in
one
part
,
where
a
ray
of
sun
shone
through
a
crevice
in
the
shutter
and
struck
upon
the
opposite
wall
,
it
went
twirling
round
and
round
,
like
a
gigantic
squirrel
-
cage
.
   
<EOS>
Dust
was
the
only
thing
in
the
place
that
had
any
motion
about
it
.
<EOS>
When
their
conductor
admitted
the
light
freely
,
and
lifting
up
the
heavy
window
-
sash
,
let
in
the
summer
air
,
he
showed
the
mouldering
furniture
,
discoloured
wainscoting
and
ceiling
,
rusty
stove
,
and
ashy
hearth
,
in
all
their
inert
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
Close
to
the
door
there
stood
a
candlestick
,
with
an
extinguisher
upon
it
;
as
if
the
last
man
who
had
been
there
had
paused
,
after
securing
a
retreat
,
to
take
a
parting
look
at
the
dreariness
he
left
behind
,
and
then
had
shut
out
light
and
life
together
,
and
closed
the
place
up
like
a
tomb
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
two
rooms
on
that
floor
;
and
in
the
first
or
outer
one
a
narrow
staircase
,
leading
to
two
more
above
.
 
<EOS>
These
last
were
fitted
up
as
bed
-
chambers
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
in
them
,
nor
in
the
rooms
below
,
was
any
scarcity
of
convenient
furniture
observable
,
although
the
fittings
were
of
a
bygone
fashion
;
but
solitude
and
want
of
use
seemed
to
have
rendered
it
unfit
for
any
purposes
of
comfort
,
and
to
have
given
it
a
grisly
,
haunted
air
.
   
<EOS>
Movables
of
every
kind
lay
strewn
about
,
without
the
least
attempt
at
order
,
and
were
intermixed
with
boxes
,
hampers
,
and
all
sorts
of
lumber
.
 
<EOS>
On
all
the
floors
were
piles
of
books
,
to
the
amount
,
perhaps
,
of
some
thousands
of
volumes
:
these
,
still
in
bales
;
those
,
wrapped
in
paper
,
as
they
had
been
purchased
;
others
scattered
singly
or
in
heaps
;
not
one
upon
the
shelves
which
lined
the
walls
.
<EOS>
To
these
Mr
Fips
called
Tom
's
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
Before
anything
else
can
be
done
,
we
must
have
them
put
in
order
,
catalogued
,
and
ranged
upon
the
book
-
shelves
,
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
That
will
do
to
begin
with
,
I
think
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
rubbed
his
hands
in
the
pleasant
anticipation
of
a
task
so
congenial
to
his
taste
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
An
occupation
full
of
interest
for
me
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
occupy
me
,
perhaps
,
until
Mr.
---
"
   
"
Until
Mr.
---
"
repeated
Fips
;
as
much
as
to
ask
Tom
what
he
was
stopping
for
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
that
you
had
not
mentioned
the
gentleman
's
name
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
Mr
Fips
,
pulling
on
his
glove
,
"
did
n't
I
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
I
do
n't
think
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
'll
be
here
soon
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
get
on
very
well
together
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
success
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
forget
to
shut
the
door
?
 
<EOS>
It
'll
lock
of
itself
if
you
slam
it
.
 
<EOS>
Half
-
past
nine
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
say
from
half
-
past
nine
to
four
,
or
half
-
past
four
,
or
thereabouts
;
one
day
,
perhaps
,
a
little
earlier
,
another
day
,
perhaps
,
a
little
later
,
according
as
you
feel
disposed
,
and
as
you
arrange
your
work
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Fips
,
Austin
Friars
of
course
you
'll
remember
?
 
<EOS>
And
you
wo
n't
forget
to
slam
the
door
,
if
you
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
all
this
in
such
a
comfortable
,
easy
manner
,
that
Tom
could
only
rub
his
hands
,
and
nod
his
head
,
and
smile
in
acquiescence
which
he
was
still
doing
,
when
Mr
Fips
walked
coolly
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
's
gone
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
's
more
,
Tom
,
"
said
John
Westlock
,
seating
himself
upon
a
pile
of
books
,
and
looking
up
at
his
astonished
friend
,
"
he
is
evidently
not
coming
back
again
;
so
here
you
are
,
installed
.
 
<EOS>
Under
rather
singular
circumstances
,
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
such
an
odd
affair
throughout
,
and
Tom
standing
there
among
the
books
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
the
key
in
the
other
,
looked
so
prodigiously
confounded
,
that
his
friend
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
himself
was
tickled
;
no
less
by
the
hilarity
of
his
friend
than
by
the
recollection
of
the
sudden
manner
in
which
he
had
been
brought
to
a
stop
,
in
the
very
height
of
his
urbane
conference
with
Mr
Fips
;
so
by
degrees
<EOS>
Tom
burst
out
laughing
too
;
and
each
making
the
other
laugh
more
,
they
fairly
roared
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
had
had
their
laugh
out
,
which
did
not
happen
very
soon
,
for
give
John
an
inch
that
way
<EOS>
and
he
was
sure
to
take
several
ells
,
being
a
jovial
,
good
-
tempered
fellow
,
they
looked
about
them
more
closely
,
groping
among
the
lumber
for
any
stray
means
of
enlightenment
that
might
turn
up
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
scrap
or
shred
of
information
could
they
find
.
 
<EOS>
The
books
were
marked
with
a
variety
of
owner
's
names
,
having
,
no
doubt
,
been
bought
at
sales
,
and
collected
here
and
there
at
different
times
;
but
whether
any
one
of
these
names
belonged
to
Tom
's
employer
,
and
,
if
so
,
which
of
them
,
they
had
no
means
whatever
of
determining
.
 
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
John
as
a
very
bright
thought
to
make
inquiry
at
the
steward
's
office
,
to
whom
the
chambers
belonged
,
or
by
whom
they
were
held
;
but
he
came
back
no
wiser
than
he
went
,
<EOS>
the
answer
being
,
"
Mr
Fips
,
of
Austin
Friars
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
Tom
,
I
begin
to
think
it

Fips
is
an
eccentric
man
;
has
some
knowledge
of
Pecksniff
;
despises
him
,
of
course
;
has
heard
or
seen
enough
of
you
to
know
that
you
are
the
man
he
wants

and
engages
you
in

whimsical
manner

"
   
<EOS>
"
But
why
in
his
own
whimsical
manner
?
"
asked
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
why
does
any
man
entertain
his
own
whimsical
taste
?
 
<EOS>
Why
does
Mr
Fips
wear
shorts
and
powder
,
and
Mr
Fips
's
next
-
door
neighbour
boots
and
a
wig

Tom
,
being
in
that
state
of
mind
in
which
any
explanation
is
a
great
relief
,
adopted
this
last
one
(
which
indeed
was
quite
as
feasible
as
any
other
)
readily
,
and
said
he
had
no
doubt
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
his
faith
at
all
shaken
by
his
having
said
exactly
the
same
thing
to
each
suggestion
of
his
friend
's
in
turn
,
and
being
perfectly
ready
to
say
it
again
if
he
had
any
new
solution
to
propose
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
had
not
,
Tom
drew
down
the
window
-
sash
,
and
folded
the
shutter
;
and
they
left
the
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
He
closed
the
door
heavily
,
as
Mr
Fips
had
desired
him
;
tried
it
,
found
it
all
safe
,
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
They
made
a
pretty
wide
circuit
in
going
back
to
Islington
,
as
they
had
time
to
spare
,
and
Tom
was
never
tired
of
looking
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
well
<EOS>
he
had
John
Westlock
for
his
companion
,
for
most
people
would
have
been
weary
of
his
perpetual
stoppages
at
shop
-
windows
,
and
his
frequent
dashes
into
the
crowded
carriage
-
way
at
the
peril
of
his
life
,
to
get
the
better
view
of
church
steeples
,
and
other
public
buildings
.
 
<EOS>
But
John
was
charmed
to
see
him
so
much
interested
,
and
<EOS>
every
time
Tom
came
back
with
a
beaming
face
from
among
the
wheels
of
carts
and
hackney
-
coaches
,
wholly
unconscious
of
the
personal
congratulations
addressed
to
him
by
the
drivers
,
John
seemed
to
like
him
better
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
flour
on
Ruth
's
hands
when
she
received
them
in
the
triangular
parlour
,
but
there
were
pleasant
smiles
upon
her
face
,
and
a
crowd
of
welcomes
shining
out
of
every
smile
,
and
gleaming
in
her
bright
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
how
bright
they
were
!
 
<EOS>
Looking
into
them
for
but
<EOS>
a
moment
,
when
you
took
her
hand
,
you
saw
,
in
each
,
such
a
capital
miniature
of
yourself
,
representing
you
as
such
a
restless
,
flashing
,
eager
,
brilliant
little
fellow
---
    
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
if
you
could
only
have
kept
them
for
your
own
miniature
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
wicked
,
roving
,
restless
,
too
impartial
eyes
<EOS>
,
it
was
enough
for
any
one
to
stand
before
them
,
and
,
straightway
,
there
he
danced
and
sparkled
quite
as
merrily
as
you
!
   
<EOS>
The
table
was
already
spread
for
dinner
;
and
though
it
was
spread
with
nothing
very
choice
in
the
way
of
glass
or
linen
,
and
with
green
-
handled
knives
,
and
very
mountebanks
of
two
-
pronged
forks
,
which
seemed
to
be
trying
how
far
asunder
they
could
possibly
stretch
their
legs
without
converting
themselves
into
double
the
number
of
iron
toothpicks
,
it
wanted
neither
damask
,
silver
,
gold
,
nor
china
;
no
,
nor
any
other
garniture
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
There
it
was
;
and
,
being
there
,
nothing
else
would
have
done
as
well
.
   
<EOS>
The
success
of
that
initiative
dish
;
that
first
experiment
of
hers
in
cookery
;
was
so
entire
,
<EOS>
so
unalloyed
and
perfect
,
that
John
Westlock
and
Tom
agreed
she
must
have
been
studying
the
art
in
secret
for
a
long
time
past
;
and
urged
her
to
make
a
full
confession
of
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
exceedingly
merry
over
this
jest
,
and
many
smart
things
were
said
concerning
it
;
but
John
was
not
as
fair
in
his
behaviour
as
might
have
been
expected
,
for
,
after
luring
Tom
Pinch
on
for
a
long
time
,
he
suddenly
went
over
to
the
enemy
,
and
swore
to
everything
his
sister
said
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
Tom
observed
the
same
night
before
going
to
bed
,
it
was
only
in
joke
,
and
John
had
always
been
famous
for
being
polite
to
ladies
,
even
when
he
was
quite
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Ruth
said
,
"
Oh
!
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
did
n't
say
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
how
much
three
people
may
find
to
talk
about
.
<EOS>
They
scarcely
left
off
talking
once
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
not
all
lively
chat
which
occupied
them
;
for
when
Tom
related
how
he
had
seen
Mr
Pecksniff
's
daughters
,
and
what
a
change
had
fallen
on
the
younger
,
they
were
very
serious
.
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
became
quite
absorbed
in
her
fortunes
;
asking
many
questions
of
Tom
Pinch
about
her
marriage
,
inquiring
whether
her
husband
was
the
gentleman
whom
Tom
had
brought
to
dine
with
him
at
Salisbury
;
in
what
degree
of
relationship
they
stood
towards
each
other
,
being
different
persons
;
and
taking
,
in
short
,
the
greatest
interest
in
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
then
went
into
it
,
at
full
length
;
he
told
how
Martin
had
gone
abroad
,
and
had
not
been
heard
of
for
a
long
time
;
how
Dragon
Mark
had
borne
him
company
;
how
Mr
Pecksniff
had
got
the
poor
old
doting
grandfather
into
his
power
;
and
how
he
basely
sought
the
hand
of
Mary
Graham
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
a
word
said
Tom
of
what
lay
hidden
in
his
heart
;
his
heart
,
so
deep
,
and
true
,
and
full
of
honour
,
and
yet
with
so
much
room
for
every
gentle
and
unselfish
thought
;
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
The
man
in
all
this
world
most
confident
in
his
sagacity
and
shrewdness
;
the
man
in
all
this
world
most
proud
of
his
distrust
of
other
men
,
and
having
most
to
show
in
gold
and
silver
as
the
gains
belonging
to
his
creed
;
the
meekest
favourer
of
that
wise
doctrine
,
Every
man
for
himself
,
and
God
for
us
all
(
there
being
high
wisdom
in
the
thought
that
the
Eternal
Majesty
of
Heaven
ever
was
,
or
can
be
,
on
the
side
of
selfish
lust
and
love
!
)
;
shall
never
find
,
<EOS>
oh
,
never
find
,
be
sure
of
that
,
the
time
come
home
to
him
,
when
all
his
wisdom
is
an
idiot
's
folly
,
weighed
against
a
simple
heart
!
   
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
Tom
,
it
was
simple
too
,
though
simple
in
a
different
way
,
to
be
so
eager
touching
that
same
theatre
,
of
which
John
said
,
when
tea
was
done
,
he
had
the
absolute
command
,
so
far
as
taking
parties
in
without
the
payment
of
a
sixpence
was
concerned
;
and
simpler
yet
,
perhaps
,
never
to
suspect
that
when
he
went
in
first
,
alone
,
he
paid
the
money
!
 
<EOS>
Simple
in
thee
,
dear
Tom
,
to
laugh
and
cry
so
heartily
at
such
a
sorry
show
,
so
poorly
shown
;
simple
to
be
so
happy
and
loquacious
trudging
home
with
Ruth
;
simple
to
be
so
surprised
to
find
that
merry
present
of
a
cookery
-
book
awaiting
her
in
the
parlour
next
morning
,
with
the
beef
-
steak
-
pudding
-
leaf
turned
down
and
blotted
out
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Let
the
record
stand
!
 
<EOS>
Thy
quality
of
soul
was
simple
,
simple
,
quite
contemptible
,
Tom
Pinch
!
    
<EOS>
Chapter
40
.
<EOS>
The
Pinches
make
a
new
acquaintance
,
and
have
fresh
occasion
for
surprise
and
wonder
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
ghostly
air
about
these
uninhabited
chambers
in
the
Temple
,
and
attending
every
circumstance
of
Tom
's
employment
there
,
which
had
a
strange
charm
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Every
morning
when
he
shut
his
door
at
Islington
,
he
turned
his
face
towards
an
atmosphere
of
unaccountable
fascination
,
as
surely
as
he
turned
it
to
the
London
smoke
;
and
from
that
moment
it
thickened
round
and
round
him
all
day
long
,
until
the
time
arrived
for
going
home
again
,
and
leaving
it
,
like
a
motionless
cloud
,
behind
.
   
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
Tom
,
every
morning
,
that
he
approached
this
ghostly
mist
,
and
became
enveloped
in
it
,
by
the
easiest
succession
of
degrees
imaginable
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
from
the
roar
and
rattle
of
the
streets
into
the
quiet
court
-
yards
of
the
Temple
,
was
the
first
preparation
.
<EOS>
Every
echo
of
his
footsteps
sounded
to
him
like
a
sound
from
the
old
walls
and
pavements
,
wanting
language
to
relate
the
histories
of
the
dim
,
dismal
rooms
;
to
tell
him
what
lost
documents
were
decaying
in
forgotten
corners
of
the
shut
-
up
cellars
,
from
whose
lattices
such
mouldy
sighs
came
breathing
forth
as
he
went
past
;
to
whisper
of
dark
bins
of
rare
old
wine
,
bricked
up
in
vaults
among
the
old
foundations
of
the
Halls
;
or
mutter
in
a
lower
tone
yet
darker
legends
of
the
cross
-
legged
knights
,
whose
marble
effigies
were
in
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
first
planting
of
his
foot
upon
the
staircase
of
his
dusty
office
,
all
these
mysteries
increased
;
until
,
ascending
step
by
step
,
as
Tom
ascended
,
they
attained
their
full
growth
in
the
solitary
labours
of
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
Every
day
brought
one
recurring
,
never
-
failing
source
of
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
This
employer
;
would
he
come
to
-
day
,
and
what
would
he
be
like
?
 
<EOS>
For
Tom
could
not
stop
short
at
Mr
Fips
;
he
quite
believed
that
Mr
Fips
had
spoken
truly
,
when
he
said
he
acted
for
another
;
and
what
manner
of
man
that
other
was
,
became
a
full
-
blown
flower
of
wonder
in
the
garden
of
Tom
's
fancy
,
which
never
faded
or
got
trodden
down
.
   
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
he
conceived
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
repenting
of
his
falsehood
,
might
,
by
exertion
of
his
influence
with
some
third
person
have
devised
these
means
of
giving
him
employment
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
this
idea
so
insupportable
after
what
had
taken
place
between
that
good
man
and
himself
,
that
he
confided
it
to
John
Westlock
on
the
very
same
day
;
informing
John
that
he
would
rather
ply
for
hire
as
a
porter
,
than
fall
so
low
in
his
own
esteem
as
to
accept
the
smallest
obligation
from
the
hands
of
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
But
John
assured
him
that
he
(
Tom
Pinch
)
was
far
from
doing
justice
to
the
character
of
Mr
Pecksniff
yet
,
if
he
supposed
that
gentleman
capable
of
performing
a
generous
action
;
and
that
he
might
make
his
mind
quite
easy
on
that
head
until
he
saw
the
sun
turn
green
and
the
moon
black
,
and
at
the
same
time
distinctly
perceived
with
the
naked
eye
,
twelve
first
-
rate
comets
careering
round
those
planets
.
 
<EOS>
In
which
unusual
state
of
things
,
he
said
(
and
not
before
)
,
it
might
become
not
absolutely
lunatic
to
suspect
Mr
Pecksniff
of
anything
so
monstrous
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
he
laughed
the
idea
down
completely
;
and
Tom
,
abandoning
it
,
was
thrown
upon
his
beam
-
ends
again
,
for
some
other
solution
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Tom
attended
to
his
duties
daily
,
and
made
considerable
progress
with
the
books
;
which
were
already
reduced
to
some
sort
of
order
,
and
made
a
great
appearance
in
his
fairly
-
written
catalogue
.
 
<EOS>
During
his
business
hours
,
he
indulged
himself
occasionally
with
snatches
of
reading
;
which
were
often
,
indeed
,
a
necessary
part
of
his
pursuit
;
and
as
he
usually
made
bold
to
carry
one
of
these
goblin
volumes
home
at
night
(
always
bringing
it
back
again
next
morning
,
in
case
his
strange
employer
should
appear
and
ask
what
had
become
of
it
)
,
he
led
a
happy
,
quiet
,
studious
kind
of
life
,
after
his
own
heart
.
   
<EOS>
But
though
the
books
were
never
so
interesting
,
and
never
so
full
of
novelty
to
Tom
,
they
could
not
so
enchain
him
,
in
those
mysterious
chambers
,
as
to
render
him
unconscious
,
for
a
moment
,
of
the
lightest
sound
.
 
<EOS>
Any
footstep
on
the
flags
without
set
him
listening
attentively
and
when
it
turned
into
that
house
,
and
came
up
,
up
,
up
the
stairs
,
he
always
thought
with
a
beating
heart
,
"
Now
I
am
coming
face
to
face
with
him
at
last
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
no
footstep
ever
passed
the
floor
immediately
below
:
except
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
This
mystery
and
loneliness
engendered
fancies
in
Tom
's
mind
,
the
folly
of
which
his
common
sense
could
readily
discover
,
but
which
his
common
sense
was
quite
unable
to
keep
away
,
notwithstanding
;
that
quality
being
with
most
of
us
,
in
such
a
case
,
like
the
old
French
Police
---
quick
at
detection
,
but
very
weak
as
a
preventive
power
.
 
<EOS>
Misgivings
,
undefined
,
absurd
,
inexplicable
,
that
there
was
some
one
hiding
in
the
inner
room
---
walking
softly
overhead
,
peeping
in
through
the
door
-
chink
,
doing
something
stealthy
,
anywhere
where
he
was
not
---
came
over
him
a
hundred
times
a
day
,
making
it
pleasant
to
throw
up
the
sash
,
and
hold
communication
even
with
the
sparrows
who
had
built
in
the
roof
and
water
-
spout
,
and
were
twittering
about
the
windows
all
day
long
.
   
<EOS>
He
sat
with
the
outer
door
wide
open
,
at
all
times
,
that
he
might
hear
the
footsteps
as
they
entered
,
and
turned
off
into
the
chambers
on
the
lower
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
formed
odd
prepossessions
too
,
regarding
strangers
in
the
streets
;
and
would
say
within
himself
of
such
or
such
a
man
,
who
struck
him
as
having
anything
uncommon
in
his
dress
or
aspect
,
"
I
should
n't
wonder
,
now
,
if
that
were
he
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
it
never
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
he
actually
turned
back
and
followed
more
than
one
of
these
suspected
individuals
,
in
a
singular
belief
that
they
were
going
to
the
place
he
was
then
upon
his
way
from
,
he
never
got
any
other
satisfaction
by
it
,
than
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
it
was
not
the
case
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fips
,
of
Austin
Friars
,
rather
deepened
than
illumined
the
obscurity
of
his
position
;
for
on
the
first
occasion
of
Tom
's
waiting
on
him
to
receive
his
weekly
pay
,
he
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
by
the
bye
,
Mr
Pinch
,
you
need
n't
mention
it
,
if
you
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
thought
he
was
going
to
tell
him
a
secret
;
so
he
said
that
he
would
n't
on
any
account
,
and
that
Mr
Fips
might
entirely
depend
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
Mr
Fips
said
"
Very
good
,
"
in
reply
,
and
nothing
more
,
Tom
prompted
him
:
   
"
Not
on
any
account
,
"
repeated
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fips
repeated
:
"
Very
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
going
to
say
"
---
Tom
hinted
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
no
!
"
cried
Fips
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
However
,
seeing
Tom
confused
,
he
added
,
"
I
mean
that
you
need
n't
mention
any
particulars
about
your
place
of
employment
,
to
people
generally
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
find
it
better
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
my
employer
yet
,
sir
,
"
observed
Tom
,
putting
his
week
's
salary
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
?
"
said
Fips
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
suppose
you
have
though
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
thank
him
,
and
to
know
that
what
I
have
done
so
far
,
is
done
to
his
satisfaction
,
"
faltered
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
right
,
"
said
Mr
Fips
,
with
a
yawn
.
 
<EOS>
"
Highly
creditable
.
 
<EOS>
Very
proper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
hastily
resolved
to
try
him
on
another
tack
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
have
finished
with
the
books
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
will
not
terminate
my
engagement
,
sir
,
or
render
me
useless
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
!
"
retorted
Fips
.
 
<EOS>
"
Plenty
to
do
;
plen
-
ty
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
Be
careful
how
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
rather
dark
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
very
utmost
extent
of
information
Tom
could
ever
get
out
of
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
was
dark
enough
in
all
conscience
;
and
if
Mr
Fips
expressed
himself
with
a
double
meaning
,
he
had
good
reason
for
doing
so
.
   
<EOS>
But
now
a
circumstance
occurred
,
which
helped
to
divert
Tom
's
thoughts
from
even
this
mystery
,
and
to
divide
them
between
it
and
a
new
channel
,
which
was
a
very
Nile
in
itself
.
   
<EOS>
The
way
it
came
about
was
this
.
 
<EOS>
Having
always
been
an
early
riser
and
having
now
no
organ
to
engage
him
in
sweet
converse
every
morning
,
it
was
his
habit
to
take
a
long
walk
before
going
to
the
Temple
;
and
naturally
inclining
,
as
a
stranger
,
towards
those
parts
of
the
town
which
were
conspicuous
for
the
life
and
animation
pervading
them
,
he
became
a
great
frequenter
of
the
market
-
places
,
bridges
,
quays
,
and
especially
the
steam
-
boat
wharves
;
for
it
was
very
lively
and
fresh
to
see
the
people
hurrying
away
upon
their
many
schemes
of
business
or
pleasure
,
and
it
made
Tom
glad
to
think
that
there
was
that
much
change
and
freedom
in
the
monotonous
routine
of
city
lives
.
   
<EOS>
In
most
of
these
morning
excursions
<EOS>
Ruth
accompanied
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
their
landlord
was
always
up
and
away
at
his
business
(
whatever
that
might
be
,
no
one
seemed
to
know
)
at
a
very
early
hour
,
the
habits
of
the
people
of
the
house
in
which
they
lodged
corresponded
with
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
they
had
often
finished
their
breakfast
,
and
were
out
in
the
summer
air
,
by
seven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
two
hours
'
stroll
they
parted
at
some
convenient
point
;
Tom
going
to
the
Temple
,
and
his
sister
returning
home
,
as
methodically
as
you
please
.
   
<EOS>
Many
and
many
a
pleasant
stroll
they
had
in
Covent
Garden
Market
;
snuffing
up
the
perfume
of
the
fruits
and
flowers
,
wondering
at
the
magnificence
of
the
pineapples
and
melons
;
catching
glimpses
down
side
avenues
,
of
rows
and
rows
of
old
women
,
seated
on
inverted
baskets
,
shelling
peas
;
looking
unutterable
things
at
the
fat
bundles
of
asparagus
with
which
the
dainty
shops
were
fortified
as
with
a
breastwork
;
and
,
at
the
herbalist
's
doors
,
gratefully
inhaling
scents
as
of
veal
-
stuffing
yet
uncooked
,
dreamily
mixed
up
with
capsicums
,
brown
-
paper
,
seeds
,
even
with
hints
of
lusty
snails
and
fine
young
curly
leeches
.
 
<EOS>
Many
and
many
a
pleasant
stroll
they
had
among
the
poultry
markets
,
where
ducks
and
fowls
,
with
necks
unnaturally
long
,
lay
stretched
out
in
pairs
,
ready
for
cooking
;
where
there
were
speckled
eggs
in
mossy
baskets
,
white
country
sausages
beyond
impeachment
by
surviving
cat
or
dog
,
or
horse
or
donkey
;
new
cheeses
to
any
wild
extent
,
live
birds
in
coops
and
cages
,
looking
much
too
big
to
be
natural
,
in
consequence
of
those
receptacles
being
much
too
little
;
rabbits
,
alive
and
dead
,
innumerable
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
pleasant
stroll
they
had
among
the
cool
,
refreshing
,
silvery
fish
-
stalls
,
with
a
kind
of
moonlight
effect
about
their
stock
-
in
-
trade
,
excepting
always
for
the
ruddy
lobsters
.
<EOS>
Many
a
pleasant
stroll
among
the
waggon
-
loads
of
fragrant
hay
,
beneath
which
dogs
and
tired
waggoners
lay
fast
asleep
,
oblivious
of
the
pieman
and
the
public
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
never
half
so
good
a
stroll
as
down
among
the
steamboats
on
a
bright
morning
.
   
<EOS>
There
they
lay
,
alongside
of
each
other
;
hard
and
fast
for
ever
,
to
all
appearance
,
but
designing
to
get
out
somehow
,
and
quite
confident
of
doing
it
;
and
in
that
faith
shoals
of
passengers
,
and
heaps
of
luggage
,
were
proceeding
hurriedly
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
Little
steam
-
boats
dashed
up
and
down
the
stream
incessantly
.
 
<EOS>
Tiers
upon
tiers
of
vessels
,
scores
of
masts
,
labyrinths
of
tackle
,
idle
sails
,
splashing
oars
,
gliding
row
-
boats
,
lumbering
barges
,
sunken
piles
,
with
ugly
lodgings
for
the
water
-
rat
within
their
mud
-
discoloured
nooks
;
church
steeples
,
warehouses
,
house
-
roofs
,
arches
,
bridges
,
men
and
women
,
children
,
casks
,
cranes
,
boxes
horses
,
coaches
,
idlers
,
and
hard
-
labourers
;
there
they
were
,
<EOS>
all
jumbled
up
together
,
any
summer
morning
,
far
beyond
Tom
's
power
of
separation
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
turmoil
there
was
an
incessant
roar
from
every
packet
's
funnel
,
which
quite
expressed
and
carried
out
the
uppermost
emotion
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
appeared
to
be
perspiring
and
bothering
themselves
,
exactly
as
their
passengers
did
;
they
never
left
off
fretting
and
chafing
,
in
their
own
hoarse
manner
,
once
;
but
were
always
panting
out
,
without
any
stops
,
"
Come
along
do
make
<EOS>
haste
<EOS>
I
'm
very
nervous
come
along
<EOS>
oh
<EOS>
good
gracious
<EOS>
we
shall
never
get
there
how
late
you
are
<EOS>
do
make
haste
<EOS>
I
'm
off
directly
come
along
!
"
   
<EOS>
Even
when
they
had
left
off
,
and
had
got
safely
out
into
the
current
,
on
the
smallest
provocation
they
began
again
;
for
the
bravest
packet
of
them
all
,
being
stopped
by
some
entanglement
in
the
river
,
would
immediately
begin
to
fume
and
pant
afresh
,
"
oh
here
's
a
stoppage
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
do
go
on
there
<EOS>
I
'm
in
a
hurry
it
's
done
on
purpose
<EOS>
did
you
ever
<EOS>
oh
my
goodness
DO
go
on
here
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
in
a
state
of
mind
bordering
on
distraction
,
would
be
last
seen
drifting
slowly
through
the
mist
into
the
summer
light
beyond
,
that
made
it
red
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
ship
,
however
;
or
,
at
least
,
the
packet
-
boat
in
which
Tom
and
his
sister
took
the
greatest
interest
on
one
particular
occasion
;
was
not
off
yet
,
by
any
means
;
but
was
at
the
height
of
its
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
The
press
of
passengers
was
very
great
;
another
steam
-
boat
lay
on
each
side
of
her
;
the
gangways
were
choked
up
;
distracted
women
,
obviously
bound
for
Gravesend
,
but
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
all
representations
that
this
particular
vessel
was
about
to
sail
for
Antwerp
,
persisted
in
secreting
baskets
of
refreshments
behind
bulk
-
heads
,
and
water
-
casks
,
and
under
seats
;
and
very
great
confusion
prevailed
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
so
amusing
,
that
Tom
,
with
Ruth
upon
his
arm
,
stood
looking
down
from
the
wharf
,
as
nearly
regardless
as
it
was
in
the
nature
of
flesh
and
blood
to
be
,
of
an
elderly
lady
behind
him
,
who
had
brought
a
large
umbrella
with
her
,
and
did
n't
know
what
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
tremendous
instrument
had
a
hooked
handle
;
and
its
vicinity
was
first
made
known
to
him
by
a
painful
pressure
on
the
windpipe
,
consequent
upon
its
having
caught
him
round
the
throat
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
disengaging
himself
with
perfect
good
humour
,
he
had
a
sensation
of
the
ferule
in
his
back
;
immediately
afterwards
,
of
the
hook
entangling
his
ankles
;
then
of
the
umbrella
generally
,
wandering
about
his
hat
,
and
flapping
at
it
like
a
great
bird
;
and
,
lastly
,
of
a
poke
or
thrust
below
the
ribs
,
which
give
him
such
exceeding
anguish
,
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
turning
round
to
offer
a
mild
remonstrance
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
his
turning
round
,
he
found
the
owner
of
the
umbrella
struggling
on
tip
-
toe
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
violent
animosity
,
to
look
down
upon
the
steam
-
boats
;
from
which
he
inferred
that
she
had
attacked
him
,
standing
in
the
front
row
,
by
design
,
and
as
her
natural
enemy
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
very
ill
-
natured
person
you
must
be
!
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
The
lady
cried
out
fiercely
,
"
<EOS>
Where
's
the
pelisse
!
"
<EOS>
---
meaning
the
constabulary
---
and
went
on
to
say
,
shaking
the
handle
of
the
umbrella
at
Tom
,
that
but
for
them
fellers
never
being
in
the
way
when
they
was
wanted
,
she
'd
have
given
him
in
charge
,
she
would
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
they
greased
their
whiskers
less
,
and
minded
the
duties
which
they
're
paid
so
heavy
for
,
a
little
more
,
"
she
observed
,
"
no
one
need
n't
be
drove
mad
by
scrouding
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
been
grievously
knocked
about
,
no
doubt
,
for
her
bonnet
<EOS>
was
bent
into
the
shape
of
a
cocked
hat
.
 
<EOS>
Being
a
fat
little
woman
,
too
,
she
was
in
a
state
of
great
exhaustion
and
intense
heat
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
pursuing
the
altercation
,
therefore
,
Tom
civilly
inquired
what
boat
she
wanted
to
go
on
board
of
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
"
as
nobody
but
yourself
can
want
to
look
at
a
steam
package
,
without
wanting
to
go
a
-
boarding
of
it
,
can
they
!
 
<EOS>
Booby
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
one
do
you
want
to
look
at
then
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
make
room
for
you
if
we
can
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
so
ill
-
tempered
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
blessed
creetur
as
ever
<EOS>
I
was
with
in
trying
times
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
somewhat
softened
,
"
and
they
're
a
many
in
their
numbers
,
ever
brought
it
as
a
charge
again
myself
that
I
was
anythin
'
but
mild
and
equal
in
my
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
a
contradicting
of
me
,
if
you
seem
to
feel
it
does
you
<EOS>
good
,
<EOS>
ma'am
,
I
often
says
,
for
well
you
know
that
Sairey
may
be
trusted
not
to
give
it
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
denige
that
I
am
worrited
and
wexed
this
day
,
and
with
good
reagion
,
Lord
forbid
!
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Mrs
Gamp
(
for
it
was
no
other
than
that
experienced
practitioner
)
had
,
with
Tom
's
assistance
,
squeezed
and
worked
herself
into
a
small
corner
between
Ruth
and
the
rail
;
where
,
after
breathing
very
hard
for
some
little
time
,
and
performing
a
short
series
of
dangerous
evolutions
with
her
umbrella
,
she
managed
to
establish
herself
pretty
comfortably
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
which
of
all
them
smoking
monsters
is
the
Ankworks
boat
,
I
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Goodness
me
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
boat
did
you
want
?
"
asked
Ruth
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Ankworks
package
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
deceive
you
,
my
sweet
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
Antwerp
packet
in
the
middle
,
"
said
Ruth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
wish
it
was
in
Jonadge
's
belly
<EOS>
,
I
do
,
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
;
appearing
to
confound
the
prophet
with
the
whale
in
this
miraculous
aspiration
.
   
<EOS>
Ruth
said
nothing
in
reply
;
but
,
as
Mrs
Gamp
,
laying
her
chin
against
the
cool
iron
of
the
rail
,
continued
to
look
intently
at
the
Antwerp
boat
,
and
every
now
and
then
to
give
a
little
groan
,
she
inquired
whether
any
child
of
hers
was
going
aboard
that
morning
?
<EOS>
Or
perhaps
her
husband
,
she
said
kindly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
shows
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
casting
up
her
eyes
,
"
what
a
little
way
you
've
travelled
into
this
wale
of
life
,
my
dear
young
creetur

<EOS>
As
a
good
friend
of
mine
has
frequent
made
remark
to
me
,
which
her
name
,
my
love
,
is

Mrs
Harris
through
the
square
and
up
the
steps
a
-
turnin
'
round
by
the
tobacker
shop
,
"
Oh
Sairey

Sairey

Mrs

ma'am

I

"
not

more

<EOS>
Our

I
says
,
"
respectin

wot
the

"
 
<EOS>

Sairey

says
Mrs
Harris
,
in
a
awful
way
<EOS>
,
"
Tell

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No

Mrs

I
says
to
her
,
"
ex

cuge
me

if
you
please

<EOS>
My
own
,
"
I
says
,
"
has
fallen
out
of
three
-
pair
backs
,
and
had
damp
doorsteps
settled
on
their
lungs
,
and
one
was
turned
up
smilin
'
in
a
bedstead
unbeknown
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
ma'am
,
"
I
says
,
"
seek
not
to
proticipate
,
but
take
'em
as
they
come
<EOS>
and
as
they
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mine
,
"
says
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
mine
is
all
gone
,
<EOS>
my
dear
young
chick
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
husbands
,
there
's
a
wooden
leg
<EOS>
gone
likeways
home
to
its
account
,
which
in
its
constancy
of
walkin
'
into
wine
vaults
,
and
never
comin
'
out
again
"
till
fetched
by
force
,
was
quite
as
weak
as
flesh
,
if
not
weaker
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
When
she
had
delivered
this
oration
,
Mrs
Gamp
leaned
her
chin
upon
the
cool
iron
again
;
and
looking
intently
at
the
Antwerp
packet
,
shook
her
head
and
groaned
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
I
would
n't
be
a
man
and
have
such
a
think
upon
my
mind
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
nobody
as
owned
the
name
of
man
,
could
do
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
and
his
sister
glanced
at
each
other
;
and
Ruth
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
asked
Mrs
Gamp
what
troubled
her
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
returned
that
lady
,
dropping
her
voice
,
"
you
are
single
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Ruth
laughed
blushed
,
and
said
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Worse
luck
,
"
proceeded
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
for
all
parties
!
 
<EOS>
But
others
is
married
,
and
in
the
marriage
state
;
and
there
is
a
dear
young
creetur
a
-
comin
'
down
this
mornin
'
to
that
very
package
,
which
is
no
more
fit
to
trust
herself
to
sea
,
than
nothin'
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
paused
here
to
look
over
the
deck
of
the
packet
in
question
,
and
on
the
steps
leading
down
to
it
,
and
on
the
gangways
.
 
<EOS>
Seeming
to
have
thus
assured
herself
that
the
object
of
her
commiseration
had
not
yet
arrived
,
she
raised
her
eyes
gradually
up
to
the
top
of
the
escape
-
pipe
,
and
indignantly
apostrophised
the
vessel
:
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
drat
you
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
shaking
her
umbrella
at
it
,
"
you
're
a
nice
spluttering
nisy
monster
for
a
delicate
young
creetur
to
go
and
be
a
passinger
by
;
ai
n't
you
!
 
<EOS>
YOU
never
do
no
harm
in
that
way
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
With
your
hammering
,
and
roaring
,
and
hissing
,
and
lamp
-
iling
,
you
brute
!
 
<EOS>
Them
Confugion
steamers
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
shaking
her
umbrella
again
,
"
has
done
more
to
throw
us
out
of
our
reg'lar
work
and
bring
ewents
on
at
times
when
nobody
counted
on
'em
(
<EOS>
especially
them
screeching
railroad
ones
)
,
than
all
the
other
frights
that
ever
was
took
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heerd
of
one
young
man
,
a
guard
upon
a
railway
,
only
three
years
opened
---
<EOS>
well
does
Mrs
Harris
know
him
,
which
indeed
he
is
her
own
relation
by
her
sister
's
marriage
with
a
master
sawyer
---
as
is
godfather
at
this
present
time
to
six
-
and
-
twenty
blessed
little
strangers
,
equally
unexpected
,
and
all
on
"
um
named
after
the
Ingeines
as
was
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Ugh
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
resuming
her
apostrophe
<EOS>
,
"
one
might
easy
know
you
was
a
man
's
inwention
,
from
your
disregardlessness
of
the
weakness
of
our
naturs
,
so
one
might
,
you
brute
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
been
unnatural
to
suppose
,
from
the
first
part
of
Mrs
Gamp
's
lamentations
,
that
she
was
connected
with
the
stage
-
coaching
or
post
-
horsing
trade
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
means
of
judging
of
the
effect
of
her
concluding
remarks
upon
her
young
companion
;
for
she
interrupted
herself
at
this
point
,
and
exclaimed
:
   
"
There
she
identically
goes
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
sweet
young
creetur
,
there
she
goes
,
like
a
lamb
to
the
sacrifige
!
 
<EOS>
If
there
's
any
illness
when
that
wessel
gets
to
sea
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
prophetically
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
murder
,
and
I
'm
the
witness
for
the
persecution
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
so
very
earnest
on
the
subject
,
that
Tom
's
sister
(
being
as
kind
as
Tom
himself
)
could
not
help
saying
something
to
her
in
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
which
is
the
lady
,
"
she
inquired
,
"
in
whom
you
are
so
much
interested
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
groaned
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
she
goes
!
 
<EOS>
A
-
crossin
'
the
little
wooden
bridge
at
this
minute
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
a
-
slippin
'
on
a
bit
of
orangepeel
!
"
<EOS>
tightly
clutching
her
umbrella
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
turn
it
give
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
the
lady
who
is
with
that
man
wrapped
up
from
head
to
foot
in
a
large
cloak
,
so
that
his
face
is
almost
hidden
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
he
may
hide
it
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
good
call
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
see
him
a
-
jerking
of
her
wrist
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
seems
to
be
hasty
with
her
,
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
he
's
a
-
taking
of
her
down
into
the
close
cabin
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
man
about
!
 
<EOS>
The
deuce
is
in
him
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
he
leave
her
in
the
open
air
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
not
,
whatever
his
reason
was
,
but
led
her
quickly
down
and
disappeared
himself
,
without
loosening
his
cloak
,
or
pausing
on
the
crowded
deck
one
moment
longer
than
was
necessary
to
clear
their
way
to
that
part
of
the
vessel
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
had
not
heard
this
little
dialogue
;
for
his
attention
had
been
engaged
in
an
unexpected
manner
.
 
<EOS>
A
hand
upon
his
sleeve
had
caused
him
to
look
round
,
just
when
Mrs
Gamp
concluded
her
apostrophe
to
the
steam
-
engine
;
and
on
his
right
arm
,
Ruth
being
on
his
left
,
he
found
their
landlord
,
to
his
great
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
much
surprised
at
the
man
's
being
there
,
as
at
his
having
got
close
to
him
so
quietly
and
swiftly
;
for
another
person
had
been
at
his
elbow
<EOS>
one
instant
before
;
and
he
had
not
in
the
meantime
been
conscious
of
any
change
or
pressure
in
the
knot
of
people
among
whom
he
stood
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Ruth
had
frequently
remarked
how
noiselessly
this
landlord
of
theirs
came
into
and
went
out
of
his
own
house
;
but
Tom
was
not
the
less
amazed
to
see
him
at
his
elbow
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
he
said
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
rather
infirm
,
and
out
of
breath
,
and
my
eyes
are
not
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
as
young
as
I
was
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
see
a
gentleman
in
a
large
cloak
down
yonder
,
with
a
lady
on
his
arm
;
a
lady
in
a
veil
and
a
black
shawl
;
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
If
HE
did
not
,
it
was
curious
that
in
speaking
he
should
have
singled
out
from
all
the
crowd
the
very
people
whom
he
described
;
and
should
have
glanced
hastily
from
them
to
Tom
,
as
if
he
were
burning
to
direct
his
wandering
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
in
a
large
cloak
!
"
said
Tom
,
"
and
a
lady
in
a
black
shawl
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
!
"
replied
the
other
,
with
keen
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
muffled
up
from
head
to
foot
---
strangely
muffled
up
for
such
a
morning
as
this
---
like
an
invalid
,
with
his
hand
to
his
face
at
this
minute
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
not
there
,
"
he
added
,
following
Tom
's
gaze
;
<EOS>
"
the
other
way
;
in
that
direction
;
down
yonder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Again
he
indicated
,
but
<EOS>
this
time
in
his
hurry
,
with
his
outstretched
finger
,
the
very
spot
on
which
the
progress
of
these
persons
was
checked
at
that
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
so
many
people
,
and
so
much
motion
,
and
so
many
objects
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
that
I
find
it
difficult
to
---
<EOS>
no
,
I
really
do
n't
see
a
gentleman
in
a
large
cloak
,
and
a
lady
in
a
black
shawl
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
lady
in
a
red
shawl
over
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
cried
his
landlord
,
pointing
eagerly
again
,
"
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
way
;
the
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
the
cabin
steps
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
be
near
the
cabin
steps
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
the
cabin
steps
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
the
bell
ringing
already
!
 
<EOS>
DO
you
see
the
steps
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
"
you
're
right
.
 
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
there
they
go
now
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
the
gentleman
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Descending
at
this
minute
,
with
the
folds
of
a
great
cloak
trailing
down
after
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
man
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
other
,
not
looking
at
what
Tom
pointed
out
,
however
,
but
at
Tom
's
own
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
do
me
a
kindness
,
sir
,
a
great
kindness
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
put
that
letter
in
his
hand
?
 
<EOS>
Only
give
him
that
!
 
<EOS>
He
expects
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
charged
to
do
it
by
my
employers
,
but
I
am
late
in
finding
him
,
and
,
not
being
as
young
as
I
have
been
,
should
never
be
able
to
make
my
way
on
board
and
off
the
deck
again
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
pardon
my
boldness
,
and
do
me
that
great
kindness
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
hands
shook
,
and
his
face
bespoke
the
utmost
interest
and
agitation
,
as
he
pressed
the
letter
upon
Tom
,
and
pointed
to
its
destination
,
like
the
Tempter
in
some
grim
old
carving
.
   
<EOS>
To
hesitate
in
the
performance
of
a
good
-
natured
or
compassionate
office
was
not
in
Tom
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
letter
;
whispered
Ruth
to
wait
till
he
returned
,
which
would
be
immediately
;
and
ran
down
the
steps
with
all
the
expedition
he
could
make
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
so
many
people
going
down
,
so
many
others
coming
up
,
such
heavy
goods
in
course
of
transit
to
and
fro
,
such
a
ringing
of
bell
,
blowing
-
off
of
steam
,
and
shouting
of
men
's
voices
,
that
he
had
much
ado
to
force
his
way
,
or
keep
in
mind
to
which
boat
he
was
going
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
reached
the
right
one
with
good
speed
,
and
going
down
the
cabin
-
stairs
immediately
,
described
the
object
of
his
search
standing
at
the
upper
end
of
the
saloon
,
with
his
back
towards
him
,
reading
some
notice
which
was
hung
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
As
Tom
advanced
to
give
him
the
letter
,
he
started
,
hearing
footsteps
,
and
turned
round
.
   
<EOS>
What
was
Tom
's
astonishment
to
find
in
him
the
man
with
whom
he
had
had
the
conflict
in
the
field
---
poor
Mercy
's
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
!
   
<EOS>
Tom
understood
him
to
say
,
what
the
devil
did
he
want
;
but
it
was
not
easy
to
make
out
what
he
said
;
he
spoke
so
indistinctly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
nothing
with
you
for
myself
,
"
said
Tom
;
<EOS>
"
I
was
asked
,
a
moment
since
,
to
give
you
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
pointed
out
to
me
,
but
I
did
n't
know
you
in
your
strange
dress
.
 
<EOS>
Take
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
opened
it
,
and
read
the
writing
on
the
inside
.
 
<EOS>
The
contents
were
evidently
very
brief
;
not
more
perhaps
than
one
line
;
but
they
struck
upon
him
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
.
 
<EOS>
He
reeled
back
as
he
read
.
   
<EOS>
His
emotion
was
so
different
from
any
Tom
had
ever
seen
before
that
he
stopped
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
Momentary
as
his
state
of
indecision
was
,
the
bell
ceased
while
he
stood
there
,
and
a
hoarse
voice
calling
down
the
steps
,
inquired
if
there
was
any
to
go
ashore
?
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
cried
Jonas
,
"
I
---
I
am
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
time
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
that
woman
!
 
<EOS>
Come
back
;
come
back
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
threw
open
another
door
as
he
spoke
,
and
dragged
,
rather
than
led
,
her
forth
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
pale
and
frightened
,
and
amazed
to
see
her
old
acquaintance
;
but
had
no
time
to
speak
,
for
they
were
making
a
great
stir
above
;
and
Jonas
drew
her
rapidly
towards
the
deck
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
we
going
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
going
back
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
changed
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
go
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
question
me
,
or
I
shall
be
the
death
of
you
,
or
some
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
Stop
there
!
 
<EOS>
Stop
!
 
<EOS>
We
're
for
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
 
<EOS>
We
're
for
the
shore
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
turned
,
even
in
the
madness
of
his
hurry
,
and
scowling
darkly
back
at
Tom
,
shook
his
clenched
hand
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
not
many
human
faces
capable
of
the
expression
with
which
he
accompanied
that
gesture
.
   
<EOS>
He
dragged
her
up
,
and
Tom
followed
them
.
 
<EOS>
Across
the
deck
,
over
the
side
,
along
the
crazy
plank
,
and
up
the
steps
,
he
dragged
her
fiercely
;
not
bestowing
any
look
on
her
,
but
gazing
upwards
all
the
while
among
the
faces
on
the
wharf
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
turned
again
,
and
said
to
Tom
with
a
tremendous
oath
:
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
Before
Tom
,
in
his
indignation
and
amazement
,
could
return
an
answer
to
a
question
he
so
little
understood
,
a
gentleman
approached
Tom
behind
,
and
saluted
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
gentleman
of
foreign
appearance
,
with
a
black
moustache
and
whiskers
;
and
addressed
him
with
a
polite
composure
,
strangely
different
from
his
own
distracted
and
desperate
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Chuzzlewit
,
my
good
fellow
!
"
said
the
gentleman
,
raising
his
hat
in
compliment
to
Mrs
Chuzzlewit
,
"
I
ask
your
pardon
twenty
thousand
times
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
most
unwilling
to
interfere
between
you
and
a
domestic
trip
of
this
nature
<EOS>
(
always
so
very
charming
and
refreshing
,
I
know
,
although
I
have
not
the
happiness
to
be
a
domestic
man
myself
,
which
is
the
great
infelicity
of
my
existence
)
;
but
the
beehive
,
my
dear
friend
,
the
beehive
---
<EOS>
will
you
introduce
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
Mr
Montague
,
"
said
Jonas
,
whom
the
words
appeared
to
choke
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
most
unhappy
and
most
penitent
of
men
,
Mrs
Chuzzlewit
,
"
pursued
that
gentleman
,
"
for
having
been
the
means
of
spoiling
this
excursion
;
but
as
I
tell
my
friend
,
the
beehive
,
the
beehive
.
 
<EOS>
You
projected
a
short
little
continental
trip
,
my
dear
friend
,
of
course
?
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
maintained
a
dogged
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
die
,
"
cried
Montague
,
"
but
I
am
shocked
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
I
am
shocked
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
confounded
beehive
of
ours
in
the
city
must
be
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
,
when
there
is
honey
to
be
made
;
and
that
is
my
best
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
a
very
singular
old
female
dropping
curtseys
on
my
right
,
"
said
Montague
,
breaking
off
in
his
discourse
,
and
looking
at
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
who
is
not
a
friend
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Does
anybody
know
her
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Well
they
knows
me
,
bless
their
precious
hearts
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
not
forgettin
'
your
own
merry
one
,
sir
,
and
long
may
it
be
so
!
 
<EOS>
Wishin
'
as
every
one
"
<EOS>
(
she
delivered
this
in
the
form
of
a
toast
or
sentiment
)
"
was
as
merry
,
and
as
handsome
-
lookin
'
,
as
a
little
bird
has
whispered
me
a
certain
gent
is
,
which
I
will
not
name
for
fear
I
give
offence
where
none
is
doo
!
 
<EOS>
My
precious
lady
,
"
here
she
stopped
short
in
her
merriment
,
for
she
had
until
now
affected
to
be
vastly
entertained
,
"
you
're
too
pale
by
half
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
are
here
too
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ecod
,
there
are
enough
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Gamp
,
dropping
an
indignant
curtsey
,
"
as
no
bones
is
broke
by
me
and
Mrs
Harris
a
-
walkin
'
down
upon
a
public
wharf
.
 
<EOS>
Which
was
the
very
words
she
says
to
me
<EOS>
(
although
they
was
the
last
I
ever
had
to
speak
)
was
these
:
"
Sairey
,
"
she
says
,
"
is
it
a
public
wharf
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Harris
<EOS>
,
"
I
makes
answer
,
"
can
you
doubt
it
?
<EOS>
You
have
know'd
me
now
,
ma'am
,
eight
and
thirty
year
;
and
did
you
ever
know
me
go
,
or
wish
to
go
,
where
I
was
not
made
welcome
,
say
the
words
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sairey
,
"
Mrs
Harris
says
,
"
contrairy
quite
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
well
she
knows
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
but
a
poor
woman
,
but
I
've
been
sought
after
,
sir
,
though
you
may
not
think
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
knocked
up
at
all
hours
of
the
night
,
and
warned
out
by
a
many
landlords
,
in
consequence
of
being
mistook
for
Fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
goes
out
workin
'
for
my
bread
,
"
tis
true
,
but
I
maintains
my
independency
,
with
your
kind
leave
,
and
which
I
will
till
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
has
my
feelins
as
a
woman
,
sir
,
and
I
have
been
a
mother
likeways
;
but
touch
a
pipkin
as
belongs
to
me
,
or
make
the
least
remarks
on
what
I
eats
or
drinks
,
and
though
you
was
the
favouritest
young
for'ard
hussy
of
a
servant
-
gal
as
ever
come
into
a
house
,
either
you
leaves
the
place
,
or
me
.
<EOS>
My
earnins
is
not
great
,
sir
,
but
I
will
not
be
impoged
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
the
babe
,
and
save
the
mother
<EOS>
,
is
my
mortar
,
sir
;
but
I
makes
so
free
as
add
to
that
,
Do
n't
try
no
impogician
with
the
Nuss
,
for
she
will
not
abear
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
concluded
by
drawing
her
shawl
tightly
over
herself
with
both
hands
,
and
,
as
usual
,
referring
to
Mrs
Harris
for
full
corroboration
of
these
particulars
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
that
peculiar
trembling
of
the
head
which
,
in
ladies
of
her
excitable
nature
,
may
be
taken
as
a
sure
indication
of
their
breaking
out
again
very
shortly
;
when
Jonas
made
a
timely
interposition
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
you
ARE
here
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
had
better
see
to
her
,
and
take
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
otherwise
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
more
;
but
looked
at
Montague
as
if
to
give
him
notice
that
he
was
ready
to
attend
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
take
you
away
,
"
said
Montague
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
gave
him
a
sinister
look
,
which
long
lived
in
Tom
's
memory
,
and
which
he
often
recalled
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
upon
my
life
,
"
said
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
make
it
necessary
?
"
   
<EOS>
With
the
same
dark
glance
as
before
,
Jonas
replied
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
necessity
is
none
of
my
making
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
brought
it
about
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
even
this
as
if
he
were
bound
,
and
in
the
other
's
power
,
but
had
a
sullen
and
suppressed
devil
within
him
,
which
he
could
not
quite
resist
.
 
<EOS>
His
very
gait
,
as
they
walked
away
together
,
was
like
that
of
a
fettered
man
;
but
,
striving
to
work
out
at
his
clenched
hands
,
knitted
brows
,
and
fast
-
set
lips
,
was
the
same
imprisoned
devil
still
.
   
<EOS>
They
got
into
a
handsome
cabriolet
which
was
waiting
for
them
and
drove
away
.
   
<EOS>
The
whole
of
this
extraordinary
scene
had
passed
so
rapidly
and
the
tumult
which
prevailed
around
as
so
unconscious
of
any
impression
from
it
,
that
,
although
Tom
had
been
one
of
the
chief
actors
,
it
was
like
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
had
noticed
him
after
they
had
left
the
packet
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
stood
behind
Jonas
,
and
so
near
him
,
that
he
could
not
help
hearing
all
that
passed
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
stood
there
,
with
his
sister
on
his
arm
,
expecting
and
hoping
to
have
an
opportunity
of
explaining
his
strange
share
in
this
yet
stranger
business
.
 
<EOS>
But
Jonas
had
not
raised
his
eyes
from
the
ground
;
no
one
else
had
even
looked
towards
him
;
and
before
he
could
resolve
on
any
course
of
action
,
they
were
all
gone
.
   
<EOS>
He
gazed
round
for
his
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
done
that
more
than
once
already
,
and
no
such
man
was
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
still
pursuing
this
search
with
his
eyes
,
when
he
saw
a
hand
beckoning
to
him
from
a
hackney
-
coach
;
and
hurrying
towards
it
,
found
it
was
Merry
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
addressed
him
hurriedly
,
but
bent
out
of
the
window
,
that
she
might
not
be
overheard
by
her
companion
,
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
heaven
,
what
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Why
did
he
tell
me
last
night
to
prepare
for
a
long
journey
,
and
why
have
you
brought
us
back
like
criminals
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Pinch
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
clasped
her
hands
distractedly
,
"
be
merciful
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
this
dreadful
secret
is
,
be
merciful
,
and
God
will
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
any
power
of
mercy
lay
with
me
,
"
cried
Tom
,
"
trust
me
,
<EOS>
you
should
n't
ask
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
far
more
ignorant
and
weak
than
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
withdrew
into
the
coach
again
,
and
he
saw
the
hand
waving
towards
him
for
a
moment
;
but
whether
in
reproachfulness
or
incredulity
or
misery
,
or
grief
,
or
sad
adieu
,
or
what
else
,
he
could
not
,
being
so
hurried
,
understand
.
 
<EOS>
SHE
was
gone
now
;
and
Ruth
and
he
were
left
to
walk
away
,
and
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
Had
Mr
Nadgett
appointed
the
man
who
never
came
,
to
meet
him
upon
London
Bridge
that
morning
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
certainly
looking
over
the
parapet
,
and
down
upon
the
steamboat
-
wharf
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
have
been
for
pleasure
;
he
never
took
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
had
some
business
there
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
41
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
and
his
friend
,
arriving
at
a
pleasant
understanding
,
set
forth
upon
an
enterprise
 
<EOS>
The
office
of
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
Disinterested
Loan
and
Life
Assurance
Company
being
near
at
hand
,
and
Mr
Montague
driving
Jonas
straight
there
,
they
had
very
little
way
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
journey
might
have
been
one
of
several
hours
'
duration
,
without
provoking
a
remark
from
either
;
for
it
was
clear
that
Jonas
did
not
mean
to
break
the
silence
which
prevailed
between
them
,
and
that
it
was
not
,
as
yet
,
his
dear
friend
's
cue
to
tempt
them
into
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
thrown
aside
his
cloak
,
as
having
now
no
motive
for
concealment
,
and
with
that
garment
huddled
on
his
knees
,
sat
as
far
removed
from
his
companion
as
the
limited
space
in
such
a
carriage
would
allow
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
striking
difference
in
his
manner
,
compared
with
what
it
had
been
,
within
a
few
minutes
,
when
Tom
encountered
him
so
unexpectedly
on
board
the
packet
,
or
when
the
ugly
change
had
fallen
on
him
in
Mr
Montague
's
dressing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
aspect
of
a
man
found
out
and
held
at
bay
;
of
being
baffled
,
hunted
,
and
beset
;
but
there
was
now
a
dawning
and
increasing
purpose
in
his
face
,
which
changed
it
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
gloomy
,
distrustful
,
lowering
;
pale
with
anger
and
defeat
;
it
still
was
humbled
,
abject
,
cowardly
and
mean
;
but
,
let
the
conflict
go
on
as
it
would
,
there
was
one
strong
purpose
wrestling
with
every
emotion
of
his
mind
,
and
casting
the
whole
series
down
as
they
arose
.
   
<EOS>
Not
prepossessing
in
appearance
at
the
best
of
times
,
it
may
be
readily
supposed
that
he
was
not
so
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
left
deep
marks
of
his
front
teeth
in
his
nether
lip
;
and
those
tokens
of
the
agitation
he
had
lately
undergone
improved
his
looks
as
little
as
the
heavy
corrugations
in
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
self
-
possessed
now
;
unnaturally
self
-
possessed
,
indeed
,
as
men
quite
otherwise
than
brave
are
known
to
be
in
desperate
extremities
;
and
when
the
carriage
stopped
,
he
waited
for
no
invitation
,
but
leapt
hardily
out
,
and
went
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
The
chairman
followed
him
;
and
closing
the
board
-
room
door
as
soon
as
they
had
entered
,
threw
himself
upon
a
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
stood
before
the
window
,
looking
down
into
the
street
;
and
leaned
against
the
sash
,
resting
his
head
upon
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
handsome
,
Chuzzlewit
!
"
said
Montague
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
handsome
upon
my
soul
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
me
do
?
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
looking
round
abruptly
;
"
What
do
you
expect
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Confidence
,
my
good
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Some
confidence
!
<EOS>
"
said
Montague
in
an
injured
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
 
<EOS>
You
show
great
confidence
in
me
,
"
retorted
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
not
?
"
said
his
companion
,
raising
his
head
,
and
looking
at
him
,
but
he
had
turned
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
Have
I
not
confided
to
you
the
easy
schemes
I
have
formed
for
our
advantage
;
OUR
advantage
,
mind
;
not
mine
alone
;
and
what
is
my
return
?
 
<EOS>
Attempted
flight
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
 
<EOS>
Who
said
I
meant
to
fly
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
said
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
.
 
<EOS>
A
foreign
boat
,
my
friend
,
an
early
hour
,
a
figure
wrapped
up
for
disguise
!
 
<EOS>
Who
said
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
did
n't
mean
to
jilt
me
,
why
were
you
there
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
did
n't
mean
to
jilt
me
,
why
did
you
come
back
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
back
,
"
said
Jonas
,
"
to
avoid
disturbance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
wise
,
"
rejoined
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
stood
quite
silent
;
still
looking
down
into
the
street
,
and
resting
his
head
upon
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Chuzzlewit
,
"
said
Montague
,
"
notwithstanding
what
has
passed
I
will
be
plain
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
attending
to
me
there
?
 
<EOS>
I
only
see
your
back
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
that
notwithstanding
what
has
passed
,
I
will
be
plain
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
said
that
before
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
told
you
once
I
heard
you
say
it
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
little
chafed
,
but
I
can
make
allowance
for
that
,
and
am
,
fortunately
,
myself
in
the
very
best
of
tempers
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
let
us
see
how
circumstances
stand
.
 
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
ago
,
I
mentioned
to
you
,
my
dear
fellow
,
that
I
thought
I
had
discovered
---
"
   
"
Will
you
hold
your
tongue
?
"
said
Jonas
,
looking
fiercely
round
,
and
glancing
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
said
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
"
Judicious
!
 
<EOS>
Quite
correct
!
 
<EOS>
My
discoveries
being
published
,
would
be
like
many
other
men
's
discoveries
in
this
honest
world
;
of
no
further
use
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
Chuzzlewit
,
how
ingenuous
and
frank
<EOS>
I
am
in
showing
you
the
weakness
of
my
own
position
!
 
<EOS>
To
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
,
or
think
I
make
,
a
certain
discovery
which
I
take
an
early
opportunity
of
mentioning
in
your
ear
,
in
that
spirit
of
confidence
which
I
really
hoped
did
prevail
between
us
,
and
was
reciprocated
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
is
something
in
it
;
perhaps
there
is
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
knowledge
and
opinion
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
yours
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
discuss
the
question
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
good
fellow
,
you
have
been
weak
;
what
I
wish
to
point
out
to
you
is
,
that
you
have
been
weak
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
desire
to
turn
this
little
incident
to
my
account
<EOS>
(
indeed
,
I
do
---
<EOS>
I
'll
not
deny
it
)
,
but
my
account
does
not
lie
in
probing
it
,
or
using
it
against
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
using
it
against
me
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jonas
,
who
had
not
yet
changed
his
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Montague
,
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
not
enter
into
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Using
it
to
make
a
beggar
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
the
use
you
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
,
"
muttered
Jonas
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
use
in
which
your
account
DOES
lie
.
 
<EOS>
You
speak
the
truth
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
venture
<EOS>
(
it
's
a
very
safe
venture
)
<EOS>
a
little
more
with
us
,
certainly
,
and
to
keep
quiet
,
"
said
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
promised
me
you
would
;
and
you
must
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
plainly
,
Chuzzlewit
,
you
MUST
.
<EOS>
Reason
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
,
my
secret
is
worthless
to
me
:
and
being
so
<EOS>
,
it
may
as
well
become
the
public
property
as
mine
;
better
,
for
I
shall
gain
some
credit
,
bringing
it
to
light
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
,
besides
,
to
act
as
a
decoy
in
a
case
I
have
already
told
you
of
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mind
that
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
care
nothing
for
the
man
<EOS>
(
you
care
nothing
for
any
man
;
you
are
too
sharp
;
so
am
I
,
I
hope
)
;
and
could
bear
any
loss
of
his
with
pious
fortitude
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
tried
to
escape
from
the
first
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
escape
it
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
shown
you
that
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
not
a
moral
man
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
least
in
the
world
affected
by
anything
you
may
have
done
;
by
any
little
indiscretion
you
may
have
committed
;
but
I
wish
to
profit
by
it
if
I
can
;
and
to
a
man
of
your
intelligence
I
make
that
free
confession
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
singular
in
that
infirmity
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
profits
by
the
indiscretion
of
his
neighbour
;
and
the
people
in
the
best
repute
,
the
most
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
give
me
this
trouble
?
 
<EOS>
It
must
come
to
a
friendly
agreement
,
or
an
unfriendly
crash
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
former
,
you
are
very
little
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
latter
---
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
you
know
best
what
is
likely
to
happen
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
left
the
window
,
and
walked
up
close
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
look
him
in
the
face
;
it
was
not
his
habit
to
do
that
;
but
he
kept
his
eyes
towards
him
---
on
his
breast
,
or
thereabouts
---
and
was
at
great
pains
to
speak
slowly
and
distinctly
in
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
a
man
in
a
state
of
conscious
drunkenness
might
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lying
is
of
no
use
now
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
DID
think
of
getting
away
this
morning
,
and
making
better
terms
with
you
from
a
distance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
natural
.
<EOS>
I
foresaw
that
,
and
provided
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
afraid
I
am
interrupting
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
the
devil
,
"
pursued
Jonas
,
with
a
still
greater
effort
,
"
you
made
choice
of
your
messenger
,
and
where
you
found
him
,
I
'll
not
ask
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
owed
him
one
good
turn
before
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
so
careless
of
men
in
general
,
as
you
said
you
were
just
now
,
you
are
quite
indifferent
to
what
becomes
of
such
a
crop
-
tailed
cur
as
that
,
and
will
leave
me
to
settle
my
account
with
him
in
my
own
manner
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
he
had
raised
his
eyes
to
his
companion
's
face
,
he
would
have
seen
that
Montague
was
evidently
unable
to
comprehend
his
meaning
.
<EOS>
But
continuing
to
stand
before
him
,
with
his
furtive
gaze
directed
as
before
,
and
pausing
here
only
to
moisten
his
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
,
the
fact
was
lost
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
have
struck
a
close
observer
that
this
fixed
and
steady
glance
of
Jonas
's
was
a
part
of
the
alteration
which
had
taken
place
in
his
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
He
kept
it
riveted
on
one
spot
,
with
which
his
thoughts
had
manifestly
nothing
to
do
;
like
as
a
juggler
walking
on
a
cord
or
wire
to
any
dangerous
end
,
holds
some
object
in
his
sight
to
steady
him
,
and
never
wanders
from
it
,
lest
he
trip
.
   
<EOS>
Montague
was
quick
in
his
rejoinder
,
though
he
made
it
at
a
venture
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
difference
of
opinion
between
him
and
his
friend
on
THAT
point
.
 
<EOS>
Not
the
least
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
great
discovery
,
"
Jonas
proceeded
,
with
a
savage
sneer
that
got
the
better
of
him
for
the
moment
,
"
may
be
true
,
and
may
be
false
.
 
<EOS>
Whichever
it
is
,
I
dare
say
I
'm
no
worse
than
other
men
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
,
"
said
Tigg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
all
alike
---
or
nearly
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
this
,
"
Jonas
went
on
to
say
;
"
is
it
your
own
?
<EOS>
You
'll
not
wonder
at
my
asking
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
own
!
"
repeated
Montague
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
returned
the
other
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
known
to
anybody
else
?
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
waver
about
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Montague
,
without
the
smallest
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
would
it
be
worth
,
do
you
think
,
unless
I
had
the
keeping
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
for
the
first
time
,
Jonas
looked
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
he
put
out
his
hand
,
and
said
,
with
a
laugh
<EOS>
:
   
"
Come
!
<EOS>
make
things
easy
to
me
,
and
I
'm
yours
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
may
not
be
better
off
here
,
after
all
,
than
if
I
had
gone
away
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
I
am
,
and
here
I
'll
stay
now
.
 
<EOS>
Take
your
oath
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
cleared
his
throat
,
for
he
was
speaking
hoarsely
and
said
in
a
lighter
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
to
Pecksniff
?
 
<EOS>
When
?
 
<EOS>
Say
when
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Immediately
!
"
cried
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
be
enticed
too
soon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
with
a
wild
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
some
fun
in
catching
that
old
hypocrite
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
him
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
go
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
 
<EOS>
This
,
"
said
Montague
,
ecstatically
,
"
is
like
business
!
 
<EOS>
We
understand
each
other
now
!
 
<EOS>
To
-
night
,
my
good
fellow
,
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Come
with
me
,
"
cried
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
make
a
dash
;
go
down
in
state
,
and
carry
documents
,
for
he
's
a
deep
file
to
deal
with
,
and
must
be
drawn
on
with
an
artful
hand
,
or
he
'll
not
follow
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
ca
n't
take
your
lodgings
or
your
dinners
down
,
I
must
take
you
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
come
to
-
night
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
friend
appeared
to
hesitate
;
and
neither
to
have
anticipated
this
proposal
,
nor
to
relish
it
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
can
concert
our
plans
upon
the
road
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
go
direct
to
him
,
but
cross
over
from
some
other
place
,
and
turn
out
of
our
way
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
want
to
introduce
you
,
but
I
must
have
you
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
man
,
I
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
what
if
the
man
knows
me
?
"
said
Montague
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
know
!
"
cried
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
run
that
risk
with
fifty
men
a
day
!
 
<EOS>
Would
your
father
know
you
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
know
you
?
 
<EOS>
Ecod
!
 
<EOS>
You
were
another
figure
when
I
saw
you
first
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
rents
and
patches
now
!
 
<EOS>
No
false
hair
then
,
no
black
dye
!
 
<EOS>
You
were
another
sort
of
joker
in
those
days
,
you
were
!
 
<EOS>
You
even
spoke
different
then
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
acted
the
gentleman
so
seriously
since
,
that
you
've
taken
in
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
should
know
you
,
what
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
Such
a
change
is
a
proof
of
your
success
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
,
or
you
would
not
have
made
yourself
known
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
said
Montague
,
still
hesitating
,
"
I
can
trust
you
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Trust
me
!
 
<EOS>
Ecod
,
you
may
trust
me
now
,
far
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
to
go
away
no
more
---
no
more
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
added
in
a
more
sober
tone
,
"
I
ca
n't
get
on
without
you
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
Montague
,
"
if
that
's
your
opinion
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
they
shook
hands
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
boisterous
manner
which
Jonas
had
exhibited
during
the
latter
part
of
this
conversation
,
and
which
had
gone
on
rapidly
increasing
with
almost
every
word
he
had
spoken
,
from
the
time
when
he
looked
his
honourable
friend
in
the
face
until
now
,
did
not
now
subside
,
but
,
remaining
at
its
height
,
abided
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
Most
unusual
with
him
at
any
period
;
most
inconsistent
with
his
temper
and
constitution
;
especially
unnatural
it
would
appear
in
one
so
darkly
circumstanced
;
it
abided
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
like
the
effect
of
wine
,
or
any
ardent
drink
,
for
he
was
perfectly
coherent
.
 
<EOS>
It
even
made
him
proof
against
the
usual
influence
of
such
means
of
excitement
;
for
,
although
he
drank
deeply
several
times
that
day
,
with
no
reserve
or
caution
,
he
remained
exactly
the
same
man
,
and
his
spirits
neither
rose
nor
fell
in
the
least
observable
degree
.
   
<EOS>
Deciding
,
after
some
discussion
,
to
travel
at
night
,
in
order
that
the
day
's
business
might
not
be
broken
in
upon
,
they
took
counsel
together
in
reference
to
the
means
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
being
of
opinion
that
four
horses
were
advisable
,
at
all
events
for
the
first
stage
,
as
throwing
a
great
deal
of
dust
into
people
's
eyes
,
in
more
senses
than
one
,
a
travelling
chariot
and
four
lay
under
orders
for
nine
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
did
not
go
home
;
observing
,
that
his
being
obliged
to
leave
town
on
business
in
so
great
a
hurry
,
would
be
a
good
excuse
for
having
turned
back
so
unexpectedly
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
wrote
a
note
for
his
portmanteau
,
and
sent
it
by
a
messenger
,
who
duly
brought
his
luggage
back
,
with
a
short
note
from
that
other
piece
of
luggage
,
his
wife
,
expressive
of
her
wish
to
be
allowed
to
come
and
see
him
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
request
he
sent
for
answer
,
"
she
had
better
;
"
and
one
such
threatening
affirmative
being
sufficient
,
in
defiance
of
the
English
grammar
,
to
express
a
negative
,
she
kept
away
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
being
much
engaged
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
Jonas
bestowed
his
spirits
chiefly
on
the
doctor
,
with
whom
he
lunched
in
the
medical
officer
's
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
way
thither
,
encountering
Mr
Nadgett
in
the
outer
room
,
he
bantered
that
stealthy
gentleman
on
always
appearing
anxious
to
avoid
him
,
and
inquired
if
he
were
afraid
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
slyly
answered
,
"
No
,
but
he
believed
it
must
be
his
way
as
he
had
been
charged
with
much
the
same
kind
of
thing
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
was
listening
to
,
or
,
to
speak
with
greater
elegance
,
he
overheard
,
this
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Jonas
was
gone
he
beckoned
Nadgett
to
him
with
the
feather
of
his
pen
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
gave
him
my
letter
this
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
lodger
,
sir
,
"
said
Nadgett
,
behind
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
came
that
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
found
him
on
the
wharf
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Being
so
much
hurried
,
<EOS>
and
you
not
arrived
,
it
was
necessary
to
do
something
.
 
<EOS>
It
fortunately
occurred
to
me
,
that
if
I
gave
it
him
myself
I
could
be
of
no
further
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
blown
upon
immediately
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Nadgett
,
you
are
a
jewel
,
"
said
Montague
,
patting
him
on
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
lodger
's
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pinch
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
Montague
reflected
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
asked
:
   
"
From
the
country
,
do
you
know
?
"
   
"
From
Wiltshire
,
sir
,
he
told
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
parted
without
another
word
.
 
<EOS>
To
see
Mr
Nadgett
's
bow
when
Montague
and
he
next
met
,
and
to
see
Mr
Montague
acknowledge
it
,
anybody
might
have
undertaken
to
swear
that
they
had
never
spoken
to
each
other
confidentially
in
all
their
lives
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
Mr
Jonas
and
the
doctor
made
themselves
very
comfortable
upstairs
,
over
a
bottle
of
the
old
Madeira
and
some
sandwiches
;
for
the
doctor
having
been
already
invited
to
dine
below
at
six
o'clock
,
preferred
a
light
repast
for
lunch
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
advisable
,
he
said
,
in
two
points
of
view
:
 
First
,
as
being
healthy
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
as
being
the
better
preparation
for
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
bound
for
all
our
sakes
to
take
particular
care
of
your
digestion
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
the
doctor
smacking
his
lips
after
a
glass
of
wine
;
"
for
depend
upon
it
,
it
is
worth
preserving
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
in
admirable
condition
,
sir
;
perfect
chronometer
-
work
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
your
spirits
could
not
be
so
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
Your
bosom
's
lord
sits
lightly
on
its
throne
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
as
what's
-
his
-
name
says
in
the
play
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
said
it
in
a
play
which
did
anything
like
common
justice
to
our
profession
,
by
the
bye
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
apothecary
in
that
drama
,
sir
,
which
is
a
low
thing
;
vulgar
,
sir
;
out
of
nature
altogether
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jobling
pulled
out
his
shirt
-
frill
of
fine
linen
,
as
though
he
would
have
said
,
"
This
is
what
I
call
nature
in
a
medical
man
,
sir
;
"
and
looked
at
Jonas
for
an
observation
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
not
being
in
a
condition
to
pursue
the
subject
,
took
up
a
case
of
lancets
that
was
lying
on
the
table
,
and
opened
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
doctor
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
"
I
always
take
'em
out
of
my
pocket
before
I
eat
.
 
<EOS>
My
pockets
are
rather
tight
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
had
opened
one
of
the
shining
little
instruments
;
and
was
scrutinizing
it
with
a
look
as
sharp
and
eager
as
its
own
bright
edge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
steel
,
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
Good
steel
!
 
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
Ye
-
es
,
"
replied
the
doctor
,
with
the
faltering
modesty
of
ownership
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
might
open
a
vein
pretty
dexterously
with
that
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
opened
a
good
many
in
its
time
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Jonas
looking
at
it
with
a
growing
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
few
,
my
dear
sir
,
not
a
few
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
engaged
in
a
---
in
a
pretty
good
practice
,
I
believe
I
may
say
,
"
replied
the
doctor
,
coughing
as
if
the
matter
-
of
-
fact
were
so
very
dry
and
literal
that
he
could
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
pretty
good
practice
,
"
repeated
the
doctor
,
putting
another
glass
of
wine
to
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
could
you
cut
a
man
's
throat
with
such
a
thing
as
this
?
"
demanded
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
certainly
,
certainly
,
if
you
took
him
in
the
right
place
,
"
returned
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
all
depends
upon
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
you
have
your
hand
now
,
hey
?
"
cried
Jonas
,
bending
forward
to
look
at
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
that
's
the
jugular
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
,
in
his
vivacity
,
made
a
sudden
sawing
in
the
air
,
so
close
behind
the
doctor
's
jugular
that
he
turned
quite
red
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Jonas
(
in
the
same
strange
spirit
of
vivacity
)
burst
into
a
loud
discordant
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
edge
tools
,
edge
tools
;
never
play
with
'em
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
remarkable
instance
of
the
skillful
use
of
edge
-
tools
,
by
the
way
,
occurs
to
me
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
case
of
murder
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
it
was
a
case
of
murder
,
committed
by
a
member
of
our
profession
;
it
was
so
artistically
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
was
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
returned
Jobling
,
"
the
thing
lies
in
a
nutshell
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
gentleman
was
found
,
one
morning
,
in
an
obscure
street
,
lying
in
an
angle
of
a
doorway
---
I
should
rather
say
,
leaning
,
in
an
upright
position
,
in
the
angle
of
a
doorway
,
and
supported
consequently
by
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
his
waistcoat
there
was
one
solitary
drop
of
blood
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dead
and
cold
;
and
had
been
murdered
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
one
drop
of
blood
!
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
that
man
,
"
replied
the
doctor
,
"
had
been
stabbed
to
the
heart
.
<EOS>
Had
been
stabbed
to
the
heart
with
such
dexterity
,
sir
,
that
he
had
died
instantly
,
and
had
bled
internally
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
supposed
that
a
medical
friend
of
his
(
to
whom
suspicion
attached
)
had
engaged
him
in
conversation
on
some
pretence
;
had
taken
him
,
very
likely
,
by
the
button
in
a
conversational
manner
;
had
examined
his
ground
at
leisure
with
his
other
hand
;
had
marked
the
exact
spot
;
drawn
out
the
instrument
,
whatever
it
was
,
when
he
was
quite
prepared
;
and
---
"
   
"
And
done
the
trick
,
"
suggested
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
quite
an
operation
in
its
way
,
and
very
neat
.
 
<EOS>
The
medical
friend
never
turned
up
;
and
,
as
I
tell
you
,
he
had
the
credit
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
did
it
or
not
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
having
had
the
honour
to
be
called
in
with
two
or
three
of
my
professional
brethren
on
the
occasion
,
and
having
assisted
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
the
wound
,
I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
it
would
have
reflected
credit
on
any
medical
man
;
and
that
in
an
unprofessional
person
it
could
not
but
be
considered
,
either
as
an
extraordinary
work
of
art
,
or
the
result
of
a
still
more
extraordinary
,
happy
,
and
favourable
conjunction
of
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
His
hearer
was
so
much
interested
in
this
case
,
that
the
doctor
went
on
to
elucidate
it
with
the
assistance
of
his
own
finger
and
thumb
and
waistcoat
;
and
at
Jonas
's
request
,
he
took
the
further
trouble
of
going
into
a
corner
of
the
room
,
and
alternately
representing
the
murdered
man
and
the
murderer
;
which
he
did
with
great
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
bottle
being
emptied
and
the
story
done
,
Jonas
was
in
precisely
the
same
boisterous
and
unusual
state
as
when
they
had
sat
down
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
as
Jobling
theorized
,
his
good
digestion
were
the
cause
,
he
must
have
been
a
very
ostrich
.
   
<EOS>
At
dinner
it
was
just
the
same
;
and
after
dinner
too
;
though
wine
was
drunk
in
abundance
,
and
various
rich
meats
eaten
.
 
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
it
was
still
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
There
being
a
lamp
in
the
carriage
,
he
swore
they
would
take
a
pack
of
cards
,
and
a
bottle
of
wine
;
and
with
these
things
under
his
cloak
,
went
down
to
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Out
of
the
way
,
Tom
Thumb
,
and
get
to
bed
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
salutation
he
bestowed
on
Mr
Bailey
,
who
,
booted
and
wrapped
up
,
stood
at
the
carriage
door
to
help
him
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
bed
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
-
going
,
too
,
"
said
Bailey
.
   
<EOS>
He
alighted
quickly
,
and
walked
back
into
the
hall
,
where
Montague
was
lighting
a
cigar
;
conducting
Mr
Bailey
with
him
,
by
the
collar
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
a
-
going
to
take
this
monkey
of
a
boy
,
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Montague
.
   
<EOS>
He
gave
the
boy
a
shake
,
and
threw
him
roughly
aside
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
more
of
his
familiar
self
in
the
action
,
than
in
anything
he
had
done
that
day
;
but
he
broke
out
laughing
immediately
afterwards
,
and
making
a
thrust
at
the
doctor
with
his
hand
,
in
imitation
of
his
representation
of
the
medical
friend
,
went
out
to
the
carriage
again
,
and
took
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
His
companion
followed
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bailey
climbed
into
the
rumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
stormy
night
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
doctor
,
as
they
started
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Continuation
of
the
enterprise
of
Mr
Jonas
and
his
friend
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
prognostication
in
reference
to
the
weather
was
speedily
verified
.
 
<EOS>
Although
the
weather
was
not
a
patient
of
his
,
and
no
third
party
had
required
him
to
give
an
opinion
on
the
case
,
the
quick
fulfilment
of
his
prophecy
may
be
taken
as
an
instance
of
his
professional
tact
;
for
,
unless
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
night
had
been
perfectly
plain
and
unmistakable
,
Mr
Jobling
would
never
have
compromised
his
reputation
by
delivering
any
sentiments
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
this
principle
in
Medicine
with
too
much
success
to
be
unmindful
of
it
in
his
commonest
transactions
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
hot
,
silent
nights
,
when
people
sit
at
windows
listening
for
the
thunder
which
they
know
will
shortly
break
;
when
they
recall
dismal
tales
of
hurricanes
and
earthquakes
;
and
of
lonely
travellers
on
open
plains
,
and
lonely
ships
at
sea
,
struck
by
lightning
.
 
<EOS>
Lightning
flashed
and
quivered
on
the
black
horizon
even
now
;
and
hollow
murmurings
were
in
the
wind
,
as
though
it
had
been
blowing
where
the
thunder
rolled
,
and
still
was
charged
with
its
exhausted
echoes
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
storm
,
though
gathering
swiftly
,
had
not
yet
come
up
;
and
the
prevailing
stillness
was
the
more
solemn
,
from
the
dull
intelligence
that
seemed
to
hover
in
the
air
,
of
noise
and
conflict
afar
off
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
very
dark
;
but
in
the
murky
sky
there
were
masses
of
cloud
which
shone
with
a
lurid
light
,
like
monstrous
heaps
of
copper
that
had
been
heated
in
a
furnace
,
and
were
growing
cold
.
 
<EOS>
These
had
been
advancing
steadily
and
slowly
,
but
they
were
now
motionless
,
or
nearly
so
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
carriage
clattered
round
the
corners
of
the
streets
,
it
passed
at
every
one
a
knot
of
persons
who
had
come
there
---
<EOS>
many
from
their
houses
close
at
hand
,
without
hats
---
to
look
up
at
that
quarter
of
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
a
very
few
large
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
,
and
thunder
rumbled
in
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
with
his
bottle
resting
on
his
knee
,
and
gripped
as
tightly
in
his
hand
as
if
he
would
have
ground
its
neck
to
powder
if
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
Instinctively
attracted
by
the
night
,
he
had
laid
aside
the
pack
of
cards
upon
the
cushion
;
and
with
the
same
involuntary
impulse
,
so
intelligible
to
both
of
them
as
not
to
occasion
a
remark
on
either
side
,
his
companion
had
extinguished
the
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
The
front
glasses
were
down
;
and
they
sat
looking
silently
out
upon
the
gloomy
scene
before
them
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
clear
of
London
,
or
as
clear
of
it
as
travellers
can
be
whose
way
lies
on
the
Western
Road
,
within
a
stage
of
that
enormous
city
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
they
encountered
a
foot
-
passenger
,
hurrying
to
the
nearest
place
of
shelter
;
or
some
unwieldy
cart
proceeding
onward
at
a
heavy
trot
,
with
the
same
end
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
Little
clusters
of
such
vehicles
were
gathered
round
the
stable
-
yard
or
baiting
-
place
of
every
wayside
tavern
;
while
their
drivers
watched
the
weather
from
the
doors
and
open
windows
,
or
made
merry
within
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
people
were
disposed
to
bear
each
other
company
rather
than
sit
alone
;
so
that
groups
of
watchful
faces
seemed
to
be
looking
out
upon
the
night
AND
THEM
,
from
almost
every
house
they
passed
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
appear
strange
that
this
should
have
disturbed
Jonas
,
or
rendered
him
uneasy
;
but
it
did
.
 
<EOS>
After
muttering
to
himself
,
and
often
changing
his
position
,
he
drew
up
the
blind
on
his
side
of
the
carriage
,
and
turned
his
shoulder
sulkily
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
neither
looked
at
his
companion
,
nor
broke
the
silence
which
prevailed
between
them
,
and
which
had
fallen
so
suddenly
upon
himself
,
by
addressing
a
word
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
thunder
rolled
,
the
lightning
flashed
;
the
rain
poured
down
like
Heaven
's
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
Surrounded
at
one
moment
by
intolerable
light
,
and
at
the
next
by
pitchy
darkness
,
they
still
pressed
forward
on
their
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
they
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
stage
,
and
might
have
tarried
,
they
did
not
;
but
ordered
horses
out
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
had
this
any
reference
to
some
five
minutes
'
lull
,
which
at
that
time
seemed
to
promise
a
cessation
of
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
They
held
their
course
as
if
they
were
impelled
and
driven
by
its
fury
.
 
<EOS>
Although
they
had
not
exchanged
a
dozen
words
,
and
might
have
tarried
very
well
,
they
seemed
to
feel
,
by
joint
consent
,
that
onward
they
must
go
.
   
<EOS>
Louder
and
louder
the
deep
thunder
rolled
,
as
through
the
myriad
halls
of
some
vast
temple
in
the
sky
;
fiercer
and
brighter
became
the
lightning
,
more
and
more
heavily
the
rain
poured
down
.
 
<EOS>
The
horses
(
they
were
travelling
now
with
a
single
pair
)
plunged
and
started
from
the
rills
of
quivering
fire
that
seemed
to
wind
along
the
ground
before
them
;
but
there
these
two
men
sat
,
and
forward
they
went
as
if
they
were
led
on
by
an
invisible
attraction
.
   
<EOS>
The
eye
,
partaking
of
the
quickness
of
the
flashing
light
,
saw
in
its
every
gleam
a
multitude
of
objects
which
it
could
not
see
at
steady
noon
in
fifty
times
that
period
.
 
<EOS>
Bells
in
steeples
,
with
the
rope
and
wheel
that
moved
them
<EOS>
;
ragged
nests
of
birds
in
cornices
and
nooks
;
faces
full
of
consternation
in
the
tilted
waggons
that
came
tearing
past
;
their
frightened
teams
ringing
out
a
warning
which
the
thunder
drowned
;
harrows
and
ploughs
left
out
in
fields
;
miles
upon
miles
of
hedge
-
divided
country
,
with
the
distant
fringe
of
trees
as
obvious
as
the
scarecrow
in
the
bean
-
field
close
at
hand
;
in
a
trembling
,
vivid
,
flickering
instant
,
everything
was
clear
and
plain
;
then
came
a
flush
of
red
into
the
yellow
light
;
a
change
to
blue
;
a
brightness
so
intense
that
there
was
nothing
else
but
light
;
and
then
the
deepest
and
profoundest
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
The
lightning
being
very
crooked
and
very
dazzling
may
have
presented
or
assisted
a
curious
optical
illusion
,
which
suddenly
rose
before
the
startled
eyes
of
Montague
in
the
carriage
,
and
as
rapidly
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
he
saw
Jonas
with
his
hand
lifted
,
and
the
bottle
clenched
in
it
like
a
hammer
,
making
as
if
he
would
aim
a
blow
at
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
observed
(
or
so
believed
)
an
expression
in
his
face
---
a
combination
of
the
unnatural
excitement
he
had
shown
all
day
,
with
a
wild
hatred
and
fear
---
which
might
have
rendered
a
wolf
a
less
terrible
companion
.
   
<EOS>
He
uttered
an
involuntary
exclamation
,
and
called
to
the
driver
,
who
brought
his
horses
to
a
stop
with
all
speed
.
   
<EOS>
It
could
hardly
have
been
as
he
supposed
,
for
although
he
had
not
taken
his
eyes
off
his
companion
,
and
had
not
seen
him
move
,
he
sat
reclining
in
his
corner
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
general
way
of
waking
out
of
your
sleep
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
swear
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
that
I
have
not
closed
my
eyes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
have
sworn
it
,
"
said
Jonas
,
composedly
,
"
we
had
better
go
on
again
,
if
you
have
only
stopped
for
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
uncorked
the
bottle
with
the
help
of
his
teeth
;
and
putting
it
to
his
lips
,
took
a
long
draught
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
had
never
started
on
this
journey
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
,
"
said
Montague
,
recoiling
instinctively
,
and
speaking
in
a
voice
that
betrayed
his
agitation
;
"
this
is
not
a
night
to
travel
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
<EOS>
you
're
right
there
,
"
returned
Jonas
,
"
and
we
should
n't
be
out
in
it
but
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
n't
kept
me
waiting
all
day
,
we
might
have
been
at
Salisbury
by
this
time
;
snug
abed
and
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
What
are
we
stopping
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
companion
put
his
head
out
of
window
for
a
moment
,
and
drawing
it
in
again
,
observed
(
as
if
that
were
his
cause
of
anxiety
)
,
that
the
boy
was
drenched
to
the
skin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Serve
him
right
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
devil
are
we
stopping
for
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
spread
him
out
to
dry
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
half
a
mind
to
take
him
inside
,
"
observed
the
other
with
some
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
thankee
!
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
want
any
damp
boys
here
;
especially
a
young
imp
like
him
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
be
where
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
afraid
of
a
little
thunder
and
lightning
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
whoever
else
is
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
,
driver
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
better
have
HIM
inside
perhaps
,
"
he
muttered
with
a
laugh
;
"
and
the
horses
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
too
fast
,
"
cried
Montague
to
the
postillion
;
"
and
take
care
how
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
nearly
in
the
ditch
when
I
called
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
not
true
;
and
Jonas
bluntly
said
so
,
as
they
moved
forward
again
.
 
<EOS>
Montague
took
little
or
no
heed
of
what
he
said
,
but
repeated
that
it
was
not
a
night
for
travelling
,
and
showed
himself
,
both
then
and
afterwards
,
unusually
anxious
.
   
<EOS>
From
this
time
Jonas
recovered
his
former
spirits
,
if
such
a
term
may
be
employed
to
express
the
state
in
which
he
had
left
the
city
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
bottle
often
at
his
mouth
;
roared
out
snatches
of
songs
,
without
the
least
regard
to
time
or
tune
or
voice
,
or
anything
but
loud
discordance
;
and
urged
his
silent
friend
to
be
merry
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
best
company
in
the
world
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
said
Montague
with
an
effort
,
"
and
in
general
irresistible
;
but
to
-
night
 
---
<EOS>
do
you
hear
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
<EOS>
I
hear
and
see
it
too
,
"
cried
Jonas
,
shading
his
eyes
,
for
the
moment
,
from
the
lightning
which
was
flashing
,
not
in
any
one
direction
,
but
all
around
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
It
do
n't
change
you
,
nor
me
,
nor
our
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
Chorus
,
chorus
,
   
<EOS>
It
may
lighten
and
storm
,
   
<EOS>
Till
it
hunt
the
red
worm
     
<EOS>
From
the
grass
where
the
gibbet
is
driven
;
   
But
it
ca
n't
hurt
the
dead
,
   
<EOS>
And
it
wo
n't
save
the
head
     
<EOS>
That
is
doom'd
to
be
rifled
and
riven
.
   
<EOS>
That
must
be
a
precious
old
song
,
"
he
added
with
an
oath
,
as
he
stopped
short
in
a
kind
of
wonder
at
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
heard
it
since
I
was
a
boy
,
and
how
it
comes
into
my
head
now
,
unless
the
lightning
put
it
there
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
hurt
the
dead
"
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
wo
n't
save
the
head
"
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
mirth
was
of
such
a
savage
and
extraordinary
character
,
and
was
,
in
an
inexplicable
way
,
at
once
so
suited
to
the
night
,
and
yet
such
a
coarse
intrusion
on
its
terrors
,
that
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
always
a
coward
,
shrunk
from
him
in
positive
fear
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
Jonas
being
his
tool
and
instrument
,
their
places
seemed
to
be
reversed
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
reason
for
this
too
,
Montague
thought
;
since
the
sense
of
his
debasement
might
naturally
inspire
such
a
man
with
the
wish
to
assert
a
noisy
independence
,
and
in
that
licence
to
forget
his
real
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Being
quick
enough
,
in
reference
to
such
subjects
of
contemplation
,
he
was
not
long
in
taking
this
argument
into
account
and
giving
it
its
full
weight
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
,
he
felt
a
vague
sense
of
alarm
,
and
was
depressed
and
uneasy
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
certain
he
had
not
been
asleep
;
but
his
eyes
might
have
deceived
him
;
for
,
looking
at
Jonas
now
in
any
interval
of
darkness
,
he
could
represent
his
figure
to
himself
in
any
attitude
his
state
of
mind
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
he
knew
full
well
that
Jonas
had
no
reason
to
love
him
;
and
even
taking
the
piece
of
pantomime
which
had
so
impressed
his
mind
to
be
a
real
gesture
,
and
not
the
working
of
his
fancy
,
the
most
that
could
be
said
of
it
was
,
that
it
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
his
diabolical
fun
,
and
had
the
same
impotent
expression
of
truth
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
could
kill
me
with
a
wish
,
"
thought
the
swindler
,
"
I
should
not
live
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
resolved
that
when
he
should
have
had
his
use
of
Jonas
,
he
would
restrain
him
with
an
iron
curb
;
in
the
meantime
,
that
he
could
not
do
better
than
leave
him
to
take
his
own
way
,
and
preserve
his
own
peculiar
description
of
good
-
humour
,
after
his
own
uncommon
manner
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
great
sacrifice
to
bear
with
him
;
"
for
when
all
is
got
that
can
be
got
,
"
thought
Montague
,
"
I
shall
decamp
across
the
water
,
and
have
the
laugh
on
my
side
---
and
the
gains
.
"
   
<EOS>
Such
were
his
reflections
from
hour
to
hour
;
his
state
of
mind
being
one
in
which
the
same
thoughts
constantly
present
themselves
over
and
over
again
in
wearisome
repetition
;
while
Jonas
,
who
appeared
to
have
dismissed
reflection
altogether
,
entertained
himself
as
before
.
<EOS>
They
agreed
that
they
would
go
to
Salisbury
,
and
would
cross
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
in
the
morning
;
and
at
the
prospect
of
deluding
that
worthy
gentleman
,
the
spirits
of
his
amiable
son
-
in
-
law
became
more
boisterous
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
night
wore
on
,
the
thunder
died
away
,
but
still
rolled
gloomily
and
mournfully
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
The
lightning
too
,
though
now
comparatively
harmless
,
was
yet
bright
and
frequent
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
was
quite
as
violent
as
it
had
ever
been
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
their
ill
-
fortune
,
at
about
the
time
of
dawn
and
in
the
last
stage
of
their
journey
,
to
have
a
restive
pair
of
horses
.
 
<EOS>
These
animals
had
been
greatly
terrified
in
their
stable
by
the
tempest
;
and
coming
out
into
the
dreary
interval
between
night
and
morning
,
when
the
glare
of
the
lightning
was
yet
unsubdued
by
day
,
and
the
various
objects
in
their
view
were
presented
in
indistinct
and
exaggerated
shapes
which
they
would
not
have
worn
by
night
,
they
gradually
became
less
and
less
capable
of
control
;
until
,
taking
a
sudden
fright
at
something
by
the
roadside
,
they
dashed
off
wildly
down
a
steep
hill
,
flung
the
driver
from
his
saddle
,
drew
the
carriage
to
the
brink
of
a
ditch
,
stumbled
headlong
down
,
and
threw
it
crashing
over
.
   
<EOS>
The
travellers
had
opened
the
carriage
door
,
and
had
either
jumped
or
fallen
out
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
was
the
first
to
stagger
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
sick
and
weak
,
and
very
giddy
,
and
reeling
to
a
five
-
barred
gate
,
stood
holding
by
it
;
looking
drowsily
about
as
the
whole
landscape
swam
before
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
by
degrees
,
he
grew
more
conscious
,
and
presently
observed
that
Montague
was
lying
senseless
in
the
road
,
within
a
few
feet
of
the
horses
.
   
<EOS>
In
an
instant
,
as
if
his
own
faint
body
were
suddenly
animated
by
a
demon
,
he
ran
to
the
horses
'
heads
;
and
pulling
at
their
bridles
with
all
his
force
,
set
them
struggling
and
plunging
with
such
mad
violence
as
brought
their
hoofs
at
every
effort
nearer
to
the
skull
of
the
prostrate
man
;
and
must
have
led
in
half
a
minute
to
his
brains
being
dashed
out
on
the
highway
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
did
this
,
he
fought
and
contended
with
them
like
a
man
possessed
,
making
them
wilder
by
his
cries
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whoop
!
"
cried
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whoop
!
<EOS>
again
!
<EOS>
another
!
 
<EOS>
A
little
more
,
a
little
more
!
 
<EOS>
Up
,
ye
devils
!
 
<EOS>
Hillo
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
heard
the
driver
,
who
had
risen
and
was
hurrying
up
,
crying
to
him
to
desist
,
his
violence
increased
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hiilo
!
 
Hillo
!
"
cried
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
!
"
cried
the
driver
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
---
in
the
road
---
 
he
'll
be
killed
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
same
shouts
and
the
same
struggles
were
his
only
answer
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
man
darting
in
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
,
saved
Montague
's
,
by
dragging
him
through
the
mire
and
water
out
of
the
reach
of
present
harm
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
ran
to
Jonas
;
and
with
the
aid
of
his
knife
they
very
shortly
disengaged
the
horses
from
the
broken
chariot
,
and
got
them
,
cut
and
bleeding
,
on
their
legs
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
postillion
and
Jonas
had
now
leisure
to
look
at
each
other
,
which
they
had
not
had
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Presence
of
mind
,
presence
of
mind
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
throwing
up
his
hands
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
done
without
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
other
gentleman
would
have
done
badly
without
ME
,
"
returned
the
man
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
moved
him
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
up
for
dead
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Presence
of
mind
,
you
croaker
,
presence
of
mind
"
cried
Jonas
with
a
harsh
loud
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
he
struck
,
do
you
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
both
turned
to
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
muttered
something
to
himself
,
when
he
saw
him
sitting
up
beneath
the
hedge
,
looking
vacantly
around
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
asked
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
anybody
hurt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
<EOS>
"
said
Jonas
,
"
it
do
n't
seem
so
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
no
bones
broken
,
after
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
raised
him
,
and
he
tried
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
deal
shaken
,
and
trembled
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
the
exception
of
a
few
cuts
and
bruises
this
was
all
the
damage
he
had
sustained
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cuts
and
bruises
,
eh
?
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
've
all
got
them
.
 
<EOS>
Only
cuts
and
bruises
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
have
given
sixpence
for
the
gentleman
's
head
in
half
-
a
-
dozen
seconds
more
,
for
all
he
's
only
cut
and
bruised
,
"
observed
the
post
-
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
ever
you
're
in
an
accident
of
this
sort
again
,
sir
;
which
I
hope
you
wo
n't
be
;
never
you
pull
at
the
bridle
of
a
horse
that
's
down
,
when
there
's
a
man
's
head
in
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
That
ca
n't
be
done
twice
without
there
being
a
dead
man
in
the
case
;
it
would
have
ended
in
that
,
this
time
,
as
sure
as
ever
you
were
born
,
if
I
had
n't
come
up
just
when
I
did
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
replied
by
advising
him
with
a
curse
to
hold
his
tongue
,
and
to
go
somewhere
<EOS>
,
whither
he
was
not
very
likely
to
go
of
his
own
accord
.
 
<EOS>
But
Montague
,
who
had
listened
eagerly
to
every
word
,
himself
diverted
the
subject
,
by
exclaiming
:
"
Where
's
the
boy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
<EOS>
I
forgot
that
monkey
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
become
of
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
A
very
brief
search
settled
that
question
.
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Mr
Bailey
had
been
thrown
sheer
over
the
hedge
or
the
five
-
barred
gate
;
and
was
lying
in
the
neighbouring
field
,
to
all
appearance
dead
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
said
to
-
night
,
that
I
wished
I
had
never
started
on
this
journey
,
"
cried
his
master
,
"
I
knew
it
was
an
ill
-
fated
one
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
this
boy
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
growled
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
call
THAT
a
sign
of
it
---
"
   
"
Why
,
what
should
I
call
a
sign
of
it
?
"
asked
Montague
,
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
said
Jonas
,
stooping
down
over
the
body
,
"
that
I
never
heard
you
were
his
father
,
or
had
any
particular
reason
to
care
much
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
Halloa
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
up
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
the
boy
was
past
holding
up
,
or
being
held
up
,
or
giving
any
other
sign
of
life
than
a
faint
and
fitful
beating
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
After
some
discussion
the
driver
mounted
the
horse
which
had
been
least
injured
,
and
took
the
lad
in
his
arms
as
well
as
he
could
;
while
Montague
and
Jonas
,
leading
the
other
horse
,
and
carrying
a
trunk
between
them
,
walked
by
his
side
towards
Salisbury
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
get
there
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
be
able
to
send
assistance
to
meet
us
,
if
you
went
forward
,
post
-
boy
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Trot
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
cried
Montague
;
"
we
'll
keep
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
a
chicken
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
afraid
of
being
robbed
;
are
you
?
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afraid
of
anything
,
"
replied
the
other
,
whose
looks
and
manner
were
in
flat
contradiction
to
his
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
we
'll
keep
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
mighty
anxious
about
the
boy
,
a
minute
ago
,
"
said
Jonas
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
that
he
may
die
in
the
meantime
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
'll
keep
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
it
was
clear
that
he
was
not
to
be
moved
from
this
determination
,
Jonas
made
no
other
rejoinder
than
such
as
his
face
expressed
;
and
they
proceeded
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
three
or
four
good
miles
to
travel
;
and
the
way
was
not
made
easier
by
the
state
of
the
road
,
the
burden
by
which
they
were
embarrassed
,
or
their
own
stiff
and
sore
condition
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
sufficiently
long
and
painful
walk
,
they
arrived
at
the
Inn
;
and
having
knocked
the
people
up
(
it
being
yet
very
early
in
the
morning
)
,
sent
out
messengers
to
see
to
the
carriage
and
its
contents
,
and
roused
a
surgeon
from
his
bed
to
tend
the
chief
sufferer
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
service
he
could
render
,
he
rendered
promptly
and
skilfully
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
boy
was
labouring
under
a
severe
concussion
of
the
brain
,
and
that
Mr
Bailey
's
mortal
course
was
run
.
   
<EOS>
If
Montague
's
strong
interest
in
the
announcement
could
have
been
considered
as
unselfish
in
any
degree
,
it
might
have
been
a
redeeming
trait
in
a
character
that
had
no
such
lineaments
to
spare
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
,
for
some
unexpressed
reason
best
appreciated
by
himself
,
he
attached
a
strange
value
to
the
company
and
presence
of
this
mere
child
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
after
receiving
some
assistance
from
the
surgeon
himself
,
he
retired
to
the
bedroom
prepared
for
him
,
and
it
was
broad
day
,
his
mind
was
still
dwelling
on
this
theme
,
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
have
lost
,
"
he
said
,
"
a
thousand
pounds
than
lost
the
boy
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
return
home
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
upon
that
.
 
<EOS>
Chuzzlewit
shall
go
forward
first
,
and
I
will
follow
in
my
own
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
have
no
more
of
this
,
"
he
added
,
wiping
his
damp
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
"
Twenty
-
four
hours
of
this
would
turn
my
hair
grey
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
examining
his
chamber
,
and
looking
under
the
bed
,
and
in
the
cupboards
,
and
even
behind
the
curtains
,
with
unusual
caution
(
although
it
was
,
as
has
been
said
,
broad
day
)
,
he
double
-
locked
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
,
and
retired
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
door
in
the
room
,
but
it
was
locked
on
the
outer
side
;
and
with
what
place
it
communicated
,
he
knew
not
.
   
<EOS>
His
fears
or
evil
conscience
reproduced
this
door
in
all
his
dreams
.
<EOS>
He
dreamed
that
a
dreadful
secret
was
connected
with
it
;
a
secret
which
he
knew
,
and
yet
did
not
know
,
for
although
he
was
heavily
responsible
for
it
,
and
a
party
to
it
,
he
was
harassed
even
in
his
vision
by
a
distracting
uncertainty
in
reference
to
its
import
.
<EOS>
Incoherently
entwined
with
this
dream
was
another
,
which
represented
it
as
the
hiding
-
place
of
an
enemy
,
a
shadow
,
a
phantom
;
and
made
it
the
business
of
his
life
to
keep
the
terrible
creature
closed
up
,
and
prevent
it
from
forcing
its
way
in
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
Nadgett
,
and
he
,
and
a
strange
man
with
a
bloody
smear
upon
his
head
(
who
told
him
that
he
had
been
his
playfellow
,
and
told
him
,
too
,
the
real
name
of
an
old
schoolmate
,
forgotten
until
then
)
,
worked
with
iron
plates
and
nails
to
make
the
door
secure
;
<EOS>
but
though
they
worked
never
so
hard
,
it
was
all
in
vain
,
for
the
nails
broke
,
or
changed
to
soft
twigs
,
or
what
was
worse
,
to
worms
,
between
their
fingers
;
the
wood
of
the
door
splintered
and
crumbled
,
so
that
even
nails
would
not
remain
in
it
;
and
the
iron
plates
curled
up
like
hot
paper
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
creature
on
the
other
side
---
whether
it
was
in
the
shape
of
man
,
or
beast
<EOS>
,
he
neither
knew
nor
sought
to
know
---
 
was
gaining
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
greatest
terror
was
when
the
man
with
the
bloody
smear
upon
his
head
demanded
of
him
if
he
knew
this
creatures
name
,
and
said
that
he
would
whisper
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
the
dreamer
fell
upon
his
knees
,
his
whole
blood
thrilling
with
inexplicable
fear
,
and
held
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
But
looking
at
the
speaker
's
lips
,
he
saw
that
they
formed
the
utterance
of
the
letter
"
J
"
;
and
crying
out
aloud
that
the
secret
was
discovered
,
and
they
were
all
lost
,
he
awoke
.
   
<EOS>
Awoke
to
find
Jonas
standing
at
his
bedside
watching
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
very
door
wide
open
.
   
<EOS>
As
their
eyes
met
,
Jonas
retreated
a
few
paces
,
and
Montague
sprang
out
of
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heyday
!
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
all
alive
this
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Alive
!
"
<EOS>
the
other
stammered
,
as
he
pulled
the
bell
-
rope
violently
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
your
room
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Jonas
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
almost
inclined
to
ask
you
what
YOU
are
doing
here
?
 
<EOS>
My
room
is
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
told
me
last
night
not
to
open
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
led
into
a
passage
,
and
was
coming
out
to
order
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
 
<EOS>
---
there
's
no
bell
in
my
room
.
"
   
<EOS>
Montague
had
in
the
meantime
admitted
the
man
with
his
hot
water
and
boots
,
who
hearing
this
,
said
,
yes
,
there
was
;
and
passed
into
the
adjoining
room
to
point
it
out
,
at
the
head
of
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
find
it
,
then
,
"
said
Jonas
;
"
it
's
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
order
breakfast
?
"
   
<EOS>
Montague
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
When
Jonas
had
retired
,
whistling
,
through
his
own
room
,
he
opened
the
door
of
communication
,
to
take
out
the
key
and
fasten
it
on
the
inner
side
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
taken
out
already
.
   
<EOS>
He
dragged
a
table
against
the
door
,
and
sat
down
to
collect
himself
,
as
if
his
dreams
still
had
some
influence
upon
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
An
evil
journey
,
"
he
repeated
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
evil
journey
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
travel
home
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
have
no
more
of
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
presentiment
,
or
superstition
,
that
it
was
an
evil
journey
,
did
not
at
all
deter
him
from
doing
the
evil
for
which
the
journey
was
undertaken
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
in
view
,
he
dressed
himself
more
carefully
than
usual
to
make
a
favourable
impression
on
Mr
Pecksniff
;
and
,
reassured
by
his
own
appearance
,
the
beauty
of
the
morning
,
and
the
flashing
of
the
wet
boughs
outside
his
window
in
the
merry
sunshine
,
was
soon
sufficiently
inspirited
to
swear
a
few
round
oaths
,
and
hum
the
fag
-
end
of
a
song
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
still
muttered
to
himself
at
intervals
,
for
all
that
:
"
I
'll
travel
home
alone
!

Chapter
43
.
<EOS>
Has
an
influence
on
the
fortunes
of
several
people
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
is
exhibited
in
the
plenitude
of
power
;
and
wields
the
same
with
fortitude
and
magnanimity
 
On
the
night
of
the
storm
,
Mrs
Lupin
,
hostess
of
the
Blue
Dragon
,
sat
by
herself
in
her
little
bar
.
 
<EOS>
Her
solitary
condition
,
or
the
bad
weather
,
or
both
united
,
made
Mrs
Lupin
thoughtful
,
not
to
say
sorrowful
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
sat
with
her
chin
upon
her
hand
,
looking
out
through
a
low
back
lattice
,
rendered
dim
in
the
brightest
day
-
time
by
clustering
vine
-
leaves
,
she
shook
her
head
very
often
,
and
said
,
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
,
dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
melancholy
time
,
even
in
the
snugness
of
the
Dragon
bar
.
<EOS>
The
rich
expanse
of
corn
-
field
,
pasture
-
land
,
green
slope
,
and
gentle
undulation
,
with
its
sparkling
brooks
,
its
many
hedgerows
,
and
its
clumps
of
beautiful
trees
,
was
black
and
dreary
,
from
the
diamond
panes
of
the
lattice
away
to
the
far
horizon
,
where
the
thunder
seemed
to
roll
along
the
hills
.
 
<EOS>
The
heavy
rain
beat
down
the
tender
branches
of
vine
and
jessamine
,
and
trampled
on
them
in
its
fury
;
and
when
the
lightning
gleamed
it
showed
the
tearful
leaves
shivering
and
cowering
together
at
the
window
,
and
tapping
at
it
urgently
,
as
if
beseeching
to
be
sheltered
from
the
dismal
night
.
   
<EOS>
As
a
mark
of
her
respect
for
the
lightning
,
Mrs
Lupin
had
removed
her
candle
to
the
chimney
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
Her
basket
of
needle
-
work
stood
unheeded
at
her
elbow
;
her
supper
,
spread
on
a
round
table
not
far
off
,
was
untasted
;
and
the
knives
had
been
removed
for
fear
of
attraction
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
sat
for
a
long
time
with
her
chin
upon
her
hand
,
saying
to
herself
at
intervals
,
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
dear
,
dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
on
the
eve
of
saying
so
,
once
more
,
when
the
latch
of
the
house
-
door
(
closed
to
keep
the
rain
out
)
,
rattled
on
its
well
-
worn
catch
,
and
a
traveller
came
in
,
who
,
shutting
it
after
him
,
and
walking
straight
up
to
the
half
-
door
of
the
bar
,
said
,
rather
gruffly
:
   
<EOS>
"
A
pint
of
the
best
old
beer
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
some
reason
to
be
gruff
,
for
if
he
had
passed
the
day
in
a
waterfall
,
he
could
scarcely
have
been
wetter
than
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
wrapped
up
to
the
eyes
in
a
rough
blue
sailor
's
coat
,
and
had
an
oil
-
skin
hat
on
,
from
the
capacious
brim
of
which
the
rain
fell
trickling
down
upon
his
breast
,
and
back
,
and
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
Judging
from
a
certain
liveliness
of
chin
---
he
had
so
pulled
down
his
hat
,
and
pulled
up
his
collar
,
to
defend
himself
from
the
weather
,
that
she
could
only
see
his
chin
,
and
even
across
that
he
drew
the
wet
sleeve
of
his
shaggy
coat
,
as
she
looked
at
him
---
Mrs
Lupin
set
him
down
for
a
good
-
natured
fellow
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
bad
night
!
"
observed
the
hostess
cheerfully
.
   
<EOS>
The
traveller
shook
himself
like
a
Newfoundland
dog
,
and
said
it
was
,
rather
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
,
"
said
Mrs
Lupin
,
"
and
very
good
company
there
.
 
<EOS>
Had
n't
you
better
go
and
dry
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thankee
,
"
said
the
man
,
glancing
towards
the
kitchen
as
he
spoke
;
he
seemed
to
know
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
enough
to
give
you
your
death
of
cold
,
"
observed
the
hostess
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
take
my
death
easy
,
"
returned
the
traveller
;
"
or
I
should
most
likely
have
took
it
afore
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Your
health
,
ma'am
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
thanked
him
;
but
in
the
act
of
lifting
the
tankard
to
his
mouth
,
he
changed
his
mind
,
and
put
it
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
Throwing
his
body
back
,
and
looking
about
him
stiffly
,
as
a
man
does
who
is
wrapped
up
,
and
has
his
hat
low
down
over
his
eyes
,
he
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
this
house
?
 
<EOS>
Not
the
Dragon
,
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
complacently
made
answer
,
"
Yes
,
the
Dragon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
you
've
got
a
sort
of
a
relation
of
mine
here
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
traveller
;
"
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
Mark
,
my
boy
!
"
<EOS>
apostrophizing
the
premises
,
"
have
I
come
upon
you
at
last
,
old
buck
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
touching
Mrs
Lupin
on
a
tender
point
.
 
<EOS>
She
turned
to
trim
the
candle
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
said
,
with
her
back
towards
the
traveller
:
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
should
be
made
more
welcome
at
the
Dragon
,
master
,
than
any
one
who
brought
me
news
of
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
many
and
many
a
long
day
and
month
since
he
left
here
and
England
.
 
<EOS>
And
whether
he
's
alive
or
dead
,
poor
fellow
,
Heaven
above
us
only
knows
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
and
her
voice
trembled
;
her
hand
must
have
done
so
too
,
for
the
light
required
a
deal
of
trimming
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
did
he
go
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
traveller
,
in
a
gentler
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
went
,
"
said
Mrs
Lupin
,
with
increased
distress
,
"
to
America
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
tender
-
hearted
and
kind
,
and
perhaps
at
this
moment
may
be
lying
in
prison
under
sentence
of
death
,
for
taking
pity
on
some
miserable
black
,
and
helping
the
poor
runaway
creetur
to
escape
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
ever
go
to
America
!
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
he
go
to
some
of
those
countries
where
the
savages
eat
each
other
fairly
,
and
give
an
equal
chance
to
every
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
Quite
subdued
by
this
time
,
Mrs
Lupin
sobbed
,
and
was
retiring
to
a
chair
to
give
her
grief
free
vent
,
when
the
traveller
caught
her
in
his
arms
,
and
she
uttered
a
glad
cry
of
recognition
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
,
"
another
---
one
more
---
twenty
more
!
 
<EOS>
You
did
n't
know
me
in
that
hat
and
coat
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
would
have
known
me
anywheres
!
 
<EOS>
Ten
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
should
have
known
you
,
if
I
could
have
seen
you
;
but
I
could
n't
,
and
you
spoke
so
gruff
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
think
you
could
speak
gruff
to
me
,
Mark
,
at
first
coming
back
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fifteen
more
!
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
handsome
and
how
young
you
look
!
 
<EOS>
Six
more
!
 
<EOS>
The
last
half
-
dozen
warn't
a
fair
one
,
and
must
be
done
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
what
a
treat
<EOS>
it
is
to
see
you
!
 
<EOS>
One
more
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
never
was
so
jolly
.
 
<EOS>
Just
a
few
more
,
on
account
of
there
not
being
any
credit
in
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
Tapley
stopped
in
these
calculations
in
simple
addition
,
he
did
it
,
not
because
he
was
at
all
tired
of
the
exercise
,
but
because
he
was
out
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
The
pause
reminded
him
of
other
duties
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Martin
Chuzzlewit
's
outside
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
left
him
under
the
cartshed
,
while
I
came
on
to
see
if
there
was
anybody
here
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
to
keep
quiet
to
-
night
,
till
we
know
the
news
from
you
,
and
what
it
's
best
for
us
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
not
a
soul
in
the
house
,
except
the
kitchen
company
,
"
returned
the
hostess
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
they
were
to
know
you
had
come
back
,
Mark
,
they
'd
have
a
bonfire
in
the
street
,
late
as
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
they
must
n't
know
it
to
-
night
,
my
precious
soul
,
"
said
Mark
;
"
so
have
the
house
shut
,
and
the
kitchen
fire
made
up
;
and
when
it
's
all
ready
,
put
a
light
in
the
winder
,
and
we
'll
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
One
more
!
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
about
old
friends
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
tell
me
all
about
'em
,
wo
n't
you
;
Mr
Pinch
,
and
the
butcher
's
dog
down
the
street
,
and
the
terrier
over
the
way
,
and
the
wheelwright
's
,
and
every
one
of
'em
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
caught
sight
of
the
church
to
-
night
,
I
thought
the
steeple
would
have
choked
me
,
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
One
more
!
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Not
a
very
little
one
to
finish
off
with
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
plenty
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
the
hostess
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
along
with
your
foreign
manners
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
ai
n't
foreign
,
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Native
as
oysters
,
that
is
!
 
<EOS>
One
more
,
because
it
's
native
!
 
<EOS>
As
a
mark
of
respect
for
the
land
we
live
in
!
 
<EOS>
This
do
n't
count
as
between
you
and
me
,
you
understand
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
a
-
kissing
you
now
,
you
'll
observe
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
among
the
patriots
;
I
'm
a
-
kissin
'
my
country

"
   
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
very
unreasonable
to
complain
of
the
exhibition
of
his
patriotism
with
which
he
followed
up
this
explanation
,
that
it
was
at
all
lukewarm
or
indifferent
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
given
full
expression
to
his
nationality
,
he
hurried
off
to
Martin
;
while
Mrs
Lupin
,
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
and
excitement
,
prepared
for
their
reception
.
   
<EOS>
The
company
soon
came
tumbling
out
;
insisting
to
each
other
that
the
Dragon
clock
was
half
an
hour
too
fast
,
and
that
the
thunder
must
have
affected
it
.
 
<EOS>
Impatient
,
wet
,
and
weary
though
they
were
,
Martin
and
Mark
were
overjoyed
to
see
these
old
faces
,
and
watched
them
with
delighted
interest
as
they
departed
from
the
house
,
and
passed
close
by
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
old
tailor
,
Mark
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
he
goes
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
A
little
bandier
than
he
was
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
sir
,
ai
n't
he
?
 
<EOS>
His
figure
's
so
far
altered
,
as
it
seems
to
me
,
that
you
might
wheel
a
rather
larger
barrow
between
his
legs
as
he
walks
,
than
you
could
have
done
conveniently
when
we
know'd
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
Sam
a
-
coming
out
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
;
"
Sam
,
the
hostler
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
that
horse
of
Pecksniff
's
is
alive
still
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
doubt
on
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
description
of
animal
,
<EOS>
sir
,
as
will
go
on
in
a
bony
way
peculiar
to
himself
for
a
long
time
,
and
get
into
the
newspapers
at
last
under
the
title
of
"
Sing'lar
Tenacity
of
Life
in
a
Quadruped
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
if
he
had
ever
been
alive
in
all
his
life
,
worth
mentioning

<EOS>
There
's
the
clerk
,
sir

<EOS>
wery
drunk
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
him

<EOS>
said
Martin
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
life

how
wet
you
are

Mark
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am

<EOS>
What
do
you
consider
yourself
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
half
as
bad
,
"
said
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
with
an
air
of
great
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
not
to
keep
on
the
windy
side
,
Mark
,
but
to
let
us
change
and
change
about
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
has
been
beating
on
you
ever
since
it
began
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
how
it
pleases
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
after
a
short
silence
,
"
if
I
may
make
so
bold
as
say
so
,
to
hear
you
a
-
going
on
in
that
there
uncommon
considerate
way
of
yours
;
which
I
do
n't
mean
to
attend
to
,
never
,
but
which
,
ever
since
that
time
when
I
was
floored
in
Eden
,
you
have
showed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mark
!
"
sighed
Martin
,
"
the
less
we
say
of
that
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Do
I
see
the
light
yonder
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
light
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
her
,
what
briskness
she
possesses
!
 
<EOS>
Now
for
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Neat
wines
,
good
beds
,
and
first
-
rate
entertainment
for
man
or
beast
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
kitchen
fire
burnt
clear
and
red
,
the
table
was
spread
out
,
the
kettle
boiled
;
the
slippers
were
there
,
the
boot
-
jack
too
,
sheets
of
ham
were
there
,
cooking
on
the
gridiron
;
half
-
a
-
dozen
eggs
were
there
,
poaching
in
the
frying
-
pan
;
a
plethoric
cherry
-
brandy
bottle
was
there
,
winking
at
a
foaming
jug
of
beer
upon
the
table
;
rare
provisions
were
there
,
dangling
from
the
rafters
as
if
you
had
only
to
open
your
mouth
,
and
something
exquisitely
ripe
and
good
would
be
glad
of
the
excuse
for
tumbling
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
,
who
for
their
sakes
had
dislodged
the
very
cook
,
high
priestess
of
the
temple
,
with
her
own
genial
hands
was
dressing
their
repast
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
help
it
---
a
ghost
must
have
hugged
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
Atlantic
Ocean
and
the
Red
Sea
being
,
in
that
respect
,
all
one
,
Martin
hugged
her
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
(
as
if
the
idea
were
quite
novel
,
and
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
)
,
followed
,
with
much
gravity
,
on
the
same
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Little
did
I
ever
think
,
"
said
Mrs
Lupin
,
adjusting
her
cap
and
laughing
heartily
;
yes
,
and
blushing
too
;
"
often
as
I
have
said
that
Mr
Pecksniff
's
young
gentlemen
were
the
life
and
soul
of
the
Dragon
,
and
that
without
them
it
would
be
too
dull
to
live
in
---
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
did
I
ever
think
I
am
sure
,
that
any
one
of
them
would
ever
make
so
free
as
you
,
Mr
Martin
!
 
<EOS>
And
still
less
that
I
should
n't
be
angry
with
him
,
but
should
be
glad
with
all
my
heart
to
be
the
first
to
welcome
him
home
from
America
,
with
Mark
Tapley
for
his
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
For
his
friend
,
Mrs
Lupin
,
"
interposed
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
his
friend
,
"
said
the
hostess
,
evidently
gratified
by
this
distinction
,
but
at
the
same
time
admonishing
Mr
Tapley
with
a
fork
to
remain
at
a
respectful
distance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Little
did
I
ever
think
that
!
<EOS>
But
still
less
,
that
I
should
ever
have
the
changes
to
relate
that
I
shall
have
to
tell
you
of
,
when
you
have
done
your
supper
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
changing
colour
,
"
what
changes
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
SHE
,
"
said
the
hostess
,
"
is
quite
well
,
and
now
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
at
all
alarmed
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
everything
you
could
wish
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
use
mincing
matters
,
or
making
secrets
,
is
it
?
"
added
Mrs
Lupin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
about
it
,
you
see
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
creature
,
"
returned
Martin
,
"
you
are
exactly
the
person
who
ought
to
know
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
delighted
to
think
you
DO
know
about
that
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
changes
do
you
hint
at
?
 
<EOS>
Has
any
death
occurred
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
said
the
hostess
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
as
bad
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
declare
now
that
I
will
not
be
drawn
into
saying
another
word
till
you
have
had
your
supper
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
ask
me
fifty
questions
in
the
meantime
,
I
wo
n't
answer
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
so
positive
,
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
the
supper
over
as
quickly
as
possible
;
and
as
they
had
been
walking
a
great
many
miles
,
and
had
fasted
since
the
middle
of
the
day
,
they
did
no
great
violence
to
their
own
inclinations
in
falling
on
it
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
It
took
rather
longer
to
get
through
than
might
have
been
expected
;
for
,
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
,
when
they
thought
they
had
finished
,
Mrs
Lupin
exposed
the
fallacy
of
that
impression
triumphantly
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
last
,
in
the
course
of
time
and
nature
,
they
gave
in
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
sitting
with
their
slippered
feet
stretched
out
upon
the
kitchen
hearth
(
which
was
wonderfully
comforting
,
for
the
night
had
grown
by
this
time
raw
and
chilly
)
,
and
looking
with
involuntary
admiration
at
their
dimpled
,
buxom
,
blooming
hostess
,
as
the
firelight
sparkled
in
her
eyes
and
glimmered
in
her
raven
hair
,
they
composed
themselves
to
listen
to
her
news
.
   
<EOS>
Many
were
the
exclamations
of
surprise
which
interrupted
her
,
when
she
told
them
of
the
separation
between
Mr
Pecksniff
and
his
daughters
,
and
between
the
same
good
gentleman
and
Mr
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
were
nothing
to
the
indignant
demonstrations
of
Martin
,
when
she
related
,
as
the
common
talk
of
the
neighbourhood
,
what
entire
possession
he
had
obtained
over
the
mind
and
person
of
old
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
and
what
high
honour
he
designed
for
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
On
receipt
of
this
intelligence
,
Martin
's
slippers
flew
off
in
a
twinkling
,
and
he
began
pulling
on
his
wet
boots
with
that
indefinite
intention
of
going
somewhere
instantly
,
and
doing
something
to
somebody
,
which
is
the
first
safety
-
valve
of
a
hot
temper
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
!
"
said
Martin
,
"
smooth
-
tongued
villain
that
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
He
!
 
<EOS>
Give
me
that
other
boot
,
Mark
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
was
you
a
-
thinking
of
going
to
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Tapley
drying
the
sole
at
the
fire
,
and
looking
coolly
at
it
as
he
spoke
,
as
if
it
were
a
slice
of
toast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
!
"
repeated
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
suppose
I
am
going
to
remain
here
,
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
imperturbable
Mark
confessed
that
he
did
.
   
<EOS>
You
do
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Martin
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
take
me
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
you
for
what
you
are
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
;
"
and
,
consequently
,
am
quite
sure
that
whatever
you
do
will
be
right
and
sensible
.
 
<EOS>
The
boot
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
darted
an
impatient
look
at
him
,
without
taking
it
,
and
walked
rapidly
up
and
down
the
kitchen
several
times
,
with
one
boot
and
a
stocking
on
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
mindful
of
his
Eden
resolution
,
he
had
already
gained
many
victories
over
himself
when
Mark
was
in
the
case
,
and
he
resolved
to
conquer
now
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
came
back
to
the
book
-
jack
,
laid
his
hand
on
Mark
's
shoulder
to
steady
himself
,
pulled
the
boot
off
,
picked
up
his
slippers
,
put
them
on
,
and
sat
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
thrusting
his
hands
to
the
very
bottom
of
his
pockets
,
and
muttering
at
intervals
,
"
Pecksniff
too
!
 
<EOS>
That
fellow
!
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
In
-
deed
!
 
<EOS>
What
next
?
"
<EOS>
and
so
forth
;
nor
could
he
help
occasionally
shaking
his
fist
at
the
chimney
,
with
a
very
threatening
countenance
;
but
this
did
not
last
long
;
and
he
heard
Mrs
Lupin
out
,
if
not
with
composure
,
at
all
events
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Pecksniff
himself
,
"
observed
the
hostess
in
conclusion
,
spreading
out
the
skirts
of
her
gown
with
both
hands
,
and
nodding
her
head
a
great
many
times
as
she
did
so
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
must
have
poisoned
his
mind
,
or
influenced
him
in
some
extraordinary
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
that
such
a
noble
-
spoken
gentleman
would
go
and
do
wrong
of
his
own
accord
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
noble
-
spoken
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
people
are
there
in
the
world
,
who
,
for
no
better
reason
,
uphold
their
Pecksniffs
to
the
last
and
abandon
virtuous
men
,
when
Pecksniffs
breathe
upon
them
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Pinch
,
"
pursued
the
landlady
,
"
if
ever
there
was
a
dear
,
good
,
pleasant
,
worthy
soul
alive
,
Pinch
,
and
no
other
,
is
his
name
.
<EOS>
But
how
do
we
know
that
old
Mr
Chuzzlewit
himself
was
not
the
cause
of
difference
arising
between
him
and
Mr
Pecksniff
?
 
<EOS>
No
one
but
themselves
can
tell
;
for
Mr
Pinch
has
a
proud
spirit
,
though
he
has
such
a
quiet
way
;
and
when
he
left
us
,
and
was
so
sorry
to
go
,
he
scorned
to
make
his
story
good
,
even
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
old
Tom
!
"
said
Martin
,
in
a
tone
that
sounded
like
remorse
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
comfort
to
know
,
"
resumed
the
landlady
,
"
that
he
has
his
sister
living
with
him
,
and
is
doing
well
.
 
<EOS>
Only
yesterday
he
sent
me
back
,
by
post
,
a
little
"
---
here
the
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
---
 
"
<EOS>
a
little
trifle
<EOS>
I
was
bold
enough
to
lend
him
when
he
went
away
;
saying
,
with
many
thanks
,
that
he
had
good
employment
,
and
did
n't
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
note
;
he
had
n't
broken
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
I
could
have
been
so
little
pleased
to
see
a
bank
-
note
come
back
to
me
as
I
was
to
see
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Kindly
said
,
and
heartily
!
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
,
Mark
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
ca
n't
say
anything
as
does
not
possess
them
qualities
,
"
returned
Mr
Tapley
;
"
which
as
much
belongs
to
the
Dragon
as
its
licence
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
that
we
have
got
quite
cool
and
fresh
,
to
the
subject
again
,
sir
;
what
will
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
're
not
proud
,
and
can
make
up
your
mind
to
go
through
with
what
you
spoke
of
,
coming
along
,
that
's
the
course
for
you
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
started
wrong
with
your
grandfather
(
which
,
you
'll
excuse
my
taking
the
liberty
of
saying
,
appears
to
have
been
the
case
)
,
up
with
you
,
sir
,
and
tell
him
so
,
and
make
an
appeal
to
his
affections
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
stand
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
great
deal
older
than
you
,
and
if
he
was
hasty
,
you
was
hasty
too
.
<EOS>
Give
way
,
sir
,
give
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
eloquence
of
Mr
Tapley
was
not
without
its
effect
on
Martin
<EOS>
but
he
still
hesitated
,
and
expressed
his
reason
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
true
,
and
perfectly
correct
,
Mark
;
and
if
it
were
a
mere
question
of
humbling
myself
before
HIM
,
I
would
not
consider
it
twice
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
see
,
that
being
wholly
under
this
hypocrite
's
government
,
and
having
(
if
what
we
hear
be
true
)
<EOS>
no
mind
or
will
of
his
own
<EOS>
,
I
throw
myself
,
in
fact
,
not
at
his
feet
,
but
at
the
feet
of
Mr
Pecksniff
?
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
am
rejected
and
spurned
away
,
"
said
Martin
,
turning
crimson
at
the
thought
<EOS>
,
"
it
is
not
by
him
;
<EOS>
my
own
blood
stirred
against
me
;
but
by
Pecksniff
---
Pecksniff
,
Mark
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
we
know
beforehand
,
"
returned
the
politic
Mr
Tapley
,
"
that
Pecksniff
is
a
wagabond
,
a
scoundrel
,
and
a
willain
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
most
pernicious
villain
!
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
most
pernicious
willain
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
that
beforehand
,
sir
;
and
,
consequently
,
it
's
no
shame
to
be
defeated
by
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Blow
Pecksniff
!
"
cried
Mr
Tapley
,
in
the
fervour
of
his
eloquence
.
<EOS>
"
Who
's
he
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
in
the
natur
of
Pecksniff
to
shame
US
,
unless
he
agreed
with
us
,
or
done
us
a
service
;
and
,
in
case
he
offered
any
audacity
of
that
description
,
we
could
express
our
sentiments
in
the
English
language
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Pecksniff
!
"
repeated
Mr
Tapley
,
with
ineffable
disdain
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
Pecksniff
,
who
's
Pecksniff
,
where
's
Pecksniff
,
that
he
's
to
be
so
much
considered
?
 
<EOS>
We
're
not
a
-
calculating
for
ourselves
;
"
he
laid
uncommon
emphasis
on
the
last
syllable
of
that
word
,
and
looked
full
in
Martin
's
face
;
"
we
're
making
a
effort
for
a
young
lady
likewise
as
has
undergone
her
share
;
and
whatever
little
hope
we
have
,
this
here
Pecksniff
is
not
to
stand
in
its
way
,
I
expect
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
of
any
act
of
Parliament
,
as
was
made

Pecksniff
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
would
n't
see
the
man
myself
;
I
would
n't
hear
him
;
I
would
n't
choose
to
know
he
was
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
scrape
my
shoes
on
the
scraper
of
the
door
,
and
call
that
Pecksniff
,
if
you
liked
;
but
I
would
n't
condescend
no
further
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
amazement
of
Mrs
Lupin
,
and
indeed
of
Mr
Tapley
himself
for
that
matter
,
at
this
impassioned
flow
of
language
,
was
immense
.
 
<EOS>
But
Martin
,
after
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
for
a
short
time
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
You
are
right
,
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
Right
or
wrong
,
it
shall
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
word
more
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
think
of
him
so
far
as
not
to
give
him
a
handle
against
you
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
do
anything
secret
that
he
can
report
before
you
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
even
see
Miss
Mary
in
the
morning
,
but
let
this
here
dear
friend
of
ours
"
---
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
bestowed
a
smile
upon
the
hostess
---
"
prepare
her
for
what
's
a
-
going
to
happen
,
and
carry
any
little
message
as
may
be
agreeable
.
<EOS>
She
knows
how
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
laughed
and
tossed
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
go
in
,
bold
and
free
as
a
gentleman
should
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
done
nothing
under
-
handed
,
"
says
you
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
been
skulking
about
the
premises
,
here
I
am
,
for
-
give
me
<EOS>
,
I
ask
your
pardon
,
God
Bless
You
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
Martin
smiled
,
but
felt
that
it
was
good
advice
notwithstanding
,
and
resolved
to
act
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
ascertained
from
Mrs
Lupin
that
Pecksniff
had
already
returned
from
the
great
ceremonial
at
which
they
had
beheld
him
in
his
glory
;
and
when
they
had
fully
arranged
the
order
of
their
proceedings
;
they
went
to
bed
,
intent
upon
the
morrow
.
   
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
their
project
as
agreed
upon
at
this
discussion
,
Mr
Tapley
issued
forth
next
morning
,
after
breakfast
,
charged
with
a
letter
from
Martin
to
his
grandfather
,
requesting
leave
to
wait
upon
him
for
a
few
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
And
postponing
as
he
went
along
the
congratulations
of
his
numerous
friends
until
a
more
convenient
season
,
he
soon
arrived
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
gentleman
's
door
;
with
a
face
so
immovable
that
it
would
have
been
next
to
an
impossibility
for
the
most
acute
physiognomist
to
determine
what
he
was
thinking
about
,
or
whether
he
was
thinking
at
all
;
he
straightway
knocked
.
   
<EOS>
A
person
of
Mr
Tapley
's
observation
could
not
long
remain
insensible
to
the
fact
that
Mr
Pecksniff
was
making
the
end
of
his
nose
very
blunt
against
the
glass
of
the
parlour
window
,
in
an
angular
attempt
to
discover
who
had
knocked
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
Mr
Tapley
slow
to
baffle
this
movement
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
,
by
perching
himself
on
the
top
step
,
and
presenting
the
crown
of
his
hat
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
But
possibly
Mr
Pecksniff
had
already
seen
him
,
for
Mark
<EOS>
soon
heard
his
shoes
creaking
,
as
he
advanced
to
open
the
door
with
his
own
hands
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
was
as
cheerful
as
ever
,
and
sang
a
little
song
in
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
,
sir
?
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tapley
,
I
believe
?
 
<EOS>
The
Prodigal
returned
!
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
want
any
beer
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
accommodate
you
if
you
did
.
<EOS>
A
letter
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
me
?
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
an
answer
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
for
you
,
I
think
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
,
pointing
out
the
direction
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Chuzzlewit
,
I
believe
the
name
is
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
returned
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Who
's
it
from
,
my
good
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
it
comes
from
wrote
his
name
inside
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Tapley
with
extreme
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
a
-
signing
of
it
at
the
end
,
while
I
was
a
-
waitin
'
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
he
said
he
wanted
an
answer
,
did
he
?
"
asked
Mr
Pecksniff
in
his
most
persuasive
manner
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
shall
have
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
tearing
the
letter
into
small
pieces
,
as
mildly
as
if
that
were
the
most
flattering
attention
a
correspondent
could
receive
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
give
him
that
,
with
my
compliments
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
handed
Mark
the
scraps
;
retired
,
and
shut
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
thought
it
prudent
to
subdue
his
personal
emotions
,
and
return
to
Martin
at
the
Dragon
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
unprepared
for
such
a
reception
,
and
suffered
an
hour
or
so
to
elapse
before
making
another
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
interval
had
gone
by
,
they
returned
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
knocked
this
time
,
while
Mr
Tapley
prepared
himself
to
keep
the
door
open
with
his
foot
and
shoulder
,
when
anybody
came
,
and
by
that
means
secure
an
enforced
parley
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
precaution
was
needless
,
for
the
servant
-
girl
appeared
almost
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
Brushing
quickly
past
her
as
he
had
resolved
in
such
a
case
to
do
<EOS>
,
Martin
(
closely
followed
by
his
faithful
ally
)
opened
the
door
of
that
parlour
in
which
he
knew
a
visitor
was
most
likely
to
be
found
;
passed
at
once
into
the
room
;
and
stood
,
without
a
word
of
notice
or
announcement
,
in
the
presence
of
his
grandfather
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
also
was
in
the
room
;
and
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
swift
instant
of
their
mutual
recognition
,
Martin
saw
the
old
man
droop
his
grey
head
,
and
hide
his
face
in
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
It
smote
him
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
most
selfish
and
most
careless
day
,
this
lingering
remnant
of
the
old
man
's
ancient
love
,
this
buttress
of
a
ruined
tower
he
had
built
up
in
the
time
gone
by
,
with
so
much
pride
and
hope
,
would
have
caused
a
pang
in
Martin
's
heart
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
changed
for
the
better
in
his
worst
respect
;
looking
through
an
altered
medium
on
his
former
friend
,
the
guardian
of
his
childhood
,
so
broken
and
bowed
down
;
resentment
,
sullenness
,
self
-
confidence
,
and
pride
,
were
all
swept
away
,
before
the
starting
tears
upon
the
withered
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
think
they
fell
at
sight
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
view
reflected
in
them
,
the
reproachful
and
irrevocable
Past
.
   
<EOS>
He
hurriedly
advanced
to
seize
the
old
man
's
hand
in
his
,
when
Mr
Pecksniff
interposed
himself
between
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
young
man
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
striking
himself
upon
the
breast
,
and
stretching
out
his
other
arm
towards
his
guest
as
if
it
were
a
wing
to
shelter
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Strike
here
,
sir
,
here
!
 
<EOS>
Launch
your
arrows
at
me
,
sir
,
if
you
'll
have
the
goodness
;
not
at
Him
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Grandfather
!
"
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
implore
you
,
let
me
speak
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
dodging
about
,
so
as
to
keep
himself
always
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
enough
,
sir
,
that
you
come
into
my
house
like
a
thief
in
the
night
,
or
I
should
rather
say
,
for
we
can
never
be
too
particular
on
the
subject
of
Truth
,
like
a
thief
in
the
day
-
time
;
bringing
your
dissolute
companions
with
you
,
to
plant
themselves
with
their
backs
against
the
insides
of
parlour
doors
,
and
prevent
the
entrance
or
issuing
forth
of
any
of
my
household
"
---
Mark
had
taken
up
this
position
,
and
held
it
quite
unmoved
---
"
but
would
you
also
strike
at
venerable
Virtue
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
?
 
<EOS>
Know
that
it
is
not
defenceless
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
its
shield
,
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
Assail
me
.
 
<EOS>
Come
on
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Fire
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pecksniff
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
in
a
feeble
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Calm
yourself
.
<EOS>
Be
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
be
calm
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
and
I
wo
n't
be
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
My
benefactor
and
my
friend
!
 
<EOS>
Shall
even
my
house
be
no
refuge
for
your
hoary
pillow
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stand
aside
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
old
man
,
stretching
out
his
hand
;
"
and
let
me
see
what
it
is
I
used
to
love
so
dearly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
right
that
you
should
see
it
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
that
you
should
see
it
,
my
noble
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
desirable
that
you
should
contemplate
it
in
its
true
proportions
.
 
<EOS>
Behold
it
!
<EOS>
There
it
is
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
There
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
could
hardly
be
a
mortal
man
,
and
not
express
in
his
face
something
of
the
anger
and
disdain
with
which
Mr
Pecksniff
inspired
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
beyond
this
he
evinced
no
knowledge
whatever
of
that
gentleman
's
presence
or
existence
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
he
had
once
,
and
that
at
first
,
glanced
at
him
involuntarily
,
and
with
supreme
contempt
;
but
for
any
other
heed
he
took
of
him
,
there
might
have
been
nothing
in
his
place
save
empty
air
.
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Pecksniff
withdrew
from
between
them
,
agreeably
to
the
wish
just
now
expressed
(
which
he
did
during
the
delivery
of
the
observations
last
recorded
)
,
old
Martin
,
who
had
taken
Mary
Graham
's
hand
in
his
,
and
whispered
kindly
to
her
,
as
telling
her
she
had
no
cause
to
be
alarmed
,
gently
pushed
her
from
him
,
behind
his
chair
;
and
looked
steadily
at
his
grandson
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
he
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
is
he
!
 
<EOS>
Say
what
you
wish
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
no
nearer
,
"
   
"
His
sense
of
justice
is
so
fine
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
that
he
will
hear
even
him
,
although
he
knows
beforehand
that
nothing
can
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ingenuous
mind
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
did
not
address
himself
immediately
to
any
person
in
saying
this
,
but
assuming
the
position
of
the
Chorus
in
a
Greek
Tragedy
,
delivered
his
opinion
as
a
commentary
on
the
proceedings
.
   
<EOS>
"
Grandfather
!
<EOS>
"
said
Martin
,
with
great
earnestness
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
a
painful
journey
,
from
a
hard
life
,
from
a
sick
-
bed
,
from
privation
and
distress
,
from
gloom
and
disappointment
,
from
almost
hopelessness
and
despair
,
I
have
come
back
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rovers
of
this
sort
,
"
observed
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
Chorus
,
"
<EOS>
very
commonly
come
back
when
they
find
they
do
n't
meet
with
the
success
they
expected
in
their
marauding
ravages
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
for
this
faithful
man
,
"
said
Martin
,
turning
towards
Mark
,
"
whom
I
first
knew
in
this
place
,
and
who
went
away
with
me
voluntarily
,
as
a
servant
,
but
has
been
,
throughout
,
my
zealous
and
devoted
friend
;
<EOS>
but
for
him
,
I
must
have
died
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Far
from
home
,
far
from
any
help
or
consolation
;
far
from
the
probability
even
of
my
wretched
fate
being
ever
known
to
any
one
who
cared
to
hear
it
---
oh
,
that
you
would
let
me
say
,
of
being
known
to
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
at
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
looked
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
speak
,
my
worthy
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
answered
in
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
you
thought
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
another
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
go
on
my
friend
.
<EOS>
The
development
of
self
-
interest
in
the
human
mind
is
always
a
curious
study
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
go
on
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
!
"
<EOS>
observed
the
old
man
;
in
a
mechanical
obedience
,
it
appeared
,
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
suggestion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
so
wretched
and
so
poor
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
that
I
am
indebted
to
the
charitable
help
of
a
stranger
,
in
a
land
of
strangers
,
for
the
means
of
returning
here
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
tells
against
me
in
your
mind
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
cause
to
think
I
have
been
driven
here
wholly
by
want
,
and
have
not
been
led
on
,
in
any
degree
,
by
affection
or
regret
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
parted
from
you
,
Grandfather
,
I
deserved
that
suspicion
,
but
I
do
not
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
Chorus
put
its
hand
in
its
waistcoat
,
and
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
go
on
,
my
worthy
sir
,
"
it
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
you
are
thinking
of
,
but
do
n't
express
it
prematurely
.
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
raised
his
eyes
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
face
,
and
appearing
to
derive
renewed
instruction
from
his
looks
and
words
,
said
,
once
again
:
   
"
Go
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
little
more
to
say
,
"
returned
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
as
I
say
it
now
,
with
little
or
no
hope
,
Grandfather
;
whatever
dawn
of
hope
I
had
on
entering
the
room
;
believe
it
to
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
,
believe
it
to
be
true
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beautiful
Truth
!
"
exclaimed
the
Chorus
,
looking
upward
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
is
your
name
profaned
by
vicious
persons
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
live
in
a
well
,
my
holy
principle
,
but
on
the
lips
of
false
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
bear
with
mankind
,
dear
sir
"
---
addressing
the
elder
Mr
Chuzzlewit
;
"
but
let
us
do
so
meekly
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
our
duty
so
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
be
among
the
Few
who
do
their
duty
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
"
pursued
the
Chorus
,
soaring
up
into
a
lofty
flight
,
"
as
the
poet
informs
us
,
England
expects
Every
man
to
do
his
duty
,
England
is
the
most
sanguine
country
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
will
find
itself
continually
disappointed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
that
subject
,
"
said
Martin
,
looking
calmly
at
the
old
man
as
he
spoke
,
but
glancing
once
at
Mary
,
whose
face
was
now
buried
in
her
hands
,
upon
the
back
of
his
easy
-
chair
;
"
upon
that
subject
which
first
occasioned
a
division
between
us
,
<EOS>
my
mind
and
heart
are
incapable
of
change
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
influence
they
have
undergone
,
since
that
unhappy
time
,
has
not
been
one
to
weaken
but
to
strengthen
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
profess
sorrow
for
that
,
nor
irresolution
in
that
,
nor
shame
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
would
you
wish
me
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
I
might
have
trusted
to
your
love
,
if
I
had
thrown
myself
manfully
upon
it
;
that
I
might
have
won
you
over
with
ease
,
if
I
had
been
more
yielding
and
more
considerate
;
that
I
should
have
best
remembered
myself
in
forgetting
myself
,
and
recollecting
you
;
reflection
,
solitude
,
and
misery
,
have
taught
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
resolved
to
say
this
,
and
to
ask
your
forgiveness
;
not
so
much
in
hope
for
the
future
,
as
in
regret
for
the
past
;
for
all
that
I
would
ask
of
you
is
,
that
you
would
aid
me
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
Help
me
to
get
honest
work
to
do
,
and
I
would
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
condition
places
me
at
the
disadvantage
of
seeming
to
have
only
my
selfish
ends
to
serve
,
but
try
if
that
be
so
or
not
.
<EOS>
Try
if
I
be
self
-
willed
,
obdurate
,
and
haughty
,
as
I
was
;
or
have
been
disciplined
in
a
rough
school
.
 
<EOS>
Let
the
voice
of
nature
and
association
plead
between
us
,
Grandfather
;
and
do
not
,
for
one
fault
,
however
thankless
,
quite
reject
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
ceased
,
the
grey
head
of
the
old
man
drooped
again
;
and
he
concealed
his
face
behind
his
outspread
fingers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
bending
over
him
,
"
you
must
not
give
way
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
natural
,
and
very
amiable
,
but
you
must
not
allow
the
shameless
conduct
of
one
whom
you
long
ago
cast
off
,
to
move
you
so
far
.
 
<EOS>
Rouse
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Think
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
"
think
of
Me
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
returned
old
Martin
,
looking
up
into
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
recall
me
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
sitting
down
beside
him
in
a
chair
which
he
drew
up
for
the
purpose
,
and
tapping
him
playfully
on
the
arm
<EOS>
,
"
what
is
the
matter
with
my
strong
-
minded
compatriot
,
if
I
may
venture
to
take
the
liberty
of
calling
him
by
that
endearing
expression
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
have
to
scold
my
coadjutor
,
or
to
reason
with
an
intellect
like
this

<EOS>
I
think
not

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
occasion
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
momentary
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indignation
,
"
observed
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
WILL
bring
the
scalding
tear
into
the
honest
eye
,
I
know
"
---
he
wiped
his
own
elaborately
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
we
have
highest
duties
to
perform
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
Rouse
yourself
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
give
expression
to
your
thoughts
,
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
old
Martin
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
and
looking
at
him
,
half
in
vacancy
and
half
in
admiration
,
as
if
he
were
fascinated
by
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
for
me
,
Pecksniff
,
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
true
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
not
unman
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shaking
his
hand
vigorously
,
"
or
I
shall
be
unequal
to
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
agreeable
to
my
feelings
,
my
good
sir
,
to
address
the
person
who
is
now
before
us
,
for
when
I
ejected
him
from
this
house
,
<EOS>
after
hearing
of
his
unnatural
conduct
from
your
lips
,
I
renounced
communication
with
him
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
desire
it
;
and
that
is
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
Young
man
!
<EOS>
The
door
is
immediately
behind
the
companion
of
your
infamy
.
 
<EOS>
Blush
if
you
can
;
begone
without
a
blush
,
if
you
ca
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
looked
as
steadily
at
his
grandfather
as
if
there
had
been
a
dead
silence
all
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
no
less
steadily
at
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
ordered
you
to
leave
this
house
upon
the
last
occasion
of
your
being
dismissed
from
it
with
disgrace
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
;
"
when
,
stung
and
stimulated
beyond
endurance
by
your
shameless
conduct
to
this
extraordinarily
noble
-
minded
individual
,
I
exclaimed
"
Go
forth
!
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
that
I
wept
for
your
depravity
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
suppose
that
the
tear
which
stands
in
my
eye
at
this
moment
,
is
shed
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
shed
for
him
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
shed
for
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pecksniff
,
accidentally
dropping
the
tear
in
question
on
a
bald
part
of
Mr
Chuzzlewit
's
head
,
wiped
the
place
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
begged
pardon
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
shed
for
him
,
sir
,
whom
you
seek
to
make
the
victim
of
your
arts
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
;
"
whom
you
seek
to
plunder
,
to
deceive
,
and
to
mislead
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
shed
in
sympathy
with
him
,
and
admiration
of
him
;
not
in
pity
for
him
,
for
happily
he
knows
what
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
not
wrong
him
further
,
sir
,
in
any
way
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
quite
transported
with
enthusiasm
,
"
while
I
have
life
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
bestride
my
senseless
corse
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
very
likely
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
a
mind
like
yours
deriving
great
satisfaction
from
any
measure
of
that
kind
.
 
<EOS>
But
while
I
continue
to
be
called
upon
to
exist
,
sir
,
you
must
strike
at
him
through
me
.
 
<EOS>
Awe
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shaking
his
head
at
Martin
with
indignant
jocularity
;
"
and
in
such
a
cause
you
will
find
me
,
my
young
sir
,
an
Ugly
Customer
!
"
   
<EOS>
Still
Martin
looked
steadily
and
mildly
at
his
grandfather
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
no
answer
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
,
"
not
a
word
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
hear
what
has
been
said
,
"
replied
the
old
man
,
without
averting
his
eyes
from
the
face
of
Mr
Pecksniff
;
who
nodded
encouragingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
heard
your
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
your
spirit
,
"
returned
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
again
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
still
gazing
up
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
only
hear
,
"
replied
Martin
,
strong
in
his
purpose
from
the
first
,
and
stronger
in
it
as
he
felt
how
Pecksniff
winced
and
shrunk
beneath
his
contempt
;
"
I
only
hear
what
you
say
to
me
,
grandfather
.
"
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
well
for
Mr
Pecksniff
that
his
venerable
friend
found
in
his
<EOS>
(
Mr
Pecksniff
's
)
features
an
exclusive
and
engrossing
object
of
contemplation
,
for
if
his
eyes
had
gone
astray
,
and
he
had
compared
young
Martin
's
bearing
with
that
of
his
zealous
defender
,
the
latter
disinterested
gentleman
would
scarcely
have
shown
to
greater
advantage
than
on
the
memorable
afternoon
when
he
took
Tom
Pinch
's
last
receipt
in
full
of
all
demands
.
 
<EOS>
One
really
might
have
thought
there
was
some
quality
in
Mr
Pecksniff
---
an
emanation
from
the
brightness
and
purity
within
him
perhaps
---
which
set
off
and
adorned
his
foes
;
they
looked
so
gallant
and
so
manly
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
?
<EOS>
"
said
Martin
,
for
the
second
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
I
have
a
word
to
say
,
Pecksniff
,
"
observed
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
You
spoke
of
being
indebted
to
the
charitable
help
of
some
stranger
for
the
means
of
returning
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
Who
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
And
what
help
in
money
did
he
render
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Although
he
asked
this
question
of
Martin
,
he
did
not
look
towards
him
,
but
kept
his
eyes
on
Mr
Pecksniff
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
have
become
a
habit
with
him
,
both
in
a
literal
and
figurative
sense
,
to
look
to
Mr
Pecksniff
alone
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
took
out
his
pencil
,
tore
a
leaf
from
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
hastily
wrote
down
the
particulars
of
his
debt
to
Mr
Bevan
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
paper
,
and
took
it
;
but
his
eyes
did
not
wander
from
Mr
Pecksniff
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
poor
pride
and
a
false
humility
,
"
said
Martin
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
to
say
,
I
do
not
wish
that
to
be
paid
,
or
that
I
have
any
present
hope
of
being
able
to
pay
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
felt
my
poverty
so
deeply
as
I
feel
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Read
it
to
me
,
Pecksniff
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
,
after
approaching
the
perusal
of
the
paper
as
if
it
were
a
manuscript
confession
of
a
murder
,
complied
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Pecksniff
,
"
said
old
Martin
,
"
I
could
wish
that
to
be
discharged
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
the
lender
,
who
was
abroad
,
who
had
no
opportunity
of
making
inquiry
,
and
who
did
(
as
he
thought
)
a
kind
action
,
to
suffer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
An
honourable
sentiment
,
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Your
own
entirely
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
dangerous
precedent
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
permit
me
to
suggest
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
shall
not
be
a
precedent
,
"
returned
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
only
recognition
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
will
talk
of
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
advise
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
else
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
else
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
buoyantly
,
"
but
for
you
to
recover
this
intrusion
---
this
cowardly
and
indefensible
outrage
on
your
feelings
---
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
and
smile
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
more
to
say
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
old
man
,
laying
his
hand
with
unusual
earnestness
on
Mr
Pecksniff
's
sleeve
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
would
not
say
what
rose
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
For
reproaches
he
observed
,
were
useless
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
at
all
to
urge
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
sure
of
that
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
,
no
matter
what
it
is
,
speak
freely
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
oppose
nothing
that
you
ask
of
me
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
The
tears
rose
in
such
abundance
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
eyes
at
this
proof
of
unlimited
confidence
on
the
part
of
his
friend
,
that
he
was
fain
to
clasp
the
bridge
of
his
nose
convulsively
before
he
could
at
all
compose
himself
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
the
power
of
utterance
again
,
he
said
with
great
emotion
,
that
he
hoped
he
should
live
to
deserve
this
;
and
added
,
that
he
had
no
other
observation
whatever
to
make
.
   
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
the
old
man
sat
looking
at
him
,
with
that
blank
and
motionless
expression
which
is
not
uncommon
in
the
faces
of
those
whose
faculties
are
on
the
wane
,
in
age
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
rose
up
firmly
too
,
and
walked
towards
the
door
,
from
which
Mark
withdrew
to
make
way
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
obsequious
Mr
Pecksniff
proffered
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
took
it
.
<EOS>
Turning
at
the
door
,
he
said
to
Martin
,
waving
him
off
with
his
hand
,
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
him
.
 
<EOS>
Go
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
Go
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
murmured
certain
cheering
expressions
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
as
they
retired
;
and
Martin
,
awakening
from
the
stupor
into
which
the
closing
portion
of
this
scene
had
plunged
him
,
to
the
opportunity
afforded
by
their
departure
,
caught
the
innocent
cause
of
all
in
his
embrace
,
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
girl
!
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
changed
you
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
what
an
impotent
and
harmless
<EOS>
knave
the
fellow
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
restrained
yourself
so
nobly
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
borne
so
much
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Restrained
myself
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
by
,
and
were
unchanged
,
I
knew
.
 
<EOS>
What
more
advantage
did
I
want
?
 
<EOS>
The
sight
of
me
was
such
a
bitterness
to
the
dog
,
that
I
had
my
triumph
in
his
being
forced
to
endure
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
love
---
for
the
few
hasty
words
we
can
exchange
now
are
precious
---
what
is
this
which
has
been
rumoured
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
true
that
you
are
persecuted
by
this
knave
's
addresses
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
dear
Martin
,
and
to
some
extent
am
now
;
but
my
chief
source
of
unhappiness
has
been
anxiety
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
leave
us
in
such
terrible
suspense
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sickness
,
distance
;
the
dread
of
hinting
at
our
real
condition
,
the
impossibility
of
concealing
it
except
in
perfect
silence
;
the
knowledge
that
the
truth
would
have
pained
you
infinitely
more
than
uncertainty
and
doubt
,
"
said
Martin
,
hurriedly
;
as
indeed
everything
else
was
done
and
said
,
in
those
few
hurried
moments
,
"
were
the
causes
of
my
writing
only
once
.
 
<EOS>
But
Pecksniff
?
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
fear
to
tell
me
the
whole
tale
;
for
you
saw
me
with
him
face
to
face
,
hearing
him
speak
,
and
not
taking
him
by
the
throat
;
what
is
the
history
of
his
pursuit
of
you
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
known
to
my
grandfather
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
assists
him
in
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
answered
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
"
that
it
leaves
his
mind
unclouded
in
that
one
respect
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
it
was
known
to
him
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
man
had
sufficiently
prepared
his
mind
,
he
revealed
it
to
him
by
degrees
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
,
but
<EOS>
I
only
know
it
from
my
own
impression
:
now
from
anything
they
told
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
spoke
to
me
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
grandfather
did
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
---
spoke
to
me
alone
,
and
told
me
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
hound
had
said
,
"
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
repeat
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
said
I
knew
well
what
qualities
he
possessed
;
that
he
was
moderately
rich
;
in
good
repute
;
and
high
in
his
favour
and
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
But
seeing
me
very
much
distressed
,
he
said
that
he
would
not
control
or
force
my
inclinations
,
but
would
content
himself
with
telling
me
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
pain
me
by
dwelling
on
it
,
or
reverting
to
it
;
nor
has
he
ever
done
so
since
,
but
has
truly
kept
his
word
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
man
himself
?
<EOS>
---
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
had
few
opportunities
of
pursuing
his
suit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
walked
out
alone
,
or
remained
alone
an
instant
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
Dear
Martin
,
I
must
tell
you
,
"
she
continued
,
"
that
the
kindness
of
your
grandfather
to
me
remains
unchanged
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
his
companion
still
.
<EOS>
An
indescribable
tenderness
and
compassion
seem
to
have
mingled
themselves
with
his
old
regard
;
and
if
I
were
his
only
child
,
I
could
not
have
a
gentler
father
.
 
<EOS>
What
former
fancy
or
old
habit
survives
in
this
,
when
his
heart
has
turned
so
cold
to
you
,
is
a
mystery
I
can
not
penetrate
;
but
it
has
been
,
and
it
is
,
a
happiness
to
me
,
that
I
remained
true
to
him
;
that
if
he
should
wake
from
his
delusion
,
even
at
the
point
of
death
,
I
am
here
,
love
,
to
recall
you
to
his
thoughts
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
looked
with
admiration
on
her
glowing
face
,
and
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
sometimes
heard
,
and
read
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
those
whose
powers
had
been
enfeebled
long
ago
,
and
whose
lives
had
faded
,
as
it
were
,
into
a
dream
,
have
been
known
to
rouse
themselves
before
death
,
and
inquire
for
familiar
faces
once
very
dear
to
them
;
but
forgotten
,
unrecognized
,
hated
even
,
in
the
meantime
.
 
<EOS>
Think
,
if
with
his
old
impressions
of
this
man
,
he
should
suddenly
resume
his
former
self
,
and
find
in
him
his
only
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
urge
you
to
abandon
him
,
dearest
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
though
I
could
count
the
years
we
are
to
wear
out
asunder
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
influence
this
fellow
exercises
over
him
has
steadily
increased
,
I
fear
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
admitting
that
.
 
<EOS>
Steadily
,
imperceptibly
,
and
surely
,
until
it
was
paramount
and
supreme
.
 
<EOS>
She
herself
had
none
;
and
yet
he
treated
her
with
more
affection
than
at
any
previous
time
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
thought
the
inconsistency
a
part
of
his
weakness
and
decay
.
   
<EOS>
"
Does
the
influence
extend
to
fear
?
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
timid
of
asserting
his
own
opinion
in
the
presence
of
this
infatuation
?
 
<EOS>
I
fancied
so
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
so
,
often
.
 
<EOS>
Often
when
we
are
sitting
alone
,
almost
as
we
used
to
do
,
and
I
have
been
reading
a
favourite
book
to
him
or
he
has
been
talking
quite
cheerfully
<EOS>
,
I
have
observed
that
the
entrance
of
Mr
Pecksniff
has
changed
his
whole
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
broken
off
immediately
,
and
become
what
you
have
seen
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
first
came
here
he
had
his
impetuous
outbreaks
,
in
which
it
was
not
easy
for
Mr
Pecksniff
with
his
utmost
plausibility
to
appease
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
have
long
since
dwindled
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
defers
to
him
in
everything
,
and
has
no
opinion
upon
any
question
,
but
that
which
is
forced
upon
him
by
this
treacherous
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
account
,
rapidly
furnished
in
whispers
,
and
interrupted
,
brief
as
it
was
,
by
many
false
alarms
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
return
;
which
Martin
received
of
his
grandfather
's
decline
,
and
of
that
good
gentleman
's
ascendancy
.
 
<EOS>
He
heard
of
Tom
Pinch
too
,
and
Jonas
too
,
with
not
a
little
about
himself
into
the
bargain
;
for
though
lovers
are
remarkable
for
leaving
a
great
deal
unsaid
on
all
occasions
,
and
very
properly
desiring
to
come
back
and
say
it
,
they
are
remarkable
also
for
a
wonderful
power
of
condensation
,
and
can
,
in
one
way
or
other
,
give
utterance
to
more
language
---
eloquent
language
---
in
any
given
short
space
of
time
,
than
all
the
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
eight
members
in
the
Commons
House
of
Parliament
of
the
United
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
;
who
are
strong
lovers
no
doubt
,
but
of
their
country
only
,
which
makes
all
the
difference
;
for
in
a
passion
of
that
kind
(
which
is
not
always
returned
)
,
it
is
the
custom
to
use
as
many
words
as
possible
,
and
express
nothing
whatever
.
   
<EOS>
A
caution
from
Mr
Tapley
;
a
hasty
interchange
of
farewells
,
and
of
something
else
which
the
proverb
says
must
not
be
told
of
afterwards
;
a
white
hand
held
out
to
Mr
Tapley
himself
,
which
he
kissed
with
the
devotion
of
a
knight
-
errant
;
more
farewells
,
more
something
else
's
;
a
parting
word
from
Martin
that
he
would
write
from
London
and
would
do
great
things
there
yet
<EOS>
(
Heaven
knows
what
,
but
he
quite
believed
it
)
;
and
Mark
and
he
stood
on
the
outside
of
the
Pecksniffian
halls
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
short
interview
after
such
an
absence
!
<EOS>
"
said
Martin
,
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
are
well
out
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
We
might
have
placed
ourselves
in
a
false
position
by
remaining
there
,
even
so
long
,
Mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
ourselves
,
sir
,
"
he
returned
;
"
but
somebody
else
would
have
got
into
a
false
position
,
if
he
had
happened
to
come
back
again
,
while
we
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
door
all
ready
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
If
Pecksniff
had
showed
his
head
,
or
had
only
so
much
as
listened
behind
it
,
I
would
have
caught
him
like
a
walnut
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
the
sort
of
man
,
"
added
Mr
Tapley
,
musing
,
"
as
would
squeeze
soft
,
I
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
person
who
was
evidently
going
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
,
passed
them
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
his
eyes
at
the
mention
of
the
architect
's
name
;
and
when
he
had
gone
on
a
few
yards
,
stopped
and
gazed
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
,
also
,
looked
over
his
shoulder
,
and
so
did
Martin
;
for
the
stranger
,
as
he
passed
,
had
looked
very
sharply
at
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
may
that
be
,
I
wonder
!
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
face
seems
familiar
to
me
,
but
I
do
n't
know
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
seems
to
have
a
amiable
desire
that
his
face
should
be
tolerable
familiar
to
us
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
"
for
he
's
a
-
staring
pretty
hard
.
<EOS>
He
'd
better
not
waste
his
beauty
,
for
he
ai
n't
got
much
to
spare
.
"
   
<EOS>
Coming
in
sight
of
the
Dragon
,
they
saw
a
travelling
carriage
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
Salisbury
carriage
,
eh
?
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
he
came
in
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
in
the
wind
now
?
 
<EOS>
A
new
pupil
,
I
should
n't
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
P'raps
it
's
a
order
for
another
grammar
-
school
,
of
the
same
pattern
as
the
last
.
"
   
<EOS>
Before
they
could
enter
at
the
door
,
Mrs
Lupin
came
running
out
;
and
beckoning
them
to
the
carriage
showed
them
a
portmanteau
with
the
name
of
CHUZZLEWIT
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Pecksniff
's
husband
that
was
,
"
said
the
good
woman
to
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
what
terms
you
might
be
on
,
and
was
quite
in
a
worry
till
you
came
back
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
and
I
have
never
interchanged
a
word
yet
,
"
observed
Martin
;
"
and
as
I
have
no
wish
to
be
better
or
worse
acquainted
with
him
,
I
will
not
put
myself
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
We
passed
him
on
the
road
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
he
timed
his
coming
as
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
's
husband
travels
gaily
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
fine
-
looking
gentleman
with
him
---
in
the
best
room
now
,
"
whispered
Mrs
Lupin
,
glancing
up
at
the
window
as
they
went
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
ordered
everything
that
can
be
got
for
dinner
;
and
has
the
glossiest
moustaches
and
whiskers
ever
you
saw
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
he
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
"
why
then
we
'll
endeavour
to
avoid
him
too
,
in
the
hope
that
our
self
-
denial
may
be
strong
enough
for
the
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
only
for
a
few
hours
,
"
said
Martin
,
dropping
wearily
into
a
chair
behind
the
little
screen
in
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
visit
has
met
with
no
success
,
my
dear
Mrs
Lupin
,
and
I
must
go
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear

cried
the
hostess
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
one
foul
wind
<EOS>
no
more
makes
a
winter
,
than
one
swallow
makes
a
summer
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
has
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
With
his
advice
to
guide
me
,
I
may
do
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
Tom
under
my
protection
once
,
God
save
the
mark
!
"
<EOS>
said
Martin
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
;
"
and
promised
I
would
make
his
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
Tom
will
take
me
under
HIS
protection
now
,
and
teach
me
how
to
earn
my
bread
.

Further
continuation
of
the
enterprise
of
Mr
Jonas
and
his
friend
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
special
quality
,
among
the
many
admirable
qualities
possessed
by
Mr
Pecksniff
,
that
the
more
he
was
found
out
,
the
more
hypocrisy
he
practised
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
be
discomfited
in
one
quarter
,
and
he
refreshed
and
recompensed
himself
by
carrying
the
war
into
another
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
workings
and
windings
were
detected
by
A
,
so
much
the
greater
reason
was
there
for
practicing
without
loss
of
time
on
B
,
if
it
were
only
to
keep
his
hand
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
such
a
saintly
and
improving
spectacle
to
all
about
him
,
as
after
his
detection
by
Thomas
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
ever
been
at
once
<EOS>
so
tender
in
his
humanity
,
and
so
dignified
and
exalted
in
his
virtue
,
as
when
young
Martin
's
scorn
was
fresh
and
hot
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
Having
this
large
stock
of
superfluous
sentiment
and
morality
on
hand
which
must
positively
be
cleared
off
at
any
sacrifice
,
Mr
Pecksniff
no
sooner
heard
his
son
-
in
-
law
announced
,
than
he
regarded
him
as
a
kind
of
wholesale
or
general
order
,
to
be
immediately
executed
.
 
<EOS>
Descending
,
therefore
,
swiftly
to
the
parlour
,
and
clasping
the
young
man
in
his
arms
,
he
exclaimed
,
with
looks
and
gestures
that
denoted
the
perturbation
of
his
spirit
:
   
<EOS>
"
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
My
child
---
she
is
well
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
you
're
at
it
again
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
replied
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
"
Even
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
Get
away
with
you
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
she
is
well
then
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
she
is
well
my
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
well
enough
,
"
retorted
Jonas
,
disengaging
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
the
matter
with
HER
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
the
matter
with
her
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
sitting
down
in
the
nearest
chair
,
and
rubbing
up
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fie
upon
my
weakness
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
,
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
better
now
.
<EOS>
How
is
my
other
child
;
my
eldest
;
my
Cherrywerrychigo
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
inventing
a
playful
little
name
for
her
,
in
the
restored
lightness
of
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
much
about
the
same
as
usual
,
"
returned
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
sticks
pretty
close
to
the
vinegar
-
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
she
's
got
a
sweetheart
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
of
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
from
headquarters
;
from
my
child
herself
I
will
not
deny
that
it
moved
me
to
contemplate
the
loss
of
my
remaining
daughter
,
Jonas
<EOS>
---
I
am
afraid
we
parents
are
selfish
,
I
am
afraid
we
are
---
but
it
has
ever
been
the
study
of
my
life
to
qualify
them
for
the
domestic
hearth
;
and
it
is
a
sphere
which
Cherry
will
adorn
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
need
adorn
some
sphere
or
other
,
"
observed
the
son
-
in
-
law
,
for
she
ai
n't
very
ornamental
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
girls
are
now
provided
for
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
now
happily
provided
for
,
and
I
have
not
laboured
in
vain
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
is
exactly
what
Mr
Pecksniff
would
have
said
,
if
one
of
his
daughters
had
drawn
a
prize
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
in
the
lottery
,
or
if
the
other
had
picked
up
a
valuable
purse
in
the
street
,
which
nobody
appeared
to
claim
.
 
<EOS>
In
either
of
these
cases
he
would
have
invoked
a
patriarchal
blessing
on
the
fortunate
head
,
with
great
solemnity
,
and
would
have
taken
immense
credit
to
himself
,
as
having
meant
it
from
the
infant
's
cradle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
we
talk
about
something
else
,
now
,
"
observed
Jonas
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"
just
for
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
agreeable
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
wag
,
you
naughty
wag
!
 
<EOS>
You
laugh
at
poor
old
fond
papa
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
He
deserves
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
do
n't
mind
it
either
,
for
his
feelings
are
their
own
reward
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
come
to
stay
with
me
,
Jonas
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
got
a
friend
with
me
,
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bring
your
friend
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
in
a
gush
of
hospitality
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
any
number
of
your
friends
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
ai
n't
the
sort
of
man
to
be
brought
,
"
said
Jonas
,
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
see
myself
"
bringing
"
him
to
your
house
,
for
a
treat
!
 
<EOS>
Thank'ee
all
the
same
;
but
he
's
a
little
too
near
the
top
of
the
tree
for
that
,
Pecksniff
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
good
man
pricked
up
his
ears
;
his
interest
was
awakened
.
 
<EOS>
A
position
near
the
top
of
the
tree
was
greatness
,
virtue
,
goodness
,
sense
,
genius
;
or
,
it
should
rather
be
said
,
a
dispensation
from
all
,
and
in
itself
something
immeasurably
better
than
all
;
with
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
who
was
able
to
look
down
upon
Mr
Pecksniff
could
not
be
looked
up
at
,
by
that
gentleman
,
with
too
great
an
amount
of
deference
,
or
from
a
position
of
too
much
humility
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
always
is
with
great
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
may
do
,
if
you
like
,
"
said
Jonas
;
"
you
may
come
and
dine
with
us
at
the
Dragon
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
forced
to
come
down
to
Salisbury
last
night
,
on
some
business
,
and
I
got
him
to
bring
me
over
here
this
morning
,
in
his
carriage
;
at
least
,
not
his
own
carriage
,
for
we
had
a
breakdown
in
the
night
,
but
<EOS>
one
we
hired
instead
<EOS>
;
it
's
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Mind
<EOS>
what
you
're
about
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
not
used
to
all
sorts
;
he
only
mixes
with
the
best
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Some
young
nobleman
who
has
been
borrowing
money
of
you
at
good
interest
,
eh
?
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shaking
his
forefinger
facetiously
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
to
know
the
gay
sprig
.
"
   
"
Borrowing
!
"
echoed
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Borrowing
!
 
<EOS>
When
you
're
a
twentieth
part
as
rich
as
he
is
,
you
may
shut
up
shop
!
 
<EOS>
We
should
be
pretty
well
off
if
we
could
buy
his
furniture
,
and
plate
,
and
pictures
,
by
clubbing
together
.
 
<EOS>
A
likely
man
to
borrow
:
Mr
Montague
!
 
<EOS>
Why
since
I
was
lucky
enough
(
come
!
<EOS>
and
I
'll
say
,
sharp
enough
,
too
)
to
get
a
share
in
the
Assurance
office
that
he
's
President
of
<EOS>
,
I
've
made
---
never
mind
what
I
've
made
,
"
said
Jonas
,
seeming
to
recover
all
at
once
his
usual
caution
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
pretty
well
,
and
I
do
n't
blab
about
such
things
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Ecod
,
I
've
made
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
my
dear
Jonas
,
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
much
warmth
,
"
a
gentleman
like
this
should
receive
some
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Would
he
like
to
see
the
church
?
<EOS>
or
if
he
has
a
taste
for
the
fine
arts
---
which
I
have
no
doubt
he
has
,
from
the
description
you
give
of
his
circumstances
---
I
can
send
him
down
a
few
portfolios
.
 
<EOS>
Salisbury
Cathedral
,
my
dear
Jonas
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
;
the
mention
of
the
portfolios
and
his
anxiety
to
display
himself
to
advantage
,
suggesting
his
usual
phraseology
in
that
regard
,
"
is
an
edifice
replete
with
venerable
associations
,
and
strikingly
suggestive
of
the
loftiest
emotions
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
here
<EOS>
we
contemplate
the
work
of
bygone
ages
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
here
<EOS>
we
listen
to
the
swelling
organ
,
as
we
stroll
through
the
reverberating
aisles
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
drawings
of
this
celebrated
structure
from
the
North
,
from
the
South
,
from
the
East
,
from
the
West
,
from
the
South
-
East
,
from
the
Nor'West
---
"
   
During
this
digression
,
and
indeed
during
the
whole
dialogue
,
Jonas
had
been
rocking
on
his
chair
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
head
thrown
cunningly
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Mr
Pecksniff
now
with
such
shrewd
meaning
twinkling
in
his
eyes
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
stopped
,
and
asked
him
what
he
was
going
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pecksniff
<EOS>
if
I
knew
how
you
meant
to
leave
your
money
,
I
could
put
you
in
the
way
of
doubling
it
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
bad
to
keep
a
chance
like
this
snug
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
But
you
're
such
a
deep
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jonas
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
much
affected
,
"
I
am
not
a
diplomatical
character
;
my
heart
is
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
By
far
the
greater
part
of
the
inconsiderable
savings
I
have
accumulated
in
the
course
of
---
<EOS>
I
hope
---
a
not
dishonourable
or
useless
career
,
is
already
given
,
devised
,
and
bequeathed
(
correct
me
,
my
dear
Jonas
,
if
I
am
technically
wrong
)
,
with
expressions
of
confidence
,
which
I
will
not
repeat
;
and
in
securities
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
mention
to
a
person
whom
I
can
not
,
whom
I
will
not
,
whom
I
need
not
,
name
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
he
gave
the
hand
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
a
fervent
squeeze
,
as
if
he
would
have
added
,
"
God
bless
you
;
be
very
careful
of
it
when
you
get
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jonas
only
shook
his
head
and
laughed
,
and
,
seeming
to
think
better
of
what
he
had
had
in
his
mind
,
said
,
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
keep
his
own
counsel
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
as
he
observed
that
he
would
take
a
walk
,
Mr
Pecksniff
insisted
on
accompanying
him
,
remarking
that
he
could
leave
a
card
for
Mr
Montague
,
as
they
went
along
,
by
way
of
gentleman
-
usher
to
himself
at
dinner
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
Which
he
did
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
their
walk
,
Mr
Jonas
affected
to
maintain
that
close
reserve
which
had
operated
as
a
timely
check
upon
him
during
the
foregoing
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
made
no
attempt
to
conciliate
Mr
Pecksniff
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
was
more
boorish
and
rude
to
him
than
usual
,
that
gentleman
,
so
far
from
suspecting
his
real
design
,
laid
himself
out
to
be
attacked
with
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
knave
to
think
the
tools
with
which
he
works
indispensable
to
knavery
;
and
knowing
what
he
would
do
himself
in
such
a
case
,
Mr
Pecksniff
argued
,
"
if
this
young
man
wanted
anything
of
me
for
his
own
ends
,
he
would
be
polite
and
deferential
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
more
Jonas
repelled
him
in
his
hints
and
inquiries
,
the
more
solicitous
,
therefore
,
Mr
Pecksniff
became
to
be
initiated
into
the
golden
mysteries
at
which
he
had
obscurely
glanced
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
there
be
cold
and
worldly
secrets
,
he
observed
,
between
relations
?
<EOS>
What
was
life
without
confidence
?
 
<EOS>
If
the
chosen
husband
of
his
daughter
,
the
man
to
whom
he
had
delivered
her
with
so
much
pride
and
hope
,
such
bounding
and
such
beaming
joy
;
if
he
were
not
a
green
spot
in
the
barren
waste
of
life
,
where
was
that
oasis
to
be
bound
?
   
<EOS>
Little
<EOS>
did
Mr
Pecksniff
think
on
what
a
very
green
spot
he
planted
one
foot
at
that
moment
!
 
<EOS>
Little
did
he
foresee
when
he
said
,
"
All
is
but
dust
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
very
shortly
he
would
come
down
with
his
own
!
   
<EOS>
Inch
by
inch
,
in
his
grudging
and
ill
-
conditioned
way
;
sustained
to
the
life
,
for
the
hope
of
making
Mr
Pecksniff
suffer
in
that
tender
place
,
the
pocket
,
where
Jonas
smarted
so
terribly
himself
,
gave
him
an
additional
and
malicious
interest
in
the
wiles
he
was
set
on
to
practise
;
inch
by
inch
,
and
bit
by
bit
,
Jonas
rather
allowed
the
dazzling
prospects
of
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
establishment
to
escape
him
,
than
paraded
them
before
his
greedy
listener
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
the
same
niggardly
spirit
,
he
left
Mr
Pecksniff
to
infer
,
if
he
chose
(
which
he
DID
choose
,
of
course
)
,
that
a
consciousness
of
not
having
any
great
natural
gifts
of
speech
and
manner
himself
,
rendered
him
desirous
to
have
the
credit
of
introducing
to
Mr
Montague
<EOS>
some
one
who
was
well
endowed
in
those
respects
,
and
so
atone
for
his
own
deficiencies
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
he
muttered
discontentedly
,
he
would
have
seen
his
beloved
father
-
in
-
law
"
far
enough
off
,
"
before
he
would
have
taken
him
into
his
confidence
.
   
<EOS>
Primed
in
this
artful
manner
,
Mr
Pecksniff
presented
himself
at
dinner
-
time
in
such
a
state
of
suavity
,
benevolence
,
cheerfulness
,
politeness
,
and
cordiality
,
as
even
he
had
perhaps
never
attained
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
frankness
of
the
country
gentleman
,
the
refinement
of
the
artist
,
the
good
-
humoured
allowance
of
the
man
of
the
world
;
philanthropy
,
forbearance
,
piety
,
toleration
,
all
blended
together
in
a
flexible
adaptability
to
anything
and
everything
;
were
expressed
in
Mr
Pecksniff
,
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
great
speculator
and
capitalist
.
   
<EOS>
"
Welcome
,
respected
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
to
our
humble
village
!
<EOS>
We
are
a
simple
people
;
primitive
clods
,
Mr
Montague
;
but
we
can
appreciate
the
honour
of
your
visit
,
as
my
dear
son
-
in
-
law
can
testify
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
strange
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
pressing
his
hand
almost
reverentially
,
"
but
I
seem
to
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
That
towering
forehead
,
my
dear
Jonas
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
aside
,
"
and
those
clustering
masses
of
rich
hair
<EOS>
---
I
must
have
seen
you
,
my
dear
sir
,
in
the
sparkling
throng
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nothing
was
more
probable
,
they
all
agreed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
wished
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
to
have
had
the
honour
of
introducing
you
to
an
elderly
inmate
of
our
house
:
to
the
uncle
of
our
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
sir
,
would
have
been
proud
indeed
to
have
taken
you
by
the
hand
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
gentleman
here
now
?
"
asked
Montague
,
turning
deeply
red
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
said
nothing
about
that
,
Chuzzlewit
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
suppose
you
'd
care
to
hear
of
it
,
"
returned
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
care
to
know
him
,
I
can
promise
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jonas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Jonas
!
"
remonstrated
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Really
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
all
very
well
for
you
to
speak
up
for
him
,
"
said
Jonas
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
nailed
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
get
a
fortune
by
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
 
<EOS>
Is
the
wind
in
that
quarter
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
and
here
they
all
laughed
---
especially
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
"
said
that
gentleman
,
clapping
his
son
-
in
-
law
playfully
upon
the
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
believe
all
that
my
young
relative
says
,
Mr
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
him
in
official
business
,
and
trust
him
in
official
business
,
but
you
must
not
attach
importance
to
his
flights
of
fancy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
,
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
cried
Montague
,
<EOS>
"
I
attach
the
greatest
importance
to
that
last
observation
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
and
hope
it
's
true
.
 
<EOS>
Money
can
not
be
turned
and
turned
again
quickly
enough
in
the
ordinary
course
,
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
like
building
our
fortune
on
the
weaknesses
of
mankind
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
fie
!
<EOS>
oh
fie
,
for
shame
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
all
laughed
again
---
especially
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
honour
that
WE
do
it
,
"
said
Montague
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
fie
,
fie
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
am
sure
you
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
That
I
am
sure
you
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
How
CAN
you
,
you
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
Again
they
all
laughed
in
concert
;
and
again
Mr
Pecksniff
laughed
especially
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
very
agreeable
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
confidential
,
easy
,
straight
-
forward
;
and
still
left
Mr
Pecksniff
in
the
position
of
being
in
a
gentle
way
the
Mentor
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
The
greatest
achievements
in
the
article
of
cookery
that
the
Dragon
had
ever
performed
,
were
set
before
them
;
the
oldest
and
best
wines
in
the
Dragon
's
cellar
saw
the
light
on
that
occasion
;
a
thousand
bubbles
,
indicative
of
the
wealth
and
station
of
Mr
Montague
in
the
depths
of
his
pursuits
,
were
constantly
rising
to
the
surface
of
the
conversation
;
and
they
were
as
frank
and
merry
as
three
honest
men
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
thought
it
a
pity
(
he
said
so
)
that
Mr
Montague
should
think
lightly
of
mankind
and
their
weaknesses
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
anxious
upon
this
subject
;
his
mind
ran
upon
it
;
in
one
way
or
another
he
was
constantly
coming
back
to
it
;
he
must
make
a
convert
of
him
,
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
often
as
Mr
Montague
repeated
his
sentiment
about
building
fortunes
on
the
weaknesses
of
mankind
,
and
added
frankly
,
"
WE
do
it
!
<EOS>
"
just
as
often
Mr
Pecksniff
repeated
"
Oh
fie
!
<EOS>
oh
fie
,
for
shame
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
How
CAN
you
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
laying
a
greater
stress
each
time
on
those
last
words
.
   
<EOS>
The
frequent
repetition
of
this
playful
inquiry
on
the
part
of
Mr
Pecksniff
,
led
at
last
to
playful
answers
on
the
part
of
Mr
Montague
;
but
after
some
little
sharp
-
shooting
on
both
sides
,
Mr
Pecksniff
became
grave
,
almost
to
tears
;
observing
that
if
Mr
Montague
would
give
him
leave
,
he
would
drink
the
health
of
his
young
kinsman
,
Mr
Jonas
;
congratulating
him
upon
the
valuable
and
distinguished
friendship
he
had
formed
,
but
envying
him
,
he
would
confess
,
his
usefulness
to
his
fellow
-
creatures
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
if
he
understood
the
objects
of
that
Institution
with
which
he
was
newly
and
advantageously
connected
---
knowing
them
but
imperfectly
---
they
were
calculated
to
do
Good
;
and
for
his
(
Mr
Pecksniff
's
)
part
,
if
he
could
in
any
way
promote
them
,
he
thought
he
would
be
able
to
lay
his
head
upon
his
pillow
every
night
,
with
an
absolute
certainty
of
going
to
sleep
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
The
transition
from
this
accidental
remark
(
for
it
was
quite
accidental
and
had
fallen
from
Mr
Pecksniff
in
the
openness
of
his
soul
)
,
to
the
discussion
of
the
subject
as
a
matter
of
business
,
was
easy
.
 
<EOS>
Books
,
papers
,
statements
,
tables
,
calculations
of
various
kinds
,
were
soon
spread
out
before
them
;
and
as
they
were
all
framed
with
one
object
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
should
all
have
tended
to
one
end
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
,
whenever
Montague
enlarged
upon
the
profits
of
the
office
,
and
said
that
as
long
as
there
were
gulls
upon
the
wing
it
must
succeed
,
Mr
Pecksniff
mildly
said
"
Oh
fie
!
"
<EOS>
---
 
and
might
indeed
have
remonstrated
with
him
,
but
that
he
knew
he
was
joking
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
did
know
he
was
joking
;
because
he
said
so
.
   
<EOS>
There
never
had
been
before
,
and
there
never
would
be
again
,
such
an
opportunity
for
the
investment
of
a
considerable
sum
(
the
rate
of
advantage
increased
in
proportion
to
the
amount
invested
)
,
as
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
time
that
had
at
all
approached
it
,
was
the
time
when
Jonas
had
come
into
the
concern
;
which
made
him
ill
-
natured
now
,
and
inclined
him
to
pick
out
a
doubt
in
this
place
,
and
a
flaw
in
that
,
and
grumbling
to
advise
Mr
Pecksniff
to
think
better
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
sum
which
would
complete
the
proprietorship
in
this
snug
concern
,
was
nearly
equal
to
Mr
Pecksniff
's
whole
hoard
;
not
counting
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
that
is
to
say
,
whom
he
looked
upon
as
money
in
the
Bank
,
the
possession
of
which
inclined
him
the
more
to
make
a
dash
with
his
own
private
sprats
for
the
capture
of
such
a
whale
as
Mr
Montague
described
.
 
<EOS>
The
returns
began
almost
immediately
,
and
were
immense
.
 
<EOS>
The
end
of
it
was
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
agreed
to
become
the
last
partner
and
proprietor
in
the
Anglo
-
Bengalee
,
and
made
an
appointment
to
dine
with
Mr
Montague
,
at
Salisbury
,
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
then
and
there
to
complete
the
negotiation
.
   
<EOS>
It
took
so
long
to
bring
the
subject
to
this
head
,
that
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
they
parted
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Pecksniff
walked
downstairs
to
the
door
,
he
found
Mrs
Lupin
standing
there
,
looking
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
good
friend
!
"
he
said
;
"
not
a
-
bed
yet
!
 
<EOS>
Contemplating
the
stars
,
Mrs
Lupin
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
beautiful
starlight
night
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
beautiful
starlight
night
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
looking
up
.
<EOS>
"
Behold
the
planets
,
how
they
shine
!
 
<EOS>
Behold
the
---
<EOS>
those
two
persons
who
were
here
this
morning
have
left
your
house
,
I
hope
,
Mrs
Lupin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Behold
the
wonders
of
the
firmament
,
Mrs
Lupin
!
<EOS>
how
glorious
is
the
scene
!
 
<EOS>
When
I
look
up
at
those
shining
orbs
,
I
think
that
each
of
them
is
winking
to
the
other
to
take
notice
of
the
vanity
of
men
's
pursuits
.
 
<EOS>
My
fellowmen
!
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
,
shaking
his
head
in
pity
;
"
you
are
much
mistaken
;
my
wormy
relatives
,
you
are
much
deceived
!
 
<EOS>
The
stars
are
perfectly
contented
(
I
suppose
so
)
in
their
several
spheres
.
<EOS>
Why
are
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
do
not
strive
and
struggle
to
enrich
yourselves
,
or
to
get
the
better
of
each
other
,
my
deluded
friends
,
but
look
up
there
,
with
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
shook
her
head
,
and
heaved
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
affecting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
up
there
,
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Pecksniff
,
stretching
out
his
hand
;
"
With
me
,
a
humble
individual
who
is
also
an
insect
like
yourselves
.
 
<EOS>
Can
silver
,
gold
,
or
precious
stones
,
sparkle
like
those
constellations
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
Then
do
not
thirst
for
silver
,
gold
,
or
precious
stones
;
but
look
up
there
,
with
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
the
good
man
patted
Mrs
Lupin
's
hand
between
his
own
,
as
if
he
would
have
added
"
think
of
this
,
my
good
woman
!
"
and
walked
away
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
or
rapture
,
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
sat
in
the
attitude
in
which
Mr
Pecksniff
had
left
him
,
gazing
moodily
at
his
friend
;
who
,
surrounded
by
a
heap
of
documents
,
was
writing
something
on
an
oblong
slip
of
paper
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
wait
at
Salisbury
over
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
do
you
,
then
?
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
heard
our
appointment
,
"
returned
Montague
,
without
raising
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
any
case
I
should
have
waited
to
see
after
the
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
appeared
to
have
changed
places
again
;
Montague
being
in
high
spirits
;
Jonas
gloomy
and
lowering
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
want
me
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
put
your
name
here
,
"
he
returned
,
glancing
at
him
with
a
smile
,
"
as
soon
as
I
have
filled
up
the
stamp
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
have
your
note
of
hand
for
that
extra
capital
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
I
want
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
to
go
home
,
I
can
manage
Mr
Pecksniff
now
,
alone
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
perfect
understanding
between
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
sat
scowling
at
him
as
he
wrote
,
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
finished
his
writing
,
and
had
dried
it
on
the
blotting
paper
in
his
travelling
-
desk
;
he
looked
up
,
and
tossed
the
pen
towards
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
not
a
day
's
grace
,
not
a
day
's
trust
,
eh
?
"
said
Jonas
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
after
the
pains
I
have
taken
with
to
-
night
's
work
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
night
's
work
was
a
part
of
our
bargain
,
"
replied
Montague
;
"
and
so
was
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
drive
a
hard
bargain
,
"
said
Jonas
,
advancing
to
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
best
.
 
<EOS>
Give
it
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
Montague
gave
him
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
After
pausing
as
if
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
put
his
name
to
it
,
Jonas
dipped
his
pen
hastily
in
the
nearest
inkstand
,
and
began
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
scarcely
marked
the
paper
when
he
started
back
,
in
a
panic
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
devil
's
this
?
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
bloody
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
dipped
the
pen
,
as
another
moment
showed
,
into
red
ink
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
attached
a
strange
degree
of
importance
to
the
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
how
it
had
come
there
,
who
had
brought
it
,
why
it
had
been
brought
;
and
looked
at
Montague
,
at
first
,
as
if
he
thought
he
had
put
a
trick
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
he
used
a
different
pen
,
and
the
right
ink
,
he
made
some
scratches
on
another
paper
first
,
as
half
believing
they
would
turn
red
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
Black
enough
,
this
time
,
"
he
said
,
handing
the
note
to
Montague
.
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
now
!
<EOS>
how
do
you
mean
to
get
away
from
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
cross
early
in
the
morning
to
the
high
road
,
before
you
are
out
of
bed
;
and
catch
the
day
-
coach
,
going
up
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
a
hurry
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
do
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
IN
WHICH
TOM
PINCH
AND
HIS
SISTER
TAKE
A
LITTLE
PLEASURE
;
BUT
QUITE
IN
A
DOMESTIC
WAY
,
<EOS>
AND
WITH
NO
CEREMONY
ABOUT
IT
 
<EOS>
Tom
Pinch
and
his
sister
having
to
part
,
for
the
dispatch
of
the
morning
's
business
,
immediately
after
the
dispersion
of
the
other
actors
in
the
scene
upon
the
wharf
with
which
the
reader
has
been
already
made
acquainted
,
had
no
opportunity
of
discussing
the
subject
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
Tom
,
in
his
solitary
office
,
and
Ruth
,
in
the
triangular
parlour
,
thought
about
nothing
else
all
day
;
and
,
when
their
hour
of
meeting
in
the
afternoon
approached
,
they
were
very
full
of
it
,
to
be
sure
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
plot
between
them
,
that
Tom
should
always
come
out
of
the
Temple
by
one
way
;
and
that
was
past
the
fountain
.
<EOS>
Coming
through
Fountain
Court
,
he
was
just
to
glance
down
the
steps
leading
into
Garden
Court
,
and
to
look
once
all
round
him
;
and
if
Ruth
had
come
to
meet
him
,
there
he
would
see
her
;
not
sauntering
,
you
understand
(
on
account
of
the
clerks
)
,
but
coming
briskly
up
,
with
the
best
little
laugh
upon
her
face
that
ever
played
in
opposition
to
the
fountain
,
and
beat
it
all
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
fifty
to
one
,
Tom
had
been
looking
for
her
in
the
wrong
direction
,
and
had
quite
given
her
up
,
while
she
had
been
tripping
towards
him
from
the
first
;
jingling
that
little
reticule
of
hers
(
with
all
the
keys
in
it
)
to
attract
his
wandering
observation
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
there
was
life
enough
left
in
the
slow
vegetation
of
Fountain
Court
for
the
smoky
shrubs
to
have
any
consciousness
of
the
brightest
and
purest
-
hearted
little
woman
in
the
world
,
is
a
question
for
gardeners
,
and
those
who
are
learned
in
the
loves
of
plants
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
that
it
was
a
good
thing
for
that
same
paved
yard
to
have
such
a
delicate
little
figure
flitting
through
it
;
that
it
passed
like
a
smile
from
the
grimy
old
houses
,
and
the
worn
flagstones
,
and
left
them
duller
,
darker
,
sterner
than
before
;
there
is
no
sort
of
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
The
Temple
fountain
might
have
leaped
up
twenty
feet
to
greet
the
spring
of
hopeful
maidenhood
,
that
in
her
person
stole
on
,
sparkling
,
through
the
dry
and
dusty
channels
of
the
Law
;
the
chirping
sparrows
,
bred
in
Temple
chinks
and
crannies
,
might
have
held
their
peace
to
listen
to
imaginary
skylarks
,
as
so
fresh
a
little
creature
passed
;
<EOS>
the
dingy
boughs
,
unused
to
droop
,
otherwise
than
in
their
puny
growth
,
might
have
bent
down
in
a
kindred
gracefulness
to
shed
their
benedictions
on
her
graceful
head
;
old
love
letters
,
shut
up
in
iron
boxes
in
the
neighbouring
offices
,
and
made
of
no
account
among
the
heaps
of
family
papers
into
which
they
had
strayed
,
and
of
which
,
in
their
degeneracy
,
they
formed
a
part
,
might
have
stirred
and
fluttered
with
a
moment
's
recollection
of
their
ancient
tenderness
,
as
she
went
lightly
by
.
<EOS>
Anything
might
have
happened
that
did
not
happen
,
and
never
will
,
for
the
love
of
Ruth
.
   
<EOS>
Something
happened
,
too
,
upon
the
afternoon
of
which
the
history
treats
.
 
<EOS>
Not
for
her
love
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
quite
by
accident
,
and
without
the
least
reference
to
her
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
Either
she
was
a
little
too
soon
,
or
Tom
was
a
little
too
late
---
she
was
so
precise
in
general
,
that
she
timed
it
to
half
a
minute
---
but
no
Tom
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
But
was
anybody
else
there
,
that
she
blushed
so
deeply
,
after
looking
round
,
and
tripped
off
down
the
steps
with
such
unusual
expedition
?
   
<EOS>
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
that
Mr
Westlock
was
passing
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
The
Temple
is
a
public
thoroughfare
;
they
may
write
up
on
the
gates
that
it
is
not
,
but
so
long
as
the
gates
are
left
open
it
is
,
and
will
be
;
and
Mr
Westlock
had
as
good
a
right
to
be
there
as
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
But
why
did
she
run
away
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
Not
being
ill
dressed
,
for
she
was
much
too
neat
for
that
,
why
did
she
run
away
?
 
<EOS>
The
brown
hair
that
had
fallen
down
beneath
her
bonnet
,
and
had
one
impertinent
imp
of
a
false
flower
clinging
to
it
,
boastful
of
its
licence
before
all
men
<EOS>
,
THAT
could
not
have
been
the
cause
,
for
it
looked
charming
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
foolish
,
panting
<EOS>
,
frightened
little
heart
,
why
did
she
run
away
!
   
<EOS>
Merrily
the
tiny
fountain
played
,
and
merrily
the
dimples
sparkled
on
its
sunny
face
.
 
<EOS>
John
Westlock
hurried
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
Softly
the
whispering
water
broke
and
fell
;
as
roguishly
the
dimples
twinkled
,
as
he
stole
upon
her
footsteps
.
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
foolish
,
panting
<EOS>
,
timid
little
heart
,
why
did
she
feign
to
be
unconscious
of
his
coming
!
 
<EOS>
Why
wish
herself
so
far
away
,
yet
be
so
flutteringly
happy
there
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
felt
sure
it
was
you
,
"
said
John
,
when
he
overtook
her
in
the
sanctuary
of
Garden
Court
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
I
could
n't
be
mistaken
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
SO
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
waiting
for
your
brother
,
"
said
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
bear
you
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
light
was
the
touch
of
the
coy
little
hand
,
that
he
glanced
down
to
assure
himself
he
had
it
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
glance
,
stopping
for
an
instant
at
the
bright
eyes
,
forgot
its
first
design
,
and
went
no
farther
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
up
and
down
three
or
four
times
,
speaking
about
Tom
and
his
mysterious
employment
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
was
a
very
natural
and
innocent
subject
,
surely
.
 
<EOS>
Then
why
,
whenever
Ruth
lifted
up
her
eyes
,
did
she
let
them
fall
again
immediately
,
and
seek
the
uncongenial
pavement
of
the
court
?
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
such
eyes
as
shun
the
light
;
they
were
not
such
eyes
as
require
to
be
hoarded
to
enhance
their
value
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
much
too
precious
and
too
genuine
to
stand
in
need
of
arts
like
those
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
must
have
been
looking
at
them
!
   
<EOS>
They
found
out
Tom
,
though
,
quickly
enough
.
 
<EOS>
This
pair
of
eyes
descried
him
in
the
distance
,
the
moment
he
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
staring
about
him
,
as
usual
,
in
all
directions
but
the
right
one
;
and
was
as
obstinate
in
not
looking
towards
them
,
as
if
he
had
intended
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
plain
that
,
being
left
to
himself
,
he
would
walk
away
home
,
John
Westlock
darted
off
to
stop
him
.
   
<EOS>
This
made
the
approach
of
poor
little
Ruth
,
by
herself
,
one
of
the
most
embarrassing
of
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Tom
,
manifesting
extreme
surprise
(
he
had
no
presence
of
mind
,
that
Tom
,
on
small
occasions
)
;
there
was
John
,
making
as
light
of
it
as
he
could
,
but
explaining
at
the
same
time
with
most
unnecessary
elaboration
;
and
here
was
she
,
coming
towards
them
,
with
both
of
them
looking
at
her
,
conscious
of
blushing
to
a
terrible
extent
,
but
trying
to
throw
up
her
eyebrows
carelessly
,
and
pout
her
rosy
lips
,
as
if
she
were
the
coolest
and
most
unconcerned
of
little
women
.
   
<EOS>
Merrily
the
fountain
plashed
and
plashed
,
until
the
dimples
,
merging
into
one
another
,
swelled
into
a
general
smile
,
that
covered
the
whole
surface
of
the
basin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
an
extraordinary
meeting
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
have
dreamed
of
seeing
you
two
together
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
accidental
,
"
John
was
heard
to
murmur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
cried
Tom
;
"
that
's
what
I
mean
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
was
n't
accidental
,
there
would
be
nothing
remarkable
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
place
for
you
to
have
met
in
,
"
pursued
Tom
,
quite
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
an
unlikely
spot
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
rather
disputed
that
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
considered
it
a
very
likely
spot
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
constantly
passing
to
and
fro
there
,
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
He
should
n't
wonder
if
it
were
to
happen
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
only
wonder
was
,
that
it
had
never
happened
before
.
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
Ruth
had
got
round
on
the
farther
side
of
her
brother
,
and
had
taken
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
squeezing
it
now
,
as
much
as
to
say
"
Are
you
going
to
stop
here
all
day
,
you
dear
,
old
,
blundering
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
answered
the
squeeze
as
if
it
had
been
a
speech
.
 
<EOS>
"
John
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
you
'll
give
my
sister
your
arm
,
we
'll
take
her
between
us
,
and
walk
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
curious
circumstance
to
relate
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Our
meeting
could
not
have
happened
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
Merrily
the
fountain
leaped
and
danced
,
and
merrily
the
smiling
dimples
twinkled
and
expanded
more
and
more
,
until
they
broke
into
a
laugh
against
the
basin
's
rim
,
and
vanished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
said
his
friend
,
as
they
turned
into
the
noisy
street
,
"
I
have
a
proposition
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
that
you
and
your
sister
---
if
she
will
so
far
honour
a
poor
bachelor
's
dwelling
---
give
me
a
great
pleasure
,
and
come
and
dine
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
to
-
day
?
"
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
close
by
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Miss
Pinch
,
insist
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
disinterested
,
for
I
have
nothing
to
give
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
must
not
believe
that
,
Ruth
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
most
tremendous
fellow
,
in
his
housekeeping
,
that
I
ever
heard
of
,
for
a
single
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
Lord
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
Tom
,
"
rejoined
his
dutiful
little
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
mean
,
"
said
Tom
,
regarding
her
with
smiling
admiration
;
"
is
there
anything
you
ought
to
wear
,
and
have
n't
got
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
,
John
;
she
may
not
be
able
to
take
her
bonnet
off
,
for
anything
I
can
tell
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
deal
of
laughing
at
this
,
and
there
were
divers
compliments
from
John
Westlock
---
<EOS>
not
compliments
HE
said
at
least
<EOS>
(
and
really
he
was
right
)
,
but
good
,
plain
,
honest
truths
,
which
no
one
could
deny
.
 
<EOS>
Ruth
laughed
,
and
all
that
,
but
she
made
no
objection
;
so
it
was
an
engagement
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
known
it
a
little
sooner
,
"
said
John
,
"
I
would
have
tried
another
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
Not
in
rivalry
;
but
merely
to
exalt
that
famous
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
on
any
account
have
had
it
made
with
suet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
asked
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
that
cookery
-
book
advises
suet
,
"
said
John
Westlock
;
"
and
ours
was
made
with
flour
and
eggs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
good
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ours
was
made
with
flour
and
eggs
,
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
A
beefsteak
pudding
made
with
flour
and
eggs
!
<EOS>
Why
anybody
knows
better
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
better
than
that
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
Tom
had
been
present
at
the
making
of
the
pudding
,
and
had
been
a
devoted
believer
in
it
all
through
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
so
delighted
to
have
this
joke
against
his
busy
little
sister
and
was
tickled
to
that
degree
at
having
found
her
out
,
that
he
stopped
in
Temple
Bar
to
laugh
;
and
it
was
no
more
to
Tom
,
that
he
was
anathematized
and
knocked
about
by
the
surly
passengers
,
than
it
would
have
been
to
a
post
;
for
he
continued
to
exclaim
with
unabated
good
humour
,
"
flour
and
eggs
!
 
<EOS>
A
beefsteak
pudding
made
with
flour
and
eggs
!
"
<EOS>
until
John
Westlock
and
his
sister
fairly
ran
away
from
him
,
and
left
him
to
have
his
laugh
out
by
himself
;
which
he
had
,
and
then
came
dodging
across
the
crowded
street
to
them
,
with
such
sweet
temper
and
tenderness
(
it
was
quite
a
tender
joke
of
Tom
's
)
beaming
in
his
face
,
God
bless
it
,
that
it
might
have
purified
the
air
,
though
Temple
Bar
had
been
,
as
in
the
golden
days
gone
by
,
embellished
with
a
row
of
rotting
human
heads
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
snug
chambers
in
those
Inns
where
the
bachelors
live
,
and
,
for
the
desolate
fellows
they
pretend
to
be
,
it
is
quite
surprising
how
well
they
get
on
.
 
<EOS>
John
was
very
pathetic
on
the
subject
of
his
dreary
life
,
and
the
deplorable
makeshifts
and
apologetic
contrivances
it
involved
,
but
he
really
seemed
to
make
himself
pretty
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
His
rooms
were
the
perfection
of
neatness
and
convenience
at
any
rate
;
and
if
he
were
anything
but
comfortable
,
the
fault
was
certainly
not
theirs
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
ushered
Tom
and
his
sister
into
his
best
room
<EOS>
(
where
there
was
a
beautiful
little
vase
of
fresh
flowers
on
the
table
,
all
ready
for
Ruth
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
if
he
had
expected
her
,
Tom
said
)
,
than
,
seizing
his
hat
,
he
bustled
out
again
,
in
his
most
energetically
bustling
,
way
;
and
presently
came
hurrying
back
,
as
they
saw
through
the
half
-
opened
door
,
attended
by
a
fiery
-
faced
matron
attired
in
a
crunched
bonnet
,
with
particularly
long
strings
to
it
hanging
down
her
back
;
in
conjunction
with
whom
he
instantly
began
to
lay
the
cloth
for
dinner
,
polishing
up
the
wine
-
glasses
with
his
own
hands
,
brightening
the
silver
top
of
the
pepper
-
caster
on
his
coat
-
sleeve
,
drawing
corks
and
filling
decanters
,
with
a
skill
and
expedition
that
were
quite
dazzling
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
if
,
in
the
course
of
this
rubbing
and
polishing
,
he
had
rubbed
an
enchanted
lamp
or
a
magic
ring
,
obedient
to
which
there
were
twenty
thousand
supernatural
slaves
at
least
,
suddenly
there
appeared
a
being
in
a
white
waistcoat
,
carrying
under
his
arm
a
napkin
,
and
attended
by
another
being
with
an
oblong
box
upon
his
head
,
from
which
a
banquet
,
piping
hot
,
was
taken
out
and
set
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
Salmon
,
lamb
,
peas
,
innocent
young
potatoes
,
a
cool
salad
,
sliced
cucumber
,
a
tender
duckling
,
and
a
tart
---
all
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
came
at
the
right
time
.
 
<EOS>
Where
they
came
from
,
did
n't
appear
;
but
the
oblong
box
was
constantly
going
and
coming
,
and
making
its
arrival
known
to
the
man
in
the
white
waistcoat
by
bumping
modestly
against
the
outside
of
the
door
;
for
,
after
its
first
appearance
,
it
entered
the
room
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
never
surprised
,
this
man
;
he
never
seemed
to
wonder
at
the
extraordinary
things
he
found
in
the
box
,
but
took
them
out
with
a
face
expressive
of
a
steady
purpose
and
impenetrable
character
,
and
put
them
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
kind
man
;
gentle
in
his
manners
,
and
much
interested
in
what
they
ate
and
drank
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
learned
man
,
and
knew
the
flavour
of
John
Westlock
's
private
sauces
,
which
he
softly
and
feelingly
described
,
as
he
handed
the
little
bottles
round
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
grave
man
,
and
a
noiseless
;
for
dinner
being
done
,
and
wine
and
fruit
arranged
upon
the
board
,
he
vanished
,
box
and
all
,
like
something
that
had
never
been
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
say
he
was
a
tremendous
fellow
in
his
housekeeping
?
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
wonderful
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Miss
Pinch
,
"
said
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
bright
side
of
the
life
we
lead
in
such
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
dismal
life
,
indeed
,
if
it
did
n't
brighten
up
to
-
day
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
believe
a
word
he
says
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
lives
here
like
a
monarch
,
and
would
n't
change
his
mode
of
life
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
only
pretends
to
grumble
.
"
   
<EOS>
No
,
John
really
did
not
appear
to
pretend
;
for
he
was
uncommonly
earnest
in
his
desire
to
have
it
understood
that
he
was
as
dull
,
solitary
,
and
uncomfortable
on
ordinary
occasions
as
an
unfortunate
young
man
could
,
in
reason
,
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wretched
life
,
he
said
,
a
miserable
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
getting
rid
of
the
chambers
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
meant
,
in
fact
,
to
put
a
bill
up
very
shortly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
"
said
Tom
Pinch
,
"
I
do
n't
know
where
you
can
go
,
John
,
to
be
more
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
I
can
say
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
YOU
say
,
Ruth
?
"
   
<EOS>
Ruth
trifled
with
the
cherries
on
her
plate
,
and
said
that
she
thought
Mr
Westlock
ought
to
be
quite
happy
,
and
that
she
had
no
doubt
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
Ah
,
foolish
,
panting
,
frightened
little
heart
,
how
timidly
she
said
it
!
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
forgetting
what
you
had
to
tell
,
Tom
;
what
occurred
this
morning
,
"
she
added
in
the
same
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
am
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
so
talkative
on
other
topics
that
I
declare
I
have
not
had
time
to
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
it
you
at
once
,
John
,
in
case
I
should
forget
it
altogether
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
Tom
's
relating
what
had
passed
upon
the
wharf
,
his
friend
was
very
much
surprised
,
and
took
such
a
great
interest
in
the
narrative
as
Tom
could
not
quite
understand
.
 
<EOS>
He
believed
he
knew
the
old
lady
whose
acquaintance
they
had
made
,
he
said
;
and
that
he
might
venture
to
say
,
from
their
description
of
her
,
that
her
name
was
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
what
nature
the
communication
could
have
been
which
Tom
had
borne
so
unexpectedly
<EOS>
;
why
its
delivery
had
been
entrusted
to
him
;
how
it
happened
that
the
parties
were
involved
together
;
and
what
secret
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
affair
;
perplexed
him
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
had
been
sure
of
his
taking
some
interest
in
the
matter
;
but
was
not
prepared
for
the
strong
interest
he
showed
.
 
<EOS>
It
held
John
Westlock
to
the
subject
even
after
Ruth
had
left
the
room
;
and
evidently
made
him
anxious
to
pursue
it
further
than
as
a
mere
subject
of
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
remonstrate
with
my
landlord
,
of
course
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
though
he
is
a
very
singular
secret
sort
of
man
,
and
not
likely
to
afford
me
much
satisfaction
;
even
if
he
knew
what
was
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
you
may
swear
he
did
,
"
John
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
certain
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
shall
remonstrate
with
him
when
I
see
him
(
he
goes
in
and
out
in
a
strange
way
,
but
I
will
try
to
catch
him
tomorrow
morning
)
,
on
his
having
asked
me
to
execute
such
an
unpleasant
commission
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
been
thinking
,
John
,
that
if
I
went
down
to
Mrs
What's
-
her
-
name
's
in
the
City
,
where
I
was
before
,
you
know
---
Mrs
Todgers
's
---
to
-
morrow
morning
,
I
might
find
poor
Mercy
Pecksniff
there
,
perhaps
,
and
be
able
to
explain
to
her
how
I
came
to
have
any
hand
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
perfectly
right
,
Tom
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
after
a
short
interval
of
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
do
better
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
whatever
the
business
is
,
there
is
little
good
in
it
;
and
it
is
so
desirable
for
you
to
disentangle
yourself
from
any
appearance
of
willful
connection
with
it
,
that
I
would
counsel
you
to
see
her
husband
,
if
you
can
,
and
wash
your
hands
of
it
by
a
plain
statement
of
the
facts
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
misgiving
that
there
is
something
dark
at
work
here
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
why
,
at
another
time
;
when
I
have
made
an
inquiry
or
two
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
All
this
sounded
very
mysterious
to
Tom
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
he
knew
he
could
rely
upon
his
friend
,
he
resolved
to
follow
this
advice
.
   
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
to
have
had
a
coat
of
invisibility
,
wherein
to
have
watched
little
Ruth
,
when
she
was
left
to
herself
in
John
Westlock
's
chambers
,
and
John
and
her
brother
were
talking
thus
,
over
their
wine
!
 
<EOS>
The
gentle
way
in
which
she
tried
to
get
up
a
little
conversation
with
the
fiery
-
faced
matron
in
the
crunched
bonnet
,
who
was
waiting
to
attend
her
;
after
making
a
desperate
rally
in
regard
of
her
dress
,
and
attiring
herself
in
a
washed
-
out
yellow
gown
with
sprigs
of
the
same
upon
it
,
so
that
it
looked
like
a
tesselated
work
of
pats
of
butter
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
have
been
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
The
grim
and
griffin
-
like
inflexibility
with
which
the
fiery
-
faced
matron
repelled
these
engaging
advances
,
as
proceeding
from
a
hostile
and
dangerous
power
,
who
could
have
no
business
there
,
unless
it
were
to
deprive
her
of
a
customer
,
or
suggest
what
became
of
the
self
-
consuming
tea
and
sugar
,
and
other
general
trifles
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
have
been
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
The
bashful
,
winning
,
glorious
curiosity
,
with
which
little
Ruth
,
when
fiery
-
face
was
gone
,
peeped
into
the
books
and
nick
-
nacks
that
were
lying
about
,
and
had
a
particular
interest
in
some
delicate
paper
-
matches
on
the
chimney
-
piece
;
wondering
who
could
have
made
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
have
been
worth
seeing
.
 
<EOS>
The
faltering
hand
with
which
she
tied
those
flowers
together
;
with
which
,
almost
blushing
at
her
own
fair
self
as
imaged
in
the
glass
,
she
arranged
them
in
her
breast
,
and
looking
at
them
with
her
head
aside
,
now
half
resolved
to
take
them
out
again
,
now
half
resolved
to
leave
them
where
they
were
.
<EOS>
That
would
have
been
delightful
!
   
<EOS>
John
seemed
to
think
it
all
delightful
;
for
coming
in
with
Tom
to
tea
,
he
took
his
seat
beside
her
like
a
man
enchanted
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
tea
-
service
had
been
removed
,
and
Tom
,
sitting
down
at
the
piano
,
became
absorbed
in
some
of
his
old
organ
tunes
,
he
was
still
beside
her
at
the
open
window
,
looking
out
upon
the
twilight
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
little
enough
to
see
in
Furnival
's
Inn
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
shady
,
quiet
place
,
echoing
to
the
footsteps
of
the
stragglers
who
have
business
there
;
and
rather
monotonous
and
gloomy
on
summer
evenings
.
 
<EOS>
What
gave
it
such
a
charm
to
them
,
that
they
remained
at
the
window
as
unconscious
of
the
flight
of
time
as
Tom
himself
,
the
dreamer
,
while
the
melodies
which
had
so
often
soothed
his
spirit
were
hovering
again
about
him
!
 
<EOS>
What
power
infused
into
the
fading
light
,
the
gathering
darkness
;
the
stars
that
here
and
there
appeared
;
the
evening
air
,
the
City
's
hum
and
stir
,
the
very
chiming
of
the
old
church
clocks
;
such
exquisite
enthrallment
,
that
the
divinest
regions
of
the
earth
spread
out
before
their
eyes
could
not
have
held
them
captive
in
a
stronger
chain
?
   
<EOS>
The
shadows
deepened
,
deepened
,
and
the
room
became
quite
dark
.
<EOS>
Still
Tom
's
fingers
wandered
over
the
keys
of
the
piano
,
and
still
the
window
had
its
pair
of
tenants
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
her
breath
upon
his
forehead
,
roused
Tom
from
his
reverie
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
desisting
with
a
start
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
have
been
very
inconsiderate
and
unpolite
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
little
thought
how
much
consideration
and
politeness
he
had
shown
!
   
<EOS>
"
Sing
something
to
us
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
us
hear
your
voice
.
<EOS>
Come
!
"
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
added
his
entreaties
with
such
earnestness
that
a
flinty
heart
alone
could
have
resisted
them
.
 
<EOS>
Hers
was
not
a
flinty
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
no
!
 
<EOS>
Quite
another
thing
.
   
<EOS>
So
down
she
sat
,
and
in
a
pleasant
voice
began
to
sing
the
ballads
Tom
loved
well
.
 
<EOS>
Old
rhyming
stories
,
with
here
and
there
a
pause
for
a
few
simple
chords
,
such
as
a
harper
might
have
sounded
in
the
ancient
time
while
looking
upward
for
the
current
of
some
half
-
remembered
legend
;
words
of
old
poets
,
wedded
to
such
measures
that
the
strain
of
music
might
have
been
the
poet
's
breath
,
giving
utterance
and
expression
to
his
thoughts
;
and
now
a
melody
so
joyous
and
light
-
hearted
,
that
the
singer
seemed
incapable
of
sadness
,
until
in
her
inconstancy
(
oh
wicked
little
singer
!
)
<EOS>
she
relapsed
,
and
broke
the
listeners
'
hearts
again
;
these
were
the
simple
means
she
used
to
please
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
these
simple
means
prevailed
,
and
she
DID
please
them
,
let
the
still
darkened
chamber
,
and
its
long
-
deferred
illumination
witness
.
   
<EOS>
The
candles
came
at
last
,
and
it
was
time
for
moving
homeward
.
<EOS>
Cutting
paper
carefully
,
and
rolling
it
about
the
stalks
of
those
same
flowers
,
occasioned
some
delay
;
but
even
this
was
done
in
time
,
and
Ruth
was
ready
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
memorable
and
delightful
visit
,
John
!
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
John
thought
he
would
walk
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
!
 
<EOS>
We
can
get
home
very
well
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
think
of
taking
you
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
John
said
he
would
rather
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
you
would
rather
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
only
say
so
out
of
politeness
.
"
   
<EOS>
John
being
quite
sure
,
gave
his
arm
to
Ruth
,
and
led
her
out
.
<EOS>
Fiery
-
face
,
who
was
again
in
attendance
,
acknowledged
her
departure
with
so
cold
a
curtsey
that
it
was
hardly
visible
;
and
cut
Tom
,
dead
.
   
<EOS>
Their
host
was
bent
on
walking
the
whole
distance
,
and
would
not
listen
to
Tom
's
dissuasions
.
 
<EOS>
Happy
time
,
happy
walk
,
happy
parting
,
happy
dreams
!
 
<EOS>
But
there
are
some
sweet
day
-
dreams
,
so
<EOS>
there
are
that
put
the
visions
of
the
night
to
shame
.
   
<EOS>
Busily
the
Temple
fountain
murmured
in
the
moonlight
,
while
Ruth
lay
sleeping
,
with
her
flowers
beside
her
;
and
John
Westlock
sketched
a
portrait
---
whose

---
from
memory

Chapter
46
.
<EOS>
In
which
Miss
Pecksniff
makes
love
,
Mr
Jonas
makes
wrath
,
Mrs
Gamp
makes
tea
,
and
Mr
Chuffey
makes
business
 
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
's
official
duties
coming
to
a
close
,
Tom
hurried
home
without
losing
any
time
by
the
way
;
and
after
dinner
and
a
short
rest
sallied
out
again
,
accompanied
by
Ruth
,
to
pay
his
projected
visit
to
Todgers
's
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
took
Ruth
with
him
,
not
only
because
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
him
to
have
her
for
his
companion
whenever
he
could
,
but
because
he
wished
her
to
cherish
and
comfort
poor
Merry
;
which
she
,
for
her
own
part
(
having
heard
the
wretched
history
of
that
young
wife
from
Tom
)
,
was
all
eagerness
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
so
glad
to
see
me
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
that
I
am
sure
she
will
be
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Your
sympathy
is
certain
to
be
much
more
delicate
and
acceptable
than
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
far
from
being
certain
of
that
,
Tom
,
"
she
replied
;
"
and
indeed
you
do
yourself
an
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
she
may
like
me
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
is
sure
to
do
that
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
confidently
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
number
of
friends
I
should
have
,
if
everybody
was
of
your
way
of
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
Should
n't
I
,
Tom
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
said
his
little
sister
pinching
him
upon
the
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
laughed
,
and
said
that
with
reference
to
this
particular
case
he
had
no
doubt
at
all
of
finding
a
disciple
in
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
you
women
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
<EOS>
you
women
,
my
dear
,
are
so
kind
,
and
in
your
kindness
have
such
nice
perception
;
you
know
<EOS>
so
well
how
to
be
affectionate
and
full
of
solicitude
without
appearing
to
be
<EOS>
;
your
gentleness
of
feeling
is
like
your
touch
so
light
and
easy
,
that
the
one
enables
you
to
deal
with
wounds
of
the
mind
as
tenderly
as
the
other
enables
you
to
deal
with
wounds
of
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
such
---
"
   
"
My
goodness
,
Tom
!
"
<EOS>
his
sister
interposed
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
fall
in
love
immediately
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
put
this
observation
off
good
humouredly
,
but
somewhat
gravely
too
;
and
they
were
soon
very
chatty
again
on
some
other
subject
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
were
passing
through
a
street
in
the
City
,
not
very
far
from
Mrs
Todgers
's
place
of
residence
,
Ruth
checked
Tom
before
the
window
of
a
large
Upholstery
and
Furniture
Warehouse
,
to
call
his
attention
to
something
very
magnificent
and
ingenious
,
displayed
there
to
the
best
advantage
,
for
the
admiration
and
temptation
of
the
public
.
<EOS>
Tom
had
hazarded
some
most
erroneous
and
extravagantly
wrong
guess
in
relation
to
the
price
of
this
article
,
and
had
joined
his
sister
in
laughing
heartily
at
his
mistake
,
when
he
pressed
her
arm
in
his
,
and
pointed
to
two
persons
at
a
little
distance
,
who
were
looking
in
at
the
same
window
with
a
deep
interest
in
the
chests
of
drawers
and
tables
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
Tom
whispered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Pecksniff
,
and
the
young
gentleman
to
whom
she
is
going
to
be
married
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
does
he
look
as
if
he
was
going
to
be
buried
,
Tom
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
his
little
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
is
naturally
a
dismal
young
gentleman
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Tom
"
but
he
is
very
civil
and
inoffensive
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
are
furnishing
their
house
,
"
whispered
Ruth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
suppose
they
are
,
"
replied
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
avoid
speaking
to
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
could
not
very
well
avoid
looking
at
them
,
however
,
especially
as
some
obstruction
on
the
pavement
,
at
a
little
distance
,
happened
to
detain
them
where
they
were
for
a
few
moments
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
had
quite
the
air
of
having
taken
the
unhappy
Moddle
captive
,
and
brought
him
up
to
the
contemplation
of
the
furniture
like
a
lamb
to
the
altar
.
 
<EOS>
He
offered
no
resistance
,
but
was
perfectly
resigned
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
The
melancholy
depicted
in
the
turn
of
his
languishing
head
,
and
in
his
dejected
attitude
,
was
extreme
;
and
though
there
was
a
full
-
sized
four
-
post
bedstead
in
the
window
,
such
a
tear
stood
trembling
in
his
eye
as
seemed
to
blot
it
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Augustus
,
my
love
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
"
ask
the
price
of
the
eight
rosewood
chairs
,
and
the
loo
table
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
are
ordered
already
,
"
said
Augustus
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
are
Another
's
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
can
make
more
like
them
,
if
they
are
,
"
rejoined
Miss
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
they
ca
n't
,
"
said
Moddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
impossible
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
appeared
,
for
the
moment
,
to
be
quite
overwhelmed
and
stupefied
by
the
prospect
of
his
approaching
happiness
;
but
recovering
,
entered
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
He
returned
immediately
,
saying
in
a
tone
of
despair
   
<EOS>
"
Twenty
-
four
pound
ten
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
,
turning
to
receive
this
announcement
,
became
conscious
of
the
observation
of
Tom
Pinch
and
his
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
really
!
"
cried
Miss
Pecksniff
,
glancing
about
her
,
as
if
for
some
convenient
means
of
sinking
into
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
---
 
there
never
was
such
a
---
to
think
that
one
should
be
so
very
---
<EOS>
Mr
Augustus
Moddle
,
Miss
Pinch
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
was
quite
gracious
to
Miss
Pinch
in
this
triumphant
introduction
;
exceedingly
gracious
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
more
than
gracious
;
she
was
kind
and
cordial
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
recollection
of
the
old
service
Tom
had
rendered
her
in
knocking
Mr
Jonas
on
the
head
had
wrought
this
change
in
her
opinions
;
or
whether
her
separation
from
her
parent
had
reconciled
her
to
all
human
-
kind
,
or
to
all
that
interesting
portion
of
human
-
kind
which
was
not
friendly
to
him
;
or
whether
the
delight
of
having
some
new
female
acquaintance
to
whom
to
communicate
her
interesting
prospects
was
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
;
cordial
and
kind
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
twice
Miss
Pecksniff
kissed
Miss
Pinch
upon
the
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
"
Augustus
---
Mr
Pinch
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
!
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
aside
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
so
ashamed
in
my
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ruth
begged
her
not
to
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mind
your
brother
less
than
anybody
else
,
"
simpered
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
indelicacy
of
meeting
any
gentleman
under
such
circumstances
!
 
<EOS>
Augustus
,
my
child
,
did
you
---
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Miss
Pecksniff
whispered
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
The
suffering
Moddle
repeated
:
   
"
Twenty
-
four
pound
ten
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
silly
man
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
them
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
speaking
of
the
---
"
   
Here
she
whispered
him
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
the
same
patterned
chintz
as
that
in
the
window
;
thirty
-
two
,
twelve
,
six
,
"
said
Moddle
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
very
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
stopped
him
from
giving
any
further
explanation
by
laying
her
hand
upon
his
lips
,
and
betraying
a
soft
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
She
then
asked
Tom
Pinch
which
way
he
was
going
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
see
if
I
could
find
your
sister
,
"
answered
Tom
,
"
to
whom
I
wished
to
say
a
few
words
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
going
to
Mrs
Todgers
's
,
where
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
your
going
on
,
then
,
"
said
Cherry
,
"
for
we
have
not
long
left
there
;
and
<EOS>
I
know
she
is
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
take
you
to
my
sister
's
house
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Augustus
---
<EOS>
Mr
Moddle
,
I
mean
---
 
and
myself
,
are
on
our
way
to
tea
there
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
think
of
HIM
,
"
she
added
,
nodding
her
head
as
she
observed
some
hesitation
on
Tom
's
part
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
at
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
?
"
asked
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
am
quite
sure
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
any
MORE
revenge
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
expressively
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
really
,
I
must
beg
you
two
gentlemen
to
walk
on
,
and
allow
me
to
follow
with
Miss
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
never
was
so
taken
by
surprise
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
furtherance
of
this
bashful
arrangement
,
Moddle
gave
his
arm
to
Tom
;
and
Miss
Pecksniff
linked
her
own
in
Ruth
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
,
my
love
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
"
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
disguise
,
after
what
you
have
seen
,
that
I
am
about
to
be
united
to
the
gentleman
who
is
walking
with
your
brother
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
in
vain
to
conceal
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
let
me
have
your
candid
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ruth
intimated
that
,
as
far
as
she
could
judge
,
he
was
a
very
eligible
swain
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
curious
to
know
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
with
loquacious
frankness
,
"
whether
you
have
observed
,
or
fancied
,
in
this
very
short
space
of
time
,
that
he
is
of
a
rather
melancholy
turn
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
very
short
a
time
,
"
Ruth
pleaded
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
<EOS>
;
but
do
n't
let
that
interfere
with
your
answer
,
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
curious
to
hear
what
you
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ruth
acknowledged
that
he
had
impressed
her
at
first
sight
as
looking
"
rather
low
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
really
?
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
that
is
quite
remarkable
!
<EOS>
Everybody
says
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
says
the
same
;
and
Augustus
informs
me
that
it
is
quite
a
joke
among
the
gentlemen
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
but
for
the
positive
commands
I
have
laid
upon
him
,
I
believe
it
would
have
been
the
occasion
of
loaded
fire
-
arms
being
resorted
to
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
is
the
cause
of
his
appearance
of
depression
?
"
   
<EOS>
Ruth
thought
of
several
things
;
such
as
his
digestion
,
his
tailor
,
his
mother
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
But
hesitating
to
give
utterance
to
any
one
of
them
,
she
refrained
from
expressing
an
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
;
"
I
should
n't
wish
it
to
be
known
,
but
I
do
n't
mind
mentioning
it
to
you
,
having
known
your
brother
for
so
many
years
<EOS>
---
I
refused
Augustus
three
times
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
of
a
most
amiable
and
sensitive
nature
,
always
ready
to
shed
tears
if
you
look
at
him
,
which
is
extremely
charming
;
and
he
has
never
recovered
the
effect
of
that
cruelty
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
WAS
cruel
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
with
a
self
-
conviction
candour
that
might
have
adorned
the
diadem
of
her
own
papa
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
doubt
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
back
upon
my
conduct
now
with
blushes
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
liked
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
that
he
was
not
to
me
what
the
crowd
of
young
men
who
had
made
proposals
had
been
,
but
something
very
different
.
 
<EOS>
Then
what
right
had
I
to
refuse
him
three
times
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
severe
trial
of
his
fidelity
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
Ruth
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
But
such
is
the
caprice
and
thoughtlessness
of
our
sex
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
be
a
warning
to
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
try
the
feelings
of
any
one
who
makes
you
an
offer
,
as
I
have
tried
the
feelings
of
Augustus
;
but
if
you
ever
feel
towards
a
person
as
I
really
felt
towards
him
,
at
the
very
time
when
I
was
driving
him
to
distraction
,
let
that
feeling
find
expression
,
if
that
person
throws
himself
at
your
feet
,
as
Augustus
Moddle
did
at
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Think
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
"
what
my
feelings
would
have
been
,
if
I
had
goaded
him
to
suicide
,
and
it
had
got
into
the
papers
!
"
   
<EOS>
Ruth
observed
that
she
would
have
been
full
of
remorse
,
no
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Remorse
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Pecksniff
,
in
a
sort
of
snug
and
comfortable
penitence
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
my
remorse
is
at
this
moment
,
even
after
making
reparation
by
accepting
him
,
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
you
!
<EOS>
Looking
back
upon
my
giddy
self
,
my
dear
,
now
that
I
am
sobered
down
and
made
thoughtful
,
by
treading
on
the
very
brink
of
matrimony
;
and
contemplating
myself
as
I
was
when
I
was
like
what
you
are
now
;
I
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
I
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
consequence
of
my
past
conduct
?
<EOS>
Until
Augustus
leads
me
to
the
altar
he
is
not
sure
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
blighted
and
withered
the
affections
of
his
heart
to
that
extent
that
he
is
not
sure
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
that
preying
on
his
mind
and
feeding
on
his
vitals
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
the
reproaches
of
my
conscience
,
when
I
see
this
in
the
man
I
love
!
"
   
<EOS>
Ruth
endeavoured
to
express
some
sense
of
her
unbounded
and
flattering
confidence
;
and
presumed
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
soon
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
soon
indeed
,
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
our
house
is
ready
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
furnishing
now
as
fast
as
we
can
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
same
vein
of
confidence
Miss
Pecksniff
ran
through
a
general
inventory
of
the
articles
that
were
already
bought
with
the
articles
that
remained
to
be
purchased
;
what
garments
she
intended
to
be
married
in
,
and
where
the
ceremony
was
to
be
performed
;
and
gave
Miss
Pinch
,
in
short
(
as
she
told
her
)
,
early
and
exclusive
information
on
all
points
of
interest
connected
with
the
event
.
   
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
forward
in
the
rear
,
Tom
and
Mr
Moddle
walked
on
,
arm
in
arm
,
in
the
front
,
in
a
state
of
profound
silence
,
which
Tom
at
last
broke
;
after
thinking
for
a
long
time
what
he
could
say
that
should
refer
to
an
indifferent
topic
,
in
respect
of
which
he
might
rely
,
with
some
degree
of
certainty
,
on
Mr
Moddle
's
bosom
being
unruffled
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
that
in
these
crowded
streets
the
foot
-
passengers
are
not
oftener
run
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Moddle
,
with
a
dark
look
,
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
The
drivers
wo
n't
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
Tom
began
---
    
"
That
there
are
some
men
,
"
interrupted
Moddle
,
with
a
hollow
laugh
,
"
who
ca
n't
get
run
over
.
 
<EOS>
They
live
a
charmed
life
.
 
<EOS>
Coal
waggons
recoil
from
them
,
and
even
cabs
refuse
to
run
them
down
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Augustus
,
marking
Tom
's
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
such
men
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
'em
is
a
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
"
thought
Tom
,
"
this
young
gentleman
is
in
a
state
of
mind
which
is
very
serious
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
Abandoning
all
idea
of
conversation
,
he
did
not
venture
to
say
another
word
,
but
he
was
careful
to
keep
a
tight
hold
upon
Augustus
's
arm
,
lest
he
should
fly
into
the
road
,
and
making
another
and
a
more
successful
attempt
,
should
get
up
a
private
little
Juggernaut
before
the
eyes
of
his
betrothed
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
was
so
afraid
of
his
committing
this
rash
act
,
that
he
had
scarcely
ever
experienced
such
mental
relief
as
when
they
arrived
in
safety
at
Mrs
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
's
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
Walk
up
,
pray
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
For
Tom
halted
,
irresolutely
,
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
doubtful
whether
I
should
be
welcome
,
"
replied
Tom
,
"
or
,
<EOS>
I
ought
rather
to
say
,
I
have
no
doubt
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
up
a
message
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
nonsense
that
is
!
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
,
speaking
apart
to
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
at
home
,
I
am
certain
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
is
not
;
and
<EOS>
Merry
has
n't
the
least
idea
that
you
ever
---
"
   
"
No
,
"
interrupted
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
would
I
have
her
know
it
,
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
proud
of
that
scuffle
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
then
you
are
so
modest
,
you
see
,
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
pray
walk
up
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
wish
her
to
know
it
,
and
do
wish
to
speak
to
her
,
pray
walk
up
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
walk
up
,
Miss
Pinch
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
stand
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
still
hesitated
for
<EOS>
he
felt
that
he
was
in
an
awkward
position
.
<EOS>
But
Cherry
passing
him
at
this
juncture
,
and
leading
his
sister
upstairs
,
and
the
house
-
door
being
at
the
same
time
shut
behind
them
,
he
followed
without
quite
knowing
whether
it
was
well
or
ill
-
judged
so
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
Merry
,
my
darling
!
"
said
the
fair
Miss
Pecksniff
,
opening
the
door
of
the
usual
sitting
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
are
Mr
Pinch
and
his
sister
come
to
see
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
we
should
find
you
here
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs
Gamp
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
do
,
<EOS>
Mr
Chuffey
,
though
it
's
of
no
use
asking
you
the
question
,
I
am
well
aware
.
"
   
<EOS>
Honouring
each
of
these
parties
,
as
she
severally
addressed
them
,
with
an
acid
smile
,
Miss
Charity
presented
"
Mr
Moddle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
have
seen
HIM
before
,
"
she
pleasantly
observed
.
<EOS>
"
Augustus
,
my
sweet
child
,
bring
me
a
chair
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
sweet
child
did
as
he
was
told
;
and
was
then
about
to
retire
into
a
corner
to
mourn
in
secret
,
when
Miss
Charity
,
calling
him
in
an
audible
whisper
a
"
little
pet
,
"
gave
him
leave
to
come
and
sit
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
hoped
,
for
the
general
cheerfulness
of
mankind
,
that
such
a
doleful
little
pet
was
never
seen
as
Mr
Moddle
looked
when
he
complied
.
 
<EOS>
So
despondent
was
his
temper
,
that
he
showed
no
outward
thrill
of
ecstasy
when
Miss
Pecksniff
placed
her
lily
hand
in
his
,
and
concealed
this
mark
of
her
favour
from
the
vulgar
gaze
by
covering
it
with
a
corner
of
her
shawl
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
was
infinitely
more
rueful
then
than
he
had
been
before
;
and
,
sitting
uncomfortably
upright
in
his
chair
,
surveyed
the
company
with
watery
eyes
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
without
the
aid
of
language
,
"
Oh
,
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
<EOS>
some
kind
Christian
help
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
the
ecstasies
of
Mrs
Gamp
were
sufficient
to
have
furnished
forth
a
score
of
young
lovers
;
and
they
were
chiefly
awakened
by
the
sight
of
Tom
Pinch
and
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
was
a
lady
of
that
happy
temperament
which
can
be
ecstatic
without
any
other
stimulating
cause
than
a
general
desire
to
establish
a
large
and
profitable
connection
.
 
<EOS>
She
added
daily
so
many
strings
to
her
bow
,
that
she
made
a
perfect
harp
of
it
;
and
upon
that
instrument
she
now
began
to
perform
an
extemporaneous
concerto
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
goodness
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
Mrs
Chuzzlewit
!
 
<EOS>
To
think
as
I

may
make
so
bold

so
plain

plain
enough

look
through
millstones

Mrs

,
to
find
out

<EOS>
Which
no

ladies

none

To

as
I
should
see
that
smilinest
and
sweetest
face
which
me
and
another
friend
of
mine
,
took
notice
of
among
the
packages
down
London
Bridge
,
in
this
promiscous
place

is
a
surprige
in

deed

"
   
<EOS>
Having
contrived
,
in
this
happy
manner
,
to
invest
every
member
of
her
audience
with
an
individual
share
and
immediate
personal
interest
in
her
address
,
Mrs
Gamp
dropped
several
curtseys
to
Ruth
,
and
smilingly
shaking
her
head
a
great
many
times
,
pursued
the
thread
of
her
discourse
:
   
<EOS>
"
Now

when
in

has
his

I

<EOS>
Harris
had

done
afore

she
says
,
"
and
wore
it

till
the

run

when
the
money
was
declined
to

back

no

be

But

never

"
 
<EOS>
If

said
Mrs
Gamp
,
looking
round
,
and
chuckling
as
she
dropped
a
general
curtsey
,
"

<EOS>
With
these
words
the
worthy
woman
,
who
appeared
to
have
dropped
in
to
take
tea
as
a
delicate
little
attention
,
rather
than
to
have
any
engagement
on
the
premises
in
an
official
capacity
,
crossed
to
Mr
Chuffey
,
who
was
seated
in
the

corner
as
of
old
,
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rouge

said
Mrs

<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry

cried
the
old
man
,
looking
humbly
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

I

in

I

Where

<EOS>
Merry
went
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah

said
the
old

,
patting
her
on
the

She

<EOS>
Poor

<EOS>
As
she
took
her
seat
upon
a
low
chair
by
the
old
man
's
side
,
and
put
herself
within
the
reach
of
his
hand
,
she
looked
up
once
at
Tom

<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
look

cast
upon

there

a
faint
smile
trembling
on

It

look

Tom

You

misery

changed
me

Never

It

said
Mrs
Gamp
,
contemplating
him
from
a
little
distance
with
anything
but
favour
,
as
he
continued
to
mutter
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
that
you
do
n't
know
wot
you
say
,
for
you
'd
tire
your
own
patience
out
if
you
did
,
and
fret
yourself
into
a
happy
releage
for
all
<EOS>

knows
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
His
son
,
"
murmured
the
old
man
,
lifting
up
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
son
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
sure
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
you
're
a

settlin

of

Mr
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
To
your
satigefaction
,
sir
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
would
n't
lay
a
new
pincushion
on

myself
,

though
you
ARE
so
well
informed

Suppose
you

to
favour
us
with
some
remarks
on
twins
,
sir
,
WOULD
you
be
so
good
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
bitter
and
indignant
sarcasm
which
Mrs
Gamp
conveyed
into
these
taunts
was
altogether
lost
on
the
unconscious
Chuffey
,
who
appeared
to
be
as
little
cognizant
of
their
delivery
as
of
his
having
given
Mrs
Gamp
offence
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
high
-
minded
woman
being
sensitively
alive
to
any
invasion
of
her
professional
province
,
and
imagining
that
Mr
Chuffey
had
given
utterance
to
some
prediction
on
the
subject
of
sons
,
which
ought
to
have
emanated
in
the
first
instance
from
herself
as
the
only
lawful
authority
,
or
which
should
at
least
have
been
on
no
account
proclaimed
without
her
sanction
and
concurrence
,
was
not
so
easily
appeased
.
 
<EOS>
She
continued
to
sidle
at
Mr
Chuffey
with
looks
of
sharp
hostility
,
and
to
defy
him
with
many
other
ironical
remarks
,
uttered
in
that
low
key
which
commonly
denotes
suppressed
indignation
;
until
the
entrance
of
the
teaboard
,
and
a
request
from
Mrs
Jonas
that
she
would
make
tea
at
a
side
-
table
for
the
party
that
had
unexpectedly
assembled
,
restored
her
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
smiled
again
,
and
entered
on
her
ministration
with
her
own
particular
urbanity
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
quite
a
family
it
is
to
make
tea
for
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
;
"
and
wot
a
happiness

it

Gamp
himself

Mrs

at
one
blow

being
in

,
struck
out

<EOS>
As
the
privileges
of
the
side
-
table
---
besides
including
the
small
prerogatives
of
sitting
next
the
toast
,
and
taking
two
cups
of
tea
to
other
people
's
one
,
and
always
taking
them
at
a
crisis
,
that
is
to
say
,
before
putting
fresh
water
into
the
tea
-
pot
,
and
after
it
had
been
standing
for
some
time
---
also
comprehended
a
full
view
of
the
company
,
and
an
opportunity
of
addressing
them
as
from
a
rostrum
,
Mrs
Gamp
discharged
the
functions
entrusted
to
her
with
extreme
good
-
humour
and
affability
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
resting
her
saucer
on
the
palm
of
her
outspread
hand
,
and
supporting
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
she
stopped
between
her
sips
of
tea
to
favour
the
circle
with
a
smile
,
a
wink
,
a
roll
of
the
head
,
or
some
other
mark
of
notice
;
and
at
those
periods
her
countenance
was
lighted
up
with
a
degree
of
intelligence
and
vivacity
,
which
it
was
almost
impossible
to
separate
from
the
benignant
influence
of
distilled
waters
.
   
<EOS>
But
for
Mrs
Gamp
,
it
would
have
been
a
curiously
silent
party
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
only
spoke
to
her
Augustus
,
and
to
him
in
whispers
.
<EOS>
Augustus
spoke
to
nobody
,
but
sighed
for
every
one
,
and
occasionally
gave
himself
such
a
sounding
slap
upon
the
forehead
as
would
make
Mrs
Todgers
,
who
was
rather
nervous
,
start
in
her
chair
with
an
involuntary
exclamation
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
was
occupied
in
knitting
,
and
seldom
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Merry
held
the
hand
of
cheerful
little
Ruth
between
her
own
,
and
listening
with
evident
pleasure
to
all
she
said
,
but
rarely
speaking
herself
,
sometimes
smiled
,
and
sometimes
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
,
and
sometimes
turned
aside
to
hide
the
tears
that
trembled
in
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
felt
this
change
in
her
so
much
,
and
was
so
glad
to
see
how
tenderly
Ruth
dealt
with
her
,
and
how
she
knew
and
answered
to
it
,
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
make
any
movement
towards
their
departure
,
although
he
had
long
since
given
utterance
to
all
he
came
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
clerk
,
subsiding
into
his
usual
state
,
remained
profoundly
silent
,
while
the
rest
of
the
little
assembly
were
thus
occupied
,
intent
upon
the
dreams
,
whatever
they
might
be
,
which
hardly
seemed
to
stir
the
surface
of
his
sluggish
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
The
bent
of
these
dull
fancies
combining
probably
with
the
silent
feasting
that
was
going
on
about
him
,
and
some
struggling
recollection
of
the
last
approach
to
revelry
he
had
witnessed
,
suggested
a
strange
question
to
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
round
upon
a
sudden
,
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
lying
dead
upstairs
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
,
"
said
Merry
,
turning
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
here
!
"
cried
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
here
!
 
<EOS>
Where
is
he
then
---
my
old
master
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
who
had
the
only
son
?
 
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
 
Hush
!
"
said
Merry
,
speaking
kindly
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
happened
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
recollect
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Recollect
!
"
rejoined
the
old
man
,
with
a
cry
of
grief
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
if
I
could
forget
!
 
<EOS>
As
if
I
ever
could
forget
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
up
to
his
face
for
a
moment
;
and
then
repeated
turning
round
exactly
as
before
:
   
"
Who
's
lying
dead
upstairs
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
!
"
said
Merry
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
he
gazed
angrily
upon
her
,
as
upon
a
stranger
who
endeavoured
to
deceive
him
;
but
peering
into
her
face
,
and
seeing
that
it
was
indeed
she
<EOS>
,
he
shook
his
head
in
sorrowful
compassion
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
do
n't
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
They
do
n't
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Who
are
these
,
and
why
are
they
merry
-
making
here
,
if
there
is
no
one
dead
?
 
<EOS>
Foul
play
!
 
<EOS>
Go
see
who
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
made
a
sign
to
them
not
to
speak
to
him
,
which
indeed
they
had
little
inclination
to
do
;
and
remained
silent
herself
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
he
for
a
short
time
;
but
then
he
repeated
the
same
question
with
an
eagerness
that
had
a
peculiar
terror
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
some
one
dead
,
"
he
said
,
"
or
dying
;
and
I
want
to
knows
who
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Go
see
,
go
see
!
 
<EOS>
Where
's
Jonas
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
country
,
"
she
replied
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
gazed
at
her
as
if
he
doubted
what
she
said
,
or
had
not
heard
her
;
and
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
walked
across
the
room
and
upstairs
,
whispering
as
he
went
,
"
Foul
play
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
heard
his
footsteps
overhead
,
going
up
into
that
corner
of
the
room
in
which
the
bed
stood
<EOS>
(
it
was
there
old
Anthony
had
died
)
;
and
then
they
heard
him
coming
down
again
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
His
fancy
was
not
so
strong
or
wild
that
it
pictured
to
him
anything
in
the
deserted
bedchamber
which
was
not
there
;
for
he
returned
much
calmer
,
and
appeared
to
have
satisfied
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
tell
you
,
"
he
said
to
Merry
in
his
quavering
voice
,
as
he
sat
down
again
,
and
patted
her
upon
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
tell
me
either
;
but
I
'll
watch
,
I
'll
watch
.
 
<EOS>
They
shall
not
hurt
you
;
do
n't
be
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
have
sat
up
watching
,
I
have
sat
up
watching
too
.
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
,
I
have
!
"
<EOS>
he
piped
out
,
clenching
his
weak
,
shrivelled
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Many
a
night
I
have
been
ready
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
this
with
such
trembling
gaps
and
pauses
in
his
want
of
breath
,
and
said
it
in
his
jealous
secrecy
so
closely
in
her
ear
,
that
little
or
nothing
of
it
was
understood
by
the
visitors
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
had
heard
and
seen
enough
of
the
old
man
to
be
disquieted
,
and
to
have
left
their
seats
and
gathered
about
him
;
thereby
affording
Mrs
Gamp
,
whose
professional
coolness
was
not
so
easily
disturbed
,
an
eligible
opportunity
for
concentrating
the
whole
resources
of
her
powerful
mind
and
appetite
upon
the
toast
and
butter
,
tea
and
eggs
.
<EOS>
She
had
brought
them
to
bear
upon
those
viands
with
such
vigour
that
her
face
was
in
the
highest
state
of
inflammation
,
when
she
now
(
there
being
nothing
left
to
eat
or
drink
)
saw
fit
to
interpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
highty
tighty
,
sir
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
is
these
your
manners
?
<EOS>
You
want
a
pitcher
of
cold
water
throw'd
over
you
to
bring
you
round
;
that
's
my
belief
,
and
if
you
was
under
Betsey
Prig
you
'd
have
it
,
too
<EOS>
,
I
do
assure
you
,
Mr
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
Spanish
Flies
is
the
only
thing
to
draw
this
nonsense
out
of
you
;
and
if
anybody
wanted
to
do
you
a
kindness
,
they
'd
clap
a
blister
of
'em
on
your
head
,
and
put
a
mustard
poultige
on
your
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
dead
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
no
grievous
loss
if
some
one
was
,
I
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
quiet
now
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
said
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
disturb
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
bother
the
old
wictim
,
Mrs
Chuzzlewit
,
"
replied
that
zealous
lady
,
"
I
ai
n't
no
patience
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
give
him
his
own
way
too
much
by
half
.
 
<EOS>
A
worritin
'
wexagious
creetur
!
"
   
<EOS>
No
doubt
with
the
view
of
carrying
out
the
precepts
she
enforced
,
and
"
bothering
the
old
wictim
"
in
practice
as
well
as
in
theory
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Gamp
took
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
,
and
gave
him
some
dozen
or
two
of
hearty
shakes
backward
and
forward
in
his
chair
;
that
exercise
being
considered
by
the
disciples
of
the
Prig
school
of
nursing
(
who
are
very
numerous
among
professional
ladies
)
as
exceedingly
conducive
to
repose
,
and
highly
beneficial
to
the
performance
of
the
nervous
functions
.
 
<EOS>
Its
effect
in
this
instance
was
to
render
the
patient
so
giddy
and
addle
-
headed
,
that
he
could
say
nothing
more
;
which
Mrs
Gamp
regarded
as
the
triumph
of
her
art
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
she
said
,
loosening
the
old
man
's
cravat
,
in
consequence
of
his
being
rather
black
in
the
face
,
after
this
scientific
treatment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
I
hope
,
you
're
easy
in
your
mind
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
turn
at
all
faint
we
can
soon
rewive
you
,
sir
,
I
promige
you
.
 
<EOS>
Bite
a
person
's
thumbs
,
or
turn
their
fingers
the
wrong
way
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
smiling
with
the
consciousness
of
at
once
imparting
pleasure
and
instruction
to
her
auditors
,
"
and
they
comes
to
,
wonderful
,
Lord
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
this
excellent
woman
had
been
formerly
entrusted
with
the
care
of
Mr
Chuffey
on
a
previous
occasion
,
neither
Mrs
Jonas
nor
anybody
else
had
the
resolution
to
interfere
directly
with
her
mode
of
treatment
;
though
all
present
(
Tom
Pinch
and
his
sister
especially
)
appeared
to
be
disposed
to
differ
from
her
views
.
 
<EOS>
For
such
is
the
rash
boldness
of
the
uninitiated
,
that
they
will
frequently
set
up
some
monstrous
abstract
principle
,
such
as
humanity
,
or
tenderness
,
or
the
like
idle
folly
,
in
obstinate
defiance
of
all
precedent
and
usage
;
and
will
even
venture
to
maintain
the
same
against
the
persons
who
have
made
the
precedents
and
established
the
usage
,
and
who
must
therefore
be
the
best
and
most
impartial
judges
of
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr
Pinch
!
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
all

unfortunate
marriage

If
my

,
"
said
Cherry
,
raising
her
voice
a
little
;
"
for
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
add
to
the
uneasiness
of
any
person
;
far
less
of
my
own
sister
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
a
sister
's
duties
are
,
Mr
Pinch
,
and
<EOS>
I
hope
I
always
showed
it
in
my
practice
.
 
<EOS>
Augustus
,
my
dear
child
,
find
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
give
it
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Augustus
obeyed
,
and
took
Mrs
Todgers
aside
to
pour
his
griefs
into
her
friendly
bosom
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
Mr
Pinch
,
"
said
Charity
,
looking
after
her
betrothed
and
glancing
at
her
sister
,
"
that
I
ought
to
be
very
grateful
for
the
blessings
I
enjoy
,
and
those
which
are
yet
in
store
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
contrast
Augustus
"
---
here
she
was
modest
and
embarrased
---
"
<EOS>
who
,
I
do
n't
mind
saying
to
you
,
is
all
softness
,
mildness
,
and
devotion
,
with
the
detestable
man
who
is
my
sister
's
husband
;
and
when
I
think
,
Mr
Pinch
,
that
in
the
dispensations
of
this
world
,
our
cases
might
have
been
reversed
;
I
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
,
indeed
,
and
much
to
make
me
humble
and
contented
.
"
   
<EOS>
Contented
she
might
have
been
,
but
humble
she
assuredly
was
not
.
<EOS>
Her
face
and
manner
experienced
something
so
widely
different
from
humility
,
that
Tom
could
not
help
understanding
and
despising
the
base
motives
that
were
working
in
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
away
,
and
said
to
Ruth
,
that
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
your
husband
,
"
said
Tom
to
Merry
,
"
and
explain
to
him
,
as
I
would
have
done
if
I
had
met
him
here
,
that
if
he
has
sustained
any
inconvenience
through
my
means
,
it
is
not
my
fault
;
a
postman
not
being
more
innocent
of
the
news
he
brings
,
than
I
was
when
I
handed
him
that
letter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Merry
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
do
some
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
parted
tenderly
from
Ruth
,
who
with
her
brother
was
in
the
act
of
leaving
the
room
,
when
a
key
was
heard
in
the
lock
of
the
door
below
,
and
immediately
afterwards
a
quick
footstep
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Tom
stopped
,
and
looked
at
Merry
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
Jonas
,
she
said
timidly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
better
not
meet
him
on
the
stairs
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Tom
,
drawing
his
sister
's
arm
through
his
,
and
coming
back
a
step
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
wait
for
him
here
,
a
moment
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
said
it
when
the
door
opened
,
and
Jonas
entered
.
<EOS>
His
wife
came
forward
to
receive
him
;
but
he
put
her
aside
with
his
hand
,
and
said
in
a
surly
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
you
'd
got
a
party
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
looked
,
at
the
same
time
,
either
by
accident
or
design
,
towards
Miss
Pecksniff
;
and
as
Miss
Pecksniff
was
only
too
delighted
to
quarrel
with
him
,
she
instantly
resented
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
let
us
intrude
upon
your
domestic
happiness
!
 
<EOS>
That
would
be
a
pity
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
taken
tea
here
,
sir
,
in
your
absence
;
but
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
send
us
a
note
of
the
expense
,
receipted
,
we
shall
be
happy
to
pay
it
.
<EOS>
Augustus
,
my
love
,
we
will
go
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
,
unless
you
wish
to
remain
here
,
we
shall
be
happy
to
take
you
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
pity
,
indeed
,
to
spoil
the
bliss
which
this
gentleman
always
brings
with
him
,
especially
into
his
own
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Charity
!
 
<EOS>
Charity
!
<EOS>
"
remonstrated
her
sister
,
in
such
a
heartfelt
tone
that
she
might
have
been
imploring
her
to
show
the
cardinal
virtue
whose
name
she
bore
.
   
<EOS>
"
Merry
,
my
dear
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
advice
,
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
,
with
a
stately
scorn
---
by
the
way
,
she
had
not
been
offered
any
---
"
<EOS>
but
I
am
not
his
slave
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
nor
would
n't
have
been
if
you
could
,
"
interrupted
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
WHAT
did
you
say
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Miss
Pecksniff
,
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
hear
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Jonas
,
lounging
down
upon
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
-
going
to
say
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
like
to
stay
,
you
may
stay
.
<EOS>
If
you
like
to
go
,
you
may
go
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
stay
,
please
to
be
civil
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beast
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Pecksniff
,
sweeping
past
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Augustus
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
beneath
your
notice
!
"
 
<EOS>
Augustus
had
been
making
some
faint
and
sickly
demonstration
of
shaking
his
fist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
away
,
child
,
"
screamed
Miss
Pecksniff
,
"
I
command
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
scream
was
elicited
from
her
by
Augustus
manifesting
an
intention
to
return
and
grapple
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
Miss
Pecksniff
giving
the
fiery
youth
a
pull
,
and
Mrs
Todgers
giving
him
a
push
they
all
three
tumbled
out
of
the
room
together
,
to
the
music
of
Miss
Pecksniff
's
shrill
remonstrances
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
Jonas
had
seen
nothing
of
Tom
and
his
sister
;
for
they
were
almost
behind
the
door
when
he
opened
it
,
and
he
had
sat
down
with
his
back
towards
them
,
and
had
purposely
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
during
his
altercation
with
Miss
Pecksniff
,
in
order
that
his
seeming
carelessness
might
increase
the
exasperation
of
that
wronged
young
damsel
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
now
faltered
out
that
Tom
had
been
waiting
to
see
him
;
and
Tom
advanced
.
   
<EOS>
The
instant
he
presented
himself
,
Jonas
got
up
from
his
chair
,
and
swearing
a
great
oath
,
caught
it
in
his
grasp
,
as
if
he
would
have
felled
Tom
to
the
ground
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
most
unquestionably
would
have
done
,
but
that
his
very
passion
and
surprise
made
him
irresolute
,
and
gave
Tom
,
in
his
calmness
,
an
opportunity
of
being
heard
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
cause
to
be
violent
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Though
what
I
wish
to
say
relates
to
your
own
affairs
,
I
know
nothing
of
them
,
and
desire
to
know
nothing
of
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
was
too
enraged
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
the
door
open
;
and
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
ground
,
motioned
Tom
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
you
can
not
suppose
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
that
I
am
here
with
any
view
of
conciliating
you
or
pleasing
myself
,
I
am
quite
indifferent
to
your
reception
of
me
,
or
your
dismissal
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
what
I
have
to
say
,
if
you
are
not
a
madman
!
 
<EOS>
I
gave
you
a
letter
the
other
day
,
when
you
were
about
to
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
Thief
,
you
did
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pay
you
for
the
carriage
of
it
one
day
,
and
settle
an
old
score
besides
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
you
need
n't
waste
words
or
threats
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
to
understand
---
plainly
because
I
would
rather
keep
clear
of
you
and
everything
that
concerns
you
:
not
because
I
have
the
least
apprehension
of
your
doing
me
any
injury
:
which
would
be
weak
indeed
---
that
I
am
no
party
to
the
contents
of
that
letter
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
know
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
was
not
even
aware
that
it
was
to
be
delivered
to
you
;
and
that
I
had
it
from
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
By
the
Lord
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
fiercely
catching
up
the
chair
<EOS>
,
"
I
'll
knock
your
brains
out
,
if
you
speak
another
word
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
,
nevertheless
,
persisting
in
his
intention
,
and
opening
his
lips
to
speak
again
,
Jonas
set
upon
him
like
a
savage
;
and
in
the
quickness
and
ferocity
of
his
attack
would
have
surely
done
him
some
grievous
injury
,
defenceless
as
he
was
,
and
embarrassed
by
having
his
frightened
sister
clinging
to
his
arm
,
if
Merry
had
not
run
between
them
,
crying
to
Tom
for
the
love
of
Heaven
to
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
agony
of
this
poor
creature
,
the
terror
of
his
sister
,
the
impossibility
of
making
himself
audible
,
and
the
equal
impossibility
of
bearing
up
against
Mrs
Gamp
,
who
threw
herself
upon
him
like
a
feather
-
bed
,
and
forced
him
backwards
down
the
stairs
by
the
mere
oppression
of
her
dead
weight
,
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
shook
the
dust
of
that
house
off
his
feet
,
without
having
mentioned
Nadgett
's
name
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
name
could
have
passed
his
lips
;
if
Jonas
,
in
the
insolence
of
his
vile
nature
,
had
never
roused
him
to
do
that
old
act
of
manliness
,
for
which
(
and
not
for
his
last
offence
)
<EOS>
he
hated
him
with
such
malignity
;
if
Jonas
could
have
learned
,
as
then
he
could
and
would
have
learned
,
through
Tom
's
means
,
what
unsuspected
spy
there
was
upon
him
;
he
would
have
been
saved
from
the
commission
of
a
Guilty
Deed
,
then
drawing
on
towards
its
black
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
But
the
fatality
was
of
his
own
working
;
the
pit
was
of
his
own
digging
;
the
gloom
that
gathered
round
him
was
the
shadow
of
his
own
life
.
   
<EOS>
His
wife
had
closed
the
door
,
and
thrown
herself
before
it
,
on
the
ground
,
upon
her
knees
.
 
<EOS>
She
held
up
her
hands
to
him
now
,
and
besought
him
not
to
be
harsh
with
her
,
for
she
had
interposed
in
fear
of
bloodshed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
so
!
"
said
Jonas
,
looking
down
upon
her
,
as
he
fetched
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
are
your
friends
,
are
they
,
when
I
am
away
?
 
<EOS>
You
plot
and
tamper
with
this
sort
of
people
,
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
knowledge
of
these
secrets
,
and
no
clue
to
their
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
seen
him
since
I
left
home
<EOS>
but
once
---
 
but
twice
---
before
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
sneered
Jonas
,
catching
at
this
correction
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
once
,
but
twice
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Which
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Twice
and
once
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
Three
times
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
more
,
you
lying
jade
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
made
an
angry
motion
with
his
hand
,
she
shrunk
down
hastily
.
<EOS>
A
suggestive
action
!
 
<EOS>
Full
of
a
cruel
truth
!
   
<EOS>
"
How
many
more
times
?
"
he
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
morning
,
and
to
-
day
,
and
once
besides
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
retort
upon
her
,
when
the
clock
struck
.
 
<EOS>
He
started
stopped
,
and
listened
;
appearing
to
revert
to
some
engagement
,
or
to
some
other
subject
,
a
secret
within
his
own
breast
,
recalled
to
him
by
this
record
of
the
progress
of
the
hours
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
lie
there
!
 
<EOS>
Get
up
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
helped
her
to
rise
,
or
rather
hauled
her
up
by
the
arm
,
he
went
on
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
young
lady
;
and
do
n't
whine
when
you
have
no
occasion
,
or
I
may
make
some
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
find
him
in
my
house
again
,
or
find
that
you
have
seen
him
in
anybody
else
's
house
,
you
'll
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
not
deaf
and
dumb
to
everything
that
concerns
me
,
unless
you
have
my
leave
to
hear
and
speak
,
you
'll
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
obey
exactly
what
I
order
,
you
'll
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
attend
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
time
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
struck
eight
a
minute
ago
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
towards
her
intently
;
and
said
,
with
a
laboured
distinctness
,
as
if
he
had
got
the
words
off
by
heart
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
travelling
day
and
night
,
and
am
tired
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lost
some
money
,
and
that
do
n't
improve
me
.
 
<EOS>
Put
my
supper
in
the
little
off
-
room
below
,
and
have
the
truckle
-
bed
made
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
sleep
there
to
-
night
,
and
maybe
to
-
morrow
night
;
and
if
I
can
sleep
all
day
to
-
morrow
,
so
much
the
better
,
for
I
've
got
trouble
to
sleep
off
,
if
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
the
house
quiet
,
and
do
n't
call
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mind
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
call
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
anybody
call
me
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
lie
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
it
should
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
Was
that
all
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
what
?
 
<EOS>
You
must
be
prying
and
questioning
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
angrily
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
more
do
you
want
to
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
nothing
,
Jonas
,
but
what
you
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
All
hope
of
confidence
between
us
has
long
deserted
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
,
I
should
hope
so
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
if
you
will
tell
me
what
you
wish
,
I
will
be
obedient
and
will
try
to
please
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
merit
of
that
,
for
I
have
no
friend
in
my
father
or
my
sister
,
but
am
quite
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
humble
and
submissive
.
 
<EOS>
You
told
me
you
would
break
my
spirit
,
and
you
have
done
so
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
break
my
heart
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
ventured
,
as
she
said
these
words
,
to
lay
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
He
suffered
it
to
rest
there
,
in
his
exultation
;
and
the
whole
mean
,
abject
,
sordid
,
pitiful
soul
of
the
man
,
looked
at
her
,
for
the
moment
,
through
his
wicked
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
moment
only
;
for
,
with
the
same
hurried
return
to
something
within
himself
,
he
bade
her
,
in
a
surly
tone
,
show
her
obedience
by
executing
his
commands
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
withdrawn
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
several
times
;
but
always
with
his
right
hand
clenched
,
as
if
it
held
something
;
which
it
did
not
,
being
empty
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
tired
of
this
,
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
thoughtfully
turned
up
the
sleeve
of
his
right
arm
,
as
if
he
were
rather
musing
about
its
strength
than
examining
it
;
but
,
even
then
,
he
kept
the
hand
clenched
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
brooding
in
this
chair
,
with
his
eyes
cast
down
upon
the
ground
,
when
Mrs
Gamp
came
in
to
tell
him
that
the
little
room
was
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Not
being
quite
sure
of
her
reception
after
interfering
in
the
quarrel
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
as
a
means
of
interesting
and
propitiating
her
patron
,
affected
a
deep
solicitude
in
Mr
Chuffey
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
he
now
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
cried
Jonas
,
raising
his
head
,
and
staring
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
matron
with
a
smile
and
a
curtsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
thinking
of
!
 
<EOS>
You
was
n't
here
,
sir

when
he
was
took
so
strange
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
poor
dear
creetur
took
so
strange
in
all
my
life
,
except
a
patient
much
about
the
same
age
,
as
I
once
nussed
,
which
his
calling
was
the
custom-'us
,
and
his
name
was
Mrs
Harris
's
own
father
,
as
pleasant
a
singer
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
as
ever
you
heerd
,
with
a
voice
like
a
Jew's
-
harp
in
the
bass
notes
,
that
it
took
six
men
to
hold
at
sech
times
,
foaming
frightful
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Chuffey
,
eh
?
"
said
Jonas
carelessly
,
seeing
that
she
went
up
to
the
old
,
clerk
,
and
looked
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
   
"
The
creetur
's
head
's
so
hot
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
that
you
might
heat
a
flat
-
iron
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
no
wonder
I
am
sure
<EOS>
,
considerin
'
the
things
he
said
!
"
   
"
Said
!
"
cried
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
laid
her
hand
upon
her
heart
,
to
put
some
check
upon
its
palpitations
,
and
turning
up
her
eyes
replied
in
a
faint
voice
:
   
"
<EOS>
The
awfulest
things
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
as
ever
I
heerd
!
 
<EOS>
Which
Mrs
Harris
's
father
never
spoke
a
word
when
took
so
,
<EOS>
some
does
and
some
do
n't
,
except
sayin
'
<EOS>
when
he
come
round
,
"
Where
is
Sairey
Gamp
?
"
<EOS>
But
raly
,
sir
,
when
Mr
Chuffey
comes
to
ask
who
's
lyin
'
dead
upstairs
,
and
---
"
   
"
Who
's
lying
dead
upstairs
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Jonas
,
standing
aghast
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
nodded
,
made
as
if
she
were
swallowing
,
and
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
lying
dead
upstairs
;
sech
was
his
Bible
language
;
and
where
was
Mr
Chuzzlewit
as
had
the
only
son
;
and
when
he
goes
upstairs
a
-
looking
in
the
beds
and
wandering
about
the
rooms
,
and
comes
down
again
a
-
whisperin
'
softly
to
his

self
about
foul
play

that
;
it
gives
me
sech
<EOS>
a
turn
,
I
do
n't
deny
it
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
that
I
never
could
have
kep
myself
up
but
for
a
little
drain
o
'
spirits

which
I
seldom
touches

could
always

to

<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
old
fool
's
mad

"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
much
disturbed
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
opinion
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
and
I
will
not
deceive
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
as
Mr
Chuffey
,
sir
,
rekwires
attention
(
if
I
may
make
so
bold
)
,
and
should
not
have
his
liberty

wex
and
worrit
your

as

does
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
<EOS>
who
minds
what
he
says
?
"
retorted
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Still
he
is
worritin
'
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
do
n't
mind
him
,
but
he
IS
a
ill
conwenience
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ecod
<EOS>
you
're
right
,
"
said
Jonas
,
looking
doubtfully
at
the
subject
of
this
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
half
a
mind
to
shut
him
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
rubbed
her
hands
,
and
smiled
,
and
shook
her
head
,
and
sniffed
expressively
,
as
scenting
a
job
.
   
<EOS>
"
Could
you
---
could
you
take
care
of
such
an
idiot
,
now
,
in
some
spare
room
upstairs
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
and
a
friend
of
mine
,
one
off
,
one
on
,
could
do
it
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
replied
the
nurse
;
"
our
charges
not
bein
'
high
,
but
wishin
'
they
was
lower
,
and
allowance
made
considerin
'
not
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
Me
and
Betsey
Prig
,
sir
,
would
undertake
Mr
Chuffey
reasonable
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
looking
at
him
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
piece
of
goods
,
for
which
she
was
driving
a
bargain
;
"
and
give
every
satigefaction
.
 
<EOS>
Betsey
Prig
has
nussed
a
many
lunacies
,
and
well
she
knows
their
ways
,
<EOS>
which
puttin
'
'em
right
close
<EOS>
afore
<EOS>
the
fire
,
when
fractious
,
is
the
certainest
and
most
compoging
.
"
   
<EOS>
While
Mrs
Gamp
discoursed
to
this
effect
,
Jonas
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
again
,
glancing
covertly
at
the
old
clerk
,
as
he
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
made
a
stop
,
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
look
after
him
,
I
suppose
,
or
I
may
have
him
doing
some
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
What
say
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothin'
more
likely
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
well
I
have
experienged
,
I
do
assure
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Look
after
him
for
the
present
,
and
---
let
me
see
---
three
days
from
this
time
let
the
other
woman
come
here
,
and
we
'll
see
if
we
can
make
a
bargain
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
About
nine
or
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
say
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
eye
upon
him
in
the
meanwhile
,
and
do
n't
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
mad
as
a
March
hare
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madder
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
deal
madder
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
See
to
him
,
then
;
take
care
that
he
does
no
harm
;
and
recollect
what
I
have
told
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Leaving
Mrs
Gamp
in
the
act
of
repeating
all
she
had
been
told
,
and
of
producing
in
support
of
her
memory
and
trustworthiness
,
many
commendations
selected
from
among
the
most
remarkable
opinions
of
the
celebrated
Mrs
Harris
,
he
descended
to
the
little
room
prepared
for
him
,
and
pulling
off
his
coat
and
his
boots
,
put
them
outside
the
door
before
he
locked
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
locking
it
,
he
was
careful
so
to
adjust
the
key
as
to
baffle
any
curious
person
who
might
try
to
peep
in
through
the
key
-
hole
;
and
when
he
had
taken
these
precautions
,
he
sat
down
to
his
supper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Chuff
,
"
he
muttered
,
"
it
'll
be
pretty
easy
to
be
even
with
YOU
.
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
use
doing
things
by
halves
,
and
as
long
as
I
stop
here
,
I
'll
take
good
care
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
'm
off
you
may
say
what
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
d####d
strange
thing
,
"
he
added
,
pushing
away
his
untouched
plate
,
and
striding
moodily
to
and
fro
,
"
that
his
drivellings
should
have
taken
this
turn
just
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
pacing
the
little
room
from
end
to
end
several
times
,
he
sat
down
in
another
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
just
now
,
but
for
anything
I
know
,
he
may
have
been
carrying
on
the
same
game
all
along
.
 
<EOS>
Old
dog
!
 
<EOS>
He
shall
be
gagged
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
paced
the
room
again
in
the
same
restless
and
unsteady
way
;
and
then
sat
down
upon
the
bedstead
,
leaning
his
chin
upon
his
hand
,
and
looking
at
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
looked
at
it
for
a
long
time
,
he
remembered
his
supper
;
and
resuming
the
chair
he
had
first
occupied
,
began
to
eat
with
great
rapacity
;
not
like
a
hungry
man
,
but
as
if
he
were
determined
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
drank
too
,
roundly
;
sometimes
stopping
in
the
middle
of
a
draught
to
walk
,
and
change
his
seat
and
walk
again
,
and
dart
back
to
the
table
and
fall
to
,
in
a
ravenous
hurry
,
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
now
growing
dark
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
gloom
of
evening
,
deepening
into
night
,
came
on
,
another
dark
shade
emerging
from
within
him
seemed
to
overspread
his
face
,
and
slowly
change
it
.
 
<EOS>
Slowly
,
slowly
;
darker
and
darker
;
more
and
more
haggard
;
creeping
over
him
by
little
and
little
,
until
it
was
black
night
within
him
and
without
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
he
had
shut
himself
up
,
was
on
the
ground
floor
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
lighted
by
a
dirty
skylight
,
and
had
a
door
in
the
wall
,
opening
into
a
narrow
covered
passage
or
blind
-
alley
,
very
little
frequented
after
five
or
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
and
not
in
much
use
as
a
thoroughfare
at
any
hour
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
had
an
outlet
in
a
neighbouring
street
.
   
<EOS>
The
ground
on
which
this
chamber
stood
had
,
at
one
time
,
not
within
his
recollection
,
been
a
yard
;
and
had
been
converted
to
its
present
purpose
for
use
as
an
office
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
occasion
for
it
died
with
the
man
who
built
it
;
and
saving
that
it
had
sometimes
served
as
an
apology
for
a
spare
bedroom
,
and
that
the
old
clerk
had
once
held
it
(
but
that
was
years
ago
)
as
his
recognized
apartment
,
it
had
been
little
troubled
by
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
and
Son
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
blotched
,
stained
,
mouldering
room
,
like
a
vault
;
and
there
were
water
-
pipes
running
through
it
,
<EOS>
which
at
unexpected
times
in
the
night
,
when
other
things
were
quiet
,
clicked
and
gurgled
suddenly
,
as
if
they
were
choking
.
   
<EOS>
The
door
into
the
court
had
not
been
open
for
a
long
,
long
time
;
but
the
key
had
always
hung
in
one
place
,
and
there
it
hung
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
prepared
for
its
being
rusty
;
for
he
had
a
little
bottle
of
oil
in
his
pocket
and
the
feather
of
a
pen
,
with
which
he
lubricated
the
key
and
the
lock
too
,
carefully
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
while
he
had
been
without
his
coat
,
and
had
nothing
on
his
feet
but
his
stockings
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
got
softly
into
bed
in
the
same
state
,
and
tossed
from
side
to
side
to
tumble
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
restless
condition
that
was
easily
done
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
arose
,
he
took
from
his
portmanteau
,
which
he
had
caused
to
be
carried
into
that
place
when
he
came
home
,
a
pair
of
clumsy
shoes
,
and
put
them
on
his
feet
;
also
a
pair
of
leather
leggings
,
such
as
countrymen
are
used
to
wear
,
with
straps
to
fasten
them
to
the
waistband
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
he
dressed
himself
at
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
Lastly
,
he
took
out
a
common
frock
of
coarse
dark
jean
,
which
he
drew
over
his
own
under
-
clothing
;
and
a
felt
hat
---
he
had
purposely
left
his
own
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
sat
himself
down
by
the
door
,
with
the
key
in
his
hand
,
waiting
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
no
light
;
the
time
was
dreary
,
long
,
and
awful
.
 
<EOS>
The
ringers
were
practicing
in
a
neighbouring
church
,
and
the
clashing
of
the
bells
was
almost
maddening
.
 
<EOS>
Curse
the
clamouring
bells
,
they
seemed
to
know
that
he
was
listening
at
the
door
,
and
to
proclaim
it
in
a
crowd
of
voices
to
all
the
town
!
 
<EOS>
Would
they
never
be
still
?
   
<EOS>
They
ceased
at
last
,
and
then
the
silence
was
so
new
and
terrible
that
it
seemed
the
prelude
to
some
dreadful
noise
.
 
<EOS>
Footsteps
in
the
court
!
 
<EOS>
Two
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
back
from
the
door
on
tiptoe
,
as
if
they
could
have
seen
him
through
its
wooden
panels
.
   
<EOS>
They
passed
on
,
talking
(
he
could
make
out
)
about
a
skeleton
which
had
been
dug
up
yesterday
,
in
some
work
of
excavation
near
at
hand
,
and
was
supposed
to
be
that
of
a
murdered
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
murder
is
not
always
found
out
,
you
see
,
"
they
said
to
one
another
as
they
turned
the
corner
.
   
<EOS>
Hush
!
   
<EOS>
He
put
the
key
into
the
lock
,
and
turned
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
resisted
for
a
while
,
but
soon
came
stiffly
open
;
mingling
with
the
sense
of
fever
in
his
mouth
,
a
taste
of
rust
,
and
dust
,
and
earth
,
and
rotting
wood
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
out
;
passed
out
;
locked
it
after
him
.
   
<EOS>
All
was
clear
and
quiet
,
as
he
fled
away
.

Chapter
47
.
<EOS>
Conclusion
of
the
enterprise
of
Mr
Jonas
and
his
friend
 
<EOS>
Did
no
men
passing
through
the
dim
streets
shrink
without
knowing
why
,
when
he
came
stealing
up
behind
them
?
 
<EOS>
As
he
glided
on
,
had
no
child
in
its
sleep
an
indistinct
perception
of
a
guilty
shadow
falling
on
its
bed
,
that
troubled
its
innocent
rest
?
 
<EOS>
Did
no
dog
howl
,
and
strive
to
break
its
rattling
chain
,
that
it
might
tear
him
;
no
burrowing
rat
,
scenting
the
work
he
had
in
hand
,
essay
to
gnaw
a
passage
after
him
,
that
it
might
hold
a
greedy
revel
at
the
feast
of
his
providing
?
 
<EOS>
When
he
looked
back
,
across
his
shoulder
,
was
it
to
see
if
his
quick
footsteps
still
fell
dry
upon
the
dusty
pavement
,
or
were
already
moist
and
clogged
with
the
red
mire
that
stained
the
naked
feet
of
Cain
!
   
<EOS>
He
shaped
his
course
for
the
main
western
road
,
and
soon
reached
it
;
riding
a
part
of
the
way
,
then
alighting
and
walking
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
travelled
for
a
considerable
distance
upon
the
roof
of
a
stage
-
coach
,
which
came
up
while
he
was
afoot
;
and
when
it
turned
out
of
his
road
,
bribed
the
driver
of
a
return
post
-
chaise
to
take
him
on
with
him
;
and
then
made
across
the
country
at
a
run
,
and
saved
a
mile
or
two
before
he
struck
again
into
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
as
his
plan
was
,
he
came
up
with
a
certain
lumbering
,
slow
,
night
-
coach
,
which
stopped
wherever
it
could
,
and
was
stopping
then
at
a
public
-
house
,
while
the
guard
and
coachman
ate
and
drank
within
.
   
<EOS>
He
bargained
for
a
seat
outside
this
coach
,
and
took
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
quitted
it
no
more
until
it
was
within
a
few
miles
of
its
destination
,
but
occupied
the
same
place
all
night
.
   
<EOS>
All
night
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
common
fancy
that
nature
seems
to
sleep
by
night
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
false
fancy
,
as
who
should
know
better
than
he
?
   
<EOS>
The
fishes
slumbered
in
the
cold
,
bright
,
glistening
streams
and
rivers
,
perhaps
;
and
the
birds
roosted
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
;
and
in
their
stalls
and
pastures
beasts
were
quiet
;
and
human
creatures
slept
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
of
that
,
when
the
solemn
night
was
watching
,
when
it
never
winked
,
when
its
darkness
watched
no
less
than
its
light
!
 
<EOS>
The
stately
trees
,
the
moon
and
shining
stars
,
the
softly
stirring
wind
,
the
over
-
shadowed
lane
,
the
broad
,
bright
countryside
<EOS>
,
they
all
kept
watch
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
blade
of
growing
grass
or
corn
,
but
watched
;
and
the
quieter
it
was
,
the
more
intent
and
fixed
its
watch
upon
him
seemed
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
And
yet
he
slept
.
 
<EOS>
Riding
on
among
those
sentinels
of
God
,
he
slept
,
and
did
not
change
the
purpose
of
his
journey
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
forgot
it
in
his
troubled
dreams
,
it
came
up
steadily
,
and
woke
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
never
woke
him
to
remorse
,
or
to
abandonment
of
his
design
.
   
<EOS>
He
dreamed
at
one
time
that
he
was
lying
calmly
in
his
bed
,
thinking
of
a
moonlight
night
and
the
noise
of
wheels
,
when
the
old
clerk
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
,
and
beckoned
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
signal
he
arose
immediately
---
being
already
dressed
in
the
clothes
he
actually
wore
at
that
time
---
and
accompanied
him
into
a
strange
city
,
where
the
names
of
the
streets
were
written
on
the
walls
in
characters
quite
new
to
him
;
which
gave
him
no
surprise
or
uneasiness
,
for
he
remembered
in
his
dream
to
have
been
there
before
.
 
<EOS>
Although
these
streets
were
very
precipitous
,
insomuch
that
to
get
from
one
to
another
<EOS>
it
was
necessary
to
descend
great
heights
by
ladders
that
were
too
short
,
and
ropes
that
moved
deep
bells
,
and
swung
and
swayed
as
they
were
clung
to
,
the
danger
gave
him
little
emotion
beyond
the
first
thrill
of
terror
;
his
anxieties
being
concentrated
on
his
dress
which
was
quite
unfitted
for
some
festival
that
was
about
to
be
holden
there
,
and
in
which
he
had
come
to
take
a
part
.
<EOS>
Already
,
great
crowds
began
to
fill
the
streets
,
and
in
one
direction
myriads
of
people
came
rushing
down
an
interminable
perspective
,
strewing
flowers
and
making
way
for
others
on
white
horses
,
when
a
terrible
figure
started
from
the
throng
,
and
cried
out
that
it
was
the
Last
Day
for
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
The
cry
being
spread
,
there
was
a
wild
hurrying
on
to
Judgment
;
and
the
press
became
so
great
that
he
and
his
companion
(
who
was
constantly
changing
,
and
was
never
the
same
man
two
minutes
together
,
though
he
never
saw
one
man
come
or
another
go
)
,
stood
aside
in
a
porch
,
fearfully
surveying
the
multitude
;
in
which
there
were
many
faces
that
he
knew
,
and
many
that
he
did
not
know
,
but
dreamed
he
did
;
when
all
at
once
a
struggling
head
rose
up
among
the
rest
---
livid
and
deadly
,
but
the
same
as
he
had
known
it
---
and
denounced
him
as
having
appointed
that
direful
day
to
happen
.
 
<EOS>
They
closed
together
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
strove
to
free
the
hand
in
which
he
held
a
club
,
and
strike
the
blow
he
had
so
often
thought
of
,
he
started
to
the
knowledge
of
his
waking
purpose
and
the
rising
of
the
sun
.
   
<EOS>
The
sun
was
welcome
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
life
and
motion
,
and
a
world
astir
,
to
divide
the
attention
of
Day
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
eye
of
Night
---
of
wakeful
,
watchful
,
silent
,
and
attentive
Night
,
with
so
much
leisure
for
the
observation
of
his
wicked
thoughts
---
that
he
dreaded
most
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
glare
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Glory
shows
to
small
advantage
in
the
night
,
upon
a
crowded
battle
-
field
.
 
<EOS>
How
then
shows
Glory
's
blood
-
relation
,
bastard
Murder
!
   
<EOS>
Aye
!
 
<EOS>
He
made
no
compromise
,
and
held
no
secret
with
himself
now
.
<EOS>
Murder
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
get
down
here
<EOS>
"
he
said
   
"
Short
of
the
town
,
eh
!
"
<EOS>
observed
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
may
get
down
<EOS>
where
I
please
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
got
up
to
please
yourself
,
and
may
get
down
to
please
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
break
our
hearts
to
lose
you
,
and
it
would
n't
have
broken
'em
if
we
'd
never
found
you
.
 
<EOS>
Be
a
little
quicker
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
guard
had
alighted
,
and
was
waiting
in
the
road
to
take
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
jealousy
and
distrust
of
what
he
contemplated
,
he
thought
this
man
looked
at
him
with
more
than
common
curiosity
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
staring
at
?
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
a
handsome
man
,
"
returned
the
guard
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
want
your
fortune
told
,
I
'll
tell
you
a
bit
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
be
drowned
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
consolation
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Before
he
could
retort
or
turn
away
,
the
coachman
put
an
end
to
the
dialogue
by
giving
him
a
cut
with
his
whip
,
and
biddig
him
get
out
for
a
surly
dog
.
 
<EOS>
The
guard
jumped
up
to
his
seat
at
the
same
moment
,
and
they
drove
off
,
laughing
;
leaving
him
to
stand
in
the
road
and
shake
his
fist
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
displeased
though
,
on
second
thoughts
,
to
have
been
taken
for
an
ill
-
conditioned
common
country
fellow
;
but
rather
congratulated
himself
upon
it
as
a
proof
that
he
was
well
disguised
.
   
<EOS>
Wandering
into
a
copse
by
the
road
-
side
---
but
not
in
that
place
;
two
or
three
miles
off
---
he
tore
out
from
a
fence
a
thick
,
hard
,
knotted
stake
;
and
,
sitting
down
beneath
a
hayrick
,
spent
some
time
in
shaping
it
,
in
peeling
off
the
bark
,
and
fashioning
its
jagged
head
with
his
knife
.
   
<EOS>
The
day
passed
on
.
 
<EOS>
Noon
,
afternoon
,
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Sunset
.
   
<EOS>
At
that
serene
and
peaceful
time
two
men
,
riding
in
a
gig
,
came
out
of
the
city
by
a
road
not
much
frequented
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
day
on
which
Mr
Pecksniff
had
agreed
to
dine
with
Montague
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
kept
his
appointment
,
and
was
now
going
home
.
 
<EOS>
His
host
was
riding
with
him
for
a
short
distance
;
meaning
to
return
by
a
pleasant
track
,
which
Mr
Pecksniff
had
engaged
to
show
him
,
through
some
fields
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
knew
their
plans
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
hung
about
the
inn
-
yard
while
they
were
at
dinner
and
had
heard
their
orders
given
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
loud
and
merry
in
their
conversation
,
and
might
have
been
heard
at
some
distance
;
far
above
the
sound
of
their
carriage
wheels
or
horses
'
hoofs
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
on
noisily
,
to
where
a
stile
and
footpath
indicated
their
point
of
separation
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
too
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Much
too
soon
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
the
place
,
my
dear
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
the
path
,
and
go
straight
through
the
little
wood
you
'll
come
to
.
 
<EOS>
The
path
is
narrower
there
,
but
you
ca
n't
miss
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
shall
I
see
you
again
?
 
<EOS>
Soon
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
replied
Montague
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
pleasant
ride
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
long
as
Mr
Pecksniff
was
in
sight
,
and
turned
his
head
at
intervals
to
salute
him
,
Montague
stood
in
the
road
smiling
,
and
waving
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
his
new
partner
had
disappeared
,
and
this
show
was
no
longer
necessary
,
he
sat
down
on
the
stile
with
looks
so
altered
,
that
he
might
have
grown
ten
years
older
in
the
meantime
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
flushed
with
wine
,
but
not
gay
.
 
<EOS>
His
scheme
had
succeeded
,
but
he
showed
no
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
The
effort
of
sustaining
his
difficult
part
before
his
late
companion
had
fatigued
him
,
perhaps
,
or
it
may
be
that
the
evening
whispered
to
his
conscience
,
or
it
may
be
(
as
it
HAS
been
)
that
a
shadowy
veil
was
dropping
round
him
,
closing
out
all
thoughts
but
the
presentiment
and
vague
foreknowledge
of
impending
doom
.
   
<EOS>
If
there
be
fluids
,
as
we
know
there
are
,
which
,
conscious
of
a
coming
wind
,
or
rain
,
or
frost
,
will
shrink
and
strive
to
hide
themselves
in
their
glass
arteries
;
may
not
that
subtle
liquor
of
the
blood
perceive
,
by
properties
within
itself
,
that
hands
are
raised
to
waste
and
spill
it
;
and
in
the
veins
of
men
run
cold
and
dull
as
his
did
,
in
that
hour
!
   
<EOS>
So
cold
,
although
the
air
was
warm
;
so
dull
,
although
the
sky
was
bright
;
that
he
rose
up
shivering
from
his
seat
,
and
hastily
resumed
his
walk
.
 
<EOS>
He
checked
himself
as
hastily
;
undecided
whether
to
pursue
the
footpath
,
which
was
lonely
and
retired
,
or
to
go
back
by
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
the
footpath
.
   
<EOS>
The
glory
of
the
departing
sun
was
on
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
music
of
the
birds
was
in
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
Sweet
wild
flowers
bloomed
about
him
.
<EOS>
Thatched
roofs
of
poor
men
's
homes
were
in
the
distance
;
and
an
old
grey
spire
,
surmounted
by
a
Cross
,
rose
up
between
him
and
the
coming
night
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
never
read
the
lesson
which
these
things
conveyed
;
he
had
ever
mocked
and
turned
away
from
it
;
but
,
before
going
down
into
a
hollow
place
,
he
looked
round
,
once
,
upon
the
evening
prospect
,
sorrowfully
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
went
down
,
down
,
down
,
into
the
dell
.
   
<EOS>
It
brought
him
to
the
wood
;
a
close
,
thick
,
shadowy
wood
,
through
which
the
path
went
winding
on
,
dwindling
away
into
a
slender
sheep
-
track
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
before
entering
;
for
the
stillness
of
this
spot
almost
daunted
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
last
rays
of
the
sun
were
shining
in
,
aslant
,
making
a
path
of
golden
light
along
the
stems
and
branches
in
its
range
,
which
,
even
as
he
looked
,
began
to
die
away
,
yielding
gently
to
the
twilight
that
came
creeping
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
very
quiet
that
the
soft
and
stealthy
moss
about
the
trunks
of
some
old
trees
,
seemed
to
have
grown
out
of
the
silence
,
and
to
be
its
proper
offspring
.
 
<EOS>
Those
other
trees
which
were
subdued
by
blasts
of
wind
in
winter
time
,
had
not
quite
tumbled
down
,
but
being
caught
by
others
,
lay
all
bare
and
scathed
across
their
leafy
arms
,
as
if
unwilling
to
disturb
the
general
repose
by
the
crash
of
their
fall
.
 
<EOS>
Vistas
of
silence
opened
everywhere
,
into
the
heart
and
innermost
recesses
of
the
wood
;
beginning
with
the
likeness
of
an
aisle
,
a
cloister
,
or
a
ruin
open
to
the
sky
;
then
tangling
off
into
a
deep
green
rustling
mystery
,
through
which
gnarled
trunks
,
and
twisted
boughs
,
and
ivy
-
covered
stems
,
and
trembling
leaves
,
and
bark
-
stripped
bodies
of
old
trees
stretched
out
at
length
,
were
faintly
seen
in
beautiful
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
sunlight
died
away
,
and
evening
fell
upon
the
wood
,
he
entered
it
.
 
<EOS>
Moving
,
here
and
there
a
bramble
or
a
drooping
bough
which
stretched
across
his
path
,
he
slowly
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
At
intervals
a
narrow
opening
showed
him
passing
on
,
or
the
sharp
cracking
of
some
tender
branch
denoted
where
he
went
;
then
,
he
was
seen
or
heard
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
Never
more
beheld
by
mortal
eye
or
heard
by
mortal
ear
;
one
man
excepted
.
 
<EOS>
That
man
,
parting
the
leaves
and
branches
on
the
other
side
,
near
where
the
path
emerged
again
,
came
leaping
out
soon
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
What
had
he
left
within
the
wood
,
that
he
sprang
out
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
hell
!
   
<EOS>
The
body
of
a
murdered
man
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
thick
solitary
spot
,
it
lay
among
the
last
year
's
leaves
of
oak
and
beech
,
just
as
it
had
fallen
headlong
down
.
 
<EOS>
Sopping
and
soaking
in
among
the
leaves
that
formed
its
pillow
;
oozing
down
into
the
boggy
ground
,
as
if
to
cover
itself
from
human
sight
;
forcing
its
way
between
and
through
the
curling
leaves
,
as
if
those
senseless
things
rejected
and
forswore
it
and
were
coiled
up
in
abhorrence
;
went
a
dark
,
dark
stain
that
dyed
the
whole
summer
night
from
earth
to
heaven
.
   
<EOS>
The
doer
of
this
deed
came
leaping
from
the
wood
so
fiercely
,
that
he
cast
into
the
air
a
shower
of
fragments
of
young
boughs
,
torn
away
in
his
passage
,
and
fell
with
violence
upon
the
grass
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
quickly
gained
his
feet
again
,
and
keeping
underneath
a
hedge
with
his
body
bent
,
went
running
on
towards
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
The
road
once
reached
,
he
fell
into
a
rapid
walk
,
and
set
on
toward
London
.
   
<EOS>
And
he
was
not
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
frightened
when
he
thought
of
it
<EOS>
---
when
did
he
not
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
he
was
not
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
a
terror
and
dread
of
the
wood
when
he
was
in
it
;
but
being
out
of
it
,
and
having
committed
the
crime
,
his
fears
were
now
diverted
,
strangely
,
to
the
dark
room
he
had
left
shut
up
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
greater
horror
,
infinitely
greater
,
of
that
room
than
of
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
he
was
on
his
return
to
it
,
it
seemed
beyond
comparison
more
dismal
and
more
dreadful
than
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
His
hideous
secret
was
shut
up
in
the
room
,
and
all
its
terrors
were
there
;
to
his
thinking
it
was
not
in
the
wood
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
He
walked
on
for
ten
miles
;
and
then
stopped
at
an
ale
-
house
for
a
coach
,
which
he
knew
would
pass
through
,
on
its
way
to
London
,
before
long
;
and
which
he
also
knew
was
not
the
coach
he
had
travelled
down
by
,
for
it
came
from
another
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
outside
the
door
here
,
on
a
bench
,
beside
a
man
who
was
smoking
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
Having
called
for
some
beer
,
and
drunk
,
he
offered
it
to
this
companion
,
who
thanked
him
,
and
took
a
draught
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
thinking
that
,
if
the
man
had
known
all
,
he
might
scarcely
have
relished
drinking
out
of
the
same
cup
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
fine
night
,
master
!
<EOS>
"
said
this
person
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
a
rare
sunset
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
see
it
,
"
was
his
hasty
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
see
it
?
"
returned
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
the
devil
could
I
see
it
,
if
I
was
asleep
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Asleep
!
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
man
appeared
surprised
by
his
unexpected
irritability
,
and
saying
no
more
,
smoked
his
pipe
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
not
sat
very
long
,
when
there
was
a
knocking
within
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
cried
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
say
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
replied
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
He
made
no
further
inquiry
,
for
the
last
question
had
escaped
him
in
spite
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
thinking
,
at
the
moment
,
of
the
closed
-
up
room
;
of
the
possibility
of
their
knocking
at
the
door
on
some
special
occasion
;
of
their
being
alarmed
at
receiving
no
answer
;
of
their
bursting
it
open
;
of
their
finding
the
room
empty
;
of
their
fastening
the
door
into
the
court
,
and
rendering
it
impossible
for
him
to
get
into
the
house
without
showing
himself
in
the
garb
he
wore
,
which
would
lead
to
rumour
,
rumour
to
detection
,
detection
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
instant
,
as
if
by
some
design
and
order
of
circumstances
,
the
knocking
had
come
.
   
<EOS>
It
still
continued
;
like
a
warning
echo
of
the
dread
reality
he
had
conjured
up
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
could
not
sit
and
hear
it
,
he
paid
for
his
beer
and
walked
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
having
slunk
about
,
in
places
unknown
to
him
all
day
;
and
being
out
at
night
,
in
a
lonely
road
,
in
an
unusual
dress
and
in
that
wandering
and
unsettled
frame
of
mind
;
he
stopped
more
than
once
to
look
about
him
,
hoping
he
might
be
in
a
dream
.
   
<EOS>
Still
he
was
not
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
hated
the
man
too
much
,
and
had
been
bent
,
too
desperately
and
too
long
,
on
setting
himself
free
.
<EOS>
If
the
thing
could
have
come
over
again
,
he
would
have
done
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
malignant
and
revengeful
passions
were
not
so
easily
laid
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
more
penitence
or
remorse
within
him
now
than
there
had
been
while
the
deed
was
brewing
.
   
<EOS>
Dread
and
fear
were
upon
him
,
to
an
extent
he
had
never
counted
on
,
and
could
not
manage
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
horribly
afraid
of
that
infernal
room
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
him
,
in
a
gloomy
murderous
,
mad
way
,
not
only
fearful
FOR
himself
,
but
OF
himself
;
for
being
,
as
it
were
,
a
part
of
the
room
:
a
something
supposed
to
be
there
,
yet
missing
from
it
:
he
invested
himself
with
its
mysterious
terrors
;
and
when
he
pictured
in
his
mind
the
ugly
chamber
,
false
and
quiet
,
false
and
quiet
,
through
the
dark
hours
of
two
nights
;
and
the
tumbled
bed
,
and
he
not
in
it
,
though
believed
to
be
;
he
became
in
a
manner
his
own
ghost
and
phantom
,
and
was
at
once
the
haunting
spirit
and
the
haunted
man
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
coach
came
up
,
which
it
soon
did
,
he
got
a
place
outside
and
was
carried
briskly
onward
towards
home
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
in
taking
his
seat
among
the
people
behind
,
who
were
chiefly
country
people
,
he
conceived
a
fear
that
they
knew
of
the
murder
,
and
would
tell
him
that
the
body
had
been
found
;
which
,
considering
the
time
and
place
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
,
were
events
almost
impossible
to
have
happened
yet
,
as
he
very
well
knew
.
 
<EOS>
But
although
he
did
know
it
,
and
had
therefore
no
reason
to
regard
their
ignorance
as
anything
but
the
natural
sequence
to
the
facts
,
still
this
very
ignorance
of
theirs
encouraged
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
encouraged
him
,
that
he
began
to
believe
the
body
never
would
be
found
,
and
began
to
speculate
on
that
probability
.
 
<EOS>
Setting
off
from
this
point
,
and
measuring
time
by
the
rapid
hurry
of
his
guilty
thoughts
,
and
what
had
gone
before
the
bloodshed
,
and
the
troops
of
incoherent
and
disordered
images
of
which
he
was
the
constant
prey
;
he
came
by
daylight
to
regard
the
murder
as
an
old
murder
,
and
to
think
himself
comparatively
safe
because
it
had
not
been
discovered
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
!
<EOS>
When
the
sun
which
looked
into
the
wood
,
and
gilded
with
its
rising
light
a
dead
man
's
lace
,
had
seen
that
man
alive
,
and
sought
to
win
him
to
a
thought
of
Heaven
,
on
its
going
down
last
night
!
   
<EOS>
But
here
were
London
streets
again
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
but
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
time
enough
to
reach
his
own
house
unobserved
,
and
before
there
were
many
people
in
the
streets
,
if
nothing
had
happened
so
far
,
tending
to
his
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
He
slipped
down
from
the
coach
without
troubling
the
driver
to
stop
his
horses
;
and
hurrying
across
the
road
,
and
in
and
out
of
every
by
-
way
that
lay
near
his
course
,
at
length
approached
his
own
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
additional
caution
in
his
immediate
neighbourhood
;
halting
first
to
look
all
down
the
street
before
him
;
then
gliding
swiftly
through
that
one
,
and
stopping
to
survey
the
next
,
and
so
on
.
   
<EOS>
The
passage
-
way
was
empty
when
his
murderer
's
face
looked
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
stole
on
,
to
the
door
on
tiptoe
,
as
if
he
dreaded
to
disturb
his
own
imaginary
rest
.
   
<EOS>
He
listened
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
sound
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
turned
the
key
with
a
trembling
hand
,
and
pushed
the
door
softly
open
with
his
knee
,
a
monstrous
fear
beset
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
What
if
the
murdered
man
were
there
before
him
!
   
<EOS>
He
cast
a
fearful
glance
all
round
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
nothing
there
.
   
<EOS>
He
went
in
,
locked
the
door
,
drew
the
key
through
and
through
the
dust
and
damp
in
the
fire
-
place
to
sully
it
again
,
and
hung
it
up
as
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
off
his
disguise
,
tied
it
up
in
a
bundle
ready
for
carrying
away
and
sinking
in
the
river
before
night
,
and
locked
it
up
in
a
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
These
precautions
taken
,
he
undressed
and
went
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
The
raging
thirst
,
the
fire
that
burnt
within
him
as
he
lay
beneath
the
clothes
,
the
augmented
horror
of
the
room
when
they
shut
it
out
from
his
view
;
the
agony
of
listening
,
in
which
he
paid
enforced
regard
to
every
sound
,
and
thought
the
most
unlikely
one
the
prelude
to
that
knocking
which
should
bring
the
news
;
the
starts
with
which
he
left
his
couch
,
and
looking
in
the
glass
,
imagined
that
his
deed
was
broadly
written
in
his
face
,
and
lying
down
and
burying
himself
once
more
beneath
the
blankets
,
heard
his
own
heart
beating
Murder
,
Murder
,
Murder
,
in
the
bed
;
what
words
can
paint
tremendous
truths
like
these
!
   
<EOS>
The
morning
advanced
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
footsteps
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
heard
the
blinds
drawn
up
,
and
shutters
opened
;
and
now
and
then
a
stealthy
tread
outside
his
own
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
call
out
,
more
than
once
,
but
his
mouth
was
dry
as
if
it
had
been
filled
with
sand
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
,
and
cried
:
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
He
asked
her
what
it
was
o'clock
?
 
<EOS>
Nine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
---
did
no
one
knock
at
my
door
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
he
faltered
.
<EOS>
"
Something
disturbed
me
;
but
unless
you
had
knocked
the
door
down
,
you
would
have
got
no
notice
from
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
waited
,
almost
breathless
,
for
her
answer
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
relief
to
him
,
if
anything
could
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Nadgett
wanted
to
see
you
,
"
she
said
,
"
but
I
told
him
you
were
tired
,
and
had
requested
not
to
be
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
of
little
consequence
,
and
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
was
opening
my
window
to
let
in
the
cool
air
,
I
saw
him
passing
through
the
street
this
morning
,
very
early
;
but
he
has
n't
been
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Passing
through
the
street
that
morning
?
 
<EOS>
Very
early
!
 
<EOS>
Jonas
trembled
at
the
thought
of
having
had
a
narrow
chance
of
seeing
him
himself
;
even
him
,
who
had
no
object
but
to
avoid
people
,
and
sneak
on
unobserved
,
and
keep
his
own
secrets
;
and
who
saw
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
He
called
to
her
to
get
his
breakfast
ready
,
and
prepared
to
go
upstairs
;
attiring
himself
in
the
clothes
he
had
taken
off
when
he
came
into
that
room
,
which
had
been
,
ever
since
,
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
In
his
secret
dread
of
meeting
the
household
for
the
first
time
,
after
what
he
had
done
,
he
lingered
at
the
door
on
slight
pretexts
that
they
might
see
him
without
looking
in
his
face
;
and
left
it
ajar
while
he
dressed
;
and
called
out
to
have
the
windows
opened
,
and
the
pavement
watered
,
that
they
might
become
accustomed
to
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
he
had
put
off
the
time
,
by
one
means
or
other
,
so
that
he
had
seen
or
spoken
to
them
all
,
he
could
not
muster
courage
for
a
long
while
to
go
in
among
them
,
but
stood
at
his
own
door
listening
to
the
murmur
of
their
distant
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
He
could
not
stop
there
for
ever
,
and
so
joined
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
last
glance
at
the
glass
had
seen
a
tell
-
tale
face
,
but
that
might
have
been
because
of
his
anxious
looking
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
dared
not
look
at
them
to
see
if
they
observed
him
,
but
he
thought
them
very
silent
.
   
<EOS>
And
whatsoever
guard
<EOS>
he
kept
upon
himself
,
he
could
not
help
listening
,
and
showing
that
he
listened
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
attended
to
their
talk
,
or
tried
to
think
of
other
things
,
or
talked
himself
,
or
held
his
peace
,
or
resolutely
counted
the
dull
tickings
of
a
hoarse
clock
at
his
back
,
he
always
lapsed
,
as
if
a
spell
were
on
him
,
into
eager
listening
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
knew
it
must
come
.
 
<EOS>
And
his
present
punishment
,
and
torture
and
distraction
,
were
,
to
listen
for
its
coming
.
   
<EOS>
Hush

Chapter
48
.
<EOS>
Bears
tidings
of
Martin
and
of
Mark
,
as
well
as
of
a
third
person
not
quite
unknown
to
the
reader
.
 
<EOS>
Exhibits
filial
piety
in
an
ugly
aspect
;
and
casts
a
doubtful
ray
of
light
upon
a
very
dark
place
 
Tom
Pinch
and
Ruth
were
sitting
at
their
early
breakfast
,
with
the
window
open
,
and
a
row
of
the
freshest
little
plants
ranged
before
it
on
the
inside
by
Ruth
's
own
hands
;
and
Ruth
had
fastened
a
sprig
of
geranium
in
Tom
's
button
-
hole
,
to
make
him
very
smart
and
summer
-
like
for
the
day
(
it
was
obliged
to
be
fastened
in
,
or
that
dear
old
Tom
was
certain
to
lose
it
)
;
and
people
were
crying
flowers
up
and
down
the
street
;
and
a
blundering
bee
,
who
had
got
himself
in
between
the
two
sashes
of
the
window
,
was
bruising
his
head
against
the
glass
,
endeavouring
to
force
himself
out
into
the
fine
morning
,
and
considering
himself
enchanted
because
he
could
n't
do
it
;
and
the
morning
was
as
fine
a
morning
as
ever
was
seen
;
and
the
fragrant
air
was
kissing
Ruth
and
rustling
about
Tom
,
as
if
it
said
,
"
how
are
you
,
my
dears
;
I
came
all
this
way
on
purpose
to
salute
you
;
"
and
it
was
one
of
those
glad
times
when
we
form
,
or
ought
to
form
,
the
wish
that
every
one
on
earth
were
able
to
be
happy
,
and
catching
glimpses
of
the
summer
of
the
heart
,
to
feel
the
beauty
of
the
summer
of
the
year
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
even
a
pleasanter
breakfast
than
usual
;
and
it
was
always
a
pleasant
one
.
 
<EOS>
For
little
Ruth
had
now
two
pupils
to
attend
,
each
three
times
a
week
;
and
each
two
hours
at
a
time
;
and
besides
this
,
she
had
painted
some
screens
and
card
-
racks
,
and
,
unknown
to
Tom
<EOS>
(
was
there
ever
anything
so
delightful
!
)
,
had
walked
into
a
certain
shop
which
dealt
in
such
articles
,
after
often
peeping
through
the
window
;
and
had
taken
courage
to
ask
the
Mistress
of
that
shop
whether
she
would
buy
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
mistress
had
not
only
bought
them
,
but
had
ordered
more
,
and
that
very
morning
Ruth
had
made
confession
of
these
facts
to
Tom
,
and
had
handed
him
the
money
in
a
little
purse
she
had
worked
expressly
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
in
a
flutter
about
this
,
and
perhaps
had
shed
a
happy
tear
or
two
for
anything
the
history
knows
to
the
contrary
;
but
it
was
all
over
now
;
and
a
brighter
face
than
Tom
's
,
or
a
brighter
face
than
Ruth
's
,
the
bright
sun
had
not
looked
on
since
he
went
to
bed
last
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
,
"
said
Tom
,
coming
so
abruptly
on
the
subject
,
that
he
interrupted
himself
in
the
act
of
cutting
a
slice
of
bread
,
and
left
the
knife
sticking
in
the
loaf
,
"
what
a
queer
fellow
our
landlord
is
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
he
has
been
home
once
since
he
got
me
into
that
unsatisfactory
scrape
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
he
will
never
come
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
mysterious
life
that
man
does
lead
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
strange
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
hope
it
is
only
strange
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
there
may
be
nothing
wrong
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
begin
to
be
doubtful
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
an
explanation
with
him
,
"
said
Tom
,
shaking
his
head
as
if
this
were
a
most
tremendous
threat
,
"
when
I
can
catch
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
short
double
knock
at
the
door
put
Tom
's
menacing
looks
to
flight
,
and
awakened
an
expression
of
surprise
instead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heyday
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
early
hour
for
visitors
!
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
John
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
do
n't
think
it
was
his
knock
,
Tom
,
"
observed
his
little
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
surely
ca
n't
be
my
employer
suddenly
arrived
in
town
;
directed
here
by
Mr
Fips
;
and
come
for
the
key
of
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
somebody
inquiring
for
me
,
I
declare
!
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
if
you
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
when
the
person
came
in
,
Tom
Pinch
,
instead
of
saying
,
"
Did
you
wish
to
speak
with
me
,
sir
?
"
or
,
"
My
name
is
Pinch
,
sir
;
what
is
your
business
,
may
I
ask
?
"
or
addressing
him
in
any
such
distant
terms
;
cried
out
,
"
Good
gracious
Heaven
!
"
and
seized
him
by
both
hands
,
with
the
liveliest
manifestations
of
astonishment
and
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
The
visitor
was
not
less
moved
than
Tom
himself
,
and
they
shook
hands
a
great
many
times
,
without
another
word
being
spoken
on
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
was
the
first
to
find
his
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
Tapley
,
too
!
"
said
Tom
,
running
towards
the
door
,
and
shaking
hands
with
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mark
,
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
you
,
Mark
?
 
<EOS>
He
do
n't
look
a
day
older
than
he
used
to
do
at
the
Dragon
.
<EOS>
How
ARE
you
,
Mark
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Uncommonly
jolly
,
sir
,
thank'ee
,
"
returned
Mr
Tapley
,
all
smiles
and
bows
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
see
you
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
me
!
"
cried
Tom
,
patting
him
tenderly
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
"
How
delightful
it
is
to
hear
his
old
voice
again
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Martin
,
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
My
sister
,
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
Tapley
from
the
Dragon
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Good
gracious
me
<EOS>
,
what
a
surprise
this
is
!
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
bless
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
that
he
could
n't
keep
himself
still
for
a
moment
,
but
was
constantly
running
between
Mark
and
Martin
,
shaking
hands
with
them
alternately
,
and
presenting
them
over
and
over
again
to
his
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
the
day
we
parted
,
Martin
,
as
well
as
if
it
were
yesterday
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
day
it
was
!
<EOS>
and
what
a
passion
you
were
in
!
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
remember
my
overtaking
you
in
the
road
that
morning
,
Mark
,
when
I
was
going
to
Salisbury
in
the
gig
to
fetch
him
,
and
you
were
looking
out
for
a
situation
?
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
recollect
the
dinner
we
had
at
Salisbury
,
Martin
,
with
John
Westlock
,
eh
!
 
<EOS>
Good
gracious
me
!
 
<EOS>
Ruth
,
my
dear
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
Tapley
,
my
love
,
from
the
Dragon
.
 
<EOS>
More
cups
and
saucers
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
<EOS>
my
soul
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
both
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
then
Tom
(
as
John
Westlock
had
done
on
his
arrival
)
ran
off
to
the
loaf
to
cut
some
bread
and
butter
for
them
;
and
before
he
had
spread
a
single
slice
,
remembered
something
else
,
and
came
running
back
again
to
tell
it
;
and
then
he
shook
hands
with
them
again
;
and
then
he
introduced
his
sister
again
;
and
then
he
did
everything
he
had
done
already
all
over
again
;
and
nothing
Tom
could
do
,
and
nothing
Tom
could
say
,
was
half
sufficient
to
express
his
joy
at
their
safe
return
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
was
the
first
to
resume
his
composure
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
very
short
space
of
time
he
was
discovered
to
have
somehow
installed
himself
in
office
as
waiter
,
or
attendant
upon
the
party
;
a
fact
which
was
first
suggested
to
them
by
his
temporary
absence
in
the
kitchen
,
and
speedy
return
with
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
,
from
which
he
replenished
the
tea
-
pot
with
a
self
-
possession
that
was
quite
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
and
take
your
breakfast
,
Mark
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Make
him
sit
down
and
take
his
breakfast
,
Martin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
gave
him
up
,
long
ago
,
as
incorrigible
,
"
Martin
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
takes
his
own
way
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
excuse
him
,
Miss
Pinch
,
if
you
knew
his
value
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
knows
it
,
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
her
all
about
Mark
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
Have
I
not
,
Ruth
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
all
,
"
returned
Martin
,
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
best
of
Mark
Tapley
is
only
known
to
one
man
,
Tom
;
and
but
for
Mark
he
would
hardly
be
alive
to
tell
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mark
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
Pinch
energetically
;
"
if
you
do
n't
sit
down
this
minute
,
I
'll
swear
at
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Tapley
,
"
sooner
than
you
should
do
that
<EOS>
,
I
'll
com
-
ply
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
considerable
invasion
of
a
man
's
jollity
to
be
made
so
partickler
welcome
,
but
a
Werb
is
a
word
as
signifies
to
be
,
to
do
,
or
to
suffer
(
which
is
all
the
grammar
,
and
enough
too
,
as
ever
I
wos
taught
)
;
and
if
there
's
a
Werb
alive
,
I
'm
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
'm
always
a
-
bein
'
,
sometimes
a
-
doin
'
,
and
continually
a
-
sufferin
'
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
jolly
yet
?
"
asked
Tom
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
was
rather
so
,
over
the
water
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Tapley
;
"
and
not
entirely
without
credit
.
 
<EOS>
But
Human
Natur
"
is
in
a
conspiracy
again
'
<EOS>
me
;
I
ca
n't
get
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
to
leave
it
in
my
will
,
sir
,
to
be
wrote
upon
my
tomb
:
"
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
as
might
have
come
out
strong
if
he
could
have
got
a
chance
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
denied
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
took
this
occasion
of
looking
about
him
with
a
grin
,
and
subsequently
attacking
the
breakfast
,
with
an
appetite
not
at
all
expressive
of
blighted
hopes
,
or
insurmountable
despondency
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
Martin
drew
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
Tom
and
his
sister
,
and
related
to
them
what
had
passed
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
;
adding
in
few
words
a
general
summary
of
the
distresses
and
disappointments
he
had
undergone
since
he
left
England
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
your
faithful
stewardship
in
the
trust
I
left
with
you
,
Tom
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
for
all
your
goodness
and
disinterestedness
,
I
can
never
thank
you
enough
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
add
Mary
's
thanks
to
mine
---
<EOS>
"
   
Ah
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
The
blood
retreated
from
his
cheeks
,
and
came
rushing
back
,
so
violently
,
that
it
was
pain
to
feel
it
;
ease
though
,
ease
,
compared
with
the
aching
of
his
wounded
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
add
Mary
's
thanks
to
mine
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
I
have
made
the
only
poor
acknowledgment
it
is
in
our
power
to
offer
;
but
if
you
knew
how
much
we
feel
,
Tom
,
you
would
set
some
store
by
it
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
And
if
they
had
known
how
much
Tom
felt
---
but
that
no
human
creature
ever
knew
---
they
would
have
set
some
store
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
they
would
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
changed
the
topic
of
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sorry
he
could
not
pursue
it
,
as
it
gave
Martin
pleasure
;
but
he
was
unable
,
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
No
drop
of
envy
or
bitterness
was
in
his
soul
;
but
he
could
not
master
the
firm
utterance
of
her
name
.
   
<EOS>
He
inquired
what
Martin
's
projects
were
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
longer
to
make
your
fortune
,
Tom
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
but
to
try
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
that
once
in
London
,
Tom
;
and
failed
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
advice
and
friendly
counsel
,
I
may
succeed
better
under
your
guidance
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
anything
Tom
,
anything
,
to
gain
a
livelihood
by
my
own
exertions
.
 
<EOS>
My
hopes
do
not
soar
above
that
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
High
-
hearted
,
noble
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
Sorry
to
find
the
pride
of
his
old
companion
humbled
,
and
to
hear
him
speaking
in
this
altered
strain
at
once
<EOS>
,
at
once
,
he
drove
from
his
breast
the
inability
to
contend
with
its
deep
emotions
,
and
spoke
out
bravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
hopes
do
not
soar
above
that
!
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
talk
so
!
 
<EOS>
They
soar
up
to
the
time
when
you
will
be
happy
with
her
,
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
They
soar
up
to
the
time
when
you
will
be
able
to
claim
her
,
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
They
soar
up
to
the
time
when
you
will
not
be
able
to
believe
that
you
were
ever
cast
down
in
spirit
,
or
poor
in
pocket
,
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
Advice
,
and
friendly
counsel
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
shall
have
better
advice
and
counsel
(
though
you
can
not
have
more
friendly
)
than
mine
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
consult
John
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
go
there
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
yet
so
early
that
I
shall
have
time
to
take
you
to
his
chambers
before
I
go
to
business
;
they
are
in
my
way
;
and
I
can
leave
you
there
,
to
talk
over
your
affairs
with
him
.
<EOS>
So
come
along
.
 
<EOS>
Come
along
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
of
occupation
now
,
you
know
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
his
pleasantest
smile
;
"
and
have
no
time
to
lose
.
 
<EOS>
Your
hopes
do
n't
soar
higher
than
that
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
they
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
,
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
be
soaring
out
of
sight
soon
,
Martin
,
and
leaving
all
the
rest
of
us
leagues
behind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
may
be
a
little
changed
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
since
you
knew
me
pretty
well
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
be
changed
?
 
<EOS>
You
talk
as
if
you
were
an
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
such
a
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
Come
to
John
Westlock
's
,
come
.
 
<EOS>
Come
along
,
Mark
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
Mark
's
doing
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
and
it
serves
you
right
for
having
such
a
grumbler
for
your
companion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
credit
to
be
got
through
being
jolly
with
YOU
,
Mr
Pinch
,
anyways
,
"
said
Mark
,
with
his
face
all
wrinkled
up
with
grins
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
parish
doctor
might
be
jolly
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
short
of
goin'
to
the
U
-
nited
States
for
a
second
trip
,
as
would
make
it
at
all
creditable
to
be
jolly
,
arter
seein
'
you
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
laughed
,
and
taking
leave
of
his
sister
,
hurried
Mark
and
Martin
out
into
the
street
,
and
away
to
John
Westlock
's
by
the
nearest
road
;
for
his
hour
of
business
was
very
near
at
hand
,
and
he
prided
himself
on
always
being
exact
to
his
time
.
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
was
at
home
,
but
,
strange
to
say
,
was
rather
embarrassed
to
see
them
;
and
when
Tom
was
about
to
go
into
the
room
where
he
was
breakfasting
,
said
he
had
a
stranger
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
be
a
mysterious
stranger
,
for
John
shut
that
door
as
he
said
it
,
and
led
them
into
the
next
room
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
very
much
delighted
,
though
,
to
see
Mark
Tapley
;
and
received
Martin
with
his
own
frank
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
But
Martin
felt
that
he
did
not
inspire
John
Westlock
with
any
unusual
interest
;
and
twice
or
thrice
observed
that
he
looked
at
Tom
Pinch
doubtfully
;
not
to
say
compassionately
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
,
and
blushed
to
think
,
that
he
knew
the
cause
of
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
apprehend
you
are
engaged
,
"
said
Martin
,
when
Tom
had
announced
the
purport
of
their
visit
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
allow
me
to
come
again
at
your
own
time
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
do
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
AM
engaged
,
"
replied
John
,
with
some
reluctance
;
"
but
the
matter
on
which
I
am
engaged
is
one
,
to
say
the
truth
,
more
immediately
demanding
your
knowledge
than
mine
.
"
   
"
Indeed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
relates
to
a
member
of
your
family
,
and
is
of
a
serious
nature
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
remain
here
,
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
have
it
privately
communicated
to
you
,
in
order
that
you
may
judge
of
its
importance
for
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
in
the
meantime
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
must
really
take
myself
off
,
without
any
further
ceremony
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
your
business
so
very
particular
,
"
asked
Martin
,
"
that
you
can
not
remain
with
us
for
half
an
hour
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
.
 
<EOS>
What
IS
your
business
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
Tom
's
turn
to
be
embarrassed
now
;
but
he
plainly
said
,
after
a
little
hesitation
:
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
am
not
at
liberty
to
say
what
it
is
,
Martin
;
though
I
hope
soon
to
be
in
a
condition
to
do
so
,
and
am
aware
of
no
other
reason
to
prevent
my
doing
so
now
,
than
the
request
of
my
employer
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
an
awkward
position
to
be
placed
in
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
an
uneasy
sense
of
seeming
to
doubt
his
friend
,
"
as
I
feel
every
day
;
but
I
really
can
not
help
it
,
can
I
,
John
?
"
   
<EOS>
John
Westlock
replied
in
the
negative
;
and
Martin
,
expressing
himself
perfectly
satisfied
,
begged
them
not
to
say
another
word
;
though
he
could
not
help
wondering
very
much
what
curious
office
Tom
held
,
and
why
he
was
so
secret
,
and
embarrassed
,
and
unlike
himself
,
in
reference
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
could
he
help
reverting
to
it
,
in
his
own
mind
,
<EOS>
several
times
after
Tom
went
away
,
which
he
did
as
soon
as
this
conversation
was
ended
,
taking
Mr
Tapley
with
him
,
who
,
as
he
laughingly
said
,
might
accompany
him
as
far
as
Fleet
Street
without
injury
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
mean
to
do
,
Mark
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Tom
,
as
they
walked
on
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mean
to
do
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Mr
Tapley
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
.
 
<EOS>
What
course
of
life
do
you
mean
to
pursue
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
that
I
have
been
a
-
thinking
rather
of
the
matrimonial
line
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
,
Mark
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
a
-
turnin
'
of
it
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
the
lady
,
Mark
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
which
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
said
,
"
replied
Tom
,
laughing
,
"
as
well
as
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
suppressed
his
own
inclination
to
laugh
;
and
with
one
of
his
most
whimsically
-
twisted
looks
,
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
You
could
n't
guess
,
I
suppose
,
Mr
Pinch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
possible
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
any
of
your
flames
,
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
Except
Mrs
Lupin
,
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
"
retorted
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
supposing
it
was
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
stopping
in
the
street
to
look
at
him
,
Mr
Tapley
for
a
moment
presented
to
his
view
an
utterly
stolid
and
expressionless
face
;
a
perfect
dead
wall
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
But
opening
window
after
window
in
it
with
astonishing
rapidity
,
and
lighting
them
all
up
as
for
a
general
illumination
,
he
repeated
:
   
"
Supposin
'
,
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
as
it
was
her
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
I
thought
such
a
connection
would
n't
suit
you
,
Mark
,
on
any
terms
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
so
myself
,
once
,
"
said
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
ai
n't
so
clear
about
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
A
dear
,
sweet
creetur
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
dear
,
sweet
creature
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
she
is
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
she
always
was
a
dear
,
sweet
creature
,
was
she
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
WAS
she
not
!
"
<EOS>
assented
Mr
Tapley
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
on
earth
did
n't
you
marry
her
at
first
,
Mark
,
instead
of
wandering
abroad
,
and
losing
all
this
time
,
and
leaving
her
alone
by
herself
,
liable
to
be
courted
by
other
people
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mr
Tapley
,
in
a
spirit
of
unbounded
confidence
<EOS>
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
come
about
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
me
,
Mr
Pinch
,
sir
;
there
ai
n't
a
gentleman
alive
as
knows
me
better
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
acquainted
with
my
constitution
,
and
you
're
acquainted
with
my
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
My
constitution
is
,
to
be
jolly
;
and
my
weakness
is
,
to
wish
to
find
a
credit
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Wery
good
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
mind
,
I
gets
a
notion
in
my
head
that
she
looks
on
me
with
a
eye
of
---
with
what
you
may
call
a
favourable
sort
of
a
eye
in
fact
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
with
modest
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
replied
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
knew
that
perfectly
well
when
we
spoke
on
this
subject
long
ago
;
before
you
left
the
Dragon
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
nodded
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
But
bein
'
at
that
time
full
of
hopeful
wisions
,
I
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
no
credit
is
to
be
got
out
of
such
a
way
of
life
as
that
,
where
everything
agreeable
would
be
ready
to
one
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Lookin
'
on
the
bright
side
of
human
life
in
short
,
one
of
my
hopeful
wisions
is
,
that
there
's
a
deal
of
misery
awaitin
'
for
me
;
in
the
midst
of
which
I
may
come
out
tolerable
strong
,
and
be
jolly
under
circumstances
as
reflects
some
credit
.
 
<EOS>
I
goes
into
the
world
,
sir
,
wery
boyant
,
and
I
tries
this
.
<EOS>
I
goes
aboard
ship
first
,
and
wery
soon
discovers
(
by
the
ease
with
which
I
'm
jolly
,
mind
you
)
as
there
's
no
credit
to
be
got
THERE
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
took
warning
by
this
,
and
gave
it
up
;
but
I
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
gets
to
the
U
-
nited
States
;
and
then
I
DO
begin
<EOS>
,
I
wo
n't
deny
it
,
to
feel
some
little
credit
in
sustaining
my
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
What
follows
?
<EOS>
Jest
as
I
'm
a
-
beginning
to
come
out
,
and
am
a
-
treadin
'
on
the
werge
,
my
master
deceives
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Deceives
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Swindles
me
,
"
retorted
Mr
Tapley
with
a
beaming
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Turns
his
back
on
everything
as
made
his
service
a
creditable
one
,
and
leaves
me
high
and
dry
,
without
a
leg
to
stand
upon
.
 
<EOS>
In
which
state
I
returns
home
.
 
<EOS>
Wery
good
.
 
<EOS>
Then
all
my
hopeful
wisions
bein
'
crushed
;
and
findin
'
that
there
ai
n't
no
credit
for
me
nowhere
<EOS>
;
I
abandons
myself
to
despair
,
and
says
,
"
Let
me
do
that
as
has
the
least
credit
in
it
of
all
;
marry
a
dear
,
sweet
creetur
,
as
is
wery
fond
of
me
;
me
bein

,
at
the

time

wery
fond
of
her
;
lead
a
happy
life

and
struggle
no

the
blight
which
settles
on
my
prospects

"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
your
philosophy

Mark

"
said
Tom
,
who
laughed
heartily
at
this
speech
,
"
be
the
oddest
I
ever
heard
of
,
it
is
not
the
least
wise

<EOS>
Mrs
Lupin
has
said
"
yes
,
"
of
course
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no

sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Tapley
;
"
she
has
n't
gone
so
far
as
that
yet

<EOS>
Which
I
attribute
principally
to
my
not

But
we

I

<EOS>
It

"

"
Well

stopping
at
the
Temple

Good

<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Mr
Pinch
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
by
way
of
soliloquy
,
as
he
stood
looking
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Although
you
ARE
a
damper
to
a
honourable
ambition
.
 
<EOS>
You
little
think
it
,
but
you
was
the
first
to
dash
my
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
Pecksniff
would
have
built
me
up
for
life
,
but
your
sweet
temper
pulled
me
down
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Mr
Pinch
!

<EOS>
While
these
confidences
were
interchanged
between
Tom
Pinch
and
Mark
,
Martin
and
John
Westlock
were
very
differently
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
no
sooner
left
alone
together
than
Martin
said
,
with
an
effort
he
could
not
disguise
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Westlock
,
we
have
met
only
once
before
,
but
you
have
known
Tom
a
long
while
,
and
that
seems
to
render
you
familiar
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
talk
freely
with
you
on
any
subject
unless
I
relieve
my
mind
of
what
oppresses
it
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
with
pain
that
you
so
far
mistrust
me
that
you
think
me
likely
to
impose
on
Tom
's
regardlessness
of
himself
,
or
on
his
kind
nature
,
or
some
of
his
good
qualities
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
intention
,
"
replied
John
,
"
of
conveying
any
such
impression
to
you
,
and
am
exceedingly
sorry
to
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
entertain
it
?
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ask
me
so
pointedly
and
directly
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
that
I
can
not
deny
the
having
accustomed
myself
to
regard
you
as
one
who
,
not
in
wantonness
but
in
mere
thoughtlessness
of
character
,
did
not
sufficiently
consider
his
nature
and
did
not
quite
treat
it
as
it
deserves
to
be
treated
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
much
easier
to
slight
than
to
appreciate
Tom
Pinch
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
not
said
warmly
,
but
was
energetically
spoken
too
;
for
there
was
no
subject
in
the
world
(
but
one
)
on
which
the
speaker
felt
so
strongly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
grew
into
the
knowledge
of
Tom
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
as
I
grew
towards
manhood
;
and
I
have
learned
to
love
him
as
something
,
infinitely
better
than
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
that
you
understood
him
when
we
met
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
that
you
greatly
cared
to
understand
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
instances
of
this
which
I
observed
in
you
were
,
like
my
opportunities
for
observation
,
very
trivial
---
and
were
very
harmless
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
agreeable
to
me
,
and
they
forced
themselves
upon
me
;
for
I
was
not
upon
the
watch
for
them
,
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
say
,
"
added
John
,
with
a
smile
,
as
he
subsided
into
more
of
his
accustomed
manner
,
"
that
I
am
not
by
any
means
agreeable
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
assure
you
,
in
reply
,
that
I
would
not
have
originated
this
topic
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
originated
it
,
"
said
Martin
;
"
and
so
far
from
having
any
complaint
to
make
against
you
,
highly
esteem
the
friendship
you
entertain
for
Tom
,
and
the
very
many
proofs
you
have
given
him
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
endeavour
to
conceal
from
you
"
---
<EOS>
he
coloured
deeply
though
---
"
that
I
neither
understood
him
nor
cared
to
understand
him
when
I
was
his
companion
;
and
that
I
am
very
truly
sorry
for
it
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
so
sincerely
said
,
at
once
so
modestly
and
manfully
,
that
John
offered
him
his
hand
as
if
he
had
not
done
so
before
;
and
Martin
giving
his
in
the
same
open
spirit
,
all
constraint
between
the
young
men
vanished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
pray
,
"
said
John
,
"
when
I
tire
your
patience
very
much
in
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
recollect
that
it
has
an
end
to
it
,
and
that
the
end
is
the
point
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
preface
,
he
related
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
his
having
presided
over
the
illness
and
slow
recovery
of
the
patient
at
the
Bull
;
and
tacked
on
to
the
skirts
of
that
narrative
<EOS>
Tom
's
own
account
of
the
business
on
the
wharf
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
was
not
a
little
puzzled
when
he
came
to
an
end
,
for
the
two
stories
seemed
to
have
no
connection
with
each
other
,
and
to
leave
him
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
all
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
excuse
me
for
one
moment
,
"
said
John
,
rising
,
"
I
will
beg
you
almost
immediately
to
come
into
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
he
left
Martin
to
himself
,
in
a
state
of
considerable
astonishment
;
and
soon
came
back
again
to
fulfil
his
promise
.
<EOS>
Accompanying
him
into
the
next
room
,
Martin
found
there
a
third
person
;
no
doubt
the
stranger
of
whom
his
host
had
spoken
when
Tom
Pinch
introduced
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
man
;
with
deep
black
hair
and
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
gaunt
and
pale
;
and
evidently
had
not
long
recovered
from
a
severe
illness
.
<EOS>
He
stood
as
Martin
entered
,
but
sat
again
at
John
's
desire
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
cast
downward
;
and
but
for
one
glance
at
them
both
,
half
in
humiliation
and
half
in
entreaty
,
he
kept
them
so
,
and
sat
quite
still
and
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
person
's
name
is
Lewsome
,
"
said
John
Westlock
,
"
whom
I
have
mentioned
to
you
as
having
been
seized
with
an
illness
at
the
inn
near
here
,
and
undergone
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
had
a
very
hard
time
of
it
,
ever
since
he
began
to
recover
;
but
,
as
you
see
,
he
is
now
doing
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
did
not
move
or
speak
,
and
John
Westlock
made
a
pause
,
Martin
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
,
said
that
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
short
statement
that
I
wish
you
to
hear
from
his
own
lips
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
John
pursued
---
looking
attentively
at
him
,
and
not
at
Martin
---
<EOS>
"
he
made
to
me
for
the
first
time
yesterday
,
and
repeated
to
me
this
morning
,
without
the
least
variation
of
any
essential
particular
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
told
you
that
he
informed
me
before
he
was
removed
from
the
Inn
,
that
he
had
a
secret
to
disclose
to
me
which
lay
heavy
on
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
fluctuating
between
sickness
and
health
and
between
his
desire
to
relieve
himself
of
it
,
and
his
dread
of
involving
himself
by
revealing
it
,
he
has
,
until
yesterday
,
avoided
the
disclosure
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
pressed
him
for
it
(
having
no
idea
of
its
weight
or
import
,
or
of
my
right
to
do
so
)
,
until
within
a
few
days
past
;
when
,
understanding
from
him
,
on
his
own
voluntary
avowal
,
in
a
letter
from
the
country
,
that
it
related
to
a
person
whose
name
was
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
;
and
thinking
that
it
might
throw
some
light
on
that
little
mystery
which
made
Tom
anxious
now
and
then
;
I
urged
the
point
upon
him
,
and
heard
his
statement
,
as
you
will
now
,
from
his
own
lips
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
due
to
him
to
say
,
that
in
the
apprehension
of
death
,
he
committed
it
to
writing
sometime
since
,
and
folded
it
in
a
sealed
paper
,
addressed
to
me
;
which
he
could
not
resolve
,
however
,
to
place
of
his
own
act
in
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
the
paper
in
his
breast
,
I
believe
,
at
this
moment
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
man
touched
it
hastily
;
in
corroboration
of
the
fact
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
well
to
leave
that
in
our
charge
,
perhaps
,
"
said
John
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
not
mind
it
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
he
held
up
his
hand
to
bespeak
Martin
's
attention
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
fixed
upon
the
man
before
him
,
who
,
after
a
short
silence
said
,
in
a
low
,
weak
,
hollow
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
relation
was
Mr
Anthony
Chuzzlewit
,
who
---
"
   
"
---
Who
died
---
to
me
?
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
my
grandfather
's
brother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
he
was
made
away
with
.
 
<EOS>
Murdered
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
whom
?
"
   
The
young
man
,
Lewsome
,
looked
up
in
his
face
,
and
casting
down
his
eyes
again
,
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
I
fear
,
by
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
you
?
"
cried
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
by
my
act
,
but
I
fear
by
my
means
.
"
   
"
Speak
out
!
"
<EOS>
said
Martin
,
"
and
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
this
IS
the
truth
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
was
about
to
interrupt
him
again
,
but
John
Westlock
saying
softly
,
"
Let
him
tell
his
story
in
his
own
way
,
"
Lewsome
went
on
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
bred
a
surgeon
,
and
for
the
last
few
years
have
served
a
general
practitioner
in
the
City
,
as
his
assistant
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
was
in
his
employment
I
became
acquainted
with
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
principal
in
this
deed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
demanded
Martin
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
he
is
the
son
of
the
old
man
of
whom
you
have
spoken
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
he
answered
.
   
<EOS>
He
remained
silent
for
some
moments
,
when
he
resumed
at
the
point
where
he
had
left
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
reason
to
know
it
;
for
I
have
often
heard
him
wish
his
old
father
dead
,
and
complain
of
his
being
wearisome
to
him
,
and
a
drag
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
,
at
a
place
of
meeting
we
had
---
three
or
four
of
us
---
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
good
in
the
place
you
may
suppose
,
when
you
hear
that
he
was
the
chief
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
died
myself
,
and
never
seen
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
again
;
and
again
resumed
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
met
to
drink
and
game
;
not
for
large
sums
,
but
for
sums
that
were
large
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
generally
won
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
,
he
lent
money
at
interest
to
those
who
lost
;
and
in
this
way
,
though
I
think
we
all
secretly
hated
him
,
he
came
to
be
the
master
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
To
propitiate
him
we
made
a
jest
of
his
father
;
it
began
with
his
debtors
;
I
was
one
;
and
we
used
to
toast
a
quicker
journey
to
the
old
man
,
and
a
swift
inheritance
to
the
young
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
paused
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
night
he
came
there
in
a
very
bad
humour
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
greatly
tried
,
he
said
,
by
the
old
man
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
I
were
alone
together
;
and
he
angrily
told
me
,
that
the
old
man
was
in
his
second
childhood
;
that
he
was
weak
,
imbecile
,
and
drivelling
;
as
unbearable
to
himself
as
he
was
to
other
people
;
and
that
it
would
be
a
charity
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
swore
that
he
had
often
thought
of
mixing
something
with
the
stuff
he
took
for
his
cough
,
which
should
help
him
to
die
easily
.
 
<EOS>
People
were
sometimes
smothered
who
were
bitten
by
mad
dogs
,
he
said
;
and
why
not
help
these
lingering
old
men
out
of
their
troubles
too
?
 
<EOS>
He
looked
full
at
me
as
he
said
so
,
and
I
looked
full
at
him
;
but
it
went
no
farther
that
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
once
more
,
and
was
silent
for
so
long
an
interval
that
John
Westlock
said
"
Go
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
Martin
had
never
removed
his
eyes
from
his
face
,
but
was
so
absorbed
in
horror
and
astonishment
that
he
could
not
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
have
been
a
week
after
that
,
or
it
may
have
been
less
or
more
---
the
matter
was
in
my
mind
all
the
time
,
but
I
can
not
recollect
the
time
,
as
I
should
any
other
period
---
when
he
spoke
to
me
again
.
<EOS>
We
were
alone
then
,
too
;
being
there
before
the
usual
hour
of
assembling
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
appointment
between
us
;
but
I
think
I
went
there
to
meet
him
,
and
I
know
he
came
there
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
there
first
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
reading
a
newspaper
when
I
went
in
,
and
nodded
to
me
without
looking
up
,
or
leaving
off
reading
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
down
opposite
and
close
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
immediately
,
that
he
wanted
me
to
get
him
some
of
two
sorts
of
drugs
.
 
<EOS>
One
that
was
instantaneous
in
its
effect
;
of
which
he
wanted
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
One
that
was
slow
and
not
suspicious
in
appearance
;
of
which
he
wanted
more
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
speaking
to
me
he
still
read
the
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
"
Drugs
,
"
and
never
used
any
other
word
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
did
I.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
all
agrees
with
what
I
have
heard
before
,
"
observed
John
Westlock
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
what
he
wanted
the
drugs
for
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
for
no
harm
;
to
physic
cats
;
what
did
it
matter
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
out
to
a
distant
colony

(
I
had
recently
got
the
appointment
,
which
,
as
Mr
Westlock
knows
,
I
have
since
lost
by
my
sickness
,
and
which
was
my
only
hope
of
salvation
from
ruin
)
,
and
what
did
it
matter
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
He
could
get
them
without
my
aid
at
half
a
hundred
places
,
but
not
so
easily
as
he
could
get
them
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
true
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
not
want
them
at
all
,
he
said
,
and
he
had
no
present
idea
of
using
them
;
but
he
wished
to
have
them
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
he
still
read
the
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
We
talked
about
the
price
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
to
forgive
me
a
small
debt
<EOS>
---
I
was
quite
in
his
power
---
and
to
pay
me
five
pounds
;
and
there
the
matter
dropped
,
through
others
coming
in
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
next
night
,
under
exactly
similar
circumstances
,
I
gave
him
the
drugs
,
on
his
saying
<EOS>
I
was
a
fool
to
think
that
he
should
ever
use
them
for
any
harm
;
and
he
gave
me
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
never
met
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
the
poor
old
father
died
soon
afterwards
,
just
as
he
would
have
died
from
this
cause
;
and
that
I
have
undergone
,
and
suffer
now
,
intolerable
misery
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
stretching
out
his
hands
,
"
can
paint
my
misery
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
well
deserved
,
but
nothing
can
paint
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
hung
his
head
,
and
said
no
more
,
wasted
and
wretched
,
he
was
not
a
creature
upon
whom
to
heap
reproaches
that
were
unavailing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
remain
at
hand
,
"
said
Martin
,
turning
from
him
;
"
but
out
of
sight
,
in
Heaven
's
name
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
will
remain
here
,
"
John
whispered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
Softly
turning
the
key
upon
him
as
they
went
out
,
he
conducted
Martin
into
the
adjoining
room
,
in
which
they
had
been
before
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
was
so
amazed
,
so
shocked
,
and
confounded
by
what
he
had
heard
that
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
reduce
it
to
any
order
in
his
mind
,
or
could
sufficiently
comprehend
the
bearing
of
one
part
upon
another
,
to
take
in
all
the
details
at
one
view
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
,
at
length
,
had
the
whole
narrative
clearly
before
him
,
John
Westlock
went
on
to
point
out
the
great
probability
of
the
guilt
of
Jonas
being
known
to
other
people
,
who
traded
in
it
for
their
own
benefit
,
and
who
were
,
by
such
means
,
able
to
exert
that
control
over
him
which
Tom
Pinch
had
accidentally
witnessed
,
and
unconsciously
assisted
.
 
<EOS>
This
appeared
so
plain
,
that
they
agreed
upon
it
without
difficulty
;
but
instead
of
deriving
the
least
assistance
from
this
source
,
they
found
that
it
embarrassed
them
the
more
.
   
<EOS>
They
knew
nothing
of
the
real
parties
who
possessed
this
power
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
person
before
them
was
Tom
's
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
no
right
to
question
Tom
's
landlord
,
even
if
they
could
find
him
,
which
,
according
to
Tom
's
account
,
it
would
not
be
easy
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
And
granting
that
they
did
question
him
,
and
he
answered
(
which
was
taking
a
good
deal
for
granted
)
,
he
had
only
to
say
,
with
reference
to
the
adventure
on
the
wharf
,
that
he
had
been
sent
from
such
and
such
a
place
to
summon
Jonas
back
on
urgent
business
,
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
was
the
great
difficulty
and
responsibility
of
moving
at
all
in
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Lewsome
's
story
might
be
false
;
in
his
wretched
state
it
might
be
greatly
heightened
by
a
diseased
brain
;
or
admitting
it
to
be
entirely
true
,
the
old
man
might
have
died
a
natural
death
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
been
there
at
the
time
;
as
Tom
immediately
remembered
,
when
he
came
back
in
the
afternoon
,
and
shared
their
counsels
;
and
there
had
been
no
secrecy
about
it
.
<EOS>
Martin
's
grandfather
was
of
right
the
person
to
decide
upon
the
course
that
should
be
taken
;
but
to
get
at
his
views
would
be
impossible
,
for
Mr
Pecksniff
's
views
were
certain
to
be
his
.
<EOS>
And
the
nature
of
Mr
Pecksniff
's
views
in
reference
to
his
own
son
-
in
-
law
might
be
easily
reckoned
upon
.
   
<EOS>
Apart
from
these
considerations
,
Martin
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
seeming
to
grasp
at
this
unnatural
charge
against
his
relative
,
and
using
it
as
a
stepping
-
stone
to
his
grandfather
's
favour
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
he
would
seem
to
do
so
,
if
he
presented
himself
before
his
grandfather
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
house
again
,
for
the
purpose
of
declaring
it
;
and
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
of
all
men
,
would
represent
his
conduct
in
that
despicable
light
,
he
perfectly
well
knew
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
to
be
in
possession
of
such
a
statement
,
and
take
no
measures
of
further
inquiry
in
reference
to
it
,
was
tantamount
to
being
a
partner
in
the
guilt
it
professed
to
disclose
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
they
were
wholly
unable
to
discover
any
outlet
from
this
maze
of
difficulty
,
which
did
not
lie
through
some
perplexed
and
entangled
thicket
.
 
<EOS>
And
although
Mr
Tapley
was
promptly
taken
into
their
confidence
;
and
the
fertile
imagination
of
that
gentleman
suggested
many
bold
expedients
,
which
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
was
quite
ready
to
carry
into
instant
operation
on
his
own
personal
responsibility
;
still
"
bating
the
general
zeal
of
Mr
Tapley
's
nature
,
nothing
was
made
particularly
clearer
by
these
offers
of
service
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
position
of
affairs
that
Tom
's
account
of
the
strange
behaviour
of
the
decayed
clerk
,
on
the
night
of
the
tea
-
party
,
became
of
great
moment
,
and
finally
convinced
them
that
to
arrive
at
a
more
accurate
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
that
old
man
's
mind
and
memory
,
would
be
to
take
a
most
important
stride
in
their
pursuit
of
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
having
first
satisfied
themselves
that
no
communication
had
ever
taken
place
between
Lewsome
and
Mr
Chuffey
(
which
would
have
accounted
at
once
for
any
suspicions
the
latter
might
entertain
)
,
they
unanimously
resolved
that
the
old
clerk
was
the
man
they
wanted
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
like
the
unanimous
resolution
of
a
public
meeting
,
which
will
oftentimes
declare
that
this
or
that
grievance
is
not
to
be
borne
a
moment
longer
,
which
is
nevertheless
borne
for
a
century
or
two
afterwards
,
without
any
modification
,
they
only
reached
in
this
the
conclusion
that
they
were
all
of
one
mind
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
one
thing
to
want
Mr
Chuffey
,
and
another
thing
to
get
at
him
;
and
to
do
that
without
alarming
him
,
or
without
alarming
Jonas
,
or
without
being
discomfited
by
the
difficulty
of
striking
,
in
an
instrument
so
out
of
tune
and
so
unused
,
the
note
they
sought
,
was
an
end
as
far
from
their
reach
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
The
question
then
became
,
who
of
those
about
the
old
clerk
had
had
most
influence
with
him
that
night
?
 
<EOS>
Tom
said
his
young
mistress
clearly
.
 
<EOS>
But
Tom
and
all
of
them
shrunk
from
the
thought
of
entrapping
her
,
and
making
her
the
innocent
means
of
bringing
retribution
on
her
cruel
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Was
there
nobody
else
?
 
<EOS>
Why
yes
.
<EOS>
In
a
very
different
way
,
Tom
said
,
he
was
influenced
by
Mrs
Gamp
,
the
nurse
;
who
had
once
had
the
control
of
him
,
as
he
understood
,
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
They
caught
at
this
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
a
new
way
out
,
developed
in
a
quarter
until
then
overlooked
.
 
<EOS>
John
Westlock
knew
Mrs
Gamp
;
he
had
given
her
employment
;
he
was
acquainted
with
her
place
of
residence
:
for
that
good
lady
had
obligingly
furnished
him
,
at
parting
,
with
a
pack
of
her
professional
cards
for
general
distribution
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
decided
that
Mrs
Gamp
should
be
approached
with
caution
,
but
approached
without
delay
;
and
that
the
depths
of
that
discreet
matron
's
knowledge
of
Mr
Chuffey
,
and
means
of
bringing
them
,
or
one
of
them
,
into
communication
with
him
,
should
be
carefully
sounded
.
   
<EOS>
On
this
service
,
Martin
and
John
Westlock
determined
to
proceed
that
night
;
waiting
on
Mrs
Gamp
first
,
at
her
lodgings
;
and
taking
their
chance
of
finding
her
in
the
repose
of
private
life
,
or
of
having
to
seek
her
out
,
elsewhere
,
in
the
exercise
of
her
professional
duties
.
<EOS>
Tom
returned
home
,
that
he
might
lose
no
opportunity
of
having
an
interview
with
Nadgett
,
by
being
absent
in
the
event
of
his
reappearance
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Tapley
remained
(
by
his
own
particular
desire
)
for
the
time
being
in
Furnival
's
Inn
,
to
look
after
Lewsome
;
who
might
safely
have
been
left
to
himself
,
however
,
for
any
thought
he
seemed
to
entertain
of
giving
them
the
slip
.
   
<EOS>
Before
they
parted
on
their
several
errands
,
they
caused
him
to
read
aloud
,
in
the
presence
of
them
all
,
the
paper
which
he
had
about
him
,
and
the
declaration
he
had
attached
to
it
,
which
was
to
the
effect
that
he
had
written
it
voluntarily
,
in
the
fear
of
death
and
in
the
torture
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
had
done
so
,
they
all
signed
it
,
and
taking
it
from
him
,
of
his
free
will
,
locked
it
in
a
place
of
safety
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
also
wrote
,
by
John
's
advice
,
a
letter
to
the
trustees
of
the
famous
Grammar
School
,
boldly
claiming
the
successful
design
as
his
,
and
charging
Mr
Pecksniff
with
the
fraud
he
had
committed
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
proceeding
also
,
John
was
hotly
interested
;
observing
,
with
his
usual
irreverance
,
that
Mr
Pecksniff
had
been
a
successful
rascal
all
his
life
through
,
and
that
it
would
be
a
lasting
source
of
happiness
to
him
(
John
)
if
he
could
help
to
do
him
justice
in
the
smallest
particular
.
   
<EOS>
A
busy
day
!
 
<EOS>
But
Martin
had
no
lodgings
yet
;
so
when
these
matters
were
disposed
of
,
he
excused
himself
from
dining
with
John
Westlock
and
was
fain
to
wander
out
alone
,
and
look
for
some
.
 
<EOS>
He
succeeded
,
after
great
trouble
,
in
engaging
two
garrets
for
himself
and
Mark
,
situated
in
a
court
in
the
Strand
,
not
far
from
Temple
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
Their
luggage
,
which
was
waiting
for
them
at
a
coach
-
office
<EOS>
,
he
conveyed
to
this
new
place
of
refuge
;
and
it
was
with
a
glow
of
satisfaction
,
which
as
a
selfish
man
he
never
could
have
known
and
never
had
,
that
,
thinking
how
much
pains
and
trouble
he
had
saved
Mark
,
and
how
pleased
and
astonished
Mark
would
be
,
he
afterwards
walked
up
and
down
,
in
the
Temple
,
eating
a
meat
-
pie
for
his
dinner
.

In

Mrs
Harris

the
cause

a
division
between
friends
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
's
apartment
in
Kingsgate
Street
,
High
Holborn
,
wore
,
metaphorically
speaking
,
a
robe
of
state
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
swept
and
garnished
for
the
reception
of
a
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
That
visitor
was
Betsey
Prig
;
Mrs
Prig
,
of
Bartlemy
's
;
or
as
some
said
Barklemy
's
,
or
as
some
said
Bardlemy
's
;
for
by
all
these
endearing
and
familiar
appellations
,
had
the
hospital
of
Saint
Bartholomew
become
a
household
word
among
the
sisterhood
which
Betsey
Prig
adorned
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
's
apartment
was
not
a
spacious
one
,
but
,
to
a
contented
mind
,
a
closet
is
a
palace
;
and
the
first
-
floor
front
at
Mr
Sweedlepipe
's
may
have
been
,
in
the
imagination
of
Mrs
Gamp
,
a
stately
pile
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
were
not
exactly
that
,
to
restless
intellects
,
it
at
least
comprised
as
much
accommodation
as
any
person
,
not
sanguine
to
insanity
,
could
have
looked
for
in
a
room
of
its
dimensions
.
 
<EOS>
For
only
keep
the
bedstead
always
in
your
mind
;
and
you
were
safe
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
grand
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Remembering
the
bedstead
,
you
might
even
stoop
to
look
under
the
little
round
table
for
anything
you
had
dropped
,
without
hurting
yourself
much
against
the
chest
of
drawers
,
or
qualifying
as
a
patient
of
Saint
Bartholomew
,
by
falling
into
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
Visitors
were
much
assisted
in
their
cautious
efforts
to
preserve
an
unflagging
recollection
of
this
piece
of
furniture
,
by
its
size
;
which
was
great
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
,
nor
yet
a
French
bedstead
,
nor
yet
a
four
-
post
bedstead
,
but
what
is
poetically
called
a
tent
;
the
sacking
whereof
was
low
and
bulgy
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
Mrs
Gamp
's
box
would
not
go
under
it
,
but
stopped
half
-
way
,
in
a
manner
which
,
while
it
did
violence
to
the
reason
,
likewise
endangered
the
legs
of
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
The
frame
too
,
which
would
have
supported
the
canopy
and
hangings
if
there
had
been
any
,
was
ornamented
with
divers
pippins
carved
in
timber
,
which
on
the
slightest
provocation
,
and
frequently
on
none
at
all
,
came
tumbling
down
;
harassing
the
peaceful
guest
with
inexplicable
terrors
.
   
<EOS>
The
bed
itself
was
decorated
with
a
patchwork
quilt
of
great
antiquity
;
and
at
the
upper
end
,
upon
the
side
nearest
to
the
door
,
hung
a
scanty
curtain
of
blue
check
,
which
prevented
the
Zephyrs
that
were
abroad
in
Kingsgate
Street
,
from
visiting
Mrs
Gamp
's
head
too
roughly
.
 
<EOS>
Some
rusty
gowns
and
other
articles
of
that
lady
's
wardrobe
depended
from
the
posts
;
and
these
had
so
adapted
themselves
by
long
usage
to
her
figure
,
that
more
than
one
impatient
husband
coming
in
precipitately
,
at
about
the
time
of
twilight
,
had
been
for
an
instant
stricken
dumb
by
the
supposed
discovery
that
Mrs
Gamp
had
hanged
herself
.
 
<EOS>
One
gentleman
,
coming
on
the
usual
hasty
errand
,
had
said
indeed
,
that
they
looked
like
guardian
angels
"
watching
of
her
in
her
sleep
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
that
,
as
Mrs
Gamp
said
,
"
was
his
first
;
"
and
he
never
repeated
the
sentiment
,
though
he
often
repeated
his
visit
.
   
<EOS>
The
chairs
in
Mrs
Gamp
's
apartment
were
extremely
large
and
broad
-
backed
,
which
was
more
than
a
sufficient
reason
for
there
being
but
two
in
number
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
both
elbow
-
chairs
,
of
ancient
mahogany
;
and
were
chiefly
valuable
for
the
slippery
nature
of
their
seats
,
which
had
been
originally
horsehair
,
but
were
now
covered
with
a
shiny
substance
of
a
bluish
tint
,
from
which
the
visitor
began
to
slide
away
with
a
dismayed
countenance
,
immediately
after
sitting
down
.
 
<EOS>
What
Mrs
Gamp
wanted
in
chairs
she
made
up
in
bandboxes
;
<EOS>
of
which
she
had
a
great
collection
,
devoted
to
the
reception
of
various
miscellaneous
valuables
,
which
were
not
,
however
,
as
well
protected
as
the
good
woman
,
by
a
pleasant
fiction
,
seemed
to
think
;
for
,
though
every
bandbox
had
a
carefully
closed
lid
,
not
one
among
them
had
a
bottom
;
owing
to
which
cause
the
property
within
was
merely
,
as
it
were
,
extinguished
.
 
<EOS>
The
chest
of
drawers
having
been
originally
made
to
stand
upon
the
top
of
another
chest
,
had
a
dwarfish
,
elfin
look
,
alone
;
but
in
regard
of
its
security
it
had
a
great
advantage
over
the
bandboxes
,
for
as
all
the
handles
had
been
long
ago
pulled
off
,
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
at
its
contents
.
<EOS>
This
indeed
was
only
to
be
done
by
one
or
two
devices
;
either
by
tilting
the
whole
structure
forward
until
all
the
drawers
fell
out
together
,
or
by
opening
them
singly
with
knives
,
like
oysters
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
stored
all
her
household
matters
in
a
little
cupboard
by
the
fire
-
place
;
beginning
below
the
surface
(
as
in
nature
)
with
the
coals
,
and
mounting
gradually
upwards
to
the
spirits
,
which
,
from
motives
of
delicacy
,
she
kept
in
a
teapot
.
 
<EOS>
The
chimney
-
piece
was
ornamented
with
a
small
almanack
,
marked
here
and
there
in
Mrs
Gamp
's
own
hand
with
a
memorandum
of
the
date
at
which
some
lady
was
expected
to
fall
due
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
also
embellished
with
three
profiles
:
one
,
in
colours
,
of
Mrs
Gamp
herself
in
early
life
;
one
,
in
bronze
,
of
a
lady
in
feathers
,
supposed
to
be
Mrs
Harris
,
as
she
appeared
when
dressed
for
a
ball
;
and
one
,
in
black
,
of
Mr
Gamp
,
deceased
.
<EOS>
The
last
was
a
full
length
,
in
order
that
the
likeness
might
be
rendered
more
obvious
and
forcible
by
the
introduction
of
the
wooden
leg
.
   
<EOS>
A
pair
of
bellows
,
a
pair
of
pattens
,
a
toasting
-
fork
,
a
kettle
,
a
pap
-
boat
,
a
spoon
for
the
administration
of
medicine
to
the
refractory
,
and
lastly
,
Mrs
Gamp
's
umbrella
,
which
as
something
of
great
price
and
rarity
,
was
displayed
with
particular
ostentation
,
completed
the
decorations
of
the
chimney
-
piece
and
adjacent
wall
.
<EOS>
Towards
these
objects
Mrs
Gamp
raised
her
eyes
in
satisfaction
when
she
had
arranged
the
tea
-
board
,
and
had
concluded
her
arrangements
for
the
reception
of
Betsey
Prig
,
even
unto
the
setting
forth
of
two
pounds
of
Newcastle
salmon
,
intensely
pickled
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
Now
drat
you
,
Betsey
,
do
n't
be
long
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
apostrophizing
her
absent
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
I
ca
n't
abear
to
wait
,
I
do
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
To
wotever
place
<EOS>
I
goes
,
I
sticks
to
this
one
mortar
,
"
I
'm
easy
pleased
;
it
is
but
little
as
I
wants
;
but
I
must
have
that
little
of
the
best
,
and
to
the
minute
when
the
clock
strikes
,
else
we
do
not
part
as
I
could
wish
,
but
bearin
'
malice
in
our
arts
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Her
own
preparations
were
of
the
best
,
for
they
comprehended
a
delicate
new
loaf
,
a
plate
of
fresh
butter
,
a
basin
of
fine
white
sugar
,
and
other
arrangements
on
the
same
scale
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
snuff
with
which
she
now
refreshed
herself
,
was
so
choice
in
quality
that
she
took
a
second
pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
little
bell
a
-
ringing
now
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
hurrying
to
the
stair
-
head
and
looking
over
.
 
<EOS>
"
Betsey
Prig

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
me

"
said
the
barber
in
a
faint
voice
;
"
I
've
just
come

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
always
a

muttered
Mrs
Gamp
to
herself
,
"

<EOS>
I
ha'n't
no
patience

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
said
the
barber
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
impatiently
,
as
she
descended
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Is
the
Thames
a
-
fire
,
and
cooking
its

fish

Mr
Sweedlepipes

<EOS>
Why

<EOS>
He

"
   
<EOS>
She
added
the
latter
clause
of
inquiry
,
when
she
got
downstairs
,
and
found
him
seated
in
the
shaving
-
chair
,
pale
and
disconsolate
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

"
said
Poll
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
young

"
   
"
Not

cried
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do

young
Wilkins

If

"
It

exclaimed
the

<EOS>
"
Bailey

Why

Mrs

sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stuff

Mrs

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
n't

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
poor
Poll
,
quite
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
catch
me
up
so
short
for

when
you

<EOS>
He
'll
never

anything
again

<EOS>
He

done

<EOS>
He
's
killed

<EOS>
The

"
said
Poll
,
"
I
charged
him
too
much
for
a
red
-
poll
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
three

halfpence
for
a
penny
one
,
because
I
was
afraid
he
'd
beat
me
down

<EOS>
But
he
did

<EOS>
And
now
he
's
dead

crowd
all

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sweedlepipe
turned
aside
to
the
towel
,
and
wiped
his
eyes
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
a
clever
boy
he
was

"
<EOS>
he
said

<EOS>
"
What

<EOS>
How

<EOS>

he

know'd

<EOS>
Shaved
in
this
very
chair
he
was
;
only
for
fun

it
was
all
his

he
was
full
of
it

<EOS>
Ah

<EOS>
to
think

<EOS>
The

"
cried
the
little
barber
,
looking
round
him
at
the
cages
,
and
again
applying
to
the
towel
,
"
sooner
than
I
'd
have
heard
this
news
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
ever
come
to
hear
it
?
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
told
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
went
out
,
"
returned
the
little
barber
,
"
into
the
City
,
to
meet
a
sporting
gent
upon
the
Stock
Exchange
,
that
wanted
a
few
slow
pigeons
to
practice
at
;
and
when
I
'd
done
with
him
,
I
went
to
get
a
little
drop
of
beer
,
and
there
I
heard
everybody
a
-
talking
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
in
the
papers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
a
nice
state
of
confugion
,
Mr
Sweedlepipes
,
you
are
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
shaking
her
head
;
"
and
my
opinion
is
,
as
half
-
a
-
dudgeon
fresh
young
lively
leeches
on
your
temples
,
would
n't
be
too
much
to
clear
your
mind

which
so
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Wot
were
they
a
-
talkin
'
on
,
and
wot
was
in
the
papers
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
about
it
!
"
cried
the
barber
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
else
do
you
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
Him
and
his
master
were
upset
on
a
journey
,
and
he
was
carried
to
Salisbury
,
and
was
breathing
his
last
when
the
account
came
away
.
<EOS>
He
never
spoke
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
single
word
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
worst
of
it
to
me
;
but
that
ai
n't
all

<EOS>
His
master
ca
n't
be
found

<EOS>
The
other
manager
of
their
office
in
the
city
,
Crimple
,
David
Crimple
,
has
gone
off
with
the
money
,
and
is
advertised
for
,
with
a
reward
,
upon
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Montague
,
poor
young
Bailey
's
master
(
what
a
boy
he
was
!
)
is
advertised
for
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Some
say
he
's
slipped
off
,
to
join
his
friend
abroad
;
some
say
he
may
n't
have
got
away
yet
;
and
they
're
looking
for
him
high
and
low
.
 
<EOS>
Their
office
is
a
smash
;
a
swindle
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
's
a
Life
Assurance
office
to
a
Life
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
a
Life
Young
Bailey
's
was
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
born
into
a
wale
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
philosophical
coolness
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
he
lived
in
a
wale
;
and
he
must
take
the
consequences
of
sech
a
sitiwation
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
hear
nothink
of
Mr
Chuzzlewit
in
all
this
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Poll
,
"
nothing
to
speak
of
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
was
n't
printed
as
one
of
the
board
,
though
some
people
say
it
was
just
going
to
be
.
<EOS>
Some
believe
he
was
took
in
,
and
some
believe
he
was
one
of
the
takers
-
in
;
but
however
that
may
be
,
they
ca
n't
prove
nothing
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
he
went
up
of
his
own
accord
afore
the
Lord
Mayor
or
some
of
them
<EOS>
City
big
-
wigs
,
and
complained
that
he
'd
been
swindled
,
and
that
these
two
persons
had
gone
off
and
cheated
him
,
and
that
he
had
just
found
out
that
Montague
's
name
was
n't
even
Montague
,
but
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
do
say
that
he
looked
like
Death
,
owing
to
his
losses
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
forgive
me
,
"
cried
the
barber
,
coming
back
again
to
the
subject
of
his
individual
grief
,
"
what
's
his
looks
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
died
and
welcome
,
fifty
times
,
and
not
been
such
a
loss
as
Bailey
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
little
bell
rang
,
and
the
deep
voice
of
Mrs
Prig
struck
into
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
-
talkin
'
about
it
,
are
you
!
"
<EOS>
observed
that
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
hope
you
've
got
it
over
,
for
I
ai
n't
interested
in
it
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
precious
Betsey
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
how
late
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
worthy
Mrs
Prig
replied
,
with
some
asperity
,
"
that
if
perwerse
people
went
off
dead
,
when
they
was
least
expected
,
it
warn't
<EOS>
no
fault
of
her'n
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
further
,
"
that
it
was
quite
aggrawation
enough
to
be
made
late
when
one
was
dropping
for
one
's
tea
,
without
hearing
on
it
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
,
deriving
from
this
exhibition
of
repartee
some
clue
to
the
state
of
Mrs
Prig
's
feelings
,
instantly
conducted
her
upstairs
;
deeming
that
the
sight
of
pickled
salmon
might
work
a
softening
change
.
   
<EOS>
But
Betsey
Prig
expected
pickled
salmon
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
obvious
that
she
did
;
for
her
first
words
,
after
glancing
at
the
table
,
were
:
   
"
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
she
would
n't
have
a
cowcumber
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
changed
colour
,
and
sat
down
upon
the
bedstead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
,
Betsey
Prig
,
your
words
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
quite
forgot
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Prig
,
looking
steadfastly
at
her
friend
,
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
,
and
with
an
air
of
surly
triumph
drew
forth
either
the
oldest
of
lettuces
or
youngest
of
cabbages
,
but
at
any
rate
,
a
green
vegetable
of
an
expansive
nature
,
and
of
such
magnificent
proportions
that
she
was
obliged
to
shut
it
up
like
an
umbrella
before
she
could
pull
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
produced
a
handful
of
mustard
and
cress
,
a
trifle
of
the
herb
called
dandelion
,
three
bunches
of
radishes
,
an
onion
rather
larger
than
an
average
turnip
,
three
substantial
slices
of
beetroot
,
and
a
short
prong
or
antler
of
celery
;
the
whole
of
this
garden
-
stuff
having
been
publicly
exhibited
,
but
a
short
time
before
,
as
a
twopenny
salad
,
and
purchased
by
Mrs
Prig
on
condition
that
the
vendor
could
get
it
all
into
her
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Which
had
been
happily
accomplished
,
in
High
Holborn
,
to
the
breathless
interest
of
a
hackney
-
coach
stand
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
laid
so
little
stress
on
this
surprising
forethought
,
that
she
did
not
even
smile
,
but
returning
her
pocket
into
its
accustomed
sphere
,
merely
recommended
that
these
productions
of
nature
should
be
sliced
up
,
for
immediate
consumption
,
in
plenty
of
vinegar
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
do
n't
go
a
-
droppin
'
none
of
your
snuff
in
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Prig
.
<EOS>
"
In
gruel
,
barley
-
water
,
apple
-
tea
,
mutton
-
broth
,
and
that
,
it
do
n't
signify
.
 
<EOS>
It
stimulates
a
patient
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
relish
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Betsey
Prig
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
how
CAN
you
talk
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
ai
n't
your
patients
,
wotever
their
diseases
is
,
always
asneezin
'
<EOS>
their
wery
heads
off
,
along
of
your
snuff

"
said
Mrs
Prig
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
wot
if
they
are
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
if
they
are
,
"
said
Mrs
Prig
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
do
n't
deny
it
,
Sairah
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
deniges
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Prig
returned
no
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
WHO
deniges
of
it
,
Betsey
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
inquired
again
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mrs
Gamp
,
by
reversing
the
question
,
imparted
a
deeper
and
more
awful
character
of
solemnity
to
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
"
Betsey
,
who
deniges
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
nearest
possible
approach
to
a
very
decided
difference
of
opinion
between
these
ladies
;
but
Mrs
Prig
's
impatience
for
the
meal
being
greater
at
the
moment
than
her
impatience
of
contradiction
<EOS>
,
she
replied
,
for
the
present
,
"
<EOS>
Nobody
,
if
you
do
n't
,
Sairah
,
"
and
prepared
herself
for
tea
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
quarrel
can
be
taken
up
at
any
time
,
but
a
limited
quantity
of
salmon
can
not
.
   
<EOS>
Her
toilet
was
simple
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
merely
to
"
chuck
"
her
bonnet
and
shawl
upon
the
bed
;
give
her
hair
two
pulls
,
one
upon
the
right
side
and
one
upon
the
left
,
as
if
she
were
ringing
a
couple
of
bells
;
and
all
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
The
tea
was
already
made
,
Mrs
Gamp
was
not
long
over
the
salad
,
and
they
were
soon
at
the
height
of
their
repast
.
   
<EOS>
The
temper
of
both
parties
was
improved
,
for
the
time
being
,
by
the
enjoyments
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
meal
came
to
a
termination
(
which
it
was
pretty
long
in
doing
)
,
and
Mrs
Gamp
having
cleared
away
,
produced
the
teapot
from
the
top
shelf
,
simultaneously
with
a
couple
of
wine
-
glasses
,
they
were
quite
amiable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Betsey
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
filling
her
own
glass
and
passing
the
teapot
,
"
I
will
now
propoge
a
toast
.
 
<EOS>
My
frequent
pardner
,
Betsey
Prig
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
,
altering
the
name
to
Sairah
Gamp
;
I
drink
,
"
said
Mrs
Prig
,
"
with
love
and
tenderness
.
"
   
<EOS>
From
this
moment
symptoms
of
inflammation
began
to
lurk
in
the
nose
of
each
lady
;
and
perhaps
,
notwithstanding
all
appearances
to
the
contrary
,
in
the
temper
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sairah
,
"
said
Mrs
Prig
,
"
joining
business
with
pleasure
,
wot
is
this
case
in
which
you
wants
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
betraying
in
her
face
some
intention
of
returning
an
evasive
answer
,
Betsey
added
:
   
"
<EOS>
IS
it
Mrs
Harris
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Betsey
Prig
,
it
ai
n't
,
"
was
Mrs
Gamp
's
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mrs
Prig
,
with
a
short
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
of
that
,
at
any
rate
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
be
glad
of
that
,
Betsey
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
retorted
,
warmly
.
"
<EOS>
She
is
unbeknown
to
you
except
by
hearsay
,
why
should
you
be
glad
?
<EOS>
If
you
have
anythink
to
say
contrairy
to
the
character
of
Mrs
Harris
,
which
well
I
knows
behind
her
back
,
afore
her
face
,
or
anywheres
,
is
not
to
be
impeaged
,
out
with
it
,
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
that
sweetest
and
best
of
women
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
shedding
tears
,
"
ever
since
afore
her
First
,
which
Mr
Harris
who
was
dreadful
timid
went
and
stopped
his
ears
in
a
empty
dog
-
kennel
,
and
never
took
his
hands
away
or
come
out
once
till
he
was
showed
the
baby
<EOS>
,
wen
bein
'
took
with
fits
,
the
doctor
collared
him
and
laid
him
on
his
back
upon
the
airy
stones
,
and
she
was
told
to
ease
her
mind
,
his
owls
was
organs
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
know'd
her
,
Betsey
Prig
,
when
he
has
hurt
her
feelin
'
art
by
sayin
'
of
his
Ninth
that
it
was
one
too
many
,
if
not
two
,
while
that
dear
innocent
was
cooin
'
in
his
face
,
which
thrive
<EOS>
it
did
though
bandy
,
<EOS>
but
I
have
never
know'd
as
you
had
occagion
to
be
glad
,
Betsey
,
on
accounts
of
Mrs
Harris
not
requiring
you
.
 
<EOS>
Require
<EOS>
she
never
will
,
depend
upon
it
,
for
her
constant
words
in
sickness
is
,
and
will
be
,
"
Send
for
Sairey
?
"
<EOS>
"
   
During
this
touching
address
,
Mrs
Prig
adroitly
feigning
to
be
the
victim
of
that
absence
of
mind
which
has
its
origin
in
excessive
attention
to
one
topic
,
helped
herself
from
the
teapot
without
appearing
to
observe
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
observed
it
,
however
,
and
came
to
a
premature
close
in
consequence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
it
ai
n't
her
,
it
seems
,
"
said
Mrs
Prig
,
coldly
;
"
who
is
it
then
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
heerd
me
mention
,
Betsey
<EOS>
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
replied
,
after
glancing
in
an
expressive
and
marked
manner
at
the
tea
-
pot
,
"
a
person
as
I
took
care
on
at
the
time
as
you
and
me
was
pardners
off
and
on
,
in
that
there
fever
at
the
Bull
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Snuffey
,
"
Mrs
Prig
observed
.
   
<EOS>
Sarah
Gamp
looked
at
her
with
an
eye
of
fire
,
for
she
saw
in
this
mistake
of
Mrs
Prig
,
another
willful
and
malignant
stab
at
that
same
weakness
or
custom
of
hers
,
an
ungenerous
allusion
to
which
,
on
the
part
of
Betsey
,
had
first
disturbed
their
harmony
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
saw
it
still
more
clearly
,
when
,
politely
but
firmly
correcting
that
lady
by
the
distinct
enunciation
of
the
word
"
Chuffey
,
"
Mrs
Prig
received
the
correction
with
a
diabolical
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
The
best
among
us
have
their
failings
,
and
it
must
be
conceded
of
Mrs
Prig
,
that
if
there
were
a
blemish
in
the
goodness
of
her
disposition
,
it
was
a
habit
she
had
of
not
bestowing
all
its
sharp
and
acid
properties
upon
her
patients
(
as
a
thoroughly
amiable
woman
would
have
done
)
,
but
of
keeping
a
considerable
remainder
for
the
service
of
her
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Highly
pickled
salmon
,
and
lettuces
chopped
up
in
vinegar
,
may
,
as
viands
possessing
some
acidity
of
their
own
,
have
encouraged
and
increased
this
failing
in
Mrs
Prig
;
and
every
application
to
the
teapot
certainly
did
;
for
it
was
often
remarked
of
her
by
her
friends
,
that
she
was
most
contradictory
when
most
elevated
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
her
countenance
became
about
this
time
derisive
and
defiant
,
and
that
she
sat
with
her
arms
folded
,
and
one
eye
shut
up
,
in
a
somewhat
offensive
,
because
obstrusively
intelligent
,
manner
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
observing
this
,
felt
it
the
more
necessary
that
Mrs
Prig
should
know
her
place
,
and
be
made
sensible
of
her
exact
station
in
society
,
as
well
as
of
her
obligations
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
therefore
assumed
an
air
of
greater
patronage
and
importance
,
as
she
went
on
to
answer
Mrs
Prig
a
little
more
in
detail
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Chuffey
,
Betsey
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
is
weak
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Excuge
me
if
I
makes
remark
,
that
he
may
neither
be
so
weak
as
people
thinks
,
nor
people
may
not
think
he
is
so
weak
as
they
pretends
,
and
what
I
knows
,
I
knows
;
and
what
you
do
n't
,
you
do
n't
<EOS>
;
so
do
not
ask
me
,
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Chuffey
's
friends
has
made
propojals
for
his
bein
'
took
care
on
,
and
has
said
to
me
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
,
WILL
you
undertake
it
?
 
<EOS>
We
could
n't
think
,
"
they
says
,
"
of
trusting
him
to
nobody
<EOS>
but
you
,
for
,
Sairey
,
you
are
gold
as
has
passed
the
furnage
.
<EOS>
Will
you
undertake
it
,
at
your
own
price
,
day
and
night
,
and
by
your
own
self
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
says
,
"
I
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
reckon
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
,
"
I
says
,
but
one
creetur
in
the
world
as
I
would
undertake
on
sech
terms
,
and
her
name
is
Harris
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
"
I
says
,
"
I
am
acquainted
with
a
friend
,
whose
name
is
Betsey
Prig
,
that
I
can
recommend
,
and
will
assist
me
.
 
<EOS>
Betsey
,
"
I
says
,
"
is
always
to
be
trusted
under
me
,
and
will
be
guided
as
I
could
desire
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Prig
,
without
any
abatement
of
her
offensive
manner
again
counterfeited
abstraction
of
mind
,
and
stretched
out
her
hand
to
the
teapot
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
Mrs
Gamp
could
bear
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
the
hand
of
Mrs
Prig
with
her
own
,
and
said
,
with
great
feeling
:
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Betsey
!
 
<EOS>
Drink
fair
,
wotever
you
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Prig
,
thus
baffled
,
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
,
and
closing
the
same
eye
more
emphatically
,
and
folding
her
arms
tighter
,
suffered
her
head
to
roll
slowly
from
side
to
side
,
while
she
surveyed
her
friend
with
a
contemptuous
smile
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
resumed
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Harris
,
Betsey
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Bother
Mrs
Harris
!
"
said
Betsey
Prig
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
looked
at
her
with
amazement
,
incredulity
,
and
indignation
;
when
Mrs
Prig
,
shutting
her
eye
still
closer
,
and
folding
her
arms
still
tighter
,
uttered
these
memorable
and
tremendous
words
:
   
"
I
do
n't
believe
there
's
no
sich
a
person
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
the
utterance
of
which
expressions
,
she
leaned
forward
,
and
snapped
her
fingers
once
,
twice
,
thrice
;
each
time
nearer
to
the
face
of
Mrs
Gamp
,
and
then
rose
to
put
on
her
bonnet
,
as
one
who
felt
that
there
was
now
a
gulf
between
them
,
which
nothing
could
ever
bridge
across
.
   
<EOS>
The
shock
of
this
blow
was
so
violent
and
sudden
,
that
Mrs
Gamp
sat
staring
at
nothing
with
uplifted
eyes
,
and
her
mouth
open
as
if
she
were
gasping
for
breath
,
until
Betsey
Prig
had
put
on
her
bonnet
and
her
shawl
,
and
was
gathering
the
latter
about
her
throat
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mrs
Gamp
rose
---
morally
and
physically
rose
---
and
denounced
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
you
bage
creetur
,

I

inquired

in
her
turn

"

said
Mrs

with

ferocity

"
what
do
you
mean

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
along
with
you

"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
blush
for
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
blush
a
little
for
yourself
,
while
you
ARE
about
it

said
Mrs

<EOS>
"
You

Chuffeys

What

the
poor
old
creetur

mad

<EOS>
Aha

"
   
<EOS>
"
He
'd
very
soon
be
mad
enough
,
if
you
had
anything
to
do
with
him
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
what
I
was
wanted
for
,
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Prig
,
triumphantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
find
yourself
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
go
near
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
how
you
get
on
without
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
have
nothink

do
with
him

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
never
spoke
a
truer
word
than
that

"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
along
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
prevented
from
witnessing
the
actual
retirement
of
Mrs
Prig
from
the
room
,
notwithstanding
the
great
desire
she
had
expressed
to
behold
it
,
by
that
lady
,
in
her
angry
withdrawal
,
coming
into
contact
with
the
bedstead
,
and
bringing
down
the
previously
mentioned
pippins
;
three
or
four
of
which
came
rattling
on
the
head
of
Mrs
Gamp
so
smartly
,
that
when
she
recovered
from
this
wooden
shower
-
bath
,
Mrs
Prig
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
the
satisfaction
,
however
,
of
hearing
the
deep
voice
of
Betsey
,
proclaiming
her
injuries
and
her
determination
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
Mr
Chuffey
,
down
the
stairs
,
and
along
the
passage
,
and
even
out
in
Kingsgate
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Likewise
of
seeing
in
her
own
apartment
,
in
the
place
of
Mrs
Prig
,
Mr
Sweedlepipe
and
two
gentlemen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
little
barber
,
"
what
's
amiss
?
<EOS>
The
noise
you
ladies
have
been
making
,
Mrs
Gamp
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
these
two
gentlemen
have
been
standing
on
the
stairs
,
outside
the
door
,
nearly
all
the
time
,
trying
to
make
you
hear
,
while
you
were
pelting
away
,
hammer
and
tongs
!
 
<EOS>
It
'll
be
the
death
of
the
little
bullfinch
in
the
shop
,
that
draws
his
own
water
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
fright
,
he
's
been
a
-
straining
himself
all
to
bits
,
drawing
more
water
than
he
could
drink
in
a
twelvemonth
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
thought
it
was
Fire
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
had
in
the
meanwhile
sunk
into
her
chair
,
from
whence
,
turning
up
her
overflowing
eyes
,
and
clasping
her
hands
,
she
delivered
the
following
lamentation
:
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Sweedlepipes
,
which
Mr
Westlock

,
if
my
eyes

not

but

,
not
bein
'
used

"
---
Mrs
Gamp
,
by
the
way
,
was
pretty
far
gone
,
and
the
fragrance
of
the
teapot
was
strong
in
the
room
---
"
I
could
have
bore
it
with
a
thankful
art
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
words
she
spoke
of
Mrs
Harris
,
lambs
could
not
forgive
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Betsey
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
in
a
violent
burst
of
feeling
,
"
nor
worms
forget
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
little
barber
scratched
his
head
,
and
shook
it
,
and
looked
at
the
teapot
,
and
gradually
got
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
John
Westlock
,
taking
a
chair
,
sat
down
on
one
side
of
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
,
taking
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
supported
her
on
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
wonder
what
we
want

I

"
observed
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll

It

so

<EOS>
How

<EOS>
Better

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
shed
more
tears
,
shook
her
head
and
feebly
pronounced
Mrs
Harris
's
name
.
   
<EOS>
"

John
was
at

<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
was
prevailed
upon
to
take
a
glassful
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
condition

"
she
passionately
observed
,
"
as
Betsey

another
stroke
of
work

<EOS>
"
Certainly

said
John

<EOS>
"
She

<EOS>
"
To

said
Mrs

,
"
as

<EOS>
John
looked

Yes

"
cried
Mrs

,
trampling
on
the
floor
,
in
the
absence
of
Mrs
Prig
,
"
that
I
should
hear

You

said
John

consolingly

<EOS>
"
That

the
cutting
part

<EOS>
That

where
it

Mrs

replied
;
holding
out

unconsciously
,
while
Martin
filled
it

That

<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
as
it
ever

Mrs
Gamp
replied
,
with
a
solemnity
peculiar
to
a
certain
stage
of
intoxication
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
that

by

supposed

There

Mr

<EOS>
Who
could
repoge
in
Betsey

,
arter
her
words
of
Mrs
Harris
,
setting

that
chair
<EOS>
afore

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite

said
John

"

<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
time
to
find
another
assistant

Mrs
Gamp

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Between
her
indignation
and
the
teapot
,
her
powers
of
comprehending
what
was
said
to
her
began
to
fail
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
at
John
with
tearful
eyes
,
and
murmuring
the
well
-
remembered
name
which
Mrs
Prig
had
challenged
---
as
if
it
were
a
talisman
against
all
earthly
sorrows
---
 
seemed
to
wander
in
her
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
repeated
John
,
"
that
you
have
time
to
find
another
assistant
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
short
it
is
,
indeed
,
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
turning
up
her
languid
eyes
,
and
clasping
Mr
Westlock
's
wrist
with
matronly
affection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To

<EOS>

apinted

from

"
From
nine
to
ten

said
John
,
with
a
significant
glance
at
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
Mr
Chuffey
retires
into
safe
keeping
,
does
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
needs
to
be
kep
safe
,
I
do
assure
you
,
"
Mrs
Gamp
replied
with
a
mysterious
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Other
people
besides
me
has
had
a
happy
deliverance
from
Betsey
Prig
.
 
<EOS>
I
little
know'd
<EOS>
that
woman
.
 
<EOS>
She
'd
have
let
it
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
HIM
out
,
you
mean
,
"
said
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
severely
ironical
character
of
this
reply
was
strengthened
by
a
very
slow
nod
,
and
a
still
slower
drawing
down
of
the
corners
of
Mrs
Gamp
's
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
She
added
with
extreme
stateliness
of
manner
after
indulging
in
a
short
doze
:
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
a
-
keepin
'
of
you
gentlemen
,
and
time
is
precious
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mingling
with
that
delusion
of
the
teapot
which
inspired
her
with
the
belief
that
they
wanted
her
to
go
somewhere
immediately
,
a
shrewd
avoidance
of
any
further
reference
to
the
topics
into
which
she
had
lately
strayed
,
Mrs
Gamp
rose
;
and
putting
away
the
teapot
in
its
accustomed
place
,
and
locking
the
cupboard
with
much
gravity
proceeded
to
attire
herself
for
a
professional
visit
.
   
<EOS>
This
preparation
was
easily
made
,
as
it
required
nothing
more
than
the
snuffy
black
bonnet
,
the
snuffy
black
shawl
,
the
pattens
and
the
indispensable
umbrella
,
without
which
neither
a
lying
-
in
nor
a
laying
-
out
could
by
any
possibility
be
attempted
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mrs
Gamp
had
invested
herself
with
these
appendages
she
returned
to
her
chair
,
and
sitting
down
again
,
declared
herself
quite
ready
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
'
appiness
to
know
as
one
can
benefit
the
poor
sweet
creetur
,
"
she
observed
,
"
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
n't
all
as
can
.
 
<EOS>
The
torters
Betsey
Prig
inflicts
is
frightful
!
"
   
<EOS>
Closing
her
eyes
as
she
made
this
remark
,
in
the
acuteness
of
her
commiseration
for
Betsey
's
patients
,
she
forgot
to
open
them
again
until
she
dropped
a
patten
.
 
<EOS>
Her
nap
was
also
broken
at
intervals
like
the
fabled
slumbers
of
Friar
Bacon
,
by
the
dropping
of
the
other
patten
,
and
of
the
umbrella
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
had
got
rid
of
those
incumbrances
,
her
sleep
was
peaceful
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
young
men
looked
at
each
other
,
ludicrously
enough
;
and
Martin
,
stifling
his
disposition
to
laugh
,
whispered
in
John
Westlock
's
ear
,
   
<EOS>
"
What
shall
we
do
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
here
,
"
he
replied
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
was
heard
to
murmur
"
Mrs
Harris
"
in
her
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rely
upon
it
,
"
whispered
John
,
looking
cautiously
towards
her
,
"
that
you
shall
question
this
old
clerk
,
though
you
go
as
Mrs
Harris
herself
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
quite
enough
to
carry
her
our
own
way
now
,
at
all
events
;
thanks
to
this
quarrel
,
which
confirms
the
old
saying
that
when
rogues
fall
out
,
honest
people
get
what
they
want
.
 
<EOS>
Let
Jonas
Chuzzlewit
look
to
himself
;
and
let
her
sleep
as
long
as
she
likes
.
<EOS>
We
shall
gain
our
end
in
good
time

Tom

passed
between

<EOS>
It
was
the
next
evening
;
and
Tom
and
his
sister
were
sitting
together
before
tea
,
talking
,
in
their
usual
quiet
way
,
about
a
great
many
things

not
at
all
about
Lewsome

John

really
John
,
for
so
young
a

was
one
of
the
most
considerate
fellows
in

had
particularly
advised
Tom
not
to
mention
it
to
his
sister
just
yet
,
in
case
it
should
disquiet
her
.
 
<EOS>

And
I

n't
,
Tom
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
little
hesitation
,
"
I
would
n't
have
a
shadow
on
her
happy
face
,
or
an
uneasy
thought
in
her
gentle
heart
,
for
all
the
wealth
and
honours
of
the
universe
!
"
 
<EOS>
Really
John
was
uncommonly
kind
;
extraordinarily
kind
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
her
father
,
Tom
said
,
he
could
not
have
taken
a
greater
interest
in
her
.
   
<EOS>
But
although
Tom
and
his
sister
were
extremely
conversational
,
they
were
less
lively
,
and
less
cheerful
,
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
had
no
idea
that
this
originated
with
Ruth
,
but
took
it
for
granted
that
he
was
rather
dull
himself
.
 
<EOS>
In
truth
he
was
;
for
the
lightest
cloud
upon
the
Heaven
of
her
quiet
mind
,
cast
its
shadow
upon
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
cloud
on
little
Ruth
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
When
Tom
was
looking
in
another
direction
,
her
bright
eyes
,
stealing
on
towards
his
face
,
would
sparkle
still
more
brightly
than
their
custom
was
,
and
then
grow
dim
.
 
<EOS>
When
Tom
was
silent
,
looking
out
upon
the
summer
weather
,
she
would
sometimes
make
a
hasty
movement
,
as
if
she
were
about
to
throw
herself
upon
his
neck
;
then
check
the
impulse
,
and
when
he
looked
round
,
show
a
laughing
face
,
and
speak
to
him
very
merrily
;
when
she
had
anything
to
give
Tom
,
or
had
any
excuse
for
coming
near
him
,
she
would
flutter
about
him
,
and
lay
her
bashful
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
not
be
willing
to
withdraw
it
;
and
would
show
by
all
such
means
that
there
was
something
on
her
heart
which
in
her
great
love
she
longed
to
say
to
him
,
but
had
not
the
courage
to
utter
.
   
<EOS>
So
they
were
sitting
,
<EOS>
she
with
her
work
before
her
,
but
not
working
,
and
Tom
with
his
book
beside
him
,
but
not
reading
,
when
Martin
knocked
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Anticipating
who
it
was
,
Tom
went
to
open
it
;
and
he
and
Martin
came
back
into
the
room
together
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
looked
surprised
,
for
in
answer
to
his
cordial
greeting
<EOS>
Martin
had
hardly
spoken
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
Ruth
also
saw
that
there
was
something
strange
in
the
manner
of
their
visitor
,
and
raised
her
eyes
inquiringly
to
Tom
's
face
,
as
if
she
were
seeking
an
explanation
there
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
shook
his
head
,
and
made
the
same
mute
appeal
to
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
Martin
did
not
sit
down
but
walked
up
to
the
window
,
and
stood
there
looking
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
round
after
a
few
moments
to
speak
,
but
hastily
averted
his
head
again
,
without
doing
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
,
Martin
?
<EOS>
"
Tom
anxiously
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
what
bad
news
do
you
bring
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
!
"
replied
Martin
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
hear
you
feign
that
interest
in
anything
that
happens
to
me
,
hurts
me
even
more
than
your
ungenerous
dealing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
ungenerous
dealing
!
 
<EOS>
Martin
!
 
<EOS>
My
---
"
 
Tom
could
say
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
could
you
,
Tom
,
how
could
you
suffer
me
to
thank
you
so
fervently
and
sincerely
for
your
friendship
;
and
not
tell
me
,
like
a
man
,
that
you
had
deserted
me
!
 
<EOS>
Was
it
true
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
Was
it
honest
!
 
<EOS>
Was
it
worthy
of
what
you
used
to
be
---
of
what
I
am
sure
you
used
to
be
---
 
to
tempt
me
,
when
you
had
turned
against
me
,
into
pouring
out
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
tone
was
one
of
such
strong
injury
and
yet
of
so
much
grief
for
the
loss
of
a
friend
he
had
trusted
in
---
it
expressed
such
high
past
love
for
Tom
,
and
so
much
sorrow
and
compassion
for
his
supposed
unworthiness
---
that
Tom
,
for
a
moment
,
put
his
hand
before
his
face
,
and
had
no
more
power
of
justifying
himself
,
than
if
he
had
been
a
monster
of
deceit
and
falsehood
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
protest
,
as
I
must
die
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
that
I
grieve
over
the
loss
of
what
I
thought
you
;
and
have
no
anger
in
the
recollection
of
my
own
injuries
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
only
at
such
a
time
,
and
after
such
a
discovery
,
that
we
know
the
full
measure
of
our
old
regard
for
the
subject
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
swear
,
little
as
I
showed
it
---
<EOS>
little
as
I
know
<EOS>
I
showed
it
---
that
when
I
had
the
least
consideration
for
you
,
Tom
,
I
loved
you
like
a
brother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
composed
by
this
time
,
and
might
have
been
the
Spirit
of
Truth
,
in
a
homely
dress
---
it
very
often
wears
a
homely
dress
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
when
he
replied
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martin
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
is
in
your
mind
,
or
who
has
abused
it
,
or
by
what
extraordinary
means
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
means
are
false
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
truth
whatever
in
the
impression
under
which
you
labour
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
delusion
from
first
to
last
;
and
I
warn
you
that
you
will
deeply
regret
the
wrong
you
do
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
have
been
true
to
you
,
and
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
very
sorry
for
this
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
you
will
be
very
sorry
for
it
,
Martin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
AM
sorry
,
"
returned
Martin
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
sorry
in
my
heart
,
until
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
if
I
had
always
been
what
you
charge
me
with
being
now
,
and
had
never
had
a
place
in
your
regard
,
but
had
always
been
despised
by
you
,
and
had
always
deserved
it
,
you
should
tell
me
in
what
you
have
found
me
to
be
treacherous
;
and
on
what
grounds
you
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
intreat
you
,
therefore
,
to
give
me
that
satisfaction
as
a
favour
,
Martin
,
but
I
ask
it
of
you
as
a
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
own
eyes
are
my
witnesses
,
"
returned
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
believe
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
,
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
if
they
accuse
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
own
words
.
 
<EOS>
Your
own
manner

pursued
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
believe
THEM
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Tom
,
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
if
they
accuse
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
never
have
accused
me
.
 
<EOS>
Whoever
has
perverted
them
to
such
a
purpose
,
has
wronged
me
almost
as
cruelly
"
---
his
calmness
rather
failed
him
here
---
 
"
as
you
have
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
here
,
"
said
Martin
;
"
and
I
appeal
to
your
good
sister
to
hear
me
---
"
   
"
Not
to
her
,
"
interrupted
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
do
not
appeal
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
never
believe
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
drew
her
arm
through
his
own
,
as
he
said
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
,
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
cried
Tom
,
"
<EOS>
of
course
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
so
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
tut
,
tut
,
tut
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
silly
little
thing
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
meant
,
"
said
Martin
,
hastily
,
"
to
appeal
to
you
against
your
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
think
me
so
unmanly
and
unkind
.
 
<EOS>
I
merely
appealed
to
you
to
hear
my
declaration
,
that
I
came
here
for
no
purpose
of
reproach
---
I
have
not
one
reproach
to
vent
---
but
in
deep
regret
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
not
know
in
what
bitterness
of
regret
,
unless
you
knew
how
often
I
have
thought
of
Tom
;
how
long
in
almost
hopeless
circumstances
,
I
have
looked
forward
to
the
better
estimation
of
his
friendship
;
and
how
steadfastly
I
have
believed
and
trusted
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
"
said
Tom
,
stopping
her
as
she
was
about
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
you
mind
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
sure
to
be
set
right
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
bless
the
day
that
sets
me
right
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
"
if
it
could
ever
come
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
it
will
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
paused
,
and
then
said
in
a
still
milder
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
chosen
for
yourself
,
Tom
,
and
will
be
relieved
by
our
parting
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
an
angry
one
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
anger
on
my
side
---
"
   
"
There
is
none
on
mine
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
It
is
merely
what
you
have
brought
about
,
and
worked
to
bring
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
you
have
chosen
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
made
the
choice
that
might
have
been
expected
in
most
people
situated
as
you
are
,
but
which
I
did
not
expect
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
For
that
,
perhaps
,
I
should
blame
my
own
judgment
more
than
you
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
wealth
and
favour
worth
having
,
on
one
side
;
and
there
is
the
worthless
friendship
of
an
abandoned
,
struggling
fellow
,
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
free
to
make
your
election
,
and
you
made
it
;
and
the
choice
was
not
difficult
.
 
<EOS>
But
those
who
have
not
the
courage
to
resist
such
temptations
,
should
have
the
courage
to
avow
what
they
have
yielded
to
them
;
and
I
DO
blame
you
for
this
,
Tom
:
that
you
received
me
with
a
show
of
warmth
,
encouraged
me
to
be
frank
and
plain
-
spoken
,
tempted
me
to
confide
in
you
,
and
professed
that
you
were
able
to
be
mine
;
when
you
had
sold
yourself
to
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
,
"
said
Martin
,
with
emotion
<EOS>
---
"
hear
me
say
it
from
my
heart
---
I
CANNOT
believe
,
<EOS>
Tom
,
now
that
I
am
standing
face
to
face
with
you
,
that
it
would
have
been
in
your
nature
to
do
me
any
serious
harm
,
even
though
I
had
not
discovered
,
by
chance
,
in
whose
employment
you
were
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
should
have
encumbered
you
;
I
should
have
led
you
into
more
double
-
dealing
;
I
should
have
hazarded
your
retaining
the
favour
for
which
you
have
paid
so
high
a
price
,
bartering
away
your
former
self
;
and
it
is
best
for
both
of
us
that
I
have
found
out
what
you
so
much
desired
to
keep
secret
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
just
,
"
said
Tom
;
who
,
had
not
removed
his
mild
gaze
from
Martin
's
face
since
the
commencement
of
this
last
address
;
"
be
just
even
in
your
injustice
,
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
You
forget
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
yet
told
me
what
your
accusation
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
?
"
returned
Martin
,
waving
his
hand
,
and
moving
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
know
it
the
better
for
my
dwelling
on
it
,
and
though
it
would
be
really
none
the
worse
,
it
might
seem
to
me
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Bygones
shall
be
bygones
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
take
leave
of
you
at
this
moment
,
and
in
this
place
---
in
which
you
are
so
amiable
and
so
good
---
as
heartily
,
if
not
as
cheerfully
,
as
ever
I
have
done
since
we
first
met
.
 
<EOS>
All
good
go
with
you
,
Tom
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
You
leave
me
so
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
leave
me
so
<EOS>
,
can
you
?
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
you
---
you
have
chosen
for
yourself
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
hope
it
was
a
rash
choice
,
"
Martin
faltered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
was
!
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
he
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
led
his
little
sister
to
her
chair
,
and
sat
down
in
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
his
book
,
and
read
,
or
seemed
to
read
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
he
said
aloud
,
turning
a
leaf
as
he
spoke
:
"
He
will
be
very
sorry
for
this
.
"
<EOS>
And
a
tear
stole
down
his
face
,
and
dropped
upon
the
page
.
   
<EOS>
Ruth
nestled
down
beside
him
on
her
knees
,
and
clasped
her
arms
about
his
neck
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Be
comforted
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
---
comforted
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
set
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
a
cruel
,
bad
return
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ruth
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
believes
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
why
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
will
be
set
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
More
closely
<EOS>
yet
,
she
nestled
down
about
him
;
and
wept
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
hide
your
face
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
Then
in
a
burst
of
tears
,
it
all
broke
out
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
Tom
,
dear
Tom
,
I
know
your
secret
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
found
it
out
;
you
could
n't
hide
the
truth
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
could
have
made
you
happier
,
if
you
had
!
 
<EOS>
You
love
her
,
Tom
,
so
dearly
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
made
a
motion
with
his
hand
as
if
he
would
have
put
his
sister
hurriedly
away
;
but
it
clasped
upon
hers
,
and
all
his
little
history
was
written
in
the
action
.
 
<EOS>
All
its
pathetic
eloquence
was
in
the
silent
touch
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
spite
of
that
,
"
said
Ruth
,
"
you
have
been
so
faithful
and
so
good
,
dear
;
in
spite
of
that
,
you
have
been
so
true
and
self
-
denying
,
and
have
struggled
with
yourself
;
in
spite
of
that
,
you
have
been
so
gentle
,
and
so
kind
,
and
even
-
tempered
,
that
I
have
never
seen
you
give
a
hasty
look
,
or
heard
you
say
one
irritable
word
.
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
,
you
have
been
so
cruelly
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
Tom
,
dear
Tom
,
will
THIS
be
set
right
too
!
 
<EOS>
Will
it
,
Tom
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
always
have
this
sorrow
in
your
breast
;
you
who
deserve
to
be
so
happy
;
or
is
there
any
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
And
still
she
hid
her
face
from
Tom
,
and
clasped
him
round
the
neck
,
and
wept
for
him
,
and
poured
out
all
her
woman
's
heart
and
soul
in
the
relief
and
pain
of
this
disclosure
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
before
she
and
Tom
were
sitting
side
by
side
,
and
she
was
looking
with
an
earnest
quietness
in
Tom
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Tom
spoke
to
her
thus
,
cheerily
,
though
gravely
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
,
my
dear
,
that
this
has
passed
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
Not
because
it
assures
me
of
your
tender
affection
(
for
I
was
well
assured
of
that
before
)
,
but
because
it
relieves
my
mind
of
a
great
weight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
's
eyes
glistened
when
he
spoke
of
her
affection
;
and
he
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
with
whatever
feeling
I
regard
her
"
---
they
seemed
to
avoid
the
name
by
mutual
consent
---
"
I
have
long
ago
---
I
am
sure
I
may
say
from
the
very
first
---
looked
upon
it
as
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
As
something
that
might
possibly
have
happened
under
very
different
circumstances
,
but
which
can
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
you
have
set
right
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
gave
Tom
such
a
significant
little
look
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
take
it
for
an
answer
whether
he
would
or
no
;
and
to
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
her
own
choice
and
free
consent
,
my
love
,
she
is
betrothed
to
Martin
;
and
was
,
long
before
either
of
them
knew
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
her
betrothed
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
rejoined
Tom
,
"
but
that
might
be
setting
it
wrong
,
instead
of
right
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
grave
smile
,
"
that
even
if
she
had
never
seen
him
,
it
is
very
likely
she
would
have
fallen
in
love
with
Me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
dear
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
shook
his
head
,
and
smiled
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
of
me
,
Ruth
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
and
it
is
very
natural
that
you
should
,
as
if
I
were
a
character
in
a
book
;
and
you
make
it
a
sort
of
poetical
justice
that
I
should
,
by
some
impossible
means
or
other
,
come
,
at
last
,
to
marry
the
person
I
love
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
much
higher
justice
than
poetical
justice
,
my
dear
,
and
it
does
not
order
events
upon
the
same
principle
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
people
who
read
about
heroes
in
books
,
and
choose
to
make
heroes
of
themselves
out
of
books
,
consider
it
a
very
fine
thing
to
be
discontented
and
gloomy
,
and
misanthropical
,
and
perhaps
a
little
blasphemous
,
because
they
can
not
have
everything
ordered
for
their
individual
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
like
me
to
become
one
of
that
sort
of
people
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
I
know
,
"
she
added
timidly
,
"
that
this
is
a
sorrow
to
you
in
your
own
better
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
thought
of
disputing
the
position
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
would
have
been
mere
folly
,
and
he
gave
it
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
I
will
repay
your
affection
with
the
Truth
and
all
the
Truth
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
sorrow
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
proved
it
to
be
<EOS>
so
sometimes
,
though
I
have
always
striven
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
somebody
who
is
precious
to
you
may
die
,
and
you
may
dream
that
you
are
in
heaven
with
the
departed
spirit
,
and
you
may
find
it
a
sorrow
to
wake
to
the
life
on
earth
,
which
is
no
harder
to
be
borne
than
when
you
fell
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
sorrowful
to
me
to
contemplate
my
dream
which
I
always
knew
was
a
dream
,
even
when
it
first
presented
itself
;
but
the
realities
about
me
are
not
to
blame
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
the
same
as
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
My
sister
,
my
sweet
companion
,
who
makes
this
place
<EOS>
so
dear
,
is
she
less
devoted
to
me
,
Ruth
,
than
she
would
have
been
,
if
this
vision
had
never
troubled
me
?
 
<EOS>
My
old
friend
John
,
who
might
so
easily
have
treated
me
with
coldness
and
neglect
,
is
he
less
cordial
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
The
world
about
me
,
is
there
less
good
in
that
?
<EOS>
Are
my
words
to
be
harsh
and
my
looks
to
be
sour
,
and
is
my
heart
to
grow
cold
,
because
there
has
fallen
in
my
way
a
good
and
beautiful
creature
,
who
but
for
the
selfish
regret
that
I
can
not
call
her
my
own
,
would
,
like
all
other
good
and
beautiful
creatures
,
make
me
happier
and
better
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
sister
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
Tom
stoutly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remembering
all
my
means
of
happiness
,
I
hardly
dare
to
call
this
lurking
something
a
sorrow
;
but
whatever
name
it
may
justly
bear
,
I
thank
Heaven
that
it
renders
me
more
sensible
of
affection
and
attachment
,
and
softens
me
in
fifty
ways
.
 
<EOS>
Not
less
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Not
less
happy
,
Ruth
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
to
him
,
but
she
loved
him
,
as
he
well
deserved
.
<EOS>
Even
as
he
deserved
,
she
loved
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
will
open
Martin
's
eyes
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
glow
of
pride
,
"
and
that
(
which
is
indeed
wrong
)
will
be
set
right
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
will
persuade
her
,
I
know
,
that
I
have
betrayed
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
set
right
through
her
,
and
he
will
be
very
sorry
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Our
secret
,
Ruth
,
is
our
own
,
and
lives
and
dies
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
I
ever
could
have
told
it
you
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
smile
,
"
but
how
glad
I
am
to
think
you
have
found
it
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
had
never
taken
such
a
pleasant
walk
as
they
took
that
night
.
<EOS>
Tom
told
her
all
so
freely
and
so
simply
,
and
was
so
desirous
to
return
her
tenderness
with
his
fullest
confidence
,
that
they
prolonged
it
far
beyond
their
usual
hour
,
and
sat
up
late
when
they
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
they
parted
for
the
night
there
was
such
a
tranquil
,
beautiful
expression
in
Tom
's
face
,
that
she
could
not
bear
to
shut
it
out
,
but
going
back
on
tiptoe
to
his
chamber
-
door
,
looked
in
and
stood
there
till
he
saw
her
,
and
then
embracing
him
again
,
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
her
prayers
and
in
her
sleep
---
good
times
to
be
remembered
with
such
fervour
,
Tom
!
---
his
name
was
uppermost
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
was
left
alone
,
Tom
pondered
very
much
on
this
discovery
of
hers
,
and
greatly
wondered
what
had
led
her
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
thought
Tom
,
"
I
have
been
so
very
careful
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
foolish
and
unnecessary
in
me
,
as
I
clearly
see
now
,
when
I
am
so
relieved
by
her
knowing
it
;
but
I
have
been
so
very
careful
to
conceal
it
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
knew
that
she
was
intelligent
and
quick
,
and
for
that
reason
was
more
upon
my
guard
;
but
I
was
not
in
the
least
prepared
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
her
discovery
has
been
sudden
too
.
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
most
singular
instance
of
penetration
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
There
it
was
,
when
his
head
was
on
his
pillow
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
she
trembled
when
she
began
to
tell
me
she
knew
it
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Tom
,
recalling
all
the
little
incidents
and
circumstances
;
"
and
how
her
face
flushed
!
 
<EOS>
But
that
was
natural
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
quite
natural
!
 
<EOS>
That
needs
no
accounting
for
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
little
thought
how
natural
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
little
knew
that
there
was
that
in
Ruth
's
own
heart
,
but
newly
set
there
,
which
had
helped
her
to
the
reading
of
his
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
understand
the
whispers
of
the
Temple
Fountain
,
though
he
passed
it
every
day
.
   
<EOS>
Who
so
lively
and
cheerful
as
busy
Ruth
next
morning
!
 
<EOS>
Her
early
tap
at
Tom
's
door
,
and
her
light
foot
outside
,
would
have
been
music
to
him
though
she
had
not
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
said
it
was
the
brightest
morning
ever
seen
;
and
so
it
was
;
<EOS>
and
if
it
had
been
otherwise
,
she
would
have
made
it
so
to
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
ready
with
his
neat
breakfast
when
he
went
downstairs
,
and
had
her
bonnet
ready
for
the
early
walk
,
and
was
so
full
of
news
,
that
Tom
was
lost
in
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
have
been
up
all
night
,
collecting
it
for
his
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Mr
Nadgett
not
come
home
yet
,
and
there
was
bread
down
a
penny
a
loaf
,
and
there
was
twice
as
much
strength
in
this
tea
as
in
the
last
,
and
the
milk
-
woman
's
husband
had
come
out
of
the
hospital
cured
,
and
the
curly
-
headed
child
over
the
way
had
been
lost
all
yesterday
,
and
she
was
going
to
make
all
sorts
of
preserves
in
a
desperate
hurry
,
and
there
happened
to
be
a
saucepan
in
the
house
which
was
the
very
saucepan
for
the
purpose
;
and
she
knew
all
about
the
last
book
Tom
had
brought
home
,
all
through
,
though
it
was
a
teaser
to
read
;
and
she
had
so
much
to
tell
him
that
she
had
finished
breakfast
first
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
had
her
little
bonnet
on
,
and
the
tea
and
sugar
locked
up
,
and
the
keys
in
her
reticule
,
and
the
flower
,
as
usual
,
in
Tom
's
coat
,
and
was
in
all
respects
quite
ready
to
accompany
him
,
before
Tom
knew
she
had
begun
to
prepare
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
short
,
as
Tom
said
,
with
a
confidence
in
his
own
assertion
which
amounted
to
a
defiance
of
the
public
in
general
,
there
never
was
such
a
little
woman
.
   
<EOS>
She
made
Tom
talkative
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
resist
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
such
enticing
questions
to
him
;
about
books
,
and
about
dates
of
churches
,
and
about
organs
and
about
the
Temple
,
and
about
all
kinds
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
lightened
the
way
(
and
Tom
's
heart
with
it
)
to
that
degree
,
that
the
Temple
looked
quite
blank
and
solitary
when
he
parted
from
her
at
the
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
Mr
Fips
's
friend
to
-
day
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
thought
Tom
,
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
Not
yet
,
at
any
rate
,
for
the
door
was
closed
as
usual
,
and
Tom
opened
it
with
his
key
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
got
the
books
into
perfect
order
now
,
and
had
mended
the
torn
leaves
,
and
had
pasted
up
the
broken
backs
,
and
substituted
neat
labels
for
the
worn
-
out
letterings
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
a
different
place
,
it
was
so
orderly
and
neat
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
felt
some
pride
in
comtemplating
the
change
he
had
wrought
,
though
there
was
no
one
to
approve
or
disapprove
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
at
present
occupied
in
making
a
fair
copy
of
his
draught
of
the
catalogue
;
on
which
,
as
there
was
no
hurry
,
he
was
painfully
concentrating
all
the
ingenious
and
laborious
neatness
he
had
ever
expended
on
map
or
plan
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
workroom
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
marvel
of
a
catalogue
;
for
Tom
sometimes
thought
he
was
really
getting
his
money
too
easily
,
and
he
had
determined
within
himself
that
this
document
should
take
a
little
of
his
superfluous
leisure
out
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
So
with
pens
and
ruler
,
and
compasses
and
india
-
rubber
,
and
pencil
,
and
black
ink
,
and
red
ink
,
Tom
worked
away
all
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
a
good
deal
about
Martin
,
and
their
interview
of
yesterday
,
and
would
have
been
far
easier
in
his
mind
if
he
could
have
resolved
to
confide
it
to
his
friend
John
,
and
to
have
taken
his
opinion
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
But
besides
that
he
knew
what
John
's
boiling
indignation
would
be
,
he
bethought
himself
that
he
was
helping
Martin
now
in
a
matter
of
great
moment
,
and
that
to
deprive
the
latter
of
his
assistance
at
such
a
crisis
of
affairs
,
would
be
to
inflict
a
serious
injury
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
'll
keep
it
to
myself
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
keep
it
to
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
to
work
he
went
again
,
more
assiduously
than
ever
,
with
the
pens
,
and
the
ruler
,
and
the
india
-
rubber
,
and
the
pencils
,
and
the
red
ink
,
that
he
might
forget
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
laboured
away
another
hour
or
more
,
when
he
heard
a
footstep
in
the
entry
,
down
below
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
looking
towards
the
door
;
"
time
was
,
not
long
ago
either
,
when
that
would
have
set
me
wondering
and
expecting
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
left
off
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
footstep
came
on
,
up
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thirty
-
six
,
thirty
-
seven
,
thirty
-
eight
,
"
said
Tom
,
counting
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
you
'll
stop
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
ever
comes
past
the
thirty
-
eighth
stair
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
person
did
,
certainly
,
but
only
to
take
breath
;
for
up
the
footstep
came
again
.
 
<EOS>
Forty
,
forty
-
one
,
forty
-
two
,
and
so
on
.
   
<EOS>
The
door
stood
open
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
tread
advanced
,
Tom
looked
impatiently
and
eagerly
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
figure
came
upon
the
landing
,
and
arriving
in
the
doorway
,
stopped
and
gazed
at
him
,
he
rose
up
from
his
chair
,
and
half
believed
he
saw
a
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
Chuzzlewit
!
 
<EOS>
The
same
whom
he
had
left
at
Mr
Pecksniff
's
,
weak
and
sinking
!
   
<EOS>
The
same
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
not
the
same
,
for
this
old
man
,
though
old
,
was
strong
,
and
leaned
upon
his
stick
with
a
vigorous
hand
,
while
with
the
other
he
signed
to
Tom
to
make
no
noise
.
 
<EOS>
One
glance
at
the
resolute
face
,
the
watchful
eye
,
the
vigorous
hand
upon
the
staff
,
the
triumphant
purpose
in
the
figure
,
and
such
a
light
broke
in
on
Tom
as
blinded
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
expected
me
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
told
that
my
employer
would
arrive
soon
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
"
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
ignorant
who
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
my
desire
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
it
has
been
so
well
observed
.
 
<EOS>
I
intended
to
have
been
with
you
much
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
the
time
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
could
know
no
more
,
and
no
worse
,
of
him
,
than
I
did
on
that
day
when
I
saw
you
last
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
wrong
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
by
this
time
come
up
to
Tom
,
and
now
he
grasped
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
lived
in
his
house
,
Pinch
,
and
had
him
fawning
on
me
days
and
weeks
and
months
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
him
to
treat
me
like
his
tool
and
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
;
you
have
seen
me
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
undergone
ten
thousand
times
as
much
as
I
could
have
endured
if
I
had
been
the
miserable
weak
old
man
he
took
me
for
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
offer
love
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
;
<EOS>
who
better
---
 
<EOS>
who
better
,
my
true
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
his
base
soul
bare
before
me
,
day
by
day
,
and
have
not
betrayed
myself
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
undergone
such
torture
but
for
looking
forward
to
this
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
even
in
the
passion
of
his
speech
---
if
that
can
be
called
passion
which
was
so
resolute
and
steady
---
to
press
Tom
's
hand
again
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
in
great
excitement
:
   
<EOS>
"
Close
the
door
,
close
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
not
be
long
after
me
,
but
may
come
too
soon
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
now
drawing
on
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
hurriedly
---
his
eyes
and
whole
face
brightening
as
he
spoke
<EOS>
---
"
will
make
amends
for
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
him
die
or
hang
himself
,
for
millions
of
golden
pieces
!
 
<EOS>
Close
the
door
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
did
so
;
hardly
knowing
yet
whether
he
was
awake
or
in
a
dream
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
51
.
<EOS>
Sheds
new
and
brighter
light
upon
the
very
dark
place
;
and
contains
the
sequel
of
the
enterprise
of
Mr
Jonas
and
his
friend
 
<EOS>
The
night
had
now
come
,
when
the
old
clerk
was
to
be
delivered
over
to
his
keepers
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
his
guilty
distractions
,
Jonas
had
not
forgotten
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
part
of
his
guilty
state
of
mind
to
remember
it
;
for
on
his
persistence
in
the
scheme
depended
one
of
his
precautions
for
his
own
safety
.
 
<EOS>
A
hint
,
a
word
,
from
the
old
man
,
uttered
at
such
a
moment
in
attentive
ears
,
might
fire
the
train
of
suspicion
,
and
destroy
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
watchfulness
of
every
avenue
by
which
the
discovery
of
his
guilt
might
be
approached
,
sharpened
with
his
sense
of
the
danger
by
which
he
was
encompassed
.
 
<EOS>
With
murder
on
his
soul
,
and
its
innumerable
alarms
and
terrors
dragging
at
him
night
and
day
,
he
would
have
repeated
the
crime
,
if
he
had
seen
a
path
of
safety
stretching
out
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
his
punishment
;
it
was
in
his
guilty
condition
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
deed
which
his
fears
rendered
insupportable
,
his
fears
would
have
impelled
him
to
commit
again
.
   
<EOS>
But
keeping
the
old
man
close
,
according
to
his
design
,
would
serve
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
His
purpose
was
to
escape
,
when
the
first
alarm
and
wonder
had
subsided
;
and
when
he
could
make
the
attempt
without
awakening
instant
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
these
women
would
keep
him
quiet
;
and
if
the
talking
humour
came
upon
him
,
would
not
be
easily
startled
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
their
trade
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
had
he
spoken
idly
when
he
said
the
old
man
should
be
gagged
.
<EOS>
He
had
resolved
to
ensure
his
silence
;
and
he
looked
to
the
end
,
not
the
means
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
rough
and
rude
and
cruel
to
the
old
man
all
his
life
;
and
violence
was
natural
to
his
mind
in
connection
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
gagged
if
he
speaks
,
and
pinioned
if
he
writes
,
"
said
Jonas
,
looking
at
him
;
for
they
sat
alone
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
mad
enough
for
that
;
I
'll
go
through
with
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Hush
!
   
<EOS>
Still
listening
!
 
<EOS>
To
every
sound
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
listened
ever
since
,
and
it
had
not
come
yet
.
 
<EOS>
The
exposure
of
the
Assurance
office
;
the
flight
of
Crimple
and
Bullamy
with
the
plunder
,
and
among
the
rest
,
as
he
feared
,
with
his
own
bill
,
which
he
had
not
found
in
the
pocket
-
book
of
the
murdered
man
,
and
which
with
Mr
Pecksniff
's
money
had
probably
been
remitted
to
one
or
other
of
those
trusty
friends
for
safe
deposit
at
the
banker
's
;
his
immense
losses
,
and
peril
of
being
still
called
to
account
as
a
partner
in
the
broken
firm
;
all
these
things
rose
in
his
mind
at
one
time
and
always
,
but
he
could
not
contemplate
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
aware
of
their
presence
,
and
of
the
rage
,
discomfiture
,
and
despair
,
they
brought
along
with
them
;
but
he
thought
---
of
his
own
controlling
power
and
direction
he
thought
---
of
the
one
dread
question
only
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
would
find
the
body
in
the
wood
.
   
<EOS>
He
tried
---
he
had
never
left
off
trying
---
not
to
forget
it
was
there
,
for
that
was
impossible
,
but
to
forget
to
weary
himself
by
drawing
vivid
pictures
of
it
in
his
fancy
;
by
going
softly
about
it
and
about
it
among
the
leaves
,
approaching
it
nearer
and
nearer
through
a
gap
in
the
boughs
,
and
startling
the
very
flies
that
were
thickly
sprinkled
all
over
it
,
like
heaps
of
dried
currants
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
was
fixed
and
fastened
on
the
discovery
,
for
intelligence
of
which
he
listened
intently
to
every
cry
and
shout
;
listened
when
any
one
came
in
or
went
out
;
watched
from
the
window
the
people
who
passed
up
and
down
the
street
;
mistrusted
his
own
looks
and
words
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
more
his
thoughts
were
set
upon
the
discovery
,
the
stronger
was
the
fascination
which
attracted
them
to
the
thing
itself
;
lying
alone
in
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
for
ever
showing
and
presenting
it
,
as
it
were
,
to
every
creature
whom
he
saw
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
here
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
of
this
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
found
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
suspect
ME
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
condemned
to
bear
the
body
in
his
arms
,
and
lay
it
down
for
recognition
at
the
feet
of
every
one
he
met
,
it
could
not
have
been
more
constantly
with
him
,
or
a
cause
of
more
monotonous
and
dismal
occupation
than
it
was
in
this
state
of
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Still
he
was
not
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
contrition
or
remorse
for
what
he
had
done
that
moved
him
;
it
was
nothing
but
alarm
for
his
own
security
.
 
<EOS>
The
vague
consciousness
he
possessed
of
having
wrecked
his
fortune
in
the
murderous
venture
,
intensified
his
hatred
and
revenge
,
and
made
him
set
the
greater
store
by
what
he
had
gained
The
man
was
dead
;
nothing
could
undo
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
a
triumph
yet
,
in
the
reflection
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
kept
a
jealous
watch
on
Chuffey
ever
since
the
deed
;
seldom
leaving
him
but
on
compulsion
,
and
then
for
as
short
intervals
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
alone
together
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
twilight
,
and
the
appointed
time
drew
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
walked
up
and
down
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
sat
in
his
accustomed
corner
.
   
<EOS>
The
slightest
circumstance
was
matter
of
disquiet
to
the
murderer
,
and
he
was
made
uneasy
at
this
time
by
the
absence
of
his
wife
,
who
had
left
home
early
in
the
afternoon
,
and
had
not
returned
yet
.
 
<EOS>
No
tenderness
for
her
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
;
but
he
had
a
misgiving
that
she
might
have
been
waylaid
,
and
tempted
into
saying
something
that
would
criminate
him
when
the
news
came
.
 
<EOS>
For
anything
he
knew
,
she
might
have
knocked
at
the
door
of
his
room
,
while
he
was
away
,
and
discovered
his
plot
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
her
,
it
was
like
her
pale
face
to
be
wandering
up
and
down
the
house
!
 
<EOS>
Where
was
she
now
?
   
<EOS>
"
She
went
to
her
good
friend
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
when
he
asked
the
question
with
an
angry
oath
.
   
<EOS>
Aye
!
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Always
stealing
away
into
the
company
of
that
woman
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
no
friend
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Who
could
tell
what
devil
's
mischief
they
might
hatch
together
!
 
<EOS>
Let
her
be
fetched
home
directly
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
muttering
some
words
softly
,
rose
as
if
he
would
have
gone
himself
,
but
Jonas
thrust
him
back
into
his
chair
with
an
impatient
imprecation
,
and
sent
a
servant
-
girl
to
fetch
her
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
charged
her
with
her
errand
he
walked
to
and
fro
again
,
and
never
stopped
till
she
came
back
,
<EOS>
which
she
did
pretty
soon
;
the
way
being
short
,
and
the
woman
having
made
good
haste
.
   
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Where
was
she
?
 
<EOS>
Had
she
come
?
   
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
left
there
,
full
three
hours
.
   
<EOS>
"
Left
there
!
 
<EOS>
Alone
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
messenger
had
not
asked
;
taking
that
for
granted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Curse
you
for
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
candles
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
scarcely
left
the
room
when
the
old
clerk
,
who
had
been
unusually
observant
of
him
ever
since
he
had
asked
about
his
wife
,
came
suddenly
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
her
up
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Give
her
up
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
you
have
done
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
no
promises
on
that
score
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
you
have
done
with
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
laid
his
hands
upon
his
collar
as
he
spoke
,
and
grasped
it
;
tightly
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
leave
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
strong
enough
to
cry
out
to
the
neighbours
,
and
I
will
,
unless
you
give
her
up
.
 
<EOS>
Give
her
up
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
was
so
dismayed
and
conscience
-
stricken
,
that
he
had
not
even
hardihood
enough
to
unclench
the
old
man
's
hands
with
his
own
;
but
stood
looking
at
him
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
darkness
,
without
moving
a
finger
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
ask
him
what
he
meant
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
know
what
you
have
done
with
her
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
hurt
a
hair
of
her
head
,
you
shall
answer
it
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Where
is
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
old
madman
!
"
said
Jonas
,
in
a
low
voice
,
and
with
trembling
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
Bedlam
fit
has
come
upon
you
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
to
make
me
mad
,
seeing
what
I
have
seen
in
this
house
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
my
dear
old
master
!
 
<EOS>
Where
is
his
only
son
that
I
have
nursed
upon
my
knee
,
a
child
!
 
<EOS>
Where
is
she
,
she
who
was
the
last
;
she
that
I
've
seen
pining
day
by
day
,
and
heard
weeping
in
the
dead
of
night
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
the
last
,
the
last
of
all
my
friends
!
 
<EOS>
Heaven
help
me
,
she
was
the
very
last
!
"
   
<EOS>
Seeing
that
the
tears
were
stealing
down
his
face
,
Jonas
mustered
courage
to
unclench
his
hands
,
and
push
him
off
before
he
answered
:
   
"
Did
you
hear
me
ask
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
hear
me
send
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
give
you
up
what
I
have
n't
got
,
idiot
!
 
<EOS>
Ecod
,
I
'd
give
her
up
to
you
and
welcome
,
if
I
could
;
and
a
precious
pair
you
'd
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
she
has
come
to
any
harm
,
"
cried
Chuffey
,
"
mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
old
and
silly
;
but
I
have
my
memory
sometimes
;
and
if
she
has
come
to
any
harm
---
"
   
"
Devil
take
you
,
"
interrupted
Jonas
,
but
in
a
suppressed
voice
still
;
"
what
harm
do
you
suppose
she
has
come
to
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
where
she
is
than
you
do
;
I
wish
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
till
she
comes
home
,
and
see
;
she
ca
n't
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
Will
that
content
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mind
!
"
exclaimed
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
hair
of
her
head
!
<EOS>
not
a
hair
of
her
head
ill
-
used
!
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
---
have
borne
it
too
long
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
silent
,
but
I
---
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
can
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
can
speak
---
"
he
stammered
,
as
he
crept
back
to
his
chair
,
and
turned
a
threatening
,
though
a
feeble
,
look
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
speak
,
can
you
!
"
thought
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
so
,
we
'll
stop
your
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
well
<EOS>
I
knew
of
this
in
good
time
.
 
<EOS>
Prevention
is
better
than
cure
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
made
a
poor
show
of
playing
the
bully
and
evincing
a
desire
to
conciliate
at
the
same
time
,
but
was
so
afraid
of
the
old
man
that
great
drops
had
started
out
upon
his
brow
;
and
they
stood
there
yet
.
 
<EOS>
His
unusual
tone
of
voice
and
agitated
manner
had
sufficiently
expressed
his
fear
;
but
his
face
would
have
done
so
now
,
without
that
aid
,
as
he
again
walked
to
and
fro
,
glancing
at
him
by
the
candelight
.
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
at
the
window
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
An
opposite
shop
was
lighted
up
;
and
the
tradesman
and
a
customer
were
reading
some
printed
bill
together
across
the
counter
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
brought
him
back
,
instantly
,
to
the
occupation
he
had
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
here
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
of
this
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
found
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
suspect
ME
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
hand
upon
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
pleasant
evenin
'
,
"
said
the
voice
of
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
though
warm
,
which
,
bless
you
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
<EOS>
,
we
must
expect
when
cowcumbers
is
three
for
twopence
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
Mr
Chuffey
find
his
self
to
-
night
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
kept
particularly
close
to
the
door
in
saying
this
,
and
curtseyed
more
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
appear
to
be
quite
so
much
at
her
ease
as
she
generally
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
him
to
his
room
,
"
said
Jonas
,
walking
up
to
her
,
and
speaking
in
her
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
raving
to
-
night
---
stark
mad
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
talk
while
he
's
here
,
but
come
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
sweet
dear
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
with
uncommon
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
all
of
a
tremble
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
he
may
be
,
"
said
Jonas
,
"
after
the
mad
fit
he
has
had
.
 
<EOS>
Get
him
upstairs
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
by
this
time
assisting
him
to
rise
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
my
blessed
old
chick
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Gamp
,
in
a
tone
that
was
at
once
soothing
and
encouraging
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
my
darlin
'
Mr
Chuffey
!
<EOS>
Now
come
up
to
your
own
room
,
sir
,
and
lay
down
on
your
bed
a
bit
;
for
you
're
a
-
shakin
'
all
over
,
as
if
your
precious
jints
was
hung
upon
wires
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
good
creetur
!
 
<EOS>
Come
with
Sairey
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
she
come
home
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
'll
be
here
directly
minit
,
"
returned
Mrs
Gamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
Sairey
,
Mr
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
Come
with
your
own
Sairey
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
good
woman
had
no
reference
to
any
female
in
the
world
in
promising
this
speedy
advent
of
the
person
for
whom
Mr
Chuffey
inquired
,
but
merely
threw
it
out
as
a
means
of
pacifying
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
its
effect
,
for
he
permitted
her
to
lead
him
away
;
and
they
quitted
the
room
together
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
looked
out
of
the
window
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
still
reading
the
printed
paper
in
the
shop
opposite
,
and
a
third
man
had
joined
in
the
perusal
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
it
be
,
to
interest
them
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
dispute
or
discussion
seemed
to
arise
among
them
,
for
they
all
looked
up
from
their
reading
together
,
and
one
of
the
three
,
who
had
been
glancing
over
the
shoulder
of
another
,
stepped
back
to
explain
or
illustrate
some
action
by
his
gestures
.
   
<EOS>
Horror
!
 
<EOS>
How
like
the
blow
he
had
struck
in
the
wood
!
   
<EOS>
It
beat
him
from
the
window
as
if
it
had
lighted
on
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
staggered
into
a
chair
,
he
thought
of
the
change
in
Mrs
Gamp
exhibited
in
her
new
-
born
tenderness
to
her
charge
.
 
<EOS>
Was
that
because
it
was
found
?
---
because
she
knew
of
it
?
---
because
she
suspected
him
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Chuffey
is
a
-
lyin
'
down
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
returning
,
"
and
much
good
<EOS>
may
it
do
him
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
which
harm
it
ca
n't
and
good
<EOS>
it
may
;
be
joyful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
"
said
Jonas
,
hoarsely
,
"
and
let
us
get
this
business
done
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
the
other
woman
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
other
person
's
with
him
now
,
"
she
answered
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
fit
to
be
left
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Why
,
he
fastened
on
me
to
-
night
;
here
,
upon
my
coat
;
like
a
savage
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Old
as
he
is
,
and
feeble
as
he
is
usually
,
I
had
some
trouble
to
shake
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
You
---
Hush
!
---
<EOS>
It
's
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
You
told
me
the
other
woman
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mentioned
Betsey
Prig
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
to
be
trusted
,
is
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
she
ai
n't
!
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
;
"
nor
have
I
brought
her
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
<EOS>
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
brought
another
,
which
engages
to
give
every
satigefaction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
her
name
?
"
asked
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
looked
at
him
in
an
odd
way
without
returning
any
answer
,
but
appeared
to
understand
the
question
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
her
name
?
"
repeated
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
name
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
is
Harris
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
extraordinary
how
much
effort
it
cost
Mrs
Gamp
to
pronounce
the
name
she
was
commonly
so
ready
with
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
some
three
or
four
gasps
before
she
could
get
it
out
;
and
,
when
she
had
uttered
it
,
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
side
,
and
turned
up
her
eyes
,
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
knowing
her
to
labour
under
a
complication
of
internal
disorders
,
which
rendered
a
few
drops
of
spirits
indispensable
at
certain
times
to
her
existence
,
and
which
came
on
very
strong
when
that
remedy
was
not
at
hand
,
Jonas
merely
supposed
her
to
be
the
victim
of
one
of
these
attacks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
hastily
,
for
he
felt
how
incapable
he
was
of
confining
his
wandering
attention
to
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
and
she
have
arranged
to
take
care
of
him
,
have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
softly
discharged
herself
of
her
familiar
phrase
,
"
Turn
and
turn
about
;
one
off
,
one
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
she
spoke
so
tremulously
that
she
felt
called
upon
to
add
,
"
which
fiddle
-
strings
is
weakness
to
expredge
my
nerves
this
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
stopped
to
listen
.
 
<EOS>
Then
said
,
hurriedly
:
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
quarrel
about
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
be
the
same
as
they
were
before
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
him
close
,
and
keep
him
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
be
restrained
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
got
it
in
his
head
to
-
night
that
my
wife
's
dead
,
and
has
been
attacking
me
as
if
I
had
killed
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
---
<EOS>
it
's
common
with
mad
people
to
take
the
worst
fancies
of
those
they
like
best
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
assented
with
a
short
groan
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
him
close
,
then
,
or
in
one
of
his
fits
he
'll
be
doing
me
a
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
trust
him
at
any
time
;
for
when
he
seems
most
rational
,
he
's
wildest
in
his
talk
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
you
know
already
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
the
other
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
t'other
person
,
sir
?
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
 
<EOS>
Go
you
to
him
and
send
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
busy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
took
two
or
three
backward
steps
towards
the
door
,
and
stopped
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
wishes
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
sort
of
quavering
croak
,
"
to
see
the
t'other
person
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
the
ghastly
change
in
Jonas
told
her
that
the
other
person
was
already
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Before
she
could
look
round
towards
the
door
,
she
was
put
aside
by
old
Martin
's
hand
;
and
Chuffey
and
John
Westlock
entered
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
no
one
leave
the
house
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
man
is
my
brother
's
son
.
 
<EOS>
Ill
-
met
,
ill
-
trained
,
ill
-
begotten
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
moves
from
the
spot
on
which
he
stands
,
or
speaks
a
word
above
his
breath
to
any
person
here
,
open
the
window
,
and
call
for
help
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
right
have
you
to
give
such
directions
in
this
house
?
"
asked
Jonas
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
right
of
your
wrong
-
doing
.
 
<EOS>
Come
in
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
An
irrepressible
exclamation
burst
from
the
lips
of
Jonas
,
as
Lewsome
entered
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
groan
,
or
a
shriek
,
or
a
word
,
but
was
wholly
unlike
any
sound
that
had
ever
fallen
on
the
ears
of
those
who
heard
it
,
while
at
the
same
time
it
was
the
most
sharp
and
terrible
expression
of
what
was
working
in
his
guilty
breast
,
that
nature
could
have
invented
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
done
murder
for
this
!
 
<EOS>
He
had
girdled
himself
about
with
perils
,
agonies
of
mind
,
innumerable
fears
,
for
this
!
 
<EOS>
He
had
hidden
his
secret
in
the
wood
;
pressed
and
stamped
it
down
into
the
bloody
ground
;
and
here
it
started
up
when
least
expected
,
miles
upon
miles
away
;
known
to
many
;
proclaiming
itself
from
the
lips
of
an
old
man
who
had
renewed
his
strength
and
vigour
as
by
a
miracle
,
to
give
it
voice
against
him
!
   
<EOS>
He
leaned
his
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
,
and
looked
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
to
try
to
do
so
scornfully
,
or
with
his
usual
insolence
.
<EOS>
He
required
the
chair
for
his
support
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
made
a
struggle
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
fellow
,
"
he
said
,
fetching
his
breath
at
every
word
,
and
pointing
his
trembling
finger
towards
Lewsome
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
the
greatest
liar
alive
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
his
last
tale
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
rare
fellows
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
that
uncle
of
mine
is
childish
;
he
's
even
a
greater
child
than
his
brother
,
my
father
,
was
,
in
his
old
age
;
or
than
Chuffey
is
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
devil
do
you
mean
,
"
he
added
,
looking
fiercely
at
John
Westlock
and
Mark
Tapley
(
the
latter
had
entered
with
Lewsome
)
,
"
by
coming
here
,
and
bringing
two
idiots
and
a
knave
with
you
to
take
my
house
by
storm
?
 
<EOS>
Hallo
,
there
!
 
<EOS>
Open
the
door
!
<EOS>
Turn
these
strangers
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
"
cried
Mr
Tapley
,
coming
forward
,
"
if
it
was
n't
for
your
name
,
I
'd
drag
you
through
the
streets
of
my
own
accord
,
and
single
-
handed
I
would
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
I
would
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
try
and
look
bold
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
do
it
!
 
<EOS>
Now
go
on
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
this
was
to
old
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
the
murderin
'
wagabond
upon
his
knees
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
wants
noise
,
he
shall
have
enough
of
it
;
for
as
sure
as
he
's
a
shiverin
'
from
head
to
foot
I
'll
raise
a
uproar
at
this
winder
that
shall
bring
half
London
in
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Let
him
try
me
once
,
and
see
whether
I
'm
a
man
of
my
word
or
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
,
Mark
folded
his
arms
,
and
took
his
seat
upon
the
window
-
ledge
,
with
an
air
of
general
preparation
for
anything
,
which
seemed
to
imply
that
he
was
equally
ready
to
jump
out
himself
,
or
to
throw
Jonas
out
,
upon
receiving
the
slightest
hint
that
it
would
be
agreeable
to
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
turned
to
Lewsome
:
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
man
,
"
he
said
,
extending
his
hand
towards
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
do
no
more
than
look
at
him
to
be
sure
of
that
,
or
of
the
truth
of
what
I
have
said
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
my
witness
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
brother
!
"
cried
old
Martin
,
clasping
his
hands
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
brother
,
brother
!
 
<EOS>
Were
we
strangers
half
our
lives
that
you
might
breed
a
wretch
like
this
,
and
I
make
life
a
desert
by
withering
every
flower
that
grew
about
me
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
the
natural
end
of
your
precepts
and
mine
,
that
this
should
be
the
creature
of
your
rearing
,
training
,
teaching
,
hoarding
,
striving
for
;
and
I
the
means
of
bringing
him
to
punishment
,
when
nothing
can
repair
the
wasted
past
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
sat
down
upon
a
chair
as
he
spoke
,
and
turning
away
his
face
,
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
.
 
<EOS>
Then
with
recovered
energy
he
proceeded
:
   
"
<EOS>
But
the
accursed
harvest
of
our
mistaken
lives
shall
be
trodden
down
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
too
late
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
confronted
with
this
man
,
you
monster
there
;
not
to
be
spared
,
but
to
be
dealt
with
justly
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
what
he
says
!
 
<EOS>
Reply
,
be
silent
,
contradict
,
repeat
,
defy
,
do
what
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
My
course
will
be
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
!
 
<EOS>
And
you
,
"
he
said
to
Chuffey
,
"
for
the
love
of
your
old
friend
,
speak
out
,
good
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
silent
for
his
love
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
urged
me
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
me
promise
it
upon
his
dying
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
would
have
spoken
,
but
for
your
finding
out
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
thought
about
it
ever
since
;
I
could
n't
help
that
;
and
sometimes
I
have
had
it
all
before
me
in
a
dream
;
but
in
the
day
-
time
,
not
in
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
such
a
kind
of
dream
?
"
said
Chuffey
,
looking
anxiously
in
old
Martin
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
As
Martin
made
him
an
encouraging
reply
,
he
listened
attentively
to
his
voice
,
and
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
aye
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
often
spoke
to
me
like
that
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
at
school
together
,
he
and
I.
 
I
could
n't
turn
against
his
son
,
you
know
---
his
only
son
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
to
Heaven
you
had
been
his
son
!
"
said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
speak
so
like
my
dear
old
master
,
"
cried
the
old
man
with
a
childish
delight
,
"
that
I
almost
think
I
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hear
you
quite
as
well
as
I
used
to
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
makes
me
young
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
spoke
unkindly
to
me
,
and
I
always
understood
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
always
see
him
too
,
though
my
sight
was
dim
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
dead
,
he
's
dead
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
good
to
me
,
my
dear
old
master
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
mournfully
over
the
brother
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Mark
,
who
had
been
glancing
out
of
the
window
,
left
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
turn
against
his
only
son
,
you
know
,
"
said
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
nearly
driven
me
to
do
it
sometimes
;
he
very
nearly
did
tonight
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
cried
the
old
man
,
with
a
sudden
recollection
of
the
cause
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
 
<EOS>
She
's
not
come
home
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
his
wife
?
"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
removed
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
in
my
care
,
and
will
be
spared
the
present
knowledge
of
what
is
passing
here
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
known
misery
enough
,
without
that
addition
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
heard
this
with
a
sinking
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
they
were
on
his
heels
,
and
felt
that
they
were
resolute
to
run
him
to
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
Inch
by
inch
the
ground
beneath
him
was
sliding
from
his
feet
;
faster
and
faster
the
encircling
ruin
contracted
and
contracted
towards
himself
,
its
wicked
centre
,
until
it
should
close
in
and
crush
him
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
accomplice
stating
to
his
face
,
with
every
circumstance
of
time
and
place
and
incident
;
and
openly
proclaiming
,
with
no
reserve
,
suppression
,
passion
,
or
concealment
;
all
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
,
which
nothing
would
keep
down
;
which
blood
would
not
smother
,
and
earth
would
not
hide
;
the
truth
,
whose
terrible
inspiration
seemed
to
change
dotards
into
strong
men
;
and
on
whose
avenging
wings
,
one
whom
he
had
supposed
to
be
at
the
extremest
corner
of
the
earth
came
swooping
down
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
tried
to
deny
it
,
but
his
tongue
would
not
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
conceived
some
desperate
thought
of
rushing
away
,
and
tearing
through
the
streets
;
but
his
limbs
would
as
little
answer
to
his
will
as
his
stark
,
stiff
staring
face
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
voice
went
slowly
on
,
denouncing
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
every
drop
of
blood
in
the
wood
had
found
a
voice
to
jeer
him
with
.
   
<EOS>
When
it
ceased
,
another
voice
took
up
the
tale
,
but
strangely
;
for
the
old
clerk
,
who
had
watched
,
and
listened
to
the
whole
,
and
had
wrung
his
hands
from
time
to
time
,
as
if
he
knew
its
truth
and
could
confirm
it
,
broke
in
with
these
words
:
   
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
you
're
wrong
;
you
're
wrong
---
all
wrong
together
!
 
<EOS>
Have
patience
,
for
the
truth
is
only
known
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
that
be
,
"
said
his
old
master
's
brother
,
"
after
what
you
have
heard
?
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
said
just
now
,
above
-
stairs
,
when
I
told
you
of
the
accusation
against
him
,
that
you
knew
he
was
his
father
's
murderer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
yes
!
<EOS>
and
so
he
was
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Chuffey
,
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
not
as
you
suppose
---
not
as
you
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
!
 
<EOS>
Give
me
a
moment
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
it
all
here
---
all
here
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
foul
,
foul
,
cruel
,
bad
;
but
not
as
you
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
stay
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hands
up
to
his
head
,
as
if
it
throbbed
or
pained
him
.
<EOS>
After
looking
about
him
in
a
wandering
and
vacant
manner
for
some
moments
,
his
eyes
rested
upon
Jonas
,
when
they
kindled
up
with
sudden
recollection
and
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
cried
old
Chuffey
,
"
yes
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
how
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
upon
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
---
he
got
up
from
his
bed
before
he
died
,
to
be
sure
,
to
say
that
he
forgave
him
;
and
he
came
down
with
me
into
this
room
;
and
when
he
saw
him
---
his
only
son
,
the
son
he
loved
---
his
speech
forsook
him
;
he
had
no
speech
for
what
he
knew
---
and
no
one
understood
him
except
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
did
---
I
did
!
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
regarded
him
in
amazement
;
so
did
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
,
who
had
said
nothing
yet
;
but
had
kept
two
-
thirds
of
herself
behind
the
door
,
ready
for
escape
,
and
one
-
third
in
the
room
,
ready
for
siding
with
the
strongest
party
;
came
a
little
further
in
and
remarked
,
with
a
sob
,
that
Mr
Chuffey
was
"
the
sweetest
old
creetur
goin'
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
bought
the
stuff
,
"
said
Chuffey
,
stretching
out
his
arm
towards
Jonas
while
an
unwonted
fire
shone
in
his
eye
,
and
lightened
up
his
face
;
"
he
bought
the
stuff
,
no
doubt
,
as
you
have
heard
,
and
brought
it
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
mixed
the
stuff
---
look
at
him
!
<EOS>
---
with
some
sweetmeat
in
a
jar
,
exactly
as
the
medicine
for
his
father
's
cough
was
mixed
,
and
put
it
in
a
drawer
;
in
that
drawer
yonder
in
the
desk
;
he
knows
which
drawer
<EOS>
I
mean
!
 
<EOS>
He
kept
it
there
locked
up
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
courage
failed
him
or
his
heart
was
touched
---
my
God
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
was
his
heart
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
his
only
son
!
<EOS>
---
and
he
did
not
put
it
in
the
usual
place
,
where
my
old
master
would
have
taken
it
twenty
times
a
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
trembling
figure
of
the
old
man
shook
with
the
strong
emotions
that
possessed
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
with
the
same
light
in
his
eye
,
and
with
his
arm
outstretched
,
and
with
his
grey
hair
stirring
on
his
head
,
he
seemed
to
grow
in
size
,
and
was
like
a
man
inspired
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
shrunk
from
looking
at
him
,
and
cowered
down
into
the
chair
by
which
he
had
held
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
this
tremendous
Truth
could
make
the
dumb
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
every
word
now
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Every
word
!
 
<EOS>
He
put
it
in
that
drawer
,
as
I
have
said
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
so
often
there
,
and
was
so
secret
,
that
his
father
took
notice
of
it
;
and
when
he
was
out
,
had
it
opened
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
there
together
,
and
we
found
the
mixture
---
Mr
Chuzzlewit
and
<EOS>
I.
 
He
took
it
into
his
possession
,
and
made
light
of
it
at
the
time
;
but
in
the
night
he
came
to
my
bedside
,
weeping
,
and
told
me
that
his
own
son
had
it
in
his
mind
to
poison
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Chuff
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
old
Chuff
!
<EOS>
a
voice
came
into
my
room
to
-
night
,
and
told
me
that
this
crime
began
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
began
when
I
taught
him
to
be
too
covetous
of
what
I
have
to
leave
,
and
made
the
expectation
of
it
his
great
business
!
"
 
<EOS>
Those
were
his
words
;
aye
,
they
are
his
very
words
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
was
a
hard
man
now
and
then
,
it
was
for
his
only
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
loved
his
only
son
,
and
he
was
always
good
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
listened
with
increased
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Hope
was
breaking
in
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
He
shall
not
weary
for
my
death
,
Chuff
;
"
that
was
what
he
said
next
,
"
pursued
the
old
clerk
,
as
he
wiped
his
eyes
;
"
that
was
what
he
said
next
,
crying
like
a
little
child
:
"
He
shall
not
weary
for
my
death
,
Chuff
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
have
it
now
;
he
shall
marry
where
he
has
a
fancy
,
Chuff
,
although
it
do
n't
please
me
;
and
you
and
I
will
go
away
and
live
upon
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
loved
him
;
perhaps
he
'll
love
me
then
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
my
own
child
thirsting
for
my
death
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
might
have
known
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sown
,
and
I
must
reap
.
<EOS>
He
shall
believe
that
I
am
taking
this
;
and
when
I
see
that
he
is
sorry
,
and
has
all
he
wants
,
I
'll
tell
him
that
I
found
it
out
,
and
I
'll
forgive
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
make
a
better
man
of
his
own
son
,
and
be
a
better
man
himself
,
perhaps
,
Chuff
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
Poor
Chuffey
paused
to
dry
his
eyes
again
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Martin
's
face
was
hidden
in
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
listened
still
more
keenly
,
and
his
breast
heaved
like
a
swollen
water
,
but
with
hope
.
 
<EOS>
With
growing
hope
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
old
master
made
believe
next
day
,
"
said
Chuffey
,
"
that
he
had
opened
the
drawer
by
mistake
with
a
key
from
the
bunch
,
which
happened
to
fit
it
<EOS>
(
we
had
one
made
and
hung
upon
it
)
;
and
that
he
had
been
surprised
to
find
his
fresh
supply
of
cough
medicine
in
such
a
place
,
but
supposed
it
had
been
put
there
in
a
hurry
when
the
drawer
stood
open
.
 
<EOS>
We
burnt
it
;
but
his
son
believed
that
he
was
taking
it
---
he
knows
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
Once
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
to
try
him
,
took
heart
to
say
it
had
a
strange
taste
;
and
he
got
up
directly
,
and
went
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
gave
a
short
,
dry
cough
;
and
,
changing
his
position
for
an
easier
one
,
folded
his
arms
without
looking
at
them
,
though
they
could
now
see
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Chuzzlewit
wrote
to
her
father
;
I
mean
the
father
of
the
poor
thing
who
's
his
wife
,
"
said
Chuffey
;
"
and
got
him
to
come
up
,
intending
to
hasten
on
the
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
mind
,
like
mine
,
went
a
little
wrong
through
grief
,
and
then
his
heart
broke
.
 
<EOS>
He
sank
and
altered
from
the
time
when
he
came
to
me
in
the
night
;
and
never
held
up
his
head
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
a
few
days
,
but
he
had
never
changed
so
much
in
twice
the
years
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spare
him
,
Chuff
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
before
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
the
only
words
he
could
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spare
him
,
Chuff
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
promised
him
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
tried
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
his
only
son
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
his
recollection
of
the
last
scene
in
his
old
friend
's
life
,
poor
Chuffey
's
voice
,
which
had
grown
weaker
and
weaker
,
quite
deserted
him
.
 
<EOS>
Making
a
motion
with
his
hand
,
as
if
he
would
have
said
that
Anthony
had
taken
it
,
and
had
died
with
it
in
his
,
he
retreated
to
the
corner
where
he
usually
concealed
his
sorrows
;
and
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
could
look
at
his
company
now
,
and
vauntingly
too
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
satisfied
?
<EOS>
or
have
you
any
more
of
your
plots
to
broach
?
 
<EOS>
Why
that
fellow
,
Lewsome
,
can
invent
'em
for
you
by
the
score
.
 
<EOS>
Is
this
all
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
nothing
else
?
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
looked
at
him
steadily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whether
you
are
what
you
seemed
to
be
at
Pecksniff
's
,
or
are
something
else
and
a
mountebank
,
I
do
n't
know
and
I
do
n't
care
,
"
said
Jonas
,
looking
downward
with
a
smile
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
want
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
here
so
often
when
your
brother
was
alive
,
and
were
always
so
fond
of
him
(
your
dear
,
dear
brother
,
and
you
would
have
been
cuffing
one
another
before
this
,
ecod
!
)
,
that
I
am
not
surprised
at
your
being
attached
to
the
place
;
but
the
place
is
not
attached
to
you
,
and
you
ca
n't
leave
it
too
soon
,
though
you
may
leave
it
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
And
for
my
wife
,
old
man
,
send
her
home
straight
,
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
You
carry
it
with
a
high
hand
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
n't
hanging
yet
for
a
man
to
keep
a
penn'orth
of
poison
for
his
own
purposes
,
and
have
it
taken
from
him
by
two
old
crazy
jolter
-
heads
who
go
and
act
a
play
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
the
door
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
base
triumph
,
struggling
with
his
cowardice
,
and
shame
,
and
guilt
,
was
so
detestable
,
that
they
turned
away
from
him
,
as
if
he
were
some
obscene
and
filthy
animal
,
repugnant
to
the
sight
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
that
last
black
crime
was
busy
with
him
too
;
working
within
him
to
his
perdition
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
that
,
the
old
clerk
's
story
might
have
touched
him
,
though
never
so
lightly
;
but
for
that
,
the
sudden
removal
of
so
great
a
load
might
have
brought
about
some
wholesome
change
even
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
With
that
deed
done
,
however
;
with
that
unnecessary
wasteful
danger
haunting
him
;
despair
was
in
his
very
triumph
and
relief
;
wild
,
ungovernable
,
raging
despair
,
for
the
uselessness
of
the
peril
into
which
he
had
plunged
;
despair
that
hardened
him
and
maddened
him
,
and
set
his
teeth
a
-
grinding
in
a
moment
of
his
exultation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
friend
!
<EOS>
"
said
old
Martin
,
laying
his
hand
on
Chuffey
's
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
no
place
for
you
to
remain
in
.
 
<EOS>
Come
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
his
old
way
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Chuffey
,
looking
up
into
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
almost
believe
it
's
Mr
Chuzzlewit
alive
again
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
Take
me
with
you
!
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
though
,
stay
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
what
?
"
asked
old
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
leave
her
,
poor
thing
!
"
said
Chuffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
very
good
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
leave
her
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit

<EOS>
Thank
you
kindly

<EOS>
I
'll
remain
here

<EOS>
I
have
n't
long
to
remain
;
it
's
no
great
matter

"
   
<EOS>
As
he
meekly
shook
his
poor
,
grey
head
,
and
thanked
old
Martin
in
these
words
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
now
entirely
in
the
room
,
was
affected
to
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
mercy
as
it
is

"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
as
sech
a

<EOS>
"
You
heard
me
speak
to
you
just
now

said
Jonas
to
his
uncle

"
I

<EOS>
"
Do
YOU
see
the
door

"
returned
the
voice
of
Mark
,
coming
from
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
,
and
his
gaze
was
nailed
there
.
 
<EOS>
Fatal
,
ill
-
omened
blighted
threshold
,
cursed
by
his
father
's
footsteps
in
his
dying
hour
,
cursed
by
his
young
wife
's
sorrowing
tread
,
cursed
by
the
daily
shadow
of
the
old
clerk
's
figure
,
cursed
by
the
crossing
of
his
murderer
's
feet
---
what
men
were
standing
in
the
door
way
!
   
<EOS>
Nadgett
foremost
.
   
<EOS>
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
It
came
on
,
roaring
like
a
sea
!
 
<EOS>
Hawkers
burst
into
the
street
,
crying
it
up
and
down
;
windows
were
thrown
open
that
the
inhabitants
might
hear
it
;
people
stopped
to
listen
in
the
road
and
on
the
pavement
;
the
bells
,
the
same
bells
,
began
to
ring
;
tumbling
over
one
another
in
a
dance
of
boisterous
joy
at
the
discovery
(
that
was
the
sound
they
had
in
his
distempered
thoughts
)
,
and
making
their
airy
play
-
ground
rock
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
man
,
"
said
Nadgett
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
window
!
"
   
Three
others
came
in
,
laid
hands
upon
him
,
and
secured
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
quickly
done
,
that
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
the
informer
's
face
for
an
instant
when
his
wrists
were
manacled
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Murder
,
"
said
Nadgett
,
looking
round
on
the
astonished
group
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
no
one
interfere
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
sounding
street
repeated
Murder
;
barbarous
and
dreadful
Murder
.
<EOS>
Murder
,
Murder
,
Murder
.
 
<EOS>
Rolling
on
from
house
to
house
,
and
echoing
from
stone
to
stone
,
until
the
voices
died
away
into
the
distant
hum
,
which
seemed
to
mutter
the
same
word
!
   
<EOS>
They
all
stood
silent
:
listening
,
and
gazing
in
each
other
's
faces
,
as
the
noise
passed
on
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
was
the
first
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
terrible
history
is
this
?
"
he
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
HIM
,
"
said
Nadgett
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
his
friend
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
tell
you
,
if
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
more
of
it
than
I
do
,
though
I
know
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
watching
him
so
long
for
nothing
,
"
returned
Nadgett
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
watched
a
man
so
close
as
I
have
watched
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Another
of
the
phantom
forms
of
this
terrific
Truth
!
 
<EOS>
Another
of
the
many
shapes
in
which
it
started
up
about
him
,
out
of
vacancy
.
 
<EOS>
This
man
,
of
all
men
in
the
world
,
a
spy
upon
him
;
this
man
,
changing
his
identity
;
casting
off
his
shrinking
,
purblind
,
unobservant
character
,
and
springing
up
into
a
watchful
enemy
!
 
<EOS>
The
dead
man
might
have
come
out
of
his
grave
,
and
not
confounded
and
appalled
him
more
.
   
<EOS>
The
game
was
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
race
was
at
an
end
;
the
rope
was
woven
for
his
neck
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
by
a
miracle
,
he
could
escape
from
this
strait
,
he
had
but
to
turn
his
face
another
way
,
no
matter
where
,
and
there
would
rise
some
new
avenger
front
to
front
with
him
;
some
infant
in
an
hour
grown
old
,
or
old
man
in
an
hour
grown
young
,
or
blind
man
with
his
sight
restored
,
or
deaf
man
with
his
hearing
given
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
chance
.
 
<EOS>
He
sank
down
in
a
heap
against
the
wall
,
and
never
hoped
again
from
that
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
his
friend
,
although
I
have
the
honour
to
be
his
relative
,
"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Where
have
you
watched
,
and
what
have
you
seen
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
watched
in
many
places
,
"
returned
Nadgett
,
"
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
watched
him
lately
,
almost
without
rest
or
relief
;
"
his
anxious
face
and
bloodshot
eyes
confirmed
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
little
thought
to
what
my
watching
was
to
lead
.
 
<EOS>
As
little
as
he
did
when
he
slipped
out
in
the
night
,
dressed
in
those
clothes
which
he
afterwards
sunk
in
a
bundle
at
London
Bridge
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
moved
upon
the
ground
like
a
man
in
bodily
torture
.
 
<EOS>
He
uttered
a
suppressed
groan
,
as
if
he
had
been
wounded
by
some
cruel
weapon
;
and
plucked
at
the
iron
band
upon
his
wrists
,
as
though
(
his
hands
being
free
)
<EOS>
he
would
have
torn
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Steady
,
kinsman
!
"
said
the
chief
officer
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
violent
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whom
do
you
call
kinsman
?
<EOS>
"
asked
old
Martin
sternly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
among
others
.
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
turned
his
scrutinizing
gaze
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
lazily
across
a
chair
with
his
arms
resting
on
the
back
;
eating
nuts
,
and
throwing
the
shells
out
of
window
as
he
cracked
them
,
which
he
still
continued
to
do
while
speaking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
sulky
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
deny
your
nephews
till
you
die
;
but
Chevy
Slyme
is
Chevy
Slyme
still
,
all
the
world
over
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
even
you
may
feel
it
some
disgrace
to
your
own
blood
to
be
employed
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
to
be
bought
off
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
every
turn
!
"
cried
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Self
,
self
,
self
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
among
them
for
himself
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
save
one
or
two
among
them
the
trouble
then
and
be
for
them
as
well
as
YOURself
,
"
replied
his
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
here
at
me
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
see
the
man
of
your
family
who
has
more
talent
in
his
little
finger
than
all
the
rest
in
their
united
brains
,
dressed
as
a
police
officer
without
being
ashamed
?
 
<EOS>
I
took
up
with
this
trade
on
purpose
to
shame
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
think
I
should
have
to
make
a
capture
in
the
family
,
though
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
your
debauchery
,
and
that
of
your
chosen
friends
,
has
really
brought
you
to
this
level
,
"
returned
the
old
man
,
"
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
living
honestly
,
I
hope
,
and
that
's
something
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
hard
upon
my
chosen
friends
,
"
returned
Slyme
,
"
<EOS>
for
they
were
sometimes
your
chosen
friends
too
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
you
never
employed
my
friend
Tigg
,
<EOS>
for
I
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
We
quarrelled
upon
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hired
the
fellow
,
"
retorted
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
and
I
paid
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
<EOS>
well
you
paid
him
,
"
said
his
nephew
,
"
<EOS>
for
it
would
be
too
late
to
do
so
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
given
his
receipt
in
full
;
or
had
it
forced
from
him
rather
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
curious
to
know
what
he
meant
,
but
scorned
to
prolong
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
expected
that
he
and
I
would
be
brought
together
again
in
the
course
of
business
,
"
said
Slyme
,
taking
a
fresh
handful
of
nuts
from
his
pocket
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
thought
he
would
be
wanted
for
some
swindling
job
;
it
never
entered
my
head
that
I
should
hold
a
warrant
for
the
apprehension
of
his
murderer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
HIS
murderer
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
looking
from
one
to
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
or
Mr
Montague
's
,
"
said
Nadgett
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
the
same
,
I
am
told
.
 
<EOS>
I
accuse
him
yonder
of
the
murder
of
Mr
Montague
,
who
was
found
last
night
,
killed
,
in
a
wood
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
ask
me
why
I
accuse
him
as
you
have
already
asked
me
how
I
know
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
.
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
remain
a
secret
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
ruling
passion
of
the
man
expressed
itself
even
then
,
in
the
tone
of
regret
in
which
he
deplored
the
approaching
publicity
of
what
he
knew
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
had
watched
him
,
"
he
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
instructed
to
do
so
by
Mr
Montague
,
in
whose
employment
I
have
been
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
We
had
our
suspicions
of
him
;
and
you
know
what
they
pointed
at
,
for
you
have
been
discussing
it
since
we
have
been
waiting
here
,
outside
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
care
to
hear
,
now
it
's
all
over
,
in
what
our
suspicions
began
,
I
'll
tell
you
plainly
:
in
a
quarrel
(
it
first
came
to
our
ears
through
a
hint
of
his
own
)
between
him
and
another
office
in
which
his
father
's
life
was
insured
,
and
which
had
so
much
doubt
and
distrust
upon
the
subject
,
that
he
compounded
with
them
,
and
took
half
the
money
;
and
was
glad
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Bit
by
bit
,
I
ferreted
out
more
circumstances
against
him
,
and
not
a
few
.
 
<EOS>
It
required
a
little
patience
,
but
it
's
my
calling
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
the
nurse
 
<EOS>
---
here
she
is
to
confirm
me
;
I
found
the
doctor
,
I
found
the
undertaker
,
I
found
the
undertaker
's
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
out
how
the
old
gentleman
there
,
Mr
Chuffey
,
had
behaved
at
the
funeral
;
and
I
found
out
what
this
man
,
"
touching
Lewsome
on
the
arm
,
"
had
talked
about
in
his
fever
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
out
how
he
conducted
himself
before
his
father
's
death
,
and
how
since
and
how
at
the
time
;
and
writing
it
all
down
,
and
putting
it
carefully
together
,
made
case
enough
for
Mr
Montague
to
tax
him
with
the
crime
,
which
(
as
he
himself
believed
until
to
-
night
)
he
had
committed
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
by
when
this
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
him
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
only
worse
than
he
was
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
miserable
,
miserable
fool
!
<EOS>
oh
,
insupportable
,
excruciating
torture
!
 
<EOS>
To
find
alive
and
active
---
a
party
to
it
all
---
the
brain
and
right
-
hand
of
the
secret
he
had
thought
to
crush
!
 
<EOS>
In
whom
,
though
he
had
walled
the
murdered
man
up
,
by
enchantment
in
a
rock
,
the
story
would
have
lived
and
walked
abroad
!
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
stop
his
ears
with
his
fettered
arms
,
that
he
might
shut
out
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
crouched
upon
the
floor
,
they
drew
away
from
him
as
if
a
pestilence
were
in
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
They
fell
off
,
one
by
one
,
from
that
part
of
the
room
,
leaving
him
alone
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Even
those
who
had
him
in
their
keeping
shunned
him
,
and
(
with
the
exception
of
Slyme
,
who
was
still
occupied
with
his
nuts
)
kept
apart
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
that
garret
-
window
opposite
,
"
said
Nadgett
,
pointing
across
the
narrow
street
,
"
I
have
watched
this
house
and
him
for
days
and
nights
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
garret
-
window
opposite
I
saw
him
return
home
,
alone
,
from
a
journey
on
which
he
had
set
out
with
Mr
Montague
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
token
that
Mr
Montague
's
end
was
gained
;
and
I
might
rest
easy
on
my
watch
,
though
I
was
not
to
leave
it
until
he
dismissed
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
standing
at
the
door
opposite
,
after
dark
that
same
night
,
I
saw
a
countryman
steal
out
of
this
house
,
by
a
side
-
door
in
the
court
,
who
had
never
entered
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
his
walk
,
and
that
it
was
himself
,
disguised
.
 
<EOS>
I
followed
him
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
I
lost
him
on
the
western
road
,
still
travelling
westward
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
looked
up
at
him
for
an
instant
,
and
muttered
an
oath
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
comprehend
what
this
meant
,
"
said
Nadgett
;
"
but
,
having
seen
so
much
,
I
resolved
to
see
it
out
,
and
through
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
did
.
<EOS>
Learning
,
on
inquiry
at
his
house
from
his
wife
,
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
sleeping
in
the
room
from
which
I
had
seen
him
go
out
,
and
that
he
had
given
strict
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
,
I
knew
that
he
was
coming
back
;
and
for
his
coming
back
I
watched
.
 
<EOS>
I
kept
my
watch
in
the
street
---
in
doorways
,
and
such
places
---
all
that
night
;
at
the
same
window
,
all
next
day
;
and
when
night
came
on
again
,
in
the
street
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
knew
he
would
come
back
,
as
he
had
gone
out
,
when
this
part
of
the
town
was
empty
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
,
the
same
countryman
came
creeping
,
creeping
,
creeping
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Look
sharp
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Slyme
,
who
had
now
finished
his
nuts
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
quite
irregular
,
Mr
Nadgett
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
kept
at
the
window
all
day
,
"
said
Nadgett
,
without
heeding
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
never
closed
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
,
I
saw
him
come
out
with
a
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
I
followed
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
down
the
steps
at
London
Bridge
,
and
sunk
it
in
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
began
to
entertain
some
serious
fears
,
and
made
a
communication
to
the
Police
,
which
caused
that
bundle
to
be
---
"
   
"
To
be
fished
up
,
"
interrupted
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
alive
,
Mr
Nadgett
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
contained
the
dress
I
had
seen
him
wear
,
"
said
Nadgett
;
"
stained
with
clay
,
and
spotted
with
blood
.
 
<EOS>
Information
of
the
murder
was
received
in
town
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
wearer
of
that
dress
is
already
known
to
have
been
seen
near
the
place
;
to
have
been
lurking
in
that
neighbourhood
;
and
to
have
alighted
from
a
coach
coming
from
that
part
of
the
country
,
at
a
time
exactly
tallying
with
the
very
minute
when
I
saw
him
returning
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
warrant
has
been
out
,
and
these
officers
have
been
with
me
,
some
hours
.
 
<EOS>
We
chose
our
time
;
and
seeing
you
come
in
,
and
seeing
this
person
at
the
window
---
"
   
"
Beckoned
to
him
,
"
said
Mark
,
taking
up
the
thread
of
the
narrative
,
on
hearing
this
allusion
to
himself
,
"
to
open
the
door
;
which
he
did
with
a
deal
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
at
present
,
"
said
Nadgett
,
putting
up
his
great
pocketbook
,
which
from
mere
habit
he
had
produced
when
he
began
his
revelation
,
and
had
kept
in
his
hand
all
the
time
;
"
but
there
is
plenty
more
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
You
asked
me
for
the
facts
,
so
far
I
have
related
them
,
and
need
not
detain
these
gentlemen
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
,
Mr
Slyme
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
something
more
,
"
replied
that
worthy
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
walk
round
to
the
office
,
we
shall
be
there
as
soon
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
Get
a
coach
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
officer
to
whom
he
spoke
departed
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Martin
lingered
for
a
few
moments
,
as
if
he
would
have
addressed
some
words
to
Jonas
;
but
looking
round
,
and
seeing
him
still
seated
on
the
floor
,
rocking
himself
in
a
savage
manner
to
and
fro
,
took
Chuffey
's
arm
,
and
slowly
followed
Nadgett
out
.
 
<EOS>
John
Westlock
and
Mark
Tapley
accompanied
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
had
tottered
out
first
,
for
the
better
display
of
her
feelings
,
in
a
kind
of
walking
swoon
;
for
Mrs
Gamp
performed
swoons
of
different
sorts
,
upon
a
moderate
notice
,
as
Mr
Mould
did
Funerals
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
muttered
Slyme
,
looking
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
As
insensible
of
being
disgraced
by
having
such
a
nephew
as
myself
,
in
such
a
situation
,
as
he
was
of
my
being
an
honour
and
a
credit
to
the
family
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
return
I
get
for
having
humbled
my
spirit
---
 
<EOS>
such
a
spirit
as
mine
---
to
earn
a
livelihood
,
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
got
up
from
his
chair
,
and
kicked
it
away
indignantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
such
a
livelihood
too
!
 
<EOS>
When
there
are
hundreds
of
men
,
not
fit
to
hold
a
candle
to
me
,
rolling
in
carriages
and
living
on
their
fortunes
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
it
's
a
nice
world
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
eyes
encountered
Jonas
,
who
looked
earnestly
towards
him
,
and
moved
his
lips
as
if
he
were
whispering
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
said
Slyme
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
glanced
at
the
attendant
whose
back
was
towards
him
,
and
made
a
clumsy
motion
with
his
bound
hands
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
"
said
Slyme
,
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
hope
to
disgrace
him
into
anything
when
you
have
shot
so
far
ahead
of
me
though
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
repeated
the
same
look
and
gesture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jack
!
"
said
Slyme
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
returned
his
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
down
to
the
door
,
ready
for
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Call
out
when
it
comes
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
have
you
there
.
 
<EOS>
Now
then
,
"
he
added
,
turning
hastily
to
Jonas
,
when
the
man
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
Jonas
essayed
to
rise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
bit
,
"
said
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
so
easy
when
your
wrists
are
tight
together
.
 
<EOS>
Now
then
!
 
<EOS>
Up
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Put
your
hand
in
my
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Here
!
 
<EOS>
The
breast
pocket
,
on
the
left
!
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
He
did
so
;
and
drew
out
a
purse
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
hundred
pound
in
it
,
"
said
Jonas
,
whose
words
were
almost
unintelligible
;
as
his
face
,
in
its
pallor
and
agony
,
was
scarcely
human
.
   
<EOS>
Slyme
looked
at
him
;
gave
it
into
his
hands
;
and
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
if
I
dared
.
 
<EOS>
Those
fellows
below
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Escape
's
impossible
,
"
said
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
One
hundred
pound
for
only
five
minutes
in
the
next
room
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
to
do
?
"
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
The
face
of
his
prisoner
as
he
advanced
to
whisper
in
his
ear
,
made
him
recoil
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
stopped
and
listened
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
words
were
few
,
but
his
own
face
changed
as
he
heard
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
about
me
,
"
said
Jonas
,
putting
his
hands
to
his
throat
,
as
though
whatever
he
referred
to
were
hidden
in
his
neckerchief
.
<EOS>
"
How
should
you
know
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
How
could
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
pound
for
only
five
minutes
in
the
next
room
!
 
<EOS>
The
time
's
passing
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
more
---
more
creditable
to
the
family
,
"
observed
Slyme
,
with
trembling
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
n't
told
me
half
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
Less
would
have
served
your
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
have
kept
it
to
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
pound
for
only
five
minutes
in
the
next
room
!
 
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonas
,
desperately
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
the
purse
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
,
with
a
wild
unsteady
step
,
retreated
to
the
door
in
the
glass
partition
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Slyme
,
catching
at
his
skirts
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
this
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
must
end
so
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
guilty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
the
proofs
as
they
were
told
just
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
said
Jonas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
---
will
you
engage
to
say
a
---
a
Prayer
,
now
,
or
something
of
that
sort
?
"
<EOS>
faltered
Slyme
.
   
<EOS>
Jonas
broke
from
him
without
replying
,
and
closed
the
door
between
them
.
   
<EOS>
Slyme
listened
at
the
keyhole
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
crept
away
on
tiptoe
,
as
far
off
as
he
could
;
and
looked
awfully
towards
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
roused
by
the
arrival
of
the
coach
,
and
their
letting
down
the
steps
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
getting
a
few
things
together
,
"
he
said
,
leaning
out
of
window
,
and
speaking
to
the
two
men
below
,
who
stood
in
the
full
light
of
a
street
-
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
eye
upon
the
back
,
one
of
you
,
for
form
's
sake
.
"
   
<EOS>
One
of
the
men
withdrew
into
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
,
seating
himself
self
on
the
steps
of
the
coach
,
remained
in
conversation
with
Slyme
at
the
window
who
perhaps
had
risen
to
be
his
superior
,
in
virtue
of
his
old
propensity
(
one
so
much
lauded
by
the
murdered
man
)
of
being
always
round
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
A
useful
habit
in
his
present
calling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
asked
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
Slyme
looked
into
the
room
for
an
instant
and
gave
his
head
a
jerk
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
booked
,
"
observed
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Through
,
"
said
Slyme
.
   
<EOS>
They
looked
at
each
other
,
and
up
and
down
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
on
the
coach
-
steps
took
his
hat
off
,
and
put
it
on
again
,
and
whistled
a
little
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
taking
his
time
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
remonstrated
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
allowed
him
five
minutes
,
"
said
Slyme
.
 
<EOS>
"
Time
's
more
than
up
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
bring
him
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
withdrew
from
the
window
accordingly
,
and
walked
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
in
the
partition
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
sound
within
.
<EOS>
He
set
the
candles
near
it
,
that
they
might
shine
through
the
glass
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
easy
,
he
found
,
to
make
up
his
mind
to
the
opening
of
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
flung
it
wide
open
suddenly
,
and
with
a
noise
;
then
retreated
.
 
<EOS>
After
peeping
in
and
listening
again
,
he
entered
.
   
<EOS>
He
started
back
as
his
eyes
met
those
of
Jonas
,
standing
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
,
and
staring
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
neckerchief
was
off
;
his
face
was
ashy
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
too
soon
,
"
said
Jonas
,
with
an
abject
whimper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
not
had
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
able
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
five
minutes
more
---
two
minutes
more
!
---
only
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
Slyme
gave
him
no
reply
,
but
thrusting
the
purse
upon
him
and
forcing
it
back
into
his
pocket
,
called
up
his
men
.
   
<EOS>
He
whined
,
and
cried
,
and
cursed
,
and
entreated
them
,
and
struggled
,
and
submitted
,
in
the
same
breath
,
and
had
no
power
to
stand
.
 
<EOS>
They
got
him
away
and
into
the
coach
,
where
they
put
him
on
a
seat
;
but
he
soon
fell
moaning
down
among
the
straw
at
the
bottom
,
and
lay
there
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
men
were
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Slyme
being
on
the
box
with
the
driver
;
and
they
let
him
lie
.
 
<EOS>
Happening
to
pass
a
fruiterer
's
on
their
way
;
the
door
of
which
was
open
,
though
the
shop
was
by
this
time
shut
;
one
of
them
remarked
how
faint
the
peaches
smelled
.
   
<EOS>
The
other
assented
at
the
moment
,
but
presently
stooped
down
in
quick
alarm
,
and
looked
at
the
prisoner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
the
coach
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
poisoned
himself
!
 
<EOS>
The
smell
comes
from
this
bottle
in
his
hand
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
hand
had
shut
upon
it
tight
.
 
<EOS>
With
that
rigidity
of
grasp
with
which
no
living
man
,
in
the
full
strength
and
energy
of
life
,
can
clutch
a
prize
he
has
won
.
   
<EOS>
They
dragged
him
out
into
the
dark
street
;
but
jury
,
judge
,
and
hangman
,
could
have
done
no
more
,
and
could
do
nothing
now
.
 
<EOS>
Dead

dead

dead

Chapter
52
.
<EOS>
In
which
the
tables
are
turned
,
completely
upside
down
 
Old
Martin
's
cherished
projects
,
so
long
hidden
in
his
own
breast
,
so
frequently
in
danger
of
abrupt
disclosure
through
the
bursting
forth
of
the
indignation
he
had
hoarded
up
during
his
residence
with
Mr
Pecksniff
,
were
retarded
,
but
not
beyond
a
few
hours
,
by
the
occurrences
just
now
related
.
 
<EOS>
Stunned
,
as
he
had
been
at
first
by
the
intelligence
conveyed
to
him
through
Tom
Pinch
and
John
Westlock
,
of
the
supposed
manner
of
his
brother
's
death
;
overwhelmed
as
he
was
by
the
subsequent
narratives
of
Chuffey
and
Nadgett
,
and
the
forging
of
that
chain
of
circumstances
ending
in
the
death
of
Jonas
,
of
which
catastrophe
he
was
immediately
informed
;
scattered
as
his
purposes
and
hopes
were
for
the
moment
,
by
the
crowding
in
of
all
these
incidents
between
him
and
his
end
;
still
their
very
intensity
and
the
tumult
of
their
assemblage
nerved
him
to
the
rapid
and
unyielding
execution
of
his
scheme
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
single
circumstance
,
whether
it
were
cruel
,
cowardly
,
or
false
,
he
saw
the
flowering
of
the
same
pregnant
seed
.
 
<EOS>
Self
;
grasping
,
eager
,
narrow
-
ranging
,
overreaching
self
;
with
its
long
train
of
suspicions
,
lusts
,
deceits
,
and
all
their
growing
consequences
;
was
the
root
of
the
vile
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
so
presented
his
character
before
the
old
man
's
eyes
,
that
he
---
the
good
,
the
tolerant
,
enduring
Pecksniff
---
had
become
the
incarnation
of
all
selfishness
and
treachery
;
and
the
more
odious
the
shapes
in
which
those
vices
ranged
themselves
before
him
now
,
the
sterner
consolation
he
had
in
his
design
of
setting
Mr
Pecksniff
right
and
Mr
Pecksniff
's
victims
too
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
work
he
brought
,
not
only
the
energy
and
determination
natural
to
his
character
(
which
,
as
the
reader
may
have
observed
in
the
beginning
of
his
or
her
acquaintance
with
this
gentleman
,
was
remarkable
for
the
strong
development
of
those
qualities
)
,
but
all
the
forced
and
unnaturally
nurtured
energy
consequent
upon
their
long
suppression
.
 
<EOS>
And
these
two
tides
of
resolution
setting
into
one
and
sweeping
on
,
became
so
strong
and
vigorous
,
that
,
to
prevent
themselves
from
being
carried
away
before
it
<EOS>
,
Heaven
knows
where
,
was
as
much
as
John
Westlock
and
Mark
Tapley
together
(
though
they
were
tolerably
energetic
too
)
could
manage
to
effect
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
sent
for
John
Westlock
immediately
on
his
arrival
;
and
John
,
under
the
conduct
of
Tom
Pinch
,
had
waited
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
Having
a
lively
recollection
of
Mr
Tapley
,
he
had
caused
that
gentleman
's
attendance
to
be
secured
,
through
John
's
means
,
without
delay
;
and
thus
,
as
we
have
seen
,
they
had
all
repaired
together
to
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
grandson
he
had
refused
to
see
until
to
-
morrow
,
when
Mr
Tapley
was
instructed
to
summon
him
to
the
Temple
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
he
would
not
allow
to
be
employed
in
anything
,
lest
he
should
be
wrongfully
suspected
;
but
he
was
a
party
to
all
their
proceedings
,
and
was
with
them
until
late
at
night
---
until
after
they
knew
of
the
death
of
Jonas
;
when
he
went
home
to
tell
all
these
wonders
to
little
Ruth
,
and
to
prepare
her
for
accompanying
him
to
the
Temple
in
the
morning
,
agreeably
to
Mr
Chuzzlewit
's
particular
injunction
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
characteristic
of
old
Martin
,
and
his
looking
on
to
something
which
he
had
distinctly
before
him
,
that
he
communicated
to
them
nothing
of
his
intentions
,
beyond
such
hints
of
reprisal
on
Mr
Pecksniff
as
they
gathered
from
the
game
he
had
played
in
that
gentleman
's
house
,
and
the
brightening
of
his
eyes
whenever
his
name
was
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
Even
to
John
Westlock
,
in
whom
he
was
evidently
disposed
to
place
great
confidence
(
which
may
indeed
be
said
of
every
one
of
them
)
,
he
gave
no
explanation
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
He
merely
requested
him
to
return
in
the
morning
;
and
with
this
for
their
utmost
satisfaction
,
they
left
him
,
when
the
night
was
far
advanced
,
alone
.
   
<EOS>
The
events
of
such
a
day
might
have
worn
out
the
body
and
spirit
of
a
much
younger
man
than
he
,
but
he
sat
in
deep
and
painful
meditation
until
the
morning
was
bright
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
even
then
seek
any
prolonged
repose
,
but
merely
slumbered
in
his
chair
,
until
seven
o'clock
,
when
Mr
Tapley
had
appointed
to
come
to
him
by
his
desire
;
and
came
---
as
fresh
and
clean
and
cheerful
as
the
morning
itself
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
punctual
,
"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
opening
the
door
to
him
in
reply
to
his
light
knock
,
which
had
roused
him
instantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
wishes
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Tapley
,
whose
mind
would
appear
from
the
context
to
have
been
running
on
the
matrimonial
service
,
"
is
to
love
,
honour
,
and
obey
.
 
<EOS>
The
clock
's
a
-
striking
now
,
sir
.
"
   
"
Come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Tapley
,
"
what
could
I
do
for
you
first
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
gave
my
message
to
Martin
?
"
said
the
old
man
,
bending
his
eyes
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mark
;
"
and
you
never
see
a
gentleman
more
surprised
in
all
your
born
days
than
he
was
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
more
did
you
tell
him
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
smiling
,
"
I
should
have
liked
to
tell
him
a
deal
more
,
but
not
being
able
,
sir
,
I
did
n't
tell
it
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
told
him
all
you
knew
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
precious
little
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
very
little
respectin
'
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
that
I
was
able
to
tell
him
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
mentioned
my
opinion
that
Mr
Pecksniff
would
find
himself
deceived
,
sir
,
and
that
you
would
find
yourself
deceived
,
and
that
he
would
find
himself
deceived
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
what
?
"
asked
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Meaning
him
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Meaning
both
him
and
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
your
old
opinions
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
As
to
him
,
sir
,
and
his
opinions
,
I
know
he
's
a
altered
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
long
afore
he
spoke
to
you
t'other
day
,
and
I
must
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
do
n't
know
half
as
much
of
him
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
ca
n't
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
always
a
deal
of
good
in
him
,
but
a
little
of
it
got
crusted
over
,
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
who
rolled
the
paste
of
that
'
ere
crust
myself
,
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
"
Go
on
,
"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
stop
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
it
---
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
I
think
it
may
have
been
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Unintentional
<EOS>
I
think
it
may
have
been
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
that
neither
of
you
gave
the
other
quite
a
fair
chance
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Now
I
've
got
rid
on
it
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
in
a
fit
of
desperation
:
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
go
a
-
carryin
'
it
about
in
my
own
mind

bustin

myself
with
it
;
yesterday
was
quite
long

.
 
<EOS>
It
's
out
now

<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help

.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
wisit
on
him
,
sir
,
that
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
Mark
expected
to
be
ordered
out
immediately
,
and
was
quite
prepared
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
think
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
that
his
old
faults
are
,
in
some
degree
,
of
my
creation
,
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mr
Tapley
,
"
I
'm
werry
sorry
,
but
I
ca
n't
unsay
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
hardly
fair
of
you
,
sir
,
to
make
a
ignorant
man
conwict
himself
in
this
way
,
but
I
DO
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
respectful
<EOS>
disposed
to
you
,
sir
,
as
a
man
can
be
;
but
I
DO
think
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
light
of
a
faint
smile
seemed
to
break
through
the
dull
steadiness
of
Martin
's
face
,
as
he
looked
attentively
at
him
,
without
replying
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yet
you
are
an
ignorant
man
<EOS>
,
you
say
,
"
he
observed
after
a
long
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Werry
much
so
,
"
Mr
Tapley
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
a
learned
,
well
-
instructed
man
,
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Likewise
wery
much
so
,
"
Mr
Tapley
answered
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
,
paced
the
room
twice
or
thrice
before
he
added
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
left
him
this
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
straight
from
him
now
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
what
does
he
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
know
what
to
suppose
,
sir
,
no
more
than
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
jest
wot
passed
yesterday
,
sir
,
and
that
you
had
said
to
me
,
"
Can
you
be
here
by
seven
in
the
morning
?
"
<EOS>
and
that
you
had
said
to
him
,
through
me
,
"
Can
you
be
here
by
ten
in
the
morning
?
<EOS>
"
and
that
I
had
said
"
Yes
"
to
both
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
frankness
was
so
genuine
that
it
plainly
WAS
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
he
may
think
you
are
going
to
desert
him
,
and
to
serve
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
served
him
in
that
sort
of
way
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mark
,
without
the
loss
of
any
atom
of
his
self
-
possession
;
"
and
we
have
been
that
sort
of
companions
in
misfortune
,
that
my
opinion
is
,
he
do
n't
believe
a
word
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
than
you
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
help
me
to
dress
,
and
get
me
some
breakfast
from
the
hotel
?
"
asked
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
pleasure
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
by
-
and
-
bye
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
remaining
in
the
room
,
as
I
wish
you
to
do
,
will
you
attend
to
the
door
yonder
---
give
admission
to
visitors
,
I
mean
,
when
they
knock
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
it
necessary
to
express
surprise
at
their
appearance
,
"
Martin
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
no
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
"
not
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
Although
he
pledged
himself
to
this
with
perfect
confidence
,
he
was
in
a
state
of
unbounded
astonishment
even
now
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
appeared
to
observe
it
,
and
to
have
some
sense
of
the
ludicrous
bearing
of
Mr
Tapley
under
these
perplexing
circumstances
;
for
,
in
spite
of
the
composure
of
his
voice
and
the
gravity
of
his
face
,
the
same
indistinct
light
flickered
on
the
latter
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
bestirred
himself
,
however
,
to
execute
the
offices
with
which
he
was
entrusted
;
and
soon
lost
all
tendency
to
any
outward
expression
of
his
surprise
,
in
the
occupation
of
being
brisk
and
busy
.
   
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
put
Mr
Chuzzlewit
's
clothes
in
good
order
for
dressing
,
and
when
that
gentleman
was
dressed
and
sitting
at
his
breakfast
,
Mr
Tapley
's
feelings
of
wonder
began
to
return
upon
him
with
great
violence
;
and
,
standing
beside
the
old
man
with
a
napkin
under
his
arm
(
it
was
as
natural
and
easy
to
joke
to
Mark
to
be
a
butler
in
the
Temple
,
as
it
had
been
to
volunteer
as
cook
on
board
the
Screw
)
,
he
found
it
difficult
to
resist
the
temptation
of
casting
sidelong
glances
at
him
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
found
it
impossible
;
and
accordingly
yielded
to
this
impulse
so
often
,
that
Martin
caught
him
in
the
fact
some
fifty
times
.
 
<EOS>
The
extraordinary
things
Mr
Tapley
did
with
his
own
face
when
any
of
these
detections
occurred
;
the
sudden
occasions
he
had
to
rub
his
eyes
or
his
nose
or
his
chin
;
the
look
of
wisdom
with
which
he
immediately
plunged
into
the
deepest
thought
,
or
became
intensely
interested
in
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
flies
upon
the
ceiling
,
or
the
sparrows
out
of
doors
;
or
the
overwhelming
politeness
with
which
he
endeavoured
to
hide
his
confusion
by
handing
the
muffin
;
may
not
unreasonably
be
assumed
to
have
exercised
the
utmost
power
of
feature
that
even
Martin
Chuzzlewit
the
elder
possessed
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
sat
perfectly
quiet
and
took
his
breakfast
at
his
leisure
,
or
made
a
show
of
doing
so
,
for
he
scarcely
ate
or
drank
,
and
frequently
lapsed
into
long
intervals
of
musing
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
finished
,
Mark
sat
down
to
his
breakfast
at
the
same
table
;
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
quite
silent
still
,
walked
up
and
down
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
cleared
away
in
due
course
,
and
set
a
chair
out
for
him
,
in
which
,
as
the
time
drew
on
towards
ten
o'clock
,
he
took
his
seat
,
leaning
his
hands
upon
his
stick
,
and
clenching
them
upon
the
handle
,
and
resting
his
chin
on
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
All
his
impatience
and
abstraction
of
manner
had
vanished
now
;
and
as
he
sat
there
,
looking
,
with
his
keen
eyes
,
steadily
towards
the
door
,
Mark
could
not
help
thinking
what
a
firm
,
square
,
powerful
face
it
was
;
or
exulting
in
the
thought
that
Mr
Pecksniff
,
after
playing
a
pretty
long
game
of
bowls
with
its
owner
,
seemed
to
be
at
last
in
a
very
fair
way
of
coming
in
for
a
rubber
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
's
uncertainty
in
respect
of
what
was
going
to
be
done
or
said
,
and
by
whom
to
whom
,
would
have
excited
him
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
But
knowing
for
a
certainty
besides
,
that
young
Martin
was
coming
,
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
must
arrive
<EOS>
,
he
found
it
by
no
means
easy
to
remain
quiet
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
excepting
that
he
occasionally
coughed
in
a
hollow
and
unnatural
manner
to
relieve
himself
,
he
behaved
with
great
decorum
through
the
longest
ten
minutes
he
had
ever
known
.
   
<EOS>
A
knock
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Westlock
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tapley
,
in
admitting
him
,
raised
his
eyebrows
to
the
highest
possible
pitch
,
implying
thereby
that
he
considered
himself
in
an
unsatisfactory
position
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
received
him
very
courteously
.
   
<EOS>
Mark
waited
at
the
door
for
Tom
Pinch
and
his
sister
,
who
were
coming
up
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
went
to
meet
them
;
took
their
hands
in
his
;
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
looked
promising
,
Mr
Tapley
smiled
benignantly
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
had
resumed
his
chair
before
young
Martin
,
who
was
close
behind
them
,
entered
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
scarcely
looking
at
him
,
pointed
to
a
distant
seat
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
less
encouraging
;
and
Mr
Tapley
's
spirits
fell
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
quickly
summoned
to
the
door
by
another
knock
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
start
,
or
cry
,
or
tumble
down
,
at
sight
of
Miss
Graham
and
Mrs
Lupin
,
but
he
drew
a
very
long
breath
,
and
came
back
perfectly
resigned
,
looking
on
them
and
on
the
rest
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
nothing
could
surprise
him
any
more
;
and
that
he
was
rather
glad
to
have
done
with
that
sensation
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
received
Mary
no
less
tenderly
than
he
had
received
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
.
 
<EOS>
A
look
of
friendly
recognition
passed
between
himself
and
Mrs
Lupin
,
which
implied
the
existence
of
a
perfect
understanding
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
engendered
no
astonishment
in
Mr
Tapley
;
for
,
as
he
afterwards
observed
,
he
had
retired
from
the
business
,
and
sold
off
the
stock
.
   
<EOS>
Not
the
least
curious
feature
in
this
assemblage
was
,
that
everybody
present
was
so
much
surprised
and
embarrassed
by
the
sight
of
everybody
else
,
that
nobody
ventured
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
alone
broke
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Set
the
door
open
,
Mark
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
"
and
come
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mark
obeyed
.
   
<EOS>
The
last
appointed
footstep
sounded
now
upon
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Pecksniff
's
;
and
Mr
Pecksniff
was
in
a
hurry
too
,
for
he
came
bounding
up
with
such
uncommon
expedition
that
he
stumbled
twice
or
thrice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
my
venerable
friend
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
upon
the
upper
landing
;
and
then
with
open
arms
came
darting
in
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
merely
looked
at
him
;
but
Mr
Pecksniff
started
back
as
if
he
had
received
the
charge
from
an
electric
battery
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
venerable
friend
is
well
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Pecksniff
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
reassure
the
anxious
inquirer
.
 
<EOS>
He
clasped
his
hands
and
,
looking
upwards
with
a
pious
joy
,
silently
expressed
his
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
looked
round
on
the
assembled
group
,
and
shook
his
head
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
For
such
a
man
severely
,
quite
severely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
vermin
!
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
bloodsuckers
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
enough
that
you
have
embittered
the
existence
of
an
individual
wholly
unparalleled
in
the
biographical
records
of
amiable
persons
,
but
must
you
now
,
even
now
,
when
he
has
made
his
election
,
and
reposed
his
trust
in
a
Numble
,
but
at
least
sincere
and
disinterested
relative
;
must
you
now
,
vermin
and
swarmers
(
I
regret
to
make
use
of
these
strong
expressions
,
my
dear
sir
,
but
there
are
times
when
honest
indignation
will
not
be
controlled
)
,
must
you
now
,
vermin
and
swarmers
(
for
I
WILL
repeat
it
)
,
take
advantage
of
his
unprotected
state
,
assemble
round
him
from
all
quarters
,
as
wolves
and
vultures
,
and
other
animals
of
the
feathered
tribe
assemble
round
---
I
will
not
say
round
carrion
or
a
carcass
,
for
Mr
Chuzzlewit
is
quite
the
contrary
---
but
round
their
prey
;
their
prey
;
to
rifle
and
despoil
;
gorging
their
voracious
maws
,
and
staining
their
offensive
beaks
,
with
every
description
of
carnivorous
enjoyment
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
stopped
to
fetch
his
breath
,
he
waved
them
off
,
in
a
solemn
manner
,
with
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Horde
of
unnatural
plunderers
and
robbers
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
;
"
leave
him
!
<EOS>
leave
him
,
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
Begone
!
 
<EOS>
Abscond
!
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
be
off
!
<EOS>
Wander
over
the
face
of
the
earth
,
young
sirs
,
like
vagabonds
as
you
are
,
and
do
not
presume
to
remain
in
a
spot
which
is
hallowed
by
the
grey
hairs
of
the
patriarchal
gentleman
to
whose
tottering
limbs
<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
to
act
as
an
unworthy
,
but
I
hope
an
unassuming
,
prop
and
staff
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
,
my
tender
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
addressing
himself
in
a
tone
of
gentle
remonstrance
to
the
old
man
,
"
how
could
you
ever
leave
me
,
though
even
for
this
short
period
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
absented
yourself
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
doubt
,
upon
some
act
of
kindness
to
me
;
bless
you
for
it
;
but
you
must
not
do
it
;
you
must
not
be
so
venturesome
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
really
be
angry
with
you
if
I
could
,
my
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
advanced
with
outstretched
arms
to
take
the
old
man
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
seen
how
the
hand
clasped
and
clutched
the
stick
within
its
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
came
smiling
on
,
and
got
within
his
reach
,
old
Martin
,
with
his
burning
indignation
crowded
into
one
vehement
burst
,
and
flashing
out
of
every
line
and
wrinkle
in
his
face
,
rose
up
,
and
struck
him
down
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
With
such
a
well
-
directed
nervous
blow
,
that
down
he
went
,
as
heavily
and
true
as
if
the
charge
of
a
Life
-
Guardsman
had
tumbled
him
out
of
a
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
And
whether
he
was
stunned
by
the
shock
,
or
only
confused
by
the
wonder
and
novelty
of
this
warm
reception
,
he
did
not
offer
to
get
up
again
;
but
lay
there
,
looking
about
him
with
a
disconcerted
meekness
in
his
face
so
enormously
ridiculous
,
that
neither
Mark
Tapley
nor
John
Westlock
could
repress
a
smile
,
though
both
were
actively
interposing
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
blow
;
which
the
old
man
's
gleaming
eyes
and
vigorous
attitude
seemed
to
render
one
of
the
most
probable
events
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drag
him
away
!
 
<EOS>
Take
him
out
of
my
reach
!
"
<EOS>
said
Martin
;
"
or
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
strong
restraint
I
have
put
upon
my
hands
has
been
enough
to
palsy
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
master
of
myself
while
he
is
within
their
range
.
 
<EOS>
Drag
him
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
Seeing
that
he
still
did
not
rise
,
Mr
Tapley
,
without
any
compromise
about
it
,
actually
did
drag
him
away
,
and

him

floor

"
Hear
me
,
rascal
!
"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
summoned
you
here
to
witness
your
own
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
summoned
you
here
to
witness
it
,
because
I
know
it
will
be
gall
and
wormwood
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
summoned
you
here
to
witness
it
,
because
I
know
the
sight
of
everybody
here
must
be
a
dagger
in
your
mean
,
false
heart
!
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
do
you
know
me
as
I
am
,
at
last
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
had
cause
to
stare
at
him
,
for
the
triumph
in
his
face
and
speech
and
figure
was
a
sight
to
stare
at
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
there
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
old
man
,
pointing
at
him
,
and
appealing
to
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
there
!
 
<EOS>
And
then
---
come
hither
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Martin
---
look
here
!
<EOS>
here
!
<EOS>
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
every
repetition
of
the
word
he
pressed
his
grandson
closer
to
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
passion
I
felt
,
Martin
,
when
I
dared
not
do
this
,
"
he
said
,
"
was
in
the
blow
I
struck
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
we
ever
part
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
we
ever
part
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
you
ever
fly
from
me
to
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Martin
was
about
to
answer
,
but
he
stopped
him
,
and
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
fault
was
mine
no
less
than
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
has
told
me
so
today
,
and
I
have
known
it
long
;
though
not
so
long
as
I
might
have
done
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
my
love
,
come
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
trembled
and
was
very
pale
,
he
sat
her
in
his
own
chair
,
and
stood
beside
it
with
her
hand
in
his
;
and
Martin
standing
by
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
curse
of
our
house
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
looking
kindly
down
upon
her
,
"
has
been
the
love
of
self
;
has
ever
been
the
love
of
self
.
<EOS>
How
often
have
I
said
so
,
when
I
never
knew
that
I
had
wrought
it
upon
others
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
drew
one
hand
through
Martin
's
arm
,
and
standing
so
,
between
them
,
proceeded
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
all
know
how
I
bred
this
orphan
up
,
to
tend
me
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
you
can
know
by
what
degrees
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
regard
her
as
a
daughter
;
for
she
has
won
upon
me
,
by
her
self
-
forgetfulness
,
her
tenderness
,
her
patience
,
all
the
goodness
of
her
nature
,
when
Heaven
is
her
witness
that
I
took
but
little
pains
to
draw
it
forth
.
 
<EOS>
It
blossomed
without
cultivation
,
and
it
ripened
without
heat
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
say
that
I
am
sorry
for
it
now
,
or
yonder
fellow
might
be
holding
up
his
head
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
put
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
,
and
slightly
shook
that
part
of
him
to
which
allusion
had
been
made
;
as
if
to
signify
that
it
was
still
uppermost
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
kind
of
selfishness
,
"
said
Martin
---
"
I
have
learned
it
in
my
own
experience
of
my
own
breast
---
which
is
constantly
upon
the
watch
for
selfishness
in
others
;
and
holding
others
at
a
distance
,
by
suspicions
and
distrusts
,
wonders
why
they
do
n't
approach
,
and
do
n't
confide
,
and
calls
that
selfishness
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
I
once
doubted
those
about
me
---
not
without
reason
in
the
beginning
---
and
thus
I
once
doubted
you
,
Martin
.
"
   
"
Not
without
reason
,
"
Martin
answered
,
"
either
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
hypocrite

<EOS>
Listen

smooth
-
tongued
,
servile

<EOS>
crawling
knave

"
said
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
you
shallow
dog
.
 
<EOS>
What
!
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
seeking
him
,
you
had
already
spread
your
nets
;
you
were
already
fishing
for
him
,
were
ye
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
lay
ill
in
this
good
woman
's
house
and
your
meek
spirit
pleaded
for
my
grandson
,
you
had
already
caught
him
,
had
ye
?
 
<EOS>
Counting
on
the
restoration
of
the
love
you
knew
I
bore
him
,
you
designed
him
for
one
of
your
two
daughters
<EOS>
did
ye
?
 
<EOS>
Or
failing
that
,
you
traded
in
him
as
a
speculation
which
at
any
rate
should
blind
me
with
the
lustre
of
your
charity
,
and
found
a
claim
upon
me
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
even
then
I
knew
you
,
and
I
told
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
that
I
knew
you
,
even
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
angry
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
bear
a
great
deal
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
never
contradict
you
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Observe
!
"
<EOS>
said
Martin
,
looking
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
put
myself
in
that
man
's
hands
on
terms
as
mean
and
base
,
and
as
degrading
to
himself
,
as
I
could
render
them
in
words
.
 
<EOS>
I
stated
them
at
length
to
him
,
before
his
own
children
,
syllable
by
syllable
,
as
coarsely
as
I
could
,
and
with
as
much
offence
,
and
with
as
plain
an
exposition
of
my
contempt
,
as
words
---
not
looks
and
manner
merely
---
could
convey
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
only
called
the
angry
blood
into
his
face
,
I
would
have
wavered
in
my
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
only
stung
him
into
being
a
man
for
a
minute
I
would
have
abandoned
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
offered
me
one
word
of
remonstrance
,
in
favour
of
the
grandson
whom
he
supposed
I
had
disinherited
;
if
he
had
pleaded
with
me
,
though
never
so
faintly
,
against
my
appeal
to
him
to
abandon
him
to
misery
and
cast
him
from
his
house
;
I
think
I
could
have
borne
with
him
for
ever
afterwards
.
<EOS>
But
not
a
word
,
not
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Pandering
to
the
worst
of
human
passions
was
the
office
of
his
nature
;
and
faithfully
he
did
his
work
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
angry
,
"
observed
Mr
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
hurt

Mr

wounded

<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
resumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Once
resolved
to
try
him
,
I
was
resolute
to
pursue
the
trial
to
the
end
;
but
while
I
was
bent
on
fathoming
the
depth
of
his
duplicity
,
I
made
a
sacred
compact
with
myself
that
I
would
give
him
credit
on
the
other
side
for
any
latent
spark
of
goodness
,
honour
,
forbearance
---
any
virtue
---
that
might
glimmer
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
For
first
to

there
has
been
no
such
thing

<EOS>
Not
once

<EOS>
He
can
not
say
I
have
not
given
him
opportunity

<EOS>
He
can
not
say
I
have
ever
led
him
on

<EOS>
He
can
not
say
I
have
not
left
him
freely
to
himself
in
all
things
;
or
that
I
have
not
been
a
passive
instrument
in
his
hands
,
which
he
might
have
used
for
good
as
easily
as
evil
.
 
<EOS>
Or
if
he
can
,
he
Lies

that
's
his
nature

too

<EOS>
"
Mr
Chuzzlewit

"
interrupted
Pecksniff
,
shedding
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
angry

sir

<EOS>
I
can
not
be
angry
with
you

<EOS>
But
did
you
never
,
my
dear

express
a
desire
that
the
unnatural
young
man
who
by
his
wicked
arts
has
estranged
your
good
opinion
from
me
,
for
the

only
for

that
your

my

yourself

my
Christian
friend

<EOS>
"
I
have
said
so

have
I
not

"
retorted
the
old
man
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
tell
how
far
your
specious
hypocrisy
had
deceived
him

knave

and
knew
no
better
way
of
opening
his
eyes
than
by
presenting
you
before
him
in
your
own
servile
character

<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
express
that
desire

<EOS>
And
you
leaped
to
meet
it
;
and
you
met
it
;
and
turning
in
an
instant
on
the
hand
you
had
licked
and
beslavered
,
as
only
such
hounds
can
,
you
strengthened
,
and
confirmed
,
and
justified
me
in
my
scheme

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pecksniff
made
a
bow
;
a
submissive
,
not
to
say
a
grovelling
and
an
abject
bow
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
complimented
on
his
practice
of
the
loftiest
virtues
,
he
never
could
have
bowed
as
he
bowed
then
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
wretched
man

has
been
murdered

Mr
Chuzzlewit
went
on
to
say
;
"
then
passing
by
the
name

"
Tigg
,
"
suggested
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
Tigg
;
brought
begging
messages
to
me
on
behalf
of
a
friend
of
his

and
an
unworthy
relative
of
mine
;
and
finding
him
a
man
well
enough
suited
to
my
purpose
<EOS>
,
I
employed
him
to
glean
some
news
of
you
,
Martin
,
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
from
him
I
learned
that
you
had
taken
up
your
abode
with
yonder
fellow

<EOS>
It
was
he

who
meeting
you
here

one
evening

you
remember
where

<EOS>
"
At
the
pawnbroker

shop

said
Martin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

watched
you
to
your
lodging

and
enabled
me
to
send
you
a
bank
-
note
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
little
thought
,
"
said
Martin
,
greatly
moved
,
"
that
it
had
come
from
you
;
<EOS>
I
little
thought
that
you
were
interested
in
my
fate

<EOS>
If
I
had
---
"
   
"
If
you
had

returned
the
old
man
,
sorrowfully
,
"
you
would
have
shown
less
knowledge
of
me
as
I
seemed
to
be
,
and
as
I
really
was
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
to
bring
you
back
,
Martin
,
penitent
and
humbled

<EOS>
I
hoped
to
distress
you
into
coming
back
to
me

<EOS>
Much
as
I
loved
you
,
I
had
that
to
acknowledge
which
I
could
not
reconcile
it
to
myself
to
avow
,
then
,
unless
you
made
submission
to
me
first

<EOS>
Thus
it
was
I
lost
you

<EOS>
If
I
have
had
,
indirectly
,
any
act

part

the
fate

that
unhappy
man

by
putting
means

however
small

within
his
reach

Heaven
forgive
me

<EOS>
I
might
have
known
,
perhaps
,
that
he
would
misuse
money
;
that
it
was
ill
-
bestowed
upon
him
;
and
that
sown
by
his
hands
it
could
engender
mischief
only
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
thought
of
him
at
that
time
as
having
the
disposition
or
ability
to
be
a
serious
impostor
,
or
otherwise
than
as
a
thoughtless
,
idle
-
humoured
,
dissipated
spendthrift
,
sinning
more
against
himself

others

frequenting
low
haunts

indulging
vicious
tastes

ruin

Mr

Mrs

this

quite
agreeably

if
I

my

The
penance

have
done

said
Mr

has
earned
this
reflection

pleased

Oh

you
whose
wealth

like
mine

has
been
a
source
of
continual
unhappiness

leading
you
to
distrust
the
nearest

to
dig
yourself
a
living
grave

suspicion

reserve

take
heed
that

having
cast
off
all
whom
you
might
have
bound
to
you

tenderly

you
do
not
become
in
your
decay
the
instrument

such

in

wrong
or
<EOS>
you
could
ever
reach
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
then
he
told
them
how
he
had
sometimes
thought
,
in
the
beginning
,
that
love
might
grow
up
between
Mary
and
Martin
;
and
how
he
had
pleased
his
fancy
with
the
picture
of
observing
it
when
it
was
new
,
and
taking
them
to
task
,
apart
,
in
counterfeited
doubt
,
and
then
confessing
to
them
that
it
had
been
an
object
dear
to
his
heart
;
and
by
his
sympathy
with
them
,
and
generous
provision
for
their
young
fortunes
,
establishing
a
claim
on
their
affection
and
regard
which
nothing
should
wither
,
and
which
should
surround
his
old
age
with
means
of
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
How
in
the
first
dawn
of
this
design
,
and
when
the
pleasure
of
such
a
scheme
for
the
happiness
of
others
was
new
and
indistinct
within
him
,
Martin
had
come
to
tell
him
that
he
had
already
chosen
for
himself
;
knowing
that
he
,
the
old
man
,
had
some
faint
project
on
that
head
,
but
ignorant
whom
it
concerned
.
 
<EOS>
How
it
was
little
comfort
to
him
to
know
that
Martin
had
chosen
Her
,
because
the
grace
of
his
design
was
lost
,
and
because
finding
that
she
had
returned
his
love
,
he
tortured
himself
with
the
reflection
that
they
,
so
young
,
to
whom
he
had
been
so
kind
a
benefactor
,
were
already
like
the
world
,
and
bent
on
their
own
selfish
,
stealthy
ends
.
 
<EOS>
How
in
the
bitterness
of
this
impression
,
and
of
his
past
experience
,
he
had
reproached
Martin
so
harshly
(
forgetting
that
he
had
never
invited
his
confidence
on
such
a
point
,
and
confounding
what
he
had
meant
to
do
with
what
he
had
done
)
,
that
high
words
sprung
up
between
them
,
and
they
separated
in
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
loved
him
still
,
and
hoped
he
would
return
.
 
<EOS>
How
on
the
night
of
his
illness
at
the
Dragon
,
he
had
secretly
written
tenderly
of
him
,
and
made
him
his
heir
,
and
sanctioned
his
marriage
with
Mary
;
and
how
,
after
his
interview
with
Mr
Pecksniff
,
he
had
distrusted
him
again
,
and
burnt
the
paper
to
ashes
,
and
had
lain
down
in
his
bed
distracted
by
suspicions
,
doubts
,
and
regrets
.
   
<EOS>
And
then
he
told
them
how
,
resolved
to
probe
this
Pecksniff
,
and
to
prove
the
constancy
and
truth
of
Mary
(
to
himself
no
less
than
Martin
)
,
he
had
conceived
and
entered
on
his
plan
;
and
how
,
beneath
her
gentleness
and
patience
,
he
had
softened
more
and
more
;
still
more
and
more
beneath
the
goodness
and
simplicity
,
the
honour
and
the
manly
faith
of
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
spoke
of
Tom
,
he
said
God
bless
him
;
and
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
;
for
he
said
that
Tom
,
mistrusted
and
disliked
by
him
at
first
,
had
come
like
summer
rain
upon
his
heart
;
and
had
disposed
it
to
believe
in
better
things
.
<EOS>
And
Martin
took
him
by
the
hand
,
and
Mary
too
,
and
John
,
his
old
friend
,
stoutly
too
;
and
Mark
,
and
Mrs
Lupin
,
and
his
sister
,
little
Ruth
.
 
<EOS>
And
peace
of
mind
,
<EOS>
deep
,
tranquil
peace
of
mind
,
was
in
Tom
's
heart
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
then
related
how
nobly
Mr
Pecksniff
had
performed
the
duty
in
which
he
stood
indebted
to
society
,
in
the
matter
of
Tom
's
dismissal
;
and
how
,
having
often
heard
disparagement
of
Mr
Westlock
from
Pecksniffian
lips
,
and
knowing
him
to
be
a
friend
to
Tom
,
he
had
used
,
through
his
confidential
agent
and
solicitor
,
that
little
artifice
which
had
kept
him
in
readiness
to
receive
his
unknown
friend
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
called
on
Mr
Pecksniff
(
by
the
name
of
Scoundrel
)
to
remember
that
there
again
he
had
not
trapped
him
to
do
evil
,
but
that
he
had
done
it
of
his
own
free
will
and
agency
;
nay
,
that
he
had
cautioned
him
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
once
again
he
called
on
Mr
Pecksniff
<EOS>
(
by
the
name
of
Hang
-
dog
)
to
remember
that
when
Martin
coming
home
at
last
,
an
altered
man
,
had
sued
for
the
forgiveness
which
awaited
him
,
he
,
Pecksniff
,
had
rejected
him
in
language
of
his
own
,
and
had
remorsely
stepped
in
between
him
and
the
least
touch
of
natural
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
which
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
if
the
bending
of
my
finger
would
remove
a
halter
from
your
neck
,
I
would
n't
bend
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Martin
,
"
he
added
,
"
your
rival
has
not
been
a
dangerous
one
,
but
Mrs
Lupin
here
has
played
duenna
for
some
weeks
;
not
so
much
to
watch
your
love
as
to
watch
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
For
that
Ghoul
"
---
his
fertility
in
finding
names
for
Mr
Pecksniff
was
astonishing
---
"
would
have
crawled
into
her
daily
walks
otherwise
,
and
polluted
the
fresh
air
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
this
?
 
<EOS>
Her
hand
is
trembling
strangely
.
 
<EOS>
See
if
you
can
hold
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Hold
it
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
clasped
it
half
as
tightly
as
he
did
her
waist
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
   
<EOS>
But
it
was
good
in
him
that
even
then
,
in
his
high
fortune
and
happiness
,
with
her
lips
nearly
printed
on
his
own
,
and
her
proud
young
beauty
in
his
close
embrace
<EOS>
,
he
had
a
hand
still
left
to
stretch
out
to
Tom
Pinch
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
I
saw
you
,
accidentally
,
coming
here
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Forgive

"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
forgive
you
as
long
as
I
live

Martin
,
if
you
say
another
syllable
about
it

<EOS>
Joy

<EOS>
Joy

<EOS>
Joy
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
blessing
on

that
Tom
did
not
wish
them
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
blessing
on
earth
that
Tom
would
not
have
bestowed
upon
them
,
if
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,

,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
stepping
forward
,
"
<EOS>
but

just

<EOS>
"
A

Martin

"
It
seems

a

change
such

Tapley

<EOS>
Do

it

said
Mark
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That

upon
the

<EOS>
What
is
HER

<EOS>
"
Why

said
Mr
Tapley
,
retiring
,
with
a
bow
,
towards
the
buxom
hostess
,
"
her
opinion

"
   
<EOS>
The
whole
of
these
proceedings
were
so
agreeable
to
Mr
Pecksniff
that
he
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
and
his
hands
clasping
one
another
alternately
,
as
if
a
host
of
penal
sentences
were
being
passed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Not
only
did
his
figure
appear
to
have
shrunk
,
but
his
discomfiture
seemed
to
have
extended
itself
even
to
his
dress
.
 
<EOS>
His
clothes
seemed
to
have
grown
shabbier
,
his
linen
to
have
turned
yellow
,
his
hair
to
have
become
lank
and
frowsy
;
his
very
boots
looked
villanous
and
dim
,
as
if
their
gloss
had
departed
with
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
Feeling
,
rather
than
seeing
,
that
the
old
man
now
pointed
to
the
door
<EOS>
,
he
raised
his
eyes
,
picked
up
his
hat
,
and
thus
addressed
him
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
sir
!
<EOS>
you
have
partaken
of
my
hospitality
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
paid
for
it
,
"
he
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
That
savours
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
taking
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
"
of
your
old
familiar
frankness
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
paid
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
make
the
remark
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
deceived
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
see
you
in
the
possession
of
your
health
and
faculties
on
any
terms
,
is
,
in
itself
,
a
sufficient
recompense
.
 
<EOS>
To
have
been
deceived
implies
a
trusting
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
is
a
trusting
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
thankful
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
have
a
trusting
nature
,
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
sir
,
than
a
doubting
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pecksniff
,
with
a
sad
smile
,
bowed
,
and
wiped
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
hardly
any
person
present
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
said
Pecksniff
,
"
by
whom
I
have
not
been
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
forgiven
those
persons
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
my
duty
;
and
,
of
course
,
I
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
worthy
of
you
to
partake
of
my
hospitality
,
and
to
act
the
part
you
did
act
in
my
house
,
that
,
sir
,
is
a
question
which
I
leave
to
your
own
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
And
your
conscience
does
not
acquit
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
Pronouncing
these
last
words
in
a
loud
and
solemn
voice
,
Mr
Pecksniff
was
not
so
absolutely
lost
in
his
own
fervour
as
to
be
unmindful
of
the
expediency
of
getting
a
little
nearer
to
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
struck
this
day
,
"
said
Mr
Pecksniff
,
"
with
a
walking
stick
(
which
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
has
knobs
upon
it
)
,
on
that
delicate
and
exquisite
portion
of
the
human
anatomy
---
the
brain
.
<EOS>
Several
blows
have
been
inflicted
,
sir
,
without
a
walking
-
stick
,
upon
that
tenderer
portion
of
my
frame
---
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
mentioned
,
sir
,
my
being
bankrupt
in
my
purse
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
By
an
unfortunate
speculation
,
combined
with
treachery
,
I
find
myself
reduced
to
poverty
;
at
a
time
,
sir
,
when
the
child
of
my
bosom
is
widowed
,
and
affliction
and
disgrace
are
in
my
family
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Pecksniff
wiped
his
eyes
again
,
and
gave
himself
two
or
three
little
knocks
upon
the
breast
,
as
if
he
were
answering
two
or
three
other
little
knocks
from
within
,
given
by
the
tinkling
hammer
of
his
conscience
,
to
express
"
Cheer
up
,
my
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
human
mind
,
although
I
trust
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
my
weakness
.
<EOS>
Do
I
not
know
,
sir
"
---
here
he
became
exceedingly
plaintive
and
was
observed
to
glance
towards
Tom
Pinch
---
"
that
my
misfortunes
bring
this
treatment
on
me
?
 
<EOS>
Do
I
not
know
,
sir
,
that
but
for
them
I
never
should
have
heard
what
I
have
heard
to
-
day
?
 
<EOS>
Do
I
not
know
that
in
the
silence
and
the
solitude
of
night
,
a
little
voice
will
whisper
in
your
ear
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
<EOS>
This
was
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
not
well
,
sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
Think
of
this
,
sir
(
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
)
,
remote
from
the
impulses
of
passion
,
and
apart
from
the
specialities
,
if
I
may
use
that
strong
remark
,
of
prejudice
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
ever
contemplate
the
silent
tomb
,
sir
,
which
you
will
excuse
me
for
entertaining
some
doubt
of
your
doing
,
after
the
conduct
into
which
you
have
allowed
yourself
to
be
betrayed
this
day
;
if
you
ever
contemplate
the
silent
tomb
sir
,
think
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
find
yourself
approaching
to
the
silent
tomb
,
sir
,
think
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
wish
to
have
anything
inscribed
upon
your
silent
tomb
,
sir
,
let
it
be
,
that
I
---
ah
,
my
remorseful
sir
!
<EOS>
that
I
---
the
humble
individual
who
has
now
the
honour
of
reproaching
you
,
forgave
you
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
forgave
you
when
my
injuries
were
fresh
,
and
when
my
bosom
was
newly
wrung
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
bitterness
to
you
to
hear
it
now
,
sir
,
but
you
will
live
to
seek
a
consolation
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
May
you
find
a
consolation
in
it
when
you
want
it
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
sublime
address
,
Mr
Pecksniff
departed
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
effect
of
his
departure
was
much
impaired
by
his
being
immediately
afterwards
run
against
,
and
nearly
knocked
down
,
by
a
monstrously
excited
little
man
in
velveteen
shorts
and
a
very
tall
hat
;
who
came
bursting
up
the
stairs
,
and
straight
into
the
chambers
of
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
as
if
he
were
deranged
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
here
that
knows
him
?
"
cried
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
here
that
knows
him
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
stars
,
is
there
anybody
here
that
knows
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
looked
at
each
other
for
an
explanation
;
but
nobody
knew
anything
more
than
that
here
was
an
excited
little
man
with
a
very
tall
hat
on
,
running
in
and
out
of
the
room
as
hard
as
he
could
go
;
making
his
single
pair
of
bright
blue
stockings
appear
at
least
a
dozen
;
and
constantly
repeating
in
a
shrill
voice
,
"
IS
there
anybody
here
that
knows
him
?

"
If

exclaimed
another
voice
,
"
hold
that
there
nige
of
yourn
<EOS>

I
beg
you
,
sir

"
   
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
Mrs
Gamp
was
seen
in
the
doorway
;
out
of
breath
from
coming
up
so
many
stairs
,
and
panting
fearfully
;
but
dropping
curtseys
to
the
last
.
   
<EOS>
"
Excuge
the
weakness
of
the
man
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
eyeing
Mr
Sweedlepipe
with
great
indignation
;
"
and
<EOS>
well
I
might
expect
it
,
as
I
should
have
know'd
,
and
wishin
'
he
was
drownded
in
the
Thames
afore
<EOS>
I
had
brought
him
here
,
which
not
a
blessed
hour
ago
he
nearly
shaved
the
noge
off
from
the
father
of
as
lovely
a
family
as
ever
<EOS>
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
was
born
three
sets
of
twins

and
would
have
done
it
,
only
he

it
a

goin

dodged
the

And
never

Mr
Sweedlepipes

I

I
<EOS>
so

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
ladies
and
gentlemen

cried
the
little
barber
,
taking
off
his
hat
,
"
and
yours
too
,
Mrs
Gamp

<EOS>
But
<EOS>

he
added
this
half
laughing
and
half
crying
,
"
IS
there
anybody
here
that
knows
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
barber
said
these
words
,
a
something
in
top
-
boots
,
with
its
head
bandaged
up
,
staggered
into
the
room
,
and
began
going
round
and
round
and
round
,
apparently
under
the
impression
that
it
was
walking
straight
forward

<EOS>
"

the

cried
the

actually
sobbing
over

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
had
observed
,
not
without
jealousy
and
scorn
,
that
a
favourable
impression
appeared
to
exist
in
behalf
of
Mr
Sweedlepipe
and
his
young
friend
;
and
that
she
had
fallen
rather
into
the
background
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
struggled
to
the
front
,
therefore
,
and
stated
her
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
she
said
,
"
is
well
beknown
to
Mrs
Harris
as
has
one
sweet
infant
(
though
she
DO
not
wish
it
known
)
in
her
own
family
by
the
mother
's
side
,
kep
in
spirits
in
a
bottle
;
and
that
sweet
babe
she
see
at
Greenwich
Fair

a

travelling
in
company
with
a
pink

eyed
lady
,
Prooshan

and
livin

skelinton

which
judge
her
feelings
when
the
barrel
organ
played

and
<EOS>
she
was
showed
her
own
dear
sister
's
child
,
the
same
not
bein

expected
from
the

picter

where
it
was
painted
quite
contrairy
in
a
livin

state

a
many
sizes
larger

and
performing
beautiful
upon
the
Arp

which
never
did
that
dear
child
know
or
do

since
breathe
it
never
did

to
speak
on
in
this
wale

<EOS>
And
Mrs
Harris
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
has
knowed
me
many
year
,
and
can
give
you
information
that
the
lady
which
is
widdered
ca
n't
do
better

may
do
worse

let

wait

I
hope
to
do

Permittin

the
sweet

I
see

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
business
?
 
<EOS>
Was
this
good
person
paid
for
the
trouble
we
gave
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
paid
her
,

"
returned
Mark
Tapley
;
"
liberal
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
young
man
's
words
is
true
,
"
said
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
and
thank
you
kindly

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
here
we
will
close
our
acquaintance
,
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
retorted
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
Mr
Sweedlepipe
---
is
that
your
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
name
,
sir
,
"
replied
Poll
,
accepting
with
a
profusion
of
gratitude
,
some
chinking
pieces
which
the
old
man
slipped
into
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Sweedlepipe
,
take
as
much
care
of
your
lady
-
lodger
as
you
can
,
and
give
her
a
word
or
two
of
good
advice
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
Such
,
"
said
old
Martin
,
looking
gravely
at
the
astonished
Mrs
Gamp
,
"
as
hinting
at
the
expediency
of
a
little
less
liquor
,
and
a
little
more
humanity
,
and
a
little
less
regard
for
herself
,
and
a
little
more
regard
for
her
patients
,
and
perhaps
a
trifle
of
additional
honesty
.
<EOS>
Or
when
Mrs
Gamp
gets
into
trouble
,
Mr
Sweedlepipe
,
it
had
better
not
be
at
a
time
when
I
am
near
enough
to
the
Old
Bailey
to
volunteer
myself
as
a
witness
to
her
character
.
 
<EOS>
Endeavour
to
impress
that
upon
her
at
your
leisure
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gamp
clasped
her
hands
,
turned
up
her
eyes
until
they
were
quite
invisible
,
threw
back
her
bonnet
for
the
admission
of
fresh
air
to
her
heated
brow
;
and
in
the
act
of
saying
faintly
---
"
<EOS>
Less
liquor
!
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
Sairey
Gamp
---
<EOS>
Bottle
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
let
me
put
my
lips
to
it
,
when
I
am
so
dispoged
!
"
---
fell
into
one
of
the
walking
swoons
;
in
which
pitiable
state
she
was
conducted
forth
by
Mr
Sweedlepipe
,
who
,
between
his
two
patients
,
the
swooning
Mrs
Gamp
and
the
revolving
Bailey
,
had
enough
to
do
,
poor
fellow
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
about
him
,
with
a
smile
,
until
his
eyes
rested
on
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
;
when
he
smiled
the
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
all
dine
here
together
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
as
you
and
Mary
have
enough
to
talk
of
,
Martin
,
you
shall
keep
house
for
us
until
the
afternoon
,
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
see
your
lodgings
in
the
meanwhile
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
quite
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
So
was
Ruth
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
go
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
afraid
I
must
take
Tom
a
little
out
of
the
way
,
on
business
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
you
go
on
first
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Pretty
little
Ruth
was
equally
delighted
to
do
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
not
alone
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
not
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Westlock
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
will
escort
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Why
,
of
course
he
would
:
what
else
had
Mr
Westlock
in
his
mind
?
 
<EOS>
How
dull
these
old
men
are
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
you
have
no
engagement
?
"
<EOS>
he
persisted
.
   
<EOS>
Engagement
!
 
<EOS>
As
if
he
could
have
any
engagement
!
   
<EOS>
So
they
went
off
arm
-
in
-
arm
.
 
<EOS>
When
Tom
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
went
off
arm
-
in
-
arm
a
few
minutes
after
them
,
the
latter
was
still
smiling
;
and
really
,
for
a
gentleman
of
his
habits
,
in
rather
<EOS>
a
knowing
manner
.

Chapter

<EOS>
What
John
Westlock
said
to
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
;
what
Tom
Pinch
's
sister
said
to
John
Westlock
;
what
Tom
Pinch
said
to
both
of
them
;
And
how
they
all
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
 
Brilliantly
the
Temple
Fountain
sparkled
in
the
sun
,
and
laughingly
its
liquid
music
played
,
and
merrily
the
idle
drops
of
water
danced
and
danced
,
and
peeping
out
in
sport
among
the
trees
,
plunged
lightly
down
to
hide
themselves
,
as
little
Ruth
and
her
companion
came
toward
it
.
   
<EOS>
And
why
they
came
toward
the
Fountain
at
all
<EOS>
is
a
mystery
;
for
they
had
no
business
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
out
of
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
Fountain
,
bless
you
,
than
they
had
with
---
with
Love
,
or
any
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
thing
of
that
sort
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
for
Tom
and
his
sister
to
make
appointments
by
the
Fountain
,
but
that
was
quite
another
affair
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
of
course
,
when
she
had
to
wait
a
minute
or
two
,
it
would
have
been
very
awkward
for
her
to
have
had
to
wait
in
any
but
a
tolerably
quiet
spot
;
but
that
was
as
quiet
a
spot
,
everything
considered
,
as
they
could
choose
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
had
John
Westlock
to
take
care
of
her
,
and
was
going
home
with
her
arm
in
his
(
home
being
in
a
different
direction
altogether
)
,
their
coming
anywhere
near
that
Fountain
was
quite
extraordinary
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
there
they
found
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
And
another
extraordinary
part
of
the
matter
was
,
that
they
seemed
to
have
come
there
,
by
a
silent
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
when
they
got
there
,
they
were
a
little
confused
by
being
there
,
which
was
the
strangest
part
of
all
;
because
there
is
nothing
naturally
confusing
in
a
Fountain
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
.
   
<EOS>
What
a
good
old
place
it
was
!
<EOS>
John
said
.
 
<EOS>
With
quite
an
earnest
affection
for
it
   
<EOS>
"
A
pleasant
place
indeed
,
"
said
little
Ruth
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
shady
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
wicked
little
Ruth
!
   
<EOS>
They
came
to
a
stop
when
John
began
to
praise
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
was
exquisite
;
and
stopping
at
all
,
it
was
quite
natural
---
nothing
could
be
more
so
---
that
they
should
glance
down
Garden
Court
;
because
Garden
Court
ends
in
the
Garden
,
and
the
Garden
ends
in
the
River
,
and
that
glimpse
is
very
bright
and
fresh
and
shining
on
a
summer
's
day
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
oh
,
little
Ruth
,
why
not
look
boldly
at
it
!
 
<EOS>
Why
fit
that
tiny
,
precious
,
blessed
little
foot
into
the
cracked
corner
of
an
insensible
old
flagstone
in
the
pavement
;
and
be
so
very
anxious
to
adjust
it
to
a
nicety
!
   
<EOS>
If
the
Fiery
-
faced
matron
in
the
crunched
bonnet
could
have
seen
them
as
they
walked
away
,
how
many
years
'
purchase
might
Fiery
Face
have
been
disposed
to
take
for
her
situation
in
Furnival
's
Inn
as
laundress
to
Mr
Westlock
!
   
<EOS>
They
went
away
,
but
not
through
London
's
streets
!
 
<EOS>
Through
some
enchanted
city
,
where
the
pavements
were
of
air
;
where
all
the
rough
sounds
of
a
stirring
town
were
softened
into
gentle
music
;
where
everything
was
happy
;
where
there
was
no
distance
,
and
no
time
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
good
-
tempered
burly
draymen
letting
down
big
butts
of
beer
into
a
cellar
,
somewhere
;
and
when
John
helped
her
---
almost
lifted
her
---
the
lightest
,
easiest
,
neatest
thing
you
ever
saw
---
 
across
the
rope
,
they
said
he
owed
them
a
good
turn
for
giving
him
the
chance
.
 
<EOS>
Celestial
draymen
!
   
<EOS>
Green
pastures
in
the
summer
tide
,
deep
-
littered
straw
yards
in
the
winter
,
no
start
of
corn
and
clover
,
ever
,
to
that
noble
horse
who
WOULD
dance
on
the
pavement
with
a
gig
behind
him
,
and
who
frightened
her
,
and
made
her
clasp
his
arm
with
both
hands
(
both
hands
meeting
one
upon
the
another
so
endearingly
!
)
,
and
caused
her
to
implore
him
to
take
refuge
in
the
pastry
-
cook
's
,
and
afterwards
to
peep
out
at
the
door
so
shrinkingly
;
and
then
,
looking
at
him
with
those
eyes
,
to
ask
him
was
he
sure
---
<EOS>
now
was
he
sure
---
they
might
go
safely
on
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
for
a
string
of
rampant
horses
!
 
<EOS>
For
a
lion
,
for
a
bear

for
a
mad
bull

anything

bring
the
little
hands
together
on
his
arm
again
!
   
<EOS>
They
talked
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
They
talked
of
Tom
,
and
all
these
changes
and
the
attachment
Mr
Chuzzlewit
had
conceived
for
him
,
and
the
bright
prospects
he
had
in
such
a
friend
,
and
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
they
talked
,
the
more
afraid
this
fluttering
little
Ruth
became
of
any
pause
;
and
sooner
than
have
a
pause
<EOS>
she
would
say
the
same
things
over
again
;
and
if
she
had
n't
courage
or
presence
of
mind
enough
for
that
(
to
say
the
truth
she
very
seldom
had
)
,
she
was
ten
thousand
times
more
charming
and
irresistible
than
she
had
been
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martin
will
be
married
very
soon
now
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
John
.
   
<EOS>
She
supposed
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
Never
did
a
bewitching
<EOS>
little
woman
suppose
anything
in
such
a
faint
voice
as
Ruth
supposed
that
.
   
<EOS>
But
seeing
that
another
of
those
alarming
pauses
was
approaching
,
she
remarked
that
he
would
have
a
beautiful
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
Mr
Westlock
think
so
?
   
<EOS>
"
Ye
---
<EOS>
yes
,
"
said
John
,
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
feared
he
was
rather
hard
to
please
,
he
spoke
so
coldly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rather
say
already
pleased
,
"
said
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
scarcely
seen
her
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
care
to
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
eyes
for
HER
,
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
good
gracious
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
well
they
had
reached
their
destination
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
could
have
gone
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
impossible
to
walk
in
such
a
tremble
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
had
not
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
They
entered
the
triangular
parlour
together
,
and
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Fiery
Face
,
Fiery
Face
,
how
many
years
'
purchase
NOW
!
   
<EOS>
She
sat
down
on
the
little
sofa
,
and
untied
her
bonnet
-
strings
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
by
her
side
,
and
very
near
her
;
very
,
very
near
her
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
rapid
,
swelling
,
bursting
little
heart
,
you
knew
that
it
would
come
to
this
,
and
hoped
it
would
.
 
<EOS>
Why
beat
so
wildly
,
heart
!
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Ruth
!
 
<EOS>
Sweet
Ruth
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
loved
you
less
,
I
could
have
told
you
that
I
loved
you
,
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
loved
you
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
creature
in
the
world
more
truly
loved
than
you
,
dear
Ruth
,
by
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
clasped
her
little
hands
before
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
gushing
tears
of
joy
,
and
pride
,
and
hope
,
and
innocent
affection
,
would
not
be
restrained
.
 
<EOS>
Fresh
from
her
full
young
heart
they
came
to
answer
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
love
!
 
<EOS>
If
this
is
---
I
almost
dare
to
hope
it
is
,
now
---
not
painful
or
distressing
to
you
<EOS>
,
you
make
me
happier
than
I
can
tell
,
or
you
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
Darling
Ruth
!
 
<EOS>
My
own
good
,
gentle
,
winning
Ruth
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
know
the
value
of
your
heart
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
know
the
worth
of
your
angel
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
try
and
show
you
that
I
do
;
and
you
will
make
me
happier
,
Ruth
---
"
   
"
Not
happier
,
"
she
sobbed
,
"
than
you
make
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
can
be
happier
,
John
,
than
you
make
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Fiery
Face
,
provide
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
The
usual
wages
or
the
usual
warning
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
over
,
Fiery
Face
.
 
<EOS>
We
need
n't
trouble
you
any
further
.
   
<EOS>
The
little
hands
could
meet
each
other
now
,
without
a
rampant
horse
to
urge
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
occasion
for
lions
,
bears
,
or
mad
bulls
.
<EOS>
It
could
all
be
done
,
and
infinitely
better
,
without
their
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
No
burly
drayman
or
big
butts
of
beer
,
were
wanted
for
apologies
.
 
<EOS>
No
apology
at
all
was
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
The
soft
light
touch
fell
coyly
,
but
quite
naturally
,
upon
the
lover
's
shoulder
;
the
delicate
waist
,
the
drooping
head
,
the
blushing
cheek
,
the
beautiful
eyes
,
the
exquisite
mouth
itself
,
were
all
as
natural
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
If
all
the
horses
in
Araby
had
run
away
at
once
,
they
could
n't
have
improved
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
They
soon
began
to
talk
of
Tom
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
be
glad
to
hear
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
John
,
with
sparkling
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
Ruth
drew
the
little
hands
a
little
tighter
when
he
said
it
,
and
looked
up
seriously
into
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
never
to
leave
him
,
AM
I
,
dear
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
never
leave
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
would
ask
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
returned
,
with
a
---
well
!
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
with
what
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
never
would
,
"
she
answered
,
the
bright
tears
standing
in
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
will
swear
it
,
Ruth
,
my
darling
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
Tom
!
<EOS>
That
would
be
a
strange
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
Tom
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
If
Tom
and
we
be
not
inseparable
,
and
Tom
(
God
bless
him
)
have
not
all
honour
and
all
love
in
our
home
,
my
little
wife
,
may
that
home
never
be
!
 
<EOS>
And
that
's
a
strong
oath
,
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Shall
it
be
recorded
how
she
thanked
him
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
shall
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
simplicity
and
innocence
and
purity
of
heart
,
yet
with
a
timid
,
graceful
,
half
-
determined
hesitation
,
she
set
a
little
rosy
seal
upon
the
vow
,
whose
colour
was
reflected
in
her
face
,
and
flashed
up
to
the
braiding
of
her
dark
brown
hair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
will
be
so
happy
,
and
so
proud
,
and
glad
,
"
she
said
,
clasping
her
little
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
so
surprised
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
Of
course
John
asked
her
immediately
---
because
you
know
they
were
in
that
foolish
state
when
great
allowances
must
be
made
---
when
SHE
had
begun
to
think
of
such
a
thing
,
and
this
made
a
little
diversion
in
their
talk
;
a
charming
diversion
to
them
,
but
not
so
interesting
to
us
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
they
came
back
to
Tom
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
dear
Tom
!
"
said
Ruth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
ought
to
tell
you
everything
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
no
secrets
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
,
John
,
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
of
no
use
saying
how
that
preposterous
John
answered
her
,
because
he
answered
in
a
manner
which
is
untranslatable
on
paper
though
highly
satisfactory
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
he
conveyed
was
,
No
no
no
,
sweet
Ruth
;
or
something
to
that
effect
.
   
<EOS>
Then
she
told
him
Tom
's
great
secret
;
not
exactly
saying
how
she
had
found
it
out
,
but
leaving
him
to
understand
it
if
he
liked
;
and
John
was
sadly
grieved
to
hear
it
,
and
was
full
of
sympathy
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
But
they
would
try
,
he
said
,
only
the
more
,
on
this
account
to
make
him
happy
,
and
to
beguile
him
with
his
favourite
pursuits
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
all
the
confidence
of
such
a
time
,
he
told
her
how
he
had
a
capital
opportunity
of
establishing
himself
in
his
old
profession
in
the
country
;
and
how
he
had
been
thinking
,
in
the
event
of
that
happiness
coming
upon
him
which
had
actually
come
---
there
was
another
slight
diversion
here
<EOS>
---
how
he
had
been
thinking
that
it
would
afford
occupation
to
Tom
,
and
enable
them
to
live
together
in
the
easiest
manner
,
without
any
sense
of
dependence
on
Tom
's
part
;
and
to
be
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
.
 
<EOS>
And
Ruth
receiving
this
with
joy
,
they
went
on
catering
for
Tom
to
that
extent
that
they
had
already
purchased
him
a
select
library
and
built
him
an
organ
,
on
which
he
was
performing
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
,
when
they
heard
him
knocking
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Though
she
longed
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
,
poor
little
Ruth
was
greatly
agitated
by
his
arrival
;
the
more
so
because
she
knew
that
Mr
Chuzzlewit
was
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
said
,
all
in
a
tremble
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
do
,
dear
John
!
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
that
he
should
hear
it
from
any
one
but
me
,
and
I
could
not
tell
him
,
unless
we
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
,
my
love
,
"
said
John
,
"
whatever
is
natural
to
you
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
,
and
I
am
sure
it
will
be
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
time
to
say
thus
much
,
and
Ruth
had
hardly
time
to
---
 
just
to
get
a
little
farther
off
---
upon
the
sofa
,
when
Tom
and
Mr
Chuzzlewit
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
came
first
,
and
Tom
was
a
few
seconds
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
Now
Ruth
had
hastily
resolved
that
she
would
beckon
Tom
upstairs
after
a
short
time
,
and
would
tell
him
in
his
little
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
saw
his
dear
old
face
come
in
,
her
heart
was
so
touched
that
she
ran
into
his
arms
,
and
laid
her
head
down
on
his
breast
and
sobbed
out
,
"
Bless
me
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
My
dearest
brother
!
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
looked
up
,
in
surprise
,
and
saw
John
Westlock
close
beside
him
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
John
!
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
John
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Tom
,
"
said
his
friend
,
"
give
me
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
brothers
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
wrung
it
with
all
his
force
,
embraced
his
sister
fervently
,
and
put
her
in
John
Westlock
's
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
to
me
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
is
very
good
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
"
 
<EOS>
Tom
could
find
no
further
utterance
,
but
left
the
room
;
and
Ruth
went
after
him
.
   
<EOS>
And
when
they
came
back
,
which
they
did
by
-
and
-
bye
,
she
looked
more
beautiful
,
and
Tom
more
good
and
true
(
if
that
were
possible
)
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
Tom
could
not
speak
upon
the
subject
even
now
;
being
yet
too
newly
glad
,
he
put
both
his
hands
in
both
of
John
's
with
emphasis
sufficient
for
the
best
speech
ever
spoken
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
chose
to
-
day
,
"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
to
John
;
with
the
same
knowing
smile
as
when
they
had
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
Tom
<EOS>
and
I
lingered
behind
a
discreet
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
so
long
since
I
had
any
practical
knowledge
of
these
subjects
,
that
I
have
been
anxious
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
knowledge
is
still
pretty
accurate
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
,
laughing
,
"
<EOS>
if
it
led
you
to
foresee
what
would
happen
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
am
not
sure
,
Mr
Westlock
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
that
any
great
spirit
of
prophecy
was
needed
,
after
seeing
you
and
Ruth
together
.
<EOS>
Come
hither
,
pretty
one
.
 
<EOS>
See
what
Tom
and
I
purchased
this
morning
,
while
you
were
dealing
in
exchange
with
that
young
merchant
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
's
way
of
seating
her
beside
him
,
and
humouring
his
voice
as
if
she
were
a
child
,
was
whimsical
enough
,
but
full
of
tenderness
,
and
not
ill
adapted
,
somehow
,
to
little
Ruth
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
here
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
taking
a
case
from
his
pocket
,
"
what
a
beautiful
necklace
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
How
it
glitters
!
 
<EOS>
Earrings
,
too
,
and
bracelets
,
and
a
zone
for
your
waist
.
 
<EOS>
This
set
is
yours
,
and
Mary
has
another
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
could
n't
understand
why
I
wanted
two
.
<EOS>
What
a
short
-
sighted
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
Earrings
and
bracelets
,
and
a
zone
for
your
waist
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Beautiful
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
see
how
brave
they
look
.
<EOS>
Ask
Mr
Westlock
to
clasp
them
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
prettiest
thing
to
see
her
holding
out
her
round
,
white
arm
;
and
John
(
oh
deep
,
deep
John
!
)
<EOS>
pretending
that
the
bracelet
was
very
hard
to
fasten
;
it
was
the
prettiest
thing
to
see
her
girding
on
the
precious
little
zone
,
and
yet
obliged
to
have
assistance
because
her
fingers
were
in
such
terrible
perplexity
;
it
was
the
prettiest
thing
to
see
her
so
confused
and
bashful
,
with
the
smiles
and
blushes
playing
brightly
on
her
face
,
like
the
sparkling
light
upon
the
jewels
;
it
was
the
prettiest
thing
that
you
would
see
,
in
the
common
experiences
of
a
twelvemonth
,
rely
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
set
of
jewels
and
the
wearer
are
so
well
matched
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
that
I
do
n't
know
which
becomes
the
other
most
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Westlock
could
tell
me
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
but
I
'll
not
ask
him
,
for
he
is
bribed
.
 
<EOS>
Health
to
wear
them
,
my
dear
,
and
happiness
to
make
you
forgetful
of
them
,
except
as
a
remembrance
from
a
loving
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
patted
her
upon
the
cheek
,
and
said
to
Tom
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
play
the
part
of
a
father
here
,
Tom
,
also
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
not
many
fathers
who
marry
two
such
daughters
on
the
same
day
;
but
we
will
overlook
the
improbability
for
the
gratification
of
an
old
man
's
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
claim
that
much
indulgence
,
"
he
added
,
"
for
I
have
gratified
few
fancies
enough
in
my
life
tending
to
the
happiness
of
others
,
Heaven
knows
!
"
   
<EOS>
These
various
proceedings
had
occupied
so
much
time
,
and
they
fell
into
such
a
pleasant
conversation
now
,
that
it
was
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
time
appointed
for
dinner
before
any
of
them
thought
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
hackney
-
coach
soon
carried
them
to
the
Temple
,
however
;
and
there
they
found
everything
prepared
for
their
reception
,
   
Mr
Tapley
having
been
furnished
with
unlimited
credentials
relative
to
the
ordering
of
dinner
,
had
so
exerted
himself
for
the
honour
of
the
party
,
that
a
prodigious
banquet
was
served
,
under
the
joint
direction
of
himself
and
his
Intended
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
would
have
had
them
of
the
party
,
and
Martin
urgently
seconded
his
wish
,
but
Mark
could
by
no
means
be
persuaded
to
sit
down
at
table
;
observing
,
that
in
having
the
honour
of
attending
to
their
comforts
,
he
felt
himself
,
indeed
,
the
landlord
of
the
Jolly
Tapley
,
and
could
almost
delude
himself
into
the
belief
that
the
entertainment
was
actually
being
held
under
the
Jolly
Tapley
's
roof
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
better
encouragement
of
himself
in
this
fable
,
Mr
Tapley
took
it
upon
him
to
issue
divers
general
directions
to
the
waiters
from
the
hotel
,
relative
to
the
disposal
of
the
dishes
and
so
forth
;
and
as
they
were
usually
in
direct
opposition
to
all
precedent
,
and
were
always
issued
in
his
most
facetious
form
of
thought
and
speech
,
they
occasioned
great
merriment
among
those
attendants
;
in
which
Mr
Tapley
participated
,
with
an
infinite
enjoyment
of
his
own
humour
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
entertained
them
with
short
anecdotes
of
his
travels
appropriate
to
the
occasion
;
and
now
and
then
with
some
comic
passage
or
other
between
himself
and
Mrs
Lupin
;
so
that
explosive
laughs
were
constantly
issuing
from
the
side
-
board
,
and
from
the
backs
of
chairs
;
and
the
head
-
waiter
(
who
wore
powder
,
and
knee
-
smalls
,
and
was
usually
a
grave
man
)
got
to
be
a
bright
scarlet
in
the
face
,
and
broke
his
waistcoat
-
strings
audibly
.
   
<EOS>
Young
Martin
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
Tom
Pinch
at
the
foot
;
and
if
there
were
a
genial
face
at
that
board
,
it
was
Tom
's
.
<EOS>
They
all
took
their
tone
from
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
drank
to
him
,
everybody
looked
to
him
,
everybody
thought
of
him
,
everybody
loved
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
so
much
as
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
somebody
put
out
a
hand
to
shake
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
and
Mary
had
taken
him
aside
before
dinner
,
and
spoken
to
him
so
heartily
of
the
time
to
come
,
laying
such
fervent
stress
upon
the
trust
they
had
in
his
completion
of
their
felicity
,
by
his
society
and
closest
friendship
,
that
Tom
was
positively
moved
to
tears
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
was
full
,
he
said
,
of
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
spoke
the
honest
truth
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
.
 
<EOS>
Large
as
thy
heart
was
,
<EOS>
dear
Tom
Pinch
,
it
had
no
room
that
day
for
anything
but
happiness
and
sympathy
!
   
<EOS>
And
there
was
Fips
,
old
Fips
of
Austin
Friars
,
present
at
the
dinner
,
and
turning
out
to
be
the
jolliest
old
dog
that
ever
did
violence
to
his
convivial
sentiments
by
shutting
himself
up
in
a
dark
office
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
said
Fips
,
when
he
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
pounced
on
Tom
,
and
told
him
that
he
wanted
to
relieve
himself
of
all
his
old
constraint
;
and
in
the
first
place
shook
him
by
one
hand
,
and
in
the
second
place
shook
him
by
the
other
,
and
in
the
third
place
nudged
him
in
the
waistcoat
,
and
in
the
fourth
place
said
,
"
How
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
and
in
a
great
many
other
places
did
a
great
many
other
things
to
show
his
friendliness
and
joy
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
sang
songs
,
did
Fips
;
and
made
speeches
,
did
Fips
;
and
knocked
off
his
wine
pretty
handsomely
,
did
Fips
;
and
in
short
,
he
showed
himself
a
perfect
Trump
,
did
Fips
,
in
all
respects
.
   
<EOS>
But
ah
!
<EOS>
the
happiness
of
strolling
home
at
night
---
obstinate
little
Ruth
,
she
would
n't
hear
of
riding
!
<EOS>
---
as
they
had
done
on
that
dear
night
,
from
Furnival
's
Inn
!
 
<EOS>
The
happiness
of
being
able
to
talk
about
it
,
and
to
confide
their
happiness
to
each
other
!
 
<EOS>
The
happiness
of
stating
all
their
little
plans
to
Tom
,
and
seeing
his
bright
face
grow
brighter
as
they
spoke
!
   
<EOS>
When
they
reached
home
,
Tom
left
John
and
his
sister
in
the
parlour
,
and
went
upstairs
into
his
own
room
,
under
pretence
of
seeking
a
book
.
 
<EOS>
And
Tom
actually
winked
to
himself
when
he
got
upstairs
;
he
thought
it
such
a
deep
thing
to
have
done
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
like
to
be
by
themselves
,
of
course
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
and
<EOS>
I
came
away
so
naturally
,
that
I
have
no
doubt
they
are
expecting
me
,
every
moment
,
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
capital
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
sat
reading
very
long
,
when
he
heard
a
tap
at
his
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
come
in
?
"
said
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
surely
!
"
<EOS>
Tom
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
leave
us
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
sit
by
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
to
make
you
merry
;
not
melancholy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
cheerful
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Brother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
brother
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
there
is
no
danger
of
my
being
melancholy
<EOS>
,
how
can
I
be
melancholy
,
when
I
know
that
you
and
Ruth
are
so
blest
in
each
other
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
find
my
tongue
tonight
,
John
,
"
he
added
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
never
can
tell
you
what
unutterable
joy
this
day
has
given
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
unjust
to
you
to
speak
of
your
having
chosen
a
portionless
girl
,
for
I
feel
that
you
know
her
worth
;
I
am
sure
you
know
her
worth
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
will
it
diminish
in
your
estimation
,
<EOS>
John
,
which
money
might
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
money
would
,
Tom
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
worth
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
who
could
see
her
here
,
and
not
love
her
!
 
<EOS>
Who
could
know
her
,
Tom
,
and
not
honour
her
!
 
<EOS>
Who
could
ever
stand
possessed
of
such
a
heart
as
hers
,
and
grow
indifferent
to
the
treasure
!
 
<EOS>
Who
could
feel
the
rapture
that
I
feel
to
-
day
,
and
love
as
I
love
her
,
Tom
,
without
knowing
something
of
her
worth
!
 
<EOS>
Your
joy
unutterable
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
mine
,
it
's
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
John
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
mine
,
it
's
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
Their
friendly
contention
was
brought
to
a
close
by
little
Ruth
herself
,
who
came
peeping
in
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
And
<EOS>
oh
,
the
look
,
the
glorious
,
half
-
proud
,
half
-
timid
look
<EOS>
she
gave
Tom
,
when
her
lover
drew
her
to
his
side
!
 
<EOS>
As
much
as
to
say
,
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
Tom
,
he
will
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
he
has
a
right
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Because
I
AM
fond
of
him
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
to
Tom
,
he
was
perfectly
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
have
sat
and
looked
at
them
,
just
as
they
were
,
for
hours
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
Tom
,
love
,
as
we
agreed
,
that
we
are
not
going
to
permit
him
to
run
away
,
and
that
we
can
not
possibly
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
loss
of
one
person
,
and
such
a
person
as
Tom
,
too
,
out
of
our
small
household
of
three
,
is
not
to
be
endured
;
and
so
I
have
told
him
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
is
considerate
,
or
whether
he
is
only
selfish
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
need
n't
be
considerate
,
for
he
is
not
the
least
restraint
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
,
dearest
Ruth
?
"
   
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
He
really
did
not
seem
to
be
any
particular
restraint
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
Judging
from
what
ensued
.
   
<EOS>
Was
it
folly
in
Tom
to
be
so
pleased
by
their
remembrance
of
him
at
such
a
time
?
 
<EOS>
Was
their
graceful
love
a
folly
,
were
their
dear
caresses
follies
,
was
their
lengthened
parting
folly
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
folly
in
him
to
watch
her
window
from
the
street
,
and
rate
its
scantiest
gleam
of
light
above
all
diamonds
;
folly
in
her
to
breathe
his
name
upon
her
knees
,
and
pour
out
her
pure
heart
before
that
Being
from
whom
such
hearts
and
such
affections
come
?
   
<EOS>
If
these
be
follies
,
then
Fiery
Face
go
on
and
prosper
!
 
<EOS>
If
they
be
not
,
then
Fiery
Face
avaunt
!
 
<EOS>
But
set
the
crunched
bonnet
at
some
other
single
gentleman
,
in
any
case
,
for
one
is
lost
to
thee
for
ever
!
    
Chapter
54
.
<EOS>
Gives
the
author
great
concern
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
is
the
last
in
the
book
 
<EOS>
Todger
's
was
in
high
feather
,
and
mighty
preparations
for
a
late
breakfast
were
astir
in
its
commercial
bowers
.
 
<EOS>
The
blissful
morning
had
arrived
when
Miss
Pecksniff
was
to
be
united
in
holy
matrimony
,
to
Augustus
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
was
in
a
frame
of
mind
equally
becoming
to
herself
and
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
full
of
clemency
and
conciliation
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
laid
in
several
caldrons
of
live
coals
,
and
was
prepared
to
heap
them
on
the
heads
of
her
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
She
bore
no
spite
nor
malice
in
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Not
the
least
.
   
<EOS>
Quarrels
,
Miss
Pecksniff
said
,
were
dreadful
things
in
families
;
and
though
she
never
could
forgive
her
dear
papa
,
she
was
willing
to
receive
her
other
relations
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
separated
,
she
observed
,
too
long
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
enough
to
call
down
a
judgment
upon
the
family
.
<EOS>
She
believed
the
death
of
Jonas
WAS
a
judgment
on
them
for
their
internal
dissensions
.
 
<EOS>
And
Miss
Pecksniff
was
confirmed
in
this
belief
,
by
the
lightness
with
which
the
visitation
had
fallen
on
herself
.
   
<EOS>
By
way
of
doing
sacrifice
---
not
in
triumph
;
not
,
of
course
,
in
triumph
,
but
in
humiliation
of
spirit
---
this
amiable
young
person
wrote
,
therefore
,
to
her
kinswoman
of
the
strong
mind
,
and
informed
her
that
her
nuptials
would
take
place
on
such
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
had
been
much
hurt
by
the
unnatural
conduct
of
herself
and
daughters
,
and
hoped
they
might
not
have
suffered
in
their
consciences
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
being
desirous
to
forgive
her
enemies
,
and
make
her
peace
with
the
world
before
entering
into
the
most
solemn
of
covenants
with
the
most
devoted
of
men
,
she
now
held
out
the
hand
of
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
That
if
the
strong
-
minded
women
took
that
hand
,
in
the
temper
in
which
it
was
extended
to
her
,
she
,
Miss
Pecksniff
,
did
invite
her
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
of
her
marriage
,
and
did
furthermore
invite
the
three
red
-
nosed
spinsters
,
her
daughters
(
but
Miss
Pecksniff
did
not
particularize
their
noses
)
,
to
attend
as
bridesmaids
.
   
<EOS>
The
strong
-
minded
women
returned
for
answer
,
that
herself
and
daughters
were
,
as
regarded
their
consciences
,
in
the
enjoyment
of
robust
health
,
which
she
knew
Miss
Pecksniff
would
be
glad
to
hear
.
<EOS>
That
she
had
received
Miss
Pecksniff
's
note
with
unalloyed
delight
,
because
she
never
had
attached
the
least
importance
to
the
paltry
and
insignificant
jealousies
with
which
herself
and
circle
had
been
assailed
;
otherwise
than
as
she
had
found
them
,
in
the
contemplation
,
a
harmless
source
of
innocent
mirth
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
would
joyfully
attend
Miss
Pecksniff
's
bridal
;
and
that
her
three
dear
daughters
would
be
happy
to
assist
,
on
so
interesting
,
and
SO
VERY
UNEXPECTED
---
which
the
strong
-
minded
woman
underlined
---
SO
VERY
UNEXPECTED
an
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
receipt
of
this
gracious
reply
,
Miss
Pecksniff
extended
her
forgiveness
and
her
invitations
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Spottletoe
;
to
Mr
George
Chuzzlewit
the
bachelor
cousin
;
to
the
solitary
female
who
usually
had
the
toothache
;
and
to
the
hairy
young
gentleman
with
the
outline
of
a
face
;
surviving
remnants
of
the
party
that
had
once
assembled
in
Mr
Pecksniff
's
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
Miss
Pecksniff
remarked
that
there
was
a
sweetness
in
doing
our
duty
,
which
neutralized
the
bitter
in
our
cups
.
   
<EOS>
The
wedding
guests
had
not
yet
assembled
,
and
indeed
it
was
so
early
that
Miss
Pecksniff
herself
was
in
the
act
of
dressing
at
her
leisure
,
when
a
carriage
stopped
near
the
Monument
;
and
<EOS>
Mark
,
dismounting
from
the
rumble
,
assisted
Mr
Chuzzlewit
to
alight
.
 
<EOS>
The
carriage
remained
in
waiting
;
so
did
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
betook
himself
to
Todger
's
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
shown
,
by
the
degenerate
successor
of
Mr
Bailey
,
into
the
dining
-
parlour
;
where
---
for
his
visit
was
expected
---
Mrs
Todgers
immediately
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
dressed
,
I
see
,
for
the
wedding
,
"
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
,
who
was
greatly
flurried
by
the
preparations
,
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
goes
against
my
wishes
to
have
it
in
progress
just
now
,
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
;
"
but
Miss
Pecksniff
's
mind
was
set
upon
it
,
and
it
really
is
time
that
Miss
Pecksniff
was
married
.
 
<EOS>
That
can
not
be
denied
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
assuredly
not
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
takes
no
part
in
the
proceedings
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
no
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
dropping
her
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Since
she
has
known
the
worst
,
she
has
never
left
my
room
;
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
she
prepared
to
see
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
prepared
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
let
us
lose
no
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
conducted
him
into
the
little
back
chamber
commanding
the
prospect
of
the
cistern
;
and
there
,
sadly
different
from
when
it
had
first
been
her
lodging
,
sat
poor
Merry
,
in
mourning
weeds
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
looked
very
dark
and
sorrowful
;
and
so
did
she
;
but
she
had
one
friend
beside
her
,
faithful
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Chuffey
.
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
Chuzzlewit
sat
down
at
her
side
,
she
took
his
hand
and
put
it
to
her
lips
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
great
grief
.
 
<EOS>
He
too
was
agitated
;
for
he
had
not
seen
her
since
their
parting
in
the
churchyard
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
judged
you
hastily
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
judged
you
cruelly
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
know
that
I
have
your
forgiveness
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
kissed
his
hand
again
;
and
retaining
it
in
hers
,
thanked
him
in
a
broken
voice
,
for
all
his
kindness
to
her
since
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
Pinch
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
has
faithfully
related
to
me
all
that
you
desired
him
to
convey
;
at
a
time
when
he
deemed
it
very
improbable
that
he
would
ever
have
an
opportunity
of
delivering
your
message
.
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
that
if
I
ever
deal
again
with
an
ill
-
advised
and
unawakened
nature
,
hiding
the
strength
it
thinks
its
weakness
,
I
will
have
long
and
merciful
consideration
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
for
me
;
even
for
me
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
quite
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
said
the
words
you
have
repeated
,
when
my
distress
was
very
sharp
and
hard
to
bear
;
I
say
them
now
for
others
;
but
I
can
not
urge
them
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
You
spoke
to
me
after
you
had
seen
and
watched
me
day
by
day
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
great
consideration
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
have
spoken
,
perhaps
,
more
kindly
;
you
might
have
tried
to
invite
my
confidence
by
greater
gentleness
;
but
the
end
would
have
been
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
in
doubt
,
and
not
without
some
inward
self
-
reproach
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
hope
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
your
interposition
would
have
prevailed
with
me
,
when
I
know
how
obdurate
I
was
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
at
all
;
dear
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
I
never
thought
at
all
;
I
had
no
thought
,
no
heart
,
no
care
to
find
one
;
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
grown
out
of
my
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
felt
it
in
my
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
recall
my
trouble
such
as
it
is
and
has
been
---
and
it
is
light
in
comparison
with
trials
which
hundreds
of
good
people
suffer
every
day
,
I
know
---
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
recall
it
to
-
morrow
,
if
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
my
friend
,
for
without
it
no
one
could
have
changed
me
;
nothing
could
have
changed
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
mistrust
me
because
of
these
tears
;
I
can
not
help
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
grateful
for
it
,
in
my
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
am
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
she
is
!
"
said
Mrs
Todgers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
do
I
!
"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
attend
to
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Your
late
husband
's
estate
,
if
not
wasted
by
the
confession
of
a
large
debt
to
the
broken
office
(
which
document
,
being
useless
to
the
runaways
,
has
been
sent
over
to
England
by
them
;
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
creditors
as
for
the
gratification
of
their
dislike
to
him
,
whom
they
suppose
to
be
still
living
)
,
will
be
seized
upon
by
law
;
for
it
is
not
exempt
,
as
I
learn
,
from
the
claims
of
those
who
have
suffered
by
the
fraud
in
which
he
was
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
's
property
was
all
,
or
nearly
all
,
embarked
in
the
same
transaction
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
be
any
left
,
it
will
be
seized
on
,
in
like
manner
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
home
THERE
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
return
to
him
,
"
she
said
,
with
an
instinctive
reference
to
his
having
forced
her
marriage
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
return
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
Mr
Chuzzlewit
resumed
;
"
and
I
am
here
because
I
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
Come
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
From
all
who
are
about
me
,
you
are
certain
<EOS>
(
I
have
ascertained
it
)
of
a
generous
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
But
until
your
health
is
re
-
established
,
and
you
are
sufficiently
composed
to
bear
that
welcome
,
you
shall
have
your
abode
in
any
quiet
retreat
of
your
own
choosing
,
near
London
;
not
so
far
removed
but
that
this
kind
-
hearted
lady
may
still
visit
you
as
often
as
she
pleases
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
suffered
much
;
but
you
are
young
,
and
have
a
brighter
and
a
better
future
stretching
out
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
Come
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Your
sister
is
careless
of
you
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
hurries
on
and
publishes
her
marriage
,
in
a
spirit
which
(
to
say
no
more
of
it
)
is
barely
decent
,
is
unsisterly
,
and
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
the
house
before
her
guests
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
She
means
to
give
you
pain
.
 
<EOS>
Spare
her
the
offence
,
and
come
with
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
,
though
most
unwilling
to
part
with
her
,
added
her
persuasions
.
 
<EOS>
Even
poor
old
Chuffey
(
of
course
included
in
the
project
)
added
his
.
 
<EOS>
She
hurriedly
attired
herself
,
and
was
ready
to
depart
,
when
Miss
Pecksniff
dashed
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
dashed
in
so
suddenly
,
that
she
was
placed
in
an
embarrassing
position
.
 
<EOS>
For
though
she
had
completed
her
bridal
toilette
as
to
her
head
,
on
which
she
wore
a
bridal
bonnet
with
orange
flowers
,
she
had
not
completed
it
as
to
her
skirts
,
which
displayed
no
choicer
decoration
than
a
dimity
bedgown
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
dashed
in
,
in
fact
,
about
half
-
way
through
,
to
console
her
sister
,
in
her
affliction
,
with
a
sight
of
the
aforesaid
bonnet
;
and
being
quite
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
a
visitor
,
until
she
found
Mr
Chuzzlewit
standing
face
to
face
with
her
,
her
surprise
was
an
uncomfortable
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
,
young
lady
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
man
,
eyeing
her
with
strong
disfavour
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
be
married
to
-
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
,
modestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
my
dress
is
rather
---
really
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
delicacy
,
"
said
old
Martin
,
"
is
troubled
,
I
perceive
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
surprised
to
find
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
chosen
the
period
of
your
marriage
unfortunately
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
"
retorted
Cherry
;
very
red
and
angry
in
a
moment
;
"
but
if
you
have
anything
to
say
on
that
subject
,
I
must
beg
to
refer
you
to
Augustus
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
scarcely
think
it
manly
,
I
hope
,
to
force
an
argument
on
me
,
when
Augustus
is
at
all
times
ready
to
discuss
it
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
deceptions
that
may
have
been
practiced
on
my
parent
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
pointedly
;
"
and
as
I
wish
to
be
on
good
terms
with
everybody
at
such
a
time
,
I
should
have
been
glad
if
you
would
have
favoured
us
with
your
company
at
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
ask
you
as
it
is
;
seeing
that
you
have
been
prepossessed
and
set
against
me
in
another
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
my
natural
affections
for
another
quarter
,
and
my
natural
pity
for
another
quarter
;
but
I
can
not
always
submit
to
be
subservient
to
it
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
be
a
little
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
I
have
more
respect
for
myself
,
as
well
as
for
the
man
who
claims
me
as
his
Bride
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
,
meeting
---
as
I
think
;
not
as
she
says
,
for
she
has
said
nothing
about
it
---
with
little
consideration
from
you
,
is
going
away
with
me
,
"
said
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
to
find
that
she
has
some
good
fortune
at
last
,
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
,
tossing
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
congratulate
her
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
surprised
that
this
event
should
be
painful
to
her
---
painful
to
her
---
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
help
that
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Miss
Pecksniff
!
"
said
the
old
man
,
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
a
better
parting
between
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
a
better
parting
on
your
side
,
in
such
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
make
me
your
friend
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
want
a
friend
one
day
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Every
relation
of
life
,
Mr
Chuzzlewit
,
begging
your
pardon
;
and
every
friend
in
life
,
"
returned
Miss
Pecksniff
,
with
dignity
,
"
is
now
bound
up
and
cemented
in
Augustus
.
 
<EOS>
So
long
as
Augustus
is
my
own
,
I
can
not
want
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
speak
of
friends
,
sir
,
I
must
beg
,
once
for
all
,
to
refer
you
to
Augustus
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
my
impression
of
the
religious
ceremony
in
which
I
am
so
soon
to
take
a
part
at
that
altar
to
which
Augustus
will
conduct
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
bear
no
malice
at
any
time
,
much
less
in
a
moment
of
triumph
,
towards
any
one
;
much
less
towards
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
congratulate
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
did
n't
hear
me
say
so
,
I
am
not
to
blame
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
I
owe
it
to
Augustus
,
to
be
punctual
on
an
occasion
when
he
may
naturally
be
supposed
to
be
---
to
be
impatient
---
really
,
Mrs
Todgers
!
<EOS>
---
I
must
beg
your
leave
,
sir
,
to
retire
.
"
    
<EOS>
After
these
words
the
bridal
bonnet
disappeared
;
with
as
much
state
as
the
dimity
bedgown
left
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Martin
gave
his
arm
to
the
younger
sister
without
speaking
;
and
led
her
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Todgers
,
with
her
holiday
garments
fluttering
in
the
wind
,
accompanied
them
to
the
carriage
,
clung
round
Merry
's
neck
at
parting
,
and
ran
back
to
her
own
dingy
house
,
crying
the
whole
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
lean
,
lank
body
,
Mrs
Todgers
,
but
a
well
-
conditioned
soul
within
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
good
Samaritan
was
lean
and
lank
,
and
found
it
hard
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
Who
knows
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
followed
her
so
closely
with
his
eyes
,
that
,
until
she
had
shut
her
own
door
,
they
did
not
encounter
Mr
Tapley
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mark
!
"
he
said
,
as
soon
as
he
observed
it
,
"
what
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
wonderfulest
ewent
,
sir
!
"
returned
Mark
,
pumping
at
his
voice
in
a
most
laborious
manner
,
and
hardly
able
to
articulate
with
all
his
efforts
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
coincidence
as
never
was
equalled
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
blessed
if
here
ai
n't
two
old
neighbours
of
ourn
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
neighbours
?
<EOS>
"
cried
old
Martin
,
looking
out
of
window
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
-
walkin
'
up
and
down
not
five
yards
from
this
spot
,
"
said
Mr
Tapley
,
breathless
,
"
and
they
come
upon
me
like
their

ewent
that
ever
happened

<EOS>
Bring
a

somebody
,
and
knock
me
down
with
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
old
Martin
,
quite
as
much
excited
by
the
spectacle
of
Mark
's
excitement
as
that
strange
person
was
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neighbours
,
where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
sir
!
"
replied
Mr
Tapley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
in
the
city
of
London
!
 
<EOS>
Here
upon
these
very
stones

<EOS>
Here
they
are

<EOS>
Do

'em

<EOS>
Lord
love
their
welcome
faces
<EOS>
,
do
n't
I
know

"
   
<EOS>
With
which
ejaculations
Mr
Tapley
not
only
pointed
to
a
decent
-
looking
man
and
woman
standing
by
,
but
commenced
embracing
them
alternately
,
over
and
over
again
,
in
Monument
Yard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Neighbours
,
WHERE
?
 
<EOS>
old
Martin
shouted
;
almost
maddened
by
his
ineffectual
efforts
to
get
out
at
the
coach
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Neighbours
in
America
!
 
<EOS>
Neighbours
in
Eden
!
"
cried
Mark
.
<EOS>
"
Neighbours
in
the
swamp
,
neighbours
in
the
bush
,
neighbours
in
the
fever
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
she
nurse
us
!
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
he
help
us
!
 
<EOS>
Should
n't
we
both
have
died
without
'em
!
 
<EOS>
Have
n't
they
come
a
-
strugglin
'
back
,
without
a
single
child
for
their
consolation
!
 
<EOS>
And
talk
to
me
of
neighbours
!
"
   
<EOS>
Away
he
went
again
,
in
a
perfectly
wild
state
,
hugging
them
,
and
skipping
round
them
,
and
cutting
in
between
them
,
as
if
he
were
performing
some
frantic
and
outlandish
dance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chuzzlewit
no
sooner
gathered
who
these
people
were
,
than
he
burst
open
the
coach
-
door
somehow
or
other
,
and
came
tumbling
out
among
them
;
and
as
if
the
lunacy
of
Mr
Tapley
were
contagious
,
he
immediately
began
to
shake
hands
too
,
and
exhibit
every
demonstration
of
the
liveliest
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
up
,
behind
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
up
in
the
rumble
.
 
<EOS>
Come
along
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
Go
you
on

Mark

<EOS>
Home

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
"
Home

"
cried
Mr
Tapley
,
seizing
the
old
man
's
hand
in
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
my
opinion
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Home
for
ever

<EOS>
Excuse
the
liberty
<EOS>
,
sir

I

<EOS>
Success
to
the
Jolly
Tapley

<EOS>
There
's
nothin'
in
the
house
they
sha
n't
have
for
the
askin
'
for
,
except
a
bill
.
 
<EOS>
Home
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
"
   
<EOS>
Home
they
rolled
accordingly
,
when
he
had
got
the
old
man
in
again
,
as
fast
as
they
could
go
;
Mark
abating
nothing
of
his
fervour
by
the
way
,
by
allowing
it
to
vent
itself
as
unrestrainedly
as
if
he
had
been
on
Salisbury
Plain
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
the
wedding
party
began
to
assemble
at
Todgers
's
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jinkins
,
the
only
boarder
invited
,
was
on
the
ground
first
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
a
white
favour
in
his
button
-
hole
,
and
a
bran
new
extra
super
double
-
milled
blue
saxony
dress
coat
(
that
was
its
description
in
the
bill
)
,
with
a
variety
of
tortuous
embellishments
about
the
pockets
,
invented
by
the
artist
to
do
honour
to
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
miserable
Augustus
no
longer
felt
strongly
even
on
the
subject
of
Jinkins
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
n't
strength
of
mind
enough
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
!
"
<EOS>
he
had
said
,
in
answer
to
Miss
Pecksniff
,
when
she
urged
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
ever
been
my
rock
ahead
through
life
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
meet
he
should
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
let
Jinkins
come
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jinkins
had
come
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
,
and
there
he
was
.
<EOS>
For
some
few
minutes
he
had
no
companion
but
the
breakfast
,
which
was
set
forth
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
with
unusual
taste
and
ceremony
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Todgers
soon
joined
him
;
and
the
bachelor
cousin
,
the
hairy
young
gentleman
,
and
Mr
and
Mrs
Spottletoe
,
arrived
in
quick
succession
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spottletoe
honoured
Jinkins
with
an
encouraging
bow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
know
you
,
sir
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
you
joy
!
"
 
<EOS>
Under
the
impression
that
Jinkins
was
the
happy
man
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jinkins
explained
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
merely
doing
the
honours
for
his
friend
Moddle
,
who
had
ceased
to
reside
in
the
house
,
and
had
not
yet
arrived
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
arrived
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Spottletoe
,
in
a
great
heat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
"
said
Mr
Jinkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
!
"
cried
Spottletoe
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
begins
well
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
and
honour
this
young
man
begins
well
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
should
very
much
like
to
know
how
it
is
that
every
one
who
comes
into
contact
with
this
family
is
guilty
of
some
gross
insult
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Death
!
 
<EOS>
Not
arrived
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Not
here
to
receive
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
nephew
with
the
outline
of
a
countenance
,
suggested
that
perhaps
he
had
ordered
a
new
pair
of
boots
,
and
they
had
n't
come
home
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
of
Boots
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Spottletoe
,
with
immense
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
bound
to
come
here
in
his
slippers
then
;
he
is
bound
to
come
here
barefoot
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
offer
such
a
wretched
and
evasive
plea
to
me
on
behalf
of
your
friend
,
as
Boots
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
MY
friend
,
"
said
the
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
fiery
Spottletoe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
do
n't
talk
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
door
was
thrown
open
at
this
juncture
,
and
Miss
Pecksniff
entered
,
tottering
,
and
supported
by
her
three
bridesmaids
.
 
<EOS>
The
strong
-
minded
woman
brought
up
the
rear
;
having
waited
outside
until
now
,
for
the
purpose
of
spoiling
the
effect
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
ma'am
!
"
<EOS>
said
Spottletoe
to
the
strong
-
minded
woman
in
a
tone
of
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
see
Mrs
Spottletoe
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
strong
-
minded
woman
with
an
air
of
great
interest
in
Mrs
Spottletoe
's
health
,
regretted
that
she
was
not
more
easily
seen
.
<EOS>
Nature
erring
,
in
that
lady
's
case
,
upon
the
slim
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Spottletoe
is
at
least
more
easily
seen
than
the
bridegroom
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
that
lady
's
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
unless
he
has
confined
his
attentions
to
any
particular
part
or
branch
of
this
family
,
which
would
be
quite
in
keeping
with
its
usual
proceedings
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
allude
to
me
,
sir
---
"
the
strong
-
minded
woman
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
interposed
Miss
Pecksniff
,
"
do
not
allow
Augustus
,
at
this
awful
moment
of
his
life
and
mine
,
to
be
the
means
of
disturbing
that
harmony
which
it
is
ever
Augustus
's
and
my
wish
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
Augustus
has
not
been
introduced
to
any
of
my
relations
now
present
.
<EOS>
He
preferred
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
I
venture
to
assert
,
"
cried
Mr
Spottletoe
,
"
that
the
man
who
aspires
to
join
this
family
,
and
"
prefers
not
"
to
be
introduced
to
its
members
,
is
an
impertinent
Puppy
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
my
opinion
of
HIM
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
strong
-
minded
woman
remarked
with
great
suavity
,
that
she
was
afraid
he
must
be
.
 
<EOS>
Her
three
daughters
observed
aloud
that
it
was
"
Shameful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
Augustus
,
"
said
Miss
Pecksniff
,
tearfully
,
"
<EOS>
indeed
you
do
not
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
Augustus
is
all
mildness
and
humility
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
till
you
see
Augustus
,
and
I
am
sure
he
will
conciliate
your
affections
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
question
arises
,
"
said
Spottletoe
,
folding
his
arms
:
"
How
long
we
are
to
wait
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
accustomed
to
wait
;
that
's
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
want
to
know
how
long
we
are
expected
to
wait
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Todgers
!
"
said
Charity
,
"
Mr
Jinkins
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
there
must
be
some
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
Augustus
must
have
gone
straight
to
the
Altar
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
such
a
thing
was
possible
,
and
the
church
was
close
at
hand
,
Mr
Jinkins
ran
off
to
see
,
accompanied
by
Mr
George
Chuzzlewit
the
bachelor
cousin
,
who
preferred
anything
to
the
aggravation
of
sitting
near
the
breakfast
,
without
being
able
to
eat
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
came
back
with
no
other
tidings
than
a
familiar
message
from
the
clerk
,
importing
that
if
they
wanted
to
be
married
that
morning
they
had
better
look
sharp
,
as
the
curate
was
n't
going
to
wait
there
all
day
.
   
<EOS>
The
bride
was
now
alarmed
;
seriously
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
Good
Heavens
,
what
could
have
happened
!
 
<EOS>
Augustus
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Augustus
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jinkins
volunteered
to
take
a
cab
,
and
seek
him
at
the
newly
-
furnished
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
strong
-
minded
woman
administered
comfort
to
Miss
Pecksniff
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
specimen
of
what
she
had
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
do
her
good
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
dispel
the
romance
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
red
-
nosed
daughters
also
administered
the
kindest
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
'd
come
,
"
they
said
.
 
<EOS>
The
sketchy
nephew
hinted
that
he
might
have
fallen
off
a
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
The
wrath
of
Mr
Spottletoe
resisted
all
the
entreaties
of
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
spoke
at
once
,
and
Miss
Pecksniff
,
with
clasped
hands
,
sought
consolation
everywhere
and
found
it
nowhere
,
when
Jinkins
,
having
met
the
postman
at
the
door
,
came
back
with
a
letter
,
which
he
put
into
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
opened
it
,
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
,
threw
it
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
fainted
away
.
   
<EOS>
They
picked
it
up
;
and
crowding
round
,
and
looking
over
one
another
's
shoulders
,
read
,
in
the
words
and
dashes
following
,
this
communication

They
thought
as
little
of
Miss
Pecksniff
,
while
they
greedily
perused
this
letter
,
as
if
she
were
the
very
last
person
on
earth
whom
it
concerned
.
 
<EOS>
But
Miss
Pecksniff
really
had
fainted
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
bitterness
of
her
mortification
;
the
bitterness
of
having
summoned
witnesses
,
and
such
witnesses
,
to
behold
it
;
the
bitterness
of
knowing
that
the
strong
-
minded
women
and
the
red
-
nosed
daughters
towered
triumphant
in
this
hour
of
their
anticipated
overthrow
;
was
too
much
to
be
borne
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pecksniff
had
fainted
away
in
earnest
.
   
<EOS>
What
sounds
are
these
that
fall
so
grandly
on
the
ear
!
 
<EOS>
What
darkening
room
is
this
!
   
<EOS>
And
that
mild
figure
seated
at
an
organ
,
who
is
he
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
Tom
,
dear
Tom
,
old
friend
!
   
<EOS>
Thy
head
is
prematurely
grey
,
though
Time
has
passed
thee
and
our
old
association
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
those
sounds
with
which
it
is
thy
wo
nt
to
bear
the
twilight
company
,
the
music
of
thy
heart
speaks
out
---
the
story
of
thy
life
relates
itself
.
   
<EOS>
Thy
life
is
tranquil
,
calm
,
and
happy
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
soft
strain
which
ever
and
again
comes
stealing
back
upon
the
ear
,
the
memory
of
thine
old
love
may
find
a
voice
perhaps
;
but
it
is
a
pleasant
,
softened
,
whispering
memory
,
like
that
in
which
we
sometimes
hold
the
dead
,
and
does
not
pain
or
grieve
thee
,
God
be
thanked
.
   
<EOS>
Touch
the
notes
lightly
,
Tom
,
as
lightly
as
thou
wilt
,
but
never
will
thine
hand
<EOS>
fall
half
so
lightly
on
that
Instrument
as
on
the
head
of
thine
old
tyrant
brought
down
very
,
very
low
;
and
never
will
it
make
as
hollow
a
response
to
any
touch
of
thine
,
as
he
does
always
.
   
<EOS>
For
a
drunken
,
begging
,
squalid
,
letter
-
writing
man
,
called
Pecksniff
,
with
a
shrewish
daughter
,
haunts
thee
,
Tom
;
and
when
he
makes
appeals
to
thee
for
cash
,
reminds
thee
that
he
built
thy
fortunes
better
than
his
own
;
and
when
he
spends
it
,
entertains
the
alehouse
company
with
tales
of
thine
ingratitude
and
his
munificence
towards
thee
once
upon
a
time
;
and
then
he
shows
his
elbows
worn
in
holes
,
and
puts
his
soleless
shoes
up
on
a
bench
,
and
begs
his
auditors
look
there
,
while
thou
art
comfortably
housed
and
clothed
.
 
<EOS>
All
known
to
thee
,
and
yet
all
borne
with
,
Tom
!
   
<EOS>
So
,
with
a
smile
upon
thy
face
,
thou
passest
gently
to
another
measure
---
to
a
quicker
and
more
joyful
one
---
and
little
feet
are
used
to
dance
about
thee
at
the
sound
,
and
bright
young
eyes
to
glance
up
into
thine
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
is
one
slight
creature
,
Tom
---
her
child
;
not
Ruth
's
---
whom
thine
eyes
follow
in
the
romp
and
dance
;
who
,
wondering
sometimes
to
see
thee
look
so
thoughtful
,
runs
to
climb
up
on
thy
knee
,
and
put
her
cheek
to
thine
;
who
loves
thee
,
Tom
,
above
the
rest
,
if
that
can
be
;
and
falling
sick
once
,
chose
thee
for
her
nurse
,
and
never
knew
impatience
,
Tom
,
when
thou
wert
by
her
side
.
   
<EOS>
Thou
glidest
,
now
,
into
a
graver
air
;
an
air
devoted
to
old
friends
and
bygone
times
;
and
in
thy
lingering
touch
upon
the
keys
,
and
the
rich
swelling
of
the
mellow
harmony
,
they
rise
before
thee
.
 
<EOS>
The
spirit
of
that
old
man
dead
,
who
delighted
to
anticipate
thy
wants
,
and
never
ceased
to
honour
thee
,
is
there
,
among
the
rest
;
repeating
,
with
a
face
composed
and
calm
,
the
words
he
said
to
thee
upon
his
bed
,
and
blessing
thee
!
   
<EOS>
And
coming
from
a
garden
,
Tom
,
bestrewn
with
flowers
by
children
's
hands
,
thy
sister
,
little
Ruth
,
as
light
of
foot
and
heart
as
in
old
days
,
sits
down
beside
thee
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
Present
,
and
the
Past
,
with
which
she
is
so
tenderly
entwined
in
all
thy
thoughts
,
thy
strain
soars
onward
to
the
Future
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
resounds
within
thee
and
without
,
the
noble
music
,
rolling
round
ye
both
,
shuts
out
the
grosser
prospect
of
an
earthly
parting
,
and
uplifts
ye
both
to
Heaven
!
