In
the
days
when
the
spinning
-
wheels
hummed
busily
in
the
farmhouses
 
and
even
great
ladies
,
clothed
in
silk
and
thread
-
lace
,
had
their
toy
spinning
-
wheels
of
polished
oak
 
there
might
be
seen
in
districts
far
away
among
the
lanes
,
or
deep
in
the
bosom
of
the
hills
,
certain
pallid
undersized
men
,
who
,
by
the
side
of
the
brawny
country
-
folk
,
looked
like
the
remnants
of
a
disinherited
race
.
 
<EOS>
The
shepherd
's
dog
barked
fiercely
when
one
of
these
alien
-
looking
men
appeared
on
the
upland
,
dark
against
the
early
winter
sunset
;
for
what
dog
likes
a
figure
bent
under
a
heavy
bag
?
 
<EOS>
and
these
pale
men
rarely
stirred
abroad
without
that
mysterious
burden
.
 
<EOS>
The
shepherd
himself
,
though
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
bag
held
nothing
but
flaxen
thread
,
or
else
the
long
rolls
of
strong
linen
spun
from
that
thread
,
was
not
quite
sure
that
this
trade
of
weaving
,
indispensable
though
it
was
,
could
be
carried
on
entirely
without
the
help
of
the
Evil
One
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
far
-
off
time
superstition
clung
easily
round
every
person
or
thing
that
was
at
all
unwonted
,
or
even
intermittent
and
occasional
merely
,
like
the
visits
of
the
pedlar
or
the
knife
-
grinder
.
<EOS>
No
one
knew
where
wandering
men
had
their
homes
or
their
origin
;
and
how
was
a
man
to
be
explained
unless
you
at
least
knew
somebody
who
knew
his
father
and
mother
?
<EOS>
To
the
peasants
of
old
times
,
the
world
outside
their
own
direct
experience
was
a
region
of
vagueness
and
mystery
:
to
their
untravelled
thought
a
state
of
wandering
was
a
conception
as
dim
as
the
winter
life
of
the
swallows
that
came
back
with
the
spring
;
and
even
a
settler
,
if
he
came
from
distant
parts
,
hardly
ever
ceased
to
be
viewed
with
a
remnant
of
distrust
,
which
would
have
prevented
any
surprise
if
a
long
course
of
inoffensive
conduct
on
his
part
had
ended
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
;
especially
if
he
had
any
reputation
for
knowledge
,
or
showed
any
skill
in
handicraft
.
 
<EOS>
All
cleverness
,
whether
in
the
rapid
use
of
that
difficult
instrument
the
tongue
,
or
in
some
other
art
unfamiliar
to
villagers
,
was
in
itself
suspicious
:
honest
folk
,
born
and
bred
in
a
visible
manner
,
were
mostly
not
overwise
or
clever
 
at
least
,
not
beyond
such
a
matter
as
knowing
the
signs
of
the
weather
;
and
the
process
by
which
rapidity
and
dexterity
of
any
kind
were
acquired
was
so
wholly
hidden
,
that
they
partook
of
the
nature
of
conjuring
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
it
came
to
pass
that
those
scattered
linen
-
weavers
 
emigrants
from
the
town
into
the
country
 
were
to
the
last
regarded
as
aliens
by
their
rustic
neighbours
,
and
usually
contracted
the
eccentric
habits
which
belong
to
a
state
of
loneliness
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
early
years
of
this
century
,
such
a
linen
-
weaver
,
named
Silas
Marner
,
worked
at
his
vocation
in
a
stone
cottage
that
stood
among
the
nutty
hedgerows
near
the
village
of
Raveloe
,
and
not
far
from
the
edge
of
a
deserted
stone
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
The
questionable
sound
of
Silas
's
loom
,
<EOS>
so
unlike
the
natural
cheerful
trotting
of
the
winnowing
-
machine
,
or
the
simpler
rhythm
of
the
flail
,
had
a
half
-
fearful
fascination
for
the
Raveloe
boys
,
who
would
often
leave
off
their
nutting
or
birds
'
 
nesting
to
peep
in
at
the
window
of
the
stone
cottage
,
counterbalancing
a
certain
awe
at
the
mysterious
action
of
the
loom
,
by
a
pleasant
sense
of
scornful
superiority
,
drawn
from
the
mockery
of
its
alternating
noises
,
along
with
the
bent
,
tread
-
mill
attitude
of
the
weaver
.
 
<EOS>
But
sometimes
it
happened
that
Marner
,
pausing
to
adjust
an
irregularity
in
his
thread
,
became
aware
of
the
small
scoundrels
,
and
,
though
chary
of
his
time
,
he
liked
their
intrusion
so
ill
that
he
would
descend
from
his
loom
,
and
,
opening
the
door
,
<EOS>
would
fix
on
them
a
gaze
that
was
always
enough
to
make
them
take
to
their
legs
in
terror
.
 
<EOS>
For
how
was
it
possible
to
believe
that
those
large
brown
protuberant
eyes
in
Silas
Marner
's
pale
face
really
saw
nothing
very
distinctly
that
was
not
close
to
them
,
and
not
rather
that
their
dreadful
stare
could
dart
cramp
,
or
rickets
,
or
a
wry
mouth
at
any
boy
who
happened
to
be
in
the
rear
?
 
<EOS>
They
had
,
perhaps
,
heard
their
fathers
and
mothers
hint
that
Silas
Marner
could
cure
folks
'
rheumatism
if
he
had
a
mind
,
and
add
,
still
more
darkly
,
that
if
you
could
only
speak
the
devil
fair
enough
,
he
might
save
you
the
cost
of
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
Such
strange
lingering
echoes
of
the
old
demon
-
worship
might
perhaps
even
now
be
caught
by
the
diligent
listener
among
the
grey
-
haired
peasantry
;
for
the
rude
mind
with
difficulty
associates
the
ideas
of
power
and
benignity
.
 
<EOS>
A
shadowy
conception
of
power
that
by
much
persuasion
can
be
induced
to
refrain
from
inflicting
harm
,
is
the
shape
most
easily
taken
by
the
sense
of
the
Invisible
in
the
minds
of
men
who
have
always
been
pressed
close
by
primitive
wants
,
and
to
whom
a
life
of
hard
toil
has
never
been
illuminated
by
any
enthusiastic
religious
faith
.
 
<EOS>
To
them
pain
and
mishap
<EOS>
present
a
far
wider
range
of
possibilities
than
gladness
and
enjoyment
:
their
imagination
is
almost
barren
of
the
images
that
feed
desire
and
hope
,
but
is
all
overgrown
by
recollections
that
are
a
perpetual
pasture
to
fear
.
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
you
can
fancy
that
you
would
like
to
eat
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
once
said
to
an
old
labouring
man
,
who
was
in
his
last
illness
,
and
who
had
refused
all
the
food
his
wife
had
offered
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
answered
,
"
I
've
never
been
used
to
nothing
but
common
victual
,
and
I
ca
n't
eat
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
Experience
had
bred
no
fancies
in
him
that
could
raise
the
phantasm
of
appetite
.
  
<EOS>
And
Raveloe
was
a
village
where
many
of
the
old
echoes
lingered
,
undrowned
by
new
voices
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
it
was
one
of
those
barren
parishes
lying
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
 
inhabited
by
meagre
sheep
and
thinly
-
scattered
shepherds
:
on
the
contrary
,
it
lay
in
the
rich
central
plain
of
what
we
are
pleased
to
call
Merry
England
,
and
held
farms
which
,
speaking
from
a
spiritual
point
of
view
,
paid
highly
-
desirable
tithes
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
nestled
in
a
snug
well
-
wooded
hollow
,
quite
an
hour
's
journey
on
horseback
from
any
turnpike
,
where
it
was
never
reached
by
the
vibrations
of
the
coach
-
horn
,
or
of
public
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
important
-
looking
village
,
with
a
fine
old
church
and
large
churchyard
in
the
heart
of
it
,
and
two
or
three
large
brick
-
and
-
stone
homesteads
,
with
well
-
walled
orchards
and
ornamental
weathercocks
,
standing
close
upon
the
road
,
and
lifting
more
imposing
fronts
than
the
rectory
,
which
peeped
from
among
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
:
 
a
village
which
showed
at
once
the
summits
of
its
social
life
,
and
told
the
practised
eye
that
there
was
no
great
park
and
manor
-
house
in
the
vicinity
,
but
that
there
were
several
chiefs
in
Raveloe
who
could
farm
badly
quite
at
their
ease
,
drawing
enough
money
from
their
bad
farming
,
in
those
war
times
,
to
live
in
a
rollicking
fashion
,
and
keep
a
jolly
Christmas
,
Whitsun
,
and
Easter
tide
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
fifteen
years
since
Silas
Marner
had
first
come
to
Raveloe
;
he
was
then
simply
a
pallid
young
man
,
with
prominent
short
-
sighted
brown
eyes
,
whose
appearance
would
have
had
nothing
strange
for
people
of
average
culture
and
experience
,
but
for
the
villagers
near
whom
he
had
come
to
settle
it
had
mysterious
peculiarities
which
corresponded
with
the
exceptional
nature
of
his
occupation
,
and
his
advent
from
an
unknown
region
called
"
North'ard
"
.
 
<EOS>
So
had
his
way
of
life
:
 
<EOS>
he
invited
no
comer
to
step
across
his
door
-
sill
,
and
he
never
strolled
into
the
village
to
drink
a
pint
at
the
Rainbow
,
or
to
gossip
at
the
wheelwright
's
:
he
sought
no
man
or
woman
,
save
for
the
purposes
of
his
calling
,
or
in
order
to
supply
himself
with
necessaries
;
and
it
was
soon
clear
to
the
Raveloe
lasses
that
he
would
never
urge
one
of
them
to
accept
him
against
her
<EOS>
will
 
<EOS>
quite
as
if
he
had
heard
them
declare
that
they
would
never
marry
a
dead
man
come
to
life
again
.
 
<EOS>
This
view
of
Marner
's
personality
was
not
without
another
ground
than
his
pale
face
and
unexampled
eyes
;
for
Jem
Rodney
,
the
mole
-
catcher
,
averred
that
one
evening
as
he
was
returning
homeward
,
he
saw
Silas
Marner
leaning
against
a
stile
with
a
heavy
bag
on
his
back
,
instead
of
resting
the
bag
on
the
stile
as
a
man
in
his
senses
would
have
done
;
and
that
,
on
coming
up
to
him
,
he
saw
that
Marner
's
eyes
were
set
like
a
dead
man
's
,
and
he
spoke
to
him
,
and
shook
him
,
and
his
limbs
were
stiff
,
and
his
hands
clutched
the
bag
as
if
they
'd
been
made
of
iron
;
but
just
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
weaver
was
dead
,
he
came
all
right
again
,
like
,
as
you
might
say
,
in
the
winking
of
an
eye
,
and
said
"
Good
-
night
"
,
and
walked
off
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
Jem
swore
he
had
seen
,
more
by
token
that
it
was
the
very
day
he
had
been
mole
-
catching
on
Squire
Cass
's
land
,
down
by
the
old
saw
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
Some
said
Marner
must
have
been
in
a
"
fit
"
,
a
word
which
seemed
to
explain
things
otherwise
incredible
;
but
the
argumentative
Mr.
Macey
,
clerk
of
the
parish
,
shook
his
head
,
and
asked
if
anybody
was
ever
known
to
go
off
in
a
fit
and
not
fall
down
.
 
<EOS>
A
fit
was
a
stroke
,
was
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
stroke
to
partly
take
away
the
use
of
a
man
's
limbs
and
throw
him
on
the
parish
,
if
he
'd
got
no
children
to
look
to
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
<EOS>
;
it
was
no
stroke
that
would
let
a
man
stand
on
his
legs
,
like
a
horse
between
the
shafts
,
and
then
walk
off
as
soon
as
you
can
say
"
Gee
!
"
<EOS>
But
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
a
man
's
soul
being
loose
from
his
body
,
and
going
out
and
in
,
like
a
bird
out
of
its
nest
and
back
;
and
that
was
how
folks
got
over
-
wise
,
for
they
went
to
school
in
this
shell
-
less
state
to
those
who
could
teach
them
more
than
their
neighbours
could
learn
with
their
five
senses
and
the
parson
.
 
<EOS>
And
where
did
Master
Marner
get
his
knowledge
of
herbs
from
 
and
charms
too
,
if
he
liked
to
give
them
away
?
 
<EOS>
Jem
Rodney
's
story
was
no
more
than
what
might
have
been
expected
by
anybody
who
had
seen
how
Marner
had
cured
Sally
Oates
,
and
made
her
sleep
like
a
baby
,
when
her
heart
had
been
beating
enough
to
burst
her
body
,
for
two
months
and
more
,
while
she
had
been
under
the
doctor
's
care
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
cure
more
folks
if
he
would
;
but
he
was
worth
speaking
fair
,
if
it
was
only
to
keep
him
from
doing
you
a
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
partly
to
this
vague
fear
that
Marner
was
indebted
for
protecting
him
from
the
persecution
that
his
singularities
might
have
drawn
upon
him
,
but
still
more
to
the
fact
that
,
the
old
linen
-
weaver
in
the
neighbouring
parish
of
Tarley
being
dead
,
his
handicraft
made
him
a
highly
welcome
settler
to
the
richer
housewives
of
the
district
,
and
even
to
the
more
provident
cottagers
,
who
had
their
little
stock
of
yarn
at
the
year
's
end
.
<EOS>
Their
sense
of
his
usefulness
would
have
counteracted
any
repugnance
or
suspicion
which
was
not
confirmed
by
a
deficiency
in
the
quality
or
the
tale
of
the
cloth
he
wove
for
them
.
<EOS>
And
the
years
had
rolled
on
without
producing
any
change
in
the
impressions
of
the
neighbours
concerning
Marner
,
except
the
change
from
novelty
to
habit
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
fifteen
years
the
Raveloe
men
said
just
the
same
things
about
Silas
Marner
as
at
the
beginning
:
they
did
not
say
them
quite
so
often
,
but
they
believed
them
much
more
strongly
when
they
did
say
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
important
addition
which
the
years
had
brought
:
it
was
,
that
Master
Marner
had
laid
by
a
fine
sight
of
money
somewhere
,
and
that
he
could
buy
up
"
bigger
men
"
than
himself
.
  
<EOS>
But
while
opinion
concerning
him
had
remained
nearly
stationary
,
and
his
daily
habits
had
presented
scarcely
any
visible
change
,
Marner
's
inward
life
had
been
a
history
and
a
metamorphosis
,
as
that
of
every
fervid
nature
must
be
when
it
has
fled
,
or
been
condemned
,
to
solitude
.
<EOS>
His
life
,
before
he
came
to
Raveloe
,
had
been
filled
with
the
movement
,
the
mental
activity
,
and
the
close
fellowship
,
which
,
in
that
day
as
in
this
,
marked
the
life
of
an
artisan
early
incorporated
in
a
narrow
religious
sect
,
where
the
poorest
layman
has
the
chance
of
distinguishing
himself
by
gifts
of
speech
,
and
has
,
at
the
very
least
,
the
weight
of
a
silent
voter
in
the
government
of
his
community
.
<EOS>
Marner
was
highly
thought
of
in
that
little
hidden
world
,
known
to
itself
as
the
church
assembling
in
Lantern
Yard
;
he
was
believed
to
be
a
young
man
of
exemplary
life
and
ardent
faith
;
and
a
peculiar
interest
had
been
centred
in
him
ever
since
he
had
fallen
,
at
a
prayer
-
meeting
,
into
a
mysterious
rigidity
and
suspension
of
consciousness
,
which
,
lasting
for
an
hour
or
more
,
had
been
mistaken
for
death
.
 
<EOS>
To
have
sought
a
medical
explanation
for
this
phenomenon
would
have
been
held
by
Silas
himself
,
as
well
as
by
his
minister
and
fellow
-
members
,
a
wilful
self
-
exclusion
from
the
spiritual
significance
that
might
lie
therein
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
was
evidently
a
brother
selected
for
a
peculiar
discipline
;
and
though
the
effort
to
interpret
this
discipline
was
discouraged
by
the
absence
,
on
his
part
,
of
any
spiritual
vision
during
his
outward
trance
,
yet
it
was
believed
by
himself
and
others
that
its
effect
was
seen
in
an
accession
of
light
and
fervour
.
<EOS>
A
less
truthful
man
than
he
might
have
been
tempted
into
the
subsequent
creation
of
a
vision
in
the
form
of
resurgent
memory
;
a
less
sane
man
might
have
believed
in
such
a
creation
;
but
Silas
was
both
sane
and
honest
,
though
,
as
with
many
honest
and
fervent
men
,
culture
had
not
defined
any
channels
for
his
sense
of
mystery
,
and
so
it
spread
itself
over
the
proper
pathway
of
inquiry
and
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
inherited
from
his
mother
some
acquaintance
with
medicinal
herbs
and
their
preparation
 
a
little
store
of
wisdom
which
she
had
imparted
to
him
as
a
solemn
bequest
 
but
<EOS>
of
late
years
he
had
had
doubts
about
the
lawfulness
of
applying
this
knowledge
,
believing
that
herbs
could
have
no
efficacy
without
prayer
,
and
that
prayer
might
suffice
without
herbs
;
so
that
the
inherited
delight
he
had
in
wandering
in
the
fields
in
search
of
foxglove
and
dandelion
and
coltsfoot
,
began
to
wear
to
him
the
character
of
a
temptation
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
members
of
his
church
there
was
one
young
man
,
a
little
older
than
himself
,
with
whom
he
had
long
lived
in
such
close
friendship
that
it
was
the
custom
of
their
Lantern
Yard
brethren
to
call
them
David
and
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
The
real
name
of
the
friend
was
William
Dane
,
and
he
,
too
,
was
regarded
as
a
shining
instance
of
youthful
piety
,
though
somewhat
given
to
over
-
severity
towards
weaker
brethren
,
and
to
be
so
dazzled
by
his
own
light
as
to
hold
himself
wiser
than
his
teachers
.
 
<EOS>
But
whatever
blemishes
others
might
discern
in
William
,
to
his
friend
's
mind
he
was
faultless
;
for
Marner
had
one
of
those
impressible
self
-
doubting
natures
which
,
at
an
inexperienced
age
,
admire
imperativeness
and
lean
on
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
The
expression
of
trusting
simplicity
in
Marner
's
face
,
heightened
by
that
absence
of
special
observation
,
that
defenceless
,
deer
-
like
gaze
which
belongs
to
large
prominent
eyes
,
was
strongly
contrasted
by
the
self
-
complacent
suppression
of
inward
triumph
that
lurked
in
the
narrow
slanting
eyes
and
compressed
lips
of
William
Dane
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
frequent
topics
of
conversation
between
the
two
friends
was
Assurance
of
salvation
:
<EOS>
Silas
confessed
that
he
could
never
arrive
at
anything
higher
than
hope
mingled
with
fear
,
and
listened
with
longing
wonder
when
William
declared
that
he
had
possessed
unshaken
assurance
ever
since
,
in
the
period
of
his
conversion
,
he
had
dreamed
that
he
saw
the
words
"
calling
and
election
sure
"
standing
by
themselves
on
a
white
page
in
the
open
Bible
.
 
<EOS>
Such
colloquies
have
occupied
many
a
pair
of
pale
-
faced
weavers
,
whose
unnurtured
souls
have
been
like
young
winged
things
,
fluttering
forsaken
in
the
twilight
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
seemed
to
the
unsuspecting
Silas
that
the
friendship
had
suffered
no
chill
even
from
his
formation
of
another
attachment
of
a
closer
kind
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
months
he
had
been
engaged
to
a
young
servant
-
woman
,
waiting
only
for
a
little
increase
to
their
mutual
savings
in
order
to
their
marriage
;
and
it
was
a
great
delight
to
him
that
Sarah
did
not
object
to
William
's
occasional
presence
in
their
Sunday
interviews
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
point
in
their
history
that
Silas
's
cataleptic
fit
occurred
during
the
prayer
-
meeting
;
and
amidst
the
various
queries
and
expressions
of
interest
addressed
to
him
by
his
fellow
-
members
,
William
's
suggestion
alone
jarred
with
the
general
sympathy
towards
a
brother
thus
singled
out
for
special
dealings
.
 
<EOS>
He
observed
that
,
to
him
,
this
trance
looked
more
like
a
visitation
of
Satan
than
a
proof
of
divine
favour
,
and
exhorted
his
friend
to
see
that
he
hid
no
accursed
thing
within
his
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
,
feeling
bound
to
accept
rebuke
and
admonition
as
a
brotherly
office
,
felt
no
resentment
,
but
only
pain
,
at
his
friend
's
doubts
concerning
him
;
and
to
this
was
soon
added
some
anxiety
at
the
perception
that
Sarah
's
manner
towards
him
began
to
exhibit
a
strange
fluctuation
between
an
effort
at
an
increased
manifestation
of
regard
and
involuntary
signs
of
shrinking
and
dislike
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
her
if
she
wished
to
break
off
their
engagement
;
but
she
denied
this
:
their
engagement
was
known
to
the
church
,
and
had
been
recognized
in
the
prayer
-
meetings
;
it
could
not
be
broken
off
without
strict
investigation
,
and
Sarah
could
render
no
reason
that
would
be
sanctioned
by
the
feeling
of
the
community
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
senior
deacon
was
taken
dangerously
ill
,
and
,
being
a
childless
widower
,
he
was
tended
night
and
day
by
some
of
the
younger
brethren
or
sisters
.
<EOS>
Silas
frequently
took
his
turn
in
the
night
-
watching
with
William
,
the
one
relieving
the
other
at
two
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
contrary
to
expectation
,
seemed
to
be
on
the
way
to
recovery
,
when
one
night
Silas
,
sitting
up
by
his
bedside
,
observed
that
his
usual
audible
breathing
had
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
The
candle
was
burning
low
,
and
he
had
to
lift
it
to
see
the
patient
's
face
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
Examination
convinced
him
that
the
deacon
was
dead
 
had
been
dead
some
time
,
for
the
limbs
were
rigid
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
asked
himself
if
he
had
been
asleep
,
and
looked
at
the
clock
:
it
was
already
four
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
that
William
had
not
come
?
 
<EOS>
In
much
anxiety
he
went
to
seek
for
help
,
and
soon
there
were
several
friends
assembled
in
the
house
,
the
minister
among
them
,
while
Silas
went
away
to
his
work
,
wishing
he
could
have
met
William
to
know
the
reason
of
his
non
-
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
six
o'clock
,
as
he
was
thinking
of
going
to
seek
his
friend
,
William
came
,
and
with
him
the
minister
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
to
summon
him
to
Lantern
Yard
,
to
meet
the
church
members
there
;
and
to
his
inquiry
concerning
the
cause
of
the
summons
<EOS>
the
only
reply
was
,
"
You
will
hear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nothing
further
was
said
until
Silas
was
seated
in
the
vestry
,
in
front
of
the
minister
,
with
the
eyes
of
those
who
to
him
represented
God
's
people
fixed
solemnly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Then
the
minister
,
taking
out
a
pocket
-
knife
,
showed
it
to
Silas
,
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
where
he
had
left
that
knife
?
 
<EOS>
Silas
said
,
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
left
it
anywhere
out
of
his
own
pocket
 
<EOS>
but
he
was
trembling
at
this
strange
interrogation
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
then
exhorted
not
to
hide
his
sin
,
but
to
confess
and
repent
.
 
<EOS>
The
knife
had
been
found
in
the
bureau
by
the
departed
deacon
's
bedside
 
found
in
the
place
where
the
little
bag
of
church
money
had
lain
,
which
the
minister
himself
had
seen
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
Some
hand
had
removed
that
bag
;
and
whose
hand
could
it
be
,
if
not
that
of
the
man
to
whom
the
knife
belonged
?
 
<EOS>
For
some
time
Silas
was
mute
with
astonishment
:
then
he
said
,
"
God
will
clear
me
:
I
know
nothing
about
the
knife
being
there
,
or
the
money
being
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Search
me
and
my
dwelling
<EOS>
;
you
will
find
nothing
but
three
pound
five
of
my
own
savings
,
which
William
Dane
knows
I
have
had
these
six
months
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
William
groaned
,
but
the
minister
said
,
"
The
proof
is
heavy
against
you
,
brother
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
The
money
was
taken
in
the
night
last
past
,
and
no
man
was
with
our
departed
brother
<EOS>
but
you
,
for
William
Dane
declares
to
us
that
he
was
hindered
by
sudden
sickness
from
going
to
take
his
place
as
usual
,
and
you
yourself
said
that
he
had
not
come
;
and
,
moreover
,
you
neglected
the
dead
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
slept
,
"
said
Silas
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
added
,
"
<EOS>
Or
I
must
have
had
another
visitation
like
that
which
you
have
all
seen
me
under
,
so
that
the
thief
must
have
come
and
gone
while
I
was
not
in
the
body
,
but
out
of
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
say
again
,
search
me
and
my
dwelling
,
for
I
have
been
nowhere
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
search
was
made
,
and
it
ended
 
in
William
Dane
's
finding
the
well
-
known
bag
,
empty
,
tucked
behind
the
chest
of
drawers
in
Silas
's
chamber
!
 
<EOS>
On
this
William
exhorted
his
friend
to
confess
,
and
not
to
hide
his
sin
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
turned
a
look
of
keen
reproach
on
him
,
and
said
,
"
William
,
for
nine
years
that
we
have
gone
in
and
out
together
,
have
you
ever
known
me
tell
a
lie
?
 
<EOS>
But
God
will
clear
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
said
William
,
"
how
do
I
know
what
you
may
have
done
in
the
secret
chambers
of
your
heart
,
to
give
Satan
an
advantage
over
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
was
still
looking
at
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
deep
flush
came
over
his
face
,
and
he
was
about
to
speak
impetuously
,
when
he
seemed
checked
again
by
some
inward
shock
,
that
sent
the
flush
back
and
made
him
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
last
he
spoke
feebly
,
looking
at
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
now
 
the
knife
was
n't
in
my
pocket
.
"
  
<EOS>
William
said
,
"
I
know
nothing
of
what
you
mean
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
other
persons
present
,
however
,
began
to
inquire
where
Silas
meant
to
say
that
the
knife
was
,
but
he
would
give
no
further
explanation
<EOS>
:
he
only
said
,
"
I
am
sore
stricken
;
I
can
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
God
will
clear
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
their
return
to
the
vestry
there
was
further
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
Any
resort
to
legal
measures
for
ascertaining
the
culprit
was
contrary
to
the
principles
of
the
church
in
Lantern
Yard
,
according
to
which
prosecution
was
forbidden
to
Christians
,
even
had
the
case
held
less
scandal
to
the
community
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
members
were
bound
to
take
other
measures
for
finding
out
the
truth
,
and
they
resolved
on
praying
and
drawing
lots
.
 
<EOS>
This
resolution
can
be
a
ground
of
surprise
only
to
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
that
obscure
religious
life
which
has
gone
on
in
the
alleys
of
our
towns
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
knelt
with
his
brethren
,
relying
on
his
own
innocence
being
certified
by
immediate
divine
interference
,
but
feeling
that
there
was
sorrow
and
mourning
behind
for
him
even
then
 
that
his
trust
in
man
had
been
cruelly
bruised
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
The
lots
declared
that
Silas
Marner
was
guilty
.
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
He
was
solemnly
suspended
from
church
-
membership
,
and
called
upon
to
render
up
the
stolen
money
:
only
on
confession
,
as
the
sign
of
repentance
,
could
he
be
received
once
more
within
the
folds
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
Marner
listened
in
silence
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
everyone
rose
to
depart
,
he
went
towards
William
Dane
and
said
,
in
a
voice
shaken
by
agitation
    
<EOS>
"
The
last
time
I
remember
using
my
knife
,
was
when
I
took
it
out
to
cut
a
strap
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
putting
it
in
my
pocket
again
.
<EOS>
_
You
_
stole
the
money
,
and
you
have
woven
a
plot
to
lay
the
sin
at
my
door
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
may
prosper
,
for
all
that
:
there
is
no
just
God
that
governs
the
earth
righteously
,
but
a
God
of
lies
,
that
bears
witness
against
the
innocent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
general
shudder
at
this
blasphemy
.
  
<EOS>
William
said
meekly
,
"
I
leave
our
brethren
to
judge
whether
this
is
the
voice
of
Satan
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
but
pray
for
you
,
Silas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Marner
went
out
with
that
despair
in
his
soul
 
that
shaken
trust
in
God
and
man
,
which
is
little
short
of
madness
to
a
loving
nature
.
<EOS>
In
the
bitterness
of
his
wounded
spirit
,
he
said
to
himself
,
"
_
<EOS>
She
_
will
cast
me
off
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
reflected
that
,
if
she
did
not
believe
the
testimony
against
him
,
her
whole
faith
must
be
upset
as
his
was
.
<EOS>
To
people
accustomed
to
reason
about
the
forms
in
which
their
religious
feeling
has
incorporated
itself
,
it
is
difficult
to
enter
into
that
simple
,
untaught
state
of
mind
in
which
the
form
and
the
feeling
have
never
been
severed
by
an
act
of
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
apt
to
think
it
inevitable
that
a
man
in
Marner
's
position
should
have
begun
to
question
the
validity
of
an
appeal
to
the
divine
judgment
by
drawing
lots
;
but
to
him
this
would
have
been
an
effort
of
independent
thought
such
as
he
had
never
known
;
and
he
must
have
made
the
effort
at
a
moment
when
all
his
energies
were
turned
into
the
anguish
of
disappointed
faith
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
is
an
angel
who
records
the
sorrows
of
men
as
well
as
their
sins
,
he
knows
how
many
and
deep
are
the
sorrows
<EOS>
that
spring
from
false
ideas
for
which
no
man
is
culpable
.
  
<EOS>
Marner
went
home
,
and
for
a
whole
day
sat
alone
,
stunned
by
despair
,
without
any
impulse
to
go
to
Sarah
and
attempt
to
win
her
belief
in
his
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
day
he
took
refuge
from
benumbing
unbelief
,
by
getting
into
his
loom
and
working
away
as
usual
;
and
before
many
hours
were
past
,
the
minister
and
one
of
the
deacons
came
to
him
with
the
message
from
Sarah
,
that
she
held
her
engagement
to
him
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Silas
received
the
message
mutely
,
and
then
turned
away
from
the
messengers
to
work
at
his
loom
again
.
 
<EOS>
In
little
more
than
a
month
from
that
time
,
Sarah
was
married
to
William
Dane
;
and
not
long
afterwards
it
was
known
to
the
brethren
in
Lantern
Yard
that
Silas
Marner
had
departed
from
the
town
.
    
<EOS>
Even
people
whose
lives
have
been
made
various
by
learning
,
sometimes
find
it
hard
to
keep
a
fast
hold
on
their
habitual
views
of
life
,
on
their
faith
in
the
Invisible
,
nay
,
on
the
sense
that
their
past
joys
and
sorrows
are
a
real
experience
,
when
they
are
suddenly
transported
to
a
new
land
,
where
the
beings
around
them
know
nothing
of
their
history
,
and
share
none
of
their
ideas
 
where
their
mother
earth
shows
another
lap
,
and
human
life
has
other
forms
than
those
on
which
their
souls
have
been
nourished
.
 
<EOS>
Minds
that
have
been
unhinged
from
their
old
faith
and
love
,
have
perhaps
sought
this
Lethean
influence
of
exile
,
in
which
the
past
becomes
dreamy
because
its
symbols
have
all
vanished
,
and
the
present
too
is
dreamy
because
it
is
linked
with
no
memories
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
_
their
_
experience
may
hardly
enable
them
thoroughly
to
imagine
what
was
the
effect
on
a
simple
weaver
like
Silas
Marner
,
when
he
left
his
own
country
and
people
and
came
to
settle
in
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
unlike
his
native
town
,
set
within
sight
of
the
widespread
hillsides
,
than
this
low
,
wooded
region
,
where
he
felt
hidden
even
from
the
heavens
by
the
screening
trees
and
hedgerows
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
here
,
when
he
rose
in
the
deep
morning
quiet
and
looked
out
on
the
dewy
brambles
and
rank
tufted
grass
,
<EOS>
that
seemed
to
have
any
relation
with
that
life
centring
in
Lantern
Yard
,
which
had
once
been
to
him
the
altar
-
place
of
high
dispensations
.
 
<EOS>
The
whitewashed
walls
;
the
little
pews
where
well
-
known
figures
entered
with
a
subdued
rustling
,
and
where
first
one
well
-
known
voice
and
then
another
,
pitched
in
a
peculiar
key
of
petition
,
uttered
phrases
at
once
occult
and
familiar
,
like
the
amulet
worn
on
the
heart
;
the
pulpit
where
the
minister
delivered
unquestioned
doctrine
,
and
swayed
to
and
fro
,
and
handled
the
book
in
a
long
accustomed
manner
;
the
very
pauses
between
the
couplets
of
the
hymn
,
as
it
was
given
out
,
and
the
recurrent
swell
of
voices
in
song
:
these
things
had
been
the
channel
of
divine
influences
to
Marner
 
<EOS>
they
were
the
fostering
home
of
his
religious
emotions
 
<EOS>
they
were
Christianity
and
God
's
kingdom
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
A
weaver
who
finds
hard
words
in
his
hymn
-
book
knows
nothing
of
abstractions
;
as
the
little
child
knows
nothing
of
parental
love
,
but
only
knows
one
face
and
one
lap
towards
which
it
stretches
its
arms
for
refuge
and
nurture
.
  
<EOS>
And
what
could
be
more
unlike
that
Lantern
Yard
world
than
the
world
in
Raveloe
?
 
<EOS>
orchards
looking
lazy
with
neglected
plenty
;
the
large
church
in
the
wide
churchyard
,
which
men
gazed
at
lounging
at
their
own
doors
in
service
-
time
<EOS>
;
the
purple
-
faced
farmers
jogging
along
the
lanes
or
turning
in
at
the
Rainbow
;
homesteads
,
where
men
supped
heavily
and
slept
in
the
light
of
the
evening
hearth
,
and
where
women
seemed
to
be
laying
up
a
stock
of
linen
for
the
life
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
no
lips
in
Raveloe
from
which
a
word
could
fall
that
would
stir
Silas
Marner
's
benumbed
faith
to
a
sense
of
pain
.
<EOS>
In
the
early
ages
of
the
world
,
we
know
,
it
was
believed
that
each
territory
was
inhabited
and
ruled
by
its
own
divinities
,
so
that
a
man
could
cross
the
bordering
heights
and
be
out
of
the
reach
of
his
native
gods
,
whose
presence
was
confined
to
the
streams
and
the
groves
and
the
hills
among
which
he
had
lived
from
his
birth
.
 
<EOS>
And
poor
Silas
was
vaguely
conscious
of
something
not
unlike
the
feeling
of
primitive
men
,
when
they
fled
thus
,
in
fear
or
in
sullenness
,
from
the
face
of
an
unpropitious
deity
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
that
the
Power
he
had
vainly
trusted
in
among
the
streets
and
at
the
prayer
-
meetings
,
was
very
far
away
from
this
land
in
which
he
had
taken
refuge
,
where
men
lived
in
careless
abundance
,
knowing
and
needing
nothing
of
that
trust
,
which
,
for
him
,
had
been
turned
to
bitterness
.
<EOS>
The
little
light
he
possessed
spread
its
beams
so
narrowly
,
that
frustrated
belief
was
a
curtain
broad
enough
to
create
for
him
the
blackness
of
night
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
movement
after
the
shock
had
been
to
work
in
his
loom
;
and
he
went
on
with
this
unremittingly
,
never
asking
himself
why
,
now
he
was
come
to
Raveloe
,
he
worked
far
on
into
the
night
to
finish
the
tale
of
Mrs.
Osgood
's
table
-
linen
sooner
than
she
expected
 
without
contemplating
beforehand
the
money
she
would
put
into
his
hand
for
the
work
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
weave
,
like
the
spider
,
from
pure
impulse
,
without
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
's
work
,
pursued
steadily
,
tends
in
this
way
to
become
an
end
in
itself
,
and
so
to
bridge
over
the
loveless
chasms
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
's
hand
satisfied
itself
with
throwing
the
shuttle
,
and
his
eye
with
seeing
the
little
squares
in
the
cloth
complete
themselves
under
his
effort
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
were
the
calls
of
hunger
;
and
Silas
,
in
his
solitude
,
had
to
provide
his
own
breakfast
,
dinner
,
and
supper
,
to
fetch
his
own
water
from
the
well
,
and
put
his
own
kettle
on
the
fire
;
and
all
these
immediate
promptings
helped
,
along
with
the
weaving
,
to
reduce
his
life
to
the
unquestioning
activity
of
a
spinning
insect
.
 
<EOS>
He
hated
the
thought
of
the
past
;
there
was
nothing
that
called
out
his
love
and
fellowship
toward
the
strangers
he
had
come
amongst
;
and
the
future
was
all
dark
,
for
there
was
no
Unseen
Love
that
cared
for
him
.
<EOS>
Thought
was
arrested
by
utter
bewilderment
,
now
its
old
narrow
pathway
was
closed
,
and
affection
seemed
to
have
died
under
the
bruise
that
had
fallen
on
its
keenest
nerves
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
last
Mrs.
Osgood
's
table
-
linen
was
finished
,
and
Silas
was
paid
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
His
earnings
in
his
native
town
,
where
he
worked
for
a
wholesale
dealer
,
had
been
after
a
lower
rate
;
he
had
been
paid
weekly
,
and
of
his
weekly
earnings
a
large
proportion
had
gone
to
objects
of
piety
and
charity
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
he
had
five
bright
guineas
put
into
his
hand
;
no
man
expected
a
share
of
them
,
and
he
loved
no
man
that
he
should
offer
him
a
share
.
<EOS>
But
what
were
the
guineas
to
him
who
saw
no
vista
beyond
countless
days
of
weaving
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
needless
for
him
to
ask
that
,
for
it
was
pleasant
to
him
to
feel
them
in
his
palm
,
and
look
at
their
bright
faces
,
which
were
all
his
own
:
it
was
another
element
of
life
,
like
the
weaving
and
the
satisfaction
of
hunger
,
subsisting
quite
aloof
from
the
life
of
belief
and
love
from
which
he
had
been
cut
off
.
<EOS>
The
weaver
's
hand
had
known
the
touch
of
hard
-
won
money
even
before
the
palm
had
grown
to
its
full
breadth
;
for
twenty
years
,
mysterious
money
had
stood
to
him
as
the
symbol
of
earthly
good
,
and
the
immediate
object
of
toil
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
seemed
to
love
it
little
in
the
years
when
every
penny
had
its
purpose
for
him
;
for
he
loved
the
_
purpose
_
then
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
when
all
purpose
was
gone
,
that
habit
of
looking
towards
the
money
and
grasping
it
with
a
sense
of
fulfilled
effort
made
a
loam
that
was
deep
enough
for
the
seeds
of
desire
;
and
as
Silas
walked
homeward
across
the
fields
in
the
twilight
,
he
drew
out
the
money
and
thought
it
was
brighter
in
the
gathering
gloom
.
  
<EOS>
About
this
time
an
incident
happened
which
seemed
to
open
a
possibility
of
some
fellowship
with
his
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
,
taking
a
pair
of
shoes
to
be
mended
,
he
saw
the
cobbler
's
wife
seated
by
the
fire
,
suffering
from
the
terrible
symptoms
of
heart
-
disease
and
dropsy
,
which
he
had
witnessed
as
the
precursors
of
his
mother
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
a
rush
of
pity
at
the
mingled
sight
and
remembrance
,
and
,
recalling
the
relief
his
mother
had
found
from
a
simple
preparation
of
foxglove
,
he
promised
Sally
Oates
to
bring
her
something
that
would
ease
her
,
since
the
doctor
did
her
no
good
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
office
of
charity
,
Silas
felt
,
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
to
Raveloe
,
a
sense
of
unity
between
his
past
and
present
life
,
which
might
have
been
the
beginning
of
his
rescue
from
the
insect
-
like
existence
into
which
his
nature
had
shrunk
.
<EOS>
But
Sally
Oates
's
disease
had
raised
her
into
a
personage
of
much
interest
and
importance
among
the
neighbours
,
and
the
fact
of
her
having
found
relief
from
drinking
Silas
Marner
's
"
stuff
"
became
a
matter
of
general
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
When
Doctor
Kimble
gave
physic
,
it
was
natural
that
it
should
have
an
effect
;
but
when
a
weaver
,
who
came
from
nobody
knew
where
,
worked
wonders
with
a
bottle
of
brown
waters
,
the
occult
character
of
the
process
was
evident
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
sort
of
thing
had
not
been
known
since
the
Wise
Woman
at
Tarley
died
;
and
she
had
charms
as
well
as
"
stuff
"
<EOS>
:
everybody
went
to
her
when
their
children
had
fits
.
<EOS>
Silas
Marner
must
be
a
person
of
the
same
sort
,
for
how
did
he
know
what
would
bring
back
Sally
Oates
's
breath
,
if
he
did
n't
know
a
fine
sight
more
than
that
?
 
<EOS>
The
Wise
Woman
had
words
that
she
muttered
to
herself
,
so
that
you
could
n't
hear
what
they
were
,
and
if
she
tied
a
bit
of
red
thread
round
the
child
's
toe
<EOS>
the
while
,
it
would
keep
off
the
water
in
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
women
in
Raveloe
,
at
that
present
time
,
who
had
worn
one
of
the
Wise
Woman
's
little
bags
<EOS>
round
their
necks
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
had
never
had
an
idiot
child
,
as
Ann
Coulter
had
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
Marner
could
very
likely
do
as
much
,
and
more
;
and
now
it
was
all
clear
how
he
should
have
come
from
unknown
parts
,
and
be
so
"
comical
-
looking
"
.
<EOS>
But
Sally
Oates
must
mind
and
not
tell
the
doctor
,
for
he
would
be
sure
to
set
his
face
against
Marner
:
he
was
always
angry
about
the
Wise
Woman
,
and
used
to
threaten
those
who
went
to
her
that
they
should
have
none
of
his
help
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
now
found
himself
and
his
cottage
suddenly
beset
by
mothers
who
wanted
him
to
charm
away
the
whooping
-
cough
,
or
bring
back
the
milk
,
and
by
men
who
wanted
stuff
against
the
rheumatics
or
the
knots
in
the
hands
;
and
,
to
secure
themselves
against
a
refusal
,
the
applicants
brought
silver
in
their
palms
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
might
have
driven
a
profitable
trade
in
charms
as
well
as
in
his
small
list
of
drugs
;
but
money
on
this
condition
was
no
temptation
to
him
:
he
had
never
known
an
impulse
towards
falsity
,
and
he
drove
one
after
another
away
with
growing
irritation
,
for
the
news
of
him
as
a
wise
man
had
spread
even
to
Tarley
,
and
it
was
long
before
people
ceased
to
take
long
walks
for
the
sake
of
asking
his
aid
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
hope
in
his
wisdom
was
at
length
changed
into
dread
,
for
no
one
<EOS>
believed
him
when
he
said
he
knew
no
charms
and
could
work
no
cures
,
and
every
man
and
woman
who
had
an
accident
or
a
new
attack
after
applying
to
him
,
set
the
misfortune
down
to
Master
Marner
's
ill
-
will
and
irritated
glances
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
to
pass
that
his
movement
of
pity
towards
Sally
Oates
,
which
had
given
him
a
transient
sense
of
brotherhood
,
heightened
the
repulsion
between
him
and
his
neighbours
,
and
made
his
isolation
more
complete
.
  
<EOS>
Gradually
the
guineas
,
the
crowns
,
and
the
half
-
crowns
grew
to
a
heap
,
and
Marner
drew
less
and
less
for
his
own
wants
,
trying
to
solve
the
problem
of
keeping
himself
strong
enough
to
work
sixteen
hours
a
-
day
on
as
small
an
outlay
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Have
not
men
,
shut
up
in
solitary
imprisonment
,
found
an
interest
in
marking
the
moments
by
straight
strokes
of
a
certain
length
on
the
wall
,
until
the
growth
of
the
sum
of
straight
strokes
,
arranged
in
triangles
,
has
become
a
mastering
purpose
?
 
<EOS>
Do
we
not
wile
away
moments
of
inanity
or
fatigued
waiting
by
repeating
some
trivial
movement
or
sound
,
until
the
repetition
has
bred
a
want
,
which
is
incipient
habit
?
 
<EOS>
That
will
help
us
to
understand
how
the
love
of
accumulating
money
grows
an
absorbing
passion
in
men
whose
imaginations
,
even
in
the
very
beginning
of
their
hoard
,
showed
them
no
purpose
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
Marner
wanted
the
heaps
of
ten
to
grow
into
a
square
,
and
then
into
a
larger
square
;
and
every
added
guinea
,
while
it
was
itself
a
satisfaction
,
bred
a
new
desire
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
strange
world
,
made
a
hopeless
riddle
to
him
,
he
might
,
if
he
had
had
a
less
intense
nature
,
have
sat
weaving
,
weaving
 
looking
towards
the
end
of
his
pattern
,
or
towards
the
end
of
his
web
,
till
he
forgot
the
riddle
,
and
everything
else
but
his
immediate
sensations
;
but
the
money
had
come
to
mark
off
his
weaving
into
periods
,
and
the
money
not
only
grew
,
but
it
remained
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
think
it
was
conscious
of
him
,
as
his
loom
was
,
and
he
would
on
no
account
have
exchanged
those
coins
,
which
had
become
his
familiars
,
for
other
coins
with
unknown
faces
.
 
<EOS>
He
handled
them
,
he
counted
them
,
till
their
form
and
colour
were
like
the
satisfaction
of
a
thirst
to
him
;
but
it
was
only
in
the
night
,
when
his
work
was
done
,
that
he
drew
them
out
to
enjoy
their
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
taken
up
some
bricks
in
his
floor
underneath
his
loom
,
and
here
he
had
made
a
hole
in
which
he
set
the
iron
pot
that
contained
his
guineas
and
silver
coins
,
covering
the
bricks
with
sand
whenever
he
replaced
them
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
the
idea
of
being
robbed
presented
itself
often
or
strongly
to
his
mind
:
<EOS>
hoarding
was
common
in
country
districts
in
those
days
;
there
were
old
labourers
in
the
parish
of
Raveloe
who
were
known
to
have
their
savings
by
them
,
probably
inside
their
flock
-
beds
;
but
their
rustic
neighbours
,
though
not
all
of
them
as
honest
as
their
ancestors
in
the
days
of
King
Alfred
,
had
not
imaginations
bold
enough
to
lay
a
plan
of
burglary
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
they
have
spent
the
money
in
their
own
village
without
betraying
themselves
?
 
<EOS>
They
would
be
obliged
to
"
run
away
"
 
a
course
as
dark
and
dubious
as
a
balloon
journey
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
year
after
year
,
Silas
Marner
had
lived
in
this
solitude
,
his
guineas
rising
in
the
iron
pot
,
and
his
life
narrowing
and
hardening
itself
more
and
more
into
a
mere
pulsation
of
desire
and
satisfaction
that
had
no
relation
to
any
other
being
.
 
<EOS>
His
life
had
reduced
itself
to
the
functions
of
weaving
and
hoarding
,
without
any
contemplation
of
an
end
towards
which
the
functions
tended
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
sort
of
process
has
perhaps
been
undergone
by
wiser
men
,
when
they
have
been
cut
off
from
faith
and
love
 
only
,
instead
of
a
loom
and
a
heap
of
guineas
,
they
have
had
some
erudite
research
,
some
ingenious
project
,
or
some
well
-
knit
theory
.
 
<EOS>
Strangely
Marner
's
face
and
figure
shrank
and
bent
themselves
into
a
constant
mechanical
relation
to
the
objects
of
his
life
,
so
that
he
produced
the
same
sort
of
impression
as
a
handle
or
a
crooked
tube
,
which
has
no
meaning
standing
apart
.
 
<EOS>
The
prominent
eyes
that
used
to
look
trusting
and
dreamy
,
now
looked
as
if
they
had
been
made
to
see
only
one
kind
of
thing
that
was
very
small
,
like
tiny
grain
,
for
which
they
hunted
everywhere
:
and
he
was
so
withered
and
yellow
,
that
,
though
he
was
not
yet
forty
,
the
children
always
called
him
"
Old
Master
Marner
"
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
even
in
this
stage
of
withering
a
little
incident
happened
,
which
showed
that
the
sap
of
affection
was
not
all
gone
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
his
daily
tasks
to
fetch
his
water
from
a
well
a
couple
of
fields
off
,
and
for
this
purpose
,
ever
since
he
came
to
Raveloe
,
he
had
had
a
brown
earthenware
pot
,
which
he
held
as
his
most
precious
utensil
among
the
very
few
conveniences
he
had
granted
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
his
companion
for
twelve
years
,
always
standing
on
the
same
spot
,
always
lending
its
handle
to
him
in
the
early
morning
,
so
that
its
form
had
an
expression
for
him
of
willing
helpfulness
,
and
the
impress
of
its
handle
on
his
palm
gave
a
satisfaction
mingled
with
that
of
having
the
fresh
clear
water
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
as
he
was
returning
from
the
well
,
he
stumbled
against
the
step
of
the
stile
,
and
his
brown
pot
,
falling
with
force
against
the
stones
that
overarched
the
ditch
below
him
,
was
broken
in
three
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
picked
up
the
pieces
and
carried
them
home
with
grief
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
The
brown
pot
could
never
be
of
use
to
him
any
more
,
but
he
stuck
the
bits
together
and
propped
the
ruin
in
its
old
place
for
a
memorial
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
history
of
Silas
Marner
,
until
the
fifteenth
year
after
he
came
to
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
The
livelong
day
he
sat
in
his
loom
,
his
ear
filled
with
its
monotony
,
his
eyes
bent
close
down
on
the
slow
growth
of
sameness
in
the
brownish
web
,
his
muscles
moving
with
such
even
repetition
that
their
pause
seemed
almost
as
much
a
constraint
as
the
holding
of
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
night
came
his
revelry
:
at
night
he
closed
his
shutters
,
and
made
fast
his
doors
,
and
drew
forth
his
gold
.
<EOS>
Long
ago
the
heap
of
coins
had
become
too
large
for
the
iron
pot
to
hold
them
,
and
he
had
made
for
them
two
thick
leather
bags
,
which
wasted
no
room
in
their
resting
-
place
,
but
lent
themselves
flexibly
to
every
corner
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
guineas
shone
as
they
came
pouring
out
of
the
dark
leather
mouths
!
 
<EOS>
The
silver
bore
no
large
proportion
in
amount
to
the
gold
,
because
the
long
pieces
of
linen
which
formed
his
chief
work
were
always
partly
paid
for
in
gold
,
and
out
of
the
silver
he
supplied
his
own
bodily
wants
,
choosing
always
the
shillings
and
sixpences
to
spend
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
He
loved
the
guineas
best
,
but
he
would
not
change
the
silver
 
the
crowns
and
half
-
crowns
that
were
his
own
earnings
,
begotten
by
his
labour
;
he
loved
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
spread
them
out
in
heaps
and
bathed
his
hands
in
them
;
then
he
counted
them
and
set
them
up
in
regular
piles
,
and
felt
their
rounded
outline
between
his
thumb
and
fingers
,
and
thought
fondly
of
the
guineas
that
were
only
half
-
earned
by
the
work
in
his
loom
,
as
if
they
had
been
unborn
children
 
thought
of
the
guineas
that
were
coming
slowly
through
the
coming
years
,
through
all
his
life
,
which
spread
far
away
before
him
,
the
end
quite
hidden
by
countless
days
of
weaving
.
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
his
thoughts
were
still
with
his
loom
and
his
money
when
he
made
his
journeys
through
the
fields
and
the
lanes
to
fetch
and
carry
home
his
work
,
so
that
his
steps
never
wandered
to
the
hedge
-
banks
and
the
lane
-
side
in
search
of
the
once
familiar
herbs
:
these
too
belonged
to
the
past
,
from
which
his
life
had
shrunk
away
,
like
a
rivulet
that
has
sunk
far
down
from
the
grassy
fringe
of
its
old
breadth
into
a
little
shivering
thread
,
that
cuts
a
groove
for
itself
in
the
barren
sand
.
  
<EOS>
But
about
the
Christmas
of
that
fifteenth
year
,
a
second
great
change
came
over
Marner
's
life
,
and
his
history
became
blent
in
a
singular
manner
with
the
life
of
his
neighbours
.
    
<EOS>
The
greatest
man
in
Raveloe
was
Squire
Cass
,
who
lived
in
the
large
red
house
with
the
handsome
flight
of
stone
steps
in
front
and
the
high
stables
behind
it
,
nearly
opposite
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
only
one
among
several
landed
parishioners
,
but
he
alone
was
honoured
with
the
title
of
Squire
;
for
though
Mr.
Osgood
's
family
was
also
understood
to
be
of
timeless
origin
 
the
Raveloe
imagination
having
never
ventured
back
to
that
fearful
blank
when
there
were
no
Osgoods
 
still
,
he
merely
owned
the
farm
he
occupied
;
whereas
Squire
Cass
had
a
tenant
or
two
,
who
complained
of
the
game
to
him
quite
as
if
he
had
been
a
lord
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
still
that
glorious
war
-
time
which
was
felt
to
be
a
peculiar
favour
of
Providence
towards
the
landed
interest
,
and
the
fall
of
prices
had
not
yet
come
to
carry
the
race
of
small
squires
and
yeomen
down
that
road
to
ruin
for
which
extravagant
habits
and
bad
husbandry
were
plentifully
anointing
their
wheels
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
speaking
now
in
relation
to
Raveloe
and
the
parishes
that
resembled
it
;
for
our
old
-
fashioned
country
life
had
many
different
aspects
,
as
all
life
must
have
when
it
is
spread
over
a
various
surface
,
and
breathed
on
variously
by
multitudinous
currents
,
from
the
winds
of
heaven
to
the
thoughts
of
men
,
which
are
for
ever
moving
and
crossing
each
other
with
incalculable
results
.
 
<EOS>
Raveloe
lay
low
among
the
bushy
trees
and
the
rutted
lanes
,
aloof
from
the
currents
of
industrial
energy
and
Puritan
earnestness
:
the
rich
ate
and
drank
freely
,
accepting
gout
and
apoplexy
as
things
that
ran
mysteriously
in
respectable
families
,
and
the
poor
thought
that
the
rich
were
entirely
in
the
right
of
it
to
lead
a
jolly
life
;
besides
,
their
feasting
caused
a
multiplication
of
orts
,
which
were
the
heirlooms
of
the
poor
.
 
<EOS>
Betty
Jay
scented
the
boiling
of
Squire
Cass
's
hams
,
but
her
longing
was
arrested
by
the
unctuous
liquor
in
which
they
were
boiled
;
and
when
the
seasons
brought
round
the
great
merry
-
makings
,
they
were
regarded
on
all
hands
as
a
fine
thing
for
the
poor
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
Raveloe
feasts
were
like
the
rounds
of
beef
and
the
barrels
of
ale
 
<EOS>
they
were
on
a
large
scale
,
and
lasted
a
good
while
,
especially
in
the
winter
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
After
ladies
had
packed
up
their
best
gowns
and
top
-
knots
in
bandboxes
,
and
had
incurred
the
risk
of
fording
streams
on
pillions
with
the
precious
burden
in
rainy
or
snowy
weather
,
when
there
was
no
knowing
how
high
the
water
would
rise
,
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
they
looked
forward
to
a
brief
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
ground
it
was
always
contrived
in
the
dark
seasons
,
when
there
was
little
work
to
be
done
,
and
the
hours
were
long
,
that
several
neighbours
should
keep
open
house
in
succession
.
<EOS>
So
soon
as
Squire
Cass
's
standing
dishes
diminished
in
plenty
and
freshness
,
his
guests
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
walk
a
little
higher
up
the
village
to
Mr.
Osgood
's
,
at
the
Orchards
,
and
they
found
hams
and
chines
uncut
,
pork
-
pies
with
the
scent
of
the
fire
in
them
,
spun
butter
in
all
its
freshness
 
everything
,
in
fact
,
that
appetites
at
leisure
could
desire
,
in
perhaps
greater
perfection
,
though
not
in
greater
abundance
,
than
at
Squire
Cass
's
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
Squire
's
wife
had
died
long
ago
,
and
the
Red
House
was
without
that
presence
of
the
wife
and
mother
which
is
the
fountain
of
wholesome
love
and
fear
in
parlour
and
kitchen
;
and
this
helped
to
account
not
only
for
there
being
more
profusion
than
finished
excellence
in
the
holiday
provisions
,
but
also
for
the
frequency
with
which
the
proud
Squire
condescended
to
preside
in
the
parlour
of
the
Rainbow
rather
than
under
the
shadow
of
his
own
dark
wainscot
;
perhaps
,
also
,
for
the
fact
that
his
sons
had
turned
out
rather
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Raveloe
was
not
a
place
where
moral
censure
was
severe
,
but
it
was
thought
a
weakness
in
the
Squire
that
he
had
kept
all
his
sons
at
home
in
idleness
;
and
though
some
licence
was
to
be
allowed
to
young
men
whose
fathers
could
afford
it
,
people
shook
their
heads
at
the
courses
of
the
second
son
,
Dunstan
,
commonly
called
Dunsey
Cass
,
whose
taste
for
swopping
and
betting
might
turn
out
to
be
a
sowing
of
something
worse
than
wild
oats
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
neighbours
said
,
it
was
no
matter
what
became
of
Dunsey
 
<EOS>
a
spiteful
jeering
fellow
,
who
seemed
to
enjoy
his
drink
the
more
when
other
people
went
dry
 
always
provided
that
his
doings
did
not
bring
trouble
on
a
family
like
Squire
Cass
's
,
with
a
monument
in
the
church
,
and
tankards
older
than
King
George
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
if
Mr.
Godfrey
,
the
eldest
,
a
fine
open
-
faced
good
-
natured
young
man
who
was
to
come
into
the
land
some
day
,
should
take
to
going
along
the
same
road
with
his
brother
,
as
he
had
seemed
to
do
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
went
on
in
that
way
,
he
would
lose
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
;
for
it
was
well
known
that
she
had
looked
very
shyly
on
him
ever
since
last
Whitsuntide
twelvemonth
,
when
there
was
so
much
talk
about
his
being
away
from
home
days
and
days
together
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
wrong
,
more
than
common
 
<EOS>
that
was
quite
clear
;
for
Mr.
Godfrey
did
n't
look
half
so
fresh
-
coloured
and
open
as
he
used
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
everybody
was
saying
,
What
a
handsome
couple
<EOS>
he
and
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
would
make
!
<EOS>
and
if
she
could
come
to
be
mistress
at
the
Red
House
,
there
would
be
a
fine
change
,
for
the
Lammeters
had
been
brought
up
in
that
way
,
that
they
never
suffered
a
pinch
of
salt
to
be
wasted
,
and
yet
everybody
in
their
household
had
of
the
best
,
according
to
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
would
be
a
saving
to
the
old
Squire
,
if
she
never
brought
a
penny
to
her
fortune
;
for
it
was
to
be
feared
that
,
notwithstanding
his
incomings
,
there
were
more
holes
in
his
pocket
than
the
one
where
he
put
his
own
hand
in
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
Mr.
Godfrey
did
n't
turn
over
a
new
leaf
,
he
might
say
"
Good
-
bye
"
to
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
once
hopeful
Godfrey
who
was
standing
,
with
his
hands
in
his
side
-
pockets
and
his
back
to
the
fire
,
in
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
,
one
late
November
afternoon
in
that
fifteenth
year
of
Silas
Marner
's
life
at
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
The
fading
grey
light
fell
dimly
on
the
walls
decorated
with
guns
,
whips
,
and
foxes
'
brushes
,
on
coats
and
hats
flung
on
the
chairs
,
on
tankards
sending
forth
a
scent
of
flat
ale
,
and
on
a
half
-
choked
fire
,
with
pipes
propped
up
in
the
chimney
-
corners
:
signs
of
a
domestic
life
destitute
of
any
hallowing
charm
,
with
which
the
look
of
gloomy
vexation
on
Godfrey
's
blond
face
was
in
sad
accordance
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
waiting
and
listening
for
some
one
's
approach
,
and
presently
the
sound
of
a
heavy
step
,
with
an
accompanying
whistle
,
was
heard
across
the
large
empty
entrance
-
hall
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
a
thick
-
set
,
heavy
-
looking
young
man
entered
,
with
the
flushed
face
and
the
gratuitously
elated
bearing
which
mark
the
first
stage
of
intoxication
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Dunsey
,
and
at
the
sight
of
him
Godfrey
's
face
parted
with
some
of
its
gloom
to
take
on
the
more
active
expression
of
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
The
handsome
brown
spaniel
that
lay
on
the
hearth
retreated
under
the
chair
in
the
chimney
-
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Master
Godfrey
,
what
do
you
want
with
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Dunsey
,
in
a
mocking
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
my
elders
and
betters
,
you
know
;
I
was
obliged
to
come
when
you
sent
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
this
is
what
I
want
 
and
just
shake
yourself
sober
and
listen
,
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
,
savagely
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
himself
been
drinking
more
than
was
good
for
him
,
trying
to
turn
his
gloom
into
uncalculating
anger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
you
,
I
must
hand
over
that
rent
of
Fowler
's
to
the
Squire
,
or
else
<EOS>
tell
him
I
gave
it
you
;
for
he
's
threatening
to
distrain
for
it
,
and
it
'll
all
be
out
soon
,
whether
I
tell
him
or
not
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
just
now
,
before
he
went
out
,
he
should
send
word
to
Cox
to
distrain
,
if
Fowler
did
n't
come
and
pay
up
his
arrears
this
week
.
 
<EOS>
The
Squire
's
short
o
'
cash
,
and
in
no
humour
to
stand
any
nonsense
;
and
<EOS>
you
know
what
he
threatened
,
if
ever
he
found
you
making
away
with
his
money
again
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
see
and
get
the
money
,
and
pretty
quickly
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Dunsey
,
sneeringly
,
coming
nearer
to
his
brother
and
looking
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
,
now
,
you
get
the
money
yourself
,
and
save
me
the
trouble
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Since
you
was
so
kind
as
to
hand
it
over
to
me
,
you
'll
not
refuse
me
the
kindness
to
pay
it
back
for
me
:
it
was
your
brotherly
love
made
you
do
it
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
bit
his
lips
and
clenched
his
fist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
come
near
me
with
that
look
,
else
I
'll
knock
you
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
you
wo
n't
,
"
said
Dunsey
,
turning
away
on
his
heel
,
however
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
I
'm
such
a
good
-
natured
brother
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
might
get
you
turned
out
of
house
and
home
,
and
cut
off
with
a
shilling
any
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
tell
the
Squire
how
his
handsome
son
was
married
to
that
nice
young
woman
,
Molly
Farren
,
and
was
very
unhappy
because
he
could
n't
live
with
his
drunken
wife
,
and
I
should
slip
into
your
place
as
comfortable
as
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
see
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
do
it
 
<EOS>
I
'm
so
easy
and
good
-
natured
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
take
any
trouble
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
'll
get
the
hundred
pounds
for
me
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
get
the
money
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
,
quivering
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
a
shilling
to
bless
myself
with
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
a
lie
that
you
'd
slip
into
my
place
<EOS>
:
you
'd
get
yourself
turned
out
too
,
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
you
begin
telling
tales
,
I
'll
follow
.
 
<EOS>
Bob
's
my
father
's
favourite
 
<EOS>
you
know
that
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
'd
only
think
himself
well
rid
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
said
Dunsey
,
nodding
his
head
sideways
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
be
very
pleasant
to
me
to
go
in
your
company
 
<EOS>
you
're
such
a
handsome
brother
,
and
we
've
always
been
so
fond
of
quarrelling
with
one
another
,
I
should
n't
know
what
to
do
without
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'd
like
better
for
us
both
to
stay
at
home
together
;
I
know
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
'll
manage
to
get
that
little
sum
o
'
money
,
and
I
'll
bid
you
good
-
bye
,
though
I
'm
sorry
to
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dunstan
was
moving
off
,
but
Godfrey
rushed
after
him
and
seized
him
by
the
arm
,
saying
,
with
an
oath
    
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
I
have
no
money
:
I
can
get
no
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Borrow
of
old
Kimble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
he
wo
n't
lend
me
any
more
,
and
I
sha
n't
ask
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
sell
Wildfire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
's
easy
talking
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
the
money
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
've
only
got
to
ride
him
to
the
hunt
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
There
'll
be
Bryce
and
Keating
there
,
for
sure
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
get
more
bids
than
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
,
and
get
back
home
at
eight
o'clock
,
splashed
up
to
the
chin
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
Mrs.
Osgood
's
birthday
dance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Dunsey
,
turning
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
trying
to
speak
in
a
small
mincing
treble
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
's
sweet
Miss
Nancy
coming
;
and
we
shall
dance
with
her
,
and
promise
never
to
be
naughty
again
,
and
be
taken
into
favour
,
and
 
"
  
"
Hold
your
tongue
about
Miss
Nancy
,
you
fool
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
turning
red
,
"
else
<EOS>
I
'll
throttle
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Dunsey
,
still
in
an
artificial
tone
,
but
taking
a
whip
from
the
table
and
beating
the
butt
-
end
of
it
on
his
palm
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
a
very
good
chance
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
advise
you
to
creep
up
her
sleeve
again
:
<EOS>
it
'
ud
be
saving
time
,
if
Molly
should
happen
to
take
a
drop
too
much
laudanum
some
day
,
and
make
a
widower
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
would
n't
mind
being
a
second
,
if
she
did
n't
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
've
got
a
good
-
natured
brother
,
who
'll
keep
your
secret
well
,
because
you
'll
be
so
very
obliging
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
quivering
,
and
pale
again
,
"
my
patience
is
pretty
near
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'd
a
little
more
sharpness
in
you
,
you
might
know
that
you
may
urge
a
man
a
bit
too
far
,
and
make
one
leap
as
easy
as
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
but
what
it
is
so
now
<EOS>
:
I
may
as
well
tell
the
Squire
everything
myself
 
I
should
get
you
off
my
back
,
if
I
got
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
after
all
,
he
'll
know
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
been
threatening
to
come
herself
and
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
do
n't
flatter
yourself
<EOS>
that
your
secrecy
's
worth
any
price
you
choose
to
ask
.
<EOS>
You
drain
me
of
money
till
I
have
got
nothing
to
pacify
_
her
_
with
,
and
she
'll
do
as
she
threatens
some
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
my
father
everything
myself
,
and
you
may
go
to
the
devil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dunsey
perceived
that
he
had
overshot
his
mark
,
and
that
there
was
a
point
at
which
even
the
hesitating
Godfrey
might
be
driven
into
decision
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
said
,
with
an
air
of
unconcern
    
"
<EOS>
As
you
please
;
but
I
'll
have
a
draught
of
ale
first
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
ringing
the
bell
,
he
threw
himself
across
two
chairs
,
and
began
to
rap
the
window
-
seat
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
stood
,
still
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
uneasily
moving
his
fingers
among
the
contents
of
his
side
-
pockets
,
and
looking
at
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
That
big
muscular
frame
of
his
held
plenty
of
animal
courage
,
but
helped
him
to
no
decision
when
the
dangers
to
be
braved
were
such
as
could
neither
be
knocked
down
nor
throttled
.
 
<EOS>
His
natural
irresolution
and
moral
cowardice
were
exaggerated
by
a
position
in
which
dreaded
consequences
seemed
to
press
equally
on
all
sides
,
and
his
irritation
had
no
sooner
provoked
him
to
defy
Dunstan
and
anticipate
all
possible
betrayals
,
than
the
miseries
he
must
bring
on
himself
by
such
a
step
seemed
more
unendurable
to
him
than
the
present
evil
.
 
<EOS>
The
results
of
confession
were
not
contingent
,
they
were
certain
;
whereas
betrayal
was
not
certain
.
<EOS>
From
the
near
vision
of
that
certainty
he
fell
back
on
suspense
and
vacillation
with
a
sense
of
repose
.
 
<EOS>
The
disinherited
son
of
a
small
squire
,
equally
disinclined
to
dig
and
to
beg
,
was
almost
as
helpless
as
an
uprooted
tree
,
which
,
by
the
favour
of
earth
and
sky
,
has
grown
to
a
handsome
bulk
on
the
spot
where
it
first
shot
upward
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
possible
to
think
of
digging
with
some
cheerfulness
if
Nancy
Lammeter
were
to
be
won
on
those
terms
;
but
,
since
he
must
irrevocably
lose
_
<EOS>
her
_
as
well
as
the
inheritance
,
and
must
break
every
tie
<EOS>
but
the
one
that
degraded
him
and
left
him
without
motive
for
trying
to
recover
his
better
self
,
he
could
imagine
no
future
for
himself
on
the
other
side
of
confession
but
<EOS>
that
of
"
'
listing
for
a
soldier
"
 
the
most
desperate
step
,
short
of
suicide
,
in
the
eyes
of
respectable
families
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
he
would
rather
trust
to
casualties
than
to
his
own
resolve
 
rather
go
on
sitting
at
the
feast
,
and
sipping
the
wine
he
loved
,
though
with
the
sword
hanging
over
him
and
terror
in
his
heart
,
than
rush
away
into
the
cold
darkness
where
there
was
no
pleasure
left
.
 
<EOS>
The
utmost
concession
to
Dunstan
about
the
horse
began
to
seem
easy
,
compared
with
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
threat
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
pride
would
not
let
him
recommence
the
conversation
otherwise
than
by
continuing
the
quarrel
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
was
waiting
for
this
,
and
took
his
ale
in
shorter
draughts
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
like
you
,
<EOS>
"
Godfrey
burst
out
,
in
a
bitter
tone
,
"
to
talk
about
my
selling
Wildfire
in
that
cool
way
 
the
last
thing
I
've
got
to
call
my
own
,
and
the
best
bit
of
horse
-
flesh
<EOS>
I
ever
had
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
'd
got
a
spark
of
pride
in
you
,
you
'd
be
ashamed
to
see
the
stables
emptied
,
and
everybody
sneering
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
my
belief
<EOS>
you
'd
sell
yourself
,
if
it
was
only
for
the
pleasure
of
making
somebody
feel
he
'd
got
a
bad
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
Dunstan
,
very
placably
,
"
you
do
me
justice
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
'm
a
jewel
for
'
ticing
people
into
bargains
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
reason
I
advise
you
to
let
_
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
_
sell
Wildfire
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
ride
him
to
the
hunt
to
-
morrow
for
you
,
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
look
so
handsome
as
you
in
the
saddle
,
but
it
's
the
horse
they
'll
bid
for
,
and
not
the
rider
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
daresay
 
trust
my
horse
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
"
said
Dunstan
,
rapping
the
window
-
seat
again
with
an
air
of
great
unconcern
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
_
<EOS>
you
_
have
got
to
pay
Fowler
's
money
;
it
's
none
of
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
You
received
the
money
from
him
when
you
went
to
Bramcote
,
and
_
you
_
told
the
Squire
it
was
n't
paid
.
<EOS>
I
'd
nothing
to
do
with
that
;
you
chose
to
be
so
obliging
as
to
give
it
me
,
that
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
want
to
pay
the
money
,
let
it
alone
;
it
's
all
one
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
willing
to
accommodate
you
by
undertaking
to
sell
the
horse
,
seeing
it
's
not
convenient
to
you
to
go
so
far
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
was
silent
for
some
moments
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
liked
to
spring
on
Dunstan
,
wrench
the
whip
from
his
hand
,
and
flog
him
to
within
an
inch
of
his
life
;
and
no
bodily
fear
could
have
deterred
him
;
but
he
was
mastered
by
another
sort
of
fear
,
which
was
fed
by
feelings
stronger
even
than
his
resentment
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
spoke
again
,
it
was
in
a
half
-
conciliatory
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
you
mean
no
nonsense
about
the
horse
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
sell
him
all
fair
,
and
hand
over
the
money
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
,
you
know
,
everything
'
ull
go
to
smash
<EOS>
,
for
I
've
got
nothing
else
to
trust
to
.
<EOS>
And
you
'll
have
less
pleasure
in
pulling
the
house
over
my
head
,
when
your
own
skull
's
to
be
broken
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
Dunstan
,
rising
;
"
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
'd
come
round
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
the
fellow
to
bring
old
Bryce
up
to
the
scratch
.
<EOS>
I
'll
get
you
a
hundred
and
twenty
for
him
,
if
I
get
you
a
penny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
'll
perhaps
rain
cats
and
dogs
to
-
morrow
,
as
it
did
yesterday
,
and
then
you
ca
n't
go
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
hardly
knowing
whether
he
wished
for
that
obstacle
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
_
it
_
,
"
said
Dunstan
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
always
lucky
in
my
weather
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
rain
if
you
wanted
to
go
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
hold
trumps
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
I
always
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
got
the
beauty
,
you
see
,
and
I
've
got
the
luck
,
so
you
must
keep
me
by
you
for
your
crooked
sixpence
;
you
'll
_
ne_-ver
get
along
without
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Confound
you
,
hold
your
tongue
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
,
impetuously
.
"
<EOS>
And
take
care
to
keep
sober
to
-
morrow
,
else
you
'll
get
pitched
on
your
head
coming
home
,
and
Wildfire
might
be
the
worse
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Make
your
tender
heart
easy
,
"
said
Dunstan
,
opening
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
You
never
knew
me
see
double
when
I
'd
got
a
bargain
to
make
;
it
'
ud
spoil
the
fun
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
whenever
I
fall
,
I
'm
warranted
to
fall
on
my
legs
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
Dunstan
slammed
the
door
behind
him
,
and
left
Godfrey
to
that
bitter
rumination
on
his
personal
circumstances
which
was
now
unbroken
from
day
to
day
save
by
the
excitement
of
sporting
,
drinking
,
card
-
playing
,
or
the
rarer
and
less
oblivious
pleasure
of
seeing
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
.
 
<EOS>
The
subtle
and
varied
pains
springing
from
the
higher
sensibility
that
accompanies
higher
culture
,
are
perhaps
less
pitiable
than
that
dreary
absence
of
impersonal
enjoyment
and
consolation
which
leaves
ruder
minds
to
the
perpetual
urgent
companionship
of
their
own
griefs
and
discontents
.
 
<EOS>
The
lives
of
those
rural
forefathers
,
whom
we
are
apt
to
think
very
prosaic
figures
 
<EOS>
men
whose
only
work
was
to
ride
round
their
land
,
getting
heavier
and
heavier
in
their
saddles
,
and
who
passed
the
rest
of
their
days
in
the
half
-
listless
gratification
of
senses
dulled
by
monotony
 
had
a
certain
pathos
in
them
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
Calamities
came
to
_
them
_
too
,
and
their
early
errors
carried
hard
consequences
:
perhaps
the
love
of
some
sweet
maiden
,
the
image
of
purity
,
order
,
and
calm
,
had
opened
their
eyes
to
the
vision
of
a
life
in
which
the
days
would
not
seem
too
long
,
even
without
rioting
;
but
the
maiden
was
lost
,
and
the
vision
passed
away
,
and
then
what
was
left
to
them
,
especially
when
they
had
become
too
heavy
for
the
hunt
,
or
for
carrying
a
gun
over
the
furrows
,
but
to
drink
and
get
merry
,
or
to
drink
and
get
angry
,
so
that
they
might
be
independent
of
variety
,
and
say
over
again
with
eager
emphasis
the
things
they
had
said
already
any
time
that
twelvemonth
?
<EOS>
Assuredly
,
among
these
flushed
and
dull
-
eyed
men
there
were
some
whom
 
thanks
to
their
native
human
-
kindness
 
even
riot
could
never
drive
into
brutality
;
men
who
,
when
their
cheeks
were
fresh
,
had
felt
the
keen
point
of
sorrow
or
remorse
,
had
been
pierced
by
the
reeds
they
leaned
on
,
or
had
lightly
put
their
limbs
in
fetters
from
which
no
struggle
could
loose
them
;
and
under
these
sad
circumstances
,
common
to
us
all
,
their
thoughts
could
find
no
resting
-
place
outside
the
ever
-
trodden
round
of
their
own
petty
history
.
  
<EOS>
That
,
at
least
,
was
the
condition
of
Godfrey
Cass
in
this
six
-
and
-
twentieth
year
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
A
movement
of
compunction
,
helped
by
those
small
indefinable
influences
which
every
personal
relation
exerts
on
a
pliant
nature
,
had
urged
him
into
a
secret
marriage
,
which
was
a
blight
on
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
ugly
story
of
low
passion
,
delusion
,
and
waking
from
delusion
,
which
needs
not
to
be
dragged
from
the
privacy
of
Godfrey
's
bitter
memory
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
long
known
that
the
delusion
was
partly
due
to
a
trap
laid
for
him
by
Dunstan
,
who
saw
in
his
brother
's
degrading
marriage
the
means
of
gratifying
at
once
his
jealous
hate
and
his
cupidity
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
Godfrey
could
have
felt
himself
simply
a
victim
,
the
iron
bit
that
destiny
had
put
into
his
mouth
would
have
chafed
him
less
intolerably
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
curses
he
muttered
half
aloud
when
he
was
alone
had
had
no
other
object
than
Dunstan
's
diabolical
cunning
,
he
might
have
shrunk
less
from
the
consequences
of
avowal
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
something
else
to
curse
 
his
own
vicious
folly
,
which
now
seemed
as
mad
and
unaccountable
to
him
as
almost
all
our
follies
and
vices
do
when
their
promptings
have
long
passed
away
.
 
<EOS>
For
four
years
he
had
thought
of
Nancy
Lammeter
,
and
wooed
her
with
tacit
patient
worship
,
as
the
woman
who
made
him
think
of
the
future
with
joy
:
she
would
be
his
wife
,
and
would
make
home
lovely
to
him
,
as
his
father
's
home
had
never
been
;
and
it
would
be
easy
,
when
she
was
always
near
,
to
shake
off
those
foolish
habits
that
were
no
pleasures
,
but
only
a
feverish
way
of
annulling
vacancy
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
's
was
an
essentially
domestic
nature
,
bred
up
in
a
home
where
the
hearth
had
no
smiles
,
and
where
the
daily
habits
were
not
chastised
by
the
presence
of
household
order
.
 
<EOS>
His
easy
disposition
made
him
fall
in
unresistingly
with
the
family
courses
,
but
the
need
of
some
tender
permanent
affection
,
the
longing
for
some
influence
that
would
make
the
good
he
preferred
easy
to
pursue
,
caused
the
neatness
,
purity
,
and
liberal
orderliness
of
the
Lammeter
household
,
sunned
by
the
smile
of
Nancy
,
to
seem
like
those
fresh
bright
hours
of
the
morning
when
temptations
go
to
sleep
and
leave
the
ear
open
to
the
voice
of
the
good
angel
,
inviting
to
industry
,
sobriety
,
and
peace
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
the
hope
of
this
paradise
had
not
been
enough
to
save
him
from
a
course
which
shut
him
out
of
it
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
keeping
fast
hold
of
the
strong
silken
rope
by
which
Nancy
would
have
drawn
him
safe
to
the
green
banks
where
it
was
easy
to
step
firmly
,
he
had
let
himself
be
dragged
back
into
mud
and
slime
,
in
which
it
was
useless
to
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
made
ties
for
himself
which
robbed
him
of
all
wholesome
motive
,
and
were
a
constant
exasperation
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
there
was
one
position
worse
than
the
present
:
it
was
the
position
he
would
be
in
when
the
ugly
secret
was
disclosed
;
and
the
desire
that
continually
triumphed
over
every
other
was
that
of
warding
off
the
evil
day
,
when
he
would
have
to
bear
the
consequences
of
his
father
's
violent
resentment
for
the
wound
inflicted
on
his
family
pride
 
would
have
,
perhaps
,
to
turn
his
back
on
that
hereditary
ease
and
dignity
which
,
after
all
,
was
a
sort
of
reason
for
living
,
and
would
carry
with
him
the
certainty
that
he
was
banished
for
ever
from
the
sight
and
esteem
of
Nancy
Lammeter
.
 
<EOS>
The
longer
the
interval
,
the
more
chance
there
was
of
deliverance
from
some
,
at
least
,
of
the
hateful
consequences
to
which
he
had
sold
himself
;
the
more
opportunities
remained
for
him
to
snatch
the
strange
gratification
of
seeing
Nancy
,
and
gathering
some
faint
indications
of
her
lingering
regard
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
this
gratification
he
was
impelled
,
fitfully
,
every
now
and
then
,
after
having
passed
weeks
in
which
he
had
avoided
her
as
the
far
-
off
bright
-
winged
prize
that
only
made
him
spring
forward
and
find
his
chain
all
the
more
galling
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
those
fits
of
yearning
was
on
him
now
,
and
it
would
have
been
strong
enough
to
have
persuaded
him
to
trust
Wildfire
to
Dunstan
rather
than
disappoint
the
yearning
,
even
if
he
had
not
had
another
reason
for
his
disinclination
towards
the
morrow
's
hunt
.
 
<EOS>
That
other
reason
was
the
fact
that
the
morning
's
meet
was
near
Batherley
,
the
market
-
town
where
the
unhappy
woman
lived
,
whose
image
became
more
odious
to
him
every
day
;
and
to
his
thought
the
whole
vicinage
was
haunted
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
yoke
a
man
creates
for
himself
by
wrong
-
doing
will
breed
hate
in
the
kindliest
nature
;
and
the
good
-
humoured
,
affectionate
-
hearted
Godfrey
Cass
was
fast
becoming
a
bitter
man
,
visited
by
cruel
wishes
,
that
seemed
to
enter
,
and
depart
,
and
enter
again
,
like
demons
who
had
found
in
him
a
ready
-
garnished
home
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
this
evening
to
pass
the
time
?
 
<EOS>
He
might
as
well
go
to
the
Rainbow
,
and
hear
the
talk
about
the
cock
-
fighting
<EOS>
:
everybody
was
there
,
and
what
else
was
there
to
be
done
?
 
<EOS>
Though
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
did
not
care
a
button
for
cock
-
fighting
.
<EOS>
Snuff
,
the
brown
spaniel
,
who
had
placed
herself
in
front
of
him
,
and
had
been
watching
him
for
some
time
,
now
jumped
up
in
impatience
for
the
expected
caress
.
<EOS>
But
Godfrey
thrust
her
away
without
looking
at
her
,
and
left
the
room
,
followed
humbly
by
the
unresenting
Snuff
 
perhaps
because
she
saw
no
other
career
open
to
her
.
    
<EOS>
Dunstan
Cass
,
setting
off
in
the
raw
morning
,
at
the
judiciously
quiet
pace
of
a
man
who
is
obliged
to
ride
to
cover
on
his
hunter
,
had
to
take
his
way
along
the
lane
which
,
at
its
farther
extremity
,
passed
by
the
piece
of
unenclosed
ground
called
the
Stone
-
pit
,
where
stood
the
cottage
,
once
a
stone
-
cutter
's
shed
,
now
for
fifteen
years
inhabited
by
Silas
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
The
spot
looked
very
dreary
at
this
season
,
with
the
moist
trodden
clay
about
it
,
and
the
red
,
muddy
water
high
up
in
the
deserted
quarry
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
Dunstan
's
first
thought
as
he
approached
it
;
the
second
was
,
that
the
old
fool
of
a
weaver
,
whose
loom
he
heard
rattling
already
,
had
a
great
deal
of
money
hidden
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
How
was
it
that
he
,
Dunstan
Cass
,
who
had
often
heard
talk
of
Marner
's
miserliness
,
had
never
thought
of
suggesting
to
Godfrey
that
he
should
frighten
or
persuade
the
old
fellow
into
lending
the
money
on
the
excellent
security
of
the
young
Squire
's
prospects
?
 
<EOS>
The
resource
occurred
to
him
now
as
so
easy
and
agreeable
,
especially
as
Marner
's
hoard
was
likely
to
be
large
enough
to
leave
Godfrey
a
handsome
surplus
beyond
his
immediate
needs
,
and
enable
him
to
accommodate
his
faithful
brother
,
that
he
had
almost
turned
the
horse
's
head
towards
home
again
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
would
be
ready
enough
to
accept
the
suggestion
:
he
would
snatch
eagerly
at
a
plan
that
might
save
him
from
parting
with
Wildfire
.
<EOS>
But
when
Dunstan
's
meditation
reached
this
point
,
the
inclination
to
go
on
grew
strong
and
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
want
to
give
Godfrey
that
pleasure
:
he
preferred
that
Master
Godfrey
should
be
vexed
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Dunstan
enjoyed
the
self
-
important
consciousness
of
having
a
horse
to
sell
,
and
the
opportunity
of
driving
a
bargain
,
swaggering
,
and
possibly
taking
somebody
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
all
the
satisfaction
attendant
on
selling
his
brother
's
horse
,
and
not
the
less
have
the
further
satisfaction
of
setting
Godfrey
to
borrow
Marner
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
rode
on
to
cover
.
  
<EOS>
Bryce
and
Keating
were
there
,
as
Dunstan
was
quite
sure
they
would
be
 
<EOS>
he
was
such
a
lucky
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heyday
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Bryce
,
who
had
long
had
his
eye
on
Wildfire
<EOS>
,
"
you
're
on
your
brother
's
horse
to
-
day
:
how
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
've
swopped
with
him
,
"
said
Dunstan
,
whose
delight
in
lying
,
grandly
independent
of
utility
,
was
not
to
be
diminished
by
the
likelihood
that
his
hearer
would
not
believe
him
 
"
Wildfire
's
mine
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
has
he
swopped
with
you
for
that
big
-
boned
hack
of
yours
?
"
<EOS>
said
Bryce
,
quite
aware
that
he
should
get
another
lie
in
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
there
was
a
little
account
between
us
,
"
said
Dunsey
,
carelessly
,
"
and
Wildfire
made
it
even
.
 
<EOS>
I
accommodated
him
by
taking
the
horse
,
though
it
was
against
my
will
,
for
I
'd
got
an
itch
for
a
mare
o
'
<EOS>
Jortin
's
 
as
rare
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
blood
<EOS>
as
ever
you
threw
your
leg
across
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
keep
Wildfire
,
now
I
've
got
him
,
though
I
'd
a
bid
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
for
him
the
other
day
,
from
a
man
over
at
Flitton
 
<EOS>
he
's
buying
for
Lord
Cromleck
 
a
fellow
with
a
cast
in
his
eye
,
and
a
green
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
mean
to
stick
to
Wildfire
:
I
sha
n't
get
a
better
at
a
fence
in
a
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
The
mare
's
got
more
blood
,
but
she
's
a
bit
too
weak
in
the
hind
-
quarters
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bryce
of
course
divined
that
Dunstan
wanted
to
sell
the
horse
,
and
Dunstan
knew
that
he
divined
it
<EOS>
(
horse
-
dealing
is
only
one
of
many
human
transactions
carried
on
in
this
ingenious
manner
)
;
and
they
both
considered
that
the
bargain
was
in
its
first
stage
,
when
Bryce
replied
ironically
    
"
I
wonder
at
that
now
<EOS>
;
I
wonder
you
mean
to
keep
him
;
for
I
never
heard
of
a
man
who
did
n't
want
to
sell
his
horse
getting
a
bid
of
half
as
much
again
as
the
horse
was
worth
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
lucky
if
you
get
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Keating
rode
up
now
,
and
the
transaction
became
more
complicated
.
<EOS>
It
ended
in
the
purchase
of
the
horse
by
Bryce
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
,
to
be
paid
on
the
delivery
of
Wildfire
,
safe
and
sound
,
at
the
Batherley
stables
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
occur
to
Dunsey
that
it
might
be
wise
for
him
to
give
up
the
day
's
hunting
,
proceed
at
once
to
Batherley
,
and
,
having
waited
for
Bryce
's
return
,
hire
a
horse
to
carry
him
home
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
inclination
for
a
run
,
encouraged
by
confidence
in
his
luck
,
and
by
a
draught
of
brandy
from
his
pocket
-
pistol
at
the
conclusion
of
the
bargain
,
was
not
easy
to
overcome
,
especially
with
a
horse
under
him
that
would
take
the
fences
to
the
admiration
of
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
,
however
,
took
one
fence
too
many
,
and
got
his
horse
pierced
with
a
hedge
-
stake
.
<EOS>
His
own
ill
-
favoured
person
,
which
was
quite
unmarketable
,
escaped
without
injury
;
but
poor
Wildfire
,
unconscious
of
his
price
,
turned
on
his
flank
and
painfully
panted
his
last
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
that
Dunstan
,
a
short
time
before
,
having
had
to
get
down
to
arrange
his
stirrup
,
had
muttered
a
good
many
curses
at
this
interruption
,
which
had
thrown
him
in
the
rear
of
the
hunt
near
the
moment
of
glory
,
and
under
this
exasperation
had
taken
the
fences
more
blindly
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
soon
have
been
up
with
the
hounds
again
,
when
the
fatal
accident
happened
;
and
hence
he
was
between
eager
riders
in
advance
,
not
troubling
themselves
about
what
happened
behind
them
,
and
far
-
off
stragglers
,
who
were
as
likely
as
not
to
pass
quite
aloof
from
the
line
of
road
in
which
Wildfire
had
fallen
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
,
whose
nature
it
was
to
care
more
for
immediate
annoyances
than
for
remote
consequences
,
no
sooner
recovered
his
legs
,
and
saw
that
it
was
all
over
with
Wildfire
,
than
he
felt
a
satisfaction
at
the
absence
of
witnesses
to
a
position
which
no
swaggering
could
make
enviable
.
<EOS>
Reinforcing
himself
,
after
his
shake
,
with
a
little
brandy
and
much
swearing
,
he
walked
as
fast
as
he
could
to
a
coppice
on
his
right
hand
,
through
which
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
make
his
way
to
Batherley
without
danger
of
encountering
any
member
of
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
His
first
intention
was
to
hire
a
horse
there
and
ride
home
forthwith
,
for
to
walk
many
miles
without
a
gun
in
his
hand
,
and
along
an
ordinary
road
,
was
as
much
out
of
the
question
to
him
as
to
other
spirited
young
men
of
his
kind
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
much
mind
about
taking
the
bad
news
to
Godfrey
,
for
he
had
to
offer
him
at
the
same
time
the
resource
of
Marner
's
money
;
and
if
Godfrey
kicked
,
as
he
always
did
,
at
the
notion
of
making
a
fresh
debt
from
which
he
himself
got
the
smallest
share
of
advantage
,
why
,
he
would
n't
kick
long
:
<EOS>
Dunstan
felt
sure
he
could
worry
Godfrey
into
anything
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
Marner
's
money
kept
growing
in
vividness
,
now
the
want
of
it
had
become
immediate
;
the
prospect
of
having
to
make
his
appearance
with
the
muddy
boots
of
a
pedestrian
at
Batherley
,
and
to
encounter
the
grinning
queries
of
stablemen
,
stood
unpleasantly
in
the
way
of
his
impatience
to
be
back
at
Raveloe
and
carry
out
his
felicitous
plan
;
and
a
casual
visitation
of
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
as
he
was
ruminating
,
awakened
his
memory
to
the
fact
that
the
two
or
three
small
coins
his
forefinger
encountered
there
were
of
too
pale
a
colour
to
cover
that
small
debt
,
without
payment
of
which
the
stable
-
keeper
had
declared
he
would
never
do
any
more
business
with
Dunsey
Cass
.
 
<EOS>
After
all
,
according
to
the
direction
in
which
the
run
had
brought
him
,
he
was
not
so
very
much
farther
from
home
than
he
was
from
Batherley
;
but
Dunsey
,
not
being
remarkable
for
clearness
of
head
,
was
only
led
to
this
conclusion
by
the
gradual
perception
that
there
were
other
reasons
for
choosing
the
unprecedented
course
of
walking
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
nearly
four
o'clock
,
and
a
mist
was
gathering
:
<EOS>
the
sooner
he
got
into
the
road
the
better
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
having
crossed
the
road
and
seen
the
finger
-
post
only
a
little
while
before
Wildfire
broke
down
;
so
,
buttoning
his
coat
,
twisting
the
lash
of
his
hunting
-
whip
compactly
round
the
handle
,
and
rapping
the
tops
of
his
boots
with
a
self
-
possessed
air
,
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
not
at
all
taken
by
surprise
,
he
set
off
with
the
sense
that
he
was
undertaking
a
remarkable
feat
of
bodily
exertion
,
which
somehow
and
at
some
time
he
should
be
able
to
dress
up
and
magnify
to
the
admiration
of
a
select
circle
at
the
Rainbow
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
young
gentleman
like
Dunsey
is
reduced
to
so
exceptional
a
mode
of
locomotion
as
walking
,
a
whip
in
his
hand
is
a
desirable
corrective
to
a
too
bewildering
dreamy
sense
of
unwontedness
in
his
position
;
and
Dunstan
,
as
he
went
along
through
the
gathering
mist
,
was
always
rapping
his
whip
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Godfrey
's
whip
,
which
he
had
chosen
to
take
without
leave
because
it
had
a
gold
handle
;
of
course
no
one
could
see
,
when
Dunstan
held
it
,
that
the
name
_
Godfrey
Cass
_
was
cut
in
deep
letters
on
that
gold
<EOS>
handle
 
<EOS>
they
could
only
see
that
it
was
a
very
handsome
whip
.
<EOS>
Dunsey
was
not
without
fear
that
he
might
meet
some
acquaintance
in
whose
eyes
he
would
cut
a
pitiable
figure
,
for
mist
is
no
screen
when
people
get
close
to
each
other
;
but
when
he
at
last
found
himself
in
the
well
-
known
Raveloe
lanes
without
having
met
a
soul
,
he
silently
remarked
that
that
was
part
of
his
usual
good
luck
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
mist
,
helped
by
the
evening
darkness
,
was
more
of
a
screen
than
he
desired
,
for
it
hid
the
ruts
into
which
his
feet
were
liable
to
slip
 
<EOS>
hid
everything
,
so
that
he
had
to
guide
his
steps
by
dragging
his
whip
along
the
low
bushes
in
advance
of
the
hedgerow
.
<EOS>
He
must
soon
,
he
thought
,
be
getting
near
the
opening
at
the
Stone
-
pits
:
he
should
find
it
out
by
the
break
in
the
hedgerow
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
it
out
,
however
,
by
another
circumstance
which
he
had
not
expected
 
namely
,
by
certain
gleams
of
light
,
which
he
presently
guessed
to
proceed
from
Silas
Marner
's
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
That
cottage
and
the
money
hidden
within
it
had
been
in
his
mind
continually
during
his
walk
,
and
he
had
been
imagining
ways
of
cajoling
and
tempting
the
weaver
to
part
with
the
immediate
possession
of
his
money
for
the
sake
of
receiving
interest
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
felt
as
if
there
must
be
a
little
frightening
added
to
the
cajolery
,
for
his
own
arithmetical
convictions
were
not
clear
enough
to
afford
him
any
forcible
demonstration
as
to
the
advantages
of
interest
;
and
as
for
security
,
he
regarded
it
vaguely
as
a
means
of
cheating
a
man
by
making
him
believe
that
he
would
be
paid
.
 
<EOS>
Altogether
,
the
operation
on
the
miser
's
mind
was
a
task
that
Godfrey
would
be
sure
to
hand
over
to
his
more
daring
and
cunning
brother
:
Dunstan
had
made
up
his
mind
to
that
;
and
by
the
time
he
saw
the
light
gleaming
through
the
chinks
of
Marner
's
shutters
,
the
idea
of
a
dialogue
with
the
weaver
had
become
so
familiar
to
him
,
that
it
occurred
to
him
as
quite
a
natural
thing
to
make
the
acquaintance
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
There
might
be
several
conveniences
attending
this
course
:
the
weaver
had
possibly
got
a
lantern
,
and
Dunstan
was
tired
of
feeling
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
still
nearly
three
-
quarters
of
a
mile
from
home
,
and
the
lane
was
becoming
unpleasantly
slippery
,
for
the
mist
was
passing
into
rain
.
<EOS>
He
turned
up
the
bank
,
not
without
some
fear
lest
he
might
miss
the
right
way
,
since
he
was
not
certain
whether
the
light
were
in
front
or
on
the
side
of
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
felt
the
ground
before
him
cautiously
with
his
whip
-
handle
,
and
at
last
arrived
safely
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
knocked
loudly
,
rather
enjoying
the
idea
that
the
old
fellow
would
be
frightened
at
the
sudden
noise
.
 
<EOS>
He
heard
no
movement
in
reply
:
all
was
silence
in
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
Was
the
weaver
gone
to
bed
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
why
had
he
left
a
light
?
 
<EOS>
That
was
a
strange
forgetfulness
in
a
miser
.
<EOS>
Dunstan
knocked
still
more
loudly
,
and
,
without
pausing
for
a
reply
,
pushed
his
fingers
through
the
latch
-
hole
,
intending
to
shake
the
door
and
pull
the
latch
-
string
up
and
down
,
not
doubting
that
the
door
was
fastened
.
<EOS>
But
,
to
his
surprise
,
at
this
double
motion
the
door
opened
,
and
he
found
himself
in
front
of
a
bright
fire
which
lit
up
every
corner
of
the
cottage
 
the
bed
,
the
loom
,
the
three
chairs
,
and
the
table
 
and
showed
him
that
Marner
was
not
there
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
at
that
moment
could
be
much
more
inviting
to
Dunsey
than
the
bright
fire
on
the
brick
hearth
:
he
walked
in
and
seated
himself
by
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
front
of
the
fire
,
too
,
that
would
have
been
inviting
to
a
hungry
man
,
if
it
had
been
in
a
different
stage
of
cooking
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
bit
of
pork
suspended
from
the
kettle
-
hanger
by
a
string
passed
through
a
large
door
-
key
,
in
a
way
known
to
primitive
housekeepers
unpossessed
of
jacks
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
pork
had
been
hung
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
hanger
,
apparently
to
prevent
the
roasting
from
proceeding
too
rapidly
during
the
owner
's
absence
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
staring
simpleton
had
hot
meat
for
his
supper
,
then
?
<EOS>
thought
Dunstan
.
 
<EOS>
People
had
always
said
he
lived
on
mouldy
bread
,
on
purpose
to
check
his
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
But
where
could
he
be
at
this
time
,
and
on
such
an
evening
,
leaving
his
supper
in
this
stage
of
preparation
,
and
his
door
unfastened
?
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
's
own
recent
difficulty
in
making
his
way
suggested
to
him
that
the
weaver
had
perhaps
gone
outside
his
cottage
to
fetch
in
fuel
,
or
for
some
such
brief
purpose
,
and
had
slipped
into
the
Stone
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
an
interesting
idea
to
Dunstan
,
carrying
consequences
of
entire
novelty
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
weaver
was
dead
,
who
had
a
right
to
his
money
?
 
<EOS>
Who
would
know
where
his
money
was
hidden
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Who
would
know
that
anybody
had
come
to
take
it
away
?
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
He
went
no
farther
into
the
subtleties
of
evidence
:
<EOS>
the
pressing
question
,
"
Where
_
is
_
the
money
?
"
 
now
took
such
entire
possession
of
him
as
to
make
him
quite
forget
that
the
weaver
's
death
was
not
a
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
A
dull
mind
,
once
arriving
at
an
inference
that
flatters
a
desire
,
is
rarely
able
to
retain
the
impression
that
the
notion
from
which
the
inference
started
was
purely
problematic
.
 
<EOS>
And
Dunstan
's
mind
was
as
dull
as
the
mind
of
a
possible
felon
usually
is
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
only
three
hiding
-
places
where
he
had
ever
heard
of
cottagers
'
hoards
being
found
:
the
thatch
,
the
bed
,
and
a
hole
in
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Marner
's
cottage
had
no
thatch
;
and
Dunstan
's
first
act
,
after
a
train
of
thought
made
rapid
by
the
stimulus
of
cupidity
,
was
to
go
up
to
the
bed
;
but
while
he
did
so
,
his
eyes
travelled
eagerly
over
the
floor
,
where
the
bricks
,
distinct
in
the
fire
-
light
,
were
discernible
under
the
sprinkling
of
sand
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
everywhere
;
for
there
was
one
spot
,
and
one
only
,
which
was
quite
covered
with
sand
,
and
sand
showing
the
marks
of
fingers
,
which
had
apparently
been
careful
to
spread
it
over
a
given
space
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
near
the
treddles
of
the
loom
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
Dunstan
darted
to
that
spot
,
swept
away
the
sand
with
his
whip
,
and
,
inserting
the
thin
end
of
the
hook
between
the
bricks
,
found
that
they
were
loose
.
 
<EOS>
In
haste
he
lifted
up
two
bricks
,
and
saw
what
he
had
no
doubt
was
the
object
of
his
search
;
for
what
could
there
be
but
money
in
those
two
leathern
bags
?
 
<EOS>
And
,
from
their
weight
,
they
must
be
filled
with
guineas
.
<EOS>
Dunstan
felt
round
the
hole
,
to
be
certain
that
it
held
no
more
;
then
hastily
replaced
the
bricks
,
and
spread
the
sand
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
Hardly
more
than
five
minutes
had
passed
since
he
entered
the
cottage
,
but
it
seemed
to
Dunstan
like
a
long
while
;
and
though
he
was
without
any
distinct
recognition
of
the
possibility
that
Marner
might
be
alive
,
and
might
re
-
enter
the
cottage
at
any
moment
,
he
felt
an
undefinable
dread
laying
hold
on
him
,
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
the
bags
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
would
hasten
out
into
the
darkness
,
and
then
consider
what
he
should
do
with
the
bags
.
 
<EOS>
He
closed
the
door
behind
him
immediately
,
that
he
might
shut
in
the
stream
of
light
:
a
few
steps
would
be
enough
to
carry
him
beyond
betrayal
by
the
gleams
from
the
shutter
-
chinks
and
the
latch
-
hole
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
and
darkness
had
got
thicker
,
and
he
was
glad
of
it
;
though
it
was
awkward
walking
with
both
hands
filled
,
so
that
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
grasp
his
whip
along
with
one
of
the
bags
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
gone
a
yard
or
two
,
he
might
take
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
stepped
forward
into
the
darkness
.
    
<EOS>
When
Dunstan
Cass
turned
his
back
on
the
cottage
,
Silas
Marner
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away
from
it
,
plodding
along
from
the
village
with
a
sack
thrown
round
his
shoulders
as
an
overcoat
,
and
with
a
horn
lantern
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
legs
were
weary
,
but
his
mind
was
at
ease
,
free
from
the
presentiment
of
change
.
 
<EOS>
The
sense
of
security
more
frequently
springs
from
habit
than
from
conviction
,
and
for
this
reason
it
often
subsists
after
such
a
change
in
the
conditions
as
might
have
been
expected
to
suggest
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
The
lapse
of
time
during
which
a
given
event
has
not
happened
,
is
,
in
this
logic
of
habit
,
constantly
alleged
as
a
reason
why
the
event
should
never
happen
,
even
when
the
lapse
of
time
is
precisely
the
added
condition
which
makes
the
event
imminent
.
<EOS>
A
man
will
tell
you
that
he
has
worked
in
a
mine
for
forty
years
unhurt
by
an
accident
as
a
reason
why
he
should
apprehend
no
danger
,
though
the
roof
is
beginning
to
sink
;
and
it
is
often
observable
,
that
the
older
a
man
gets
,
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
him
to
retain
a
believing
conception
of
his
own
death
.
 
<EOS>
This
influence
of
habit
was
necessarily
strong
in
a
man
whose
life
was
so
monotonous
as
Marner
's
 
who
saw
no
new
people
and
heard
of
no
new
events
to
keep
alive
in
him
the
idea
of
the
unexpected
and
the
changeful
;
and
it
explains
simply
enough
,
why
his
mind
could
be
at
ease
,
though
he
had
left
his
house
and
his
treasure
more
defenceless
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
was
thinking
with
double
complacency
of
his
supper
:
first
,
because
it
would
be
hot
and
savoury
;
and
secondly
,
because
it
would
cost
him
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
little
bit
of
pork
was
a
present
from
that
excellent
housewife
,
Miss
Priscilla
Lammeter
,
to
whom
he
had
this
day
carried
home
a
handsome
piece
of
linen
;
and
it
was
only
on
occasion
of
a
present
like
this
,
that
Silas
indulged
himself
with
roast
-
meat
.
 
<EOS>
Supper
was
his
favourite
meal
,
because
it
came
at
his
time
of
revelry
,
when
his
heart
warmed
over
his
gold
;
whenever
he
had
roast
-
meat
,
he
always
chose
to
have
it
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
evening
,
he
had
no
sooner
ingeniously
knotted
his
string
fast
round
his
bit
of
pork
,
twisted
the
string
according
to
rule
over
his
door
-
key
,
passed
it
through
the
handle
,
and
made
it
fast
on
the
hanger
,
than
he
remembered
that
a
piece
of
very
fine
twine
was
indispensable
to
his
"
setting
up
"
a
new
piece
of
work
in
his
loom
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
slipped
his
memory
,
because
,
in
coming
from
Mr.
Lammeter
's
,
he
had
not
had
to
pass
through
the
village
;
but
to
lose
time
by
going
on
errands
in
the
morning
<EOS>
was
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
nasty
fog
to
turn
out
into
,
but
there
were
things
Silas
loved
better
than
his
own
comfort
;
so
,
drawing
his
pork
to
the
extremity
of
the
hanger
,
and
arming
himself
with
his
lantern
and
his
old
sack
,
he
set
out
on
what
,
in
ordinary
weather
,
would
have
been
a
twenty
minutes
'
errand
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
locked
his
door
without
undoing
his
well
-
knotted
string
and
retarding
his
supper
;
it
was
not
worth
his
while
to
make
that
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
What
thief
would
find
his
way
to
the
Stone
-
pits
on
such
a
night
as
this
?
<EOS>
and
why
should
he
come
on
this
particular
night
,
when
he
had
never
come
through
all
the
fifteen
years
before
?
 
<EOS>
These
questions
were
not
distinctly
present
in
Silas
's
mind
;
they
merely
serve
to
represent
the
vaguely
-
felt
foundation
of
his
freedom
from
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
He
reached
his
door
in
much
satisfaction
that
his
errand
was
done
:
he
opened
it
,
and
to
his
short
-
sighted
eyes
everything
remained
as
he
had
left
it
,
except
that
the
fire
sent
out
a
welcome
increase
of
heat
.
 
<EOS>
He
trod
about
the
floor
while
putting
by
his
lantern
and
throwing
aside
his
hat
and
sack
,
so
as
to
merge
the
marks
of
Dunstan
's
feet
on
the
sand
in
the
marks
of
his
own
nailed
boots
.
<EOS>
Then
he
moved
his
pork
nearer
to
the
fire
,
and
sat
down
to
the
agreeable
business
of
tending
the
meat
and
warming
himself
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
Any
one
who
had
looked
at
him
as
the
red
light
shone
upon
his
pale
face
,
strange
straining
eyes
,
and
meagre
form
,
would
perhaps
have
understood
the
mixture
of
contemptuous
pity
,
dread
,
and
suspicion
with
which
he
was
regarded
by
his
neighbours
in
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
few
men
could
be
more
harmless
than
poor
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
truthful
simple
soul
,
not
even
the
growing
greed
and
worship
of
gold
could
beget
any
vice
directly
injurious
to
others
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
of
his
faith
quite
put
out
,
and
his
affections
made
desolate
,
he
had
clung
with
all
the
force
of
his
nature
to
his
work
and
his
money
;
and
like
all
objects
to
which
a
man
devotes
himself
,
they
had
fashioned
him
into
correspondence
with
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
His
loom
,
as
he
wrought
in
it
without
ceasing
,
had
in
its
turn
wrought
on
him
,
and
confirmed
more
and
more
the
monotonous
craving
for
its
monotonous
response
.
 
<EOS>
His
gold
,
as
he
hung
over
it
and
saw
it
grow
,
gathered
his
power
of
loving
together
into
a
hard
isolation
like
its
own
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
warm
he
began
to
think
it
would
be
a
long
while
to
wait
till
after
supper
before
he
drew
out
his
guineas
,
and
it
would
be
pleasant
to
see
them
on
the
table
before
him
as
he
ate
his
unwonted
feast
.
 
<EOS>
For
joy
is
the
best
of
wine
,
and
Silas
's
guineas
were
a
golden
wine
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
He
rose
and
placed
his
candle
unsuspectingly
on
the
floor
near
his
loom
,
swept
away
the
sand
without
noticing
any
change
,
and
removed
the
bricks
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
empty
hole
made
his
heart
leap
violently
,
but
the
belief
that
his
gold
was
gone
could
not
come
at
once
 
only
terror
,
and
the
eager
effort
to
put
an
end
to
the
terror
.
 
<EOS>
He
passed
his
trembling
hand
all
about
the
hole
,
trying
to
think
it
possible
that
his
eyes
had
deceived
him
;
then
he
held
the
candle
in
the
hole
and
examined
it
curiously
,
trembling
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
shook
so
violently
that
he
let
fall
the
candle
,
and
lifted
his
hands
to
his
head
,
trying
to
steady
himself
,
that
he
might
think
.
 
<EOS>
Had
he
put
his
gold
somewhere
else
,
by
a
sudden
resolution
last
night
,
and
then
forgotten
it
?
 
<EOS>
A
man
falling
into
dark
waters
seeks
a
momentary
footing
even
on
sliding
stones
;
and
Silas
,
by
acting
as
if
he
believed
in
false
hopes
,
warded
off
the
moment
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
searched
in
every
corner
,
he
turned
his
bed
over
,
and
shook
it
,
and
kneaded
it
;
he
looked
in
his
brick
oven
where
he
laid
his
sticks
.
 
<EOS>
When
there
was
no
other
place
to
be
searched
,
he
kneeled
down
again
and
felt
once
more
all
round
the
hole
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
untried
refuge
left
for
a
moment
's
shelter
from
the
terrible
truth
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
was
a
sort
of
refuge
which
always
comes
with
the
prostration
of
thought
under
an
overpowering
passion
:
it
was
that
expectation
of
impossibilities
,
that
belief
in
contradictory
images
,
which
is
still
distinct
from
madness
,
because
it
is
capable
of
being
dissipated
by
the
external
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
got
up
from
his
knees
trembling
,
and
looked
round
at
the
table
:
did
n't
the
gold
lie
there
after
all
?
 
<EOS>
The
table
was
bare
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
and
looked
behind
him
 
looked
all
round
his
dwelling
,
seeming
to
strain
his
brown
eyes
after
some
possible
appearance
of
the
bags
where
he
had
already
sought
them
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
see
every
object
in
his
cottage
 
and
his
gold
was
not
there
.
  
<EOS>
Again
he
put
his
trembling
hands
to
his
head
,
and
gave
a
wild
ringing
scream
,
the
cry
of
desolation
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
after
,
he
stood
motionless
;
but
the
cry
had
relieved
him
from
the
first
maddening
pressure
of
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
,
and
tottered
towards
his
loom
,
and
got
into
the
seat
where
he
worked
,
instinctively
seeking
this
as
the
strongest
assurance
of
reality
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
that
all
the
false
hopes
had
vanished
,
and
the
first
shock
of
certainty
was
past
,
the
idea
of
a
thief
began
to
present
itself
,
and
he
entertained
it
eagerly
,
because
a
thief
might
be
caught
and
made
to
restore
the
gold
.
 
<EOS>
The
thought
brought
some
new
strength
with
it
,
and
he
started
from
his
loom
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
opened
it
the
rain
beat
in
upon
him
,
for
it
was
falling
more
and
more
heavily
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
footsteps
to
be
tracked
on
such
a
night
 
footsteps
?
<EOS>
When
had
the
thief
come
?
 
<EOS>
During
Silas
's
absence
in
the
daytime
the
door
had
been
locked
,
and
there
had
been
no
marks
of
any
inroad
on
his
return
by
daylight
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
evening
,
too
,
he
said
to
himself
,
everything
was
the
same
as
when
he
had
left
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
sand
and
bricks
looked
as
if
they
had
not
been
moved
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Was
_
it
a
thief
who
had
taken
the
bags
?
 
<EOS>
or
was
it
a
cruel
power
that
no
hands
could
reach
,
which
had
delighted
in
making
him
a
second
time
desolate
?
 
<EOS>
He
shrank
from
this
vaguer
dread
,
and
fixed
his
mind
with
struggling
effort
on
the
robber
with
hands
,
who
could
be
reached
by
hands
.
 
<EOS>
His
thoughts
glanced
at
all
the
neighbours
who
had
made
any
remarks
,
or
asked
any
questions
which
he
might
now
regard
as
a
ground
of
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Jem
Rodney
,
a
known
poacher
,
and
otherwise
disreputable
:
he
had
often
met
Marner
in
his
journeys
across
the
fields
,
and
had
said
something
jestingly
about
the
weaver
's
money
;
nay
,
he
had
once
irritated
Marner
,
by
lingering
at
the
fire
when
he
called
to
light
his
pipe
,
instead
of
going
about
his
business
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
Rodney
was
the
man
 
<EOS>
there
was
ease
in
the
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
could
be
found
and
made
to
restore
the
money
:
Marner
did
not
want
to
punish
him
,
but
only
to
get
back
his
gold
which
had
gone
from
him
,
and
left
his
soul
like
a
forlorn
traveller
on
an
unknown
desert
.
 
<EOS>
The
robber
must
be
laid
hold
of
.
 
<EOS>
Marner
's
ideas
of
legal
authority
were
confused
,
but
he
felt
that
he
must
go
and
proclaim
his
loss
;
and
the
great
people
in
the
village
 
<EOS>
the
clergyman
,
the
constable
,
and
<EOS>
Squire
Cass
 
would
make
Jem
Rodney
,
or
somebody
else
,
deliver
up
the
stolen
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
rushed
out
in
the
rain
,
under
the
stimulus
of
this
hope
,
forgetting
to
cover
his
head
,
not
caring
to
fasten
his
door
;
for
he
felt
as
if
he
had
nothing
left
to
lose
.
 
<EOS>
He
ran
swiftly
,
till
want
of
breath
compelled
him
to
slacken
his
pace
as
he
was
entering
the
village
at
the
turning
close
to
the
Rainbow
.
  
<EOS>
The
Rainbow
,
in
Marner
's
view
,
was
a
place
of
luxurious
resort
for
rich
and
stout
husbands
,
whose
wives
had
superfluous
stores
of
linen
;
it
was
the
place
where
he
was
likely
to
find
the
powers
and
dignities
of
Raveloe
,
and
where
he
could
most
speedily
make
his
loss
public
.
 
<EOS>
He
lifted
the
latch
,
and
turned
into
the
bright
bar
or
kitchen
on
the
right
hand
,
where
the
less
lofty
customers
of
the
house
were
in
the
habit
of
assembling
,
the
parlour
on
the
left
being
reserved
for
the
more
select
society
in
which
Squire
Cass
frequently
enjoyed
the
double
pleasure
of
conviviality
and
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
parlour
was
dark
to
-
night
,
the
chief
personages
who
ornamented
its
circle
being
all
at
Mrs.
Osgood
's
birthday
dance
,
as
Godfrey
Cass
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
consequence
of
this
,
the
party
on
the
high
-
screened
seats
in
the
kitchen
was
more
numerous
than
usual
;
several
personages
,
who
would
otherwise
have
been
admitted
into
the
parlour
and
enlarged
the
opportunity
of
hectoring
and
condescension
for
their
betters
,
being
content
this
evening
to
vary
their
enjoyment
by
taking
their
spirits
-
and
-
water
where
they
could
themselves
hector
and
condescend
in
company
that
called
for
beer
.
    
<EOS>
The
conversation
,
which
was
at
a
high
pitch
of
animation
when
Silas
approached
the
door
of
the
Rainbow
,
had
,
as
usual
,
been
slow
and
intermittent
when
the
company
first
assembled
.
 
<EOS>
The
pipes
began
to
be
puffed
in
a
silence
which
had
an
air
of
severity
;
the
more
important
customers
,
who
drank
spirits
and
sat
nearest
the
fire
,
staring
at
each
other
as
if
a
bet
were
depending
on
the
first
man
who
winked
;
while
the
beer
-
drinkers
,
chiefly
men
in
fustian
jackets
and
smock
-
frocks
,
kept
their
eyelids
down
and
rubbed
their
hands
across
their
mouths
,
as
if
their
draughts
of
beer
were
a
funereal
duty
attended
with
embarrassing
sadness
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
Mr.
Snell
,
the
landlord
,
a
man
of
a
neutral
disposition
,
accustomed
to
stand
aloof
from
human
differences
as
those
of
beings
who
were
all
alike
in
need
of
liquor
,
broke
silence
,
by
saying
in
a
doubtful
tone
to
his
cousin
the
butcher
    
<EOS>
"
Some
folks
'
ud
say
that
was
a
fine
beast
you
druv
in
yesterday
,
Bob
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
butcher
,
a
jolly
,
smiling
,
red
-
haired
man
,
was
not
disposed
to
answer
rashly
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
a
few
puffs
before
he
spat
and
replied
,
"
And
they
would
n't
be
fur
wrong
,
John
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
this
feeble
delusive
thaw
,
the
silence
set
in
as
severely
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
a
red
Durham
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
farrier
,
taking
up
the
thread
of
discourse
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
The
farrier
looked
at
the
landlord
,
and
the
landlord
looked
at
the
butcher
,
as
the
person
who
must
take
the
responsibility
of
answering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Red
it
was
,
"
said
the
butcher
,
in
his
good
-
humoured
husky
treble
 
"
and
a
Durham
it
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
need
n't
tell
_
me
_
who
you
bought
it
of
,
"
said
the
farrier
,
looking
round
with
some
triumph
;
"
I
know
who
it
is
has
got
<EOS>
the
red
Durhams
o
'
<EOS>
this
country
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
'd
a
white
star
on
her
brow
<EOS>
,
I
'll
bet
a
penny
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
farrier
leaned
forward
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
as
he
put
this
question
,
and
his
eyes
twinkled
knowingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
yes
 
she
might
,
"
said
the
butcher
,
slowly
,
considering
that
he
was
giving
a
decided
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
contrairy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
that
very
well
,
"
said
the
farrier
,
throwing
himself
backward
again
,
and
speaking
defiantly
;
"
if
_
I
_
do
n't
know
Mr.
Lammeter
's
cows
,
I
should
like
to
know
who
does
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
cow
you
've
bought
,
bargain
or
no
bargain
,
I
've
been
at
the
drenching
of
her
 
contradick
me
who
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
farrier
looked
fierce
,
and
the
mild
butcher
's
conversational
spirit
was
roused
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
for
contradicking
no
man
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
'm
for
peace
and
quietness
.
 
<EOS>
Some
are
for
cutting
long
ribs
 
<EOS>
I
'm
for
cutting
'em
short
myself
;
but
_
I
_
do
n't
quarrel
with
'em
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
say
is
,
it
's
a
lovely
carkiss
 
and
<EOS>
anybody
as
was
reasonable
,
it
'

bring
tears
into
their
eyes
to
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
's
the
cow
as
I
drenched
,
whatever
it
is
,
"
pursued
the
farrier
,
angrily
;
"
and
it
was
Mr.
Lammeter
's
cow
,
<EOS>
else
you
told
a
lie
when
you
said
it
was
a
red
Durham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
no
lies
,
"
said
the
butcher
,
with
the
same
mild
huskiness
as
before
,
"
and
I
contradick
none
 
<EOS>
not
if
a
man
was
to
swear
himself
black
:
he
's
no
meat
o
'
mine
,
nor
none
<EOS>
o
'
my
bargains

<EOS>
All
I
say
is
,
it
's
a
lovely
carkiss
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
I
say
,
I
'll
stick
to
;
but
I
'll
quarrel
wi
'
no
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
farrier
,
with
bitter
sarcasm
,
looking
at
the
company
generally
;
"
and
p'rhaps
<EOS>
you
are
n't
pig
-
headed
;
and
p'rhaps
<EOS>
you
did
n't
say
the
cow
was
a
red
Durham

and
p'rhaps
<EOS>
you

at

"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come

"
said
the
landlord
;
"
let
the
cow
alone

<EOS>
The
truth
lies
<EOS>
atween
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
:
you
're
both
right
and
both
wrong
,
as
I

<EOS>
And
as
for
the
cow
's
being
Mr.
Lammeter

,
I
say
nothing

this
I

You

Warrens

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
,
tailor
and
parish
-
clerk
,
the
latter
of
which
functions
rheumatism
had
of
late
obliged
him
to
share
with
a
small
-
featured
young
man
who
sat
opposite
him
,
held
his
white
head
on
one
side
,
and
twirled
his
thumbs
with
an
air
of
complacency
,
slightly
seasoned
with
criticism
.
 
<EOS>
He
smiled
pityingly
,
in
answer
to
the
landlord
's
appeal
,
and
said
    
"
Aye

aye
;
I

I

"
If

said
the

with
an
air
of
anxious
propriety
,
"
I

said
a
large
jocose
-
looking
man
,
an
excellent
wheelwright
in
his
week
-
day
capacity
,
but
on
Sundays
leader
of
the
choir
.
 
<EOS>
He
winked
,
as
he
spoke
,
at
two
of
the
company
,
who
were
known
officially
as
the
"
bassoon
"
and
the
"
key
-
bugle
"
,
in
the
confidence
that
he
was
expressing
the
sense
of
the
musical
profession
in
Raveloe
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tookey
,
the
deputy
-
clerk
,
who
shared
the
unpopularity
common
to
deputies
,
turned
very
red
,
but
replied
,
with
careful
moderation
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Winthrop
,
if

any

in

I

not
the

n't
alter
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
's
people
set
up
their
own
ears
for
a
standard
,
and
expect
the
whole
choir
to
follow
'em
.
 
<EOS>
There
may
be
two
opinions
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye

aye

"
said
Mr.
Macey
,
who
felt
very
well
satisfied
with
this
attack
on
youthful
presumption
;
"
you
're
right
there
,
Tookey
:
<EOS>
there
's
allays
two

pinions

there
's
the
'
pinion
a
man
has
of
himsen

and
there
's
the

pinion
other

have
on
him

<EOS>
There
'd
be
two
'
pinions
about
a
cracked
bell
,
if
the
bell
could
hear
itself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Macey
,
"
said
poor
Tookey
,
serious
amidst
the
general
laughter
,
"
I
undertook
to
partially
fill
up
the
office
of
parish
-
clerk
by
Mr.
Crackenthorp
's
desire
,
whenever
your
infirmities
should
make
you
unfitting
;
and
it
's
one
of
the
rights
thereof
to
sing
in
the
choir
 
else
why
have
you
done
the
same
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
the
old
gentleman

you
are
two
folks

"
said
Ben
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
's
got
a
gift
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
Squire
used
to
invite
him
to
take
a
glass
,
only
to
hear
him
sing
the
"
Red
Rovier
"
;
did
n't
he
,
Mr.
Macey
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
nat'ral
gift
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
my
little
lad
<EOS>
Aaron
,
he
's
got
a
gift
 
<EOS>
he
can
sing
a
tune
off
straight
,
like
a
throstle
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
for
you
,
Master
Tookey
,
you
'd
better
stick
to
your
"
Amens
"
:
<EOS>
your
voice
is
well
enough
when
you
keep
it
up
in
your
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
your
inside
as
is
n't
right
made
for
music
<EOS>
:
it
's
no
better
nor
a
hollow
stalk
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
kind
of
unflinching
frankness
was
the
most
piquant
form
of
joke
to
the
company
at
the
Rainbow
,
and
Ben
Winthrop
's
insult
was
felt
by
everybody
to
have
capped
Mr.
Macey
's
epigram
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
what
it
is
plain
enough
,
"
said
Mr.
Tookey
,
unable
to
keep
cool
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
consperacy
to
turn
me
out
<EOS>
o

the
choir
,
as
I
should
n't
share
the
Christmas
money
 
<EOS>
that
's
where
it
is

<EOS>
But
I
shall
speak
to
Mr.
Crackenthorp
;
I
'll
not
be
put
upon
by
no
man

<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
Tookey
,
"
said
Ben
Winthrop
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
pay
you
your
share
to
keep
out
of
it
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
we
'll
do

<EOS>
There
's
things
folks

pay
to
be
rid
on
,
besides
varmin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
who
felt
that
paying
people
for
their
absence
was
a
principle
dangerous
to
society
;
"
a
joke
's
a
joke
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
all
good
friends
here
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
give
and
take
.
<EOS>
You
're
both
right
and
you
're
both
wrong
,
as
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
agree
wi
'
Mr.
Macey
here
,
as
there
's
two
opinions
;
and
if
mine
was
asked
,
I
should
say
they
're
both
right
.
 
<EOS>
Tookey
's
right
and
<EOS>
Winthrop
's
right
,
and
they
've
only
got
to
split
the
difference
and
make
themselves
even
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
farrier
was
puffing
his
pipe
rather
fiercely
,
in
some
contempt
at
this
trivial
discussion
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
ear
for
music
himself
,
and
never
went
to
church
,
as
being
of
the
medical
profession
,
and
likely
to
be
in
requisition
for
delicate
cows
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
butcher
,
having
music
in
his
soul
,
had
listened
with
a
divided
desire
for
Tookey
's
defeat
and
for
the
preservation
of
the
peace
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
he
said
,
following
up
the
landlord
's
conciliatory
view
,
"
we
're
fond
of
our
old
clerk
;
it
's
nat'ral
,
and
him
used
to
be
such
a
singer
,
and
got
a
brother
as
is
known
for
the
first
fiddler
in
this
country
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
it
's
a
pity
but
what
Solomon
lived
in
our
village
,
and
could
give
us
a
tune
when
we
liked
;
eh
,
Mr.
Macey
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
keep
him
in
liver
and
lights
for
nothing
 
that
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
,
in
the
height
of
complacency
;
"
our
family
's
been
known
for
musicianers
as
far
back
as
anybody
can
tell
.
<EOS>
But
them
things
are
dying
out
,
as
I
tell
Solomon
every
time
he
comes
round
;
there
's
no
voices
like
what
there
used
to
be
,
and
there
's
nobody
remembers
what
we
remember
,
if
it
is
n't
the
old
crows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
you
remember
when
first
Mr.
Lammeter
's
father
come
into
these
parts
,
do
n't
you
,
Mr.
Macey
?
"
 
said
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
I
did
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
who
had
now
gone
through
that
complimentary
process
necessary
to
bring
him
up
to
the
point
of
narration
;
"
and
a
fine
old
gentleman
he
was
 
as
fine
,
and
finer
nor
the
Mr.
Lammeter
as
now
is
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
from
a
bit
north'ard
,
so
far
as
I
could
ever
make
out
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
's
<EOS>
nobody
rightly
knows
about
those
parts
:
only
it
could
n't
be
far
north'ard
,
nor
much
different
from
this
country
,
for
he
brought
a
fine
breed
o
'
sheep
with
him
,
so
there
must
be
pastures
there
,
and
<EOS>
everything
reasonable
.
 
<EOS>
We
heared
tell
as
he
'd
sold
his
own
land
to
come
and
take
the
Warrens
,
and
that
seemed
odd
for
a
man
as
had
land
of
his
own
,
to
come
and
rent
a
farm
in
a
strange
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
said
it
was
along
of
his
wife
's
dying
;
though
there
's
reasons
in
things
as
nobody
knows
on
 
<EOS>
that
's
pretty
much
what
I
've
made
out
;
yet
some
folks
are
so
wise
<EOS>
,
they
'll
find
you
fifty
reasons
straight
off
,
and
all
the
while
the
real
reason
's
winking
at
'em
in
the
corner
,
and
they
niver
see't
.
 
<EOS>
Howsomever
,
it
was
soon
seen
as
we
'd
got
a
new
parish'ner
as
know'd
<EOS>
the
rights
and
customs
o
'
things
,
and
kep
a
good
house
,
and
was
well
looked
on
by
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
young
man
 
<EOS>
that
's
the
Mr.
Lammeter
as
now
<EOS>
is
,
for
he
'd
niver
a
sister
 
soon
begun
to
court
Miss
Osgood
<EOS>
,
that
's
<EOS>
the
sister
o
'
<EOS>
the
Mr.
Osgood
as
now
is
,
and
a
fine
handsome
lass
she
was
 
eh
<EOS>
,
you
ca
n't
think
 
they
pretend
this
young
lass
is
like
her
,
but
that
's
the
way
wi
'
people
as
do
n't
know
what
come
before
'em
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
should
know
,
for
I
helped
the
old
rector
,
Mr.
Drumlow
as
was
,
I
helped
him
marry
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Macey
paused
;
he
always
gave
his
narrative
in
instalments
,
expecting
to
be
questioned
according
to
precedent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
and
a
partic'lar
thing
happened
,
did
n't
it
,
Mr.
Macey
,
so
as
you
were
likely
to
remember
that
marriage
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
landlord
,
in
a
congratulatory
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
there
did
 
a
_
very
_
partic'lar
thing
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
,

For
Mr.
Drumlow
 
poor
old
gentleman
,
I
was
fond
on
him
,
though
he
'd
got
a
bit
confused
in
his
head
,
<EOS>
what
wi
'
age
and
wi
'
taking
a
drop
o
'
summat
warm
when
the
service
come
of
a
cold
morning
.
<EOS>
And
young
Mr.
Lammeter
,
he
'd
have
no
way
<EOS>
but
he
must
be
married
in
Janiwary
,
which
,
to
be
sure
,
's
a
unreasonable
time
to
be
married
in
,
<EOS>
for
it
is
n't
like
a
christening
or
a
burying
,
as
you
ca
n't
help
;
and
so
Mr.
Drumlow
 
poor
old
gentleman
<EOS>
,
I
was
fond
on
him
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
come
to
put
the
questions
,
he
put
'em
by
the
rule
o
'
contrairy
,
like
,
and
he
says
,
"
Wilt
thou
have
this
man
to
thy
wedded
wife
?
"
 
<EOS>
says
he
,
and
then
he
says
,
"
Wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
thy
wedded
husband
?
<EOS>
"
says
he
.
<EOS>
But
the
partic'larest
thing
of
all
is
,
as
nobody
took
any
notice
on
it
<EOS>
but
me
,
and
<EOS>
they
answered
straight
off
"
yes
"
,
like
as
if
it
had
been
me
saying
<EOS>
"
Amen
"
i
'
the
right
place
,
without
listening
to
what
went
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
_
you
_
knew
what
was
going
on
well
enough
,
did
n't
you
,
Mr.
Macey
?
<EOS>
You
were
live
enough
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
butcher
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Mr.
Macey
,
pausing
,
and
smiling
in
pity
at
the
impotence
of
his
hearer
's
imagination
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
was
all
of
a
tremble
:
it
was
as
if
I
'd
been
a
coat
pulled
by
the
two
tails
,
like
;
for
I
could
n't
stop
the
parson
,
I
could
n't
take
upon
me
to
do
that
;
and
yet
I
said
to
myself
,
<EOS>
I
says
,
"
Suppose
they
should
n't
be
fast
married
,
'cause
the
words
are
contrairy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
my
head
went
working
like
a
mill
,
<EOS>
for
I
was
allays
uncommon
for
turning
things
over
and
seeing
all
round
'em
;
and
I
says
to
myself
,
"
Is't
<EOS>
the
meanin
'
or
the
words
as
makes
folks
fast
<EOS>
i
'
wedlock
?
"
 
<EOS>
For
the
parson
meant
right
,
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
meant
right
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
when
I
come
to
think
on
it
,
meanin
'
goes
but
<EOS>
a
little
way
<EOS>
i
'
most
things
,
for
you
may
mean
to
stick
things
together
and
your
glue
may
be
bad
,
and
then
where
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
says
to
mysen
,
"
It
is
n't
the
meanin
'
,
it
's
the
glue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
was
worreted
as
if
I
'd
got
three
bells
to
pull
at
once
,
when
we
went
into
the
vestry
,
and
they
begun
to
sign
their
names
.
 
<EOS>
But
where
's
the
use
<EOS>
o
'
talking
?
 
<EOS>
you
ca
n't
think
what
goes
on
in
a
'
cute
man
's
inside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
held
in
for
all
that
,
did
n't
you
,
Mr.
Macey
?
"
 
said
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
I
held
in
tight
till
I
was
by
mysen
<EOS>
wi
'
Mr.
Drumlow
,
and
then
I
out
wi
'
everything
,
but
respectful
,
as
I
allays
did
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
made
light
on
it
,
and
he
says
,
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
Macey
,
make
yourself
easy
,
"
he
says
;
"
it
's
neither
the
meaning
nor
the
words
 
<EOS>
it
's
the
re_ges_ter
<EOS>
does
it
 
<EOS>
that
's
the
glue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
you
see
he
settled
it
easy
;
for
parsons
and
doctors
know
everything
by
heart
,
like
,
so
as
they
are
n't
worreted
wi
'
thinking
what
's
the
rights
and
wrongs
<EOS>
o
'
things
,
as
I'n
been
many
and
many
's
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
sure
enough
the
wedding
turned
out
all
right
,
on'y
<EOS>
poor
Mrs.
Lammeter
 
<EOS>
that
's
Miss
Osgood
as
was
 
<EOS>
died
<EOS>
afore
the
lasses
was
growed
up
;
but
for
prosperity
and
everything
respectable
,
there
's
no
family
more
looked
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Every
one
of
Mr.
Macey
's
audience
had
heard
this
story
many
times
,
but
it
was
listened
to
as
if
it
had
been
a
favourite
tune
,
and
at
certain
points
the
puffing
of
the
pipes
was
momentarily
suspended
,
that
the
listeners
might
give
their
whole
minds
to
the
expected
words
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
more
to
come
;
and
Mr.
Snell
,
the
landlord
,
duly
put
the
leading
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
old
Mr.
Lammeter
had
a
pretty
fortin
,
did
n't
they
say
,
when
he
come
into
these
parts
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
;
"
but
I
daresay
it
's
as
much
as
this
Mr.
Lammeter
's
done
to
keep
it
whole
.
 
<EOS>
For
there
was
allays
a
talk
as
nobody
could
get
rich
on
the
Warrens
:
though
he
holds
it
cheap
,
for
it
's
what
they
call
Charity
Land
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
and
there
's
few
folks
know
so
well
as
you
how
it
come
to
be
Charity
Land
,
eh
,
Mr.
Macey
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
butcher
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
should
they
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
old
clerk
,
with
some
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
grandfather
made
the
grooms
'
livery
for
that
Mr.
Cliff
as
came
and
built
the
big
stables
at
the
Warrens
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
they
're
stables
four
times
as
big
as
Squire
Cass
's
,
for
he
thought
o
'
<EOS>
nothing
but
hosses
and
hunting
,
Cliff
<EOS>
did
n't
 
a
Lunnon
tailor
,
some
folks
said
,
as
had
gone
mad
wi
'
cheating
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
could
n't
ride
;
lor
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
they
said
he
'd
got
no
more
grip
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
hoss
than
if
his
legs
had
been
cross
-
sticks
<EOS>
:
my
grandfather
heared
<EOS>
old
Squire
Cass
say
so
many
and
many
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
ride
he
would
,
as
if
Old
Harry
had
been
a
-
driving
him
;
and
he
'd
a
son
,
a
lad
o
'
sixteen
;
and
nothing
would
his
father
have
him
do
,
but
he
must
ride
and
ride
 
though
the
lad
was
frighted
,
they
said
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
a
common
saying
as
the
father
wanted
to
ride
the
tailor
out
o
'
the
lad
,
and
make
a
gentleman
on
him
 
not
<EOS>
but
what
I
'm
a
tailor
myself
,
but
in
respect
as
God
made
me
such
,
I
'm
proud
on
it
,
for
"
Macey
,
tailor
"
,
's
been
wrote
up
over
our
door
since
afore
<EOS>
the
Queen
's
heads
went
out
on
the
shillings
.
<EOS>
But
Cliff
,
he
was
ashamed
o
'
being
called
a
tailor
,
and
he
was
sore
vexed
as
his
riding
was
laughed
at
,
and
nobody
o
'
<EOS>
the
gentlefolks
hereabout
could
abide
him
.
 
<EOS>
Howsomever
,
the
poor
lad
got
sickly
and
died
,
and
the
father
did
n't
live
long
after
him
,
for
he
got
queerer
nor
ever
,
and
they
said
he
used
to
go
out
<EOS>
i
'
the
dead
o
'
<EOS>
the
night
,
wi
'
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
to
the
stables
,
and
set
a
lot
o
'
lights
burning
,
for
he
got
as
he
could
n't
sleep
;
and
there
he
'd
stand
,
cracking
his
whip
and
looking
at
his
hosses
;
and
they
said
it
was
a
mercy
as
the
stables
did
n't
get
burnt
down
wi
'
the
poor
dumb
creaturs
in
'em
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
last
he
died
raving
,
and
they
found
as
he
'd
left
all
his
property
,
Warrens
and
all
,
to
a
Lunnon
Charity
,
and
that
's
how
the
Warrens
come
to
be
Charity
Land
<EOS>
;
though
,
as
for
the
stables
,
Mr.
Lammeter
never
uses
'em
 
they
're
out
o
<EOS>
'
all
charicter
 
<EOS>
lor
bless
you
!
<EOS>
if
you
was
to
set
the
doors
a
-
banging
in
'em
,
it
'
ud
sound
like
thunder
<EOS>
half
o'er
the
parish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
but
there
's
more
going
on
in
the
stables
than
what
folks
see
by
daylight
,
eh
,
Mr.
Macey
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
;
go
that
way
of
a
dark
night
,
that
's
all
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
,
winking
mysteriously
,
"
and
then
make
believe
,
if
you
like
,
as
you
did
n't
see
lights
<EOS>
i
'
the
stables
,
nor
hear
the
stamping
o
'
the
hosses
,
nor
the
cracking
o
'
the
whips
,
and
howling
,
too
,
if
it
's
tow'rt
daybreak
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cliff
's
Holiday
"
has
been
the
name
of
it
<EOS>
ever
sin
<EOS>
'
I
were
a
boy
;
that
's
to
say
,
some
said
as
it
was
the
holiday
Old
Harry
gev
him
from
roasting
,
like
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
my
father
told
me
,
and
he
was
a
reasonable
man
,
though
there
's
folks
<EOS>
nowadays
know
what
happened
afore
<EOS>
they
were
born
better
nor
they
know
their
own
business

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
to
that
,
eh
,
Dowlas
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
landlord
,
turning
to
the
farrier
,
who
was
swelling
with
impatience
for
his
cue
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
nut
for
_
you
_
to
crack
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dowlas
was
the
negative
spirit
in
the
company
,
and
was
proud
of
his
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
what
a
man
<EOS>
_
should
_
say
as
does
n't
shut
his
eyes
to
look
at
a
finger
-
post

<EOS>
I
say
,
as
I
'm
ready
to
wager
any
man
ten
pound
,
if
he
'll
stand
out
wi
'
me
any
dry
night
in
the
pasture
before
the
Warren
stables
,
as
we
shall
neither
see
lights
nor
hear
noises

if
it
is
n't
the
blowing
of
our
own
noses
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
say

and
I
've
said
it
many
a
time

but
there
's
nobody

<EOS>
"
Why
,
Dowlas
,
that
's
easy
betting

that
is
,
"
said
Ben
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
"
You
might
as
well
bet
a
man

It

If

said
Mr.

with
a
sarcastic
smile

tapping
his
thumbs
together

he
's
no

If

I

Ah

"
No

replied
Mr.

angrily

"
I

now
,
ca
n't
smell
,
not
if
she
'd
<EOS>
the
strongest
o
'
cheese
under
her
nose
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see'd
a
ghost
myself
;
but
<EOS>
then
I
says
to
myself
,
"
Very
like
I
have
n't
got
the
smell
for
'
em
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
putting
a
ghost
for
a
smell
,
or
else
contrairiways
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
I
'm
for
holding
with
both
sides
;
for
,
as
I
say
,
the
truth
lies
between
'em
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
Dowlas
was
to
go
and
stand
,
and
say
he
'd
never
seen
a
wink
o
'
Cliff
's
Holiday
all
the
night
through
,
I
'd
back
him
;
and
if
anybody
said
as
Cliff
's
Holiday
was
certain
sure
,
for
all
that
,
I
'd
back
_
him
_
too
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
smell
's
what
I
go
by
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
landlord
's
analogical
argument
was
not
well
received
by
the
farrier
 
<EOS>
a
man
intensely
opposed
to
compromise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
"
he
said
,
setting
down
his
glass
with
refreshed
irritation
;
"
what
's
the
smell
got
to
do
with
it
?
 
<EOS>
Did
ever
a
ghost
give
a
man
a
black
eye
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
should
like
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
If
ghos'es
want
me
to
believe
in
'em
,
let
'em
leave
off
skulking
i
'
the
dark
<EOS>
and
i
'
lone
places
 
let
'em
come
where
there
's
company
and
candles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
ghos'es
'
ud
want
to
be
believed
in
by
anybody
so
ignirant
!
"
said
Mr.
Macey
,
in
deep
disgust
at
the
farrier
's
crass
incompetence
to
apprehend
the
conditions
of
ghostly
phenomena
.
    
<EOS>
Yet
the
next
moment
there
seemed
to
be
some
evidence
that
ghosts
had
a
more
condescending
disposition
than
Mr.
Macey
attributed
to
them
;
for
the
pale
thin
figure
of
Silas
Marner
was
suddenly
seen
standing
in
the
warm
light
,
uttering
no
word
,
but
looking
round
at
the
company
with
his
strange
unearthly
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
long
pipes
gave
a
simultaneous
movement
,
like
the
antennae
of
startled
insects
,
and
every
man
present
,
not
excepting
even
the
sceptical
farrier
,
had
an
impression
that
he
saw
,
not
Silas
Marner
in
the
flesh
,
but
an
apparition
;
for
the
door
by
which
Silas
had
entered
was
hidden
by
the
high
-
screened
seats
,
and
no
one
had
noticed
his
approach
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
,
sitting
a
long
way
off
the
ghost
,
might
be
supposed
to
have
felt
an
argumentative
triumph
,
which
would
tend
to
neutralize
his
share
of
the
general
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
Had
he
not
always
said
that
when
Silas
Marner
was
in
that
strange
trance
of
his
,
his
soul
went
loose
from
his
body
?
 
<EOS>
Here
was
the
demonstration
:
nevertheless
,
on
the
whole
,
he
would
have
been
as
well
contented
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
there
was
a
dead
silence
,
Marner
's
want
of
breath
and
agitation
not
allowing
him
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
under
the
habitual
sense
that
he
was
bound
to
keep
his
house
open
to
all
company
,
and
confident
in
the
protection
of
his
unbroken
neutrality
,
at
last
took
on
himself
the
task
of
adjuring
the
ghost
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
Marner
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
conciliatory
tone
,
"
what
's
lacking
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
business
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Robbed
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
,
gaspingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
robbed
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
the
constable
 
and
the
Justice
 
and
Squire
Cass
 
and
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lay
hold
on
him
,
Jem
Rodney
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
the
idea
of
a
ghost
subsiding
;
"
he
's
off
his
head
,
I
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
wet
through
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
Rodney
was
the
outermost
man
,
and
sat
conveniently
near
Marner
's
standing
-
place
;
but
he
declined
to
give
his
services
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
lay
hold
on
him
yourself
,
Mr.
Snell
,
if
you
've
a
mind
,
"
said
Jem
,
rather
sullenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
robbed
,
and
murdered
too
,
for
what
I
know
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
muttering
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
Rodney
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
,
turning
and
fixing
his
strange
eyes
on
the
suspected
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
Master
Marner
,
what
do
you
want
wi
'
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Jem
,
trembling
a
little
,
and
seizing
his
drinking
-
can
as
a
defensive
weapon
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
you
stole
my
money
,
"
said
Silas
,
clasping
his
hands
entreatingly
,
and
raising
his
voice
to
a
cry
,
"
give
it
me
back
 
<EOS>
and
I
wo
n't
meddle
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
set
the
constable
on
you
.
<EOS>
Give
it
me
back
,
and
I
'll
let
you
 
<EOS>
I
'll
let
you
have
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
stole
your
money
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Jem
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pitch
this
<EOS>
can
at
your
eye
if
you
talk
o
'
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
my
_
stealing
your
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
now
rising
resolutely
,
and
seizing
Marner
by
the
shoulder
,
"
if
you
've
got
any
information
to
lay
,
speak
it
out
sensible
,
and
show
as
you
're
in
your
right
mind
,
if
you
expect
anybody
to
listen
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
as
wet
as
a
drownded
rat
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
and
dry
yourself
,
and
speak
straight
forrard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
man
,
"
said
the
farrier
,
who
began
to
feel
that
he
had
not
been
quite
on
a
par
with
himself
and
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
's
have
no
more
staring
and
screaming
,
<EOS>
else
we
'll
have
you
strapped
for
a
madman
.
<EOS>
That
was
why
I
did
n't
speak
at
the
first
 
<EOS>
thinks
I
,
the
man
's
run
mad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
make
him
sit
down
,
"
said
several
voices
at
once
,
<EOS>
well
pleased
that
the
reality
of
ghosts
remained
still
an
open
question
.
  
<EOS>
The
landlord
forced
Marner
to
take
off
his
coat
,
and
then
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
aloof
from
every
one
else
,
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
and
in
the
direct
rays
of
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
weaver
,
too
feeble
to
have
any
distinct
purpose
beyond
that
of
getting
help
to
recover
his
money
,
submitted
unresistingly
.
 
<EOS>
The
transient
fears
of
the
company
were
now
forgotten
in
their
strong
curiosity
,
and
all
faces
were
turned
towards
Silas
,
when
the
landlord
,
having
seated
himself
again
,
said
    
"
Now
then
,
Master
Marner
,
what
's
this
you
've
got
to
say
 
as
you
've
been
robbed
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'd
better
not
say
again
as
it
was
me
robbed
him
,
"
cried
Jem
Rodney
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
could
I
ha
'
done
with
his
money
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
as
easy
steal
the
parson
's
surplice
,
and
wear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
Jem
,
and
let
's
hear
what
he
's
got
to
say
,
"
said
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
then
,
Master
Marner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
now
told
his
story
,
under
frequent
questioning
as
the
mysterious
character
of
the
robbery
became
evident
.
  
<EOS>
This
strangely
novel
situation
of
opening
his
trouble
to
his
Raveloe
neighbours
,
of
sitting
in
the
warmth
of
a
hearth
not
his
own
,
and
feeling
the
presence
of
faces
and
voices
which
were
his
nearest
promise
of
help
,
had
doubtless
its
influence
on
Marner
,
in
spite
of
his
passionate
preoccupation
with
his
loss
.
 
<EOS>
Our
consciousness
rarely
registers
the
beginning
of
a
growth
within
us
any
more
than
without
us
:
there
have
been
many
circulations
of
the
sap
before
we
detect
the
smallest
sign
of
the
bud
.
  
<EOS>
The
slight
suspicion
with
which
his
hearers
at
first
listened
to
him
,
gradually
melted
away
before
the
convincing
simplicity
of
his
distress
:
it
was
impossible
for
the
neighbours
to
doubt
that
Marner
was
telling
the
truth
,
not
because
they
were
capable
of
arguing
at
once
from
the
nature
of
his
statements
to
the
absence
of
any
motive
for
making
them
falsely
,
but
because
,
as
Mr.
Macey
observed
,
"
Folks
as
had
the
devil
to
back
<EOS>
'em
were
not
likely
to
be
so
mushed
"
as
poor
Silas
was
.
 
<EOS>
Rather
,
from
the
strange
fact
that
the
robber
had
left
no
traces
,
and
had
happened
to
know
the
nick
of
time
,
utterly
incalculable
by
mortal
agents
,
when
Silas
would
go
away
from
home
without
locking
his
door
,
the
more
probable
conclusion
seemed
to
be
,
that
his
disreputable
intimacy
in
that
quarter
,
if
it
ever
existed
,
had
been
broken
up
,
and
that
,
in
consequence
,
this
ill
turn
had
been
done
to
Marner
by
somebody
it
was
quite
in
vain
to
set
the
constable
after
.
 
<EOS>
Why
this
preternatural
felon
should
be
obliged
to
wait
till
the
door
was
left
unlocked
,
was
a
question
which
did
not
present
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
Jem
Rodney
as
has
done
this
work
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
be
a
-
casting
your
eye
at
poor
Jem
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
a
bit
of
a
reckoning
against
Jem
for
the
matter
of
a
hare
or
so
,
if
anybody
was
bound
to
keep
their
eyes
staring
open
,
and
niver
to
wink
;
but
Jem
's
been
a
-
sitting
here
drinking
his
can
,
like
the
decentest
man
<EOS>
i
'
the
parish
,
since
before
you
left
your
house
,
Master
Marner
,
by
your
own
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
;
"
let
's
have
no
accusing
o
'
the
innicent
.
<EOS>
That
is
n't
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
There
must
be
folks
to
swear
again

a
man
before
he
can
be
ta'en
up

<EOS>
Let
's
have
no
accusing
o

the
innicent
,
Master
Marner
.
<EOS>
"
  
Memory
was
not
so
utterly
torpid
in
Silas
that
it
could
not
be
awakened
by
these
words
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
movement
of
compunction
as
new
and
strange
to
him
as
everything
else
within
the
last
hour
,
he
started
from
his
chair
and
went
close
up
to
Jem
,
looking
at
him
as
if
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
of
the
expression
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
wrong
,
"
he
said
 
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
 
I
ought
to
have
thought
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
to
witness
against
you
,
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
Only
you
'd
been
into
my
house
oftener
than
anybody
else
,
and
so
you
came
into
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
accuse
you
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
accuse
anybody
 
only
,
"
he
added
,
<EOS>
lifting
up
his
hands
to
his
head
,
and
turning
away
with
bewildered
misery
,
"
I
try
 
I
try
to
think
where
my
guineas
can
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
they
're
gone
where
it
's
hot
enough
to
melt
'em
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tchuh
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
farrier
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
asked
,
with
a
cross
-
examining
air
,
"
How
much
money
might
there
be
in
the
bags
,
Master
Marner
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Two
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
pounds
,
twelve
and
sixpence
,
last
night
when
I
counted
it
,
"
said
Silas
,
seating
himself
again
,
with
a
groan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
they
'd
be
none
so
heavy
to
carry
.
 
<EOS>
Some
tramp
's
been
in
,
that
's
all
;
and
as
for
the
no
footmarks
,
and
the
bricks
and
the
sand
being
all
right
 
<EOS>
why
,
your
eyes
are
pretty
much
like
a
insect
's
,
Master
Marner
;
they
're
obliged
to
look
so
close
,
you
ca
n't
see
much
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
opinion
as
,
if
I
'd
been
you
,
or
you
'd
been
me
 
for
it
<EOS>
comes
to
the
same
thing
 
you
would
n't
have
thought
you
'd
found
everything
as
you
left
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
I
vote
is
,
as
two
of
the
sensiblest
o
'
the
company
should
go
with
you
to
Master
Kench
,
the
constable
's
 
<EOS>
he
's
ill
<EOS>
i
'
bed
<EOS>
,
I
know
that
much
 
and
get
him
to
appoint
one
of
us
his
deppity
;
for
that
's
the
law
,
and
I
do
n't
think
anybody
'
ull
take
upon
him
to
contradick
me
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
n't
much
of
a
walk
to
Kench
's
;
and
then
,
if
it
's
me
as
is
deppity
,
I
'll
go
back
with
you
,
Master
Marner
,
and
examine
your
premises
;
and
if
anybody
's
got
any
fault
to
find
with
that
,
I
'll
thank
him
to
stand
up
and
say
it
out
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
pregnant
speech
the
farrier
had
re
-
established
his
self
-
complacency
,
and
waited
with
confidence
to
hear
himself
named
as
one
of
the
superlatively
sensible
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
see
how
the
night
is
,
though
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
who
also
considered
himself
personally
concerned
in
this
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
rains
heavy
still
,
"
he
said
,
returning
from
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
not
the
man
to
be
afraid
<EOS>
o
'
the
rain
,
"
said
the
farrier
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
it
'll
look
bad
when
Justice
Malam
hears
as
respectable
men
like
us
had
a
information
laid
before
'em
and
took
no
steps
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
landlord
agreed
with
this
view
,
and
after
taking
the
sense
of
the
company
,
and
duly
rehearsing
a
small
ceremony
known
in
high
ecclesiastical
life
as
the
_
nolo
episcopari
_
,
he
consented
to
take
on
himself
the
chill
dignity
of
going
to
Kench
's
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
the
farrier
's
strong
disgust
,
Mr.
Macey
now
started
an
objection
to
his
proposing
himself
as
a
deputy
-
constable
;
for
that
oracular
old
gentleman
,
claiming
to
know
the
law
,
stated
,
as
a
fact
delivered
to
him
by
his
father
,
that
no
doctor
could
be
a
constable
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
're
a
doctor
,
I
reckon
,
though
you
're
only
a
cow
-
doctor
 
for
a
fly
's
a
fly
,
though
it
may
be
a
hoss
-
fly
,
"
concluded
Mr.
Macey
,
wondering
a
little
at
his
own
"
'
cuteness
"
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
hot
debate
upon
this
,
the
farrier
being
of
course
indisposed
to
renounce
the
quality
of
doctor
,
but
contending
that
a
doctor
could
be
a
constable
if
he
liked
 
the
law
meant
,
he
need
n't
be
one
if
he
did
n't
like
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
thought
this
was
nonsense
,
since
the
law
was
not
likely
to
be
fonder
of
doctors
than
of
other
folks
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
if
it
was
in
the
nature
of
doctors
more
than
of
other
men
not
to
like
being
constables
,
how
came
Mr.
Dowlas
to
be
so
eager
to
act
in
that
capacity
?
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
do
n't
want
to
act
the
constable
,
"
said
the
farrier
,
driven
into
a
corner
by
this
merciless
reasoning
;
"
and
there
's
no
man
<EOS>
can
say
it
of
me
,
if
he
'd
tell
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
there
's
to
be
any
jealousy
and
en_vy_ing
about
going
to
Kench
's
in
the
rain
,
let
them
go
as
like
it
 
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
get
me
to
go
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
the
landlord
's
intervention
,
however
,
the
dispute
was
accommodated
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dowlas
consented
to
go
as
a
second
person
disinclined
to
act
officially
;
and
so
poor
Silas
,
furnished
with
some
old
coverings
,
turned
out
with
his
two
companions
into
the
rain
again
,
thinking
of
the
long
night
-
hours
before
him
,
not
as
those
do
who
long
to
rest
,
but
as
those
who
expect
to
"
watch
for
the
morning
"
.
    
<EOS>
When
Godfrey
Cass
returned
from
Mrs.
Osgood
's
party
at
midnight
,
he
was
not
much
surprised
to
learn
that
Dunsey
had
not
come
home
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
not
sold
Wildfire
,
and
was
waiting
for
another
chance
 
perhaps
,
on
that
foggy
afternoon
,
he
had
preferred
housing
himself
at
the
Red
Lion
at
Batherley
for
the
night
,
if
the
run
had
kept
him
in
that
neighbourhood
;
for
he
was
not
likely
to
feel
much
concern
about
leaving
his
brother
in
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
's
mind
was
too
full
of
Nancy
Lammeter
's
looks
and
behaviour
,
too
full
of
the
exasperation
against
himself
and
his
lot
,
which
the
sight
of
her
always
produced
in
him
,
for
him
to
give
much
thought
to
Wildfire
,
or
to
the
probabilities
of
Dunstan
's
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
the
whole
village
was
excited
by
the
story
of
the
robbery
,
and
Godfrey
,
like
every
one
else
,
was
occupied
in
gathering
and
discussing
news
about
it
,
and
in
visiting
the
Stone
-
pits
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
had
washed
away
all
possibility
of
distinguishing
foot
-
marks
,
but
a
close
investigation
of
the
spot
had
disclosed
,
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the
village
,
a
tinder
-
box
,
with
a
flint
and
steel
,
half
sunk
in
the
mud
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
Silas
's
tinder
-
box
,
for
the
only
one
he
had
ever
had
was
still
standing
on
his
shelf
;
and
the
inference
generally
accepted
was
,
that
the
tinder
-
box
in
the
ditch
was
somehow
connected
with
the
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
minority
shook
their
heads
,
and
intimated
their
opinion
that
it
was
not
a
robbery
to
have
much
light
thrown
on
it
by
tinder
-
boxes
,
that
Master
Marner
's
tale
had
a
queer
look
with
it
,
and
that
such
things
had
been
known
as
a
man
's
doing
himself
a
mischief
,
and
then
setting
the
justice
to
look
for
the
doer
.
<EOS>
But
when
questioned
closely
as
to
their
grounds
for
this
opinion
,
and
what
Master
Marner
had
to
gain
by
such
false
pretences
,
they
only
shook
their
heads
as
before
,
and
observed
that
there
was
no
knowing
what
some
folks
counted
gain
;
moreover
,
that
everybody
had
a
right
to
their
own
opinions
,
grounds
or
no
grounds
,
and
that
the
weaver
,
as
everybody
knew
,
was
partly
crazy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
,
though
he
joined
in
the
defence
of
Marner
against
all
suspicions
of
deceit
,
also
pooh
-
poohed
the
tinder
-
box
;
indeed
,
repudiated
it
as
a
rather
impious
suggestion
,
tending
to
imply
that
everything
must
be
done
by
human
hands
,
and
that
there
was
no
power
which
could
make
away
with
the
guineas
without
moving
the
bricks
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
turned
round
rather
sharply
on
Mr.
Tookey
,
when
the
zealous
deputy
,
feeling
that
this
was
a
view
of
the
case
peculiarly
suited
to
a
parish
-
clerk
,
carried
it
still
farther
,
and
doubted
whether
it
was
right
to
inquire
into
a
robbery
at
all
when
the
circumstances
were
so
mysterious
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
,
"
concluded
Mr.
Tookey
 
"
as
if
there
was
nothing
but
what
could
be
made
out
by
justices
and
constables
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
you
be
for
overshooting
the
mark
,
Tookey
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
,
nodding
his
head
aside
admonishingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
you
're
allays
at
;
if
I
throw
a
stone
and
hit
,
you
think
there
's
summat
better
than
hitting
,
and
you
try
to
throw
a
stone
beyond
.
<EOS>
What
I
said
was
against
the
tinder
-
box
:
I
said
nothing
against
justices
and
constables
,
for
they
're
o
'
King
George
's
making
,
and
it
'
ud
be
ill
-
becoming
a
man
in
a
parish
office
to
fly
out
again
'
King
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
these
discussions
were
going
on
amongst
the
group
outside
the
Rainbow
,
a
higher
consultation
was
being
carried
on
within
,
under
the
presidency
of
Mr.
Crackenthorp
,
the
rector
,
assisted
by
Squire
Cass
and
other
substantial
parishioners
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
just
occurred
to
Mr.
Snell
,
the
landlord
 
<EOS>
he
being
,
as
he
observed
,
a
man
accustomed
to
put
two
and
two
together
 
to
connect
with
the
tinder
-
box
,
which
,
as
deputy
-
constable
,
he
himself
had
had
the
honourable
distinction
of
finding
,
certain
recollections
of
a
pedlar
who
had
called
to
drink
at
the
house
about
a
month
before
,
and
had
actually
stated
that
he
carried
a
tinder
-
box
about
with
him
to
light
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
surely
,
was
a
clue
to
be
followed
out
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
memory
,
when
duly
impregnated
with
ascertained
facts
,
is
sometimes
surprisingly
fertile
,
Mr.
Snell
gradually
recovered
a
vivid
impression
of
the
effect
produced
on
him
by
the
pedlar
's
countenance
and
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
"
look
with
his
eye
"
which
fell
unpleasantly
on
Mr.
Snell
's
sensitive
organism
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
he
did
n't
say
anything
particular
 
<EOS>
no
,
except
that
about
the
tinder
-
box
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
n't
what
a
man
says
,
it
's
the
way
he
says
it
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
a
swarthy
foreignness
of
complexion
which
boded
little
honesty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
wear
ear
-
rings
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Crackenthorp
wished
to
know
,
having
some
acquaintance
with
foreign
customs
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
 
stay
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
,
"
said
Mr.
Snell
,
like
a
docile
clairvoyante
,
who
would
really
not
make
a
mistake
if
she
could
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
stretching
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
contracting
his
eyes
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
see
the
ear
-
rings
,
he
appeared
to
give
up
the
effort
,
and
said
,
"
Well
,
he
'd
got
ear
-
rings
in
his
box
to
sell
,
so
it
's
nat'ral
to
suppose
he
might
wear
'em
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
called
at
every
house
,
a'most
,
in
the
village
;
there
's
somebody
else
,
mayhap
,
saw
'em
in
his
ears
,
though
I
ca
n't
take
upon
me
rightly
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Snell
was
correct
in
his
surmise
,
that
somebody
else
would
remember
the
pedlar
's
ear
-
rings
.
 
<EOS>
For
on
the
spread
of
inquiry
among
the
villagers
it
was
stated
with
gathering
emphasis
,
that
the
parson
had
wanted
to
know
whether
the
pedlar
wore
ear
-
rings
in
his
ears
,
and
an
impression
was
created
that
a
great
deal
depended
on
the
eliciting
of
this
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
every
one
who
heard
the
question
,
not
having
any
distinct
image
of
the
pedlar
as
_
without
_
ear
-
rings
,
immediately
had
an
image
of
him
_
with
_
ear
-
rings
,
larger
or
smaller
,
as
the
case
might
be
;
and
the
image
was
presently
taken
for
a
vivid
recollection
,
so
that
the
glazier
's
wife
,
a
well
-
intentioned
woman
,
not
given
to
lying
,
and
whose
house
was
among
the
cleanest
in
the
village
,
was
ready
to
declare
,
as
sure
as
ever
she
meant
to
take
the
sacrament
the
very
next
Christmas
that
was
ever
coming
,
that
she
had
seen
big
ear
-
rings
,
in
the
shape
of
the
young
moon
,
in
the
pedlar
's
two
ears
;
while
Jinny
Oates
,
the
cobbler
's
daughter
,
being
a
more
imaginative
person
,
stated
not
only
that
she
had
seen
them
too
,
but
that
they
had
made
her
blood
creep
,
as
it
did
at
that
very
moment
while
there
she
stood
.
  
<EOS>
Also
,
by
way
of
throwing
further
light
on
this
clue
of
the
tinder
-
box
,
a
collection
was
made
of
all
the
articles
purchased
from
the
pedlar
at
various
houses
,
and
carried
to
the
Rainbow
to
be
exhibited
there
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
there
was
a
general
feeling
in
the
village
,
that
for
the
clearing
-
up
of
this
robbery
there
must
be
a
great
deal
done
at
the
Rainbow
,
and
that
no
man
need
offer
his
wife
an
excuse
for
going
there
while
it
was
the
scene
of
severe
public
duties
.
  
<EOS>
Some
disappointment
was
felt
,
and
perhaps
a
little
indignation
also
,
when
it
became
known
that
Silas
Marner
,
on
being
questioned
by
the
Squire
and
the
parson
,
had
retained
no
other
recollection
of
the
pedlar
than
that
he
had
called
at
his
door
,
but
had
not
entered
his
house
,
having
turned
away
at
once
when
Silas
,
holding
the
door
ajar
,
had
said
that
he
wanted
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
This
had
been
Silas
's
testimony
,
though
he
clutched
strongly
at
the
idea
of
the
pedlar
's
being
the
culprit
,
if
only
because
it
gave
him
a
definite
image
of
a
whereabout
for
his
gold
after
it
had
been
taken
away
from
its
hiding
-
place
:
he
could
see
it
now
in
the
pedlar
's
box
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
observed
with
some
irritation
in
the
village
,
that
anybody
but
a
"
blind
creatur
"
like
Marner
would
have
seen
the
man
prowling
about
,
for
how
came
he
to
leave
his
tinder
-
box
in
the
ditch
close
by
,
if
he
had
n't
been
lingering
there
?
 
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
he
had
made
his
observations
when
he
saw
Marner
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Anybody
might
know
 
and
only
look
at
him
 
that
the
weaver
was
a
half
-
crazy
miser
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wonder
the
pedlar
had
n't
murdered
him
;
men
of
that
sort
,
with
rings
in
their
ears
,
had
been
known
for
murderers
often
and
often
;
there
had
been
one
tried
at
the
'
sizes
,
not
so
long
ago
but
what
there
were
people
living
who
remembered
it
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
Cass
,
indeed
,
entering
the
Rainbow
during
one
of
Mr.
Snell
's
frequently
repeated
recitals
of
his
testimony
,
had
treated
it
lightly
,
stating
that
he
himself
had
bought
a
pen
-
knife
of
the
pedlar
,
and
thought
him
a
merry
grinning
fellow
enough
;
it
was
all
nonsense
,
he
said
,
about
the
man
's
evil
looks
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
spoken
of
in
the
village
as
the
random
talk
of
youth
,
"
as
if
it
was
only
Mr.
Snell
who
had
seen
something
odd
about
the
pedlar
!
"
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
there
were
at
least
half
-
a
-
dozen
who
were
ready
to
go
before
Justice
Malam
,
and
give
in
much
more
striking
testimony
than
any
the
landlord
could
furnish
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
hoped
Mr.
Godfrey
would
not
go
to
Tarley
and
throw
cold
water
on
what
Mr.
Snell
said
there
,
and
so
prevent
the
justice
from
drawing
up
a
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
suspected
of
intending
this
,
when
,
after
mid
-
day
,
he
was
seen
setting
off
on
horseback
in
the
direction
of
Tarley
.
  
<EOS>
But
by
this
time
Godfrey
's
interest
in
the
robbery
had
faded
before
his
growing
anxiety
about
Dunstan
and
Wildfire
,
and
he
was
going
,
not
to
Tarley
,
but
to
Batherley
,
unable
to
rest
in
uncertainty
about
them
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
The
possibility
that
Dunstan
had
played
him
the
ugly
trick
of
riding
away
with
Wildfire
,
to
return
at
the
end
of
a
month
,
when
he
had
gambled
away
or
otherwise
squandered
the
price
of
the
horse
,
was
a
fear
that
urged
itself
upon
him
more
,
even
,
than
the
thought
of
an
accidental
injury
;
and
now
that
the
dance
at
Mrs.
Osgood
's
was
past
,
he
was
irritated
with
himself
that
he
had
trusted
his
horse
to
Dunstan
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
trying
to
still
his
fears
,
he
encouraged
them
,
with
that
superstitious
impression
which
clings
to
us
all
,
that
if
we
expect
evil
very
strongly
it
is
the
less
likely
to
come
;
and
when
he
heard
a
horse
approaching
at
a
trot
,
and
saw
a
hat
rising
above
a
hedge
beyond
an
angle
of
the
lane
,
he
felt
as
if
his
conjuration
had
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
sooner
did
the
horse
come
within
sight
,
than
his
heart
sank
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
Wildfire
;
and
in
a
few
moments
more
he
discerned
that
the
rider
was
not
Dunstan
,
but
Bryce
,
who
pulled
up
to
speak
,
with
a
face
that
implied
something
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Godfrey
,
that
's
a
lucky
brother
of
yours
,
that
Master
Dunsey
,
is
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
,
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
has
n't
he
been
home
yet
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Bryce
.
  
<EOS>
"
Home
?
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
What
has
happened
?
 
<EOS>
Be
quick
.
 
<EOS>
What
has
he
done
with
my
horse
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
thought
it
was
yours
,
though
he
pretended
you
had
parted
with
it
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
thrown
him
down
and
broken
his
knees
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
,
flushed
with
exasperation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Worse
than
that
,
"
said
Bryce
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
I
'd
made
a
bargain
with
him
to
buy
the
horse
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
 
a
swinging
price
,
but
I
always
liked
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
does
he
do
but
go
and
stake
him
 
fly
at
a
hedge
with
stakes
in
it
,
atop
of
a
bank
with
a
ditch
before
it
.
<EOS>
The
horse
had
been
dead
a
pretty
good
while
when
he
was
found
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
has
n't
been
home
since
,
has
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Home
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
"
and
he
'd
better
keep
away
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
me
for
a
fool
!
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
known
this
would
be
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
"
said
Bryce
,
"
after
I
'd
bargained
for
the
horse
,
it
did
come
into
my
head
that
he
might
be
riding
and
selling
the
horse
without
your
knowledge
,
for
I
did
n't
believe
it
was
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
Master
Dunsey
was
up
to
his
tricks
sometimes
.
<EOS>
But
where
can
he
be
gone
?
 
<EOS>
He
's
never
been
seen
at
Batherley
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
have
been
hurt
,
for
he
must
have
walked
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hurt
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
never
be
hurt
 
he
's
made
to
hurt
other
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
_
did
_
give
him
leave
to
sell
the
horse
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Bryce
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
wanted
to
part
with
the
horse
 
<EOS>
he
was
always
a
little
too
hard
in
the
mouth
for
me
,
"
said
Godfrey
;
his
pride
making
him
wince
under
the
idea
that
Bryce
guessed
the
sale
to
be
a
matter
of
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
see
after
him
 
<EOS>
I
thought
some
mischief
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
back
now
,
"
he
added
,
turning
the
horse
's
head
,
and
wishing
he
could
get
rid
of
Bryce
;
for
he
felt
that
the
long
-
dreaded
crisis
in
his
life
was
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
coming
on
to
Raveloe
,
are
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
no
,
not
now
,
"
said
Bryce
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
was
_
coming
round
there
,
for
I
had
to
go
to
Flitton
,
and
I
thought
I
might
as
well
take
you
in
my
way
,
and
just
let
you
know
all
I
knew
myself
about
the
horse
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Master
Dunsey
did
n't
like
to
show
himself
till
the
ill
news
had
blown
over
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
perhaps
gone
to
pay
a
visit
at
the
Three
Crowns
,
by
Whitbridge
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
he
's
fond
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
is
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
rather
absently
.
 
<EOS>
Then
rousing
himself
,
he
said
,
with
an
effort
at
carelessness
,
"
We
shall
hear
of
him
soon
enough
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
here
's
my
turning
,
"
said
Bryce
,
not
surprised
to
perceive
that
Godfrey
was
rather
"
down
"
;
"
so
I
'll
bid
you
good
-
day
,
and
wish
I
may
bring
you
better
news
another
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
rode
along
slowly
,
representing
to
himself
the
scene
of
confession
to
his
father
from
which
he
felt
that
there
was
now
no
longer
any
escape
.
 
<EOS>
The
revelation
about
the
money
must
be
made
the
very
next
morning
;
and
if
he
withheld
the
rest
,
Dunstan
would
be
sure
to
come
back
shortly
,
and
,
finding
that
he
must
bear
the
brunt
of
his
father
's
anger
,
would
tell
the
whole
story
out
of
spite
,
even
though
he
had
nothing
to
gain
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
step
,
perhaps
,
by
which
he
might
still
win
Dunstan
's
silence
and
put
off
the
evil
day
:
he
might
tell
his
father
that
he
had
himself
spent
the
money
paid
to
him
by
Fowler
;
and
as
he
had
never
been
guilty
of
such
an
offence
before
,
the
affair
would
blow
over
after
a
little
storming
.
<EOS>
But
Godfrey
could
not
bend
himself
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
that
in
letting
Dunstan
have
the
money
,
he
had
already
been
guilty
of
a
breach
of
trust
hardly
less
culpable
than
that
of
spending
the
money
directly
for
his
own
behoof
;
and
yet
there
was
a
distinction
between
the
two
acts
which
made
him
feel
that
the
one
was
so
much
more
blackening
than
the
other
as
to
be
intolerable
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
a
good
fellow
,
"
he
said
to
himself
;
"
but
I
'm
not
a
scoundrel
 
at
least
,
I
'll
stop
short
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
bear
the
consequences
of
what
I
_
have
_
done
sooner
than
make
<EOS>
believe
I
've
done
what
I
never
would
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
never
have
spent
the
money
for
my
own
pleasure
 
<EOS>
I
was
tortured
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Through
the
remainder
of
this
day
Godfrey
,
with
only
occasional
fluctuations
,
kept
his
will
bent
in
the
direction
of
a
complete
avowal
to
his
father
,
and
he
withheld
the
story
of
Wildfire
's
loss
till
the
next
morning
,
that
it
might
serve
him
as
an
introduction
to
heavier
matter
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
Squire
was
accustomed
to
his
son
's
frequent
absence
from
home
,
and
thought
neither
Dunstan
's
nor
Wildfire
's
non
-
appearance
a
matter
calling
for
remark
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
said
to
himself
again
and
again
,
that
if
he
let
slip
this
one
opportunity
of
confession
,
he
might
never
have
another
;
the
revelation
might
be
made
even
in
a
more
odious
way
than
by
Dunstan
's
malignity
:
_
she
_
might
come
as
she
had
threatened
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
tried
to
make
the
scene
easier
to
himself
by
rehearsal
:
he
made
up
his
mind
how
he
would
pass
from
the
admission
of
his
weakness
in
letting
Dunstan
have
the
money
to
the
fact
that
Dunstan
had
a
hold
on
him
which
he
had
been
unable
to
shake
off
,
and
how
he
would
work
up
his
father
to
expect
something
very
bad
before
he
told
him
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
Squire
was
an
implacable
man
:
he
made
resolutions
in
violent
anger
,
and
he
was
not
to
be
moved
from
them
after
his
anger
had
subsided
 
as
fiery
volcanic
matters
cool
and
harden
into
rock
.
 
<EOS>
Like
many
violent
and
implacable
men
,
he
allowed
evils
to
grow
under
favour
of
his
own
heedlessness
,
till
they
pressed
upon
him
with
exasperating
force
,
and
then
he
turned
round
with
fierce
severity
and
became
unrelentingly
hard
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
his
system
with
his
tenants
:
he
allowed
them
to
get
into
arrears
,
neglect
their
fences
,
reduce
their
stock
,
sell
their
straw
,
and
otherwise
go
the
wrong
way
,
 
and
<EOS>
then
,
when
he
became
short
of
money
in
consequence
of
this
indulgence
,
he
took
the
hardest
measures
and
would
listen
to
no
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
knew
all
this
,
and
felt
it
with
the
greater
force
because
he
had
constantly
suffered
annoyance
from
witnessing
his
father
's
sudden
fits
of
unrelentingness
,
for
which
his
own
habitual
irresolution
deprived
him
of
all
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
(
He
was
not
critical
on
the
faulty
indulgence
which
preceded
these
fits
;
_
that
_
seemed
to
him
natural
enough
.
)
 
<EOS>
Still
there
was
just
the
chance
,
Godfrey
thought
,
that
his
father
's
pride
might
see
this
marriage
in
a
light
that
would
induce
him
to
hush
it
up
,
rather
than
turn
his
son
out
and
make
the
family
the
talk
of
the
country
for
ten
miles
round
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
view
of
the
case
that
Godfrey
managed
to
keep
before
him
pretty
closely
till
midnight
,
and
he
went
to
sleep
thinking
that
he
had
done
with
inward
debating
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
he
awoke
in
the
still
morning
darkness
he
found
it
impossible
to
reawaken
his
evening
thoughts
;
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
tired
out
and
were
not
to
be
roused
to
further
work
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
arguments
for
confession
,
he
could
now
feel
the
presence
of
nothing
but
its
evil
consequences
:
the
old
dread
of
disgrace
came
back
 
the
old
shrinking
from
the
thought
of
raising
a
hopeless
barrier
between
himself
and
Nancy
 
the
old
disposition
to
rely
on
chances
which
might
be
favourable
to
him
,
and
save
him
from
betrayal
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
after
all
,
should
he
cut
off
the
hope
of
them
by
his
own
act
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
seen
the
matter
in
a
wrong
light
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
a
rage
with
Dunstan
,
and
had
thought
of
nothing
but
a
thorough
break
-
up
of
their
mutual
understanding
;
but
what
it
would
be
really
wisest
for
him
to
do
,
was
to
try
and
soften
his
father
's
anger
against
Dunsey
,
and
keep
things
as
nearly
as
possible
in
their
old
condition
.
<EOS>
If
Dunsey
did
not
come
back
for
a
few
days
(
and
Godfrey
did
not
know
but
that
the
rascal
had
enough
money
in
his
pocket
to
enable
him
to
keep
away
still
longer
)
,
everything
might
blow
over
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
rose
and
took
his
own
breakfast
earlier
than
usual
,
but
lingered
in
the
wainscoted
parlour
till
his
younger
brothers
had
finished
their
meal
and
gone
out
;
awaiting
his
father
,
who
always
took
a
walk
with
his
managing
-
man
before
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
breakfasted
at
a
different
hour
in
the
Red
House
,
and
the
Squire
was
always
the
latest
,
giving
a
long
chance
to
a
rather
feeble
morning
appetite
before
he
tried
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
table
had
been
spread
with
substantial
eatables
nearly
two
hours
before
he
presented
himself
 
a
tall
,
stout
man
of
sixty
,
with
a
face
in
which
the
knit
brow
and
rather
hard
glance
seemed
contradicted
by
the
slack
and
feeble
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
His
person
showed
marks
of
habitual
neglect
,
his
dress
was
slovenly
;
and
yet
there
was
something
in
the
presence
of
the
old
Squire
distinguishable
from
that
of
the
ordinary
farmers
in
the
parish
,
who
were
perhaps
every
whit
as
refined
as
he
,
but
,
having
slouched
their
way
through
life
with
a
consciousness
of
being
in
the
vicinity
of
their
"
betters
"
,
wanted
that
self
-
possession
and
authoritativeness
of
voice
and
carriage
which
belonged
to
a
man
who
thought
of
superiors
as
remote
existences
with
whom
he
had
personally
little
more
to
do
than
with
America
or
the
stars
.
 
<EOS>
The
Squire
had
been
used
to
parish
homage
all
his
life
,
used
to
the
presupposition
that
his
family
,
his
tankards
,
and
everything
that
was
his
,
were
the
oldest
and
best
;
and
as
he
never
associated
with
any
gentry
higher
than
himself
,
his
opinion
was
not
disturbed
by
comparison
.
  
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
his
son
as
he
entered
the
room
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
What
,
sir
!
<EOS>
have
n't
_
<EOS>
you
_
had
your
breakfast
yet
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
there
was
no
pleasant
morning
greeting
between
them
;
not
because
of
any
unfriendliness
,
but
because
the
sweet
flower
of
courtesy
is
not
a
growth
of
such
homes
as
the
Red
House
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
"
I
've
had
my
breakfast
,
but
I
was
waiting
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
"
said
the
Squire
,
throwing
himself
indifferently
into
his
chair
,
and
speaking
in
a
ponderous
coughing
fashion
,
which
was
felt
in
Raveloe
to
be
a
sort
of
privilege
of
his
rank
,
while
he
cut
a
piece
of
beef
,
and
held
it
up
before
the
deer
-
hound
that
had
come
in
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ring
the
bell
for
my
ale
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
youngsters
'
business
is
your
own
pleasure
,
mostly
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
hurry
about
it
for
anybody
but
yourselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Squire
's
life
was
quite
as
idle
as
his
sons
'
,
but
it
was
a
fiction
kept
up
by
himself
and
his
contemporaries
in
Raveloe
that
youth
was
exclusively
the
period
of
folly
,
and
that
their
aged
wisdom
was
constantly
in
a
state
of
endurance
mitigated
by
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
waited
,
before
he
spoke
again
,
until
the
ale
had
been
brought
and
the
door
closed
 
an
interval
during
which
Fleet
,
the
deer
-
hound
,
had
consumed
enough
bits
of
beef
to
make
a
poor
man
's
holiday
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
been
a
cursed
piece
of
ill
-
luck
with
Wildfire
,
"
he
began
;
"
happened
the
day
before
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
broke
his
knees
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
Squire
,
after
taking
a
draught
of
ale
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
knew
how
to
ride
better
than
that
,
sir

<EOS>
I
never
threw
a
horse
down
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
,
I
might
ha
'
whistled
for
another
,
for
_
my
_
father
was
n't
quite
so
ready
to
unstring
as
some
other
fathers
I
know
of
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
must
turn
over
a
new
leaf
 
_
<EOS>
they
_
must
.
 
<EOS>
What
with
mortgages
and
arrears
,
I
'm
as
short
o
'
cash
as
a
roadside
pauper
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
fool
Kimble
says
the
newspaper
's
talking
about
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
country
would
n't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
.
 
<EOS>
Prices
'
ud
run
down
like
a
jack
,
and
I
should
never
get
my
arrears
,
not
if
I
sold
all
the
fellows
up
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
's
that
damned
Fowler
<EOS>
,
I
wo
n't
put
up
with
him
any
longer
;
I
've
told
Winthrop
to
go
to
Cox
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
The
lying
scoundrel
told
me
he
'd
be
sure
to
pay
me
a
hundred
last
month
.
 
<EOS>
He
takes
advantage
because
he
's
on
that
outlying
farm
,
and
thinks
I
shall
forget
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Squire
had
delivered
this
speech
in
a
coughing
and
interrupted
manner
,
but
with
no
pause
long
enough
for
Godfrey
to
make
it
a
pretext
for
taking
up
the
word
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
that
his
father
meant
to
ward
off
any
request
for
money
on
the
ground
of
the
misfortune
with
Wildfire
,
and
that
the
emphasis
he
had
thus
been
led
to
lay
on
his
shortness
of
cash
and
his
arrears
was
likely
to
produce
an
attitude
of
mind
the
utmost
unfavourable
for
his
own
disclosure
.
<EOS>
But
he
must
go
on
,
now
he
had
begun
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
worse
than
breaking
the
horse
's
knees
 
<EOS>
he
's
been
staked
and
killed
,
"
he
said
,
as
soon
as
his
father
was
silent
,
and
had
begun
to
cut
his
meat
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
was
n't
thinking
of
asking
you
to
buy
me
another
horse
;
I
was
only
thinking
I
'd
lost
the
means
of
paying
you
with
the
price
of
Wildfire
,
as
I
'd
meant
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Dunsey
took
him
to
the
hunt
to
sell
him
for
me
the
other
day
,
and
after
he
'd
made
a
bargain
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
with
Bryce
,
he
went
after
the
hounds
,
and
took
some
fool
's
leap
or
other
that
did
for
the
horse
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
n't
been
for
that
,
I
should
have
paid
you
a
hundred
pounds
this
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Squire
had
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
was
staring
at
his
son
in
amazement
,
not
being
sufficiently
quick
of
brain
to
form
a
probable
guess
as
to
what
could
have
caused
so
strange
an
inversion
of
the
paternal
and
filial
relations
as
this
proposition
of
his
son
to
pay
him
a
hundred
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
sir
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
sorry
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
to
blame
,
"
said
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fowler
did
pay
that
hundred
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
He
paid
it
to
me
,
when
I
was
over
there
one
day
last
month
.
 
<EOS>
And
Dunsey
bothered
me
for
the
money
,
and
I
let
him
have
it
,
because
I
hoped
I
should
be
able
to
pay
it
you
before
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Squire
was
purple
with
anger
before
his
son
had
done
speaking
,
and
found
utterance
difficult
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
let
Dunsey
have
it
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
long
have
you
been
so
thick
with
Dunsey
that
you
must
_
collogue
_
with
him
to
embezzle
my
money
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
turning
out
a
scamp
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
wo
n't
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
turn
the
whole
pack
of
you
out
of
the
house
together
,
and
marry
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
have
you
to
remember
,
<EOS>
sir
,
my
property
's
got
no
entail
on
it
;
 
since
my
grandfather
's
time
the
Casses
can
do
as
they
like
with
their
land
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
that
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Let
Dunsey
have
the
money
!
<EOS>
Why
should
you
let
Dunsey
have
the
money
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
some
lie
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
lie
,
sir
,
"
said
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
have
spent
the
money
myself
,
but
Dunsey
bothered
me
,
and
I
was
a
fool
,
and
let
him
have
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
meant
to
pay
it
,
whether
he
did
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
I
never
meant
to
embezzle
money
,
and
I
'm
not
the
man
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
knew
me
do
a
dishonest
trick
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Dunsey
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
stand
talking
there
for
?
 
<EOS>
Go
and
fetch
Dunsey
,
as
I
tell
you
,
and
let
him
give
account
of
what
he
wanted
the
money
for
,
and
what
he
's
done
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
turn
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
,
and
I
'll
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
sha
n't
brave
me
.
 
<EOS>
Go
and
fetch
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dunsey
is
n't
come
back
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
did
he
break
his
own
neck
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
Squire
,
with
some
disgust
at
the
idea
that
,
in
that
case
,
he
could
not
fulfil
his
threat
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
was
n't
hurt
,
I
believe
,
for
the
horse
was
found
dead
,
and
Dunsey
must
have
walked
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
daresay
we
shall
see
him
again
by
-
and
-
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
he
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
must
you
be
letting
him
have
my
money
for
?
 
<EOS>
Answer
me
that
,
"
said
the
Squire
,
attacking
Godfrey
again
,
since
Dunsey
was
not
within
reach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
hesitatingly
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
a
feeble
evasion
,
but
Godfrey
was
not
fond
of
lying
,
and
,
not
being
sufficiently
aware
that
no
sort
of
duplicity
can
long
flourish
without
the
help
of
vocal
falsehoods
,
he
was
quite
unprepared
with
invented
motives
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
it
is
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
been
up
to
some
trick
,
and
you
've
been
bribing
him
not
to
tell
,
"
said
the
Squire
,
with
a
sudden
acuteness
which
startled
Godfrey
,
who
felt
his
heart
beat
violently
at
the
nearness
of
his
father
's
guess
.
 
<EOS>
The
sudden
alarm
pushed
him
on
to
take
the
next
step
 
a
very
slight
impulse
suffices
for
that
on
a
downward
road
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
trying
to
speak
with
careless
ease
,
"
it
was
a
little
affair
between
me
and
Dunsey
;
it
's
no
matter
to
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
It
's
hardly
worth
while
to
pry
into
young
men
's
fooleries
:
it
would
n't
have
made
any
difference
to
you
,
sir
,
if
I
'd
not
had
the
bad
luck
to
lose
Wildfire
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
paid
you
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fooleries
!
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
 
<EOS>
it
's
time
you
'd
done
with
fooleries
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'd
have
you
know
,
<EOS>
sir
,
you
_
must
_
ha
'
done
with
'
em
,
"
said
the
Squire
,
frowning
and
casting
an
angry
glance
at
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
goings
-
on
are
not
what
I
shall
find
money
for
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
my
grandfather
<EOS>
had
his
stables
full
o
'
horses
,
and
kept
a
good
house
,
too
,
and
in
worse
times
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
;
and
so
might
I
,
if
I
had
n't
four
good
-
for
-
nothing
fellows
to
hang
on
me
like
horse
-
leeches
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
too
good
a
father
to
you
all
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
pull
up
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
likely
to
be
very
penetrating
in
his
judgments
,
but
he
had
always
had
a
sense
that
his
father
's
indulgence
had
not
been
kindness
,
and
had
had
a
vague
longing
for
some
discipline
that
would
have
checked
his
own
errant
weakness
and
helped
his
better
will
.
 
<EOS>
The
Squire
ate
his
bread
and
meat
hastily
,
took
a
deep
draught
of
ale
,
then
turned
his
chair
from
the
table
,
and
began
to
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
all
the
worse
for
you
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
you
'd
need
try
and
help
me
keep
things
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
've
often
offered
to
take
the
management
of
things
,
but
you
know
you
've
taken
it
ill
always
,
and
seemed
to
think
I
wanted
to
push
you
out
of
your
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
<EOS>
o
'
your
offering
or
o
'
<EOS>
my
taking
it
ill
,
"
said
the
Squire
,
whose
memory
consisted
in
certain
strong
impressions
unmodified
by
detail
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
,
one
while
you
seemed
to
be
thinking
o
'
marrying
,
and
<EOS>
I
did
n't
offer
to
put
any
obstacles
in
your
way
,
as
some
fathers
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
as
lieve
<EOS>
you
married
Lammeter
's
daughter
as
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
if
I
'd
said
you
nay
,
you
'd
ha
'
kept
on
with
it
;
but
,
for
want
o
'
contradiction
,
you
've
changed
your
mind
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
shilly
-
shally
fellow
:
you
take
after
your
poor
mother
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
had
a
will
of
her
own
;
a
woman
has
no
call
for
one
,
if
she
's
got
a
proper
man
for
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
But
_
your
_
wife
had
need
have
one
,
for
you
hardly
know
your
own
mind
enough
to
make
both
your
legs
walk
one
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
lass
has
n't
said
downright
she
wo
n't
have
you
,
has
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
feeling
very
hot
and
uncomfortable
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
think
she
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
!
 
<EOS>
why
have
n't
you
the
courage
to
ask
her
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
stick
to
it
,
you
want
to
have
_
her
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
that
's
the
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
other
woman
I
want
to
marry
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
evasively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
let
me
make
the
offer
for
you
,
that
's
all
,
if
you
have
n't
the
pluck
to
do
it
yourself

<EOS>
Lammeter
is
n't
likely
to
be
loath
for
his
daughter
to
marry
into
_
my
_
family
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
And
as
for

pretty
lass

she

her
cousin

<EOS>
"
I

rather
let
it
be

at
present

said
Godfrey
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
's
a
little
offended
with
me
just
now
,
and
I
should
like
to
speak
for
myself

<EOS>
A
man

<EOS>
"
Well

then

manage
it

turn
over

That

what

<EOS>
"
I
do
n't

how
I
can

<EOS>
You
would
n't
like
to
settle
me
on
one
of
the
farms

I
do

think

Not

's
all

said
the
Squire
,
with
a
short
,
scornful
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
let
the
thing
be

at

Godfrey

it

saying
anything

I
shall
do
what
I
choose

said
the
Squire

I
shall
let
you
know

may
turn
out

estate

else

Go
out

tell

not

go
to
Cox

wait
for

tell

And
stop

look
out

get

hack

sold

me
the
money

you

<EOS>
He
'll
keep
no

said
Godfrey

moving
towards
the
door

"
Confound
it

taking
up
a
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
left
the
room
,
hardly
knowing
whether
he
were
more
relieved
by
the
sense
that
the
interview
was
ended
without
having
made
any
change
in
his
position
,
or
more
uneasy
that
he
had
entangled
himself
still
further
in
prevarication
and
deceit
.
 
<EOS>
What
had
passed
about
his
proposing
to
Nancy
had
raised
a
new
alarm
,
lest
by
some
after
-
dinner
words
of
his
father
's
to
Mr.
Lammeter
<EOS>
he
should
be
thrown
into
the
embarrassment
of
being
obliged
absolutely
to
decline
her
when
she
seemed
to
be
within
his
reach
.
 
<EOS>
He
fled
to
his
usual
refuge
,
that
of
hoping
for
some
unforeseen
turn
of
fortune
,
some
favourable
chance
which
would
save
him
from
unpleasant
consequences
 
perhaps
even
justify
his
insincerity
by
manifesting
its
prudence
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
point
of
trusting
to
some
throw
of
fortune
's
dice
,
Godfrey
can
hardly
be
called
specially
old
-
fashioned
.
 
<EOS>
Favourable
Chance
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
,
is
the
god
of
all
men
who
follow
their
own
devices
instead
of
obeying
a
law
they
believe
in
.
 
<EOS>
Let
even
a
polished
man
of
these
days
get
into
a
position
he
is
ashamed
to
avow
,
and
his
mind
will
be
bent
on
all
the
possible
issues
that
may
deliver
him
from
the
calculable
results
of
that
position
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
live
outside
his
income
,
or
shirk
the
resolute
honest
work
that
brings
wages
,
and
he
will
presently
find
himself
dreaming
of
a
possible
benefactor
,
a
possible
simpleton
who
may
be
cajoled
into
using
his
interest
,
a
possible
state
of
mind
in
some
possible
person
not
yet
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
Let
him
neglect
the
responsibilities
of
his
office
,
and
he
will
inevitably
anchor
himself
on
the
chance
that
the
thing
left
undone
may
turn
out
not
to
be
of
the
supposed
importance
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
betray
his
friend
's
confidence
,
and
he
will
adore
that
same
cunning
complexity
called
Chance
,
which
gives
him
the
hope
that
his
friend
will
never
know
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
forsake
a
decent
craft
that
he
may
pursue
the
gentilities
of
a
profession
to
which
nature
never
called
him
,
and
his
religion
will
infallibly
be
the
worship
of
blessed
Chance
,
which
he
will
believe
in
as
the
mighty
creator
of
success
.
 
<EOS>
The
evil
principle
deprecated
in
that
religion
is
the
orderly
sequence
by
which
the
seed
brings
forth
a
crop
after
its
kind
.
    
<EOS>
Justice
Malam
was
naturally
regarded
in
Tarley
and
Raveloe
as
a
man
of
capacious
mind
,
seeing
that
he
could
draw
much
wider
conclusions
without
evidence
than
could
be
expected
of
his
neighbours
who
were
not
on
the
Commission
of
the
Peace
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
man
was
not
likely
to
neglect
the
clue
of
the
tinder
-
box
,
and
an
inquiry
was
set
on
foot
concerning
a
pedlar
,
name
unknown
,
with
curly
black
hair
and
a
foreign
complexion
,
carrying
a
box
of
cutlery
and
jewellery
,
and
wearing
large
rings
in
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
But
either
because
inquiry
was
too
slow
-
footed
to
overtake
him
,
or
because
the
description
applied
to
so
many
pedlars
that
inquiry
did
not
know
how
to
choose
among
them
,
weeks
passed
away
,
and
there
was
no
other
result
concerning
the
robbery
than
a
gradual
cessation
of
the
excitement
it
had
caused
in
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
Cass
's
absence
was
hardly
a
subject
of
remark
:
he
had
once
before
had
a
quarrel
with
his
father
,
and
had
gone
off
,
nobody
knew
whither
,
to
return
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
,
take
up
his
old
quarters
unforbidden
,
and
swagger
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
family
,
who
equally
expected
this
issue
,
with
the
sole
difference
that
the
Squire
was
determined
this
time
to
forbid
him
the
old
quarters
,
never
mentioned
his
absence
;
and
when
his
uncle
Kimble
or
Mr.
Osgood
noticed
it
,
the
story
of
his
having
killed
Wildfire
,
and
committed
some
offence
against
his
father
,
was
enough
to
prevent
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
To
connect
the
fact
of
Dunsey
's
disappearance
with
that
of
the
robbery
occurring
on
the
same
day
,
lay
quite
away
from
the
track
of
every
one
's
thought
 
<EOS>
even
Godfrey
's
,
who
had
better
reason
than
any
one
else
to
know
what
his
brother
was
capable
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
remembered
no
mention
of
the
weaver
between
them
since
the
time
,
twelve
years
ago
,
when
it
was
their
boyish
sport
to
deride
him
;
and
,
besides
,
his
imagination
constantly
created
an
_
alibi
_
for
Dunstan
:
he
saw
him
continually
in
some
congenial
haunt
,
to
which
he
had
walked
off
on
leaving
Wildfire
 
<EOS>
saw
him
sponging
on
chance
acquaintances
,
and
meditating
a
return
home
to
the
old
amusement
of
tormenting
his
elder
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Even
if
any
brain
in
Raveloe
had
put
the
said
two
facts
together
,
I
doubt
whether
a
combination
so
injurious
to
the
prescriptive
respectability
of
a
family
with
a
mural
monument
and
venerable
tankards
,
would
not
have
been
suppressed
as
of
unsound
tendency
.
 
<EOS>
But
Christmas
puddings
,
brawn
,
and
abundance
of
spirituous
liquors
,
throwing
the
mental
originality
into
the
channel
of
nightmare
,
are
great
preservatives
against
a
dangerous
spontaneity
of
waking
thought
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
robbery
was
talked
of
at
the
Rainbow
and
elsewhere
,
in
good
company
,
the
balance
continued
to
waver
between
the
rational
explanation
founded
on
the
tinder
-
box
,
and
the
theory
of
an
impenetrable
mystery
that
mocked
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
The
advocates
of
the
tinder
-
box
-
and
-
pedlar
view
considered
the
other
side
a
muddle
-
headed
and
credulous
set
,
who
,
because
they
themselves
were
wall
-
eyed
,
supposed
everybody
else
to
have
the
same
blank
outlook
;
and
the
adherents
of
the
inexplicable
more
than
hinted
that
their
antagonists
were
animals
inclined
to
crow
before
they
had
found
any
corn
 
<EOS>
mere
skimming
-
dishes
in
point
of
depth
 
whose
clear
-
sightedness
consisted
in
supposing
there
was
nothing
behind
a
barn
-
door
because
they
could
n't
see
through
it
;
so
that
,
though
their
controversy
did
not
serve
to
elicit
the
fact
concerning
the
robbery
,
it
elicited
some
true
opinions
of
collateral
importance
.
  
<EOS>
But
while
poor
Silas
's
loss
served
thus
to
brush
the
slow
current
of
Raveloe
conversation
,
Silas
himself
was
feeling
the
withering
desolation
of
that
bereavement
about
which
his
neighbours
were
arguing
at
their
ease
.
 
<EOS>
To
any
one
who
had
observed
him
before
he
lost
his
gold
,
it
might
have
seemed
that
so
withered
and
shrunken
a
life
as
his
could
hardly
be
susceptible
of
a
bruise
,
could
hardly
endure
any
subtraction
but
such
as
would
put
an
end
to
it
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
reality
it
had
been
an
eager
life
,
filled
with
immediate
purpose
which
fenced
him
in
from
the
wide
,
cheerless
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
clinging
life
;
and
though
the
object
round
which
<EOS>
its
fibres
had
clung
was
a
dead
disrupted
thing
,
it
satisfied
the
need
for
clinging
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
the
fence
was
broken
down
 
<EOS>
the
support
was
snatched
away
.
 
<EOS>
Marner
's
thoughts
could
no
longer
move
in
their
old
round
,
and
were
baffled
by
a
blank
like
that
which
meets
a
plodding
ant
when
the
earth
has
broken
away
on
its
homeward
path
.
 
<EOS>
The
loom
was
there
,
and
the
weaving
,
and
the
growing
pattern
in
the
cloth
;
but
the
bright
treasure
in
the
hole
under
his
feet
was
gone
;
the
prospect
of
handling
and
counting
it
was
gone
:
the
evening
had
no
phantasm
of
delight
to
still
the
poor
soul
's
craving
.
 
<EOS>
The
thought
of
the
money
he
would
get
by
his
actual
work
could
bring
no
joy
,
for
its
meagre
image
was
only
a
fresh
reminder
of
his
loss
;
and
hope
was
too
heavily
crushed
by
the
sudden
blow
for
his
imagination
to
dwell
on
the
growth
of
a
new
hoard
from
that
small
beginning
.
  
<EOS>
He
filled
up
the
blank
with
grief
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
sat
weaving
,
he
every
now
and
then
moaned
low
,
like
one
in
pain
<EOS>
:
it
was
the
sign
that
his
thoughts
had
come
round
again
to
the
sudden
chasm
 
to
the
empty
evening
-
time
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
evening
,
as
he
sat
in
his
loneliness
by
his
dull
fire
,
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
clasped
his
head
with
his
hands
,
and
moaned
very
low
 
not
as
one
who
seeks
to
be
heard
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
he
was
not
utterly
forsaken
in
his
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
The
repulsion
Marner
had
always
created
in
his
neighbours
was
partly
dissipated
by
the
new
light
in
which
this
misfortune
had
shown
him
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
a
man
who
had
more
cunning
than
honest
folks
could
come
by
,
and
,
what
was
worse
,
had
not
the
inclination
to
use
that
cunning
in
a
neighbourly
way
,
it
was
now
apparent
that
Silas
had
not
cunning
enough
to
keep
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
generally
spoken
of
as
a
"
poor
mushed
creatur
"
;
and
that
avoidance
of
his
neighbours
,
which
had
before
been
referred
to
his
ill
-
will
and
to
a
probable
addiction
to
worse
company
,
was
now
considered
mere
craziness
.
  
<EOS>
This
change
to
a
kindlier
feeling
was
shown
in
various
ways
.
 
<EOS>
The
odour
of
Christmas
cooking
being
on
the
wind
<EOS>
,
it
was
the
season
when
superfluous
pork
and
black
puddings
are
suggestive
of
charity
in
well
-
to
-
do
families
;
and
Silas
's
misfortune
had
brought
him
uppermost
in
the
memory
of
housekeepers
like
Mrs.
Osgood
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crackenthorp
,
too
,
while
he
admonished
Silas
that
his
money
had
probably
been
taken
from
him
because
he
thought
too
much
of
it
and
never
came
to
church
,
enforced
the
doctrine
by
a
present
of
pigs
'
pettitoes
,
well
calculated
to
dissipate
unfounded
prejudices
against
the
clerical
character
.
<EOS>
Neighbours
who
had
nothing
but
verbal
consolation
to
give
showed
a
disposition
not
only
to
greet
Silas
and
discuss
his
misfortune
at
some
length
when
they
encountered
him
in
the
village
,
but
also
to
take
the
trouble
of
calling
at
his
cottage
and
getting
him
to
repeat
all
the
details
on
the
very
spot
;
and
then
they
would
try
to
cheer
him
by
saying
,
"
Well
,
Master
Marner
,
you
're
no
worse
off
nor
other
poor
folks
,
after
all
;
and
if
you
was
to
be
crippled
,
the
parish
'
ud
give
you
a
'
lowance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
one
reason
why
we
are
seldom
able
to
comfort
our
neighbours
with
our
words
is
that
our
goodwill
gets
adulterated
,
in
spite
of
ourselves
,
before
it
can
pass
our
lips
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
send
black
puddings
and
pettitoes
without
giving
them
a
flavour
of
our
own
egoism
;
but
language
is
a
stream
that
is
almost
sure
to
smack
of
a
mingled
soil
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fair
proportion
of
kindness
in
Raveloe
;
but
it
was
often
of
a
beery
and
bungling
sort
,
and
took
the
shape
least
allied
to
the
complimentary
and
hypocritical
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
,
for
example
,
coming
one
evening
expressly
to
let
Silas
know
that
recent
events
had
given
him
the
advantage
of
standing
more
favourably
in
the
opinion
of
a
man
whose
judgment
was
not
formed
lightly
,
opened
the
conversation
by
saying
,
as
soon
as
he
had
seated
himself
and
adjusted
his
thumbs
    
"
Come
,
Master
Marner
,
why
,
you
've
no
call
to
sit
a
-
moaning
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
deal
better
off
to
ha
'
lost
your
money
,
nor
to
ha
'
kep
it
by
foul
means
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
,
when
you
first
come
into
these
parts
,
as
you
were
no
better
nor
you
should
be
;
you
were
younger
a
deal
than
what
you
are
now
;
but
you
were
allays
a
staring
,
white
-
faced
creatur
,
partly
like
a
bald
-
faced
calf
,
as
I
may
say
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
's
no
knowing
<EOS>
:
it
is
n't
every
queer
-
looksed
thing
as
Old
Harry
's
had
the
making
of
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
speaking
o
'
toads
and
such
;
for
they
're
often
harmless
,
like
,
and
useful
against
varmin
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
pretty
much
the
same
wi
'
you
,
as
fur
as
I
can
see
.
 
<EOS>
Though
as
to
the
yarbs
and
stuff
to
cure
the
breathing
,
if
you
brought
that
sort
o
'
knowledge
from
distant
parts
,
you
might
ha
'
been
a
bit
freer
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
if
the
knowledge
was
n't
well
come
by
<EOS>
,
why
,
you
might
ha
'
made
up
for
it
by
coming
to
church
reg'lar
;
for
,
as
for
the
children
as
the
Wise
Woman
charmed
,
I
've
been
at
the
christening
of
'em
again
and
again
,
and
they
took
the
water
just
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
's
reasonable
;
for
if
Old
Harry
's
a
mind
to
do
a
bit
o
'
kindness
for
a
holiday
,
like
,
who
's
got
anything
against
it
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
thinking
;
and
I
've
been
clerk
o
'
<EOS>
this
parish
forty
year
,
<EOS>
and
I
know
,
when
the
parson
and
me
does
the
cussing
of
a
Ash
<EOS>
Wednesday
,
there
's
no
cussing
o
'
folks
as
have
a
mind
to
be
cured
without
a
doctor
,
let
Kimble
say
what
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
Master
Marner
,
as
I
was
saying
 
for
there
's
windings
<EOS>
i
'
things
as
they
may
carry
you
to
<EOS>
the
fur
end
o
'
<EOS>
the
prayer
-
book
afore
you
get
back
to
'em
 
<EOS>
my
advice
is
,
as
you
keep
up
your
sperrits
;
for
as
for
thinking
you
're
a
deep
un
,
and
ha
'
got
more
inside
you
nor
'
ull
bear
daylight
<EOS>
,
I
'm
not
o
'
<EOS>
that
opinion
at
all
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
tell
the
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
says
I
,
you
talk
o
'
Master
Marner
making
out
a
tale
 
<EOS>
why
,
it
's
nonsense
,
that
is
:
<EOS>
it
'
ud
take
a
'
cute
man
to
make
a
tale
like
that
;
and
,
says
I
,
he
looked
as
scared
as
a
rabbit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
During
this
discursive
address
Silas
had
continued
motionless
in
his
previous
attitude
,
leaning
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
pressing
his
hands
against
his
head
.

Mr.
Macey
,
not
doubting
that
he
had
been
listened
to
,
paused
,
in
the
expectation
of
some
appreciatory
reply
,
but
Marner
remained
silent
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
sense
that
the
old
man
meant
to
be
good
-
natured
and
neighbourly
;
but
the
kindness
fell
on
him
as
sunshine
falls
on
the
wretched
 
he
had
no
heart
to
taste
it
,
and
felt
that
it
was
very
far
off
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Master
Marner
,
have
you
got
nothing
to
say
to
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Mr.
Macey
at
last
,
with
a
slight
accent
of
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
Marner
,
slowly
,
shaking
his
head
between
his
hands
,
"
<EOS>
I
thank
you
 
thank
you
 
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
to
be
sure
:
I
thought
you
would
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
;
"
and
my
advice
is
 
<EOS>
have
you
got
a
Sunday
suit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Marner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubted
it
was
so
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
let
me
advise
you
to
get
a
Sunday
suit
:
there
's
Tookey
,
he
's
a
poor
creatur
,
but
he
's
got
my
tailoring
business
,
and
some
o
'
<EOS>
my
money
in
it
,
and
he
shall
make
a
suit
at
a
low
price
,
and
give
you
trust
,
and
then
you
can
come
to
church
,
and
be
a
bit
neighbourly
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
've
never
heared
me
say
"
Amen
"
since
you
come
into
these
parts
,
and
I
recommend
you
to
lose
no
time
,
for
it
'll
be
poor
work
when
Tookey
has
it
all
to
himself
,
for
I
may
n't
be
equil
to
stand
i
'
the
desk
at
all
<EOS>
,
come
another
winter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Macey
paused
,
perhaps
expecting
some
sign
of
emotion
in
his
hearer
;
but
not
observing
any
,
he
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
money
for
the
suit
o
'
clothes
,
why
,
you
get
a
matter
of
a
pound
a
-
week
at
your
weaving
,
Master
Marner
,
and
you
're
a
young
man
,
eh
,
for
all
you
look
so
mushed
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
could
n't
ha
'
been
five
-
and
-
twenty
when
you
come
into
these
parts
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
started
a
little
at
the
change
to
a
questioning
tone
,
and
answered
mildly
,
"
I
do
n't
know
;
I
ca
n't
rightly
say
 
it
's
a
long
while
since
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
receiving
such
an
answer
as
this
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
Mr.
Macey
observed
,
later
on
in
the
evening
at
the
Rainbow
,
that
Marner
's
head
was
"
all
of
a
muddle
"
,
and
that
it
was
to
be
doubted
if
he
ever
knew
when
Sunday
came
round
,
which
showed
him
a
worse
heathen
than
many
a
dog
.
  
<EOS>
Another
of
Silas
's
comforters
,
besides
Mr.
Macey
,
came
to
him
with
a
mind
highly
charged
on
the
same
topic
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
the
wheelwright
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
Raveloe
were
not
severely
regular
in
their
church
-
going
,
and
perhaps
there
was
hardly
a
person
in
the
parish
who
would
not
have
held
that
to
go
to
church
every
Sunday
in
the
calendar
would
have
shown
a
greedy
desire
to
stand
well
with
Heaven
,
and
get
an
undue
advantage
over
their
neighbours
 
a
wish
to
be
better
than
the
"
common
run
"
,
that
would
have
implied
a
reflection
on
those
who
had
had
godfathers
and
godmothers
as
well
as
themselves
,
and
had
an
equal
right
to
the
burying
-
service
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
it
was
understood
to
be
requisite
for
all
who
were
not
household
servants
,
or
young
men
,
to
take
the
sacrament
at
one
of
the
great
festivals
:
<EOS>
Squire
Cass
himself
took
it
on
Christmas
-
day
;
while
those
who
were
held
to
be
"
good
livers
"
went
to
church
with
greater
,
though
still
with
moderate
,
frequency
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Winthrop
was
one
of
these
:
she
was
in
all
respects
a
woman
of
scrupulous
conscience
,
so
eager
for
duties
that
life
seemed
to
offer
them
too
scantily
unless
she
rose
at
half
-
past
four
,
though
this
threw
a
scarcity
of
work
over
the
more
advanced
hours
of
the
morning
,
which
it
was
a
constant
problem
with
her
to
remove
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
she
had
not
the
vixenish
temper
which
is
sometimes
supposed
to
be
a
necessary
condition
of
such
habits
<EOS>
:
she
was
a
very
mild
,
patient
woman
,
whose
nature
it
was
to
seek
out
all
the
sadder
and
more
serious
elements
of
life
,
and
pasture
her
mind
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
the
person
<EOS>
always
first
thought
of
in
Raveloe
when
there
was
illness
or
death
in
a
family
,
when
leeches
were
to
be
applied
,
or
there
was
a
sudden
disappointment
in
a
monthly
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
"
comfortable
woman
"
 
<EOS>
good
-
looking
,
fresh
-
complexioned
,
having
her
lips
always
slightly
screwed
,
as
if
she
felt
herself
in
a
sick
-
room
with
the
doctor
or
the
clergyman
present
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
never
whimpering
;
no
one
had
seen
her
shed
tears
;
she
was
simply
grave
and
inclined
to
shake
her
head
and
sigh
,
almost
imperceptibly
,
like
a
funereal
mourner
who
is
not
a
relation
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
surprising
that
Ben
Winthrop
,
who
loved
his
quart
-
pot
and
his
joke
,
got
along
so
well
with
Dolly
;
but
she
took
her
husband
's
jokes
and
joviality
as
patiently
as
everything
else
,
considering
that
"
men
_
would
_
be
so
"
,
and
viewing
the
stronger
sex
in
the
light
of
animals
whom
it
had
pleased
Heaven
to
make
naturally
troublesome
,
like
bulls
and
turkey
-
cocks
.
  
<EOS>
This
good
wholesome
woman
could
hardly
fail
to
have
her
mind
drawn
strongly
towards
Silas
Marner
,
now
that
he
appeared
in
the
light
of
a
sufferer
;
and
one
Sunday
afternoon
she
took
her
little
boy
Aaron
with
her
,
and
went
to
call
on
Silas
,
carrying
in
her
hand
some
small
lard
-
cakes
,
flat
paste
-
like
articles
much
esteemed
in
Raveloe
.
<EOS>
Aaron
,
an
apple
-
cheeked
youngster
of
seven
,
with
a
clean
starched
frill
which
looked
like
a
plate
for
the
apples
,
needed
all
his
adventurous
curiosity
to
embolden
him
against
the
possibility
that
the
big
-
eyed
weaver
might
do
him
some
bodily
injury
;
and
his
dubiety
was
much
increased
when
,
on
arriving
at
the
Stone
-
pits
,
they
heard
the
mysterious
sound
of
the
loom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
it
is
as
I
thought
,
"
said
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
to
knock
loudly
before
Silas
heard
them
;
but
when
he
did
come
to
the
door
he
showed
no
impatience
,
as
he
would
once
have
done
,
at
a
visit
that
had
been
unasked
for
and
unexpected
.
<EOS>
Formerly
,
his
heart
had
been
as
a
locked
casket
with
its
treasure
inside
;
but
now
the
casket
was
empty
,
and
the
lock
was
broken
.
 
<EOS>
Left
groping
in
darkness
,
with
his
prop
utterly
gone
,
Silas
had
inevitably
a
sense
,
though
a
dull
and
half
-
despairing
one
,
that
if
any
help
came
to
him
it
must
come
from
without
;
and
there
was
a
slight
stirring
of
expectation
at
the
sight
of
his
fellow
-
men
,
a
faint
consciousness
of
dependence
on
their
goodwill
.
<EOS>
He
opened
the
door
wide
to
admit
Dolly
,
but
without
otherwise
returning
her
greeting
than
by
moving
the
armchair
a
few
inches
as
a
sign
that
she
was
to
sit
down
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
,
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
,
removed
the
white
cloth
that
covered
her
lard
-
cakes
,
and
said
in
her
gravest
way
    
<EOS>
"
I
'd
a
baking
<EOS>
yisterday
,
Master
Marner
,
and
the
lard
-
cakes
turned
out
better
nor
common
,
and
I
'd
ha
'
asked
you
to
accept
some
,
if
you
'd
thought
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
eat
such
things
myself
,
for
a
bit
o
<EOS>
'
bread
's
what
I
like
from
one
year
's
end
to
the
other
;
but
men
's
stomichs
are
made
so
comical
<EOS>
,
they
want
a
change
 
<EOS>
they
do
,
I
know
,
God
help
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
sighed
gently
as
she
held
out
the
cakes
to
Silas
,
who
thanked
her
kindly
and
looked
very
close
at
them
,
absently
,
being
accustomed
to
look
so
at
everything
he
took
into
his
hand
 
eyed
all
the
while
by
the
wondering
bright
orbs
of
the
small
Aaron
,
who
had
made
an
outwork
of
his
mother
's
chair
,
and
was
peeping
round
from
behind
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
letters
pricked
on
'
em
,
"
said
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
read
'em
myself
,
and
there
's
nobody
,
not
Mr.
Macey
himself
,
rightly
knows
what
they
mean
;
but
they
've
a
good
meaning
,
for
they
're
the
same
as
is
on
the
pulpit
-
cloth
at
church
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
they
,
Aaron
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
Aaron
retreated
completely
behind
his
outwork
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
go
,
that
's
naughty
,
"
said
his
mother
,
mildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
whativer
the
letters
are
,
they
've
a
good
meaning
;
and
it
's
a
stamp
as
has
been
in
our
house
,
Ben
says
,
ever
since
he
was
a
little
un
,
and
his
mother
used
to
put
it
on
the
cakes
,
and
I
've
allays
put
it
on
too
;
for
if
there
's
any
good
,
we
've
need
of
it
<EOS>
i
'
this
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
I.
H.
S.
,
"
said
Silas
,
at
which
proof
of
learning
Aaron
peeped
round
the
chair
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
you
can
read
'em
off
,
"
said
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ben
's
read
'em
to
me
many
and
many
a
time
,
but
they
slip
out
o
'
my
mind
again
;
the
more
's
the
pity
,
for
they
're
good
letters
,
else
they
would
n't
be
in
the
church
;
and
so
I
prick
'em
on
all
the
loaves
and
all
the
cakes
,
though
sometimes
they
wo
n't
hold
,
because
o
'
the
rising
 
for
,
as
I
said
,
if
there
's
any
good
to
be
got
<EOS>
we
've
need
of
it
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
this
world
 
<EOS>
that
we
have
;
<EOS>
and
I
hope
they
'll
bring
good
to
you
,
Master
Marner
,
for
it
's
wi
'
<EOS>
that
will
I
brought
you
the
cakes
;
and
you
see
the
letters
have
held
better
nor
common
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
was
as
unable
to
interpret
the
letters
as
Dolly
,
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
misunderstanding
the
desire
to
give
comfort
that
made
itself
heard
in
her
quiet
tones
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
with
more
feeling
than
before
 
"
Thank
you
 
thank
you
kindly
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
laid
down
the
cakes
and
seated
himself
absently
 
drearily
unconscious
of
any
distinct
benefit
towards
which
the
cakes
and
the
letters
,
or
even
Dolly
's
kindness
,
could
tend
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
if
there
's
good
anywhere
,
we
've
need
of
it
,
"
repeated
Dolly
,
who
did
not
lightly
forsake
a
serviceable
phrase
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
at
Silas
pityingly
as
she
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
did
n't
hear
the
church
-
bells
this
morning
,
Master
Marner
?
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
you
did
n't
know
it
was
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
Living
so
lone
here
<EOS>
,
you
lose
your
count
,
I
daresay
;
and
then
,
when
your
loom
makes
a
noise
,
you
ca
n't
hear
the
bells
,
more
partic'lar
now
the
frost
kills
the
sound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
did
;
I
heard
'
em
,
"
said
Silas
,
to
whom
Sunday
bells
were
a
mere
accident
of
the
day
,
and
not
part
of
its
sacredness
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
bells
in
Lantern
Yard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
heart
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Dolly
,
pausing
before
she
spoke
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
a
pity
it
is
you
should
work
of
a
Sunday
,
and
not
clean
yourself
 
if
you
_
did
n't
_
go
to
church
;
for
if
you
'd
a
roasting
bit
,
it
might
be
as
you
could
n't
leave
it
,
being
a
lone
man

<EOS>
But
there
's
the
bakehus

if
you
could
make
up
your
mind
to
spend
a
twopence
on
the
oven
now

then
,
 
not
every

in

I
should
n't

do
that
myself

<EOS>
you
might
carry
your

dinner
there

for
it
's
nothing

right
to
have
a
bit
o

hot
of
a
Sunday

not
to
make
it

go
to

and
see
the
holly
and
the
yew

and
hear
the
anthim

then

you

be

"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
's
exhortation
,
which
was
an
unusually
long
effort
of
speech
for
her
,
was
uttered
in
the
soothing
persuasive
tone
with
which
she
would
have
tried
to
prevail
on
a
sick
man
to
take
his
medicine
,
or
a
basin
of
gruel
for
which
he
had
no
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
had
never
before
been
closely
urged
on
the
point
of
his
absence
from
church
,
which
had
only
been
thought
of
as
a
part
of
his
general
queerness
;
and
he
was
too
direct
and
simple
to
evade
Dolly
's
appeal
.

Nay
,
nay
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
know
nothing
o
'
church
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
never
been
to
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Dolly
,
in
a
low
tone
of
wonderment
.
 
<EOS>
Then
bethinking
herself
of
Silas
's
advent
from
an
unknown
country
,
she
said
,
"
Could
it
ha
'
been
as
they
'd
no
church
where
you
was
born
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Silas
,
meditatively
,
sitting
in
his
usual
posture
of
leaning
on
his
knees
,
and
supporting
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
churches
 
a
many
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
big
town
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
knew
nothing
of
'em
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
chapel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
was
much
puzzled
at
this
new
word
,
but
she
was
rather
afraid
of
inquiring
further
<EOS>
,
lest
"
chapel
"
might
mean
some
haunt
of
wickedness
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
thought
,
she
said
    
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Master
Marner
,
it
's
niver
too
late
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
,
and
if
you
've
niver
had
no
church
,
there
's
no
telling
the
good
<EOS>
it
'll
do
you
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
feel
so
set
up
and
comfortable
as
niver
was
,
when
I
've
been
and
heard
the
prayers
,
and
the
singing
to
the
praise
and
glory
o
'
God
,
as
Mr.
Macey
gives
out
 
and
Mr.
Crackenthorp
saying
good
words
,
and
more
partic'lar
on
Sacramen
'
Day
;
and
if
a
bit
o
'
trouble
comes
,
I
feel
as
I
can
put
up
wi
'
it
,
for
I
've
looked
for
help
<EOS>
i
'
the
right
quarter
,
and
gev
myself
up
to
Them
as
we
must
all
give
ourselves
up
to
at
the
last
;
and
if
we'n
done
our
part
,
it
is
n't
to
be
believed
as
Them
as
are
above
us
'
ull
<EOS>
be
worse
nor
we

come

Their'n

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Dolly
's
exposition
of
her
simple
Raveloe
theology
fell
rather
unmeaningly
on
Silas
's
ears
,
for
there
was
no
word
in
it
that
could
rouse
a
memory
of
what
he
had
known
as
religion
,
and
his
comprehension
was
quite
baffled
by
the
plural
pronoun
,
which
was
no
heresy
of
Dolly
's
,
but
only
her
way
of
avoiding
a
presumptuous
familiarity
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
silent
,
not
feeling
inclined
to
assent
to
the
part
of
Dolly
's
speech
which
he
fully
understood
 
her
recommendation
that
he
should
go
to
church
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Silas
was
so
unaccustomed
to
talk
beyond
the
brief
questions
and
answers
necessary
for
the
transaction
of
his
simple
business
,
that
words
did
not
easily
come
to
him
without
the
urgency
of
a
distinct
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
,
little
Aaron
,
having
become
used
to
the
weaver
's
awful
presence
,
had
advanced
to
his
mother
's
side
,
and
<EOS>
Silas
,
seeming
to
notice
him
for
the
first
time
,
tried
to
return
Dolly
's
signs
of
good
-
will
by
offering
the
lad
a
bit
of
lard
-
cake
.
 
<EOS>
Aaron
shrank
back
a
little
,
and
rubbed
his
head
against
his
mother
's
shoulder
,
but
still
thought
the
piece
of
cake
worth
the
risk
of
putting
his
hand
out
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
for
shame
,
Aaron
,
"
said
his
mother
,
taking
him
on
her
lap
,
however
<EOS>
;
"
why
,
you
do
n't
want
cake
again
yet
awhile
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
wonderful
hearty
,
"
she
went
on
,
with
a
little
sigh
 
"
<EOS>
that
he
is
,
God
knows
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
my
youngest
,
and
we
spoil
him
sadly
,
for
either
me
or
the
father
<EOS>
must
allays
hev
him
in
our
sight
 
that
we
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stroked
Aaron
's
brown
head
,
and
thought
it
must
do
Master
Marner
good
to
see
such
a
"
pictur
of
a
child
"
.
 
<EOS>
But
Marner
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
,
saw
the
neat
-
featured
rosy
face
as
a
mere
dim
round
,
with
two
dark
spots
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
's
got
a
voice
like
a
bird
 
<EOS>
you
would
n't
think
,
"
Dolly
went
on
;
"
he
can
sing
a
Christmas
carril
as
his
father
's
taught
him
;
and
I
take
it
for
a
token
as
he
'll
come
to
good
,
as
he
can
learn
the
good
tunes
so
quick
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Aaron
,
stan
'
up
and
sing
the
carril
to
Master
Marner
,
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Aaron
replied
by
rubbing
his
forehead
against
his
mother
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
's
naughty
,
"
said
Dolly
,
gently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stan
'
up
,
when
mother
tells
you
,
and
let
me
hold
the
cake
till
you
've
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
Aaron
was
not
indisposed
to
display
his
talents
,
even
to
an
ogre
,
under
protecting
circumstances
;
and
after
a
few
more
signs
of
coyness
,
consisting
chiefly
in
rubbing
the
backs
of
his
hands
over
his
eyes
,
and
then
peeping
between
them
at
Master
Marner
,
to
see
if
he
looked
anxious
for
the
"
carril
"
,
he
at
length
allowed
his
head
to
be
duly
adjusted
,
and
standing
behind
the
table
,
which
let
him
appear
above
it
only
as
far
as
his
broad
frill
,
so
that
he
looked
like
a
cherubic
head
untroubled
with
a
body
,
he
began
with
a
clear
chirp
,
and
in
a
melody
that
had
the
rhythm
of
an
industrious
hammer
    
<EOS>
"
God
rest
you
,
merry
gentlemen
,
  
<EOS>
Let
nothing
you
dismay
,
  
For
Jesus
Christ
our
Savior
  
Was
born
on
Christmas
-
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dolly
listened
with
a
devout
look
,
glancing
at
Marner
in
some
confidence
that
this
strain
would
help
to
allure
him
to
church
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
Christmas
music
,
"
she
said
,
when
Aaron
had
ended
,
and
had
secured
his
piece
of
cake
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
other
music
equil
to
the
Christmas
music
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
the
erol
angils
sing
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
you
may
judge
what
it
is
at
church
,
Master
Marner
,
with
the
bassoon
and
the
voices
,
as
you
ca
n't
help
thinking
you
've
got
to
a
better
place
<EOS>
a'ready
 
<EOS>
for
I
would
n't
speak
ill
o
'
<EOS>
this
world
,
seeing
as
Them
put
us
in
it
as
knows
best
 
<EOS>
but
what
wi
'
the
drink
,
and
the
quarrelling
,
and
the
bad
illnesses
,
and
the
hard
dying
,
<EOS>
as
I
've
seen
times
and
times
,
one
's
thankful
to
hear
of
a
better
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
sings
pretty
,
do
n't
he
,
Master
Marner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Silas
,
absently
,
"
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Christmas
carol
,
with
its
hammer
-
like
rhythm
,
had
fallen
on
his
ears
as
strange
music
,
quite
unlike
a
hymn
,
and
could
have
none
of
the
effect
Dolly
contemplated
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
wanted
to
show
her
that
he
was
grateful
,
and
the
only
mode
that
occurred
to
him
was
to
offer
Aaron
a
bit
more
cake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
thank
you
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
Dolly
,
holding
down
Aaron
's
willing
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
be
going
home
now
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
wish
you
good
-
bye
,
Master
Marner
;
and
if
you
ever
feel
anyways
bad
in
your
inside
,
as
you
ca
n't
fend
for
yourself
,
I
'll
come
and
clean
up
for
you
,
and
get
you
a
bit
o
'
victual
,
and
willing
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
beg
and
pray
of
you
to
leave
off
weaving
of
a
Sunday
,
for
it
's
bad
for
soul
and
body
 
and
the
money
as
comes
i
'
that
way
'
ull
be
a
bad
bed
to
lie
down
on
at
the
last
,
if
it
does
n't
fly
away
,
nobody
knows
where
,
like
the
white
frost
.
<EOS>
And
you
'll
excuse
me
being
that
free
with
you
,
Master
Marner
<EOS>
,
for
I
wish
you
<EOS>
well
 
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
Make
your
bow
,
Aaron
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
said
"
Good
-
bye
,
and
thank
you
kindly
,
"
as
he
opened
the
door
for
Dolly
,
but
he
could
n't
help
feeling
relieved
when
she
was
gone
 
relieved
that
he
might
weave
again
and
moan
at
his
ease
.
 
<EOS>
Her
simple
view
of
life
and
its
comforts
,
by
which
she
had
tried
to
cheer
him
,
was
only
like
a
report
of
unknown
objects
,
which
his
imagination
could
not
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
The
fountains
of
human
love
and
of
faith
in
a
divine
love
had
not
yet
been
unlocked
,
and
his
soul
was
still
the
shrunken
rivulet
,
with
only
this
difference
,
that
its
little
groove
of
sand
was
blocked
up
,
and
it
wandered
confusedly
against
dark
obstruction
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
notwithstanding
the
honest
persuasions
of
Mr.
Macey
and
Dolly
Winthrop
,
Silas
spent
his
Christmas
-
day
in
loneliness
,
eating
his
meat
in
sadness
of
heart
,
though
the
meat
had
come
to
him
as
a
neighbourly
present
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
he
looked
out
on
the
black
frost
that
seemed
to
press
cruelly
on
every
blade
of
grass
,
while
the
half
-
icy
red
pool
shivered
under
the
bitter
wind
;
but
towards
evening
the
snow
began
to
fall
,
and
curtained
from
him
even
that
dreary
outlook
,
shutting
him
close
up
with
his
narrow
grief
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
sat
in
his
robbed
home
through
the
livelong
evening
,
not
caring
to
close
his
shutters
or
lock
his
door
,
pressing
his
head
between
his
hands
and
moaning
,
till
the
cold
grasped
him
and
told
him
that
his
fire
was
grey
.
  
<EOS>
Nobody
in
this
world
but
himself
knew
that
he
was
the
same
Silas
Marner
who
had
once
loved
his
fellow
with
tender
love
,
and
trusted
in
an
unseen
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
Even
to
himself
that
past
experience
had
become
dim
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
Raveloe
village
the
bells
rang
merrily
,
and
the
church
was
fuller
than
all
through
the
rest
of
the
year
,
with
red
faces
among
the
abundant
dark
-
green
boughs
 
faces
prepared
for
a
longer
service
than
usual
by
an
odorous
breakfast
of
toast
and
ale
.
 
<EOS>
Those
green
boughs
,
the
hymn
and
anthem
never
heard
but
at
Christmas
 
even
the
Athanasian
Creed
,
which
was
discriminated
from
the
others
only
as
being
longer
and
of
exceptional
virtue
,
since
it
was
only
read
on
rare
occasions
 
brought
a
vague
exulting
sense
,
<EOS>
for
which
the
grown
men
could
as
little
have
found
words
as
the
children
,
that
something
great
and
mysterious
had
been
done
for
them
in
heaven
above
and
in
earth
below
,
which
they
were
appropriating
by
their
presence
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
the
red
faces
made
their
way
through
the
black
biting
frost
to
their
own
homes
,
feeling
themselves
free
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
eat
,
drink
,
and
be
merry
,
and
using
that
Christian
freedom
without
diffidence
.
  
<EOS>
At
Squire
Cass
's
family
party
that
day
nobody
mentioned
Dunstan
 
<EOS>
nobody
was
sorry
for
his
absence
,
or
feared
it
would
be
too
long
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
and
his
wife
,
uncle
and
aunt
Kimble
,
were
there
,
and
the
annual
Christmas
talk
was
carried
through
without
any
omissions
,
rising
to
the
climax
of
Mr.
Kimble
's
experience
when
he
walked
the
London
hospitals
thirty
years
back
,
together
with
striking
professional
anecdotes
then
gathered
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
cards
followed
,
with
aunt
Kimble
's
annual
failure
to
follow
suit
,
and
uncle
Kimble
's
irascibility
concerning
the
odd
trick
which
was
rarely
explicable
to
him
,
when
it
was
not
on
his
side
,
without
a
general
visitation
of
tricks
to
see
that
they
were
formed
on
sound
principles
:
the
whole
being
accompanied
by
a
strong
steaming
odour
of
spirits
-
and
-
water
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
party
on
Christmas
-
day
,
being
a
strictly
family
party
,
was
not
the
pre
-
eminently
brilliant
celebration
of
the
season
at
the
Red
House
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
great
dance
on
New
Year
's
Eve
that
made
the
glory
of
Squire
Cass
's
hospitality
,
as
of
his
forefathers
'
,
time
out
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
occasion
when
all
the
society
of
Raveloe
and
Tarley
,
whether
old
acquaintances
separated
by
long
rutty
distances
,
or
cooled
acquaintances
separated
by
misunderstandings
concerning
runaway
calves
,
or
acquaintances
founded
on
intermittent
condescension
,
counted
on
meeting
and
on
comporting
themselves
with
mutual
appropriateness
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
occasion
on
which
fair
dames
who
came
on
pillions
sent
their
bandboxes
before
them
,
supplied
with
more
than
their
evening
costume
;
for
the
feast
was
not
to
end
with
a
single
evening
,
like
a
paltry
town
entertainment
,
where
the
whole
supply
of
eatables
is
put
on
the
table
at
once
,
and
bedding
is
scanty
.
 
<EOS>
The
Red
House
was
provisioned
as
if
for
a
siege
;
and
as
for
the
spare
feather
-
beds
ready
to
be
laid
on
floors
,
they
were
as
plentiful
as
might
naturally
be
expected
in
a
family
that
had
killed
its
own
geese
for
many
generations
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
Cass
was
looking
forward
to
this
New
Year
's
Eve
with
a
foolish
reckless
longing
,
that
made
him
half
deaf
to
his
importunate
companion
,
Anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dunsey
will
be
coming
home
soon
:
there
will
be
a
great
blow
-
up
,
and
how
will
you
bribe
his
spite
to
silence
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
wo
n't
come
home
before
New
Year
's
Eve
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Godfrey
;
"
and
I
shall
sit
by
Nancy
then
,
and
dance
with
her
,
and
get
a
kind
look
from
her
in
spite
of
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
money
is
wanted
in
another
quarter
,
"
said
Anxiety
,
in
a
louder
voice
,
"
and
how
will
you
get
it
without
selling
your
mother
's
diamond
pin
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
do
n't
get
it
...
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
something
may
happen
to
make
things
easier
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
there
's
one
pleasure
for
me
close
at
hand
:
Nancy
is
coming
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
suppose
your
father
should
bring
matters
to
a
pass
that
will
oblige
you
to
decline
marrying
her
 
and
to
give
your
reasons
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
and
do
n't
worry
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
Nancy
's
eyes
,
just
as
they
will
look
at
me
,
and
feel
her
hand
in
mine
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Anxiety
went
on
,
though
in
noisy
Christmas
company
;
refusing
to
be
utterly
quieted
even
by
much
drinking
.
    
<EOS>
Some
women
,
I
grant
,
would
not
appear
to
advantage
seated
on
a
pillion
,
and
attired
in
a
drab
joseph
and
a
drab
beaver
-
bonnet
,
with
a
crown
resembling
a
small
stew
-
pan
;
for
a
garment
suggesting
a
coachman
's
greatcoat
,
cut
out
under
an
exiguity
of
cloth
that
would
only
allow
of
miniature
capes
,
is
not
well
adapted
to
conceal
deficiencies
of
contour
,
nor
is
drab
a
colour
that
will
throw
sallow
cheeks
into
lively
contrast
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
the
greater
triumph
to
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
's
beauty
that
she
looked
thoroughly
bewitching
in
that
costume
,
as
,
seated
on
the
pillion
behind
her
tall
,
erect
father
<EOS>
,
she
held
one
arm
round
him
,
and
looked
down
,
with
open
-
eyed
anxiety
,
at
the
treacherous
snow
-
covered
pools
and
puddles
,
which
sent
up
formidable
splashings
of
mud
under
the
stamp
of
Dobbin
's
foot
.
 
<EOS>
A
painter
would
,
perhaps
,
have
preferred
her
in
those
moments
when
she
was
free
from
self
-
consciousness
;
but
certainly
the
bloom
on
her
cheeks
was
at
its
highest
point
of
contrast
with
the
surrounding
drab
when
she
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
Red
House
,
and
saw
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
ready
to
lift
her
from
the
pillion
.
 
<EOS>
She
wished
her
sister
Priscilla
had
come
up
at
the
same
time
behind
the
servant
,
for
then
she
would
have
contrived
that
Mr.
Godfrey
should
have
lifted
off
Priscilla
first
,
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
she
would
have
persuaded
her
father
to
go
round
to
the
horse
-
block
instead
of
alighting
at
the
door
-
steps
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
painful
,
when
you
had
made
it
quite
clear
to
a
young
man
that
you
were
determined
not
to
marry
him
,
however
much
he
might
wish
it
,
that
he
would
still
continue
to
pay
you
marked
attentions
;
besides
,
why
did
n't
he
always
show
the
same
attentions
,
if
he
meant
them
sincerely
,
instead
of
being
so
strange
as
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
was
,
sometimes
behaving
as
if
he
did
n't
want
to
speak
to
her
,
and
taking
no
notice
of
her
for
weeks
and
weeks
,
and
then
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
almost
making
love
again
?
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
was
quite
plain
he
had
no
real
love
for
her
,
else
he
would
not
let
people
have
_
that
_
to
say
of
him
which
they
did
say
.
<EOS>
Did
he
suppose
that
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
was
to
be
won
by
any
man
,
squire
or
no
squire
,
who
led
a
bad
life
?
 
<EOS>
That
was
not
what
she
had
been
used
to
see
in
her
own
father
,
who
was
the
soberest
and
best
man
in
that
country
-
side
,
<EOS>
only
a
little
hot
and
hasty
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
things
were
not
done
to
the
minute
.
  
<EOS>
All
these
thoughts
rushed
through
Miss
Nancy
's
mind
,
in
their
habitual
succession
,
in
the
moments
between
her
first
sight
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
standing
at
the
door
and
her
own
arrival
there
.
<EOS>
Happily
,
the
Squire
came
out
too
and
gave
a
loud
greeting
to
her
father
,
so
that
,
somehow
,
under
cover
of
this
noise
she
seemed
to
find
concealment
for
her
confusion
and
neglect
of
any
suitably
formal
behaviour
,
while
she
was
being
lifted
from
the
pillion
by
strong
arms
which
seemed
to
find
her
ridiculously
small
and
light
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
the
best
reason
for
hastening
into
the
house
at
once
,
since
the
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
again
,
threatening
an
unpleasant
journey
for
such
guests
as
were
still
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
a
small
minority
;
for
already
the
afternoon
was
beginning
to
decline
,
and
there
would
not
be
too
much
time
for
the
ladies
who
came
from
a
distance
to
attire
themselves
in
readiness
for
the
early
tea
which
was
to
inspirit
them
for
the
dance
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
buzz
of
voices
through
the
house
,
as
Miss
Nancy
entered
,
mingled
with
the
scrape
of
a
fiddle
preluding
in
the
kitchen
;
but
the
Lammeters
were
guests
whose
arrival
had
evidently
been
thought
of
so
much
that
it
had
been
watched
for
from
the
windows
,
for
Mrs.
Kimble
,
who
did
the
honours
at
the
Red
House
on
these
great
occasions
,
came
forward
to
meet
Miss
Nancy
in
the
hall
,
and
conduct
her
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Kimble
was
the
Squire
's
sister
,
as
well
as
the
doctor
's
wife
 
a
double
dignity
,
with
which
her
diameter
was
in
direct
proportion
;
so
that
,
a
journey
up
-
stairs
being
rather
fatiguing
to
her
<EOS>
,
she
did
not
oppose
Miss
Nancy
's
request
to
be
allowed
to
find
her
way
alone
to
the
Blue
Room
,
where
the
Miss
Lammeters
'
bandboxes
had
been
deposited
on
their
arrival
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
hardly
a
bedroom
in
the
house
where
feminine
compliments
were
not
passing
and
feminine
toilettes
going
forward
,
in
various
stages
,
in
space
made
scanty
by
extra
beds
spread
upon
the
floor
;
and
Miss
Nancy
,
as
she
entered
the
Blue
Room
,
had
to
make
her
little
formal
curtsy
to
a
group
of
six
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
one
hand
,
there
were
ladies
no
less
important
than
the
two
Miss
Gunns
,
the
wine
merchant
's
daughters
from
Lytherly
,
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
,
with
the
tightest
skirts
and
the
shortest
waists
,
and
gazed
at
by
Miss
Ladbrook
(
of
the
Old
Pastures
)
with
a
shyness
not
unsustained
by
inward
criticism
.
 
<EOS>
Partly
,
Miss
Ladbrook
felt
that
her
own
skirt
must
be
regarded
as
unduly
lax
by
the
Miss
Gunns
,
and
partly
,
that
it
was
a
pity
the
Miss
Gunns
did
not
show
that
judgment
which
she
herself
would
show
if
she
were
in
their
place
,
by
stopping
a
little
on
this
side
of
the
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
Mrs.
Ladbrook
was
standing
in
skull
-
cap
and
front
,
with
her
turban
in
her
hand
,
curtsying
and
smiling
blandly
and
saying
,
"
After
you
,
ma'am
,
"
to
another
lady
in
similar
circumstances
,
who
had
politely
offered
the
precedence
at
the
looking
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
But
Miss
Nancy
had
no
sooner
made
her
curtsy
than
an
elderly
lady
came
forward
,
whose
full
white
muslin
kerchief
,
and
mob
-
cap
round
her
curls
of
smooth
grey
hair
,
were
in
daring
contrast
with
the
puffed
yellow
satins
and
top
-
knotted
caps
of
her
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
She
approached
Miss
Nancy
with
much
primness
,
and
said
,
with
a
slow
,
treble
suavity
    
"
Niece
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
see
you
well
in
health
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
kissed
her
aunt
's
cheek
dutifully
,
and
answered
,
with
the
same
sort
of
amiable
primness
,
"
Quite
well
,
I
thank
you
,
aunt
;
and
I
hope
I
see
you
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
niece
;
I
keep
my
health
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
is
my
brother
-
in
-
law
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
These
dutiful
questions
and
answers
were
continued
until
it
was
ascertained
in
detail
that
the
Lammeters
were
all
as
well
as
usual
,
and
the
Osgoods
likewise
,
also
that
niece
Priscilla
must
certainly
arrive
shortly
,
and
that
travelling
on
pillions
in
snowy
weather
was
unpleasant
,
though
a
joseph
was
a
great
protection
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Nancy
was
formally
introduced
to
her
aunt
's
visitors
,
the
Miss
Gunns
,
as
being
the
daughters
of
a
mother
known
to
_
their
_
mother
,
though
now
for
the
first
time
induced
to
make
a
journey
into
these
parts
;
and
these
ladies
were
so
taken
by
surprise
at
finding
such
a
lovely
face
and
figure
in
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
country
place
,
that
they
began
to
feel
some
curiosity
about
the
dress
she
would
put
on
when
she
took
off
her
joseph
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
,
whose
thoughts
were
always
conducted
with
the
propriety
and
moderation
conspicuous
in
her
manners
,
remarked
to
herself
that
the
Miss
Gunns
were
rather
hard
-
featured
than
otherwise
,
and
that
such
very
low
dresses
as
they
wore
might
have
been
attributed
to
vanity
if
their
shoulders
had
been
pretty
,
but
that
,
being
as
they
were
,
it
was
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
showed
their
necks
from
a
love
of
display
,
but
rather
from
some
obligation
not
inconsistent
with
sense
and
modesty
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
convinced
,
as
she
opened
her
box
,
that
this
must
be
her
aunt
Osgood
's
opinion
,
for
Miss
Nancy
's
mind
resembled
her
aunt
's
to
a
degree
that
everybody
said
was
surprising
,
considering
the
kinship
was
on
Mr.
Osgood
's
side
;
and
though
you
might
not
have
supposed
it
from
the
formality
of
their
greeting
,
there
was
a
devoted
attachment
and
mutual
admiration
between
aunt
and
niece
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Miss
Nancy
's
refusal
of
her
cousin
Gilbert
Osgood
(
on
the
ground
solely
that
he
was
her
cousin
)
,
though
it
had
grieved
her
aunt
greatly
,
had
not
in
the
least
cooled
the
preference
which
had
determined
her
to
leave
Nancy
several
of
her
hereditary
ornaments
,
let
Gilbert
's
future
wife
be
whom
she
might
.
  
<EOS>
Three
of
the
ladies
quickly
retired
,
but
the
Miss
Gunns
were
quite
content
that
Mrs.
Osgood
's
inclination
to
remain
with
her
niece
gave
them
also
a
reason
for
staying
to
see
the
rustic
beauty
's
toilette
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
really
a
pleasure
 
from
the
first
opening
of
the
bandbox
,
where
everything
smelt
of
lavender
and
rose
-
leaves
,
to
the
clasping
of
the
small
coral
necklace
that
fitted
closely
round
her
little
white
neck
.
<EOS>
Everything
belonging
to
Miss
Nancy
was
of
delicate
purity
and
nattiness
:
not
a
crease
was
where
it
had
no
business
to
be
,
not
a
bit
of
her
linen
professed
whiteness
without
fulfilling
its
profession
;
the
very
pins
on
her
pincushion
were
stuck
in
after
a
pattern
from
which
she
was
careful
to
allow
no
aberration
;
and
as
for
her
own
person
,
it
gave
the
same
idea
of
perfect
unvarying
neatness
as
the
body
of
a
little
bird
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
her
light
-
brown
hair
was
cropped
behind
like
a
boy
's
,
and
was
dressed
in
front
in
a
number
of
flat
rings
,
that
lay
quite
away
from
her
face
;
but
there
was
no
sort
of
coiffure
that
could
make
Miss
Nancy
's
cheek
and
neck
look
otherwise
than
pretty
;
and
when
at
last
she
stood
complete
in
her
silvery
twilled
silk
,
her
lace
tucker
,
her
coral
necklace
,
and
coral
ear
-
drops
,
the
Miss
Gunns
could
see
nothing
to
criticise
except
her
hands
,
which
bore
the
traces
of
butter
-
making
,
cheese
-
crushing
,
and
even
still
coarser
work
.
 
<EOS>
But
Miss
Nancy
was
not
ashamed
of
that
,
for
even
while
she
was
dressing
she
narrated
to
her
aunt
<EOS>
how
she
and
Priscilla
had
packed
their
boxes
yesterday
,
because
this
morning
was
baking
morning
,
and
since
they
were
leaving
home
,
it
was
desirable
to
make
a
good
supply
of
meat
-
pies
for
the
kitchen
;
and
as
she
concluded
this
judicious
remark
,
she
turned
to
the
Miss
Gunns
that
she
might
not
commit
the
rudeness
of
not
including
them
in
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
The
Miss
Gunns
smiled
stiffly
,
and
thought
what
a
pity
it
was
that
these
rich
country
people
,
who
could
afford
to
buy
such
good
clothes
(
really
Miss
Nancy
's
lace
and
silk
were
very
costly
)
,
should
be
brought
up
in
utter
ignorance
and
vulgarity
.
 
<EOS>
She
actually
said
"
mate
"
for
"
meat
"
,
"
'
appen
"
for
"
perhaps
"
,
and
"
oss
"
for
"
horse
"
,
which
,
to
young
ladies
living
in
good
Lytherly
society
,
who
habitually
said
'
orse
,
even
in
domestic
privacy
,
and
<EOS>
only
said
'
appen
on
the
right
occasions
,
was
necessarily
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
,
indeed
,
had
never
been
to
any
school
higher
than
<EOS>
Dame
Tedman
's
:
her
acquaintance
with
profane
literature
hardly
went
beyond
the
rhymes
she
had
worked
in
her
large
sampler
under
the
lamb
and
the
shepherdess
;
and
in
order
to
balance
an
account
,
she
was
obliged
to
effect
her
subtraction
by
removing
visible
metallic
shillings
and
sixpences
from
a
visible
metallic
total
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
hardly
a
servant
-
maid
in
these
days
who
is
not
better
informed
than
Miss
Nancy
;
yet
she
had
the
essential
attributes
of
a
lady
 
high
veracity
,
delicate
honour
in
her
dealings
,
deference
to
others
,
and
refined
personal
habits
,
 
and
lest
these
should
not
suffice
to
convince
grammatical
fair
ones
that
her
feelings
can
at
all
resemble
theirs
,
I
will
add
that
she
was
slightly
proud
and
exacting
,
and
as
constant
in
her
affection
towards
a
baseless
opinion
as
towards
an
erring
lover
.
  
<EOS>
The
anxiety
about
sister
Priscilla
,
which
had
grown
rather
active
by
the
time
the
coral
necklace
was
clasped
,
was
happily
ended
by
the
entrance
of
that
cheerful
-
looking
lady
herself
,
with
a
face
made
blowsy
by
cold
and
damp
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
first
questions
and
greetings
,
she
turned
to
Nancy
,
and
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
 
then
wheeled
her
round
,
to
ascertain
that
the
back
view
was
equally
faultless
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
o
'
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
these
_
gowns
,
aunt
Osgood
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Priscilla
,
while
Nancy
helped
her
to
unrobe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
handsome
indeed
,
niece
,
"
said
Mrs.
Osgood
,
with
a
slight
increase
of
formality
.
 
<EOS>
She
always
thought
niece
Priscilla
too
rough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
obliged
to
have
the
same
as
Nancy
,
you
know
,
for
all
I
'm
five
years
older
,
and
it
makes
me
look
yallow
;
for
she
never
_
will
_
have
anything
without
I
have
mine
just
like
it
,
because
she
wants
us
to
look
like
sisters
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
tell
her
,
folks
'
ull
think
it
's
my
weakness
makes
me
fancy
as
I
shall
look
pretty
in
what
she
looks
pretty
in
.
 
<EOS>
For
<EOS>
I
_
am
_
<EOS>
ugly
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
denying
<EOS>
that
:
I
feature
my
father
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
law
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
,
do
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
Priscilla
here
turned
to
the
Miss
Gunns
,
rattling
on
in
too
much
preoccupation
with
the
delight
of
talking
,
to
notice
that
her
candour
was
not
appreciated
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
pretty
uns
do
for
fly
-
catchers
 
<EOS>
they
keep
the
men
off
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
no
opinion
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
men
,
Miss
Gunn
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
_
you
_
have
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
for
fretting
and
stewing
about
what
_
they_'ll
think
of
you
from
morning
till
night
,
and
making
your
life
uneasy
about
what
they
're
doing
when
they
're
out
o
'
<EOS>
your
sight
 
as
I
tell
Nancy
<EOS>
,
it
's
a
folly
<EOS>
no
woman
need
be
guilty
of
,
<EOS>
if
she
's
got
a
good
father
and
a
good
home
:
let
her
leave
it
to
them
as
have
got
no
fortin
,
and
ca
n't
help
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
say
,
Mr.
Have
-
your
-
own
-
way
is
the
best
husband
,
and
the
only
one
I
'd
ever
promise
to
obey
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
n't
pleasant
,
when
you
've
been
used
to
living
in
a
big
way
,
and
managing
hogsheads
and
all
that
,
to
go
and
put
your
nose
in
by
somebody
else
's
fireside
,
or
to
sit
down
by
yourself
to
a
scrag
or
a
knuckle
;
<EOS>
but
,
thank
God
!
 
<EOS>
my
father
's
a
sober
man
and
likely
to
live
;
<EOS>
and
if
you
've
got
a
man
by
the
chimney
-
corner
,
it
does
n't
matter
if
he
's
childish
 
<EOS>
the
business
need
n't
be
broke
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
delicate
process
of
getting
her
narrow
gown
over
her
head
without
injury
to
her
smooth
curls
,
obliged
Miss
Priscilla
to
pause
in
this
rapid
survey
of
life
,
and
Mrs.
Osgood
seized
the
opportunity
of
rising
and
saying
    
"
Well
,
niece
,
you
'll
follow
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
Miss
Gunns
will
like
to
go
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sister
,
"
said
Nancy
,
when
they
were
alone
,
"
you
've
offended
the
Miss
Gunns
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
,
child
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Priscilla
,
in
some
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
asked
them
if
they
minded
about
being
ugly
 
<EOS>
you
're
so
very
blunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Law
,
did
I
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
it
popped
out
<EOS>
:
it
's
a
mercy
<EOS>
I
said
no
more
,
for
I
'm
a
bad
un
to
live
with
folks
when
they
do
n't
like
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
for
being
ugly
,
look
at
me
,
child
,
in
this
silver
-
coloured
silk
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
how
it
'
ud
be
 
<EOS>
I
look
as
yallow
as
a
daffadil
.
<EOS>
Anybody
'
ud
say
you
wanted
to
make
a
mawkin
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Priscy
,
do
n't
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
and
prayed
of
you
not
to
let
us
have
this
silk
if
you
'd
like
another
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
willing
to
have
_
<EOS>
your
_
choice
,
you
know
I
was
,
"
said
Nancy
,
in
anxious
self
-
vindication
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
child
!
 
<EOS>
you
know
you
'd
set
your
heart
on
this
;
and
reason
good
,
<EOS>
for
you
're
the
colour
o
'
cream
.
 
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
fine
doings
for
you
to
dress
yourself
to
suit
_
my
_
skin
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
find
fault
with
,
is
that
notion
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
yours
as
I
must
dress
myself
just
like
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
do
as
you
like
with
me
 
<EOS>
you
always
did
,
from
when
first
you
begun
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
wanted
to
go
the
field
's
length
,
the
field
's
length
you
'd
go
;
and
there
was
no
whipping
you
,
for
you
looked
as
prim
and
innicent
as
a
daisy
<EOS>
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Priscy
,
"
said
Nancy
,
gently
,
as
she
fastened
a
coral
necklace
,
exactly
like
her
own
,
round
Priscilla
's
neck
,
which
was
very
far
from
being
like
her
own
,
"
I
'm
sure
I
'm
willing
to
give
way
as
far
as
is
right
,
but
who
should
n't
dress
alike
if
it
is
n't
sisters
?
<EOS>
Would
you
have
us
go
about
looking
as
if
we
were
no
kin
to
one
another
 
us
that
have
got
no
mother
and
not
another
sister
in
the
world
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
do
what
was
right
,
if
I
dressed
in
a
gown
dyed
with
cheese
-
colouring
;
and
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
you
'd
choose
,
and
let
me
wear
what
pleases
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
go
again
!
 
<EOS>
You
'd
come
round
to
the
same
thing
if
one
talked
to
you
from
Saturday
night
till
Saturday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
'll
be
fine
fun
to
see
how
you
'll
master
your
husband
and
never
raise
your
voice
above
the
singing
o
'
<EOS>
the
kettle
all
the
while

<EOS>
I
like
to
see
the
men
mastered
!

"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
_
<EOS>
so
_
,
Priscy
,
"
said
Nancy
,
blushing
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
do
n't
mean
ever
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
never
mean
a
fiddlestick
's
end

"
 
<EOS>
said
Priscilla
,
as
she
arranged
her
discarded
dress
,
and
closed
her
bandbox
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
shall
_
I
_
have
to
work
for
when
father
's
gone
,
if
you
are
to
go
and
take
notions
in
your
head
and
be
an
old
maid
,
because
some
folks
are
no
better
than
they
should
be
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
a
bit
o
'
patience
with
you
 
sitting
on
an
addled
egg
for
ever
,
as
if
there
was
never
a
fresh
un
in
the
world

<EOS>
One
old
maid
's
enough
out
o

two
sisters
;
and
I
shall
do
credit
to
a
single
life
,
for
God
A'mighty
meant
me
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
we
can
go
down
now

<EOS>
I
'm
as
ready
as

_
can
_
be

's
nothing
awanting

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
two
Miss
Lammeters
walked
into
the
large
parlour
together
,
any
one
who
did
not
know
the
character
of
both
might
certainly
have
supposed
that
the
reason
why
the
square
-
shouldered
,
clumsy
,
high
-
featured
Priscilla
wore
a
dress
the
facsimile
of
her
pretty
sister
's
,
was
either
the
mistaken
vanity
of
the
one
,
or
the
malicious
contrivance
of
the
other
in
order
to
set
off
her
own
rare
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
good
-
natured
self
-
forgetful
cheeriness
and
common
-
sense
of
Priscilla
would
soon
have
dissipated
the
one
suspicion
;
and
the
modest
calm
of
Nancy
's
speech
and
manners
told
clearly
of
a
mind
free
from
all
disavowed
devices
.
  
<EOS>
Places
of
honour
had
been
kept
for
the
Miss
Lammeters
near
the
head
of
the
principal
tea
-
table
in
the
wainscoted
parlour
,
now
looking
fresh
and
pleasant
with
handsome
branches
of
holly
,
yew
,
and
laurel
,
from
the
abundant
growths
of
the
old
garden
;
and
Nancy
felt
an
inward
flutter
,
that
no
firmness
of
purpose
could
prevent
,
when
she
saw
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
advancing
to
lead
her
to
a
seat
between
himself
and
Mr.
Crackenthorp
,
while
Priscilla
was
called
to
the
opposite
side
between
her
father
and
the
Squire
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
did
make
some
difference
to
Nancy
that
the
lover
she
had
given
up
was
the
young
man
of
quite
the
highest
consequence
in
the
parish
 
at
home
in
a
venerable
and
unique
parlour
,
which
was
the
extremity
of
grandeur
in
her
experience
,
a
parlour
where
_
she
_
might
one
day
have
been
mistress
,
with
the
consciousness
that
she
was
spoken
of
as
"
Madam
Cass
"
,
the
Squire
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
These
circumstances
exalted
her
inward
drama
in
her
own
eyes
,
and
deepened
the
emphasis
with
which
she
declared
to
herself
that
not
the
most
dazzling
rank
should
induce
her
to
marry
a
man
whose
conduct
showed
him
careless
of
his
character
,
but
that
,
"
love
once
,
love
always
"
,
was
the
motto
of
a
true
and
pure
woman
,
and
no
man
should
ever
have
any
right
over
her
which
would
be
a
call
on
her
to
destroy
the
dried
flowers
that
she
treasured
,
and
always
would
treasure
,
for
Godfrey
Cass
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
And
Nancy
was
capable
of
keeping
her
word
to
herself
under
very
trying
conditions
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
but
<EOS>
a
becoming
blush
betrayed
the
moving
thoughts
that
urged
themselves
upon
her
as
she
accepted
the
seat
next
to
Mr.
Crackenthorp
;
for
she
was
so
instinctively
neat
and
adroit
in
all
her
actions
,
and
her
pretty
lips
met
each
other
with
such
quiet
firmness
,
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
her
to
appear
agitated
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
rector
's
practice
to
let
a
charming
blush
pass
without
an
appropriate
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
in
the
least
lofty
or
aristocratic
,
but
simply
a
merry
-
eyed
,
small
-
featured
,
grey
-
haired
man
,
with
his
chin
propped
by
an
ample
,
many
-
creased
white
neckcloth
which
seemed
to
predominate
over
every
other
point
in
his
person
,
and
somehow
to
impress
its
peculiar
character
on
his
remarks
;
<EOS>
so
that
to
have
considered
his
amenities
apart
from
his
cravat
would
have
been
a
severe
,
and
perhaps
a
dangerous
,
effort
of
abstraction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
Miss
Nancy
,
"
he
said
,
turning
his
head
within
his
cravat
and
smiling
down
pleasantly
upon
her
,
"
when
anybody
pretends
this
has
been
a
severe
winter
,
I
shall
tell
them
I
saw
the
roses
blooming
on
New
Year
's
Eve
 
<EOS>
eh
,
Godfrey
,
what
do
<EOS>
_
you
_
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
made
no
reply
,
and
avoided
looking
at
Nancy
very
markedly
;
for
though
these
complimentary
personalities
were
held
to
be
in
excellent
taste
in
old
-
fashioned
Raveloe
society
,
reverent
love
has
a
politeness
of
its
own
which
it
teaches
to
men
otherwise
of
small
schooling
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Squire
was
rather
impatient
at
<EOS>
Godfrey
's
showing
himself
a
dull
spark
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
advanced
hour
of
the
day
,
the
Squire
was
always
in
higher
spirits
than
we
have
seen
him
in
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
and
felt
it
quite
pleasant
to
fulfil
the
hereditary
duty
of
being
noisily
jovial
and
patronizing
:
the
large
silver
snuff
-
box
was
in
active
service
and
was
offered
without
fail
to
all
neighbours
from
time
to
time
,
however
often
they
might
have
declined
the
favour
.
 
<EOS>
At
present
,
the
Squire
had
only
given
an
express
welcome
to
the
heads
of
families
as
they
appeared
;
but
always
as
the
evening
deepened
,
his
hospitality
rayed
out
more
widely
,
till
he
had
tapped
the
youngest
guests
on
the
back
and
shown
a
peculiar
fondness
for
their
presence
,
in
the
full
belief
that
they
must
feel
their
lives
made
happy
by
their
belonging
to
a
parish
where
there
was
such
a
hearty
man
as
Squire
Cass
to
invite
them
and
wish
them
well
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
this
early
stage
of
the
jovial
mood
,
it
was
natural
that
he
should
wish
to
supply
his
son
's
deficiencies
by
looking
and
speaking
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
he
began
,
offering
his
snuff
-
box
to
Mr.
Lammeter
,
who
for
the
second
time
bowed
his
head
and
waved
his
hand
in
stiff
rejection
of
the
offer
,
"
us
old
fellows
may
wish
ourselves
young
to
-
night
,
when
we
see
the
mistletoe
-
bough
in
the
White
Parlour
.
<EOS>
It
's
true
,
most
things
are
gone
back'ard
in
these
last
thirty
years
 
the
country
's
going
down
since
the
old
king
fell
ill
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
look
at
Miss
Nancy
here
,
I
begin
to
think
the
lasses
keep
up
their
quality
;
 
ding
me
if
I
remember
a
sample
to
match
her
,
not
when
I
was
a
fine
young
fellow
,
and
thought
a
deal
about
my
pigtail
.
 
<EOS>
No
offence
to
you
,
madam
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
bending
to
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
,
who
sat
by
him
,
"
I
did
n't
know
_
<EOS>
you
_
when
you
were
as
young
as
Miss
Nancy
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
 
a
small
blinking
woman
,
who
fidgeted
incessantly
with
her
lace
,
ribbons
,
and
gold
chain
,
turning
her
head
about
and
making
subdued
noises
,
very
much
like
a
guinea
-
pig
that
twitches
its
nose
and
soliloquizes
in
all
company
indiscriminately
 
now
blinked
and
fidgeted
towards
the
Squire
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
 
no
offence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
emphatic
compliment
of
the
Squire
's
to
Nancy
was
felt
by
others
besides
Godfrey
to
have
a
diplomatic
significance
;
and
her
father
gave
a
slight
additional
erectness
to
his
back
,
as
he
looked
across
the
table
at
her
with
complacent
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
That
grave
and
orderly
senior
was
not
going
to
bate
a
jot
of
his
dignity
by
seeming
elated
at
the
notion
of
a
match
between
his
family
and
the
Squire
<EOS>
's
<EOS>
:
he
was
gratified
by
any
honour
paid
to
his
daughter
;
but
he
must
see
an
alteration
in
several
ways
before
his
consent
would
be
vouchsafed
.
<EOS>
His
spare
but
healthy
person
,
and
high
-
featured
firm
face
,
that
looked
as
if
it
had
never
been
flushed
by
excess
,
was
in
strong
contrast
,
not
only
with
the
Squire
's
,
but
with
the
appearance
of
the
Raveloe
farmers
generally
 
in
accordance
with
a
favourite
saying
of
his
own
,
that
"
breed
was
stronger
than
pasture
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
's
<EOS>
wonderful
like
what
her
mother
was
,
though
;
is
n't
she
,
Kimble
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
stout
lady
of
that
name
,
looking
round
for
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
But
Doctor
Kimble
(
country
apothecaries
in
old
days
enjoyed
that
title
without
authority
of
diploma
)
,
being
a
thin
and
agile
man
<EOS>
,
was
flitting
about
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
making
himself
agreeable
to
his
feminine
patients
,
with
medical
impartiality
,
and
being
welcomed
everywhere
as
a
doctor
by
<EOS>
hereditary
right
 
<EOS>
not
one
of
those
miserable
apothecaries
who
canvass
for
practice
in
strange
neighbourhoods
,
and
spend
all
their
income
in
starving
their
one
horse
,
but
a
man
of
substance
,
able
to
keep
an
extravagant
table
like
the
best
of
his
patients
.
 
<EOS>
Time
out
of
mind
<EOS>
the
Raveloe
doctor
had
been
a
Kimble
;
Kimble
was
inherently
a
doctor
's
name
;
and
it
was
difficult
to
contemplate
firmly
the
melancholy
fact
that
the
actual
Kimble
had
no
son
,
so
that
his
practice
might
one
day
be
handed
over
to
a
successor
with
the
incongruous
name
of
Taylor
or
Johnson
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
that
case
the
wiser
people
in
Raveloe
would
employ
Dr.
Blick
of
Flitton
 
as
less
unnatural
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
speak
to
me
,
my
dear
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
authentic
doctor
,
coming
quickly
to
his
wife
's
side
;
but
,
as
if
foreseeing
that
she
would
be
too
much
out
of
breath
to
repeat
her
remark
,
he
went
on
immediately
 
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
Miss
Priscilla
,
the
sight
of
you
revives
the
taste
of
that
super
-
excellent
pork
-
pie
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
batch
is
n't
near
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
it
is
,
doctor
,
"
said
Priscilla
;
"
but
I
'll
answer
for
it
the
next
shall
be
as
good
.
 
<EOS>
My
pork
-
pies
do
n't
turn
out
well
by
chance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
as
your
doctoring
does
,
eh
,
Kimble
?
 
<EOS>
because
folks
forget
to
take
your
physic
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
Squire
,
who
regarded
physic
and
doctors
as
many
loyal
churchmen
regard
the
church
and
the
clergy
 
tasting
a
joke
against
them
when
he
was
in
health
,
but
impatiently
eager
for
their
aid
when
anything
was
the
matter
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
tapped
his
box
,
and
looked
round
with
a
triumphant
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
she
has
a
quick
wit
,
my
friend
Priscilla
has
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
choosing
to
attribute
the
epigram
to
a
lady
rather
than
allow
a
brother
-
in
-
law
that
advantage
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
saves
a
little
pepper
to
sprinkle
over
her
talk
 
<EOS>
that
's
the
reason
why
she
never
puts
too
much
into
her
pies
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
my
wife
now
<EOS>
,
she
never
has
an
answer
at
her
tongue
's
end
;
but
if
I
offend
her
,
she
's
sure
to
scarify
my
throat
with
black
pepper
the
next
day
,
or
else
give
me
the
colic
with
watery
greens
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
an
awful
tit
-
for
-
tat
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
vivacious
doctor
made
a
pathetic
grimace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
hear
the
like
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Mrs.
Kimble
,
laughing
above
her
double
chin
with
much
good
-
humour
,
aside
to
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
,
who
blinked
and
nodded
,
and
seemed
to
intend
a
smile
,
which
,
by
the
correlation
of
forces
,
went
off
in
small
twitchings
and
noises
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
's
the
sort
of
tit
-
for
-
tat
adopted
in
your
profession
,
Kimble
,
if
you
've
a
grudge
against
a
patient
,
"
said
the
rector
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
do
have
a
grudge
against
our
patients
,
"
said
Mr.
Kimble
,
"
except
when
they
leave
us
:
and
then
,
you
see
,
we
have
n't
the
chance
of
prescribing
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
Miss
Nancy
,
"
he
continued
,
suddenly
skipping
to
Nancy
's
side
,
"
you
wo
n't
forget
your
promise
?
<EOS>
You
're
to
save
a
dance
for
me
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
come
,
Kimble
,
do
n't
you
be
too
for'ard
,
"
said
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
"
Give
the
young
uns
fair
-
play
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
my
son
Godfrey'll
be
wanting
to
have
a
round
with
you
if
you
run
off
with
Miss
Nancy
.
<EOS>
He
's
bespoke
her
for
the
first
dance
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
he
continued
,
throwing
himself
backward
,
and
looking
at
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
asked
Miss
Nancy
to
open
the
dance
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
sorely
uncomfortable
under
this
significant
insistence
about
Nancy
,
and
afraid
to
think
where
it
would
end
by
the
time
his
father
had
set
his
usual
hospitable
example
of
drinking
before
and
after
supper
,
saw
no
course
open
but
to
turn
to
Nancy
and
say
,
with
as
little
awkwardness
as
possible
    
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
've
not
asked
her
yet
,
but
I
hope
she
'll
consent
 
if
somebody
else
has
n't
been
before
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
've
not
engaged
myself
,
"
said
Nancy
,
quietly
,
though
blushingly
.
<EOS>
(
If
Mr.
Godfrey
founded
any
hopes
on
her
consenting
to
dance
with
him
,
he
would
soon
be
undeceived
;
but
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
be
uncivil
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
hope
you
've
no
objections
to
dancing
with
me
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
beginning
to
lose
the
sense
that
there
was
anything
uncomfortable
in
this
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
objections
,
"
said
Nancy
,
in
a
cold
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
well
,
you
're
a
lucky
fellow
,
Godfrey
,
"
said
uncle
Kimble
;
"
but
you
're
my
godson
,
so
I
wo
n't
stand
in
your
way
.
 
<EOS>
Else
<EOS>
I
'm
not
so
very
old
,
eh
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
he
went
on
,
skipping
to
his
wife
's
side
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
mind
my
having
a
second
after
you
were
gone
 
not
if
I
cried
a
good
deal
first
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
take
a
cup
o
'
tea
and
stop
your
tongue
,
do
,
"
said
good
-
humoured
Mrs.
Kimble
,
feeling
some
pride
in
a
husband
who
must
be
regarded
as
so
clever
and
amusing
by
the
company
generally
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
only
not
been
irritable
at
cards
!
  
<EOS>
While
safe
,
well
-
tested
personalities
were
enlivening
the
tea
in
this
way
,
the
sound
of
the
fiddle
approaching
within
a
distance
at
which
it
could
be
heard
distinctly
,
made
the
young
people
look
at
each
other
with
sympathetic
impatience
for
the
end
of
the
meal
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
's
Solomon
in
the
hall
,
"
said
the
Squire
,
"
and
playing
my
fav'rite
tune
,
_
<EOS>
I
_
believe
 
<EOS>
"
The
flaxen
-
headed
ploughboy
"
 
<EOS>
he
's
for
giving
us
a
hint
as
we
are
n't
enough
in
a
hurry
to
hear
him
play
.
<EOS>
Bob
,
"
he
called
out
to
his
third
long
-
legged
son
,
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
"
open
the
door
,
and
tell
Solomon
to
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
give
us
a
tune
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bob
obeyed
,
and
Solomon
walked
in
,
fiddling
as
he
walked
,
for
he
would
on
no
account
break
off
in
the
middle
of
a
tune
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Solomon
,
"
said
the
Squire
,
with
loud
patronage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Round
here
,
my
man
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
I
knew
it
was
"
The
flaxen
-
headed
ploughboy
"
:
there
's
no
finer
tune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Solomon
Macey
,
a
small
hale
old
man
with
an
abundant
crop
of
long
white
hair
reaching
nearly
to
his
shoulders
,
advanced
to
the
indicated
spot
,
bowing
reverently
while
he
fiddled
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
respected
the
company
,
though
he
respected
the
key
-
note
more
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
repeated
the
tune
and
lowered
his
fiddle
,
he
bowed
again
to
the
Squire
and
the
rector
,
and
said
,
"
I
hope
I
see
your
honour
and
your
reverence
well
,
and
wishing
you
health
and
long
life
and
a
happy
New
Year
.
 
<EOS>
And
wishing
the
same
to
you
,
Mr.
Lammeter
,
sir
;
and
to
the
other
gentlemen
,
and
the
madams
,
and
the
young
lasses
.
<EOS>
"
  
As
Solomon
uttered
the
last
words
,
he
bowed
in
all
directions
solicitously
,
lest
he
should
be
wanting
in
due
respect
.
 
<EOS>
But
thereupon
he
immediately
began
to
prelude
,
and
fell
into
the
tune
which
he
knew
would
be
taken
as
a
special
compliment
by
Mr.
Lammeter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
ye
,
Solomon
,
thank
ye
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammeter
when
the
fiddle
paused
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
"
Over
the
hills
and
far
away
"
,
that
is
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
used
to
say
to
me
,
whenever
we
heard
that
tune
,
"
Ah
,
lad
,
_
<EOS>
I
_
come
from
over
the
hills
and
far
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
many
tunes
I
do
n't
make
head
or
tail
of
;
but
that
speaks
to
me
like
the
blackbird
's
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
's
the
name
:
there
's
a
deal
in
the
name
of
a
tune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Solomon
was
already
impatient
to
prelude
again
,
and
presently
broke
with
much
spirit
into
"
Sir
Roger
de
Coverley
"
,
at
which
there
was
a
sound
of
chairs
pushed
back
,
and
laughing
voices
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
Solomon
,
we
know
what
that
means
,
"
said
the
Squire
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
time
to
begin
the
dance
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Lead
the
way
,
then
,
and
we
'll
all
follow
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Solomon
,
holding
his
white
head
on
one
side
,
and
playing
vigorously
,
marched
forward
at
the
head
of
the
gay
procession
into
the
White
Parlour
,
where
the
mistletoe
-
bough
was
hung
,
and
multitudinous
tallow
candles
made
rather
a
brilliant
effect
,
gleaming
from
among
the
berried
holly
-
boughs
,
and
reflected
in
the
old
-
fashioned
oval
mirrors
fastened
in
the
panels
of
the
white
wainscot
.
 
<EOS>
A
quaint
procession
!
 
<EOS>
Old
Solomon
,
in
his
seedy
clothes
and
long
white
locks
,
seemed
to
be
luring
that
decent
company
by
the
magic
scream
of
his
fiddle
 
luring
discreet
matrons
in
turban
-
shaped
caps
,
nay
,
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
herself
,
<EOS>
the
summit
of
whose
perpendicular
feather
was
on
a
level
with
the
Squire
's
shoulder
 
luring
fair
lasses
complacently
conscious
of
very
short
waists
and
skirts
blameless
of
front
-
folds
 
luring
burly
fathers
in
large
variegated
waistcoats
,
and
ruddy
sons
,
for
the
most
part
shy
and
sheepish
,
in
short
nether
garments
and
very
long
coat
-
tails
.
  
<EOS>
Already
Mr.
Macey
and
a
few
other
privileged
villagers
,
who
were
allowed
to
be
spectators
on
these
great
occasions
,
were
seated
on
benches
placed
for
them
near
the
door
;
and
great
was
the
admiration
and
satisfaction
in
that
quarter
when
the
couples
had
formed
themselves
for
the
dance
,
and
the
Squire
led
off
with
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
,
joining
hands
with
the
rector
and
Mrs.
Osgood
.
<EOS>
That
was
as
it
should
be
 
<EOS>
that
was
what
everybody
had
been
used
to
 
and
<EOS>
the
charter
of
Raveloe
seemed
to
be
renewed
by
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
thought
of
as
an
unbecoming
levity
for
the
old
and
middle
-
aged
people
to
dance
a
little
before
sitting
down
to
cards
,
but
rather
as
part
of
their
social
duties
.
 
<EOS>
For
what
were
these
if
not
to
be
merry
at
appropriate
times
,
interchanging
visits
and
poultry
with
due
frequency
,
paying
each
other
old
-
established
compliments
in
sound
traditional
phrases
,
passing
well
-
tried
personal
jokes
,
urging
your
guests
to
eat
and
drink
too
much
out
of
hospitality
,
and
eating
and
drinking
too
much
in
your
neighbour
's
house
to
show
that
you
liked
your
cheer
?
 
<EOS>
And
the
parson
naturally
set
an
example
in
these
social
duties
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
the
Raveloe
mind
,
without
a
peculiar
revelation
,
to
know
that
a
clergyman
should
be
a
pale
-
faced
memento
of
solemnities
,
instead
of
a
reasonably
faulty
man
whose
exclusive
authority
to
read
prayers
and
preach
,
to
christen
,
marry
,
and
bury
you
,
necessarily
coexisted
with
the
right
to
sell
you
the
ground
to
be
buried
in
and
to
take
tithe
in
kind
;
on
which
last
point
,
of
course
,
there
was
a
little
grumbling
,
but
not
to
the
extent
of
irreligion
 
not
of
deeper
significance
than
the
grumbling
at
the
rain
,
which
was
by
no
means
accompanied
with
a
spirit
of
impious
defiance
,
but
with
a
desire
that
the
prayer
for
fine
weather
might
be
read
forthwith
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
reason
,
then
,
why
the
rector
's
dancing
should
not
be
received
as
part
of
the
fitness
of
things
quite
as
much
as
the
Squire
's
,
or
why
,
on
the
other
hand
,
Mr.
Macey
's
official
respect
should
restrain
him
from
subjecting
the
parson
's
performance
to
that
criticism
with
which
minds
of
extraordinary
acuteness
must
necessarily
contemplate
the
doings
of
their
fallible
fellow
-
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Squire
's
pretty
springe
,
considering
his
weight
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
,
"
and
he
stamps
uncommon
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Lammeter
beats
'em
all
for
shapes
:
you
see
he
holds
his
head
like
a
sodger
,
and
he
is
n't
so
cushiony
as
most
o

The

much
of

adding

however

in

undertone
to
Mr.

Hey

<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
screwed
up
his
mouth
,
leaned
his
head
further
on
one
side
,
and
twirled
his
thumbs
with
a
presto
movement
as
his
eyes
followed
Godfrey
up
the
dance
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
summed
up
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
down'ard
,
but
a
bit
too
round
<EOS>
i
'
the
shoulder
-
blades
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
them
coats
as
he
gets
from
the
Flitton
tailor
,
they
're
a
poor
cut
to
pay
double
money
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr.
Macey
,
you
and
me
are
two
folks
,
"
said
Ben
,
slightly
indignant
at
this
carping
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
've
got
a
pot
o
'
good
ale
,
I
like
to
swaller
it
,
and
do
my
inside
good
,
i'stead
o
'
smelling
and
staring
at
it
to
see
if
I
ca
n't
find

<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
pick
me
out
a
finer

limbed
young
fellow

Master

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tchuh
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Mr.
Macey
,
provoked
to
increased
severity
,
"
he
is
n't
come
to
his
right
colour
yet
:
<EOS>
he
's
partly
like
a
slack
-
baked
pie
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
doubt
he
's
got
a
soft
place
in
his
head
,
else
why
should
he
be
turned
round
the
finger
by
that
offal
Dunsey
as
nobody
's
seen
o
'
late
,
and
let
him
kill
that
fine
hunting
hoss
as
was
the
talk
o
'
the
country
?
 
<EOS>
And
one
while
he
was
allays
after
Miss
Nancy
,
<EOS>
and
then
it
all
went
off
again
,
like
a
smell
<EOS>
o
'
hot
porridge
,
as
I
may
say
.
<EOS>
That
was
n't
my
way
when
_
I
_
went
a
-
coorting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
but
mayhap
Miss
Nancy
hung
off
,
like
,
and
your
lass
did
n't
,
"
said
Ben
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
she
did
n't
,
"
said
Mr.
Macey
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
Before
I
said
"
sniff
"
,
I
took
care
to
know
as
she
'd
say
"
snaff
"
,
and
pretty
quick
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
n't
a

going
to
open
_
<EOS>
my
_
mouth
,
like
a
dog
at
a
fly

and
snap
it
to
again
,
wi
'
nothing
to
swaller
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
think
Miss
Nancy
's
a
-
coming
round
again
,
"
said
Ben
,
"
for
Master
Godfrey
does
n't
look
so
down
-
hearted
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
see
he
's
for
taking
her
away
to
sit
down
<EOS>
,
now
they
're
at
the
end
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
the
dance
:
<EOS>
that
looks
like
sweethearting
,
that
does
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
reason
why
Godfrey
and
Nancy
had
left
the
dance
was
not
so
tender
as
Ben
imagined
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
close
press
of
couples
a
slight
accident
had
happened
to
Nancy
's
dress
,
which
,
while
it
was
short
enough
to
show
her
neat
ankle
in
front
,
was
long
enough
behind
to
be
caught
under
the
stately
stamp
of
the
Squire
's
foot
,
so
as
to
rend
certain
stitches
at
the
waist
,
and
cause
much
sisterly
agitation
in
Priscilla
's
mind
,
as
well
as
serious
concern
in
Nancy
's
.
 
<EOS>
One
's
thoughts
may
be
much
occupied
with
love
-
struggles
,
but
hardly
so
as
to
be
insensible
to
a
disorder
in
the
general
framework
of
things
.
<EOS>
Nancy
had
no
sooner
completed
her
duty
in
the
figure
they
were
dancing
than
she
said
to
Godfrey
,
with
a
deep
blush
,
that
she
must
go
and
sit
down
till
Priscilla
could
come
to
her
;
for
the
sisters
had
already
exchanged
a
short
whisper
and
an
open
-
eyed
glance
full
of
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
No
reason
less
urgent
than
this
could
have
prevailed
on
Nancy
to
give
Godfrey
this
opportunity
of
sitting
apart
with
her
.
<EOS>
As
for
Godfrey
,
he
was
feeling
so
happy
and
oblivious
under
the
long
charm
of
the
country
-
dance
with
Nancy
,
that
he
got
rather
bold
on
the
strength
of
her
confusion
,
and
was
capable
of
leading
her
straight
away
,
without
leave
asked
,
into
the
adjoining
small
parlour
,
where
the
card
-
tables
were
set
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Nancy
,
coldly
,
as
soon
as
she
perceived
where
he
was
going
,
"
not
in
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wait
here
till
Priscilla
's
ready
to
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
to
bring
you
out
of
the
dance
and
make
myself
troublesome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
'll
be
more
comfortable
here
by
yourself
,
"
said
the
artful
Godfrey
:
"
I
'll
leave
you
here
till
your
sister
can
come
.
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
an
indifferent
tone
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
an
agreeable
proposition
,
and
just
what
Nancy
desired
;
why
,
then
,
was
she
a
little
hurt
that
Mr.
Godfrey
should
make
it
?
 
<EOS>
They
entered
,
and
she
seated
herself
on
a
chair
against
one
of
the
card
-
tables
,
as
the
stiffest
and
most
unapproachable
position
she
could
choose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
she
said
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
need
n't
give
you
any
more
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
you
've
had
such
an
unlucky
partner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
ill
-
natured
of
you
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
standing
by
her
without
any
sign
of
intended
departure
,
"
to
be
sorry
you
've
danced
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
what
's
ill
-
natured
at
all
,
"
said
Nancy
,
looking
distractingly
prim
and
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
gentlemen
have
so
many
pleasures
,
one
dance
can
matter
but
very
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
is
n't
true
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
one
dance
with
you
matters
more
to
me
than
all
the
other
pleasures
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
,
long
while
since
Godfrey
had
said
anything
so
direct
as
that
,
and
Nancy
was
startled
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
instinctive
dignity
and
repugnance
to
any
show
of
emotion
made
her
sit
perfectly
still
,
and
only
throw
a
little
more
decision
into
her
voice
,
as
she
said
    
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Godfrey
,
that
's
not
known
to
me
,
and
I
have
very
good
reasons
for
thinking
different
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
it
's
true
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
never
forgive
me
,
then
,
Nancy
 
never
think
well
of
me
,
let
what
would
happen
 
<EOS>
would
you
never
think
the
present
made
amends
for
the
past
?
 
<EOS>
Not
if
I
turned
a
good
fellow
,
and
gave
up
everything
you
did
n't
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
was
half
conscious
that
this
sudden
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Nancy
alone
had
driven
him
beside
himself
;
but
blind
feeling
had
got
the
mastery
of
his
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
really
felt
much
agitated
by
the
possibility
Godfrey
's
words
suggested
,
but
this
very
pressure
of
emotion
that
she
was
in
danger
of
finding
too
strong
for
her
roused
all
her
power
of
self
-
command
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
glad
to
see
a
good
change
in
anybody
,
Mr.
Godfrey
,
"
she
answered
,
with
the
slightest
discernible
difference
of
tone
,
"
but
it
'
ud
be
better
if
no
change
was
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
hard
-
hearted
,
Nancy
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
pettishly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
might
encourage
me
to
be
a
better
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
miserable
 
<EOS>
but
you
've
no
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
those
have
the
least
feeling
that
act
wrong
to
begin
with
,
"
said
Nancy
,
sending
out
a
flash
in
spite
of
herself
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
was
delighted
with
that
little
flash
,
and
would
have
liked
to
go
on
and
make
her
quarrel
with
him
;
Nancy
was
so
exasperatingly
quiet
and
firm
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
indifferent
to
him
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
yet
_
,
though
    
The
entrance
of
Priscilla
,
bustling
forward
and
saying
,
"
Dear
heart
alive
,
child
,
let
us
look
at
this
gown
,
"
cut
off
Godfrey
's
hopes
of
a
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
must
go
now
,
"
he
said
to
Priscilla
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
matter
to
me
whether
you
go
or
stay
,
"
said
that
frank
lady
,
searching
for
something
in
her
pocket
,
with
a
preoccupied
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
_
you
_
want
me
to
go
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
,
looking
at
Nancy
,
who
was
now
standing
up
by
Priscilla
's
order
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
like
,
"
said
Nancy
,
trying
to
recover
all
her
former
coldness
,
and
looking
down
carefully
at
the
hem
of
her
gown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
like
to
stay
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
with
a
reckless
determination
to
get
as
much
of
this
joy
as
he
could
to
-
night
,
and
think
nothing
of
the
morrow
.
    
<EOS>
While
Godfrey
Cass
was
taking
draughts
of
forgetfulness
from
the
sweet
presence
of
Nancy
,
willingly
losing
all
sense
of
that
hidden
bond
which
at
other
moments
galled
and
fretted
him
so
as
to
mingle
irritation
with
the
very
sunshine
,
Godfrey
's
wife
was
walking
with
slow
uncertain
steps
through
the
snow
-
covered
Raveloe
lanes
,
carrying
her
child
in
her
arms
.
  
<EOS>
This
journey
on
New
Year
's
Eve
was
a
premeditated
act
of
vengeance
which
she
had
kept
in
her
heart
ever
since
Godfrey
,
in
a
fit
of
passion
,
had
told
her
he
would
sooner
die
than
acknowledge
her
as
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
There
would
be
a
great
party
at
the
Red
House
on
New
Year
's
Eve
,
she
knew
:
her
husband
would
be
smiling
and
smiled
upon
,
hiding
_
<EOS>
her
_
existence
in
the
darkest
corner
of
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
would
mar
his
pleasure
:
she
would
go
in
her
dingy
rags
,
with
her
faded
face
,
once
as
handsome
as
the
best
,
with
her
little
child
that
had
its
father
's
hair
and
eyes
,
and
disclose
herself
to
the
Squire
as
his
eldest
son
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
is
seldom
that
the
miserable
can
help
regarding
their
misery
as
a
wrong
inflicted
by
those
who
are
less
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
Molly
knew
that
the
cause
of
her
dingy
rags
was
not
her
husband
's
neglect
,
but
the
demon
Opium
to
whom
she
was
enslaved
,
body
and
soul
,
except
in
the
lingering
mother
's
tenderness
that
refused
to
give
him
her
hungry
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
this
well
;
and
yet
,
in
the
moments
of
wretched
unbenumbed
consciousness
,
the
sense
of
her
want
and
degradation
transformed
itself
continually
into
bitterness
towards
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
was
well
off
;
and
if
she
had
her
rights
she
would
be
well
off
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
belief
that
he
repented
his
marriage
,
and
suffered
from
it
,
only
aggravated
her
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
Just
and
self
-
reproving
thoughts
do
not
come
to
us
too
thickly
,
even
in
the
purest
air
,
and
with
the
best
lessons
of
heaven
and
earth
;
how
should
those
white
-
winged
delicate
messengers
make
their
way
to
Molly
's
poisoned
chamber
,
inhabited
by
no
higher
memories
than
those
of
a
barmaid
's
paradise
of
pink
ribbons
and
gentlemen
's
jokes
?
  
<EOS>
She
had
set
out
at
an
early
hour
,
but
had
lingered
on
the
road
,
inclined
by
her
indolence
to
believe
that
if
she
waited
under
a
warm
shed
the
snow
would
cease
to
fall
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
waited
longer
than
she
knew
,
and
now
that
she
found
herself
belated
in
the
snow
-
hidden
ruggedness
of
the
long
lanes
,
even
the
animation
of
a
vindictive
purpose
could
not
keep
her
spirit
from
failing
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
seven
o'clock
,
and
by
this
time
she
was
not
very
far
from
Raveloe
,
but
she
was
not
familiar
enough
with
those
monotonous
lanes
to
know
how
near
she
was
to
her
journey
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
She
needed
comfort
,
and
she
knew
<EOS>
but
one
comforter
 
<EOS>
the
familiar
demon
in
her
bosom
<EOS>
;
but
she
hesitated
a
moment
,
after
drawing
out
the
black
remnant
,
before
she
raised
it
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
In
that
moment
the
mother
's
love
pleaded
for
painful
consciousness
rather
than
oblivion
 
pleaded
to
be
left
in
aching
weariness
,
rather
than
to
have
the
encircling
arms
benumbed
so
that
they
could
not
feel
the
dear
burden
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
Molly
had
flung
something
away
,
but
it
was
not
the
black
remnant
 
<EOS>
it
was
an
empty
phial
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
walked
on
again
under
the
breaking
cloud
,
from
which
there
came
now
<EOS>
and
then
the
light
of
a
quickly
veiled
star
,
for
a
freezing
wind
had
sprung
up
since
the
snowing
had
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
walked
always
more
and
more
drowsily
,
and
clutched
more
and
more
automatically
the
sleeping
child
at
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
the
demon
was
working
his
will
,
and
cold
and
weariness
were
his
helpers
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
she
felt
nothing
but
a
supreme
immediate
longing
that
curtained
off
all
futurity
 
the
longing
to
lie
down
and
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
arrived
at
a
spot
where
her
footsteps
were
no
longer
checked
by
a
hedgerow
,
and
she
had
wandered
vaguely
,
unable
to
distinguish
any
objects
,
notwithstanding
the
wide
whiteness
around
her
,
and
the
growing
starlight
.
 
<EOS>
She
sank
down
against
a
straggling
furze
bush
,
an
easy
pillow
enough
;
and
the
bed
of
snow
,
too
,
was
soft
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
feel
that
the
bed
was
cold
,
and
did
not
heed
whether
the
child
would
wake
and
cry
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
arms
had
not
yet
relaxed
their
instinctive
clutch
;
and
the
little
one
slumbered
on
as
gently
as
if
it
had
been
rocked
in
a
lace
-
trimmed
cradle
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
complete
torpor
came
at
last
<EOS>
:
the
fingers
lost
their
tension
,
the
arms
unbent
;
then
the
little
head
fell
away
from
the
bosom
,
and
the
blue
eyes
opened
wide
on
the
cold
starlight
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
there
was
a
little
peevish
cry
of
"
mammy
"
,
and
an
effort
to
regain
the
pillowing
arm
and
bosom
;
but
mammy
's
ear
was
deaf
,
and
the
pillow
seemed
to
be
slipping
away
backward
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
as
the
child
rolled
downward
on
its
mother
's
knees
,
all
wet
with
snow
,
its
eyes
were
caught
by
a
bright
glancing
light
on
the
white
ground
,
and
,
with
the
ready
transition
of
infancy
,
it
was
immediately
absorbed
in
watching
the
bright
living
thing
running
towards
it
,
yet
never
arriving
.
 
<EOS>
That
bright
living
thing
must
be
caught
;
and
in
an
instant
the
child
had
slipped
on
all
-
fours
,
and
held
out
one
little
hand
to
catch
the
gleam
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
gleam
would
not
be
caught
in
that
way
,
and
now
the
head
was
held
up
to
see
where
the
cunning
gleam
came
from
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
from
a
very
bright
place
;
and
the
little
one
,
rising
on
its
legs
,
toddled
through
the
snow
,
the
old
grimy
shawl
in
which
it
was
wrapped
trailing
behind
it
,
and
the
queer
little
bonnet
dangling
at
its
back
 
toddled
on
to
the
open
door
of
Silas
Marner
's
cottage
,
and
right
up
to
the
warm
hearth
,
where
there
was
a
bright
fire
of
logs
and
sticks
,
which
had
thoroughly
warmed
the
old
sack
(
Silas
's
greatcoat
)
spread
out
on
the
bricks
to
dry
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
one
,
accustomed
to
be
left
to
itself
for
long
hours
without
notice
from
its
mother
,
squatted
down
on
the
sack
,
and
spread
its
tiny
hands
towards
the
blaze
,
in
perfect
contentment
,
gurgling
and
making
many
inarticulate
communications
to
the
cheerful
fire
,
like
a
new
-
hatched
gosling
beginning
to
find
itself
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
But
presently
the
warmth
had
a
lulling
effect
,
and
the
little
golden
head
sank
down
on
the
old
sack
,
and
the
blue
eyes
were
veiled
by
their
delicate
half
-
transparent
lids
.
  
<EOS>
But
where
was
Silas
Marner
while
this
strange
visitor
had
come
to
his
hearth
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
cottage
,
but
he
did
not
see
the
child
.
<EOS>
During
the
last
few
weeks
,
since
he
had
lost
his
money
,
he
had
contracted
the
habit
of
opening
his
door
and
looking
out
from
time
to
time
,
as
if
he
thought
that
his
money
might
be
somehow
coming
back
to
him
,
or
that
some
trace
,
some
news
of
it
,
might
be
mysteriously
on
the
road
,
and
be
caught
by
the
listening
ear
or
the
straining
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
chiefly
at
night
,
when
he
was
not
occupied
in
his
loom
,
that
he
fell
into
this
repetition
of
an
act
for
which
he
could
have
assigned
no
definite
purpose
,
and
which
can
hardly
be
understood
except
by
those
who
have
undergone
a
bewildering
separation
from
a
supremely
loved
object
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
evening
twilight
,
and
later
whenever
the
night
was
not
dark
,
Silas
looked
out
on
that
narrow
prospect
round
the
Stone
-
pits
,
listening
and
gazing
,
not
with
hope
,
but
with
mere
yearning
and
unrest
.
  
<EOS>
This
morning
he
had
been
told
by
some
of
his
neighbours
that
it
was
New
Year
's
Eve
,
and
that
he
must
sit
up
and
hear
the
old
year
rung
out
and
the
new
rung
in
,
because
that
was
good
luck
,
and
might
bring
his
money
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
only
a
friendly
Raveloe
-
way
of
jesting
with
the
half
-
crazy
oddities
of
a
miser
,
but
it
had
perhaps
helped
to
throw
Silas
into
a
more
than
usually
excited
state
.
 
<EOS>
Since
the
on
-
coming
of
twilight
he
had
opened
his
door
again
and
again
,
though
only
to
shut
it
immediately
at
seeing
all
distance
veiled
by
the
falling
snow
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
last
time
he
opened
it
the
snow
had
ceased
,
and
the
clouds
were
parting
here
and
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
and
listened
,
and
gazed
for
a
long
while
 
there
was
really
something
on
the
road
coming
towards
him
then
,
but
he
caught
no
sign
of
it
;
and
the
stillness
and
the
wide
trackless
snow
seemed
to
narrow
his
solitude
,
and
touched
his
yearning
with
the
chill
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
in
again
,
and
put
his
right
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
to
close
it
 
<EOS>
but
he
did
not
close
it
<EOS>
:
he
was
arrested
,
as
he
had
been
already
since
his
loss
,
by
the
invisible
wand
of
catalepsy
,
and
stood
like
a
graven
image
,
with
wide
but
sightless
eyes
,
holding
open
his
door
,
powerless
to
resist
either
the
good
or
the
evil
that
might
enter
there
.
  
<EOS>
When
Marner
's
sensibility
returned
,
he
continued
the
action
which
had
been
arrested
,
and
closed
his
door
,
unaware
of
the
chasm
in
his
consciousness
,
unaware
of
any
intermediate
change
,
except
that
the
light
had
grown
dim
,
and
that
he
was
chilled
and
faint
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
he
had
been
too
long
standing
at
the
door
and
looking
out
.
 
<EOS>
Turning
towards
the
hearth
,
where
the
two
logs
had
fallen
apart
,
and
sent
forth
only
a
red
uncertain
glimmer
,
he
seated
himself
on
his
fireside
chair
,
and
was
stooping
to
push
his
logs
together
,
when
,
to
his
blurred
vision
,
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
gold
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
Gold
!
 
<EOS>
his
own
gold
 
brought
back
to
him
as
mysteriously
as
it
had
been
taken
away
!
 
<EOS>
He
felt
his
heart
begin
to
beat
violently
,
and
for
a
few
moments
he
was
unable
to
stretch
out
his
hand
and
grasp
the
restored
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
The
heap
of
gold
seemed
to
glow
and
get
larger
beneath
his
agitated
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
He
leaned
forward
at
last
,
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
;
but
instead
of
the
hard
coin
with
the
familiar
resisting
outline
,
his
fingers
encountered
soft
warm
curls
.
 
<EOS>
In
utter
amazement
,
Silas
fell
on
his
knees
and
bent
his
head
low
to
examine
the
marvel
:
it
was
a
sleeping
child
 
a
round
,
fair
thing
,
with
soft
yellow
rings
all
over
its
head
.
 
<EOS>
Could
this
be
his
little
sister
<EOS>
come
back
to
him
in
a
dream
 
his
little
sister
whom
he
had
carried
about
in
his
arms
for
a
year
before
she
died
,
when
he
was
a
small
boy
without
shoes
or
stockings
?
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
first
thought
that
darted
across
Silas
's
blank
wonderment
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Was
_
it
a
dream
?
 
<EOS>
He
rose
to
his
feet
again
,
pushed
his
logs
together
,
and
,
throwing
on
some
dried
leaves
and
sticks
,
raised
a
flame
;
but
the
flame
did
not
disperse
the
vision
 
<EOS>
it
only
lit
up
more
distinctly
the
little
round
form
of
the
child
,
and
its
shabby
clothing
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
much
like
his
little
sister
.
<EOS>
Silas
sank
into
his
chair
powerless
,
under
the
double
presence
of
an
inexplicable
surprise
and
a
hurrying
influx
of
memories
.
 
<EOS>
How
and
when
had
the
child
come
in
without
his
knowledge
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
beyond
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
But
along
with
that
question
,
and
almost
thrusting
it
away
,
there
was
a
vision
of
the
old
home
and
the
old
streets
leading
to
Lantern
Yard
 
and
within
that
vision
another
,
of
the
thoughts
which
had
been
present
with
him
in
those
far
-
off
scenes
.
<EOS>
The
thoughts
were
strange
to
him
now
,
like
old
friendships
impossible
to
revive
;
and
yet
he
had
a
dreamy
feeling
that
this
child
was
somehow
a
message
come
to
him
from
that
far
-
off
life
<EOS>
:
it
stirred
fibres
that
had
never
been
moved
in
Raveloe
 
old
quiverings
of
tenderness
 
old
impressions
of
awe
at
the
presentiment
of
some
Power
presiding
over
his
life
;
for
his
imagination
had
not
yet
extricated
itself
from
the
sense
of
mystery
in
the
child
's
sudden
presence
,
and
had
formed
no
conjectures
of
ordinary
natural
means
by
which
the
event
could
have
been
brought
about
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
cry
on
the
hearth
<EOS>
:
the
child
had
awaked
,
and
Marner
stooped
to
lift
it
on
his
knee
.
 
<EOS>
It
clung
round
his
neck
,
and
burst
louder
and
louder
into
that
mingling
of
inarticulate
cries
with
"
mammy
"
by
which
little
children
express
the
bewilderment
of
waking
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
pressed
it
to
him
,
and
almost
unconsciously
uttered
sounds
of
hushing
tenderness
,
while
he
bethought
himself
that
some
of
his
porridge
,
which
had
got
cool
by
the
dying
fire
,
would
do
to
feed
the
child
with
if
it
were
only
warmed
up
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
plenty
to
do
through
the
next
hour
.
 
<EOS>
The
porridge
,
sweetened
with
some
dry
brown
sugar
from
an
old
store
which
he
had
refrained
from
using
for
himself
,
stopped
the
cries
of
the
little
one
,
and
made
her
lift
her
blue
eyes
with
a
wide
quiet
gaze
at
Silas
,
as
he
put
the
spoon
into
her
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
she
slipped
from
his
knee
and
began
to
toddle
about
,
but
with
a
pretty
stagger
that
made
Silas
jump
up
and
follow
her
lest
she
should
fall
against
anything
that
would
hurt
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
only
fell
in
a
sitting
posture
on
the
ground
,
and
began
to
pull
at
her
boots
,
looking
up
at
him
with
a
crying
face
as
if
the
boots
hurt
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
her
on
his
knee
again
,
but
it
was
some
time
before
it
occurred
to
Silas
's
dull
bachelor
mind
that
the
wet
boots
were
the
grievance
,
pressing
on
her
warm
ankles
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
them
off
with
difficulty
,
and
baby
was
at
once
happily
occupied
with
the
primary
mystery
of
her
own
toes
,
inviting
Silas
,
with
much
chuckling
,
to
consider
the
mystery
too
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
wet
boots
had
at
last
suggested
to
Silas
that
the
child
had
been
walking
on
the
snow
,
and
this
roused
him
from
his
entire
oblivion
of
any
ordinary
means
by
which
it
could
have
entered
or
been
brought
into
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
prompting
of
this
new
idea
,
and
without
waiting
to
form
conjectures
,
he
raised
the
child
in
his
arms
,
and
went
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
opened
it
,
there
was
the
cry
of
"
mammy
"
again
,
which
Silas
had
not
heard
since
the
child
's
first
hungry
waking
.
 
<EOS>
Bending
forward
,
he
could
just
discern
the
marks
made
by
the
little
feet
on
the
virgin
snow
,
and
he
followed
their
track
to
the
furze
bushes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mammy
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
little
one
cried
again
and
again
,
stretching
itself
forward
so
as
almost
to
escape
from
Silas
's
arms
,
before
he
himself
was
aware
that
there
was
something
more
than
the
bush
before
him
 
that
there
was
a
human
body
,
with
the
head
sunk
low
in
the
furze
,
and
half
-
covered
with
the
shaken
snow
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
after
the
early
supper
-
time
at
the
Red
House
,
and
the
entertainment
was
in
that
stage
when
bashfulness
itself
had
passed
into
easy
jollity
,
when
gentlemen
,
conscious
of
unusual
accomplishments
,
could
at
length
be
prevailed
on
to
dance
a
hornpipe
,
and
when
the
Squire
preferred
talking
loudly
,
scattering
snuff
,
and
patting
his
visitors
'
backs
,
to
sitting
longer
at
the
whist
-
table
 
a
choice
exasperating
to
uncle
Kimble
,
who
,
being
always
volatile
in
sober
business
hours
,
became
intense
and
bitter
over
cards
and
brandy
,
shuffled
before
his
adversary
's
deal
with
a
glare
of
suspicion
,
and
turned
up
a
mean
trump
-
card
with
an
air
of
inexpressible
disgust
,
as
if
in
a
world
where
such
things
could
happen
one
might
as
well
enter
on
a
course
of
reckless
profligacy
.
<EOS>
When
the
evening
had
advanced
to
this
pitch
of
freedom
and
enjoyment
,
it
was
usual
for
the
servants
,
the
heavy
duties
of
supper
being
well
over
,
to
get
their
share
of
amusement
by
coming
to
look
on
at
the
dancing
;
so
that
the
back
regions
of
the
house
were
left
in
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
doors
by
which
the
White
Parlour
was
entered
from
the
hall
,
and
they
were
both
standing
open
for
the
sake
of
air
;
but
the
lower
one
was
crowded
with
the
servants
and
villagers
,
and
only
the
upper
doorway
was
left
free
.
 
<EOS>
Bob
Cass
was
figuring
in
a
hornpipe
,
and
his
father
,
very
proud
of
this
lithe
son
,
whom
he
repeatedly
declared
to
be
just
like
himself
in
his
young
days
in
a
tone
that
implied
this
to
be
the
very
highest
stamp
of
juvenile
merit
,
was
the
centre
of
a
group
who
had
placed
themselves
opposite
the
performer
,
not
far
from
the
upper
door
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
was
standing
a
little
way
off
,
not
to
admire
his
brother
's
dancing
,
but
to
keep
sight
of
Nancy
,
who
was
seated
in
the
group
,
near
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
aloof
,
because
he
wished
to
avoid
suggesting
himself
as
a
subject
for
the
Squire
's
fatherly
jokes
in
connection
with
matrimony
and
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
's
beauty
,
which
were
likely
to
become
more
and
more
explicit
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
the
prospect
of
dancing
with
her
again
when
the
hornpipe
was
concluded
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
very
pleasant
to
get
long
glances
at
her
quite
unobserved
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Godfrey
was
lifting
his
eyes
from
one
of
those
long
glances
,
they
encountered
an
object
as
startling
to
him
at
that
moment
as
if
it
had
been
an
apparition
from
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
was
_
an
apparition
from
that
hidden
life
which
lies
,
like
a
dark
by
-
street
,
behind
the
goodly
ornamented
facade
that
meets
the
sunlight
and
the
gaze
of
respectable
admirers
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
own
child
,
carried
in
Silas
Marner
's
arms
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
his
instantaneous
impression
,
unaccompanied
by
doubt
,
though
he
had
not
seen
the
child
for
months
past
;
and
when
the
hope
was
rising
that
he
might
possibly
be
mistaken
,
Mr.
Crackenthorp
and
Mr.
Lammeter
had
already
advanced
to
Silas
,
in
astonishment
at
this
strange
advent
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
joined
them
immediately
,
unable
to
rest
without
hearing
every
word
 
trying
to
control
himself
,
but
conscious
that
if
any
one
noticed
him
,
they
must
see
that
he
was
white
-
lipped
and
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
all
eyes
at
that
end
of
the
room
were
bent
on
Silas
Marner
;
the
Squire
himself
had
risen
,
and
asked
angrily
,
"
How
's
this
?
 
<EOS>
what
's
this
?
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
do
coming
in
here
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
for
the
doctor
 
<EOS>
I
want
the
doctor
,
"
Silas
had
said
,
in
the
first
moment
,
to
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
,
Marner
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
rector
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
doctor
's
here
;
but
say
quietly
what
you
want
him
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
woman
,
"
said
Silas
,
speaking
low
,
and
half
-
breathlessly
,
just
as
Godfrey
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
dead
,
I
think
 
dead
in
the
snow
at
the
Stone
-
pits
 
not
far
from
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
felt
a
great
throb
:
there
was
one
terror
in
his
mind
at
that
moment
:
<EOS>
it
was
,
that
the
woman
might
_
not
_
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
an
evil
terror
 
<EOS>
an
ugly
inmate
to
have
found
a
nestling
-
place
in
Godfrey
's
kindly
disposition
;
but
no
disposition
is
a
security
from
evil
wishes
to
a
man
whose
happiness
hangs
on
duplicity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
out
into
the
hall
there
.
<EOS>
I
'll
fetch
the
doctor
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Found
a
woman
in
the
snow
 
and
thinks
she
's
dead
,
"
he
added
,
speaking
low
to
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
"
Better
say
as
little
about
it
as
possible
:
it
will
shock
the
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Just
tell
them
a
poor
woman
is
ill
from
cold
and
hunger
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
and
fetch
Kimble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
however
,
the
ladies
had
pressed
forward
,
curious
to
know
what
could
have
brought
the
solitary
linen
-
weaver
there
under
such
strange
circumstances
,
and
interested
in
the
pretty
child
,
who
,
half
alarmed
and
half
attracted
by
the
brightness
and
the
numerous
company
,
now
frowned
and
hid
her
face
,
now
lifted
up
her
head
again
and
looked
round
placably
,
until
a
touch
or
a
coaxing
word
brought
back
the
frown
,
and
made
her
bury
her
face
with
new
determination
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
child
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
several
ladies
at
once
,
and
,
among
the
rest
,
Nancy
Lammeter
,
addressing
Godfrey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
 
<EOS>
some
poor
woman
's
who
has
been
found
in
the
snow
,
I
believe
,
"
was
the
answer
Godfrey
wrung
from
himself
with
a
terrible
effort
.
 
<EOS>
(
"
After
all
,
_
am
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
certain
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
he
hastened
to
add
,
silently
,
in
anticipation
of
his
own
conscience
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
'd
better
leave
the
child
here
,
then
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
good
-
natured
Mrs.
Kimble
,
hesitating
,
however
,
to
take
those
dingy
clothes
into
contact
with
her
own
ornamented
satin
bodice
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
one
<EOS>
o
'
the
girls
to
fetch
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
part
with
it
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
let
it
go
,
"
said
Silas
,
abruptly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
come
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
've
a
right
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
proposition
to
take
the
child
from
him
had
come
to
Silas
quite
unexpectedly
,
and
his
speech
,
uttered
under
a
strong
sudden
impulse
,
was
almost
like
a
revelation
to
himself
:
<EOS>
a
minute
before
,
he
had
no
distinct
intention
about
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
hear
the
like
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Mrs.
Kimble
,
in
mild
surprise
,
to
her
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
ladies
,
I
must
trouble
you
to
stand
aside
,
"
said
Mr.
Kimble
,
coming
from
the
card
-
room
,
in
some
bitterness
at
the
interruption
,
but
drilled
by
the
long
habit
of
his
profession
into
obedience
to
unpleasant
calls
,
even
when
he
was
hardly
sober
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
nasty
business
turning
out
now
,
eh
,
Kimble
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
"
He
might
ha
'
gone
for
your
young
fellow
 
<EOS>
the
'
prentice
,
there
 
what
's
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Might
?
 
<EOS>
aye
 
<EOS>
what
's
the
use
of
talking
about
might
?
<EOS>
"
 
growled
uncle
Kimble
,
hastening
out
with
Marner
,
and
followed
by
Mr.
Crackenthorp
and
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
me
a
pair
of
thick
boots
,
Godfrey
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
stay
,
let
somebody
run
to
Winthrop
's
and
fetch
<EOS>
Dolly
 
<EOS>
she
's
the
best
woman
to
get
.
 
<EOS>
Ben
was
here
himself
before
supper
;
is
he
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
I
met
him
,
"
said
Marner
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
could
n't
stop
to
tell
him
anything
,
only
I
said
I
was
going
for
the
doctor
,
and
he
said
the
doctor
was
at
the
Squire
's
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
made
haste
and
ran
,
and
there
was
nobody
to
be
seen
at
the
back
o
'
the
house
,
and
so
I
went
in
to
where
the
company
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
,
no
longer
distracted
by
the
bright
light
and
the
smiling
women
's
faces
,
began
to
cry
and
call
for
"
mammy
"
,
though
always
clinging
to
Marner
,
who
had
apparently
won
her
thorough
confidence
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
had
come
back
with
the
boots
,
and
felt
the
cry
as
if
some
fibre
were
drawn
tight
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
,
"
he
said
,
hastily
,
eager
for
some
movement
;
"
I
'll
go
and
fetch
the
woman
 
Mrs.
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pooh
 
send
somebody
else
,
"
said
uncle
Kimble
,
hurrying
away
with
Marner
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
let
me
know
if
I
can
be
of
any
use
,
Kimble
,
"
said
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
doctor
was
out
of
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
too
,
had
disappeared
:
he
was
gone
to
snatch
his
hat
and
coat
,
having
just
reflection
enough
to
remember
that
he
must
not
look
like
a
madman
;
but
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
into
the
snow
without
heeding
his
thin
shoes
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
he
was
on
his
rapid
way
to
the
Stone
-
pits
by
the
side
of
Dolly
,
who
,
though
feeling
that
she
was
entirely
in
her
place
in
encountering
cold
and
snow
on
an
errand
of
mercy
,
was
much
concerned
at
a
young
gentleman
's
getting
his
feet
wet
under
a
like
impulse
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
a
deal
better
go
back
,
sir
,
"
said
Dolly
,
with
respectful
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
no
call
to
catch
cold
;
and
I
'd
ask
you
if
you
'd
be
so
good
as
tell
my
husband
to
come
,
on
your
way
back
 
<EOS>
he
's
at
the
Rainbow
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
 
if
you
found
him
anyway
sober
enough
to
be
o
'
use
.
<EOS>
Or
else
,
there
's
Mrs.
Snell
'
ud
happen
<EOS>
send
the
boy
up
to
fetch
and
carry
,
for
there
may
be
things
wanted
from
the
doctor
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'll
stay
,
now
I
'm
once
out
 
<EOS>
I
'll
stay
outside
here
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
when
they
came
opposite
Marner
's
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
come
and
tell
me
if
I
can
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
you
're
very
good
:
you
've
a
tender
heart
,
"
said
Dolly
,
going
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
was
too
painfully
preoccupied
to
feel
a
twinge
of
self
-
reproach
at
this
undeserved
praise
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
up
and
down
,
unconscious
that
he
was
plunging
ankle
-
deep
in
snow
,
unconscious
of
everything
but
trembling
suspense
about
what
was
going
on
in
the
cottage
,
and
the
effect
of
each
alternative
on
his
future
lot
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
not
quite
unconscious
of
everything
else
.
 
<EOS>
Deeper
down
,
and
half
-
smothered
by
passionate
desire
and
dread
,
there
was
the
sense
that
he
ought
not
to
be
waiting
on
these
alternatives
;
that
he
ought
to
accept
the
consequences
of
his
deeds
,
own
the
miserable
wife
,
and
fulfil
the
claims
of
the
helpless
child
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
moral
courage
enough
to
contemplate
that
active
renunciation
of
Nancy
as
possible
for
him
:
he
had
only
conscience
and
heart
enough
to
make
him
for
ever
uneasy
under
the
weakness
that
forbade
the
renunciation
.
 
<EOS>
And
at
this
moment
his
mind
leaped
away
from
all
restraint
toward
the
sudden
prospect
of
deliverance
from
his
long
bondage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
dead
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
voice
that
predominated
over
every
other
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
she
is
,
I
may
marry
Nancy
;
and
then
I
shall
be
a
good
fellow
in
future
,
and
have
no
secrets
,
and
the
child
 
shall
be
taken
care
of
somehow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
across
that
vision
came
the
other
possibility
 
<EOS>
"
She
may
live
,
and
then
it
's
all
up
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
never
knew
how
long
it
was
before
the
door
of
the
cottage
opened
and
Mr.
Kimble
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
forward
to
meet
his
uncle
,
prepared
to
suppress
the
agitation
he
must
feel
,
whatever
news
he
was
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
waited
for
you
,
as
I
'd
come
so
far
,
"
he
said
,
speaking
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
it
was
nonsense
for
you
to
come
out
:
why
did
n't
you
send
one
of
the
men
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
to
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
dead
 
has
been
dead
for
hours
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
woman
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
,
feeling
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
young
woman
,
but
emaciated
,
with
long
black
hair
.
 
<EOS>
Some
vagrant
 
quite
in
rags
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
got
a
wedding
-
ring
on
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
fetch
her
away
to
the
workhouse
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
along
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
look
at
her
,
"
said
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
saw
such
a
woman
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
overtake
you
in
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kimble
went
on
,
and
Godfrey
turned
back
to
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
He
cast
only
one
glance
at
the
dead
face
on
the
pillow
,
which
Dolly
had
smoothed
with
decent
care
;
but
he
remembered
that
last
look
at
his
unhappy
hated
wife
so
well
,
that
at
the
end
of
sixteen
years
every
line
in
the
worn
face
was
present
to
him
when
he
told
the
full
story
of
this
night
.
  
<EOS>
He
turned
immediately
towards
the
hearth
,
where
Silas
Marner
sat
lulling
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
perfectly
quiet
now
,
but
not
asleep
 
only
soothed
by
sweet
porridge
and
warmth
into
that
wide
-
gazing
calm
which
makes
us
older
human
beings
,
with
our
inward
turmoil
,
feel
a
certain
awe
in
the
presence
of
a
little
child
,
such
as
we
feel
before
some
quiet
majesty
or
beauty
in
the
earth
or
sky
 
before
a
steady
glowing
planet
,
or
a
full
-
flowered
eglantine
,
or
the
bending
trees
over
a
silent
pathway
.
 
<EOS>
The
wide
-
open
blue
eyes
looked
up
at
Godfrey
's
without
any
uneasiness
or
sign
of
recognition
:
the
child
could
make
no
visible
audible
claim
on
its
father
;
and
the
father
felt
a
strange
mixture
of
feelings
,
a
conflict
of
regret
and
joy
,
that
the
pulse
of
that
little
heart
had
no
response
for
the
half
-
jealous
yearning
in
his
own
,
when
the
blue
eyes
turned
away
from
him
slowly
,
and
fixed
themselves
on
the
weaver
's
queer
face
,
which
was
bent
low
down
to
look
at
them
,
while
the
small
hand
began
to
pull
Marner
's
withered
cheek
with
loving
disfiguration
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
the
child
to
the
parish
to
-
morrow
?
"
 
<EOS>
asked
Godfrey
,
speaking
as
indifferently
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
says
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Marner
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
they
make
me
take
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
would
n't
like
to
keep
her
,
should
you
 
an
old
bachelor
like
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Till
anybody
shows
they
've
a
right
to
take
her
away
from
me
,
"
said
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
mother
's
dead
,
and
I
reckon
it
's
got
no
father
<EOS>
:
it
's
a
lone
thing
 
<EOS>
and
I
'm
a
lone
thing
.
 
<EOS>
My
money
's
gone
,
I
do
n't
know
where
 
<EOS>
and
this
is
come
from
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
 
<EOS>
I
'm
partly
mazed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
little
thing
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
give
something
towards
finding
it
clothes
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
found
half
-
a
-
guinea
,
and
,
thrusting
it
into
Silas
's
hand
,
he
hurried
out
of
the
cottage
to
overtake
Mr.
Kimble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
see
it
's
not
the
same
woman
I
saw
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
came
up
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pretty
little
child
:
the
old
fellow
seems
to
want
to
keep
it
;
that
's
strange
for
a
miser
like
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
gave
him
a
trifle
to
help
him
out
:
the
parish
is
n't
likely
to
quarrel
with
him
for
the
right
to
keep
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
<EOS>
but
I
've
seen
the
time
when
I
might
have
quarrelled
with
him
for
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
too
late
now
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
child
ran
into
the
fire
,
your
aunt
's
too
fat
to
overtake
it
:
she
could
only
sit
and
grunt
like
an
alarmed
sow
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
a
fool
you
are
,
Godfrey
,
to
come
out
in
your
dancing
shoes
and
stockings
in
this
way
 
and
you
one
of
the
beaux
of
the
evening
,
and
at
your
own
house
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
such
freaks
,
young
fellow
?
 
<EOS>
Has
Miss
Nancy
been
cruel
,
and
do
you
want
to
spite
her
by
spoiling
your
pumps
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
everything
has
been
disagreeable
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
tired
to
death
of
jigging
and
gallanting
,
and
that
bother
about
the
hornpipes
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'd
got
to
dance
with
the
other
Miss
Gunn
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
glad
of
the
subterfuge
his
uncle
had
suggested
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
prevarication
and
white
lies
which
a
mind
that
keeps
itself
ambitiously
pure
is
as
uneasy
under
as
a
great
artist
under
the
false
touches
that
no
eye
detects
but
his
own
,
are
worn
as
lightly
as
mere
trimmings
when
once
the
actions
have
become
a
lie
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
reappeared
in
the
White
Parlour
with
dry
feet
,
and
,
since
the
truth
must
be
told
,
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
gladness
that
was
too
strong
for
painful
thoughts
to
struggle
with
.
 
<EOS>
For
could
he
not
venture
now
,
whenever
opportunity
offered
,
to
say
the
tenderest
things
to
Nancy
Lammeter
 
to
promise
her
and
himself
that
he
would
always
be
just
what
she
would
desire
to
see
him
?
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
danger
that
his
dead
wife
would
be
recognized
:
those
were
not
days
of
active
inquiry
and
wide
report
;
and
as
for
the
registry
of
their
marriage
,
that
was
a
long
way
off
,
buried
in
unturned
pages
,
away
from
every
one
's
interest
but
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
Dunsey
might
betray
him
if
he
came
back
;
but
Dunsey
might
be
won
to
silence
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
events
turn
out
so
much
better
for
a
man
than
he
has
had
reason
to
dread
,
is
it
not
a
proof
that
his
conduct
has
been
less
foolish
and
blameworthy
than
it
might
otherwise
have
appeared
?
 
<EOS>
When
we
are
treated
well
,
we
naturally
begin
to
think
that
we
are
not
altogether
unmeritorious
,
and
that
it
is
only
<EOS>
just
we
should
treat
ourselves
well
,
and
not
mar
our
own
good
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
Where
,
after
all
,
would
be
the
use
of
his
confessing
the
past
to
Nancy
Lammeter
,
and
throwing
away
his
happiness
?
 
<EOS>
nay
,
hers
?
 
<EOS>
for
he
felt
some
confidence
that
she
loved
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
child
,
he
would
see
that
it
was
cared
for
:
he
would
never
forsake
it
;
he
would
do
everything
but
own
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
happy
in
life
without
being
owned
by
its
father
,
seeing
that
nobody
could
tell
how
things
would
turn
out
,
and
that
 
is
there
any
other
reason
wanted
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
that
the
father
would
be
much
happier
without
owning
the
child
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
a
pauper
's
burial
that
week
in
Raveloe
,
and
up
Kench
Yard
at
Batherley
it
was
known
that
the
dark
-
haired
woman
with
the
fair
child
,
who
had
lately
come
to
lodge
there
,
was
gone
away
again
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
the
express
note
taken
that
Molly
had
disappeared
from
the
eyes
of
men
.
<EOS>
But
the
unwept
death
which
,
to
the
general
lot
,
seemed
as
trivial
as
the
summer
-
shed
leaf
,
was
charged
with
the
force
of
destiny
to
certain
human
lives
that
we
know
of
,
shaping
their
joys
and
sorrows
even
to
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
Marner
's
determination
to
keep
the
"
tramp
's
child
"
was
matter
of
hardly
less
surprise
and
iterated
talk
in
the
village
than
the
robbery
of
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
That
softening
of
feeling
towards
him
which
dated
from
his
misfortune
,
that
merging
of
suspicion
and
dislike
in
a
rather
contemptuous
pity
for
him
as
lone
and
crazy
,
was
now
accompanied
with
a
more
active
sympathy
,
especially
amongst
the
women
.
 
<EOS>
Notable
mothers
,
who
knew
what
it
was
to
keep
children
"
whole
and
sweet
"
;
lazy
mothers
,
who
knew
what
it
was
to
be
interrupted
in
folding
their
arms
and
scratching
their
elbows
by
the
mischievous
propensities
of
children
just
firm
on
their
legs
,
were
equally
interested
in
conjecturing
how
a
lone
man
would
manage
with
a
two
-
year
-
old
child
on
his
hands
,
and
were
equally
ready
with
their
suggestions
:
the
notable
chiefly
telling
him
what
he
had
better
do
,
and
the
lazy
ones
being
emphatic
in
telling
him
what
he
would
never
be
able
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
notable
mothers
,
Dolly
Winthrop
was
the
one
whose
neighbourly
offices
were
the
most
acceptable
to
Marner
,
for
they
were
rendered
without
any
show
of
bustling
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
had
shown
her
the
half
-
guinea
given
to
him
by
Godfrey
,
and
had
asked
her
what
he
should
do
about
getting
some
clothes
for
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
Dolly
,
"
there
's
no
call
to
buy
,
no
more
nor
a
pair
o
'
shoes
;
for
I
've
got
the
little
petticoats
as
Aaron
wore
five
years
ago
,
and
it
's
ill
spending
the
money
on
them
baby
-
clothes
,
<EOS>
for
the
child
'
ull
grow
like
grass
<EOS>
i
'
May
,
bless
it
 
that
it
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
same
day
Dolly
brought
her
bundle
,
and
displayed
to
Marner
,
one
by
one
,
the
tiny
garments
in
their
due
order
of
succession
,
most
of
them
patched
and
darned
,
but
clean
and
neat
as
fresh
-
sprung
herbs
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
introduction
to
a
great
ceremony
with
soap
and
water
,
from
which
Baby
came
out
in
new
beauty
,
and
sat
on
Dolly
's
knee
,
handling
her
toes
and
chuckling
and
patting
her
palms
together
with
an
air
of
having
made
several
discoveries
about
herself
,
which
she
communicated
by
alternate
sounds
of
"
gug
-
gug
-
gug
"
,
and
"
mammy
"
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
mammy
"
was
not
a
cry
of
need
or
uneasiness
:
Baby
had
been
used
to
utter
it
without
expecting
either
tender
sound
or
touch
to
follow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anybody
'
ud
think
the
angils
in
heaven
could
n't
be
prettier
,
"
said
Dolly
,
rubbing
the
golden
curls
and
kissing
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
to
think
of
its
being
covered
wi
'
them
dirty
rags
 
and
the
poor
mother
 
froze
to
death
;
but
there
's
Them
as
took
care
of
it
,
and
brought
it
to
your
door
,
Master
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
open
,
and
it
walked
in
over
the
snow
,
like
as
if
it
had
been
a
little
starved
robin
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
say
the
door
was
open
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Silas
,
meditatively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
the
door
was
open
.
 
<EOS>
The
money
's
gone
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
,
and
this
is
come
from
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
mentioned
to
any
one
his
unconsciousness
of
the
child
's
entrance
,
shrinking
from
questions
which
might
lead
to
the
fact
he
himself
suspected
 
namely
,
that
he
had
been
in
one
of
his
trances
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Dolly
,
with
soothing
gravity
,
"
it
's
like
the
night
and
the
morning
,
and
the
sleeping
and
the
waking
,
and
the
rain
and
the
harvest
 
<EOS>
one
goes
and
the
other
comes
,
and
we
know
nothing
<EOS>
how
nor
where

<EOS>
We
may
strive
and
scrat
and
fend
,
but
it
's
little
we
can
do
arter
all
 
the
big
things
come
and
go
wi

<EOS>
no
striving
o

our'n
 
<EOS>
they
do
,
that
they
do
;
and
I
think
you
're
in
the
right
on
it
to
keep
the
little
un
,
Master
Marner
,
seeing
as
it
's
been
sent
to
you
,
though
there
's
folks
as
thinks
different
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
happen
be
a
bit
moithered
with
it
while
it
's
so
little
;
but
I
'll
come
,
and
welcome
,
and
see
to
it
for
you
:
<EOS>
I
've
a
bit
o
'
time
to
spare
most
days
,
for
when
one
gets
up
betimes
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
the
morning
,
the
clock
seems
to
stan
'
still
tow'rt
ten
,
afore
<EOS>
it
's
time
to
go
about
the
victual
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
as
I
say
,
I
'll
come
and
see
to
the
child
for
you
,
and
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
...
<EOS>
kindly
,
"
said
Silas
,
hesitating
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
glad
if
you
'll
tell
me
things
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
added
,
uneasily
,
leaning
forward
to
look
at
Baby
with
some
jealousy
,
as
she
was
resting
her
head
backward
against
Dolly
's
arm
,
and
eyeing
him
contentedly
from
a
distance
 
"
<EOS>
But
I
want
to
do
things
for
it
myself
,
else
it
may
get
fond
o
'
somebody
else
,
and
not
fond
o
'
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
used
to
fending
for
myself
in
the
house
 
<EOS>
I
can
learn
,
I
can
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Eh
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Dolly
,
gently
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
men
as
are
wonderful
handy
wi

children
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
are
awk'ard
and
contrairy
<EOS>
mostly
,
God
help
'em
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
drink
's
out
of
'em
,
they
are
n't
unsensible
,
though
they
're
bad
for
leeching
and
bandaging
 
so
fiery
and
unpatient
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
this
goes
first
,
next
the
skin
,
"
proceeded
Dolly
,
taking
up
the
little
shirt
,
and
putting
it
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Marner
,
docilely
,
bringing
his
eyes
very
close
,
that
they
might
be
initiated
in
the
mysteries
;
whereupon
Baby
seized
his
head
with
both
her
small
arms
,
and
put
her
lips
against
his
face
with
purring
noises
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
there
,
"
said
Dolly
,
with
a
woman
's
tender
tact
,
"
she
's
fondest
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
wants
to
go
o
'
<EOS>
your
lap
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
then
:
take
her
,
Master
Marner
;
you
can
put
the
things
on
,
and
then
you
can
say
as
you
've
done
for
her
from
the
first
of
her
coming
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Marner
took
her
on
his
lap
,
trembling
with
an
emotion
mysterious
to
himself
,
at
something
unknown
dawning
on
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Thought
and
feeling
were
so
confused
within
him
,
that
if
he
had
tried
to
give
them
utterance
,
he
could
only
have
said
that
the
child
was
come
instead
of
the
gold
 
that
the
gold
had
turned
into
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
garments
from
Dolly
,
and
put
them
on
under
her
teaching
;
interrupted
,
of
course
,
by
Baby
's
gymnastics
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
take
to
it
quite
easy
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
Dolly
;
"
but
what
shall
you
do
when
you
're
forced
to
sit
in
your
loom
?
<EOS>
For
she
'll
get
busier
and
mischievouser
every
day
 
she
will
,
bless
her
.
<EOS>
It
's
lucky
as
you
've
got
that
high
hearth
i'stead
of
a
grate
,
for
that
keeps
the
fire
more
out
of
her
reach
:
but
if
you
've
got
anything
as
can
be
spilt
or
broke
,
or
as
is
fit
to
cut
her
fingers
off
,
she
'll
be
at
it
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
<EOS>
but
right
you
should
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
meditated
a
little
while
in
some
perplexity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tie
her
to
<EOS>
the
leg
o
'
the
loom
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
at
last
 
"
tie
her
with
a
good
long
strip
o
'
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
mayhap
that
'll
do
,
as
it
's
a
little
gell
,
for
they
're
easier
persuaded
to
sit
i
'
one
place
nor
the
lads
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
the
lads
are
;
for
I
've
had
four
 
four
I
've
had
<EOS>
,
God
knows
 
and
if
you
was
to
take
and
tie
'em
up
,
they
'd
make
a
fighting
and
a
crying
as
if
you
was
ringing
the
pigs
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
bring
you
my
little
chair
,
and
some
bits
o
'
red
rag
and
things
for
her
to
play
wi
'
;
an
'
she
'll
sit
and
chatter
to
'em
as
if
they
was
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
if
it
was
n't
a
sin
to
the
lads
to
wish
'em
made
different
,
bless
'em
,
I
should
ha
'
been
glad
for
one
of
'em
to
be
a
little
gell
;
and
to
think
as
I
could
ha
'
taught
her
to
scour
,
and
mend
,
and
the
knitting
,
and
everything
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
teach
'em
this
little
un
,
Master
Marner
,
when
she
gets
old
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
'll
be
_
<EOS>
my
_
little
un
,
"
said
Marner
,
rather
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
She
'll
be
nobody
else
's
.
"
  
"
No
,
to
be
sure
;
you
'll
have
a
right
to
her
,
if
you
're
a
father
to
her
,
and
bring
her
up
according
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
"
added
Dolly
,
coming
to
a
point
which
she
had
determined
beforehand
to
touch
upon
,
"
you
must
bring
her
up
like
christened
folks
's
children
,
and
take
her
to
church
,
and
let
her
learn
her
catechise
,
as
my
little
Aaron
can
say
off
 
the
"
I
believe
"
,
and
everything
,
and
"
hurt
nobody
by
word
or
deed
"
,
 
as
well
as
if
he
was
the
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
you
must
do
,
Master
Marner
,
if
you
'd
do
the
right
thing
by
the
orphin
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Marner
's
pale
face
flushed
suddenly
under
a
new
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
was
too
busy
trying
to
give
some
definite
bearing
to
Dolly
's
words
for
him
to
think
of
answering
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
's
my
belief
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
as
the
poor
little
creatur
has
never
been
christened
,
and
it
's
nothing
<EOS>
but
right
as
the
parson
should
be
spoke
to
;
and
if
you
was
noways
unwilling
,
I
'd
talk
to
Mr.
Macey
about
it
this
very
day
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
the
child
ever
went
anyways
wrong
,
and
you
had
n't
done
your
part
by
it
,
Master
Marner
 
'
noculation
,
and
everything
to
save
it
from
harm
 
<EOS>
it
'
ud
be
a
thorn
<EOS>
i
'
your
bed
for
ever
o
'
<EOS>
this
side
the
grave
;
and
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
as
it
'
ud
be
easy
lying
down
for
anybody
when
they
'd
got
to
another
world
,
if
they
had
n't
done
their
part
by
the
helpless
children
as
come
wi'out
<EOS>
their
own
asking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
herself
was
disposed
to
be
silent
for
some
time
now
,
for
she
had
spoken
from
the
depths
of
her
own
simple
belief
,
and
was
much
concerned
to
know
whether
her
words
would
produce
the
desired
effect
on
Silas
.
<EOS>
He
was
puzzled
and
anxious
,
for
Dolly
's
word
"
christened
"
<EOS>
conveyed
no
distinct
meaning
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
only
heard
of
baptism
,
and
had
only
seen
the
baptism
of
grown
-
up
men
and
women
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
as
you
mean
by
"
christened
"
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
he
said
at
last
,
timidly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wo
n't
folks
be
good
to
her
without
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Master
Marner
,
"
said
Dolly
,
with
gentle
distress
and
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Had
you
never
no
father
nor
mother
as
taught
you
to
say
your
prayers
,
and
as
there
's
good
words
and
good
things
to
keep
us
from
harm
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Silas
,
in
a
low
voice
;
"
I
know
a
deal
about
that
 
used
to
,
used
to
.
 
<EOS>
But
your
ways
are
different
:
my
country
was
a
good
way
off
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
a
few
moments
,
and
then
added
,
more
decidedly
,
"
<EOS>
But
I
want
to
do
everything
as
can
be
done
for
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
And
whatever
's
right
for
it
<EOS>
i
'
this
country
,
and
<EOS>
you
think
'
ull
do
it
good
<EOS>
,
I
'll
act
according
,
if
you
'll
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
Dolly
,
inwardly
rejoiced
,
<EOS>
"
I
'll
ask
Mr.
Macey
to
speak
to
the
parson
about
it
;
and
you
must
fix
on
a
name
for
it
,
because
it
must
have
a
name
giv
'
<EOS>
it
when
it
's
christened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
's
name
was
Hephzibah
,
"
said
Silas
,
"
and
my
little
sister
was
named
after
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
that
's
a
hard
name
,
"
said
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
partly
think
it
is
n't
a
christened
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
Bible
name
,
"
said
Silas
,
old
ideas
recurring
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
've
no
call
to
speak
again
'
it
,
"
said
Dolly
,
rather
startled
by
Silas
's
knowledge
on
this
head
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
see
I
'm
no
scholard
,
and
I
'm
slow
at
catching
the
words
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
says
I
'm
allays
like
as
if
I
was
putting
the
haft
for
the
handle
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
he
says
 
for
he
's
very
sharp
,
God
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
awk'ard
calling
your
little
sister
by
such
a
hard
name
,
when
you
'd
got
nothing
big
to
say
,
like
 
was
n't
it
,
Master
Marner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
called
her
Eppie
,
"
said
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
it
was
noways
wrong
to
shorten
the
name
,
it
'
ud
be
a
deal
handier
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
'll
go
now
,
Master
Marner
,
and
I
'll
speak
about
the
christening
afore
dark
;
and
I
wish
you
the
best
o
'
luck
,
and
it
's
my
belief
as
it
'll
come
to
you
,
if
you
do
what
's
right
by
the
orphin
child
;
 
and
there
's
the
'
noculation
to
be
seen
to
;
<EOS>
and
as
to
washing
its
bits
o
'
things
,
you
need
look
to
nobody
but
me
,
for
I
can
do
'em
<EOS>
wi
'
one
hand
when
I
've
got
my
suds
about
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
the
blessed
angil
!
<EOS>
You
'll
let
me
bring
my
Aaron
one
<EOS>
o
'
these
days
,
and
he
'll
show
her
his
little
cart
as
his
father
's
made
for
him
,
and
the
black
-
and
-
white
pup
as
he
's
got
a
-
rearing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Baby
_
was
_
christened
,
the
rector
deciding
that
a
double
baptism
was
the
lesser
risk
to
incur
;
and
on
this
occasion
Silas
,
making
himself
as
clean
and
tidy
as
he
could
,
appeared
for
the
first
time
within
the
church
,
and
shared
in
the
observances
held
sacred
by
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
unable
,
by
means
of
anything
he
heard
or
saw
,
to
identify
the
Raveloe
religion
with
his
old
faith
;
if
he
could
at
any
time
in
his
previous
life
have
done
so
,
it
must
have
been
by
the
aid
of
a
strong
feeling
ready
to
vibrate
with
sympathy
,
rather
than
by
a
comparison
of
phrases
and
ideas
:
and
now
for
long
years
that
feeling
had
been
dormant
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
distinct
idea
about
the
baptism
and
the
church
-
going
,
except
that
Dolly
had
said
it
was
for
the
good
of
the
child
;
and
in
this
way
,
as
the
weeks
grew
to
months
,
the
child
created
fresh
and
fresh
links
between
his
life
and
the
lives
from
which
he
had
hitherto
shrunk
continually
into
narrower
isolation
.
 
<EOS>
Unlike
the
gold
which
needed
nothing
,
and
must
be
worshipped
in
close
-
locked
solitude
 
which
was
hidden
away
from
the
daylight
,
was
deaf
to
the
song
of
birds
,
and
started
to
no
human
tones
 
<EOS>
Eppie
was
a
creature
of
endless
claims
and
ever
-
growing
desires
,
seeking
and
loving
sunshine
,
and
living
sounds
,
and
living
movements
;
making
trial
of
everything
,
with
trust
in
new
joy
,
and
stirring
the
human
kindness
in
all
eyes
that
looked
on
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
gold
had
kept
his
thoughts
in
an
ever
-
repeated
circle
,
leading
to
nothing
beyond
itself
;
but
Eppie
was
an
object
compacted
of
changes
and
hopes
that
forced
his
thoughts
onward
,
and
carried
them
far
away
from
their
old
eager
pacing
towards
the
same
blank
limit
 
carried
them
away
to
the
new
things
that
would
come
with
the
coming
years
,
when
Eppie
would
have
learned
to
understand
how
her
father
Silas
cared
for
her
;
and
made
him
look
for
images
of
that
time
in
the
ties
and
charities
that
bound
together
the
families
of
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
The
gold
had
asked
that
he
should
sit
weaving
longer
and
longer
,
deafened
and
blinded
more
and
more
to
all
things
except
the
monotony
of
his
loom
and
the
repetition
of
his
web
;
but
Eppie
called
him
away
from
his
weaving
,
and
made
him
think
all
its
pauses
a
holiday
,
reawakening
his
senses
with
her
fresh
life
,
even
to
the
old
winter
-
flies
that
came
crawling
forth
in
the
early
spring
sunshine
,
and
warming
him
into
joy
because
_
<EOS>
she
_
had
joy
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
the
sunshine
grew
strong
and
lasting
,
so
that
the
buttercups
were
thick
in
the
meadows
,
Silas
might
be
seen
in
the
sunny
midday
,
or
in
the
late
afternoon
when
the
shadows
were
lengthening
under
the
hedgerows
,
strolling
out
with
uncovered
head
to
carry
Eppie
beyond
the
Stone
-
pits
to
where
the
flowers
grew
,
till
they
reached
some
favourite
bank
where
he
could
sit
down
,
while
Eppie
toddled
to
pluck
the
flowers
,
and
make
remarks
to
the
winged
things
that
murmured
happily
above
the
bright
petals
,
calling
"
Dad
-
dad
's
"
attention
continually
by
bringing
him
the
flowers
.
<EOS>
Then
she
would
turn
her
ear
to
some
sudden
bird
-
note
,
and
Silas
learned
to
please
her
by
making
signs
of
hushed
stillness
,
that
they
might
listen
for
the
note
to
come
again
:
so
that
when
it
came
,
she
set
up
her
small
back
and
laughed
with
gurgling
triumph
.
<EOS>
Sitting
on
the
banks
in
this
way
,
Silas
began
to
look
for
the
once
familiar
herbs
again
;
and
as
the
leaves
,
with
their
unchanged
outline
and
markings
,
lay
on
his
palm
,
there
was
a
sense
of
crowding
remembrances
from
which
he
turned
away
timidly
,
taking
refuge
in
Eppie
's
little
world
,
that
lay
lightly
on
his
enfeebled
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
child
's
mind
was
growing
into
knowledge
,
his
mind
was
growing
into
memory
:
as
her
life
unfolded
,
his
soul
,
long
stupefied
in
a
cold
narrow
prison
,
was
unfolding
too
,
and
trembling
gradually
into
full
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
influence
which
must
gather
force
with
every
new
year
:
the
tones
that
stirred
Silas
's
heart
grew
articulate
,
and
called
for
more
distinct
answers
;
shapes
and
sounds
grew
clearer
for
Eppie
's
eyes
and
ears
,
and
there
was
more
that
"
Dad
-
dad
"
was
imperatively
required
to
notice
and
account
for
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
by
the
time
Eppie
was
three
years
old
,
she
developed
a
fine
capacity
for
mischief
,
and
for
devising
ingenious
ways
of
being
troublesome
,
which
found
much
exercise
,
not
only
for
Silas
's
patience
,
but
for
his
watchfulness
and
penetration
.
 
<EOS>
Sorely
was
poor
Silas
puzzled
on
such
occasions
by
the
incompatible
demands
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
Winthrop
told
him
that
punishment
was
good
for
Eppie
,
and
that
,
as
for
rearing
a
child
without
making
it
tingle
a
little
in
soft
and
safe
places
now
and
then
,
it
was
not
to
be
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
there
's
another
thing
you
might
do
,
Master
Marner
,
"
added
Dolly
,
meditatively
:
"
<EOS>
you
might
shut
her
up
once
i
'
the
coal
-
hole
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
I
did
wi
'
Aaron
;
for
I
was
that
silly
<EOS>
wi
'
the
youngest
lad
,
as
I
could
never
bear
to
smack
him
.
 
<EOS>
Not
as
I
could
find
i
'
my
heart
to
let
him
stay
i
'
the
coal
-
hole
more
nor
a
minute
,
but
it
was
enough
to
colly
him
all
over
,
so
as
he
must
be
new
washed
and
dressed
,
and
it
was
as
good
as
a
rod
to
him
 
that
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
put
it
upo
'
<EOS>
your
conscience
,
Master
Marner
,
as
there
's
one
of
'em
<EOS>
you
must
choose
 
ayther
smacking
or
the
coal
-
hole
 
else
she
'll
get
so
masterful
,
there
'll
be
no
holding
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
was
impressed
with
the
melancholy
truth
of
this
last
remark
;
but
his
force
of
mind
failed
before
the
only
two
penal
methods
open
to
him
,
not
only
because
it
was
painful
to
him
to
hurt
Eppie
,
but
because
he
trembled
at
a
moment
's
contention
with
her
,
lest
she
should
love
him
the
less
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Let
even
an
affectionate
Goliath
get
himself
tied
to
a
small
tender
thing
,
dreading
to
hurt
it
by
pulling
,
and
dreading
still
more
to
snap
the
cord
,
and
which
of
the
two
,
pray
,
will
be
master
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
Eppie
,
with
her
short
toddling
steps
,
must
lead
father
Silas
a
pretty
dance
on
any
fine
morning
when
circumstances
favoured
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
For
example
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
wisely
chosen
a
broad
strip
of
linen
as
a
means
of
fastening
her
to
his
loom
when
he
was
busy
:
it
made
a
broad
belt
round
her
waist
,
and
was
long
enough
to
allow
of
her
reaching
the
truckle
-
bed
and
sitting
down
on
it
,
but
not
long
enough
for
her
to
attempt
any
dangerous
climbing
.
 
<EOS>
One
bright
summer
's
morning
<EOS>
Silas
had
been
more
engrossed
than
usual
in
"
setting
up
"
a
new
piece
of
work
,
an
occasion
on
which
his
scissors
were
in
requisition
.
 
<EOS>
These
scissors
,
owing
to
an
especial
warning
of
Dolly
's
,
had
been
kept
carefully
out
of
Eppie
's
reach
;
but
the
click
of
them
had
had
a
peculiar
attraction
for
her
ear
,
and
watching
the
results
of
that
click
,
she
had
derived
the
philosophic
lesson
that
the
same
cause
would
produce
the
same
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
had
seated
himself
in
his
loom
,
and
the
noise
of
weaving
had
begun
;
but
he
had
left
his
scissors
on
a
ledge
which
Eppie
's
arm
was
long
enough
to
reach
;
and
now
,
like
a
small
mouse
,
watching
her
opportunity
,
she
stole
quietly
from
her
corner
,
secured
the
scissors
,
and
toddled
to
the
bed
again
,
setting
up
her
back
as
a
mode
of
concealing
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
distinct
intention
as
to
the
use
of
the
scissors
;
and
having
cut
the
linen
strip
in
a
jagged
but
effectual
manner
,
in
two
moments
she
had
run
out
at
the
open
door
where
the
sunshine
was
inviting
her
,
while
poor
Silas
believed
her
to
be
a
better
child
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
happened
to
need
his
scissors
that
the
terrible
fact
burst
upon
him
<EOS>
:
Eppie
had
run
out
by
herself
 
had
perhaps
fallen
into
the
Stone
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
,
shaken
by
the
worst
fear
that
could
have
befallen
him
,
rushed
out
,
calling
"
Eppie
!
"
 
and
ran
eagerly
about
the
unenclosed
space
,
exploring
the
dry
cavities
into
which
she
might
have
fallen
,
and
then
gazing
with
questioning
dread
at
the
smooth
red
surface
of
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
cold
drops
stood
on
his
brow
.
<EOS>
How
long
had
she
been
out
?
<EOS>
There
was
one
hope
 
that
she
had
crept
through
the
stile
and
got
into
the
fields
,
where
he
habitually
took
her
to
stroll
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
grass
was
high
in
the
meadow
,
and
there
was
no
descrying
her
,
if
she
were
there
,
except
by
a
close
search
that
would
be
a
trespass
on
Mr.
Osgood
's
crop
.
<EOS>
Still
,
that
misdemeanour
must
be
committed
;
and
poor
Silas
,
after
peering
all
round
the
hedgerows
,
traversed
the
grass
,
beginning
with
perturbed
vision
to
see
Eppie
behind
every
group
of
red
sorrel
,
and
to
see
her
moving
always
farther
off
as
he
approached
.
 
<EOS>
The
meadow
was
searched
in
vain
;
and
he
got
over
the
stile
into
the
next
field
,
looking
with
dying
hope
towards
a
small
pond
which
was
now
reduced
to
its
summer
shallowness
,
so
as
to
leave
a
wide
margin
of
good
adhesive
mud
.
<EOS>
Here
,
however
,
sat
Eppie
,
discoursing
cheerfully
to
her
own
small
boot
,
which
she
was
using
as
a
bucket
to
convey
the
water
into
a
deep
hoof
-
mark
,
while
her
little
naked
foot
was
planted
comfortably
on
a
cushion
of
olive
-
green
mud
.
 
<EOS>
A
red
-
headed
calf
was
observing
her
with
alarmed
doubt
through
the
opposite
hedge
.
  
<EOS>
Here
was
clearly
a
case
of
aberration
in
a
christened
child
which
demanded
severe
treatment
;
but
Silas
,
overcome
with
convulsive
joy
at
finding
his
treasure
again
,
could
do
nothing
but
snatch
her
up
,
and
cover
her
with
half
-
sobbing
kisses
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
had
carried
her
home
,
and
had
begun
to
think
of
the
necessary
washing
<EOS>
,
that
he
recollected
the
need
that
he
should
punish
Eppie
,
and
"
make
her
remember
"
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
that
she
might
run
away
again
and
come
to
harm
,
gave
him
unusual
resolution
,
and
for
the
first
time
he
determined
to
try
the
coal
-
hole
 
a
small
closet
near
the
hearth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Naughty
,
naughty
Eppie
,
"
he
suddenly
began
,
holding
her
on
his
knee
,
and
pointing
to
her
muddy
feet
and
clothes
 
"
naughty
to
cut
with
the
scissors
and
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
Eppie
must
go
into
the
coal
-
hole
for
being
naughty
.
 
<EOS>
Daddy
must
put
her
in
the
coal
-
hole
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
half
-
expected
that
this
would
be
shock
enough
,
and
that
Eppie
would
begin
to
cry
.
 
<EOS>
But
instead
of
that
,
she
began
to
shake
herself
on
his
knee
,
as
if
the
proposition
opened
a
pleasing
novelty
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
he
must
proceed
to
extremities
,
he
put
her
into
the
coal
-
hole
,
and
held
the
door
closed
,
with
a
trembling
sense
that
he
was
using
a
strong
measure
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
moment
there
was
silence
,
but
then
came
a
little
cry
,
"
Opy
,
opy
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
Silas
let
her
out
again
,
saying
,
"
Now
Eppie
'
ull
never
be
naughty
again
,
else
she
must
go
in
the
coal
-
hole
 
<EOS>
a
black
naughty
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
weaving
must
stand
still
a
long
while
this
morning
,
for
now
Eppie
must
be
washed
,
and
have
clean
clothes
on
;
but
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
this
punishment
would
have
a
lasting
effect
,
and
save
time
in
future
 
though
,
perhaps
<EOS>
,
it
would
have
been
better
if
Eppie
had
cried
more
.
  
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
she
was
clean
again
,
and
Silas
having
turned
his
back
to
see
what
he
could
do
with
the
linen
band
,
threw
it
down
again
,
with
the
reflection
that
Eppie
would
be
good
without
fastening
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
round
again
,
and
was
going
to
place
her
in
her
little
chair
near
the
loom
,
when
she
peeped
out
at
him
with
black
face
and
hands
again
,
and
said
,
"
Eppie
in
de
toal
-
hole
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
total
failure
of
the
coal
-
hole
discipline
shook
Silas
's
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
'd
take
it
all
for
fun
,
"
he
observed
to
Dolly
,
"
if
I
did
n't
hurt
her
,
and
that
I
ca
n't
do
,
Mrs.
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
If
she
makes
me
a
bit
o
'
trouble
,
I
can
bear
it
.
<EOS>
And
she
's
got
no
tricks
but
<EOS>
what
she
'll
grow
out
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
's
partly
true
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
Dolly
,
sympathetically
;
"
and
if
you
ca
n't
bring
your
mind
to
frighten
her
off
touching
things
,
you
must
do
what
you
can
to
keep
'em
out
of
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
do
wi
'
the
pups
as
the
lads
are
allays
a
-
rearing
.
 
<EOS>
They
_
<EOS>
will
_
worry
and
gnaw
 
worry
and
gnaw
<EOS>
they
will
,
if
it
was
one
's
Sunday
cap
as
hung
anywhere
so
as
they
could
drag
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
no
difference
<EOS>
,
God
help
'em
:
it
's
the
pushing
o
'
the
teeth
as
sets
'em
on
<EOS>
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Eppie
was
reared
without
punishment
,
the
burden
of
her
misdeeds
being
borne
vicariously
by
father
Silas
.
 
<EOS>
The
stone
hut
was
made
a
soft
nest
for
her
,
lined
with
downy
patience
:
and
also
in
the
world
that
lay
beyond
the
stone
hut
<EOS>
she
knew
nothing
of
frowns
and
denials
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
difficulty
of
carrying
her
and
his
yarn
or
linen
at
the
same
time
,
Silas
took
her
with
him
in
most
of
his
journeys
to
the
farmhouses
,
unwilling
to
leave
her
behind
at
Dolly
Winthrop
's
,
who
was
always
ready
to
take
care
of
her
;
and
little
curly
-
headed
Eppie
,
the
weaver
's
child
,
became
an
object
of
interest
at
several
outlying
homesteads
,
as
well
as
in
the
village
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
had
been
treated
very
much
as
if
he
had
been
a
useful
gnome
or
brownie
 
a
queer
and
unaccountable
creature
,
who
must
necessarily
be
looked
at
with
wondering
curiosity
and
repulsion
,
and
with
whom
one
would
be
glad
to
make
all
greetings
and
bargains
as
brief
as
possible
,
but
who
must
be
dealt
with
in
a
propitiatory
way
,
and
occasionally
have
a
present
of
pork
or
garden
stuff
to
carry
home
with
him
,
seeing
that
without
him
there
was
no
getting
the
yarn
woven
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
Silas
met
with
open
smiling
faces
and
cheerful
questioning
,
as
a
person
whose
satisfactions
and
difficulties
could
be
understood
.
 
<EOS>
Everywhere
he
must
sit
a
little
and
talk
about
the
child
,
and
words
of
interest
were
always
ready
for
him
:
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
Master
Marner
,
you
'll
be
lucky
if
she
takes
the
measles
soon
and
easy
!
"
 
<EOS>
or
,
"
Why
,
there
is
n't
many
lone
men
'
<EOS>
ud
ha
'
been
wishing
to
take
up
with
a
little
un
like
that
:
but
I
reckon
the
weaving
makes
you
handier
than
men
as
do
out
-
door
work
 
<EOS>
you
're
partly
as
handy
as
a
woman
,
for
weaving
comes
next
to
spinning
.
"
 
<EOS>
Elderly
masters
and
mistresses
,
seated
observantly
in
large
kitchen
arm
-
chairs
,
shook
their
heads
over
the
difficulties
attendant
on
rearing
children
,
felt
Eppie
's
round
arms
and
legs
,
and
pronounced
them
remarkably
firm
,
and
told
Silas
that
,
if
she
turned
out
well
(
which
,
however
,
there
was
no
telling
)
,
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
him
to
have
a
steady
lass
to
do
for
him
when
he
got
helpless
.
 
<EOS>
Servant
maidens
were
fond
of
carrying
her
out
to
look
at
the
hens
and
chickens
,
or
to
see
if
any
cherries
could
be
shaken
down
in
the
orchard
;
and
the
small
boys
and
girls
approached
her
slowly
,
with
cautious
movement
and
steady
gaze
,
like
little
dogs
face
to
face
with
one
of
their
own
kind
,
till
attraction
had
reached
the
point
at
which
the
soft
lips
were
put
out
for
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
No
child
was
afraid
of
approaching
Silas
when
Eppie
was
near
him
:
there
was
no
repulsion
around
him
now
,
either
for
young
or
old
;
for
the
little
child
had
come
to
link
him
once
more
with
the
whole
world
.
<EOS>
There
was
love
between
him
and
the
child
that
blent
them
into
one
,
and
there
was
love
between
the
child
and
the
world
 
from
men
and
women
with
parental
looks
and
tones
,
to
the
red
lady
-
birds
and
the
round
pebbles
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
began
now
to
think
of
Raveloe
life
entirely
in
relation
to
Eppie
:
she
must
have
everything
that
was
a
good
in
Raveloe
;
and
he
listened
docilely
,
that
he
might
come
to
understand
better
what
this
life
was
,
from
which
,
for
fifteen
years
,
he
had
stood
aloof
as
from
a
strange
thing
,
with
which
he
could
have
no
communion
:
as
some
man
who
has
a
precious
plant
to
which
he
would
give
a
nurturing
home
in
a
new
soil
,
thinks
of
the
rain
,
and
the
sunshine
,
and
all
influences
,
in
relation
to
his
nursling
,
and
asks
industriously
for
all
knowledge
that
will
help
him
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
the
searching
roots
,
or
to
guard
leaf
and
bud
from
invading
harm
.
 
<EOS>
The
disposition
to
hoard
had
been
utterly
crushed
at
the
very
first
by
the
loss
of
his
long
-
stored
gold
:
the
coins
he
earned
afterwards
seemed
as
irrelevant
as
stones
brought
to
complete
a
house
suddenly
buried
by
an
earthquake
;
the
sense
of
bereavement
was
too
heavy
upon
him
for
the
old
thrill
of
satisfaction
to
arise
again
at
the
touch
of
the
newly
-
earned
coin
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
something
had
come
to
replace
his
hoard
which
gave
a
growing
purpose
to
the
earnings
,
drawing
his
hope
and
joy
continually
onward
beyond
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
In
old
days
there
were
angels
who
came
and
took
men
by
the
hand
and
led
them
away
from
the
city
of
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
no
white
-
winged
angels
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
yet
men
are
led
away
from
threatening
destruction
<EOS>
:
a
hand
is
put
into
theirs
,
which
leads
them
forth
gently
towards
a
calm
and
bright
land
,
so
that
they
look
no
more
backward
;
and
the
hand
may
be
a
little
child
's
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
one
person
,
as
you
will
believe
,
who
watched
with
keener
though
more
hidden
interest
than
any
other
,
the
prosperous
growth
of
Eppie
under
the
weaver
's
care
.
 
<EOS>
He
dared
not
do
anything
that
would
imply
a
stronger
interest
in
a
poor
man
's
adopted
child
than
could
be
expected
from
the
kindliness
of
the
young
Squire
,
when
a
chance
meeting
suggested
a
little
present
to
a
simple
old
fellow
whom
others
noticed
with
goodwill
;
but
he
told
himself
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
might
do
something
towards
furthering
the
welfare
of
his
daughter
without
incurring
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
Was
he
very
uneasy
in
the
meantime
at
his
inability
to
give
his
daughter
her
birthright
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
was
being
taken
care
of
,
and
would
very
likely
be
happy
,
as
people
in
humble
stations
often
were
 
happier
,
perhaps
,
than
those
brought
up
in
luxury
.
  
<EOS>
That
famous
ring
that
pricked
its
owner
when
he
forgot
duty
and
followed
desire
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
it
pricked
very
hard
when
he
set
out
on
the
chase
,
or
whether
it
pricked
but
lightly
then
,
and
only
pierced
to
the
quick
when
the
chase
had
long
been
ended
,
and
hope
,
folding
her
wings
,
looked
backward
and
became
regret
?
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
Cass
's
cheek
and
eye
were
brighter
than
ever
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
undivided
in
his
aims
,
that
he
seemed
like
a
man
of
firmness
.
 
<EOS>
No
Dunsey
had
come
back
:
people
had
made
up
their
minds
that
he
was
gone
for
a
soldier
,
or
gone
"
out
of
the
country
"
,
and
no
one
cared
to
be
specific
in
their
inquiries
on
a
subject
delicate
to
a
respectable
family
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
had
ceased
to
see
the
shadow
of
Dunsey
across
his
path
;
and
the
path
now
lay
straight
forward
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
best
,
longest
-
cherished
wishes
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
said
Mr.
Godfrey
had
taken
the
right
turn
;
and
it
was
pretty
clear
what
would
be
the
end
of
things
,
for
there
were
not
many
days
in
the
week
that
he
was
not
seen
riding
to
the
Warrens
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
himself
,
when
he
was
asked
jocosely
if
the
day
had
been
fixed
,
smiled
with
the
pleasant
consciousness
of
a
lover
who
could
say
"
yes
"
,
if
he
liked
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
a
reformed
man
,
delivered
from
temptation
;
and
the
vision
of
his
future
life
seemed
to
him
as
a
promised
land
for
which
he
had
no
cause
to
fight
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
himself
with
all
his
happiness
centred
on
his
own
hearth
,
while
Nancy
would
smile
on
him
as
he
played
with
the
children
.
  
<EOS>
And
that
other
child
 
not
on
the
hearth
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
forget
it
;
he
would
see
that
it
was
well
provided
for
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
a
father
's
duty
.
      
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
autumn
Sunday
,
sixteen
years
after
Silas
Marner
had
found
his
new
treasure
on
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
The
bells
of
the
old
Raveloe
church
were
ringing
the
cheerful
peal
which
told
that
the
morning
service
was
ended
;
and
out
of
the
arched
doorway
in
the
tower
came
slowly
,
retarded
by
friendly
greetings
and
questions
,
the
richer
parishioners
who
had
chosen
this
bright
Sunday
morning
as
eligible
for
church
-
going
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
rural
fashion
of
that
time
for
the
more
important
members
of
the
congregation
to
depart
first
,
while
their
humbler
neighbours
waited
and
looked
on
,
stroking
their
bent
heads
or
dropping
their
curtsies
to
any
large
ratepayer
who
turned
to
notice
them
.
  
<EOS>
Foremost
among
these
advancing
groups
of
well
-
clad
people
,
there
are
some
whom
we
shall
recognize
,
in
spite
of
Time
,
who
has
laid
his
hand
on
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
tall
blond
man
of
forty
is
not
much
changed
in
feature
from
the
Godfrey
Cass
of
six
-
and
-
twenty
:
he
is
only
fuller
in
flesh
,
and
has
only
lost
the
indefinable
look
of
youth
 
<EOS>
a
loss
which
is
marked
even
when
the
eye
is
undulled
and
the
wrinkles
are
not
yet
come
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
pretty
woman
,
not
much
younger
than
he
,
who
is
leaning
on
his
arm
,
is
more
changed
than
her
husband
:
the
lovely
bloom
that
used
to
be
always
on
her
cheek
now
comes
but
fitfully
,
with
the
fresh
morning
air
or
with
some
strong
surprise
;
yet
to
all
who
love
human
faces
best
for
what
they
tell
of
human
experience
,
Nancy
's
beauty
has
a
heightened
interest
.
 
<EOS>
Often
the
soul
is
ripened
into
fuller
goodness
while
age
has
spread
an
ugly
film
,
so
that
mere
glances
can
never
divine
the
preciousness
of
the
fruit
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
years
have
not
been
so
cruel
to
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
The
firm
yet
placid
mouth
,
the
clear
veracious
glance
of
the
brown
eyes
,
speak
now
of
a
nature
that
has
been
tested
and
has
kept
its
highest
qualities
;
and
even
the
costume
,
with
its
dainty
neatness
and
purity
,
has
more
significance
now
the
coquetries
of
youth
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Godfrey
Cass
(
any
higher
title
has
died
away
from
Raveloe
lips
since
the
old
Squire
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
his
inheritance
<EOS>
was
divided
)
have
turned
round
to
look
for
the
tall
aged
man
and
the
plainly
dressed
woman
who
are
a
little
behind
 
Nancy
having
observed
that
they
must
wait
for
"
father
and
Priscilla
"
 
<EOS>
and
now
they
all
turn
into
a
narrower
path
leading
across
the
churchyard
to
a
small
gate
opposite
the
Red
House
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
follow
them
now
;
for
may
there
not
be
some
others
in
this
departing
congregation
whom
we
should
like
to
see
again
 
some
of
those
who
are
not
likely
to
be
handsomely
clad
,
and
whom
we
may
not
recognize
so
easily
as
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
Red
House
?
  
<EOS>
But
it
is
impossible
to
mistake
Silas
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
His
large
brown
eyes
seem
to
have
gathered
a
longer
vision
,
as
is
the
way
with
eyes
that
have
been
short
-
sighted
in
early
life
,
and
they
have
a
less
vague
,
a
more
answering
gaze
;
but
in
everything
else
one
sees
signs
of
a
frame
much
enfeebled
by
the
lapse
of
the
sixteen
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
weaver
's
bent
shoulders
and
white
hair
give
him
almost
the
look
of
advanced
age
,
though
he
is
not
more
than
five
-
and
-
fifty
;
but
there
is
the
freshest
blossom
of
youth
close
by
his
side
 
a
blonde
dimpled
girl
of
eighteen
,
who
has
vainly
tried
to
chastise
her
curly
auburn
hair
into
smoothness
under
her
brown
bonnet
:
the
hair
ripples
as
obstinately
as
a
brooklet
under
the
March
breeze
,
and
the
little
ringlets
burst
away
from
the
restraining
comb
behind
and
show
themselves
below
the
bonnet
-
crown
.
<EOS>
Eppie
can
not
help
being
rather
vexed
about
her
hair
,
for
there
is
no
other
girl
in
Raveloe
who
has
hair
at
all
like
it
,
and
she
thinks
hair
ought
to
be
smooth
.
 
<EOS>
She
does
not
like
to
be
blameworthy
even
in
small
things
<EOS>
:
you
see
how
neatly
her
prayer
-
book
is
folded
in
her
spotted
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
That
good
-
looking
young
fellow
,
in
a
new
fustian
suit
,
who
walks
behind
her
,
is
not
quite
sure
upon
the
question
of
hair
in
the
abstract
,
when
Eppie
puts
it
to
him
,
and
thinks
that
perhaps
straight
hair
is
the
best
in
general
,
but
he
does
n't
want
Eppie
's
hair
to
be
different
.
 
<EOS>
She
surely
divines
that
there
is
some
one
behind
her
who
is
thinking
about
her
very
particularly
,
and
mustering
courage
to
come
to
her
side
as
soon
as
they
are
out
in
the
lane
,
else
why
should
she
look
rather
shy
,
and
take
care
not
to
turn
away
her
head
from
her
father
Silas
,
to
whom
she
keeps
murmuring
little
sentences
as
to
who
was
at
church
and
who
was
not
at
church
,
and
how
pretty
the
red
mountain
-
ash
is
over
the
Rectory
wall
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
_
we
_
had
a
little
garden
,
father
,
with
double
daisies
in
,
like
Mrs.
Winthrop
's
,
"
said
Eppie
,
when
they
were
out
in
the
lane
;
"
only
they
say
it
'
ud
take
a
deal
of
digging
and
bringing
fresh
soil
 
<EOS>
and
you
could
n't
do
that
,
<EOS>
could
you
,
father
?
 
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
I
should
n't
like
you
to
do
it
,
for
it
'
ud
be
too
hard
work
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
could
do
it
,
child
,
if
you
want
a
bit
o
'
garden
:
these
long
evenings
,
I
could
work
at
taking
in
a
little
bit
<EOS>
o
'
the
waste
,
just
enough
for
a
root
or
two
o
'
flowers
for
you
;
and
again
,
i
'
<EOS>
the
morning
,
I
could
have
a
turn
wi
'
the
spade
before
I
sat
down
to
the
loom
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
before
as
you
wanted
a
bit
o
'
garden
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
I
_
can
dig
it
for
you
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
the
young
man
in
fustian
,
who
was
now
by
Eppie
's
side
,
entering
into
the
conversation
without
the
trouble
of
formalities
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
play
to
me
after
I
've
done
my
day
's
work
,
or
any
odd
bits
<EOS>
o
'
time
when
the
work
's
slack
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
bring
you
some
soil
from
Mr.
Cass
's
garden
 
<EOS>
he
'll
let
me
,
and
willing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Aaron
,
my
lad
,
are
you
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
;
"
I
was
n't
aware
of
you
;
for
when
Eppie
's
talking
o
'
things
,
I
see
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
she
's
a
-
saying
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
if
you
could
help
me
with
the
digging
,
we
might
get
her
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
garden
all
the
sooner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
if
you
think
well
and
good
,
"
said
Aaron
,
"
I
'll
come
to
the
Stone
-
pits
this
afternoon
,
and
we
'll
settle
what
land
's
to
be
taken
in
,
and
I
'll
get
up
an
hour
earlier
<EOS>
i
'
the
morning
,
and
begin
on
it
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
not
if
you
do
n't
promise
me
not
to
work
at
the
hard
digging
,
father
,
"
said
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
I
should
n't
ha
'
said
anything
about
it
,
"
she
added
,
half
-
bashfully
,
half
-
roguishly
,
"
<EOS>
only
Mrs.
Winthrop
said
as
Aaron
'
ud
be
so
good
,
and
 
"
  
"
And
you
might
ha
'
known
it
without
mother
telling
you
,
"
said
Aaron
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Master
Marner
knows
too
,
I
hope
,
as
I
'm
able
and
willing
to
do
a
turn
o
'
work
for
him
,
and
he
wo
n't
do
me
the
unkindness
to
anyways
take
it
out

o

my
hands

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
now
,
father
,
you
wo
n't
work
in
it
till
it
's
all
easy
,
"
said
Eppie
,
"
and
you
and
me
can
mark
out
the
beds
,
and
make
holes
and
plant
the
roots
.
 
<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
deal
livelier
at
the
Stone
-
pits
when
we
've
got
some
flowers
,
<EOS>
for
I
always
think
the
flowers
can
see
us
and
know
what
we
're
talking
about
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
have
a
bit
o
'
rosemary
,
and
bergamot
,
and
thyme
,
because
they
're
so
sweet

smelling
;
but
there
's
no
lavender
only
in
the
gentlefolks
'
gardens
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
no
reason
why
you
should
n't
have
some
,
"
said
Aaron
,
"
for
I
can
bring
you
slips
of
anything
<EOS>
;
I
'm
forced
to
cut
no
end
of
'em
when
I
'm
gardening
,
and
throw
'em
away
mostly
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
<EOS>
a
big
bed
o
'
lavender
at
the
Red
House
<EOS>
:
the
missis
is
very
fond
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Silas
,
gravely
,
"
so
as
you
do
n't
make
free
for
us
,
or
ask
for
anything
as
is
worth
much
at
the
Red
House
:
for
Mr.
Cass
's
been
so
good
to
us
,
and
built
us
up
the
new
end
<EOS>
o

the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

no

there

no

"
said
Aaron
;
"
there
's
never

the
parish

what
there
's
endless
waste
in
it
for
want
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
somebody
as
could
use
everything
up

<EOS>
It
's
what
I
think
to
myself
sometimes
,
as
there
need
nobody
run
short
o
'
victuals
if
the
land
was
made
the
most
on
,
and
there
was
never
a
morsel
but
what
could
find
its
way
to
a
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
It
sets
one
thinking
o
'
that
 
gardening
does
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
go
back
now
,
else
mother
'
ull
be
in
trouble
as
I
are

there

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bring
her
with
you
this
afternoon
,
Aaron
,

said
Eppie
;
"
I
should
n't
like
to
fix
about

<EOS>
"
Aye

Silas

help
us
to
set
things
on

<EOS>
Aaron
turned
back
up
the
village
,
while
Silas
and
Eppie
went
on
up
the
lonely
sheltered
lane
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
daddy
!
"
 
<EOS>
she
began
,
when
they
were
in
privacy
,
clasping
and
squeezing
Silas
's
arm
,
and
skipping
round
to
give
him
an
energetic
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
little
old
daddy
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
so
glad

<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
want
anything
else
when
we
've
got
a
little
garden
;
and
I
knew
Aaron
would
dig
it
for
us

she
went
on
with
roguish
triumph
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
that
very
well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
deep
little
puss

you
are

"
said
Silas
,
with
the
mild
passive
happiness
of
love
-
crowned
age
in
his
face
;
"
but
you
'll
make
yourself
fine
and
beholden
to
Aaron

<EOS>
"
Oh

no

I

said
Eppie
,
laughing
and
frisking
;
"
he
likes
it

<EOS>
"
Come

come

let
me
carry
your

"
  
<EOS>
Eppie
was
now
aware
that
her
behaviour
was
under
observation
,
but
it
was
only
the
observation
of
a
friendly
donkey
,
browsing
with
a
log
fastened
to
his
foot
 
<EOS>
a
meek
donkey
,
not
scornfully
critical
of
human
trivialities
,
but
thankful
to
share
in
them
,
if
possible
,
by
getting
his
nose
scratched
;
and
Eppie
did
not
fail
to
gratify
him
with
her
usual
notice
,
though
it
was
attended
with
the
inconvenience
of
his
following
them
,
painfully
,
up
to
the
very
door
of
their
home
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
sound
of
a
sharp
bark
inside
,
as
Eppie
put
the
key
in
the
door
,
modified
the
donkey
's
views
,
and
he
limped
away
again
without
bidding
.
<EOS>
The
sharp
bark
was
the
sign
of
an
excited
welcome
that
was
awaiting
them
from
a
knowing
brown
terrier
,
who
,
after
dancing
at
their
legs
in
a
hysterical
manner
,
rushed
with
a
worrying
noise
at
a
tortoise
-
shell
kitten
under
the
loom
,
and
then
rushed
back
with
a
sharp
bark
again
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
I
have
done
my
duty
by
this
feeble
creature
,
you
perceive
"
;
while
the
lady
-
mother
of
the
kitten
sat
sunning
her
white
bosom
in
the
window
,
and
looked
round
with
a
sleepy
air
of
expecting
caresses
,
though
she
was
not
going
to
take
any
trouble
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
presence
of
this
happy
animal
life
was
not
the
only
change
which
had
come
over
the
interior
of
the
stone
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
bed
now
in
the
living
-
room
,
and
the
small
space
was
well
filled
with
decent
furniture
,
all
bright
and
clean
enough
to
satisfy
Dolly
Winthrop
's
eye
.
<EOS>
The
oaken
table
and
three
-
cornered
oaken
chair
were
hardly
what
was
likely
to
be
seen
in
so
poor
a
cottage
:
they
had
come
,
with
the
beds
and
other
things
,
from
the
Red
House
;
for
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
,
as
every
one
said
in
the
village
,
did
very
kindly
by
the
weaver
;
and
it
was
nothing
<EOS>
but
right
a
man
should
be
looked
on
and
helped
by
those
who
could
afford
it
,
when
he
had
brought
up
an
orphan
child
,
and
been
father
and
mother
to
her
 
and
had
lost
his
money
too
,
so
as
he
had
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
he
worked
for
week
by
week
,
and
when
the
weaving
was
going
down
too
 
for
there
was
<EOS>
less
and
less
flax
spun
 
and
Master
Marner
was
none
so
young
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
was
jealous
of
the
weaver
,
for
he
was
regarded
as
an
exceptional
person
,
whose
claims
on
neighbourly
help
were
not
to
be
matched
in
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
Any
superstition
that
remained
concerning
him
had
taken
an
entirely
new
colour
;
and
Mr.
Macey
,
now
a
very
feeble
old
man
of
fourscore
and
six
,
never
seen
except
in
his
chimney
-
corner
or
sitting
in
the
sunshine
at
his
door
-
sill
,
was
of
opinion
that
when
a
man
had
done
what
Silas
had
done
by
an
orphan
child
,
it
was
a
sign
that
his
money
would
come
to
light
again
,
or
leastwise
that
the
robber
would
be
made
to
answer
for
it
 
for
,
as
Mr.
Macey
observed
of
himself
,
his
faculties
were
as
strong
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
sat
down
now
and
watched
Eppie
with
a
satisfied
gaze
as
she
spread
the
clean
cloth
,
and
set
on
it
the
potato
-
pie
,
warmed
up
slowly
in
a
safe
Sunday
fashion
,
by
being
put
into
a
dry
pot
over
a
slowly
-
dying
fire
,
as
the
best
substitute
for
an
oven
.
 
<EOS>
For
Silas
would
not
consent
to
have
a
grate
and
oven
added
to
his
conveniences
:
he
loved
the
old
brick
hearth
as
he
had
loved
his
brown
pot
 
and
was
it
not
there
when
he
had
found
Eppie
?
 
<EOS>
The
gods
of
the
hearth
exist
for
us
still
;
and
let
all
new
faith
be
tolerant
of
that
fetishism
,
lest
it
bruise
its
own
roots
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
ate
his
dinner
more
silently
than
usual
,
soon
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
watching
half
-
abstractedly
Eppie
's
play
with
Snap
and
the
cat
,
by
which
her
own
dining
was
made
rather
a
lengthy
business
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
a
sight
that
might
well
arrest
wandering
thoughts
:
Eppie
,
with
the
rippling
radiance
of
her
hair
and
the
whiteness
of
her
rounded
chin
and
throat
set
off
by
the
dark
-
blue
cotton
gown
,
laughing
merrily
as
the
kitten
held
on
with
her
four
claws
to
one
shoulder
,
like
a
design
for
a
jug
-
handle
,
while
Snap
on
the
right
hand
and
Puss
on
the
other
put
up
their
paws
towards
a
morsel
which
she
held
out
of
the
reach
of
both
 
Snap
occasionally
desisting
in
order
to
remonstrate
with
the
cat
by
a
cogent
worrying
growl
on
the
greediness
and
futility
of
her
conduct
;
till
Eppie
relented
,
caressed
them
both
,
and
divided
the
morsel
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
last
Eppie
,
glancing
at
the
clock
,
checked
the
play
,
and
said
,
"
O
daddy
,
you
're
wanting
to
go
into
the
sunshine
to
smoke
your
pipe
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
clear
away
first
,
so
as
the
house
may
be
tidy
when
godmother
comes
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
make
haste
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
had
taken
to
smoking
a
pipe
daily
during
the
last
two
years
,
having
been
strongly
urged
to
it
by
the
sages
of
Raveloe
,
as
a
practice
"
good
for
the
fits
"
;
and
this
advice
was
sanctioned
by
Dr.
Kimble
,
on
the
ground
that
it
was
as
well
to
try
what
could
do
no
harm
 
a
principle
which
was
made
to
answer
for
a
great
deal
of
work
in
that
gentleman
's
medical
practice
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
did
not
highly
enjoy
smoking
,
and
often
wondered
how
his
neighbours
could
be
so
fond
of
it
;
but
a
humble
sort
of
acquiescence
in
what
was
held
to
be
good
,
had
become
a
strong
habit
of
that
new
self
which
had
been
developed
in
him
since
he
had
found
Eppie
on
his
hearth
:
it
had
been
the
only
clew
his
bewildered
mind
could
hold
by
in
cherishing
this
young
life
that
had
been
sent
to
him
out
of
the
darkness
into
which
his
gold
had
departed
.
 
<EOS>
By
seeking
what
was
needful
for
Eppie
,
by
sharing
the
effect
that
everything
produced
on
her
,
he
had
himself
come
to
appropriate
the
forms
of
custom
and
belief
which
were
the
mould
of
Raveloe
life
;
and
as
,
with
reawakening
sensibilities
,
memory
also
reawakened
,
he
had
begun
to
ponder
over
the
elements
of
his
old
faith
,
and
blend
them
with
his
new
impressions
,
till
he
recovered
a
consciousness
of
unity
between
his
past
and
present
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
presiding
goodness
and
the
human
trust
which
come
with
all
pure
peace
and
joy
,
had
given
him
a
dim
impression
that
there
had
been
some
error
,
some
mistake
,
which
had
thrown
that
dark
shadow
over
the
days
of
his
best
years
;
and
as
it
grew
more
and
more
easy
to
him
to
open
his
mind
to
Dolly
Winthrop
,
he
gradually
communicated
to
her
all
he
could
describe
of
his
early
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
communication
was
necessarily
a
slow
and
difficult
process
,
for
Silas
's
meagre
power
of
explanation
was
not
aided
by
any
readiness
of
interpretation
in
Dolly
,
whose
narrow
outward
experience
gave
her
no
key
to
strange
customs
,
and
made
every
novelty
a
source
of
wonder
that
arrested
them
at
every
step
of
the
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
by
fragments
,
and
at
intervals
which
left
Dolly
time
to
revolve
what
she
had
heard
till
it
acquired
some
familiarity
for
her
,
that
Silas
at
last
arrived
at
the
climax
of
the
sad
story
 
the
drawing
of
lots
,
and
its
false
testimony
concerning
him
;
and
this
had
to
be
repeated
in
several
interviews
,
under
new
questions
on
her
part
as
to
the
nature
of
this
plan
for
detecting
the
guilty
and
clearing
the
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yourn
's
the
same
Bible
<EOS>
,
you
're
sure
<EOS>
o
'
that
,
Master
Marner
 
the
Bible
as
you
brought
wi
'
you
from
that
country
 
<EOS>
it
's
the
same
as
what
they
've
got
at
church
,
and
what
Eppie
's
a
-
learning
to
read
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Silas
,
"
every
bit
the
same
;
and
there
's
drawing
o
'
lots
in
the
Bible
,
mind
you
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
dear
,
"
said
Dolly
in
a
grieved
voice
,
as
if
she
were
hearing
an
unfavourable
report
of
a
sick
man
's
case
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
silent
for
some
minutes
;
at
last
she
said
    
"
There
's
wise
folks
,
happen
,
as
know
how
it
all
is
;
the
parson
knows
,
I
'll
be
bound
;
but
it
takes
big
words
to
tell
them
things
,
and
such
as
poor
folks
ca
n't
make
much
out
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
never
rightly
know
the
meaning
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
what
I
hear
at
church
,
only
a
bit
here
and
there
,
but
I
know
it
's
good
words
 
<EOS>
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
lies
upo
'
your
mind
 
<EOS>
it
's
this
,
Master
Marner
:
<EOS>
as
,
if
Them
above
had
done
the
right
thing
by
you
,
They
'd
never
ha
'
let
you
be
turned
out
for
a
wicked
thief
when
you
was
innicent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
,
who
had
now
come
to
understand
Dolly
's
phraseology
,
"
that
was
what
fell
on
me
like
as
if
it
had
been
red
-
hot
iron
;
because
,
you
see
,
there
was
nobody
as
cared
for
me
or
clave
to
me
above
nor
below
.
 
<EOS>
And
him
as
I
'd
gone
out
and
in
wi
'
for
ten
year
and
more
,
since
when
we
was
lads
and
went
halves
 
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
I
trusted
,
had
lifted
up
his
heel
again
'
me
,
and
worked
to
ruin
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eh
,
but
he
was
a
bad
un
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
as
there
's
another
such
,
"
said
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
'm
o'ercome
,
Master
Marner
;
I
'm
like
as
if
I
'd
waked
and
did
n't
know
whether
it
was
night
or
morning
.
<EOS>
I
feel
somehow
as
sure
as
I
do
when
I
've
laid
something
up
though
I
ca
n't
justly
put
my
hand
on
it
,
as
there
was
a
rights
in
what
happened
to
you
,
if
one
could
but
make
it
out
;
and
you
'd
no
call
to
lose
heart
as
you
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
'll
talk
on
it
again
;
for
sometimes
things
come
into
my
head
when
I
'm
leeching
or
poulticing
,
or
such
,
as
I
could
never
think
on
when
I
was
sitting
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
was
too
useful
a
woman
not
to
have
many
opportunities
of
illumination
of
the
kind
she
alluded
to
,
and
she
was
not
long
before
she
recurred
to
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
Marner
,
"
she
said
,
one
day
that
she
came
to
bring
home
Eppie
's
washing
,
"
I
've
been
sore
puzzled
for
a
good
bit
wi
'
<EOS>
that
trouble
<EOS>
o
'
yourn
and
the
drawing
o
'
lots
;
and
it
got
twisted
back'ards
and
for'ards
,
as
I
did
n't
know
<EOS>
which
end
to
lay
hold
on
.
<EOS>
But
it
come
to
me
all
clear
like
,
that
night
when
I
was
sitting
up
wi
'
poor
Bessy
Fawkes
,
as
is
dead
and
left
her
children
behind
<EOS>
,
God
help
'em
 
<EOS>
it
come
to
me
as
clear
as
daylight
;
but
whether
I
've
got
hold
on
it
now
,
or
can
anyways
bring
it
to
my
tongue
's
end
,
that
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
've
often
a
deal
inside
me
as'll
never
come
out
;
and
for
what
you
talk
<EOS>
o
'
your
folks
in
your
old
country
niver
saying
prayers
by
heart
nor
saying
'em
out
of
a
book
<EOS>
,
they
must
be
wonderful
cliver
;
for
if
I
did
n't
know
"
Our
Father
"
,
and
little
bits
o
'
good
words
as
I
can
carry
out
o
'
church
wi
'
me
,
I
might
down
o
'
my
knees
every
night
,
but
nothing
could
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
can
mostly
say
something
as
I
can
make
sense
on
,
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
"
said
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
Master
Marner
,
it
come
to
me
summat
like
this
:
I
can
make
nothing
<EOS>
o
'
the
drawing
o
'
lots
and
the
answer
coming
wrong
;
it
'
ud
mayhap
take
the
parson
to
tell
that
,
and
he
could
only
tell
us
i
'
big
words
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
come
to
me
as
clear
as
the
daylight
,
it
was
when
I
was
troubling
over
poor
Bessy
Fawkes
,
and
it
allays
comes
into
my
head
when
I
'm
sorry
for
folks
,
and
feel
as
I
ca
n't
do
a
power
to
help
'em
,
not
if
I
was
to
get
up
<EOS>
i
'
the
middle
o
'
<EOS>
the
night
 
<EOS>
it
comes
into
my
head
as
Them
above
<EOS>
has
got
a
deal
tenderer
heart
nor
<EOS>
what
I
've
got
 
for
I
ca
n't
be
anyways
better
nor
Them
as
made
me
;
and
if
anything
looks
hard
to
me
,
it
's
because
there
's
things
I
do
n't
know
on
;
and
for
the
matter
o
<EOS>
'
that
,
there
may
be
plenty
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
things
I
do
n't
know
on
,
<EOS>
for
it
's
little
as
I
know
 
that
it
is
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
while
I
was
thinking
o
'
that
,
you
come
into
my
mind
,
Master
Marner
,
and
it
all
come
pouring
in
:
 
if
_
<EOS>
I
_
felt
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
my
inside
<EOS>
what
was
the
right
and
just
thing
by
you
,
and
them
as
prayed
and
drawed
the
lots
,
<EOS>
all
but
that
wicked
un
,
if
_
they_'d
ha
'
done
the
right
thing
by
you
if
they
could
,
is
n't
there
Them
as
was
at
the
making
on
us
,
and
knows
better
and
has
a
better
will
?
 
<EOS>
And
that
's
all
as
ever
<EOS>
I
can
be
sure
on
,
and
everything
else
is
a
big
puzzle
to
me
when
I
think
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
there
was
the
fever
come
and
took
off
them
as
were
full
-
growed
,
and
left
the
helpless
children
;
and
there
's
the
breaking
o
'
limbs
;
and
them
as
'
ud
do
right
and
be
sober
have
to
suffer
by
them
as
are
contrairy
 
<EOS>
eh
,
there
's
trouble
<EOS>
i
'
this
world
,
and
there
's
things
as
we
can
niver
make
out
the
rights
on
.
<EOS>
And
all
as
we
've
got
to
do
is
to
trusten
,
Master
Marner
 
<EOS>
to
do
the
right
thing
as
fur
as
we
know
,
and
to
trusten
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
us
as
knows
so
little
can
see
a
bit
o
'
good
and
rights
,
we
may
be
sure
as
there
's
a
good
and
a
rights
bigger
nor
<EOS>
what
we
can
know
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
my
own
inside
as
it
must
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
could
but
ha
'
gone
on
trustening
,
Master
Marner
,
you
would
n't
ha
'
run
away
from
your
fellow
-
creaturs
and
been
so
lone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
but
that
'
ud
ha
'
been
hard
,
"
said
Silas
,
in
an
under
-
tone
;
"
it
'
<EOS>
ud
ha
'
been
hard
to
trusten
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
so
it
would
,
"
said
Dolly
,
almost
with
compunction
;
"
them
<EOS>
things
are
easier
said
nor
done
;
and
I
'm
partly
ashamed
o
'
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
Silas
,
"
you
're
i
'
the
right
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Winthrop
 
you
're
i
'
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
good
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
this
world
 
<EOS>
I
've
a
feeling
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
that
now
;
and
it
makes
a
man
feel
as
there
's
a
good
more
nor
he
can
see
<EOS>
,
i
'
spite
o
'
the
trouble
and
the
wickedness
.
 
<EOS>
That
drawing
o
'
the
lots
is
dark
;
but
the
child
was
sent
to
me
:
there
's
dealings
with
us
 
<EOS>
there
's
dealings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
dialogue
took
place
in
Eppie
's
earlier
years
,
when
Silas
had
to
part
with
her
for
two
hours
every
day
,
that
she
might
learn
to
read
at
the
dame
school
,
after
he
had
vainly
tried
himself
to
guide
her
in
that
first
step
to
learning
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
she
was
grown
up
,
Silas
had
often
been
led
,
in
those
moments
of
quiet
outpouring
which
come
to
people
who
live
together
in
perfect
love
,
to
talk
with
_
<EOS>
her
_
<EOS>
too
of
the
past
,
and
how
and
why
he
had
lived
a
lonely
man
until
she
had
been
sent
to
him
.
<EOS>
For
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
hide
from
Eppie
that
she
was
not
his
own
child
:
even
if
the
most
delicate
reticence
on
the
point
could
have
been
expected
from
Raveloe
gossips
in
her
presence
,
her
own
questions
about
her
mother
could
not
have
been
parried
,
as
she
grew
up
,
without
that
complete
shrouding
of
the
past
which
would
have
made
a
painful
barrier
between
their
minds
.
<EOS>
So
Eppie
had
long
known
how
her
mother
had
died
on
the
snowy
ground
,
and
how
she
herself
had
been
found
on
the
hearth
by
father
Silas
,
who
had
taken
her
golden
curls
for
his
lost
guineas
brought
back
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
tender
and
peculiar
love
with
which
Silas
had
reared
her
in
almost
inseparable
companionship
with
himself
,
aided
by
the
seclusion
of
their
dwelling
,
had
preserved
her
from
the
lowering
influences
of
the
village
talk
and
habits
,
and
had
kept
her
mind
in
that
freshness
which
is
sometimes
falsely
supposed
to
be
an
invariable
attribute
of
rusticity
.
 
<EOS>
Perfect
love
has
a
breath
of
poetry
which
can
exalt
the
relations
of
the
least
-
instructed
human
beings
;
and
this
breath
of
poetry
had
surrounded
Eppie
from
the
time
when
she
had
followed
the
bright
gleam
that
beckoned
her
to
Silas
's
hearth
;
so
that
it
is
not
surprising
if
,
in
other
things
besides
her
delicate
prettiness
,
she
was
not
quite
a
common
village
maiden
,
but
had
a
touch
of
refinement
and
fervour
which
came
from
no
other
teaching
than
that
of
tenderly
-
nurtured
unvitiated
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
too
childish
and
simple
for
her
imagination
to
rove
into
questions
about
her
unknown
father
;
for
a
long
while
it
did
not
even
occur
to
her
that
she
must
have
had
a
father
;
and
the
first
time
that
the
idea
of
her
mother
having
had
a
husband
presented
itself
to
her
,
was
when
Silas
showed
her
the
wedding
-
ring
which
had
been
taken
from
the
wasted
finger
,
and
had
been
carefully
preserved
by
him
in
a
little
lackered
box
shaped
like
a
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
He
delivered
this
box
into
Eppie
's
charge
when
she
had
grown
up
,
and
she
often
opened
it
to
look
at
the
ring
:
but
still
she
thought
hardly
at
all
about
the
father
of
whom
it
was
the
symbol
.
 
<EOS>
Had
she
not
a
father
very
close
to
her
,
who
loved
her
better
than
any
real
fathers
in
the
village
seemed
to
love
their
daughters
?
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
who
her
mother
was
,
and
how
she
came
to
die
in
that
forlornness
,
were
questions
that
often
pressed
on
Eppie
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Her
knowledge
of
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
who
was
her
nearest
friend
next
to
Silas
,
made
her
feel
that
a
mother
must
be
very
precious
;
and
she
had
again
and
again
asked
Silas
to
tell
her
how
her
mother
looked
,
whom
she
was
like
,
and
how
he
had
found
her
against
the
furze
bush
,
led
towards
it
by
the
little
footsteps
and
the
outstretched
arms
.
 
<EOS>
The
furze
bush
was
there
still
;
and
this
afternoon
,
when
Eppie
came
out
with
Silas
into
the
sunshine
,
it
was
the
first
object
that
arrested
her
eyes
and
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
tone
of
gentle
gravity
,
which
sometimes
came
like
a
sadder
,
slower
cadence
across
her
playfulness
,
"
we
shall
take
the
furze
bush
into
the
garden
;
it
'll
come
into
the
corner
,
and
just
against
it
I
'll
put
snowdrops
and
crocuses
,
'cause
Aaron
says
they
wo
n't
die
out
,
but'll
always
get
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
child
,
"
said
Silas
,
always
ready
to
talk
when
he
had
his
pipe
in
his
hand
,
apparently
enjoying
the
pauses
more
than
the
puffs
,
"
it
would
n't
do
to
leave
out
the
furze
bush
;
and
there
's
nothing
prettier
,
to
my
thinking
,
when
it
's
yallow
with
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
just
come
into
my
head
what
we
're
to
do
for
a
fence
 
<EOS>
mayhap
Aaron
can
help
us
to
a
thought
;
but
a
fence
we
must
have
,
else
the
donkeys
and
things
'
ull
come
and
trample
everything
down
.
 
<EOS>
And
fencing
's
hard
to
be
got
at
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
daddy
,
"
said
Eppie
,
clasping
her
hands
suddenly
,
after
a
minute
's
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
<EOS>
lots
o
'
loose
stones
about
,
some
of
'em
not
big
,
<EOS>
and
we
might
lay
'em
atop
of
one
another
,
and
make
a
wall
.
<EOS>
You
and
me
could
carry
the
smallest
,
and
Aaron
'
ud
carry
the
rest
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
my
precious
un
,
"
said
Silas
,
"
there
is
n't
enough
stones
to
go
all
round
;
and
as
for
you
carrying
,
why
,
wi
'
your
little
arms
you
could
n't
carry
a
stone
no
bigger
than
a
turnip
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
dillicate
made
,
my
dear
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
tender
intonation
 
<EOS>
"
that
's
what
Mrs.
Winthrop
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'm
stronger
than
you
think
,
daddy
,
"
said
Eppie
;
"
and
if
there
was
n't
stones
enough
to
go
all
round
,
why
they
'll
go
<EOS>
part
o
'
the
way
,
<EOS>
and
then
it
'll
be
easier
to
get
sticks
and
things
for
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
See
here
,
round
the
big
pit
,
what
a
many
stones
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
skipped
forward
to
the
pit
,
meaning
to
lift
one
of
the
stones
and
exhibit
her
strength
,
but
she
started
back
in
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
father
,
just
come
and
look
here
,
"
she
exclaimed
 
"
come
and
see
how
the
water
's
gone
down
since
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
yesterday
the
pit
was
ever
so
full
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Silas
,
coming
to
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
's
the
draining
they
've
begun
on
,
since
harvest
,
i
'
<EOS>
Mr.
Osgood
's
fields
,
I
reckon
.
 
<EOS>
The
foreman
said
to
me
the
other
day
,
when
I
passed
by
'em
,
"
Master
Marner
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
should
n't
wonder
if
we
lay
your
bit
o
'
waste
as
dry
as
a
bone
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
<EOS>
,
he
said
,
had
gone
into
the
draining
:
he
'd
been
taking
these
fields
<EOS>
o
'
Mr.
Osgood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
odd
it
'll
seem
to
have
the
old
pit
dried
up
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Eppie
,
turning
away
,
and
stooping
to
lift
rather
a
large
stone
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
,
daddy
,
I
can
carry
this
quite
well
,
"
she
said
,
going
along
with
much
energy
for
a
few
steps
,
but
presently
letting
it
fall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
're
fine
and
strong
,
are
n't
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
,
while
Eppie
shook
her
aching
arms
and
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
let
us
go
and
sit
down
on
the
bank
against
the
stile
there
,
and
have
no
more
lifting
.
<EOS>
You
might
hurt
yourself
,
child
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
need
have
somebody
to
work
for
you
 
and
my
arm
is
n't
over
strong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
uttered
the
last
sentence
slowly
,
as
if
it
implied
more
than
met
the
ear
;
and
Eppie
,
when
they
sat
down
on
the
bank
,
nestled
close
to
his
side
,
and
,
taking
hold
caressingly
of
the
arm
that
was
not
over
strong
,
held
it
on
her
lap
,
while
Silas
puffed
again
dutifully
at
the
pipe
,
which
occupied
his
other
arm
.
 
<EOS>
An
ash
in
the
hedgerow
behind
made
a
fretted
screen
from
the
sun
,
and
threw
happy
playful
shadows
all
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
Eppie
,
very
gently
,
after
they
had
been
sitting
in
silence
a
little
while
,
"
if
I
was
to
be
married
,
ought
I
to
be
married
with
my
mother
's
ring
?
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
gave
an
almost
imperceptible
start
,
though
the
question
fell
in
with
the
under
-
current
of
thought
in
his
own
mind
,
and
then
said
,
in
a
subdued
tone
,
"
Why
,
Eppie
,
have
you
been
a
-
thinking
on
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
this
last
week
,
father
,
"
said
Eppie
,
ingenuously
,
"
since
Aaron
talked
to
me
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
,
still
in
the
same
subdued
way
,
as
if
he
were
anxious
lest
he
should
fall
into
the
slightest
tone
that
was
not
for
Eppie
's
good
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
he
should
like
to
be
married
,
because
he
was
a
-
going
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
had
got
a
deal
of
gardening
work
,
now
Mr.
Mott
's
given
up
;
and
he
goes
twice
a
-
week
regular
to
Mr.
Cass
's
,
and
once
to
Mr.
Osgood
's
,
and
they
're
going
to
take
him
on
at
the
Rectory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
it
as
he
's
wanting
to
marry
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
,
with
rather
a
sad
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
me
,
to
be
sure
,
daddy
,
"
said
Eppie
,
with
dimpling
laughter
,
kissing
her
father
's
cheek
;
"
as
if
he
'd
want
to
marry
anybody
else
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
mean
to
have
him
,
do
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
some
time
,
"
said
Eppie
,
"
I
do
n't
know
when
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
's
married
some
time
,
Aaron
says
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
told
him
that
was
n't
true
:
for
,
I
said
,
look
at
father
 
<EOS>
he
's
never
been
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
child
,
"
said
Silas
,
"
your
father
was
a
lone
man
till
you
was
sent
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
never
be
lone
again
,
father
,
"
said
Eppie
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
what
Aaron
said
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
never
think
o
'
taking
you
away
from
Master
Marner
,
Eppie
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
"
It
'
ud
be
no
use
if
you
did
,
Aaron
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
wants
us
all
to
live
together
,
so
as
you
need
n't
work
a
bit
,
father
,
only
what
's
for
your
own
pleasure
;
and
he
'd
be
as
good
as
a
son
to
you
 
<EOS>
that
was
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
should
you
like
that
,
Eppie
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
,
looking
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
mind
it
,
father
,
"
said
Eppie
,
quite
simply
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
should
like
things
to
be
so
as
you
need
n't
work
much
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
it
was
n't
for
that
,
I
'd
sooner
things
did
n't
change
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
happy
:
I
like
Aaron
to
be
fond
of
me
,
and
come
and
see
us
often
,
and
behave
pretty
to
you
 
he
always
_
<EOS>
does
_
behave
pretty
to
you
,
does
n't
he
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
child
,
nobody
could
behave
better
,
"
said
Silas
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
his
mother
's
lad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
want
any
change
,
"
said
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
go
on
a
long
,
long
while
,
just
as
we
are
.
 
<EOS>
Only
Aaron
does
want
a
change
;
and
he
made
me
cry
a
bit
 
only
a
bit
 
because
he
said
I
did
n't
care
for
him
,
for
if
I
cared
for
him
I
should
want
us
to
be
married
,
as
he
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
my
blessed
child
,
"
said
Silas
,
laying
down
his
pipe
as
if
it
were
useless
to
pretend
to
smoke
any
longer
,
"
you
're
o'er
young
to
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
ask
Mrs.
<EOS>
Winthrop
 
we
'll
ask
Aaron
's
mother
<EOS>
what
_
<EOS>
she
_
thinks
:
if
there
's
a
right
thing
to
do
,
she
'll
come
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
's
this
to
be
thought
on
,
Eppie
:
things
_
<EOS>
will
_
change
,
whether
we
like
it
or
no
<EOS>
;
things
wo
n't
go
on
for
a
long
while
just
as
they
are
and
no
difference
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
get
older
and
helplesser
,
and
be
a
burden
on
you
,
belike
,
if
I
do
n't
go
away
from
you
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
Not
as
I
mean
you
'd
think
me
a
burden
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
would
n't
 
<EOS>
but
it
'
ud
be
hard
upon
you
;
and
when
I
look
for'ard
to
that
,
I
like
to
think
as
you
'd
have
somebody
else
besides
me
 
somebody
young
and
strong
<EOS>
,
as'll
outlast
your
own
life
,
and
take
care
on
you
to
the
end
.
"
 
<EOS>
Silas
paused
,
and
,
resting
his
wrists
on
his
knees
,
lifted
his
hands
up
and
down
meditatively
as
he
looked
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
would
you
like
me
to
be
married
,
father
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Eppie
,
with
a
little
trembling
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
be
the
man
to
say
no
,
Eppie
,
"
said
Silas
,
emphatically
;
"
but
we
'll
ask
your
godmother
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
wish
the
right
thing
by
you
and
her
son
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
they
come
,
then
,
"
said
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
and
meet
'em
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
pipe
!
 
<EOS>
wo
n't
you
have
it
lit
again
,
father
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Eppie
,
lifting
that
medicinal
appliance
from
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
child
,
"
said
Silas
,
"
I
've
done
enough
for
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
mayhap
,
a
little
of
it
does
me
more
good
than
so
much
at
once
.
"
    
<EOS>
While
Silas
and
Eppie
were
seated
on
the
bank
discoursing
in
the
fleckered
shade
of
the
ash
tree
,
Miss
Priscilla
Lammeter
was
resisting
her
sister
's
arguments
,
that
it
would
be
better
to
take
tea
at
the
Red
House
,
and
let
her
father
have
a
long
nap
,
than
drive
home
to
the
Warrens
so
soon
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
party
(
of
four
only
)
were
seated
round
the
table
in
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
,
with
the
Sunday
dessert
before
them
,
of
fresh
filberts
,
apples
,
and
pears
,
duly
ornamented
with
leaves
by
Nancy
's
own
hand
before
the
bells
had
rung
for
church
.
  
<EOS>
A
great
change
has
come
over
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
since
we
saw
it
in
Godfrey
's
bachelor
days
,
and
under
the
wifeless
reign
of
the
old
Squire
.
 
<EOS>
Now
all
is
polish
,
on
which
no
yesterday
's
dust
is
ever
allowed
to
rest
,
from
the
yard
's
width
of
oaken
boards
round
the
carpet
,
to
the
old
Squire
's
gun
and
whips
and
walking
-
sticks
,
ranged
on
the
stag
's
antlers
above
the
mantelpiece
.
 
<EOS>
All
other
signs
of
sporting
and
outdoor
occupation
Nancy
has
removed
to
another
room
;
but
she
has
brought
into
the
Red
House
the
habit
of
filial
reverence
,
and
preserves
sacredly
in
a
place
of
honour
these
relics
of
her
husband
's
departed
father
.
 
<EOS>
The
tankards
are
on
the
side
-
table
still
,
but
the
bossed
silver
is
undimmed
by
handling
,
and
there
are
no
dregs
to
send
forth
unpleasant
suggestions
:
the
only
prevailing
scent
is
of
the
lavender
and
rose
-
leaves
that
fill
the
vases
of
Derbyshire
spar
.
 
<EOS>
All
is
purity
and
order
in
this
once
dreary
room
,
for
,
fifteen
years
ago
,
it
was
entered
by
a
new
presiding
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
father
,
"
said
Nancy
,
"
_
is
_
there
any
call
for
you
to
go
home
to
tea
?
 
<EOS>
May
n't
you
just
as
well
stay
with
us
?
 
<EOS>
such
a
beautiful
evening
as
it
's
likely
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
had
been
talking
with
Godfrey
about
the
increasing
poor
-
rate
and
the
ruinous
times
,
and
had
not
heard
the
dialogue
between
his
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
must
ask
Priscilla
,
"
he
said
,
in
the
once
firm
voice
,
now
become
rather
broken
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
manages
me
and
the
farm
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
reason
good
as
I
should
manage
you
,
father
,
"
said
Priscilla
,
"
else
you
'd
be
giving
yourself
your
death
with
rheumatism
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
farm
,
if
anything
turns
out
wrong
,
as
it
ca
n't
but
do
in
these
times
,
there
's
nothing
kills
a
man
so
soon
as
having
nobody
to
find
fault
with
but
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
deal
the
best
way
o
'
being
master
,
to
let
somebody
else
do
the
ordering
,
and
keep
the
blaming
in
your
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
It
'
ud
save
many
a
man
a
stroke
,
_
I
_
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
her
father
,
with
a
quiet
laugh
,
"
<EOS>
I
did
n't
say
you
do
n't
manage
for
everybody
's
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
manage
so
as
you
may
stay
tea
,
Priscilla
,
"
said
Nancy
,
putting
her
hand
on
her
sister
's
arm
affectionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
now
;
and
we
'll
go
round
the
garden
while
father
has
his
nap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
he
'll
have
a
beautiful
nap
in
the
gig
,
for
I
shall
drive
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
for
staying
tea
,
I
ca
n't
hear
of
it
;
for
there
's
this
<EOS>
dairymaid
<EOS>
,
now
she
knows
she
's
to
be
married
,
turned
Michaelmas
,
she
'd
as
lief
pour
the
new
milk
into
the
pig
-
trough
as
into
the
pans
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
with
'em
all
<EOS>
:
it
's
as
if
they
thought
the
world
'
ud
be
new
-
made
because
they
're
to
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
So
come
and
let
me
put
my
bonnet
on
,
and
there
'll
be
time
for
us
to
walk
round
the
garden
while
the
horse
is
being
put
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
sisters
were
treading
the
neatly
-
swept
garden
-
walks
,
between
the
bright
turf
that
contrasted
pleasantly
with
the
dark
cones
and
arches
and
wall
-
like
hedges
of
yew
,
Priscilla
said
    
"
I
'm
as
glad
as
anything
at
your
husband
's
making
that
exchange
o
'
land
with
cousin
Osgood
,
and
beginning
the
dairying
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
thousand
pities
you
did
n't
do
it
before
;
for
it
'll
give
you
something
to
fill
your
mind
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
like
a
dairy
if
folks
want
a
bit
o
'
worrit
to
make
the
days
pass
.
 
<EOS>
For
as
for
rubbing
furniture
,
when
you
can
once
see
your
face
in
a
table
there
's
nothing
else
to
look
for
;
but
there
's
always
something
fresh
with
the
dairy
;
for
even
in
the
depths
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
winter
there
's
some
pleasure
in
conquering
the
butter
,
and
making
it
come
whether
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
added
Priscilla
,
pressing
her
sister
's
hand
affectionately
as
they
walked
side
by
side
<EOS>
,
"
you
'll
never
be
low
when
you
've
got
a
dairy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Priscilla
,
"
said
Nancy
,
returning
the
pressure
with
a
grateful
glance
of
her
clear
eyes
,
"
but
it
wo
n't
make
up
to
Godfrey
:
<EOS>
a
dairy
's
not
so
much
to
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
only
what
he
cares
for
that
ever
makes
me
low
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
contented
with
the
blessings
we
have
,
if
he
could
be
contented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
drives
me
past
patience
,
"
said
Priscilla
,
impetuously
,
"
<EOS>
that
way
o
'
the
men
 
always
wanting
and
wanting
,
and
never
easy
with
what
they
've
got
:
they
ca
n't
sit
comfortable
in
their
chairs
when
they
've
neither
ache
nor
pain
,
but
either
they
must
stick
a
pipe
in
their
mouths
,
to
make
'em
better
than
well
,
or
else
they
must
be
swallowing
something
strong
,
though
they
're
forced
to
make
haste
before
the
next
meal
comes
in
.
 
<EOS>
But
joyful
be
it
spoken
,
our
father
was
never
that
sort
o
'
man
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
had
pleased
God
to
make
you
ugly
,
like
me
,
so
as
the
men
would
n't
ha
'
run
after
you
,
we
might
have
kept
to
our
own
family
,
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
folks
as
have
got
uneasy
blood
in
their
veins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
say
so
,
Priscilla
,
"
said
Nancy
,
repenting
that
she
had
called
forth
this
outburst
;
"
nobody
has
any
occasion
to
find
fault
with
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
natural
he
should
be
disappointed
at
not
having
any
children
:
every
man
likes
to
have
somebody
to
work
for
and
lay
by
for
,
and
he
always
counted
so
on
making
a
fuss
with
'em
when
they
were
little
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
many
another
man
'
ud
hanker
more
than
he
does
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
best
of
husbands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
know
,
"
said
Priscilla
,
smiling
sarcastically
,
"
I
know
the
way
<EOS>
o
'
wives
<EOS>
;
they
set
one
on
to
abuse
their
husbands
,
and
then
they
turn
round
on
one
and
praise
'em
as
if
they
wanted
to
sell
'em
.
 
<EOS>
But
father'll
be
waiting
for
me
;
we
must
turn
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
large
gig
with
the
steady
old
grey
was
at
the
front
door
,
and
Mr.
Lammeter
was
already
on
the
stone
steps
,
passing
the
time
in
recalling
to
Godfrey
<EOS>
what
very
fine
points
Speckle
had
when
his
master
used
to
ride
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
_
would
_
have
a
good
horse
,
you
know
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
not
liking
that
spirited
time
to
be
quite
effaced
from
the
memory
of
his
juniors
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
bring
Nancy
to
the
Warrens
before
the
week
's
out
,
Mr.
Cass
,
"
was
Priscilla
's
parting
injunction
,
as
she
took
the
reins
,
and
shook
them
gently
,
by
way
of
friendly
incitement
to
Speckle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
just
take
a
turn
to
the
fields
against
the
Stone
-
pits
,
Nancy
,
and
look
at
the
draining
,
"
said
Godfrey
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
in
again
by
tea
-
time
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
shall
be
back
in
an
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
Godfrey
's
custom
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
to
do
a
little
contemplative
farming
in
a
leisurely
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
seldom
accompanied
him
;
for
the
women
of
her
generation
 
unless
,
like
Priscilla
,
they
took
to
outdoor
management
 
were
not
given
to
much
walking
beyond
their
own
house
and
garden
,
finding
sufficient
exercise
in
domestic
duties
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
when
Priscilla
was
not
with
her
,
she
usually
sat
with
Mant
's
Bible
before
her
,
and
after
following
the
text
with
her
eyes
for
a
little
while
,
she
would
gradually
permit
them
to
wander
as
her
thoughts
had
already
insisted
on
wandering
.
  
<EOS>
But
Nancy
's
Sunday
thoughts
were
rarely
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
devout
and
reverential
intention
implied
by
the
book
<EOS>
spread
open
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
theologically
instructed
enough
to
discern
very
clearly
the
relation
between
the
sacred
documents
of
the
past
which
she
opened
without
method
,
and
her
own
obscure
,
simple
life
;
but
the
spirit
of
rectitude
,
and
the
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
effect
of
her
conduct
on
others
,
which
were
strong
elements
in
Nancy
's
character
,
had
made
it
a
habit
with
her
to
scrutinize
her
past
feelings
and
actions
with
self
-
questioning
solicitude
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mind
not
being
courted
by
a
great
variety
of
subjects
,
she
filled
the
vacant
moments
by
living
inwardly
,
again
and
again
,
through
all
her
remembered
experience
,
especially
through
the
fifteen
years
of
her
married
time
,
in
which
her
life
and
its
significance
had
been
doubled
.
 
<EOS>
She
recalled
the
small
details
,
the
words
,
tones
,
and
looks
,
in
the
critical
scenes
which
had
opened
a
new
epoch
for
her
by
giving
her
a
deeper
insight
into
the
relations
and
trials
of
life
,
or
which
had
called
on
her
for
some
little
effort
of
forbearance
,
or
of
painful
adherence
to
an
imagined
or
real
duty
 
asking
herself
continually
whether
she
had
been
in
any
respect
blamable
.
 
<EOS>
This
excessive
rumination
and
self
-
questioning
is
perhaps
a
morbid
habit
inevitable
to
a
mind
of
much
moral
sensibility
when
shut
out
from
its
due
share
of
outward
activity
and
of
practical
claims
on
its
affections
 
inevitable
to
a
noble
-
hearted
,
childless
woman
,
when
her
lot
is
narrow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
so
little
 
<EOS>
have
I
done
it
all
well
?
<EOS>
"
 
is
the
perpetually
recurring
thought
;
and
there
are
no
voices
calling
her
away
from
that
soliloquy
,
no
peremptory
demands
to
divert
energy
from
vain
regret
or
superfluous
scruple
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
main
thread
of
painful
experience
in
Nancy
's
married
life
,
and
on
it
hung
certain
deeply
-
felt
scenes
,
which
were
the
oftenest
revived
in
retrospect
.
 
<EOS>
The
short
dialogue
with
Priscilla
in
the
garden
had
determined
the
current
of
retrospect
in
that
frequent
direction
this
particular
Sunday
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
wandering
of
her
thought
from
the
text
,
which
she
still
attempted
dutifully
to
follow
with
her
eyes
and
silent
lips
,
was
into
an
imaginary
enlargement
of
the
defence
she
had
set
up
for
her
husband
against
Priscilla
's
implied
blame
.
 
<EOS>
The
vindication
of
the
loved
object
is
the
best
balm
affection
can
find
for
its
wounds
:
 
<EOS>
"
A
man
must
have
so
much
on
his
mind
,
"
is
the
belief
by
which
a
wife
often
supports
a
cheerful
face
under
rough
answers
and
unfeeling
words
.
 
<EOS>
And
Nancy
's
deepest
wounds
had
all
come
from
the
perception
that
the
absence
of
children
from
their
hearth
was
dwelt
on
in
her
husband
's
mind
as
a
privation
to
which
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
sweet
Nancy
might
have
been
expected
to
feel
still
more
keenly
the
denial
of
a
blessing
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
with
all
the
varied
expectations
and
preparations
,
solemn
and
prettily
trivial
,
which
fill
the
mind
of
a
loving
woman
when
she
expects
to
become
a
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Was
there
not
a
drawer
filled
with
the
neat
work
of
her
hands
,
all
unworn
and
untouched
,
just
as
she
had
arranged
it
there
fourteen
years
ago
 
just
,
but
for
one
little
dress
,
which
had
been
made
the
burial
-
dress
?
 
<EOS>
But
under
this
immediate
personal
trial
Nancy
was
so
firmly
unmurmuring
,
<EOS>
that
years
ago
she
had
suddenly
renounced
the
habit
of
visiting
this
drawer
,
lest
she
should
in
this
way
be
cherishing
a
longing
for
what
was
not
given
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
this
very
severity
towards
any
indulgence
of
what
she
held
to
be
sinful
regret
in
herself
,
that
made
her
shrink
from
applying
her
own
standard
to
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
different
 
<EOS>
it
is
much
worse
for
a
man
to
be
disappointed
in
that
way
:
a
woman
can
always
be
satisfied
with
devoting
herself
to
her
husband
,
but
a
man
wants
something
that
will
make
him
look
forward
more
 
and
sitting
by
the
fire
is
so
much
duller
to
him
than
to
a
woman
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
always
,
when
Nancy
reached
this
point
in
her
meditations
 
trying
,
with
predetermined
sympathy
,
to
see
everything
as
Godfrey
saw
it
 
there
came
a
renewal
of
self
-
questioning
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Had
_
<EOS>
she
done
everything
in
her
power
to
lighten
Godfrey
's
privation
?
 
<EOS>
Had
she
really
been
right
in
the
resistance
which
had
cost
her
so
much
pain
six
years
ago
,
and
<EOS>
again
four
years
ago
 
the
resistance
to
her
husband
's
wish
that
they
should
adopt
a
child
?
<EOS>
Adoption
was
more
remote
from
the
ideas
and
habits
of
that
time
than
of
our
own
;
still
Nancy
had
her
opinion
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
necessary
to
her
mind
to
have
an
opinion
on
all
topics
,
not
exclusively
masculine
,
that
had
come
under
her
notice
,
as
for
her
to
have
a
precisely
marked
place
for
every
article
of
her
personal
property
:
and
her
opinions
were
always
principles
to
be
unwaveringly
acted
on
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
firm
,
not
because
of
their
basis
,
but
because
she
held
them
with
a
tenacity
inseparable
from
her
mental
action
.
 
<EOS>
On
all
the
duties
and
proprieties
of
life
,
from
filial
behaviour
to
the
arrangements
of
the
evening
toilette
,
pretty
Nancy
Lammeter
,
by
the
time
she
was
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
had
her
unalterable
little
code
,
and
had
formed
every
one
of
her
habits
in
strict
accordance
with
that
code
.
 
<EOS>
She
carried
these
decided
judgments
within
her
in
the
most
unobtrusive
way
:
they
rooted
themselves
in
her
mind
,
and
grew
there
as
quietly
as
grass
.
 
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
we
know
,
she
insisted
on
dressing
like
Priscilla
,
because
"
it
was
right
for
sisters
to
dress
alike
"
,
and
because
"
she
would
do
what
was
right
<EOS>
if
she
wore
a
gown
dyed
with
cheese
-
colouring
"
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
a
trivial
but
typical
instance
of
the
mode
in
which
Nancy
's
life
was
regulated
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
rigid
principles
,
and
no
petty
egoistic
feeling
,
which
had
been
the
ground
of
Nancy
's
difficult
resistance
to
her
husband
's
wish
.
 
<EOS>
To
adopt
a
child
,
because
children
of
your
own
had
been
denied
you
,
was
to
try
and
choose
your
lot
in
spite
of
Providence
:
the
adopted
child
,
she
was
convinced
,
would
never
turn
out
well
,
and
would
be
a
curse
to
those
who
had
wilfully
and
rebelliously
sought
what
it
was
clear
that
,
for
some
high
reason
,
they
were
better
without
.
<EOS>
When
you
saw
a
thing
was
not
meant
to
be
,
said
Nancy
,
it
was
a
bounden
duty
to
leave
off
so
much
as
wishing
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
far
,
perhaps
,
the
wisest
of
men
could
scarcely
make
more
than
a
verbal
improvement
in
her
principle
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
conditions
under
which
she
held
it
apparent
that
a
thing
was
not
meant
to
be
,
depended
on
a
more
peculiar
mode
of
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
given
up
making
a
purchase
at
a
particular
place
if
,
on
three
successive
times
,
rain
,
or
some
other
cause
of
Heaven
's
sending
,
had
formed
an
obstacle
;
and
she
would
have
anticipated
a
broken
limb
or
other
heavy
misfortune
to
any
one
who
persisted
in
spite
of
such
indications
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
you
think
the
child
would
turn
out
ill
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
,
in
his
remonstrances
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
thriven
as
well
as
child
can
do
with
the
weaver
;
and
_
<EOS>
he
_
adopted
her
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
n't
such
a
pretty
little
girl
anywhere
else
in
the
parish
,
or
one
fitter
for
the
station
we
could
give
her
.
 
<EOS>
Where
can
be
the
likelihood
of
her
being
a
curse
to
anybody
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
Godfrey
,
"
said
Nancy
,
who
was
sitting
with
her
hands
tightly
clasped
together
,
and
with
yearning
,
regretful
affection
in
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
child
may
not
turn
out
ill
with
the
weaver
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
then
,
he
did
n't
go
to
seek
her
,
as
we
should
be
doing
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
wrong
:
I
feel
sure
it
will
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
what
that
lady
we
met
at
the
Royston
Baths
told
us
about
the
child
her
sister
adopted
?
<EOS>
That
was
the
only
adopting
I
ever
heard
of
:
and
the
child
was
transported
when
it
was
twenty
-
three
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Godfrey
,
do
n't
ask
me
to
do
what
I
know
is
wrong
:
I
should
never
be
happy
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
's
very
hard
for
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
it
's
easier
for
me
 
<EOS>
but
it
's
the
will
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
might
seem
singular
that
Nancy
 
with
her
religious
theory
pieced
together
out
of
narrow
social
traditions
,
fragments
of
church
doctrine
imperfectly
understood
,
and
girlish
reasonings
on
her
small
experience
 
should
have
arrived
by
herself
at
a
way
of
thinking
so
nearly
akin
to
that
of
many
devout
people
,
whose
beliefs
are
held
in
the
shape
of
a
system
quite
remote
from
her
knowledge
 
<EOS>
singular
,
if
we
did
not
know
that
human
beliefs
,
like
all
other
natural
growths
,
elude
the
barriers
of
system
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
had
from
the
first
specified
Eppie
,
then
about
twelve
years
old
,
as
a
child
suitable
for
them
to
adopt
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
Silas
would
rather
part
with
his
life
than
with
Eppie
.
<EOS>
Surely
the
weaver
would
wish
the
best
to
the
child
he
had
taken
so
much
trouble
with
,
and
would
be
glad
that
such
good
fortune
should
happen
to
her
:
she
would
always
be
very
grateful
to
him
,
and
he
would
be
well
provided
for
to
the
end
of
his
life
 
provided
for
as
the
excellent
part
he
had
done
by
the
child
deserved
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
not
an
appropriate
thing
for
people
in
a
higher
station
to
take
a
charge
off
the
hands
of
a
man
in
a
lower
?
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
an
eminently
appropriate
thing
to
Godfrey
,
for
reasons
that
were
known
only
to
himself
;
and
by
a
common
fallacy
,
he
imagined
the
measure
would
be
easy
because
he
had
private
motives
for
desiring
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
rather
a
coarse
mode
of
estimating
Silas
's
relation
to
Eppie
;
but
we
must
remember
that
many
of
the
impressions
which
Godfrey
was
likely
to
gather
concerning
the
labouring
people
around
him
would
favour
the
idea
that
deep
affections
can
hardly
go
along
with
callous
palms
and
scant
means
;
and
he
had
not
had
the
opportunity
,
even
if
he
had
had
the
power
,
of
entering
intimately
into
all
that
was
exceptional
in
the
weaver
's
experience
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
the
want
of
adequate
knowledge
that
could
have
made
it
possible
for
Godfrey
deliberately
to
entertain
an
unfeeling
project
:
his
natural
kindness
had
outlived
that
blighting
time
of
cruel
wishes
,
and
Nancy
's
praise
of
him
as
a
husband
was
not
founded
entirely
on
a
wilful
illusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
right
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
when
she
had
recalled
all
their
scenes
of
discussion
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
I
was
right
to
say
him
nay
,
though
it
hurt
me
more
than
anything
;
but
how
good
Godfrey
has
been
about
it
!
<EOS>
Many
men
would
have
been
very
angry
with
me
for
standing
out
against
their
wishes
;
and
they
might
have
thrown
out
that
they
'd
had
ill
-
luck
in
marrying
me
;
but
Godfrey
has
never
been
the
man
to
say
me
an
unkind
word
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
what
he
ca
n't
hide
:
everything
seems
so
blank
to
him
,
I
know
;
and
the
land
 
<EOS>
what
a
difference
<EOS>
it
'
ud
make
to
him
,
when
he
goes
to
see
after
things
,
if
he
'd
children
growing
up
that
he
was
doing
it
all
for
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
murmur
;
and
perhaps
if
he
'd
married
a
woman
who
'd
have
had
children
,
she
'd
have
vexed
him
in
other
ways
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
possibility
was
Nancy
's
chief
comfort
;
and
to
give
it
greater
strength
,
she
laboured
to
make
it
impossible
that
any
other
wife
should
have
had
more
perfect
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
_
forced
_
to
vex
him
by
that
one
denial
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
was
not
insensible
to
her
loving
effort
,
and
did
Nancy
no
injustice
as
to
the
motives
of
her
obstinacy
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
have
lived
with
her
fifteen
years
and
not
be
aware
that
an
unselfish
clinging
to
the
right
,
and
a
sincerity
clear
as
the
flower
-
born
dew
,
were
her
main
characteristics
;
indeed
,
Godfrey
felt
this
so
strongly
,
that
his
own
more
wavering
nature
,
too
averse
to
facing
difficulty
to
be
unvaryingly
simple
and
truthful
,
was
kept
in
a
certain
awe
of
this
gentle
wife
who
watched
his
looks
with
a
yearning
to
obey
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
he
should
ever
confess
to
her
the
truth
about
Eppie
:
she
would
never
recover
from
the
repulsion
the
story
of
his
earlier
marriage
would
create
,
told
to
her
now
,
after
that
long
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
child
,
too
,
he
thought
,
must
become
an
object
of
repulsion
:
the
very
sight
of
her
would
be
painful
.
<EOS>
The
shock
to
Nancy
's
mingled
pride
and
ignorance
of
the
world
's
evil
might
even
be
too
much
for
her
delicate
frame
.
 
<EOS>
Since
he
had
married
her
with
that
secret
on
his
heart
,
he
must
keep
it
there
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Whatever
else
he
did
,
he
could
not
make
an
irreparable
breach
between
himself
and
this
long
-
loved
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
why
could
he
not
make
up
his
mind
to
the
absence
of
children
from
a
hearth
brightened
by
such
a
wife
?
 
<EOS>
Why
did
his
mind
fly
uneasily
to
that
void
,
as
if
it
were
the
sole
reason
why
life
was
not
thoroughly
joyous
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
is
the
way
with
all
men
and
women
who
reach
middle
age
without
the
clear
perception
that
life
never
_
can
_
be
thoroughly
joyous
:
under
the
vague
dullness
of
the
grey
hours
,
dissatisfaction
seeks
a
definite
object
,
and
finds
it
in
the
privation
of
an
untried
good
.
 
<EOS>
Dissatisfaction
seated
musingly
on
a
childless
hearth
,
thinks
with
envy
of
the
father
whose
return
is
greeted
by
young
voices
 
seated
at
the
meal
where
the
little
heads
rise
one
above
another
like
nursery
plants
,
it
sees
a
black
care
hovering
behind
every
one
of
them
,
and
thinks
the
impulses
by
which
men
abandon
freedom
,
and
seek
for
ties
,
are
surely
nothing
but
a
brief
madness
.
 
<EOS>
In
Godfrey
's
case
there
were
further
reasons
why
his
thoughts
should
be
continually
solicited
by
this
one
point
in
his
lot
:
<EOS>
his
conscience
,
never
thoroughly
easy
about
Eppie
,
now
gave
his
childless
home
the
aspect
of
a
retribution
;
and
as
the
time
passed
on
,
under
Nancy
's
refusal
to
adopt
her
,
any
retrieval
of
his
error
became
more
and
more
difficult
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
Sunday
afternoon
it
was
already
four
years
since
there
had
been
any
allusion
to
the
subject
between
them
,
and
Nancy
supposed
that
it
was
for
ever
buried
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
he
'll
mind
it
less
or
more
as
he
gets
older
<EOS>
,
"
she
thought
;
"
I
'm
afraid
more
.
 
<EOS>
Aged
people
feel
the
miss
of
children
:
what
would
father
do
without
Priscilla
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
die
,
Godfrey
will
be
very
lonely
 
not
holding
together
with
his
brothers
much
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
be
over
-
anxious
,
and
trying
to
make
things
out
beforehand
:
I
must
do
my
best
for
the
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
last
thought
Nancy
roused
herself
from
her
reverie
,
and
turned
her
eyes
again
towards
the
forsaken
page
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
forsaken
longer
than
she
imagined
,
for
she
was
presently
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
the
servant
with
the
tea
-
things
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
fact
,
a
little
before
the
usual
time
for
tea
;
but
Jane
had
her
reasons
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
master
come
into
the
yard
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
'
m
,
he
is
n't
,
"
said
Jane
,
with
a
slight
emphasis
,
of
which
,
however
,
her
mistress
took
no
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
've
seen
'em
,
'
m
,
"
continued
Jane
,
after
a
pause
,
"
but
there
's
folks
making
haste
all
one
way
,
afore
the
front
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
something
's
happened
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
niver
a
man
to
be
seen
<EOS>
i
'
the
yard
,
<EOS>
else
I
'd
send
and
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
up
into
the
top
attic
,
but
there
's
no
seeing
anything
for
trees
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
nobody
's
hurt
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
I
daresay
there
's
nothing
much
the
matter
,
"
said
Nancy
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
perhaps
Mr.
Snell
's
bull
got
out
again
,
as
he
did
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
may
n't
gore
anybody
then
<EOS>
,
that
's
all
,
"
said
Jane
,
not
altogether
despising
a
hypothesis
which
covered
a
few
imaginary
calamities
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
girl
is
always
terrifying
me
,
"
thought
Nancy
;
"
I
wish
Godfrey
would
come
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
to
the
front
window
and
looked
as
far
as
she
could
see
along
the
road
,
with
an
uneasiness
which
she
felt
to
be
childish
,
for
there
were
now
no
such
signs
of
excitement
as
Jane
had
spoken
of
,
and
Godfrey
would
not
be
likely
to
return
by
the
village
road
,
but
<EOS>
by
the
fields
.
<EOS>
She
continued
to
stand
,
however
,
looking
at
the
placid
churchyard
with
the
long
shadows
of
the
gravestones
across
the
bright
green
hillocks
,
and
at
the
glowing
autumn
colours
of
the
Rectory
trees
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
Before
such
calm
external
beauty
the
presence
of
a
vague
fear
is
more
distinctly
felt
 
like
a
raven
flapping
its
slow
wing
across
the
sunny
air
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
wished
more
and
more
that
Godfrey
would
come
in
.
    
<EOS>
Some
one
opened
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
Nancy
felt
that
it
was
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
She
turned
from
the
window
with
gladness
in
her
eyes
,
for
the
wife
's
chief
dread
was
stilled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
I
'm
so
thankful
you
're
come
,
"
she
said
,
going
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
began
to
get
 
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
abruptly
,
for
Godfrey
was
laying
down
his
hat
with
trembling
hands
,
and
turned
towards
her
with
a
pale
face
and
a
strange
unanswering
glance
,
as
if
he
saw
her
indeed
,
but
saw
her
as
part
of
a
scene
invisible
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
not
daring
to
speak
again
;
but
he
left
the
touch
unnoticed
,
and
threw
himself
into
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
was
already
at
the
door
with
the
hissing
urn
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
her
to
keep
away
,
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Godfrey
;
and
when
the
door
was
closed
again
he
exerted
himself
to
speak
more
distinctly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
Nancy
 
there
,
"
he
said
,
pointing
to
a
chair
opposite
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
back
as
soon
as
I
could
,
to
hinder
anybody
's
telling
you
but
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
had
a
great
shock
 
<EOS>
but
I
care
most
about
the
shock
it
'll
be
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
father
and
Priscilla
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Nancy
,
with
quivering
lips
,
clasping
her
hands
together
tightly
on
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
's
nobody
living
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
unequal
to
the
considerate
skill
with
which
he
would
have
wished
to
make
his
revelation
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
Dunstan
 
<EOS>
my
brother
Dunstan
,
that
we
lost
sight
of
sixteen
years
ago
.
<EOS>
We
've
found
him
 
found
his
body
 
his
skeleton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
deep
dread
Godfrey
's
look
had
created
in
Nancy
made
her
feel
these
words
a
relief
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
in
comparative
calmness
to
hear
what
else
he
had
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
on
:
  
<EOS>
"
The
Stone
-
pit
has
gone
dry
suddenly
 
from
the
draining
,
I
suppose
;
and
there
he
lies
 
<EOS>
has
lain
for
sixteen
years
,
wedged
between
two
great
stones
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
his
watch
and
seals
,
and
there
's
my
gold
-
handled
hunting
-
whip
,
with
my
name
on
<EOS>
:
he
took
it
away
,
without
my
knowing
,
the
day
he
went
hunting
on
Wildfire
,
the
last
time
he
was
seen
.
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
paused
:
<EOS>
it
was
not
so
easy
to
say
what
came
next
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
drowned
himself
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Nancy
,
almost
wondering
that
her
husband
should
be
so
deeply
shaken
by
what
had
happened
all
those
years
ago
to
an
unloved
brother
,
of
whom
worse
things
had
been
augured
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
fell
in
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
,
as
if
he
felt
some
deep
meaning
in
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
he
added
:
"
Dunstan
was
the
man
that
robbed
Silas
Marner
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
blood
rushed
to
Nancy
's
face
and
neck
at
this
surprise
and
shame
,
for
she
had
been
bred
up
to
regard
even
a
distant
kinship
with
crime
as
a
dishonour
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Godfrey
!
"
 
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
compassion
in
her
tone
,
for
she
had
immediately
reflected
that
the
dishonour
must
be
felt
still
more
keenly
by
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
the
money
in
the
pit
,
"
he
continued
 
"
all
the
weaver
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
's
been
gathered
up
,
and
they
're
taking
the
skeleton
to
the
Rainbow
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
came
back
to
tell
you
:
<EOS>
there
was
no
hindering
it
;
you
must
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
silent
,
looking
on
the
ground
for
two
long
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
would
have
said
some
words
of
comfort
under
this
disgrace
,
but
she
refrained
,
from
an
instinctive
sense
that
there
was
something
behind
 
that
Godfrey
had
something
else
to
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
her
face
,
and
kept
them
fixed
on
her
,
as
he
said
    
"
Everything
comes
to
light
,
Nancy
,
sooner
or
later
.
 
<EOS>
When
God
Almighty
wills
it
,
our
secrets
are
found
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
lived
with
a
secret
on
my
mind
,
but
I
'll
keep
it
from
you
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
you
know
it
by
somebody
else
,
and
not
by
me
 
I
would
n't
have
you
find
it
out
after
I
'm
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
been
"
I
will
"
and
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
"
with
me
all
my
life
 
<EOS>
I
'll
make
sure
of
myself
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nancy
's
utmost
dread
had
returned
.
 
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
husband
and
wife
met
with
awe
in
them
,
as
at
a
crisis
which
suspended
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nancy
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
slowly
,
"
when
I
married
you
,
I
hid
something
from
you
 
something
I
ought
to
have
told
you
.
 
<EOS>
That
woman
Marner
found
dead
in
the
snow
 
<EOS>
Eppie
's
mother
 
<EOS>
that
wretched
woman
 
was
my
wife
:
Eppie
is
my
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
,
dreading
the
effect
of
his
confession
.
 
<EOS>
But
Nancy
sat
quite
still
,
only
that
her
eyes
dropped
and
ceased
to
meet
his
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
pale
and
quiet
as
a
meditative
statue
,
clasping
her
hands
on
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
never
think
the
same
of
me
again
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
after
a
little
while
,
with
some
tremor
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
n't
to
have
left
the
child
unowned
:
I
ought
n't
to
have
kept
it
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
could
n't
bear
to
give
you
up
,
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
led
away
into
marrying
her
 
<EOS>
I
suffered
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
Nancy
was
silent
,
looking
down
;
and
he
almost
expected
that
she
would
presently
get
up
and
say
she
would
go
to
her
father
's
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
have
any
mercy
for
faults
that
must
seem
so
black
to
her
,
with
her
simple
,
severe
notions
?
  
<EOS>
But
at
last
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
to
his
again
and
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
indignation
in
her
voice
 
only
deep
regret
.
  
<EOS>
"
Godfrey
,
if
you
had
but
told
me
this
six
years
ago
,
we
could
have
done
some
of
our
duty
by
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
'd
have
refused
to
take
her
in
,
if
I
'd
known
she
was
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
Godfrey
felt
all
the
bitterness
of
an
error
that
was
not
simply
futile
,
but
had
defeated
its
own
end
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
measured
this
wife
with
whom
he
had
lived
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
spoke
again
,
with
more
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
 
Oh
,
Godfrey
 
if
we
'd
had
her
from
the
first
,
if
you
'd
taken
to
her
as
you
ought
,
she
'd
have
loved
me
for
her
mother
 
<EOS>
and
you
'd
have
been
happier
with
me
<EOS>
:
I
could
better
have
bore
my
little
baby
dying
,
and
our
life
might
have
been
more
like
what
we
used
to
think
it
'
ud
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
fell
,
and
Nancy
ceased
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
would
n't
have
married
me
then
,
Nancy
,
if
I
'd
told
you
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
urged
,
in
the
bitterness
of
his
self
-
reproach
,
to
prove
to
himself
that
his
conduct
had
not
been
utter
folly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
think
you
would
now
,
but
you
would
n't
then
.
 
<EOS>
With
your
pride
and
your
father
's
,
you
'd
have
hated
having
anything
to
do
with
me
after
the
talk
there
'd
have
been
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
what
I
should
have
done
about
that
,
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
married
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
n't
worth
doing
wrong
for
 
<EOS>
nothing
is
in
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
is
so
good
as
it
seems
beforehand
 
not
even
our
marrying
was
n't
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
faint
sad
smile
on
Nancy
's
face
as
she
said
the
last
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
worse
man
than
you
thought
I
was
,
Nancy
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
rather
tremulously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
forgive
me
ever
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
wrong
to
me
is
but
little
,
Godfrey
<EOS>
:
you
've
made
it
up
to
me
 
<EOS>
you
've
been
good
to
me
for
fifteen
years
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
another
you
did
the
wrong
to
;
and
I
doubt
it
can
never
be
all
made
up
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
can
take
Eppie
now
,
"
said
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
mind
the
world
knowing
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
plain
and
open
for
the
rest
o
'
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
different
coming
to
us
<EOS>
,
now
she
's
grown
up
,
"
said
Nancy
,
shaking
her
head
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
your
duty
to
acknowledge
her
and
provide
for
her
;
and
I
'll
do
my
part
by
her
,
and
pray
to
God
Almighty
to
make
her
love
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
'll
go
together
to
Silas
Marner
's
this
very
night
,
as
soon
as
everything
's
quiet
at
the
Stone
-
pits
.
"
    
<EOS>
Between
eight
and
nine
o'clock
that
evening
,
Eppie
and
Silas
were
seated
alone
in
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
great
excitement
the
weaver
had
undergone
from
the
events
of
the
afternoon
,
he
had
felt
a
longing
for
this
quietude
,
and
had
even
begged
Mrs.
Winthrop
and
Aaron
,
who
had
naturally
lingered
behind
every
one
else
,
to
leave
him
alone
with
his
child
.
 
<EOS>
The
excitement
had
not
passed
away
:
it
had
only
reached
that
stage
when
the
keenness
of
the
susceptibility
makes
external
stimulus
intolerable
 
when
there
is
no
sense
of
weariness
,
but
rather
an
intensity
of
inward
life
,
under
which
sleep
is
an
impossibility
.
 
<EOS>
Any
one
who
has
watched
such
moments
in
other
men
remembers
the
brightness
of
the
eyes
and
the
strange
definiteness
that
comes
over
coarse
features
from
that
transient
influence
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
as
if
a
new
fineness
of
ear
for
all
spiritual
voices
had
sent
wonder
-
working
vibrations
through
the
heavy
mortal
frame
 
as
if
"
beauty
born
of
murmuring
sound
"
had
passed
into
the
face
of
the
listener
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
's
face
showed
that
sort
of
transfiguration
,
as
he
sat
in
his
arm
-
chair
and
looked
at
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
drawn
her
own
chair
towards
his
knees
,
and
leaned
forward
,
holding
both
his
hands
,
while
she
looked
up
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
table
near
them
,
lit
by
a
candle
,
lay
the
recovered
gold
 
the
old
long
-
loved
gold
,
ranged
in
orderly
heaps
,
as
Silas
used
to
range
it
in
the
days
when
it
was
his
only
joy
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
telling
her
how
he
used
to
count
it
every
night
,
and
how
his
soul
was
utterly
desolate
till
she
was
sent
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
first
,
I
'd
a
sort
<EOS>
o
'
feeling
come
across
me
now
and
then
,
"
he
was
saying
in
a
subdued
tone
,
"
as
if
you
might
be
changed
into
the
gold
again
;
for
sometimes
,
turn
my
head
which
way
<EOS>
I
would
,
I
seemed
to
see
the
gold
;
and
I
thought
I
should
be
glad
if
I
could
feel
it
,
and
find
it
was
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
did
n't
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
bit
,
I
should
have
thought
it
was
a
curse
come
again
,
if
it
had
drove
you
from
me
,
for
I
'd
got
to
feel
the
need
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
your
looks
and
your
voice
and
the
touch
<EOS>
o
'
your
little
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
n't
know
then
,
Eppie
,
when
you
were
such
a
little
un
 
<EOS>
you
did
n't
know
what
your
old
father
Silas
felt
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
know
now
,
father
,
"
said
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
n't
been
for
you
,
they
'd
have
taken
me
to
the
workhouse
,
and
there
'd
have
been
nobody
to
love
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
my
precious
child
,
the
blessing
was
mine
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
n't
been
sent
to
save
me
,
I
should
ha
'
gone
to
the
grave
in
my
misery
.
 
<EOS>
The
money
was
taken
away
from
me
in
time
;
and
you
see
it
's
been
kept
 
kept
till
it
was
wanted
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
wonderful
 
<EOS>
our
life
is
wonderful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
sat
in
silence
a
few
minutes
,
looking
at
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
takes
no
hold
of
me
now
,
"
he
said
,
ponderingly
 
"
the
money
does
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
it
ever
could
again
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
might
,
if
I
lost
you
,
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
come
to
think
I
was
forsaken
again
,
and
lose
the
feeling
that
God
was
good
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
;
and
Eppie
was
obliged
to
rise
without
answering
Silas
.
 
<EOS>
Beautiful
she
looked
,
with
the
tenderness
of
gathering
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
slight
flush
on
her
cheeks
,
as
she
stepped
to
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
flush
deepened
when
she
saw
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Godfrey
Cass
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
her
little
rustic
curtsy
,
and
held
the
door
wide
for
them
to
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
're
disturbing
you
very
late
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Cass
,
taking
Eppie
's
hand
,
and
looking
in
her
face
with
an
expression
of
anxious
interest
and
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
herself
was
pale
and
tremulous
.
  
<EOS>
Eppie
,
after
placing
chairs
for
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cass
,
went
to
stand
against
Silas
,
opposite
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Marner
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
trying
to
speak
with
perfect
firmness
,
"
it
's
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
see
you
with
your
money
again
,
that
you
've
been
deprived
of
so
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
my
family
<EOS>
did
you
the
wrong
 
<EOS>
the
more
grief
to
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
feel
bound
to
make
up
to
you
for
it
in
every
way
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
I
can
do
for
you
will
be
nothing
but
paying
a
debt
,
even
if
I
looked
no
further
than
the
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
are
other
things
I
'm
beholden
 
<EOS>
shall
be
beholden
to
you
for
,
Marner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
checked
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
agreed
between
him
and
his
wife
that
the
subject
of
his
fatherhood
should
be
approached
very
carefully
,
and
that
,
if
possible
,
the
disclosure
should
be
reserved
for
the
future
,
so
that
it
might
be
made
to
Eppie
gradually
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
had
urged
this
,
because
she
felt
strongly
the
painful
light
in
which
Eppie
must
inevitably
see
the
relation
between
her
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
,
always
ill
at
ease
when
he
was
being
spoken
to
by
"
betters
"
,
such
as
Mr.
Cass
 
tall
,
powerful
,
florid
men
,
seen
chiefly
on
horseback
 
answered
with
some
constraint
    
"
Sir
,
I
've
a
deal
to
thank
you
for
a'ready
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
robbery
,
I
count
it
no
loss
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
did
,
you
could
n't
help
it
:
you
are
n't
answerable
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
look
at
it
in
that
way
,
Marner
,
but
I
never
can
;
and
I
hope
you
'll
let
me
act
according
to
my
own
feeling
of
what
's
just
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
're
easily
contented
:
you
've
been
a
hard
-
working
man
all
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
yes
,
"
said
Marner
,
meditatively
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
ha
'
been
bad
off
without
my
work
:
it
was
what
I
held
by
when
everything
else
was
gone
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
applying
Marner
's
words
simply
to
his
bodily
wants
,
"
it
was
a
good
trade
for
you
in
this
country
,
because
there
's
been
a
great
deal
of
linen
-
weaving
to
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
're
getting
rather
past
such
close
work
<EOS>
,
Marner
:
it
's
time
you
laid
by
and
had
some
rest
.
 
<EOS>
You
look
a
good
deal
pulled
down
,
though
you
're
not
an
old
man
,
_
are
_
you
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Fifty
-
five
,
as
near
as
I
can
say
,
sir
,
"
said
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
why
,
you
may
live
thirty
years
longer
 
look
at
old
Macey
!
<EOS>
And
that
money
on
the
table
,
after
all
,
is
but
little
.
 
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
go
far
either
way
 
whether
it
's
put
out
to
interest
,
or
you
were
to
live
on
it
as
long
as
it
would
last
<EOS>
:
it
would
n't
go
far
if
you
'd
nobody
to
keep
<EOS>
but
yourself
,
and
<EOS>
you
've
had
two
to
keep
for
a
good
many
years
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Eh
,
sir
,
"
said
Silas
,
unaffected
by
anything
Godfrey
was
saying
,
"
I
'm
in
no
fear
<EOS>
o
'
want
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
do
very
well
 
<EOS>
Eppie
and
me
'
ull
do
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
few
working
-
folks
have
got
so
much
laid
by
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
gentlefolks
,
but
I
look
upon
it
as
a
deal
 
almost
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
for
us
,
it
's
little
we
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
the
garden
,
father
,
"
said
Eppie
,
blushing
up
to
the
ears
the
moment
after
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
love
a
garden
,
do
you
,
my
dear
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Nancy
,
thinking
that
this
turn
in
the
point
of
view
might
help
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
should
agree
in
that
:
I
give
a
deal
of
time
to
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
there
's
plenty
of
gardening
at
the
Red
House
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
surprised
at
the
difficulty
he
found
in
approaching
a
proposition
which
had
seemed
so
easy
to
him
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
done
a
good
part
by
Eppie
,
Marner
,
for
sixteen
years
.
 
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
a
great
comfort
to
you
to
see
her
well
provided
for
,
would
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
She
looks
blooming
and
healthy
,
but
not
fit
for
any
hardships
:
she
does
n't
look
like
a
strapping
girl
come
of
working
parents
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
like
to
see
her
taken
care
of
by
those
who
can
leave
her
well
off
,
and
make
a
lady
of
her
;
she
's
more
fit
for
it
than
for
a
rough
life
,
such
as
she
might
come
to
have
in
a
few
years
'
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
slight
flush
came
over
Marner
's
face
,
and
disappeared
,
like
a
passing
gleam
.
 
<EOS>
Eppie
was
simply
wondering
Mr.
Cass
should
talk
so
about
things
that
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
reality
;
but
Silas
was
hurt
and
uneasy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
take
your
meaning
,
sir
,
"
he
answered
,
not
having
words
at
command
to
express
the
mingled
feelings
with
which
he
had
heard
Mr.
Cass
's
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
meaning
is
this
,
Marner
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
determined
to
come
to
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Cass
and
I
,
you
know
,
have
no
children
 
nobody
to
benefit
by
our
good
home
and
everything
else
we
have
 
more
than
enough
for
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
should
like
to
have
somebody
in
the
place
of
a
daughter
to
us
 
we
should
like
to
have
Eppie
,
and
treat
her
in
every
way
as
our
own
child
.
 
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
a
great
comfort
to
you
in
your
old
age
,
I
hope
,
to
see
her
fortune
made
in
that
way
,
after
you
've
been
at
the
trouble
of
bringing
her
up
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
right
<EOS>
you
should
have
every
reward
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
And
Eppie
,
I
'm
sure
,
will
always
love
you
and
be
grateful
to
you
:
she
'd
come
and
see
you
very
often
,
and
we
should
all
be
on
the
look
-
out
to
do
everything
we
could
towards
making
you
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
plain
man
like
Godfrey
Cass
,
speaking
under
some
embarrassment
<EOS>
,
necessarily
blunders
on
words
that
are
coarser
than
his
intentions
,
and
that
are
likely
to
fall
gratingly
on
susceptible
feelings
.
<EOS>
While
he
had
been
speaking
,
Eppie
had
quietly
passed
her
arm
behind
Silas
's
head
,
and
let
her
hand
rest
against
it
caressingly
:
she
felt
him
trembling
violently
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
silent
for
some
moments
when
Mr.
Cass
had
ended
 
powerless
under
the
conflict
of
emotions
,
all
alike
painful
.
<EOS>
Eppie
's
heart
was
swelling
at
the
sense
that
her
father
was
in
distress
;
and
she
was
just
going
to
lean
down
and
speak
to
him
,
when
one
struggling
dread
at
last
gained
the
mastery
over
every
other
in
Silas
,
and
he
said
,
faintly
    
"
Eppie
,
my
child
,
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
stand
in
your
way
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eppie
took
her
hand
from
her
father
's
head
,
and
came
forward
a
step
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
were
flushed
,
but
not
with
shyness
this
time
:
the
sense
that
her
father
was
in
doubt
and
suffering
banished
that
sort
of
self
-
consciousness
.
 
<EOS>
She
dropped
a
low
curtsy
,
first
to
Mrs.
Cass
and
then
to
Mr.
Cass
,
and
said
    
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
 
<EOS>
thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
leave
my
father
,
nor
own
anybody
nearer
than
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
want
to
be
a
lady
 
<EOS>
thank
you
<EOS>
all
the
same
"
(
here
Eppie
dropped
another
curtsy
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
give
up
the
folks
I
've
been
used
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eppie
's
lips
began
to
tremble
a
little
at
the
last
words
.
 
<EOS>
She
retreated
to
her
father
's
chair
again
,
and
held
him
round
the
neck
:
while
Silas
,
with
a
subdued
sob
,
put
up
his
hand
to
grasp
hers
.
  
<EOS>
The
tears
were
in
Nancy
's
eyes
,
but
her
sympathy
with
Eppie
was
,
naturally
,
divided
with
distress
on
her
husband
's
account
.
 
<EOS>
She
dared
not
speak
,
wondering
what
was
going
on
in
her
husband
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
felt
an
irritation
inevitable
to
almost
all
of
us
when
we
encounter
an
unexpected
obstacle
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
full
of
his
own
penitence
and
resolution
to
retrieve
his
error
as
far
as
the
time
was
left
to
him
;
he
was
possessed
with
all
-
important
feelings
,
that
were
to
lead
to
a
predetermined
course
of
action
which
he
had
fixed
on
as
the
right
,
and
he
was
not
prepared
to
enter
with
lively
appreciation
into
other
people
's
feelings
counteracting
his
virtuous
resolves
.
 
<EOS>
The
agitation
with
which
he
spoke
again
was
not
quite
unmixed
with
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
've
a
claim
on
you
,
Eppie
 
<EOS>
the
strongest
of
all
claims
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
duty
,
Marner
,
to
own
Eppie
as
my
child
,
and
provide
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
my
own
child
 
<EOS>
her
mother
was
my
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
a
natural
claim
on
her
that
must
stand
before
every
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eppie
had
given
a
violent
start
,
and
turned
quite
pale
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
,
on
the
contrary
,
who
had
been
relieved
,
by
Eppie
's
answer
,
from
the
dread
lest
his
mind
should
be
in
opposition
to
hers
,
felt
the
spirit
of
resistance
in
him
set
free
,
not
without
a
touch
of
parental
fierceness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
sir
,
"
he
answered
,
with
an
accent
of
bitterness
that
had
been
silent
in
him
since
the
memorable
day
when
his
youthful
hope
had
perished
 
"
then
,
sir
,
why
did
n't
you
say
so
sixteen
year
ago
,
and
claim
her
before
I
'd
come
to
love
her
,
i'stead
o
'
coming
to
take
her
from
me
now
,
when
you
might
as
well
take
the
heart
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
body
?
 
<EOS>
God
gave
her
to
me
because
you
turned
your
back
upon
her
,
and
He
looks
upon
her
as
mine
:
<EOS>
you
've
no
right
to
her
!
 
<EOS>
When
a
man
turns
a
blessing
from
his
door
,
it
falls
to
them
as
take
it
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
repented
of
my
conduct
in
that
matter
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
who
could
not
help
feeling
the
edge
of
Silas
's
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Marner
,
with
gathering
excitement
;
"
but
repentance
does
n't
alter
what
's
been
going
on
for
sixteen
year
.
<EOS>
Your
coming
now
and
saying
"
I
'm
her
father
"
does
n't
alter
the
feelings
inside
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
me
<EOS>
she
's
been
calling
her
father
ever
since
she
could
say
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
you
might
look
at
the
thing
more
reasonably
,
Marner
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
unexpectedly
awed
by
the
weaver
's
direct
truth
-
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
as
if
she
was
to
be
taken
quite
away
from
you
,
so
that
you
'd
never
see
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
be
very
near
you
,
and
come
to
see
you
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
feel
just
the
same
towards
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
said
Marner
,
more
bitterly
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
'll
she
feel
just
the
same
for
me
as
she
does
now
,
when
we
eat
o
'
the
same
bit
,
and
drink
o
'
the
same
cup
,
and
think
o
'
the
same
things
from
one
day
's
end
to
another
?
 
<EOS>
Just
the
same
?
 
<EOS>
that
's
idle
talk
.
<EOS>
You
'd
cut
us
i
'
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
unqualified
by
experience
to
discern
the
pregnancy
of
Marner
's
simple
words
,
felt
rather
angry
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
that
the
weaver
was
very
selfish
(
a
judgment
readily
passed
by
those
who
have
never
tested
their
own
power
of
sacrifice
)
to
oppose
what
was
undoubtedly
for
Eppie
's
welfare
;
and
he
felt
himself
called
upon
,
for
her
sake
,
to
assert
his
authority
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
,
Marner
,
"
he
said
,
severely
 
"
I
should
have
thought
your
affection
for
Eppie
would
make
you
rejoice
in
what
was
for
her
good
,
even
if
it
did
call
upon
you
to
give
up
something
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
remember
your
own
life
's
uncertain
,
and
she
's
at
an
age
now
when
her
lot
may
soon
be
fixed
in
a
way
very
different
from
what
it
would
be
in
her
father
's
home
:
<EOS>
she
may
marry
some
low
working
-
man
,
and
then
,
whatever
I
might
do
for
her
,
I
could
n't
make
her
well
-
off
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
putting
yourself
in
the
way
of
her
welfare
;
and
though
I
'm
sorry
to
hurt
you
after
what
you
've
done
,
and
what
I
've
left
undone
,
I
feel
now
<EOS>
it
's
my
duty
to
insist
on
taking
care
of
my
own
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
do
my
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
it
were
Silas
or
Eppie
<EOS>
that
was
more
deeply
stirred
by
this
last
speech
of
Godfrey
's
.
 
<EOS>
Thought
had
been
very
busy
in
Eppie
as
she
listened
to
the
contest
between
her
old
long
-
loved
father
and
this
new
unfamiliar
father
who
had
suddenly
come
to
fill
the
place
of
that
black
featureless
shadow
which
had
held
the
ring
and
placed
it
on
her
mother
's
finger
.
 
<EOS>
Her
imagination
had
darted
backward
in
conjectures
,
and
forward
in
previsions
,
of
what
this
revealed
fatherhood
implied
;
and
there
were
words
in
Godfrey
's
last
speech
which
helped
to
make
the
previsions
especially
definite
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
these
thoughts
,
either
of
past
or
future
,
determined
her
resolution
 
_
that
_
was
determined
by
the
feelings
which
vibrated
to
every
word
Silas
had
uttered
;
but
they
raised
,
even
apart
from
these
feelings
,
a
repulsion
towards
the
offered
lot
and
the
newly
-
revealed
father
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
again
stricken
in
conscience
,
and
alarmed
lest
Godfrey
's
accusation
should
be
true
 
lest
he
should
be
raising
his
own
will
as
an
obstacle
to
Eppie
's
good
.
 
<EOS>
For
many
moments
he
was
mute
,
struggling
for
the
self
-
conquest
necessary
to
the
uttering
of
the
difficult
words
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
out
tremulously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
be
as
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
I
'll
hinder
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Even
Nancy
,
with
all
the
acute
sensibility
of
her
own
affections
,
shared
her
husband
's
view
,
that
Marner
was
not
justifiable
in
his
wish
to
retain
Eppie
,
after
her
real
father
had
avowed
himself
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
that
it
was
a
very
hard
trial
for
the
poor
weaver
,
but
her
code
allowed
no
question
that
a
father
by
blood
must
have
a
claim
above
that
of
any
foster
-
father
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
Nancy
,
used
all
her
life
to
plenteous
circumstances
and
the
privileges
of
"
respectability
"
,
could
not
enter
into
the
pleasures
which
early
nurture
and
habit
connect
with
all
the
little
aims
and
efforts
of
the
poor
who
are
born
poor
:
to
her
mind
,
Eppie
,
in
being
restored
to
her
birthright
,
was
entering
on
a
too
long
withheld
but
unquestionable
good
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
she
heard
Silas
's
last
words
with
relief
,
and
thought
,
as
Godfrey
did
,
that
their
wish
was
achieved
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eppie
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
looking
at
his
daughter
,
not
without
some
embarrassment
,
under
the
sense
that
she
was
old
enough
to
judge
him
,
"
it
'll
always
be
our
wish
that
you
should
show
your
love
and
gratitude
to
one
who
's
been
a
father
to
you
so
many
years
,
and
we
shall
want
to
help
you
to
make
him
comfortable
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
But
we
hope
you
'll
come
to
love
us
as
well
;
and
though
I
have
n't
been
what
a
father
should
ha
'
been
to
you
all
these
years
,
I
wish
to
do
the
utmost
in
my
power
for
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
,
and
provide
for
you
as
my
only
child
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
'll
have
the
best
of
mothers
in
my
wife
 
that
'll
be
a
blessing
you
have
n't
known
since
you
were
old
enough
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
'll
be
a
treasure
to
me
,
"
said
Nancy
,
in
her
gentle
voice
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
want
for
nothing
when
we
have
our
daughter
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eppie
did
not
come
forward
and
curtsy
,
as
she
had
done
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
held
Silas
's
hand
in
hers
,
and
grasped
it
firmly
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
weaver
's
hand
,
with
a
palm
and
finger
-
tips
that
were
sensitive
to
such
pressure
 
while
she
spoke
with
colder
decision
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
 
<EOS>
thank
you
,
sir
,
for
your
offers
 
<EOS>
they
're
very
great
,
and
far
above
my
wish
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
should
have
no
delight
<EOS>
i
'
life
any
more
if
I
was
forced
to
go
away
from
my
father
,
and
knew
he
was
sitting
at
home
,
a
-
thinking
of
me
and
feeling
lone
.
 
<EOS>
We
've
been
used
to
be
happy
together
every
day
,
and
I
ca
n't
think
o
'
no
happiness
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
says
he
'd
nobody
<EOS>
i
'
the
world
<EOS>
till
I
was
sent
to
him
,
and
he
'd
have
nothing
when
I
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
's
took
care
of
me
and
loved
me
from
the
first
,
and
I
'll
cleave
to
him
as
long
as
he
lives
,
and
nobody
shall
ever
come
between
him
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
make
sure
,
Eppie
,
"
said
Silas
,
in
a
low
voice
 
<EOS>
"
you
must
make
sure
as
you
wo
n't
ever
be
sorry
,
because
you
've
made
your
choice
to
stay
among
poor
folks
,
and
with
poor
clothes
and
things
,
when
you
might
ha
'
had
everything
<EOS>
o
'
the
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
sensitiveness
on
this
point
had
increased
as
he
listened
to
Eppie
's
words
of
faithful
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
be
sorry
,
father
,
"
said
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
know
what
to
think
on
or
to
wish
for
with
fine
things
about
me
,
as
I
have
n't
been
used
to
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
'
ud
be
poor
work
for
me
to
put
on
things
,
and
ride
in
a
gig
,
and
sit
in
a
place
at
church
,
as
'
ud
make
them
as
I
'm
fond
<EOS>
of
think
me
unfitting
company
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
_
<EOS>
I
_
care
for
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
Nancy
looked
at
Godfrey
with
a
pained
questioning
glance
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
floor
,
where
he
was
moving
the
end
of
his
stick
,
as
if
he
were
pondering
on
something
absently
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
there
was
a
word
which
might
perhaps
come
better
from
her
lips
than
from
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
say
is
natural
,
my
dear
child
 
<EOS>
it
's
natural
you
should
cling
to
those
who
've
brought
you
up
,
"
she
said
,
mildly
;
"
<EOS>
but
there
's
a
duty
you
owe
to
your
lawful
father
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
perhaps
something
to
be
given
up
on
more
sides
than
one
.
 
<EOS>
When
your
father
opens
his
home
to
you
,
I
think
it
's
right
<EOS>
you
should
n't
turn
your
back
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
feel
as
I
've
got
any
father
but
one
,
"
said
Eppie
,
impetuously
,
while
the
tears
gathered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
always
thought
of
a
little
home
where
he
'd
sit
<EOS>
i
'
the
corner
,
and
<EOS>
I
should
fend
and
do
everything
for
him
:
I
ca
n't
think
o
'
no
other
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
n't
brought
up
to
be
a
lady
,
and
I
ca
n't
turn
my
mind
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
the
working
-
folks
,
and
their
victuals
,
and
their
ways
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
"
she
ended
passionately
,
while
the
tears
fell
,
"
I
'm
promised
to
marry
a
working
-
man
,
as'll
live
with
father
,
and
help
me
to
take
care
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
looked
up
at
Nancy
with
a
flushed
face
and
smarting
dilated
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
This
frustration
of
a
purpose
towards
which
he
had
set
out
under
the
exalted
consciousness
that
he
was
about
to
compensate
in
some
degree
for
the
greatest
demerit
of
his
life
,
made
him
feel
the
air
of
the
room
stifling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
,
"
he
said
,
in
an
under
-
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
wo
n't
talk
of
this
any
longer
now
,
"
said
Nancy
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
your
well
-
wishers
,
my
dear
 
and
yours
too
,
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
come
and
see
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
getting
late
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
way
she
covered
her
husband
's
abrupt
departure
,
for
Godfrey
had
gone
straight
to
the
door
,
unable
to
say
more
.
    
<EOS>
Nancy
and
Godfrey
walked
home
under
the
starlight
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
entered
the
oaken
parlour
,
Godfrey
threw
himself
into
his
chair
,
while
Nancy
laid
down
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
stood
on
the
hearth
near
her
husband
,
unwilling
to
leave
him
even
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
yet
fearing
to
utter
any
word
lest
it
might
jar
on
his
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
Godfrey
turned
his
head
towards
her
,
and
their
eyes
met
,
dwelling
in
that
meeting
without
any
movement
on
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
That
quiet
mutual
gaze
of
a
trusting
husband
and
wife
is
like
the
first
moment
of
rest
or
refuge
from
a
great
weariness
or
a
great
danger
 
not
to
be
interfered
with
by
speech
or
action
which
would
distract
the
sensations
from
the
fresh
enjoyment
of
repose
.
  
<EOS>
But
presently
he
put
out
his
hand
,
and
as
Nancy
placed
hers
within
it
,
he
drew
her
towards
him
,
and
said
    
"
That
's
ended
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
bent
to
kiss
him
,
and
then
said
,
as
she
stood
by
his
side
,
"
Yes
,
I
'm
afraid
we
must
give
up
the
hope
of
having
her
for
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
right
to
want
to
force
her
to
come
to
us
against
her
will
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
alter
her
bringing
up
and
what
's
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
with
a
keen
decisiveness
of
tone
,
in
contrast
with
his
usually
careless
and
unemphatic
speech
 
<EOS>
"
there
's
debts
we
ca
n't
pay
like
money
debts
,
by
paying
extra
for
the
years
that
have
slipped
by
.
<EOS>
While
I
've
been
putting
off
and
putting
off
,
the
trees
have
been
growing
 
<EOS>
it
's
too
late
now
.
 
<EOS>
Marner
was
in
the
right
in
what
he
said
about
a
man
's
turning
away
a
blessing
from
his
door
:
it
falls
to
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
pass
for
childless
once
,
Nancy
 
<EOS>
I
shall
pass
for
childless
now
against
my
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nancy
did
not
speak
immediately
,
but
after
a
little
while
she
asked
 
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
make
it
known
,
then
,
about
Eppie
's
being
your
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
where
would
be
the
good
to
anybody
?
 
<EOS>
only
harm
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
do
what
I
can
for
her
in
the
state
of
life
she
chooses
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
see
who
it
is
she
's
thinking
of
marrying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
wo
n't
do
any
good
to
make
the
thing
known
,
"
said
Nancy
,
who
thought
she
might
now
allow
herself
the
relief
of
entertaining
a
feeling
which
she
had
tried
to
silence
before
,
"
I
should
be
very
thankful
for
father
and
Priscilla
never
to
be
troubled
with
knowing
what
was
done
in
the
past
,
more
than
about
Dunsey
:
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
their
knowing
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
put
it
in
my
will
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
put
it
in
my
will
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
like
to
leave
anything
to
be
found
out
,
like
this
of
Dunsey
,
"
said
Godfrey
,
meditatively
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
see
anything
but
difficulties
that
'
ud
come
from
telling
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
do
what
I
can
to
make
her
happy
in
her
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
a
notion
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
it
's
Aaron
Winthrop
<EOS>
she
meant
she
was
engaged
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
seeing
him
with
her
and
Marner
going
away
from
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
's
very
sober
and
industrious
,
"
said
Nancy
,
trying
to
view
the
matter
as
cheerfully
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
fell
into
thoughtfulness
again
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
he
looked
up
at
Nancy
sorrowfully
,
and
said
    
"
She
's
a
very
pretty
,
nice
girl
,
is
n't
she
,
Nancy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
;
and
with
just
your
hair
and
eyes
<EOS>
:
I
wondered
it
had
never
struck
me
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
took
a
dislike
to
me
at
the
thought
of
my
being
her
father
:
I
could
see
a
change
in
her
manner
after
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
could
n't
bear
to
think
of
not
looking
on
Marner
as
her
father
,
"
said
Nancy
,
not
wishing
to
confirm
her
husband
's
painful
impression
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
thinks
I
did
wrong
by
her
mother
as
well
as
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
thinks
me
worse
than
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
_
must
_
think
it
:
<EOS>
she
can
never
know
all
.
<EOS>
It
's
part
of
my
punishment
,
Nancy
,
for
my
daughter
to
dislike
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
got
into
that
trouble
if
I
'd
been
true
to
you
 
if
I
had
n't
been
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
no
right
to
expect
anything
but
evil
could
come
of
that
marriage
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
shirked
doing
a
father
's
part
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nancy
was
silent
:
her
spirit
of
rectitude
would
not
let
her
try
to
soften
the
edge
of
what
she
felt
to
be
a
just
compunction
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
again
after
a
little
while
,
but
the
tone
was
rather
changed
<EOS>
:
there
was
tenderness
mingled
with
the
previous
self
-
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
got
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
Nancy
,
in
spite
of
all
;
and
yet
I
've
been
grumbling
and
uneasy
because
I
had
n't
something
else
 
as
if
I
deserved
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
never
been
wanting
to
me
,
Godfrey
,
"
said
Nancy
,
with
quiet
sincerity
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
only
trouble
would
be
gone
if
you
resigned
yourself
to
the
lot
that
's
been
given
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
it
is
n't
too
late
to
mend
a
bit
there
.
 
<EOS>
Though
it
_
is
_
too
late
to
mend
some
things
,
say
what
they
will
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
when
Silas
and
Eppie
were
seated
at
their
breakfast
,
he
said
to
her
    
"
Eppie
,
there
's
a
thing
I
've
had
on
my
mind
to
do
this
two
year
,
and
now
the
money
's
been
brought
back
to
us
,
we
can
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
turning
it
over
and
over
in
the
night
,
and
I
think
we
'll
set
out
to
-
morrow
,
while
the
fine
days
last
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
leave
the
house
and
everything
for
your
godmother
to
take
care
on
,
and
we
'll
make
a
little
bundle
o
'
things
and
set
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
to
go
,
daddy
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Eppie
,
in
much
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
my
old
country
 
to
the
town
where
I
was
born
 
up
Lantern
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
Mr.
Paston
,
the
minister
:
<EOS>
something
may
ha
'
come
out
to
make
'em
know
<EOS>
I
was
<EOS>
innicent
o
'
the
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Paston
was
a
man
with
a
deal
o
'
light
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
him
about
the
drawing
o
'
the
lots
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
should
like
to
talk
to
him
about
the
religion
o
'
this
country
-
side
,
for
I
partly
think
he
does
n't
know
on
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eppie
was
very
joyful
,
for
there
was
the
prospect
not
only
of
wonder
and
delight
at
seeing
a
strange
country
,
but
also
of
coming
back
to
tell
Aaron
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Aaron
was
so
much
wiser
than
she
was
about
most
things
 
<EOS>
it
would
be
rather
pleasant
to
have
this
little
advantage
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
though
possessed
with
a
dim
fear
of
dangers
attendant
on
so
long
a
journey
,
and
requiring
many
assurances
that
it
would
not
take
them
out
of
the
region
of
carriers
'
carts
and
slow
waggons
,
was
nevertheless
well
pleased
that
Silas
should
revisit
his
own
country
,
and
find
out
if
he
had
been
cleared
from
that
false
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
be
easier
in
your
mind
for
the
rest
o
'
<EOS>
your
life
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
<EOS>
Dolly
 
"
that
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
there
's
any
light
to
be
got
up
the
yard
as
you
talk
on
,
we
've
need
of
it
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
this
world
,
<EOS>
and
I
'd
be
glad
on
it
myself
,
if
you
could
bring
it
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
on
the
fourth
day
from
that
time
,
Silas
and
Eppie
,
in
their
Sunday
clothes
,
with
a
small
bundle
tied
in
a
blue
linen
handkerchief
,
were
making
their
way
through
the
streets
of
a
great
manufacturing
town
.
<EOS>
Silas
,
bewildered
by
the
changes
thirty
years
had
brought
over
his
native
place
,
had
stopped
several
persons
in
succession
to
ask
them
the
name
of
this
town
,
that
he
might
be
sure
he
was
not
under
a
mistake
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
for
Lantern
Yard
,
father
 
ask
this
gentleman
with
the
tassels
on
his
shoulders
a
-
standing
at
the
shop
door
;
he
is
n't
in
a
hurry
like
the
rest
,
"
said
Eppie
,
in
some
distress
at
her
father
's
bewilderment
,
and
ill
at
ease
,
besides
,
amidst
the
noise
,
the
movement
,
and
the
multitude
of
strange
indifferent
faces
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
my
child
,
he
wo
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
"
said
Silas
;
"
gentlefolks
did
n't
ever
go
up
the
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
But
happen
somebody
can
tell
me
which
is
the
way
to
Prison
Street
,
where
the
jail
is
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
way
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
that
as
if
I
'd
seen
it
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
some
difficulty
,
after
many
turnings
and
new
inquiries
,
they
reached
Prison
Street
;
and
the
grim
walls
of
the
jail
,
the
first
object
that
answered
to
any
image
in
Silas
's
memory
,
cheered
him
with
the
certitude
,
which
no
assurance
of
the
town
's
name
had
hitherto
given
him
,
that
he
was
in
his
native
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
he
said
,
drawing
a
long
breath
,
"
there
's
the
jail
,
Eppie
;
that
's
just
the
same
:
I
are
n't
afraid
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
third
turning
on
the
left
hand
from
the
jail
doors
 
<EOS>
that
's
the
way
we
must
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
dark
ugly
place
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
it
hides
the
sky
!
<EOS>
It
's
worse
than
the
Workhouse
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
you
do
n't
live
in
this
town
now
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Lantern
Yard
like
this
street
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
precious
child
,
"
said
Silas
,
smiling
,
"
it
is
n't
a
big
street
like
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
easy
<EOS>
i
'
this
street
myself
,
<EOS>
but
I
was
fond
o
'
Lantern
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
The
shops
here
are
all
altered
,
I
think
 
I
ca
n't
make
'em
out
;
but
I
shall
know
the
turning
,
because
it
's
the
third
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
,
as
they
came
to
a
narrow
alley
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
then
we
must
go
to
the
left
again
,
and
then
straight
for'ard
for
a
bit
,
up
Shoe
Lane
:
<EOS>
and
then
we
shall
be
at
the
entry
next
to
the
o'erhanging
window
,
where
there
's
the
nick
in
the
road
for
the
water
to
run
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
I
can
see
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
father
,
I
'm
like
as
if
I
was
stifled
,
"
said
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
ha
'
thought
as
any
folks
lived
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
this
way
,
so
close
together
.
 
<EOS>
How
pretty
the
Stone
-
pits
'
ull
look
when
we
get
back
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
looks
comical
to
_
me
_
,
child
,
now
 
and
smells
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
as
it
usened
to
smell
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
and
there
a
sallow
,
begrimed
face
looked
out
from
a
gloomy
doorway
at
the
strangers
,
and
increased
Eppie
's
uneasiness
,
so
that
it
was
a
longed
-
for
relief
when
they
issued
from
the
alleys
into
Shoe
Lane
,
where
there
was
a
broader
strip
of
sky
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
heart
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Silas
,
"
why
,
there
's
people
coming
out
o
'
the
Yard
as
if
they
'd
been
to
chapel
at
this
time
o
'
day
 
a
weekday
noon
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
started
and
stood
still
with
a
look
of
distressed
amazement
,
that
alarmed
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
before
an
opening
in
front
of
a
large
factory
,
from
which
men
and
women
were
streaming
for
their
midday
meal
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
Eppie
,
clasping
his
arm
<EOS>
,
"
what
's
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
she
had
to
speak
again
and
again
before
Silas
could
answer
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
gone
,
child
,
"
he
said
,
at
last
,
in
strong
agitation
 
"
Lantern
Yard
's
gone
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
ha
'
been
here
,
because
here
's
the
house
with
the
o'erhanging
window
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
 
it
's
just
the
same
;
but
they
've
made
this
new
opening
;
and
see
that
big
factory
!
<EOS>
It
's
all
gone
 
chapel
and
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
into
that
little
brush
-
shop
and
sit
down
,
father
 
<EOS>
they
'll
let
you
sit
down
,
"
said
Eppie
,
always
on
the
watch
<EOS>
lest
one
of
her
father
's
strange
attacks
should
come
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
the
people
can
tell
you
all
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
neither
from
the
brush
-
maker
,
who
had
come
to
Shoe
Lane
only
ten
years
ago
,
when
the
factory
was
already
built
,
nor
from
any
other
source
within
his
reach
,
could
Silas
learn
anything
of
the
old
Lantern
Yard
friends
,
or
of
Mr.
Paston
the
minister
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
place
is
all
swep
'
away
,
"
Silas
said
to
Dolly
Winthrop
on
the
night
of
his
return
 
"
the
little
graveyard
and
everything
.
<EOS>
The
old
home
's
gone
;
I
've
no
home
<EOS>
but
this
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
know
whether
they
got
at
the
truth
<EOS>
o
'
the
robbery
,
nor
whether
Mr.
Paston
could
ha
'
given
me
any
light
about
the
drawing
o
'
the
lots
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
dark
to
me
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
that
is
;
I
doubt
it
'll
be
dark
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
,
Master
Marner
,
"
said
Dolly
,
who
sat
with
a
placid
listening
face
,
now
bordered
by
grey
hairs
;
"
I
doubt
it
may
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
will
o
'
<EOS>
Them
above
as
a
many
things
should
be
dark
to
us
;
but
there
's
some
things
as
I
've
never
felt
<EOS>
i
'
the
dark
about
,
and
they
're
mostly
what
comes
<EOS>
i
'
the
day
's
work
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
hard
done
by
that
once
,
Master
Marner
,
and
it
seems
as
you
'll
never
know
the
rights
of
it
;
but
that
does
n't
hinder
there
_
being
_
<EOS>
a
rights
,
Master
Marner
,
for
all
it
's
dark
to
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Silas
,
"
no
;
that
does
n't
hinder
.
 
<EOS>
Since
the
time
the
child
was
sent
to
me
<EOS>
and
I
've
come
to
love
her
as
myself
<EOS>
,
I
've
had
light
enough
to
trusten
by
;
and
now
she
says
she
'll
never
leave

CONCLUSION
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
time
of
the
year
which
was
held
in
Raveloe
to
be
especially
suitable
for
a
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
when
the
great
lilacs
and
laburnums
in
the
old
-
fashioned
gardens
showed
their
golden
and
purple
wealth
above
the
lichen
-
tinted
walls
,
and
when
there
were
calves
still
young
enough
to
want
bucketfuls
of
fragrant
milk
.
<EOS>
People
were
not
so
busy
then
as
they
must
become
when
the
full
cheese
-
making
and
the
mowing
had
set
in
;
and
besides
,
it
was
a
time
when
a
light
bridal
dress
could
be
worn
with
comfort
and
seen
to
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
Happily
the
sunshine
fell
more
warmly
than
usual
on
the
lilac
tufts
the
morning
that
Eppie
was
married
,
for
her
dress
<EOS>
was
a
very
light
one
.
<EOS>
She
had
often
thought
,
though
with
a
feeling
of
renunciation
,
that
the
perfection
of
a
wedding
-
dress
would
be
a
white
cotton
,
with
the
tiniest
pink
sprig
at
wide
intervals
;
so
that
when
Mrs.
Godfrey
Cass
begged
to
provide
one
,
and
asked
Eppie
to
choose
what
it
should
be
,
previous
meditation
had
enabled
her
to
give
a
decided
answer
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Seen
at
a
little
distance
as
she
walked
across
the
churchyard
and
down
the
village
,
she
seemed
to
be
attired
in
pure
white
,
and
her
hair
looked
like
the
dash
of
gold
on
a
lily
.
 
<EOS>
One
hand
was
on
her
husband
's
arm
,
and
with
the
other
she
clasped
the
hand
of
her
father
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
giving
me
away
,
father
,
"
she
had
said
before
they
went
to
church
;
"
you
'll
only
be
taking
Aaron
to
be
a
son
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
Winthrop
walked
behind
with
her
husband
;
and
there
ended
the
little
bridal
procession
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
many
eyes
to
look
at
it
,
and
Miss
Priscilla
Lammeter
was
glad
that
she
and
her
father
had
happened
to
drive
up
to
the
door
of
the
Red
House
just
in
time
to
see
this
pretty
sight
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
come
to
keep
Nancy
company
to
-
day
,
because
Mr.
Cass
had
had
to
go
away
to
Lytherley
,
for
special
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
That
seemed
to
be
a
pity
,
for
otherwise
he
might
have
gone
,
as
Mr.
Crackenthorp
and
Mr.
Osgood
certainly
would
,
to
look
on
at
the
wedding
-
feast
which
he
had
ordered
at
the
Rainbow
,
naturally
feeling
a
great
interest
in
the
weaver
who
had
been
wronged
by
one
of
his
own
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
ha
'
wished
Nancy
had
had
the
luck
to
find
a
child
like
that
and
bring
her
up
,
"
said
Priscilla
to
her
father
,
as
they
sat
in
the
gig
;
"
I
should
ha
'
had
something
young
to
think
of
then
,
besides
the
lambs
and
the
calves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammeter
;
"
one
feels
that
as
one
gets
older
.
 
<EOS>
Things
look
dim
to
old
folks
:
they
'd
need
have
some
young
eyes
about
'em
,
to
let
'em
know
the
world
's
the
same
as
it
used
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nancy
came
out
now
to
welcome
her
father
and
sister
;
and
the
wedding
group
had
passed
on
beyond
the
Red
House
to
the
humbler
part
of
the
village
.
  
<EOS>
Dolly
Winthrop
was
the
first
to
divine
<EOS>
that
old
Mr.
Macey
,
who
had
been
set
in
his
arm
-
chair
outside
his
own
door
,
would
expect
some
special
notice
as
they
passed
,
since
he
was
too
old
to
be
at
the
wedding
-
feast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Macey
's
looking
for
a
word
from
us
,
"
said
Dolly
;
"
he
'll
be
hurt
if
we
pass
him
and
say
nothing
 
and
him
so
racked
with
rheumatiz
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
they
turned
aside
to
shake
hands
with
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
looked
forward
to
the
occasion
,
and
had
his
premeditated
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Master
Marner
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
voice
that
quavered
a
good
deal
,
"
I
've
lived
to
see
my
words
come
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
the
first
to
say
there
was
no
harm
in
you
,
though
your
looks
might
be
again
'
you
;
and
I
was
the
first
to
say
you
'd
get
your
money
back
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
nothing
but
rightful
as
you
should
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'd
ha
'
said
the
"
Amens
"
,
and
willing
,
at
the
holy
matrimony
;
but
Tookey
's
done
it
a
good
while
now
,
and
I
hope
you
'll
have
none
the
worse
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
open
yard
before
the
Rainbow
the
party
of
guests
were
already
assembled
,
though
it
was
still
nearly
an
hour
before
the
appointed
feast
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
by
this
means
they
could
not
only
enjoy
the
slow
advent
of
their
pleasure
;
they
had
also
ample
leisure
to
talk
of
Silas
Marner
's
strange
history
,
and
arrive
by
due
degrees
at
the
conclusion
that
he
had
brought
a
blessing
on
himself
by
acting
like
a
father
to
a
lone
motherless
child
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
farrier
did
not
negative
this
sentiment
:
on
the
contrary
,
he
took
it
up
as
peculiarly
his
own
,
and
invited
any
hardy
person
present
to
contradict
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
met
with
no
contradiction
;
and
all
differences
among
the
company
were
merged
in
a
general
agreement
with
Mr.
Snell
's
sentiment
,
that
when
a
man
had
deserved
his
good
luck
,
it
was
the
part
of
his
neighbours
to
wish
him
joy
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
bridal
group
approached
,
a
hearty
cheer
was
raised
in
the
Rainbow
yard
;
and
Ben
Winthrop
,
whose
jokes
had
retained
their
acceptable
flavour
,
found
it
agreeable
to
turn
in
there
and
receive
congratulations
;
not
requiring
the
proposed
interval
of
quiet
at
the
Stone
-
pits
before
joining
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
Eppie
had
a
larger
garden
than
she
had
ever
expected
there
now
;
and
in
other
ways
there
had
been
alterations
at
the
expense
of
Mr.
Cass
,
the
landlord
,
to
suit
Silas
's
larger
family
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
and
Eppie
had
declared
that
they
would
rather
stay
at
the
Stone
-
pits
than
go
to
any
new
home
.
<EOS>
The
garden
was
fenced
with
stones
on
two
sides
,
but
in
front
there
was
an
open
fence
,
through
which
the
flowers
shone
with
answering
gladness
,
as
the
four
united
people
came
within
sight
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
father
,
"
said
Eppie
,
"
what
a
pretty
home
ours
is
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
nobody
could
be
happier
than
we
are
.
