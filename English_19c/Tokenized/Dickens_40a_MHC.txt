My
Dear
Sir
,
    
Let
me
have
my
Pleasures
of
Memory
in
connection
with
this
book
,
by
dedicating
it
to
a
Poet
whose
writings
(
as
all
the
world
knows
)
are
replete
with
generous
and
earnest
feeling
;
and
to
a
man
whose
daily
life
(
as
all
the
world
does
not
know
)
<EOS>
is
one
of
active
sympathy
with
the
poorest
and
humblest
of
his
kind
.
     
<EOS>
Your
faithful
friend
,

ADDRESS
BY
CHARLES
DICKENS

<EOS>
4th
April
,

.
          
<EOS>
Master
Humphrey
earnestly
hopes
,
(
and
is
almost
tempted
to
believe
,
)
that
all
degrees
of
readers
,
young
or
old
,
rich
or
poor
,
sad
or
merry
,
easy
of
amusement
or
difficult
to
entertain
,
may
find
something
agreeable
in
the
face
of
his
old
clock
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
when
they
have
made
its
acquaintance
,
its
voice
may
sound
cheerfully
in
their
ears
,
and
be
suggestive
of
none
but
pleasant
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
may
come
to
have
favourite
and
familiar
associations
connected
with
its
name
,
and
to
look
for
it
as
for
a
welcome
friend
.
          
<EOS>
From
week
to
week
,
then
,
Master
Humphrey
will
set
his
clock
,
trusting
that
while
it
counts
the
hours
,
it
will
sometimes
cheat
them
of
their
heaviness
,
and
that
while
it
marks
the
thread
of
Time
,
it
will
scatter
a
few
slight
flowers
in
the
Old
Mower
’s
path
.
          
<EOS>
Until
the
specified
period
arrives
,
and
he
can
enter
freely
upon
that
confidence
with
his
readers
which
he
is
impatient
to
maintain
,
he
may
only
bid
them
a
short
farewell
,
and
look
forward
to
their
next
meeting
.

PREFACE
TO
THE
FIRST
VOLUME
         
<EOS>
When
the
Author
commenced
this
Work
,
he
proposed
to
himself
three
objects
---
           
First
.
 
<EOS>
To
establish
a
periodical
,
which
should
enable
him
to
present
,
under
one
general
head
,
and
not
as
separate
and
distinct
publications
,
certain
fictions
that
he
had
it
in
contemplation
to
write
.
          
<EOS>
Secondly
.
 
<EOS>
To
produce
these
Tales
in
weekly
numbers
,
hoping
that
to
shorten
the
intervals
of
communication
between
himself
and
his
readers
,
would
be
to
knit
more
closely
the
pleasant
relations
they
had
held
,
for
Forty
Months
.
          
<EOS>
Thirdly
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
execution
of
this
weekly
task
,
to
have
as
much
regard
as
its
exigencies
would
permit
,
to
each
story
as
a
whole
,
and
to
the
possibility
of
its
publication
at
some
distant
day
,
apart
from
the
machinery
in
which
it
had
its
origin
.
          
<EOS>
The
characters
of
Master
Humphrey
and
his
three
friends
,
and
the
little
fancy
of
the
clock
,
were
the
results
of
these
considerations
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
sought
to
interest
his
readers
in
those
who
talked
,
and
read
,
and
listened
,
he
revived
Mr.
Pickwick
and
his
humble
friends
;
not
with
any
intention
of
re
-
opening
an
exhausted
and
abandoned
mine
,
but
to
connect
them
in
the
thoughts
of
those
whose
favourites
they
had
been
,
with
the
tranquil
enjoyments
of
Master
Humphrey
.
          
<EOS>
It
was
never
the
intention
of
the
Author
to
make
the
Members
of
Master
Humphrey
’s
clock
,
active
agents
in
the
stories
they
are
supposed
to
relate
.
 
<EOS>
Having
brought
himself
in
the
commencement
of
his
undertaking
to
feel
an
interest
in
these
quiet
creatures
,
and
to
imagine
them
in
their
chamber
of
p.
xvmeeting
,
eager
listeners
to
all
he
had
to
tell
,
the
Author
hoped
—
as
authors
will
—
to
succeed
in
awakening
some
of
his
own
emotion
in
the
bosoms
of
his
readers
.
 
<EOS>
Imagining
Master
Humphrey
in
his
chimney
corner
,
resuming
night
after
night
<EOS>
the
narrative,—say
,
of
the
Old
Curiosity
Shop
—
picturing
to
himself
the
various
sensations
of
his
hearers
—
thinking
how
Jack
Redburn
might
incline
to
poor
Kit
,
and
perhaps
lean
too
favourably
even
towards
the
lighter
vices
of
Mr.
Richard
Swiveller
—
how
the
deaf
gentleman
would
have
his
favourite
and
Mr.
Miles
his
—
and
how
all
these
gentle
spirits
would
trace
some
faint
reflexion
in
their
past
lives
in
the
varying
currents
of
the
tale
<EOS>
—
he
has
insensibly
fallen
into
the
belief
that
they
are
present
to
his
readers
as
they
are
to
him
,
and
has
forgotten
that
,
like
one
whose
vision
is
disordered
,
he
may
be
conjuring
up
bright
figures
when
there
is
nothing
but
empty
space
.
          
<EOS>
The
short
papers
which
are
to
be
found
at
the
beginning
of
the
volume
were
indispensable
to
the
form
of
publication
and
the
limited
extent
of
each
number
,
as
no
story
of
length
or
interest
could
be
begun
until
"
The
Clock
was
wound
up
and
fairly
going
.
"
          
<EOS>
The
Author
would
fain
hope
that
there
are
not
many
who
would
disturb
Master
Humphrey
and
his
friends
in
their
seclusion
;
who
would
have
them
forego
their
present
enjoyments
,
to
exchange
those
confidences
with
each
other
,
the
absence
of
which
is
the
foundation
of
their
mutual
trust
.
 
<EOS>
For
when
their
occupation
is
gone
,
when
their
tales
are
ended
,
and
but
their
personal
histories
remain
,
the
chimney
corner
will
be
growing
cold
,
and
the
clock
will
be
about
to
stop
for
ever
.
          
<EOS>
One
other
word
in
his
own
person
,
and
he
returns
to
the
more
grateful
task
of
speaking
for
those
imaginary
people
whose
little
world
lies
within
these
pages
.
          
<EOS>
It
may
be
some
consolation
to
those
well
-
disposed
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
,
in
the
interval
between
the
conclusion
of
his
last
work
and
the
commencement
of
this
,
originated
a
report
that
he
had
gone
raving
mad
,
to
know
that
it
spread
p.
xvias
rapidly
as
could
be
desired
,
and
was
made
the
subject
of
considerable
dispute
;
not
as
regarded
the
fact
,
for
<EOS>
that
was
as
thoroughly
established
as
the
duel
between
Sir
Peter
Teazle
and
Charles
Surface
in
the
School
for
Scandal
;
but
with
reference
to
the
unfortunate
lunatic
’s
place
of
confinement
;
one
party
insisting
positively
on
Bedlam
,
another
inclining
favourably
towards
St.
Luke
’s
,
and
a
third
swearing
strongly
by
the
asylum
at
Hanwell
;
while
each
backed
its
case
by
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
same
excellent
nature
as
that
brought
to
bear
by
Sir
Benjamin
Backbite
on
the
pistol
shot
which
struck
against
the
little
bronze
bust
of
Shakespeare
over
the
fireplace
,
grazed
out
of
the
window
at
a
right
angle
,
and
wounded
the
postman
,
who
was
coming
to
the
door
with
a
double
letter
from
Northamptonshire
.
          
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
great
affliction
to
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
learn
—
and
he
is
so
unwilling
to
give
pain
,
that
he
would
not
whisper
the
circumstance
on
any
account
,
did
he
not
feel
in
a
manner
bound
to
do
so
,
in
gratitude
to
those
amongst
his
friends
who
were
at
the
trouble
of
being
angry
at
the
absurdity
that
their
inventions
made
the
Author
<EOS>
’s
home
unusually
merry
,
and
gave
rise
to
an
extraordinary
number
of
jests
,
of
which
he
will
only
add
,
in
the
words
of
the
good
Vicar
of
Wakefield
,
"
I
can
not
say
whether
we
had
more
wit
among
us
than
usual
;
but
I
am
sure
we
had
more
laughing
.

REFACE
TO
THE
SECOND
VOLUME
         
<EOS>
"
An
author
,
"
says
Fielding
,
in
his
introduction
to
Tom
Jones
,
"
ought
to
consider
himself
,
not
as
the
gentleman
who
gives
a
private
or
eleemosynary
treat
,
but
rather
as
one
who
keeps
a
public
ordinary
,
to
which
all
persons
are
welcome
for
their
money
.
 
<EOS>
Men
who
pay
for
what
they
eat
,
will
insist
on
gratifying
their
palates
,
however
nice
and
whimsical
these
may
prove
;
and
if
everything
is
not
agreeable
to
their
taste
,
will
challenge
a
right
to
censure
,
to
abuse
,
and
to
damn
their
dinner
without
control
.
          
<EOS>
"
To
prevent
,
therefore
,
giving
offence
to
their
customers
by
any
such
disappointment
,
it
hath
been
usual
with
the
honest
and
well
-
meaning
host
to
provide
a
bill
of
fare
,
which
all
persons
may
peruse
at
their
first
entrance
into
the
house
;
and
having
thence
acquainted
themselves
with
the
entertainment
which
they
may
expect
,
may
either
stay
and
regale
with
what
is
provided
for
them
,
or
may
depart
to
some
other
ordinary
better
accommodated
to
their
taste
.
"
              
<EOS>
In
the
present
instance
,
the
host
or
author
,
in
opening
his
new
establishment
,
provided
no
bill
of
fare
.
 
<EOS>
Sensible
of
the
difficulties
of
such
an
undertaking
in
its
infancy
,
he
preferred
that
it
should
make
its
own
way
,
silently
and
gradually
,
or
make
no
way
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
made
its
way
,
and
is
doing
such
a
thriving
business
that
nothing
remains
for
him
but
to
add
,
in
the
words
of
the
good
old
civic
ceremony
,
now
that
one
dish
has
been
discussed
and
finished
,
and
another
smokes
upon
the
board
,
that
he
drinks
to
his
guests
in
a
loving
-
cup
,
and
bids
them
a
hearty
welcome
.

<EOS>
I
 
Master
Humphrey
,
from
his
clock
-
side
in
the
chimney
corner
 
<EOS>
THE
reader
must
not
expect
to
know
where
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
At
present
,
it
is
true
,
my
abode
may
be
a
question
of
little
or
no
import
to
anybody
;
but
if
I
should
carry
my
readers
with
me
,
as
I
hope
to
do
,
and
there
should
spring
up
between
them
and
me
feelings
of
homely
affection
and
regard
attaching
something
of
interest
to
matters
ever
so
slightly
connected
with
my
fortunes
or
my
speculations
,
even
my
place
of
residence
might
one
day
have
a
kind
of
charm
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Bearing
this
possible
contingency
in
mind
,
I
wish
them
to
understand
,
in
the
outset
,
that
they
must
never
expect
to
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
churlish
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
Friendless
<EOS>
I
can
never
be
,
for
all
mankind
are
my
kindred
,
and
I
am
on
ill
terms
with
no
one
member
of
my
great
family
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
many
years
I
have
led
a
lonely
,
solitary
life
;
---
what
wound
I
sought
to
heal
,
what
sorrow
to
forget
,
originally
,
matters
not
now
;
it
is
sufficient
that
retirement
has
become
a
habit
with
me
,
and
that
I
am
unwilling
to
break
the
spell
which
for
so
long
a
time
has
shed
its
quiet
influence
upon
my
home
and
heart
.
   
<EOS>
I
live
in
a
venerable
suburb
of
London
,
in
an
old
house
which
in
bygone
days
was
a
famous
resort
for
merry
roysterers
and
peerless
ladies
,
long
since
departed
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
silent
,
shady
place
,
with
a
paved
courtyard
so
full
of
echoes
,
that
sometimes
I
am
tempted
to
believe
that
faint
responses
to
the
noises
of
old
times
linger
there
yet
,
and
that
these
ghosts
of
sound
haunt
my
footsteps
as
I
pace
it
up
and
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
more
confirmed
in
this
belief
,
because
,
of
late
years
,
the
echoes
that
attend
my
walks
have
been
less
loud
and
marked
than
they
were
wo
nt
to
be
;
and
it
is
pleasanter
to
imagine
in
them
the
rustling
of
silk
brocade
,
and
the
light
step
of
some
lovely
girl
,
than
to
recognise
in
their
altered
note
the
failing
tread
of
an
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
Those
who
like
to
read
of
brilliant
rooms
and
gorgeous
furniture
would
derive
but
little
pleasure
from
a
minute
description
of
my
simple
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
dear
to
me
for
the
same
reason
that
they
would
hold
it
in
slight
regard
.
 
<EOS>
Its
worm
-
eaten
doors
,
and
low
ceilings
crossed
by
clumsy
beams
;
its
walls
of
wainscot
,
dark
stairs
,
and
gaping
closets
;
its
small
chambers
,
communicating
with
each
other
by
winding
passages
or
narrow
steps
<EOS>
;
its
many
nooks
,
scarce
larger
than
its
corner
-
cupboards
;
its
very
dust
and
dulness
,
are
all
dear
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
moth
and
spider
are
my
constant
tenants
;
for
in
my
house
the
one
basks
in
his
long
sleep
,
and
the
other
plies
his
busy
loom
secure
and
undisturbed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
pleasure
in
thinking
on
a
summer
's
day
how
many
butterflies
have
sprung
for
the
first
time
into
light
and
sunshine
from
some
dark
corner
of
these
old
walls
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
first
came
to
live
here
,
<EOS>
which
was
many
years
ago
,
the
neighbours
were
curious
to
know
who
I
was
,
and
whence
I
came
,
and
why
I
lived
so
much
alone
.
 
<EOS>
As
time
went
on
,
and
they
still
remained
unsatisfied
on
these
points
,
I
became
the
centre
of
a
popular
ferment
,
extending
for
half
a
mile
round
,
and
in
one
direction
for
a
full
mile
.
 
<EOS>
Various
rumours
were
circulated
to
my
prejudice
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
spy
,
an
infidel
,
a
conjurer
,
a
kidnapper
of
children
,
a
refugee
,
a
priest
,
a
monster
.
 
<EOS>
Mothers
caught
up
their
infants
and
ran
into
their
houses
as
I
passed
;
men
eyed
me
spitefully
,
and
muttered
threats
and
curses
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
the
object
of
suspicion
and
distrust
---
<EOS>
ay
,
of
downright
hatred
too
.
   
<EOS>
But
when
in
course
of
time
they
found
I
did
no
harm
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
inclined
towards
them
despite
their
unjust
usage
,
they
began
to
relent
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
my
footsteps
no
longer
dogged
,
as
they
had
often
been
before
,
and
observed
that
the
women
and
children
no
longer
retreated
,
but
would
stand
and
gaze
at
me
as
I
passed
their
doors
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
this
for
a
good
omen
,
and
waited
patiently
for
better
times
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
I
began
to
make
friends
among
these
humble
folks
;
and
though
they
were
yet
shy
of
speaking
,
would
give
them
"
good
day
,
"
and
so
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
little
time
,
those
whom
I
had
thus
accosted
would
make
a
point
of
coming
to
their
doors
and
windows
at
the
usual
hour
,
and
nod
or
courtesy
to
me
;
children
,
too
,
came
timidly
within
my
reach
,
and
ran
away
quite
scared
when
I
patted
their
heads
and
bade
them
be
good
at
school
.
 
<EOS>
These
little
people
soon
grew
more
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
From
exchanging
mere
words
of
course
with
my
older
neighbours
,
I
gradually
became
their
friend
and
adviser
,
the
depositary
of
their
cares
and
sorrows
,
and
sometimes
,
it
may
be
,
the
reliever
,
in
my
small
way
,
of
their
distresses
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
never
walk
abroad
but
<EOS>
pleasant
recognitions
and
smiling
faces
wait
on
Master
Humphrey
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
whim
of
mine
,
perhaps
as
a
whet
to
the
curiosity
of
my
neighbours
,
and
a
kind
of
retaliation
upon
them
for
their
suspicions
---
<EOS>
it
was
,
I
say
,
a
whim
of
mine
,
when
I
first
took
up
my
abode
in
this
place
,
to
acknowledge
no
other
name
than
Humphrey
.
<EOS>
With
my
detractors
,
I
was
Ugly
Humphrey
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
began
to
convert
them
into
friends
,
I
was
Mr
Humphrey
and
Old
Mr
Humphrey
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
settled
down
into
plain
Master
Humphrey
,
which
was
understood
to
be
the
title
most
pleasant
to
my
ear
;
and
so
completely
a
matter
of
course
has
it
become
,
that
sometimes
when
I
am
taking
my
morning
walk
in
my
little
courtyard
,
I
overhear
my
barber
---
who
has
a
profound
respect
for
me
,
and
would
not
,
I
am
sure
,
abridge
my
honours
for
the
world
---
holding
forth
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
,
touching
the
state
of
"
Master
Humphrey
's
"
health
,
and
communicating
to
some
friend
the
substance
of
the
conversation
that
he
and
Master
Humphrey
have
had
together
in
the
course
of
the
shaving
which
he
has
just
concluded
.
   
<EOS>
That
I
may
not
make
acquaintance
with
my
readers
under
false
pretences
,
or
give
them
cause
to
complain
hereafter
that
I
have
withheld
any
matter
which
it
was
essential
for
them
to
have
learnt
at
first
,
I
wish
them
to
know
---
and
I
smile
sorrowfully
to
think
that
the
time
has
been
when
the
confession
would
have
given
me
pain
---
that
I
am
a
misshapen
,
deformed
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
made
a
misanthrope
by
this
cause
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
stung
by
any
insult
,
nor
wounded
by
any
jest
upon
my
crooked
figure
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
child
I
was
melancholy
and
timid
,
but
that
was
because
the
gentle
consideration
paid
to
my
misfortune
sunk
deep
into
my
spirit
and
made
me
sad
,
even
in
those
early
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
but
a
very
young
creature
when
my
poor
mother
died
,
and
yet
I
remember
that
often
when
I
hung
around
her
neck
,
and
oftener
still
when
I
played
about
the
room
before
her
,
she
would
catch
me
to
her
bosom
,
and
bursting
into
tears
,
would
soothe
me
with
every
term
of
fondness
and
affection
.
 
<EOS>
God
knows
I
was
a
happy
child
at
those
times
,
---
happy
to
nestle
in
her
breast
,
---
happy
to
weep
when
she
did
,
---
happy
in
not
knowing
why
.
   
<EOS>
These
occasions
are
so
strongly
impressed
upon
my
memory
,
that
they
seem
to
have
occupied
whole
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
numbered
very
,
very
few
when
they
ceased
for
ever
,
but
before
then
their
meaning
had
been
revealed
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
all
children
are
imbued
with
a
quick
perception
of
childish
grace
and
beauty
,
and
a
strong
love
for
it
,
but
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
thought
that
I
remember
,
either
that
I
possessed
it
myself
or
that
I
lacked
it
,
but
I
admired
it
with
an
intensity
that
I
can
not
describe
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
knot
of
playmates
<EOS>
---
they
must
have
been
beautiful
,
for
I
see
them
now
---
were
clustered
one
day
round
my
mother
's
knee
in
eager
admiration
of
some
picture
representing
a
group
of
infant
angels
,
which
she
held
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Whose
the
picture
was
,
whether
it
was
familiar
to
me
or
otherwise
,
or
how
all
the
children
came
to
be
there
,
I
forget
;
<EOS>
I
have
some
dim
thought
it
was
my
birthday
,
but
the
beginning
of
my
recollection
is
that
we
were
all
together
in
a
garden
,
and
it
was
summer
weather
,
---
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
that
,
for
one
of
the
little
girls
had
roses
in
her
sash
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
many
lovely
angels
in
this
picture
,
and
I
remember
the
fancy
coming
upon
me
to
point
out
which
of
them
represented
each
child
there
,
and
that
when
I
had
gone
through
my
companions
,
I
stopped
and
hesitated
,
wondering
which
was
most
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
children
looking
at
each
other
,
and
my
turning
red
and
hot
,
and
their
crowding
round
to
kiss
me
,
saying
that
they
loved
me
all
the
same
;
and
then
,
and
when
the
old
sorrow
came
into
my
dear
mother
's
mild
and
tender
look
,
the
truth
broke
upon
me
for
the
first
time
,
and
I
knew
,
while
watching
my
awkward
and
ungainly
sports
,
how
keenly
she
had
felt
for
her
poor
crippled
boy
.
   
<EOS>
I
used
frequently
to
dream
of
it
afterwards
,
and
now
my
heart
aches
for
that
child
as
if
I
had
never
been
he
,
when
I
think
how
often
he
awoke
from
some
fairy
change
to
his
own
old
form
,
and
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
---
all
these
sorrows
are
past
.
 
<EOS>
My
glancing
at
them
may
not
be
without
its
use
,
for
it
may
help
in
some
measure
to
explain
why
I
have
<EOS>
all
my
life
been
attached
to
the
inanimate
objects
that
people
my
chamber
,
and
how
I
have
come
to
look
upon
them
rather
in
the
light
of
old
and
constant
friends
,
than
as
mere
chairs
and
tables
which
a
little
money
could
replace
at
will
.
   
<EOS>
Chief
and
<EOS>
first
among
all
these
is
my
Clock
,
---
my
old
,
cheerful
,
companionable
Clock
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
ever
convey
to
others
an
idea
of
the
comfort
and
consolation
that
this
old
Clock
has
been
for
years
to
me
!
   
<EOS>
It
is
associated
with
my
earliest
recollections
.
 
<EOS>
It
stood
upon
the
staircase
at
home
<EOS>
(
I
call
it
home
still
mechanically
)
,
nigh
sixty
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
for
that
;
but
it
is
not
on
that
account
,
nor
because
it
is
a
quaint
old
thing
in
a
huge
oaken
case
curiously
and
richly
carved
,
that
I
prize
it
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
incline
to
it
as
if
it
were
alive
,
and
could
understand
and
give
me
back
the
love
I
bear
it
.
   
<EOS>
And
what
other
thing
that
has
not
life
could
cheer
me
as
it
does
?
<EOS>
what
other
thing
that
has
not
life
(
I
will
not
say
how
few
things
that
have
)
could
have
proved
the
same
patient
,
true
,
untiring
friend
?
 
<EOS>
How
often
have
I
sat
in
the
long
winter
evenings
feeling
such
society
in
its
cricket
-
voice
,
that
raising
my
eyes
from
my
book
and
looking
gratefully
towards
it
,
the
face
reddened
by
the
glow
of
the
shining
fire
has
seemed
to
relax
from
its
staid
expression
and
to
regard
me
kindly
!
<EOS>
how
often
in
the
summer
twilight
,
when
my
thoughts
have
wandered
back
to
a
melancholy
past
,
have
its
regular
whisperings
recalled
them
to
the
calm
and
peaceful
present
!
<EOS>
how
often
in
the
dead
tranquillity
of
night
has
its
bell
broken
the
oppressive
silence
,
and
seemed
to
give
me
assurance
that
the
old
clock
was
still
a
faithful
watcher
at
my
chamber
-
door
!
 
<EOS>
My
easy
-
chair
,
my
desk
,
my
ancient
furniture
,
my
very
books
,
I
can
scarcely
bring
myself
to
love
even
these
last
like
my
old
clock
.
   
<EOS>
It
stands
in
a
snug
corner
,
midway
between
the
fireside
and
a
low
arched
door
leading
to
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
Its
fame
is
diffused
so
extensively
throughout
the
neighbourhood
,
that
I
have
often
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
the
publican
,
or
the
baker
,
and
sometimes
even
the
parish
-
clerk
,
petitioning
my
housekeeper
(
of
whom
I
shall
have
much
to
say
by
-
and
-
by
)
to
inform
him
the
exact
time
by
Master
Humphrey
's
clock
.
 
<EOS>
My
barber
,
to
whom
I
have
referred
,
would
sooner
believe
it
than
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
are
these
its
only
distinctions
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
acquired
,
I
am
happy
to
say
,
another
,
inseparably
connecting
it
not
only
with
my
enjoyments
and
reflections
,
but
with
those
of
other
men
;
as
I
shall
now
relate
.
   
<EOS>
I
lived
alone
here
for
a
long
time
without
any
friend
or
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
my
wanderings
by
night
and
day
,
at
all
hours
and
seasons
,
in
city
streets
and
quiet
country
parts
,
I
came
to
be
familiar
with
certain
faces
,
and
to
take
it
to
heart
as
quite
a
heavy
disappointment
if
they
failed
to
present
themselves
each
at
its
accustomed
spot
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
were
the
only
friends
I
knew
,
and
beyond
them
I
had
none
.
   
<EOS>
It
happened
,
however
,
when
I
had
gone
on
thus
for
a
long
time
,
that
I
formed
an
acquaintance
with
a
deaf
gentleman
,
which
ripened
into
intimacy
and
close
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
hour
,
I
am
ignorant
of
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
his
humour
to
conceal
it
,
or
he
has
a
reason
and
purpose
for
so
doing
.
 
<EOS>
In
either
case
,
I
feel
that
he
has
a
right
to
require
a
return
of
the
trust
he
has
reposed
;
and
as
he
has
never
sought
to
discover
my
secret
,
I
have
never
sought
to
penetrate
his
.
 
<EOS>
There
may
have
been
something
in
this
tacit
confidence
in
each
other
flattering
and
pleasant
to
us
both
,
and
it
may
have
imparted
in
the
beginning
an
additional
zest
,
perhaps
,
to
our
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
we
have
grown
to
be
like
brothers
,
and
still
I
only
know
him
as
the
deaf
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
retirement
has
become
a
habit
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
add
,
that
the
deaf
gentleman
and
I
have
two
friends
,
I
communicate
nothing
which
is
inconsistent
with
that
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
I
spend
many
hours
of
every
day
in
solitude
and
study
,
have
no
friends
or
change
of
friends
<EOS>
but
these
,
only
see
them
at
stated
periods
,
and
am
supposed
to
be
of
a
retired
spirit
by
the
very
nature
and
object
of
our
association
.
   
<EOS>
We
are
men
of
secluded
habits
,
with
something
of
a
cloud
upon
our
early
fortunes
,
whose
enthusiasm
,
nevertheless
,
has
not
cooled
with
age
,
whose
spirit
of
romance
is
not
yet
quenched
,
who
are
content
to
ramble
through
the
world
in
a
pleasant
dream
,
rather
than
ever
waken
again
to
its
harsh
realities
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
alchemists
who
would
extract
the
essence
of
perpetual
youth
from
dust
and
ashes
,
tempt
coy
Truth
in
many
light
and
airy
forms
from
the
bottom
of
her
well
,
and
discover
one
crumb
of
comfort
or
one
grain
of
good
in
the
commonest
and
least
-
regarded
matter
that
passes
through
our
crucible
.
 
<EOS>
Spirits
of
past
times
,
creatures
of
imagination
,
and
people
of
to
-
day
are
alike
the
objects
of
our
seeking
,
and
,
unlike
the
objects
of
search
with
most
philosophers
,
we
can
insure
their
coming
at
our
command
.
   
<EOS>
The
deaf
gentleman
<EOS>
and
I
first
began
to
beguile
our
days
with
these
fancies
,
and
our
nights
in
communicating
them
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
now
four
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
my
room
there
are
six
old
chairs
,
and
we
have
decided
that
the
two
empty
seats
shall
always
be
placed
at
our
table
when
we
meet
,
to
remind
us
that
we
may
yet
increase
our
company
by
that
number
,
if
we
should
find
two
men
to
our
mind
.
<EOS>
When
one
among
us
dies
,
his
chair
will
always
be
set
in
its
usual
place
,
but
never
occupied
again
;
and
I
have
caused
my
will
to
be
so
drawn
out
,
that
when
we
are
all
dead
the
house
shall
be
shut
up
,
and
the
vacant
chairs
still
left
in
their
accustomed
places
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
pleasant
to
think
that
even
then
our
shades
may
,
perhaps
,
assemble
together
as
of
yore
we
did
,
and
join
in
ghostly
converse
.
   
<EOS>
One
night
in
every
week
,
as
the
clock
strikes
ten
,
we
meet
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
second
stroke
of
two
,
I
am
alone
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
shall
I
tell
how
that
my
old
servant
,
besides
giving
us
note
of
time
,
and
ticking
cheerful
encouragement
of
our
proceedings
,
lends
its
name
to
our
society
,
which
for
its
punctuality
and
my
love
is
christened
"
Master
Humphrey
's
Clock
"
?
<EOS>
Now
shall
I
tell
how
that
in
the
bottom
of
the
old
dark
closet
,
where
the
steady
pendulum
throbs
and
beats
with
healthy
action
,
though
the
pulse
of
him
who
made
it
stood
still
long
ago
,
and
never
moved
again
,
there
are
piles
of
dusty
papers
constantly
placed
there
by
our
hands
,
that
we
may
link
our
enjoyments
with
my
old
friend
,
and
draw
means
to
beguile
time
from
the
heart
of
time
itself
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
,
or
can
I
,
tell
with
what
a
secret
pride
<EOS>
I
open
this
repository
when
we
meet
at
night
,
and
still
find
new
store
of
pleasure
in
my
dear
old
Clock
?
   
<EOS>
Friend
and
companion
of
my
solitude
!
<EOS>
mine
is
not
a
selfish
love
;
I
would
not
keep
your
merits
to
myself
,
but
disperse
something
of
pleasant
association
with
your
image
through
the
whole
wide
world
;
I
would
have
men
couple
with
your
name
cheerful
and
healthy
thoughts
;
I
would
have
them
believe
that
you
keep
true
and
honest
time
;
and
how
it
would
gladden
me
to
know
that
they
recognised
some
hearty
English
work
in
Master
Humphrey
's
clock
!

The
clock
-
case
 
<EOS>
It
is
my
intention
constantly
to
address
my
readers
from
the
chimney
-
corner
,
and
I
would
fain
hope
that
such
accounts
as
I
shall
give
them
of
our
histories
and
proceedings
,
our
quiet
speculations
or
more
busy
adventures
,
will
never
be
unwelcome
.
 
<EOS>
Lest
,
however
,
I
should
grow
prolix
in
the
outset
by
lingering
too
long
upon
our
little
association
,
confounding
the
enthusiasm
with
which
I
regard
this
chief
happiness
of
my
life
with
that
minor
degree
of
interest
which
those
to
whom
I
address
myself
may
be
supposed
to
feel
for
it
,
I
have
deemed
it
expedient
to
break
off
as
they
have
seen
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
still
clinging
to
my
old
friend
,
and
naturally
desirous
that
all
its
merits
should
be
known
,
I
am
tempted
to
open
(
somewhat
irregularly
and
against
our
laws
,
I
must
admit
)
<EOS>
the
clock
-
case
.
<EOS>
The
first
roll
of
paper
on
which
I
lay
my
hand
is
in
the
writing
of
the
deaf
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
to
speak
of
him
in
my
next
paper
;
and
how
can
I
better
approach
that
welcome
task
than
by
prefacing
it
with
a
production
of
his
own
pen
,
consigned
to
the
safe
keeping
of
my
honest
Clock
by
his
own
hand
?

Introduction
to
the
Giant
Chronicles
 
Once
upon
a
time
,
that
is
to
say
,
in
this
our
time
,
---
the
exact
year
,
month
,
and
day
are
of
no
matter
,
---
there
dwelt
in
the
city
of
London
a
substantial
citizen
,
who
united
in
his
single
person
the
dignities
of
wholesale
fruiterer
,
alderman
,
common
-
councilman
,
and
member
of
the
worshipful
Company
of
Patten
-
makers
;
who
had
superadded
to
these
extraordinary
distinctions
the
important
post
and
title
of
Sheriff
,
and
who
at
length
,
and
to
crown
all
,
stood
next
in
rotation
for
the
high
and
honourable
office
of
Lord
Mayor
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
substantial
citizen
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
was
like
the
full
moon
in
a
fog
,
with
two
little
holes
punched
out
for
his
eyes
,
a
very
ripe
pear
stuck
on
for
his
nose
,
and
a
wide
gash
to
serve
for
a
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
The
girth
of
his
waistcoat
was
hung
up
and
lettered
in
his
tailor
's
shop
as
an
extraordinary
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
He
breathed
like
a
heavy
snorer
,
and
his
voice
in
speaking
came
thickly
forth
,
as
if
it
were
oppressed
and
stifled
by
feather
-
beds
.
 
<EOS>
He
trod
the
ground
like
an
elephant
,
and
eat
and
drank
like
---
like
nothing
but
an
alderman
,
as
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
This
worthy
citizen
had
risen
to
his
great
eminence
from
small
beginnings
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
once
been
a
very
lean
,
weazen
<EOS>
little
boy
,
never
dreaming
of
carrying
such
a
weight
of
flesh
upon
his
bones
or
of
money
in
his
pockets
,
and
glad
enough
to
take
his
dinner
at
a
baker
's
door
,
and
his
tea
at
a
pump
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
long
ago
forgotten
all
this
,
as
it
was
proper
that
a
wholesale
fruiterer
,
alderman
,
common
-
councilman
,
member
of
the
worshipful
Company
of
Patten-
makers
,
past
sheriff
,
and
,
above
all
,
a
Lord
Mayor
that
was
to
be
,
should
;
and
he
never
forgot
it
more
completely
in
all
his
life
than
on
the
eighth
of
November
in
the
year
of
his
election
to
the
great
golden
civic
chair
,
which
was
the
day
before
his
grand
dinner
at
Guildhall
.
   
<EOS>
It
happened
that
as
he
sat
that
evening
all
alone
in
his
counting-
house
,
looking
over
the
bill
of
fare
for
next
day
,
and
checking
off
the
fat
capons
in
fifties
,
and
the
turtle
-
soup
by
the
hundred
quarts
,
for
his
private
amusement
,
---
it
happened
that
as
he
sat
alone
occupied
in
these
pleasant
calculations
,
a
strange
man
came
in
and
asked
him
how
he
did
,
adding
,
"
If
I
am
half
as
much
changed
as
you
,
sir
,
you
have
no
recollection
of
me
,
I
am
sure
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
strange
man
was
not
over
and
above
well
dressed
,
and
was
very
far
from
being
fat
or
rich
-
looking
in
any
sense
of
the
word
,
yet
he
spoke
with
a
kind
of
modest
confidence
,
and
assumed
an
easy
,
gentlemanly
sort
of
an
air
,
to
which
nobody
but
a
rich
man
can
lawfully
presume
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
this
,
he
interrupted
the
good
citizen
just
as
he
had
reckoned
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
fat
capons
,
and
was
carrying
them
over
to
the
next
column
;
and
as
if
that
were
not
aggravation
enough
,
the
learned
recorder
for
the
city
of
London
had
only
ten
minutes
previously
gone
out
at
that
very
same
door
,
and
had
turned
round
and
said
,
"
Good
night
,
my
lord
.
"
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
had
said
,
"
my
lord
;
"
---
he
,
a
man
of
birth
and
education
,
of
the
Honourable
Society
of
the
Middle
Temple
,
Barrister
-
at
-
Law
,
---
he
who
had
an
uncle
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
an
aunt
almost
but
not
quite
in
the
House
of
Lords
(
for
she
had
married
a
feeble
peer
,
and
made
him
vote
as
she
liked
)
,
---
he
,
this
man
,
this
learned
recorder
,
had
said
,
"
my
lord
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
wait
till
to
-
morrow
to
give
you
your
title
,
my
Lord
Mayor
,
"
says
he
,
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
;
"
you
are
Lord
Mayor
DE
FACTO
,
if
not
DE
JURE
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
Lord
Mayor
elect
thought
of
this
,
and
turning
to
the
stranger
,
and
sternly
bidding
him
"
go
out
of
his
private
counting
-
house
,
"
brought
forward
the
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
fat
capons
,
and
went
on
with
his
account
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
,
"
said
the
other
,
stepping
forward
,
---
<EOS>
"
DO
you
remember
little
Joe
Toddyhigh
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
port
wine
fled
for
a
moment
from
the
fruiterer
's
nose
as
he
muttered
,
"
Joe
Toddyhigh
!
 
<EOS>
What
about
Joe
Toddyhigh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
Joe
Toddyhigh
,
"
cried
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
,
look
hard
at
me
,
---
harder
,
harder
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
me
now
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
little
Joe
again
?
<EOS>
What
a
happiness
to
us
both
,
to
meet
the
very
night
before
your
grandeur
!
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
give
me
your
hand
,
Jack
,
---
both
hands
,
---
both
,
for
the
sake
of
old
times
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
pinch
me
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
-
hurting
of
me
,
"
said
the
Lord
Mayor
elect
pettishly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
---
suppose
anybody
should
come
,
---
Mr
Toddyhigh
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Toddyhigh
!
"
repeated
the
other
ruefully
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
do
n't
bother
,
"
said
the
Lord
Mayor
elect
,
scratching
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
thought
you
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
fellow
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
a
pretty
state
of
things
,
and
worthy
the
tone
of
vexation
and
disappointment
in
which
the
Lord
Mayor
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
Toddyhigh
had
been
a
poor
boy
with
him
at
Hull
,
and
had
oftentimes
divided
his
last
penny
and
parted
his
last
crust
to
relieve
his
wants
;
for
though
Joe
was
a
destitute
child
in
those
times
,
he
was
as
faithful
and
affectionate
in
his
friendship
as
ever
man
of
might
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
They
parted
one
day
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
different
directions
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
went
to
sea
,
and
the
now
wealthy
citizen
begged
his
way
to
London
<EOS>
,
They
separated
with
many
tears
,
like
foolish
fellows
as
they
were
,
and
agreed
to
remain
fast
friends
,
and
if
they
lived
,
soon
to
communicate
again
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
was
an
errand
-
boy
,
and
even
in
the
early
days
of
his
apprenticeship
,
the
citizen
had
many
a
time
trudged
to
the
Post-
office
to
ask
if
there
were
any
letter
from
poor
little
Joe
,
and
had
gone
home
again
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
when
he
found
no
news
of
his
only
friend
.
 
<EOS>
The
world
is
a
wide
place
,
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
letter
came
;
when
it
did
,
the
writer
was
forgotten
.
<EOS>
It
turned
from
white
to
yellow
from
lying
in
the
Post
-
office
with
nobody
to
claim
it
,
and
in
course
of
time
was
torn
up
with
five
hundred
others
,
and
sold
for
waste
-
paper
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
at
last
,
and
when
it
might
least
have
been
expected
,
here
was
this
Joe
Toddyhigh
turning
up
and
claiming
acquaintance
with
a
great
public
character
,
who
on
the
morrow
would
be
cracking
jokes
with
the
Prime
Minister
of
England
,
and
who
had
only
,
at
any
time
during
the
next
twelve
months
,
to
say
the
word
,
and
he
could
shut
up
Temple
Bar
,
and
make
it
no
thoroughfare
for
the
king
himself
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
,
Mr
Toddyhigh
,
"
said
the
Lord
Mayor
elect
;
"
I
really
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
inconvenient
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
have
given
twenty
pound
,
---
it
's
very
inconvenient
,
really
.
"
<EOS>
---
A
thought
had
come
into
his
mind
,
that
perhaps
his
old
friend
might
say
something
passionate
which
would
give
him
an
excuse
for
being
angry
himself
.
 
<EOS>
No
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Joe
looked
at
him
steadily
,
but
very
mildly
,
and
did
not
open
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
shall
pay
you
what
I
owe
you
,
"
said
the
Lord
Mayor
elect
,
fidgeting
in
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
lent
me
---
I
think
it
was
a
shilling
or
some
small
coin
---
when
we
parted
company
,
and
that
of
course
I
shall
pay
with
good
interest
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
pay
my
way
with
any
man
,
and
always
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
look
into
the
Mansion
House
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
---
some
time
after
dusk
,
---
and
ask
for
my
private
clerk
,
you
'll
find
he
has
a
draft
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
got
time
to
say
anything
more
just
now
,
unless
,
"
---
he
hesitated
,
for
,
coupled
with
a
strong
desire
to
glitter
for
once
in
all
his
glory
in
the
eyes
of
his
former
companion
,
was
a
distrust
of
his
appearance
,
which
might
be
more
shabby
than
he
could
tell
by
that
feeble
light
,
---
"
unless
you
'd
like
to
come
to
the
dinner
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
your
having
this
ticket
,
if
you
like
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
many
people
would
give
their
ears
for
it
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
old
friend
took
the
card
without
speaking
a
word
,
and
instantly
departed
.
 
<EOS>
His
sunburnt
face
and
gray
hair
were
present
to
the
citizen
's
mind
for
a
moment
;
but
by
the
time
he
reached
three
hundred
and
eighty
-
one
fat
capons
,
he
had
quite
forgotten
him
.
   
<EOS>
Joe
Toddyhigh
had
never
been
in
the
capital
of
Europe
before
,
and
he
wandered
up
and
down
the
streets
that
night
amazed
at
the
number
of
churches
and
other
public
buildings
,
the
splendour
of
the
shops
,
the
riches
that
were
heaped
up
on
every
side
,
the
glare
of
light
in
which
they
were
displayed
,
and
the
concourse
of
people
who
hurried
to
and
fro
,
indifferent
,
apparently
,
to
all
the
wonders
that
surrounded
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
all
the
long
streets
and
broad
squares
,
there
were
none
but
strangers
;
it
was
quite
a
relief
to
turn
down
a
by
-
way
and
hear
his
own
footsteps
on
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
home
to
his
inn
,
thought
that
London
was
a
dreary
,
desolate
place
,
and
felt
disposed
to
doubt
the
existence
of
one
true
-
hearted
man
in
the
whole
worshipful
Company
of
Patten
-
makers
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
he
went
to
bed
,
and
dreamed
that
he
and
the
Lord
Mayor
elect
were
boys
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
went
next
day
to
the
dinner
;
and
when
in
a
burst
of
light
and
music
,
and
in
the
midst
of
splendid
decorations
and
surrounded
by
brilliant
company
,
his
former
friend
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
Hall
,
and
was
hailed
with
shouts
and
cheering
,
he
cheered
and
shouted
with
the
best
,
and
for
the
moment
could
have
cried
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
he
cursed
his
weakness
in
behalf
of
a
man
so
changed
and
selfish
,
and
quite
hated
a
jolly
-
looking
old
gentleman
opposite
for
declaring
himself
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
a
Patten
-
maker
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
banquet
proceeded
,
he
took
more
and
more
to
heart
the
rich
citizen
's
unkindness
;
and
that
,
not
from
any
envy
,
but
because
he
felt
that
a
man
of
his
state
and
fortune
could
all
the
better
afford
to
recognise
an
old
friend
,
even
if
he
were
poor
and
obscure
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
he
thought
of
this
,
the
more
lonely
and
sad
he
felt
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
company
dispersed
and
adjourned
to
the
ball
-
room
,
he
paced
the
hall
and
passages
alone
,
ruminating
in
a
very
melancholy
condition
upon
the
disappointment
he
had
experienced
.
   
<EOS>
It
chanced
,
while
he
was
lounging
about
in
this
moody
state
,
that
he
stumbled
upon
a
flight
of
stairs
,
dark
,
steep
,
and
narrow
,
which
he
ascended
without
any
thought
about
the
matter
,
and
so
came
into
a
little
music
-
gallery
,
empty
and
deserted
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
elevated
post
,
which
commanded
the
whole
hall
,
he
amused
himself
in
looking
down
upon
the
attendants
who
were
clearing
away
the
fragments
of
the
feast
very
lazily
,
and
drinking
out
of
all
the
bottles
and
glasses
with
most
commendable
perseverance
.
   
<EOS>
His
attention
gradually
relaxed
,
and
he
fell
fast
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
,
he
thought
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
his
eyes
;
but
,
rubbing
them
a
little
,
he
soon
found
that
the
moonlight
was
really
streaming
through
the
east
window
,
that
the
lamps
were
all
extinguished
,
and
that
he
was
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
,
but
no
distant
murmur
in
the
echoing
passages
,
not
even
the
shutting
of
a
door
,
broke
the
deep
silence
;
he
groped
his
way
down
the
stairs
,
and
found
that
the
door
at
the
bottom
was
locked
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
now
to
comprehend
that
he
must
have
slept
a
long
time
,
that
he
had
been
overlooked
,
and
was
shut
up
there
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
His
first
sensation
,
perhaps
,
was
not
altogether
a
comfortable
one
,
for
it
was
a
dark
,
chilly
,
earthy
-
smelling
place
,
and
something
too
large
,
for
a
man
so
situated
,
to
feel
at
home
in
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
when
the
momentary
consternation
of
his
surprise
was
over
,
he
made
light
of
the
accident
,
and
resolved
to
feel
his
way
up
the
stairs
again
,
and
make
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
could
in
the
gallery
until
morning
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
turned
to
execute
this
purpose
,
he
heard
the
clocks
strike
three
.
   
<EOS>
Any
such
invasion
of
a
dead
stillness
as
the
striking
of
distant
clocks
,
causes
it
to
appear
the
more
intense
and
insupportable
when
the
sound
has
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
with
strained
attention
in
the
hope
that
some
clock
,
lagging
behind
its
fellows
,
had
yet
to
strike
,
---
looking
all
the
time
into
the
profound
darkness
before
him
,
until
it
seemed
to
weave
itself
into
a
black
tissue
,
patterned
with
a
hundred
reflections
of
his
own
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
bells
had
all
pealed
out
their
warning
for
that
once
,
and
the
gust
of
wind
that
moaned
through
the
place
seemed
cold
and
heavy
with
their
iron
breath
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
and
circumstances
were
favourable
to
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
keep
his
thoughts
to
the
current
,
unpleasant
though
it
was
,
in
which
they
had
moved
all
day
,
and
to
think
with
what
a
romantic
feeling
he
had
looked
forward
to
shaking
his
old
friend
by
the
hand
before
he
died
,
and
what
a
wide
and
cruel
difference
there
was
between
the
meeting
they
had
had
,
and
that
which
he
had
so
often
and
so
long
anticipated
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
he
was
disordered
by
waking
to
such
sudden
loneliness
,
and
could
not
prevent
his
mind
from
running
upon
odd
tales
of
people
of
undoubted
courage
,
who
,
being
shut
up
by
night
in
vaults
or
churches
,
or
other
dismal
places
,
had
scaled
great
heights
to
get
out
,
and
fled
from
silence
as
they
had
never
done
from
danger
.
 
<EOS>
This
brought
to
his
mind
the
moonlight
through
the
window
,
and
bethinking
himself
of
it
,
he
groped
his
way
back
up
the
crooked
stairs
,
---
but
very
stealthily
,
as
though
he
were
fearful
of
being
overheard
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
very
much
astonished
when
he
approached
the
gallery
again
,
to
see
a
light
in
the
building
:
 
still
more
so
,
on
advancing
hastily
and
looking
round
,
to
observe
no
visible
source
from
which
it
could
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
much
greater
yet
was
his
astonishment
at
the
spectacle
which
this
light
revealed
.
   
<EOS>
The
statues
of
the
two
giants
,
Gog
and
Magog
,
each
above
fourteen
feet
in
height
,
those
which
succeeded
to
still
older
and
more
barbarous
figures
,
after
the
Great
Fire
of
London
,
and
which
stand
in
the
Guildhall
to
this
day
,
were
endowed
with
life
and
motion
.
<EOS>
These
guardian
genii
of
the
City
had
quitted
their
pedestals
,
and
reclined
in
easy
attitudes
in
the
great
stained
glass
window
.
<EOS>
Between
them
was
an
ancient
cask
,
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
wine
;
for
the
younger
Giant
,
clapping
his
huge
hand
upon
it
,
and
throwing
up
his
mighty
leg
,
burst
into
an
exulting
laugh
,
which
reverberated
through
the
hall
like
thunder
.
   
<EOS>
Joe
Toddyhigh
instinctively
stooped
down
,
and
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
felt
his
hair
stand
on
end
,
his
knees
knock
together
,
and
a
cold
damp
break
out
upon
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
at
that
minute
curiosity
prevailed
over
every
other
feeling
,
and
somewhat
reassured
by
the
good
-
humour
of
the
Giants
and
their
apparent
unconsciousness
of
his
presence
,
he
crouched
in
a
corner
of
the
gallery
,
in
as
small
a
space
as
he
could
,
and
,
peeping
between
the
rails
,
observed
them
closely
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
the
elder
Giant
,
who
had
a
flowing
gray
beard
,
raised
his
thoughtful
eyes
to
his
companion
's
face
,
and
in
a
grave
and
solemn
voice
addressed
him
thus
:
    
<EOS>
First
Night
of
the
Giant
Chronicles
 
Turning
towards
his
companion
the
elder
Giant
uttered
these
words
in
a
grave
,
majestic
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
Magog
,
does
boisterous
mirth
beseem
the
Giant
Warder
of
this
ancient
city
?
 
<EOS>
Is
this
becoming
demeanour
for
a
watchful
spirit
over
whose
bodiless
head
so
many
years
have
rolled
,
so
many
changes
swept
like
empty
air
---
in
whose
impalpable
nostrils
the
scent
of
blood
and
crime
,
pestilence
,
cruelty
,
and
horror
,
has
been
familiar
as
breath
to
mortals
---
in
whose
sight
Time
has
gathered
in
the
harvest
of
centuries
,
and
garnered
so
many
crops
of
human
pride
,
affections
,
hopes
,
and
sorrows
?
 
<EOS>
Bethink
you
of
our
compact
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
wanes
;
feasting
,
revelry
,
and
music
have
encroached
upon
our
usual
hours
of
solitude
,
and
morning
will
be
here
apace
.
 
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
we
are
stricken
mute
again
,
bethink
you
of
our
compact
.
"
   
<EOS>
Pronouncing
these
latter
words
with
more
of
impatience
than
quite
accorded
with
his
apparent
age
and
gravity
,
the
Giant
raised
a
long
pole
(
which
he
still
bears
in
his
hand
)
and
tapped
his
brother
Giant
rather
smartly
on
the
head
;
indeed
,
the
blow
was
so
smartly
administered
,
that
the
latter
quickly
withdrew
his
lips
from
the
cask
,
to
which
they
had
been
applied
,
and
,
catching
up
his
shield
and
halberd
,
assumed
an
attitude
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
His
irritation
was
but
momentary
,
for
he
laid
these
weapons
aside
as
hastily
as
he
had
assumed
them
,
and
said
as
he
did
so
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Gog
,
old
friend
,
that
when
we
animate
these
shapes
which
the
Londoners
of
old
assigned
(
and
not
unworthily
)
to
the
guardian
genii
of
their
city
,
we
are
susceptible
of
some
of
the
sensations
which
belong
to
human
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
when
I
taste
wine
,
I
feel
blows
;
when
I
relish
the
one
,
I
disrelish
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
Gog
,
the
more
especially
as
your
arm
is
none
of
the
lightest
,
keep
your
good
staff
by
your
side
,
else
we
may
chance
to
differ
.
 
<EOS>
Peace
be
between
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
said
the
other
,
leaning
his
staff
in
the
window
-
corner
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
laugh
just
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
think
,
"
replied
the
Giant
Magog
,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
cask
,
"
of
him
who
owned
this
wine
,
and
kept
it
in
a
cellar
hoarded
from
the
light
of
day
,
for
thirty
years
,
---
"
till
it
should
be
fit
to
drink
,
"
quoth
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
twoscore
and
ten
years
old
when
he
buried
it
beneath
his
house
,
and
yet
never
thought
that
he
might
be
scarcely
"
fit
to
drink
"
when
the
wine
became
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
make
himself
unfit
to
be
eaten
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
very
little
of
him
left
by
this
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
night
is
waning
,
"
said
Gog
mournfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
replied
his
companion
,
"
and
I
see
you
are
impatient
.
<EOS>
But
look
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
eastern
window
---
placed
opposite
to
us
,
that
the
first
beams
of
the
rising
sun
may
every
morning
gild
our
giant
faces
---
the
moon
-
rays
fall
upon
the
pavement
in
a
stream
of
light
that
to
my
fancy
sinks
through
the
cold
stone
and
gushes
into
the
old
crypt
below
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
is
scarcely
past
its
noon
,
and
our
great
charge
is
sleeping
heavily
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
ceased
to
speak
,
and
looked
upward
at
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
of
their
large
,
black
,
rolling
eyes
filled
Joe
Toddyhigh
with
such
horror
that
he
could
scarcely
draw
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Still
they
took
no
note
of
him
,
and
appeared
to
believe
themselves
quite
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
compact
,
"
said
Magog
after
a
pause
,
"
is
,
if
I
understand
it
,
that
,
instead
of
watching
here
in
silence
through
the
dreary
nights
,
we
entertain
each
other
with
stories
of
our
past
experience
;
with
tales
of
the
past
,
the
present
,
and
the
future
;
with
legends
of
London
and
her
sturdy
citizens
from
the
old
simple
times
.
 
<EOS>
That
every
night
at
midnight
,
when
St
Paul
's
bell
tolls
out
one
,
and
we
may
move
and
speak
,
we
thus
discourse
,
nor
leave
such
themes
till
the
first
gray
gleam
of
day
shall
strike
us
dumb
.
<EOS>
Is
that
our
bargain
,
brother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
Giant
Gog
,
"
that
is
the
league
between
us
who
guard
this
city
,
by
day
in
spirit
,
and
by
night
in
body
also
;
and
never
on
ancient
holidays
have
its
conduits
run
wine
more
merrily
than
we
will
pour
forth
our
legendary
lore
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
old
chroniclers
from
this
time
hence
.
 
<EOS>
The
crumbled
walls
encircle
us
once
more
,
the
postern
-
gates
are
closed
,
the
drawbridge
is
up
,
and
pent
in
its
narrow
den
beneath
,
the
water
foams
and
struggles
with
the
sunken
starlings
.
 
<EOS>
Jerkins
and
quarter
-
staves
are
in
the
streets
again
,
the
nightly
watch
is
set
,
the
rebel
,
sad
and
lonely
in
his
Tower
dungeon
,
tries
to
sleep
and
weeps
for
home
and
children
.
 
<EOS>
Aloft
upon
the
gates
and
walls
are
noble
heads
glaring
fiercely
down
upon
the
dreaming
city
,
and
vexing
the
hungry
dogs
that
scent
them
in
the
air
,
and
tear
the
ground
beneath
with
dismal
howlings
.
 
<EOS>
The
axe
,
the
block
,
the
rack
,
in
their
dark
chambers
give
signs
of
recent
use
.
 
<EOS>
The
Thames
,
floating
past
long
lines
of
cheerful
windows
whence
come
a
burst
of
music
and
a
stream
of
light
,
bears
suddenly
to
the
Palace
wall
the
last
red
stain
brought
on
the
tide
from
Traitor
's
Gate
.
 
<EOS>
But
your
pardon
,
brother
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
wears
,
and
I
am
talking
idly
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
other
Giant
appeared
to
be
entirely
of
this
opinion
,
for
during
the
foregoing
rhapsody
of
his
fellow
-
sentinel
he
had
been
scratching
his
head
with
an
air
of
comical
uneasiness
,
or
rather
with
an
air
that
would
have
been
very
comical
if
he
had
been
a
dwarf
or
an
ordinary
-
sized
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
winked
too
,
and
though
it
could
not
be
doubted
for
a
moment
that
he
winked
to
himself
,
still
he
certainly
cocked
his
enormous
eye
towards
the
gallery
where
the
listener
was
concealed
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
all
,
for
he
gaped
;
and
when
he
gaped
,
Joe
was
horribly
reminded
of
the
popular
prejudice
on
the
subject
of
giants
,
and
of
their
fabled
power
of
smelling
out
Englishmen
,
however
closely
concealed
.
   
<EOS>
His
alarm
was
such
that
he
nearly
swooned
,
and
it
was
some
little
time
before
his
power
of
sight
or
hearing
was
restored
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
recovered
he
found
that
the
elder
Giant
was
pressing
the
younger
to
commence
the
Chronicles
,
and
that
the
latter
was
endeavouring
to
excuse
himself
on
the
ground
that
the
night
was
far
spent
,
and
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
Well
assured
by
this
that
he
was
certainly
about
to
begin
directly
,
the
listener
collected
his
faculties
by
a
great
effort
,
and
distinctly
heard
Magog
express
himself
to
the
following
effect
:
   
<EOS>
In
the
sixteenth
century
and
in
the
reign
of
Queen
Elizabeth
of
glorious
memory
(
albeit
her
golden
days
are
sadly
rusted
with
blood
)
,
there
lived
in
the
city
of
London
a
bold
young
'
prentice
who
loved
his
master
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
no
doubt
within
the
walls
a
great
many
'
prentices
in
this
condition
,
but
I
speak
of
only
one
,
and
his
name
was
Hugh
Graham
.
   
<EOS>
This
Hugh
was
apprenticed
to
an
honest
Bowyer
who
dwelt
in
the
ward
of
Cheype
,
and
was
rumoured
to
possess
great
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
Rumour
was
quite
as
infallible
in
those
days
as
at
the
present
time
,
but
it
happened
then
as
now
to
be
sometimes
right
by
accident
.
 
<EOS>
It
stumbled
upon
the
truth
when
it
gave
the
old
Bowyer
a
mint
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
His
trade
had
been
a
profitable
one
in
the
time
of
King
Henry
the
Eighth
,
who
encouraged
English
archery
to
the
utmost
,
and
he
had
been
prudent
and
discreet
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
to
pass
that
Mistress
Alice
,
his
only
daughter
,
was
the
richest
heiress
in
all
his
wealthy
ward
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Hugh
had
often
maintained
with
staff
and
cudgel
that
she
was
the
handsomest
.
 
<EOS>
To
do
him
justice
,
I
believe
she
was
.
   
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
gained
the
heart
of
pretty
Mistress
Alice
by
knocking
this
conviction
into
stubborn
people
's
heads
,
Hugh
would
have
had
no
cause
to
fear
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
the
Bowyer
's
daughter
smiled
in
secret
to
hear
of
his
doughty
deeds
for
her
sake
,
and
though
her
little
waiting
-
woman
reported
all
her
smiles
(
and
many
more
)
to
Hugh
,
and
though
he
was
at
a
vast
expense
in
kisses
and
small
coin
to
recompense
her
fidelity
,
he
made
no
progress
in
his
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
durst
not
whisper
it
to
Mistress
Alice
<EOS>
save
on
sure
encouragement
,
and
that
she
never
gave
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
glance
of
her
dark
eye
as
she
sat
at
the
door
on
a
summer
's
evening
after
prayer
-
time
,
while
he
and
the
neighbouring
'
prentices
exercised
themselves
in
the
street
with
blunted
sword
and
buckler
,
would
fire
Hugh
's
blood
so
that
none
could
stand
before
him
;
but
then
she
glanced
at
others
quite
as
kindly
as
on
him
,
and
where
was
the
use
of
cracking
crowns
if
Mistress
Alice
smiled
upon
the
cracked
as
well
as
on
the
cracker
?
   
<EOS>
Still
Hugh
went
on
,
and
loved
her
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
her
all
day
,
and
dreamed
of
her
all
night
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
treasured
up
her
every
word
and
gesture
,
and
had
a
palpitation
of
the
heart
whenever
he
heard
her
footstep
on
the
stairs
or
her
voice
in
an
adjoining
room
.
 
<EOS>
To
him
,
the
old
Bowyer
's
house
was
haunted
by
an
angel
;
there
was
enchantment
in
the
air
and
space
in
which
she
moved
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
no
miracle
to
Hugh
if
flowers
had
sprung
from
the
rush
-
strewn
floors
beneath
the
tread
of
lovely
Mistress
Alice
.
   
<EOS>
Never
did
'
prentice
long
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
eyes
of
his
lady
-
love
so
ardently
as
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
pictured
to
himself
the
house
taking
fire
by
night
,
and
he
,
when
all
drew
back
in
fear
,
rushing
through
flame
and
smoke
,
and
bearing
her
from
the
ruins
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
At
other
times
he
thought
of
a
rising
of
fierce
rebels
,
an
attack
upon
the
city
,
a
strong
assault
upon
the
Bowyer
's
house
in
particular
,
and
he
falling
on
the
threshold
pierced
with
numberless
wounds
in
defence
of
Mistress
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
could
only
enact
some
prodigy
of
valour
,
do
some
wonderful
deed
,
and
let
her
know
that
she
had
inspired
it
<EOS>
,
he
thought
he
could
die
contented
.
   
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
Bowyer
and
his
daughter
would
go
out
to
supper
with
a
worthy
citizen
at
the
fashionable
hour
of
six
o'clock
,
and
on
such
occasions
Hugh
,
wearing
his
blue
'
prentice
cloak
as
gallantly
as
'
prentice
might
,
would
attend
with
a
lantern
and
his
trusty
club
to
escort
them
home
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
the
brightest
moments
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
To
hold
the
light
while
Mistress
Alice
picked
her
steps
,
to
touch
her
hand
as
he
helped
her
over
broken
ways
,
to
have
her
leaning
on
his
arm
,
---
it
sometimes
even
came
to
that
,
---
this
was
happiness
indeed
!
   
<EOS>
When
the
nights
were
fair
,
Hugh
followed
in
the
rear
,
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
graceful
figure
of
the
Bowyer
's
daughter
as
she
and
the
old
man
moved
on
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
threaded
the
narrow
winding
streets
of
the
city
,
now
passing
beneath
the
overhanging
gables
of
old
wooden
houses
<EOS>
whence
creaking
signs
projected
into
the
street
,
and
now
emerging
from
some
dark
and
frowning
gateway
into
the
clear
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
At
such
times
,
or
when
the
shouts
of
straggling
brawlers
met
her
ear
,
the
Bowyer
's
daughter
would
look
timidly
back
at
Hugh
,
beseeching
him
to
draw
nearer
;
and
then
how
he
grasped
his
club
and
longed
to
do
battle
with
a
dozen
rufflers
,
for
the
love
of
Mistress
Alice
!
   
<EOS>
The
old
Bowyer
was
in
the
habit
of
lending
money
on
interest
to
the
gallants
of
the
Court
,
and
thus
it
happened
that
many
a
richly-
dressed
gentleman
dismounted
at
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
More
waving
plumes
and
gallant
steeds
,
indeed
,
were
seen
at
the
Bowyer
's
house
,
and
more
embroidered
silks
and
velvets
sparkled
in
his
dark
shop
and
darker
private
closet
,
than
at
any
merchants
in
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
In
those
times
no
less
than
in
the
present
it
would
seem
that
the
richest
-
looking
cavaliers
often
wanted
money
the
most
.
   
<EOS>
Of
these
glittering
clients
there
was
one
who
always
came
alone
.
<EOS>
He
was
nobly
mounted
,
and
,
having
no
attendant
,
gave
his
horse
in
charge
to
Hugh
while
he
and
the
Bowyer
were
closeted
within
.
 
<EOS>
Once
as
he
sprung
into
the
saddle
Mistress
Alice
was
seated
at
an
upper
window
,
and
before
she
could
withdraw
he
had
doffed
his
jewelled
cap
and
kissed
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
watched
him
caracoling
down
the
street
,
and
burnt
with
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
much
deeper
was
the
glow
that
reddened
in
his
cheeks
<EOS>
when
,
raising
his
eyes
to
the
casement
,
he
saw
that
Alice
watched
the
stranger
too
!
   
<EOS>
He
came
again
and
often
,
each
time
arrayed
more
gaily
than
before
,
and
still
the
little
casement
showed
him
Mistress
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
one
heavy
day
,
she
fled
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
cost
her
a
hard
struggle
,
for
all
her
old
father
's
gifts
were
strewn
about
her
chamber
as
if
she
had
parted
from
them
one
by
one
,
and
knew
that
the
time
must
come
when
these
tokens
of
his
love
would
wring
her
heart
,
---
yet
she
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
She
left
a
letter
commanding
her
poor
father
to
the
care
of
Hugh
,
and
wishing
he
might
be
happier
than
ever
he
could
have
been
with
her
,
for
he
deserved
the
love
of
a
better
and
a
purer
heart
than
she
had
to
bestow
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
's
forgiveness
(
she
said
)
<EOS>
she
had
no
power
to
ask
,
but
she
prayed
God
to
bless
him
,
---
and
so
ended
with
a
blot
upon
the
paper
where
her
tears
had
fallen
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
the
old
man
's
wrath
was
kindled
,
and
he
carried
his
wrong
to
the
Queen
's
throne
itself
;
but
there
was
no
redress
he
learnt
at
Court
,
for
his
daughter
had
been
conveyed
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
This
afterwards
appeared
to
be
the
truth
,
as
there
came
from
France
,
after
an
interval
of
several
years
,
a
letter
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
written
in
trembling
characters
,
and
almost
illegible
.
 
<EOS>
Little
could
be
made
out
save
that
she
often
thought
of
home
and
her
old
dear
pleasant
room
,
---
and
that
she
had
dreamt
<EOS>
her
father
was
dead
and
had
not
blessed
her
,
---
and
that
her
heart
was
breaking
.
   
<EOS>
The
poor
old
Bowyer
lingered
on
,
never
suffering
Hugh
to
quit
his
sight
,
for
he
knew
now
that
he
had
loved
his
daughter
,
and
that
was
the
only
link
that
bound
him
to
earth
.
 
<EOS>
It
broke
at
length
and
he
died
,
---
bequeathing
his
old
'
prentice
his
trade
and
all
his
wealth
,
and
solemnly
charging
him
with
his
last
breath
to
revenge
his
child
if
ever
he
who
had
worked
her
misery
<EOS>
crossed
his
path
in
life
again
.
   
<EOS>
From
the
time
of
Alice
's
flight
,
the
tilting
-
ground
,
the
fields
,
the
fencing
-
school
,
the
summer
-
evening
sports
,
knew
Hugh
no
more
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
was
dead
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
to
great
eminence
and
repute
among
the
citizens
,
but
was
seldom
seen
to
smile
,
and
never
mingled
in
their
revelries
or
rejoicings
.
 
<EOS>
Brave
,
humane
,
and
generous
<EOS>
,
he
was
beloved
by
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
pitied
too
by
those
who
knew
his
story
,
and
these
were
so
many
that
when
he
walked
along
the
streets
alone
at
dusk
,
even
the
rude
common
people
doffed
their
caps
and
mingled
a
rough
air
of
sympathy
with
their
respect
.
   
<EOS>
One
night
in
May
---
it
was
her
birthnight
,
and
twenty
years
since
she
had
left
her
home
<EOS>
---
Hugh
Graham
sat
in
the
room
she
had
hallowed
in
his
boyish
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
now
a
gray
-
haired
man
,
though
still
in
the
prime
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Old
thoughts
had
borne
him
company
for
many
hours
,
and
the
chamber
had
gradually
grown
quite
dark
,
when
he
was
roused
by
a
low
knocking
at
the
outer
door
.
   
<EOS>
He
hastened
down
,
and
opening
it
saw
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
which
he
had
seized
upon
the
way
,
a
female
figure
crouching
in
the
portal
.
 
<EOS>
It
hurried
swiftly
past
him
and
glided
up
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
for
pursuers
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
none
in
sight
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
not
one
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
inclined
to
think
it
a
vision
of
his
own
brain
,
when
suddenly
a
vague
suspicion
of
the
truth
flashed
upon
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
barred
the
door
,
and
hastened
wildly
back
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
she
was
,
---
there
,
in
the
chamber
he
had
quitted
,
---
there
in
her
old
innocent
,
happy
home
,
so
changed
that
none
<EOS>
but
he
could
trace
one
gleam
of
what
she
had
been
,
---
there
upon
her
knees
,
---
<EOS>
with
her
hands
clasped
in
agony
and
shame
before
her
burning
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
God
,
my
God
!
"
she
cried
,
"
now
strike
me
dead
!
 
<EOS>
Though
I
have
brought
death
and
shame
and
sorrow
on
this
roof
,
O
,
let
me
die
at
home
in
mercy
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
tear
upon
her
face
then
,
but
she
trembled
and
glanced
round
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
in
its
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
Her
bed
looked
as
if
she
had
risen
from
it
but
<EOS>
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
of
these
familiar
objects
,
marking
the
dear
remembrance
in
which
she
had
been
held
,
and
the
blight
she
had
brought
upon
herself
,
was
more
than
the
woman
's
better
nature
that
had
carried
her
there
could
bear
.
 
<EOS>
She
wept
and
fell
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
A
rumour
was
spread
about
,
in
a
few
days
'
time
,
that
the
Bowyer
's
cruel
daughter
had
come
home
,
and
that
Master
Graham
had
given
her
lodging
in
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
rumoured
too
that
he
had
resigned
her
fortune
,
in
order
that
she
might
bestow
it
in
acts
of
charity
,
and
that
he
had
vowed
to
guard
her
in
her
solitude
,
but
that
they
were
never
to
see
each
other
more
.
 
<EOS>
These
rumours
greatly
incensed
all
virtuous
wives
and
daughters
in
the
ward
,
especially
when
they
appeared
to
receive
some
corroboration
from
the
circumstance
of
Master
Graham
taking
up
his
abode
in
another
tenement
hard
by
.
 
<EOS>
The
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
,
however
,
forbade
any
questioning
on
the
subject
;
and
as
the
Bowyer
's
house
was
close
shut
up
,
and
nobody
came
forth
when
public
shows
and
festivities
were
in
progress
,
or
to
flaunt
in
the
public
walks
,
or
to
buy
new
fashions
at
the
mercers
'
booths
,
all
the
well
-
conducted
females
agreed
among
themselves
that
there
could
be
no
woman
there
.
   
<EOS>
These
reports
had
scarcely
died
away
when
the
wonder
of
every
good
citizen
,
male
and
female
,
was
utterly
absorbed
and
swallowed
up
by
a
Royal
Proclamation
,
in
which
her
Majesty
,
strongly
censuring
the
practice
of
wearing
long
Spanish
rapiers
of
preposterous
length
(
as
being
a
bullying
and
swaggering
custom
,
tending
to
bloodshed
and
public
disorder
)
,
commanded
that
on
a
particular
day
therein
named
,
certain
grave
citizens
should
repair
to
the
city
gates
,
and
there
,
in
public
,
break
all
rapiers
worn
or
carried
by
persons
claiming
admission
,
that
exceeded
,
though
it
were
only
by
a
quarter
of
an
inch
,
three
standard
feet
in
length
.
   
<EOS>
Royal
Proclamations
usually
take
their
course
,
let
the
public
wonder
never
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
appointed
day
two
citizens
of
high
repute
took
up
their
stations
at
each
of
the
gates
,
attended
by
a
party
of
the
city
guard
,
the
main
body
to
enforce
the
Queen
's
will
,
and
take
custody
of
all
such
rebels
(
if
any
)
as
might
have
the
temerity
to
dispute
it
:
 
and
a
few
to
bear
the
standard
measures
and
instruments
for
reducing
all
unlawful
sword
-
blades
to
the
prescribed
dimensions
.
 
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
these
arrangements
,
Master
Graham
and
another
were
posted
at
Lud
Gate
,
on
the
hill
before
St
Paul
's
.
   
<EOS>
A
pretty
numerous
company
were
gathered
together
at
this
spot
,
for
,
besides
the
officers
in
attendance
to
enforce
the
proclamation
,
there
was
a
motley
crowd
of
lookers
-
on
of
various
degrees
,
who
raised
from
time
to
time
such
shouts
and
cries
as
the
circumstances
called
forth
.
 
<EOS>
A
spruce
young
courtier
was
the
first
who
approached
:
 
<EOS>
he
unsheathed
a
weapon
of
burnished
steel
that
shone
and
glistened
in
the
sun
,
and
handed
it
with
the
newest
air
to
the
officer
,
who
,
finding
it
exactly
three
feet
long
,
returned
it
with
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
gallant
raised
his
hat
and
crying
,
"
God
save
the
Queen
!
"
<EOS>
passed
on
amidst
the
plaudits
of
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
another
---
a
better
courtier
still
---
who
wore
a
blade
but
two
feet
long
,
<EOS>
whereat
the
people
laughed
,
much
to
the
disparagement
of
his
honour
's
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
a
third
,
a
sturdy
old
officer
of
the
army
,
girded
with
a
rapier
at
least
a
foot
and
a
half
beyond
her
Majesty
's
pleasure
;
at
him
they
raised
a
great
shout
,
and
most
of
the
spectators
(
but
especially
those
who
were
armourers
or
cutlers
)
laughed
very
heartily
at
the
breakage
which
would
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
disappointed
;
for
the
old
campaigner
,
coolly
unbuckling
his
sword
and
bidding
his
servant
carry
it
home
again
,
passed
through
unarmed
,
to
the
great
indignation
of
all
the
beholders
.
 
<EOS>
They
relieved
themselves
in
some
degree
by
hooting
a
tall
blustering
fellow
with
a
prodigious
weapon
,
who
stopped
short
on
coming
in
sight
of
the
preparations
,
and
after
a
little
consideration
turned
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
this
time
no
rapier
had
been
broken
,
although
it
was
high
noon
,
and
all
cavaliers
of
any
quality
or
appearance
were
taking
their
way
towards
Saint
Paul
's
churchyard
.
   
<EOS>
During
these
proceedings
,
Master
Graham
had
stood
apart
,
strictly
confining
himself
to
the
duty
imposed
upon
him
,
and
taking
little
heed
of
anything
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
He
stepped
forward
now
as
a
richly-
dressed
gentleman
on
foot
,
followed
by
a
single
attendant
,
was
seen
advancing
up
the
hill
.
   
<EOS>
As
this
person
drew
nearer
,
the
crowd
stopped
their
clamour
,
and
bent
forward
with
eager
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Graham
standing
alone
in
the
gateway
,
and
the
stranger
coming
slowly
towards
him
,
they
seemed
,
as
it
were
,
set
face
to
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
nobleman
(
for
he
looked
one
)
had
a
haughty
and
disdainful
air
,
which
bespoke
the
slight
estimation
in
which
he
held
the
citizen
.
 
<EOS>
The
citizen
,
on
the
other
hand
,
preserved
the
resolute
bearing
of
one
who
was
not
to
be
frowned
down
or
daunted
,
and
who
cared
very
little
for
any
nobility
but
that
of
worth
and
manhood
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
perhaps
some
consciousness
on
the
part
of
each
,
of
these
feelings
in
the
other
,
that
infused
a
more
stern
expression
into
their
regards
as
they
came
closer
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
rapier
,
worthy
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
the
instant
that
he
pronounced
these
words
Graham
started
,
and
falling
back
some
paces
,
laid
his
hand
upon
the
dagger
in
his
belt
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
man
whose
horse
I
used
to
hold
before
the
Bowyer
's
door
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
that
man
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Out
,
you
'
prentice
hound
!
"
said
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
he
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
well
now
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Graham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
no
man
step
between
us
two
,
or
I
shall
be
his
murderer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
drew
his
dagger
,
and
rushed
in
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
had
drawn
his
weapon
from
the
scabbard
ready
for
the
scrutiny
,
before
a
word
was
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
thrust
at
his
assailant
,
but
the
dagger
which
Graham
clutched
in
his
left
hand
being
the
dirk
in
use
at
that
time
for
parrying
such
blows
,
promptly
turned
the
point
aside
.
 
<EOS>
They
closed
.
 
<EOS>
The
dagger
fell
rattling
on
the
ground
,
and
Graham
,
wresting
his
adversary
's
sword
from
his
grasp
,
plunged
it
through
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
drew
it
out
it
snapped
in
two
,
leaving
a
fragment
in
the
dead
man
's
body
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
passed
so
swiftly
that
the
bystanders
looked
on
without
an
effort
to
interfere
;
but
the
man
was
no
sooner
down
than
an
uproar
broke
forth
which
rent
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
attendant
rushing
through
the
gate
proclaimed
that
his
master
,
a
nobleman
,
had
been
set
upon
and
slain
by
a
citizen
<EOS>
;
the
word
quickly
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
;
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
and
every
book
-
shop
,
ordinary
,
and
smoking-
house
in
the
churchyard
poured
out
its
stream
of
cavaliers
and
their
followers
,
who
mingling
together
in
a
dense
tumultuous
body
,
struggled
,
sword
in
hand
,
towards
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
With
equal
impetuosity
,
and
stimulating
each
other
by
loud
cries
and
shouts
,
the
citizens
and
common
people
took
up
the
quarrel
on
their
side
,
and
encircling
Master
Graham
a
hundred
deep
,
forced
him
from
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
he
waved
the
broken
sword
above
his
head
,
crying
that
he
would
die
on
London
's
threshold
for
their
sacred
homes
.
 
<EOS>
They
bore
him
on
,
and
ever
keeping
him
in
the
midst
,
so
that
no
man
could
attack
him
,
fought
their
way
into
the
city
.
   
<EOS>
The
clash
of
swords
and
roar
of
voices
,
the
dust
and
heat
and
pressure
,
the
trampling
under
foot
of
men
,
the
distracted
looks
and
shrieks
of
women
at
the
windows
above
as
they
recognised
their
relatives
or
lovers
in
the
crowd
,
the
rapid
tolling
of
alarm
-
bells
,
the
furious
rage
and
passion
of
the
scene
,
were
fearful
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
,
being
on
the
outskirts
of
each
crowd
,
could
use
their
weapons
with
effect
,
fought
desperately
,
while
those
behind
,
maddened
with
baffled
rage
,
struck
at
each
other
over
the
heads
of
those
before
them
,
and
crushed
their
own
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
Wherever
the
broken
sword
was
seen
above
the
people
's
heads
,
towards
that
spot
the
cavaliers
made
a
new
rush
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
of
these
charges
was
marked
by
sudden
gaps
in
the
throng
where
men
were
trodden
down
,
but
as
fast
as
they
were
made
,
the
tide
swept
over
them
,
and
<EOS>
still
the
multitude
pressed
on
again
,
a
confused
mass
of
swords
,
clubs
,
staves
,
broken
plumes
,
fragments
of
rich
cloaks
and
doublets
,
and
angry
,
bleeding
faces
,
all
mixed
up
together
in
inextricable
disorder
.
   
<EOS>
The
design
of
the
people
was
to
force
Master
Graham
to
take
refuge
in
his
dwelling
,
and
to
defend
it
until
the
authorities
could
interfere
,
or
they
could
gain
time
for
parley
.
 
<EOS>
But
either
from
ignorance
or
in
the
confusion
of
the
moment
they
stopped
at
his
old
house
,
which
was
closely
shut
.
 
<EOS>
Some
time
was
lost
in
beating
the
doors
open
and
passing
him
to
the
front
.
 
<EOS>
About
a
score
of
the
boldest
of
the
other
party
threw
themselves
into
the
torrent
while
this
was
being
done
,
and
reaching
the
door
at
the
same
moment
with
himself
<EOS>
cut
him
off
from
his
defenders
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
turn
in
such
a
righteous
cause
,
so
help
me
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Graham
,
in
a
voice
that
at
last
made
itself
heard
,
and
confronting
them
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Least
of
all
will
I
turn
upon
this
threshold
which
owes
its
desolation
to
such
men
as
ye
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
no
quarter
,
and
I
will
have
none
!
 
<EOS>
Strike
!
"
   
<EOS>
For
a
moment
they
stood
at
bay
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
moment
a
shot
from
an
unseen
hand
,
apparently
fired
by
some
person
who
had
gained
access
to
one
of
the
opposite
houses
,
struck
Graham
in
the
brain
,
and
he
fell
dead
.
 
<EOS>
A
low
wail
was
heard
in
the
air
,
---
many
people
in
the
concourse
cried
that
they
had
seen
a
spirit
glide
across
the
little
casement
window
of
the
Bowyer
's
house
---
   
<EOS>
A
dead
silence
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
time
some
of
the
flushed
and
heated
throng
laid
down
their
arms
and
softly
carried
the
body
within
doors
.
 
<EOS>
Others
fell
off
or
slunk
away
in
knots
of
two
or
three
,
others
whispered
together
in
groups
,
and
before
a
numerous
guard
which
then
rode
up
could
muster
in
the
street
,
it
was
nearly
empty
.
   
<EOS>
Those
who
carried
Master
Graham
to
the
bed
up
-
stairs
were
shocked
to
see
a
woman
lying
beneath
the
window
with
her
hands
clasped
together
.
 
<EOS>
After
trying
to
recover
her
in
vain
,
they
laid
her
near
the
citizen
,
who
still
retained
,
tightly
grasped
in
his
right
hand
,
the
first
and
last
sword
that
was
broken
that
day
at
Lud
Gate
.
   
<EOS>
The
Giant
uttered
these
concluding
words
with
sudden
precipitation
;
and
on
the
instant
the
strange
light
which
had
filled
the
hall
faded
away
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
Toddyhigh
glanced
involuntarily
at
the
eastern
window
,
and
saw
the
first
pale
gleam
of
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
his
head
again
towards
the
other
window
in
which
the
Giants
had
been
seated
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
empty
.
 
<EOS>
The
cask
of
wine
was
gone
,
and
he
could
dimly
make
out
that
the
two
great
figures
stood
mute
and
motionless
upon
their
pedestals
.
   
<EOS>
After
rubbing
his
eyes
and
wondering
for
full
half
an
hour
,
during
which
time
he
observed
morning
come
creeping
on
apace
,
he
yielded
to
the
drowsiness
which
overpowered
him
and
fell
into
a
refreshing
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
it
was
broad
day
;
the
building
was
open
,
and
workmen
were
busily
engaged
in
removing
the
vestiges
of
last
night
's
feast
.
   
<EOS>
Stealing
gently
down
the
little
stairs
,
and
assuming
the
air
of
some
early
lounger
who
had
dropped
in
from
the
street
,
he
walked
up
to
the
foot
of
each
pedestal
in
turn
,
and
attentively
examined
the
figure
it
supported
.
 
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
features
of
either
;
he
recollected
the
exact
expression
they
had
worn
at
different
passages
of
their
conversation
,
and
recognised
in
every
line
and
lineament
the
Giants
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Assured
that
it
was
no
vision
,
but
that
he
had
heard
and
seen
with
his
own
proper
senses
,
he
walked
forth
,
determining
at
all
hazards
to
conceal
himself
in
the
Guildhall
again
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
He
further
resolved
to
sleep
all
day
,
so
that
he
might
be
very
wakeful
and
vigilant
,
and
above
all
that
he
might
take
notice
of
the
figures
at
the
precise
moment
of
their
becoming
animated
and
subsiding
into
their
old
state
,
which
he
greatly
reproached
himself
for
not
having
done
already
.

"
SIR
,
---
Before
you
proceed
any
further
in
your
account
of
your
friends
and
what
you
say
and
do
when
you
meet
together
,
excuse
me
if
I
proffer
my
claim
to
be
elected
to
one
of
the
vacant
chairs
in
that
old
room
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
reject
me
without
full
consideration
;
for
if
you
do
,
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
afterwards
---
<EOS>
you
will
,
upon
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
enclose
my
card
,
sir
,
in
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
ashamed
of
my
name
,
and
I
never
shall
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
considered
a
devilish
gentlemanly
fellow
,

I
act
up
to
the
character
.

If
you
want
a
reference
,
ask
any
of
the
men
at
our
club

Ask
any
fellow
who
goes
there
to
write
his
letters
,
what
sort
of
conversation
mine
is
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
him
if
he
thinks
I
have
the
sort
of
voice
that
will
suit
your
deaf
friend
and
make
him
hear
,
if
he
can
hear
anything
at
all

Ask
the
servants
what
they
think
of
me

There
's
not
a
rascal
among
'em
,
sir
,
but
will
tremble
to
hear
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
That
reminds
me
---
do
n't
you
say
too
much
about
that
housekeeper
of
yours
;
it
's
a
low
subject
,
damned
low
.
   
<EOS>

I
tell
you
what
,
sir

<EOS>
If
you
vote
me
into
one
of
those
empty
chairs
,
you
'll
have
among
you
a
man
with
a
fund
of
gentlemanly
information
that
'll
rather
astonish
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
let
you
into
a
few
anecdotes
about
some
fine
women
of
title
,
that
are
quite
high
life
,
sir
---
the
tiptop
sort
of
thing

<EOS>
I
know
the
name
of
every
man
who
has
been
out
on
an
affair
of
honour
within
the
last
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
;
I
know
the
private
particulars
of
every
cross
and
squabble
that
has
taken
place
upon
the
turf
,
at
the
gaming
-
table
,
or
elsewhere
,
during
the
whole
of
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
called
the
gentlemanly
chronicle
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
consider
yourself
a
lucky
dog
;
upon
my
soul
,
you
may
congratulate
yourself
,
though
I
say
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
uncommon
good
notion
that
of
yours
,
not
letting
anybody
know
where
you
live
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tried
it
,
but
there
has
always
been
an
anxiety
respecting
me
,
which
has
found
me
out

Your
deaf
friend

a
cunning
fellow
to
keep
his
name
so
close

have
tried
that
too

have
always
failed

shall
be
proud

make
his
acquaintance

him
so

my
compliments

You
must
have
been
a
queer
fellow

you

confounded
queer

odd

all

prosy

devilish
gentlemanly

In
places
like
that
I
could
come
in
with
great
effect
with
a
touch
of
life

do
n't
you
feel
that
?
   
<EOS>

I
am
anxiously
waiting
for
your
next
paper
to
know
whether
your
friends
live
upon
the
premises

and
at
your
expense
,
which
I
take
it
for
granted
is
the
case

If
I
am
right
in

delightful

who
will
be
proud
to
join
you

<EOS>
Some
years
ago
he
seconded
a
great
many
prize

fighters

and
once
fought
an
amateur

himself

since
then
he
has
driven
several

broken
at
different
periods
all
the
lamps
on
the
right

side
of
Oxford-

turning
off

In

gentlemanliness
he
is
unrivalled

he
is
of

Master
Humphrey
,
from
his
clock
-
side
in
the
chimney
-
corner
 
MY
<EOS>
old
companion
tells
me
it
is
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
The
fire
glows
brightly
,
crackling
with
a
sharp
and
cheerful
sound
,
as
if
it
loved
to
burn
.
<EOS>
The
merry
cricket
on
the
hearth
(
my
constant
visitor
)
,
this
ruddy
blaze
,
my
clock
,
and
I
,
seem
to
share
the
world
among
us
,
and
to
be
the
only
things
awake
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
,
high
and
boisterous
<EOS>
but
now
,
has
died
away
and
hoarsely
mutters
in
its
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
all
times
and
seasons
each
in
its
turn
,
and
am
apt
,
perhaps
,
to
think
the
present
one
the
best
;
but
past
or
coming
I
always
love
this
peaceful
time
of
night
,
when
long
-
buried
thoughts
,
favoured
by
the
gloom
and
silence
,
steal
from
their
graves
,
and
haunt
the
scenes
of
faded
happiness
and
hope
.
   
<EOS>
The
popular
faith
in
ghosts
has
a
remarkable
affinity
with
the
whole
current
of
our
thoughts
at
such
an
hour
as
this
,
and
seems
to
be
their
necessary
and
natural
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
For
who
can
wonder
that
man
should
feel
a
vague
belief
in
tales
of
disembodied
spirits
wandering
through
those
places
which
they
once
dearly
affected
,
when
he
himself
,
scarcely
less
separated
from
his
old
world
than
they
,
is
for
ever
lingering
upon
past
emotions
and
bygone
times
,
and
hovering
,
the
ghost
of
his
former
self
,
about
the
places
and
people
that
warmed
his
heart
of
old
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
thus
that
at
this
quiet
hour
I
haunt
the
house
where
I
was
born
,
the
rooms
I
used
to
tread
,
the
scenes
of
my
infancy
,
my
boyhood
,
and
my
youth
;
it
is
thus
that
I
prowl
around
my
buried
treasure
(
though
not
of
gold
or
silver
)
,
and
mourn
my
loss
;
it
is
thus
that
I
revisit
the
ashes
of
extinguished
fires
,
and
take
my
silent
stand
at
old
bedsides
.
 
<EOS>
If
my
spirit
should
ever
glide
back
to
this
chamber
when
my
body
is
mingled
with
the
dust
,
it
will
but
follow
the
course
it
often
took
in
the
old
man
's
lifetime
,
and
add
but
one
more
change
to
the
subjects
of
its
contemplation
.
   
<EOS>
In
all
my
idle
speculations
I
am
greatly
assisted
by
various
legends
connected
with
my
venerable
house
,
which
are
current
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
are
so
numerous
that
there
is
scarce
a
cupboard
or
corner
that
has
not
some
dismal
story
of
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
first
entertained
thoughts
of
becoming
its
tenant
,
I
was
assured
that
it
was
haunted
from
roof
to
cellar
,
and
I
believe
that
the
bad
opinion
in
which
my
neighbours
once
held
me
,
had
its
rise
in
my
not
being
torn
to
pieces
,
or
at
least
distracted
with
terror
,
on
the
night
I
took
possession
;
in
either
of
which
cases
I
should
doubtless
have
arrived
by
a
short
cut
at
the
very
summit
of
popularity
.
   
<EOS>
But
traditions
and
rumours
all
taken
into
account
,
who
so
abets
me
in
every
fancy
and
chimes
with
my
every
thought
,
as
my
dear
deaf
friend
?
<EOS>
and
how
often
have
I
cause
to
bless
the
day
that
brought
us
two
together
!
 
<EOS>
Of
all
days
in
the
year
I
rejoice
to
think
that
it
should
have
been
Christmas
Day
,
with
which
from
childhood
we
associate
something
friendly
,
hearty
,
and
sincere
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
walked
out
to
cheer
myself
with
the
happiness
of
others
,
and
,
in
the
little
tokens
of
festivity
and
rejoicing
,
of
which
the
streets
and
houses
present
so
many
upon
that
day
,
had
lost
some
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
stopped
to
look
at
a
merry
party
hurrying
through
the
snow
on
foot
to
their
place
of
meeting
,
and
now
turned
back
to
see
a
whole
coachful
of
children
safely
deposited
at
the
welcome
house
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
I
admired
how
carefully
the
working
man
carried
the
baby
in
its
gaudy
hat
and
feathers
,
and
how
his
wife
,
trudging
patiently
on
behind
,
forgot
even
her
care
of
her
gay
clothes
,
in
exchanging
greeting
with
the
child
as
it
crowed
and
laughed
over
the
father
's
shoulder
;
at
another
,
I
pleased
myself
with
some
passing
scene
of
gallantry
or
courtship
,
and
was
glad
to
believe
that
for
a
season
half
the
world
of
poverty
was
gay
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
day
closed
in
,
I
still
rambled
through
the
streets
,
feeling
a
companionship
in
the
bright
fires
that
cast
their
warm
reflection
on
the
windows
as
I
passed
,
and
losing
all
sense
of
my
own
loneliness
in
imagining
the
sociality
and
kind
-
fellowship
that
everywhere
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
happened
to
stop
before
a
Tavern
,
and
,
encountering
a
Bill
of
Fare
in
the
window
<EOS>
,
it
all
at
once
brought
it
into
my
head
to
wonder
what
kind
of
people
dined
alone
in
Taverns
upon
Christmas
Day
.
   
<EOS>
Solitary
men
are
accustomed
,
I
suppose
,
unconsciously
to
look
upon
solitude
as
their
own
peculiar
property
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
sat
alone
in
my
room
on
many
,
many
anniversaries
of
this
great
holiday
,
and
had
never
regarded
it
<EOS>
but
as
one
of
universal
assemblage
and
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
I
had
excepted
,
and
with
an
aching
heart
,
a
crowd
of
prisoners
and
beggars
;
but
THESE
were
not
the
men
for
whom
the
Tavern
doors
were
open
.
 
<EOS>
Had
they
any
customers
,
or
was
it
a
mere
form
?
<EOS>
---
a
form
,
no
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
Trying
to
feel
quite
sure
of
this
,
I
walked
away
;
but
before
I
had
gone
many
paces
,
I
stopped
and
looked
back
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
provoking
air
of
business
in
the
lamp
above
the
door
which
I
could
not
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
be
afraid
there
might
be
many
customers
---
young
men
,
perhaps
,
struggling
with
the
world
,
utter
strangers
in
this
great
place
,
whose
friends
lived
at
a
long
distance
off
,
and
whose
means
were
too
slender
to
enable
them
to
make
the
journey
.
<EOS>
The
supposition
gave
rise
to
so
many
distressing
little
pictures
,
that
in
preference
to
carrying
them
home
with
me
,
I
determined
to
encounter
the
realities
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
turned
and
walked
in
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
at
once
glad
and
sorry
to
find
that
there
was
only
one
person
in
the
dining
-
room
;
glad
to
know
that
there
were
not
more
,
and
sorry
that
he
should
be
there
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
look
so
old
as
I
,
but
like
me
he
was
advanced
in
life
,
and
his
hair
was
nearly
white
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
made
more
noise
in
entering
and
seating
myself
than
was
quite
necessary
,
with
the
view
of
attracting
his
attention
and
saluting
him
in
the
good
old
form
of
that
time
of
year
,
he
did
not
raise
his
head
,
but
sat
with
it
resting
on
his
hand
,
musing
over
his
half
-
finished
meal
.
   
<EOS>
I
called
for
something
which
would
give
me
an
excuse
for
remaining
in
the
room
<EOS>
(
I
had
dined
early
,
as
my
housekeeper
was
engaged
at
night
to
partake
of
some
friend
's
good
cheer
)
,
and
sat
where
I
could
observe
without
intruding
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
time
he
looked
up
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
that
somebody
had
entered
,
but
could
see
very
little
of
me
,
as
I
sat
in
the
shade
and
he
in
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sad
and
thoughtful
,
and
I
forbore
to
trouble
him
by
speaking
.
   
<EOS>
Let
me
believe
it
was
something
better
than
curiosity
which
riveted
my
attention
and
impelled
me
strongly
towards
this
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
so
patient
and
kind
a
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
should
have
been
surrounded
by
friends
,
and
yet
here
he
sat
dejected
and
alone
when
all
men
had
their
friends
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
As
often
as
he
roused
himself
from
his
reverie
he
would
fall
into
it
again
,
and
it
was
plain
that
,
whatever
were
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
,
they
were
of
a
melancholy
kind
,
and
would
not
be
controlled
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
not
used
to
solitude
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sure
of
that
;
for
I
know
by
myself
that
if
he
had
been
,
his
manner
would
have
been
different
,
and
he
would
have
taken
some
slight
interest
in
the
arrival
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
fail
to
mark
that
he
had
no
appetite
;
that
he
tried
to
eat
in
vain
;
that
time
after
time
the
plate
was
pushed
away
,
and
he
relapsed
into
his
former
posture
.
   
<EOS>
His
mind
was
wandering
among
old
Christmas
days
,
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
them
sprung
up
together
,
not
with
a
long
gap
between
each
,
but
in
unbroken
succession
like
days
of
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
change
to
find
himself
for
the
first
time
<EOS>
(
I
quite
settled
that
it
WAS
the
first
)
in
an
empty
silent
room
with
no
soul
to
care
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
following
him
in
imagination
through
crowds
of
pleasant
faces
,
and
then
coming
back
to
that
dull
place
with
its
bough
of
mistletoe
sickening
in
the
gas
,
and
sprigs
of
holly
parched
up
already
by
a
Simoom
of
roast
and
boiled
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
waiter
had
gone
home
;
and
his
representative
,
a
poor
,
lean
,
hungry
man
,
was
keeping
Christmas
in
his
jacket
.
   
<EOS>
I
grew
still
more
interested
in
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
His
dinner
done
,
a
decanter
of
wine
was
placed
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
remained
untouched
for
a
long
time
,
but
at
length
with
a
quivering
hand
he
filled
a
glass
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Some
tender
wish
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
give
utterance
on
that
day
,
or
some
beloved
name
that
he
had
been
used
to
pledge
,
trembled
upon
them
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
it
down
very
hastily
---
took
it
up
once
more
---
again
put
it
down
---
pressed
his
hand
upon
his
face
---
yes
---
<EOS>
and
tears
stole
down
his
cheeks
<EOS>
,
I
am
certain
.
   
<EOS>
Without
pausing
to
consider
whether
I
did
right
or
wrong
,
I
stepped
across
the
room
,
and
sitting
down
beside
him
laid
my
hand
gently
on
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
I
said
,
"
forgive
me
if
I
beseech
you
to
take
comfort
and
consolation
from
the
lips
of
an
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
preach
to
you
what
I
have
not
practised
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
be
your
grief
,
be
of
a
good
heart
---
be
of
a
good
heart
,
pray
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
you
speak
earnestly
,
"
he
replied
,
"
and
kindly
I
am
very
sure
,
but
---
"
   
I
nodded
my
head
to
show
that
I
understood
what
he
would
say
;
for
I
had
already
gathered
,
from
a
certain
fixed
expression
in
his
face
,
and
from
the
attention
with
which
he
watched
me
while
I
spoke
,
that
his
sense
of
hearing
was
destroyed
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
should
be
a
freemasonry
between
us
,
"
said
I
,
pointing
from
himself
to
me
to
explain
my
meaning
;
"
if
not
in
our
gray
hairs
,
at
least
in
our
misfortunes
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
I
am
but
a
poor
cripple
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
felt
so
happy
under
my
affliction
since
the
trying
moment
of
my
first
becoming
conscious
of
it
,
as
when
he
took
my
hand
in
his
with
a
smile
that
has
lighted
my
path
in
life
from
that
day
,
and
we
sat
down
side
by
side
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
beginning
of
my
friendship
with
the
deaf
gentleman
;
and
when
was
ever
the
slight
and
easy
service
of
a
kind
word
in
season
repaid
by
such
attachment
and
devotion
as
he
has
shown
to
me
!
   
<EOS>
He
produced
a
little
set
of
tablets
and
a
pencil
to
facilitate
our
conversation
,
on
that
our
first
acquaintance
;
and
I
well
remember
how
awkward
and
constrained
I
was
in
writing
down
my
share
of
the
dialogue
,
and
how
easily
he
guessed
my
meaning
before
I
had
written
half
of
what
I
had
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
in
a
faltering
voice
that
he
had
not
been
accustomed
to
be
alone
on
that
day
---
that
it
had
always
been
a
little
festival
with
him
;
and
seeing
that
I
glanced
at
his
dress
in
the
expectation
that
he
wore
mourning
,
he
added
hastily
that
it
was
not
that
;
if
it
had
been
he
thought
he
could
have
borne
it
better
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
time
to
the
present
we
have
never
touched
upon
this
theme
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
every
return
of
the
same
day
we
have
been
together
;
and
although
we
make
it
our
annual
custom
to
drink
to
each
other
hand
in
hand
after
dinner
,
and
to
recall
with
affectionate
garrulity
every
circumstance
of
our
first
meeting
,
we
always
avoid
this
one
as
if
by
mutual
consent
.
   
<EOS>
Meantime
we
have
gone
on
strengthening
in
our
friendship
and
regard
and
forming
an
attachment
which
,
I
trust
and
believe
,
will
only
be
interrupted
by
death
,
to
be
renewed
in
another
existence
.
 
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
how
we
communicate
as
we
do
;
but
he
has
long
since
ceased
to
be
deaf
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
frequently
my
companion
in
my
walks
,
and
even
in
crowded
streets
replies
to
my
slightest
look
or
gesture
,
as
though
he
could
read
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
vast
number
of
objects
which
pass
in
rapid
succession
before
our
eyes
,
we
frequently
select
the
same
for
some
particular
notice
or
remark
;
and
when
one
of
these
little
coincidences
occurs
,
I
can
not
describe
the
pleasure
which
animates
my
friend
,
or
the
beaming
countenance
he
will
preserve
for
half
-
an
-
hour
afterwards
at
least
.
   
<EOS>
He
is
a
great
thinker
from
living
so
much
within
himself
,
and
,
having
a
lively
imagination
,
has
a
facility
of
conceiving
and
enlarging
upon
odd
ideas
,
which
renders
him
invaluable
to
our
little
body
,
and
greatly
astonishes
our
two
friends
.
 
<EOS>
His
powers
in
this
respect
are
much
assisted
by
a
large
pipe
,
which
he
assures
us
once
belonged
to
a
German
Student
.
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
it
has
undoubtedly
a
very
ancient
and
mysterious
appearance
,
and
is
of
such
capacity
that
it
takes
three
hours
and
a
half
to
smoke
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
my
barber
,
who
is
the
chief
authority
of
a
knot
of
gossips
,
who
congregate
every
evening
at
a
small
tobacconist
's
hard
by
,
has
related
anecdotes
of
this
pipe
and
the
grim
figures
that
are
carved
upon
its
bowl
,
at
which
all
the
smokers
in
the
neighbourhood
have
stood
aghast
;
and
I
know
that
my
housekeeper
,
while
she
holds
it
in
high
veneration
,
has
a
superstitious
feeling
connected
with
it
which
would
render
her
exceedingly
unwilling
to
be
left
alone
in
its
company
after
dark
.
   
<EOS>
Whatever
sorrow
my
dear
friend
has
known
,
and
whatever
grief
may
linger
in
some
secret
corner
of
his
heart
,
he
is
now
a
cheerful
,
placid
,
happy
creature
.
 
<EOS>
Misfortune
can
never
have
fallen
upon
such
a
man
but
for
some
good
purpose
;
and
when
I
see
its
traces
in
his
gentle
nature
and
his
earnest
feeling
,
I
am
the
less
disposed
to
murmur
at
such
trials
as
I
may
have
undergone
myself
.
 
<EOS>
With
regard
to
the
pipe
,
I
have
a
theory
of
my
own
;
I
can
not
help
thinking
that
it
is
in
some
manner
connected
with
the
event
that
brought
us
together
;
for
I
remember
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
even
talked
about
it
;
that
when
he
did
,
he
grew
reserved
and
melancholy
;
and
that
it
was
a
long
time
yet
before
he
brought
it
forth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
curiosity
,
however
,
upon
this
subject
;
for
I
know
that
it
promotes
his
tranquillity
and
comfort
,
and
I
need
no
other
inducement
to
regard
it
with
my
utmost
favour
.
   
<EOS>
Such
is
the
deaf
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
call
up
his
figure
now
,
clad
in
sober
gray
,
and
seated
in
the
chimney
-
corner
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
puffs
out
the
smoke
from
his
favourite
pipe
,
he
casts
a
look
on
me
brimful
of
cordiality
and
friendship
,
and
says
all
manner
of
kind
and
genial
things
in
a
cheerful
smile
;
then
he
raises
his
eyes
to
my
clock
,
which
is
just
about
to
strike
,
and
,
glancing
from
it
to
me
and
back
again
,
seems
to
divide
his
heart
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
For
myself
,
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
I
would
gladly
part
with
one
of
my
poor
limbs
,
<EOS>
could
he
but
hear
the
old
clock
's
voice
.
   
<EOS>
Of
our
two
friends
,
the
first
has
been
all
his
life
one
of
that
easy
,
wayward
,
truant
class
whom
the
world
is
accustomed
to
designate
as
nobody
's
enemies
but
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
Bred
to
a
profession
for
which
he
never
qualified
himself
,
and
reared
in
the
expectation
of
a
fortune
he
has
never
inherited
,
he
has
undergone
every
vicissitude
of
which
such
an
existence
is
capable
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
younger
brother
,
both
orphans
from
their
childhood
,
were
educated
by
a
wealthy
relative
,
who
taught
them
to
expect
an
equal
division
of
his
property
;
but
too
indolent
to
court
,
and
too
honest
to
flatter
,
the
elder
gradually
lost
ground
in
the
affections
of
a
capricious
old
man
,
and
the
younger
,
who
did
not
fail
to
improve
his
opportunity
,
now
triumphs
in
the
possession
of
enormous
wealth
.
<EOS>
His
triumph
is
to
hoard
it
in
solitary
wretchedness
,
and
probably
to
feel
with
the
expenditure
of
every
shilling
a
greater
pang
than
the
loss
of
his
whole
inheritance
ever
cost
his
brother
.
   
<EOS>
Jack
Redburn
---
he
was
Jack
Redburn
at
the
first
little
school
he
went
to
,
where
every
other
child
was
mastered
and
surnamed
,
and
he
has
been
Jack
Redburn
<EOS>
all
his
life
,
or
<EOS>
he
would
perhaps
have
been
a
richer
man
by
this
time
---
has
been
an
inmate
of
my
house
these
eight
years
past
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
my
librarian
,
secretary
,
steward
,
and
first
minister
;
director
of
all
my
affairs
,
and
inspector
-
general
of
my
household
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
something
of
a
musician
,
something
of
an
author
,
something
of
an
actor
,
something
of
a
painter
,
very
much
of
a
carpenter
,
and
an
extraordinary
gardener
,
having
had
all
his
life
a
wonderful
aptitude
for
learning
everything
that
was
of
no
use
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
remarkably
fond
of
children
,
and
is
the
best
and
kindest
nurse
in
sickness
that
ever
drew
the
breath
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
mixed
with
every
grade
of
society
,
and
known
the
utmost
distress
;
but
there
never
was
a
less
selfish
,
a
more
tender-
hearted
,
a
more
enthusiastic
,
or
a
more
guileless
man
;
and
I
dare
say
,
if
few
have
done
less
good
,
fewer
still
have
done
less
harm
in
the
world
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
By
what
chance
Nature
forms
such
whimsical
jumbles
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
;
<EOS>
but
I
do
know
that
she
sends
them
among
us
very
often
,
and
that
the
king
of
the
whole
race
is
Jack
Redburn
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
be
puzzled
to
say
how
old
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
His
health
is
none
of
the
best
,
and
he
wears
a
quantity
of
iron
-
gray
hair
,
which
shades
his
face
and
gives
it
rather
a
worn
appearance
;
but
we
consider
him
quite
a
young
fellow
notwithstanding
;
and
if
a
youthful
spirit
,
surviving
the
roughest
contact
with
the
world
,
confers
upon
its
possessor
any
title
to
be
considered
young
,
then
he
is
a
mere
child
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
interruptions
to
his
careless
cheerfulness
are
on
a
wet
Sunday
,
when
he
is
apt
to
be
unusually
religious
and
solemn
,
and
sometimes
of
an
evening
,
when
he
has
been
blowing
a
very
slow
tune
on
the
flute
.
 
<EOS>
On
these
last
-
named
occasions
he
is
apt
to
incline
towards
the
mysterious
,
or
the
terrible
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
specimen
of
his
powers
in
this
mood
,
I
refer
my
readers
to
the
extract
from
the
clock
-
case
which
follows
this
paper
:
 
<EOS>
he
brought
it
to
me
not
long
ago
at
midnight
,
and
informed
me
that
the
main
incident
had
been
suggested
by
a
dream
of
the
night
before
.
   
<EOS>
His
apartments
are
two
cheerful
rooms
looking
towards
the
garden
,
and
one
of
his
great
delights
is
to
arrange
and
rearrange
the
furniture
in
these
chambers
,
and
put
it
in
every
possible
variety
of
position
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
whole
time
he
has
been
here
,
I
do
not
think
he
has
slept
for
two
nights
running
with
the
head
of
his
bed
in
the
same
place
;
and
every
time
he
moves
it
,
is
to
be
the
last
.
<EOS>
My
housekeeper
was
at
first
well
-
nigh
distracted
by
these
frequent
changes
;
but
she
has
become
quite
reconciled
to
them
by
degrees
,
and
has
so
fallen
in
with
his
humour
,
that
they
often
consult
together
with
great
gravity
upon
the
next
final
alteration
.
<EOS>
Whatever
his
arrangements
are
,
however
,
they
are
always
a
pattern
of
neatness
;
and
every
one
of
the
manifold
articles
connected
with
his
manifold
occupations
is
to
be
found
in
its
own
particular
place
.
 
<EOS>
Until
within
the
last
two
or
three
years
he
was
subject
to
an
occasional
fit
(
which
usually
came
upon
him
in
very
fine
weather
)
,
under
the
influence
of
which
he
would
dress
himself
with
peculiar
care
,
and
,
going
out
under
pretence
of
taking
a
walk
,
disappeared
for
several
days
together
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
the
interval
between
each
outbreak
of
this
disorder
had
gradually
grown
longer
and
longer
,
it
wholly
disappeared
;
and
now
he
seldom
stirs
abroad
,
except
to
stroll
out
a
little
way
on
a
summer
's
evening
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
yet
mistrusts
his
own
constancy
in
this
respect
,
and
is
therefore
afraid
to
wear
a
coat
,
I
know
not
;
but
we
seldom
see
him
in
any
other
upper
garment
than
an
old
spectral
-
looking
dressing-
gown
,
with
very
disproportionate
pockets
,
full
of
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
odd
matters
,
which
he
picks
up
wherever
he
can
lay
his
hands
upon
them
.
   
<EOS>
Everything
that
is
a
favourite
with
our
friend
is
a
favourite
with
us
;
and
thus
it
happens
that
the
fourth
among
us
is
Mr
Owen
Miles
,
a
most
worthy
gentleman
,
who
had
treated
Jack
with
great
kindness
before
my
deaf
friend
and
I
encountered
him
by
an
accident
,
to
which
I
may
refer
on
some
future
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Miles
was
once
a
very
rich
merchant
;
but
receiving
a
severe
shock
in
the
death
of
his
wife
,
he
retired
from
business
,
and
devoted
himself
to
a
quiet
,
unostentatious
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
an
excellent
man
,
of
thoroughly
sterling
character
:
 
not
of
quick
apprehension
,
and
not
without
some
amusing
prejudices
,
which
I
shall
leave
to
their
own
development
.
 
<EOS>
He
holds
us
all
in
profound
veneration
;
but
Jack
Redburn
he
esteems
as
a
kind
of
pleasant
wonder
,
that
he
may
venture
to
approach
familiarly
.
 
<EOS>
He
believes
,
not
only
that
no
man
ever
lived
who
could
do
so
many
things
as
Jack
,
but
that
no
man
ever
lived
who
could
do
anything
so
well
;
and
he
never
calls
my
attention
to
any
of
his
ingenious
proceedings
,
but
he
whispers
in
my
ear
,
nudging
me
at
the
same
time
with
his
elbow
:
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
only
made
it
his
trade
,
sir
---
if
he
had
only
made
it
his
trade
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
are
inseparable
companions
;
one
would
almost
suppose
that
,
although
Mr
Miles
never
by
any
chance
does
anything
in
the
way
of
assistance
,
Jack
could
do
nothing
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
is
reading
,
writing
,
painting
,
carpentering
,
gardening
,
flute
-
playing
,
or
what
not
,
there
is
Mr
Miles
beside
him
,
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
in
his
blue
coat
,
and
looking
on
with
a
face
of
incredulous
delight
,
as
though
he
could
not
credit
the
testimony
of
his
own
senses
,
and
had
a
misgiving
that
no
man
could
be
so
clever
but
in
a
dream
.
   
<EOS>
These
are
my
friends
;
I
have
now
introduced
myself
and
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
clock
-
case
A
confession
found
in
a
prison
in
the
time
of
Charles
<EOS>
the
Second
 
<EOS>
I
held
a
lieutenant
's
commission
in
his
Majesty
's
army
,
and
served
abroad
in
the
campaigns
of
1677
and
1678
.
 
<EOS>
The
treaty
of
Nimeguen
being
concluded
,
I
returned
home
,
and
retiring
from
the
service
,
withdrew
to
a
small
estate
lying
a
few
miles
east
of
London
,
which
I
had
recently
acquired
in
right
of
my
wife
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
the
last
night
I
have
to
live
,
and
I
will
set
down
the
naked
truth
without
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
never
a
brave
man
,
and
had
always
been
from
my
childhood
of
a
secret
,
sullen
,
distrustful
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
of
myself
as
if
I
had
passed
from
the
world
;
for
while
I
write
this
,
my
grave
is
digging
,
and
my
name
is
written
in
the
black
-
book
of
death
.
   
<EOS>
Soon
after
my
return
to
England
,
my
only
brother
was
seized
with
mortal
illness
.
 
<EOS>
This
circumstance
gave
me
slight
or
no
pain
;
for
since
we
had
been
men
,
we
had
associated
but
very
little
together
.
<EOS>
He
was
open
-
hearted
and
generous
,
handsomer
than
I
,
more
accomplished
,
and
generally
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
sought
my
acquaintance
abroad
or
at
home
,
because
they
were
friends
of
his
,
seldom
attached
themselves
to
me
long
,
and
would
usually
say
,
in
our
first
conversation
,
that
they
were
surprised
to
find
two
brothers
so
unlike
in
their
manners
and
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
my
habit
to
lead
them
on
to
this
avowal
;
for
I
knew
what
comparisons
they
must
draw
between
us
;
and
having
a
rankling
envy
in
my
heart
,
I
sought
to
justify
it
to
myself
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
married
two
sisters
.
 
<EOS>
This
additional
tie
between
us
,
as
it
may
appear
to
some
,
only
estranged
us
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
knew
me
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
struggled
with
any
secret
jealousy
or
gall
when
she
was
present
but
that
woman
knew
it
as
well
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
raised
my
eyes
at
such
times
<EOS>
but
I
found
hers
fixed
upon
me
;
I
never
bent
them
on
the
ground
or
looked
another
way
<EOS>
but
I
felt
that
she
overlooked
me
always
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
inexpressible
relief
to
me
when
we
quarrelled
,
and
a
greater
relief
still
when
I
heard
abroad
that
she
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
now
as
if
some
strange
and
terrible
foreshadowing
of
what
has
happened
since
must
have
hung
over
us
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
of
her
;
she
haunted
me
;
her
fixed
and
steady
look
comes
back
upon
me
now
,
like
the
memory
of
a
dark
dream
,
and
makes
my
blood
run
cold
.
   
<EOS>
She
died
shortly
after
giving
birth
to
a
child
---
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
When
my
brother
knew
that
all
hope
of
his
own
recovery
was
past
,
he
called
my
wife
to
his
bedside
,
and
confided
this
orphan
,
a
child
of
four
years
old
,
to
her
protection
.
 
<EOS>
He
bequeathed
to
him
all
the
property
he
had
,
and
willed
that
,
in
case
of
his
child
's
death
,
it
should
pass
to
my
wife
,
as
the
only
acknowledgment
he
could
make
her
for
her
care
and
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
exchanged
a
few
brotherly
words
with
me
,
deploring
our
long
separation
;
and
being
exhausted
,
fell
into
a
slumber
,
from
which
he
never
awoke
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
no
children
;
and
as
there
had
been
a
strong
affection
between
the
sisters
,
and
my
wife
had
almost
supplied
the
place
of
a
mother
to
this
boy
,
she
loved
him
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
was
ardently
attached
to
her
;
but
he
was
his
mother
's
image
in
face
and
spirit
,
and
always
mistrusted
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
fix
the
date
when
the
feeling
first
came
upon
me
;
but
I
soon
began
to
be
uneasy
when
this
child
was
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
roused
myself
from
some
moody
train
of
thought
<EOS>
but
I
marked
him
looking
at
me
;
not
with
mere
childish
wonder
,
but
with
something
of
the
purpose
and
meaning
that
I
had
so
often
noted
in
his
mother
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
effort
of
my
fancy
,
founded
on
close
resemblance
of
feature
and
expression
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
look
the
boy
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
feared
me
,
but
seemed
by
some
instinct
to
despise
me
while
he
did
so
;
and
even
when
he
drew
back
beneath
my
gaze
---
as
he
would
when
we
were
alone
,
to
get
nearer
to
the
door
---
he
would
keep
his
bright
eyes
upon
me
still
.
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
hide
the
truth
from
myself
,
but
I
do
not
think
that
,
when
this
began
,
I
meditated
to
do
him
any
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
thought
how
serviceable
his
inheritance
would
be
to
us
,
and
may
have
wished
him
dead
;
but
I
believe
I
had
no
thought
of
compassing
his
death
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
the
idea
come
upon
me
at
once
,
but
by
very
slow
degrees
,
presenting
itself
at
first
in
dim
shapes
at
a
very
great
distance
,
as
men
may
think
of
an
earthquake
or
the
last
day
;
then
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
,
and
losing
something
of
its
horror
and
improbability
;
then
coming
to
be
part
and
parcel
---
<EOS>
nay
nearly
the
whole
sum
and
substance
---
of
my
daily
thoughts
,
and
resolving
itself
into
a
question
of
means
and
safety
;
not
of
doing
or
abstaining
from
the
deed
.
   
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
within
me
,
I
never
could
bear
that
the
child
should
see
me
looking
at
him
,
and
yet
I
was
under
a
fascination
which
made
it
a
kind
of
business
with
me
to
contemplate
his
slight
and
fragile
figure
and
think
how
easily
it
might
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
would
steal
up
-
stairs
and
watch
him
as
he
slept
;
but
usually
I
hovered
in
the
garden
near
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
he
learnt
his
little
tasks
;
and
there
,
as
he
sat
upon
a
low
seat
beside
my
wife
,
I
would
peer
at
him
for
hours
together
from
behind
a
tree
;
starting
,
like
the
guilty
wretch
I
was
,
at
every
rustling
of
a
leaf
,
and
still
gliding
back
to
look
and
start
again
.
   
<EOS>
Hard
by
our
cottage
,
but
quite
out
of
sight
,
and
(
if
there
were
any
wind
astir
)
of
hearing
too
,
was
a
deep
sheet
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
spent
days
in
shaping
with
my
pocket
-
knife
a
rough
model
of
a
boat
,
which
I
finished
at
last
and
dropped
in
the
child
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
withdrew
to
a
secret
place
,
which
he
must
pass
if
he
stole
away
alone
to
swim
this
bauble
,
and
lurked
there
for
his
coming
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
neither
that
day
nor
the
next
,
though
I
waited
from
noon
till
nightfall
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sure
that
I
had
him
in
my
net
,
<EOS>
for
I
had
heard
him
prattling
of
the
toy
,
and
knew
that
in
his
infant
pleasure
he
kept
it
by
his
side
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
no
weariness
or
fatigue
,
but
waited
patiently
,
and
on
the
third
day
he
passed
me
,
running
joyously
along
,
with
his
silken
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
,
and
he
singing
---
God
have
mercy
upon
me
!
<EOS>
---
singing
a
merry
ballad
,
---
who
could
hardly
lisp
the
words
.
   
<EOS>
I
stole
down
after
him
,
creeping
under
certain
shrubs
which
grow
in
that
place
,
and
none
but
devils
know
with
what
terror
<EOS>
I
,
a
strong
,
full
-
grown
man
,
tracked
the
footsteps
of
that
baby
as
he
approached
the
water
's
brink
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
close
upon
him
,
had
sunk
upon
my
knee
and
raised
my
hand
to
thrust
him
in
,
when
he
saw
my
shadow
in
the
stream
and
turned
him
round
.
   
<EOS>
His
mother
's
ghost
was
looking
from
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
burst
forth
from
behind
a
cloud
;
it
shone
in
the
bright
sky
,
the
glistening
earth
,
the
clear
water
,
the
sparkling
drops
of
rain
upon
the
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
eyes
in
everything
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
great
universe
of
light
was
there
to
see
the
murder
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
he
said
;
he
came
of
bold
and
manly
blood
,
and
,
child
as
he
was
,
he
did
not
crouch
or
fawn
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
him
cry
that
he
would
try
to
love
me
,
---
<EOS>
not
that
he
did
,
---
<EOS>
and
then
I
saw
him
running
back
towards
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
I
saw
was
my
own
sword
naked
in
my
hand
,
and
he
lying
at
my
feet
stark
dead
,
---
dabbled
here
and
there
with
blood
,
but
otherwise
no
different
from
what
I
had
seen
him
in
his
sleep
---
in
the
same
attitude
too
,
with
his
cheek
resting
upon
his
little
hand
.
   
<EOS>
I
took
him
in
my
arms
and
laid
him
---
very
gently
now
that
he
was
dead
---
in
a
thicket
.
 
<EOS>
My
wife
was
from
home
that
day
,
and
would
not
return
until
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
Our
bedroom
window
,
the
only
sleeping
-
room
on
that
side
of
the
house
,
was
but
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
,
and
I
resolved
to
descend
from
it
at
night
and
bury
him
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
thought
that
I
had
failed
in
my
design
,
<EOS>
no
thought
that
the
water
would
be
dragged
and
nothing
found
,
that
the
money
must
now
lie
waste
,
since
I
must
encourage
the
idea
that
the
child
was
lost
or
stolen
.
 
<EOS>
All
my
thoughts
were
bound
up
and
knotted
together
in
the
one
absorbing
necessity
of
hiding
what
I
had
done
.
   
<EOS>
How
I
felt
when
they
came
to
tell
me
that
the
child
was
missing
,
when
I
ordered
scouts
in
all
directions
,
when
I
gasped
and
trembled
at
every
one
's
approach
,
no
tongue
can
tell
or
mind
of
man
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
I
buried
him
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
parted
the
boughs
and
looked
into
the
dark
thicket
,
there
was
a
glow
-
worm
shining
like
the
visible
spirit
of
God
upon
the
murdered
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
glanced
down
into
his
grave
when
I
had
placed
him
there
,
and
still
it
gleamed
upon
his
breast
;
an
eye
of
fire
looking
up
to
Heaven
in
supplication
to
the
stars
that
watched
me
at
my
work
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
to
meet
my
wife
,
and
break
the
news
,
and
give
her
hope
that
the
child
would
soon
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
I
did
,
---
with
some
appearance
,
I
suppose
,
of
being
sincere
,
for
I
was
the
object
of
no
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
I
sat
at
the
bedroom
window
all
day
long
,
and
watched
the
spot
where
the
dreadful
secret
lay
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
a
piece
of
ground
which
had
been
dug
up
to
be
newly
turfed
,
and
which
I
had
chosen
on
that
account
,
as
the
traces
of
my
spade
were
less
likely
to
attract
attention
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
who
laid
down
the
grass
must
have
thought
me
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
to
them
continually
to
expedite
their
work
,
ran
out
and
worked
beside
them
,
trod
down
the
earth
with
my
feet
,
and
hurried
them
with
frantic
eagerness
.
<EOS>
They
had
finished
their
task
before
night
,
and
then
I
thought
myself
comparatively
safe
.
   
<EOS>
I
slept
,
---
not
as
men
do
who
awake
refreshed
and
cheerful
,
but
I
did
sleep
,
passing
from
vague
and
shadowy
dreams
of
being
hunted
down
,
to
visions
of
the
plot
of
grass
,
through
which
now
a
hand
,
and
now
a
foot
,
and
now
the
head
itself
was
starting
out
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
point
I
always
woke
and
stole
to
the
window
,
to
make
sure
that
it
was
not
really
so
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
I
crept
to
bed
again
;
and
thus
I
spent
the
night
in
fits
and
starts
,
getting
up
and
lying
down
full
twenty
times
,
and
dreaming
the
same
dream
over
and
over
again
,
---
which
was
far
worse
than
lying
awake
,
<EOS>
for
every
dream
had
a
whole
night
's
suffering
of
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
Once
I
thought
the
child
was
alive
,
and
that
I
had
never
tried
to
kill
him
.
 
<EOS>
To
wake
from
that
dream
was
the
most
dreadful
agony
of
all
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
day
I
sat
at
the
window
again
,
never
once
taking
my
eyes
from
the
place
,
which
,
although
it
was
covered
by
the
grass
,
was
as
plain
to
me
---
its
shape
,
its
size
,
its
depth
,
its
jagged
sides
,
and
all
---
as
if
it
had
been
open
to
the
light
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
servant
walked
across
it
,
I
felt
as
if
he
must
sink
in
;
when
he
had
passed
,
I
looked
to
see
that
his
feet
had
not
worn
the
edges
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
bird
lighted
there
,
I
was
in
terror
lest
by
some
tremendous
interposition
it
should
be
instrumental
in
the
discovery
;
if
a
breath
of
air
sighed
across
it
,
to
me
it
whispered
murder
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
sight
or
a
sound
---
<EOS>
how
ordinary
,
mean
,
or
unimportant
soever
---
but
was
fraught
with
fear
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
this
state
of
ceaseless
watching
I
spent
three
days
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
there
came
to
the
gate
one
who
had
served
with
me
abroad
,
accompanied
by
a
brother
officer
of
his
whom
I
had
never
seen
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
that
I
could
not
bear
to
be
out
of
sight
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
summer
evening
,
and
I
bade
my
people
take
a
table
and
a
flask
of
wine
into
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
sat
down
WITH
MY
CHAIR
UPON
THE
GRAVE
,
and
being
assured
that
nobody
could
disturb
it
now
without
my
knowledge
,
tried
to
drink
and
talk
.
   
<EOS>
They
hoped
that
my
wife
was
well
,
---
that
she
was
not
obliged
to
keep
her
chamber
,
---
that
they
had
not
frightened
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
but
tell
them
with
a
faltering
tongue
about
the
child
?
<EOS>
The
officer
whom
I
did
not
know
was
a
down
-
looking
man
,
and
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
while
I
was
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
Even
that
terrified
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
divest
myself
of
the
idea
that
he
saw
something
there
which
caused
him
to
suspect
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
hurriedly
if
he
supposed
that
---
and
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
the
child
has
been
murdered
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
looking
mildly
at
me
:
 
"
<EOS>
O
no
!
<EOS>
what
could
a
man
gain
by
murdering
a
poor
child
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
told
him
what
a
man
gained
by
such
a
deed
,
no
one
better
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
held
my
peace
and
shivered
as
with
an
ague
.
   
<EOS>
Mistaking
my
emotion
,
they
were
endeavouring
to
cheer
me
with
the
hope
that
the
boy
would
certainly
be
found
,
---
great
cheer
that
was
for
me
!
<EOS>
---
when
we
heard
a
low
deep
howl
,
and
presently
there
sprung
over
the
wall
two
great
dogs
,
who
,
bounding
into
the
garden
,
repeated
the
baying
sound
we
had
heard
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bloodhounds
!
"
cried
my
visitors
.
   
<EOS>
What
need
to
tell
me
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
seen
one
of
that
kind
in
all
my
life
,
but
I
knew
what
they
were
and
for
what
purpose
they
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
grasped
the
elbows
of
my
chair
,
and
neither
spoke
nor
moved
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
of
the
genuine
breed
,
"
said
the
man
whom
I
had
known
abroad
,
"
and
being
out
for
exercise
have
no
doubt
escaped
from
their
keeper
.
"
   
<EOS>
Both
he
and
his
friend
turned
to
look
at
the
dogs
,
who
with
their
noses
to
the
ground
moved
restlessly
about
,
running
to
and
fro
,
and
up
and
down
,
and
across
,
and
round
in
circles
,
careering
about
like
wild
things
,
and
all
this
time
taking
no
notice
of
us
,
but
ever
and
again
repeating
the
yell
we
had
heard
already
,
then
dropping
their
noses
to
the
ground
again
and
tracking
earnestly
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
They
now
began
to
snuff
the
earth
more
eagerly
than
they
had
done
yet
,
and
although
they
were
still
very
restless
,
no
longer
beat
about
in
such
wide
circuits
,
but
kept
near
to
one
spot
,
and
constantly
diminished
the
distance
between
themselves
and
me
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
they
came
up
close
to
the
great
chair
on
which
I
sat
,
and
raising
their
frightful
howl
once
more
,
tried
to
tear
away
the
wooden
rails
that
kept
them
from
the
ground
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
how
I
looked
,
in
the
faces
of
the
two
who
were
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
scent
some
prey
,
"
said
they
,
both
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
scent
no
prey
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I.
   
<EOS>
"
In
Heaven
's
name
,
move
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
one
I
knew
,
very
earnestly
,
"
or
you
will
be
torn
to
pieces
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
them
tear
me
from
limb
to
limb
,
I
'll
never
leave
this
place
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I.
 
"
<EOS>
Are
dogs
to
hurry
men
to
shameful
deaths
?
 
<EOS>
Hew
them
down
,
cut
them
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
foul
mystery
here
!
"
said
the
officer
whom
I
did
not
know
,
drawing
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
King
Charles
's
name
,
assist
me
to
secure
this
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
both
set
upon
me
and
forced
me
away
,
though
I
fought
and
bit
and
caught
at
them
like
a
madman
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
struggle
,
they
got
me
quietly
between
them
;
and
then
,
my
God
!
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
angry
dogs
tearing
at
the
earth
and
throwing
it
up
into
the
air
like
water
.
   
<EOS>
What
more
have
I
to
tell
?
 
<EOS>
That
I
fell
upon
my
knees
,
and
with
chattering
teeth
confessed
the
truth
,
and
prayed
to
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
That
I
have
since
denied
,
and
now
confess
to
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
have
been
tried
for
the
crime
,
found
guilty
,
and
sentenced
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
have
not
the
courage
to
anticipate
my
doom
,
or
to
bear
up
manfully
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
have
no
compassion
,
no
consolation
,
no
hope
,
no
friend
.
 
<EOS>
That
my
wife
has
happily
lost
for
the
time
those
faculties
which
would
enable
her
to
know
my
misery
or
hers
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
am
alone
in
this
stone
dungeon
with
my
evil
spirit
,
and
that
I
die
to-
morrow
.

Correspondence
 
<EOS>
Master

blue

interchanging

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Bath
,
Wednesday
night
.
   
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
into
what
an
indiscretion
do
I
suffer
myself
to
be
betrayed
!
 
<EOS>
To
address
these
faltering
lines
to
a
total
stranger
,
and
that
stranger
one
of
a
conflicting

<EOS>
and
yet
I
am
precipitated
into
the
abyss
,
and
have
no
power
of
self
-
snatchation
(
forgive
me
if
I
coin
that
phrase
)
from
the
yawning
gulf
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
am
writing
to
a
man
;
but
let
me
not
think
of
that
,
for
madness
is
in
the
thought
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
understand
my
feelings
?
 
<EOS>
O
yes
,
I
am
sure
you
will
;
and
you
will
respect
them
too
,
and
not
despise
them
,
---
will
you
?
   
<EOS>
Let
me
be
calm
.
 
<EOS>
That
portrait
,
---
smiling
as
once
he
smiled
on
me
;
that
cane
,
---
dangling
as
I
have
seen
it
dangle
from
his
hand
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
oft
;
those
legs
that
have
glided
through
my
nightly
dreams
and
never
stopped
to
speak
;
the
perfectly
gentlemanly
,
though
false
original
,
---
can
I
be
mistaken
?
 
<EOS>
O
no
,
no
.
   
<EOS>
Let
me
be
calmer
yet
;
I
would
be
calm
as
coffins
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
published
a
letter
from
one
whose
likeness
is
engraved
,
but
whose
name
(
and
wherefore
?
)
is
suppressed
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
breathe
that
name
!
<EOS>
Is
it
---
but
why
ask
when
my
heart
tells
me
too
truly
that
it
is
!
   
<EOS>
I
would
not
upbraid
him
with
his
treachery
;
I
would
not
remind
him
of
those
times
when
he
plighted
the
most
eloquent
of
vows
,
and
procured
from
me
a
small
pecuniary
accommodation
;
and
yet
I
would
see
him
<EOS>
---
see
him
did
I
say
---
<EOS>
HIM
---
alas
!
<EOS>
such
is
woman
's
nature
.
<EOS>
For
as
the
poet
beautifully
says
---
but
you
will
already
have
anticipated
the
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
sweet
?
 
<EOS>
O
yes
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
city
(
<EOS>
hallowed
by
the
recollection
)
<EOS>
that
I
met
him
first
;
and
assuredly
if
mortal
happiness
be
recorded
anywhere
,
then
those
rubbers
with
their
three
-
and
-
sixpenny
points
are
scored
on
tablets
of
celestial
brass
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
held
an
honour
---
generally
two
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
eventful
night
we
stood
at
eight
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
his
eyes
<EOS>
(
luminous
in
their
seductive
sweetness
)
to
my
agitated
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
CAN
you
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
with
peculiar
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
the
gentle
pressure
of
his
foot
on
mine
;
our
corns
throbbed
in
unison
.
 
<EOS>
"
CAN
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
again
;
and
every
lineament
of
his
expressive
countenance
added
the
words
"
resist
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
murmured
"
No
,
"
and
fainted
.
   
<EOS>
They
said
,
when
I
recovered
,
it
was
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
it
was
the
nutmeg
in
the
negus
.
 
<EOS>
How
little
did
they
suspect
the
truth
!
 
<EOS>
How
little
did
they
guess
the
deep
mysterious
meaning
of
that
inquiry
!
<EOS>
He
called
next
morning
on
his
knees
;
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
actually
came
in
that
position
to
the
house
-
door
,
but
that
he
went
down
upon
those
joints
directly
the
servant
had
retired
.
 
<EOS>
He
brought
some
verses
in
his
hat
,
which
he
said
were
original
,
but
which
I
have
since
found
were
Milton
's
;
likewise
a
little
bottle
labelled
laudanum
;
also
a
pistol
and
a
sword
-
stick
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
the
latter
,
uncorked
the
former
,
and
clicked
the
trigger
of
the
pocket
fire
-
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
,
he
said
,
to
conquer
or
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrested
from
me
an
avowal
of
my
love
,
and
let
off
the
pistol
out
of
a
back
window
previous
to
partaking
of
a
slight
repast
.
   
<EOS>
Faithless
,
inconstant
man
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
ages
seem
to
have
elapsed
since
his
unaccountable
and
perfidious
disappearance
!
 
<EOS>
Could
I
still
forgive
him
both
that
and
the
borrowed
lucre
that
he
promised
to
pay
next
week
!
 
<EOS>
Could
I
spurn
him
from
my
feet
if
he
approached
in
penitence
,
and
with
a
matrimonial
object
!
 
<EOS>
Would
the
blandishing
enchanter
still
weave
his
spells
around
me
,
or
should
I
burst
them
all
and
turn
away
in
coldness
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
trust
my
weakness
with
the
thought
.
   
<EOS>
My
brain
is
in
a
whirl
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
his
address
,
his
occupations
,
his
mode
of
life
,
---
are
acquainted
,
perhaps
,
with
his
inmost
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
humane
and
philanthropic
character
;
reveal
all
you
know
---
all
;
but
especially
the
street
and
number
of
his
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
The
post
is
departing
,
the
bellman
rings
,
---
pray
Heaven
<EOS>
it
be
not
the
knell
of
love
and

to
   
BELINDA

The

I
open
this

say
that
the

is
gone

and
that
you
must
not

not

publishes

<EOS>
Master
Humphrey
's
Visitor
 
<EOS>
WHEN
I
am
in
a
thoughtful
mood
,
I
often
succeed
in
diverting
the
current
of
some
mournful
reflections
,
by
conjuring
up
a
number
of
fanciful
associations
with
the
objects
that
surround
me
,
and
dwelling
upon
the
scenes
and
characters
they
suggest
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
been
led
by
this
habit
to
assign
to
every
room
in
my
house
and
every
old
staring
portrait
on
its
walls
a
separate
interest
of
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
I
am
persuaded
that
a
stately
dame
,
terrible
to
behold
in
her
rigid
modesty
,
who
hangs
above
the
chimney
-
piece
of
my
bedroom
,
is
the
former
lady
of
the
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
courtyard
below
is
a
stone
face
of
surpassing
ugliness
,
which
I
have
somehow
---
in
a
kind
of
jealousy
<EOS>
,
I
am
afraid
---
associated
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Above
my
study
is
a
little
room
with
ivy
peeping
through
the
lattice
,
from
which
I
bring
their
daughter
,
a
lovely
girl
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
of
age
,
and
dutiful
in
all
respects
save
one
,
that
one
being
her
devoted
attachment
to
a
young
gentleman
on
the
stairs
,
whose
grandmother
(
degraded
to
a
disused
laundry
in
the
garden
)
<EOS>
piques
herself
upon
an
old
family
quarrel
,
and
is
the
implacable
enemy
of
their
love
.
 
<EOS>
With
such
materials
as
these
I
work
out
many
a
little
drama
,
whose
chief
merit
is
,
that
I
can
bring
it
to
a
happy
end
at
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
so
many
of
them
on
hand
,
that
if
on
my
return
home
one
of
these
evenings
I
were
to
find
some
bluff
old
wight
of
two
centuries
ago
comfortably
seated
in
my
easy
chair
,
and
a
lovelorn
damsel
vainly
appealing
to
his
heart
,
and
leaning
her
white
arm
upon
my
clock
itself
,
I
verily
believe
I
should
only
express
my
surprise
that
they
had
kept
me
waiting
so
long
,
and
never
honoured
me
with
a
call
before
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
in
such
a
mood
as
this
,
sitting
in
my
garden
yesterday
morning
under
the
shade
of
a
favourite
tree
,
revelling
in
all
the
bloom
and
brightness
about
me
,
and
feeling
every
sense
of
hope
and
enjoyment
quickened
by
this
most
beautiful
season
of
Spring
,
when
my
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
my
barber
at
the
end
of
the
walk
,
who
I
immediately
saw
was
coming
towards
me
with
a
hasty
step
that
betokened
something
remarkable
.
   
<EOS>
My
barber
is
at
all
times
a
very
brisk
,
bustling
,
active
little
man
,
---
for
he
is
,
as
it
were
,
chubby
all
over
,
without
being
stout
or
unwieldy
,
---
but
yesterday
his
alacrity
was
so
very
uncommon
that
it
quite
took
me
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
For
could
I
fail
to
observe
when
he
came
up
to
me
that
his
gray
eyes
were
twinkling
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
,
that
his
little
red
nose
was
in
an
unusual
glow
,
that
every
line
in
his
round
bright
face
was
twisted
and
curved
into
an
expression
of
pleased
surprise
,
and
that
his
whole
countenance
was
radiant
with
glee
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
still
more
surprised
to
see
my
housekeeper
,
who
usually
preserves
a
very
staid
air
,
and
stands
somewhat
upon
her
dignity
,
peeping
round
the
hedge
at
the
bottom
of
the
walk
,
and
exchanging
nods
and
smiles
with
the
barber
,
who
twice
or
thrice
looked
over
his
shoulder
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
conceive
no
announcement
to
which
these
appearances
could
be
the
prelude
,
unless
it
were
that
they
had
married
each
other
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
,
consequently
,
a
little
disappointed
when
it
only
came
out
that
there
was
a
gentleman
in
the
house
who
wished
to
speak
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
who
is
it
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
The
barber
,
with
his
face
screwed
up
still
tighter
than
before
,
replied
that
the
gentleman
would
not
send
his
name
,
but
wished
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
pondered
for
a
moment
,
wondering
who
this
visitor
might
be
,
and
I
remarked
that
he
embraced
the
opportunity
of
exchanging
another
nod
with
the
housekeeper
,
who
still
lingered
in
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
I
,
"
bid
the
gentleman
come
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
seemed
to
be
the
consummation
of
the
barber
's
hopes
,
for
he
turned
sharp
round
,
and
actually
ran
away
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
my
sight
is
not
very
good
at
a
distance
,
and
therefore
when
the
gentleman
first
appeared
in
the
walk
,
I
was
not
quite
clear
whether
he
was
a
stranger
to
me
or
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
elderly
gentleman
,
but
came
tripping
along
in
the
pleasantest
manner
conceivable
,
avoiding
the
garden
-
roller
and
the
borders
of
the
beds
with
inimitable
dexterity
,
picking
his
way
among
the
flower
-
pots
,
and
smiling
with
unspeakable
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
Before
he
was
half
-
way
up
the
walk
he
began
to
salute
me
;
then
I
thought
I
knew
him
;
but
when
he
came
towards
me
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
the
sun
shining
on
his
bald
head
,
his
bland
face
,
his
bright
spectacles
,
his
fawn-
coloured
tights
,
and
his
black
gaiters
,
---
then
my
heart
warmed
towards
him
,
and
I
felt
quite
certain
that
it
was
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
"
said
that
gentleman
as
I
rose
to
receive
him
,
"
pray
be
seated
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
do
not
stand
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
insist
upon
it
,
really
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
Mr
Pickwick
gently
pressed
me
down
into
my
seat
,
and
taking
my
hand
in
his
,
shook
it
again
and
again
with
a
warmth
of
manner
perfectly
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
express
in
my
welcome
something
of
that
heartiness
and
pleasure
which
the
sight
of
him
awakened
,
and
made
him
sit
down
beside
me
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
he
kept
alternately
releasing
my
hand
and
grasping
it
again
,
and
surveying
me
through
his
spectacles
with
such
a
beaming
countenance
as
I
never
till
then
beheld
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
knew
me
directly
!
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
pleasure
<EOS>
it
is
to
think
that
you
knew
me
directly
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
remarked
that
I
had
read
his
adventures
very
often
,
and
his
features
were
quite
familiar
to
me
from
the
published
portraits
.
<EOS>
As
I
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
of
adverting
to
the
circumstance
,
I
condoled
with
him
upon
the
various
libels
on
his
character
which
had
found
their
way
into
print
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
shook
his
head
,
and
for
a
moment
looked
very
indignant
,
but
smiling
again
directly
,
added
that
no
doubt
I
was
acquainted
with
Cervantes
's
introduction
to
the
second
part
of
Don
Quixote
,
and
that
it
fully
expressed
his
sentiments
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
do
n't
you
wonder
how
I
found
you
out
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
wonder
,
and
,
with
your
good
leave
,
never
know
,
"
said
I
,
smiling
in
my
turn
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
for
me
that
you
give
me
this
gratification
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
desire
that
you
should
tell
me
by
what
means
I
have
obtained
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
"
returned
Mr
Pickwick
,
shaking
me
by
the
hand
again
;
"
you
are
so
exactly
what
I
expected
!
 
<EOS>
But
for
what
particular
purpose
do
you
think
I
have
sought
you
,
my
dear
sir
?
<EOS>
Now
what
DO
you
think
I
have
come
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
put
this
question
as
though
he
were
persuaded
that
it
was
morally
impossible
that
I
could
by
any
means
divine
the
deep
purpose
of
his
visit
,
and
that
it
must
be
hidden
from
all
human
ken
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
although
I
was
rejoiced
to
think
that
I
had
anticipated
his
drift
,
I
feigned
to
be
quite
ignorant
of
it
,
and
after
a
brief
consideration
shook
my
head
despairingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
say
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
laying
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
upon
my
coat
-
sleeve
,
and
looking
at
me
with
his
head
thrown
back
,
and
a
little
on
one
side
,
---
"
what
should
you
say
<EOS>
if
I
confessed
that
after
reading
your
account
of
yourself
and
your
little
society
,
I
had
come
here
,
a
humble
candidate
for
one
of
those
empty
chairs
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
"
I
returned
,
"
that
I
know
of
only
one
circumstance
which
could
still
further
endear
that
little
society
to
me
,
and
that
would
be
the
associating
with
it
<EOS>
my
old
friend
,
---
for
you
must
let
me
call
you
so
,
---
my
old
friend
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
I
made
him
this
answer
every
feature
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
face
fused
itself
into
one
all
-
pervading
expression
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
After
shaking
me
heartily
by
both
hands
at
once
,
he
patted
me
gently
on
the
back
,
and
then
---
I
well
understood
why
<EOS>
---
coloured
up
to
the
eyes
,
and
hoped
with
great
earnestness
of
manner
that
he
had
not
hurt
me
.
   
<EOS>
If
he
had
,
I
would
have
been
content
that
he
should
have
repeated
the
offence
a
hundred
times
rather
than
suppose
so
;
but
as
he
had
not
,
I
had
no
difficulty
in
changing
the
subject
by
making
an
inquiry
which
had
been
upon
my
lips
twenty
times
already
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
told
me
,
"
said
I
,
"
anything
about
Sam
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
!
<EOS>
Sam
,
"
replied
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
is
the
same
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
true
,
faithful
fellow
that
he
ever
was
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
I
tell
you
about
Sam
,
my
dear
sir
,
except
that
he
is
more
indispensable
to
my
happiness
and
comfort
every
day
of
my
life
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
Mr
Weller
senior
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Mr
Weller
,
"
returned
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
is
in
no
respect
more
altered
than
Sam
,
unless
it
be
that
he
is
a
little
more
opinionated
than
he
was
formerly
,
and
perhaps
at
times
more
talkative
.
 
<EOS>
He
spends
a
good
deal
of
his
time
now
in
our
neighbourhood
,
and
has
so
constituted
himself
a
part
of
my
bodyguard
,
that
when
I
ask
permission
for
Sam
to
have
a
seat
in
your
kitchen
on
clock
nights
(
supposing
your
three
friends
think
me
worthy
to
fill
one
of
the
chairs
)
,
I
am
afraid
I
must
often
include
Mr
Weller
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
very
readily
pledged
myself
to
give
both
Sam
and
his
father
a
free
admission
to
my
house
at
all
hours
and
seasons
,
and
this
point
settled
,
we
fell
into
a
lengthy
conversation
which
was
carried
on
with
as
little
reserve
on
both
sides
as
if
we
had
been
intimate
friends
from
our
youth
,
and
which
conveyed
to
me
the
comfortable
assurance
that
Mr
Pickwick
's
buoyancy
of
spirit
,
and
indeed
all
his
old
cheerful
characteristics
,
were
wholly
unimpaired
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
spoken
of
the
consent
of
my
friends
as
being
yet
in
abeyance
,
I
repeatedly
assured
him
that
his
proposal
was
certain
to
receive
their
most
joyful
sanction
,
and
several
times
entreated
that
he
would
give
me
leave
to
introduce
him
to
Jack
Redburn
and
Mr
Miles
(
who
were
near
at
hand
)
without
further
ceremony
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
proposal
,
however
,
Mr
Pickwick
's
delicacy
would
by
no
means
allow
him
to
accede
,
for
he
urged
that
his
eligibility
must
be
formally
discussed
,
and
that
,
until
this
had
been
done
,
he
could
not
think
of
obtruding
himself
further
.
 
<EOS>
The
utmost
I
could
obtain
from
him
was
a
promise
that
he
would
attend
upon
our
next
night
of
meeting
,
that
I
might
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
him
immediately
on
his
election
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
having
with
many
blushes
placed
in
my
hands
a
small
roll
of
paper
,
which
he
termed
his
"
qualification
,
"
put
a
great
many
questions
to
me
touching
my
friends
,
and
particularly
Jack
Redburn
,
whom
he
repeatedly
termed
"
a
fine
fellow
,
"
and
in
whose
favour
I
could
see
he
was
strongly
predisposed
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
satisfied
him
on
these
points
,
I
took
him
up
into
my
room
,
that
he
might
make
acquaintance
with
the
old
chamber
which
is
our
place
of
meeting
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
this
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
stopping
short
,
"
is
the
clock
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
this
is
really
the
old
clock
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
he
would
never
have
come
away
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
advancing
towards
it
softly
,
and
laying
his
hand
upon
it
with
as
much
respect
and
as
many
smiling
looks
as
if
it
were
alive
,
he
set
himself
to
consider
it
in
every
possible
direction
,
now
mounting
on
a
chair
to
look
at
the
top
,
now
going
down
upon
his
knees
to
examine
the
bottom
,
now
surveying
the
sides
with
his
spectacles
almost
touching
the
case
,
and
now
trying
to
peep
between
it
and
the
wall
to
get
a
slight
view
of
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
would
retire
a
pace
or
two
and
look
up
at
the
dial
to
see
it
go
,
and
then
draw
near
again
and
stand
with
his
head
on
one
side
to
hear
it
tick
:
 
never
failing
to
glance
towards
me
at
intervals
of
a
few
seconds
each
,
and
nod
his
head
with
such
complacent
gratification
as
I
am
quite
unable
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
His
admiration
was
not
confined
to
the
clock
either
,
but
extended
itself
to
every
article
in
the
room
;
and
really
,
when
he
had
gone
through
them
every
one
,
and
at
last
sat
himself
down
in
all
the
six
chairs
,
one
after
another
,
to
try
how
they
felt
,
I
never
saw
such
a
picture
of
good
-
humour
and
happiness
as
he
presented
,
from
the
top
of
his
shining
head
down
to
the
very
last
button
of
his
gaiters
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
well
pleased
,
and
should
have
had
the
utmost
enjoyment
of
his
company
,
if
he
had
remained
with
me
all
day
,
but
my
favourite
,
striking
the
hour
,
reminded
him
that
he
must
take
his
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forbear
telling
him
once
more
how
glad
he
had
made
me
,
and
we
shook
hands
all
the
way
down
-
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
no
sooner
arrived
in
the
Hall
than
my
housekeeper
,
gliding
out
of
her
little
room
<EOS>
(
she
had
changed
her
gown
and
cap
,
I
observed
)
,
greeted
Mr
Pickwick
with
her
best
smile
and
courtesy
;
and
the
barber
,
feigning
to
be
accidentally
passing
on
his
way
out
,
made
him
a
vast
number
of
bows
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
housekeeper
courtesied
,
Mr
Pickwick
bowed
with
the
utmost
politeness
,
and
when
he
bowed
,
the
housekeeper
courtesied
again
;
between
the
housekeeper
and
the
barber
,
I
should
say
that
Mr
Pickwick
faced
about
and
bowed
with
undiminished
affability
fifty
times
at
least
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
him
to
the
door
;
an
omnibus
was
at
the
moment
passing
the
corner
of
the
lane
,
which
Mr
Pickwick
hailed
and
ran
after
with
extraordinary
nimbleness
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
got
about
half
-
way
,
he
turned
his
head
,
and
seeing
that
I
was
still
looking
after
him
and
that
I
waved
my
hand
,
stopped
,
evidently
irresolute
whether
to
come
back
and
shake
hands
again
,
or
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
behind
the
omnibus
shouted
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
ran
a
little
way
towards
him
:
then
he
looked
round
at
me
,
and
ran
a
little
way
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
was
another
shout
,
and
he
turned
round
once
more
and
ran
the
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
After
several
of
these
vibrations
,
the
man
settled
the
question
by
taking
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
arm
and
putting
him
into
the
carriage
;
but
his
last
action
was
to
let
down
the
window
and
wave
his
hat
to
me
as
it
drove
off
.
   
<EOS>
I
lost
no
time
in
opening
the
parcel
he
had
left
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
following
were
its
contents
:

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
Tale
 
<EOS>
A
good
many
years
have
passed
away
since
old
John
Podgers
lived
in
the
town
of
Windsor
,
where
he
was
born
,
and
where
,
in
course
of
time
,
he
came
to
be
comfortably
and
snugly
buried
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
that
in
the
time
of
King
James
the
First
,
Windsor
was
a
very
quaint
queer
old
town
,
and
you
may
take
it
upon
my
authority
that
John
Podgers
was
a
very
quaint
queer
old
fellow
;
consequently
he
and
Windsor
fitted
each
other
to
a
nicety
,
and
seldom
parted
company
even
for
half
a
day
.
   
<EOS>
John
Podgers
was
broad
,
sturdy
,
Dutch
-
built
,
short
,
and
a
very
hard
eater
,
as
men
of
his
figure
often
are
.
 
<EOS>
Being
a
hard
sleeper
likewise
,
he
divided
his
time
pretty
equally
between
these
two
recreations
,
always
falling
asleep
when
he
had
done
eating
,
and
always
taking
another
turn
at
the
trencher
when
he
had
done
sleeping
,
by
which
means
he
grew
more
corpulent
and
more
drowsy
every
day
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
it
used
to
be
currently
reported
that
when
he
sauntered
up
and
down
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
before
dinner
(
as
he
never
failed
to
do
in
fair
weather
)
,
he
enjoyed
his
soundest
nap
;
but
many
people
held
this
to
be
a
fiction
,
as
he
had
several
times
been
seen
to
look
after
fat
oxen
on
market
-
days
,
and
had
even
been
heard
,
by
persons
of
good
credit
and
reputation
,
to
chuckle
at
the
sight
,
and
say
to
himself
with
great
glee
,
"
Live
beef
,
live
beef
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
upon
this
evidence
that
the
wisest
people
in
Windsor
(
beginning
with
the
local
authorities
of
course
)
held
that
John
Podgers
was
a
man
of
strong
,
sound
sense
,
not
what
is
called
smart
,
perhaps
,
and
it
might
be
of
a
rather
lazy
and
apoplectic
turn
,
but
still
a
man
of
solid
parts
,
and
one
who
meant
much
more
than
he
cared
to
show
.
 
<EOS>
This
impression
was
confirmed
by
a
very
dignified
way
he
had
of
shaking
his
head
and
imparting
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
pendulous
motion
to
his
double
chin
;
in
short
,
he
passed
for
one
of
those
people
who
,
being
plunged
into
the
Thames
,
would
make
no
vain
efforts
to
set
it
afire
,
but
would
straightway
flop
down
to
the
bottom
with
a
deal
of
gravity
,
and
be
highly
respected
in
consequence
by
all
good
men
.
   
<EOS>
Being
well
to
do
in
the
world
,
and
a
peaceful
widower
,
---
having
a
great
appetite
,
which
,
as
he
could
afford
to
gratify
it
,
was
a
luxury
and
no
inconvenience
,
and
a
power
of
going
to
sleep
,
which
,
as
he
had
no
occasion
to
keep
awake
,
was
a
most
enviable
faculty
,
<EOS>
---
you
will
readily
suppose
that
John
Podgers
was
a
happy
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
appearances
are
often
deceptive
when
they
least
seem
so
,
and
the
truth
is
that
,
notwithstanding
his
extreme
sleekness
,
he
was
rendered
uneasy
in
his
mind
and
exceedingly
uncomfortable
by
a
constant
apprehension
that
beset
him
night
and
day
.
   
<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
in
those
times
there
flourished
divers
evil
old
women
who
,
under
the
name
of
Witches
,
spread
great
disorder
through
the
land
,
and
inflicted
various
dismal
tortures
upon
Christian
men
;
sticking
pins
and
needles
into
them
when
they
least
expected
it
,
and
causing
them
to
walk
in
the
air
with
their
feet
upwards
,
to
the
great
terror
of
their
wives
and
families
,
who
were
naturally
very
much
disconcerted
when
the
master
of
the
house
unexpectedly
came
home
,
knocking
at
the
door
with
his
heels
and
combing
his
hair
on
the
scraper
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
their
commonest
pranks
,
but
they
every
day
played
a
hundred
others
,
of
which
none
were
less
objectionable
,
and
many
were
much
more
so
,
being
improper
besides
;
the
result
was
that
vengeance
was
denounced
against
all
old
women
,
with
whom
even
the
king
himself
had
no
sympathy
(
as
he
certainly
ought
to
have
had
)
,
for
with
his
own
most
Gracious
hand
he
penned
a
most
Gracious
consignment
of
them
to
everlasting
wrath
,
and
devised
most
Gracious
means
for
their
confusion
and
slaughter
,
in
virtue
whereof
scarcely
a
day
passed
but
one
witch
at
the
least
was
most
graciously
hanged
,
drowned
,
or
roasted
in
some
part
of
his
dominions
.
 
<EOS>
Still
the
press
teemed
with
strange
and
terrible
news
from
the
North
or
the
South
,
or
the
East
or
the
West
,
relative
to
witches
and
their
unhappy
victims
in
some
corner
of
the
country
,
and
the
Public
's
hair
stood
on
end
to
that
degree
that
it
lifted
its
hat
off
its
head
,
and
made
its
face
pale
with
terror
.
   
<EOS>
You
may
believe
that
the
little
town
of
Windsor
did
not
escape
the
general
contagion
.
 
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
boiled
a
witch
on
the
king
's
birthday
and
sent
a
bottle
of
the
broth
to
court
,
with
a
dutiful
address
expressive
of
their
loyalty
.
 
<EOS>
The
king
,
being
rather
frightened
by
the
present
,
piously
bestowed
it
upon
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
and
returned
an
answer
to
the
address
,
wherein
he
gave
them
golden
rules
for
discovering
witches
,
and
laid
great
stress
upon
certain
protecting
charms
,
and
especially
horseshoes
.
<EOS>
Immediately
the
towns
-
people
went
to
work
nailing
up
horseshoes
over
every
door
,
and
so
many
anxious
parents
apprenticed
their
children
to
farriers
to
keep
them
out
of
harm
's
way
,
that
it
became
quite
a
genteel
trade
,
and
flourished
exceedingly
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
bustle
John
Podgers
ate
and
slept
as
usual
,
but
shook
his
head
a
great
deal
oftener
than
was
his
custom
,
and
was
observed
to
look
at
the
oxen
less
,
and
at
the
old
women
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
little
shelf
put
up
in
his
sitting
-
room
,
whereon
was
displayed
,
in
a
row
which
grew
longer
every
week
,
all
the
witchcraft
literature
of
the
time
;
he
grew
learned
in
charms
and
exorcisms
,
hinted
at
certain
questionable
females
on
broomsticks
whom
he
had
seen
from
his
chamber
window
,
riding
in
the
air
at
night
,
and
was
in
constant
terror
of
being
bewitched
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
from
perpetually
dwelling
upon
this
one
idea
,
which
,
being
alone
in
his
head
,
had
all
its
own
way
,
the
fear
of
witches
became
the
single
passion
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
who
up
to
that
time
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
dream
,
began
to
have
visions
of
witches
whenever
he
fell
asleep
;
waking
,
they
were
incessantly
present
to
his
imagination
likewise
;
and
,
sleeping
or
waking
,
he
had
not
a
moment
's
peace
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
set
witch
-
traps
in
the
highway
,
and
was
often
seen
lying
in
wait
round
the
corner
for
hours
together
,
to
watch
their
effect
.
 
<EOS>
These
engines
were
of
simple
construction
,
usually
consisting
of
two
straws
disposed
in
the
form
of
a
cross
,
or
a
piece
of
a
Bible
cover
with
a
pinch
of
salt
upon
it
;
but
they
were
infallible
,
and
if
an
old
woman
chanced
to
stumble
over
them
(
as
not
unfrequently
happened
,
the
chosen
spot
being
a
broken
and
stony
place
)
,
John
started
from
a
doze
,
pounced
out
upon
her
,
and
hung
round
her
neck
till
assistance
arrived
,
when
she
was
immediately
carried
away
and
drowned
.
 
<EOS>
By
dint
of
constantly
inveigling
old
ladies
and
disposing
of
them
in
this
summary
manner
,
he
acquired
the
reputation
of
a
great
public
character
;
and
as
he
received
no
harm
in
these
pursuits
beyond
a
scratched
face
or
so
,
he
came
,
in
the
course
of
time
,
to
be
considered
witch
-
proof
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
person
who
entertained
the
least
doubt
of
John
Podgers
's
gifts
,
and
that
person
was
his
own
nephew
,
a
wild
,
roving
young
fellow
of
twenty
who
had
been
brought
up
in
his
uncle
's
house
and
lived
there
still
,
---
that
is
to
say
,
when
he
was
at
home
,
which
was
not
as
often
as
it
might
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
an
apt
scholar
,
it
was
he
who
read
aloud
every
fresh
piece
of
strange
and
terrible
intelligence
that
John
Podgers
bought
;
and
this
he
always
did
of
an
evening
in
the
little
porch
in
front
of
the
house
,
round
which
the
neighbours
would
flock
in
crowds
to
hear
the
direful
news
,
---
for
people
like
to
be
frightened
,
and
when
they
can
be
frightened
for
nothing
and
at
another
man
's
expense
,
they
like
it
<EOS>
all
the
better
.
   
<EOS>
One
fine
midsummer
evening
,
a
group
of
persons
were
gathered
in
this
place
,
listening
intently
to
Will
Marks
(
that
was
the
nephew
's
name
)
,
as
with
his
cap
very
much
on
one
side
,
his
arm
coiled
slyly
round
the
waist
of
a
pretty
girl
who
sat
beside
him
,
and
his
face
screwed
into
a
comical
expression
intended
to
represent
extreme
gravity
,
he
read
---
with
Heaven
knows
how
many
embellishments
of
his
own
---
a
dismal
account
of
a
gentleman
down
in
Northamptonshire
under
the
influence
of
witchcraft
and
taken
forcible
possession
of
by
the
Devil
,
who
was
playing
his
very
self
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
John
Podgers
,
in
a
high
sugar
-
loaf
hat
and
short
cloak
,
filled
the
opposite
seat
,
and
surveyed
the
auditory
with
a
look
of
mingled
pride
and
horror
very
edifying
to
see
;
while
the
hearers
,
with
their
heads
thrust
forward
and
their
mouths
open
,
listened
and
trembled
,
and
hoped
there
was
a
great
deal
more
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
Will
stopped
for
an
instant
to
look
round
upon
his
eager
audience
,
and
then
,
with
a
more
comical
expression
of
face
than
before
and
a
settling
of
himself
comfortably
,
which
included
a
squeeze
of
the
young
lady
before
mentioned
,
he
launched
into
some
new
wonder
surpassing
all
the
others
.
   
<EOS>
The
setting
sun
shed
his
last
golden
rays
upon
this
little
party
,
who
,
absorbed
in
their
present
occupation
,
took
no
heed
of
the
approach
of
night
,
or
the
glory
in
which
the
day
went
down
,
when
the
sound
of
a
horse
,
approaching
at
a
good
round
trot
,
invading
the
silence
of
the
hour
,
caused
the
reader
to
make
a
sudden
stop
,
and
the
listeners
to
raise
their
heads
in
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
their
wonder
diminished
when
a
horseman
dashed
up
to
the
porch
,
and
abruptly
checking
his
steed
,
inquired
where
one
John
Podgers
dwelt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
!
"
cried
a
dozen
voices
,
while
a
dozen
hands
pointed
out
sturdy
John
,
still
basking
in
the
terrors
of
the
pamphlet
.
   
<EOS>
The
rider
,
giving
his
bridle
to
one
of
those
who
surrounded
him
,
dismounted
,
and
approached
John
,
hat
in
hand
,
but
with
great
haste
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whence
come
ye
?
"
said
John
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
Kingston
,
master
.
"
   
"
And
wherefore
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
most
pressing
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
what
nature
?
"
   
"
Witchcraft
.
"
   
Witchcraft
!
 
<EOS>
Everybody
looked
aghast
at
the
breathless
messenger
,
and
the
breathless
messenger
looked
equally
aghast
at
everybody
---
except
Will
Marks
,
who
,
finding
himself
unobserved
,
not
only
squeezed
the
young
lady
again
,
but
kissed
her
twice
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
he
must
have
been
bewitched
himself
,
or
he
never
could
have
done
it
---
and
the
young
lady
too
,
or
she
never
would
have
let
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Witchcraft
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Will
,
drowning
the
sound
of
his
last
kiss
,
which
was
rather
a
loud
one
.
   
<EOS>
The
messenger
turned
towards
him
,
and
with
a
frown
repeated
the
word
more
solemnly
than
before
;
then
told
his
errand
,
which
was
,
in
brief
,
that
the
people
of
Kingston
had
been
greatly
terrified
for
some
nights
past
by
hideous
revels
,
held
by
witches
beneath
the
gibbet
within
a
mile
of
the
town
,
and
related
and
deposed
to
by
chance
wayfarers
who
had
passed
within
ear
-
shot
of
the
spot
;
that
the
sound
of
their
voices
in
their
wild
orgies
had
been
plainly
heard
by
many
persons
;
that
three
old
women
laboured
under
strong
suspicion
,
and
that
precedents
had
been
consulted
and
solemn
council
had
,
and
it
was
found
that
to
identify
the
hags
<EOS>
some
single
person
must
watch
upon
the
spot
alone
;
that
no
single
person
had
the
courage
to
perform
the
task
;
and
that
he
had
been
despatched
express
to
solicit
John
Podgers
to
undertake
it
that
very
night
,
as
being
a
man
of
great
renown
,
who
bore
a
charmed
life
,
and
was
proof
against
unholy
spells
.
   
<EOS>
John
received
this
communication
with
much
composure
,
and
said
in
a
few
words
,
that
it
would
have
afforded
him
inexpressible
pleasure
to
do
the
Kingston
people
so
slight
<EOS>
a
service
,
if
it
were
not
for
his
unfortunate
propensity
to
fall
asleep
,
which
no
man
regretted
more
than
himself
upon
the
present
occasion
,
but
which
quite
settled
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
said
,
there
WAS
a
gentleman
present
<EOS>
(
and
here
he
looked
very
hard
at
a
tall
farrier
)
,
who
,
having
been
engaged
all
his
life
in
the
manufacture
of
horseshoes
,
must
be
quite
invulnerable
to
the
power
of
witches
,
and
who
,
he
had
no
doubt
,
from
his
own
reputation
for
bravery
and
good
-
nature
,
would
readily
accept
the
commission
.
 
<EOS>
The
farrier
politely
thanked
him
for
his
good
opinion
,
which
it
would
always
be
his
study
to
deserve
,
but
added
that
,
with
regard
to
the
present
little
matter
,
he
could
n't
think
of
it
on
any
account
,
as
his
departing
on
such
an
errand
would
certainly
occasion
the
instant
death
of
his
wife
,
to
whom
,
as
they
all
knew
,
he
was
tenderly
attached
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
so
far
from
this
circumstance
being
notorious
,
everybody
had
suspected
the
reverse
,
as
the
farrier
was
in
the
habit
of
beating
his
lady
rather
more
than
tender
husbands
usually
do
;
all
the
married
men
present
,
however
,
applauded
his
resolution
with
great
vehemence
,
and
one
and
all
declared
that
they
would
stop
at
home
and
die
if
needful
(
which
happily
it
was
not
)
in
defence
of
their
lawful
partners
.
   
<EOS>
This
burst
of
enthusiasm
over
<EOS>
,
they
began
to
look
,
as
by
one
consent
,
toward
Will
Marks
,
who
,
with
his
cap
more
on
one
side
than
ever
,
sat
watching
the
proceedings
with
extraordinary
unconcern
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
heard
openly
to
express
his
disbelief
in
witches
,
but
had
often
cut
such
jokes
at
their
expense
as
left
it
to
be
inferred
;
publicly
stating
on
several
occasions
that
he
considered
a
broomstick
an
inconvenient
charger
,
and
one
especially
unsuited
to
the
dignity
of
the
female
character
,
and
indulging
in
other
free
remarks
of
the
same
tendency
,
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
wild
companions
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
looked
at
Will
they
began
to
whisper
and
murmur
among
themselves
,
and
at
length
one
man
cried
,
"
Why
do
n't
you
ask
Will
Marks
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
this
was
what
everybody
had
been
thinking
of
,
they
all
took
up
the
word
,
and
cried
in
concert
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
why
do
n't
you
ask
Will
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
HE
do
n't
care
,
"
said
the
farrier
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
he
,
"
added
another
voice
in
the
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
believe
in
it
,
you
know
,
"
sneered
a
little
man
with
a
yellow
face
and
a
taunting
nose
and
chin
,
which
he
thrust
out
from
under
the
arm
of
a
long
man
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
said
a
red
-
faced
gentleman
with
a
gruff
voice
,
"
he
's
a
single
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
point
!
"
said
the
farrier
;
and
all
the
married
men
murmured
,
ah
!
<EOS>
that
was
it
,
and
they
only
wished
they
were
single
themselves
;
they
would
show
him
what
spirit
was
,
very
soon
.
   
<EOS>
The
messenger
looked
towards
Will
Marks
beseechingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
wet
night
,
friend
,
and
my
gray
nag
<EOS>
is
tired
after
yesterday
's
work
---
"
   
Here
there
was
a
general
titter
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
resumed
Will
,
looking
about
him
with
a
smile
,
"
if
nobody
else
puts
in
a
better
claim
to
go
,
for
the
credit
of
the
town
I
am
your
man
,
and
I
would
be
,
if
I
had
to
go
afoot
.
 
<EOS>
In
five
minutes
I
shall
be
in
the
saddle
,
unless
I
am
depriving
any
worthy
gentleman
here
of
the
honour
of
the
adventure
,
which
I
would
n't
do
for
the
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
here
arose
a
double
difficulty
,
for
not
only
<EOS>
did
John
Podgers
combat
the
resolution
with
all
the
words
he
had
,
which
were
not
many
,
but
the
young
lady
combated
it
too
with
all
the
tears
she
had
,
which
were
very
many
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Will
,
however
,
being
inflexible
,
parried
his
uncle
's
objections
with
a
joke
,
and
coaxed
the
young
lady
into
a
smile
in
three
short
whispers
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
plain
that
he
set
his
mind
upon
it
,
and
would
go
,
John
Podgers
offered
him
a
few
first
-
rate
charms
out
of
his
own
pocket
,
which
he
dutifully
declined
to
accept
;
and
the
young
lady
gave
him
a
kiss
,
which
he
also
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
what
a
rare
thing
it
is
to
be
married
,
"
said
Will
,
"
and
how
careful
and
considerate
all
these
husbands
are
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
not
a
man
among
them
but
his
heart
is
leaping
to
forestall
me
in
this
adventure
,
and
yet
a
strong
sense
of
duty
keeps
him
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
husbands
in
this
one
little
town
are
a
pattern
to
the
world
,
and
so
must
the
wives
be
too
,
for
that
matter
,
or
they
could
never
boast
half
the
influence
they
have
!
"
   
<EOS>
Waiting
for
no
reply
to
this
sarcasm
,
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
withdrew
into
the
house
,
and
thence
into
the
stable
,
while
some
busied
themselves
in
refreshing
the
messenger
,
and
others
in
baiting
his
steed
.
 
<EOS>
In
less
than
the
specified
time
he
returned
by
another
way
,
with
a
good
cloak
hanging
over
his
arm
,
a
good
sword
girded
by
his
side
,
and
leading
his
good
horse
caparisoned
for
the
journey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Will
,
leaping
into
the
saddle
at
a
bound
,
"
up
and
away
.
<EOS>
Upon
your
mettle
,
friend
,
and
push
on
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
kissed
his
hand
to
the
girl
,
nodded
to
his
drowsy
uncle
,
waved
his
cap
to
the
rest
---
and
off
they
flew
pell
-
mell
,
as
if
all
the
witches
in
England
were
in
their
horses
'
legs
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
.
   
<EOS>
The
men
who
were
left
behind
shook
their
heads
doubtfully
,
stroked
their
chins
,
and
shook
their
heads
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
farrier
said
that
certainly
Will
Marks
was
a
good
horseman
<EOS>
,
nobody
should
ever
say
he
denied
that
:
 
<EOS>
but
he
was
rash
,
very
rash
,
and
there
was
no
telling
what
the
end
of
it
might
be
;
what
did
he
go
for
,
that
was
what
he
wanted
to
know
?
 
<EOS>
He
wished
the
young
fellow
no
harm
,
but
why
did
he
go
?
 
<EOS>
Everybody
echoed
these
words
,
and
shook
their
heads
again
,
having
done
which
they
wished
John
Podgers
good
night
,
and
straggled
home
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
The
Kingston
people
were
in
their
first
sleep
when
Will
Marks
and
his
conductor
rode
through
the
town
and
up
to
the
door
of
a
house
where
sundry
grave
functionaries
were
assembled
,
anxiously
expecting
the
arrival
of
the
renowned
Podgers
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
a
little
disappointed
to
find
a
gay
young
man
in
his
place
;
but
they
put
the
best
face
upon
the
matter
,
and
gave
him
full
instructions
how
he
was
to
conceal
himself
behind
the
gibbet
,
and
watch
and
listen
to
the
witches
,
and
how
at
a
certain
time
he
was
to
burst
forth
and
cut
and
slash
among
them
vigorously
,
so
that
the
suspected
parties
might
be
found
bleeding
in
their
beds
next
day
,
and
thoroughly
confounded
.
 
<EOS>
They
gave
him
a
great
quantity
of
wholesome
advice
besides
,
and
---
which
was
more
to
the
purpose
with
Will
---
a
good
supper
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
things
being
done
,
and
midnight
nearly
come
,
they
sallied
forth
to
show
him
the
spot
where
he
was
to
keep
his
dreary
vigil
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
was
by
this
time
dark
and
threatening
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
rumbling
of
distant
thunder
,
and
a
low
sighing
of
wind
among
the
trees
,
which
was
very
dismal
.
 
<EOS>
The
potentates
of
the
town
kept
so
uncommonly
close
to
Will
that
they
trod
upon
his
toes
,
or
stumbled
against
his
ankles
,
or
nearly
tripped
up
his
heels
at
every
step
he
took
,
and
,
besides
these
annoyances
,
their
teeth
chattered
so
with
fear
,
that
he
seemed
to
be
accompanied
by
a
dirge
of
castanets
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
they
made
a
halt
at
the
opening
of
a
lonely
,
desolate
space
,
and
,
pointing
to
a
black
object
at
some
distance
<EOS>
,
asked
<EOS>
Will
if
he
saw
that
,
yonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
Informing
him
abruptly
that
it
was
the
gibbet
where
he
was
to
watch
<EOS>
,
they
wished
him
good
night
in
an
extremely
friendly
manner
,
and
ran
back
as
fast
as
their
feet
would
carry
them
.
   
<EOS>
Will
walked
boldly
to
the
gibbet
,
and
,
glancing
upwards
when
he
came
under
it
,
saw
---
certainly
with
satisfaction
---
that
it
was
empty
,
and
that
nothing
dangled
from
the
top
but
some
iron
chains
,
which
swung
mournfully
to
and
fro
as
they
were
moved
by
the
breeze
.
<EOS>
After
a
careful
survey
of
every
quarter
he
determined
to
take
his
station
with
his
face
towards
the
town
;
both
because
that
would
place
him
with
his
back
to
the
wind
,
and
because
,
if
any
trick
or
surprise
were
attempted
,
it
would
probably
come
from
that
direction
in
the
first
instance
.
 
<EOS>
Having
taken
these
precautions
,
he
wrapped
his
cloak
about
him
so
that
it
left
the
handle
of
his
sword
free
,
and
ready
to
his
hand
,
and
leaning
against
the
gallows
-
tree
with
his
cap
not
quite
so
much
on
one
side
as
it
had
been
before
,
took
up
his
position
for
the
night
.
    
<EOS>
Second
Chapter
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
Tale
 
<EOS>
We
left
Will
Marks
leaning
under
the
gibbet
with
his
face
towards
the
town
,
scanning
the
distance
with
a
keen
eye
,
which
sought
to
pierce
the
darkness
and
catch
the
earliest
glimpse
of
any
person
or
persons
that
might
approach
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
was
quiet
,
and
,
save
the
howling
of
the
wind
as
it
swept
across
the
heath
in
gusts
,
and
the
creaking
of
the
chains
that
dangled
above
his
head
<EOS>
,
there
was
no
sound
to
break
the
sullen
stillness
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
After
half
an
hour
or
so
this
monotony
became
more
disconcerting
to
Will
than
the
most
furious
uproar
would
have
been
,
and
he
heartily
wished
for
some
one
antagonist
with
whom
he
might
have
a
fair
stand
-
up
fight
,
if
it
were
only
to
warm
himself
.
   
<EOS>
Truth
to
tell
,
it
was
a
bitter
wind
,
and
seemed
to
blow
to
the
very
heart
of
a
man
whose
blood
,
heated
but
now
with
rapid
riding
,
<EOS>
was
the
more
sensitive
to
the
chilling
blast
.
 
<EOS>
Will
was
a
daring
fellow
,
and
cared
not
a
jot
for
hard
knocks
or
sharp
blades
;
but
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
move
or
walk
about
,
having
just
that
vague
expectation
of
a
sudden
assault
which
made
it
a
comfortable
thing
to
have
something
at
his
back
,
even
though
that
something
were
a
gallows
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
great
faith
in
the
superstitions
of
the
age
,
<EOS>
still
such
of
them
as
occurred
to
him
did
not
serve
to
lighten
the
time
,
or
to
render
his
situation
the
more
endurable
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
how
witches
were
said
to
repair
at
that
ghostly
hour
to
churchyards
and
gibbets
,
and
such
-
like
dismal
spots
,
to
pluck
the
bleeding
mandrake
or
scrape
the
flesh
from
dead
men
's
bones
,
as
choice
ingredients
for
their
spells
;
how
,
stealing
by
night
to
lonely
places
,
they
dug
graves
with
their
finger
-
nails
,
or
anointed
themselves
before
riding
in
the
air
,
with
a
delicate
pomatum
made
of
the
fat
of
infants
newly
boiled
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
and
many
other
fabled
practices
of
a
no
less
agreeable
nature
,
and
all
having
some
reference
to
the
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
,
passed
and
repassed
in
quick
succession
through
the
mind
of
Will
Marks
,
and
adding
a
shadowy
dread
to
that
distrust
and
watchfulness
which
his
situation
inspired
,
rendered
it
,
upon
the
whole
,
sufficiently
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
foreseen
,
too
,
the
rain
began
to
descend
heavily
,
and
driving
before
the
wind
in
a
thick
mist
,
obscured
even
those
few
objects
which
the
darkness
of
the
night
had
before
imperfectly
revealed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
!
"
shrieked
a
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Great
Heaven
,
it
has
fallen
down
,
and
stands
erect
as
if
it
lived
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
speaker
was
close
behind
him
;
the
voice
was
almost
at
his
ear
.
<EOS>
Will
threw
off
his
cloak
,
drew
his
sword
,
and
darting
swiftly
round
,
seized
a
woman
by
the
wrist
,
who
,
recoiling
from
him
with
a
dreadful
shriek
,
fell
struggling
upon
her
knees
.
 
<EOS>
Another
woman
,
clad
,
like
her
whom
he
had
grasped
,
in
mourning
garments
,
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
on
which
they
were
,
gazing
upon
his
face
with
wild
and
glaring
eyes
that
quite
appalled
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
,
"
cried
Will
,
when
they
had
confronted
each
other
thus
for
some
time
,
"
what
are
ye
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
what
are
YOU
,
"
returned
the
woman
,
"
who
trouble
even
this
obscene
resting
-
place
of
the
dead
,
and
strip
the
gibbet
of
its
honoured
burden
?
 
<EOS>
Where
is
the
body
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
in
wonder
and
affright
from
the
woman
who
questioned
him
to
the
other
whose
arm
he
clutched
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
body
?
"
repeated
the
questioner
more
firmly
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
wear
no
livery
which
marks
you
for
the
hireling
of
the
government
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
no
friend
to
us
,
or
I
should
recognise
you
,
for
the
friends
of
such
as
we
are
few
in
number
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
then
,
and
wherefore
are
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
foe
to
the
distressed
and
helpless
,
"
said
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
ye
among
that
number
?
<EOS>
ye
should
be
by
your
looks
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
!
"
was
the
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
ye
who
have
been
wailing
and
weeping
here
under
cover
of
the
night
?
"
said
Will
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
the
woman
sternly
;
and
pointing
,
as
she
spoke
,
towards
her
companion
,
"
she
mourns
a
husband
,
and
I
a
brother
.
<EOS>
Even
the
bloody
law
that
wreaks
its
vengeance
on
the
dead
does
not
make
that
a
crime
,
and
if
it
did
'
twould
be
alike
to
us
who
are
past
its
fear
or
favour
.
"
   
<EOS>
Will
glanced
at
the
two
females
,
and
could
barely
discern
that
the
one
whom
he
addressed
was
much
the
elder
,
and
that
the
other
was
young
and
of
a
slight
figure
.
 
<EOS>
Both
were
deadly
pale
,
their
garments
wet
and
worn
,
their
hair
dishevelled
and
streaming
in
the
wind
,
themselves
bowed
down
with
grief
and
misery
;
their
whole
appearance
most
dejected
,
wretched
,
and
forlorn
.
 
<EOS>
A
sight
so
different
from
any
he
had
expected
to
encounter
touched
him
to
the
quick
,
and
all
idea
of
anything
but
their
pitiable
condition
vanished
before
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
rough
,
blunt
yeoman
,
"
said
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
I
came
here
is
told
in
a
word
;
you
have
been
overheard
at
a
distance
in
the
silence
of
the
night
,
and
I
have
undertaken
a
watch
for
hags
or
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
here
expecting
an
adventure
,
and
prepared
to
go
through
with
any
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
be
aught
that
I
can
do
to
help
or
aid
you
,
name
it
,
and
on
the
faith
of
a
man
who
can
be
secret
and
trusty
,
I
will
stand
by
you
to
the
death
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
comes
this
gibbet
to
be
empty
?
"
asked
the
elder
female
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
swear
to
you
,
"
replied
Will
,
"
that
I
know
as
little
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
this
I
know
,
that
when
I
came
here
an
hour
ago
or
so
,
it
was
as
it
is
now
;
and
if
,
as
I
gather
from
your
question
,
it
was
not
so
last
night
,
sure
I
am
that
it
has
been
secretly
disturbed
without
the
knowledge
of
the
folks
in
yonder
town
.
 
<EOS>
Bethink
you
,
therefore
,
whether
you
have
no
friends
in
league
with
you
or
with
him
on
whom
the
law
has
done
its
worst
,
by
whom
these
sad
remains
have
been
removed
for
burial
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
women
spoke
together
,
and
Will
retired
a
pace
or
two
while
they
conversed
apart
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
hear
them
sob
and
moan
,
and
saw
that
they
wrung
their
hands
in
fruitless
agony
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
make
out
little
that
they
said
,
but
between
whiles
he
gathered
enough
to
assure
him
that
his
suggestion
was
not
very
wide
of
the
mark
,
and
that
they
not
only
suspected
by
whom
the
body
had
been
removed
,
but
also
whither
it
had
been
conveyed
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
been
in
conversation
a
long
time
,
they
turned
towards
him
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
This
time
the
younger
female
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
offered
us
your
help
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
given
a
pledge
that
you
are
still
willing
to
redeem
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
as
I
may
,
keeping
all
plots
and
conspiracies
at
arm
's
length
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Follow
us
,
friend
.
"
   
Will
,
whose
self
-
possession
was
now
quite
restored
,
needed
no
second
bidding
,
but
with
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
his
cloak
so
muffled
over
his
left
arm
as
to
serve
for
a
kind
of
shield
without
offering
any
impediment
to
its
free
action
,
suffered
them
to
lead
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Through
mud
and
mire
,
and
wind
and
rain
,
they
walked
in
silence
a
full
mile
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
they
turned
into
a
dark
lane
,
where
,
suddenly
starting
out
from
beneath
some
trees
where
he
had
taken
shelter
,
a
man
appeared
,
having
in
his
charge
three
saddled
horses
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
(
his
own
apparently
)
,
<EOS>
in
obedience
to
a
whisper
from
the
women
,
he
consigned
to
Will
,
who
,
seeing
that
they
mounted
,
mounted
also
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
without
a
word
spoken
,
they
rode
on
together
,
leaving
the
attendant
behind
.
   
<EOS>
They
made
no
halt
nor
slackened
their
pace
until
they
arrived
near
Putney
.
 
<EOS>
At
a
large
wooden
house
which
stood
apart
from
any
other
they
alighted
,
and
giving
their
horses
to
one
who
was
already
waiting
,
passed
in
by
a
side
door
,
and
so
up
some
narrow
creaking
stairs
into
a
small
panelled
chamber
,
where
Will
was
left
alone
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
here
very
long
,
when
the
door
was
softly
opened
,
and
there
entered
to
him
a
cavalier
whose
face
was
concealed
beneath
a
black
mask
.
   
<EOS>
Will
stood
upon
his
guard
,
and
scrutinised
this
figure
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
The
form
was
that
of
a
man
pretty
far
advanced
in
life
,
but
of
a
firm
and
stately
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
was
of
a
rich
and
costly
kind
,
but
so
soiled
and
disordered
that
it
was
scarcely
to
be
recognised
for
one
of
those
gorgeous
suits
which
the
expensive
taste
and
fashion
of
the
time
prescribed
for
men
of
any
rank
or
station
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
booted
and
spurred
,
and
bore
about
him
even
as
many
tokens
of
the
state
of
the
roads
as
Will
himself
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
he
noted
,
while
the
eyes
behind
the
mask
regarded
him
with
equal
attention
.
<EOS>
This
survey
over
,
the
cavalier
broke
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thou'rt
young
and
bold
,
and
wouldst
be
richer
than
thou
art
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
two
first
I
am
,
"
returned
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
last
I
have
scarcely
thought
of
.
 
<EOS>
But
be
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
Say
that
I
would
be
richer
than
I
am
;
what
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
way
lies
before
thee
now
,
"
replied
the
Mask
.
   
<EOS>
"
Show
it
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
First
let
me
inform
thee
,
that
thou
wert
brought
here
to
-
night
lest
<EOS>
thou
shouldst
too
soon
have
told
thy
tale
to
those
who
placed
thee
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
as
much
when
I
followed
,
"
said
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
no
blab
,
not
I.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
returned
the
Mask
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
listen
.
 
<EOS>
He
who
was
to
have
executed
the
enterprise
of
burying
that
body
,
which
,
as
thou
hast
suspected
,
was
taken
down
to
-
night
,
has
left
us
in
our
need
.
"
   
<EOS>
Will
nodded
,
and
thought
within
himself
that
if
the
Mask
were
to
attempt
to
play
any
tricks
,
the
first
eyelet
-
hole
on
the
left
-
hand
side
of
his
doublet
,
counting
from
the
buttons
up
the
front
,
would
be
a
very
good
place
in
which
to
pink
him
neatly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
here
,
and
the
emergency
is
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
I
propose
his
task
to
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Convey
the
body
(
now
coffined
in
this
house
)
,
by
means
that
I
shall
show
,
to
the
Church
of
St
Dunstan
in
London
to
-
morrow
night
,
and
thy
service
shall
be
richly
paid
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'rt
about
to
ask
whose
corpse
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Seek
not
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
warn
thee
,
seek
not
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
Felons
hang
in
chains
on
every
moor
and
heath

Believe
,
as
others
do
,
that
this
was
one
,
and
ask
no
further

its

thee

"
   
<EOS>
"
The
mystery
of
this
service
,
"
said
Will
,
"
bespeaks
its
danger
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
reward
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
hundred
golden
unities
,
"
replied
the
cavalier
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
danger
to
one
who
can
not
be
recognised
as
the
friend
of
a
fallen
cause
is
not
great
,
but
there
is
some
hazard
to
be
run
.
 
<EOS>
Decide
between
that
and
the
reward
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
refuse
?
"
said
Will
.
   
<EOS>
"
Depart
in
peace
,
in
God
's
name
,
"
returned
the
Mask
in
a
melancholy
tone
,
"
and
keep
our
secret
,
remembering
that
those
who
brought
thee
here
were
crushed
and
stricken
women
,
and
that
those
who
bade
thee
go
free
could
have
had
thy
life
with
one
word
,
and
no
man
the
wiser
.
"
   
<EOS>
Men
were
readier
to
undertake
desperate
adventures
in
those
times
than
they
are
now
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
case
the
temptation
was
great
,
and
the
punishment
,
even
in
case
of
detection
,
was
not
likely
to
be
very
severe
,
as
Will
came
of
a
loyal
stock
,
and
his
uncle
was
in
good
repute
,
and
a
passable
tale
to
account
for
his
possession
of
the
body
and
his
ignorance
of
the
identity
might
be
easily
devised
.
   
<EOS>
The
cavalier
explained
that
a
coveted
cart
had
been
prepared
for
the
purpose
;
that
the
time
of
departure
could
be
arranged
so
that
he
should
reach
London
Bridge
at
dusk
,
and
proceed
through
the
City
after
the
day
had
closed
in
;
that
people
would
be
ready
at
his
journey
's
end
to
place
the
coffin
in
a
vault
without
a
minute
's
delay
;
that
officious
inquirers
in
the
streets
would
be
easily
repelled
by
the
tale
that
he
was
carrying
for
interment
the
corpse
of
one
who
had
died
of
the
plague
;
and
in
short
showed
him
every
reason
why
he
should
succeed
,
and
none
why
he
should
fail
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
time
they
were
joined
by
another
gentleman
,
masked
like
the
first
,
who
added
new
arguments
to
those
which
had
been
already
urged
;
the
wretched
wife
,
too
,
added
her
tears
and
prayers
to
their
calmer
representations
;
and
in
the
end
,
Will
,
moved
by
compassion
and
good
-
nature
,
by
a
love
of
the
marvellous
,
by
a
mischievous
anticipation
of
the
terrors
of
the
Kingston
people
when
he
should
be
missing
next
day
,
and
finally
,
by
the
prospect
of
gain
,
took
upon
himself
the
task
,
and
devoted
all
his
energies
to
its
successful
execution
.
   
<EOS>
The
following
night
,
when
it
was
quite
dark
,
the
hollow
echoes
of
old
London
Bridge
responded
to
the
rumbling
of
the
cart
which
contained
the
ghastly
load
,
the
object
of
Will
Marks
'
care
.
<EOS>
Sufficiently
disguised
to
attract
no
attention
by
his
garb
,
Will
walked
at
the
horse
's
head
,
as
unconcerned
as
a
man
could
be
who
was
sensible
that
he
had
now
arrived
at
the
most
dangerous
part
of
his
undertaking
,
but
full
of
boldness
and
confidence
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
now
eight
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
After
nine
,
none
could
walk
the
streets
without
danger
of
their
lives
,
and
even
at
this
hour
,
robberies
and
murder
were
of
no
uncommon
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
The
shops
upon
the
bridge
were
all
closed
;
the
low
wooden
arches
thrown
across
the
way
were
like
so
many
black
pits
,
in
every
one
of
which
ill
-
favoured
fellows
lurked
in
knots
of
three
or
four
;
some
standing
upright
against
the
wall
,
lying
in
wait
;
others
skulking
in
gateways
,
and
thrusting
out
their
uncombed
heads
and
scowling
eyes
:
 
others
crossing
and
recrossing
,
and
constantly
jostling
both
horse
and
man
to
provoke
a
quarrel
;
others
stealing
away
and
summoning
their
companions
in
a
low
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
even
in
that
short
passage
,
there
was
the
noise
of
scuffling
and
the
clash
of
swords
behind
him
,
but
Will
,
who
knew
the
City
and
its
ways
,
kept
straight
on
and
scarcely
turned
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
The
streets
being
unpaved
,
the
rain
of
the
night
before
had
converted
them
into
a
perfect
quagmire
,
which
the
splashing
water-
spouts
from
the
gables
,
and
the
filth
and
offal
cast
from
the
different
houses
,
swelled
in
no
small
degree
.
 
<EOS>
These
odious
matters
being
left
to
putrefy
in
the
close
and
heavy
air
,
emitted
an
insupportable
stench
,
to
which
every
court
and
passage
poured
forth
a
contribution
of
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
Many
parts
,
even
of
the
main
streets
,
with
their
projecting
stories
tottering
overhead
and
nearly
shutting
out
the
sky
,
were
more
like
huge
chimneys
than
open
ways
.
<EOS>
At
the
corners
of
some
of
these
,
great
bonfires
were
burning
to
prevent
infection
from
the
plague
,
of
which
it
was
rumoured
that
some
citizens
had
lately
died
;
and
few
,
who
availing
themselves
of
the
light
thus
afforded
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
around
them
,
would
have
been
disposed
to
doubt
the
existence
of
the
disease
,
or
wonder
at
its
dreadful
visitations
.
   
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
in
such
scenes
as
these
,
or
even
in
the
deep
and
miry
road
,
that
Will
Marks
found
the
chief
obstacles
to
his
progress
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
kites
and
ravens
feeding
in
the
streets
(
the
only
scavengers
the
City
kept
)
,
who
,
scenting
what
he
carried
,
followed
the
cart
or
fluttered
on
its
top
,
and
croaked
their
knowledge
of
its
burden
and
their
ravenous
appetite
for
prey
.
<EOS>
There
were
distant
fires
,
where
the
poor
wood
and
plaster
tenements
wasted
fiercely
,
and
whither
crowds
made
their
way
,
clamouring
eagerly
for
plunder
,
beating
down
all
who
came
within
their
reach
,
and
yelling
like
devils
<EOS>
let
loose
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
single
-
handed
men
flying
from
bands
of
ruffians
,
who
pursued
them
with
naked
weapons
,
and
hunted
them
savagely
;
there
were
drunken
,
desperate
robbers
issuing
from
their
dens
and
staggering
through
the
open
streets
where
no
man
dared
molest
them
;
there
were
vagabond
servitors
returning
from
the
Bear
Garden
,
where
had
been
good
sport
that
day
,
dragging
after
them
their
torn
and
bleeding
dogs
,
or
leaving
them
to
die
and
rot
upon
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
was
abroad
but
cruelty
,
violence
,
and
disorder
.
   
<EOS>
Many
were
the
interruptions
which
Will
Marks
encountered
from
these
stragglers
,
and
many
the
narrow
escapes
he
made
.
 
<EOS>
Now
some
stout
bully
would
take
his
seat
upon
the
cart
,
insisting
to
be
driven
to
his
own
home
,
and
now
two
or
three
men
would
come
down
upon
him
together
,
and
demand
that
on
peril
of
his
life
he
showed
them
what
he
had
inside
.
 
<EOS>
Then
a
party
of
the
city
watch
,
upon
their
rounds
,
would
draw
across
the
road
,
and
not
satisfied
with
his
tale
,
question
him
closely
,
and
revenge
themselves
by
a
little
cuffing
and
hustling
for
maltreatment
sustained
at
other
hands
that
night
.
<EOS>
All
these
assailants
had
to
be
rebutted
,
some
by
fair
words
,
some
by
foul
,
and
some
by
blows
.
 
<EOS>
But
Will
Marks
was
not
the
man
to
be
stopped
or
turned
back
<EOS>
now
he
had
penetrated
so
far
,
and
though
he
got
on
slowly
,
still
he
made
his
way
down
Fleet
-
street
and
reached
the
church
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
had
been
forewarned
,
all
was
in
readiness
.
 
<EOS>
Directly
he
stopped
,
the
coffin
was
removed
by
four
men
,
who
appeared
so
suddenly
that
they
seemed
to
have
started
from
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
A
fifth
mounted
the
cart
,
and
scarcely
allowing
Will
time
to
snatch
from
it
a
little
bundle
containing
such
of
his
own
clothes
as
he
had
thrown
off
on
assuming
his
disguise
,
drove
briskly
away
.
 
<EOS>
Will
never
saw
cart
or
man
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
followed
the
body
into
the
church
,
and
it
was
well
he
lost
no
time
in
doing
so
,
for
the
door
was
immediately
closed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
light
in
the
building
save
that
which
came
from
a
couple
of
torches
borne
by
two
men
in
cloaks
,
who
stood
upon
the
brink
of
a
vault
.
 
<EOS>
Each
supported
a
female
figure
,
and
all
observed
a
profound
silence
.
   
<EOS>
By
this
dim
and
solemn
glare
,
which
made
Will
feel
as
though
light
itself
were
dead
,
and
its
tomb
the
dreary
arches
that
frowned
above
,
they
placed
the
coffin
in
the
vault
,
with
uncovered
heads
,
and
closed
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
torch
-
bearers
then
turned
to
Will
,
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
,
in
which
was
a
purse
of
gold
.
<EOS>
Something
told
him
directly
that
those
were
the
same
eyes
which
he
had
seen
beneath
the
mask
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
it
,
"
said
the
cavalier
in
a
low
voice
,
"
and
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Though
these
have
been
hasty
obsequies
,
and
no
priest
has
blessed
the
work
,
there
will
not
be
the
less
peace
with
thee
thereafter
,
for
having
laid
his
bones
beside
those
of
his
little
children
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
thy
own
counsel
,
for
thy
sake
no
less
than
ours
,
and
God
be
with
thee
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
blessing
of
a
widowed
mother
on
thy
head
,
good
friend
!
"
cried
the
younger
lady
through
her
tears
;
"
the
blessing
of
one
who
has
now
no
hope
or
rest
but
in
this
grave
!
"
   
<EOS>
Will
stood
with
the
purse
in
his
hand
,
and
involuntarily
made
a
gesture
as
though
he
would
return
it
,
for
though
a
thoughtless
fellow
,
he
was
of
a
frank
and
generous
nature
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
two
gentlemen
,
extinguishing
their
torches
,
cautioned
him
to
be
gone
,
as
their
common
safety
would
be
endangered
by
a
longer
delay
;
and
at
the
same
time
their
retreating
footsteps
sounded
through
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
,
therefore
,
towards
the
point
at
which
he
had
entered
,
and
seeing
by
a
faint
gleam
in
the
distance
that
the
door
was
again
partially
open
,
groped
his
way
towards
it
and
so
passed
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
Meantime
the
local
authorities
of
Kingston
had
kept
watch
and
ward
all
the
previous
night
,
fancying
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
that
dismal
shrieks
were
borne
towards
them
on
the
wind
,
and
frequently
winking
to
each
other
,
and
drawing
closer
to
the
fire
as
they
drank
the
health
of
the
lonely
sentinel
,
upon
whom
a
clerical
gentleman
present
was
especially
severe
by
reason
of
his
levity
and
youthful
folly
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
of
the
gravest
in
company
,
who
were
of
a
theological
turn
,
propounded
to
him
the
question
,
whether
such
a
character
was
not
but
poorly
armed
for
single
combat
with
the
Devil
,
and
whether
he
himself
would
not
have
been
a
stronger
opponent
;
but
the
clerical
gentleman
,
sharply
reproving
them
for
their
presumption
in
discussing
such
questions
,
clearly
showed
that
a
fitter
champion
than
Will
could
scarcely
have
been
selected
,
not
only
for
that
being
a
child
of
Satan
,
he
was
the
less
likely
to
be
alarmed
by
the
appearance
of
his
own
father
,
but
because
Satan
himself
would
be
at
his
ease
in
such
company
,
and
would
not
scruple
to
kick
up
his
heels
to
an
extent
which
it
was
quite
certain
he
would
never
venture
before
clerical
eyes
,
under
whose
influence
(
as
was
notorious
)
<EOS>
he
became
quite
a
tame
and
milk
-
and
-
water
character
.
   
<EOS>
But
when
next
morning
arrived
,
and
with
it
no
Will
Marks
,
and
when
a
strong
party
repairing
to
the
spot
,
as
a
strong
party
ventured
to
do
in
broad
day
,
found
Will
gone
and
the
gibbet
empty
<EOS>
,
matters
grew
serious
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
passing
away
and
no
news
arriving
,
and
the
night
going
on
also
without
any
intelligence
,
the
thing
grew
more
tremendous
still
;
in
short
,
the
neighbourhood
worked
itself
up
to
such
a
comfortable
pitch
of
mystery
and
horror
,
that
it
is
a
great
question
whether
the
general
feeling
was
not
one
of
excessive
disappointment
,
when
,
on
the
second
morning
,
Will
Marks
returned
.
   
<EOS>
However
this
may
be
,
back
Will
came
in
a
very
cool
and
collected
state
,
and
appearing
not
to
trouble
himself
much
about
anybody
except
old
John
Podgers
,
who
,
having
been
sent
for
,
was
sitting
in
the
Town
Hall
crying
slowly
,
and
dozing
between
whiles
.
 
<EOS>
Having
embraced
his
uncle
and
assured
him
of
his
safety
,
Will
mounted
on
a
table
and
told
his
story
to
the
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
And
surely
they
would
have
been
the
most
unreasonable
crowd
that
ever
assembled
together
,
if
they
had
been
in
the
least
respect
disappointed
with
the
tale
he
told
them
;
for
besides
describing
the
Witches
'
Dance
to
the
minutest
motion
of
their
legs
,
and
performing
it
in
character
on
the
table
,
with
the
assistance
of
a
broomstick
,
he
related
how
they
had
carried
off
the
body
in
a
copper
caldron
,
and
so
bewitched
him
,
that
he
lost
his
senses
until
he
found
himself
lying
under
a
hedge
at
least
ten
miles
off
,
whence
he
had
straightway
returned
as
they
then
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
The
story
gained
such
universal
applause
that
it
soon
afterwards
brought
down
express
from
London
<EOS>
the
great
witch
-
finder
of
the
age
,
the
Heaven
-
born
Hopkins
,
who
having
examined
Will
closely
on
several
points
,
pronounced
it
the
most
extraordinary
and
the
best
accredited
witch-
story
ever
known
,
under
which
title
it
was
published
at
the
Three
Bibles
on
London
Bridge
,
in
small
quarto
,
with
a
view
of
the
caldron
from
an
original
drawing
,
and
a
portrait
of
the
clerical
gentleman
as
he
sat
by
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
On
one
point
Will
was
particularly
careful
:
 
and
that
was
to
describe
for
the
witches
he
had
seen
,
three
impossible
old
females
,
whose
likenesses
never
were
or
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
he
saved
the
lives
of
the
suspected
parties
,
and
of
all
other
old
women
who
were
dragged
before
him
to
be
identified
.
   
<EOS>
This
circumstance
occasioned
John
Podgers
much
grief
and
sorrow
,
until
happening
one
day
to
cast
his
eyes
upon
his
house
-
keeper
,
and
observing
her
to
be
plainly
afflicted
with
rheumatism
,
he
procured
her
to
be
burnt
as
an
undoubted
witch
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
service
to
the
state
he
was
immediately
knighted
,
and
became
from
that
time
Sir
John
Podgers
.
   
<EOS>
Will
Marks
never
gained
any
clue
to
the
mystery
in
which
he
had
been
an
actor
,
nor
did
any
inscription
in
the
church
,
which
he
often
visited
afterwards
,
nor
any
of
the
limited
inquiries
that
he
dared
to
make
,
yield
him
the
least
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
kept
his
own
secret
,
he
was
compelled
to
spend
the
gold
discreetly
and
sparingly
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
time
he
married
the
young
lady
of
whom
I
have
already
told
you
,
whose
maiden
name
is
not
recorded
,
with
whom
he
led
a
prosperous
and
happy
life
.
 
<EOS>
Years
and
years
after
this
adventure
,
it
was
his
wo
nt
to
tell
her
upon
a
stormy
night
that
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
him
to
think
those
bones
,
to
whomsoever
they
might
have
once
belonged
,
were
not
bleaching
in
the
troubled
air
,
but
were
mouldering
away
with
the
dust
of
their
own
kith
and
kindred
in
a
quiet
grave
.

Further
particulars
of
Master
Humphrey
's
Visitor
 
Being
very
full
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
application
,
and
highly
pleased
with
the
compliment
he
had
paid
me
,
it
will
be
readily
supposed
that
long
before
our
next
night
of
meeting
I
communicated
it
to
my
three
friends
,
who
unanimously
voted
his
admission
into
our
body
.
<EOS>
We
all
looked
forward
with
some
impatience
to
the
occasion
which
would
enroll
him
among
us
,
but
I
am
greatly
mistaken
if
Jack
Redburn
and
myself
were
not
by
many
degrees
the
most
impatient
of
the
party
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
night
came
,
and
a
few
minutes
after
ten
Mr
Pickwick
's
knock
was
heard
at
the
street
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
shown
into
a
lower
room
,
and
I
directly
took
my
crooked
stick
and
went
to
accompany
him
up
-
stairs
,
in
order
that
he
might
be
presented
with
all
honour
and
formality
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
said
I
,
on
entering
the
room
,
"
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
,
---
rejoiced
to
believe
that
this
is
<EOS>
but
the
opening
of
a
long
series
of
visits
to
this
house
,
and
but
the
beginning
of
a
close
and
lasting
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
That
gentleman
made
a
suitable
reply
with
a
cordiality
and
frankness
peculiarly
his
own
,
and
glanced
with
a
smile
towards
two
persons
behind
the
door
,
whom
I
had
not
at
first
observed
,
and
whom
I
immediately
recognised
as
Mr
Samuel
Weller
and
his
father
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
warm
evening
,
but
the
elder
Mr
Weller
was
attired
,
notwithstanding
,
in
a
most
capacious
greatcoat
,
and
his
chin
enveloped
in
a
large
speckled
shawl
,
such
as
is
usually
worn
by
stage
coachmen
on
active
service
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
very
rosy
and
very
stout
,
especially
about
the
legs
,
which
appeared
to
have
been
compressed
into
his
top
-
boots
with
some
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
His
broad-
brimmed
hat
he
held
under
his
left
arm
,
and
with
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
he
touched
his
forehead
a
great
many
times
in
acknowledgment
of
my
presence
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
in
such
good
health
,
Mr
Weller
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
thankee
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Weller
,
"
the
axle
an't
broke
yet

<EOS>
We
keeps
up
a
steady
pace
,

not

My
son
Samivel
,
sir

as

may
have
read
on
in
history

"
added
Mr
Weller
,
introducing
his
first
-
born
.
   
<EOS>
I
received
Sam
very
graciously
,
but
before
he
could
say
a
word
his
father
struck
in
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Samivel
Veller
,

"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
has
conferred

the

that

about

unbeknown

"
   
<EOS>
"
Be

said
Sam
;
<EOS>
"
I
never

a

magpie

never

"
   
<EOS>
"
That
'
ere
Tony
is
the
blessedest
boy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
heedless
of
this
rebuff
,
"
the
blessedest
boy
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see

MY
days

<EOS>
of

the
charmin'est

kivered
over

there
never

Tony

<EOS>
He

alvays
a

a
quart
pot
,
that
boy
is
!
<EOS>
To
see
him
a
settin
'
down
on
the
doorstep
pretending
to
drink
out
of
it
,
and
fetching
a
long
breath
artervards
,
and
smoking
a
bit
of
firevood
,
and
sayin
'
,
"
Now
I
'm
grandfather
,
"
---
to
see
him
a
doin'
that
at
two
year
old
is
better
than
any
play
as
wos
ever
wrote
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I

"
 
<EOS>
He
would
n't
take
a
pint
pot
if
you
wos
to
make
him
a
present
on
it
,
but
he
gets
his
quart
,
and
then
he
says
,
"
Now
I
'm
grandfather
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Weller
was
so
overpowered
by
this
picture
that
he
straightway
fell
into
a
most
alarming
fit
of
coughing
,
which
must
certainly
have
been
attended
with
some
fatal
result
but
for
the
dexterity
and
promptitude
of
Sam
,
who
,
taking
a
firm
grasp
of
the
shawl
just
under
his
father
's
chin
,
shook
him
to
and
fro
with
great
violence
,
at
the
same
time
administering
some
smart
blows
between
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
curious
mode
of
treatment
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
finally
recovered
,
but
with
a
very
crimson
face
,
and
in
a
state
of
great
exhaustion
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
do
now
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
had
been
in
some
alarm
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
do
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sam
,
looking
reproachfully
at
his
parent
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
WILL
do
one
o
'
these
days
,

he
'll
do
for
his

self
<EOS>
and
then
he
'll
wish

<EOS>
Did
anybody
ever
see
sich
a
inconsiderate
old
file
,
---
laughing
into
conwulsions
afore
company
,
and
stamping
on
the
floor
as
if
he
'd
brought
his
own
carpet
vith
him
and
wos
under
a
wager
to
punch
the
pattern
out
in
a
given
time
?
<EOS>
He
'll
begin
again
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
There
<EOS>
---
he
's
a
goin'
off
---
I
said
he
would

"
   
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Mr
Weller
,
whose
mind
was
still
running
upon
his
precocious
grandson
,
was
seen
to
shake
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
while
a
laugh
,
working
like
an
earthquake
,
below
the
surface
,
produced
various
extraordinary
appearances
in
his
face
,
chest
,
and
shoulders
,
---
the
more
alarming
because
unaccompanied
by
any
noise
<EOS>
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
These
emotions
,
however
,
gradually
subsided
,
and
after
three
or
four
short
relapses
he
wiped
his
eyes
with
the
cuff
of
his
coat
,
and
looked
about
him
with
tolerable
composure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Afore

"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
there

<EOS>
"
Wot

demanded
Sam
,
seizing
his
father
by
the
coat

tail
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
such
a
undootiful
boy
as

returned
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did

<EOS>
"
Well

said
Sam
,
"

The

said
Sam
,
addressing
me
,
"
that
he
wants
to
know

<EOS>

said
Sam

grinning
still
more
,
"
he
wishes
to
know
vether
she
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
In
short
,
"
interposed
old
Mr
Weller
decisively
,
a
perspiration
breaking
out
upon
his
forehead
,
"
vether
that
'
ere
old
creetur
is
or
is
not

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
laughed
heartily
,
and
so
did
I
,
as
I
replied
decisively
,
that
"
my
housekeeper
was
a
spinster
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
cried
Sam
,
"
now
you
're
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
You
hear
she
's
a
spinster
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
wot
?
<EOS>
"
said
his
father
,
with
deep
scorn
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
spinster
,
"
replied
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
looked
very
hard
at
his
son
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
said
,
   
"
Never
mind
vether
<EOS>
she
makes
jokes
or
not

that
's
no
matter

<EOS>
Wot
<EOS>
I

"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
do
you
mean
by
her
making
jokes
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sam
,
quite
aghast
at
the
obscurity
of
his
parent
's
speech
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
you
mind
,
Samivel
,
"
returned
Mr
Weller
gravely
;
"
puns
may
be
wery
good
things
or
they
may
be
wery
bad

<EOS>
uns
,
and
a

be
none

better
<EOS>
or
she
may
be
none

that

got
nothing

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
now
,
"
said
Sam
,
looking
round
,
"
would
anybody
believe
as
a
man
at
his
time
o

life
could
be
running
his

agin

"
   
<EOS>
"
There
an't
a
straw
's
difference

"
said
Mr
Weller
.
<EOS>
"
Your
father
did
n't
drive
a

for
so
many
years

not

as
far

THAT
goes

Sammy

"
   
<EOS>
Avoiding
the
question
of
etymology
,
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
's
mind
was
quite
made
up
,
he
was
several
times
assured
that
the
housekeeper
had
never
been
married
.
 
<EOS>
He
expressed
great
satisfaction
on
hearing
this
,
and
apologised
for
the
question
,
remarking
that
he
had
been
greatly
terrified
by
a
widow
not
long
before
,
and
that
his
natural
timidity
was
increased
in
consequence
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
wos
on
the
rail
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
with
strong
emphasis
;
"
I
wos
a
goin'
down
to
Birmingham
by
the
rail
,
and
<EOS>
I
wos
locked
up
in

carriage
vith
a
living
widder
.
 
<EOS>
Alone
we
wos
;
the
widder
and
me
wos
alone
;
and
I
believe
it
wos
only
because
we
WOS
alone
and
there
wos
no
clergyman
in
the
conwayance
,
<EOS>
that
that
'
ere

did
n't
marry
me
afore

reached
the

<EOS>
Ven
<EOS>
I
think
how
she
began
a
screaming
as
we
wos
a
goin'
under
them
tunnels
in
the
dark
,
---
how
she
kept
on
a
faintin

ketchin

and
how
I
tried
to

tight

Ah

<EOS>
It

awful

most

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
so
very
much
overcome
by
this
retrospect
that
he
was
unable
,
until
he
had
wiped
his
brow
several
times
,
to
return
any
reply
to
the
question
whether
he
approved
of
railway
communication
,
notwithstanding
that
it
would
appear
from
the
answer
which
he
ultimately
gave
,
that
he
entertained
strong
opinions
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"

Mr

"
<EOS>
"
   
By
this
time
I
began
to
fear
that
my
friends
would
be
rendered
impatient
by
my
protracted
absence
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
begged
Mr
Pickwick
to
accompany
me
up
-
stairs
,
and
left
the
two
Mr
Wellers
in
the
care
of
the
housekeeper
,
laying
strict
injunctions
upon
her
to
treat
them
with
all
possible
hospitality
.
     
<EOS>
IV
 
<EOS>
The
Clock
 
<EOS>
As
we
were
going
up
-
stairs
,
Mr
Pickwick
put
on
his
spectacles
,
which
he
had
held
in
his
hand
hitherto
;
arranged
his
neckerchief
,
smoothed
down
his
waistcoat
,
and
made
many
other
little
preparations
of
that
kind
which
men
are
accustomed
to
be
mindful
of
,
when
they
are
going
among
strangers
for
the
first
time
,
and
are
anxious
to
impress
them
pleasantly
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
that
I
smiled
,
he
smiled
too
,
and
said
that
if
it
had
occurred
to
him
before
he
left
home
,
he
would
certainly
have
presented
himself
in
pumps
and
silk
stockings
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
indeed
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
he
said
very
seriously
;
"
I
would
have
shown
my
respect
for
the
society
,
by
laying
aside
my
gaiters
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
rest
assured
,
"
said
I
,
"
that
they
would
have
regretted
your
doing
so
very
much
,
for
they
are
quite
attached
to
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
really
!
"
cried
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
manifest
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
they
care
about
my
gaiters
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
seriously
think
that
they
identify
me
at
all
with
my
gaiters
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
they
do
,
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
is
one
of
the
most
charming
and
agreeable
circumstances
that
could
possibly
have
occurred
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
written
down
this
short
conversation
,
but
that
it
developed
a
slight
point
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
character
,
with
which
I
was
not
previously
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
secret
pride
in
his
legs
.
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
he
spoke
,
and
the
accompanying
glance
he
bestowed
upon
his
tights
,
convince
me
that
Mr
Pickwick
regards
his
legs
with
much
innocent
vanity
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
here
are
our
friends
,
"
said
I
,
opening
the
door
and
taking
his
arm
in
mine
;
"
let
them
speak
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
---
Gentlemen
,
I
present
to
you
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
I
must
have
been
a
good
contrast
just
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
leaning
quietly
on
my
crutch
-
stick
,
with
something
of
a
care
-
worn
,
patient
air
<EOS>
;
he
,
having
hold
of
my
arm
,
and
bowing
in
every
direction
with
the
most
elastic
politeness
,
and
an
expression
of
face
whose
sprightly
cheerfulness
and
good
-
humour
knew
no
bounds
.
<EOS>
The
difference
between
us
must
have
been
more
striking
yet
,
as
we
advanced
towards
the
table
,
and
the
amiable
gentleman
,
adapting
his
jocund
step
to
my
poor
tread
,
had
his
attention
divided
between
treating
my
infirmities
with
the
utmost
consideration
,
and
affecting
to
be
wholly
unconscious
that
I
required
any
.
   
<EOS>
I
made
him
personally
known
to
each
of
my
friends
in
turn
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
to
the
deaf
gentleman
,
whom
he
regarded
with
much
interest
,
and
accosted
with
great
frankness
and
cordiality
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
evidently
some
vague
idea
,
at
the
moment
,
that
my
friend
being
deaf
must
be
dumb
also
;
for
when
the
latter
opened
his
lips
to
express
the
pleasure
it
afforded
him
to
know
a
gentleman
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
,
Mr
Pickwick
was
so
extremely
disconcerted
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
step
in
to
his
relief
.
   
<EOS>
His
meeting
with
Jack
Redburn
was
quite
a
treat
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
smiled
,
and
shook
hands
,
and
looked
at
him
through
his
spectacles
,
and
under
them
,
and
over
them
,
and
nodded
his
head
approvingly
,
and
then
nodded
to
me
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
This
is
just
the
man
;
you
were
quite
right
;
"
and
then
turned
to
Jack
and
said
a
few
hearty
words
,
and
then
did
and
said
everything
over
again
with
unimpaired
vivacity
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Jack
himself
,
he
was
quite
as
much
delighted
with
Mr
Pickwick
as
Mr
Pickwick
could
possibly
be
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Two
people
never
can
have
met
together
since
the
world
began
,
who
exchanged
a
warmer
or
more
enthusiastic
greeting
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
amusing
to
observe
the
difference
between
this
encounter
and
that
which
succeeded
,
between
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Miles
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
the
latter
gentleman
viewed
our
new
member
as
a
kind
of
rival
in
the
affections
of
Jack
Redburn
,
and
<EOS>
besides
this
,
he
had
more
than
once
hinted
to
me
,
in
secret
,
that
although
he
had
no
doubt
Mr
Pickwick
was
a
very
worthy
man
,
still
he
did
consider
that
some
of
his
exploits
were
unbecoming
a
gentleman
of
his
years
and
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
Over
and
above
these
grounds
of
distrust
,
it
is
one
of
his
fixed
opinions
,
that
the
law
never
can
by
possibility
do
anything
wrong
;
he
therefore
looks
upon
Mr
Pickwick
as
one
who
has
justly
suffered
in
purse
and
peace
for
a
breach
of
his
plighted
faith
to
an
unprotected
female
,
and
holds
that
he
is
called
upon
to
regard
him
with
some
suspicion
on
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
These
causes
led
to
a
rather
cold
and
formal
reception
;
which
Mr
Pickwick
acknowledged
with
the
same
stateliness
and
intense
politeness
as
was
displayed
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
assumed
an
air
of
such
majestic
defiance
,
that
I
was
fearful
he
might
break
out
into
some
solemn
protest
or
declaration
,
and
therefore
inducted
him
into
his
chair
without
a
moment
's
delay
.
   
<EOS>
This
piece
of
generalship
was
perfectly
successful
.
 
<EOS>
The
instant
he
took
his
seat
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pickwick
surveyed
us
all
with
a
most
benevolent
aspect
,
and
was
taken
with
a
fit
of
smiling
full
five
minutes
long
.
<EOS>
His
interest
in
our
ceremonies
was
immense
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
very
numerous
or
complicated
,
and
a
description
of
them
may
be
comprised
in
very
few
words
.
 
<EOS>
As
our
transactions
have
already
been
,
and
must
necessarily
continue
to
be
,
more
or
less
anticipated
by
being
presented
in
these
pages
at
different
times
,
and
under
various
forms
,
they
do
not
require
a
detailed
account
.
   
<EOS>
Our
first
proceeding
when
we
are
assembled
is
to
shake
hands
all
round
,
and
greet
each
other
with
cheerful
and
pleasant
looks
.
<EOS>
Remembering
that
we
assemble
not
only
for
the
promotion
of
our
happiness
,
but
<EOS>
with
the
view
of
adding
something
to
the
common
stock
,
an
air
of
languor
or
indifference
in
any
member
of
our
body
would
be
regarded
by
the
others
as
a
kind
of
treason
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
never
had
an
offender
in
this
respect
;
but
if
we
had
,
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
taken
to
task
pretty
severely
.
   
<EOS>
Our
salutation
over
,
the
venerable
piece
of
antiquity
from
which
we
take
our
name
is
wound
up
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
The
ceremony
is
always
performed
by
Master
Humphrey
himself
(
in
treating
of
the
club
,
I
may
be
permitted
to
assume
the
historical
style
,
and
speak
of
myself
in
the
third
person
)
,
who
mounts
upon
a
chair
for
the
purpose
,
armed
with
a
large
key
.
 
<EOS>
While
it
is
in
progress
,
Jack
Redburn
is
required
to
keep
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
under
the
guardianship
of
Mr
Miles
,
for
he
is
known
to
entertain
certain
aspiring
and
unhallowed
thoughts
connected
with
the
clock
,
and
has
even
gone
so
far
as
to
state
that
if
he
might
take
the
works
out
for
a
day
or
two
,
he
thinks
he
could
improve
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
pardon
him
his
presumption
in
consideration
of
his
good
intentions
,
and
his
keeping
this
respectful
distance
,
which
last
penalty
is
insisted
on
,
lest
by
secretly
wounding
the
object
of
our
regard
in
some
tender
part
,
in
the
ardour
of
his
zeal
for
its
improvement
,
he
should
fill
us
with
dismay
and
consternation
.
   
<EOS>
This
regulation
afforded
Mr
Pickwick
the
highest
delight
,
and
seemed
,
if
possible
,
to
exalt
Jack
in
his
good
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
ceremony
is
the
opening
of
the
clock
-
case
(
of
which
Master
Humphrey
has
likewise
the
key
)
,
the
taking
from
it
as
many
papers
as
will
furnish
forth
our
evening
's
entertainment
,
and
arranging
in
the
recess
<EOS>
such
new
contributions
as
have
been
provided
since
our
last
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
always
done
with
peculiar
solemnity
.
 
<EOS>
The
deaf
gentleman
then
fills
and
lights
his
pipe
,
and
we
once
more
take
our
seats
round
the
table
before
mentioned
,
Master
Humphrey
acting
as
president
,
---
if
we
can
be
said
to
have
any
president
,
where
all
are
on
the
same
social
footing
,
---
and
our
friend
Jack
as
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
Our
preliminaries
being
now
concluded
,
we
fall
into
any
train
of
conversation
that
happens
to
suggest
itself
,
or
proceed
immediately
to
one
of
our
readings
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
latter
case
,
the
paper
selected
is
consigned
to
Master
Humphrey
,
who
flattens
it
carefully
on
the
table
and
makes
dog
's
ears
in
the
corner
of
every
page
,
ready
for
turning
over
easily
;
Jack
Redburn
trims
the
lamp
with
a
small
machine
of
his
own
invention
which
usually
puts
it
out
;
Mr
Miles
looks
on
with
great
approval
notwithstanding
;
the
deaf
gentleman
draws
in
his
chair
,
so
that
he
can
follow
the
words
on
the
paper
or
on
Master
Humphrey
's
lips
as
he
pleases
;
and
Master
Humphrey
himself
,
looking
round
with
mighty
gratification
,
and
glancing
up
at
his
old
clock
,
begins
to
read
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
face
,
while
his
tale
was
being
read
,
would
have
attracted
the
attention
of
the
dullest
man
alive
.
 
<EOS>
The
complacent
motion
of
his
head
and
forefinger
as
he
gently
beat
time
,
and
corrected
the
air
with
imaginary
punctuation
,
the
smile
that
mantled
on
his
features
at
every
jocose
passage
,
and
the
sly
look
he
stole
around
to
observe
its
effect
,
the
calm
manner
in
which
he
shut
his
eyes
and
listened
when
there
was
some
little
piece
of
description
,
the
changing
expression
with
which
he
acted
the
dialogue
to
himself
,
his
agony
that
the
deaf
gentleman
should
know
what
it
was
all
about
,
and
his
extraordinary
anxiety
to
correct
the
reader
when
he
hesitated
at
a
word
in
the
manuscript
,
or
substituted
a
wrong
one
,
were
alike
worthy
of
remark
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
at
last
,
endeavouring
to
communicate
with
the
deaf
gentleman
by
means
of
the
finger
alphabet
,
with
which
he
constructed
such
words
as
are
unknown
in
any
civilised
or
savage
language
,
he
took
up
a
slate
and
wrote
in
large
text
,
one
word
in
a
line
,
the
question
,
"
How
---
do
---
<EOS>
you
---
like
---
it
?
"
---
when
he
did
this
,
and
handing
it
over
the
table
awaited
the
reply
,
with
a
countenance
only
brightened
and
improved
by
his
great
excitement
,
even
Mr
Miles
relaxed
,
and
could
not
forbear
looking
at
him
for
the
moment
with
interest
and
favour
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
occurred
to
me
,
"
said
the
deaf
gentleman
,
who
had
watched
Mr
Pickwick
and
everybody
else
with
silent
satisfaction
---
"
it
has
occurred
to
me
,
"
said
the
deaf
gentleman
,
taking
his
pipe
from
his
lips
,
"
that
now
is
our
time
for
filling
our
only
empty
chair
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
our
conversation
had
naturally
turned
upon
the
vacant
seat
,
we
lent
a
willing
ear
to
this
remark
,
and
looked
at
our
friend
inquiringly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
Mr
Pickwick
must
be
acquainted
with
somebody
who
would
be
an
acquisition
to
us
;
that
he
must
know
the
man
we
want
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
not
lose
any
time
,
but
set
this
question
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
so
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
addressed
was
about
to
return
a
verbal
reply
,
but
remembering
our
friend
's
infirmity
,
he
substituted
for
this
kind
of
answer
some
fifty
nods
.
 
<EOS>
Then
taking
up
the
slate
and
printing
on
it
<EOS>
a
gigantic
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
handed
it
across
the
table
,
and
rubbing
his
hands
as
he
looked
round
upon
our
faces
,
protested
that
he
and
the
deaf
gentleman
quite
understood
each
other
,
already
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
person
I
have
in
my
mind
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
and
whom
I
should
not
have
presumed
to
mention
to
you
until
some
time
hence
,
but
for
the
opportunity
you
have
given
me
,
is
a
very
strange
old

<EOS>
His
name
is
Bamber
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bamber
!
"
said
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
certainly
heard
the
name
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
,
then
,
"
returned
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
you
remember
him
in
those
adventures
of
mine
(
the
Posthumous
Papers
of
our
old
club
,
I
mean
)
,
although
he
is
only
incidentally
mentioned
;
and
,
if
I
remember
right
,
appears
but
once
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
"
said
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
person
who
has
a
grave
interest
in
old
mouldy
chambers
and
the
Inns
of
Court
,
and
who
relates
some
anecdotes
having
reference
to
his
favourite
theme
,
---
and
an
odd
ghost
story
,
---
is
that
the
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
same
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
lowering
his
voice
to
a
mysterious
and
confidential
tone
,
"
he
is
a
very
extraordinary
and
remarkable
person
;
living
,
and
talking
,
and
looking
,
like
some
strange
spirit
,
whose
delight
is
to
haunt
old
buildings
;
and
absorbed
in
that
one
subject
which
you
have
just
mentioned
,
to
an
extent
which
is
quite
wonderful
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
retired
into
private
life
,
I
sought
him
out
,
and
I
do
assure
you
that
the
more
I
see
of
him
,
the
more
strongly
I
am
impressed
with
the
strange
and
dreamy
character
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
does
he
live
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
lives
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
in
one
of
those
dull
,
lonely
old
places
with
which
his
thoughts
and
stories
are
all
connected
;
quite
alone
,
and
often
shut
up
close
for
several
weeks
together
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
dusty
solitude
he
broods
upon
the
fancies
he
has
so
long
indulged
,
and
when
he
goes
into
the
world
,
or
anybody
from
the
world
without
goes
to
see
him
,
they
are
still
present
to
his
mind
and
still
his
favourite
topic
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
say
,
I
believe
,
that
he
has
brought
himself
to
entertain
a
regard
for
me
,
and
an
interest
in
my
visits
;
feelings
which
I
am
certain
he
would
extend
to
Master
Humphrey
's
Clock
if
he
were
once
tempted
to
join
us
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
wish
you
to
understand
is
,
that
he
is
a
strange
,
secluded
visionary
,
in
the
world
but
not
of
it
;
and
as
unlike
anybody
here
as
he
is
unlike
anybody
elsewhere
that
I
have
ever
met
or
known
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Miles
received
this
account
of
our
proposed
companion
with
rather
a
wry
face
,
and
after
murmuring
that
perhaps
he
was
a
little
mad
,
inquired
if
he
were
rich
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
asked
him
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
know
,
sir
,
for
all
that
,
"
retorted
Mr
Miles
,
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
so
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
no
less
sharply
than
the
other
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
"
he
added
,
relapsing
into
his
usual
mildness
,
"
I
have
no
means
of
judging
.
 
<EOS>
He
lives
poorly
,
but
that
would
seem
to
be
in
keeping
with
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
him
allude
to
his
circumstances
,
and
never
fell
into
the
society
of
any
man
who
had
the
slightest
acquaintance
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
really
told
you
all
I
know
about
him
,
and
it
rests
with
you
to
say
whether
you
wish
to
know
more
,
or
know
quite
enough
already
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
were
unanimously
of
opinion
that
we
would
seek
to
know
more
;
and
as
a
sort
of
compromise
with
Mr
Miles
(
who
,
although
he
said
"
Yes
---
O
certainly
---
he
should
like
to
know
more
about
the
gentleman
---
he
had
no
right
to
put
himself
in
opposition
to
the
general
wish
,
"
and
so
forth
,
shook
his
head
doubtfully
and
hemmed
several
times
with
peculiar
gravity
)
,
it
was
arranged
that
Mr
Pickwick
should
carry
me
with
him
on
an
evening
visit
to
the
subject
of
our
discussion
,
for
which
purpose
an
early
appointment
between
that
gentleman
and
myself
was
immediately
agreed
upon
;
it
being
understood
that
I
was
to
act
upon
my
own
responsibility
,
and
to
invite
him
to
join
us
or
not
,
as
I
might
think
proper
.
 
<EOS>
This
solemn
question
determined
,
we
returned
to
the
clock
-
case
(
where
we
have
been
forestalled
by
the
reader
)
,
and
between
its
contents
,
and
the
conversation
they
occasioned
,
the
remainder
of
our
time
passed
very
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
broke
up
,
Mr
Pickwick
took
me
aside
to
tell
me
that
he
had
spent
a
most
charming
and
delightful
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Having
made
this
communication
with
an
air
of
the
strictest
secrecy
,
he
took
Jack
Redburn
into
another
corner
to
tell
him
the
same
,
and
then
retired
into
another
corner
with
the
deaf
gentleman
and
the
slate
,
to
repeat
the
assurance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
amusing
to
observe
the
contest
in
his
mind
whether
he
should
extend
his
confidence
to
Mr
Miles
,
or
treat
him
with
dignified
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
times
he
stepped
up
behind
him
with
a
friendly
air
,
and
as
often
stepped
back
again
without
saying
a
word
;
at
last
,
when
he
was
close
at
that
gentleman
's
ear
and
upon
the
very
point
of
whispering
something
conciliating
and
agreeable
,
Mr
Miles
happened
suddenly
to
turn
his
head
,
upon
which
Mr
Pickwick
skipped
away
,
and
said
with
some
fierceness
,
"
Good
night
,
sir
---
I
was
about
to
say
good
night
,
sir
,
---
nothing
more
;
"
and
so
made
a
bow
and
left
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sam
,
"
said
Mr
Pickwick
,
when
he
had
got
down
-
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
hard
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Right
arm

---
now
the
left
---
now
one
strong
conwulsion
,
and
the
great-
coat
's
on

sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
acted
upon
these
directions
,
and
being
further
assisted
by
Sam
,
who
pulled
at
one
side
of
the
collar
,
and
Mr
Weller
,
who
pulled
hard
at
the
other
,
was
speedily
enrobed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
senior
,
then
produced
a
full
-
sized
stable
lantern
,
which
he
had
carefully
deposited
in
a
remote
corner
,
on
his
arrival
,
and
inquired
whether
Mr
Pickwick
would
have
"
the
lamps
alight
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
to
-
night

"
said
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
if

rejoined
Mr
Weller
,
"
we

<EOS>
This

said
Mr
Weller
,
handing
it
to
the
housekeeper

Bill

makes

no

he
goes
avay
into

there
he
soon

<EOS>
The
housekeeper
graciously
promised
to
keep
the
object
of
Mr
Weller
's
regard
in
the
safest
possible
custody
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
a
laughing
face

took
his
leave

The
bodyguard
followed
,
side
by
side
;
old
Mr

buttoned
and
wrapped
up
from
his
boots
to
his
chin
;
and
Sam
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hat
half
off
his
head
,
remonstrating
with
his
father
,
as
he
went
,
on
his
extreme
loquacity
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
not
a
little
surprised
,
on
turning
to
go
up
-
stairs
,
to
encounter
the
barber
in
the
passage
at
that
late
hour
;
for
his
attendance
is
usually
confined
to
some
half
-
hour
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
Redburn
,
who
finds
out
(
by
instinct
,
I
think
)
<EOS>
everything
that
happens
in
the
house
,
informed
me
with
great
glee
,
that
a
society
in
imitation
of
our
own
had
been
that
night
formed
in
the
kitchen
,
under
the
title
of
"
Mr
Weller
's
Watch
,
"
of
which
the
barber
was
a
member
;
and
that
he
could
pledge
himself
to
find
means
of
making
me
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
its
future
proceedings
,
which
I
begged
him
,
both
on
my
own
account
and
that
of
my
readers
,
by
no
means
to
neglect
doing
.
     
<EOS>
V
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
's
watch
 
<EOS>
It
seems
that
the
housekeeper
and
the
two
Mr
Wellers
were
no
sooner
left
together
on
the
occasion
of
their
first
becoming
acquainted
,
than
the
housekeeper
called
to
her
assistance
Mr
Slithers
the
barber
,
who
had
been
lurking
in
the
kitchen
in
expectation
of
her
summons
;
and
with
many
smiles
and
much
sweetness
introduced
him
as
one
who
would
assist
her
in
the
responsible
office
of
entertaining
her
distinguished
visitors
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
she
,
"
without
Mr
Slithers
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
placed
in

an
awkward
situation

<EOS>
"
There
is
no
call

any
hock'erdness

said
Mr
Weller
with
the
utmost
politeness
;
"
no

<EOS>
A
lady

added
the
old
gentleman

looking
about
him
with
the
air
of
one
who
establishes
an
incontrovertible
position

The
housekeeper
inclined
her
head
and
smiled
yet
more
sweetly
.
 
<EOS>
The
barber
,
who
had
been
fluttering
about
Mr
Weller
and
Sam
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
to
improve
their
acquaintance
,
rubbed
his
hands
and
cried
,
"
Hear

<EOS>
Very
true
,
sir

"
whereupon
Sam
turned
about
and
steadily
regarded
him
for
some
seconds
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew

"
said
Sam
,
fixing
his
eyes
in
a
ruminative
manner
upon
the
blushing
barber

Mr

Jinkinson

begun
that
wery

kept

This
anecdote
produced
an
extraordinary
effect
,
not
only
upon
Mr
Slithers
,
but
upon
the
housekeeper
also
,
who
evinced
so
much
anxiety
to
please
and
be
pleased
,
that
Mr
Weller
,
with
a
manner
betokening
some
alarm
,
conveyed
a
whispered
inquiry
to
his
son
whether
he
had
gone
"
too
fur

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
do

demanded

"
In

"

said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
More
unlikelier
things
have
come
to

"
replied
Mr
Weller
in
a
hoarse
whisper
;
"
I
'm
always
afeerd
of

captiwation

Sammy

If

rayther
than

here
state
of
perpetival
terror

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
had
,
at
that
time
,
no
further
opportunity
of
dwelling
upon
the
apprehensions
which
beset
his
mind
,
for
the
immediate
occasion
of
his
fears
proceeded
to
lead
the
way
down
-
stairs
,
apologising
as
they
went
for
conducting
him
into
the
kitchen
,
which
apartment
,
however
,
she
was
induced
to
proffer
for
his
accommodation
in
preference
to
her
own
little
room
,
<EOS>
the
rather
as
it
afforded
greater
facilities
for
smoking
,
and
was
immediately
adjoining
the
ale
-
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparations
which
were
already
made
sufficiently
proved
that
these
were
not
mere
words
of
course
,
for
on
the
deal
table
were
a
sturdy
ale
-
jug
and
glasses
,
flanked
with
clean
pipes
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
tobacco
for
the
old
gentleman
and
his
son
,
while
on
a
dresser
hard
by
was
goodly
store
of
cold
meat
and
other
eatables
.
 
<EOS>
At
sight
of
these
arrangements
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
was
at
first
distracted
between
his
love
of
joviality
and
his
doubts
whether
they
were
not
to
be
considered
as
so
many
evidences
of
captivation
having
already
taken
place
;
but
he
soon
yielded
to
his
natural
impulse
,
and
took
his
seat
at
the
table
with
a
very
jolly
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
to
imbibin
'
any
o
'
this
here
flagrant
veed
,
mum
,
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
taking
up
a
pipe
and
laying
it
down
again
,
"
it
could
n't
be
.
 
<EOS>
Samivel
,
total
abstinence
,
if
YOU
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
like
it
of
all
things
,
"
said
the
housekeeper
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Weller
,
shaking
his
head
,
---
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
,
"
said
the
housekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Slithers
knows
I
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
coughed
,
and
notwithstanding
the
barber
's
confirmation
of
the
statement
,
said
"
No
"
again
,
but
more
feebly
than
before
.
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
lighted
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
insisted
on
applying
it
to
the
bowl
of
the
pipe
with
her
own
fair
hands
<EOS>
;
Mr
Weller
resisted
;
the
housekeeper
cried
that
her
fingers
would
be
burnt
;
Mr
Weller
gave
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
pipe
was
ignited
,
Mr
Weller
drew
a
long
puff
of
smoke
,
and
detecting
himself
in
the
very
act
of
smiling
on
the
housekeeper
,
put
a
sudden
constraint
upon
his
countenance
and
looked
sternly
at
the
candle
,
with
a
determination
not
to
captivate
,
himself
,
or
encourage
thoughts
of
captivation
in
others
.
<EOS>
From
this
iron
frame
of
mind
he
was
roused
by
the
voice
of
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
,
"
said
Sam
,
who
was
smoking
with
great
composure
and
enjoyment
,
"
that
if
the
lady
wos
agreeable
it
'
ud
be
wery
far
out
<EOS>
o
'
the
vay
for
us
four
to
make
up
a
club
of
our
own
like
the
governors
does
up

stairs
,
and
let
him
<EOS>
,
"
Sam
pointed
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
towards
his
parent
,
"
be
the
president
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
affably
declared
that
it
was
the
very
thing
she
had
been
thinking
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
barber
said
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
said
nothing
,
but
he
laid
down
his
pipe
as
if
in
a
fit
of
inspiration
,
and
performed
the
following
manoeuvres
.
   
<EOS>
Unbuttoning
the
three
lower
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
and
pausing
for
a
moment
to
enjoy
the
easy
flow
of
breath
consequent
upon
this
process
,
he
laid
violent
hands
upon
his
watch
-
chain
,
and
slowly
and
with
extreme
difficulty
drew
from
his
fob
an
immense
double
-
cased
silver
watch
,
which
brought
the
lining
of
the
pocket
with
it
,
and
was
not
to
be
disentangled
but
by
great
exertions
and
an
amazing
redness
of
face
.
 
<EOS>
Having
fairly
got
it
out
at
last
,
he
detached
the
outer
case
and
wound
it
up
with
a
key
of
corresponding
magnitude
;
then
put
the
case
on
again
,
and
having
applied
the
watch
to
his
ear
to
ascertain
that
it
was
still
going
,
gave
it
some
half
-
dozen
hard
knocks
on
the
table
to
improve
its
performance
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
laying
it
on
the
table
with
its
face
upwards
,
"
is
the
title
and
emblem
<EOS>
o

<EOS>

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
By
way
of
enforcing
this
proclamation
,
Mr
Weller
,
using
the
watch
after
the
manner
of
a
president
's
hammer
,
and
remarking
with
great
pride
that
nothing
hurt
it
,
and
that
falls
and
concussions
of
all
kinds
materially
enhanced
the
excellence
of
the
works
and
assisted
the
regulator
,
knocked
the
table
a
great
many
times
,
and
declared
the
association
formally
constituted
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
do
n't
let

have
no
grinnin

at

said
Mr
Weller
to
his
son
,
"

Merrikins
call

and
the
English
a

"
   
<EOS>
Having
uttered
this
friendly
caution
,
the
President
settled
himself
in
his
chair
with
great
dignity
,
and
requested
that
Mr
Samuel
would
relate
an
anecdote
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
told
one

"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wery

returned
the
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
wos
a
talking
jist
now

"
said
Sam
,
turning
to
Slithers
,
"
about
barbers
.
 
<EOS>
Pursuing
that
'

fruitful
theme
,
sir

I
'll
tell

in
a
wery
few
words
a

little
story

<EOS>
you
may
never

heerd

"
   
<EOS>
"
Samivel

said
Mr
Weller
,
again
bringing
his
watch
and
the
table
into
smart
collision
,
"
address
your
obserwations

cheer

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
I
might
rise
to
order
,
"
said
the
barber
in
a
soft
voice
,
and
looking
round
him
with
a
conciliatory
smile
as
he
leant
over
the
table
,
with
the
knuckles
of
his
left
hand
resting
upon
it
,
---
"
if
I
MIGHT
rise
to
order
,
I
would
suggest
that
"
barbers

not
exactly
the

language
which
is
agreeable
and
soothing
to
our
feelings

<EOS>
You

will
correct

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well

suggested
Sam

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wy

returned
his

<EOS>
"
In

vay

<EOS>
It
is
a
common
remark
,
confirmed
by
history
and
experience
,
that
great
men
rise
with
the
circumstances
in
which
they
are
placed
.
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
came
out
so
strong
in
his
capacity
of
chairman
,
that
Sam
was
for
some
time
prevented
from
speaking
by
a
grin
of
surprise
,
which
held
his
faculties
enchained
,
and
at
last
subsided
in
a
long
whistle
of
a
single
note
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
old
gentleman
appeared
even
to
have
astonished
himself
,
and
that
to
no
small
extent
,
as
was
demonstrated
by
the
vast
amount
of
chuckling
in
which
he
indulged
,
after
the
utterance
of
these
lucid
remarks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
story
,
"
said
Sam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vunce
upon
a
time
there
wos
a
young
hairdresser
as
opened
a
wery
smart
little

the

large

their

they
had
the
adwantage
over

gen'lmen

as
was

wery

terminated
rayther
abrupt

Then

Sam
interchanged

The

<EOS>
she
was

The

she
expressed
herself
agreeable

shortly
artervards
vent

The
hairdresser
rushes
out
to

d'rectly
she
sees
the
dummies
she
changes
colour
and
falls
a
tremblin

Vith

It
took
a

to

dresser

and
some
people
say
arter
all
that
it
was
more

caused

it
was
a

came

mixing

"
   
<EOS>
The
barber
declared
that
Mr
Weller
had
related
one
of
the
most
interesting
stories
that
had
ever
come
within
his
knowledge
,
in
which
opinion
the
housekeeper
entirely
concurred
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
married
man
,
sir
?
"
inquired
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
The
barber
replied
that
he
had
not
that
honour
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
s'pose
you
mean
to
be
?
"
said
Sam
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well

"
replied
the
barber
,
rubbing
his
hands
smirkingly
,
"
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
think
it
's
very
likely
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
bad
sign
,
"
said
Sam
;
"
if
you
'd
said
you
meant
to
be
vun
<EOS>
o

these

I
should

looked

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not

of
any
danger
,
at

"
returned
the
barber
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
more
wos
I
,

,

said
the
elder
Mr

,
interposing
;

<EOS>
Keep

my

"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
very
solemn
about
this
admonition
,
both
in
its
matter
and
manner
,
and
also
in
the
way
in
which
Mr
Weller
still
kept
his
eye
fixed
upon
the
unsuspecting
victim
,
that
nobody
cared
to
speak
for
some
little
time
,
and
might
not
have
cared
to
do
so
for
some
time
longer
,
if
the
housekeeper
had
not
happened
to
sigh
,
which
called
off
the
old
gentleman
's
attention
and
gave
rise
to
a
gallant
inquiry
whether
"
there
wos
anythin
'
wery
piercin
'
in
that
'
ere
little
heart
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Mr
Weller
!
"
said
the
housekeeper
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
but
is
there
anythin
'
as
agitates
it
?
"
pursued
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
it
always
been
obderrate
,
always
opposed
to
the
happiness
o
'
human
creeturs
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
Has
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
critical
juncture
for
her
blushes
and
confusion
,
the
housekeeper
discovered
that
more
ale
was
wanted
,
and
hastily
withdrew
into
the
cellar
to
draw
the
same
,
followed
by
the
barber
,
who
insisted
on
carrying
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
Having
looked
after
her
with
a
very
complacent
expression
of
face
,
and
after
him
with
some
disdain
,
Mr
Weller
caused
his
glance
to
travel
slowly
round
the
kitchen
,
until
at
length
it
rested
on
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sammy
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
I
mistrust
that
barber
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
for

"
returned
Sam
;
"
wot
's
he
got
to
do
with

<EOS>
You

and

.
"
   
<EOS>
The
imputation
of
gallantry
appeared
to
afford
Mr
Weller
the
utmost
delight
,
for
he
replied
in
a
voice
choked
by
suppressed
laughter
,
and
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
,
   
"
Wos

VI
 
Master
Humphrey
,
from
his
clock
-
side
in
the
chimney
corner
 
Two
or
three
evenings
after
the
institution
of
Mr
Weller
's
Watch
<EOS>
,
I
thought
I
heard
,
as
I
walked
in
the
garden
,
the
voice
of
Mr
Weller
himself
at
no
great
distance
;
and
stopping
once
or
twice
to
listen
more
attentively
,
I
found
that
the
sounds
proceeded
from
my
housekeeper
's
little
sitting
-
room
,
which
is
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
no
further
notice
of
the
circumstance
at
that
time
,
but
it
formed
the
subject
of
a
conversation
between
me
and
my
friend
Jack
Redburn
next
morning
,
when
I
found
that
I
had
not
been
deceived
in
my
impression
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
furnished
me
with
the
following
particulars
;
and
as
he
appeared
to
take
extraordinary
pleasure
in
relating
them
,
I
have
begged
him
in
future
to
jot
down
any
such
domestic
scenes
or
occurrences
that
may
please
his
humour
,
in
order
that
they
may
be
told
in
his
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
confess
that
,
as
Mr
Pickwick
and
he
are
constantly
together
,
I
have
been
influenced
,
in
making
this
request
,
by
a
secret
desire
to
know
something
of
their
proceedings
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
evening
in
question
,
the
housekeeper
's
room
was
arranged
with
particular
care
,
and
the
housekeeper
herself
was
very
smartly
dressed
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparations
,
however
,
were
not
confined
to
mere
showy
demonstrations
,
as
tea
was
prepared
for
three
persons
,
with
a
small
display
of
preserves
and
jams
and
sweet
cakes
,
which
heralded
some
uncommon
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Benton
(
my
housekeeper
bears
that
name
)
was
in
a
state
of
great
expectation
,
too
,
frequently
going
to
the
front
door
and
looking
anxiously
down
the
lane
,
and
more
than
once
observing
to
the
servant
-
girl
that
she
expected
company
,
and
hoped
no
accident
had
happened
to
delay
them
.
   
<EOS>
A
modest
ring
at
the
bell
at
length
allayed
her
fears
,
and
Miss
Benton
,
hurrying
into
her
own
room
and
shutting
herself
up
,
in
order
that
she
might
preserve
that
appearance
of
being
taken
by
surprise
which
is
so
essential
to
the
polite
reception
of
visitors
,
awaited
their
coming
with
a
smiling
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
ev'nin
'
,
mum
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
older
Mr
Weller
,
looking
in
at
the
door
after
a
prefatory
tap
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afeerd
we
've
come
in
rayther
arter
the
time
,
mum
,
but
<EOS>
the
young
colt
being
full
o
'
wice
,
has
been
"
a
boltin
'
and
shyin
'
and
gettin
'
his
leg
over
the
traces
to
sich
a
extent
that
if
he
an't
wery
soon
broke
in
,
he
'll
wex
me
into
a
broken
heart
,
and
then
he
'll
never
be
brought
out
no
more
except
to
learn
his
letters
from
the
writin
'
on
his
grandfather
's
tombstone
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
pathetic
words
,
which
were
addressed
to
something
outside
the
door
about
two
feet
six
from
the
ground
,
Mr
Weller
introduced
a
very
small
boy
firmly
set
upon
a
couple
of
very
sturdy
legs
,
who
looked
as
if
nothing
could
ever
knock
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
having
a
very
round
face
strongly
resembling
Mr
Weller
's
,
and
a
stout
little
body
of
exactly
his
build
,
this
young
gentleman
,
standing
with
his
little
legs
very
wide
apart
,
as
if
the
top
-
boots
were
familiar
to
them
,
actually
winked
upon
the
housekeeper
with
his
infant
eye
,
in
imitation
of
his
grandfather
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
naughty
boy
,
mum
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
bursting
with
delight
,
"
there
's
a
immoral
Tony
.
 
<EOS>
Wos
there
<EOS>
ever
a
little
chap
<EOS>
o
'
four
year
and
eight
months
old
as
vinked
his
eye
at
a
strange
lady
afore
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
little
affected
by
this
observation
as
by
the
former
appeal
to
his
feelings
,
Master
Weller
elevated
in
the
air
a
small
model
of
a
coach
whip
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
,
and
addressing
the
housekeeper
with
a
shrill
"
ya
---
hip
!
"
<EOS>
inquired
if
she
was
"
going
down
the
road
;
"
at
which
happy
adaptation
of
a
lesson
he
had
been
taught
from
infancy
,
Mr
Weller
could
restrain
his
feelings
no
longer
,
but
gave
him
twopence
on
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
in
wain
to
deny
it
,
mum
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
this
<EOS>
here
is
a
boy
arter
his
grandfather
's
own
heart
,
and
beats
out
all
the
boys
as
ever
wos
or
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
Though
at
the
same
time
,
mum
,
"
added
Mr
Weller
,
trying
to
look
gravely
down
upon
his
favourite
,
"
it
was
wery
wrong
on
him
to
want
to
---
over
all
the
posts
as
we
come
along
,
and
wery
cruel
on
him
to
force
poor
grandfather
to
lift
him
cross-
legged
over
every
vun
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
n't
pass
vun
single
blessed
post
,
mum
,
and
at
the
top
o
'
the
lane
there
's

forty

in
a
row

wery

<EOS>
Here
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
,
whose
feelings
were
in
a
perpetual
conflict
between
pride
in
his
grandson
's
achievements
and
a
sense
of
his
own
responsibility
,
and
the
importance
of
impressing
him
with
moral
truths
,
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
and
suddenly
checking
himself
,
remarked
in
a
severe
tone
that
little
boys
as
made
their
grandfathers
put
'em
over
posts
never
went
to
heaven
at
any
price
.
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
housekeeper
had
made
tea
,
and
little
Tony
,
placed
on
a
chair
beside
her
,
with
his
eyes
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
table
,
was
provided
with
various
delicacies
which
yielded
him
extreme
contentment
.
 
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
(
who
seemed
rather
afraid
of
the
child
,
notwithstanding
her
caresses
)
then
patted
him
on
the
head
,
and
declared
that
he
was
the
finest
boy
she
had
ever
seen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wy
,

said
Mr
Weller
,
"
I
do
n't

you
'll

and
that
's
the
truth

<EOS>
But

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
word
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
said
the
housekeeper
,
blushing
slightly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Petticuts
,
mum
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
garments
of
his
grandson
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
my
son
Samivel
,

vould

pense

you
'd

alteration

"
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
would
you
have
the
child
wear
instead
,
Mr
Weller
?
"
said
the
housekeeper
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
offered
my
son
Samivel
,
mum
,
agen
and

"
returned
the
old
gentleman
,
"
to
purwide
him
at
my
own
cost
vith
<EOS>
a
suit
o
'
clothes
as
'
ud
be
the
makin
'
on
him
,
and
form
his
mind
in
infancy
for
those
pursuits
as
I
hope
the
family
o
'
<EOS>
the
Vellers
vill
alvays
dewote
themselves
to
.
 
<EOS>
Tony
,
my
boy
,
tell
the
lady
wot
them
<EOS>
clothes
are
,
as
grandfather
says
,
father
ought
to
let
you
vear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
white
hat
and
a
little
sprig
weskut
and
little
knee
cords
and
little
top
-
boots
and
a
little
green
coat
with
little
bright
buttons
and
a
little
welwet
collar
,
"
replied
Tony
,
with
great
readiness
and
no
stops
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
cos
-
toom
,
mum
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
looking
proudly
at
the
housekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Once
make
sich
a
model
on
him
as
that
,
and
you
'd
say
he
WOS
an
angel
!
"
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
housekeeper
thought
that
in
such
a
guise
young
Tony
would
look
more
like
the
angel
at
Islington
than
anything
else
of
that
name
,
or
perhaps
she
was
disconcerted
to
find
her
previously-
<EOS>
conceived
ideas
disturbed
,
as
angels
are
not
commonly
represented
in
top
-
boots
and
sprig
waistcoats
.
 
<EOS>
She
coughed
doubtfully
,
but
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
many
brothers
and
sisters
have
you
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
after
a
short
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
brother
and
no
sister
at
all
,
"
replied
Tony
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sam
his
name
is
,
and
so
's
my
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
my
father
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
yes
,
I
know
him
,
"
said
the
housekeeper
,
graciously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
my
father
fond
of
you
?
"
pursued
Tony
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
rejoined
the
smiling
housekeeper
.
   
<EOS>
Tony
considered
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
"
Is
my
grandfather
fond
of
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
would
seem
a
very
easy
question
to
answer
,
but
instead
of
replying
to
it
,
the
housekeeper
smiled
in
great
confusion
,
and
said
that
really
children
did
ask
such
extraordinary
questions
that
it
was
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
talk
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Weller
took
upon
himself
to
reply
that
he
was
very
fond
of
the
lady
;
but
the
housekeeper
entreating
that
he
would
not
put
such
things
into
the
child
's
head
,
Mr
Weller
shook
his
own
while
she
looked
another
way
,
and
seemed
to
be
troubled
with
a
misgiving
that
captivation
was
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
perhaps
,
on
this
account
that
he
changed
the
subject
precipitately
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
wery
wrong
in
little
boys
to
make
game
o
'
<EOS>
their
grandfathers
,
an't
it
,
mum
?
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
shaking
his
head
waggishly
,
until
Tony
looked
at
him
,
when
he
counterfeited
the
deepest
dejection
and
sorrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
very
sad
!
"
assented
the
housekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
no
little
boys
do
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
vun
young
Turk
,
mum
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
,
"
as
havin'
seen
his
grandfather
a
little
overcome
vith
drink
on
the
occasion
of
a
friend
's
birthday

goes
a
reelin

about

's
the
old

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
quite
shocking
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
housekeeper
,
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
mum
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
;
"
and
previously
to
so
doin'
,
this
here
young
traitor
that
I
'm
a
speakin

of
<EOS>
,
pinches
his
little
nose
to
make
it
red
,
and
then
he
gives
a
hiccup
and
says
,
"
I
'm
all
right

"
he
says
;
"
give

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
"
Give

he
says
.
 
<EOS>
Ha

ha

ha

"
   
<EOS>
In
his
excessive
delight
,
Mr
Weller
was
quite
unmindful
of
his
moral
responsibility
,
until
little
Tony
kicked
up
his
legs
,
and
laughing
immoderately
,
cried
,
"
That
was
me
,
that
was
;
"
whereupon
the
grandfather
,
by
a
great
effort
,
became
extremely
solemn
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Tony
,
not
you
,
"
said
Mr
Weller
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
warn't

<EOS>
It
must

been

out

that

standing
on

afore

looking

pretending
to
shave

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He

I

"
observed
the
housekeeper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
he
,
mum

"
said
Mr
Weller
proudly
;
"

---
but
suddenly
recollecting
himself
and
observing
that
Tony
perfectly
understood
and
appreciated
the
compliment
,
the
old
gentleman
groaned
and
observed
that
"

wery

<EOS>

He

even
gone

far

of

spectacles
as

his

to

for

Tony
.
   
<EOS>
"
He

he
does

said
Mr

.
 
<EOS>
"
He
knows

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Always
good

"
echoed
Tony
;
and
his
grandfather
immediately
took
him
on
his
knee
and
kissed
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
many
nods
and
winks
,
slyly
pointing
at
the
child
's
head
with
his
thumb
,
in
order
that
the
housekeeper
,
otherwise
deceived
by
the
admirable
manner
in
which
he
(
Mr
Weller
)
had
sustained
his
character
,
might
not
suppose
that
any
other
young
gentleman
was
referred
to
,
and
might
clearly
understand
that
the
boy
of
the
watch
-
box
was
but
an
imaginary
creation
,
and
a
fetch
of
Tony
himself
,
invented
for
his
improvement
and
reformation
.
   
<EOS>
Not
confining
himself
to
a
mere
verbal
description
of
his
grandson
's
abilities
,
Mr
Weller
,
when
tea
was
finished
,
invited
him
by
various
gifts
of
pence
and
halfpence
to
smoke
imaginary
pipes
,
drink
visionary
beer
from
real
pots
,
imitate
his
grandfather
without
reserve
,
and
in
particular
to
go
through
the
drunken
scene
,
which
threw
the
old
gentleman
into
ecstasies
and
filled
the
housekeeper
with
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
Mr
Weller
's
pride
satisfied
with
even
this
display
,
for
when
he
took
his
leave
he
carried
the
child
,
like
some
rare
and
astonishing
curiosity
,
first
to
the
barber
's
house
and
afterwards
to
the
tobacconist
's
,
at
each
of
which
places
<EOS>
he
repeated
his
performances
with
the
utmost
effect
to
applauding
and
delighted
audiences
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
half
-
past
nine
o'clock
when
Mr
Weller
was
last
seen
carrying
him
home
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
it
has
been
whispered
abroad
that
at
that
time
the
infant
Tony
was
rather
intoxicated
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
musing
the
other
evening
upon
the
characters
and
incidents
with
which
I
had
been
so
long
engaged
;
wondering
how
I
could
ever
have
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
completion
of
my
tale
,
and
reproaching
myself
for
having
done
so
,
as
if
it
were
a
kind
of
cruelty
to
those
companions
of
my
solitude
whom
I
had
now
dismissed
,
and
could
never
again
recall
;
when
my
clock
struck
ten
.
<EOS>
Punctual
to
the
hour
,
my
friends
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
On
our
last
night
of
meeting
,
we
had
finished
the
story
which
the
reader
has
just
concluded
.
 
<EOS>
Our
conversation
took
the
same
current
as
the
meditations
which
the
entrance
of
my
friends
had
interrupted
,
and
The
Old
Curiosity
Shop
was
the
staple
of
our
discourse
.
   
<EOS>
I
may
confide
to
the
reader
now
,
that
in
connection
with
this
little
history
I
had
something
upon
my
mind
;
something
to
communicate
which
I
had
all
along
with
difficulty
repressed
;
something
I
had
deemed
it
,
during
the
progress
of
the
story
,
necessary
to
its
interest
to
disguise
,
and
which
,
now
that
it
was
over
,
I
wished
,
and
was
yet
reluctant
,
to
disclose
.
   
<EOS>
To
conceal
anything
from
those
to
whom
I
am
attached
,
is
not
in
my
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
never
close
my
lips
where
I
have
opened
my
heart
.
<EOS>
This
temper
,
and
the
consciousness
of
having
done
some
violence
to
it
in
my
narrative
,
laid
me
under
a
restraint
which
I
should
have
had
great
difficulty
in
overcoming
,
but
for
a
timely
remark
from
Mr
Miles
,
who
,
as
I
hinted
in
a
former
paper
,
is
a
gentleman
of
business
habits
,
and
of
great
exactness
and
propriety
in
all
his
transactions
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
wished
,
"
my
friend
objected
,
"
that
we
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
single
gentleman
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
his
withholding
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
me
look
upon
him
at
first
with
suspicion
,
and
caused
me
to
doubt
his
moral
character
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
fully
satisfied
by
this
time
of
his
being
a
worthy
creature
;
but
in
this
respect
he
certainly
would
not
appear
to
have
acted
at
all
like
a
man
of
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
friends
,
"
said
I
,
drawing
to
the
table
,
at
which
they
were
by
this
time
seated
in
their
usual
chairs
,
"
do
you
remember
that
this
story
bore
another
title
besides
that
one
we
have
so
often
heard
of
late
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Miles
had
his
pocket
-
book
out
in
an
instant
,
and
referring
to
an
entry
therein
,
rejoined
,
"
Certainly
.
 
<EOS>
Personal
Adventures
of
Master
Humphrey
.
 
<EOS>
Here
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
note
of
it
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
resume
what
I
had
to
tell
them
,
when
the
same
Mr
Miles
again
interrupted
me
,
observing
that
the
narrative
originated
in
a
personal
adventure
of
my
own
,
and
that
was
no
doubt
the
reason
for
its
being
thus
designated
.
   
<EOS>
This
led
me
to
the
point
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
one
and
all
forgive
me
,
"
I
returned
,
"
if
for
the
greater
convenience
of
the
story
,
and
for
its
better
introduction
,
that
adventure
was
fictitious
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
my
share
,
indeed
,
---
no
light
or
trivial
one
,
---
in
the
pages
we
have
read
,
but
it
was
not
the
share
I
feigned
to
have
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
The
younger
brother
,
the
single
gentleman
,
the
nameless
actor
in
this
little
drama
,
stands
before
you
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
see
they
had
not
expected
this
disclosure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
pursued
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
look
back
upon
my
part
in
it
with
a
calm
,
half
-
smiling
pity
for
myself
as
for
some
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
he
,
indeed
;
and
now
the
chief
sorrows
of
my
life
are
yours
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
need
not
say
what
true
gratification
I
derived
from
the
sympathy
and
kindness
with
which
this
acknowledgment
was
received
;
nor
how
often
it
had
risen
to
my
lips
before
;
nor
how
difficult
I
had
found
it
---
<EOS>
how
impossible
,
when
I
came
to
those
passages
which
touched
me
most
,
and
most
nearly
concerned
me
---
to
sustain
the
character
I
had
assumed
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
to
say
that
I
replaced
in
the
clock
-
case
the
record
of
so
many
trials
,
---
sorrowfully
,
it
is
true
,
but
with
a
softened
sorrow
which
was
almost
pleasure
;
and
felt
that
in
living
through
the
past
again
,
and
communicating
to
others
the
lesson
it
had
helped
to
teach
me
,
I
had
been
a
happier
man
.
   
<EOS>
We
lingered
so
long
over
the
leaves
from
which
I
had
read
,
that
as
I
consigned
them
to
their
former
resting
-
place
,
the
hand
of
my
trusty
clock
pointed
to
twelve
,
and
there
came
towards
us
upon
the
wind
the
voice
of
the
deep
and
distant
bell
of
St
Paul
's
as
it
struck
the
hour
of
midnight
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
I
,
returning
with
a
manuscript
I
had
taken
at
the
moment
,
from
the
same
repository
,
"
to
be
opened
to
such
music
,
should
be
a
tale
where
London
's
face
by
night
is
darkly
seen
,
and
where
some
deed
of
such
a
time
as
this
is
dimly
shadowed
out
.
<EOS>
Which
of
us
here
has
seen
the
working
of
that
great
machine
whose
voice
has
just
now
ceased
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
had
,
of
course
,
and
so
had
Mr
Miles
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
and
my
deaf
friend
were
in
the
minority
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
seen
it
<EOS>
but
a
few
days
before
,
and
could
not
help
telling
them
of
the
fancy
I
had
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
paid
my
fee
of
twopence
upon
entering
,
to
one
of
the
money-
changers
who
sit
within
the
Temple
;
and
falling
,
after
a
few
turns
up
and
down
,
into
the
quiet
train
of
thought
which
such
a
place
awakens
,
paced
the
echoing
stones
like
some
old
monk
whose
present
world
lay
all
within
its
walls
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
looked
afar
up
into
the
lofty
dome
,
I
could
not
help
wondering
what
were
his
reflections
whose
genius
reared
that
mighty
pile
,
when
,
the
last
small
wedge
of
timber
fixed
,
the
last
nail
driven
into
its
home
for
many
centuries
,
the
clang
of
hammers
,
and
the
hum
of
busy
voices
gone
,
and
the
Great
Silence
<EOS>
whole
years
of
noise
had
helped
to
make
,
reigning
undisturbed
around
<EOS>
,
he
mused
,
as
I
did
now
,
upon
his
work
,
and
lost
himself
amid
its
vast
extent
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
quite
determine
whether
the
contemplation
of
it
would
impress
him
with
a
sense
of
greatness
or
of
insignificance
;
but
when
I
remembered
how
long
a
time
it
had
taken
to
erect
,
in
how
short
a
space
it
might
be
traversed
even
to
its
remotest
parts
,
for
how
brief
a
term
<EOS>
he
,
or
any
of
those
who
cared
to
bear
his
name
,
would
live
to
see
it
,
or
know
of
its
existence
<EOS>
,
I
imagined
him
far
more
melancholy
than
proud
,
and
looking
with
regret
upon
his
labour
done
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
thoughts
in
my
mind
,
I
began
to
ascend
,
almost
unconsciously
,
the
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
several
wonders
of
the
building
,
and
found
myself
before
a
barrier
where
another
money
-
taker
sat
,
who
demanded
which
among
them
I
would
choose
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
stone
gallery
,
he
said
,
and
the
whispering
gallery
,
the
geometrical
staircase
,
the
room
of
models
,
the
clock
---
the
clock
being
quite
in
my
way
,
I
stopped
him
there
,
and
chose
that
sight
from
all
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
I
groped
my
way
into
the
Turret
which
it
occupies
,
and
saw
before
me
,
in
a
kind
of
loft
,
what
seemed
to
be
a
great
,
old
oaken
press
with
folding
doors
.
 
<EOS>
These
being
thrown
back
by
the
attendant
(
who
was
sleeping
when
I
came
upon
him
,
and
looked
a
drowsy
fellow
,
as
though
his
close
companionship
with
Time
had
made
him
quite
indifferent
to
it
)
,
disclosed
a
complicated
crowd
of
wheels
and
chains
in
iron
and
brass
,
---
great
,
sturdy
,
rattling
engines
,
---
suggestive
of
breaking
a
finger
put
in
here
or
there
,
and
grinding
the
bone
to
powder
,
---
and
these
were
the
Clock
!
 
<EOS>
Its
very
pulse
,
if
I
may
use
the
word
,
was
like
no
other
clock
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
not
mark
the
flight
of
every
moment
with
a
gentle
second
stroke
,
as
though
it
would
check
old
Time
,
and
have
him
stay
his
pace
in
pity
,
but
measured
it
with
one
sledge
-
hammer
beat
,
as
if
its
business
were
to
crush
the
seconds
as
they
came
trooping
on
,
and
remorselessly
to
clear
a
path
before
the
Day
of
Judgment
.
   
<EOS>
I
sat
down
opposite
to
it
,
and
hearing
its
regular
and
never-
changing
voice
,
that
one
deep
constant
note
,
uppermost
amongst
all
the
noise
and
clatter
in
the
streets
below
,
---
marking
that
,
let
that
tumult
rise
or
fall
,
go
on
or
stop
,
---
let
it
be
night
or
noon
,
to
-
morrow
or
to
-
day
,
this
year
or
next
,
<EOS>
---
it
still
performed
its
functions
with
the
same
dull
constancy
,
and
regulated
the
progress
of
the
life
around
,
the
fancy
came
upon
me
that
this
was
London
's
Heart
,
---
and
that
when
it
should
cease
to
beat
,
the
City
would
be
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
night
.
 
<EOS>
Calm
and
unmoved
amidst
the
scenes
that
darkness
favours
,
the
great
heart
of
London
throbs
in
its
Giant
breast
.
<EOS>
Wealth
and
beggary
,
vice
and
virtue
,
guilt
and
innocence
,
repletion
and
the
direst
hunger
,
all
treading
on
each
other
and
crowding
together
,
are
gathered
round
it
.
 
<EOS>
Draw
but
a
little
circle
above
the
clustering
housetops
,
and
<EOS>
you
shall
have
within
its
space
everything
,
with
its
opposite
extreme
and
contradiction
,
close
beside
.
 
<EOS>
Where
yonder
feeble
light
is
shining
,
a
man
is
but
this
moment
dead
.
 
<EOS>
The
taper
at
a
few
yards
'
distance
is
seen
by
eyes
that
have
this
instant
opened
on
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
two
houses
separated
by
but
an
inch
or
two
of
wall
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
,
there
are
quiet
minds
at
rest
;
in
the
other
,
a
waking
conscience
that
one
might
think
would
trouble
the
very
air
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
close
corner
where
the
roofs
shrink
down
and
cower
together
as
if
to
hide
their
secrets
from
the
handsome
street
hard
by
,
there
are
such
dark
crimes
,
such
miseries
and
horrors
,
as
could
be
hardly
told
in
whispers
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
handsome
street
,
there
are
folks
asleep
who
have
dwelt
there
all
their
lives
,
and
have
no
more
knowledge
of
these
things
than
if
they
had
never
been
,
or
were
transacted
at
the
remotest
limits
of
the
world
,
---
who
,
if
they
were
hinted
at
,
would
shake
their
heads
,
look
wise
,
and
frown
,
and
say
they
were
impossible
,
and
out
of
Nature
,
---
as
if
all
great
towns
were
not
.
 
<EOS>
Does
not
this
Heart
of
London
,
that
nothing
moves
,
nor
stops
,
nor
quickens
<EOS>
,
---
that
goes
on
the
same
let
what
will
be
done
,
does
it
not
express
the
City
's
character
well
?
   
<EOS>
The
day
begins
to
break
,
and
soon
there
is
the
hum
and
noise
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
have
spent
the
night
on
doorsteps
and
cold
stones
crawl
off
to
beg
;
they
who
have
slept
in
beds
come
forth
to
their
occupation
,
too
,
and
business
is
astir
.
 
<EOS>
The
fog
of
sleep
rolls
slowly
off
,
and
London
shines
awake
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
are
filled
with
carriages
and
people
gaily
clad
.
 
<EOS>
The
jails
are
full
,
too
,
to
the
throat
,
nor
have
the
workhouses
or
hospitals
much
room
to
spare
.
<EOS>
The
courts
of
law
are
crowded
.
 
<EOS>
Taverns
have
their
regular
frequenters
by
this
time
,
and
every
mart
of
traffic
has
its
throng
.
<EOS>
Each
of
these
places
is
a
world
,
and
has
its
own
inhabitants
;
each
is
distinct
from
,
and
almost
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
some
few
people
well
to
do
,
who
remember
to
have
heard
it
said
,
that
numbers
of
men
and
women
---
thousands
,
they
think
it
was
---
get
up
in
London
every
day
,
unknowing
where
to
lay
their
heads
at
night
;
and
that
there
are
quarters
of
the
town
where
misery
and
famine
always
are
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
n't
believe
it
quite
,
---
there
may
be
some
truth
in
it
,
but
it
is
exaggerated
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
each
of
these
thousand
worlds
goes
on
,
intent
upon
itself
,
until
night
comes
again
,
---
first
with
its
lights
and
pleasures
,
and
its
cheerful
streets
;
then
with
its
guilt
and
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
Heart
of
London
<EOS>
,
there
is
a
moral
in
thy
every
stroke
!
<EOS>
as
I
look
on
at
thy
indomitable
working
,
which
neither
death
,
nor
press
of
life
,
nor
grief
,
nor
gladness
out
of
doors
will
influence
one
jot
,
I
seem
to
hear
a
voice
within
thee
which
sinks
into
my
heart
,
bidding
me
,
as
I
elbow
my
way
among
the
crowd
,
have
some
thought
for
the
meanest
wretch
that
passes
,
and
,
being
a
man
,
to
turn
away
with
scorn
and
pride
from
none
that
bear
the
human
shape
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
by
no
means
sure
that
I
might
not
have
been
tempted
to
enlarge
upon
the
subject
,
had
not
the
papers
that
lay
before
me
on
the
table
been
a
silent
reproach
for
even
this
digression
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
them
up
again
when
I
had
got
thus
far
,
and
seriously
prepared
to
read
.
   
<EOS>
The
handwriting
was
strange
to
me
,
for
the
manuscript
had
been
fairly
copied
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
is
against
our
rules
,
in
such
a
case
,
to
inquire
into
the
authorship
until
the
reading
is
concluded
,
I
could
only
glance
at
the
different
faces
round
me
,
in
search
of
some
expression
which
should
betray
the
writer
.
 
<EOS>
Whoever
he
might
be
,
he
was
prepared
for
this
,
and
gave
no
sign
for
my
enlightenment
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
the
papers
in
my
hand
,
when
my
deaf
friend
interposed
with
a
suggestion
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
occurred
to
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
bearing
in
mind
your
sequel
to
the
tale
we
have
finished
,
that
if
such
of
us
as
have
anything
to
relate
of
our
own
lives
could
interweave
it
with
our
contribution
to
the
Clock
,
it
would
be
well
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
This
need
be
no
restraint
upon
us
,
either
as
to
time
,
or
place
,
or
incident
,
since
any
real
passage
of
this
kind
may
be
surrounded
by
fictitious
circumstances
,
and
represented
by
fictitious
characters
.
 
<EOS>
What
if
we
make
this
an
article
of
agreement
among
ourselves
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
proposition
was
cordially
received
,
but
the
difficulty
appeared
to
be
that
here
was
a
long
story
written
before
we
had
thought
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Unless
,
"
said
I
,
"
it
should
have
happened
that
the
writer
of
this
tale
---
which
is
not
impossible
,
for
men
are
apt
to
do
so
when
they
write
---
has
actually
mingled
with
it
something
of
his
own
endurance
and
experience
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
spoke
,
but
I
thought
I
detected
in
one
quarter
that
this
was
really
the
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
have
no
assurance
to
the
contrary
,
"
I
added
,
therefore
,
"
I
shall
take
it
for
granted
that
he
has
done
so
,
and
that
even
these
papers
come
within
our
new
agreement
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
being
mute
<EOS>
,
we
hold
that
understanding
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
here
I
was
about
to
begin
again
,
when
Jack
informed
us
softly
,
that
during
the
progress
of
our
last
narrative
,
Mr
Weller
's
Watch
had
adjourned
its
sittings
from
the
kitchen
,
and
regularly
met
outside
our
door
,
where
he
had
no
doubt
that
august
body
would
be
found
at
the
present
moment
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
was
for
the
convenience
of
listening
to
our
stories
,
he
submitted
that
they
might
be
suffered
to
come
in
,
and
hear
them
more
pleasantly
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
we
one
and
all
yielded
a
ready
assent
,
and
the
party
being
discovered
,
as
Jack
had
supposed
,
and
invited
to
walk
in
,
entered
(
though
not
without
great
confusion
at
having
been
detected
)
,
and
were
accommodated
with
chairs
at
a
little
distance
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
the
lamp
being
trimmed
,
the
fire
well
stirred
and
burning
brightly
,
the
hearth
clean
swept
,
the
curtains
closely
drawn
,
the
clock
wound
up
,
we
entered
on
our
new
story
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
again
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
My
fire
burns
cheerfully
;
the
room
is
filled
with
my
old
friend
's
sober
voice
;
and
I
am
left
to
muse
upon
the
story
we
have
just
now
finished
.
   
<EOS>
It
makes
me
smile
,
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
to
think
if
there
were
any
one
to
see
me
sitting
in
my
easy
-
chair
,
my
gray
head
hanging
down
,
my
eyes
bent
thoughtfully
upon
the
glowing
embers
,
and
my
crutch
---
emblem
of
my
helplessness
---
lying
upon
the
hearth
at
my
feet
,
how
solitary
I
should
seem
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
though
I
am
the
sole
tenant
of
this
chimney
-
corner
,
though
I
am
childless
and
old
,
I
have
no
sense
of
loneliness
at
this
hour
;
but
am
the
centre
of
a
silent
group
whose
company
I
love
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
even
age
and
weakness
have
their
consolations
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
were
a
younger
man
,
if
I
were
more
active
,
more
strongly
bound
and
tied
to
life
,
these
visionary
friends
would
shun
me
,
or
I
should
desire
to
fly
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
Being
what
I
am
,
I
can
court
their
society
,
and
delight
in
it
;
and
pass
whole
hours
in
picturing
to
myself
the
shadows
that
perchance
flock
every
night
into
this
chamber
,
and
in
imagining
with
pleasure
what
kind
of
interest
they
have
in
the
frail
,
feeble
mortal
who
is
its
sole
inhabitant
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
friends
I
have
ever
lost
<EOS>
I
find
again
among
these
visitors
.
<EOS>
I
love
to
fancy
their
spirits
hovering
about
me
,
feeling
still
some
earthly
kindness
for
their
old
companion
,
and
watching
his
decay
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
weaker
,
he
declines
apace
,
he
draws
nearer
and
nearer
to
us
,
and
will
soon
be
conscious
of
our
existence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
What
is
there
to
alarm
me
in
this
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
encouragement
and
hope
.
   
<EOS>
These
thoughts
have
never
crowded
on
me
half
so
fast
as
they
have
done
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Faces
<EOS>
I
had
long
forgotten
<EOS>
have
become
familiar
to
me
once
again
;
traits
I
had
endeavoured
to
recall
for
years
have
come
before
me
in
an
instant
;
nothing
is
changed
but
me
;
and
even
I
can
be
my
former
self
at
will
.
   
<EOS>
Raising
my
eyes
but
now
to
the
face
of
my
old
clock
,
I
remember
,
quite
involuntarily
,
the
veneration
,
not
unmixed
with
a
sort
of
childish
awe
,
with
which
I
used
to
sit
and
watch
it
as
it
ticked
,
unheeded
in
a
dark
staircase
corner
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
looking
more
grave
and
steady
when
I
met
its
dusty
face
,
as
if
,
having
that
strange
kind
of
life
within
it
,
and
being
free
from
all
excess
of
vulgar
appetite
,
and
warning
all
the
house
by
night
and
day
,
it
were
a
sage
.
 
<EOS>
How
often
have
I
listened
to
it
as
it
told
the
beads
of
time
,
and
wondered
at
its
constancy
!
 
<EOS>
How
often
watched
it
slowly
pointing
round
the
dial
,
and
,
while
I
panted
for
the
eagerly
expected
hour
to
come
,
admired
,
despite
myself
,
its
steadiness
of
purpose
and
lofty
freedom
from
all
human
strife
,
impatience
,
and
desire
!
   
<EOS>
I
thought
it
cruel
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
hard
of
heart
,
to
my
mind
,
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
servant
even
then
;
and
I
felt
as
though
it
ought
to
show
some
sorrow
;
as
though
it
wanted
sympathy
with
us
in
our
distress
,
and
were
a
dull
,
heartless
,
mercenary
creature
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
soon
I
learnt
to
know
that
in
its
ceaseless
going
on
,
and
in
its
being
checked
or
stayed
by
nothing
,
lay
its
greatest
kindness
,
and
the
only
balm
for
grief
and
wounded
peace
of
mind
.
   
<EOS>
To
-
night
,
to
-
night
,
when
this
tranquillity
and
calm
are
on
my
spirits
,
and
memory
presents
so
many
shifting
scenes
before
me
,
I
take
my
quiet
stand
at
will
by
many
a
fire
that
has
been
long
extinguished
,
and
mingle
with
the
cheerful
group
that
cluster
round
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
be
sorrowful
in
such
a
mood
,
I
should
grow
sad
to
think
what
a
poor
blot
I
was
upon
their
youth
and
beauty
once
,
and
now
how
few
remain
to
put
me
to
the
blush
;
I
should
grow
sad
to
think
that
such
among
them
as
I
sometimes
meet
with
in
my
daily
walks
are
scarcely
less
infirm
than
I
;
that
time
has
brought
us
to
a
level
;
and
that
all
distinctions
fade
and
vanish
as
we
take
our
trembling
steps
towards
the
grave
.
   
<EOS>
But
memory
was
given
us
for
better
purposes
than
this
,
and
mine
is
not
a
torment
,
but
a
source
of
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
To
muse
upon
the
gaiety
and
youth
I
have
known
suggests
to
me
glad
scenes
of
harmless
mirth
that
may
be
passing
now
.
 
<EOS>
From
contemplating
them
apart
,
I
soon
become
an
actor
in
these
little
dramas
,
and
humouring
my
fancy
,
lose
myself
among
the
beings
it
invokes
.
   
<EOS>
When
my
fire
is
bright
and
high
,
and
a
warm
blush
mantles
in
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
this
ancient
room
;
when
my
clock
makes
cheerful
music
,
like
one
of
those
chirping
insects
who
delight
in
the
warm
hearth
,
and
are
sometimes
,
by
a
good
superstition
,
looked
upon
as
the
harbingers
of
fortune
and
plenty
to
that
household
in
whose
mercies
they
put
their
humble
trust
;
when
everything
is
in
a
ruddy
genial
glow
,
and
there
are
voices
in
the
crackling
flame
,
and
smiles
in
its
flashing
light
,
other
smiles
and
other
voices
congregate
around
me
,
invading
,
with
their
pleasant
harmony
,
the
silence
of
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
For
then
a
knot
of
youthful
creatures
gather
round
my
fireside
,
and
the
room
re
-
echoes
to
their
merry
voices
.
 
<EOS>
My
solitary
chair
no
longer
holds
its
ample
place
before
the
fire
,
but
is
wheeled
into
a
smaller
corner
,
to
leave
more
room
for
the
broad
circle
formed
about
the
cheerful
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sons
,
and
daughters
,
and
grandchildren
,
and
we
are
assembled
on
some
occasion
of
rejoicing
common
to
us
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
birthday
,
perhaps
,
or
perhaps
it
may
be
Christmas
time
;
but
be
it
<EOS>
what
it
may
,
there
is
rare
holiday
among
us
;
we
are
full
of
glee
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
chimney
-
comer
,
opposite
myself
,
sits
one
who
has
grown
old
beside
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
changed
,
of
course
;
much
changed
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
recognise
the
girl
even
in
that
gray
hair
and
wrinkled
brow
.
<EOS>
Glancing
from
the
laughing
child
who
half
hides
in
her
ample
skirts
,
and
half
peeps
out
,
---
and
from
her
to
the
little
matron
of
twelve
years
old
,
who
sits
so
womanly
and
so
demure
at
no
great
distance
from
me
,
---
and
from
her
again
,
to
a
fair
girl
in
the
full
bloom
of
early
womanhood
,
the
centre
of
the
group
,
who
has
glanced
more
than
once
towards
the
opening
door
,
and
by
whom
the
children
,
whispering
and
tittering
among
themselves
,
WILL
leave
a
vacant
chair
,
although
she
bids
them
not
,
---
I
see
her
image
thrice
repeated
,
and
feel
how
long
it
is
before
one
form
and
set
of
features
wholly
pass
away
,
if
ever
,
from
among
the
living
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
am
dwelling
upon
this
,
and
tracing
out
the
gradual
change
from
infancy
to
youth
,
from
youth
to
perfect
growth
,
from
that
to
age
,
and
thinking
,
with
an
old
man
's
pride
,
that
she
is
comely
yet
,
I
feel
a
slight
thin
hand
upon
my
arm
,
and
,
looking
down
,
see
seated
at
my
feet
a
crippled
boy
,
---
a
gentle
,
patient
child
,
---
whose
aspect
I
know
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
rests
upon
a
little
crutch
,
---
<EOS>
I
know
it
too
,
---
and
leaning
on
it
as
he
climbs
my
footstool
,
whispers
in
my
ear
,
"
I
am
hardly
one
of
these
,
dear
grandfather
,
although
I
love
them
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
very
kind
to
me
,
but
you
will
be
kinder
still
,
I
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
my
hand
upon
his
neck
,
and
stoop
to
kiss
him
,
when
my
clock
strikes
,
my
chair
is
in
its
old
spot
,
and
I
am
alone
.
   
<EOS>
What
<EOS>
if
I
be
?
 
<EOS>
What
if
this
fireside
be
tenantless
,
save
for
the
presence
of
one
weak
old
man
?
 
<EOS>
From
my
house
-
top
I
can
look
upon
a
hundred
homes
,
in
every
one
of
which
these
social
companions
are
matters
of
reality
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
daily
walks
<EOS>
I
pass
a
thousand
men
whose
cares
are
all
forgotten
,
whose
labours
are
made
light
,
whose
dull
routine
of
work
from
day
to
day
is
cheered
and
brightened
by
their
glimpses
of
domestic
joy
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
the
struggles
of
this
struggling
town
what
cheerful
sacrifices
are
made
;
what
toil
endured
with
readiness
;
what
patience
shown
and
fortitude
displayed
for
the
mere
sake
of
home
and
its
affections
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
thank
Heaven
that
I
can
people
my
fireside
with
shadows
such
as
these
;
with
shadows
of
bright
objects
that
exist
in
crowds
about
me
;
and
let
me
say
,
"
I
am
alone
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
was
less
so
<EOS>
---
I
write
it
with
a
grateful
heart
---
than
I
am
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Recollections
of
the
past
and
visions
of
the
present
come
to
bear
me
company
;
the
meanest
man
to
whom
I
have
ever
given
alms
appears
,
to
add
his
mite
of
peace
and
comfort
to
my
stock
;
and
whenever
the
fire
within
me
shall
grow
cold
,
to
light
my
path
upon
this
earth
no
more
,
I
pray
that
it
may
be
at
such
an
hour
as
this
,
and
when
I
love
the
world
as
well
as
I
do
now
.
    
<EOS>
The
deaf
gentleman
from
his
own
apartment
 
<EOS>
Our
dear
friend
laid
down
his
pen
at
the
end
of
the
foregoing
paragraph
,
to
take
it
up
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
little
thought
ever
to
employ
mine
upon
so
sorrowful
a
task
as
that
which
he
has
left
me
,
and
to
which
I
now
devote
it
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
did
not
appear
among
us
at
his
usual
hour
next
morning
,
we
knocked
gently
at
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
No
answer
being
given
,
it
was
softly
opened
;
and
then
,
to
our
surprise
,
we
saw
him
seated
before
the
ashes
of
his
fire
,
with
a
little
table
<EOS>
I
was
accustomed
to
set
at
his
elbow
when
I
left
him
for
the
night
at
a
short
distance
from
him
,
as
though
he
had
pushed
it
away
with
the
idea
of
rising
and
retiring
to
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
His
crutch
and
footstool
lay
at
his
feet
as
usual
,
and
he
was
dressed
in
his
chamber
-
gown
,
which
he
had
put
on
before
I
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
reclining
in
his
chair
,
in
his
accustomed
posture
,
with
his
face
towards
the
fire
,
and
seemed
absorbed
in
meditation
,
---
indeed
,
at
first
,
we
almost
hoped
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
Going
up
to
him
,
we
found
him
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
,
very
often
,
seen
him
sleeping
,
and
always
peacefully
,
but
I
never
saw
him
look
so
calm
and
tranquil
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
wore
a
serene
,
benign
expression
,
which
had
impressed
me
very
strongly
when
we
last
shook
hands
;
not
that
he
had
ever
had
any
other
look
,
God
knows
;
but
there
was
something
in
this
so
very
spiritual
,
so
strangely
and
indefinably
allied
to
youth
,
although
his
head
was
gray
and
venerable
,
that
it
was
new
even
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
upon
me
all
at
once
when
on
some
slight
pretence
he
called
me
back
upon
the
previous
night
to
take
me
by
the
hand
again
,
and
once
more
say
,
"
God
bless
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
bell
-
rope
hung
within
his
reach
,
but
he
had
not
moved
towards
it
;
nor
had
he
stirred
,
we
all
agreed
,
except
,
as
I
have
said
,
to
push
away
his
table
,
which
he
could
have
done
,
and
no
doubt
did
,
with
a
very
slight
motion
of
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
relapsed
for
a
moment
into
his
late
train
of
meditation
,
and
,
with
a
thoughtful
smile
upon
his
face
,
had
died
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
long
known
it
to
be
his
wish
that
whenever
this
event
should
come
to
pass
we
might
be
all
assembled
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
lost
no
time
in
sending
for
Mr
Pickwick
and
for
Mr
Miles
,
both
of
whom
arrived
before
the
messenger
's
return
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
purpose
to
dilate
upon
the
sorrow
and
affectionate
emotions
of
which
I
was
at
once
the
witness
and
the
sharer
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
may
say
,
of
the
humbler
mourners
,
that
his
faithful
housekeeper
was
fairly
heart
-
broken
;
that
the
poor
barber
would
not
be
comforted
;
and
that
I
shall
respect
the
homely
truth
and
warmth
of
heart
of
Mr
Weller
and
his
son
to
the
last
moment
of
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
sweet
old
creetur
,
sir
,
"
said
the
elder
Mr
Weller
to
me
in
the
afternoon
,
"
has
bolted
.
 
<EOS>
Him
as
had
no
wice
,
and
was
so
free
from
temper
that
a
infant
might
ha
"
drove
him
,
has
been
took
at
last
with
that
'
ere
unawoidable
fit
o
'
staggers
as
we
all
must
come
to
,
and
gone
off
his
feed
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
with
a
moisture
in
his
eye
,
which
could
not
be
mistaken
,
---
"
<EOS>
I
see
him
gettin
'
,
every
journey
,
more
and
more
groggy
;
I
says
to
Samivel
,
"
<EOS>
My
boy
!
<EOS>
the
Grey
's
a
-
goin
'
at
the
knees
;
"
and
now
my
predilictions
is
fatally
werified
,
and
him
as
I
could
never
do
enough
to
serve
or
show
my
likin
'
for
,
is
up
the
great
uniwersal
spout
o
'
natur
'
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
not
the
less
sensible
of
the
old
man
's
attachment
because
he
expressed
it
in
his
peculiar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
can
truly
assert
of
both
him
and
his
son
,
that
notwithstanding
the
extraordinary
dialogues
they
held
together
,
and
the
strange
commentaries
and
corrections
with
which
each
of
them
illustrated
the
other
's
speech
,
I
do
not
think
it
possible
to
exceed
the
sincerity
of
their
regret
;
and
that
I
am
sure
their
thoughtfulness
and
anxiety
in
anticipating
the
discharge
of
many
little
offices
of
sympathy
would
have
done
honour
to
the
most
delicate
-
minded
persons
.
   
<EOS>
Our
friend
had
frequently
told
us
that
his
will
would
be
found
in
a
box
in
the
Clock
-
case
,
the
key
of
which
was
in
his
writing
-
desk
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
told
us
also
that
he
desired
it
to
be
opened
immediately
after
his
death
,
whenever
that
should
happen
,
we
met
together
that
night
for
the
fulfilment
of
his
request
.
   
<EOS>
We
found
it
where
he
had
told
us
,
wrapped
in
a
sealed
paper
,
and
with
it
a
codicil
of
recent
date
,
in
which
he
named
Mr
Miles
and
Mr
Pickwick
his
executors
,
---
as
having
no
need
of
any
greater
benefit
from
his
estate
than
a
generous
token
(
which
he
bequeathed
to
them
)
of
his
friendship
and
remembrance
.
   
<EOS>
After
pointing
out
the
spot
in
which
he
wished
his
ashes
to
repose
,
he
gave
to
"
his
dear
old
friends
,
"
Jack
Redburn
and
myself
,
his
house
,
his
books
,
his
furniture
,
---
in
short
,
all
that
his
house
contained
;
and
with
this
legacy
more
ample
means
of
maintaining
it
in
its
present
state
than
we
,
with
our
habits
and
at
our
terms
of
life
,
can
ever
exhaust
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
these
gifts
,
he
left
to
us
,
in
trust
,
an
annual
sum
of
no
insignificant
amount
,
to
be
distributed
in
charity
among
his
accustomed
pensioners
---
they
are
a
long
list
---
and
such
other
claimants
on
his
bounty
as
might
,
from
time
to
time
,
present
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
true
charity
not
only
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
,
but
includes
a
multitude
of
virtues
,
such
as
forgiveness
,
liberal
construction
,
gentleness
and
mercy
to
the
faults
of
others
,
and
the
remembrance
of
our
own
imperfections
and
advantages
,
he
bade
us
not
inquire
too
closely
into
the
venial
errors
of
the
poor
,
but
finding
that
they
WERE
poor
,
first
to
relieve
and
then
endeavour
---
at
an
advantage
---
to
reclaim
them
.
   
<EOS>
To
the
housekeeper
he
left
an
annuity
,
sufficient
for
her
comfortable
maintenance
and
support
through
life
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
barber
,
who
had
attended
him
many
years
,
he
made
a
similar
provision
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
may
make
two
remarks
in
this
place
:
 
first
,
that
I
think
this
pair
are
very
likely
to
club
their
means
together
and
make
a
match
of
it
;
and
secondly
,
that
I
think
my
friend
had
this
result
in
his
mind
,
for
I
have
heard
him
say
,
more
than
once
,
that
he
could
not
concur
with
the
generality
of
mankind
in
censuring
equal
marriages
made
in
later
life
,
since
there
were
many
cases
in
which
such
unions
could
not
fail
to
be
a
wise
and
rational
source
of
happiness
to
both
parties
.
   
<EOS>
The
elder
Mr
Weller
is
so
far
from
viewing
this
prospect
with
any
feelings
of
jealousy
,
that
he
appears
to
be
very
much
relieved
by
its
contemplation
;
and
his
son
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
participates
in
this
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
of
opinion
,
however
,
that
the
old
gentleman
's
danger
,
even
at
its
crisis
,
was
very
slight
,
and
that
he
merely
laboured
under
one
of
those
transitory
weaknesses
to
which
persons
of
his
temperament
are
now
and
then
liable
,
and
which
become
less
and
less
alarming
at
every
return
,
until
they
wholly
subside
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
he
will
remain
a
jolly
old
widower
for
the
rest
of
his
life
,
as
he
has
already
inquired
of
me
,
with
much
gravity
,
whether
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
would
enable
him
to
settle
his
property
upon
Tony
beyond
the
possibility
of
recall
;
and
has
,
in
my
presence
,
conjured
his
son
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
that
in
the
event
of
his
ever
becoming
amorous
again
,
he
will
put
him
in
a
strait
-
waistcoat
until
the
fit
is
past
,
and
distinctly
inform
the
lady
that
his
property
is
"
made
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
Although
I
have
very
little
doubt
that
Sam
would
dutifully
comply
with
these
injunctions
in
a
case
of
extreme
necessity
,
and
that
he
would
do
so
with
perfect
composure
and
coolness
,
I
do
not
apprehend
things
<EOS>
will
ever
come
to
that
pass
,
as
the
old
gentleman
seems
perfectly
happy
in
the
society
of
his
son
,
his
pretty
daughter
-
in-
law
,
and
his
grandchildren
,
and
has
solemnly
announced
his
determination
to
"
take
arter
the
old
'
un
in
all
respects
;
"
from
which
I
infer
that
it
is
his
intention
to
regulate
his
conduct
by
the
model
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
will
certainly
set
him
the
example
of
a
single
life
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
diverged
for
a
moment
from
the
subject
with
which
I
set
out
,
for
I
know
that
my
friend
was
interested
in
these
little
matters
,
and
I
have
a
natural
tendency
to
linger
upon
any
topic
that
occupied
his
thoughts
or
gave
him
pleasure
and
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
His
remaining
wishes
are
very
briefly
told
.
 
<EOS>
He
desired
that
we
would
make
him
the
frequent
subject
of
our
conversation
;
at
the
same
time
,
that
we
would
never
speak
of
him
with
an
air
of
gloom
or
restraint
,
but
frankly
,
and
as
one
whom
we
still
loved
and
hoped
to
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
trusted
that
the
old
house
would
wear
no
aspect
of
mourning
,
but
that
it
would
be
lively
and
cheerful
;
and
that
we
would
not
remove
or
cover
up
his
picture
,
which
hangs
in
our
dining
-
room
,
but
make
it
our
companion
as
he
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
room
,
our
place
of
meeting
,
remains
,
at
his
desire
,
in
its
accustomed
state
;
our
seats
are
placed
about
the
table
as
of
old
;
his
easy
-
chair
,
his
desk
,
his
crutch
,
his
footstool
,
hold
their
accustomed
places
,
and
the
clock
stands
in
its
familiar
corner
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
into
the
chamber
at
stated
times
to
see
that
all
is
as
it
should
be
,
and
to
take
care
that
the
light
and
air
are
not
shut
out
,
for
on
that
point
he
expressed
a
strong
solicitude
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
his
fancy
that
the
apartment
should
not
be
inhabited
;
that
it
should
be
religiously
preserved
in
this
condition
,
and
that
the
voice
of
his
old
companion
should
be
heard
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
My
own
history
may
be
summed
up
in
very
few
words
;
and
even
those
I
should
have
spared
the
reader
but
for
my
friend
's
allusion
to
me
some
time
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
deeper
sorrow
than
the
loss
of
a
child
,
---
<EOS>
an
only
daughter
,
who
is
living
,
and
who
fled
from
her
father
's
house
but
a
few
weeks
before
our
friend
and
I
first
met
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
spoken
of
this
even
to
him
,
because
I
have
always
loved
her
,
and
I
could
not
bear
to
tell
him
of
her
error
until
I
could
tell
him
also
of
her
sorrow
and
regret
.
 
<EOS>
Happily
I
was
enabled
to
do
so
some
time
ago
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
will
not
be
long
,
with
Heaven
's
leave
,
before
she
is
restored
to
me
;
before
I
find
in
her
and
her
husband
the
support
of
my
declining
years
.
   
<EOS>
For
my
pipe
,
it
is
an
old
relic
of
home
,
a
thing
of
no
great
worth
,
a
poor
trifle
,
but
sacred
to
me
for
her
sake
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
since
the
death
of
our
venerable
friend
,
Jack
Redburn
and
<EOS>
I
have
been
the
sole
tenants
of
the
old
house
;
and
,
day
by
day
,
have
lounged
together
in
his
favourite
walks
.
 
<EOS>
Mindful
of
his
injunctions
,
we
have
long
been
able
to
speak
of
him
with
ease
and
cheerfulness
,
and
to
remember
him
as
he
would
be
remembered
.
 
<EOS>
From
certain
allusions
which
Jack
has
dropped
,
to
his
having
been
deserted
and
cast
off
in
early
life
,
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
some
passages
of
his
youth
may
possibly
be
shadowed
out
in
the
history
of
Mr
Chester
and
his
son
,
but
seeing
that
he
avoids
the
subject
,
I
have
not
pursued
it
.
   
<EOS>
My
task
is
done
.
 
<EOS>
The
chamber
in
which
we
have
whiled
away
so
many
hours
,
not
,
I
hope
,
without
some
pleasure
and
some
profit
,
is
deserted
;
our
happy
hour
of
meeting
strikes
no
more
;
the
chimney-
corner
has
grown
cold
;
and
MASTER
HUMPHREY
'S
CLOCK
has
stopped
for
ever
.
